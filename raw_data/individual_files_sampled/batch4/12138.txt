you know a lot of people talk about the problems in our country but CNN is offering a solution hysteria yes according to CNN hysteria especially when combined with mindless rage and deep stores of ignorance are what we need to turn this country around with hysteria you can take almost any problem and turn it into an excuse to deprive individual Americans of their rights and replace those rights with expert bureaucrats who have proved their mettle by turning Europe into a violent and moribund turning Washington into a helpless giant tied down like Gulliver by internal divisions and red tape do you feel helpless when you hear about a shooting at a school do you ask yourself what can I do as an American cNN has the answer become hysterical and hateful and ignorant you might say wait shouldn't I calm down and gather the facts and listen to both sides before making a decision absolutely not why do that when you can listen to a shrieking lynch mob of one-sided know-nothings on CNN and then panic and do the wrong thing are you annoyed that 13 Russian trolls made largely useless efforts to confuse our electoral system do you say to yourself how can we make sure that doesn't happen again CNN knows hysteria hatred and ignorance we'll clean that problem right up by exposing ordinary Americans to ridicule bullying and potential violence especially if they voted for someone CNN doesn't like but CNN isn't just suggesting solutions like hysteria hatred and ignorance they're helping to bring those solutions about by staging fake town halls in which angry activists scream obscene insults of people who know what they're talking about until cowardly elected officials overreact and deprive you of your rights Thanks CNN there's a reason CNN is the most trusted name in news among people running to catch a plane and wondering why cNN has played in all the airports when they're an ugly dishonest leftist trash bin of ill-conceived notions and largely false reporting trying to gin up hysteria hatred and ignorance while you're just trying to catch a damn plane and that's something to be proud of if you're hysterical and hateful and ignorant like CNN trigger warning I'm Andrew Clavin and this is the Andrew Clavin show all right we're back to last day before the Clavin last weekend these weeks shoot by and then it's like you know you shoot by and then you fall off the edge of the universe and you're plunged into Clavin las' darkness possibly forevermore not many people come back from equivalence weekends they come crawling back over the you know over time as the those who have survived you could listen to another Kingdom and stretch it out a little bit I would love it if you show up and listen to the podcast I did with Michael Noel's a fictional thriller a fantasy thriller that's on iTunes or wherever you get your podcasts another Kingdom today we have Sebastian Gorka you know I wanted to do what CNN did last night I wanted to gather a bunch of people with scripted stupid questions angry emotional / emotional people who don't really know very much about an issue and have them scream at people who really actually know what they're talking about but we just couldn't arrange that in time we couldn't get enough hateful people here so we will have Sebastian Gorka who actually does know what he's talking about he'll talk to us about the tweets that President Trump put out today on gun control we sounded like he might have shifted a little bit I'm not quite sure and talked them about Obama gate this is the thing that I just feel is you know it's always ways always have to cover the news but what I want to be talking about is what we now know about the last administration and how it you know abused the levers of government to to curtail political rights in political speech in this country I think is now all coming out after the press buried it and I just like to know what it's about and with what the ramifications are and how much is being fixed and whether Donald Trump is doing anything about it meanwhile though I know that while you're watching the show the thing that you know you want to concentrate on what I'm saying but you just can't get over how great I look you know you think like god I don't even know what he's talking about he just looks so terrific and the reason is I work out constantly I'm constantly exercising

dealing a lot with the way the press takes events that are emotional and interesting and turns them into crises in a way that in their hopes that you will give up your rights as the left always says no crisis should go to waste and so the left is always trying to make everything into a crisis and as I pointed out crime rates are down their way down gun violence down you more guns less crime just true the trolling of a couple of Russians did you know the funny thing about their Russian trolling is they didn't introduce any ideas into the electoral process they simply took care of you know they simply laps themselves on to division that were already there so if you were a trump supporter and you showed up at a trump rally that the russians happened to plan you were still doing exactly what you would have done anyway and it didn't really work very well and they just gin this stuff up into a crisis because they're hoping to undermine Donald Trump do anything they can yesterday though wonderfully kind of delightfully not only did CNN take this absolutely into the stratosphere I mean absolutely into a stratosphere of corruption and ugliness and dishonesty and Jake Tapper you should be ashamed of yourself to even participate in something like that but while they were doing that Donald Trump who listen Donald Trump can be as divisive and as unreliable he could do all this up at Donald but he is an expert in television and so what he did was he met with the survivors not only of this latest shooting in Florida but of other shootings and sat there and listened to them and listened to what they said and what was the difference between the two things the hysterical lynch mob on CNN was scripted and the people who were talking to President Trump were just saying what was on their minds and Trump left the cameras on and let people visit with them you know earlier this week I we went to knuckle head bro do we have knuckle head wrote let's play we got to play our knuckle head Rosemont knuckle head row is the op-ed page of the New York Times and we like to go there to get like the heart the beating heart of the left in the hopes of grabbing hold of it and ripping it out of it like in the second Indiana Jones movie so here's let us travel back to knucklehead row for a minute so earlier earlier in the week we took the chief knucklehead the knucklehead iasts of the knucklehead is on knucklehead row Paul Crewe Matt Krugman and I read this column he wrote about how there's only one side in America essentially the the right is now so hateful that they're not even to be spoke enough he says the character flaws of the party end up being echoed by the character flaws of his most prominent members are they bad people who choose their political affiliation because it fits their proclivities or potentially good people corrupted by the GOP company they keep probably he says some of both in any case let's be clear America and 2018 is not a place where we can disagree without being disagreeable where there are good people and good ideas on both sides it's not that place whatever other bipartisan homily you want to recite this is a nation ruled by the worst okay that's you by the way that's you Paul Krugman is talking about Thomas Friedman also on knucklehead row also one of the top knuckleheads on the among the knuckle heaviest knuckleheads on knuckle head row Thomas Friedman had this to say about our president and this was he was talking about the fact that he didn't react to Vladimir Putin he didn't attack Vladimir Putin after it came out that there that 13 Russians had been indicted not convicted indicted but Trump is not that bothered by this and here is Friedman overreacting to that people are worried about our country this is America our country is at stake our president is a disturbed person and he's behaving in ways that are simply inexplicable that tell you that he is either compromised because the Russians have been funding his company in ways that he's he would find embarrassing you've publicly disclosed that's why he hasn't shown us his tax returns or he's compromised because of maybe behavior he engaged in while in Moscow or he is simply a towering fool who is ignoring the advice of his intelligence chiefs being made in public and when his national security adviser is over in Germany at a conference rather than summoning him home to lead a response to Russia he rebukes him for not properly you know supporting the fact that these things didn't tip the election I'm not they did tip the election I have no idea what the impact is a one way or another what is unacceptable is that this behavior continues and he is not responding so either Trump is in somehow in debt to the Russians he did something in Moscow with the Russian hookers or he's you know got some bad loans to his company from Moscow we don't know what it is but Trump is a Russian spy and the Feather just the fact that he did not overreact to this indictment which again is just an indictment of people who'll never be tried will never have this case proved the fact that he didn't overreact means he's an unstable terrible guy and our democracy is in danger and that's just Friedman saying what he wrote already in the is his column on knucklehead row the interesting thing is even if you try David Brooks kind of went to the New York Times under the disguise of being a conservative but he's not really a conservative he believes that being a conservative is wearing like a blue tie that's what he thinks being a conservative is and he really is a a mild-mannered kind of he's kind of a liberal he worshiped Barack Obama he never covered for Obama when Obama lied but he writes this column called respect first then gun control okay so he wants the gun control but he says if you want this is still on knuckle head row so if you want to stop school shootings it's not enough just event in March it's necessary to let people from red America lead the way and to show respect to gun owners at all points there has to be trust and respect first then we can strike a compromise on guns as guns and not as some sacred cross in the culture war he wants to reach out the left went nuts on Twitter they were cursing him out somebody Damon linker at the week wrote a column called America's addiction to the politics of anger and he said he said more than a few people online seemed to think that this David Brooks column was a provocation to outrage he says I thought what he thought is a thoughtful liberal professor responded what if Brooks had written this column about segregationist rather than opponents of gun control so what if he had then he would have been wrong then he would have been wrong but now he's right he could have done so while barely changing anything else in it except this subject it's like insane this is a thoughtful liberal anyway the linker goes on to say the problem is that the list of things that people on both sides of our ever wider and ever deeper partisan divide considered to be just plain wrong grows longer with each passing day the right thinks that raising taxes or expanding access to affordable health care infringes on the inalienable right to property just as proposals to regulate or restrict gun sales trend groups transgress the enviable right to bear arms rendering these positions unconstitutional immoral and on American the left for its part thinks that favoring lower levels of legal immigration and deportation for those who enter the country illegally and maybe just the act of voting for Donald Trump constitutes incontrovertible evidence of racism while opposing abortion on demand as a sign of sexism upholding the sexual morality of historic Christianity is homophobic bigotry and allowing the easy purchase of ar-15 rifles is barbarism how did we get here and that's always the next question and that's always when they start to blame Fox News which he does in this column that's always like yeah we're terribly divided and it's all Fox News's fault let's take a look at that after we talked about Skillshare Skillshare is another online service where you can get all these videos that teach you how to do stuff I have used them they have all kinds of things at 18,000 classes in design business technology and more you can take classes and social media

Andrew we got Sebastian Gorka coming up and we're gonna stay on but that doesn't mean you shouldn't subscribe yet cheeps not sorry so let's let it we have to look what was wonderful last night is CNN holds whether they call it a Town Hall it was a lynch mob a lynch mob of people all of whom agreed and if you don't think all of them agreed let's start with the crowd okay they start talking about a salt right no it's semi-automatic bands I think they're talking about and the crowd goes nuts just listen these are two instances spliced together cut five but since solutions like getting the assault rifles off the streets start looking at how easy it is to get around it you would literally have a ban every semi-automatic rifle that's what fair enough that's first of all you know this is so dishonest not only is the crowd packed but they're ignorant a semi-automatic I'm not even a gun guy but I know the semi-automatic all that means is when you pull the trigger it reloads so you don't have to you know that would leave Winchester 76 is that's what you'd be using like Jimmy Stewart in an old western you'd be cocking the gun every time and maybe maybe they want you to stuff they like the the revolutionary soldiers to stuff the Gunpowder and with a rod you know it's ignorant that's never going to happen so why are they cheering why are they cheering that because they don't know what a semi-automatic is because they were pulled off the street they were selected to do just what you saw them doing and how do we know that because there's one kid who wouldn't go on Colton hab was a ROTC kid at the school shooting in Florida he used their Kevlar mats to protect students he was a hero kid he wanted to go on and talk about what he wanted to talk about but no and this is the local channel 10 reporting on this on Colton Happ we just refused to do their scripted routine I expected to be able to ask my questions and give my opinion on my questions but Colton hobb a member of the Junior ROTC who's shielded classmates in the midst of Terror says he did not get to share his experience CNN had originally asked me to write a speech in questions and it ended up being all scripted Colton wrote questions about school safety suggested using veterans as armed school security guards but claims CNN wanted him to ask a scripted question instead so he decided not to go I don't think that it's gonna get anything accomplished it's not gonna ask the true questions that all the parents and teachers and students have so so who do they get of course they get all these activist kids and they behaved despicably now the thing is I get it they're emotional they're out of control they're they don't know what they're talking about so why are they on TV and they are on TV because CNN is practicing a form of child abuse called using traumatized kids to sell your political position it's a terrible thing to do it's an immoral thing to do and they do it now these kids have done immoral things on television that they're gonna have to live with when they calm down and realize what they've done here is a in cut six Jake Tapper formerly the man formerly known as a journalist is sitting there while this kid essentially associates Marco Rubio with the shooter as if Rubio were just as bad as the shooter senator Rubio can you tell me right now that you will not accept a single donation from the NRA i wish i wish i could have i wish i could have i wish i could have spoken i wish i could have asked the nra lady a question I wish the nra lady I could have talked to because I would ask her how she can look in the mirror considering the fact that she has children but you know maybe she avoids I don't freaking know I mean that's I mean in tapri just sits there well again ignorance the nra doesn't people don't support the Second Amendment because the NRA gives the money the NRA gives the money because they support the Second Amendment again these are the tools of ignorance this is taking advantage of their ignorance to sell us Ritchie what are they cheering about what are they cheering about Marco Rubio supports the Second Amendment so he gets money from the NRA why should he turn that down the NRA is supporting your gun rights you're right and talking about the girl from the NRA that he wanted to confront that's Dana lash who is a terrific girl I really like her but she she was getting attacked by she had this other students attacking her and saying you're not a good mother I would support your kids but you're not supporting my kids and when she starts to answer back cuz she really knows her stuff she when she starts to answer back they call her a murderer or maybe you could listen to this crowd this is oh you know lynch mobs or why people have guns so this is just a good example of why you should always go armed because the this is these are the people CNN want to take running your life this is cut number three you can shout me down when I'm finished but let me answer in this question it is not federal law for states to report convictions to the end of the NICS system it's not it's not federally mandated we had three lawmakers on this stage and only one of them hinted at reinforcing the background check system it is only as good as the records submitted to it only one of them even got anywhere close to mentioning that we have to have more than 38 states submit records that's number one number two we have to develop better protocol to follow up on red flags so so this really makes me want to give up my gun you know when I see this mob shouting murderer at dana lash that makes me think yeah oh I'm safe in my rights oh I'm safe in my arm I'm safe in my Constitution oh this makes me want to go out and get like it smelt a Gatling gun on the top of my house to keep these people away CNN just pulled its pants down I mean this is the thing it's like in some ways in some ways we should be glad that they came out and showed what hateful dishonest disreputable people they are at that network you know that it really is good for us I think the NRA must be like just standing outside with bags to put the money in this must be flowing into them at this point meanwhile meanwhile Donald Trump sits down with people and in this incredibly emotional moment lets them say the things that they have to say get there was no scripting there maybe maybe he had notes but there was no scripting there from the people and he let them say what they had to say and some of it was just I mean it was heart-wrenching let's just play this student cut number 11 just to let you know what what Trump he left the cameras rolling and he let people see him taking this kind of blast me and my friends we get scared when a car drives by anywhere I don't understand I turned 18 the day after woke up to the news that my best friend was gone and I don't understand why I could still go in a store and buy a weapon of war an AR I was reading today that a person 20 years old walked into a store and bought an ar-15 in five minutes with an expired ID how is it that easy to buy this type of weapon how do we not stop this after Columbine after I'm sitting with a mother that lost it it's still happening now that story that he tells which chris cuomo touted on CNN is not true that's not a true story that CNN spreading misinformation dishonest stuff and now it goes back to the Trump but at least Trump sat there and took it you know he actually sat there and sustained the blast and one of the things he said was that he wanted to have teachers trained so that they were on the site I mean most most shootings take a few minutes the cops can't get there in time if you have people on the site you know one of the parents got up and said we had 9/11 and we solved the problem why haven't we solved the problem here well after 9/11 they put armed men on the plane there were more guns on planes and you don't know who they are and that was one of the way and we got sébastien corchia excellent let us bring on sebastian gore and talk to him about what happened next sebastian Gorka is a military and intelligence analyst Fox News strategist and former deputy assistant to President Trump he's also the author of The New York Times bestseller defeating jihad and he is at CPAC have you at CPAC I am I'm hiding in the green room to do this interview with you I appreciate it I appreciate they never they never invite me to CPAC but I've the one time I was there I enjoyed it it's always a really nice event it's beautiful it's nice to see all the young conservatives show up it gives you hope so this morning President Trump tweeted out that he said I'll be strongly pushing comprehensive background checks something I think most of us support we want this he says an emphasis on mental health he wants to end the sale of bump stock something the NRA supports I don't know how useful that will be but he also says I want to raise the age to buying a gun 221 something the NRA will never support and most people don't support is he going soft do you do you worry about Donald Trump in this regard do you think he's going soft on this issue look as an avid pro-gun Second Amendment guy not really because he's hit the nail on the head you've outlined it it's clear from your autobiography it's even clear from you know your fictional work like the kingdom that you understand evil exists evil isn't it isn't just you know something in fairy tales it walks the earth you can never a rat on this earth you will never eradicate it that's what communists said they were doing and look what they did so what we have to have here is a realistic approach to how you deal with that evil and it's not the gun it's not the inanimate object when the president says the mental health issue is key here he's absolutely right there's no legislation that will stop a terrorist there's no legislation that will stop a bank robber and guess what there's no legislation that was which will stop a mentally impaired individual who's paranoid or schizophrenic from killing other people unless we do what have a system that identifies them that helps them that reaches out to them since the 1970s drew thanks to the left and to actually a Supreme Court decision it is almost impossible to adjudicate somebody as mentally deficient so they must be instead institutionalized right you can base it's basically impossible look at New York right look at the streets of New York look at the beggars a lot of those people would be where they would be having three square meals in a mental institution being helped but you can't put them there for more than 72 hours and some of them are walk kids who need help they'll steal a gum they'll steal a car it's it's it bears repeating in France 82 people were murdered by a man who stole a truck like what legislation is gonna stop that now yeah think so yeah and sorry just finished your key question you have to understand something how the present the left will never believe never believed to their dying debt to their dying breath he's a compassionate man he is a massively compassionate man he loves this country he's an outsider he's like on a class but when he sees those children who are victims who've survived it pulls on his heartstrings but at the same time he's a pragmatist and I think that's what his tweets talk to it's not about fracturing the base it's about a pragmatic response to a crisis loving gun rights but in mental health I wanna I completely agree with this and I think the crisis and mental health and homelessness is it's insane that that's not what they're covering at this point but I want to ask you one more question about this and I want to move into some of the news of this coming out about the Obama administration what they did while they were in office but I want to ask you one more thing I went one got the feeling with Ronald Reagan that if his it entire cabinet stocked with communists he still would have been against the Soviet Union now you you you left the Trump administration feeling that Donald Trump was being surrounded by people who were not maybe as supportive as of his agenda as you were you thought that maybe that they would come back and some of these people would leave I don't see I don't see that happening maybe I'm wrong it do worry that he is is not as grounded and not grounded enough in principle so that he can be swayed by the wrong voices I don't because he has a truly preternatural instinct to do the right thing and I'll give you an example and if I shared this last time I apologize but but maybe I didn't I had a cabinet member tell me and I'm not going to say who it was that on the Jerusalem decision to move our embassy only three members of the president's cabinet supported him three members right and at the end of the day despite what everybody else was telling it's going to be a disaster there'll be crisis our embassies will be in flames the president said you know what I promised the American people I promised our friends Israel oh and by the way it's the right thing to do morally so I'm going to do it it's stunning I mean it's truly stunning so that's why at the end of the day however deep and broad the swamp is I have faith in this man because his instincts are good drew you've made the point that he learns on the job he does that he learned the job but his instincts his default instincts are on always right you know you're you've always been such an eloquent defender of this administration that I hate to tea you up like I hate to give you questions in your wheelhouse but I can't help it I mean I've been watching the revelations that have been coming out about the Obama administration and on top of that I've been watching the press working to suppress the information to keep the public from learning what happened during the Obama administration I've now think it's perfectly fair to call it Obama gate the the way well what do you feel without overstating it I mean don't push it just what do you feel we know at this point about the way Obama used the levers of power to attack Donald Trump during the campaigns it's so difficult where to begin because we can go back to the IRS we can talk about all kinds of things yet we just talked about FISA gate and I agree drew we should be calling this Obama gate this is this is the bare minimum what we know is Hillary Clinton basically paid for and bought an illegal surveillance warrant to spy on an American who was part of the opposition campaign that's what she did through her bodies at DOJ at yeah who are political appointees these aren't agents most of these people are lawyers were put there by Obama at the highest level and she spent 12 million dollars to buy opposition opposition research that was from Russia this is massive this is Russian fantasy material that was taken to a secret court and at the court the FBI and the DOJ signed off at director level hid the exculpatory evidence that this is opposition research and a surveillance warrant was issued legally that's perjury and abuse of power she bought a warrant to spy on an American which is fine fine in a banana republic but not in America you know we have to remind ourselves this is very special reason why America since 1776 never created an mi5 we don't have a political police we don't have an agency that job is to spy on Americans you have to go to a very special court you have to have really good proof that there's something suspicious happening before will allow you spy on an american hillary bought that right and lasting drew this is the tip of the iceberg because you know what's a bigger scandal than even this the unmasking now there's you and the powers thing yeah when when a um and UN ambassador puts in more than two hundred requests in one year to unmask US Nationals caught up in surveillance she's not even part of the intelligence community drew that's outrageous so 2018 is going to be a mighty interesting year where do you stand on the Jeff Sessions question I know there seems to be at least some tension between Trump and Jeff Sessions I've always liked sessions but he he sand now he says he's looking into Pfizer abuse do you think he is going to get to the bottom of this do you think he's work it this is something that interests him and has caught his imagination I promised the president when I left that I'm not here I'm here to support him from the outside I'm not gonna attack individual members of his cabinet or his administration I'll say look Jeff Sessions put his reputation on the line the first senator to endorse candidate Trump he's an honorable man he's a good Patriot I'm not sure he understood the scope of the corruption at DOJ because your Obama administration politicized everything I mean they politicized the IRS right but worst of the worst and I know this from the people inside the worst politicization was the if you're JS of vipers death under the Obama administration it became a weapon of the White House so his job is a massive job but I believe he believes he's committed to getting to the bottom of it but the problem is drew our base those who voted for Trump are very impatient I understand their impatience but to do these things illegally because we believe in rule of law takes time right so patient so you'd okay so you're backing him you just feels gonna take that fair enough I kind of feel the same way I mean I've always I've always liked the guy he's never shown any kind of sign of dishonesty or bigotry so I think it's worth waiting for him the final thing I have to ask you is about this Russian this indictment of thirteen Russian rolls which seem is it does seem to me to be blown out of proportion but we don't want these guys messing around with our country the big hit on Trump over the over this is that he doesn't seem to be angry about it he hasn't come out and said you know that rotten Putin lied to my face he always you know it's funny the Trump administration has been very hard on Russia they have been much harder on Russia than the Obama administration's it's just no question there's no comparison but the rhetoric isn't there and that you know that's part of what the president does is speak from the bully pulpit is Trump missing an opportunity is there some reason the Trump doesn't see that he should be hammering Putin a little bit I'm not sure I'm the best person to ask my father was imprisoned by communist the age of 20 so I don't love former KGB Colonels so yeah I would make my day to have the president rail against the Kremlin but the president of pragmatist he knows this is bad what they did but again it's very important to understand when he said I'm not interested in making new enemies he means that he doesn't want to kick a hornet's nest unnecessarily and in the case of it be very cautious here this is this is my area when you're talking about information warfare and subterfuge sometimes the best actions are covert right if you really want to deal with this you do it in the classified arena with black programs with classified programs I can assure you we can't discuss it here guess what we're doing stuff about what Russia is doing in America right now as we are you know making this show does the president have to get on a soapbox and do it I'd like him to does he have to not really hmm Sebastian Gorka always good to talk to you I'm glad you're down at CPAC I know it's a fun place to be if you see Shapiro I send them home we we need about I'll talk to you again thank you know I have to say I always hate to give him questions in his wheelhouse because he's so good good good what what he does but I think it really this thing with the Obama gate is just fascinating we'll talk about it more when the news quiets down a little bit I just want to end this conversation about what happened yesterday difference between Donald Trump and CNN and Donald Trump and the opponents of gun rights you know one parent got up and said that he wanted to see teachers armed in schools and Trump responded and he had a very positive response to this is cut ten your concept and your idea about school concealed carry and it's it only works where you have people very adept at using firearms of which you have many and it would be teachers and coaches if the coach had a firearm in his locker when he ran at this guy that coach was very brave saved a lot of lives I suspect but if he had a firearm he wouldn't had a run he would have shot and that would have been the end of it and this would only be obviously for people that are very adept at handling a gun and it would be it's called concealed carry where a teacher would have a concealed gun on them they'd go for special training and they would be there and you would no longer have a gun-free zone gun-free zone to a maniac because they're all cowards a gun-free zone is let's go in and let's attack and and that is literally true Amanda presto on our own site today has an article about this according to the crime prevention Research Center gun-free zones areas where guns are prohibited have been the target of more than 98 percent of all mass shootings that's a staggering that is an amazing amazing number so he's talking about having armed people and the arguments against this in my opinion are all emotional oh they're teachers they should teach they shouldn't carry guns hey if we have a problem let them carry guns and make sure they're trained now let's go back comparing Trump comparing this dangerous horrible unstable man to CNN okay which side are we on here here's their CNN's legal expert Jeffrey Toobin reacting to the suggestion personally I'm Pro rancor I'm Pro vitriol I am Pro someone doing something about this rather than being polite when you hear the president and the United States say the answer is to give every teacher in America a gun that is insane that is an insane idea as Mark mark Barden one of the fathers of it who lost a child in who lost a child in Sandy Hook whose wife is a teacher I mean seriously did anybody go to school here does anybody remember their teachers do you think we should give all of them guns I mean do you think do you think they want guns I mean it's just what kind of country do we live in when we're talking about giving every teacher in America a gun but that's a solution to this problem so you you have ears to hear with you heard what Donald Trump said he said specially trained adept people with guns and you heard what Jeffrey Toobin said give every teacher a gun you can't give every teacher a gun I mean it's not even it's not even like reacting to what the president the United States says it's just complete lie you know Obama Trump's popularity rating is now up to 48% which is 3% higher than Obama's was at this point at on this day okay now I obviously polls have their you know preview margins of error and all this stuff but I think that this is meat and drink not just to him but to us I think to watch these people dissolve into hatred and right you know he's calling for it he's saying I want rancor I want vitriol I want stupidity I want ignorant I want hysteria I want hate and I'm supposed to then say oh well in that case I'll give up my gun and you know I mean if you're gonna hate me if you're gonna take my rights away if you're gonna gather crowds and you're gonna script the news you know and you're gonna turn basically be running a prompt for the left but the first thing that I want to do I want to turn over my gun I think if this if you look at this week this you know week with the star to have this tragedy in it if you look at this an argument between the left and the right I think last night the right one and I think when you have one grout calling for hysteria and the other crowd listening maneuvering compromising even compromising saying maybe we should raise the the age of buying a gun to 21 which I don't agree with I don't think is ever gonna happen one side selling ignorance and the other selling you know listening finding the way go going forward you know this is still America I think the side that is reasonable is going to win all right let's do stuff I like so we always have this if you can see you if you're just listening you don't know there's but we have this lovely little you know image for stuff I like but all our other episodes portion you know segments have music you know so I don't know now I'm just gonna sing it you know stuff I like stuff I beat ppppp of something and that's not gonna work yesterday I went to Disneyland my daughter and her family and my grandson and her time I my daughter only had a child so she was an excuse to go to Disneyland you know it's like the kid is like I don't want to go to here going that I love no she she said she said herself I I have the child as cover to get me into Disneyland basic as she is a Disney fanatic she loves Disneyland and you know I was walking around the place is crowded it's yesterday was Wednesday it's right after a holiday so you think things would be slow it's not I mean it's it's a crowded place I'm just thinking is there any other brand besides maybe the American flag is there any other brand anywhere that is as successful as Disneyland as Disney has been I mean they call it the happiest place on earth I think the daily wire is the happiest place on earth but you know here when we have mics we put out poison you know that's it's clean we do have you know that guy that you think is Ben Shapiro but is really just a different cast member everyday wearing a big ben shapiro head but but you know it's amazing that this picture of a mouse this drawing of a mouse is now has reached almost cultic proportions it is an international symbol it's an American symbol is a symbol of like entertainment and happiness and innocence and joy the left is now working to destroy this with his identity politics you know in Hollywood now I have this on absolutely good authority on Hollywood now producers and studios are calling up a it's insane we need a black writer for this we need a Latino write we need a female writer for this but instead of we need the best writer we need the writer who does this you know who really knows what he's talking about it really has gotten very ugly and Disney is kind of part of this they've sworn you know while while their guys are being carted out they had another like gays sex scandal over there why that while their guys are being carted out the door for sexual impropriety you know they've said Oh we'll never have a princess rescued by a prince again yep because girls don't like seeing that you know which is ridiculous of course you should do it you're not you're not changing minds you're simply telling the stories that people want to hear I think identity politics has damaged the brand if the if the left can destroy the NFL it can destroy Disney too I mean this is a very successful company built by a Christian conservative guy who knew exactly what America wanted to see and you don't a brand just doesn't become that it has to be nurtured it has to be created you have to give the audience what they want and Disney did that and I don't think I don't know if it's doing it anymore however since we're talking about stuff I like I have to say the last movie it's really Pixar but Pixar as part of Disney now the last movie I saw that I thought was great was Toy Story 3 and Toy Story 3 is the most right-wing movie ever made I tweet I wrote an article about it it was in the LA Times I wrote an article in the LA Times and the director was screaming at me he was a tweeting get your politics off my movie but come on it's all the little toys you know in Toy Story all the toys come to life first of all this is about Andy the kid who owns the toys going to college and I saw it with my son who was leaving for college like the next week or something like that no we were wearing those 3d glasses and I almost drown you know like tears but they send these toys to a daycare center I think it's called Sunnyside and one of the dummer toys the bear says oh there's a rainbow here so it must be nice you know and Sunnyside they offer to take care of everything and Ken is lives there and he is a feminized man who does nothing but love clothes and of course this turns out to be the center of all evil here's the introduction we they pretend that Sunnyside is the Obama administration's going to take care of you from birth to death but later we find out it is the center of all evil folks if you want to step right this way I'm Ken Barbie mom can recess don't last forever right on lot so this way everybody you got a lot to look forward to folks the little ones love new toys that nice bear folks if I can share here at Sunnyside we've got well just about anything a toy could ask for spare parts superglue and enough fresh batteries to choke a Hungry Hungry Hippos thank you getting old please stop your worries hurry bear Spock will keep your stuff and this well this is where I live Ken's dream house disco it's gonna do buggy and the whole room just for trying on clothes everything except someone to share with you know Toy Story always represent has always been a story about America the two heroes or Buzz Lightyear and woody is the is the cowboy the cowboy obviously America's past Buzz Lightyear America's space adventure future in this movie it's the cowboy the figure of the lone American the individualist America gets the fact that this place is no good that this place that seems to be a paradise where you're taken care of is actually a trap it is the guy from the future Buzz Lightyear who gets indoctrinated into being part of it it is a great conservative movie I wish conservatives would say this stuff out loud without putting it in cartoons and behind Batman masks I wish they would just come out and make movies with these values but we are still too stupid to realize there is too much of too Philistine to realize that this is where minds are made and where minds are changed that you wouldn't have as many of those activist kids at CNN at that lynch mob at CNN you wouldn't have as many as if they were growing up in with movies and classes and news channels that they could turn to they told them the truth about America that really told them what America is based on it is something we have just let go hey today I believe is the day our beloved Lindsay Boren who is the girl the woohoo girl from our mailbag she yeah it used to be my makeup lady she used to do all kinds of things here but today is the day she's she put out a picture she tweeted this picture of her just yeah she's just got like that baby looks like it's about to just walk out of there and I think she has she has scheduled the delivery for today so we our prayers are with her and our love is with her and I will end she is a singer talented singer she does a lot of work down in Texas and she wrote a song for
