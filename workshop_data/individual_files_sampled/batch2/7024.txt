President Trump hosted a White House ceremony on Friday to celebrate and praise American athletes who competed in the 2018 Olympic Games and in that speech he called Paralympians tough to watch let's take a look at a video so today on behalf of the United States I want to thank every Olympian and Paralympian and that was just incredible and what happened with the Paralympics was so incredible and so inspiring to me and I watched it's a little tough to watch too much but I watched as much as I could it was really fantastic and I want to thank you so some other Olympians didn't like this characterization specifically Adam rippen who competed in the 2018 games said on in a tweet Olympians from the 2018 games have been invited to go to the White House today I will not be going I will not stand with people who discriminate against those who they perceive as different and Luth going to DC I have donated to a few of my favorite causes that was included Red Cross GLAAD and it listed several other Olympians in that tweet below sub tweet that would also not be attending including Chloe Kim the Paralympic Games also chimed in on this saying record numbers around the world are not finding Paralympics tough to watch millions of viewers now take the Paralympics in hundreds of countries around the world we hope the US president continues to watch and be inspired by the Paralympics so tough to watch you could characterize this as him saying he doesn't have enough time to watch this I would say cut down on Fox & Friends you will find plenty of time to watch the Paralympics but I think there's a lot of evidence to show that he does mean probably the meaning that rippin and the Paralympic Games got he has let's say a history of making fun of people with different abilities than himself including a reporter that he mocked I think we have that on video so what happens is the Washington Post writes an article and one of the paragraphs it says and by the way this was right after September 11th this was September 18th and right after sort of an amazing thing right after a couple of good paragraphs instead of talking about northern New Jersey draws the probers eye written by a nice reporter now the poor guy you got to see this guy oh I don't know what I said I don't remember he's gonna like how to remember I had the old baby that's what I said there's a 14 years ago he still they didn't do a retraction 14 years ago they did no retraction Trump has also been noted in reportedly making fun of John McCain who is a war veteran who was captured and suffers disabilities to this day from that he has also made fun of Mitch McConnell in a similar way though he does cut himself slack for his abilities for instance he did he did cite bone spurs for a 5 to 5 time deferment from serving the country and then was chauffeured through Sicily last year in a golf cart rather than walk with other g7 global leaders so at least he's nice to someone about their abilities I love stories like this I mean it's obviously terrible like why say it right it's just so it's just so obvious but the reason why I love stories like this is because I love watching people who have called themselves intellectuals for the past however many years retro actively try to assign any sort of cogent thought or intelligence to what Trump is saying at any given moment because he is an absolute idiotic narcissistic man baby and he'll say whatever in this instance he was literally looking for praise like he was like guys I watched the Paralympics like being a president's very tough it was tough to watch but you know I watched parts of it won't you congratulate me like how how stupid can you be but then you have you know a ton of people that graduated from freaking Harvard trying to be like no no he was actually saying because you were saying that was tough to watch because you know our president is so hard-working there's just like sweating the entire time trying to be like come on just shut up Trump don't say anything else it's such a confirmation by for sure I mean I have people I I did a video about like Trump being a jerk like this and they wrote like he would be like Indiana Jones and beat up the Nazis no first of all if he has alleged bone spurs he can't do this I it's just ridiculous to see this being argued with absolutely no evidence and to have these ideas kind of just reflected on this person remember he was he was also criticizing the Broward County Police where he said sorry cooperate he was like I would have ran inside I would have absolutely ran inside he's such a coward but he thinks he'll be able to do this stuff and to me that speaks to the heart of all of the maggots odds because they to feel like they would be John Rambo when the situation arose they to feel inappropriately that they have they excel physically they also believe in white supremacy so they look at a guy like LeBron and think like I'm better than him because my skin is the fairer color they all talk tough he is a boorish a-hole that's not a breaking news story we know Trump sabores a-hole and somebody says Boris a whole things you can't really be surprised this is extraordinary I think as House says he's kind of like you know just saying what comes to mind because he really is just that he's just a bunch of reflexes and then he just starts talking and then of course there's hypocrisy and sort of this insane hypocrisy when it comes to his own physicality or lack thereof when it comes to actually examining what he says but yeah don't try to make sense of it he is just a boorish a-hole and so he says that stuff that come falls into that category two easy ways for Young Turks one is hit the subscribe button down below then you're a TYT
