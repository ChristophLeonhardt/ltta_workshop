1
00:00:00,690 --> 00:00:01,724
IMPORTANT THAN SCORING CHEAP

2
00:00:01,724 --> 00:00:02,859
POLITICAL POINTS AGAINST A

3
00:00:02,859 --> 00:00:04,627
PRESIDENT YOU DIDN'T VOTE FOR.

4
00:00:04,627 --> 00:00:06,529
DON'T YOU THINK?

5
00:00:06,529 --> 00:00:08,064
THAT'S THE "ANGLE."

6
00:00:08,064 --> 00:00:12,769
NOW AS PROMISED MY EXCLUSIVE

7
00:00:12,769 --> 00:00:16,172
INTERVIEW WITH ATTORNEY FOR

8
00:00:16,172 --> 00:00:16,806
PRESIDENT TRUMP.

9
00:00:16,806 --> 00:00:17,507
RUDY GIULIANI.

10
00:00:17,507 --> 00:00:20,243
WE ARE JOINED BY FORMER NEW YORK

11
00:00:20,243 --> 00:00:23,513
MAYOR AND COUNSEL TO THE TRUMP

12
00:00:23,513 --> 00:00:23,846
TEAM.

13
00:00:23,846 --> 00:00:26,616
YOU MADE A LOT OF NEWS LAST TIME

14
00:00:26,616 --> 00:00:28,051
YOU WERE ON THE NETWORK.

15
00:00:28,051 --> 00:00:31,587
WHAT WAS THE ISSUE?

16
00:00:31,587 --> 00:00:33,690
REIMBURSEMENT OF PAYMENTS TO

17
00:00:33,690 --> 00:00:38,094
MICHAEL COHEN FOR THE STORMY

18
00:00:38,094 --> 00:00:38,861
DANIELS SETTLEMENT.

19
00:00:38,861 --> 00:00:42,265
WE FOUND OUT THE PRESIDENT DID

20
00:00:42,265 --> 00:00:43,433
DISCLOSE THAT.

21
00:00:43,433 --> 00:00:46,169
WAS THIS DONE A COUPLE OF WEEKS

22
00:00:46,302 --> 00:00:47,770
>> YES, AND THE PRESIDENT WAS

23
00:00:47,770 --> 00:00:49,973
AWARE OF IT AND ENDORSED A

24
00:00:49,973 --> 00:00:50,340
STRATEGY.

25
00:00:50,340 --> 00:00:52,709
WE WOULD NOT DO IT WITHOUT HIM.

26
00:00:52,709 --> 00:00:55,178
HE IS THE SILENT.

27
00:00:55,178 --> 00:00:57,780
HE HAS TREMENDOUS JUDGMENT ABOUT

28
00:00:57,780 --> 00:01:00,116
THINGS LIKE THIS.

29
00:01:00,116 --> 00:01:02,452
THEY AGREED WITH US IT HAD BEEN

30
00:01:02,452 --> 00:01:04,754
FULLY DISCLOSED.

31
00:01:04,754 --> 00:01:06,522
I HAD A LITTLE DISAGREEMENT WITH

32
00:01:06,522 --> 00:01:07,457
HIM BUT IT'S PETTY.

33
00:01:07,457 --> 00:01:12,095
I DON'T BELIEVE IT HAD TO BE

34
00:01:12,095 --> 00:01:13,896
EXPOSED.

35
00:01:13,896 --> 00:01:17,834
I SAY IT WAS AN EXPENDITURE.

36
00:01:17,834 --> 00:01:20,803
>> Laura: AND HE SAYS IT'S A

37
00:01:20,803 --> 00:01:21,170
LIABILITY?

38
00:01:21,170 --> 00:01:24,540
>> IT'S IMPORTANT FOR DISCLOSURE

39
00:01:24,540 --> 00:01:24,907
PURPOSES.

40
00:01:24,907 --> 00:01:27,610
WHICH WE DECIDED OUT OF CAUTION

41
00:01:27,610 --> 00:01:30,713
WE WOULD DISCLOSE THIS.

42
00:01:30,713 --> 00:01:31,781
>> Laura: HE SAID THAT THE

43
00:01:31,781 --> 00:01:35,051
PAYMENT MADE BY MR. MICHAEL

44
00:01:35,051 --> 00:01:37,620
COHEN IS REQUIRED TO BE REPORTED

45
00:01:37,620 --> 00:01:43,826
AS A LIABILITY.

46
00:01:43,826 --> 00:01:45,395
>> WE AGREE WITH THAT.

47
00:01:45,395 --> 00:01:46,629
HE DISCLOSED IT.

48
00:01:46,629 --> 00:01:48,831
WE DON'T AGREE -- I DON'T AGREE

49
00:01:48,831 --> 00:01:49,665
IT'S A LIABILITY.

50
00:01:49,665 --> 00:01:53,936
BECAUSE I KNOW THE NATURE OF IT.

51
00:01:53,936 --> 00:01:56,973
IT DIDN'T MATTER AT THIS POINT.

52
00:01:56,973 --> 00:02:00,109
>> Laura: ANOTHER FORMER ETHICES

53
00:02:00,109 --> 00:02:03,012
OFFICER SAID THIS IS A

54
00:02:03,012 --> 00:02:05,181
TANTAMOUNT TO A CRIMINAL

55
00:02:05,181 --> 00:02:05,548
REFERRAL.

56
00:02:05,548 --> 00:02:06,849
>> [LAUGHING].

57
00:02:06,849 --> 00:02:09,051
NO IT'S NOT.

58
00:02:09,051 --> 00:02:12,288
YOU JUST LEAD THE LANGUAGE.

59
00:02:12,288 --> 00:02:17,460
>> Laura: ANOTHER OFFICER SAID:

60
00:02:17,460 --> 00:02:20,096
>> NO, IT'S NOT.

61
00:02:20,096 --> 00:02:25,768
IF IT WAS IT WOULD SAY CRIMINAL

62
00:02:25,768 --> 00:02:26,135
REFERRAL.

63
00:02:26,135 --> 00:02:27,804
THE PRESIDENT CAN'T DISCLOSE

64
00:02:27,804 --> 00:02:29,505
MORE THAN HE KNOWS.

65
00:02:29,505 --> 00:02:32,508
WE ARE VERY COMFORTABLE WITH IT

66
00:02:32,508 --> 00:02:33,476
AND MUELLER SHOULD BRING THIS TO

67
00:02:33,476 --> 00:02:34,510
A CLOSE.

68
00:02:34,510 --> 00:02:37,413
IT'S BEEN A YEAR.

69
00:02:37,413 --> 00:02:38,815
1.4-MILLION DOCUMENTS AND

70
00:02:38,815 --> 00:02:40,183
INTERVIEWED 28 WITNESSES AND HE

71
00:02:40,183 --> 00:02:41,017
HAS NOTHING.

72
00:02:41,017 --> 00:02:42,452
WHICH IS WHY HE WANTS TO BRING

73
00:02:42,452 --> 00:02:43,786
THE PRESIDENT TO AN INTERVIEW.

74
00:02:43,786 --> 00:02:44,587
WE DEMAND:

75
00:02:44,587 --> 00:02:46,722
TELL US WHAT YOU HAVE TO GET

76
00:02:46,722 --> 00:02:48,391
FROM AN INTERVIEW THAT YOU DON'T

77
00:02:48,391 --> 00:02:48,958
ALREADY HAVE?

78
00:02:48,958 --> 00:02:50,893
HE HAS ALL OF THE FACTS TO MAKE

79
00:02:50,893 --> 00:02:51,661
A DECISION.

80
00:02:51,661 --> 00:02:53,129
>> Laura: WHY WOULD YOU AGREE TO

81
00:02:53,129 --> 00:02:54,697
AN INTERVIEW NOW?

82
00:02:54,697 --> 00:02:56,666
A LOT OF FORMER CRIMINAL DEFENSE

83
00:02:56,666 --> 00:03:00,303
ATTORNEYS HAVE MULLED THIS FOR

84
00:03:00,303 --> 00:03:00,670
SOMETIME.

85
00:03:00,670 --> 00:03:03,172
GIVEN EVERYTHING DISCOVERED

86
00:03:03,172 --> 00:03:06,375
ABOUT HOLDING BACK DOCUMENTS,

87
00:03:06,375 --> 00:03:08,044
WHY WOULD YOU AGREE UNDER ANY

88
00:03:08,044 --> 00:03:09,745
CIRCUMSTANCES TO ALLOW PRESIDENT

89
00:03:09,745 --> 00:03:10,279
TRUMP TO GO THERE?

90
00:03:10,279 --> 00:03:12,215
>> THERE WOULD BE A NARROW AREA

91
00:03:12,215 --> 00:03:13,783
WHERE WE MIGHT AGREE IF THEY

92
00:03:13,783 --> 00:03:16,853
COULD TELL US WHY THEY NEED IT.

93
00:03:16,853 --> 00:03:18,688
THEY HAVE HIS EXPLANATIONS OF

94
00:03:18,688 --> 00:03:20,590
EVERYTHING AND 1.4 MILLION

95
00:03:20,590 --> 00:03:22,391
DOCUMENTS AND WITNESSES.

96
00:03:22,391 --> 00:03:23,926
IF THEY ARE GOING TO DISBELIEVE

97
00:03:23,926 --> 00:03:25,695
HIM, THEY ARE GOING TO

98
00:03:25,695 --> 00:03:26,262
DISBELIEVE HIM.

99
00:03:26,262 --> 00:03:28,531
THE FACT IS WE HAVE TO KNOW WHAT

100
00:03:28,531 --> 00:03:31,067
DO YOU WANT CLARIFIED?

101
00:03:31,067 --> 00:03:35,404
IF THEY TOLD US, IF WE GAVE THE

102
00:03:35,404 --> 00:03:36,639
EXPLANATION, THEY WOULD END IT,

103
00:03:36,639 --> 00:03:36,939
FINE.

104
00:03:36,939 --> 00:03:38,474
WE ARE TRYING TO GET THEM TO END

105
00:03:38,474 --> 00:03:38,774
THIS.

106
00:03:38,774 --> 00:03:41,377
THIS IS NOT GOOD FOR THE

107
00:03:41,377 --> 00:03:42,578
AMERICAN PEOPLE.

108
00:03:42,578 --> 00:03:45,114
THE SPECIAL COUNSEL'S OFFICE

109
00:03:45,114 --> 00:03:46,349
DOESN'T UNDERSTAND THEY ARE

110
00:03:46,349 --> 00:03:47,917
INTERFERING WITH THINGS BIGGER

111
00:03:47,917 --> 00:03:48,851
THAN THEM OR US.

112
00:03:48,851 --> 00:03:51,888
>> Laura: YOU SAID THERE IS A

113
00:03:51,888 --> 00:03:54,857
PLAN-B AND C IF MUELLER DOESN'T

114
00:03:54,857 --> 00:03:57,493
WRAP THIS UP.

115
00:03:57,493 --> 00:04:00,530
GOING INTO THE SECOND YEAR.

116
00:04:00,530 --> 00:04:02,932
YOU KNOW HOW MUCH TIME THIS

117
00:04:02,932 --> 00:04:03,232
TAKES.

118
00:04:03,232 --> 00:04:03,966
BILL CLINTON FOUND THAT OUT?

119
00:04:03,966 --> 00:04:06,502
>> WE WILL DEMAND AN ANSWER.

120
00:04:06,502 --> 00:04:08,304
WE COOPERATED BEYOND ANY OTHER

121
00:04:08,304 --> 00:04:09,372
PRESIDENT EVER COOPERATED.

122
00:04:09,372 --> 00:04:11,774
ALL OF THOSE DOCUMENTS, 1.4

123
00:04:11,774 --> 00:04:14,744
MILLION AND ALL OF THOSE

124
00:04:14,744 --> 00:04:15,111
WITNESSES.

125
00:04:15,111 --> 00:04:17,680
>> Laura: WHAT IS THE PLAN-B AND

126
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:19,447
C.

127
00:04:19,447 --> 00:04:23,886
FIRING MUELLER OR COMEY?

128
00:04:23,886 --> 00:04:25,855
>> NO, THEN WE START FROM DAY 1

129
00:04:25,855 --> 00:04:26,155
AGAIN.

130
00:04:26,155 --> 00:04:29,592
WE WILL FIND OUT WHAT LEGAL

131
00:04:29,592 --> 00:04:30,726
REMEDIES ARE AVAILABLE TO US

132
00:04:30,726 --> 00:04:32,528
INCLUDING CHALLENGING A

133
00:04:32,528 --> 00:04:32,895
SUBPOENA.

134
00:04:32,895 --> 00:04:36,232
THE SAME REASON THEY CAN'T

135
00:04:36,232 --> 00:04:37,033
INDICT HIM.

136
00:04:37,033 --> 00:04:38,234
>> Laura: WHICH MUELLER AGREED

137
00:04:38,234 --> 00:04:38,834
TO TODAY.

138
00:04:38,834 --> 00:04:40,703
>> I DON'T THINK THEY AGREE TO

139
00:04:40,703 --> 00:04:41,504
THE PROCESS QUESTION.

140
00:04:41,504 --> 00:04:43,339
THE SAME REASON THEY CAN'T

141
00:04:43,339 --> 00:04:45,508
INDICT HIM, THEY CAN'T ISSUE A

142
00:04:45,508 --> 00:04:47,343
SUBPOENA TO HIM.

143
00:04:47,343 --> 00:04:51,147
CLINTON OPPOSED A SUBPOENA AND

144
00:04:51,147 --> 00:05:01,290
THEN VOLUNTARILY COMPLIED.

145
00:05:01,290 --> 00:05:04,227
>> Laura: YOUR HOLD PAL ON MSNBC

146
00:05:04,227 --> 00:05:04,527
SAID.

147
00:05:04,527 --> 00:05:06,195
>> THESE FOLKS CAN'T GET THEIR

148
00:05:06,195 --> 00:05:06,729
STORIES STRAIGHT.

149
00:05:06,729 --> 00:05:08,531
THEY CAN'T FIGURE OUT WHAT THEY

150
00:05:08,531 --> 00:05:09,899
WANT TO DO.

151
00:05:09,899 --> 00:05:12,134
THEY SHOULD HAVE TOLD THE TRUTH

152
00:05:12,134 --> 00:05:13,469
A LONG TIME AGO.

153
00:05:13,469 --> 00:05:15,438
MR. GIULIANI HAS BEEN LYING TO

154
00:05:15,438 --> 00:05:16,472
THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ABOUT HOW

155
00:05:16,472 --> 00:05:18,507
THIS OCCURRED AND WHEN IT

156
00:05:18,507 --> 00:05:18,874
OCCURRED.

157
00:05:18,874 --> 00:05:20,376
ACCORDING TO THE DISCLOSURE

158
00:05:20,376 --> 00:05:24,347
TODAY, IT OCCURRED BACK IN 2017.

159
00:05:24,347 --> 00:05:26,115
>> [LAUGHING].

160
00:05:26,115 --> 00:05:27,617
I DON'T THINK I EVER CHANGED

161
00:05:27,617 --> 00:05:28,251
THAT.

162
00:05:28,251 --> 00:05:34,323
THE PAYMENT TOOK PLACE IN 2017.

163
00:05:34,323 --> 00:05:36,125
THE REIMBURSE

164
00:05:36,125 --> 00:05:37,326
THE REIMBURAL

165
00:05:37,326 --> 00:05:37,360
THE REIMBURAL W

166
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:37,827
THE REIMBURAL WAS

167
00:05:37,827 --> 00:05:37,860
THE REIMBURAL WAS 2

168
00:05:37,860 --> 00:05:37,893
THE REIMBURAL WAS 201

169
00:05:37,893 --> 00:05:38,561
THE REIMBURAL WAS 2016

170
00:05:38,561 --> 00:05:38,594
THE REIMBURAL WAS 2016 A

171
00:05:38,594 --> 00:05:38,628
THE REIMBURAL WAS 2016 AND

172
00:05:38,628 --> 00:05:38,661
THE REIMBURAL WAS 2016 AND T

173
00:05:38,661 --> 00:05:38,995
THE REIMBURAL WAS 2016 AND THE

174
00:05:38,995 --> 00:05:39,996
PAYMENT WAS 2017.

175
00:05:39,996 --> 00:05:41,931
HE WAS NOT THERE FOR IT.

176
00:05:41,931 --> 00:05:43,032
I DON'T THINK HE IS A REAL

177
00:05:43,032 --> 00:05:43,633
LAWYER.

178
00:05:43,633 --> 00:05:46,302
HE IS A MAKE BELIEVE LAWYER.

179
00:05:46,302 --> 00:05:48,104
HE HAS ALL KINDS OF LAWSUIT AND

180
00:05:48,104 --> 00:05:50,773
I THINK HE IS TRYING TO BAIL HIM

181
00:05:50,773 --> 00:05:51,040
OUT.

182
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:54,143
I DON'T WANT TO TALK ABOUT HIM.

183
00:05:54,143 --> 00:05:57,013
I WANT TO TALK ABOUT MUELLER.

184
00:05:57,013 --> 00:06:00,216
AVANATI MEANS NOTHING.

185
00:06:00,216 --> 00:06:03,619
>> Laura: YOU ARE NOT WORRIED

186
00:06:03,619 --> 00:06:04,120
ABOUT COHEN?

187
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:06,055
>> NOT A LICK.

188
00:06:06,055 --> 00:06:07,356
IT'S ONLY ABOUT MUELLER GETTING

189
00:06:07,356 --> 00:06:08,791
THE DARN THING OVER WITH.

190
00:06:08,791 --> 00:06:11,294
HE OWES THAT TO THE AMERICAN

191
00:06:11,294 --> 00:06:11,627
PEOPLE.

192
00:06:11,627 --> 00:06:13,596
>> Laura: THE HEAD OF THE LEFT

193
00:06:13,596 --> 00:06:16,165
LEANING ETHICES GROUP, COMMITTEE

194
00:06:16,165 --> 00:06:18,200
FOR RESPONSIBLE ETHICES IN

195
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:19,935
WASHINGTON, SAID, BECAUSE WE

196
00:06:19,935 --> 00:06:20,536
JUST LEARNED ABOUT THIS

197
00:06:20,536 --> 00:06:21,837
LIABILITY RECENTLY, THAT THE

198
00:06:21,837 --> 00:06:23,839
PRESIDENT DISCLOSED, WE WONDER

199
00:06:23,839 --> 00:06:25,741
WHAT OTHER LIABILITIES ARE OUT

200
00:06:25,741 --> 00:06:26,042
THERE.

201
00:06:26,042 --> 00:06:27,910
THEY ISSUED A LONG STATEMENT

202
00:06:27,910 --> 00:06:28,210
TODAY.

203
00:06:28,210 --> 00:06:29,578
THEY FILED THE ACTION THAT LED

204
00:06:29,578 --> 00:06:34,116
TO THE DISCLOSURE OF THE

205
00:06:34,116 --> 00:06:34,517
STATEMENTS.

206
00:06:34,517 --> 00:06:38,087
>> WELL, I DON'T KNOW WHAT HE IS

207
00:06:38,087 --> 00:06:38,921
TALKING ABOUT.

208
00:06:38,921 --> 00:06:41,757
I CAN'T POSSIBLY RESPOND TO ALL

209
00:06:41,757 --> 00:06:43,926
OF THE PRESIDENT'S POLITICAL

210
00:06:43,926 --> 00:06:44,260
ENEMIES.

211
00:06:44,260 --> 00:06:45,461
I IGNORE THEM.

212
00:06:45,461 --> 00:06:48,898
I THINK THEIR STATEMENTS ARE NOT

213
00:06:48,898 --> 00:06:49,899
WORTH ANYTHING.

214
00:06:49,899 --> 00:06:52,335
WHO CARES WHAT THEY SAY?

215
00:06:52,335 --> 00:06:53,569
>> Laura: HOW MANY MEETINGS HAVE

216
00:06:53,569 --> 00:06:55,504
YOU HAD WITH THE MUELLER TEAM?

217
00:06:55,504 --> 00:06:56,439
>> ONE.

218
00:06:56,439 --> 00:07:02,812
WE HAVE FIVE LETTERS WITH THEM.

219
00:07:02,812 --> 00:07:04,580
THREE GOING BACK TO DOWD FOR

220
00:07:04,580 --> 00:07:06,248
THINGS WE NEED TO KNOW.

221
00:07:06,248 --> 00:07:09,352
WE HAD NO RESPONSE FROM THEM.

222
00:07:09,352 --> 00:07:11,087
THEY BASICALLY JUST --

223
00:07:11,087 --> 00:07:12,988
>> Laura: YOU ARE ASKING FOR?

224
00:07:12,988 --> 00:07:15,157
>> WHAT DO THEY REALLY NEED TO

225
00:07:15,157 --> 00:07:15,558
KNOW?

226
00:07:15,558 --> 00:07:20,896
WHAT KIND OF ASSURANCES DO WE

227
00:07:20,896 --> 00:07:22,898
HAVE TO GET IT OVER QUICKLY LIKE

228
00:07:22,898 --> 00:07:24,600
THEY DID FOR CLINTON?

229
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:26,068
I WANTED TO ASK FOR THE HILLARY

230
00:07:26,068 --> 00:07:27,370
CLINTON TREATMENT.

231
00:07:27,370 --> 00:07:29,138
I WANTED THE REPORT 2 WEEKS IN

232
00:07:29,138 --> 00:07:29,872
ADVANCE.

233
00:07:29,872 --> 00:07:31,340
LAUERING LAUERING.

234
00:07:31,340 --> 00:07:32,708
-- [LAUGHING].

235
00:07:32,708 --> 00:07:34,410
CLEARING MY CLIENT.

236
00:07:34,410 --> 00:07:36,178
NO OATHS AND JUST AN INTERVIEW

237
00:07:36,178 --> 00:07:38,948
AND QUESTIONS IN ADVANCE UPON WE

238
00:07:38,948 --> 00:07:40,516
DIDN'T GET HILLARY CLINTON

239
00:07:40,516 --> 00:07:40,950
TREATMENT.

240
00:07:40,950 --> 00:07:44,420
THE PRESIDENT WOULD HAVE BEEN

241
00:07:44,420 --> 00:07:44,820
EMBARRASSED.

242
00:07:44,820 --> 00:07:45,588
>> Laura: THERE IS CONCERN THAT

243
00:07:45,588 --> 00:07:47,323
THE DOJ IS NOT TURNING OVER

244
00:07:47,323 --> 00:07:49,558
DOCUMENTS UNLESS THEY ARE

245
00:07:49,558 --> 00:07:52,128
THREATENED WITH CONTEMPT OF

246
00:07:52,128 --> 00:07:52,495
CONGRESS.

247
00:07:52,495 --> 00:07:55,564
NUNES MALIGNED BY THE LIBERAL

248
00:07:55,564 --> 00:07:56,465
MEDIA.

249
00:07:56,465 --> 00:07:58,868
CRITICIZED FOR NOT READING SOME

250
00:07:58,868 --> 00:07:59,301
DOCUMENTS.

251
00:07:59,301 --> 00:08:02,538
WHAT IS YOUR SENSE, GIVEN YOUR

252
00:08:02,538 --> 00:08:05,775
BACKGROUND AS A U.S. ATTORNEY,

253
00:08:05,775 --> 00:08:09,178
WHAT IS GOING ON?

254
00:08:09,178 --> 00:08:12,314
>> THE ATTORNEY GENERAL HAS THE

255
00:08:12,314 --> 00:08:14,650
ROLE THAT ROSENSTEIN HAS NOW.

256
00:08:14,650 --> 00:08:16,552
I CAN'T IMAGINE NOT COMPLYING

257
00:08:16,552 --> 00:08:19,555
WITH A REQUEST FOR SUCH

258
00:08:19,555 --> 00:08:20,356
SENSITIVE DOCUMENTS WITH

259
00:08:20,356 --> 00:08:20,723
CONGRESS.

260
00:08:20,723 --> 00:08:23,759
THEY WON'T GIVE UP THE

261
00:08:23,759 --> 00:08:26,495
AUTHORIZATION TO PROCEED AGAINST

262
00:08:26,495 --> 00:08:29,598
MANAFORT OR AGAINST COHEN.

263
00:08:29,598 --> 00:08:31,300
WHY?

264
00:08:31,300 --> 00:08:33,635
JUDGE ELLIS LAID INTO THEM

265
00:08:33,635 --> 00:08:34,403
PRETTY HARD.

266
00:08:34,403 --> 00:08:36,172
WE WERE HAVING A PRETTY GOOD

267
00:08:36,172 --> 00:08:37,539
DIALOGUE WITH THEM.

268
00:08:37,539 --> 00:08:40,009
I THINK THEY ARE SHELL SHOCKED.

269
00:08:40,009 --> 00:08:41,677
THEY ARE THE DARLINGS OF THE

270
00:08:41,677 --> 00:08:41,977
MEDIA.

271
00:08:41,977 --> 00:08:48,017
ALL OF A SUDDEN THEIR INTEGRITY

272
00:08:48,017 --> 00:08:49,351
IS IN QUESTION ABOUT THE TACTICS

273
00:08:49,351 --> 00:08:51,086
THEY USED.

274
00:08:51,086 --> 00:08:53,355
INDICTING MANAFORT.

275
00:08:53,355 --> 00:08:53,656
2005?

276
00:08:53,656 --> 00:08:54,657
THE PRESIDENT DIDN'T KNOW

277
00:08:54,657 --> 00:08:56,058
MANAFORT IN 2005.

278
00:08:56,058 --> 00:09:00,963
IF HE DID, THERE WAS NO

279
00:09:00,963 --> 00:09:02,631
MEANINGFUL RELATIONSHIP.

280
00:09:02,631 --> 00:09:04,900
>> Laura: THE STORY BROKEN BY

281
00:09:04,900 --> 00:09:07,770
THE RUSSIAN OLIGARCH VISITED BY

282
00:09:07,770 --> 00:09:10,139
THE FBI IN NEW YORK.

283
00:09:10,139 --> 00:09:15,511
HE IS ON THE SANCTIONS LIST.

284
00:09:15,511 --> 00:09:16,879
VISITED BY THE FBI.

285
00:09:16,879 --> 00:09:18,714
THEY SAID WE HAVE THIS IDEA THAT

286
00:09:18,714 --> 00:09:22,218
PAUL MANAFORT WAS COLLUDING WITH

287
00:09:22,218 --> 00:09:25,321
THE RUSSIANS FOR THE TRUMP

288
00:09:25,321 --> 00:09:27,089
CAMPAIGN.

289
00:09:27,089 --> 00:09:30,926
DO YOU WANT TO HELP US?

290
00:09:30,926 --> 00:09:32,962
AND A PERSON WHO CAN'T STAND

291
00:09:32,962 --> 00:09:36,165
MANAFORT SAID I CAN'T LIKE THIS

292
00:09:36,165 --> 00:09:36,866
GUY.

293
00:09:36,866 --> 00:09:38,567
THE IDEA THAT MANAFORT IS

294
00:09:38,567 --> 00:09:39,268
COLLUDING, HE LAW ENFORCEMENT

295
00:09:39,268 --> 00:09:42,605
OFFICERS THEM OUT OF THE ROOM.

296
00:09:42,605 --> 00:09:54,149
IT DOESN'T LOOK WAS DISCLOSED.UG

297
00:09:54,149 --> 00:09:54,183

THE ROOM.

305
00:09:54,950 --> 00:09:58,087
IT DOESN'T LOOK WAS DISCLOSED.

306
00:09:58,087 --> 00:10:01,357
>> IF WE WALKED INTO A HEARING

307
00:10:01,357 --> 00:10:02,491
WITH THEM, I DON'T KNOW WHAT

308
00:10:02,491 --> 00:10:04,026
THEY WOULD NOT TELL US.

309
00:10:04,026 --> 00:10:11,333
I KNOW THEY HAVE PLENTY -- IT'S

310
00:10:11,333 --> 00:10:12,935
ABOUT TIME TO GET THE DARN THING

311
00:10:12,935 --> 00:10:14,003
OVER WITH.

312
00:10:14,003 --> 00:10:14,703
SAY ENOUGH.

313
00:10:14,703 --> 00:10:16,171
WE TORTURED THIS PRESIDENT

314
00:10:16,171 --> 00:10:17,806
ENOUGH.

315
00:10:17,806 --> 00:10:19,241
MEANWHILE, LOOK AT WHAT HE

316
00:10:19,241 --> 00:10:21,110
ACCOMPLISHED WITH ALL OF THIS ON

317
00:10:21,110 --> 00:10:21,810
HIS BACK.

318
00:10:21,810 --> 00:10:25,648
IT'S LIKE A BIG WEIGHT ON HIS

319
00:10:25,648 --> 00:10:35,724
BACK.

320
00:10:37,259 --> 00:10:37,393
BACK.

321
00:10:37,393 --> 00:10:38,794
KOREA AND CHINA.

322
00:10:38,794 --> 00:10:39,562
>> Laura: MICHAEL SAID THIS.

323
00:10:39,562 --> 00:10:42,965
>> IF THERE IS A CONFLICT OF

324
00:10:42,965 --> 00:10:44,567
INTEREST, IT WOULD JEOPARDIZE

325
00:10:44,567 --> 00:10:45,200
THE INVESTIGATION.

326
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:45,668
>> THAT'S RIGHT.

327
00:10:45,668 --> 00:10:49,171
WHAT ABOUT PLACING A SPY IN THE

328
00:10:49,171 --> 00:10:50,839
TRUMP CAMPAIGN.

329
00:10:50,839 --> 00:10:51,874
>> Laura: DO YOU BELIEVE

330
00:10:51,874 --> 00:10:52,241
HAPPENED?

331
00:10:52,241 --> 00:10:53,142
>> I DON'T KNOW.

332
00:10:53,142 --> 00:10:54,777
>> Laura: DOES THE PRESIDENT

333
00:10:54,777 --> 00:10:55,377
BELIEVE THAT HAPPENED?

334
00:10:55,377 --> 00:10:56,178
>> I DON'T THINK WE WANT TO

335
00:10:56,178 --> 00:10:56,912
BELIEVE IT OR NOT.

336
00:10:56,912 --> 00:11:00,349
PEOPLE WHO BREAK INTO MANAFORT'S

337
00:11:00,349 --> 00:11:02,818
HOME IN THE MORNING IN A WHITE

338
00:11:02,818 --> 00:11:04,320
COLLAR CASE WHEN HE WAS

339
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:07,056
PRODUCING DOCUMENTS WHO BREAK

340
00:11:07,056 --> 00:11:09,124
INTO COHEN'S LAW OFFICE.

341
00:11:09,124 --> 00:11:09,892
A LAW OFFICE.

342
00:11:09,892 --> 00:11:12,861
I NEVER DID THAT AND I WAS AN

343
00:11:12,861 --> 00:11:14,263
AGGRESSIVE PROSECUTOR.

344
00:11:14,263 --> 00:11:17,299
I NEVER HAD THE BENEFIT OF AN

345
00:11:17,299 --> 00:11:19,201
INTERVIEW TO DECIDE WHETHER TO

346
00:11:19,201 --> 00:11:20,235
PROSECUTE OR NOT.

347
00:11:20,235 --> 00:11:21,804
I DIDN'T NEED IT.

348
00:11:21,804 --> 00:11:24,573
THESE GUYS ARE GOING BEYOND WHAT

349
00:11:24,573 --> 00:00:00,000
IS NORMALLY DONE.
