1
00:00:02,965 --> 00:00:06,228
THE SANCTIONS IN NORTH KOREA

2
00:00:06,228 --> 00:00:08,650
ABIDED BY, OPENED NEW

3
00:00:08,650 --> 00:00:09,053
POSSIBILITIES.

4
00:00:09,053 --> 00:00:10,561
>> Dana: GERMAN CHANCELLOR

5
00:00:10,561 --> 00:00:12,808
MERKEL MOMENTS AGO GIVING

6
00:00:12,808 --> 00:00:13,709
PRESIDENT TRUMP SOME PROPS ON

7
00:00:13,709 --> 00:00:14,460
NORTH KOREA.

8
00:00:14,460 --> 00:00:16,158
JOINING ME IS MICHAEL ALLEN.

9
00:00:16,158 --> 00:00:17,759
HE'S A FORMER MEMBER OF THE

10
00:00:17,759 --> 00:00:19,166
NATIONAL SECURITY COUNCIL.

11
00:00:19,166 --> 00:00:21,017
THIS DOES FEEL LIKE KIND OF A

12
00:00:21,017 --> 00:00:21,663
MOMENTOUS DAY.

13
00:00:21,663 --> 00:00:23,271
I JUST HAD A TWEET FROM SOMEONE

14
00:00:23,271 --> 00:00:25,067
TELLING ME HIS FATHER WAS IN

15
00:00:25,067 --> 00:00:25,367
KOREA.

16
00:00:25,367 --> 00:00:26,673
HE WAS STATIONED IN KOREA.

17
00:00:26,673 --> 00:00:28,825
HIS SON IS STATIONED IN KOREA.

18
00:00:28,825 --> 00:00:30,777
AND TODAY FEELS LIKE A DAY,

19
00:00:30,777 --> 00:00:32,975
THOUGH OF COURSE AS ARI FLEISHER

20
00:00:32,975 --> 00:00:34,252
SAID, THOUGH THERE IS REASON TO

21
00:00:34,252 --> 00:00:35,332
BE CAUTIOUS.

22
00:00:35,332 --> 00:00:36,634
>> THAT'S EXACTLY RIGHT HERE.

23
00:00:36,634 --> 00:00:37,535
I THINK PRESIDENT TRUMP IS

24
00:00:37,535 --> 00:00:39,186
PROBABLY RIGHT TO TRY AND TEST

25
00:00:39,186 --> 00:00:41,538
THE INTENTIONS OF THE NEW

26
00:00:41,538 --> 00:00:42,084
LEADER.

27
00:00:42,084 --> 00:00:44,893
IT MAY BE THAT HE SEES THE WAY

28
00:00:44,893 --> 00:00:47,017
FORWARD IN THE FUTURE FOR THE

29
00:00:47,017 --> 00:00:48,018
NORTH KOREAN ECONOMY.

30
00:00:48,018 --> 00:00:49,091
IT'S TANKING.

31
00:00:49,091 --> 00:00:50,192
IT'S TERRIBLE.

32
00:00:50,192 --> 00:00:52,494
IT'S ONLY GOING TO GET WORSE.

33
00:00:52,494 --> 00:00:54,150
IT PROBABLY MAKES SENSE, WHILE

34
00:00:54,150 --> 00:00:56,403
NOT TAKING ANY OF YOUR CRIPPLING

35
00:00:56,403 --> 00:00:58,255
SANCTIONS OFF THE TABLE, TO SORT

36
00:00:58,255 --> 00:01:00,957
OF TEST THE WATERS HERE AND SEE

37
00:01:00,957 --> 00:01:02,404
IF THIS GUY CAN MAKE GOOD ON

38
00:01:02,404 --> 00:01:03,884
WHAT HE'S SAYING.

39
00:01:03,884 --> 00:01:04,907
>> Dana: IN ADDITION, THERE WAS

40
00:01:04,907 --> 00:01:06,636
A LOT OF TALK ABOUT IRAN THIS

41
00:01:06,636 --> 00:01:08,464
WEEK AND THE IRAN DEAL.

42
00:01:08,464 --> 00:01:11,613
I WONDER WHAT YOU THOUGHT ANGELA

43
00:01:11,613 --> 00:01:13,115
MERKEL NEEDED TO GET OUT OF THIS

44
00:01:13,115 --> 00:01:14,616
MEETING WHEN IT CAME TO IRAN AND

45
00:01:14,616 --> 00:01:16,624
WAS SHE ABLE TO GO HOME WITH

46
00:01:16,624 --> 00:01:17,019
ANYTHING?

47
00:01:17,019 --> 00:01:18,442
>> DOESN'T SOUND LIKE TOO MUCH.

48
00:01:18,442 --> 00:01:19,944
SOUNDS LIKE THE PRESIDENT IS

49
00:01:19,944 --> 00:01:21,323
OPEN TO HEARING WHAT THE

50
00:01:21,323 --> 00:01:23,480
EUROPEAN POWERS HAVE TO SAY.

51
00:01:23,480 --> 00:01:26,335
BUT LISTEN, WE STILL NEED THREE

52
00:01:26,335 --> 00:01:28,237
THINGS IN ORDER TO STAY IN THIS

53
00:01:28,237 --> 00:01:28,630
DEAL.

54
00:01:28,630 --> 00:01:30,539
THE MOST IMPORTANT OF WHICH IS,

55
00:01:30,539 --> 00:01:33,992
WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO PUT A

56
00:01:33,992 --> 00:01:37,443
LONGER PERIOD TO THIS DEAL.

57
00:01:37,443 --> 00:01:40,042
WE DON'T NEED SUN SEATS HERE IN

58
00:01:40,042 --> 00:01:42,952
THE NEXT 5, 12 YEARS, THAT'S THE

59
00:01:42,952 --> 00:01:44,246
STRATEGIC PATIENCE PATH WAY.

60
00:01:44,246 --> 00:01:46,353
THE EUROPEANS NEED TO UNITE WITH

61
00:01:46,353 --> 00:01:47,654
US AND TRY TO IMPROVE THE DEAL

62
00:01:47,654 --> 00:01:49,330
SO WE MIGHT STAY IN.

63
00:01:49,330 --> 00:01:50,506
>> Dana: LET ME ALSO ASK YOU

64
00:01:50,506 --> 00:01:53,009
ABOUT -- READ TO YOU FROM "THE

65
00:01:53,009 --> 00:01:54,556
WALL STREET JOURNAL" THIS

66
00:01:54,556 --> 00:01:57,135
MORNING, SAYING ON THE EVE OF A

67
00:01:57,135 --> 00:01:59,761
TRUMP/KIM JONG-UN SUMMIT, A

68
00:01:59,761 --> 00:02:01,863
REWRITE WOULD REINFORCE

69
00:02:01,863 --> 00:02:04,392
MR. TRUMP'S DEMAND THAT NORTH

70
00:02:04,392 --> 00:02:07,170
KOREA MUST DISMANTLE ITS NUCLEAR

71
00:02:07,170 --> 00:02:15,783
AMBITIONS.

72
00:02:15,783 --> 00:02:17,834
MICHAEL, I JUST ASSUME THAT IF

73
00:02:17,834 --> 00:02:19,481
GERMANY AND OTHERS IN EUROPE

74
00:02:19,481 --> 00:02:20,882
HAVE TO MAKE A CHOICE BETWEEN

75
00:02:20,882 --> 00:02:22,790
DOING BUSINESS WITH IRAN OR

76
00:02:22,790 --> 00:02:23,791
BUSINESS WITH THE UNITED STATES,

77
00:02:23,791 --> 00:02:24,987
THERE'S JUST NO QUESTION WHAT

78
00:02:24,987 --> 00:02:26,169
THEY WOULD CHOOSE.

79
00:02:26,169 --> 00:02:27,593
SO THE PRESIDENT'S HAND HERE

80
00:02:27,593 --> 00:02:28,945
FEELS PRETTY STRONG.

81
00:02:28,945 --> 00:02:30,399
>> I THINK SO.

82
00:02:30,399 --> 00:02:30,792
LISTEN.

83
00:02:30,792 --> 00:02:32,799
LOT OF THE PRESIDENT'S LANGUAGE

84
00:02:32,799 --> 00:02:34,601
IS CALCULATED TO MAKING IT CLEAR

85
00:02:34,601 --> 00:02:37,203
TO THEM THAT HE'S VERY, VERY

86
00:02:37,203 --> 00:02:37,555
SERIOUS.

87
00:02:37,555 --> 00:02:38,900
I THINK THAT'S WHAT'S GOTTEN

88
00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:40,402
THEM TO THE TABLE SO FAR IN

89
00:02:40,402 --> 00:02:42,504
ORDER TO SAY, HEY, LISTEN, LET'S

90
00:02:42,504 --> 00:02:44,286
TRY AND FIX SOME OF THESE THINGS

91
00:02:44,286 --> 00:02:45,813
THAT OBAMA NEGOTIATED.

92
00:02:45,813 --> 00:02:47,409
BUT, YOU KNOW, I THINK THEY GOT

93
00:02:47,409 --> 00:02:48,710
A PRETTY STRONG MESSAGE.

94
00:02:48,710 --> 00:02:51,117
PRESIDENT MACRON AND CHANCELLOR

95
00:02:51,117 --> 00:02:52,118
MERKEL THIS WEEK.

96
00:02:52,118 --> 00:02:53,293
LISTEN, THE PRESIDENT IS

97
00:02:53,293 --> 00:02:53,615
SERIOUS.

98
00:02:53,615 --> 00:02:55,217
HE'S GOT TO GET A BETTER DEAL OR

99
00:02:55,217 --> 00:02:56,899
HE DOESN'T WANT TO STAY IN THE

100
00:02:56,899 --> 00:02:58,574
DEAL FOR A LOT OF REASONS ABOUT

101
00:02:58,574 --> 00:02:59,775
THE MIDDLE EAST, BUT ALSO FOR

102
00:02:59,775 --> 00:03:01,677
THE MESSAGE IT SENDS TO NORTH

103
00:03:01,677 --> 00:03:03,429
KOREA, WHICH IS THAT WE'RE

104
00:03:03,429 --> 00:03:05,927
WILLING TO SIGN UP FOR DEALS

105
00:03:05,927 --> 00:03:07,233
THAT WE THINK HAVE SERIOUS

106
00:03:07,233 --> 00:03:07,659
EMERGENCIES.

107
00:03:07,659 --> 00:03:09,585
>> Dana: WHAT ABOUT THE TRADE

108
00:03:09,585 --> 00:03:09,936
ISSUE?

109
00:03:09,936 --> 00:03:11,633
I HAVE ONLY GOT ABOUT 40 SECONDS

110
00:03:11,633 --> 00:03:13,165
LEFT, BUT I'LL LET YOU HAVE THE

111
00:03:13,165 --> 00:03:14,741
FLOOR HERE TO TALK ABOUT THE

112
00:03:14,741 --> 00:03:16,392
TRADE ISSUES THAT GERMANY IS

113
00:03:16,392 --> 00:03:17,393
CONCERNED ABOUT AND HOW YOU

114
00:03:17,393 --> 00:03:18,895
THINK THAT WILL PLAY OUT WITH

115
00:03:18,895 --> 00:03:20,642
THE DEADLINE MAY 1ST NEXT WEEK.

116
00:03:20,642 --> 00:03:22,244
>> I THINK THE PRESIDENT WILL

117
00:03:22,244 --> 00:03:24,046
END UP EXTENDING THE SORT OF

118
00:03:24,046 --> 00:03:26,048
SHELTER HE'S GIVEN THEM TO GIVE

119
00:03:26,048 --> 00:03:28,254
THE TWO SIDES MORE TIME TO

120
00:03:28,254 --> 00:03:28,650
NEGOTIATE.

121
00:03:28,650 --> 00:03:30,656
I DON'T KNOW THAT IT MAKES TOTAL

122
00:03:30,656 --> 00:03:34,210
SENSE TO SORT OF SANCTION THEM

123
00:03:34,210 --> 00:03:34,965
AT THE SAME TIME THAT WE NEED

124
00:03:34,965 --> 00:00:00,000
THEM ON IRAN.
