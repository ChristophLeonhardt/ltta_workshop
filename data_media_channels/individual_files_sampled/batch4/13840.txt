Hilary Clinton says that half of Donald Trump supporters could be put in a basket of deplorable the Democrat candidate for soulless president was speaking at a fundraiser when in the midst of delivering a package of unbelievables to a roomful of gullible she dumped the cesspool of despicable zhan to a crowd of unobjectionable rushing behind a curtain to keep the news media's Volkswagon of laughable x' from catching her on camera hacking up a gob of in de Geste Buhl's the woman who once exposed the phone load of classifiable x' to a world of executables with an agenda of disagreeable revealed herself to have a heart of uncharitable toward a nation of unexceptionable hillary later released a hypocrisy of culpable x' for her passel of regrettable x' but she had already left a stain of unfavorables on a reputation of crappy nastiness hillary accused trump supporters of being racist sexist homophobic xenophobic and Islamophobic thereby proving herself a classist narcissist anthropophaga Kandra phobic pana phobe with a vocabulary limited to important sounding insults rendered largely meaningless by repeatedly being used only to silence and demonize opinions differing from her own in other words she's a Democrat the controversy over Hillary's insult to millions of Americans temporarily obscured the controversy over her corrupt use of a private email server which had previously led to the controversy of her continuous dishonesty which was then temporarily replaced by the controversy over her elf the health controversy gained new strength over the weekend when she began behaving strangely at a 9/11 memorial in New York and then grew weak and then collapsed and then mysteriously disappeared from mainstream news coverage this left many observers wondering if the candidate had come down with Vanishing syndrome an increasingly common disease that causes leftist to become invisible to journalists when doing something that could cost them votes doctors say vanishing syndrome is a serious malady which has already affected many at the Justice Department and Internal Revenue Service the only cure for this disease is media integrity a medicine which must be manufactured by a complex an expensive process which involves dipping New York Times editors in tar covering them in feathers then tying them to a rail and carrying them down to the Hudson River after which they must be inserted in to the water and pelted with rotten vegetables while they are carried out into New York Harbor and then to see here's hoping the medicine can be manufactured soon and in large quantities in order to make the ailing mrs. Clinton visible to journalists once again meanwhile to prove that the health emergency was only a harmless fainting spell or heart attack or stroke and nothing that would keep mrs. Clinton from performing the duties of the President as long as she's held up by a man on each arm who pretends she's still alive mrs.

Clinton's health and the transparency of her campaign squarely into the last two months of the race which many polls show has grown tighter so the episode thrust that it's not all of us who've been questioning this all of us who've been looking with our own eyes and seeing this say they go on to say for months Republicans have with scarce evidence question the stamina of mrs. Clinton 68 and claims she is ill often pointing to her repeated coughing bouts so I mean this is this is so typical you know I mean the right conservatives who are true constitutional conservatives are almost always right about everything I mean seriously I I'm serious their their attitudes toward poverty work their attitudes toward crime work their attitudes toward the free market work everything they do works and when it turns out they work nobody ever says Oh conservatives were right you know nobody ever says that oh we did Detroit destroy Detroit we did this Chicago maybe we shouldn't have done that maybe better policing would have helped nobody ever says that it's oh we are always on the outside screaming and we're always conspiracy theorists Nina you know cheryl atkinson a real reporter we know she was a real reporter because CBS forced her out for trying to cover the obama administration she tried to cover benghazi tried to cover the IRS scandal they would not run her stories I mean she's a great investigative reporter who covered george w bush just as hard as she covered Obama but with Obama they just stopped playing her stories she says the incident raises questions about the news media's coverage surrounding Clinton's health rather than reporting the facts many in the media have taken it upon themselves to shout down the questions and to controversial eyes those asking them on August 21 2016 after Trump advisor Rudy Giuliani suggested people research Clinton's medical State on Google a New York Times tech columnist reported in a tweet Google should fix this it shouldn't give quarter to conspiracy theories this is this is a tweet from a New York Times tech reporter in other words the columnist was advocating that a conspiracy be committed to stop people from researching Clinton's health which he labeled a conspiracy many others in the media also chimed in using the conspiracy theory moniker it's designed to convince the public to tune out the discussion in much the same way as other common astroturf terms such as debunked bonkers tinfoil hat shoddy discredited quack bogus denier and crank and and she just goes on to list all the people on the left and and not just on the left NBC News calls it you know a we were mainstreaming conspiracy theories about Hillary Clinton's health okay so oh the fact is we were right something is wrong with her now they're saying it's pneumonia pneumonia comes and goes but pneumonia is also a secondary infection a lot of times you get sick and then pneumonia is what carries you off but you're already been weakened by something else so it's very hard to know what exactly is going on because they lie all the time and one more important point about this Donald Trump did not say anything stupid and I think that's it is worth noting in all seriousness it's worth noting because before 9/11 before any of this happened I was taking bets on whether he could get through 9/11 leaving this up without saying something utterly ridiculous and without saying something that it was make you cringe and not only did here in this thing that sprung up this emergency that came out of nowhere he wished her well he said I hope she's back on the campaign trail soon and he made no comment he handled himself very well and that that indicates something that he has learned something he is not the candidate I don't think this ain't this guy four or five weeks ago would have been quite as on top of it as he was now so I just want to point out this way there's an article by Heather McDonald our friend Heather Mack from the from City Journal and the Manhattan Institute who's been just following black lives matter and exposing all the lies they tell and exposing all the terrible results and she's talking abut she writes a piece about Chicago and the fact that 92 people I'm still on this side this is still on the subject of Clinton's health but just a digression for a minute 92 people were shot dead in Chicago in the month of August okay this is a tragedy unfolding in one of our greatest cities you know Chicago is one of the great cities of the world let alone our country and because of black lives matter and because of Democrat corrupt Democrat governance people are being gunned down and and guys you know these are children these are children on the street these are guys raking their the leaves on their lawn they're being blown away I mean ten year olds doing their homework kids playing on the street gangsters are blowing them away in the city and one of the reasons is because black lives matter has ginned up so much hostility to the police the police aren't showing up there are three gangs in Chicago who have sworn a pact to kill police officers so the police are pulling back and this is so at the end of this article she says Heather McDonald says the ideal solution to Chicago violence would be for more at-risk boys to be raised by their mother and father until that happens the only hope for law-abiding residents of Chicago's high crime areas is that police regain control of the streets now whenever you talk about this stuff people say well you don't understand what it's like to be black in America and that is true I do not understand viscerally what it's like to be black in America what I do understand is what it's like to be human everywhere and for human beings it is a universal rule if you blame others for all your problems if you wait around for the world to work well your way around for the world to be fair before you get on your horse and do what needs to be done if you don't self examine and self correct not changes in your life and this is true for everybody so the press now when something like this happens if the media had us a drop of honest blood in its veins if the New York Times were not a former newspaper but still a newspaper doing the job it used to do in the seventies and sixties they would be saying maybe we got this wrong they would be questioning themselves they would be asking did we do something wrong and and you know the same thing is true of the Democrats this is what makes Hillary's speech that she made on Friday to a bunch of donors which he insulted all of trumps people this is what made this so appalling let's let's hear what she said at this you know to just be grossly generalistic you could put half of trumps supporters into what I call the basket of deplorable zz right the racist sexist homophobic xenophobic Islamophobic you name it and unfortunately there are people like that and he has lifted them up okay a little later we're gonna bring on our cultural reporter Michael Knowles reporting from the writers room to talk about some of the actual deplorable zhan the Trump side but this is not what the Trump movement is about I mean regardless of what you think of Trump whether you think he's the savior I have to stop here and just say goodbye to our friends on Facebook and YouTube if you were subscribing you could have watched the whole thing on The Daily wire but come over anyway and hear the rest of the show
