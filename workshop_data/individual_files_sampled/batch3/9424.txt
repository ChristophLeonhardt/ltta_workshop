Tucker: THE DEPUTY ATTORNEY GENERAL ROD ROSENSTEIN AND FBI DIRECTOR CHRISTOPHER WRAY UPHELD APPEARED ON C WRAY UPHELD APPEARED ON P WRAY UPHELD APPEARED ON T WRAY UPHELD APPEARED ON L WRAY UPHELD APPEARED ON H WRAY UPHELD APPEARED ON L DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE OF HIDING INFORMATION FROM CONGRESS. HERE'S PART OF THE EXCHANGE. IF YOU HAVE EVIDENCE THAT THIS PRESIDENT ACTED INAPPROPRIATELY, PRESENTED TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. THERE'S AN OLD SAYING THAT JUSTICE DELAYED IS JUSTICE DENIED. I THINK RIGHT NOW ALL OF US ARE BEING DENIED. WHATEVER YOU'VE GOT, FINISH IT TORN APART. WITH REGARD TO THE INVESTIGATION, I HAVE HEARD SUGGESTIONS THAT WE SHOULD JUST CLOSE THE INVESTIGATION. I THINK THE BEST THING WE CAN DO IS FINISH IT APPROPRIATELY AND REACH A CONCLUSION. Tucker: TOM FITTON IS THE PRESIDENT OF JUDICIAL WATCH AND HE JOINS US TONIGHT. TOM, WHEN IS THIS GOING TO WRAP UP, DO WE HAVE ANY SENSE OF AN THERE IS NO IMMINENT END DATE. THIS OBSTRUCTION INVESTIGATION AND THEN YOU HAVE THE RUSSIAN COLLISION INVESTIGATION. WE KNOW THERE HAS BEEN NO RUSH IN COLLUSION WITH PRESIDENT TRUMP, SO I DON'T KNOW WHAT MUELLER IS DOING. HE HASN'T PRESENTED ANY INFORMATION ABOUT WHERE HE IS IN HIS INVESTIGATION. RANKLY, HE SHOULD BE ON THE HILL TESTIFYING SINCE HE SEEMS TO BE THE ONE RUNNING THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT AND THE FBI ON THIS IMPORTANT MATTER. Tucker: SO HOW DID THEY RESPOND, UNDER THESE QUESTIONS? THEY SEEM, I THINK, OBLIVIOUS TO THE CONCERNS AMERICANS HAVE ABOUT THE CREDIBILITY AND LEADERSHIP OF THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT AND THE FBI. OBVIOUSLY UNDER THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION IT WAS AN ABSOLUTE DISASTER. DOESN'T TRUST THEM TO TURN OVER THE DOCUMENTS I HAVE AND IT CERTAINLY, THE DIRECTOR DOESN'T SEEM TO THINK THE IG REPORT WAS ABOUT THE FBI. HE KEEPS THINKING THAT IT WASN'T ABOUT THE INSTITUTION OF THE FBI WAS A LEADERSHIP OF THE FBI THAT MR. ROSENSTEIN HAS PRODUCED BY WITH SUBPOENAS IN A TIMELY WAY AND HE DOESN'T HAVE ANY EXCUSES AS TO WHY IT TAKES YEARS AND MONTHS TO TURN OVER A BASIC TEXT PRESSED ON, HE SAID I HAVE A LOT OF PEOPLE WORKING ON IT VERY HARD AND IF THEY MISS IT OR THERE ARE MISTAKES THAT ARE MADE I WOULD GO BACK AND SHARE THEIR CONCERNS WITH THEM. IT DOESN'T SOUND VERY SATISFYING TO ANYONE WHO IS TRYING TO GET A GENERATION.
