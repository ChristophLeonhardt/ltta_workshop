00:00:16,376 --> 00:00:18,912
COUNSEL TO THE PRESIDENT

4
00:00:18,912 --> 00:00:19,779
KELLYANNE CONWAY WITH US.

5
00:00:19,779 --> 00:00:22,482
I WANT TO GET TO THE EAGLES.

6
00:00:22,482 --> 00:00:26,286
THE ATTACKS ON THE FIRST LADY.

7
00:00:26,286 --> 00:00:29,055
YOU AND IVANKA HAVE GONE THROUGH

8
00:00:29,055 --> 00:00:30,023
IT.

9
00:00:30,023 --> 00:00:31,157
WHERE IS ALL OF THIS LIBERAL

10
00:00:31,157 --> 00:00:33,193
RESPECT FOR WOMEN?

11
00:00:33,193 --> 00:00:34,594
THE FIRST LADY PUTS OUT

12
00:00:34,594 --> 00:00:35,962
STATEMENTS I AM RECOVERING.

13
00:00:35,962 --> 00:00:38,231
I JUST HAD SURGERY AND I WAS

14
00:00:38,231 --> 00:00:38,998
SEEN IN PUBLIC YESTERDAY.

15
00:00:38,998 --> 00:00:42,769
>> WE NEED TO REVISIT THE EQUAL

16
00:00:42,769 --> 00:00:45,905
RIGHTS AMENDMENT AND GET THAT

17
00:00:45,905 --> 00:00:48,374
RATIFIED FROM ITS FAILED

18
00:00:48,374 --> 00:00:50,043
ATTEMPTS 40 YEARS AGO.

19
00:00:50,043 --> 00:00:52,979
JUST STARTING TO RESPECT EACH

20
00:00:52,979 --> 00:00:54,747
OTHER REGARDLESS OF POLITICS AND

21
00:00:54,747 --> 00:00:55,114
POSITION.

22
00:00:55,114 --> 00:00:57,917
I WANT TO SAY A COUPLE OF THINGS

23
00:00:57,917 --> 00:01:00,653
AND TAKE IT AWAY FROM ME AND

24
00:01:00,653 --> 00:01:03,022
OTHERS AND BACK TO THE FIRST

25
00:01:03,022 --> 00:01:03,323
LADY.

26
00:01:03,323 --> 00:01:05,592
I WORK CLOSELY WITH HER AND

27
00:01:05,592 --> 00:01:07,760
RESPECT HER ENORMOUSLY.

28
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:11,264
THIS COUNTRY IS BLESSED BECAUSE

29
00:01:11,264 --> 00:01:12,532
SHE IS OUR FIRST LADY.

30
00:01:12,532 --> 00:01:16,369
I SPEAK ONE LANGUAGE, ABOUT FIVE

31
00:01:16,369 --> 00:01:18,371
LESS THAN SHE SPEAKS.

32
00:01:18,371 --> 00:01:22,275
SHE ACCOMPANIES HER HUSBAND ALL

33
00:01:22,275 --> 00:01:23,142
OVER THE NATION.

34
00:01:23,142 --> 00:01:26,479
I WOULD TELL THE CRITICS TO LOOK

35
00:01:26,479 --> 00:01:27,747
AT HER PLATFORM FOR THE

36
00:01:27,747 --> 00:01:28,915
SOLUTIONS IN THIS NATION.

37
00:01:28,915 --> 00:01:31,050
SHE TALKS ABOUT KINDNESS AND

38
00:01:31,050 --> 00:01:33,553
RESPECT AND THE SOCIAL AND

39
00:01:33,553 --> 00:01:34,721
EMOTIONAL WILL BEING OF

40
00:01:34,721 --> 00:01:35,088
CHILDREN.

41
00:01:35,088 --> 00:01:37,891
SHE IS TRYING TO HELP CHILDREN

42
00:01:37,891 --> 00:01:39,893
WHO FEEL THEY NEED ASSISTANCE.

43
00:01:39,893 --> 00:01:41,494
THAT THEY FEEL LIKE THEY ARE

44
00:01:41,494 --> 00:01:43,129
BEING BULLIED AT SCHOOL PERHAPS

45
00:01:43,129 --> 00:01:44,697
OR ADDICTED TO DRUGS.

46
00:01:44,697 --> 00:01:46,266
I TRAVEL WITH THE FIRST LADY AND

47
00:01:46,266 --> 00:01:47,834
WATCHED HER HOLD THOSE BABIES

48
00:01:47,834 --> 00:01:53,406
WHO WERE BORN ADDICTED AND

49
00:01:53,406 --> 00:01:55,275
STRUGGLING BECAUSE THEY WERE 1

50
00:01:55,275 --> 00:01:59,212
OF 100 BABIES BORN EVERY DAY.

51
00:01:59,212 --> 00:02:00,914
>> Sean: THE WAY THEY HAVE

52
00:02:00,914 --> 00:02:04,884
TREATED HER IS SO OVER THE TOP

53
00:02:04,884 --> 00:02:05,652
AWFUL.

54
00:02:05,652 --> 00:02:07,053
WORDS CAN'T EVEN DESCRIBE IT.

55
00:02:07,053 --> 00:02:10,289
>> I DON'T LIKE DIGNIFYING IT BY

56
00:02:10,289 --> 00:02:10,889
DISCUSSING IT.

57
00:02:10,889 --> 00:02:14,394
SHE IS SO MUCH STRONGER THAN

58
00:02:14,394 --> 00:02:14,694
THAT.

59
00:02:14,694 --> 00:02:15,495
>> Sean: SHE IS.

60
00:02:15,495 --> 00:02:18,831

61
00:02:18,831 --> 00:02:19,198

>> Sean: SHE IS A GREAT PERSON.

63
00:02:20,066 --> 00:02:21,935

SHE IS HONORING GOLD STAR

66
00:02:26,306 --> 00:02:28,775
FAMILIES AND PEOPLE ARE PEDDLING

67
00:02:28,775 --> 00:02:30,009
CONSPIRACY THEORIES THAT SHOULD

68
00:02:30,009 --> 00:02:32,178

PLATFORM.

81
00:02:38,685 --> 00:02:40,053
>> Sean: IN THE NFL YOU CAN'T

82
00:02:40,053 --> 00:02:42,188
TAUNT OTHER PLAYERS AND DO

83
00:02:42,188 --> 00:02:44,290
CERTAIN DANCES AND GESTURES.

84
00:02:44,290 --> 00:02:45,591
THEY HAVE RESTRICTIONS ON

85
00:02:45,591 --> 00:02:48,661
FREEDOM OF SPEECH.

86
00:02:48,661 --> 00:02:51,965
YET, ROGER GOODELL IN HIS

87
00:02:51,965 --> 00:02:55,468
INFINITE WISDOM, ALLOWED

88
00:02:55,468 --> 00:02:57,203
EVERYTHING THAT HAPPENED LAST

89
00:02:57,203 --> 00:02:57,904
YEAR.

90
00:02:57,904 --> 00:02:58,871
PEOPLE WHO FOUGHT AND DIED UNDER

91
00:02:58,871 --> 00:03:00,206
THAT FLAG.

92
00:03:00,206 --> 00:03:03,276
I AM NOT AGAINST PROTESTING BUT

93
00:03:03,276 --> 00:03:06,212
THE NFL DOES STIFLE FREEDOM OF

94
00:03:06,212 --> 00:03:07,714
SPEECH IN SOME WAYS.

95
00:03:07,714 --> 00:03:09,148
I AM DONE WITH THE NFL.

96
00:03:09,148 --> 00:03:11,351
NOW THEY WILL LET PLAYERS HIDE

97
00:03:11,351 --> 00:03:16,289
IN THE LOCKER ROOM WHICH IS

98
00:03:16,289 --> 00:03:17,490
WORSE THAN BEFORE WHEN OUR

99
00:03:17,490 --> 00:03:18,391
NATIONAL ANTHEM IS PLAY.

100
00:03:18,391 --> 00:03:19,258
TELL US WHAT HAPPENED WITH THE

101
00:03:19,258 --> 00:03:19,592
EAGLES.

102
00:03:19,592 --> 00:03:21,661
>> WELL, THERE IS A LOT TO

103
00:03:21,661 --> 00:03:22,362
UNPACK THERE.

104
00:03:22,362 --> 00:03:24,831
THE PRESIDENT COULD NOT BE MORE

105
00:03:24,831 --> 00:03:26,566
CLEAR ON HIS POSITION ON THE

106
00:03:26,566 --> 00:03:27,100
NATIONAL ANTHEM.

107
00:03:27,100 --> 00:03:29,969
HE MADE A SIMPLE REQUEST THAT

108
00:03:29,969 --> 00:03:33,272
PEOPLE SHOULD STAND FOR THE

109
00:03:33,272 --> 00:03:34,807
FLAG.

110
00:03:34,807 --> 00:03:37,143
BEFORE PEOPLE SAYS EVERYBODY

111
00:03:37,143 --> 00:03:39,145
STOOD FOR THE PLAG.

112
00:03:39,145 --> 00:03:40,613
THIS WAS A DECISION THE

113
00:03:40,613 --> 00:03:42,548
PRESIDENT MADE ON HOW THAT WAS

114
00:03:42,548 --> 00:03:42,949
HANDLED.

115
00:03:42,949 --> 00:03:44,851
NOT BASED ON WHAT HAPPENED LAST

116
00:03:44,851 --> 00:03:45,852
SEASON.

117
00:03:45,852 --> 00:03:47,687
IT IS THE NFL, NOT THE WHITE

118
00:03:47,687 --> 00:03:48,821
HOUSE AND NOT THE PRESIDENT WHO

119
00:03:48,821 --> 00:03:50,823
CAME OUT WITH A BRAND NEW POLICY

120
00:03:50,823 --> 00:03:53,493
THAT GOVERNS WHAT ITS PLAYERS

121
00:03:53,493 --> 00:03:54,060
WILL DO.

122
00:03:54,060 --> 00:03:57,063
THAT'S BETWEEN THE NFL AND ITS

123
00:03:57,063 --> 00:03:57,397
PLAYERS.

124
00:03:57,397 --> 00:03:58,431
THEY CAME OUT WITH THE POLICY

125
00:03:58,431 --> 00:04:00,833
LAST MONTH THAT PERHAPS SOME OF

126
00:04:00,833 --> 00:04:01,868
THE PLAYERS ON DIFFERENT TEAMS

127
00:04:01,868 --> 00:04:03,069
DON'T LIKE.

128
00:04:03,069 --> 00:04:04,670
SEAN, I THINK THE PRESIDENT WAS

129
00:04:04,670 --> 00:04:07,807
FOCUSSED ON THE RIGHT NUMBER.

130
00:04:07,807 --> 00:04:10,376
THAT WAS THE 1,000 EAGLES FANS

131
00:04:10,376 --> 00:04:11,844
THAT RESPONDED TO THE WHITE

132
00:04:11,844 --> 00:04:12,145
HOUSE.

133
00:04:12,145 --> 00:04:13,613
MANY OF WHOM WERE ALREADY IN

134
00:04:13,613 --> 00:04:16,149
TOWN EXPECTING TO COME TO THE

135
00:04:16,149 --> 00:04:16,949
WHITE HOUSE.

136
00:04:16,949 --> 00:04:18,517
HE DECIDED TO RESPECT THEIR

137
00:04:18,517 --> 00:04:21,154
EFFORT IN COMING AND THEIR

138
00:04:21,154 --> 00:04:21,853
EXCITEMENT AND STILL WELCOME

139
00:04:21,853 --> 00:04:22,555
THEM TO THE WHITE HOUSE AND

140
00:04:22,555 --> 00:04:24,791
CONVERT IT INTO A CELEBRATE

141
00:04:24,791 --> 00:04:25,725
AMERICA EVENT.

142
00:04:25,725 --> 00:04:28,861
IT WAS A FABULOUS EVENT TODAY

143
00:04:28,861 --> 00:04:31,197
WITH THE MARINE CORP BAND AND

144
00:04:31,197 --> 00:04:31,497
SONGS.

145
00:04:31,497 --> 00:04:32,832
THERE WERE A LOT OF EAGLES

146
00:04:32,832 --> 00:04:34,367
PLAYERS WHO VOTED FOR DONALD

147
00:04:34,367 --> 00:00:00,000
TRUMP AND SUPPORT MANY OF HIS
