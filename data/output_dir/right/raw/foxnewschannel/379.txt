00:00:07,018 --> 00:00:08,219
>> Laura: IS A CONFIRMATION

2
00:00:08,220 --> 00:00:09,453
VOTE FOR A BRETT KAVANAUGH LOOKS

3
00:00:09,454 --> 00:00:11,188
SAD THIS WEEKEND WE CAN FORGET

4
00:00:11,189 --> 00:00:12,890
WHAT HAPPENED AT THE VERY START

5
00:00:12,891 --> 00:00:14,124
OF THIS WHOLE THING.

6
00:00:14,125 --> 00:00:16,293
MOST IMPORTANTLY, HOW DID

7
00:00:16,294 --> 00:00:19,163
REPORTERS GET THEIR HANDS ON

8
00:00:19,164 --> 00:00:19,930
CHRISTINE BLASEY FORD'S ACCOUNT

9
00:00:19,931 --> 00:00:21,999
IN THE FIRST PLACE?

10
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:22,900
"THE WASHINGTON POST" SAYS THAT

11
00:00:22,901 --> 00:00:25,536
SHE MADE THE INITIAL CONTACT

12
00:00:25,537 --> 00:00:27,838
THROUGH THE ANONYMOUS TIP LINE.

13
00:00:27,839 --> 00:00:29,640
AND ONLY AFTER SHE HAD BUILT A

14
00:00:29,641 --> 00:00:32,843
RAPPORT WITH THE REPORTER, SHE

15
00:00:32,844 --> 00:00:35,212
DECIDED TO COME FORWARD AND GIVE

16
00:00:35,213 --> 00:00:37,047
HER ON THE RECORD ACCOUNTS.

17
00:00:37,048 --> 00:00:38,015
I WANT TO PLAY THIS MOMENT

18
00:00:38,016 --> 00:00:39,016
DURING THE HEARING THAT REALLY

19
00:00:39,017 --> 00:00:41,018
JUMPED OUT AT ME WHEN I FIRST

20
00:00:41,019 --> 00:00:41,418
WATCHED IT.

21
00:00:41,419 --> 00:00:43,020
I DON'T THINK IT'S GETTING

22
00:00:43,021 --> 00:00:43,821
ENOUGH ATTENTION.

23
00:00:43,822 --> 00:00:45,456
FORD WAS ASKED ABOUT THE

24
00:00:45,457 --> 00:00:46,223
DECISION TO COME FORWARD AND

25
00:00:46,224 --> 00:00:49,426
SAID THIS.

26
00:00:49,427 --> 00:00:50,361
>> ULTIMATELY BECAUSE REPORTERS

27
00:00:50,362 --> 00:00:53,397
WERE SITTING OUTSIDE OF MY HOME,

28
00:00:53,398 --> 00:00:57,101
A REPORTER APPEARED AND MY

29
00:00:57,102 --> 00:00:57,801
GRADUATE CLASSROOM AND I MUST

30
00:00:57,802 --> 00:00:59,803
OCCUR FOR A STUDENT.

31
00:00:59,804 --> 00:01:03,374
SHE CAME UP TO ASKING A QUESTION

32
00:01:03,375 --> 00:01:04,642
AND I THOUGHT THAT SHE WAS A

33
00:01:04,643 --> 00:01:05,409
STUDENT AND IT TURNED OUT THAT

34
00:01:05,410 --> 00:01:08,579
SHE WAS A REPORTER.

35
00:01:08,580 --> 00:01:08,946
>> Laura:

36
00:01:08,947 --> 00:01:11,782
"THE WASHINGTON POST" IN THE

37
00:01:11,783 --> 00:01:12,516
STATEMENT REAFFIRMED THAT FORD

38
00:01:12,517 --> 00:01:15,386
CAME TO THEM SOLELY THROUGH

39
00:01:15,387 --> 00:01:18,422
THEIR TIP LINE AND THAT IT WAS

40
00:01:18,423 --> 00:01:19,823
UNDER SOME OTHER OUTLETS I

41
00:01:19,824 --> 00:01:20,624
CONFRONTED HER AT HER HOME AND

42
00:01:20,625 --> 00:01:22,860
PLACE OF RESIDENCE.

43
00:01:22,861 --> 00:01:25,796
WHERE DOES THAT LEAVE US?

44
00:01:25,797 --> 00:01:28,365
BACK TO DEMOCRATIC MEMBERS OF

45
00:01:28,366 --> 00:01:29,767
THE SENATE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE,

46
00:01:29,768 --> 00:01:31,602
REMEMBER SENATOR FEINSTEIN WAS

47
00:01:31,603 --> 00:01:32,469
CONFRONTED ABOUT POSSIBLE LEAKS

48
00:01:32,470 --> 00:01:34,138
LAST WEEK AND HAD THIS KIND OF

49
00:01:34,139 --> 00:01:37,708
INTERESTING EXCHANGE WITH

50
00:01:37,709 --> 00:01:38,609
SENATOR JOHN.

51
00:01:38,610 --> 00:01:39,743
>> CAN YOU TELL US THAT YOUR

52
00:01:39,744 --> 00:01:41,378
STAFF DID NOT LEAK IT?

53
00:01:41,379 --> 00:01:44,214
>> I DON'T BELIEVE MY STAFF

54
00:01:44,215 --> 00:01:45,382
WOULD LEAK IT.

55
00:01:45,383 --> 00:01:47,251
I HAVE NOT ASKED THAT QUESTION

56
00:01:47,252 --> 00:01:47,618
DIRECTLY.

57
00:01:47,619 --> 00:01:49,053
>> DO YOU KNOW THAT?

58
00:01:49,054 --> 00:01:53,023
HAVE YOU ASKED THEM?

59
00:01:53,024 --> 00:01:53,624
>> ADJUSTED.

60
00:01:53,625 --> 00:01:57,628
PARDON ME?

61
00:01:57,629 --> 00:01:58,662
JENNIFER REMIND ME COME I'VE

62
00:01:58,663 --> 00:02:00,365
ASKED YOU BEFORE ABOUT IT

63
00:02:04,836 --> 00:02:05,536
>> Laura: WELL, THE JENNIFER

64
00:02:05,537 --> 00:02:08,339
SHE REFERENCED THERE IS A WOMAN

65
00:02:08,340 --> 00:02:09,606
NAMED JENNIFER DUCK, HER

66
00:02:09,607 --> 00:02:11,041
LONGTIME CHIEF OF STAFF WHO NOW

67
00:02:11,042 --> 00:02:11,775
WORKS ON THE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE

68
00:02:11,776 --> 00:02:14,244
FOR THE DEMOCRATS.

69
00:02:14,245 --> 00:02:15,179
IT SEEMS TO BE THE AUTHORITY ON

70
00:02:15,180 --> 00:02:16,980
THE QUESTION OF LEAKS.

71
00:02:16,981 --> 00:02:19,083
WE TAKE THE POST AS HER WORDS

72
00:02:19,084 --> 00:02:20,317
THAT THEIR INVOLVEMENT IN THE

73
00:02:20,318 --> 00:02:22,052
STORY CAME SOLELY THROUGH THE

74
00:02:22,053 --> 00:02:26,423
TIP LINE BUT WE ARE LESS CLEAR

75
00:02:26,424 --> 00:02:28,425
ON HOW THE OTHER REPORTERS FOUND

76
00:02:28,426 --> 00:02:30,160
THEMSELVES IN POSSESSION OF HER

77
00:02:30,161 --> 00:02:31,028
IDENTITY?

78
00:02:31,029 --> 00:02:31,829
IT IS STRANGE.

79
00:02:31,830 --> 00:02:34,998
WE REACHED OUT TO HER OFFICE FOR

80
00:02:34,999 --> 00:02:36,300
CLARITY AND AS A 5 MINUTES AGO

81
00:02:36,301 --> 00:02:38,402
THEY HAD NOT GOTTEN BACK TO US.

82
00:02:38,403 --> 00:02:41,805
HERE TO REACT, HOWARD KURTZ, THE

83
00:02:41,806 --> 00:02:43,006
HOST OF MEDIA BUZZ.

84
00:02:43,007 --> 00:02:44,408
AMERICAN CONSERVATIVE UNION,

85
00:02:44,409 --> 00:02:45,008
MATT IS FLAT.

86
00:02:45,009 --> 00:02:47,378
HOW WOULD, LET'S START WITH YOU.

87
00:02:47,379 --> 00:02:48,345
SO MANY POST IS BEING HONEST,

88
00:02:48,346 --> 00:02:53,183
HOW DO WE THINK ALL THESE OTHER

89
00:02:53,184 --> 00:02:55,219
REPORTERS FOUND OUT ABOUT FORD?

90
00:02:55,220 --> 00:02:57,421
>> EXTREMELY STRONG

91
00:02:57,422 --> 00:02:58,021
CIRCUMSTANTIAL EVIDENCE.

92
00:02:58,022 --> 00:02:59,022
STAFF MEMBERS DON'T TELL THE

93
00:02:59,023 --> 00:03:00,624
BOSS, I'M ABOUT TO LEAK THIS.

94
00:03:00,625 --> 00:03:06,463
LOOKS WHERE THE LEAKS WENT?

95
00:03:06,464 --> 00:03:07,731
"THE NEW YORK TIMES" ," IT'S ABO

96
00:03:07,732 --> 00:03:07,965
"THE NEW YORK TIMES" ," IT'S ABT

A WOMAN.

98
00:03:08,299 --> 00:03:10,334
AND THEN IT WAS A BUZZ FEED

99
00:03:10,335 --> 00:03:12,903
REPORTER, A LIBERAL SITE THAT

100
00:03:12,904 --> 00:03:17,174
WENT TO HER HOME.

101
00:03:17,175 --> 00:03:18,175
AND FINALLY THE NEW YORKER GETS

102
00:03:18,176 --> 00:03:20,310
THE ACTUAL LETTER AND PUBLISHES

103
00:03:20,311 --> 00:03:21,345
IT.

104
00:03:21,346 --> 00:03:22,479
CHRISTINE FORD SAID, PEOPLE KNOW

105
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:23,480
WHO I AM.

106
00:03:23,481 --> 00:03:24,114
JOURNALIST KNOW WHO I AM.

107
00:03:24,115 --> 00:03:26,583
I WILL TELL MY OWN STORY.

108
00:03:26,584 --> 00:03:30,220
>> Laura: MATT, THE IDEA THAT

109
00:03:30,221 --> 00:03:32,623
SOME PERSON LIKE CHRISTINE FORD,

110
00:03:32,624 --> 00:03:33,891
I WILL JUST TYPE IT ON THE

111
00:03:33,892 --> 00:03:38,395
ANONYMOUS TIP LINE.

112
00:03:38,396 --> 00:03:39,129
SOMETHING ABOUT THE STORY JUST

113
00:03:39,130 --> 00:03:41,732
DOESN'T ADD UP.

114
00:03:41,733 --> 00:03:45,102
GIVEN THE IMPORTANCE OF GUARDING

115
00:03:45,103 --> 00:03:48,772
THESE DOCUMENTS, ON COOPERATED

116
00:03:48,773 --> 00:03:50,541
FROM THE COMMITTEE, TO AVOID

117
00:03:50,542 --> 00:03:51,108
THIS HAPPENING AGAIN.

118
00:03:51,109 --> 00:03:52,876
SHOULDN'T IT BE THE CASE THAT

119
00:03:52,877 --> 00:03:58,015
THEY SELL A PHONE, EMAILS, THE

120
00:03:58,016 --> 00:03:59,082
TAX, WHETHER DELETED OR NOT ARE

121
00:03:59,083 --> 00:03:59,450
PRESERVED.

122
00:03:59,451 --> 00:04:02,686
YOU CAN GET THEM BACK.

123
00:04:02,687 --> 00:04:05,189
ALL OF THOSE ARE PRESERVED AND

124
00:04:05,190 --> 00:04:06,790
WE FIND OUT ANY CONNECTIONS

125
00:04:06,791 --> 00:04:09,793
BETWEEN HER OFFICE IN

126
00:04:09,794 --> 00:04:10,360
"THE WASHINGTON POST."

127
00:04:10,361 --> 00:04:11,829
SPECIFICALLY, FRIENDSHIPS,

128
00:04:11,830 --> 00:04:12,930
ROMANTIC RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN

129
00:04:12,931 --> 00:04:14,798
FEINSTEIN'S PEOPLE IN THE POST.

130
00:04:14,799 --> 00:04:19,002
>> ADAM THOMAS AND ANITA HILL,

131
00:04:19,003 --> 00:04:20,370
THERE WAS SOME SIMILAR THINGS.

132
00:04:20,370 --> 00:04:22,239
WHEN YOU GO BACK INTO THIS FBI

133
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:22,973
REPORT, ONLY SENATORS CAN LOOK

134
00:04:22,974 --> 00:04:24,608
AT IT.

135
00:04:24,609 --> 00:04:26,009
I THINK WE WILL HAVE SOME

136
00:04:26,010 --> 00:04:26,610
LEARNINGS OUT OF THIS.

137
00:04:26,611 --> 00:04:27,978
HERE'S WHAT WE KNOW.

138
00:04:27,979 --> 00:04:30,280
EITHER DR. FORD IS A TERRIBLE

139
00:04:30,281 --> 00:04:32,349
VICTIM OR DR. FORD IN

140
00:04:32,350 --> 00:04:35,452
COMBINATION WITH THESE DEMOCRATS

141
00:04:35,453 --> 00:04:37,120
AND MAY BE THE DEMOCRAT WHO

142
00:04:37,121 --> 00:04:40,524
STARTED THIS WHOLE THING ON THE

143
00:04:40,525 --> 00:04:41,425
LAWYERS, THEY WERE TRYING TO

144
00:04:41,426 --> 00:04:45,195
AGGRESSIVELY PUSH HER TO BE

145
00:04:45,196 --> 00:04:46,196
PUBLIC.

146
00:04:46,197 --> 00:04:47,097
THEY WERE ACTUALLY LEAKING ON

147
00:04:47,098 --> 00:04:49,800
DR. FORD TO GET HER OUT THERE.

148
00:04:49,801 --> 00:04:51,034
THEY WANTED THE MOTIONS OF THAT

149
00:04:51,035 --> 00:04:51,768
HEARING.

150
00:04:51,769 --> 00:04:53,437
THAT IS WHAT THEY WANTED.

151
00:04:53,438 --> 00:04:54,805
THEY THOUGHT THAT WOULD DERAIL

152
00:04:54,806 --> 00:04:55,138
AT ALL.

153
00:04:55,139 --> 00:04:56,507
THEY GOT THE OPPOSITE.

154
00:04:56,508 --> 00:04:58,442
>> Laura: HOW WE,

155
00:04:58,443 --> 00:04:59,409
"THE WASHINGTON POST" RESPONDED

156
00:04:59,410 --> 00:05:01,612
TO US TODAY BY SAYING "NOBODY

157
00:05:01,613 --> 00:05:02,813
LEAK ANYTHING TO US.

158
00:05:02,814 --> 00:05:03,680
SHE DECIDED SHE WAS WILLING TO

159
00:05:03,681 --> 00:05:06,250
PUT HER NAME ON THE RECORD AFTER

160
00:05:06,251 --> 00:05:07,784
REPORTERS FROM OTHER OUTLETS

161
00:05:07,785 --> 00:05:08,719
APPEARED AT HER HOME AND

162
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:11,488
WORKPLACE AT WHICH TIME WE

163
00:05:11,489 --> 00:05:14,625
DECIDED TO PUBLISH HER STORY."

164
00:05:14,626 --> 00:05:16,059
AGAIN, DOES THAT RING TRUE?

165
00:05:16,060 --> 00:05:17,995
>> IT IS TRUE THAT

166
00:05:17,996 --> 00:05:18,795
"THE WASHINGTON POST" DIDN'T GO

167
00:05:18,796 --> 00:05:19,763
WITH IT WITHOUT HER INTERVIEWS,

168
00:05:19,764 --> 00:05:33,544
THE THERAPIST NOTES AT ALL THAT.

169
00:05:33,545 --> 00:05:34,211
THEY TRY TO DO A LEGITIMATE

170
00:05:34,212 --> 00:05:34,645
INVESTIGATION.

171
00:05:34,646 --> 00:05:35,379
I HAVE COVERED SO MANY OF THESE

172
00:05:35,380 --> 00:05:35,712
STORIES.

173
00:05:35,713 --> 00:05:36,346
IT BECOMES AN OPEN SECRET.

174
00:05:36,347 --> 00:05:37,047
A SOURCE TELLS ONE REPORT, MAY

175
00:05:37,048 --> 00:05:37,781
BE A SOURCE TELLS TWO REPORTERS.

176
00:05:37,782 --> 00:05:38,649
NOBODY QUITE WANTS TO GO WITH I

177
00:05:38,650 --> 00:05:38,916
IT.

178
00:05:38,917 --> 00:05:39,650
EVENTUALLY IT GETS OUT THERE,

179
00:05:39,651 --> 00:05:39,918
SOMEBODY GOES AND

180
00:05:40,985 --> 00:05:43,120
AMBUSH THE PERSON OR HANG OUT OR

181
00:05:43,121 --> 00:05:45,756
STALK THEM.

182
00:05:45,757 --> 00:05:47,891
THAT IS HOW IT EVENTUALLY GETS

183
00:05:47,892 --> 00:05:49,526
PRINTED.

184
00:05:49,527 --> 00:05:51,094
I BELIEVE THAT CHRISTINE FORD

185
00:05:51,095 --> 00:05:52,964
WAS POP MIKE PRESSURED

186
00:05:55,533 --> 00:05:58,101
>> Laura: THIS WAS ALSO

187
00:05:58,102 --> 00:05:59,970
REGARDING WHAT IS IT CALLED?

188
00:05:59,971 --> 00:06:03,173
"DEVILS TRIANGLE" ."

189
00:06:03,174 --> 00:06:03,941
THIS WAS DON LEMON LAST NIGHT.

190
00:06:03,942 --> 00:06:06,043
