covert operations means the mission and
the actor carrying out that mission are
to remain secret and unknown a clean
destino operation is one in which the
actor conducting the operation is
eventually going to be known so when it
comes to the bin Laden raid this is
interesting because it's another case of
SEAL Team 6 members being put under the
chain of command of the Central
Intelligence Agency and this was done so
that they could conduct cross-border
operations into Pakistan under title 50
authorities so yes that technically was
a covert operation and a lot of
information got leaked to the press
by the White House and others they were
very quick to claim credit for that
mission and that probably shouldn't have
happened
definitely not as quickly as it did
