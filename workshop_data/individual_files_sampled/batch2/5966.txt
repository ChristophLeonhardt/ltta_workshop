it's an ID chairman Grassley scheduled a committee vote on Brent Cavanaugh's nomination for Friday morning only hours after dr. Ford's testimony this Thursday something Senator Dianne Feinstein has called outrageous for more I'm joined by Susan page USA Today Washington bureau chief Zerlina Maxwell senior director of progressive programming for Sirius XM and Michael Steele former RNC chair thank you all I wanted to talk to Susan about the oddness of eleven men who have waited all their lives to be members of the Judiciary Committee they've been elected and selected to be on that committee waited with bated breath for these hot on television hearings with everybody watching free advertising and they don't want it they don't want to touch this they want somebody they're outsourcing to some sex crimes prosecutor a woman that committed do the work form so not even at the committee counsel it's an outsider whose name we don't know yet a female assistant as a mercenary much Mitch McConnell look what do you make of it I think it illustrates how toxic they think this has the potential to be for themselves and for their party they're already struggling withholding the support of suburban women who have been part of the Republican coalition but who have been their support has been eroding during since President Trump was elected and could get eroded a lot further depending what happens now what do you think the camera will look like Michael the cameras could be on that hearing and it's gonna be on the members of the committee go and there be potted plants sitting up there guys like Orrin Hatch's noted for his commentary in this area saying the woman's confused she's mixed up sitting there so with their facial expressions MOT some sort of support for the tough questioning or dismissing the comments and the testimony of dr. Ford what are their what's a role their their role is to do exactly what you just described they are hiding behind the skirt of a woman who will question in their stead another woman about allegations that she's made and that to me I don't care how you try to reframe this the cameras are not going to be on the questioner the cameras are going to be on the 11 white men sitting behind the questioner as these questions which by the way will probably part of what they want asked so they're gonna be reflective of what their particular staffs have come up without without their attitude right but no one no one watching this will walk away thinking oh well this was a conversation between two women no it's 11 men behind a woman asking dr. Ford these questions and that image is going to be one that's gonna haunt them right through the November I wonder what the question is going to be life because this brought in outside prosecutor with a record experience in sex crimes that's interesting in itself sex crimes that's her specialty we'll also be questioning the Supreme Court nominee red Cavanaugh that's gonna be interesting I wonder how tough that's gonna be your thoughts there Lina well I do think that it's very funny that if you notice Chris we haven't mentioned the name of this sex crimes prosecutor we didn't know Republicans are withholding her name to protect her safety so they're putting more thought into the safety of the prosecutor they're bringing in to basically shill on their behalf and not thinking about dr. Ford and what's appropriate for her and that is proof because they've already scheduled the vote Chris so if they are really going to do more than words seriously then you can't schedule a Friday morning vote because you don't know what anyone is going to say on Thursday said to protect your safety what do you mean well it's been reported that they're withholding the name of this prosecutor because they're thinking of obviously they you know shall become a target of attacks but I do think you sure that's for Rio or that's for show that sounds like theater to me well look Chris I'm just going based on reporting I don't I don't know about reporting of what the Republicans are saying right and I wonder whether they're dead playing a little game here of theater like oh boy they've been so terrible the left-wing on this the progressives that we have to protect her physically from their assaults that sounds like PR it is PR Chris you're absolutely right I was giving them way too much benefit them doubt what I really think is Republicans are putting on a complete and total sham hearing on Thursday we still don't know the full details of the allegation that Michael avenatti is client is going to put forward obvious what he has already put out into the public domain is very serious even more serious than the first two allegations and so we've had an interview with Brett Kavanaugh and his wife although he didn't allow her to express and answer questions directly posed to her he repeated the same lines over and over and so today we're in a very difficult place but Republicans clearly are not understanding the moment we are in we are a year into the me2 movement which is a response to the election of Donald Trump today we saw Bill Cosby finally be held accountable for raping nearly 60 women over the course of decades and so I think that their misunderstanding this moment and it's at their peril well during his interview with Fox Cavanaugh did that was last night at 7:00 he denied the claim made by Debra Ramirez in The New Yorker and that others found the alligator's found the allegation inconceivable he's speaking for others here let's hear the judge let's watch I never did any such thing the other people alleged to be there don't recall any such thing if such a thing had happened it would have been the talk of campus the women I knew in college and the men I knew in college says it's inconceivable that I could have done such a thing well he says they say it was then concealed anyway however Cavanaugh g/l roommate at the time James Roche issued this statement that Ramirez's claim is credible and consistent with the Kavanagh he knew of his roommate his roommate in that statement wrote snouted quote I would see him as he returned from nights out with his friends it is from this experience that I concluded that although bread was normally reserved he was probably a notably heavy drinker even by the standards of the time and that he became aggressive and belligerent when he was very drunk the night Ramirez's lawyers tweeted that they have reached out to the Senate Judiciary Committee to cooperate but so far the committee has refused to meet all scheduled appointments so they're keeping Ramirez are pretty far away what do you make of this dr. Jekyll and mr. Hyde a description of the guy's roommate judge Kavanagh yeah well you know I think it's part of the mix of you know we've got people who say no ID we've got people who say no this isn't the way we hate but we also have people who rumi yes is really there I'm Chris Hayes from MSNBC thanks for watching MSNBC on YouTube if you want to keep up to date with the videos we're putting out you can click subscribe just below me or click over on this list to see lots of other great videos
