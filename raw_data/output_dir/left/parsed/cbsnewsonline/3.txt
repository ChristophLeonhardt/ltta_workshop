ME, I'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT 
DRUG PRICE REDUCTIONS FOR A 
LONG TIME, AND NOW WE ARE DOING 
THINGS THAT NOBODY WAS, LET'S 
SAY, SPEAKING ON BEHALF OF ALL 
OF US, BOLD ENOUGH TO DO, THEY 
ARE GOING TO HAVE A TREMENDOUS 
IMPACT, I WENT TO THANKS THE 
FDA COMMISSIONER SCOTT GOTTLIEB,
AN INCREDIBLE JOB. 
AND CMS ADMINISTRATOR, GREAT 
JOB.
>>> I AM THRILLED TO BE HERE AT 
THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND 
HUMAN SERVICES, AND I WANT TO 
THINK EVERYBODY, I UNDERSTAND 
THERE HAS BEEN DECADES SINCE 
THE LAST PRESIDENT CAME HERE. 
I AM SURPRISED THAT PRESIDENT 
OBAMA DIDN'T COME HERE FOR 
OBAMACARE, EXPLAINED THAT TO 
ME, BUT HE DIDN'T. 
HE GREAT HONOR TO BE HERE, YOU 
DO AN INCREDIBLE JOB. 
I THINK YOU. 
SINCE THE DAY I TOOK OFFICE, I 
MADE REDUCING DRUG PRICES MY 
PRIORITY, MORE THAN 1000 LOW-
COST GENERICS WERE MADE, THE 
MOST IN THE HISTORY OF THE 
COUNTRY, THIS YEAR WE BEAT THAT 
RECORD, APPROVING MORE 
GENERICS, LEADING TO CHEAPER 
COMPETITIVE ALTERNATIVES FOR 
LIFE-SAVING DRUGS LIKE THE 
EPIPEN, SAVING ALMOST $9 
BILLION A YEAR LAST YEAR ALONE. 
SINCE RELEASING MY DRUG PRICING 
BLUEPRINT IN MAY, 16 DRUG 
COMPANIES REDUCED THEIR LIST 
PRICES, ROLLBACK INCREASES OR 
FROZE THEIR PRICES FOR THE REST 
OF THE YEAR. 
WE CALLED A FEW OF THOSE 
COMPANIES RECENTLY, WHERE THEY 
RAISED THE PRICES, I GUESS 
MAYBE IT WAS ONE OF THE TIMES 
THAT I REALIZED HOW POWERFUL 
THE PRESIDENCY IS, BECAUSE THEY 
IMMEDIATELY ROLLED THEIR PRICES 
BACK TO WHERE THEY STARTED, AND 
THOSE COMPANIES KNOW WHO WE ARE 
TALKING ABOUT AND WE 
APPRECIATED VERY MUCH. 
I SIGNED TWO BILLS TO LOWER THE 
COST OF PRESCRIPTION DRUGS, THE 
KNOW THE LOWEST PRICE ACT, A 
BIG THING, AND THE PATIENT 
RIGHT TO KNOW ACT, PUT THEM 
TOGETHER, YOU HAVE A 
COMPLICATED DEAL. 
IT SOUNDS CIVIL, BUT THAT IS 
NOT. 
ENDING THE UNJUST GAG CLAUSES 
ONCE AND FOR ALL, WHERE YOU GO 
INTO A DRUGSTORE, AND THE 
PHARMACIST WOULDN'T EVEN BE 
ALLOWED TO TALK ABOUT 
ALTERNATIVES OF PRICING, HOW 
RIDICULOUS IS THAT, THAT IS NOT 
GOING TO TAKE PLACE ANYMORE. 
AND THE PHARMACISTS ARE VERY 
HAPPY ABOUT IT. 
PATIENTS HAVE THE RIGHT TO KNOW 
THE LOWEST PRICE AND THE MOST 
AFFORDABLE ALTERNATIVE AT THE 
PHARMACY, TODAY, WE ARE HERE TO 
ANNOUNCE ANOTHER BOLD AND 
HISTORIC ACTION TO BRING DOWN 
THE PRICE OF PRESCRIPTION 
DRUGS. 
WITH THE ACTION I AM UNVEILING 
TODAY, THE UNITED STATES WILL 
FINALLY BEGIN TO CONFRONT ONE 
OF THE MOST UNFAIR PRACTICES, 
ALMOST UNIMAGINABLE THAT IT HAS 
NOT BEEN TAKING CARE OF LONG 
BEFORE THIS, IT DRIVES UP THE 
COST OF MEDICINE IN THE UNITED 
STATES. 
WE ARE TAKING AIM AT THE GLOBAL 
FREELOADING THAT FORCES 
AMERICAN CONSUMERS TO SUBSIDIZE 
LOWER PRICES IN FOREIGN 
COUNTRIES THROUGH HIGHER PRICES 
IN OUR COUNTRY. 
I'VE SEEN IT FOR YEARS, I'VE 
NEVER UNDERSTOOD IT, THE SAME 
COMPANY, SAME BOX, SAME PILL, 
MADE IN THE EXACT SAME 
LOCATION, AND IN SOME COUNTRIES 
IT WOULD BE 20% THE COST OF 
WHAT WE PAY, AND IN SOME CASES 
MUCH LESS THAN THAT, AND I SAY 
WHY IS THIS, I DIDN'T KNOW THAT 
I WOULD BE ABLE TO STAND BEFORE 
YOU AND HAVE A CHANCE TO FIX 
IT, THAT IS WHAT WE ARE DOING, 
WE ARE FIXING IT, THAT'S CALLED 
REAL LIFE EXPERIENCE. 
OTHER COUNTRIES HAVE RIGGED THE 
SYSTEM SO THAT AMERICAN 
PATIENTS ARE CHARGED MUCH MORE, 
AND IN SOME CASES MUCH, MUCH 
MORE FOR THE EXACT SAME DRUG. 
AMERICANS PAY MORE SO THAT 
OTHERS CAN PAY LESS, IT'S 
WRONG, IT'S UNFAIR, TRADE DEALS,
A COST MORE THAN EVEN THIS, WE 
ARE CHANGING THEM ALSO. 
FOREIGN COUNTRIES, EVEN 
THREATENED TO DISRESPECT OUR 
PATENTS IF THEY ARE NOT GIVEN 
CHEAPER PRICES ON DRUGS, THEY 
ARE NOT GOING TO EVEN LOOK AT 
THE FACTS, THEY HAVE BEEN 
DISRESPECTFUL -- DISRESPECTFUL 
TO OUR COUNTRY. 
AND TO ALL THE THINGS WE STAND 
FOR. 
AND ESPECIALLY DISRESPECTING 
PATENTS, WHEN IT CAME TO 
AMERICAN-MADE DRUGS. 
EFFECTIVELY FUNDING RESEARCH 
AND DEVELOPMENT FOR THE ENTIRE 
PLANET, WE ARE PLAYING FOR -- 
PAYING FOR, EVERYONE IS 
BENEFITING, BUT THEY'RE PAYING 
NOTHING TOWARDS RESEARCH AND 
DEVELOPMENT. 
THE WORLD REAPS THE RESULTS OF 
AMERICAN GENIUS AND INNOVATION, 
WHILE AMERICAN CITIZENS, 
ESPECIALLY OUR GREAT SENIORS, 
HIT THE HARDEST, PICK UP THE 
TAB, BUT NO LONGER, HERE ARE 
JUST A FEW EXAMPLES, FOR ONE I 
MEDICATION THAT HELPS PREVENT 
BLINDNESS, PAYING OVER $1 
BILLION A YEAR. 
IF WE PAY PRICES OTHER NATIONS 
PAY, WE WOULD BRING $1 BILLION 
DOWN TO $187 MILLION A YEAR. 
PRETTY AMAZING, ISN'T IT? 
WE SPEND MORE THAN $1 BILLION A 
YEAR ON TWO DRUGS TO TREAT BONE 
DISEASE, BUT WE COULD SAVE MORE 
THAN $800 BILLION, THINK OF 
THAT, $800 BILLION SAVINGS, FOR 
OUR SENIORS, BY PAYING PRICES 
THAT OTHER COUNTRIES PAY, 
NOTHING SPECIAL, JUST THE 
PRICES THAT OTHER COUNTRIES 
PAY, THAT IS THE WAY THE UNITED 
STATES HAS BEEN DISRESPECTED 
FOR TOO LONG AND TOO MANY WAYS. 
ONE COMMON CANCER DRUG IS 
NEARLY 7 TIMES AS EXPENSIVE FOR 
MEDICARE AS IT IS FOR OTHER 
COUNTRIES. 
A HIGHLY USED IN VERY EFFECTIVE 
DRUG. 
AND IT IS SEVEN TIMES MORE 
EXPENSIVE. 
NOT FAIR THIS HAPPENS BECAUSE 
THE GOVERNMENT PAYS WHATEVER 
PRICE THE DRUG COMPANIES SET, 
WITHOUT ANY NEGOTIATIONS 
WHATSOEVER, NOT ANYMORE. 
UNDER OUR NEW PLAN, THE 
DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN 
SERVICES TO ALLOW MEDICARE TO 
DETERMINE THE PRICE IT PAYS FOR 
CERTAIN DRUGS, BASED ON THE 
CHEAPER PRICES PAID BY OTHER 
NATIONS. 
SOME PEEPER -- PEOPLE CALL IT 
FAVORED NATION STATUS, AND 
CONTRACTS THAT I'VE BEEN A PART 
OF, FAVORED NATIONS, THINK OF 
THAT, SO WE ARE PAYING A PRICE 
BASED ON THE PRICE THAT OTHER 
NATIONS ARE PAYING, NO LONGER 
SEVEN TIMES MORE, NO LONGER 10 
TIMES, 11 TIMES, EVEN 12 TIMES 
MORE I'VE SEEN EXAMPLES PAYING 
THE SAME PRICE, BILLIONS AND 
BILLIONS OF SAVINGS TO PEOPLE. 
WE WILL NO LONGER ACCEPT THE 
INFLATED PRICES BEING CHARGED 
TO OUR SENIORS. 
I HAD A CONGRESSMAN, A 
RESPECTED CONGRESSMAN, COME TO 
THE OVAL OFFICE, AND SAY SIR, 
FOR MY CONSTITUENTS, DRUG 
PRICING IS MORE IMPORTANT THAN 
HEALTHCARE. 
AND I SAID EXPLAIN THAT TO ME, 
BUT HE SAID DRUG PRICES, WE 
KNOW HOW IMPORTANT HEALTHCARE 
IS, DRUG PRICING IS EVEN MORE 
IMPORTANT FOR MY CONSTITUENTS. 
AT LONG LAST, THE DRUG 
COMPANIES IN FOREIGN COUNTRIES 
WILL BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE FOR 
HOW THEY READ THE SYSTEM 
AGAINST AMERICAN CONSUMERS. 
THIS IS A REVOLUTIONARY CHANGE, 
NOBODY HAS HAD THE COURAGE TO 
DO IT, OR THEY JUST DID NOT 
WANT TO DO IT. 
AND THIS IS A CHANGE FOR THE 
PEOPLE, NOT A CHANGE FOR 
INDUSTRY, OR FOR COMPANIES, OR 
FOR PHARMA, THIS IS A THE IT 
WILL BE SUBSTANTIALLY THEY 
REDUCTION IN DRUG PRICES FOR 
OUR PEOPLE, AND OUR SENIOR 
CITIZENS, TREMENDOUS DIFFERENCE.
OUR PLAN WILL ALSO FIX A BROKEN 
PAYMENT SYSTEM, WHERE DOCTORS 
ARE REIMBURSED MORE IF THEY 
PRESCRIBE A MUCH MORE EXPENSIVE 
DRUG, UNDER OUR NEW PROPOSED 
PAYMENT SYSTEM, DOCTORS WILL BE 
PAID A FLAT RATE, AND WHEN YOU 
THINK OF IT, IT'S LIKE BEING A 
CONTRACTOR, ANYTHING ELSE, IT'S 
IS A EXPENSIVE DRUG OR LESS 
EXPENSIVE DRUG, IT IS THE SAME, 
IT IS AN ANYMORE. 
I THINK THIS WILL BE GOOD IN 
TERMS OF THE PRICING OF THE 
DRUG, FANTASTIC FOR THAT, BUT 
ALSO MUCH BETTER FOR PATIENTS, 
AND IT MAY WELL BE BETTER FOR 
DOCTORS. 
THIS FOLLOWS OTHER SIGNIFICANT 
ACTIONS THAT WE HAVE TAKEN TO 
PROTECT MEDICARE, FOR OUR GREAT 
SENIORS. 
WE HAVE GIVEN THE PLANS THAT 
SERVE MORE THAN 45 MILLION 
SENIORS ON MEDICARE PART D, AND 
20 MILLION SENIORS ON MEDICARE 
ADVANTAGE, NEGOTIATING BETTER 
PRICES, THANKS TO OUR ACTIONS, 
PREMIUMS FOR MEDICARE PART D 
AND ADVANTAGE HAVE, I WILL GIVE 
YOUR WORD THAT YOU HAVEN'T EVER 
HEARD, HAVE GONE DOWN. 
YOU'VE NEVER HEARD THAT WORD.
>> 
>> TRUE, GONE DOWN, AND NOW 
THEY ARE GOING TO GO 
SUBSTANTIALLY DOWN. 
SADLY, A MAJORITY OF DEMOCRATS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
HAVE COSPONSORED A VERY 
SOCIALIST HEALTHCARE PLAN THAT 
WOULD DESTROY MEDICARE, 
TERMINATE MEDICARE ADVANTAGE, 
AND OUTLAW THE EMPLOYER-
SPONSORED HEALTH CARE PLANS OF 
157 MILLION AMERICANS, WE THINK 
THEY ARE ACTUALLY GOING TO COME 
ALONG WITH US WHEN THEY SEE 
WHAT WE ARE DOING, WE THINK, WE 
HOPE, IT IS SOMETHING THAT 
MAKES NO SENSE ANY OTHER WAY, 
WE REALLY THINK THAT COULD BE 
BIPARTISAN. 
THAT HAPPENED TO BE A DEMOCRAT 
THAT TOLD ME HOW IMPORTANT DRUG 
PRICING WAS, IT WASN'T A 
REPUBLICAN IN THIS CASE, IT WAS 
A DEMOCRAT.>>> UNDER THE SAID 
MINISTRATION, WE WILL ALWAYS 
PROTECT MEDICARE FOR OUR GREAT 
SENIORS, AND ALWAYS PROTECT 
AMERICANS WITH PRE-EXISTING 
CONDITIONS, ALWAYS. 
AND EVERY ACTION WE TAKE, WE 
ARE PUTTING AMERICA FIRST, THIS 
IS VERY MUCH ABOUT PUTTING 
AMERICA FIRST, WE GET TIRED OF 
HAVING PEOPLE GO TO OTHER 
COUNTRIES TO LITERALLY FILL 
PRESCRIPTIONS, YOU KNOW WHERE 
I'M TALKING ABOUT. 
WE ARE FIGHTING FOR LOWER DRUG 
PRICES, WHICH WILL NOW BE 
AUTOMATIC, AND VERY SUBSTANTIAL,
LOWER PREMIUMS, WHERE WE HAVE 
DONE A REALLY GOOD JOB WITH 
HEALTHCARE, RINGING THE 
PREMIUMS TO A LOWER LEVEL, A 
MORE ACCEPTABLE LEVEL, AND SOON 
ANNOUNCING SOME THINGS THAT 
WILL REALLY HAVE A TREMENDOUS 
AND POSITIVE IMPACT ON 
HEALTHCARE ALSO. 
AND BETTER HEALTHCARE, VERY 
IMPORTANTLY, FOR EVERY SINGLE 
AMERICAN. 
SO I JUST WANT TO THANK 
EVERYONE IN THIS ROOM, YOU ARE 
ASTOUNDING PEOPLE, I KNOW HOW 
HARD YOU WORK, I KNOW HOW 
IMPORTANT YOUR WORK IS, HOW 
BRILLIANT YOUR WORK HAS TO BE, 
AND HOW COMPLEX A JOB YOU HAVE, 
YOU HAVE EVERYTHING, PROBABLY 
EVERY SINGLE ELEMENT OF LIFE IN 
THE WORK YOU DO, BUT I WANT TO 
LET YOU KNOW, THE AMERICAN 
PEOPLE HAVE RESPECT FOR YOU. 
IT WILL GO VERY SIGNIFICANTLY, 
THEY ARE GOING TO SAY WHAT'S 
HAPPENED, THEY ARE GOING TO SAY 
WHAT A MISTAKE, IT'S TRUE, THEY 
WILL SAY DID YOU MAKE MISTAKE? 
SOMEONE SAY THAT, SOME MIGHT SAY
DID YOU MAKE A MISTAKE, YOU 
WILL SEE A BIG REDUCTION, I 
WANT TO THANK EVERYBODY VERY 
MUCH, IT'S AN HONOR TO BE HERE, 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH. 
>>   [ 
APPLAUSE ]
>> PRESIDENT TRUMP FOCUSING ON 
DRUG PRICES, SAYING IT'S 
IMPORTANT TO BRING THEM DOWN, 
WHILE COUNTRIES ARE PURCHASING 
DRUGS AT A CHEAPER RATE, HE 
WANTS THIS COUNTRY TO BE ABLE 
TO DO THE SAME. 
WE WILL TAKE A? BREAK, A LOT OF 
OTHER NEWS TO GET TO, STAY WITH 
US, TASH A QUICK BREAK. 
STAY WITH US -- A QUICK BREAK. 
YOU ARE WATCHING CBSN.
