a perfectly executed strike if we've learned one thing from Trump's tenure so far it's that he feels he can do as he pleases this week strikes on Syria are a textbook example of how far this can go to batter a sovereign country with over a hundred retaliatory missiles in response to a chemical attack you'd have to be a hundred percent sure that that attack happened instead America's conviction was built basically on online video and sources this conclusion is based on descriptions of the attack in multiple media sources the reported symptoms experienced by victims videos and images showing to assess barrel bombs from the attack and reliable information indicating coordination between Syrian military officials before the attack well my colleague Ken Delaney inand I have learned today that the u.s. now has blood and urine samples from some of the victims of this this attack in Syria last weekend and that those samples according to US officials tested positive for chemicals toxins samples verified witness and victim accounts provided by a un-backed chemical organization would have served as rock-solid proof but Trump apparently figured why bother launching the strikes just hours before the OPCW probe on the ground was scheduled to start experts are bound to proceed with the investigation anyway but in the face of the strikes they are presented with an additional challenge now holding up the very relevance of the probe another obligation for an attack of this kind UN approval but that's not a chapter of international law for Trump just a nuisance it is my duty to remind Member States that there is an obligation particularly when dealing with matters of peace and security to act consistently with the charter of the United Nations and with international law in general the UN Charter is very clear on these issues but even with the UN brushed aside the US Congress has to give the green light for the attack on paper it turns out the defense Secretary's promised to run the decision with the lawmakers was empty it is hard to find a legal justification for that military strike in Syria absent congressional approval so whatever you decide to do I would hope you would include the legislative branch we will be reporting to Congress and finally allies in ideal circumstances they'd be rallying unmask beside Washington unleashing their a joint Wrath on the enemy this time most US partners while giving their verbal supports have sought to avoid complicity AODA we must say as wheat aliens always have that if we need a long-term solution to the Syrian crisis we not only need to respond to crimes but first of all work towards peace touched on Germany will not take action I want to make it clear again that there are no decisions but we see and support this that everything is being done to send a signal that this use of chemical weapons is not acceptable none of the formal boxes checked but the mission is accomplished ignoring all the legalities and almost deliberately rushing headlong into war Trump has once again shown the only right way is his way you
