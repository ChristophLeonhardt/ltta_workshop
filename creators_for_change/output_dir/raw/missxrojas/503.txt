00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,989
every now then I have a look at my

channel<font color="#CCCCCC"> and just check out the step and</font>

3
00:00:02,820 --> 00:00:04,830
today I had look and noticed for the

first time how close I was to 10,000

5
00:00:06,899 --> 00:00:08,610
subscribers for which for having you to

6
00:00:08,610 --> 00:00:10,469
bank even if you haven't subscribed when

7
00:00:10,469 --> 00:00:12,509
I see comments from people who were

8
00:00:12,509 --> 00:00:13,650
commenting when I had a hundred

9
00:00:13,650 --> 00:00:15,299
subscribers and he was<font color="#E5E5E5"> still commenting</font>

10
00:00:15,299 --> 00:00:17,010
now I<font color="#E5E5E5"> just can't believe that you're</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">over the time of me having this YouTube</font>

13
00:00:21,779 --> 00:00:23,310
channel some things have changed to

14
00:00:23,310 --> 00:00:27,779
something substantive is filming in

15
00:00:27,779 --> 00:00:29,279
secret with a really crappy webcam

16
00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:31,500
talking<font color="#E5E5E5"> really quietly into a logitech</font>

17
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:33,239
microphone editing using free<font color="#E5E5E5"> software</font>

18
00:00:33,239 --> 00:00:35,370
which would leave a watermark on all my

00:00:35,370 --> 00:00:37,320
videos however<font color="#E5E5E5"> many colors my room goes</font>

20
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:39,000
through the one thing that is always

25
00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:48,300
changed that much there was so much new

26
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:50,160
talent the way that the publishing

27
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:51,780
industry in my country at least is

28
00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:53,160
functioning right now it should do

29
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:54,449
yourself a book so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think that there</font>

30

I just absolutely<font color="#CCCCCC"> adore it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> exciting to</font>

that you really like sometimes it does

68
00:02:09,209 --> 00:02:10,860
seem like<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're trapped within</font>

00:02:16,650 --> 00:02:18,450
one tell this person that they could

73
00:02:18,450 --> 00:02:20,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">change this and it makes me sound</font>

74
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:22,380
incredibly self righteous I think there

00:02:22,380 --> 00:02:23,400
are<font color="#CCCCCC"> a lot of books out there at the</font>

76
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:25,050

category at all it's a range of work as

80
00:02:31,050 --> 00:02:32,970
well this is not Tom had me hooked for

81
00:02:32,970 --> 00:02:35,100
such a long time during a sync my a

82
00:02:35,100 --> 00:02:37,410
levels so perhaps not the best timing I

00:02:37,410 --> 00:02:39,959
got into University say<font color="#CCCCCC"> pause</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> well you</font>

94
00:02:59,340 --> 00:03:01,920
interesting and fascinating more than
