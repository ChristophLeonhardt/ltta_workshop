I'm R.L. Stine and I write 
the "Goosebumps" books.
Well, I spend a lot of time in this room.
This is sort of my shrine to myself.
I try to have a lot of atmosphere
in my office in case kids come to visit.
As you can see I have a 
three-foot-long cockroach.
You don't see that very often
in too many offices.
I tell everyone that I caught it under 
the sink, but no one's believed me so far.
We moved every room in the apartment
to make room for the pool table,
and I was so excited 
to have my own pool table.
And I turned out to be horrible at it.
I'm just terrible.
I guess I just don't get the
geometry.
A designer who 
saw a picture frame
that was made with marbles 
like these shutters,
and she had the idea, 
she said, "Oh, look at the picture frame,
those would make great shutters."
We had those made
with the marbles in it,
and it's really quite remarkable.
It's lovely when the sun comes through.
And you can see I have two
ventriloquist dummies.
So, of course, Slappy the evil dummy 
is my most popular character.
And the other one looks just like
me. How weird is that?
