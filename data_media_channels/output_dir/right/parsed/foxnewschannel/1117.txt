LEADING UP TO THE ELECTION AND
THAT MAY BE BROADER THAN JUST
THE CLINTON EMAILS.
SANDRA?
>> Sandra: THANK YOU FOR YOUR
REPORTING ON THAT.
HERE IS LINDSEY GRAHAM, A MEMBER
OF THE SENATE JUDICIARY
COMMITTEE WHICH HAS OFTEN BEEN
AT THE CENTER OF GETTING TO THE
TRUTH OF ALL OF THIS.
THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME TONIGHT.
THEY ARE CLEARLY NEW QUESTIONS,
I SUPPOSE IT'S FAIR TO SAY, OVER
JAMES COMEY'S HANDLING OF EVENTS
SURROUNDING THE 2016 ELECTION.
>> I THINK -- WE WILL SEE WHAT
THE REPORT SAYS BUT I THOUGHT
DIRECTOR COMEY WAS SORT OF
OUT-OF-CONTROL BOUNCING FROM ONE
IDEA TO THE NEXT.
I WILL HOPE THAT THE REPORT WILL
LOOK AT THE FISA WARRANT ABUSE.
I HOPE THEY WILL TELL US HOW IT
BEING WOUND UP BEING USED TO GET
A WARRANT ON AN AMERICAN
CITIZEN, IN THIS DOSSIER STILL
UNVERIFIED TO THIS DAY.
SPEAK     AND >> Sandra: WE HAVE
SPEAK     AND >> Sandra: WE HAVH
SPEAK     AND >> Sandra: WE HAVA
SPEAK     AND >> Sandra: WE HAVD
SO MUCH FROM JAMES COMEY, AS YOU
JUST REFERENCE.
HE WAS ON HIS BOOK TOUR AND
ACROSS VARIOUS NETWORKS AND
PUBLICATIONS, IT WAS HARD TO
MISS HIM.
WE HAVEN'T SEEN MUCH OF HIM AND
NOW TO LEARN THAT HE IS THE
FOCUS OF THIS IG INVESTIGATION,
WHAT SHOULD THAT TELL US?
>> WHILE I THINK THE IG HAS
LOOKED AT HIS LEADERSHIP MODEL
AND FOUND IT LACKING.
WE BELIEVE THERE WAS SOME
INTELLIGENCE COMPROMISING THE
ATTORNEY GENERAL LORETTA LYNCH.
ALL I CAN SAY IS THAT THE TWO
FBI -- PETER STROKE AND PAGE
PACE, THEY WERE IN CHARGE OF THE
CLINTON EMAIL INVESTIGATION.
IF YOU TRUST THESE TWO, YOU ARE
CRAZY.
LOOK AT THE EMAIL CHAIN BETWEEN
THEM.
I THINK THE DEPARTMENT OF
JUSTICE WAS IN THE TANK FOR
CLINTON.
THE FBI DID NOT DO A VERY
GOOD JOB OF LOOKING AT THE
CLINTON EMAIL INVESTIGATION.
IT WAS A SHAM INVESTIGATION.
IN THE EARLY STAGES OF THE
RUSSIA INVESTIGATION, THE
DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE WAS USING
MATERIAL PROVIDED TO THEM BY A
FOREIGN AGENT, A FORMER BRITISH
AGENT, PAID FOR BY THE
DEMOCRATIC PARTY.
SO THERE IS A LOT TO LOOK AT
HERE.
>> THERE WAS A REPUBLICAN MEMO,
AND THE ANTICIPATION IS BUILDING
BY THE DAY TO FINALLY SEE THIS
INSPECTOR GENERAL REPORT.
WE HAVE SEEN, AND IN THIS CASE,
PERHAPS IT IS VERY CRITICAL OF
JAMES COMEY.
PERHAPS DEMOCRATS DON'T LIKE IT.
THEY COULD DISCOUNT IT, WE HAVE
SEEN THAT HAPPEN IN THE PAST.
WHAT IS DIFFERENT ABOUT THIS
INSPECTOR GENERAL REPORT AS THE
AMERICAN PEOPLE ARE TOLD THAT IT
IS SO HIGHLY ANTICIPATED BY
MEMBERS OF CONGRESS AND BEYOND?
>> NUMBER ONE, IT'S NOT A
REPUBLICAN REPORT OR A DEMOCRAT
REPORT.
HE IS HIGHLY RESPECTED AND IS
VIEWED AS A STRAIGHT SHOOTER.
AND TO CALL OUT ABUSES FOR THE
FBI, I THINK IT WILL HAVE
CREDIBILITY BECAUSE OF WHO HE IS
AND THE PERSON HE IS.
THE FBI AGENT IN CHARGE OF THE
CLINTON EMAIL INVESTIGATION
ACTED OUT-OF-BOUNDS.
THERE IS A BREACH OF THE LAW
WHEN IT CAME TO MR. STEELE AND
HOW HE WAS USED AS A
CONFIDENTIAL INFORMANT.
MR. ORR, THE NUMBER FOUR IN
CHARGE OF THE G
CHARGE OF THE G       THAT, THEE
MR. ORR, THE NUMBER FOUR IN
CHARGE OF THE G       THAT, THEA
CHARGE OF THE G       THAT, THEE
CHARGE OF THE G       THAT, THEA
CHARGE OF THE G       THAT, THEL
CHARGE OF THE G       THAT, THET
OF BAD SITUATIONS HERE AND I
WOULD LIKE TO SEE A SPECIAL
COUNSEL LOOK AT THIS NOT JUST
FROM AN INTERNAL POINT OF VIEW
ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT CRIMES WERE
COMMITTED.
>> Sandra: MEANWHILE YOU HAVE
BEEN A CRITIC OF ROBERT
ROSENSTEIN, OVERSEEING THE
SPECIAL COUNSEL INVESTIGATION.
YOU HAVE SAID HE IS CONFLICTED
AND, THOSE ARE YOUR WORDS.
HE WROTE A LETTER SAYING HE
NEEDS TO RECUSE HIMSELF.
HE RECEIVED A LETTER BACK AND
YOU ARE GOING TO SHARE WITH US
WHAT YOU HEARD BACK TONIGHT.
>> ONE, IT DIDN'T COME FROM HIM,
IT CAME FROM THE LEGISLATIVE
SECTION OF THE DEPARTMENT OF
JUSTICE, NOT FROM
MR. ROSENSTEIN.
HE IS A FINE MAN, IT'S NOT THAT
I DOUBT HIS CHARACTER OR
QUALIFICATIONS.
THE PROBLEM I HAVE IS, I BELIEVE
HE WILL BE A WITNESS IN ANY
OBSTRUCTION OF JUSTICE
INVESTIGATION CONDUCTED BY MR.
MR. MOELLER.
HE'S THE ONE THAT WROTE THE MEMO
TO PRESIDENT TRUMP SUGGESTING
WHY MR. COMEY SHOULD BE FIRED.
HE'S ALSO IN THE FISA WARRANT
THAT WAS ISSUED BASED ON A
DOSSIER COMING FROM A FOREIGN
AGENT WHO WENT TO RUSSIA, PAID
FOR BY THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY.
I DON'T KNOW HOW YOU COULD LOOK
AT THAT ASPECT OF THIS CASE.
TO ME, HE SEEMS TO BE
CONFLICTED.
I DIDN'T GET A VERY GOOD ANSWER
AS TO WHY.
>> WHAT WAS IT?
>> IT WAS GOBBLEDYGOOK.
I JUST DON'T KNOW HOW MR. MULLEN
ROSENSTEIN IS NOT PART OF THE
WITNESS CHANGE.
CHAIN.
MAYBE I'M WRONG, BUT THE LETTER
DID NOT ANSWER MY QUESTION.
I'M NOT GOING TO GIVE UP ON
THIS, I TRY TO MAKE SURE THAT HE
CAN DO HIS JOB WITHOUT
INTERFERENCE BUT IT REALLY DOES
BOTHER ME THAT MR. ROSENSTEIN
HAS NOT APPOINTED A SPECIAL
COUNSEL LOOK AT THE DOJ AND FBI
ABUSES.
AND CAN HE OVERSEE THE MUELLER
INVESTIGATION GIVEN THE ROLE HE
PLAYED?
>> ARE YOU GOING TO CONTINUE
WITH THAT?
>> ABSOLUTELY.
>> Sandra: MEANWHILE, THE
PRESIDENT'S LAWYER, RUDY
GIULIANI COMPANIES TRYING TO GO
FURTHER SAYING THEY ARE TRYING
TO BRING THE PRESIDENT.
HE SAID THIS.
LISTEN.
>> A GROUP OF 13 HIGHLY PARTISAN
DEMOCRATS THAT MAKE UP THE
MUELLER, EXCLUDING HIM --
MUELLER TEAM, EXCLUDING HIM,
TRYING TO GET HIM IN TROUBLE
WHEN HE HASN'T DONE ANYTHING
WRONG.
>> Sandra: WHAT DO YOU THINK
OF THAT, SENATOR?
IT APPEARS THAT WE HAVE LOST THE
SENATOR.
THAT HAPPENS SOMETIMES WITH LIVE
TV, WE WILL TRY TO GET HIM BACK
IF WE CAN.
OKAY, SENATOR, CAN YOU HEAR ME?
ALL RIGHT, THE BEAUTY AND JOY OF
LIVE TELEVISIONS.
>> IT WAS THE RUSSIANS, THEY ARE
TRYING TO KNOCK ME OFF THE AIR.
RUDY, ALL I CAN SAY IS HE'S
PITCHING FOR THE PRESIDENT AND
HE IS GOOD LAWYER.
LET'S SEE WHAT HE FINDS IS HIS
JOB TO PUSH BACK AGAINST THE
LEGISLATION.
TIME WILL TELL AND WE WILL SEE
WHAT KIND OF REPORT THEY HAVE.
I SEE NO EVIDENCE THAT THE
PRESIDENT WAS INVOLVED WITH THE
RUSSIANS.
>> IS INTERESTING TO HEAR, THE
ATTORNEY TRYING TO FRAME THE
PRESIDENT.
AND I KNOW YOU ARE AT THE
WHITE HOUSE TODAY.
YOU MET WITH THE PRESIDENT, AND
TALKED ABOUT TRADE.
WHILE THAT WAS HAPPENING, I HAVE
TO TELL YOU THAT THERE ARE NEW
REPORTS OF AMERICAN DIPLOMATS.
WHILE YOU WERE IN THAT MEETING,
THESE REPORTS COMING OUT.
NEW DIPLOMATS FALLING ILL IN
CHINA AFTER HEARING ODD NOISES,
THEY ARE REPORTING.
THEY HAVE BEEN EVACUATED, THE
STATE APART MAKE OUT THEM OUT OF
THERE.
BUT WE SAW A SIMILAR EVENT IN
FLORIDA.
LET'S GET YOUR RESPONSE TONIGHT.
>> I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT'S
HAPPENING AROUND THE WORLD BUT
SOMEBODY IS TRYING TO HURT OUR
PEOPLE.
IN CUBA, I DON'T BELIEVE IT
HAPPENED WITHOUT THEIR
KNOWLEDGE.
SECRETARY POMPEO IS VERY
CONCERNED ABOUT THIS AND SO AM
I.
I'M VERY CONCERNED AND I'M IN
CHARGE OF THE OVERSIGHT OF OUR
STATE DEPARTMENT, AND THEY SERVE
OUR COUNTRY AND VERY DANGEROUS
PLACES LIKE THE MILITARY.
THIS MEETING WITH THE PRESIDENT,
HERE'S MY TAKE AWAY.
PRESIDENT HAS A PLAN TO GET US
BETTER TRADE DEALS THROUGHOUT
THE WORLD INCLUDING OUR OWN
BACKYARD.
HE HAS A PLAN TO GET A BETTER
DEAL WITH CANADA AND MEXICO AND
I'M NOT GOING TO DO ANYTHING TO
UNDERCUT THE PRESIDENT'S ABILITY
TO NEGOTIATE A BETTER TRADE
DEAL.
SO I DON'T THINK NOW IS THE TIME
TO DO THAT.
THE PRESIDENT IS PUSHING BACK
AGAINST CHINA, SOMEBODY SHOULD
HAVE DONE IT A LONG TIME AGO.
THERE WAS A PLAN IN PLACE THAT
