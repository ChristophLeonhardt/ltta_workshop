1
00:00:05,629 --> 00:00:08,832
>> HOW BAD IS MICHAEL AVENATTI

2
00:00:08,833 --> 00:00:11,968
HIS LAWYERS ARE BAD.

3
00:00:11,969 --> 00:00:15,071
A CALIFORNIA JUDGE DISMISSED

4
00:00:15,072 --> 00:00:17,207
STORMY DANIEL'S DEFAMATION SUIT

5
00:00:17,208 --> 00:00:19,409
AND ORDERED HER TO PLAY TRUMP'S

6
00:00:19,410 --> 00:00:20,210
LEGAL FEES.

7
00:00:20,211 --> 00:00:22,011
NOW WHEN JUDGES DO THAT IT'S TO

8
00:00:22,012 --> 00:00:23,313
SEND A MESSAGE.

9
00:00:23,314 --> 00:00:26,416
YOUR LAWYER'S A MORON.

10
00:00:26,417 --> 00:00:28,785
POOR STORMY, AS A RULE PEOPLE

11
00:00:28,786 --> 00:00:33,456
PAY HER FOR SEX AND NOW AVENATTI

12
00:00:33,457 --> 00:00:35,458
REVERSED IT.

13
00:00:35,459 --> 00:00:37,393
HE CHASED SPOT LIGHTS AN WHEN HE

14
00:00:37,394 --> 00:00:39,929
CATCHES THEM HE LOOKS

15
00:00:39,930 --> 00:00:40,330
RIDICULOUS.

16
00:00:40,331 --> 00:00:41,631
HE'S GOOD AT COSTING HIS OWN

17
00:00:41,632 --> 00:00:42,499
SIDE MONEY.

18
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:44,467
HIS FIRM WAS ORDER TO PAY $10

19
00:00:44,468 --> 00:00:48,571
MILLION TO AN ATTORNEY WHO ONCE

20
00:00:48,572 --> 00:01:00,650
WORKED THERE AND WHAT ABOUT THE

21
00:01:00,651 --> 00:01:03,253
KAVANAUGH DEBACLE AND MANY FLED

22
00:01:03,254 --> 00:01:05,188
SENSING THEY WERE BECOMING HIS

23
00:01:05,188 --> 00:01:07,857
VICTIMS TOO.

24
00:01:07,858 --> 00:01:08,658
WHY COMPLAIN.

25
00:01:08,659 --> 00:01:10,193
SHE'S BAIN DISASTER FOR THE

26
00:01:10,194 --> 00:01:10,560
DEMOCRATS.

27
00:01:10,561 --> 00:01:12,829
ARE WE SURE HE WASN'T ON TRUMP'S

28
00:01:12,830 --> 00:01:13,730
PAYROLL ALL ALONG.

29
00:01:13,731 --> 00:01:16,032
NOW HE'S TAKEN TO CHALLENGING

30
00:01:16,033 --> 00:01:18,434
PEOPLE TO FIGHT ON TWITTER LIKE

31
00:01:18,435 --> 00:01:23,206
A TOWN-

32
00:01:23,207 --> 00:01:23,540
A TOW POLUCA.

33
00:01:23,541 --> 00:01:25,808
HOW DOES THE TRICKSTER GET AWAY

34
00:01:25,809 --> 00:01:26,743
WITH IT?

35
00:01:26,744 --> 00:01:29,112
DOES THE STATE BAR CARE ABOUT

36
00:01:29,113 --> 00:01:29,445
ETHICS.

37
00:01:29,446 --> 00:01:30,980
ISN'T THERE A DISCIPLINARY

38
00:01:30,981 --> 00:01:32,649
COMMITTEE OR IS HE EXEMPT

39
00:01:32,650 --> 00:01:34,951
BECAUSE HE'S A LIBERAL ATTACK

40
00:01:34,952 --> 00:01:35,218
DOG.

41
00:01:35,219 --> 00:01:37,587
HIS PUNISHMENT SHOULD BE HARSH.

42
00:01:37,588 --> 00:01:39,822
MAKE HIM REPRESENT HIMSELF.

43
00:01:39,823 --> 00:01:42,258
HE'S GOING TO RUN, DANA.

44
00:01:42,259 --> 00:01:47,096
>> HE IS RUNNING.

45
00:01:47,097 --> 00:01:49,232
MAYBE THIS COULD BE GREET FOR

46
00:01:49,233 --> 00:01:49,499
HIM.

47
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:51,367
MAYBE HE DOESN'T CARE.

48
00:01:51,368 --> 00:01:53,069
>> HE DOES PROVIDE A LOT OF

49
00:01:53,070 --> 00:01:53,403
FODDER.

50
00:01:53,404 --> 00:01:55,471
I'M SURE THE DEMOCRATS WISH HE

51
00:01:55,472 --> 00:01:58,174
WOULD JUST GO AWAY OR BECOME A

52
00:01:58,175 --> 00:01:58,575
REPUBLICAN.

53
00:01:58,576 --> 00:01:59,475
>> HE COULD RUN WITH LIZ.

54
00:01:59,476 --> 00:02:00,443
WHAT A TICKET.

55
00:02:00,444 --> 00:02:04,514
>> THEY CAN COME UP WITH OTHER

56
00:02:04,515 --> 00:02:04,814
IDEA.

57
00:02:04,815 --> 00:02:07,750
I DO WONDER IF AVENATTI WILL

58
00:02:07,751 --> 00:02:10,153
HELP STORMY DANIELS PAY THE

59
00:02:10,154 --> 00:02:11,120
LEGAL FEES.

60
00:02:11,121 --> 00:02:15,258
>> HER GO FUND ME PAGE WHICH IS

61
00:02:15,259 --> 00:02:21,531
FLOODED WITH MONEY WITH PEOPLE

62
00:02:21,532 --> 00:02:23,800
WHO HATE TRUMP WILL GO TO TRUMP.

63
00:02:23,801 --> 00:02:29,606
>> TRUMP ALWAYS MAKES MONEY.

64
00:02:29,607 --> 00:02:30,974
>> I THINK THE DEMOCRATS HAVE

65
00:02:30,975 --> 00:02:34,510
HITCHED THEIR RIDE TO THE WRONG

66
00:02:34,511 --> 00:02:34,811
HORSE.

67
00:02:34,812 --> 00:02:36,646
HE'S TAKEN THE DEMOCRATS FOR A

68
00:02:36,647 --> 00:02:38,948
RIDE AND IT WON'T BE A VICTORY

69
00:02:38,949 --> 00:02:39,215
LAP.

70
00:02:39,216 --> 00:02:40,650
THE PRESIDENT OBVIOUSLY SAID

71
00:02:40,651 --> 00:02:42,852
SHE'S A HORSEFACE OR WHATEVER ON

72
00:02:42,853 --> 00:02:44,087
TWITTER AND NOW ANYBODY ON THE

73
00:02:44,088 --> 00:02:44,821
LEFT IS UPSET.

74
00:02:44,822 --> 00:02:46,189
I WOULDN'T SAY THAT BUT HERE'S

75
00:02:46,190 --> 00:02:48,591
WHAT I WOULD SAY, THE LEFT HAS

76
00:02:48,592 --> 00:02:50,593
USED THE WORD "C" WORD TO

77
00:02:50,594 --> 00:02:51,694
DESCRIBE PEOPLE IN THE TRUMP

78
00:02:51,695 --> 00:02:54,430
FAMILY AND EVERYBODY APPLAUDED

79
00:02:54,431 --> 00:02:55,231
THAT.

80
00:02:55,232 --> 00:03:00,570
THEY FANTASIZED ABOUT KILLING

81
00:03:00,571 --> 00:03:02,338
THE PRESIDENT AND NOW THEY'RE

82
00:03:02,339 --> 00:03:04,073
CLUTCHING THEIR PEARLS WHEN THE

83
00:03:04,074 --> 00:03:10,146
PRESIDENT SAYS THE WORD "HORSE

84
00:03:10,147 --> 00:03:11,014
FACE"?

85
00:03:11,015 --> 00:03:15,685
PLEASE, YOU'RE SURPRISED DONALD

86
00:03:15,686 --> 00:03:17,053
TRUMP SAYS THING ABOUT PEOPLE,

87
00:03:17,054 --> 00:03:18,154
EITHER YOU HAVEN'T LEARNED

88
00:03:18,155 --> 00:03:19,122
ANYTHING OR YOUR DENSE.

89
00:03:19,123 --> 00:03:20,990
THIS IS WHAT HE DOES AND HOW HE

90
00:03:20,991 --> 00:03:21,290
WINS.

91
00:03:21,291 --> 00:03:23,126
NOW REGARDING THE OTHER CLAIM

92
00:03:23,127 --> 00:03:25,828
ABOUT THE GANG RAPE CASE, THAT

93
00:03:25,829 --> 00:03:28,364
BEING SO FALSE IN AND OF ITSELF

94
00:03:28,365 --> 00:03:31,601
MAKES ME THINK MAYBE DONALD

95
00:03:31,602 --> 00:03:33,069
TRUMP DIDN'T HAVE AN AFFAIR WITH

96
00:03:33,070 --> 00:03:33,903
STORMY DANIELS.

97
00:03:33,904 --> 00:03:37,073
>> I WOULD SAY THAT STORMY

98
00:03:37,074 --> 00:03:40,276
DANIELS HAVE ALSO SAID NOT SO

99
00:03:40,277 --> 00:03:41,577
NICE THING ABOUT PRESIDENT

100
00:03:41,578 --> 00:03:43,279
TRUMP'S EXPERIENCE.

101
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:48,451
THERE'S THINGS WE WILL NOT

102
00:03:48,452 --> 00:03:48,785
REPEAT.

103
00:03:48,786 --> 00:03:50,119
AVENATTI 2020 WILL BE LIT AS THE

104
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:52,121
KIDS SAY AND I THINK HE'LL BE

105
00:03:52,122 --> 00:03:53,089
UPSET HE WAS INVOLVED.

106
00:03:53,090 --> 00:03:54,891
THEY THINK THE REASON THEY LOST

107
00:03:54,892 --> 00:04:02,498
THE KAVANAUGH FIGHT IS HE GOT

108
00:04:02,499 --> 00:04:03,900
INVOLVED AND PUTTING STORMY

109
00:04:03,901 --> 00:04:06,069
DANIELS IN A POSITION WHERE HE

110
00:04:06,070 --> 00:04:07,370
WON'T PAY THE LEGAL BILLS FOR

111
00:04:07,371 --> 00:04:08,771
HER AND WILL FIND SOME OTHER

112
00:04:08,772 --> 00:04:12,709
WOMAN TO JUMP INTO THIS TRAP OF

113
00:04:12,710 --> 00:04:14,077
POLITICS CLAIMING HE WILL

114
00:04:14,078 --> 00:04:15,011
REPRESENT HER AND IT WILL BE

115
00:04:15,012 --> 00:04:17,113
GREAT, THEY'RE GOING TO WIN AND

116
00:04:17,113 --> 00:04:18,714
YET HIS TRACK RECORD SHOWS THE

117
00:04:18,716 --> 00:04:19,248
OPPOSITE.

118
00:04:19,249 --> 00:04:21,117
IT'S NOT FOR WOMEN GETTING

119
00:04:21,118 --> 00:04:22,852
INVOLVED, WARNING, YOU SEE HIM

120
00:04:22,853 --> 00:04:25,488
KNOCKING ON YOUR DOOR, TELL HIM

121
00:04:25,489 --> 00:04:26,022
TO GO AWAY.

122
00:04:26,023 --> 00:04:29,692
WHEN IT COMES TO COMPLICATIONS

123
00:04:29,693 --> 00:04:33,696
FOR WHAT HE'S DONE --

124
00:04:33,697 --> 00:04:37,934
>> WELL, THE KIDS SAY HIS

125
00:04:37,935 --> 00:04:38,901
CAMPAIGN IS LIT?

126
00:04:38,902 --> 00:04:40,036
>> LIT.

127
00:04:40,037 --> 00:04:41,170
LIKE ON FIRE.

128
00:04:41,171 --> 00:04:43,072
IT'S GOING TO BE EXCITING TO

129
00:04:43,073 --> 00:04:43,473
WATCH.

130
00:04:43,474 --> 00:04:46,442
>> I THINK DANA AND GREG HAD IT

131
00:04:46,443 --> 00:04:46,743
RIGHT.

132
00:04:46,744 --> 00:04:48,678
IT WILL BE FUN FOR US.

133
00:04:48,679 --> 00:04:50,680
>> THAT'S WHAT I MEAN.

134
00:04:50,681 --> 00:04:54,050
>> TO ME THE HORSE FACE STUFF,

135
00:04:54,051 --> 00:04:58,387
BY THE WAY, COME ON.

136
00:04:58,388 --> 00:05:02,391
YOU SAY IT'S TYPICAL TRUMP BUT

137
00:05:02,392 --> 00:05:05,094
CARLY FIORINA AND I THINK, MAN,

138
00:05:05,095 --> 00:05:06,629
AT SOME POINT AMERICAN WOMEN ARE

139
00:05:06,630 --> 00:05:10,933
LIKE THIS GUY'S --

140
00:05:10,934 --> 00:05:12,034
>> AND SOMETHING ABOUT IMPORTANT

141
00:05:12,035 --> 00:05:12,335
STARS.

142
00:05:12,336 --> 00:05:13,035
>> I SEE.

143
00:05:13,036 --> 00:05:15,571
I THINK IT'S ALL WOMAN IN TERMS

144
00:05:15,572 --> 00:05:16,439
OF HIS ATTITUDE.

145
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:18,374
I THINK THE REAL INTERESTING

146
00:05:18,375 --> 00:05:20,076
THING HERE IS HOW THE RIGHT IS

147
00:05:20,077 --> 00:05:22,812
MAKING THIS OUT TO BE SUCH A BIG

148
00:05:22,813 --> 00:05:23,412
WIN.

149
00:05:23,413 --> 00:05:25,515
TOTAL VINDICATION FOR DONALD

150
00:05:25,516 --> 00:05:26,849
TRUMP WHEN THIS ISN'T THE MAIN

151
00:05:26,850 --> 00:05:27,150
CASE.

152
00:05:27,151 --> 00:05:29,685
THE MAIN CASE HAS TO DO WITH THE

153
00:05:29,686 --> 00:05:30,386
NON-DISCLOSURE AGREEMENT.

154
00:05:30,387 --> 00:05:31,854
THIS WAS ABOUT THE UNKNOWN GUY

155
00:05:31,855 --> 00:05:36,192
IN THE PARKING LOT --

156
00:05:36,193 --> 00:05:37,527
>> DO YOU THINK PEOPLE CARE

157
00:05:37,528 --> 00:05:39,495
ABOUT THE NON-DISCLOSURE?

158
00:05:39,496 --> 00:05:42,498
>> MY POINT TO YOU IS THIS CASE

159
00:05:42,499 --> 00:05:43,332
IS NOT SETTLED.

160
00:05:43,333 --> 00:05:46,536
>> HERE'S THE ISSUE, THIS WAS

161
00:05:46,537 --> 00:05:52,375
THE CASE THEY JUST WON WAS

162
00:05:52,376 --> 00:05:53,709
PROBABLY THE STRONGEST ONE

163
00:05:53,710 --> 00:05:55,912
BECAUSE TO YOUR POINT ABOUT THE

164
00:05:55,913 --> 00:05:56,813
HUSH AGREEMENT SHE TOOK THE

165
00:05:56,814 --> 00:05:57,113
MONEY.

166
00:05:57,114 --> 00:06:00,082
IT WILL BE HARD FOR HER TO BE

167
00:06:00,083 --> 00:06:01,384
PROVEN TO BE RIGHT IF SHE'D

168
00:06:01,385 --> 00:06:03,052
TAKEN THE MONEY.

169
00:06:03,053 --> 00:06:05,154
>> SHE SAID IN FACT IT WASN'T

170
00:06:05,155 --> 00:06:06,956
PROPERLY SIGNED AND MICHAEL

171
00:06:06,957 --> 00:06:09,192
COHEN WHO NOW -- I DON'T KNOW

172
00:06:09,193 --> 00:06:14,730
WHERE HE STANDS -- THIS IS WHERE

173
00:06:14,731 --> 00:06:16,866
THE CONVERSATION -- NOT ONLY

174
00:06:16,867 --> 00:06:21,337
HERE BUT IN AMERICA HAS GONE.

175
00:06:21,338 --> 00:06:24,974
MICHAEL AVENATTI HAD A

176
00:06:24,975 --> 00:00:00,000
RELATIONSHIP?
