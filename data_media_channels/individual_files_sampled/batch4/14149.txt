now Chartres is the Member of Parliament for Bradford West she represents the Labour Party so it should come as no surprise that she's a racist extremist the Labour Party's become the new nasty party hasn't it I mean sure they're sticking to their age-old principle of just spending money we don't have to provide free things to as many people as possible but as Britain's demographics have shifted over the last couple of decades the party's begun this whole new policy of appeasement of a religious minority who have nefarious agendas now Chartres epitomizes this transformation very well indeed she's one of the most extreme members of parliament that we have and in just three years in the house she's been temporarily suspended from her party and stirred up a number of national controversies that showed just how hateful nasty mean-spirited and self-serving she is which makes sense I mean if anyone was going to take the Bradford West seat from George Galloway who called the constituency his Bradford Spring after he won the Bayeux action in 2012 it was gonna be another radical gala we got over 18,000 people to vote for him in this largely Muslim area this man has an interesting history when it comes to Judaism in Israel as well so for labour to win in the 2015 election they had to choose someone who could play him at his own game and sure did exactly that and then some as soon as Chartres was elected she was contacted by a Christian convert from Islam called nazar Hussein and I met him last year he stopped shocking after left Islam his family was subject to vicious anti-christian abuse they were regularly threatened and intimidated and CCTV footage shows miss hour being beaten up by a gang of Muslim men outside his own house this resulted in this AR and his family being escorted out of their home in the middle of the night by armed police and relocated to a new safe house and when this are contacted sha his MP to arrange a meeting to discuss it it was shunned Sharan her aide Mohammed shibir who previously had worked with MP George Galloway ignored nazar after making empty comments and promises to the press she said something but then just ignored nazar in his family in fact she told ITV News that support had been provided to this arts family but no such support came and in 2016 blogger Paul stains found a Facebook post from shower in 2014 which supported the relocation of the State of Israel to the US sharra also compared Israeli policies to Nazi Germany policies and she admitted herself that her words were anti-semitic though no doubt only after the Labor Party put the boot in and told her to be less obvious about it on the 26 of April 2016 shall step down as the private secretary to Shadow Chancellor John McDonald the day after she was suspended from the Labor Party and surely that would have been that but no shower only resigned from her job in the Labor Party she didn't resign from her position as Member of Parliament for Bradford West presumably because she knew very well that the Labour Party would just take her back and they did she was reinstated on the 5th of July after a meeting with the party's Executive Committee she was given just a slap on the wrist and once again give him free rein to be the nasty piece of work that she is and in 2017 after being reelected she liked him retweeted a post from an Owen Jones parody account the tweet called on the abused girls in Rotherham to shut their mouths for the sake of diversity she told the press that it was an accident but we all know that's a lie I mean this is no slip of the finger she chose to light the tweet and then chose to click an entirely separate button that retweeted the tweet this is who she is and this is what she thinks and you'd think she'd have learned her lesson by then but no after hearing the political extremists Winnie Mandela had died remember this is a woman who endorsed burning alleged police informers alive with tires around their bodies in a practice known as necklacing she retweeted a post that joked about this gruesome form of murder and she wasn't the only one to praise Winnie Mandela despite her involvement in multiple murders professional victim after a Hearst lauded Mandela claiming if she had been white there would be no debate about her being a hero but that's rubbish if she were white the press will be reporting on the death of a terrorist political extremists on a murderer siya is the nasty face of anti English politics in Britain she isn't unique though she's just not particularly good at hiding it and with all these nasty comments serious political controversies and her butt littering of the victims of Muslim rape gangs in rather room and her joking about the burning of people alive using rubber tires this should surely be enough for this horrible woman to resign or at least for the Labour Party to permanently suspend her and call for her resignation as a member of parliament but with Corbin's track record and his appeasement of a violent religious minority I think that NASA has a bright future the new nasty party shower isn't going away but she does need to be exposed it's time that this woman face real political pressure to step down apologize to the victim she mocked and faced the full weight of the racial and religious hatred legislation that her party so fervently endorses watch me and the rest of the rebel team on our brand new app download it now from the Google Play Store and the Apple App Store you
