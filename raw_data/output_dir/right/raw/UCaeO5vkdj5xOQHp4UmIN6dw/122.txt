1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,029
- [Audience Member] Big
Ben, what's up with you?

2
00:00:01,029 --> 00:00:02,663
- [Ben] How's it going, dude?

3
00:00:02,663 --> 00:00:04,496
- Hey, I'm doing alright.

4
00:00:04,496 --> 00:00:07,217
(applause)

5
00:00:07,217 --> 00:00:10,091
Okay, so my question is, well
first I'm going to kind of--

6
00:00:10,091 --> 00:00:13,044
- I need to give you this
hammer. You're enormous, dude.

7
00:00:13,044 --> 00:00:14,470
You can wield this much better than I can.

8
00:00:14,470 --> 00:00:17,577
I look like one of the
dwarves from Snow White

9
00:00:17,577 --> 00:00:19,741
and the Seven Dwarves, like
I'm going mining or something.

10
00:00:19,741 --> 00:00:20,574
- Appreciate that.

11
00:00:20,574 --> 00:00:24,367
So, first, I want to
paraphrase another speaker,

12
00:00:24,367 --> 00:00:27,426
who kind of operates along your same tone,

13
00:00:27,426 --> 00:00:28,690
in America, Jordan Peterson,

14
00:00:28,690 --> 00:00:30,476
Dr. Jordan Peterson.

15
00:00:30,476 --> 00:00:33,476
(audience applause)

16
00:00:34,756 --> 00:00:38,650
So, one of the things that
he often talks about is

17
00:00:38,650 --> 00:00:43,163
at the basis, or the premise
of the ongoing debate

18
00:00:43,163 --> 00:00:47,156
between conservatism versus
liberalism is that at the basis

19
00:00:47,156 --> 00:00:49,156
of each, conservatism is

20
00:00:51,223 --> 00:00:52,806
like the protection

21
00:00:54,261 --> 00:00:56,806
of the hierarchy whereas
on the liberal side,

22
00:00:56,806 --> 00:01:00,560
it is more so protection and
promotion of egalitarianism.

23
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:04,666
And so, my question to you
is: one thing he makes clear

24
00:01:04,666 --> 00:01:08,038
is that both sides are necessary for

25
00:01:08,038 --> 00:01:11,177
or are ideal in a country
that moves forward

26
00:01:11,177 --> 00:01:15,023
at a fast pace as the
United States has done.

27
00:01:15,023 --> 00:01:17,271
And so my question to you
is, it seems as though

28
00:01:17,271 --> 00:01:20,429
you have a more hostile,
you have such a hostility

29
00:01:20,429 --> 00:01:22,929
towards liberals and leftists.

30
00:01:24,540 --> 00:01:27,565
Whereas I don't often hear you at all,

31
00:01:27,565 --> 00:01:30,667
say there is anything you
can learn from their side.

32
00:01:30,667 --> 00:01:31,878
In his book, "Twelve Rules for Life",

33
00:01:31,878 --> 00:01:34,150
one of the chapters is
assume that the person

34
00:01:34,150 --> 00:01:34,983
in which you are speaking with has

35
00:01:34,983 --> 00:01:36,974
something to offer you,

36
00:01:36,974 --> 00:01:39,497
as far as intellectually
that you may learn from them.

37
00:01:39,497 --> 00:01:41,643
So my question to you is, I guess

38
00:01:41,643 --> 00:01:43,884
what is your position,

39
00:01:43,884 --> 00:01:47,467
do you feel as though a
liberal, or obviously a liberal,

40
00:01:47,467 --> 00:01:50,261
but liberals in general
or leftists in general

41
00:01:50,261 --> 00:01:52,169
have anything to bring
anything to the table,

42
00:01:52,169 --> 00:01:53,884
from an ideology standpoint
or intellectually?

43
00:01:53,884 --> 00:01:56,368
- I mean passion for change is obviously,

44
00:01:56,368 --> 00:01:58,255
it can be a good thing when
directed in the proper channels.

45
00:01:58,255 --> 00:02:02,548
As you say, the left focus
on egalitarianism is good

46
00:02:02,548 --> 00:02:06,260
so long as it is focused on
the equal application of rights

47
00:02:06,260 --> 00:02:10,276
not on the false attempts
to override biology

48
00:02:10,276 --> 00:02:11,310
and natural hierarchy.

49
00:02:11,310 --> 00:02:13,932
So, I think Jordan would
agree with me on the idea that

50
00:02:13,932 --> 00:02:16,763
if you run up, if you butt up
against a natural hierarchy

51
00:02:16,763 --> 00:02:18,782
or if you butt up against
natural differences

52
00:02:18,782 --> 00:02:20,676
because I don't think ever
difference is a hierarchy.

53
00:02:20,676 --> 00:02:22,287
If you butt up against
natural differences,

54
00:02:22,287 --> 00:02:24,162
if you butt up against
reality, trying to override

55
00:02:24,162 --> 00:02:26,576
reality with artificial
equality is going to be

56
00:02:26,576 --> 00:02:29,364
a giant failure and can,
as Jordan would say,

57
00:02:29,364 --> 00:02:30,969
murder millions in the process.

58
00:02:30,969 --> 00:02:32,611
Right, it's what Jordan
thinks Communism was.

59
00:02:32,611 --> 00:02:34,168
It was basically, there's
a difference between

60
00:02:34,168 --> 00:02:35,001
human beings.

61
00:02:35,001 --> 00:02:37,571
Failure to respect those
differences, in the name

62
00:02:37,571 --> 00:02:39,314
of equality is what leads to gulags.

63
00:02:39,314 --> 00:02:42,058
So, while Jordan is, Jordan--

64
00:02:42,058 --> 00:02:44,727
I think he's a little less

65
00:02:44,727 --> 00:02:48,352
robust in the language he
uses with regard to the left,

66
00:02:48,352 --> 00:02:51,208
he's just as anti-left
with regard to the focus on

67
00:02:51,208 --> 00:02:52,954
hard-core egalitarianism.

68
00:02:52,954 --> 00:02:56,495
Where the left, I do think
and I do make a distinction

69
00:02:56,495 --> 00:02:59,011
between as I have said
between liberals and leftists.

70
00:02:59,011 --> 00:03:02,516
The left is a far more censorious force.

71
00:03:02,516 --> 00:03:04,399
They want to censor a lot more,

72
00:03:04,399 --> 00:03:05,793
they're a lot more tramanical.

73
00:03:05,793 --> 00:03:07,768
They want to control a
lot more from the top.

74
00:03:07,768 --> 00:03:08,883
People who are liberals,
who are arguing over the

75
00:03:08,883 --> 00:03:11,251
proper scope of government,
in particular areas--

76
00:03:11,251 --> 00:03:12,372
there I think, there is plenty to learn

77
00:03:12,372 --> 00:03:14,316
and I think you can have
fulsome exchanges about

78
00:03:14,316 --> 00:03:17,918
the nature of what sort
of social welfare state

79
00:03:17,918 --> 00:03:20,433
can be supported or is appropriate

80
00:03:20,433 --> 00:03:21,596
and you can have a data exchange

81
00:03:21,596 --> 00:03:22,609
on that sort of thing.

82
00:03:22,609 --> 00:03:24,695
Where you can't really have an exchange,

83
00:03:24,695 --> 00:03:26,404
is when you're running up against--

84
00:03:26,404 --> 00:03:29,113
is when people are falsifying
the facts as they are

85
00:03:29,113 --> 00:03:30,741
when they say that men and
women are exactly the same,

86
00:03:30,741 --> 00:03:31,574
for example.

87
00:03:31,574 --> 00:03:33,135
So, I appreciate the critique,

88
00:03:33,135 --> 00:03:35,303
and I'll try to take that to heart.

89
00:03:35,303 --> 00:03:37,345
And I think that, I will
acknowledge also that I think

90
00:03:37,345 --> 00:03:39,456
that folks had a lot more
to learn from the left

91
00:03:39,456 --> 00:03:41,338
in the 1960s than they do now.

92
00:03:41,338 --> 00:03:43,830
Because the country has moved
in a lot of very good ways

93
00:03:43,830 --> 00:03:47,589
since the 1960s and in some
bad ways since the 1960s.

94
00:03:47,589 --> 00:03:48,806
- Fair enough, thank you.

95
00:03:48,806 --> 00:03:50,263
- Thanks a lot.

96
00:03:50,263 --> 00:03:51,848
(applause)

97
00:03:51,848 --> 00:03:52,734
- Can I ask another question?

98
00:03:52,734 --> 00:03:54,295
- Yeah, one more. Go for it.

99
00:03:54,295 --> 00:03:55,384
- Will you have another one?

100
00:03:55,384 --> 00:03:56,217
- Mm-hmm.

101
00:03:56,217 --> 00:03:59,698
- Okay, and this one, this
has to do with the whole

102
00:03:59,698 --> 00:04:01,872
national anthem and players kneeling

103
00:04:01,872 --> 00:04:03,740
during the games in the NFL.

104
00:04:03,740 --> 00:04:05,240
So, my question is this:

105
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:07,763
I feel that regardless of
whether you agree with the act

106
00:04:07,763 --> 00:04:10,220
or not, someone taking a knee
during the national anthem,

107
00:04:10,220 --> 00:04:11,845
at the beginning of a football game.

108
00:04:11,845 --> 00:04:15,455
I believe that if you, if you
don't say, "okay, I disagree

109
00:04:15,455 --> 00:04:17,173
with the act. I don't
think it's the right place,

110
00:04:17,173 --> 00:04:18,863
I don't think it's the right

111
00:04:18,863 --> 00:04:22,613
whatever the case may be,
however I agree with it

112
00:04:22,613 --> 00:04:25,906
in so much as I would like
to protect that individual's

113
00:04:25,906 --> 00:04:27,449
freedom of speech".

114
00:04:27,449 --> 00:04:29,949
And my question is: I
don't hear, you certainly

115
00:04:29,949 --> 00:04:32,447
or a lot of anyone on
the conservative side

116
00:04:32,447 --> 00:04:36,416
or right side as you would call
it, as someone may call it.

117
00:04:36,416 --> 00:04:39,526
Defending, saying, "look I
don't agree with it but I

118
00:04:39,526 --> 00:04:41,843
agree with that person's
freedom of speech in that moment

119
00:04:41,843 --> 00:04:43,436
of utilizing that act."

120
00:04:43,436 --> 00:04:44,269
- So, it depends on the forum.

121
00:04:44,269 --> 00:04:45,102
So, this is a public university;

122
00:04:45,102 --> 00:04:47,418
I have a right to speak here, right?

123
00:04:47,418 --> 00:04:48,427
There is a difference between that and,

124
00:04:48,427 --> 00:04:49,968
for example, DePaul University.

125
00:04:49,968 --> 00:04:52,173
So, DePaul University
is a private university.

126
00:04:52,173 --> 00:04:54,389
Last year, I think it was last year,

127
00:04:54,389 --> 00:04:55,222
DePaul invited me to speak or at least

128
00:04:55,222 --> 00:04:56,592
some of the students did.

129
00:04:56,592 --> 00:04:58,042
The administration said I couldn't

130
00:04:58,042 --> 00:04:59,496
and when I showed up on campus,

131
00:04:59,496 --> 00:05:01,112
they threatened to arrest me.

132
00:05:01,112 --> 00:05:03,460
I didn't sue the university
because they have a right

133
00:05:03,460 --> 00:05:04,382
to do that.

134
00:05:04,382 --> 00:05:05,968
I think they're wrong,
I think they're foolish,

135
00:05:05,968 --> 00:05:07,138
but they have a right to do that.

136
00:05:07,138 --> 00:05:09,046
And so, Colin Kapernick
does not have the right

137
00:05:09,046 --> 00:05:12,342
to kneel on the sidelines
of a private NFL event.

138
00:05:12,342 --> 00:05:14,367
If he wants to kneel in a park,

139
00:05:14,367 --> 00:05:15,434
he's more than welcome to do so.

140
00:05:15,434 --> 00:05:16,416
- According to who, he
doesn't have the right?

141
00:05:16,416 --> 00:05:17,944
- Well, he doesn't have the legal right.

142
00:05:17,944 --> 00:05:19,900
He can't sue the NFL to force them.

143
00:05:19,900 --> 00:05:21,872
- Oh, so he can't sue the
NFL. Certainly, I agree.

144
00:05:21,872 --> 00:05:23,331
- So, that's the
distinction that I'm making.

145
00:05:23,331 --> 00:05:25,403
When it comes to, if Colin
Kapernick were to come here

146
00:05:25,403 --> 00:05:27,622
and, like right here, you
know, and after the event

147
00:05:27,622 --> 00:05:29,231
that we haven't organized,
he wants to kneel

148
00:05:29,231 --> 00:05:30,371
on the stage all day
long, that's totally fine.

149
00:05:30,371 --> 00:05:32,297
It's a public university,
he can do what he wants.

150
00:05:32,297 --> 00:05:35,883
So time, place, and manner
restrictions are a thing

151
00:05:35,883 --> 00:05:37,730
and so is private versus public.

152
00:05:37,730 --> 00:05:40,130
So, I'll defend Colin
Kapernick's right to say

153
00:05:40,130 --> 00:05:42,155
whatever the hell he
wants in any public area

154
00:05:42,155 --> 00:05:44,114
so long as he's not violating
the rights of private

155
00:05:44,114 --> 00:05:45,965
property owners to control
their property because

156
00:05:45,965 --> 00:05:46,882
they do have rights.

157
00:05:46,882 --> 00:05:48,534
He couldn't come into my living room

158
00:05:48,534 --> 00:05:49,935
and just kneel on the floor.

159
00:05:49,935 --> 00:05:52,671
- Do you think the conversation
is based around the

160
00:05:52,671 --> 00:05:54,958
fact that the NFL is a
private organization or

161
00:05:54,958 --> 00:05:57,279
is it based around the
fact that they feel that

162
00:05:57,279 --> 00:05:59,624
action disrespects our
military in that moment

163
00:05:59,624 --> 00:06:01,991
because the national anthem
is so associated with--

164
00:06:01,991 --> 00:06:03,311
- Well, I think the NFL handled this

165
00:06:03,311 --> 00:06:04,383
in the worst way possible;

166
00:06:04,383 --> 00:06:05,736
which is that they allow certain messages

167
00:06:05,736 --> 00:06:06,672
and not other messages.

168
00:06:06,672 --> 00:06:07,544
- Then we're on the same page.

169
00:06:07,544 --> 00:06:08,989
- Right. So like, a few years ago,

170
00:06:08,989 --> 00:06:10,539
there were a bunch of
guys in Missouri that

171
00:06:10,539 --> 00:06:11,605
did the "Hands Up, Don't
Shoot" symbol coming at the

172
00:06:11,605 --> 00:06:13,507
St. Louis Rams. They
came out of the tunnel

173
00:06:13,507 --> 00:06:14,719
doing the "Hands Up, Don't Shoot".

174
00:06:14,719 --> 00:06:16,339
They weren't fined, nothing happened.

175
00:06:16,339 --> 00:06:18,300
If the NFL wants to set a
standard that you're not allowed

176
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:20,159
to make political
statements during the games

177
00:06:20,159 --> 00:06:22,368
or in the warm ups or
something, totally cool.

178
00:06:22,368 --> 00:06:24,410
But if they're going to be
inconsistent in the application

179
00:06:24,410 --> 00:06:26,182
of those standards, then I've got a bit

180
00:06:26,182 --> 00:06:27,746
of a problem with them.

181
00:06:27,746 --> 00:06:29,837
And I think that Roger Goodell has done

182
00:06:29,837 --> 00:06:31,027
a terrible job with that.

183
00:06:31,027 --> 00:06:32,751
You know how you know this?

184
00:06:32,751 --> 00:06:34,567
Because David Stern
actually banned people from

185
00:06:34,567 --> 00:06:36,772
sitting for the national
anthem in 1996 with

186
00:06:36,772 --> 00:06:38,529
Mahmoud Abdul-Rauf and nothing happened.

187
00:06:38,529 --> 00:06:40,692
He set the standard,
that was the end of it.

188
00:06:40,692 --> 00:06:42,364
If you want to protest,
don't protest here.

189
00:06:42,364 --> 00:06:44,998
Go protest somewhere
else and nobody cared.

190
00:06:44,998 --> 00:06:46,149
That's really not even the larger,

191
00:06:46,149 --> 00:06:48,749
look the larger issue about
Kapernick is, you know

192
00:06:48,749 --> 00:06:50,758
whether it is appropriate
generally for people to

193
00:06:50,758 --> 00:06:52,029
kneel for the national anthem or whether

194
00:06:52,029 --> 00:06:53,709
we should be insulted by that.

195
00:06:53,709 --> 00:06:56,434
You know, my feeling is that
it's generally not appropriate

196
00:06:56,434 --> 00:06:58,870
but having the right to do
something does not make it

197
00:06:58,870 --> 00:07:01,197
the appropriate or right thing to do.

198
00:07:01,197 --> 00:07:03,255
I don't think that kneeling
for the national anthem

199
00:07:03,255 --> 00:07:04,988
is either smart politics
or the right things to do

200
00:07:04,988 --> 00:07:07,003
because there are certain
things that still have to

201
00:07:07,003 --> 00:07:08,578
unify us; like the idea that the country

202
00:07:08,578 --> 00:07:11,795
is based on good foundations
and if he wanted to kneel

203
00:07:11,795 --> 00:07:13,536
for the national anthem
outside a police station

204
00:07:13,536 --> 00:07:16,237
I think that would be a
lot more useful for his

205
00:07:16,237 --> 00:07:18,825
supposed cause than, you know

206
00:07:18,825 --> 00:07:20,905
taking millions and millions
of dollars in contracts

207
00:07:20,905 --> 00:07:24,219
from Nike to pretend to be
a social justice warrior.

208
00:07:24,219 --> 00:07:26,064
I'm very skeptical of Colin Kapernick.

209
00:07:26,064 --> 00:07:27,418
I think there are a lot
of people who actually

210
00:07:27,418 --> 00:07:29,204
care about these issues
and have studied the issues

211
00:07:29,204 --> 00:07:32,238
and don't wear socks with
pictures of cops as pigs on them.

212
00:07:32,238 --> 00:07:35,023
- Yeah, I just want to say thank you

213
00:07:35,023 --> 00:07:38,712
and I agree that if that
was going to happen,

214
00:07:38,712 --> 00:07:41,372
Colin Kapernick may not have
been the best proponent,

215
00:07:41,372 --> 00:07:44,538
the best individual to make
that stand in that situation.

216
00:07:44,538 --> 00:07:45,371
Thank you so much.

217
00:07:45,371 --> 00:00:00,000
- I appreciate it. Thank
you so much for coming.
