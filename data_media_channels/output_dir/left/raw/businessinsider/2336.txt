00:00:12,170 --> 00:00:15,839
here we are<font color="#E5E5E5"> talking about the Obama tax</font>

2
00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:18,660
plan so let's get right into it what is

3
00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:21,330
the plan<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's a new tax that will be</font>

4
00:00:21,330 --> 00:00:23,850
levied<font color="#E5E5E5"> on financial institutions the</font>

5
00:00:23,850 --> 00:00:28,650
banks will pay 0.15 percent of attacks

6
00:00:28,650 --> 00:00:31,710
on all of their assets with deductions

7
00:00:31,710 --> 00:00:36,059
for cash and other<font color="#CCCCCC"> high-quality</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> assets</font>

8
00:00:36,059 --> 00:00:38,850
such as common stock retained earnings

9
00:00:38,850 --> 00:00:42,300
and their deposits who gets hit with the

10
00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:44,760
tax any financial institution that

11
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:46,800
received tarp money or government

12
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:48,870
guarantees of their debt and has at

13
00:00:48,870 --> 00:00:51,840
least 50 billion dollars in total assets

14
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:54,090
gets taxed that includes banks and

15
00:00:54,090 --> 00:00:56,520
brokerages Morgan Stanley<font color="#CCCCCC"> JPMorgan</font>

16
00:00:56,520 --> 00:00:59,160
Goldman Sachs but also insurance

17
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:01,890
companies and<font color="#E5E5E5"> General Electric why are</font>

18
00:01:01,890 --> 00:01:04,739
we taxing these guys specifically it's

19
00:01:04,739 --> 00:01:07,049
the Willie Sutton theory that is when

20
00:01:07,049 --> 00:01:09,570
Willie Sutton was asked why do you rob

21
00:01:09,570 --> 00:01:12,270
banks Willie he replied<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's where the</font>

22
00:01:12,270 --> 00:01:15,979
money is who gets off the hook<font color="#CCCCCC"> here well</font>

23
00:01:15,979 --> 00:01:18,689
Fannie and Freddie don't get taxed even

24
00:01:18,689 --> 00:01:20,130
though they were right at the middle of

25
00:01:20,130 --> 00:01:22,259
the financial crisis and neither do

26
00:01:22,259 --> 00:01:24,240
General Motors and Chrysler even though

27
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:26,700
they received a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of tarp money why</font>

28
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:29,549
are<font color="#E5E5E5"> they excused it's the reverse Willie</font>

29
00:01:29,549 --> 00:01:32,009
Sutton theory they just<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have the</font>

30
00:01:32,009 --> 00:01:35,640
money so<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's what the tax is and who</font>

31
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:38,490
it applies to now let's<font color="#E5E5E5"> get into whether</font>

32
00:01:38,490 --> 00:01:40,259
or not it's a good idea what do<font color="#E5E5E5"> we think</font>

33
00:01:40,259 --> 00:01:42,299
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the new tax is it just another</font>

34
00:01:42,299 --> 00:01:45,540
scam being pulled<font color="#E5E5E5"> off by the government</font>

35
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:47,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">and the bankers on the taxpayers</font>

36
00:01:47,780 --> 00:01:51,149
surprisingly it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> all bad there's</font>

37
00:01:51,149 --> 00:01:52,649
some good aspects of it so we'll go

38
00:01:52,649 --> 00:01:55,470
through the good the bad and the really

39
00:01:55,470 --> 00:01:59,850
ugly start with the good the tax<font color="#E5E5E5"> is an</font>

40
00:01:59,850 --> 00:02:02,460
attempt to tax risk at the banks it

41
00:02:02,460 --> 00:02:06,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">rewards banks that have more capital</font>

42
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,489
punishes banks that engage in risky

43
00:02:08,489 --> 00:02:10,919
activity and are thinly capitalized

44
00:02:10,919 --> 00:02:13,000
that's a good<font color="#E5E5E5"> idea</font>

45
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,940
and really brings us beyond the wreckage

46
00:02:15,940 --> 00:02:18,580
of capital reserve requirements and

47
00:02:18,580 --> 00:02:20,650
other bank supervision regulations that

48
00:02:20,650 --> 00:02:23,050
just proved to be completely ineffective

49
00:02:23,050 --> 00:02:26,050
during the crisis so we have to applaud

50
00:02:26,050 --> 00:02:29,740
them for<font color="#E5E5E5"> that it also doesn't rely on</font>

51
00:02:29,740 --> 00:02:32,620
the ratings<font color="#CCCCCC"> agencies this is great</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we've</font>

52
00:02:32,620 --> 00:02:34,840
had way too much reliance on the rating

53
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:36,880
agencies which just have shown that

54
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:39,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">they're incompetent when it comes to</font>

55
00:02:39,010 --> 00:02:41,080
really talking about risk we need to

56
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:43,000
tear them out root and<font color="#CCCCCC"> branch from our</font>

57
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,150
from our regulations and<font color="#E5E5E5"> for once we're</font>

58
00:02:46,150 --> 00:02:47,350
finally<font color="#E5E5E5"> getting a regulation that</font>

59
00:02:47,350 --> 00:02:49,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">doesn't talk about high quality or</font>

60
00:02:49,570 --> 00:02:51,790
highly rated assets instead<font color="#E5E5E5"> it is</font>

61

deposits common stock retained earnings

62
00:02:55,090 --> 00:02:58,180
the other great thing is that<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not a</font>

63
00:02:58,180 --> 00:03:01,000
tax on bank profits the problem with<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">tax on bank profits is the bankers will</font>

00:03:03,370 --> 00:03:05,100
just pay themselves more in bonuses

66
00:03:05,100 --> 00:03:07,840
reducing their profits allowing them to

67
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:10,989
loot their own institutions and rely on

68
00:03:10,989 --> 00:03:12,970
taxpayers to bail them out at<font color="#CCCCCC"> the end</font>

69
00:03:12,970 --> 00:03:17,290
which<font color="#E5E5E5"> brings us</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to the bad the main</font>

70
00:03:17,290 --> 00:03:19,420
problem the biggest<font color="#CCCCCC"> problem with this</font>

71
00:03:19,420 --> 00:03:22,180
plan is that it doesn't do<font color="#E5E5E5"> anything</font>

72
00:03:22,180 --> 00:03:25,269
<font color="#E5E5E5">about too big to fail indeed it might</font>

73
00:03:25,269 --> 00:03:27,250
make that problem worse in a perverse

74
00:03:27,250 --> 00:03:29,230
way we've already designated certain

75
00:03:29,230 --> 00:03:31,570
banks as tier 1 financial institutions

76
00:03:31,570 --> 00:03:34,630
and that's read as basically giving them

77
00:03:34,630 --> 00:03:36,880
an implicit guarantee from the taxpayers

78
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:39,459
that if they fail we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to step in</font>

79
00:03:39,459 --> 00:03:41,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">this tax might also be viewed like that</font>

80
00:03:41,590 --> 00:03:44,560
you pay the tax you may be buying

81
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:46,750
yourself the right to a future bailout

82
00:03:46,750 --> 00:03:48,820
this isn't just an abstract deal the

83
00:03:48,820 --> 00:03:51,610
danger<font color="#CCCCCC"> here constantly throughout the</font>

84
00:03:51,610 --> 00:03:54,220
crisis we were told that a bank bailout

85
00:03:54,220 --> 00:03:55,959
would make a decent<font color="#E5E5E5"> return for taxpayers</font>

86
00:03:55,959 --> 00:03:58,600
this tax institutionalizes that<font color="#E5E5E5"> promised</font>

future<font color="#E5E5E5"> bailouts can be justified on the</font>

88
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:03,070
grounds that will have this nifty tax to

89
00:04:03,070 --> 00:04:04,930
make sure the taxpayers get paid back

90
00:04:04,930 --> 00:04:07,870
too big to fail once again<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's a</font>

means that small brokerages will never

103

the Obama administration<font color="#E5E5E5"> is pushing this</font>

104
00:04:39,070 --> 00:04:42,820
with a populist rhetoric of punishing

107
00:04:48,010 --> 00:04:49,720
that's a little bit like throwing a

steak<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the floor and beating the dog</font>

109

after it eats it I don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually think</font>
