>> Martha: PRESIDENT TRUMP ONE
OF THE ELECTION TARGETING WHAT
HE CALLED THE FORGOTTEN MEN AND
WOMEN OF AMERICA.
BUT FOR THE PAST THREE YEARS
PULITZER PRIZE WINNER CHARLIE LE
DUFF HAS BEEN TRAVELING DIGGING
INTO WHO THEY ARE AND WERE AND
WHO FORGOT ABOUT THEM.
HE ONCE HIT A GOLF BALL FROM ONE
END OF TO THE OTHER OF HIS HOME
CITY OF DETROIT TO SHOW HOW
BLEAK AND CAST ASIDE IT REALLY
WAS.
>> UNCOMMITTED BECAUSE THEY ARE
TALKING ABOUT REINVENTING THE
CITY.
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN WITH DOZENS
OF BUDGET CUTS?
WHAT DOES THE CITY LOOK LIKE
BLOCK BY BLOCK?
WHO LIVES HERE?
>> Martha: HE CHRONICLED THE
ABSURDITY OF THE SOUTHERN BORDER
SITUATION.
>> MEET PUBLIC ENEMY NUMBER ONE.
A GUATEMALAN BOY NAMED DOMINGO.
HE AND HIS MOTHER WERE ARRESTED
BY BORDER PATROL A FEW DAYS
EARLIER.
THEY WERE PROCESSED, GIVEN A
NOTICE TO APPEAR IN IMMIGRATION
COURT AND THEN GIVEN A BUS
TICKET TO LOS ANGELES PAID FOR
BY YOU WILL COME, THE TAXPAYER.
>> Martha: HE WROTE ABOUT IT
IN HIS BRAND-NEW BOOK, "S SHOW"
I GUESS IS WHAT WE WILL CALL IT.
GREAT TO SEE YOU.
IT'S A FASCINATING JOURNEY THAT
YOU HAVE BEEN ON.
CHRONICLE CORRUPTION ALL OVER
THE PLACE AND YOU SAY GRAFT GOES
ON ALL OVER THE PLACE.
REMEMBER THE NEW ORLEANS
MAYOR WENT TO PRISON FOR PATTING
HIS MONEY WITH HURRICANE KATRINA
MONEY.
YOU HAVE VISITED PLACES WHERE SO
MANY OF THESE OFFICIALS END UP
IN JAIL.
>> THE WAY I SEE IT, ALL OF
AMERICA IS ANGRY.
ONE OVERRIDING THING THAT THEY
ARE ANGRY ABOUT IS THE
GOVERNMENT.
PICK YOUR LEVEL.
THE POLICE, THE MAYOR, THE
COUNTY, THE PRESIDENT.
THE PEOPLE THAT VOTED FOR TRUMP
ARE NOT THE ONLY FORGOTTEN ONCE.
IF YOU ADD TRUMP PLUS BERNIE,
THAT'S ABOUT 70 OR 75%.
AND IF THEY WERE WOMEN, IT'S
PROBABLY 80 OR 85%.
THINGS AREN'T GOING WELL NO
MATTER WHAT PEOPLE ARE SAYING,
WE ARE NOT SAVING, THE WAGES ARE
NOT GOING OUT.
THE NEW JOBS THAT ARE BEING
CREATED, THEY ARE MAKING NEW
BEDS AND WIPING PEOPLE'S
BOTTOMS, YOU KNOW WHAT I'M
SAYING, BUT YOU CAN'T PUT A KID
THROUGH COLLEGE WITH THAT.
THE ONE YOU WENT INTO FERGUSON,
TALKED ABOUT THIS YOUNG MAN WHO
SAVED THAT GUY'S SHOP.
THEN YOU WENT LOOKING FOR THIS
YOUNG MAN NAMED DJ.
IN THE MAN SAID, I COULDN'T GIVE
HIM A JOB.
IT STRIKES ME THAT THERE WAS
THAT LACK OF INTEGRITY AND
RESPECT FOR EACH OTHER.
THOSE KINDS OF THINGS DON'T
HAPPEN AS MANY TIMES AS THEY
SHOULD, WHERE HE WOULD SAY TO
HIMSELF, I NEED TO DO RIGHT BY
THE CICADA, HE REALLY HELPED ME
OUT.
THOSE MOMENTS SEEM TO DISAPPEAR.
HOW DO WE GET THEM BACK?
NOT TO SAY THERE AREN'T GOOD
PEOPLE IN THE WORLD.
>> WHILE PART OF IT IS THE
MEDIA.
WHAT WE CAN DO, THAT GUY'S NAME
IS DJ.
AND I TRIED TO FIND HIM.
IF YOU ARE WATCHING, CALL ME.
I RESPECT YOU.
THIS IS A 25-YEAR-OLD GUY, DARK,
HANDSOME, DREADLOCKED.
INSTEAD OF USING THE TELEPHOTO
LENS, WE WENT IN THERE, THERE
WERE PEOPLE TRYING TO LOOT THE
STORE AND LIGHT IT ON FIRE AND
HE TRIED TO STOP THEM.
HE SAID, THIS IS NOT RIGHT, THIS
IS NOT WHAT WE DO.
HE DIDN'T PLUG THEM, BUT HE
TRIED.
POLICE HAVE ABANDONED THE THING
AND HE WENT IN THERE AND TRIED.
I THINK THAT IS WHO WE ARE.
ONCE HE LEFT THAN THE CROWD
THROUGH BATTERIES AT US AND HIT
US WITH TRAFFIC CONES, AND ME
AND MY PARTNERS MATT PHILLIPS
AND BOB SHUTTLE BAUER, THEY ARE
PART OF THIS BOOK.
WE WANTED TO SHOW DJ.
THE MORE WE CAN SHOW DJ, AND IN
THOSE HARD TIMES IN AMERICAN
OURSELVES AND RESPECT HIM.
THAT SHOP OWNER THAT DID NOT
GIVE HIM THE JOB AFTER THE FIRST
BURNING, THEY BURNED IT TO THE
GROUND.
>> Martha: WHAT I FIND TALKING
TO PEOPLE IS, THE ONES WHO SEEM
TO HAVE IT, THEY DON'T REALLY
STAY THAT LONG.
THEY GO TO WASHINGTON FOR A FEW
YEARS AND THEN THEY SAY, YOU
KNOW, I'M NOT GOING TO BE ABLE
TO CHANGE THE STATE.
IT'S WAY TOO BIG, TOO OUT OF
CONTROL.
IT MAKES YOU WONDER, IS AT THE
FALL OF ROME?
DO WE EVER FIX IT OR IS THIS
HISTORY 100 YEARS FROM NOW THAT
SAYS, THAT'S WHAT IT LOOKED LIKE
AS WE ARE GOING DOWN?
>> NOT TO BE TOO BIBLICAL BUT
EVERYTHING THE WORLD BUILDS,
FALLS.
DEMOCRACY IS A BEAUTIFUL THING,
VERY PATIENT THING.
YOU JUST KEEP TRYING.
I DON'T LIKE TO TELL PEOPLE,
RELAX, IT'S GOING TO GET BETTER.
LIFE COMES AND GOES, YOU OWE GOD
THAT LIFE BACK, RIGHT?
I DON'T EXPECT PEOPLE TO BE
PATIENT.
BUT FOR GOD SAKE, DON'T BRING
THINGS DOWN.
DON'T STEAL THINGS, DON'T POINT
GUNS AT POLICE.
YOU KNOW, YOU ARE A FORMER
SOLDIER, HE PROBABLY WAS TWO.
YOU DON'T CALL THE CONGRESS,
THEY ARE CALLING BACK.
BUT, THE KING SHIPS DIDN'T WORK,
TRIBALISM CAN'T WORK AND
SOMETHING THIS LARGE, COMMUNISM
DIDN'T WORK.
AND, THAT'S THE WORST FORM OF
GOVERNMENT THERE, EXCEPT ALL THE
OTHERS.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH, GOOD LUCK
WITH THE BOOK.
IT'S FASCINATING.
