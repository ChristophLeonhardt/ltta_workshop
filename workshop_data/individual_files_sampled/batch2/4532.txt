thing one tonight if there's one thing we know about Mitt Romney it's that he loves to talk sport I met a guy yesterday seven feet tall yeah handsome great big guy seven feet tall name is Rick Miller Portland Oregon and he started a business of course you know I was in basketball but it wasn't in basketball I mean I figured he had to be in sport but he wasn't in sport and that wasn't one off if you search Romney's 2004 book turn around you'll find more than 30 results for the word sport singular most of them in phrases word indeed normally right Sports Romney also likes to engage in sport like the time he fought have you ate champ van der holle field in a charity boxing match looking to be good there he likes to oversee sport as he did at the 2002 Salt Lake Winter Olympics and he certainly definitely likes to watch sport there he is cheering on the Utah Jazz last night in his personalized jersey worn over a button-down shirt a hometown fan if ever there was one rooting for the team that he loves no no not that one that's thing two in 60 seconds Mitt Romney a Michigan native the former governor of Massachusetts who currently owns houses in three other states is making it very clear that Utah is his real home I have decided to run for the United States Senate because I believe I can help bring Utah's values and Utah's lessons to Washington Utah is a better model for Washington than Washington is for Utah Utah the state is called Utah that's where he's running from it's Utah now Romney has been working overtime to brand himself as mr. Utah he changed his Twitter home location from Massachusetts to Holliday Utah he invited an AP photographer to snap these epic shots of himself just hanging out chilling oh oh are you there looking at me I just happened to be here in arches national park last month and just last night he traded in his Boston Celtics fan gear for a Utah Jazz Jersey when Oklahoma City point card Russell Westbrook got in foul trouble four fouls well mr.
