00:00:00,099 --> 00:00:03,879
When you call the nation of Sweden, you learn
a few key things.

2
00:00:06,380 --> 00:00:08,380
"Hi, is this Sweden?"

3
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:12,360
If you know nothing about soccer, you'd learn
about Zlatan.

4
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:16,280
"Who would you say is the most famous person
in Sweden?"

5
00:00:20,300 --> 00:00:22,800
You  learn how they cope with low light in
winter.

6
00:00:22,810 --> 00:00:26,690
"One thing I wanted to ask you was about the
darkness.

7
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:32,820
And you learn about ... foraging.

8
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:35,860
This isn't dumpster diving, it's a national

9
00:00:35,870 --> 00:00:40,870
institution that a lot of people do.
In the fall months it's mushrooms, in the

10
00:00:40,870 --> 00:00:45,960
spring, all different kinds of berries.
The search for food is a pan-Scandinavian

11
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:51,839
tradition, but it's so Swedish that the government
issues pamphlets about how to forage well.

12
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:55,500
And that foraging is part of a Swedish right
called...

13
00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:17,720
In 1994, Sweden added it to the constitution.
It's the right to temporarily stay on public

14
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:22,640
and some private land, walk on it, and, yeah,
forage too.

15
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:26,979
The line between public and private property
is a blurrier one than in America.

16
00:01:26,979 --> 00:01:30,909
It can seem a little weird to Americans.
"So if you have private property, there's

17
00:01:30,909 --> 00:01:32,400
no way to protect your berries?"

18
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
"Alright, talk to you later."

19
00:02:02,480 --> 00:00:00,000
"Ah, yeah, no I'm definitely familiar with
them. That makes sense."
