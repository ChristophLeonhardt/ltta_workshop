safe legal and rare isn't that the mantra of pro-choice activists well it sounds like it's more like safe legal and everywhere now at least according to the NDP Alberta's Health Minister Sarah Hoffman says the NDP is going to expand abortion access outside of Alberta's two major city centers of Edmonton and Calgary and this is just the latest in the NDP's obsession with abortion over the last 12 months last summer the Health Minister Sarah Hoffman insisted that all Alberta women should have access to an abortion pill regardless of whether or not that woman has provincial health insurance Hoffman said any women living in Alberta I don't care where you live I don't actually care whether you're yet a citizen they have the right to access this and then last month Alberta introduced a bill mandating safe zones around abortion clinics claiming patients and workers are increasingly being intimidated outside of clinics while simultaneously producing no evidence beyond anecdotes that this is even really happening what most people fail to mention is that both clinics in Edmonton and Calgary already have court orders keeping protesters at a safe distance so why would the NDP bring forward legislation when a court has already dealt with this well I'll answer that for you at the end of this story the Alberta NDP seem really really increasingly focused on this pro-abortion quote unquote women's health narrative despite being in the midst of a constitutional battle with British Columbia over a pipeline and an economic recovery that doesn't seem to be happening for very many Albertans and strangely or maybe not all that strangely at all the mainstream media in Alberta seems very willing to help the NDP make abortion access seem like an issue it really isn't to most people let me show you just a few recent examples of the fake news around the new bubbles own legislation that I mentioned earlier here's a CBC article about these so-called safe bubble zones that will protect patients from harassment outside of abortion clinics the first line in the story they're quotes a clinic worker as saying it's really escalated with the number of people their aggressiveness and their lack of respect gosh if it's really escalating around these clinics I do want to know about it I'm for peaceful protests and free expression and free speech but I'm certainly not for breaking court-ordered injunction zones and obvious harassment so I went to the government's very own video that they produced to demonstrate the need for this bubble zone legislation let's see what these increasingly violent and harassing protesters really look like here there are two really big protests throughout the year called the 40 Days for Life protest and it's currently going on right now so we have seen a pretty big increase of protesters so sometimes when it come to work I'll come pretty early so if it's in the winter months it'll be pitch black outside and as I'm driving up I will see sometimes one two maybe three or four protesters across the street with or without signs I mean it doesn't matter it's intimidating and especially for the patients as well I really feel for them okay so it's like 2:00 to 4:00 grandma's standing across the street in silence holding a sign that's the harassment and if you listen to the clinic worker she said that's the peak of the protests someone holding different views across the street is intimidating to these people the government couldn't even find aggressive protestors to put in their own video about the need for legislation to deal with aggressive protesters and you know what else neither could the CBC because this article here that the CBC wrote about the need for legislation well it doesn't use a picture of a protest outside of an Alberta abortion clinic nor does it use pictures of Alberta anti-abortion protest nor does it use a picture from the last decade that picture there is from outside of a Morgentaler Montreal clinic from 2008 but you wouldn't know that because it's not marked under the picture CBC couldn't find aggressive protestors and the government would have you believe they're outside these clinics all the time the Edmonton Journal used this March for life photo in lieu of them finding actual protestors because they wanted to make it seem like these sorts of large crowds are in front of the clinics by the way this is such slander against the March for life because the March for Life they don't even allow graphic imagery in their March and they forbid responding to hateful comments directed at them as they march in Edmonton and this photo here again in the Journal these people look angry and it looks like there's a heck of a lot of them but if you look at the date on the photo it's not from 2018 and it's not from in front of an abortion clinic either it's from a protest at the legislature in 2013 this is the epitome of fake news if the mainstream media has to use these stock photos in their stories about the protesters in front of abortion clinics then the folks praying peacefully across the street from a clinic are not the issue they are being portrayed as I've got yet another egregious example of the fake news surrounding the NDP's abortion narrative the NDP would love to have you believe that Jason Kenney would return the province to the days of the back alleys and coat hangers the CBC wrote an article on two motions that didn't even make the list of things to vote on at the United Conservative Party's inaugural policy convention this coming weekend the article read both the Wilberforce project and parents for choice in education a group that's fought GSA's in Alberta schools have encouraged their members to take part in these surveys they have asked members to vote in favor of policies like parental notification when a child joins a Gay Straight Alliance support for the traditional definitions of gender and marriage okay that might be scary if you're a socialist crazy person but it doesn't particularly scare me and most conservatives who just sort of want to be left alone but here's the crux of the article and it is literally about nothing those last two items did not make it on the list the UCP source says the article then goes on to say however the draft policies could raise new worries for pro-choice advocates women's groups and the LGBT community about what effect UCP leader Jason Kenney will have if he is elected the premier while he is personally opposed to abortion Kenny said he would not change the status quo so CBC wrote a whole article about how social conservative policies that didn't even make the list of UCP policies to vote on are now worrying people what was the point of any of this except to carry water for the NDP and fear monger about Jason Kenney and there's an underlying anti-catholic bigotry in all of this by the way but there's a real reason for all of this there's a reason for this frantic pro-choice fear-mongering out of well literally nowhere a new poll commissioned by the CBC and conducted by Janet Brown opinion research shows that on anything remotely economy-related the UCP was picked as the best party by a large majority of Albertans even the issues where in Canada you would normally expect to see a left-wing party being considered the best manager of like health care and education the UCP still won the day the poll also determined Alberta's top of mind issues they included pipelines the economy jobs deficit government healthcare diversification environment taxes and education but you know what issue wasn't on the list of things that people cared about as a top of mind issue access to abortion look I'm pro-life I fully recognize that this is a very important issue for a certain demographic of Albertans including myself but it is nowhere near being on the radar of the general voter the NDP are losing on all the issues people really care about so they're trying to desperately search for an issue they can win on they're failing on pipelines they are failing on the economy and Albertans just don't trust them anymore so the NDP while they're rummaging around in the progressive grab bag for anything they can snatch out and try to scare people with and they are perfectly perfectly okay to pay peaceful protesters and normal pro-lifers as extremists to do it and they have the media to help them but the revolt media I'm Shiela gonna fake news is everywhere but good news so are we we have a brand new rebel media app it's available on the Google Play Store and the Apple App Store download it give it a whirl and fight to fake news wherever you go
