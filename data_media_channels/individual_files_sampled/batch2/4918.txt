as the private business dealings of President Trump's personal attorney come to light the White House is facing questions of access peddling by Michael Cohen who was locked out of a West Wing job and cashed in on his association with Donald Trump The Washington Post reporting that Cohen told an associate in the summer of 2017 I'm crushing it reported payments to Cohen or his company in the first year of the Trump administration nearly three million dollars so far including 1.2 million dollar from drug mayder new drug maker Novartis up to 600,000 AT&T half a million dollars each from Squier patton boggs and Columbus Nova and another 150,000 from Korea aerospace in January of 2017 Cohen announced he would continue to serve as the president's personal attorney in office and said he would resign from the Trump Organization quote to avoid a perceived conflict Cohen's partnership with loving firm Squire Patton Boggs was publicly announced in April 2017 but was separate from his shell company essential consultants at least one company claims that Cohen initiated discussions about offering insight into Trump's White House yesterday the White House would not say what the president thinks about his personal lawyers clients is the president concerned about any aspect of what we've learned in the last 24 hours as you know due to the complications of the different components of this investigation I would refer you the president's outside the special care and outside counsel to address those concerns do you know whether mr. Cohen ever approached the White House as a representative of any companies whether the president was aware of the payments or whether he was aware that mr. Hawley was marketing himself I'm not aware again I would refer you to the outside counsel all right Michael Cohen received millions of dollars apparently peddling the insights that he said he could providing to this administration to America's largest corporations is the present in any way embarrassed or ashamed of that because it seems to be the definition of a swampy behavior I think that would be up to those individuals who make the decision to hire someone just the same way that the companies that you work for make the decision to determine whether or not they think that you're qualified to serve in a position that's the decision of an independent company and has nothing to do with the White House the president promised to dream this one so does he feel it's appropriate that Michael Cohen his personal attorney was selling a system I'm not gonna weigh into this that's a determination that individual companies have to make and I haven't spoken with the president the president taken any action during this administration to Novartis Korea aerospace nothing more last you wonder is she getting the news or answering questions I'm making news I think she's just taken in the news no answers last night Rudy Guiliani told NBC News that President Trump was not involved in Cohen's business dealings before or after the election Joe you know Rudy has been knighted by the Queen of England he was buried no no no no he was he say snide 'add he's been knighted by the Queen of England nothing but but he was knighted by the Queen of England which I think Willie and I I think we were knighted by the Queen of he we can't remember the 1987 was a haze but so Willie a couple of things beyond our knighting we can talk about our own knighting later on and how intelligent you are let's be just say this I just say this about Rudy I mean there's something about him and Trump that the president excuse me maybe they oh they go around talking about how intelligent they are and how smart they are looks like a big space have you ever have you have you ever had like have you ever known people so desperate to go around and talk about how smart I don't know I just I've never met anybody it fired somebody and they told me how intelligent they were I would probably fire him right there on the spot who does that well I carry around a copy of my SAT scores but other I did I oh don't mention it it's implied I think it's it's really it's really strange behavior but anyway and it's it's you've got it you've got like you got it framed is that what you got matrix perforations on the side yeah okay carry it with me that's very exciting yeah very very exciting I almost forgot about what I was going to talk about of course there's nothing well it's improving once again how intelligent rudy giuliani is and the hell just how I'm just a dumb country lawyer you know really I struck some times I wonder how I get through three hours every day you know well it's because you're so smart with your SAT scores available so anyway Michael Cohen him trading access for money that is the swamp but that's what the Obama people a lot of them are doing after you know or people that new barackobama or people that thought they had an end did that with Barack Obama with George W Bush nothing on his face illegal about that but the problem here is of course we have the money with a stormy Daniel slush fund before that may have been up to $400,000 and you also have the problem of this did all this money go to Michael Cohen or was it like his other businesses was it a shell corporation that money passed through that did some get back to Donald Trump did some get back to the Trump Organization and finally what sticks out to me out of all of these corporations he gave money is a tea and tea they have been struggling to get a merger with time water now for quite some time we heard it was dead the president didn't want it now we've heard that everything's okay it's probably going to go through in June most likely I wonder what this massive payment to Michael Cohen does actually to the regulator's who are trying to figure out if that payment may have made a difference in how the Trump administration is treating the AT&T Time Warner merger well we've got some new information on that Joe a source tells CNBC our partners there that AT&T paid Cohen up to $600,000 last year saying that it was for actual work done and not for access including an understanding of the inner workings of Trump in an email to employees the company in early 2017 we hired several consultants to help us understand how the president and his administration might approach a wide range of policy issues important to the company including regulatory reform at the FCC corporate tax reform an antitrust enforcement Cohen was one of those consultants Cohen did no legal or lobbying work for us in our contract with Cohen expired at the end of its term in December 2017 it was not until the following month in January 2018 that the media first reported an AT&T first became aware of the current controversy surrounding Cohen however in a statement late yesterday AT&T acknowledged it was contacted by special counsel Robert Muller's office about Cohen in November of 2017 so Cathy K this story about Michael Cohen and essential consultants LLC is fascinating about Michael Cohen and about the president and selling access but it's also fascinating about a lot of these companies that are now outed and on this list about what exactly they were trying to get out of it and what in many cases they didn't get out of it they thought Michael Cohen would have the ear of the president in many of these cases they dropped the contracts because it turned out he didn't quite have the access they thought they were going to get and to some extent you have to dial back to election day of 2016 right when everybody had assumed that Hillary Clinton was going to win all of these companies presumably had no investments in getting to know people on the Clinton campaign had spoken to her advisers on issues around trade and regulation and then BAM they're hit by the fact that they've backed the wrong horse Donald Trump comes in nobody knows him remember this that nobody knew Donald Trump when he came and he didn't have contacts in Washington he didn't necessarily have contacts in all of these companies and so they're scrambling to get any in they can and along comes Michael Cohen and says I can give you insight I'm super close to the president frankly for AT&T when it's facing this merger deal which is a huge deal for them dropping five hundred thousand is not an incredible amount of money if it was to have paid back for them that would have been a investment that was worth making and the anomaly here is I think the two interesting things is one obviously Donald Trump came in saying he was going to end all of this there was no going to bring no swampy activity under his presidency - we're starting to find out that Bob Miller has known about this for a while how much more does Bob mullah know that we don't know because he's already on to all of this there's another interesting element to this story that gets to Joe's issue of you know IQs their IQs how dumb are these corporations Novartis paid this guy 1.2 million dollars yeah it really plays six hundred what what do their boards think about this right they pay Michael : Oh who's Michael Cohen oh it's trumps lawyer it will what else does he do is you just Trump's lawyer no he owns a bunch of taxicab medallions in New York City he's a real mover and change oh it's it's it's anybody in the world of business knows how Trump does business yeah and you can watch TV to get into the mind of Donald Trump you could watch us you get it for free it isn't that hard what are you paying for what's very it's very painful and and I've got to say one of the reasons these companies may not watch us is that none of us have been knighted by the Queen of England you know not as smart but to a larger point it listen Donald Trump got elected unlike anybody else in modern history if you if you look at everybody that ran before Donald Trump the one thing you can say about him that we said during the campaign that anybody who's being truthful said during the campaign was that his win was historic there had never been anything like it before there will never be anything like it again in the future where one guy with a small ragtag operation gets himself elected president the United States now usually if you do that you have layers upon layers upon layers upon layers of people that work for you when you were in Congress when you were a governor when we're running the Republican National Committee when you're an ambassador when you were whatever Secretary of State so there are literally scores of people that AT&T can purchase and let's just call it what it is that they can buy off to say hey tell us how your boss works and by the way your boss is going to know that we've hired you so it's like peaky blinders you you you've got what side AT&T is on because they picked one of your men or one of your women with Donald Trump it was a very very frightening world to these corporations in January of 2017 because there was no way to work Donald Trump you could talk to Michael Cohen you could talk to Corey Lewandowski you could hire well anybody else who had not been indicted by robert muller and there very few people there you certainly couldn't talk to Manta fort because I think he had two or three ankle bracelets on but there were very few people you could go to to figure out who the inner work how the inner workings of the Trump administration maybe Michael Cohen just happened to be one of them well same as it ever was same as it ever was the only difference here is unlike everybody else that's ever done this Trump had a historic run and he didn't have insiders around him that these companies could buy off yeah there isn't some amazing revelation that is still to come it's more just a drip drip drip of how stupid and how bumbling and how crooked a lot of Donald Trump's business dealings are and shallow and Casey hunt it he is draining the swamp in in a way that we could never imagine and that is on capital oil revealing those who would still stand by a president who has lied thousands of times to the American people about the obvious a president who has been racist at times and a president whose team is being plucked out one by one by the special counsel and potentially flipping on him I mean if you stand by this if you run on this you are part of quite a swamp I think that what you just outlined is part of why there are Republicans who are still essentially clinging to the special counsel and saying look this guy has to finish doing what he's doing because it's really the only way that they're gonna have an opportunity I think in a lot of their views to to make a break I mean you're right they have not yet they have not yet made that break and you know this I think there are a lot of Republicans obviously Democrats on Capitol Hill who look at what Michael Cohen is doing and say you know this is this is amateur hour what you what are these people doing and the key question is you know and and Mike Barnicle touched on this earlier where is this money going what are they doing what is what did Michael Cohen do with the money was there any connection then back to the president back to the Trump Organization and forgive me maybe was Caddy K who made this point I think that's the one that's the piece of this that we still don't know and that you know Bob Muller who knows more than all of us at this point may be following well and and Mike the question in the morning what is wrong with them it's just like the the Republicans on Capitol Hill that keeps shilling for President Obama's name but he doesn't lie he speaks in hyperbole seriously morons I'll just say it I you know and I gotta go back to what you said Mike because it really is I don't know how to politely say this it's not there they are just not smart they are not intelligent people they are not smart people they bumble around I don't mean to go back to Rudy Giuliani talking about how intelligent he is but who is dumb enough to go on the air give three different accounts of an active case that the Southern District of New York is investigating I mean and who look at Jared Kushner during during transition I mean just blindly going around calling other companies I mean calling other countries that you know they then sought investment from and and bumbling around without talking to lawyers say you know calling Taiwan before you call China and Trump not even knowing that that might be a problem because he just didn't know what he was doing I could give you a thousand different examples of how there was a combination of arrogance and stupidity and we are here where we are today with with a special counsel in large part because of sheer ignorance thinking that the federal government runs the way a crooked in a crooked real-estate operation in New York and New Jersey runs and I'm speaking of trumps right now it's just it's it's insanity yeah Joe I mean you'll get no argument from me and on what you just laid out but there's one other factor I think and we saw it in its own venue just yesterday there is no plan B for Donald Trump in this administration now that he scrapped the Iran Accord there was no plan B on the night of the election when he assumed the presidency they were shocked stunned that they Ellen they had no plan so they didn't know what to do because they never expected to be there and that's where we are today with Iran with North Korea perhaps they have no idea because it's spur-of-the-moment governing okay let's continue the conversation it's so true though still I had up thanks for checking out
