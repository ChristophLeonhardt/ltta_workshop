we're just two days away from the deadline for Donald Trump's lawyers to finish reviewing the last of the documents seized in the Michael Cohen raid while they're checking for anything they can claim might be covered by attorney-client privilege Cohan gave that big interview where he said his first loyalty was to his family though it's unclear whether he's trying to get a plea deal a pardon or pity from the public there's nothing to indicate Jon that Michael Cohen is anything but loyal to this president I think Michaels trying to get out there and send a message to people that he's not a demon baby is a huge shift I interviewed him last August and he said I would take a bullet for the president when the president was on the White House lawn and said I liked Michael Cohen in the past tense yeah Michael Cohen heard that Michael Cohen didn't like it all right so that last comment is really what caught our attention here's exactly what Trump said using the past tense about Michael Cohen I haven't spoken to Mike on a long time he's still your lawyer no he's not my lawyer but a lawyer and I always liked Michael Trump always liked Michael but the question is does he still like Michael and if so how much would me former federal prosecutor in America who worked in the office investigating Cohen and with Cohen's new lawyer by the way former Watergate special prosecutor Nick Ackerman and Tim O'Brien author of Trump nation and executive editor of Bloomberg view great to have all three of you with us here Nick let me begin with you let's play a little verbage if you will what is Michael Cohen thinking when he hears President Trump say things that I would say create distance between him he liked past tense and that he's no longer mylar and he hasn't spoken of in a long time I don't think anybody's thinking here I mean the whole thing is bizarre if this guy were my client I would never ever let him make the statements he did I would have never let him be interviewed by ABC News why because there's nothing good to come out of it I mean if he's trying to really make a deal with Muller and trying to be a witness the last thing he wants to be doing is going out and talking and being in the public he wants his lawyer to go in make a deal give a proper as to what he can offer in terms of who else he can provide evidence against this idea of turning this into a reality TV show which is what all the Trump people do is just mind-boggling this is not the way you run a criminal defense operation and maybe I'm gonna give you a chance to respond to that what do you think I mean you you certainly know mr. Petrillo the the lawyer that is representing Michael Cohen now you know perhaps better than anyone here his insights what do you think of what he's asking him to do to speak to the press in this interview well we don't know if guy Petrillo asked him to speak to her more you know my sense and I'm just cleaning this obviously based on you know different things and reading in the press is that Cohen wanted to talk for whatever reasons I think he probably wants to try to save his public image whether this did that or not you know I'll leave to others to decide but this is his his start of that because he knows the onslaught is coming from Donald Trump and others it's already begun you know the distancing and I think you know Petrillo my guess is he probably did try to advise him not to do it because it's never good from a prosecutor's point of view or from a defense attorneys point of view but that said the interview that Cohen did was not that bad when I first heard he was going to do an interview I said oh you know one of those but it wasn't that bad yeah what do you make of the fact that sorry I'll let you finish that one bad guy he stayed away from answering factual questions he didn't answer the clay set on the advice of my lawyer on mocking to answer whether Trump directed the payment to stormy or whether Trump knew about the Trump Tower meeting and those are the questions that could really get you into trouble down the road you know answering the factual questions expressing his belief of the FBI are not such bad guys things like that this isn't a witch-hunt those are going to ingratiate him to the government I don't think he needed to do that the government's go to talk to him regardless if he wants to talk and they want to listen but you know I don't think he did as much damage as one machine we'd be reading too much into the fact that it's not an on-camera interview that it was done I mean it was kind of like there's different degrees of your interview statement how much you want to go out there's at a prime-time special is it live or is it this kind of you know well giving Emily Jane Fox I heard her say on Rachel Maddow I think last night that it was in and this was my thought that his lawyer that said okay you can do the interview but not on camera because it's a way of controlling it a little more and and doing less damage than he otherwise could yes okay Matt I want to get your reaction to this conversation how do you detect the Michael Cohen interview what has come out of it what its intended purpose was well I'm one of the people in the media that thinks Michael Kohn as a possible vulnerability for president Trump's been overblown I don't think he's the lawyer in the Trump Organization that knew where all the bodies were buried that was Jason Greenblatt you know Trump Hughes Michael Kohn to fix problems like possible liaisons with porn stars he didn't have Michael Kohn inside financial transactions that would be more meaty for somebody like Bob Muller you know it's still not somebody Trump should be worried about is what you're saying well Trump has to worry I think about most of the crew around him because Trump historically have attracted the second and third rate people who probably at the end of the day don't have any loyalty to him when the prosecutors per pressure on them I interpreted what Cohn did the other day as something of a Hail Mary pass I think he's possibly in trouble with tax evasion in New York he's got a taxi medallion business that's going to zero right he's in some financial stress and I think he wanted to sound out whether or not the president was possibly going to pardon him every other time that Michael cone has come into the news cycle Trump has tweeted about him or given an interview about him he was dead silent from Sunday till now so Michael cone has his answer the president doesn't see any reason possibly to pardon him but to be no reason to pardon him and I mean to do this to get a pardon because Donald Trump cannot pardon Michael Cohen from state crimes he cannot pardon him for state tax evasion for money laundering or any other kind of criminal activity that occurred that violates state crimes so that the idea he was sending a message to see if Trump would pardon him I mean just adds to the whole craziness of this thing I mean the only thing I can be sophisticated people that that may be part of the answer I mean the only part of this that even makes sense to me is maybe he was doing this because he was concerned that he was being pressured by the Trump people and he was sending a message that I'm gonna be my own person smoke signals I mean what do you make of the fact that we're approaching this end where Trump's you know lawyer get to finish reviewing the documents what are we expecting to see next in terms of significance of these well I mean certainly the Southern District wasn't gonna file charges until the review process was done because that if nothing else would look unfair right not everybody got to finish their privilege review and they go ahead and file charges that just wouldn't look right so so it's going to remove one impediment to them charging Cohen if that's where they're going and I think that's likely where they're going but you know they also just got you know over a million documents themselves through this review process they've got to get their arms around those documents okay Mulder hold off the Southern District of New York until he makes a decision or do they operate entirely independent like if the Southern District finds that they have something on Cohen and they decide to go forward can Muller's say wait let's see if we can get him to cooperate first do they work in tandem on that front I mean look you always have some coordination and it can be full coordination depends on turf battles I think here given what's at stake namely did the President of the United States act in some criminal way I think there's gonna be a coordination between the Southern District and Muller and nobody's gonna you know start fighting over who should go first Tim I know that you said that Michael Cohen is not somebody necessarily Trump needs to worry about may not know where the the bodies are buried so to speak who should Trump be worried about when he has somebody like Paul Manafort Michael Flynn and to some extent not Michael Cohen that are liabilities anything that was gonna go to whether or not Trump his campaign Trump personally during the election colluded with the Russians to tilt the election to break-in to hack the DNC servers anyone has knowledge of that information is definitely a threat to Trump I think Michael cone exists a little on the periphery of some of that but we do know that he and Felix Sater tried to get a business deal done in Moscow building a Trump Tower there he's intersected multiple times with Felix Sater Felix aiders someone who's a vulnerability to the president around issues like money laundering I don't know that any of them land on the issue of collusion with Russia yeah except the Christopher Steel reports has multiple sources saying that Michael Cohen was in Prague was talking to the Russians about how they were going to hide the hacker that were involved in hacking into the Democratic National Committee and how they were gonna pay them off and put them away in Romania so nobody could find them I think I think it's probably why Bob Muller's is taking his time trying to connect to all of these dots Tim Nick
