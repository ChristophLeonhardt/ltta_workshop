1
00:00:00,089 --> 00:00:05,370
>>DONALD TRUMP'S ICE HOTLINE,
ESSENTIALLY AN 800-NUMBER WHERE

2
00:00:05,370 --> 00:00:08,880
YOU CAN CALL TO HAVE PEOPLE
DEPORTED, IT'S CALLED VOICE, NOT

3
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:14,550
TO BE CONFUSED WITH THE VOICE, A
SHOW ON NBC, THIS IS VICTIMS OF

4
00:00:14,550 --> 00:00:21,900
IMMIGRANT CRIME ENGAGEMENT, THEY
WANTED TO CALL IT VOICE FOR THEY

5
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:26,960
CAME UP WITH THE LETTERS, PEOPLE
ARE USING IT TO DEPORT HER

6
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:27,960
IN-LAWS.

7
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:33,800
ORIGINALLY IT SEEMS
LIKE IT WAS SET UP TO REPORT

8
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:40,070
VIOLENT CRIMES, BUT PEOPLE ARE
USING IT TO DEPORT THEIR

9
00:00:40,070 --> 00:00:41,719
IN-LAWS.

10
00:00:41,719 --> 00:00:45,480
BOING BOING REPORTS A
STUDY DONE FROM THE FREEDOM OF

11
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:54,420
INFORMATION ACT, AND HERE ARE
SOME CALLS --

12
00:00:54,420 --> 00:01:19,789
>>THE NEXT ONE 

13
00:01:19,789 --> 00:01:20,789
IS --

14
00:01:20,789 --> 00:01:28,200
>>THAT LAST ONE IS KIND OF
TERRIFYING.

15
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:31,849
>>THIS IS A TERRIBLE USE OF THE
HOTLINE.

16
00:01:31,849 --> 00:01:32,849
THE HOTLINE SHOULDN'T

17
00:01:32,849 --> 00:01:36,540
EXIST, BECAUSE THIS IS A FORM OF
VIGILANTE JUSTICE AND WE AREN'T

18
00:01:36,540 --> 00:01:44,029
SUPPOSED TO HAVE VIGILANTE
JUSTICE, BUT LET'S SAY SOMEONE

19
00:01:44,029 --> 00:01:48,069
THAT WE REALLY DISLIKE, LIKE
SEAN HANNITY, WE FIND OUT HE'S

20
00:01:48,069 --> 00:01:50,869
REALLY NOT A U.S. CITIZEN, HE
OVERSTAYED HIS VISA.

21
00:01:50,869 --> 00:01:51,869
WOULD YOU

22
00:01:51,869 --> 00:01:53,020
USE THIS HOTLINE?

23
00:01:53,020 --> 00:01:54,460
>>YES.

24
00:01:54,460 --> 00:01:55,899
>>SAME.

25
00:01:55,899 --> 00:01:58,299
I'M KIND OF A HYPOCRITE.

26
00:01:58,299 --> 00:02:03,929
>>EVEN ITS INTENDED USE, ONCE
IT WAS ANNOUNCED, I WAS LIKE,

27
00:02:03,929 --> 00:02:06,439
THIS ISN'T GOING TO GO WELL.

28
00:02:06,439 --> 00:02:09,689
IT'S INTENDED SO YOU CAN BE --

29
00:02:09,689 --> 00:02:12,680
IT JUST INVITES PEOPLE TO GO,
LIKE, THAT GUY HAS GOT A MEXICO

30
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:13,950
ACCENT.

31
00:02:13,950 --> 00:02:17,890
>>THAT IS TOTALLY A STATEMENT
TRUMP WOULD MAKE.

32
00:02:17,890 --> 00:02:18,969
A MEXICO

33
00:02:18,969 --> 00:02:19,969
ACCENT.

34
00:02:19,969 --> 00:02:24,050
HE WAS SPEAKING MEXICAN.

35
00:02:24,050 --> 00:02:29,890
>>I LISTEN TO THIS STUFF, IT'S
LIKE I KNOW WHEN PEOPLE WATCH ME

36
00:02:29,890 --> 00:02:32,599
HERE THEY ARE LIKE EVERYTHING
HAS HAPPENED TO AIDA --

37
00:02:32,599 --> 00:02:35,590
EVERYTHING HAS.

38
00:02:35,590 --> 00:02:37,549
THAT'S WHY I'M A
COMEDIAN SO I CAN COPE WITH MY

39
00:02:37,549 --> 00:02:41,310
TRAGEDY, MY FATHER WAS DEPORTED
THREE TIMES AND IS PROBABLY ONE

40
00:02:41,310 --> 00:02:45,629
OF THE LEAST -- HE'S PROBABLY
ONE OF THE MOST HARMLESS PEOPLE

41
00:02:45,629 --> 00:02:46,629
ON THE PLANET.

42
00:02:46,629 --> 00:02:50,739
IT'S JUST THE
ABUSE TO CONTINUOUSLY HOLD

43
00:02:50,739 --> 00:02:52,870
PEOPLE DOWN.

44
00:02:52,870 --> 00:02:55,310
THESE ARE PEOPLE
THAT ARE RELATED TO YOU IN SOME

45
00:02:55,310 --> 00:02:57,120
WAY, HAVE BEEN RELATED TO YOU.

46
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:58,260
YOU HAVE A CHILD.

47
00:02:58,260 --> 00:02:59,260
THIS IS THE

48
00:02:59,260 --> 00:03:04,190
KIND OF STUFF THAT IS BEING FED,
AN INFECTION THAT KEEPS

49
00:03:04,190 --> 00:03:05,190
SPREADING.

50
00:03:05,190 --> 00:03:07,790
IT WAS HERE, WE SAW
IT WHEN BARACK OBAMA WAS

51
00:03:07,790 --> 00:03:11,430
PRESIDENT, TRUMP JUST BUSTED IT
WIDE OPEN AND NOW THE INFECTION

52
00:03:11,430 --> 00:03:14,319
IS SPREADING ALL OVER THE PLACE,
BUT THIS IS THE KIND OF STUFF

53
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:18,870
THAT HAS CAUSED SO MUCH DIVISION
IN THIS COUNTRY, AND IT'S SO

54
00:03:18,870 --> 00:03:19,870
HATEFUL.

55
00:03:19,870 --> 00:03:21,819
THAT SOUNDS REALLY
HATEFUL.

56
00:03:21,819 --> 00:03:23,450
SO IMAGINE IF ALL

57
00:03:23,450 --> 00:03:28,349
MINORITIES GOT THEIR WHITE
FRIENDS AND SAID LISTEN, BECKY,

58
00:03:28,349 --> 00:03:30,980
EVERY TIME I SEE A WHITE GUY WHO
LOOKS SUSPICIOUS WITH A BACKPACK

59
00:03:30,980 --> 00:03:33,640
I WANT YOU TO CALL THE POLICE
AND REPORT HIM.

60
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:36,150
>>IT'S A FORM OF MCCARTHYISM.

61
00:03:36,150 --> 00:03:38,700
AND THAT IS PROBLEMATIC, TO SAY

62
00:03:38,700 --> 00:03:39,909
THE LEAST.

63
00:03:39,909 --> 00:03:45,579
PROFILING PEOPLE,
GIVING AMERICANS THE GREEN LIGHT

64
00:03:45,579 --> 00:03:50,599
TO GO AFTER INDIVIDUALS AND
THREATEN THEIR WELL-BEING --

65
00:03:50,599 --> 00:03:55,029
IT'S NOT WHAT A LEADER IN THE
GOVERNMENT IS SUPPOSED TO DO.

66
00:03:55,029 --> 00:03:57,390
AGAIN, THE GOVERNMENT IS
SUPPOSED TO PROTECT US.

67
00:03:57,390 --> 00:03:58,390
AND

68
00:03:58,390 --> 00:04:02,620
WHETHER YOU ARE HERE AS A U.S.
CITIZEN OR AN UNDOCUMENTED

69
00:04:02,620 --> 00:04:04,779
IMMIGRANT, EVERYONE IN THE
COUNTRY IS PROTECTED BY THE

70
00:04:04,779 --> 00:04:05,779
CONSTITUTION.

71
00:04:05,779 --> 00:04:10,610
IT PROTECTS ALL OF
US, AND THAT IS SOMETHING A LOT

72
00:04:10,610 --> 00:04:12,209
OF AMERICANS I FEEL LIKE DON'T
KNOW.

73
00:04:12,209 --> 00:04:13,450
AND IF THEY DO FIND OUT

74
00:04:13,450 --> 00:04:15,569
ABOUT IT THEY HAVE A HARD TIME
GRAPPLING WITH IT.

75
00:04:15,569 --> 00:04:16,569
BUT THERE

76
00:04:16,569 --> 00:04:18,620
HAVE BEEN SEVERAL SUPREME COURT
RULINGS INDICATING THAT

77
00:04:18,620 --> 00:04:22,449
REGARDLESS OF YOUR LEGAL STATUS
THE CONSTITUTION PROTECTS YOU,

78
00:04:22,449 --> 00:04:29,039
AND WE SHOULD HAVE COMMON SENSE,
COMPREHENSIVE IMMIGRATION REFORM

79
00:04:29,039 --> 00:04:33,560
INSTEAD OF LETTING PEOPLE LIKE
DONALD TRUMP CONTINUE TO

80
00:04:33,560 --> 00:00:00,000
DIVIDE THE COUNTRY.
