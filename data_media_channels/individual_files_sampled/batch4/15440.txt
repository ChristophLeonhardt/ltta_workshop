misogyny could become the latest form of hate crime in the UK so a review is soon to take place about whether misogynistic conduct should be considered a hate crime the review comes after a Labour MP Stella Creasy called for the law to change the BBC reports on Wednesday MPs approved the voyeurism bill which would ban the taking of unsolicited pictures under someone's clothing known as upskirting in England and Wales proposals to create a new criminal offence which is already on the statute book in Scotland will now be considered by the House of Lords ms Chrissie the MP for Walthamstow wanted to amend the draft law to allow judges to take into account whether people convicted of hate crimes against women should get a tougher sentence if it was motivated by misogyny or if misogyny was deemed to be an aggravating factor okay so let's try and break this down so she's suggesting that in some cases song might take an obscure photo and not being misogynist and in some cases they might take an upskirt photo and they are a misogynist now first off doing this regardless of what your motivation is wrong totally wrong and I think if you're doing it in the first place then it's quite likely that you don't really have much respect for women otherwise why would you be taking an upskirt photograph of them so you see the issue with this what I think this means is that miss Creasy MP is trying to bring in this misogyny sort of element to this bill in order to slip in through the back door new misogyny hate crimes it sets the legal precedent and means that other people might end up in trouble for quote-unquote misogyny and thankfully that was noticed by justice minister Lucy Fraser she said that she agreed with miss Chrissy's concerns but that the voyeurism bill wasn't the right vehicle to change things okay but as sanity great but then she suggested instead that a new hate crime law that tackles misogyny might be a better idea so it could well be that hate crime in hate crime legislation in the UK includes mister Janee from now on and that leads me to a few questions first off who gets to decide what misogyny is are the government going to be bringing in independent advisors from I don't know how not hate the communist groups they regularly associate with especially with documentaries air with so-called experts on the far-right and they go straight to the Communists so who is the government going to go to on misogyny are we meant to be listening to these far-left groups that claim that anyone who says anything negative about a woman is a misogynist I mean can you see why this is the problem here also who gets to decide after you've been you know arrested for your misogyny who gets to decide actually if you did it or not and then we'll jokes be considered misogynist look at what happened to count dank Euler up in Scotland this new hate crime is opening a can of worms that we really don't want to open but if Labour has anything to do with it it will be if you want to see more from me and the rest of the rebel team remember to Like and subscribe you
