THIS PAST WEEKEND WAS THE ANNUAL KOCH BROTHER SUMMIT IN COLORADO SPRINGS WERE SOME OF THE RICHEST PEOPLE ON THE PLANET COME TOGETHER TO EXPLAIN ABOUT COMPLAIN ABOUT HOW HARD THEY HAVE IT. WE WILL BREAK THAT DOWN. ADMISSION FOR THIS WAS A PROMISE TO GIVE AT LEAST $100,000 ñ SO FAR I DON'T KNOW THAT THEIR NAMES HAVE BEEN MADE PUBLIC. LET'S TALK ABOUT SOME OF THE CONCERNS HERE. WE ARE ALMOST ALWAYS HAVING ELECTIONS HERE. HAVE A FEW DAYS WHERE WE ARE NOT. THEY WANT TO GET THEIR POLICY OBJECTIVES DONE AT THAT POINT. THEY HAVE SPECIFICALLY CITED REPEALING OBAMA CARE AND MAJOR TAX REFORM WHICH IS BARELY CODE FOR GIVE US OUR TAX BREAK. SO MAINLY THERE IS ONE GOAL, GIVE US OUR TAX BREAK. LET ME JUST GIVE YOU EXTRA CONTEXT HERE. FIRST OF ALL, I DEBATED AT OXFORD WITH THE PERSON WHO WON THE CITIZENS UNITED CASE. HE MADE THE CASE THAT THIS IS PROGRESSIVES THAT DON'T WANT YOU TO HAVE MONEY ñ HE SAYS THEY ARE TRYING TO DENY YOU A VOICE, THE AVERAGE AMERICAN. YOU HAD TO PAY AT LEAST $100,000 TO GET IN THE DOOR OF THIS MEETING. YOU HAVE TO PLEDGE TO GET IT. AND PRETTY SURE THEY TAKE NOTES ON WHO DELIVERED ON THAT PLEDGE. HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS TO EVEN BEGIN TO AFFECT THESE POLICIES, YOU WOULD THINK THEY AT LEAST HAVE THE DECENCY TO NOT ADMIT THEY ARE THERE. THESE ARE LEGALIZED BRIBES NOW, THEY MAKE THE SYSTEM INHERENTLY CORRUPT. IF YOU ARE WORRIED ABOUT THE CORRUPTION OF BIG GOVERNMENT, WHO DO YOU THINK CORRUPTED THEM? THESE GUYS. NOT ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS. AMERICANS FOR PROSPERITY IS A KOCH BROTHERS GROUP. IT IS FUNDED BY THEM WHO HAVE ABOUT $80 BILLION BETWEEN THEM. SO ANY TAX BREAK FUNDAMENTALLY AFFECTS THEM. THIS GROUP OVERALL, IT AFFECTS BILLIONS OF DOLLARS PER YEAR. SO THE KOCH BROTHERS IN TOTAL PLAN TO SPEND THREE TO $4 MILLION TO BEGIN THIS ELECTION. AND YOU THINK THEY ARE BRIBING PEOPLE OR JUST SPEAKING TO PEOPLE TO THE TUNE OF THREE TO $4 MILLION. BUT THERE ARE MULTIBILLION-DOLLAR RAMIFICATIONS HERE. AND WHY HEALTH CARE REFORM AND TAX REFORM? BECAUSE HEALTH CARE REFORM HAS SIX TO $800 BILLION OF TAX CUTS FOR THE RICH, AND TAX REFORM IS NOTHING BUT TAX CUTS FOR THE RICH. NOW THEY ARE GETTING EVEN MORE BREAKS. 300 TO 400 MILLION, THAT IS A SIGNIFICANT ñ JUST THEM TO COULD FUND A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF ALL THE REPUBLICAN HOUSE RACES IN THIS CYCLE. ALSO IF YOU HAVE 300, $400 MILLION TO SPEND ON ELECTIONS, YOU NEED TO BE FIGHTING FOR MORE TAX BREAKS, YOU CAN SPEND YOUR MONEY. JUST GO ON A YACHT MAN. YOU ARE THINKING TOO SMALL, BUILD A PRIVATE SPACESHIP AND TOUR VENUS. STOP BRIBING OUR POLITICIANS AND GO ENJOY LIFE IF YOU HAVE 80 BILLION. IT'S NOT JUST THAT THE MIDTERM ELECTIONS ARE COMING. I THINK THE BROTHERS ARE ALSO THINKING WE DON'T KNOW HOW LONG THIS TRUMP GUY IS GOING TO LAST, AND WHILE HE IS STILL POPULAR, IT LOOKS LIKE ON THE TAX FRONT HE WILL GIVE US ANYTHING WE WANT. TAKE IT NOW. HERE ARE SOME OF THOSE QUOTES. THAT QUOTE BY ITSELF SHOULD LEAD TO COMPREHENSIVE REFORM. THAT IS YOUR PROOF OF CORRUPTION RIGHT THERE. HE MADE YOUR WHOLE CASE. THEY USED TO TALK ABOUT THE PIGS IN THE TROUGH, POLITICIANS WHO WERE SO CORRUPT. HERE ONE OF THE GUYS WHO CORRUPTED THEM SAYS YEAH, I HAVE A PIGGY BANK. IN THIS CASE IT IS TOTALLY REPUBLICANS, AND THEY ARE GOING OVER THE TOP ON THE TAX CUTS. BUT CERTAINLY IT HAS BEEN ñ AND THE MAINSTREAM MEDIA AND THE DEMOCRATS AND REPUBLICANS WILL SAY ARE YOU SAYING THAT THIS HONORABLE GENTLEMAN HAS BEEN CORRUPTED? YES, THAT IS WHAT WE ARE SAYING. HE IS SAYING IT. THE GUY WHO CORRUPTED HIM IS BRAGGING ABOUT IT. AND YES, ONE OF THE GUYS WHO WAS THERE IS DAVE BRAD, A REPUBLICAN IN VIRGINIA WHO RAN A POPULIST CAMPAIGN AGAINST THE BANKERS IN VIRGINIA TO UNSEAT ERIC CANTOR, THE SITTING HOUSE MAJORITY LEADER. AND ALL OF A SUDDEN HERE HE IS WITH THE BILLIONAIRES. WAIT A MINUTE, YOU ARE TELLING ME THE GUYS VOTED FOR HIM BECAUSE HE HATED THE BANKS AND RURAL VIRGINIA? IF WE DON'T GIVE THEM WHAT THEY PAID FOR, WE WILL SEND THEM ALL HOME. SUPPORT CAMPAIGN FINANCE REFORM TO TAKE THAT WEAPON AWAY. BUT WHY WOULD HE? HE IS AT THE TROUGH WITH PEOPLE WHO PAID AT LEAST $100,000 TO GET THERE. THE TOP DONORS IN THE WORLD. SO NOW YOU KNOW HOW THIS GAME IS PLAYED. IF YOU ACTUALLY WANT REFORM, WOLF ñPAC.COM. YOU HAVE TO GET MONEY OUT OF POLITICS AND YOU HAVE TO MAKE AN AMENDMENT. IF YOU DON'T, THIS WILL NEVER END AND THEY WILL ROB YOU TO THE END OF TIME. BE AN AMERICAN AND GET OUR DEMOCRACY BACK. GET MONEY OUT OF POLITICS NO MATTER WHAT YOU DO. VOLUNTEER, SPEND YOUR TIME, DO WHATEVER YOU NEED TO DO TO GET INVOLVED, BE AN AMERICAN. WOLF-PAC.COM OTHERWISE THESE ARE OUR NEW LORDS THAT RULE OVER US.
