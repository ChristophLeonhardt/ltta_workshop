Christopher Nolan released his latest film Dunkirk on July 24 2017 which means Christopher Nolan will also be all over the award show circuit this year Dunkirk is a unique telling of the miraculous operation dynamo which saved 300,000 British troops from the beaches of Dunkirk during World War two so this movie take home the big prize why is it historical film mired in controversy and it's this movie just fun to watch I've been Davies is pure Allen Christopher Nolan wrote and directed Dunkirk it was made for about a hundred million dollars and grossed over half a billion worldwide it is important note that I think Christopher Nolan is the best storyteller of our time what he may lack in action and spectacle he is a Titan when it comes to narrative reality and letting the human mind be a character in all this fells it is awesome so before I go further spoilers ahead my viewer review is a three out of five now remember I bring my movie reviews into several categories this is just for the general audience that goes into movie to be entertained I know it's about what are they going to think how they believe that's basically my view review it's not as much of an enjoyable film as say The Dark Knight inception or interstellar however you will still be blown away through much of this movie one of the strengths for the viewer is just sitting there is going to be the scope of the film however if you did not see Dunkirk in theaters you missed out on a large portion of it because this movie is shot over 70% in IMAX it's absolutely incredible when you see the screen like that however when you see it on DVD now it's gonna cut off like a good proportion of what Christopher Nolan actually shot but what is amazing about this technique for the viewers is you get to see such a giant picture of these intimate moments you literally feel like you're suffocating in this thing you feel like you're inside of a documentary film almost when you get into a lot of these sequences it's absolutely incredible the score by Hans Zimmer is absolutely powerful and it's inter went through some of the most incredible shots captured with IMAX using these practical effects the real planes these ships always kind of stuff on screen the main reason why this movie won't entertain all the audience not everyone is gonna sit down movie and enjoy it is because it lacks typical story elements that we do often enjoy there's no real love or romance in the movie or any person-to-person action sequences to speak of and there is very little dialogue you literally won't even know the names of almost every character when you walk out of the movie my critic review is a 5 out of 5 this is a masterpiece it's really that simple however will not win Best Picture or probably deserve because of those reasons however I still think he could win Best Director Best Screenplay because of how intricate and complex this whole thing is and because Chris Rowland is just that good a story has never been told or shot like this before for the example the movie is not about one person is about a moment in time it accomplishes capturing a moment in time by showing the story in three different sequences that are also three different time periods there is the mole which is Dunkirk and this is told to the time span of one week there's also the see that is a time span of one day and there is the air which is a time span of one hour it's crazy by doing this it is incredible because you see the war itself more has to be seen through the eyes of the people there but you can't capture everything because every scenario is so different every part of war is so unique another interesting aspect of this film is you never see the villains you never actually see the German advance or the Germans you can see the back of them at one point very variant of the movie this is obviously intentional and this is because it is clearly a commentary on war itself you feel the simple and tremendous fear and frustration without a face much like most of the men in these kind of wars you would most likely never fight them face to face and know who your enemy really is it's this idea as this fear is this constant weight that you're carrying on yourself another element that highlights this movie is just a moment in time is the ending how there's no real crescendo when these men these troops finally get to land they're merely hustle on to a train that is continuously moving forward it is so powerful because the war is not over this was just a moment but now these men have to move forward there's no real heroes necessarily at the end of it another reason why I think this film may not win some major awards is because Christopher Nolan's movies are never that well received by these major award show category Jo kids in fact Christopher Nolan even though his movies are absolutely incredible has only been nominated for Best Picture one time in 2010 that was inception he didn't win there are also some huge complaints about this movie being whitewashed and going to Christopher Nolan intentionally left out people that were Muslim who fought the war or Indians that were heroes in the work which does not apply his movie it's not like I said this was one moment in the war yes the British Army had territories in North Africa and India but they didn't enter the war until after Dunkirk this was mainly the island population that was that was being brought back I mean you could go through all the old pictures of Dunkirk and you might find one person that wasn't an Anglican Brit there's also complaints there weren't enough women in the movie which obviously in World War two there weren't any women serving on the battlefield that's really what this move was about and so they were offended they left this out I don't know and I'm glad Christopher Nolan made these choices because it always bothers me with filmmaker tried to appease the mood of the now when they're trying to tell these stories that are forever these movies are permanent once you get them out there film is literally forever and it should be the best version of your story possible if you remember in darkest hour a great movie that I also praised when I did my review earlier I loved it but there was one character that did feel out of place and that was Winston Churchill's assistant I kept thinking why is this girl that had just met Winston Churchill basically being brought into these bunkers that are top top top top secret and why is Winston Churchill confiding in this girl and not his wife who was a really interesting and awesome character he could have focused on I can I found out why the secretary Elizabeth is based on a real Elizabeth who was Winston Churchill's secretary but not until a year after these events took place so she would have never been involved in all these crazy situations and when you do this you're trying to tell a story that especially realistic and grounded like that it throws you out where you cannot believe that this was actually happen it just breaks up some of your narrative I'm not saying there shouldn't be any girls movie at all like I would have loved to see Winston Churchill's wife be more involved in the movie she's a great character interesting historical figure but I decided to add this girl just to get some brownie points in the now and I think it person who views all faith and values and we give Dunkirk a four out of five there is a very strong theme of sacrifice strung throughout this movie these citizens rally together and their boats to risk their lives to go across the English Channel and save these men trapped in the beaches absolutely heroic amazing to watch the sacrifice is made on the mall as well as in the sky with Tom Hardy's character sacrificing himself to save countless others below him it is magical and powerful to watch what I also loved about this movie was the way they portrayed the enemy yes the villains of this film are literally the Nazis that are moving forward pressing forward killing and destroying parts of Europe but in this film the greatest enemy itself is fear you see this a lot in the men in the mole the deserting the line they're doing anything you possibly can to save yourself to put on other uniforms to try to escape the horrors the constant fear of death that is weighing on every single person on this beach but it is most clear with Kelly and Murphy's incredible performance in the sea part of the movie Kelly & Murphy plays a soldier suffering from shock and PTSD from a ship that had just sunk in the ocean and because of his fear Kelly and Murphy accidentally kills this innocent boy on one of the ships saving him however the brave citizen who was driving the boat the old man knows that Kelly and Murphy character is suffering he sees him slowly start to get over his fears he helps the other men around the boat and he refuses to tell kellyanne's character that the boy has died because he knows it will literally kill him how it wasn't really his fault it was the fear that had taken over him that he was subjected to because the PTSD and the shock and the horrors of war it's really a powerful scene and moment in this movie so if you haven't seen it please go check it out for Oscar season we'll see how it does when no one takes the red carpet here in a few weeks I've been Davey this is pure alley wit all right if you like this video and others like it please consider becoming a premium member to the rebel that way you'll have
