1
00:00:03,250 --> 00:00:05,560
Toyota knows how to make cars.

2
00:00:05,560 --> 00:00:12,140
It does it so well it became the first company
to produce more than 10 million a year.

3
00:00:12,140 --> 00:00:17,680
Its success is rooted in a special system
and began what is now known as ‘Lean Manufacturing’,

4
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:22,560
an ethos emulated by companies around the
world to make products faster, cheaper

5
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:23,620
and better.

6
00:00:32,159 --> 00:00:35,980
Following the Second World War, Japan was
left in a precarious economic position.

7
00:00:35,980 --> 00:00:38,460
"Steel and other metals are scarce"

8
00:00:38,460 --> 00:00:43,690
Already disadvantaged by lacking natural resources,
materials were hard to come by and companies

9
00:00:43,690 --> 00:00:46,190
had to be creative to compete.

10
00:00:46,190 --> 00:00:52,129
Toyota’s founder Sakichi Toyoda had started
a loom business, but it was his son Kiichiro

11
00:00:52,129 --> 00:00:54,420
who founded the motor company in 1937.

12
00:00:54,420 --> 00:00:59,640
They were used to working within narrow margins
- as the shortage of materials increased during

13
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:03,780
the war, the number of headlamps on its Model
K truck was reduced to one

14
00:01:03,860 --> 00:01:06,200
and it only had brakes on one of the axles.

15
00:01:06,380 --> 00:01:11,020
The turning point for Toyota's Production
System would come in the early fifties, when Kiichiro's

16
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:16,580
cousin Eiji would travel to the U.S. with
a veteran loom machinist, Taiichi Ohno.

17
00:01:16,580 --> 00:01:21,040
They visited Ford's River Rouge plant in Michigan
and were impressed by the scale of the operation,

18
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:26,100
but knew that in cash-strapped Japan companies
didn’t have the resources for such a system;

19
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:30,340
Having months’ worth of stock sitting in
a warehouse would tie up precious capital

20
00:01:30,340 --> 00:01:32,110
they didn’t have.

21
00:01:32,110 --> 00:01:37,479
Instead, what truly impressed Ohno was a visit
to a supermarket, a Piggly Wiggly, according

22
00:01:37,479 --> 00:01:42,250
to legend... Japan didn’t really have self-service
stores at this point - and he was struck by

23
00:01:42,250 --> 00:01:46,610
the way customers could choose exactly what
they wanted, when they wanted.

24
00:01:46,610 --> 00:01:51,670
He decided to model his production line on
a similar idea; With a "supermarket formula,"

25
00:01:51,670 --> 00:01:55,860
only enough parts were produced in the first
phase to replace what was used in the second,

26
00:01:55,860 --> 00:01:57,390
and so on.

27
00:01:57,390 --> 00:02:02,820
This is where the ‘Just In Time’ system
really took shape.

28
00:02:02,820 --> 00:02:06,080
Toyota was able to eliminate much of the waste in Ford's system,

29
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:08,539
making
smaller numbers of parts to be used when it

30
00:02:08,539 --> 00:02:12,690
needed them, allowing the company to operate
on a tighter budget.

31
00:02:12,690 --> 00:02:17,200
As part of this Ohno developed ‘Kanban’
- a sign-based scheduling method which shows

32
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:23,030
goods in, goods in production, and goods out.
It’s now seen as a precursor to bar codes.

33
00:02:23,030 --> 00:02:28,030
Ohno and Toyoda also noticed that American
car companies were still employing many of

34
00:02:28,030 --> 00:02:30,599
Henry Ford’s early production techniques
-

35
00:02:30,599 --> 00:02:35,660
They kept operations at full tilt in order
to maximize efficiencies of scale, and then

36
00:02:35,660 --> 00:02:38,760
repaired defective cars after they rolled
off the line.

37
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:44,099
Ohno believed this caused more problems and
didn’t encourage workers, or machines, to

38
00:02:44,099 --> 00:02:45,150
stop making the mistake.

39
00:02:45,150 --> 00:02:51,010
So he placed a cord above every station which
any worker could pull to stop the entire assembly

40
00:02:51,010 --> 00:02:55,209
if they spotted a problem. The whole team
would work on it, to prevent it from happening

41
00:02:55,209 --> 00:02:56,209
again.

42
00:02:56,209 --> 00:02:59,760
As teams identified more problems, the number
of errors began to drop dramatically.

43
00:03:03,020 --> 00:03:07,400
Combined with a culture of continuous, incremental
improvement -- called `kaizen' -- the Toyota

44
00:03:07,409 --> 00:03:12,239
Production System built a brand known for
making reliable and affordable cars.

45
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:15,470
But Toyota was also getting good at producing
cars quickly.

46
00:03:15,470 --> 00:03:19,349
In 1962, the company had produced one million
vehicles.

47
00:03:19,349 --> 00:03:22,909
By 1972, they had produced ten million.

48
00:03:22,909 --> 00:03:27,520
It was around that time the efficiencies of
their factories enabled Toyota to produce

49
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:33,130
a car every 1.6 man hours - much lower than
their competitors in the U.S., Sweden and

50
00:03:33,130 --> 00:03:34,239
Germany

51
00:03:34,239 --> 00:03:39,220
And as the oil crises of the decade sent gas
prices higher, cheap-to-run Japanese cars

52
00:03:39,220 --> 00:03:43,880
became much more appealing to Americans, whose
powerful, but gas-guzzling vehicles suddenly

53
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:47,489
became very expensive to run.

54
00:03:47,489 --> 00:03:52,470
Today, Toyota has made over 250 million vehicles…

55
00:03:52,470 --> 00:03:57,550
Others have looked to them to learn the lessons
of ‘Lean’- combining craft with mass production,

56
00:03:57,550 --> 00:04:01,090
avoiding waste, while striving for constant
improvement.

57
00:04:01,090 --> 00:04:06,610
Boeing is perhaps the most famous, restructuring
a plant to better suit TPS.

58
00:04:06,610 --> 00:04:11,260
Intel is another long-time lean ambassador,
and is exploring the principles in the context

59
00:04:11,260 --> 00:04:13,220
of AI and IoT.

60
00:04:13,220 --> 00:04:17,660
A Canadian Hospital even used Toyota’s system
to decrease wait times in its ER.

61
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:25,120
The Toyota Production System changed not just
how cars are made globally but how we approach

62
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:27,370
making things full stop.

63
00:04:27,370 --> 00:00:00,000
It also showed there is always a better way
to make a product.
