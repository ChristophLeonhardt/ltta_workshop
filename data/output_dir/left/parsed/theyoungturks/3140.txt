WITHOUT FURTHER ADO, LADIES
AND GENTLEMEN --
>>DAMN STRAIGHT. DOWN GOES
FLYNN, DOWN GOES FLYNN. THEY GOT
HIM ON A LITTLE CHARGE, THERE IS
A LOT MORE THEY COULD HAVE
GOTTEN HIM ON BUT THAT'S THE
WHOLE POINT OF A PLEA DEAL, I
GIVE YOU A LITTLE CHARGE, YOU
GIVE ME A LOT OF INFORMATION. OF
COURSE THE BIG QUESTION IS, WHAT
IS A LOT OF INFORMATION? AND
FLYNN COULD HAVE THE MOTHER
LODE. JOHN, MORE DETAILS.
>>WE WILL BREAK INTO LATER ON
OUR SPECULATION OF WHO ELSE
COULD BE DRAGGED INTO THIS BASED
ON WHAT WE THINK FLYNN MIGHT
KNOW, BUT FIRST LET'S BREAK DOWN
WHAT FLYNN ADMITTED TO DOING --
>>OF COURSE, IMPORTANTLY, THIS
IS BEFORE DONALD TRUMP WAS
PRESIDENT, THIS IS DURING THE
TRANSITION PERIOD --
>>SO THEY TALKED TO THEMSELVES,
WHAT SHOULD WE SAY THE RUSSIANS
ABOUT SANCTIONS, THE NEXT DAY
PUTIN MAKES A BIG CHANGE, HE
DOESN'T RETALIATE, BUT SO FAR
IT'S JUST FLYNN AND MAYBE HE
TALKED TO SOMEONE, I DON'T THINK
ANYONE ELSE WAS INVOLVED. BUT
THEN YOU CAN LOOK AT THIS TWEET
--
>>IT CAME OUT THE DAY AFTER
FLYNN'S CONVERSATION ON THE
PHONE. IT SEEMS LIKE HE WAS
PAYING ATTENTION TO THIS ISSUE,
I HAVE A FEELING THEY PROBABLY
LOOPED HIM IN BUT I LEAVE THAT
TO ROBERT MUELLER. WE HAVE SOME
OTHER ISSUES TO DISCUSS BUT NONE
OF THE REASONS THIS IS IMPORTANT
IS ALTHOUGH NOBODY CARES ABOUT
THIS LAW, THAT SORT OF BEHAVIOR
IS TECHNICALLY A FEDERAL CRIME,
IT GOES AGAINST THE LOGAN ACT --
>>THAT IS OBVIOUSLY WHAT THAT
IS INTENDED TO DO, TALKING TO
RUSSIA ABOUT THE OBAMA
ADMINISTRATION'S CHANGES TO THE
POLICY AND THEN TRYING TO CHANGE
RUSSIA'S RETALIATION AGAINST
THAT POLICY. NOW, NO ONE HAS
EVER ACTUALLY GONE TO JAIL FOR
BREAKING THE LOGAN ACT, IT'S A
VERY OLD LAW, IT IS STILL
TECHNICALLY A FELONY, I JUST
THINK IT'S AMAZING THAT SOME
LAWS, EH, IT'S OLD, WHO CARES,
DO WHATEVER YOU WANT.
>>LET'S LAY OUT FURTHER DETAILS
ABOUT WHAT HE COULD HAVE BEEN
CONVICTED ON, AND WHAT HE HAS
PLED GUILTY ON. HE PLED GUILTY
ON LYING TO THE FBI. BUT SINCE
JOHN IS RIGHT THAT MOST PEOPLE
DON'T PURSUE THE LOGAN ACT, IF
HE HAD JUST TOLD THE FBI, YES, I
TALKED TO THE RUSSIAN
AMBASSADOR, AND YES TECHNICALLY
WE ARE NOT IN OFFICE YET, WE
WILL BE IN OFFICE IN ABOUT A
MONTH, BUT I WANTED TO START
NEGOTIATIONS ON BOTH THE
SANCTIONS FRONT BUT ALSO THE
ISRAELI SETTLEMENTS -- FAIRLY
INCONCEIVABLE THAT THAT WOULD
HAVE CREATED ANY KIND OF
CONTROVERSY, THAT THE FBI WOULD
HAVE BEEN LIKE, OH NO, THAT'S A
BIG DEAL. NETANYAHU CALLED TRUMP
AND WANTED TO MAKE SURE THEY
DIDN'T SUFFER ANY INTERNATIONAL
CONSEQUENCES FOR CONTINUING TO
OCCUPY THE PALESTINIANS, THAT IS
AMERICAN POLICY 101. NO WAY
ANYONE WOULD GET INTO TROUBLE
FOR THAT. BUT HE LIED TO THE FBI
ANYWAY, WHICH IS WHAT TRIGGERED
NOT ONLY THE CHARGES, BUT THEN
THE QUESTION OF, WHY? WHY ARE
YOU BOTHERING TO COVER THIS UP?
AND IT TURNS OUT HE COVERED A
LOT OF STUFF UP, AND THERE IS
GOOD REASON FOR THAT.
>>BEFORE WE JUMP INTO MORE
ANALYSIS I WANT TO SHOW YOU ONE
OR TWO VIDEOS, IT HAS BEEN A
ROUGH YEAR -- THIS WILL
HOPEFULLY MAKE YOU FEEL BETTER.
HERE IS FLYNN LEAVING THE
COURTHOUSE AFTER WHAT
HAPPENED THIS MORNING.
>>LOCK HIM UP! LOCK HIM UP! LOCK
HIM UP!
>>JUST IN CASE YOU ARE COMING
INTO THE STORY A LITTLE BIT
LATER AND YOU THINK THAT IS JUST
AN UNRULY MOB, IT'S ACTUALLY A
REFERENCE TO SOMETHING INVOLVING
FLYNN, HERE IS SPEAKING AT THE
RNC THIS LAST GO AROUND.
>>WE DO NOT NEED A RECKLESS
PRESIDENT WHO BELIEVES SHE IS
ABOVE 
THE LAW.
>> LOCK HER UP, LOCK
HER UP!
>>LOCK HER UP, THAT'S RIGHT.
THAT'S RIGHT, LOCK HER UP.
>>I'M GOING TO TELL YOU WHAT,
IT'S UNBELIEVABLE. YOU GUYS ARE
GOOD. DAMN RIGHT, EXACTLY RIGHT.
THERE'S NOTHING WRONG WITH THAT.
YOU KNOW WHY WE ARE SAYING THAT?
WE ARE SAYING THAT BECAUSE IF I
-- I GUY WHO KNOWS THIS BUSINESS
-- IF I DID A TENTH OF WHAT SHE
DID I WOULD BE IN JAIL TODAY.
>>CAN DO, DID DO. SO HE'S NOT
YET IN JAIL, AND BY THE WAY,
EVEN ON THIS RELATIVELY LATE
CHARGE, GIVEN WHAT HE COULD'VE
GOTTEN -- AND AGAIN THAT'S THE
PART OF A PLEA DEAL -- HE COULD
STILL GET UP TO FIVE YEARS IN
PRISON. SO, LOCK HIM UP INDEED.
AND HE DIDN'T DO A TENTH OF WHAT
HILLARY CLINTON DID, HE DID FAR
WORSE.
>>AND YOU CAN UNDERSTAND WHY HE
WOULD TAKE A PLEA DEAL BECAUSE
BASED ON THE CHARGES HE WAS
PREVIOUSLY FACING HE WAS LOOKING
TO SERVE UP TO 60 YEARS IN
PRISON. BUT WHO KNOWS WHETHER OR
NOT HE WOULD GET THE FULL
SENTENCE, THAT IS A SERIOUS
SENTENCE I THINK HE WANTED TO
AVOID. AND ONE THING I WANT TO
QUICKLY ADD, I THINK WHAT YOU
SEE THROUGH THE ENTIRE RUSSIA
INVESTIGATION WEATHER IT
INVOLVES FLYNN OR OTHER
INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE PART OF THE
TRUMP ADMINISTRATION, OR TRUMP
HIMSELF, IS THIS UNWILLINGNESS
TO BE FORTHCOMING, AND WHY? IF
YOU DIDN'T DO ANYTHING WRONG,
WHY DON'T YOU JUST TELL THE
TRUTH THROUGHOUT THE ENTIRE
PROCESS? THEY JUST KEEP LYING
AND HIDING THINGS.
>>THERE ARE TWO POSSIBLE
REASONS FOR FLYNN'S COVERUPS AND
LIES. ONE IS PERSONAL, THE OTHER
ONE IS ABOUT THE CAMPAIGN AND
ADMINISTRATION. HE HAS HIS OWN
MESS WHEN IT COMES TO NOT JUST
THE RUSSIAN GOVERNMENT BUT THE
TURKISH GOVERNMENT -- NOT ONLY
DID HE TAKE ABOUT $500,000 FROM
THE TURKISH GOVERNMENT AND
DIDN'T REVEAL IT, WHICH IS
ANOTHER VIOLATION OF THE LAW, IT
WAS DONE THROUGH A SHELL COMPANY
THAT WAS DUTCH, HE PRETENDED IT
WAS DUTCH BUT HE KNEW IT WAS THE
TURKISH GOVERNMENT GIVING HIM
THE MONEY, THAT IS A MORE
SERIOUS VIOLATION -- BUT WORSE
YET, HE WAS IN A MEETING WITH
TURKISH OFFICIALS WHERE THEY
TALKED ABOUT KIDNAPPING SOMEONE
INSIDE THE UNITED STATES FOR $15
MILLION. NOW, THEY GETS WORSE --
HIS SON WAS ALSO INVOLVED IN
THAT. SO NOT ONLY DID HE FACE UP
TO 60 YEARS FOR ALL THE
DIFFERENT CHARGES, BUT HIS SON
FACED SOME SERIOUS JAIL TIME AS
WELL, AND THAT KNUCKLEHEAD, MIKE
FLYNN, JR., IS ONE OF THE
DUMBEST GUYS IN AMERICA, SO NOT
SURPRISING THAT THAT CLOWN GOT
HIS DAD, ALSO A CLOWN, INTO
TROUBLE, AND TRUMP AS WELL. IF
THEY HAD JUST GOTTEN CONVICTED
ON THE TURKISH GOVERNMENT AND
RUSSIAN GOVERNMENT STUFF HE
DIDN'T ADMIT TO, FOR EXAMPLE HE
GOT MONEY FROM RT TO VISIT
PUTIN, $45,000, AND GOT MONEY
FROM RUSSIAN BUSINESS INTERESTS
ON THAT SAME TRIP FOR ABOUT
22,000 -- YOU THINK HE COULD DO
THAT, JILL STEIN WAS AT THE SAME
DINNER, I DON'T KNOW SHE GOT
PAID, BUT IT'S NOT THAT BIG A
DEAL, JUST REVEAL IT. BUT AGAIN
HE LIED ABOUT IT, HE PRETENDED
IT WAS U.S. COMPANIES THAT PAID
HIM ON THE TRIP. WHY? THAT LEADS
TO, IS THERE SOMETHING ELSE
GOING ON WITH FLYNN AND TRUMP IN
REGARD TO RUSSIA? I THINK THAT
IS THE MOTHER LODE, THAT IS THE
INTERESTING PART HERE. AND
ROBERT MUELLER, WHO IS AN
EXCELLENT PROSECUTOR, BUT GIVE
HIM A PLEA DEAL WHEN HE WAS
FACING ALL THE SERIOUS CHARGES
BECAUSE HE GAVE HIM MEDIOCRE
INFORMATION. FLYNN OBVIOUSLY
GAVE HIM REALLY GOOD INFORMATION
ABOUT PEOPLE HIGHER UP ON THE
CHAIN, PARTICULARLY ONE THAT I
HIGHER UP ON THE CHAIN NAMED
TRUMP.
>>IT'S INTERESTING YOU BRING UP
THE SON, PEOPLE HAVE BEEN
SPECULATING FOR WHAT FEELS LIKE
MONTHS NOW THAT THAT MIGHT BE
WHAT GETS HIM TO FINALLY FLIP
AND ASSIST THE SPECIAL COUNSEL'S
INVESTIGATION. HERE IS FLYNN'S
STATEMENT THAT CANNOT TODAY
WHICH MAYBE GETS INTO THAT A
LITTLE BIT --
>>I DON'T KNOW IF GOD WAS IN
FAVOR OF THE $15 MILLION FOR THE
KIDNAPPING, I DON'T KNOW WHERE
GOD STANDS ON 
THAT --
>>FULL RESPONSE ABILITY FOR THE
ONES I'M NOW GOING TO BE CHARGED
WITH, NOT WITH THE OTHERS,
BECAUSE I'M DOING THE DEAL.
>>AND FOR THE BEST INTERESTS OF
MY FAMILY. NOW, YOU WANT TO HEAR
SOME THING AMAZING? A KIND OF A
HERO IN A ROUNDABOUT WAY, OF
THIS STORY, IS A NEOCON. WHAT?
IT'S A GUY I TOTALLY, UTTERLY
DISAGREE WITH, HE HELPED TO
START THE IRAQ WAR, I COULDN'T
DISAGREE WITH HIM MORE, BUT
JAMES WOOLSEY, FORMER CIA
DIRECTOR, WAS IN THE MEETING
WERE THE TURKISH OFFICIALS WERE
LIKE, YOU WANT 15 MILLION FOR
THE KIDNAPPING AND WOOLSEY IS
LIKE, I WILL SEE YOU LATER. AND
HE TOLD THE GOVERNMENT THAT THE
FLYNN BOYS WERE INTERESTED IN
THAT DEAL, THAT IS PART OF WHAT
GOT THEM IN SO MUCH TROUBLE.
>>THERE ARE A COUPLE OTHER
ASPECTS WE WILL DISCUSS BUT I
WANT TO DRILL DOWN ON ONE THING,
RIGHT NOW WE HAVE THESE
CONVERSATIONS THAT HE LIED ABOUT
TO THE FBI, THAT IS WHY HE HAS
FLIPPED NOW. BUT THIS REALLY
TAKES THE ENTIRE THING FULL
CIRCLE, STARTING WITH THE COMEY
INCIDENTS, HIS FIRING, WHY
MUELLER WAS BROUGHT ON, ALL OF
THAT ORIGINALLY STARTED WITH
FLYNN. SO I WANT TO GO THROUGH A
COUPLE STEPS THAT I THINK REALLY
MAKE THAT CLEAR. UNDERSTAND THAT
THE WHITE HOUSE IS SAYING THAT
NOTHING ABOUT THE GUILTY PLEA OR
THE CHARGE AND LOCATE ANYONE
OTHER THAN MR. FLYNN -- WHICH
THEY ARE ALLOWED TO SAY FOR NOW,
I GUESS. BUT LET'S TALK ABOUT
SOME TIMES --
>>UNDERSTAND, IMPORTANTLY, THEY
DIDN'T CARE ORIGINALLY ABOUT
THAT. THEY THOUGHT, SO WHAT, WE
CAN ALL BE FLIPPED. BUT ANYWAY,
GOING ON --
>>THIS CONVERSATION WITH COMEY
CAUSED HIM TO ORIGINALLY FEEL
THAT COMEY WOULD NO LONGER BE
LOYAL TO HIM --
>>IT IS BELIEVED THAT FLYNN WAS
ALSO INVOLVED IN THE PUTIN CALL.
SO IN THE SPAN OF ONE WEEK YOU
HAVE FLYNN AND PAPADOPOULOS
LYING ABOUT CONTACTS WITH THE
RUSSIANS, YOU HAVE TOTALLY
UNCONNECTED -- BECAUSE TRUMP
DIDN'T KNOW ABOUT ANY OF THIS --
IMMEDIATELY AFTER THEY LIE TO
THE FBI, TRUMP HAS A DINNER WITH
THE FBI DIRECTOR WHERE HE SAYS
HE NEEDS HIM TO PLEDGE HIS
LOYALTY, AND IMMEDIATELY AFTER
THAT TALKS TO VLADIMIR PUTIN ON
THE PHONE. THAT IS A WEIRD WEEK
EARLY ON, IT'S THE FIRST WEEK OF
THE PRESIDENCY.
>>TOO MANY COVERUPS IF THIS WAS
JUST ABOUT, OH, AND THE
TRANSITION WE TALKED TO THE
AMBASSADOR FOR RUSSIA. THERE ARE
TOO MANY COVERUPS FOR THAT,
AGAIN, MUELLER WOULDN'T OFFER A
PLEA DEAL FOR SOMETHING THAT
SMALL ANYWAY. BUT THAT COMEY
CONVERSATION IS SO IMPORTANT,
AND FLYNN FLIPPING IS SO
IMPORTANT, BECAUSE IF IT TURNS
OUT THAT TRUMP ASKED COMEY TO
TAKE IT EASY ON FLYNN BECAUSE
HE'S A GOOD GUY, HE'S MY FRIEND,
WE GREW UP TOGETHER AND ATE
BAGELS FOR LUNCH -- WHATEVER,
SOME ABSURD REASON HAVING
NOTHING TO DO WITH TRUMP'S
COVER-UP -- WELL, THEN IT'S
HARDER TO MAKE AN OBSTRUCTION OF
JUSTICE CASE. BUT IF FLYNN TELLS
THE AUTHORITIES, NO, TRUMP WAS
TRYING TO GET ME OFF BECAUSE WE
WERE COLLUDING WITH THE RUSSIANS
TOGETHER -- OBSTRUCTION OF
JUSTICE. AND TRUMP IS SCREWED.
>>I DON'T KNOW HOW LIKELY IT IS
THAT IT WILL PLAY OUT THAT WAY
BUT I THINK YOU MAKE A GOOD
POINT ABOUT BOB MUELLER BEING A
GOOD PROSECUTOR, AND HE WON'T
GIVE HIM A PLEA DEAL THAT
SIGNIFICANT FOR A LACK OF
INCRIMINATING INFORMATION. AND
REMEMBER, TRUMP JUST FLAT OUT
IGNORED THE WARNINGS FROM YATES,
WHICH JOHN MENTIONED, AND TRUMP
ON SEVERAL DIFFERENT OCCASIONS
TRIED TO GET INDIVIDUALS
INVESTIGATING THIS CASE TO JUST
DROP IT, WHETHER IT WERE MEMBERS
OF CONGRESS THAT WERE DOING AN
INVESTIGATION, OR FIRING COMEY,
THERE IS ALSO ITS A WEIRD SHADY
STUFF GOING ON AND YOU PILE THAT
ONTO THE FACT THAT THEY AREN'T
BEING FORTHCOMING WITH CONTACTS
WITH RUSSIAN OFFICIALS.
>>AS YOU WERE JUST IMPLYING,
EARLIER THIS SUMMER, THIS WAS
BROKEN I BELIEVE YESTERDAY BY
THE NEW YORK TIMES, TRUMP CALLED
SENIOR REPUBLICANS IN CONGRESS
TO GET THEM TO STOP THE
INVESTIGATIONS, INCLUDING
SPEAKING DIRECTLY TO RICHARD
BURR, LEADER OF THE SENATE
INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE PROBE.
BURR AND OTHERS JUST SAY HE
DOESN'T KNOW WHAT IS
INAPPROPRIATE OR NOT, BUT THIS
CONTINUES A MONTHS LONG CAMPAIGN
OF TRYING TO STOP THESE
INVESTIGATIONS. WHICH IF ALL IT
WAS WAS THAT THEY MISREMEMBERED
SOME BENIGN PHONE CALLS SEEMS
LIKE A BIZARRE LEVEL OF INTEREST
THAT HE IS TAKING. EVEN PULLING
COMEY ASIDE AND TALKING TO HIM
JUST BECAUSE HE THOUGHT FLYNN
HAD MISSPOKEN ABOUT SOME
CONVERSATIONS -- DOES ANYONE
ACTUALLY BELIEVE THAT IS WHAT
WAS DRIVING TRUMP NOT JUST TO
FIRE THE HEAD OF THE FBI TO
PROTECT HIS FRIEND, BUT THEN,
AND I REALIZE SO MUCH HAS
HAPPENED, IT'S EASY TO FORGET
THIS STUFF, IMMEDIATELY AFTER, A
FEW WEEKS OR A MONTH AFTER HE
HAD BEEN FIRED, HE WAS TALKING
WITH HIS AIDES ABOUT REHIRING
HIM, APPARENTLY HE MADE A PHONE
CALL TO FLYNN EVEN THOUGH BANNON
TOLD HIM NOT TO, TELLING HIM TO
STAY STRONG, AND IN MARCH OF
THIS YEAR THERE WAS THE LEAK
FROM FLYNN'S TEAM SAYING HE WAS
LOOKING INTO POTENTIALLY DOING
SOME SORT OF DEAL WITH THE
INVESTIGATION. AND AT THAT POINT
THEY SAID HE HAD A STORY TO
TELL, WITH THE IDEA BEING THAT
IF YOU ARE DOING THIS SO EARLY,
WHEN BARELY ANY OF THE
INVESTIGATORY WORK HAD BEEN
DONE, YOU ARE WORRIED THAT NOT
JUST YOU WILL GO DOWN BUT THAT
OTHER PEOPLE HAVE A STORY AS
WELL, AND YOU ARE THE FIRST
TO GET TO THE INVESTIGATORS YOU
MIGHT GO DOWN, WHICH IS WHY HE
MADE THE SEEMINGLY INSANE MOVE
OF MAKING IT PUBLIC THAT HE
WANTED A DEAL BAT
>>THERE ARE TWO LAYERS FOR
TRUMP, ONE IS THE COLLUSION WITH
THE RUSSIANS, IF FLYNN KNOWS
ABOUT THAT, THE SECOND IS THE
OBSTRUCTION OF JUSTICE WHERE HE
TRIES TO STOP THIS
INVESTIGATION. ANA AND JOHN WERE
JUST REFERRING TO THAT. AND
THERE'S A QUOTE FROM DONALD
TRUMP ON TWITTER, WHERE HE SAID
MIKE FLYNN SHOULD ASK FOR
IMMUNITY, AND IT IS A WITCH
HUNT, EXCUSE FOR BIG ELECTION
LOSS BY MEDIA AND DEMS OF
HISTORIC PROPORTION. THERE YOU
ARE COMMITTING OBSTRUCTION OF
JUSTICE IN PLAIN SIGHT, SAYING
TO A GUY UNDER INVESTIGATION,
ASK FOR IMMUNITY. AND WHEN YOU
COULD SOMEDAY GIVE A PARDON TO
THAT GUY, IT'S BASICALLY SAYING
I TRIED TO GET THE FBI DIRECTOR
TO DROP THE INVESTIGATION, HE
WOULDN'T DO IT, NOW YOU ARE
UNDER FURTHER INVESTIGATION, NOW
I'M TELLING YOU PROBABLY TO ASK
FOR IMMUNITY BECAUSE I DON'T
WANT YOU TO GET IN TROUBLE, AND
I'VE GOT YOUR BACK. AND NOW THAT
FLYNN HAS FLIPPED AND IS WILLING
TO GIVE INFORMATION ON WHATEVER
THEY DID INTERNALLY, THE FACT
THAT TRUMP WAS TRYING TO COVER
THAT UP SEEMS APPARENT AND
OBVIOUS. SO EVEN IF THE
COLLUSION CHARGE, WE DON'T KNOW
MUCH YET BECAUSE WE DON'T KNOW
WHAT FLYNN HAS TOLD MUELLER, THE
OBSTRUCTION CHARGES RIGHT IN
FRONT OF US, HE DID IT
PUBLIC LEAD BY THE ONLY QUESTION
WAS, WOULD FLYNN FLIP?
NOW HE HAS, AND THEY WILL
ALMOST CERTAINLY GET HIM ON
OBSTRUCTION.
