21:21 days until the midterms and the key issues Democrats are driving home is Republican is one that Republicans have hammered over the last several election cycles and it is health care The Wall Street Journal lays out the number of political advertisements with mentions of the Affordable Care Act look at all that read back in the 2014 midterms that is the number of Republican advertisements trashing Obamacare fast forward to 2018 look at all the Balu those are all ads the Democrats are running with pro Affordable Care Act messages and health care was front and center at the debate last night in Arizona between the candidates vying for retiring Senator Jeff Flake seat Democrat Kyrsten Sinema and Republican martha mcsalley these two ladies did not hold back the Obama care model doesn't work but when things came to a standstill and we were watching these individuals still not able to get access to health insurance I sat down with my Democrat colleagues in the problem-solvers caucus and we sat down to see if there any way we can find some common ground we cannot go back to a time when people couldn't get coverage when they had pre-existing health conditions so while Martha talks about a working group and part of the problem solvers caucus which I am a proud member of the reality is that we took the vote and during the vote martha voted to repeal these protections here's the good news no matter who wins that race it's gonna be the first woman to hold that seat in Arizona my panel back with me AV Stoddard and congressman Sean Patrick Maloney congressman you are running for re-election you are from a relatively red part of New York State and for a while we have talked about simply running against Trump is not the answer because most people care less about politics than they do about just living a good life is health care and core focus for you absolutely it's it should be a core focus for everybody and not because of the politics but because we do this work to make things better and health care costs too damn much and we have made great gains on coverage but we have not cracked the code on bringing costs down and that is why the reforms the reforms in the Affordable Care Act that are around better outcomes at lower cost are the key and that is where we must focus we must turn health care into technology where we can do more for less every year and we can there's ways to do that but I will tell you when it comes to repealing patient protections that are in the Affordable Care Act like pre-existing condition coverage like keeping your kid on your policy until 26 like ending lifetime caps people live and die by these things and by the way I'd include Medicaid expansion which is critical to fighting the opioid epidemic which is such a terrible problem in my part of New York but also in so many districts around the country this is where the rubber meets the road this is where the political games stop and people's lives and their families are on the line and they get that and the cost is the number one thing for most people most people are just crushed by health care costs and they feel like they're getting less for it and into that vacuum we need to provide solutions and the Republicans have been bankrupt on this and trying to repeal what we've got is not an answer to fixing what's wrong they're bankrupt on it now but Republicans regained control of the house back in 2010 blasting health care it's one of the things President Trump got elected on he talks a big game about for example the economy but when you go to actual states where people are running maybe I don't hear Republicans talking about health care which should be a victory lap or the economy which should be a victory lap know they this is a sleeper issue of this campaign the Democrats are not running an impeachment they are running on health care Republicans are not talking about it because they didn't repeal to replace it with anything better and they don't have an answer to the fact that premiums are spiking particularly this month before people go to the polls they have been for years they're getting worse but also because the individual mandate is gone that has actually made the pools sicker and even more expensive so this is a huge vulnerability for Republicans they know it they thought they were gonna have a tax reform law to talk about but guess what health care is now Obamacare the Affordable Care Act is now more popular than the Republican tax reform law an internal poll by the Republican National Committee weeks ago saw by 60 to 31% voters believe it only benefits the wealthy and big corporations and they admitted we have lost the messaging battle on this tax cut so they talked about the economy they don't talk about health care they don't talk much about taxes and they talk a lot about sanctuary cities because of that gains traction in some areas for them the is not the campaign plan that they told us they were okay but there's a very big difference when the president talks about the economy what he's actually talking about congressman is the stock market and one of the things that's caused the stock market to boom is tax cuts when you give corporate America double the amount of money on their balance sheet you're going to see stocks go up so take me local is the economy an actual winning issue because if you don't on stocks I don't see that much look I wouldn't underestimate the fact that people feel better about the economy we do we should celebrate that but some of us who are adults have to say if you pour stimulus on a pretty good economy already you're gonna get a short term pop I mean I could have done 1,000 infrastructure projects the size of the Tappan Zee Bridge with the debt the president took on that tax cut so which would you think would create more growth a thousand infrastructure projects the size of the Tappan Zee or this now called the Mario Cuomo thank you in New York in New York we have also lost our state local property tax deductions in large measure we are also facing the end of the individual mandate which by the way was part of the tax but a lady makes a great point those things are actually joined at the hip and the fact of the matter is is that the economy is doing well right now but what some of us want to do is grow down our debt and deficit do long term investments in real middle-class job creation in the infrastructure is part of that but only part of that training up our workers redesigning our education system for the 21st century I mean there's a lot of work to do and it's not an answer to say we're gonna get a pop for a while with massive debt looming the deficit is 800 billion now and growing we're gonna have two trillion-dollar annual deficits in a couple of years that's what's happening and we are gonna have to fix this at some point well then we're gonna see what people are going to vote for we are living in a short-term world the long-term solutions be what people vote for hey there i'm chris hayes from MSNBC thanks for watching MSNBC on youtube if you want to keep up to date with the videos we're putting out you can click
