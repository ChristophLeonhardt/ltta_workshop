hello I'm Max Keiser this is the Kaiser report the show that goes where no show dares to go and then come back again and then go back Stacy yes we've continued to stay in Vegas we have not left I don't know if we'll ever leave but we're still here and the party continues here in Vegas it's always the party but the qqe party is over have you ever heard of qqe I think that's the nasdaq etf no it's qualitative and quantitative easing that has been happening in Japan but that party is oh-fer talk on it nobody has noticed this except for wolf street calm they notice that the party's over everybody's been talking about the Fed doing the quantitative tightening they're starting to ease back I think it's something like their their balance sheet is shrunk by two hundred and eighty five billion dollars but over in Japan where they've had something like 30 years of quantitative easing and then they abenomics came along and they jumped it up to Q&A t'v and quantitative economic easing QE party is drying up even at the Bank of Japan despite repeated speeches to the contrary as of September 30th total assets on the Bank of Japan's elephantine balance sheet dropped by five point four trillion yen which is thirty three billion dollars from a month earlier to 537 trillion yen or four point eight seven trillion dollars four point eight seven trillion dollars is the Bank of Japan's balance sheet and they said it was the fourth month-over-month decline in a series that started in December this is what that looks like here's the total Bank of Japan total assets that's a little scoop down that it's had but this is where Abe anomic begins that's the qqe and that is in 2013 yeah that means credit freeze potentially so in 2008 he had a global credit freeze and then we had a phenomenon in Japan because of their rates being close to zero point O 1% as being the world's first stop to borrow and then reinvest in low yielding securities to real iqua fie the global balance sheet of the global banks in this huge carry trade as it's called and this extended and pretended as if the banks were not insolvent from 2008 to 2018 but now in 2018 if there's a credit freeze like there is happening in Japan if interest rates start to go up because banks aren't lending to each other then the kimono is opened and the revelation is seen by all that all these major banks in Japan Deutsche Bank in America are insolvent and that they'll once again come to the central banks and say we need QE for we need another bailout we need twenty five trillion freshly printed US dollars or we're going to go into a massive recession and if so facto that's not going to happen because the interest rate environment now after 32 years ago in two a secular bear market for bonds which means a secular move and interest rates higher that could last five to ten years we're heading into bond nuclear winter the bond winter the bond pocalypse and Japan could go under it could go worse than Fukushima they could go worse than Godzilla they could go worse than freakin you know bad sushi on an empty stomach well actually I'm gonna skip ahead to the conclusion that Wall Street offers because of course some might say Oh China Japan will face a debt crisis but they can't face a debt crisis essentially because they have too much savings in cash Japan by far the most over indebted country in the world in relationship to its economy has decided that there will be no debt crisis a debt crisis would force Japan to brutally cut its budget for Social Services and raise taxes by large amounts to make ends meet Japan has decided that it would never come to that instead there may be a currency crisis or an inflation crisis or both which would spread pain more evenly yeah 30 crises to the end say the end is going to be inflated a way to make sure that these banks don't go under which means that that carry trade of the basis on the yen the cost goes up even by one tenth of one percentage point thus making an enormous amount of the multi quadrillion dollar derivatives market instantly insolvent so this has always been the point it's like a you know to mix metaphors even more that Tokyo is kind of like the chernobyl of the global financial markets and it looks like it's blowing right now it's a Mount Vesuvius it's another metaphor it's it's another analogy I've run out of analogies just to put it into context because remember the United States government mostly the weather I'm sorry not the United States government but the Fed has bought mainly government bonds and government backed bonds like Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and a higher quality stuff the Bank of Japan has been buying stocks ETFs equities all sorts of stuff but again to put this into context what we've seen with a Bonomi and if they're unwinding this the BOJ has been buying mostly Japanese government securities JGBs and short term bills but also equity ETFs Japanese REITs the real estate investment trusts and corporate bonds Japanese government securities are the largest asset class on the balance sheet by now the BOJ has a part about 50% of all outstanding Japanese government debt from about 14% in late 2012 right so this means that the government prints money the yen then they use that money that they print to buy back their own bonds and their own stocks and that's called debt monetization and if you look up definition of Banana Republic it'll say this is a freaking banana republic because if they're buying their own debt but in Japan they call it quantitative easing not debt monetization with the canard that well it's temporary but it's been 30 years now and it's never going to go away and now the Reaper must be made the grim reaper of the bond market has appeared with his with his sky and he's looking at the global bond market and he's gonna end it Saban pocalypse it's it's a tsunami of bad paper and it's gonna be the greatest financial collapse ever I love it of course the bond pocalypse is something that has been a great Widowmaker many people have been waiting for this for decades because we're we're in a 30 something year bull market and bonds and it everybody always promises it's about to finally collapse but maybe it might be that time now but you know what I want to also say that it seems to go on forever and ever is another article I saw in the past week or so which is about a hard never ending presence in Afghanistan because of course we first went bankrupt as a nation in 1971 when we couldn't pay for the war in Vietnam we were founded because of that you know no taxation without representation that was actually in nineteen eighteen sixty five 1860 1765 when the our monarch the British Empire was basically bust for from after several wars and they needed some taxes to you know attack never-ending Wars tend to end empires so if the dollar and the US dollar bond and all its minions through the you know the Japanese bonds and stuff like that if this is all following apart if that you know Empire debt around the world does collapse we are still in Afghanistan and it would be quite fitting because Afghanistan has been not a Widowmaker but a you know an empire the death of empire has been a murder of Empires for many for the past hundred years or so WT are we still doing in Afghanistan spending forty five billion dollars a year and Eric Prince wants every dime a parent Eric Prince is back and this guy never goes away he's always there with a mercenary army ready to go in and he's proposing quite something quite amazing so according to the Senate Subcommittee on federal spending oversight we are spending about forty five billion dollars a year in Afghanistan about 1 billion of that amount is spent for economic aid to Afghanistan and 5 billion is being spent on Afghan forces according to the report that leaves 13 billion dollars we're currently spending on the US military forces in Afghanistan and 26 billion on so-called logistical support it's that thirty nine billion dollars that Eric Prince has his eye on so he wants to send in two thousand five hundred of his own special forces to replace 15,000 American military troops who you know by the way have the whole backing of the US military and the Navy but he's somehow gonna do it on the cheap with these 2,500 mercenaries collect the full amount the thirty-nine billion that we're spending now but he says he's gonna reduce the bill for the American population oh yeah well the price of genocide is up apparently cost 39 billion of Eric prince commit genocide hey you know Afghanistan of course is the number one source for lithium and that's why America stays there because collectively the population is going insane and they need that lithium just to keep themselves balanced for another day the other interesting thing there is that what he wants to send in 2,500 troops replace our military but he also proposes that his force of 6,000 private contractors in total that would be there would be supported by air through a fleet of contracted aircraft flown by joint teams of afghans and contractors according to the times this is a curious one as well he's got he's alleging that he is some sort of private Air Force that he could call upon which is probably a quite expensive component of our entire military apparatus is the you know the air the aircraft and the aircraft I suspect Eric Prince in fact died and has been reanimated in a videogame and with a little artificial intelligence at it as gone rogue so the avatar of Eric Prince in this video game atmosphere of warcraft is dictating terms to a supine US military Pentagon budget administrator and authorizing tens of billions of dollars to Imaginary Forces to go get that lithium why because he's insane it's Apocalypse Now to the root of Apocalypse Now this makes Harvey Keitel and you know Bad Lieutenant look like The Flying Nun well I mean I also want to point out in the last minute here that we also have the fact that Pakistan has gone to the IMF for some more money billions of dollars they need Pakistan and Afghanistan but particularly Pakistan are quite crucial to that China's belt and road policy and that is you know you have to look at the long term we as a nation don't have economic policies beyond the next trading day but political and military policy they are looking at long term and long term they only see China so if they're you know if they're why we might be there it might not be about saving taxpayers money like Eric prints things it's more about containing China containing China it all seems to come back to containing China oh well okay let's take a break and when we come back let's do more good stuff welcome back to the concert I'm Max Keiser time now to turn to Susan pool we're gonna find out more about Susan Paul Susan pool welcome Thank You max keiser and I'm delighted to be here oh it's fantastic you know we I've been seeing you now for years and years wherever I go in the crip of space there is Susan pool well there you go then so what what are you doing in this space isn't yeah I'm doing a lot of different things I worked for you know corporate America in the software industry and I got in a Bitcoin a few years ago and I literally went all-in with my career of create a whole new career I work for myself I do advisory consulting does that ever happen to you before in your career where you just literally got swept off your feet and just committed yourself wildly to something like that is it a new thing if that's ever happened before it's a brand new thing and you know I was in the software industry I missed the wave of social media I missed Google I heard about Bitcoin I'm like this is why I missed those to go into Bitcoin all in you know I believe that there's something on the aesthetic side of Bitcoin where it's very beautiful the way that the incentives are balanced and the way that it tends to turn everyone into a maximalist and do you feel that as well in other words you were in the software industry understand technology but where as a human being were you attracted to what I would call the aesthetic of Bitcoin your thoughts on this idea I absolutely was my motto at the beginning and I loved mine that I was a bit naive I recognize now it was banking the unbanked right for me Bitcoin was banking the unbanked it was probably the first presentations I heard in an event and I realized like I could be part of something that can change people's lives you know software changes people's lives but this is on the one on one situation and I thought naively like that's that's hat thats gonna happen like everywhere now almost which is so silly I was just so hopeful at starry ice and now you know a couple years later I see the infrastructures the technologies that distributor apps being built that hopefully will enable that and and such types of applications and uses for the most disadvantaged people in the world yeah this huge idea that oh yeah Bitcoin can help to disadvantaged people of the world and then there's a huge group of disadvantaged people in the world called Americans and they've been cut out of hard money now since 1971 and there are millions of them in dire straits living in abject poverty without any health services and what about right here in America there seems to be a blockade against allowing people to have individual sovereignty and access to hard money like Bitcoin what about right here in the good old USA Susan pool how are we going to get this message through okay well I want to give you like up my two sentences out on the state of what it is why it is that way um you know my whole career was in like sales and business development and and somebody was either seeking to solve a problem or to get rid of a pain I don't see a lot of people understanding like how to get rid of the pain of that and with Bitcoin yet so there's a gap there all right so the good point so in marketing you're either escaping the pain or seeking to solve a problem pleasure seeking pleasure or going away from pain essentially is the essence of sales and Fabriano TV you're either it's either you know headache medicine or getting a sexy car exactly the bifurcation those are the the two roads toward marketing so as applies to Bitcoin it's not obvious what problem it solves at the moment because people are very happy with that money very happy with credit cards very happy with the system the inflation is somewhat dulled it's only one or two percent a year okay and lose 97 percent over 100 years but over five years you don't really notice it so you don't have the urgency but what about countries like Venezuela Argentina where they do have the urgency and they aren't quickly adopting Bitcoin and hard money so I guess that would that would be your point is that they've got the urgency that they're getting they're escaping there the pain you feel I mean their pain could be death their pain is the worst pain ever their pain could be starving even though we do have quite a disadvantaged part of our society in America or though people in individuals in America there's food pantry you know there is it's a bit different and i think you know ii personally motivate yourself there's you can motivate yourself but then life can motivate you and in those countries their governments are motivating them for urgency now with that coin speaking of different governments so you are part of an EU regulatory forum how does the EU compare to the US or are they just looking to the US for guidance well this is a great topic because you know you probably know this as well but every country in the world wants to be thee or every entity every country domain and whatever wants to be the entity where they get the most out of blockchain and Bitcoin right and so just like many Americans complain that a lot of Technology is going to leave the country because of regulations or a lack of regulations Europe is looking like that Korea is looking like that and everybody wants to have the landscape for infrastructure builds and lead the way and so Europe is no different than any other entity like that well yeah there are a number of countries that are buying to become quote Bitcoin Switzerland including Switzerland yes so you have Malta you have quad Rico Switzerland different territory what do you see on the regulatory front what countries are doing the right thing they're doing it right and will attract the critical mass and who's obviously getting it wrong well I would say most of the conversations I have with people is that they're Americans are concerned that America is going to get it wrong and having worked in a prior role I got really exposed to just how much learning is required for people in a regulatory structures to catch up to all of us who've been in this industry immersed right so they're still managing their current monetary systems and now to try to catch up so it's hard let me jump in for a second because in America regulations are not necessarily an impediment to growth for example uber violator all kinds of regulations and they became a billion dollar company sure you have other companies like like uber and gig economies Oh Airbnb right they're there they're not there they're flouting all kinds of regulations and they become a billion dollar industry so in the finance space people don't abide by regulation and they create for example the merger of Citigroup and the Travelers Insurance Corporation was illegal at the time but they changed the laws to accommodate it in the after it was consummated so why wouldn't we see in Bitcoin just oh you know Danton dark damn the tuxedos full speed ahead forget the regulations we're just going to take this to where we need to get it and let the but let God sort it out well then it's such a great question and I believe the major differentiator there is that those were centralized entities for profit and Bitcoin as we know being decentralized like who is though we to lead that charge all of us are doing it individually by being involved in it I used to co-teach Oh Bitcoin wallet classes for free on Saturdays here in Las Vegas just to do my bit of like showing people what a multi-sig well it is you know so if that scales to everyone we could all collectively have that course but I don't see the force in those kind of things where two large entities merged or somebody built a an uber that just kind of went viral I'm Bitcoin so it's just a bit different to me so right so where does this leave regulations in this space are they going to need to create new regulations as some have suggested just for this new asset class or will crypto somehow fit into the current scheme well I think if I had that answer very popular you see the tea leaves reading the tea leaves thank you okay I like that question well I have a lot of context in DC and the SEC right now is very open to people with entities like coming in and talking to them you know they go in with their lawyers and they're saying we're thinking of doing this so they're open to information the regulatory structures I believe yet sorry I forgot the question that's okay I'll repeat and summarize as I would being the professional journalist okay I'm not so in other words you got your ear in DC and they're open to hearing they're talking to folks at the SEC and they are trying to I think be at the same time accommodative of this new industry but they've got to adhere to Securities Act is 33 and 34 as I have said many times before technology people come to me I'll answer the question technology parrot come to me and they say my interpretation of the securities law is that we have figured out how to bypass it with saft or some something else right I'll say you know it's not up for you and your interpretation of securities law it's up to the SEC and their interpretation of securities and they've come down quite hard and said you know what there's nothing Jay Clayton said there's no I cos that he's saying that's not a security that's pretty clear that he's now believes that the SEC has dominion over every single and they're out there pulling back on these I cos they're their people have to send the money back what's your take on the ico boom of 2017 I mean what did you think when you were seeing that I was completely stunned I had people from all over the world contacting me on LinkedIn saying we'll give you a hundred thousand tokens if you'll like pump our ico and I turned down a hundred percent of them I try to put things simply like if my family was gonna get ripped off by this would I want to even think of doing it and I didn't have time to vet any of them so I just want a hundred percent no um but what's the weirdest question is why do we never hear about all the people who lost all their money and icos or all their bitcoins I never hear them complaining anywhere do you well this is known on financial circles that people who are victims you know tend to stay quiet because it's not something you want to make you know brag about but on the other hand we have the SEC because putting pressure on IC o companies and offerings they are quietly returning all the cash and this is happening in dozens of businesses now all the cash is being returned and we also have instances where companies are converting the token into equity nice a lot going on I've always asked that question because I'm thinking like I'm sure people I know have a debt situation but they don't talk about it and I also want to say obviously there's some great innovation through some of these icos and you know it's hard to tell which ones are good and which ones are fake or which you require an enormous amount of due diligence and you know you get like a 30 or 40 of these pitch decks in a day it's really and you know it's not gonna happen so do you spend a lot of time in Vegas you Vegas I spent a lot of time here I have a few places where I hang my hat because I traveled so much and yeah I was gonna mention what everything on I see oh so now I'm getting what's what I like about this year is now I'm getting entities coming it coming to me that our public companies saying you know we're interested in you being an adviser because you have a network of service providers and can you connect us and we trust you or someone you know what I mean and so that's exciting for me now I'm interested in those I'm interested in those I have one that's a CEO took a company public he wants to tokenize something in his vertical market I'm like wow so great so you know it's kind of like the next wave in my view of the tokenization and the icos okay so according to Susan pool we have entered a new wave in the ICO and tokenization market which is now the experimentation phase is behind us we seem to be getting into a more institutional friendly marketplace and so this form of fundraising is seems to be not going to go away would you say that's a fair statement I don't see it going away I think the regulations will play a role in who is going to do it I mean do you have to be highly financially savvy or do you have to be tech savvy so who's gonna do those icos will change depending on regulations and where they're done but also I want to say um you know it's interesting that corporations you know in America are interested in digital assets and tokenization and now they're coming to this community to say who do I talk to where do I go and I mean publicly traded companies you know the master national baseball league is offering tokenized bobble heads as to people who come to the park and it's a huge hit and as something like that could really force adoption anyway we're out of time Susan Poole thanks for being on the Kaiser report well thank you very much all righty that's gonna do it for this edition of the Kaiser reports being nice cause receipts you ever want to think I guess to cool do you want to catch us on Twitter its Keiser Report till next time bye Oh
