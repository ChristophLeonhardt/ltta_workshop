00:00:13,259 --> 00:00:15,179
old jobs and houses blah blah blah<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

9
00:00:15,179 --> 00:00:17,400
sport<font color="#E5E5E5"> has been absolutely incredible and</font>

10
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:18,720
it had me thinking a lot about the

<font color="#E5E5E5">ladies survey again I think I've watch</font>

12

about two-thirds<font color="#E5E5E5"> the responses now but I</font>

13
00:00:22,170 --> 00:00:23,609
<font color="#CCCCCC">still want to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> watch all of them that I</font>

14
00:00:23,609 --> 00:00:25,199
<font color="#CCCCCC">can find but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> there are so many people</font>

15
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:26,699
who don't have<font color="#E5E5E5"> a favorite female athlete</font>

16
00:00:26,699 --> 00:00:28,260
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> i know that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i started this before</font>

17
00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:29,460
the olympics there may be some people

18
00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:31,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">have a favorite former athlete now but i</font>

19
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:32,820
think that<font color="#E5E5E5"> even if you don't really like</font>

20
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:34,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">sports it's really worth just watching</font>

21
00:00:34,710 --> 00:00:37,140
one hour<font color="#E5E5E5"> or</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> two hours of the olympics by</font>

22
00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:38,670
the end of<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you will probably have a</font>

23
00:00:38,670 --> 00:00:40,559
favorite female athlete the women had

24
00:00:40,559 --> 00:00:42,270
been absolutely incredible and it was

25
00:00:42,270 --> 00:00:44,040
very apparent on the sunday of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> road</font>

26
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:45,870
race when it was admittedly a bit

27
00:00:45,870 --> 00:00:48,270
Rainier and a bit less nice but I stood

28
00:00:48,270 --> 00:00:49,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">in the same position to the outgoing in</font>

29
00:00:49,860 --> 00:00:51,360
the incoming on the richmond bridge and

30
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:53,070
then on the curb at richmond park there

31
00:00:53,070 --> 00:00:54,420
were far fewer people and funnily<font color="#CCCCCC"> enough</font>

32
00:00:54,420 --> 00:00:56,340
that was the<font color="#E5E5E5"> event we're Team GB won the</font>

33
00:00:56,340 --> 00:00:58,289
first medal it was so exciting they want

34
00:00:58,289 --> 00:00:59,760
a silver<font color="#E5E5E5"> medal with Lizzy Armstead who</font>

35
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:02,039
came to whizzing right past me second

36
00:01:02,039 --> 00:01:03,420
only to Marianne Vos from the

37
00:01:03,420 --> 00:01:05,280
Netherlands<font color="#E5E5E5"> Mary I'm losses like a beast</font>

38
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:07,049
of speed but it was thrilling and

39
00:01:07,049 --> 00:01:08,369
terrifying as<font color="#CCCCCC"> well as they came around</font>

40
00:01:08,369 --> 00:01:09,630
the curve because it been raining so

41
00:01:09,630 --> 00:01:11,070
much so we thought everyone was going to

42
00:01:11,070 --> 00:01:12,600
slip over and then in the evenings on

43
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:13,710
the television I've been<font color="#E5E5E5"> watching a lot</font>

44
00:01:13,710 --> 00:01:15,509
swimming a lot of the arterial to the

45
00:01:15,509 --> 00:01:17,460
hockey I hate hockey I've always hated

46
00:01:17,460 --> 00:01:18,990
while keeping<font color="#E5E5E5"> the head clear at school</font>

47
00:01:18,990 --> 00:01:20,759
but watching it is something<font color="#E5E5E5"> else is</font>

48
00:01:20,759 --> 00:01:22,170
speed and the power<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the Olympic</font>

49
00:01:22,170 --> 00:01:24,780
athletes is just wow even if it's just

50
00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:26,070
what<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know watched before in your</font>

51
00:01:26,070 --> 00:01:27,960
life like archery or like fencing than

52
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:29,880
you you very quickly learn how to<font color="#CCCCCC"> score</font>

53
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:31,409
that's especially<font color="#E5E5E5"> a case i think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font>

54
00:01:31,409 --> 00:01:33,390
gymnastics and diving when you start to

55
00:01:33,390 --> 00:01:34,979
get an idea of what is a good and

56
00:01:34,979 --> 00:01:36,750
blessed good school one of the best

57
00:01:36,750 --> 00:01:38,189
events<font color="#E5E5E5"> i've watched by far was the</font>

58
00:01:38,189 --> 00:01:40,259

61
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:47,310
not quite alike but quite fine oh she

62
00:01:47,310 --> 00:01:49,049
was a<font color="#E5E5E5"> very powerful swimmer so my task</font>

63
00:01:49,049 --> 00:01:50,549
for you guys this week is to watch like

64
00:01:50,549 --> 00:01:53,009
one or two<font color="#CCCCCC"> hours of the Olympics chances</font>

65
00:01:53,009 --> 00:01:54,540
are you have a favorite female athlete

66
00:01:54,540 --> 00:01:55,799
by the end of them they leave that

67
00:01:55,799 --> 00:01:57,689
athletes name of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> coins and also tell</font>

68
00:01:57,689 --> 00:01:58,770
me<font color="#CCCCCC"> if there are any sports that you</font>

69
00:01:58,770 --> 00:02:00,450
watch the meter thick huge enjoy<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you</font>

70
00:02:00,450 --> 00:02:02,670
actually did enjoy or vice versa the

71
00:02:02,670 --> 00:02:04,049
other big thing for me yesterday was the

72
00:02:04,049 --> 00:02:06,000
diving sites and dances certain tariffs

73
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,560
so a more difficult dive will have a

74
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:07,900
high

75
00:02:07,900 --> 00:02:10,060
and then you get marked on execution it

76
00:02:10,060 --> 00:02:11,800
was a synchronized IV as well as and the

77
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:13,600
wonderful amazing<font color="#E5E5E5"> Mexican diamonds</font>

78
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:15,130
really just blew it out of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> water</font>

79
00:02:15,130 --> 00:02:16,810
basically chose to do leave of crazy

80
00:02:16,810 --> 00:02:19,240
high<font color="#E5E5E5"> tariffs like difficult</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> dives got</font>

81
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:20,650
laser points and ended up with a silver

82
00:02:20,650 --> 00:02:22,210
medal which was amazing and even there

83
00:02:22,210 --> 00:02:23,860
was sad that Tom and pizza for Team GB

84
00:02:23,860 --> 00:02:25,870
was squeezed out and putting forth I was

85
00:02:25,870 --> 00:02:28,000
so so proud of Mexico I love seeing

86
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">let's go compete because they do get so</font>

87
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:30,670
much crap and there's so much

88
00:02:30,670 --> 00:02:32,380
stereotyping actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> during the women's</font>

89
00:02:32,380 --> 00:02:34,480
road cycling the Mexican woman<font color="#E5E5E5"> Ingrid</font>

91
00:02:36,820 --> 00:02:38,530
our flag but she looked right at us and

92
00:02:38,530 --> 00:02:40,510
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> was just so exciting I'm gonna still</font>
