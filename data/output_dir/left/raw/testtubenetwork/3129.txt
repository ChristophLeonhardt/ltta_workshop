1
00:00:04,270 --> 00:00:08,090
Over the past few years, the United States
and China have grown considerably closer.

2
00:00:08,090 --> 00:00:12,601
However they have simultaneously, and repeatedly
voiced grievances about each other’s economic

3
00:00:12,601 --> 00:00:13,660
and military actions.

4
00:00:13,660 --> 00:00:18,699
Some US officials have been particularly vocal
about their distrust of China, and polls from

5
00:00:18,699 --> 00:00:23,590
2014 show that more than half of Americans
hold unfavorable views about China.

6
00:00:23,590 --> 00:00:27,870
Yet, it is no secret that China is a major
key to a number of US goals.

7
00:00:27,870 --> 00:00:30,700
So, why does the US need China?

8
00:00:30,700 --> 00:00:35,200
Well, among its chief complaints, the US is
concerned about Chinese manipulation of its

9
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:39,660
currency, as well as the extreme difficulty
American manufacturers face when trying to

10
00:00:39,660 --> 00:00:41,620
establish businesses in China.

11
00:00:41,620 --> 00:00:45,940
There is also little intellectual rights enforcement,
and even international hacking rings with

12
00:00:45,940 --> 00:00:47,640
ties to the Chinese government.

13
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:52,420
Moreover, the US’s recent naval incursion
in the South China Sea have raised questions

14
00:00:52,420 --> 00:00:57,200
about the US’s role in defending countries
with claims to the region, including China.

15
00:00:57,200 --> 00:01:02,280
But realistically, the US is incredibly dependent
on China’s economy, and vice versa.

16
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:07,250
China is the largest exporter of manufactured
products into the United States, so any inflation

17
00:01:07,250 --> 00:01:11,179
within China would immediately hurt American
consumers.

18
00:01:11,179 --> 00:01:15,610
China also imports huge amounts of capital
from states like California, where exports

19
00:01:15,610 --> 00:01:19,409
have risen to $22 billion dollars as of 2012.

20
00:01:19,409 --> 00:01:24,799
China is also the largest purchaser of US
Treasury Bonds, roughly $1.3 trillion dollars’

21
00:01:24,799 --> 00:01:29,990
worth, and by extension, a significant portion
of the US’s massive debt.

22
00:01:29,990 --> 00:01:35,139
Not only does the US need China to buy debt,
China needs the US to continue paying that

23
00:01:35,139 --> 00:01:36,139
debt.

24
00:01:36,139 --> 00:01:39,469
But the US also needs China in non-economic
matter too.

25
00:01:39,469 --> 00:01:44,369
In North Korea and Iran, the threat of nuclear
proliferation has only recently seen some

26
00:01:44,369 --> 00:01:45,840
measure of control.

27
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:50,719
Before the easing of sanctions in Iran, China
was the country’s largest purchaser of crude

28
00:01:50,719 --> 00:01:53,439
oil, holding significant bargaining power.

29
00:01:53,439 --> 00:01:58,350
Similarly, China is one of North Korea's few
remaining allies, making it possible to facilitate

30
00:01:58,350 --> 00:01:59,759
negotiation.

31
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:04,130
Six-party talks between North Korea and the
world powers have been repeatedly encouraged

32
00:02:04,130 --> 00:02:08,220
by China, which has tense but cooperative
relations with the Hermit Kingdom.

33
00:02:08,220 --> 00:02:12,500
Finally, although China is one of the largest
polluters in the world, they are also at the

34
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:17,770
forefront of green energy which aligns directly
with US interests.

35
00:02:17,770 --> 00:02:22,060
China’s environmental actions are seen as
a guide for other developing countries, particularly

36
00:02:22,060 --> 00:02:23,060
in Africa.

37
00:02:23,060 --> 00:02:27,860
Without China, the US would have considerable
difficulty convincing the world to go green.

38
00:02:27,860 --> 00:02:31,980
Despite complaints about each other, it is
a simple fact that growth in both countries

39
00:02:31,980 --> 00:02:33,790
is dependent on them getting along.

40
00:02:33,790 --> 00:02:38,420
The stronger they are economically and militarily,
the more control they are able to exert over

41
00:02:38,420 --> 00:02:39,730
the rest of the world.

42
00:02:39,730 --> 00:00:00,000
And in the end, this may simply be a case
of “if you can’t beat ‘em, join ‘em”.
