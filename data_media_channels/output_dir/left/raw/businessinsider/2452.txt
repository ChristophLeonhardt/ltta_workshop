1
00:00:01,170 --> 00:00:03,990
Narrator: You might think
of vanilla as basic.

2
00:00:03,990 --> 00:00:08,990
The word is even used to mean
boring, average, or basic.

3
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:11,520
Student: Why do we have to
go all vanilla on this song?

4
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:13,780
See what we need is my chocolate thunder.

5
00:00:13,780 --> 00:00:15,990
Narrator: But vanilla may not always be

6
00:00:15,990 --> 00:00:17,353
so run of the mill.

7
00:00:19,780 --> 00:00:22,090
Vanilla prices have climbed so high

8
00:00:22,090 --> 00:00:25,030
it's worth more by weight than silver,

9
00:00:25,030 --> 00:00:27,830
and that high price tag could be bad news

10
00:00:27,830 --> 00:00:31,303
for lovers of ice cream,
yogurt, chocolate,

11
00:00:31,303 --> 00:00:33,753
and even perfumes.

12
00:00:35,410 --> 00:00:38,400
One reason vanilla has
gotten so expensive is,

13
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:39,800
it's hard to grow.

14
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:43,000
Vanilla vines take two to
four years to fully mature,

15
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:47,320
and their flowers only bloom
for one day of the year.

16
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:49,606
In order for the plants to produce beans,

17
00:00:49,606 --> 00:00:52,920
they have to be pollinated that day.

18
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:55,230
In most places where vanilla is grown,

19
00:00:55,230 --> 00:00:57,070
it isn't a native plant,

20
00:00:57,070 --> 00:00:59,910
and there aren't bugs or birds capable

21
00:00:59,910 --> 00:01:01,900
of pollinating the flowers.

22
00:01:01,900 --> 00:01:04,489
Vanilla is native to Mexico,

23
00:01:04,489 --> 00:01:07,710
but deforestation there
has greatly reduced

24
00:01:07,710 --> 00:01:09,430
its natural habitat.

25
00:01:09,430 --> 00:01:13,790
In Madagascar, where over
80% of vanilla is produced,

26
00:01:13,790 --> 00:01:17,050
the flowers have to be pollinated by hand.

27
00:01:17,050 --> 00:01:20,910
The pods need several months
to cure after harvesting.

28
00:01:20,910 --> 00:01:25,070
The whole process is
time-consuming and labor-intensive.

29
00:01:25,070 --> 00:01:27,990
But the record high price of vanilla

30
00:01:27,990 --> 00:01:31,940
also has to do with changes
in the vanilla market.

31
00:01:31,940 --> 00:01:35,000
In the 1980s, cheaper artificial vanilla

32
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,636
overtook the market.

33
00:01:36,636 --> 00:01:39,470
Vanilla farmers cut back production

34
00:01:39,470 --> 00:01:41,920
because they weren't making enough money.

35
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:46,920
But around 2011, demand for
real vanilla rose again.

36
00:01:47,060 --> 00:01:50,320
Big companies were joining
the all-natural trend,

37
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:52,670
pledging to eliminate
artificial flavorings

38
00:01:52,670 --> 00:01:53,870
from their products,

39
00:01:53,870 --> 00:01:56,910
but it's taken a while
for the vanilla farmers

40
00:01:56,910 --> 00:01:58,620
to get back in the game

41
00:01:58,620 --> 00:02:00,563
and they don't all want to.

42
00:02:01,900 --> 00:02:05,570
Growing vanilla is a stressful
and volatile business

43
00:02:05,570 --> 00:02:07,850
because there is such high demand,

44
00:02:07,850 --> 00:02:10,470
vanilla beans are a target for theft.

45
00:02:10,470 --> 00:02:12,985
After working hard to
cultivate their crops

46
00:02:12,985 --> 00:02:16,113
some farmers have their beans stolen.

47
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:20,270
As the stolen beans move
up the supply chain,

48
00:02:20,270 --> 00:02:23,350
they get mixed in with
legally purchased beans

49
00:02:23,350 --> 00:02:25,870
making it difficult for buyers to know

50
00:02:25,870 --> 00:02:27,740
which are which.

51
00:02:27,740 --> 00:02:28,800
To prevent theft,

52
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:32,340
farmers pick the beans before they're ripe

53
00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:36,093
and unripe beans means
lower quality vanilla.

54
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:39,510
Farmers also try to prevent theft

55
00:02:39,510 --> 00:02:43,160
by branding their vanilla crops
with a metal pronged brand.

56
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:46,150
That way buyers can identify what farm

57
00:02:46,150 --> 00:02:48,150
the vanilla came from.

58
00:02:48,150 --> 00:02:51,550
Farmers also run the risk of
having their crops destroyed

59
00:02:51,550 --> 00:02:53,670
by extreme weather events.

60
00:02:53,670 --> 00:02:56,260
Cyclones are common in Madagascar

61
00:02:56,260 --> 00:02:59,360
and climate change is
increasing the frequency

62
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:02,090
and intensity of those storms.

63
00:03:02,090 --> 00:03:05,540
If a cyclone were to wipe
out vanilla crops next year,

64
00:03:05,540 --> 00:03:09,470
it would take until at
least 2022 for new plants

65
00:03:09,470 --> 00:03:11,320
to start producing beans,

66
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:13,800
and farmers might not
want to take that risk.

67
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:17,830
So the supply could continue
to drop even further.

68
00:03:17,830 --> 00:03:20,350
The once basic, boring vanilla

69
00:03:20,350 --> 00:00:00,000
may wind up becoming a
rare sought-after delicacy.
