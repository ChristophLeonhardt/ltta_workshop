00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,550

00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:06,660
<font color="#CCCCCC">YouTube that's youtube if you're</font>

4
00:00:06,660 --> 00:00:08,460
American this is a topic I've wanted to

5
00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:10,590
cover for so many years but it just<font color="#E5E5E5"> felt</font>

6
00:00:10,590 --> 00:00:13,049
right at this moment in time because the

7
00:00:13,049 --> 00:00:15,420
other day<font color="#CCCCCC"> I received some pretty epic</font>

8
00:00:15,420 --> 00:00:17,460
news but if you're not interested in the

9
00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:18,720
good news and<font color="#CCCCCC"> want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to skip straight to</font>

00:00:21,270 --> 00:00:23,910
youtube just<font color="#E5E5E5"> click here oh you haven't</font>

12
00:00:23,910 --> 00:00:26,130
well thanks if you work in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the broadcast</font>

13
00:00:26,130 --> 00:00:28,019
industry you probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> read this and</font>

14
00:00:28,019 --> 00:00:29,490
every year they have<font color="#CCCCCC"> something called</font>

15
00:00:29,490 --> 00:00:31,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">hotshots and this is a list of people</font>

16
00:00:31,830 --> 00:00:34,430
who are under 30 that broadcast magazine

17
00:00:34,430 --> 00:00:36,750
recommends you look out for<font color="#CCCCCC"> in the</font>

18
00:00:36,750 --> 00:00:38,730
broadcast industry and as if I could be

19
00:00:38,730 --> 00:00:40,410
any more predictable I got the

20
00:00:40,410 --> 00:00:42,540
nomination in the digital category a

21
00:00:42,540 --> 00:00:45,930
huge thanks to my bosses will and Justin

22
00:00:45,930 --> 00:00:48,390
from<font color="#E5E5E5"> channel flip for nominating me it's</font>

23
00:00:48,390 --> 00:00:51,329
a huge honor and to be in a photo like

24
00:00:51,329 --> 00:00:54,510
that was just<font color="#CCCCCC"> truly epic that's probably</font>

25
00:00:54,510 --> 00:00:55,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">been one of the biggest achievements</font>

26
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:58,859
I've had in my youtube career if we're

27
00:00:58,859 --> 00:01:00,989
to call it<font color="#CCCCCC"> that and I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know there are so</font>

28
00:01:00,989 --> 00:01:02,820
many people out there wondering how can

29
00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:05,010
I be successful so here are<font color="#CCCCCC"> my four ways</font>

30
00:01:05,010 --> 00:01:06,810
have been successful on YouTube number

31
00:01:06,810 --> 00:01:09,030
one maintaining integrity it's so

32
00:01:09,030 --> 00:01:11,220
important to not allow the mainstream to

33
00:01:11,220 --> 00:01:13,229
completely transform your identity now

34
00:01:13,229 --> 00:01:13,950
that doesn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> mean you have to be</font>

35
00:01:13,950 --> 00:01:15,780
completely stubborn or that you can't

36
00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:17,130
have learnings from your external

37
00:01:17,130 --> 00:01:18,990
environment all I'm saying is just keep

38
00:01:18,990 --> 00:01:20,369
yourself in check from time to time

39
00:01:20,369 --> 00:01:23,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">because you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> should just stay true to</font>

40
00:01:23,610 --> 00:01:25,619
<font color="#CCCCCC">yourself and no one knows you better</font>

41
00:01:25,619 --> 00:01:28,409
then yourself number two touching the

42
00:01:28,409 --> 00:01:30,060
lives of others<font color="#CCCCCC"> I think you can regard</font>

43
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:32,579
it a success if the actions you take in

44
00:01:32,579 --> 00:01:34,619
life have a positive effect on other

45
00:01:34,619 --> 00:01:36,450
people whether you're a comedian making

46
00:01:36,450 --> 00:01:38,310
other people laugh a teacher who is able

47
00:01:38,310 --> 00:01:40,079
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> educate others or if you're so on</font>

48
00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:42,060
<font color="#CCCCCC">who's just reaching</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> out so someone else</font>

49
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:44,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> world no longer feels alone you</font>

50
00:01:44,130 --> 00:01:46,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">are helping unite the world number three</font>

51
00:01:46,290 --> 00:01:48,899
feeling alive this is about not allowing

52
00:01:48,899 --> 00:01:51,149
a moment to go wasted seizing those

53
00:01:51,149 --> 00:01:52,740
opportunities that are handed to you

54
00:01:52,740 --> 00:01:54,899
whenever you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can and of course enjoying</font>

55
00:01:54,899 --> 00:01:56,909
life as much<font color="#E5E5E5"> as possible now I could be</font>

56
00:01:56,909 --> 00:01:58,590
wrong here but I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> think there are</font>

57
00:01:58,590 --> 00:02:00,450
many instances where someone has

58
00:02:00,450 --> 00:02:02,549
succeeded with something they haven't

59
00:02:02,549 --> 00:02:04,979
truly enjoyed at one moment number<font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font>

60
00:02:04,979 --> 00:02:07,140
creating legacy as you probably already

61
00:02:07,140 --> 00:02:09,538
know legacy to me is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the meaning of life</font>

62
00:02:09,538 --> 00:02:11,700
and I suppose this is quite an easy one

63
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:13,060
on youtube because

64
00:02:13,060 --> 00:02:16,120
any video you upload will probably last

65
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:18,400
longer than you do unless you are doing

66
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:23,500
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> but really legacy surely</font>

67
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:25,120
that's real success now there is one

68
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:27,130
measure of<font color="#E5E5E5"> success I haven't yet</font>

69
00:02:27,130 --> 00:02:29,349
mentioned which so many people around

70
00:02:29,349 --> 00:02:32,410
<font color="#CCCCCC">the internet and in life use well for me</font>

71
00:02:32,410 --> 00:02:34,900
it's because<font color="#CCCCCC"> views are an extension of</font>

72
00:02:34,900 --> 00:02:37,690
those<font color="#E5E5E5"> four things views on their own</font>

73
00:02:37,690 --> 00:02:40,180
what do<font color="#E5E5E5"> they actually mean because</font>

74
00:02:40,180 --> 00:02:41,800
whether you're someone who is<font color="#CCCCCC"> making a</font>

75
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:43,569
video they guess a hundred views or

76
00:02:43,569 --> 00:02:45,850
making a video that gets a million views

77
00:02:45,850 --> 00:02:48,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">you're still physically doing the same</font>

78
00:02:48,580 --> 00:02:50,470
thing so let's take the<font color="#E5E5E5"> four things</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

79
00:02:50,470 --> 00:02:52,180
mentioned already maintaining integrity

80
00:02:52,180 --> 00:02:55,000
if you manage<font color="#CCCCCC"> to get millions and</font>

81
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,310
millions of views on your videos but<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

82
00:02:57,310 --> 00:02:59,709
<font color="#E5E5E5">haven't stayed true to yourself I can</font>

83
00:02:59,709 --> 00:03:02,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">guarantee you won't feel the achievement</font>

84
00:03:02,530 --> 00:03:04,569
and success that someone would<font color="#E5E5E5"> have done</font>

85
00:03:04,569 --> 00:03:06,819
if they had stayed true to themselves

86
00:03:06,819 --> 00:03:09,160
touching the lives of others<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you are</font>

87
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:10,810
doing videos that reach out to people

88
00:03:10,810 --> 00:03:13,299
then views do make a difference if I

89
00:03:13,299 --> 00:03:16,200
could inspire just<font color="#E5E5E5"> 10 people or</font>

90
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:19,150
thousands of people of course I'd like

91
00:03:19,150 --> 00:03:20,290
to be in a position where I could

92
00:03:20,290 --> 00:03:22,959
inspire more feeling alive this ties in

93
00:03:22,959 --> 00:03:25,390
with number one if you are trying to<font color="#CCCCCC"> get</font>

94
00:03:25,390 --> 00:03:27,430
views just make<font color="#CCCCCC"> sure you're enjoying</font>

95
00:03:27,430 --> 00:03:30,519
yourself because<font color="#E5E5E5"> it will feel so so much</font>

96
00:03:30,519 --> 00:03:32,410
more worthwhile I promise you that and

97
00:03:32,410 --> 00:03:34,810
creating legacy this ties in with the

98
00:03:34,810 --> 00:03:37,060
other three because it's so good<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

99
00:03:37,060 --> 00:03:39,670
create content and to have an<font color="#CCCCCC"> impact on</font>

100
00:03:39,670 --> 00:03:42,549
the world that outlives yourself and you

101
00:03:42,549 --> 00:03:43,930
want to reach as many people as you can

102
00:03:43,930 --> 00:03:47,769
so while you are alive try and get the

103
00:03:47,769 --> 00:03:50,260
ball rolling get as much momentum as you

104
00:03:50,260 --> 00:03:52,090
can that's what it's about so there<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

105
00:03:52,090 --> 00:03:53,889
have it my thoughts on how to be

106
00:03:53,889 --> 00:03:57,370
successful on YouTube and in life so

107
00:03:57,370 --> 00:03:59,139
good<font color="#CCCCCC"> luck with all your future efforts</font>

108
00:03:59,139 --> 00:04:02,500
