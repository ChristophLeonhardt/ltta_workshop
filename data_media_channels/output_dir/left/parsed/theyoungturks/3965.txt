A FEDERAL JUDGE HAS RULED IN
FAVOR OF A PRELIMINARY
INJUNCTION AGAINST TEXAS'S
TOUGH SANCTUARY CITIES LAW.
SENATE BILL FOR WHICH IS THE
LAW IN QUESTION ESSENTIALLY
FORCES POLICE OFFICIALS TO ASK
INDIVIDUALS THAT THEY SUSPECTED
OF BEING UNDOCUMENTED IMMIGRANTS
FOR THEIR PAPERWORK TO PROVE
THAT THEY ARE IN THE COUNTRY
LEGALLY AND IT HAS A NUMBER OF
OTHER ELEMENTS THAT THIS FEDERAL
JUDGE DEEMED UNCONSTITUTIONAL.
IT DOESN'T MEAN HE HAS
COMPLETELY BLOCKED IT, IT JUST
MEANS
THAT THERE WILL BE A STAY OR
PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION AND
TELL THIS CASE BEARS OUT IN
COURT.
SO I WANT TO 
STOP THERE FOR A
2ND.
WHEN WE TALK ABOUT SANCTUARY
CITIES, THE WAY THAT IT IS
OFTEN DISCUSSED IN THE MEDIA IS
MISLEADING.
IT MAKES IT SEEM AS THOUGH IN
SANCTUARY CITIES, LOCAL
COPS REFUSE TO WORK WITH ICE
OFFICIALS OR FEDERAL AGENTS
BUT THAT IS ACTUALLY NOT THE
CASE.
WHAT ICE AGENTS ASK FOR IS A
CERTAIN MUNICIPALITIES TO
DETAIN PEOPLE FOR AN INDEFINITE
OF TIME UNTIL THEY CAN
PROVE THAT THE INDIVIDUAL IS IN
THE COUNTRY ILLEGALLY.
THAT TAKES A CONSIDERABLE AMOUNT
OF RESOURCES.
OUR PRISON SYSTEM AND OUR JAILS
ARE OBVIOUSLY OVERFULL AND
SO CERTAIN CITIES HAVE SUIT
AGAINST THAT BECAUSE THEY
ARE LIKE WE CAN'T JUST DETAIN
PEOPLE INDEFINITELY.
THIS IS A MAKE SENSE.
THERE ACTUALLY SEVERAL
DIFFERENT COMPONENTS.
CENTURY CITY IS NOT A REAL
DESIGNATION SO THERE IS NOT
A DESIGNATION FOR AND THE
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT.
SOME OF THE THINGS THAT THEY DO
I TOTALLY AGREE WITH IN
TERMS OF SIX WERE A CITIES.
SOME I AM LESS SURE ABOUT.
FOR EXAMPLE, THEY SAY WE'RE NOT
GOING TO PULL PEOPLE OVER
LIKE SHERIFF JOE ARPAIO DID IN
TEXAS AND ASK FOR THE PAPERS.
IT'S ON OUR JURISDICTION TYPE
THEY ARE IN THE COUNTRY AND
COUNTRY LEGALLY THAT IS A
FEDERAL CASE NOT A STATE OR
LOCAL.
2ND OF ALL, WE CAMP WILL PEOPLE
OVER AND LET ME HAVE SOME
SORT OF PROBABLE CAUSE AND YOU
LOOK LATINO IS NOT PROBABLE
CAUSE SO THAT IS WHAT YOU CALL
A CENTURY CITY WERE THEY
DIRECT THEIR COPS NOT TO BE
RACIST, GREAT.
I LOVE IT I'M TOTALLY IN FAVOR
OF IT.
THERE ARE OTHER PARTS OF WHAT
THEY CALL CENTURY CITY WERE
SOMETIMES ICE WILL SAY YOU
ARRESTED THAT GUY ON A
DIFFERENT CHARGE BUT WE HAVE
REASON TO BELIEVE HE IS IN
THE COUNTRY ILLEGALLY.
HOLD HIM.
THAT IS RIGHT IS TO BE A TOUGHER
ISSUE.
PROBABLY WAY AND WAS REFERRING
TO THEIR BECAUSE LOOK, THAT IS
YOUR JURISDICTION NOT MINE AND I
DON'T WANT MY TAXPAYERS PAYING
FOR IT AND PLUS, ONE OF THE
THINGS THAT HAPPENS IS IF YOU
TURN THE LOCAL COPS AND ICE
OFFICIALS THEN THE PEOPLE IN THE
AREA ARE MORE RELUCTANT TO TALK
TO THE COPS AND REPORT CRIMES.
IT'S ACTUALLY THE COPS IN THOSE
CITIES WHO SAY NO, WE DON'T WANT
TO HOLD, SERVE AS A HOLDING PEN
FOR ICE BECAUSE THAT IS
COUNTERPRODUCTIVE TO OUR
INTERESTS AS LOCAL POLICE
OFFICERS.
TO BE HONEST WITH YOU IT IS
COUNTERPRODUCTIVE FROM US
EVERYONE'S INTEREST WITH THE
EXCEPTION OF PEOPLE WHO
HAVE ABSOLUTELY NO COMPASSION
FOR ANYONE.
WHAT I MEAN BY THAT IS THEY HAVE
REASON TO BELIEVE THAT THAT
INDIVIDUAL MIGHT BE IN THE
COUNTRY ILLEGALLY, RIGHT?
THEY ASKED ME CITIES IN THESE
COPS TO DETAIN THESE PEOPLE
INDEFINITELY UNTIL THEY GET
AROUND TO INVESTIGATING THE
SITUATION.
IT TAKES A LONG TIME TO
INVESTIGATE THE SITUATION
OR GET TO THAT PARTICULAR CASE
AND WHAT IF THAT PERSON IS IN
THE COUNTRY LEGALLY AND IN A LOT
OF CASES, THAT IS WHAT HAPPENS.
AT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT DID
THIS RIGHT THEN WE WOULD
HAVE A LOT LESS OF AN ISSUE.
MY PROPOSAL WOULD BE, LISTEN, IF
YOU THINK SOMEONE IS IN THE
COUNTRY ILLEGALLY AND THEIR
SENTENCES UP AT A LOCAL
LEVEL, GO GET THEM.
PUT THEM IN A FEDERAL HOLDING
FACILITY AND BY THE WAY,
GIVE THEM DUE PROCESS WHICH
INCLUDES A SPEEDY TRIAL.
IF YOU THINK THAT THEY HAVE
BROKEN THE LAW OR THEY ARE
HERE ILLEGALLY, THEN HURRY UP
AND HANDLE THAT IN A
CONSTITUTIONAL WAY.
IF YOU SAY I WOULD JUST LIKE TO
BE ABLE TO HOLD SOMEBODY
WHETHER THEY WERE POSITIVE OR
NOT THAT THEY ARE LIVING IN
THE COUNTRY ILLEGALLY AND I
WOULD LIKE A LONG TIME AND
I DON'T WANT TO PAY FOR IT, YOU
PAY FOR IT.
THAT MAKES NO SENSE AT ALL.
NOW IN TEXAS PASSES A LAW SAYING
THE CITIES ARE NOT ALLOWED TO DO
ANY OF THIS.
THEY MUST FOLLOW THE ORDERS OF
THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT EVEN
THOUGH THAT IS NOT THEIR
JURISDICTION AND IF THEY
DON'T, WE ARE GOING TO PUT THOSE
COPS IN PRISON.
WAY, I THOUGHT YOU GUYS WERE FOR
COPS.
IT'S AMAZING.
THE COPS COULD POTENTIALLY FACE
CRIMINAL CHARGES OF THEY REFUSE
TO COMPLY UNDER THIS LAW AND
THEN THE OTHER PART OF IT IS
EVEN IF IT'S AN ELECTED OFFICIAL
WHO REFUSES TO COMPLY WITH WHAT
FEDERAL OFFICIALS WANT, THAT
ELECTED OFFICIAL COULD BE TAKEN
OUT OF OFFICE BASED ON THE
WORDING OF THIS LAW AND SO THE
FEDERAL JUDGE IN THIS CASE WHO
DECIDED TO ISSUE THIS
PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION WAS LIKE
YEAH, THERE'S A LOT OF
UNCONSTITUTIONAL COMPONENTS HERE
AND AS A RESULT, I AM GOING TO
GO AHEAD AND PAUSE UNTIL THIS
CASE BEARS OUT IN COURT.
KEEP IN MIND THERE WERE SEVERAL
CITIES WITHIN TEXAS THAT
SUIT AGAINST THE SENATE BILL.
THAT INCLUDED HOUSTON, AUSTIN,
SAN ANTONIO, AND DALLAS.
MANNY FERNANDEZ FOR THE NEW YORK
TIMES WRITES:
THERE IS A FIRST AMENDMENT ISSUE
HERE AS WELL BECAUSE THE FEDERAL
GOVERNMENT IS OBVIOUSLY
ATTEMPTING TO TAKE ACTION
AGAINST LOCAL GOVERNMENT OVER A
DIFFERENCE IN POLITICAL OPINION.
I KNOW THAT THE RIGHT WING IS
GOING TO SUPPORT THE JUDGE
BECAUSE THEY COULD HEAR CARE
DEEPLY ABOUT FREEDOM OF SPEECH
SO WHEN ONE OF THEIR OWN WANTS
TO GET PAID A LOT OF MONEY TO
SPEAK ON A COLLEGE CAMPUS, THAT
IS A FREEDOM OF SPEECH ISSUE.
WHEN NAZIS MARK MARCH IN
CHARLOTTESVILLE THAT IS A
FREEDOM OF SPEECH ISSUE.
WHEN LOCAL COUNSEL AND HAVE
THEIR FREEDOM OF SPEECH,
NO, WE ARE AGAINST COPS AND WE
WANT THEM SPEAK.
THAT IS A CONSERVATIVE POSITION
IN TEXAS AND A FEDERAL
JUDGE HAS SAID NO, THAT IS
UNCONSTITUTIONAL.
EXACTLY.
IN FACT I WANT TO
READ YOU HIS QUOTE BECAUSE I
THINK
IT IS IMPORTANT AND IT GIVES
YOU A SENSE OF WHERE HE IS
COMING FROM.
JUDGE GARCIA WRITES:
DAMN.
I'M SURE THE RIGHT WING WILL
TURN AROUND NOW AND SAVE
BLUE LIVES MATTER, BLUE SPEECH
MATTERS AND LET'S PROTECT
THE LOCAL COPS AGAINST THIS
OVERREACH BY THE STATE
GOVERNMENT.
WE WILL SEE ABOUT THAT.
LOOKING FORWARD TO YOUR
AGREEMENT ON THIS ISSUE.
