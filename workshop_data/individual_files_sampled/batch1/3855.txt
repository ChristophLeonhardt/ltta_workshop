sexuality is a place you go it's a space you enter inside yourself with another it's an invitation and so what is that erotic space where we can travel II spend time that is the work on desire it's not about tricks it's much more on so in some way of an existential experience why not people most drawn to each other the biggest turn-on confidence not the size of your breasts and not many other body parts confidence because you can wear the same tight pants but if you wear them without confidence it doesn't do the trick confidence is radiant when I am looking at this person that is separate from me and that I admire actually that is other that I don't ever really know what they're experiencing while they're in their element because it's their element very often it is also about learning to move and to express my experience one's body so I love anything that has to do with dancing and movement I think tango is an absolute choreography of desire one of the main things that goes away many couples is the whole seduction which is often called romance for in the language of women but it is that play fullness by which I come towards you but I don't assault you with my wanting I suggest it to you and then I let you wait and then I build it and then you begin to want and then I don't give it back to you immediately this whole tension building that understands the relationship between excitement and frustration
