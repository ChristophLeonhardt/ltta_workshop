welcome to the very first episode of the Stan Collymore show delighted to be here as we start the countdown to the World Cup in Russia next year I cannot wait in the coming weeks we'll be showing you some quite incredible footage from around the world as well as taking you around beautiful Russia as it prepares to host the biggest football event the biggest sporting event the biggest event on the planet one small but very proud nation has sealed their very first qualification for the World Cup finals in Russia next year with a population of 300,000 that's 100 times smaller than Brazil good stat for you there some of you may remember them as the shocked team of last year's European Championships but others may remember them for this so how did this tiny nation climb to the summit of world football what's the secret of their success I went to see for myself the Icelandic government about 10-15 years ago decided that rather than kids playing football on bogey pitches once or twice a week they wanted to fit healthy nation and everybody have the ability to play the beautiful game of football so these amazing indoor astroturf pitches were basically rolled out right across the country I'm joined by Hawkins fellows to lose one of the coaches here is quite incredible facility at bright oblique garrovick another play this give us a little bit of background as to how iceland developed these kind of facilities we have been building a six seven houses around Iceland - over the last 10-15 years and it's the state in its state the bill to the house so the club is not built in the house so the community is paying for it and so every kid can play football so the rule in Iceland is that every kit and ice we can play football it doesn't matter how good you are 50 20 years ago we only could play football once a week inter football but with these facilities as well as some artificial grass outside and small artificial five against five artificial grass pizzas we can play a lot of football so every kid in Iceland can play football five six seven times a week we have in this club I think we have almost the biggest club in Europe we have 1500 kids and in it's a stupid have 60 60 70 kids just all of them can play inside but the kids from the age of 15 we only can train inside to three times a week we also need to train outside in remote parts of Iceland are the five aside pitches are strokes attitude we've got five outside pitches around every school in Iceland it was spent 15 years ago I think every school in almost every school yeah in every small religious in Iceland with 200 people living there or 2,000 it doesn't matter you only have one or three pizzas in its place so every kid in Iceland it doesn't matter where you live you can play football all year long what kind of boost have you already seen two Icelandic football from the current team great post because because the parents they can see what can be done and the kids can see what can be done so they they can improve themselves you don't meet any code to tell the kids to train extra hard the kids can see what it means to train extra hard didn't see that yeah the big stars so we might well be seeing the next kill facility yeah probably he was brought up here really this is his club this club for three or four years investment in pitches astroturf pitches ouchies pitches at schools yeah it's now bearing fruit yeah not just about professional footballers but people that are enjoying their sport here artificial turf is what we are introducing now and it's been happening over a long long period it is an investment but the municipalities and the clubs have come together and realize that it just makes sense it's it creates better living standards and what the claps are doing for the kids straight out of school they go to go to clubs and they can use the facilities and what is happening in the social life is also reflected by the participation in different sports overtime there has been more and more cooperation between the municipalities this state the Football Association and the clubs to build those facilities and I believe you will not find anywhere in the world the same density of indoor football pitches and outdoor artificial grass as you we'll find in Iceland the national team's report has pulled Benjamin yes you getting sweaty you're ready for the game yeah taller on my trip my phone book have we started Josie no fun that's what she means 12th man of course yeah so you are the 12th man yeah you've been here since the very beginning yeah yeah a small population and you cannot stand in the crowd in the stadium unless you can yeah you can reach something someone that know something on the field he sees the day when Iceland 300,000 people can go to the biggest tournaments of them all exactly to my mind it's like a fairy tale that is never gonna happen but we basically just meet up here we sing we have a great time drink a little beer then in about an hour the national coach actually comes by couch of an international football team comes before a game when he's in the zone is contra to chat with the fans and give them the team absolutely gives us the team shows us the motivational video that he shows to the players and basically two hours before every match he's here getting us ready for the match incredible things with him and he kind of shows the team spirit it's not just the players it's not just the fans it's a whole collaborative effort absolutely the whole nation combined into one you know so we're going in the managers just gone in phones off my father switched off so portability new information we're going to get the team and nobody tweets Facebook's instagrams a word trust between manager and fan is quite credible last year but I suppose competing against England experienced the greatest what happened tonight you know I saw video and films about the streets that everybody was watching the game it was like it was like a island with no but ninety minutes later everybody was out partying for ten hours and nobody showed for the day after I think it's it's an absolutely foul Nigerian wreck you bit but spirits are very high and again the hope is that Iceland for the first time ever gets the World Cup finals in Russia next year - Oh world's smallest mention other to close fun for the FIFA World Cup finals English the World Cup in Russia the whole line that divides it was always a dream gained in the a big tournament we made it to the the euros made it to the World Cup now sighs it's incredible to be from a small nation like this one actually it's party time the red giveth I cannot wait to see these ones in Russia in Sochi in Kazan in Moscow and so Petersburg in Iceland for now though it's party time 1618 hours after the miracle Iceland 300,000 people qualifying for the World Cup how do you feel today hangover no but yeah yeah you know it's it's a kind of silly question of course you feel really well when you've accomplished things like that your dreams come true success is not a destination success for Iceland was not going to the Euro final success is a continuous journey to the right direction we are now getting better and better footballers because of the coaching and the facilities a fantastic achievement I think you know the qualify for the World Cup we had great Euro last year in France but but now to qualify for for the World Cup for the first time is just exceptional and everyone is enjoying it not just the players and then all the stuff around the team but as a whole as a nation we're enjoying this moment and I stood in a sports bar several hundreds Iceland fans and the national team coach comes in he says you trust me I trust you so he founds off don't give this information to people and I will give you the team news before the media gets it why it's unique you can have 500 people drinking beer to shut up that's the first secondly that in the world today nobody is taping for 6 years nothing has leaked out what an incredible the trust between you and them is like that and that's that's that's mutual there's so much mutual nuts that's what kind of I like people have said now you have to stop it but I think when you have something that nobody else has that's also I could feel it and to be able to to to do that you know it's also kind of that they like us and be like them and when the going gets tough they stick together with us because they have an ownership in the team in the boys they have such a massive ownership in what we are doing I think it well within our reach to obviously first want to get out of the group qualify for the last sixteen and then you know who knows but we will certainly be aiming high and and these guys at the so ambitious so together in their quest for success so I've got full faith in the team and and the coaches or where I can see as a surprise again and and and do really well again I pray it will be way too late the teammates in the first game could be some Petersburg Krasnodar Sochi how will that make you feel I don't know we'll have to see probably a little bit nervous to be honest but of course mercifully proud you know as a coach when you have that kind of players and that work for each other when you have our staff I have and when you have the supporters when you have all those factors working with you you know it's you can't have a better job around please don't be in the same group as England this time and please please if you are in the same group as England we need a little bit of this magic dust as well so be careful from the celebration of one nation to the anguish of another after the break we'll take a look at the closest thing to a football miracle yet don't go anywhere
