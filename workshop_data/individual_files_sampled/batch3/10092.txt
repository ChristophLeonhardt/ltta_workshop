hello and welcome to crosstalk where all things are considered I'm Peter Lavelle grim memories ten years ago the start of the Great Recession began a political reassessment and fueled on a sense of anger and resentment across the Western world then Donald Trump entered the picture this in much more uncrossed crosstalking the great transformation I'm joined by my guests here in Moscow mark sloboda he's an international affairs and security analyst we also have Dimitri Babak he's a political analyst with Sputnik International and we have Glenn DS and he is a professor at the higher School of Economics all right gentleman crosstalk rolls in effect that means he can jump in anytime you want and I always appreciate it Glenn let me go to you first here this is the tenth anniversary of the beginning of the Great Recession and what's really interesting about the last ten years that if you were wealthy in the 1% you could say recession what recession you have a greater concentration of banks greater concentration of media and you have tens of millions of people across the Western world but that is the defining moment in their life it will probably be for the rest of their lives but if it depends on what side of the divide you on because you know if these palm elites were just too big to jail well that's correct and they only become much bigger since then and and they're also much more exposed now to to debt and a volatility in the market so I think yeah this crisis is far from over and I think the next crisis that comes along it will be much worse because let's not forget this crisis was caused a great extent by too much borrowing and too much spending and essentially yeah too much debt and to get out of it the essentialists borrowed more in order to spend more and you know in quantitative easing inflate this as about balls so I think that once they take away this yes this kool-aid let's call it then the things will go quite bad and at this point it will be much worse than the previous time I think what the political ramifications are immense mark okay and when you can draw this as a fundamental moment phenomena that actually created the demand for somebody like Donald Trump and rate of right-wing populism in Europe I mean austerity is a hard thing to sell yeah first of all the the fault and and the lack of response by Washington by other countries is universal it's on both sides of the political aisle I mean it is is the the big Wall Street bankers no big Wall Street banker responsible Lehman Brothers anyone else has never been held accountable they picked off a few smaller bank and in the u.s. under tarp just to say that a few people were punished but certainly none of the ones that were really responsible for it and you know this didn't only happen in the US and it happened all around and they continued on with complete impunity and none of the rule broken rules of the game that allowed them to do all of this to inflate these bubbles have been changed and they're simply talking now what will be the next big bubble bubblee be mortgages again I would be education I was always a finance at one point he may know there was plenty of private financing that could have bailed out Lehman Brothers and everyone else there's so much money on Wall Street but no what we get now and this is the perception I think widely across the Western world is that you have socialism state socialism for the rich and then you have capitalism for the rest of us again you know planned economy they all be viable and economy every economies planned it just depends on who is planning it unfortunately Wall Street was planning basically planning or the US economy and it ran it into a disaster no question that because of the number of Wall Street officials in both the Obama administration go right into running the economic fractions I got away Obama put that you know Obama said let me put this week it didn't start with Donald Trump he is a symptom not the course he has been capitalizing on resentments that politicians have been failing for years now who was the predecessor of Donald Trump who has been feigning all of this Obama for two consecutive terms was had in the country I like the way Jimmy door put it in his show he said it was not Donald Trump who made the US defense budget seven hundred billion dollars it was not Donald Trump who started the war in Libya who helped the wars in Ukraine and in Syria it was Obama and now Obama is saying that Trump is you know I think it's is hitting an interesting point here I mean this is an article in the American consumer venom and I encourage our viewers to look at the American consider some great stuff there all the time yeah all the time the coup against Trump and we could talk about that there but the conclusion this is only think it's kind of interesting and it kind of goes back to what Mark was saying quote for his supporters Trump's continued occupancy of the White House is more about cultural grievance a middle finger to we failed establishment then a knock-down drag-out fight over real political change Glenn and I think part of this efforts or the course they refer to especially abandoned referred to as of course well I think the effort to bring down Trump over yeah allegations which essential hasn't been proven it it's not gonna go down well with his voters because as you mentioned a lot of this he largely came to power because of the way the leads responded to this financial crisis and again a smartphone that no one was there was no investigation was no Mueller a investigation no one was held accountable despite obvious a lot of crimes were committed so not all of this was fine but now we see yeah ten years later the essential guy who came to power the only one in the lead who was openly bringing this forward yeah he's now gonna be a huge irony mark is that nothing has been proven against Trump I mean you could like him or dislike you know it about his personality it's indifferent to me but we had a absolute catastrophic crisis in the economy no one is held accountable Trump hasn't done anything wrong anything wrong and they're persecuting him and prosecuting him in the media well I mean that's just he is now at the 10-year anniversary of this simply a convenient scapegoat for all of this but you know he is a member of the 1% right he is not a part of the establishment he's a hanger-on we all remember the pictures of Clinton's at Trump's wedding you know but he's never been accepted as a part of the establishment this was not only a failure of the financial system and everything but it was also one of the biggest wealth transfers in recent history certainly in the last two decades because the 1% have benefited from all of the growth that has occurred since 2008 it has all been dumped into their pockets that not only have they not suffered they've benefited it says this is a neoliberalism on steroids and it continues meanwhile 93 million Americans homes were foreclosed on and this has fueled the populist sentiment maybe a lot of people don't identify it specifically with the 2008 crisis simply because of the failure of the mainstream media to point this out in stark terms but they recognize it as a continuation of globalization this is the people who suffered from globalization the people who suffered from the 2008 financial crisis in key Rust Belt states you know and Pennsylvanian in the mid-atlantic and they voted for Trump I think even because they thought he could solve their problem that it was it was Grievous sin and resentment he at least addressed them everyone else the Democratic the Republican elites denied that anyone has even suffered well the interesting thing too is if you look at Trump's tax cut you know and of course the the Republicans and the Fox are always on parroting this here but a lot of the PERT 1% use those tax cuts to buy their stock back so I mean the real growth here is interesting here but deem it for me what's really and I don't care about the rich I really don't but I care about the middle class because the middle class has certain cultural and moral values that I think are worth preserving and protecting they are the ones that got the brunt of it well dr. Carlson again on folk skills put it very well she said that when I was young the middle class was beginning now I see it shrinking and and the blame game you know something that mark has just mentioned it's just you know absurd the Washington Post accused Trump for Florence hurricane in what way because Donald Trump's holds wrong views on climate change so that indeed I think many will be blamed for one capitalism is being blamed but in this instant this wasn't really capitalism because in capitalism those who do things wrong essentially they they punish and those who did things right they essentially take over what you saw in this instant was essentially people throwing good money after bad money because the common corporations did everything wrong this is my thing with that I mean I would say this is more cronyism in corporate capitalism because you're absolutely right in theory in a pure sense if you make a bad decision she should pay for it okay but in this case a cascade number of a level of mistakes were made and they were only protected and bailed out recession in what recession ten years later that's how the one-percent feel yeah and we often describe this as neoliberalism well technically that's not true it's what we've judged the call on this runaway vulture capitalism but it actually combines the worst aspects of Hayekian neoliberalism with the worst aspects of Keynesianism with with bailing out of the banks and the government you know shifting the cost of this from the the big financial institutions which gambled and lost the money to to the private citizen so it so what it is is that you can bail out Wall Street but you don't have to worry about Main Street and that's again going back to the middle thirty seconds before the break you know too big to jail or too big to be jailed you know there are some people and there are some companies that just don't get punished and not only with the recession of 2008-2009 also with the Iraqi war no one was jailed no one was even made me that because that is bipartisan crisis what crisis and the endless foreign wars here you might care about class war but class war cares about you all right oh no gentlemen we're gonna go to a short break and after that short break we'll get any more discussion on some real news stay with our theme welcome back to crosstalk where all things are considered on Peter LaValle to remind you were discussing some real news okay before we go into some other news mark give us about a two minute update what's going on with Syria yeah it's a mess but that hasn't that's not new that's nothing new so Russia and Syria are preparing still preparing for their offensive and ed lib but they have at least temporarily put it off and the big reason for this is after the failure of the Astana summit in Tehran is Turkey Aragon has sent huge numbers of convoys into it Lib carrying arms for his proxies of course HTS controls all the checkpoints which is Al Qaeda Hayate Harrell sharm so he's essentially I mean literally arming al Qaeda he's sending tanks apcs by some reports air defense what is Turkey's defense of this because when you say he's air the one is protecting terrorists giving them supplies etc etc he wouldn't say it that way what is his justification his justification is he's protecting civilians I mean that's it he says he protecting you protecting the new Ottoman Empire that is what is really doing is a land grab it's a neo Ottoman land grab but both from the west and from Turkey which are starting to get back on the same page again the rhetoric is if Russia and the Syrian army go in the end Lib to liberate it from al Qaeda and Friends then some civilians will be killed completely not the case of course in Raqqa of Marcille or Fallujah where the u.s. devastated entire cities to get rid of Isis out there even though UN Security Council resolutions put al Qaeda and Isis on the exact same page and demand that they must both wait and we'll talk a little bit of an international law in a little bit here demon let's switch gears here a little bit immediately yeah anti-war DICOM at a fascinating article very short though EU nations consider Clearing House to avoid and ran sanctions now the reason why I put this out is that American allies are more and more concerned about being sanctioned by the US for its you can making commercial activities around the world it is is this a starting here because we cease sanctions being applied on everybody and and across many many sectors for many many different reasons it seems like this is the ultimate weapon sanctions well I'm afraid it's too late they have been going along with the United States for too long you know they were in the same boat in Libya they were in the same boat in Syria now suddenly they started to protest Trump's stance on Iran guys it's too late you know what this suggestion is Val European company could pay the clearinghouse for imported Iranian oil and the Clearing House would give that money to another company from the European Union which provides goods and services for Europe well the whole problem is that the sanctions which mr. Trump is is envisioning that against everyone they can be not only against the foreign government they can be against a foreign company and individual and and you know they have been going on for too long it's like it's like any criminal gang you know when you move the three people together when you don't want to know that the fourth one it's too late you you know the guy's going to give you up to the police you know but what's interesting for me : is it this is the breaches here and it is widening because if the European countries want to get around Trump sanctions there's other things that the the European countries ever say hey well maybe we could use this mechanism or created a new Swift system because other countries done it are the chinese other people are doing it it seems to me that this is this breach is widening and it's a it's it's a dangerous precedent from really from washington's perspective you're actually using the dollar as a weapon and it is a weapon that is becoming more and more blunt it's not the only currency in the world no I agree and I think that this reliance on the US economic and financial system has been a source of great power for the US and all throughout this hour but the problem of course if you overuse it I mean this article live Foreign Affairs that recognized you know is this too much sanctions because once you use this much sanctions countries have a huge incentive to escape it so of course it began with Russia obviously having a pretty good reasons the Chinese already began to duplicate financial system to run parallel with the United States and again the Europeans we always thought you know the Americans Trump came in now we realize that oh maybe you know we have to go as well and if the Europeans are walking that direction I don't think they will go as far as the Chinese and Russians but obviously there's a big market for an alternative system everyone from Iran to all across the globe I mean Europe you know the European Union is a largest economic entity in the world okay I mean it should start looking after itself here not in terms of in terms of defense in terms of security in terms of Finance okay sorry I was just gonna say there is a division in Europe though not everyone is on board like medical pushed back a little bit because x is Merkel been on the winning side lately yes some are some are arguing the need to have strategic patience just wait out trump for the next guy then everything will go back to normal the other side is essentially saying you know this is a trendy start it's a strange strategy you stick your head in the ground you know that storm will pass me there's a problem with EU of course is there not really one entity they are divided they don't agree on anything if the EU was serious about fighting back against the US they would put sanctions on any US financial companies that abided by the sanctions that the u.s. is putting is threatening to put on EU countries let's remember the Trump administration is now threatening the EU energy security in two ways both with trade with Iran which of course is principally oil and threatening them over the gas the Nord Stream pipeline with gas Russia's Gazprom which they need to get gas and as all this is going on the Trump announces new sanctions against China sanctions against Iran sanctions against Russia sanctions against Canada Mexico everyone else I'm starting to rethink my own personal finances in light of this and I'm investing heavily in stock in popcorn because okay why because as all this is going on in the US is weakening its number-one mechanism other than the military for global hegemony I'm enjoying watching them destroy their biggest units of power before the program I mean I said demand tickle in here I mean you know it's not Trump's America first policy because it's turning into only America policy which a I you know you can you know the u.s. is an enormous leap our Foligno one denies that it's still the center of the financial system of the world everyone knows that and can't deny it but it seems to me that the way the dollar is being used only looking at very what I would say narrow shorts yeah I should well cave that that's Mark's word narrow short-sighted national interest that is alienating the u.s. from friends and obviously phones well the problem with the you is that it's polish is not consequential they are against sanctions against Iran why were they for the war in Syria were they for the war in Libya Syria and Libya were peaceful countries they didn't attack anyone they were not a threat to Europe but they went along with Obama and then they said no we're not going to go along with Trump against Iran too late guys and I can quote their favorite Obama to them Donald Trump is not a symptom donald trump donald trump is a symptom he is not the cause they went along with that ideology for a few decades now and now they want to get off the train to wait i would add though that this you earlier mentioned is possible coup against Trump and that's exactly where what if you go think yeah I was gonna say that I've heard several American officials make the point that you know they're sending also signals out to the Europeans that you know hold on guys you know he won't be here forever like he's the president but you know the relationship will continue to that's kind of a way to reassure the Europeans so that later the administration of speaking in one voice but you know I find that to be a very hazardous policy let's wait a few a couple of years I mean they know there's a lot of here and now issues that are going on here you know market seemed it seems that you know you know with the this new book fear that has come out yeah yeah right exactly Bob Woodward's but it seems to be they're pushing the 25th amendment a strategy now because after two years I'm glad we don't talk about us so much in this program because I find it's very boring Russia Russia Russia gate is this the last thing they get to do before the midterms you know because man afford Papadopoulos Flynn had nothing to do with Russia and I've said repeatedly for two years if there were some come to some kind of collusion it would have been leaked by now by Peter struck and Lisa page yeah well I mean the argument the Trump is crazy I mean I think most of it's not an impeachable offense I think most of his voters knew he was crazy when they were he elected him and that's part of the reason why they voted for him but I I don't see there's gonna be any immediate coup against Trump because it's already been proven in fear and in this deep stater steady state or anonymous editorial the New York Times that that Trump is powerless I mean Trump said we're gonna pull all of our troops out of Syria it was a stupid thing we're supporting terrorists and Obama never should have got involved and and suddenly were doubling down we're Network have an indefinite military presence in Syria were openly doing military drills in the last week with rebels and why why do you why did Trump change his visit what did he submit well because he knows he can't fight them or he has different battles he wants to fight I think partly it's because the he could be convinced by the lat the person he talked to in the last ten minutes but I think also that the threat of impeachment does hang over his head and he's handed the neo-cons and you know the the serious Pentagon brass the power to do or what they want you know we've seen it out earlier we saw it in Venezuela yeah but I thinking of coos yeah trumpet I can't get my head around this because I agree with you only to a certain extent because but they still are going after him even when he concedes he agrees he reverses but he gets no political capital he doesn't generate any political points that would ensure his survival daemon last twenty seconds in Ferber well I mean the problem with these outer liberals is that they have tremendous inertia they have been going after Hafez al-assad for a few dozens of years he died they went after his son even though the Sun was not a danger at all he was called a reformer but you know this is the problem they are replacing personal politics with real issues okay on that point gentlemen we've run out of time many thanks to my guests here in Moscow this is the end of our broadcast segment stay with us for the extended version on our youtube channel see you next time and remember crosshatch rules now for the extended version of our program where we have political potpourri mark Europe first goes the Trump administration led by arch neocon John Bolton has declared war on the International Criminal Court and the inner the US has not been has never ratified is not a signatory to the International Criminal Court but at least well depending on the way you look at it during the Obama years it had an envoy there and it was perfectly happy with the in criminal International Criminal Court as long as it pursued those who have lost wars and conflicts so the former Yugoslavia and Africa and Africa Sudan and so on so a Bolton this week but this time the International Criminal Court has a report that says the u.s. is responsible for torture and war crimes in Afghanistan and also started to take a look at Israel with Palestine now bringing charges through the court against them and now the u.s. is is in a fury Boulton said we will not cooperate with the International Criminal Court we will not provide assistance to the ICC we will not join the ICC we will let the IC die on its own after all for all intents and purposes the ICC is already dead to us that's us but Glenn say this what what my big problem with this is is that then it undermines the very concept of international law and if one strong power can act with impunity that if some the whole concept is a mockery I mean is Marcus pointed out the US has supported it when they went after it it's perceived or real enemies it's exactly why she really done we thought I talked about before that this breach in this breach is getting wider and wider okay I mean the Europeans I mean the hey it's in Europe okay when they have the court well at this point that historically we never really had an International Criminal Court or even this usually recognizes started with the Nuremberg trials but of course this was also a Victor's Charl whoever won the or processed English justice right because even the Nazis were saying listen how about we let some you know South Americans maybe you know send some jurist or someone to essentially trial us but essentially the argument was no we're the one who won so just as I can get behind it has always continued this powerful force to make sure they are for you reviewers I mean we're talking exactly about the same thing is the sanctity and the embrace of international law okay 45 points 45 where everyone is dealt with on it on the fair level field and yeah again this to point out that's why the Africans have always been a bit cautious start somewhere you scoff at it but you've got to start somewhere when Tony Blair because in front of the International like to see one day American officials held accountable for their crimes not John Bolton the u.s. does not recognize any authority higher than the US Constitution not the UN Charter not the International Criminal Court no what if in saying we've been saying this all along it's it's China it's Russia it's India it's it's the BRICS they want a return to the respect of the United Nations Charter okay it was the West that invented it they've abandoned it and the rest of the world wants to wants to continue embracing it because it is the only level field we have and the u.s. is going a step further Bolton promises to sanction ban and go after the finances of International Criminal Courts prosecutors judges and officials and to do the same against any state or company in the world that cooperates with the International Criminal Court if they dare to even look at an exceptional list us or galley position everything goes back to sound everything goes back to sections let me use the language of assistant Treasury secretary they want to make ICC radioactive anyone connected to it should should be viewed as someone chemical active because that's their favorite tools chemicals chemicals under that they're talking about the use of chemical weapons or nuclear weapon such a crime by going to bomb Syria if they still have chemical weapons if they use them well the language that they use to make Putin and his surrounding radioactive unquote in an assistant Treasury secretary of the United States to make the toxic how do your pians to see this in the American imposition on the court because my sense is a lot of the Europeans are very supportive of it well doesn't that they're the one who's been pushing it the hardest along and yet as well because it's not used against them yes all of course but but the United States was never one of the major states to push it again given that they didn't ratify yeah they're a big supporter of the these international laws of the seas but the u.s. never joins those covenants okay it wants everyone else to follow those rules and I think this is the case here with the International Criminal Court you know as long as it prosecutes people they don't like it's fine with them yeah well once you recognize some authority of an international criminal court essentially all of us have to recognize are some limitations on our sovereignty but usually with these institutions they promote sovereign inequality so some states preserve it others have to give it up again that's why as mentioned Africans who just finally have their sovereignty while relatively recently they're kind of skeptical about it's threatening to pull out of the International Criminal Court and if South Africa goes all of Africa will follow that when a speech gives Damon what's going on with the Orthodox which there were I would say several rumors against Russian interests about this this week you know they're the Polish foreign ministry announced that he fired all the people all the poles who graduated from the Moscow Institute of International Relations mokemo actually there for you yes which is unheard of you know people were fired for the color of their skin sir because only because they're Russian and it's not just we don't welcome them we fired them because there were hundreds of them in the Polish foreign ministry then the next step was to eliminate basically to eliminate the historical Orthodox Church in Ukraine the historical Orthodox Church in Ukraine has existed for 1,000 years it's it's been together with the Russian Church because it was one state for knowledge of this time the Church of the Moscow page that's how it's called but it's a tricky relationship they're completely the Ukrainian church is completely free independent financially they appoint their own priests their own bishops their Metropolitan seats in the Holy Council of the Russian Orthodox Church and elects participates in electing our Patrick but there was what we call a crystal community you know we we were one church symbolically so what the West wants to do is you know the the so-called ecumenical patriarch in in Istanbul Bartholomew he announced that he would give autocephalous status that means autonomous status to some kind of a new church in Ukraine but what's the politics about this is this just being intentional intentionally used to divide believers inside of Ukraine not away from Russia now make it simple for our viewers what's the point they want to dis possess this church because when the new church is created all the monasteries including some beautiful monuments of architecture all the property will go to this new church which is created by the state by mr. Perkis I mean what is what is poroshenko is thinking here and nationalists card I mean anything they to stick it to Russia I mean you know it's do they really have to break up the Orthodox Church to score a lot of political points at home do you think the Americans care won't give a hoot one way or another about yes they will certainly do and it's in all the us think tanks talking about how we need to break up the Orthodox Church it's a threat pathetic it's a threat to the US the global spread of us right the first day liberal is destroying another good thing okay the first the first two bishops which bother on you sent to Ukraine as his ambassadors to this new church not yet yet non-existent one of them is a Canadian system citizen the other one is an American citizen that tells you all about this new church that they want to marry yeah just add one thing on this polish matter because it took me by surprise because it's argued that in 1989 the the poles as well as many of the neighbors didn't go through revolution rather they went through a system change because they kept a lot of their former elites within the system Roundtable process this made it a lot more peaceful if you didn't have to top off the former but this one is very strange because now the Communist former communist 25 years illustration almost 30 yes they were deep moles okay but then you know you have Bulgarians and and Hungarians and NATO right now can only work one way if the Polish we want to get rid of anyone in their foreign ministry with any actual education this thing with the Orthodox Church is serious right this is a nation-building project to make sure that Ukraine and Russia and this will spread to Belarus as well are permanently separated because there's no question that the I come the Orthodox Church as it exists under the Moscow Patriarchate covering Russia Ukraine Belarus gives Russia soft power in Ukraine and they have to break this up good good now you spoke slowly now I understood in here dream last one that's more well the good thing about this whole story with the Orthodox Church is that Moscow protested the Moscow Patrick it finally broke its silence and protested I think we should have done it with the Olympic Games and with the discrimination of Russian athletes before I think we should have done it with many more with these graduates but discriminate against in phone unfortunately there were no official protests about it okay the church is showing us the way the church said that what happened was just word training to end this program that's the that's it for our extended version of our program we hope you enjoyed it see you next week and remember Rostock rules
