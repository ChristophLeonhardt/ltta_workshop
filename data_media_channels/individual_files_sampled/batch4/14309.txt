the Olympics they bring people from all walks of life to unite and cheer together to stand under their flag and rally behind their fellow men and women it is truly amazing race class gender just all disappear if we stand in one screaming at the top of our lungs to see our representatives victorious and have our flag and anthem at the center stage for the world to see however it would seem that this year some of our representatives won't be competing for all of us for example Lindsey Vonn a downhill skier who in an interview with CNN said quote well I hope to represent the people of the United States not the president she also said I want to represent our country well I don't think that there are a lot of people currently in our government that do that she also went on to say that she would absolutely not go to the White House if invited and let me be clear Lindsey Vonn can say or believe whatever she wants about the president but this is the one time every four years that people actually care about downhill skiing or curling why do you ask it's not because your sport is popular we cheer and rally behind you during these events because you represent us and you made a very specific statement bashing and degrading the president which half of us voted for it I mean really nowhere ever in the history of the Olympics says unless you're in a socialist dictatorship or a communist country have you ever gone there to represent your president or leader the president is just a public servant that we voted for I mean really no one has ever gone to the Olympics and saw the flag flying and thought hey that person represents the president at least until now you are there to represent America there's no agenda in competition it's not supposed to be about politics and another reason this really hurts me because as a former athlete that spent half of my life dedicated to track and field another Olympic sport that people don't care about except once every four years is because it would be the highest honor that could have been given to me to go represent my country and run for them it also must be said that I don't entirely blame Lindsey for this even though she hasn't walk back her comments I really blamed CNN the reporters and mainstream media for intentionally steering her into this conversation during the interview every single athlete that has ever gone to represent their country has had an opinion about politics going on their country but that is never the point however it seems like CNN's only point is to attack anyone right of Bernie Sanders or drive a wedge through the middle of America you think about what better way to blow up the Uniting experience that is olympic competition then by intentionally politicizing one of its top representatives and pitting them against half of the population please stop we all suffer you've already seen this happen to movies this is currently happening in the NFL and now even the Olympics is slowly becoming a victim to the mainstream media's tactics and being used as yet another divisive political weapon so annoying I've been Davies is pure Hollywood all right if you like this video and others like it please consider becoming a premium member to the rebel that way you'll have first access to pure Hollywood and the entire rebel lineup you
