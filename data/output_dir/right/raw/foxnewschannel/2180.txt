ARE THEY?

32
00:01:10,894 --> 00:01:15,164
A LOT OF THINGS POINT IN THE

33
00:01:15,164 --> 00:01:16,432
DIRECTION THAT JAMES COMEY IS

34
00:01:16,432 --> 00:01:17,233
TELLING THE TRUTH AND NOT THE

35
00:01:17,233 --> 00:01:17,667
PRESIDENT.

36
00:01:17,667 --> 00:01:19,535
WHEN YOU LOOK AT THOSE QUESTIONS

37
00:01:19,535 --> 00:01:20,837
ABOUT WHAT IS THE PRESIDENT

38
00:01:20,837 --> 00:01:22,739
THINK, WHAT DOES THE PRESIDENT

00:01:22,739 --> 00:01:26,643
FEEL, WHAT IS HE REALLY DESIRE?

40
00:01:26,643 --> 00:01:27,410
THOSE ARE ALL QUESTIONS INTENDED

41
00:01:27,410 --> 00:01:30,413
TO TRAP HIM IN SOME WAY AND

42
00:01:30,413 --> 00:01:31,247
CONTRADICTING WHAT IS IN FACT A

43
00:01:31,247 --> 00:01:33,883
VERY, VERY SOLID EXPLANATION OF

44
00:01:33,883 --> 00:01:36,653
WHAT HAPPENED.

45
00:01:36,653 --> 00:01:38,721
HE FIRED AT COMEY COMEY WOULD

46
00:01:38,721 --> 00:01:41,724
NOT -- AMONG OTHER THINGS -- SAY

47
00:01:41,724 --> 00:01:43,760
THAT HE WASN'T A TARGET OF THE

48
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:46,396
INVESTIGATION IS ENTITLED THAT.

49
00:01:46,396 --> 00:01:47,130
HILLARY CLINTON GOT THAT AND HE

50
00:01:47,130 --> 00:01:48,564
COULDN'T GET THAT.

51
00:01:48,564 --> 00:01:51,567
HE FIRED HIM AND HE SAID I'M

52
00:01:51,567 --> 00:01:54,871
FREE OF THIS GUY AND HE WENT ON

53
00:01:54,871 --> 00:01:55,905
LESTER HOLT, LESTER HOLT'S

54
00:01:55,905 --> 00:01:57,106
INTERVIEW WAS AS GOOD AS ANYBODY

55
00:01:57,106 --> 00:01:59,008
COULD DO, BETTER THAN I THINK

56
00:01:59,008 --> 00:02:01,778
ANY OF THE PEOPLE AROUND MUELLER

57
00:02:01,778 --> 00:02:03,913
COULD HAVE DONE.

58
00:02:03,913 --> 00:02:06,049
HE ASKED THEM WHY DID YOU DO IT?

59
00:02:06,049 --> 00:02:07,650
HE SAID I DID IT BECAUSE I FELT

60
00:02:07,650 --> 00:02:09,252
I HAD TO THE EXPLAINED TO THE

61
00:02:09,252 --> 00:02:10,353
AMERICAN PEOPLE THAT THE

62
00:02:10,353 --> 00:02:11,087
PRESIDENT WAS NOT THE TARGET OF

63
00:02:11,087 --> 00:02:13,923
THE INVESTIGATION.

64
00:02:13,923 --> 00:02:15,959
EVEN JAKE TAPPER PUSHED HIM

65
00:02:15,959 --> 00:02:22,065
REALLY HARD, COMEY HAD NO ANSWER

66
00:02:22,065 --> 00:02:29,472
FOR WHY HE DIDN'T SAY THIS.

67
00:02:29,472 --> 00:02:30,173
I DON'T EXPECT WERE GOING TO

68
00:02:30,173 --> 00:02:37,647
HAVE AN INTERVIEW WITH -- I

69
00:02:37,647 --> 00:02:39,782
WOULD LIKE TO GET ONE NOT UNDER

70
00:02:39,782 --> 00:02:44,821
OATH.

71
00:02:44,821 --> 00:02:45,688
I WANT TO MAKE SURE THEY DON'T

72
00:02:45,688 --> 00:02:48,324
MISREPRESENT HIS ANSWERS BUT

73
00:02:48,324 --> 00:02:50,293
THIS IS AN OUTRAGEOUS

74
00:02:50,293 --> 00:02:54,831
MISCARRIAGE OF JUSTICE.

75
00:02:54,831 --> 00:02:55,565
PLEASE CONSIDER WHETHER YOU ARE

76
00:02:55,565 --> 00:02:57,767
A REPUBLICAN OR A DEMOCRAT,

77
00:02:57,900 --> 00:02:58,701
OR YOU LOVE HIM LIKE WE DO OR

78
00:02:58,701 --> 00:03:02,005
LIKE I DO.

79
00:03:02,005 --> 00:03:03,339
SPARE HIM I THINK PEOPLE KNOW

80
00:03:03,339 --> 00:03:04,040
I'M PRETTY SUPPORTIVE.

81
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:06,275
I THINK THE SECRET IS OUT OF THE

82
00:03:06,275 --> 00:03:06,709
BAG.

83
00:03:06,709 --> 00:03:09,145
>> I WANT TO LET YOU OUT OF THE

84
00:03:09,145 --> 00:03:13,449
HOOK.

85
00:03:13,449 --> 00:03:14,650
>> Sean: FULL DISCLOSURE, RUDY

86
00:03:14,650 --> 00:03:16,786
GIULIANI AND I ONCE HAD A MEAL

87
00:03:16,786 --> 00:03:18,254
TOGETHER.

88
00:03:18,254 --> 00:03:19,522
>> YOU CAN'T POSSIBLY NOT FEEL

89
00:03:19,522 --> 00:03:22,925
AS A CITIZEN OF THE WORLD THAT

90
00:03:22,925 --> 00:03:23,826
HIS NEGOTIATIONS WITH

91
00:03:23,826 --> 00:03:25,561
NORTH KOREA ARE MUCH MORE

92
00:03:25,561 --> 00:03:27,597
SIGNIFICANT THAN THIS TOTALLY

93
00:03:27,597 --> 00:03:30,433
GARBAGE INVESTIGATION.

94
00:03:30,433 --> 00:03:31,401
>> Sean: LET ME ASK ABOUT THE

95
00:03:31,401 --> 00:03:33,870
LEGAL TEAM.

96
00:03:33,870 --> 00:03:38,174
TY COBB, JOHN DOWD, THEY ARE

97
00:03:38,174 --> 00:03:38,441
OUT.

98
00:03:38,441 --> 00:03:41,811
MY UNDERSTANDING IS TY COBB HAS

99
00:03:41,811 --> 00:03:42,578
BEEN SAYING FOR SOME TIME HE WAS

100
00:03:42,578 --> 00:03:44,514
GOING TO RETIRE.

101
00:03:44,514 --> 00:03:46,616
>> HE HAS BEEN ENORMOUSLY

102
00:03:46,616 --> 00:03:48,618
HELPFUL, HE HELPED ME WITH MY

103
00:03:48,618 --> 00:03:49,052
ORIENTATION.

104
00:03:49,052 --> 00:03:49,919
WE WOULDN'T BE WHERE WE ARE

105
00:03:49,919 --> 00:03:51,754
TODAY WHICH IS IN A VERY STRONG

106
00:03:51,754 --> 00:03:53,890
POSITION IF IT WASN'T FOR HIM

107
00:03:53,890 --> 00:03:54,857
AND JOHN.

108
00:03:54,857 --> 00:03:55,825
JOHN HAS BEEN MY FRIEND AND

109
00:03:55,825 --> 00:03:58,027
COLLEAGUE FOR 35 YEARS, I HAVE

110
00:03:58,027 --> 00:03:59,262
NOTHING BUT THE UTMOST RESPECT

111
00:03:59,262 --> 00:04:01,097
FOR JOHN DOWD.

112
00:04:01,097 --> 00:04:05,668
HE HAD THE RIGHT INSTINCT ABOUT

113
00:04:05,668 --> 00:04:06,736
THIS WHICH IS YOU'RE GOING TO

114
00:04:06,736 --> 00:04:07,470
GET HIM TO TESTIFY OVER MY DEAD

115
00:04:07,470 --> 00:04:08,438
BODY BECAUSE HE'S TRYING TO TRAP

116
00:04:08,438 --> 00:04:08,905
HIM.

117
00:04:08,905 --> 00:04:12,442
HE HAD THE INSTINCT TO SEE THAT.

118
00:04:12,442 --> 00:04:13,776
ALL THAT WORK DIDN'T GO FOR

119
00:04:13,776 --> 00:04:16,745
NOTHING, WE GOT IT ALL.

120
00:04:16,745 --> 00:04:19,682
JAY SEKULOW HAS BEEN THE ROCK.

121
00:04:19,682 --> 00:04:25,822
I COULDN'T DO IT WITHOUT HIM.

122
00:04:25,822 --> 00:04:27,623
I OFFER SOMETHING UNIQUE, I'M A

123
00:04:27,623 --> 00:04:28,991
LAWYER WHO KNOWS THE CRIMINAL

124
00:04:28,991 --> 00:04:29,659
JUSTICE SYSTEM AS WELL AS

125
00:04:29,659 --> 00:04:31,627
ANYBODY IN AMERICA.

126
00:04:31,627 --> 00:04:33,963
I'M ALSO A VERY GOOD FRIEND OF

127
00:04:33,963 --> 00:04:34,630
DONALD TRUMP.

128
00:04:34,630 --> 00:04:36,999
AND I THINK I HAVE THE

129
00:04:36,999 --> 00:04:37,767
RESPECTIVE MUELLER, THE FBI, THE

130
00:04:37,767 --> 00:04:40,470
JUSTICE DEPARTMENT.

131
00:04:40,470 --> 00:04:42,972
JEFF SESSIONS WAS MY COLLEAGUE.

132
00:04:42,972 --> 00:04:48,277
NOT JUST IN THE CAMPAIGN BUT IT

133
00:04:48,277 --> 00:04:51,948
IN 1981 WOULD HE WAS ATTORNEY IN

134
00:04:51,948 --> 00:04:52,415
ALABAMA.

135
00:04:52,415 --> 00:04:53,449
THEY NOTE THE DECISIONS I'M

136
00:04:53,449 --> 00:04:54,383
GOING TO MAKE ARE GOING TO BE IN

137
00:04:54,383 --> 00:04:57,019
THE BEST INTEREST NOT JUST OF MY

138
00:04:57,019 --> 00:04:58,087
CLIENT BUT IN THE UNITED STATES.

139
00:04:58,087 --> 00:04:58,955
AS THEY ARE OBJECTIVE, WE CAN

140
00:04:58,955 --> 00:05:00,823
WORK SOMETHING OUT.

141
00:05:00,823 --> 00:05:02,325
IF THEY'RE NOT, THEN WE HAVE TO

142
00:05:02,325 --> 00:05:05,628
SHAKE HANDS AND GO INTO A

143
00:05:05,628 --> 00:05:07,497
LITIGATION OVER DO THEY HAVE THE

144
00:05:07,497 --> 00:05:09,031
POWER TO SUBPOENA?

145
00:05:09,031 --> 00:05:12,435
I THINK THEY'VE LOST THAT POWER.

146
00:05:12,568 --> 00:05:15,671
INVESTIGATION.

147
00:05:15,805 --> 00:05:18,441
>> YOU HAVE AN INVESTIGATION IN

148
00:05:18,441 --> 00:05:19,942
WHICH MUELLER IS SELECTED TO THE

149
00:05:19,942 --> 00:05:20,710
DAY AFTER HE'S TURNED DOWN FOR

150
00:05:20,710 --> 00:05:23,045
FBI DIRECTOR BY ROD ROSENSTEIN

151
00:05:23,045 --> 00:05:25,114
WHO WAS THERE WHEN MUELLER WAS

152
00:05:25,114 --> 00:05:27,416
TURNED DOWN.

153
00:05:27,416 --> 00:05:28,551
THERE ARE THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE

154
00:05:28,551 --> 00:05:30,553
WHO COULD HAVE BEEN SELECTED FOR

155
00:05:30,553 --> 00:05:32,522
THAT JOB ALSO A FRIEND OF JAMES

156
00:05:32,522 --> 00:05:37,126
COMEY AND HE SEEMS TO BE THE

157
00:05:37,126 --> 00:05:41,297
CORE OF THEIR INVESTIGATION.

158
00:05:41,297 --> 00:05:45,334
I KNOW JAMES COMEY, I KNOW THE

159
00:05:45,334 --> 00:05:46,402
PRESIDENT.

160
00:05:46,402 --> 00:05:48,004
SORRY, JIM, YOU'RE A LIAR.

161
00:05:48,004 --> 00:05:50,573
A DISGRACEFUL LIAR, EVERY FBI

162
00:05:50,573 --> 00:05:53,276
AGENT IN AMERICA HAS HIS HEAD

163
00:05:53,276 --> 00:05:55,611
DOWN BECAUSE OF YOU.

164
00:05:55,611 --> 00:05:56,345
IT WOULD'VE BEEN GOOD IF GOD

165
00:05:56,345 --> 00:05:58,648
WOULD'VE KEPT YOU OUT OF BEING

166
00:05:58,648 --> 00:05:59,515
HEAD OF THE FBI.

167
00:05:59,515 --> 00:06:00,816
>> Sean: EXPLAIN WHERE HE

168
00:06:00,816 --> 00:06:01,617
LIED.

169
00:06:01,617 --> 00:06:02,518
>> HE LIED ABOUT HIS

170
00:06:02,518 --> 00:06:08,124
CONVERSATION WITH ANDREW

171
00:06:08,124 --> 00:06:08,791
McCABE, McCABE SHOULD

172
00:06:08,791 --> 00:06:10,760
TESTIFY AGAINST THEM.

173
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:14,163
HE ONLY TOLD THE TRUTH WHEN THE

174
00:06:14,163 --> 00:06:19,001
PRESIDENT SAID -- WE KNOW DONALD

175
00:06:20,436 --> 00:06:21,304
DONALD, IT WAS DONALD BEFORE --

176
00:06:21,304 --> 00:06:24,207
HE LIED ABOUT THE FACT THAT THEY

177
00:06:24,207 --> 00:06:25,074
TALKED ABOUT WHETHER THE

178
00:06:25,074 --> 00:06:26,642
PRESIDENT WAS A SUBJECT OR A

179
00:06:26,642 --> 00:06:27,610
TARGET AND HE IMMEDIATELY

180
00:06:27,610 --> 00:06:28,010
CHANGED IT.

181
00:06:28,010 --> 00:06:33,482
IT'S ONE LIE AFTER ANOTHER.

182
00:06:33,482 --> 00:06:34,083
>> Sean: ROD ROSENSTEIN

183
00:06:34,083 --> 00:06:34,817
EVERYBODY FORGETS WHEN HE WROTE

184
00:06:34,817 --> 00:06:37,086
THAT RECOMMENDATION TO FIRE

185
00:06:37,086 --> 00:06:39,555
COMEY, HE SAID THE FBI CANNOT BE

186
00:06:39,555 --> 00:06:42,291
REESTABLISHED IF HE STAYED.

187
00:06:42,291 --> 00:06:45,428
>> BECAUSE HE'S A LIAR.

188
00:06:45,428 --> 00:06:47,096
HIS CONDUCT OF THE

189
00:06:47,096 --> 00:06:48,064
HILLARY CLINTON INVESTIGATION

190
00:06:48,064 --> 00:06:49,565
WAS A TOTAL DISGRACE.

191
00:06:49,565 --> 00:06:50,233
IF HILLARY CLINTON HAD BEEN

192
00:06:50,233 --> 00:06:52,602
ELECTED PRESIDENT, HE WOULDN'T

193
00:06:52,602 --> 00:06:53,736
HAVE LASTED PAST DAY ONE, WE

194
00:06:53,736 --> 00:06:55,805
KNOW SHE WOULD HAVE FIRED HIM.

195
00:06:55,805 --> 00:06:56,572
I DON'T THINK SHE WOULD EVEN

196
00:06:56,572 --> 00:06:59,242
DENY THAT TODAY.

197
00:06:59,242 --> 00:07:00,643
SHE WAS RIGHT, WE SHOULD HAVE

198
00:07:00,643 --> 00:07:01,911
FIRED HIM, WHEN I SAY WE, I MEAN

199
00:07:01,911 --> 00:07:05,748
THE COLLECTIVE WE, DAY ONE.

200
00:07:05,748 --> 00:07:09,418
LET ME SAY ONE OTHER THING.

201
00:07:09,418 --> 00:07:11,921
THIS IS OUR BEST PRESIDENT IN MY

202
00:07:11,921 --> 00:07:13,289
MEMORY.

203
00:07:13,289 --> 00:07:15,224
EVEN MY HERO RONALD REAGAN, HE

204
00:07:15,224 --> 00:07:17,893
STRAINED THE ECONOMY OUT THE WAY

205
00:07:17,893 --> 00:07:20,630
PRESIDENT TRUMP DID.

206
00:07:20,630 --> 00:07:22,999
BUT HE DIDN'T GET THIS FAR AHEAD

207
00:07:22,999 --> 00:07:23,699
ON FOREIGN POLICY AS FAST AS

208
00:07:23,699 --> 00:07:24,834
PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS.

209
00:07:24,834 --> 00:07:27,370
LOOK AT WHAT IS GOING ON WITH

210
00:07:27,370 --> 00:07:27,803
NORTH KOREA.

211
00:07:27,803 --> 00:07:29,405
I TOLD THE PRESIDENT YOU'RE

212
00:07:29,405 --> 00:07:30,606
GOING TO GET THE NOBEL PEACE

213
00:07:30,606 --> 00:07:32,174
PRIZE AND MY PROUDEST MOMENT IS

214
00:07:32,174 --> 00:07:37,613
WHEN YOU TELL THEM TO SHOVE IT.

215
00:07:37,613 --> 00:07:37,913
SORRY.

216
00:07:37,913 --> 00:07:38,581
>> Sean: THIS IS CABLE, YOU

217
00:07:38,581 --> 00:07:41,617
ARE GOOD HERE.

218
00:07:41,617 --> 00:07:43,419
LET'S TALK ABOUT THE LEAK

219
00:07:43,419 --> 00:07:43,819
QUESTIONS.

220
00:07:43,819 --> 00:07:46,022
I HAVE BEEN HERE IN FRONT OF ME,

221
00:07:46,022 --> 00:07:48,424
WHAT DID YOU THINK ABOUT JIM

222
00:07:48,424 --> 00:07:49,225
COMEY, WHAT DID YOU THINK ABOUT

223
00:07:49,225 --> 00:07:52,628
JEFF SESSIONS.

224
00:07:52,628 --> 00:07:55,431
>> CALL ME SHOULD BE PROSECUTED

225
00:07:55,431 --> 00:07:56,666
FOR LEAKING CONFIDENTIAL FBI

226
00:07:56,666 --> 00:07:58,301
INFORMATION WHEN HE LEAKED HIS

227
00:07:58,301 --> 00:08:00,636
REPORT INTENDED TO DEVELOP A

228
00:08:00,770 --> 00:08:04,307
PRESIDENT OF UNITED STATES.

229
00:08:04,307 --> 00:08:08,878
I HAVE NEVER TURNED OVER -- YOU

230
00:08:08,878 --> 00:08:11,547
KNOW ME EVEN WHEN I WAS A U.S.

231
00:08:11,547 --> 00:08:13,683
ATTORNEY.

232
00:08:13,683 --> 00:08:18,821
I NEVER LEAKED A THING.

233
00:08:18,821 --> 00:08:19,622
I WOULD'VE CONSIDERED RESIGNING

234
00:08:19,622 --> 00:08:20,556
IF I EVER DID THAT OR IF ONE OF

235
00:08:20,556 --> 00:08:23,626
MY ASSISTANTS DID IT.

236
00:08:23,626 --> 00:08:25,661
DID THE FBI LEAK, DID THE SEC

237
00:08:25,661 --> 00:08:30,199
LEAK, I'M SORRY GUYS, YOU DID.

238
00:08:30,199 --> 00:08:35,538
>> Sean: THERE IS SO MANY

239
00:08:35,671 --> 00:08:37,873
DERSHOWITZ, OUR OWN

240
00:08:37,873 --> 00:08:40,842
GREGG JARRETT.

241
00:08:40,842 --> 00:08:42,010
THEY SAID THE PRESIDENT SHOULD

242
00:08:42,010 --> 00:08:42,812
NEVER SPEND A MINUTE.

243
00:08:42,812 --> 00:08:44,246
YOU SAID IT WOULD BE NARROW IN

244
00:08:44,246 --> 00:08:45,147
FOCUS AND YOU SAID NO MORE THAN

245
00:08:45,147 --> 00:08:48,384
TWO OR THREE HOURS.

246
00:08:48,384 --> 00:08:50,019
DO YOU BELIEVE ROBERT MUELLER IS

247
00:08:50,019 --> 00:08:52,154
SETTING A PERJURY TRAP FOR

248
00:08:52,154 --> 00:08:52,722
DONALD TRUMP.

249
00:08:52,722 --> 00:08:57,493
>> I HAVE TO REMAIN OPEN-MINDED

250
00:08:57,493 --> 00:08:58,527
ABOUT THIS BECAUSE EVEN THOUGH

251
00:08:58,527 --> 00:09:02,331
YOU MIGHT NOT SEE A CLEAR AVENUE

252
00:09:02,331 --> 00:09:09,205
TO QUICKLY RESOLVING THIS, WE

253
00:09:09,338 --> 00:09:14,176
SEEK A RESOLUTION THAT GETS A

254
00:09:14,176 --> 00:09:18,814
CLEAR PATH TO GETTING RESOLVED.

255
00:09:18,814 --> 00:09:21,083
I WOULD SAY RIGHT NOW THE ODDS

256
00:09:21,083 --> 00:09:23,252
ARE HE WOULDN'T BUT I DON'T

257
00:09:23,252 --> 00:09:27,189
CLOSE MY MIND TO IT.

258
00:09:27,189 --> 00:09:28,824
>> Sean: WHEN WE ARE TALKING

259
00:09:28,824 --> 00:09:30,559
ABOUT -- THIS IS REALLY

260
00:09:30,559 --> 00:09:30,960
IMPORTANT.

261
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:33,129
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE SUBPOENA

262
00:09:33,129 --> 00:09:33,863
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE SUBPOEN

263
00:09:33,863 --> 00:09:34,897
SUBPOENA.

264
00:09:34,897 --> 00:09:38,801
IN THE SUBPOENA MEANS THE

265
00:09:38,801 --> 00:09:39,502
PRESENT OF THE UNITED STATES,

266
00:09:39,502 --> 00:09:40,403
THE HILLARY STANDARD -- THE

267
00:09:40,403 --> 00:09:42,905
HILLARY STANDARD IS SIMPLE --

268
00:09:42,905 --> 00:09:46,809
NOT UNDER OATH.

269
00:09:46,809 --> 00:09:48,978
WAIT A MINUTE, YOU HAVE A GUY

270
00:09:48,978 --> 00:09:51,614
THAT HATES HILLARY AND LOVES

271
00:09:51,614 --> 00:09:52,648
DONALD TRUMP DURING THE

272
00:09:52,648 --> 00:09:53,616
INTERVIEW, THAT WOULD BE THE

273
00:09:53,616 --> 00:09:54,817
HILLARY STANDARD.

274
00:09:54,817 --> 00:09:55,951
THAT'S NOT GOING TO HAPPEN WITH

275
00:09:55,951 --> 00:09:57,219
ROBERT MUELLER.

276
00:09:57,219 --> 00:09:58,988
>> WERE NOT GOING TO GET THAT,

277
00:09:58,988 --> 00:10:00,189
COULD WE ACCEPT SOMETHING LESS

278
00:10:00,189 --> 00:10:01,424
THAN THAT, YES.

279
00:10:01,424 --> 00:10:02,358
COULD WE ACCEPT A SITUATION IN

280
00:10:02,358 --> 00:10:05,394
WHICH THEY ARE TELLING US WE

281
00:10:05,394 --> 00:10:07,563
BELIEVE COMEY WHO WAS NOW A

282
00:10:07,563 --> 00:10:09,365
PATHOLOGICAL LIAR AS OPPOSED TO

283
00:10:09,365 --> 00:10:10,199
DONALD TRUMP, THE ANSWER TO THAT

284
00:10:10,199 --> 00:10:13,636
IS NO.

285
00:10:13,636 --> 00:10:15,204
>> Sean: I HAVE BEEN THE MOST

286
00:10:15,204 --> 00:10:17,239
OUTSPOKEN LOUDEST CRITIC IN THE

287
00:10:17,239 --> 00:10:17,973
COUNTRY BESIDES THE PRESIDENT A

288
00:10:17,973 --> 00:10:21,076
LOT ROBERT MUELLER.

289
00:10:21,076 --> 00:10:23,212
A TEAM OF DEMOCRATIC DONORS, NO

290
00:10:23,212 --> 00:10:24,413
REPUBLICANS.

291
00:10:24,413 --> 00:10:25,147
PEOPLE SAY HE'S A REPUBLICAN AND

292
00:10:25,147 --> 00:10:27,082
A VETERAN, I APPLAUD HIM FOR

293
00:10:27,082 --> 00:10:29,185
SERVING HIS COUNTRY, I MEAN THAT

294
00:10:29,185 --> 00:10:29,718
SERVING HIS COUNTRY, I MEAN THA

295
00:10:29,718 --> 00:10:30,019
THAT.

296
00:10:30,019 --> 00:10:31,420
ANDREW WEISSMANN, TENS OF

297
00:10:31,420 --> 00:10:32,154
THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE LOST THEIR

298
00:10:32,154 --> 00:10:34,089
JOB AT ENRON.

299
00:10:34,089 --> 00:10:39,094
A 9-0 DECISION AGAINST ANDREW

300
00:10:39,094 --> 00:10:42,598
WEISSMANN, WHO GETS 9-0.

301
00:10:42,598 --> 00:10:44,200
FOR MERRILL LYNCH EXECUTIVES,

302
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:45,935
OVERTURNED BY THE FIFTH CIRCUIT

303
00:10:45,935 --> 00:10:48,003
OF APPEALS, HE'S EXCORIATED

304
00:10:48,003 --> 00:10:48,571
TWICE FOR WITHHOLDING

305
00:10:48,571 --> 00:10:50,172
EXCULPATORY EVIDENCE.

306
00:10:50,172 --> 00:10:51,440
THAT APPOINTMENT ALONE TELLS ME

307
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:53,876
THIS IS A BIASED TEAM.

308
00:10:53,876 --> 00:10:56,745
>> LET ME GIVE YOU TWO DIFFERENT

309
00:10:56,745 --> 00:10:57,179
VIEWS OF BOB.

310
00:10:57,179 --> 00:10:58,948
WHAT DO I KNOW THAT I COULD

311
00:10:58,948 --> 00:11:00,583
TESTIFY UNDER OATH?

312
00:11:00,583 --> 00:11:04,253
HE'S A PATRIOT, NEXT WERE NEARLY

313
00:11:04,253 --> 00:11:07,389
GOOD MAN, SERVE HIS COUNTRY.

314
00:11:07,389 --> 00:11:11,594
DID A GOOD JOB WITH THE FBI.

315
00:11:11,594 --> 00:11:12,228
I DON'T THINK HE WOULD BE

316
00:11:12,228 --> 00:11:17,233
AFFECTED BY MALICE OR PREJUDICE,

317
00:11:17,233 --> 00:11:17,867
HOWEVER, I DON'T HAVE AN

318
00:11:17,867 --> 00:11:19,301
EXPLANATION FOR THE PEOPLE THAT

319
00:11:19,301 --> 00:11:20,803
HE HIRED -- NOT ALL OF THEM,

320
00:11:20,803 --> 00:11:21,904
I'VE DEALT WITH THEM VERY

321
00:11:21,904 --> 00:11:23,939
BRIEFLY, I THINK THEY ARE VERY

322
00:11:23,939 --> 00:11:25,774
PROFESSIONAL.

323
00:11:25,774 --> 00:11:26,442
I DIDN'T DEAL WITH ANDREW

324
00:11:26,442 --> 00:11:30,379
WEISSMANN MUCH.

325
00:11:30,379 --> 00:11:32,481
>> Sean: A DISTURBED BY HIS

326
00:11:32,481 --> 00:11:32,815
RECORD?

327
00:11:32,815 --> 00:11:33,549
>> YEAH, BUT HE WOULD BE

328
00:11:33,549 --> 00:11:36,085
DISTURBED BY MINE.

329
00:11:36,085 --> 00:11:39,955
I HAVE AN OPEN MIND ABOUT BOB, I

330
00:11:39,955 --> 00:11:41,190
DON'T ABOUT COMEY.

331
00:11:41,190 --> 00:11:43,425
I KNOW COMEY MUCH BETTER, I HAVE

332
00:11:43,425 --> 00:11:44,860
THE INDIGNITY OF HAVING HIRED

333
00:11:44,860 --> 00:11:45,995
HIM FOR HIS FIRST BIG JOB AND

334
00:11:45,995 --> 00:11:48,264
I'M EMBARRASSED THAT I HIRED HIM

335
00:11:48,264 --> 00:11:48,697
I'M EMBARRASSED THAT I HIRED HI

336
00:11:48,697 --> 00:11:51,367
HIM.

337
00:11:51,367 --> 00:11:53,035
>> Sean: HE TWEETED JOHN DOWD,

338
00:11:53,035 --> 00:11:54,637
THIS ISN'T SOME GAME YOU'RE

339
00:11:54,637 --> 00:11:55,538
SCREWING WITH THE WORK OF THE

340
00:11:55,538 --> 00:11:56,238
PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES

341
00:11:56,238 --> 00:11:58,774
OF AMERICA.

342
00:11:58,774 --> 00:12:00,175
NORTH KOREA, CHINA, THE

343
00:12:00,175 --> 00:12:02,211
MIDDLE EAST, SO MUCH MORE.

344
00:12:02,211 --> 00:12:04,179
THERE IS NOT MUCH TIME TO BE

345
00:12:04,179 --> 00:12:04,980
THINKING ABOUT THIS ESPECIALLY

346
00:12:04,980 --> 00:12:07,116
SINCE THERE IS NO RUSH OF

347
00:12:07,116 --> 00:12:08,584
COLLUSION.

348
00:12:08,584 --> 00:12:09,518
IT'S BEEN GOING ON, HOW MANY

349
00:12:09,518 --> 00:12:13,589
CONGRESSIONAL INVESTIGATIONS?

350
00:12:13,589 --> 00:12:15,591
THERE IS NO EVIDENCE OF

351
00:12:15,591 --> 00:12:16,325
TRUMP-RUSSIA COLLUSION, HOW DID

352
00:12:16,325 --> 00:12:20,062
WE END UP I'M THERE TO STORMY

353
00:12:20,062 --> 00:12:21,997
DANIELS?

354
00:12:21,997 --> 00:12:24,033
>> I THINK THIS IS BEING DONE

355
00:12:24,033 --> 00:12:25,167
BEHIND A MUELLER'S BACK, BECAUSE

356
00:12:25,167 --> 00:12:27,336
THEY COME TO HIM --

357
00:12:27,336 --> 00:12:29,471
>> Sean: HE DOESN'T READ A

358
00:12:29,471 --> 00:12:29,838
NEWSPAPER?

359
00:12:29,838 --> 00:12:31,140
>> THIS HAS BECOME A WITCH HUNT

360
00:12:31,140 --> 00:12:33,809
THE PRESIDENT SAID.

361
00:12:33,809 --> 00:12:35,311
IF YOU LOOK AT THOSE QUESTIONS,

362
00:12:35,311 --> 00:12:39,582
THEY ARE TRAP QUESTIONS.

363
00:12:39,582 --> 00:12:40,349
A FIRST-YEAR PROSECUTOR WOULD DO

364
00:12:40,349 --> 00:12:42,785
BETTER THAN THAT.

365
00:12:42,785 --> 00:12:44,486
HE'S IN VERY GOOD HANDS, I DON'T

366
00:12:44,486 --> 00:12:46,722
JUST MEET ME, I MEAN JAY AND THE

367
00:12:46,722 --> 00:12:49,725
WHOLE TEAM AND TY COBB GETS A

368
00:12:49,725 --> 00:12:53,329
GREAT DEAL OF CREDIT FOR THIS,

369
00:12:53,329 --> 00:12:55,297
I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO WORKING

370
00:12:55,297 --> 00:12:56,765
WITH EMMETT WHO HANDLES THE

371
00:12:56,765 --> 00:13:00,603
CLINTON INVESTIGATION.

372
00:13:00,603 --> 00:13:01,370
AND THEN BUSH, THIS IS NOT A

373
00:13:01,370 --> 00:13:04,974
POLITICAL GUY.

374
00:13:04,974 --> 00:13:07,309
>> Sean: HE SAID IF THEY ARE

375
00:13:07,309 --> 00:13:11,680
OBJECTIVE, WE ARE MORE LIKELY TO

376
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:12,214
COOPERATE.

377
00:13:12,214 --> 00:13:13,649
IF THEY ARE LESS OBJECTIVE, WE

378
00:13:13,649 --> 00:13:18,020
WOULD BE FOOLISH TO DO THAT.

379
00:13:18,020 --> 00:13:19,788
>> I CAN'T IMAGINE THEY WOULD

380
00:13:19,788 --> 00:13:21,023
TAKE MUCH LONGER, IT'S COMING TO

381
00:13:21,023 --> 00:13:21,724
A HEAD RIGHT NOW.

382
00:13:21,724 --> 00:13:23,826
THERE'S NOT MUCH MORE TO THINK

383
00:13:23,826 --> 00:13:25,394
ABOUT.

384
00:13:25,394 --> 00:13:26,895
IF THEY CAN GET US IN A POSITION

385
00:13:26,895 --> 00:13:33,168
WHERE WE RECOMMENDED TO THE

386
00:13:33,302 --> 00:13:36,805
PRESIDENT TRUMP.

387
00:13:36,805 --> 00:13:38,874
IF HE DOESN'T IT'S GOING TO BE

388
00:13:38,874 --> 00:13:41,176
BECAUSE JAY AND I AND OTHERS SAY

389
00:13:41,176 --> 00:13:43,379
NO.

390
00:13:43,379 --> 00:13:44,913
WILL STAND UP THERE AND SAY WE

391
00:13:44,913 --> 00:13:45,614
ARE LAWYERS, YOU'VE GOT TO

392
00:13:45,614 --> 00:13:47,616
LISTEN TO THE PRESIDENT.

393
00:13:47,616 --> 00:13:48,550
I THINK I AM THERE BECAUSE I'M

394
00:13:48,550 --> 00:13:53,022
HIS FRIEND.

395
00:13:53,022 --> 00:13:54,223
>> Sean: I THINK YOUR

396
00:13:54,223 --> 00:13:55,024
BACKGROUND AS AN ATTORNEY ALL

397
00:13:55,024 --> 00:13:57,626
THE YEARS AND MAYOR  -- I AGREE

398
00:13:57,626 --> 00:14:00,195
WITH THE PRESIDENT'S STATEMENT.

399
00:14:00,195 --> 00:14:00,996
I HAVE BEEN VERY OPEN AND SAYING

400
00:14:00,996 --> 00:14:04,667
THAT THIS IS A SETUP, THIS IS A

401
00:14:04,667 --> 00:14:08,203
SUBPOENA, THIS IS A PERJURY TRAP

402
00:14:08,203 --> 00:14:09,972
AND LET'S WALK THROUGH WHAT IF

403
00:14:09,972 --> 00:14:15,778
THEY ISSUE A SUBPOENA.

404
00:14:15,778 --> 00:14:17,579
WHAT IF THEY DECIDED NOT TO

405
00:14:17,579 --> 00:14:18,614
TALK, THEY SEND HIM BEFORE A

406
00:14:18,614 --> 00:14:21,383
GRAND JURY BECAUSE IT BECOMES

407
00:14:21,383 --> 00:14:22,651
TRICKY AS ALAN DERSHOWITZ HAS

408
00:14:22,651 --> 00:14:24,987
DESCRIBED ON THIS SHOW.

409
00:14:24,987 --> 00:14:25,721
IF THE PRESIDENT PLEADS THE

410
00:14:25,721 --> 00:14:26,989
FIFTH WHICH HE DOESN'T WANT TO

411
00:14:26,989 --> 00:14:29,525
DO, HE SAID HE DOESN'T WANT TO

412
00:14:29,525 --> 00:14:31,694
DO, THEN THEY GIVE HIM

413
00:14:31,694 --> 00:14:35,197
IMMUNITY -- THEN WHAT?

414
00:14:35,197 --> 00:14:37,900
>> I THINK ALAN POINTED THIS OUT

415
00:14:37,900 --> 00:14:40,969
LAST NIGHT BUT NOT IN DETAIL.

416
00:14:40,969 --> 00:14:42,504
IF THEY ISSUE A SUBPOENA, THAT

417
00:14:42,504 --> 00:14:45,307
WILL BE UNPRECEDENTED IN THE

418
00:14:45,307 --> 00:14:47,042
SENSE THAT IT'S CLEAR THAT A

419
00:14:47,042 --> 00:14:47,843
PRESIDENT CAN'T BE SUBPOENAED TO

420
00:14:47,843 --> 00:14:49,745
A CRIMINAL PROCEEDING ABOUT HIM.

421
00:14:49,745 --> 00:14:54,616
WHY IS THAT?

422
00:14:54,616 --> 00:14:55,384
FORTUNATELY OR MAYBE

423
00:14:55,384 --> 00:14:56,552
UNFORTUNATELY WE HAVE A REAL

424
00:14:56,552 --> 00:14:59,588
LIFE CIRCUMSTANCE GOING ON THAT

425
00:14:59,588 --> 00:15:01,523
THE FOUNDING FATHERS THOUGHT

426
00:15:01,523 --> 00:15:02,424
ABOUT.

427
00:15:02,424 --> 00:15:03,525
THE PRESIDENT CANNOT BE

428
00:15:03,525 --> 00:15:05,194
DISTRACTED BY A CRIMINAL

429
00:15:05,194 --> 00:15:05,761
INVESTIGATION.

430
00:15:05,761 --> 00:15:07,196
YOU CAN ALWAYS PROSECUTE HIM

431
00:15:07,196 --> 00:15:07,963
AFTER, THEY CAN GET HIM WHEN HE

432
00:15:07,963 --> 00:15:09,765
LEAVES THE WHITE HOUSE.

433
00:15:09,765 --> 00:15:12,868
YOU CAN ALWAYS PROSECUTE HIM

434
00:15:12,868 --> 00:15:17,339
AFTER BUT IF MUELLER TO    SAIDT

435
00:15:17,339 --> 00:15:17,573
AFTER BUT IF MUELLER TO    SAIDO

436
00:15:17,573 --> 00:15:17,606
AFTER BUT IF MUELLER TO    SAIDM

437
00:15:17,606 --> 00:15:17,940
AFTER BUT IF MUELLER TO    SAIDE

438
00:15:17,940 --> 00:15:19,975
TOMORROW BRING HIM IN TWO HOURS,

439
00:15:19,975 --> 00:15:21,243
NO QUESTIONS YOU DON'T WANT AND

440
00:15:21,243 --> 00:15:23,445
WE ARE READY TO CLEAR HIM, I

441
00:15:23,445 --> 00:15:24,179
COULD NOT GO TO THE PRESIDENT OF

442
00:15:24,179 --> 00:15:25,247
THE UNITED STATES AND SAY TAKE

443
00:15:25,247 --> 00:15:28,484
TWO DAYS OFF TO GET READY FOR

444
00:15:28,484 --> 00:15:29,618
THAT AND SCREW THE WHOLE THING

445
00:15:29,618 --> 00:15:32,788
WITH NORTH KOREA.

446
00:15:32,788 --> 00:15:34,590
HOW CAN ANY AMERICAN DO THAT?

447
00:15:34,590 --> 00:15:38,460
HE'S OUR PRESIDENT.

448
00:15:38,460 --> 00:15:41,063
HE IS GOING TO NEGOTIATE I

449
00:15:41,063 --> 00:15:43,465
BELIEVE A NONNUCLEAR SITUATION

450
00:15:43,465 --> 00:15:46,969
ON THE KOREAN PENINSULA.

451
00:15:46,969 --> 00:15:48,003
>> Sean: NOBODY THOUGHT ABOUT

452
00:15:48,003 --> 00:15:48,303
THAT.

453
00:15:48,303 --> 00:15:50,339
>> YOU'RE GOING TO INTERFERE

454
00:15:50,339 --> 00:15:50,706
WITH THAT?

455
00:15:50,706 --> 00:15:51,673
THAT'S WHY THE FOUNDING FATHERS

456
00:15:51,673 --> 00:15:53,742
CREATED TO THIS IMMUNITY FROM

457
00:15:53,742 --> 00:15:56,845
PROSECUTION AND SUBPOENA.

458
00:15:56,845 --> 00:16:00,783
IF IT'S A CIVIL CASE, CLINTON

459
00:16:00,783 --> 00:16:01,517
SUBMITTED BECAUSE OF THE CIVIL

460
00:16:01,517 --> 00:16:02,785
CASE.

461
00:16:02,785 --> 00:16:05,187
>> Sean: WERE NOT WRITTEN

462
00:16:05,187 --> 00:16:05,587
ANSWERS?

463
00:16:05,587 --> 00:16:06,789
>> WHICH RONALD REAGAN DID.

464
00:16:06,789 --> 00:16:09,391
>> Sean: WHY NOT THAT?

465
00:16:09,391 --> 00:16:11,360
>> THEY SAID NO TO THAT.

466
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:13,962
>> Sean: THE PRESIDENT SAYS --

467
00:16:13,962 --> 00:16:15,197
AND THEY'RE GOING TO WHAT?

468
00:16:15,197 --> 00:16:18,200
>> AT THIS POINT I'M NOT SURE I

469
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:18,867
WOULD GIVE WRITTEN ANSWERS

470
00:16:18,867 --> 00:16:19,601
BECAUSE THEY'RE GOING TO TRY TO

471
00:16:19,601 --> 00:16:23,172
CONTRADICT THEM.

472
00:16:23,172 --> 00:16:25,307
I BELIEVE THAT ATTORNEY GENERAL

473
00:16:25,307 --> 00:16:26,975
SESSIONS AND ROSENSTEIN WHO I

474
00:16:26,975 --> 00:16:28,410
DON'T KNOW, I BELIEVE THEY

475
00:16:28,410 --> 00:16:29,077
SHOULD IN THE INTEREST OF

476
00:16:29,077 --> 00:16:31,680
JUSTICE AND THIS INVESTIGATION.

477
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:33,715
THERE'S BEEN TOO MUCH GOVERNMENT

478
00:16:33,715 --> 00:16:35,584
MISCONDUCT.

479
00:16:35,584 --> 00:16:37,085
THE CRIMES NOW HAVE ALL BEEN

480
00:16:37,085 --> 00:16:37,820
COMMITTED BY THE GOVERNMENT AND

481
00:16:37,820 --> 00:16:38,720
THEIR AGENTS.

482
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:43,525
THE LIES BY COMEY.

483
00:16:43,525 --> 00:16:51,967
IT'S TERRIBLE.

484
00:16:51,967 --> 00:16:52,534
>> Sean: WHAT ARE THE

485
00:16:52,534 --> 00:16:55,871
PARAMETERS YOU WOULD INSIST ON

486
00:16:55,871 --> 00:16:58,807
WITH MOLAR IN 2-3 HOURS.

487
00:16:58,807 --> 00:17:00,609
>> NEVER BEYOND 2-3 HOURS.

488
00:17:00,609 --> 00:17:02,077
I'M NOT GOING TO HAVE MY CLIENT,

489
00:17:02,077 --> 00:17:10,252
MY PRESIDENT, MY FRIEND -- I'M

490
00:17:10,252 --> 00:17:11,553
NOT GOING TO LET HIM BE TREATED

491
00:17:11,553 --> 00:17:14,089
WORSE THAN BILL CLINTON WHO

492
00:17:14,089 --> 00:17:16,391
DEFINITELY WAS A LIAR UNDER OATH

493
00:17:16,391 --> 00:17:16,858
DEFINITELY WAS A LIAR UNDER OAT

494
00:17:16,858 --> 00:17:18,961
OATH.

495
00:17:18,961 --> 00:17:20,395
HE'S BEING TREATED MUCH WORSE

496
00:17:20,395 --> 00:17:21,128
THAN HILLARY CLINTON WHO HAD NO

497
00:17:21,128 --> 00:17:24,165
RIGHT TO ANY OF THAT STUFF.

498
00:17:24,165 --> 00:17:25,367
I'M NOT GOING TO LET HIM BE

499
00:17:25,367 --> 00:17:27,269
TREATED WORSE THAN

500
00:17:27,269 --> 00:17:29,304
HILLARY CLINTON.

501
00:17:29,304 --> 00:17:31,573
I THINK JAY AND I WILL INSIST

502
00:17:31,573 --> 00:17:32,975
THEY ARE GOING TO HAVE TO TREAT

503
00:17:32,975 --> 00:17:35,410
HIM THE SAME WAY AS CLINTON, TWO

504
00:17:35,410 --> 00:17:36,845
AND A HALF HOURS, THEY END, WE

505
00:17:36,845 --> 00:17:38,080
WALK OUT, GIVE US YOUR QUESTIONS

506
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:40,282
IN ADVANCE.

507
00:17:40,282 --> 00:17:45,387
HE IS READY TO --

508
00:17:45,387 --> 00:17:46,688
[LAUGHS]

509
00:17:46,688 --> 00:17:49,391
HE'S READY TO GO!

510
00:17:49,391 --> 00:17:50,192
IF WE AREN'T CAREFUL LAWYERS, WE

511
00:17:50,192 --> 00:17:53,362
JUST LET HIM GO.

512
00:17:53,362 --> 00:17:54,429
I REMEMBER THE DEBATES THAT I

513
00:17:54,429 --> 00:17:55,864
PREPARED HIM FOR IN PART WITH

514
00:17:55,864 --> 00:00:00,000
CHRIS CHRISTIE.
