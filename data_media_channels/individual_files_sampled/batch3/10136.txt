with the tide now fully turned against Islamic state in Syria there is renewed hope that a political solution could finally bring peace let's cross live now to the Russian city of Sochi hosting the talks that could bring around an end to this ongoing conflict artis Ilya Petrecca now joining us good morning to you many countries keeping a close watch on today's potential developments for Syria what are the expectations so far worried good morning well let's say that there's hope for a few promising opportunities what if the name Sochi eventually gets associated with some kind of accord or agreement because the people who really have a say in trying to get to the point when we will be able to say no civil war and Syria are all here and now is the time because ISIL lost its last city in Syria now they're in control only of a few villages in some parts of the desert okay that is thanks to the Syrian army along with the russian air force on the one hand and on the other hand the kurds some elements of the Syrian opposition backed by the US but who has been here in Sochi this week already Syrian President Bashar Assad that was quite a surprise the visit was kept a secret for a long time we haven't seen the US president Donald Trump but mr. Putin was on the phone with him for an hour and on Wednesday we're having quite a company here Hassan rouhani type aired one and Vladimir Putin and I'll tell you what if it wasn't for these men we wouldn't have seen the astana peace talks happening so we keep hearing the astronaut peace process the Syria talks in Astana but why are they so important and why as turkey Russia and Iran important here they are the guarantors of the four de-escalation zones that have become the main outcome of the negotiations in the Kazakh capital and what they were able to bring about is a significant reduction of violence on the ground and humanitarian aid finally being delivered to parts of Syria where it's needed most and that brings us to the issue of whether the u.s. is somehow involved in this or not I can tell you that Astana began under the Obama administration he was still in office back then and his officials were asked questions about the u.s. involvement in this mr. Kerry doesn't see it as a snub no the secretary doesn't see this business not that at all does he not at least feel the u.s. is being sidelined if not excluded from what was something the US was leading on we are not excluded we are not being sidelined is quite different than wheat Israel before and we are still eating right now this leadership that you're speaking of is all past tense is that not true I would disagree well things are different twelve months later Vladimir Putin as I've said has been updating Donald Trump on the phone about his talks with Bashar al-assad and again he is welcoming the presidents of Turkey and Iran so this kind of involvement of so many sides from Washington to Iran through Tehran sorry really gives us the reason to say that there are some promising opportunities and it is all happening here in Sochi and all eyes will stay on Sochi today RTZ Lipa tranqer there live on what could be the latest developments for Syria thanks very much
