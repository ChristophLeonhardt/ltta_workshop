THANK YOU. 

23
00:00:27,826 --> 00:00:35,502
>> WE WILL HAVE TIME FOR Q&A AT 

24
00:00:35,502 --> 00:00:38,338
THE END. 

25
00:00:38,338 --> 00:00:41,107
THANKS FOR THAT. 

26
00:00:41,107 --> 00:00:43,877

ALL RIGHT. 

29
00:00:51,418 --> 00:00:51,718
ALL RIGHT. 

30
00:00:51,718 --> 00:00:53,620
SO IN REGARDS TO FLORENCE, JUST 

31
00:00:53,620 --> 00:00:54,487
BECAUSE THE WIND SPEEDS CAME 

32
00:00:54,487 --> 00:00:56,489
DOWN INTENSITY OF THE STORM 

33
00:00:56,489 --> 00:00:57,957
CAME DOWN TO CAT 2, PLEASE 

34
00:00:57,957 --> 00:01:00,226
DON'T LET YOUR GUARD DOWN. 

35
00:01:00,226 --> 00:01:00,760
THE STORM SURGE FORECAST 

36
00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:03,363
ASSOCIATED WITH THERE STORM HAS 

37
00:01:03,363 --> 00:01:03,696
NOT CHANGED. 

38
00:01:03,696 --> 00:01:06,332
IT HAS REMAINED THE SAME AND 

39
00:01:06,332 --> 00:01:06,733
HERE'S WHY. 

40
00:01:06,733 --> 00:01:07,634
AS THE SYSTEM'S ENCROACHING ON 

41
00:01:07,634 --> 00:01:08,701
THE COAST THE WIND FIELD IS 

42
00:01:08,701 --> 00:01:09,769
EXPANDING SO WHAT YOU ARE GOING 

43
00:01:09,769 --> 00:01:11,037
TO START SEEING IN A MATTER OF 

44
00:01:11,037 --> 00:01:14,374
HOURS AND IN THE NEXT COMING 

45
00:01:14,374 --> 00:01:16,142
HOURS IS THESE WIND BANDS THAT 

46
00:01:16,142 --> 00:01:17,944
FAR PRECEDE THE CENTER OF 

47
00:01:17,944 --> 00:01:18,945
CIRCULATION ARE GOING TO START 

48
00:01:18,945 --> 00:01:20,613
PUSHING WATER UP AGAINST THE 

49
00:01:20,613 --> 00:01:21,347
COAST BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY, UP 

50
00:01:21,347 --> 00:01:23,449
THE BACK BAY AND INLAND AREAS. 

51
00:01:23,449 --> 00:01:25,685
STORM SURGE IS NOT A PROBLEM 

52
00:01:25,685 --> 00:01:26,252
JUST ALONG THE COASTLINE. 

53
00:01:26,252 --> 00:01:28,755
IT'S GOING TO BE A MAJOR 

54
00:01:28,755 --> 00:01:29,222
PROBLEM. 

55
00:01:29,222 --> 00:01:30,590
WAY UP INTO THE STREAMS AND 

56
00:01:30,590 --> 00:01:32,158
TRIBUTARIES THAT COME OUT OF 

57
00:01:32,158 --> 00:01:34,861
SOUND AREAS THAT PUSH UP INTO 

58
00:01:34,861 --> 00:01:35,428
THE SOUNDS. 

59
00:01:35,428 --> 00:01:36,429
LIKE THE PIMLICO SOUND ON THE 

60
00:01:36,429 --> 00:01:37,530
WEST SIDE OF THE SOUND. 

61
00:01:37,530 --> 00:01:39,499
THIS IS A VERY DANGEROUS STORM. 

62
00:01:39,499 --> 00:01:41,034
STORM SURGE IS WHY YOU HAVE 

63
00:01:41,034 --> 00:01:44,036
BEEN PLACED UNDER MANY OF YOU 

64
00:01:44,036 --> 00:01:45,171
HAVE BEEN PLACED UNDER 

65
00:01:45,171 --> 00:01:46,973
EVACUATION AND WE ARE ASKING 

66
00:01:46,973 --> 00:01:48,741
CITIZENS TO PLEASE HEED THE 

67
00:01:48,741 --> 00:01:49,008
WARNING. 

68
00:01:49,008 --> 00:01:49,608
YOUR TIME IS RUNNING OUT. 

69
00:01:49,608 --> 00:01:52,478
THE OCEAN IS GOING TO START 

70
00:01:52,478 --> 00:01:52,779
RISING. 

71
00:01:52,779 --> 00:01:53,179
ALONG THE COAST. 

72
00:01:53,179 --> 00:01:54,380
AND IN THE BACK BAY AND INLAND 

73
00:01:54,380 --> 00:01:55,915
AREAS AND THE SOUND AREAS 

74
00:01:55,915 --> 00:01:57,249
WITHIN A MATTER OF HOURS. 

75
00:01:57,249 --> 00:01:58,585
YOUR TIME TO GET OUT OF THE 

76
00:01:58,585 --> 00:02:00,353
THOSE AREAS AND STORM SURGE 

77
00:02:00,353 --> 00:02:03,223
INUNDATION IS COMING TO A 

78
00:02:03,223 --> 00:02:04,757
CLOSE. 

79
00:02:04,757 --> 00:02:05,458
I CAN'T EMPHASIZE THAT ENOUGH. 

80
00:02:05,458 --> 00:02:06,292
WITH THAT, THE OTHER THING 

81
00:02:06,292 --> 00:02:07,193
THAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN IS NOT 

82
00:02:07,193 --> 00:02:10,229
ONLY ARE WE GOING TO SEE HIGH 

83
00:02:10,229 --> 00:02:11,630
WINDS, 110-MILE AN HOUR 

84
00:02:11,630 --> 00:02:13,565
SUSTAINED WINDS COMING UPON THE 

85
00:02:13,565 --> 00:02:16,369
COAST, THE WIND FIELD IS LARGE. 

86
00:02:16,369 --> 00:02:17,636
THERE ARE HURRICANE-FORCE WINDS 

87
00:02:17,636 --> 00:02:20,473
THAT EXTEND FAR OUT FROM THE 

88
00:02:20,473 --> 00:02:21,073
CENTER OF CIRCULATION. 

89
00:02:21,073 --> 00:02:21,707
THAT WILL NOT ONLY INUNDATE THE 

90
00:02:21,707 --> 00:02:24,277
COAST BUT YOU ARE GOING TO SEE 

91
00:02:24,277 --> 00:02:25,645
SOME HIGH INLAND WINDS AS THE 

92
00:02:25,645 --> 00:02:26,845
STORM STARTS TO COME IN AND 

93
00:02:26,845 --> 00:02:29,448
PUSH INTO THE COAST. 

94
00:02:29,448 --> 00:02:31,117
COUPLED WITH THAT IS COPIOUS 

95
00:02:31,117 --> 00:02:32,218
AMOUNTS OF RAINFALL AS THE 

96
00:02:32,218 --> 00:02:32,919
SYSTEM IS PULLING A LOT OF 

97
00:02:32,919 --> 00:02:34,120
MOISTURE OUT OF THE OCEAN. 

98
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:38,024
AND YOU ARE ALREADY SEEING RAIN 

99
00:02:38,024 --> 00:02:39,458
BANDS COME ALONG THE CAROLINA 

100
00:02:39,458 --> 00:02:40,059
SHORELINE AND UNFORTUNATELY, 

101
00:02:40,059 --> 00:02:41,094
THESE RAIN BANDS ARE GOING TO 

102
00:02:41,094 --> 00:02:43,596
BE WITH US FOR SEVERAL DAYS. 

103
00:02:43,596 --> 00:02:46,766
WE'RE GOING TO YOU KNOW -- THE 

104
00:02:46,766 --> 00:02:48,801
FORECASTERS ARE BASICALLY 

105
00:02:48,801 --> 00:02:49,334
INDICATING FEET OF RAIN. 

106
00:02:49,334 --> 00:02:50,870
NOT INCHES. 

107
00:02:50,870 --> 00:02:52,505
IN PORTIONS OF THE CAROLINAS 

108
00:02:52,505 --> 00:02:52,938
AND INTO VIRGINIA. 

109
00:02:52,938 --> 00:02:54,440
SO THIS IS A VERY DANGEROUS 

110
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:54,673
STORM. 

111
00:02:54,673 --> 00:02:57,243
INLAND FLOODING KILLS A LOT OF 

112
00:02:57,243 --> 00:02:57,710
PEOPLE UNFORTUNATELY. 

113
00:02:57,710 --> 00:03:01,114
AND THAT'S WHAT WE'RE ABOUT TO 

114
00:03:01,114 --> 00:03:01,314
SEE. 

115
00:03:01,314 --> 00:03:02,148
SO PLEASE REMEMBER THAT. 

116
00:03:02,148 --> 00:03:03,383
THE OTHER THING IS THAT I WANT 

117
00:03:03,383 --> 00:03:04,584
-- I WANT EVERYBODY TO KNOW 

118
00:03:04,584 --> 00:03:08,721

SUPPORT. 

128
00:03:23,937 --> 00:03:24,337
AS THE -- SPORT. 

129
00:03:24,337 --> 00:03:26,873
AS THE SYSTEM PUSHES THROUGH 

130
00:03:26,873 --> 00:03:27,640
RIGHT NOW. 

131
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:28,741
LARGELY FOCUSED ON LIFE SAFETY 

132
00:03:28,741 --> 00:03:31,477
AND SUPPORTING MASS CARE AND 

133
00:03:31,477 --> 00:03:31,944
EVACUATION MOVEMENT,. 

134
00:03:31,944 --> 00:03:33,212
AS THE SYSTEM PUSHES THROUGH 

135
00:03:33,212 --> 00:03:35,148
STARTS TO EXIT THE CAROLINAS 

136
00:03:35,148 --> 00:03:36,582
AND VIRGINIA AND YOU KNOW, THE 

137
00:03:36,582 --> 00:03:37,416
THREAT CEASES. 

138
00:03:37,416 --> 00:03:40,286
WE'RE GOING TO BE FOCUSED ON 

139
00:03:40,286 --> 00:03:41,521
STABILIZING WHAT WE CALL 

140
00:03:41,521 --> 00:03:41,988
COMMUNITY LIFELINES. 

141
00:03:41,988 --> 00:03:44,057
FOR EXAMPLE, WE'VE GOT TO 

142
00:03:44,057 --> 00:03:44,957
QUICKLY UNDERSTAND THE DAMAGE 

143
00:03:44,957 --> 00:03:46,893
THAT'S BEEN DONE TO THE 

144
00:03:46,893 --> 00:03:48,728
TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS THE 

145
00:03:48,728 --> 00:03:49,995
COMMUNICATIONS SYSTEMS. 

146
00:03:49,995 --> 00:03:50,697
THE POWER SYSTEMS. 

147
00:03:50,697 --> 00:03:52,231
AND WE ARE POSITIONING AND HAVE 

148
00:03:52,231 --> 00:03:53,199
BEEN POSITIONED FOR MULTIPLE 

149
00:03:53,199 --> 00:03:55,802
DAYS NOW TO BE READY TO GET 

150
00:03:55,802 --> 00:03:56,436
THOSE CRITICAL LIFELINES BACK 

151
00:03:56,436 --> 00:03:59,505
UP AND STABLE AS QUICKLY AS WE 

152
00:03:59,505 --> 00:04:00,106
CAN. 

153
00:04:00,106 --> 00:04:01,274
BUT LET ME SET THE 

154
00:04:01,274 --> 00:04:01,808
EXPECTATIONS. 

155
00:04:01,808 --> 00:04:03,342
THIS IS A VERY DANGEROUS STORM. 

156
00:04:03,342 --> 00:04:04,710
WE CALL THEM DISASTERS BECAUSE 

157
00:04:04,710 --> 00:04:05,778
THEY BREAK THINGS. 

158
00:04:05,778 --> 00:04:07,513
THE INFRASTRUCTURE IS GOING TO 

159
00:04:07,513 --> 00:04:07,746
BREAK. 

160
00:04:07,746 --> 00:04:09,482
THE POWER IS GOING TO GO OUT. 

161
00:04:09,482 --> 00:04:11,184
IT COULD GO OUT FOR A NUMBER OF 

162
00:04:11,184 --> 00:04:12,051
DAYS AND MANY WEEKS IT'S HARD 

163
00:04:12,051 --> 00:04:14,654
TO SAY AT THIS POINT. 

164
00:04:14,654 --> 00:04:17,423
SO NOT ONLY THAT, BUT MANY OF 

165
00:04:17,423 --> 00:04:19,459
YOU WHO HAVE EVACUATED FROM THE 

166
00:04:19,459 --> 00:04:20,726
CAROLINA COASTLINES ARE GOING 

167
00:04:20,726 --> 00:04:23,462
TO BE DISPLACED FOR A WHILE. 

168
00:04:23,462 --> 00:04:24,964
PARTICULARLY WHERE THE AREAS 

169
00:04:24,964 --> 00:04:26,165
RECEIVE THE HIGHEST AMOUNTS OF 

170
00:04:26,165 --> 00:04:26,498
STORM SURGE. 

171
00:04:26,498 --> 00:04:29,469
SO YOU KNOW, WE NEED PEOPLE TO 

172
00:04:29,469 --> 00:04:30,903
GET THEIR MINDSETS RIGHT. 

173
00:04:30,903 --> 00:04:32,038
THAT DISASTERS ARE VERY 

174
00:04:32,038 --> 00:04:32,505
FRUSTRATING. 

175
00:04:32,505 --> 00:04:33,806
AND IT TAKES TIME TO GET THE 

176
00:04:33,806 --> 00:04:34,407
INFRASTRUCTURE BACK UP AND 

177
00:04:34,407 --> 00:04:36,409
RUNNING BUT WE ARE GOING TO DO 

178
00:04:36,409 --> 00:04:37,910
EVERYTHING THAT WE CAN TO PUSH 

179
00:04:37,910 --> 00:04:40,346
FORWARD AS QUICKLY AS WE CAN TO 

180
00:04:40,346 --> 00:04:42,682
GET THINGS BACK UP AND WORKING 

181
00:04:42,682 --> 00:04:44,217
ALONG WITH OUR STATE PARTNERS 

182
00:04:44,217 --> 00:04:46,119
IN THE PRIVATE SECTOR WHO OWNS 

183
00:04:46,119 --> 00:04:47,286
A LARGE PORTION OF THE CRITICAL 

184
00:04:47,286 --> 00:04:48,820
INFRASTRUCTURE THAT'S GOING TO 

185
00:04:48,820 --> 00:04:49,154
BE IMPACTE. 

186
00:04:49,154 --> 00:04:51,324
WITH THAT, I WANT TO QUICKLY 

187
00:04:51,324 --> 00:04:57,196

THE EXPANSE OF THIS STORM. 

257
00:06:53,079 --> 00:06:53,913

THIS IS A TREMENDOUSLY LARGE

STORM AND WHEN IT SLOWS DOWN 

263
00:07:00,553 --> 00:07:02,288
WHAT YOU WILL SEE IS THIS

COMBINED WITH THE ONSHORE FLOW 

274
00:07:15,368 --> 00:07:17,203
IT'S GOING TO BE VERY HARD FOR

276
00:07:17,703 --> 00:07:20,673

LANDFALL. 

614
00:17:01,153 --> 00:17:02,588
IT'S STILL AT A CATEGORY 2. BUT 

615
00:17:02,588 --> 00:17:03,956
YOU KNOW, THAT STILL MEANS THAT 

616
00:17:03,956 --> 00:17:05,491
IT'S GOING TO BE A RAINMAKER SO 

617
00:17:05,491 --> 00:17:06,825
THE WINDS HAVE DIED DOWN A 

618
00:17:06,825 --> 00:17:10,162
LITTLE BIT AND IT'S REALLY JUST 

619
00:17:10,162 --> 00:17:12,763
SORT OF A ONE MILE AN HOUR AWAY 

620
00:17:12,763 --> 00:17:13,632
FROM BEING CATEGORY 3. THE 

621
00:17:13,632 --> 00:17:14,833
WINDS HAVE DIED DOWN BUT THE

00:17:14,833 --> 00:17:16,367
STORM SURGE AND FLOODING STILL 

623
00:17:16,367 --> 00:17:17,169
A MAJOR RISK. 

624
00:17:17,169 --> 00:17:20,038
>> SO LET'S GET MORE ON THIS 

625
00:17:20,038 --> 00:17:22,273
FROM MOLA LENGHI JOINING US NOW

628
00:17:23,375 --> 00:17:24,108
WHAT'S THE WEATHER LIKE WHERE 

629
00:17:24,108 --> 00:17:25,611
YOU ARE RIGHT NOW? 

630
00:17:25,611 --> 00:17:26,810
IT'S HARD TO TELL. 

631
00:17:26,810 --> 00:17:28,146
BUT IT LOOKS SO FAR CALM. 

632
00:17:28,146 --> 00:17:31,483
BUT WE KNOW THAT FLORENCE IS 

633
00:17:31,483 --> 00:17:33,084
APPROACHING THE COAST. 

634
00:17:33,084 --> 00:17:33,751
>> Reporter: THAT'S RIGHT VLAD. 

635
00:17:33,751 --> 00:17:36,722
AS YOU CAN TELL FROM THE 

636
00:17:36,722 --> 00:17:37,723
PICTURES HERE, IT IS CALM. 

637
00:17:37,723 --> 00:17:38,891
IT'S STILL RELATIVELY MILD AND 

638
00:17:38,891 --> 00:17:39,825
YOU KNOW WE'VE NOTICED 

639
00:17:39,825 --> 00:17:41,593
CONDITIONS STARTING TO TURN A 

640
00:17:41,593 --> 00:17:43,529
LITTLE BIT HERE IN THE LAST 

641
00:17:43,529 --> 00:17:44,029
FIVE, SIX HOURS. 

642
00:17:44,029 --> 00:17:46,365
WIND GUSTS STARTING TO PICK UP 

643
00:17:46,365 --> 00:17:46,765
HERE AND THERE. 

644
00:17:46,765 --> 00:17:49,168
THE SUN HAS COME OUT ONCE OR 

645
00:17:49,168 --> 00:17:49,401
TWICE. 

646
00:17:49,401 --> 00:17:51,503
BUT AS YOU MENTIONED, ABOUT 24 

647
00:17:51,503 --> 00:17:53,538
HOURS FROM NOW, WE ARE 

648
00:17:53,538 --> 00:17:55,574
EXPECTING TO REALLY BE IN FULL 

649
00:17:55,574 --> 00:17:56,541
SWING HERE AS FLORENCE IS 

650
00:17:56,541 --> 00:17:57,508
EXPECTED TO MAKE LANDFALL. 

651
00:17:57,508 --> 00:17:58,277
>> WHAT ARE OFFICIALS SAYING 

652
00:17:58,277 --> 00:17:59,945
ABOUT THE RISKS OF TRYING TO 

653
00:17:59,945 --> 00:18:00,412
RIDE OUT THE STORM? 

654
00:18:00,412 --> 00:18:03,315
WE'VE SEEN YOU KNOW A HANDFUL 

655
00:18:03,315 --> 00:18:04,783
OF PEOPLE WHO SAY THAT'S 

656
00:18:04,783 --> 00:18:07,218
EXACTLY WHAT THEY INTEND TO DO. 

657
00:18:07,218 --> 00:18:08,353
>> Reporter: YEAH, OVERWHELMING 

658
00:18:08,353 --> 00:18:09,887
MAJORITY OF PEOPLE ALONG THE 

659
00:18:09,887 --> 00:18:11,056
COASTLINE UP AND DOWN 

660
00:18:11,056 --> 00:18:12,624
THROUGHOUT NORTH AND SOUTH 

661
00:18:12,624 --> 00:18:14,860
CAROLINA ESPECIALLY IN THE 

662
00:18:14,860 --> 00:18:15,493
VULNERABLE COASTAL COMMUNITES, 

663
00:18:15,493 --> 00:18:16,161
THE OVERWHELMING MAJORITY F 

664
00:18:16,161 --> 00:18:18,463
PEOPLE HEEDED THE WARNINGS AND 

665
00:18:18,463 --> 00:18:19,297
THEY HEEDED THE ADVICE. 

666
00:18:19,297 --> 00:18:21,266
AND THE MANDATORY EVACUATIONS 

667
00:18:21,266 --> 00:18:22,668
AND EVEN THE VOLUNTARY 

668
00:18:22,668 --> 00:18:23,001
EVACUATIONS. 

669
00:18:23,001 --> 00:18:23,535
AND THEY HEADED INLAND. 

670
00:18:23,535 --> 00:18:24,803
THEY MOVED WEST AND THEY GOT 

671
00:18:24,803 --> 00:18:26,071
OUT OF TOWN. 

672
00:18:26,071 --> 00:18:28,640
YOU ARE ALWAYS GOING TO HAVE A 

673
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:30,375
HANDFUL OF PEOPLE WHO WANT TO 

674
00:18:30,375 --> 00:18:31,176
RIDE THE STORM OUT AND 

675
00:18:31,176 --> 00:18:32,611
ACCORDING TO THOSE PEOPLE YOU 

676
00:18:32,611 --> 00:18:34,146
KNOW, WE'VE FOUND A COUPLE AND 

677
00:18:34,146 --> 00:18:35,113
SPOKE TO A COUPLE. 

678
00:18:35,113 --> 00:18:36,682
IT'S NOT -- YOU KNOW, BECAUSE 

679
00:18:36,682 --> 00:18:38,550
THEY'RE BEING NAIVE ABOUT THIS. 

680
00:18:38,550 --> 00:18:40,252
OR THEY'RE BEING IGNORANT OR TO 

681
00:18:40,252 --> 00:18:42,588
THE STORM OR YOU KNOW, SEEKING 

682
00:18:42,588 --> 00:18:43,788
OUT SOME YOU KNOW, TWISTED 

683
00:18:43,788 --> 00:18:44,723
SENSE OF ADVENTURE OR ANYTHING 

684
00:18:44,723 --> 00:18:45,023
LIKE THAT. 

685
00:18:45,023 --> 00:18:46,358
BUT THEY WANT TO BE CLOSE TO 

686
00:18:46,358 --> 00:18:47,092
THEIR PROPERTIES. 

687
00:18:47,092 --> 00:18:48,227
THEY DON'T WANT DO ABANDON WHAT 

688
00:18:48,227 --> 00:18:48,560
THEY OWN. 

689
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:49,861
THEY WANT TO PUT EYES ON THE 

690
00:18:49,861 --> 00:18:50,095
DAMAGE. 

691
00:18:50,095 --> 00:18:52,898
THEY WANT TO BE FIRST ONES TO 

692
00:18:52,898 --> 00:18:55,534
RESPOND TO THE DAMAGE OF THEIR 

693
00:18:55,534 --> 00:18:55,834
PROPERTIES. 

694
00:18:55,834 --> 00:18:56,702
BUT AGAIN, OFFICIALS ARE NOT 

695
00:18:56,702 --> 00:18:58,971
MINUTING ANY WORDS ABOUT -- 

696
00:18:58,971 --> 00:18:59,638
MINCING ANY WORDS ABOUT THIS. 

697
00:18:59,638 --> 00:19:01,073
WE HEARD EVERYTHING OVER THE 

698
00:19:01,073 --> 00:19:03,008
LAST COUPLE OF DAYS FROM THIS 

699
00:19:03,008 --> 00:19:07,079
IS A MONSTER OF A STORM TO A 

700
00:19:07,079 --> 00:19:08,280
CATASTROPHIC POTENTIAL STORM. 

701
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:08,747
THE POLICE CHIEF OF 

702
00:19:08,747 --> 00:19:10,148
WRIGHTSVILLE BEACH WAS OUT HERE 

703
00:19:10,148 --> 00:19:11,650
A FEW MINUTES AGO. 

704
00:19:11,650 --> 00:19:14,119
AND WHEN HE WAS ASKED WHAT HE 

705
00:19:14,119 --> 00:19:15,187
WAS -- WHAT HIS OFFICERS ARE 

706
00:19:15,187 --> 00:19:17,322
TELLING THE FOLKS WHO DECIDED 

707
00:19:17,322 --> 00:19:17,989
TO STAY BEHIND. 

708
00:19:17,989 --> 00:19:20,592
IS THAT THEY WERE GETTING NEXT 

709
00:19:20,592 --> 00:19:21,226
OF KIN NAMES. 

710
00:19:21,226 --> 00:19:22,995
TO NOTIFY THEIR NEXT OF KIN IN 

711
00:19:22,995 --> 00:19:24,396
THE EVENT OF THEIR DEATHS. 

712
00:19:24,396 --> 00:19:25,530
SO THESE FOLKS ARE NOT IN TERMS 

713
00:19:25,530 --> 00:19:26,698
OF THE OFFICIALS THEY ARE NOT 

714
00:19:26,698 --> 00:19:29,201
MINCING ANY WORDS AND THAT'S BY 

715
00:19:29,201 --> 00:19:29,434
DESIGN. 

716
00:19:29,434 --> 00:19:30,836
THEY WANT TO SCARE PEOPLE INTO 

717
00:19:30,836 --> 00:19:31,069
MOVING. 

718
00:19:31,069 --> 00:19:32,771
THEY'D RATHER SCARE THEM AND 

719
00:19:32,771 --> 00:19:34,939
HAVE THEM MOVE INLAND THAN HAVE 

720
00:19:34,939 --> 00:19:37,376
THEM AND THERE NOT BE A STORM 

721
00:19:37,376 --> 00:19:39,511
THAN HAVE THEM STICK AROUND AND 

722
00:19:39,511 --> 00:19:40,945
YOU KNOW, PERHAPS POTENTIALLY 

723
00:19:40,945 --> 00:19:41,379
SUFFER THE WORST. 

724
00:19:41,379 --> 00:19:43,081
>> I DON'T KNOW WHAT PEOPLE 

725
00:19:43,081 --> 00:19:43,982
THINK THEY'RE GOING TO DO TO 

726
00:19:43,982 --> 00:19:45,383
HAVE FIRST EYES ON THE DAMAGE. 

727
00:19:45,383 --> 00:19:46,852
YOU ARE NOT GOING TO BE ABLE TO 

728
00:19:46,852 --> 00:19:49,120
HOLD BACK A STORM SURGE OR A 

729
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:49,687
FLOOD IN YOUR HOUSE. 

730
00:19:49,687 --> 00:19:51,256
AND PEOPLE ARE NOT GOING TO BE 

731
00:19:51,256 --> 00:19:54,793
ABLE TO GET TO YOU TO HELP YOU 

732
00:19:54,793 --> 00:19:55,426
IF THAT HAPPENS. 

733
00:19:55,426 --> 00:19:55,860
>> Reporter: YEAH. 

734
00:19:55,860 --> 00:19:56,962
MAN IS NO MATCH FOR MOTHER 

735
00:19:56,962 --> 00:19:57,195
NATURE. 

736
00:19:57,195 --> 00:19:57,829
THERE'S NOTHING YOU CAN DO. 

737
00:19:57,829 --> 00:20:00,999
IT'S BETTER TO WAIT IT OUT. 

738
00:20:00,999 --> 00:20:03,534
THERE'S NO QUESTION ABOUT IT. 

739
00:20:03,534 --> 00:20:04,436
BUT THE RATIONALE THAT WE GET 

740
00:20:04,436 --> 00:20:05,971
FROM FOLKS IS THEY DON'T WANT 

741
00:20:05,971 --> 00:20:06,805
TO ABANDON THEIR PROPERTIES. 

742
00:20:06,805 --> 00:20:08,640
>> LET'S TALK ABOUT THE STORM 

743
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:09,207
SURGE. 

744
00:20:09,207 --> 00:20:10,609
I MEAN HAVE YOU SPOKEN TO 

745
00:20:10,609 --> 00:20:12,311
ANYBODY WHO HAS DECIDED THAT 

746
00:20:12,311 --> 00:20:15,180
THEY'RE GOING TO RIDE THIS OUT? 

747
00:20:15,180 --> 00:20:16,848
WHAT THEY WILL DO IF THAT STORM 

748
00:20:16,848 --> 00:20:20,118
SURGE HAPPENS OVER THE NEXT 

749
00:20:20,118 --> 00:20:20,518
COUPLE OF HOURS? 

750
00:20:20,518 --> 00:20:21,486
>> Reporter: WELL, AGAIN, THIS 

751
00:20:21,486 --> 00:20:24,990
GOES BACK TO WHAT WE WERE JUST 

752
00:20:24,990 --> 00:20:25,357
TALKING ABOUT. 

753
00:20:25,357 --> 00:20:26,024
THERE'S NEVER REALLY GOOD A EX-

754
00:20:26,024 --> 00:20:27,825
- REALLY A GOOD EXPLANATION, 

755
00:20:27,825 --> 00:20:29,027
THEY HAVE AN EXPLANATION AND 

756
00:20:29,027 --> 00:20:30,829
FOLKS THAT WE HAVE SPOKEN TO 

757
00:20:30,829 --> 00:20:31,463
WILL FIND HIGHER GROUND. 

758
00:20:31,463 --> 00:20:32,531
PERHAPS GOING UP ON TO THE ROOF 

759
00:20:32,531 --> 00:20:34,466
YOU KNOW WE'VE SEEN THOSE SORT 

760
00:20:34,466 --> 00:20:35,801
OF IMAGES WITH KATRINA AND WITH 

761
00:20:35,801 --> 00:20:36,835
HARVEY. 

762
00:20:36,835 --> 00:20:38,103
AND SOME OF THOSE OTHER STORMS. 

763
00:20:38,103 --> 00:20:38,770
WITH YOU KNOW PEOPLE GETTING TO 

764
00:20:38,770 --> 00:20:39,972
THE POINT WHERE THEY HAVE 

765
00:20:39,972 --> 00:20:40,738
NOWHERE ELSE TO GO. 

766
00:20:40,738 --> 00:20:42,541
THE WATER STARTS MOVING IN SO 

767
00:20:42,541 --> 00:20:43,242
QUICKLY THAT THEY'VE GOT YOU 

768
00:20:43,242 --> 00:20:45,310
KNOW, THEY GOT TO GO TO THE 

769
00:20:45,310 --> 00:20:45,677
ROOF. 

770
00:20:45,677 --> 00:20:46,745
SO IF THAT'S YOUR YOU KNOW IF 

771
00:20:46,745 --> 00:20:48,480
THAT'S YOUR PLAN, THEN THAT'S 

772
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:51,950
YOU KNOW, YOU MIGHT FIND 

773
00:20:51,950 --> 00:20:54,486
YOURSELF IN A LIFE-THREATENING 

774
00:20:54,486 --> 00:20:54,686
SPOT. 

775
00:20:54,686 --> 00:20:55,887
SO YOU KNOW, AS FAR AS WHAT 

776
00:20:55,887 --> 00:20:57,222
PEPLE CAN DO, THERE'S NOT A 

777
00:20:57,222 --> 00:20:58,523
WHOLE LOT YOU CAN DO ESPECIALLY 

778
00:20:58,523 --> 00:21:00,826
YOU KNOW THE SOME OF THE AREAS 

779
00:21:00,826 --> 00:21:02,560
THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT. 

780
00:21:02,560 --> 00:21:05,229
SOME OF THE WORST EXPECTED 

781
00:21:05,229 --> 00:21:06,030
STORM SURGE AREAS. 

782
00:21:06,030 --> 00:21:07,132
THERE'S TALKING ABOUT 

783
00:21:07,132 --> 00:21:08,567
POTENTIALLY 9, 10, 11 FEET OF 

784
00:21:08,567 --> 00:21:08,900
STORM SURGE. 

785
00:21:08,900 --> 00:21:10,235
NOW YOU CAN BOARD UP THE 

786
00:21:10,235 --> 00:21:11,803
PROPERTIES AND YOU CAN PUT 

787
00:21:11,803 --> 00:21:12,170
SANDBAGS DOWN. 

788
00:21:12,170 --> 00:21:14,305
YOU KNOW A LOT OF THESE COASTAL 

789
00:21:14,305 --> 00:21:15,006
COMMUNITIES AND BEACH 

790
00:21:15,006 --> 00:21:16,441
COMMUNITIES, YOU KNOW STATES 

791
00:21:16,441 --> 00:21:17,175
AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS HAVE DONE 

792
00:21:17,175 --> 00:21:19,511
A LOT IN THE LAST FEW YEARS TO 

793
00:21:19,511 --> 00:21:23,147
MITIGATE YOU KNOW A LOT OF 

794
00:21:23,147 --> 00:21:23,748
BEACH DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS TO 

795
00:21:23,748 --> 00:21:26,818
MITIGATE SOME OF THE STORMS BUT 

796
00:21:26,818 --> 00:21:27,652
A 10-FOOT STORM SURGE? 

797
00:21:27,652 --> 00:21:29,387
MAN IS NO MATCH FOR MOTHER 

798
00:21:29,387 --> 00:21:29,621
NATURE. 

799
00:21:29,621 --> 00:21:32,090
THERE'S NOT A LOT YOU CAN DO IN 

800
00:21:32,090 --> 00:21:33,358
TERMS OF PROTECTING YOURSELF. 

801
00:21:33,358 --> 00:21:34,426
>> ALL RIGHT MOLA LENGHI 

802
00:21:34,426 --> 00:21:36,395
REPORTING FOR US AT NORTH 

803
00:21:36,395 --> 00:21:36,828
CAROLINA. 

804
00:21:36,828 --> 00:21:39,331
THANK YOU SO MUCH. 

805
00:21:39,331 --> 00:21:40,165
WE APPRECIATE IT. 

806
00:21:40,165 --> 00:21:42,868
>>> ALL RIGHT LET'S TURN TO 

807
00:21:42,868 --> 00:21:43,969
ADRIANA DIAZ JOINING US LIVE 

808
00:21:43,969 --> 00:21:45,170
NOW. 

809
00:21:45,170 --> 00:21:48,740
>> WHAT EXACTLY IS YOUR  

810
00:21:48,740 --> 00:21:49,006
LOCATION? 

811
00:21:49,006 --> 00:21:49,908
>> Reporter: I'M IN 

812
00:21:49,908 --> 00:21:50,608
JACKSONVILLE, NORTH CAROLINA. 

813
00:21:50,608 --> 00:21:53,812
THIS IS THE NEW RIVER BEHIND ME 

814
00:21:53,812 --> 00:21:55,881
AND IT LEADS ABOUT 10 TO 20 

815
00:21:55,881 --> 00:21:59,451
MILES THIS WAY TO AN INLET THAT 

816
00:21:59,451 --> 00:22:00,117
LEADS TO THE ATLANTIC. 

817
00:22:00,117 --> 00:22:02,187
>> SO YOU KNOW, IT LOOKS LIKE 

818
00:22:02,187 --> 00:22:04,923
THE WATER IS ALREADY PRETTY 

819
00:22:04,923 --> 00:22:05,790
HIGH WHERE YOU ARE. 

820
00:22:05,790 --> 00:22:06,658
IS THE EXPECTATION THAT THIS 

821
00:22:06,658 --> 00:22:10,662
RIVER IS PROBABLY GOING TO 

822
00:22:10,662 --> 00:22:11,996
OVERFLOW ITS BANKS? 

823
00:22:11,996 --> 00:22:13,865
>> Reporter: ABSOLUTELY. 

824
00:22:13,865 --> 00:22:14,700
WHERE I'M STANDING THIS DOCK IS 

825
00:22:14,700 --> 00:22:15,533
GOING TO BE UNDERWATER. 

826
00:22:15,533 --> 00:22:16,968
GOING TO BE THE EARLIEST AREAS 

827
00:22:16,968 --> 00:22:18,703
ONE OF THE EARLIEST AREAS TO 

828
00:22:18,703 --> 00:22:18,936
FLOOD. 

829
00:22:18,936 --> 00:22:21,539
AND WE WENT OUT ON THE WATER 

830
00:22:21,539 --> 00:22:22,507
YESTERDAY WITH WILDLIFE 

831
00:22:22,507 --> 00:22:24,409
OFFICERS WHO WERE JUST LOOKING 

832
00:22:24,409 --> 00:22:26,311
FOR HAZARDS ON THE WATERWAYS. 

833
00:22:26,311 --> 00:22:27,879
AND THEY TOLD ME THAT EVEN 

834
00:22:27,879 --> 00:22:30,281
THOUGH THIS ISN'T THAT CHOPPY 

835
00:22:30,281 --> 00:22:33,051
YET AND YESTERDAY WAS EVEN LESS 

836
00:22:33,051 --> 00:22:33,284
CHOPPY. 

837
00:22:33,284 --> 00:22:36,722
THEY SAID NORMALLY THIS WATER 

838
00:22:36,722 --> 00:22:37,789
IS AS SMOOTH AS GLASS. 

839
00:22:37,789 --> 00:22:40,392
SO JUST IMAGINE THE DIFFERENCE 

840
00:22:40,392 --> 00:22:41,960
THAT IT IS AND WHAT'S HAD TO 

841
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:43,195
HAPPENED TO START CREATING THIS 

842
00:22:43,195 --> 00:22:43,462
MOVEMENT. 

843
00:22:43,462 --> 00:22:46,298
I MEAN, YOU CAN SEE THE WIND 

844
00:22:46,298 --> 00:22:46,598
RIGHT HERE. 

845
00:22:46,598 --> 00:22:47,766
THIS REALLY WASN'T MOVING MUCH 

846
00:22:47,766 --> 00:22:48,400
WHEN WE WERE HERE YESTERDAY. 

847
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:49,668
AND JUST IN THE PAST FEW HOURS, 

848
00:22:49,668 --> 00:22:51,803
THE WIND HAS REALLY STARTED TO 

849
00:22:51,803 --> 00:22:52,070
PICK UP. 

850
00:22:52,070 --> 00:22:52,670
IT'S BEEN DRIZZLING JUST A 

851
00:22:52,670 --> 00:22:55,006
LITTLE BIT THAT'S WHY I HAVE 

852
00:22:55,006 --> 00:22:57,075
THIS RAIN JACKET ON. 

853
00:22:57,075 --> 00:22:58,409
BUT THAT'S BEEN OFF AND ON. 

854
00:22:58,409 --> 00:23:00,912
BUT YOU CAN TELL THINGS ARE 

855
00:23:00,912 --> 00:23:01,946
STARTING TO CHANGE. 

856
00:23:01,946 --> 00:23:02,948
>> SO WE KNOW THAT THE 

857
00:23:02,948 --> 00:23:05,484
HURRICANE HAS BEEN WEAKENED TO 

858
00:23:05,484 --> 00:23:07,486
A CATEGORY 2. DOES THAT LESSEN 

859
00:23:07,486 --> 00:23:08,720
THE THREAT OF STORM SURGE FOR 

860
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:12,891
THE RIVER THAT IS BEHIND YOU 

861
00:23:12,891 --> 00:23:13,124
THERE? 

862
00:23:13,124 --> 00:23:14,392
>> Reporter: WELL, EVEN THOUGH 

863
00:23:14,392 --> 00:23:15,993
IT'S LESSENED TO A CATEGORY 2, 

864
00:23:15,993 --> 00:23:18,263
SO THOSE ARE STILL SUSTAINED 

865
00:23:18,263 --> 00:23:19,865
WINDS OF ABOUT 110 MILES PER 

866
00:23:19,865 --> 00:23:21,299
HOUR, THE PROBLEM WITH THIS 

867
00:23:21,299 --> 00:23:24,102
STORM IS THAT THE WIND FIELD 

868
00:23:24,102 --> 00:23:24,569
HAS ACTUALLY WIDENED. 

869
00:23:24,569 --> 00:23:26,238
SO OFFICIALS BELIEVE THAT WILL 

870
00:23:26,238 --> 00:23:28,740
MAKE STORM SURGE WORSE THAN IT 

871
00:23:28,740 --> 00:23:29,841
WAS BEFORE. 

872
00:23:29,841 --> 00:23:30,475
SO THEY'RE EXPECTING UP TO 13 

873
00:23:30,475 --> 00:23:33,445
FEET IN SOME PARTS OF THE 

874
00:23:33,445 --> 00:23:33,912
REGION. 

875
00:23:33,912 --> 00:23:35,279
AND THAT IS MAYBE EVEN WORSE BY 

876
00:23:35,279 --> 00:23:37,949
THE MORE THAN 20 INCHES OF RAIN 

877
00:23:37,949 --> 00:23:38,416
THAT'S ALSO EXPECTED. 

878
00:23:38,416 --> 00:23:41,486
>> SO WHAT ABOUT -- YOU TALKED 

879
00:23:41,486 --> 00:23:42,988
TO PEOPLE -- FROM WHAT WE SEE 

880
00:23:42,988 --> 00:23:43,788
RIGHT IS THERE BUT ARE THERE 

881
00:23:43,788 --> 00:23:45,357
HOMES IN THE AREA AND THE 

882
00:23:45,357 --> 00:23:47,759
RESIDENTS THAT LIVE IN THAT 

883
00:23:47,759 --> 00:23:50,161
AREA, HAVE THEY BEEN TOLD TO 

884
00:23:50,161 --> 00:23:51,363
LEAVE OR WHAT'S THEIR 

885
00:23:51,363 --> 00:23:51,663
SITUATION? 

886
00:23:51,663 --> 00:23:52,130
>> Reporter: RIGHT. 

887
00:23:52,130 --> 00:23:56,535
SO WE'RE IN ONS LOW COUNTY. 

888
00:23:56,535 --> 00:23:57,502
A -- ONSLOW COUNTY. 

889
00:23:57,502 --> 00:23:58,136
THERE'S A MANDATORY EVACUATION. 

890
00:23:58,136 --> 00:23:58,737
WOE SAW PEOPLE STILL OUTSIDE 

891
00:23:58,737 --> 00:24:01,172
THE HOMES AND SOME PEOPLE ARE 

892
00:24:01,172 --> 00:24:01,505
BOARDING UP. 

893
00:24:01,505 --> 00:24:03,174
BUT OTHERS LOOK LIKE THEY PLAN 

894
00:24:03,174 --> 00:24:03,541
TO STAY. 

895
00:24:03,541 --> 00:24:05,176
WE SPOKE TO SOMEONE WHO WAS 

896
00:24:05,176 --> 00:24:06,278
ACTUALLY WORKING ON HIS 

897
00:24:06,278 --> 00:24:07,779
SAILBOAT AND GETTING THE SAIL 

898
00:24:07,779 --> 00:24:09,180
DOWN TO TRY TO MINIMIZE 

899
00:24:09,180 --> 00:24:10,682
MOVEMENT WHEN THE STORM DOES 

900
00:24:10,682 --> 00:24:10,915
COME. 

901
00:24:10,915 --> 00:24:12,083
THAT SAILBOAT IS ANCHORED AWAY 

902
00:24:12,083 --> 00:24:14,252
FROM HOMES AND THAT PERSON TOLD 

903
00:24:14,252 --> 00:24:15,787
US THAT THEY PLAN TO STAY. 

904
00:24:15,787 --> 00:24:18,156
HE SAID YOU KNOW, I HATE TO SAY 

905
00:24:18,156 --> 00:24:19,357
THAT THE NEWS MEDIA CRIES OF 

906
00:24:19,357 --> 00:24:21,025
OF, BUT HE CITIZEN -- WOLF. 

907
00:24:21,025 --> 00:24:21,693
BUT HE HAS SAYS IN HIS 

908
00:24:21,693 --> 00:24:22,727
EXPERIENCE EVERY STORM IS THE 

909
00:24:22,727 --> 00:24:24,162
BIGGEST STORM AND THEN THE 

910
00:24:24,162 --> 00:24:25,664
STORM COMES AND GOES AND IT'S 

911
00:24:25,664 --> 00:24:26,431
NOT THE BIGGEST STORM. 

912
00:24:26,431 --> 00:24:27,499
HE'S HEDGING HIS BETS AND 

913
00:24:27,499 --> 00:24:28,733
ROLLING THE DICE AND HE'S 

914
00:24:28,733 --> 00:24:29,066
STAYING HOME. 

915
00:24:29,066 --> 00:24:29,667
I SAID WELL OFFICIALS SAY YOU 

916
00:24:29,667 --> 00:24:32,337
HAVE TO GET OUT OF HERE. 

917
00:24:32,337 --> 00:24:33,138
HE SAID WELL, I'M TAKING 

918
00:24:33,138 --> 00:24:34,172
RESPONSIBILITY FOR MYSELF AND 

919
00:24:34,172 --> 00:24:34,806
MY FAMILY. 

920
00:24:34,806 --> 00:24:36,141
AND HE SAID THAT STORM IS 

921
00:24:36,141 --> 00:24:37,042
MOVING RELATIVELY SLOWLY AND I 

922
00:24:37,042 --> 00:24:39,344
THINK I'LL BE ABLE TO OUTRUN IT 

923
00:24:39,344 --> 00:24:42,080
IN MY CAR IF IT COMES TO THE 

924
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:43,081
POINT WHERE IT LOOKS LIKE IT'S 

925
00:24:43,081 --> 00:24:44,049
COMING THIS WAY AND THEY HAVE 

926
00:24:44,049 --> 00:24:45,850
TO STILL GET OUT OF DODGE. 

927
00:24:45,850 --> 00:24:47,018
THAT'S WHAT ONE PERSON TOLD US 

928
00:24:47,018 --> 00:24:49,588
AND WE'VE FOUND SEVERAL PEOPLE 

929
00:24:49,588 --> 00:24:49,988
WHO ARE STAYING. 

930
00:24:49,988 --> 00:24:51,623
SOME PEOPLE WANT TO KEEP AN EYE 

931
00:24:51,623 --> 00:24:54,125
ON THE PROPERTIES AND NOT TOO 

932
00:24:54,125 --> 00:24:55,560
FAR FROM THE BOATS. 

933
00:24:55,560 --> 00:24:57,529
SOME PEOPLE DON'T THINK IT'S 

934
00:24:57,529 --> 00:24:58,096
GOING TO THAT BAD. 

935
00:24:58,096 --> 00:24:59,263
WHATEVER THE REASON OFFICIALS 

936
00:24:59,263 --> 00:24:59,597
DON'T AGREE. 

937
00:24:59,597 --> 00:25:00,532
THEY WANT EVERYBODY OUT OF HERE 

938
00:25:00,532 --> 00:25:01,633
BUT THAT'S NOT THE CASE. 

939
00:25:01,633 --> 00:25:02,867
>> I DON'T GET PEOPLE. 

940
00:25:02,867 --> 00:25:04,369
WHAT'S TAKING A COUPLE OF DAYS 

941
00:25:04,369 --> 00:25:05,503
OFF AND GETTING OUT OF TOWN? 

942
00:25:05,503 --> 00:25:07,838
I MEAN, I KNOW IT'S A BIT OF A 

943
00:25:07,838 --> 00:25:08,673
HASSLE. 

944
00:25:08,673 --> 00:25:08,906
BUT -- 

945
00:25:08,906 --> 00:25:10,208
>> YEAH ESPECIALLY IF YOU HAVE 

946
00:25:10,208 --> 00:25:10,742
CHILDREN. 

947
00:25:10,742 --> 00:25:12,711
I MEAN, YOU KNOW ALSO YOU ARE 

948
00:25:12,711 --> 00:25:14,545
IN AN AREA -- SORRY GO AHEAD. 

949
00:25:14,545 --> 00:25:15,880
>> Reporter: WELL -- I WAS JUST 

950
00:25:15,880 --> 00:25:17,549
GOING TO SAY THAT THE GENTLEMAN 

951
00:25:17,549 --> 00:25:18,383
I SPOKE TO SAID YOU KNOW, IT'S 

952
00:25:18,383 --> 00:25:19,584
NOT JUST A COUPLE OF DAYS. 

953
00:25:19,584 --> 00:25:20,518
YOU GET OUT OF TOWN AND YOU MAY 

954
00:25:20,518 --> 00:25:24,355
NOT BE ABLE TO COME BACK FOR 

955
00:25:24,355 --> 00:25:24,856
WEEKS. 

956
00:25:24,856 --> 00:25:26,524
WIDESPREAD POWER OUTAGES ARE 

957
00:25:26,524 --> 00:25:26,891
ALSO EXPECTED. 

958
00:25:26,891 --> 00:25:29,628
THREE MILLION HOMES AND 

959
00:25:29,628 --> 00:25:30,861
BUSINESSES MAY BE WITHOUT 

960
00:25:30,861 --> 00:25:31,095
POWER. 

961
00:25:31,095 --> 00:25:32,230
SO NOT THAT STAYING HOME WILL 

962
00:25:32,230 --> 00:25:35,533
AFFECT THE FACT THAT YOU MAY 

963
00:25:35,533 --> 00:25:36,667
LOSE POWER. 

964
00:25:36,667 --> 00:25:39,103
BUT LEAVING FOR SOME PEOPLE. 

965
00:25:39,103 --> 00:25:39,971
THEY THINK THAT IT MIGHT EXTEND 

966
00:25:39,971 --> 00:25:41,306
THE AMOUNT OF TIME IT WILL TAKE 

967
00:25:41,306 --> 00:25:42,440
THEM TO GET BACK. 

968
00:25:42,440 --> 00:25:52,517
>> ALSO IN AN AREA THAT HAS A 

969
00:25:52,517 --> 00:26:01,793
NUMBER OF MILITARY BASES.

970
00:26:01,793 --> 00:26:05,063
>> Reporter: THEY DID NOT 

971
00:26:05,063 --> 00:26:05,930
REQUIRE A MANDATORY EVACUATION. 

972
00:26:05,930 --> 00:26:07,832
THOUGH MANY, MANY MARINES DID 

973
00:26:07,832 --> 00:26:08,466
LEAVE. 

974
00:26:08,466 --> 00:26:09,234
WE SPOKE TO ONE MILITARY WIFE 

975
00:26:09,234 --> 00:26:11,369
WHO IS PROBABLY RIGHT NOW ON 

976
00:26:11,369 --> 00:26:12,237
THE ROAD MAKING HER WAY TO 

977
00:26:12,237 --> 00:26:16,341
BOSTON FROM ALL THE WAY DOWN IN 

978
00:26:16,341 --> 00:26:16,708
NORTH CAROLINA. 

979
00:26:16,708 --> 00:26:17,275
BUT OTHERS ARE STAYING. 

980
00:26:17,275 --> 00:26:18,877
MY COLLEAGUE MARK COOPER SPOKE 

981
00:26:18,877 --> 00:26:21,112
TO A GENTLEMAN WHO IS STAYING. 

982
00:26:21,112 --> 00:26:24,249
HE SAYS HE'S NOT TOO CONCERNED. 

983
00:26:24,249 --> 00:26:26,051
THE HEAD OF CAMP LEJEUNE SAID 

984
00:26:26,051 --> 00:26:27,685
THAT THEY ARE PREPARED. 

985
00:26:27,685 --> 00:26:28,887
THEY HAVE FOOD. 

986
00:26:28,887 --> 00:26:29,654
THEY HAVE PREPARATIONS. 

987
00:26:29,654 --> 00:26:30,655
THEY WILL BE ABLE TO PROTECT 

988
00:26:30,655 --> 00:26:32,157
THE SERVICEMEN AND WOMEN WHO 

989
00:26:32,157 --> 00:26:33,591
ARE GOING TO STAY THERE. 

990
00:26:33,591 --> 00:26:35,393
SO THAT IS OF COURSE A CONCERN 

991
00:26:35,393 --> 00:26:38,096
AND IN VIRGINIA, THEY ALSO HAVE 

992
00:26:38,096 --> 00:26:39,030
TO DEAL WITH ENORMOUS NAVY 

993
00:26:39,030 --> 00:26:39,364
SHIPS. 

994
00:26:39,364 --> 00:26:42,867
AND SO WHAT THEY DID A FEW DAYS 

995
00:26:42,867 --> 00:26:43,467
AGO WAS ACTUALLY MOVED THOSE 

996
00:26:43,467 --> 00:26:44,803
OUT TO THE ATLANTIC WHERE 

997
00:26:44,803 --> 00:26:45,437
THEY'RE GOING TO BE CIPHER FROM 

998
00:26:45,437 --> 00:26:48,039
THE STORM -- SAFER FROM THE 

999
00:26:48,039 --> 00:26:55,446
STORM THAN IN THE PORTS. 

1000
00:26:55,446 --> 00:26:56,815
>> ALL RIGHT. 

1001
00:26:56,815 --> 00:26:57,681
>> THANK YOU ADRIANA. 

1002
00:26:57,681 --> 00:26:58,249
>>> AS EXPECTED HURRICANE 

1003
00:26:58,249 --> 00:27:00,518
FLORENCE IS ALSO CAUSING MAJOR 

1004
00:27:00,518 --> 00:27:02,387
ISSUES FOR TRAVELERS ALONG THE 

1005
00:27:02,387 --> 00:27:03,020
EAST COAST. 

1006
00:27:03,020 --> 00:27:04,155
ACCORDING TO FLIGHT AWARE, MORE 

1007
00:27:04,155 --> 00:27:06,224
THAN 800 FLIGHTS HAVE BEEN 

1008
00:27:06,224 --> 00:27:06,724
CANCELED SO FAR TODAY. 

1009
00:27:06,724 --> 00:27:08,560
AND NEARLY 600 HAVE BEEN 

1010
00:27:08,560 --> 00:27:09,260
DELAYED AS THE DAY GOES ON, 

1011
00:27:09,260 --> 00:27:11,196
THAT NUMBER OF COURSE IS 

1012
00:27:11,196 --> 00:27:11,963
EXPECTED TO GROW. 

1013
00:27:11,963 --> 00:27:13,631
>> SOME AIRLINES HAVE REDUCED 

1014
00:27:13,631 --> 00:27:15,366
FARES AND ELIMINATED SOME FEES 

1015
00:27:15,366 --> 00:27:16,567
FOR LAST-MINUTE TRAVELERS 

1016
00:27:16,567 --> 00:27:18,737
TRYING TO EVACUATE AREAS 

1017
00:27:18,737 --> 00:27:19,637
IMPACTED BY FLORENCE. 

1018
00:27:19,637 --> 00:27:22,440

QUICK BREAK. 

1025
00:27:30,948 --> 00:27:32,016
A REMINDER THAT IN ABOUT 15

RICO WILL RESPOND TO PRESIDENT

TRUMP AFTER HE SAID 3,000
