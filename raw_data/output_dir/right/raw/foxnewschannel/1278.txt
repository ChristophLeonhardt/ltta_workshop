1
00:00:01,404 --> 00:00:03,006
CALLED THE JAILHOUSE ROCKERS, AS

2
00:00:03,006 --> 00:00:04,841
EVER WITH THIS MAN, YOU CANNOT

3
00:00:04,841 --> 00:00:06,443
MAKE THIS STUFF UP, MARTHA.

4
00:00:06,443 --> 00:00:07,444
>> Martha: THANK YOU VERY MUCH

5
00:00:07,444 --> 00:00:10,413
PRAYED HERE NOW FOR AN EXCLUSIVE

6
00:00:10,413 --> 00:00:13,550
INTERVIEW ON THE STORY, PATRICIA

7
00:00:13,550 --> 00:00:14,518
BLAGOJEVICH, HIS WIFE, GOOD TO

8
00:00:14,518 --> 00:00:15,252
SEE YOU TONIGHT PRAYED I KNOW

9
00:00:15,252 --> 00:00:16,987
YOU SPOKE WITH YOUR HUSBAND

10
00:00:16,987 --> 00:00:18,455
TODAY FROM HIS PRISON, WHAT DID

11
00:00:18,455 --> 00:00:21,758
HE SAY WHEN HE HEARD THIS NEWS?

12
00:00:21,758 --> 00:00:24,961
>> YOU KNOW, HE WAS, AND WE ARE

13
00:00:24,961 --> 00:00:25,729
ALSO GRATEFUL THAT THE PRESIDENT

14
00:00:25,729 --> 00:00:28,198
IS THINKING OF US IN THIS WAY.

15
00:00:28,198 --> 00:00:30,300
BUT IT HAS BEEN SUCH A LONG ROAD

16
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:30,634
FOR US.

17
00:00:30,634 --> 00:00:33,904
WE HAVE BEEN SO DISAPPOINTED SO

18
00:00:34,037 --> 00:00:36,773
TWICE, AND BY THE PRESIDENT OF

19
00:00:36,773 --> 00:00:37,574
OUR OWN PARTY WE WERE

20
00:00:37,574 --> 00:00:40,377
DISAPPOINTED BY HIM.

21
00:00:40,377 --> 00:00:43,580
SO IT IS HARD TO EVEN HOPE THAT

22
00:00:43,580 --> 00:00:45,382
OUR DEAL MIGHT BE ENDING SOON.

23
00:00:45,382 --> 00:00:47,083
WE KNOW THAT PRESIDENT TRUMP IS

24
00:00:47,083 --> 00:00:49,219
A KIND MAN, HE IS COMPASSIONATE.

25
00:00:49,219 --> 00:00:52,022
HE HAS ALWAYS MEANT FIND KIND TO

26
00:00:52,022 --> 00:00:53,523
MY FAMILY PRAYED HE KNOWS HOW

27
00:00:53,523 --> 00:00:55,492
IMPORTANT IT IS TO GET TO MY

28
00:00:55,492 --> 00:00:57,160
HUSBAND HOME TO BE A FATHER TO

29
00:00:57,160 --> 00:00:58,695
HER DAUGHTER'S PRAYED WE CANNOT

30
00:00:58,695 --> 00:01:00,130
HELP BUT BE HOPEFUL.

31
00:01:00,130 --> 00:01:01,598
>> Martha: YOUR LITTLE GIRLS

32
00:01:01,598 --> 00:01:03,500
WERE YOUNGER AS KIDS ARE, NOW

33
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:05,635
SEVEN YEARS OLDER.

34
00:01:05,635 --> 00:01:08,371
AND 20 AND 13, RIGHT?

35
00:01:08,371 --> 00:01:11,207
>> MY OLDER DAUGHTER IS GOOD TO

36
00:01:11,207 --> 00:01:13,209
BE GRADUATING FROM COLLEGE THIS

37
00:01:13,209 --> 00:01:16,580
MONTH.

38
00:01:16,580 --> 00:01:18,181
MY OTHER ONE IS 15.

39
00:01:18,181 --> 00:01:20,283
>> Martha: YOU WONDER WHY THE

40
00:01:20,283 --> 00:01:21,284
PRESIDENT HAS BECOME INTERESTED

41
00:01:21,284 --> 00:01:23,320
IN THIS CASE NOW.

42
00:01:23,320 --> 00:01:25,555
YOU THINK ABOUT HIM BEING TAKEN

43
00:01:25,555 --> 00:01:30,360
OUT IN HANDCUFFS, THE

44
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:31,595
INVOLVEMENT OF COMEY AS WELL, IS

45
00:01:31,595 --> 00:01:32,696
HE SENSITIVE TO THE SITUATION

46
00:01:32,696 --> 00:01:34,698
BECAUSE OF WHAT HE IS GOING

47
00:01:34,698 --> 00:01:35,765
THROUGH.

48
00:01:35,765 --> 00:01:38,301
>> I SEE THAT, I SEE THAT, THE

49
00:01:38,301 --> 00:01:40,770
SAME PEOPLE THAT DID THIS TO MY

50
00:01:40,770 --> 00:01:42,105
FAMILY, THE SAME PEOPLE THAT

51
00:01:42,105 --> 00:01:45,675
SECRETLY TAPED US AND TWISTED

52
00:01:45,675 --> 00:01:47,043
THE FACTS AND PERVERTED THE LAW

53
00:01:47,043 --> 00:01:49,346
THAT ENDED UP MY HUSBAND IN JAIL

54
00:01:49,346 --> 00:01:49,846
THAT ENDED UP MY HUSBAND IN JAI

55
00:01:49,846 --> 00:01:52,582
JAIL.

56
00:01:52,582 --> 00:01:53,650
THE SAME PEOPLE ARE TRYING TO DO

57
00:01:53,650 --> 00:01:55,685
THE SAME THING THAT THEY DID TO

58
00:01:55,685 --> 00:01:57,988
MY HUSBAND ON A LARGER SCALE.

59
00:01:57,988 --> 00:01:59,189
THEY WERE EMBOLDENED.

60
00:01:59,189 --> 00:02:01,391
THEY TOOK ON THE GOVERNOR, AND

61
00:02:01,391 --> 00:02:03,760
NOW THEY HAVE IT MUCH HIGHER.

62
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:04,995
>> Martha: WE HAVE PLAYED A

63
00:02:04,995 --> 00:02:05,895
RECORDING THAT WAS SO FAMOUS,

64
00:02:05,895 --> 00:02:07,564
I'M SURE THAT YOU HAVE HEARD IT

65
00:02:07,564 --> 00:02:09,032
MORE THAN YOU WANT TO.

66
00:02:09,032 --> 00:02:10,567
BUT PEOPLE LISTEN TO THAT AND

67
00:02:10,567 --> 00:02:12,902
THEY SAY, LOOK, HE WAS TRYING TO

68
00:02:12,902 --> 00:02:14,804
SELL THE SENATE SEAT,

69
00:02:14,804 --> 00:02:16,006
PRESIDENT OBAMA WAS ELECTED, HE

70
00:02:16,006 --> 00:02:19,609
HAD A SEAT AS GOVERNOR WHO HE

71
00:02:19,609 --> 00:02:20,443
COULD APPOINT TO WHOEVER HE

72
00:02:20,443 --> 00:02:21,177
WANTED PRAYED I'M NOT GOING TO

73
00:02:21,177 --> 00:02:22,345
GIVE IT AWAY, I WANT SOMETHING

74
00:02:22,345 --> 00:02:22,779
FOR IT.

75
00:02:22,779 --> 00:02:24,648
AND THEY SAY, HIS CRITICS SAY

76
00:02:24,648 --> 00:02:26,416
THAT IS PRETTY CLEAR.

77
00:02:26,416 --> 00:02:27,984
THE JUDGE SEEMED TO AGREE WHEN

78
00:02:27,984 --> 00:02:28,985
HE PASSED UP ON THE OPPORTUNITY

79
00:02:28,985 --> 00:02:31,955
TO LET THEM GO IN 2016.

80
00:02:31,955 --> 00:02:33,423
>> I'M GLAD THAT YOU ASKED ME

81
00:02:33,423 --> 00:02:34,858
ABOUT THAT, BECAUSE YOU KNOW,

82
00:02:34,858 --> 00:02:38,995
THE INTERESTING IS THAT THERE

83
00:02:38,995 --> 00:02:39,696
WERE 70 DIFFERENT AUDIOTAPES

84
00:02:39,696 --> 00:02:41,064
THAT WE WANTED TO PLAY

85
00:02:41,064 --> 00:02:42,399
AT TRIAL BUT WERE SUPPRESSED BY

86
00:02:42,399 --> 00:02:42,999
THE GOVERNMENT.

87
00:02:42,999 --> 00:02:45,201
IF YOU HEARD EXACTLY WHAT HE

88
00:02:45,201 --> 00:02:47,003
WANTED FOR IT, IT WOULD BE A

89
00:02:47,003 --> 00:02:48,972
TOTALLY DIFFERENT STORY.

90
00:02:48,972 --> 00:02:49,806
ALL OF THESE CONVERSATIONS MY

91
00:02:49,806 --> 00:02:52,409
HUSBAND HAD WITH THE STAFF ABOUT

92
00:02:52,409 --> 00:02:54,177
WANTING TO GET A ROSE BILL

93
00:02:54,177 --> 00:02:56,012
PASSED IN ILLINOIS TO PUT MORE

94
00:02:56,012 --> 00:02:58,014
PEOPLE TO WORK OR HEALTH CARE

95
00:02:58,014 --> 00:02:59,616
FOR FAMILIES IN ILLINOIS, ALL OF

96
00:02:59,616 --> 00:03:01,284
THESE THINGS THAT HE HAD LINED

97
00:03:01,284 --> 00:03:03,753
UP THAT HE HAD WANTED FOR THE

98
00:03:03,753 --> 00:03:06,589
SENATE SEAT, NOBODY EVER HEARD.

99
00:03:06,589 --> 00:03:08,658
IT IS FRUSTRATING WHEN PEOPLE

100
00:03:08,658 --> 00:03:09,025
HEAR THAT.

101
00:03:09,025 --> 00:03:10,760
THIS WHOLE SELLING OF THE SENATE

102
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:12,762
SEAT, THOSE CHARGES WERE THROWN

103
00:03:12,762 --> 00:03:14,564
OUT BY THE COURTS OVER FIVE

104
00:03:14,564 --> 00:03:14,964
YEARS AGO.

105
00:03:14,964 --> 00:03:17,033
THAT CENTERPIECE OF THE CASE WAS

106
00:03:17,033 --> 00:03:20,036
DISMISSED AS POLITICAL BALL

107
00:03:20,036 --> 00:03:20,570
ROLLING.

108
00:03:20,570 --> 00:03:22,372
I WILL MAKE YOU APPOINTMENT IF

109
00:03:22,372 --> 00:03:24,908
YOU APPOINT ME TO THIS, THAT

110
00:03:24,908 --> 00:03:26,776
SEEMED PERFECTLY LEGAL POLITICS.

111
00:03:26,776 --> 00:03:27,677
>> Martha: I LISTEN TO A LOT

112
00:03:27,677 --> 00:03:32,315
OF THE TAPES, THE     THE DASH A

113
00:03:32,315 --> 00:03:32,348
OF THE TAPES, THE     THE DASH L

114
00:03:32,348 --> 00:03:32,449
OF THE TAPES, THE     THE DASH T

115
00:03:32,449 --> 00:03:32,482
OF THE TAPES, THE     THE DASH O

116
00:03:32,482 --> 00:03:33,183
OF THE TAPES, THE     THE DASH F

117
00:03:33,183 --> 00:03:34,050
THE THINGS WERE ABSOLUTELY MENTI

118
00:03:34,050 --> 00:03:34,084
THE THINGS WERE ABSOLUTELY MENTN

119
00:03:34,084 --> 00:03:34,150
THE THINGS WERE ABSOLUTELY MENTD

120
00:03:34,150 --> 00:03:34,184
THE THINGS WERE ABSOLUTELY MENTI

121
00:03:34,184 --> 00:03:34,484
THE THINGS WERE ABSOLUTELY MENTN

122
00:03:34,484 --> 00:03:35,952
THAT TAPE, AS FAR AS A

123
00:03:35,952 --> 00:03:38,054
PUNISHMENT FITTING THE CRIME,

124
00:03:38,054 --> 00:03:40,056
YOUR HUSBAND GOT 14 YEARS FOR

125
00:03:40,056 --> 00:03:41,991
THIS.

126
00:03:41,991 --> 00:03:42,659
WHAT ABOUT FAIR SENTENCING?

127
00:03:42,659 --> 00:03:43,860
IS THAT A CLAIM THAT YOU TRIED

128
00:03:43,860 --> 00:03:45,962
TO MAKE WITH THE JUDGE THE LAST

129
00:03:45,962 --> 00:03:47,764
TIME AROUND IN 2016?

130
00:03:47,764 --> 00:03:50,400
WHY WAS THERE NO OPEN EAR FOR

131
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:51,101
THAT, DO YOU THINK?

132
00:03:51,101 --> 00:03:55,171
>> I THINK THAT CERTAINLY MY

133
00:03:55,171 --> 00:03:56,439
HUSBAND IS SERVING MORE TIME

134
00:03:56,439 --> 00:03:57,774
THAN ANY OTHER GOVERNOR HAS EVER

135
00:03:57,774 --> 00:03:58,174
SERVED.

136
00:03:58,174 --> 00:04:00,443
BUT ALSO MORE TIME THAN ANY

137
00:04:00,443 --> 00:04:01,678
OTHER POLITICIAN FOR CHARGES

138
00:04:01,678 --> 00:04:04,147
THAT HAVE TO DO WITH SIMPLY

139
00:04:04,147 --> 00:04:04,581
FUND-RAISING.

140
00:04:04,581 --> 00:04:05,348
YOU HAVE TO REMEMBER THAT THERE

141
00:04:05,348 --> 00:04:07,784
WAS NO KICKBACK TO US, NO FANCY

142
00:04:07,784 --> 00:04:10,553
CARS OR TRIPS.

143
00:04:10,553 --> 00:04:13,189
NO USE AND MISUSING OF THE

144
00:04:13,189 --> 00:04:13,656
CAMPAIGN FUNDS.

145
00:04:13,656 --> 00:04:16,793
AND PERSONAL ENRICHMENT OF ANY

146
00:04:16,793 --> 00:04:17,894
TIME IT WAS FOR THE CAMPAIGN

147
00:04:17,894 --> 00:04:18,194
FUND.

148
00:04:18,194 --> 00:04:23,166
IT IS DARK HOW UNJUST THE

149
00:04:23,166 --> 00:04:26,770
SENTENCE IS.

150
00:04:26,770 --> 00:04:27,470
ESPECIALLY GIVEN THAT NOTHING

151
00:04:27,470 --> 00:04:29,773
EVER HAPPENED.

152
00:04:29,773 --> 00:04:31,141
THESE WERE ACTUALLY ALL

153
00:04:31,141 --> 00:04:32,008
ATTEMPTS.

154
00:04:32,008 --> 00:04:34,544
NOTHING WAS EVER EVEN CONCLUDED.

155
00:04:34,544 --> 00:04:36,079
THERE WERE NO CONTRIBUTIONS MADE

156
00:04:36,079 --> 00:04:37,580
OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT.

157
00:04:37,580 --> 00:04:39,582
THEY STEPPED IN AND STOPPED MY

158
00:04:39,582 --> 00:04:41,651
HUSBAND BEFORE ANYTHING EVEN

159
00:04:41,651 --> 00:04:42,018
HAPPENED.

160
00:04:42,018 --> 00:04:43,386
>> Martha: THE JUDGE AND THE

161
00:04:43,386 --> 00:04:45,155
JURY, BASICALLY TOLD THE JURY

162
00:04:45,155 --> 00:04:48,158
THAT THEY HAD TO LOOK AT TO THAT

163
00:04:48,158 --> 00:04:49,225
ATTEMPT AS BASICALLY A DONE

164
00:04:49,225 --> 00:04:49,626
DEAL.

165
00:04:49,626 --> 00:04:52,595
AND IT SEEMED LIKE THAT WAS

166
00:04:52,595 --> 00:04:53,263
CONVINCED TO DO IN THE CASE.

167
00:04:53,263 --> 00:04:54,164
I HOPE THAT YOU WILL COME BACK

168
00:04:54,164 --> 00:04:54,998
AND TALK TO US.

169
00:04:54,998 --> 00:04:56,232
WE WILL FOLLOW THIS.

170
00:04:56,232 --> 00:04:58,201
WE WILL SEE WHAT THE PRESIDENT

171
00:04:58,201 --> 00:04:58,635
DECIDES TO DO.

172
00:04:58,635 --> 00:00:00,000
AN OPTIMISTIC DAY FOR YOU AND
