these preschool boys and girls are having a hot at the local soda fountain innocent of a new and deadly menace lurking behind closed doors the burning weed with its roots in hell marijuana is not the kind of thing that ought to be legalized it ought not to be minimized marijuana makes people retarded murder good people don't smoke marijuana I find it hilarious that the conservatives who are staunchly against weed are the ones who could benefit most from a little puff puff pass I'm not able to be rushed this fast it makes me nervous come on Jeff a joint would help ease the heartache of the trials and tribulations of your relationship with Donnie I mean you two are like the Ross and Rachel of the White House and Ann if there's anyone in the world who could do with kicking back and letting their horns down with the spliff it's you but despite this conservatives across America are applauding Jeff Sessions war on weed why you may ask because one as Colt approves they are absurdly misinformed and I'll still getting that information on the effects of weed from the likes of spicy the opioid addiction crisis blossoming in so many states around this country the last thing that we should be doing is encouraging people there are still a federal law that we need to abide by when it comes to recreational marijuana Yeah right guys sorry how many weed does kill over 33,000 American each year due to overdose right basically the same thing but two and most importantly they are mind numbing Lee absurd hypocrites because remember conservatives are the ones screaming from the rooftops about free market and cutting taxes yet they are blatantly ignoring the latest reports from Colorado and Oregon both states that are benefiting enormous Lee hugely some would say from legalizing marijuana as of this past May Colorado has reportedly collected nearly half a billion dollars in marijuana taxes and used the money for things such as school construction regulation and enforcement of marijuana laws substance abuse treatment programs as well as public education campaigns meanwhile Oregon collected 60 million in marijuana taxes in 2016 alone not to mention that the money from not incarcerated people for smoking weed only further adds to the money in the piggy bank that can be spent I don't know launching a statewide Ultimate Frisbee League instead of being wasted like the tax dollars spent refilling Trump's private jet to Merrill I going back now one legislator who sees the light is cory booker get it light it's in like lighting up no all right well booker is fighting for potheads everywhere with his proposed marijuana justice act that would change marijuana laws to regulate it in the same way we currently regulate alcohol and tobacco now we don't know will a Booker will succeed in his effort but the statistics from Colorado and Oregon do make you wonder if the Trump administration is genuinely interested in offering tax breaks to the hard-working middle class as we help throughout the campaign why is sessions seeking to reverse the Obama administration's relaxed approach to enforcing federal marijuana laws in states that have legalized weed I mean I know you guys aren't so fond of the green but I at least would have thought that the idea of more of the other kind of green would give you a high oh that's right really I forgot you guys really couldn't give a shit about what the people want because a recent Harvard Harris poll shows that 57% of Americans believe that legalizing marijuana across all 50 states would make society better and sixty nine percent said they wouldn't be followed by pot being legal in their state just 37 percent of Americans said cannabis should only be legalized for medical purposes while 49 percent of voters said marijuana should be legal for both medical and recreational use meanwhile only fourteen percent of voters said marijuana should be completely illegal only 14 percent I mean if my math is correct that means there's a lot of marga supporting weed smokers who want to get America high again that's an overwhelming majority of Americans who don't support what Trump's AG is doing what have happened to it in America first but the truth is the reason people like sessions want to continue to criminalize weed is not because of the war on drugs is because of fear before it is too late keeping weed as a Schedule one drug which puts it in the same category as heroin and PCP means people will remain afraid because fear and conservatism go hand-in-hand fear of socialism fear of high taxes fear of immigrants fear of Muslims fear of laws favoring conservative Christian views being overturned fear of progress they rely on keeping their voters petrified by every little thing so when a black man came into office and initiated efforts to decriminalize weed they shit themselves they don't want their voter base to understand that legalization represents progress and to figure out that there's nothing more relaxing than puffing a J now they want a base filled with good old-fashioned strict Christian steps to an outrage I'm terrified and the thought of someone smoking a plant you can only hope that Cory Booker gains widespread support from other legislators in this fight because he's the hero pot heads need but unfortunately he's not the one making the rules this guy is please for the love of God and for the sake of this great nation past this old geezer a joint for me on instagram at Francis M Maxwell and on Twitter and Francis M Maxwell like share the video
