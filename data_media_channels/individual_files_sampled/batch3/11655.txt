well one of the most anticipated events of 2017 was the start of Donald Trump's term in the White House the president has taken to Twitter overnight to congratulate the American people on the New Year and stressed that together they are making the country great again here's a quick look back at the man who's turned u.s. politics on its head Bing Bing Bing could you I'm like a smart person watch you being played how am i doing am i doing okay I'm president Hey I'm president did you believe it as Donald Trump celebrates his second Christmas after being elected US president we're gonna go over his top 2017 stocking stuffers memorable moments from his first year in the White House thank you everybody thank you very much just for you Mike this isn't the kind of behavior that you'd normally expect from a US president during an official meeting you also wouldn't expect Twitter to be turned into an official White House Channel but as commander in chief Donald Trump has actually given America's teenagers a run for their money with over 2,500 tweets much like Charles Dickens fictional real estate owner Manhattan's favorite Scrooge has his very own ghost of Christmas past the Russia collusion story just doesn't seem to go away as the probes and investigations continue despite the lack of any sustainable evidence now Donald Trump's 2017 holiday wish list includes a second special counsel to investigate Bob Muller the first special counsel who is appointed to investigate Donald Trump now this could be a slippery slope next there could be a third special counsel appointed by Congress to investigate Donald Trump second this could just go on and on and on Donald you can't hide from me I see in here everything you do because you're a ghost yes so Donald Trump decided to make good on one of his election promises and bring peace to the Middle East wait it was his other election promise to recognize Jerusalem as Israel's capital so far no peace we wish you a very happy Monica and I think this one will go down as especially special right now I'm thinking about what's going on and the love that's all over Israel and all about Jerusalem the president has had plenty to boast about in 2017 especially his range of very dangerous toys we are so proud of our military and it was another successful event so what happens as I said we've just launched 59 missiles heading to Iraq yes heading toward Syria now this time of year I'm a lot of us enjoy word games with our family and friends well Donald Trump doesn't care what time of year it is or how dangerous the game might get take his challenger Kim jong-un the North Korean crisis left us all breathless wondering if the next word might be World War 3 we are totally prepared for the second option totally destroy North Korea is a sick puppy Rocketman is on a suicide mission for himself what presidents do this sending a strong message in language that give Yahoo would understand the North Korean regime is calling president Trump's words a load of nonsense North Korea's Supreme Leader fired back at trump accusing the president of being a mentally deranged US dotard a Korean insult roughly meaning senile idiot obviously he's a pretty smart cookie well whether you support him or not 2017 was quite a spectacular year for Donald Trump there's been explosions late nights on Twitter and regional shakeups 2018 is now here and it seems like the POTUS has plenty more up his sleeve caleb Maupin RT New York
