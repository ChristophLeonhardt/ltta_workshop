top US Democratic lawmaker has called for emergency meetings on alleged Russian meddling that's on top of the three major investigations already underway in the United States Jerrold Nadler thinks the current administration is not doing enough to address the threat which he describes as being equivalent to bombs and bullets what to protect ourselves this is a very severe threat and this is as much an attack on the United States as if there were bombs and bullets it's an attack on our essential governing structure amid the continuing allegations of Trump Russia ties one of the investigators on the Senate Intelligence Committee has found himself embroiled in controversy Jaqueline Booga has the details in case you haven't noticed the Democratic Party is very worried about big bad Russia they found portals into our society the Kremlin clan Russia has harnessed the tremendous and quite frankly to me frightening power of social media truly troubling evidence of the scope and reach of Russia's interference in our last election and the top Democrat on the Senate's Russian investigation mark Warner is no exception to the rule I'm concerned that the president still does not recognize the severity of the threat but apparently Warner does and he will do anything necessary to battle Moscow's reach based on leaked text messages between the senator and a second party it looks like when it comes to the Russian threat the ends justifies any means including attempting to carry out some collusion of your own several of the messages show Warner trying to arrange a secret meet up with Christopher Steele the former spy behind the now infamous Trump dossier we want to do this right private in London I want to send letter yet because if we can't get agreement would rather not have paper trail so who was Warner depending on to set up the clandestine meeting with Steele that would be one mr. Adam Waldman a lobbyist best known for acting on behalf of the Russian tycoon ally Diddy Bosca and according to the text Wallman is also connected to Julian Assange another person accused of being a Kremlin puppet now this is all way under the table Warner repeatedly refused to make the invitation to speak to seal officially in writing while at the same time telling Walden that the Paris efforts would be helping America and apparently in his mind the way to do that is to be in cahoots with the confident of one of the richest men in Russia and according to Republican senator mark Rubio the whole Senate Intelligence Committee has known about the context for months so if neither the Democrats nor the Republicans care about Warner's conduct is that just that collusion is a problem reserved for only one party or is the reality here that Russia is just being used in a political game of chess won or said at one point we have to be careful of paraphrasing here I don't want a paper trail now if what he was doing was fine and dandy and innocuous and no big deal then why would he care if there was a paper trail he certainly should have or his staff should have known who he was communicating with who this lobbyist represented if you're going to talk to a lobbyist about getting a one-on-one face-to-face with Christopher Steele then you should know who you're dealing with in trying to arrange that needing the fix was in the ties are between the Democrats and and Russia more so than anything Trump ever had to do with Russia but it just shows what hypocrites they are and the American media just ignores these things
