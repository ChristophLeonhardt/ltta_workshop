00:00:00,544 --> 00:00:05,248
>> Tucker: WE ARE OUT OF TIME.

2
00:00:05,248 --> 00:00:06,683
HARRIS IS NOT SUGGESTING THE

3
00:00:06,683 --> 00:00:08,318
MASSES GO OPIATES.

4
00:00:08,318 --> 00:00:11,888
CALIFORNIA IS FAILING FAST.

5
00:00:11,888 --> 00:00:14,157
WHERE ONLY IMMIGRANT AND WEALTHY

6
00:00:14,157 --> 00:00:19,429
TECH BARONS FEEL VEHICLE.

7
00:00:19,429 --> 00:00:22,666
HYGIENE IS AN ISSUE.

8
00:00:22,666 --> 00:00:24,101
AND OFFICIAL OUTBREAK OF

9
00:00:24,101 --> 00:00:25,268
HYPOTHETICAL A IT IS

10
00:00:25,268 --> 00:00:27,004
A NECESSITY.

11
00:00:27,004 --> 00:00:29,106
SHOT BY A RECENT FELLOP WHO WAS

12
00:00:29,106 --> 00:00:32,075
SHIELDED BY THE SANCTUARY

13
00:00:32,075 --> 00:00:33,510
POLICY.

14
00:00:33,510 --> 00:00:37,714
STENCH OF URINE AND FESES IS

15
00:00:37,714 --> 00:00:38,682
TRONNING.

00:00:40,117 --> 00:00:40,450
CITY.

18
00:00:40,450 --> 00:00:42,886
>> THEY WOULD HAVE ARRESTED MORE

19
00:00:42,886 --> 00:00:46,857
IMMIGRANT BUT OAKLAND'S MAYOR

20
00:00:46,857 --> 00:00:50,694
ISSUED A AT THE SAME TIME AND

21
00:00:50,694 --> 00:00:52,295
WARNED OF THE RAIDS.

22
00:00:52,295 --> 00:00:54,131
>> Tucker: CALIFORNIA MATTERS.

23
00:00:54,131 --> 00:00:56,266
VICTOR IS A LIFELONG RESIDENT OF

00:00:56,266 --> 00:00:58,135
THE STATE AND JOINS US TONIGHT.

THANK YOU FOR COMING ON.

27
00:01:05,474 --> 00:01:07,911
DISTRIBUTION OF CALIFORNIA

28
00:01:07,911 --> 00:01:09,279
RECENTLY HAS MED I CAN'T HAVAL

29
00:01:09,279 --> 00:01:10,714
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

30
00:01:10,714 --> 00:01:12,716
>> IT MEANS 75 PERCENT OF THE

31
00:01:12,716 --> 00:01:20,624
DPSHGS -- GEOGRAPHICAL PEOPLE.

32
00:01:20,624 --> 00:01:23,527
AND COASTAL CORRIDOR WHERE WE

33
00:01:23,527 --> 00:01:27,798
CAL- TECH AND STANFORD AND 3

34
00:01:27,798 --> 00:01:28,832
TRILLION IN CAPITALIZED SILICON

35
00:01:28,832 --> 00:01:30,067
COMPANY AND THIS IS WHERE ALL OF

36
00:01:30,067 --> 00:01:31,401
THE POLICY IS MADE.

37
00:01:31,401 --> 00:01:33,470
AND THE PEOPLE WHO MAKE IT.

38
00:01:33,470 --> 00:01:36,473
LAWYERS AND ACADEMICS AND

39
00:01:36,473 --> 00:01:39,409
POLITICIANS ARE NEVER SUBJECT OF

40
00:01:39,409 --> 00:01:41,144
THE RAMIFICATIONS BECAUSE THEY

41
00:01:41,144 --> 00:01:43,213
HAVE SUCH WELT.

42
00:01:43,213 --> 00:01:46,450
CALIFORNIA IS A MEDEVIAL SOCIETY

43
00:01:46,450 --> 00:01:49,953
BECAUSE WE HAVE THE HIGHEST

44
00:01:49,953 --> 00:01:54,591
BASKET OF GASOLINE SALES AND

45
00:01:54,591 --> 00:01:57,861
RANK 49 OR 45 IN SCHOOL.

46
00:01:57,861 --> 00:02:01,598
AND HIGHEST KILOWATT.

47
00:02:01,598 --> 00:02:03,733
AND WILL GASOLINE IS THE HIGH OF

48
00:02:03,733 --> 00:02:04,034
THE.

49
00:02:04,034 --> 00:02:05,936
AND IT DOESN'T AFFECT THE PEOPLE

50
00:02:05,936 --> 00:02:07,337
MAKING THE REGULATION.

51
00:02:07,337 --> 00:02:09,673
WHERE I WORK AT STANFORD.

52
00:02:09,673 --> 00:02:11,308
IT IS 75 OR 65 DEGREES.

53
00:02:11,308 --> 00:02:14,945
THEY DON'T HAVE TO TURN ON THE

54
00:02:14,945 --> 00:02:18,548
HEATER OR AIR CONDITIONING.

55
00:02:18,548 --> 00:02:20,450
BUT IN THE VALLEY.

56
00:02:20,450 --> 00:02:22,786
POOR PEOPLE GO TO WALMART

57
00:02:22,786 --> 00:02:24,988
BECAUSE THEY CAN'T TURN ON THE

58
00:02:24,988 --> 00:02:26,289
AIR CONDITIONING.

59
00:02:26,289 --> 00:02:29,993
THEY DON'T BELIEVE IN WATER FOR

60
00:02:29,993 --> 00:02:33,196
THE AGRICULTURE.

61
00:02:33,196 --> 00:02:35,932
BUT THEY DO IN ARCHITECTURE.

62
00:02:35,932 --> 00:02:38,635
AND THAT REVERBATES IN

63
00:02:38,635 --> 00:02:41,004
CALIFORNIA AND IT IS

64
00:02:41,004 --> 00:02:43,306
DYSFUNCTIONAM SAY THE.

65
00:02:43,306 --> 00:02:47,043
MIDDLE-CLASS, 4- 5 PEOPLE LEFT.

66
00:02:47,043 --> 00:02:48,912
AND 4- 5 PEOPLE COME ILLEGALLY

67
00:02:48,912 --> 00:02:51,848
FROM SOUTHERN MEXICO AND GLOBAL

68
00:02:51,848 --> 00:02:53,150
WEALTH IN A SMALL AREA.

69
00:02:53,150 --> 00:02:54,417
AND YOU PUT THAT TOGETHER.

70
00:02:54,417 --> 00:02:56,720
AND YOU GET WHAT YOU HAVE NOW.

71
00:02:56,720 --> 00:00:00,000
>> Tucker: IT IS UNBELIEVABLE.
