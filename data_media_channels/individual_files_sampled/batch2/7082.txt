there is a wide range of opinions on whether Democrats should pursue impeachment against Donald Trump and and I think it is an interesting question I don't think it's a foregone conclusion even at this late date there are 58 Democrats who have signed on for impeachment there are other Democrats who think 25th amendments the right way to go leadership right now it doesn't believe that any of those paths should be pursued now I think that there are legitimate reasons to think that and and I'm going to talk about that in a second but as I read an article in Politico talking about why the Democrats are doing this or in this case not doing this well there was something in there that was the usual Democratic stuff that drives me crazy so Jerry Nadler is is very important to the Democrats in this regard because he's a top Democrat on the House Judiciary Committee if the Democrats were to retake the house which now actually looks pretty much likely even Chris Wallace on Fox News talking about how 40 seats are likely to swing in favor of the Democrats well then Jerry Nadler would be the head of the committee that would pursue impeachment if they were to go in that direction so let's look at his quotes and let's begin to analyze this he said impeachment it's not something you ought to welcome it's not something you ought to be ready to it's not something you want okay now look that's a fair starting point and it's totally fine it's you shouldn't look forward to impeachment with Glee I mean it depends on the facts it depends on the situation and you can't impeach someone because of horrible policies I think Trump has horrible policies but sad day for us he won the election that's how elections go so go out and vote I think he's unstable that could be a 25th amendment issue but in order to do impeachment you have to actually have something that he's done against the law there's an argument to be made that you can do impeachment for other reasons but it's not an argument that's likely to win so and and I robert muller certainly might find something on him and I think he will Matt's my personal opinion and I think that at that point impeachment certainly will be worth pursuing if that's the case some people may argument about conflicts of interest and their monuments Klaus and I think those are interesting arguments but now let's go into why the Democrats have decided not to pursue this Politico explains that in fact NAT lers expertise in constitutional law as well as his outsized voice opposing the Clinton impeachment in 1998 was a factor in his selection to lead committee Democrats hmm now if they put a guy who was that gung-ho against the impeachment of Clinton that is a signal that they are saying no we are not going to go towards impeachment if they thought at one at a later date that they might go in that direction they would have put somebody in there that does not have as richer record against impeachment as Nadler does warning sign number one okay Nadler continues and says if we were in the majority and if we decide that the evidence isn't there for impeachment or if the evidence is there we decided would tear the country apart too much there's no buy-in there's no bipartisanship and we shouldn't do it for whatever reason if we decide that then it's our duty to educate the country why we decided it oh boy if he left it at the first half of the sentence and said hey there isn't evidence there well then we can't do it it's a perfectly fair sentence to say you know a lot of Democrats might disagree 3/4 of democratic voters now want impeachment but it's one thing to want impeachment it's another thing to be able to prove it execute it etc and to actually get them out of office but the second half of the sentence where it says even if there is evidence we shouldn't do it because it might quote unquote tear the country apart oh these Democrats yeah yeah so the guy who could lead impeachment if if there is evidence to suggest that he should be impeached is as usual doing a pre-emptive surrender on the issue saying even if there is evidence that he will not pursue it because the Republicans would object yes the truth some of the deplorable zz that support Donald Trump and all right I'm sure and Roger stone and all those monsters would go oh my god you can't do this so you're gonna get bullied by them and you're going to preemptively say that you won't do it even if there is evidence Oh God okay now that you go to Jared Huffman now he supports impeachment but even he says it's a congressman from California he says as someone who favors impeachment I feel strongly it needs to be bipartisan I think that's one of the things Republicans got wrong in 98 that the bipartisan piece of it is assurance to the public that you're not just playing partisan games we're a long way from Republicans joining us now mixed bag there so if you want to get him out of office completely you need two-thirds of the sentence so by definition it has to be bipartisan if you leave it at that nothing wrong with that quote but number one he's going back to 98 because this is a hack stuff that a lot of Democrats and a lot of people unfortunately the mainstream media believe ah you know all politics is local who said that Tip O'Neill I know that that's why I seem like a sage political pundit yet that Tip O'Neill said that back when there was no internet all politics is not local anymore these local newspapers have been wiped out all politics is on the internet now so in to some degree for old people on TV so that's just not true so oh yeah back in 98 98 98 might as well have been 1898 or 1798 so trying to learn lessons that are so outdated is it is not particularly clever they always think like know did you know that in 98 the Republicans became unpopular when they try to an impeachment based on ridiculous grounds yeah of course of course we all know that but it was on ridiculous grounds and in fact back then I was a Republican and I thought that what Bill Clinton had done was wrong but when they pursued impeachment that was one of the first times that I was like whoa that's weird that seems like a bridge too far and they swung a lot of people to the other side but that is not this situation they're not an analogous they're from a long time ago and it tells the other side by the way we think our case might be as ridiculous as your case was no no if Moeller's got him and they the evidence is a perfectly sound case to pursue if but don't surrender ahead of time okay but we need the Republicans to join us if you're gonna premise your entire strategy on Republicans agreeing to do the right thing just clean up and go home already that's unless they're on the very precipice of losing their own seed the Republicans will of their own accord almost never do the right thing like what are you looking for moral fiber you've come to the wrong place so here's more from Politico the debate is roiling House Democrats with progressives forcing a debate over the issue even as vulnerable incumbents particularly members in districts that favorite Trump worry it could jeopardize their future in Congress there you have ladies in here that's the answer right there and this is what Democratic leadership does all times so it is not all Democrats 58 Democrats have already signed on for the impeachment issues Jamie Raskin doing a wonderful job with the 25th amendment issue I think that's actually more fruitful okay but when it comes to leadership oh no we got a perfect we have to protect the most conservative Democrats so we will not fight forward we will not support progressives instead what we will do is try to make sure that the people in the most purple districts are the ones that rule our entire strategy now look it's we're not we know politics I don't want to lose those purple seats nobody wants to lose those purple seats but right now Donald Trump is pulling a 32% that that's not in jeopardy so when you pretend that it's in as much Shepherd II as it has ever been you're doing that to excuse in action and second of all when you consistently program your entire party around the most conservative Democrats you get to another bigger problem which you never acknowledge which is that you don't make the progressive case and you don't fight for the progressive case why oh no no no I don't wanna endanger the Blue Dog Democrats Oh just corporate as democrats I don't want to endanger them let's make sure that leadership sides with them that is a terrible idea that is what has led to surrender after surrender and why Republicans win elections even though Democrats have they all the demographics and all the policy issues on their side okay finally one more piece here for Democrats reluctant even broach the topic that may mean explicit evidence linking Trump to Russian collusion or obstruction of justice and mothers report anything less Bustos and other moderate lawmakers argue and Democrats risk imperiling their House Majority almost as soon as they take control you understand that so first excuse was well we might lose in some of those toss-up States and toss-up districts now it's that poor excuse because as I just told you the polling indicates they're gonna win big so they like oh yeah yeah yeah that's true that's true but once we have the majority we should make sure that we do nothing with it because it would imperil our next election there's never enough excuses for the Democrats for inaction they'll find another one and another one and another one they they keep talking about how they want to keep their powder dry that is the driest powder in the history of politics and then they wonder why we get the sense that they might not fight for us it is their intention even if they win to wait for a Republican approval before they go forward on progressive priorities wow I'm so motivated this is what a losing
