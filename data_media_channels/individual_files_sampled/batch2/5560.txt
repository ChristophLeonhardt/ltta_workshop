Kotori Johnson very clearly acknowledged that Russians are still able to hack into our system just listen one area that we know where the Russians penetrate in 2016 was actually the campaign's their ability to hack into the a the the DNC and released that information on a selective basis campaigns in many ways are the ultimate startups they have very little security built in campaigns are not immune from nation state surveillance nation state hacking this is a scary reality what are we gonna do we've done nothing right we've been talking about it a lot and you know when all of a sudden done lots been said nothing's been done and when we look forward on this there's the three angles to this one is the campaign's they're still going to be targeted we know that by a variety of actors we got the voter databases and then we have the election machine so I thought the report was very good but what was most shocking to me about this report that came out from the Senate Intel committee is normally this is the executive branch that does these reports and starts moving on these things immediately when we have a threat this is the legislative branch essentially forcing this on to the executive branch which is very strange the second thing that report was challenged adversaries says we need to challenge adversaries that if they hack or try and mess with our election systems we will do something in response this has been what 16 18 months now that's been going on we have not responded and instead last night the president gets on a phone call and congratulate somebody else for winning an election after he just messed with our election it is one of the strangest things in American history congratulating him on an election that it is widely believed was rigged well president Trump might not be watching those Senate Intelligence hearings today but he is on Twitter and just a moment ago he tweeted again about Russia and he said they can help solve problems with North Korea Syria Ukraine Isis Iran and even the coming arms race Bush tried to get along but didn't have the smarts Obama and Clinton tried but didn't have the energy or chemistry remember Reese he's through strength it's ridiculous yeah I mean they could help with with Syria if they weren't funding Assad yeah he says they could help us what we're doing is helping him I mean Putin has never been able to achieve so many of his foreign policy objectives in such a short time around the world sure he's faced some pressure from the legislative branch here but president Trump is essentially surrendering in Syria he has not really countered the fact that the Russians are deliberately in Syria they're there to stay and they have gotten the outcome they want which is the Assad regime remaining in power he has hit us in our election system and we have not responded back so when I see the president make those statements that we need him as a partner no the Russians are laughing at us that we are moving back from the world stage and they are moving forward taking whatever they want without any resistance and that's the whole goal of Russian active measures that's the whole playbook the desire by going into our democracy dividing us up pitting us against each other so they can move around the world and achieve what they want well then on that front I want to share what John Brennan said earlier today he spoke to willie Geist because it was jarring I think it just demonstrates that he looks at the world through a prism of what is going to help and protect Donald Trump that is not what presidents are supposed to do I work for six presidents I didn't agree with some of their policies but all of them all of them were trying to do what they thought was best for the United States that's not mr. Trump he is self-absorbed and he is trying to just promote his own interests and protect his flanks and listen this is a fear lots of people have that the president has yet to put country first and we could say oh it's not a big deal that he just wants to make money for his brand but making money for his brand and putting us in a national security crisis or at the very least in harm's way are two different things yeah what is America first according to Trump I don't know what his policy is on Russia all he says is we need them as a partner on all of these other things and he just makes a random list of it but they've actually not it let's take North Korea for example whenever he was in his very aggressive total pressure solution against North Korea Russia stepped in and instead took the world sage said let us be a modifying force for the world here because the United States is acting crazy they see these for some reason the president doesn't understand when he steps into these things he's actually stepping into a trap President Putin wants him to be outrageous he wants him to be out of control and he will embrace him in doing that to achieve his objectives she's you King will you want to step out of TPP no sweat there's others we're gonna separate in Clinton thank you hey there I'm Chris Hayes from MSNBC thanks for watching MSNBC on YouTube if you want to keep up to date with the videos we're putting out you can click subscribe just below me or click over on this list to see lots of other great videos
