so the Republicans want to do tax cuts for the rich and everything else be damned they played a little quarry for a while and I was great quite amused by that well you know they're not quite sure that they won't want this level of tax cuts and it does seem like it's gonna leave a giant hole in deficit 1.7 trillion dollars remember how they pretend to care about the deficit that was a big joke they don't care at all they just want to serve their billionaire don't her friends that's what I maintain throughout but the press dutifully reported what no I don't know maybe Ron Johnson might vote against it cuz he cares about small businesses right okay Susan Collins is a moderate no cheek oh no she's got concerns about how much they're gonna have to cut Medicare and stuff like that John McCain is a maverick he's a maverick he might go to guess they're not gonna vote against it they're gonna vote for it of course they are and so lo and behold what do we find out now John McKay says after careful thought and consideration I have decided that I do serve my donors no I'm sorry said I am decided to support the Senate tax reform bill I believe this legislation though far from perfect would enhance America's competitiveness boost economy and provide long overdue tax relief for middle-class families no it actually raises taxes on the middle assert of the middle class now and almost all the middle class by 2027 10 years from now so that has nothing new with boosting the economy the trickle-down economics has never worked they have no evidence of that and even some of their own economists now saying Wow given this even if that we were to the tax cuts were to boost the economy because of how much money we're giving to the rich the deficits would be so large that would dampen the economy so we'd get no positive results oops but he goes on with this like oh I care about the middle class so I've decided that you know what I should give billions of dollars to the rich okay I take seriously the concern some of my Senate colleagues have raised about the impact of this bill on a deficit however I've decided I don't give a damn because the donors signed my paychecks I'm sorry I mean however it's clear that this bills net effect on our economy would be positive this is not a perfect bill but it is one that would deliver much-needed reforms to our tax code grow the economy help the Americans keep more of their hard-earned money or the Koch brothers keep more of their so-called hard-earned money okay so John McCain's gonna vote yes of course he is the older boat was gonna vote yes the whole point of the Republican Party is to give tax cuts to the rich that's 98% of the reason for their existence the other 2% are more Wars but that actually helps the donors as well and that's why they do another one percent is deregulation which also helps the donors on the rich so when the mother of all tax cuts comes and eighty percent of the gains goes to the top one percent yes of course McCain's gonna vote yes of course Susan Collins is gonna vote yes why they're not actually public servants that's hilarious their donors servants they're basically waiters yes so Charles Koch what would you like for the David Koch what would you like anything you like so here comes the so-called moderate Susan Collins now Talking Points Memo explains the Congressional Budget Office reported earlier in November the tax bills currently on the table would cost the government so much that it would trigger the so-called Pago law putting into motion more than a hundred billion dollars and cuts the federal budget including an immediate twenty five billion dollar cut to Medicare now so since the the size of the tax cuts for corporations and the rich are so gigantic about six and a half trillion dollars in total they have to take a huge chunk of that and raise the taxes for the poor in the middle class by ten years from now everyone making under seventy five thousand dollars will actually pay more not less unbelievable massive redistribution of wealth okay on top of that this takes out the the part of the Affordable Care Act and the mandate that remember Susan Collins and John McCain pretending to care about well we can't just take one part out and they'll destroy the bill now all of a sudden when it's attached the tax cuts like well I mean do we really need health care right and Susan Collins had said oh my god if its cutting Medicare security I'm not gonna do it cuz it's very unpopular right well it turns out it's almost certainly gonna cut Medicare but her donors told her you'd do it otherwise you're fired all of a sudden yes sir what kind of appetizer would you like with that okay so yeah she's gonna vote yes so here's her excuse I met with Senator McConnell just yesterday and he has assured me that that will not be allowed to happen because the Medicare etcetera because they're gonna have to cut like crazy to pay for the rest of the tax cuts for the rich if it were going to occur I would not even be considering voting for this tax bill but wait a minute wait a minute senator Collins is there any assurance in the bill is it written in the bill that you will not cut Medicare or Medicaid or social security nope nope but I have been given assurances I have been given assurances that many years from now that Senator McConnell if he's still in office and I'm still in office we'll do the right thing and and and okay so if you don't cut all those things how are you gonna pay for it I don't know what are gonna do raise tax on the rich you're not gonna do that who the hell are you kidding there are no moderate Republicans they're all work for their donors so is what asked well how do you know Mitch McConnell will do that many years around she said no it's okay because it's quote a personal commitment oh I didn't know it was a personal commitment well then I course go ahead and give all the money to the rich and take it from the middle class as long as McConnell promises later in a personal commitment that they you won't cut Medicare and Medicaid and Social Security total and utter nonsense they're gonna do what they're paid to do which is to serve their donors if you have private financing of Elections they will serve private interests it is a guarantee anyone in the media that doesn't understand that concept doesn't know anything about politics this discussion of their policy difference there is no policy difference there is no disagreement there's no ideological battle there is where do I get my campaign country that's where I get me s I will do exactly as I'm told sir absolutely sir yes sir now what would you like for dessert sir that's who Susan Collins is so john mccain is that's the whole republican party and yes a lot of the democratic party as well and the private financing it's preposterous they have bought our democracy they have captured our government wolf
