another day another attack launched from the right against Senator John McCain over his call to block Gina Haspel from becoming the next head of the CIA over her history of support for torture and also her history of torturing people he's not a fan of that and the rights not a fan of him for not being a fan of that although he himself has been tortured so you can sort of understand why he's coming from where he is now this time the attack is actually coming from inside the White House it happened at a communications meeting with several dozen people present and what's the first name police Sadler said this it doesn't matter he's dying anyway and this is according to a source at the meeting and just as a general bit of advice for the White House if you have a meeting and there are two dozen people there don't say anything you don't want being in the Washington Post the next day because there ain't no chance that it's not getting leaked but she apparently said that and another source confirmed it both sources said they believe the comment was intended as a joke but that it did not go over well with others at the meeting and it was described as uncomfortable afterward that's good news I was worried that everyone would have just like you've like laughed uproariously yeah well I guess that is slightly good news by the way to absolutely confirm she then apologized called and apologized to Meghan McCain hmm even though others attempted for a while to pretend that it hadn't happened or that was just an allegation now she initially didn't respond to a request for comments the White House put out a statement sort of a general statement of support for John McCain that I thought it was interesting nobody signed it was just the White House perhaps they were wondering where Donald Trump would come out on this whole thing and they didn't want to be on the wrong side of it can you consider yourself a conservative whose so-called pro-life if you joke about someone dying of cancer well is there I mean what are the positions that people in the Trump White House actually holds who knows yes this money yeah more money for us in particular and no one else that's definitely a position held by the White House and that's about it she apparently worked for The Washington Times before so one of these you know right-wingers zealots etceteras and so not very surprising her job is to fight against illegal immigration as they frame it again not surprising that then you would find a vicious person to hold that job but I have a slightly different take on this look on the one hand they're just so terrible to McCain over and over again these right-wingers I mean I thought we were at the bottom of the barrel yesterday with Fox News saying that he was songbird John and gave away our secrets to the North Vietnamese when he distorted we didn't lie but as I've told you a million times there is no bottom to that barrel so then then Kelly Sadler goes oh yeah Fox News hold my beer now so yes on the other hand they do far worse and so it was a stupid joke in the midst of this thing it shows how callous they are but I feel like it's not one of the more important things like what and and it goes towards one of my pet peeves about media coverage which is that they're so obsessed with civility and part of why they can't stand Trump but to the detriment of substance so the fact that Jeannie Haspel ordered the torture people and then destroyed that evidence to me is a billion times more important than a stupid and thoughtless and callous joke that some staffer made about John McCain but for the press they're like Oh John McCain is beloved this joke is unacceptable you need to be fair they do talk about torture a lot a lot they do a lot but Bennifer right but stuff like this gives huge huge attention the destruction of the tapes they almost never talk about and that to me was the most illegal and most brazen things you did so look I got I have to be honest the coverage that I've seen in regard to Haspel has been good they have talked about the tapes maybe they haven't talked about the tapes as much as we'd like but it's always mentioned in the media coverage that I've seen so I want to give them credit for that you know New York Times did a good job in covering it as well and getting very detailed about what happened under her watch now with that said though I think that this story is important I think that it goes further than you know wagging our finger at people and telling them to be civil I mean the the discourse that you see in the White House has already spread throughout the country and the fish does rot from the head down we are incredibly vicious little animals and you know Trump has opened the floodgates to the point where people think it's okay to openly joke about someone who's dying of cancer so III think that we need to take a step back as a country and you know really have a discussion about whether or not this this is the kind of conversation we want to be having or if this is the way we want to be treating each other over a political disagreement and really you're that loyal to Trump that you're gonna turn around and you know say these vicious things about a man who not only served in the military you know went to Vietnam but was a prisoner of war for years and still didn't cave under that kind of pressure right and and by the way you're doing that to be loyal to who to someone who's a draft dodger you know how to was born with a silver spoon in his mouth like it's just pathetic and disgusting well that's the thing about it it's pathetic and disgusting but we've become so you know it's become so normalized and it's frustrating that this is what we're looking at that when there's a bully making these these horrible jokes in in public and on Twitter that his administration does this that that people who work under him are encouraged to act like this and it's frustrating and then there's a flip side to it where anytime anyone makes even even the slightest joke you know those very Michelle wolf Correspondents Dinner the the outrage from the right about how dare you know she called a Sarah Huckabee Sanders a liar she's a liar like that's fine that's almost not a joke but you know when it comes to something like this like we have to I don't know we have to deal with with this kind of bullying and not be able to fight back it's frustrating I think that we need so I think there will be some on the right who will either not understand the difference between those two things the reaction to this in the reaction of Michelle will for the very least we'll pretend did not understand it on TV because that's their job so I'll explain it to them it's not the joke that's the problem we're analyzing what is the foundation for the joke if Michelle wolf makes a sara huckabee sanders burning facts and creating a perfect smoky eye the foundation is the press secretary is a gigantic a liar and we need to be clear about that so you could say that the jokes a little bit weird maybe but the foundation is strong what is the joke about this from Kelly Adler the joke is he's Against Torture and so screw him screw his entire history nothing that he has ever done matters and he'll soon be gone it's not the joke that's the problem it's the fact that the Republican Party is so willing to turn on one of the Republicans that they almost made president a few years ago because he doesn't like Trump and he doesn't like torture and those two things or either of them is enough to make you irrelevant in the Republican Party yep look a in a sense Trump has tortured the national conversation and so it's gotten uglier and that's why even me today I think like oh they're laughing about how John McCain is gonna die I find that to be kind of a perfectly normal story coming out of the Trump administration yeah and in the old days it would have been outrageous and unthinkable etc but it's fish rots from the head down he is the guy that during the campaign said I prefer people who weren't captured and to Anna's point into this from yesterday when we covered the fox news story about McCain torture doesn't work when John McCain was tortured he gave his other he gave up the names of the other members of the squadron he named the Green Bay Packers offensive line it leads to false information but as long as it makes you feel good because you're being vicious and you're taking out your frustrations as Gina Haspel did they were she'll authorize the waterboarding of Abu Zubaydah eighty three times if it worked why did you need to do it eighty three times so they know that it doesn't work and they do it because they are vicious so them celebrating it internally is
