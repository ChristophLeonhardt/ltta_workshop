-  I like the shirt.
- Thank you, I thought you'd dig it.
The first time I see a Sarah
Press is overrated shirt
will be a very great day indeed.
(laughing)
A lot of people, especially here,
feel like you're just a fantastic debater,
destroyer of liberals and their arguments,
and that's not something
I've actually seen
a lot in practice.
I've seen you out debate
college students, ooh,
so I've seen you out
debate college students,
but they're college students.
If you were debating 19-year-old you,
I have no question that 19-year-old you
would get absolutely destroyed.
And I see you have a kind
of fireside chitchats
with Sam Harris, Jordan Peterson.
-  Post the question, question.
-  That's fine, I
understand, go ahead.
- You're not really debating them
in a substantial way either.
They have differences of opinions,
but I think you more
focus on why you agree
than why you disagree.
So my question is, A, if this is correct
and there are some exemptions,
like the Politicon debate last year,
why do you think this is?
Are liberals afraid to debate you?
Are you afraid to debate them?
Are there a lot of
examples of really great
head-to-head debates
that I'm just missing?
- Sure, I mean if you go back there,
I did a series of debates in Seattle
with a group of folks from
the local head of the NAACP,
a writer for The Seattle Stranger on race,
we did a debate with some
gun experts on gun rights.
I've literally spent my entire
life, my political life,
having conversations
with folks on the left.
In fact, those are the
conversations that I enjoy the most.
As far as why there are
all these tapes of me
destroying liberals at college campuses,
it's because college students
apparently have more courage
that a lot of professional
political pundits
who don't actually wanna get on a stage.
(audience clapping and cheering)
I've invited an inordinate number of folks
on the left onto the Sunday Special,
specifically because I actually prefer,
as opposed to the debate
format, the discussion format
because it allows you to
get a little bit deeper.
Debate formats themselves are
built for how do you destroy
the other side, how do
you undermine a point,
and that's fun, I don't
think it's necessarily
the most productive conversation.
And as you see, like when somebody gets up
and they ask about
nationalized healthcare,
I'm happy to have a
conversation back and forth
in a substantive way about healthcare
looking at the different
priorities and how they reflect.
In fact, if you actually go back
and you watch all the speeches
that I've made on college campuses,
I would say that there are
many more exchanges of me
talking with somebody on the
left in respectful manner
than there are tapes of me,
quote, unquote, destroying anybody.
Those are the ones that
people like to watch
because they're more fun,
but that doesn't mean
that's what's actually
happening on a daily basis.
