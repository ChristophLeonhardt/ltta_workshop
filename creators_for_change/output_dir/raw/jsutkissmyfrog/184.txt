00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,410
hey guys this week I'm just<font color="#CCCCCC"> kiss my frog</font>

2
00:00:01,410 --> 00:00:02,939
I'm gonna be<font color="#E5E5E5"> interrupting our normal</font>

3
00:00:02,939 --> 00:00:04,950
schedule I can't honestly say that

4
00:00:04,950 --> 00:00:06,990
without laughing schedule just kids wore

5
00:00:06,990 --> 00:00:09,150
a knee interrupting our turbulent and

6
00:00:09,150 --> 00:00:11,519
questionable content to focus on

7
00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:13,200
something that<font color="#E5E5E5"> has really bothered me</font>

8
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:15,420
for the last I don't know life today is

9
00:00:15,420 --> 00:00:16,740
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> first day of anti street harassment</font>

10
00:00:16,740 --> 00:00:19,289
week i Nev notice of the thing and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it is</font>

11
00:00:19,289 --> 00:00:21,449
a thing and that makes me hopeful I want

12
00:00:21,449 --> 00:00:22,920
to join in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the hope I don't list of me a</font>

13
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:24,300
week of moaning I don't see a week

14
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:26,010
complaining but I do on it to be a week

15
00:00:26,010 --> 00:00:28,470
of challenges and dressing situations

16
00:00:28,470 --> 00:00:30,000
looking at them from<font color="#E5E5E5"> an analytical point</font>

17
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,098
of view and also just getting more

18
00:00:32,098 --> 00:00:33,660
revealing of togetherness I think what's

19
00:00:33,660 --> 00:00:35,309
great about having weeks themed around

20
00:00:35,309 --> 00:00:36,450
this kind of thing is<font color="#CCCCCC"> it gets people</font>

21
00:00:36,450 --> 00:00:38,190
talking about<font color="#CCCCCC"> it getting an you but</font>

22
00:00:38,190 --> 00:00:39,450
together<font color="#E5E5E5"> trying to orchestrate different</font>

23
00:00:39,450 --> 00:00:41,070
ways<font color="#CCCCCC"> to stop it from</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> happening and and</font>

24
00:00:41,070 --> 00:00:42,239
ultimately just to make you<font color="#CCCCCC"> feel</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font>

25
00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:44,100
<font color="#CCCCCC">you're left alone I know the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> most lonely</font>

26
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:45,180
part of my day is walking home from the

27
00:00:45,180 --> 00:00:47,850
station because I rarely go a day if I

28
00:00:47,850 --> 00:00:50,129
walk home at night without somebody

29
00:00:50,129 --> 00:00:51,930
either following<font color="#E5E5E5"> me shouting something</font>

30
00:00:51,930 --> 00:00:53,760
at me making me feel inferior or

31
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:55,710
sexually harassing me and that that's

32
00:00:55,710 --> 00:00:57,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">what it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is I think I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> love the time we</font>

33
00:00:57,360 --> 00:00:58,890
trivialize it and we think<font color="#E5E5E5"> oh no it's</font>

34
00:00:58,890 --> 00:01:01,140
<font color="#CCCCCC">just we're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just very used to it as women</font>

35
00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:03,000
but actually that's what it is for me

36
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,559
and pretty much every<font color="#E5E5E5"> single girl I know</font>

37
00:01:04,559 --> 00:01:06,240
it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> been going on since to about 12 or</font>

38
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:08,729
13 mainly in our school uniform and to

39
00:01:08,729 --> 00:01:09,840
be honest in the last<font color="#E5E5E5"> 10 years I haven't</font>

40
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:11,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">really seen a decrease in my life of</font>

41
00:01:11,580 --> 00:01:14,159
that thing and that's infuriating I

42
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:15,210
don't know how personal to get with you

43
00:01:15,210 --> 00:01:17,040
guys but I know as I've become more

44
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:18,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">aware of feminism and gender</font>

45
00:01:18,330 --> 00:01:20,759
discrimination I've really seen how it

46
00:01:20,759 --> 00:01:23,100
has affected me in my psyche it's fresh

47
00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:25,080
in my friendships with guys is affecting

48
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:26,460
my own relationship with my<font color="#E5E5E5"> fiance</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

49
00:01:26,460 --> 00:01:28,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">expected the way I feel about my body</font>

50
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:30,270
sometimes<font color="#CCCCCC"> even more</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> personally than the</font>

51
00:01:30,270 --> 00:01:31,799
media the thing with the<font color="#E5E5E5"> media is that</font>

52
00:01:31,799 --> 00:01:33,390
we've been<font color="#E5E5E5"> very aware for the past 10</font>

53
00:01:33,390 --> 00:01:34,799
years<font color="#E5E5E5"> it has been lying to us and it's</font>

54
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:36,570
been a source of conversation at least a

55
00:01:36,570 --> 00:01:38,729
point of discussion about how the media

56
00:01:38,729 --> 00:01:40,439
is lying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to us that how we should look</font>

57
00:01:40,439 --> 00:01:42,659
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually I think street harassment</font>

58
00:01:42,659 --> 00:01:44,070
affected me more because it's so

59
00:01:44,070 --> 00:01:45,930
personal it's so direct is it's in my

60
00:01:45,930 --> 00:01:48,149
face is directed towards my body it's on

61
00:01:48,149 --> 00:01:49,979
my streets in my home I don't see<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

62
00:01:49,979 --> 00:01:51,360
many<font color="#E5E5E5"> women out on the street in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> my area</font>

63
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:53,009
<font color="#CCCCCC">and I think it's because of that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

64
00:01:53,009 --> 00:01:55,530
streets are<font color="#E5E5E5"> ours too and making us feel</font>

65
00:01:55,530 --> 00:01:56,850
that we can't go out in them or that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

66
00:01:56,850 --> 00:01:58,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">don't own them we don't have a right to</font>

67
00:01:58,170 --> 00:02:02,390
occupy that space in the same way is

68
00:02:03,110 --> 00:02:04,950
well there's no words like they're

69
00:02:04,950 --> 00:02:06,570
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> shitty</font>

70
00:02:06,570 --> 00:02:08,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">oh sweet community discussing those</font>

71
00:02:08,070 --> 00:02:09,869
issues talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about what we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can do to</font>

72
00:02:09,869 --> 00:02:11,910
prevent it laughing at those issues a

73
00:02:11,910 --> 00:02:13,620
little bit having a giggle I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">discussing openly please share it</font>

82
00:02:28,230 --> 00:02:29,730
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a lot of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> society's</font>

83
00:02:29,730 --> 00:02:31,590
issues filter down into kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> street</font>

84
00:02:31,590 --> 00:02:33,690
behavior and I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think if we change Street</font>

85
00:02:33,690 --> 00:02:35,640
behavior we can filter that back up into

86
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:38,520
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> pyramid of shit maybe maybe shot to</font>

87
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:39,870
change things<font color="#E5E5E5"> at least dilute them a</font>

88
00:02:39,870 --> 00:02:41,160
little bit at this point I just<font color="#E5E5E5"> can't</font>

89
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:43,020
imagine<font color="#E5E5E5"> knowing what I know about the</font>

90
00:02:43,020 --> 00:02:45,930
street at least in Britain sending a

91
00:02:45,930 --> 00:02:48,080
daughter out into that street harassment

92
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:50,820
limits people's mobility and access to

93
00:02:50,820 --> 00:02:52,739
<font color="#E5E5E5">public spaces to form of gender violence</font>

94
00:02:52,739 --> 00:02:54,810
and it's also<font color="#E5E5E5"> human rights</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> violation of</font>
