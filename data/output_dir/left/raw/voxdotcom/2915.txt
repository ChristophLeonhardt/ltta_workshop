1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:05,740
“I say this over and over again; this is
not a system that belongs to Tayyip Erdogan”

2
00:00:05,740 --> 00:00:09,610
It's really never a good sign when
a person one refers to himself in the third

3
00:00:09,610 --> 00:00:13,730
person. “I am a mere mortal… i can die at any

4
00:00:13,730 --> 00:00:16,470
time.” and more importantly has to repeatedly

5
00:00:16,470 --> 00:00:17,890
deny that they're a dictator.

6
00:00:17,890 --> 00:00:21,830
"Here we have an election, if you say a ballot box produces a dictatorship, then you are

7
00:00:21,830 --> 00:00:27,609
being unfair to the ballot box process”
On April 16, Turkey narrowly voted yes on

8
00:00:27,609 --> 00:00:30,689
a referendum that will dramatically reorganize the government.

9
00:00:30,689 --> 00:00:34,560
It allows changes that give sweeping powers to the President, Tayyip Erdogan.

10
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:38,200
He could have complete control of Turkey’s budget and military, will be able to appoint

11
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:42,510
judges to the courts without a vote, can dissolve parliament whenever he chooses, and can stay

12
00:00:42,510 --> 00:00:44,870
in power until 2029.

13
00:00:44,870 --> 00:00:49,510
This has prompted concerns that he’s becoming too authoritarian - and these concerns aren’t

14
00:00:49,510 --> 00:00:50,620
that outlandish.

15
00:00:50,620 --> 00:00:53,350
Mostly because Turkey was built by an authoritarian...

16
00:00:53,350 --> 00:00:55,820
What’s interesting about this vote is that
if you look at the arc of modern turkish history,

17
00:00:55,820 --> 00:01:10,460
it begins with Kemal Ataturk

18
00:01:10,460 --> 00:01:13,579
Ataturk was a military general who created

19
00:01:13,579 --> 00:01:18,140
the Republic of Turkey out of the collapsed Ottoman Empire in 1923.

20
00:01:18,140 --> 00:01:21,900
During his 15 years in office, he enjoyed
similar powers now held by Erdogan.

21
00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:25,180
And he used them to build Turkey into a modern and secular state.

22
00:01:25,180 --> 00:01:28,100
Turkey's new government separates church and state.

23
00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:29,620
He banned head coverings,

24
00:01:29,620 --> 00:01:36,460
To Kemal, this headgear, the fez, symbolizes Turkey's oriental fatalism and ignorance. He will abolish it.

25
00:01:36,620 --> 00:01:38,200
He put mosques under state control,

26
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:40,200
Islamic traditions are shattered

27
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:42,760
He made it basically illegal to discriminate against women.

28
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:45,440
He takes pleasure in the company of emancipated women.

29
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:50,380
He made women's education compulsory, he made literacy rates rise,
he made schools opened everyone,

30
00:01:50,380 --> 00:01:53,480
To make a modern nation, all Turkey must be sent to school.

31
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:56,320
Ataturk also industrialized his country.

32
00:01:56,329 --> 00:01:59,509
Under his watch, the industrial sector saw
a sharp increase.

33
00:01:59,509 --> 00:02:03,359
And his liberal foreign policies built a close
relationship with the West which paved the

34
00:02:03,359 --> 00:02:06,710
way for Turkey to join the NATO alliance in 1952.

35
00:02:06,710 --> 00:02:11,959
We know that Ataturk succeeded because for decades Turkey was a modern secular Western country,

36
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:12,660
like he wanted it to be.

37
00:02:12,660 --> 00:02:18,180
Ataturk is dictator, so that Turkey will never again have a dictator.

38
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:23,060
And now you have President Erdogan, President Erdogan is going in literally the opposite direction.

39
00:02:23,069 --> 00:02:25,510
He wants to make the country more openly religious.

40
00:02:25,510 --> 00:02:28,040
He wants to get rid of and has already gotten rid of much of what Ataturk had done.

41
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:32,900
But how does a religious conservative leader acquire so much power in a secular country?

42
00:02:32,900 --> 00:02:36,650
To understand this, you have to know what
happened to Turkey after Ataturk’s death.

43
00:02:36,650 --> 00:02:40,400
For 5 decades, the country was constantly in a state of upheaval.

44
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:43,970
Ataturk had given the military the responsibility of keeping Turkey secular.

45
00:02:43,970 --> 00:02:50,709
And they did so by staging coups in 1960,
71, 80 and again in 1997.

46
00:02:50,709 --> 00:02:54,019
While the interventions were meant to keep Turkey democratic, the instability left the

47
00:02:54,019 --> 00:02:55,220
country in poor shape.

48
00:02:55,220 --> 00:02:58,330
So in the nineties and even to the early two
thousands Turkey had

49
00:02:58,330 --> 00:03:02,190
a totally completely stale economy,
the GDP growth would slow unemployment was

50
00:03:02,190 --> 00:03:05,760
very high, it was seen as a very corrupt country, the government didn’t function.

51
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:07,590
Enter Recep Tayyip Erdogan.

52
00:03:07,590 --> 00:03:10,349
He was the mayor of Istanbul from 1994 to
‘97.

53
00:03:10,349 --> 00:03:15,360
Two years later he was arrested for a public
reading of a politically charged Islamic poem

54
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:17,049
by a Turkish Nationalist.

55
00:03:17,049 --> 00:03:20,540
Turkey was still a majority Muslim nation
and his arrest made him popular with many

56
00:03:20,540 --> 00:03:24,250
who felt oppressed by years of the secular,
military rule.

57
00:03:24,250 --> 00:03:29,460
After a short jail sentence, he formed a moderately-conservative political party, the AKP, which went on to

58
00:03:29,460 --> 00:03:34,310
win a landslide victory in the 2002 elections,
and he became the Prime Minister of Turkey.

59
00:03:34,310 --> 00:03:38,030
Erdogan went on to pull the country out of
poverty by giving more opportunities to Turkish

60
00:03:38,030 --> 00:03:41,349
entrepreneurs and expanding access to foreign markets.

61
00:03:41,349 --> 00:03:44,920
This led to a sharp rise in the GDP and inflation plummeted.

62
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:48,770
Turkey’s success even prompted efforts to
join the EU.

63
00:03:48,770 --> 00:03:50,080
This all made Erdogan wildly popular.

64
00:03:51,100 --> 00:03:56,240
It was like he came onto a boat that was listing, and taking on water, and managed get

65
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:58,240
the water out of the boat and made the boat sail straight again.

66
00:03:58,240 --> 00:04:00,240
So for many years, you could see why a man like this became as powerful as he became

67
00:04:01,300 --> 00:04:03,300
But then he went too far.

68
00:04:03,340 --> 00:04:07,860
Over the next ten years, Turkey continued
to grow economically but Erdogan started pushing

69
00:04:07,860 --> 00:04:10,459
more Islamist and authoritarian policies.

70
00:04:10,459 --> 00:04:14,859
He was quoted saying he did not believe
men and women were equal and that women are

71
00:04:14,859 --> 00:04:16,720
meant to be mothers.

72
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:21,470
His government also began arresting protesters
and journalists under the guise of anti-terrorism

73
00:04:21,470 --> 00:04:22,470
laws.

74
00:04:22,470 --> 00:04:25,560
This stirred unrest in Turkey’s more liberal
urban areas.

75
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:33,120
In 2013, there was a small, peaceful demonstration
in Istanbul’s Gezi park to protest Erdogan’s

76
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:37,870
plans to reconstruct military barracks that
would include a shopping center and a mosque.

77
00:04:37,870 --> 00:04:42,650
Seeing the demonstration as opposition, Erdogan
sent in riot police to remove the protesters

78
00:04:42,650 --> 00:04:44,770
which quickly attracted more protesters.

79
00:04:44,770 --> 00:04:47,820
And it got bigger and bigger because it became
a proxy.

80
00:04:47,820 --> 00:04:53,240
From a protest over a park to a protest of
Erdogan, against how religious he was becoming...

81
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:54,240
And it got violent

82
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:04,700
Previsouly he had not been a brutal ruler. After this, he became a brutal one.

83
00:05:04,710 --> 00:05:08,620
Erdogan began removing Ataturk’s secular laws more aggressively.

84
00:05:08,620 --> 00:05:13,500
He ended the ban on wearing headscarves, tightened
restrictions on alcohol sales, and freed mosques

85
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:14,730
from government control.

86
00:05:14,730 --> 00:05:19,810
Then in 2014, Erdogan was elected president
which in Turkey, is a ceremonial role with

87
00:05:19,810 --> 00:05:21,020
little real power.

88
00:05:21,020 --> 00:05:25,310
But that didn't put an end to the arrests
made across the country, which indicated that

89
00:05:25,310 --> 00:05:26,900
Erdogan was still in charge.

90
00:05:26,900 --> 00:05:30,660
And there were two groups of people who are
terrified by this one were the kind of secular

91
00:05:30,660 --> 00:05:34,039
Turks who look back to Ataturk and said what
the hell is happening to our country?!

92
00:05:34,039 --> 00:05:39,530
And the other was the military and they were the ones, again, who believe that their core mission in life was to keep

93
00:05:39,530 --> 00:05:41,360
Turkey secular and that he was a threat.

94
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:44,699
So in July 2016, they staged a coup and it
almost worked.

95
00:05:44,699 --> 00:05:48,270
There was one problem -- the military couldn’t
get the public’s support this time.

96
00:05:48,270 --> 00:05:52,199
Erdogan had found a way to reach his supporters...

97
00:05:52,199 --> 00:05:54,199
I want to encourage my people to the streets

98
00:05:54,199 --> 00:05:56,199
and invite them to the airports.

99
00:05:56,200 --> 00:06:01,560
And together as people gather, to show them, by letting them come with their tanks,

100
00:06:01,660 --> 00:06:04,960
to see what they are going to do, do it right there to the people.

101
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:09,050
Erdogan had this amazing moment where he used
face time on his iPhone to kind of rally the country

102
00:06:09,050 --> 00:06:15,180
defend the country defend us against the military, come Turks, come to me, come rally around me.

103
00:06:15,180 --> 00:06:16,180
and it worked.

104
00:06:16,180 --> 00:06:18,330
You had secular Turks for the first time in
years defend Erdogan.

105
00:06:18,330 --> 00:06:21,389
You have religious Turks literally stream
from mosques

106
00:06:21,389 --> 00:06:23,800
into the streets to fight the military.

107
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:28,660
The military overstepped, you had Turkish
F-16s fire rockets and missiles at parliament,

108
00:06:28,660 --> 00:06:30,289
Turkish tanks fired on people on the streets.

109
00:06:30,289 --> 00:06:31,639
That was very effective for him.

110
00:06:31,639 --> 00:06:36,570
Erdogan emerged from the fighting more popular
than ever and ramped up his purge of the opposition.

111
00:06:36,570 --> 00:06:41,110
More than 100,000 journalists, academics,
military officers, and politicians have been

112
00:06:41,110 --> 00:06:44,580
arrested since the coup attempt; tens of thousands
remain in detention.

113
00:06:44,580 --> 00:06:49,170
This brings us to the recent referendum, which
follows Erdogan’s post-coup popularity.

114
00:06:49,170 --> 00:06:52,259
He set it in motion to acquire more power
and make it permanent.

115
00:06:52,260 --> 00:06:56,949
But the vote was much closer than he it was
anticipated, suggesting that much of the country

116
00:06:56,949 --> 00:07:01,440
wants to hold onto the secular Turkey created
by Ataturk and they are willing to fight for it.

117
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:05,479
I think you’re gonna have the inevitable
tension between a president who believes he’s

118
00:07:05,479 --> 00:07:10,190
entitled to more power, taking more and more
of it, and what remains a somewhat secular

119
00:07:10,190 --> 00:07:12,040
country not comfortable giving him that power.

120
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:15,100
Do those tensions
play out politically in the courts or in

121
00:07:15,100 --> 00:07:16,099
the streets.

122
00:07:16,099 --> 00:07:19,570
If it’s actual fighting and violence then
what we know as a democratic Turkey

123
00:07:19,570 --> 00:00:00,000
will be be over.
