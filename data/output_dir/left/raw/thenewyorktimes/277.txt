1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,700
“It’s about making
America great again.

2
00:00:02,700 --> 00:00:04,110
Are you with us?”

3
00:00:04,110 --> 00:00:05,820
Republicans and
conservative groups

4
00:00:05,820 --> 00:00:08,820
have poured more than
$10 million into a special election

5
00:00:08,820 --> 00:00:11,190
to fill a congressional
seat in Pennsylvania,

6
00:00:11,190 --> 00:00:13,660
outspending Democrats 10 to 1.

7
00:00:13,660 --> 00:00:14,850
But that’s not all.

8
00:00:14,850 --> 00:00:16,950
In order to stump
for the G.O.P. candidate,

9
00:00:16,950 --> 00:00:22,020
Rick Saccone, President Trump
has visited the district twice.

10
00:00:22,020 --> 00:00:24,310
Vice President Mike Pence
has been there,

11
00:00:24,310 --> 00:00:26,730
as has Ivanka Trump,
the president’s daughter,

12
00:00:26,730 --> 00:00:29,280
and Kellyanne Conway,
the White House counselor.

13
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:31,830
All this for a seat that will
open up again in eight months

14
00:00:31,830 --> 00:00:34,230
with the November midterms.

15
00:00:37,710 --> 00:00:39,760
Most polls point
to a close race,

16
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:41,490
and both Republicans
and Democrats say

17
00:00:41,490 --> 00:00:44,010
there’s far more at stake
than a single seat.

18
00:00:44,010 --> 00:00:46,762
Trump won the district
by 20 points in 2016.

19
00:00:46,762 --> 00:00:48,720
“Donald Trump has won the
state of Pennsylvania.”

20
00:00:48,720 --> 00:00:51,810
Saccone is an Air Force veteran
who shares a vision of the country

21
00:00:51,810 --> 00:00:52,810
with the president.

22
00:00:52,810 --> 00:00:54,300
“The world is in turmoil

23
00:00:54,300 --> 00:00:55,680
and our country is in turmoil.”

24
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:58,430
“Our nation’s infrastructure
is crumbling.”

25
00:00:58,430 --> 00:01:00,460
“North Korea is a dangerous
threat to America.”

26
00:01:00,460 --> 00:01:02,540
The president is a fan, too.

27
00:01:02,540 --> 00:01:04,349
“Rick Saccone said he was
‘Trump before Trump.’

28
00:01:04,349 --> 00:01:05,900
Rick is a great guy.”

29
00:01:05,900 --> 00:01:08,930
Saccone’s opponent is
Conor Lamb, a former Marine

30
00:01:08,930 --> 00:01:10,010
and federal prosecutor.

31
00:01:10,010 --> 00:01:12,600
“People in my party don’t
support natural gas drilling.

32
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:13,570
I do.”

33
00:01:13,570 --> 00:01:15,860
A moderate Democrat,
he supports fracking,

34
00:01:15,860 --> 00:01:18,110
believes life begins at conception

35
00:01:18,110 --> 00:01:20,570
and is opposed to adding
new gun control measures.

36
00:01:20,570 --> 00:01:22,400
“Medicare for all or single payer —

37
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:23,460
I don’t support that.”

38
00:01:23,460 --> 00:01:25,630
And he has pointedly
distanced himself

39
00:01:25,630 --> 00:01:27,210
from the House Democratic leadership.

40
00:01:27,210 --> 00:01:29,860
“I didn’t support Nancy Pelosi
for any leadership position.”

41
00:01:29,860 --> 00:01:32,460
But while a victory for Lamb
could offer some insight

42
00:01:32,460 --> 00:01:35,670
into how Democrats can win
back working-class voters,

43
00:01:35,670 --> 00:01:38,010
and build momentum
for the midterms,

44
00:01:38,010 --> 00:01:40,440
it would also be
a blow to Nancy Pelosi.

45
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:43,040
For the G.O.P., the special election
is a proving ground for the

46
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:45,870
president’s political gamble
on steel tariffs,

47
00:01:45,870 --> 00:01:47,810
and a chance to test
whether rank-and-file

48
00:01:47,810 --> 00:01:50,910
union members who
voted for Trump in 2016

49
00:01:50,910 --> 00:00:00,000
will also cast their ballot for
other Republican candidates.
