hi I'm max Gaza this is the Kaiser report Stacy max we're gonna talk about Elon Musk but first I want to talk about a little story that has happened to me over the past few days because I was waiting for a FedEx package and this FedEx package was they failed to deliver over and over and over again and I went to Twitter and I said why is FedEx so horrible and why do we always have a good experience with ups UPS is always really nice we see them in our neighborhood delivering all these Amazon packages and blah blah blah and it turns out people said UPS is fully unionized and they all have benefits and you know stable you know schedules and stuff like that all the FedEx guys are their private contractors they have no rights no negotiating power or anything and I visibly saw that in my own experience I had no idea here's a headline from other drones from 2010 it says FedEx versus ups on unionization there was actually a big battle all the FedEx people are trying to get unionized but because they fall under a different labor rights relationship because I started as an air air delivery service rather than ground delivery service they can't unionize so I truly had no idea that that UPS have been unionized and FedEx not but in my own experience it was just this like complete nightmare we had an experience last year with FedEx as well you remember that they've lost a package so just my own personal experience without knowing anything just in interaction with these two corporations the experience compared to what is the fact for the workers showed up on my own personal experience with them that's real anecdotal evidence on the ground research and what it's so what have you gleaned from this I gleaned that how your workers feel can genuinely impact your brand whether you know shareholders at FedEx of course want the company to maximize profit get as much profit out of every single or pay their workers as little as possible but when you're interacting on it you know you're the person here FedEx sign this you know and you're seeing this horrible interaction you feel like I don't want to use FedEx I'd rather pay twice as much to just use EPS because why would I want something an interaction like that why would I want an experience like that and people these corporations that don't understand how horrible it is to have to deal with their frontline staff if it's not trained if it's not well if you go into some of these big DIY shops for example and you ask one of their customer service reps for information about some plumbing supplies and they have no idea what the anything about that what they're supposed to be an expert on you know these sort of things add up I think FedEx is listed and UPS is not really ah so see this is that the fact that how German companies are so good is they don't list and share hold shareholders demand you destroy their company that's the way things are now they demand that you hollow it out and and destroy all value because they want it now they don't want something in 50 years done they want it now so that would make sense I guess I can't believe it's not listed so Elon Musk's company is of course listed Tesla Elon Musk needs to make a bold call on Tesla's Model 3 before it is too late production hell as Elon Musk calls it has reached a new level of blazing discomfort at Tesla last week the company reported that had fallen well short of his delivery goals for the Model 3 the $35,000 car that is supposed to transform Tesla from a niche player to the dominant force in the new age of electrified automobiles so they did manage to deliver a hundred thousand cars in 2017 which is a new high for them but we're gonna go into how comparing them to the other big auto companies well it's interesting kind of model he has there because he's using the pre-sales on the on the the Model 3 and these cars to kind of keep the company afloat in terms of cash because they burn a lot of cash so he's making a bet that eventually these two things work out and he starts to have some organic growth and which it's not a bad bet to make I mean it worked for Jeff Bezos he lost money for many many years building their brand building their franchise and then it started to work around you should just do an IC o this is like a Tesla coin mmm one day you might get a point you know people throw billions of dollars at icos for products that are even more vague at least he has like actual real example of what a Tesla Model 3 will look like and he has delivered some beyond what he suppose he was meant to but I'll show you the chart of comparing Tesla to other auto 'mobile manufacturers and that is the market cap versus auto sales so GM is the largest market cap on this with fifty point eight billion then Ford at forty three billion Fiat Chrysler at fifteen point seven billion Tesla at forty nine billion but you can actually see the amount of sales GM has to sell three million cars for that 50 billion Tesla's only delivering seventy six thousand for their market cap wishes equals 2 GM so way up for a growth story and this potentially a huge growth story so you multiples are expanding you know people get down on Tesla because they take the government subsidy money but somehow they don't get down on the other big three car companies even though they've been bailed out by government money so whether it's a government bailout or a government subsidy that's still government money so I don't know why Tesla gets all the bad press but actually like you said they buy a growth story that the the growth isn't all that much but it is a mystery their story is a mystery like that whole SpaceX launch that lost that maybe lost the mystery satellite some sort of mystery payload from the US government and but Tesla says it's there their mission was accomplished so it that's all a mystery what happened with SpaceX last week but in terms of like comparing this to initial coin offerings and the crypto space a study found that the less information you actually gave if you had no product no example of what your product was for your initial coin offering you actually got more like the the investors valued you higher as soon as you had any product or example of your technology investors didn't want anything to do with it because there was to real world that wasn't as um as huge as their imagination that's true and all stock markets you know biotechnology companies that have absolutely no technology but they just have a white paper or some academic study suggesting that there could be something bio technologically wonderful if they got a bunch of money raised billions of dollars companies that have a very simple numb nuts business metalbenders who simply manufacture you know parts car parts they have a very low valuation because it's very predictable and very well known but their cash cows if you will this is the type of stuff that warren buffett tends to buy our predictable cash cows and that's his style of doing business and then you have the moonshot look Tesla is a moonshot he's disrupting the auto industry he might do it and in their core he would be worth more than all three combined or he might fail in which case it would be worth the zero like he'd go the way of Enron but that's what capitalism is all about so speaking of cash cows comparing him so remember he basically Tesla and GM have equivalent market capitalizations but GM sells you know many many multiple times more cars so they compare it to more of the balance sheet and the data between these two companies the model three is turning into a slow-motion catastrophe that's going to push Tesla's capital structure beyond the breaking point the math is simple Tesla is spending as much as General Motors every quarter about 1 billion dollars to produce and sell a fraction of the vehicles that GM does GM is also turning that invested capital into steady profits while Tesla in the third quarter of 2017 posted the biggest loss in its history GM has a twenty five billion dollar war chest chesa only has enough cash to operate through 2018 IBM and Dell where the GM and Ford of the day people are comparing look at your sales compared to their sales and we're doing horribly and he stayed loyal to his vision of whatever that vision was and eventually it made have taken twenty years but the same with Tesla in twenty years that might eventually it might take 20 years for them to realize the same sort of Apple like you know I never seen a Dell computer anymore back in the early 90s a Michael Dell told Apple computer to shut their doors and shine shut down no way I don't know that they they were irrelevant they had failed they were never gonna make it and now of course Dell is an also-ran so that's what happens when a visionary matches the times in which he lives with a product that people want and you have an explosion in market capitalization like Apple Computer and Tesla could could be a big winner I mean it could maybe not let me also compare one more thing and then I have a statement to make about this an assessment and analysis to make about this so to make matters worse Tesla striving and failing to build a pretty simple vehicle the model 3 is basically an electric Honda Accord and Honda without noticeable effort builds and sells over 100 thousand of those every single year in the US alone to me it kind of seems like the sort of tension and stress and August and the press towards Steve Jobs back in the 80s at Apple that he was doing it all wrong he's like look at IBM look at Dell they're taking off with this whole market you don't know what you're doing what is this vision you have you just don't know what you're doing this is a-you know and he was kicked off the board and Apple he was you know the same sort of attention on what he's doing with this company Apple and of course you know we all know the success that Apple has become well Steve Jobs is a model in Silicon Valley that you know is Elon Musk going to fit into Steve Jobs shoes by coming up with innovative products you know the electronic gadget market is a little bit different than the car business because the car businesses you know you're kind of bound by the highway system and you're bound by the whole infrastructure that is the automotive industry and the lobbying of the automotive industry so it's a bit difficult to be disruptive in that industry anyway he's going to open up his charging stations with 19:50 style burger and Shake joints with servers on rollerskates okay that's that's an idea that might take off that might be a new like Starbucks like third place that people go to to have an experience that might work I mean he's an innovator he actually does think he's revolutionising the model he he sees himself as a Henry Ford like character Henry Ford revolutionized the production model of automobiles and this is what according to this article Elon Musk also sees that this is the third step in the production of vehicles must dream is to massively automate the model 3 assembly and take advantage of the simpler engineering requirements of electric vehicles it's a noble dream Tesla should continue to pursue it but at this point musk is asking all those model 3 reservation holders to patiently await Tesla's ability to reinvent manufacturing they've become unwitting participants in a science project again going back to 1980s Steve Jobs it did take him a while to realize what he was trying to execute in his mind he's not a technologist he wasn't a code writer he couldn't do all the stuff fast enough once he met a Johnny Iver or whatever they they seemed to have some sort of like you know explosion and their ideas it finally came to fruition but at that time nobody was very patient with Steve Jobs back in the 80s and you remember I'm sure well fascinating unwittingly you will stay tuned for the second half of this program right after this break welcome back to the Kaizen report I'm Max Keiser time now to turn to tyson slocum he runs the public citizen's energy program and serves on the CFTC's Energy Committee Tyson welcome back always great to be here max now the New York Times is quoting you they say about power companies got a tax cut but will the the bill reflect that you are quoted in this tell us more about these tax cuts and will our energy bills be impacted so you know Congress and the president put into law this awful tax bill that was rushed in you know behind the complete darkness qualify this awful in what way it's massively expensive and it goes to huge multinational corporations that aren't necessarily going to be creating jobs you're creating value for the US economy but creating massive benefits for their preferred share how did he get this through this neophyte this idiot this guy who nobody thought could do anything somehow managed to get this massive tax cut through well I think they did it despite Trump and his repeated tweeting on the subject the congressional Republicans have found a new tactic to devise sweeping complex legislation behind closed doors unveil it with as little public scrutiny as possible so that opponents to the sweeping legislation have little time to mobilize to fight the bad legislation so we saw that on other issues that failed with this corporate tax bill there were so many powerful corporations with their hands out in line to get benefits pushing hard on congressional Republicans checks and balances system of our federal government has failed it is failing right now I think that Trump is ushering a new era of it's an institutional failure or in a temporary failure in other words is the character of the way legislation is made and passed in Washington now been co-opted entirely by a corporate agenda it's taken a few decades to get there through the so-called neoliberal Washington Consensus agenda or is this are you suggesting that this is more of a temporary situation what are your thoughts well I think our political system is prone to such takeover and abuse it's a question of leadership in the past we've had enough leadership on a bipartisan basis that that there were enough people to stop these kinds of things on a consistent basis what we're seeing now is a complete absence of leadership I'm not an overly partisan person but what I'm seeing out of the Republican leadership right now is no concern whatsoever for the welfare of their actual constituents welfare bar Lago and said hey everybody he just got a lot richer okay he wanted this and it got through he's demonstrating leadership that's what a leader does he got his agenda through so when he said there's a lack of leadership yes you're referring to the Democrats well I think the Democrats did what they could but they just don't have the numbers right now but I don't think leadership is succeeding on pushing bad policies into law I think leadership is recognizing that you've got to look out for the least among us in our society and there's nothing in this there's a meritocracy going on here in America and you know people are in a position of power and then they try to get things through by the process of legislation lawmaking and the press of course right now what about the fact that the press that would be really in a position to push back against what you're describing as a horrible piece of legislation this tax cuts their obsession with things like the fake Russia gate hoax like inmate Rachel Maddow you turn her on every night and she Oh stills obsessed with this with this hoax this Russia gate hoax so shouldn't she be more concerned about pushing back against this what you described is a catastrophic tax bill well I thought we were talking about journalists I'm not quite sure that Rachel that I was a journey ouch well okay who okay fair enough but who who is operating where's the press you know Jefferson called the press to the Fourth Estate I paraphrase oh you know he said something to that effect but we don't there's a vital part of our nation freedom of the press freedom of speech who's representing those interests I think the traditional print media in a lot of the new online media actually have been doing a great job of reporting on the catastrophic details of the tax bill how unprecedented the the push to quickly move this legislation without a single hearing I think the media is doing their job and I think that's reflected in poll after poll that shows that even though a lot of Americans are temporarily gonna get some money back in their taxes they still don't like the tax bill because it showers the wealthy few and multinational corporations with too much of the benefits okay so in your wheelhouse you're in the energy sector right so we were started off by talking about how this impacts the energy business specifically and I read the New York Times piece you're saying on a state-by-state basis it's unknown because it's a very lot of variation we're in the various states but walk us through like what what does this mean actually to the energy industry good there are some energy companies that are treated as sort of inherently monopolistic and so the trade-off for having a monopoly and therefore being exposed to little risk is that you have to have your profits regulated and so part of your profits are obviously an analysis of your costs and one of those costs are income taxes that you pay so if there is a dramatic change in your corporate income tax liability then that should be reflected in lower rates and therefore lower energy bills for consumers but that's up to regulators to make that determination and my quote the New York Times is something to the effect of there are some states that do a very good job of holding these regulated utilities feet to the fire to make sure that consumers are getting the benefits they deserve and there other states that do a terrible job there's also a federal role here there's an agency called the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission that regulates transmission lines natural gas and oil pipelines and so we're gonna see a similar set of proceedings at the federal level to ensure that the benefits that these energy utilities are going to be receiving from Trump's corporate tax cut that some of that is going to be forced to be shared with end consumers all right now let's get into some nitty-gritty stuff here that you you're in the day-to-day business you're here in Washington you're you know working on behalf essentially you know in the sector of energy and I guess pushing back against abusive energy monopoly power I guess is what you could I try you try to do all right so you also gave testimony to Congress recently in your testimony you noted that the US Energy Information Administration reported that 2016 experienced the largest net increase in generation capacity since 2011 why is this significant well it's significant in the types of new generation capacity that's coming online we're seeing record amounts of coal and nuclear retirements but what we're seeing and that's what this is what the statistics we're talking about is that we're seeing even more new generation mostly natural gas and renewables and when you combine that with the important fact that the United States energy demand is essentially flatlining and actually shrinking as a share of our gross domestic product that is huge for consumers and for energy markets but what that means is that the financial fortunes of the coal and nuclear industry are fading and they're fading pretty fast and so that's what this whole radical they're generating more energy right well that's net but when you look at the different types of generation resources : II clear are being fast a clip eclipsed by lower-cost and easier to deploy resources like natural gas and renewable okay so transitioning to natural gas renewables so these industries are legacy industries are not making as much money as they were that's right okay so they're not happy about it so they're going to the Trump administration and last September the energy secretary Rick Perry unveiled this crazy plan that basically said you know what renewables are so cheap that they're causing the premature retirement of all of these coal and nuclear base load generation and those retirements are going to result in reliability issues down the road and that's a national security concern so national security reasons we have to rewrite America's energy market rules to force consumers to pay extra for these uh neck anomic coal and nuclear units and so this week the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission which is the agency in charge of implementing this requests by the Trump Department of Energy ruled five to nothing tossing out this Rick Perry request saying that it didn't have merit and that there was not a factual basis to rewrite rules because he's coming across like he's a protection racket right right so so check that out right so so that's not bad no it's a good thing except now it punts to what's known as the private entities that operate and run America's electric grid many Americans don't know this but we essentially have privatized grids and not only do those grids manage the physical movement of electrons across the country but they also set up internal rules where policy decisions and rural rewrites are deliberated and so I've called it the privatization of electricity policymaking and so at the same time that FERC five to nothing ruled that this Rick Perry requests was crazy and tossed it out they then said well private regional transmission operators what do you guys think about this issue and so we're gonna see over the next two months some proposals by the grid operators that might do the same thing that that Perry was proposing except dress it up in these ridiculous economic sounding jargon so cuz there's still a big risk to consumers but you know we won the first round but the battle continued so the grid is made up and it's ostensibly for surging surging energy demand it can offload it from different areas of the grid and it supposed to be managed in this way like any network that you're trying to manage to peak efficiency so what does it mean up exactly there's this it's a private it's private corporations and what are these companies what do they make who are they make up the grid so the biggest one is called PJM which it's started the 1920s is like a voluntary reliability group it stands for Pennsylvania Jersey Maryland but today it stretches from Illinois to the mid-atlantic coast of the United States including Washington they've got oligopoly on the grid right and price to get Oleg ah Polly pricing on the grid so it's it's a it's a private membership based corporation but they are officially sort of acting like an umpire the problem is is that they are highly susceptible to influence by some of their powerful members and in this case the powerful members are some of the big owners of generation the largest generation owner in PJM for example is a Chicago based corporation called exelon and exelon owns a huge fleet of aging on economic nuclear reactor they do during hurricane Harvey and Erma well in New England one big nuclear reactor was forced to go offline historically nuclear power plants aren't super reliable during big stress events involving extreme weather we saw during the recent hurricanes a number of the nuclear power plants had to go offline as a precaution because as we saw with Fukushima and Japan you have to have an on-site power system to run all the cooling systems to keep that nuclear reaction stable if you lose access to the grid it's very risky to run only on that separate on-site power so as a precaution during big weather events nuclear power plants often go offline okay that's good energy conversation I want to continue you can stay I can okay good that's gonna do it for this edition of the Kaiser report with me max Kaiser it's Daisy Herbert like to thank our guest the one and only tyson slocum from the public citizen's energy program gonna catch us on twitter it's Kaiser report till next time bye yo you
