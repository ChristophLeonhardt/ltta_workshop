Cynthia Nixon and Andrew Cuomo engaged in a debate the one and only debate for the gubernatorial race in the state of New York and they spoke about a number of different issues but the topic that really piqued my interest was that of money in politics now Cuomo had some fascinating things to say about money in politics let's here here's my ethics plan no outside income period period full financial disclosure and campaign finance reform because we have to take the money out of politics it's that simple okay we need to take the money out of politics it's that simple just recently The Young Turks reported on a story that David Sirota broke by the way indicating that Cuomo decided to drop an investigation into prosecutors in the state of New York who refused to file charges against Harvey Weinstein an Italian model had accused him Harvey Weinstein of sexual assault she provided evidence of that sexual assault in the form of a recording and prosecutors decided not to investigate or to press charges so when that story broke Cuomo was like this is this is out of control we need to investigate the prosecutors and figure out what happened Cuomo then received $25,000 in campaign donations from the law firm representing Harvey Weinstein at the time and soon decided to drop the investigation into these prosecutors I'm mentioning that because Cuomo gave us some proof that he himself is a very corrupt politician $25,000 was all it took for him to drop that investigation into these prosecutors who refused to file the charges just think that that context is important considering what he had just said in that to be and that's actually what's very disappointing is you were pointing out to the fact that it's only 25 thousand dollars will bring a politician who is so married to corporate culture to his knees that's what's stunning to me and I think the other thing that Cynthia Nixon also focused in on and she got flack from traditional media because they didn't understand what she was really pointing towards was her focus in on how he handled MTA and she says basic is his atm and he completely in a very corrupt way messed up the necessary changes to the MTA and there's gonna be a fee high coming soon but there is no change to the service they're operating on 100-year old system and it's because Cuomo the MTA received some money from the state took that money that was supposed to go to the MTA and redirected it to other sort of things that he was more interested in putting money towards aka more of his corporate donors oh yeah they're no big they're no big changes structurally under a Cuomo administration it's going to be you know what you see is what you get I mean he is married to the corporate structure he's a corporatist all the way but I love how he whips out that talking point like he really believes it it's very well we gotta get money out of politics yeah we do and then not becoming well-rehearsed talking point and he does so much damage by using it as a talking point because money in politics is such a serious issue corruption legalized bribery in politics is a serious issue if you hear it being used by politicians like Cuomo I just worry that Americans might get fatigued from hearing it and they'll it'll trigger something that'll make them think that it's nothing more than a talking point but for a lot of politicians like Cynthia Nixon who refuses to take corporate PAC money this is a real issue that she feels strongly about and you know before we continue the conversation I do want you guys to hear her response to Cuomo take a look campaign finance reform is something that Governor Cuomo has been promising ever since he ran in 2010 it's not hard to know how to do campaign finance reform it's to close the LLC loophole by which corporations can donate an unlimited amount of money to political campaigns but since taking office Governor Cuomo has received 16 million dollars through the LLC loophole that's more than every single legislator in Albany combined so she called him out and as I mentioned earlier I mean he has been receiving these campaign donations just recently twenty-five thousand dollars from a law firm representing Harvey Weinstein previously representing Harvey can I also just make a point I know you're gonna get angry with me for this but the the sign language thing I feel like we're with closed captions can't we now get past the sign language thing or not that's interesting I just thought I just I was so surprised because I normally I'll watch things a closed caption if it's a little bit hard to watch things with yeah so I'm so I'm I'm used to seeing it so to see the sign language is just a little odd yeah she did a great thing she did a total reversal there where she won that point so if you look at a debate and you're scoring it I mean that's a TKO right he comes through with the talking point and as Anna says you hope it's not just a talking point but in his case it is just a talking point because he's made no changes to campaign money but she comes through with specifics here's how easily you could have changed things and and so I think at the end of that exchange Cuomo has just left flat-footed well you know to your point about whether or not people will get fatigued hearing campaign finance reform maybe that could be coded as a talking point versus outwardly saying and explicitly saying I do not take money from corporations because that higher standard is something that we need to put back into the debate circuit right because then how would he respond to that have you taken money from corporations yeah you cannot that's the only thing actually that was missing in that exchange was that which is well sir have you taken and in the response yeah I mean she did call him out on how much she's expecting how much he has accepted since becoming governor of New York the response I think is look I act within the law I should the law be changed yes I'd like to be part of changing that law but I act but within the law so I don't know that you get you get much if you call them out that way but but yes but no I'm just gonna say you make the great point which is where it's a great brag I mean it's the brag the of the new politics which is I don't take corporate money right and also I think maybe a couple years ago it would seem impossible for someone to win an election against an incumbent without taking corporate PAC money because it puts you at such a significant disadvantage but now all of a sudden we're seeing progressive candidates who have rejected corporate PAC money winning elections and aoc Alexandria Cosmo Cortes is just one example and so it is a powerful message I think that it sits well with voters but more importantly there is evidence of it working you know you can win without you know going along with the status quo and and I love that I love seeing that right Matt Taibbi wrote this great article for Rolling Stone about this debate saying this is a preview of Democrats versus Democratic socialists of America and I think that's also how we need to assess the situation is this is gonna be the start of many more as aoc as Andrew Gilliam was the start of many more and so he also made the point that she probably could have attacked him harder when it came to receiving corporate donations and that's something he would have loved to see more of even though the media I mean traditional media's take on this which we haven't even discussed was fascinating their whole focus was the fact that he and that Cuomo announced he wasn't gonna run in 2020 and that was it yeah they were like that the big surprise it's amazing it really is I mean in in order to actually get a sense of what happened in the debate you have to sit there watch the full debate and you should especially if you're a New Yorker please this is an important race pay close attention there are real policy issues at hand that impact you impact your life on a daily basis and even though based on the last poll that was done there's a huge gap between Cuomo and Cynthia Nixon who knows if you get more people energized to go out there and vote if you pay closer attention there's a possibility that she could win want to see more videos like this well you can all you have to do is subscribe to the TYT
