I was seven years old 
and we had driven overnight.
I had no idea 
what to expect
and it was really boring 
for a long time.
But then all of a sudden 
you're plunged into darkness
and you see 
the corona come out
and it's just, 
it's like nothing else
on earth. 
And I was just hooked.
This is just a 
tremendous opportunity
for scientific research. 
We're learning
not only how the sun shines 
but since the sun
is an example 
of a certain type of star
–that is widespread 
in the universe–
we're learning 
about billions
and trillions 
of other stars.
The eclipses 
are all different
because they're in
different places,
different times 
every year.
So at Svalbard in March, 
for instance,
was frostbitten feet 
and marching up
for polar bears, 
but totality itself,
assuming you're not 
clouded out,
it's just an 
overwhelming,
powerful experience
no matter where.
It's short, 
it's powerful.
Just put down 
the camera and enjoy.
