00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,510
former US Attorney Preet Bharara now
says he believes President Trump would

2
00:00:03,510 --> 00:00:06,540
have asked him to do something
inappropriate if he had not been fired

3
00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:10,139
Barrera was let go in March along with
45 other US attorneys appointed by

4
00:00:10,139 --> 00:00:14,429
President Obama while not unusual for
presidents to ask holdover attorneys to

5
00:00:14,429 --> 00:00:18,690
go the move was shocking to Barrera and
observers Ferrara had said that the

6
00:00:18,690 --> 00:00:21,330
President had personally told him that
he wanted him to stay

7
00:00:21,330 --> 00:00:24,779
Ferrara has since become a vocal critic
of the president he joins us now for his

8
00:00:24,779 --> 00:00:29,429
first appearance as a CNN senior legal
analyst preper ara thanks so much for

9
00:00:29,429 --> 00:00:33,000
joining us good to have you as part of
the team so the first question I have

10
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,989
for you is you expressed concern that
President Trump would have asked you to

11
00:00:36,989 --> 00:00:39,899
do something inappropriate that's a
strong charge to make what exactly do

12
00:00:39,899 --> 00:00:43,410
you think he might have asked you to do
it's not a charge it's just my belief

13
00:00:43,410 --> 00:00:46,860
from my perspective based on what
happened over time and based on what

14
00:00:46,860 --> 00:00:50,430
I've observed he has said to other
people among other things as we all know

15
00:00:50,430 --> 00:00:55,199
in the public record and I credit this
he had a private meeting with Jim Comey

16
00:00:55,199 --> 00:00:58,829
after he told two other people including
his Attorney General to leave the room

17
00:00:58,829 --> 00:01:03,120
and told him essentially to lay off the
investigation of Michael Flynn we now

18
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:06,540
know some weeks later that at one point
he talked to his own attorney general

19
00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:09,390
Jeff Sessions and suggested is there
something we can do

20
00:01:09,390 --> 00:01:13,200
to back off on the case against the
sheriff in Arizona Joe Arpaio those are

21
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:17,130
two bits of evidence and then we have
from my own experience the President of

22
00:01:17,130 --> 00:01:20,070
the United States both as president
elect and then as president calling me

23
00:01:20,070 --> 00:01:24,450
on the phone a number of times which is
unprecedented unusual the number of

24
00:01:24,450 --> 00:01:29,820
times Barack Obama called me in seven
and a half years was zero to have a

25
00:01:29,820 --> 00:01:33,180
chitchat conversation I'm not saying
it's a certainty but I'm saying based on

26
00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:37,170
what I know and based on the oddity of
being called on a repeated basis and

27
00:01:37,170 --> 00:01:40,140
based on what happened with these other
two gentlemen Jim Comey and Jeff

28
00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:43,500
Sessions that at some point I believe he
would have asked me to do something

29
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:46,770
inappropriate any ideas of what he might
have asked you to do one does I

30
00:01:46,770 --> 00:01:49,079
bethought I'm not going to speculate but
there's a lot of things that are

31
00:01:49,079 --> 00:01:51,540
swirling around in the world so a
Special Counsel Robert roller has

32
00:01:51,540 --> 00:01:55,229
requested extensive records and email
correspondence from the White House

33
00:01:55,229 --> 00:01:58,140
including records relating to the
president's discussions about firing

34
00:01:58,140 --> 00:02:00,540
Comey
his response to news that his former

35
00:02:00,540 --> 00:02:05,100
national security adviser was under
investigation I am NOT a lawyer but I

36
00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:11,250
can't think of anything this would mean
other than Robert Muller is at least

37
00:02:11,250 --> 00:02:15,780
trying to figure out if there is enough
evidence for a charge against the

38
00:02:15,780 --> 00:02:21,240
president of obstruction of justice am I
wrong so I am a lawyer and now I get to

39
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:26,790
play one on TV yeah so that's great look
I think everything you see from our

40
00:02:26,790 --> 00:02:29,820
armchair seats
suggests that Robert Muller is gonna

41
00:02:29,820 --> 00:02:33,320
chase down everything that might suggest
a crime has been committed by any

42
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:37,800
associate colleague relative of the
president and also the President himself

43
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:41,910
that does not mean that there will be a
referral to the House of Representatives

44
00:02:41,910 --> 00:02:45,570
for impeachment that does not mean
there's gonna be a charge against anyone

45
00:02:45,570 --> 00:02:49,740
but I think Bob muddler based on my
knowledge of him and based on I think

46
00:02:49,740 --> 00:02:54,000
what his lifetime of service as a
prosecutor as an FBI director indicates

47
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,850
is that he's gonna look at everything
and one of the obstruction

48
00:02:56,850 --> 00:03:00,150
I think clearly one of the things he's
going to be looking at is obstruction I

49
00:03:00,150 --> 00:03:04,530
think any prosecutor or investigator who
sees the evidence that has come forward

50
00:03:04,530 --> 00:03:07,980
including the firing of Jim Comey
including the conversations about how

51
00:03:07,980 --> 00:03:11,250
much the President did not like the
Russia investigation including what he

52
00:03:11,250 --> 00:03:15,450
said about Michael Flynn all of that
together paints a picture of potential

53
00:03:15,450 --> 00:03:20,400
obstruction and Bob Muller is a thorough
and and serious person and fearless and

54
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:23,910
I think he's got to go there so help me
out with this part of it

55
00:03:23,910 --> 00:03:27,870
CNN's Pamela brown reported that as part
of the investigation Muller interviewed

56
00:03:27,870 --> 00:03:33,560
Deputy Attorney General rod Rosenstein
about his role in trumps firing of Comey

57
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:37,890
Rosenstein also oversees Muller
that's obviously because the Attorney

58
00:03:37,890 --> 00:03:42,090
General had to recuse himself for other
reasons do you have any concerns about

59
00:03:42,090 --> 00:03:48,270
the person overseeing the investigation
also being a witness potentially to

60
00:03:48,270 --> 00:03:52,500
possible crimes committed that Muller is
looking into doesn't that seem like a

61
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:56,430
huge conflict of interest
it seems odd you know there's been a lot

62
00:03:56,430 --> 00:04:00,570
of controversy on in the mind of the
president about Jeff Sessions recusing

63
00:04:00,570 --> 00:04:03,570
himself he said repeatedly that had he
known Jeff Sessions was gonna recuse

64
00:04:03,570 --> 00:04:06,660
himself he wouldn't have appointed him
the Attorney General but now we have I

65
00:04:06,660 --> 00:04:11,730
think you're right it's it's odd and
unusual that a person who is putative ly

66
00:04:11,730 --> 00:04:15,840
overseeing the investigation also is a
witness we also know for example and I

67
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:17,910
know I know rod and I think he's a good
person

68
00:04:17,910 --> 00:04:21,810
we were colleagues together as US
attorneys but we do know that he had

69
00:04:21,810 --> 00:04:26,370
some role in putting forth what I think
most people think was a pretextual basis

70
00:04:26,370 --> 00:04:29,430
for the firing of Jim
to the extent that an obstruction

71
00:04:29,430 --> 00:04:33,150
investigation relies a little bit on the
facts relating to the firing of Jim

72
00:04:33,150 --> 00:04:37,259
Comey it would seem that there's a
conflict what what I think people should

73
00:04:37,259 --> 00:04:41,729
want to know is whether or not like Jeff
Sessions the Deputy Attorney General rod

74
00:04:41,729 --> 00:04:45,479
Rosen Stein has consulted with the top
ethics advisors in the department and

75
00:04:45,479 --> 00:04:49,289
gotten clearance to continue and if not
then he shouldn't

76
00:04:49,289 --> 00:04:52,949
all right Preet Bharara thank you so
much we have a lot more to discuss about

77
00:04:52,949 --> 00:04:56,759
this and I'm glad you're on board now
we'll have you on a lot to talk about it

78
00:04:56,759 --> 00:00:00,000
thank you so much
