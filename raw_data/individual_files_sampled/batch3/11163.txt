US military drills with South Korea which Donald Trump surprisingly canceled following the North Korea summit in Singapore are back on the table as you know we took the step to suspend several of the largest exercises as a good-faith measure coming out of the Singapore summit we have no plans at this time to suspend any more exercises north korea has repeatedly said the military games were a provocation targeting the country Trump's decision though caused concern in South Korea while the president seemed to imply all drills were halted that may not have been the case we will be stopping the war games which will save us a tremendous amount of money unless and until we see that the future negotiation is not going along like it should we suspended several of the largest exercises but we did not suspend the rest so there are ongoing exercises all the time on the peninsula the reason you've not heard much about them is North Korea could not in any way misinterpret those as somehow breaking faith with the negotiation joined by the director of the Occident based Crisis Research Institute mark Alyn thanks for joining us sir good to have you on Trump has said he was going to halt all the games didn t but Malthus seems to imply they have been running all along what's the situation here exactly how what will this lead to well I think what it's really about is as you'll remember Mike Pompeo the US Secretary was supposed to go in the last few days to North Korea in order to carry on the negotiations I mean if you like to bring something concrete back to Washington some indication that the North Koreans were actually going to denuclearize as the Americans say and that hasn't happened Trump canceled his meeting and I think Trump in a sense is reverting to his pressure tactics if you remember we might have thought a year ago that we were on the to a war with North Korea as it was beginning to test very long-range missiles as well as nuclear warheads and then we had the dramatic sunshine policy from Washington where President Trump as well as South Korean president met Kim Young Lil Kim omen and seemed to be able to personally negotiate some kind of track towards a reconciliation of this problem and so I think in a sense feeling that the North Koreans have not been moving as rapidly in the direction of disarmament as Trump would want to perhaps Trump exaggerated the degree to which North Korea would disarm without steps by the United States to match it step by step to to remove American forces American nuclear forces I mean Trump's rhetoric after that summit was so positive he said it's been so successful so many steps forward he did say the games would be restarted if the negotiations failed so is this what we're seeing a view that negotiations have been futile well I think what he's saying is you better show me some steps which I can then say we're moving in the right direction he's putting pressure on North Korea he's also in a sense putting pressure on South Korea because of course the South Korean president is due to meet kim jung-eun in in september South Korea wants to open a liaison office on the border at once in a way probably to regenerate new economic contacts and so the warming of relations between South Korea and North Korea has been a sense a positive aspect of Trump's diplomacy but now of course it begins to erase the question of a split possibly the Trump will want to go back to a more aggressive posture to pressure North Korea and the South Korean government may say we have perceived benefits from a calming of the atmosphere and improvement of the atmosphere there's also of course the issue of countries like Russia and particularly China who are essential to the u.s. strategy of sanction in North Korea Russia and China voted for the UN sanctions and if China for instance feels under pressure from America over its trade policy or then it may not be so helpful to Trump so the issue is becoming more more complicated you
