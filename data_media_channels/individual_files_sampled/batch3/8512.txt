REPUBLICANS. THEN PICKED UP IMPORTANT THING WAS PICKED UP BY DEMOCRATS OPPOSED TO DONALD TRUMP. Judge: JOINING US NOW FOR REACTION IS FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR HERMAN CAIN AND FLORIDA CONGRESSMAN MATT GAETZ. ALL RIGHT, CONGRESSMAN, I'M GOING TO ASK YOU FIRST. WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THIS NEW REPORT BY THE INTEL COMMITTEE, THE REPUBLICAN MAJORITY, ACTUALLY? WELL, THIS REPORT IS A DECISIVE WIN FOR THE PRESIDENT BECAUSE IT SUPPORTS WHAT THE PRESIDENT HAS BEEN SAYING ALL ALONG. AND THAT IS THAT RUSSIANS HAD A GREATER INVOLVEMENT GLAFTING. HILLARY CLINTON FUNDED CHRISTOPHER STEELE AUTHORED DOSSIER THAN THEY EVER HAD WITH THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN. NO EVIDENCE OF COLLUSION STILL AND FRANKLY JUDGE JEANINE, THIS POINTS OUT THE NEED TO DISBAND THE MUELLER INVESTIGATION BECAUSE IT'S BUILT ON A ROTTEN PREMISE THAT HAS NOW BEEN DISPROVEN WITH 250 PAGES OF FACT. Judge: ALL RIGHT. AND HERMAN CAIN TO YOU, THAT WHAT IS YOUR TAKE ON THIS LATEST REPORT FROM THE INTEL COMMITTEE? MY TAKE, JUDGE JEANINE, IS THAT HE IS NOT IN HOT WATER. HE LIED AND LIED AND LIED. Judge: COMEY? AND NOW WE HAVE TO WAIT FOR THE PROCESS TO PLAY ITSELF OUT. COMEY I'M TALKING ABOUT. WE NOW HAVE TO WAIT FOR THE PROCESS TO PLAY ITSELF OUT FOR HIM TO END UP IN COURT SUCH THAT A COURT JUDGMENT PROVES THAT HE LIED AND TRIED TO KEEP A CLOUD OVER THIS ADMINISTRATION. HE AND OTHERS HAVE TRIED TO KEEP A CLOUD OVER THIS ADMINISTRATION BUT WITH THIS REPORT, THE CLOUDS HAVE PARTED AND NOW WE'RE SEEING THE TRUTH AND THAT'S WHAT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE WANTED TO SEE. Judge: YOU KNOW, WHAT'S INTERESTING, HERMAN, IS THAT EVEN THOUGH YOU SAY THAT WE WANT TO SEE THE COURTS GET INVOLVED. THE TRUTH IS THAT THE INSPECTOR GENERAL'S REPORT WAS SUPPOSED TO COME OUT IN APRIL REGARDING COMEY. NOW THEY SAY MAY. AND PROBABLY EVEN LATER THAN THAT. CHRISTOPHER STEELE, THERE WAS A REFERENCE BECAUSE HE LIED TO THE FBI. I BELIEVE WAS CHAIRMAN GRASSLEY'S COMMITTEE WHO MADE A CRIMINAL REFERRAL TO THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE MONTHS AND MONTHS AGO, NOTHING HAS HAPPENED. WE KNEW MCCABE LIED OVER MORE THAN SEVERAL MONTHS AGO. NOTHING HAS HAPPENED. WHAT DO YOU THINK IT'S GOING TO TAKE? I THINK THEY ARE SLOW-WALKING THE DOCUMENTS WE DON'T HAVE THE EVIDENCE. SO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE GET PAST 2018, CHANGE THE HOUSE. I ABSOLUTELY AGREE WITH YOU. THEY ARE TRYING TO SLOW-WALK THIS CLOUD. SLOW WALK THESE INVESTIGATIONS. SUCH THAT THEY GET THROUGH NOVEMBER 2018. BUT HERE'S THE THING, JUDGE JEANINE. THE AMERICAN PEOPLE, INCLUDING SOME DEMOCRATS, ARE NOT STUPID. WE HAVE HAD ENOUGH EVIDENCE COME OUT EVEN THROUGH THE MEDIA THAT SAYS HE HAS LIED AND DISCREDITED HIMSELF AND THEY'RE NOT GOING TO SWALLOW THE GULLABLE LIES THAT THE DEMOCRATS AND THE LIBERALS ARE TRYING TO PUSH ON THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. THEY WON'T BE ABLE TO SLOW WALK THIS ONE. BECAUSE WHEN AN AG REPORT COMES OUT. IT'S GOING TO BE THE ICING ON THE CAKE. CONGRESSMAN GATES YOU ENDED BY SAYING YOUR LAST COMMENT THAT IT'S TIME FOR THE SPECIAL COUNSEL MUELLER'S GROUP TO BE DISBANDED. BUT, TODAY, OR YESTERDAY, I BELIEVE IT WAS CHAIRMAN GRASSLEY OF THE SENATE JUDICIARY WHO LET A BILL OUT OF COMMITTEE SUPPORTED BY A FEW REPUBLICANS LIKE LINDSEY GRAHAM SAYING THEY ARE GOING TO BLOCK THE PRESIDENT FROM FIRING MUELLER AND DISBANDING THE COMMISSION. I MEAN, ON THE ONE HAND WE HAVE YOU SAYING ONE THING AND GRASSLEY SAYING ANOTHER. WHY IS GRASSLEY WASTING HIS TIME WITH THIS KIND OF A BILL. WELL, SENATOR GRASSLEY HAS DONE A LOT TO CONTRIBUTE TO OUR INVESTIGATION OF THE
