Donald Trump's visit<font color="#CCCCCC"> to Saudi Arabia</font>

2
00:00:05,759 --> 00:00:07,859
earlier this year seemed unprecedented

3
00:00:07,859 --> 00:00:10,559
they were I<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't know almost 50</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Arab</font>

4
00:00:10,559 --> 00:00:12,330
nations gathered together<font color="#CCCCCC"> their Trump</font>

5
00:00:12,330 --> 00:00:14,610
very clearly<font color="#E5E5E5"> called on them to repudiate</font>

6
00:00:14,610 --> 00:00:17,670
I think his words were radical Islamic

7
00:00:17,670 --> 00:00:19,439
terrorism I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think that's how</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> he phrased</font>

8
00:00:19,439 --> 00:00:22,800
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> and and they applauded him and and it</font>

9
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:24,539
looked like<font color="#E5E5E5"> some</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sort of reorientation</font>

10
00:00:24,539 --> 00:00:26,970
perhaps the Sunni Arabs<font color="#E5E5E5"> joining together</font>

11
00:00:26,970 --> 00:00:28,980
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> preserve themselves against Iran</font>

12
00:00:28,980 --> 00:00:31,439
there seemed to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be a warming</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of Arabs</font>

13
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:34,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">towards Israel did this derail that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> or</font>

14
00:00:34,950 --> 00:00:38,190
was this part of<font color="#E5E5E5"> that this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is part of</font>

15
00:00:38,190 --> 00:00:40,320
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you take the point of view</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

16
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:42,360
<font color="#CCCCCC">the status of perhaps the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> most important</font>

17
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:47,370
of the Sunni Arab states the<font color="#E5E5E5"> the goal</font>

18
00:00:47,370 --> 00:00:50,520
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> the worry is the Islamic Republic</font>

19
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:53,399
of Iran<font color="#E5E5E5"> in large part because of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Obama's</font>

20
00:00:53,399 --> 00:00:53,940
<font color="#CCCCCC">Araki</font>

21
00:00:53,940 --> 00:00:56,699
and so you're looking<font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> allies you're</font>

22
00:00:56,699 --> 00:00:59,489
looking for strength<font color="#CCCCCC"> and who in the</font>

23
00:00:59,489 --> 00:01:02,609
<font color="#E5E5E5">region is reliable and strong Israel so</font>

24
00:01:02,609 --> 00:01:03,899
you would like to<font color="#E5E5E5"> work with this room</font>

25
00:01:03,899 --> 00:01:06,930
but for<font color="#CCCCCC"> a variety of reasons the</font>

26
00:01:06,930 --> 00:01:09,390
<font color="#CCCCCC">continuing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Palestinian issue remains</font>

27
00:01:09,390 --> 00:01:12,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">something that's a problem and so</font>

28
00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:13,650
therefore you'd like to dispatch this

29
00:01:13,650 --> 00:01:15,030
you'd like to put it to the side you'd

30
00:01:15,030 --> 00:01:16,830
like ideally resolve it but in any<font color="#E5E5E5"> case</font>

31
00:01:16,830 --> 00:01:19,439
you don't want<font color="#CCCCCC"> it to be in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> front of and</font>

32
00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:23,100
so having the US government take a

33
00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:25,530
strong stand and push to the

34
00:01:25,530 --> 00:01:28,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">Palestinians to the side and say yeah</font>

35
00:01:28,350 --> 00:01:30,240
this is not our you you are not our

36
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:32,579
priority is in the end rather<font color="#E5E5E5"> helpful</font>

37
00:01:32,579 --> 00:01:35,280
<font color="#CCCCCC">for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the Saudis and the others yes there</font>

38
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:38,520
was this firestorm<font color="#CCCCCC"> over the embassy</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

39
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:42,030
the UN on some streets<font color="#CCCCCC"> but overall</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font>

40
00:01:42,030 --> 00:01:43,979
sending<font color="#E5E5E5"> a strong signal to the</font>

41
00:01:43,979 --> 00:01:46,140
Palestinians<font color="#CCCCCC"> you are not our priority</font>

42
00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:48,299
you are not what's<font color="#E5E5E5"> gonna stop this cold</font>
