when love is the way then no cow will go to bed hungry in this world ever again in love is the way poverty will become history when the huff is the way the earth will be a sanctuary dr. King was right we must discover love the redemptive power of love so what are you flagged a column by EJ Dionne in The Washington Post and it's it's about Christian leaders who are calling out what they're calling the heresy of trumpism and it's been led in large part by the Reverend Michael Curry who we just heard their preaching of course for the royal couple this past weekend now today a group of Christians are going to be marching on the White House for a candlelight vigil and they've released a joy declaration about the quote dangerous crisis of moral and political leadership at the highest levels of our government the opening paragraph reads quote we believe the soul of the nation and the integrity of faith are now at stake let's bring in Pulitzer prize-winning historian Jon Meacham he's the author of the new best-selling book the soul of America the battle for our better angels and John we'll get you in one moment but Eddie there's a great find with ejs column because it does appear that there are some evangelical leaders that are willing that well the paraphrase Jesus to be the salt and the light of this world yeah Joe they they are exemplifying what you've been talking about on this show for a while and those are those Matthew 25 Christians and so here we have Bishop Currie and Jim Wallace of sojourners organizing a candlelight vigil on the White House in order to suggest that the way in which Trump has and and some evangelicals who support Trump have enlisted drafted Jesus and his ministry to support his policies to support his mean-spiritedness actually represents in some ways a kind of idolatry and they want to put forward a vision of Jesus a vision of Christianity that is really concerned with the least of these this really concerns with concern with matters of justice love because in fact love justice is what love looks like in public as a good friend of mine would say so this is going to be a wonderful moment tonight I think it's a wonderful example of the diversity of American Christendom and there's an attempt by some to really take back right a certain understanding of what it means to bear witness to Jesus's sacrifice yeah John me some of course there always gonna be disagreements in every faith community on policy we may have disagreements on tax policy we may have disagreement on immigration policy protecting the borders fighting wars that's understandable what what is not understandable is the complete segregation between character and leadership which evangelical leaders had always tried to bind together and certainly let us know during the Clinton administration that you could not have a viable leadership without strong character now you have many of these same people and I'll just start with Franklin Graham who wrote long op-eds attacking Bill Clinton's moral failings now saying that Donald Trump's personality his is hatefulness the fact that his very life that he exemplifies actually undermines every one of the Beatitudes and if you don't believe me go to Jesus's Sermon on the Mount every one of the Beatitudes his life seems to be the antithesis of it and John I'm just never known it in the history of the evangelical movement any evangelical leaders taking this position well it's a to me it's a fascinating moment brings up you know what what profited a man to gain the whole world if you if you lose your soul the the broad evangelical movement as we're describing in basically has made a really shrewd political bet but it is a political bet they are playing a 40-year strategy at the expense of their integrity for four years they they're supporting President Trump for the Supreme Court for the judiciary and they want to get these young appointees they want to get them for decades and they're willing to really put their otherwise consistent views aside for that purpose and I think Eddie is exactly the right word it's a dollar tree it's it's putting a temporal force temporal advantage ahead of spiritual integrity and look I'm Robert Lewis teams and once said the duty of the Christian is not to succeed but to fail cheerfully and that's me I'm the most cheerful Christian therefore you'll ever see because I fail all the time and so I hesitate to cast the first stone here but they are in the arena they put themselves out there and I think that ultimately they will have to have a reckoning about this well not not to not to turn this into a theological discussion or a race to the bottom on that who sends the most but I think I win that I will admit that you can defer to me thank you so much John so kind of you again for again and well we're talking about this only so people who aren't evangelicals can understand that at the base of our faith is the belief that all have sinned and fallen short of the glory of God none of us deserve God's love or God's grace it's only when we understand that and we come before God humbly begging for forgiveness every day because we will always fail it is only then that we are worthy of being called a Christian and yet the evangelicals are worshipping a man supporting a man following a man who has literally said I don't need to be forgiven by God I've never asked God for forgiveness I try to be good and there's nothing I need to ask forgiveness for this is the is the antithesis of what evangelicals are taught from the time they are three years old absolutely Joe and what this is what happens when you when you emphasize the kind of how can we put this when your court profits right when you're comfortable in the temple and understanding in some ways Jesus's ministry as in some ways a challenge to those who claim to hold the gospel to hold the truth for themselves and so what I see sojourners when I see Bishop curry and other evangelical Christians doing right it's making a claim on the gospel making a claim on what it means to be Christian and placing that squarely against what others are doing in their association with Donald Trump who seems by any measure Joe unchristian and that's kind of harsh but by any measure someone who falls short I mean I mean that seems to me obvious right and Joe you know I believe this is exactly the kind of discussion we ought to be having on this morning and many other mornings I mean Americans have always compartmentalized religion from politics and yet everyday politics and faith are on the front pages of our paper if you have faith in a political system you also have a private faith that you practice and if you look at the papers today you look at the topics we talk about immigration about the cutbacks and various programs aimed at helping the poor in this country the least among us that's faith that's religion that's it that's that well people live by yeah and again not nobody here can judge any other man or any other woman's faith we certainly can look at our evangelical leaders and see if they're acting like pharisees and sadducees and scribes and seeing whether they're more interested in chasing power than by remaining consistent with what they themselves have described as their beliefs through the years you know it's way above any of our pay grades to judge Donald Trump as a Christian but it's our job to look at what evangelical leaders are doing as it pertains to just a blind support Willie of a man who has again said that he has no need for God's forgiveness he has no need to pray for God's forgiveness and and again who acts everyday in a way that does great violence to the basic tenets of every single one of the Beatitudes that Jesus described in the sermon of the mount as what actually defines what being a Christian is and Joe remember we started asking these questions of faith leaders during the campaign faith leaders who supported President Trump and what do they always tell us we're trying to elect a president and not a saint they believe that he may not have been one of them but that he would protect them and protect their faith and we're seeing to John's point a political argument being made from the pulpit thanks for checking out MSNBC on YouTube and make sure you subscribe to stay
