>> STEVE: LAST NIGHT SATURDAY
NIGHT LIVE DIDN'T SURPRISE
ANYONE, OPENING UP THEIR SHOW
MOCKING PRESIDENT TRUMP AND
KANYE WEST.
>> SOME PEOPLE CALL IT CHAVEZ
BUT THE MURDER RATE IS GOING
DOWN 20% EVERY YEAR.
YOU SOON IT'S GOING TO BE A
NEGATIVE MURDER RIGHT.
WERE GOING TO BE TAKEN BODIES
OUT OF THE GROUND.
>> HE DOESN'T STOP.
HE DOESN'T LISTEN TO ANYONE BUT
HIMSELF.
LUNACY REMIND ME OF?
>> I DON'T WANT TO BREAK BUT I
HAVE A HIGH IQ.
I'M STABLE GENIUS.
I HAVE A BIG BRAIN.
>> OH MY GOD, HE'S BLACK ME.
>> STEVE: LET'S BRING IN OUR
COHOST OF THE FIVE AN AUTHOR OF
THE NEW BOOK, WHAT THE HELL DO
YOU HAVE TO LOSE.
OUR FRIENDS JUAN, LET'S HAVE A
HEATED DEBATE.
LET'S START WITH THE KANYE THING
IN MAKE SURE WE GET CLEAR ABOUT
WHAT YOUR BOOK IS ABOUT.
I THINK THE WAY KANYE WEST HAS
BEEN TREATED AND YOU KNOW I
TOTALLY DETEST RACISM WE'VE HAD
GOOD CONVERSATION ABOUT THAT IN
THE PAST.
I THINK THE WAY HE HAS BEEN
TREATED HAS BEEN RACIST.
HE'S BEEN SINGLED OUT FOR HIS
BELIEFS BECAUSE HE'S BLACK.
THAT HAS HAPPENED TO HIM FROM
THE LIBERAL COMMUNITY.
>> I DON'T THINK SO STEVE.
CLEARLY IF HE HAD US SPECIFIC
BELIEF OF SUBSTANCE OR AN
ARGUMENT TO BE MADE AND
ESPECIALLY A POPULACE ARGUMENT
BECAUSE I THINK THERE'S LOTS OF
BLACK PEOPLE WHO WANT THE KIND A
POPULACE RESPONSE THAT YOU
ADVOCATE BUT I DON'T KNOW WHAT
HIS AGENDA WAS.
I THOUGHT IT WAS A TROUBLING
SESSION.
USING PROFANITY, USING THE RED
MAKE MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN
WAS HIS SUPER HERO.
>> FIRST OF ALL, I THINK THERE
WAS REAL SUBSTANCE IN THERE.
HE TALKED ABOUT FAMILY
BREAKDOWN, BUSINESS AND
ENTREPRENEURSHIP.
I THOUGHT IT WAS REALLY SERIOUS.
WHEN YE USE WORDS LIKE TROUBLED
AND THAT THAT'S THE BIT THAT I
FIND PATRONIZING.
YOU SAY THE KEY HAS TO BE
MENTALLY ILL OTHERWISE YOU AND
HAVE A BLACK PERSON SUPPORTING
TRUMP.
>> I SAID HE, HE'S BEEN
HOSPITALIZED BY HIS OWN
ADMISSION, HE TALKS ABOUT
BIPOLAR DISORDER.
AFTER HE LEFT THE WHITE HOUSE HE
WENT OVER TO AN APPLE STORE, GOT
ON A TABLE AND STARTED RANTING.
YOU CAN UNDERSTAND WHY PEOPLE
SAY WHAT'S WITH THIS GUY.
I DON'T THINK THAT'S THE POINT.
I THINK THAT WOULD BE INSULTING
I THINK THE POINT IS THE
SUBSTANCE.
YOU THOUGHT HE WAS TALKING
ABOUT VIOLENCE, THIS IS PART
OF A DISTORTION.
TRUMP IS NOT TALKING TO THE
BLACK COMMUNITY EVEN WITH
KANYE WEST SITTING ACROSS TO
HIM.
HE'S TALKING TO WHITE
AMERICANS WHO SAY RACE
RELATIONS ARE WORSE UNDER THIS
PRESIDENT.
THEY DISAPPROVE OF HOW HE
HANDLES RACE.
HERE'S TRUMP SAYING I HAVE A
BLACK FRIEND, LOOK AT HIM, A
BLACK FRIEND IN A RED HAT,
DON'T WORRY ABOUT PEOPLE WHO
SAY I HAVE A PROBLEM WHETHER
IT'S WITH RACE OR
IMMIGRATION.
>> I THINK IT'S REALLY
OFFENSIVE.
LET'S GET TO IT IN A SECOND.
THEY BROUGHT IT OUT A BIT AND
TELL US THE ARGUMENT.
>> THE ARGUMENT IS HE WAS
SAYING THIS TO BLACK AMERICA
YOU LIVE IN BLACK AND AMERICAN
NEIGHBORHOODS THAT ARE MORE
VIOLENT THAN AFGHANISTAN, YOU
HAVE NO JOB, YOUR SCHOOLS ARE
TERRIBLE, YOUR STREETS ARE
FILLED WITH TRASH AND YOU BEEN
BOATING.
DEMOCRATS.
COME OVER TO MY SIDE AND VOTE
FOR ME.
I THINK HE WAS SPEAKING TO THE
WHITE PEOPLE COME HE NEVER
WENT TO A BLACK COMMUNITY TO
SAY THAT OR SPOKE TO A BLACK
CONVENTION ABOUT IT.
I THINK HE WAS SAYING I,
DONALD TRUMP AND NO SNOW
FLAKE.
I'M GOING TO POINT OUT THE
PROBLEMS OF THE BLACK
COMMUNITY AND FAITH THE THREAT
TO ALL OF US AND STAND UP
THERE AND RAPPEL IT.
HE DOESN'T TALK ABOUT MOST OF
BLACK AMERICA, CLEARLY.
>> BUT IT'S ALSO TRUE THAT AN
UNDENIABLE FACT THAT SO MUCH
OF THE DISADVANTAGE THAT HAS
HURT BLACK PEOPLE AND BLACK
FAMILIES HAS COME ABOUT AS A
RESULT OF POLICIES IN CONTROL
FOR DECADES BY THE DEMOCRATS.
>> I DON'T THINK IT'S GOOD TO
SEE MENTAL ILLNESS EXPLOITED
IN THAT WAY.
HE HAS TALKED ABOUT MENTAL
ILLNESS AND THERE HAS BEEN
SOME GOOD POINTS DISCUSSED,
BUT LET'S KEEP IT REAL IN THE
FIELD FOR THE PEOPLE WHO ARE
WATCHING.
THE SIMPLE FACT THAT HE WENT
AGAINST WHAT THE BLACK AGENDA
OR THE BLACK DELEGATION TOLD
US WE CAN AND CANNOT SAY,
ANYTIME YOU HAVE A
DISAGREEMENT OR AN OPINION
THAT'S DIFFERENT ON WHAT THE
DEMOCRATIC ESTABLISHMENT TELLS
YOU WHAT TO DO IT, YOU ARE
AUTOMATICALLY OSTRACIZED.
I'VE LOST MY CONTRACT BASED ON
WHAT I SAID AND ONE BEEN TOLD
HE WAS A SELLOUT.
I'VE BEEN TOLD THAT.
WE ARE NOT BIPOLAR.
LET'S ASK JUAN, ARE YOU
MENTALLY ILL QUEST MARK IS
THAT WHY PEOPLE DRAG YOU ALL
OVER TWITTER BECAUSE YOUR
BLACK?
IF YOU'RE BLACK AND HAVE A
DIFFERENT NOTE PINION OTHER
THAN WHAT THEY'RE TOLD YOU TO
SAY YOU GET OSTRACIZED.
I DON'T AGREE WITH KANYE
ANYMORE THAN I DID WITH
JAY-Z.
SAME BOOTS ARE BEING LICKED,
JUST A DIFFERENT PRESIDENT.
>> HOLD ON, WAIT, YOU.
MUCH SUMMED IT UP.
YOUR PASSION IS OBVIOUS.
WE WERE TALKING ABOUT THIS
BEFORE.
THE FACT THAT HE'S THERE AND
INSPIRING OTHER BLACK
AMERICANS TO COME OUT AND
SUPPORT WHO THEY WANT TO
SUPPORT, THE INDEPENDENT
ANCHORS, I THINK THAT'S GREAT
HOWEVER I THINK KANYE GOT WHAT
HE WANTED AND THAT'S THE
UNITED STATES TALKING ABOUT
KANYE WEST.
I DON'T KNOW WHY WE'RE STILL
TALKING ABOUT HIM.
I WISH WE ARE TALKING LESS
ABOUT THIS AND MORE ABOUT THE
ISSUES THAT IMPACT REAL
PEOPLE.
>> I WILL JUST SAY THAT
THERE'S A LOT OF AMERICANS WHO
DO NOT FIT IN A CONSERVATIVE
OR LIBERAL BOXES.
MY FEELING IS THEY TEND TO GET
LOCKED OUT OF OUR POLITICAL
CONVERSATION.
>> IS A REALLY GREAT BOOK BY
THE WAY AND EVERYONE CARES
ABOUT IMMIGRATION, YOU OUGHT
TO GET THIS BOOK.
IT'S SERIOUSLY GOOD.
THE IDEA OF ANNIHILATION, AND
THAT WE DON'T WANT TO EXIST
ALONG PEOPLE OF OTHER
POLITICAL OPINIONS, THE TRUTH
IS WE WILL ALWAYS HAVE THAT
DIVERSITY.
IT CAN BE A SOURCE OF STRENGTH
BUT WE NEED TO ACCEPT THAT AND
NOT STIGMATIZE IT OR DEMONIZE
IT.
>> WE HAVEN'T GOT MUCH TIME.
>> I WAS REALLY APPRECIATIVE
OF THAT COMMENT.
THERE WAS SUCH HYPOCRISY WHEN
YOU HEAR CONSERVATIVES
ABSOLUTELY THROWING THEIR ARMS
AROUND KANYE, KANYE WEST, THE
GUY WHO SAID GEORGE W. BUSH
DOESN'T CARE ABOUT BLACK
PEOPLE, BUT ALSO WENT KANYE,
JAY-Z AND OTHER RAPPERS CAME
TO THE WHITE HOUSE WITH OBAMA
THAT WOULD LIKE THESE GUYS ARE
THUGS THEY TALK ABOUT
GANGSTERS AND USE THE N WORD.
I THOUGHT BOY THIS IS CRAZY.
NOW THEY PUT THEIR ARMS AROUND
KANYE, OBVIOUSLY THIS IS
POLITICAL EXPEDIENCE.
IT'S NOT ABOUT SUBSTANCE.
THAT'S THE KEY.
I'M SOMEONE WHO DOES GET BEAT
UP BECAUSE I HAVE MY OWN
OPINION.
THEY ARE WHAT I THINK.
I WILL TELL YOU.
I DON'T TRY TO OBEY ANY
ORTHODOXY.
WHEN IT CAME TO KANYE, I DON'T
KNOW EXACTLY WHAT THE AGENDA
OR SUBSTANCE WAS OTHER THAN
PROMOTING KANYE AND TALKING
ABOUT HIS EGO AND HIS DESIRE
TO HAVE TRUMP AS A FATHER.
>> ALL RIGHT.
IT FELT TO ME LIKE THERE WAS
SERIOUS SUBSTANCE THERE.
>> LIKE WHAT.
NAME ONE THING.
>> ON FAMILY.
HANG ON.
ABSOLUTELY HE WAS.
HIS OWN FAMILY, NOT TO MENTION
EVERYONE ELSE'S, HOW MUCH THAT
HAS HURT HIM.
IT WAS DEEPLY EMOTIONAL.
THAT'S WHAT WE SHOULD BE
TALKING ABOUT IN POLITICS ON
WELFARE AND BUSINESS AND
ENTREPRENEURSHIP AND CRIME.
THESE ARE SERIOUS ISSUES.
>> HE WOULD'VE SAID THAT'S
GREAT.
HE DID NOT DO THAT.
