hi colleague Adi Schwartz he's in radio Island North Carolina it's it's literally four times as windy there at one point as I understand it got a you were experiencing roughly 60 mile-per-hour wind gusts is that still the case there yeah I get that Kestrel ready because this is this is what's coming your way Craig hi 61 miles at Beaufort which is right over there you see that line of trees that's both wound over there then we've got these dogs over here that are just taking a pounding you've got that dog flexing we've seen these stocks start to break apart again this is a 60 mile an hour maybe a little bit higher than 60 miles an hour but we're expecting twice as high winds as this right now you can imagine what that's going to be like that's gonna hit tonight and it's also gonna hit during the storm surge so not only are we gonna have these hurricane-force winds that are twice as strong as they are right now we're also gonna have this the ocean the sea come up we're expecting it to come up about seven feet seven and a half feet here which is unprecedented for this area of North Carolina the last time they had some really bad conditions like this was a hurricane in the 1950s and during that hurricane the storm surge got to about a six about six point nine four feet high this one is expected to be seven and a half feet so there are going to be areas the extreme flooding there's going to be areas that see a lot of that storm surge sweep in there are some businesses in town over here at Morehead City where they're talking about actually getting chainsaws and cutting open parts of of the floors so that that storm surge comes in and it doesn't rip apart some of those structures but this is an area that it's going to take a really bad it's gonna happen under the cover of darkness so as bad as the situation is right now situation is going to get a lot worse Craig all right gadi Schwartz there in Radio City got a do be careful sir gotti alluding to that hurricane back in the fifties that that one is still very much these storm that all of them have been compared to here in North Carolina Hurricane Hazel MSNBC's Garrett Haake is also on duty for us he is in New Bern North Carolina that town already fighting a battle with the Neuse River Garrett who's winning the battle right now Craig right now I'd say the town's probably fought it to a draw but this is what they have to compete against the Neuse River here this is a different scenario than on the coast here where our storm surge here at New Bern is going to come from the river itself not from the coast and the town is nestled up against the river on two sides and so what you have to deal with here is this storm surge that's going to come down the river as it rains and water comes down the storm surge pushing back up every little bit of rain we get and every little bit that that storm pushes closer will move more and more water here onto the street where I am on Front Street sort of the street where a lot of these historic homes come up against the water a lot of these residents have already left these are people who've lived here a long time they know what they're up against this is this home here's about 240 years old we were here when the owner was boarding it up he and his wife headed to Raleigh to ride this thing out they are absolutely not playing around with this storm some words of warning from the owner of this house Benjamin Bonnell we interviewed a little while ago take a listen nothing we can do here when winds get above three digits the only thing you can do inside your house is die you can't do anything else so correct we are seeing a lot of people here heed that evacuation warning when the category of storms seem to go down when it looked like the track was going to go further south some people said they were going to stay there's one gas station in town they said they were gonna stop selling gas to the Levin we saw a whole bunch of people get in line to get that last bit of gas and get out of here we're watching this water now all of this is with only about 45 minutes worth of rain so far this will pick up dramatically when the next rain band hits I think reg there are some who have said here in Wilmington that this city could end up getting roughly six seven months worth of rain in three days Garrett Haake Garrett Thank You dawn allen has lived here in Wilmington her entire life just about three miles away from where we stand right now Donna our husband have two kids you're not evacuating as I understand it correct that is correct yes sir why well it mainly it's financial reasons you know people have offered us free places to stay but it still takes gas money and food water everything else once you get there and then the fear of not knowing when you can get back home I've heard that from a number of people this this idea that even if they were able to get out that it might take one two if not longer maybe even three weeks to get back in yes sir that's exactly we've seen it happen with we had our hurricane two two years ago and it was not nearly this large of a system and it took people we can have to get back home so you can't afford to get out you're gonna hunker down what sort of precautions are you taking well we've got enough food and water to last at least a week and a half we've taped up our windows and have all our devices charged we have extra external battery packs and plenty of board games and cards for the kids to play put some water in the bathtub exactly boy water in the bathtub plenty of water filled up and jugs all over the place and how are the kids doing how are their how are their spirits are they getting stir-crazy yeah no not yet they still have their electronics so they're they're happy in there five on the iPad exactly there as long as they have their electronics they're happy and I'm like play with them as long as you can because once the power goes out that's it you're done it's it's interesting because over the last few days you've heard so many local official state officials national officials say get out get out get out and and you don't hear a lot of conversations being had about people who can't afford to get out exactly and that that is a real thing a lot I know more people who are staying than people who are left and you know I'm not the only one who has financial reasons you know I also have medical reasons I'm not leaving it's just it's a sad situation that so many are put in you have to pick whether you leave or you stay and you risk everything you know but we've been through storms before and thankfully this has been downgraded so you know there's still definitely danger out there but you know we're gonna ride it out be careful
