14
00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:31,080
thing I feel<font color="#E5E5E5"> like it's gotten so big and</font>

15
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:33,090
there's so many voices that harder and

16
00:00:33,090 --> 00:00:34,980
harder to make one-on-one connection

17
00:00:34,980 --> 00:00:36,690
with people so that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> what I'm going so</font>

18
00:00:36,690 --> 00:00:38,280
I want to talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> to y'all and look at</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> your</font>

20
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:42,750
nervous because my<font color="#E5E5E5"> friend making history</font>

21
00:00:42,750 --> 00:00:46,350
has<font color="#CCCCCC"> been a little rocky because I feel</font>

00:00:46,350 --> 00:00:47,730
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's kind of a truth of friendships</font>

that like the more that you just like

24
00:00:50,309 --> 00:00:52,890
want it and harder you try the<font color="#CCCCCC"> worst it</font>

25
00:00:52,890 --> 00:00:54,690
ends up going right when I was<font color="#E5E5E5"> in sixth</font>

26
00:00:54,690 --> 00:00:56,489
grade my parents didn't really<font color="#CCCCCC"> like the</font>

27
00:00:56,489 --> 00:00:58,230
teachers school<font color="#CCCCCC"> as that so they decided</font>

28
00:00:58,230 --> 00:00:59,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">to switch me to a different school and</font>

29
00:00:59,850 --> 00:01:01,859
I'd sometimes<font color="#E5E5E5"> my old school but like all</font>

30
00:01:01,859 --> 00:01:04,319
middle schoolers I just really wanted so

31
00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:07,439
badly to be cool<font color="#E5E5E5"> so when I started</font>

32
00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:08,790
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> grade</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and my new school</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

33
00:01:08,790 --> 00:01:12,840
like yes this is my chance I am gonna<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

34
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:15,320
so cool the boys are gonna like me

35
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:17,729
everything is gonna be great so I saved

36
00:01:17,729 --> 00:01:19,830
up my babysitting money about myself a

37
00:01:19,830 --> 00:01:21,920
few<font color="#E5E5E5"> Abercrombie t-shirts because that's</font>

38
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:24,780
literally all it took surprise lighting

39
00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:29,159
change and as soon as I rolled up in my

40
00:01:29,159 --> 00:01:32,759
like super tight little teal t-shirt

41
00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:35,650
with a rhinestone<font color="#CCCCCC"> mousse on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

42
00:01:35,650 --> 00:01:40,240
as in it worked for whatever reason that

43
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:43,390
<font color="#CCCCCC">was enough to buy me past with these</font>

44
00:01:43,390 --> 00:01:46,300
girls and they were so cool and they

45
00:01:46,300 --> 00:01:48,760
wore makeup and their parents let them

46
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:51,340
go<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the mall by themselves and they</font>

47
00:01:51,340 --> 00:01:53,560
let me start following them around then

48
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:55,330
I started wearing lip gloss and they

49
00:01:55,330 --> 00:01:57,550
liked me even more and I started

50
00:01:57,550 --> 00:01:59,590
straightening my hair and they liked me

51
00:01:59,590 --> 00:02:02,200
even more I was like after<font color="#CCCCCC"> all these</font>

52
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:05,470

<font color="#E5E5E5">Friendship first by the same things that</font>

54
00:02:08,979 --> 00:02:11,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">they buy and second when you get home</font>

55
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:16,360
after school you log on to aim and you

56
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:18,640
make one of other people with them boom

57
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:21,130
