>> ERIC: PRESIDENT TRUMPS
DECISION TO WITHDRAW FROM THE
IRANIAN NUCLEAR DEAL HAS SPARKED
ANGER AND REACTION IN TEHRAN.
THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE HAVE TAKEN
TO THE STREETS.
OFFICIALS IN IRAN REPORTEDLY
SAID THE COUNTRY WILL NOT
PREPARE FOR AN INDUSTRIAL SCALE
PRODUCTION OF NUCLEAR FUEL.
MEANWHILE, PRESIDENT TRUMP IS
EXPRESSING HOPE OF A NEW DEAL
BUT WITH TOUGHER CONDITIONS.
>> I HOPE TO BE ABLE TO MAKE A
DEAL WITH THEM.
A GOOD DEAL.
A FAIR DEAL.
A GOOD DEAL BETTER FOR THEM, BUT
WE CANNOT ALLOW THEM TO HAVE
NUCLEAR WEAPONS.
>> WERE JOINED BY DANNY, THE
ISRAELI INVESTOR TO THE UNITED
NATIONS.
WELCOME.
>> THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME.
>> HOW CONCERNED ARE YOU THAT
IRAN IS NOW SAYING THEY MAY
START NUCLEAR PRODUCTION OF SOME
SORT ON AN INDUSTRIAL SCALE?
>> NOTHING NEW.
WE KNEW ABOUT IT.
IT WAS EXPOSED A FEW WEEKS AGO.
WE SAW THEY BEEN TALKING ABOUT
IT AND PLANNING IT SO IT WAS A
BAD AGREEMENT.
WE'RE HAPPY THAT PRESIDENT TRUMP
PULLED OUT.
NOBODY CAN INSPECT ANYTHING, YOU
--
>> ERIC: THAT'S UNBELIEVABLE,
THAT TEHRAN HAS THE POWER TO
DECIDE WHETHER OR NOT
INTERNATIONAL INSPECTORS CAN GO
TO A MILITARY SITE.
WHAT ABOUT THE RESEARCH.
>> THAT'S A JOKE.
THE BALLISTIC MISSILE PROGRAM,
NOBODY SPOKE ABOUT IT.
THE THIRD ISSUE, THE EXPIRATION
DATE.
THIS IS THE CRUCIAL ISSUE.
WHAT HAPPENS IN SEVEN YEARS?
I THINK THEY'RE LYING.
BUT EVEN IF THEY'RE NOT, AND
SEVEN YEARS THEY COULD DO IT
THEY WANT.
MONEY.
THEY PROMOTE TERRORISM IN YEMEN,
LEBANON AND SYRIA.
>> ERIC: DO YOU THINK BECAUSE OF
THE SUNSET CLAUSE THEY'RE USING
THE FOR THE NEXT EIGHT YEARS TO
DEVELOP BALLISTIC MISSILES, AND
THEN MOVE INTO A NUCLEAR
PROGRAM?
>> ABSOLUTELY.
THERE 65000 PAGES OF OUR SECRET
SERVICE WAS ABLE TO OBTAIN, YOU
KNOW WHAT THE GOAL IS.
IT'S TO OBTAIN NUCLEAR WEAPONS.
TO USE BALLISTIC MISSILE TO
THREATEN THE REGION.
THAT'S WHY THE PRESIDENT WAS A
STRONG A BOLD MOVE.
>> ERIC: WHAT ABOUT THOSE WHO
SAY IT'S A DANGEROUS.
THAT THE PRESIDENT MADE THE
WRONG DECISION THAT WILL INFLAME
THE MIDDLE EASTERN CAUSE IRAN TO
HAVE A NUCLEAR WEAPON SOONER.
>> WHAT YOU THINK YOU HAVE TO
WAIT SEVEN YEARS AND THEN WAIT
FOR THE DECISION?
I THINK THE PRESIDENT SHOWED
LEADERSHIP AND WILL HELP HIM
NEGOTIATE A BETTER DEAL.
WHEN I SPEAK WITH MY CULLIGAN
THE UN, FROM OUR COUNTRY THEY
ARE GRATEFUL FOR THE LEADERSHIP
THERE SEEN.
>> IT'S AN AMAZING COALITION
BETWEEN SAUDI ARABIA IN YOUR
COUNTRY.
LEMMIE REACH YOUR TWEET THE
PRESIDENT TWEETED MOMENTS AGO.
HE SAID, IRAN'S MILITARY IS UP
MORE THAN 40% SINCE THE OBAMA
ADMINISTRATION NUCLEAR DEAL WAS
REACHED.
JUST ANOTHER INDICATOR IT WAS A
BIG LIE.
BUT NOT ANYMORE.
WITH THE WITHDRAW FROM THE
STILL, WHAT YOU EXPECT WILL
HAPPEN WITH TEHRAN?
DO THINK THIS WILL CAUSE ENOUGH
PRESSURE FOR TEHRAN TO FALL OR
THE HARDLINERS BE INVOLVED?
>> YOU WRITE ABOUT THE BUDGET,
NOT ONLY THE MILITARY BUDGET.
NOW MORE MONEY TO SEND THROUGH
THE PROXY.
THEY'RE PAYING SALARIES
AFGHANISTAN, -- SO NOW THEY'LL
START TO FEEL THE PRESSURE.
THEY'RE NOT HAPPY IN TEHRAN THIS
WEEK AND FOR GOOD REASON.
I THINK THEY HAVE TO DECIDE IF
THEY WILL CONTINUE WITH THE
AGREEMENTS WITH THE U.S. OR THE
IRANIANS.
I THINK EUROPEANS WILL HAVE TO
FOLLOW THE U.S.
>> ERIC: WE HAVEN'T A HISTORIC
DAY ON MONDAY.
WE WILL WANT TO TALK TO YOU
ABOUT THAT.
>> ARTHEL: ALSO IN THE HOLY
LAND, THE U.S. PREPARING TO OPEN
ITS NEW EMBASSY IN JERUSALEM ON
MONDAY WITH AT LEAST 50
DIPLOMATS EXPECTED TO STAFF THE
FACILITY WHEN THE DOORS OPEN.
THE MOVE COMES AS FIGHTING
INTENSIFIES ALONG THE ISRAELI IN
GAZA BORDER.
WE HAVE MORE FROM JERUSALEM.
>> IT'S BEEN A BUSY WEEK IN THE
MIDDLE EAST.
STARTING OFF WITH PRESIDENT
TRUMPS DECISION TO PULL OUT OF
THE IRAN DEAL.
FOLLOWED BY IRANIAN RECORDS
FIRED INTO ISRAEL AND THEN
ISRAEL'S RESPONSE.
NOW WE LOOK AHEAD TO THE MAJOR
OPENING OF THE EMBASSY IN
JERUSALEM.
OFFICIALS SAY THOUSANDS OF
OFFICERS WILL BE DEPLOYED TO
SECURE THE PERIMETER.
MANY OTHER GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS
FROM STATES AND CONGRESS WILL BE
HERE ATTENDING.
PRESIDENT TRUMP TWEETED
YESTERDAY SAYING, BIG WEEK NEXT
WEEK WHEN THE AMERICAN EMBASSY
IN ISRAEL WILL BE MOVED TO
CONGRATULATIONS TO ALL.
PRESIDENT TRUMP WILL GIVE A
SPEECH BY VIDEO LINK.
THE WEEK IS POLITICALLY
SIGNIFICANT.
THE U.S. MOVING THE EMBASSY BIT
THEY'RE CELEBRATING 50 YEARS
SINCE IT ISRAEL'S UNIFICATION.
ALL THIS IN THE FRAMEWORK OF A
CLEAR POLICY OF GREATER SUPPORT
FOR ISRAEL.
THE OPENING OF THE EMBASSY
COINCIDES WITH MORE THAN SIX
WEEKS OF PROTESTS ALONG THE GAZA
BORDER.
TUESDAY, PALESTINIANS MOURNED
WHAT THEY CALLED A CATASTROPHE
OR OF THE CREATION OF THE JEWISH
STATE.
RECOGNIZING JERUSALEM AS THE
CAPITAL, ONLY PRESIDENT TRUMP
HAS FOLLOWED THROUGH ON THIS.
IT'S CONTROVERSIAL, THE
PALESTINIANS HAVE WALKED AWAY
FROM THE NEGOTIATION TABLE
SAYING THEY HAVE A RIGHT TO
JERUSALEM.
>> ARTHEL: THANK YOU.
>> ERIC: THE SPRING BACK THE
ISRAELI AMBASSADOR TO THE UNITED
NATIONS.
DID YOU EVER THINK YOU COULD SEE
THE DAY WHEN THE U.S. EMBASSY
WOULD BE MOST TO JERUSALEM, IT'S
BEEN PROMISED BEFORE.
>> IT'S AMAZING.
PRESIDENT TRUMP PROMISED IT
DURING THE CAMPAIGN AND HE'S
DOING IT.
IT'S A GREAT DAY FOR US IN
ISRAEL.
MORE COUNTRIES WILL FOLLOW THE
U.S. AND MOVE THERE AT TO SEE TO
JERUSALEM.
IT'S BEEN THE CAPITAL SINCE KING
DAVID.
BUT NOW THE UNITED STATES IS
RECOGNIZING JERUSALEM IS THE
CAPITAL IT WILL BE A BIG
CELEBRATION.
WE WILL ENJOY THE EVENTS WITH
DIGNITARIES.
IT'S VERY SYMBOLIC, A NEW
EMBASSY COMING.
>> TALK ABOUT THE SYMBOLISM IN
THE MESSAGE TO THE MIDDLE EAST.
>> IF YOU WANT TO ACHIEVE PEACE,
YOU HAVE TO BE REALISTIC.
FOR DECADES WE HAVE SEEN MANY
COMING TO THE MIDDLE EAST AND
TRYING TO ACHIEVE WISHFUL
THINKING.
PRESIDENT TRUMP IS COMING,
EVERYBODY KNOWS -- SO HE SAYS
LET'S MOVE ON AND PUT IT ON THE
TABLE.
I THINK IT'S THE RIGHT APPROACH
TO MOVE FORWARD.
HE'S GETTING MORE RESPECT IN THE
MIDDLE EAST.
>> ERIC: WHAT ABOUT CRITICS WHO
SAY IT IS PROVOCATIVE, THAT IT
WILL INCITE VIOLENCE AND ANGER
THE PALESTINIANS?
>> WE HAVE SEEN VIOLENCE,
INCITEMENT ALL OVER, WITH ALL
THOSE INITIATIVES.
WE HAVE SEEN IT WITH OTHER
COUNTRIES.
WE BRING THEM CLOSER TO ISRAEL
AND HOPEFULLY BRING THEM BACK TO
THE TABLE.
>> TO THINK THIS COALITION OF
ALLIES IN ISRAEL HAVE BEEN
HOW DO YOU THINK THIS WILL
AFFECT THE PEACE PROCESS, I DO
YOU SEE A SOLUTION?
>> WE CAN ACHIEVE PEACE.
WE SIGNED AGREEMENTS WITH EGYPT
AND JORDAN.
WE DON'T SEE IT TODAY BUT WE DO
SEE -- WE WANT THEM TO COME HELP
US AND MAYBE WITH THEIR SUPPORT
WE CAN MOVE FORWARD.
>> ERIC: IN YOUR MESSAGE TO THE
PALESTINIAN AUTHORITY?
>> STOP THE VIOLENCE.
DON'T SAID THE KIDS TO BE HUMAN
SHIELDS, COME BACK TO NEGOTIATE.
>> ERIC: THANK YOU FOR COMING
TONIGHT.
