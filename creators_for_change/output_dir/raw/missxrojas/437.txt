00:00:01,650 --> 00:00:03,240
I'm a<font color="#E5E5E5"> video blogger here on youtube</font>

00:00:03,240 --> 00:00:05,009
using the username is sex oral house

4
00:00:05,009 --> 00:00:06,529
I've<font color="#E5E5E5"> been making videos on youtube since</font>

5
00:00:06,529 --> 00:00:09,120
2006 could ease about bonfires and see

6
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:11,340
sides and world events and books

7
00:00:11,340 --> 00:00:12,719
whatever weird thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> they thought up</font>

8
00:00:12,719 --> 00:00:14,639
that day bubble really about growing up

9
00:00:14,639 --> 00:00:15,900
because I've been<font color="#E5E5E5"> making them on here</font>

10
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:17,670
for<font color="#E5E5E5"> such a long time that somehow these</font>

11
00:00:17,670 --> 00:00:19,050
videos film this weird little narrative

12
00:00:19,050 --> 00:00:21,060
I call my youtube channel my scrapbook

13
00:00:21,060 --> 00:00:23,820
because it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not a boxed in thing I</font>

14
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:25,769
don't just<font color="#E5E5E5"> do one thing I try and try</font>

15
00:00:25,769 --> 00:00:27,119
and try<font color="#CCCCCC"> all sorts of different</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> things</font>

16
00:00:27,119 --> 00:00:28,199
and that's kind of how the whole

17
00:00:28,199 --> 00:00:29,730
experience<font color="#CCCCCC"> has been to me</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I've learnt</font>

18
00:00:29,730 --> 00:00:31,679
how to edit<font color="#CCCCCC"> videos I've learned what</font>

19
00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:33,300
works and what doesn't work what I like

20
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:35,880
and what<font color="#CCCCCC"> you guys like and I really</font>

21
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:37,770
appreciate that communication side of

22
00:00:37,770 --> 00:00:39,570
YouTube YouTube is bringing the next up

23
00:00:39,570 --> 00:00:41,430
competition to Europe and I'm in with a

24
00:00:41,430 --> 00:00:44,550
chance to win<font color="#E5E5E5"> 20,000 euros which is it</font>

25
00:00:44,550 --> 00:00:46,950
Nick crazy amount of money I would treat

26
00:00:46,950 --> 00:00:48,930
it as a huge responsibility<font color="#CCCCCC"> a kind of</font>

27
00:00:48,930 --> 00:00:50,640
treats<font color="#E5E5E5"> as an arts grant or creative</font>

28
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:52,800
grant an education grant in a way the

29
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:54,750
prize includes does create account which

30
00:00:54,750 --> 00:00:55,800
I'd be<font color="#E5E5E5"> really interested in attending</font>

31
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:57,420
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> the money itself i would use for</font>

32
00:00:57,420 --> 00:00:59,550
getting a proper video camera because<font color="#E5E5E5"> i</font>

33
00:00:59,550 --> 00:01:00,840
don't actually own one<font color="#E5E5E5"> i have a digital</font>

34
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:02,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">camera that stops recording and a</font>

35
00:01:02,370 --> 00:01:03,930
million<font color="#CCCCCC"> and a half and i have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the webcam</font>

36
00:01:03,930 --> 00:01:05,700
built into my laptop that i use but<font color="#E5E5E5"> i</font>

37
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:07,409
don't have a digital camera<font color="#E5E5E5"> i would use</font>

38
00:01:07,409 --> 00:01:08,970
it have more space on my computer so

39
00:01:08,970 --> 00:01:10,350
that I didn't have to delete half the

40
00:01:10,350 --> 00:01:11,880
footage<font color="#CCCCCC"> that I do end up managing to</font>

41
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:13,470
record because there's not<font color="#CCCCCC"> enough space</font>

42
00:01:13,470 --> 00:01:15,630
to edit it things like microphones say

43
00:01:15,630 --> 00:01:18,299
that when it's windy outside or even

44
00:01:18,299 --> 00:01:20,159
just when I'm filming using my webcam I

45
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:22,500
can<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually have a decent quality of</font>

46
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:24,540
sound without an amazing amount of

47
00:01:24,540 --> 00:01:26,400
portability to my videos for lighting so

48
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:28,110
when I come home late from work or in

49
00:01:28,110 --> 00:01:29,790
the British<font color="#CCCCCC"> winter time I can make</font>

50
00:01:29,790 --> 00:01:31,950
videos a<font color="#CCCCCC"> well-lit a lot of time it does</font>

51
00:01:31,950 --> 00:01:33,540
restrict me sometimes you do see my

52
00:01:33,540 --> 00:01:35,340
videos kind of darkly lit but they

53
00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:37,049
that's just when I managed to<font color="#CCCCCC"> do it a</font>

54
00:01:37,049 --> 00:01:38,460
lot the<font color="#E5E5E5"> time I have to give up because</font>

55
00:01:38,460 --> 00:01:40,110
it's too late at night to film it would

56
00:01:40,110 --> 00:01:42,090
be extremely helpful considering I'm one

57
00:01:42,090 --> 00:01:44,579
year<font color="#CCCCCC"> away from graduating University I</font>

58
00:01:44,579 --> 00:01:46,259
would love to continue to be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to put</font>

59
00:01:46,259 --> 00:01:47,880
<font color="#CCCCCC">aside the time for making these videos</font>

60
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:49,920
without having to panic about making<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

61
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:51,780
between a late shift and early morning

62
00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:53,850
shift this<font color="#E5E5E5"> grant would just open up so</font>

63
00:01:53,850 --> 00:01:56,070
many doors possibility creative

64
00:01:56,070 --> 00:01:57,329
possibility<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> would be absolutely</font>

65
00:01:57,329 --> 00:01:59,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">honored if you voted me that would be so</font>

66
00:01:59,310 --> 00:02:01,320
wonderful just<font color="#CCCCCC"> as a kind of closing</font>

67
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:04,469
parenthesis I think that<font color="#E5E5E5"> the real strong</font>

68
00:02:04,469 --> 00:02:06,509
and probably only thread between the

69
00:02:06,509 --> 00:02:08,610
videos I made when I was younger and<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

70
00:02:08,610 --> 00:02:11,430
videos I make now is me in them although

71
00:02:11,430 --> 00:02:13,230
many of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the things I love are the same I</font>

72
00:02:13,230 --> 00:02:13,590
<font color="#CCCCCC">think</font>

73
00:02:13,590 --> 00:02:15,330
being a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> more daring trying out</font>

74
00:02:15,330 --> 00:02:16,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">different types of videos and putting</font>

75
00:02:16,980 --> 00:02:19,110
footage together in different ways and

76
00:02:19,110 --> 00:02:20,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">performing different stories with it</font>

77
00:02:20,610 --> 00:02:22,379
shall see where that leads but I<font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font>

78
00:02:22,379 --> 00:02:23,730
feel like<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm full of this weird</font>

79
00:02:23,730 --> 00:02:25,680
potential energy I feel like<font color="#E5E5E5"> it can do</font>

80
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:28,920
even more and I would be so so excited

81
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:30,810
did I mention how excited I would be to

82
00:02:30,810 --> 00:02:33,269
win this I would be so excited the end

83
00:02:33,269 --> 00:02:36,180
