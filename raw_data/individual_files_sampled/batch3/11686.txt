and an effort to avoid discrimination police in the Swiss city of Zurich have decided not to release the nationalities of crime suspects to the media regular mention of nationality in police reports is discriminatory because it suggests that the offence can be explained by a perpetrators nationality okay well let's bring in Neal's feature from the Swiss People's Party and also Salman Burt he's Muslim Rights Campaign and also chief editor of Islam 21st century good evening to you both needles let's start with you first do you think this is a good idea good evening no I don't think that is a good idea that's not because one of the biggest problems our country has is being politically correct because we have got massive problems with criminal foreign people and it's not a solution to church don't talk about it when you look for example at the canton of Zurich there are 26.5% foreign people that are doing 54% of all criminal activities these are problems that need to be discussed and Salman I mean you've heard that there what are your views well as far as the action of the police and Jericho I think it makes sense it's quite logical it's not about little correctness it's not about hiding statistics in fact it's about making sure people have more informed statistics in particular statistical significance I'm glad the the other guest he mentioned that statistics in terms of a percentage and that is what you can do more adequately and more properly if you don't focus on individual instances of you know the nationality of a particular you know perpetrator or suspect Neels the police have come out and said when they proposed this they believed that often giving the identity the nationality of a suspect often obscures the root causes of the crime such as poverty or low education or stigmatization don't they have a point no I think when you not when you don't tell the nationality then that will lead to more racism I think all those powers all those politics on the extreme right side they will win when the police and the government won't tell the nationality so I think that's dangerous it will lead to more racism when you don't tell the nationalities another example Switzerland has got one quarter foreign people and in our prisons prisons they are 71 percent of those a criminal activities done by foreign people so we have got a problem and it really isn't a solution to choose don't talk about it and don't mention it Salman people have said that look if if you don't name or if you don't give the nationalities police are open to being accused of covering up I mean that's also a factor here isn't it it's a difficult one for police to balance because they're going to get accused of things on both sides Salman well it's not really logical to mention just these incidental factors of somebody's nationality or other you know descriptions about them if it's not actually relevant to the crime now as for Statistics I'm a big believer of statistical I love statistics you need to you need to know the statistical significance of a particular person's you know a race or ethnicity X committing crime ABC and you don't that's exactly what you get distracted from and you don't get there if you focus on you know mentioning individual perpetrators and nationalities for example in particular press releases which is what this is about the police are not saying that we're not going to release this information the police are saying in initial press releases they're not going to mention it and they shouldn't because it makes no sense but if people want to know statistic yeah for example how many put what percentage of you know this nationality might be doing this crime then that's a logical request to ask and that something people can and should ask in order to get an understanding of you know the statistical significance of certain crimes because what happens is when people read a headline with you know and that says you know F can man does X crime we all know study after study after study perfect no the average the average people okay the average European he or she thinks that oh grossly exaggerated over indicates the amount the number of neutrons they think based on your logic yeah okay based on your logic it should be also for Peyton to tell the gender or he eight so it should be also be a discrimination when the police says that a woman has murdered her husband so then it's coop Kupiec discrimination to all women or it could be a discrimination when an old man makes a car accident that's not logical nationality a chander these are all relevant things to understand for the public what is going on in the in their cities we have got a right to know what's going on and which groups of person are doing crime it's just a normal police are not taking away that right the police are not taking away that right what the police are doing if you press release they're saying they're not going to mention it in the initial press releases but if somebody wants to know is somebody looking at you know a particular problem with any with the particular logical outcome in mind then they will more than happily disclose that information the point is I suppose what Neil is saying is where do you draw the line I mean if you're going to sort of not languish and somebody's nationality where do you draw the line that's a good question and you know you just get it with trial and error and every country every people every force should you should be you know have the it's that prerogative to to decide that for themselves and the United Kingdom for example we have you know laws and or regulation that the press for example abide by in that they shouldn't mention a person's certain protected qualities under you know in qualities acts or act or discriminatory laws unless they actually you know a core to the actual crime or the actual story so mentioning you know it's a particular man of a particular age you know if it's to describe a person fair enough for sure it's to situation to our country in our country the state has is the official task of informing people transparently it's a task from the government from the state from the police that the people know what is going on it's an official task to inform them to inform them transparently and it cannot be that you just be quiet about the nationality it is very important that talking about know quiet what is going on it's a security problem I suppose the other thing about being quiet here we're talking about police ensuring proper transparency not pseudo transparency as they as they described it because a mentioning of as you see mentioning a particular person's nationality for example in a case where it's not actually integral or not was not positive to the actual crime will skew people's perception of the reality and in order to give them an accurate representation of reality they need statistics with statistical significance so for example they will need to be told you know X number of Africans as a percentage of the whole for example in Sweden it was I think in 2016 the official reports are one and a half million crimes right so they need to know okay maybe a few X percent of crimes are committed by this demographic with that demographic not known to whip up racism or whatever irrational fears but to actually address it and causes to have problems like you know maybe that particular group is suffering a particular mental illness or a particular you know needs let me just address this to you I think in summary what Salman is also saying is that look there are many groups in society that are stigmatized and they will make the headlines whereas if it's a white male committing a crime he will not make the headlines because he's a white male but the scenes you put the word Muslim in the headline you know it's gonna grab attention much more it becomes news yeah that causes a lot of crimes by Muslim are terrorist attacks so I think that's more interesting for the media than just a car accident that's a terrorist attack he's talking about talk about all crime yeah even if we do talk about your statistics for about seven eight I'm sure sorry go ahead salmon that's a really rooms with Purim people it was just let someone finish and I'll come back to you Salman go ahead okay yeah so you mentioned terrorism for example this is a good example to highlight the issue of cherry-picking statistics as opposed to looking at statistical significance if you run had new newspaper headlines with Muslim terrorists Muslim terrorist Muslim terrorists you get people like my interlocutor here who is under the impression that Muslims are way over representative when it comes to terror so-called terrorism in Europe but if you look at statistics ie how many Muslims are they who are so-called terrorists compared to the rest of the so-called terrorists and in the population you see like in 2014 0.7% of terrorist attacks from I think 2006 to 2014 in Europe are committed by perpetrated by Muslims I'm not saying ignore it I'm saying given its actual statistical significance then you can actually look at the scale of the problem Neos respond yeah yeah I think you know you have to look at all that bureaucracy for example when there is crime in the city of Zurich when someone murders his husband a women murders his husband then police makes official announcement that that had happened in the city of Zurich and then you should imagine all those media M all those TV shows a newspaper they are gonna call the police and ask who has done it that's the natural thing about that so there will be a much bureaucracy and much of off office work for the police and I think they have got much better things to do yes but he's absolutely right isn't he that people will call because it's you know free information the police and say okay well you know can you tell you and then it will become a bigger story it could actually be counterproductive Salman mmm-hmm it could be that's a good argue that's that's that's a good argument good question to pose to the police but the initial reasoning their logic is that it's discriminatory and it is you can you can tell it's not really a rational you know thing to include in someone's and reporting someone's crime if their nationality had nothing to do with their crime knee was what's been the public position all right the gender doesn't also have nothing to do husbands because it's option women but maybe because she's driving or high or something like that so you should argue that it's always a discrimination by the age or made a gender where is the line you can draw it was just tell me what's the sort of public perception in Switzerland at the moment with regard to this because some police forces are for it some are against it there's obviously a division in opinion here yeah me personally I think that the police men are fully against that new bill in the City of Surrey but I can't they say that for sure but we had some initiative so some referendums in the Canton's of Sala turn and also some Colin there it was a parliament who has discussed that and it was absolutely clear that we want to prevent the actual situation to name the nationality because that's a safety strategies which I learned has and it's absolutely ridiculous to just be quiet about it so I think the people stand behind the position that it's important to name the nationality salmon do you have that sense but I mean you're from the UK I believe do you sense that that's the case there again it's they're not even being quite about it they're choosing to not omit something that does from it because you include so it doesn't make sense to include it in the beginning so they're not being quiet about this they're just not mentioning you know certain incidental characteristics or the perpetrator or the suspect so just as you can take it one extreme and say no not mention nothing don't mention the gender don't mention anything about them likewise you can take it to another extreme you could would you mention that the ginger they weigh this much that they you know they they're from this particular village or they support this particular local football team certain things are in a dental to the actual crime with a suspect I can someone we're running out of time here positive we have two we just got one minute left just give me what answer Salman do you think that other police forces will follow suit what's your opinion on that Salman well I don't know about the situation in Sweden but I know for example in in the UK this isn't a practice that they normally do thank God and I think other police court forces should should you know take take heed to that and not pander to this this projection of anxieties onto certain nationalities or certain minorities okay Neil was last 15 seconds yeah I hope not I hope that the city of Zurich is the only city in whole Switzerland that does it like that because that's absolutely ridiculous we have to stop being politically correct we have to focus on our real problems and our problems is that foreign people in Switzerland are more criminal than Swiss ones that's a fact okay look thanks gents we're gonna have to wrap it up there sorry Sam I'm gonna have to cut you off there too thank you gentlemen that reserved news feature from the Swiss People's Party and also Salman Black Muslim rights campaigner and chief editor to at Islam 21st century thanks guys
