1
00:00:01,887 --> 00:00:03,889
TO THAT CLEAR CONTRADICTION IN

2
00:00:03,889 --> 00:00:04,423
TESTIMONY.

3
00:00:04,423 --> 00:00:06,492
>> Martha: PETER KING,

4
00:00:06,492 --> 00:00:07,159
CONGRESSMAN, THANK YOU VERY

5
00:00:07,159 --> 00:00:07,460
MUCH.

6
00:00:07,460 --> 00:00:08,093
ALWAYS GOOD TO SEE YOU.

7
00:00:08,093 --> 00:00:11,197
JOINING ME NOW IS JUDGE EVENT OF

8
00:00:13,432 --> 00:00:14,834
-- FORMER INDEPENDENT CONSOLE.

9
00:00:14,834 --> 00:00:16,569
AND A FORMER SENIOR ADVISOR TO

10
00:00:16,569 --> 00:00:17,036
HILLARY CLINTON.

11
00:00:17,036 --> 00:00:19,005
WELCOME, GENTLEMEN.

12
00:00:19,005 --> 00:00:20,806
I JUST WANT TO PLAY THE

13
00:00:20,806 --> 00:00:21,841
SOUND BITE FROM PRESIDENT TRUMP

14
00:00:21,841 --> 00:00:24,443
WHEN HE SPOKE TO "FOX & FRIENDS"

15
00:00:24,443 --> 00:00:25,111
LAST WEEK IN REGARDS TO THE

16
00:00:25,111 --> 00:00:28,014
JUSTICE DEPARTMENT.

17
00:00:28,014 --> 00:00:29,415
>> VERY DISAPPOINTED IN MY

18
00:00:29,415 --> 00:00:29,949
JUSTICE DEPARTMENT.

19
00:00:29,949 --> 00:00:30,816
BUT BECAUSE OF THE FACT IT'S

20
00:00:30,816 --> 00:00:32,018
GOING ON AND I THINK YOU'LL

21
00:00:32,018 --> 00:00:34,120
UNDERSTAND THIS, I HAVE DECIDED

22
00:00:34,120 --> 00:00:36,822
THAT I WON'T BE INVOLVED.

23
00:00:36,822 --> 00:00:38,324
I MAY CHANGE MY MIND AT SOME

24
00:00:38,324 --> 00:00:39,091
POINT BECAUSE WHAT'S GOING ON IS

25
00:00:39,091 --> 00:00:40,960
A DISGRACE.

26
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:43,262
IT'S AN ABSOLUTE DISGRACE.

27
00:00:43,262 --> 00:00:45,097
>> Martha: WHAT DID YOU MAKE

28
00:00:45,097 --> 00:00:45,664
OF THAT COMMENT?

29
00:00:45,664 --> 00:00:46,832
>> I THINK THE PRESIDENT IS

30
00:00:46,832 --> 00:00:47,233
FRUSTRATED.

31
00:00:47,233 --> 00:00:48,834
AND HE SHOULD BE.

32
00:00:48,834 --> 00:00:50,236
I THINK WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN,

33
00:00:50,236 --> 00:00:52,738
MARTHA, APROPOS OF COMEY'S

34
00:00:52,738 --> 00:00:55,508
COMMENTS AND CLAPPER IS A PARENT

35
00:00:55,508 --> 00:00:58,811
LYING JOHN HUBER, WHO'S BEEN

36
00:00:58,811 --> 00:01:00,413
SELECTED TO SHOW THE PFIZER

37
00:01:00,413 --> 00:01:01,147
ILLEGALITY WILL BE INVESTIGATING

38
00:01:01,147 --> 00:01:02,782
ALL THE THINGS THAT WE JUST

39
00:01:02,782 --> 00:01:05,618
TALKED ABOUT.

40
00:01:05,618 --> 00:01:07,620
THE GRAND JURY SUBPOENA WILL

41
00:01:07,620 --> 00:01:09,422
ISSUE FROM MR. COMEY,

42
00:01:09,422 --> 00:01:12,425
MR. CLAPPER, AND MR. BRENNAN.

43
00:01:12,425 --> 00:01:13,826
PENDING THE GRAND JURY'S

44
00:01:13,826 --> 00:01:16,028
APPEASER, I THINK MR. KLAPPER

45
00:01:16,028 --> 00:01:16,729
AND MR. COMEY AND MR. BRENNAN

46
00:01:16,729 --> 00:01:21,834
SHOULD HAVE THE ROOT SECURITY CE

47
00:01:21,834 --> 00:01:21,867
SHOULD HAVE THE ROOT SECURITY CR

48
00:01:21,867 --> 00:01:21,901
SHOULD HAVE THE ROOT SECURITY CN

49
00:01:21,901 --> 00:01:21,934
SHOULD HAVE THE ROOT SECURITY CE

50
00:01:21,934 --> 00:01:21,967
SHOULD HAVE THE ROOT SECURITY CS

51
00:01:21,967 --> 00:01:22,001
SHOULD HAVE THE ROOT SECURITY CR

52
00:01:22,034 --> 00:01:22,068
SHOULD HAVE THE ROOT SECURITY CK

53
00:01:22,068 --> 00:01:22,301
SHOULD HAVE THE ROOT SECURITY CD

54
00:01:22,301 --> 00:01:25,504
UNTIL THE GRAND JURY AND JUSTICE

55
00:01:25,504 --> 00:01:26,205
DEPARTMENT MAKE DETERMINATIONS

56
00:01:26,205 --> 00:01:27,973
ABOUT THEIR RESPONSIBILITY.

57
00:01:27,973 --> 00:01:31,510
THEIR CONDUCT FROM DISCLOSED

58
00:01:31,510 --> 00:01:33,579
INVITATIONS

59
00:01:33,579 --> 00:01:34,246
CONVERSATIONS VIOLATED THE

60
00:01:34,246 --> 00:01:35,714
STANDARDS FOR MAINTAINING

61
00:01:35,714 --> 00:01:37,216
SECURITY CLEARANCE AND THE

62
00:01:37,216 --> 00:01:38,651
CURRENT DIRECTOR OF NATIONAL

63
00:01:38,651 --> 00:01:39,718
INTELLIGENCE, DAN COATS, SHOULD

64
00:01:39,718 --> 00:01:41,754
REVOKE ALL OF THEIR SECURITY

65
00:01:41,754 --> 00:01:42,755
CLEARANCES PENDING THE GRAND

66
00:01:42,755 --> 00:01:45,424
JURY OUTCOME.

67
00:01:45,424 --> 00:01:47,426
>> Martha: WHAT DO YOU THINK

68
00:01:47,426 --> 00:01:47,860
ABOUT THAT?

69
00:01:47,860 --> 00:01:50,029
>> A COUPLE OF THINGS.

70
00:01:50,029 --> 00:01:50,963
FIRST, I AGREE WITH CONGRESSMAN

71
00:01:50,963 --> 00:01:51,997
KING WHEN HE SAYS THIS IS A VERY

72
00:01:51,997 --> 00:01:54,967
DARK PERIOD OF AMERICAN

73
00:01:54,967 --> 00:01:56,802
INTELLIGENCE IN THE SENSE OF THE

74
00:01:56,802 --> 00:01:58,170
LAST 15 MONTHS IT'S BEEN VERY

75
00:01:58,170 --> 00:01:58,571
POLITICIZED.

76
00:01:58,571 --> 00:02:00,406
I DON'T THINK THAT'S GOOD FOR

77
00:02:00,406 --> 00:02:00,806
AMERICA.

78
00:02:00,806 --> 00:02:02,208
I WANT TO LOOK AT WHAT

79
00:02:02,208 --> 00:02:04,210
PRESIDENT TRUMP JUST SAID.

80
00:02:04,210 --> 00:02:05,611
HE SAID "MY JUSTICE DEPARTMENT."

81
00:02:05,611 --> 00:02:07,613
DO YOU KNOW WHAT?

82
00:02:07,613 --> 00:02:08,614
THAT'S KEY.

83
00:02:08,614 --> 00:02:10,883
FOR 15 MONTHS NOW, HE HAS BEEN

84
00:02:10,883 --> 00:02:11,250
PRESIDENT.

85
00:02:11,250 --> 00:02:12,318
ATTORNEY GENERAL SESSIONS IS AS

86
00:02:12,318 --> 00:02:14,453
AN APPOINTEE THE DEPUTY GENERATE

87
00:02:16,021 --> 00:02:17,623
-- THEY ARE ALL HIS APPOINTEES.

88
00:02:17,623 --> 00:02:19,058
THE NOTION ON THE ONE HAND THAT

89
00:02:19,058 --> 00:02:20,059
HE IS BEING PERSECUTED BY THEM,

90
00:02:20,059 --> 00:02:24,196
WHICH IS SOMETHING THAT MR.

91
00:02:24,196 --> 00:02:25,231
MR. GENOVA BELIEVES AND BELIEVES

92
00:02:25,231 --> 00:02:26,465
IS BEING FRAMED, AND IN OTHER

93
00:02:26,465 --> 00:02:27,566
HAND HE'S IN CHARGE OF THE

94
00:02:27,566 --> 00:02:29,802
PLACE, DOESN'T MAKE SENSE.

95
00:02:29,802 --> 00:02:31,604
IF IT WAS HILLARY CLINTON AS

96
00:02:31,604 --> 00:02:33,539
PRESIDENT AND ME AS A

97
00:02:33,539 --> 00:02:35,307
WHITE HOUSE ADVISOR AND CHELSEA

98
00:02:35,307 --> 00:02:36,408
CLINTON AS ATTORNEY GENERAL, I'D

99
00:02:36,408 --> 00:02:37,977
UNDERSTAND THE NOTION OF, LIKE,

100
00:02:37,977 --> 00:02:38,811
THEY CAN'T BE FAIR, THEY ARE

101
00:02:38,811 --> 00:02:40,779
PICKING ON ME.

102
00:02:40,779 --> 00:02:42,915
I DON'T UNDERSTAND IT NOW.

103
00:02:42,915 --> 00:02:43,682
>> Martha: JOE, WHAT DO YOU

104
00:02:43,682 --> 00:02:45,885
SAY TO THAT?

105
00:02:45,885 --> 00:02:47,586
>> I THINK THE PRESIDENT'S

106
00:02:47,586 --> 00:02:48,721
FRUSTRATION STEMS FROM THE FACT

107
00:02:48,721 --> 00:02:51,824
THAT THE APPOINTMENT OF

108
00:02:51,824 --> 00:02:53,225
MR. MUELLER IN MY OPINION SHOULD

109
00:02:53,225 --> 00:02:55,027
HAVE NEVER OCCURRED BECAUSE WHEN

110
00:02:55,027 --> 00:02:56,295
MR. ROSENSTEIN APPOINTED HIM,

111
00:02:56,295 --> 00:02:58,464
THERE IS NO EVIDENCE OF A CRIME.

112
00:02:58,464 --> 00:02:59,265
INDEED, HE MENTIONED NO CRIME IN

113
00:02:59,265 --> 00:03:02,201
THE APPOINTMENT PAPERS.

114
00:03:02,201 --> 00:03:03,068
I DO THINK WHAT'S GOING TO

115
00:03:03,068 --> 00:03:05,905
HAPPEN NOW IS THE PEOPLE AT THE

116
00:03:05,905 --> 00:03:06,572
JUSTICE DEPARTMENT IS DOING

117
00:03:06,572 --> 00:03:08,207
THEIR JOBS.

118
00:03:08,207 --> 00:03:09,742
THEY SENT IT OUT TO MR. HUBER

119
00:03:09,742 --> 00:03:11,744
WHO HAS WHAT THAT WILL BE THE

120
00:03:11,744 --> 00:03:13,412
SINGLE MOST SINGLE INVESTIGATION

121
00:03:13,412 --> 00:03:13,746
AT ALL.

122
00:03:13,746 --> 00:03:17,183
I AGREE WITH PHILIPPE.

123
00:03:17,183 --> 00:03:18,717
THOSE 15 MONTHS HAVE BEEN JUST

124
00:03:18,717 --> 00:03:19,018
AWFUL.

125
00:03:19,018 --> 00:03:20,386
I WILL TELL YOU THIS.

126
00:03:20,386 --> 00:03:23,189
I THINK THE WORST PART OF AND

127
00:03:23,189 --> 00:03:24,657
AMERICAN INTELLIGENCE AND

128
00:03:24,657 --> 00:03:25,457
LAW ENFORCEMENT CAME JULY 5TH

129
00:03:25,457 --> 00:03:28,093
2016 WHEN JAMES COMEY USURPED

130
00:03:28,093 --> 00:03:29,995
THE FUNCTIONS OF THE ATTORNEY

131
00:03:29,995 --> 00:03:30,996
GENERAL.

132
00:03:30,996 --> 00:03:32,164
THAT WAS THE DARKEST DAY IN

133
00:03:32,164 --> 00:03:34,200
AMERICAN LAW ENFORCEMENT IN 100

134
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:34,800
YEARS.

135
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:36,402
>> Martha: THAT IS WHAT THE

136
00:03:36,402 --> 00:03:37,069
INSPECTOR GENERAL IS LOOKING

137
00:03:37,069 --> 00:03:38,337
INTO IN TERMS OF THAT PART OF

138
00:03:38,337 --> 00:03:38,971
THE INVESTIGATION.

139
00:03:38,971 --> 00:03:41,006
I WANT TO ASK YOU BOTH A

140
00:03:41,006 --> 00:03:42,708
QUESTION ABOUT THIS NOBEL PRIZE,

141
00:03:42,708 --> 00:03:43,943
BECAUSE WE TALKED ABOUT THE

142
00:03:43,943 --> 00:03:47,079
AWARD THAT CNN WAS GIVEN FOR

143
00:03:47,079 --> 00:03:49,048
PUTTING THE STEELE DOSSIER INTO

144
00:03:49,048 --> 00:03:51,016
THE LEXICON THE OTHER NIGHT.

145
00:03:51,016 --> 00:03:52,484
THERE IS A SUGGESTION BY THE

146
00:03:52,484 --> 00:03:55,354
PRESIDENT OF SOUTH KOREA THAT

147
00:03:55,354 --> 00:03:56,288
PRESIDENT TRUMP SHOULD WIN THE

148
00:03:56,288 --> 00:03:56,822
NOBEL PEACE PRIZE.

149
00:03:56,822 --> 00:03:59,425
THE ONLY THING WE NEED IS PEACE.

150
00:03:59,425 --> 00:04:00,426
PHILIPPE, WHAT DO YOU THINK

151
00:04:00,426 --> 00:04:00,826
ABOUT THAT?

152
00:04:00,826 --> 00:04:02,795
HE SHOULD BE CONSIDERED FOR

153
00:04:02,795 --> 00:04:03,095
THAT.

154
00:04:03,095 --> 00:04:05,464
>> HE COULD BE CONSIDERED.

155
00:04:05,464 --> 00:04:05,798
[LAUGHS]

156
00:04:05,798 --> 00:04:09,768
I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO SAY -- I DO

157
00:04:09,902 --> 00:04:11,103
GET A CHANCE TO SAY IT AGAIN

158
00:04:11,103 --> 00:04:13,038
THAT I WHOLEHEARTEDLY AGREE WITH

159
00:04:13,038 --> 00:04:16,475
JOE AND EVOLVE WHAT HE SAID

160
00:04:16,475 --> 00:04:19,511
ABOUT JIM COMEY'S BEHAVIOR ON

161
00:04:19,511 --> 00:04:19,978
JULY 6, 2016.

162
00:04:19,978 --> 00:04:21,247
ON THE NOBEL, LOOK AT WHAT'S

163
00:04:21,247 --> 00:04:23,682
HAPPENING WITH NORTH KOREA IS

164
00:04:23,682 --> 00:04:24,049
IMPORTANT.

165
00:04:24,049 --> 00:04:25,017
LET'S LET IT PLAY OUT.

166
00:04:25,017 --> 00:04:25,985
I DON'T THINK ANYBODY IS DOING

167
00:04:25,985 --> 00:04:28,821
THIS FOR THE PRIZE.

168
00:04:28,821 --> 00:04:29,822
>> Martha: IT'S CERTAINLY

169
00:04:29,822 --> 00:04:30,990
JUMPING THE GUN, ANYBODY WOULD

170
00:04:30,990 --> 00:04:31,790
SAY THAT.

171
00:04:31,790 --> 00:04:33,392
IT CERTAINLY REMINDS PEOPLE OF

172
00:04:33,392 --> 00:04:34,360
PERHAPS WHEN THE NOBEL COMMITTEE

173
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:36,695
JUMPED THE GUN AND GIVING ONE TO

174
00:04:36,695 --> 00:04:37,997
PRESIDENT OBAMA.

175
00:04:37,997 --> 00:04:38,864
HE THOUGHT IT WAS TOO SOON, BUT

176
00:04:38,864 --> 00:04:40,499
HE SAID THEY GAVE IT TO HIM

177
00:04:40,499 --> 00:04:41,500
BECAUSE HE WAS TRYING TO LOWER

178
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:42,501
THE TEMPERATURE IN TERMS OF

179
00:04:42,501 --> 00:04:45,804
NUCLEAR WAR IN THE WORLD AND

180
00:04:45,804 --> 00:04:46,572
JOE, IT LOOKS LIKE THE PRESIDENT

181
00:04:46,572 --> 00:04:49,241
IS MAKING SOME AT LEAST SOME

182
00:04:49,241 --> 00:04:49,608
PROGRESS.

183
00:04:49,608 --> 00:04:52,711
>> THE PRESIDENT HAS CHANGED THE

184
00:04:52,711 --> 00:04:55,014
PARADIGM AND HAS MADE GREAT

185
00:04:55,014 --> 00:04:56,582
SUCCESS AND MOMENTUM RIGHT NOW

186
00:04:56,582 --> 00:04:57,383
IN NORTH KOREA.

187
00:04:57,383 --> 00:04:59,184
LET'S ALL KEEP OUR FINGERS

188
00:04:59,184 --> 00:05:00,419
CROSSED.

189
00:05:00,419 --> 00:05:01,053
NOTHING HAS BEEN FINALLY

190
00:05:01,053 --> 00:05:03,389
ACCOMPLISHED, BUT I MUST SAY.

191
00:05:03,389 --> 00:05:04,156
LOOKING AT IT RIGHT NOW, WE ARE

192
00:05:04,156 --> 00:05:06,759
AT AN AMAZING SPOT IN THE

193
00:05:06,759 --> 00:05:08,360

00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:10,796
BETWEEN NORTH AND SOUTH KOREA.

195
00:05:10,796 --> 00:05:11,797
