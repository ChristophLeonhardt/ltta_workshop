THE MID-TERM ELECTION. HERE WITH REACTION, FORMER TRUMP CAMPAIGN MANAGER COREY LEWANDOWSKI AND CONSERVATIVE COLUMNIST, ANN COULTER AUTHOR OF "RESISTANCE IS FUTILE." THIS IS PROBABLY THE MOST OF FAIR AND BALANCED PANEL I HAVE EVER HAD. BECAUSE OF THAT, I'M GOING TO PLAY A DEMOCRAT. I AM JUST KIDDING. I WANT TO PLAY SOME SOUND OF THE PRESIDENT PRAISING MITCH MCCONNELL. PRESIDENT TRUMP: HE'LL GO DOWN AS THE GREATEST LEADER IN MY OPINION IN HISTORY. WHAT WE HAVE DONE IS INCREDIBLE TOGETHER. BUT HE'S BETTER WHEN I'M PRESIDENT THAN HE EVER WAS WHEN ANYBODY ELSE WAS PRESIDENT. JESSE: MAKE MITCH GREAT AGAIN. HOW ARE YOU GOING TO TURN THAT INTO IMMIGRATION. GIVE ME 30 SECONDS. RIGHT AFTER KAVANAUGH GETS THROUGH YOU HAVE GOT TO PRAISE MITCH MCCONNELL. BUT THE MISTAKE OF THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION SO FAR IS TRUMP GIVING INTO THE MITCH MCCONNELL AGENDA RATHER THAN THE OTHER WAY AROUND. MCCAIN COULDN'T WIN THE WAY THE COUNTRY HAS BEEN CHANGED BY IMMIGRATION. TRUMP WON, SO WHY DON'T REPUBLICANS IN CONGRESS THINK THIS GUY KNOWS HOW TO DO IT. LET'S BE LIKE HIM AND PASS FUNDING FOR THE WALL. NO, THEY GO BACK TO THE OLD REPUBLICAN PLAYBOOK. TAX CUTS. MILITARY SPENDING. CONTINUE THE VARIOUS WARS WE HAVE AROUND THE UNIVERSE. WHO ARE THE BIGGEST STARS RIGHT NOW IN THE REPUBLICAN PARTY? DONALD TRUMP, LINDSEY GRAHAM AND THAT WONDERFUL BILL CASSIDY. WHAT DID THEY DO? THEY STOOD UP FOR LIBERALS. YOU KNOW THE BILL CASSIDY CLIP I'M TALKING ABOUT. JESSE: HE GOES UP TO A WOMAN WHO BROUGHT HER KIDS AND SHE SAID YOU ARE RUINING MY CHILDREN'S FUTURE. AND HE SAID YOUR MOTHER IS TURNING YOU INTO A PAWN. I THINK YOU HAVE TO PRAISE MITCH MCCONNELL FOR GETTING THE FEDERAL JUDGES BEFORE THE SYSTEM. HE PUT 84 JUDGES INTO THE SYSTEM WHICH HAS LONG-TERM EFFECTS. BUT THE PRESIDENT HAS DON'T AGAINST THE WILL OF THE SENATE. HE JUST NOMINATED MORE PEOPLE TO THE 9th CIRCUIT THAT WERE WITHOUT THE ADVICE AND CONSENT OF THE TWO SENATORS FROM CALIFORNIA. THE IMMIGRATION ISSUE HAD TO GO ALL THE WAY TO THE SUPREME COURT FOR A 9-0 DECISION TO SAY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES HAS THE AUTHORITY TO PREVENT PEOPLE FROM COMING INTO THIS COUNTRY HE BELIEVES ARE A DETRIMENT TO OUR COUNTRY. THE SAME POWER EVERY PRESIDENT HAS USED SINCE WORLD WAR II. BUT WE HAVE SEEN JUDGES TOO OFTEN LEGISLATING FROM THE BENCH. THEY HAVE CHANGED THE COURT SYSTEM WHICH WILL HAVE LONG-TERM RAMIFICATION. JESSE: I WANT TO PLAY SOME UPPING SOUND OF THE PRESIDENT TODAY IN THE OVAL OFFICE. HE JUST SECURED THE RELEASE OF A PRISONER ABROAD FROM TURKEY. LET'S WATCH THIS SPECIAL MOMENT. IN THE OVAL OFFICE WHEN HE WAS THERE PRAYING WITH THE PASTOR WHO WAS JUST RELEASED FROM TURKEY, CAN WE PLAY THAT. WE ALL SAW THAT TODAY. I KNOW WE TALK ABOUT IMMIGRATION. BUT IT WAS A VERY SPECIAL MOMENT WHEN HE SECURED THE RELEASE OF THIS PRISONER. THIS PRESIDENT HAS DONE THAT CONSIST TEMPTLY WHETHER IT'S IN NORTH KOREA, WHETHER IT'S AND * OR ALL AROUND THE WORLD. AND THE AMERICAN PEOPLE WHEN THEY SEE THIS, WHEN THEY SEE THIS, IT SHOWS THIS PRESIDENT REALLY CARES ABOUT EACH INDIVIDUAL AMERICAN. THERE IT IS RIGHT THERE. ALL OF THE PASTORS, AND A LOT OF BLACK PASTORS PRAYING WITH TRUMP DURING THE CAMPAIGN. I THOUGHT IT WAS SINCERE AND GIN WIN WHAT HE SAID IN RESPONSE TO THE ACCESS HOLLYWOOD TAPE, THAT RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT HAS CHANGED HIM. JESSE: LOOK AT THE PIOUS, HUMBLE TRUMP WOWING DOWN RIGHT THERE. YOU DON'T HAVE SO MANY CHRISTIANS PRAYING OVER YOU AND BRINGING A YOU WITHOUT IT HAVING AN EFFECT. BRINGING AMERICANS HOME WHO HAVE BEEN CAPTIVE OVERSEAS. NO ONE IS TALKING ABOUT THE WOMAN WHO WAS A CAPTIVE IN EGYPT AND HE BROUGHT HER HOME. HE WENT TO JOINT BASE ANDREWS ONE NIGHT AT MIDNIGHT TO SEE PEOPLE COMING HOME OFF THAT PLANE. WITHOUT BUCKET LOADS OF MONEY AND PELLET LOADS OF CASH. HE'S NOT AL LET HE'S NOT P LET HE'S NOT PALET HE'S NOT PALLET LOADS OF CASH. AND THIS TIME THEY UNDERSTAND IF YOU CROSS THIS PERSON THERE WILL BE A WE SOURCE. CAN I BE THE DEMOCRAT HERE. THOUGH THAT IS TRUE. I'M NOT THAT ENTHUSIASTIC. THAT'S NOT BRINGING PEOPLE OUT TO VOTE. WHAT ARE PEOPLE DOING IN THESE RIDICULOUS COUNTRIES ANYWAY. I FEEL LIKE IT'S SKIERS WHO GO OFF INTO A NO-SKIING AREA, AVALANCHE WARNING DON'T GO, AND WE HAVE TO SPEND ALL THIS MONEY TO GET THEM BACK. JESSE: TURKEY CAN BE A VERY NICE PLACE TO BE. IT'S A MUCH MORE IMPORTANT THING TO PROTECT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. JESSE: THE PRESIDENT DELINEATED THAT. PRESIDENT TRUMP: THE FACT IS DEMOCRATS HAVE BECOME THE PARTY OF CRIME. THEY HAVE. REPUBLICANS ARE THE PARTY OF SAFETY, AND WE ARE THE PARTY OF JOBS, JOBS, JOBS. JESSE: THE PRESIDENT HAS I BELIEVE A GIFT POLITICALLY FOR IN PLAQUE AND WHITE TERMS. THEY ARE SOCIALISTS, WE ARE CAPITALISTS. WE LIKE LAW AND ORDER, THEY LOVE CRIME. NO PRESIDENT HAS EVER PUT ANYTHING THOSE TAX TERMS BEFORE AND THAT'S DRIVING THESE LIBERALS MAD. HE GOES ALONG WITH JARED KUSHNER'S IDEA ON PRISON REFORM. HE'LL BE THE CRIME PRESIDENT. WARNING, MR. PRESIDENT. ONE OTHER THING ABOUT THE IMMIGRATION ISSUE. YOU ARE RIGHT ABOUT THE COURTS. THE COURTS WILL NOT MATTER. THE KAVANAUGH NOMINATION WILL NOT MATTER. IF IMMIGRATION CHANGES THIS COUNTRY ENOUGH THAT WE CAN NEVER GET ANOTHER REPUBLICAN
