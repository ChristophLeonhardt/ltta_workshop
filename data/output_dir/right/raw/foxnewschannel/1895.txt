1
00:00:01,774 --> 00:00:02,742
STORY LIVE IN JERUSALEM TONIGHT.

2
00:00:02,742 --> 00:00:05,111
WHAT IS THE MOOD THERE ON THE

3
00:00:05,111 --> 00:00:08,314
GROUND TONIGHT IN ISRAEL,

4
00:00:08,314 --> 00:00:09,115
BENJAMIN?

5
00:00:09,115 --> 00:00:10,283
>> HI, SHEP.

6
00:00:10,283 --> 00:00:12,251
A CALM HAS FALLEN OVER THIS

7
00:00:12,251 --> 00:00:13,352
COUNTRY AND CHILDREN WERE BACK

8
00:00:13,352 --> 00:00:14,754
AT SCHOOL TODAY BUT WAITING TO

9
00:00:14,754 --> 00:00:15,688
SEE WHAT MIGHT HAPPEN TONIGHT.

10
00:00:15,688 --> 00:00:17,690
MAKE NO MISTAKE, THIS WAS A

11
00:00:17,690 --> 00:00:18,257
MAJOR EVENT.

12
00:00:18,257 --> 00:00:19,926
AS YOU SAY, THIS IS THE FIRST

13
00:00:19,926 --> 00:00:21,928
TIME I RAN HAD DIRECTLY ATTACKED

14
00:00:21,928 --> 00:00:24,931
ISRAEL FROM ACROSS THE BORDER IN

15
00:00:24,931 --> 00:00:25,431
SYRIA.

16
00:00:25,431 --> 00:00:28,534
IT WAS THE LARGEST AIR OPERATION

17
00:00:28,534 --> 00:00:30,636
CARRIED OUT SINK THE 1973 WAR.

18
00:00:30,636 --> 00:00:32,271
THIS IS A CLEAR SIGN TO IRAN

19
00:00:32,271 --> 00:00:34,740
THAT THEY CANNOT ENCROACH ON THE

20
00:00:34,740 --> 00:00:36,142
BORDERS OF ISRAEL ANYMORE.

21
00:00:36,142 --> 00:00:37,476
WE'VE SEEN IT HAPPEN THE LAST

22
00:00:37,476 --> 00:00:38,144
FEW YEARS.

23
00:00:38,144 --> 00:00:39,712
THEY HAVE MOVED SOME TROOPS AND

24
00:00:39,712 --> 00:00:41,747
SET UP SOME SORT OF BASES IN

25
00:00:41,747 --> 00:00:42,048
SYRIA.

26
00:00:42,048 --> 00:00:44,550
LAST NIGHT WE SAW THEM REACT TO

27
00:00:44,550 --> 00:00:44,850
THAT.

28
00:00:44,850 --> 00:00:48,654
WE SAW ISRAEL REACT IN A BIG

29
00:00:48,654 --> 00:00:49,221
WAY.

30
00:00:49,221 --> 00:00:50,456
ISRAEL HAS SAID FOR SOME TIME

31
00:00:50,456 --> 00:00:54,427
THAT THEY EXPECTED AN IRANIAN

32
00:00:54,427 --> 00:00:54,760
ATTACK.

33
00:00:54,760 --> 00:00:55,828
WE'VE SEEN ISRAEL MOVE PEOPLE UP

34
00:00:55,828 --> 00:00:57,163
TO THE HEIGHTS.

35
00:00:57,163 --> 00:00:58,531
THAT'S BECAUSE THESE

36
00:00:58,531 --> 00:00:59,632
CROSS-BORDER RAIDS BY ISRAEL

37
00:00:59,632 --> 00:01:01,233
HAVE SUPPOSEDLY BEEN GOING ON

38
00:01:01,233 --> 00:01:03,436
FOR SOME TIME, TAKING OUT,

39
00:01:03,436 --> 00:01:05,605
PICKING OUT IRANIAN TARGETS

40
00:01:05,605 --> 00:01:05,905
THERE.

41
00:01:05,905 --> 00:01:10,376
THIS IS THE ESCALATION.

42
00:01:10,376 --> 00:01:13,212
IRAN HAS SAID IF IT RAINS IN OUR

43
00:01:13,212 --> 00:01:15,147
COUNTRY, IT WILL POUR IN YOURS.

44
00:01:15,147 --> 00:01:16,248
MANY PEOPLE SAYING THAT'S WHAT

45
00:01:16,248 --> 00:01:18,618
WE SAW LAST NIGHT.

46
00:01:18,618 --> 00:01:22,355
50 TARGETS HIT BY ISRAELI JETS

47
00:01:22,355 --> 00:01:25,324
TAKING OUT THE IRANIAN BASES IN

48
00:01:25,324 --> 00:01:25,691
SYRIA.

49
00:01:25,691 --> 00:01:27,660
A VERY SIGNIFICANT EVENING LAST

50
00:01:27,660 --> 00:01:28,094
NIGHT, SHEP.

51
00:01:28,094 --> 00:01:29,495
>> Shepard: WHAT ARE WE LEARNING

52
00:01:29,495 --> 00:01:31,197
ART THE REPORTS OF THE ROCKETS

53
00:01:31,197 --> 00:01:32,665
THAT PRECIPITATED?

54
00:01:32,665 --> 00:01:34,934
THE REPORTS THAT THE IRANIANS

55
00:01:34,934 --> 00:01:36,802
FIRED INTO ISRAELI TERRITORY?

56
00:01:36,802 --> 00:01:39,038
>> THIS IS HOW THIS STARTED OFF

57
00:01:39,038 --> 00:01:40,940
JUST AFTER MIDNIGHT.

58
00:01:40,940 --> 00:01:42,575
REPORTS OF ABOUT 20 ROCKETS

59
00:01:42,575 --> 00:01:47,013
FIRED BUT I RAINIANS.

60
00:01:47,013 --> 00:01:48,514
THE SYRIAN GOVERNMENT TRIED TO

61
00:01:48,514 --> 00:01:49,649
DISTANCE THEMSELVES FROM THIS

62
00:01:49,649 --> 00:01:49,949
MOVE.

63
00:01:49,949 --> 00:01:51,417
ALTHOUGH THE ROCKETS WERE FIRED

64
00:01:51,417 --> 00:01:54,053
FROM INSIDE SYRIAN TERRITORY,

65
00:01:54,053 --> 00:01:58,658
THEY SAID THEY HAD NO PART TO

66
00:01:58,658 --> 00:01:58,958
PLAY.

67
00:01:58,958 --> 00:02:01,227
THAT'S BECAUSE NETANYAHU SAID IF

68
00:02:01,227 --> 00:02:05,464
SYRIA IS HELPING LAUNCH ATTACKS,

69
00:02:05,464 --> 00:02:08,701
WE WILL GET INVOLVED IN SYRIA.

70
00:02:08,701 --> 00:02:09,801
NOBODY WANTS THAT.

71
00:02:09,801 --> 00:02:11,737
SO IT WAS INTERESTING TO SEE

72
00:02:11,737 --> 00:02:13,639
BENJAMIN NETANYAHU MEETING WITH

73
00:02:13,639 --> 00:02:15,174
PRESIDENT PUTIN IN MOSCOW AND

74
00:02:15,174 --> 00:02:16,509
THOUGHT THAT HE WAS GOING TO ASK

75
00:02:16,509 --> 00:02:18,377
PRESIDENT PUTIN TO REIGN IN HIS

76
00:02:18,377 --> 00:02:21,013
ALLIES IN SYRIA, THE IRANIANS

77
00:02:21,013 --> 00:02:22,915
AND PERSUADE THEM NOT TO LAUNCH

78
00:02:22,915 --> 00:02:23,549
ATTACKS LIKE THAT.

79
00:02:23,549 --> 00:02:26,752
THE FACT THAT THEY DID IT

80
00:02:26,752 --> 00:02:27,653
ANYWAY, HOW MUCH INFLUENCE DOES

81
00:02:27,653 --> 00:02:33,125
RUSSIA HAVE OVER THE IRANIANS.

82
00:02:33,125 --> 00:02:34,293
THERE'S REPORTS WHETHER THEY

83
00:02:34,293 --> 00:02:36,429
WERE OPERATING WITH CONSENT FROM

84
00:02:36,429 --> 00:02:36,729
IRAN.

85
00:02:36,729 --> 00:02:37,496
THEY DON'T KNOW.

86
00:02:37,496 --> 00:02:39,865
SO A LOT OF MOVING PIECES OVER

87
00:02:39,865 --> 00:02:40,166
HERE.

88
00:02:40,166 --> 00:02:43,936
THIS IS A GEO POLITICAL

89
00:02:43,936 --> 00:00:00,000
CAULDRON, A MESS.
