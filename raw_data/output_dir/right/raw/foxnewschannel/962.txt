1
00:00:00,629 --> 00:00:01,296
WITH SIMON JOURNALISTS FOOD

2
00:00:01,296 --> 00:00:02,698
ANNOUNCED TRUMP WHEN HE WAS

3
00:00:02,698 --> 00:00:04,299
EXCHANGING NUCLEAR THREATS WITH

4
00:00:04,299 --> 00:00:05,701
KIM NOW SEEM UNWILLING TO GIVE

5
00:00:05,701 --> 00:00:06,301
THEM A CHANCE.

6
00:00:06,301 --> 00:00:07,369
>> Shannon: THANK YOU VERY

7
00:00:07,369 --> 00:00:07,936
MUCH.

8
00:00:07,936 --> 00:00:09,004
ONE OF THE PRESIDENT'S FIRST

9
00:00:09,004 --> 00:00:10,272
CALLS AFTER THE SUMMIT WAS TO

10
00:00:10,272 --> 00:00:12,941
OUR NEXT GUEST IN SOME OF HIS

11
00:00:12,941 --> 00:00:15,510
COLLEAGUES ON CAPITOL HILL.

12
00:00:15,510 --> 00:00:16,244
REPUBLICAN SENATOR JOHN BARRASSO

13
00:00:16,244 --> 00:00:18,046
FROM WYOMING SITS ON THE SENATE

00:00:18,046 --> 00:00:18,780
FOREIGN RELATIONS COMMITTEE AND

15
00:00:18,780 --> 00:00:22,317
YOU CHATTED WITH THE PRESIDENT.

16
00:00:22,317 --> 00:00:22,851
HOW DID HE SOUND?

17
00:00:22,851 --> 00:00:26,922
>> OPTIMISTIC.

18
00:00:26,922 --> 00:00:28,890
CONGRATULATIONS TO THE

19
00:00:28,890 --> 00:00:29,257
PRESIDENT.

20
00:00:29,257 --> 00:00:30,659
THIS WAS A HISTORIC AND

21
00:00:30,659 --> 00:00:31,359
IMPORTANT FIRST STEP IN THESE

22
00:00:31,359 --> 00:00:35,097
ONGOING DISCUSSIONS TO ELIMINATE

23
00:00:35,097 --> 00:00:35,697
NUCLEAR WEAPONS FROM

24
00:00:35,697 --> 00:00:36,298
NORTH KOREA.

25
00:00:36,298 --> 00:00:38,100
THE PRESIDENT FELT HE HAD MADE

26
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:39,301
PROGRESS AND HE IS STILL VERY

27
00:00:39,301 --> 00:00:40,902
CLEAR EYED ABOUT THIS.

28
00:00:40,902 --> 00:00:44,005
WERE GOING TO HAVE TO SEE WHAT

29
00:00:44,005 --> 00:00:44,473
HAPPENS.

30
00:00:44,473 --> 00:00:45,640
MIKE POMPEO AS WELL AS

31
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:46,575
JOHN BOLTON WILL BE MEETING WITH

32
00:00:46,575 --> 00:00:48,210
THE NORTH KOREANS NEXT WEEK TO

33
00:00:48,210 --> 00:00:48,777
TAKE THE NEXT STEP.

34
00:00:48,777 --> 00:00:52,214
WE NEED TO MAKE SURE WE HAVE

35
00:00:52,214 --> 00:00:53,281
SOMETHING VERIFIABLE AND

36
00:00:53,281 --> 00:00:53,982
ENFORCEABLE AND ACCOMPLISHES

37
00:00:53,982 --> 00:01:01,823
WHAT WE NEED FOR AMERICA'S

38
00:01:01,823 --> 00:01:02,491
SECURITY AND SAFETY AT HOME

39
00:01:02,491 --> 00:01:03,158
WHICH IS NORTH KOREA WITH NO

40
00:01:03,158 --> 00:01:03,625
NUCLEAR WEAPONS.

41
00:01:03,625 --> 00:01:04,325
>> Shannon: YOU KNOW THAT IT'S

42
00:01:04,325 --> 00:01:04,926
WHAT CRITICS HAVE SAID.

43
00:01:04,926 --> 00:01:08,330
THAT THERE ISN'T THAT FRAMEWORK.

44
00:01:08,330 --> 00:01:11,299
ALL THE THINGS CRITICAL TO THIS.

45
00:01:11,299 --> 00:01:12,033
ONE OF YOUR DEMOCRATIC

46
00:01:12,033 --> 00:01:12,701
COLLEAGUES CHUCK SCHUMER HAD

47
00:01:12,701 --> 00:01:15,904
THIS TO SAY.

48
00:01:15,904 --> 00:01:19,441
>> THE BOTTOM LINE IS THIS: WHAT

49
00:01:19,441 --> 00:01:20,809
THE UNITED STATES HAS GAINED IS

50
00:01:20,809 --> 00:01:26,047
VAGUE AND UNVIABLE --

51
00:01:26,047 --> 00:01:26,481
UNVERIFIABLE.

52
00:01:26,481 --> 00:01:28,517
WE HOPE THIS DOESN'T CONTINUE.

53
00:01:28,517 --> 00:01:29,651
>> Shannon: WORK FOR SECRETARY

54
00:01:29,651 --> 00:01:34,022
POMPEO AND OTHER STAFFERS TO DO

55
00:01:34,022 --> 00:01:34,689
IN GETTING SOMETHING DONE.

56
00:01:34,689 --> 00:01:35,657
HOW DID THEY GO ABOUT IT IN A

57
00:01:35,657 --> 00:01:39,161
WAY THAT WILL SATISFY THE

58
00:01:39,161 --> 00:01:41,530
PRESIDENT'S CRITICS, OR CAN THEY

59
00:01:41,530 --> 00:01:42,063
PRESIDENT'S CRITICS, OR CAN THE

60
00:01:42,063 --> 00:01:42,364
THEY?

61
00:01:42,364 --> 00:01:44,399
>> SOME CREDITS YOU WILL NEVER

62
00:01:44,399 --> 00:01:45,100
SATISFY.

63
00:01:45,100 --> 00:01:46,301
WHEN THE PRESIDENT SET UP THE

64
00:01:46,301 --> 00:01:47,702
SUMMIT, THEY CRITICIZED HIM AND

65
00:01:47,702 --> 00:01:49,638
WHEN HE CANCELED THE SUMMIT THEY

66
00:01:49,638 --> 00:01:50,172
CRITICIZED HIM.

67
00:01:50,172 --> 00:01:51,807
WHEN HE WENT AHEAD WITH THE

68
00:01:51,807 --> 00:01:53,942
SUMMIT, THEY CRITICIZED HIM

69
00:01:53,942 --> 00:01:54,476
STILL.

70
00:01:54,476 --> 00:01:55,377
WE TALKED ABOUT WHAT THE

71
00:01:55,377 --> 00:01:57,679
PRESIDENT WAS WHEN HE CAME INTO

72
00:01:57,679 --> 00:01:58,380
OFFICE, BARACK OBAMA SAID WE

73
00:01:58,380 --> 00:02:00,315
WERE ON THE VERGE OF WAR WITH

74
00:02:00,315 --> 00:02:01,316
NORTH KOREA.

75
00:02:01,316 --> 00:02:04,886
AT THAT TIME, WE WERE.

76
00:02:04,886 --> 00:02:05,921
WE SAW IN NORTH KOREA'S

77
00:02:05,921 --> 00:02:06,888
SOPHISTICATION.

78
00:02:06,888 --> 00:02:07,522
IT INCREASED DRAMATICALLY.

79
00:02:07,522 --> 00:02:09,124
NOW LOOK AT WHERE WE ARE TODAY.

80
00:02:09,124 --> 00:02:12,294
AS A RESULT OF THE SUMMIT, THE

81
00:02:12,294 --> 00:02:14,729
WORLD IS MORE SAFE, MORE SECURE,

82
00:02:14,729 --> 00:02:17,132
MORE STABLE THAN IT WAS

83
00:02:17,132 --> 00:02:17,532
BEFOREHAND.

84
00:02:17,532 --> 00:02:19,701
WE HAVE A LOT OF WORK TO DO AND

85
00:02:19,701 --> 00:02:21,236
I WANT SOMETHING THAT ACTUALLY

86
00:02:21,236 --> 00:02:24,472
CAN BE A TREATY WITH THE ARAD

87
00:02:24,472 --> 00:02:25,207
AGREEMENT FELL APART, TERRIBLE

88
00:02:25,207 --> 00:02:27,843
AGREEMENT BUT IT WAS NEVER

89
00:02:27,843 --> 00:02:28,543
BROUGHT TO THE ELECTED MEMBERS

90
00:02:28,543 --> 00:02:30,145
OF THE UNITED STATES SENATE

91
00:02:30,145 --> 00:02:32,047
REPRESENTING THE PEOPLE OF THE

92
00:02:32,047 --> 00:02:34,916
COUNTRY.

93
00:02:34,916 --> 00:02:37,118
INSTEAD, THEY TOOK IT TO THE

94
00:02:37,118 --> 00:02:37,919
UNITED NATIONS.

95
00:02:37,919 --> 00:02:38,920
I WANT SOMETHING WITH

96
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:39,788
NORTH KOREA WE CAN TAKE TO THE

97
00:02:39,788 --> 00:02:42,324
U.S. SENATE AND GET CONFIRMED AS

98
00:02:42,324 --> 00:02:42,691
A TREATY.

99
00:02:42,691 --> 00:02:47,095
THAT'S HOW YOU HAVE LASTING

100
00:02:47,095 --> 00:02:47,529
RELATIONSHIPS.

101
00:02:47,529 --> 00:02:48,163
>> Shannon: THE PRESIDENT

102
00:02:48,163 --> 00:02:49,097
TONIGHT SAYING THAT'S ABSOLUTELY

103
00:02:49,097 --> 00:02:51,166
WHAT HE WANTS TO DO AND THAT'S

104
00:02:51,166 --> 00:02:52,901
HIS GOAL THAT YOU CAN VOTE ON

105
00:02:52,901 --> 00:02:55,737
THAT WILL BE BINDING THAT

106
00:02:55,737 --> 00:02:58,173
HOPEFULLY HAS BIPARTISAN

107
00:02:58,173 --> 00:02:58,506
BACKING.

108
00:02:58,506 --> 00:03:11,119
WE TALKED, HOWIE DID AND WE

109
00:03:11,119 --> 00:03:11,720
REFERENCE SENATOR RUBIO.

110
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:12,387
HE SAID "I TOO HAVE CONCERNS

111
00:03:12,387 --> 00:03:13,121
ABOUT HOW THIS WILL TURN OUT BUT

112
00:03:13,121 --> 00:03:13,755
I DON'T RECALL THE EXPERTS

113
00:03:13,755 --> 00:03:14,456
CRITICIZING OBAMA WHEN HE MET

114
00:03:14,456 --> 00:03:15,223
WITH THE BRUTAL DICTATOR IN CUBA

115
00:03:15,223 --> 00:03:15,957
WHO OVERSAW A POLICE STATE AND

116
00:03:15,957 --> 00:03:20,528
KILLED IN JAIL HIS OPPONENTS.

117
00:03:20,528 --> 00:03:23,098
#DoubleStandard.

118
00:03:23,098 --> 00:03:25,233
>> HE'S THOUGHTFUL ON THESE

119
00:03:25,233 --> 00:03:27,669
ISSUES, SPENT SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT

120
00:03:27,802 --> 00:03:29,738
PRESIDENT GAVE UP NOTHING.

121
00:03:29,738 --> 00:03:32,107
HE COULD HAVE PUSHED THE PAUSE

122
00:03:32,107 --> 00:03:34,109
BUTTON ON SOME OF THESE MILITARY

123
00:03:34,109 --> 00:03:35,543
EXERCISES BUT WE ONLY DO TWO A

124
00:03:35,543 --> 00:03:35,844
YEAR.

125
00:03:35,844 --> 00:03:38,346
WE DID ONE IN THE SPRING.

126
00:03:38,346 --> 00:03:41,082
THIS ONE, FOR MONTHS TO COME.

127
00:03:41,082 --> 00:03:42,284
IT WOULD BE EASY TO PUT THAT ON.

128
00:03:42,284 --> 00:03:43,318
I THINK THE PRESIDENT IS GIVING

129
00:03:43,318 --> 00:03:45,687
UP NOTHING.

130
00:03:45,687 --> 00:03:47,489
WE'VE SHOWN IS THAT MAXIMUM

131
00:03:47,489 --> 00:03:47,956
PRESSURE WORKS.

132
00:03:47,956 --> 00:03:50,125
TOUGH TALK BY THE PRESIDENT

133
00:03:50,125 --> 00:03:51,526
WORKS.

134
00:03:51,526 --> 00:03:53,461
WE ARE IN MUCH BETTER SHAPE

135
00:03:53,461 --> 00:03:56,097
TODAY THAN WE WERE A BIG DAY

136
00:03:56,097 --> 00:03:58,400
PRESIDENT TRUMP TOOK OFFICE WITH

137
00:03:58,400 --> 00:03:59,868
REGARD TO INTERNATIONAL SECURITY

138
00:03:59,868 --> 00:04:02,504
AND FOCUS SPECIFICALLY.

139
00:04:02,504 --> 00:04:03,371
WE KNOW NUCLEAR WEAPONS IN THE

140
00:04:03,371 --> 00:04:05,240
HANDS OF NORTH KOREA MAKES THE

141
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:07,042
WORLD LESS SAFE AND LESS STABLE

142
00:04:07,042 --> 00:04:09,311
AND LESS SECURE.

143
00:04:09,311 --> 00:00:00,000
>> Shannon: JUST ABOUT
