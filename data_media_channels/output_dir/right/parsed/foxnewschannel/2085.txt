TEN DEMOCRATS DEFENDING A SENATE
SEAT IN A STATE THAT PRESIDENT
TRUMP WON.
MIKE GIBBONS ON THIS TRAIL
ASKING FOR THE VOTE OF
REPUBLICANS IN OHIO IN THE
PRIMARY.
THANKS FOR BEING HERE.
>> THANKS, LELAND.
LELAND: WHEN I WATCHED THE
INTERVIEW AND OTHER CANDIDATES
IN THE RACE AND I'VE READ SOME
OF YOUR COMMENTS, WHAT STRIKES
ME IS THAT EVERYONE IS TRYING TO
WRAP THEMSELVES IN THE I AM MORE
TRUMP THAN THE NEXT GUY, I'M
MORE OF AN OUTSIDER THAN THE
NEXT GUY.
WHY IS THAT MESSAGE SO IMPORTANT
IN OHIO?
>> I'VE TRAVELED THE 88 COUNTIES
IN THIS STATE AND THE ONE LINE
THAT I GIVE THAT ALWAYS GETS
APPLAUSE IS I'M NOT A
POLITICIAN.
I'VE NEVER RUN FOR OFFICE
BEFORE.
I'M TIRED OF THE CAREER
POLITICIANS WE HAVE IN
WASHINGTON AND THAT'S WHY I'M
RUNNING.
LELAND: THAT'S WHY YOU'RE
RUNNING.
HOW DOES IT -- WHY DO YOU THINK
THAT RESONATES?
>> I THINK THAT EVERYBODY ELSE
IS TIRED OF THEM, ALSO, AND I
MEAN, YOU KNOW, I THINK I'VE GOT
THE OPINION--
MY OWN OPINION IS THE OPINION OF
MOST PEOPLE IN THE STATE OF
OHIO.
LELAND: IS THE ARGUMENT ON THE
FLIP SIDE, IN ORDER TO SOMETIMES
CHANGE SOMETHING THAT IS AS
PROFOUNDLY SCREWED UP AS
WASHINGTON IS AND THERE'S PRETTY
MUCH AGREEMENT ON THAT FACT, YOU
HAVE TO KNOW A LITTLE BIT HOW IT
WORKS AND IN A WAY, PRESIDENT
TRUMP HAS LEARNED THAT HIMSELF
IN 18 MONTHS.
>> HE'S RUN MONTH.
I THINK WE HAVE TO CHANGE THE
ROSTER IN THE U.S. SENATE, HAVE
MORE PEOPLE WHO AREN'T TRYING TO
KEEP THE SYSTEM THEY'RE USING
RIGHT NOW IN PLACE.
IN EVERYBODY'S PUSHING TO KEEP
POWER AND THEY'RE ALL WORKING
WITH EACH OTHER, WHICH IS THE
CASE IN MY ELECTION HERE, YOU'RE
NEVER GOING TO CHANGE IT.
LELAND: IT IS NOTEWORTHY THAT
THE PRESIDENT, WHO IS THE
NON-POLITICIAN POLITICIAN HAS
ENDORSED SOMEBODY WHO IS A
POLITICIAN IN THIS RACE, THAT'S
CONGRESSMAN RENACCI, WHO IS WITH
THE PRESIDENT RIGHT NOW AND HERE
IS HIS INTERVIEW YESTERDAY WITH
BILL HEMMER.
>> MIKE GIBBONS AND OTHERS
RUNNING IN THIS RACE WANT TO
TALK ABOUT THE OUTSIDER AND THEY
WANT TO SAY I'M THE INSIDER,
THEY'RE THE 0 OUTSIDER.
I'M IN BUSINESS AND I'M STILL A
C.P.A. AND PRETTY MUCH BRINGING
MY 30 YEARS OF BUSINESS
EXPERIENCE TO WASHINGTON.
I KNOW THAT'S WHAT THE PRESIDENT
LIKES, AND I ALSO KNOW THAT'S
WHAT THE PEOPLE LIKE, AND I DO
HAVE NOW A COUPLE OF YEARS IN
THE HOUSE TO UNDERSTAND HOW
WASHINGTON IS BROKEN TO GET A
HEAD START ON IT IN THE SENATE.
LELAND: ALL RIGHT.
SO YOU BOTH AGREE THAT PEOPLE IN
OHIO WANT SOMEBODY WHO IS NOT A
POLITICIAN.
LELAND: BUT I SAW YOU LAUGHING
DURING THAT CLIP.
>> WELL, HE WAS A LOBBYIST
BEFORE HE RAN FOR CONGRESS.
HE'S BEEN IN FOUR TERMS IN THE
16TH DISTRICT, CONGRESSIONAL
DISTRICT FROM OHIO.
HE IS--
HE HAS RUN FOR THREE OFFICES IN
THE LAST TWO YEARS.
HE STARTED RUNNING FOR GOVERNOR.
AND BY THE WAY, YOU KNOW, THE
NARRATIVE IS THAT PRESIDENT
TRUMP CHOSE HIM.
MITCH MCCONNELL RECRUITED HIM,
CONTRIBUTES TO HIS CAMPAIGN AND
ARRANGED FOR THE PRESIDENT TO
SUPPORT HIM.
I WAS DONALD TRUMP'S FUND
RAISING CO-CHAIRMAN IN THIS
STATE, GAVE HIM THE LARGEST
GIVEN TO A CANDIDATE.
AND HE OFFERED ME A JOB IN THE
ADMINISTRATION.
AND MADE 800 CALLS FOR HIM AND
HE THINK HITS AGENDA IS
IMPORTANT AND I STILL DO.
LELAND: HOW ABOUT THE AGENDA--
WHAT'S IMPORTANT FOR OHIO AND
HIS AGENDA.
>> AS THE COUNTRY GOES, OHIO
GOES.
YOU KNOW, WE'VE HAD EIGHT YEARS
OF A PRESIDENT THAT MADE EVERY
SMALL BUSINESS MAN IN THIS
COUNTRY FEEL UNWORTHY.
I MEAN, YOU DIDN'T DO IT ON YOUR
OWN.
I'M A GUY WHO STARTED A BUSINESS
28 YEARS AGO AND REMEMBER THE 20
HOUR DAYS AND I STILL HAVE THEM
FROM TIME TO TIME.
HE MADE ME FEEL LIKE I HAD NOT
ACCOMPLISHED ANYTHING, MADE ME
FEEL LIKE WHAT I HAD DONE WAS
REALLY JUST, OTHER PEOPLE DOING
IT.
DONALD TRUMP UNDERSTANDS WHAT IT
TAKES TO RUN A BUSINESS, TO
START A BUSINESS AND WHETHER THE
DEMOCRATS--
>> DO YOU THINK HE AND FOR THAT
MATTER YOU UNDERSTAND THOUGH
WHAT IT'S LIKE TO WORK IN THOSE
BUSINESSES, WHAT IT'S LIKE TO
WORK ON THE FACTORY FLOORS THAT
EXIST IN OHIO OR THE
DISTRIBUTION CENTERS?
>> I CAN TELL YOU THIS, I WILL
BE THE ONLY SENATOR THAT CAN
FINISH A DRIVEWAY IF I GET
THERE.
MY FAMILY WAS A WORKING CLASS
FAMILY, I HAVE BEEN VERY BLESSED
ONE OF THE REASONS I'M RUNNING
RIGHT NOW.
HAD A SUN WHO JOINED THE
MILITARY, NAVAL AVIATOR.
LELAND: CONGRATULATIONS, WE
THANK HIM.
>> AND I FELT I NEEDED TO
CONTRIBUTE AND THIS IS MY SHOT
AT DOING IT.
LELAND: AND AS THEY SAY, THIS IS
IN THE YOKE WHO FOUNDED THIS
