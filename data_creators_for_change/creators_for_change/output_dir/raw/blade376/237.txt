1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,280
the past couple of weeks I've really

2
00:00:02,280 --> 00:00:04,529
tried hard to make a new video and it's

3
00:00:04,529 --> 00:00:06,660
not gone very well I've had<font color="#E5E5E5"> five videos</font>

4
00:00:06,660 --> 00:00:09,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">I've wanted to make I filmed many times</font>

5
00:00:09,570 --> 00:00:11,460
I've edits them many times and it

6
00:00:11,460 --> 00:00:13,679
doesn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> seem to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> work I think some people</font>

7
00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:16,590
tend to misunderstand with video

8
00:00:16,590 --> 00:00:19,109
creators that they think<font color="#CCCCCC"> that they still</font>

9
00:00:19,109 --> 00:00:21,480
force our ideas some people are able to

10
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:24,630
do that but for me it's just<font color="#E5E5E5"> when st.</font>

11
00:00:24,630 --> 00:00:27,720
inspires me to do something<font color="#E5E5E5"> and the past</font>

12
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:30,300
couple weeks haven't gone<font color="#E5E5E5"> goes I've</font>

13
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:33,510
liked a lot of inspiration and I thought

14
00:00:33,510 --> 00:00:35,899
I'd<font color="#E5E5E5"> just give it a break for a while and</font>

15
00:00:35,899 --> 00:00:38,910
the same happened<font color="#CCCCCC"> recently and it's</font>

16
00:00:38,910 --> 00:00:40,469
inspired me to do a video or something

17
00:00:40,469 --> 00:00:43,200
so I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> now and I'm frame the</font>

18
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:46,739
question<font color="#E5E5E5"> out there and I don't know I'm</font>

19
00:00:46,739 --> 00:00:47,969
just going to talk and see what happens

20
00:00:47,969 --> 00:00:50,370
and hopefully it's something that's

21
00:00:50,370 --> 00:00:52,440
provocative and it'd<font color="#E5E5E5"> be nice to hear</font>

22
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:58,559
your opinions<font color="#CCCCCC"> How well</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> do you know</font>

23
00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:01,710
yourself now we all like to think that

24
00:01:01,710 --> 00:01:03,750
we do know ourselves very well but there

25
00:01:03,750 --> 00:01:05,369
are times in which we put in particular

26
00:01:05,369 --> 00:01:07,350
situations perhaps ones we haven't faced

27
00:01:07,350 --> 00:01:10,920
before in which we experience feelings

28
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:14,369
emotions that we<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't usually and</font>

29
00:01:14,369 --> 00:01:17,909
therefore we take<font color="#E5E5E5"> action in ways that</font>

30
00:01:17,909 --> 00:01:21,360
we're not used to I'm doing and their

31
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:24,390
form a question in this video is have

32
00:01:24,390 --> 00:01:28,020
you ever surprised yourself and our

33
00:01:28,020 --> 00:01:30,060
first<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of people may think I was I'm</font>

34
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:31,290
sure we surprised ourselves all<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

35
00:01:31,290 --> 00:01:32,939
times but<font color="#E5E5E5"> when you think of what that</font>

36
00:01:32,939 --> 00:01:35,790
actually means that you've surprised

37
00:01:35,790 --> 00:01:38,939
yourself you may then find it's quite a

38
00:01:38,939 --> 00:01:44,729
surreal thing to think about now last

39
00:01:44,729 --> 00:01:47,700
night I was facing<font color="#E5E5E5"> a situation that I</font>

40
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:51,149
never saw coming why didn't see is

41
00:01:51,149 --> 00:01:54,930
likely anyway and it happens I'm not

42
00:01:54,930 --> 00:01:59,390
going into the details but the point was

43
00:02:00,229 --> 00:02:04,079
it devastated me it is tore me apart but

44
00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:06,149
with the person it was with and with the

45
00:02:06,149 --> 00:02:09,149
situation for some reason there was all

46
00:02:09,149 --> 00:02:11,849
this anger inside me but I was able to

47
00:02:11,849 --> 00:02:13,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">stay</font>

48
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,720
calm and deal with it and forgive on the

49
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:19,030
spot<font color="#CCCCCC"> if forgiveness is the right word</font>

50
00:02:19,030 --> 00:02:21,040
you know I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think it's all subjective in</font>

51
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:24,280
situations on in some cases of you know

52
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:28,330
if someone<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in the right</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> all wrong by</font>

53
00:02:28,330 --> 00:02:30,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">Saul forgave there and I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just got on</font>

54
00:02:30,250 --> 00:02:33,030
with it<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's the next day and it's</font>

55
00:02:33,030 --> 00:02:35,740
slowly going back to<font color="#CCCCCC"> normal but the</font>

56
00:02:35,740 --> 00:02:39,130
point is I<font color="#CCCCCC"> surprised myself I look back</font>

57
00:02:39,130 --> 00:02:44,290
I wonder why I'm angry with myself I'm

58
00:02:44,290 --> 00:02:50,500
wondering<font color="#CCCCCC"> why</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I her so bad yeah are able</font>

59
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:54,190
to sort of get on with it<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you hear</font>

60
00:02:54,190 --> 00:02:55,600
on the news sometimes and this is

61
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:57,489
something which is completely unrelated

62
00:02:57,489 --> 00:03:00,370
I'm not comparing it I guess it's a much

63
00:03:00,370 --> 00:03:02,620
bigger scale here these people who maybe

64
00:03:02,620 --> 00:03:04,780
have lost a relative because they<font color="#E5E5E5"> got</font>

65
00:03:04,780 --> 00:03:06,400
murdered and then you find<font color="#E5E5E5"> that they</font>

66
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:08,530
forgive the murderer and a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> people</font>

67
00:03:08,530 --> 00:03:11,440
sit back and go you know they're crazy

68
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:14,050
what the hell are thinking but you know

69
00:03:14,050 --> 00:03:14,890
if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of it for another</font>

70
00:03:14,890 --> 00:03:17,200
perspective is a truly great thing

71
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:19,269
forgiveness is a great thing a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

72
00:03:19,269 --> 00:03:21,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">people tend to relate forgiveness in a</font>

73
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:24,310
religious context I believe that<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be</font>

74
00:03:24,310 --> 00:03:26,290
the case anyway but<font color="#E5E5E5"> even so with a</font>

75
00:03:26,290 --> 00:03:28,630
<font color="#CCCCCC">situation where I have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> felt so much pain</font>

76
00:03:28,630 --> 00:03:33,390
and I have found it so difficult I

77
00:03:34,260 --> 00:03:39,940
<font color="#CCCCCC">surprised myself I'm still looking by</font>

78
00:03:39,940 --> 00:03:41,560
now on well I'm still surprised at

79
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:44,590
myself now of how I'm hoping because I

80
00:03:44,590 --> 00:03:47,980
know on a strong person but when you

81
00:03:47,980 --> 00:03:51,220
strongly feel about something and that

82
00:03:51,220 --> 00:03:53,560
is torn apart and something<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you</font>

83
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:59,620
were so sure about has disappeared out

84
00:03:59,620 --> 00:04:07,750
of your hands it shocked me and I shot

85
00:04:07,750 --> 00:04:09,790
myself as a result and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I surprised</font>

86
00:04:09,790 --> 00:04:13,390
myself so my question<font color="#CCCCCC"> to you here to</font>

87
00:04:13,390 --> 00:04:15,730
watch now there is have you<font color="#CCCCCC"> ever done</font>

88
00:04:15,730 --> 00:04:16,899
something all been<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the situation</font>

89
00:04:16,899 --> 00:04:19,978
where you've come out<font color="#E5E5E5"> the other side</font>

90
00:04:19,978 --> 00:04:22,390
it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> necessarily with you being a</font>

91
00:04:22,390 --> 00:04:23,490
better person

92
00:04:23,490 --> 00:04:25,110
but have<font color="#CCCCCC"> you ever surprise yourself in</font>

93
00:04:25,110 --> 00:04:26,430
it could be a negative thing where you

94
00:04:26,430 --> 00:04:27,840
may have lashed out and you think that's

95
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:29,880
<font color="#CCCCCC">on like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you but the point is you may</font>

96
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:33,030
know yourself so so very well but when

97
00:04:33,030 --> 00:04:36,080
you're in a new situation in the unknown

98
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:38,009
something else may come out which

99
00:04:38,009 --> 00:04:41,910
surprises you so I'm interested<font color="#E5E5E5"> to hear</font>

100
00:04:41,910 --> 00:00:00,000
your thoughts
