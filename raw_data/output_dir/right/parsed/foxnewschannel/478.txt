THE SOUTH LAWN FOR WEST VIRGINIA
SPEAKING TO REPORTERS.
LET'S LISTEN.
>> I WOULD EXPECT IT'S GOING TO
TURN OUT VERY WELL FOR THE
JUDGE.
THERE'S NEVER BEEN ANYBODY
THAT'S BEEN LOOKED AT LIKE JUDGE
KAVANAUGH.
I THINK IT'S GOING TO WORK OUT
OR VERY WELL.
BUT THE FBI, I BELIEVE, IS DOING
A REALLY GREAT JOB.
THEY HAVE BEEN ALL OVER ALREADY.
>> 
>> YEAH, THEY HAVE FREE REIN.
THEY'RE GOING TO DO WHATEVER
THEY HAVE TO DO.
WHATEVER IT IS THEY DO, THEY'LL
BE DOING THINGS THAT WE NEVER
EVEN THOUGHT OF.
AND HOPEFULLY AT THE CONCLUSION,
EVERYTHING WILL BE FINE.
>> WHAT?
>> 
>> YEAH, I DO CAN, I THINK HE'S
GREAT.
I DON'T THINK THERE'S EVER BEEN
ANY PERSON THAT'S BEEN UNDER
SCRUTINY LIKE HE HAS BEEN.
I THINK IT'S BEEN A VERY TOUGH
PROCESS.
BUT HE'S A GOOD MAN, HE'S A
GREAT JUDGE.
THIS IS A GREAT JUDGE.
HIGHLY RESPECTED FOR MANY, MANY
YEARS, AT THE TOP OF THE LIST,
AND I HOPE EVERYTHING WORKS OUT
GREAT.
BUT I WILL SAY THERE ARE A LOT
OF PEOPLE GOING OUT RIGHT NOW
WORKING VERY HARD.
I'M GOING TO WEST VIRGINIA, WE
HAVE A BIG CROWD, MANY OF YOU
ARE GOING, AND WE'RE GOING TO
HAVE A LOT OF FUN.
WE'RE GOING TO HAVE A RALLY, AND
IT'S GOING TO BE A LOT OF FUN.
>> 
>> WELL, I THINK WE HAVE A CLOSE
RACE.
THAT'S GOING TO BE A RACE.
WE HAVE A LOT OF CLOSE RACES.
WE HAVE RACES, AS AN EXAMPLE IN
THE SENATE, WE'RE HAVING RACES
THAT NOBODY THOUGHT WERE
POSSIBLE AND NOW THEY'RE TIED.
AND, ACTUALLY, REPUBLICANS ARE
WINNING.
AND I REALLY BELIEVE WHEN THE
PUBLIC LOOKS AT THE SITUATION
THAT'S TAKEN PLACE OVER THE LAST
THREE OR FOUR DAYS AND WATCH THE
DEMOCRATS HOW THEY'RE ACTING SO
TERRIBLY, SO DISHONESTLY,
KEEPING PAPERS AND DOCUMENTS,
NOT RELEASING THEM UNTIL AFTER
HEARINGS ARE OVER, I REALLY
THINK THE REPUBLICANS ARE
PICKING UP A LOT.
I REALLY BELIEVE THAT.
I'LL SEE YOU --
>> I WILL SEE YOU IN WEST
VIRGINIA.
>> 
>> WELL, I THINK IT'S FINE.
I THINK, ACTUALLY, THIS COULD BE
A BLESSING IN DISGUISE, BECAUSE
HAVING THE FBI GO OUT, DO THE A
THOROUGH INVESTIGATION WHETHER
IT'S THREE DAYS OR SEVEN DAYS, I
THINK IT'S GOING TO BE THE LESS
THAN A WEEK, BUT HAVING THEM DO
THE A THOROUGH INVESTIGATION, I
ACTUALLY THINK IT'LL BE A
BLESSING IN DISGUISE.
IT'LL BE A GOOD THING.
I'LL SEE YOU IN --
>> 
>> I DON'T HAVE ANY -- I DON'T
NEED A BACKUP PLAN.
WE'LL SEE WHAT HAPPENS.
I THINK HE'S GOING TO BE FINE.
AGAIN, ONE OF THE MOST RESPECTED
MEN AND CERTAINLY ONE OF THE
MOST RESPECTED JURISTS OR JUDGES
IN THE UNITED STATES.
>> 
>> OH, I THINK SHE WAS.
BUT WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO FIND
OUT.
I THINK, FRANKLY, THE FBI HAS A
CHANCE TO REVEAL A LOT OF
DIFFERENT THINGS.
I'D LIKE TO FIND OUT WHO LEAKED
THE PAPERS.
WAS IT SENATOR FEINSTEIN?
BECAUSE, CERTAINLY, HER BODY
LANGUAGE WAS NOT EXACTLY VERY
GOOD WHEN THEY ASKED HER THAT
QUESTION.
SO I WOULD LIKE TO FIND OUT AS
