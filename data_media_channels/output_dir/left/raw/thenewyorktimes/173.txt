00:00:19,360 --> 00:00:21,724
“Kate Spade's really accessible
and it’s, you know,

2
00:00:21,724 --> 00:00:23,140
sort of has a sense
of humor about itself.

3
00:00:23,140 --> 00:00:24,348
It doesn’t take itself too seriously.”

4
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:34,311
“She puts forth a sort
of aspirational line,

5
00:00:34,311 --> 00:00:36,060
which I think, ‘Oh, I
want to be like that.

6
00:00:36,060 --> 00:00:36,601
I want to be chic,

7
00:00:36,601 --> 00:00:39,300
and pulled together,
and a New York lady.’

8
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:40,430
And then I can.”

00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:50,200
“You know,
it was time to get back

10
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:00,000
into the business.”
