so my friend steven crowder has now been suspended from Twitter for violating its hateful conduct terms he's apparently also been suspended from YouTube which is insane right so now they they posted an ex aus by Southwest video of spend computer infiltrating a gender-fluid panel and Twitter suspended Stevens account so they've said that he needs to delete the tweets that violate the rules they've suspended the account for 12 hours okay here's what what Crowder's website is saying here's what we think happened the original video that went out didn't have the word bleep it's it's the the f word for forgave people soft bleep the original video was immediately pulled from YouTube Twitter and Facebook as the studio team added bleeps for the offensive content after the bleeps were added into the video the studio reuploaded the south by south southwest undercover video back to youtube and facebook when knocking jared shared the video with the bleeps added an information blurred he was also suspended which means twitter didn't find that word offensive they've found the general concept of the video offensive so what what exactly is the video so apparently the video is fun computer right a fake character who is forced to crash an LGBTQ gender nonconformity meetup at South by Southwest okay this this tape has now been removed from YouTube it's just a comedy video right it's typical Crowder alright Crowder's the guy does tranny Bane alright this is his shtick he's a comedian comedians do lots of stuff that walks right up to the edge and sometimes crosses over the edge this is a reason that you're gonna be banned from Twitter suspended from Twitter Louis Farrakhan is tweeting openly and Louis Farrakhan is tweeting openly and he's met a crap on Twitter every single day he's not been suspended and his counterparts on the right people like Richard Spencer who I even hesitate to call of the right you know Richard Spencer who is a who is you know so the white version of Louis Farrakhan in verse right Richard Spencer has been suspended from Twitter I don't think he's on Twitter anymore I think he's been banned from Twitter the same thing holds true of Milan apple√≠s now I'm not in favor of any of these people being banned from Twitter even though I despise all of them but I think that it is completely absurd that Steven is getting knocked off these platforms because Steven happens to be a conservative comedian where if you were left-wing comedian and you said exactly the same words about Christians everything would be totally fine you said the same words about Jews everything would be totally fine this double standard that exists in social media is really dangerous it's one of the reasons why Facebook YouTube Twitter at Google all of these outlets seems to be targeting conservative content right now conservative better get on their horse I mean we better start building some of our learning outlets because the reality is that if we don't build some open thread outlets if we don't build some open source outlets that allow people to post what they want to post with some very very minut restrictions then the left will simply castigate everything as hate speech
