00:00:21,244 --> 00:00:21,811
UNEMPLOYMENT RATE.

9
00:00:21,811 --> 00:00:23,079
BUT THE MEDIA MADE IT ALL

00:00:23,079 --> 00:00:23,913

11
00:00:23,913 --> 00:00:25,115

00:00:28,184 --> 00:00:29,419
WHY THE PRESIDENT DECIDED TO

TWEET ABOUT IT BEFOREHAND.

16
00:00:30,487 --> 00:00:32,789
WHY WOULD THE PRESIDENT TELL

17
00:00:32,789 --> 00:00:33,957
ALL OF AMERICA TO LOOK AT

18
00:00:33,957 --> 00:00:34,991

00:00:45,368 --> 00:00:46,369
FIRST TIME THE PRESIDENT HAS

DISTRACTED FROM THE VERY

42
00:01:08,425 --> 00:01:09,392

WE SHOULD ACKNOWLEDGE THAT.

59
00:01:30,647 --> 00:01:32,248
>> DID HE BREAK IT?

60
00:01:32,248 --> 00:01:33,750
HE HINTED IT MIGHT BE OKAY.

61
00:01:33,750 --> 00:01:36,086

00:01:36,086 --> 00:01:36,753
ED: THE WHITE HOUSE ALWAYS

63
00:01:36,753 --> 00:01:39,923
GETS IT THE NIGHT BEFORE.

64
00:01:39,923 --> 00:01:42,025
>> THAT IS NOT THE STORY.

65
00:01:42,025 --> 00:01:42,492
LOOK AT THIS.

66
00:01:42,492 --> 00:01:45,929
THE STORY IS 3.8%

67
00:01:45,929 --> 00:01:46,363
UNEMPLOYMENT.

68
00:01:46,363 --> 00:01:48,431
LOWEST IN A GENERATION.

69
00:01:48,431 --> 00:01:50,166
YOU HAVE NEVER SEEN THAT IN

70
00:01:50,166 --> 00:01:52,769
THIS GENERATION.

71
00:01:52,769 --> 00:01:53,203
3.8%.

72
00:01:53,203 --> 00:01:53,503
5.9%.

73
00:01:53,503 --> 00:01:54,604
THAT'S THE UNEMPLOYMENT RATE

74
00:01:54,604 --> 00:01:56,306
FOR BLACK FOLKS THAT SAN

75
00:01:56,306 --> 00:01:56,973
ALL-TIME LOW.

76
00:01:56,973 --> 00:01:58,942
IT'S NEVER BEEN DOWN AT THAT

77
00:01:58,942 --> 00:01:59,376
LEVEL BEFORE.

78
00:01:59,376 --> 00:02:03,012
SAME STORY FOR HISPANICS.

79
00:02:03,012 --> 00:02:04,414
223 NEW THOUSAND JOBS

80
00:02:04,414 --> 00:02:04,848
CREATED.

81
00:02:04,848 --> 00:02:07,317
YOU ARE ON THE ROAD TO

82
00:02:07,317 --> 00:02:07,784
PROSPERITY.

83
00:02:07,784 --> 00:02:08,585
ED: NOT ACCORDING TO NANCY

84
00:02:08,585 --> 00:02:08,918
PELOSI.

85
00:02:08,918 --> 00:02:10,353
NANCY PELOSI SAID LOOK AT

86
00:02:10,353 --> 00:02:12,122
THIS, MAY'S JOB REPORT SHOWS

87
00:02:12,122 --> 00:02:13,390
THAT STRONG EMPLOYMENT

88
00:02:13,390 --> 00:02:14,758
NUMBERS MEAN LITTLE TO THE

89
00:02:14,758 --> 00:02:16,226
FAMILIES HIT WITH SOARING

90
00:02:16,226 --> 00:02:17,560
NEW COSTS UNDER THE

91
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:18,862
REPUBLICAN'S WATCH.

92
00:02:18,862 --> 00:02:19,796
FIRST SHE WAS TALKING ABOUT

93
00:02:19,796 --> 00:02:20,764
CRUMBS WITH THE TAX CUT.

94
00:02:20,764 --> 00:02:22,332
NOW SHE IS SAYING THESE

95
00:02:22,332 --> 00:02:23,967
NUMBERS DON'T HELP.

96
00:02:23,967 --> 00:02:24,934
ABBY: IS THAT INSULTING?

97
00:02:24,934 --> 00:02:26,336
>> I DON'T KNOW ABOUT

98
00:02:26,336 --> 00:02:26,703
INSULTING.

99
00:02:26,703 --> 00:02:28,338
BUT IT'S A MESSAGE OF

100
00:02:28,338 --> 00:02:28,738
DESPERATION.

101
00:02:28,738 --> 00:02:30,106
THE DEMOCRATS DO NOT HAVE A

102
00:02:30,106 --> 00:02:30,507
GROWTH PLAN.

103
00:02:30,507 --> 00:02:31,307
THEY DON'T HAVE ONE.

104
00:02:31,307 --> 00:02:32,976
SO THEY HAVE TO CRITICIZE

105
00:02:32,976 --> 00:02:34,244
THE PRESIDENT'S GROWTH PLAN

106
00:02:34,244 --> 00:02:35,645
BECAUSE IT IS WORKING.

107
00:02:35,645 --> 00:02:37,247
AND IT IS WORKING.

108
00:02:37,247 --> 00:02:38,748
YOU KNOW, THE PRESIDENT CAME

109
00:02:38,748 --> 00:02:40,250
TO OFFICE SAYING I'M GOING

110
00:02:40,250 --> 00:02:41,718
TO MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN.

111
00:02:41,718 --> 00:02:44,053
AND THE KEYSTONE TO THAT

112
00:02:44,053 --> 00:02:45,221
WHOLE OPERATION WAS

113
00:02:45,221 --> 00:02:46,456
DEREGULATE AND LOWER TAXES.

114
00:02:46,456 --> 00:02:47,357
HE DID BOTH.

115
00:02:47,357 --> 00:02:48,458
AND NOW WE'RE SEEING THE

116
00:02:48,458 --> 00:02:49,793
FRUITS OF THAT.

117
00:02:49,793 --> 00:02:50,994
ABBY: WHAT IS SHE REFERRING

118
00:02:50,994 --> 00:02:51,995
TO THERE IN THAT COMMENT

119
00:02:51,995 --> 00:02:54,030
WHEN SHE SAID IT'S GOING UP

120
00:02:54,030 --> 00:02:54,564
FOR SOME FAMILIES.

121
00:02:54,564 --> 00:02:55,799
>> YOU COULD MAKE THE

122
00:02:55,799 --> 00:02:57,033
ARGUMENT GASOLINE PRICES ARE

123
00:02:57,033 --> 00:02:57,667
UP A LITTLE.

124
00:02:57,667 --> 00:02:58,568
THAT IS TRUE.

125
00:02:58,568 --> 00:03:00,103
YOU CAN MAKE THE ARGUMENT

126
00:03:00,103 --> 00:03:01,070
MORTGAGE RATES ARE UP A

127
00:03:01,070 --> 00:03:01,404
LITTLE.

128
00:03:01,404 --> 00:03:02,172
THAT IS ACCURATE.

129
00:03:02,172 --> 00:03:03,540
SHE COULD MAKE THE ARGUMENT

130
00:03:03,540 --> 00:03:05,074
THAT HEALTHCARE COSTS ARE

131
00:03:05,074 --> 00:03:05,408
RISING.

132
00:03:05,408 --> 00:03:06,109
THAT'S NOT BECAUSE OF

133
00:03:06,109 --> 00:03:06,643
PRESIDENT TRUMP.

134
00:03:06,643 --> 00:03:08,912
THAT IS BECAUSE OF OBAMACARE

135
00:03:08,912 --> 00:03:10,713
LINGERS ON IN OUR ECONOMY.

136
00:03:10,713 --> 00:03:12,248
PETE: SO SHE IS LOOKING FOR

137
00:03:12,248 --> 00:03:13,716
THE LEMONS IN THE LEMONADE

138
00:03:13,716 --> 00:03:14,951
WHICH OF COURSE SHE WOULD DO

139
00:03:14,951 --> 00:03:15,785
BEING IN THE MINORITY.

140
00:03:15,785 --> 00:03:17,587
THEY DO HAVE A GROWTH PLAN.

141
00:03:17,587 --> 00:03:19,055
IT'S A GOVERNMENT GROWTH

142
00:03:19,055 --> 00:03:19,355
PLAN.

143
00:03:19,355 --> 00:03:20,857
HER VIEW IS YOU SOLVE THESE

144
00:03:20,857 --> 00:03:22,058
PROBLEMS BY GROWING

145
00:03:22,058 --> 00:03:23,026
GOVERNMENT PROGRAMS FOR

146
00:03:23,026 --> 00:03:23,359
PEOPLE.

147
00:03:23,359 --> 00:03:26,296
>> STOP IT, PETER.

148
00:03:26,296 --> 00:03:26,896
PETE: IT A GROWTH PLAN.

149
00:03:26,896 --> 00:03:29,165
>> THAT GROWTH PLAN IS TAX

150
00:03:29,165 --> 00:03:29,666
AND SPEND.

151
00:03:29,666 --> 00:03:30,133
PETE: OF COURSE.

152
00:03:30,133 --> 00:03:31,734
>> IT DOES NOT PRODUCE

153
00:03:31,734 --> 00:03:32,235
GROWTH.

154
00:03:32,235 --> 00:03:37,106
IT PRODUCES VIRTUALLY NO

155
00:03:37,106 --> 00:03:39,242
GROWTH FOR A LONG PERIOD OF

156
00:03:39,242 --> 00:03:39,542
TIME.

157
00:03:39,542 --> 00:03:41,277
THE BEST WE GOT IN THE EIGHT

158
00:03:41,277 --> 00:03:43,480
YEARS OF TAX AND SPEND OBAMA

159
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:44,447
YEARS, WAS 2%.

160
00:03:44,447 --> 00:03:45,815
THAT'S ALL WE GOT.

161
00:03:45,815 --> 00:03:48,985
WE HAVE NOW HAD 15 MONTH OF

162
00:03:48,985 --> 00:03:50,053
THE TRUMP ECONOMY AND WE

163
00:03:50,053 --> 00:03:50,753
HAVE 3% GROWTH.

164
00:03:50,753 --> 00:03:52,188
I THINK WE HAVE A VERY GOOD

165
00:03:52,188 --> 00:03:54,123
SHOT AT GOING TO 4% GROWTH

166
00:03:54,123 --> 00:03:56,226
BY THE END OF THIS YEAR.

167
00:03:56,226 --> 00:03:58,528
ON TARGET.

168
00:03:58,528 --> 00:03:59,128
ABBY: I WAS LOOKING AT

169
00:03:59,128 --> 00:03:59,863
NUMBERS LAST NIGHT TO

170
00:03:59,863 --> 00:04:01,331
COMPARE WHERE WE'RE.

171
00:04:01,331 --> 00:04:03,333
YOU FORGET OCTOBER OF

172
00:04:03,333 --> 00:04:04,267
200910% UNEMPLOYMENT.

173
00:04:04,267 --> 00:04:05,235
HOW FAR WE HAVE COME.

174
00:04:05,235 --> 00:04:08,004
>> WE HAVE COME A VERY, LONG

175
00:04:08,004 --> 00:04:08,571
WAY.

176
00:04:08,571 --> 00:04:09,839
ESPECIALLY THE LAST 15, 16

177
00:04:09,839 --> 00:04:11,574
MONTHS OF THE TRUMP'S

178
00:04:11,574 --> 00:04:11,975
PRESIDENCY.

179
00:04:11,975 --> 00:04:12,809
WE ARE ON THE ROAD TO

180
00:04:12,809 --> 00:04:13,209
PROSPERITY.

181
00:04:13,209 --> 00:00:00,000
THE DEMOCRATS CANNOT ADMIT
