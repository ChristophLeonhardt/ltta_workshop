1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:03,019
BETSY DEVOS IS IN CHARGE OF THE
DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION.

2
00:00:03,019 --> 00:00:05,560
HERE'S A PHOTO OF HER TO JOG
YOUR MEMORY.

3
00:00:05,560 --> 00:00:06,560
IT WAS

4
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:09,670
REPORTED ON THE SHOW YESTERDAY
SHE HAD A TOUGH TIME ON 60

5
00:00:09,670 --> 00:00:13,460
MINUTES EXPLAINING AND DEFENDING
HER RECORD WITH MICHIGAN

6
00:00:13,460 --> 00:00:17,010
SCHOOL CHOICE, OPPOSITE LESLIE
STAHL.

7
00:00:17,010 --> 00:00:18,080
HERE'S A REFRESHER.

8
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:20,380
TAKE A LOOK.

9
00:00:20,380 --> 00:00:22,600
NOW HAS THAT HAPPENED IN
MICHIGAN?

10
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:24,690
MICHIGAN IS YOUR HOME
STATE.

11
00:00:24,690 --> 00:00:28,390
YES, THERE'S LOTS OF GREAT
OPTIONS AND CHOICES FOR

12
00:00:28,390 --> 00:00:29,390
STUDENTS.

13
00:00:29,390 --> 00:00:31,980
HAVE THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS IN
MICHIGAN GOTTEN BETTER?

14
00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:32,980
I DON'T KNOW.

15
00:00:32,980 --> 00:00:33,980
OVERALL?

16
00:00:33,980 --> 00:00:35,950
I CAN'T SAY OVERALL
THAT THEY HAVE ALL GOTTEN

17
00:00:35,950 --> 00:00:36,950
BETTER.

18
00:00:36,950 --> 00:00:38,840
THE WHOLE STATE IS NOT DOING
WELL.

19
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:42,400
WELL, THERE CERTAINLY LOTS OF
POCKETS WHERE THE STUDENTS

20
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:43,400
ARE DOING WELL.

21
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:46,750
YOUR ARGUMENT THAT IF YOU
TAKE FUNDS AWAY, THAT THE

22
00:00:46,750 --> 00:00:48,960
SCHOOLS WILL GET BETTER IS NOT
WORKING IN MICHIGAN

23
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:53,870
WHERE YOU HAD A HUGE IMPACT
AND INFLUENCE OVER THE

24
00:00:53,870 --> 00:00:55,210
DIRECTION OF THE SCHOOL SYSTEM
HERE.

25
00:00:55,210 --> 00:01:00,500
I HESITATE TO TALK ABOUT ALL
SCHOOLS IN GENERAL BECAUSE

26
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:02,480
SCHOOLS ARE MADE UP OF
INDIVIDUAL STUDENTS

27
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:03,480
ATTENDING THEM.

28
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:08,320
THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS HERE ARE
DOING WORSE THAN THEY DID.

29
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:10,040
MICHIGAN SCHOOLS NEED TO DO
BETTER.

30
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:12,400
THERE IS NO DOUBT ABOUT IT.

31
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:14,940
SHE KNOWS THAT SHE HAS TO
KEEP SMIZING THE WHOLE TIME.

32
00:01:14,940 --> 00:01:16,330
THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT I WAS
GOING TO SAY.

33
00:01:16,330 --> 00:01:20,740
SHE HAS AN INCREDIBLE ABILITY TO
SMILE THROUGH ANGER.

34
00:01:20,740 --> 00:01:22,900
LIKE I HAVE NEVER SEEN BEFORE.

35
00:01:22,900 --> 00:01:27,070
I RANK HER NUMBER ONE IN THE
COUNTRY OF SMILING

36
00:01:27,070 --> 00:01:30,610
PLEASANTLY WHILE BEING
INTERNALLY FURIOUS.

37
00:01:30,610 --> 00:01:33,310
YOU ARE OWNING ME RIGHT NOW, I
LOOK LIKE AN IDIOT.

38
00:01:33,310 --> 00:01:37,970
COME AGAIN, I DO NOT
KNOW WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT.

39
00:01:37,970 --> 00:01:40,290
THAT'S IT, IT IS THE NOT
KNOWING WHAT SHE'S TALKING ABOUT

40
00:01:40,290 --> 00:01:43,200
AND SO SHE TRIED TO DEFEND
HERSELF ON TWITTER AND THAT

41
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:46,490
ASPECT OF NOT KNOWING WHAT SHE
IS TALKING ABOUT COMES THROUGH.

42
00:01:46,490 --> 00:01:49,810
HERE'S A TWEET SHE HAD TO DEFEND
HER PERFORMANCE.

43
00:01:49,810 --> 00:01:57,560
SHE WRITES:

44
00:01:57,560 --> 00:02:10,780
SEE ATTACHED TWO CHARTS.

45
00:02:10,780 --> 00:02:16,410
THEY SHOW, THE GRAY LINE, FOR
THOSE AT HOME WHO ARE JUST

46
00:02:16,410 --> 00:02:19,360
LISTENING, THEY HAVE A LINE THAT
REPRESENTS THE NATIONAL PUBLIC

47
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:22,920
AVERAGE AND THEN THE MICHIGAN
LINE AND KIND OF WHEN BETSY AND

48
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:26,030
HER FRIENDS GET IN CHARGE OF THE
MICHIGAN EDUCATION SYSTEM, YOU

49
00:02:26,030 --> 00:02:31,260
SEE THAT MICHIGAN'S NUMBERS FALL
BELOW THE NATIONAL AVERAGE IN

50
00:02:31,260 --> 00:02:35,260
BOTH MATHEMATICS AND READING AND
WHAT BETSY DRAWS FROM THIS IS

51
00:02:35,260 --> 00:02:38,170
THE CONCLUSION THAT EVERYONE
NEEDS TO DO BETTER, SO WE NEED

52
00:02:38,170 --> 00:02:40,940
MORE OF HER POLICIES, EVEN
THOUGH YOU KIND OF HAVE A

53
00:02:40,940 --> 00:02:41,940
GRAPHIC

54
00:02:41,940 --> 00:02:45,040
REPRESENTATION THAT HER SCHOOL
CHOICE POLICY IS FAILING

55
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:48,210
HER STATE COMPARED TO THE REST
OF THE COUNTRY.

56
00:02:48,210 --> 00:02:52,160
I BELIEVE THAT'S WHAT THE
KIDS AT HOME CALL A SELF OWN.

57
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:59,320
OH YEAH, 60 MINUTES DIDN'T SHOW
YOU HOW STUPID I REALLY AM SO

58
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:02,110
LET ME TAKE THIS OPPORTUNITY TO
SHOW YOU WHAT A MISERABLE

59
00:03:02,110 --> 00:03:04,180
FAILURE MY IDEAS HAVE BEEN IN
MICHIGAN.

60
00:03:04,180 --> 00:03:06,150
HAVE YOUR OPINIONS OF HER
CHANGED AFTER SEEING THIS

61
00:03:06,150 --> 00:03:08,760
RESPONSE AND THE 60 MINUTES
THING?

62
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:11,610
HAS YOUR OPINION CHANGED OF HER?

63
00:03:11,610 --> 00:03:14,210
WHEN WE FIRST SAW THE 60
MINUTES THING, ANA AND I TALKED

64
00:03:14,210 --> 00:03:17,440
ABOUT IT EARLIER IN THE WEEK,
WHAT CAME ACROSS TO ME WAS

65
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:18,520
AFFLUENZA.

66
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:22,570
THAT SHE IS SO WEALTHY THAT NO
ONE HAS EVER ASKED HER TO

67
00:03:22,570 --> 00:03:23,860
DEFEND HER OPINIONS BEFORE.

68
00:03:23,860 --> 00:03:27,379
SHE SURROUNDED BY PEOPLE GOING,
BETSY, YOU ARE SO RIGHT AND

69
00:03:27,379 --> 00:03:29,239
WHAT A PLEASANT SMILE.

70
00:03:29,239 --> 00:03:30,599
OF COURSE.

71
00:03:30,599 --> 00:03:32,849
SHE NEVER HAD TO DO HER
HOMEWORK.

72
00:03:32,849 --> 00:03:36,500
SUCCESS WAS NOT TIED TO MERIT IN
BETSY DEVOS'S WORLD OR IN

73
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:37,739
DONALD TRUMP'S WORLD.

74
00:03:37,739 --> 00:03:40,440
NO MATTER HOW MANY TIMES DONALD
TRUMP WENT BANKRUPT HIS DAD

75
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:41,440
WOULD BAIL HIM OUT.

76
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:44,660
NO MATTER HOW MANY CLASSES HE
FAILED, HIS DAD WOULD BAIL

77
00:03:44,660 --> 00:03:47,190
HIM OUT, SO HE LEARNED, YOU DO
NOT HAVE TO DO HOMEWORK.

78
00:03:47,190 --> 00:03:51,230
SO AS PRESIDENT HE DOESN'T DO
IT, AND BETSY DEVOS DOES NOT DO

79
00:03:51,230 --> 00:03:52,230
IT.

80
00:03:52,230 --> 00:03:55,960
IN THE CASE OF CHARTER SCHOOLS,
THERE IS ALSO VERY MIXED AND

81
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:59,550
THERE IS NO CONVINCING EVIDENCE
THAT THEY DO BETTER THAN PUBLIC

82
00:03:59,550 --> 00:04:02,860
SCHOOLS AND ON THE ISSUE THAT
SHE VOLUNTARILY BROUGHT UP ABOUT

83
00:04:02,860 --> 00:04:06,060
HOW THEY PULLED PUBLIC SCHOOLS
UP, WHEN YOU TAKE MONEY AWAY

84
00:04:06,060 --> 00:04:09,489
FROM PUBLIC SCHOOLS FOR THE
CHARTER SCHOOLS, SHE IS FLAT

85
00:04:09,489 --> 00:04:10,489
WRONG

86
00:04:10,489 --> 00:04:11,489
THERE.

87
00:04:11,489 --> 00:04:13,080
NO, IT HURTS PUBLIC SCHOOLS WHEN
YOU TAKE MONEY AWAY FROM

88
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:15,800
THEM AND OF COURSE.

89
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:18,870
BUT AT LEAST MAKE YOUR CASE,
BETSY.

90
00:04:18,870 --> 00:04:21,259
WHAT YOU COULD HAVE DONE IF YOU
WANTED TO BE SUFFICIENTLY

91
00:04:21,259 --> 00:04:25,000
MISLEADING IS TAKE ONE STATE
THAT ACTUALLY DOES WELL WITH

92
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:30,080
CHARTER SCHOOLS BECAUSE THEY
EXIST AND IN THAT CASE, ARIZONA.

93
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:33,180
FLORIDA DOES WORSE, MICHIGAN,
THERE ARE A LOT OF STATES

94
00:04:33,180 --> 00:04:35,330
THAT DO WORSE AND CHARTER
SCHOOLS DO WORSE THAN

95
00:04:35,330 --> 00:04:38,729
PUBLIC SCHOOLS IN SOME INSTANCES
OR A LOT OF THEM, BUT IN

96
00:04:38,729 --> 00:04:41,521
ARIZONA THE CHARTER SCHOOLS DO
PRETTY WELL, SO YOU COULD OF

97
00:04:41,521 --> 00:04:42,521
JUST

98
00:04:42,521 --> 00:04:44,100
SAID, BUT LESLIE, WHAT ABOUT
ARIZONA?

99
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:50,270
LET ME READ YOU THE STATS OR
AFTER THE INTERVIEW, DO YOUR

100
00:04:50,270 --> 00:04:51,270
HOMEWORK.

101
00:04:51,270 --> 00:04:54,849
YOU ARE THE SECRETARY OF THE
WHOLE DEPARTMENT.

102
00:04:54,849 --> 00:04:57,189
THERE ARE THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE
WORKING UNDER YOU.

103
00:04:57,189 --> 00:05:00,949
HAVE ONE OF THEM TO THE HOMEWORK
AND THEN SEND OUT THE TWEET.

104
00:05:00,949 --> 00:05:03,629
FOR ME THIS BEHAVIOR JUST
UNDERSCORES THE FACT THAT SHE

105
00:05:03,629 --> 00:05:07,969
IS A LOBBYIST AT HEART BECAUSE A
LOBBYIST DOES NOT EVER QUESTION

106
00:05:07,969 --> 00:05:12,419
THE GOAL, AND THE GOAL FOR HER
IS TO EXPAND CHARTER SCHOOLS.

107
00:05:12,419 --> 00:05:16,030
HER GOAL ISN'T NECESSARILY TO DO
THE BEST FOR THE DEPARTMENT

108
00:05:16,030 --> 00:05:19,830
OF EDUCATION, TO DO THE BEST
FOR SCHOOLS AT LARGE AND

109
00:05:19,830 --> 00:05:21,509
CONSIDER OTHER OPTIONS.

110
00:05:21,509 --> 00:05:24,629
HER DECISION HAS BEEN MADE A
LONG TIME AGO BECAUSE OF

111
00:05:24,629 --> 00:05:25,860
THE PEOPLE SHE HANGS AROUND.

112
00:05:25,860 --> 00:05:29,090
THAT IS PART OF AFFLUENZA AND
SHE JUST DECIDES THAT MY

113
00:05:29,090 --> 00:05:33,099
JOB IS TO MAKE SURE THAT I GET
THIS MONEY FROM PUBLIC

114
00:05:33,099 --> 00:05:36,819
SCHOOL SYSTEM TO THE PEOPLE I
KNOW WHO ARE ASKING FOR IT

115
00:05:36,819 --> 00:05:37,819
AND THAT IS WHAT IT IS.

116
00:05:37,819 --> 00:05:42,059
SHE'S BEEN, THERE WAS ONE
AMAZING OP ED THAT SAID SHE

117
00:05:42,059 --> 00:05:46,139
SPENT, THE DEVOS FAMILY
CONTRIBUTED $1.45 MILLION

118
00:05:46,139 --> 00:05:49,470
IN 2016, OVER THE COURSE OF TWO
MONTHS, WHICH MEANS

119
00:05:49,470 --> 00:05:55,249
THEY WERE GIVING $24,000 A DAY
TO TRY TO GET MORE MONEY AWAY

120
00:05:55,249 --> 00:05:56,249
FROM

121
00:05:56,249 --> 00:05:58,770
THE PUBLIC SCHOOL SYSTEM AND,
THEY BECOME PUBLIC SCHOOLS

122
00:05:58,770 --> 00:06:00,849
BECAUSE THEY ARE PUBLICLY FUNDED
BUT WHAT YOU WOULD CONSIDER

123
00:06:00,849 --> 00:06:03,919
TO BE A PRIVATE, RELIGIOUS
INSTITUTION AND THE TROUBLE

124
00:06:03,919 --> 00:06:06,969
WITH THAT IS SHE DOESN'T EVEN
OPEN IT UP FOR THE POSSIBILITY

125
00:06:06,969 --> 00:06:10,370
THAT YOU CAN EVALUATE THE
SCHOOLS PROPERLY, BECAUSE ONCE

126
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:12,729
YOU GET OUT OF THE PUBLIC SCHOOL
SYSTEM, WHICH YOU CAN AT LEAST

127
00:06:12,729 --> 00:06:16,719
MONITOR AND TEST AND SEE CLEARLY
INTO, ONCE YOU GET INTO THE

128
00:06:16,719 --> 00:06:19,610
PRIVATE INSTITUTIONS, THEY HAVE
MADE IT MORE AND MORE DIFFICULT

129
00:06:19,610 --> 00:06:22,419
TO SEE HOW THEY ARE DOING AND
HOW THE MONEY IS SPENT.

130
00:06:22,419 --> 00:06:24,919
AND BY THE WAY, THAT IS A
SECOND PROBLEM.

131
00:06:24,919 --> 00:06:28,069
SHE'S A RELIGIOUS FUNDAMENTALIST
SO SHE THINKS, EVIDENCE?

132
00:06:28,069 --> 00:06:30,509
I DON'T NEED THE EVIDENCE.

133
00:06:30,509 --> 00:06:34,529
WHATEVER I WAS TOLD BY MY LEADER
IS CORRECT, PERIOD.

134
00:06:34,529 --> 00:06:35,889
END OF THE QUESTION.

135
00:06:35,889 --> 00:06:39,110
DO NOT BOTHER ME WITH YOUR FACTS
AND LOGIC.

136
00:06:39,110 --> 00:06:42,740
IN FACT, LOOK AT THIS ONE
COMMENT SHE MADE IN THE

137
00:06:42,740 --> 00:06:44,469
VIDEO YOU MUST EARLIER.

138
00:06:44,469 --> 00:06:47,419
"I HESITATE TO TALK ABOUT ALL
SCHOOLS IN GENERAL BECAUSE

139
00:06:47,419 --> 00:06:50,189
SCHOOLS ARE MADE UP OF
INDIVIDUAL STUDENTS

140
00:06:50,189 --> 00:06:51,909
ATTENDING THEM."

141
00:06:51,909 --> 00:06:55,279
BY THAT LOGIC YOU CAN NEVER
EVALUATE WHETHER OR NOT CHARTER

142
00:06:55,279 --> 00:06:58,830
SCHOOLS OR PRIVATE SCHOOLS DO
WELL BECAUSE THEY'RE MADE UP OF

143
00:06:58,830 --> 00:07:02,770
THE INDIVIDUAL STUDENS THAT
ATTEND THEM.

144
00:07:02,770 --> 00:07:05,610
HOW ARE YOU GOING TO BE
EDUCATION SECRETARY IF YOU

145
00:07:05,610 --> 00:07:11,860
CANNOT JUDGE THE PERFORMANCES OF
ANY OF 

146
00:07:11,860 --> 00:00:00,000
THE SCHOOLS?
