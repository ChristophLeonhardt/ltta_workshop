00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,100
years and<font color="#E5E5E5"> seven months</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I have been</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on</font>

00:00:05,100 --> 00:00:08,970
this planet<font color="#E5E5E5"> I have been single for 25</font>

4
00:00:08,970 --> 00:00:13,230
years and five months of them yeah quite

5
00:00:13,230 --> 00:00:15,870
a lot am I<font color="#E5E5E5"> just a loser am ia too</font>

6
00:00:15,870 --> 00:00:18,600
repulsive<font color="#CCCCCC"> to girls maybe I'm too picky</font>

7
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:21,320
or perhaps I'm just destined to be alone

8
00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:23,880
well upon reflection<font color="#E5E5E5"> I can think of some</font>

9
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:26,130
reasons<font color="#CCCCCC"> why that is I am quite</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> an</font>

10
00:00:26,130 --> 00:00:27,900
intense person if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you didn't know</font>

11
00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:29,640
already from either meeting me or seeing

12
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:31,830
me on these videos and secondly i am

13
00:00:31,830 --> 00:00:34,170
quite selective with the people i'd like

14
00:00:34,170 --> 00:00:36,030
to date but<font color="#CCCCCC"> i think that's a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> good</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> thing</font>

15
00:00:36,030 --> 00:00:38,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">you need to make sure you know what</font>

16
00:00:38,010 --> 00:00:39,600
you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> looking for in a partner I've</font>

17
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:41,489
seen<font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> many people who go into a</font>

18
00:00:41,489 --> 00:00:43,739
relationship it doesn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> work they come</font>

19
00:00:43,739 --> 00:00:45,570
out they go into another and it just

20
00:00:45,570 --> 00:00:47,550
becomes like a process<font color="#E5E5E5"> of trial and</font>

21
00:00:47,550 --> 00:00:49,140
error they'll just keep going into

22
00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:51,180
relationships until one happens to work

23
00:00:51,180 --> 00:00:53,670
out and I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> think that's healthy if</font>

24
00:00:53,670 --> 00:00:56,670
you are unhappy don't use a relationship

25
00:00:56,670 --> 00:00:58,350
as something that is<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to fix that</font>

26
00:00:58,350 --> 00:01:00,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's something that will only add to</font>

27
00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:04,140
what you currently got you need to find

28
00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:07,110
ways to stand on your own two feet and

29
00:01:07,110 --> 00:01:10,320
once you are confident<font color="#E5E5E5"> in yourself as a</font>

30
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:12,420
person then I believe you can go and

31
00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:15,119
have a successful relationship so for a

32
00:01:15,119 --> 00:01:17,430
bit of fun I thought<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'd list five</font>

33
00:01:17,430 --> 00:01:20,759
things I look for in a girl but before<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

34
00:01:20,759 --> 00:01:22,680
do there are three little things I

35
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:24,270
should<font color="#CCCCCC"> get out the way physical</font>

36
00:01:24,270 --> 00:01:26,520
attraction which is a<font color="#CCCCCC"> no-brainer you</font>

37
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:28,020
need to be physically attracted to

38
00:01:28,020 --> 00:01:30,240
someone you know you<font color="#E5E5E5"> asked me am I into</font>

39
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:33,150
blondes or brunettes it's a non question

40
00:01:33,150 --> 00:01:36,180
for me because I take everyone on an

41
00:01:36,180 --> 00:01:38,280
individual basis you know when I meet

42
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:40,860
someone if the chemicals are there in

43
00:01:40,860 --> 00:01:43,680
that moment I will<font color="#E5E5E5"> know so I just</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> don't</font>

44
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:46,290
like to generalize people on physical

45
00:01:46,290 --> 00:01:48,090
traits I don't think<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's constructive</font>

46
00:01:48,090 --> 00:01:50,670
they have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be single do I need</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

47
00:01:50,670 --> 00:01:52,619
explain that and thirdly they have to

48
00:01:52,619 --> 00:01:54,060
like me if you're going into<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

49
00:01:54,060 --> 00:01:55,829
relationship with<font color="#CCCCCC"> Saudi</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> doesn't like you</font>

50
00:01:55,829 --> 00:01:57,630
you're gonna have a problem so with<font color="#E5E5E5"> all</font>

51
00:01:57,630 --> 00:01:59,759
that in mind here are my five things I

52
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:02,070
look for in a girl okay number one a

53
00:02:02,070 --> 00:02:05,219
good balance of maturity and fun now has

54
00:02:05,219 --> 00:02:06,630
already explained i'm quite an intense

55
00:02:06,630 --> 00:02:08,550
person so I think it's only<font color="#E5E5E5"> fair that</font>

56
00:02:08,550 --> 00:02:11,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">the person i'm with also has a serious</font>

57
00:02:11,670 --> 00:02:13,890
side they're willing to<font color="#E5E5E5"> have the</font>

58
00:02:13,890 --> 00:02:15,750
and meaningful conversations and in

59
00:02:15,750 --> 00:02:16,980
other times they're willing<font color="#CCCCCC"> to just let</font>

60
00:02:16,980 --> 00:02:20,459
go<font color="#E5E5E5"> and enjoy life and not worry about</font>

61
00:02:20,459 --> 00:02:22,410
all the<font color="#CCCCCC"> bad stuff</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that goes on number</font>

62
00:02:22,410 --> 00:02:24,750
two has a lot of drive and<font color="#E5E5E5"> passion I'm</font>

63
00:02:24,750 --> 00:02:26,550
someone who lives life to the full I

64
00:02:26,550 --> 00:02:29,190
never once a second to go wasted so I

65
00:02:29,190 --> 00:02:30,480
get<font color="#E5E5E5"> involved in lots of projects</font>

66
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:32,910
wherever it's doing UK tours my youtube

67
00:02:32,910 --> 00:02:37,290
videos stick aid activism the universal

68
00:02:37,290 --> 00:02:39,959
solutions project my band you name it so

69
00:02:39,959 --> 00:02:42,930
I'd<font color="#CCCCCC"> like to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> find son who also has a lot</font>

70
00:02:42,930 --> 00:02:44,640
of passion in lots of different projects

71
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:47,040
number three independent you often<font color="#E5E5E5"> hear</font>

72
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:49,170
<font color="#CCCCCC">people say they don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like someone who</font>

73
00:02:49,170 --> 00:02:52,080
is clingy or too clingy I mean cuddles

74
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:55,170
are great and it's good<font color="#CCCCCC"> to spend</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> time</font>

75
00:02:55,170 --> 00:02:57,450
together with your loved one but at<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

76
00:02:57,450 --> 00:03:01,580
same time it shouldn't be a 24-7

77
00:03:01,580 --> 00:03:05,280
surveillance exercise I think you should

78
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:06,930
have complete trust to go out and do

79
00:03:06,930 --> 00:03:08,640
your<font color="#E5E5E5"> own</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> thing which relates to number</font>

80
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:10,950
to have your own projects some of which

81
00:03:10,950 --> 00:03:13,950
<font color="#CCCCCC">may cross over and complement each other</font>

82
00:03:13,950 --> 00:03:15,510
but I think being<font color="#CCCCCC"> able to go out</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and do</font>

83
00:03:15,510 --> 00:03:18,480
your<font color="#E5E5E5"> own thing and then come back at</font>

84
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:20,190
times in the evenings<font color="#E5E5E5"> and that and then</font>

85
00:03:20,190 --> 00:03:22,140
spend quality time together I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think</font>

86
00:03:22,140 --> 00:03:24,239
that's a healthy balance to have number

87
00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:26,940
four American this is a shallow one I

88
00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:30,810
understand partly<font color="#E5E5E5"> because of the accent</font>

89
00:03:30,810 --> 00:03:32,400
the American accent regardless of what

90
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:35,850
area<font color="#CCCCCC"> I find incredibly attractive but</font>

91
00:03:35,850 --> 00:03:37,709
it's also because as I've said before

92
00:03:37,709 --> 00:03:41,220
while wants to move to America generally

93
00:03:41,220 --> 00:03:45,030
not everyone in America is a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> more</font>

94
00:03:45,030 --> 00:03:48,480
outgoing a lot more sociable and a lot

95
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:50,459
more<font color="#CCCCCC"> positive and I just like that</font>

96
00:03:50,459 --> 00:03:51,989
energy that's not to say i'm going to

97
00:03:51,989 --> 00:03:54,260
write off anyone who's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> american but</font>

98
00:03:54,260 --> 00:03:57,530
we have preferences and number<font color="#E5E5E5"> five</font>

99
00:03:57,530 --> 00:04:00,420
quirky I just like people<font color="#E5E5E5"> that have</font>

100
00:04:00,420 --> 00:04:02,730
quirky traits whether it's the way they

101
00:04:02,730 --> 00:04:05,670
dress or the mannerisms they have it

102
00:04:05,670 --> 00:04:07,110
doesn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> have to be anything significant</font>

103
00:04:07,110 --> 00:04:09,120
just little quirky things that make them

104
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:12,269
different um I just find it cute and I

105
00:04:12,269 --> 00:04:15,660
really like that<font color="#CCCCCC"> so yeah those are my</font>

106
00:04:15,660 --> 00:04:18,238
thigh things I look for in a girl and I

107
00:04:18,238 --> 00:04:19,680
understand this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> probably starting</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

108
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:22,229
look like a dating video and I guess I'm

109
00:04:22,229 --> 00:04:23,610
interested<font color="#E5E5E5"> to hear what five things you</font>

110
00:04:23,610 --> 00:04:25,800
look for in a partner perhaps you've

111
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:26,970
found some already

112
00:04:26,970 --> 00:04:29,700
tell me how that's going and how it

113
00:04:29,700 --> 00:04:31,650
compares to your original perceptions

114
00:04:31,650 --> 00:04:34,410
because sometimes we have an idea<font color="#E5E5E5"> but</font>

115
00:04:34,410 --> 00:04:36,300
it's only when<font color="#E5E5E5"> you find that special</font>

116
00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:38,790
person that you truly understand what

117
00:04:38,790 --> 00:04:41,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">you've always wanted so yeah look</font>

118

119
00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:46,620
