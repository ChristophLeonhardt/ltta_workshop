00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,129
hey everyone hope all is well I wanted

00:00:02,129 --> 00:00:04,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> discuss journalism today I mean when</font>

3
00:00:04,470 --> 00:00:06,410
you think of a journalist or<font color="#E5E5E5"> a good</font>

4
00:00:06,410 --> 00:00:09,179
journalist what would you expect of them

5
00:00:09,179 --> 00:00:12,059
just someone who reports the facts or

6
00:00:12,059 --> 00:00:15,690
maybe puts an opinion<font color="#E5E5E5"> to then generate</font>

7
00:00:15,690 --> 00:00:17,900
more opinions so a discussion can occur

8
00:00:17,900 --> 00:00:20,340
well something I've become increasingly

9
00:00:20,340 --> 00:00:22,230
aware of over the past few years is

10
00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:24,840
citizen journalism and in particular

11
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:27,269
there's one organization we<font color="#CCCCCC"> are change</font>

12
00:00:27,269 --> 00:00:30,000
which you can view on youtube links in

13
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,668
the description<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the founder of that</font>

14
00:00:32,668 --> 00:00:35,460
organization Luke radowski forgive me if

15
00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:37,260
I didn't pronounce that right I saw him

16
00:00:37,260 --> 00:00:39,180
recently talked about citizen journalism

17
00:00:39,180 --> 00:00:43,370
on<font color="#E5E5E5"> Russia today and he defined it as</font>

18
00:00:43,370 --> 00:00:46,680
when an individual goes out there to ask

19
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:49,860
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> right questions and effectively is a</font>

20
00:00:49,860 --> 00:00:51,570
journalist who does<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have the</font>

21
00:00:51,570 --> 00:00:54,149
pressures of mainstream media or

22
00:00:54,149 --> 00:00:56,489
therefore corporations that would say we

23
00:00:56,489 --> 00:00:58,230
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have this particular agenda and</font>

24
00:00:58,230 --> 00:01:00,149
<font color="#CCCCCC">we don't want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to cover this but we want</font>

25
00:01:00,149 --> 00:01:02,340
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> cover that and I found it interesting</font>

26
00:01:02,340 --> 00:01:05,939
and watching a lot of his<font color="#CCCCCC"> stuff the guy</font>

27
00:01:05,939 --> 00:01:08,490
definitely has guts and I have huge

28
00:01:08,490 --> 00:01:11,100
respect for what he does and many<font color="#E5E5E5"> people</font>

29
00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:13,920
were like um and he's been following a

30
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:17,009
lot recently the Bilderberg meetings the

31
00:01:17,009 --> 00:01:19,229
secret meetings that happen<font color="#E5E5E5"> every year</font>

32
00:01:19,229 --> 00:01:22,979
in which over<font color="#CCCCCC"> 100 of the world's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> most</font>

33
00:01:22,979 --> 00:01:25,110
powerful people get together secretly of

34
00:01:25,110 --> 00:01:28,020
the books to discuss policies and of

35
00:01:28,020 --> 00:01:30,810
course as you know what I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> whenever</font>

36
00:01:30,810 --> 00:01:33,960
there are things done in secrecy it will

37
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:36,270
only lead<font color="#E5E5E5"> to questions being asked which</font>

38
00:01:36,270 --> 00:01:39,540
can lead to speculation and that's just

39
00:01:39,540 --> 00:01:41,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">opinions with no real backing or</font>

40
00:01:41,610 --> 00:01:45,840
evidence and conspiracies and all you

41
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:47,280
know conspiracies aren't always bad

42
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:49,590
there are people that<font color="#E5E5E5"> make pretty decent</font>

43
00:01:49,590 --> 00:01:52,020
rational conspiracy theories and then of

44
00:01:52,020 --> 00:01:54,119
course<font color="#E5E5E5"> you get people that are a bit</font>

45

asking direct questions to them he

55
00:02:19,530 --> 00:02:22,260
actually catches them off God and by

56
00:02:22,260 --> 00:02:24,560
catching him off guard they respond and

57
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:28,170
actually give answers that you know

58
00:02:28,170 --> 00:02:32,580
expose potential truth and with<font color="#CCCCCC"> Tony</font>

59
00:02:32,580 --> 00:02:34,860
<font color="#CCCCCC">Blair's clip I was very impressed</font>

60
00:02:34,860 --> 00:02:36,480
although there was a segment in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

61
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:39,090
middle was wearing you enjoy pulling all

62
00:02:39,090 --> 00:02:41,400
these people enjoy flowing all these

63
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:43,980
people with your<font color="#E5E5E5"> new world order we know</font>

00:02:43,980 --> 00:02:46,230
your abomination of evil I know you care

65
00:02:46,230 --> 00:02:47,940
nothing about these people<font color="#CCCCCC"> you master</font>

66
00:02:47,940 --> 00:02:50,220
and I think that segment of the video

67
00:02:50,220 --> 00:02:51,890
especially when I was<font color="#E5E5E5"> showing it to</font>

68
00:02:51,890 --> 00:02:55,080
friends of mine that part put them off

69
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:57,750
as<font color="#E5E5E5"> soon as I saw that they felt the need</font>

70
00:02:57,750 --> 00:02:59,400
to disregard the rest of the video in

71
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:00,960
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> last couple of weeks and anyone</font>

72
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:03,350
who's been following the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Republican</font>

73
00:03:03,350 --> 00:03:05,700
nomination process to see who's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">take on Barack Obama the following of</font>

rompl for the Republican nomination has

76

been fascinating<font color="#CCCCCC"> and he has a son Rand</font>

Paul who came out and endorsed Mitt

78
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:23,250
Romney as the nominee and Luke decided

79
00:03:23,250 --> 00:03:25,770
to go and find rampu and find out why he

80
00:03:25,770 --> 00:03:28,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">had done this so when Rand Paul was</font>

81
00:03:28,140 --> 00:03:30,959
walking between two meetings again I'll

82
00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:32,850
put the link<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> description he was</font>

83
00:03:32,850 --> 00:03:34,530
following up the street asking the same

84
00:03:34,530 --> 00:03:37,260
question again and again and he didn't

85
00:03:37,260 --> 00:03:39,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">get a response Rampaul shrugged it off</font>

86
00:03:39,540 --> 00:03:41,640
and said well I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> between meetings</font>

87
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:43,980
and we can book an appointment which of

88
00:03:43,980 --> 00:03:45,570
course makes a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> people feel well</font>

89
00:03:45,570 --> 00:03:47,550
he's not gonna have an appointment

90
00:03:47,550 --> 00:03:48,630
because he doesn't want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to answer those</font>

91
00:03:48,630 --> 00:03:52,530
questions and it was<font color="#CCCCCC"> interesting because</font>

92
00:03:52,530 --> 00:03:55,560
at that point<font color="#E5E5E5"> and especially in the</font>

93
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:57,570
second half<font color="#E5E5E5"> of that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> video when Luke</font>

00:04:23,470 --> 00:04:26,440
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> ask you one quick question um you</font>

105
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:27,880
know your endorsement for<font color="#E5E5E5"> Mitt Romney</font>

106
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:29,650
people have a<font color="#CCCCCC"> lot of questions about it</font>

107
00:04:29,650 --> 00:04:31,960
I just wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to see your opinion on it</font>

108
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:35,050
<font color="#CCCCCC">uh what do you think about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> all of ron</font>

109
00:04:35,050 --> 00:04:37,330
paul's followers and just your father's

110
00:04:37,330 --> 00:04:39,280
movement catering<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the establishment</font>

111
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:43,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's shut you guys out for so long and</font>

112
00:04:43,150 --> 00:04:45,130
in<font color="#CCCCCC"> that instance it reminded me of how</font>

113
00:04:45,130 --> 00:04:47,950
<font color="#CCCCCC">the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> paparazzi are with celebrities you</font>

114
00:04:47,950 --> 00:04:50,710
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> they interrupt their daily routine</font>

115
00:04:50,710 --> 00:04:53,470
to try and get<font color="#E5E5E5"> the inside scoop to me it</font>

116
00:04:53,470 --> 00:04:56,260
seems like a form of ambush journalism

117
00:04:56,260 --> 00:04:58,330
because<font color="#CCCCCC"> i think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> really does sum up</font>

118
00:04:58,330 --> 00:04:59,770
what it is it's about catching them off

119
00:04:59,770 --> 00:05:04,389
<font color="#E5E5E5">god and so the question becomes is it a</font>

120
00:05:04,389 --> 00:05:07,600
good thing or a bad thing and by<font color="#CCCCCC"> that i</font>

121
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:09,700
mean is it actually a constructive

122
00:05:09,700 --> 00:05:12,550
process that is going to help society or

123
00:05:12,550 --> 00:05:14,620
is it actually going to backfire and

124
00:05:14,620 --> 00:05:16,630
cause more problems in the future i was

125
00:05:16,630 --> 00:05:19,120
discussing it on my weekly show 376 live

126
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:22,750
on<font color="#E5E5E5"> sunday and didn't really come to any</font>

127
00:05:22,750 --> 00:05:24,580
conclusions and I actually spoke about

128
00:05:24,580 --> 00:05:28,110
it with abby martin who did approach

129
00:05:28,110 --> 00:05:30,490
rampu and it was interesting<font color="#E5E5E5"> to hear</font>

130
00:05:30,490 --> 00:05:34,810
what she had to say as well but I think

131
00:05:34,810 --> 00:05:37,270
the good reasons for it actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> come</font>

132
00:05:37,270 --> 00:05:39,430
down<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the intention</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the intentions are</font>

133
00:05:39,430 --> 00:05:42,430
good it's to help<font color="#CCCCCC"> society I think there</font>

134
00:05:42,430 --> 00:05:46,600
are<font color="#CCCCCC"> two intentions behind it the first</font>

135
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:50,260
one is intimidation it's to remind the

136
00:05:50,260 --> 00:05:52,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">ruling class that the people know what's</font>

137
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:54,639
going on yes the mainstream media may

138
00:05:54,639 --> 00:05:56,860
not report certain issues but we want

139
00:05:56,860 --> 00:05:58,870
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> to know that when going to hold you</font>

140
00:05:58,870 --> 00:06:01,260
accountable that we are going to

141
00:06:01,260 --> 00:06:04,960
challenge you on your words and your

142
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:08,289
actions so that is a good thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> and the</font>

143
00:06:08,289 --> 00:06:11,200
second intention is of course what

144
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:13,630
journalism is all about<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's to obtain</font>

145
00:06:13,630 --> 00:06:15,789
the truth because by confronting them

146
00:06:15,789 --> 00:06:19,450
you are going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to obtain if not the truth</font>

147
00:06:19,450 --> 00:06:22,419
<font color="#E5E5E5">but essences of the truth you know</font>

148
00:06:22,419 --> 00:06:24,520
you'll<font color="#CCCCCC"> think I'll they acted in that way</font>

149
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:25,720
that shows that<font color="#E5E5E5"> they haven't been</font>

150
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:27,460
truthful before because you can tell

151
00:06:27,460 --> 00:06:30,370
<font color="#CCCCCC">from body language etc so if those are</font>

152
00:06:30,370 --> 00:06:31,900
the good intentions and if I've got it

153
00:06:31,900 --> 00:06:34,960
wrong please do correct me the bad

154
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:37,419
aspects of it<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think are actually the</font>

155
00:06:37,419 --> 00:06:39,220
repercussions of doing this form of

156
00:06:39,220 --> 00:06:43,000
journalism so it's actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> same two</font>

157
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,280
points so the<font color="#CCCCCC"> bad reasons for doing it</font>

158
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:49,120
is one intimidation by intimidating and

159
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:50,590
yes you're reminding them that the

160
00:06:50,590 --> 00:06:52,139
<font color="#CCCCCC">people know what they're up to and</font>

161
00:06:52,139 --> 00:06:54,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">therefore it will actually push them</font>

162
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:57,940
into taking actions so they don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

163
00:06:57,940 --> 00:07:00,400
<font color="#CCCCCC">to face that sort of journalism again</font>

164
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:03,909
they<font color="#E5E5E5"> will do more backroom meetings or</font>

165
00:07:03,909 --> 00:07:05,740
that they will<font color="#E5E5E5"> move from place to place</font>

166
00:07:05,740 --> 00:07:09,729
more secretly with more security say

167
00:07:09,729 --> 00:07:13,630
that they<font color="#CCCCCC"> are less approachable and the</font>

168
00:07:13,630 --> 00:07:16,620
second reason was to obtain information

169
00:07:16,620 --> 00:07:20,530
that obtained the truth well if you are

170
00:07:20,530 --> 00:07:22,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to catch them off guard they don't</font>

171
00:07:22,180 --> 00:07:24,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">have to say anything and actually</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> having</font>

172
00:07:24,550 --> 00:07:26,789
done psychology myself in criminology

173
00:07:26,789 --> 00:07:28,659
although this may not<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> directly</font>

174
00:07:28,659 --> 00:07:31,569
related and if you are accused of doing

175
00:07:31,569 --> 00:07:33,969
a crime which let's say<font color="#E5E5E5"> you were</font>

176
00:07:33,969 --> 00:07:38,680
innocent of it has been proven that you

177
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:40,539
are<font color="#E5E5E5"> better off saying nothing than</font>

178
00:07:40,539 --> 00:07:44,400
denying it even if you had you know

179
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:47,949
every reason to deny it it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually</font>

180
00:07:47,949 --> 00:07:50,409
better in public opinion to say nothing

181
00:07:50,409 --> 00:07:53,349
so in that sort of way you can kind of

182
00:07:53,349 --> 00:07:56,860
sympathize with why politicians<font color="#E5E5E5"> who are</font>

183
00:07:56,860 --> 00:07:58,509
<font color="#E5E5E5">being challenged in that sense may not</font>

184
00:07:58,509 --> 00:08:00,219
want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> say anything I guess what I'm</font>

185
00:08:00,219 --> 00:08:03,130
trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to say is I believe that citizen</font>

186
00:08:03,130 --> 00:08:05,289
journalism definitely needs to<font color="#E5E5E5"> happen we</font>

187
00:08:05,289 --> 00:08:07,449
need to keep hounding down the ruling

188
00:08:07,449 --> 00:08:09,729
class and letting<font color="#CCCCCC"> him know that the</font>

189
00:08:09,729 --> 00:08:12,340
people do care and do<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to hold them</font>

190
00:08:12,340 --> 00:08:14,380
accountable but<font color="#CCCCCC"> I feel that if we don't</font>

191
00:08:14,380 --> 00:08:16,900
have another plan running parallel with

192
00:08:16,900 --> 00:08:19,360
this you're actually going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be driving</font>

193
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:23,680
these elite people<font color="#E5E5E5"> into more and more</font>

194
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:26,229
secrecy which leads to more speculation

195
00:08:26,229 --> 00:08:28,599
and it leads to more conspiracies and

196
00:08:28,599 --> 00:08:32,469
more confusion among you know public

197
00:08:32,469 --> 00:08:36,070
opinion to be made so with<font color="#E5E5E5"> this video I</font>

198
00:08:36,070 --> 00:08:38,350
guess that<font color="#E5E5E5"> is my conclusion I</font>

199
00:08:38,350 --> 00:08:41,320
with ambush journalism if we are to go

200
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:44,070
with<font color="#CCCCCC"> that phrase um I completely</font>

201
00:08:44,070 --> 00:08:46,540
understand why we are change<font color="#E5E5E5"> of doing</font>

202
00:08:46,540 --> 00:08:48,250
what they do and actually I like a lot

203
00:08:48,250 --> 00:08:50,320
of what they've done but I kind of just

204
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:53,620
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to know what the end goal is is the</font>

205
00:08:53,620 --> 00:08:56,040
end goal to just obtain the truth and

206
00:08:56,040 --> 00:09:00,460
therefore is chasing these politicians

207
00:09:00,460 --> 00:09:03,070
the best way of getting the truth and of

208
00:09:03,070 --> 00:09:04,300
<font color="#CCCCCC">course there's a lot of you know i am</font>

209
00:09:04,300 --> 00:09:06,400
setting up the universal solutions

210
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:08,650
project and i don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> think it's an</font>

211
00:09:08,650 --> 00:09:10,750
either/or thing I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think in society we</font>

212
00:09:10,750 --> 00:09:12,250
need<font color="#E5E5E5"> people going out there being</font>

213
00:09:12,250 --> 00:09:14,710
citizen journalists helping report on

214
00:09:14,710 --> 00:09:16,720
the people that have the power but at

215
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:18,580
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> same time I think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the real truth</font>

216
00:09:18,580 --> 00:09:21,750
that we need to<font color="#CCCCCC"> get out there are</font>

217
00:09:21,750 --> 00:09:24,130
explanations of what the problems are in

218
00:09:24,130 --> 00:09:26,470
society and what are the solutions based

219
00:09:26,470 --> 00:09:30,370
on science and research and not

220
00:09:30,370 --> 00:09:32,980
political opinion so I just<font color="#E5E5E5"> wanted</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

221
00:09:32,980 --> 00:09:38,410
end on that thought I don't have an

222
00:09:38,410 --> 00:09:40,530
answer

223
00:09:42,870 --> 00:09:46,500
I appreciate with a video like<font color="#CCCCCC"> this it's</font>

224
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:48,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to attract a lot of supporters and</font>

225
00:09:48,300 --> 00:09:50,910
haters of we are<font color="#E5E5E5"> change and this isn't</font>

226
00:09:50,910 --> 00:09:53,490
about people with their own minds made

227
00:09:53,490 --> 00:09:55,440
up already<font color="#CCCCCC"> come here and like and</font>

228
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:57,540
dislike the video accordingly I actually

229
00:09:57,540 --> 00:09:59,640
want to discussion because as I've

230
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:01,500
already said i don't really know the

231
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:03,300
answer this question and<font color="#E5E5E5"> i know the</font>

232
00:10:03,300 --> 00:10:05,580
intentions are good but my question is

233
00:10:05,580 --> 00:10:07,860
<font color="#CCCCCC">about the end goal and whether what</font>

234
00:10:07,860 --> 00:10:11,160
you're trying to stop and<font color="#E5E5E5"> defeat I a</font>

235
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:13,650
secrecy is that actually going to be

236
00:10:13,650 --> 00:10:17,250
perpetuated by your very actions thank

237
00:10:17,250 --> 00:00:00,000
you oh<font color="#E5E5E5"> yes the next time</font>
