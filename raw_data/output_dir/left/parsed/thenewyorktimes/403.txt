Depending, you know, sometimes we’ll 
burn back from, say, like a cut over.
An area that's clear already, that, you 
know, it's not going to burn into,
for when the fire progresses towards it. 
Once it hits that burnt-out area
then it slows the progression right down.
We’re doing our best. We’ve opened our
doors up for over a good week now
to help the evacuees that require help.
We’re here until days end and
we’ve got to do what we've got to do.
It's in our blood to help every 
individual out, not just ourselves.
