1
00:00:04,589 --> 00:00:07,629
Job interviews in Japan are an etiquette minefield

2
00:00:07,629 --> 00:00:10,010
for foreigners and locals alike

3
00:00:10,010 --> 00:00:12,299
what to wear?

4
00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:14,990
uniformity is paramount

5
00:00:14,990 --> 00:00:23,620
Plain black suit, white shirt, black bag,
tie that's any color other than black or white

6
00:00:23,780 --> 00:00:29,000
always knock three times on the interviewer's
door

7
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:33,880
two knocks is for checking if a toilet cubicle
is vacant

8
00:00:33,880 --> 00:00:37,040
Occupied

9
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:45,320
say "excuse me," bow and walk to the left
side of the chair

10
00:00:49,210 --> 00:00:51,780
Make sure you're bowing correctly

11
00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:53,850
bend forward from the hips with a straight
back

12
00:00:53,850 --> 00:01:02,240
30 degrees upon entering, and 45 degrees when
you leave

13
00:01:05,099 --> 00:01:07,570
sit straight and don't lean back in your chair

14
00:01:07,570 --> 00:01:18,060
men, put one hand on each knee - women, keep
them in your lap

15
00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:22,380
and never, ever be late.

16
00:01:22,380 --> 00:00:00,000
or you may as well have stayed home
