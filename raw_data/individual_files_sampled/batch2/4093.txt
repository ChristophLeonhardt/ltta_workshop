presidential family member in White House aide Jared Kushner broke his silence today in his first extended TV interview since Trump was elected a 43 minute discussion that was often boastful sometimes defensive and at several points honestly bizarre now for context before I break this down here are some of the questions Kushner was presented with how did you get this job it's like the dopest job in the world like the Secretary of everything did the bug II wouldn't call it Secretary of everything so you having fun because I would hear about the chaos and the destruction and you guys are all gonna be just blown away by a media war called with you know Muller I mean from our point of view like you know you like pinatas over there you have any fun so that's what he was up against but Kushner's responses themselves presented an image of hard and quiet work I don't make a lot of noise so the noises sometimes made about me but I try to keep my head down now Jared Kushner is powerful but rarely heard so it is revealing to hear his own assessment of his work so far whether you agree with it or not so here is how Kushner grades himself on the assignment of achieving peace in the Middle East the president asked me to do the Middle East peace process which is something that I think we've made a lot of progress on as optimistic as you can be about that I was given the Middle East peace process between the Israelis and the Palestinians and I've dealt with a lot of the other regional partners in that effort a lot of progress other key words they're from Kushner but experts say there is almost no progress no peace deal and the principles in this process haven't even met in the past six months that's about 25% of the entire time Kushner has held this post now today Kushner said his other big priority other than the Middle East he's reforming the prison system he cited his father's time in prison and how he is working with Nancy Pelosi on a reform bill called the first step act and then there was one issue that was very close to my heart because I had a personal experience which was prison reform if you have somebody in prison for ten years you can say would you rather than go back after ten years of no programming to the streets it's called the first step back the goals for it to be the first step towards hopefully broader reforms I'm for progress on for moving forward and I'm hoping that a lot of the people in the House and the Senate will be with us as well he's hoping and obviously there are ways that Donald Trump has dabbled on an individual basis with pardons but Kushner has access to real power every day and yet let's get into the facts here are just three of the prison reform bills that are talked about regularly the smarter Sentencing Act the sentencing reform incorrect shion's Act and as he just mentioned the first step tactic so if this is one of Kushner's top priorities and he has this access to the president of any of these bills passed out of Congress or gotten floor votes to test their support no none of them have ever gotten a vote on the Senate floor let alone a presidential signature from his father-in-law so let's be clear whether the ideas expressed in those bills are good and whether mr. Kushner sincerely believes them is fine open question but Republicans can call it control Congress and when they get a real Trump priority from the Trump White House like tax cuts or judicial appointments or Supreme Court nominations they get votes so it's telling that here this is the result now those are Kushner's own stated priorities we also want to note that while he spoke for 43 minutes he didn't address his own record and conduct in matters like the Russia probe or his attendance at the Trump Tower meeting under investigation or advising on the firing of James Comey or his Mis statements regarding his security clearance this list as you may know if you watch the news goes on and on and on so on Kushner's own priorities on prison reform in Middle East peace no measurable result and on a bunch of those other issues no discussion whatsoever in this rare chance to address the public so here we are looking at this rare set of updates if you want to call them that from Jared Kushner and we have to ask how do you measure that kind of record for management well there is a way to do it we turn back to Jared Kushner who offered this tip today in business I would always say if you can't measure something you can't manage it hey I'm already Melbourne from MSNBC you can see more our videos right here or better yet subscribe to our YouTube channel below you could have been anywhere in the world that you're here with us and we appreciate that
