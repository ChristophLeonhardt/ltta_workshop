Disneyland considered a once-in-a-lifetime experience of adventure Wonder and joy but is there a flipside to the Magic Kingdom around 30,000 people work at the Disneyland Resort in California to make the dream a reality and according to a recent economic survey title working for the mouse seventy-three percent of employees find it tough to make ends meet some even struggle to keep a roof over their head arty talked to one employee as a housekeeper we are in church to clean 30 rooms a day which means we make the beds vacuum clean the toilets clean the showers that's a single mother it's very hard for example this past Christmas I need to choose between pay our rent or give a percentage of my kids unfortunately I need to a roof over me so I choose to pay the rent I was very hard very hard to say I'm sorry I don't have enough I'll tell you what Christmas is it's just another work day and any jackanapes who thinks else should be boiled in his own pudding well I choose to go to the cheapest supermarket and I choose to cheapest food which is means now the healthy food sometimes for pay oldies I need to work overtime as much I can sometimes one or two days on I'm working 14 hours a day Disneyland Resort dismisses the report saying they believe it to be quote an inaccurate and unscientific survey that's politically motivated but Veronica Chavez again says there are many people who are in the same position as her that is a lab or us at the same situation definitely they live in which we need more the affordable insurance for everybody and we need respect the saying I respect our job we need equality we need to fill paradise magic too
