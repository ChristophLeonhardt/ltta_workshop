all over the Western world throughout popular media and education women are being stripped of their access to the Divine Feminine they are being tricked into worshipping false idols of vanity and this isn't just about making women into men and denying them their femininity this is a project to strip women of their knowledge of what it is to be a woman it is one of the greatest ironies of our time that feminism has become one of the most anti women movements in our history picking up from the movement of equal rights feminism has taken a sharp left turn and now ROPS women of their understanding of the Divine Feminine duality of masculinity and femininity is an archetype of humanity there is equality in our duality we see this in the story of Adam and Eve men and women are co-creators we are partners we are opposites we are different but we are not competitors and our society is not a battleground the proper functioning of the universe relies on the harmonizing of the yin and yang the alchemical marriage it is the interaction between men and women for some the interaction and harmony between heaven and earth that creates the world around us without this harmony and without this difference our world would cease to be there for the attack on femininity by third wave feminists is not just creating terrible movies literature and comic books it is threatening our entire civilization robbing our Whang rights in the book in yang the transformation of yang Tian and Yang taeyang is enabled through techniques in which a man and woman work together including sexual practices the male does not stay alone and the female does not live unaccompanied Tigers turtles and snakes are intertwined together to mutually support each other this clarifies that male and female are jointly needed the masculine and feminine has been shattered men and women are pitted against each other we are being taught by a new generation of world leaders that men and women are AB Cerys not ours female archetypes like the fertility goddess the mother goddess or earth mother represent motherhood nature creation and destruction and fertility these are natural and divided and characteristics of femininity which are being lost every child born of the new generation when feminists call each other goddess when they claim to be empowering people they're actually stripping women of their maternal nature they are depriving women of something that is so fundamentally natural that it denies them of a part of their own soul this is not what Mother Goddess represents the female Ghostbusters movie and every other all woman reboot portray women as men whereas Ripley from the Alien franchise that began in 1979 is portrayed differently she isn't all DUP and wearing makeup but she is still uniquely female as film critic John Scalzi wrote in 2011 Ripley isn't a fantasy version of a woman science fiction film is filled with hot kick-ass women doing impossible things with guns and melee weapons while they spin about like a gymnast in a dryer as fun as that is to watch at the end of the day it's still given women short shrift since what they are then are idealized killer Fembots rather than actual human beings Ripley on the other hand is pushy aggressive rude injured suffering from post-traumatic syndrome not wearing makeup tired smart maternal angry empathetic and determined to save others even at great cost to herself all without being a skinny killbot the media has forgotten about heroines instead all we see are masculine females female bare-knuckle fighting on the big screen just makes strong women into a bloody spectacle it's fighting with no maternal purpose and that's the goal of the far left to remove all aspects of womanhood until we are all the same to remove the duality and stop the harmony of the yin and yang if you want to see more from me and the rest of the rebel team like and subscribe you
