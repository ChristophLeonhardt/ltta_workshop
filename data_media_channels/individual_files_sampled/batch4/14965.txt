they just say police arrest protesters really they don't say who he is but if you follow aunty or else ends politics even casually in this country you know who he is that man's name is Clayton Thomas Muller he's not from Burnaby he's not even from British Columbia he's from Manitoba three provinces over he's a professional protester he is paid by various us-funded lobby groups - he literally jetted to Vancouver to be part of that protest he got arrested on purpose but he wouldn't know that from the report would you you think it's just you know just British Columbians here is the seminal 2008 tar sands campaign document from the Rockefeller Brothers fund in New York I've shown this too many times before this is the first draft of the battle plan to attack oil sands and pipelines and look at the front groups that agreed to take foreign money to attack you in a sense I've shown this to you before there's the WWF in the top right corner do you see that that's Gerald Potts old organization he's working for Trudeau now but he used to be the president but you see that one sort of in the middle there it says the indigenous environmental network that's Clayton Thomas Muller he's worth a lot of these groups actually he's basically a Hollywood actor hired to give an Aboriginal look and feel to events so it's not all just white liberals from the US like Tom Sanborn there has never been an opinion poll in British Columbia that I've ever seen that has shown that the popular support is against pipelines if the pipelines are done in compliance with environmental standards which of course they are the Kinder Morgan transplanting expansion pipeline has been pumping away for nearly 70 years by the way without incident and it has actually been filling up tanker ships in the Port of Vancouver for decades without a single navigational incident ever this whole trans mountain thing is just a modernization and expansion of an existing pipeline so Bea Sears know in their bones it's normal it's fine it's safe and there's so many regulators scrutinizing it but if you only pay attention to the CBC or the Vancouver Sun you'd think everyone is against oil and gas and pipelines your neighbors your frame and normal just folks like Tom Sanborn who's at most disclosed as a professional writer oh and that handsome young Aboriginal man on the cover of the vancouver story no no Tom Sanborn is a professional activist clayton-thomas Muller is a professional activist who flew in just to make an appearance it's bad enough that our country is overrun with foreign funded extremists looking to shut down ethical oil to the benefit of OPEC conflict oil our competition but what about the mainstream media the Vancouver Sun for God's sakes that's either too lazy or too complicit to tell their viewers even the basic facts that's an excerpt from my daily TV show the Ezra Levant show normally it's behind a paywall but I thought you'd like this video so we put it on YouTube if you want to subscribe to watch the daily show every day including always two interviews a day and I read my hate mail just click on this screen and become a Premium Member you
