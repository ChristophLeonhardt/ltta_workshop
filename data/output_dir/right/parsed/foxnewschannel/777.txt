THIS WEEKS I WON THE SOCIETY
OF JOURNALIST AWARD FOR BEST
COLUMN APPEARS ON MONDAY IN
THE HILL.COM AND I WANT TO
THANK MY EDITORS BOB CUSACK
AS WELL AS THE PUBLISHER
JIMMY FINK KEL STEIN.
A LOT OF CRITICISM OF
JOURNALISM IN THE NEWS.
FAKE NEWS.
WE ARE LUCKY TO LIVE IN A
COUNTRY WHERE JOURNALISM AND
OPINION ARE AVAILABLE TO US
ALL.
THAT'S THE BASIS OF INFORMED
AMERICAN PEOPLE.
WE ARE THE BASIS OF THIS
GREAT PUBLIC.
