Naked mole rats are every bit
as strange as they sound.
They’re cold-blooded
mammals that
live underground in
big colonies run by a queen.
They almost never
get cancer
and they can survive for
18 minutes with zero oxygen.
They lose consciousness,
and their heart rate
and breathing slow
way down.
But as soon as oxygen
is available again,
they perk right up.
A mouse, on the other hand,
lasts about a minute.
Researchers at the
University of Illinois-Chicago,
along with colleagues
in Europe and Africa,
used a variety of
metabolic tests
to figure out
what was going on.
In low-oxygen environments —
pretty common underground —
mole rats can change
their energy metabolism,
in all their crucial organs,
so they don’t need oxygen.
They switch fuels,
like a hybrid car.
Instead of glucose
metabolized with oxygen,
they use fructose and
metabolize it without oxygen.
Knowing more about
this metabolic trick
might one day help in treating
heart attacks and strokes,
where a lack of
oxygen is a killer.
