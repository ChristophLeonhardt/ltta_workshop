all eyes are back on a Virginia courthouse where we have entered week two in the trial of president Trump's former campaign chairman Paul Manafort today Rick gates the prosecution's star witness took the stand and testified under oath that he had mana fort were involved in criminal activity together gates who has been described as mana forts right-hand man also admitted to embezzling hundreds of thousands of dollars from his longtime business partner Cates was originally charged as a co-conspirator in mana Ford's case but has been cooperating with Robert Miller's investigation after pleading guilty to conspiracy and lying to the FBI while the case will only be looking at mana for its business dealings gates also worked with him on Donald Trump's presidential campaign as the deputy campaign chair gates stayed on the campaign even after mana fort left and played a significant role in the presidential transition today's court appearance was the first time that gates and mana Ford have been in the same room together since gates made his plea deal for more on all of us I'm joined by Betsy Woodruff politics reporter for The Daily Beast and Ken Delaney an NBC News national security reporter who was at the Alexandria courthouse today ken let me start with you and just in terms of the basics the meat and potatoes here what exactly is it that Gates was admitting to today - everything Steve it was really rather remarkable I mean we knew most of this was gonna happen but still to see him walk into that courtroom Paul Manafort protege of 10 years he worked for him for from 2006 to 2016 and sit down at that witness stand just feet away from Paul Manafort was something incredible and manna fort was staring him down and gates tended not to look at manna for its direction nonetheless he was a pretty calm and compelling witness he was a little nervous but he testified that he had been charged with Paul Manafort in these bank and tax fraud indictments and he admitted that he was guilty of all those charges and that he had cut a deal with the prosecution to plead guilty to a lesser charge of charge involving lying to the FBI in exchange for a reduced sentence if he cooperated he laid all that out and then he also explained that in the course of this plea agreement he had to admit everything else bad that he did and that included something that the government didn't even know about which is that he was embezzling money who's stealing money from Paul Manafort while the on this alleged crime spree but you know defrauding banks and committing tax evasion gates was putting his hand into the cookie jar in the form of bogus expense reports essentially and he said it was worth about a couple of hundred thousand dollars he was essentially taking advantage of his ability to wire money from mana forts accounts and wiring money from overseas based on false expense accounts so there was that he also admitted some other lesser things including even being 15 minutes late for a curfew the point of all that Steve is that the prosecution wants no surprises when gates is cross-examined they want to confront the jury with everything that's bad about gates and say despite that you should believe him because essentially if he lies on the stand now this agreement is void and he's gonna go to prison for a long time because he's already pleaded guilty it was some pretty dramatic stuff and it continues tomorrow Steve yeah and that Betsy I guess that's the other thing that you know Kent says to be continued tomorrow that's probably the suspense now how will gates after admitting all this how will he handle he holed up under a cross-examination there's probably a lot there that the man afford site could hit him with that's right it's going to be bruising and additionally it's going to be personal there was significant friction several months back when rick gates was going through the process of deciding whether or not he was going to flip on Paul Manafort whether he was going to essentially turn on a man who had met his business partner in boss for upwards of a decade at the time that caused significant consternation on Manta Ford's team there are reports that man affords team up until the last moment thought gates was going to reject a plea deal they thought he was going to tough it out stand by manna for be sort of a loyal foot soldier be the loyal eye the loyal colleague they had always perceived though incorrectly had always perceived him to be but then at the last minute sort of when when push came to shove Gates decided no he was going to just cross the line work with Muller and his team and sort of abandon if you will his former colleague so this isn't just a question of legal machinations this is also very much a personal issue for gates manna fort manna for its legal team gates his legal team and you can expect to see that come through as gates faces cross-examination from manna forts attorneys yeah can I mean just just in terms of the human drama on this I mean I think of how many mafia movies have we seen were somebody flips they're in the courtroom and there's that moment when they basically they're staring you know what twenty feet away from the person they're flipping what was that like you say mana fort we're staring him down just set the scene we didn't have cameras in there what was it like to watch those two together it was pretty dramatic I mean admittedly it's hard for us in the courtroom to see manta 4 because we're looking at the back of his head but he seemed to be clearly staring gates down and gates did not want to look at him and and and I was told by one of our producers that during the break that that gates refused to look at manta 40 even though mana fort was staring at gates but let me make one other point Steve which is that even if Gates collapses on cross-examination and the jury doesn't believe a word that he says the prosecution still has a very strong case against Paul Manta for because this is a case about foreign bank accounts and we had testimony from anaphors bookkeepers and accountants that they had no idea that he had control of all these foreign bank accounts they prepared his tax returns and said that there were no foreign bank accounts that's a felony and and there's been reams of evidence that he was paying for all these luxury goods with money wired from Cyprus from foreign bank accounts that had nothing to do with gates and the only defense so far that we've seen to that is that mana fork didn't realize it was a crime he didn't realize he fill out the form incorrectly so it's a strong case with or without gates D yeah in Betsy we talked about this is not this case we're talking about right here it's the it's the finances it's not the it's not to do with the campaign but is there a connection there between what's being revealed what might be revealed that the fate that might meet Paul Manafort in this trial and the questions about his role in the campaign perhaps the biggest revelation that we've received from this trial for Muller steam is that what was initially believed to be a 10 million dollar loan that Putin ally and Russian aluminum oligarch Oleg Deripaska made to mana for wasn't actually a loan it was actually according to prosecutors a payment of ten million dollars now the fact that Deripaska made that significant payment to manna fort raises questions about the type of work manna fort was doing for Deripaska any loyalties that might have been there as well as additional frictions that existed between the man who would go on to be Trump's campaign chairman and a man who was very much in Putin's inner circle Deripaska subsequently has dude man affording gates has said that he thought they mishandled or stole even some of the money that he paid them so there's a lot of friction between those two men and during the presidential campaign reportedly mana for reached out to Deripaska world and suggested that potentially he would be willing to give Deripaska personal private updates on how the campaign was going so any subsequent revelations that we get in this trial about mana force relationship with Deripaska the types of loans and or payments Tara Pascoe is making to mana for when he was making those payments those revelations could potentially have implications for the way we view the work that mana Ford did when he was working on Trump's campaign hey there I'm Chris Hayes from MSNBC thanks for watching MSNBC on YouTube if you want to keep up to date with the videos we're
