SUCCESSFUL RELAUNCH AS HOWIE
KURTZ SAID.
SHE SHOULD HAVE BEEN ON TOP OF
THE WORLD.
>> TWITTER IS A FACT IS A
LESSER VERSION OF YOU.
NO MATTER WHO YOU ARE.
WHEN YOU GO ON TWITTER, YOU
ARE NEVER AS GOOD AS YOU ARE
AS A NORMAL PERSON.
I SAY THAT ABOUT MYSELF.
I DON’T LIKE WHO I AM ON
TWITTER.
IF YOU COMBINE A BUNCH OF
VARIABLES, WHETHER YOU ARE
DRINKING -- I ASSUME MIGHT BE
THE CASE.
BECAUSE WHAT SHE SAID WAS SO
HORRIBLE AND CRAZY.
BUT REALLY, TWITTER HAS BECOME
GLOBAL H.R.
IT USED TO BE IT WAS THE
CHRISTMAS PARTY THAT RUINED
YOU.
THAT IS HOW YOU LOST YOUR JOB.
NOW YOU CAN DESTROY YOUR OWN
CAREER BY GOING ON TO THIS
GLOBAL H.R., SAYING SOMETHING
COMPLETELY REPUGNANT AND THE
NEXT DAY YOU DON’T JUST LOSE
YOUR JOB BUT EVERYBODY YOU
LOSE WITH LOSES THEIR JOB.
MAKE YOU WAKE UP IN THE
MORNING AND YOU DON’T REMEMBER
YOU DID IT.
IT’S INTERESTING.
THERE IS SOMETHING ALSO ABOUT
COMEDIANS.
THEY ARE IN A NEW WORLD.
COMEDIANS EVERY TIME THEY
TALK, THEY ARE JUMPING OFF A
CLIFF.
THAT IS KIND OF HOW THEY
THINK.
THEY LIKE THAT IDEA.
>> Dana: THEY NEED TO HAVE
NO FEAR.
>> YES.
SO WHETHER IT’S ROSEANNE OR I
WOULD SAY HER LEFT WING
OPPOSITE WHICH IS ALEC
BALDWIN.
REMEMBER, ALEC BALDWIN LOST A
TALK SHOW AFTER THE FIRST OR
SECOND NIGHT AFTER HE MADE A
HOMOPHOBIC REMARK I THINK ON
THE STREET TO HIS REPORTER.
HIS SHOW WENT LIKE THAT.
OF COURSE HE GOT A SECOND
CHANCE AND MAYBE A THIRD
CHANCE.
WILL THEY AFFORD SECOND AND
THIRD CHANCES TO ROSEANNE?
I DON’T KNOW.
SHE HAS BEEN KNOWN TO SAY A
LOT OF CRAZY STUFF.
WE KNEW THAT.
I DID A MONOLOGUE PRAISING HER
SHOW BUT I KNEW SHE HAD ALWAYS
THE POTENTIAL TO SAY NUTTY
STUFF.
YOU LOOK AT GILBERT GODFRIED.
I DON’T KNOW IF YOU REMEMBER
HIS TWEETS AFTER THE JAPANESE
EARTHQUAKE.
>> Dana: YES.
>> COMEDIANS HAVE A THING
WHERE THEY SEE A CLIFF AND
THEY JUMP OFF OF IT.
THE OLD DAYS, YOU COULD GET
AWAY WITH IT.
NOT ANYMORE.
NOT WITH THE FACT THAT
EVERYTHING IS PERMANENT.
TWITTER IS THE BATHROOM WALL
FOR PLANET EARTH.
YOU CAN’T UNSCRUB IT.
SHE MADE A STUPID, FOOLISH
ERROR, MISTAKE.
NOW SHE IS PAYING FOR IT.
>> Dana: CAN I ASK ONE LAST
QUESTION BEFORE I LET YOU GO?
>> YES.
>> Dana: WHAT DO YOU THINK
OF THE TEMPTATION, THERE WILL
BE TEMPTATION FOR PEOPLE TO
CONFLATE ROSEANNE BARR AND TRY
TO SAY SHE IS REPRESENTATIVE
OF PRESIDENT TRUMP.
>> I THINK THAT YOU KNOW WHAT?
BOTH SIDES OFTEN DO THAT.
I HAVE DONE THAT.
WHEN ALEC BALDWIN SAYS
SOMETHING RIDICULOUS I’D GO,
OH, YOU LEFTISTS!
ALL YOU LEFTISTS ARE THE SAME!
I’D BRING UP AELECTION
BALDWIN.
WE ALL AS HUMANS IN OUR TRIBES
HAVE AN INSTINCT TO DO THAT.
I DON’T KNOW.
WE HAVE TO BE ABLE TO MOVE
BEYOND THIS KIND OF THING.
>> Dana: I SAID BUT I HAVE
ONE LAST QUESTION.
>> SURE.
>> Dana: DO YOU THINK IF
PEOPLE WERE TO GET OFF
TWITTER, RIGHT -- SHE SAID
BEFORE SHE GOT FIRED OKAY, I
APOLOGIZE.
IT WAS A JOKE.
I APOLOGIZE.
I’M NO LONGER GOING TO BE ON
TWITTER.
DO YOU THINK PEOPLE BELIEVE
THAT TWITTER IS WHAT GIVES
THEM SOME SORT OF POWER?
LIKE IT’S SOME SORT OF FUEL
FOR THEIR CAREERS?
>> YEAH, I THINK TWITTER
CREATES POTENTIAL FOR YOU TO
BE AN IDIOT.
I THINK WE HAVE BEEN TRICKED
INTO THINKING IT’S GOOD TO
PROMOTE STUFF AND YOU HAVE TO
BE OUT THERE AND YOU HAVE TO
HAVE TONS OF FOLLOWERS.
WHAT IT REALLY DOES IS IT JUST
CREATES ANOTHER OPENING FOR
YOU TO BE A JERK.
>> Dana: RIGHT.
POSSIBLY TO GET FIRED.
>> I COUNT MYSELF, BY THE WAY,
I COUNT MYSELF AMONG THE JERK
GROUP.
>> Dana: YOU REMEMBER THE
BOOK I WANT TO WRITE?
TWEETS I NEVER SENT.
>> I’M SURE THEY ARE AWFUL.
I HAVE HEARD YOU IN PRIVATE
MOMENTS.
YOU ARE DESPICABLE.
