u.s. has of course been a long ally of Israel with relations seemingly getting stronger since Donald Trump took office now it's kind of mopin explains next there's plenty of intrigue on just how close the ties between team Trump and Israel really are collusion is a popular accusation to throw around these days and a lot of what we're hearing working with a foreign government receiving money is what the Trump team did with Israel like undermining the policy of the current administration in favor of a foreign government Michael Flynn Trump's former national security adviser admits he called Russia and asked them to delay a vote at the UN Security Council that Israel didn't like on or about December 22nd 2016 a very senior member of the presidential transition team directed flee into contact officials from foreign governments to learn where each government stood on the resolution and to influence those governments to delay the vote or defeat the resolution Flynn informed the Russian ambassador about the incoming administration's opposition to the resolution and requested that Russia vote against or delay the resolution now we don't know who engineered it but take a look at this video of Higham saben the Israeli billionaire and Jared Kushner Trump's son-in-law seriously you and your team were taking steps to try and get the United Nations Security Council to not go along this crowd and myself want to thank you for making that effort so thank you very much and then there's Sheldon Adelson now he's an Israeli billionaire newspaper owner and he's also a top contributor to Israeli lobbyists bankrolling their activities well he threw in five million dollars to contribute to Donald Trump's inauguration now there's money and also personal chemistry the Trump family is quite close with Benjamin Netanyahu according to the New York Times Netanyahu even borrowed the bedroom of Jared Kushner when he was sleeping over at his mansion in New Jersey now the relationship is no secret Phoebe has even bragged about it can I reveal Jared how long we've known you Wow it was never small he was always big was always tall but I've I've known the president and I've known his family and his team for a long time so where is all this close and sometimes not so open cooperation gotten us well Donald Trump has now recognized Jerusalem as Israel's capital now this move is very pleasing to Israelis but it's quite explosive for the region but no one is keen to shout about this blatant teamwork unlike some other country that's constantly in the headlines Caleb Maupin RT New York
