00:00:03,149 --> 00:00:05,430
disenfranchised group where nobody was

3
00:00:05,430 --> 00:00:07,950
speaking up for them and that<font color="#CCCCCC"> was</font>

00:00:07,950 --> 00:00:11,070
<font color="#CCCCCC">japanese-americans here</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and so I just</font>

00:00:11,070 --> 00:00:13,950
feel very<font color="#E5E5E5"> strongly that today and 2017</font>

6
00:00:13,950 --> 00:00:44,430
we've gotta speak up there are no

7
00:00:44,430 --> 00:00:46,649
boundaries to this order so so

8
00:00:46,649 --> 00:00:48,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">unfortunately if there is no check</font>

00:00:48,210 --> 00:00:50,700
against what the what the president can

10
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:52,620
do in an executive order that's nothing

11
00:00:52,620 --> 00:00:54,320
there's nothing that stops him from

12
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:57,329
expanding the order further or extending

13
00:00:57,329 --> 00:00:59,399
it and saying you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> well it's 120</font>

14
00:00:59,399 --> 00:01:01,620

all of a sudden<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's permanent if</font>

16
00:01:03,030 --> 00:01:04,619
we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to have national security</font>

17
00:01:04,619 --> 00:01:06,990
and a super important we just can't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

18
00:01:06,990 --> 00:01:11,159
it under a framework where people from<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

19
00:01:11,159 --> 00:01:14,040
certain nationality are excluded that's

20
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:16,350
just something that I don't think any of

21
00:01:16,350 --> 00:01:18,450
us on our watch want to be saying that

22
00:01:18,450 --> 00:01:20,369
we stood by and<font color="#CCCCCC"> we're silent when that</font>

00:01:20,369 --> 00:00:00,000
was going on
