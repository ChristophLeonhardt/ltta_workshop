00:00:16,594 --> 00:00:17,428
YOU CAN PREORDER.

8
00:00:17,428 --> 00:00:20,364
>> IT'S LIKE A DAILY TORTURE.

9
00:00:20,364 --> 00:00:22,466
WE'LL GET THE NEWS AND MAKE SURE

10
00:00:22,466 --> 00:00:24,335
WE DON'T TALK ABOUT HIS NEW

11
00:00:24,335 --> 00:00:24,668
BOOK.

12
00:00:24,668 --> 00:00:27,671
WE ARE GOING TO DO AN HOUR ON MY

13
00:00:27,671 --> 00:00:30,274
RADIO SHOW, AN HOUR SPECIAL.

14
00:00:30,274 --> 00:00:33,377
I THINK IT'S SO FUNNY.

15
00:00:33,377 --> 00:00:35,112
HE'S A GENIUS.

16
00:00:35,112 --> 00:00:39,984
>> I SAID, GOT INTO THIS WITH

17
00:00:39,984 --> 00:00:41,151
LAURA.

18
00:00:41,151 --> 00:00:43,654
SHE SHOWED ME THE CLAPPER STUFF.

19
00:00:43,654 --> 00:00:45,422
HE DOESN'T LIKE TALKING ABOUT

20
00:00:45,422 --> 00:00:46,123
SPYING.

21
00:00:46,123 --> 00:00:49,360
I COULDN'T HELP MYSELF I SAID HE

22
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:50,995
WAS THE NATIONAL DIRECTOR OF

23
00:00:50,995 --> 00:00:51,428
INTELLIGENCE.

24
00:00:51,428 --> 00:00:54,164
HE WAS IN CHARGE OF EVERY SPY WE

25
00:00:54,164 --> 00:00:54,465
HAVE.

26
00:00:54,465 --> 00:00:57,635
HOW CAN YOU HAVE A DIRECTOR OF

27
00:00:57,635 --> 00:00:59,370
INTELLIGENCE THAT DOESN'T LIKE

28
00:00:59,370 --> 00:00:59,903
SPYING?

29
00:00:59,903 --> 00:01:01,939
THE WHOLE THING IS CRAZY.

30
00:01:01,939 --> 00:01:04,174
>> YOU ARE ONE OF THE SMALLEST

31
00:01:04,174 --> 00:01:04,708
PEOPLE I KNOW.

32
00:01:04,708 --> 00:01:06,977
>> IT'S A SMALL CIRCLE

33
00:01:06,977 --> 00:01:09,780
>> WE HAVE KNOWN EACH OTHER A

34
00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:10,681
LONG TIME.

35
00:01:10,681 --> 00:01:13,017
HERE'S WHERE WE ARE.

36
00:01:13,017 --> 00:01:18,455
HILLARY COMMITS FELONIES,

37
00:01:18,455 --> 00:01:20,824
OBSTRUCTS JUSTICE, WE COVER IT

38
00:01:20,824 --> 00:01:24,662
UP, WRITING ABOUT EXONERATION

39
00:01:24,662 --> 00:01:27,765
MONTH BEFORE IT'S DISCUSSED.

40
00:01:27,765 --> 00:01:30,267
NOW WE HAVE SPIES IN THE

41
00:01:30,267 --> 00:01:30,634
CAMPAIGN.

42
00:01:30,634 --> 00:01:34,304
WE HAVE FYZA JUDGES LIED TO,

43
00:01:34,304 --> 00:01:35,839
HILARY CLINTON BOUGHT AND PAID

44
00:01:35,839 --> 00:01:39,643
FOR DOSSIER THAT THE AUTHOR

45
00:01:39,643 --> 00:01:41,445
SAID, WRONG INTELLIGENCE, MAYBE

46
00:01:41,445 --> 00:01:42,546
50/50.

47
00:01:42,546 --> 00:01:46,450
THAT BECAME THE BASIS FOR A FYZA

48
00:01:46,450 --> 00:01:49,953
WARRANT AND THREE SUBSEQUENT

49
00:01:49,953 --> 00:01:50,421
RENEWALS.

50
00:01:50,421 --> 00:01:52,990
THIS IS THE BIGGEST CORRUPTION

51
00:01:52,990 --> 00:01:55,693
ABUSE OF POWER WE HAVE EVER

52
00:01:55,693 --> 00:01:56,593
SEEN?

53
00:01:56,593 --> 00:01:58,262
>> BY A HUGE MARGIN.

54
00:01:58,262 --> 00:02:00,597
I TALKED ABOUT THIS ON THE RADIO

55
00:02:00,597 --> 00:02:01,031
SHOW.

56
00:02:01,031 --> 00:02:03,734
WE NEED TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO

57
00:02:03,734 --> 00:02:04,301
SHOW THIS.

58
00:02:04,301 --> 00:02:07,104
WE HAVE THE CLINTON CORRUPTION

59
00:02:07,104 --> 00:02:09,806
GOING BACK MANY YEARS, BACK TO

60
00:02:09,806 --> 00:02:12,876
CATTLE FEATURES WHERE THE WALL

61
00:02:12,876 --> 00:02:15,846
STREET JOURNEY FIGURED OUT IT

62
00:02:15,846 --> 00:02:19,316
WAS MATHEMATICALLY IMPOSSIBLE TO

63
00:02:19,316 --> 00:02:23,053
MAKE THAT MUCH MONEY HONESTLY.

64
00:02:23,053 --> 00:02:24,922
THEY HAVE BEEN GETTING AWAY WITH

65
00:02:24,922 --> 00:02:27,157
IT SINCE 1990.

66
00:02:27,157 --> 00:02:29,093
THEN YOU HAVE THE PEOPLE THAT

67
00:02:29,093 --> 00:02:30,728
COVERED UP FOR HER CORRUPTION,

68
00:02:30,728 --> 00:02:32,796
THE EA

69
00:02:32,796 --> 00:02:34,598
THE E-MAILS AS PART OF THE

70
00:02:34,598 --> 00:02:35,265
CORRUPTION.

71
00:02:35,265 --> 00:02:36,633
THAT'S A SECOND LAYER.

72
00:02:36,633 --> 00:02:38,802
THEN YOU HAVE THE FEAR, TRUMP

73
00:02:38,802 --> 00:02:41,305
COULD WIN AND A THIRD LAYER, THE

74
00:02:41,305 --> 00:02:45,275
PEOPLE PROTECTING HER, THERE WAS

75
00:02:45,275 --> 00:02:48,512
A WONDERFUL LINE, HE WROTE,

76
00:02:48,512 --> 00:02:50,881
DEMOCRATS GET AWAY WITH MURDER

77
00:02:50,881 --> 00:02:56,253
AND REPUBLICANS GET MURDERED.

78
00:02:56,253 --> 00:02:58,555
NOW HERE IS WHAT I BEGAN TO

79
00:02:58,555 --> 00:03:02,459
REALIZE IN THE LAST FEW DAYS,

80
00:03:02,459 --> 00:03:04,261
ALL OF A SUDDEN THE GUYS THAT

81
00:03:04,261 --> 00:03:06,263
PLANNED TO BASK IN CORRUPTION

82
00:03:06,263 --> 00:03:10,334
REALIZE THEY COULD BE INDICTED

83
00:03:10,334 --> 00:03:11,301
AND CONVICTED.

84
00:03:11,301 --> 00:03:14,271
I HAVE KNOWN CLAPPER FOR YEARS.

85
00:03:14,271 --> 00:03:16,607
HE USED TO BE A SERIOUS

86
00:03:16,607 --> 00:03:17,174
PROFESSIONAL.

87
00:03:17,174 --> 00:03:21,044
THE GUY I SEE ON T.V. NOW IS

88
00:03:21,044 --> 00:03:21,411
PATHETIC.

89
00:03:21,411 --> 00:03:23,747
>> WHAT ABOUT BRENNAN?

90
00:03:23,747 --> 00:03:26,850
>> ONLY OBAMA WOULD PICK A

91
00:03:26,850 --> 00:03:33,590
COMMUNIST TO BE HEAD OF THE FBI.

92
00:03:33,590 --> 00:03:35,893
BRENNAN HAS THE PROBLEM, COMEY

93
00:03:35,893 --> 00:03:42,032
HAS THE PROBLEM, MCNAB HAS THE

94
00:03:42,032 --> 00:03:43,867
PROBLEM, LYNCH HAS THE PROBLEM.

95
00:03:43,867 --> 00:03:45,869
YOU ARE GOING TO FIND OUT IT

96
00:03:45,869 --> 00:03:47,070
GOES TO THE WHITE HOUSE.

97
00:03:47,070 --> 00:03:48,505
>> NO DOUBT.

98
00:03:48,505 --> 00:03:50,641
>> ZERO DOUBT.

99
00:03:50,641 --> 00:03:53,377
I CAN'T IMAGINE BARACK OBAMA NOT

100
00:03:53,377 --> 00:03:53,710
KNOWING.

101
00:03:53,710 --> 00:03:56,446
>> IF THE TRUTH COMES OUT, IT

102
00:03:56,446 --> 00:04:00,984
WILL GO TO THE OBAMA WHITE HOUSE

103
00:04:00,984 --> 00:04:03,086
AND POWER AND THE REST OF THEM.

104
00:04:03,086 --> 00:04:05,656
>> GIVEN THE WAY THEY RAN A

105
00:04:05,656 --> 00:04:07,324
TIGHT OPERATION.

106
00:04:07,324 --> 00:04:10,627
DOES ANYONE BELIEVE VALERIE

107
00:04:10,627 --> 00:04:12,129
JARRETT DIDN'T KNOW THIS STUFF?

108
00:04:12,129 --> 00:04:17,267
>> THEY GAVE THE NEW YORK TIMES

109
00:04:17,267 --> 00:04:18,502
TO SPIN IT.

110
00:04:18,502 --> 00:04:20,870
THEY REVEALED WHEN THE TRIP TOOK

111
00:04:20,870 --> 00:04:23,807

00:04:27,945 --> 00:04:30,647
TO BE AT THE TOP FOR HIM TO

115
00:04:30,647 --> 00:04:34,818
ALLOW THE INTERVIEW BY THE FBI.

116
00:04:34,818 --> 00:04:37,621
>> THE GUY WE HAVE IDENTIFIED

117
00:04:37,621 --> 00:04:39,923
WHO IS NOT IDENTIFIED AND ALL

118
00:04:39,923 --> 00:04:42,993
THIS BOLOGNA WHO GOT A MILLION

119
00:04:42,993 --> 00:04:44,094
DOLLARS FROM THE DEEP STATE.

120
00:04:44,094 --> 00:04:45,462
>> TWO YEARS.

121
00:04:45,462 --> 00:04:48,198
YOU START SAYING, OH, IT'S

122
00:04:48,198 --> 00:04:51,969
OKAY -- AND WHAT I READ WAS

123
00:04:51,969 --> 00:04:54,004
ENTRAPMENT.

124
00:04:54,004 --> 00:04:56,807
>> HE'S SAYING TO THIS GUY, COME

00:04:56,807 --> 00:05:00,210
ON, GIVE ME, GIVE ME.

126
00:05:00,210 --> 00:05:02,946
>> THERE WAS EVEN A CUTE BLONDE.

127
00:05:02,946 --> 00:05:05,983
>> THERE AIN'T NOTHING THERE.

128
00:05:05,983 --> 00:05:07,951
>> HILLARY WINS, NOTARY PUBLIC

NONE OF THISCOMES OUT.

131
00:05:11,188 --> 00:05:12,656
ARE YOU CONFIDENT WE HAVE THE

132
00:05:12,656 --> 00:05:13,824
ABILITY TO GET TO THE TRUTH?

133
00:05:13,824 --> 00:05:15,025
>> NO.

134
00:05:15,025 --> 00:05:17,160
>> NEITHER AM I.

135
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:20,430
>> WHAT IT'S GOING TO COME DOWN

136
00:05:20,430 --> 00:05:21,865
TO IS WHETHER OR NOT THE

137
00:05:21,865 --> 00:05:23,467
PRESIDENT CAN KEEP FOCUSED.

138
00:05:23,467 --> 00:05:24,201
>> HE IS.

139
00:05:24,201 --> 00:05:27,371
>> HE IS NOW.

140
00:05:27,371 --> 00:05:30,107
THIS IS GOING TO GO ON TWO AND

141
00:05:30,107 --> 00:05:30,674
THREE YEARS.

142
00:05:30,674 --> 00:05:33,076
>> THEY ARE SETTING TRAPS FOR

143
00:05:33,076 --> 00:05:34,278
HIM TO GET MAD AND FIRE.

144
00:05:34,278 --> 00:05:36,613
>> DIGGING THE STUFF OUT, MAKING

145
00:05:36,613 --> 00:05:37,881
THE CONNECTIONS.

00:05:37,881 --> 00:05:39,950
WHAT IS JEFF SESSIONS DOING?

147
00:05:39,950 --> 00:05:41,184
WHAT IS WRONG WITH HIM?

148
00:05:41,184 --> 00:05:43,654
>> IF WE HAD AN ATTORNEY

149
00:05:43,654 --> 00:05:44,121
GENERAL?

I DON'T KNOW WHAT HAPPENED TO

154
00:05:54,464 --> 00:05:55,332
HIM.

155
00:05:55,332 --> 00:05:57,200
