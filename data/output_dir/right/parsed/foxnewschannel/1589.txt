MALIGN ACTIVITIES AND SUPPORT OF
TERRORISM AND VIOLENCE ACROSS
THE REGION.
>> Martha: SO WHERE ARE WE
HEADING HERE?
TRAINING ALEX CLOSELY,
SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM,
SOUTH CAROLINA REPUBLICAN WHO
SERVES ON THE SENATE JUDICIARY
AND ARMED SERVICES COMMITTEE.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
>> WHAT A BEAUTIFUL VIEW.
>> Martha: ISN'T IT A GREAT
PLACE TO BE?
THANKS FOR BEING UP HERE ON THE
ROOF WITH US TONIGHT.
IT'S PUT UP MIKE POMPEO'S TWEET
HERE TODAY.
THE NEW SECRETARY OF STATE.
HE SAYS TO THE IRANIAN PEOPLE,
DO YOU WANT YOUR COUNTRY TO BE
KNOWN AS A COCONSPIRATOR WITH
HEZBOLLAH, HAMAS, TALIBAN AND
AL QAEDA?
THE UNITED STATES SAYS YOU
DESERVE BETTER.
WHERE IS THIS GOING?
>> I LOVE WHAT THEY ARE DOING.
WE'VE HAD EIGHT YEARS OF WEAK
FOREIGN POLICY.
JOHN KERRY AND BARACK OBAMA
WOULD HAVE CRAWLED THROUGH GLASS
TO GET A DEAL WITH THE IRANIANS.
IT'S A TERRIBLE DEAL.
AFTER TEN YEARS, ALL THE
RESTRICTIONS ON THE ENRICHMENT
PROGRAM GO AWAY.
I'M GLAD WE WITHDREW, BUT HERE'S
WHAT YOU NEED TO ASK THE
EUROPEANS, WHY ARE YOU STANDING
WITH THE AYATOLLAH?
THE ARABS AND ISRAELIS ARE WITH
US.
I THINK THE IRANIAN PEOPLE WANT
TO BE WITH US.
WHEN THEY WENT OUT TO THE
STREETS THEY GOT SHOT DOWN LIKE
DOGS.
WHAT MAKES YOU THINK AYATOLLAH
WOULDN'T KILL YOUR KIDS IF YOU
WOULD KILL HIS OWN KIDS?
>> Martha: WHAT DO YOU THINK
IS GOING TO HAPPEN WITH THE
EUROPEAN ALLIES?
CLEARLY LIVING THE
STATE DEPARTMENT IS DISCUSSING
THIS WITH THEM AND WANTS THEM TO
COME ALONG WITH THE DEAL.
>> THEY WILL FOLD LIKE A CHEAP
SUIT.
IF YOU HAVE TO PICK WITH THE
AMERICAN ECONOMY AND THE IRANIAN
ECONOMY YOU WILL PICK THE
AMERICAN ECONOMY.
THERE'S NOTHING THAT YOU WANT
FROM THE EUROPEANS WHEN IT COMES
TO DEALING WITH ROGUE NATIONS
LIKE IRAN.
AGAIN, THE EUROPEANS AND THE
OBAMA ADMINISTRATION PUT IRAN ON
A PATHWAY TO A BOMB.
DONALD TRUMP HAS GIVEN THEM A
DIFFERENT CHOICE.
YOU CAN HAVE A BETTER LIFE, BUT
YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO CHANGE
THE LIFE YOU ARE LEADING.
YOU HAVE TO STOP DESTROYING THE
MIDDLE EAST, TRUMP HAS BEEN
DEALT A TOUGH HAND WITH
NORTH KOREA AND IRAN AND I LIKE
THE WAY HE'S PLAYING THE HAND.
TELL THE EUROPEAN ALLIES STAND
UP FOR YOUR VALUES.
WHAT YOU HAVE IN COMMON WITH THE
AYATOLLAH?
>> Martha: ARE WE ENCOURAGING
REVOLT ON THE PART OF THE
IRANIAN PEOPLE?
>> THEY'VE DONE IT BEFORE.
>> Martha: WE DIDN'T BACK THEM
UP.
I'M WONDERING WHAT WE ARE GOING
TO DO THIS TIME.
>> REMEMBER WHEN THE YOUNG LADY
HAD A SIGN IN THE CECUM ARE YOU
WITH US OR ARGUE WITH THEM,
PRESIDENT OBAMA?
HE CLEARLY DIDN'T WANT TO
JEOPARDIZE HIS NEGOTIATIONS WITH
THE IRANIAN REGIME.
LOOK WHAT THEY GOT YOU, A
STRONGER IRAN.
THEY'VE GOT MORE CAPABILITY TO
WREAK HAVOC ON ISRAEL THAN THEY
DID BEFORE THE DEAL.
>> Martha: IS THIS
NORTH KOREAN SUMMIT GOING TO
HAPPEN ON JUNE 12TH?
>> IN THE LAST 30 DAYS TRUMP HAS
DONE TO COPE VERY BOLD THINGS.
HE SAID I WILL SIT DOWN
PERSONALLY WITH KIM JONG UN TO
FIND A WAY TO AVOID A WAR WITH
NORTH KOREA.
I WILL GET OUT WITH OF A BAD
DEAL WITH IRAN TO SEE IF I CAN
GET A BETTER DEAL.
HE'S DOING THE THINGS I WOULD
HOPE YOU WOULD DO AS PRESIDENT.
IF THE NORTH KOREANS STIFFED
HIM, IF THEY SAT DOWN AND MEET
WITH HIM AND TRY TO PLAY THEM
THEY ARE GOING TO GET IT.
AND IF THEY DON'T MEET JUNE
JUNE 12TH.
THAT'S PROBABLY THE END
DIPLOMACY.
PLAN B WOULD BE THE MILITARY TO
STOP THE THREAT NORTH KOREA
PRESENTS.
I HOPE WE DON'T GO DOWN THAT
ROAD BUT TRUMP WILL HAVE NO
OTHER CHOICE IF THE SUMMIT IS
CANCELED AND NORTH KOREA DOESN'T
WANT TO WORK WITH US IN GOOD
FAITH TO MAKE IT A WIN-WIN, THEN
WE ARE GOING TO HAVE A CONFLICT
BETWEEN DONALD TRUMP AND
KIM JONG UN AND TRUMP WILL WIN.
>> Martha: WHAT YOU THINK
ABOUT THE REPORTS THAT THE
PRESIDENT BECAME ENAMORED OF
THIS IDEA THAT MAYBE HE WOULD
GET THE NOBEL PEACE PRIZE.
>> I STARTED THAT, BY THE WAY.
>> Martha: THAT MADE HIM WANT
TO STEAL ENOUGH THAT HE WAS
WILLING TO SORT OF MAKE IT
HAPPEN NO MATTER WHAT.
HOW THE STORIES ARE THAT HE
DOESN'T WANT TO BE EMBARRASSED
THERE AND HE'S LOOKING
POTENTIALLY FOR A WAY TO NOT DO
IT.
>> I TALKED TO HIM THREE DAYS
AGO.
HERE'S WHAT HE TOLD ME, HE SAID
I'M GOING TO END THIS ONE WAY OR
ANOTHER.
I DON'T WANT A NEW WAR WITH
NORTH KOREA.
IT WOULD BE DEVASTATING FOR THE
THE REGION, BUT THEY WOULD LOSE
IT, NOT US.
I'M GOING TO SIT DOWN WITH THIS
GUY AND TRY TO FIND A WIN-WIN.
I'M GOING TO TELL TRY AND I NEED
YOUR HELP, UP YOUR GAME.
AT THE END OF THE DATE DOES
DONALD TRUMP HAVE THE RESOLVE TO
BE DIFFERENT THAN ANY OTHER
PRESIDENT?
DOES HE REALLY MEAN IT WHEN HE
SAYS HE WANTS A BETTER DEAL WITH
THE IRANIANS AND HE'S NOT GOING
TO GIVE IN WHEN IT GETS ONE?
DOES HE REALLY MEAN THAT HE
WOULD STOP NORTH KOREA FROM
GETTING A NUCLEAR WEAPON THAT
COULD HIT AMERICA AND USE
MILITARY FORCE IF HE HAD TO?
HERE'S WHAT I THINK.
I THINK HE REALLY MEANS IT AND
IF HE MISJUDGE OR MISS
CALCULATES, IT WILL BE THE
BIGGEST MISTAKE NORTH KOREA EVER
MAKES.
I DON'T WANT TO WORK, BUT IF A
WAR IS GOING TO HAPPEN IT'S
GOING TO BE IN THEIR BACKYARD,
NOT OURS.
>> Martha: YOU'VE BEEN AROUND
THIS TOWN A LONG TIME.
YOU RAN FOR PRESIDENT.
>> I FINISHED IN THE TOP 15.
>> Martha: I REMEMBER.
WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT THIS FBI
SITUATION AND WHETHER OR NOT
THEY HAD AN INFORMANT WHO WAS
TALKING TO PEOPLE IN THE TRUMP
CAMPAIGN?
>> IT COMES FROM A THIRD WORLD
MODEL, SOMETHING THAT SORT OF
SMALL COUNTRIES DO.
I WANT TO FIND OUT WHAT WAS THAT
ALL ABOUT?
YOU CAN'T HAVE ONE
ADMINISTRATION SPYING ON
ANOTHER.
DIDN'T, BUT THE DEPARTMENT OF
JUSTICE AND THE FBI GAVE CLINTON
A PASS.
IF HE HAD DONE WHAT SHE HAD DONE
HE WOULD BE IN JAIL RIGHT NOW.
I'VE SEEN BIAS AT THE DEPARTMENT
OF JUSTICE REGARDING THE CLINTON
EMAIL INVESTIGATION.
I'VE SEEN BIAS AGAINST
PRESIDENT TRUMP THAT THE FBI AND
THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE.
I'VE SEEN DOCUMENTS FROM A PAID
POLITICAL INFORMANT, FOREIGN
AGENT WORKING WITH THE RUSSIANS
PAID BY THE DEMOCRATS TO GET A
WARRANT ON AN AMERICAN CITIZEN.
THAT ALL BOTHERS ME SO I HOPE
SOMEBODY WILL LOOK AT IT, MAYBE
MR. HORWITZ IS THE RIGHT GUY BUT
I THINK WE NEED A SPECIAL
COUNSEL.
>> Martha: A SECOND SPECIAL
COUNSEL?
>> THIS JUST REALLY STINKS TO
HIGH HEAVEN.
I'M ALL FOR MUELLER DOING HIS
JOB BUT THERE'S NOT ONE DEMOCRAT
WHO SEEMS TO CARE ONE BIT ABOUT
THE FACT THAT ALL THIS IS
HAPPENING.
CAN YOU IMAGINE THE SHOE ON THE
OTHER FOOT?
SOMEONE WAS INVESTIGATING TRUMP
AND THE HEAD OF THE FBI
INVESTIGATING TEAM HATED TRUMP
AND LIKE CLINTON?
IT WOULD BE ON THE FRONT PAGE --
WHAT IF THE REPUBLICAN PARTY HAD
HIRED SOMEBODY TO GO TO RUSSIA
