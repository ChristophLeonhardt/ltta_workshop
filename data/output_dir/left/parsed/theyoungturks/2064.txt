WISCONSIN GOV.'S GOT WALKER HAS
BEEN ORDERED BY JUDGES TO FILL
TWO VACANT LEGISLATIVE SEATS BY
CALLING FOR A SPECIAL ELECTION.
THIS IS SOMETHING WALKER DID NOT
WANT TO DO AND I WILL GIVE
YOU THE REASONS IN JUST 
A
MINUTE.
HE WANTED LAWMAKERS TO CHANGE
THEIR ELECTION LAW SO THEY
WOULDN'T HAVE TO HAVE THE
SPECIAL ELECTION.
JUDGES GOT INVOLVED AND SAID
YOU NEED TO CALL A SPECIAL
ELECTION AND IT NEEDS TO HAPPEN
IMMEDIATELY.
SPECIAL ELECTIONS WILL HAPPEN ON
JUNE 12 AND TO GIVE YOU SOME
IDEA INTO THE STORY, IT ALL
BEGAN Ã± SO THEY MOVE ON TO SERVE
WALKER, AND SERVE FOR HIS
ADMINISTRATION BUT THOSE
CONSTITUENTS THAT THEY LEFT
BEHIND NEED TO BE REPRESENTED.
WALKER DIDN'T WANT TO HAVE THAT
ELECTION AND PART OF THE REASON
WHY IS BECAUSE DISTRICTS THAT
HAVE ACTUALLY DONE VERY WELL FOR
TRUMP ARE NOW STARTING TO FLIP
AND HE DOESN'T LIKE THAT.
LET'S
MOVE ON TO GRAPHIC 34.
WALKER
HAD TREATED ABOUT IT AT THE TIME
AND SAID REPUBLICAN SHOULD BE
CONCERNED.
HE MADE IT CLEAR HE WAS ALARMED
AND CONCERNED WHICH IS WHY HE
WANTED TO PREVENT THIS SPECIAL
ELECTION FROM HAPPENING.
WALKER COMPLAINED BY SAYING THAT
ERIC HOLDER AND OTHER LIBERALS
ARE USING THE SITUATION TO RAISE
MONEY FOR THEIR BATTLES.
IT IS JUST FUNNY, THE
PROJECTION.
BECAUSE THAT IS WHAT I DO IS
THE REST OF THAT TWEET.
THOSE PEOPLE DESERVE TO BE
REPRESENTED AND HE WENT TO SUCH
EXTREMES TO THE WAY THIS CITY
COULD ACTUALLY REWRITE A LAW TO
PREVENT THERE FROM BEING THE
SELECTION SPEAKS TO HOW THEY
WILL DEAL WITH THE BOTTOM OF THE
DECK.
ANNA MADE A GOOD POINT THAT WE
GET ANGRY WITH THEM BECAUSE THEY
ARE SO BRAZEN AND NAKED IN THE
WAY TO GO AFTER THE
REDISTRICTING AND THEY TAKE
CONTROL OF GOVERNMENT AND THEY
DON'T EVEN TAKE STOCK OF THE
OTHER SIDE SO THAT THERE CAN BE
SOME KIND OF COMPROMISE TO
ADDRESS ALL PARTIES FOR AT LEAST
LISTEN TO ALL PARTIES.
THEY WANT TO ACTUALLY CHANGE
LEGISLATION TO AVOID AN
ELECTION.
AND WAS SAYING I AM SICK OF
THIS, WE PLAY NICE AND TRY TO
FIND COMPROMISE, AND THEY GO
OUTSIDE OF THE BOUNDS.
THIS IS DEALING OFF THE BOTTOM
OF THE DECK, THAT IS WHAT SCOTT
WALKER IS DOING
TO GIVE YOU MORE CONTACTS,
THOSE TWO SEATS HAVE BEEN VACANT
SINCE DECEMBER 2017.
WE ARE NOW QUICKLY APPROACHING
APRIL 2018.
PART OF WALKER'S ARGUMENT WAS
THAT SPECIAL ELECTION IS A WASTE
OF TAXPAYER MONEY BECAUSE WE
WILL CALL THE ELECTION AND SOON
ENOUGH THOSE TWO INDIVIDUALS
WILL HAVE TO RUN FOR
REELECTION SO WHY WOULD WE HOLD
THE ELECTION NOW.
I GUESS IF THESE SEATS BECAME
VACANT TODAY, I STILL
WOULDN'T BUY IT.
THESE SEATS HAVE BEEN VACANT
SINCE LAST YEAR.
HE PURPOSELY HAS BEEN PUSHING
THIS FURTHER DOWN THE ROAD IN AN
EFFORT TO PREVENT THE
POSSIBILITY OF A DEMOCRAT
GETTING ELECTED.
BY THE WAY EVEN AS BEST CASE
SCENARIO FOR THE LEFT TO
DEMOCRATS DO GET ELECTED,
REPUBLICAN STILL CONTROL
THE LEGISLATURE.
IT IS JUST THAT HE IS TOO AFRAID
TO SEE WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IN
THESE ELECTIONS.
HE DOESN'T WANT TO GIVE UP ANY
GROUND.
THE GOOD THING HE CAN SAY IS
THAT THE STATE IS SHIFTING.
