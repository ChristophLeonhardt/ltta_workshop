1
00:00:00,464 --> 00:00:02,233
WILL BE ANY AGREEMENT.

2
00:00:02,233 --> 00:00:04,702
TONIGHT, CORRESPONDENT

3
00:00:04,702 --> 00:00:06,003
GILLIAN TURNER LOOKS AT WHAT

4
00:00:06,003 --> 00:00:06,904
IS STANDING IN THE WAY.

5
00:00:06,904 --> 00:00:08,172
>> JUST BECAUSE WE ARE NOT

6
00:00:08,172 --> 00:00:09,874
THERE NOW, DOESN'T MEAN

7
00:00:09,874 --> 00:00:11,042
CAN'T BE THERE LATER TODAY

8
00:00:11,042 --> 00:00:11,776
OR LATER TOMORROW.

9
00:00:11,776 --> 00:00:12,910
>> JUST YESTERDAY, THE

10
00:00:12,910 --> 00:00:13,945
PRESIDENT CALLED OFF THE

11
00:00:13,945 --> 00:00:15,213
NORTH KOREAN NUCLEAR SUMMIT.

12
00:00:15,213 --> 00:00:17,515
BUT TODAY HE IS OPTIMISTIC,

13
00:00:17,515 --> 00:00:18,416
OFFERING ENCOURAGEMENT AND

14
00:00:18,416 --> 00:00:19,617
EVEN FLOATING THE

15
00:00:19,617 --> 00:00:21,352
POSSIBILITY OF REVIVING IT

16
00:00:21,352 --> 00:00:22,386
THE NATIONAL SECURITY

17
00:00:22,386 --> 00:00:23,354
EXPERTS SAY THERE IS A LOT

18
00:00:23,354 --> 00:00:25,623
OF HOPE BUT THOUGHT MUCH

19
00:00:25,623 --> 00:00:26,057
CHANCE.

20
00:00:26,057 --> 00:00:28,559
THEY CAUTION PRESIDENT TRUMP

21
00:00:28,559 --> 00:00:30,761
WILL HAVE TO OVERCOME MAJOR

22
00:00:30,761 --> 00:00:31,796
OBSTACLES IF HE STILL HOPES

23
00:00:31,796 --> 00:00:33,064
TO ULTIMATELY STRIKE A DEAL

24
00:00:33,064 --> 00:00:33,664
WITH KIM JONG UN.

25
00:00:33,664 --> 00:00:34,866
LIKE THE FACT THAT

26
00:00:34,866 --> 00:00:37,235
WASHINGTON AND PYONGYANG

27
00:00:37,235 --> 00:00:37,935
STILL MISUNDERSTAND ONE

28
00:00:37,935 --> 00:00:38,970
ANOTHER ON KEY ISSUES.

29
00:00:38,970 --> 00:00:39,971
>> WHEN THE UNITED STATES

30
00:00:39,971 --> 00:00:42,373
HAS BEEN TALKING ABOUT

31
00:00:42,373 --> 00:00:43,608
DENUCLEARIZATION, IT'S OFTEN

32
00:00:43,608 --> 00:00:45,243
ACCOMPANIED BY THE IDEA OF

33
00:00:45,243 --> 00:00:47,411
COMPLETE VERIFIABLE

34
00:00:47,411 --> 00:00:48,079
IRREVERSIBLE

35
00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:48,579
DENUCLEARIZATION.

36
00:00:48,579 --> 00:00:50,248
WHEN THE NORTH TALKS ABOUT

37
00:00:50,248 --> 00:00:50,915
DENUCLEARIZATION, THEY ARE

38
00:00:50,915 --> 00:00:51,582
SAYING THAT THE UNITED

39
00:00:51,582 --> 00:00:53,284
STATES NOT ONLY NEEDS TO

40
00:00:53,284 --> 00:00:54,719
WITHDRAW ANY NUCLEAR WEAPONS

41
00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:56,020
IT MIGHT HAVE ON THE

42
00:00:56,020 --> 00:00:57,221
PENINSULA, BUT THAT THE U.S.

43
00:00:57,221 --> 00:00:59,957
ALSO SHOULD NOT, CANNOT

44
00:00:59,957 --> 00:01:02,827
THREATEN NUCLEAR USE ON THE

45
00:01:02,827 --> 00:01:03,194
PENINSULA.

46
00:01:03,194 --> 00:01:04,095
>> EVEN IF NORTH KOREA AND

47
00:01:04,095 --> 00:01:05,830
THE U.S. WORK OUT THIS

48
00:01:05,830 --> 00:01:07,298
DIFFERENCE AHEAD OF THE

49
00:01:07,298 --> 00:01:07,965
SUMMIT, THERE IS STILL THE

50
00:01:07,965 --> 00:01:09,600
RISK THAT OTHER COUNTRY ALSO

51
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:10,768
INTERVENAL AND TRY TO DERAIL

52
00:01:10,768 --> 00:01:11,168
THE TALK.

53
00:01:11,168 --> 00:01:13,037
>> CHINA DOES NOT WANT TO

54
00:01:13,037 --> 00:01:14,472
SEE PRESIDENT TRUMP TALK TO

55
00:01:14,472 --> 00:01:15,907
KIM JONG UN DIRECTLY.

56
00:01:15,907 --> 00:01:17,508
BECAUSE THAT MEANS HAS BEEN

57
00:01:17,508 --> 00:01:19,343
CUT OUT OF THE PROCESS.

58
00:01:19,343 --> 00:01:21,012
>> RUSSIA IS ALSO DESPERATE

59
00:01:21,012 --> 00:01:21,512
TO GET INVOLVED.

60
00:01:21,512 --> 00:01:22,713
>> THE MOST INTERESTING

61
00:01:22,713 --> 00:01:23,748
ELEMENT HERE ALSO IS THAT

62
00:01:23,748 --> 00:01:25,383
VLADIMIR PUTIN HAS DECIDED

63
00:01:25,383 --> 00:01:27,285
TO ONCE AGAIN TRY AND PLAY A

64
00:01:27,285 --> 00:01:30,554
ROLE HERE WHERE HE WAS

65
00:01:30,554 --> 00:01:32,023
PRAISING KIM JONG UN AND

66
00:01:32,023 --> 00:01:32,757
CONDEMNING DONALD TRUMP.

67
00:01:32,757 --> 00:01:34,592
SO, CERTAINLY, ANOTHER

68
00:01:34,592 --> 00:01:36,794
POSSIBILITY MIGHT BE

69
00:01:36,794 --> 00:01:37,728
INFLUENCE FROM MOSCOW.

70
00:01:37,728 --> 00:01:39,163
>> FINALLY, EVEN IF THE

71
00:01:39,163 --> 00:01:40,731
SUMMIT DOES GET RESCHEDULED,

72
00:01:40,731 --> 00:01:42,633
THERE ARE ALWAYS UNEXPECTED

73
00:01:42,633 --> 00:01:43,267
PRACTICAL CONSIDERATIONS

74
00:01:43,267 --> 00:01:44,368
THAT CAN GET IN THE WAY.

75
00:01:44,368 --> 00:01:46,103
LIKE KIM'S ALLEGED MORALITY

76
00:01:46,103 --> 00:01:46,837
FEAR OF FLYING.

77
00:01:46,837 --> 00:01:48,806
>> WE KNOW THAT THERE ARE

78
00:01:48,806 --> 00:01:49,607
LOGISTICAL ISSUES FOR THE

79
00:01:49,607 --> 00:01:50,841
NORTH KOREANS.

80
00:01:50,841 --> 00:01:51,909
FOR INSTANCE, GETTING KIM

81
00:01:51,909 --> 00:01:54,245
ALL THE WAY DOWN TO

82
00:01:54,245 --> 00:01:54,612
SINGAPORE.

83
00:01:54,612 --> 00:01:56,147
>> EXPERTS CAUTION THAT NO

84
00:01:56,147 --> 00:01:57,381
MATTER HOW POSITIVE TEAM

85
00:01:57,381 --> 00:01:59,016
TRUMP SOUNDS, THE ROAD TO A

86
00:01:59,016 --> 00:02:00,651
NUCLEAR DEAL IS STEEP AND

87
00:02:00,651 --> 00:02:01,919
PAVED WITH POTHOLES.

88
00:02:01,919 --> 00:02:03,187
YESTERDAY WAS A STARK

89
00:02:03,187 --> 00:02:04,989
REMINDER THAT SEVEN DECADES

90
00:02:04,989 --> 00:00:00,000
OF MISTRUST UNDERWRITE THE
