really that excited I guess I mean

3
00:00:05,310 --> 00:00:07,379
assuming that it will probably be like

00:00:07,379 --> 00:00:09,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">really expensive you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know I'm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not gonna</font>

5
00:00:09,570 --> 00:00:12,210
get any way and you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> just really the</font>

6
00:00:12,210 --> 00:00:14,070
seeing stuff you see on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> screen</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font>

7
00:00:14,070 --> 00:00:16,770
all around you I wouldn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> want people</font>

I've never<font color="#E5E5E5"> tried it before but like it</font>

10
00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:23,820
seems like it'd be really cool but<font color="#CCCCCC"> also</font>

11
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:26,699
I don't know it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> there something like</font>

12
00:00:26,699 --> 00:00:29,429
weird<font color="#CCCCCC"> about it like to advanced</font>

13
00:00:29,429 --> 00:00:32,579
technology to enhance<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok ha Jan there's</font>

14
00:00:32,579 --> 00:00:34,079
just like like regular screen so you

15
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:35,610
could<font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> watch the fun and like</font>

16
00:00:35,610 --> 00:00:37,559
there's like movie theaters were like

17
00:00:37,559 --> 00:00:40,079
the whole movie theater is filled with

18
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:42,450
like the screen and like what's on it

19
00:00:42,450 --> 00:00:44,640
virtual reality it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> just like I'm like</font>

20
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:46,710
a lot more expensive way I'm doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> what</font>

21
00:00:46,710 --> 00:00:48,239
<font color="#CCCCCC">you doing at the movie theater alright</font>

22
00:00:48,239 --> 00:00:50,520
but she said I<font color="#CCCCCC"> just think that sometimes</font>

23
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:54,059
it could be something companies can be a

24
00:00:54,059 --> 00:00:56,789
little too innovative like it could be a

25
00:00:56,789 --> 00:01:00,420
little<font color="#E5E5E5"> slow</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> down and like things could</font>

26
00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:03,239
try to get too far before it<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually</font>

27
00:01:03,239 --> 00:01:05,610
like people actually get accustomed to

28
00:01:05,610 --> 00:00:00,000
