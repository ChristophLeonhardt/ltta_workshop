00:00:04,791 --> 00:00:05,157

THIS MORNING, TO GO OF THEM WERE

10
00:00:17,837 --> 00:00:20,773

DESCRIBED CHRISTINE MALLOZZI

12
00:00:21,708 --> 00:00:23,909
FORD IN THAT RALLY IN

13
00:00:23,910 --> 00:00:25,044
MISSISSIPPI.

14
00:00:25,045 --> 00:00:31,350
KNOWING HOW SENSITIVE THIS IS,

15
00:00:31,351 --> 00:00:33,986
THESE PEOPLE NEED TO BE

16
00:00:33,987 --> 00:00:35,521
COMFORTABLE WITH VOTING FOR HIM.

17
00:00:35,522 --> 00:00:36,956
WHY DID THE PRESIDENT SAY WHAT

18
00:00:36,957 --> 00:00:39,325
HE DID IN THE WAY THAT HE SAID

19
00:00:39,326 --> 00:00:40,759
IT?

20
00:00:40,760 --> 00:00:41,660
>> Secretary Sanders: THE

21
00:00:41,661 --> 00:00:43,762
PRESIDENT WAS STATING THE FACTS,

22
00:00:43,763 --> 00:00:45,030
THE FACTS THAT WERE INCLUDED IN

23
00:00:45,031 --> 00:00:45,731
RACHEL MITCHELL'S REPORT.

24
00:00:45,732 --> 00:00:47,199
HE WAS STATING FACTS THAT WERE

25
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:49,135
GIVEN DURING DR. FORD'S

26
00:00:49,136 --> 00:00:50,269
TESTIMONY AND THE SENATE HAS TO

27
00:00:50,270 --> 00:00:52,638
MAKE A DECISION BASED ON THOSE

28
00:00:52,639 --> 00:00:53,372
FACTS.

29
00:00:53,373 --> 00:00:54,807
AND WHETHER OR NOT THEY SEE

30
00:00:54,808 --> 00:00:56,942
JUDGE KAVANAUGH TO BE QUALIFIED

31
00:00:56,943 --> 00:00:59,545
TO HOLD THE POSITION ON THE

32
00:00:59,546 --> 00:01:00,179
SUPREME COURT.

33
00:01:00,180 --> 00:01:00,813
EVERY SINGLE WORD JUDGE

34
00:01:00,814 --> 00:01:01,547
KAVANAUGH HAS SAID HAS BEEN

35
00:01:01,548 --> 00:01:03,983
PICKED APART.

36
00:01:03,984 --> 00:01:05,818
SECOND BY SECOND OF HIS

37
00:01:05,819 --> 00:01:06,919
TESTIMONY HAS BEEN PICKED APART

38
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:08,888
YET IF ANYBODY SAYS ANYTHING

39
00:01:08,889 --> 00:01:10,589
ABOUT THE ACCUSATIONS THAT HAVE

40
00:01:10,590 --> 00:01:12,792
BEEN THROWN AGAINST HIM, THAT IS

41
00:01:12,793 --> 00:01:14,160
TOTALLY OFF LIMITS AND

42
00:01:14,161 --> 00:01:14,560
OUTRAGEOUS.

43
00:01:14,561 --> 00:01:15,561
THIS ENTIRE PROCESS HAS BEEN A

44
00:01:15,562 --> 00:01:17,596
DISGRACE AND THE ONLY REASON

45
00:01:17,597 --> 00:01:19,098
IT'S BEEN THAT WAY IS BECAUSE

46
00:01:19,099 --> 00:01:20,399
SENATE DEMOCRATS DIDN'T DO THIS

47
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:22,735
THE WAY IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN DONE

48
00:01:22,736 --> 00:01:24,804
AND THEY CIRCUMVENTED THE ENTIRE

49
00:01:24,805 --> 00:01:25,972
SYSTEM AND UNDERMINED OUR ENTIRE

50
00:01:25,973 --> 00:01:27,440
JUDICIAL BRANCH BY THE WAY

51
00:01:27,441 --> 00:01:29,442
THEY'VE ACTED IN THE

52
00:01:29,443 --> 00:01:30,076
INAPPROPRIATE WAY THEY'VE

53
00:01:30,077 --> 00:01:33,346
CONDUCTED THEMSELVES.

AS THE PRESIDENT CONCERNED HE
