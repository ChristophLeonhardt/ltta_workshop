marble the disturbing images of small children being torn from their parents were troubling enough to push the President to act but nobody really expected that it could get worse last night it did according to the Associated Press Trump administration officials are sending babies as well as small children to what are called tender age shelters in South Texas lawyers and medical providers who spoke to The Associated Press described scenes of play rooms of crying preschool aged children in crisis and while they insisted facilities are safe they add that the small children have no idea where their parents are in our hysterical crying and acting out four days ago homeland security officials told reporters quote we are not separating babies from parents we now know that's not true the Detroit Free Press is reporting the two baby boys aged eight months and 11 months were shipped to Grand Rapids Michigan in the middle of the night we're also hearing stories of children being sent as far as Kansas or even New York City up to Harlem where New York one shot this video of five young girls being escorted to a foster Center after being separated from their parent there those kids are 100 woman told The New Yorker magazine that she has not seen her five-year-old son in nearly six weeks and is extremely worried that she might be deported without him well given the president's new executive order of late today it's unclear what happens to the children already separated thousands of them already separated from their parents from where I'm from NBC's Jacob Soboroff was at McAllen Texas father John Jenkins president of the University of Notre Dame and Christina fiallo co-executive director of freedom for immigrants wellhow I'm glad that all three of you taken firstly the facts of this story of those thousands of kids already torn from their parents including kids that are best at the tender age level are they going to get back to their parents anytime soon or at all we don't know Chris and I just got off the phone actually with an official from HHS the agency that has been responsible for housing these children that have been separated from their parents once they leave the custody of the Border Patrol and they tell me that ultimately whether or not those twenty five hundred or so kids they have been from their parents down here on the southern border end up back with their parents a grandfathered essentially under this executive order is up to the Department of Homeland Security I reached out to the Department of Homeland Security tonight we still don't have an answer and that also leaves all of these children in limbo I got to remind you we still have not seen we know about those three tender-age shelters but we still have not actually had our eyes on the girls that are detained and the toddlers and the infants that are detained and we continue to ask to see them because despite the fact that the kids moving forward will be detained with their families whether or not it's a nice detention or some sort of other detention center maybe even indefinitely we don't know what happens to these 25 just to be simple we don't start it retroactively we know exactly the water turn will you stay there we don't go to father Jenkins because father Jenkins you hold a seat which is treasured in our country in terms of human rights going back to Theodore Hesburgh on the Civil Rights Commission I one of you on the show tonight because I want it before we know what Trump was up to this EFT and I want to know what people like yourself in the clergy and the nakid dent academics think about this moment in history because I think it is a moment our history and it's not a good one well I agree Chris it is a moral outrage that you're seeing across the political spectrum at this and the reason is the families are so central to what holds us together as human beings say john paul ii call them the fundamental building blocks of society and when the state intervenes to tear families apart it's it's intervening at what is really at the heart of our values and this is never what America is to occur it's never been who we are as Americans and I I think that's why you're seeing such outrage at this this practice of separating parents from children what do you say to those who support the president generally on on immigration issues who are sort of hardliners in this case well look we need secure borders everyone agrees with that what worries me is the rhetoric demeans these people I mean to talk about them as rapists and criminals it just isn't true most of them are our people looking for a better life for their families now I'm not saying that we shouldn't have border security we should but treat these people as human beings don't treat them as animals or someone that's that we can take their rights away that's what I think people are saying again you could think what you want about immigration reform but the starting point should be treat these people with decency and treat these families with decency thank you Father let me go to Cristina on this Kristen fiala you know what father just touched on it's a very bad point our history for hundreds of years the white people of this country just to be ethnic about it for a moment separated black people from their families that was what slavery was all about people each having a each person having a price on their head basically you could sell people and separate them for money and that went on for hundreds of years in this country this was not a one-week thing like this thing but this sort of goes back to that the willingness for national policy to separate and break up families is now on the head of this country and those who support the government that is correct Chris the Trump administration's executive order to stop the separation of families but to put them into family immigration detention facilities is not the solution My organization freedom for immigrants has been visiting and monitoring immigration detention facilities for a decade including family detention facilities and we know what happens inside of there it's awful we released a report last year that found widespread sexual and physical assault and immigration detention facilities including a young girl under 18 who filed a claim the current detention facility a family detention facility in Texas about sexual assaults a medical examination showed vaginal scarring and an STD I know the American public really wants to see an immediate solution to this brutal reality that we're living in but family immigration detention is not the solution we need to abolish the immigration detention system and create true community alternatives to detention thank you we talked to her about that you have so much information on that I hope everybody gets it eventually in honor of World Refugee day former President Barack I'm waiting on the Trump administration policy today of separating families in a Facebook post former President Obama wrote to be an American is to have a shared commitment to an ideal that all of us are created equal and all of us deserves a chance to become our parents and grandparents and generations before created for us and it's something we have to protect for the generations to come but we have to do more than say this isn't who we are we have to prove it through our policies our laws our actions and our votes let me go back to Jacob on that just to get back to you just to seal this off you don't know we don't know nobody knows what's gonna happen to the two thousand kids that some of them sent up to New York some said the Michigan their parents have no idea where they are and some of the parents were lied to I was reading today that some parents were told oh you'll see your kid in a couple days yeah there it could be in seventeen states in a hundred different shelters Christmas I just wanna go back to what President Obama said there because if the words are inspiring but to echo the point that we just heard President Obama and his administration operated in open shelters just like the ones that we got to look into just this past week the ones with the cages and the mats and the mylar blankets if you were displeased disgusted by seeing children alone in them that's a policy that dates back not just not the children but the detention center itself administration's before this one so when it comes to immigration if you feel like you want to change after what you've seen it's not just about children being detained alone but how all immigrants are detained when they come into this country illegally this debates going to go on and on and it's human now and we've seen the human face of it like we never thought we'd see I thank you so much Jacob of course from McAllen Texas Jacob Soboroff and thank you Father John Jenkins of Holy Ghost a Holy Cross that's my school from Notre Dame thanking university of notre dame
