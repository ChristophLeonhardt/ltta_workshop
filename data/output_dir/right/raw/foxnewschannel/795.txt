1
00:00:02,675 --> 00:00:06,045
THEY SET UP $25,000 TO COVER

2
00:00:06,045 --> 00:00:07,746
THOSE COSTS.

3
00:00:07,746 --> 00:00:10,649
ROB: ANGELA MERKEL IN MIDST OF

4
00:00:10,649 --> 00:00:11,650
OPEN-BORDER CRISIS THAT COULD

5
00:00:11,650 --> 00:00:13,385
PUT HER OUT OF A JOB AND THAT'S

6
00:00:13,385 --> 00:00:14,753
EXACTLY WHAT PRESIDENT TRUMP IS

7
00:00:14,753 --> 00:00:15,854
TRYING TO STOP FROM HAPPENING

8
00:00:15,854 --> 00:00:18,257
HERE IN THE UNITED STATES.

9
00:00:18,257 --> 00:00:20,259
>> WE HAVE NO WALL, WE HAVE NO

10
00:00:20,259 --> 00:00:22,394
BORDER SECURITY.

11
00:00:22,394 --> 00:00:24,563
WITHOUT A BORDER, YOU DON'T HAVE

12
00:00:24,563 --> 00:00:25,130
A COUNTRY.

13
00:00:25,130 --> 00:00:26,999
YOU DON'T HAVE A COUNTRY.

14
00:00:26,999 --> 00:00:29,134
ROB: BUT WITH A RECORD-NUMBER OF

15
00:00:29,134 --> 00:00:31,003
ASYLUM SEEKERS ON AMERICA'S

16
00:00:31,003 --> 00:00:32,171
DOORSTEP, WHAT NEEDS TO BE DONE

17
00:00:32,171 --> 00:00:34,606
TO STRENGTHEN THE BORDER?

18
00:00:34,606 --> 00:00:36,108
JILLIAN: IS THE PRESIDENT'S TOP

19
00:00:36,108 --> 00:00:38,777
APPROACH WILL SAVE AS THE SAME

20
00:00:38,777 --> 00:00:41,313
FATE AS GERMANY.

21
00:00:41,313 --> 00:00:43,082
JOINING US RIGHT NOW NIGHAL

22
00:00:43,082 --> 00:00:44,283
FARAGE, JOINING US LIVE HERE IN

00:00:44,283 --> 00:00:45,284
THE STUDIO.

24
00:00:45,284 --> 00:00:45,985
>> GOOD MORNING.

25
00:00:45,985 --> 00:00:47,886
JILLIAN: SO NICE TO SEE YOU THIS

26
00:00:47,886 --> 00:00:48,220
MORNING.

27
00:00:48,220 --> 00:00:49,021
WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT WHAT'S

28
00:00:49,021 --> 00:00:50,923
HAPPENING IN GERMANY?

29
00:00:50,923 --> 00:00:52,691
>> YOU KNOW, SHE WAS THE MOST

30
00:00:52,691 --> 00:00:54,360
POWERFUL EUROPEAN LEADER, BEEN

31
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:56,362
IN POWER OVER DECADE, DOMINANT

32
00:00:56,362 --> 00:00:59,531
FIGURE NOT JUST IN GERMANY BUT

33
00:00:59,531 --> 00:01:00,899
EUROPEAN UNION, ONE DECISION HAS

34
00:01:00,899 --> 00:01:03,235
COMPLETELY RUINED HER CAREER AND

35
00:01:03,235 --> 00:01:05,236
LEGACY AND I THINK IT WAS THE

36
00:01:05,236 --> 00:01:07,206
WORST DECISION ANY WESTERN

37
00:01:07,206 --> 00:01:07,639
LEADER.

38
00:01:07,639 --> 00:01:09,208
AS MANY OF YOU WANT TO COME, CAN

39
00:01:09,208 --> 00:01:10,542
COME, OVER A MILLION PEOPLE CAME

40
00:01:10,542 --> 00:01:11,377
TO GERMANY.

41
00:01:11,377 --> 00:01:13,012
WE HAVE NOW SEEN IN THE LAST 4

42
00:01:13,012 --> 00:01:15,047
YEARS OVER A THOUSAND PEOPLE IN

43
00:01:15,047 --> 00:01:21,453
EUROPE KILLED OR MAINED BY

44
00:01:21,453 --> 00:01:21,820
REFUGEES.

45
00:01:21,820 --> 00:01:24,790
A NEW PARTY IN GERMANY EMERGED,

46
00:01:24,790 --> 00:01:28,160
IT'S GETTING NEAR 20% OF POLLS

47
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:29,828
AND PUT ABSOLUTELY FEAR OF GOD

48
00:01:29,828 --> 00:01:30,896
INTO THE ESTABLISHMENT.

49
00:01:30,896 --> 00:01:32,831
SHE'S GOT TWO WEEKS TO TRY AND

50
00:01:32,831 --> 00:01:35,034
CONVINCE THE EUROPEAN UNION TO

51
00:01:35,034 --> 00:01:36,568
CHANGE DIRECTION BUT IT'S A BIT

52
00:01:36,568 --> 00:01:39,304
RICH, ISN'T IT, FOR THE PERSON

53
00:01:39,304 --> 00:01:40,806
WHO OPEN THE DOOR AND TO SAY

54
00:01:40,806 --> 00:01:43,008
IT'S TIME TO GET TOUGH.

55
00:01:43,008 --> 00:01:44,076
SHE'S FINISHED.

56
00:01:44,076 --> 00:01:46,612
ROB: THE PRESIDENT SAYS GERMANY

57
00:01:46,612 --> 00:01:48,947
HAS HIGH-CRIME RATE THAT GOES

58
00:01:48,947 --> 00:01:52,151
UP, HE GETS LOM PASTED BUT IF

59
00:01:52,151 --> 00:01:57,189
YOU LOOK AT THE NUMBERS,

60
00:01:57,189 --> 00:01:58,123
2015-2016, WHEN ALL THIS BECAME

61
00:01:58,123 --> 00:01:59,324
A PROBLEM, THE VIOLENT CRIME

62
00:01:59,324 --> 00:02:01,160
RATE WENT UP SOMETHING LIKE 10%

63
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:02,294
OF GERMANY.

64
00:02:02,294 --> 00:02:11,002
>> OH, YEAH.

65
00:02:11,002 --> 00:02:14,440
>> DON'T FORGET CRIMES AGAINST

66
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:15,040
WOMEN.

67
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:16,809
REFUGEES, YOUNG MALES UNDER THE

68
00:02:16,809 --> 00:02:18,577
AGE OF 30, THEY COME FROM

69
00:02:18,577 --> 00:02:21,246
CULTURES IN WHICH WOMEN AREN'T

70
00:02:21,246 --> 00:02:21,814
SECOND-CLASS CITIZENS.

71
00:02:21,814 --> 00:02:24,383
IS ANYONE SURPRISED?

72
00:02:24,383 --> 00:02:26,318
THE HUGE RISE IN SEXUAL CRIME.

73
00:02:26,318 --> 00:02:28,587
LOOK, IMMIGRATION LED TO BREXIT

74
00:02:28,587 --> 00:02:30,322
VOTE, IMMIGRATION LED TO NEW

75
00:02:30,322 --> 00:02:31,723
ITALIAN GOVERNMENT, IMMIGRATION

76
00:02:31,723 --> 00:02:33,525
WILL FINISH OFF ANGELA MERKEL

77
00:02:33,525 --> 00:02:34,460
AND PRESIDENT TRUMP WAS ELECTED

78
00:02:34,460 --> 00:02:36,428
ON A VERY TOUGH TICKET OF

79
00:02:36,428 --> 00:02:37,863
DEALING WITH ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION

80
00:02:37,863 --> 00:02:39,798
AND NOW YOU'VE GOT THE LIBERAL

81
00:02:39,798 --> 00:02:41,967
MEDIA SCREAMING AT EVERYTHING HE

82
00:02:41,967 --> 00:02:43,802
DOES, BUT THE ONE THING IS FOR

83
00:02:43,802 --> 00:02:46,071
CERTAIN IF TRUMP IS NOT HOLD

84
00:02:46,071 --> 00:02:47,940
TRUE AND REALLY TIGHTEN

85
00:02:47,940 --> 00:02:48,841
IMMIGRATION, MANY OF THOSE

86
00:02:48,841 --> 00:02:50,209
PEOPLE WHO CAME OUT AND VOTED

87
00:02:50,209 --> 00:02:52,111
FOR HIM WON'T DO IT FOR HIM.

88
00:02:52,111 --> 00:02:54,279
IT'S A KEY ISSUE HERE TOO.

89
00:02:54,279 --> 00:02:57,716
JILLIAN: THERE'S BEEN 27%

90
00:02:57,716 --> 00:02:59,084
INCREASE IN ASIGH RUM SEEKERS

91
00:02:59,084 --> 00:03:00,486
JUST IN 2017.

92
00:03:00,486 --> 00:03:01,820
YOU MENTIONED PRESIDENT TRUMP

93
00:03:01,820 --> 00:03:03,222
AND TOUGH STANCE, YOU ALSO SEE

94
00:03:03,222 --> 00:03:08,260
THE OTHER SIDE OF THIS HOUSE,

95
00:03:08,260 --> 00:03:09,628
THIS WEEK RAMPED UP ABOUT WHAT'S

96
00:03:09,628 --> 00:03:11,763
GOING ON IN THE BORDER,

97
00:03:11,763 --> 00:03:13,832
SEPARATION OF FAMILIES, WHAT DO

98
00:03:13,832 --> 00:03:15,901
YOU THINK THE UNITED STATES CAN

99
00:03:16,034 --> 00:03:20,038
GERMANY AND WHAT WE CAN DO GOING

100
00:03:20,038 --> 00:03:21,039
FORWARD?

101
00:03:21,039 --> 00:03:22,007
>> IT TURNED OUT MANY OF THOSE

102
00:03:22,007 --> 00:03:24,643
WHO WERE CALLED CHILDREN WERE IN

103
00:03:24,643 --> 00:03:25,577
FACT, OVER 18.

104
00:03:25,577 --> 00:03:27,980
UP WITH OF THEM TRIED TO BLOW UP

105
00:03:27,980 --> 00:03:29,047
LONDON SUBWAY.

106
00:03:29,047 --> 00:03:31,650
SO IT'S VERY EASY TO BE

107
00:03:31,650 --> 00:03:32,885
COMPASSIONATE BUT YOU HAVE TO

108
00:03:32,885 --> 00:03:33,819
UNDERSTAND IN THE CASE OF

109
00:03:33,819 --> 00:03:35,187
AMERICA AND BORDERS, MANY OF THE

110
00:03:35,187 --> 00:03:38,524
CHILDREN ARE BEING USED AS MEANS

111
00:03:38,524 --> 00:03:40,993
TO GET OTHER PEOPLE IN, MANY WHO

112
00:03:40,993 --> 00:03:42,461
AREN'T EVEN FAMILIES.

113
00:03:42,461 --> 00:03:44,663
YOU'VE GOT TO, TRUMP HAS GOT TO

114
00:03:44,663 --> 00:03:46,365
STAY TOUGH ON THIS AND IGNORE

115
00:03:46,365 --> 00:03:48,333
ALL THE SCREAMS COMING FROM THE

116
00:03:48,333 --> 00:03:49,034
LIBERAL MEDIA.

117
00:03:49,034 --> 00:03:51,737
ROB: IS THE TOUGH PART BEING

118
00:03:51,737 --> 00:03:55,073
PRAGMATIC WHILE NOT APPEARING TO

119
00:03:55,073 --> 00:03:58,110
BE SOLE ES, WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE

120
00:03:58,110 --> 00:04:01,613
NUMBERS, THIS IS BEING ABUSED AS

121
00:04:01,613 --> 00:04:02,481
RECORD BREAK.

122
00:04:02,481 --> 00:04:03,448
THIS IS NOW A THOUSAND PERCENT

123
00:04:03,448 --> 00:04:07,619
MORE PEOPLE THAT NEED ASYLUM.

124
00:04:07,619 --> 00:04:09,421
THIS IS THE LOOPHOLE AND THEY

125
00:04:09,421 --> 00:04:10,956
ARE BEING TOLD WHAT TO DO AND

126
00:04:10,956 --> 00:04:12,724
COACHED HOW TO DO IT AND HERE

127
00:04:12,724 --> 00:04:14,393
THEY ARE.

128
00:04:14,393 --> 00:04:15,961
>> IT'S VERY IMPRESSIVE.

129
00:04:15,961 --> 00:04:17,930
ONE THING HE HASN'T DONE YET, HE

130
00:04:17,930 --> 00:04:18,730
HASN'T BUILD THE WALL, MAYBE

131
00:04:18,730 --> 00:04:21,033
IT'S TIME HE STARTS IT.

132
00:04:21,033 --> 00:04:22,734
ROB: THEY ARE TRYING TO MAKE

133
00:04:22,734 --> 00:04:23,936
SOME PROGRESS ON THAT.

134
00:04:23,936 --> 00:04:25,337
HE'S TRYING TO GET THE FUNDING,

135
00:04:25,337 --> 00:04:26,672
THAT'S THE HARD PART.

136
00:04:26,672 --> 00:04:28,373
>> THAT'S THE HARD PART AND

137
00:04:28,373 --> 00:04:29,041
OBVIOUSLY CONGRESS.

138
00:04:29,041 --> 00:04:31,610
HE HAS TO GET THIS THROUGH, HE

139
00:04:31,610 --> 00:04:33,278
NEEDS TALKING TOUGH IS ONE THING

140
00:04:33,278 --> 00:00:00,000
BUT DELIVERING IS WHAT REALLY
