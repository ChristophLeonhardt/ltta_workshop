what is the extensible policy reason for these changes to Canada's firearms law in the first place well I don't think there is a valid policy reason for making these changes I think what we're really seeing here is an attempt to bait and switch and distract from an ineffective government with an ineffective leader who goes around the world on vacation dressing as a Bollywood star with the aim of him embarrassing himself in this country this this firearms control regime that the Liberals have created is nothing less than an attempt to undo some of the positive things that were done in the previous government and it really does a few other much more mischievous things such as setting up a de facto registry which is merely paid for by the private sector indeed and you know Sheldon tell me if I've got this right because I've gone through the components of Bill c71 and I can't for the life of me think how implementing any of this stuff makes Canadians safer when it comes to the vast majority of gun crimes which are criminals gangbangers using guns in the vast majority of cases that were never registered in the first place so this is really going after legal gun owners and just making their lives miserable with more bureaucratic red tape well I quite agree with you David this does make things more onerous for the law abiding for example the new restrictions on authorizations to transport have nothing whatsoever to do with stopping gang bangers from sticking up 711s or engaging in violence against rivals what this does is merely limit the ability of law-abiding citizens you want to go to take their firearms to a gunsmith or to a gun show or display or and or 200 to arrange and maybe have stop and get a bag of cheesie's on the way it does really nothing whatsoever to do with stopping real crime this is a bait and switch on a bit of legislation and we're going to work very hard to make sure that the next government repeals this and does much more in the name of firearms law reform the laws of a as they exist now are onerous draconian and unnecessary and they need to be repealed that's an excerpt from my daily TV show the Ezra Levante show normally it's behind a paywall but I thought you'd like this video so we put it on YouTube if you want to subscribe to watch the daily show every day including always two interviews today and I read my hate mail just click on this screen and become a Premium Member you
