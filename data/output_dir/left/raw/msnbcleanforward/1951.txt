CONSPIRING ON MAKING A PAYMENT AND I’M HEARING MICHAEL COHEN

I SAW THIS INTERVIEW THAT LANNY JUST GAVE AT CNN.

18
00:00:32,465 --> 00:00:34,024
JUST GAVE AT CNN. I BELIEVE LANNY’S A VERY GOOD

00:00:34,034 --> 00:00:34,358
I BELIEVE LANNY’S A VERY GOOD LAWYER.

20
00:00:34,401 --> 00:00:35,792
LAWYER. I LIKE LANNY.

21
00:00:35,802 --> 00:00:37,127
I LIKE LANNY. BUT THAT WAS QUITE A MARVELOUS

22
00:00:37,137 --> 00:00:39,930
BUT THAT WAS QUITE A MARVELOUS PERFORMANCE THAT HE JUST GAVE

23
00:00:39,940 --> 00:00:41,832
PERFORMANCE THAT HE JUST GAVE OVER ON CNN TRYING TO PAINT

24
00:00:41,875 --> 00:00:43,433
OVER ON CNN TRYING TO PAINT MICHAEL COHEN, WHO’S AN ABSOLUTE

CRIMINAL THUG, AS A VICTIM AND AS ANYTHING OTHER THAN WHAT HE

AS ANYTHING OTHER THAN WHAT HE IS, LAWRENCE.

28
00:00:50,751 --> 00:00:51,742
IS, LAWRENCE. HE’S A CO-CONSPIRATOR.

29
00:00:51,752 --> 00:00:53,744
HE’S A CO-CONSPIRATOR. THEY’RE TRYING TO CONVINCE THE

30
00:00:53,754 --> 00:00:54,645
THEY’RE TRYING TO CONVINCE THE AMERICAN PUBLIC OF SOMETHING

31
00:00:54,655 --> 00:00:56,747
AMERICAN PUBLIC OF SOMETHING THAT JUST IS NOT ACCURATE.

32
00:00:56,757 --> 00:00:58,482
THAT JUST IS NOT ACCURATE. LOOK, MICHAEL COHEN COULD COME

AROUND THIS DISCUSSION, AND WE COULD DISPENSE WITH ANY DEBATE

38
00:01:09,403 --> 00:01:11,094
COULD DISPENSE WITH ANY DEBATE ABOUT WHO SAID CASH OR WHO

00:01:11,138 --> 00:01:12,329
ABOUT WHO SAID CASH OR WHO DIDN’T SAY CASH OR WHAT DID THEY

AND THEY SPRINKLE OUT THIS MORSEL, THIS ONE-MINUTE TAPE.

68
00:01:56,784 --> 00:01:58,009
MORSEL, THIS ONE-MINUTE TAPE. THERE’S MULTIPLE TAPES.

69
00:01:58,019 --> 00:01:59,510
THERE’S MULTIPLE TAPES. THERE’S OVER A DOZEN TAPES,

LANNY DAVIS IS TRYING TO CURRY FAVOR WITH THE AMERICAN PEOPLE

MIDDLE OF THIS VERY DARK FOREST AND LEAD MICHAEL COHEN TO

82
00:02:17,205 --> 00:02:17,528
AND LEAD MICHAEL COHEN TO SALVATION.

83
00:02:17,572 --> 00:02:21,032
SALVATION. >> I THINK THERE’S SOMETHING ON

84
00:02:21,042 --> 00:02:21,966
>> I THINK THERE’S SOMETHING ON THIS TAPE THAT CLARIFIES

85
00:02:22,009 --> 00:02:23,134
THIS TAPE THAT CLARIFIES SOMETHING ABOUT WHY IT’S PUBLIC.

86
00:02:23,177 --> 00:02:24,435
SOMETHING ABOUT WHY IT’S PUBLIC. THERE’S BEEN SOME DISCUSSION

87
00:02:24,445 --> 00:02:27,738
THERE’S BEEN SOME DISCUSSION PRIOR TO US HEARING THIS TAPE

88
00:02:27,749 --> 00:02:29,741
PRIOR TO US HEARING THIS TAPE THAT DONALD TRUMP STRANGELY DID

89
00:02:29,751 --> 00:02:31,576
THAT DONALD TRUMP STRANGELY DID NOT CLAIM ATTORNEY-CLIENT

90
00:02:31,619 --> 00:02:33,244
NOT CLAIM ATTORNEY-CLIENT PRIVILEGE, JUST WAIVED

91
00:02:33,254 --> 00:02:33,945
PRIVILEGE, JUST WAIVED ATTORNEY-CLIENT PRIVILEGE FOR

92
00:02:33,988 --> 00:02:35,346
ATTORNEY-CLIENT PRIVILEGE FOR THIS KIND OF RECORDING.

93
00:02:35,356 --> 00:02:38,149
THIS KIND OF RECORDING. BUT THERE IS NO ATTORNEY-CLIENT

94
00:02:38,159 --> 00:02:40,084
BUT THERE IS NO ATTORNEY-CLIENT PRIVILEGE IF THIRD PARTIES ARE

95
00:02:40,128 --> 00:02:41,452
PRIVILEGE IF THIRD PARTIES ARE IN THE ROOM.

96
00:02:41,463 --> 00:02:43,020
IN THE ROOM. AND DONALD TRUMP ASKS FOR A

97
00:02:43,031 --> 00:02:44,155
AND DONALD TRUMP ASKS FOR A COCA-COLA AT A CERTAIN POINT.

98
00:02:44,199 --> 00:02:46,624
COCA-COLA AT A CERTAIN POINT. SOMEONE COULD HAVE WALKED IN THE

99
00:02:46,668 --> 00:02:48,226
SOMEONE COULD HAVE WALKED IN THE ROOM AND SERVED HIM THAT.

100
00:02:48,236 --> 00:02:51,830
ROOM AND SERVED HIM THAT. THAT BREAKS THE ATTORNEY-CLIENT

101
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:52,163
THAT BREAKS THE ATTORNEY-CLIENT PRIVILEGE.

102
00:02:52,207 --> 00:02:53,264
PRIVILEGE. WE HEAR A VOICE IN THE ROOM AT

103
00:02:53,274 --> 00:02:54,398
WE HEAR A VOICE IN THE ROOM AT THE BEGINNING OF THE MICHAEL

104
00:02:54,442 --> 00:02:55,633
THE BEGINNING OF THE MICHAEL COHEN CONVERSATION WITH DONALD

105
00:02:55,643 --> 00:02:55,933
COHEN CONVERSATION WITH DONALD TRUMP.

106
00:02:55,944 --> 00:02:59,871
TRUMP. SO THIS CONVERSATION MIGHT NEVER

107
00:02:59,915 --> 00:03:01,005
SO THIS CONVERSATION MIGHT NEVER HAVE BEEN PROTECTED BY THE

108
00:03:01,049 --> 00:03:01,373
HAVE BEEN PROTECTED BY THE PRIVILEGE.

109
00:03:01,416 --> 00:03:02,541
PRIVILEGE. >> WELL, I ACTUALLY THINK THAT

110
00:03:02,584 --> 00:03:03,775
>> WELL, I ACTUALLY THINK THAT IT PROBABLY WAS PROTECTED BY THE

111
00:03:03,819 --> 00:03:04,909
IT PROBABLY WAS PROTECTED BY THE PRIVILEGE EVEN IF THERE WAS

112
00:03:04,953 --> 00:03:05,877
PRIVILEGE EVEN IF THERE WAS ANOTHER MEMBER OF THE STAFF OR

113
00:03:05,921 --> 00:03:06,711
ANOTHER MEMBER OF THE STAFF OR SOMEONE ELSE THAT WOULD HAVE

114
00:03:06,755 --> 00:03:08,880
SOMEONE ELSE THAT WOULD HAVE ENTERED THE ROOM.

115
00:03:08,890 --> 00:03:10,181
ENTERED THE ROOM. THAT WOULD NOT VITIATE THE

116
00:03:10,225 --> 00:03:10,548
THAT WOULD NOT VITIATE THE PRIVILEGE.

117
00:03:10,592 --> 00:03:12,183
PRIVILEGE. I THINK THERE WAS A QUESTION AS

118
00:03:12,227 --> 00:03:14,018
I THINK THERE WAS A QUESTION AS TO WHETHER THERE WAS EVER AN

119
00:03:14,062 --> 00:03:14,686
TO WHETHER THERE WAS EVER AN ATTORNEY-CLIENT PRIVILEGE

120
00:03:14,696 --> 00:03:15,387
ATTORNEY-CLIENT PRIVILEGE SURROUNDING THIS CONVERSATION

121
00:03:15,397 --> 00:03:16,288
SURROUNDING THIS CONVERSATION BECAUSE I DON’T THINK MICHAEL

122
00:03:16,298 --> 00:03:20,292
BECAUSE I DON’T THINK MICHAEL COHEN IS ENGAGED IN PROVIDING

123
00:03:20,302 --> 00:03:25,997
COHEN IS ENGAGED IN PROVIDING LEGAL SERVICES TO MR. TRUMP

124
00:03:26,041 --> 00:03:26,598
LEGAL SERVICES TO MR. TRUMP UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES.

125
00:03:26,608 --> 00:03:27,299
UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES. I THINK THIS IS A STRETCH AT

126
00:03:27,309 --> 00:03:27,599
I THINK THIS IS A STRETCH AT BEST.

127
00:03:27,609 --> 00:03:28,533
BEST. I THINK THE WHITE HOUSE KNEW,

128
00:03:28,577 --> 00:03:30,101
I THINK THE WHITE HOUSE KNEW, RUDY SKRUL NI KNEW THAT

129
00:03:30,112 --> 00:03:31,002
RUDY SKRUL NI KNEW THAT EVENTUALLY THIS TAPE WAS GOING

130
00:03:31,045 --> 00:03:32,470
EVENTUALLY THIS TAPE WAS GOING TO COME OUT, AND SO THEY DECIDED

131
00:03:32,514 --> 00:03:35,373
TO COME OUT, AND SO THEY DECIDED NOT TO PRESS FORWARD ON THE

132
00:03:35,384 --> 00:03:35,707
NOT TO PRESS FORWARD ON THE PRIVILEGE.

133
00:03:35,750 --> 00:03:36,608
PRIVILEGE. BUT I FIND THIS VERY CURIOUS,

134
00:03:36,618 --> 00:03:39,811
BUT I FIND THIS VERY CURIOUS, THIS INTERVIEW THAT LANNY DAVIS

RIGHT NOW AS TO WHAT’S GOING ON HERE.

140
00:03:45,894 --> 00:03:46,718
HERE. MICHAEL COHEN COULD HAVE ISSUED

141
00:03:46,728 --> 00:03:47,719
MICHAEL COHEN COULD HAVE ISSUED A WRITTEN STATEMENT EVEN IF HE

142
00:03:47,729 --> 00:03:48,720
A WRITTEN STATEMENT EVEN IF HE DIDN’T WANT TO GO ON TELEVISION

ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED HERE. WHERE ARE THE REST OF THE TAPES?

WHERE ARE THE REST OF THE TAPES? WHERE’S THE REST OF THE

146
00:03:55,237 --> 00:03:55,594
WHERE’S THE REST OF THE EVIDENCE?

147
00:03:55,637 --> 00:03:56,628
EVIDENCE? YOU DON’T GET TO CLAIM LOVE OF

148
00:03:56,671 --> 00:03:57,696
YOU DON’T GET TO CLAIM LOVE OF COUNTRY AND BEING A PATRIOT

149
00:03:57,739 --> 00:03:58,530
COUNTRY AND BEING A PATRIOT UNLESS YOU DO THE RIGHT THING

150
00:03:58,573 --> 00:03:59,664
UNLESS YOU DO THE RIGHT THING AND HE’S NOT DOING THE RIGHT

151
00:03:59,708 --> 00:03:59,998
AND HE’S NOT DOING THE RIGHT THING.

152
00:04:00,008 --> 00:04:01,433
THING. >> WHAT DO YOU THINK THAT LANNY

00:04:08,650 --> 00:04:10,041
TO ACCOMPLISH? >> I THINK HE’S TRYING TO PUSH

159
00:04:10,052 --> 00:04:12,044
>> I THINK HE’S TRYING TO PUSH THE RESET BUTTON RELATING TO HIS

160
00:04:12,087 --> 00:04:16,615
THE RESET BUTTON RELATING TO HIS CLIENT’S REPUTATION.

161
00:04:16,658 --> 00:04:17,349
CLIENT’S REPUTATION. AMONG THE AMERICAN PEOPLE.

162
00:04:17,392 --> 00:04:18,717
AMONG THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. I THINK HE’S TRYING TO PAINT HIS

I THINK HE’S TRYING TO PAINT HIS CLIENT AS A VICTIM AND AS A GUY
