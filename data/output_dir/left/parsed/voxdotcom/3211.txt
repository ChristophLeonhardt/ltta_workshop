David Bowie's massive influence is a lot
wider than it can be catalogued but one
way is through samples and quotations
the highest-profile one would definitely
be vanilla ice that bassline famously
quotes under pressure by Bowie and Queen
though mr. ice also denied using Bowie's
song we battled Obama but it not blown
both whoa he eventually had to share
songwriting credits and a cut of the
royalties another big one is puff
daddy's been around the world
puffy sampled Bowie's biggest commercial
success the title track from 1983 s
let's dance but there are so so many
more less obvious ones star guitar from
The Chemical Brothers has a pretty
inventive sample from star man off Ziggy
Stardust
and Becks Deborah basically takes one
melody from win off Bowie's 1975 album
young Americans and stretches it into a
6-minute Hyundai name checking
masterpiece jay-z sampled him in the
take over Lady Gaga sampled the same
song the Nine Inch Nails sampled him
who've armata sampled him
hell even uncle sample town
and when he became famous he championed
lesser-known influences on him like Lou
Reed and Iggy Pop he continued this
throughout his life he helped the Arcade
Fire reach the masses when they were
coming up in 2003 beyond the myriad
artists he inspired his core message
could be yourself
no matter how weird how different from
everybody else that might be what
indoors most depends
you're not alone
