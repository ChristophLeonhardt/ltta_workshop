let me get to the point yeah the wait is
finally over
yes it's been a long time coming but you
are about to watch the season finale bad
man 10 and you know it's crazy because
every time I do these videos these
episodes I always leave a video message
talking about how tired I am and how
this is the hardest project I will
return in my life you know and it is and
today is no exception however and when I
read the comments and they'll always be
those killer 3 words that kill me make
it longer
I don't nothing like excuse me because
I'm like what last one was like maybe an
hour long I listen to you guys and you
know what because you guys you guys have
been so patient for what waiting I think
over six months for this episode I have
gone out of my way and I have made a
movie that's why this video is I think
an hour and 25 minutes long that's
that's that's movie time this is a movie
and this is for you guys so please
understand that this is probably the
craziest thing I've ever done in my life
would I do it again probably not but
it's for you guys so yeah I would and if
you haven't seen Batman 1 2 9 guys stop
what you're doing right now just stop
watch them go back and watch them and
then watch this video trust me you will
not be disappointed and all I want is
first of all to go onto it or and
hashtag bad man 10 and even if I get
seven of them I'll be happy and more
importantly the only thing I ask from

subscribe that's all I will just take
time out of your busy schedule before
this video starts and subscribe spread
the schiavo and Instagram hums of
production but just subscribe and

wanted to join because you you know I
killed your brother you know that I left
you to rot whilst I reaped the rewards
of your brother's doing so Tommy TJ why

house
excuse me I hope you know I'm a ladies
man I had to put no beards in my
Instagram I didn't work girls go missing
well I did my part okay
I don't want to be called Rebecca

people seem to think that Rebecca's a
girl's name I don't know why that's wild
to me
but to avoid confusion I just wanna be
caught by my nickname from now on
okay huh okay you mean like the letter K

actually working unbelief information I
was aware of prior to now right but they
are trying to kill me

the one made you listen why he got
yourself into all this yeah I think it
was him that gives it up it sure you
beat the shit out then you do it sure
you come home mother sister miss you
very much
you know
you
this was the moment when everything
changed the moment when two doors opened
and I chose the wrong one I entered a
world that brought me nothing but pain
and misery and from my retaliation I
created a new enemy a monster who took
everything away from me he turned my own
against me he hurt my cousin attacked my
sister killed the girl I loved and now
this so I approached someone who knew
where TJ was hiding out he didn't want
to tell me at first for my own safety
but he knew he had no choice it was
finally time to end it all
by the end of tonight
one of us who died
djay
Oh
I'm Han
are you going Batman speaking
for the rest of your life tomorrow next
week next year
always remember I beat the ship of you
twice
it was finally over and a new doll had
finally opened good I wanted to kill TJ
but I allowed to do the right thing and
I knew but he will spend the rest of his
life knowing that I was the one that
finally put him in his place
Ace climbed up the ladder real quick and
now he was on top of the food chain
there was nothing that could stop him
I finally got what he always wanted the
cause the girls but most importantly the
money
and he said from the police about
everything and I think she went back to
the bye
I tried to reach out or she just
disappeared and I never heard from her
again
I never got to say thank you for being
there for me when I needed you the most
okay finally going back and then Stevie
Skyrim the fuck
I really hope I don't see either again
they found yes monsford e and TJ was
found and put away for a very long time
I loved you more than life itself yes
ma'am
even if you did it but your presence in
my life has taught me something valuable
and you fully trust someone without any
doubt
you finally get one of two results
compress it for life or a lesson for
life sometimes we concentrate what has
been taken away
but never appreciate still
my friends
my brother's my family and yes we've had
our ups and downs but I see I would
rather walk with my friends in the dark
then they loaded the land
the young girl once said keep home
because maid makes you stronger there
Nancy braver and heartbreak makes you
wiser they say the hardest times often
greatest moments of life of a compliant
affair is one of them because he must
realize that everything you won
and now I look out and I realized
but I may not be like it again
the last thing diverland
your motto was the door
don't agenda and take care of this door
xuxa love her take care of her because
you have to remember she won't be there
forever and every light that shines in
my life nothing and I mean nothing
shines brighter than a mother's love
you
comedy
dun dun
you're so ungrateful fuck you shot sorry
okay
I like your mother stop
