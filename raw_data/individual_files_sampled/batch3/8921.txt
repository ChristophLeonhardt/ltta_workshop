TOP STORY. AT PRIME MINISTER BENJAMIN NETANYAHU SAYS THAT HE HAS PILES OF PROOF THAT IRAN HAS CONTINUED THEIR NUCLEAR PROGRAM. THEY SAY THEY HAVEN'T. MICHAEL IS HERE WITH US TODAY. HE SERVED AT THE U.S. EMBASSY IN TEL AVIV AND NOW HE'S AT THE WASHINGTON INSTITUTE. HI, MICHAEL. GOOD TO SEE YOU, SHEP. Shepard: HOW MUCH OF THIS IS NEW, FIRST? IT'S NOT CLEAR HOW MUCH OF IT MIGHT BE NEW. HE SAID THERE'S 100,000 DOCUMENTS. OBVIOUSLY SOME TIME WOULD BE REQUIRED IF IT'S NOT ALREADY DONE BEHIND CLOSED DOORS TO SIFT THROUGH THAT TO SEE WHAT WE ALREADY DIDN'T KNOW. A LOT OF IT LOOKS FAMILIAR. THE IDEA THAT IRAN WAS NOT EXACTLY FORTHCOMING ABOUT THEIR NUCLEAR WEAPONS PROGRAM IN THE PAST IS NOT NEW TO U.S. POLICY MAKERS. Shepard: AND YET THE UNITED STATES PEOPLE SAY THAT THE INTERNATIONAL INSPECTORS ARE GETTING THEIR JOB DONE AND IRAN IS COMPLYING WITH THE DEAL. WHAT WOULD THE CONSEQUENCES BE OF BACKING OUT OF THAT? JUST ONE QUICK POINT ON THE FIRST PART. THE PROBLEM IDENTIFIED BY THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION IS NOT IRAN'S COMPLIANCE WITH THE DEAL, BUT IT'S THE DEAL ITSELF. IT'S NOT STRONG ENOUGH. IRAN WASN'T REQUIRED TO REALLY COME CLEAN ON THIS PAST NUCLEAR WEAPONS WORKING TO ADMIT IT. THAT'S STOPPED INSPECTORS FROM ESTABLISHING A BASELINE FOR THEIR INSPECTION ACTIVITIES. IF THE U.S. PULLS OUT, IN A SENSE WE'RE STARTING FROM SCRATCH. WE'LL TRY TO REVIVE THAT ECONOMIC PRESSURE THROUGH SANCTIONS WHICH EXISTED BEFORE THE DEAL. PRIVATE SECTOR FIRMS WILL HAVE NO CHOICE TO COMPLY IF IT'S I RAN AND THE UNITED STATES MARKETS BUT WE'LL BE DOING IT WITHOUT THE COOPERATION OF OUR PARTNERS THAT WILL BE UPSET ABOUT IT. Shepard: THOSE PARTNERS INCLUDING UNITED KINGDOM AND GERMANY WHO WERE JUST AND FRANCE WHO WERE JUST HERE. THEY SEEM INTENT OKAY, WE CAN WORK ON OTHER THINGS. WE HAVE TO MAKE THIS DEAL STICK. THAT'S RIGHT. THE BASIC BARGAIN IN THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION HAS BEEN DRIVING AT, WE'LL STICK WITH THE DEAL, WE'LL STAY IN THE JCPOA IF YOU GUYS WORK WITH US TO NUMBER 1 CORRECT ITS FLAWS AND THAT'S FLAWS LIKE SOME OF THOSE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT TODAY AND ADDRESS IRAN'S ACTIVITIES MORE BROADLY IN THE MIDDLE EAST. THAT'S A PRETTY GOOD BARGAIN IF WE CAN GET IT. IF WE CAN'T GET IT, IT RAISES OTHER QUESTIONS. WITHDRAWING AND THROWING ALL THAT WORK OUT DOESN'T SEEM VERY WISE. THE DEMONSTRATION THAT PRIME MINISTER NETANYAHU REMINDED ME AGO. IF TRUE, IF WHOEVER WAS GOT THE DOCUMENTS AND THEY ARE WHAT THE PRIME MINISTER SAYS WHAT THEY ARE, ARE YOU IMPRESSED BY THAT? WELL, CERTAINLY. JUST THE INTELLIGENCE FEAT ITSELF IS VERY IMPRESSIVE, THIS IS A REAL COUP. THE ISRAELIS DESERVE A LOT OF COMMENDATION FOR THAT. WHETHER OR NOT THERE'S ANYBODY IN THIS TROVE, WHICH IS SUBSTANTIALLY NEW AND MORE IMPORTANTLY WHETHER IT SHOWS ANY OF THIS WORK IS I DON'T KNOW GOING, WHICH WOULD BE THE SMOKING GUN IS REALLY THE KEY QUESTION. WE HAVE TO DIG INTO THAT AND PROBABLY FOLLOW UP WITH INTERNATIONAL INSPECTIONS AS WELL. Shepard: HOW CONCERNED ARE YOU WITH TENSIONS AS RELATES TO SYRIA, IRAN AND ISRAEL? CONOR POWELL IS A LONG-TIME WORKED THERE, SOUNDED FROM HIS TONE LIKE WE'RE GETTING CLOSE. I CAN TELL YOU FROM WHAT I UNDERSTAND, THE ISRAELIS ARE WORRIED ABOUT IT AND WE SHOULD ALL BE WORRIED ABOUT IT. THE IRANIANS HAVE BEEN TRYING HARD TO BEEF UP THEIR MILITARY PRESENCE. THE ISRAELIS SAID THAT'S NOT TOLERABLE ESPECIALLY BECAUSE THE ONE DAY THAT IRAN COULD HAVE NUCLEAR WEAPONS AND THEN YOU HAVE A SIMILAR SITUATION WITH
