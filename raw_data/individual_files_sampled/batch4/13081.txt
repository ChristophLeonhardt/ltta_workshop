the culture wars begun have they we're gonna talk about the Emmys we'll talk about whether CNN likes boobs yeah really and we'll also talk about President Trump golfing towards Hillary's back or something and then tweeting about it I'm Ben Shapiro this is the Ben Shapiro show so all the things are stupid welcome back it's Monday yeah everything is very stupid this week and we will be talking about the Emmys in a little while but before we talk about the Emmys first I want to talk about all things political that are actually important or quasi important for a couple of reasons one is because the Emmys are less important than what's actually going on I'm gonna give you the entire narrative and then also because if we show too many clips of the Emmys then Facebook gets mad at us so we'll be showing those who these two look a bit later in the show but first I want to say thank you to my friends over a texture okay texture is a fantastic app where you can get basically

calm / better okay so as I say I could begin with the Emmys but before I get to the Emmys I really want to talk about why I think President Trump won now what's what's really interesting is when you talk about why President Trump won I know it's it's sort of an old topic but there's a phrase that's used very frequently you'll see a piece of news and somebody will say that's why Trump won and you'll see a piece of news and so that's why Trump won you notice it's never a piece of news that actually has to do with politics as ever a news that has to do with politics per se it's always something that has to do with the culture it's always a kindergarten forces young kids to be to be confronted with transgenderism or a baker is forced to cater a same-sex wedding there's always stuff like that this is why Trump won or somebody gets mad at a right-winger for some stupid reason they decide to fire Brendan I ship Mozilla Firefox and say ah that's why Trump won it's never about the issues the reason I say this and the reason I think this is deeply important is because it's very easy to get caught up in the idea the president Trump won because of particular political viewpoints I don't think that's correct that's important because right now President Trump is obviously in the middle of a shift toward the middle he's obviously shifting his politics from what people would consider the normal hardline right the kind of Ann Coulter populist right he's shifting from there to many Democratic policies and there are a lot of pundits people like Ann who have been saying well he's gonna lose his support base right this is the perspective of Steve Danon as well that he ran on all these populist issues and that's why he won I don't actually think that's why he won he'll Ross dude hat during the election cycle a guy who's sort of more mainstream traditional conservative than then Coulter Orban and he was saying the whole time that Trump won because he talked about issues nobody talked about before tariffs and trade and higher taxes and all this kind of stuff I really don't think that's what it was I think that a lot of the support for President Trump was attitudinal I think a lot of it was about attitude I think most of it was about culture and that's why the Emmys matter we'll get to the Emmys in a little while here but that's why the Emmys matter because if you watch the Emmys the Emmys will drive more votes into president Trump's column than anything he does in terms of straight policy this year or next the culture war is what people are hit with in the face every day they're not hit with policy every day most of the policies you live with are made at the local and state level they're not made at the federal level most of your life probably did not change all that much when President Obama was president on a policy level it changed somewhat rhyming our tax rates went up and down if you're in a business you had to deal with the Obamacare stick but if you're just a normal employee of a company your life probably probably did not change radically thanks to President Obama or thanks to george w bush or thanks to Bill Clinton or thanks to Ronald Reagan the fact is most be in our mass media era what matters most is the culture war everyone wants to focus in on the political war what matters most of the culture war and I'll show you why the SIG's so right now Tomica there again president Trump's in the middle of a policy shift and the shift is pretty thorough going Tom cotton who's been an ally of the president senator from Arkansas he was ripping on president Trump's president Trump's plans with regard to the DREAM Act over the weekend now remember President Trump campaigns on the idea that everyone has to go we have laws we're a country of laws this was his shtick is what he's dead and now President Trump says we're going to reinsure intent to bomb is deferred action on childhood arrivals we're gonna legalize everybody between the ages of 16 and 31 by 2012 and who had arrived in the country before 2007 and doesn't have a criminal record we're gonna legalize all those people were gonna make Congress do it and we're not gonna stump for a wall and we're not really gonna do much about our border problem but we're gonna give the Democrats what they want so Tom cotton was on Meet the Press with Chuck Todd he was basically saying this is the worst amnesty ever it's the biggest amnesty ever it's gonna be just terrible give me a definition of amnesty because it's in the eye of the beholder it feels particularly when it comes to uh it comes to this debate on the on the right side of the spectrum here what is your definition of amnesty well amnesty is giving legal status to people who came here illegally but the the core debate is not over what easily this is amnesty for daca well if you pass the so-called DREAM Act it will be the single biggest amnesty in the history of the United States even bigger than the 1986 amnesty which Ronald Reagan said was his biggest mistake in office but the core debate here has never been about legal status for these 700,000 or so people it's been we gonna control the negative side-effects of that which is undercutting American jobs in wages my legislation the Rays Act would do that and deterring more illegal immigration I mean put yourself in the shoes of a parent Canela see how many votes do you think are actually mobilized by this kind of policy the answer is I don't think that many I don't think that many hey this is why Trump feels so free to move Clinton did the same thing right on the left there was this idea that Bill Clinton was some great sort of leftist leader Bill Clinton cut deals with a Republican Congress on a regular basis they called the triangulation triangulation just means that he was gonna do popular stuff with the opposite party and his own base didn't care because again Bill Clinton was a culture warrior and all that matters is the culture war another example of President Trump moving to the left Heidi Heitkamp who's the senator from North Dakota she's a Democrat she's in serious trouble in her next Senate race Oh Trump has been out there campaigning with her saying she's a wonderful woman Heidi Heitkamp right now she's out there saying that she wants to do an infrastructure deal with Trump okay I can tell you that he think the president realizes that the best policy comes from bipartisan discussions and he wanted to host one and tell us that he's very interested in our input and so joe Manchin and Joe Donnelly and myself were invited to sit down with John soon from South Dakota Orrin Hatch from Utah Ron Johnson from Wisconsin and Pat Toomey from Pennsylvania and really spend a lot of time visiting about you know what our expectations were for tax reform try and figure out where the sweet spot is but we also talked about the infrastructure and being from New York from now he was talking about this during the campaign that we're gonna spend lots on infrastructure but obviously this is not typical mainstream conservatism we complained when President Obama dumped a trillion dollars are close to it in his stupid stimulus package that didn't do anything for the economy now Trump's doing the same thing do you think it's gonna lose him a lot of votes I don't okay how about the Paris Accords right this is a big win for conservatives the idea that Trump was gonna pull out of the global warming oriented Paris Accords this was in an accord that supposedly committed us to moving toward a carbon zero net carbon emissions economy Rex Tillerson the Secretary of State now he's walking it back he's saying well Trump might actually stay in the Paris Accords now again the right was celebrating this do you think the Trump's gonna lose a lot of votes because of this but there's a chance that if things get worked out both on the voluntary side from the US the voluntary restrictions for the US that it could change but then also in China there's a chance the US could stay in the Accord is that right I think under the right conditions the president said he's open to finding those conditions where we can remain engaged with others on what we all agree is still a challenging issue ok so again another issue where President Trump is obviously moving to the left is he's gonna lose him a lot of votes here's why I don't think it's going to lose him a lot of votes I don't think that it's gonna lose him a lot of votes because the truth is most people didn't vote for Trump thinking he was an ideologue it's amazing Democrats are finally now becoming to come around on this they're they're finally beginning to figure this out Adam Schiff Democrat from California he says just this that you know Trump's only ideology is being pro Trump yeah there were some of us who are saying this during the entire campaign Democrats though were saying that Trump was Hitler right Trump was Hitlerian it's that culture war that matters not the policy work is what Schiff says here's basically right Trump does not have an ideology he's just gonna do whatever he thinks is good for himself well I didn't make me question that because I think all of us recognize that that outreach for what it is and that's purely transactional purely something that will come up from time to time when the president decides it's in his personal interest to work with Democrats this is a president look who has no ideology he's not conservative he's not liberal the only consistent theme seems to be he's Pro Trump he's for his own person sometimes true but that doesn't actually make much of a difference because again the idea here is that in the culture war you are pro Trump or anti Trump again there's the political side where Trump is all over the place but nobody actually pays attention to that what people pay attention to is the narrative the media narrative the cultural narrative does something Andrew Breitbart from one of my mentors was very big on this idea that the culture was upstream of politics then what we imbibe from the from the culture around us is much more important than the politics of a given situation and this is particularly true of Trump again Trump is currently governing like a moderate Democrat okay what he's done over the last couple of weeks has been stuff that is straight from the Democrat playbook it is not from the conservative playbook but in a cultural way Trump is offensive to the left and the left is offensive to the Trump people and therefore there is a war going on even though he's now currently governing with Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer pretty isn't amazing something I'm gonna get to that culture war in just a second and why I think the President Trump this is one area where I think Trump is quite astute I'm gonna talk about that in just a second but first I want to say thank you to our sponsors over at Zeile so I am very big on the idea that you don't have

sheet set okay so why doesn't any of this matter why doesn't it matter that all of the issues that Trump ran on and that conservatives celebrate he seems to be moving away from now he's moving away from his hard stance on immigration and Ann Coulter's going nuts he's moving away from his hard stance on the Paris Accords and some people on the right are saying oh dude what the hell he's now moving toward infrastructure which was a populist Steve ban and talking point for a long time why doesn't any of that seem to matter why is it that that why is it that his shift on ideology doesn't seem to matter even Democrats are recognizing that he doesn't have ideology anymore why doesn't any of that seem to matter and the answer is because of the culture wars the culture wars are all that matter they're all that matter here is why President Trump is going to continue to maintain his base okay he tweeted this out yesterday this is a gift or a Jif I've still not decided how I wish to pronounce that that word here he is okay and it's a Jif of him hitting a golf ball that hits Hillary Clinton in the back and knocks her over right he retweeted this yesterday from an account called effed up mind except didn't say after right and I'll acknowledge it's pretty funny Jeff okay like we use this a similar Jeff with regards to somebody who dr. pepper balls right him hitting the golf ball and then it hitting that guy in the nads okay this I find slightly less funny just be it's still a little funny but the part that's the part that's not so funny about it is that the President of the United States is the one who's actually retweeting it okay it really is not particularly appropriate for the President of the United States to retweet things about him physically assaulting a fellow presidential candidate let alone a female presidential candidate because again the left is just going to cry sexism but his base loves this okay so long as Trump is willing to be quote-unquote politically incorrect and tweet this stuff then he's gonna love it and the left's gonna hate it so he's using the culture war in order to avoid the political war okay in other words this is WWE in WWE I haven't I can Sam and WWE kind of serve and I know this much you have the stock villains and you have the stock heroes and they fight each other and sometimes they switch places and the villain becomes the hero and the hero becomes the villain but everybody is playing a particular kind of role and in the end they go out back and they drink with one another it's not they actually hate each other it's all it's all did ok president Trump doesn't hate Hillary Clinton she was at his wedding if President Trump doesn't hate the left he's making deals with them right now but as part of the culture war he does culturally he doesn't like them and that's the part the American people see the American people see the culture they see the president from dislikes the left on a cultural level but he's willing to retweet stuff like this that shows malice with regard to with regard to Hillary Clinton and they like that doesn't matter that he's cutting deals with all of her friends Chuck Schumer's good friends with Hillary Clinton Nancy Pelosi is good friends of Hillary Clinton none of that matters because again it's cultural Tucker Carlson I think gets this exactly right with regard to Trump and it's why Trump has his finger on a pulse a lot of us don't follow you know a lot of us are very interested in data and so we like polls and pose her a great I mean data is better than no data that being said Tucker Carlson is right and I think Trump is right when he says that he Trump grants a lot more credibility to watching TV than he does to polls and I think that there is some I think there is something to that I think there's something smart about that here's Tucker Carlson explaining but I think more broadly he believes that television is a pretty clear window into what people care about he believes that television producers especially if highly rated shows understand what the public is interested in what it fears what it wants what it loves and so the TV programming is in some ways a more accurate reflection in the public mood than polling that's his view he said it to me and that's one of the reasons he watches a lot of television you know and whether that's true or not is it is it entirely debatable I think that's actually sort of true I think it is sort of true I think that if you're looking at I think it's actually very smart and very astute for President Trump now it may just be the Lexx watching TV but it's also true that what we watch on TV may be more indicative of what we truly feel then what we tell pollsters right it's a different process when watch TV that's sort of instinctual right you get up you get up in the morning or you're going to sleep at night you flip on the TV you put on what you enjoy you don't feel judged and then you watch what you watch and they're measuring the ratings that's not the same thing as when a pollster calls you and says what do you think of X now you have to go through a conscious process right Daniel Kahneman talks about this in sort of a different context the idea that you have almost two systems in your brain you have system one which is the fast move instinctive system and then you have system two which is the rational system that sort of overrides the instinctive system when you kick it in and we tend to mistake things that we're doing in system one for things that we're doing in system two so TV is done through system one you want to watch something you flip on the TV you watch whatever feels good and makes you feel good in your tummy and then there's system two which is what you tell pollsters or somebody ask you a question you consider you create a rationale you create a worldview and then you answer the question what is more accurate and when you go to vote are you voting with system water system - I think you're voting with system one and I think you're justifying it with system two at least the vast majority of voters I think the vast majority of voters have a gut feeling about a particular candidate and they decide how they're going to support that candidate and then they make up an excuse later I think a lot of people who are instinctively put off of President Trump on the left it wasn't that they hated his policies because he was closer to their policies than any Republican candidate of my lifetime no it was that he himself made them feel yucky and so they found a rationale for not voting for him and I think the same is true on the right with Hillary Clinton they didn't like Hillary Clinton an instinctive dislike of her some of it was political a lot of it was personal and therefore they came up with a rationale now the danger of that is that politics is not actually done in the system one way politics is not instinctive politics is where we try to create policy and policy has to be done with system two it has to be well thought out so what happens when you have a population that's voting based on system one that's instinctive quick make the move system in your brain but the policy that we need is based on system two what if we're electing people because we instinctively like them or dislike them but we actually need to be doing is engaging system to thinking about the policy in other words we should be thinking more about the DREAM Act and infrastructure and the Paris Accords than we are about Trump hitting golf ball and hitting Hillary Clinton in the back and retweeting it but that's not how we work that's not how we work and that's a problem and it also goes to why culture matters so much now people say things like well why do you even want if you don't like the Emmys why do you even care what the Emmys have to say the reason people care what the Emmys have to say is because the enemies are cultural because when you turn into the Emmys when you turn when you when you tune into that channel what you are doing is you are turning off your political brain and instinct way and then you're either going to react badly to it or react well to it it's very polarizing in a way that policy generally isn't I mean it really is quite fascinating when I talk policy with folks on the left I disagree with them radically on policy when we are both engaged in a conversation about policy the passion level is much lower even if we really disagree why because we're not engaged in the emotional part of our brain it's not your amygdala that's firing it's your prefrontal cortex right you're actually using the rational part of your brain but when it comes to who you vote for people get super passionate like it's so funny I can talk with the Democrat all day long about what is the best health care policy and I can make the case they're the best health care policy is one that is based on the notion that health care is a good not a right and I can't explain that and they can explain it right back to me but if if I say listen Obamacare sucks their immediate response is not okay let's talk about why Obamacare socks or whether it's good the immediate response is you racist jackass why because system one has kicked in because culture has kicked in it's why if you look at the polls fascinating if you look at the polls Obamacare is significantly less popular than the American than the American affordable care act or whatever they called it the ACA the Affordable Care Act the Affordable Care Act always pulled higher than Obamacare always and it's the exact same thing why because system one is in tune when you say Obamacare and system tune is system two is in tune when you say Affordable Care Act it removes it from the from the instinctive system a little bit a little bit and then once you get even less instinctive then people look at the policy and they hate it again they're really kind of interesting stuff that's why we tend to be in the media tend to focus around flashpoints if you look at the flash points in American politics they very rarely have to do with policy and they usually have to do with something sexy in the news so for example here's a sexy thing in the news right now there's their riots in st. Louis so if you haven't been watching there are all these protests in st. Louis regarding this guy named Jason Stockman Jason Stockman or Stockley rather Jason Stockley was a police officer who shot a guy named Anthony Lamar Smith in 2011 I'm gonna give you all the details and why this is important in just a second first I want to say thank you to our sponsors over at the US ECA so the US concealed-carry association these are folks who make sure that you are protected in case you have to fire your gun in self-defense very often you'll have a good guy who uses his gun to protect family from criminals and then he's the one who gets arrested because you got to know what to say to the police and what not to say to the police you got to know when you're allowed to fire in the first place and when you're not right now the the u.s.

Louis last night a bunch of properties broken into burned down I think is 80 people arrested cop was hit in the head with a brick pretty brutal the media have focused on the peaceful nature of some of the protests but it's gotten so bad that you to and moved Sheeran we're both supposed to do concerts in st. Louis they to cancel them because the police couldn't defend the concerts it says a lot like what we were sort of expecting to happen in Berkeley and the police showed up and shut it down in st. Louis they haven't been able to shut it down and so you've seen tremendous property destruction why because of the story about this police officer named Jason Stockley so in 2011 he killed the guy named Anthony Lamar Smith I will give you one guess as to the races of the people involved and why it's a national issue yes you got it that's right Jason Stockley the cop is white Anthony Lamar Smith is black and and so basically the case is this Anthony Lamar Smith was in the middle of a drug deal and the police were were staking him out he ran from the police after ramming them with his vehicle and then he finally crashed into an SUV Jason stock we popped out of the car he ran over to the car he took out his gun there's about 15 second gap and then Jason Stockley shot Anthony Lamar Smith he claims and Lamar Smith was going for his gun and that he had warned him not to and that he shot him and basically point-blank range people in the prosecution this guy was prosecuted this cop suggested that Jason Stockley had gone in with the intent to murder Anthony Lamar Smith and killed him and then planted a gun on him so here is some of the tape you can judge for yourself what you think happened here I here are some of the tape as to as to what happened so what you'll see I'll describe it for you if you're listening and what you'll see is Anthony Lamar Smith gets in his car the cops pull up behind him he tries to pull up against the curb then he realizes he's trapped he backs into the cop car two cops who merged what their guns drawn the driver refuses to stop one of the cops is holding what looks like an ak-47 and and which is he's privately an owner of so it's not as though the cops issue that so here you see it from a different angle Anthony Anthony Lamar Smith panics he backs into the cop car in an attempt to get out of there and and drives away so he basically comes very close to hitting this police officer the police officers hop back in their car the police car dash camera video isn't the best quality but look closely it starts at the Church's Chicken at Riverview and Thecla you can see the timestamp December 20th 2011 a rainy day the officers had stopped a car in a suspected drug deal here you can see Officer Jason Stockley exit the police cruiser in his hand his own personal weapon an ak-47 a violation of department policy he raises his hand to a car coming towards him then points the a.k at the car as the car drives away Stockley then pulls his department-issued weapon and fires it that he runs back to the police cruiser and he and the officer driving the cop car take chase at high rates of speed at one point they crash into a tree but continued to pursue the white car a camera inside the squad car also capturing that jarring moment you can hear the officers yelling prosecutors say at one point Stockley says quote going to kill this expletive several minutes later the cruiser catches up with the white car and rams the cruiser into it again the moment of impact seen from inside back on the dashcam Stockley and his partner are seen rushing up to the car moments later is when prosecutors say Stockley on the right shot five times striking the cars driver Anthony Lamar Smith and killing him at issue in part is exactly what Stockley does after the shooting okay so what happens is that you see him go back in his car dig through his backpack and then it's unclear what happened so he was this murder or was this not a murder so they waived the right to jury trial and instead they went directly to a judge which you can do I guess in the in the state of Missouri and the judge ruled that he was not guilty doesn't mean that he was not guilty in the technical sense in the in the full-on guilt an innocent sense it means that he's not guilty according to the letter of the law because you have to prove it beyond a reasonable doubt so there are a couple of things that I think are worth noting one Anthony Lamar Smith was involved in a drug deal tried to use his car to ram police officers ran away from the police officers at a high rate of speed endangering people and then according to the other officers there you can hear on the tape one of the other officers shouts gun you can hear him shout gun and then the officer jason Stockley shoots anthony Lamar Smith as far as the idea that he planted a gun in the car and that there was no actual gun in the car when I looked at the table I didn't see a situation which Stockley actually had the opportunity to plant a gun without other cops around that means all the other cops would have had to be in on it that if the the prosecution never bothered to call the other cops to testify that he had planted a gun which suggests either that everyone missed it or that Stockley didn't do it so here is what the judge rules okay the judge ruled that the that he it had not been proven that he planted the gun prosecutors argue that the presence of stock Lee's DNA on the gun proved that the gun must have been planted by the officer the defense countered that Stockley heard his partner yell gun and saw the driver's hand on a gun is this car sped by him stock Lee testified he does not try his service revolver and fire until he saw Smith reaching around inside the vehicle after it was stopped he said Smith changed his demeanor suggesting he found the gun so these are to varying cases Stockley testified after the shooting he found the gun tucked down between the seat and the central console and he rendered the gun safe by unloading cartridges from the cylinder and then left the gun and the cartridges on the passenger seat so the judge said it's a fact issue that's central whether Smith had the gun when he was shot he said the state's contention the officer planted the gun was not supported by the evidence why because a full sized revolver was too large for the officer to hide in his pants pocket and he was not wearing a jacket and if the gun had been tucked into his belt it would have been visible on a bystanders video this is what the judge ruled how about the outbursts saying that he was going to kill this guy so the part of the prosecutor said that this was clear intense the judge said lots of things happen when they're in the middle of a high-speed chase he was saying stuff okay bottom line is this is a pretty controversial ruling but is it clear that this is that this cop murdered the guy I don't think it's absolutely clear the cop murdered the guy I don't think that it's absolutely clear in any way again the legal standard is proof beyond a reasonable doubt now the reason that people have that this is important is because what you see once again is this is a cultural issue not a policy issue on policy we all agree supposedly right guilt beyond a reasonable doubt and we all agree the cops should not shoot innocent people so on a policy level we all agree with this and we agree that if there was evidence that this is a racist shooting the guy should go to jail right everyone was appalled when there was that case in South Carolina where Walter Scott a black eye was shot in the back by a cop and you can see the cop planting a gun next to Walter Scott I believe that he was convicted later but in any case if there's a hung jury in any case everyone was appalled if he was not convicted but this is a major public policy issue nonetheless even though it has nothing to do with policy why because it's cultural because it's cultural meaning people react by saying this is indicative of a system that's racist or they react by saying this is indicative of a bunch of people who are always going to say that the system is racist even without evidence that the system is racist these cultural issues shift more votes than anything that President Trump does on policy policy does not shift votes in the same way that culture does and that is because of the mass media so that's why the Emmys matter that's why the Emmys matter so finally at long last I want to get to the Emmys the Emmys did not get great ratings last night they did not get terrific ratings because they're not very good nobody watches these award shows anymore anymore and they still get huge ratings against other against other TV but this was a very very low rated Emmys part of that is because people are alienated by culture being used to foment politics part of it is because all the TV shows that are now being rewarded our TV shows that a lot of people have never seen right nobody watched The Handmaid's Tale I mean in terms of relative numbers nobody watched The Handmaid's Tale the shows that were up for awards were Westworld basically Handmaid's Tale and and the other one never was stranger things stranger things those were the three that were up for a lot of awards last night Handmaid's Tale basically swept and it swept because of politics so people were not going to tune in to watch a bad book become a bad TV series and then get awarded a lot so the politics made a difference this is the thing that Hollywood really doesn't understand if they were a little bit less overt in their politics they'd actually be much more effective in shifting the cultural debate but it's the culture war that truly matters right people like Trump because they hate the Emmys people like from because they hate Stephen Colbert people like Trump because they hate what they saw last night with a bunch of rich puffed up arrogant elitists who suggests they know best for the rest of America while living in their palatial estate soph the Sunset Boulevard and avoiding their taxes by banking offshore that's what people see when they watch the Emmys that culture war matters a lot more than where Trump is on the Paris agreements so long as Trump continues to show scorn for Hollywood so long as he shows scorn for leftist cultural institutions he's gonna get away with whatever policy he wants to get away with so before I get to

everything that Americans like about Trump because they hate this they hate this from Hollywood they're sick of being lectured they're sick of being told that they're wrong they're sick of being told that they're rubes they're sick of being told that there's no such thing as gender they're sick of being told that gender is a construct in the mind they're sick of being told that America is a backwards place for women and black people they're sick of being lectured that's what Hollywood does and when Trump doesn't do that Trump wins of matter about the Paris climate Accords because who cares what does matter is that he hates Stephen Colbert so here's the beginning opening musical number well hi open up let Archer slip inside again the whole thing is a rip on the news right so the news is terrible the news is what about people could think the news in that terrible all right I mean no like there's like half the country the things that the news isn't like it's not the stock markets up right I mean like people are getting their jobs back this idea that everything is garbage and that we're all going to die I just died there's not a lot of evidence of that and then we finally get to the end of this and I don't know if we can fast forward to the the graphic where we have The Handmaid's Tale at the very end of this little musical number there's a there's he brings out a bunch of people to dance for The Handmaid's Tale and it's a bunch of people in basically spandex lingerie outfits including a bunch of dudes right because transgenderism yay so if you're watching this at home and you're annoyed by this and every five seconds there's a there's a trump joke they're like okay well listen if I have to choose between Hollywood and Trump I'll choose belches Trump the cultural issues matter and Hollywood needs to understand this because if they were smart what they would do is shut up if Hollywood were smart they would shut up they really would they would go back to making entertaining things without a lot of the political messaging the reason being they are providing Trump the wall to bounce up against right Trump is a is rubber ease of rubber ball bounces up against things and he bounces up against Hollywood the rest of the American people will bounce right with him they don't like Hollywood we like to watch it that doesn't mean we like you right we like to watch floyd mayweather box too but he's a jerk that doesn't mean we like you and if we're forced to choose between floyd mayweather and anyone else we'll choose anyone else and if we're forced to choose between the hollywood morality and anyone else you'll choose anyone else and then if holly let's say hollywood shut up for a second let's say that hollywood would stop with this with his nonsense where they feel like they have to promulgate their politics every five seconds if hollywood actually shop about it trump wouldn't have anything to moan about right we'd actually have to focus in on his policy and then we could get to some good discussions hopefully we could move him to the right hopefully we'd start to get about put care about policy again as a conservative i want

the word out as well we are the largest conservative podcast in the nation all righty so the opening musical number wasn't even that the bad part right that was pretty mild stuff then we got to Colbert's opening monologue and his opening monologue really was pathetic of course there's no way anyone could possibly watch that much TV other than the president who seemed to have a lot of time for that sort of thing hello sir thank you for joining us looking forward to the tweets okay so he made a bunch of Trump jokes all throughout the evening it never stopped at any point and then they brought out at one point Sean Spicer to mock Trump and to mock himself so so as ho Spicer was of course played by Melissa McCarthy who won an Emmy last night for playing Spicer Alec Baldwin won an Emmy for playing Trump Kate McKinnon won an Emmy for playing Hilary so basically everyone won an Emmy for playing the part of political people which just demonstrates the merger between politics and entertainment right that we don't talk about the the if we have to choose between Alec Baldwin and Donald Trump Donald Trump wins that battle every time in any case in the middle of this Sean Spicer is brought out to make a joke about himself and the left loses their minds over this Sean do you know in Emmys period both in person and around the world okay so again the what's funny about this listen I think it's funny that he did this I think that it's funny that Sean Spicer participated although I've objected in the past to all of these politicians participating if we're gonna do it this is funnier than Obama's just showing up on random shows or Biden showing up on random shows because he is the butt of the joke the left went nuts over this they went crazy again culture wars matter more than politics the culture war matters Sean Spicer comes out makes a joke about himself he's mocking himself here right he's mocking his whole Trump had the biggest audience in history stick from the inauguration and what what's the upshot Melissa McCarthy says she was insulted that he stole her joke really people on the Left were insulted that Sean Spicer had been normalized is these are the same people who say that Chelsea Manning is a hero he's the same people say the Chelsea Manning vice ran a headline today that she has had Chelsea Manning is the purest soul on the Internet what in the hell but these are the people who say Sean Spicer must never be normalized Ben Rhodes was national security adviser under President Obama and who blatantly lied about the Iran's yield to the American people for years he said how could we normalize Sean Spicer again culture Wars culture wars and then it gets worse Jane Fonda right the lady who sat on a Vietcong gun pointed a North Vietnamese Army gun pointed in American soldiers and Lily Tomlin they show up to mock president Trump into a 9 to 5 routine well yeah well back in 1980 in that movie we refuse to be controlled by a sexist egotistical lying hypocritical bigot and interment in 2017 we still refuse to be controlled by a sexist so much courage Wow you refused to be frankly he doesn't care about you when is he trying to control you what'd he do again this is what Hollywood doesn't understand their culture war makes this into a culture war not a political war and then kate mckinnon gets up and she's one who played Hillary Clinton at the end on SNL and you'll recall that she actually sang hallelujah after Hillary Clinton lost like a weepy hallelujah tribute to Hillary Clinton this is so clear she wanted Hillary to one I guess she gets up and she thanks Hillary Clinton I don't remember Chevy Chase thanking Gerald Ford for playing Gerald Ford here's here's Kate McKinnon thank you to fern and Sue's my la moms thank you jack I love you what else thank you I was on a very personal no I wasn't a thank-you to Hillary Clinton for your grace and thank you I love you okay thanking Hillary Clinton on a personal note thank you so much uh-huh okay this is why the ratings are low for the Emmys it's why culture is not only losing its impact it's losing its voice it's why it's not even really pushing Americans to the left anymore because it's it's so blatant and it's also why Trump is winning Trump is winning because of people like this Trump is winning because so long as it's a culture war Trump can win but here's the problem so long as it's a culture war Republicans can win but conservatives won't okay the only thing that conservatives can win on we can use the culture war to win but then we have to have a political war or a push for policy it is not enough to react to Kate McKinnon it's not enough to react to Stephen Colbert you then have to promulgate good policy not move to the left okay so just because you hate the Emmys doesn't mean you should support president Trump's policies even if you think that he's right and the Emmys are wrong okay time for a couple of things I like done some things that I hate so things that I like over the weekend I read a book I'd never read before actually the book Rebecca by Daphne du Maurier is a very famous book it was much more famous probably first half of the 20th century it's one of the very early kind of suspense novels and the movie it won Best Picture in 1940 Laurence Olivier and Joan Fontaine Joan Fontaine was the sisters with Olivia de Havilland so that's why they look so much alike but the the basic story is that Joan Fontaine is this kind of young girl very naive who marries who marries Laurence Olivier's character max de winter and max de winter has this very shadowy past he lives at this ginormous palatial estate called Manderley and she is brought in after the death of his first wife and marries him and and here is a little bit of the preview of the movie the movie is quite good the book is better picture ever made David O Selznick and Alfred Hitchcock bring you the Grand Slam Prize winner that made motion picture history winner the Academy Award voted by America's critics as the best picture of the year and now as a result of a national poll winning new honours as audiences throughout the country vote to see it again the Selznick studios successor to Gone with the Wind Rebecca brought to the screen with all the warmth and emotion that made millions of readers that claim Daphne du Maurier's bestseller is the most exciting love story of our time okay one of the things that I like about this previous that nationally reference is the book right how literate is a preview when it actually references specific passages from the book and shows how closely it used to the book kind of cool and the adaptation is is is very good and this is very very early Laurence Olivier watch him and this and then watch him in marathon band and then that's a transformation okay other things that I like so this this is a pretty amazing video there's a 66 year old bodybuilder for I guess his color blind and his family got him a set of these very expensive glasses that allowed him to see color for the very first time so here he is seeing color for the first time in his life what a month look can you see with our eyes smell baby and what colors you see those you see colors now now you have rose-colored glasses baby work now you see with our eyes do you like the balloons it is pretty amazing how I'm I mean the technology that we have not to be able to do these kinds of things it's really incredible and also there's something wonderful about the fact that when we finally experience something wonderful in life we're almost reduced to children again you get that you get that feeling from him it's pretty amazing okay time for a a quick thing that I hate so clay Travis but it is a commentator on Fox Sports and I'd be remiss if I did not comment on this because it was just making the entire office laugh hysterically last week Clay Travis was was on CNN with Brooke Baldwin and I'm not sure the name of the other fellow and he decides to drop his slogan so apparently Clay Travis is sort of almost a quasi Howard Stern ask sports figure like he drops obscenity on his show and he does this kind of man show vibe and he dropped one of his slogans and Brooke Baldwin was not prepared for it and here's how it went I think that's a bad move I'm a First Amendment absolutist I believe in only two things completely the First Amendment and boobs and so once they made the decision that they were not going to say it's related commentary they couldn't I just want to make sure I heard you correctly as a woman hanging anchoring the show did you say what did you say you believe in the First Amendment ends be double OBS boobs to things that have only never let me were down in this entire country's history the First Amendment and boobs so for somebody to come on CNN and to say something like the only thing I believe in in a discussion there - and I just want to make sure I'm hearing you correctly z-bo OBS because as a woman I'm I said boobs I believe completely in the First Amendment and in boobs those the only two things I believe 100% and in this country and by the way jemelle has he went straight to that yeah you're absolutely right I've on national television and with the female host I say on the radio because it's true and that's what I do he said okay so there are a few things that I think ought to be noted about this first of all is it appropriate for Clay Travis to say First Amendment and boobs on national TV in the middle of a news show of course it's not appropriate it's ridiculous okay but the part that's so absurd is the that's so sexist how could you say such a thing that's so sexist and horrifying oh okay it's not sexist to say men like boobs can this is devolution evolutionary biology suggests that men are attracted to secondary sexual characteristics including breasts okay if we Minh have trouble with that then I would suggest that they argue with a biology textbook there are a lot of women who work at this office I showed this to my wife my wife thought this was the funniest thing she'd ever seen it's so absurd it's so ridiculous okay it's just possible is it possible that we can just say stuff is stupid without us being deeply offended by it you can even see in this clip if you go back to the beginning of the clip you can see when he first says it Brooke Baldwin wants to laugh like you can see she's about to laugh and then she stops herself and she and she decides that it's time for her to get offended like what watch her expression when he first says it she actually starts to laugh because she realizes how stupid this whole thing is and then she realizes that she has to get offended because society mandates that we all get offended about stupid nonsense now so here's what watch watch Baldwin's face in this I just want to make sure you're anchoring this show right you can see she wants to laugh right cuz it's hysterical he just said boobs in the middle of the show for no reason okay we're all five-year-olds that's funny come on and then is it appropriate again no it's not appropriate does it lower the discourse yes but for God's sake I mean I'm a vulgar ization of the discourse President Trump is the president dancing vulgar ization of the discourse I think that that ship may have sailed a while ago I can lament the ship sailing but I'm not gonna pretend that this is even close to the outer limit of the ship sailing again CNN doesn't get to complain about that either here was their new you here was their new year's episode 2016 and the decision all night has been should it be a tattoo person I mean what are you thinking I don't want to know white crazy women really let me ask let me ask Kathy I think Anderson Pearson is on live national TV CNN right okay so we're gonna like whine about national discourse like CNN take a look in the mirror again I can I can say that our discourse has gone down the toilet and I can also say that we cannot we don't have to be deeply offended by Clay Travis leaking breasts I'm sorry like I'm not gonna pretend to be deeply if it I think John pot Horace is lying about this was exactly correct was this appropriate no but you sort of have to agree with the sentiment all right fair enough we'll be back here tomorrow with all other things stupid and ridiculous again that's that's another one of those that falls under this is why Trump won right cultural issues people getting offended over a guy saying he likes boobs one reason the Trump won ah everything is stupid apparently there's a story out today by the way and there's an old there's an old prophecy that's been interpreted to say that the world will end on September 23rd if it does I can't say that we've lost a lot according to this particular we'll be back tomorrow please world try to do better I'm Ben Shapiro this is the Ben Shapiro show
