OWENS, ALSO A TUCSON RESIDENT, 

193
00:11:09,568 --> 00:11:10,936
THAT WAS BACK IN 1980. 

194
00:11:10,936 --> 00:11:12,404
AGAIN, THE CEREMONY WILL TAKE 

195
00:11:12,404 --> 00:11:15,107

FAMILY AND FRIENDS. 

220
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:49,888
JOHN MCCAIN BELIEVED IN 

221
00:19:49,888 --> 00:19:50,155
AMERICA. 

222
00:19:50,155 --> 00:19:54,393
HE BELIEVED IN ITS PEOPLE, ITS 

223
00:19:54,393 --> 00:19:55,527
VALUES AND ITS INSTITUTIONS. 

224
00:19:55,527 --> 00:19:56,862
YOU SEE, HE CAME TO THIS 

225
00:19:56,862 --> 00:19:58,563
REALIZATION DURING HIS TIME AS 

226
00:19:58,563 --> 00:19:59,731
A P.O.W. 

227
00:19:59,731 --> 00:20:00,031
IN VIETNAM. 

228
00:20:00,031 --> 00:20:02,134
I FELL IN LOVE WITH MY COUNTRY, 

229
00:20:02,134 --> 00:20:06,238
HE SAID WHEN I WAS A PRISONER 

230
00:20:06,238 --> 00:20:06,738
IN SOMEONE ELSE'S. 

231
00:20:06,738 --> 00:20:10,509
AS A RESULT HE DEDICATED HIS 

232
00:20:10,509 --> 00:20:12,376
LIFE TO SERVE HIS COUNTRY. 

233
00:20:12,376 --> 00:20:15,480
WHEN HE SAW CHALLENGES TO ITS 

234
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:17,149
INSTITUTIONS OR VALUES, HE 

235
00:20:17,149 --> 00:20:19,584
FOUGHT TO PROTECT THEM, THUS 

236
00:20:19,584 --> 00:20:21,553
HIS EFFORTS TO REIGN IN EXCESS 

237
00:20:21,553 --> 00:20:22,321
CAMPAIGN EXPENDITURES AND 

238
00:20:22,321 --> 00:20:27,926
CONGRESSIONAL EARMARKS WHICH HE 

239
00:20:27,926 --> 00:20:29,461
VIEWED AS CORRUPTING OUR VALUES 

240
00:20:29,461 --> 00:20:29,861
AND INSTITUTIONS. 

241
00:20:29,861 --> 00:20:31,229
AND HIS INSISTENCE THAT BATTLE 

242
00:20:31,229 --> 00:20:34,866
FD DETAINEES BE TREATED IN 

243
00:20:34,866 --> 00:20:36,635
ACCORDANCE WITH AMERICAN LAW 

244
00:20:36,635 --> 00:20:36,935
AND VALUES. 

245
00:20:36,935 --> 00:20:39,371
IN INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS, HIS 

246
00:20:39,371 --> 00:20:43,642
BELIEFS LED SENATOR McCAIN TO 

247
00:20:43,642 --> 00:20:45,110
PROMOTE AMERICAN PRINCIPLES OF 

248
00:20:45,110 --> 00:20:46,378
FREEDOM AND DEMOCRACY FOR 

249
00:20:46,378 --> 00:20:49,481
OTHERS, AND IN OUR MILITARY 

250
00:20:49,481 --> 00:20:51,750
CAMPAIGNS TO SUPPORT OUR 

251
00:20:51,750 --> 00:20:52,684
MISSIONS AND OUR TROOPS. 

252
00:20:52,684 --> 00:20:55,821
JOHN HAD A KEEN EYE FOR 

253
00:20:55,821 --> 00:20:56,988
AMERICAN INTERESTS AND COULD 

254
00:20:56,988 --> 00:20:57,956
SPOT DANGER'S ADVERSARIES A 

255
00:20:57,956 --> 00:20:58,256
MILE AWAY. 

256
00:20:58,256 --> 00:20:59,858
HE WAS AMONG THE FIRST TO 

257
00:20:59,858 --> 00:21:02,861
ADVOCATE THE SURGE IN IRAQ, TO 

258
00:21:02,861 --> 00:21:04,096
REGAIN THE INITIATIVE IN THE 

259
00:21:04,096 --> 00:21:04,429
WAR THERE. 

260
00:21:04,429 --> 00:21:05,464
I'VE BEEN WITH SENATOR McCAIN 

261
00:21:05,464 --> 00:21:07,299
ALL AROUND THE WORLD, AND I 

262
00:21:07,299 --> 00:21:11,069
WILL TELL YOU THAT HE HAD 

263
00:21:11,069 --> 00:21:12,971
BETTER INSTINCTS ABOUT HOW AND 

264
00:21:12,971 --> 00:21:16,208
WHEN AND WHERE TO ASSERT 

265
00:21:16,208 --> 00:21:18,443
AMERICAN POWER THAN ANY OTHER 

266
00:21:18,443 --> 00:21:19,244
LEADER THAT I'VE KNOWN. 

267
00:21:19,244 --> 00:21:21,179
HE HAD BEEN TO MORE COUNTRY, 

268
00:21:21,179 --> 00:21:22,814
KNEW MORE FOREIGN LEADERS AND 

269
00:21:22,814 --> 00:21:26,418
HAD A BETTER GRASP OF HISTORY 

270
00:21:26,418 --> 00:21:30,054
THAN ANY OTHER AMERICAN 

271
00:21:30,054 --> 00:21:32,290
OFFICIAL, INCLUDING OUR 

272
00:21:32,290 --> 00:21:32,891
SECRETARIES OF STATE. 

273
00:21:32,891 --> 00:21:35,727
ONE ILLUSTRATION THAT WE'RE ALL 

274
00:21:35,727 --> 00:21:37,829
FAMILIAR WITH WAS WHEN OTHERS 

275
00:21:37,829 --> 00:21:41,166
WERE LOOKING INTO VLADIMIR 

276
00:21:41,166 --> 00:21:43,935
PUTIN'S EYES WITH AN EYE OF 

277
00:21:43,935 --> 00:21:44,770
UNDERSTANDING HIM AND REACHING 

278
00:21:44,770 --> 00:21:46,038
ACCOMMODATION WITH HIM. 

279
00:21:46,038 --> 00:21:49,775
JOHN, OF COURSE, SAID I LOOKED 

280
00:21:49,775 --> 00:21:53,612
INTO HIS EYES AND I SAW KGB. 

281
00:21:53,612 --> 00:21:54,813
WHILE I BELIEVE JOHN'S GREATEST 

282
00:21:54,813 --> 00:21:55,814
CONTRIBUTION WAS TO AMERICAN 

283
00:21:55,814 --> 00:22:01,253
NATIONAL SECURITY, WE MUST 

284
00:22:01,253 --> 00:22:02,688
COMMENT A BIT ON ARIZONA 

285
00:22:02,688 --> 00:22:03,722
INTERESTS AS WELL. 

286
00:22:03,722 --> 00:22:05,790
IN A WORD, HE LOVED HIS ADOPTED 

287
00:22:05,790 --> 00:22:06,191
STATE. 

288
00:22:06,191 --> 00:22:07,592
HE LOVED ITS BEAUTY, HE WAS 

289
00:22:07,592 --> 00:22:09,261
COMMITTED TO PROTECTING OUR 

290
00:22:09,261 --> 00:22:10,629
WATER, OUR ENVIRONMENT AND OUR 

291
00:22:10,629 --> 00:22:10,896
FORESTS. 

292
00:22:10,896 --> 00:22:12,931
HE WORKED THROUGHOUT HIS CAREER 

293
00:22:12,931 --> 00:22:14,533
WITH OUR NATIVE AMERICAN 

294
00:22:14,533 --> 00:22:17,235
CITIZENS AND WITH ARIZONA'S 

295
00:22:17,235 --> 00:22:17,502
VETERANS. 

296
00:22:17,502 --> 00:22:21,940
HE WAS A BIG CHAMPION OF OUR 

297
00:22:21,940 --> 00:22:23,308
MANY MILITARY INSTALLATIONS. 

298
00:22:23,308 --> 00:22:25,844
SOME HAVE DISAGREED WITH SOME 

299
00:22:25,844 --> 00:22:28,079
OF SENATOR McCAIN'S VOTES ON 

300
00:22:28,079 --> 00:22:31,183
POLICY POSITIONS, BUT THAT 

301
00:22:31,183 --> 00:22:32,083
SHOULD NOT DIMINISH OUR 

302
00:22:32,083 --> 00:22:34,118
GRATITUDE FOR HIS SERVICE. 

303
00:22:34,118 --> 00:22:37,222
AND LET'S RETURN TO WHERE I 

304
00:22:37,222 --> 00:22:39,558
BEGAN, JOHN'S LOVE FOR AMERICA 

305
00:22:39,558 --> 00:22:40,091
AND ARIZONA. 

306
00:22:40,091 --> 00:22:43,328
HE REPRESENTED OUR VALUES ALL 

307
00:22:43,328 --> 00:22:45,230
OVER THE WORLD AS SENATOR FROM 

308
00:22:45,230 --> 00:22:48,200
ARIZONA, AND AMERICA IS 

309
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:50,101
STRONGER FOR HIS FIERCE DEFENSE 

310
00:22:50,101 --> 00:22:51,403
OF OUR VALUES. 

311
00:22:51,403 --> 00:22:53,872
WE CAN BE PROUD HE WAS OUR 

312
00:22:53,872 --> 00:22:54,139
SENATOR. 

313
00:22:54,139 --> 00:22:56,508
I CONSIDER IT A GREAT PRIVILEGE 

314
00:22:56,508 --> 00:22:58,243
TO HAVE SERVED WITH JOHN AND I 

315
00:22:58,243 --> 00:23:04,549
WILL MISS HIM AS A FRIEND AND 

316
00:23:04,549 --> 00:23:13,391
AS A STRONG FORCE FOR AMERICA 

317
00:23:13,391 --> 00:23:28,006
IN THE WORLD. 

318
00:23:28,006 --> 00:23:30,976
>> WE'VE ALL SEEN THE GRAINY 

319
00:23:30,976 --> 00:23:33,778
VIDEO, A YOUNG MAN IN HIS 30s 

320
00:23:33,778 --> 00:23:38,149
EMERGES FROM BEHIND THE FOLDING 

321
00:23:38,149 --> 00:23:40,051
DOORS OF A BUS, PLOWS FORWARD 

322
00:23:40,051 --> 00:23:40,418
WITH STRENGTH. 

323
00:23:40,418 --> 00:23:47,058
HIS FEET LAND ON THE GROUND, 

324
00:23:47,058 --> 00:23:48,259
AND HE LIMPS FORWARD TOWARDS 

325
00:23:48,259 --> 00:23:49,027
FREEDOM. 

326
00:23:49,027 --> 00:23:51,463
IT'S JOHN MCCAIN, AND HE'S JUST 

327
00:23:51,463 --> 00:23:54,666
SPENT FIVE YEARS AS A PRISONER 

328
00:23:54,666 --> 00:23:57,269
OF WAR, SHOT DOWN, EJECTED FROM 

329
00:23:57,269 --> 00:23:59,771
HIS PLANE, HIS RIGHT LEG AND 

330
00:23:59,771 --> 00:24:00,838
BOTH ARMS ARMS BROKEN. 

331
00:24:00,838 --> 00:24:01,873
HE MANAGED MIRACULOUSLY TO SAVE 

332
00:24:01,873 --> 00:24:04,209
HIMSELF FROM DROWNING IN THE 

333
00:24:04,209 --> 00:24:09,347
LAKE IN WHICH HE LANDED ONLY TO 

334
00:24:09,347 --> 00:24:09,981
BE CAPTURED BY THE NORTH 

335
00:24:09,981 --> 00:24:10,882
VIETNAMESE. 

336
00:24:10,882 --> 00:24:12,918
NO ONE EXPECTED JOHN MCCAIN TO 

337
00:24:12,918 --> 00:24:15,586
MAKE IT THROUGH THE NIGHT. 

338
00:24:15,586 --> 00:24:20,725
BUT AS ONE OF HIS PELLO P.O.W.s 

339
00:24:20,725 --> 00:24:23,128
PUT IT, DYING WAS NOT IN HIS 

340
00:24:23,128 --> 00:24:26,198
PLAN -- FELLOW POWs PUT IT, 

341
00:24:26,198 --> 00:24:27,231
DYING WAS NOT IN HIS PLAN. 

342
00:24:27,231 --> 00:24:29,167
CONFINED TO SOLITUDE AND 

343
00:24:29,167 --> 00:24:33,338
TORTURE, THIS SON AND GRANDSON 

344
00:24:33,338 --> 00:24:35,040
OF NAVY ADMIRALS REPEATEDLY 

345
00:24:35,040 --> 00:24:37,742
REFUSED RELEASE UNTIL EVERY 

346
00:24:37,742 --> 00:24:40,011
OTHER AMERICAN BROTHER WAS 

347
00:24:40,011 --> 00:24:40,444
RELEASED WITH HIM. 

348
00:24:40,444 --> 00:24:41,746
OF ALL THE SPEECHES, INTERVIEWS 

349
00:24:41,746 --> 00:24:44,449
AND TOWN HALL MEETINGS THAT 

350
00:24:44,449 --> 00:24:47,018
HAVE BEEN PLAYED AND REPLAYED 

351
00:24:47,018 --> 00:24:48,186
THESE DAYS SINCE JOHN MCCAIN 

352
00:24:48,186 --> 00:24:51,056
HAS LEFT US, IT'S THIS MOMENT 

353
00:24:51,056 --> 00:24:55,026
MORE THAN ANY OTHER THAT CAN'T 

354
00:24:55,026 --> 00:24:57,128
HELP BUT STIR A SPIRIT OF 

355
00:24:57,128 --> 00:24:57,728
PATRIOTISM DEEP INSIDE EVERY 

356
00:24:57,728 --> 00:24:59,331
AMERICAN, BRINGING GOOSE BUMPS 

357
00:24:59,331 --> 00:25:02,968
TO YOUR ARMS AND LEAVING THE 

358
00:25:02,968 --> 00:25:04,602
HAIR STANDING ON THE BACK OF 

359
00:25:04,602 --> 00:25:07,939
YOUR NECK BECAUSE AS YOU WATCH 

360
00:25:07,939 --> 00:25:10,875
HIS RELEASE AND LEARN HIS 

361
00:25:10,875 --> 00:25:13,912
STORY, THE SENATOR'S LIFE, 

362
00:25:13,912 --> 00:25:16,848
LESSONS AND WISDOM TAKE ON A 

363
00:25:16,848 --> 00:25:17,515
MUCH MORE MEANINGFUL CONTEXT. 

364
00:25:17,515 --> 00:25:20,418
WHEN JOHN MCCAIN CALLED ON US 

365
00:25:20,418 --> 00:25:22,020
TO SERVE A PURPOSE GREATER THAN 

366
00:25:22,020 --> 00:25:24,923
ONE'S OWN SELF INTEREST, IT 

367
00:25:24,923 --> 00:25:26,791
WASN'T A TALKING POINT DESIGNED 

368
00:25:26,791 --> 00:25:28,959
TO WIN THE NEXT ELECTION. 

369
00:25:28,959 --> 00:25:31,963
IT WAS HOW HE HAD ACTUALLY 

370
00:25:31,963 --> 00:25:34,599
LIVED HIS LIFE AND CONTINUED TO 

371
00:25:34,599 --> 00:25:37,869
LIVE HIS LIFE. 

372
00:25:37,869 --> 00:25:42,073
IT'S HOW HE WANTED US TO LIVE 

373
00:25:42,073 --> 00:25:42,273
OURS. 

374
00:25:42,273 --> 00:25:44,843
HIS TALK OF COUNTRY FIRST 

375
00:25:44,843 --> 00:25:46,044
WASN'T SIMPLY A SLOGAN ON A 

376
00:25:46,044 --> 00:25:46,411
YARD SIGN. 

377
00:25:46,411 --> 00:25:51,583
IT WAS WHAT JOHN MCCAIN HAD 

378
00:25:51,583 --> 00:25:54,586
DONE AND DEMONSTRATED OVER AND 

379
00:25:54,586 --> 00:25:56,788
OVER AND OVER AGAIN IN THE 

380
00:25:56,788 --> 00:25:58,557
NAVY, THROUGH VIETNAM, AND ALL 

381
00:25:58,557 --> 00:26:02,394
THE WAY TO HIS FAVORITE BATTLES 

382
00:26:02,394 --> 00:26:10,569
ON THE FLOOR OF THE UNITED 

383
00:26:10,569 --> 00:26:10,936
STATES SENATE. 

384
00:26:10,936 --> 00:26:12,537
IN 2008 HE ELECTRIFYIED MANY IN 

385
00:26:12,537 --> 00:26:14,072
MINNEAPOLIS PROCLAIMING WE ARE 

386
00:26:14,072 --> 00:26:17,541
AMERICANS AND WE NEVER GIVE UP. 

387
00:26:17,541 --> 00:26:19,144
WE NEVER QUIT. 

388
00:26:19,144 --> 00:26:20,044
WE NEVER HIDE FROM HISTORY. 

389
00:26:20,044 --> 00:26:20,911
WE MAKE HISTORY. 

390
00:26:20,911 --> 00:26:23,181
THOSE WEREN'T THE EMPTY WORDS 

391
00:26:23,181 --> 00:26:24,649
OF SOME POLITICIAN GRABBING THE 

392
00:26:24,649 --> 00:26:31,356
MICROPHONE AND THE SPOTLIGHT 

393
00:26:31,356 --> 00:26:32,690
FOR A FEW FLEETING MOMENTS. 

394
00:26:32,690 --> 00:26:34,292
MEN HAD FOLLOWED JOHN MCCAIN 

395
00:26:34,292 --> 00:26:37,329
INTO BATTLE, AND WE KNEW WE 

396
00:26:37,329 --> 00:26:40,732
COULD DO THE SAME. 

397
00:26:40,732 --> 00:26:46,204
THIS MAN WAS TRUSTED AND HE WAS 

398
00:26:46,204 --> 00:26:47,372
TESTED, QUALITIES IN 

399
00:26:47,372 --> 00:26:48,339
INCREASINGLY SHORT SUPPLY. 

400
00:26:48,339 --> 00:26:50,075
WE SOMETIMES THINK THAT 

401
00:26:50,075 --> 00:26:53,011
POLITICS IS LIFE AND DEATH, BUT 

402
00:26:53,011 --> 00:26:57,148
JOHN MCCAIN KNEW BETTER BECAUSE 

403
00:26:57,148 --> 00:26:59,284
HE HAD ACTUALLY SEEN DEATH AND 

404
00:26:59,284 --> 00:27:00,384
DYING AND TRAGEDY. 

405
00:27:00,384 --> 00:27:03,188
MAKE NO MISTAKE, HE FOUGHT LIKE 

406
00:27:03,188 --> 00:27:05,457
HELL FOR THE CAUSES HE BELIEVED 

407
00:27:05,457 --> 00:27:06,191
IN. 

408
00:27:06,191 --> 00:27:07,459
HE PLOWED THROUGH ELECTION 

409
00:27:07,459 --> 00:27:10,862
AFTER ELECTION WITH THE ENERGY 

410
00:27:10,862 --> 00:27:12,796
AND FOCUS OF A WARRIOR. 

411
00:27:12,796 --> 00:27:16,601
BUT ALONG THE WAY HE DID IT 

412
00:27:16,601 --> 00:27:19,104
WITH HUMOR AND HUMANITY AND 

413
00:27:19,104 --> 00:27:21,406
WITHOUT COMPROMISING THE 

414
00:27:21,406 --> 00:27:25,877
PRINCIPLES HE HELD SO DEAR. 

415
00:27:25,877 --> 00:27:27,278
I'D RATHER LOSE AN ELECTION 

416
00:27:27,278 --> 00:27:33,151
THAN LOSE A WAR, AND WE KNEW HE 

417
00:27:33,151 --> 00:27:34,485
WAS TELLING US THE TRUTH. 

418
00:27:34,485 --> 00:27:37,188
IN THAT WAY JOHN MCCAIN WAS 

419
00:27:37,188 --> 00:27:38,689
ABOUT MORE THAN POLITICS. 

420
00:27:38,689 --> 00:27:39,957
HE BROUGHT US ABOVE POLITICS. 

421
00:27:39,957 --> 00:27:43,161
JOHN IS PROBABLY THE ONLY 

422
00:27:43,161 --> 00:27:44,996
POLITICIAN WHO COULD GET US TO 

423
00:27:44,996 --> 00:27:49,400
SET ASIDE POLITICS AND COME 

424
00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:51,669
TOGETHER AS A STATE AND A 

425
00:27:51,669 --> 00:27:52,703
NATION AS WE HAVE. 

426
00:27:52,703 --> 00:27:56,508
LIKE MANY OF US HERE IN 

427
00:27:56,508 --> 00:27:59,077
ARIZONA, JOHN MCCAIN WAS FROM 

428
00:27:59,077 --> 00:28:01,880
SOMEWHERE ELSE, BUT HIS SPIRIT, 

429
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:02,980
SERVICE AND FIERCE INDEPENDENCE 

430
00:28:02,980 --> 00:28:06,217
ULTIMATELY HELPED SHAPE THE 

431
00:28:06,217 --> 00:28:09,120
STATE WITH WHICH HE BECAME 

432
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:09,420
SYNONYMOUS. 

433
00:28:09,420 --> 00:28:13,258
ALMOST EXACTLY 20 YEARS AGO 

434
00:28:13,258 --> 00:28:16,795
JOHN MCCAIN DELIVERED THE 

435
00:28:16,795 --> 00:28:17,829
EULOGY AT BARRY GOLDWATER'S 

436
00:28:17,829 --> 00:28:19,764
FUNERAL, THAT OTHER GREAT 

437
00:28:19,764 --> 00:28:22,567
LEGENDARY ARIZONAN WHO AMERICA 

438
00:28:22,567 --> 00:28:24,035
HOLDS DEAR IN ITS HEART. 

439
00:28:24,035 --> 00:28:28,173
WHERE BARRY GOLDWATER WAS BORN 

440
00:28:28,173 --> 00:28:33,144
IN ARIZONA JOHN MCCAIN WAS 

441
00:28:33,144 --> 00:28:35,212
ARIZONA'S FAVORITE ADOPTED SON. 

442
00:28:35,212 --> 00:28:37,215
NEARLY 45 YEARS OLD WHEN HE 

443
00:28:37,215 --> 00:28:37,648
MOVED TO ARIZONA. 

444
00:28:37,648 --> 00:28:43,688
THIS IS THE FIRST PLACE HE SAID 

445
00:28:43,688 --> 00:28:45,490
WHERE HE TRULY FOUND A 

446
00:28:45,490 --> 00:28:45,790
CONNECTION. 

447
00:28:45,790 --> 00:28:47,492
ARIZONA HAS ENCHANTED AND 

448
00:28:47,492 --> 00:28:48,492
CLAIMED ME, HE WROTE. 

449
00:28:48,492 --> 00:28:52,630
I LOVE IT SO MUCH, AND I AM SO 

450
00:28:52,630 --> 00:28:55,533
GRATEFUL FOR THE PRIVILEGE OF 

451
00:28:55,533 --> 00:28:56,734
REPRESENTING THE STATE AND ITS 

452
00:28:56,734 --> 00:28:57,035
PEOPLE. 

453
00:28:57,035 --> 00:29:00,872
BUT IN REALITY WE WERE THE ONES 

454
00:29:00,872 --> 00:29:02,073
WHO WERE PRIVILEGED, PRIVILEGED 

455
00:29:02,073 --> 00:29:04,776
TO HAVE JOHN MCCAIN FIGHTING 

456
00:29:04,776 --> 00:29:06,377
FOR US, PRIVILEGED TO LEARN 

457
00:29:06,377 --> 00:29:07,278
FROM HIM, PRIVILEGED THAT WHEN 

458
00:29:07,278 --> 00:29:10,982
HE WAS BACK HOME TO RUN INTO 

459
00:29:10,982 --> 00:29:12,951
HIM AT THE MOVIES OR AT A BALL 

460
00:29:12,951 --> 00:29:14,685
GAME OR AT STARBUCKS. 

461
00:29:14,685 --> 00:29:18,690
JUST LIKE HE WAS ANY ONE OF US, 

462
00:29:18,690 --> 00:29:21,926
PRIVILEGED TO PROUDLY CALL HIM 

463
00:29:21,926 --> 00:29:22,493
A FELLOW ARIZONAN. 

464
00:29:22,493 --> 00:29:25,630
TO THE REST OF THE WORLD JOHN 

465
00:29:25,630 --> 00:29:26,764
MCCAIN WAS ARIZONA. 

466
00:29:26,764 --> 00:29:30,234
WHEN ALL OF US HERE TRAVELED 

467
00:29:30,234 --> 00:29:34,171
AND TOLD PEOPLE WE WERE FROM 

468
00:29:34,171 --> 00:29:37,876
ARIZONA, PEOPLE KNEW TWO BIG 

469
00:29:37,876 --> 00:29:41,112
THINGS ABOUT IT. 

470
00:29:41,112 --> 00:29:42,881
JOHN MCCAIN AND THE GRAND 

471
00:29:42,881 --> 00:29:43,114
CANYON. 

472
00:29:43,114 --> 00:29:45,250
IMAGINING ARIZONA WITHOUT JOHN 

473
00:29:45,250 --> 00:29:50,488
MCCAIN IS LIKE PICTURING AN 

474
00:29:50,488 --> 00:29:51,656
ARIZONA WITHOUT THE GRAND 

475
00:29:51,656 --> 00:29:52,257
CANYON. 

476
00:29:52,257 --> 00:29:53,157
IT'S JUST NOT NATURAL. 

477
00:29:53,157 --> 00:29:57,929
TO THE WOMAN WHO BROUGHT JOHN 

478
00:29:57,929 --> 00:29:58,963
MCCAIN TO ARIZONA, CINDY, THANK 

479
00:29:58,963 --> 00:29:59,163
YOU. 

480
00:29:59,163 --> 00:30:01,299
THE HEARTS AND PRAYERS OF NOT 

481
00:30:01,299 --> 00:30:02,734
ONLY ANGELA AND I, BUT OUR 

482
00:30:02,734 --> 00:30:05,103
ENTIRE STATE AND NATION ARE 

483
00:30:05,103 --> 00:30:08,206
WITH YOU AND YOUR FAMILY AT 

484
00:30:08,206 --> 00:30:08,539
THIS MOMENT. 

485
00:30:08,539 --> 00:30:10,008
ALWAYS KNOWN FOR YOUR ELEGANCE, 

486
00:30:10,008 --> 00:30:12,243
GRACE AND COMPASSION AND THOSE 

487
00:30:12,243 --> 00:30:13,711
QUALITIES HAVE BEEN ON FULL 

488
00:30:13,711 --> 00:30:16,114
DISPLAY THIS PAST YEAR. 

489
00:30:16,114 --> 00:30:24,656
YOU ARE A MODEL FOR US AND AN 

490
00:30:24,656 --> 00:30:24,989
INSPIRATION. 

491
00:30:24,989 --> 00:30:26,424
ARIZONA LOVES YOU, CINDY 

492
00:30:26,424 --> 00:30:26,657
McCAIN. 

493
00:30:26,657 --> 00:30:32,730
TO THE WOMAN THAT BROUGHT JOHN 

494
00:30:32,730 --> 00:30:36,000
MCCAIN INTO THIS WORLD, MRS. 

495
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:37,168
McCAIN, ROBERTA, 106 YEARS 

496
00:30:37,168 --> 00:30:38,503
YOUNG, YOU RAISED A REMARKABLE 

497
00:30:38,503 --> 00:30:40,571
SON, AND WE ARE TRULY BLESSED 

498
00:30:40,571 --> 00:30:42,573
THAT YOU ARE AMONG US STILL. 

499
00:30:42,573 --> 00:30:46,344
WHEN WE LOOK TO YOU, THERE'S NO 

500
00:30:46,344 --> 00:30:48,179
DOUBT WHERE JOHN MCCAIN 

501
00:30:48,179 --> 00:30:51,082
INHERITED HIS DETERMINATION, 

502
00:30:51,082 --> 00:30:51,615
RESILIENCE AND TENACITY. 

503
00:30:51,615 --> 00:30:53,217
IT WAS BUILT INTO HIS DNA. 

504
00:30:53,217 --> 00:30:56,321
YOU SEE IT IN JOHN'S CHILDREN 

505
00:30:56,321 --> 00:31:00,525
WHO CARRY ON HIS SPIRIT OF 

506
00:31:00,525 --> 00:31:03,528
SERVICE, DOUG, ANDY, MEGHAN, 

507
00:31:03,528 --> 00:31:04,662
SIDNEY, JACK, JIMMY AND 

508
00:31:04,662 --> 00:31:04,928
BRIDGEH. 

509
00:31:04,928 --> 00:31:05,930
MAY GOD BLESS YOU AND KEEP ALL 

510
00:31:05,930 --> 00:31:06,197
OF YOU. 

511
00:31:06,197 --> 00:31:10,134
YOUR FATHER WAS VERY PROUD AND 

512
00:31:10,134 --> 00:31:11,536
SO IS THE STATE OF ARIZONA. 

513
00:31:11,536 --> 00:31:13,771
IN MAY ANGELA AND I HAD THE 

514
00:31:13,771 --> 00:31:17,809
GREAT HONOR OF VISITING WITH 

515
00:31:17,809 --> 00:31:19,443
JOHN AND CINDY AT THEIR CABIN. 

516
00:31:19,443 --> 00:31:21,879
BEFORE LUNCH THE SENATOR BROKE 

517
00:31:21,879 --> 00:31:26,050
THE ICE BY SHARING WHAT WAS 

518
00:31:26,050 --> 00:31:28,820
WEIGHING ON HIS MIND MOST OF 

519
00:31:28,820 --> 00:31:29,187
ALL. 

520
00:31:29,187 --> 00:31:32,190
BREAKING INTO A SIGNATURE GRIN 

521
00:31:32,190 --> 00:31:37,261
HE SAID MY BIGGEST CHALLENGE IS 

522
00:31:37,261 --> 00:31:42,367
DECIDING WHETHER OR NOT TO RUN 

523
00:31:42,367 --> 00:31:44,034
FOR RE-ELECTION IN 2022. 

524
00:31:44,034 --> 00:31:47,438
DYING AS HAS BEEN OBSERVED 50 

525
00:31:47,438 --> 00:31:49,140
YEARS EARLIER WAS NOT IN HIS 

526
00:31:49,140 --> 00:31:49,340
PLAN. 

527
00:31:49,340 --> 00:31:52,443
JOHN MCCAIN WAS A FIGHTER, AND 

528
00:31:52,443 --> 00:31:55,212
HE CALLED ON US TO FIGHT WITH 

529
00:31:55,212 --> 00:31:57,315
HIM, FOR AMERICAN VALUES, FOR 

530
00:31:57,315 --> 00:31:59,617
THE IDEALS AND CHARACTER OF A 

531
00:31:59,617 --> 00:32:01,919
FREE PEOPLE, FOR JUSTICE AND 

532
00:32:01,919 --> 00:32:05,423
OPPORTUNITY FOR ALL, FOR EACH 

533
00:32:05,423 --> 00:32:07,424
OTHER AND FOR THIS BLESSED AND 

534
00:32:07,424 --> 00:32:08,458
BOUNTIFUL COUNTRY. 

535
00:32:08,458 --> 00:32:11,229
NONE OF US WERE READY FOR THIS. 

536
00:32:11,229 --> 00:32:13,131
WE NEVER WOULD HAVE BEEN READY 

537
00:32:13,131 --> 00:32:17,335
FOR THIS, BUT JOHN MCCAIN OFTEN 

538
00:32:17,335 --> 00:32:18,469
SAID OF AMERICANS WE NEVER 

539
00:32:18,469 --> 00:32:18,769
SURRENDER. 

540
00:32:18,769 --> 00:32:22,640
SO WHILE WE GRIEVE TODAY AS A 

541
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:25,376
STATE AND AS A NATION, JOHN 

542
00:32:25,376 --> 00:32:27,745
MCCAIN'S FIGHT FOR AMERICA 

543
00:32:27,745 --> 00:32:28,212
ISN'T OVER. 

544
00:32:28,212 --> 00:32:32,016
IT'S A FIGHT ALL AMERICANS ARE 

545
00:32:32,016 --> 00:32:33,351
OBLIGATED TO CONTINUE ON HIS 

546
00:32:33,351 --> 00:32:34,519
BEHALF. 

547
00:32:34,519 --> 00:32:36,421
AND AS WE MARCH FORWARD WITH 

548
00:32:36,421 --> 00:32:39,357

WE ARE EXPECTING THIS TO BE 

619
00:39:38,976 --> 00:39:41,145
JUST THE START OF A FIVE-DAY 

620
00:39:41,145 --> 00:39:44,415
MEMORIAL SERVICE HONORING THE 

621
00:39:44,415 --> 00:39:44,782

WE HEARD SOME INCREDIBLY MOVING 

623
00:39:45,983 --> 00:39:46,317
TRIBUTES. 

624
00:39:46,317 --> 00:39:48,352
IN FACT, GOVERNOR DOUG DUCEY OF

00:39:48,352 --> 00:39:49,520
ARIZONA SAYING THAT ARIZONA 

626
00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:52,022
WITHOUT JOHN MCCAIN IS LIKE 

627
00:39:52,022 --> 00:39:53,924
ARIZONA WITHOUT THE GRAND 

628
00:39:53,924 --> 00:39:55,058
CANYON, IT'S JUST NOT NATURAL. 

629
00:39:55,058 --> 00:39:58,763
I WANT TO BRING IN -- AS WE'RE 

630
00:39:58,763 --> 00:40:00,765

I WANT TO BRING IN CHIEF 

633
00:40:02,165 --> 00:40:02,732
CONGRESSIONAL CORRESPONDENT 

634
00:40:02,732 --> 00:40:04,168
NANCY CORDES WHO'S IN PHOENIX 

635
00:40:04,168 --> 00:40:05,068
AND HAS BEEN THERE OVER THE 

636
00:40:05,068 --> 00:40:06,436
PAST WEEKEND. 

637
00:40:06,436 --> 00:40:09,607
NANCY, I WANTED  TO GET YOUR 

638
00:40:09,607 --> 00:40:10,340
THOUGHTS THIS MOMENT. 

639
00:40:10,340 --> 00:40:12,977
>>REPORTER:  WELL, REENA, THIS 

640
00:40:12,977 --> 00:40:17,081
WAS REALLY A VERY SOLEMN, A 

641
00:40:17,081 --> 00:40:18,249
VERY INTIMATE CEREMONY TO 

642
00:40:18,249 --> 00:40:20,150
REMEMBER JOHN MCCAIN THE 

643
00:40:20,150 --> 00:40:22,086
MILITARY HERO, JOHN MCCAIN THE 

644
00:40:22,086 --> 00:40:24,822
SENATOR, JOHN MCCAIN THE FORMER 

645
00:40:24,822 --> 00:40:25,055
P.O.W. 

646
00:40:25,055 --> 00:40:27,057
THERE WILL BE TIME FOR MORE 

647
00:40:27,057 --> 00:40:28,859
PERSONAL TRIBUTES ABOUT JOHN 

648
00:40:28,859 --> 00:40:30,594
MCCAIN THE MAN, BUT THIS WAS 

649
00:40:30,594 --> 00:40:31,729
REALLY MEANT TO RECOGNIZE HOW 

650
00:40:31,729 --> 00:40:33,597
MUCH HE MEANT TO THIS COUNTRY 

651
00:40:33,597 --> 00:40:35,099
AND TO THIS STATE. 

652
00:40:35,099 --> 00:40:36,433
HE'S ONE OF ONLY A FEW PEOPLE 

653
00:40:36,433 --> 00:40:38,202
IN ARIZONA HISTORY WHO HAVE HAD 

654
00:40:38,202 --> 00:40:40,738
THE HONOR OF LYING IN STATE AS 

655
00:40:40,738 --> 00:40:42,873
HE IS NOW IN THE ARIZONA 

656
00:40:42,873 --> 00:40:43,240
CAPITOL. 

657
00:40:43,240 --> 00:40:44,508
AND THEY SEALED OFF THAT 

658
00:40:44,508 --> 00:40:46,744
ROTUNDA FOR THIS VERY INTIMATE 

659
00:40:46,744 --> 00:40:50,347
SERVICE WITH JUST A HANDFUL OF 

660
00:40:50,347 --> 00:40:51,882
DIGNITARIES AND FAMILY MEMBERS 

661
00:40:51,882 --> 00:40:52,515
AND FRIENDS. 

662
00:40:52,515 --> 00:40:54,285
CLEARLY SOME OF THE FAMILY 

663
00:40:54,285 --> 00:40:56,020
OVERCOME BY EMOTION, AS YOU CAN 

664
00:40:56,020 --> 00:40:56,487
CERTAINLY UNDERSTAND. 

665
00:40:56,487 --> 00:40:59,290
AND I THOUGHT IT WAS REALLY 

666
00:40:59,290 --> 00:41:02,893
NOTABLE THAT ARIZONA'S 

667
00:41:02,893 --> 00:41:03,627
GOVERNOR, DOUG DUCEY, CALLED 

668
00:41:03,627 --> 00:41:04,494
HIM ARIZONA'S FAVORITE ADOPTED 

669
00:41:04,494 --> 00:41:07,664
SON AND NOTED THAT HE WAS 

670
00:41:07,664 --> 00:41:10,267
NEARLY 45 YEARS OLD WHEN McCAIN 

671
00:41:10,267 --> 00:41:11,134
MOVED TO ARIZONA. 

672
00:41:11,134 --> 00:41:12,836
AND WHEN YOU THINK NOW ABOUT 

673
00:41:12,836 --> 00:41:15,406
HOW INTEGRAL HE IS TO THE 

674
00:41:15,406 --> 00:41:18,943
HISTORY OF THIS STATE, IT IS 

675
00:41:18,943 --> 00:41:19,843
REALLY QUITE REMARKABLE. 

676
00:41:19,843 --> 00:41:21,111
AS YOU POINTED OUT, GOVERNOR 

677
00:41:21,111 --> 00:41:22,112
DUCEY SAID THINKING ABOUT 

678
00:41:22,112 --> 00:41:24,381
ARIZONA WITHOUT JOHN MCCAIN IS 

679
00:41:24,381 --> 00:41:27,518
LIKE THINKING ABOUT THE STATE 

680
00:41:27,518 --> 00:41:28,351
WITHOUT THE GRAND CANYON. 

681
00:41:28,351 --> 00:41:29,286
IT'S JUST NOT NATURAL, AND 

682
00:41:29,286 --> 00:41:33,824
THAT'S WHY I THINK IN A COUPLE 

683
00:41:33,824 --> 00:41:37,361
OF HOURS YOU'RE GOING TO SEE AN 

684
00:41:37,361 --> 00:41:38,862
OUTPOURING OF LOCAL RESIDENTS, 

685
00:41:38,862 --> 00:41:40,998
CONSTITUENTS HERE AT THE STATE 

686
00:41:40,998 --> 00:41:41,665
CAPITOL TAKING THAT OPPORTUNITY 

687
00:41:41,665 --> 00:41:45,502
TO FILE IN AND PUT THEIR HAND 

688
00:41:45,502 --> 00:41:46,804
ON THAT CASKET AS YOU'VE SEEN 

689
00:41:46,804 --> 00:41:48,973
FAMILY MEMBERS DOING JUST TO 

690
00:41:48,973 --> 00:41:51,108
PAY THEIR RESPECTS AND THEIR 

691
00:41:51,108 --> 00:41:51,541
LAST REGARDS. 

692
00:41:51,541 --> 00:41:52,375
>> NANCY, AS YOU KNOW, SENATOR 

693
00:41:52,375 --> 00:41:55,112
McCAIN HAS SPENT A GREAT DEAL 

694
00:41:55,112 --> 00:41:55,979
OF TIME LABORING OVER EXACTLY 

695
00:41:55,979 --> 00:41:57,114
WHAT THESE DAYS, THESE NEXT 

696
00:41:57,114 --> 00:41:58,282
FIVE DAYS WOULD LOOK LIKE. 

697
00:41:58,282 --> 00:41:59,883
WHAT DO WE KNOW ABOUT THE 

698
00:41:59,883 --> 00:42:01,852
FUNERAL, WHAT DO WE KNOW ABOUT 

699
00:42:01,852 --> 00:42:03,187
HIS INVOLVEMENT IN PLANNING 

700
00:42:03,187 --> 00:42:03,387
THIS? 

701
00:42:03,387 --> 00:42:05,122
>>REPORTER:  WE KNOW THAT HE 

702
00:42:05,122 --> 00:42:07,391
PLANNED IT AND REPLANNED IT AND 

703
00:42:07,391 --> 00:42:09,860
REPLANNED IT DOWN TO THE LAST 

704
00:42:09,860 --> 00:42:10,694
DETAIL. 

705
00:42:10,694 --> 00:42:13,163
WE KNOW THAT HE MET WITH SOME 

706
00:42:13,163 --> 00:42:14,164
OF HIS CLOSE CONFIDANTES 

707
00:42:14,164 --> 00:42:15,866
REPEATEDLY, ALMOST ON A WEEKLY 

708
00:42:15,866 --> 00:42:19,003
BASIS TO GO OVER SOME OF THE 

709
00:42:19,003 --> 00:42:20,704
DETAILS THAT HE CARED VERY 

710
00:42:20,704 --> 00:42:23,974
DEEPLY ABOUT HIS LEGACY, ABOUT 

711
00:42:23,974 --> 00:42:26,710
HOW HE WOULD BE REMEMBERED AND 

712
00:42:26,710 --> 00:42:28,479
WITH WHAT HE WANTED TO SAY WITH 

713
00:42:28,479 --> 00:42:30,480
THE SERIES OF MEMORIAL 

714
00:42:30,480 --> 00:42:30,747
SERVICES. 

715
00:42:30,747 --> 00:42:31,482
FOR INSTANCE, I THINK IT'S 

716
00:42:31,482 --> 00:42:33,384
NOTABLE THAT TOMORROW YOU WILL 

717
00:42:33,384 --> 00:42:36,687
SEE A GREAT DEAL OF DIVERSITY 

718
00:42:36,687 --> 00:42:39,089
AMONG THE PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN 

719
00:42:39,089 --> 00:42:39,823
CHOSEN TO SPEAK. 

720
00:42:39,823 --> 00:42:40,858
YOU HAVE A FORMER VICE

00:43:08,252 --> 00:43:10,087
SENATOR McCAIN WANTED TO SEND, 

733
00:43:10,087 --> 00:43:11,755
PARTICULARLY IN THESE TURBULENT 

734
00:43:11,755 --> 00:43:15,459
TIMES WHEN YOU HAVE SEEN 

735
00:43:15,459 --> 00:43:17,161
COMMUNITIES RETREATING INTO 

736
00:43:17,161 --> 00:43:19,263
THEIR OWN CAMPS SUSPICION, A 

737
00:43:19,263 --> 00:43:21,031
LOT OF SHARP RHETORIC, FOR 

738
00:43:21,031 --> 00:43:21,865
EXAMPLE, ABOUT IMMIGRATION AND 

739
00:43:21,865 --> 00:43:22,499
ABOUT BUILDING A WALL. 

740
00:43:22,499 --> 00:43:23,767
HE WANTED TO CONVEY, AND YOU 

741
00:43:23,767 --> 00:43:26,003
úH 

742
00:43:26,003 --> 00:43:27,437
THAT WAS READ THE OTHER DAY, 

743
00:43:27,437 --> 00:43:30,674
THAT HE DOESN'T BELIEVE THAT 

744
00:43:30,674 --> 00:43:31,775
THERE SHOULD BE ANY WALLS 

745
00:43:31,775 --> 00:43:32,442
BETWEEN COMMUNITIES. 

746
00:43:32,442 --> 00:43:34,378
AND, IN FACT, HE BELIEVES THAT 

747
00:43:34,378 --> 00:43:35,779
HADS IMPORTANT TO BRING THOSE 

748
00:43:35,779 --> 00:43:36,246
COMMUNITIES TOGETHER. 

749
00:43:36,246 --> 00:43:39,283
SO I THINK THAT IS A THEME THAT 

750
00:43:39,283 --> 00:43:42,820
YOU ARE GOING TO HEAR VERY 

751
00:43:42,820 --> 00:43:44,421
CLEARLY AT THIS MUCH LARGER, 

752
00:43:44,421 --> 00:43:45,289
PROBABLY MORE BOISTEROUS 

753
00:43:45,289 --> 00:43:46,490
MEMORIAL SERVICE HERE IN 

754
00:43:46,490 --> 00:43:47,424
PHOENIX TOMORROW WHERE 

755
00:43:47,424 --> 00:43:49,693
THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE, INCLUDING 

756
00:43:49,693 --> 00:43:51,028
MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC WILL BE 

757
00:43:51,028 --> 00:43:53,263
INVITED IN AND WHERE YOU'VE GOT 

758
00:43:53,263 --> 00:43:55,766
SOME CLOSE FRIENDS WHO SAY 

759
00:43:55,766 --> 00:43:56,800
THAT, YOU KNOW, THEY'VE GOT 

760
00:43:56,800 --> 00:43:58,302
SOME TOUCHING MOMENTS THAT THEY 

761
00:43:58,302 --> 00:44:00,104
WANT TO TALK ABOUT AND SOME 

762
00:44:00,104 --> 00:44:01,972
INAPPROPRIATE MOMENTS THAT THEY 

763
00:44:01,972 --> 00:44:02,572
WANT TO TALK ABOUT BECAUSE 

764
00:44:02,572 --> 00:44:04,675
AFTER ALL WE KNOW THAT JOHN 

765
00:44:04,675 --> 00:44:06,377
MCCAIN WAS A MILITARY HERO, BUT 

766
00:44:06,377 --> 00:44:08,045
HE WAS ALSO SOMEONE WITH A 

767
00:44:08,045 --> 00:44:09,446
SHARP TONGUE AND A GREAT SENSE 

768
00:44:09,446 --> 00:44:10,748
OF HUMOR WHO WAS NOT AFRAID TO 

769
00:44:10,748 --> 00:44:14,818
SHOW IT, BOTH IN PUBLIC AND IN 

770
00:44:14,818 --> 00:44:15,085
PRIVATE. 

771
00:44:15,085 --> 00:44:15,351
>> YEAH. 

772
00:44:15,351 --> 00:44:16,687
WE WERE REMINDED OF THAT JUST 

773
00:44:16,687 --> 00:44:17,621
YESTERDAY BY HIS FRIEND LINDSEY 

774
00:44:17,621 --> 00:44:19,289
GRAHAM OF SOUTH CAROLINA 

775
00:44:19,289 --> 00:44:20,290
TALKING ABOUT HIS HUMOR AND HIS 

776
00:44:20,290 --> 00:44:20,524
JOKES. 

777
00:44:20,524 --> 00:44:22,126
NANCY, I ALSO WANT TO TALK TO 

778
00:44:22,126 --> 00:44:25,395
YOU SORT OF ABOUT -- I THINK 

779
00:44:25,395 --> 00:44:26,964
IT'S SLIGHTLY INCREDIBLE THAT 

780
00:44:26,964 --> 00:44:28,098
HE'S HAVING PRESIDENT BARACK 

781
00:44:28,098 --> 00:44:29,132
OBAMA EULOGIZE HIM, PROBABLY 

782
00:44:29,132 --> 00:44:30,401
ONE OF HIS BIGGEST POLITICAL 

783
00:44:30,401 --> 00:44:32,970
UPSETS OF HIS CAREER, HAVING 

784
00:44:32,970 --> 00:44:34,705
THE MAN WHO HE FACED OFF GIVE 

785
00:44:34,705 --> 00:44:35,105
HIS EULOGY. 

786
00:44:35,105 --> 00:44:35,539
>>REPORTER:  RIGHT. 

787
00:44:35,539 --> 00:44:37,374
AND I THINK THE MESSAGE THAT HE 

788
00:44:37,374 --> 00:44:39,476
WAS TRYING TO SEND THERE BY 

789
00:44:39,476 --> 00:44:41,045
ASKING BOTH BARACK OBAMA AND 

790
00:44:41,045 --> 00:44:43,147
GEORGE W. BUSH WHO DEFEATED HIM 

791
00:44:43,147 --> 00:44:45,783
IN HIS TWO BIDS FOR THE 

792
00:44:45,783 --> 00:44:47,918
PRESIDENCY IS THAT YOU CAN HAVE 

793
00:44:47,918 --> 00:44:49,086
VERY SHARP DISAGREEMENTS WITH 

794
00:44:49,086 --> 00:44:50,154
PEOPLE WITHIN YOUR OWN PARTY, 

795
00:44:50,154 --> 00:44:51,354
WITH THE OTHER PARTY, AND YET 

796
00:44:51,354 --> 00:44:53,023
YOU CAN COME TOGETHER AT THE 

797
00:44:53,023 --> 00:44:54,958
END OF THE DAY FOR THE GOOD OF 

798
00:44:54,958 --> 00:44:55,292
THIS COUNTRY. 

799
00:44:55,292 --> 00:44:56,760
AND THAT IS NOT TO SAY THAT 

800
00:44:56,760 --> 00:44:57,661
JOHN MCCAIN AND BARACK OBAMA 

801
00:44:57,661 --> 00:44:59,429
DIDN'T BUTT HEADS WHEN THEY 

802
00:44:59,429 --> 00:45:00,230
WERE IN THE SENATE OR WHEN 

803
00:45:00,230 --> 00:45:02,332
BARACK OBAMA WAS IN THE WHITE 

804
00:45:02,332 --> 00:45:03,600
HOUSE AND JOHN MCCAIN RETURNED 

805
00:45:03,600 --> 00:45:04,467
TO THE SENATE. 

806
00:45:04,467 --> 00:45:06,437
BUT THEY RESPECTED EACH OTHER 

807
00:45:06,437 --> 00:45:09,539
AS HUMAN BEINGS AND AS PEOPLE. 

808
00:45:09,539 --> 00:45:13,243
AND THERE IS A SENSE WITHIN THE 

809
00:45:13,243 --> 00:45:15,946
McCAIN ORBIT HERE IN ARIZONA OF 

810
00:45:15,946 --> 00:45:18,549
PEOPLE WHO SHARED HIS ETHOS, 

811
00:45:18,549 --> 00:45:19,283
YOU KNOW, SORT OF STAKED OUT 

812
00:45:19,283 --> 00:45:21,151
THE SAME TERRITORY AT THE 

813
00:45:21,151 --> 00:45:22,586
CENTER OF A LOT OF ISSUES ON 

814
00:45:22,586 --> 00:45:24,521
THE POLITICAL SPECTRUM WHO FEEL 

815
00:45:24,521 --> 00:45:26,990
THAT WE HAVE LOST SOME OF THAT, 

816
00:45:26,990 --> 00:45:29,059
THAT POLITICAL DIFFERENCES HAVE 

817
00:45:29,059 --> 00:45:29,859
TURNED INTO PERSONAL 

818
00:45:29,859 --> 00:45:30,193
DIFFERENCES. 

819
00:45:30,193 --> 00:45:32,095
YOU HAVE PEOPLE RETREATING TO 

820
00:45:32,095 --> 00:45:33,564
THEIR CAMPS, NOT SPEAKING TO 

821
00:45:33,564 --> 00:45:33,897
ONE ANOTHER. 

822
00:45:33,897 --> 00:45:35,732
AND SO THE POINT HE'S MAKING BY 

823
00:45:35,732 --> 00:45:36,366
ASKING BARACK OBAMA AND GEORGE 

824
00:45:36,366 --> 00:45:39,970
W. BUSH TO SPEAK IS THAT THEY 

825
00:45:39,970 --> 00:45:41,672
MAY HAVE HAD VERY BITTER POLICY 

826
00:45:41,672 --> 00:45:42,940
DIFFERENCES, BUT THEY RESPECTED 

827
00:45:42,940 --> 00:45:44,074
AND LIKED EACH OTHER AS HUMAN 

828
00:45:44,074 --> 00:45:44,308
BEINGS. 

829
00:45:44,308 --> 00:45:45,142
AND THAT IS SOMETHING THAT'S 

830
00:45:45,142 --> 00:45:47,511
IMPORTANT FOR THE COUNTRY TO 

831
00:45:47,511 --> 00:45:48,245
REMEMBER I THINK. 

832
00:45:48,245 --> 00:45:52,149
>> AND NOT JUST THAT, NANCY, 

833
00:45:52,149 --> 00:45:53,851
WUL OF HIS PALLBEARERS WILL 

834
00:45:53,851 --> 00:45:55,051
ACTUALLY BE A RUSSIA DISDANT. 

835
00:45:55,051 --> 00:45:58,722
WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF THE FACT 

836
00:45:58,722 --> 00:45:59,323
HE'S CHOSEN HIM. 

837
00:45:59,323 --> 00:46:01,458
>>REPORTER:  YOU KNOW, JOHN 

838
00:46:01,458 --> 00:46:04,628
MCCAIN IS SOMEONE WHO TRAVELED 

839
00:46:04,628 --> 00:46:05,261
ALL OVER THE WORLD. 

840
00:46:05,261 --> 00:46:05,962
HE DIDN'T HAVE TO. 

841
00:46:05,962 --> 00:46:07,397
BUT ON MANY CONGRESSIONAL 

842
00:46:07,397 --> 00:46:09,233
BREAKS YOU WOULD FIND HIM 

843
00:46:09,233 --> 00:46:11,902
JETTING OFF TO THE NATION'S HOT 

844
00:46:11,902 --> 00:46:13,136
SPOTS AND TO MEET WITH PEOPLE 

845
00:46:13,136 --> 00:46:14,905
WHO WERE OPPRESSED ALL OVER THE 

846
00:46:14,905 --> 00:46:15,138
WORLD. 

847
00:46:15,138 --> 00:46:16,573
THIS IS SOMETHING THAT HE CARED 

848
00:46:16,573 --> 00:46:18,809
A LOT ABOUT, AND HE KNEW THAT 

849
00:46:18,809 --> 00:46:21,411
HE WAS A SYMBOL OF AMERICAN 

850
00:46:21,411 --> 00:46:22,545
FREEDOM AND THAT HE COULD GIVE 

851
00:46:22,545 --> 00:46:23,413
THOSE PEOPLE HOPE, PARTICULARLY 

852
00:46:23,413 --> 00:46:26,816
BECAUSE OF WHAT HE HAD GONE 

853
00:46:26,816 --> 00:46:28,718
THROUGH AS A PRISONER OF WAR. 

854
00:46:28,718 --> 00:46:29,920
YOU HEARD LINDSEY GRAHAM, HIS 

855
00:46:29,920 --> 00:46:31,121
SENATE WINGMAN, IF YOU WILL, 

856
00:46:31,121 --> 00:46:33,757
THE REPUBLICAN SENATOR FROM 

857
00:46:33,757 --> 00:46:35,192
SOUTH CAROLINA SAY ON THE 

858
00:46:35,192 --> 00:46:36,059
SENATE FLOOR YESTERDAY THAT 

859
00:46:36,059 --> 00:46:37,461
WHEN HE AND McCAIN TRAVELED 

860
00:46:37,461 --> 00:46:41,265
TOGETHER, THEY DIDN'T GO TO 

861
00:46:41,265 --> 00:46:41,632
PARIS OR ROME. 

862
00:46:41,632 --> 00:46:43,834
THEY WENT TO THE HEART OF 

863
00:46:43,834 --> 00:46:44,935
BATTLES ALL OVER THE WORLD. 

864
00:46:44,935 --> 00:46:48,171
THEY WENT TO IRAQ AND 

865
00:46:48,171 --> 00:46:51,441
AFGHANISTAN, THEY WENT TO THE 

866
00:46:51,441 --> 00:46:52,342
BALKANS. 

867
00:46:52,342 --> 00:46:54,845
THEY WENT TO DIFFICULT PLACES 

868
00:46:54,845 --> 00:46:56,547
WHERE PEOPLE WERE CLASHING AND 

869
00:46:56,547 --> 00:46:57,747
MET WITH LEADERS AND CITIZENS 

870
00:46:57,747 --> 00:46:59,983
ALIKE AND TRIED TO GIVE THEM 

871
00:46:59,983 --> 00:47:03,720
HOPE AND TRIED TO CONVEY TO 

872
00:47:03,720 --> 00:47:05,255
THEM THAT AMERICA CARED ABOUT 

873
00:47:05,255 --> 00:47:06,156
THEIR STRUGGLES. 

874
00:47:06,156 --> 00:47:08,792
AND THIS IS A PART OF McCAIN'S 

875
00:47:08,792 --> 00:47:10,126
LEGACY THAT I THINK WAS 

876
00:47:10,126 --> 00:47:10,927
INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT TO HIM. 

877
00:47:10,927 --> 00:47:12,996
I THINK YOU'LL HEAR JOE BIDEN 

878
00:47:12,996 --> 00:47:14,464
TALK ABOUT THAT A BIT TOMORROW 

879
00:47:14,464 --> 00:47:17,567
BECAUSE HE WAS IN A LOT OF 

880
00:47:17,567 --> 00:47:19,269
THOSE FOX HOLES WITH McCAIN AND 

881
00:47:19,269 --> 00:47:22,038
TRAVELED ALL OVER THE WORLD 

882
00:47:22,038 --> 00:47:22,639
WITH HIM. 

883
00:47:22,639 --> 00:47:23,773
>> YEAH, THAT'S RIGHT. 

884
00:47:23,773 --> 00:47:27,244
I REMEMBER THE ACTUALLY THE TWO 

885
00:47:27,244 --> 00:47:28,345
OF THEM SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM 

886
00:47:28,345 --> 00:47:31,248
AND SENATOR McCAIN COMING TO 

887
00:47:31,248 --> 00:47:33,317
ISRAELI AND TRYING TO PUSH A 

888
00:47:33,317 --> 00:47:33,750
TWO-STATE SOLUTION. 

889
00:47:33,750 --> 00:47:35,452
I REMEMBER ONE ISRAELI SAY WE 

890
00:47:35,452 --> 00:47:37,154
DON'T LIKE THE MESSAGE THEY'RE 

891
00:47:37,154 --> 00:47:39,089
BRINGING, BUT WE RESPECT THEIR 

892
00:47:39,089 --> 00:47:39,656
SERVICE AND THEIR TIME IN 

893
00:47:39,656 --> 00:47:39,889
OFFICE. 

894
00:47:39,889 --> 00:47:40,290
GO AHEAD, NANCY. 

895
00:47:40,290 --> 00:47:42,059
>>REPORTER:  I THINK IT'S 

896
00:47:42,059 --> 00:47:43,694
IMPORTANT TO NOTE ONE OTHER 

897
00:47:43,694 --> 00:47:45,462
THING WHICH THAT McCAIN HAS 

898
00:47:45,462 --> 00:47:47,731
BEEN IN CONGRESS FOR NEARLY 35 

899
00:47:47,731 --> 00:47:49,766
YEARS, AND THAT'S HOW WE THINK 

900
00:47:49,766 --> 00:47:50,233
OF HIM. 

901
00:47:50,233 --> 00:47:52,302
AND OF COURSE WE RECALL HIS 

902
00:47:52,302 --> 00:47:58,775
EXPERIENCE AS A PRISONER OF 

903
00:47:58,775 --> 00:47:59,109
WAR. 

904
00:47:59,109 --> 00:48:00,410
BUT HE WAS ALSO THE NAVY'S 

905
00:48:00,410 --> 00:48:02,712
ATTACHE TO THE CONGRESS FOR 

906
00:48:02,712 --> 00:48:03,746
YEARS AFTER HE WAS RELEASED. 

907
00:48:03,746 --> 00:48:05,182
SO HE KEPT HIS AFFILIATION WITH 

908
00:48:05,182 --> 00:48:06,950
THE NAVY EVEN AFTER HE LEFT. 

909
00:48:06,950 --> 00:48:07,550
HE DIDN'T HAVE TO. 

910
00:48:07,550 --> 00:48:09,686
THIS WAS SOMETHING THAT WAS 

911
00:48:09,686 --> 00:48:10,720
STILL VERY IMPORTANT TO HIM. 

912
00:48:10,720 --> 00:48:11,955
HE SERVED ON THE ARMED SERVICES 

913
00:48:11,955 --> 00:48:12,655
