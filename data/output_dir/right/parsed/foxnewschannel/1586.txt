HANDLE THE TRUMP INVESTIGATION
BUT THE CLINTON INVESTIGATION AS
>> Martha: AS YOU SAY, MAYBE
JUST A FEW DAYS AWAY.
GREAT TO SEE YOU TONIGHT.
NOW TO MY EXCLUSIVE INTERVIEW
WITH THE VICE PRESIDENT STARTING
WITH THAT MEETING AT THE
WHITE HOUSE.
>> Martha: I KNOW YOU JUST
CAME FROM LUNCH WITH THE
PRESIDENT AT THE WHITE HOUSE AND
HE HAS ANOTHER MEETING COMING UP
THIS AFTERNOON WITH ROD
ROSENSTEIN AND CHRISTOPHER WRAY.
WHAT DO YOU EXPECT WILL HAPPEN
THERE, DO YOU HAVE ANY INSIGHT
TO THAT?
>> WITH THE REVELATIONS THAT
ARMY CAMPAIGN MAY HAVE BEEN THE
SUBJECT OF SURVEILLANCE BY THE
FBI, THE PRESIDENT I THINK IS
GRATEFUL THAT THE DEPARTMENT OF
JUSTICE IS GOING TO HAVE THE
INSPECTOR GENERAL LOOK INTO IT
AND DETERMINE AND ENSURE THAT
THERE WAS NO SURVEILLANCE DONE
FOR POLITICAL PURPOSES AGAINST
OUR CAMPAIGN.
I THINK IT WOULD BE VERY
TROUBLING TO MILLIONS OF
AMERICANS IF THAT TOOK PLACE,
BUT WE ARE VERY CONFIDENT THAT
AS THE INSPECTOR GENERAL HAS
BEEN DOING THEIR WORK, LOOKING
AT THE CONDUCT OF THE FBI DURING
THAT PERIOD, BY ADDING THEIR
FOCUS TO THIS THAT WE WILL GET
TO THE BOTTOM OF IT BECAUSE THE
AMERICAN PEOPLE HAVE A RIGHT TO
KNOW.
>> Martha: IS THERE ANY
SUGGESTION THAT THERE WILL BE A
SECOND SPECIAL COUNSEL THAT
WOULD BE DEDICATED TO THAT
ENDEAVOR?
>> I THINK AT THIS POINT THE
DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE HAS MADE
IT CLEAR THAT THEY WILL BE
EXPANDING INSPECTOR GENERAL'S
CURRENT INVESTIGATION TO INCLUDE
THESE ALLEGATIONS AND WE DON'T
KNOW WHAT HAPPENED.
WE READ THE PRESS REPORTS BUT
IT'S ALL VERY TROUBLING.
IT'S ALL VERY TROUBLING TO THOSE
OF US THAT HOLD THE FBI IN SUCH
HIGH REGARD THAT THERE ARE EVEN
ALLEGATIONS THAT PEOPLE WERE
ASSIGNED TO SURVEILLED OR EVEN
SPY ON OUR CAMPAIGN.
BUT LOOK, THE INSPECTOR GENERAL
HAS THE RESOURCES TO GET TO THE
BOTTOM OF IT.
HE'S BEEN WORKING ON A MAJOR
REPORT ABOUT THE FBI'S CONDUCT
AND BY EXPANDING INTO THIS ROLE
WE ARE VERY CONFIDENT THAT WE
WILL GET TO THE BOTTOM OF IT, WE
WILL FIND OUT WHAT HAPPENED AND
THE AMERICAN PEOPLE AND ALL OF
US WILL HAVE THE FACTS.
>> Martha: OBVIOUSLY ON THE
HILL THEY'VE BEEN VERY
FRUSTRATED WITH THE INFORMATION
THAT THEY'VE BEEN GETTING FROM
THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE.
THE PRESIDENT HAS THE ABILITY TO
DECLASSIFY THOSE REPORTS SO THAT
THEY COME THROUGH UNREDACTED SO
THAT THERE'S BETTER
TRANSPARENCY.
WILL HE DO THAT?
>> PRESIDENT TRUMP REALLY
BELIEVES THAT IT'S IMPORTANT
THAT WE PROVIDE THE ACCOUNTABLE
COMMITTEES ON CAPITOL HILL WITH
ALL THE INFORMATION THAT IS
NECESSARY TO DO THEIR WORK.
AND I KNOW THAT THE DEPARTMENT
OF JUSTICE HAS ASSIGNED
ADDITIONAL PERSONNEL TO FOCUS ON
THAT, TO WORK THROUGH THOSE
DOCUMENTS AND THAT INFORMATION
AND WE WILL CONTINUE TO LOOK
FORWARD TO THEM PROVIDING
INFORMATION.
>> Martha: MATT GATES SAYING
THE PRESIDENT MUST DECLASSIFY
THOSE DOCUMENTS.
HE HAS THE AUTHORITY TO DO SO.
DO YOU BELIEVE HE WILL?
>> IT WILL BE THE PRESIDENT'S
DECISION TO DETERMINE WHAT ED
CLASSIFIES AND WHAT HE DOESN'T,
BUT THE PRINCIPLE HERE THAT THE
AMERICAN PEOPLE HAVE A RIGHT TO
KNOW WHAT HAPPENED, THE PEOPLE'S
CONGRESS OUGHT TO HAVE THE
ABILITY TO REVIEW THOSE
MATERIALS IN A TIMELY WAY IS A
PRINCIPLE WE ADHERE TO IN THIS
WHITE HOUSE.
>> Martha: ONE OF THE PUNDITS
ON THE SUNDAY SHOWS SAID THIS IS
BECOMING A BLUE-RED FIGHT AND
THAT THE PRESIDENT LIKES IT THAT
WAY.
DO YOU THINK THAT'S TRUE?
>> NO.
I THINK THE AMERICAN PEOPLE, THE
AMERICAN PEOPLE UNDERSTAND THAT
WHEN IT COMES TO THE DEPARTMENT
OF JUSTICE, WHEN IT COMES TO THE
FBI, THAT WE HAVE THOUSANDS OF
MEN AND WOMEN WHO EACH AND EVERY
DAY ARE DEDICATED TO ENFORCING
THE LAWS AND PROTECTING OUR
FAMILIES AND PROTECTING OUR
COUNTRY.
BUT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ALSO
HAVE A SENSE THAT WE ALL DO THAT
THINGS WENT AWRY IN 2016 AND WE
NEED TO KNOW WHAT HAPPENED.
WE NEED TO GET TO THE BOTTOM OF
THE FACTS.
>> Martha: YOU GOT SOME HEAT
WHEN YOU WENT ON SOME OF THE
SUNDAY SHOWS FOR SAYING THAT
THEY COMPARED YOUR COMMENTS TO
RICHARD NIXON SAYING THAT ALL
THE DOCUMENTS HAD BEEN GIVEN AND
THAT HE NEEDS TO BE WRAPPED UP.
WHAT DO YOU SAY TO THAT, AND
ALSO NOW RUDY GIULIANI IS SAYING
HE BELIEVES IT WILL BE WRAPPED
UP ON SEPTEMBER 1ST?
>> I WAS ASKED WHAT I THOUGHT OF
THE INVESTIGATION.
I SAID THAT WE HAVE FULLY
COOPERATED IN THIS
INVESTIGATION.
AS I SAID, OVER A MILLION
DOCUMENTS HAVE BEEN PROVIDED AND
I JUST SAID FOR THE SAKE OF THE
COUNTRY, AND I THINK IT'S TIME
THAT THE SPECIAL COUNSEL WRAP IT
UP AND I THINK THAT'S PROBABLY
AN OPINION WIDELY SHARED BY
PEOPLE ALL ACROSS AMERICA, THE
TRUTH IS IT'S BEEN NOW MORE THAN
A YEAR.
THE SPECIAL COUNSEL HAS A TEAM
AROUND THEM THAT HAS BEEN
LOOKING INTO ALL OF THE
ALLEGATIONS HERE AND WITH THE
FULL COOPERATION OF THE
WHITE HOUSE THEY HAVE BEEN ABLE
TO ASSEMBLE THE FACTS AND I
CONTINUE TO HOPE AND TO SAY VERY
RESPECTFULLY THAT THE SPECIAL
COUNSEL OUGHT TO, WITH ALL
DELIBERATE MEANS, COMPLETE THEIR
WORK AND PROVIDE THE INFORMATION
TO THEIR LEADERSHIP OF THE
DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE THAT WILL
COME FROM THIS INVESTIGATION SO
THAT WE CAN JUST SIMPLY MOVE ON
AS A COUNTRY.
>> Martha: LET'S TURN TO SOME
OF THAT PROGRESS.
NORTH KOREA, A MEETING TOMORROW
WITH THE LEADER OF SOUTH KOREA,
PRESIDENT MOON, WILL HAPPEN.
IS THIS MOMENT WITH NORTH KOREA
ON JUNE 12TH GOING TO HAPPEN?
>> AS THE PRESIDENT OFTEN SAYS,
MARTHA, WE WILL SEE.
WHAT I CAN TELL YOU IS THAT FROM
THE EARLY DAYS OF THIS
ADMINISTRATION PRESIDENT TRUMP
MADE IT CLEAR THAT THIS TIME, IN
THIS ADMINISTRATION IT WOULD BE
DIFFERENT FROM PRIOR
ADMINISTRATIONS WERE NORTH KOREA
FOUND A WAY TO GET CONCESSIONS
FROM THE UNITED STATES AND FROM
COUNTRIES IN THE WEST IN
EXCHANGE FOR ILLUSORY PROMISES
ABOUT ABANDONING THEIR NUCLEAR
WEAPONS PROGRAM.
PRESIDENT TRUMP FROM EARLY ON
INITIATED WHAT WE CALL THE
EXTREME PRESSURE CAMPAIGN.
HE MARSHALED THE RESOURCES OF
THE WORLD COMMUNITY TO BRING
ECONOMIC AND DIPLOMATIC PRESSURE
WHILE KEEPING ALL OPTIONS ON THE
TABLE TO ACHIEVE THE OBJECTIVE
OF A NUCLEAR-FREE KOREAN
PENINSULA.
WE HAVE STAYED ON THAT PRESENT
COURSE, WE HAVE NEVER WAVERED
FROM IT.
BUT WHEN KIM JONG UN THREW THE
SOUTH KOREANS REACHED OUT AND
SAID HE HE WOULD SUSPEND HIS
NUCLEAR TESTING, SUSPEND HIS
BALLISTIC TESTING AND BE WILLING
TO ACHIEVE COMPLETE
DENUCLEARIZATION THROUGH TALKS
IN EXCHANGE FOR A MEETING WITH
PRESIDENT TRUMP, THIS PRESIDENT
READILY SAID YES.
THEY ASKED FOR THE MEETING AND
WE CONTINUE TO BE OPEN TO IT,
BUT REST ASSURED THAT THE
UNITED STATES WILL CONTINUE ON
THE PATH THAT WE ARE ON BECAUSE
THIS PRESIDENT HAS MADE IT CLEAR
THAT WE WILL NOT TOLERATE
NORTH KOREA POSSESSING NUCLEAR
WEAPONS AND BALLISTIC MISSILES
THAT THREATEN THE UNITED STATES
AND OUR ALLIES.
>> Martha: IS THAT PROCESS OF
DENUCLEARIZATION SOMETHING THAT
COULD HAPPEN OVER TIME IN STAGES
COULD HAPPEN OVER TIME IN STAGE
STAGES?
>> WITH THE PRESIDENT HAS MADE
CLEAR IS THAT WE NEED COMPLETE
AND VERIFIABLE AND IRREVERSIBLE
DENUCLEARIZATION AND THERE'S
OPPORTUNITIES AND BENEFITS FOR
NORTH KOREA ONCE WE REACH THAT
POINT OF NO RETURN.
ONCE WE REACH THE POINT WHERE AS
THEY DISMANTLE THEIR NUCLEAR
WEAPONS PROGRAM WITH PROPER
VERIFICATION AND FULL
TRANSPARENCY THAT THEN
PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS ALREADY
ORGANIZED SUPPORT FROM JAPAN,
FROM SOUTH KOREA, FROM OTHER
NATIONS IN THE REGION INCLUDING
CHINA TO ORGANIZE THE RESOURCES
THAT WOULD CREATE A BRIGHTER
FUTURE FOR THE KIM REGIME, A
BRIGHTER FUTURE MORE IMPORTANTLY
FOR THE PEOPLE OF NORTH KOREA,
BUT IT ALL BEGINS WITH
NORTH KOREA COMMITTING TO
COMPLETE DENUCLEARIZATION,
TAKING CONCRETE STEPS TO ACHIEVE
THAT.
>> Martha: WHEN YOU CAME OUT
OF LUNCH TODAY WITH THE
PRESIDENT, WAS IT YOUR FEELING,
I THINK THE SUMMIT IS GOING TO
HAPPEN IN JUNE?
>> LIKE I SAID, I THINK THAT IN
OUR DISCUSSIONS WITH LEADERS IN
THE CONGRESS, THE PRESIDENT
SPOKE WITH PRESIDENT MOON THIS
WEEKEND WHOM WE WELCOME TO THE
WHITE HOUSE TOMORROW.
OUR POSTURE IS WE CONTINUE TO BE
OPEN.
WE CONTINUE TO BE OPEN TO
ACHIEVING DENUCLEARIZATION ON
THE KOREAN PENINSULA BY
PEACEABLE MEANS.
>> Martha: THERE ARE SOME
REPORTS THAT THE PRESIDENT IS
CONCERNED THAT IF IT FAILS OR IT
DOESN'T GO WELL IT COULD BE VERY
EMBARRASSING TO HAVE GONE THIS
FAR DOWN THE ROAD AND THAT HE IS
SEEKING INPUT AS TO WHETHER OR
NOT HE SHOULD MAYBE RETHINK THIS
WHOLE THING.
>> I FELT        I DON'T THINK P
>> I FELT        I DON'T THINK E
>> I FELT        I DON'T THINK I
>> I FELT        I DON'T THINK E
>> I FELT        I DON'T THINK T
>> I FELT        I DON'T THINK U
>> I FELT        I DON'T THINK P
IS THINKING ABOUT PUBLIC
RELATIONS.
HE'S THINKING ABOUT HOW WE
ACHIEVE WHAT HAS ELUDED
SUCCESSIVE AMERICAN
ADMINISTRATIONS.
TRUTHFULLY, THE CLINTON
ADMINISTRATION, EVEN THE BUSH
ADMINISTRATION GOT PLAYED IN THE
PAST.
WE OFFERED CONCESSIONS TO THE
NORTH KOREAN REGIME IN EXCHANGE
FOR PROMISES TO END THEIR
NUCLEAR WEAPONS PROGRAMS ONLY TO
SEE THEM BREAK THOSE PROMISES
AND ABANDON THEM.
IT WOULD BE A GREAT MISTAKE FOR
KIM JONG UN TO THINK HE COULD
PLAY DONALD TRUMP.
>> Martha: CLEARLY THE
PRESIDENT IS STILL WILLING TO
WALK AWAY.
>> THERE'S NO QUESTION, BUT WE
HOPE FOR BETTER.
WE REALLY HOPE THAT KIM JONG UN
WILL SEIZE THE OPPORTUNITY TO
DISMANTLE HIS NUCLEAR WEAPONS
PROGRAM AND DO SO BY PEACEABLE
MEANS.
THERE WAS SOME TALK ABOUT THE
LIBYA MODEL LAST WEEK AND AS THE
PRESIDENT MADE CLEAR, THIS WILL
ONLY END LIKE THE LIBYA MODEL
ENDED IF KIM JONG UN DOESN'T
MAKE A DEAL.
>> Martha: SOME PEOPLE SAW
THAT AS A THREAT.
>> I THINK IT'S MORE OF A FACT.
PRESIDENT TRUMP MADE IT CLEAR
THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA
UNDER HIS LEADERSHIP IS NOT
GOING TO TOLERATE THE REGIME IN
NORTH KOREA POSSESSING NUCLEAR
WEAPONS AND BALLISTIC MISSILES
THAT THREATEN THE UNITED STATES
AND OUR ALLIES.
WE'VE MADE IT CLEAR THAT WE ARE
CONTINUING TO BRING ECONOMIC AND
DIPLOMATIC PRESSURE TO BEAR ON
NORTH KOREA THAT ALL OPTIONS ARE
ON THE TABLE TO ACHIEVE THAT
END, BUT THAT BEING SAID, WE'VE
SEEN GREAT PROGRESS IN RECENT
MONTHS.
LAST MONTH'S INTER-KOREAN SUMMIT
WHERE YOU SAW THE LEADERS OF
NORTH AND SOUTH MEET AT THE BLUE
HOUSE, HAVE THAT DISCUSSION.
THE REALITY IS THAT WE HOPE FOR
A PEACEABLE SOLUTION.
THE PRESIDENT REMAINS OPEN TO A
SUMMIT TAKING PLACE AND WILL
CONTINUE TO PURSUE THAT PATH
EVEN WHILE WE STAND STRONG ON
THE OBJECTIVE OF
DENUCLEARIZATION IN THE EXTREME
PRESSURE CAMPAIGN THAT IS
UNDERWAY TODAY.
>> Martha: IF IT DOESN'T
HAPPEN, THE MILITARY OPTION IS
BASICALLY BACK ON THE TABLE.
>> WELL, IT NEVER CAME OFF,
MARTHA.
THE TRUTH IS THAT
PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS MADE IT
CLEAR THAT THIS ADMINISTRATION
WILL NOT TOLERATE THE REGIME IN
NORTH KOREA POSSESSING NUCLEAR
WEAPONS AND BALLISTIC MISSILES
THAT THREATEN OUR PEOPLE, THAT
THREATEN THE UNITED STATES OF
AMERICA, THAT THREATEN OUR
ALLIES IN THE REGION.
WE WILL CONTINUE TO BE OPEN TO
