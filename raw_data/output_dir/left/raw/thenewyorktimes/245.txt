1
00:00:01,980 --> 00:00:05,100
All cybersecurity experts who
have given electronic voting

2
00:00:05,100 --> 00:00:07,970
machines any thought
agree.

3
00:00:07,970 --> 00:00:10,210
These machines have got to go.

4
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:13,660
To show you why, I’m running a mock
election

5
00:00:13,710 --> 00:00:18,750
using the same dangerous and obsolete
machines still in use today.

6
00:00:18,750 --> 00:00:20,970
Our election will find out
whether Michigan students

7
00:00:20,970 --> 00:00:25,760
prefer their own university
or our arch rival Ohio State.

8
00:00:27,140 --> 00:00:28,140
Here we are.

9
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:31,580
After the chaos of
the 2000 election,

10
00:00:31,580 --> 00:00:35,250
we were promised a modern
and dependable way to vote.

11
00:00:36,940 --> 00:00:40,360
I’m here to tell you that the
electronic voting machines

12
00:00:40,360 --> 00:00:43,480
Americans got to solve the
problem of voting integrity —

13
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:46,330
they turned out to
be an awful idea.

14
00:00:46,650 --> 00:00:47,650
One vote for McCain.

15
00:00:47,650 --> 00:00:48,580
Huh?!

16
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:53,950
That’s because people like me
can hack them all too easily.

17
00:00:53,950 --> 00:00:57,820
I’m a computer scientist who has
hacked a lot of electronic voting

18
00:00:57,820 --> 00:00:58,930
machines.

19
00:00:58,930 --> 00:01:02,020
I even turned one machine
into a video game console.

20
00:01:02,020 --> 00:01:05,170
Imagine what the Russians
and North Koreans can do.

21
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:08,540
I’ve even gone to Congress
to raise the alarm.

22
00:01:08,550 --> 00:01:11,500
Our highly computerized election
infrastructure

23
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:15,790
is vulnerable to sabotage
and even to cyber-attacks

24
00:01:18,310 --> 00:01:20,590
This is the same
electronic voting machine

25
00:01:20,590 --> 00:01:24,070
used in Georgia and parts
of Indiana, Kansas, Kentucky

26
00:01:24,070 --> 00:01:27,400
Mississippi, Tennessee, Texas
and even in swing states

27
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:30,280
like Virginia, Florida
and Pennsylvania.

28
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:33,790
Millions of Americans voted
on paperless electronic voting

29
00:01:33,790 --> 00:01:36,170
machines in the 2016 election.

30
00:01:36,170 --> 00:01:37,080
Who are you going to vote for?

31
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:39,010
Hundred percent Michigan.

32
00:01:39,010 --> 00:01:40,010
Obviously Michigan.

33
00:01:40,010 --> 00:01:42,010
Michigan.

34
00:01:42,010 --> 00:01:44,980
But here’s a little
secret between you and me.

35
00:01:44,980 --> 00:01:47,900
I’ve already hacked these worthless
machines.

36
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:51,340
Step one: buy a voting machine on Ebay.

37
00:01:51,340 --> 00:01:53,590
Or, if you are the
North Koreans, hack

38
00:01:53,590 --> 00:01:56,480
the manufacturer and
steal their software code.

39
00:01:57,020 --> 00:01:59,740
Step two: write a virus.

40
00:01:59,740 --> 00:02:03,040
Step three: email your virus
to every election official

41
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:04,840
responsible for
programming the voting

42
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:06,700
machines with new ballots.

43
00:02:06,700 --> 00:02:09,880
Many of these officials
are easy to find online.

44
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:12,240
Step four: sip coffee
and wait.

45
00:02:14,090 --> 00:02:17,080
Step five: hijack the
ballot programming

46
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:18,900
and let the election
officials copy

47
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:22,730
your invisible malicious code
onto the voting machines.

48
00:02:23,710 --> 00:02:24,900
Step six:

49
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:27,380
watch your code
silently steal votes.

50
00:02:32,550 --> 00:02:35,020
All right, here are the results
from the electronic voting

51
00:02:35,020 --> 00:02:36,580
machines.

52
00:02:36,580 --> 00:02:39,670
Ohio State wins 131 to 108.

53
00:02:43,510 --> 00:02:44,820
There’s a good reason

54
00:02:44,820 --> 00:02:46,850
we computer scientists
are paranoid.

55
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:49,120
It’s a golden age for hackers.

56
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:51,020
The computer virus
that destroyed

57
00:02:51,020 --> 00:02:52,020
Iranian nuclear equipment —

58
00:02:52,380 --> 00:02:53,890
This is one of the largest data

59
00:02:53,890 --> 00:02:55,120
breaches in history.

60
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:58,270
More than one billion
of its accounts were hacked.

61
00:02:58,270 --> 00:03:01,300
What chance do the people
running your local elections

62
00:03:01,300 --> 00:03:04,130
really have against
Russia or North Korea?

63
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:07,370
OK, everyone.

64
00:03:07,370 --> 00:03:09,720
I hacked the voting machines.

65
00:03:10,690 --> 00:03:12,860
I do have the real
results,

66
00:03:13,070 --> 00:03:16,050
because we also counted on paper.

67
00:03:17,330 --> 00:03:18,780
Michigan wins!

68
00:03:19,970 --> 00:03:22,080
Michigan won in a landslide.

69
00:03:22,340 --> 00:03:26,060
And I can say this confidently
because I have the real results

70
00:03:26,060 --> 00:03:28,570
from the safest and
simplest solution.

71
00:03:29,030 --> 00:03:29,881
Paper ballots.

72
00:03:33,110 --> 00:03:35,750
We need to take a hard look
at the equipment that actually

73
00:03:35,750 --> 00:03:37,560
records and reports votes.

74
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:38,990
Even though the Senate intelligence

75
00:03:38,990 --> 00:03:41,420
committee is finally
showing some understanding

76
00:03:41,420 --> 00:03:42,200
of the problem,

77
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:43,490
it’s not enough.

78
00:03:43,490 --> 00:03:46,050
All states in this
country, the people

79
00:03:46,050 --> 00:03:48,410
ultimately responsible
for how we vote,

80
00:03:50,460 --> 00:03:52,730
In a real election,
an official could quickly

81
00:03:52,730 --> 00:03:54,440
scan these paper ballots

82
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:58,220
and shortly after, have a
human verify the results.

83
00:03:58,220 --> 00:04:01,840
Paper plus audits: all elections
should be run this way.

84
00:04:02,090 --> 00:04:05,540
But if you don’t want to believe
me or every single expert

85
00:04:05,540 --> 00:04:08,580
in cybersecurity who’s
thought this through,

86
00:04:08,580 --> 00:04:09,870
then take it from this guy.

87
00:04:10,010 --> 00:04:12,020
It’s old fashioned,
but it’s always

88
00:04:12,020 --> 00:04:15,670
good to have a paper
backup system of voting.

89
00:04:15,950 --> 00:00:00,000
It’s called paper.
