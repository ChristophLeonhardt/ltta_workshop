Greenwich Council decided to remove an unofficial memorial for Lee Rigby I sound official because at the location when Lee was murdered there is no memorial they've actually refused to put the memorial it seems as though they want levy B's name to be forgotten they don't want anyone to know he was murdered in that location they want his death kicked into the long grass so we decided to go and bring some flowers back there and put some flowers there in respect of Lee Rigby I read the council statement and the reasons they've given and the reasons they gave for why they removed the memorial was because local residents in the flats next to it didn't want them and because it's next to a school so I went to speak to local residents and went to speak to people at the school so what they had to say I would say living in the day when it happened so have you met anyone else in the block that has a problem now so you haven't met any residents in this block where you live that have a problem with their being remembered sing they're just there for a reason and they should let it be so do you think that maybe this would be solved if the council just put a proper memorial to leave me be here I think that would be the best idea where they put it up the other end it's not appropriate yeah it's good to come all right sounds good to memory yeah I think they might complain about that so I'm gonna fly exploring but that's the only thing nobody really reminds it minds about it do you have a problem of it because I'm ex-army but when you say it must be when you say when you say it must be because from the council so much you get a improve it what does the letter from the council say that they're going to ask if we would like these flags moved why actually turn out was that the council were touting for a reason to remove it the council sent letters to all the residents saying do you want us to remove it people won't complain him wanting it removed the council touted to find a reason to remove it dear residents the council has been contact by a number of residents in relation to the flags flowers and photographs have been attached to the railings around Ellison house we understand that Lee's tragic murder remains an emotive issue that is why the council supported the installation of a plaque the council boid the insulator of a plaque in sand George's Chapel it's not good enough there should be a remembrance part here where he was murdered a lot of people putting this down to the fact that we couldn't offend Muslims and that Muslims wouldn't want it there I don't think that's actually the case at all I think this decisions been made by far left left-wing people within the council and it's got nothing to do the Muslim community in fact I don't think any of the Muslim community would mind there being a memorial for Lee Rigby would you be happy for there to be a memorial for leaving do you think there should be a permanent as a local person cuz there's no permanent remembrance thing here from you a plaque yeah just don't move that and then it does a wave of all people feeling the need to do it themselves I agree here's some footage taken by a pastor boy who was angry who saw council employees at 5 o'clock in the morning removing Lee Booby's memorial three days after we laid off flowers we went back to examining whether any other members of the British public had been there to lay support or show support for Lee Rigby it's very clear you can see it's very clear that the British public want somewhere they want a memorial site when someone dies they get a headstone they get a headstone so their loved ones can go and sit there and mourn them and feel like they're there with them now leave me be was it was a son to his mother and father it was a son to Britain when he was killed that was a death that affected our whole nation and the British public want some ways and that there is a memorial up in Lee Lee's home town of Midland that's his family's memorial the general public that probably don't want to be visiting up there or all or one before the family one that want them visiting there they want somewhere where they can go and show respect and have a moment to think and remember leave me be it's clear as day that's what's happening and the fact that Greenwich Council blocking is just unbelievable four and a half years on in fact that we're even talking about this and the need through this is some something that's not gonna go away people are not going to forget Lee Rigby Greenwich Council no matter how much you want this to go away I'm a how much you never want to hear that name Lee Rigby again it's never gonna attack going to happen the bridge public demand a memorial if you want to solve this problem just put a memorial at the site so people go and pay respects to it you
