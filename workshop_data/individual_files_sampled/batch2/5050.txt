first we must go to Hong Kong to the tweet desk willie geist is standing by hope there's not a delay Billy I think clean feed this morning I just wanted to add I wanted to add a point to what you just said you always look at the right reason here's it off your Newt Gingrich comments yeah here's a tweet from eleven months ago from Newt Gingrich he writes this this is a quote robert muller is a superb choice to be special counsel Oh his reputation is impeccable for honesty and integrity media should now calm down so what makes the whole thing worse which you just explained is that he knows better Newt Gingrich knows are we still doing this thank you yeah is that Newt Gingrich knows better from he knows he knows who Bob Muller is he knows that he's a man of integrity he said he was a man of integrity so now he's going to compare him to the Gestapo his investigation where he passed information along to the FBI when he passed information along to the Southern District he knows who Bob Muller is and he's out spinning now from Supreme from from a fantastic choice in a man of integrity into a Nazi that's a narc so the question has to be what has happened to Newt Gingrich in the course of the past 11 months oh I has he decided that he is going to sacrifice his own integrity and reputation somebody he said was a good choice in the service of the president isn't Callisto in Rome I think so she was in line for the Vatican wasn't she I mean Newt was having an affair while his wife had cancer so he's a quality guy he has the right to stand up there and compare I'm more interested in the fact that he's a historian of sorts as he doesn't he write history books and documents he's a historian of sorts and that is again he knows better he knows he knows what the men and women of the FBI do every day he knows about Robert Muller's integrity in fact Willie he wrote about it just 11 months ago he knows that Comey or that robert muller has committed his life to service of this country when he could have been making millions and millions of dollars instead but he's chosen service first it's worth underlining one more time that clip you showed of newt gingrich was on the show that the president of united states and pushed his fifty million Twitter followers to go watch I knew what was gonna be on the show I'd say he produced it and he put have any push so Joe you've been around politicians and guys in power your life is to answer the question why does he do it is it simply to stay relevant so he exists is it is the self-esteem so low when the sense of self because it's clear what's happening about Newt is it just that I will do anything I will make any dance with the devil as long as somebody will listen to me I will say blue is black whatever what you've been around these people my entire life so you know it split up the people sellout for different reasons people humiliate themselves for different reasons I don't know why Gingrich is doing it maybe it's disdained as good stead maybe he thinks he's going to get an appointment some people will humiliate themselves to get an appointment other people will humiliate themselves in life or the president the United States because they want to make money either on Direct Mail perhaps or lobbying the president the United States I like for instance Paul Ryan will not come out people want Paul Ryan to tell the truth now Paul Ryan's not going to come out and tell the truth about Donald Trump because Paul Ryan wants to get a really big fat paycheck I mean I don't know specifically about this and Paul Ryan but let's just say if Paul Ryan started telling the truth about Donald Trump today his his power as a lobbyist would go down the drain so there are a lot of different reasons Joe digenova maybe he just likes being around power or maybe he makes a lot of money lobbying as a lawyer for clients that are associated with dummy Jonathan you know how Washington works so much of this can be traced back to just greed and money that's right it's to have that access to that big time job coming later that you don't want to burn bridges Donald Trump still is popular among Republicans he still has powerful friends out there there are people who would find that if Ryan suddenly spoke out now that'd be an act of betrayal it's a Republican party and therefore he wouldn't limit his ability to make a lot of money once it leaves Oh somebody so I wrote a book in 2004 attacking george w bush for spending too money for having a wilsonian foreign policy all of these other things republicans a lot of the same people laura ingraham i remember after the first debate i trashed george w bush's performance she attacked me hannity attack me they called me rhinos the last three years and Bush's presidency because I was attacking him for being a big spending big government Republican and having a wilsonian foreign policy the second George Bush leaves town his Buicks not even left city limits they're all attacking him he wasn't a real conservative we've got a fight back against people like george w bush because their scam artists it's all about money it's all about ratings it's all about speaking to the tribe yes you know they say oh I'm here at MSNBC so I must be a little bit no I say what I want to say I attacked Bhama I attacked George W Bush I attacked Romney during his campaign I'm attacking Trump now the thing is we have no tribe following us we have people from all tribes following us but for them the very people who are attacking me for telling the truth about george w bush ii bush left town guess what they started attacking bush and ii donald trump leaves town guess what all of these people are gonna do mark it down things that well you know we were there all along we were concerned about Donnelly there's what I said if you read between the lines when I was Speaker of the House you can see that I was quietly deep lurking there behind the scenes to try to stop that his abuse of constitutional norms that's what they will say been around it long enough I'm an old guy of 55 seen it before it's gonna happen the second Trump's out of town they were you remember the end of the Lion King you remember what happened to scar the hyenas chopped him and devoured him that's exactly what's gonna happen to Donald Trump and those hyenas are gonna all be these Republicans seconds that right now are comparing the FBI tonight exciting I will go to this gamma cuz this is cannot go for it I want to let you know that what you say today will be remembered by the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the men and women at the Justice Department and the men and the women in the CIA and the men and the women in the NSA and the men and the women who have committed their lives to upholding protecting and defending the Constitution of the United States you may think that you can just wash it to the side these attacks of our law enforcement officers and the people who are keeping us safe from Islamic radicalism that you talk about all the time but when Donald Trump leaves town your words will ring forever your attack of robert muller your attack of the Federal Bureau of Investigation's your it's act of the very people who are the front line of defense against terrorism against our families against our churches against our schools against our communities against our country good luck with that we'll be right back thanks for checking out MSNBC on YouTube and make sure you subscribe to stay up-to-date on the day's biggest stories and you can click on
