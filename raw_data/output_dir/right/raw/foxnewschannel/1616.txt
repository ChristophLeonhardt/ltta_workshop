ONLY GOING TO WASTE BUT THEY'RE

42
00:01:17,149 --> 00:01:18,617
BEING HORRIBLY MISMANAGED.

43
00:01:18,617 --> 00:01:22,421
THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WON'T LET

44
00:01:22,421 --> 00:01:25,091
US USE ANY PART OF OUR

45
00:01:25,091 --> 00:01:26,892

DIFFERENT WAYS.

00:02:06,866 --> 00:02:09,134
EVEN IF IT'S JUST CALLING 911,

72
00:02:09,134 --> 00:02:10,902
EVEN IF YOU CAN'T HELP IN DIRECT

73
00:02:10,902 --> 00:02:11,170
WAY.

74
00:02:11,170 --> 00:02:12,605
IF YOU SEE A CAR ACCIDENT,

75
00:02:12,605 --> 00:02:14,140
SOMETHING LIKE THAT.

76
00:02:14,140 --> 00:02:16,008

84
00:02:28,854 --> 00:02:30,790
MISMANAGED BY THE FEDERAL

86
00:02:32,725 --> 00:02:34,093
SICKENING AND I WANT TO TRY TO
