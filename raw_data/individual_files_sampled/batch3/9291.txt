OFFICIALS EXPRESS SEEING OPTIMISM THAT THE SUMMIT WILL PROVIDE A COMPLETE SOLUTION TO THE NORTH KOREAN NUCLEAR ISSUE. I'M JOINED BY THE "NEW YORK TIMES" BEST-SELLING AUTHOR OF "US VERSUS THEM." CONGRATULATIONS ON LANDING ON THE LIST. THANK YOU. Dana: YOUR BOOK CAME OUT AT A GOOD TIME. BEFORE I GET TO THAT PART OF IT LET ME ASK YOU ABOUT NORTH KOREA. IF THE HOSTAGES GET RELEASED THAT IS AN INCREDIBLE OUTCOME LEADING INTO THE SUMMIT. A BIG WIN. TRUMP DID OFFER SOMETHING. SUMMIT, BIG DEAL TO LEGITIMATE KIM JONG UN AND THE NORTH KOREANS WANT THAT. IN RETURN, NORTH KOREANS SUSPENDED NUCLEAR TESTS AND ICBM TESTS AND THEY DIDN'T HAVE TO DO. TRUMP HIMSELF SAID RED LINE, MISSILES HITTING THE LOWER 48. WELL, THIS IS DEFINITELY MOVING IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION BEFORE THE MEETING, BEFORE TRUMP. POLITICAL PRISONERS THIS IS A STICKING POINT, THIS IS RUN LIKE A CONCENTRATION CAMP IT SHOWS THAT THE NORTH KOREANS ARE TAKING THIS SERIOUSLY. Dana: WHAT MIGHT WE LEARN FROM THE HOSTAGES IF THEY ARE RELEASED FROM THE LABOR CAMP. WHAT MIGHT WE GLEAN FROM THAT? MASSIVE MISTREATMENT. THEY HAVE BEEN KEPT OUT OF COMMUNICATION. I'M SURE I WOULD BE SURPRISED IF THEY WERE TORTURED. BUT HAVING SAID THAT, I MEAN, YOU KNOW, THERE IS ENORMOUS AMOUNT OF INTERROGATION AND THE THINGS THERE IS NO HUMAN RIGHTS FOR THE PEOPLE WHEN THEY GO OVER. Dana: LAST WEEK YOU HAD A TWEET YOU PUT OUT THAT SAID TRUMP, MOON TOGETHER GETS VOTE FOR THE PEACE PRIZE. YOU SAID YOU HAVEN'T SEEN AS MUCH BACKLASH ON A TWEET AS FROM THAT. IF WE FIND PEACE IN NORTH KOREA IT SHOULD BE NOMINATION FOR THE PRIZE. THE BACKLASH TO ME WAS ABOUT TRUMP. THEY WEREN'T SAYING HOW COULD YOU SAY KIM JONG UN. Dana: THAT IS MY PART I CIRCLED. HE IS A LITTLE WORSE. EVEN IF YOU CAN'T STAND TRUMP AND A LOT OF PEOPLE CAN'T STAND TRUMP. EVEN SOMEONE LIKE ME THAT IS CRITICAL OF TRUMP'S FOREIGN POLICY. MORE OFTEN THAN NOT I THINK TRUMP GOT IT WRONG ON FOREIGN POLICY. BUT IF I SAY HE GETS ANYTHING RIGHT, NORTH KOREA IT'S NOT JUST BUMBLING INTO IT. THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION PUT MUCH MORE PRESSURE ON THE CHINESE TO SQUEEZE FOR SANCTIONS. THEY PUT MUCH MORE FRESH ON THE NORTH KOREANS TO REALIZE THEY NEED TO ENGAGE AND PRESSURE ON SOUTH KOREANS TO REALIZE THEY HAVE TO DO SOMETHING AND THAT IS MOVING THE NEEDLE IN A WAY THAT OBAMA AND BUSH WERE UNABLE TO. I SAY THAT AND PEOPLE ARE NOT PREPARED TO HANDLE IT. Dana: IF THE BOOK YOU TALK ABOUT "US VERSUS THEM" IS THAT PART OF IT? THAT THERE IS A FEELING, THAT EVEN IF HE DOES SOMETHING GREAT HE CAN'T GET CREDIT FOR IT? WE HAVE GONE TO THE POINT WHERE A BREAKING HALF TWEET THIS MORNING, A HALF TWEET WITH "... " NOT EVEN FINISHED YET IS BREAKING NEWS WE HAVE TO COVER. THAT HAPPENED TO ME ON THE NEWS THIS MORNING. IT'S NOT. TRUMP WILL BE GONE IN FOUR YEARS OR EIGHT YEARS' TIME AND THERE IS PRESUMPTION THAT IT WILL FIX THE PROBLEMS BUT ACTUALLY, THE REASON TRUMP WAS ELECTED PRESIDENT IS YOU WENT COMPLETELY OUTSIDE THE ESTABLISHED NORMS OF WHAT A DEMOCRAT OR REPUBLICAN PRESIDENT WOULD BE BECAUSE PEOPLE, AVERAGE PEOPLE IN UNITED STATES FEEL LIKE THIS COUNTRY AND THE ESTABLISHMENT NO LONGER SERVES THEM. THAT IS TRUE ECONOMICALLY, CULTURALLY, IT'S TRUE IN TERMS OF THE MILITARY AND IN TERMS OF TECHNOLOGY. THOSE ARE DEEP, DEEP-SEEDED THINGS THAT ARE JUST NOT GETTING FIXED. WE ARE NOT UNIQUE. THAT'S THE WAY THEY FEEL IN BRITAIN AND CANADA AND NEW ZEALAND. IT'S THE WAY THEY FEEL ACROSS THE CONTINENTAL E.U. IT'S ONLY IN JAPAN THEY DON'T FEEL THIS WAY BECAUSE NO IMMIGRANTS, POPULATION SHRINKING. NO MILITARY WITH FIGHTS ALL OVER THE WORLD. THEY ARE THE ONE COUNTRY THAT HAS REJECTED GLOBALISM SO NO ONE IS COMPLAINING. Dana: IN THE MINUTE I HAVE LEFT, LET ME ASK ABOUT ANOTHER AREA. WE HAVE PRESIDENT TRUMP'S DELEGATION ON HIS WAY TO CHINA. THEY ARE THERE TO DISCUSS THE TARIFF ISSUE TO WORK ON THE TRADE IMBALANCE. DO YOU THINK THAT IS A PLACE WHERE THE PRESIDENT IS WELL POSITIONED TO GET A GOOD DEAL FOR THE UNITED STATES? MUCH HARDER, RIGHT? FIRST, IT'S A BIG DELEGATION. THEY ARE NOT ALIGNED. THEY DON'T ALL AGREE THEY WANT THE SAME THING. THAT MAKES IT HARDER TO GET A DEAL DONE WITH THE CHINESE. I DON'T THINK WE WANT A TRADE WAR WITH CHINA. ON THE TECHNOLOGY PIECE WE ARE HITTING THEM HARD AND WE ARE HITTING THEM HARD ON AN ISSUE THAT THEY MADE THE DOMINANT STRATEGIC ISSUE FOR THE CHINESE PRESIDENCY. THEY WANT TO BE THE DOMINANT TECHNOLOGY POWER BY 2025. WE DON'T WANT THAT. Dana: NO. THIS IS GOING TO CREATE A FIGHT. I DON'T SEE US BACKING OFF THAT UP MANY. EVEN THOUGH THERE WILL BE A TRADE WAR IN TERMS OF THE TARIFFS GOING DOWN THE PIKE, THERE WILL BE A LITTLE BIT, WE ARE HEADING MORE CONFRONTATION WITH CHINA. Dana: SMART TO DO SOMETHING ON TECHNOLOGY? MORE SMART TO DO IT WITH THE ALLIES. THE FACT THAT EUROPEANS ARE NOT WITH US IS A PROBLEM FOR TRUMP'S FOREIGN POLICY. MAYBE THEY WILL LISTEN TO
