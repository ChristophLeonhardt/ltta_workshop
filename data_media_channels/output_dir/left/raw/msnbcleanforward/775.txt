1
00:00:01,603 --> 00:00:04,304
VERY CAREFUL BECAUSE THEY KNOW THE SUBURBAN WHITE WOMEN ARE

2
00:00:04,305 --> 00:00:05,538
THE SUBURBAN WHITE WOMEN ARE WATCHING AND THEY WEREN’T HAPPY

3
00:00:05,573 --> 00:00:07,707
WATCHING AND THEY WEREN’T HAPPY WITH THE WAY ANITA HILL WAS

4
00:00:07,742 --> 00:00:09,009
WITH THE WAY ANITA HILL WAS TREATED, AND THE ELECTION IS 50

5
00:00:09,010 --> 00:00:10,277
TREATED, AND THE ELECTION IS 50 DAYS AWAY.

6
00:00:10,278 --> 00:00:21,755
DAYS AWAY. >> SAM STEIN COLUMNS AND, COLLIN

7
00:00:21,790 --> 00:00:22,155
>> SAM STEIN COLUMNS AND, COLLIN MURKOWSKI.

8
00:00:22,156 --> 00:00:27,160
MURKOWSKI. THEIR STATES ARE TO THE WEST IN

9
00:00:27,161 --> 00:00:28,161
THEIR STATES ARE TO THE WEST IN THE UNITED STATES.

10
00:00:28,162 --> 00:00:29,596
THE UNITED STATES. IF THIS GUY GOES DOWN, WE’RE

11
00:00:29,630 --> 00:00:31,164
IF THIS GUY GOES DOWN, WE’RE GOING TO COME BACK WITH ANOTHER

12
00:00:31,198 --> 00:00:32,699
GOING TO COME BACK WITH ANOTHER NAME ON THE LIST MORE

13
00:00:32,734 --> 00:00:33,166
NAME ON THE LIST MORE CONSERVATIVE.

14
00:00:33,168 --> 00:00:34,568
CONSERVATIVE. THAT’S THE ONLY THING THAT

15
00:00:34,602 --> 00:00:36,269
THAT’S THE ONLY THING THAT ARGUMENT RUNS UP AGAINST IS

16
00:00:36,271 --> 00:00:38,037
ARGUMENT RUNS UP AGAINST IS PASSING THE COLLINS AND

17
00:00:38,072 --> 00:00:38,672
PASSING THE COLLINS AND MURKOWSKI TEST.

18
00:00:38,706 --> 00:00:40,541
MURKOWSKI TEST. >> RIGHT, AND YOU KNOW TO A

19
00:00:40,575 --> 00:00:41,875
>> RIGHT, AND YOU KNOW TO A CERTAIN DEGREE, McCONNELL DOES

20
00:00:41,910 --> 00:00:45,078
CERTAIN DEGREE, McCONNELL DOES NOT WANT TO HAVE TO START FROM

21
00:00:45,079 --> 00:00:45,445
NOT WANT TO HAVE TO START FROM SCRATCH.

22
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:46,580
SCRATCH. YOU KNOW, THE DISAPPOINTMENT

23
00:00:46,614 --> 00:00:50,083
YOU KNOW, THE DISAPPOINTMENT WITH THE BASE AT HAVING TO SCRAP

24
00:00:50,085 --> 00:00:51,318
WITH THE BASE AT HAVING TO SCRAP KAVANAUGH WILL BE PALPABLE.

25
00:00:51,352 --> 00:00:53,186
KAVANAUGH WILL BE PALPABLE. I THINK THEY ARE WORRIED ABOUT

26
00:00:53,221 --> 00:00:53,486
I THINK THEY ARE WORRIED ABOUT THAT.

27
00:00:53,488 --> 00:00:54,455
THAT. ON THE OTHER HAND, YOU GET THE

28
00:00:54,489 --> 00:00:56,890
ON THE OTHER HAND, YOU GET THE SENSE TALKING TO PEOPLE ON THE

29
00:00:56,925 --> 00:00:59,025
SENSE TALKING TO PEOPLE ON THE HILL THAT THEY ALSO ARE REALLY

30
00:00:59,060 --> 00:01:00,894
HILL THAT THEY ALSO ARE REALLY DEEPLY NERVOUS ABOUT THIS MONDAY

31
00:01:00,895 --> 00:01:01,461
DEEPLY NERVOUS ABOUT THIS MONDAY HEARING.

32
00:01:01,463 --> 00:01:02,896
HEARING. THERE’S REALLY VERY FEW THINGS

33
00:01:02,898 --> 00:01:03,997
THERE’S REALLY VERY FEW THINGS THAT CAN GO POSITIVE FOR THEM

34
00:01:04,031 --> 00:01:04,297
THAT CAN GO POSITIVE FOR THEM HERE.

35
00:01:04,299 --> 00:01:06,834
HERE. IT’S GOING TO BE A HE SAID-SHE

36
00:01:06,868 --> 00:01:08,802
IT’S GOING TO BE A HE SAID-SHE SAID, AND EVENTUALLY YOU HAVE TO

37
00:01:08,803 --> 00:01:12,706
SAID, AND EVENTUALLY YOU HAVE TO VOTE ON THAT.

38
00:01:12,707 --> 00:01:14,975
VOTE ON THAT. AND THEN WHAT TO DO ABOUT

39
00:01:14,976 --> 00:01:19,112
AND THEN WHAT TO DO ABOUT MURKOWSKI AND COLLINS.

40
00:01:19,114 --> 00:01:20,814
MURKOWSKI AND COLLINS. MY SENSE IS THEY BAKESICALLY ARE

41
00:01:20,849 --> 00:01:22,382
MY SENSE IS THEY BAKESICALLY ARE WAITING TO SEE WHERE THE CHIPS

42
00:01:22,417 --> 00:01:22,816
WAITING TO SEE WHERE THE CHIPS FALL.

43
00:01:22,817 --> 00:01:25,919
FALL. ONE OF THOSE CHIPS ARE WHAT DO

44
00:01:25,921 --> 00:01:28,322
ONE OF THOSE CHIPS ARE WHAT DO THE DEMOCRATS IN RED STATES DO?

45
00:01:28,323 --> 00:01:31,725
THE DEMOCRATS IN RED STATES DO? IT WAS WIDELY SEEN THAT THE

46
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:34,127
IT WAS WIDELY SEEN THAT THE MANSIONS IN THE WORLD, THE

47
00:01:34,129 --> 00:01:39,133
MANSIONS IN THE WORLD, THE HEITKAMPS IN THE WORLD, END UP

48
00:01:39,134 --> 00:01:40,334
HEITKAMPS IN THE WORLD, END UP VOTING FOR THEM.

49
00:01:40,335 --> 00:01:44,371
VOTING FOR THEM. IT’S GIVEN HEITKAMP AND MANSION

50
00:01:44,406 --> 00:01:49,944
IT’S GIVEN HEITKAMP AND MANSION AND DONNELLY TO SAY, WE CAN’T

51
00:01:49,978 --> 00:01:51,813
AND DONNELLY TO SAY, WE CAN’T TAKE OUR CHANCES WITH THIS GUY.

52
00:01:51,847 --> 00:01:53,247
TAKE OUR CHANCES WITH THIS GUY. >> I WOULD TAKE SAM’S SCENARIO

53
00:01:53,248 --> 00:01:55,316
>> I WOULD TAKE SAM’S SCENARIO AND SPIN IT OUT EVEN FURTHER.

54
00:01:55,317 --> 00:01:59,153
AND SPIN IT OUT EVEN FURTHER. I THINK SAM IS RIGHT, THE

55
00:01:59,154 --> 00:02:02,623
I THINK SAM IS RIGHT, THE DEMOCRATS HAVE A FREE PASS TO

56
00:02:02,624 --> 00:02:04,625
DEMOCRATS HAVE A FREE PASS TO VOTE AGAINST HIM.

57
00:02:04,626 --> 00:02:06,460
VOTE AGAINST HIM. AND THEN YOU ARE LOOKING AT A

58
00:02:06,461 --> 00:02:08,162
AND THEN YOU ARE LOOKING AT A VERY, VERY DICEY SITUATION.

59
00:02:08,163 --> 00:02:10,865
VERY, VERY DICEY SITUATION. LET’S SAY FOR SAKE OF ARGUMENT,

60
00:02:10,866 --> 00:02:11,966
LET’S SAY FOR SAKE OF ARGUMENT, KAVANAUGH’S NOMINATION DOESN’T

61
00:02:11,967 --> 00:02:13,034
KAVANAUGH’S NOMINATION DOESN’T GO FORWARD.

62
00:02:13,035 --> 00:02:14,836
GO FORWARD. IT DOESN’T SEEM CONCEIVABLE YOU

63
00:02:14,837 --> 00:02:17,672
IT DOESN’T SEEM CONCEIVABLE YOU GET ANOTHER NOMINEE BEFORE THE

64
00:02:17,673 --> 00:02:18,539
GET ANOTHER NOMINEE BEFORE THE ELECTION, VETTED TO THE

65
00:02:18,541 --> 00:02:20,841
ELECTION, VETTED TO THE COMMITTEE AND VOTED ON.

66
00:02:20,843 --> 00:02:22,376
COMMITTEE AND VOTED ON. THAT’S A LAME DUCK SAM WAS

67
00:02:22,411 --> 00:02:22,810
THAT’S A LAME DUCK SAM WAS TALKING ABOUT.

68
00:02:22,845 --> 00:02:24,679
TALKING ABOUT. LET’S SAY THE DEMOCRATS WIN THE

69
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:25,780
LET’S SAY THE DEMOCRATS WIN THE SENATE, WHICH IS WHAT MITCH

70
00:02:25,814 --> 00:02:27,081
SENATE, WHICH IS WHAT MITCH McCONNELL WAS TALKING ABOUT AS

71
00:02:27,082 --> 00:02:28,316
McCONNELL WAS TALKING ABOUT AS EARLY AS LAST WEEK.

72
00:02:28,350 --> 00:02:29,484
EARLY AS LAST WEEK. THEN YOU’RE IN A COMPLETELY

73
00:02:29,518 --> 00:02:30,452
THEN YOU’RE IN A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT SCENARIO.

74
00:02:30,486 --> 00:02:32,186
DIFFERENT SCENARIO. THE IDEA THE SENATE WOULD GO

75
00:02:32,221 --> 00:02:33,854
THE IDEA THE SENATE WOULD GO AHEAD WITH A LAME DUCK

76
00:02:33,889 --> 00:00:00,000
AHEAD WITH A LAME DUCK CONFIRMATION OF A JUSTICE TWO
