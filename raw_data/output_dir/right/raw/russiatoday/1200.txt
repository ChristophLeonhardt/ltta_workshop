00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,460
Hello! We are with a prestigious guest: Jean-Michel Aulas,

2
00:00:03,080 --> 00:00:04,800
president of the football club Olympique Lyonnais

3
00:00:04,840 --> 00:00:05,340
 

4
00:00:05,340 --> 00:00:08,980
and member of the executive board of the French Football Federation.

5
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:09,700
Hello Jan-Michel,

6
00:00:09,700 --> 00:00:15,480
thank you for giving us the honor to be with us on the Red Square in Moscow in our gorgeous RT studio.

7
00:00:16,100 --> 00:00:17,900
Why are you in Russia?

8
00:00:17,900 --> 00:00:18,400
 

9
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:19,980
As Olympique Lyonnais president?

10
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:25,020
As a member of the  of the French Football Federation?

11
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:28,920
As an entrepreneur or as a French team supporter? Explain it to us!

12
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:31,720
It's a bit of all of these.

13
00:00:32,220 --> 00:00:40,020
First of all, as president of the Olympique Lyonnais since it's a recruitment and transfer period.

14
00:00:40,220 --> 00:00:43,140
As a member of the executive committee, I follow the French team.

15
00:00:43,340 --> 00:00:47,500
Earlier, I was in Istra with Mr. Le Graet, the president of the FFF, to be as close as possible [to the players].

16
00:00:47,720 --> 00:00:49,180
Yesterday, I was obviously in Ekaterinburg.

17
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:59,740
And finally,  Cegit, my computing company that I found 30 years ago, which is now led by an American group, has an office here in Moscow

18
00:00:59,740 --> 00:01:02,140
so I take advantage [of being here].

19
00:01:02,500 --> 00:01:04,160
[Football] it's a true passion.

20
00:01:04,540 --> 00:01:12,760
It might be the sixth or seventh World Cup that I have followed entirely;

21
00:01:13,100 --> 00:01:16,940
so I'm really into our team, 'Les Bleus.'

22
00:01:16,940 --> 00:01:20,500
But I'm also crazy about this sport culture

23
00:01:21,820 --> 00:01:26,720
which is also a geopolitical one that gave us this World Cup here in Russia for the first time.

24
00:01:27,300 --> 00:01:32,420
What's your opinion regarding the organization of this World Cup and Russian hospitality?

25
00:01:32,420 --> 00:01:36,740
It's a successful World Cup in terms of organization.

26
00:01:37,260 --> 00:01:39,240
Security is at the highest level.

27
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:43,100
This imposes constraints, but it's better to have controlled constraints

28
00:01:43,260 --> 00:01:48,100
and a country which is available to every person who comes

29
00:01:48,220 --> 00:01:51,680
with gorgeous stadiums, with full stadiums!

30
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:58,500
The level [of football] is good, but the organization is on a higher level.

31
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:03,900
So I've got a lot of joy to be here in Moscow,

32
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:07,580
in Kazan a few days ago and in Ekaterinburg yesterday night.

33
00:02:07,580 --> 00:02:10,360
You were in Kazan and Ekaterinburg.

34
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:14,180
The next game for France will be in Moscow on Tuesday.

35
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:15,820
You follow 'Les Bleus'

36
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:20,560
How do you describe the beginning of the competition for the French team, which reached the first knock-out round?

37
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:22,980
It's a good beginning

38
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:28,160
It’s very difficult to make a good start when you are eyeing a final phase of the competition.

39
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:30,140
There is a physical preparation problem.

40
00:02:30,140 --> 00:02:32,960
We saw that this World Cup got a specificity:

41
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:37,120
it's a really physical competition, really tactical.

42
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:40,940
All of the teams, which are described as less strong than the strongest ones,

43
00:02:40,940 --> 00:02:48,380
have a very well organized strategy to be in the best shape as possible at first

44
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:55,120
and the French team managed to give positive signals by scoring essential goals to get six points.

45
00:02:55,360 --> 00:03:00,340
Yesterday, the French team also managed to resist the Peruvian team, which was amazing.

46
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:03,320
I was really, really impressed by the team from Peru,

47
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:05,460
which has a strong penetration force.

48
00:03:05,460 --> 00:03:13,500
Didier [Deschamps] managed to give his team the physical and tactical ability to respond

49
00:03:14,100 --> 00:03:19,280
which helped to resist a second goal during the first half.

50
00:03:22,100 --> 00:03:25,480
It is an excellent start to the competition.

51
00:03:27,020 --> 00:03:32,060
It helps us to prepare for the third match [with Denmark] in better shape.

52
00:03:32,060 --> 00:03:36,480
We know the French team will do better in the upcoming matches.

53
00:03:45,780 --> 00:03:49,960
Victory is essential at this stage of the competition.

54
00:03:51,620 --> 00:03:54,340
Bravo to the French team!

55
00:03:54,340 --> 00:03:58,180
I think they will perform great in the coming games of [the 2018 World Cup].

56
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:00,020
In your opinion, how far can they go?

57
00:04:00,580 --> 00:04:02,220
It's a bit too early.

58
00:04:02,540 --> 00:04:04,540
We see that all the big teams are struggling.

59
00:04:04,540 --> 00:04:06,620
I saw the first Germany game.

60
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,480
I also saw this afternoon Brazil win during the stoppage-time.

61
00:04:10,860 --> 00:04:21,820
I watched Argentina getting battered with Leo Messi, who is struggling.

62
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:23,320
How can we explain that?

63
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:27,760
As I said earlier, the teams that are ready to make it to the finale

64
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:32,320
prepare themselves to make it until the end and not exactly to be good in the group phase.

65
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:36,080
So we will see a stronger French team when the eliminating phase will start?

66
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:40,280
Yes and its opponent won't play to bother us but to score!

67
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:50,460
With our forward trio, we can even say our attacking quartet – don't forget our Nabil Fékir

68
00:04:50,460 --> 00:04:55,740
I think France will be more at ease in the next games.

69
00:04:55,740 --> 00:04:57,240
But what the team did so far was amazing.

70
00:04:57,240 --> 00:05:03,100
I was very impressed by the physical responsiveness of the French

71
00:05:03,100 --> 00:05:09,920
because, once again, the Peruvian team was very physically and tactically strong.

72
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:13,200
Which team do you want against France for the next round?

73
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:16,600
Argentina may still be possible. Or maybe Iceland?

74
00:05:16,980 --> 00:05:18,280
I think it would be Iceland.

75
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:24,820
And we already watched that game during Euro 2016.

76
00:05:24,820 --> 00:05:27,840
So I truly prefer Iceland.

77
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:37,080
Not because it is a 'small country,' they showed us great qualities of physical dynamism and solidarity,

78
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:41,900
but because I keep thinking that at any moment Argentina can wake up.

79
00:05:42,900 --> 00:05:49,980
And if Argentina wakes up at its fourth match, I don't want to be the team that faces it.

80
00:05:49,980 --> 00:05:55,180
You talked earlier about Nabil Fekir, who is on the French team and who plays on your team – Olympique Lyonnais.

81
00:05:56,200 --> 00:06:00,280
Jean-Pierre Bernès on LIC [French channel] said that his transfer to Liverpool could still happen.

82
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:09,420
Is it true? Can you confirm this? The Daily star wrote that Real Madrid may also be interested in him. Is that possible?

83
00:06:10,580 --> 00:06:13,720
Listen, it was once planned that he would go to Liverpool.

84
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:16,100
I gave him my agreement.

85
00:06:16,100 --> 00:06:18,480
That didn’t happen because it took too much time to succeed.

86
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:19,960
Nabil is an incredible player.

87
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:24,700
Regarding efficiency, he is great; we saw that again yesterday.

88
00:06:24,700 --> 00:06:27,720
He knows how to keep the ball and can create small unique spaces.

89
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:37,140
It’s true that the plan with Liverpool didn’t work out, and this has created interest in him from others clubs,

90
00:06:37,140 --> 00:06:40,420
and not only from Real Madrid and its new trainer.

91
00:06:40,420 --> 00:06:46,680
So, anything is possible. But we are, in Lyon, crazy about him…

92
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:50,920
Could he stay at Lyon?

93
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:53,500
My purpose is to make him stay.

94
00:06:54,900 --> 00:06:59,100
But as always, I listen to the players.

95
00:07:01,300 --> 00:07:04,140
To me, they are like my children, my sons.

96
00:07:04,140 --> 00:07:13,720
So, I hope he will stay, but if he wants to go, we will do our best to find him a bigger club to welcome his efficiency and his talent.

97
00:07:13,980 --> 00:07:16,340
Which player stands out to you during this competition?

98
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:26,600
I can’t say much about that, but the Croatian players yesterday gave us something to talk about.

99
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:41,900
I have really enjoyed the Mexican team – almost every player, regarding their motivation and their technical skills and desire to play forward.

100
00:07:42,740 --> 00:07:48,520
These two teams display enthusiasm and innovation

101
00:07:49,020 --> 00:07:57,420
I’m sure that Serbia will also bring a lot of new things to football.

102
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:03,600
I also liked the Russian team, which if you listened to some, should not be having success.

103
00:08:04,580 --> 00:08:14,280
They are one of my favorites because they have incredible strength, which is the strength that playing in your own country gives you, like for France in 1998.

104
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:15,640
They have very good players.

105
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:19,080
France-Russia – could that be the quarterfinal?

106
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:27,300
Emmanuel Macron said to Vladimir Putin during the St. Petersburg forum that he would be back in Russia if France goes to the quarterfinal.

107
00:08:27,980 --> 00:08:32,760
Is it possible? And could it bring France and Russia closer to each other?

108
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:40,780
Of course! It would be amazing because they are two big countries with two presidents who show fantastic qualities.

109
00:08:40,780 --> 00:08:50,060
When you watch Russia, which I know this past decade has evolved this way – strong on the cultural side,

110
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:57,120
on the organizational level, on the industrial and economic sides.

111
00:08:57,500 --> 00:09:01,920
And we have President Macron who wants to leaves his mark on the world.

112
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:04,300
It would be amazing to have France-Russia.

113
00:09:04,300 --> 00:09:10,100
But to me, Russia is crushing the hierarchical order of international football.

114
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:16,620
It’s great for our Russian friends, but we have to be careful – their team has a lot of quality.

115
00:09:16,620 --> 00:09:21,520
Thank you so much, Jean-Michel Aulas, for being our esteemed guest on RT France.

116
00:09:21,520 --> 00:00:00,000
It was a pleasure, especially in such a beautiful place.
