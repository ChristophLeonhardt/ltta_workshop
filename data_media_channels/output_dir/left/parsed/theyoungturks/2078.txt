YESTERDAY WE BROKE DOWN HOW
THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION IS
TAKING ALL THE WORK THAT THE
OBAMA ADMINISTRATION DID ON
RAISING FUEL EFFICIENCY
STANDARDS IN CARS, OF WHICH THEY
SET VERY AMBITIOUS TARGETS, AND
BY VERY AMBITIOUS I MEAN THEY
WOULD HELP CATCH US UP TO WHERE
THE REST OF THE WORLD IS, BUT IT
WAS BIG AND IT WAS LEADING TO
CAR COMPANIES MAKING MORE
EFFICIENT CARS.
THE TRUMP
ADMINISTRATION IS TEARING THAT
UP, YOU CAN SAY GOODBYE TO ALL
OF THAT, WE HAVE GONE BACK 15
YEARS OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT IN
TERMS OF FUEL EFFICIENCY.
TODAY
WE TURN TO THE CAR MANUFACTURERS
AND WHAT THEY ARE DOING BEHIND
THE SCENES TO HELP THE TRUMP
ADMINISTERED IN MAKING SURE THAT
OUR CARS ARE AS DIRTY AND
POLLUTING AND INEFFICIENT AS
POSSIBLE.
NOW THERE IS GOOD NEWS
COMING OUT OF CAR MANUFACTURERS,
THEY ARE DOING A LOT OF WORK ON
BOTH ELECTRIC CARS AND HYDROGEN
POWERED CARS, THEY ARE COMING
OUT WITH ONES THAT I THINK WILL
BE MORE APPEALING TO MORE
PEOPLE, ALL THAT IS GOOD NEWS.
BUT THAT IS THE FORWARD FACING
THING, THAT'S TO APPEAL TO
CONSUMERS, BEHIND THE SCENES
THEY ARE DOING SOME LOBBYING --
SO ON THE FRONT THEY SAY WE
EMIT LESS CARBON, WE ARE TOTALLY
EFFICIENT, IT'S AWESOME.
ON THE
BACK THEY ARE SAYING I DON'T
EVEN KNOW IF THAT SCIENCE IS ALL
THAT ACCURATE.
IS CARBON REALLY
CAUSING THE WORLD TO GET HOTTER?
ARE THESE EMISSIONS REALLY
LEADING TO SPIKES IN
CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE AND
THINGS LIKE THAT?
AND ONE OF THE
THINGS WE KNOW IT'S GOING TO BE
BIASED 
IS --
IF THAT BLOWS YOUR MIND AS A
VIEWER OF TYT IT'S PROBABLY
BECAUSE IT'S NOT REMOTELY TRUE,
BUT HE SAID IT --
THAT IS 100% COUNTERED BY ALL
THE SCIENCE WE HAVE --
AGAIN, SIMPLY UNTRUE.
AND
THEN HE INEVITABLY HAS TO DO
WHAT EVERY CLIMATE SCIENCE
DENIER DOES, IS IMPLY THAT
CARBON IS NATURALLY GOOD --
THAT'S AWESOME, SO WHY DON'T
WE PUT YOU IN A ROOM AND PUMP IT
WITH AS MUCH CO2 AS POSSIBLE
AND SEE HOW YOU FARE?
IT'S ACTUALLY GOOD FOR YOU, I
HEAR IT IMPROVES YOUR SKIN.
LIKE WHAT WE BREATHE OUT AND
WHAT THE TREES PROCESS, IT'S
THIS NICE NATURAL THING, SO YOU
CAN SUCK ON A TAILPIPE AND IT'S
COOL.
THAT'S WHO WROTE THIS
REPORT THAT THE NATIONAL HIGHWAY
TRAFFIC SAFETY ADMINISTRATION IS
GOING TO BE USING FOR SOME OF
THEIR ADVISORY ROLE WHEN IT
COMES TO CARS AND CLIMATE.
IT IS PROPAGANDA, THERE IS NO
TRUTH TO IT, BUT IT'S OUT THERE.
THIS DISINFORMATION MACHINE THEY
HAVE CREATED CONTINUES TO BE FED
BY ALL OF THESE SPECIAL INTEREST
GROUPS, IN THIS CASE IT'S THE
AUTOMOBILE LOBBY, BUT THEY
REALLY DON'T NEED IT TO WIN OVER
THIS ADMINISTRATION.
AS WE
HAVE SAID, THIS ADMINISTRATION
ONCE THESE ROLLBACKS, THEY DON'T
CARE ABOUT POLLUTION AND
EMISSIONS, THIS IS AS CANCER
RATES GO UP, AS SO MANY VICTIMS
OF THESE POLLUTANTS,
PARTICULARLY IN URBAN CENTERS,
CONTINUE TO BE REVEALED, WE GET
THIS KIND OF INFORMATION OUT
THERE.
AS I SAY IT'S NOT
FACT-BASED BUT IT'S PROPAGANDA
THAT WILL BE USED IN THE
ARGUMENT.
YOU WILL SEE MORE AND
MORE OF THIS, IT WILL BE
REPRINTED AND REGURGITATED BY
THIS ADMINISTRATION IN EVERY WAY
WHEN THIS ARGUMENT COMES UP.
AND LET'S BE CLEAR, EVERY TIME
YOU SEE A COMMERCIAL BY FORD,
GM, TOYOTA, WHERE THEY ARE
TOUTING THEIR FUEL-EFFICIENT
VEHICLES AND HOW THEY CARE ABOUT
THE ENVIRONMENT AND HOW THEY ARE
DOING WHAT THEY CAN TO CLEAN UP
THE POLLUTION, KEEP IN MIND THAT
BEHIND THE SCENES WHAT THEY ARE
REALLY DOING IS HIRING THIS
CLIMATE SCIENCE DENIER TO DO
THEIR BIDDING AND LOBBY ARE
ELECTED OFFICIALS TO CONTINUE
DEREGULATING WHATEVER
ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTIONS WE
HAVE.
THAT'S SHADY, SHADY.
I GUESS THE ONLY POSITIVE IS
THAT BECAUSE THEY OPERATE ON --
IN A CAPITALIST SYSTEM, WHILE
THEY WILL DO ALL THE STUFF THEY
DO AT THE END OF THE DAY HAVE TO
MAKE MONEY, AND THEY ARE
BETTING, AND THERE'S SOME
EVIDENCE IT WILL BE THE CASE,
THEY ARE BETTING THEY CAN TWIST
THE SYSTEM AND GET YOU TO BUY
HEAVILY POLLUTING SUVS THAT YOU
DON'T NEED AND ALL THAT STUFF,
THEY ARE DESPERATELY TRYING TO
GET BACK TO THE 90S AND EARLY
2000S WHERE THEY WERE DOING
THAT, SELLING PEOPLE CARS THEY
DON'T NEED BECAUSE THEY COST
MORE MONEY AND THE PROFIT
MARGINS ARE HIGHER.
A COUPLE OF
YEARS AGO I OWNED A CHEVY, IT
WAS AN ELECTRIC CAR, I LOVED IT,
AND CHEVY DIDN'T GIVE A DAMN
ABOUT THAT CAR, THE DEALERSHIPS
DIDN'T GIVE A DAMN ABOUT IT.
BUT
THANKFULLY IT SOLD WELL, SO THEY
COME OUT RECENTLY WITH THE CHEVY
VOLT AND I GUARANTEE CHEVY STILL
DOESN'T GIVE A DAMN ABOUT THAT
CAR, BUT IF PEOPLE BUY A LOT OF
THEM, AND AT LEAST IN LOS
ANGELES THEY ARE, THEY WILL MAKE
MORE, AND EVENTUALLY WE CAN DRAG
THEM INTO THE MODERN DAY AND
FORCE THEM TO MAKE CARS THAT ARE
GOOD BOTH FOR AMERICAN CONSUMERS
AND THE WORLD AT LARGE, AND
HOPEFULLY FORCE THEM TO STOP
DOING THIS SORT OF THING.
LAST POINT ON THAT, THE
ECONOMICS WILL HELP DICTATE
WHERE THIS GOES AND THAT'S WHAT
YOU ARE SAYING, AND I THINK THE
OTHER COMPONENT OF THAT IS FUEL
PRICES, THEY CONTINUE TO GO UP.
AS A CONSUMER NOTION FUEL
EFFICIENCY WILL BECOME
IMPORTANT, AND IF YOU DON'T HAVE
FUEL-EFFICIENT VEHICLES THEY
WILL GO TO ANOTHER COMPANY.
IN
THE MARKETPLACE MIGHT HELP THIS.
THEY ARE TRYING TO PROP UP OLD
ENERGY, DIRTY ENERGY LIKE COAL,
BUT IN THE END THE MARKETPLACE
WILL WIN OUT, AND IN THIS CASE I
THINK JOHN, WHO IS SUGGESTING
THOSE FUEL-EFFICIENT VEHICLES,
THEY PROBABLY WILL BE OF GREATER
APPEAL TO THE CONSUMER, THAT'S
RIGHT.
I HOPE SO, AND THANK YOU FOR
MENTIONING THOSE TARIFFS AGAIN
ON THE SOLAR STUFF, IT'S SO SAD
TO SEE THAT WE HAVE THIS
OPPORTUNITY TO BE A WORLD LEADER
ON THIS SORT OF TECHNOLOGY, TO
ACTUALLY RAMP IT UP A LOT, IT'S
BECOME FAR MORE PRICE
COMPETITIVE WITH DIRTY FORMS OF
ENERGY, AND TO SEE THE TRUMP
ADMINISTRATION TRY TO HANDICAP
THE DEPLOYMENT OF CLEAN ENERGY
IS DISHEARTENING.
