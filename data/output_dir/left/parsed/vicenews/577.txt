is it my cup of tea No
your rhythmic she was right I mean the
origin right songs are made to be
transformed play sand whistled hunt
again and again through generations a
great tune and a great melody it's
something you can really expand in any
direction the singer is very good a lack
of voice the arrangement is a bit and
fatty can a bit over-the-top for me
Beethoven can be over-the-top
please Beethoven
sometimes an anomaly distant um you
don't it's not a rule there's no rule in
infant composing that I think apply each
movie is different on each aesthetic
should be different some directors have
worked with would hate that the audience
would leave the room the theater
whistling a tune it does capture some
kind of a internal trauma an internal
anxiety and internal panic
yeah it sounds very public the Red Sea
is opening isn't it
no somebody at the door
it sounds a bit cheesy as at the choir
and quarter you know all these songs you
playing to me are great but for me I
wish we could play a string quartet
because if you see the kid here and
having the center string quartet he
might have tears in his eyes but he
doesn't know but he's never heard a
string quartet by Mozart or or Schubert
doesn't have the right to listen to that
you
