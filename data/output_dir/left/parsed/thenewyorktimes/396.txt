Every July, the elderflowers
come into bloom.
And I'm always watching and waiting for
that moment when they do finally pop.
This one tree in particular, which
sits at the base of the restaurant,
I can see it from where I'm cooking.
It's one long week where you can
enjoy the blossoms before they go by.
I love to harvest this for a
couple of reasons.
I love to make cordials that
are citrusy and sweet
and steep them overnight
to make syrups and sorbets.
And then I also really like to
make elderflower fritters, which
you can take the full stem of the flowers
and dredge them in some powdered sugar
and a little bit of club soda for
crispy elderflower fritters.
They're just really delicious
summery treats that
always just represent the
perfect time in July in Maine.
All of the ingredients
that are so important to us
come from the women who
work at the restaurant.
Each year we host a series of suppers.
We start at 6 p.m. and
do one seating, it's a prix-fixe
set multicourse menu
that is really driven by
the seasons and by the
ingredients of Maine.
