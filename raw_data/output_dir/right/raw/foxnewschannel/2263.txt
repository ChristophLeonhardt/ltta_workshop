1
00:00:11,287 --> 00:00:11,854
>> Martha: INTERESTING

2
00:00:11,854 --> 00:00:12,589
DEVELOPMENT ON PRESIDENT TRUMP'S

3
00:00:12,589 --> 00:00:14,023
MEETING ON NORTH KOREAN LEADER

4
00:00:14,023 --> 00:00:16,059
KIM JOHN GONE AND WHERE IT MIGHT

5
00:00:16,059 --> 00:00:17,160
TAKE PLACE.

6
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:19,262
>> WE ARE LOOKING AT VARIOUS

7
00:00:19,262 --> 00:00:20,163
COUNTRIES INCLUDING SINGAPORE

8
00:00:20,163 --> 00:00:21,631
AND WE ARE ALSO TALKING ABOUT

9
00:00:21,631 --> 00:00:25,335
THE POSSIBILITY OF THE DMZ.

10
00:00:25,335 --> 00:00:27,337
I THINK SOME PEOPLE MAY BE MIGHT

11
00:00:27,337 --> 00:00:28,938
NOT LOOK SO MUCH LIKE THE LOOK

12
00:00:28,938 --> 00:00:31,007
AT THAT AND I LIKE IT VERY MUCH.

13
00:00:31,007 --> 00:00:32,542
I THREW IT OUT AS AN IDEA.

14
00:00:32,542 --> 00:00:33,910
THERE IS SOMETHING I LIKE ABOUT

15
00:00:33,910 --> 00:00:34,978
IT BECAUSE YOU ARE THERE.

16
00:00:34,978 --> 00:00:36,546
YOU'RE ACTUALLY THERE.

17
00:00:36,546 --> 00:00:39,415
IF THINGS WORK OUT, THERE IS A

18
00:00:39,415 --> 00:00:41,351
GREAT CELEBRATION TO BE HAD ON

19
00:00:41,351 --> 00:00:44,120
THE SITE, NOT IN A THIRD-PARTY

20
00:00:44,120 --> 00:00:44,454
COUNTRY.

21
00:00:44,454 --> 00:00:46,322
>> Martha: INTERESTING, RIGHT?

22
00:00:46,322 --> 00:00:47,223
THIS IS NORTH KOREAN LEADERS

23
00:00:47,223 --> 00:00:47,991
KIM JONG UN BEGINNING TO SOFTEN

24
00:00:47,991 --> 00:00:49,826
HIS TONE, TELLING SOUTH KOREANS

25
00:00:49,826 --> 00:00:53,129
THAT, "I KNOW THE AMERICANS ARE

26
00:00:53,129 --> 00:00:53,997
INHERENTLY DISPOSE WITH US, BUT

27
00:00:53,997 --> 00:00:55,365
WHEN THEY TALK WITH US THEY WILL

28
00:00:55,365 --> 00:00:56,099
SEE I'M NOT THE KIND OF PERSON

29
00:00:56,099 --> 00:00:58,668
WHO WILL SHOOT YOU NUCLEAR

30
00:00:58,668 --> 00:01:01,938
WEAPONS TO THE SOUTH, OVER THE

31
00:01:01,938 --> 00:01:02,905
SPECIFIC, OR AT THE

32
00:01:02,905 --> 00:01:03,373
UNITED STATES."

33
00:01:03,373 --> 00:01:05,975
THE GUY WHO WAS ONCE DUBBED

34
00:01:05,975 --> 00:01:07,443
"LITTLE ROCKET MAN" BY TRUMP MAY

35
00:01:07,443 --> 00:01:10,313
ACTUALLY BE SPEAKING THE

36
00:01:10,313 --> 00:01:11,714
LANGUAGE OF A PEACEMAKER, AT

37
00:01:11,714 --> 00:01:12,382
LEAST AT THIS POINT.

38
00:01:12,382 --> 00:01:13,716
I SAT DOWN WITH SOUTH CAROLINA

39
00:01:13,716 --> 00:01:15,652
SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM, A MEMBER

40
00:01:15,652 --> 00:01:17,320
OF THE ARMED SERVICES AND

41
00:01:17,320 --> 00:01:17,887
JUDICIARY COMMITTEE.

42
00:01:17,887 --> 00:01:18,521
WATCH.

43
00:01:18,521 --> 00:01:19,922
FIRST OF ALL, ON THE LOCATION.

44
00:01:19,922 --> 00:01:21,057
DO YOU AGREE WITH

45
00:01:21,057 --> 00:01:23,126
PRESIDENT TRUMP, THE DMZ IS THE

46
00:01:23,126 --> 00:01:23,993
BEST PLACE TO DO THIS?

47
00:01:23,993 --> 00:01:27,764
>> THE WAR HAS NEVER ENDED.

48
00:01:27,764 --> 00:01:31,100
WE ARE IN A PLACE OF HIS

49
00:01:31,100 --> 00:01:31,534
HOSTILITIES.

50
00:01:31,534 --> 00:01:33,269
I LIKE THE IDEA OF WHERE THE

51
00:01:33,269 --> 00:01:33,970
ARMISTICE WAS SIGNED IS WHERE

52
00:01:33,970 --> 00:01:34,671
YOU END THE WAR.

53
00:01:34,671 --> 00:01:38,107
IF THIS DOESN'T WORK OUT, PEACE

54
00:01:38,107 --> 00:01:40,343
OR WAR IS NOT YOUR OPTION.

55
00:01:40,343 --> 00:01:41,411
THERE IS NO MIDDLE GROUND.

56
00:01:41,411 --> 00:01:42,178
>> Martha: IF THIS DOES NOT

57
00:01:42,178 --> 00:01:43,513
WORK OUT IS WHAT THE PRESIDENT

58
00:01:43,513 --> 00:01:43,946
TALKED ABOUT.

59
00:01:43,946 --> 00:01:45,048
HE SAID I WILL MEET WITH HIM.

60
00:01:45,048 --> 00:01:47,917
IF HE DOESN'T GIVE US WHAT WE

61
00:01:47,917 --> 00:01:49,919
WANT WHICH IS A REAL GUARANTEE,

62
00:01:49,919 --> 00:01:51,054
A VERIFIABLE GUARANTEE THAT THEY

63
00:01:51,054 --> 00:01:53,122
ARE DENUCLEARIZE.

64
00:01:53,122 --> 00:01:53,956
NOT THAT THEY WILL, RIGHT?

65
00:01:53,956 --> 00:01:57,527
THAT IS THE DEAL.

66
00:01:57,527 --> 00:01:59,128
>> KIM JONG UN IS PLAYING WITH

67
00:01:59,128 --> 00:01:59,429
FIRE.

68
00:01:59,429 --> 00:02:01,397
IF HE WANTS TO MEET WITH TRUMP

69
00:02:01,397 --> 00:02:02,098
AND HE DOESN'T DELIVER AND HE

70
00:02:02,098 --> 00:02:04,200
TRIES TO PLAY TRUMP LIKE HIS

71
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:04,834
FAMILY HAS PLAYED OTHER

72
00:02:04,834 --> 00:02:07,337
PRESIDENTS, THAT'S THE WORST

73
00:02:07,337 --> 00:02:08,137
THING HE CAN DO.

74
00:02:08,137 --> 00:02:08,871
THIS PRESIDENT IS SERIOUS ABOUT

75
00:02:08,871 --> 00:02:11,641
MAKING SURE THEY WILL NEVER HAVE

76
00:02:11,641 --> 00:02:13,710
A NUCLEAR WEAPON TO HIT THE

77
00:02:13,710 --> 00:02:14,344
HOMELAND.

78
00:02:14,344 --> 00:02:15,011
SIGNING A PEACE TREATY FOR

79
00:02:15,011 --> 00:02:17,013
GIVING UP NORTH KOREAN NUKES

80
00:02:17,013 --> 00:02:18,715
MAKES SENSE.

81
00:02:18,715 --> 00:02:21,417
TRUMP SHOULD GET THE NOBEL PEACE

82
00:02:21,417 --> 00:02:23,319
PRIZE IF THAT HAPPENS.

83
00:02:23,319 --> 00:02:23,886
BUT DON'T PLAY TRUMP.

84
00:02:23,886 --> 00:02:26,322
WE ARE GOING TO PLAY NICE WITH

85
00:02:26,322 --> 00:02:26,723
NORTH KOREA.

86
00:02:26,723 --> 00:02:28,324
>> Martha: CAN HE GET SOME

87
00:02:28,324 --> 00:02:28,958
KIND OF PROTECTION PROMISE

88
00:02:28,958 --> 00:02:29,592
BECAUSE HE LOOKS AT WHAT

89
00:02:29,592 --> 00:02:33,563
HAPPENED TO QADDAFI AND THAT'S A

90
00:02:33,563 --> 00:02:34,330
CONCERN FOR THE DEAR LEADER.

91
00:02:34,330 --> 00:02:36,532
>> THE DEAR LEADER HAS A CHOICE

92
00:02:36,532 --> 00:02:36,866
TO MAKE.

93
00:02:36,866 --> 00:02:38,701
BEFORE HE THOUGHT THE BEST PLACE

94
00:02:38,701 --> 00:02:39,602
TO SURVIVE IS TO HAVE A WEAPON

95
00:02:39,602 --> 00:02:44,707
THAT CAN HIT AMERICA, AND ALONG

96
00:02:44,707 --> 00:02:45,141
COMES TRUMP.

97
00:02:45,141 --> 00:02:46,042
TRUMP SAYS HE'LL NEVER LET HIM

98
00:02:46,042 --> 00:02:48,544
HAVE ACTIVE ABILITY.

99
00:02:48,544 --> 00:02:51,514
AN UNDERSTANDING HE WILL END THE

100
00:02:51,514 --> 00:02:53,216
WAR, BETWEEN SOUTH KOREA, U.S.,

101
00:02:53,216 --> 00:02:54,183
CHINA, UNITED STATES.

102
00:02:54,183 --> 00:02:56,185
WE ARE NOT GOING TO INVADE

103
00:02:56,185 --> 00:02:56,919
NORTH KOREA, BUT HAVING A TREE

104
00:02:56,919 --> 00:02:58,121
TO RECOMMENDING THEM AS A

105
00:02:58,121 --> 00:02:58,755
SEPARATE COUNTRY, TRY TO

106
00:02:58,755 --> 00:03:00,723
NORMALIZE RELATIONSHIPS, AND FOR

107
00:03:00,723 --> 00:03:02,325
THAT YOU HAVE TO GO TO YOUR

108
00:03:02,325 --> 00:03:02,625
NUKES.

109
00:03:02,625 --> 00:03:04,527
I THINK THAT'S A GOOD DEAL FOR

110
00:03:04,527 --> 00:03:04,927
EVERYBODY.

111
00:03:04,927 --> 00:03:06,262
>> Martha: I DO WANT TO PLAY

112
00:03:06,262 --> 00:03:07,964
SOMETHING ELSE FOR YOU.

113
00:03:07,964 --> 00:03:08,965
THIS IS BENJAMIN NETANYAHU, THE

114
00:03:08,965 --> 00:03:10,933
PRIME MINISTER OF ISRAEL TODAY.

115
00:03:10,933 --> 00:03:11,734
LET'S WATCH.

116
00:03:11,734 --> 00:03:14,737
>> THE WRONG DEAL, THE NUCLEAR

117
00:03:15,872 --> 00:03:18,908
>> THE IRAN DEAL WITH A NUCLEAR

118
00:03:18,908 --> 00:03:20,276
DEAL, IS BASED ON LIES.

119
00:03:20,276 --> 00:03:21,577
IT'S BASED ON A RAINY AND

120
00:03:21,577 --> 00:03:21,944
DECEPTION.

121
00:03:21,944 --> 00:03:24,013
IN A FEW DAYS' TIME,

122
00:03:24,013 --> 00:03:26,516
PRESIDENT TRUMP WILL DECIDE,

123
00:03:26,516 --> 00:03:29,519
WILL MAKE A DECISION ON WHAT TO

124
00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:30,720
DO WITH THE NUCLEAR DEAL.

125
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:32,722
I'M SURE HE WILL DO THE RIGHT

126
00:03:32,722 --> 00:03:33,089
THING.

127
00:03:33,089 --> 00:03:35,124
THE RIGHT THING FOR THE

128
00:03:35,124 --> 00:03:35,558
UNITED STATES.

129
00:03:35,558 --> 00:03:37,994
THE RIGHT THING FOR ISRAEL.

130
00:03:37,994 --> 00:03:40,296
AND THE RIGHT THING FOR THE

131
00:03:40,296 --> 00:03:42,198
PEACE OF THE WORLD.

132
00:03:42,198 --> 00:03:44,534
>> Martha: HE SAYS THERE IS NO

133
00:03:44,534 --> 00:03:45,968
EVIDENCE THAT THEY HAVE

134
00:03:45,968 --> 00:03:46,636
CONTINUED ELEMENTS OF THE

135
00:03:46,636 --> 00:03:46,969
PROGRAM.

136
00:03:46,969 --> 00:03:50,473
THIS IS FROM THE FOREIGN

137
00:03:50,473 --> 00:03:52,542
MINISTER IN IRAN.

138
00:03:52,542 --> 00:03:54,877
HE SAYS, "TRUMP IS JUMPING ON A

139
00:03:54,877 --> 00:03:55,511
REHASH OF OLD ALLEGATIONS

140
00:03:55,511 --> 00:03:58,815
ALREADY DOUBT WITH THE IAEA.

141
00:03:58,815 --> 00:04:02,985
OUR COORDINATED RENOVATIONS BY

142
00:04:02,985 --> 00:04:04,353
THE BOY WHO CRIES WOLF BEFORE

143
00:04:04,353 --> 00:04:07,423
MAY 12, BUT TRUMP'S AND PENSION

144
00:04:07,423 --> 00:04:08,090
WINDS TO CELEBRATE BLUE THE

145
00:04:08,090 --> 00:04:09,725
COVER."

146
00:04:09,725 --> 00:04:12,328
>> IN THE PAST, HAVE YOU TRIED

147
00:04:12,328 --> 00:04:13,196
TO BUILD A NUCLEAR WEAPON, THEY

148
00:04:13,196 --> 00:04:15,331
WILL SAY NO, THEY ARE LIARS.

149
00:04:15,331 --> 00:04:16,966
YOU DON'T BUILD OUR PLANS AT THE

150
00:04:16,966 --> 00:04:17,533
BOTTOM OF A MOUNTAIN.

151
00:04:17,533 --> 00:04:18,634
THEY HAD A NUCLEAR PROGRAM.

152
00:04:18,634 --> 00:04:21,536
THEY WERE TESTING WEAPONS, A

153
00:04:21,536 --> 00:04:23,105
DETONATION DEVICE, ON A MILITARY

154
00:04:23,105 --> 00:04:23,506
BASE.

155
00:04:23,506 --> 00:04:24,907
THEIR WHOLE PROGRAM WAS TO GET A

156
00:04:24,907 --> 00:04:25,508
NUCLEAR WEAPON.

157
00:04:25,508 --> 00:04:27,310
WHAT WOULD THEY DO WITH IT?

158
00:04:27,310 --> 00:04:28,377
THEY'VE BEEN LYING ABOUT THEIR

159
00:04:28,377 --> 00:04:29,045
AMBITIONS TOWARD A NUCLEAR

160
00:04:29,045 --> 00:04:29,378
WEAPON.

161
00:04:29,378 --> 00:04:30,046
BUT THEY ARE NOT LYING ABOUT

162
00:04:30,046 --> 00:04:31,981
WHAT THEY WOULD DO.

163
00:04:31,981 --> 00:04:35,051
THEY WRITE ON TO THEIR MISSILES,

164
00:04:35,051 --> 00:04:36,886
DEATH TO ISRAEL, DEATH TO

165
00:04:36,886 --> 00:04:37,220
AMERICA.

166
00:04:37,220 --> 00:04:39,088
YOU HAVE TO UNDERSTAND THAT THE

167
00:04:39,088 --> 00:04:41,891
AYATOLLAH IS A RELIGIOUS.

168
00:04:43,326 --> 00:04:44,694
THIS GUY IS A RELIGIOUS

169
00:04:44,694 --> 00:04:45,127
FANATIC.

170
00:04:45,127 --> 00:04:46,562
THE DAY WE VOTED ON THE NUCLEAR

171
00:04:46,562 --> 00:04:49,932
DEAL IN THE SENATE, HE TWEETED

172
00:04:49,932 --> 00:04:51,534
OUT, A LA WILLING, THE ZIONIST

173
00:04:51,534 --> 00:04:52,268
STATE WILL NOT EXIST 25 YEARS

174
00:04:52,268 --> 00:04:55,605
FROM NOW.

175
00:04:55,605 --> 00:04:58,274
SO WE

176
00:05:00,309 --> 00:05:02,745
-- IT'S TERRIBLE FOR ISRAEL, THE

177
00:05:02,745 --> 00:05:03,179
ARABS, AND US.

178
00:05:03,179 --> 00:05:04,580
I WOULD GET OUT IF I COULD NOT

179
00:05:04,580 --> 00:05:05,515
GET A BETTER DEAL.

180
00:05:05,515 --> 00:05:07,517
>> Martha: DO YOU THINK THERE

181
00:05:07,517 --> 00:05:10,119
IS ANY APPETITE IN WASHINGTON TO

182
00:05:10,119 --> 00:05:13,122
REDO THIS DEAL IN A BIPARTISAN

183
00:05:13,122 --> 00:05:13,523
WAY?

184
00:05:13,523 --> 00:05:14,323
>> YES.

185
00:05:14,323 --> 00:05:15,024
>> Martha: REALLY?

186
00:05:15,024 --> 00:05:16,125
>> TRUMP SAID THREE THINGS NEED

187
00:05:16,125 --> 00:05:17,593
TO CHANGE TO MAKE IT A GOOD

188
00:05:17,593 --> 00:05:17,894
DEAL.

189
00:05:17,894 --> 00:05:19,128
YOU CAN EXPECT ANYWHERE IN IRAN

190
00:05:19,128 --> 00:05:20,530
INCLUDING THEIR NUCLEAR BASES,

191
00:05:20,530 --> 00:05:24,100
SO THEY CANNOT ALLOW ACCESS TO A

192
00:05:24,100 --> 00:05:24,567
MILITARY BASES.

193
00:05:24,567 --> 00:05:25,735
THE MISSILE PROGRAM HAS TO BE

194
00:05:25,735 --> 00:05:26,702
PART OF THE DEAL.

195
00:05:26,702 --> 00:05:28,237
THE SUNSET CLAUSE, 50 YEARS FROM

196
00:05:28,237 --> 00:05:29,405
NOW ALL THE INSPECTORS LEAVE

197
00:05:29,405 --> 00:05:31,908
IRAN AND THEY CAN MARCH TOWARD A

198
00:05:31,908 --> 00:05:34,510
NUCLEAR WEAPON WITHOUT

199
00:05:34,510 --> 00:05:35,244
ACHIEVING, YOU HAVE TO CHANGE

200
00:05:35,244 --> 00:05:37,079
THOSE THREE THINGS FOR THE ONE

201
00:05:37,079 --> 00:05:39,582
THING THAT I MAY SAY TO MY

202
00:05:39,582 --> 00:05:40,116
DEMOCRAT COLLEAGUES.

203
00:05:40,116 --> 00:05:41,584
YOU MAY HAVE DONE THIS IN GOOD

204
00:05:41,584 --> 00:05:42,351
FAKERY YOU THOUGHT THEY WOULD BE

205
00:05:42,351 --> 00:05:44,921
A BETTER NATION.

206
00:05:44,921 --> 00:05:46,255
THEY HAVE CAPTURED OUR SAILORS

207
00:05:46,255 --> 00:05:46,956
ON THE HIGH SEA AND EMULATED

208
00:05:46,956 --> 00:05:47,657
THEM SINCE THE DEAL.

209
00:05:47,657 --> 00:05:51,761
THEY TESTFIRED WEAPONS IN

210
00:05:51,761 --> 00:05:53,796
VIOLATION OF THE U.N. REVOLUTION

211
00:05:53,796 --> 00:05:54,664
VIOLATION OF THE U.N. REVOLUTIO

212
00:05:54,664 --> 00:05:55,064
REVOLUTION.

213
00:05:55,064 --> 00:05:56,065
THEY HAVE DISMEMBERED SYRIA.

214
00:05:56,065 --> 00:05:59,302
THEY HAVE TAKEN OVER YEMEN.

215
00:05:59,302 --> 00:06:00,603
THEY CONSTANTLY THREATEN ISRAEL,

216
00:06:00,603 --> 00:06:01,904
THREATEN ISRAEL.

217
00:06:01,904 --> 00:06:02,538
THEY HAVE GIVEN HAS BELOW

218
00:06:02,538 --> 00:06:03,539
160,000 ROCKETS.

219
00:06:03,539 --> 00:06:06,075
EVERYTHING THEY'VE DONE SINCE

220
00:06:06,075 --> 00:06:07,610
THE DEAL SHOWS THEY DO NOT WANT

221
00:06:07,610 --> 00:06:10,413
PEACE, THEY REALLY HAVE A WAR

222
00:06:10,413 --> 00:06:12,114
AGENDA.

223
00:06:12,114 --> 00:06:14,317
>> YOU THINK THERE WILL BE

224
00:06:14,317 --> 00:06:16,319
DEMOCRATS COMING TO THE TABLE IN

225
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:16,619
THAT?

226
00:06:16,619 --> 00:06:20,323

227
00:06:20,323 --> 00:06:22,425

228
00:06:22,425 --> 00:06:23,059
GET BEHIND THE PRESIDENT'S

00:06:23,059 --> 00:06:24,527
DESIRE TO GET BEHIND, I WILL

230
00:06:24,527 --> 00:06:26,128
WORK WITH YOU TO ASK THE

MAY THE 12TH, IF I CAN GET

234
00:06:30,299 --> 00:06:31,667
DEMOCRATS TO SUPPORT THE IDEA OF

00:06:31,667 --> 00:06:34,403
THE DEAL NEEDS TO BE CHANGE, I

236
00:06:34,403 --> 00:06:35,137
