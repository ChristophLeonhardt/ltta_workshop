IS IT JUST A HE SAID-SHE SAID? IS IT REALLY THAT SIMPLE? AND WHY IS THIS NOW IN THE HANDS OF THE FBI? WHY? BECAUSE THE ESTABLISHMENT REPUBLICANS ARE BUCKLED, CAUSED AND BOWED TO THE DEMOCRATS OR SHOULD I SAY DEMON RATS. THE SPECTACLE I SAW THIS WEEK WAS ONE OF THE MOST OF PATHETIC, DISHEARTENING, SADDEST DISPLAYS TO WHICH THIS NATION HAS EVER STOOD WITNESS. IT WAS FOR ALL INTENTS AND PURPOSES A CRUCIFIXION OF A MAN WHO LED THE KIND OF EXEMPLARY LIFE KNEW OF US CAN MIRROR. I WAS A FELONY COURT JUDGE. I WAS A PROSECUTOR AND D.A. SEX CRIMES AGAINST WOMEN AND CHILDREN WERE MY CRUSADE. I ASSESSED WHETHER CASES SHOULD GO FORWARD, IF THE ACCUSED SHOULD BE CONVICTED AND AS A JUDGE WHAT THE SENTENCE SHOULD BE. NO ONE SYMPATHIZES MORE THAN I WHEN IT COMES TO WOMEN WHO ARE THE SILENT VICTIMS OF CRIMES. I CREATED THE FIRST DOMESTIC CHRIS TEEN * NARIS TEEN * NATIS TEEN * NATIONTEEN * VIOLENCE SECTION IN THE NATION. NATION.EEN * CHRISTINE BLASEY FORD IS A LOVEY LADY AND I BELIEVE SOMETHING HAPPENED TO HER. BUT SHE IS IN OVER HER HEAD AND SHE IS BEING USED. NO MATTER HOW MANY HIPPOCAMPUS BRAIN COMPARISONS SHE MADE. SHE COULDN'T REMEMBER THE FUNDAMENTALS, WHOSE HOUSE IT WAS, WHERE IT WAS, HOW SHE GOT TO THE HOUSE OR HOW SHE GOT HOME. SHE WENT 36 YEARS WITHOUT TELLING ANYONE BEFORE NOW. IF FORD SAID NO ONE WAS THERE, THAT IT WAS JUST SHE AND KAVANAUGH AND JUST HE AND SHE ALONE IN THE PARKING LOT, THEN IT'S A TRUE HE SAID-SHE SAID. BUT ONCE SHE CHOSE TO SAY THERE WERE FOUR PEOPLE THERE IT'S A THEY SAID. YET ALL FOUR OF THEY SAID SOMETHING HAPPENED. THEY WEREN'T THERE. THEY DON'T KNOW WHAT SHE IS TALKING ABOUT. WHAT DOES THAT TELL YOU ABOUT FORD'S MEMORY? IF THEY WEREN'T THERE, IS IT POSSIBLE KAVANAUGH WASN'T THERE EITHER? CRUCIAL HERE IS FORD'S THERAPY VISIT IN 2012. FOR THE FIRST TIME IN THREE DECADE SHE SAYS SHE MENTIONED KAVANAUGH'S NAME. IF TRUE, WHY WAS THE NAME KAVANAUGH NOT IN THE THERAPIST NOTES. AND WHY WOULD FORD'S LAWYERS WITH HOLD THOSE THERAPIST NOTES, AT LEAST THE PART THAT REFERRED TO THIS ALLEGED EVENT. WHY WAS FORD SO EVASIVE WHEN QUESTIONED BY THE PROSECUTOR ON THIS ISSUE. WHY DID HER ATTORNEY INTERFERE WITH HER ANSWERING IN HER TESTIMONY ON THIS POINT. THE MESSAGE USED TO HELP HER RECALL WHATEVER TRAUMATIC EVENT OCCURRED. IF A RAPE VICTIM UNDERGOES HYPNOSIS THE COURT AND JURY IS ENTITLED TO KNOW. BECAUSE OF THE RISK LIKE TELEVISION, NEWSPAPERS, THAT IMPACT ONE'S MEMORY, IT IS NOT A RELIABLE MEANS REFRESHING ONE'S RECOLLECTION. HER ATTORNEYS SAID SHE WAS AFRAID TO FLY AND HAD TO DRIVE ACROSS THE COUNTRY. BUT SHE WAS NEVER TOLD THE COMMITTEE WAS WILLING TO COME TO HER. SHE IS NOT AFRAID TO FLY. SHE HAS FLOWN ALL OVER THE COUNTRY, THE WORLD, THE SOUTH PACIFIC AND HAWAII. MOVE ALL OF THAT OUT OF THE WAY. WHAT WE ARE DEALING WITH HERE IS HYPOCRISY. NOT WHAT'S RIGHT AND WRONG, WHO'S GUILTY AND INNOCENT. THIS IS ABOUT PEOPLE DESPERATE TO WIN AT ALL COSTS. TAKE A MAN AND HIS FAMILY DOWN, NO PROBLEM. IT'S THE BATTLE OF THE HYPOCRITES. JEFF FLAKE IS THE PERFECT EXAMPLE. HE SAYS AFTER THE HEARING HE'S GOING TO VOTE FOR KAVANAUGH. BUT THE MAN BUCKLES AFTER TWO WOMEN SCREAM AT HIM WHILE PREVENTING HIS ELEVATOR DOOR FROM CLOSING. LOOK AT ME WHEN I'M TALKING TO YOU. YOU ARE TELLING ME MY VOTE DOESN'T MATTER. WHAT HAPPENED TO ME DOESN'T MATTER. JUDGE JEANINE: OF COURSE IT MATTERS. BUT WHAT DOES YOUR ABUSE HAVE TO DO WITH BRETT KAVANAUGH? HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF WOMEN HAVE BEEN ABUSED IN THIS COUNTRY. TAKE YOUR ANGER OUT ON THE PERSON WHO ABUSED YOU. GO TO COURT, CONVICT HIM, SEND HIM TO JAIL, SPIT ON HIM, I DON'T CARE. BUT DON'T YOU DARE BLAME BRETT KAVANAUGH FOR YOUR VICTIMIZATION. ONLY WHEN JEFF FLAKE IS DUMB ENOUGH, WEAK ENOUGH TO NOT EVEN GET. SPARTACUS HAS THE GAL TO SPARTACUS HAS THE -AL TO SPARTACUS HAS THE L TO SPARTACUS HAS THE TTO CORY BOOKER THE WANNABE SPARTACUS HAS THE THE GALL TO STAND UP AND CRITICIZE. BERKE ADMITS GROPING ANOTHER YOUNG WOMAN WHEN HE WAS 15. WHY AREN'T WE GOING AFTER HIM. AND GNATS GENIUS THAT GENIUS SENATOR MAIZIE HIRONO WHO ALLEGEDLY GRADUATED FROM HIGH SCHOOL. SKIPPED THE PRESUMPTION OF INNOCENCE CLASS. WHEN YOU HAVE THE NERVE TO SAY THE REPUBLICANS TOSSED OUT THE RULES. YOU ARE THE ONE WHO DECLARED KAVANAUGH GUILTY BEFORE YOU HEARD ANY DEFENDANT MONEY BECAUSE SHE WAS THE ACCUSER AND ALL MEN SHOULD SHUT UP. AND YOU ARE SAYING ALL CONSERVATIVES ARE NOT ENTITLED TO THE PRESUMPTION OF INNOCENCE? WHO ARE YOU? BUT MY FAVORITE, DIANNE FEINSTEIN. MADAME, YOU DON'T DESERVE TO BE IN THE UNITED STATES SENATE. AND NO ONE CAN BELIEVE ANYTHING YOU HAVE TO SAY. EACH OF THESE ALLEGATIONS SHOULD BE INVESTIGATED BY THE FBI. JUDGE JEANINE: TWO DAYS AGO YOU CALLED FOR AN FBI INVESTIGATION. WHAT A SHOCK. WHY DIDN'T YOU ASK FOR IT IN JULY WHEN YOU GOT THE FORD LETTER? YOU DIDN'T ASK FOR IT BECAUSE NO, LIKE A CHESS SHIRE NO, LIKE A CHESSSHHIRE NO, LIKE A CHESSSHIRRE NO, LIKE A CHESSSHIREE AROUND HYPOCRITE. NO, LIKE A CHESSSHIRE CAT YOU SAT ON IT. CHRISTINE FORD DIDN'T WANT TO BE EXPOSED. BUT, NO, YOU HAD OTHER PLANS. YOUR PLAN WAS TO LIKE THE. YOU ACTUALLY GAVE FORD THE NAME OF THE DREM KRAT ATTORNEY. BOOR DR. FORD, THERE IS WOMAN DOESN'T KNOW SHE WAS NOTHING MORE THAN A PUPPET ON THE STRING OF DEMOCRATIC POLITICS. DIANNE, WHERE IS YOUR INTEGRITY. YOU AND EVERYONE IN THE SENATE KNOW HOW THIS SHOULD HAVE BEEN HAND. CONFIDENTIALLY. THE FBI SHOULD HAVE BEEN INVOLVED. NO ONE HAS RESPECT FOR YOU. IN THE END LINDSEY GRAHAM SAID IT BEST. THERE IS NO WAY TO INVESTIGATE SOMETHING THAT HAPPENED 35 YEARS AGO WHEN YOU CAN'T TELL THE MONTH, THE LOCATION. THIS IS NOT ABOUT GET TOGETHER TRUTH. JUDGE JEANINE: THAT'S THE OPENING STATEMENT. IF YOU LIKE MY OPENING
