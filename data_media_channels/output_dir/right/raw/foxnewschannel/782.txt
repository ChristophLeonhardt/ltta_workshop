1
00:00:00,549 --> 00:00:01,784
LAURA INGRAHAM TAKES IT AWAY.

2
00:00:01,784 --> 00:00:03,786
>> Laura: SEAN, THANK YOU SO

3
00:00:03,786 --> 00:00:04,186
MUCH.

4
00:00:04,186 --> 00:00:05,321
FANTASTIC TRIBUTE.

5
00:00:05,321 --> 00:00:06,389
I'M LAURA INGRAHAM.

6
00:00:06,389 --> 00:00:07,556
THIS IS "THE INGRAHAM ANGLE."

7
00:00:07,556 --> 00:00:09,125
AS SEAN JUST MENTIONED, OUR

8
00:00:09,125 --> 00:00:11,560
HEARTS ARE HEAVY HERE AT FOX AND

9
00:00:11,560 --> 00:00:13,763
OF COURSE, THE SAD NEWS,

10
00:00:13,763 --> 00:00:14,463
CHARLES KRAUTHAMMER, BELOVED

11
00:00:14,463 --> 00:00:17,566
COLUMNIST, FATHER, HUSBAND, OF

12
00:00:17,566 --> 00:00:19,201
COURSE, CONTRIBUTED A FOX NEWS,

00:00:19,201 --> 00:00:20,936
PULITZER PRIZE WINNER, POLITICAL

14
00:00:20,936 --> 00:00:22,905
COMMENTATOR DIED TODAY AT AGE

15
00:00:22,905 --> 00:00:23,172
68.

16
00:00:23,172 --> 00:00:24,907
HIS DEATH WAS A SHOCK BUT WAS

17
00:00:24,907 --> 00:00:25,574
NOT UNEXPECTED.

18
00:00:25,574 --> 00:00:27,710
HE TOLD US TWO WEEKS AGO THAT HE

19
00:00:27,710 --> 00:00:28,477
HAD TERMINAL CANCER AND NOT TOO

20
00:00:28,477 --> 00:00:32,081
LONG TO LIVE.

21
00:00:32,081 --> 00:00:33,549
CHARLES BECAME A

22
00:00:33,549 --> 00:00:34,283
LARGER-THAN-LIFE FIGURE DURING

23
00:00:34,283 --> 00:00:35,351
HIS DECADE AT FOX NEWS.

24
00:00:35,351 --> 00:00:38,187
HE WAS ONE OF THE MOST RESPECTED

25
00:00:38,187 --> 00:00:39,955
POLITICAL ANALYSTS IN

26
00:00:39,955 --> 00:00:40,956
WASHINGTON, I THINK IN THE

27
00:00:40,956 --> 00:00:42,758
UNITED STATES, NO DOUBT ABOUT

28
00:00:42,758 --> 00:00:43,559
IT, AND A BELOVED PRESENCE IN

29
00:00:43,559 --> 00:00:46,328
THE NEWSROOM HERE.

30
00:00:46,328 --> 00:00:47,530
CHARLES WAS ULTIMATELY LOST FOR

31
00:00:47,530 --> 00:00:50,332
WORDS BUT HE OFTEN PUT OTHERS IN

32
00:00:50,332 --> 00:00:51,400
THAT POSITION, AS I KNOW

33
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:52,134
PERSONALLY.

34
00:00:52,134 --> 00:00:54,570
IT WAS HIS HUMOR, I THINK, THAT

35
00:00:54,570 --> 00:00:56,138
A LOT OF US, AS WE SMILED

36
00:00:56,138 --> 00:00:57,606
TONIGHT REMEMBERING HIM, OR

37
00:00:57,606 --> 00:01:00,009
THINKING ABOUT TONIGHT.

38
00:01:00,009 --> 00:01:01,911
>> ALL KINDS OF FOLKS, FOR THE

39
00:01:01,911 --> 00:01:03,212
LAST YEAR, AND THE END,

40
00:01:03,212 --> 00:01:04,813
HILLARY'S NOT GOING TO RUN.

41
00:01:04,813 --> 00:01:07,850
I SAID 100%, SHE WOULD RUN,

42
00:01:07,850 --> 00:01:08,751
UNLESS SHE IS STRUCK BY

43
00:01:08,751 --> 00:01:09,618
LIGHTNING.

44
00:01:09,618 --> 00:01:10,820
THERE IS NO LIGHTNING.

45
00:01:10,820 --> 00:01:13,422
I THINK THERE IS SOME PEOPLE WHO

46
00:01:13,422 --> 00:01:14,890
GET IN, AND THEY ARE NOT GOING

47
00:01:14,890 --> 00:01:16,826
TO GET OUT UNLESS THEY ARE

48
00:01:16,826 --> 00:01:18,694
BEATEN.

49
00:01:18,694 --> 00:01:20,696
SPEAKING AS AN AMATEUR

50
00:01:20,696 --> 00:01:23,733
PSYCHIATRIST.

51
00:01:23,733 --> 00:01:26,902
SO WHAT IF YOU LOOK LIKE A LUCKY

52
00:01:26,902 --> 00:01:27,269
LUCIANO?

53
00:01:27,269 --> 00:01:30,673
IT DOESN'T MATTER TO US AT ALL.

54
00:01:30,673 --> 00:01:36,545
>> THAT IS DRAWN FOR ME.

55
00:01:36,545 --> 00:01:37,813
[LAUGHTER]

56
00:01:37,813 --> 00:01:40,049
>> I THINK HE WAS CALLING ME.

57
00:01:40,049 --> 00:01:41,550
[LAUGHTER]

58
00:01:41,550 --> 00:01:42,251
>> HE WAS DEFINITELY CALLING

59
00:01:42,251 --> 00:01:43,986
YOU.

60
00:01:43,986 --> 00:01:46,155
>> WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE

61
00:01:46,155 --> 00:01:47,623
BETWEEN A DEMOCRAT AND A

62
00:01:47,623 --> 00:01:47,990
SOCIALIST?

63
00:01:47,990 --> 00:01:52,528
>> A DEMOCRAT IS A SOCIALIST --

64
00:01:52,528 --> 00:01:54,430
>> ARE WE GOING TO FIGHT LIKE

65
00:01:54,430 --> 00:01:55,798
THEY DID?

66
00:01:55,798 --> 00:01:57,366
>> NO, NO.

67
00:01:57,366 --> 00:01:58,467
>> I SAID HERE A WEEK AGO THAT

68
00:01:58,467 --> 00:02:05,174
IT WILL SNOW AND     IN HELL BEF

69
00:02:05,174 --> 00:02:05,207
IT WILL SNOW AND     IN HELL BER

00:02:05,207 --> 00:02:05,241
IT WILL SNOW AND     IN HELL BE

IT WILL SNOW AND     IN HELL BEH

IT WILL SNOW AND     IN HELL BEE

73

OBAMA DOJ INDICTS HILLARY.

74
00:02:11,547 --> 00:02:12,648
I'M WILLING TO ENTERTAIN A

75
00:02:12,648 --> 00:02:14,083
BELIEF IN CLIMATE CHANGE BEFORE

76
00:02:14,083 --> 00:02:14,383
THAT.

77
00:02:14,383 --> 00:02:15,484

BOY, ALL OF US HAVE SO MANY

92
00:02:40,209 --> 00:02:42,945
MEMORIES OF CHARLES.

93
00:02:42,945 --> 00:02:46,549
BEFORE WE GO TO THE PANEL HERE,

94
00:02:46,549 --> 00:02:47,449
BRET, YOU SAT IN THE SEAT SO

95
00:02:47,449 --> 00:02:50,753
MANY NIGHTS, AS DID BRIT HUME,

96
00:02:50,753 --> 00:02:51,821
WITH CHARLES TO YOUR RIGHT, AND

97
00:02:51,821 --> 00:02:56,258
IT WAS ALWAYS A ROLLICKING RIDE.

98
00:02:56,258 --> 00:02:57,693
AND COMMERCIAL BREAKS, WHERE ALL

99
00:02:57,693 --> 00:03:00,329
THE FUN USUALLY HAPPENS, AND IN

100
00:03:00,329 --> 00:03:02,531
THE ONLINE SPECIAL SHOW, WHERE

101
00:03:02,531 --> 00:03:03,766
CHARLES WAS EVEN FUNNIER THAT HE

102
00:03:03,766 --> 00:03:05,100
WAS ON THE PANEL.

103
00:03:05,100 --> 00:03:07,803
SOME REFLECTIONS TONIGHT?

104
00:03:07,803 --> 00:03:10,139
>> YEAH, YOU KNOW, IT IS A

105
00:03:10,139 --> 00:03:11,173
BITTERSWEET MOMENT BECAUSE I

106
00:03:11,173 --> 00:03:13,943
LIKE LOOKING BACK AT THOSE

107
00:03:13,943 --> 00:03:15,344
MOMENTS, AND THE FUN AND HUMOR.

108
00:03:15,344 --> 00:03:17,313
I JUST TALKED TO DANIEL, WHO WAS

109
00:03:17,313 --> 00:03:20,683
AT HIS DAD'S SIDE, ALONG WITH

110
00:03:20,683 --> 00:03:24,787
HIS WIFE, ROBYN, AND THEY'VE

111
00:03:24,787 --> 00:03:26,655
BEEN HEARTENED BY SOME OF THESE

112
00:03:26,655 --> 00:03:28,958
MEMORIES AND SOME OF THE

113
00:03:28,958 --> 00:03:29,658
STORIES, AND LOOKING AT THEIR

114
00:03:29,658 --> 00:03:33,729
DAD AND HIS PRIME, CHARLES COULD

115
00:03:33,729 --> 00:03:34,730
LIGHT UP A ROOM.

116
00:03:34,730 --> 00:03:37,333
HE COULD CRACK A JOKE.

117
00:03:37,333 --> 00:03:38,467
HE WAS MY FIRST BASEMAN THEY ARE

118
00:03:38,467 --> 00:03:40,169
ON THE PANEL FOR ALMOST TEN

119
00:03:40,169 --> 00:03:41,136
YEARS.

120
00:03:41,136 --> 00:03:43,439
BEFORE THAT, ALONGSIDE BRIT HUME

121
00:03:43,439 --> 00:03:44,306
BEFORE THAT, ALONGSIDE BRIT HUM

122
00:03:44,306 --> 00:03:44,673
BRIT HUME.

123
00:03:44,673 --> 00:03:46,775
HE COULD CUT THROUGH THE NOISE

124
00:03:46,775 --> 00:03:49,411
OF THE DAY, AND THEN CRACK US UP

125
00:03:49,411 --> 00:03:51,046
IN THE COMMERCIAL BREAKS LIKE

126
00:03:51,046 --> 00:03:51,580
NOBODY ELSE COULD.

127
00:03:51,580 --> 00:03:53,983
SO HE JUST HAD A GIFT.

128
00:03:53,983 --> 00:03:56,552
HIS WRITING WAS ON LIKE -- I

129
00:03:56,552 --> 00:03:58,487
DON'T THINK YOU ARE GOING TO SEE

130
00:03:58,487 --> 00:04:00,522
ANOTHER COLUMNIST THAT HAD HIS

131
00:04:00,522 --> 00:04:02,558
PENETRATING KIND OF WISDOM AND

132
00:04:02,558 --> 00:04:04,126
THOUGHTS AND WE ARE GOING TO TRY

133
00:04:04,126 --> 00:04:06,061
TO USE THAT AS WE GO ON, BECAUSE

134
00:04:06,061 --> 00:04:07,830
HE'S COMMENTED ON EVERY ISSUE ON

135
00:04:07,830 --> 00:04:08,831
THE DAY.

136
00:04:08,831 --> 00:04:10,399
AND WE'LL BRING HIM INTO THE

137
00:04:10,399 --> 00:04:13,936
CONVERSATION AS WE GO FORWARD.

138
00:04:13,936 --> 00:04:14,536
>> Laura: BRIT HUME.

139
00:04:14,536 --> 00:04:16,272
>> WE'VE KNOWN THIS WAS COMING

140
00:04:16,272 --> 00:04:17,773
FOR SOME WEEKS NOW.

141
00:04:17,773 --> 00:04:18,540
IT BARELY LESSENS THE SADNESS OF

142
00:04:18,540 --> 00:04:21,377
THIS MOMENT.

143
00:04:21,377 --> 00:04:22,745
BUT WHAT THAT MEANS IS, CHARLES

144
00:04:22,745 --> 00:04:24,213
HAD A CHANCE, IN THE LAST FEW

145
00:04:24,213 --> 00:04:27,249
WEEKS OF HIS LIFE, TO HEAR HOW

146
00:04:27,249 --> 00:04:29,318
WE ALL FELT ABOUT HIM.

147
00:04:29,318 --> 00:04:31,553

00:04:31,553 --> 00:04:32,821

IT WASN'T THAT HE WAS JUST SO

151
00:04:35,991 --> 00:04:37,359
BRILLIANT, ALTHOUGH HE WAS, HE

152
00:04:37,359 --> 00:04:39,561
WAS ALSO SO VERY KIND AND FUNNY,

153
00:04:39,561 --> 00:04:40,195
AND WE LOVED HIM.

154
00:04:40,195 --> 00:04:42,731
ALL OF US AROUND HERE LOVED HIM.

155
00:04:42,731 --> 00:04:43,966
THOSE OF US WHO MIGHT BE

156
00:04:43,966 --> 00:04:45,334
CONSIDERED BIG SHOTS LOVED HIM,

00:04:45,334 --> 00:04:47,336
EVERYBODY IS LOVE HIM, AS WELL.

158
00:04:47,336 --> 00:04:48,904
I HOPE YOU KNEW THAT, I SUSPECT

159
00:04:48,904 --> 00:04:51,740
HE DID, AND I'M GLAD HE DID FOR

160
00:04:51,740 --> 00:04:52,041
THAT.

161
00:04:52,041 --> 00:04:52,942
>> Laura: EVERYONE FROM THE

162
00:04:52,942 --> 00:04:53,876
MAKEUP ARTISTS, THE GUYS BEHIND

163
00:04:53,876 --> 00:04:56,812

00:04:56,812 --> 00:04:58,547
WORK, AND WOMEN BEHIND THE

165
00:04:58,547 --> 00:04:59,915
SCENES, EVERYONE KNEW HIM.

166
00:04:59,915 --> 00:05:01,951
HE DIDN'T WANT TO BE TREATED

167
00:05:01,951 --> 00:05:03,652
DIFFERENTLY, THOUGH, THAN ANYONE

168
00:05:03,652 --> 00:05:03,953
ELSE.

169
00:05:03,953 --> 00:05:04,954
YOU POINTED THAT OUT.

170
00:05:04,954 --> 00:05:06,322
>> YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT THE

171
00:05:06,322 --> 00:05:08,757
BRAKES, BACK IN THE DAY,

172
00:05:08,757 --> 00:05:09,725
"SPECIAL REPORT, CHARLES WAS ON,

173
00:05:09,725 --> 00:05:11,894
HE WOULD COME IN EARLIER BECAUSE

174
00:05:11,894 --> 00:05:13,762
OF THE WHEELCHAIR, IT TOOK HIM

175
00:05:13,762 --> 00:05:15,297
EARLIER TO GET INTO POSITION,

176
00:05:15,297 --> 00:05:16,999
WHICH MEANT THAT THEY WERE TWO

177
00:05:16,999 --> 00:05:21,837
COMMERCIAL BREAKS BEFORE THE

178
00:05:21,837 --> 00:05:22,538
TIME, THAT I GOT TO SPEND WITH

179
00:05:22,538 --> 00:05:22,871
CHARLES.

180
00:05:22,871 --> 00:05:23,706
EVERY NOW AND THEN, HE WOULD

181
00:05:23,706 --> 00:05:25,708
SAY, A KIND WORD TO ME ABOUT MY

182
00:05:25,708 --> 00:05:26,108
WORK.

183
00:05:26,108 --> 00:05:27,509
I ALWAYS FELT LIKE THE EARTH AND

184
00:05:27,509 --> 00:05:28,978
EVERYTHING THAT WAS AND IT HAD

185
00:05:28,978 --> 00:05:30,512
JUST BEEN CONFERRED UPON ME WHEN

186
00:05:30,512 --> 00:05:33,148
I GOT A COMPLIMENT FROM

187
00:05:33,148 --> 00:05:35,150
CHARLES KRAUTHAMMER.

188
00:05:35,150 --> 00:05:36,952
>> Laura: A.B., THERE WAS A

189
00:05:36,952 --> 00:05:38,821
MOMENT ON "THE DAILY SHOW" THAT

190
00:05:38,821 --> 00:05:40,255
I HAD NOT SEEN UNTIL JUST BEFORE

191
00:05:40,255 --> 00:05:41,323
THIS SHOW TONIGHT.

192
00:05:41,323 --> 00:05:42,591
I WOULD LIKE YOUR REACTION AND

193
00:05:42,591 --> 00:05:42,958
THOUGHTS.

194
00:05:42,958 --> 00:05:44,326
LET'S WATCH.

195
00:05:44,326 --> 00:05:47,329
>> 30 YEARS.

196
00:05:47,329 --> 00:05:49,164
DO YOU EVER LOOK BACK ON SOME OF

197
00:05:49,164 --> 00:05:50,933
THESE WRITINGS AND THINK, WHAT

198
00:05:50,933 --> 00:05:51,400
WAS I THINKING?

199
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:54,503
>> IT'S WORSE THAN THAT.

200
00:05:54,503 --> 00:05:54,870
[LAUGHTER]

201
00:05:54,870 --> 00:05:56,138
>>  >> GOOD FOR YOU TO SPEAK OFT

202
00:05:56,138 --> 00:05:56,372
>>  >> GOOD FOR YOU TO SPEAK OFE

203
00:05:56,372 --> 00:05:57,940
WORST PART OF WRITING THE BOOK

204
00:05:57,940 --> 00:06:00,743
WAS GOING ALL THE WAY BACK AND

205
00:06:00,743 --> 00:06:02,578
READING THE MILLION WORDS I'VE

206
00:06:02,578 --> 00:06:03,345
WRITTEN, COULDN'T BELIEVE I HAD

207
00:06:03,345 --> 00:06:04,346
WRITTEN SOME OF THAT STUFF.

208
00:06:04,346 --> 00:06:06,615
>> WHAT HAS THE GROWTH PROCESS

209
00:06:06,615 --> 00:06:07,349
BEEN LIKE?

210
00:06:07,349 --> 00:06:09,418
>> THE GROWTH PROCESS, WELL, I

211
00:06:09,418 --> 00:06:14,289
WAS ONCE A LIBERAL.

212
00:06:14,289 --> 00:06:16,859
>> SO THE EARLY WRITINGS SHOWED

213
00:06:16,859 --> 00:06:19,228
HOPE.

214
00:06:19,228 --> 00:06:23,332
>> AND THEN CAME CHANGE.

215
00:06:23,332 --> 00:06:23,799
[LAUGHTER]

216
00:06:23,799 --> 00:06:25,434
>> Laura: I MEAN, A.B., YOU

217
00:06:25,434 --> 00:06:27,903
SAT NEXT TO HIM ON SO MANY

218
00:06:27,903 --> 00:06:28,937
EVENINGS.

219
00:06:28,937 --> 00:06:30,139
>> JUST BRILLIANT.

220
00:06:30,139 --> 00:06:32,174
I WROTE ABOUT HIM LAST WEEKEND I

221
00:06:32,174 --> 00:06:33,742
SAID THAT THE ONLY DEBATE THAT I

222
00:06:33,742 --> 00:06:36,278
EVER WON IN NINE YEARS WAS ON

223
00:06:36,278 --> 00:06:38,347
THE SUPER COMMITTEE, WHICH WAS A

224
00:06:38,347 --> 00:06:39,314
DEBT CUTTING COMMITTEE, WHICH

225
00:06:39,314 --> 00:06:41,517
FELL FLAT ON ITS FACE, HE WROTE

226
00:06:41,517 --> 00:06:42,718
WITH GREAT HOPE ABOUT HOW IT ALL

227
00:06:42,718 --> 00:06:43,919
MIGHT WORK OUT.

228
00:06:43,919 --> 00:06:45,687
IT WAS REALLY GOING TO BE A

229
00:06:45,687 --> 00:06:46,922
GREAT OPPORTUNITY.

230
00:06:46,922 --> 00:06:48,590
WHEN I BUSTED HIM ABOUT IT, WHEN

231
00:06:48,590 --> 00:06:50,092
IT FOLDED, HE SAID THAT WAS ONE

232
00:06:50,092 --> 00:06:52,594
OF THE TIMES WHERE I WASN'T

233
00:06:52,594 --> 00:06:53,495
CYNICAL ENOUGH.

234
00:06:53,495 --> 00:06:56,198
HE WAS NEVER WRONG.

235
00:06:56,198 --> 00:06:58,534
HIS PREDICTION DIDN'T COME TRUE.

236
00:06:58,534 --> 00:06:59,334
USUALLY BECAUSE HE HASN'T BEEN

237
00:06:59,334 --> 00:07:00,903
CYNICAL ENOUGH.

238
00:07:00,903 --> 00:07:02,037
BUT FOR SOMEONE WHO WAS SO

239
00:07:02,037 --> 00:07:05,040
CYNICAL, HE WAS ALSO ALWAYS FULL

240
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:08,010
OF HOPE AND JOY.

241
00:07:08,010 --> 00:07:10,112
AND HE REALLY DELIGHTED IN THE

242
00:07:10,112 --> 00:07:12,748
LITTLE THINGS, AND THAT WAS AN

243
00:07:12,748 --> 00:07:14,917
INCREDIBLE COMBINATION, SO

244
00:07:14,917 --> 00:07:17,319
STOIC, SO STRONG, BECAUSE OF HIS

245
00:07:17,319 --> 00:07:18,554
BATTLE, AND WHAT HE HAD TO

246
00:07:18,554 --> 00:07:21,490
SURMOUNT IN THE WAKE OF IT.

247
00:07:21,490 --> 00:07:23,192
BUT THEN, JUST AS SOMEONE WHO

248
00:07:23,192 --> 00:07:25,494
REALLY DELIGHTED IN THE WARMTH

249
00:07:25,494 --> 00:07:26,495
AND EXCHANGE OF PEOPLE.

250
00:07:26,495 --> 00:07:29,131
HE LOVED PEOPLE.

251
00:07:29,131 --> 00:07:31,333
WE HAD A NIGHT RIGHT HERE AT THE

252
00:07:31,333 --> 00:07:32,501
TABLE, I'LL NEVER FORGET, EARLY

253
00:07:32,501 --> 00:07:33,936
ON WHEN I DIDN'T KNOW HIM WELL,

254
00:07:33,936 --> 00:07:36,738
AND I WAS SEATED IN BETWEEN HIM

255
00:07:36,738 --> 00:07:39,241
AND STEVE AND BRET ARE MAKING

256
00:07:39,241 --> 00:07:39,975
SOME COLLEGE OVER DRINKING

257
00:07:39,975 --> 00:07:44,313
JOKES, AND CHARLES SAID, THAT

258
00:07:44,313 --> 00:07:46,415
COMMERCIAL ALWAYS SAYS TO ME,

259
00:07:46,415 --> 00:07:47,850
THE ONLY BEER TO HAVE WHEN YOU

260
00:07:47,850 --> 00:07:49,551
ARE HAVING MORE THAN ONE.

261
00:07:49,551 --> 00:07:51,353
THEN HE PAUSED PERFECTLY TIMED,

262
00:07:51,353 --> 00:07:53,722
MORE THAN ONE WHAT?

263
00:07:53,722 --> 00:07:55,224
AND THEN OF COURSE, IT WAS RIGHT

264
00:07:55,224 --> 00:07:56,925
BACK TO THE PANEL, AND WE WERE

265
00:07:56,925 --> 00:07:58,727
BACK ON CAMERA, AND I WAS

266
00:07:58,727 --> 00:08:00,529
PRACTICALLY UNDER THE TABLE.

267
00:08:00,529 --> 00:08:01,964
HIS COMEDIC TIMING WAS

268
00:08:01,964 --> 00:08:02,764
UNBELIEVABLE.

269
00:08:02,764 --> 00:08:04,500
ALSO, SOMETIMES, JUST HAD THE

270
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:05,834
DELIGHT OF A SMALL KID.

271
00:08:05,834 --> 00:08:07,136
IT WAS REALLY SOMETHING TO

272
00:08:07,136 --> 00:08:07,469
BEHOLD.

273
00:08:07,469 --> 00:08:11,373
>> Laura: PSYCHIATRIST,

274
00:08:11,373 --> 00:08:12,741
HARVARD MEDICAL SCHOOL, PULITZER

275
00:08:12,741 --> 00:08:13,609
PRIZE, MORE AWARDS THAN WE CAN

276
00:08:13,609 --> 00:08:13,976
LIST HERE.

277
00:08:13,976 --> 00:08:17,679
BUT CHARLES, WHEN HE WROTE ABOUT

278
00:08:17,679 --> 00:08:20,782
A POLITICAL MOVEMENT OR EVENT,

279
00:08:20,782 --> 00:08:24,052
HE WROTE ABOUT IT IN A WAY THAT

280
00:08:24,052 --> 00:08:26,321
HE CUT THROUGH WHERE SO MANY

281
00:08:26,321 --> 00:08:28,957
OTHERS WERE MIRED IN MINUTIA.

282
00:08:28,957 --> 00:08:30,125
PRESIDENT REAGAN, I LOVED THIS

283
00:08:30,125 --> 00:08:31,126
PART, OF COURSE THIS WAS AFTER

284
00:08:31,126 --> 00:08:32,528
REAGAN'S DEATH.

285
00:08:32,528 --> 00:08:34,363
HE WROTE, "OPTIMISM IS OF THE

286
00:08:34,363 --> 00:08:35,731
PERFECT WAY TO TRIVIALIZE

287
00:08:35,731 --> 00:08:37,533
EVERYTHING THAT REAGAN WAS

288
00:08:37,533 --> 00:08:38,332
ORDERED.

289
00:08:38,332 --> 00:08:39,768
OPTIMISM, EVERY OTHER PERSON ON

290
00:08:39,768 --> 00:08:42,404
THE NUMBER SIX BUS IS AN

291
00:08:42,404 --> 00:08:42,770
OPTIMIST.

292
00:08:42,770 --> 00:08:44,206
WHAT DISTINGUISHED REAGAN WAS

293
00:08:44,206 --> 00:08:45,941
WHAT HE DID AND SAID.

294
00:08:45,941 --> 00:08:47,142
REAGAN WAS OPTIMISTIC ABOUT

295
00:08:47,142 --> 00:08:48,544
AMERICA BY THE CYNICISM AND

296
00:08:48,544 --> 00:08:50,913
GENERAL RETREAT OF    OF THE

297
00:08:50,913 --> 00:08:52,714
POST-VIETNAM ERA BECAUSE HE

298
00:08:52,714 --> 00:08:54,049
BELIEVED ON FASHIONABLY THAT

299
00:08:54,049 --> 00:08:56,018
AMERICA WAS BOTH GREAT AND

300
00:08:56,018 --> 00:08:56,318
GOOD."

301
00:08:56,318 --> 00:08:59,121
I LOVE THAT.

302
00:08:59,121 --> 00:09:00,956
LIKE AN OLD UNCLE, REAGAN IS SO

303
00:09:00,956 --> 00:09:03,158
OPTIMISTIC, BUT IT WAS

304
00:09:03,158 --> 00:09:03,959
OPTIMISTIC ABOUT THE GOODNESS OF

305
00:09:03,959 --> 00:09:04,560
AMERICA.

306
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:05,928
I LOVE THE FACT THAT HE POINTED

307
00:09:05,928 --> 00:09:06,295
THAT OUT.

308
00:09:06,295 --> 00:09:09,064
HE WAS ALWAYS CUTTING AGAINST

309
00:09:09,064 --> 00:09:09,698
THE CONVENTIONAL WISDOM.

310
00:09:09,698 --> 00:09:12,868
>> THAT AND OF ITSELF IS THE

311
00:09:12,868 --> 00:09:13,535
OPTIMISTIC VIEW OF AMERICA.

312
00:09:13,535 --> 00:09:17,072
OF COURSE, I HAVE THE PLEASURE

313
00:09:17,072 --> 00:09:17,940
OF KNOWING CHARLES FAR LESS THAN

314
00:09:17,940 --> 00:09:21,043
ANYBODY SITTING AT THIS TABLE,

315
00:09:21,043 --> 00:09:23,512
BUT I REMEMBER BEING A YOUNGER

316
00:09:23,512 --> 00:09:25,214
BOY, GROWING UP IN A SMALL TOWN,

317
00:09:25,214 --> 00:09:28,917
AND WE GOT

318
00:09:28,917 --> 00:09:29,585
"THE WASHINGTON POST," AND I

319
00:09:29,585 --> 00:09:31,887
REMEMBER MY FATHER WOULD RIP OUT

320
00:09:31,887 --> 00:09:32,821
HIS COLUMNS AND SEND THEM TO ME,

321
00:09:32,821 --> 00:09:37,125
GIVE THEM TO ME, AND THAT HAD A

322
00:09:37,125 --> 00:09:37,960
PROFOUND IMPACT ON MY INTEREST

323
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:40,862
IN NEWSPAPERS, AND OBVIOUSLY

324
00:09:40,862 --> 00:09:42,164
POLITICS.

325
00:09:42,164 --> 00:09:43,999
HE WAS OBVIOUSLY BRILLIANT,

326
00:09:43,999 --> 00:09:44,766
FUNNY, ALL OF THESE THINGS PRAY

327
00:09:44,766 --> 00:09:46,068
THAT THE TITLE OF HIS BOOK,

328
00:09:46,068 --> 00:09:49,037
"THINGS THAT MATTER," WAS THE

329
00:09:49,037 --> 00:09:52,140
MOST PERFECT TITLE OF A BOOK FOR

330
00:09:52,140 --> 00:09:52,908
HIM, BECAUSE WHAT HE DID BETTER

331
00:09:52,908 --> 00:09:56,111
THAN ANYTHING ELSE WAS TO CUT

332
00:09:56,111 --> 00:09:57,145
THROUGH ALL THE NOISE AND PUT

333
00:09:57,145 --> 00:10:00,349
EVERYTHING INTO PERSPECTIVE,

334
00:10:00,349 --> 00:10:01,817
WITH THE THINGS THAT WERE

335
00:10:01,817 --> 00:10:05,387
IMPORTANT, AND THE THINGS THAT

336
00:10:05,387 --> 00:10:05,921
MATTERED.

337
00:10:05,921 --> 00:10:08,523
>> THAT BOOK WAS A COLLECTION.

338
00:10:08,523 --> 00:10:09,992
COLLECTIONS DON'T SELL.

339
00:10:09,992 --> 00:10:11,326
>> Laura: IT WAS ON THE

340
00:10:11,326 --> 00:10:12,661
BEST SELLER LIST FOR A YEAR AND

341
00:10:12,661 --> 00:10:13,161
A HALF.

342
00:10:13,161 --> 00:10:14,563
>> THAT SOLD LIKE HOT CAKES FOR

343
00:10:14,563 --> 00:10:14,930
YEARS.

344
00:10:14,930 --> 00:10:16,231
I THINK PEOPLE ARE STILL BUYING

345
00:10:16,231 --> 00:10:16,531
IT.

346
00:10:16,531 --> 00:10:18,033
I GOT A COPY OF IT.

347
00:10:18,033 --> 00:10:20,135
>> I WAS ON THE TRAIN COMING

348
00:10:20,135 --> 00:10:21,036
FROM NEW YORK YESTERDAY, THERE

349
00:10:21,036 --> 00:10:22,537
WAS A GUY SITTING THERE READING

350
00:10:22,537 --> 00:10:22,938
THAT BOOK.

351
00:10:22,938 --> 00:10:25,941
>> Laura: I WANT TO MENTION

352
00:10:25,941 --> 00:10:27,676
BRET'S SPECIAL, PEOPLE HAVE TO

353
00:10:27,676 --> 00:10:29,211
TAKE THAT HOUR AND SIT DOWN, IT

354
00:10:29,211 --> 00:10:31,546
IS ABSOLUTELY BREATHTAKING.

355
00:10:31,546 --> 00:10:33,415
TOMORROW NIGHT, 9:00 P.M. ON

356
00:10:33,415 --> 00:10:35,384
FOX NEWS, I CAN'T WAIT TO WATCH

357
00:10:35,384 --> 00:10:35,917
IT.

358
00:10:35,917 --> 00:10:37,753
I'VE SEEN BITS AND PIECES, BUT I

359
00:10:37,753 --> 00:10:39,521
HAVEN'T SEEN THE WHOLE THING.

360
00:10:39,521 --> 00:10:40,989
BRET, THE NIGHT AFTER NIGHT

361
00:10:40,989 --> 00:10:42,524
AFTER NIGHT, ELECTION NIGHT,

362
00:10:42,524 --> 00:10:46,728
PRIMARY NIGHT, KRAUTHAMMER WAS

363
00:10:46,728 --> 00:10:47,462
TOUGH ON THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN BUT

364
00:10:47,462 --> 00:10:50,332
ALSO VERY FAIR.

365
00:10:50,332 --> 00:10:51,867
HE AND I GOT INTO SOME LEGENDARY

366
00:10:51,867 --> 00:10:54,436
BATTLES ON THE PANEL IN THE

367
00:10:54,436 --> 00:10:57,539
RUN-UP TO THE ELECTION, WITH

368
00:10:57,539 --> 00:10:58,640
GEORGE WILL, HIS BEST FRIEND,

369
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:01,543
AND IT WAS A SPIRITED DEBATE,

370
00:11:01,543 --> 00:11:02,778
WAS ALWAYS SO MUCH FUN, THERE.

371
00:11:02,778 --> 00:11:04,579
HE WAS SUCH A GREAT SPARRING

372
00:11:04,579 --> 00:11:05,580
PARTNER ON THE ISSUE OF RISING

373
00:11:05,580 --> 00:11:09,718
POPULISM VERSUS THE OLD BUSH

374
00:11:09,718 --> 00:11:11,787
GLOBALISM, INTERVENTIONISM.

375
00:11:11,787 --> 00:11:12,821
HE LOVED THE PHILOSOPHICAL BACK

376
00:11:12,821 --> 00:11:16,692
AND FORTH THAT I THINK MAKES

377
00:11:16,692 --> 00:11:17,526
"SPECIAL REPORT" SUCH AN

378
00:11:17,526 --> 00:11:19,094
IMPORTANT SHOW TO HAVE FEATURED

379
00:11:19,094 --> 00:11:19,461
HIM.

380
00:11:19,461 --> 00:11:20,162
I KNOW BRIT HUME WAS THE FIRST

381
00:11:20,162 --> 00:11:23,065
ONE TO REALLY PUT HIM ON THE

382
00:11:23,065 --> 00:11:24,700
SHOW, AND THAT MADE THE

383
00:11:24,700 --> 00:11:27,736
DIFFERENCE ON THAT PANEL.

384
00:11:27,736 --> 00:11:29,304
HE REALLY -- I KNOW YOU'VE

385
00:11:29,304 --> 00:11:29,971
MISSED HIM SINCE, WE'VE ALL

386
00:11:29,971 --> 00:11:33,342
MISSED HIM HERE AT FOX.

387
00:11:33,342 --> 00:11:34,443
>> YEAH.

388
00:11:34,443 --> 00:11:37,679
HE REALLY WAS A POWERHOUSE.

389
00:11:37,679 --> 00:11:39,815
HE LOVED GETTING INTO THE

390
00:11:39,815 --> 00:11:40,282
POLITICS.

391
00:11:40,282 --> 00:11:43,085
HE LOVED ENGAGING WITH YOU AND

392
00:11:43,085 --> 00:11:44,186
TUCKER AND OTHERS ON THE ISSUES

393
00:11:44,186 --> 00:11:48,457
OF THE DAY POLITICALLY

394
00:11:48,457 --> 00:11:48,490
OF THE DAY POLITICALLY         P

395
00:11:48,490 --> 00:11:48,523
OF THE DAY POLITICALLY         L

396
00:11:48,523 --> 00:11:48,557
OF THE DAY POLITICALLY         T

397
00:11:48,557 --> 00:11:48,590
OF THE DAY POLITICALLY         C

398
00:11:48,590 --> 00:11:48,623
OF THE DAY POLITICALLY         L

399
00:11:48,623 --> 00:11:48,657
OF THE DAY POLITICALLY         I

400
00:11:48,657 --> 00:11:48,990
OF THE DAY POLITICALLY         E

401
00:11:48,990 --> 00:11:51,093
OF THE DAY POLITICALLY         .

402
00:11:51,093 --> 00:11:52,461
I TRIED TO GET PANELISTS TO PUT

403
00:11:52,461 --> 00:11:55,130
CHIPS AND BETS ON POTENTIAL

404
00:11:55,130 --> 00:11:55,697
CANDIDATES.

405
00:11:55,697 --> 00:11:58,900
WE HAD 17 IN THE BEGINNING OF

406
00:11:58,900 --> 00:12:00,102
THIS PROCESS, REPUBLICANS.

407
00:12:00,102 --> 00:12:02,904
SO HE DID NOT PUT ANY MONEY ON

408
00:12:02,904 --> 00:12:05,107
TRUMP AND EVENTUALLY, HE WAS

409
00:12:05,107 --> 00:12:05,974
BEGRUDGINGLY PUTTING FIVE AND

410
00:12:05,974 --> 00:12:10,479
TEN, AND HE WAS     WOULD ALWAYS

411
00:12:10,479 --> 00:12:10,512
TEN, AND HE WAS     WOULD ALWAYP

412
00:12:10,512 --> 00:12:10,679
TEN, AND HE WAS     WOULD ALWAYT

413
00:12:10,679 --> 00:12:11,012
TEN, AND HE WAS     WOULD ALWAYA

414
00:12:11,012 --> 00:12:12,914
FIVE CHIP ON ONE WOMEN IN ZONE,

415
00:12:12,914 --> 00:12:15,884
AND HE JUST HAD A GREAT TIME

416
00:12:15,884 --> 00:12:16,218
WITH IT.

417
00:12:16,218 --> 00:12:19,454
HE WAS SOMEBODY WHO I THINK

418
00:12:19,454 --> 00:12:21,923
TOUCHED PEOPLE IN A WAY THAT,

419
00:12:21,923 --> 00:12:24,025
EVEN IF YOU DIDN'T AGREE WITH

420
00:12:24,025 --> 00:12:26,495
HIM, YOU KIND OF NODDED YOUR

421
00:12:26,495 --> 00:12:28,697
HEAD AND SAID, ALL RIGHT, I GET

422
00:12:28,697 --> 00:12:30,899
THAT.

423
00:12:30,899 --> 00:12:32,501
>> Laura: BRIT, TRUMP, WE

424
00:12:32,501 --> 00:12:33,902
THINK ABOUT WHAT IS HAPPENING

425
00:12:33,902 --> 00:12:35,504
WITH THE BIG IMMIGRATION DEBATE,

426
00:12:35,504 --> 00:12:36,905
SEPARATING THE FAMILIES, I JUST

427
00:12:36,905 --> 00:12:38,540
WANT TO KNOW WHAT KRAUTHAMMER

428
00:12:38,540 --> 00:12:39,107
WOULD BE SAYING.

429
00:12:39,107 --> 00:12:40,642
>> ME, TOO.

430
00:12:40,642 --> 00:12:43,111
>> Laura: WHAT WOULD HE SAY

431
00:12:43,111 --> 00:12:44,946
ABOUT THE NAZI CONCENTRATION

432
00:12:44,946 --> 00:12:46,181
CAMP ISSUE?

433
00:12:46,181 --> 00:12:49,484
>> HE WAS OFFENDED BY TRUMP.

434
00:12:49,484 --> 00:12:49,885
IN ANY WAY.

435
00:12:49,885 --> 00:12:52,421
>> Laura: LET'S BE HONEST, HE

436
00:12:52,421 --> 00:12:54,322
THOUGHT, AS DOES GEORGE WILL,

437
00:12:54,322 --> 00:12:55,757
TRUMP IS A HORRIBLE BULGARIAN.

438
00:12:55,757 --> 00:12:57,726
HE DID BELIEVE THAT.

439
00:12:57,726 --> 00:12:58,226
LET'S BE HONEST.

440
00:12:58,226 --> 00:13:03,765
>> HE THOUGHT HE WAS IGNORANT

441
00:13:03,765 --> 00:13:04,332
AND ADVANTAGEOUS.

442
00:13:04,332 --> 00:13:05,734
>> Laura: NO LOVE LOST.

443
00:13:05,734 --> 00:13:07,936
>> ONCE TRUMP WAS NOMINATED AND

444
00:13:07,936 --> 00:13:09,037
BECAME PRESIDENT, I THINK

445
00:13:09,037 --> 00:13:10,405
CHARLES, LIKE SOME OF THE REST

446
00:13:10,405 --> 00:13:11,740
OF US, WAS DEEPLY OFFENDED BY

447
00:13:11,740 --> 00:13:13,241
THE COVERAGE OF HIM.

448
00:13:13,241 --> 00:13:15,544
HE WAS VERY FAIR TO TRUMP DURING

449
00:13:15,544 --> 00:13:16,912
THE COURSE OF HIS PRESIDENCY,

450
00:13:16,912 --> 00:13:17,846
FOR AS LONG AS CHARLES WAS ABLE

451
00:13:17,846 --> 00:13:21,483
TO WITNESS IT, A YEAR BEFORE WE

452
00:13:21,483 --> 00:13:22,150
LOST THEM TO THIS TERRIBLE

453
00:13:22,150 --> 00:13:23,785
ILLNESS.

454
00:13:23,785 --> 00:13:26,922
>> Laura: HE HAD A COLUMN IN

455
00:13:26,922 --> 00:13:30,125
2011, A.B., CALLED "ALONE IN THE

456
00:13:30,125 --> 00:13:30,959
UNIVERSE," ONE OF THE COLUMNS,

457
00:13:30,959 --> 00:13:32,360
USING THE TITLE, YOU GOT TO READ

458
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:32,627
IT.

459
00:13:32,627 --> 00:13:34,296
I WENT BACK AND READ IT TODAY.

460
00:13:34,296 --> 00:13:36,731
TALKING ABOUT HOW MANY GALAXIES,

461
00:13:36,731 --> 00:13:37,432
CONSTELLATIONS, LIFE ON OTHER

462
00:13:37,432 --> 00:13:38,900
PLANETS AND SO FORTH.

463
00:13:38,900 --> 00:13:41,503
HE SAID AT THE END, "WE GROW

464
00:13:41,503 --> 00:13:42,737
JUSTLY WEARY OF OUR POLITICS BUT

465
00:13:42,737 --> 00:13:45,140
WE MUST OR MEMBER THIS.

466
00:13:45,140 --> 00:13:48,376
POLITICS, AND ALEX GRUBBY,

467
00:13:48,376 --> 00:13:50,378
GRASPING, CORRUPT, CONTEMPTIBLE

468
00:13:50,378 --> 00:13:52,147
MANIFESTATIONS, IS SOVEREIGN

469
00:13:52,147 --> 00:13:52,948
IN HUMAN AFFAIRS.

470
00:13:52,948 --> 00:13:54,182
EVERYTHING ULTIMATELY RESTS UPON

471
00:13:54,182 --> 00:13:56,952
IT, FAIRLY OR NOT, POLITICS IS

472
00:13:56,952 --> 00:14:00,088
THE DRIVER OF HISTORY."

473
00:14:00,088 --> 00:14:00,789
I THINK I WOULD DEBATE HIM ON

474
00:14:00,789 --> 00:14:01,456
THAT BECAUSE I DON'T KNOW IF

475
00:14:01,456 --> 00:14:02,557
POLITICS IS THAT IMPORTANT TO

476
00:14:02,557 --> 00:14:04,292
MOST PEOPLE'S LIVES.

477
00:14:04,292 --> 00:14:06,495
BUT IT WAS IMPORTANT TO HIM AND

478
00:14:06,495 --> 00:14:07,929
HE THOUGHT THE DEBATES THAT WE

479
00:14:07,929 --> 00:14:10,699
WERE HAVING, OF COURSE THAT WAS

480
00:14:10,699 --> 00:14:12,501
2011, DURING THE OBAMA

481
00:14:12,501 --> 00:14:13,168
ADMINISTRATION, ALL THE BIG

482
00:14:13,168 --> 00:14:14,669
QUESTIONS ABOUT HOW WE HANDLE

483
00:14:14,669 --> 00:14:16,671
TERROR AND OTHER COUNTRIES,

484
00:14:16,671 --> 00:14:18,273
FOREIGN AFFAIRS, WERE VERY

485
00:14:18,273 --> 00:14:18,640
IMPORTANT.

486
00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:20,408
BUT HE ALWAYS HAD A VERY

487
00:14:20,408 --> 00:14:22,110
INTERESTING CLINICAL TAKE TO MY

488
00:14:22,110 --> 00:14:23,512
PSYCHIATRIST TAKE ON THE

489
00:14:23,512 --> 00:14:24,779
AFTERLIFE, WHETHER THERE WAS AN

490
00:14:24,779 --> 00:14:25,313
AFTERLIFE.

491
00:14:25,313 --> 00:14:26,948
I JUST WONDER, LIKE, I JUST WANT

492
00:14:26,948 --> 00:14:27,649
TO HAVE A CONVERSATION ABOUT

493
00:14:27,649 --> 00:14:28,283
THIS.

494
00:14:28,283 --> 00:14:30,018
WHEN I READ THIS, I WAS LIKE,

495
00:14:30,018 --> 00:14:32,220
THIS IS WHY I LOVED BEING ON

496
00:14:32,220 --> 00:14:32,721
WITH KRAUTHAMMER.

497
00:14:32,721 --> 00:14:33,755
>> WE ALL DO.

498
00:14:33,755 --> 00:14:35,524
THAT WAS WHAT IT WAS A WONDERFUL

499
00:14:35,524 --> 00:14:37,259
ABOUT HIS COLUMNS, THEY WOULD GO

500
00:14:37,259 --> 00:14:38,660
OFF ON ALL THESE OTHER HUGE --

501
00:14:38,660 --> 00:14:39,961
>> Laura: BEING A FATHER.

502
00:14:39,961 --> 00:14:42,797
>> THE PERSPECTIVE WAS SO BROAD.

503
00:14:42,797 --> 00:14:44,399
THE THING ABOUT HOW MUCH HE

504
00:14:44,399 --> 00:14:45,901
LOVED POLITICS AND BELIEVED IT

505
00:14:45,901 --> 00:14:47,702
WAS AN IMPORTANT DEBATE, AND THE

506
00:14:47,702 --> 00:14:50,138
DISCOURSE WAS SO IMPORTANT, EVEN

507
00:14:50,138 --> 00:14:51,039
THOUGH IT'S ERODED AND DEGRADED

508
00:14:51,039 --> 00:14:54,876
SO RAPIDLY, HE REALLY BELIEVED

509
00:14:54,876 --> 00:14:56,077
THAT EVERYONE SHOULD BE

510
00:14:56,077 --> 00:14:58,146
PERSUADABLE, AT LEAST AROUND THE

511
00:14:58,146 --> 00:14:58,480
EDGES.

512
00:14:58,480 --> 00:14:59,881
HE DIDN'T LIKE PEOPLE WHO

513
00:14:59,881 --> 00:15:03,218
WEREN'T WILLING TO JUST BE

514
00:15:03,218 --> 00:15:05,086
PERSUADED A BIT HERE AND THERE.

515
00:15:05,086 --> 00:15:07,556
AND SO HE TRIED TO BRING THAT TO

516
00:15:07,556 --> 00:15:07,989
HIS ARGUMENT.

517
00:15:07,989 --> 00:15:09,291
MOST OF THE TIME IT WORKS ON

518
00:15:09,291 --> 00:15:09,925
PEOPLE.

519
00:15:09,925 --> 00:15:11,693
THEY WOULD SAY, EVEN IF I DIDN'T

520
00:15:11,693 --> 00:15:12,928
AGREE AT THE END, I REALLY SAW

521
00:15:12,928 --> 00:15:15,530
HOW WELL HE MADE THE POINT.

522
00:15:15,530 --> 00:15:16,731
SO HE ENGAGED THEM.

523
00:15:16,731 --> 00:15:18,099
AND THAT WAS AN ART OF

524
00:15:18,099 --> 00:15:19,134
PERSUASION AND ITSELF.

525
00:15:19,134 --> 00:15:20,068
>> Laura: CHARLIE, YOU WORKED

526
00:15:20,068 --> 00:15:22,237
IN A LOT OF COLUMNS IN YOUR DAY,

527
00:15:22,237 --> 00:15:25,173
ON BEING A COLUMNIST, HE WROTE,

528
00:15:25,173 --> 00:15:26,441
"LONGEVITY FOR A COLUMNIST IS A

529
00:15:26,441 --> 00:15:28,977
SIMPLE PROPOSITION, ONCE YOU

530
00:15:28,977 --> 00:15:29,744
START, YOU DON'T STOP.

531
00:15:29,744 --> 00:15:31,613
YOU DO IT UNTIL YOU DIE OR CAN

532
00:15:31,613 --> 00:15:32,981
NO LONGER PUT A SENTENCE

533
00:15:32,981 --> 00:15:33,381
TOGETHER.

534
00:15:33,381 --> 00:15:34,749
IT HAS ALWAYS BEEN MY INTENTION

535
00:15:34,749 --> 00:15:37,719
TO DIE AT MY DESK, ALTHOUGH MY

536
00:15:37,719 --> 00:15:39,988
MOST CHERISHED AMBITION IS TO

537
00:15:39,988 --> 00:15:42,190
OUTLIVE THE ESTATE TAX."

538
00:15:42,190 --> 00:15:43,625
WELL, HE ALMOST DID.

539
00:15:43,625 --> 00:15:44,593
WE'VE DOUBLED THE ESTATE

540
00:15:44,593 --> 00:15:46,928
EXEMPTION, SO HE DID PRETTY WELL

541
00:15:46,928 --> 00:15:48,663
ON THAT.

542
00:15:48,663 --> 00:15:50,465
AGAIN, HUMOR IN THE FACE OF

543
00:15:50,465 --> 00:15:51,166
DIFFICULTY, AND I DON'T KNOW.

544
00:15:51,166 --> 00:15:54,302
THAT WAS JUST ANOTHER.

545
00:15:54,302 --> 00:15:55,670
>> I THINK HE WOULD AGREE WITH

546
00:15:55,670 --> 00:15:57,939
YOU IN TERMS OF POLITICS IS NOT

547
00:15:57,939 --> 00:15:59,541
WHAT EVERYTHING IS ABOUT.

548
00:15:59,541 --> 00:16:02,477
HE IS RIGHT, POLITICS IS ABOUT

549
00:16:02,477 --> 00:16:04,746
POWER, WHO CAN GOVERN, IN THAT

550
00:16:04,746 --> 00:16:05,347
RESPECT, IT IS THE MOST

551
00:16:05,347 --> 00:16:06,047
IMPORTANT THING BECAUSE IT IS

552
00:16:06,047 --> 00:16:08,350
HOW WE DETERMINE WHAT RIGHTS WE

553
00:16:08,350 --> 00:16:08,683
HAVE.

554
00:16:08,683 --> 00:16:10,785
AT THE END OF THE DAY, HE WANTED

555
00:16:10,785 --> 00:16:11,886
TO GO TO A BASEBALL GAME.

556
00:16:11,886 --> 00:16:12,921
HE WOULD HAVE LOVED TO HAVE BEEN

557
00:16:12,921 --> 00:16:16,925
AT THE GAME TONIGHT, HE WOULD

558
00:16:16,925 --> 00:16:18,059
