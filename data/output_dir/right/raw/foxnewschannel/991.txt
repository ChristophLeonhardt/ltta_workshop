1
00:00:02,053 --> 00:00:03,688
ADDRESSED.

2
00:00:03,688 --> 00:00:04,722
TECHNICALLY CONCLUDED WITH A

3
00:00:04,722 --> 00:00:05,857
TRUCE AND NEVER REPLACED BY A

4
00:00:05,857 --> 00:00:06,391
FORMAL PEACE TREATY.

5
00:00:06,391 --> 00:00:09,360
LET'S TALK ABOUT THAT.

6
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:14,165
RETIRED FOUR-STAR GENERAL

7
00:00:14,165 --> 00:00:14,566
JACK KEANE.

8
00:00:14,566 --> 00:00:17,068
GOOD TO HAVE YOU.

9
00:00:17,068 --> 00:00:19,037
>> GOOD TO SEE YOU.

10
00:00:19,037 --> 00:00:19,904
>> Shannon: LET'S TALK ABOUT

11
00:00:19,904 --> 00:00:21,239
WHAT WE'VE SEEN TONIGHT.

12
00:00:21,239 --> 00:00:25,176
MONTHS AGO, THEY WERE CARRYING

13
00:00:25,176 --> 00:00:27,478
OUT BALLISTIC MISSILE TESTS.

14
00:00:27,478 --> 00:00:28,580
NUCLEAR TESTS.

15
00:00:28,580 --> 00:00:29,714
YOU'VE BEEN ONE OF THE ONCE, NO

16
00:00:29,714 --> 00:00:31,583
MATTER HOW MANY TIMES I ASKED,

17
00:00:31,583 --> 00:00:32,951
YOU THOUGHT THIS MEETING WOULD

18
00:00:32,951 --> 00:00:33,451
COME TO FRUITION.

19
00:00:33,451 --> 00:00:34,686
WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF WHAT WE HAVE

20
00:00:34,686 --> 00:00:38,623
SEEN SO FAR.

21
00:00:38,623 --> 00:00:39,657
>> I THINK WE ARE GETTING OFF ON

22
00:00:39,657 --> 00:00:42,994
THE RIGHT FOOT.

23
00:00:42,994 --> 00:00:43,628
KIM JONG UN REQUESTED THE

24
00:00:43,628 --> 00:00:46,431
ONE-ON-ONE MEETING.

25
00:00:46,431 --> 00:00:46,931
INTERPRETERS ONLY.

26
00:00:46,931 --> 00:00:48,266
I THINK HE REALLY WANTED TO GET

27
00:00:48,266 --> 00:00:50,235
A FEEL FOR THE PRESIDENT AND GET

28
00:00:50,235 --> 00:00:54,038
HIMSELF COMFORTABLE.

29
00:00:54,038 --> 00:00:55,273
SAVING FACE IS A MAJOR ISSUE.

30
00:00:55,273 --> 00:00:57,342
I DON'T THINK HE WANTED TO SHOW

31
00:00:57,342 --> 00:00:58,843
ANY DISCOMFORT IN FRONT OF HIS

32
00:00:58,843 --> 00:01:00,578
OWN ADVISORS AND THAT'S WHY HE

33
00:01:00,578 --> 00:01:02,447
WANTED THE ONE-ON-ONE MEETING.

34
00:01:02,447 --> 00:01:04,482
NOT SO MUCH TO ACCOMPLISH MAJOR

35
00:01:04,482 --> 00:01:05,250
SUBSTANTIVE ISSUES BUT TO GET TO

36
00:01:05,250 --> 00:01:07,418
KNOW EACH OTHER.

37
00:01:07,418 --> 00:01:11,322
WHAT I THINK IS HAPPENING HERE

38
00:01:11,322 --> 00:01:14,259
IS KIM JONG UN'S ADVISORS AND

39
00:01:14,259 --> 00:01:14,993
KIM JONG UN HIMSELF HAS ALREADY

40
00:01:14,993 --> 00:01:18,496
TOLD SECRETARY POMPEO HE IS

41
00:01:18,496 --> 00:01:19,297
WANTING TO DENUCLEARIZE.

42
00:01:19,297 --> 00:01:21,666
THE PROOF OF THAT AND I THINK

43
00:01:21,666 --> 00:01:23,635
THAT'S WHY PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS

44
00:01:23,635 --> 00:01:25,737
SHOWN SOME OPTIMISM ABOUT THE

45
00:01:25,737 --> 00:01:26,337
SUMMIT THAT'S UNDERWAY.

46
00:01:26,337 --> 00:01:28,539
THE REAL ISSUE WILL BE HOW DO WE

47
00:01:28,539 --> 00:01:33,144
TELL IF THAT'S ACTUALLY GOING TO

48
00:01:33,144 --> 00:01:33,845
COME TO PASS?

49
00:01:33,845 --> 00:01:34,279
HERE'S HOW.

50
00:01:34,279 --> 00:01:37,015
WE INTO A DISCUSSION.

51
00:01:37,015 --> 00:01:40,051
YOU HAVE TO IDENTIFY AND LOCATE

52
00:01:40,051 --> 00:01:41,886
FOR US YOUR NUCLEAR ARSENAL.

53
00:01:41,886 --> 00:01:45,390
I MEAN THEY HAVE TEN TO 20

54
00:01:45,390 --> 00:01:45,723
WEAPONS.

55
00:01:45,723 --> 00:01:47,058
WE DON'T KNOW WHERE ALL OF THEM

56
00:01:47,058 --> 00:01:47,859
ARE.

57
00:01:47,859 --> 00:01:49,360
THEY HAVE TO IDENTIFY AND LOCATE

58
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:51,029
WHERE THOSE WERE BIZARRE, WHERE

59
00:01:51,029 --> 00:01:52,864
THE FUEL SITES ARE FOR THE

60
00:01:52,864 --> 00:01:54,666
WEAPONS, FOR THE RESEARCH SITES

61
00:01:54,666 --> 00:01:57,201
ARE, THE STORAGE SITES.

62
00:01:57,201 --> 00:01:58,836
THEY'VE GOT 70 TO 80 BALLISTIC

63
00:01:58,836 --> 00:01:59,203
MISSILES.

64
00:01:59,203 --> 00:02:00,438
WE KNOW WHERE MOST OF THEM ARE

65
00:02:00,438 --> 00:02:02,440
BUT NOT FOR ALL OF THEM ARE.

66
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:05,610
THEY HAVE TO IDENTIFY AND LOCATE

67
00:02:05,610 --> 00:02:06,844
THAT THROUGH US.

68
00:02:06,844 --> 00:02:11,215
THAT'S WHEN YOU START TO SEE THE

69
00:02:11,215 --> 00:02:12,583
POSSIBILITY THAT THIS WILL BE

70
00:02:12,583 --> 00:02:13,985
SUCCESSFUL IF THEY ARE WILLING

71
00:02:13,985 --> 00:02:16,454
TO COME FORWARD WITH THAT

72
00:02:16,454 --> 00:02:18,256
INFORMATION WHICH IS AFTER ALL

73
00:02:18,256 --> 00:02:20,058
THEIR MOST SECRET AND GUARDED

74
00:02:20,058 --> 00:02:20,658
INFORMATION.

75
00:02:20,658 --> 00:02:21,659
>> Shannon: WHAT THEY FEEL

76
00:02:21,659 --> 00:02:23,361
GUARANTEES THE SAFETY OF THEIR

77
00:02:23,361 --> 00:02:23,995
REGIME.

78
00:02:23,995 --> 00:02:25,330
YOU HAVE TO IMAGINE IT'S GOING

79
00:02:25,330 --> 00:02:28,433
TO BE A GOOD DEAL FOR THEM.

80
00:02:28,433 --> 00:02:30,635
I WANT TO REDO SOMETHING FROM A

81
00:02:30,635 --> 00:02:32,437
COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY LAW

82
00:02:32,437 --> 00:02:36,641
PROFESSOR.

83
00:02:36,641 --> 00:02:37,508
IN THE "LOS ANGELES TIMES" HE

84
00:02:37,508 --> 00:02:40,044
SAYS "IF YOU SIGN A PEACE TREATY

85
00:02:40,044 --> 00:02:41,813
WITHOUT DENUCLEARIZATION, YOU

86
00:02:41,813 --> 00:02:44,048
WERE GIVING DE FACTO RECOGNITION

87
00:02:44,048 --> 00:02:44,882
TO NORTH KOREA AS A NUCLEAR

88
00:02:44,882 --> 00:02:45,783
STATE.

89
00:02:45,783 --> 00:02:47,051
YOU ARE GIVING NORTH KOREA

90
00:02:47,051 --> 00:02:48,286
EXACTLY WHAT IT WANTS AND

91
00:02:48,286 --> 00:02:51,856
PERPETUATING THE PROBLEM."

92
00:02:51,856 --> 00:02:53,057
WE HAVE DISCUSSED, ONE OF THE

93
00:02:53,057 --> 00:02:57,261
MAIN GOALS THE CONVERSATION.

94
00:02:57,261 --> 00:02:59,263
>> NO DOUBT ABOUT IT.

95
00:02:59,263 --> 00:03:01,632
WHAT COULD LIKELY HAPPEN AS A

96
00:03:01,632 --> 00:03:03,501
RESULT OF THIS SUMMIT IS TO

97
00:03:03,501 --> 00:03:05,703
BEGIN THE PROCESS THAT WOULD

98
00:03:05,703 --> 00:03:06,904
LEAD TO ENDING THE KOREAN WAR

99
00:03:06,904 --> 00:03:08,473
AND THE ARMISTICE WHICH LEADS

100
00:03:08,473 --> 00:03:09,273
ALSO TO A PEACE TREATY.

101
00:03:09,273 --> 00:03:12,076
IN OTHER WORDS, WE COMMIT TO THE

102
00:03:12,076 --> 00:03:12,510
PROCESS.

103
00:03:12,510 --> 00:03:15,780
WE DON'T COMMIT TO THE END

104
00:03:15,780 --> 00:03:16,080
STATE.

105
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:17,315
BUT ABSOLUTELY THE INTERMEDIATE

106
00:03:17,315 --> 00:03:19,417
OBJECTIVE THAT HAS TO BE

107
00:03:19,417 --> 00:03:21,619
ACHIEVED BEFORE ANY PEACE TREATY

108
00:03:21,619 --> 00:03:22,987
IS BROUGHT FOR RATIFICATION IS

109
00:03:22,987 --> 00:03:25,690
THE DENUCLEARIZATION OF

110
00:03:25,690 --> 00:03:26,891
NORTH KOREA.

111
00:03:26,891 --> 00:03:28,593
THAT'S AN ABSOLUTE IMPERATIVE.

112
00:03:28,593 --> 00:03:30,862
THE TRUMP TEAM IS VERY COGNIZANT

113
00:03:30,862 --> 00:03:32,196
OF THAT FACT.

114
00:03:32,196 --> 00:03:35,466
THEY WILL NOT TRADE AWAY A PEACE

115
00:03:35,466 --> 00:03:36,934
TREATY AND ENDING THE WAR PRIOR

116
00:03:36,934 --> 00:03:37,468
TO DENUCLEARIZATION.

117
00:03:37,468 --> 00:03:39,437
WHAT THEY WILL DO IS COMMIT TO

118
00:03:39,437 --> 00:03:39,837
THE PROCESS.

119
00:03:39,837 --> 00:03:42,807
THE OTHER THING THEY CAN COMMIT

120
00:03:42,807 --> 00:03:44,942
TO IS A PROCESS OF NORMALIZATION

121
00:03:44,942 --> 00:03:45,877
WITH NORTH KOREA.

122
00:03:45,877 --> 00:03:48,446
SO WE CAN EXCHANGE LIAISON

123
00:03:48,446 --> 00:03:48,980
OFFICERS ET CETERA.

124
00:03:48,980 --> 00:03:50,248
THAT'S JUST A PROCESS.

125
00:03:50,248 --> 00:03:51,883
THERE IS A LOT OF THINGS THAT

126
00:03:51,883 --> 00:03:53,818
CAN BE ACCOMPLISHED AT THE

127
00:03:53,818 --> 00:03:55,420
SUMMIT THAT PUTS IN MOTION WHAT

128
00:03:55,420 --> 00:03:59,123
IS THE ULTIMATE OBJECTIVE FOR

129
00:03:59,123 --> 00:04:01,893
THE UNITED STATES WHICH IS

130
00:04:01,893 --> 00:04:03,261
DENUCLEARIZATION THAT'S COMPLETE

131
00:04:03,261 --> 00:04:04,662
AND ALSO VERIFIABLE.

132
00:04:04,662 --> 00:04:06,164
IF THEY START TO COMMIT FOR

133
00:04:06,164 --> 00:04:07,365
IDENTIFICATION AND LOCATION AND

134
00:04:07,365 --> 00:04:09,600
THEN THE NEXT QUESTION I'M SURE

135
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:11,836
SECRETARY POMPEO PUT ON THE

136
00:04:11,836 --> 00:04:13,671
TABLE IS WE NEED TO VERIFY IT.

137
00:04:13,671 --> 00:04:14,839
WE WANT U.S. INSPECTORS

138
00:04:14,839 --> 00:04:15,673
INVOLVED.

139
00:04:15,673 --> 00:04:17,675
WE'RE WILLING TO HAVE OTHER

140
00:04:17,675 --> 00:04:18,276
INDEPENDENT INSPECTORS.

141
00:04:18,276 --> 00:04:20,111
WERE NOT GOING TO TURN INTO THE

142
00:04:20,111 --> 00:04:24,082
IAEA AS HAS BEEN DOWN IN THE

143
00:04:24,082 --> 00:04:24,415
PAST.

144
00:04:24,415 --> 00:04:25,817
THEY HAVE MADE FALSE CLAIMS.

145
00:04:25,817 --> 00:04:28,252
THAT'S ANOTHER ISSUE THAT HAS TO

146
00:04:28,252 --> 00:04:31,823
DROP.

147
00:04:31,823 --> 00:04:33,825
>> Shannon: WE KNOW THEY HAVE

148
00:04:33,825 --> 00:04:38,830
HAD MANY OTHER AGREEMENTS OVER

149
00:04:38,830 --> 00:04:39,497
NUMEROUS ADMINISTRATIONS AND

150
00:04:39,497 --> 00:04:43,101
THEY'VE ENDED WITH A MISSILE

151
00:04:43,101 --> 00:04:44,235
TEST OR SOME OTHER TEST

152
00:04:44,235 --> 00:04:45,336
NORTH KOREA HAD AGREED THEY

153
00:04:45,336 --> 00:04:46,471
WEREN'T GOING TO DO.

154
00:04:46,471 --> 00:04:49,340
WE KNOW IT'S A DETAILED, TEDIOUS

155
00:04:49,340 --> 00:04:49,874
PROCESS.

156
00:04:49,874 --> 00:04:52,243
THIS ADMINISTRATION AND

157
00:04:52,243 --> 00:04:53,778
PRESIDENT TRUMP PROBABLY WANTING

158
00:04:53,778 --> 00:04:54,679
A MORE EXPEDITED TIMETABLE ON

159
00:04:54,679 --> 00:04:56,647
THE DENUCLEARIZATION THAT WHAT

160
00:04:56,647 --> 00:04:57,682
KIM JONG UN WOULD AGREE TO.

161
00:04:57,682 --> 00:00:00,000
WE'LL HAVE TO SEE HOW THEY
