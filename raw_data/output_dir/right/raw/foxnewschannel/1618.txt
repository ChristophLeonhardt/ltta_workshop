1
00:00:10,379 --> 00:00:11,047
>> Tucker: LIKE PRISONERS

2
00:00:11,047 --> 00:00:11,881
PUTTING CHECKS ON A CONCRETE

3
00:00:11,881 --> 00:00:13,316
WALL, WE LIKE TO MARK THE

4
00:00:13,316 --> 00:00:14,951
PASSAGE OF TIME ON THE SHOW.

5
00:00:14,951 --> 00:00:18,487
AS OF TODAY, ROBERT MUELLER'S

6
00:00:18,487 --> 00:00:20,289
INVESTIGATION TO RUSSIA HAS BEEN

7
00:00:20,289 --> 00:00:22,024
RUNNING FOR AN ENTIRE YEAR.

8
00:00:22,024 --> 00:00:27,897
WHAT HAVE WE LEARNED?

9
00:00:27,897 --> 00:00:29,332
JOE DEGENEVA JOINS US WITH A

10
00:00:29,332 --> 00:00:30,700
RECAP.

11
00:00:30,700 --> 00:00:32,101
JOE, WHAT DO WE KNOW?

12
00:00:32,101 --> 00:00:34,904
>> WE KNOW THAT HILLARY CLINTON

13
00:00:34,904 --> 00:00:36,305
WAS ILLEGALLY EXONERATED, WE

14
00:00:36,305 --> 00:00:37,106
KNEW THAT ONE YEAR AGO.

15
00:00:37,106 --> 00:00:40,109
WE KNEW THERE WAS A SUBSTANTIAL

16
00:00:40,109 --> 00:00:40,776
EFFORT TO FRAME THE CURRENT

17
00:00:40,776 --> 00:00:41,811
PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES

18
00:00:41,811 --> 00:00:44,580
WITH CRIMES BY INFILTRATING HIS

19
00:00:44,580 --> 00:00:46,582
CAMPAIGN, AND THEN HIS

20
00:00:46,582 --> 00:00:50,386
ADMINISTRATION WITH SPIES THAT

21
00:00:50,386 --> 00:00:51,721
THE FBI HAD SET UP ON THEM.

22
00:00:51,721 --> 00:00:53,856
WE LEARNED THAT THE CRIMES WERE

23
00:00:53,856 --> 00:00:55,491
COMMITTED BY THE FBI, SENIOR

24
00:00:55,491 --> 00:00:57,893
MEMBERS OF THE DEPARTMENT OF

25
00:00:57,893 --> 00:01:01,263
JUSTICE, MR. CLAPPER, MR. COMEY,

26
00:01:01,263 --> 00:01:02,932
AND OTHERS ASSOCIATED WITH THE

27
00:01:02,932 --> 00:01:06,302
DEMOCRATIC PARTY.

28
00:01:06,302 --> 00:01:08,070
DONALD TRUMP AND HIS ASSOCIATES

29
00:01:08,070 --> 00:01:09,005
COMMITTED NO CRIMES.

30
00:01:09,005 --> 00:01:10,139
>> Tucker: THAT'S QUITE A

31
00:01:10,139 --> 00:01:11,107
LITANY.

32
00:01:11,107 --> 00:01:12,708
SO TO THE SPYING QUESTION, THE

33
00:01:12,708 --> 00:01:13,909
PRESIDENT TWEETED THAT MORNING,

34
00:01:13,909 --> 00:01:16,579
I WILL NEVER FORGET IT, THEY

35
00:01:16,579 --> 00:01:18,114
SPIED ON US FROM TRUMP TOWER.

36
00:01:18,114 --> 00:01:20,683
I DON'T THINK THERE WAS A SINGLE

37
00:01:20,683 --> 00:01:22,885
PERSON THAT DIDN'T THINK, THAT'S

38
00:01:22,885 --> 00:01:26,088
A HEAVY DUTY CHARGE, CAN YOU

39
00:01:26,088 --> 00:01:26,489
PROVE IT?

40
00:01:26,489 --> 00:01:30,593
THAT HAS IN EFFECT BEEN APPROVED

41
00:01:30,593 --> 00:01:31,360
THAT HAS IN EFFECT BEEN APPROVE

42
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:31,727
APPROVED.

43
00:01:31,727 --> 00:01:32,261
>> JOE: ABSOLUTELY.

44
00:01:32,261 --> 00:01:33,562
THE FBI PROVE THAT IN ALL

45
00:01:33,562 --> 00:01:36,265
GUIDELINES AND ALL ESCALATION,

46
00:01:36,265 --> 00:01:37,900
AND I BELIEVE THEY COMMITTED

47
00:01:37,900 --> 00:01:41,037
CRIMES IN DOING SO, PURPOSELY

48
00:01:41,037 --> 00:01:42,872
SENT PEOPLE INTO THE TRUMP

49
00:01:42,872 --> 00:01:44,707
CAMPAIGN TO PLANT FALSE

50
00:01:44,707 --> 00:01:45,508
INFORMATION, THEN FORCE THAT

51
00:01:45,508 --> 00:01:46,342
INFORMATION TO BE FORWARDED BACK

52
00:01:46,342 --> 00:01:48,077
TO THE CIA AND FUNNELED TO THE

53
00:01:48,077 --> 00:01:51,247
FBI TO BE USED AS FALSE

54
00:01:51,247 --> 00:01:53,282
INFORMATION IN PFIZER

55
00:01:53,282 --> 00:01:54,884
APPLICATIONS.

56
00:01:54,884 --> 00:01:57,486
EVERYONE INVOLVED IN THAT

57
00:01:57,486 --> 00:01:58,054
PROCESS WHO KNOWINGLY

58
00:01:58,054 --> 00:01:58,888
PARTICIPATED COMMITTED A CRIME.

59
00:01:58,888 --> 00:02:01,490
>> Tucker: SO WHY ARE THEY NOT

60
00:02:01,490 --> 00:02:02,758
BEING HELD TO ACCOUNT?

61
00:02:02,758 --> 00:02:04,026
>> JOE: AS OF TODAY I BELIEVE

62
00:02:04,026 --> 00:02:06,796
THAT A REFERRAL FOR PROSECUTION

63
00:02:06,796 --> 00:02:12,501
HAS BEEN MADE TO MR. HUBER WHO

64
00:02:12,501 --> 00:02:14,503
IS INVESTIGATING THE LEAKS, AND

65
00:02:14,503 --> 00:02:16,072
EVERYTHING THAT WE DESCRIBE

66
00:02:16,072 --> 00:02:16,706
TONIGHT.

67
00:02:16,706 --> 00:02:17,673
CRIMINAL REFERRALS HAVE ALREADY

68
00:02:17,673 --> 00:02:20,342
BEEN MADE AND I SUGGEST THAT

69
00:02:20,342 --> 00:02:21,911
MR. BRENNAN, WHO LOVES TO MAKE

70
00:02:21,911 --> 00:02:25,081
COMMENT ABOUT THE PROCESS GET

71
00:02:25,081 --> 00:02:27,983
HIMSELF A GOOD LAWYER, NOT A

72
00:02:27,983 --> 00:02:28,517
GOOD WRITER.

73
00:02:28,517 --> 00:02:31,487
>> Tucker: WAIT, JOHN BRENNAN,

74
00:02:31,487 --> 00:02:33,456
THE NBC NEWS PAID CONSULTANT?

75
00:02:33,456 --> 00:02:35,691
>> JOE: YES, THE FORMER

76
00:02:35,691 --> 00:02:37,727
DIRECTOR OF THE CENTRAL

77
00:02:37,727 --> 00:02:39,729
INTELLIGENCE 80 AND SEE, THE

78
00:02:39,729 --> 00:02:41,564
MOST PARTISAN HACK WHO NEEDS A

79
00:02:41,564 --> 00:02:43,566
VERY, VERY GOOD LAWYER.

80
00:02:43,566 --> 00:02:46,102
>> Tucker: A CRIMINAL LAWYER.

81
00:02:46,102 --> 00:02:47,103
>> JOE: YES.

82
00:02:47,103 --> 00:02:49,472
HE DOESN'T NEED A SLIP AND FALL

83
00:02:49,472 --> 00:02:50,573
LAWYER, ALTHOUGH HE MAY SLIP AND

84
00:02:50,573 --> 00:02:51,107
FALL.

85
00:02:51,107 --> 00:02:52,408
HE WILL BE IN FRONT OF A GRAND

86
00:02:52,408 --> 00:02:55,911
JURY SHORTLY.

87
00:02:55,911 --> 00:02:57,947
>> Tucker: WELL, THAT'S NEWS.

88
00:02:57,947 --> 00:03:00,716
>> JOE: YES, AND IT'S GOOD

89
00:03:00,716 --> 00:03:01,016
NEWS.

90
00:03:01,016 --> 00:03:01,617
>> Tucker: THERE'S NOT A

91
00:03:01,617 --> 00:03:02,985
SINGLE TIME THAT YOU HAVE COME

92
00:03:02,985 --> 00:00:00,000
ON THAT I DON'T FEEL BETTER AT
