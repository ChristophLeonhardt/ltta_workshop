point where everything that we know and understand about physics is no longer valid I think one of the reasons black holes are so enigmatic right is that in a way it's quite problematic even for astrophysicists and physicists to reconcile these sort of two different views so on the one hand a black hole is the sort of mathematical entity it's a solution to Einstein's equations of a point mass of a very compact dense mass that warps space-time very very dramatically almost to the point of a puncher and the black hole is defined as having a region and event horizon which is the point of no return even for light and that this region encases a singularity a point where all the laws known laws of physics actually break down and what we don't really have is a detailed quantum understanding of the structure of this really small scale thing so that you know it remains to be understood it's a it's an open problem that lots of people are working on and then there's the view of a black hole as the end product of the life cycle of a star so I think in a way right so that's an Astrophysical object it has mass it's the left over after the implosion of a big star and so in a way the enigmatic and sell these two views and these two views are problematic particularly because they in case the singularity the sort of point where everything that we know and understand about physics is no longer valid
