the evening
please
now let's take a closer look but the two
men involved in the main event of the
evening
khabib nurmagomedov vs Conor McGregor is
one of those fights where the moment it
gets announced you get goosebumps and
you go whoa here we go
the reason that this fight is so big and
the reason that people are so fired up
about this fight it's two of the best in
the world in their prime fighting when
they should be fighting this fight shows
you the type of man that Conor McGregor
is he said I want the toughest challenge
available I want the one that everybody
says I can't win and could be you have a
guy that is 26 and old
undefeated that's unreal at 26 wins guys
tend to make mistakes
kavita has never done that this is the
most intriguing stylistic matchups and
without a doubt the biggest fight in the
history of the lightweight division and
in my opinion the biggest fight in the
history of the UFC
he never fight with someone like me he's
getting bald
barbosa's face says it all they have so
much pressure so much room that minute
this is so funny
Michaelson tapper he's gonna break
guitar get a break guitar
this is my cell crush my promise he's
just an unprecedented phenom we're
talking bowling massacres
I wanna fight both your chicken because
this is number one is if I didn't like
the division we are ready here we are
ready for war we are ready for all
outcomes all situations all scenarios I
am in a war state of mind you're looking
at a fighting veteran I've been true at
all
I've been on the box inside nothing on
this side I came back for the love of
fighting in the love of war and this I
am going to truly truly love putting a
bad bad beating on this little glass jaw
rat my belt has been never had taken
from my way so they've gotta build a
piece these fake champions but gram
we're torn time to take back my song I
know he is afraid of a smack and if
you're afraid of a smack off me a smack
will feel like a double-barrel shotgun
what you're gonna do if you know nothing
now you have to you have to match well
first or second block what you're gonna
do I'm gonna keep going
if you don't like me out is gonna be
very long night trust me mate I'm ready
for a long night

stripped by the time this fight takes
place we'll see what happens I don't
give a wealth corner I think about on
the belt I don't care who's my opponent
