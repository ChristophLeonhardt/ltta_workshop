so there was a time not so very long ago when people like me and Steve Schmidt would have disagreed with Rosie O'Donnell on just about every policy question in the news but it was really likely understood years before we did Donald Trump's unique brand of xenophobia denigration of women and loose personal and business ethics can make for some unusual alliances as our politics realigned and the questions become starker and darker Democrats find themselves contemplating whether it's safe to build bridges to some of the very same Republicans they love to hate just years ago it also raises an important political question how do Democrats build a bigger tent and turn it out to vote for their candidates three weeks from today Steve Rosie and Eugene are still here how do they do that well I always thought why didn't they count to program his rallies there's not CS rallies why didn't the Democratic Commission get together and go when he's there we're gonna get Springsteen and have some speakers and the local politicians why is there he's allowed to go this to do this reality show mm-hmm and everyone just follows it it nobody says nobody you've worked in television and forever why didn't they do that well because I think the mainstream media didn't frame the rallies as they were nobody said that he paid for people to be there that there were only this many people he had to move inside the gym because the outs or venue was too big no one said the facts like even when the rallies are happening now I wish the news media would frame it for the people watching it here's another hate-filled rally full of lies by a president who wasn't really elected let me just fox doesn't even take the rallies anymore so I don't disagree on the problem as it was at the time but that's not the problem now how do Democrats win now yeah that is a scary thing coming up with 19 days left you know we have to get out the vote that's the only thing to do that if a tsunami happens and the people show up there like in Tiananmen Square all those years ago those inspirational photos of the woman in front of the tank we're that's where we're going out America unless we turn up at the polls Democrats win district by district state-by-state they have to they have to do that and candidates have to be appropriate for the district they have to speak to those voters and and however they can I mean and and hold you know political disagreements and I might have once had with with Steve or with you about about policies you know they're all held in abeyance at a time of national emergency percent of the country disapproves of Donald Trump and Democrats are wringing their hands like okay why not Democrats are bullish about their juice we don't have a real legal Joe Biden is not the leader who's the leader who's the one out there you know just just worry about your district worry about your state say you know talk to talk to people talk to voters see that's what you do you made as you main messages what should the Democratic message be for the next 19 days there's one question on the ballot dude does the country want to put a check on Donald Trump do we want to put a check on trumpism do we want to repudiate it or do we want to validate it because should the Republicans maintain majority control in the house should they maintain majority control in the Senate this president will not only be unchecked he will be emboldened and at the core what he's doing is stoking a cold civil war in this country between the American people he's the first president in the history of the country who makes no pretense about being the leader of the American people he is the leader he is the leader of a faction and he is dividing us and those divisions will take years and years and years to heal we are one people we are one people we are the American people and when you see a President of the United States doing what he is doing to this country not to mention it the unraveling of the us-led liberal global order that emerged from the horror and the catastrophe and out of the death camps in the ruin of a war that killed 80 million people his fidelity to democracy is nil because fidelity to small-l liberalism is not there and you see it with his complicity and it is complicity in the murder of a Washington Post columnist by a middle-eastern thug tell me why all that is true I think we all agree coming from different sides of the political spectrum why are Democrats today so anxious about the anxiety is what Democrats do and it's very fit and it's frustrating don't stop wringing your hands we've said and and and and find the 30-second version we'll figure it out for an ad for Bobby Kennedy is a is a great example of what the Democrats should be doing now if you look at his race is unfinished campaign in 1968 he wasn't trying to make an ideological place on a map right where between Nixon and Eugene McCarthy he was making an argument for better trying to lift up our politics who are the leaders out there that are arguing for better that or selling an aspiration that are saying to the American people that hey we can be better we can go to a better place this is what the future looks like our job and all of us connected through the generations on the backs of the generations of American patriots who sacrifice beggars the imagination we have an obligation we have an obligation to be trustees of a great inheritance to strengthen the country for future generations where is the bigness can you name me Pamela Harris I think Cory Booker I don't think Joe Biden at all I think Joe Biden is part of the old dynamic and the old paradigm and I think that's progressive new leaders like Stacey Abrams of governor and Georgia these are the people that are making you feel like we could maybe topple him he feels now indestructible since Kavanaugh you know the pressure level has been for women especially has been so immense we couldn't believe that he did that that he got him through to the Supreme Court it was shocking to me that he didn't even have him on the list until he wrote this by the way president should be held not be held accountable for their criminal actions then he put them on the list and got him all the way through in spite of everything that happened that was the terrifying moment of Trump for me people is better or or has that sort of dream sort of ya know but it's also Tim Ryan who is the congressman from Youngstown it's also Seth Moulton five combat tours as a Marine officer it's Dan McReady in the North Carolina 11th district it's the scores of women combat veterans that are running it's the whole spectrum of people who whether they may be very liberal and far more liberal than my tastes or more conservative than Rosie's taste but are faithful to the idea of the country that we are a people created equal by our Creator life liberty and the pursuit of happiness it is about the most perfect idea ever put to paper by the mind of man we've not only we've not always lived by it but the defense of it is essential and we see it son during every hour of every day which is vile administered doesn't even get what you said that's the problem he's like sitting there watching Fox right now and it doesn't understand even the basic concepts or the theories that you're presented just then hey there I'm Chris
