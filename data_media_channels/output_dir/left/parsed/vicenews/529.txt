yep get out my mom would not like that
at all
that's where
I was thinking recently how many songs
there are about waiting at home for the
phone to ring and how somebody listens
to a song like that now and has no idea
what they're talking about
I mean even a cash card yeah like it
seems
what's cash yeah the first verse could
have been about like fax machines or
like a phone booth it's David Byrne get
out of here Wow really late David Byrne
filter needs a tune-up the skeleton that
lasted I was a good line to end on
there's something that sounded like it
was made really quickly and I mean that
as a compliment
it just sounds like that's what she was
thinking at that second it's just like
let's just go do this right now I
enjoyed very much the monotone delivery
it seemed to be working with the beat
infirm in a way that I responded to it
was contagious promise but if you go -
Leigh you can let me get ready
that was awesome
I like the track that didn't really
change it just kept pushing forward the
singing was fantastic
is it from Atlanta it's from Scotland
get out of here head out Scotland South
Scotland tea okay that that's what
that's what I was picking up on I would
listen to the instrumental of that for
as long as it lasted
even though it's got kind of
old-fashioned genre aspects it didn't
feel remotely pastiche II or anything it
sounded really from the heart
I enjoyed the mixing quite a bit back up
singing louder than the lead vocal
thanks for a taya that's an awesome
touch very nice I like watching the
camera on me and then he's got nothing
let's go over here
you
