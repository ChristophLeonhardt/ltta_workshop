right from the get-go it seemed like they were struggling with message hi I'm Amy Parnes I'm the co-author of shattered inside Hillary Clinton's doomed campaign it's easy to say Russia and James call me were to blame we think that that was definitely a part of it but in reporting this book we unearthed a lot of various factors such as her lack of a message there was some squabbling inside between especially some key advisors also she encountered this likability problem and an image problem that kind of coincided with that we detail one part of the book focused on her Roosevelt Island speech in New York where she brought in a lot of different aides and advisors and it was hard for her to or hard for them to actually come up with one singular message America can't succeed unless you succeed as one person put it to us it was as if that speech could have been given by any Democrat and it wasn't specific to Hillary Clinton and I think that was the problem for her she had a wall in her Brooklyn headquarters that basically had post-it notes all over the place basically policy ideas and it said Hillary is four and all these various policy ideas were throughout or scattered all over the wall and someone actually told us you know if you're for everything in here for nothing ultimately she never really explained to people why she was running that was the problem but I think when you lose by under 80,000 votes total and you win by the popular vote huh I think anything is a factor and I think well James Comey and Russia were factors obviously her likability and her image problems and also this email controversy that kind of leaned over her campaign for for the entirety of the campaign even before she announced her candidacy she was having she was put on defense having to explain why she did that that was something that kind of loomed over her campaign throughout that summer where inside you had AIDS sort of fighting whether or not to get out in front of it and some people some advisors thought that she should come out and apologize for it and other people even her husband she and her husband felt like they did nothing wrong and so they didn't want to they didn't feel the need to apologize so you had that kind of internal dynamic playing out it ultimately took her six months to actually say I'm sorry and a few tries on television to actually get to the point where she did that
