I would say almost every morning I thank
the Lord for being there for another day
to be healthy as I've been to be able to
do the things I've been able to do and
all that I I do think the Lord for that
but soon thereafter is my trainer shows
up at 6:30 in the morning and he has for
26 years now that's not right on
Saturday and Sundays if I'm in Dallas he
shows up at 8 o'clock but work days 6:30
and then I'm at the office at 8:00 so I
have a very rigid routine which I find
that I enjoy I like to know that I'm
gonna get up at 6:30 in the morning and
I'm gonna work out and at 8 o'clock I'm
going to the office so I'm programmed
sometimes you know people they don't
want to be programmed like that I like
to be programmed that way
you
