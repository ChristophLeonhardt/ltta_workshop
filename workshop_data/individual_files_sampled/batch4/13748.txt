on Thursday Politico announced that Huffington Post would be taking its readers on a voyage of discovery to strange Uncharted lands like Vasco de Gama venturing out into New Territories Huffington Post will be packing a few of its staffers onto a leaky bus and taking them on a cross-country seven week tour through the dark mysterious Middle America the cost 1 million dollars yes I am not joking this is the story quotes starting in September a traveling party rotating HuffPost staff members led by editor-in-chief lydia full grade will visit more than 20 cities issuing the coasts for the likes of Fort Worth Indiana Oxford Mississippi and Odessa Texas at each city the site will host events roll out plans stories of local media outlets send out reporters to write about the communities and collect stories from residents in their own words this would be identity defining for HuffPost said Poole green in an interview we are in a moment for determining our own identity and the role we play in the overall news ecosystem and what the next iteration of that looks like and this felt like a great way to go out and report out the story of who we should be in the world don't worry gang the leftist media isn't out of touch or anything this does show that so-called flyover country is new to the media their disconnect with people who live in Texas and Oklahoma and Alabama and Michigan and Wisconsin it's quite real they don't understand their values they don't understand their lifestyles this is why CNN - Erin Burnett mocks Christian pasture pastors for laying hands on president Trump they did the same for Obama but nobody cared and why the entire media was shocked that anybody would vote for Trump in the first place but it weren't just suffice to visit these places until the media begins hiring in these areas they won't have boots on the ground or perspective into the places they seek to cover jet-setting - Rose essa isn't exactly going to provide sort of empathetic analysis the less lacks about people outside of New York in LA and so the Huffington Post Tour is much more likely to be a sort of Jeff Corwin experience for city folk than a real educational experience look bill what is that lady doing going into that building with the cross on top it's a Sunday doesn't she know it's time for brunch at the local coffee house I mean they serve avocado toast and the

in the latest hubbub but there's an article that I think it is necessary to go through because it really struck me this is why the Left loses so the left thinks that if they hit Trump enough on Russia that the and people will just swivel around and hate Trump it and what they fail to acknowledge is the reason that people like Trump is because they hate the left the reason that Trump is almost completely a reactionary phenomenon it is the stupidity and the out of touch nests of left that has led to the rise of President Trump and these Republican rubes that the left so despises is why Trump was really the apex of this I mean the fact is that Barack Obama lost a thousand seats across the country in state legislatures he lost twelve governor's he lost ten senators and Barack Obama devastated his party because the left took off its mask in the last eight years and when people saw underneath was worse than Phantom of the Opera and so you can see this day in and day out when the left sort of reveals itself so today's example of this it actually comes from Monday there's a column by woman named Colleen Krajewski this was actually a column at The Washington Post and the title of it was I used to be quiet about the fact that I perform abortions now I'm upfront okay but the article is even crazier than this and this is the left bragging about what they do right like when I brag about things that I do in daily life you know if I'm going to brag about it I'll tend to brag about like career achievements or maybe I'll brag about something nice that I did in terms of giving charity maybe I'll brag about you know the good things I do with my wife and kids I don't typically associate I killed somebody else's baby as as something you brag about but not the same I guess if you are elected so here is what Colleen and krajewski right and again in the Washington Post on Monday with one of the nation's premier newspapers right quote one month after Donald Trump was elected president I leaned back in a black leather chair as a man hovered over me for the first time in decades the fate of roe v wade seemed to be in real doubt feeling a mix of anxiety sadness and resolved I thought I'm committed now what she's getting an abortion no she was getting a tattoo the tattoo artist slowly etched on my right forearm a rather large coat hanger the symbol of illegal abortions that cost unknown numbers of women their lives in the years before Roe overlaid in bold lettering rewards never again now as one of the udin let me say I do not like the appropriation of the phrase never again to apply to regulations against the killing of unborn human beings and this is sort of like the it would be sort of like if the Nazis posted a picture of a hook-nosed Jew and then said never again you're sort of missing the point of never again if never again which is a phrase used for the holic is now used to refer to never again we will be stopped from killing babies in the seventh month really she continues from now on unless I was in long sleeves everyone I met would see my tattoo the moment we shook hands at the office at parties in the supermarket on first dates now normally would say this person is a crazy person like this is not a great idea I'm a Republican I'm a conservative but I don't actually tattoo that on my arm like I don't have a picture of Ronald Reagan tattooed on my arm because that would be weird gang but she actually went and she got a picture of a hanger a coat hanger with the words never again tattooed on there again it could be slightly vague I mean maybe maybe never again means don't kill babies but apparently it's not it's virtually signalling for her leftist friends but that's not the worst part of this that you got this stupid tattoo my best my favorite part of this article is that she goes on to talk about how abortion her being an abortionist has now enhanced her dating life seriously it's what this article is about how her abortion has enhanced her dating life thanks to President Trump she says embracing the symbol of the coat hanger meant also accepting myself as a symbol symbol which I had always resisted but as I shed stigma of being an abortion provider I felt free I was tired of playing games and for the first time in my life I was ready for someone to love me because I provide abortions not in spite of it okay with that tattoo I made some other changes no more padding my eyelashes on dates feigning innocence or acting apologetic about Who I am no more waiting the requisite three days to call back or count me on three dates to have sex if I wanted to she goes on and she says an unexpected side effect of the 2016 election is that many people have become vocal about their support for reproductive rights suddenly dating an abortion provider can be cool a way to proclaim one's liberal street cred yeah I'm sure that's what guys were thinking I'm sure they're dating this girl may go you know what she's so awesome she kills babies mmm yeah bring this one home to mother and she's awesome she third trimester second she didn't care she'll do it I mean okay let me just make a quick point I have a feeling she she links her own abortion tattoo to the fact that you will have sex before three dates I have a feeling that some of the people she is dating might have the same idea and these two things in fact maybe that's what guys are thinking not oh it's so awesome I'm dating a woman with an abortion tattoo but I'm dating a woman with an abortion catch and maybe that means that she will be a little bit easier to to get where I want her to go I saw this by the way at the 2012 DNC I went to the Democratic National Convention in 2012 and there was a there were guys who are wearing around pins that said I love pro-choice girls and I thought to myself yeah I can see that yeah that is not a shock so I met investment banker who was close to a decade younger than I am for him my profession seemed to add to the edginess of dating an older woman I was insecure this lady is and she's writing a personal to ad in the Washington telex remember this isn't that the salon is not it's late it's in the Washington Post right democracy dies in darkness Washington Post like Woodward and Bernstein Washington Post for him my profession seems to seem to add to the edginess of dating an older woman there was the hard-partying Alaskan fishermen on an extended shore break who found my commitment to reproductive justice hot I'm going to go with the Alaskan fisherman on the extended shore break did not find your commitment to reproductive justice hot he wanted to get in your pants and so he told you that lady and she says so abortion providers are hot now as time goes on I sometimes forget about the tattoo entirely once I wore long sleeves before becoming intimate with a fascinating biomedical engineer and when he first saw the tattoo he burst out laughing apparently delighted by my commitment to the cause well maybe that was your read obviously she's ended up in a long-term relationship she's gotten everything that she wants out of life I love that this is like Carrie Bradshaw talking about being an abortion provider it's just amazing says neither the tattoo know my perspective changed everything there's the entrepreneur with political aspirations who sent mixed signals and ultimately drifted away you mean unlike the Alaskan fisherman on shore leave from the porno you watch three days ago this was because I could be a liability to him in some future election or was he just not over his ex being more open about what I do has not led to perfect communication or the end of insecurity how she concludes this column is the whole thing further says recently and I have to say I love the scallop I think it's the greatest column that was ever written I think this ranks up there with like Cicero and with Plato I mean this is just fantastic so recently an online dating match messaged me and without knowing my specialty began lamenting the threat of sp3 he's an attorney temporarily based in North Dakota where he's defending standing rock protesters of course he is our conversation about social justice led to such a strong connection that we meeting despite the distance wow that that Wow what a love story he defends standing rock protesters and you kill babies what just a match made in heaven because whatever happens I will no longer be silent or beautiful when a new love interest or anyone makes me feel exposed and vulnerable as my tattoo says never again okay so now she has applied never again to killing babies and also telling guys who she wants to have sex with that she does that for a living again please do not hijack Holocaust phrases to justify your crappy dating life late but this is what you wonder why Trump wins this lady's just 100,000 votes for Trump in Wisconsin I think Donald Trump should actually have copies of this column printed out and handed out to everyone in the Midwest well done Washington Post so this is why Trump isn't losing support okay Trump can't lose support because a lot of the people who support Trump are not going to move over to the side of Killeen krajewski or whatever her name is they're nothing to move over to that they're going to look at this and go I don't want to be associated in any way with these crazy people and if Trump talks to some Russians whatever at least he doesn't have an abortion tattoo and then talk about his dating life like really it is amazing stuff from the left so well done leftist he's done a wonderful job alienating every person of decent mind and heart in America please continue to do so as fast as possible okay meanwhile there's more fallout from the Donald Trump jr. Fredo Corleone spilling of the emails yesterday as you recall Donald Trump jr. a couple of days ago he spilled emails that showed that he was approached by some nutty British promoter and that nutty British promoter is is also the agent for a guy that Trump did business with in Russia and he said the Russian government really wants to help out your father he says it's Donald Trump jr. and so what we want you to meet with the Russian government lawyer who has some dirt on Hillary Clinton and Trump yours like yeah that was awesome and and so you know first of all CNN uncovered footage of Trump with Russians and I do love the media bias here because it pretty is it is pretty stunning CNN uncovered this media I was watching CNN because it was on at the gym and there's nothing I could do about it and CNN was playing this footage over and over and over again like it was some sort of smoking gun this is from I think 2013 2014 long before Trump was running for president the behind-the-scenes video obtained exclusively by CNN shows then businessman Donald Trump in Las Vegas in 2013 at several events during the weekend of the Miss USA pageant hanging out with the men now at the center of the newest development in the Russia controversy the men Russian pop singer Amin Aguilera and his father Iraq the real estate developer in Russia we're helping Trump sold his Miss Universe pageant in Moscow later that year and the videos from the scene having dinner with the aguillera along with their publicist Rob Goldstone being here leaning over to talk with Trump right there's a boy Raja I known and that's a les grossman from as I say from Tropic Thunder and and then CNN think oh we got him now we have tape okay first of all we knew the trunk with all these people why is this a shock in any way oh he had dinner okay well Barack Obama used to like hang out with Bill Ayers and the in CNN spent years pretending that didn't matter so why in the world would it matter that Trump knew these people of course from knew these people how do you think they had Trump Jr's email address it's just silly okay so Trump respond the Trump team responds and as always they respond in perhaps the dumbest possible way so Kellyanne Conway leads the way and I understand that everything is so polarized right now that Kellyanne Conway could basically go on Fox News and do some arm parting and everybody would just say that it was brilliant an interim plan and she could do that and then she could do this a couple of times and all of CNN would claim that this was in fact secret Morse code to the Russians that we need more of their help in the next election cycle they arm farting is policy but here's Kellyanne Conway doing what like this is not real life folks this cannot be real life here she was with Sean Hannity this this actually happened this was the thing this is how you see it so far this is to help all the people at home what's the conclusion collusion no we don't have that yet I see illusion and delusion Brooke books are just over clear everyone forwards conclusion collusion no illusion delusion yes I just thought we'd have some fun with words so Sesame's Grover where is a day for Shaan SS Menzel over New York Post and I think that the Trump administration has had enough fun with words for one week but this is it first of all confusion okay how about that one confusion how about some some decency exclusion they this is all insane the profusion ah it's giving me a contusion this is the hope it's just ridiculous first of all I do love the fact that when she does this and she's holding it up like she had to physically cross out collusion didn't actually just make a collusion with a strikethrough through which is available on her word right they actually had to have her physically strike it out and then cross it out like how dumb does she think voters are I mean I guess pretty dumb like you actually have to show up it's a collusion conclusion illusion delusion exclusion profusion contusion McPherson nuclear fusion okay alright okay like how about natural defense here's the defense okay Donald Trump jr. allegedly tried to collude with the Russians to do bad stuff nothing came of it so his attempted collusion FS it shows motive but it doesn't show means or opportunity as I've been saying for two straight days now and media have been trying to say this was the beginning of a nefarious collusion again one of the things that I don't understand is what exactly would that collusion constitute okay let's actually say for a second that Donald Trump jr. had somehow gotten together with the Russians what would that constitute remember the Trump administration the Trump campaign did not drop any new material about her about Hillary Clinton they drop anything right so I guess the collusion would have been something like WikiLeaks and the Russians go to trump and they say in two days we're dropping a new stash of emails but that's not how it worked I mean if anyone actually thinks back to the campaign this is not how it work so unless Trump was providing the Russians with material to go out and spill or unless the Russians were providing Trump with heads up that's not how it worked because as I recall now is there the entire election cycle and so are you as I recall there'd be a dump of WikiLeaks and WikiLeaks was obviously dumping because they didn't like Hillary Clinton that doesn't mean that Trump was behind it and then there'd be people like me who would sift through the WikiLeaks I mean thousands of pages of WikiLeaks trying to find the most damning portions and this is this is exactly what happened during the election cycle so to pretend like I'm still confused as to what collusion would actually look like all of these would be good defensive points going on TV and rhyming like Grover from Sesame Street on Sean Hannity show is not an actually good defense turns out it's not a great David but none of this matters I mean none of it matters because people are stuck in their lanes so Trump goes on with Pat Robertson yesterday providing certainly a contrast in visuals and and he says that the weird thing about all of this is like everybody keeps saying that Putin wanted me but Putin would rather have had Hillary as an example if Hillary had won our military would be decimated our energy would be much more expensive that's what Putin doesn't like about me and that's why I say why would he want me because from day one I wanted a strong military he doesn't want to say that we're going to be self-supporting we just about are now we're going to be exporting energy he doesn't want that he would like Hillary what she wants to have windmills you know he would much rather have that because energy prices will go up and Russia as you know relies very much on energy there are many things that I do that are the exact opposite of what he would want so when I keep hearing about that he would have rather had Trump I think probably mad because when I want a strong military you know she wouldn't have spent the money on the military but when I want a strong military when I want tremendous energy we're opening up coal we're opening up natural gas we're opening up fracking all the things that he would hate but nobody ever mentions him okay so it what Trump is saying here is actually right which is that Trump's policies have not been particularly pro-russia I mean aside from some sanctions talk there really is bit like Trump's again Trump's white house is very weird Trump says stuff and then his administration does stuff and the stuff that he says and the stuff that his administration does are two separate things so his administration is pursuing some pretty vehement anti-russian measures on certain things Trump himself will say very warm things toward Russia I don't buy his argument that Russia wanted Hillary and not Trump in the last election cycle because there's not a lot of evidence to that effect and in fact that email from Rob Goldstone specifically said the Russian government wants to help you and your campaign and Russia has been very warm toward Trump for years I mean predating this election cycle but he is correct to say you know when you say that I'm in collusion with Russia so where's the pro quo if you're saying there was some sort of quid like they did me a favor where's the pro quo what am i doing for them to favor and the answer is not much aside from some of the terms rhetoric like this is an actual fair point okay well with all of that said you know I do want to get to other things that Trump is doing and I want to get to the Democrats of course doing what they do best which is making everyone hate them we'll get to all of that in just a second but first I want to say thank you to our sponsors over at Birch gold so right now live uncertainty in the world after the Trump jr. emails broke the Dow Jones dropped like 100

precious metals birchgold.com slash Ben check that out okay so naturally the Democrats are completely incapable of stopping themselves and it's funny there's a little bit of a battle that's breaking out among the Democrats there are Democrats who are positioning for a presidential run in 2020 who are trying to say let's not talk about Russia and then you've got the people in Congress who are saying let's talk about Russia non-stop the reason is because of immediacy that's the actual gap they don't disagree with one another so Brad Sherman yesterday who is my Congress person yes really California you suck so much you suck Congress cut California anyway so Brad Sherman he actually made a proposal that sure that Trump should be impeached and he introduced a bill on the floor of the house a bill of impeachment against Trump on the floor of the house yeah good luck with that why are you doing this he's not he's of course he's not going to be impeached in this congressional term knowing what we know now so what would be the point of doing this well it can have either of two effects the hope is that it triggers an investigation an intervention in the white house and this is a faint hope that his staff is finally able to say now it's real articles and for that and for so many other reasons mr. president you've got to stop announcing reversals and foreign policy at 4:00 in the morning and 140 characters you've got to stop making foreign policy in complete ignorance of the facts which say your ear impeaching him so he'll stop tweeting my hope is that we end in competent impulsive government okay yeah good luck with that all this is of course is PR and the Democrats know then you have the ones who are running for president like Gavin Newsom he's going to run for governor in California and then he's going to run for president he says that we should all stop talking about Russia but he looks focus on the issues you can tell the difference between the guys running for the presidency and the guys who are running for Congress because Congress the Democrats think they're going to win Congress in 2018 on the Russia stuff Democrats know that in order to win the presidency they're going to have to do more than just talk about Russia so here's Gavin Newsom obviously the media is obsessed for good reason during the Russia story undoing prosecutors thank you well that's where I'm what originated how do you already explain to Democrats out there and your face how talking about Russian on the campaign trail is not going to lose it back and I don't know and more evidence you need I mean the end of the day at the end of the day even if you've gained this thing out you get rid of Trump right you're left with a guy who's you know who's out there talking about conversion therapy don't do anything right for the Democratic Party in our agenda so unless we deal with the issues of economic anxiety cultural issues in a substantive way and we get into how business and we actually demonstrate with some acuity and strength a clear conviction in terms of the fate and future of this country then we're never going to take that makes me think okay so gavin newsom obviously positioning himself for president is that going to work for him I don't think so Gavin Newsom is any other Democrat he just likes to say I phone a lot like really this is what this is his shtick I live in California lieutenant governor here he basically goes around and he says all the Democratic policies except on an iPhone and then ever goes moo' he's tech savvy and it's all stupidity okay so as we continue here on the bench I want to talk about what's going on with Trump care I want to talk about the new FBI nominee who had his hearings on the hill yesterday plus some

conservative podcast in the nation already to an actual substantive news away from Trump Russia Trump care is moving forward sort of so today Mitch McConnell has now revealed his bare-bones plan for the Senate bill it's difficult in the Senate because you've got conservatives like Ted Cruz and Mike Lee and Rand Paul on the one side and on the other side you have Susan Collins who basically would like to double down on Obamacare and so trying to cobble together 51 votes is sort of difficult Republicans can only lose two they can only lose two making moves to they can have 50 votes and Pence's a tiebreaker but if they lose three it's over it's not a lot of votes that you can afford to lose if you actually want to pass some sort of change to Obamacare so Trump is outside of course saying he wants Trump care pass now one of the problems here is that Trump has been absent from the campaign trail for three days he's now in France which is not going to Trump carroty good if he actually wanted to pass this thing it would be useful for him to maybe go out on the campaign trail and stump for and discuss the details and talk about why it's good but instead he sort of got these generic comments about why he wants Trump care passed but Trump doesn't know what the hell isn't it obviously number one repealing replace I am sitting in the Oval Office with a pen in hand waiting for our senators to give it to me now we have a president that's waiting to sign it I have pen in hand so now it means something will happen if they don't well I don't want to talk about it because I think would be very bad I will be very angry about it and a lot of people will be very upset but I'm sitting waiting for that bill to come to my desk I hope that they do it they've been promising it for years they've been promising it ever since Obamacare which is failed it's a failed experiment it is totally gone it's out of business and we have to get this done repeal and replace okay so he's just saying weldings now this is going to have no impact on Congress because the problem is you know that even if you pass something if it starts to go bad Trump isn't going to turn on you and blame you right he did this with the house they passed a bill and then he promptly turned around and crapped all over the bill by calling it mean mean mean so Trump doesn't have a lot of weight here so what does this new Obamacare replacement bill actually look like there are two there are several major problems with the Obamacare replacement bill in some ways it got better in some ways it actually got worse so they restored a bunch of the tat says that they'd cut in the original Senate bill in the bizarre hope that somehow this will lead Democrats to now think that they don't have to attack them for their slogan has been that they're cutting health care for poor people from Medicaid in order to subsidize tax cuts for the wealthy right this is the way that they left puts it so the Republicans cut a lot of the tax cuts for the wealthy but they left a couple they left some and that means the Democrats are going to say the exact same thing so you really have not won anything have you now they also have said Mitch McConnell is apparently encouraging people he's telling moderates to support the health care bill including the Medicaid cuts because quote they will never go into effect anyway okay so in other words the entire selling point the Paul Ryan selling point we're going to restructure Medicaid it doesn't even apply according to Mitch McConnell so basically they're lying to all of you and Mitch McConnell is telling the moderates they're lying to all of you so even the main thrust of the bill which was to cut Medicaid expansion it's not even cutting Medicaid it's cutting Medicaid expansion in the future even the main thrust of it McConnell saying is never going to go into place which means that you're basically keeping Obamacare in place the other major provision that changes is Ted Cruz and Michael Lee had proposed an amendment the amendment would have said that if you are in an Obamacare state and has an Obamacare exchange you are still subject to Obamacare regulations on pre-existing conditions and and essential benefits services and all the like but if you offer one of those plans in the health care exchange then you can offer other plans outside the health care exchange so the reason that matters is because if it's inside the health care exchange it still has to provide certain benefits it has to be subsidized by the government you're grouped together with other people in terms of Community Rating so the way that go cruising lis we're thinking about it was okay here's what we should do we'll still have the Obamacare pool though those will be basically high-risk pools and we'll subsidize them and we'll toss money into it and then all the healthy people they can opt out and buy cheaper insurance so everyone will get insurance the people who are unhealthy will get subsidized by the government to be in the Obamacare exchange the people who are healthy will go back to having a free-market system where they don't have to buy insurance then want to buy Meccano comes back with a version of this but the version of it that he proposes doesn't make any sense instead of separating out these other plans these low-cost plans it throws them into the obamacare exchange as well which means they're still subject to the Obamacare regulations and it means that the rates on those low cost plans are actually can go up because they're all in the pool together that means they're going to have to pay for the unhealthy people so you end up back with Obamacare so basically it's back to Obamacare again Rand Paul rightly so is excoriating the bill even yesterday he was as a piece over at Breitbart where he says I missed the old days when Republicans stood for repealing Obamacare so now too many Republicans are falling all over themselves to stuff hundreds of billions of taxpayer dollars into a bill that doesn't repeal Obamacare and feeds big insurance a huge bailout right this is all the subsidies for these high-risk pools because Obamacare regulations still here taxes many still in place totaling hundreds of billions of dollars insurance company bailouts those to remember when Republicans complain about Obama cares risk corridors remember when we called corridors nothing more than insurance company bailouts I remember when one prominent GOP candidate during the presidential debate explicitly called out Obamacare risk corridors as a bailout to insurance companies does anyone else now the GOP plan being put out forward is full of chalk is chock full of insurance bailout money to the tune of nearly 200 billion dollars Republicans present company excluded now support the idea of lowering your insurance premium by giving a subsidy to the insurance company if the GOP now supports an insurance Stabilization Fund to lower insurance prices maybe they should support a new car Stabilization Fund to lower the price of cars or maybe the GOP would support an i-phone Stabilization Fund to lower the price of phones the possibilities are limitless Rand Paul is right here listen this was always a foregone conclusion as soon as they said repeal and replace and as soon as it was clear that Donald Trump was never going to stand for a straight repeal it was pretty obvious that this was moving in the wrong direction it's not a it is just not a it's still not a useful bill it's so many useful bill they're going to do their best to try and pass off this craft and which is something good as an advance but as we say even the parts that advance even the parts that I supported of this bill like the Medicaid the Medicaid cutbacks even those restructuring even those are now being cut according to McConnell it's all just in name only to get something through so well done Republicans once again you have somehow you know somehow achieved failure out of what could have been victory what is it a curry is on the hill President Obama President Obama president thank God not president Trump has an FBI director nominee named Christopher ray Christopher ray was questioned on the hill yesterday and he was basically asked by Congress are you going to be independent the President of the United States you can be a lackey and here's what he had to say about being like Oh Megan coming do you see the press conference they gave about the Hillary Clinton investigation in July of last year I not live but yes would you have done that well senator there is an inspector general investigation in a director come on I'm talking about the investigation I'm asking about you would you have done that I can tell you that in my experience as a prosecutor and as head of the Criminal Division I understand their did would be department policies that govern public comments charged individuals I think those policies are there for reasons I thought left for them and I would follow those policy okay he talked about somebody that was never charged in this bearing fashion do you agree with that that's the way I understood he also agreed that he took over the prosecutors job by saying there's no case here well senator again there's an inspector general investigation in Connor would you you would not have done either one of those is what you're telling this committee at least I hope that's what you're telling us kidding I can't imagine a situation where an FBI director I would be giving a press conference on an uncharged individual much less talk Thank You Hale about it okay so you know this is of course the correct answer that he's not gonna be like James Comey and then he was also asked about Bob Muller because President Trump had suggested that the special prosecutor special counsel that he's on a witch-hunt against the Trump family and here was a raise response you say that Muller is a good guy all right that's been my experience yes and you will do anything necessary to protect him from being interfered with when it comes to doing his job absolutely I think he's would you believe that in light of the Don jr. email and other allegations that this whole thing about Trump campaign and rushes of witch-hunt is that a fair description of what we're all dealing with in America well senator I can't speak to the basis for those comments I can tell you that my experience with direct I'm asking you as the future FBI director you consider this endeavor a witch hunt I did not consider director Muller to be on a witch hunt okay so that is the correct answer rate will be confirmed you should be from a bunch of Democrats trying to hold them up just because they're angry at Trump and they want to talk about Russia a lot but Rey will be confirmed he is a good pick by President Trump the question is will Trump allow him to do his job or will Trump interfere and get angry at him the way he has if Bob Muller or Reince Priebus or Steve Bannon or Jared Kushner or every single other person he's ever appointed to his in the description so we'll find out but Christopher Rae will be a fine pick for FBI he did a good job in his hearings yesterday okay so I want to get some things I like things I hate in Big Idea before I do that I want to say thank you to

okay time for some things that I like and some things that I hate so things that I like we've been doing movies about sons who have disappointed their fathers this week we've been doing all sorts of material on that weighted East of Eden we've done a bunch of a bunch of different that we did Arrested Development we did Pete Rose today it's in the name of the Father so one of the great tragedies of this year that has yet to be remark upon is Nancy Lewis says that he's retiring from acting which is just horrifying he hath I mean Malthus says that he is lying we can only hope that Malthus is correct because Daniel day-lewis is the greatest living actor he is just phenomenal in every part that he has ever played his versatility is ridiculous the only other person I think was even in his league at this point might be Christian Bale but it see but even there I think that it's it's you know eight plus versus a daniel day was just phenomenal and everything one of his earliest films I think he won an Oscar for this was in the no did he wouldn't Oscar for this he wanted from my left foot I'm not sure if he won from the name of the father but the movie in the name of the father is a is a really good film great acting it's about the Guildford four this is a group of people who are convicted of terrorism they apparently confessed under duress they were convicted of terrorism in an IRA bombing in the 1970s and and Daniel day-lewis plays one of the Guildford four and his father is arrested basically because he just gets dragged into this because his son is an arrow do well and the entire movie is about him trying to live up to his father's memories his father dies in prison great movie is it possible way to place his death I'm trying to remember who plays his father but great performance is all around here's a little bit of a preview it was a time of innocence no poverty no law just love what's recall you coming welcome one of the partners and Gretel friends above the jam here any prayer in the wake of the open pub bombing debt the government has responded with emergency legislation and increase police powers of search and arrest makes on you are in trouble calling each other even the murders of five people fill your mind so we have like the bonus Jimmy Doohan disperses mirth their arrest was only the beginning my name is Giuseppe corner eminence and answers result a remarkable journey all of the defendants fled but they were subjected to physical and mental abuse while under police custody we're never harmed in this entire film is basically about his relationship with his father because his father gets dragged into this and his father's an honorable man and he really isn't at the beginning of the film is about how he learns to live up to his father's standards in the name of the Father is the name of the film very very good movie okay other things that I like so Bernie Sanders says he wants to run again which is great I could not be more excited about this he's asked about will he run again in 2020 at the age of 1293 and they're already apparently raising money for pudding cups so here is Bernie Sanders talking about it are you leaving 2020 on the table are you taking it off the table no I'm not taking it off the table I just have not made any decision so I think it's watch too early that means that he's going to run I mean that he's going to run right it means whenever someone says I'm not taking it off the table that means that he's going to run or in Bernie Sanders case hobble so that'll be that'll be great I'm mostly excited about it so that I can continue to do my Bernie Sanders impression forever for years and years and I hope that long after he passes when he is 120 years old when he passes that they will his corpse around and he continues to run so I can continue to talk about vacation homes and pudding cups as he so richly deserves as a crazy socialist who has two vacation homes and a Towson pudding cups so that's exciting okay time for some things that I hate okay so I was I saw this video on Twitter this morning I couldn't really believe that it was real there's some group out there that is making the case that women should be paid more than men why because it costs more to be a woman than it costs to be a man because you have things like shoes you have to buy this is perhaps the worst commercial for closing the pay gap in the history of humanity and it's a pretty long list here here is this commercial and basically it says that women should break things and and stomp their feet and whine and cry until they get what they want that's basically this commercial is so well done feminists listen up they're still not equal pay for equal work in rain world and it seems most women are not even angry about it but we should be so let's set a new goal from now on equal pay is no longer enough because women this woman who is kicking a ball ahead has ever brought their pain our underwear is ridiculous in more senses it could be much justice to be a woman since women should receive it we get paid less than someone who tries body lotion to escape she doesn't need a new outfit for any occasion he doesn't even know that the shoes make the outfit or to join of choosing the right shoes with Israel guys it's not a parody is expressing yourself and what every stylish woman is expressing is that equal pain is not enough quickl pain is not enough again a woman throws her high-heeled shoe at a window and shatters the window and the woman jumped on the hood of the car and ruins the hood of the car and a woman takes the mug into her boss's face and a break mostly the weakest mug of all time by the way and then she just screaming at her boss and then it shows a high-heeled shoe and it says hashtags women need more bianco I don't know if Bianco is but that is legitimately the worst ad for female empowerment I have ever seen in my entire life because if the case is that you're going to whine about the cost of your underwear so I should pay you more and then you're going to break my crap because of it you are fired okay you do not going to raise you get fired assault hitting people with bugs bad things folks you don't get to do this women should be paid more because their underwear cost more then what the hell should I be paid more because my Jewish rituals cost more they do ok Passover super expensive should I get paid more because I'm a Jew would it absolute utter a Horus nonsense ok other things that I hate Linda Sarsour has now said that she is taking names gang she's taking it she says I just know that I'm taking those who have lied about me to defame my character I may be quiet now but not for long I am working be scared of Linda Sarsour okay I'm honestly more scared of Linda Sarsour as friends like you know razz me Oda like actual terrorists then I'm scared of Linda Sarsour I understand that the West likes to use law fair I've been the victim of this that was what happened with Kwok boy but the anti Islamophobia scam brigade is up and our lieutenant was very angry because people are pointing out things that she said and she doesn't like it when people point out things that she said so pretty pretty amazing so Linda Sarsour yeah okay fine she's like evil Santa Claus checking from making a list and checking it twice okay other things that I hate Riley Dennis is a prominent transgender person on Twitter and Riley Dennis is a he because he is a man is he is saying that his argument is a direct well quote my argument may be your preference for women with vaginas over women with penises is to some degree influenced by our sis sexist society as a Riley Dennis who is a man with a penis I believe I don't know about the surgical status Reilly Dennis I'm fairly certain on this and believes he is a woman he says that your desire not to have sex with a man because he's a man is because you are cisgender not because of things like science right he says it's because the reason the reason that you as a straight man only one have sex with women you know like actual women with vaginas and chromosomes and such the only reason you'd want to do that is because of sexism in society there's another reason it is called evolution okay it's called procreation like God made things this way nature for you don't have to be a theist to believe this nature may think that men who on aspects of women won't have sex with women who actually have the body parts that produce children because that is what nature desires pull insanity okay final thing so usually we do big ideas on Thursday I can do this in about a minute 30 so we'll do big ideas on we'll do big ideas here on venture pero sure this is where I think an idea that I think has been under discussed and we talk about it so that you know more about it so due process of law so there's been a lot of talk about whether from jr. broke the law this week as though Donald Trump jr. a collusion is a crime and I keep saying no collusion is not a crime you actually have to cite me the statute and people I'm not going that's a crime it's bad bad means it's a crime no bad does not mean it's a crime due process of law means there must be a law on the books that you have violated and now we take you to trial and then you get a lawyer and then we decide whether you are guilty or innocent that's what due process of law means it's under the Fifth Amendment and the Fourteenth Amendment now the left is so bizarre that they believe there should be no due process of law for people like Donald from jr. but they also believe in this concept this idiotic concepts called substantive due process substantive due process is a Supreme Court term that is self-contradictory process and substance are opposites okay it's like saying it's like saying red sky blue okay that's not how it works substantive due process doesn't make any sense but the concept is that if you pass a law I don't like you have violated my due process right that's not what you process means due process means that once the laws in place I now get a due process of law before it is enforced upon me but the West has been using substantive due process to cram down abortion and the so-called rights of privacy and same-sex marriage they say that any law against these things violates your due process rights no it does not violate your due process rights in fact the concept of substantive due process was actually coined by Justice xx in the infamous and horrific Dred Scott decision in which he actually said that an act of Congress which deprives a citizen of the United States of his liberty or property merely because he came himself or brought his property into a particular territory of the United States and who had committed no offense against the laws could hardly be dignified with the name of due process of laws what he said is that if you're say your slave escapes into the north and you go there and then you want to bring your slave back you should be allowed to bring your slave back because otherwise you are being deprived of your property without due process of law except for the fact that has nothing to do with anything okay that's not due process of law due process of law would mean there would have to be a trial to determine whether you get your slave back or not in this context but it doesn't mean that you get to automatically overthrow the law because your due process has been denied due process of law is very important substantive due process by contrast is a supreme court adjudicated evil that allows them to do whatever they want so I thought that it was worthwhile elucidating that concept okay we will be back here tomorrow it's a Thursday today correct so tomorrow is the long-awaited mailbag we're going to do the interview with Mark Levin today we'll be doing that tomorrow as well on the show so the great one will be joining us tomorrow to talk about his brand-new new number one New York Times best selling book and that will be awesome so be there or be square I'm Ben Shapiro this is the Ben Shapiro show
