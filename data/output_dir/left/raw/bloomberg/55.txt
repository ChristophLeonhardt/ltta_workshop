1
00:00:01,490 --> 00:00:03,079
Sometimes a nickname just

2
00:00:03,350 --> 00:00:04,100
sticks.

3
00:00:04,370 --> 00:00:06,230
The maverick maverick maverick

4
00:00:06,260 --> 00:00:08,270
maverick everyone knows is a
maverick.

5
00:00:08,300 --> 00:00:09,440
Here comes the maverick.

6
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:11,870
Despite being a lifelong
conservative

7
00:00:12,110 --> 00:00:13,729
Arizona Senator John McCain was

8
00:00:13,940 --> 00:00:16,040
never afraid to go against the
grain.

9
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:17,869
But he said he never considered

10
00:00:18,410 --> 00:00:19,310
himself a maverick.

11
00:00:19,430 --> 00:00:21,229
This is not a not a label he

12
00:00:21,380 --> 00:00:23,270
really embraced all the time

13
00:00:23,710 --> 00:00:24,500
not being a maverick.

14
00:00:25,730 --> 00:00:27,499
But I liked standing up for what

15
00:00:27,620 --> 00:00:28,100
I believe.

16
00:00:28,730 --> 00:00:29,990
This is how a war hero

17
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:31,819
and a career politician learned to

18
00:00:31,970 --> 00:00:33,530
march to the beat of his own drum.

19
00:00:33,740 --> 00:00:35,840
Much to the chagrin of his own party

20
00:00:41,560 --> 00:00:42,729
John McCain had a reputation

21
00:00:43,510 --> 00:00:44,979
as a bit of a bad boy

22
00:00:45,250 --> 00:00:46,959
and he wasn't always the best
student when

23
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:47,889
he was in the U.S.

24
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:50,050
Naval Academy in Annapolis

25
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:51,729
LOreal SEO covered McCain mostly

26
00:00:52,180 --> 00:00:52,930
in the 80s.

27
00:00:53,170 --> 00:00:55,180
McCain crashed a few planes

28
00:00:55,450 --> 00:00:57,099
and he graduated fifth from the
bottom

29
00:00:57,490 --> 00:00:58,300
of his class.

30
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:01,909
1967 was a very tough

31
00:01:02,210 --> 00:01:03,050
year for McCain.

32
00:01:03,710 --> 00:01:05,659
Within one month of active duty in
the Navy

33
00:01:05,900 --> 00:01:07,459
he suffered injuries from a massive
fire

34
00:01:07,880 --> 00:01:09,649
onboard the USS Forrestal in the

35
00:01:09,740 --> 00:01:10,640
Gulf of Tonkin.

36
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:12,799
134 sailors died

37
00:01:13,100 --> 00:01:13,790
in the tragedy

38
00:01:14,180 --> 00:01:16,070
and John only 30 at the time

39
00:01:16,220 --> 00:01:18,050
narrowly averted Death himself.

40
00:01:21,110 --> 00:01:22,819
Only three months later McCain was

41
00:01:22,940 --> 00:01:24,079
shot down over North Vietnam

42
00:01:24,650 --> 00:01:26,359
and taken prisoner in Hanoi where

43
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:28,670
he was held in solitary tortured

44
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:30,860
and beaten repeatedly for years.

45
00:01:31,460 --> 00:01:33,169
McCain's time as a prisoner of war
left

46
00:01:33,410 --> 00:01:34,969
him permanently disabled unable

47
00:01:35,390 --> 00:01:36,890
to lift his arms above his head.

48
00:01:39,290 --> 00:01:41,059
McCain returned to the U.S. a war

49
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:41,900
hero

50
00:01:42,260 --> 00:01:44,610
and he decided to get involved in
politics.

51
00:01:44,630 --> 00:01:45,229
He ran for the U.S.

52
00:01:45,530 --> 00:01:46,099
House in 1982

53
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:47,630
and won.

54
00:01:47,930 --> 00:01:49,579
In 1986 he ran for the U.S.

55
00:01:49,820 --> 00:01:51,530
Senate and won that seat as well.

56
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:53,599
But McCain's first term became
embroiled

57
00:01:54,050 --> 00:01:55,849
in what came to be known as the
Keating Five

58
00:01:56,180 --> 00:01:57,079
scandal where he

59
00:01:57,470 --> 00:01:59,269
and four the lawmakers were accused
of improperly

60
00:01:59,990 --> 00:02:02,540
intervening in a probe by federal
regulators

61
00:02:02,630 --> 00:02:03,949
to help. Charles Keating CEO

62
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:05,149
of Lincoln Savings

63
00:02:05,570 --> 00:02:06,710
and Loan Association.

64
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:08,480
After a slap on the wrist

65
00:02:08,508 --> 00:02:10,219
and a slightly tarnished reputation

66
00:02:10,370 --> 00:02:12,049
McCain bounced back by reaching
across

67
00:02:12,470 --> 00:02:14,630
the aisle on campaign finance reform

68
00:02:14,900 --> 00:02:16,490
with Democrat Russ Feingold.

69
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:17,989
He successfully sponsored a major

70
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:20,660
overhaul of the campaign finance
system.

71
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:22,339
Despite the objections of Republican

72
00:02:22,850 --> 00:02:23,390
leaders

73
00:02:25,430 --> 00:02:27,290
after serving over 10 years in
Congress

74
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:29,059
McCain decided to run for the top
job

75
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:29,930
himself.

76
00:02:32,900 --> 00:02:34,279
During the 2000 Republican
presidential

77
00:02:34,850 --> 00:02:36,650
primaries McCain took some

78
00:02:36,740 --> 00:02:38,419
unorthodox stances saying

79
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:40,399
some things that Republicans are
really never

80
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:42,590
supposed to say such as.

81
00:02:42,740 --> 00:02:44,269
I'm deeply concerned about a kind

82
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:46,760
of class warfare that's going on
right now.

83
00:02:47,210 --> 00:02:48,140
It's unfortunate.

84
00:02:48,210 --> 00:02:49,609
There's a growing gap between the
haves

85
00:02:49,940 --> 00:02:51,740
and have nots in America

86
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:54,350
and I'm not sure we need to give

87
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:56,269
two thirds of that tax

88
00:02:56,690 --> 00:02:58,459
cut of that money to the

89
00:02:58,550 --> 00:03:00,230
wealthiest 10 percent of America

90
00:03:02,150 --> 00:03:03,889
McCain's defeat in the primaries
didn't stop

91
00:03:04,250 --> 00:03:06,020
him from resisting Bush's platform.

92
00:03:06,110 --> 00:03:07,250
During his presidency

93
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,890
Senator McCain infuriated

94
00:03:10,130 --> 00:03:11,779
many fellow Republicans by opposing

95
00:03:12,380 --> 00:03:13,249
President George W.

96
00:03:13,610 --> 00:03:14,810
Bush's tax cuts

97
00:03:15,110 --> 00:03:16,729
and also by cosponsoring

98
00:03:17,420 --> 00:03:18,829
legislation that would provide

99
00:03:19,370 --> 00:03:21,590
a path to citizenship for
undocumented

100
00:03:21,620 --> 00:03:22,310
immigrants.

101
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,770
He was also alone in his party

102
00:03:24,830 --> 00:03:26,629
to speak out against so-called
enhanced

103
00:03:27,140 --> 00:03:29,300
interrogation techniques after 9/11.

104
00:03:29,660 --> 00:03:31,159
McCain's captors in Vietnam coerced

105
00:03:31,610 --> 00:03:33,319
a false confession from him so he

106
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:35,420
believed perhaps more strongly than
anyone

107
00:03:35,570 --> 00:03:36,950
that torture did not work.

108
00:03:38,190 --> 00:03:39,509
By 2008 his reputation

109
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:42,390
of a maverick became a full fledged
brand

110
00:03:42,510 --> 00:03:44,169
something he embraced wholeheartedly
for

111
00:03:44,370 --> 00:03:45,660
his second presidential bid.

112
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:47,130
I'm a maverick.

113
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:48,660
I've been called a maverick.

114
00:03:48,810 --> 00:03:50,490
He's the original maverick.

115
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:52,169
I think I'm going to have to cast

116
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:53,880
my vote for the maverick.

117
00:03:54,660 --> 00:03:56,770
Now we're called a team of
mavericks.

118
00:03:57,140 --> 00:03:58,649
But it quickly became clear that
Sarah Palin

119
00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:01,110
was a different kind of maverick

120
00:04:01,290 --> 00:04:02,879
the one that probably didn't help

121
00:04:03,150 --> 00:04:03,840
his campaign.

122
00:04:04,170 --> 00:04:05,669
One of his biggest regrets he says

123
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,709
in his new book was choosing Sarah

124
00:04:08,010 --> 00:04:09,930
Palin as his running mate over

125
00:04:09,990 --> 00:04:11,609
one of his best friends in the
Senate Joe

126
00:04:11,850 --> 00:04:12,570
Lieberman.

127
00:04:12,930 --> 00:04:14,399
But there was another way McCain's
maverick

128
00:04:14,850 --> 00:04:16,520
ways defied his own interests during

129
00:04:16,769 --> 00:04:18,270
his failed bid for the White House.

130
00:04:18,390 --> 00:04:20,790
We're scared of an Obama presidency.

131
00:04:20,910 --> 00:04:22,469
He resisted demagoguery

132
00:04:23,250 --> 00:04:24,569
and insisted that his supporters

133
00:04:25,290 --> 00:04:27,150
respect Barack Obama.

134
00:04:27,610 --> 00:04:29,219
I have to tell you he is

135
00:04:29,460 --> 00:04:30,690
a decent person

136
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:32,660
and a person that you do

137
00:04:32,670 --> 00:04:34,140
not have to be scared

138
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:36,260
as a United States now.

139
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:44,540
Change has come to America.

140
00:04:45,620 --> 00:04:46,910
Unfortunately John McCain

141
00:04:47,570 --> 00:04:49,279
couldn't make it recently

142
00:04:49,820 --> 00:04:52,160
claimed that he had never identified
himself

143
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:53,240
as a maverick.

144
00:04:54,260 --> 00:04:56,300
And we all know what happens in
Arizona

145
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:58,160
when you don't have ID.

146
00:05:00,110 --> 00:05:02,630
McCain was a tough critic of Obama's
administration.

147
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:04,639
But along the way he insisted on
open

148
00:05:04,970 --> 00:05:06,170
debate and decorum

149
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:07,969
and he reached across the aisle on
issues

150
00:05:08,330 --> 00:05:09,530
like immigration reform

151
00:05:11,060 --> 00:05:12,320
then Trump happened.

152
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:14,930
That is some group of people
thousands.

153
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:16,639
Suffice it to say their intra party

154
00:05:16,970 --> 00:05:19,070
relations left something to be
desired.

155
00:05:24,230 --> 00:05:25,699
Despite this McCain did insist

156
00:05:26,150 --> 00:05:28,280
on supporting Trump as the
Republican nominee.

157
00:05:28,340 --> 00:05:29,960
The best thing to do is put it

158
00:05:30,170 --> 00:05:31,040
behind us

159
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:32,900
and move forward until

160
00:05:32,990 --> 00:05:34,789
THIS at which point

161
00:05:35,060 --> 00:05:36,770
McCain withdrew his support

162
00:05:36,950 --> 00:05:38,210
for Donald Trump's presidency.

163
00:05:44,370 --> 00:05:45,719
McCain's resistance to Trump
continued

164
00:05:46,260 --> 00:05:47,580
right into the presidency.

165
00:05:47,850 --> 00:05:49,409
Senator McCain has stood out

166
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:51,239
by his willingness to oppose

167
00:05:51,660 --> 00:05:52,470
President Trump.

168
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:54,450
Other Republicans have been much
more

169
00:05:54,540 --> 00:05:56,490
willing to march in lockstep

170
00:05:56,520 --> 00:05:57,360
with President

171
00:05:59,110 --> 00:06:00,879
Then one fateful summer night on the

172
00:06:00,970 --> 00:06:01,660
Senate floor.

173
00:06:01,990 --> 00:06:02,859
After just being diagnosed

174
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:04,719
with brain cancer Sen.

175
00:06:05,140 --> 00:06:06,940
John McCain made an appearance

176
00:06:07,090 --> 00:06:08,649
to cast the deciding vote against

177
00:06:09,010 --> 00:06:10,810
the Republican effort to repeal

178
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:11,620
Obamacare.

179
00:06:12,340 --> 00:06:14,109
But it was a stunning vote in a very

180
00:06:14,410 --> 00:06:16,360
dramatic night in the Senate
chamber.

181
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:18,520
Except for one senator

182
00:06:19,060 --> 00:06:20,619
who came into a room at three
o'clock

183
00:06:21,070 --> 00:06:22,869
in the morning and went like that we

184
00:06:23,020 --> 00:06:24,220
would have had health care too.

185
00:06:25,450 --> 00:06:27,460
While he continues to fight his
brain cancer

186
00:06:27,670 --> 00:06:29,349
McCain has been preparing for his
eventual

187
00:06:29,830 --> 00:06:30,400
passing

188
00:06:30,850 --> 00:06:32,529
but jabs from the White House have

189
00:06:32,740 --> 00:06:33,550
not relented.

190
00:06:33,790 --> 00:06:35,780
A top White House communications
aide

191
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:37,389
mocks Senator John McCain's brain

192
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:39,250
cancer diagnosis.

193
00:06:39,340 --> 00:06:41,139
The White House still refusing to
apologize

194
00:06:41,890 --> 00:06:43,299
for that crass comment about Sen.

195
00:06:43,660 --> 00:06:45,580
John McCain ill

196
00:06:45,630 --> 00:06:46,449
will between Trump

197
00:06:46,750 --> 00:06:48,549
and McCain has gotten to such a
pitch that

198
00:06:48,700 --> 00:06:50,289
McCain has let it be

199
00:06:50,650 --> 00:06:52,299
known through a news report that he
would

200
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:54,580
rather Trump not attend his funeral.

201
00:06:55,090 --> 00:06:56,560
Let that sink in for a second.

202
00:06:56,920 --> 00:06:59,020
A lifelong Senator uninviting

203
00:06:59,050 --> 00:07:01,030
the sitting president of the United
States

204
00:07:01,090 --> 00:07:03,160
of the same party to his own

205
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:04,030
funeral.

206
00:07:04,450 --> 00:07:05,950
Now if that is not a maverick

207
00:07:06,370 --> 00:00:00,000
nothing is.
