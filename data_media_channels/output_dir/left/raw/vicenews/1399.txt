exactly why you need a movement that's

not bound by the courtesy or the

97
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:43,110

between keeping zombies in georgia and

113
00:04:17,260 --> 00:04:19,459
similar tactics have worked in Arkansas

Indiana Arizona and Tennessee so for

barber<font color="#CCCCCC"> on the n-double-a-cp the answer</font>

116
00:04:25,250 --> 00:04:28,520
<font color="#CCCCCC">is simple more boycott even if it takes</font>

Beasley sees the boycott is hurting

125
00:04:45,860 --> 00:04:47,570
Democrats now that one is governor I

126
00:04:47,570 --> 00:04:49,850
have all the respect in the world for

127
00:04:49,850 --> 00:04:52,040
Reverend barber and I think that in this

128
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:54,770
particular situation we agree on the

129
00:04:54,770 --> 00:04:58,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">ultimate goal</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> getting rid of hb2 but</font>

130
00:04:58,040 --> 00:05:00,080
we disagree on this specific tactic the

131
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:01,340
way that we make North Carolina

132
00:05:01,340 --> 00:05:04,070
successful is by repealing hb2 but at

133
00:05:04,070 --> 00:05:06,229
the same time I<font color="#E5E5E5"> am clearly not rooting</font>

134
00:05:06,229 --> 00:05:07,460
for North<font color="#CCCCCC"> Carolina to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be heard</font>

135
00:05:07,460 --> 00:05:09,200
economically in any way shape<font color="#CCCCCC"> or form I</font>

136
00:05:09,200 --> 00:00:00,000
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> us to be successful</font>
