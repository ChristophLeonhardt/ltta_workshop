1
00:00:00,761 --> 00:00:01,528
CONCESSION.

2
00:00:01,528 --> 00:00:03,797
SO WHERE DOES THE STORY GO NOW?

3
00:00:03,797 --> 00:00:06,099
GENERAL JACK KEANE, MARC

4
00:00:06,099 --> 00:00:10,303
THEISSEN AND MARIE HARF ON DECK

5
00:00:10,303 --> 00:00:11,338
TONIGHT.

6
00:00:11,338 --> 00:00:12,072
SENATOR GRAHAM, ALWAYS GOOD TO

7
00:00:12,072 --> 00:00:13,440
SEE YOU, THANKS FOR BEING HERE

8
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:13,774
TONIGHT.

9
00:00:13,774 --> 00:00:14,641
WHAT DID YOU SAY TO THE

10
00:00:14,641 --> 00:00:15,542
PRESIDENT ABOUT HOW HE DID?

11
00:00:15,542 --> 00:00:17,110
>> GREAT JOB.

12
00:00:17,110 --> 00:00:19,746
I THINK IT'S A GOOD FIRST STEP.

13
00:00:19,746 --> 00:00:20,480
HE FELT GOOD ABOUT IT.

14
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:22,449
HE SAID I HAD A GOOD MEETING

15
00:00:22,449 --> 00:00:22,949
WITH KIM JONG UN.

16
00:00:22,949 --> 00:00:26,119
WHAT REALLY STRUCK ME AS HE SAID

17
00:00:26,119 --> 00:00:27,521
LISTEN, THIS HAS GOT TO COME TO

18
00:00:27,521 --> 00:00:27,854
AN END.

19
00:00:27,854 --> 00:00:29,489
WE CAN'T LIVE WITH THIS KIND OF

20
00:00:29,489 --> 00:00:29,823
THREAT.

21
00:00:29,823 --> 00:00:31,258
HE'S GOT TO GIVE UP HIS NUCLEAR

22
00:00:31,258 --> 00:00:31,591
PROGRAM.

23
00:00:31,591 --> 00:00:33,660
I WANT TO MAKE IT A WIN-WIN.

24
00:00:33,660 --> 00:00:34,561
A WAR WOULD BE DEVASTATING.

25
00:00:34,561 --> 00:00:36,029
I DON'T WANT TO GO DOWN THAT

26
00:00:36,029 --> 00:00:36,763
ROAD.

27
00:00:36,763 --> 00:00:38,198
HE FELT PRETTY GOOD ABOUT THE

28
00:00:38,198 --> 00:00:38,765
INITIAL MEETING.

29
00:00:38,765 --> 00:00:40,067
WE'VE GOT A LONG WAY TO GO, BUT

30
00:00:40,067 --> 00:00:43,537
WHAT STRUCK ME THE MOST IS HOW

31
00:00:43,537 --> 00:00:44,237
MUCH THE PRESIDENT APPRECIATED

32
00:00:44,237 --> 00:00:46,139
HOW DEVASTATING A WAR WOULD BE,

33
00:00:46,139 --> 00:00:47,774
BUT IT WOULD BE EVEN MORE

34
00:00:47,774 --> 00:00:48,975
DEVASTATING TO WALK AWAY FROM

35
00:00:48,975 --> 00:00:49,776
HIS NUCLEAR THREAT.

36
00:00:49,776 --> 00:00:51,044
HE'S GOING TO END IT ON HIS

37
00:00:51,044 --> 00:00:52,579
WATCH IS WHAT HE TOLD ME.

38
00:00:52,579 --> 00:00:54,347
>> Martha: FASCINATING.

39
00:00:54,347 --> 00:00:56,383
THIS IS RAND PAUL SPEAKING OUT

40
00:00:56,383 --> 00:00:57,918
ABOUT SOMETHING THAT YOU SET

41
00:00:57,918 --> 00:00:59,119
ABOUT ALL OF THIS EARLIER.

42
00:00:59,119 --> 00:01:00,720
>> IN THE MIDST OF A HISTORIC

43
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:03,557
OPENING, PRESIDENT TRUMP

44
00:01:03,557 --> 00:01:04,224
ACTUALLY HAVING FACE-TO-FACE

45
00:01:04,224 --> 00:01:05,725
CONVERSATIONS WITH THE LEADER OF

46
00:01:05,725 --> 00:01:07,594
NORTH KOREA, LINDSEY GRAHAM

47
00:01:07,594 --> 00:01:09,162
TRYING TO DECLARE WAR IN THE

48
00:01:09,162 --> 00:01:11,164
MIDDLE OF THAT IS, I DON'T KNOW,

49
00:01:11,164 --> 00:01:13,133
SOMEONE LIVING IN AN ALTERNATIVE

50
00:01:13,133 --> 00:01:13,500
UNIVERSE.

51
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:14,534
IT'S NOT REALLY HELPFUL IN THE

52
00:01:14,534 --> 00:01:16,736
MIDDLE OF AN OPENING TO ACTUALLY

53
00:01:16,736 --> 00:01:18,638
TALK ABOUT IF WE DON'T LIKE THIS

54
00:01:18,638 --> 00:01:20,740
WE ARE GOING TO BOMB THEM OR

55
00:01:20,740 --> 00:01:21,274
DECLARE WAR ON THEM.

56
00:01:21,274 --> 00:01:22,676
>> Martha: ARE YOU TRYING TO

57
00:01:22,676 --> 00:01:24,678
DECLARE WAR ON NORTH KOREA,

58
00:01:24,678 --> 00:01:25,946
SENATOR  ?

59
00:01:25,946 --> 00:01:26,580
>> I'M ACTUALLY TRYING TO

60
00:01:26,580 --> 00:01:27,547
PREVENT ONE.

61
00:01:27,547 --> 00:01:28,748
HERE'S WHAT I BELIEVE ABOUT

62
00:01:28,748 --> 00:01:29,149
NORTH KOREA.

63
00:01:29,149 --> 00:01:29,850
THEY WOULDN'T BE TALKING TO

64
00:01:29,850 --> 00:01:31,218
TRUMP A LIST THEY BELIEVED HE

65
00:01:31,218 --> 00:01:33,253
WAS SERIOUS ABOUT USING MILITARY

66
00:01:33,253 --> 00:01:34,154
FORCE.

67
00:01:34,154 --> 00:01:35,455
PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS DONE MORE IN

68
00:01:35,455 --> 00:01:36,756
500 DAYS TO DEAL WITH

69
00:01:36,756 --> 00:01:38,492
NORTH KOREA THAN EVERY PRESIDENT

70
00:01:38,492 --> 00:01:40,327
IN THE LAST 30 YEARS.

71
00:01:40,327 --> 00:01:42,362
HERE'S WHAT THE CHOICES ARE FOR

72
00:01:42,362 --> 00:01:43,563
NORTH KOREA.

73
00:01:43,563 --> 00:01:44,865
COLUMN A'S ECONOMIC INCENTIVES,

74
00:01:44,865 --> 00:01:47,834
SECURITY GUARANTEES, A GOOD LIFE

75
00:01:47,834 --> 00:01:48,602
FOR NORTH KOREA AND SECURITY FOR

76
00:01:48,602 --> 00:01:50,337
THE REGIME.

77
00:01:50,337 --> 00:01:51,771
COLUMN B IS GOING TO BE THE

78
00:01:51,771 --> 00:01:52,606
DESTRUCTION OF THE REGIME IF YOU

79
00:01:52,606 --> 00:01:53,473
DON'T GIVE UP YOUR NUCLEAR

80
00:01:53,473 --> 00:01:56,143
WEAPONS PROGRAM.

81
00:01:56,143 --> 00:01:56,877
PRESIDENT TRUMP WASN'T KIDDING

82
00:01:56,877 --> 00:01:58,612
WHEN HE SAID HE WOULD USE

83
00:01:58,612 --> 00:01:59,079
MILITARY FORCE.

84
00:01:59,079 --> 00:02:02,149
IT IS THE LAST OPTION.

85
00:02:02,149 --> 00:02:02,849
CONTRARY TO WHAT SENATOR PAUL

86
00:02:02,849 --> 00:02:04,384
SAYS, THE ONLY WAY YOU'RE GOING

87
00:02:04,384 --> 00:02:05,819
TO GET NORTH KOREA TO GIVE UP

88
00:02:05,819 --> 00:02:06,586
THEIR NUCLEAR WEAPONS PROGRAM IS

89
00:02:06,586 --> 00:02:08,555
FOR THEM TO BELIEVE THEY ARE

90
00:02:08,555 --> 00:02:10,323
BETTER OFF WITHOUT IT THEN WITH

91
00:02:10,323 --> 00:02:11,992
IT, AND THAT COMES DOWN TO TRUMP

92
00:02:11,992 --> 00:02:13,493
CONVINCING THEM THAT THEY CAN NO

93
00:02:13,493 --> 00:02:14,995
LONGER GO ON THE PATH THEY ARE

94
00:02:14,995 --> 00:02:16,396
GOING WITHOUT A FIGHT.

95
00:02:16,396 --> 00:02:17,364
>> Martha: THAT'S WHAT I FOUND

96
00:02:17,364 --> 00:02:18,231
FASCINATING LAST NIGHT, BECAUSE

97
00:02:18,231 --> 00:02:20,333
THE ONE THING THAT WE KNOW FOR

98
00:02:20,333 --> 00:02:21,168
SURE IS THAT THE STATUS QUO

99
00:02:21,168 --> 00:02:30,076
CANNOT STAY.

100
00:02:30,076 --> 00:02:30,744
THAT'S WHAT THE NORTH KOREAN

101
00:02:30,744 --> 00:02:31,411
DICTATOR HAS FIGURED OUT, NO

102
00:02:31,411 --> 00:02:31,711
DOUBT.

103
00:02:31,711 --> 00:02:32,445
THAT'S WHY HE SHOWED UP TO TALK

104
00:02:32,445 --> 00:02:33,113
ABOUT THIS, BECAUSE HE KNOWS

105
00:02:33,113 --> 00:02:33,813
HE'S GOT PRESSURES AT HOME AS

106
00:02:33,813 --> 00:02:34,114
WELL.

107
00:02:34,114 --> 00:02:34,781
HE'S GOT THIS LITTLE SMALL

108
00:02:34,781 --> 00:02:35,482
GROWING ELITE CLASS WHICH IS

109
00:02:35,482 --> 00:02:36,550
MINOR, BUT THEY ARE PUSHING BACK

110
00:02:36,550 --> 00:02:38,118
ON HIM AND HE'S GOT THIS OTHER

111
00:02:38,118 --> 00:02:39,352
CHOICE THAT IF HE GOES BACK TO

112
00:02:39,352 --> 00:02:41,288
WHAT HE WAS DOING BEFORE, FIRING

113
00:02:41,288 --> 00:02:42,656
MISSILES ACROSS THE OCEAN AND

114
00:02:42,656 --> 00:02:44,624
TESTING NUCLEAR MISSILES

115
00:02:44,624 --> 00:02:46,326
POTENTIALLY THAT WE ARE GOING TO

116
00:02:46,326 --> 00:02:48,762
START FIRING BACK.

117
00:02:48,762 --> 00:02:49,496
>> CAN YOU IMAGINE WHAT WOULD

118
00:02:49,496 --> 00:02:51,798
HAPPEN IF KIM JONG UN THREW A

119
00:02:51,798 --> 00:02:54,901
FIT AND WALKED AWAY AND SAID I'M

120
00:02:54,901 --> 00:02:55,969
DONE WITH DONALD TRUMP AND FIRED

121
00:02:55,969 --> 00:02:57,137
A MISSILE OVER JAPAN?

122
00:02:57,137 --> 00:02:58,271
WHAT DO YOU THINK DONALD TRUMP

123
00:02:58,271 --> 00:02:59,339
WOULD DO?

124
00:02:59,339 --> 00:03:01,174
HE WOULD SEE THAT AS A

125
00:03:01,174 --> 00:03:01,875
PROVOCATIVE ACT AGAINST THE

126
00:03:01,875 --> 00:03:04,010
UNITED STATES AND HE WOULD

127
00:03:04,010 --> 00:03:04,945
RETALIATE.

128
00:03:04,945 --> 00:03:05,579
WHAT SENATOR PAUL DOESN'T

129
00:03:05,579 --> 00:03:06,746
UNDERSTAND IS THAT YOU ARE

130
00:03:06,746 --> 00:03:08,748
CUTTING THE LEGS OUT FROM

131
00:03:08,748 --> 00:03:09,749
PRESIDENT TRUMP WHEN YOU TALK

132
00:03:09,749 --> 00:03:11,318
ABOUT YOU WERE NOT REALLY

133
00:03:11,318 --> 00:03:12,118
SERIOUS ABOUT THE MILITARY

134
00:03:12,118 --> 00:03:12,586
OPTION.

135
00:03:12,586 --> 00:03:14,387
I DON'T WANT TO, IT WOULD BE

136
00:03:14,387 --> 00:03:16,356
DEVASTATING AS A LAST RESORT,

137
00:03:16,356 --> 00:03:16,990
BUT IF NORTH KOREA DOESN'T

138
00:03:16,990 --> 00:03:18,391
BELIEVE THAT WE ARE SERIOUS

139
00:03:18,391 --> 00:03:19,292
ABOUT THE MILITARY OPTION, YOU

140
00:03:19,292 --> 00:03:20,193
ARE NEVER GOING TO GET A

141
00:03:20,193 --> 00:03:22,495
PEACEFUL RESULT.

142
00:03:22,495 --> 00:03:24,497
>> Martha: HERE'S DENNIS

143
00:03:24,497 --> 00:03:25,365
RODMAN.

144
00:03:25,365 --> 00:03:28,201
I WANT TO PLAY THIS, THIS IS

145
00:03:28,201 --> 00:03:30,237
JAMES CLAPPER PRAISING DENNIS

146
00:03:30,237 --> 00:03:30,770
RODMAN.

147
00:03:30,770 --> 00:03:32,572
WATCH THIS.

148
00:03:32,572 --> 00:03:33,540
>> YOU'RE KIDDING ME!

149
00:03:33,540 --> 00:03:35,342
>> I HAVE LONG BEEN AN ADVOCATE

150
00:03:35,342 --> 00:03:37,177
OF INVOLVING DENNIS RODMAN.

151
00:03:37,177 --> 00:03:39,346
HE IS A UNIQUE PERSON SINCE HE

152
00:03:39,346 --> 00:03:40,180
HAS A RELATIONSHIP WITH BOTH

153
00:03:40,180 --> 00:03:42,215
KIM JONG UN AND WITH

154
00:03:42,215 --> 00:03:42,949
DONALD TRUMP.

155
00:03:42,949 --> 00:03:44,317
>> Martha: LINDSEY GRAHAM?

156
00:03:44,317 --> 00:03:46,486
>> I WOULD RATHER HAVE TRUMP IN

157
00:03:46,486 --> 00:03:48,154
THE ROOM THEN DENNIS RODMAN.

158
00:03:48,154 --> 00:03:49,723
I HOPE JAMES CLAPPER UNDERSTANDS

159
00:03:49,723 --> 00:03:50,624
THAT PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS BROUGHT

160
00:03:50,624 --> 00:03:52,225
THIS HISTORIC OPPORTUNITY ABOUT

161
00:03:52,225 --> 00:03:54,561
BECAUSE HE HAS BEEN STRONG IN

162
00:03:54,561 --> 00:03:55,729
THE FACE OF AGGRESSION.

163
00:03:55,729 --> 00:03:58,465
IF HE TO END THIS NUCLEAR THREAT

164
00:03:58,465 --> 00:03:59,833
BUT IF HE HAS TO USE FORCE HE

165
00:03:59,833 --> 00:04:00,133
WILL.

166
00:04:00,133 --> 00:04:01,534
DENNIS RODMAN IS NOT THE KEY TO

167
00:04:01,534 --> 00:04:05,038
A GOOD OUTCOME IN NORTH KOREA.

168
00:04:05,038 --> 00:04:05,605
IT'S DONALD J. TRUMP.

169
00:04:05,605 --> 00:04:06,406
PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS DONE A GOOD

170
00:04:06,406 --> 00:04:08,275
THING, A GOOD SERVICE TO THE

171
00:04:08,275 --> 00:04:10,377
COUNTRY, MAYBE TO NORTH KOREA.

172
00:04:10,377 --> 00:04:11,745
IF THEY ARE SMART ENOUGH TO TAKE

173
00:04:11,745 --> 00:04:12,379
THIS DEAL.

174
00:04:12,379 --> 00:04:13,780
I'VE GOT YOUR BACK, NOBODY WANTS

175
00:04:13,780 --> 00:04:16,950
A WAR BUT I'M HERE TO TELL YOU,

176
00:04:16,950 --> 00:04:18,051
MR. PRESIDENT, MAKE SURE HE GETS

177
00:04:18,051 --> 00:04:19,119
RID OF HIS NUCLEAR WEAPONS

178
00:04:19,119 --> 00:04:19,685
BEFORE IT'S TOO LATE.

179
00:04:19,685 --> 00:04:21,353
>> Martha: WANT TO ASK YOU ONE

180
00:04:21,353 --> 00:04:22,155
MORE QUESTION ABOUT ROB

181
00:04:22,155 --> 00:04:23,390
ROSENSTEIN AND THIS STORY TO

182
00:04:23,390 --> 00:04:23,690
MAKE.

183
00:04:23,690 --> 00:04:26,493
BASICALLY THAT THERE ARE

184
00:04:26,493 --> 00:04:27,227
SHOUTING MATCH THAT HAPPENED IN

185
00:04:27,227 --> 00:04:28,862
ONE OF THESE MEETINGS AND THAT

186
00:04:28,862 --> 00:04:31,031
HE THREATEN MEMBERS OF THE HOUSE

187
00:04:31,031 --> 00:04:32,932
INTEL COMMITTEE WITH SUBPOENAING

188
00:04:32,932 --> 00:04:33,233
THEM.

189
00:04:33,233 --> 00:04:34,934
HE SAID I WANT TO SEE YOUR
