AT THE STATE DEPARTMENT.
RICH, NORTH KOREA IS RESPONDING
DIRECTLY TO THE PRESIDENT.
>> GOOD MORNING.
NORTH KOREA SAYS THE UNITED
STATES IS PROVOKING IT AS IT
ENTERS THESE DISCUSSIONS
ALREADY WITH SOUTH KOREA AND
UPCOMING WITH PRESIDENT TRUMP.
IT SAYS IT'S NEGOTIATING FROM A
POSITION OF STRENGTH.
THIS IS ACCORDING TO A FOREIGN
MINISTRY SPOKESPERSON.
SAYING IT WOULDN'T BE CONDUCIVE
TO ADDRESSING THE ISSUE IF THE
U.S. MISCALCULATES THE DPRK AS
A SIGN OF WEAKNESS.
FOLLOWING THE SUMMIT BETWEEN
KIM JONG-UN AND SOUTH KOREAN
PRESIDENT MOON JAE-IN THE
INTERNATIONAL PRESSURE CAMPAIGN
DESIGNED TO ISOLATE NORTH KOREA
-- KIM JONG-UN CLAIMED IN
JANUARY THAT NORTH KOREA'S
NUCLEAR PROGRAM WAS COMPLETE
AND COULD HIT THE U.S. WITH A
MISSILE.
PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS ALSO SAID
HE WOULD WALK AWAY FROM THE
MEETING IF HE FOUND IT WEREN'T
FRUITFUL.
NORTH KOREA IS NOW ESSENTIALLY
THREATENING THE UNITED STATES
SAYING IT IS SETTING UP THE
CONDITIONS FOR FAILURE WHICH IT
SHOULD COULD RUIN THE HARDLY
WON ATMOSPHERE OF DIALOGUE.
>> Julie: U.S. OFFICIALS, RICH,
SAY, WITH GOOD REASON THEY ARE
CONCERNED ABOUT NORTH KOREAN
DECEPTION.
>> NORTH KOREA HASN'T BUILT UP
MUCH TRUST OVER THE LAST HALF
CENTURY.
THE U.S. AND OFFICIALS SAY
THEY'RE MINDFUL OF THAT AS DOES
THE CHAIRMAN OF THE HOUSE ARMED
SERVICES COMMITTEE.
>> I HAVE NO DOUBT THEIR HOPE
IS TO DIVIDE US FROM OUR ALLIES
IN SOUTH KOREA, TO EASE SOME OF
THE SANCTIONS, TO EASE THE
PRESSURE COMING FROM CHINA.
SO THAT THEY ARE NOT SO
ISOLATED IN THE WORLD.
>> THAT'S WHY U.S. OFFICIALS
SAY THEY'RE CONTINUING THE
SANCTIONS AND PRESSURE CAMPAIGN
AGAINST NORTH KOREA IN THE
LEAD-UP OF THE MEETING BETWEEN
KIM JONG-UN AND PRESIDENT TRUMP.
THE PRESIDENT SAYS THERE IS A
LOCATION, THERE IS A DATE SET
