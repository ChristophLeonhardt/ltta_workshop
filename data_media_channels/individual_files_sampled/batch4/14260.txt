a movie I actually think you should pay real money to see in theaters Kim Kardashian lobbying for another worthy cause and California wants to add two stars to our flag jerks details on those stories coming up today on the rebel was all right full disclosure Here I am a big fan of the dinesh d'souza films I'm a fan of the guy in general because I think he is a thought leader for our generation and he's not afraid to buck the stereotype and offer up unpopular opinions and facts because as we know a lot of facts are unpopular especially with the left because they don't align with their narrative on things like racism and entitlements and gun control now his films I think can be a little bit cheesy in presentation but the content is superb and they are well researched now before Obama was reelected he released the film 2016 Obama's America that film went on to become the second highest-grossing documentary in history at thirty three point four million dollars after seeing that film a lot of people started to question what it was specifically Obama had done for this country that was so good as the media would have you believe the movie did fairly well but his next film Hillary's America the secret history of the Democratic Party was the first time a lot of left-leaning Americans were faced with the uncomfortable truth that racism and inequality are endemic facets of liberal ideology it was a red pill moment for a lot of people who eventually decided that contrary to their democratic voting history they couldn't bring themselves to vote for Hillary Clinton it was the top grossing documentary in 2016 bringing in thirteen million dollars so that was still pretty stinkin good also my friend Steven Limbaugh scored the film so a little humble brag there so now doesn't Dinesh D'Souza has yet another film coming down the pike strategically due out a few months before midterms with the release date of August 3rd the film titled death of the nation will present comparisons between President Donald Trump and former President Abraham Lincoln D'Souza made the announcement via Twitter on Monday saying this announcing my new movie exploring the themes of fascism and way supremacy mark your calendar for the weekend of August 3rd he also tweeted this about the film Lincoln United his party and saved America from the Democrats for the first time can trump and we come together and save America for the second time now when I saw Hillary's America it was the summer before President Trump was elected I drove an hour and a half down to Orange County because that was the closest place that the movie was showing of course not here in LA and I sat in a near-empty theater thinking to myself if we lose this to Hillary Clinton that's it for our country the America that I grew up in will be destroyed now even though that theater was empty and it left me with this ominous feeling enough Americans felt the same way that I did to pull out a victory for Donald Trump and by proxy the preservation of our country at least for the next four years and here we find ourselves again fighting for America the stakes are almost as high if we lose the house the hands of conservative values in America first agenda will be tied president Trump has done a lot of great things in these first 17 months but we have got a long way to go in repairing the damage done by the last administration so I encourage you all to go see this film make sure you buy a ticket for this so it gets the box-office credit and then slink over and go see something else right after just kidding that's thieving no but really maybe I hate to be such a cheerleader for Kim Kardashian but y'all she keeps taking up the causes I really believe in a few weeks ago it was Alice Johnson's commutation and now something so so so important the Twitter edit option okay this isn't more important than someone's freedom but isn't the freedom to misspell and then edit almost as worthy how many tweets have you had to delete and repost after they've already gotten a hundred likes it's the worst on Wednesday Kardashian tweeted this I had a very good convo with at Jack this weekend at Kanye's bday and I think he really heard me out on the edit button at Jack as Jack Dorsey CEO of Twitter to which he replied now I see why I was invited yes Jack because truly almost the whole world wants you to do this of course there may be one good read not two if a tweet goes viral and has shared hundreds of thousands of times if the original tweeter edits the post it could create confusion if the original intent or essence of the tweet is altered but I don't think that's a good enough reason we can always screenshot it which happens very often when someone deletes a tweet we catch people doing this on Twitter all of the time when someone realizes that they tweeted something dumb or offensive or whatever if this was really that much of a concern deleting a tweet wouldn't be an option either but of course many people expressed their dissenting opinion in response to Kim Kardashian's tweet at anchorman 6-1-6 tweeted this an edit button would be one of the worst things you could bring to Twitter opening up so many more abusive tools and I cannot believe this has to be explained properly it's just a tweet your typos are not that damaging sir yes they are if I tweet something with a comma missing or a word misspelled that's coming right down delete delete delete like I am Hillary Clinton going through my emails at Beau Sloan 24 also tweeted this guy's if we get an edit button on Twitter it would defeat the entire purpose of the app think about how corrupt it would become people could change conversations from the past and twist words no no no again you troglodyte screenshot moving on to our last topic of my rebel buzz something that hits home with me the kal 3 initiative you have probably heard this along the way but California has sporadically over the years been trying to split us up and it makes sense California is like a bad relationship a lot of areas of the state we have nothing in common we have different morals we like different things we believe different things we've just stayed together for convenience also constitutionality but who cares about that anymore the initiative this time around is backed by Silicon Valley specifically venture capitalists Tim Draper personally I wouldn't mind splitting up California if we could divide it up so that I can go chill in new California with non lefties and salt-of-the-earth Americans which you would be surprised there are actually some of those here in California but that's not how they're dividing it it would be we give the Liberals of this state even more legislative power because each of the three new California's would encompass a populous metropolitan city ensuring that each new state remained blue and adding four more liberal senators yay plus what do we do for the flag aesthetically speaking here it's not gonna work adding two more stars it was Flag Day yesterday and I am not about to let these greedy liberal commies here in California screw up Old Glory start your own flag you are not welcome on ours in fact let's just take your existing star and give it to Guam or Puerto Rico you have already ruined the entire left coast so no more the proposal will go to a statewide vote this November as it has garnered the three hundred and sixty five thousand votes required to appear on the general ballot the three new states would separate California into norcal socal and Central Coast LA basin so basically NorCal would have San Francisco San Jose and Sacramento middle kau would just be called California and would have Los Angeles and its surrounding area and SoCal would have Orange County and San Diego now that's the only one that we could possibly hope to keep red but a lot of those areas went to Hillary in 2016 so that's a pretty risky gamble bottom line is it ain't gonna happen getting the majority vote in November could happen but then it would have to pass through state Congress and California Legislature not only would it be very difficult to make it happen it would be extremely costly and for a state who we're already kind of going through a rough patch as a slum town comparable to Calcutta we can't afford it so hopefully by the time this becomes a viable option I will be getting the you-know-what out thanks so much for watching everybody have a great weekend I'm Amanda head for the rebel if you enjoyed my commentary and want to hear more from
