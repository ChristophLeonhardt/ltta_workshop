KIM JONG-UN IS THE BIG WINNER. NANCY PELOSI TALKING ABOUT THIS LETTER THAT THE PRESIDENT TWEETED OUT HIMSELF. AMONG THE OUTREACH THOUGH IS A FUTURE LINE IN HERE, IF YOU CHANGE YOUR MIND, HAVING TO DO WITH THIS MOST IMPORTANT SUMMIT PLEASE DO NOT HESITATE TO CALL ME OR WRITE. THE WORLD AND NORTH KOREA PARTICULARLY HAS MISSED A OPPORTUNITY IS TRULY SAD MOMENT IN HISTORY. LET'S BRING IN OUR PANEL. TOM, YOUR THOUGHTS ON HOW THIS ALL CAME DOWN TODAY. I THINK THE BASIC POINT HERE IS THAT PRESIDENT TRUMP IS LEAVING CLEARLY AN OPENING TO TOWARDS CONTINUING THE SUMMIT ON JUNE 12th AS PREVIOUSLY BEEN ARRANGED. IN MY OPINION THAT WILL HAPPEN. I THINK YOU SEE COMING FROM BEHIND THE SCENES HERE IS A PRESSURE CALCULATION ON THE PART OF THE CHINESE TO SEE HOW FAR THEY CAN PUSH PRESIDENT TRUMP. I THINK THE CANCELLATION WAS DIRECTED AT BEIJING AS WELL. THE SECOND PART KIM JONG-UN RECOGNIZES THE SYMBOLISM OF THE ATTENDING OF THE SENATE IS AS COMPLICATED AS CONCESSIONS HE IS EXPECTED TO MAKE. THINK THE SUMMIT WILL GO AHEAD ON JUNE 12th. TO THAT POINT A FOX NEWS ALERT HERE. IN THE LAST FEW SECONDS NORTH KOREA SAYS TRUMP'S DECISION TO SCRAP THE SUMMIT IS NOT IN LINE WITH THE WORLD'S WISHES. NORTH KOREA SAYS THEY'RE WILLING TO RESOLVE ISSUES WITH THE U.S., KA * ACCORDING TO STATE RUN MEDIA. THIS DEVELOPS BY THE DAY, BY THE HOUR. PHOLGY. MOLLY. I THINK IT'S DISAPPOINI MOLLY. I THINK IT'S DISAPPOING BUT NOT COMPLETELY SURPRISING. YOU SEE NORTH KOREA AND THE U.S. PRETTY FAR APART. NORTH KOREA PROPOSED WHAT WE HAVE SEEN IN PAST DECADES. A PLEDGE TO EVENTUALLY DENUCLEARIZE. THE U.S. SAYS THAT WON'T WORK ANYMORE. WE WANT IT UP FRONT, ACCOUNTABILITY AND A TIMELINE. WE HEARD COMMUNICATIONS HAD BROKEN DOWN. I AGREE WITH TOM IT'S NOT THE END OF THE LINE BUT A NEGOTIATION PROCESS. WHAT IS INTERESTING ABOUT THE REPORT HERE IS PEOPLE WERE CAREFUL WHETHER NORTH KOREA WOULD SAY WE'RE WILLING TO MAKE THIS HAPPEN AND WORK TOWARDS IT OR IF THEY WOULD RESPOND WITH THE MISSILE TESTS AND OTHER BELLIGERENT ATTITUDES. IT'S A LONG BALL GAME STILL. AMY WE'RE GETTING FROM THE NORTH KOREANS THAT NORTH KOREA IS WILLING TO TALK TO THE UNITED STATES ANYTIME IN A RESPONSE OF THE DECISION TO PULL OUT OF THE SUMMIT SAYING THEY WANT TO RESOLVE THE ISSUES. YOU HEARD SENATOR MCCONNEL SAY THE NEXT STEP IS NORTH KOREA'S AND THIS IS IT. I'M FASCINATED TO WATCH THE WAY IN WHICH AMERICANS ARE REACTING TO THIS. TAKE AWAY THE BACK AND FORTH HERE IN WASHINGTON. IN POLLING WHAT WE HAVE SEEN THE LAST COUPLE OF WEEKS IS ACROSS THE BOARD THIS IS REPUBLICANS, DEMOCRATS, AND INDEPENDENTS WERE GIVEN THE IDEA OF A SIT DOWN BETWEEN THE PRESIDENT AND KIM JONG-UN HIGH MARKS. THEY LIKED THE IDEA. IN THE LAST CNN POLL PEOPLE SAW THIS AS TRUMP'S MOST POSITIVE MOVE AND HE RECEIVED HIS HIGHEST MARKS. THE AMERICAN PUBLIC OVER ALL IS SAYING I LIKE WHERE THIS IS GOING, WE HAVEN'T SEEN ANYTHING LIKE THIS, LET'S TROY IT. IF THIS GOES WILDLY OFF TRACK OR THE SUMMIT DOESN'T HAPPEN OR MORE SABER RATTLING FROM NORTH KOREA OR SOUTH KOREA DOES SOMETHING THERE IS A CONTINUING SORT OF CHAOS, DOES THAT THEN ULTIMATELY IMPACT THE WAY THAT VOTERS NOT ONLY SEE THE PRESIDENT BUT ULTIMATELY THE WAY HE HANDLES ANY OTHER FOREIGN POLICY OR FOREIGN POLICY CRISIS? RIGHT. TOM, QUICKLY WRAP THIS UP. YES, I THINK THE NORTH KOREAN'S KNOW THEY HAVE A INTEREST SKPEUGT DOWN AT THE SUMMIT. BEIJING WANTS THIS. THEY WANT TO SEE IT TRUMP IS MALLABLE. THE LETTER SUGGESTS HE IS NOT. THE MESSAGE WE SEE FROM THE NORTH, THAT'S AS NICE AS IT GETS
