THIS IS THE OVAL OFFICE.

37
00:01:01,192 --> 00:01:03,126
THERE'S NOTHING LIKE IT IN THE

38
00:01:03,127 --> 00:01:03,426
WORLD.

39
00:01:03,427 --> 00:01:06,830
THIS IS THE RESOLUTE DESK, VERY

40
00:01:06,831 --> 00:01:07,931
FAMOUS.

41
00:01:07,932 --> 00:01:10,567
THIS IS WHERE JOHN JOHN AT THE

JOHN KENNEDY WAS RIGHT HERE.

44
00:01:12,904 --> 00:01:14,471
A LITTLE DEAL THAT OPENS UP AND

I COULD SHOW YOU THAT PICTURE,

00:01:24,548 --> 00:01:27,684
SEVEN DESKS AND AS PRESIDENT YOU

50
00:01:27,685 --> 00:01:33,123
CAN CHOOSE ANY ONE OF THE DESKS.

>> Chris: WHEN YOU'RE SITTING

57
00:01:41,032 --> 00:01:43,600
AT THE DESK, HOW DO YOU MAKE

58
00:01:43,601 --> 00:01:43,967
DECISIONS?

59
00:01:43,968 --> 00:01:45,869
DO YOU AGONIZE OVER THEM?

60
00:01:45,870 --> 00:01:46,569
DO YOU A SECOND ASK YOURSELF?

61
00:01:46,570 --> 00:01:47,237
>> President Trump: I DON'T

62
00:01:47,238 --> 00:01:48,171
THINK ABOUT IT.

63
00:01:48,172 --> 00:01:49,773
I DON'T THINK ABOUT HOW I MAKE

64
00:01:49,774 --> 00:01:50,073
THEM.

65
00:01:50,074 --> 00:01:51,508
I MAKE WHAT I CONSIDER THE RIGHT

66
00:01:51,509 --> 00:01:51,875
DECISION.

67
00:01:51,876 --> 00:01:54,010
I HAVE GREAT PEOPLE WORKING AT

68
00:01:54,011 --> 00:01:54,511
THE WHITE HOUSE.

69
00:01:54,512 --> 00:01:56,146
THEY DON'T GET ENOUGH CREDIT.

70
00:01:56,147 --> 00:01:57,247
I HAVE SOME TREMENDOUSLY

71
00:01:57,248 --> 00:01:58,248
TALENTED PEOPLE AND I WILL TALK

72
00:01:58,249 --> 00:02:02,585
TO THEM AND SOMETIMES I WILL

73
00:02:02,586 --> 00:02:03,887
HAVE THEM GO AT EACH OTHER.

74
00:02:03,888 --> 00:02:05,722
I DO LIKE THAT.

75
00:02:05,723 --> 00:02:07,057
THEY ARE VERY COMPETITIVE PEOPLE

76
00:02:07,058 --> 00:02:10,627
AND AT THE END I MAKE A DECISIO

77
00:02:10,627 --> 00:02:10,993
DECISION.

78
00:02:10,995 --> 00:02:12,429
AND CERTAINLY ON THE ECONOMY,

79
00:02:12,430 --> 00:02:13,596
WE'VE MADE A LOT OF GOOD

80
00:02:13,597 --> 00:02:14,364
DECISIONS AND I WANT TO KEEP IT

81
00:02:14,365 --> 00:02:16,499
THAT WAY.

82
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:18,101
>> Chris: DO YOU EVER

83
00:02:18,102 --> 00:02:18,668
SECOND-GUESS YOURSELF?

84
00:02:18,669 --> 00:02:20,203
>> President Trump: ALL THE

85
00:02:20,204 --> 00:02:21,504
TIME.

86
00:02:21,505 --> 00:02:22,739
I'VE DONE THINGS WHERE I WISHED

87
00:02:22,740 --> 00:02:24,140
I WENT A DIFFERENT ROUTE.

88
00:02:24,141 --> 00:02:25,976
BUT THEN WHAT YOU DO IS YOU

89
00:02:25,977 --> 00:02:27,877
CHANGE COURSE AND YOU BRING IT

90
00:02:27,878 --> 00:02:30,547
BACK.

91
00:02:30,548 --> 00:02:31,214
>> Chris: TOUGHEST DECISION

92
00:02:31,215 --> 00:02:34,017
YOU'VE HAD TO MAKE AS PRESIDENT?

93
00:02:34,018 --> 00:02:35,051
>> President Trump: I THINK

94
00:02:35,052 --> 00:02:35,986
NORTH KOREA HAS BEEN VERY TOUGH.

95
00:02:35,987 --> 00:02:38,855
WE WERE VERY CLOSE.

96
00:02:38,856 --> 00:02:39,990
WHEN I TOOK OVER,

97
00:02:39,991 --> 00:02:41,791
PRESIDENT OBAMA SAID THAT'S BY

98
00:02:41,792 --> 00:02:42,792
FAR THE BIGGEST PROBLEM THAT

99
00:02:42,793 --> 00:02:44,260
THIS COUNTRY HAS.

100
00:02:44,261 --> 00:02:45,829
AND I THINK WE HAD A REAL

101
00:02:45,830 --> 00:02:46,763
DECISION AS TO WHICH WAY TO GO

102
00:02:46,764 --> 00:02:49,199
IN NORTH KOREA.

103
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:49,899
AND CERTAINLY SO FAR I'M VERY

104
00:02:49,900 --> 00:02:52,068
HAPPY WITH THE WAY WE WENT, VERY

105
00:02:52,069 --> 00:02:55,972
GOOD RELATIONSHIP.

106
00:02:55,973 --> 00:02:58,074
I DON'T BELIEVE THAT.

107
00:02:58,075 --> 00:03:01,111
COULD BE.

108
00:03:01,112 --> 00:03:02,312
THAT'S THE WAY IT GOES, THAT'S

109
00:03:02,313 --> 00:03:04,014
THE WAY IT GOES.

110
00:03:04,015 --> 00:03:07,584
I GO WITH THE WAY WE HAVE TO GO.

111
00:03:07,585 --> 00:03:08,818
BUT SO FAR IT'S BEEN GOOD.

112
00:03:08,819 --> 00:03:12,455
WE HAVE A VERY GOOD RELATIONSHI

113
00:03:12,456 --> 00:03:12,922
RELATIONSHIP.

114
00:03:12,923 --> 00:03:13,957
WE MADE I THINK SOME GREAT

115
00:03:13,958 --> 00:03:16,693
DECISIONS FOR THE PEOPLE OF THIS

116
00:03:16,694 --> 00:03:17,861
COUNTRY AND I DO -- I PUT

117
00:03:17,862 --> 00:03:20,330
AMERICA FIRST AND EVERYBODY

118
00:03:20,331 --> 00:03:20,997
SHOULD PUT THEMSELVES FIRST.

119
00:03:20,998 --> 00:03:25,135
IT'S NOT LIKE EVERYBODY ELSE --

120
00:03:25,136 --> 00:03:28,405
OTHER COUNTRIES ARE PROUD OF

121
00:03:28,406 --> 00:03:30,173
THEIR COUNTRIES BUT WE WERE

122
00:03:30,174 --> 00:00:00,000
PUTTING OUR COUNTRY IN MANY
