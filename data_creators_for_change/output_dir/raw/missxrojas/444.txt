00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,370

6
00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:13,830
people started leaving campus packing up

7
00:00:13,830 --> 00:00:15,900
their cars the realities are<font color="#CCCCCC"> removing is</font>

8
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:17,520
starting to sink in more than it has

9
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:19,230
before so it strange to kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of pause</font>

10
00:00:19,230 --> 00:00:20,609
for a second and realize<font color="#E5E5E5"> that people are</font>

11
00:00:20,609 --> 00:00:22,439
<font color="#CCCCCC">actually getting ready</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to go and these</font>

12
00:00:22,439 --> 00:00:23,939
are people who I might<font color="#E5E5E5"> not see ever</font>

13
00:00:23,939 --> 00:00:25,740
again thinking about a levels i really

14
00:00:25,740 --> 00:00:27,510
don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> know how</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i have the endurance to</font>

15
00:00:27,510 --> 00:00:28,980
do that I mean they went on for such a

16
00:00:28,980 --> 00:00:30,630
long time for weeks and weeks and weeks

17
00:00:30,630 --> 00:00:33,239
and the whole time I was working so hard

18
00:00:33,239 --> 00:00:35,190
and yet for two weeks this year I had

19
00:00:35,190 --> 00:00:37,469
really not that many exams and for some

20
00:00:37,469 --> 00:00:39,239
reason I find it so difficult when in

21
00:00:39,239 --> 00:00:40,590
comparison to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the amount of work that I</font>

22
00:00:40,590 --> 00:00:42,840
did for<font color="#E5E5E5"> a levels and gcse's it really</font>

23
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:44,610
like wasn't that much I do find it a bit

24
00:00:44,610 --> 00:00:46,469
worrying that my kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of work endurance</font>

25
00:00:46,469 --> 00:00:47,820
is going down<font color="#E5E5E5"> especially when it's</font>

26
00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:49,379
