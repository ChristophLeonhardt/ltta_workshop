hi max keiser Oleg Archy what's that Bernie Sanders does Stacy I want to call your attention to this headline from last week and this is a headline that could almost be ripped from a conspiracy theory site but in fact it's from The Guardian and it's Bernie Sanders saying at Bernie Sanders warns of international oligarchy after paradise' papers leaked Bernie Sanders is warned that the world is rapidly becoming an international oligarchy controlled by a tiny number of billionaires highlighted by the revelations and the Paradise Papers that was the first thing I thought when I saw about these paradise' papers leaked because all of it is technically legal all of this shelter and the money offshore you know you could do those Venn diagrams of not even that just like connect the dots sort of Rachel Maddow asked sort of thing that they're all linked together whether it's Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump or every single head of state and every single head of major corporations in that state or domiciled in that state they're all connected through these that the banking system that is like a separate banking system unique just for them yeah the social justice networked in a study just recently and they concluded that there's between twenty and thirty trillion dollars that is held offshore there's part of the parallel economy that's one and a half times the GDP of America they concluded it's about two hundred thousand people they pay no tax they invest in assets that keep going higher in value because the central bank's print money in a way that makes the assets that they own go up in price but no wages no wages don't go up that's financial engineering deregulation post Reagan Reagan Thatcher so it's like you have a huge field you're getting that field and the water that's supposed to irrigate the crops that it just is diverted only to the folks that are in that twenty to thirty trillion dollar offshore parallel financial universe so wage growth is not there job growth has been transformed to part-time jobs jobs essentially and the taxes are born to pay for society by those people that are not part of that illegal apartheid state you know I've said before it's uh it's apartheid unless you're committing fraud now they say it's not it's it's it's legal but the folks who it used to be illegal but they they've changed the law to make it legal if it's legal because you know it's gets back to what Basquiat said about looting if you let looters control the top they'll have looting throughout the economy it John Locke said in 17m time you know if there's a if the social contract is but you don't need to get on track I mean I know they've gumgum wind you got here I mean you can just give me a simple cue you don't need them whip them out as it were and like to try to distract me I mean I'll take that just a simple cut you know sign would would suffice me you mentioned the Tax Justice Network because they're in this next headline about these paradise' papers and again you know these sort of leaks keep on coming and there were the HSBC leaks and then the the Luxembourg leaks the lux leaks and then there was the Panama papers leaks and everybody shouts but nothing happens none of the laws changed everything still say stays the same they have their alternative you know banking system and financial system and tax system they also want in these trade deals to get their own justice system the investor state dispute settlement so they would be removed from any of our ordinary justice which remember the system we live in is very harsh and very severe justice is harsh taxes are harsh Obamacare is harsh education cost of hearts their system is like so smooth no barriers no ease of movement no taxes and everything note no justice for deferred prosecution very prosecution unicorns and lollipops free money from the Fed asset prices up perpetuity beautiful the world they live in that's what the world they live in and then but we're stuck in these like bordered sort of countries we have an axe oh yeah ghetto as you can see arc whatever nation you live in you're essentially stuck in a ghetto and and yet our media will like set up these paradigms of like here's the right here's the left choose one of the teams and you know your news media will hail things like Tim Cook and Steve Jobs and Apple is these great wonderful people and they should protect us from protect our democracy from evil voices and keep evil voices out and things like that so I want to turn to one of the what the paradise paper showed about what Apple did in terms of setting up one of their divisions one of their tax loopholes one of their offshore havens through Jersey and this is from John Christensen and he of the director of the Tax Justice Network and he tweeted that Apple B Apple chose Jersey these are the key criteria guiding the choice what does this say about Jersey but what does it also say about Apple because remember the news here says Apple should be one of the corporations that protect us from you know any fake news or things like that so they wanted it in writing for example there are a few things that they wanted like in writing that they are guaranteed like this like no taxes but the number four point is quite remarkable because again they're being asked that all these tech giants are being asked to protect our democracy here's what Apple wanted guaranteed from Jersey is there a credible opposition party or movement that may replace the current government so they were afraid of a credible opposition party they wanted to make sure there were none there in order to before they would set up their cash there that before they would put I would I was gonna say launder or hide but again as legal all this stuff is legal for them you try to go there and set it up yourself you'll be like arrested and thrown in Guantanamo but there you have it that wouldn't fall into the category of election interference why they're either overtly or covertly here you have Tim Cook CEO of Apple engaging in the United Kingdom in election interference the biggest company in the world soon to be a trillion dollar company strong-arming Teresa may like she got Iceland by Tim Cook Tim Cook's Weinstein it to Ted you know Teresa may saying we don't want as long as you can control your government this is the SPO opposition we don't want to ever pay taxes okay we want to use the islands like a Weinstein pimp okay okay Teresa may and traces may like come on come on it's so disgusting your duplicity from that media when they come at me I'm sorry I'd hate to bring reality into the mix Jersey has their own their sovereign so they have their own yeah I staple on a vagina and I'm a woman okay well so let's go on to the next headline again so here again is another story about you know this two-tier sort of system that they have and they stand and yet the people stuck in the ghetto two borders the bordered ghettos you know we keep on fighting for like the guy the Tim Cook's of the world that say the right thing they sound all cool and groovy and very progressive so here's another headline about how you know those pharmaceutical giants who help us they they do so much work for us they invent all these great you know drugs and pharmaceuticals that will save us and cure us and they make all these cute commercials about all the help they provide for little children and protect your family yeah you know the list of the symptoms you know the symptoms but the what they call them you know the the side effects side effects vary so everyone read that it's like every single minute there's a new drug add it for some phantom disease like shaky leg syndrome that they make up then they get a grant from some you know corrupt congressmen in America billions of dollars and the side effect there's always make may induce suicide may induce suicide may induce suicide well you know the American flag is inducing suicide because you look at that you say oh it's a Pharma khakhra see it's a Formica Kaka let's look one of the ways they they manage to get away with such high cost of drugs is that they say they need to research and develop new drugs so that's before we rant about that let's look at the headline the headline is most new drug patents are for old remedies research shows the US patent system was designed to protect new innovations but drug makers are more often than not using it to protect old ones at least seventy four percent of drugs associated with new patents or medicines already on the market according to research by Robin Feldman director of the Institute for innovation law at the University of California Hastings College of Law the percentage reached eighty percent in three of the years studied in 2005 to 2015 so as soon as evergreening so they make a slight change or in the manufacturing process of the same sort of aspirin say and they say well we need to extend our patent by another 14 years so basically they're saying that seventy four percent of them are just evergreening is there's no new innovation patents and trademarks it's limited monopoly time for a limited time they abuse the system to create perpetual patents perpetual copyrights it's a complete subversion of the Constitution which says explicitly article 17 authored by Thomas Jefferson that the original copyright for example is 14 years is seven plus seven years patents similarly for a limited time you get a monopoly protection when you extend it out to infinite amount of time you're effectively giving your country America a lobotomy and that's what these pharmaceutical companies are good at they're reaching into our craniums and they're ripping our brains out and stepping on them with a big black boot and they call that capitalism because what it's not it's you know and of course you know Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton as Secretary of State then they were going around the world and they were trying to basically get these trade deals they were calling them trade deals TPP and TTIP and those were really for pharmaceutical companies to basically extend these patent copyright protections around the world but remember we covered this at the time all these pharmaceutical giants were trying to do tax inversions so here they were fitting from the cyst this particular ghetto in the US where we have very high pharmaceutical and medical costs and they were trying to get the protection of this country to maintain these high medical costs our Masuda coal costs and yet didn't want to pay taxes to this system where is bankrupting still hundreds of thousands of americans go bankrupt every year because of medical costs and here they you know this the same system it's this financial oligarchy this international oiligarchy as Bernie Sanders calls it this is the same class and it's happening it happens right in front of our face all day long and are in our headlines vivisectionist eugenicist and Tim Cook who runs America's fortune 500 and Pfizer advisor lobotomist but as it says this study definitively shows a stifling competition is not limited to a few Pharma bad apples rather it is a common and pervasive problem endemic to the pharmaceutical industry endemic there start reading international business model their business model it's well we got to go to the break and you know if it gets really bad don't don't bother us stay right there welcome back to the cosmic port I'm max guys our time now to turn to max Blumenthal senior editor alternates gray zone project co-host of moderate rebels with Ben Norton welcome max Bullough Tom good to be with you right now you know um there's a few journalists in America that I really paid close attention to Matt Taibbi for his one you're another one I mean really on the front line of investigative journalism in this country it's a craft that is diminished with the rise of you know shouty journalism of which I'm part but you're actually doing stuff and investigating and bringing you know shedding light on in a moment of darkness and in this country's history journalistically in my view let me pick your brain up here in 2016 les Moonves of CBS said the Trump may not be good for the country but he sure was good for business can we say this about Russia gate a little bit when I watch watch Rachel Maddow she seems to be cashing in on the Russia gate thing like you know what we used to say Alex Jones was taking things to a level of ratings milking is this happening on the left now max yeah I mean it all started in the 2016 campaign and I start I was watching CNN and I started noticing they were having basically like infomercials for Melania businesswomen entrepreneur model you know they were pumping up Trump on CNN so much and it was Jeff Zucker who understood the appeal of Trump to the American pop to the American public this is the former producer of Trump's Apprentice which introduced Trump to a national audience now he was the CEO of CNN and he was going to pump Trump up and then as soon as Trump gets elected CNN decides we're gonna tear him down and appeal to this resistance crowd which represents everything to the left of the far-right Trump including you know neoconservatives or never Trump Republicans they had a big audience Jake Tapper who does the primetime show for CNN his ratings are up 53% because he's pushing that resistance model of just anything anti Trump while promoting war and Rachel Maddow is a really fascinating character I mean this is someone who you know I personally almost have a seizure every time I watch or just her it's just very difficult aesthetically the audio it's really hard for me to tolerate watching her but a lot of people I think from an older demographic baby boomers they really enjoy her right now but if you actually look at her numbers prior to the election compared to now it's one of the most dramatic shifts we've seen in the history of cable news she's now the number one cable news host prior to the election or ratings were in the toilet she was talking about actual Republican antics actual right-wing media the Koch brothers Robert Mercer the actual people who influenced right-wing politics in the US now according to a Content study done by performed by Aaron Matta a journalist for the intercept the majority of Rachel Maddow's content focuses on Russia Gate and after her point that the narrative is like that it's whittling down you know it gets because there's no evidence there's no smoking gun there's no proof and there there they're just seeking every little tidbit that comes across somehow it's Russia gates become farcical yeah and but as you point out the ratings are going higher and they are you know I it seems like there's Glenn Beck you know introduced the idea of crying on television and then you know to emic imitate Alex Jones and these were considered to be outside of the mainstream by a big factor and yet now this is what the the part of the way that Rachel Maddow is now kind of bringing in the stylistics are at the same time criticizing people like Alex Jones but there's there's just no there there right I mean what's the status now of this Russia gay story it seems like there's just just there's nothing there what's currently going on yeah I mean what we've seen in the past few days is the Paradise Papers were leaked and this should be an explosive expose of international capital and corruption tax shelters should be really the heart of this investigation but instead we've seen very little about that why because the international consortium of investigative journalism which also did the Panama papers has refused to release these documents to the public and instead they're leaking them out to mainstream publications like the New York Times then it's filtering out through MSNBC and CNN and they're focusing almost with laser light precision on anything Russia related and what we've seen you know I have no sympathy for any of these international oligarchs but what we've seen is pure unadulterated McCarthyism focusing on figures like Yuri Milner who is an apolitical Silicon Valley oligarch who happens to be Russian Jewish oligarch and what the Guardian did was paint connections between Yuri Milner and Jared Kushner and a company that Jared Kushner had invested in as some kind of nefarious evidence of collusion when in fact Yuri Milner has close ties to the Clinton family he did a panel at Davos with Eric Schmidt the CEO of Google and Chelsea Clinton he has given an award to Morgan Freeman who's become one of the kind of spokesmen for Russia gate through a neocon front group I mean Yuri Milner is a friend of Mark Zuckerberg so he's pretty much what we're talking about is oligarchs doing business with each other and it's framed in terms of anyone who does business with anyone who is a Russian national being scandalous that's McCarthyism I mean even in the McCarthy era people were not were drummed up at least for communist suspicions not on the basis of simply coming from a country that we don't like and so this is what we're seeing in the past few days but if you look at any of the things that Rachel Maddow or any of these figures have been covering for example that Russia attempted to hack voting systems in 21 States when these stories fall apart and when the Secretary of State's of California Texas and Wisconsin say no the Russians actually didn't try to hack our voting systems there's never any follow up and so people are left with the impression that these stories are true even when went on one after another they fall apart let's talk about some of the risks this type of approach takes because I was watching these cable stations this week and I was tuning in I'm like I want to find out what's happening in Saudi Arabia there's like a coup going on there yeah people are getting killed there helicopters are crashing there's Lina well it's a big story here and nothing cover it yeah you know there so the risk is not only journalism but they're they're not a covering stuff that's actually important your thoughts on this yeah that that's a great point I was actually watching MSNBC last night not there any fault of my own but I just happened to be in a place where it was on and there was no coverage of Saudi Arabia where a purge is taking place where Mohammed bin Salman has taken the heads of all of the media agencies that are responsible for all of the media in the Arab world except for Al Jazeera and put them in a de facto internment camp at the ritz-carlton and Riyadh this should be a huge story beyond that Donald Trump has sold them something like $150 150 billion dollars of weapons his foreign policy is essentially controlled by Saudi Arabia and the UAE with respect to the Middle East we're looking at the possibility of region-wide destabilization because of these moves and MSNBC I mean for two hours they didn't touch it they only talked about Trump's visit to North Korea and his incendiary rhetoric and this is the real source of foreign influence I mean we just had week of congressional hearings about Russian Facebook ads which include you know cute images of puppies and a LGBT themed buff Bernie coloring book was also featured in one of these ads and you know you had these hysterical hearings but when are we gonna talk about the real source of foreign influence in Washington and that emanates from Saudi Arabia and in the pro-israel lobby primarily it's never covered on cable news or very seldom um quickly I don't know if you've watched like Democracy Now but it seems like Amy Goodman and democracy now watch for years has also kind of fallen under the sway of this Rachel Maddow Russia gate hoax hysteria yeah is that a fair assessment what he what's your what do you thought there yeah yeah you've definitely definitely seen a depreciation in the quality of democracy now not only reporting various Russia gate rumors you know prioritizing these stories and their news that you know they introduced the show with but also bringing in guests like Kurt icon Wald who is the discredited Newsweek reporter who has had to delete several of his articles as a result of a libel lawsuit which discredited his reporting on some of you know the pieces that went viral during the calculation the cosa the mine I mean Amy Goodman she's running the show there there's no question about it is she feels that by compromising her journalistic standards she's somehow helping to undermine Trump because she feels it's her duty as a citizen above her responsibilities as a journalist that that this man must be impeached and she's going to completely change the character of her show in this effort because I mean why would she make that calculation it's so blatantly unprofessional yeah yeah I mean I've known her for years I used to be I would say at least an occasional guest if not a frequent guest I'm not welcome back on for whatever reason and many of my colleagues who you know focused on issues like Palestine we're not we're not going on there anymore what we've seen is sort of a but she's been critical the idea for years yes my cutting edge yeah of all the reporting on Israel Palestine issues there's Amy Goodman she's in Palestine she's talking to people but see there's people are getting occupy they're getting murdered there she is right now this is all been washed away it's just everything is real Sookie a big fat kisser made me good him now well it's not a big fat kiss it's just a shrug of the shoulders I think she's covered it like twice in the past year a lot of the issues that democracy now is known for falling by the wayside and she's you know really an acting kind of a pale imitation of MSNBC I assume her ratings are up she's becoming more popular with the resistance crowd and she likes it but we're witnessing just across the board a gigantic liberal cultural meltdown in the Trump era and the quality of everything connected to liberalism has just evaporate actually lose popularity in the Trump era you know the recent actually losing popularity yeah how's that possible what what what's wrong with these people yeah the Democratic Party's at a 25 year low according to a recent poll I think it's a CNN poll it's gone down seven points since March alone as it's been cranking up the Russia gay conspiracies the numbers are lowest among non-whites and among youth and it has to do with the fact of the that it's elevated candidates like Hillary Clinton through rigged primaries over the most popular candidate in the US and the party refuses to offer a critique of the forces and the system that are driving people's lives into literal ruin so I think there's just a lack of resonance there with the Democratic Party there's a major disconnect and they've kind of crafted all of their messaging towards a really narrow contingency contingent of coastal elites that most people don't relate to all right we just finished the trip we went all across the country 16 different states and the Russia Gate Oaks is completely absent from any discussion you know outside of kind of the coast of New York and LA coast and if people are not really there's not focused on it because they don't see that how that really affects their lives they don't there's never been any proof there's never been any evidence of it there's nothing going on to suggest that this is something they need to focus on and yet the ha how does that what's the disconnect between the people running the party who presumably want power and and their inability to understand that there losing power like happen did they turn the charts upside down are they they just look at it like we're losing now we're winning are they just brain dead what's going on here yeah I think you're looking at a small group of people who are swamp creatures who are living in a very insular bubble whether it's you know liberal Hollywood whether it's Washington the Beltway culture whether it's midtown Manhattan whatever it is they're out of touch with the kind of pain that most people are feeling along with the moral injury of people who have family members who are veterans who served in Iraq and Afghanistan they're not talking about war and peace and these issues and what they really I think they thought after Trump was elected was that number one he had actually won through a secret Russian intelligence operation and therefore he was not a legitimate president and therefore they could impeach him through some kind of Watergate style investigation and meanwhile they'd all get good ratings and everyone would read their articles about these collusion stories right and it hasn't worked you got a cut there you stay out for another segment yes okay cool well that's gonna do it for this edition of the Kaiser report with me max guys are in Stacy Robert like to thank our guest max Blumenthal if you want to catch us on twitter it's Kaiser report until next time bye y'all
