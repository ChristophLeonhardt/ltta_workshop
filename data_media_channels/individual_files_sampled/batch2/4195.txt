we all want want what's best for this country that's what I heard and mr. Trump's remarks last night that's what the country needs a sense of unity a sense of inclusion a respect for our institutions our way of life rule of law and respect for each other I hope that he maintains that spirit throughout this transition and I certainly hope that's how his presidency has a chance to begin well despite those optimistic words President Obama went through some inner turmoil after the election of Donald Trump according to a new book by former Obama advisor Ben Rhodes excerpts attaint obtained by the New York Times revealed Obama's struggle to understand what led to the rise of Trump and his doubts over the timing of his own presidency telling aides quote sometimes I wonder whether I was 10 or 20 years too early joining me now is Jonathan Capehart columnist for The Washington Post and back with me now Tiffany cross and lawrence O'Donnell I'm gonna start with you Jonathan first of all I think the nostalgia factor you yet that seems like that was 10 years ago right for the president to say maybe he came along 10 years too early what do you make of that assessment of President Obama of himself well what that acknowledges is that the campaign run by President Trump was like lifting up a rock in the forest and watching all of the bugs and worms squirm out from underneath yeah I think the president who ran on hope and change and you know the are better angels and rising to the ideals of who we are as the American people that represented by his election and then re-election seeing that someone who is the antithesis of him in every way yeah get elected was personally galling but also I think in that reflection of maybe I was 10 or 20 years too too early as maybe the country wasn't ready for me maybe the country maybe I was an aberration is what I kind of get yeah in that quote it's amazing to hear an introspective thoughtful president again yeah especially since you know President Obama if people were lucky enough to talk to me the end was relentlessly positive like he was trying to if you spoke to him and had the opportunity he was trying to be very positive you saw that grim-faced picture of all his aides he was trying to say everything's gonna be okay the world aren't gonna survive it's gonna be fine but then you you know realize when he's you know in sort of innermost thoughts a couple clips in the book President Obama reportedly says what if we were wrong maybe we pushed too far maybe people just want to fall back into their tribe and then one more clip and this one is even in sort of Warren searing that few moments shook mr. Obama more than the decision by voters to replace him with a candidate who had questioned his very birth we do with that I mean even watching that soundbite I had that like single Denzel tears hardening but you know I will say I definitely echo President Obama's sentiments but I do think amongst a lot of people of color we always knew that there the racism that resides in this country was laying dormant it didn't disappear like we were not post-racial but just to hear it just these thoughtful words from a thoughtful leader who can echo these kind of sentiments at a time like right now who can put the country first and it's not about him but it's beyond him in terms of him being ten years too soon I think most transformative leaders might have these thoughts when MLK was around he was you know considered divisive at the time and people who love to bring up his words as a way to champion docile black people I mean those would be some of the same people who would have criticized him back then and just for sure at the top levels of government absolutely I can understand why he might feel that way I disagree but when you look at what he inspired he cast a wide net of influence so now you have all these Obama alumni making yeah major rights all over them all over the country you got Lauren Underwood in Chicago you've got Colin already just won his primary in Texas you've got a Marc camp in a jar in California all these historic candidates and either just you know in the federal level but then you have local candidates Michael Blake right here in New York he's got people doing amazing things in a private sector people like Google and Airbnb there's been this great migration of Obama alumni in the tech sector now so I think you have to look at it on a larger scale and look at the macro and the micro and I think you know his influence happened when it was supposed to yeah and it will ripple through time for generations to come and when you look at what happened that led us here when we had George Bush in office we were coming off the heels of you know the huge Iraq war misstep he had we had to have George Bush to get it Barack Obama correct yeah and I think that's at some point it you know was it presidents are reflections of each other right and then but for George Bush maybe the country wouldn't have you know taking a chance on and a relatively unknown guy named Barack Hussein Obama but for me in a lot of ways but for Barack Obama you don't get Donald Trump well you know the real rhythm of this is normally after eight years of one party you get the other party it's just as simple as that I mean I was absolutely certain at the end of the eight years of George W Bush that the Democrat was going to win whoever that Democrat was and and I also was betting that was going to be barackobama but you know when I hear a statement like that a Reedus that went that from from Barack Obama who is as we said in an introspective and thoughtful and very wise man and a brilliant writer and he says something like maybe I came along 20 years too soon my reaction to that is what do you mean which is to say I cannot possibly fill in the paragraph that that is the first sentence of if it is spoken by Barack Obama because his mind is too supple too complex too rich compared to my own to fill out what the rest of that thought is and I think he's got a really interesting thought there and when you when you hear him in an extended interview like he most recently did with David Letterman you you understand that wherever that first line began is not did not tell you where that answer was gonna go 75 or 200 words later and so I'm not sure about that but but it's a I do think it is ain't a it sounds like the kind of feeling that you get me in govern because in governments it's a very slow incremental mode of progress and a presidency is only eight years which is an incredibly short time to try to have a real and lasting and long-term impact on the way American government works and you know when you when you consider the brown the decision was in 1954 desegregating schools and in 1975 in Boston Massachusetts in a federal court they are fighting the the segregation of Boston schools yeah would Thurgood Marshall who argued that case in 1954 say geez maybe I was oh that's that's the way progress steps along yeah and I think one of the things I don't agree with it when people say that the Trump is wiping away President Obama's legacy you know Tiffany you mentioned one way his legacy is lasting it took a while for this whole Obama alumni crop of alums to start running for office but in other ways even things like the Iran deal the principle underlying it the deal that was made Trump can undo it but then look at the ripple effects into North Korea right think the Cuba policy new Obamacare it's turning out be quite difficult to undo it and people don't want to take anyway so he has this sort of really incredible legacy but even on race he forced us to confront some things that the backlash to it isn't even teaching us yeah I think one of the things that drove people crazy about President Obama was he was so sober and rational and and strategic and plotting and laying the foundation so that whatever decision is made is something that is as long-lasting as possible I remember the LGBT community was so angry with President Obama because he would not move as fast as they wanted what do an executive a lot right on marriage equality and his plan from the very beginning was I want to make sure that what happens is lasting right cannot be overturned by another by another president so with all of with all of these deals the Iran deal the thing that's fascinating is that even though President Trump has done away with it the rest of the world is hanging on to that deal and I think that says a lot that says a lot about the leadership and work of not just President Obama but the Obama administration to go into a negotiation like that with real goals yeah and with strength behind them and here we are on the precipice of a summit between President Trump and Kim jong-un and I don't know anyone around this table have any idea what's gonna happen at that at that meeting I mean president Trump has given the the leader of North Korea something that his father and grandfather couldn't get wouldn't get because no president of the United States would grant that person yeah the audience and yet here on the opening shot President Trump has given it to this guy the United States leadership in the world is crumbling before our very eyes and the man we just saw in that clip President President Obama in the days after president Trump's election was someone who's who was trying in the in the moment when the country was in deep grieving project strength yeah the American ideal and the American people and and the idea of America and in the year and year-and-a-half since then we are watching all around us how that's either being nibbled away at or had taken president Trump taking a sledgehammer to the idea of America yeah and not only that but making his own presidency derivative of Barack Obama's presidency yeah everything is in relation and reflection of the guy who came before much is a weird way to be president it's a very weird way to be president I'll let you comment on then that I'm gonna get the last word too long okay the second last word before to be the last so I think you know even Donald Trump will have his place in history right because I do think during the Obama administration I talked about this before that a lot of my family they were you know they didn't understand the difference between state and federal local government I had friends who didn't really understand and they were so excited about this president you know they'd say man you know we got President Obama in office and that pothole out on the corner it's got big but I think what President Trump has done if we can give him some credit for something is he has inspired people to pay attention to what is going on people are now more engaged than they were before and so you know we have to have a president Trump to get perhaps a president Cory Booker come out here you know yeah it was Lauren or whomever may come next Lauren so to the Obama quote about the 20 years I'm reminded of an old of Daniel Patrick Moynihan story when we were he was chairman of Finance Committee and I was running the staff of the committee and we had a nominee coming in to come down and work on welfare policy in the Clinton administration and it was a Harvard professor and we knew that to maintain his his tenure he could only do two years and then he'd go back to Harvard to hold on to his tenure and and and it makes sense for it's more than just holding onto tenure and at the end of that discussion you know and and this professor had high hopes for welfare policy in the Clinton administration as he was walking out the door senator Marty Huntsman baha well you know no sense getting involved in this if you're not going to stay at it for 30 years and that's the truth of anything that you pick up and try to do and try to move in American government and try to do it within your lifetime and career if you don't if you can't devote 30 years to it there are gonna be times when you feel like what are we doing here what happened did anything happen and so of course an eight-year presidency can leave a president at moment's wondering after the fact did we get where we needed to go and the end the answer is you got at best you got where you could go yeah in that very limited time they allowed you yeah and I and I I think that President Obama came along it just when he made it to and it's important that he was there Jonathan Capehart Tiffany cross Lawrence O'Donnell think you all have a really great weekend this is a great discussion coming up the use of force back in the spotlight hey
