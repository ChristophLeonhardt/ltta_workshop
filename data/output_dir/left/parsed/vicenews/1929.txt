hey I'm Neelu tabrizi I'm a journalist
here at vice news this week I'll be
joining on the line to discuss our peace
race to the bottom it's about the
California drought and we went all over
to see who's using the most water in the
worst drought to hit the state in 1,200
years California agriculture is a
powerhouse are the reason why we didn't
get groundwater legislation sooner was
that it there was a real resistance from
parts of the agricultural community so
if you want to join us and ask a
question you can hit us up on skype with
a video message or send us a tweet with
the hashtag on the line
