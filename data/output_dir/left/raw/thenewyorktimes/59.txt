1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,030
Bodybuilding.com is one of
the most popular fitness

2
00:00:03,030 --> 00:00:04,800
forums on the internet.

3
00:00:04,800 --> 00:00:07,530
And the most popular
profile on bodybuilding.com

4
00:00:07,530 --> 00:00:11,070
belongs to this Australian
bodybuilder called Zyzz.

5
00:00:11,070 --> 00:00:13,440
On the website’s
boards, his catchphrases

6
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:15,091
pulse through
the conversation.

7
00:00:15,091 --> 00:00:15,850
“You mirin’, brah?

8
00:00:15,850 --> 00:00:16,760
You mirin’, brah?

9
00:00:16,760 --> 00:00:18,205
You mirin’, brah?”

10
00:00:18,205 --> 00:00:21,340
On Facebook, hundreds of
fan pages pay tribute.

11
00:00:21,340 --> 00:00:24,470
And on YouTube, images
of him flexing and posing

12
00:00:24,470 --> 00:00:26,987
are remixed into epic
motivational clips.

13
00:00:26,987 --> 00:00:29,190
“And every one of us has a
little bit of Zyzz in us.

14
00:00:29,190 --> 00:00:30,715
You just don’t know it yet.”

15
00:00:30,715 --> 00:00:33,080
He’s also been dead
for seven years.

16
00:00:33,080 --> 00:00:36,760
He died in a sauna in Thailand
when he was 22 years old.

17
00:00:36,760 --> 00:00:40,840
Doctors said that he had an
undiagnosed heart condition.

18
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:44,835
But on the internet, he lives
on as meme and inspiration.

19
00:00:44,835 --> 00:00:47,806
“Zyzz really inspired me to
do gym and just to be myself.”

20
00:00:47,806 --> 00:00:49,121
“Zyzz got me
where I am today."

21
00:00:49,121 --> 00:00:50,496
“Bro, thanks for
the motivation.”

22
00:00:50,496 --> 00:00:50,976
“Thanks for the motivation.”

23
00:00:50,976 --> 00:00:51,790
“Thanks for the motivation.

24
00:00:51,790 --> 00:00:52,649
You’ve set the bar.

25
00:00:52,649 --> 00:00:54,065
That’s what
everyone’s aiming for.

26
00:00:54,065 --> 00:00:55,606
Everyone’s aiming
for your physique.”

27
00:00:55,606 --> 00:01:00,650
There are now nearly 300,000
YouTube videos about Zyzz.

28
00:01:00,650 --> 00:01:03,980
A new tribute is uploaded
every couple of hours.

29
00:01:03,980 --> 00:01:06,170
If Charles Atlas
was the bodybuilding king

30
00:01:06,170 --> 00:01:08,720
of the 1920s and
Arnold Schwarzenegger

31
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:11,950
was the prototypical
manly man of ‘80s movies,

32
00:01:11,950 --> 00:01:14,210
Zyzz represents the
quintessential man

33
00:01:14,210 --> 00:01:16,310
of the modern
fitness internet.

34
00:01:16,310 --> 00:01:18,290
He’s got one of the
most valuable assets

35
00:01:18,290 --> 00:01:20,260
for an online fitness star —

36
00:01:20,260 --> 00:01:24,230
an insane before-and-after
transformation photo set.

37
00:01:24,230 --> 00:01:27,140
In four years flat, he went
from awkward high schooler

38
00:01:27,140 --> 00:01:28,730
to Myspace Ken doll —

39
00:01:28,730 --> 00:01:33,395
6 foot 1, 205
pounds, 8% body fat.

40
00:01:33,395 --> 00:01:34,565
“Oh!"

41
00:01:34,565 --> 00:01:36,290
A lot of diet and
workout trends

42
00:01:36,290 --> 00:01:38,360
pretend that they’re about
improving your health

43
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:39,090
and wellness.

44
00:01:39,090 --> 00:01:40,415
“And feel great!"

45
00:01:40,415 --> 00:01:43,830
But Zyzz popularized a laser
focus on what he called

46
00:01:43,830 --> 00:01:45,050
‘aesthetics.'

47
00:01:45,050 --> 00:01:47,870
His persona was never about
lifting the heaviest weights

48
00:01:47,870 --> 00:01:50,810
or running the fastest mile
or eating the most nutritious

49
00:01:50,810 --> 00:01:51,890
meals.

50
00:01:51,890 --> 00:01:55,640
It was about achieving the
craziest physique possible.

51
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:58,160
He pursued it until
he literally died.

52
00:01:58,160 --> 00:02:00,640
But a lot of other men
are still chasing it, too.

53
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:04,130
"(SINGING) We’re talking ‘bout
the language of exercise!"

54
00:02:04,130 --> 00:02:06,580
Women have always had
a version of this.

55
00:02:06,580 --> 00:02:09,590
They’re expected to idealize
certain aspirational female

56
00:02:09,590 --> 00:02:12,080
forms and to build
communities around whittling

57
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:13,798
their own bodies
in their image.

58
00:02:13,798 --> 00:02:14,885
"(SINGING) [inaudible]"

59
00:02:14,885 --> 00:02:17,000
And keeping up
appearances has long been

60
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,737
a reality for gay men, too.

61
00:02:18,737 --> 00:02:21,350
“Come to Man’s Country
and develop your body —

62
00:02:21,350 --> 00:02:23,780
or a friendship with
somebody else’s."

63
00:02:23,780 --> 00:02:26,540
But this space, built for
straight men to measure,

64
00:02:26,540 --> 00:02:29,490
quantify, objectify,
and straight-up admire —

65
00:02:29,490 --> 00:02:34,150
sorry, ‘mire’ — each other’s
bodies, that feels new.

66
00:02:34,150 --> 00:02:37,779
Zyzz made the male-on-male
gaze explicit.

67
00:02:37,779 --> 00:02:40,070
It’s interesting that even
as men and women have become

68
00:02:40,070 --> 00:02:42,860
more equal in a lot of
ways, idealized images

69
00:02:42,860 --> 00:02:44,810
of their bodies are
moving more and more

70
00:02:44,810 --> 00:02:46,790
toward gendered extremes.

71
00:02:46,790 --> 00:02:48,620
Psychologists
suggest that as men

72
00:02:48,620 --> 00:02:50,900
lose status and social
power over women,

73
00:02:50,900 --> 00:02:54,020
they’re driven to assert
their masculinity physically —

74
00:02:54,020 --> 00:02:56,210
to strive to look
like real men

75
00:02:56,210 --> 00:02:58,460
even if they don’t
always feel like them.

76
00:02:58,460 --> 00:03:01,430
And on the internet, whole
new vocabularies and image

77
00:03:01,430 --> 00:03:04,730
references are forming to
help men express themselves

78
00:03:04,730 --> 00:03:06,320
in this new mode.

79
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:08,900
Here, everything
is quantified.

80
00:03:08,900 --> 00:03:12,620
Life is a series of stats
and reps and rankings.

81
00:03:12,620 --> 00:03:14,930
It’s not cooking,
it’s meal prep.

82
00:03:14,930 --> 00:03:17,000
It’s not food, it’s intake.

83
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:20,420
And it’s not breakfast,
it’s meal one.

84
00:03:20,420 --> 00:03:22,730
The male body is converted
into a math problem

85
00:03:22,730 --> 00:03:24,320
to be solved.

86
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:26,679
All of this can
be totally fine.

87
00:03:26,679 --> 00:03:28,220
But when you take
the quantified self

88
00:03:28,220 --> 00:03:31,610
to its extreme conclusion,
you find a hellscape

89
00:03:31,610 --> 00:03:33,650
of objectification.

90
00:03:33,650 --> 00:03:35,330
Every type of guy
can be slotted

91
00:03:35,330 --> 00:03:38,270
into his own
dehumanizing category —

92
00:03:38,270 --> 00:03:42,650
virgins, Chads,
soy boys, cucks.

93
00:03:42,650 --> 00:03:46,040
A man’s stats
determine his status.

94
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:49,460
Online fitness culture offers
men a powerful illusion

95
00:03:49,460 --> 00:03:50,600
of control —

96
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:53,000
over their own bodies
and over other people’s,

97
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,240
too, because on
bodybuilding.com, guys don’t

98
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:57,980
just talk about fitness.

99
00:03:57,980 --> 00:04:00,740
They talk about
relationships and politics.

100
00:04:00,740 --> 00:04:03,710
And those are easily filtered
through this adolescent human

101
00:04:03,710 --> 00:04:05,380
ranking system, too.

102
00:04:05,380 --> 00:04:08,000
In these forums,
humanity itself

103
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,920
is reduced to a hierarchy.

104
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:13,150
And the same ruthless logic
that lures men to the fitness

105
00:04:13,150 --> 00:04:15,980
internet — that getting
shredded will give you access

106
00:04:15,980 --> 00:04:18,200
to some elusive
male dominance —

107
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:20,240
is also easily
exploited by people

108
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:21,779
on the political fringe.

109
00:04:21,779 --> 00:04:23,740
“They don’t want
men being men.

110
00:04:23,740 --> 00:04:27,650
That’s why Infowars has
developed Anthroplex."

111
00:04:27,650 --> 00:04:28,350
“Zyzz!

112
00:04:28,350 --> 00:04:28,850
Zyzz!

113
00:04:28,850 --> 00:04:29,350
Zyzz!

114
00:04:29,350 --> 00:04:29,945
Zyzz!"

115
00:04:29,945 --> 00:04:32,885
Many of Zyzz’s followers
will never achieve his body.

116
00:04:32,885 --> 00:04:35,195
“And you’ve got a
genuinely sick [inaudible]..

117
00:04:35,195 --> 00:04:36,740
I do not give a [bleep] — "

118
00:04:36,740 --> 00:04:38,731
But they’ve absorbed
his ideology.

119
00:04:38,731 --> 00:04:41,640
“Well, Zyzz, he told me
that life’s way better when

120
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:43,610
you’re aesthetic as [bleep]."

121
00:04:43,610 --> 00:04:46,040
If the dawn of the social
web fanned fears about young

122
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:48,950
girls falling prey to
pro-anorexia sites where they

123
00:04:48,950 --> 00:04:51,470
were instructed how
to starve themselves,

124
00:04:51,470 --> 00:04:53,990
we’re just beginning to
realize how these online

125
00:04:53,990 --> 00:04:56,930
communities built around
male body goals can be

126
00:04:56,930 --> 00:04:59,340
destructive, too —

127
00:04:59,340 --> 00:05:04,910
not just for the men
themselves but for all of us.

128
00:05:04,910 --> 00:05:06,080
Hey, this is Amanda.

129
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:06,980
This is Shane.

130
00:05:06,980 --> 00:05:07,891
He edits the videos.

131
00:05:07,891 --> 00:05:09,241
She writes the videos.

132
00:05:09,241 --> 00:05:10,441
You watch the videos.

133
00:05:10,441 --> 00:05:11,551
And if you like the videos,

134
00:05:11,551 --> 00:05:13,241
like, comment and 
subscribe here.

135
00:05:13,241 --> 00:05:15,721
And then tell us,
where do you see masculinity

136
00:05:15,721 --> 00:05:17,101
in crisis?

137
00:05:17,101 --> 00:05:18,091
In the mirror

138
00:05:18,091 --> 00:05:19,381
Leave your answer in the
comments.

139
00:05:19,381 --> 00:05:21,951
We are very thirsty.

140
00:05:21,951 --> 00:00:00,000
[singing] “Internetting with
Amanda Hess.”
