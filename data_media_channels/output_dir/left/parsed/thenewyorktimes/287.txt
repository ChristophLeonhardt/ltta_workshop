When you draw, there
is no stolen moment,
no snap of a shutter.
You really take the time to
see what’s in front of you.
As a reportage illustrator,
I find myself drawing
people who are on the move.
Around the world,
huge numbers of people
are uprooting themselves and
traveling great distances,
whether to flee from
danger or to find work.
I’m in Tajikistan to explore
one of the world’s largest migrations.
It’s not to sensationalize it.
It’s not to exaggerate
the reasons for doing it,
but it’s trying to pick
the most common experience.
Twice a week, a train
packed with migrants
leaves Dushanbe, the
capital of Tajikistan,
and traverses the
whole of Central Asia
through Ukbekistan,
Turkmenistan, Kazakhstan,
and into Russia before
arriving in Moscow.
It takes four days.
It’s an extraordinary commute
just for the prospect of work.
Oyat and Abdullo are two young
men from rural Tajikistan.
I wanted to capture
their stories
with an intimacy we seldom see.
Drawing allows me to
witness the issues
surrounding their friendship:
of breaking tradition,
of leaving family behind
and of growing up.
But their future is uncertain.
At times, more than 50%
of the Tajik economy
relies on money sent home.
But that crucial source of
support has been drying up.
How do you choose between two
equally unattractive options —
to stay at home without work or
to go to Russia without family?
Oyat stays and Abdullo
decides to leave.
This will be his
fourth trip to Russia.
He leaves behind his wife
and his six-month-old baby.
And the conditions on the train
were a sign of things to come.
The border guards
bully the migrants.
They go through their bags.
They go through our bags,
and they systematically
pull apart the train,
all on the off chance
that they might find drugs.
The young men are often
intimidated by police dogs
and deprived of sleep.
The train pulls into
Moscow in the early hours,
and they arrive exhausted.
Abdullo and the
other migrants spend
the night in the
freezing station
huddled together,
waiting for the metro
to open the next morning.
As they move about
Moscow, there’s
consistent pressure
from the authorities.
It’s something I noticed
trying to draw in the metro.
Often, a policeman would come
and look over your shoulder
to see what you were doing.
And each person who looked like
they were from Central Asia
was being stopped, and
their papers were checked.
And if they don’t have
the right paperwork,
then it’s the beginning
of trouble for them —
fines, visa complications,
and deportation.
We traveled to the
outskirts of Moscow
with Abdullo as he
began looking for work.
The workers here live
together in the apartments
they are refurbishing.
Once they finish one,
they move on to the next.
If they are lucky,
they make $500 a month.
In Tajikistan,
they were together
and enjoying themselves.
Here, they are together,
but trying to survive.
It’s the process of drawing
that allows me enough time
to understand the resilience
and the extraordinary bond
that the migrants have here.
These are just a group of men
trying to make their own way,
and their relationship to
the Russian authorities
is a very difficult one.
In Abdullo’s case,
it was about trying
to avoid an overwhelming feeling
of being helpless at home.
It was about him making
a positive choice
to stay in control of his life.
We’re beginning to
experience change
to borders all over the world —
in the United
States, in Europe
and in this case, in Russia.
But what will the future
hold for the next generation,
and how should governments
police their borders?
Perhaps if we showed not the
most shocking, but the most
common experience
of migration,
we would be
less intimidated by it.
