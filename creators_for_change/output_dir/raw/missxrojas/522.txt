00:01:37,020 --> 00:01:39,630
just being in London again I'm really

42
00:01:39,630 --> 00:01:41,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">looking forward to it but Claire's been</font>

43
00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:43,439
a bit tough<font color="#CCCCCC"> recently especially as I say</font>

44
00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:45,509
with formspring as a distraction and

45
00:01:45,509 --> 00:01:48,540
just watching so many videos like today

46
00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:49,500
for example i started watching

47
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:52,229
flashforward which I've never seen<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I</font>

48
00:01:52,229 --> 00:01:53,840
really do it kinda like a mix between

49
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:56,700
lost and heroes one of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> questions I</font>

50
00:01:56,700 --> 00:01:57,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">was getting a lot on formspring was</font>

51
00:01:57,960 --> 00:02:00,180
whether<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'd read in the thing good</font>

52
00:02:00,180 --> 00:02:02,310
recently<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with like the books</font>

53
00:02:02,310 --> 00:02:05,100
of my core so really good but once you

54
00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:06,719
do that<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then doing the background</font>

55
00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:09,449
reading of articles and books to kind of

56
00:02:09,449 --> 00:02:11,220
contextualise that then

57
00:02:11,220 --> 00:02:14,730
it's sort of tricky to kind of have time

58
00:02:14,730 --> 00:02:17,490
to read much apart from<font color="#CCCCCC"> that so there's</font>

59
00:02:17,490 --> 00:02:19,410
a nice list of books<font color="#E5E5E5"> that i want to read</font>

60
00:02:19,410 --> 00:02:21,210
over<font color="#E5E5E5"> Christmas whether or not I'll</font>

61
00:02:21,210 --> 00:02:22,920

62
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:25,020
matter but he knows one thing I want to

63
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:26,550

66
00:02:32,070 --> 00:02:33,960
Christmas food I used to be very big on

67
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:36,450

68
00:02:36,450 --> 00:02:37,740
blanket and that's what your<font color="#CCCCCC"> things so</font>

69
