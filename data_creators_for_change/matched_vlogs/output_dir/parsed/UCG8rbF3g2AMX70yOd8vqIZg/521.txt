stealing your food so I told you guys I
had a free day off
and because of that reason I'm like yo
let's do something fun so today since my
life is super exciting we are gonna do
something really fun so the first item
on the agenda is I'm gonna test
different flavors of peanut butter on
sticks of celery Wow so sick but there's
a twist
I got raises baby we make you put peanut
butter on sticks of celery you put
raisins on them looks like ants on a log
it's very self-explanatory and delicious
I don't really have a choice
in doing this and Mexican jumping my
breakfast this morning and now I'm left
with this so let's get started shall we
there's what works working with
we got better peanut butter I'm not even
sure of his peanut butter Iraq and lie
to you but apparently it's better
dude this is yeah not even peanut butter
almond butter okay and three okay I
didn't do my research I just got almond
butter or whatever the rip up one stick
of celery ripoff two sticks of celery
we got one stick of celery for each
peanut bar but this is the most exciting
of all day bro bro I'm looking at these
and I'm seeing the consistency is a bit
different for each one
it's our mix enough give a nice little
slush mess Oh the thing about almond
butter is that I notice it's a bit more
the liquidity is higher than peanut
butter let's give this first one ago huh
what do you say folks let's start
spreading something I'm a pretend I'm a
pretend it's gonna be a nice it's gonna
be nice cut ready okay here we go with
the almond butter let's do it
what okay cool we arranged this camera
who cares
that means goodnight in espanol I'm
gonna go ahead and spread these and
we're gonna do a nice little speed
time-lapse thing and then we're gonna
cut to uh the final product before we
put the ants on the law time to put
these ants on a log
I'm telling you in my life cannot get
more exciting than right now I'm at the
peak of my career I'm so happy
let's put the ants on the law gonna test
these out one by one give a little bite
and then uh I know you guys waiting for
woods which peanut butter to the bus so
