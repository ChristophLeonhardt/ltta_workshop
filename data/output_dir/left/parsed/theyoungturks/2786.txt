A UNIVERSITY IN FLORIDA
HAS A CLASS THAT UNFORTUNATELY
NEEDS TO BE GUARDED BY POLICE
BECAUSE OF THE TOPIC THAT IS
COVERED IN THAT CLASS.
IT IS TITLED WHITE RACISM AND IT
IS AT FLORIDA GULF UNIVERSITY.
THE FIRST CLASS HAD TWO
POLICE GUARDS GUARDING IT
BECAUSE OF THREATS THAT WERE
MADE TOWARD TED THORNHILL WHICH
IS THE PROFESSOR TEACHING THE
SOCIOLOGY COURSE.
SOME OF THE 
THREATS THAT THE
PROFESSOR RECEIVED INCLUDED THE
STANDARD DEATH THREATS WHICH
MOST PUBLIC FIGURES EXPERIENCE
AT SOME POINT, BUT ALSO SOME
COMMENTS INCLUDING 
THE
FOLLOWING:
NO IRONY THERE AT ALL, GIVE HIM
A RACIST NAME AND THEN CALL
HIM RACIST.
THAT WENT RIGHT OVER HIS HEAD.
THIS NEXT ONE APPEARS TO BE SENT
BY DONALD TRUMP BECAUSE OF
THE USE OF CAPS BUT PROBABLY
NOT.
IT SAYS:
OF COURSE THEY CALLED A SUBHUMAN
MONGREL WHILE SAYING HOW DARE
YOU SAY THERE IS WHITE RACISM.
EVERY ONE OF THOSE MISSED THE
CONCEPT OF IRONY.
NOW LET'S BREAK IT DOWN.
HAS THERE BEEN WHITE DOMINANCE
SUPREMACY AND RACISM IN
THIS COUNTRY FOR HUNDREDS OF
YEARS?
NO, NEVER.
IS THIS A DEBATE?
LOOK, WHEN THEY TALK ABOUT THE
HISTORY OF RACISM IN THIS
COUNTRY, IT DOES NOT MEAN THAT
HE IS CALLING YOU RACIST.
HE DOES NOT KNOW YOU.
YOU TAKE IT SO PERSONALLY AND IT
MAKES ME WONDER WHAT IT IS
THAT MAKES YOU DO THAT.
ANA IS LITERALLY CAUCASIAN, DO
YOU TAKE IT PERSONALLY?
I DON'T.
NOT ONLY DO I LOOK WHITE,
ARMENIANS ARE FROM THE CAUCUS.
FOR ME, THIS CLASS IS NO
DIFFERENT FROM ANY OTHER
SOCIOLOGY CLASS HAS BEEN TAUGHT
IN REGARD TO RACE RELATIONS
IN THE UNITED STATES.
THE THING THAT TRIGGERED PEOPLE
WAS THE TITLE OF THE CLASS,
WHITE RACISM.
IF YOU GET TRIGGERED BY THAT,
THEN THERE IS SOME SORT OF
GUILT EITHER SUBCONSCIOUSLY OR
VERY CONSCIOUSLY BEGINNING
TO DEAL WITH BECAUSE WHEN I HEAR
ABOUT THIS CLASS, I DO NOT
THINK OH MY GOD, THIS GUYS
CALLING YOU RACIST, HOW DARE HE.
I DO GO, WE ARE GOING TO GO
THROUGH HAPPENED
HISTORICALLY IN THE UNITED
STATES AND WHAT IS
CURRENTLY HAPPENING TODAY WHICH
MAYBE TWO YEARS AGO I WOULD
SAY ISN'T SO OVERT BUT LATELY IT
HAS BEEN.
LET'S CONTINUE.
WHITE RACISM.
DOES THAT MEAN IF YOU ARE
TEACHING A CLASS ON WHITE
RACISM THAT THAT IS THE ONLY
RACISM THAT EXISTS AND THAT
IS WHAT THE PROFESSOR THINKS?
NO, HE NEVER SAID THAT.
COULD
THERE BE BLACK RACISM, ASIAN
RACISM?
OF COURSE.
DO YOU KNOW HOW OLD RACISM IS?
ALMOST EVERYBODY THINKS THAT
EVERYONE ELSE IS LESS THAN THEM.
IN JAMAICA, YOU COULD HAVE A
CLASS ON BLACK RACISM AGAINST
ASIANS.
WHEN I WAS THERE ABOUT A DECADE
AGO, AND I DO NOT KNOW IF IT HAS
CHANGED SINCE THEN, BUT
MOST EVERY ASIAN PERSON AND
THERE WERE PLENTY AND JAMAICA
ARE CALLED MR.
CHEN AND MISS
CHEN AND I HAVE FRIENDS WHO ARE
ASIAN AND JAMAICAN AND THEY
DO NOT APPRECIATE IT.
IF YOU ARE DOING THE CLASS IN
JAMAICA, YOU WOULD DO ONE
ON BLACK RACISM, AND CHINA, YOU
MIGHT DO IT ON CHINESE RACISM.
BUT IN AMERICA, WHAT IS THE
PRIMARY FORM OF RACISM?
CORSET IS WHITE RACISM.
I TALKED ABOUT IN A RECENT
OLD-SCHOOL, MEMBERS ALWAYS GET
IT, TYTNETWORK.COM/JOIN BUT IT
IS NOW IN ITUNES THAT WE JUST
DID IT WITH JAYAR AND MALCOLM IN
THE LAST EPISODE BUT REAL QUICK
HERE, TURKS IN GERMANY ARE THE
MINORITY AND THEY ARE
TREATED LIKE AFRICAN-AMERICANS
ARE TREATED HERE IN AMERICA
SO IF YOU DID A CLASS ON GERMAN
RACISM AGAINST TURKS IN
GERMANY THAT MIGHT MAKE SENSE.
TURKESTAN RACISM AGAINST GERMAN
I'M SURE EXISTS BUT IT IS
NOT THEIR PREDOMINANT ISSUE IN
GERMANY.
ON THE OTHER HAND, IF YOU ARE IN
TURKEY WHERE THE TURKS OF THE
MAJORITY THEN A CLASS ON TURKISH
RACISM MAKES ALL THE SENSE IN
THE WORLD WHEREAS CLASS ON A
MARTY AND RACISM AGAINST
TURKS IN TURKEY MAKES NO SENSE
BECAUSE TURKS ARE THE
MAJORITY IN TURKEY.
THESE ARE SIMPLE CONCEPTS
BUT YOU DON'T CARE TO
UNDERSTAND THEM IF YOU THINK
KNOW, THERE'S NO SUCH THING
AS RACISM, WHY WON'T BLACK
PEOPLE KNOW WHAT THEIR ROLE AS?
FOR ME, THIS GOES BEYOND THE
SPECIFIC TOPIC OF RACISM.
THIS GOES TOWARD A BROADER
TOPIC THAT'S BEEN ONGOING
REGARDING COLLEGE CAMPUSES AND
FREE SPEECH.
FOR ME IT IS IMPORTANT TO ALLOW
VARIOUS PERSPECTIVES TO BE
REPRESENTED ON A COLLEGE CAMPUS
EVEN IF IT IS A PERSPECTIVE THAT
YOU DISAGREE WITH BECAUSE YOU
ARE SUPPOSED TO BE IN AN
ENVIRONMENT THAT CHALLENGES YOUR
PRECONCEIVED NOTIONS AND SO WHEN
YOU HAVE THE BEEN SCHAPIRO'S GO
ON TO THE BERKELEY CAMPUS TO
GIVE A SPEECH, I DON'T LIKE THE
PEOPLE TRY TO STOP THAT
SPEECH FROM HAPPENING, EVEN IF
YOU DISLIKE HIM OR DISAGREE
WITH HIS IDEOLOGY, I THINK THAT
THERE IS VALUE IN HEARING
WHAT HE HAS TO SAY.
I LISTEN TO HIS PODCAST TIME TO
TIME, NOT BECAUSE I'M A FAN OF
HIS, BECAUSE WHO KNOWS, MAYBE
THERE'S SOMETHING HE IS RIGHT
ABOUT THAT I AM RIGHT ABOUT.
YOU ARE OPEN-MINDED THAT
HERE'S THE THING, I THINK
THAT WE AS HUMANS, IT'S A
HUMAN INSTINCT THAT WE ALL
KIND OF REVERT BACK TO HER
COMFORT ZONE AND WE REMAIN IN
OUR LITTLE IDEOLOGICAL
BUBBLES AND I WANT TO BE
CHALLENGED.
EVERY ONCE IN A WHILE I WOULD
HEAR AN ARGUMENT ON THE
OTHER SIDE THAT I THINK IS
VALUABLE AND IT WILL MAKE
ME DO A LITTLE MORE
INVESTIGATING.
THAT IS A GOOD THING.
I WANT COLLEGE STUDENTS TO STOP
TRYING TO BE CAUGHT OLD.
I KNOW THAT IS GOING TO OFFEND A
LOT OF PEOPLE, BUT ONCE YOU
ARE OUT OF COLLEGE AND YOU ARE
IN THE REAL WORLD, IT GETS REAL.
THERE IS NO ONE TO CALL YOU OR
TO CARESS YOUR BEHIND AND
TELL YOU IT IS GOING TO BE OKAY.
LIFE SUCKS AND YOU ARE GOING TO
BE DEALING WITH A LOT OF
PRETTY TERRIBLE PEOPLE.
IT IS BETTER IF YOU WANT TO GET
OUT OF YOUR COMFORT ZONE
AND DEAL WITH IDEAS THAT MAKE
YOU UNCOMFORTABLE THEN TO
EXPECT PEOPLE TO JUST AGREE WITH
YOU ALL THE TIME.
TWO THINGS ABOUT THAT, ONE, I
AM A GREAT EXAMPLE OF THAT
BECAUSE I WAS A REPUBLICAN BUT I
WAS OPEN-MINDED ENOUGH TO START
LISTENING TO THE OTHER SIDE AND
THEN EVENTUALLY I WAS LIKE THAT
POSITION IS TRUE AND BY THE WAY,
HISTORY SHOWED THAT REPUBLICANS
DO NOT BALANCE THE BUDGETS,
THINGS ALONG THOSE LINES
AND PEACE THEIR STRENGTH DIDN'T
MEAN PEACE, ADMIT ENDLESS WAR.
KEEP AN OPEN MIND AND WHAT AND I
SAYING APPLIES TO BOTH SIDES,
LIBERALS AND CONSERVATIVES ON
COLLEGE CAMPUSES.
KIDDING ASIDE, GOING TO HEAR A
CONSERVATIVE SPEAKER, I
HEARD JESSE JACKSON WHEN I WAS A
REPUBLICAN AT COLLEGE AND I
WALKED OUT GOING, THAT WAS
SURPRISING.
THAT WAS PRETTY GOOD.
HE MADE A BUNCH OF GOOD POINTS.
AND THEN I WENT TO LISTEN TO
FARRAKHAN AND THE FIRST HALF
OF THE SPEECH WAS ABOUT PERSONAL
RESPONSIBILITY AND I LIKED THAT.
THE SECOND HALF WAS ABOUT HOW
THE JEWS OF THE WORST AND I
WAS LIKE WHAT?
I HATE THAT.
YOU GO AND LISTEN, DOESN'T MEAN
YOU AGREE, IT MEANS TO KEEP AN
OPEN MIND AND FOR CONSERVATIVES,
CAN YOU STOP BEING
SNOWFLAKES FOR A SECOND.
YOU GET TRIGGERED BY, JUST
BECAUSE THEY ADDED THE WORD
RIGHT IN FRONT OF RACISM.
WHAT IS THE PREDOMINANT FORM OF
RACISM IN THE MEXICAN AMERICA?
YOU KNOW THERE WAS SLAVERY AND
OTHER COUNTRIES IN THE WORLD.
OF COURSE YOU DO, UNLIKE YOU WE
DON'T CELEBRATE IGNORANCE.
THERE WAS SLAVERY ALL ACROSS THE
WORLD, BUT IN AMERICA, IT
WAS PREDOMINANTLY WHITE PEOPLE
WHO HAD BLACK SLAVES.
FOR YOU TO DENY THAT IS ABSURD
AND IS DEFENSIVE IN A WAY
THAT MAKES YOU THINK, WHAT ARE
YOU TRYING TO HIDE?
I DON'T KNOW WHY YOU WOULD NEED
TO SAVE SPACE FROM THIS
VERY OBVIOUS CLASS.
JUST LET IT GO AND HAVE AN OPEN
MIND FOR 
A SECOND, BOTH SIDES.
