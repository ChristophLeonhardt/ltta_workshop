I want you to close your eyes for a minute and imagine confessing microaggressions you've committed and not just as some pathetic progressive self flagellation routine on Twitter but as a 22-page academic essay all right now open them because you don't need to just imagine that anymore strap yourselves in lads because it's a crazy ride ahead meet California State University Monterey Bay student Erica a Perez Montes who is queer and part of the Latin X community which if you're confused is how these nuts say Latino in a gender inclusive fashion so I was just minding my own business browsing the internet yesterday when I ran into Erica's senior capstone project on microaggressions in the lgbtq+ community the abstract says this Auto ethnography is about different points in my life where I committed microaggressions towards the lgbtq+ community specific to different genders sexual orientations and/or how people in the community present themselves now Erica is apparently majoring in human communication which I would hope she's been learning her whole life I mean that's kind of like saying I'm majoring in eating food or breathing air in the project proposal she says my expectations are to identify artifacts were you mean where that's not the only time she makes that mistake by the way where I have committed microaggressions in the lgbtq+ community this would include Facebook posts past memories and experiences I will also be journaling yeah that's not really a word to reflect on these artifacts and why it was why they were Erica a microaggression towards the lgbtq+ community so as though that's her microaggression weren't enough by itself Erica so helpfully divides it into three categories micro invalidations micro insults and micro assaults I'm guessing her paper would be a macro assault on all of our intelligences so for our first micro aggression she apparently took a picture of her friend's goofy smile and put it on Facebook with the cat haha look at this faggots weird-ass smile she says at the time I did not think anything of it I can also recall that I said the word faggot a lot as a term of endearment even though now I don't think there's anything endearing about it a lot of my friends at the time said that word and somehow I adopted it I can't say that word without doing a big gulp before I say it or even type it now Erica proceeds to confess that she assigned a gender to a drag queen and unfairly made distinctions between gay and to gay and you know okay that's great to hear Erica but I'm not your friend and I'm not your priest this is like me writing an academic paper on how I a schizophrenic only flicked the light switch on and off 19 times before bed instead of 20 times I'm someone who wants to learn something from your work something other than your missteps in being nice to others or adhering to a paranoid leftist Dogma for campus unmasked I'm Rob commercial if you like this video and support our mission please make sure to comment and subscribe if something happens on your campus and you'd like us to investigate send us details using the forum on campus on mass comm
