so there was a resolution in the United Nations to call for an investigation of what happened in Gaza as the massacre unfolded there over the last couple of days and and over a longer stretch of time as the week's went on in that protest near the border and of course the United States blocked it our ambassador nikki Haley spoke out and said this no country in this chamber would act with more restraint then Israel has in fact the records of several countries here today suggest they would be much less restrained nobody's been as restrained as Israel really you couldn't show more restraint according to the United Nations they were shooting and executing people that were 700 yards away from the so-called border 700 years away eight children were killed men women and children 60 dead 2400 wounded but you couldn't show more restraint it was not possible to show more extreme I mean you must have it is such moral danger if I'm probably more Israelis died right nope how many Israelis die none how many were wounded none how many of the soldiers were wounded none how many were in imminent danger none but nope we couldn't show any more restraint as Israeli human rights groups explained the Israeli government and military had weeks to prepare for these these protests have been going on for six weeks and and bless their hearts those human rights groups within Israel that's the left wing of Israel saying yeah we could have been more restrained they don't want Israel overrun their Israelis their families live in Israel they live in Israel and they don't want to just give away Israel s preposterous that's the real right wing talking points that our government is Rayleigh right wing government says oh my god if we didn't murder all those people well then the only other choices we would have had to give Israel to Hamas preposterous and initially says there's a couple of countries in here that were less restrained in their life well that's true for example our other great Ally Saudi Arabia they're even worse in Yemen that's right so wait they are also our top ally and by the way they're also Israel's ally I would love to restrain Saudi Arabia and the massacres that they have committed in Yemen we were not very restrained in Iraq so and sometimes Russia is not restrained Syria is not restrained I would love to restrain them as well let's be even-handed but to say that just what somehow Panama and Botswana are worse than Israel what the hell do they do it's preposterous all right by the way what it was it that they voted down and quote independent and transparent investigation wait if you were really restrained and you're the good guys why wouldn't you want an independent and transparent investigation it would clear you wouldn't it oh maybe you weren't the most restrained and maybe you did commit massacres and that's why you don't want a transparent investigation Raj Shah White House deputy press secretary yesterday said the responsibility for these tragic death rests squarely with Hamas Hamas is intentionally and cynically provoking this response well then why was that yeah I was so stupid as to get tricked by Hamas and give in to their provocation is that you know so weak so moronic that when Hamas provokes him he goes okay I'll give you what you want I don't think so and I'd love to ask that question of Rajesh I'd love to have reporters asking that question well if this was a propaganda effort by Hamas why did Israel fall right into their trap are they totally incompetent should they be voted out of office if this right-wing government Falls for every Hamas trap no the reality is of course that's not what happened it was a protest and the right-wing government decided to tell the soldiers to fire and they did follow orders and they did fire and those people did die and it was not because they had it coming it was because the right wing government of Israel profits from war that is a distraction for Netanyahu their whole platform has been a guest peace negotiations and in reality in and in practice for all of these decades they don't want peace that's why they do these conflicts and in this case a massacre and then if you were proud you you would then boldly present those things wouldn't you well here's another curious note I'm on yield and reporting for NBC says Wow Jared Kushner's controversial comment about Gaza during the embassy opening saying quote as we have seen from the protests of the last month and even today those provoking violence are part of the problem not part of the solution was omitted from the official White House transcript now why would you omit it from the transcript if you're not embarrassed about those comments I know what the right-wing in America thinks all your fake news I bet he didn't really say that really well here's a tape of Jared Kushner saying exactly that as we have seen from the protests of the last month and even today those provoking violence are part of the problem and not part of the solution that exact quote was omitted from the official transcript that is literally political correctness that's Orwellian and the reason it's emitted is cuz it's a little embarrassing now even some of the media in America are saying Jared Kushner and Ivanka sitting there celebrating and smiling and then blaming the victims as the rest of the world recognizes this for what it was seemed unseemly so they just removed it from the record and now it no longer exists that is an admission on their part that yes it did not look good to be celebrating as not Hamas not the Palestinian civilians but Israel took those actions they fired those bullets and and that's exactly why those people died and were wounded and it is obvious to the rest of the world and the rest of the decent people who care about lives on both sides two easy ways for Young Turks want us hit the subscribe button down below then you're a TYT subscriber and
