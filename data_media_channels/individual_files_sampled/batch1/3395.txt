I'm congressman Tim Ryan from Ohio yeah I think the FCC decision on net neutrality is going to damage the Internet as we know it today I think the Internet's going to start looking a lot more like cable television what it does is it gives a tremendous amount of power to the Internet service providers which is going to allow them to basically have different toll roads for other web sites and people who are providing content so they'll be a fast lane for certain ones and if there's a fast lane there has to be a slow lane so they're gonna determine who gets into the fast lane and who is gonna be relegated to the slow lane or doesn't get any access at all and the real problem here is that the Internet service providers are also doing content so they will give themselves favorable treatment as to they get in the fast lane with their content and so it's moving a concentration of information and power on the internet now and I think it's gonna be damaging to innovation and smaller businesses like Etsy and others who want to be able to compete on a level playing field that's why we have to keep an open Internet I think then that neutrality move by the FCC and the Trump administration is pretty consistent with their governing philosophy in the last year if you look at what's going on with tax reform it's it's moving money and power and influence to a very small concentrated group of the wealthiest people in the country if you look at what they're doing with net neutrality it's the same thing they're giving all of the power to the corporation's right now in moving it away from the people and I think it's a general governing philosophy does go against everything that he campaigned on because he campaigned on being the blue collar billionaire and he was gonna be the person who was gonna take on these these very very powerful interests and so their philosophy is we're going to take care of the people who are in the boardrooms unfortunately and not the working-class people that he campaigned on so not much left of the blue-collar billionaire anymore I think the lawsuits are helpful but at the end of the day the president has the power the FCC has the power and so we've got to make sure that in the next year or two we go out to the polls and we support candidates against people who have supported what the FCC did with net neutrality and hold those legislators accountable who support this kind of thing and we can move towards overturning it
