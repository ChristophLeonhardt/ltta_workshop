1
00:00:02,280 --> 00:00:03,160
The Me Too movement.

2
00:00:03,160 --> 00:00:03,760
Me Too Movement

3
00:00:03,760 --> 00:00:04,800
The Me Too Movement

4
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:08,240
What is a non-verbal cue?

5
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:10,920
They are just so fucking fragile.

6
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:12,480
Where is the line now?

7
00:00:25,540 --> 00:00:27,140
No. Not really, no

8
00:00:27,140 --> 00:00:27,680
Not really.

9
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:28,800
Never in the workplace.

10
00:00:28,820 --> 00:00:30,660
Weeellll... yes...

11
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:32,300
I've never been harassed at work.

12
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:33,720
Not directly.

13
00:00:33,720 --> 00:00:34,900
Of course, yeah.

14
00:00:34,900 --> 00:00:37,720
No, because I had my stand.

15
00:00:37,720 --> 00:00:40,760
I did my internship and one man
approached me and I said

16
00:00:40,760 --> 00:00:43,440
"only time I'm gonna touch your penis is to put it in the syringe."

17
00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:48,020
Yes he approached me.

18
00:00:48,020 --> 00:00:51,420
He approached me, he
took his penis out and asked me to hold it.

19
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:57,120
Between 60 and 70% of women don't report sexual harassment,

20
00:00:57,140 --> 00:01:00,740
because they weren't sure that it was serious enough.

21
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:03,140
Oh my god.

22
00:01:03,180 --> 00:01:04,900
That's really sad.

23
00:01:04,900 --> 00:01:06,680
Yeah, I believe that. I'm surprised it's not more.

24
00:01:06,820 --> 00:01:08,300
I, in my work as an RA,

25
00:01:08,300 --> 00:01:11,420
I come up with that a lot
because I'm always you know offering

26
00:01:11,430 --> 00:01:13,380
resources, telling women what our options are.

27
00:01:13,380 --> 00:01:14,520
And so many of them just say

28
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:17,480
"I don't want to go through that ordeal, I
know it's gonna end poorly".

29
00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:18,270
And I -- how can

30
00:01:18,270 --> 00:01:19,220
I disagree with that?

31
00:01:19,220 --> 00:01:21,630
I struggled when everyone was posting the Me Too

32
00:01:21,630 --> 00:01:22,590
stuff online.

33
00:01:22,590 --> 00:01:24,800
Like, it... does my
story count?

34
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:26,220
Or am I detracting from this

35
00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:29,970
movement, you know, I want to say Me Too
to like acknowledge how prevalent

36
00:01:29,970 --> 00:01:31,040
all of this is,

37
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:33,140
but if no one grabbed me,

38
00:01:33,140 --> 00:01:35,770
if it was a compliment that really

39
00:01:35,770 --> 00:01:37,640
was inappropriate for the workplace you know?

40
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:39,740
It's like that... it was always on that line.

41
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:47,160
I don't know any woman, my age,

42
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:50,200
I can't speak for younger who hasn't

43
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:52,700
been the object of sexual harassment.

44
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:55,640
They would always take the male side,

45
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:58,020
because the male was in power.

46
00:01:58,740 --> 00:02:01,000
Like, I went for a job interview one time

47
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,360
as a waitress

48
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:05,240
and I had waitressing
experience

49
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:09,280
and the man said "turn around and walk away from me so I can see your legs."

50
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:13,620
And... it's... you know, so I did.

51
00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:16,680
I mean, we did. We just expected it.

52
00:02:17,460 --> 00:02:21,660
Those were the days, you know, every man was entitled

53
00:02:21,660 --> 00:02:23,860
and every woman was not entitled.

54
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:33,900
Do you think that the way this movement is happening, do you think it will have a positive impact?

55
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:36,340
Are you optimistic about the movement?

56
00:02:36,340 --> 00:02:37,200
Oh, yes.

57
00:02:38,540 --> 00:02:40,160
It's going to have an impact.

58
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:41,780
It already has, I feel.

59
00:02:41,780 --> 00:02:44,620
I don't think it's gonna go away,

60
00:02:44,620 --> 00:02:47,160
because women are free and

61
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:52,220
they feel -- they now know that other women
are experiencing the same.

62
00:02:52,220 --> 00:02:54,040
We just have to find our place.

63
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:58,480
I hope it continues, I think there is a lot of potential there.

64
00:02:59,780 --> 00:03:02,480
But it feels like everything is so up in the air these days

65
00:03:02,580 --> 00:03:06,280
that I have no idea how long it'll
last before people say "this has gone too far"

66
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:08,700
and like, "these accusations aren't
big enough"

67
00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:09,580
and that's my fear.

68
00:03:09,580 --> 00:03:13,140
It's catching on, I mean women everywhere are
hearing it.

69
00:03:13,140 --> 00:03:15,260
There has to be momentum.

70
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:19,360
I think it's there and, you know, women's
lives will be better.

71
00:03:19,540 --> 00:03:20,360
I think it's not

72
00:03:20,370 --> 00:03:21,660
about women, it's about men.

73
00:03:21,660 --> 00:03:23,400
That's the change that needs to take place and

74
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:25,840
right now I really only see women
claiming Me Too.

75
00:03:25,960 --> 00:00:00,000
So, question mark. For now.
