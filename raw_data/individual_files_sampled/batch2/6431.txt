audio so yesterday Donald Trump announces well here's an executive order and we're not going to separate kids from their families anymore now we're still gonna charge those parents who cross the border and that's a misdemeanor in the past we did not pursue those charges because we thought it was a waste of time and money especially if we're going to deport those families anyway but Donald Trump disagrees and he wants to prosecute them and perhaps up to as much as long as six months but he's gonna say he said yesterday basically that he would keep the kids with their families so presumably they would spend time in detention together so now a wrinkle to that story what happened to the kids that already got separated from their parents well there is a number of disturbing elements to that so first let me go to HuffPost here president Donald Trump signed an executive order they explained on Wednesday and to end his administration's policy of separating undocumented immigrant families and instead detained parents with their children but the reversal which could face a legal battle likely won't apply to more than 2,300 children who have already been separated from their parents the Department of Health and Human Services said so in fact Kenneth wolf the ACF spokesperson said quote there will not be a grandfathering of existing cases so to grandfather something means to say that the new rules apply retroactively ly to the people that were affected earlier so he says that will not happen so if the for the two months that we have the rule that we're going to separate the kids we're gonna keep it that way 2300 kids that got separated sad day for you we're not gonna put you back with your parents so that's disturbing to say the least now they claim no that's alright eventually they'll get back together but as you'll see at the end of the story turns out no a lot of them are being deported without their kids oh Jesus okay so now we're gonna go to some people who are tracking this Elizabeth Frankel with the young Center for immigrant children's rights says about the kids that are being detained quote they're in crisis they're just crying uncontrollably so that's the kids unfortunately there's also the parents now we go to a report about Erick Henshaw he is a assistant federal public defender in Texas so here's the report on a Ross story about it a public defender who handles immigration cases said the government has no answers for parents separated from their children at the border and no apparent intention of ever reuniting those shattered families Wow now the government says no no no at some point they'll probably get reunited I mean we had some procedure for that and apparently it isn't being applied as you're about to see you're here because it's not just Henshaw saying it it's also a judge so deeply problem has already been executed people have already been deported without their kids so it's an absolute mess the problem always comes back to the same thing Donald Trump could not manage his way out of a wet paper bag that is why he'd bankrupted six different companies he is a terrible terrible manager he doesn't do his homework he doesn't bother to do any of the details or any planning so that's why you have the holy mess that we're in right now so let me go to hand shoe he says the client meetings have been crushing one man sobs asking how his small child could defend himself in a detention facility one Christ so uncontrollably he is hardly able to speak question after crying question piles up from one client to the next so deeply disturbing now that's both the children and the parents crying by the way what aspect of this I didn't even think of one of the clients says I don't know how to read or write remember they are running from terrible violence in Central America and and some of those places are in remote areas with not very good education so they don't since they don't know how to read and write some of them some of them don't even know how to write out their kids names so how we're gonna find the kids maybe that's why we shouldn't have separated them in the first place so now let me go to New York hundreds of children have been sent to shelters in New York City Mayor Bill DeBlasio said on Wednesday while some parents have already been deported without their children Jesus how the hell are they ever going to get back together is anyone tracking this the incompetence of Donald Trump and his administration knows no bounds okay finally back to hen shoe he explains that one point during the proceedings the judge slammed his hand on the desk sending a pen flying this type of emotional display is unheard of in federal court I can't understand this the judge said if someone at the jail takes your wallet they give you a receipt they take your kids and you get nothing not even a slip of paper that is what the judge was asking the prosecutor and the prosecutor had no good answers these fools they separated the kids from the parents without a good plan to bring him back together so now some of the parents are being sent away without the kids when they go to court to get the kids people don't have a good way of tracking where the kids are now well if we go to release the kids who are we going to release them to this is an unbelievable mess no one had to do this there was it was not done in the past there was no imperative to do this Trump chose to make a giant mess out of it two months later he after getting tremendous criticism for it he reversed his direction but he didn't have a good playing going in he doesn't have a good plan going out so right now those families are separated with no decent plan on how to put them back together again two
