CNN is reporting that paperwork is in the works in regard to more Trump pardons and the majority of these pardons could have to do with people similar to Alice Marie Johnson usually individuals who got outrageous ridiculous sentences for the crimes that they were convicted of now according to CNN the administration has prepared the pardoning paperwork for at least 30 people while Trump has expressed interest in recent days in doing so his chief of staff John Kelly has advocated against it and that's according to two sources familiar with these negotiations they spoke to CNN on the condition of anonymity so to me this is the giant difference so we like the least Marie Johnson we'd like to Jack Johnson one that was a incredible injustice against Jack Johnson who was a legendary boxer and and almost certainly because of racial issues back in the day so we don't like the political ones that he's doing so do we like the new ones well it depends who's he pardoning and why is he pardoning them and so if he's partnering a bunch of criminals who were violated campaign finance laws and we're involved in corruption and the swab we say no that's terrible and it's goes towards his correction but if he goes in like we've been fair to him on the other pardons if he pardons people he really shouldn't be pardoning great wonderful and if he bucks the establishment to do it even better you know who I really want him to pardon all of those immigrants who come to the border seeking refuge like instead of prosecuting them how about you pardon them you know if you don't want them in the country that's one thing which I would argue if they're seeking refuge how about hear them out right but I would rather you not prosecute them in any circumstance and not take their children away so look again this goes back to the primary reason why he's issuing these pardons if he wasn't under investigation and if he didn't have friends facing significant prison time would he be focused on pardoning as many as 30 people in the near future probably not so it wouldn't even be on his mind and it's interesting because look the whole pardoning pattern that we're seeing with Trump has now inspired a lot of people good people to come forward and ask him for help right so that's a good thing that's I guess the silver lining to his possible obstruction of justice units I call it an orange lining but yes an orange lining but it is it is interesting to hear him you know issuing so many pardons so early on in his first and hopefully only term look it must be noted that yes Horton's who usually come later in the term and i know again if you're a Magra guy you're not gonna believe anything but for all the rest of you it's unusual how many pardons he's doing early on some good some bad as we've explained and if you think it has nothing to do with people publicly going out on television saying oh yes my husband who was part of your campaign would like a pardon come on of course it has do that Roger stone even said it wasn't one of his top henchmen and allies said yes of course he's doing the pardon so he can send a message to all the people don't collaborate or work with the special counsel don't admit your guilt don't worry Trump will pardon you anyway and then Trump goes on Twitter just to make it absolutely clear he goes no remember everybody I could absolutely pardon myself let alone his allies and his cronies he's talking about pardoning himself come on any objective person realizes he's in a panic he's worried he's gonna have to pardon the guys that broke laws with him right let alone himself well if you have any ability to reach out to him and ask for a pardon for someone who genuinely deserves it now is the time to do Oh totally is right for everybody right I mean whoever you are if you're a celebrity or viewer on the apprentice or whatever go go get pardons for good people this is the time if there are people who have life sentences for nonviolent drug crimes get them pardoned yes yeah if you're looking to represent political hacks please stop can go home two easy ways follow Young Turks want us hit the subscribe button down below then you're a TYT subscriber and second is ring the bell and when you do that YouTube you're notified of our videos
