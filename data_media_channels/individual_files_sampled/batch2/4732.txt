I don't know about you but I was amused too when people legally certify that they're gonna do something that they do it but I think this was clearly a mistake in retrospect joining us now Roger McNamee he was an early investor in facebook and a former mentor to Mark Zuckerberg and Kevin ruse of business columnist for The New York Times and writer at large for the New York Times Magazine he also interviewed Mark Zuckerberg today and Kevin some of what Mark Zuckerberg said in his television interview is word-for-word things that he said to you one of them from your article is this Zuckerberg said I feel a lot better about the system's now at the same time I think Russia and other governments are going to get more sophisticated in what they do too so we need to make sure that we up our game this is a massive focus for us to make sure we're dialed in for not only the 2018 elections in the US but the Indian elections the Brazilian elections a number of other elections that are going on this year that are really important what does that mean what does dialed-in mean what are the specifics of that do we know well you said that they're taking steps to use artificial intelligence and other tools to identify people who are behaving badly on their platforms so as an example he revealed for the first time today that he that Facebook had caught some Macedonian accounts trying to interfere in the Alabama special election last December by pushing false news on Facebook so he uses the example of the of those kinds of tools but what he's really talking about is just getting ready for all the possible ways that a foreign government that a bad actor might try to game Facebook and exploit its platform to tip an election Roger Mark Zuckerberg said something tonight that I find very difficult to believe he said I don't know about you but I believe people I believe people in business when they tell me they've done something I suspect that Mark Zuckerberg has contracts with people and with companies and that's when he believes that something is actually real only when there's an actual written contract to perform something Laurence you are so right I mean I've known mark since he was 22 years old and the one thing I can tell you is that the issues he's talked about today have been on the table since eleven when they signed the consent decree with the Federal Trade Commission they have essentially pretended as though that consent decree did not exist they have not put in the kind of infrastructure necessary to actually protect consumer data they've not done anything to actually vet the people who've been grabbing the stuff and this notion that somehow they should be allowed to have time now to figure all this out I think it's laughable and I look at the election stuff and let's get real all of these problems exists because of an advertising business model that creates perverse incentives and gives them the incentive essentially to create these bubbles around people where each person has their own set of facts and where they're easily manipulated by bad actors and Roger just to stay on that for a second you're saying the consent decree required Facebook to protect all of this kind of data that Cambridge analytic obtained well actually it required them to have clear notification and customer approval for any use of the data and they clearly did not do that they buried things deep into their Terms of Service which are buried deep in the site they made no constructive efforts they didn't have anybody on the team as far as I can tell to go out there and actually audit the people who are getting all of this data and so if you look at this the company was growing really rapidly they viewed all of that kind of regulatory stuff as friction and their strategy was just to ignore all friction and just assume none of it was going to be a problem and the only reason they feel sorry about it now is because they got caught and Kevin Mark Zuckerberg has said repeatedly today keeps using this word certified he keeps saying that Cambridge analytic assert off' ID that they weren't doing these things what does he mean by certified it's unclear but there's been some reporting that what he means is they sent a letter and said check this box if you haven't been doing anything untoward with our data and they sent it back and that was the end of it and I think that's sort of the approach that they've taken is they've given away now data through millions of apps I mean millions of apps have been built on top of Facebook I checked my own Facebook today just to see how many apps I had given permission to to grab my profile information 90 some of which I haven't used in many years so everyone has been doing this for so long and giving permission for their data to be used by these apps that this is really now trying to put something back in the bottle that escaped a long time ago there's so much data out there and Facebook has no real way of clawing and most of it back and and Roger go ahead lawrence the real problem here is remember that when Cambridge analytic Atuk this content from Facebook Facebook should have had people monitoring at the time it took them a year to find out they found out because the Guardian reported it and then worse than that less than a year later Facebook had embedded people in the Trump campaign working side by side with Cambridge analytical people who were trying to get Trump elected and they were working together using the exact same data and you cannot convince me for a minute that the people in Facebook headquarters did not realize that this is the same Cambridge analytic that had they had punished you know less than a year before I mean all of this is just completely unbelievable and Kevin you know I I'm no visionary and in these matters I never could have foreseen how Facebook was used but Mark Zuckerberg you know he's thinking about Facebook and its capacities and the potentials and theoretical potentials he's been thinking about them since he was in college and he's now gonna act very very surprised that this kind of thing was possible well he's not wrong that Facebook is a very different thing than it was in 2004 when it was a social network for college kids I mean Facebook is now this global platform for information and communication they haven't changed their approach entirely since they were that social network for college kids and sometimes I think Facebook is like the you know the in the old cartoons were the guys on the train and it's going down the tracks he's laying the tracks right in front of the Train feels like that sometimes we're their new problems are hitting them every day whether it's foreign interference in elections or fake and false news or macedonians trying to interfere in Alabama and they're just trying as hard as they can to catch up and I don't know that they'll ever get there I think it might be it might be an insurmountable problem Roger is there an innocent angle here that would go something along of yeah you know they they knew they should try to protect this data but if they fail to protect this data what's the worst that could happen well you could lose democracy in Western Europe and North America but I mean Lawrence I think the fundamental problem we're dealing with here is that you know if I use Kevin's thing they were just going too fast they need to slow down and they need to do it right the first time Roger McNamee Kevin Roose thank you both for joining us tonight
