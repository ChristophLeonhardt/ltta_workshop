1
00:00:00,653 --> 00:00:01,687
IDENTIFY AND TRACK DRONE

2
00:00:01,687 --> 00:00:03,222
STRIKES COULD BE USED FOR

3
00:00:03,222 --> 00:00:04,057
LETHAL PURPOSES.

4
00:00:04,057 --> 00:00:06,059
PETE, TAKE IT AWAY.

5
00:00:06,059 --> 00:00:06,592
PETE: THANKS, ABBY.

6
00:00:06,592 --> 00:00:08,494
THE CULTURE WARS CONTINUE

7
00:00:08,494 --> 00:00:09,495
ACROSS THE GLOS GLOBE AS

8
00:00:09,495 --> 00:00:10,930
THEY DO EVERY WEEK.

9
00:00:10,930 --> 00:00:11,864
THERE ARE CRUCIAL STORIES

10
00:00:11,864 --> 00:00:13,166
THAT YOU MAY HAVE MISSED

11
00:00:13,166 --> 00:00:13,566
THIS WEEK.

12
00:00:13,566 --> 00:00:14,967
HERE TO FILL US IN AND GIVE

13
00:00:14,967 --> 00:00:16,502
US HER TAKE IS THE

14
00:00:16,502 --> 00:00:18,538
CONSERVATIVE MILLENNIAL AND

15
00:00:18,538 --> 00:00:20,506
CR-TV HOST ALLIE BETH

16
00:00:20,506 --> 00:00:20,873
STUCKEY.

17
00:00:20,873 --> 00:00:21,941
ALLI, THANK YOU FOR BEING

18
00:00:21,941 --> 00:00:22,475
HERE THIS MORNING.

19
00:00:22,475 --> 00:00:25,111
>> THANKS FOR HAVING ME.

20
00:00:25,111 --> 00:00:25,878
PETE: NEWS MOVES SO FAST.

21
00:00:25,878 --> 00:00:27,346
THERE IS A LOT OF STUFF WE

22
00:00:27,346 --> 00:00:27,680
MISS.

23
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:28,414
WE WILL GO THROUGH THREE

24
00:00:28,414 --> 00:00:28,848
STORIES HERE.

25
00:00:28,848 --> 00:00:30,316
THE FIRST IS OUT OF

26
00:00:30,316 --> 00:00:30,683
AUSTRALIA.

27
00:00:30,683 --> 00:00:31,451
I WANT TO READ THIS HEADLINE

28
00:00:31,451 --> 00:00:33,653
FOR YOU.

29
00:00:33,653 --> 00:00:35,555
IT IS NO BOYS ALOUD, NO

30
00:00:35,555 --> 00:00:36,689
GIRLS EITHER.

31
00:00:36,689 --> 00:00:38,357
AUSTRALIA IS ACTUALLY

32
00:00:38,357 --> 00:00:40,860
AUDITING KIDS' BOOKS TO MAKE

33
00:00:40,860 --> 00:00:42,862
SURE THEY AREN'T TOO GENDER

34
00:00:42,862 --> 00:00:43,229
SPECIFIC.

35
00:00:43,229 --> 00:00:44,063
TELL US ABOUT THIS.

36
00:00:44,063 --> 00:00:46,365
>> NOT JUST KIDS BOOKS, BUT

37
00:00:46,365 --> 00:00:47,266
ALSO TOLD.

38
00:00:47,266 --> 00:00:48,434
THEY ARE TRYING TO ALITTLE

39
00:00:48,434 --> 00:00:50,803
BIT RATE ANY KIND OF GENDER

40
00:00:50,803 --> 00:00:51,637
DISTINCTION IN ORDER TO

41
00:00:51,637 --> 00:00:53,272
ADVANCE THE BALL DOWN THE

42
00:00:53,272 --> 00:00:54,307
GENDER EQUITY COURT.

43
00:00:54,307 --> 00:00:55,908
OF COURSE THIS IS SOCIAL

44
00:00:55,908 --> 00:00:56,309
ENGINEERING.

45
00:00:56,309 --> 00:00:58,478
WE SAW THIS IN SWEDEN.

46
00:00:58,478 --> 00:01:00,246
SWEDEN HAS GENDER NEUTRAL

47
00:01:00,246 --> 00:01:01,380
PRESCHOOLS IN WHICH BOYS ARE

48
00:01:01,380 --> 00:01:03,015
TAUGHT TO BE MORE LIKE GIRLS

49
00:01:03,015 --> 00:01:04,382
AND GIRLS ARE TAUGHT TO BE

50
00:01:04,382 --> 00:01:05,184
MORE LIKE BOYS.

51
00:01:05,184 --> 00:01:06,352
WHAT THEY FOUND OVER MORE

52
00:01:06,352 --> 00:01:08,454
THAN A DECADE OF STUDYING.

53
00:01:08,454 --> 00:01:10,790
BOYS AND GIRLS ARE NO LONGER

54
00:01:10,790 --> 00:01:11,958
FOLLOW ALONG GENDER

55
00:01:11,958 --> 00:01:12,358
STEREOTYPES.

56
00:01:12,358 --> 00:01:14,093
THAT'S BECAUSE GENDER AND

57
00:01:14,093 --> 00:01:15,862
SEX ARE SCIENTIFICALLY

58
00:01:15,862 --> 00:01:16,929
ERNESTO TWIND FG TWINSD.

59
00:01:16,929 --> 00:01:19,632
THE MORE WE ADVANCE THIS

60
00:01:19,632 --> 00:01:20,600
ANTISCIENCE AGENDA THE MORE

61
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:21,701
CONFUSED OUR KIDS WILL BE

62
00:01:21,701 --> 00:01:23,936
AND UNSTABLE THEY WILL BE AS

63
00:01:23,936 --> 00:01:24,337
ADULTS.

64
00:01:24,337 --> 00:01:25,338
PETE: THEY GET CONFUSED AND

65
00:01:25,338 --> 00:01:27,039
DOESN'T WORK.

66
00:01:27,039 --> 00:01:29,342
HYPER FEMINIZED TOYS SUCH AS

67
00:01:29,342 --> 00:01:29,675
BARBIES.

68
00:01:29,675 --> 00:01:31,177
>> WHATEVER THAT MEANS.

69
00:01:31,177 --> 00:01:32,311
PETE: NO BARBIES OR TRUCKS

70
00:01:32,311 --> 00:01:33,012
ON EITHER SIDE.

71
00:01:33,012 --> 00:01:33,579
ALL RIGHT.

72
00:01:33,579 --> 00:01:35,581
WHERE HAVE WE GONE?

73
00:01:35,581 --> 00:01:37,617
SECOND STORY HERE, LOUISIANA

74
00:01:37,617 --> 00:01:38,718
PASSED SOME OF THE MOST

75
00:01:38,718 --> 00:01:39,852
STRICT ABORTION LAWS IN THE

76
00:01:39,852 --> 00:01:40,720
COUNTRY, I BELIEVE.

77
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:41,854
THEY ARE SETTING THE LIMIT

78
00:01:41,854 --> 00:01:42,655
AT 15 WEEKS.

79
00:01:42,655 --> 00:01:44,023
TELL US ABOUT THIS.

80
00:01:44,023 --> 00:01:45,391
>> WELL, WHAT'S INTERESTING

81
00:01:45,391 --> 00:01:46,859
ABOUT THIS, IS THIS WAS A

82
00:01:46,859 --> 00:01:48,094
DEMOCRATIC GOVERNOR THAT

83
00:01:48,094 --> 00:01:49,128
ACTUALLY SIGNED THIS BILL

84
00:01:49,128 --> 00:01:50,596
WHICH JUST GOES TO SHOW THAT

85
00:01:50,596 --> 00:01:51,764
THE PRO-LIFE MOVEMENT REALLY

86
00:01:51,764 --> 00:01:53,866
SHOULDN'T BE A RIGHT OR LEFT

87
00:01:53,866 --> 00:01:54,167
ISSUE.

88
00:01:54,167 --> 00:01:55,701
IT IS A HUMAN RIGHTS ISSUE.

89
00:01:55,701 --> 00:01:57,470
UNBORN RIGHTS ARE HUMAN

90
00:01:57,470 --> 00:01:57,803
RIGHTS.

91
00:01:57,803 --> 00:01:59,205
15 WEEKS AN UNBORN CHILD IS

92
00:01:59,205 --> 00:02:00,206
ALREADY STARTING TO LOOK

93
00:02:00,206 --> 00:02:01,807
LIKE HIS OR HER MOTHER.

94
00:02:01,807 --> 00:02:03,643
THEY MIGHT ALREADY START TO

95
00:02:03,643 --> 00:02:04,577
FEEL PAIN AT THIS POINT.

96
00:02:04,577 --> 00:02:07,346
SO THIS IS A COMMON SENSE

97
00:02:07,346 --> 00:02:08,314
DECENT HUMAN RIGHTS LAW.

98
00:02:08,314 --> 00:02:10,049
AND I WISH THE REST OF THE

99
00:02:10,049 --> 00:02:13,452
COUNTRY WOULD FOLLOW SUIT.

100
00:02:13,452 --> 00:02:14,387
PETE: ALLEY, IT'S GREAT TO

101
00:02:14,387 --> 00:02:15,354
SEE STREETS TAKING THE

102
00:02:15,354 --> 00:02:15,755
PREROGATIVE.

103
00:02:15,755 --> 00:02:16,689
YOU LIVE THERE AND VOTE FOR

104
00:02:16,689 --> 00:02:18,057
THAT AND VOTE FOR PEOPLE WHO

105
00:02:18,057 --> 00:02:18,958
SUPPORT THAT GOOD FOR YOU.

106
00:02:18,958 --> 00:02:20,293
>> EXACTLY.

107
00:02:20,293 --> 00:02:20,927
PETE: THANK YOU FOR

108
00:02:20,927 --> 00:02:21,561
HIGHLIGHTING THAT STORY.

109
00:02:21,561 --> 00:02:22,461
THIRD STORY HERE.

110
00:02:22,461 --> 00:02:23,963
SO, CALIFORNIA KEEPS ACTING

111
00:02:23,963 --> 00:02:26,232
LIKE A COUNTRY.

112
00:02:26,232 --> 00:02:29,168
IT HAS NOW BANNED STATE

113
00:02:29,168 --> 00:02:30,036
FUNDED TRAVEL TO OKLAHOMA

114
00:02:30,036 --> 00:02:32,171
BECAUSE IT CONSIDERS THE

115
00:02:32,171 --> 00:02:34,006
POLICIES THERE

116
00:02:34,006 --> 00:02:36,242
DISCRIMINATORY TOWARD LBGT

117
00:02:36,242 --> 00:02:36,542
FOLKS.

118
00:02:36,542 --> 00:02:38,678
WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF THAT?

119
00:02:38,678 --> 00:02:40,546
>> LET'S LOOK AT THESE

120
00:02:40,546 --> 00:02:41,747
DISCRIMINATORY POLICIES.

121
00:02:41,747 --> 00:02:43,983
SO OKLAHOMA HAS SIMPLY SAID

122
00:02:43,983 --> 00:02:45,418
THAT PRIVATE ADOPTION

123
00:02:45,418 --> 00:02:47,186
AGENCIES CAN OPERATE OUT OF

124
00:02:47,186 --> 00:02:48,387
THEIR RELIGIOUS CONVICTIONS

125
00:02:48,387 --> 00:02:49,956
BY SAYING HEY, SAME SEX

126
00:02:49,956 --> 00:02:51,490
COUPLES MIGHT NOT BE ABLE TO

127
00:02:51,490 --> 00:02:51,791
ADOPT.

128
00:02:51,791 --> 00:02:53,826
YOU DON'T HAVE TO AGREE WITH

129
00:02:53,826 --> 00:02:55,528
THAT PARTICULAR ADOPTION

130
00:02:55,528 --> 00:02:56,762
AGENCY TO AGREE WITH THEIR

131
00:02:56,762 --> 00:02:57,463
RIGHT TO DO SO.

132
00:02:57,463 --> 00:02:59,599
LIKE YOU SAID, CALIFORNIA IS

133
00:02:59,599 --> 00:03:00,733
OPERATING LIKE A COUNTRY.

134
00:03:00,733 --> 00:03:02,635
THEY OPERATE IN A WORLD THAT

135
00:03:02,635 --> 00:03:03,769
DOESN'T HONOR RELIGIOUS

136
00:03:03,769 --> 00:03:05,605
FREEDOM OR THE FIRST

137
00:03:05,605 --> 00:03:06,839
AMENDMENT OR THE

138
00:03:06,839 --> 00:03:07,673
CONSTITUTION FOR THAT

139
00:03:07,673 --> 00:03:08,608
MATTER.  THIS IS THE SAME

140
00:03:08,608 --> 00:03:11,477
STATE THAT SAID PRO-LIFE

141
00:03:11,477 --> 00:03:13,512
ADOPTION AGENCIES OR

142
00:03:13,512 --> 00:03:14,380
PRO-LIFE HEALTH CENTERS YOU

143
00:03:14,380 --> 00:03:15,147
HAVE TO ADVERTISE FOR

144
00:03:15,147 --> 00:03:15,514
ABORTION.

145
00:03:15,514 --> 00:03:20,386
THEY ALSO SAID THAT HEY,

146
00:03:20,386 --> 00:03:22,121
WE'RE GOING TO BAN SERVICES

147
00:03:22,121 --> 00:03:23,723
THAT PROMOTE ANY TYPE OF

148
00:03:23,723 --> 00:03:25,791
SEXUAL ORIENTATION REFORM.

149
00:03:25,791 --> 00:03:26,859
THIS IS NOT NECESSARILY A

150
00:03:26,859 --> 00:03:28,327
STATE THAT HONORS FREE

151
00:03:28,327 --> 00:03:29,428
SPEECH OR FREEDOM OF

152
00:03:29,428 --> 00:03:29,795
RELIGION.

153
00:03:29,795 --> 00:03:30,796
I'M NOT SURPRISED TO SEE

154
00:03:30,796 --> 00:03:32,465
THEM OPERATING THIS WAY.

155
00:03:32,465 --> 00:03:33,499
PETE: NOT EVEN A STATE THAT

156
00:03:33,499 --> 00:03:34,533
FORCES ITS OWN LAW.

157
00:03:34,533 --> 00:03:35,568
STATES WHERE YOU CAN'T GO

158
00:03:35,568 --> 00:03:37,136
AND DOESN'T ENFORCE THEIR

159
00:03:37,136 --> 00:00:00,000
OWN IMMIGRATION LAWS.
