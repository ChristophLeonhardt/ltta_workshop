welcome back what message is President Trump about to send around the globe what message is he about to send to Syria to Russia to our allies and to his base the world is watching the White House right now after a suspected chemical weapons attack in Syria killed dozens of people according to Syrian opposition activists and aid groups a warning these pictures are difficult to watch eyewitnesses say dozens were killed and hundreds were treated in duma which is one of the last rebel-held cities near Syria's capital city of Damascus Moscow serious staunchest ally says there were no chemical weapons and calls the attack made up President Trump today called the attack heinous we are studying that situation extremely closely we are meeting with our military and everybody else and we'll be making some major decisions over the next 24 to 48 hours we are very concerned what a thing like that can happen this is about humanity we're talking about humanity and it can't be allowed to happen and the administration is warning that there will be a big price to pay I don't rule out anything right now thank you very much nothing's off the table nothing's off the table folks maybe the biggest development in this is that President Trump whose cosy relationship with Russia is under scrutiny and who has been reluctant to criticize Putin publicly attacked the Russian leader by name mr. Trump tweeted yesterday quote President Putin Russia and Iran are responsible for backing animal Assad and today he hinted that there could be consequences it's buton bear responsibility for those he made he made and if he does it's going to be very tough it's very time he'll pay a price if everybody to pay a price he will everybody will if it's Russia if it's Syria if it's Iran if it's all of them together we'll figure it out let's bring in former US ambassador to Iraq and NBC News contributor Chris Hill ambassador thank you so much for being here John McCain had a pretty forceful statement out about linking the president's words his past statements to President Assad becoming more bold in Syria President Trump last week signaled to the world that the US would prematurely withdraw from Syria Bashar Assad and his Russian and Iranian backers have heard him and emboldened by American inaction Assad has reportedly launched another chemical attack against innocent men women and children it sure sounds like he's placing the blame for this attack on the president's shoulders do you agree well he sure is doing just that and I think John McCain has been pretty clear and his views about Trump and frankly recent years so I think the real issue for Trump is he looks at a situation on the ground where Russia is very much in Scots there where the Iranians are there and we're sadly Bashar al Assad the leader of Syria seems to be winning in fact one of the arguments that Assad made or his people made about this whole issue is why would we why would he do that what's the logic of that when he's already winning well sadly of course logic is not the most operative element in Syria I think spite and hatred plays a huge role so the question is what does Trump going to do and I would expect he's going to try to stay close to the allies I think the French had been through particularly appalled by all this he's going to try to stay close to them but he's got to do something more than he did a year ago which I think people have pointed out clearly did not deter Assad and as for the ad hominem criticism of of Putin I wouldn't put too much into that let's see how that goes in the coming days and weeks after all he's gonna let some pressure off on that issue had he not talked about Putin that would been an enormous omission at this point so let's see how that plays out you mentioned what happened last year so after the chemical attack that shocked the president last year he launched airstrikes on a military base some folks at the time said it while it was a good show of force it wasn't really gonna change much because that military break base wasn't entirely operational even though some planes had taken off from there to drop those chemical weapons if you think he needs to do more what exactly does that look like well the problem is there's a constraint because the Russians are essentially everywhere in Syria and I doubt he wants to get into a situation where American bombs start killing Russians or Russians kill American pilots but I think it's got to be more than what he did a year ago it's what he did a year ago is very reminiscent of what we went through then in the Balkans the Serbs would do something totally outrageous and we'd hit them with something we called at the time pinprick a bombing and I think he doesn't want to be accused of anything like that so I think it's going to be more but I rather doubt it's going to be to the degree that for example Senator Graham talked about today somehow taking out the Syrian Air Force I think to do that you'd end up staking out some Russians and I don't think he or the American people are really prepared for kind of shooting war with Russians you an ambassador nikki Haley was pretty tough today listen to what she said we are beyond showing pictures of dead babies we are beyond appeals to conscience we have reached the moment when the world must see justice done history will record this as the moment when the Security Council either discharged its duty or demonstrated its utter and complete failure to protect the people of Syria either way the United States will respond let's be honest the UN's not going to do anything any resolution they might pass Russia is going to veto and they've got veto power so they're completely ineffective in this scenario you have john bolton his first day was today the new National Security Advisor always being described as a hawk but when it comes to Syria back in 2013 when he was on Fox News he advocated that President Obama not do anything that Congress not do anything in response to a chemical attack back then do you think his calculus will have changed now that he's in this administration I think it'll be a question of you know where you sit is where you stand and I suspect we'll see a somewhat different john bolton than we've heard on fox news in recent years I think he's got to be concerned about the president getting in over his head in the form of a kind of shooting war with Russia at the same time he's got to be concerned about the accusations of fecklessness if we just do a pinprick strike so they've got to find something in between and I do hope they're on the phone with the allies especially president mark Ronald France who's been very clear that France doesn't want to stand by here yeah it would be a helpful exercise that the u.s. worked with other countries ambassador I wanna I just want to ask one more question is anything gonna change here I mean even if there was some sort of coordinated strike is any of that gonna deter passar al-assad from attacking his own people so long as he has Russia's support well he has a track record that we all know but I think it's important to understand he's on the cusp of actually winning this war and I don't think anything we're going to do in the next few days is to change that basic fact that he's going to win this war ambassador Chris Hill ambassador thank you very much for joining us thank you hey there I'm Chris Hayes from MSNBC thanks for watching MSNBC on YouTube if you want to keep up to date with the videos we're putting out
