we have a deal a rare deal in the Senate and it's about health care and it's relatively good news it's only because Donald Trump last week gave us really bad news so now both parties had to scramble to find a way to fix the mess that he started so it this was about the cost-sharing reduction payments Donald Trump said yeah I'm gonna stop those so a lot of people's premiums were about to go up almost 30% in some cases and we would add 194 billion dollars to the deficit and 1 million people would lose their insurance so what's the upside there was no upside so and he just said he wants to destroy Obamacare so now some Republicans worked along with Democrats to try to fix us I'll tell you why in a second first let me tell you the news senator is a Lamar Alexander who was a Republican of Tennessee and patty Murray a Democrat of Washington had reached a deal in principle to restore the Affordable Care Act cost-sharing reduction payments for two years in exchange for more state flexibility in Obamacare good good that means that we're back to normal for two more years at least in that regard let's talk a little bit more about that state flexibility the deal would make it easier for states to obtain waivers to customize Obamacare rules to their needs states have complained that applying for waivers is a long and complicated process so that's not a completely wrong complaint but during the Obama administration part of the reason that they wanted to make sure that if you were gonna get a waiver from the Affordable Care Act and this is in the law your plan had to be better than the Affordable Care Act either premiums are lower or it covers more things and it could not take away things like coverage for pre-existing conditions now if they loosen that up then some of the plans might not be as good as the Affordable Care Act and then start a race to the bottom and and and so that hey look it's cheaper come here come here oh yeah but it was short term sad day for you as soon as you get sick you don't have insurance so you got to watch out for those tricks the Republicans are can't wait to put more responsive where they call responsibility to the states but it's actually a trap in a lot of ways now this deal if it comes to fruition and it was announced today that they're going to have this deal it's not the end of the world it's actually overall a good thing so any in fact president Donald Trump when asked about the deal called it a short-term solution but appeared supportive of the proposal so that's also positive so why are they doing it why in the world would Republicans want to do something that would shore up the Affordable Care Act and not destroy it well that's because they were complaining to President Trump before he signed that executive order hey this still taking their effect immediately in which case we could all lose our seats in 2018 because it's really bad it's terrible for the voters we want to do it we're with you I mean we're we want to help out our donors and more people lose insurance that it's hiring I don't care well I just don't want to do it right before the election because I might lose my seat so then they go over the Democrats and they go okay I'll give you something you want which is people not suffering in return you let me delay this till after the election now look I can't blame the Democrats on that to extend it for two years a good thing the Republicans might lose the elections anyway in which case then they can't repeal this provision anymore so I if I was patty Murray I'd have done the deal too and assuming that it goes all the way through a good job by the Democrats but understand why the Republicans are doing it it's their insurance policy for not losing their seats in 2018 and there's no other reason why they would have done it and they were clear on the record earlier telling Trump be careful that's really bad and they had worried about of course their own asses and this is what this is covering their asses but but overall good for America god bless TYT membership gives you commercial free young turks downloaded streaming podcasts that get all the network shows and support independent media TYT Network comm /join
