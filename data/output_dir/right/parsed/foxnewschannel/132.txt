HE IS THE PRESIDENT OF THE
TRUMP ORGANIZATION AND HIS
DAD IS THE PRESIDENT OF THE
UNITED STATES.
BRIAN: HOW MANY TIMES CAN
YOU SAY THAT?
>> THAT'S AN INTERESTING
INTRODUCTION.
AINSLEY: 19 DAYS AWAY FROM
THE MIDTERMS.
HOW DO YOU THINK IT'S GOING
TO TURN OUT?
>> I THINK WE ARE GOING TO
DO WELL.
REPUBLICANS HAVE TO GET OUT
AND VOTE.
IT'S JUST THAT SIMPLE.
I HEAR FROM PEOPLE ALL THE
TIME.
MY GUY.
MY GUY IS TRUMP.
MY GUY IS NOT ON THE BALLOT.
I'M NOT GOING TO GO OUT AND
VOTE.
PLEASE, PLEASE, WHATEVER DO
YOU YOU CANNOT THINK THAT
WAY.
BY NOT VOTING YOU ARE
EFFECTIVELY VOTING AGAINST
HIM.
WE NEED THE HOUSE AND THE
SENATE.
HE HAS GOTTEN MORE
ACCOMPLISHED IN THE LAST TWO
YEARS #THAN ARGUABLY ANY
PRESIDENT IN HISTORY.
THIS COUNTRY IS DOING SO
WELL ON EVERY FRONT.
PEOPLE HAVE TO GET OUT.
PEOPLE HAVE TO VOTE.
STEVE: BUT WE DETAILED SOME
VOTERS SAID TO YOUR FATHER
AT SOME OF THESE RALLIES YOU
ARE NOT ON THE BALLOT I'M
NOT GOING TO VOTE.
VOTE FOR ME ANYWAY THROUGH
THIS PERSON.
YEAH, WE THOUGHT YOU DIDN'T
LIKE CONGRESS.
BUT THEN YOUR FATHER WILL
ANSWER ACCORDING TO THIS
PRESS REPORT WE READ.
AND IT SAID, LOOK, I'M
WORKING WITH THE CONGRESS.
AND WITHOUT CONGRESS I CAN'T
GET ANYTHING DONE.
>> THERE IS A LOFT GREAT
PEOPLE ON THE BALLOT.
THERE IS A LOT OF PEOPLE
WITH BACKBONE AND HONESTLY
WE NEED MORE POLITICIANS
WITH BACKBONE.
YOU SAW WHAT HAPPENED A
COUPLE WEEKS AGO.
YOU NEED SOME GREAT PEOPLE
IN THERE.
THERE ARE SO MANY TIGHT
RACES.
PEOPLE HAVE TO GET OUT.
PEOPLE HAVE TO VOTE FOR THE
HOUSE AND SENATE.
BRIAN: WHAT DO YOU SEE YOUR
ROLE AS?
I KNOW DON WAS JUST IN
MICHIGAN HELPING OUT JOHN
JAMES AND YOUR WIFE HAS BEEN

WHERE DO YOU THINK YOU ARE
GOING TO BE GOING?
WHAT'S GOING TO BE YOUR
SCHEDULE FOR THE NEXT 19
DAYS.
>> I'M ALL OVER THE COUNTRY
IN TEXAS.
BRIAN: HELPING OUT TED CRUZ.
>> YES.
AND MANY OTHERS.
I GUESS MY ROLE IS TO PLAY
THE SON.
I BELIEVE IN MY FATHER AND
WHAT HE HAS DONE.
I'M ALSO AN AMERICAN.
I FUNDAMENTALLY BELIEVE WE
ARE IN SUCH A BETTER SPOT
TODAY THAN WE HAVE EVER BEEN
BEFORE.
WE HAVE THE HOTTEST MARKET
IN THE WORLD.
LOWEST UNEMPLOYMENT IN THE
WORLD.
I MEAN, LOOK AT CONSUMER
CONFIDENCE.
LOOK AT SMALL BUSINESSES.
LOOK AT MANUFACTURING COMING
BACK TO THIS NATION.
I MEAN, BY EVERY METRIC OUR
COUNTRY IS DOING AWESOME.
WE ARE DOING SO WELL.
ISIS IS ON THE RUN.
NORTH CAROLINA
.ORTH CAROLINA
.NOTH CAROLINA
.NORT CAROLINA
.NORTHCAROLINA
.NORTH KROLINA
.NORTH KORLINA
.NORTH KOREANA
.NORTH KOREA IS BEING TAKEN
CARE OF.
THINGS MEDIA DOESN'T WANT TO
TALK ABOUT.
OPIOID CRISIS HOW MY FATHER
IS TACKLING THAT.
PRISON REFORM.
OUR PRISON SYSTEMS HAVEN'T
BEEN FIXED IN 100 YEARS.
IS HE FOCUSING ON IT.
YOU WILL NEVER HEAR IT FROM
CNN AND THE MAINSTREAM
MEDIA.
AINSLEY: WE WANT TO PLAY A
SOUND BITE FROM YOUR FATHER
ASKING CABINET TO CUT THEIR
BUDGETS 5%.
LISTEN TO.
THIS I'M GOING TO ASK EACH
OF TO YOU COME BACK WITH A
5% BUDGET CUT FROM YOUR
VARIOUS DEPARTMENTS.
WHETHER IT'S A SECRETARY, AN
ADMINISTRATOR, WHATEVER.
I'M GOING TO ASK EVERYBODY
TO COME BACK WITH A 5% CUT
FOR OUR NEXT MEETING.
I THINK YOU WILL ALL BE ABLE
TO DO IT.
BRIAN: THAT'S IN RESPONSE TO
THE DEFICIT BEING 700 PLUS
BILLION DOLLARS.
IT'S THE HIGHEST SINCE 2012.
>> DO YOU KNOW WHO THAT IS?
THAT'S A BUSINESS GUY.
I WANT 5%.
NEXT YEAR I WANT ANOTHER 3%
THERE IS A LOT OF FAT.
YOU SEE THAT WHEN HE
RENEGOTIATED THE S 35
PROGRAM.
HE SAVED BILLIONS OF
DOLLARS.
WHEN HE RENEGOTIATE YOU HAD
AIR FORCE 1.
HE SAVED BILLIONS OF
DOLLARS.
THAT'S THE REAL ESTATE
DEVELOPER.
THAT'S THE GUY WHO GOT
ELECTED WHERE YOU WILL CALL
UP EVERY CONTRACTOR HEY I DO
IT IN MY OWN BUSINESS, IN
OUR BUSINESS IN THE TRUMP
ORGANIZATION.
YOU CALL U78 EVERY
CONTRACTOR AND GET THE BEST
POSSIBLE PRICE AND BEAT DOWN
THE PRICE.
THAT'S WHY YOU HAVE THAT HOW
MANY OTHER POLITICIANS WOULD
HAVE DONE THAT?
NONE, NONE.
BY THE WAY, THAT'S WHY YOU
HAVE A 20 TRILLION-DOLLAR
DEFICIT.
I MEAN, THE DEFICIT OVER
DOUBLED UNDER OBAMA.
AINSLEY: WE CAN UNDERSTAND
THAT.
>> 88 TRILLION TO
20 TRILLION.
STEVE: WE DON'T GO WITH THE
NICE MARBLE.
WE WILL GET SOMETHING ELSE.
BRIAN MENTIONED TED CRUZ A
MOMENT AGO.
YOU KNOW, TED CRUZ GOT
HOLLERED AT AT AN AIRPORT
YESTERDAY.
WE DID A STORY THIS MORNING
ABOUT HOW TWO CANDIDATES IN
MINNESOTA, REPUBLICAN
CANDIDATES WERE ASSAULTED.
WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF WHAT'S
GOING ON AND HAS ANYBODY
GOTTEN UP IN YOUR FACE?
>> YES.
LACK OF CIVILITY THAT ALWAYS
BOTHERS ME.
LOOK AT ERIC HOLDER A COUPLE
DAYS AGO.
WHEN THEY ARE DOWN WE KICK
THEM IN THE HEAD.
WHO SAYS THIS AND DOES THAT?
THEY'RE THE FIRST ONES TO
SAY TRUMP, HE PROMOTES EVIL
AND HE IS RACIST AND SEXIST.
YOU HEAR THESE PEOPLE.
YOU SAW WHAT HILLARY SAID
THE OTHER DAY.
IT'S TRULY, TRULY HORRIBLE.
STEVE: ARE THEY COMING AT
YOU.
>> YEAH.
THEY COME AFTER US.
STEVE: HOW, ON THE STREET?
AINSLEY: SECRET SERVICE BODY
SLAMS THOUGH, RIGHT?
>> WE WILL BE JUST FINE.
THAT LACK OF CIVILITY IS
REALLY INCREDIBLE.
THEY ARE THE FIRST PERSON TO
POINTS THE FINGER, HEY, THEY
PROMOTE HATE AND VIOLENCE.
HONESTLY YOU SAW THAT STORY
AND WHAT THEY DID TO THAT
NICE GIRL OUT IN NEVADA.
IT'S HORRIBLE.
I MEAN YOU, IT'S ABSOLUTELY
HORRIBLE.
BRIAN: ERIC, EVERY TIME
INTERNATIONAL INCIDENT THE
PRESIDENT IS TOO NICE TO
VLADIMIR PUTIN THAT'S
BECAUSE HE HAS TOO MANY
INVESTMENTS IN RUSSIA.
HE IS TOO OPEN TO LETTING
THIS INVESTIGATION PLAY OUT
THAT'S BECAUSE HE HAS
INVESTMENTS IN SAUDI ARABIA.
YOU ARE RUNNING THE TRUMP
ORGANIZATION.
WHAT'S THE RELATES.
>> ZERO INVESTMENTNESS
RUSSIA AND SEVERE
INVESTMENTS IN SAUDIS.
WE HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH
THOSE COUNTRIES.
MY FATHER HAS BEEN TOUGHER
ON RUSSIA THAN ANY OTHER
COUNTRY IN THE WORLD.
THAT'S WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU
GIVE OFFENSIVE WEAPONS TO
UKRAINE.
OBAMA NEVER DID THAT YOU
TAKE AWAY THEIR LARGEST
FINANCIAL STREAM, WHEN IS
OIL.
I MEAN, THAT'S WHAT BUILT,
OIL AND GAS IS WHAT BUILT
RUSSIA.
ALL OF A SUDDEN WE ARE
SAYING WHY DON'T YOU BUY
AMERICAN OIL A LOT OF GREAT
WORKERS AND ENERGY IN THE
U.S.
WE WILL SUPPLY YOU ALL THE
ENERGY YOU COULD EVER
POSSIBLY NEED.
DON'T BUY IT FROM RUSSIA.
AINSLEY: TALK TO YOUR DAD
WHAT'S HAPPENING IN SAUDI
ARABIA WITH THE JOURNALIST
IN TURKEY?
>> IT'S A HORRIBLE
SITUATION.
AINSLEY: WHAT ARE HIS
OPTIONS?
WHAT'S HE GOING TO DO.
>> HORRIBLE SITUATION.
THEY ARE STILL TRYING TO
FIGURE OUT WHAT'S GOING ON.
I DON'T THINK IT LOOKS GOOD
FOR THEM.
YOU KNOW, BUT I THINK THEY
ARE STILL TRYING TO GET TO
THE BOTTOM OF IT.
IT'S SAD.
YOU CAN'T GO AROUND, FOREIGN
COUNTRIES CAN'T GO AROUND
KILLING JOURNALISTS.
HORRIBLE WHAT HAPPENED THERE
EVEN MORE HORRIBLE THE
CIRCUMSTANCES.
AINSLEY: WHAT IS JARED
SAYING I KNOW HE IS CLOSE TO
THE PRINCE.
>> I HAVEN'T SPOKEN WITH HIM
WITH IT.
IT'S A SAD SITUATION.
OBVIOUSLY SOMETHING EVERYONE
HAS TO CONDEMN.
MY FATHER HAS.
BRIAN: WORD IS THEY WILL
START INVESTIGATING THE
TRUMP ORGANIZATION LET ALONE
THE PRESIDENT AND EVERYONE
AROUND HIM.
HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT HIM.
>> YOU WATCHED THE LEVEL OF
HARASSMENT.
HE THIS WILL BE
INVESTIGATING YOU, THEY WILL
INVESTIGATE EVERYBODY.
THAT'S WHAT THESE PEOPLE DO.
I MEAN, THEY WEAPONIZE THE
LEGAL SYSTEM.
THEY WILL COME AFTER
EVERYBODY RELENGTHLESSLY.
THEY KNOW THERE IS NOTHING
THERE.
BUT IT'S HARASS.
IT'S DISTRACT.
THEY WILL PLANT EVERY STORY.
I MEAN, WE HAVE SEEN.
THIS I CAN'T TELL YOU HOW
LONG WE HAVE SEEN THIS FOR.
WE WILL GET A LETTER FROM
SOME SENATOR.
THAT LETTER IS AT "THE
WASHINGTON POST" THREE DAYS
BEFORE WE EVEN RECEIVE IT.
IT IS THE NSAEST SYSTEM.
COMING FROM NEW YORK AND
BEING A TOTAL CIVILIAN IN
THIS PROCESS I HAVE NEVER
SEEN NASTINESS LIKE WE HAVE
SEEN FROM THESE PEOPLE.
IT'S CRUEL AND NASTY.
THAT'S WHY MY FATHER WENT TO
WASHINGTON.
AND THE SWAMP IS DEEP, GUYS.
DEEPER THAN YOU CAN EVER
IMAGINE.
STEVE: YOU WERE IN THE SWAMP
YESTERDAY.
YOU WERE DOWN IN WASHINGTON
GETTING, YOU KNOW, PROGRESS
REPORT FROM OUR NATION'S
CAPITAL.
IN THE LAST COUPLE OF WEEKS
WE HAVE SEEN A CHANGE IN THE
OUTREACH FROM THE WHITE
HOUSE WHERE WE ARE SEEING A
LOT MORE OF YOUR DAD.
HE HAS BEEN ON A LOT OF
CHANNELS.
HE WAS WITH US LAST WEEK FOR
47 MINUTES.
BRIAN: TRISH REGAN, STUART
VARNEY.
STEVE: ALL OVER THE PLACE.
IS IT BECAUSE HE IS OWN BEST
SPOKESPERSON.
>> NO QUESTION HE IS HIS OWN
BEST SPOKESPERSON.
HE CARRIES A MESSAGE AND
UNCONVENTIONAL.
PEOPLE ARE SICK AND TIRED OF
CONVENTIONAL.
PERFECTLY MANICURED AND
REHEARSED AND VETTED BY 14
LURKS LAWYERS.
HE WILL GO AND SPEAK OF 00
CUFF.
ONCE IN A WHILE HE WON'T BE
POLITICALLY CORRECT.
STEVE: HE WILL TAKE
QUESTIONS FROM EVERYBODY IN
THE ROOM.
>> THAT'S WHY PEOPLE TUNE IN
AND LOVE HIM.
PEOPLE DON'T LIKE THE OLD
SCHOOL POLITICIANS.
I HOPE IF THERE IS ONE THING
THAT COMES OUT OF, YOU KNOW,
THIS FOUR YEARS AND WE'RE
GOING TO WIN THIS THING
AGAIN YOU MARK MY WORDS.
BUT I HOPE IT PROMPTS
CIVILIANS, BUSINESS PEOPLE,
YOU KNOW, PEOPLE THAT CAN DO
GREAT THINGS FOR THIS
COUNTRY TO RUN BECAUSE YOU
SEE WHAT CAN BE ACCOMPLISHED
UNDER A GOOD LEADER,
SOMEBODY WHO IS EFFECTIVE.
STEVE: LOOK WHAT HAPPENED TO
KAVANAUGH?
BRIAN: AND LOOK WHAT'S
HAPPENED TO EVERYBODY
AROUND -- A LOOKOUT OF THE
PEOPLE PAID THE PRICE FOR
THE PRESIDENT'S SUCCESS.
>> YEAH, THEY DO IT FOR THE
BENEFIT OF THIS COUNTRY.
THEY DO IT FOR THE BENEFIT
OF THIS COUNTRY.
WE HAVE BEEN -- WE HAVE ALL
BEEN ON THE FIRING LINE.
WE ALL LOVE THE COUNTRY AND
IT'S ABSOLUTELY WORTH IT
WHEN YOU SEE EVERY MARKET
RAGING.
WHEN YOU SEE A SAFER
COUNTRY.
WHEN YOU SEE OPIOID CRISIS
BEING TAKEN CARE OF.
WHEN YOU SEE TAXES GOING
DOWN.
WHEN YOU SEE FACTORIES
OPENING BACK UM.
FOR ALL OF US IT'S A SMALL
PRICE TO PAY ARE TO THE
SUCCESS OF AMERICA.
BRIAN: ERIC DOESN'T WANT ME
TO BRING IT UP PUBLICLY.
A LITTLE UPSET CLEAR BARREN
WILL BE THE TALLEST IN THE
FAMILY.
>> BARREN WILL ABSOLUTELY BE
THE TALLEST.
I'M 6'5".
I'M NO SHRIMP.
BARRON WILL DWARF ME.
AINSLEY: HOW TALL IS HE NOW?
BRIAN: IS HE LIKE 6-FOOT.
>> IS HE A GREAT GUY.
A GREAT KID AND GREAT SOCCER
PLAYER AND GREAT LITTLE
GOLFER.
IS HE TURNING OUT TO BE A
GOOD LITTLE MAN.
