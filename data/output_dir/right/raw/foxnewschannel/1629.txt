2
00:00:07,151 --> 00:00:08,819
>> Tucker: WELL, THERE IS SO

3
00:00:08,819 --> 00:00:11,522
MUCH GOING ON IN THE NEWS IN THE

4
00:00:11,522 --> 00:00:13,524
PAST YEAR AND HALF.

5
00:00:13,524 --> 00:00:15,726
BASIC QUESTIONS HAVEN'T BEEN

6
00:00:15,726 --> 00:00:18,295
ASKED LET ALONE ANSWERS.

7
00:00:18,295 --> 00:00:21,365
WHY DID VOTERS ELECT PRESIDENT

8
00:00:21,365 --> 00:00:22,933
TRUMP AS PRESIDENT.

9
00:00:22,933 --> 00:00:26,003
IT WAS NOT THAT THEY DIDN'T

10
00:00:26,003 --> 00:00:26,770
KNOW.

11
00:00:26,770 --> 00:00:28,505
TRUMP GOT ELECTED BECAUSE PEOPLE

12
00:00:28,505 --> 00:00:31,308
IN CHARGE OF THE COUNTRY WERE

13
00:00:31,308 --> 00:00:33,043
DOING A TERRIBLE JOB.

14
00:00:33,043 --> 00:00:35,379
BIG BUSINESS AND POLITICIAN AND

15
00:00:35,379 --> 00:00:38,249
MEDIA WERE ALL ON THE SAME SIDE

16
00:00:38,249 --> 00:00:41,385
AND THEY GOT RICH AND AMERICA

17
00:00:41,385 --> 00:00:43,821
MOVED BACK WARD.

18
00:00:43,821 --> 00:00:45,889
THERE WAS A THROBBING MIDDLE

19
00:00:45,889 --> 00:00:47,124
FINGER IN THE FACE.

20
00:00:47,124 --> 00:00:50,995
THEY DON'T UNDERSTAND THAT.

21
00:00:50,995 --> 00:00:53,998
AND TO HELP UNDERSTAND HOW BADLY

22
00:00:53,998 --> 00:00:56,166
THEY SHAFTED THE COUNTRY.

23
00:00:56,166 --> 00:00:59,503
HOW A SELFISH RULING CLASS IS

24
00:00:59,503 --> 00:01:00,504
BRINGING AMERICA TO

25
00:01:00,504 --> 00:01:02,172
A REVOLUTION.

26
00:01:02,172 --> 00:01:04,474
IT IS AVAILABLE FOR PREORDER.

27
00:01:04,474 --> 00:01:06,443
WE'LL TALK ABOUT IT UNTIL THEN

28
00:01:06,443 --> 00:01:08,846
BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT THE SHOW IS

29
00:01:08,846 --> 00:01:12,182
ABOUT AND HAS BEEN B. I HOPE YOU

30
00:01:12,182 --> 00:01:15,519
ENJOY THE BOOK AND SHOW.

31
00:01:15,519 --> 00:01:18,989
THINK ABOUT BOOK ASIDE.

32
00:01:18,989 --> 00:01:23,494
THE ELECTION HAPPENS THAT NO ONE

33
00:01:23,494 --> 00:01:24,728
PREDICTED AND NO ONE BOTHERS TO

34
00:01:24,728 --> 00:00:00,000
THINK THROUGH WHY IT HAPPENED.
