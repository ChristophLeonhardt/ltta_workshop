here's a bizarre true story Berkeley radio station KPFA has canceled an interview with scientist Richard Dawkins because they say Dawkins has offended Muslims Dawkins as you know as an evolutionary biologist too became famous for being an atheist he claims that evolutionary theory proves beyond a shadow of a doubt that creation is a random process without purpose or meaning and that that's why he's so depressed and nasty all the time Dawkins has called faith quote one of the world's great evils unquote because it causes people to hate one another instead of loving one another as the Bible tells us - he says that Jesus were alive today he would not believe in himself but would tell everyone that he did not exist ok and made that last part up but it makes as much sense as the rest of what Dawkins believes anyway and his attacks on all religion Dawkins has included attacks on Islam and has criticized the Quranic verses that command Muslims to slaughter everyone on earth so that God can ultimately have the planet to himself to use as a summer vacation spot in Berkeley however this is an atheist step too far it was ok for Dawkins to criticize Judaism in Christianity which are offensive faiths because they created the values of freedom and equality that have oppressed minorities gays and women by not giving them the freedom and equality created by Judaism and Christianity but to criticize Islam which demands the destruction of minorities and gays and the virtual enslavement of women is a violation of the tolerance demanded by Judaism and Christianity which are evil because ok wait I've lost the Train of the slot let me try again you see KPFA in Berkeley is tolerant a uniquely judeo-christian value but they're not tolerant of judeo-christianity because it's intolerant unlike judeo-christianity they are however tolerant of Islam which is intolerant of those who don't believe in Islam because what could be more tolerant than being tolerant of complete intolerance but simply it is now forbidden to speak your mind in Berkeley California if you believe in something that offends those who believe in something else of course offend you because of their beliefs and are therefore forbidden to speak in Berkeley California thus KPFA invited Dawkins to speak because he believes in nothing but then they found out that believing in nothing offends people who believe in something because they believe in something and not nothing so best to say nothing which of course is saying something which offends those who believe in nothing so say nothing which offends those who say something thus anyone who is intolerant of anything is forbidden to speak in Berkeley because Berkeley is intolerant of everything and so Richard Dawkins had to be silenced Muslims responded to the news by issuing a statement saying everyone involved should be killed trigger warning i'm andrew Clavin and this is the andrew Clavin show all right here we are so let's already is the Clavin this weekend is past this week went flying by and this show will go flying because all we're going to do is talk about sex sex sex sex I know Matt I first time got to see man I feel like a woman and then see if I get kicked out of the military we have Patrick off you know yesterday I said Patrick Hoffman was a priest he is not a priest he's kind of a Catholic answer man he was he is the host of the podcast the Patrick coffin show which features weekly interviews with a-list influencers and outliers in the effort to recover the judeo-christian roots of the culture I was on the show kept you all a less people that most of them are ageless people but anyway he has written this book sex Oh natural what it is and why it's good for your marriage so Patrick Hoffman will join us later and you know we'll obviously be talking about the trans sexual ban in the military my favorite story actually is this Hillary Clinton book Hillary Clinton's tell-all book about the election is coming out and it's called what happened it's going to be like Knowles's but it's going to have two words in it I lost it if you stress out I lost for 800 pages all right but first let's talk about shaving that's on I know something about in fact there is no man alive who knows more about shaving than I do because I feel a lot of real estate that I have to shave I mean I go over my entire head every day it's like a 15 minute job and I want it you know I just wanted to be a good experience long long before I had this show maybe I don't know even a year before I had this show and certainly before they were sponsored I was part of the Dollar Shave Club and had been for the last three or four years it's only been around for five years I heard about it on the radio myself and I just thought you know I'm so tired first of all I'm tired of shelling out for these disposable razors they're so expensive and you go to the drugstore and they lock them up because they're afraid people are going to steal them so you have to call somebody to get a razor out and then you know when they run out that you start to slice your head off you know because they're too expensive to replace all the time and if you're doing what I'm doing where you got to shave all these nooks and crannies not this stuff you know they start to cut you up so this is a smarter choice the Dollar Shave Club which is dollarshaveclub.com is a smarter choice because what they do is they send you the razors by the month and you can choose whether you get just a double razor or triple I have two I actually have two they give you different stems handles for them and I actually have two different handles because the you know higher up razors the ones with more blades give you a closer shave but I get a little bit more agility with the smaller ones and they get me into all those strange places that you've got to shave if you shave your head so it's like this is real and they have all this other stuff they got shaved butter I love the shave butter they also have hair stuff I know nothing about this but trust it's as good as everything else it does not something I know about but it really is easy to sign on they say just come every month if you want to stop for a month because you have too many you can just tell them wait until the next month it's really a good a good service it really works like I said I've been using it long long before they became sponsors and for a limited time new members get their first month of the executive razor with a tube of dr. Carver shea butter which really is cool it really as good as this actually I thought it was better than shaving cream it's only five dollars with Free Shipping and after that razors are just a few bucks a month that's a $15 value for only five bucks if you sign up now and in your first month box you get an awesome week handle a full cassette of four cartridges and a tube of the shave butter and after your first month replacement cartridges ship automatically at their regular price there are no hidden fees and no commitments you can cancel anytime you like and like I said if you just don't want them that month you can skip a month or whatever you wanted really it's just it's the easiest way to do this and it's not just that it's cheaper it's a lot cheaper than buying throwaway razors but it's not just that it's a lot cheaper these are also better razors and you can change them once a week you can afford to change them once a week so you always have a good one you can only get this offer exclusively a dollar shave club comm slash Clavin that's dollarshaveclub.com slash Clavin which is spelled que la vie a n dollarshaveclub.com slash Clavin and you will get this excellent deal $15 value for only five bucks shave butter and the blaze try it out like I said I've been using it for years and years so Trent this is this is an incredible story this transgender story and is obviously a lot of different angles about it because Trump Trump is like the master of chaos he just like this everything in this way that creates the maximum amount of chaos oh he tweets out you know madis was had said that he wanted to take a look at this idea of letting transgenders into the military and he said who's going to look at it for six months they were going to ban it or they didn't know they were going to ban it and suddenly without informing the Pentagon apparently Trump just tweets out the commander in chief just tweets out after consultation with my generals and military experts please be advised that the United States government will not accept or allow that was the first tweet and this is a baws transgender individuals to serve in any capacity in the US military our military must be focused on decisive and overwhelming victory and cannot be burdened with the tremendous medical cost and disruption of the transgender in the military would entail thank you this is the first thing I thought about was corporal Klinger does anybody remember corporal Klinger remember the TV show mash Jeff it was about the mash unit in Korean War and corporal Klinger wanted to get with the military so badly that he would always wear a dress because that would be that would be a sign that he was a psychological problem this is what Donald seems like this that Donald Trump is trying to prevent what are you doing Cruz oh yeah a guy have a wash and set without somebody fighting him on it next I was guarding you know your work you're biting me cleaner what are you doing in here just power tool your shampoo major it's war time we all gotta help each other oh we don't you get out of here you pervert pervert who bit who major this has got to stop this has got to stop so anyway I mean Trump this was like the rollout of that anti immigration thing you know the remember the travel ban remember the chaos that he caused with this and it's really funny because with Trump at this point there is so much chaos I'm just to deal with the chaos part of it first there's there's so much chaos that people have begun to think that it's kind of like a strategy you know I mean here's Sheldon Whitehouse senator very very liberal senator and he just says this is a distraction doesn't have the aura of seriousness it looks like he's trying to throw yet another shiny object out there to distract people from what's going on with Russia and as usual when he throws the shiny object he figures out a group that he thinks is vulnerable and just tries to be mean to them yeah so he's trying to distract from the Russia investigation but that is actually continuing here is you are all hereby found guilty of the crime of witchcraft I said a few hacks to be burned at the stake until you are deemed fit to reenter society that's obviously Teddy Kennedy came back to life to do though it's a which on to get it to get it it's the widget so anyway let me here's the thing about this this is this is many things but it is not a civil rights issue it has nothing to do with civil rights it has nothing to do with transgenderism right or wrong none of this matters said when he was in this hearing he didn't care who slept with whom it has absolutely nothing to do with it the you know one of one of the problems we have in America really is a problem it's like one of those upset what they call an up-down problem or actually what they call now a white girl problem because they there's a problem it's an easy problem it's because we are so far away from questions of survival of questions of necessity we are so rich so well protected that we have these conversations in a bubble of protected fantasy where we don't we're not even talking about what we're talking about so people are saying oh it's a you know it's a civil rights that poor transgender person I mean it has nothing absolutely nothing to do with this you know it really is amazing what they always do they always do this on television especially but actually this is the news media the left-wing news media it's all it is they bring on individuals individuals who let's say in this case they brought on transgender sila trend the Canadian Broadcasting Company I just use this because it I know it's Canada but it's typical they bring in a Rachael Clarke a transgender marine okay and here's the the anchorwoman introducing this just listen to this few seconds Rachael Clarke is a transgender activist who served in the US Marine Corps she joins me now in studio thanks so much for coming in today thanks for having me first of all I want to get your impressions of this policy how does this policy make you feel hmm cares who cares how this policy makes anybody feel okay we are talking about this in this protected bubble that our military has created our wealth has created our food and abundance is created where we forget what it is we're doing the military is there to kill people and break things it is there to keep us alive it is there so you can go to the Opera it's there so you can go into your protest march against the military and say how bad the military is they are there to protect you while you're doing that because if they're not there we know for a fact if they're not there it's like removing all the pawns on a game of chess they will just come down and take you away you will be gone the next day I've always thought whenever whenever they say whenever a college says you know we're not going to have ROTC or whenever a state says you know we're not going to support the military I always think ok let's withdraw military protection from that state let's not just California how about UC Berkeley doesn't have military protection anymore they would be UC Berkeley for one minute so we're talking about survival even though we're so safe it doesn't seem like a survival there are a million things that will keep you out of the military and eating disorder if you have ADHD that can keep you out of the military if you have mood disorder any kind of depression and the thing first of all we don't know anything about we don't know enough about transgenderism is is it in and of itself a mental disorder there's plenty of reason to say that but we know it is attended by laughs and loss of mental disorders much higher rate of depression much higher rate of suicides I think the suicide attempt rate is up around 40% for transgender much greater rate of substance abuse the only question here is whether it makes it tougher for the military to do its job of killing people that is their job their job is to go out find our enemies meet them say hello and then kill them that's their job and anything that gets in the way I am against women in combat I am definitely against women in combat situations they get hurt more they're not as good at shooting they're not as they haven't got the endurance that men have they destroy they weaken the unit Cohiba they call unit cohesion the togetherness of the people you know I don't care if it's unfair I don't care if it's unfair the idea of the military is not to be fair there are no civil rights issues in the military the only issue in the military is can they kill enough people to keep the rest of us a lot can they kill enough bad guys to keep the good guys alive can they be scary and mean and big and tough and ugly and uninformative all and keep alive and you know everything about the way these debates are formed is meant to keep you from thinking about the truth here's here's George Stephanopoulos introduction to his report on this just watch the way this is reported now to the backlash over president Trump's ban on transgender service in the US military take a look at these images right here protests breaking out across the country after the president tweeted his decision to ban transgender individuals from serving in quote any capacity the policy President Trump is reversing was just announced last year by President Obama's administration and now the future of those currently serving our country is in question this wasn't abrupt move by president sharp II promise during the campaign that he will be stronger on LGBT rights and Hillary Clinton it's like how many lies and deceptions and distractions can you back in to a 15-second open you know I mean that's really what it is right I got to stop and say goodbye to Facebook and YouTube which means should we can we stay on through Facebook and YouTube let's stay on because I want you to listen to Patrick often really interesting because you wrote this book sex or natural a book by the way I mean I'm very liberal about sexual issues for a number of reasons that we'll discuss but I wonder when I bring on guests I want to hear what they have to say and this is a very very intense Catholic take on sex and marriage and what it should be like really interesting well-written good read sex or natural by what what it is and why it's good for your marriage by Patrick Hoffman so he we will be talking to him and we'll stay on but but just because we're staying on that doesn't mean that you shouldn't subscribe you should subscribe to The Daily wire calm it's a lousy ten bucks a month for a hundred bucks to get a year's subscription plus the leftist tears mug come on come on I left the stairs my plus you can be in the mail bag we had the mail bag yesterday you know my wife my wife said she didn't understand my discussion of basically a platonic forms and why did I lose people there I don't know yeah so if you followed it my god alright but I tried I tried you have to you know you have to it is tough philosophy but I did I what I was saying was right I may not have described as well as I could all right so the thing about all of this that is really interesting is that because we can't this is why we can't have nice things in this country we have you know if you watch the show business reaction to the transgender thing it was all the same there's a few you know Stephen Colbert comes out says F you and then the audience like trained monkeys they really are at this point like trained monkeys when I say if you are cheer and yell because now we know what this is what we you know it is like if they didn't have the F word these guys their entire senses of humor would disappear I think Samantha Beats we did the same thing oh yeah Trump well you know it's like an entire industry an entire industry geared toward keeping us away from discussing the issues like adults turning it into a personal matter bringing on people who might shed a little too you know like oh I'm so sad that the transgender people can't be in the military and not discussing it hey I would listen to a discussion you know there was a rand study the rand is a big corporation studies all these military things and they said you know they just aren't that many transgenders in the military the car and most of them don't want reassignment surgery as they call it so it's not a big deal you know I would have that debate and I have to people have that debate the other side said it doesn't matter it's bad for unit cohesion transgenders of course can still serve in the military they just what they can't do is they can't come out and say I'm transgender and I want to have surgery and you should pay for it so that's that's the only difference I am actually in favor of the military doing whatever it has has to do to be as lethal and terrifying and murderous as it can possibly be that is what I want and to use it as a as the frontline of social justice warrior experimenting seems to be inherently stupid but let's have that debate let's have that debate you know instead of these guys just bringing on individuals it's all about distraction and you know you talk about you talk about Donald Trump distracting people and using issues to throw people off and maybe he is you know there was there was an exchange on the Bret bear show on special report really got to me you know because I've been talking a lot about the fact that you know that obviously they're debating in the Senate the health care bill and they voted down straight repeal which really was shameful especially from the lady from Murkowski from Alaska she's been parading her anti Obamacare credentials for years and just putting out press releases about and she then she voted down a repeal bill a straight repeal bill but there it is they got to go through their debate they got to go through the whole show they're going to vote on all the amendments and and I was saying that Trump has a chance to have a real victory here but he's distracting everybody with this Jeff Sessions thing that he's always attacking Jeff Sessions and now distracting people with the transgender thing and Bret Baier had the panel on at the end of the Bret Baier show they have that panel and Charles Krauthammer this brilliant guy is there and bear says to him is it possible that all of this is three-dimensional chess essentially he says to him you know for the Democrats were attacking Jeff Sessions and now the Trump is attacking them they are defending him you know and he asks chakra hammer and he played this clip of dick Durbin senator dick durbin senator angus King and you'll hear them first attacking when when he was up from sessions was up for confirmation they were attacking him and then praising him and defending him from being mr. Trump the wrong person for this job we need someone with unquestioned strength in values and integrity Jeff Sessions stuck his neck out for this president the only the first senator to endorse him and now look at the president's doing to him chopping his head off because of his relationship with mr. Trump and his history I'm just not sure he would give the kind of independent advice that this president desperately needs when you take the oath in this country you your oh this to the Constitution you don't say I promise to be loyal and support the president and I say so so bear plays these two cuts and he says to Krauthammer is is Trump just playing this game to get the Democrats to suddenly support Jeff Sessions they that is the three-dimensional chess theory of Donald Trump that everything he does has these incredibly clever motives and Krauthammer I won't play the Krauthammer cup but he basically just couldn't he didn't even hear the question you know I mean he's a brilliant guy and he said he said yes the Democrats are hypocrites they don't believe in anything they will say anything but that's a different issue but what Baer was asking him about was was Trump using that to his advantage and the question with the transgender thing is the same thing there's some theory that Republicans came to him and said they wouldn't pass his spending bill that includes spending to build the border wall if he didn't do something about this and so maybe he did it for that reason but there's so much chaos in Washington but the only thing I want to point out the only thing I want to point out is if Trump is a disinformation esteem edia is to the media are to the news media has been doing this for years when you bring on oh here's a transgender seal here's a transgender marine when you don't bring on people to discuss the actual issues it is all geared toward violating you through your emotions and then and then you watch the news and then you stay up late and you watch Stephen Colbert and he says f you president Trump in every year it is all geared to manipulation it is all geared to not having the discussion that we are supposed to have but let us have the discussion with Patrick coffin he is the author of sex o naturelle I got to get this subtitle what it is and why it's good for your marriage he was he was on the for years for eight years he was on the top rated Catholic Answers live apologetics radio program you can find him now Patrick coffin dotnet there's a podcast there and on YouTube it's Patrick coffin media Patrick either than you are how you doing hey I'm doing great Andrew is just filling out a few platonic forms I really I have to apologize for a point for promoting you to priests yesterday all happen all the time i natural grace and you know pope francis just this morning told me that name-dropping is totally inappropriate he called me he said i you know you wanted me to make you a priest but i'm the only one who hasn't called so so to start out with i am fairly liberal live-and-let-live don't scare the horses about sexual issues at the same time I do look at some of this transgender stuff and when I see people in mainstream venues recommending that you butcher your children you know if a little Timmy plays with a doll cut him to pieces and inject him with hormones you know I see this and I do have this sense that the left at least or a strong a large portion of blood has gone insane on sexual matters and there does there is this feeling of that people have lost their minds on this question of sex and I would like to know before we start talking about the book which we will but I would like to know what where do you think this starts why do you think this is has sponge so far out of control the that's the question to be to be asked and framed and I appreciate your time I hear on the show and Rove's delighted to have you in mind so this is a lot of fun so thank you I think we need to take a look from 50,000 feet above the tarmac and go back to the summer of 1930 in 1930 in August the Anglican bishops met and as Anglican bishops do they they produced a document that not a lot of people paid attention to but it did include one reference to contraception and at that Lambeth conference in 1930 for the very first time in all of Christian history their excellencies made an exception only within marriage and only in extreme extraordinary circumstances could a man a woman prevent the coming to be of a new human being well within ten years all of mainline old-line Protestantism had had collapsed and that the this deep fissure within the Christian world began so where's this going well with the acceptance of the divorce between love and life which is represented by contraception the logic there is inexorable it's going to catch up with you if it's okay to thwart the act by which new human life is created then all bets are off in fact Sigmund Freud noted this in 1920 gave a lecture in Vienna but you can look up it's in a collection of his his talks and he says it's the mark of sexual perversion that it sets aside reproduction as an aim so Freud last night I saw that I saw this in the book in sexual natural I saw it in the book and I was stunned the voices it yeah and so did Mahatma Gandhi in the in the 20s was saying the same thing the contraception was going to reap a whirlwind of abusive toward women it would increase bust in the world it would see women as instruments for men's pleasure and they would be begin to be used and so once you take apart that most fundamental aspect of what a human person is you know we're we're built to be with others and the ultimate inbuilt union is between a man and a woman through sexual union and this is why our genitals are called genitals they generate new life so we say you know kind of casually Oh a human life is sacred if that's true then the means of transmitting that life isn't also some sense sacred so once you disassemble of such a basic building block of human life then of course you're going to you're going to challenge other basics like what's my sex what's my gender can I can I go from one to the other what will be wrong with with any kind of sexual Union and so now you have five hundred thousand or so polyamorous couples they want the you know the definition of marriage to extend to polyamorous couples there's groups in Canada and in in the Netherlands that want to remove the taboos toward bestiality I'm not making this up yes the headlines now used to be called onion parity headline so I think the trans confusion which by the way afflicts about a third of a percent yes that's not in population so when when the celebrities have this you know collective paroxysm of nausea at president Trump's very sensible policy the numbers don't bear the the emoting I in a very very small sliver now let me ask you this because I mean you must know that in the world today you actually sound what you're saying is radical I mean most people would look at you especially people who are younger you know and grew up with birth control as a just a natural thing that was there they're going to look at you and you say you're radical so let's for the sake of argument let's let's eliminate the extremes for a minute let's eliminate chair phrases and just say well what's wrong with you know gay people being free what's wrong with people having a few sexual encounters that don't produce children before they get married what is wrong with the the freedom that that birth control provides and that the new sexual freedom provides well the freedom mantra is the main slogan by which birth control was sold in the 60s it was going to usher in a new era of freedom that women would would be able to pursue whatever they wanted and marriages would become happy and people would be quote unquote free no one ever defines freedom anymore and not only do they not define the thing they think it's going to make them happy the things nowadays don't have any meanings you know sex doesn't have a meaning anymore even the fact that we're having this conversation is probably looked at as odd by some bizarre ya know some of the stuff you're saying I know sounds bizarre door younger people right but but let's look let's look at a different body part let's take it out of the sexual realm altogether the eyes are made for something an atheist has to admit that there's an inbuilt purpose to the human eye it's to see things especially beautiful things the ears have a purpose it's to hear things especially words like I love you the lungs have a purpose it's to oxygenate blood the heart has a purpose to pump blood through the body so if you damage your eyes that's wrong because your eyes have an inbuilt purpose you are undermining the purpose for which the thing is made the great Thomas Aquinas said that you can't know what a thing is until you know what it's for so if you want to remove nails you reach for a hammer because that's what the Hammers for so this is obviously you can see where the spear is going to land translating this line of thinking into the sexual sphere means that sex has a purpose and any educated twelve-year-old knows what that purpose is it's twofold as dr. Jana Smith says sex is for babies and for bonding babies and bonding now can have other purposes for instance a couple a couple can get married at the age of 89 and so the procreative aspect is not going to be in play there but they're not undermining they're not supporting it and that's the heart of contraception contraception actually andrew has nothing to do with sex per se if I'm an evil mayor and I want to control the population of my town I could add a additive into the water that would sterilize the men I would be the contracept in that town because I would be undermining sexual acts in this case wouldn't be mine would be the citizens does that make sense yeah I know I see what you're saying I have a couple of questions that immediately spring to mind I want to put them put them before you so that people don't feel that they weren't addressed what about you you said that some somebody could have had you know an older marriage could have what about the fact that there that even though things have uses sometimes creative people find other uses for them my feet are for standing and walking but gymnast hang by them when they are doing that you know when they're doing their routines we have we find medicines that were created for one thing but can be used for another obviously people get a lot of fun out of sex and in the context of marriage it especially where you're you know you're not spreading disease and you're not destroying people's lives what is wrong with doing things that having sexual acts that turn you on but don't have the possibility of creating life well that is a it's a box with the word Pandora on the side because where does it where does it end where does that line of thinking get you it gets you unable to oppose any kind of sexual Union for instance what would be wrong with sex with a goat by saying that people you know he's he's insane he just does the word goat in here but if if reproduction is set aside as a name then all bets are off why couldn't anybody at any time for any reason just masturbate all day or why couldn't they lust after someone else's not their spouse well see it's not that there's only one purpose in fact there's comfort obviously this pleasure there's union there's relief they're all those things but the thing that makes it what it is it's inbuilt purpose I've even brought God into it the thing that makes it what it is is the possibility of new human life and the union of a man and a woman because otherwise without contraception you have no pornography industry if you look at the mainstream ization of porn it began post 1965 tonight before 1965 it was illegal to sell or advertised contraceptives in the United States and the Griswold versus Connecticut decision produced this penumbra as the justices of roe v wade said known as the right to privacy so when the right to privacy was introduced into American life well obviously if sex is shorn from conception why can't you masturbate why why do we have to have a point industry stuck in one part of the town and so you have the introduction of pubic hair in 1969 in Playboy and within years a couple years anyway you've got a whole industry of glossy magazines that did not exist ten years prior but and now I mean the whole world's pornified and that's that was given jet fuel by the contraceptive mentality that sex is for whatever I wanted to be for there's no question that the world is pornified I have to say that even I who like don't pay attention to this I've walked down the streets of New York and I start to think like God but something but there's something buzzing in my head what is it is that every poster has a naked woman on it as you're walking along and it gets you it gets into your mind but but there does seem to be I mean you put a couple of things together they're like having sex with a goat which seems to me wrong because the goat has no say hey you know the goat has no will in the act so it's kind of you're raping an animal but then you talk about masturbation I think well you know that what business is that of mine how you talk about even when it comes to a loving relationship between two gay people you say well what are they doing wrong I mean who was a harmony and I guess I guess that that's where that is that is the question in a free society that keeps coming up and that keeps you know the way the way the news media keeps from discussing this is appealing to that sense of freedom that Americans love so much so that we don't discuss these kind of issues that you're discussing right now so what is what is wrong with an act that doesn't hurt anybody and and is done with consent that's a very good question and I think sometimes some forms of harm are hard to prove they're hard data actually they're even hard to admit I've learned a lot from a guy named Joseph shaumbra Joseph shaumbra is an ex gay porn star it's a really dark satanic activity the full Castro San Francisco life and he left it and he writes about the harm that that whole scene brought in the lives of not just him but the many friends that he had had in the past because they passed away from from AIDS so I think I think it depends on who you're paying attention to you about what harm sexual misbehavior can can bring to someone and let's face it God is a genius sex feels really really good again oh god he hasn't put redundant things in there in fact the very first commandment I'd say this in the book sex unnatural the first commandment was not I'm the Lord your God you shall have no other gods beside me the first commandment is in Genesis chapter 1 verse 27 do it he's fruitful and multiply still not partially fill the earth and multiply and then you said it again - no and Genesis 9 says it again in Genesis chapter 35 so God's pro-sex definitely and so we're prone to Auto Kittery okay we're all we all do this because we because we want what its pleasures bring us we don't want anything that's going to impede what I want for myself right now and I admit that some of the harms here are difficult to discern because we have a vested interest in not wanting to look at it because it's so pleasurable and so immediate well then let's put it in the positive side and again the book is sex so natural what it is and why it's good for your marriage when you sex with natural is basically well I should let you define it sure what does that mean exactly I stole it without shame but I admitted it and it's in the intro it's a it's a line from federico matthew screen who's an orthodox writer and NPR commentator and the French term unnatural is is a kind of a poetic way of saying nude you're naked let's get you know they stay swam oh naturellement they skinny-dipped so sex so natural is sex without the intrusion of any chemical of any barrier of any withdrawal of any truncation of what it means and that's the heart of the biblical ancient Christian insight into sexual intercourse because sexual intercourse is what it is whether or not it produces children you know if I if I playing baseball and I see the pitch coming in from the pitcher and I swing just because I didn't connect and hit a homerun doesn't mean I wasn't doing the baseball thing so there's that there's a meaning in itself to sexual intercourse and sex on that URL is a is my witty way of summarizing that sexually and it should be truly romantic and without the fear-based language of protection which is the heart of contraception okay - I have two loves questions one is that I meant to ask one of the my men to ask you before and I'd slipped my mind what about the objection that you look in so many places where people don't have a lot of money and they you know a sex is one of their main forms of you know condolence and entertainment and they have too many kids and they can't afford the kids it becomes a juvie obscure situation you know we are too many what do you say to them I mean what is the Catholic Church or or you personally have to say to them well the church does not condemn spacing your birds yeah every month the woman is fertile for one day the day of ovulation and if you if you have a grave reason we're serious or just reason to delay pregnancy even indefinitely prints in the case of a medical condition that might make pregnancy dangerous you can avoid intercourse on those days it's called natural family planning and it's ninety-eight percent plus effective in preventing pregnancy but what you're never doing is you're never interrupting the meaning of sex itself you're simply expressing your love in a non genital way I'm go ahead okay I mean oh I get I get the answer I'm running out of time and I was the last thing I want to ask you is why is this good for your mouth oh it's good for your marriage because couples who contracept can much more easily hide behind sex they can throw sex at a problem if you're not using contraception so you have no birth and no control which is what really the the hidden meaning of the phrase birth control subscribe it's a if that phrase came from Margaret Sanger by the way the brilliant polemicist and propagandist so with no birth and no control it's just the adventure of of true love and every month you have this conversation with your spouse are we ready for a new a new baby what would a new baby look like in this house we already have too much chaos we got three kids forget Oh Cisco for for couples who use natural family planning have a very close to zero divorce rate this was verified by Robert Lerner of the University of Chicago dr. Joseph wrote sir tract 1,400 couples over 20 years who all had one thing in common they used natural family planning to space their births over 20 years 1,400 couples had a zero divorce rate school so it has a data-driven success for marital longevity and happiness Patrick thank you very much for coming on this is really a really interesting people can find you at Patrick coffin net and Patrick coffin media anywhere else they can find you correct dotnet is where they can get a signed copy this week is the anniversary of human ivj which is the 1968 encyclical on this whole matter very short and so if you go to the net site Patricof and net and when you get to the checkout the coupon h v 4q money bt h v 20 gets you 20% off and I'll even sign it and for an extra PL sign at Andrew Clavin actually it's great talking you I hope you'll come back so I was on after L really interesting book and a good read thanks for coming on all right thanks a lot man appreciate it uh alright really interesting tonight you know I mean I just I I have this thing that I've been wrestling with about this the the issue because you know when Patrick talks about he was talking about some of the stuff that we talked about here which is teleology the purpose of things the reason for things and this and this is where the natural law of this Catholic Church comes from and the natural law of thinkers throughout the Western tradition I have some problems with it I have some problems with it it seems to me a gay guy in a straight marriage is being untrue to something in himself even though he is also deviating from what he's talking about the purpose of sexuality and it seems to me that a couple married couple who enjoy doing things that don't lead to procreation or just cementing a bond between two people which i think is you know a pleasure and a delight and shouldn't be wanted by guilt i mean these are these are things that seem to me to have they have a new way of addressing natural law that takes into account individualism that is kind of what i'm looking for stuff i like i got to talk about stuff i like you know i have given two standing ovations in my life one of the things in the theatre now it's like people give standing ovations to anything you know they just stand up for every single but anything's like dude you know it's like getting an a-plus that every says like a trophy for trying you know I have given to I love the theater I'm in the theater a lot I go to the theater a lot I've given to standing ovations in my life one of them was to Sweeney Todd when I first saw Sweeney Todd with Angela Lansbury and who was Lynne Kerry who's now the grandfather on Blue Bloods Len Carey oh and Angela Lansbury the first cast on Broadway I saw Sweeney Todd the Demon Barber of Fleet Street by Stephen Sondheim of a book by Hugh wheeler just a brilliant brilliant musical and grim and dark and evil as it can possibly be the movie doesn't do it justice but here is my favorite and possibly one of my favorite songs ever pretty women and then we'll come back and say goodbye awesome fascinating sipping coffee dancing pretty women are Oh wonder pretty women I'm sitting in the window war standing on Thursday something in them within for everything like pretty women pretty women blowing out we're coming up yeah even what that is I love that song man I touch pretty women how they make a man sing proof of heaven while you're living it's great stuff the Clavin list weekend begins I'm sorry to say it who knows who's going to get through this one is can we go ahead and with so much chaos none of us may make it back but if we do survivors gather here on Monday I'm Andrew Clavin this is the Andrew Clavin show
