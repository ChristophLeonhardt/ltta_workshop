they're a bunch of top Democrats who attended a Louis Farrakhan speech Jake Tapper over at CNN who I criticized pretty heavily last week for what I thought was an egregious ly awful Town Hall and then I praised this week for doing an interview with the sheriff Scott Israel in parkland Florida he he did a tweet storm yesterday that I think is quite good where he attacked Democrats attacking who attended Lou's Farrakhan speeches an amazing thing that the mainstream media think an utterly not worthy of note that Louis Farrakhan and open anti-semite and open racist then in generalize piece of crap that this guy is treated as a celebrity by so many top-level Democrats including Democrats in the Congressional Black Caucus here are some clips of Louis Farrakhan talking and there were Democrats at the speech top-level Democrats at this speech I don't care what they've put on me the government is my enemy the powerful Jews my enemy okay top-level Democrats have praised Louis Farrakhan they taking pictures of Louis Farrakhan Barack Obama took pictures of the Louis Farrakhan there were two co-sponsors of the women's March were present at this speech at this one right here okay and Democrats apparently had nothing to say about that they will be at the women's March again the radicalism of the Democrats there's a lot of talk about the alt-right in the last election cycle I think it was fully merited I was one of the people doing the talking the Democrats are equally radical when it comes to Lewis Farrakhan maybe a blind spot for anti-semitism so long as that anti-semitism is coming from parts of the community that are not white so here is Lewis Farrakhan doing more of this just really discussing stuff white folks are going down and Satan is going and Farrakhan by God's grace has pulled it off of that seat panic June and I'm here to say your time is up your world is the man's Pig I mean he's just he's one of the worst people on planet Earth hey this is the guy who keith Ellison who could have been the head of the entity was endorsed by Chuck Schumer to be the head of the DNC he was a member of the Nation of Islam he defended Louis Farrakhan for years the Congressional Black Caucus has defended Louis Farrakhan hey the Democrats are so radical that is home likely they would have the brains to actually triangulate with Trump but their radicalism is also they're allowed to get away with it yeah there was a poll yesterday showed 57% of Americans supposedly think Trump is a racist it's like 20% of Republicans in 80 plus percent of Democrats okay how many how many people think that Louis Farrakhan is a racist and therefore the people who associate with him are racist the reason that people think that Trump is racist is because of the associations at the alt-right during the last campaign and some of the comments that he's made well if you're gonna hold the standard that standard has to be held on both sides I don't see a lot of people in the media doing it good on Jake Tapper for doing it
