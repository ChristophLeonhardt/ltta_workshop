PRESIDENT TRUMP: I HAVE GREAT
RESPECT FOR THE PROCESS, BUT IN
ALL FAIRNESS, OBAMA, PRESIDENT
OBAMA --
>>  BOOOOO.
PRESIDENT TRUMP: PAID
1.8 BILLION FOR HOSTAGES.
>>  BOOOO.
PRESIDENT TRUMP: YOU, NOT ME,
YOU LAST NIGHT, YOU SAW IT.
KIM JONG-UN DID A GREAT SERVICE
TO HIMSELF, TO HIS COUNTRY BY
DOING THIS, BUT THOSE HOSTAGES
CAME OUT WITH RESPECT, WE DIDN'T
PAY FOR THEM.
STEVE: JUST SOMETHING THE
PRESIDENT WAS TALKING ABOUT LAST
NIGHT IN INDIANA.
AINSLEY: LET'S BRING IN DIAMOND
& SILK SOCIAL MEDIA STARS AND
TRUMP SUPPORTERS GOOD MORNING
LADIES.
GOOD MORNING.
AINSLEY: HE DID SOMETHING THAT
PRESIDENT OBAMA COULD NEVER DO
HE BROUGHT HOME OUR HOSTAGES FOR
FREE.
>>  WELL YOU KNOW THE PRESIDENT
IS ABSOLUTELY CORRECT.
YOU KNOW, OBAMA PAID BILLIONS
FOR HOSTAGES.
HE TRADED OFF TERRORIST FOR
AMERICAN HOSTAGES BUT PRESIDENT
TRUMP DIDN'T HAVE TO DO THAT.
YOU KNOW, OBAMA I KNOW HE'S
UPSET BECAUSE HE THINKS THAT HIS
LEGACY IS BEING TARNISHED BUT
HIS LEGACY DIDN'T HAVE A LEG TO
STAND ON.
>>  THAT'S RIGHT.
>>  PRESIDENT TRUMP DIDN'T BACK
DOWN AND MINCE HIS WORDS
AND WE HAVE AMERICANS BACK ON
OUR SOIL WHERE THEY BELONG.
PETE: WHY DO YOU BOTH FEEL LIKE
THEY WON'T, SOME OF THE LAST OF
THE SO-CALLED MAINSTREAM MEDIA
STILL WON'T GIVE HIM ANY CREDIT
THEY'RE SAYING THIS APPROACH IN
NORTH KOREA ISN'T GOING TO WORK.
WHY WON'T THEY EVER DO THAT?
>>  BECAUSE THEY'RE JEALOUS,
BECAUSE HE'S BEEN ABLE TO DO
BETWEEN 16 TO 18 MONTHS WHAT
OBAMA COULD NOT DO IN EIGHT
YEARS.
>>  THAT'S RIGHT.
THAT'S WHY THEY WON'T GIVE HIM
CREDIT.
LISTEN THIS PRESIDENT IS NOT TO
BE PLAYED WITH.
THERE'S A NEW SHERIFF IN TOWN WE
CALL HIM PRESIDENT DONALD J.
TRUMP AND HE IS NOT PLAYING.
HE'S GOING TO GET THE JOB DONALD
THEY ARE JEALOUS BECAUSE THEY
COULD NEVER DO THAT.
>>  THAT'S RIGHT.
STEVE: WELL LADIES YOU'RE DOWN
IN WASHINGTON D.C. THIS WEEK
WITH THE CONFIRMATION HEARINGS
FOR GINA HAS PEOPLE TO BE THE
NEXT CIA DIRECTOR, THE WHOLE
CONVERSATION HAS TURNED TO
ENHANCED INTERROGATION AND WATER
BOARDING WHICH NOW THE
GOVERNMENT DOESN'T DO, BUT
LISTEN TO THIS HERE IS WHOOPIE
GOLDBERG YESTERDAY ON THE VIEW
WITH THE PLAN.
>>  REMEMBER HOW THE GENTLEMAN
IN THE WHITE HOUSE TALKED ABOUT
TORTURE ON THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL?
WHAT I'D LIKE TO SAY IS I WOULD
LIKE YOU TO TRY IT.
I THINK PEOPLE WHO HAVE ACTUALLY
BEEN TORTURED, WHO ARE SAYING
THIS IS NOT A GOOD THING, YOU
SHOULD LISTEN TO THEM BECAUSE
YOU HAVE NEVER BEEN TORTURED AND
NEITHER HAS DICK CHENEY.
STEVE: SO WHAT DO YOU THINK?
>>  WELL YOU KNOW, WHY DON'T
WHOOPIE GOLDBERG TRY IT?
>>  THAT'S RIGHT.
>>  SHE NEEDS TO TRY RESPECTING
THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED
STATES IS WHAT SHE NEEDS TO TRY
TO DO.
THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED
STATES IS NOT A TERRORIST.
HE'S AN AMERICAN.
HE'S OUR PRESIDENT, SO WHY WOULD
WE WATERBOARD HIM?
IF SHE WANTS TO TRY WHAT WATER
BOARDING FEELS LIKE WHY
DON'T SHE DO IT?
ANOTHER THING, WHY DON'T SHE
CHAMPION AROUND GINA HASPIL,
BECAUSE WOULDN'T SHE BE THE
FIRST WOMAN IN THIS POSITION SO
YOU SHOULD BE CHAMPIONING AROUND
THIS WOMAN THAT GETS THIS HIGH
POSITION IS WHAT YOU SHOULD BE
DOING.
>>  THAT'S RIGHT.
STEVE: LET'S TALK A LITTLE BIT
ABOUT THE GARDEN STATE, PETE AND
I LIVE THERE AND NOW LADIES AS
IT TURNS OUT WE ARE SUBSIDIZING
THINGS FOR ILLEGAL ALIENS
BECAUSE THE GARDEN STATE IS NOW
ALLOWING FOR ILLEGAL ALIENS TO
APPLY FOR STATE FINANCIAL AID AT
THE UNIVERSITIES AND HERE IS THE
BEST PART, FOR INSTANCE AT
RUTGERS WHICH IS JUST ACROSS THE
RIVER FROM WHERE WE'RE SITTING
DOWN A COUPLE MILES, ILLEGALS
CAN QUALIFY FOR IN-STATE TUITION
NOT IN THE COUNTRY, BUT THEY GET
IN-STATE TUITION.
>>  YOU KNOW, I THINK THAT'S
VERY SAD.
>>  VERY.
AND WE'RE PAYING FOR THIS,
AMERICANS TAX DOLLARS.
WHAT ABOUT THE AMERICAN STUDENTS
WHAT ABOUT AMERICAN PEOPLE THAT
GO TO SCHOOL THAT HAVE TO PAY
STUDENT LOANS UNTIL THEY ARE
ABOUT 60 YEARS OLD?
YES, WE ALLOW PEOPLE TO CROSS
OUR BORDERS ILLEGALLY AND NOW WE
GIVE THEM HAND-OUTS LIKE GRANTS
JUST TO GO TO COLLEGE?
WHAT ABOUT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE I
THINK IT'S SAD, I THINK IT'S
SICK, I THINK EVERY AMERICAN
THAT GOES FOR COLLEGE SHOULD BE
OUTRAGED.
>>  THAT'S RIGHT.
AND THEY COMMITTED THEIR FIRST
CRIME WHENEVER THEY CROSSED THAT
BORDER ILLEGALLY WHEN AN
AMERICAN CITIZEN DO SOMETHING
ILLEGALLY, THEY ARE GIVEN THREE
BEHIND A LOCKED CELL BLOCK, NOT
NO FUNDING.
STEVE: LADIES WHAT ARE YOU DOING
IN WASHINGTON TODAY?
>>  OH, WE WAS IN WASHINGTON FOR
AN EVENT LAST NIGHT WITH SARAH
PALIN.
>>  IT WAS AMAZING.
