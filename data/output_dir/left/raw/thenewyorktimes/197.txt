1
00:00:00,966 --> 00:00:02,850
When North Korea
threatened to back out

2
00:00:02,850 --> 00:00:05,020
of the nuclear summit
with President Trump,

3
00:00:05,020 --> 00:00:08,250
they pointed the finger at
one person — John Bolton —

4
00:00:08,250 --> 00:00:11,310
and blasted his calls for
the so-called Libya model.

5
00:00:11,310 --> 00:00:13,530
Not even Bolton’s
boss is happy with it.

6
00:00:13,530 --> 00:00:16,920
“Well, the Libyan model isn’t
a model that we have at all.”

7
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:19,680
So just what is Bolton’s
so-called Libya model?

8
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:22,500
It started in 2003,
when Libya decided

9
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:25,380
to dismantle its fledgling
nuclear weapons program.

10
00:00:25,380 --> 00:00:29,940
The country even shipped parts
to a warehouse in Tennessee.

11
00:00:29,940 --> 00:00:33,050
“These are aluminum
vacuum tubes in which

12
00:00:33,050 --> 00:00:36,030
the centrifuge machinery
themselves operate.”

13
00:00:36,030 --> 00:00:38,480
And according to John Bolton,
it all went down

14
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:40,050
in one fell swoop.

15
00:00:40,050 --> 00:00:42,270
No half-steps,
no concessions.

16
00:00:42,270 --> 00:00:44,520
His take was that
Muammar Qaddafi simply

17
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:47,220
made a strategic calculation:
Give up the nukes,

18
00:00:47,220 --> 00:00:50,610
and Libya would no
longer be a global pariah —

19
00:00:50,610 --> 00:00:55,130
and avoid the fate of
Saddam Hussein’s Iraq.

20
00:00:55,130 --> 00:00:57,840
What actually happened with
Libya is a matter of debate,

21
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:00,590
but it became Bolton’s go-to
model for how to disarm

22
00:01:00,590 --> 00:01:02,450
rogue states like
North Korea.

23
00:01:02,450 --> 00:01:04,220
“Is it a requirement
that Kim Jong-un

24
00:01:04,220 --> 00:01:06,185
agree to give away
those weapons before

25
00:01:06,185 --> 00:01:08,535
you give any kind
of concession?”

26
00:01:08,535 --> 00:01:09,470
“I think that’s right.

27
00:01:09,470 --> 00:01:13,100
I think we’re looking at the
Libya model of 2003, 2004.”

28
00:01:13,100 --> 00:01:16,460
“The implementation
of the decision

29
00:01:16,460 --> 00:01:18,690
means getting rid of
all the nuclear weapons,

30
00:01:18,690 --> 00:01:22,150
dismantling them, taking
them to Oak Ridge, Tenn.”

31
00:01:22,150 --> 00:01:23,550
Why is Bolton’s
Libya model

32
00:01:23,550 --> 00:01:25,880
so offensive
to North Korea?

33
00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:29,090
First, it’s a dig at the regime’s
crowning achievement.

34
00:01:29,090 --> 00:01:31,110
As the official North Korea
statement says,

35
00:01:31,110 --> 00:01:32,810
'It is absolutely
absurd to compare

36
00:01:32,810 --> 00:01:35,550
North Korea, a nuclear
state, to Libya,

37
00:01:35,550 --> 00:01:39,520
which had been at the initial
state of nuclear development.'

38
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:42,370
It’s true that Libya was
barely a nuclear startup.

39
00:01:42,370 --> 00:01:45,190
And North Korea actually has
warheads, ballistic missiles

40
00:01:45,190 --> 00:01:48,340
and a vast network of labs
and development sites.

41
00:01:48,340 --> 00:01:51,670
Second, North Korea calls
Bolton’s model a “sinister move

42
00:01:51,670 --> 00:01:54,892
to impose on our dignified state
the destiny of Libya or Iraq.”

43
00:01:57,430 --> 00:02:00,230
A few years after Libya’s nukes
were shipped to Tennessee,

44
00:02:00,230 --> 00:02:03,430
U.S.-backed airstrikes helped
overthrow Qaddafi:

45
00:02:03,430 --> 00:02:05,530
a vivid reminder to
Kim Jong-un of what

46
00:02:05,530 --> 00:02:08,680
happens to leaders who
give up their defenses.

47
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:10,660
So why is Bolton
invoking a reference

48
00:02:10,660 --> 00:02:13,390
that’s clearly
so inflammatory?

49
00:02:13,390 --> 00:02:15,880
There are some who speculate
that Bolton is intentionally

50
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:18,370
sabotaging the
North Korea talks,

51
00:02:18,370 --> 00:02:21,130
just as he did in 2003,
because he believes

52
00:02:21,130 --> 00:02:23,140
North Korea can’t be trusted.

53
00:02:23,140 --> 00:02:25,270
This is him on Fox News
just a few weeks before

54
00:02:25,270 --> 00:02:28,060
becoming national
security adviser.

55
00:02:28,060 --> 00:02:29,950
“Why in the world
would they agree

56
00:02:29,950 --> 00:02:32,120
to not halt the program,
to give it up completely?

57
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:34,450
It just doesn’t logically
make any sense.”

58
00:02:34,450 --> 00:02:36,520
“Because they’re lying.

59
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:38,800
You know, there’s an
all-purpose joke here.

60
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:40,310
Question: How do
you know

61
00:02:40,310 --> 00:02:43,120
that the North Korean
regime is lying?

62
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:45,070
Answer: Their lips
are moving.”

63
00:02:45,070 --> 00:02:47,590
According to Bolton,
this is their real goal.

64
00:02:47,590 --> 00:02:49,600
“They want to buy time.

65
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:52,000
Three months, six months,
12 months, whatever it is

66
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,180
they need to get
across the finish line.”

67
00:02:55,180 --> 00:02:57,720
Bolton says this was part
of his life as a pundit.

68
00:02:57,720 --> 00:03:00,610
Now his job is to help the
president achieve his goals.

69
00:03:00,610 --> 00:03:02,500
Which by all measures
seems to include

70
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:04,840
cutting a historic deal
with North Korea.

71
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:06,610
It could be that Bolton
simply believes

72
00:03:06,610 --> 00:03:08,560
the only way to prevent
North Korea from

73
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:11,890
playing games is to demand
a Libya-style playbook.

74
00:03:11,890 --> 00:03:14,440
But what is clear is
Bolton’s repeated talk

75
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:17,680
about the Libya model is
antagonizing the North —

76
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:19,660
and now apparently
the White House.

77
00:03:19,660 --> 00:03:21,970
“The Libyan model
that was mentioned

78
00:03:21,970 --> 00:03:23,680
was a much different deal.

79
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:26,350
This would be with
Kim Jong-un something

80
00:03:26,350 --> 00:03:28,770
where he’d be there,
he’d be in his country,

81
00:03:28,770 --> 00:00:00,000
he’d be running
his country.”
