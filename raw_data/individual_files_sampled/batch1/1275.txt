hello and welcome to rewind I'm Rochelle Carey since we launched al Jazeera English back in 2006 our library of award-winning documentaries has been growing year by year so here on rewind we decided to revisit some of the most important of those stories once again today we're rewinding to 2010 and North Korea for the past several months North Korea's deteriorate in relations with the US and the administration of Donald Trump in particular have threatened to plunge the world into the darkness of a nuclear war North Korea's increasing military buildup and testing of missiles now presents an apparent threat to Japan and Beyond across the Pacific as far as the United States president Trump's belligerent response had even included the threat of overwhelming military action Pyongyang's rhetoric is equally bellicose and though the regime claims that it needs a nuclear strike capability to deter the threat of u.s. aggression there is history here as well there are North Koreans still living who have personal experience of American bombing during the Korean War nearly 70 years ago back in 2010 people in power travel to North Korea to investigate claims that some of those bombs contained not high explosive but biological weapons insects deliberately infected with deadly diseases it's a claim that the US has always denied but filmmaker Tim Tate had unique access to this extraordinary story traveling deep inside the country to talk to men who claimed to be survivors an attack that America insists never happened here's dirty little secrets almost 60 years ago this peaceful Lake was the scene of either a terrible crime or a cynical hoax each of these old men is either a witness to that crime or a participant in that hoax what happened or never happened here in 1952 is the key to one of the most intractable international disputes today the Korean War was the first armed confrontation of the Cold War in 1946 the United States unilaterally divided Korea along the 38th parallel when in 1950 North Korean forces backed by the army of communist China crossed the border to unify the country America persuaded the United Nations to support military action against what Washington saw as the global threat of international communist the fact that communist forces have invaded Korea is a warning that there may be similar acts of aggression in other parts of the world over the next three bloody years an estimated two million soldiers died or were maimed at least two million civilians were killed or wounded and millions more were made homeless but early in 1952 North Korea claimed that villages throughout the country were suffering unprecedented outbreaks of bubonic plague anthrax and typhus it accused the United States of bacteriological warfare dropping germ bombs containing insects shellfish and feathers infected with plague as well as anthrax and cholera America angrily denied the claim just released films lay bare the shocking truths behind communist charges of germ warfare in Korea and ever since the germ warfare allegations have been dismissed as communist propaganda from an isolationist rogue state broadcast by the communist propaganda machine throughout the world today North Korea is the most impenetrable state on the planet yet over the past twenty years professor Mori masataka a leading Japanese academic has gradually won the confidence of Pyongyang's secretive rulers Coquelin icon a highly join : optimal anus chosen to go signatory Saigon or descent a second about that oldest sistema una Fatima's now Marie has persuaded Pyongyang to allow our cameras to follow him through his latest visit it is an unprecedented step foreign journalists are routinely banned from entering North Korea we will be working under strict control told where and what we can film and accompanied by government officials at all times yet we will also be taken deep into the heart of this most hidden country to meet men who claimed to have witnessed America's use of germ warfare firsthand in the center of Pyongyang the Korean army maintains a vast museum dedicated to documenting its version of the war with America inside professor Mori examines a room given over to what North Korea claims to be direct evidence of germ warfare by the United States including specimen jars filled with flies mosquitoes and fleas all allegedly infected with deadly pathogens typhoid called there are pests like this one heavy diseases they injects like the small poisons into the insects and they put inside like this bombs and drops into the everyday six North Korean according to North Korea American pilots dropped specially adapted bombs these carried no explosives but split open to release the infected insects which would then pass on the diseases to the local population jo bombs inside like this big bombs they put some insects yeah I mean 34 kinds of insects in a separate projection room Mori is given a private screening of what North Korea claims is news film shot in 1952 the footage appears to show masses of insects crawling on snow-covered ground beside the bomb casings a highly unusual phenomenon and also logically is tidy only hired consider let us know if you know any so no sons ISIL to power our DNA okay stop the arena sorry I have particular can eat genie taken among them your graciousness but humans from which country were these insects dropped by American pilots or placed here by North Korean propagandists is this evidence of a war crime or as an America claims merely crude propaganda Cosima - Michaela Sirico akashi-kun amandaandsarah color-coded terror see so yummy OST knows Kohi issue huge teams tada Serena's sekai no cocks - mechanical Munda insanity CODIS the national qur'an or communism commences no no no City no champion Delta u so U mass ending no hoga you require hokey start a Korean okay well Catherine Tate to you Nora this your knowledge dawn over Pyongyang at 7:00 a.m. government sirens wake the city summoning its people to begin a new day's work Mauri masataka is leaving Pyongyang and heading out into North Korea's rural hinterland in search of people who claim to have witnessed and survived germ warfare but the very nature of this country means that he is completely reliant on the Pyongyang government to provide his transport and to put forward his interviewees on the outskirts of kwangin a village 45 kilometres east of Pyongyang to elderly farmers are waiting to meet him Yong Chan been an own toxic lost their fathers during the war both claimed that an American plane dropped a germ bomb close to the village changing it was written in your cycle you prepare any you know chemical in India to preserving even much borracho its cover kill a pitcher need to go bull which new vehicle has meter such algorithm Borja Linga Kimbrough Tony Indian American even Tennyson now my jaw making took place on the 27th of March 1952 I mean I was AV teacher matin during the war captured American pilots made filmed confessions in which they admitted dropping bombs filled with infected insects on North Korean villages my soul will never be clean after such an incident I mean after million I didn't say Lauren drone Jae Myung Tony Jordan road madison coil given Motoko kid I mean he clean the kittens a poor woman then we hand over Quinn goes to beta more than they could the children's hamsa you mean I'm a chicken thermos I mean I'm assuming did I mean I have a shindig are mostly Timbuktu demonically you do not enter yes he gay boomers harem in reggae and manage on the reso he has to me he woman come in ceramic autumns Cienega hey Holly I never wanted to participate in bacteriological warfare I guess you might stay out go ahead and do it our poll in there filmed confessions the American Air Force officers expressed apparently genuine remorse for their actions but when they returned home at the end of the war they all retracted their confessions so where does the truth lie for professor Morey at least the North Korean witnesses are the more convincing The Courier thousands on ohina koko de areco know them inaccurate mr.

Nugent came you got money to the needs another golden deer Secretariat I can origin in March 1952 this peaceful rural area was heavily bombed by the US Air Force by then the war ground to a stalemate American military chiefs had already dropped thousands of tons of napalm and were considering a nuclear strike but the people of Matan village claimed to have been the victims of a very different weapon because I mean he would he cause those hardships you didn't there I mean who would they make routine and there even for me I am NOT you do Jaco do nice I didn't dare called Qi Lang Co you can do Negreanu auction ELISA the reason he sent you according to the villagers within days many of them fell sick and began to die their symptoms apparently consistent with bubonic plague a disease with no recent history in Korea the Google moon will be talked about especially ocassion know the DPRK Dasani psyche insane he ran a test on a musical note I Canada's national so if you remain a Lara told you - Nara but Mourinho's that testimony from North Korean citizens will not be enough to convince a skeptical world that the United States used germ warfare in Korea says your highest are sorry John Cena cantina Chaucer no Tina Yuri Gagarin teeny a okra relative of Torah soon a photo in fact within months of the allegations being made the North Koreans did invite an international commission to visit the country composed of scientists from France Italy Sweden the Soviet Union and Brazil and led by a distinguished if left-leaning British embryologist it toward the affected areas interviewed the sick and the dying and carried out a detailed analysis of their infections the Commission's six hundred page report included results of post-mortems on the victims these identified plague typhoid cholera and anthrax it concluded the germ warfare had been deployed exactly as the North Koreans claimed but despite its wealth of scientific evidence it was dismissed by America as communist disinformation Monica doesn't know anything America changed to Standish ago I had a career choice on Shikoku no problem Dyson destiny the colony a second ago a girl turned on monotectic Kunichika removal report in silver that are usually in Geneva today at the 38th parallel Korea remains divided North and South Korea remained technically at war every hour of every day their border guards square up to each other across the symbolic dividing line under the constant gaze of American forces but Mori masataka search for information about biological warfare in Korea will take him far away from this disputed border Harbin northeastern China in the 1930s and 1940s Japan occupied this part of China inside these brick buildings a division of the Imperial Japanese Army unit 731 carried out grotesque human experiments as a result Japan became the first country ever to perfect the technology of biological warfare my interest in this I Antonio de Rossi naturalizer oh sure soon Ian Cheech and Chong dong I don't really know man Ruben Tejada the society Saturday social dominance Jean Jean de Ferran daughter fishing commentator lee yong warranty entry times allah who through the ecology mean hiroshi devices - the japanese experiments exposed their living victims to insects or shellfish infected with plague anthrax and cholera while weapons experts created unique bombs to deliver these pathogens to their target during World War two Japan dropped thousands of these bombs throughout northern China infecting towns and villages with plague cholera anthrax and typhoid she doomed under you can guys were - I'll show you on my own here there's a woman the bottle that they don't go deep unit 731 was run by Japanese scientists and led by general Shiro Ishii yet despite clear evidence that unit 731 used biological warfare on such an industrial scale after the war neither Shiro Ishii nor the leaders of his germ weapons team was ever prosecuted for war crimes engagement is nobody say yo Sonia buyer sure how do you do me all that she's a nobody dissing on her - we are the cocaine Dohee dollar you bet he's all for it say Sunni and the yen don't hurt some water faucet dear soul - at that the techniques and the germs used by unit 731 match exactly the details of North Korea's claims of American biological warfare and today Chinese officials at least are convinced that there was a link between the two megawatts a union truce onion the house in generalities yeah sure English idioms cheese raw yet or dollar UN she's a nobody the shooting shrunk down render to hashiru for professor Mori the narrative he has heard amid the ruins of unit 731 is deeply shocking muscle condone I cut all of the snare is also another Hinayana at all she should organization percolated -

BW program so we decided that we're gonna trade in sort of a Faustian deal we trade issues non-prosecution for his secrets which he smuggled out and and so the deal is made the trunks of of raw data arrived and in a sense we've sold our souls because we needed to know that they were able to develop weapons that were capable of killing hundreds of thousands of people these once top-secret documents revealed that to speed its program the United States paid ishi and his top germ warfare scientists handsomely for their cooperation they were assisted by direct payments payments in kind food miscellaneous gift items entertainment from 1947 behind this security fence at Fort Dietrich in Maryland the US Army began work to expand issues use of insects to deliver bubonic plague anthrax cholera and typhus not very far from Edgewood in historic Frederick Maryland are the biological warfare laboratories we're working on delivery systems from planes and from missiles and from other apparatus of both fleas but primarily mosquitos it was a very active program a well funded program a program in which we in fact were testing some of these delivery systems cloud of biological warfare agent can be generated so successful was Fort Dietrich in perfecting the technology of biological warfare that in late 1951 as American forces were bogged down in Korea the US Joint Chiefs of Staff issued a top-secret order to begin testing germ weapons on the battlefield large-scale field tests should be conducted to determine the effectiveness of specific BW agents under operational conditions at the time America was fighting only one war Korea if the order by the Joint Chiefs of Staff was obeyed there was only one battlefield where biological weapons could be tested and video testimony given as he was dying by a Japanese technician who worked at unit 731 suggests that these trials may have been actively assisted by the original masterminds of biological warfare today you're not my type in Cantonese Kalitta machine Quran Guzman was in my messenger santo what is't or son-in-law chosen says oh nice to be so late oh no sorry according to North Korea America began dropping bombs filled with infected insects in January 1952 near the end of the Korean winter in support it sites what it claims is contemporary newsreel footage showing scientists examining insects surrounding the remains of bombs on snow-covered ground it's like a bomb casing from a standard leaflet bomb that was used to deliver pamphlets and and and that sort of information we showed this film to entomologist and biological warfare expert Professor Jeffrey Lockwood it's really difficult to say what that is there's there's no scale so I can't tell what the size of those insects are given that that appears to be snow I would guess that it could be something like stone flies crawling around on the snow but for professor Lockwood the problem is not with the insects the bombs or the snow it's with the veracity of the film itself it has to be almost certain that what we're seeing here is a recreation of what the Koreans saw were claimed to have seen the possibility of getting a camera and a film crew to an area where insects that this sort of density have been dispersed in time to actually film that converges on zero so what we're seeing is what they said they saw and this is probably as close as they can come to that does that necessarily mean but it didn't happen no it doesn't it doesn't mean that it didn't happen it's simply that this is not evidence that it did happen so this is is is I would gather this is their attempt to simulate the sorts of things that that they that they saw in 1952 United States representatives took to the floor of the United Nations it is no exaggeration to say that that problem is the gravest one now confronting the world they denounced the North Korean evidence as a clumsy fake and a lie but in doing so they told their own lies undermining the credibility of all American denials of biological warfare some of the denial was just absurd almost laughable when when for instance one particular US official says we did not have any development of insect vector disease research in the United States at that time it's simply an absurd and bold-faced deception it's a lie working up defenses against chemical biological and Radiological warfare is the responsibility of the Army chemical Corps word insects dropped over North Korean parts of China my sense is that there were incidents that involved probably quite limited but very very important US testing of biological materials and how will the issue ever be laid to rest once and for all I don't know if the issue will be later I mean how would it be is with The Smoking Gun with with a definitive testimony from a US official who was involved in the program and can say yes we did it the key to the mystery may lie with the American Air Force officers who originally confessed to dropping germ bombs very few are still alive today but we tracked down one of the survivors to this peaceful senior citizens community near Houston in Texas kenneth enoch is 85 years old today he enjoys a comfortable retirement sharing wartime memories with his wife Barb these are supposed to be bombs over here is that right those are bombs Leeanne I think it says if this man is hungry give him food but from 1950 onward left tenant Kenneth Enoch was a navigator on US Air Force b-26 bombing missions over North Korea all with one or two moisture missions we flew at night my favorite target was trains we really like trains you know sometimes the wing would almost hit the engine yeah and actually if we drop net napalm on the engine you know to try and discourage them I guess the way they you could feel those napalm go off on January the 13th 1952 after 53 night bombing missions Enochs plane was shot down and he bailed out over North Korean territory I landed and the parachutes filled and I found a corner of a rice paddy and it was snow and there were quite a bit of snow on the ground and I saw a dark spot over there in the corner and so I felt well that's a good place for me to be but in less than an hour Kenneth Enoch was captured by North Korean and Chinese soldiers it was the morning of his 27th birthday they marched me down to the house and I had a place to sit and they had a guard there and they handed me a piece of paper in English said don't worry about it and all that which they're gonna send handy anyway you know they don't want any trouble for a while at least but anyway thought well is that leftenant Enoch would be held captive in North Korea for the next 20 months but what happened to him and what he did during his time as a prisoner of lure would prove to be one of the most bitterly disputed pieces of evidence in the allegations of American biological warfare on April the 1st 1952 Kenneth Enoch made a detailed confession that he had taken part in a series of biological warfare missions on film and over eight closely written pages leftenant Enoch described his biological weapons instructions the techniques of dropping germ bombs and the code word assigned to log them on his return in all 36 American Air Force officers made written or filmed confessions of dropping germ bombs while in captivity but when they were sent back home at the end of the war the US Department of Defense warmed them that they could be brought before courts-martial to face treason charges subsequently in response to identical questions each officer made a carefully worded retraction just released films lay bare the shocking truth behind communist charges of germ warfare in Korea and the so called confessions of captured us Airmen each retraction was filmed by military cameras and handed to television news reel companies you can't eat it it has been alleged by Chinese communist sources that you have confessed to participation in so-called germ warfare bombing raids over North Korea would you care to make a statement regarding these charges yes sir leftenant Kenneth E Knox retraction was typical these movies wire recordings interviews were forced upon me the Chinese said that due to my false to morph to to my confession which which is absolutely false during my confession I was now be branded by the people of the world as a in fact a war criminal did you describe the methods used by the communist interrogators to secure statement yes sir they used both physical and mental pressure they pushed me around stood me in attention for long periods forced me to sit at attention finally I could see that there was no alternative insanity or death they they threatened me and threatened me again that I should never leave alive if I didn't cooperate but nearly 60 years later Kenneth Enoch now denies he was ill treated by his captors no no no no but you know one time they had me you know I didn't stay in the same place all the time and I can't recall what particular thing but and maybe maybe they wanted to move somebody else you know how whatever they do so I got transferred to another building another house another home and it was cold and the so my room wasn't quite as big but it was it was all I needed you know were they but they came with because we're so cold they came with a pot full of charcoal you know Liat and they put it in their own to keep me warm the second reason flight left Tennant Enoch gave from making his confession was mental pressure also forced to read their propaganda to make favorable comments on it that is their their Russian publications and so on on communism today once again his story changes hey I know you know I mean they I don't think so and I'm thinking retired doctor a movie they had all kind of books served if you wanted him I guess and if you bought one you didn't like you know it's just over here so why then did he make such a detailed confession today he claims that it was a deliberate deception first names birthdates false anything else I could think of he says that he booby-trapped a document giving his fellow crew members the names of American cartoon characters there was a fella named Dick Tracy they're crazy you know Dick Tracy over there yeah Richard Tracy what the hell you know and I was going to put a junior in there too you know we're doing here Tracy that tell me this I'm making up all these names yes but they were there I wanted them to be recognizable so if I got Tracy and jr. that would have been great except that you know you can't put too many people on one of the little airplanes what sigh it would have been a real dandy yeah what probably would add the president didn't name somewhere the difficulty with this story is that many of the dates and places detailed in Kenneth Enochs confession have since been confirmed as accurate the only mention of anything approaching a cartoon character is a passing reference to his gunnery officer sergeant Tracy and then nearly 60 years on Kenneth Enoch seems to make at least a partial admission that the United States did deploy bacteriological weapons first of all I think that you have to understand what what these biological warfare or whatever we won't call it is it's a pretty big field and it's yes was he called specialists and evil doctors and all of that nonsense but but this the people who would deal in that don't have to go fight and so that's a pretty sweet deal for them you know but they said you extend it with you nevertheless he still denies that he personally played any part in the affair I thought what she was you know I don't everything to do with this thing here this flight you know I'm just a passenger official records of bombing raids over North Korea are held in the US National Archive one way to clear up the confusion about Kenneth Enochs confession and subsequent retraction would be to examine the flight logs for his missions over Korea but they were removed from the files but the US Air Force on March the 23rd 1952 two months after he was captured and one week before he made his written confession and after the war the US military imposed a top secret classification on all documents relating to biological warfare in the Far East many of the flight records for Korea have never been released you saw you Shogun was a loop Buddha in touchy no show you know attacks you are eating Metallica Messiah College is a mechanical you register you know he guys photogenic I know not there each direction businesses touched a political team that mascara more Poonam America Lana she do now make a kanesha relative are called is no Gianna Washington remembers the Korean War very differently to Pyongyang the United States still honors its military men and women as heroes who fought on behalf of the free world to hold back the march of international communism and yet when we asked both the Department of Defense in the State Department for filmed interviews to discuss the allegations of America's biological warfare program both refused they also declined to respond to ten specific questions about North Korea's claims instead a government spokesperson issued a two line statement describing the allegations as baseless and the disinformation campaign that refuses to die one thing is clear until those allegations are laid to rest and America's innocence or culpability is established beyond doubt perhaps by an independent inquiry one of the most enduring cold war mysteries will continue to haunt its relationship with the world's most secretive state dirty little secrets from 2010 a persuasive story but one that has been consistently denied by every American administration for more than 60 years North Korea though this story contributes to a profound suspicion of the United States and its intentions in Southeast Asia I'm joined now from UK by Professor hazel Smith a Korea expert from London School of Oriental and African Studies professor thank you so much for joining us so if all of this happened with you know deadly insects biological weapons if all this happened it was more than 60 years ago but having said that is this still a very real live issue for for North Koreans now the truth is about the Korean War is that it was a very dirty war on all sides there are atrocities by the North Koreans by the South Koreans there are many many people killed and many many orphans and many maimed so the whole of the war still remains controversial particularly for North Koreans and for South Koreans because they've still got family members that are split since 1953 once when the war ended there's been no communication between the two sides so the issues about alleged germ warfare a part and parcel of the discourse which takes place in North Korea this was a controversial topic at the time in the 1950s it remains controversial now there's still no smoking gun evidence that this took took place but it forms part of the official discourse it doesn't however form part of the day-to-day discussions of North Koreans I lived and worked in North Korea for two years all over the country lots of different settings in farms and hospitals and clinics and taught to lots and lots of different people it was never raised once as an issue with me not even in passing whereas some other issues were raised of course things like the fact that there were so many men killed in the 1950s in the war that there were disproportionate amounts of mean left alive today for a brief moment there was a slight bit of de-escalation but obviously the tension is still there how do you see things playing out on the Korean Peninsula well there are different objectives the North Koreans want to preserve regime security which for them means both territorial defence prevention of military intervention from the outside but also security for the current government and for those in power it saw what happened in Iraq to Saddam Hussein and in Libya to Gaddafi and their argument is that if those countries had maintained nuclear weapons program or similar sorts of programs that they wouldn't have been vulnerable to invasion from the United States and others although what's encouraging is with South Korea and North Col at the heart of the matter on the Korean Peninsula at least talking to each other now in 2018 in a way that they haven't been for two or three years there are some diplomatic channels which will at least at this stage allow for talks on more sensitive issues but there is a long long way to go before we can see an end to these conflicts Thank You professor hazel Smith for joining us and that is it from us to check out the rewind page at aljazeera.com for more films from this series I'm Rochelle Carey thank you for joining us see you again soon you
