1
00:00:08,100 --> 00:00:10,600
My name is Johnny Harris and I make
videos here at Vox.

2
00:00:12,660 --> 00:00:13,340
I spent my entire

3
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:18,340
last year traveling around to different
places making documentaries on the topic

4
00:00:18,340 --> 00:00:19,360
of Borders.

5
00:00:29,100 --> 00:00:33,180
I'm excited to announce that Borders is
back. I'm hitting the road again to go tell

6
00:00:33,180 --> 00:00:36,160
the story of some of the most
interesting places in the world.

7
00:00:40,860 --> 00:00:41,920
We're stuck again.

8
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:57,380
The first location for this
next round of Borders is going to be:

9
00:00:58,820 --> 00:00:59,540
Hong Kong.

10
00:01:09,620 --> 00:01:12,160
I'm doing things a little bit
differently this time. Instead of going

11
00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:16,660
to these places to focus on one major
topic and to make like a 15 minute

12
00:01:16,660 --> 00:01:18,600
documentary about that topic,

13
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:20,440
I'm actually gonna be making a lot more

14
00:01:20,440 --> 00:01:21,740
videos from these places.

15
00:01:21,740 --> 00:01:24,070
I'm gonna stay there a little bit longer and make more

16
00:01:24,070 --> 00:01:27,020
videos that are more narrow and a little
bit shorter.

17
00:01:27,020 --> 00:01:28,479
Wait, so no more sweet

18
00:01:28,479 --> 00:01:30,740
documentaries with all the fancy
graphics?

19
00:01:30,740 --> 00:01:31,941
No, no no no no. That's not what I'm saying.

20
00:01:31,941 --> 00:01:35,530
These are still gonna be beautiful, really well
produced pieces, they're just gonna be a

21
00:01:35,530 --> 00:01:39,009
little bit more narrow in their scope
and they're gonna be shorter, but there's

22
00:01:39,009 --> 00:01:40,160
gonna be a bunch more of them.

23
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:40,660
Okay, cool.

24
00:01:51,740 --> 00:01:56,000
As always I'm looking for your help in
finding and reporting these stories.

25
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,070
If you live in Hong Kong or Macau or have
traveled there or read something

26
00:02:00,070 --> 00:02:02,320
interesting about it, I want to hear
about it.

27
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:03,190
It doesn't necessarily have to

28
00:02:03,190 --> 00:02:07,390
be about conflict or the political
situation, it can be about an interesting

29
00:02:07,390 --> 00:02:10,544
community or an interesting restaurant
or figure or person.

30
00:02:10,544 --> 00:02:11,560
I just want to know

31
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:15,200
what's worth explaining about this
peculiar part of the world.

32
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:17,440
If you do have some ideas, I want to hear about it.

33
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:19,030
You can go to Facebook or Instagram and

34
00:02:19,030 --> 00:02:19,900
DM me.

35
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:28,680
Now if you do live in Hong Kong
Macau and you want to meet up with me

36
00:02:28,690 --> 00:02:32,080
when I travel there next month or you
want to contribute to Borders in some

37
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:32,840
other way,

38
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:35,800
go to:
vox.com/borders-local

39
00:02:35,860 --> 00:02:36,459
where you can fill out a form

40
00:02:36,459 --> 00:02:39,640
telling me a little bit more about
yourself and how you'd be willing to

41
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:40,720
contribute to Borders.

42
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:43,180
This could be
anything from me asking you to film

43
00:02:43,180 --> 00:02:46,540
something on your cell phone that you
see every day or filming a part of your

44
00:02:46,540 --> 00:02:48,720
life that would be really interesting
for these stories.

45
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:04,300
So the last thing I'll say is that we
just created this Facebook Watch page,

46
00:03:04,300 --> 00:03:07,620
which is a Facebook page basically
optimized for viewing videos.

47
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:12,000
That's where I'm going to be posting all the
Border's content first, so if you want to

48
00:03:12,010 --> 00:03:16,360
kind of subscribe or follow Borders
content only, that's the place to go.

49
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:20,740
It's gonna be a lot cleaner than following my
personal pages which are usually like,

50
00:03:20,740 --> 00:03:22,300
photos of my family.

51
00:03:22,300 --> 00:03:26,170
If you want just the
Border's content go follow this page and

52
00:03:26,170 --> 00:03:29,590
you'll get a notification every time
there's some new update or new video

53
00:03:29,590 --> 00:03:30,708
that's published.

54
00:03:30,708 --> 00:03:32,580
Okay, housekeeping items
out of the way.

55
00:03:33,340 --> 00:03:35,500
Borders Hongkong is officially in motion.

56
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:38,620
I'm excited to hear what stories you come up with.

57
00:03:49,180 --> 00:00:00,000
And yes I plan to wear this orange coat
until the day it comes unstitched.
