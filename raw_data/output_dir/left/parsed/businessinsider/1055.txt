sir then act like one
President Trump out here you watch the
morning show here's what I do every
morning

having trouble drawing a crowd and your
approval rating keeps thinking
butt-kicking thousands of my fellow
veterans off their health insurance by
killing the Affordable Care Act and
banning Muslims won't help that's not
the America I sacrificed for you want to
be a legitimate president sir then act
like one
