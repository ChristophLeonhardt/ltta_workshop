1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:03,689
let's go to the White House I want to
start off by reiterating the messages

2
00:00:03,689 --> 00:00:07,830
that FEMA administrator Brock long and
the president's Homeland Security and

3
00:00:07,830 --> 00:00:11,790
counterterrorism
officer Tom Bossert made this morning

4
00:00:11,790 --> 00:00:16,609
regarding the ongoing relief efforts in
the wakes of hurricanes Irma and Harvey

5
00:00:16,609 --> 00:00:21,390
life-sustaining operations are still
underway and we encourage everyone in

6
00:00:21,390 --> 00:00:25,949
the designated areas in Florida Puerto
Rico and the US Virgin Islands to

7
00:00:25,949 --> 00:00:33,090
register online at WWDC sir assistance
gov that's the quickest way to register

8
00:00:33,090 --> 00:00:37,350
for federal assistance as I said
yesterday the president was pleased that

9
00:00:37,350 --> 00:00:41,610
members on all sides of the aisle came
together last week under his leadership

10
00:00:41,610 --> 00:00:45,870
to deliver critical relief to those
affected by the storms and he has

11
00:00:45,870 --> 00:00:50,430
continued that spirit of bar
bipartisanship and unity this week last

12
00:00:50,430 --> 00:00:55,079
night he hosted Republican and Democrat
senators too to discuss advancing the

13
00:00:55,079 --> 00:00:58,859
administration's legislative priorities
particularly the importance of

14
00:00:58,859 --> 00:01:03,210
delivering tax cuts and reform for the
middle class today in addition to

15
00:01:03,210 --> 00:01:07,290
important meetings with Republican and
Democrat House members and Senator Tim

16
00:01:07,290 --> 00:01:11,369
Scott the president will also host
Senator Schumer and congresswoman Pelosi

17
00:01:11,369 --> 00:01:16,439
this evening for a bipartisan discussion
on the upcoming legislative agenda with

18
00:01:16,439 --> 00:01:20,670
a focus on tax reform historic tax
reform is one of the most significant

19
00:01:20,670 --> 00:01:25,080
ways that we will jumpstart our economy
creating jobs and raising wages for all

20
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:29,579
Americans the president and his team
will continue to engage with all members

21
00:01:29,579 --> 00:01:33,390
of Congress who are willing to work with
us to deliver this critical relief for

22
00:01:33,390 --> 00:01:37,500
the American people finally on a
slightly lighter note I'd like to

23
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:41,729
announce that Frank from Falls Church
Virginia whose letter I read last month

24
00:01:41,729 --> 00:01:46,470
offering his services to mow the White
House lawn will be here on Friday he'll

25
00:01:46,470 --> 00:01:49,950
work with the groundskeeping crew here
at the White House and will help cut the

26
00:01:49,950 --> 00:01:54,720
grass in the Rose Garden the president
is committed to keeping the American

27
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:58,860
dream alive for kids like Frank and
we're all looking forward to having him

28
00:01:58,860 --> 00:02:01,439
here and with that I'll take your
questions

29
00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:04,979
John a couple of questions about this
here first of all can you give us a

30
00:02:04,979 --> 00:02:07,670
readout of the meeting that the
President had with

31
00:02:07,670 --> 00:02:12,739
Scot this morning sure this was a very
productive meeting that the president

32
00:02:12,739 --> 00:02:19,099
and the senator both wanted to have
something to discuss potential solutions

33
00:02:19,099 --> 00:02:23,930
moving forward to bring the country
together a focus on unity also talking

34
00:02:23,930 --> 00:02:27,980
and touching on some of the priorities
for the legislative agenda moving into

35
00:02:27,980 --> 00:02:32,480
the fall senator scott express his
displeasure at all with the president's

36
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:36,739
initial reaction to Charlottesville not
at all they talked about it pretty

37
00:02:36,739 --> 00:02:42,500
in-depth but the focus was primarily on
solutions moving forward and that was

38
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:47,030
what both people came to the meeting
wanting to discuss is what we can do to

39
00:02:47,030 --> 00:02:50,420
bring people together not talk about
divisions within the country second

40
00:02:50,420 --> 00:02:52,880
question following the meeting that he
had with the president last night West

41
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:56,930
Virginia Senator Joe Manchin said in his
perfect world you get 30 Democratic

42
00:02:56,930 --> 00:03:01,100
senators and 30 Republican senators
agreeing on a plan for tax reform does

43
00:03:01,100 --> 00:03:05,480
the president believe he could get 30
Democratic senators and still stick to

44
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:10,459
his principles for tax reform I think
America hopes he can I think for the for

45
00:03:10,459 --> 00:03:15,440
the sake of most Americans the goal is I
would actually set the sights much

46
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:19,690
higher and that you have every member of
the Senate come together to help pass

47
00:03:19,690 --> 00:03:28,459
massive tax cuts and bring tax reform to
this country tonight with Schumer and

48
00:03:28,459 --> 00:03:31,910
Pelosi they seem to be getting closer
but in the past the president is called

49
00:03:31,910 --> 00:03:37,040
Chuck Schumer a clown Pelosi a loser but
now he seems to recognize that he needs

50
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:41,209
them how does that work which means I
think it's less about him needing them

51
00:03:41,209 --> 00:03:44,930
but as more about the president wanting
to work with them and wanting to help

52
00:03:44,930 --> 00:03:48,530
move this country forward as we've said
many times before we've got a very

53
00:03:48,530 --> 00:03:52,880
ambitious legislative agenda for this
fall and the president wants to work

54
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:56,359
with anybody that wants to move America
forward and if they're willing to do

55
00:03:56,359 --> 00:04:00,380
that sit down be part of that
conversation on both tax cuts and tax

56
00:04:00,380 --> 00:04:04,280
reform responsible immigration reforms
and the president certainly welcomes

57
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:08,480
those conversations you sure
Pelosi is equal allies on the hill for

58
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:12,950
getting things done on par with
McConnell and Ryan well the president is

59
00:04:12,950 --> 00:04:18,320
a Republican and certainly I think
ideologically that's a much cleaner

60
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:22,640
matchup but if again if these people in
these individuals whether they're

61
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:27,590
Democrats or Republicans want to come
together to push the President's agenda

62
00:04:27,590 --> 00:04:31,790
and the agenda that clearly the American
people want to see or they wouldn't have

63
00:04:31,790 --> 00:04:35,780
elected Donald Trump then we're
certainly happy to have that

64
00:04:35,780 --> 00:04:41,360
conversation and move that ball forward
no I I know the president came out for

65
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:45,820
Graham Cassady today but a lot of people
believe that may not come to pass

66
00:04:45,820 --> 00:04:49,850
senator Alexander has introduced a more
incremental bill that would stabilize

67
00:04:49,850 --> 00:04:55,100
the insurance markets could the
president support a bill like that or

68
00:04:55,100 --> 00:04:58,700
does it have to be more of a full-scale
repeal and secondly what does the

69
00:04:58,700 --> 00:05:05,360
president make of Democrats efforts on
single parent I think that the president

70
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:09,890
as well as the majority of the country
knows that the single-payer system that

71
00:05:09,890 --> 00:05:14,300
the Democrats are proposing is a
horrible idea I can't think of anything

72
00:05:14,300 --> 00:05:17,840
worse than having government be more
involved in your health care instead of

73
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:21,590
less involved the president's focused on
looking at ways where government gets

74
00:05:21,590 --> 00:05:26,150
out of the way people have more control
over their own health care and looking

75
00:05:26,150 --> 00:05:30,470
at ways to again fully repeal and
replace would certainly be a priority

76
00:05:30,470 --> 00:05:33,170
but we want to move the system forward
and make sure that we're in a place

77
00:05:33,170 --> 00:05:36,440
that's actually sustainable and that we
have a health care system that works

78
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:41,660
that people who are under that health
care system actually have a say in you

79
00:05:41,660 --> 00:05:45,770
signed something that's not a full-scale
repeal obviously I'm not just saying

80
00:05:45,770 --> 00:05:49,550
single-payer but something a lot of you
see the specific pieces of that

81
00:05:49,550 --> 00:05:53,960
legislation before we were gonna weigh
in on a hypothetical bill Matthew thanks

82
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:58,129
two questions first is most present
tense going to be attending that

83
00:05:58,129 --> 00:06:04,039
tonight I believe the vice-president's
actually hosting another dinner at his

84
00:06:04,039 --> 00:06:08,029
residence with other members of Congress
and will make sure we get those more

85
00:06:08,029 --> 00:06:10,909
details to you on that later today and
on a different topic I wanted to follow

86
00:06:10,909 --> 00:06:16,580
up on some statements you made yesterday
that James Comey you said he some of his

87
00:06:16,580 --> 00:06:20,449
conduct likely could have been illegal I
was wondering what specifically you were

88
00:06:20,449 --> 00:06:23,239
referring to there because the one thing
you pointed out was those memos that

89
00:06:23,239 --> 00:06:26,869
were given to The Times but those were
didn't contain any classified

90
00:06:26,869 --> 00:06:29,509
information and were handed over once he
was a private citizen

91
00:06:29,509 --> 00:06:34,699
yeah the memos that Comey leaked were
created on an FBI computer while he was

92
00:06:34,699 --> 00:06:38,269
the director he claims there were
private property but they clearly follow

93
00:06:38,269 --> 00:06:43,399
the protocol of an official FBI document
leaking FBI memos on a sensitive case

94
00:06:43,399 --> 00:06:48,110
regardless of classification violates
federal laws including the Privacy Act

95
00:06:48,110 --> 00:06:52,129
standard FBI employment agreement and
non-disclosure agreement all personnel

96
00:06:52,129 --> 00:06:57,319
must sign I think that's pretty clean
and clear that that would be a violation

97
00:06:57,319 --> 00:07:03,199
to see happen that's not up to me to
decide I'm certainly not an attorney but

98
00:07:03,199 --> 00:07:10,939
I think that the facts of the case are
very clear so you you're not saying that

99
00:07:10,939 --> 00:07:17,199
the Justice Department should look into
this but you do believe that Comey did

100
00:07:17,769 --> 00:07:23,300
was illegal the Department of Justice
has to look into any allegations of

101
00:07:23,300 --> 00:07:27,319
illegal whether or not something is
illegal or not that's not up to me to

102
00:07:27,319 --> 00:07:32,499
decide what I've said and what I'm
talking about our facts James Comey

103
00:07:32,499 --> 00:07:36,769
leaking of information questionable
statements under oath politicizing an

104
00:07:36,769 --> 00:07:41,029
investigation those are real reasons for
why he was fired and the president's

105
00:07:41,029 --> 00:07:45,199
decision was 100 percent right which
we've said multiple times over and over

106
00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:48,679
and in fact I think the more and more we
learned the more and more that's been

107
00:07:48,679 --> 00:07:51,340
vindicated

108
00:07:51,340 --> 00:07:55,240
on another topic do you need details on
where the president will be going

109
00:07:55,240 --> 00:08:01,480
tomorrow in Florida I mean anything
details on that trip he will be in the

110
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:06,010
Naples and Fort Myers area and as soon
as those final details about specifics

111
00:08:06,010 --> 00:08:11,410
ops are locked in we'll certainly keep
you guys posted Sarah the first one

112
00:08:11,410 --> 00:08:15,670
after meeting with Senator Scott yes the
president's money changed at all about

113
00:08:15,670 --> 00:08:20,110
that initial statement should be family
were forceful and we'll see sign this

114
00:08:20,110 --> 00:08:23,890
bipartisan resolution condemning the
violence in Charlottesville as well as

115
00:08:23,890 --> 00:08:27,910
hate groups like the KKK and the the
president was clear in his initial

116
00:08:27,910 --> 00:08:33,070
statement that he condemned hatred
bigotry racism of all forms

117
00:08:33,070 --> 00:08:40,380
he continues to stick to that message
he's been very consistent in that fact

118
00:08:40,380 --> 00:08:46,750
he and the senator talked about that and
discussed that and agreed that that was

119
00:08:46,750 --> 00:08:50,650
the appropriate place to be in terms of
whether or not he'll sign the joint

120
00:08:50,650 --> 00:08:54,100
resolution absolutely and he looks
forward to doing so as soon as he

121
00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:59,470
receives it which he hasn't done as I
came out here earlier his meeting with

122
00:08:59,470 --> 00:09:02,830
Chuck Schumer Nancy Pelosi tonight this
is the kind of thing that conservatives

123
00:09:02,830 --> 00:09:06,640
who ran against him by the presidential
race warned about that he would be

124
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:10,140
cutting deals with Chuck and Nancy and
that would not hold the ideals

125
00:09:10,140 --> 00:09:13,470
Servat is so why is he meeting with just
the two of them this evening and is he

126
00:09:13,470 --> 00:09:17,870
hoping to strike an immigration deal
wish you our blessing I think it's a

127
00:09:17,870 --> 00:09:22,560
pretty disingenuous for people to say
he's only meeting with Democrats the

128
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:26,660
president is the leader of the
Republican Party and was elected by

129
00:09:26,660 --> 00:09:31,500
Republicans he beat out 16 other
candidates to take that mantle on and

130
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:36,570
certainly I think one of the strongest
voices and so the idea that the

131
00:09:36,570 --> 00:09:39,959
Republican Party ideas are not
represented in that room it's just

132
00:09:39,959 --> 00:09:50,250
ridiculous some kind of deal similar to
the three-month extension working with

133
00:09:50,250 --> 00:09:54,149
Democrats on the dreamers issue I
wouldn't be surprised if it came up

134
00:09:54,149 --> 00:09:57,209
tonight but I'm not going to get ahead
of the conversations that they're gonna

135
00:09:57,209 --> 00:10:00,990
take place later this evening and as
always we'll certainly keep you guys

136
00:10:00,990 --> 00:10:11,060
posted on what those look like did the
White House know about that IG audit

137
00:10:11,060 --> 00:10:16,290
when the president has had to nominate
we're not going to get into the

138
00:10:16,290 --> 00:10:20,519
back-and-forth our focus particularly at
FEMA right now is on the safety and

139
00:10:20,519 --> 00:10:24,209
security of those that have been
affected by the hurricane we're not

140
00:10:24,209 --> 00:10:30,410
gonna go down rabbit holes on personnel
and our focus is on that as of right now

141
00:10:30,860 --> 00:10:34,620
senator Manchin said that last night at
dinner the president was adamant that

142
00:10:34,620 --> 00:10:39,209
the tax reform would not be a tax cut
for the rich you know on what basis the

143
00:10:39,209 --> 00:10:43,829
president was able to make that promise
is he alleging to hold the top tax rate

144
00:10:43,829 --> 00:10:48,360
of 39.6% are we not going to see a
reduction in that rate how can he assure

145
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:52,320
Americans that the rich won't get a tax
cut the president's priority when it

146
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:56,760
comes to tax cuts and tax reform is on
the middle-class helping grow the middle

147
00:10:56,760 --> 00:11:01,050
class helping create jobs simplifying
the system he's laid out those

148
00:11:01,050 --> 00:11:03,899
principles and that's where his focus is
and that's what he's going to push for

149
00:11:03,899 --> 00:11:06,690
as we move into this process the
question

150
00:11:06,690 --> 00:11:10,110
about Bernie Sanders's health plan in
January the president gave an interview

151
00:11:10,110 --> 00:11:13,710
of The Washington Post said he wanted to
see a program that would allow for

152
00:11:13,710 --> 00:11:18,090
insurance for everybody and that would
leverage Medicare and Medicaid ability

153
00:11:18,090 --> 00:11:21,780
to control drug prices Bernie Sanders
seems to be offering a plan that would

154
00:11:21,780 --> 00:11:26,030
do that why does the president not
support I'm pretty sure that it's not

155
00:11:26,030 --> 00:11:30,360
only does the president not support it
but America doesn't support it or Bernie

156
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:32,760
Sanders would be sitting in the Oval
Office right now

157
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:36,990
he pushed these ideas forward during the
campaign they were rejected not just by

158
00:11:36,990 --> 00:11:40,260
America but Democrats he didn't make it
through the primary he didn't make it

159
00:11:40,260 --> 00:11:43,830
into the oval I think that's a pretty
clear indication of what America wants

160
00:11:43,830 --> 00:11:47,900
to see and it's not a single-payer
system

161
00:12:00,590 --> 00:12:05,210
they're thinking is that the president
would also be meeting with ranking

162
00:12:05,210 --> 00:12:10,499
members were the minority members on
and on the Finance Committee in advance

163
00:12:10,499 --> 00:12:14,879
of the disclosure of the consensus
outline that's going to come out at the

164
00:12:14,879 --> 00:12:20,430
end of September can you describe the
president's view about how to create a

165
00:12:20,430 --> 00:12:25,649
bipartisan tax plan does he want to get
ideas from Democrats or does he just

166
00:12:25,649 --> 00:12:31,740
want Democrats to buy in to the plan
that Brady and hatch well I think just

167
00:12:31,740 --> 00:12:35,670
by a mere fact that he's been sitting
down both yesterday and today with

168
00:12:35,670 --> 00:12:39,959
multiple members of the Democrat Party
shows that he wants to have that

169
00:12:39,959 --> 00:12:43,350
conversation with them I don't think you
can make that any more clear than to

170
00:12:43,350 --> 00:12:48,619
have those ongoing conversations with
multiple members of the Democrat Party

171
00:12:56,149 --> 00:13:02,100
precision what kind of additional aid
might be necessary to address the

172
00:13:02,100 --> 00:13:08,330
destruction in Florida in terms of
congressman we're still in the recovery

173
00:13:08,330 --> 00:13:11,480
efforts right now and until we get a
little bit further into the process it

174
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:15,230
would be premature to put those
estimates out there particularly with

175
00:13:15,230 --> 00:13:20,360
precision I would imagine that that
takes us a good bit more time and once

176
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:23,060
we have those numbers we'll let you know
thank you sir

177
00:13:23,060 --> 00:13:28,490
I'd like to ask the United States is
spearheading a meeting at the UN of

178
00:13:28,490 --> 00:13:33,710
Monday on UN reform could you give me
some specifics on what the United States

179
00:13:33,710 --> 00:13:37,430
hopes to accomplish in that meeting
we're not I'm not gonna get ahead of the

180
00:13:37,430 --> 00:13:41,600
meetings that are gonna take place but I
can tell you that on Friday general

181
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:45,740
McMaster and ambassador Haley will be
here at the briefing to talk in more

182
00:13:45,740 --> 00:13:49,970
detail about the UN General Assembly
events and meetings that will take place

183
00:13:49,970 --> 00:13:55,940
next week thanks a lot Sarah two
questions on just a follow-up to the

184
00:13:55,940 --> 00:14:00,710
president's meeting that he had with
Senator Scott this morning after the

185
00:14:00,710 --> 00:14:04,520
president's response to that white
supremacist rally in Charlottesville

186
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:11,120
senator Scott said that presidents Trump
moral authority was compromised in terms

187
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:15,589
of the conversation that they had does
the president understand what troubled

188
00:14:15,589 --> 00:14:21,050
senator Scott in regards to his response
they had a very open and honest

189
00:14:21,050 --> 00:14:25,790
conversation and committed to continuing
those conversations and making sure that

190
00:14:25,790 --> 00:14:29,390
today was just the first step of many of
those meetings where I think that'll be

191
00:14:29,390 --> 00:14:33,620
an ongoing process and ongoing
conversation that they have tax reform

192
00:14:33,620 --> 00:14:37,970
with the meeting that's taking place
this evening with Democratic leaders

193
00:14:37,970 --> 00:14:42,680
from Congress Oh what has been the
reaction that you've seen from the

194
00:14:42,680 --> 00:14:46,940
supporters that were on board the sort
of the Trump bandwagon from the start

195
00:14:46,940 --> 00:14:51,080
this new tack that the president is
taking in reaching out to Democrats this

196
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:54,380
was something that the president talked
about on the campaign trail of being a

197
00:14:54,380 --> 00:14:58,670
good deal maker and being able to sit
down with members of both sides and be

198
00:14:58,670 --> 00:15:03,290
able to bring a deal and bring good
legislation for the American people this

199
00:15:03,290 --> 00:15:08,660
isn't new and people listened and heard
the President and certainly supported

200
00:15:08,660 --> 00:15:11,270
him and that's why he's here today John
Gizzi

201
00:15:11,270 --> 00:15:18,560
Thank You Sara two different questions
on two subjects first your earlier

202
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:24,649
remarks about the nature of repeal and
replace legislation would seem to rule

203
00:15:24,649 --> 00:15:29,959
out the White House support or a
flat-out repeal which is favored by many

204
00:15:29,959 --> 00:15:36,529
Republican House members are you ruling
our discouraging a flat-out repeal major

205
00:15:36,529 --> 00:15:40,700
first we haven't we haven't ruled out
anything that helps move this process

206
00:15:40,700 --> 00:15:46,279
forward we're grateful for the efforts
that are continuing in Congress and we

207
00:15:46,279 --> 00:15:49,399
hope that they do what they campaigned
on and what they promised the American

208
00:15:49,399 --> 00:15:53,450
people they would do and that's not just
repeal but it's also replaced I think

209
00:15:53,450 --> 00:15:57,350
both of those parts are very important
moving forward though the president

210
00:15:57,350 --> 00:16:02,920
recently appointed 42 new US attorneys
and it's been reported fairly widely

211
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:09,080
that only one of them was woman the US
Attorney for the District of Columbia

212
00:16:09,080 --> 00:16:15,800
Joyce Vance former democratic appointed
US Attorney in Alabama called this and I

213
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:20,899
quote a slap in the face on for what is
the reaction of the White House to that

214
00:16:20,899 --> 00:16:26,089
comment on his wave of appointment
attorneys I think that the president has

215
00:16:26,089 --> 00:16:30,850
certainly surrounded himself with a lot
of strong women in various positions

216
00:16:30,850 --> 00:16:36,440
including myself in a pretty high
position and senior position in the

217
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:41,720
administration as well as hope Hicks
Kellyanne Conway a number of others he's

218
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:46,670
continuing to add women to his staff at
senior levels every single day and I

219
00:16:46,670 --> 00:16:50,270
think that's a very positive step
forward concerning particularly in the

220
00:16:50,270 --> 00:16:54,200
communications it's the first time in
history that's happened Trevor thanks

221
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:58,730
thanks Sarah it was reported today that
Mike Flynn jr. is the subject of a

222
00:16:58,730 --> 00:17:03,230
federal investigation into election
meddling is the president concerned that

223
00:17:03,230 --> 00:17:06,949
someone who served on his transition
team is now the subject of a federal

224
00:17:06,949 --> 00:17:09,709
investigation I haven't had a
conversation with him about that but I'd

225
00:17:09,709 --> 00:17:13,699
refer you to outside counsel on but a
comment that Hillary Clinton made this

226
00:17:13,699 --> 00:17:17,209
morning she said that she wish President
Trump was the president for all

227
00:17:17,209 --> 00:17:20,279
Americans
give any reaction to this

228
00:17:20,279 --> 00:17:24,919
characterization of the president's role
in the White House I think that type of

229
00:17:24,919 --> 00:17:29,759
misunderstanding of who this president
is and frankly a misunderstanding of

230
00:17:29,759 --> 00:17:35,249
what he's been doing is exactly one of
the reasons that Hillary Clinton is not

231
00:17:35,249 --> 00:17:40,980
the president and is instead pushing a
book with a lot of false narratives and

232
00:17:40,980 --> 00:17:45,960
a lot of I think false accusations and
and placing blame on a lot of other

233
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:49,429
people instead of accepting it herself

234
00:17:49,769 --> 00:17:54,179
a little over a week ago of the Canada
US and Mexico I suppose the second round

235
00:17:54,179 --> 00:17:57,830
don't stop the second round of
negotiations on Africa I'm not tough I

236
00:17:57,830 --> 00:18:02,309
next round in 10 days in Ottawa has the
president been briefed on the second

237
00:18:02,309 --> 00:18:06,989
round is he happy with the result is if
it was great and is it still considering

238
00:18:06,989 --> 00:18:11,489
canceling the entire agreement those
negotiations are still ongoing and a

239
00:18:11,489 --> 00:18:14,669
final decision hasn't been made and
they're going to continue to push

240
00:18:14,669 --> 00:18:19,259
forward to make sure that the best deal
possible for Americans and American

241
00:18:19,259 --> 00:18:22,129
workers happens

242
00:18:24,999 --> 00:18:29,019
I'm not sure I'm not aware of any
conversation that's taking place and

243
00:18:29,019 --> 00:18:33,969
quite a long time so and I also want to
ask about tonight's dinner why not also

244
00:18:33,969 --> 00:18:37,839
invite Mitch McConnell and Paul Ryan oh
look you've got the leader of the

245
00:18:37,839 --> 00:18:42,609
Republican Party sitting at the table
this is the president's opportunity to

246
00:18:42,609 --> 00:18:47,979
have a very open and honest conversation
with members of the Senate and I think

247
00:18:47,979 --> 00:18:51,029
anybody that tries to distort it into
something other than that is just

248
00:18:51,029 --> 00:18:54,939
misunderstanding what the purpose is I
don't want to get it wrong either - are

249
00:18:54,939 --> 00:18:57,909
you saying that if Mitch McConnell Paul
Ryan were there then that conversation

250
00:18:57,909 --> 00:19:01,719
would be distorted yeah that's not what
I'm saying at all I'm saying that if

251
00:19:01,719 --> 00:19:06,209
anybody thinks that the Republican
viewpoint isn't being represented is

252
00:19:06,209 --> 00:19:10,599
completely misunderstanding that the
president is the leader of the

253
00:19:10,599 --> 00:19:18,119
Republican Party
so is the president negotiating

254
00:19:19,739 --> 00:19:23,619
presidents negotiated on behalf of the
American people exactly what he was

255
00:19:23,619 --> 00:19:28,419
elected to do and the idea that you guys
keep trying to distort this into a bad

256
00:19:28,419 --> 00:19:33,159
thing is I think exactly why this
president was elected they were sick and

257
00:19:33,159 --> 00:19:37,659
tired of business as usual they wanted
somebody who would break up the status

258
00:19:37,659 --> 00:19:41,019
quo that would bring people from both
sides of the table together to have

259
00:19:41,019 --> 00:19:44,769
conversations this president's done more
for bipartisanship in the last eight

260
00:19:44,769 --> 00:19:48,629
days than Obama did in eight years

261
00:19:53,420 --> 00:19:58,900
what are the topics were on the table
with the president yaaaa

262
00:19:58,900 --> 00:20:06,650
they talked about tax reform they talked
about moving to a looking at different

263
00:20:06,650 --> 00:20:11,090
ways to bring the country together and
about continuing ongoing conversations

264
00:20:11,090 --> 00:20:15,290
making sure that they stayed in constant
contact with one another and having a

265
00:20:15,290 --> 00:20:19,190
pretty open and regular conversation
conversations about HBCUs in this

266
00:20:19,190 --> 00:20:25,160
meeting and HBCUs were not discussed in
the midday today and sources saying that

267
00:20:25,160 --> 00:20:29,840
there was a conversation about a request
from black Republicans to have a

268
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:34,610
high-ranking black Republican within
this administration who knows issues and

269
00:20:34,610 --> 00:20:39,020
understands how to how Washington up and
down Pennsylvania Avenue works

270
00:20:39,020 --> 00:20:43,820
was that a conversation in this meeting
there's certainly conversations about

271
00:20:43,820 --> 00:20:49,850
adding additional personnel that can tap
into the african-american community that

272
00:20:49,850 --> 00:20:53,600
did come up so where did that where did
that go

273
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:56,540
what did the president say about a
commitment to absolutely work with

274
00:20:56,540 --> 00:21:01,820
Senator Scott to look to do exactly that
and for the two of them to continue to

275
00:21:01,820 --> 00:21:05,270
have those conversations for his
viewpoints to continue to be expressed

276
00:21:05,270 --> 00:21:09,980
directly to the president certain issues
are certain people as it related to that

277
00:21:09,980 --> 00:21:19,130
topic about bringing these specific
people didn't come up like corporate tax

278
00:21:19,130 --> 00:21:22,610
rate of 15 percent however Stephen
ushion yesterday said I don't know if we

279
00:21:22,610 --> 00:21:26,060
will be able to achieve that given the
budget issues you were asked about mr.

280
00:21:26,060 --> 00:21:29,570
venusian comments you said the president
is prepared to push for lower rate as we

281
00:21:29,570 --> 00:21:33,260
can get however Mick Mulvaney said today
that he had spoken to the president and

282
00:21:33,260 --> 00:21:38,150
the president was adamant about a 15%
rate so is the official position from

283
00:21:38,150 --> 00:21:43,160
the administration that a 15% rate needs
to happen or that all of this is subject

284
00:21:43,160 --> 00:21:47,210
to negotiation the 15 percent has been
the goal it's always been the goal we're

285
00:21:47,210 --> 00:21:52,790
going to continue pushing for that that
certainly hasn't changed secondly with

286
00:21:52,790 --> 00:21:55,610
working with or at least talking tonight
we're

287
00:21:55,610 --> 00:21:59,390
Pelosi and Schumer one of the things
that they want is not one penny their

288
00:21:59,390 --> 00:22:04,790
campaign to the wealthiest Americans
that is a marker that they have drawn in

289
00:22:04,790 --> 00:22:09,440
the sand at this point is the president
open to not having tax cuts as deep as

290
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:12,710
once were maybe thought for the
wealthiest of Americans again the

291
00:22:12,710 --> 00:22:16,100
president's focus has never been on the
wealthiest of Americans it's been on tax

292
00:22:16,100 --> 00:22:20,390
cuts for the middle class and tax reform
as a whole that continues to be his

293
00:22:20,390 --> 00:22:28,610
priority and will in tonight's
discussion come through one is just

294
00:22:28,610 --> 00:22:32,630
since you raised the issue mrs.
Clinton's book having a false narrative

295
00:22:32,630 --> 00:22:37,549
and false accusations could you point us
to a couple specific accusations in the

296
00:22:37,549 --> 00:22:39,679
book that you believe are factually
incorrect

297
00:22:39,679 --> 00:22:43,850
I think the probably the biggest one is
any place within the book where she lays

298
00:22:43,850 --> 00:22:50,660
blame for the loss on anyone but herself
separate topic the President issued a

299
00:22:50,660 --> 00:22:54,020
strong statement the other day on
Myanmar and the persecution of the

300
00:22:54,020 --> 00:22:57,679
minority Muslim population I know that
topic came up at his meeting yesterday

301
00:22:57,679 --> 00:23:03,230
with the Malaysian I'm wondering whether
the president feels that Ansan suci as a

302
00:23:03,230 --> 00:23:07,490
figure of great moral stature and the de
facto leader of that country should be

303
00:23:07,490 --> 00:23:11,809
more forthright in condemning what's
happening in that part of her country I

304
00:23:11,809 --> 00:23:18,110
think anytime anyone sees something like
that taking place a public condemnation

305
00:23:18,110 --> 00:23:22,220
is certainly appropriate we're gonna
continue working with our allies and

306
00:23:22,220 --> 00:23:28,429
partners to be part of the process in
whatever way we can moving forward

307
00:23:28,429 --> 00:23:32,780
yes you mentioned a couple times today
was for the emphasize diversity in the

308
00:23:32,780 --> 00:23:36,290
West Wing I talked about the president
being very clear after charlottesville

309
00:23:36,290 --> 00:23:39,380
and announcing all he and I just want to
read a comment from a influential

310
00:23:39,380 --> 00:23:41,920
African American sportscaster from ESPN
yesterday

311
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:45,280
that Donald Trump is a white supremacist
who has largely surrounded himself with

312
00:23:45,280 --> 00:23:49,750
other white supremacist is rise in
direct result of white supremacy period

313
00:23:49,750 --> 00:23:53,290
he's unqualified n fit to be President
why do you think give a reaction to that

314
00:23:53,290 --> 00:23:56,770
is our president aware of that comment
and I'm not sure if he's aware but I

315
00:23:56,770 --> 00:24:00,730
think that's one of the more outrageous
comments that anyone could make and

316
00:24:00,730 --> 00:24:05,050
certainly something that I think is a
fireable offense by ESPN the president

317
00:24:05,050 --> 00:24:09,610
was so clear and he said why do you
think influential African American

318
00:24:09,610 --> 00:24:13,300
figures are saying things like I'm not
gonna speak for that individual but I

319
00:24:13,300 --> 00:24:17,500
did I know that the president has met
again with people like Senator Scott who

320
00:24:17,500 --> 00:24:21,340
are highly respected leaders in the
african-american community he's

321
00:24:21,340 --> 00:24:24,580
committed to working with them to bring
the country together I think that's

322
00:24:24,580 --> 00:24:28,210
where we need to be focused not on
outrageous statements like that one

323
00:24:28,210 --> 00:24:37,120
continue to do that relationship in the
last eight days

324
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:42,870
these years are you basing that off of
reading seconds hell

325
00:24:43,049 --> 00:24:46,289
I'm basing that on the fact that he's
actually willing to sit down with

326
00:24:46,289 --> 00:24:50,580
members of the opposite party something
that President Obama rarely did and

327
00:24:50,580 --> 00:24:54,960
certainly didn't listen to members of
the opposite party I can't think of a

328
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:57,989
single time where he made a deal with
anybody from the opposite side of the

329
00:24:57,989 --> 00:25:04,049
you know from anybody beyond the
Democrat Party and the again this

330
00:25:04,049 --> 00:25:06,989
president is committed to doing that he
hasn't just done it once but he's

331
00:25:06,989 --> 00:25:10,559
continuing to do that as we move into
one of the most ambitious legislative

332
00:25:10,559 --> 00:25:14,100
agendas that we've had in a long time
and we're committed to working with

333
00:25:14,100 --> 00:25:18,480
Democrats he's both stated that publicly
and in these meetings that he's going to

334
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:24,119
continue to have the president believe
is a mistake not to have invested more

335
00:25:24,119 --> 00:25:27,989
time and energy in the Schumer closer
relationship at an earlier stage in his

336
00:25:27,989 --> 00:25:32,639
term I don't think so I think that right
now we're at a critical time where we

337
00:25:32,639 --> 00:25:37,109
have some big things on the agenda tax
reform responsible immigration reform

338
00:25:37,109 --> 00:25:41,009
he's committed to working again with
both Republicans and Democrats to push

339
00:25:41,009 --> 00:25:44,609
those through and hopes that they'll
come on board to do that thanks so much

340
00:25:44,609 --> 00:00:00,000
guys the president will be having an
event here in just momentarily thank you
