the president signs that into law just before Christmas and then he says that he's gonna have a working vacation I hope not I hope the president just takes the time off what's the media Fester you know he doesn't he doesn't need to provide them content let them chew on all of the good things that are happening because of this tax cut so there is an additional list we gave you a list yesterday of corporations they're now giving bonuses and raises to people and hiring more people because of the tax cut that just passed the Senate and the house and was signed into law by the president in Texas New Braunfels based rush enterprises is planning to give each of its employees a $1,000 bonus after President Trump signs the tax reform bill into law the commercial truck dealer said all of its approximately 6600 US employees will receive the one-time payout which will cost about six point six million dollars in Wisconsin Associated Bank said it would boost its minimum hourly wage to fifteen bucks and pay workers a $500 bonus their current minimum wage is $10 an hour so that's a fight that's a fifty percent increase the company said that its moves would affect about three thousand employees in Idaho Melaleuca Inc which is run by frank van der Sloot's an Anderson Republican he said in a phone interview that his 2,000 workers would get a one-time bonus from a hundred bucks for every year they worked at the company they have about 150 employees who have worked there for twenty years or more the average employee will get about an $800 bonus in Hawaii the Royal Hawaiian heritage jewelry that they've decided to open a second shop and there's gonna happen all over the place right then there's gonna happen as businesses decide they have more money to spend then hiring should go up investment should go up even their stock buybacks maybe jester stocks go up but it's good for the economy when people get to keep their own dollars why because they get to spend those dollars they invest those dollars and you know what you want to buy better than the federal government knows what you want to buy now the left has lost their mind over the tax cut obviously they just can't deal with it and it's really interesting because it sort of betrays what they actually think of America and what they think of your capacity to keep your own money so Elizabeth Warren for example you know she has an interesting take her basic notion here is the reason corporations are now giving bonuses and raises is because they're trying to propagandize to their workers not because they actually like their workers or help their workers they have nefarious motives all of the corporations are essentially evil in the end they'll just use that money to line their own pockets and give the selves big bonuses that's what they'll do they're cruel and plutocratic here's Elizabeth Warren sending a few smoke signals of her own I want to be absolutely clear I am delighted when workers get more money I'm glad when it happens at any corporation in America yay but let's be really clear if these corporations had wanted to do that they already had plenty of profits to do it the idea that this is trickle-down economics at work rather than just plain old politics it's just wrong the corporate CEOs have already told us what they're going to do with this money give you an example Home Depot right after the Senate passed the tax bill a couple of weeks ago Home Depot CEO is executive is interviewed instead so what are you gonna do with all of this money that Home Depot has because they're going to do really well on this was it we're gonna raise wages for our employees mmm no why is it we're going to hire more employees at the Home Depot stores no our was it we're going to build more Home Depot's across America um no they said what we're gonna do is we're going to do stop buybacks in other words we're going to use whatever money comes in to pump up the price of our stock okay so what's hilarious about this is number one the Democrats were claiming for years that the stock market growth of the Obama administration was clearly a reflection of his underlying solid economy except the job growth didn't keep up because the stocks were actually stock buybacks right now she's ripping stock buyback stock buybacks are terrible but the idea here is that corporations are nefarious their profit seeking isn't that awful now hilarious is the same folks who think that corporations are profit seeking and evil number one I don't know if they've ever met anyone who runs a corporation okay I help run a corporation right I along with my executive team the people I work with the presidents of the company and the CEO the CEO of the company you know we run the company together we actually do care about our employees if you went to our Christmas party yesterday the only employee who got a bad gift in our Christmas party was Michael Knowles because he's a bad employee right he got coal that I gave him for Christmas but aside from that it was in a Tiffany's box so I guess it was nice a little bit and one day if Michael really puts himself under pressure that coal will become a diamond it was actually in there's me exhorting him to work but everybody at the company is relatively happy because we are interested in keeping them employed and if they are good at their jobs we give them raises and if they're good at their jobs we retain them and if they're bad at their jobs we fire them people don't want to fire people okay they actually don't people are not generally in the business of enjoying firing people and corporations actually do care about their workers which is why wages have risen in the United States in terms of what you can buy they've risen in the United States continuously despite the death of private sector unions private sector unions represent something like 3 percent of the workforce now they barely exist all of the unions exist in the public sector where they're unionizing against the government but in the private sector people have decided that they're gonna have better luck instead of unionizing just going and talking to their employer about arrays which is correct but the idea from the from the left is precisely the reverse corporations are cruel they hate you they want to harm you they want to use you as a slave labor but the government is benevolent so it's benevolent when the government comes to me and takes a gun out and points it at me and says give me your money that's benevolent but and if the mutton if the government gives me my own money back then that's bad that's bad because you know that's redistributing the wealth but if a corporation is working and giving bonuses and keeping people employed then somehow they're cruel now here's the thing I think most people are motivated by self-interest the difference is that in a capitalist economy my self-interest does not manifest as anything good for me unless I give something to you capitalism turns self-interest into what I have called for stala ISM the point being that I can be as selfish as I want but if I don't produce a good or service that you like I'm gonna starve hey that's the beauty of the capitalist free-market system government has no such qualms government has no such issues if government wants to survive government can't go bankrupt it will just bankrupt you it will take all your money all your children's money if we're gonna talk about caring levels versus corporations versus government corporations care a hell of a lot more about making sure that you are employed as long as you are doing work for them then the government cares no more than care at all the government will just tax the hell out of you if you earn and they'll give you money if you don't because the government is interested in your dependency or in sucking money out of your pocket those are the only two things the government is interested in on a fiscal level either taking your money or turning you into a dependent those are the only two things government is not interested in boosting you or giving you a hand up you know the Democrats will say we would just wanna give you a handout because to hand up then and then they promote policies that make sure that people stay in poverty they pay people to stay off the work lines right they want welfare increased so that people don't have to work jobs this is why you have Nancy Pelosi saying things like we want to make sure that you are not burdened by job lock lately you're not locked into a job you don't want to do okay that fundamental difference between how you view private industry and how you view government undergirds this entire thing and in a second I do want to discuss what happened at the UN as a major development to over at the UN yesterday with nikki Haley really taking charge but first I want to say thank you to our sponsors over at us CCA so if you're a gun lover it's time for you to listen up how would you like to head to the range tomorrow with a brand new gun I know you would it's Christmas time folks I know I would too well my friends over at the

three.com go check it out USC c8 does a lot of fantastic work you should register with them in any case okay so yesterday as I said nikki Haley acting as my spirit animal and she was at the UN the UN votes 128 to nine against the United States moving our embassy to jerusalem's which we say go to hell who cares what you have to say why in the world when I care that Yemen doesn't want us to move our embassy to Jerusalem and Yemen can kiss our ass who cares answer no one no one okay and nikki Haley made that pretty clear she basically looked at the entire UN and she said guys you think I'm standing here like caring about what you guys have to say welcome to murica Nikki hailey doing yeoman's work over at the UN it's always weird whenever people speak at the UN it looks like they're speaking in the bathroom of the Macy's right Meg there's there's Nikki hailey really bashing people about the head United States is by far the single largest contributor to the United Nations and its agencies when a nation is singled out for attack in this organization that nation is disrespected what's more that nation is asked to pay for the privilege of being disrespected the United States will remember this day in which it was singled out for attack in the General Assembly for the very act of exercising our right as a sovereign nation we will remember it when we are called upon to once again make the world's largest contribution to the United Nations and we will remember it when so many countries come calling on us as they so often do to pay even more and to use our influence for their benefit cut them off cut them off cut them off okay none of these countries that are voting against the United States ought to take their foreign aid for granted now there are two types of foreign aid that the United States grant it represents foreign aid by the way about 1% of the American federal budget every year what's breaking the bank is not foreign aid but we can use this as a tool you know we give it like a hundred million dollars is in Bob way every year like in human and development aid in health and development it we give a true it says something 135 million dollars every year to Zimbabwe which was until five minutes ago run by Robert Mugabe one of the worst people on planet earth there been studies that show that foreign aid does virtually nothing when he's trying to check to a dictator the dictator takes the check immediately cashes it builds himself a new palace buys himself a couple of new female bodyguards and then goes about his daily business by stopping the bodyguards and and murdering his own people four and eight unless it is specifically to the right areas doesn't do a whole hell of a lot and the UN doesn't do a whole hell of a lot the idea of attaching strings to the system makes a lot of sense now what's funny is that there are people on the Left who don't believe this so Philip Mudd is one of these people he's a you know his name is mud literally and he he actually says this on CNN he said he said that Trump was acting in the form of diplomatic prostitution he said let me be blunt here wolf he said this to Wolf Blitzer this is diplomatic prostitution we're telling people unless you vote with us we're not going to give you money and if your heart doesn't agree with American policies we're not gonna support you in terms of USA that's not prostitution it's just called diplomacy like we actually get to attach strings to the checks that we sign to people it's true everywhere by the way it's true in domestic policy too no such thing as a free lunch internationally or nationally and by the but what this really betrays is that there are a lot of people in the United States living in the United States who do not actually see the United States as a force for good in the world they don't they see it as a bad thing they see it as a bad thing when we exert our power in the world that's because there are really two different views of America on the world stage view number one is that America is a big bully this was Barack Obama's view and his apology tour early on in his presidency in America is the big bully on the world stage were mean to people and cruel were overreaching were sort of bull in a china shop sure we try to do the right thing but we usually do the wrong thing and then there is the more traditional and correct view of America's role in the world which is that we are the greatest force for freedom the world has ever seen and ever known in fact is where American boots have set foot freedom follows I'm not gonna talk about whether we should have been in every war that we've been in but where America was present there was freedom and where America was removed at the freedom went away this is true in Vietnam where when we pulled out of Vietnam South Vietnam and South Vietnam a free country turns into a communist tell Ho so does Cambodia in Cambodia where they were the Khmer Rouge and at murdering a million people right when we when we pull out of Korea out of North Korea North Korea is still a prison camp 60 odd years later in South Korea where we still have troops is one of the freest most prosperous countries in Asia forget about your upper I mean all of Europe would be speaking German right now for one for the United States including Britain so the idea that the United States has been nefarious force on the world stage that we have strings attached we should have strings attached because our strings are good and our strings are usually things like we would like you to free up your press we would like you to not oppress women we would like for you to support United States foreign policy in strengthening our interests around the world this is good stuff the United States has never conquered nations to take them the United States has conquered nations in order to place regimes with better regimes ask how that's gone for Japan and Germany the answer is pretty well and by the way it was going a lot better in Iraq until President Obama decided to precipitously withdraw from Iraq leaving in his wake an Iranian backed regime and Isis in the in the west of the country in the northwest of the country so this view that the United States is being terrible by attaching strings to our funds it's my money for God's sake it's my money so it's my money then I get to determine what happens with it this notion that the government has a role in taking my money and then spending it on whatever stupid thing Robert Mugabe wants to spend it on it verges on taxation without representation is the truth now one of the things that's always interesting is the the UN votes as I talked about yesterday statistically insanely and routinely all the time they they vote against Israel and a huge percentage of all the votes they've ever taken in the own General Assembly are against Israel and the people who vote against Israel are typically there are a lot of people who abstain yesterday the people who voted against Israel are largely located in areas with large Muslim populations Europe or in the Muslim world itself so they're the voted I say it 128 to 9 so 57 of those countries were Islamic so half of them right off the bat our Muslim countries that hate Israel and don't believe that it ought to exist and then there are another 50 odd countries and some of those are in Asia and some of those are in Europe and what you are seeing is this alliance between members of the European left and radical Islam to condemn Israel all right this is where anti-semitism exists I've talked about anti-semitism before on the program there are a few different types there's religious anti-semitism which is sort of Muslim anti-semitism at this point there's still some Christian anti-semitism but that's become far less of a problem over the last 50 years since the Holocaust in Auroville a 70 years since the Holocaust rather there is Muslim anti-semitism some religious anti-semitism there's also secular anti-semitism in the form of people who do not like Christianity do not like Judaism they're okay with Islam because Islam makes them feel a multicultural and special and warm inside but they're not big on the on the unit and this coming out in Europe so there's a piece in USA Today talking about Germany Germany voted against the United the United States moving our embassy to Jerusalem again none of their damn business again they be speaking Hitler if it weren't for us but the idea that Germany is is going to tell Israel a country full of Jews right about the same population of Jews come to think of it as we're slaughtered in the Holocaust by the Germans and their allies that they're going to tell Israel where to put their capital is beyond absurd the anti-semitism in Germany is on the rise in Europe it's on the rise so if you wonder if Israel if the anti-israel motivation is caused by anti-semitism the answer is yes European anti-semitism has long roots now there's a lot of European anti-semitism that's based off of new Muslim migrants and also secular leftists who believe that Israel is a nefarious force for Western imperialism so there's peace in USA Today when telecommunications manager Mikhail Tenaya emigrated to Germany in 1998 from his native Russia as a teen his Jewish faith didn't matter to classmates her neighbors but now he says when I arrived in Germany I never saw such displays but now there are thousands of people for burning Israeli flags in the streets in 2006 Germany recorded 1,500 anti-semitic incidents that was a massive increase from previous years according to a recent survey in western Germany 62 percent of Jewish respondents said they experienced anti-semitism in their everyday lives 28 percent said there were victims of verbal attacks or harassment in the past year when I visited France my wife and I were afraid to go in particular districts while I was wearing a yarmulke I wore a baseball cap instead when I was in London I think I've told this story on the show when I was in London there was a situation where we went to Madame Tussauds Wax Museum we're walking around looking at all the statues no Jewish statues right except for Albert Einstein and behind us there's a group of young Muslims you can tell cuz the woman's wearing a hijab she ran by two guys who are who also looked like they are from Muslim countries and they actually walk up to the Statue of Albert Einstein start strangling it and I figured well maybe they just don't like the theory of relativity turns out not there's also a wax statue of Hitler and while every British person there was walking over and strangling Hitler these young Muslims went over and put their arms around Hitler like he was uncle Hitler and began taking pictures anti-semitism on the rise there it's on the rise in places like Sweden not just because of radical Islam but also because of a secular movement that sees religious education as backwards and non progressive Nordic countries maintain opinion corridors for acceptable ideas in the public square and those opinion corridors do not include religious people very often so anti-semitism anti-israel sentiment it may be true that not everyone anti-israel is anti-semitic but everyone anti-semitic is certainly anti-israel and there is pretty significant crossover between the two groups okay well as we continue I want to get to the mailbag I want to do a particularly long mail back it's a year-end mailbag now and give you a chance but

life okay so I'm not gonna do things I like things I hate in the mail bag today instead I'm gonna do lots and lots of mail bag game we're just gonna mail bag it up yo so we'll jump right in and we'll take your live questions as well so everything will be everything will be fascinating and we will go through as many questions as possible before the end of the year so we begin with Makayla she says dear Ben every time the Republicans talk about taxes Chuck Schumer comes out and explains that trickle-down economics have never worked I've googled this to try and find proof that it has in order to educate my brainwash fellow Millennials to no avail could you please explain in an objective way the actual pros and cons of trickle-down economics and when it has actually shown growth so the reason that first of all let's start with a problem with Google if you google trickle-down economics you are only gonna get the failures of trickle-down economics that's because it's a quote a term that was not coined by the right it was a term that was coined by the left those right calls it supply-side economics book up supply-side economics on Google and you will come up with a myriad of examples in which supply-side economics has worked supply-side economics is the idea that if you give producers back their money they're going to produce new and better products and that generates its own demand supply generates its own demand basically so if you generate cheaper product not crap nobody wants to buy but if you make products cheaper and better people will want to buy it if you invent new products that changes the way people live everybody wants to buy it 15 years ago 20 20 years ago nobody never heard of an iPhone now everyone has one that's because of supply side Apple created a product you wanted the product you went out and bought the product what the Left likes is what they call demand side economics demand side economics is the idea but if you give a bunch of money to a bunch of people that they'll spend that money and that will jog the economy it won't jog the economy in the sense of making people's lives better generally because the products aren't gonna get any better right the point being that maybe here's the great distinction if you have a million dollars you give it to let's say that all else is equal right nobody has a million dollars we're not talking about and we're not talking about equality now we're just talking about jogging the economy talk about efficiency you have a million dollars you give a million dollars to Bill Gates to invest in the building and invention of new product nor do you give a million dollars $1 to a bunch of people so they go spending on a burger which is gonna make the economy better the answer is you give the million dollars to Bill Gates the reason is that Bill Gates is then going to create a product that makes everybody's life better that will create a bunch of new jobs in a growing area where people are opting for the product that's not a case for impoverishing people of course but the point that I am making is that producers businesses change the economy at disproportionate levels right so supply-side economics has generated success after the JFK tax cuts generated economic success after the Reagan tax cuts in eighty-one generated economic success after the bush tax cuts of 2001 there was sustained economic growth people tend to forget this because of the crash in 2007-2008 and even Barack Obama maintained tax rates in 2010 and 2013 so supply-side economics does indeed work it's worked in Europe it's the reason why Denmark for example is now cutting its own taxes it's why European countries that have spent too much money are cutting their own taxes so don't Google trickle-down that's it's a nonsense term made down made up by the left the idea would be that people at the top of companies are just gonna give the money to their employees that's not correct that's not how trickle-down works right supply-side means that you're creating new products and services and in the course of doing so it creates jobs Tina says hi my husband just bought me a Christmas present a subscription to The Daily wire yay well thank you your husband's awesome what a great husband you should probably give him a ring I do have a burning question are your kids as smart and analytical as you in other words is there hopefully my children's generation and how can we battle the liberal teachers school school districts that are brainwashing our kids six hours a day well as far as the brainwashing from the schools I would suggest private school homeschooling take over your local school board you really do have to be very very involved as far as are my kids are smart analytical as I am my three and a half year old it's hard to tell when for the one to half year old boy because that suits just am I mean he's just running around the whole time like I haven't seen a lot of analysis from him other than know and also cheese he really likes cheese but aside from that he I mean he he's he's obviously a very smart kid he's really highly developed in terms of language my daughter is brilliant leah is is super smart my son may be brilliant I just don't know yet he's not speaking full sentences she is really really intelligent I mean she's four she's not even four she's already started her violin lessons she can essentially read she she knows her numbers and she her thought processes are all quite rational so she's she's very smart okay Arya says hi Ben what do you think Trump can do at this point to maintain the House and Senate next year okay so what Trump can do is shut up I mean nothing is what Trump has to do Trump needs to be quiet well because if he keeps talking it makes him more unpopular also he needs to go out and talk about his accomplishments he needs to he needs to go out and talk about how to unify Americans he can have fun but I think that it's a mistake for him to I think it's a big mistake for him to go on Twitter and use Twitter the way that he has the past year I'm hoping that we're beginning to see some discipline from Trump listen there will be losses in the house but those losses can be mitigated if yeah climate continues to be good and if Trump can make himself less unpopular he's never gonna be super popular he's never gonna get up to 55% in the approval ratings but right now according to I think was Rasmussen this morning's up to 44 if he can get that up to 47 48 he'll do fine and Republicans will do fine okay Emanuel says any word back about the rosy harassment so what he is referring to is that today sadly Rosie O'Donnell has some sort of sad obsessions had sexual obsession with me which is horrifying in every conceivable way and she tweeted out yes I told you yesterday that she tweeted that she wanted me to suck her bleep but her bleep was a male genitalia which is weird and I responded that she should stop being homophobic and sexually harassing people me too and then she and then she tweeted again today that she wanted me to lick her which to which I tweeted no means no Rosie you know and all victims have a right to be believed hashtag me too and and then I reported her to Twitter not because I actually want her banned from Twitter suspended from Twitter as I've said before I didn't want Milo banned or suspended from Twitter I think that if I were running a place I pretty much wouldn't suspend anybody except for explicitly violent behavior but I do want to see if Twitter is just going to have a radical double standard right if they're gonna ban people on the right for saying stuff like Rosie said like if I'd said that to Rosie is there any question they would have suspended her ban Bay no question none Rosie says it to me totally fine so we will find out rosie has blocked me so I guess that she has moved on from her sexual obsession so that's that's sad it's it's sad that number one it was unrequited number two don't sexually harass people she did her parting shot to me was something to the effect of she didn't even know who I was but I look like a little boy so which eye responds and then why are you sexually propositioning a little boy because that's that's creepy and terrible okay I my twitter was pretty fired this week okay so Nathan says hey Ben looking good today thank you sir of course he says how would you define Zionism and do you consider yourself a Zionist thanks bro yes I consider myself a Zionist Zionism is the idea that the that the Jews deserve a state of their own in biblical Israel I'm a Zionist because I am a Jew and Jews like a Jew who believes in Judaism not because ethnically Jewish and Judaism is a Zionist religion that suggests that there should be Jewish rule in the Holy Land and that it was a biblical promise now what's interesting is people take that to mean that there has to be a kingship in the Holy Land the Bible is as I've said before I think I talked about it this week in the Bible segment the Bible is really ambivalent about state power it is it is not big on the idea of theocracy per se but it's the idea that there ought to be a Jewish state based on foundational Jewish principles it's true for a few reasons among them anti-semitism and the and the tremendous outpouring of anti-semitism that is existed throughout history and also the idea that a country ruled by Jewish principles will be a good country just like a country ruled by Christian principles in the United States is a good country

when your kids are old enough to watch Star Wars will you show them in the order you sum them as a child or in the order of the saga good question Morgan so my wife was not super familiar with Star Wars so I have put her on a remedial Star Wars course and I started her with episode 4 I will never start any child on episode 1 why would i torture a child that way that's cruelty to animals and children don't do it yeah also the reason is because you have to actually care about Luke and Darth Vader and all these people before you go back and do Anakin all right that's it's foolish to start with with episode 1 I believe also because Star Wars Episode one I mean Phantom Menace is just garbage Phantom Menace is awful it's a real battle for worst movie ever between that and Attack of the Clones whoo both both stinkers Austin has a question Wow okay so where do I slap dog one I answered this a few days ago but Austin although he's a producer on the show obviously was not listening so right he was not so rogue one I slot at number three I like rogue one a lot so oh where do you watch it so okay so in order I would probably watch it now I would probably watch four five six three Road one eyebrow watch the road one afterward because it's the lead-in and then I'd probably go back and watch one two three and then Force awakens in the last Jedi so it's completely out of order but once you've watched the movies you can slide them all in and there's something that's fun and discoverable about it that way if you watch throw one and then you just watch the episode four you'd miss how cool rogue one is right because if you watch rogue one and then episode four then it just fits right in but the whole point is that they Reese lot it in a new movie which is super cool and then it transitions right into episode four which is really awesome okay Keenan's has been what is your favorite thing that Trump has done this year well it justice Gorsuch the moving of the embassy to Jerusalem the cuts and regulations the the tax bill getting rid of the individual man and he's done a lot of good things this year he's done a lot of good things this is this is a big gap for Trump is that so much of his policy is good and so much of his rhetoric is horrible that if he can get his rhetoric you know in a better direction then it won't be very hard to support him will it okay Eliot says hey Ben simple question for you should people on welfare be allowed to vote no representation without taxation so people on welfare should be allowed to vote and also there should be no law that's it that's basically my my take not because because I think that if you if you're a navab iding citizen in the United States then you should have the right to vote but I also think that the Constitution was designed to prevent welfare and I think that we are gonna have to make a move to convince people that they are not that they should not be dependent on government the barrier by the way between the presence of welfare and the non presence of welfare I do not think as people who are on welfare I don't think it really is as simple as everybody on welfare votes Democrat and everybody not on welfare votes Republican I think that we're gonna have to make a move toward convincing people that they ought not be on welfare in the first place that takes a moral shift in the culture and that's something that I mean that's what I do every day that's why I'm here because I think that's actually important Todd says do you have any insight as to how people from the same religious background can be raised with two conflicting political viewpoints not really which is why I think that you should marry somebody who has the same ideological viewpoint you do I says for example you have mentioned that being raised Jewish is why you are conservative alternatively one of the host of positive America stated that being raised in a Jewish family is the reason he's a Democrat okay that's because he wasn't raised in a Jewish family he's raised in an ethnically Jewish family where they like bagels and lox and think that everybody's anti-semitic and they visit shul once a year on Yom Kippur and break for lunch okay so I'm gonna I'm gonna challenge that contention that Jewishness makes you reform I mean the Jewishness makes you a liberal George Nixon makes you a leftist if by Jewishness you mean ethnic cultural identity and not religious identity because I guarantee you whichever hosts that is on polity of America their level of Jewish observance is probably lower than many Christians I know the Stefon says can you explain the difference between the Reagan tax cuts and the tax cuts that just passed so the Reagan tax cuts my understanding is that they were largely individually based they're all about lowering the individual tax rates the the top tax bracket was dropped from something like 70% to 28% it was radically eliminated all the tax brackets were moved down in pretty substantial ways in fact you know what I want to get this answer for you you know in a little bit more detail so I'm actually gonna look up the details of the Reagan tax cuts so the Reagan tax cuts were not basically corporate it spurred a lot of economic growth the top rate it was it was basically it was lowering the top tax bracket so the top rate fell from 70% to 50% and the and all of the other tax rates dropped similarly the 86 tax bill was also was also very different than this one the reason that people say this is serious tax reform is because it changes the corporate tax rate in a major way this person this particular tax rate again was was based in corporate taxation less than in an individual taxation in the I'm gonna wiki this ok so here's here's what wikipedia says doctor Wikipedia he says in the Act wasn't across-the-board decrease in the marginal income tax rates in the United States by 25 percent over 3 years with the top tax rate falling from 70 to 50 percent the bottom rate dropping from 14 percent to 11 percent it slashed estate taxes and trim taxes paid by Business Corporations by 150 billion over a five year period but most of the tax decreases were in the individual area it was less based on corporate taxation this one there were sort of minor cuts to the individual tax rates but there was major cuts to the corporate tax rates that's the major difference between the two sets of taxes okay crystal says hey Ben what would you say is the best evidence for god what gives you a reason to believe thanks for all you do my husband I listen to your show every day and discuss it together we're big fans so I'm writing a book on this the best evidence for God as I have said on the show before and as I say in debate with sam Harris which i think is going to he'll be putting that out pretty soon if he hasn't already the basic idea is that if you believe in free will if you believe in human reason if you believe in our capacity to understand the universe if you believe in a predictable universe with laws that govern it if you believe we do not live in a chaotic universe without meaning if you believe that you can derive aught from is then you need to believe in a divine creator okay and that's is not that's not an argument for the Bible but that's it that is an argument for God right that's that's the Aristotelian argument for God is that there is a rationale behind everything if you believe there's a rationale behind everything then you believe in God and if you believe as Aquinas did that that rationale is purely actual right here here's sort of the argument that Aristotle makes the error is the argument that Aristotle makes for the unmoved mover is not that everything has a cause and therefore there's God because then leftist and atheists just say well that's what what does God have a cause also right the idea is that there that everything that you see in front of you at one point was another thing that was actualized right there there's to that something has potential and there's the potential in the actual right like this piece of paper right here this has the potential to be ash but it requires fire in order to make it ash now fire itself also had a potential at one point right it was a match and it was a piece of wood or it was a rough surface so it had the potential to be fire but it was not fire so in order for something to become actual in order for potential to be actualized it has to be acted upon by something that is either fully actual or something that is a combination of the actual with its own potential the idea here would be that there is something that relies behind everything that is purely actual right it is actuality itself it is the most actual thing and this thing cannot be material because of the other material that it would have potential for change right it doesn't have potential for change therefore it is purely actual and that pure actuality also is all-knowing because anything that exists has to come from a place of it has to come from a place of a capacity for for being actualized and so it's the unnatural eyes to actualize err is the way that God would be put if you want to read a good book about proofs of God then Edward phasor is a book I've recommended on the show he has five proofs for the existence of God quite of the book and I recommend you check it out good Christmas rate actually I would recommend that you check that out again I think when it comes down to in the end is you either believe there's a purpose and meaning in human life or you don't if you don't you may end up in a theist if you do you're gonna end up at God no matter how you slice it and any attempts to avoid that which is the debate I had with Sam Harris any attempts to avoid that conclusion are bound to fall short Aaron says any tips on asking for a raise I love my workplace but my boss is pretty cheap my advice is that you actually make a list of your accomplishments and that you go in with another job offer in hand right that you actually go out and investigate the market well then you say look I love working here but I can make more money elsewhere are you gonna meet that or you gonna keep me don't make Bluffs I'm not I'm not big into Bluffs and I don't like bluffing even in poker I'm not good at bluffing I think that bluffing is a fool's errand so be ready to pull the trigger if you want to pull the trigger let's see jason says he mentioned it was a mistake to have an income tax what would you do instead if it were up to you other than huge spending cuts of course so I think there's a strong case for national sales tax that on transactions the government taxes basically because transactions can only take place in public square so certain extent that that seems to me a consumption tax seems to me more useful than an income tax because no business of the governments what kind of money I make but presumably if I'm acting in the public square then they may have more of an interest in the transactions in which I take play in which I take part although they should have not obviously restrict consensual transactions Jimmy says Ben what is your opinion on privatized versus publicly run prisons the only reason for publicly run prisons how it assumes that you don't want to set up a corrupt system whereby privatized prisons are attempting to create more criminals but yeah I don't really have a problem with privatized prisons particularly if you hold them liable for mistreatment of prisoners right if they actually signed contracts with the state let's say that we can sue you if you mistreat the prisoners if you harm the prisoners that actually creates more accountability not less public systems have very little accountability Elvises what's your take on the high prices of legal services it seems like most cases result in settlements simply to avoid the high cost of legal process money shouldn't impact justice right though the reason that you have high prices on legal services is because everybody goes to court for every reason so what you should do instead is we should set up a system like Britain's where if you sue and you lose you pay the bills if you do that that's going to prevent people from going to court with frivolous cases Stephen says had it been celebrate New Year's one glass of wine or one bottle I celebrate New Year's by deciding who to destroy in the coming year that's how I celebrate New Year's I and I mean honestly it's a strain from even to stay up till midnight on New Year's the Jewish New Year was already in Rosh Hashanah and we made not just New Year's resolutions but commitments to God so New Year is like getting going to party and getting drunk with people I'm not big on getting drunk with anybody in NASA I'm really not a big drinker is the truth like yesterday everyone at the Christmas party got some form of alcoholic gift which is why productivity at the company is so low but I am I'm not a big drinker for some reason a lot of alcohol really gives me heartburn which is weird wine particularly but I the the III drink like a girl I mean all of the drinks that I like our girls rings I like I like things that taste good I don't understand why guys have this macho thing about drinking turpentine they sit around and they sit around smoking on leaves and drinking turpentine and it's like why would you do that there's a thing called sugar try it it's great okay moshe says hi Ben I'm a medium I'm from a medium-to-large modern orthodox community New York recently there's been some controversy when a local synagogue wouldn't allow a married lesbian couple to join the membership even though they were separate members when they were single if sin started their own show which promotes acceptance of all it's caused a bit of controversy in the neighborhood where some are saying a religious institution should adhere to a religious standard others are pointing out there are plenty of people who sin why should this seam be held to a different standard regarding membership in the show I was wondering what your take is on Modern Orthodox Scholz taking on same-sex couples as members so my answer is that they cannot join us a couple right that's the answer is that from a religious standard they cannot join us a couple they do not get the same rights as married couples they should not be treated as a married couple because that's the religious standard now I don't think the government has anything to do here but the religious standard in Judaism is that homosexuality is a sin not homosexual orientation but homosexual activity you wouldn't allow somebody to join your Orthodox shul who came in every day right who came into the shul on Saturdays with their cellphone blaring and saying I'm a non Sabbath observant Jew and I'm here to Domon and doing it openly there's one thing that they come in with the cell phone in the pocket and it goes off and it reads a little bit awkward but the whole point here is that glorification of sin in an Orthodox context is not a cool thing so I think that's right that they're allowed to be members when they're single now that they're married if they want to join as single members that's fine but I don't think that's what they want what they really want is for the entire community to change its standard of marriage to meet them and that seems to me an imposition on the community okay so we have more questions but we'll have to save those for for next year we'll have to save those for next year now a quick thing I like and then a thing I hate and then I have a quick message of things actually I'm capable of saying it yes indeed okay so things I like so we're gonna finish the year on a high note with some John way and so if you've never seen this movie it's actually one of my favorite John Wayne movies it was not a huge hit but it is really enjoyable the movie is called Big Jake and starts old John Wayne and and Maureen O'Hara who remained gorgeous her entire life and the basic premise it's basically taken about a Western that's really what it is it's it's these these guys who come and kidnap a child and John Wayne is the grandfather and John Wayne goes after them and he brings along a couple of his sons right who are the uncles of the kid and in them in the movie one of his sons is actually by Patrick Wayne John Wayne's real son then the movie takes place in supposedly 1908 so you see there there's a couple of cars but he's riding horses and so there's also this sort of Western versus modern conflict that's going on where John Wayne represents sort of the Old West and you need the Old West to come into the modern world and save people when the bad guys show up it's a really enjoyable flick here's a little bit of the preview I just saw something in your eyes I don't like I saw a foolish thought you understand me anything happens anything at all your fault my fault nobody's fault my little brother will blow that kid's head right off it's as simple as that no matter who else gets killed that boy dies shotgun misses him at the Manor you already know about the rifle on him that won't be as messy as a shotgun at three feet but that boy will be just as dead you understand me say it I understand now open it up all right so we'll cut it off there because this seam gets pretty intense the other son is played by Christopher Mitchum who is Robert Mitchum son so that's kind of fun and it's worth watching the best performance in it is Richard Boone who plays the villain here and the movie is is really good it's pretty bloody it basically it didn't occur to me until I was looking at this yes yet you know until I was looking at this yesterday that this is taken the movie is taken but it's in old Western with John Wayne and it it lives up to the hype okay time for a quick thing I hate one thing I hate and then I have a message so the thing I hate today is something that you will like and that is we made a Christmas message from the daily wire to you I have to acknowledge that this was my idea so I can't hate it completely but now that it has materialized in real life form its I sort of hate it so here it is here is a here's our Christmas video from The Daily wire to you thank you so much right now and I just want to say a couple of quick messages really for Christmas in the in the new year it's a great time of the season to spend time with friends and family and let's remember something we spend a lot of time on the show a lot of time on the show talking about politics and the daily battles they're in and one of the things I've been thinking about over the last couple of years and I'm writing a book about it now is we're so angry at each other all the time Americans are so angry at each other over politics over tax cuts and Obamacare and foreign policy and the reality is we must have a common vision a common purpose we must feel like we're part of the same team and one of the ways to do that is to recognize that we are all seeking human happiness in a in a communal purpose based on virtue so this Christmas don't just spend time enjoying with family think about how to be a more virtuous human being next year think about how to be a better person not just in terms of interpersonal connections but how you can be better in terms of thinking about your obligations to your family to the world in pilot how can you make yourself better how can you make yourself more successful if we all think about those things we think about our individual purpose how we can succeed in our own lives we think that our communal purpose what brings us together around common shared principles then we'll finally have a country worthy of preserving again and a country where you know we can we can act on that founding vision that brought us all together in the first place and then I think has been fragmenting in the past couple of years we are all brothers and sisters whether we recognize it or not and in the end we're part of the same family but that family has to have a common purpose not just a common heritage so let's let's think about where to go from here I also want to thank everybody who works on the show over here at the Daily wire I want to thank all of my producers I'm not gonna name all of them because I'm sure they don't forget somebody and be yelled at later so just check out the credits at the end of the show but everybody who works really hard day to day on the show they do they work extremely hard to cut the clips play the clips at the right time make sure the clip is not available for playing Marshall they really work hard to to make sure that the show is as good as it is every day and they deserve my thanks and so really from the bottom my heart it's great to be part of the team with you we couldn't do it without you and finally thank you to our audience this has been an unbelievable year for The Daily wire it's been an incredible year for the Daily wire when we literally went from a site that did not exist two years ago to a site with 100 million page views a month when went from a podcast that did not exist two years ago to a podcast that is downloaded well in excess of half a million times a day and that is viewed another half a million times on Facebook very often so we have a million people engaging with the show on a daily basis that's thanks to you thanks for being part of what we're trying to do here and thanks for giving us a rational hearing and if you're on the other side particularly thanks to you freshly spending some time out of your comfort zone and listening to some folks on the other side because I think that it makes the country better if we all do that I'll see you next year it's been it's been a wonderful year thanks once again and have a very Merry Christmas and a wonderful new year i'm ben
