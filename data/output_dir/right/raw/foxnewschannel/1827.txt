A PRIVATE INVESTIGATION

DISAPPEARED IN IRAN MORE THAN

00:00:30,999 --> 00:00:31,433
10 YEARS AGO.

YOUR FATHER WAS FORGOTTEN.

25
00:00:36,672 --> 00:00:37,506
AND PERHAPS FOR LACK OF A

26
00:00:37,506 --> 00:00:39,074
BETTER TERM, FIGHTING FOR HIM

27
00:00:39,074 --> 00:00:46,348
WAS SACRIFICED FOR THE YEAR

28
00:00:46,348 --> 00:00:46,381
WAS SACRIFICED FOR THE DEAR

29
00:00:46,381 --> 00:00:47,316
WAS SACRIFICED FOR THE DEAL THE

30
00:00:47,316 --> 00:00:48,083
OBAMA ADMINISTRATION WANTED TO

31
00:00:48,083 --> 00:00:48,350
GO.

32
00:00:48,350 --> 00:00:49,618
HAVE THINGS CHANGED UNDER THE

33
00:00:49,618 --> 00:00:50,319
TRUMP ADMINISTRATION?

34
00:00:50,319 --> 00:00:51,086
>> THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME

35
00:00:51,086 --> 00:00:51,587
TODAY.

36
00:00:51,587 --> 00:00:55,390
MY FATHER HAS BEEN REPEATEDLY

37
00:00:55,390 --> 00:00:57,192
LEFT BEHIND BY PREVIOUS

38
00:00:57,192 --> 00:00:57,659
ADMINISTRATIONS.

39
00:00:57,659 --> 00:01:02,731
AND IT HAS HAPPENED OVER AND

40
00:01:02,731 --> 00:01:03,465
OVER AGAIN BUT WE FEEL

41
00:01:03,465 --> 00:01:04,800
PRESIDENT TRUMP AS THE

42
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:05,734
NEGOTIATION SKILLS TO BRING OUR

43
00:01:05,734 --> 00:01:07,803
FATHER HOME.

44
00:01:07,803 --> 00:01:10,205
AND SECRETARY POMPEO HAS JUST

45
00:01:10,205 --> 00:01:15,811
SHOWN THAT BRINGING AMERICANS

46
00:01:15,811 --> 00:01:16,678
HAVE BEEN HELD CAPTIVE ABROAD

47
00:01:16,678 --> 00:01:17,579
IS AN IMPORTANT ISSUE TO HIM SO

48
00:01:17,579 --> 00:01:18,280
WE ARE VERY HOPEFUL.

49
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:22,017
>>LELAND: YOUR FATHER'S CASE IS

50
00:01:22,017 --> 00:01:31,059
INTERESTING BECAUSE HE WAS

51
00:01:31,059 --> 00:01:32,127
ABROAD ON AN INVESTIGATOR BUT

52
00:01:32,127 --> 00:01:33,328
NOT FOR THE U.S. GOVERNMENT.

53
00:01:33,328 --> 00:01:34,163
THE IRANIANS WON'T EVEN SAY

54
00:01:34,163 --> 00:01:34,630
THEY HAVE THEM.

55
00:01:34,630 --> 00:01:35,664
A LOT OF QUESTIONS ABOUT WHERE

56
00:01:35,664 --> 00:01:36,532
HE WAS AND HOW AND WHY HE WAS

57
00:01:36,532 --> 00:01:41,170
TAKEN ON THAT ISLAND OFF THE

58
00:01:41,170 --> 00:01:41,804
COAST OF IRAN.

59
00:01:41,804 --> 00:01:42,638
GIVE US A SENSE OF HOW MUCH

60
00:01:42,638 --> 00:01:43,572
INFORMATION YOU HAVE TWO PIN

61
00:01:43,572 --> 00:01:44,206
THIS ON THE IRANIANS.

62
00:01:44,206 --> 00:01:50,379
>> MY FAMILY RECENTLY MET WITH

63
00:01:50,379 --> 00:01:51,113
- - OUR IRANIAN LAWYER.

64
00:01:51,113 --> 00:01:51,880
HE INFORMED US THAT HE DID FILE

65
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:54,850
MY FATHER'S CASE AS A MISSING

66
00:01:54,850 --> 00:02:04,960
PERSON'S CASE IN IRAN

67
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:05,260
PERSON'S CASE IN IRAN, THE

68
00:02:05,260 --> 00:02:06,161
CLASSIFICATION WAS CHANGED TO A

69
00:02:06,161 --> 00:02:06,762
SECURITY CASE.

70
00:02:06,762 --> 00:02:07,629
THE CASE HAS JUST INSTALLED AT

71
00:02:07,629 --> 00:02:08,497
THAT POINT THAT WAS MANY YEARS

72
00:02:08,497 --> 00:02:09,798
AGO.WE DON'T SEE ANY URGENCY

73
00:02:09,798 --> 00:02:12,801
BY IRAN TO RESOLVE MY FATHER'S

74
00:02:12,801 --> 00:02:14,803
CASE.

75
00:02:14,803 --> 00:02:22,444
MY FATHER'S PASSPORT HAS NOT

76
00:02:22,444 --> 00:02:23,579
BEEN SEEN IN ANY OTHER COUNTRY.

77
00:02:23,579 --> 00:02:24,546
IRAN HAS A MORAL OBLIGATION TO

78
00:02:24,546 --> 00:02:25,414
PROVIDE US INFORMATION ABOUT

79
00:02:25,414 --> 00:02:26,215
OUR FATHER AND TO BRING HIM

80
00:02:26,215 --> 00:02:26,815
HOME TO US.

81
00:02:26,815 --> 00:02:27,850
>>LELAND: WHAT INFORMATION DO

82
00:02:27,850 --> 00:02:29,618
YOU HAVE ABOUT WHAT THE

83
00:02:29,618 --> 00:02:32,921
ADMINISTRATION IS DOING NOW?

84
00:02:32,921 --> 00:02:33,655
HAVE YOU GOTTEN ANYTHING FROM

85
00:02:33,655 --> 00:02:34,289
THEM TO SAY THERE'S BEEN

86
00:02:34,289 --> 00:02:34,890
MOVEMENT ON THIS BY THE

87
00:02:34,890 --> 00:02:35,257
IRANIANS?

88
00:02:35,257 --> 00:02:38,193
>> WE SPEAK WITH GOVERNMENT

89
00:02:38,193 --> 00:02:39,061
OFFICIALS ON REGULAR BASIS.

90
00:02:39,061 --> 00:02:44,967
BUT WE HAVE NOT HEARD ANYTHING

91
00:02:44,967 --> 00:02:46,268
ON MOVEMENT, UNFORTUNATELY.WE

92
00:02:46,268 --> 00:02:46,835
HAVE TO GO THROUGH A

93
00:02:46,835 --> 00:02:49,037
THIRD-PARTY BECAUSE WE DON'T

94
00:02:49,037 --> 00:02:49,972
HAVE THE RELATIONS WITH IRAN.

95
00:02:49,972 --> 00:02:50,839
BUT WHAT WE DO KNOW IS THAT IF

96
00:02:50,839 --> 00:02:52,975
THE SUPREME LEADER SAYS SEND

97
00:02:52,975 --> 00:03:00,983
BOB LEVINSON HOME, HE CAN BE

98
00:03:00,983 --> 00:03:01,650
HOME WAS TOMORROW.

99
00:03:01,650 --> 00:03:02,784
IT'S BEEN 11 YEARS TO LEARN.

100
00:03:02,784 --> 00:03:05,420
HE'S BEEN HELD FOR 4083 DAYS.

101
00:03:05,420 --> 00:03:06,722
I DON'T UNDERSTAND AND MY

102
00:03:06,722 --> 00:03:07,456
FAMILY DOESN'T UNDERSTAND HOW

103
00:03:07,456 --> 00:03:09,558
THIS IS ALLOWED IN MODERN TIMES

104
00:03:09,558 --> 00:03:10,459
THAT A MAN CAN BE HELD WITH NO

105
00:03:10,459 --> 00:03:11,059
HUMAN RIGHTS.

106
00:03:11,059 --> 00:03:21,904
>>LELAND: WE HAVEN'T HEARD MUCH

107
00:03:21,904 --> 00:03:22,771
FROM THE PRESIDENT ABOUT YOUR

108
00:03:22,771 --> 00:03:23,605
FATHER'S CASE OR THE OTHER

109
00:03:23,605 --> 00:03:24,273
AMERICANS HELD IN IRAN.

110
00:03:24,273 --> 00:03:25,741
THE ADMINISTRATION FOCUSED ON

111
00:03:25,741 --> 00:03:26,508
THOSE HELD IN WITH KOREA.

112
00:03:26,508 --> 00:03:27,442
HAVEN'T HEARD MUCH ABOUT THOSE

113
00:03:27,442 --> 00:03:28,043
HELD IN IRAN.

114
00:03:28,043 --> 00:03:28,744
WHY DO THINK THAT IS?

115
00:03:28,744 --> 00:03:32,414
>> I CAN'T SPECULATE.

116
00:03:32,414 --> 00:03:34,283
ALL I AM IS A DAUGHTER WHO

117
00:03:34,283 --> 00:03:39,588
WANTS HER FATHER HOME.

118
00:03:39,588 --> 00:03:40,622
HE HAS MANY GRANDCHILDREN THAT

119
00:03:40,622 --> 00:03:41,890
HAVE BEEN BORN SINCE HE'S BEEN

120
00:03:41,890 --> 00:03:46,295
IN CAPTIVITY.

121
00:03:46,295 --> 00:03:47,562
MY PARENTS 44TH WEDDING

122
00:03:47,562 --> 00:03:48,263
ANNIVERSARY WAS YESTERDAY AND

123
00:03:48,263 --> 00:03:49,298
11 OF THOSE YEARS HAVE BEEN

124
00:03:49,298 --> 00:03:50,032
SPENT IN CAPTIVITY.

125
00:03:50,032 --> 00:03:54,770
IT'S JUST UNCONSCIONABLE TO

126
00:03:54,770 --> 00:03:55,570
THINK THAT THIS IS ALLOWED.

127
00:03:55,570 --> 00:03:56,505
WE'RE JUST A FEELING THAT ONCE

128
00:03:56,505 --> 00:03:57,139
OUR FATHER HOME.

129
00:03:57,139 --> 00:04:00,909
>>LELAND: THE EMOTION IS

130
00:04:00,909 --> 00:04:01,376
UNDERSTANDABLE.

131
00:04:01,376 --> 00:04:02,411
YOUR WORK ON BEHALF OF YOUR

132
00:04:02,411 --> 00:04:03,145
FATHER AND YOUR TIRELESS

133
00:04:03,145 --> 00:04:04,012
WILLINGNESS TO COME AND TALK

134
00:04:04,012 --> 00:04:11,954
ABOUT HIM I THINK SAYS A LOT

135
00:04:11,954 --> 00:04:13,121
ABOUT THE FAMILY YOU ALL HAVE.

136
00:04:13,121 --> 00:04:13,889
LAST QUESTION FOR YOU.

137
00:04:13,889 --> 00:04:14,790
AS THE ADMINISTRATION ANNOUNCED

138
00:04:14,790 --> 00:04:15,757
THEY WERE GOING TO PULL OUT OF

139
00:04:15,757 --> 00:04:20,428
THE IRAN NUCLEAR DEAL, WAS

140
00:04:20,428 --> 00:04:21,630
THERE A PIT IN THE BOTTOM OF

141
00:04:21,630 --> 00:04:22,331
YOUR STOMACH THAT SAID THIS

142
00:04:22,331 --> 00:04:23,031
WILL MAKE IT HARDER TO BRING

143
00:04:23,031 --> 00:04:24,066
THAT HOME OR DO YOU FEEL LIKE

144
00:04:24,066 --> 00:04:25,033
THIS COULD BRING MOVEMENT TO

145
00:04:25,033 --> 00:04:27,436
THE CASE?

146
00:04:27,436 --> 00:04:28,503
>> TO BE HONEST, THERE'S A PIT

147
00:04:28,503 --> 00:04:29,304
IN MY STOMACH EVERY DAY ALONG

148
00:04:29,304 --> 00:04:30,639
WITH MY BROTHERS AND SISTERS.

149
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:31,506
EVERY DAY HE'S NOT HOME WITH

150
00:04:31,506 --> 00:04:33,842
US, IT'S DEVASTATING.

151
00:04:33,842 --> 00:04:34,710
WE'D LIKE TO THINK WE ARE

152
00:04:34,710 --> 00:04:35,043
HOPEFUL.

153
00:04:35,043 --> 00:04:40,749
SECRETARY POMPEO JUST SHOWED

154
00:04:40,749 --> 00:04:41,650
HE'S BEEN IN OFFICE FOR JUST A

155
00:04:41,650 --> 00:04:42,484
SHORT AMOUNT OF TIME IN THAT

156
00:04:42,484 --> 00:04:43,585
POSITION.

157
00:04:43,585 --> 00:04:44,252
AND HE HAS MADE AMERICANS

158
00:04:44,252 --> 00:04:48,623
ABROAD WHO'VE BEEN HELD IN

159
00:04:48,623 --> 00:04:49,558
CAPTIVITY, A PRIORITY.

160
00:04:49,558 --> 00:04:50,659
WE ARE HOPEFUL.

161
00:04:50,659 --> 00:04:55,664
I APPRECIATE THE SENTIMENT.

162
00:04:55,664 --> 00:04:56,431
WE WILL NEVER GIVE UP.

163
00:04:56,431 --> 00:04:57,265
OUR FATHER HAS AND WE ARE

164
00:04:57,265 --> 00:04:58,100
FIGHTING EVERYTHING TODAY FOR

165
00:04:58,100 --> 00:04:58,667
HIM.

166
00:04:58,667 --> 00:04:59,601
AND WE HOPE ON THE OTHER END

167
00:04:59,601 --> 00:05:01,636
THAT HE IS FIGHTING EVERY

168
00:05:01,636 --> 00:05:02,604
SINGLE DAY TO GET HOME TO US.

169
00:05:02,604 --> 00:05:11,680
>>LELAND: SUFFICE TO SAY

170
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:11,947
>>LELAND: SUFFICE TO SAY, A

171
00:05:11,947 --> 00:05:12,848
FATHER'S LOVE KNOWS NO ENDS AND

172
00:05:12,848 --> 00:00:00,000
I'M SURE HE KNOWS THE FEELING
