well on this day in Congress we saw things that we've never seen before in the Senate we saw a 51:48 vote to confirm an assistant attorney general to head the criminal division of the Justice Department which supervises all of the federal prosecutors in the country and votes to confirm assistant attorneys general to that post are usually not close they are usually overwhelmingly bipartisan because the nominee is usually a recognized professional with significant experience as a federal prosecutor but this was the first time we saw the Senate confirmed someone to that job who has never been a federal prosecutor or a local prosecutor and in fact has never appeared as a lawyer in federal court has never tried a case in federal court that was a uniquely trumpian appointment the likes of which we have not seen before and in the House of Representatives today we saw something with elements of something that we have seen before something disturbing former Republican Speaker of the House Dennis Hastert got in trouble late in his career because of his days as a high school wrestling coach he was caught paying hundreds of thousands of dollars to buy the silence of a man who said he was sexually abused by Dennis Hastert in those days when he was a coach and today another wrestling coach is in trouble in the House of Representatives Congressman Jim Jordan is trying to convince the House of Representatives and his constituents in Ohio that the wrestlers that he used to coach are now lying about him eight former wrestlers from cars Ben Jordans days as a wrestling coach at Ohio State University say that they complained directly to him about sexually aggressive behavior and in some cases molestation by the wrestling teams dr. Richard Strauss Republican House members and remember what happened to Dennis Hastert have to be worried tonight about what the future might hold for Republican Congressman Jim Jordan but also today in Congress there were glimmers of sanity and these days glimmers are about the most we're going to get glimmers in both the House and the and it is the second day in a row that we have seen a demonstration of sanity in the United States Senate yesterday's 97 to 2 Senate vote to essentially rebuke president Trump's rhetoric about NATO was led by the senior Democrat in the Armed Services Committee Jack Reed who will be our first guest here tonight today another vote to rebuke the president's policy this time on tariffs was led in the United States Senate by Republicans and it was supported by all Democrats in an 88 to 11 vote against the president's policies on tariffs now the House of Representatives tends to work in stranger and often more invisible ways than the relatively open proceedings that you can watch on the Senate floor and so there isn't much to show you in the way that the house rebuked the president today for his reckless and fault false language about NATO last night at this hour we showed you Jack Reid's speech on the Senate floor specifically attacking what President Trump has said about Vladimir Putin and arguing in favor of what was senator Reid's resolution to quote reaffirm the commitment of the United States to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization Alliance as a community of freedom peace security and shared values including Liberty human rights democracy in the rule of law senator Reid's resolution got only two opposing votes from Republicans Rand Paul and Mike Lee who sometimes call themselves libertarians a similar resolution in the House of Representatives today was actually passed unanimously not one vote cast in support of the president's rhetoric and the house representatives today and like the resolution in the Senate yesterday the house resolution was sponsored by a member of the seemingly powerless Democratic minority Congressman Steve Cohen of Tennessee but you would never know that even if you are watching the House floor very closely today because as I said as you'll see in a moment the house acts in mysterious ways Steve Cohen's resolution expresses quote support for the countries of Eastern Europe and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization the resolution says the the House of Representatives one condemns any threat to the sovereignty territorial integrity freedom and democracy over the Baltic States to condemns the clear gross and uncorrupted ongoing violation of the Helsinki principles by the Russian Federation with respect to the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine three supports keeping United States sanctions imposed against Russia relating to Crimea in effect until Ukraine's sovereignty over Crimea has been restored but you need to hear any of that in the House of Representatives today because the Republican floor manager of what was going on in the House today edy Bruce the chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee introduced the resolution as a unanimous Foreign Affairs Committee voted resolution this way for what purpose does the gentleman from California seek recognition consent that the Committee on Foreign Affairs be discharged from further consideration of House Resolution 256 and asked for its immediate consideration in the house the clerk will report the title of the resolution House Resolution 256 resolution expressing support for the countries of Eastern Europe and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization is there objection to the consideration of the resolution and there was no objection and I told you there wasn't going to be much to see here and because there was no objection that means that that resolution passed the House of Representatives unanimously and that happened after the president engaged in a public argument about NATO in which in his desperate attempt to win the argument he did what he always does when he's desperate he lied Germany as far as I'm concerned is captive to Russia because it's getting so much energy from Russia as the New York Times correctly pointed out immediately after that President Trump is wrong the Germans now get only about 9% of their energy from Russia not the 70% that mr. Trump claimed and joining us now is Democratic Senator Jack Reed of Rhode Island he is the ranking member of the Senate Armed Services Committee and Senator Reid I wanted to ask you about how how easy how and how hard was it for you to achieve what you did yesterday on the Senate floor getting ninety seven votes in the Senate floor in what was essentially a rebuke of President Trump's rhetoric about NATO well we have the opportunity on the Senate floor to speak and we were able to do that senator Menendez senator Durbin senator Murphy Senator Schumer and I I think it was the arguments but more than that beyond a rebuke it was an affirmation of our support for NATO a recognition of its role in defending the United States over many many decades also a recognition of the rule of law as a guiding principle in international relationships and finally asking the President to do what we asked last year in the defense bill give us a report on the malign activities of Russia that's going on today and what we got was a response and bipartisan response but it really wasn't about party was about this country about representing our constituents at about standing up for what we stood up for decades so it was a very satisfying and I think it started a chain reaction as you pointed out today where the house felt they had to also do something like that and hopefully it'll be a good counterpoint to what the president is doing in NATO and we can move forward grow and retreat I saw that Senator McConnell actually voted on your side yesterday but I wondered did he put up any kind of roadblocks for you ahead of time on trying to do this I know we've had a very very cooperative debate and process with the defense bill that's tradition and a part of it as I think goes back to Senator John McCain his inspiration even today he's inspiring us with his his conduct and and even before John with John Warner and Carl Levin and many many people but this has been a very bipartisan process and so when we indicated that we bring the resolution to the floor the instruction the conferees there was no opposition in fact senator Inhofe my counterpart the chairman or acting chairman was supportive so again I think you saw yesterday people not talking about party but talking about principle and making sure that the world understands we support NATO we affirm our support for NATO and Senator Reid your reaction to the way you saw the president representing the United States today at the NATO summit I think it's not helpful at all in fact I think it is ironically on perhaps merely coincidentally doing what Vladimir Putin's been doing for many years now which is trying to undermine NATO try to disparage NATO trying to disparage one of its principal members Germany also trying and make Putin has been to lower the prestige and the the moral influence of the United States in Europe and around the world so this is not helpful particularly as he approaches his meeting with President Putin I think a unified NATO one that is committed to the shared values of freedom of opportunity for its citizens and a peaceful world it was much more effective than disparaging a country one member or all the numerous NATO I was looking at comments by former secretary for massacre State Madeleine Albright today talking about the things Donald Trump was saying about NATO two years ago and condemning that language two years ago as this continues and as the rhetoric seems to increase do you or other senators fear that the president might be trying to get the United States to actually leave NATO well that would be a catastrophic situation NATO has been our front line of defense we're there for our protection this is not something gratuitous activity on behalf of the Europeans that they're the front lines say I would rather frankly be conferring Russia with forces there then not be there and have Russia influencing Europe that would be detrimental not only determine as I said catastrophic so I again I think that this whole these proposals to withdraw troops etc it not only would hurt us but it just ignores the the commitment and the contribution that NATO is making for the first time the article 5 was invoked when we were attacked on 9/11 that was the European community coming to our assistance European forces NATO forces have been with us in Afghanistan they've lost personnel there they've died along with our soldiers there and sailors the marines and airmen they are with us in iraq helping to train Iraqi forces they are in the Baltic countries as a tripwire to prevent another Crimea happening in the Baltic we're a hybrid operation by the Russians takes out one of our NATO members this is a real commitment and there are increased spending after 2014 particularly is significant about 87 billion dollars so disparaging NATO is I think a mistake leading it would be a catastrophe hundred quickly before you go did you hear any grumblings in the cloakroom or any anything from Republicans that wouldn't have been on their microphones about being afraid of voting as they did yesterday in the Senate in what was essentially a rebuke of the president's rhetoric not at all no again I think they approached it as senators as a as representatives of their constituents as what was the right thing to do rather than what was the most convenient thing to do and that I think accounts for the ninety seven to two vote and in fact I think both senator poems and only have a consistent record of not being supportive of international organizations so I think they felt to in principle they were taking the vote that they should take Senator Reid thank you very much really appreciate it thanks for checking out our YouTube channel
