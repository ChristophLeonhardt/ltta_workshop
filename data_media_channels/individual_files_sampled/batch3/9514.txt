DECISION THAT WOULD HINGE ON A NEW JUSTICE KAVANAUGH. THEY UNDERSTAND THAT THE FUND-RAISING IS FIERCE RIGHT NO NOW. IT IS FIERCE. WE HAVE SEEN A 500% INCREASE IN OUR FUND-RAISING AT THE END OF THIS MONTH HAS TENSIONS HAVE BEEN BOILING OVER IN WASHINGTON AND VOTERS HAVE STARTED TO PAY ATTENTION, REPUBLICANS ARE SAYING WE WANT TO SEE RESULTS IN WASHINGTON. WE DON'T WANT THIS DYSFUNCTION AND IS CHAOS IN THE RESIST AND THEY OBSTRUCT THAT THE DEMOCRATS ARE PUTTING FORWARD. WE LIKE WHAT REPUBLICANS ARE GETTING DONE, 3.7% UNEMPLOYMENT ALONE SINCE WE PUT A MAN ON THE MOON. Harris: I DON'T KNOW IF YOU HAVE SEEN THIS POLLING BUT I WANT TO SHARE WITH HER VIEWERS, THE POLITICS OF SUPPORTING A SUPREME COURT NOMINEE ARE PLAYING OUT AMONG INDEPENDENT VOTERS. DEMOCRATS HANDLING OF THE KAVANAUGH NOMINATION, THIS IS HOW THEY SEE IT. 58% DISAPPROVE OF THE WAY THE DEMOCRATS HANDLED THAT NOMINATION. WHAT IS YOUR TAKE AWAY FROM THAT? I'M NOT SURPRISED. LOOK AT DIANNE FEINSTEIN WHO RECEIVED THE DOCTOR FOR LETTER AND HELD IT IN HER BACK POCKET, DIDN'T TAKE IT TO A COLLEAGUE CHAIRMAN GRASSLEY AND SAID LET'S CONDUCT A PRIVATE INVESTIGATION. USING IS VERY IMPORTANT STORIES TO NOT BRING THESE ALLEGATIONS FORWARD TO THEIR COLLEAGUES. IT HAS BEEN SHAMEFUL AND THEN THE CONTINUING OF DISRUPTION DURING THE HEARINGS. AS IS AND WHAT WANT FOR OUR COUNTRY. WE SHOULD BE ABLE TO HAVE A CIVILIZED DISCUSSION WITHOUT WRITING OR ATTACKING THE OTHER PARTY AND IS NOT WHAT THEY HAVE DONE DURING THIS PROCESS. Harris: THE MIDTERM ELECTION 28 DAYS AWAY FROM TODAY. HOW DOES THE KAVANAUGH CONFIRMATION FIT INTO THE REPUBLICAN SIDE FOR THE REPUBLICAN NARRATIVE TO VOTERS RIGHT NOW? IN THAT FIRST MIDTERM OF A SITTING PRESIDENT, THE PARTY IN POWER USUALLY LOSES ON AVERAGE 30 SEATS. BARACK OBAMA LOST 63 BECAUSE THE PARTY BECOMES COMPLACENT. THEY THINK WE WON BACK THE WHITE HOUSE, WE DON'T NEED TO GET OUT AND ABOUT. THESE HEARINGS HAVE WOKEN UP OUR VOTERS. THEY NOW RECOGNIZE WHAT'S AT STAKE. THEY ARE SEEING TWO VERY CLEAR CHOICES. REPUBLICANS WHO ARE DELIVERING RESULTS FOR THE AMERICAN PEOPLE, JOBS, HIGHER WAGES, AN ECONOMY THAT IS BOOMING. AND DEMOCRATS WHO ARE RUNNING ON RESIST, OBSTRUCT, THE SPRING MORE DYSFUNCTION TO WASHINGTON, MORE INVESTIGATIONS, IT'S VERY CLEAR AND REPUBLICANS AND INDEPENDENTS ARE SAYING WE DON'T LIKE WHAT THE DEMOCRATS ARE OFFERING RIGHT NOW AND THEY'RE GETTING MORE ENERGIZED AND I THINK THAT'S GOOD NEWS FOR US GOING INTO THESE MIDTERMS. Harris: I WANT TO STEP AWAY NOW TO THE EXIT BY AMBASSADOR NIKKI HALEY. AND I KNOW THE INDEPENDENT'S IN OTHERS ARE SAYING IT. THE DEMOCRATS HAD BETTER WATCH OUT BECAUSE THIS IS ANOTHER POINT THAT THEY MAY MISS READ IN TERMS OF HER DEPARTURE. HOW DO YOU SEE A? AMBASSADOR HALEY IS A CHAMPION AND FOR WOMEN ACROSS THE COUNTRY, FOR YOUNG GIRLS AND IT DOES SHOW THE STRONG WOMEN THAT PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS BROUGHT INTO HIS ADMINISTRATION AND AS U.N. AMBASSADOR, SHE HAS RESTORED THE UNITED STATES AS A GLOBAL LEADER, SHE HAS TAKEN ON IRAN AND SYRIA AND RUSSIA AND NORTH KOREA. SHE HAS BEEN DECISIVE, SHE'S BEEN TOUGH. SHE HAS NOT APOLOGIZE FOR PUTTING AMERICA FIRST SO IT'S A LOSS. BUT I KNOW THE PRESIDENT WILL BE PUTTING SOMEBODY GREAT IN HER PLACE AND I'M SURE SHE IS GOING TO BE STICKING AROUND TO HELP THAT PERSON ANYTIME THEY NEED T TO. Harris: JOHN ROBERTS REPORTING ABOUT MENENDEZ NOT EVEN MENTIONING THAT PLACE OF A WOMAN AT THE TOP. AND THEN BRAD SHERMAN ON MY SHOW, THE CONGRESSMAN EARLIER DIDN'T MAKE THAT POINT TO THE PARTY OF WOMEN LAST WORD FROM YOU. WE ARE A PARTY OF WOMEN. I DON'T KNOW IF PEOPLE NOTICE, I'M THE HEAD OF THE RNC, A WOMAN RUNNING THE REPUBLICAN PARTY, I AM A SUBURBAN COLLEGE EDUCATED WOMAN. I REALLY DON'T LIKE THE NARRATIVE THAT ALL WOMEN ABOUT THE SAME. I'M SURE YOU DON'T. AND WHEN I LOOK AT WHAT THIS ADMINISTRATION HAS DONE, IT HAS MADE MY FAMILIES LIFE BETTER, FAMILIES LIVES BETTER ACROSS THIS COUNTRY. WHEN WE HAVE ECONOMIC PROSPERITY, IT LIFTS THAT'S WHAT WE ARE GOING TO BE TAKEN TO THE
