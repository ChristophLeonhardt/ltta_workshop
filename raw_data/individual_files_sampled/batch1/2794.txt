fast-food is not just for adults every big fast-food chain also has its own kids menu where it's usually something a little bit smaller and a little bit cheaper usually comes with a toy sometimes when you're in a pinch you just want to get something quick for your kids and sometimes if you're like me you have an unpaid internship and no money so I went ahead and got a kid's meal from the top fast-food chains in the country a for effort it even comes in a little box here here we go little guy french fries mini apple juice box and gogurts dude this has 19 grams of sugar in it that seems like a lot doesn't it it's hard to drink hmm I don't think of her head go good before my dummy is this is yo play yogurt and like a tube to get that price point up on the screen ah Donald's emoji plush toy apple slices cheeseburger chocolate milk again just ketchup and cheese that's kind of the thing about kids right so they just want the meat and cheese and the bread that's what I wanted when I was a kid it's what I want now kids are so lucky they're not they eat vegetables mmm they're toys they want to pay rent the food's cheaper not gonna review the apples nother review God's work dude I get that a shuck of milk but it's like brother Blanc thing uh stickers crayons yeah I don't know I guess a kid could like put these stickers down and draw on this for like five seconds and then be bored and move on to something else see this to me is like a kid size thing the Hammers got a great flavor to it this cheese yo Dawg with that sauce oh this is weird I have never in my life eaten apple sauce like this mmm it's way more convenient but I look like a creep I was on the train sucking on one of these mmm whoa oh my god this lemonade it tastes like lemonade okay uno deck this is actually interesting this is a magic 8-ball and then if you press the thing there yeah okay that's actually pretty cool KFC one crispy chicken leg check it out mac and cheese usually it includes an apple sauce but for various reasons I was not able to get one for this video a chicken great flavor hell yeah this mac and cheese is so good and also comes with a capri-sun I even had one of these since I don't know I played soccer when I was 10 good ah yeah it's like I'm put in an IV CAPRISA mmm Burger King cheeseburger yeah mmm fries I think only these guys McDonald's like actual burger and fries once again capri-sun oh yeah Capri Suns like getting in on the fast food game good for those guys beverages are so sugary so here's the toy from the Burger King kids menu I've no I really have no idea what this is number five is Wendy's and number four McDonald number three the number three slot goes to KFC number two goes to Burger King number one that I thought was the best was Arby's it was so good it was an awesome sandwich I liked everything about it I thought they did a great job I was very surprised and even though Arby's had a kid's menu so if I had children or for some weird reason how to take care of children I would definitely take them the RB seeds I don't know why I would be taking a kid to eat anything anywhere simply something that there's laws in place to stop that from happening
