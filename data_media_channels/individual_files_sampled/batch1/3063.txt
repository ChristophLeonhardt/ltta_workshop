why I believe this generation particularly the younger people don't really like labels and we don't we're not necessarily joiners or liking to label ourselves and I think that's that's great in its own right so I don't know about calling yourself a feminist I also for me it's difficult for me to call myself a feminist in the classic sense because it seems to be very anti nail and it certainly is very Pro abortion in this context and I'm neither anti-male or program so there's an individual feminism if you will that you make your own choices Mercedes I look at myself as a product of my choice is not a victim of my circumstances and I would just say I mean one thing that's been a little bit disappointing and revealing is that I hope will get better is turns out a lot of women they just have a problem with women in power you know this whole sisterhood this whole let's go March for women's right and you know just constantly talking about what women look like or what they wear or making fun of their choices or presuming that they're not as powerful as the men around this presumptive negativity about women and power I think it's very unfortunate because let's just try to access that and have a conversation about it rather than a confrontation about it
