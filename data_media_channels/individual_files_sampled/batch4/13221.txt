so this is reading from the article the course with the official title the truth about pornography of pornography literacy curriculum for high school students designed to reduce sexual and dating violence is a recent addition to start strong a peer leadership program for teenagers headquartered in Boston's South End and funded by the city's public health agency about two dozen selected high school students attend every year most of them black or Latino along with a few Asian students from Boston public high schools including the cities so on and on during most of the year the teenagers learned about healthy relationships dating violence and LGBT issues as opposed to English and history and math but often through group discussions role-playing and other exercise you know I mean so what they're teaching them is the point isn't necessarily reality I mean that's a very sad answer it's a very sad answer and yet and yet what are the other answers Ross do thought in reaction to this piece Rasta thought is the Catholic op-ed writer who used to be a lot better before Trump but now I think the New York Times just does not let people write what they actually think anyway he nap he wrote a piece called let's ban porn and he says the belief that it should not be restricted as a mistake the belief that it can not be censored is a superstition law and jurisprudence changed once to allow porn and can change again and while you can find anything somewhere on the internet making hardcore porn something to be quested after in dark corners would dramatically reduce its pedagogical role its cultural normalcy its power over libidos everywhere and Peter sudirman at reason of course reason is a libertarian side they don't to ban anything he says he answers due thought by saying to start with you would need to stop the production of porn by business enterprises forcing at minimum every person who has ever attended the Adult Video News Awards in a professional capacity to immediately find a new line of work you would need to find a way to stop a slew of high-profile incredibly lucrative websites from posting hosting or otherwise distributing explicit materials after you crack down on the pros you would need to go after amateurs by finding some way to stop tens of millions of iphone wielding Americans from making home movies many of which would resemble professional products and quality you know what what's interesting about this not men at might by nature I'm a libertarian but I really see this as a plague and it's not the Lakes not porn the plague is an attitude to the human body and to human relationships that was sold to us by the left all from the 60s to today and now that they're reaping the whirlwind they don't like it very much it's interesting when you look at the great ages of civilizations if you think about the Augustine age of the ancient Rome if you think about the Victorian age if you think about it the American 1950s they're all marked by at least an outward display of prudery and it's always pretty that comes after a libertine age so in America we have the 1920s and the 1930s and anything goes you know in the olden days a glimpse of stocking was looked onto something shocking now but by the 1950s not so much and that was the Golden Age of this generation of this cycle of Americanism Victorian age same thing in the 1700s lots of sex lots of books about sex oh you know Tom Jones and and things like that by the 1800s by the Victorian age everybody is as you know very prudish but that's also the great that's probably one of the greatest ages of human civilizations but one of the things is is that with that comes a new respect for women in the household and the Victorians would call her the eighth nickel the angel in the house the angel in the house and of course in the 1950s the housewife was one of the key elements of all entertainment all ideas so what's interesting is the feminism feminism has always had this reactionary shadow ok first they say yes we're men and women should have the same kind of sex and then oh my god you know women are being abused this is no good this is no good they've always had this idea that men's desires should be prohibited that sex that porn was bad they've always had a strain of feminism the porn would been and would be interesting if feminism morphed in the same way that the left has morphed the side of free speech has now morphed into the side of no speech it would be interesting and I do think this could happen that feminism morphs into actual feminism the defence of women in their roles as guiding families guiding men civilizing men now when you say that without women men would be uncivilized feminists start screaming at you and say it's not our role to feminize to civilize men it's not our role to civilize men and they don't like living in a world without civilized men in it and women are the only things that civilized men do you know all this me too movement is living in a world where women have lost their power to civilize men have lost their mission to civilize men have lost their mission to form men in families and in in marriage and they don't like so much what happens when that looks like yeah when they don't like so much what that looks like when that actually actually happens so I have many times predicted a new Victorian age is coming I do believe that is true and it will be interesting to see if feminism morphs into the leader of some of that Victorian prudery and some of that Victorian elevation of the family
