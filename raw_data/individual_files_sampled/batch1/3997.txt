the cool thing about buying from Ella beam is any of their l.l.bean branded products come with their satisfaction guarantee and what that means is that for as long as you own the item if you're ever dissatisfied with it you can just pop into any ill bean store and say hey this part of the item broke and I would like a new one to test that return policy as a reporter I actually went to an LL Bean store and took four year-old shoes and said hey the stitching on the toe broke I don't know what you guys can do for me but I love some kind of you know refund and they were 4-year old shoes and they looked like 4-year old shoes and the woman behind the counter she said where they bought in the last two years I sheepishly say no and she gets right to work typing in the product and ten minutes later I walked away with a slip that they were gonna be shipped to my apartment in two days in this particular instance with my boots I wore them for several years the soles were totally worn down the stitching was kind of coming out this after after several years of hard use I mean this was a well made product eight nine years after the fact I got the boots resold and restaged with my vintage chocolate brown that last I checked you cannot get in the catalog in 2016 and I was back up and running with like a shoe that's not even on the market freshly crafted for just for me it was amazing it's money well spent because you know that you might be spending $100 for the pair of boots upfront but you're basically getting unlimited pairs if you know if something goes wrong
