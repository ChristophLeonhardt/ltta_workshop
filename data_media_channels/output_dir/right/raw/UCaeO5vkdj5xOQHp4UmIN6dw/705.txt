1
00:00:00,820 --> 00:00:03,730
- C is for Constitution.

2
00:00:03,730 --> 00:00:07,240
According to leftists, The
Constitution is the sacred

3
00:00:07,240 --> 00:00:10,370
law of the land bequeathed
to us for the greatest

4
00:00:10,370 --> 00:00:12,040
political thinkers of all time.

5
00:00:13,645 --> 00:00:15,190
No, I'm kidding they hate it.

6
00:00:15,190 --> 00:00:18,980
You see The Constitution
enumerates or specifies

7
00:00:18,980 --> 00:00:22,290
the powers of the federal
government so that Americans

8
00:00:22,290 --> 00:00:26,090
know that all other powers not
mentioned in the Constitution

9
00:00:26,090 --> 00:00:27,450
belong to the individual

10
00:00:27,450 --> 00:00:29,350
and the state and local governments.

11
00:00:29,350 --> 00:00:31,950
That's not so good for
leftists because they want

12
00:00:31,950 --> 00:00:34,030
the federal government
to be able to control

13
00:00:34,030 --> 00:00:37,710
and limit your businesses,
your associations, your speech,

14
00:00:37,710 --> 00:00:41,030
your religious practices, and
anything else they don't like.

15
00:00:41,030 --> 00:00:43,730
Now, the Constitution would prevent that.

16
00:00:43,730 --> 00:00:46,280
Unfortunately according to leftists,

17
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:49,350
the Constitution is a living document.

18
00:00:49,350 --> 00:00:51,850
It's not like other boring old documents

19
00:00:51,850 --> 00:00:53,950
that just lie around with words on them

20
00:00:53,950 --> 00:00:57,500
that have the same old
meanings all the time.

21
00:00:57,500 --> 00:01:00,520
No, as a living document, the Constitution

22
00:01:00,520 --> 00:01:03,030
can just wake up in the
middle of the night,

23
00:01:03,030 --> 00:01:06,340
drift into its study and
entirely rewrite itself

24
00:01:06,340 --> 00:01:09,830
so that by morning you'd
hardly even recognize it.

25
00:01:09,830 --> 00:01:12,350
For instance, the
Constitution used to give

26
00:01:12,350 --> 00:01:14,690
the federal government absolutely no power

27
00:01:14,690 --> 00:01:18,380
to regulate what laws the
states made regarding sex

28
00:01:18,380 --> 00:01:20,210
or marriage or abortion.

29
00:01:20,210 --> 00:01:23,070
And that was no good because
leftists know exactly

30
00:01:23,070 --> 00:01:24,960
what everyone should think and do

31
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:27,360
about sex and marriage and abortion,

32
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:30,210
so there shouldn't be
any disagreement allowed.

33
00:01:30,210 --> 00:01:33,360
But remember, the Constitution is alive.

34
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:36,650
So one day a living
Constitution was sitting down

35
00:01:36,650 --> 00:01:39,830
on the back porch washing
down a bree smeared slice

36
00:01:39,830 --> 00:01:42,230
of almond cake with a glass of Chardonnay

37
00:01:42,230 --> 00:01:45,770
when suddenly it had a
wonderful idea and lept up

38
00:01:45,770 --> 00:01:49,040
from the porch swing so very
quickly that The New Yorker

39
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:51,553
fell from its lap before
it even had a chance

40
00:01:51,553 --> 00:01:55,160
to finish the 30,000
word essay on the life

41
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:58,940
of French feminist
lithographer Louise Hervieu.

42
00:01:58,940 --> 00:02:00,970
"I know.", the Constitution said.

43
00:02:00,970 --> 00:02:04,530
"I'll just insert some new
words into the penumbra

44
00:02:04,530 --> 00:02:05,870
"of my emanations.

45
00:02:05,870 --> 00:02:07,585
"You won't be able to see the words.

46
00:02:07,585 --> 00:02:10,729
"In fact, you won't be
able to see the penumbras

47
00:02:10,729 --> 00:02:12,220
"and emanations either,

48
00:02:12,220 --> 00:02:14,880
"but you'll know the new
words are there all right

49
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:18,670
"because five unelected
justices will say they're there.

50
00:02:18,670 --> 00:02:21,910
"And that will make
them magically appear."

51
00:02:21,910 --> 00:02:25,400
Lickety split as quick as you
can say democracy is a thing

52
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:28,490
of the past, the
Constitution rewrote itself

53
00:02:28,490 --> 00:02:30,880
and now allows the federal government

54
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:33,730
to do just about anything it wants.

55
00:02:33,730 --> 00:02:37,510
Yes, a living document
is an amazing thing.

56
00:02:37,510 --> 00:02:40,400
You can put all the words
in it you like and yet

57
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:43,890
they still remain almost
entirely meaningless

58
00:02:43,890 --> 00:02:48,570
until they mean exactly
what leftists want them to.

59
00:02:48,570 --> 00:02:50,650
C is for Constitution.

60
00:02:51,690 --> 00:00:00,000
