there's been a lot of talk recently about white privilege and many of you may have been wondering what is white privilege probably not but I'm going to tell you anyway white privilege is when liberals have so few problems that they have the privilege of sitting around complaining about white privilege you can see white privilege in the liberal arts departments of left-wing universities for example at these universities there are college professors who don't have to know about anything but their own opinions and who can't lose their jobs because they have tenure these people have it's so easy that the only thing they can think to complain about is white privilege that's white privilege but you may ask if white privilege means having it so easy that all you have to complain about is white privilege can black people have white privilege too oh absolutely say you're a black actor who makes a freaking fortune on TV by showing up for a few hours every week dressing up as a poor person and reading line someone wrote for you about how white people have white privilege you now have so few problems in life that you not only have the white privilege to complain about white privilege you have even more white privilege than a white person with white privilege because you're black so you also have the white privilege of never being accused of having white privilege many black people of course do not have white privilege these are black people who live in cities run by liberals liberal welfare policies have created a culture of dependency for these black people and liberal teachers unions have kept them too uneducated to rise above it liberal sexual policies have helped create a horrific plague of illegitimate see which is mired these black people in generational poverty and liberal attacks on police have left these black people in neighborhoods so violent that they are almost like war zones how do liberals help these people whose lives they've helped destroy by complaining about white privilege why because they have white privilege so screw the black people whose lives they helped destroy now to be fair some liberals do try to help these black people whose lives they helped destroy how by pulling down statues to oppose white privilege why the liberals pull down statues instead of changing the policies that have helped destroy the lives of black people because their policies haven't destroyed their lives in fact their policies make them feel great about themselves and what is it called when you help destroy the lives of black people but feel great about yourself while uselessly pulling down statues to oppose white privilege you guessed it it's called white privilege so in conclusion the best way to tell if you have white privilege is if you're complaining about white privilege because believe me if you didn't have white privilege you'd really have something to complain about trigger warning I'm Andrew Clavin and this is the Andrew Clavin

guys from the banking system come in to carry me away so you know one of the things about about these the news these days is I sit around I'm sure everybody does this I surround and I'm not sure what I'm seeing because everybody's got such strong opinions and the news law the news people lie and of course politicians lie and so sometimes you're sitting there looking at something and you you don't know what it is last night I watched this rally and it looked to me like Donald Trump as Godzilla stomping on these on CNN and the rest of the news media while they ran around like the Japanese people in those world you know Japanese monster movie it's like a week and a half they've been poking him with this charlottesville thing very unfairly I have to say I've talked about how I didn't think he handled it like he should have handled it but they would have been totally unfair to him saying he's defending Nazis he's not defending white supremacist he's not that he is a white supremacist that Republicans are not so they're poking him and poking him in but he's like ah I think after watching it and I'm gonna show you why but I think I think we've earned a Trump happiness montage do we I got it blow it blow it we're gonna win so much we're gonna win at every level we're gonna win economically we're gonna win with the economy we're gonna win with military we're gonna win with house carrots for our veterans we're gonna win with every single facet do you does it to be you my oh my what a wonderful day we're gonna win so much you may even get tired of winning yeah you'll say please please it's too much winning we can't take it anymore I feel pretty oh so pretty I feel pretty and witty and guess we have to keep winning I was I was laughing so hard cuz he just knows where they live and the thing that he's done you know he's kind of like a comedian dealing with a heckler my father was a comedian he told me you let a heckler hit you like two or three times before you go after him because then the audience is on your side you know you just rip him apart that's a week and a half of this nonsense about Charlottesville in the way he dealt with it but the thing is what he did what he has done in Charlottesville is so important because he's violating the great left-wing media taboo which is which is a taboo on saying anything that even seems racist but but they way they define that is that if you don't support leftist policies you're racist and then when they catch you on being racist you're supposed to apologize and say oh my goodness I seemed races tacitly making it defending left-wing policies making it impossible to say you know there shouldn't be welfare in these places that just turn people into dependents they shouldn't be teachers unions you know they always say the teachers you know who's going to teach the children teachers unions don't teach people they don't teach people they just destroy schools and they destroy lives and all these people and you know like oh you're gonna go in and tell black people you know about their sex lives well yeah if they're having this this legitimacy plague that is destroying their our fellow citizens of course we're gonna talk to them just like we would anybody else when what Trump did you're not in calling out both sides and calling out the violent left and like I said he didn't do it as well as I would have liked him to do it but in calling out both sides I'm pointing out that there is a problem with files much more of a problem with violence on the Left let's face it there how many Nazis and Ku Klux Klan people are there in the cut that country we probably fit him into a room in this building somewhere which would be a good place to keep just lock the door and they'd be but but the left is really a problem so he's stripping the media of their power to embarrass and turn him toxic everybody around him is running for their lives you know so you know I don't want to be tight cuz you know the CNN into New York Times and Trump is just standing there and fighting back if the these people have an ounce of courage they would stand with them salutely listen to him turn on the media I mean and this is hilarious this is just the beginning of what he did what happened in Charlottesville strikes at the core of America and tonight this entire arena stands United in forceful condemnation of the thugs who perpetrate hatred and violence but the very dishonest media those people right up there with all the calories and I mean truly dishonest people in the media and the fake media they make up stories they have no sources in many cases they say a source says there is no such thing but they don't report the facts just like they don't want to report that I spoke out forcefully against hatred bigotry and violence and strongly condemned the neo-nazis the white supremacist and the KKK I openly called for unity healing and love and they know it because they were all there this is first of all just leaving the press out of it for a minute he's got his people cheering against the KKK and the Nazis cheering against the haters and that for people of goodwill is a good thing this is a movement this is these are you know this is a powerful powerful man with a big big audience who loves him and now they know they know he has now brought them with him over to the side of the anti hater so that's that's great for everybody that's that's good for everybody but at the same time he then goes on and I'm not gonna play the whole thing I went on forever but it was gloriously funny he goes he starts to read the statements that he made and he says you know I when I talked against hate and then the next day they said oh that's not enough call up the KKK so I called out the KKK and then I - the next day I talked about lovingly I say we lovin and then I made this speech and he goes on and on and it's all true I mean this is the other thing it's all true so the the news media he's saying well he left out the fact he left out the fact that he said that there were problems on all sides and on both sides and this is the thing they've been hitting him with but guess what we know that because that's all they've been saying all this time so all he was saying is yes I may have said that but I also said these things and you know these are the things he said and it's kind of unimpeachable stuff you know he the way he talks in the way he made it sound and that one line that one line that they keep hitting him with about the fact that he said they're good people on both sides Matt Lauer said the vice president you know have you ever met a good person on the Nazi side but he wasn't talking about that everybody knows it they were T was talking about the people who opposed tearing down statues he was saying there were good people well you know Pro on both sides of that issue and I don't know if there were any good people who shut it all seem pretty pretty nasty to me but like okay that so he's calling him out so now he's taken away oh and then he does a couple of other just brilliant things I'll just mention I don't want to play the whole thing cuz it's just when it was it was kind of long you know but he's talking about the fact about the elites and you've been everybody is attacking the elites and he says you know what I live in the White House you know I went to all these good schools I got better grades than they did maybe were the elites he's talking to all these people and then what's wonderful about him is here he is this born millionaire this guy was born with a silver spoon in his mouth talking to people who've never seen a silver spoon and saying ah you know we are all elites together and you are with me it was it was genius stuff it really was it was peak Trump and your waiter you know it was peak Trump is cause the media went nuts I mean it was unbelievable first of all I should add two I should add to that out in the streets there are leftist protesters all week long we've been hearing I like oh you know anti father violence what CNN say is violence in the name of peace it's peace through violence like that I'm gonna get a little tag on my clothes as at peace through Vaughn Andrew Klavan peace through violence so he's the only people outside are the left and they're throwing stuff at the cops and the cops unleash on so they're rioting I mean we have some oh yeah here's a cut number 8 showing number 8 this is like a video if you can see it's like a a black Trump supporter can you can you play yeah it's a black Trump supporter trying to get out of here and this clown jumps on his truck the pickup truck and slugs him so these guys are beating up black guys cuz they're not the official black guys because they're supporting Trump these white guys white leftists telling black people they're not black enough not to be punched in the face by antiphon okay so then then we cut to CNN and this was the highlight of my evening I mean I I I haven't had so much fun in a long time it was really good but let's start with Don Lemon Don Lemon the stupidest man on television except for Chris Cuomo who would be the stupidest man on television except for Don Lemon I told I think ban is gonna be on his show I told them if you put them together they'll have an average IQ of 90 lemon they cut back the thought lemon after this speech and of course CNN has now just been forced to cover Trump ripping them and here's lemons shocked reaction he's unhinged it's embarrassing and I don't mean for us the media because he went after us but for the country this is who we elected president of the United States a man who is so pitted pedy that he has to go after people who he deems to be his enemy like an imaginary friend of a six-year-old his speech was without thought it was without reason it was devoid of facts it was devoid of wisdom there was no gravitas there was no sanity there he was like a child blaming a sibling on something else he did it I didn't do it he certainly opened up the race wound from Charlottesville a man clearly wounded by the rational people who are abandoning him in droves meaning those business people and the people in Washington now who are questioning his fitness for office and whether he is stable good commentary everybody loves how could he do that he must
