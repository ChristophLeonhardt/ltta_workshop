if you're ready I'm gonna kneel on stage I'm gonna hand the mic off to you and we'll be good to go hello and welcome to Politico we're so glad to see so many of you out here in support of such an important conversation in topic today now without further ado please welcome the moderator of the Muslims for progressive values radicals refugees and Republicans panel singer songwriter producer and founder of Muslims for progressive values ani zona Bell welcome my name is Annie and I'm really excited to be hosting this panel here at politican I'm a big fan of political comm the title of the the panel today is radical refugees and Republicans and just a quick rundown background of the the title is that we wanted to address the issue of refugees given the policy the of of the Trump administration and the unfortunate linking of refugees with radicalism and just sort of to get the audience that we wanted we threw in the word the other are Republican in there so my first question to you all is with a show of hands how many of you are Republicans okay a good amount but not enough but anyway so I'm gonna go down the list here our panelists and introduce you to them and then we'll get straight into the discussion he's a Fox News senior correspondent who covered the Iraq war from the Middle East and who was one of the first on site during the Sunbird enira attack Adam Housley TV host author and sad satire is called John the John Stewart of the Middle East Egyptian expat and Time magazine pioneer and and I should add a new child to a new dad as well as of yesterday that's it that's it's not you're sure Turkish raised a social media sensation BuzzFeed contributor and host of the young turks the breakdown segment and the pop trigger entertainment channel Hasan piker okay International International counter trafficking advisor and traumatologist specializing in survivors of human trafficking radicalized youth war refugees terrorism and violence dr. Halas adiga siddell today and to my left bond villian actor musician and cultural critic robert davi so right getting right into it the first thing we're gonna do is we're gonna do definition sometimes we talk a lot about what refugees are and what immigrants are actually don't know what those technical definitions are so we're going to go to the expert or here on the panel with dr. aller to do the definitions so you've all been hearing a lot about refugees in the media and refugees are individuals who've been forced to leave their countries due to persecution war and mass violence whereas immigrants are individuals who've chosen to resettle in a designated country so that will kind of cover the span of our discussion to operationalize those terms for everyone today so while economic migrants similar to immigrants in many respects have to resettle to a specific country or designated area due to inability to find work and survive however are not facing the same severity as refugees so just to recap again one more time refugees because that's what we're focusing on today and they're not the rest of it but the focus of our discussion are refugees who have been forced to leave their countries due to war mass violence and persecution so moving forward what we're gonna do is we can I'd like to take the perspective of the issue of fear there's a lot of fear on the issue of refugees there's a ban on refugees entering the United States for 120 days based on president Trump's executive order so that that's fine I understand so let's address the fear factor the issue of security of America I'm an American first I just so happen to be Muslim okay so so let's get that straight just because I'm Muslim doesn't mean that I'm any less concerned about American security got it Robert what is your perspective on the issue of refugees and the issue of security in America and how can we be both compassionate or should we to what extent should we welcome refugees oh and just want to go down the panel just to get your perspectives on this well my perspective is one of the common-sense compassion and safety and awareness and there's a variety of elements that go into the whole issue that unfortunately in the news bites you don't get an in-depth understanding of a lot of it the ban is a temporary ban that's because not only immigration system is broken and the vetting process is broken in terms of who's coming into our nation from certain countries that's no secret it makes sense to me that when there's a massive amount of people moving from one part of the world to another and that part of the world has a radicalized element that wants to see certain harm to other elements other countries I mean in Egypt there was a gentleman named Syed Kitab in the 60s who wrote a book called in the shade of the Quran he was educated in the United States and the 50s went to Egypt taught in the universities was arrested he's kind of the father philosopher of al-qaeda the Muslim Brotherhood and he is the one that said death to Christians Jews in the West this is since the 60s he wrote a book he took mine comp and he wrote this equivalent the Arabic equivalent called in the shade of the Koran understanding that this is a cultural movement or a political movement ideology that has infected Islam and I had the first Islamic conference last year at Politico what is Islam in the 21st century I asked them and I had some Sufis and some other Islamic they understand because there's so many different sects of Islam within Islam but in terms of refugee and in terms of understanding that the threat that could be infiltrated it takes one to three and then I'm saying you don't have a compassion but the system is broken it'd be like the system here being broken when you had to come in through a detective if you guys have to come in through a detector yeah all right me right look at my little face I had to go through the Tegrity but but what happens is if that was broken down all our safety it would take one person to hurt the safety of this room so that's in terms of thing I think it's a common-sense approach now it's a temporary bed until that gets fixed and then you can let more people in also what was stirring to me and I did do it I was in Estonia recently I did a concert there and I met the Barbara Walters of Estonia she was a female journalist and another female journalist wrote a book early on called the force of reason Oriana Fallaci was a very left-wing journalist but wrote the book called the force of reason and she coined the term Arabia she was the first one now this journalist I met was very Pro refugee and then she went to Budapest and did a documentary and the influx of refugees and the danger of all that I understand but the danger of is the lack of assimilation and the anger and I'm saying that all refugees are radicalized but there is a displacement and this proportion of displacement and when you lead so many people in I think the better idea was to create a beautiful safe zone it was always stunning to me that in Israel that the Gaza Strip didn't look like Disneyland with all the money I went to Jordan in 1994 met with King Hussein the father and I said you know with all the Arab money why don't you guys let the Gaza Strip instead it and I played a Palestinian Peter so you know 1988 but why isn't a Gaza Strip why couldn't it be built up like a certain kind of anyway okay your turn will come bass and dr. Holly you might want to talk about also sorry you want to talk let them okay Adam I mean as a journalist who's been in seen a lot of these areas for work I will say that putting politics aside because that's what my job is to do and there is no more compassionate people or country in this world in America despite all of our faults and flaws and we have a lot of them there's no doubt when I give an example when I was in Thailand we one of the first people on the ground there horrific scenes I heard back in the States from my family when I had a chance to call back we were working crazy hours that there was a lot of criticism over the money that was pledged money pledged and boots on the ground or two different things and the fact is when I've been to Haiti or whatever it happens to be and I'm not saying we always do good I'm gonna put the war zone with the war situation aside talk just about refugee situations we are the first usually on the ground with boots doing work hands down no doubt American military members and NGOs and also regular citizens I saw I met Americans of all walks of life all colors that came from Australia on vacation out of parts of Asia that flew to Thailand to help other countries do amazing stuff too not discounting any of their work but fact is there is no doubt that we do the most primarily cause of our size on our money having said that the problem with refugees in this country right now and with with radicalism and with the issue of what's happening in North Africa and the Middle East is that everything has been politicized right away to get in this now where people first thing you say is well you're for the ban then you're racist if you're against the band then you're an idiot and no one ever actually looks at the depth of both arguments which in a lot of cases we all want the same thing in this room we can all sit down and I guarantee you we're probably gonna agree on 90% of everything at least maybe more Democrats Republicans included but we always focus on the nine to ten percent we don't agree on so how you're gonna build a bridge when you start the middle the valley so you got to start on the ends come to that bridge we can get to those disagreements we can work through them but we never do and this is this topic actually is one of the most clear topics in the country that shows that divide that we out probably are gonna agree on 90% of this and then we can focus on the 10 we go backwards I appreciate that and I really do I think it there is a lot that we can do together as Americans and that's why I think that we should be we should be resolving a lot of the issues that divide that we have a lot of it is sort of fake actually and I think that we have a lot more in common than we you can hear it next door yeah no I'm serious notice respect to what's happening next door I watched a little bit of the debate between Tommy and I forgot the other girl's name I'm sorry thank you I know I know her I met him I met him both but no disrespect I love the energy it's great to have people that are invested in what they believe in but that is that helping I don't know you guys might be late and my I'm come to the news world so I say no Besim your turn what's your all right so since I just got my baby which is my anchor baby here now so Oh his name is Adam and there and the reason it's a TSA friendly name which is we had actually to go through a lot of process because my first choice for the alley the second choice with Hassan and I cannot name him because I'm gonna give him the life of hell and airports all his life so the only name that is done does not get like change from between Arabic and English with Adam which is a very interesting that like I have to think about that while just doing a very simple test like naming Isis a Jewish name - it's an it said he is like he is the name I mean he was the father of all of us so which actually brings me to the topic of what one of the things that you said in the beginning itch is fear I mean listen he I agree with you yes 90% of the stuff we agree upon but it's the 9 or 10% that's actually hurting a lot of people there when you when every time you hear refugees but they're radicalized they're people that we have compassion but some of them can kill us you actually can lead to a narrative that you're gonna be afraid of anybody who looks different than you and this is why there were like three Indians Indian six who are neither Muslim neither refugees needed from the media's got killed on gap they got shot this is the kind of narrative that I'm worried about the refugees I mean it is only the surface of the problem when I was in there covering the RA at the RNC all I heard for three days is illegal immigrants and radical terrorists Islamists and of course that we don't mean all emitters we don't mean all Islamists all the Muslims we just need mean they're radical and we mean they're illegal but as useless into it for three days all you listen to is or you here is immigrants and Muslims so this is the problem that we're having you have people here who like I was interviewing people who thought that Obama is overseeing training camps outside of New York for Isis operatives but well this that's not the majority of the country but it this came from somewhere some people who think there are training camps and some people who think that anybody who looks Brown who is a Muslim he's a danger though so that so the thing is like and I'm talking to your about like I'm not talking about this I'm talking about Fox News I'm talking about in food I'm not gonna go there you're talking is that true that you are talking about like I'm just called you listen you're talking about the problem you're talking about the problem you're talking a narrative of fear that's making everybody worried about these people coming from overseas peep those people actually have fled war-torn countries and they're actually respond I mean like I mean like I mean of course you can yeah we can do that yes but like the thing is I'm worried about the fear I'm worried about people who are neither immigrants neither refugees neither they had to go through the sea to actually to come here people who might be legal citizens here who would be affected by this kind of fear it doesn't stop at refugees it doesn't stop at Muslims there are people as a matter of fact after 9/11 the first victim of a hate crime from people who were very angry at at Muslims after 9/11 was a Christian Egyptian Copts who was running a convenience store in New York because we look like each other you look the same so this is this is my worry it's the narrative of fear Hassan so we talked about the divide and we talk about fear mongering against Muslims and then we have a president in the White House right now that essentially made a name for himself in the political discourse faced by this lie that Obama was actually not an American citizen and a lot of palete a lot of people believe that narrative so when you and it goes to that same concept of the Muslim ban is is far too overreaching and not not even solving a single aspect of the problem because if you look at the first even when we talk at this panel like when you look at the introduction of this panel this is the clash of the warfare among civilizations is Lomb is the other Islam worse is versus westerns like when you look at Donald Trump's of speech in Poland this is all a part of the Steve Bannon manifesto if you looked a little bit deeper into Steve bandhans manifesto you'll realize that that he is trying to portray the world as Western civilization's versus Islam that is a terrifying narrative when considering the fact that the 33 percent of the world's population are Muslim were like how how will we solve that problem why are you denying what I just said about Syed Kitab who took mine conf and made in the shade of the Quran nobody we know as a matter of fact site public reaction safe food was a Muslim Brotherhood leader yes he came in and he helped radicalize yes do you see anybody here who was a promising brother he mentioned Steve bannon's dick dick West against no we never started West against Islam it's not about to say yes yes but like site Pope is a guy a radical a fringe and he was not an advisor to a present okay wait I was called hot always calm or audience so I wanted to share something with you kindly entertain this tell me what you what your thoughts are often when you know I treat a lot of victims of human trafficking and gender-based violence and rape and these horrific things that have a have experienced people often blame them for it you know it's a psychosexual issue brings up a lot of shame and they call this fundamental attribution error in social psychology it's a defense mechanism so could this be a defense mechanism potentially our irrational fear of peoples who have suffered an immense amount of trauma torture violence and when given the opportunity to resettle and have homeostasis and have what we have thrive and are incredibly resilient and so I ask you and I appeal to your compassion as people is that is could this potentially be a defense mechanism what is the rationale since 2001 ever and every refugee we've ever resettled have success terrorist attack on American soil harming Americans no Syrians no not successfully so and the percentage that's not that model minority doesn't always does not reflect the whole so the irrationality again the defense mechanism that this represents is dis uniting us and our discourse around it this is the issue fear and trauma is being weaponized so the very thing the very rhetoric that that instigates one second of dr. hamer one second is being weaponized and the children I see in my office who've been quote-unquote recruited from all sorts of domestic terrorist organizations and a few foreign foreign terrorist organizations as well bullying trauma alienation that is what perpetuates this so I have a I have a question for you how do you think we can disrupt this and do you see this as a defense mechanism as an inner as an irrational fear so I'd like to you person in the back you need to shut up because because you're actually being rude because we are trying to have a conversation if you don't want to have a conversation then please leave because there's a lot of others that do want to have a conversation about it it's called a big game of speech until everybody like if you're so goddamn triggered who you can see yourself the fuck out this this this is exactly what I was talking about in my intro the back and forth knows respect to you I understand where you're coming from I understand why you feel that way but I'm telling you that the majority in this country don't feel that way and that if we're going to find that 9 or 10 percent whatever the percentage is it's not scientific then the rest of us have to come together and then we can focus on that and I understand why you want that person to leave but the way I handle it is we need to go at this in a way where we're all in the same page hawing as wanna go hey dude seriously let it go or go rather than yelling and screaming and saying the guy's an idiot shut up that's the problem we have right now because of listen my wife as long as I mentioned this is my wife is black I'm white she happens to be in Hollywood anybody who follows us knows that we're attacked it everybody thinks I work for Fox News and I love Donald Trump I didn't vote for either one of them God's honest truth the point is it doesn't matter if I did because it's my right so my point is if we're gonna go further in this panel and on this in this tape we've all gotta at least respect the fact that each of us have an opinion and it may be different and so on it doesn't hurt you then we should be able to talk about it otherwise we're never going to solve anything thank you one second let me say something I want to go back to the issue of safe zone Adam and I really appreciate you saying that all sojanet generosity of America that is no hands down America is the most generous nation in the world on the issue of say stone on the issue of say zone one thing that there was a refugee that just got off the boat of one of the islands of Greece and there was a media the media reported I went microphones straight into his face getting off the boats you you're from Syria what do you think could have been done differently to save Syria and this guy he said he was a doctor it says you know what I don't be a refugee I don't want to be on that boat I don't want to leave Syria but I had to because there was no safe zone created we were being bombarded every single day by side but bias by American allies so it's for some people what you have to understand is the trauma the doctor haleh alluded to it's not just that it's that they don't want to be refugees and I think we also have to flip that table we have to try to understand it from their perspective not just from our perspective I just hope that when we leave this room today is that I really appeal that we do listen to each other we do as Americans we seriously do need to listen to each other respectfully and the interruption is just is escalating the hostility that we don't need please yes on immigration for a second because the migrants eat you tell you in America I'm italian-american my grandparents came from Sicily and Naples in 1886 there were more lynchings of Italians than blacks than any other race 1906 the New York Times said the Italian is dirtier and lower than the Negro that's just a common fact Italians were changing their last names because we were I'm from Sicily the Arabic influence everything else we were looked at as second class third class fourth class scum of the earth citizens but the italian-american there was something that didn't have that aspect to it that has to be addressed in terms of the radicalization and I'm not saying I've been to the Middle East how welcoming it is in the countries I've been to Turkey unbelievable Jordan I mean the the the the the the support and the the acceptance of Americans the hospitality but there is a certain element of that and that's where the the mindset is and it's not it's not bad of Americans to be cautious to have the compassion of course of the refugee plight and understand that people our children are being affected by and young kids because when you seeing something and you're seeing a certain group of people because I saw it as a kid as an Italian you know I mean the beginning they go whap oh I understood that feeling but at the same time we didn't as you are doing as with having by discovery or by conversations the acceptance in the community say we're safe here we're Americans now the problem is when I went to London and the police tell me don't go there because it's under Sharia jurisdiction but that's true but but that's true but see you could shake your head it's not true but it is true it is true don't go there it's under Sharia jurisdiction what what what what does that say about the assimilation and the ability to assimilate America is only afraid America is only concerned of the inability of Islam to assimilate into our culture and and that's what I'm saying that's they're not going to say it because it's politically incorrect or they don't want to be but that's really the basis of it all how do we get through that I am very glad that you brought up the part about Italians being treated as second-class citizen which is like more than a hundred years ago since then we have evolved and I am but the thing is and we have evolved enough to know that we should not do that to other human beings so that's one thing the second thing let's talk let's talk since we all love statistics let's talk about Muslims in America Muslims here in America are the second most educated subgroup after Jewish people here they are Muslim women are more likely to go have higher education than Muslim men and they're more and more and more likely to have a professional job third 57% the your according to a pure search 57% of Muslims here in America believe there is more than one interpretation to Islam now I will agree with you that there is a virus there is a radicalization of the mainstream Islam nobody is here is denying it but a lot of people are fighting that and most of the people are fighting there two people who have left the Islamic world who are still fighting it back now those people who are fighting there kind of zatia n they are persecuted they are not mostly persecuted by the Ayatollah they are persecuted by the secular military regimes who are supported by the Western Area Western administration's in Europe and in America it's been all going all that because somebody told them it's better to go with a secular and they're not secular secular military dictator then going with a radicalized Islamic government both of them are worse than each other it's horrible both of them are two sides of the same coin so the thing is when Anna and I understand the P at the gentlemen the back o select it's the problem with Islam you know what Islam has a lot of stuff that can scare you but so does the Bible so does the the Old Testament but they think that thing is Christianity did not evolve it was Christian societies that evolved and this is what we want to that what we're fighting for is one movement from month for Muslim societies to evolve and Muslims cannot evolve and Muslims cannot evolve a Muslim no sir Sir sir Sir sir Nana I did not finish my point I did not finish my point but sir people speak Christianity did not go through Reformation it is the interpretation that went through firmage because it's the same Bible the same then the same Quran exists in the 50s and 60s wear hijabs in Egypt was considered as an anomaly something happened in the last 40 years it was radicalized by the Wahhabism and by them the Saudi money who actually been infused and by the way so you can try to get people from the Westboro Church give them a country of their own give them all gifts and weapon give them money and let's see how Christianity will evolve so the thing is so that and the thing is it's the same Saudi Arabia has its action which is the biggest ally of the United States and when King Abdullah died last year every single American official present past and future went there hurried to his funeral so there's a little bit of a Apocrypha even Donald Trump who consistently criticized Hillary Clinton we went there for a hundred and ten billion dollars of weapon deals he gave more money to Saudi Arabia than Barack Obama did so that Saudi Arabia could can constantly bomb Yemen just like we do so that children in Yemen are terrified when the skies are clear because that means that there could be a drone strike at any given moment it's 2007 and the awesome one at a time please sorry that is the reality that they live in the Middle East and then we bombed their countries we systemically destroy any sort of hope that they may have for building a democratic institution and when they run away from those wars that we've caused for the most part then we deny them entry and then we act like they are the radical ones how is that compassionate they're on to something and I'm going to try to bring it back a little more towards the middle in the sense that the US the reason why we're talking about refugees coming from Syria is partly because of US policy so we're talking about what's happened and why they're coming here part of it is because Islam is dealing with an issue that most people that I know in the Middle East when I've been there and even though my friends here in America will agree with but there's a second part of it so it's not just an internal battle which we'll get to but it's also the external issues and and it goes to what you guys are talking about in the sense that we should care why the war in Syria started we should understand that the last administration it hasn't really reported and don't give it on all of our foreign policy in the not just this administration the last one when President Bush President Clinton they've all followed the same line with being beholden to the Saudis we did ship weapons into Jordan just like we shipped weapons into Libya the reason why and there's no easy answer that's the thing here the answer I think the problem is we've had no destroy the military-industrial complex that is one of the only industries in America that's why reality in reality we can winner talk about the military nostra complex until the cows go home in and I'm not saying it doesn't exist I'm not going back to the Eisenhower and all the common sea which goes strictly to the fact of this you had thugs in charge those countries you had a different foreign policy perspectives that the thought that the take to take those thugs out and put in a different way of leadership it was a good idea for America I'm not saying it was a good idea I'm telling you it's a bad idea we put our fingers and places all the time to cause problems the issue is that is where this all started when it comes to the external issues then we have to go to the internal what you're talking about we're to think we have to bring it back to because we consider and talk about the u.s. mistakes the European mistakes and how Israel was drawn wrong I mean considered we can bring up every topic you want to bring all the mistakes right and he brought up a point before in terms and I think this is because I'm a solution based I want solutions and this has been an issue that as I said in 1988 I played a Palestinian Allender sure which was the technical adviser on the movie I did terrorist on trial the United States of America versus elam ashur me say this is because I had a deep understanding of what was going on in the world back in 1988 having the research the philosophies that I did not understand and I had an empathy for it by playing the character my question is in Catholicism we have a pope the Catholic Church if there were people in the Catholic Church and they do this periodically in this there's one person that can say this is wrong we don't have that in Islam my thing was and I've been asking this for years the last couple of years why can't why are not the Islamic community and maybe it does I think it needs to get together to have a a conference in terms of defining Islam in the 21st century that's the solution of what's so necessary no but they should have not something that we should it should be it should be like huge all right I want to actually like answer this I know later I want Ali go ahead I just wanted to pose that question again what is something that's in our control is our perception our language and our attitude towards this and to engage that engage you what is what can you walk away doing from this dialogue have you spoken to refugee families before have you met them I am almost positive if you spent 25 30 minutes and your perception was the counter it would change there are no different than you I find again it's a strange irrational fear it's like fearing the person next to you there are people and let's bring it back down to the core of the issue something you have control over okay I have again I don't appreciate rudeness I just want to say something about the application process for becoming a refugee we had a Syrian member of our progressive Muslim community for about two plus years and he applied for refugee status here in the United States for two years and he did not get it and he was actually tortured in Assad's prison system for helping women who are demonstrating in the earlier part of the revolution process when it was still peaceful in the first year and he was providing food and shelter and because of that he was being jailed and tortured so what he did then he gave up he was very delusional with the process here in the United States and he applied to Belgium and within 12 weeks he received his refugee status in Belgium so he moved there brought his family there to Belgium this is to say that in the United States we have actually a really stringent process in place it is not easy to even secure a refugee prostatic so when we talk about refugees and how there is not a mechanism and in place that access chain is not true that is actually a political narrative that then says she falls but the issue is consist I think the people in this room need to know the issue with our refugee policy and all our immigration policies we don't have consistency anybody who knows anybody from Mexico who's illegal I grew up in California my best friend became little two years ago when Melendez friends and there's just no consistency and I think what the problem is if someone tries to come out and say consistency they generally are someone who supports the current president and that becomes an attack and if you're against consistency you hate the current president again we have to go back to the fine a common ground so one inconsistency does not mean keeping Muslims out it does not mean disliking somebody because of the color Scanlan I'm not saying this current policy is correct I'm not saying that at all I'm just saying we've got to have a consistent policy which we haven't had this administration the last administration go back as long as you want to go we haven't had consistency so I have a question hang on a son I have a question what is there anybody in the audience here who is a refugee or who has a family who was a refugee I would like to get a microphone to this person if you are a refugee in the last that was your process here in the United States in the last few years please put your hands up can we get a microphone to this person would you like to sorry I can't at first can I see their hands show of hands way up all so I can see okay the question was anybody here in the audience who came to United States as a refugee himself/herself okay I'm gonna give this gentleman up front here a microphone please could you stand up yeah hello hi what's your name my name is Emil right topo okay speak clearly into the microphone so we can hear you properly sorry about that I've never used one of these before yeah mine too too close my name is Emil right toggle and I'm a refugee came to America about 20 years ago from where Moldova former Soviet republic so what's your story from what I understand my parents experienced a lot of persecution back in Moldova for being Jewish my dad specifically is Jewish they gave a lot of stories how my dad has to like ghetto driver's license like to take the test like three times and they failed him twice just for being Jewish a lot of persecution and so from what I understand our situation it was incredibly difficult to get the visa to come over here it took a few years not really exactly sure how they applied but it was not an easy process and it definitely was a lot of screening from what I understand and how many years was at three to plus years I can't tell you exactly the details this is back in 95 though so situation may have changed since then okay there was another person in the audience here back and on that side over there okay this gentleman over here and the row one two three four my name is Vladimir thank you for sharing that story my name is Vladimir Univ I'm a refugee also from a former Soviet republic I was born in Tashkent Uzbekistan and my family came to the United States in 1993 fleeing persecution for being Jewish and it I have heard I was only a baby at the time but I've heard stories from my family since then about how difficult and time-consuming and arduous it was to do you every every step of the application process and then everything it took to become citizens eventually after after arriving here thank you one more person sorry one more person at the back there was a lady yeah hi my name is Sarah I I do have family members that are refugees my background just to give a little introduction about myself I'm half Syrian half Mexican I believe I embody the American spirit I'm a delegate as well so I'm really trying to you know focus on pushing pushing for American values and going back about my family members being refugees they were not given admission I'm the first Muslim ban they were refused to come here so that was very hard on my family but you know thankfully because of a federal judge they were able to come here and if it wasn't for the law they um they would have faced so much more difficult to use so that's my story thank you sorry we were talking about that originally Sonya resilient oh yeah so um going back to the consistency conversation there is one thing that the United States has consistently done and that is to absolutely destroy every part of Middle Eastern culture in any way shape or form they can but on top of but on side that hold on isten see if we're gonna talk about consistency you talk you wanna hey let's look at the Muslim band right originally when they first wrote the Muslim ban there was supposed to be a 90-day trial period for the Muslim band and these are Donald Trump's words until we figure out what's going on folks that's what he said and then months later when the Muslim ban was the turned over by the federal judge when the Supreme Court actually decided to put the Muslim ban in action that was already there months have gone by without any sort of problem solving so it was the Muslim ban really looking to eliminate some sort of problem with in radical refugees that might come here that we treat as though they are just skittles in a bowl and not real humans that are actually being oppressed every day in their countries partially because of the u.s. is efforts as foreign policy and then they still look to America as this this beam of light this hope that they want to come here and have a better life for themselves and then we deny access to them what is the what are we trying to solve with the Muslim ban really aside from just putting up forward some form of legislation that is strictly intolerant and divisive interfere so Adam what does show were you bringing out three people in the audience I think shows that we can actually back to my consistency argument we can actually use this to learn for example we're in California right anybody here from the central part of California of Stockton area okay lay out Laotian Vietnamese Sacramento 50,000 Ukrainians we have refugees in large portions in large community Afghani since in the South Bay area that are already here just in California get rid of the rest of the country right now just talk about California we can go and find out what worked what didn't work what threats exist what threats didn't exist but we don't do that we don't NGOs do but the government doesn't do it and I think that's where that one of the other products of this whole issue is we've got to figure out a consistent plan or existent way to deal with refugees are not going to go away once this serious situation is done ten years now it's going to be someplace else so that's a lay you had this point about the the expectations of refugees once they get to the United States can you address like what are the requirements the benchmarks that they have to do it's not that they come here and they're given you know handouts literally it's they have to repay their ticket first and foremost within 90 days they're required to have work they have all these certain benchmarks they have to meet to meet all of their benefits and within six months the cash assistant is cut and you're facing the barriers of resettling your children in a new school learning the language Rioch wa meeting if you are a surgeon you're gonna be a cab driver now you know you you have the opportunity to work but you don't get to translate all of your skills necessarily the lost of all your family members the trauma so it is a very complex impacted system I've been on the other side as well when having them come here we call it protracted meaning they're in refugee camps five plus years so the uncertainty from arriving to actually in country is very complicated and very difficult yet I I'm happy to report this is an incredibly resilient population that wants to work that wants to integrate that wants to have everything that we have life for their families to move forward to thrive to succeed and so just in a nutshell their process is quite complex you can go to your say your local resettlement agency Catholic Charities volunteer tutors some of the kids they always struggle with math and English and parents are learning if they are not fluent in English as of yet and you get to learn about your resettlement process so wait one second there are a lot of actually churches that that partner with the US government in resettling refugees so for the good Christians out there there's a lot of volunteer opportunities but some and then I just want to address the elephant in the room if we're not talking about refugees here we're not talking about compassion we're talking about Muslims at the end of the day it is people who are afraid of Muslims all right people cut back well well probably all right so Sarah if somebody is following its land that makes him a Muslim so you cannot really say y'okay it cannot really separate them so listen sir say give me give me action I'll make you hear what everyone give me a chance so the thing is you sir said that like while there is not one person that says what Muslim can do that actually occurs in Iran the Ayatollah there's one person everybody for and I don't think that you want that example and and and and and and this and the thing is so there's everything is when you talk the idea is killing all those guys together there are people there are people in Europe and there are people in different parts of the world who condemned what happened infrared radicalization of Islam every single day not every single but like like usual like very very very very common but the thing is the thing is here we already have agreed with you that there is a problem now we want to solve that problem solving the problem of radicalization of Reformation Reformation comes from within religion the Reformation of the Christian faith came from within religion you don't need like a kind of a Martin Luther coming from outside to tell you what to do there are people who are within the faith who are trying to do that and they're being resisted by the authorities by the religious authorities and by and by political authorities so it's not like we trouble with trying we're not right we are trying and the problem is we are facing these very strong authorities mostly it's a political the problem with Islam is not more of a radicalization the problem with the Muslim world is a problem of free speech and secularism when you have free speech and people can speak what they want you will have a market of ideas a market a market of ideas that can counteract these radical ideas now my problem now I don't think like me and Hudson can give you the vibe that we are some of like uber Muslims who are pretty much like defending their faith we who are not defending the faith we are defending people we are worried about people and the problem is again that discrimination does not discriminate because there are people who have been victims of hate crimes there are not even Muslims not Arabs and not Middle Eastern there are Indians there Jewish Arabs there Christian Arabs will be like discriminated against so again sir the problem of Islam is the problem of any other religion people who would change their faith are people at the end of the day and these people need your help and you're not helping when we say let's block them out and and and and one more and one more thing one more thing one more thing because what I really love about American values is the idea of individuality everybody is its own individual so when you come and tell me no sir it's not most of the country who think that about Muslims I agree with you there are some people but III many of them but when I make you I will meet I will actually take your word as an individual I will deal with you as an individual and this is what I am as two guys deal with anybody Muslim non-muslim Christian as an individual this is a core American value deal with them as individuals not as a group not as a follower of a certain faith thank you again we have respected and agree with what you've said I have to go back to you made this thing about the Ayatollah of course you would say that the idea of it is is to get the leaders involved get more of the leaders and leadership of Islamic faith involved the communities I've heard whether it can I ask you something and this is this is an honest question do you believe Sharia is compatible with the US Constitution that's a big question answer that may I answer that yes I want to respond yeah sure - area that we see right now in the mainstream Islam no it is not actually compatible with life but but the thing is but the thing is serve but the thing is Sharia is like any other anything else you can actually have multiple interpretation with it the main interpretation the main interpretation the main interpretation that is actually controlling the mainstream Islam right now is actually controlled by the Wahhabism and what be controlled by the radical Saudi narrative take that out as he calls it as Sharia and the Quran was there in the 50s and the 60s it's the same people and we didn't hear about me let me follow up the circuit again so since you agreed with the Constitution since you agree that the Sharia is not performed in Syria it's not competitive as a matter of fact I would actually update and I said like even in my own Arabic countries in the Egypt and in the air comes a school that there should not be no mention of Sharia in the Constitution that because we need secular exact Constitution and this is what we are fighting for sheree like Islamic sharia should be dealt with like Jewish area or whatever share it is that should only control your own personal life not a life all right grew back where are elements there are elements and there are elements in the Jewish faith that people have actually had bypassed and have evolved if you read the Bible you can kill your wife if she doesn't have sex again people don't do that stop stop punch please let's go next Adam it's yours no I think I think I think they're on to something again but I want to just kind of turn it around a little bit in the sense that I agree if anything's gonna happen you and I have to work together you and you and they you have to work together we go I mean if we're gonna change the world in general whether it be Islam or whether it be just Americans opening their hearts to everybody else we're gonna have to work together and talk you and I as well whatever the only thing I will say on the other stretch around is what you were saying a moment ago kind of don't assume that so many people are against you I know because they may have voted for Trump or not voted for Trump because I meet people all the time that actually you know for whatever reason love Hillary Clinton or love Donald Trump now I have opinion about that but the point is just because they were one way or the other does not mean they believe that all Muslims bad or all Jewish people were bad or whatever so we have to get that past the point the automatic and you guys assume I say you guys because you put yourself together when you said both of you together that you assume that that everybody that there aren't a lot of people out there that do get it I mean I get it like you because I'm not Muslim but I also do get listen we're gonna have to I've been in I've been in Israel and isn't thing it's my wife I'll pass them on I'm done for a while cuz I've talked too much but I'll tell you this was one of the coolest things I have but my first trip to Israel was we have a Palestinian producer we have Israeli producer because in Israel you can't cross over it's a long story I can tell you after the things over with point is I went to both happen to go to back-to-back parties they were the same age both female one party one day what part of the next day it was like my argument of Pakistan on the last panel they are so similar in so many ways going to a Palestinian party in an Israeli party i sat there as an American go on holy crap I'm expecting this like why you know ones pink ones green I mean no they were if I brought them both up here most unless you were from the Middle East most Americans could not tell you which one was which we have better food okay my son talked about because it's very similar I love the example of what you're talking about because very similar to what you even see within Greeks and Turks right and the thing is um Bassam is constantly talking about the individual and I want to talk about the system a little bit because the same people that actually supported Donald Trump for his isolationist policies the fact that he mentioned that the war in Iraq was terrible and we shouldn't have done it in how he railed against it now he railed against Hillary Clinton for being against the war in her act now those same supporters still are very much vocally in favor of increasing the the drone bombing that we're doing eat land and the sanctions that we're putting forward on Iran like trying to escalate tensions in the Middle East to potentially start more ground warfare that is a terrifying thought because I think that it exacerbates the problem because when you have individuals that are struggling to come here and then we're vilifying them and we think that they're some of them might be radicals so we should deny them entry and then on top of that they go back to the same and then their their homes are ravaged by war there's no infrastructure left in these countries I mean how can you not expect them to be radicalized I'm saying it's awful that it's happening it's terrifying create a Caliphate all over the perhaps by the way that you just advocated for a singular force and Isis is literally trying to do that with the Caliphate that's terrifying that's what we're trying I don't you know for words I didn't say singular for the Caliphate is always just get all the sects get all the leaders Arabic Muslim leaders in a room in a conference like this let them fight it out because this is one of them the Arabic the Arab leaders it's in their best interest to use religion to oppress their own peace i George I said forget about sighs Islam yes yes doesn't separate them yes you have to define there better what their abraham lincoln said about ringless lay I have to look at it you have to look at how religion is used in the Middle East even by people who do not pose as religious leaders because many of especially my President Abdel Fattah el-sisi he would say he would actually use religion because if you today go against tradition and try to think and question religion tomorrow you will question his authority so all of them I mean they will today they will not come you know in a room and say like we are going to these are actually the bad guys these are the dictators you really don't need their opinion now I now I want to take one one more thing I want to address the some of the gentlemen here who are calling on the Sharia and how Muslims are hotel and I I I would like to address your fears now for many Muslims Sharia for them is just inheritance eating halal and like how to marry for many they actually use Sharia is a way to kill infidels now the same cherry I it's it's it's a 1400 years old religion the same people the same Sharia were there in the 50s and the 60s and 40s III know that you have read stuff about Syria and many of the stuff that you have read is absolutely true it's horrific but it's not what is written in the scripture it's how you use it and how we interpret it because if you look actually at the shakes and of Egypt in 1914 the ships which are like the priests their wives and their daughters were not even wearing hijab so did religion change or was it corrupted so the thing is we are talking now we are here on the same side many of the people or that Sharia wanted to kill the infidels wanna kill me and people like hassel we are not their friends all right but I want to tell you that do not let this kind of interpretation that tells you that this what defines people it can define a mainstream interpretation which we are fighting but it does not define people okay now sorry time up okay I'm gonna have the last word here so it was very hard to actually get get away from the issue of Islam as since we were talking about radicalism and a lot of perception is that all Muslims are radicals and we have a booth here at 32 and the amount of questions that we were had to address with folks with you know make America great again and you're in my face on all the issues but was what was really shocking and we get these emails all the time that I have to address all of you and this is on social media and I'm gonna take advantage of this is that if you perpetuate the same radical shit as the radical Muslims and promote their theology as truth then you are just as complicit I representing Muslims for progressive values we fight the radicals we are fighting all on human rights issues that are justified in the name of so-called God's law Sharia law which is totally a hundred percent man-made construct so don't fool yourself unless that's what you want to do you want to fool yourself you want to fool your constitute constituency to hate Muslims and what Bassam alluded to is really true there really is a problem of hate towards Muslims in some form it is almost justified but it is not unjustifiable if you're going to be just blankly hating people just for the sake of labels especially when there's no basis especially when we are Muslims are fighting the same fights so get over it we're on the same page we're fighting the same BS we're fighting the same radicalism we're fighting the same for human rights issues so just you know stop glorifying yourself and stop so seriously you're just I think what people want to see and I'm looking at it objectively I'm not a newscaster I'm just an actor I'm looking at it as a human being as a guy looking at the tea leaves in them in America and around the world and been around the world what the West wants to see are you and you and you and you and the rest of you here that are most lemon or Islamic have a you know and you're gonna laugh at this but I haven't seen the Million Man March to Washington DC denouncing denouncing radicalization I have known about why do you why do you want to minimize that there has been marches in London and in Berlin I mean how many more marches can people do I have been marches in Baghdad there have been marches everywhere the thing can I say something most of the fight that we're having with our people is in Arabic that's right all right that's why you don't hear about it all right well well we're hearing about it today this is what we need to know this is what we need to know from the one second because this is a very common thing it's like why don't we hear more about what we do we do sir I swear to you we do we are trying to fight that we try that with where there's a lot of conferences out there there is a lot of marshes out there there are a lot of it because we I'm telling you I had all like hashtag called secularism like and by the way secularism for many urban Muslims is like as synonymous as saying but you didn't hear about it because it's in Arabic because most of the population in the Middle East speaks Arabic I'm not gonna speak to them in English they think of like why don't people get together conferences do not solve anything you go and you you you you you go and you fight with them and you talk to them it's not about like all right you can you can have by the way that conference in Saudi Arabia with Trump went in Saudi Arabia who they have opened a center called at Adel which meaning in the middle or or moderate that was sponsored by Saudi Arabia to counteract radical ideas okay so on the last one I mean it is Ruth Bassam last word I got it so the hypocrisy of American policy foreign policy for me as a progressive Muslim representing Muslims for progressive values that's the problem so if you really want to counter radicalism you've got to talk to your representatives and cut this BS of being allies with Saudi Arabia thank you every time he was sober every time I saw her
