1
00:00:04,420 --> 00:00:06,520
let's do what is recycled back

2
00:00:06,520 --> 00:00:08,920
recyclebank is the largest green

3
00:00:08,920 --> 00:00:10,719

4
00:00:10,719 --> 00:00:13,750
<font color="#CCCCCC">first consumer green company</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and it</font>

5
00:00:13,750 --> 00:00:15,220
can't mean a fascinating way the one

6
00:00:15,220 --> 00:00:16,900
thing I do on the side is where while

7
00:00:16,900 --> 00:00:18,279
all the<font color="#E5E5E5"> West Coast venture capitalists</font>

8
00:00:18,279 --> 00:00:20,140
are adjunct professors at Stanford I've

9
00:00:20,140 --> 00:00:21,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">been able to become an adjunct professor</font>

10
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:23,710
adjunct professor at Columbia Business

11
00:00:23,710 --> 00:00:25,690
School and one of my students fella

12
00:00:25,690 --> 00:00:27,699
named Ron going in you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> rodas report</font>

13
00:00:27,699 --> 00:00:29,020
on this company came to me two<font color="#E5E5E5"> years</font>

14
00:00:29,020 --> 00:00:31,000
after he graduated and said I figured

15
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,619
out<font color="#E5E5E5"> a way to pay people to recycle their</font>

16
00:00:32,619 --> 00:00:35,320
garbage I said that's fascinating it's a

17
00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:36,940
garbage company let me think about he

18
00:00:36,940 --> 00:00:38,379
said<font color="#E5E5E5"> but you understand when I hate</font>

19
00:00:38,379 --> 00:00:40,720
<font color="#CCCCCC">people the throughput of recycling goes</font>

20
00:00:40,720 --> 00:00:43,449
up so much that<font color="#CCCCCC"> the municipalities save</font>

21
00:00:43,449 --> 00:00:45,159
10 to 20<font color="#E5E5E5"> million dollars in landfill</font>

22
00:00:45,159 --> 00:00:46,839
costs<font color="#E5E5E5"> i SAT there and I really thought</font>

23
00:00:46,839 --> 00:00:47,949
about that it's like I said<font color="#E5E5E5"> that that's</font>

24
00:00:47,949 --> 00:00:49,150
kind<font color="#CCCCCC"> of fascinating because what you</font>

25
00:00:49,150 --> 00:00:51,129
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a virtuous circle and those</font>

26
00:00:51,129 --> 00:00:53,229
things<font color="#E5E5E5"> usually don't exist I spent a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> lot</font>

27
00:00:53,229 --> 00:00:54,790
of time trying to<font color="#E5E5E5"> figure</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> out you know</font>

28
00:00:54,790 --> 00:00:56,619
who's losing money when somebody makes

29
00:00:56,619 --> 00:00:58,600
money<font color="#E5E5E5"> almost always somebody is losing</font>

30
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:00,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">money and I came to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> conclusion there</font>

31
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:01,960
was<font color="#E5E5E5"> really the single source landfill</font>

32
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:04,690
owners but most landfills are owned by

33
00:01:04,690 --> 00:01:07,330
haulers so what you have is a way<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

34
00:01:07,330 --> 00:01:09,329
the consumers get paid for doing this

35
00:01:09,329 --> 00:01:12,130
the municipalities save you no

36
00:01:12,130 --> 00:01:14,140
significant money for implementing these

37
00:01:14,140 --> 00:01:16,570
programs the haulers get a competitive

38
00:01:16,570 --> 00:01:18,189
advantage for linking with this and

39
00:01:18,189 --> 00:01:19,180
what's otherwise an extraordinarily

40
00:01:19,180 --> 00:01:21,520
commodity business and the politicians

41
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:23,590
get<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be green and I guess the</font>

42
00:01:23,590 --> 00:01:25,149
fascinating thing is what I saw is the

43
00:01:25,149 --> 00:01:26,920
<font color="#CCCCCC">lower income</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> families love this because</font>

44
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:28,750
they say you know what I get free

45
00:01:28,750 --> 00:01:30,640
groceries right I you know this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font>

46
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:31,899
is a big<font color="#E5E5E5"> deal when I went down</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and did</font>

47
00:01:31,899 --> 00:01:34,119
due diligence i watch the trucks rolling

48
00:01:34,119 --> 00:01:36,100
and people were out protecting their

49
00:01:36,100 --> 00:01:38,049
garbage cans so that nobody<font color="#E5E5E5"> would steal</font>

50
00:01:38,049 --> 00:01:39,850
the recyclable material because<font color="#CCCCCC"> it was a</font>

51
00:01:39,850 --> 00:01:41,649
significant amount of money and the

52
00:01:41,649 --> 00:01:43,149
wealthier neighborhoods it's all about

53
00:01:43,149 --> 00:01:44,799
you know either i can say i don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

54
00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:46,630
free starbucks this month or<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm going</font>

55
00:01:46,630 --> 00:01:48,009
to donate it to my local school so it's

56
00:01:48,009 --> 00:01:50,979
been absolutely fascinating company and

57
00:01:50,979 --> 00:01:52,719
it's just taken off<font color="#CCCCCC"> in a variety of ways</font>

58
00:01:52,719 --> 00:01:54,520
and what I'm proudest of is that it's a

59
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:56,319
new york company<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's great and and</font>

60
00:01:56,319 --> 00:01:58,569
<font color="#E5E5E5">clearly that is what has</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to happen</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font>

61
00:01:58,569 --> 00:02:01,179
green anything to<font color="#CCCCCC"> take hold it's got to</font>

62
00:02:01,179 --> 00:02:03,159
become an actual economic incentive as

63
00:02:03,159 --> 00:02:05,049
opposed to say telling your friends that

64
00:02:05,049 --> 00:02:06,460
you're being green or<font color="#CCCCCC"> what-have-you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font>

65
00:02:06,460 --> 00:02:08,169
talk a little bit more<font color="#CCCCCC"> about exactly how</font>

00:02:08,169 --> 00:02:09,970
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> company does it I mean so where is</font>

67
00:02:09,970 --> 00:02:11,920
the money coming from sure what they do

68
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:13,989
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> they put an RFID tag on each of the</font>

69
00:02:13,989 --> 00:02:15,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">garbage bins and</font>

70
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:16,630
the truck comes around the trucks are

art p<font color="#CCCCCC"> fridge community so truck rolls</font>

73
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:22,090

will throw it into the truck it

automatically reach the<font color="#CCCCCC"> RFID tag ways it</font>

77

know amazon starbucks etc and it's just

82
00:02:37,870 --> 00:02:39,280
confessing because what you said is

83
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:41,110
particularly true everybody wants to be

84
00:02:41,110 --> 00:02:43,360
green<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay everybody wants to do the</font>

85
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:46,090
<font color="#CCCCCC">right thing but it's amazing how many</font>

more<font color="#CCCCCC"> people do it when you get paid and</font>

90
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:56,260
fifty dollars a month which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

91
00:02:56,260 --> 00:02:57,640
significant it's enough to move the

92
00:02:57,640 --> 00:02:59,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">needle right I looked at on so many</font>

98

the needle forty to fifty dollars a

99
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:11,110
month moves the needle for most families

100
00:03:11,110 --> 00:03:12,820
and most people<font color="#E5E5E5"> how big</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is the company</font>

101
00:03:12,820 --> 00:03:15,670

102
00:03:15,670 --> 00:03:17,740
the company<font color="#E5E5E5"> can be a multi-billion</font>

103

119
00:03:50,950 --> 00:03:53,200
seems to be a<font color="#E5E5E5"> rocket ship in many ways</font>

120
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:55,840
because it's unusual everybody

121
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:57,400
understands it everybody's grandmother

00:04:17,829 --> 00:00:00,000
it<font color="#CCCCCC"> makes sense and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it works</font>
