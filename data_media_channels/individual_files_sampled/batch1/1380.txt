films by women and about women have the starring role the 17th Tribeca Film Festival which opened with love Gilda at the time when I thought that all I wanted to do was work a tribute to comedienne and Saturday Night Live star Gilda Radner directed by Lisa da Pulido but one of the things interesting about the festival this year is that we really tried to have 50/50 parity so 46 percent of our narrative films are directed by women and you get a different perspective with strong women characters watch his synthetic facial muscles and his body posture her like Zoe this year's centerpiece film a sci-fi romance about finding love in a world of technological artifice that also has an of the moment feel may be different come forward with nearly 100 feature films plus shorts TV and online works not to mention the live music and artist talks there's a little something for everyone at Tribeca this is an international festival but it gets its name from its New York neighborhood as well as a spirit of activism I don't know what kind of tipping point we're at the work of the New York Times grappling with how to cover an adversarial president is featured in the closing night documentary called the Fourth Estate while two shorts surviving theater 9 and notes from Dunblane give voice to the survivors of mass shootings amid the country's gun control debate continuing the festival's tradition of socially relevant selections New York itself is gritty the tradition of filmmaking and creative people here is certainly gritty and so I think you could see some of that character in the programming and some of the kinds of people that the festival attracts even international issues come with New York perspective like the short film Salaam about a Syrian Palestinian woman who drives the city streets for a living while awaiting life-or-death news from home it's a story about an immigrant made by an immigrant he Tribeca was the absolute perfect premier venue for my film because this is a New York film it's a you know celebrating all of the different cultures that we have in New York it's celebrating the fact that this is a liberal city the festival-goers Tribeca provides a window on the world and the cutting edge of culture with plenty of New York attitude Kristen Cellini al Jazeera New York
