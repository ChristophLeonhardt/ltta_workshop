1
00:00:01,815 --> 00:00:08,688
WATTERS, THIS IS "THE FIVE."

2
00:00:08,688 --> 00:00:10,890
A MAJOR BREAKTHROUGH WITH NORTH

3
00:00:10,890 --> 00:00:12,058
KOREA AFTER HISTORIC MEETING

4
00:00:12,058 --> 00:00:13,893
INSIDE THE OVAL OFFICE.

5
00:00:13,893 --> 00:00:15,895
PRESIDENT TRUMP IS SAYING HE'LL

6
00:00:15,895 --> 00:00:16,896
SIT DOWN WITH KIM JONG-UN IN

7
00:00:16,896 --> 00:00:19,833
SINGAPORE.

8
00:00:19,833 --> 00:00:21,034
>> President Trump: WE'LL BE

9
00:00:21,034 --> 00:00:21,701
MEETING ON JUNE 12, IN

10
00:00:21,701 --> 00:00:22,869
SINGAPORE.

11
00:00:22,869 --> 00:00:26,206
I THINK IT'LL BE A PROCESS.

12
00:00:26,206 --> 00:00:26,906
I NEVER SAID IT GOES IN ONE

13
00:00:26,906 --> 00:00:27,740
MEETING.

14
00:00:27,740 --> 00:00:29,309
I THINK IT WILL BE A PROCESS.

15
00:00:29,309 --> 00:00:31,077
BUT THE RELATIONSHIPS ARE

16
00:00:31,077 --> 00:00:32,512
BUILDING AND THAT'S POSITIVE.

17
00:00:32,512 --> 00:00:38,318
WE TALKED ABOUT ENDING THE WAR.

18
00:00:38,318 --> 00:00:40,353
THIS WAR HAS TO BE THE LONGEST

19
00:00:40,353 --> 00:00:41,454
WAR, ALMOST 70 YEARS.

20
00:00:41,454 --> 00:00:43,323
CAN YOU BELIEVE WE'RE TALKING

21
00:00:43,323 --> 00:00:44,924
ABOUT THE ENDING OF THE KOREAN

22
00:00:44,924 --> 00:00:45,859
WAR?

23
00:00:45,859 --> 00:00:49,429
>> THE ANNOUNCEMENT COMING AFTER

24
00:00:49,429 --> 00:00:51,030
TALKING WITH VICE CHAIRMAN KIM

25
00:00:51,030 --> 00:00:53,233
YONG CHOI AFTER OVER AN HOUR.

26
00:00:53,233 --> 00:00:54,834
PRESIDENT TRUMP SURPRISING SOME

27
00:00:54,834 --> 00:00:56,736
WHEN ASKED ABOUT RECEIVING A

28
00:00:56,736 --> 00:00:58,171
LETTER FROM KIM JONG-UN.

29
00:00:58,171 --> 00:00:58,872
>> I HAVEN'T SEEN THE LETTER

30
00:00:58,872 --> 00:00:59,672
YET.

31
00:00:59,672 --> 00:01:00,373
I PURPOSELY DIDN'T OPEN THE

32
00:01:00,373 --> 00:01:01,007
LETTER.

33
00:01:01,007 --> 00:01:02,375
I HAVEN'T OPENED IT.

34
00:01:02,375 --> 00:01:03,243
I DIDN'T OPEN IT IN FRONT OF THE

35
00:01:03,243 --> 00:01:05,311
DIRECTOR.

36
00:01:05,311 --> 00:01:07,180
I SAID WOULD YOU WANT ME TO OPEN

37
00:01:07,180 --> 00:01:07,814
IT?

38
00:01:07,814 --> 00:01:09,315
HE SAID YOU CAN READ IT LATER.

39
00:01:09,315 --> 00:01:10,283
I MAY BE IN FOR A BIG SURPRISE,

40
00:01:10,283 --> 00:01:13,119
FOLKS.

41
00:01:13,119 --> 00:01:14,153
>> THE PRESIDENT HAS SINCE READ

42
00:01:14,153 --> 00:01:15,622
THE LETTER, I DON'T KNOW IF IT

43
00:01:15,622 --> 00:01:16,956
WAS A BIG SURPRISE, BUT THAT

44
00:01:16,956 --> 00:01:18,358
HAPPENED DURING THE DAILY

45
00:01:18,358 --> 00:01:19,726
BRIEFING, MY FAVORITE PART, WHEN

46
00:01:19,726 --> 00:01:21,060
HE MADE THAT JOKE.

47
00:01:21,060 --> 00:01:23,229
AN AMAZING DAY, I THINK THAT THE

48
00:01:23,229 --> 00:01:25,298
BIG NEWS KIMBERLY IS THAT, YES,

49
00:01:25,298 --> 00:01:27,400
OF COURSE THE SUMMIT IS A GO, AT

50
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:28,601
LEAST TODAY, WE'LL SEE HOW THAT

51
00:01:28,601 --> 00:01:31,170
GOES NEXT WEEK.

52
00:01:31,170 --> 00:01:33,273
BUT ALSO, THE SOUTH KOREANS HAVE

53
00:01:33,273 --> 00:01:35,074
BEEN PUSHING FOR THIS

54
00:01:35,074 --> 00:01:36,209
POSSIBILITY OF SIGNING AN END TO

55
00:01:36,209 --> 00:01:37,710
THE KOREAN WAR.

56
00:01:37,710 --> 00:01:39,312
AND THE PRESIDENT INDICATING

57
00:01:39,312 --> 00:01:41,881
THAT THAT IS LIKELY TO BE AN

58
00:01:41,881 --> 00:01:43,683
OUTCOME OF THAT FIRST MEETING.

59
00:01:43,683 --> 00:01:45,618
IT'S NOT NECESSARILY THE FULL

60
00:01:45,618 --> 00:01:48,154
deNUCLEARIZATION THAT HE WANTS,

61
00:01:48,154 --> 00:01:50,456
BUT THAT IS ONE OF THE GO-TOS

62
00:01:50,456 --> 00:01:51,925
FOR THE SOUTH KOREANS.

63
00:01:51,925 --> 00:01:55,028
BY THE NORTH KOREANS AS WELL.

64
00:01:55,028 --> 00:01:57,030
>> I THINK IS HISTORIC IN TERMS

65
00:01:57,030 --> 00:01:58,331
OF WHAT HAS BEEN ACCOMPLISHED SO

66
00:01:58,331 --> 00:01:58,598
FAR.

67
00:01:58,598 --> 00:01:59,832
NO OTHER PRESIDENCY HAS BEEN

68
00:01:59,832 --> 00:02:01,567
ABLE TO GET THE BALL SO FAR DOWN

69
00:02:01,567 --> 00:02:02,535
IN THE COURT TO BE ABLE TO DO

70
00:02:02,535 --> 00:02:05,205
SOMETHING LIKE THIS.

71
00:02:05,205 --> 00:02:09,241
IN TERMS OF BROKERING A PEACE

72
00:02:09,241 --> 00:02:11,478
AGREEMENT, DENUCLEARIZATION,

73
00:02:11,478 --> 00:02:13,179
SAYING WE'RE GOING TO DO THIS

74
00:02:13,179 --> 00:02:13,513
SUMMIT.

75
00:02:13,513 --> 00:02:14,647
THIS IS SOMETHING THAT EVERYBODY

76
00:02:14,647 --> 00:02:15,482
SHOULD BE VERY EXCITED ABOUT

77
00:02:15,482 --> 00:02:17,050
INTERNATIONALLY.

78
00:02:17,050 --> 00:02:19,752
IT BRINGS THE CHANCE AND THE

79
00:02:19,752 --> 00:02:20,753
OPPORTUNITY FOR PEACE AND

80
00:02:20,753 --> 00:02:23,289
STABILITY IN THE REGION THAT'S

81
00:02:23,289 --> 00:02:24,724
BEEN SO GEOPOLITICALLY FRAUGHT

82
00:02:24,724 --> 00:02:26,659
WITH DANGER, THE REGIME.

83
00:02:26,659 --> 00:02:29,496
WHAT WE SEE IS HE'S ABLE TO

84
00:02:29,496 --> 00:02:31,331
BRING KIM JONG-UN TO THE TABLE

85
00:02:31,331 --> 00:02:33,233
AND TO HIS KNEES, ESSENTIALLY.

86
00:02:33,233 --> 00:02:35,402
HIS ECONOMY IS ON THE BRING OF

87
00:02:35,535 --> 00:02:36,569
HE HAS REALLY NO CHOICE BUT TO

88
00:02:36,569 --> 00:02:38,705
COME TO THE TABLE.

89
00:02:38,705 --> 00:02:39,939
WHAT PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS DONE

90
00:02:39,939 --> 00:02:42,475
WITH TARIFFS, PUTTING PRESSURE,

91
00:02:42,475 --> 00:02:43,309
APPLYING PRESSURE WITH THE

92
00:02:43,309 --> 00:02:44,577
CHINESE, WHAT HE'S DONE IN TERMS

93
00:02:44,577 --> 00:02:46,513
OF HIS OUTREACH AND RELATIONSHIP

94
00:02:46,513 --> 00:02:48,782
WITH SOUTH KOREA AS WELL HAS ALL

95
00:02:48,782 --> 00:02:51,317
PUT THIS INTO MOTION.

96
00:02:51,317 --> 00:02:52,252
RELATIVELY QUICK PERIOD OF TIME

97
00:02:52,252 --> 00:02:54,421
EARLY IN HIS PRESIDENCY.

98
00:02:54,421 --> 00:02:56,122
I THINK IT'S MOST YOU A SPACIOUS

99
00:02:56,122 --> 00:02:58,491
AND FAVORABLE FOR THE UNITED

100
00:02:58,491 --> 00:03:00,126
STATES AND FOR NORTH AND SOUTH

101
00:03:00,126 --> 00:03:00,460
KOREA.

102
00:03:00,460 --> 00:03:01,127
>> YOU MEANT SANCTIONS NOT

103
00:03:01,127 --> 00:03:02,896
TARIFFS.

104
00:03:02,896 --> 00:03:04,264
THE PRESIDENT SAID HE HAD OVER.

105
00:03:04,264 --> 00:03:05,932
00 ADDITIONAL SANCTIONS THAT HE

106
00:03:05,932 --> 00:03:08,334
WAS READY TO PUT ON.

107
00:03:08,334 --> 00:03:10,370
AND THE NORTH KOREANS KNEW ABOUT

108
00:03:10,370 --> 00:03:12,072
THAT, IN THE MEETING THE

109
00:03:12,072 --> 00:03:12,839
PRESIDENT SAID, OKAY, I WON'T DO

110
00:03:12,839 --> 00:03:14,674
IT.

111
00:03:14,674 --> 00:03:15,909
AT LEAST NOT AT THIS MOMENT.

112
00:03:15,909 --> 00:03:17,477
>> IF HE DOESN'T LIKE WHAT HE

113
00:03:17,477 --> 00:03:18,812
SEE WHEN IS HE OPENS THE LETTER,

114
00:03:18,812 --> 00:03:19,679
SLAP A FEW MORE SANCTIONS BACK

115
00:03:19,679 --> 00:03:22,916
ON.

116
00:03:22,916 --> 00:03:25,151
I WAS DOWNSTAIRS EARLIER AND

117
00:03:25,151 --> 00:03:28,021
THEY HAVE TO HAVE THE MSNBC

118
00:03:28,021 --> 00:03:29,089
CHANNEL, ON IT'S RIGHT UNDER

119
00:03:29,089 --> 00:03:30,857
ROCK CENTER, I WAS FORCED TO

120
00:03:30,857 --> 00:03:32,358
WATCH THEM COVER THIS --

121
00:03:32,358 --> 00:03:33,059
>> YOU DON'T HAVE TO EXPLAIN

122
00:03:33,059 --> 00:03:33,793
THIS.

123
00:03:33,793 --> 00:03:34,594
WE WON'T JUDGE YOU.

124
00:03:34,594 --> 00:03:35,361
>> I THOUGHT I NEEDED TO MAKE IT

125
00:03:35,361 --> 00:03:37,330
CLEAR.

126
00:03:37,330 --> 00:03:37,697
[LAUGHING]

127
00:03:37,697 --> 00:03:39,532
I WASN'T WATCHING IT ON PURPOSE.

128
00:03:39,532 --> 00:03:41,434
HE'S TALKING ABOUT BRINGING,

129
00:03:41,434 --> 00:03:43,136
LIKE KIMBERLY SAID, THE TWO

130
00:03:43,136 --> 00:03:43,903
SIDES TOGETHER AND ENDING A WAR

131
00:03:43,903 --> 00:03:45,205
THAT'S GONE ON.

132
00:03:45,205 --> 00:03:47,240
WE'RE STILL AT WAR, TECHNICALLY,

133
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:48,007
THAT'S BEEN GOING ON FOR

134
00:03:48,007 --> 00:03:50,143
DECADES.

135
00:03:50,143 --> 00:03:51,778
AND THE ANCHORS COME OUT AND

136
00:03:51,778 --> 00:03:52,679
THEY CRITICIZE HIM --

137
00:03:52,679 --> 00:03:53,079
>> REALLY?

138
00:03:53,079 --> 00:03:54,380
>> I SAW THAT.

139
00:03:54,380 --> 00:03:56,416
>> GOING BACK AND FORTH ON THE

140
00:03:56,416 --> 00:03:57,517
SINGAPORE SUM INTEREST FOR

141
00:03:57,517 --> 00:03:58,618
CANCELLING IT, GOING BACK, ON

142
00:03:58,618 --> 00:04:00,420
THEN SAYING WHAT A HYPOCRITE, HE

143
00:04:00,420 --> 00:04:01,755
GETS OUT OF THE IRAN DEAL, THEN

144
00:04:01,755 --> 00:04:02,889
WANTS TO MAKE A DEAL WITH NORTH

145
00:04:02,889 --> 00:04:03,923
KOREA.

146
00:04:03,923 --> 00:04:06,760
I'M THINKING TO MYSELF, IF THIS

147
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:08,395
WAS PRESIDENT OBAMA, AND THIS

148
00:04:08,395 --> 00:04:10,296
WAS GOING ALONG THE WAY IT'S

149
00:04:10,296 --> 00:04:12,365
GOING ALONG UNDER PRESIDENT

150
00:04:12,365 --> 00:04:13,066
TRUMP, HE WOULD BE HAILED.

151
00:04:13,066 --> 00:04:13,867
>> NO KIDDING.

152
00:04:13,867 --> 00:04:15,201
>> THE GUY IN THE WHITE HOUSE

153
00:04:15,201 --> 00:04:17,870
TODAY, IT'S AMAZING THEY WOULD

154
00:04:17,870 --> 00:04:19,572
BRING A GUY WHO RESPONSIBLE FOR

155
00:04:19,572 --> 00:04:21,774
HACKING SONY, HACKING ON

156
00:04:21,774 --> 00:04:23,777
PEOPLE'S LIMBS, DOING SOME OF

157
00:04:23,777 --> 00:04:25,378
THE MOST ATROCIOUS THINGS TO

158
00:04:25,378 --> 00:04:26,679
HUMAN BEINGS IN THE WORLD, ONE

159
00:04:26,679 --> 00:04:29,149
OF THE MOST BRUTAL PEEP AIM

160
00:04:29,149 --> 00:04:29,883
ROUND, INTO THE WHITE HOUSE,

161
00:04:29,883 --> 00:04:31,117
INTO THE OVAL OFFICE, NOT JUST

162
00:04:31,117 --> 00:04:32,585
FOR HANDING OFF.

163
00:04:32,585 --> 00:04:34,821
LETTER BUT THEN TO SIT AND

164
00:04:34,821 --> 00:04:35,855
DISCUSS THINGS, BUT THE FACT

165
00:04:35,855 --> 00:04:39,592
THAT YOU ARE FORCED TO DEAL WITH

166
00:04:39,592 --> 00:04:41,561
SAVAGE PEOPLE IN THIS WORLD,

167
00:04:41,561 --> 00:04:43,596
SAYS A LOT ABOUT OUR COUNTRY AND

168
00:04:43,596 --> 00:04:45,165
WHAT WE'RE WILLING TO DO IN

169
00:04:45,165 --> 00:04:46,699
ORDER TO ACHIEVE PEACE.

170
00:04:46,699 --> 00:04:48,301
CHINA IS AS YOU'VE BEEN SAYING,

171
00:04:48,301 --> 00:04:50,703
PRETTY INTEGRAL IN THIS.

172
00:04:50,703 --> 00:04:52,138
THEY DON'T NECESSARILY WANT TO

173
00:04:52,138 --> 00:04:54,073
SEE NORTH KOREA deFANGED.

174
00:04:54,073 --> 00:04:56,576
THEY'RE WORRIED ABOUT A CRISIS

175
00:04:56,576 --> 00:04:58,077
WITH MIGRANTS FLOWING ACROSS.

176
00:04:58,077 --> 00:04:59,679
AND LET'S JUST SAY KOREA COMES

177
00:04:59,679 --> 00:05:01,781
TOGETHER AS ONE, EVENTUALLY A

178
00:05:01,781 --> 00:05:02,482
POWERHOUSE, THEN JAPAN RIGHT

179
00:05:02,482 --> 00:05:04,184
THERE.

180
00:05:04,184 --> 00:05:04,951
AND THEIR ALLIANCE WITH THE

181
00:05:04,951 --> 00:05:06,352
UNITED STATES.

182
00:05:06,352 --> 00:05:07,954
YOU HAVE A PRETTY BOLD KIND OF

183
00:05:07,954 --> 00:05:10,290
WESTERN ORIENTED ALLIANCE, RIGHT

184
00:05:10,290 --> 00:05:11,891
ON CHINA'S DOORSTEP.

185
00:05:11,891 --> 00:05:13,893
THEY MIGHT NOT LIKE THAT.

186
00:05:13,893 --> 00:05:15,128
WE'LL JUST CONTINUE TO SEE HOW

187
00:05:15,128 --> 00:05:16,796
CHINA REACTS.

188
00:05:16,796 --> 00:05:17,063
.

189
00:05:17,063 --> 00:05:19,632
THE PRESIDENT SAID, MY FAVORITE

190
00:05:19,632 --> 00:05:21,100
LINE, WE'LL SEE WHAT HAPPENS, HE

191
00:05:21,100 --> 00:05:24,103
WENT A LITTLE BIT MORE EMPHATIC

192
00:05:24,237 --> 00:05:26,039
WILL NOT BE THE ONLY MEETING,

193
00:05:26,039 --> 00:05:27,740
THAT IT'S NOT GOING TO BE WHERE

194
00:05:27,740 --> 00:05:28,975
YOU FINISH THE WHOLE DEAL.

195
00:05:28,975 --> 00:05:30,977
THE OTHER THING, HE DID, I DON'T

196
00:05:30,977 --> 00:05:32,479
KNOW IF WE HAVE THE VIDEO, IF

197
00:05:32,479 --> 00:05:35,582
YOU CAN PULL IT UP, HE NOT ONLY

198
00:05:35,582 --> 00:05:37,116
DID HE HAVE AN HOUR-LONG MEETING

199
00:05:37,116 --> 00:05:39,519
BUT HE DID A PERSONAL DIPLOMACY

200
00:05:39,519 --> 00:05:40,920
AND WALKED THEM TO THEIR CARS.

201
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:42,689
A HUGE SIGN OF RESPECT.

202
00:05:42,689 --> 00:05:44,991
HE TOOK THAT, LIKE SORT OF GROUP

203
00:05:44,991 --> 00:05:45,892
PICTURE THAT THEY COULD BE

204
00:05:45,892 --> 00:05:47,260
SHOWING BACK IN NORTH KOREA.

205
00:05:47,260 --> 00:05:48,995
>> WELL, TWO POINTS.

206
00:05:48,995 --> 00:05:50,164
ONE, HE KEPT SAYING AGAIN AND

207
00:05:50,164 --> 00:05:51,398
AGAIN IT'S PROCESS.

208
00:05:51,398 --> 00:05:54,568
THIS IS ALWAYS A PROCESS.

209
00:05:54,702 --> 00:05:57,104
IS A DEVELOPER FROM QUEENS NOT A

210
00:05:57,104 --> 00:05:59,273
PROFESSOR FROM COLUMBIA.

211
00:05:59,273 --> 00:06:00,374
HE DOES THINGS LIKE A DEVELOPER

212
00:06:00,374 --> 00:06:02,643
FROM QUEENS.

213
00:06:02,643 --> 00:06:06,413
MEANING, IT'S ABOUT RESPECT AND

214
00:06:06,413 --> 00:06:07,047
RECIPROCITY, SERVICING A

215
00:06:07,047 --> 00:06:07,781
CLIENTD.

216
00:06:07,781 --> 00:06:09,416
SO -- A CLIENT.

217
00:06:09,416 --> 00:06:12,052
YOU KAEFL RELATIONSHIP WITH YOUR

218
00:06:12,052 --> 00:06:13,520
CLIENT, YOU MAKE THEM FEEL GOOD,

219
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:15,289
YOU WAVE THE CARROT, YOU GOT THE

220
00:06:15,289 --> 00:06:17,224
STICK BUT YOU WAVE THE CARROT.

221
00:06:17,224 --> 00:06:20,227
THE TONE HAS TO REFLECT WIN-WIN.

222
00:06:20,227 --> 00:06:21,895
IT'S LIKE YOU AND YOU I ARE BOTH

223
00:06:21,895 --> 00:06:22,596
GOING TO GET SOMETHING OUT OF

224
00:06:22,596 --> 00:06:23,897
THIS.

225
00:06:23,897 --> 00:06:25,933
A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE CRITICAL,

226
00:06:25,933 --> 00:06:27,935
YOU'RE DOING A WIN HIVE WIN WITH

227
00:06:27,935 --> 00:06:29,303
A HEARTLESS KILLER.

228
00:06:29,303 --> 00:06:33,574
HE'S A DEVELOPER FROM QUEENS,

229
00:06:33,574 --> 00:06:35,709
HE'S DEALT WITH WORSE.

230
00:06:35,709 --> 00:06:36,076
[LAUGHING]

231
00:06:36,076 --> 00:06:37,378
THE OMGSS THAT YOU HAVE, OKAY,

232
00:06:37,378 --> 00:06:39,079
YOU GOT TO MEET WITH DR. EVIL

233
00:06:39,079 --> 00:06:40,547
BUT THE OTHER OPTION IF YOU

234
00:06:40,547 --> 00:06:42,416
DON'T, THAT MEANS WAR OR

235
00:06:42,416 --> 00:06:43,951
STARVATION F YOU'RE AGAINST THIS

236
00:06:43,951 --> 00:06:44,852
MEETING, THEN ARE YOU SAYING

237
00:06:44,852 --> 00:06:47,287
MAYBE WE STARVE THESE PEOPLE TO

238
00:06:47,287 --> 00:06:49,423
DEATH, 25 MILLION PEOPLE THROUGH

239
00:06:49,423 --> 00:06:50,958
SANCTIONS AND WHAT NOT.

240
00:06:50,958 --> 00:06:51,658
IF YOU ACTUALLY TRY SOMETHING

241
00:06:51,658 --> 00:06:52,960
NEW.

242
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:54,928
THAT'S WHY THIS IS A

243
00:06:54,928 --> 00:06:56,663
BREAKTHROUGH, WAS YOU HAVE A

244
00:06:56,663 --> 00:06:57,398
DEVELOPER FROM QUEENS WHO SAID

245
00:06:57,398 --> 00:06:58,365
WHY NOT.

246
00:06:58,365 --> 00:07:02,269
LET'S SEE WHAT HAPPENS.

247
00:07:02,269 --> 00:07:03,704
AND EVERYBODY WHO IS FREAKING

248
00:07:03,704 --> 00:07:05,639
OUT ABOUT THAT MIGHT WANT TO

249
00:07:05,639 --> 00:07:06,440
WAIT AND SEE WHAT HAPPENS.

250
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:07,508
>> I DON'T UNDERSTAND THE

251
00:07:07,508 --> 00:07:11,145
CRITICISM TODAY.

252
00:07:11,145 --> 00:07:12,479
ESPECIALLY TODAY OF ALL DAYS

253
00:07:12,479 --> 00:07:14,114
WHERE IT WAS ALL OF THE

254
00:07:14,114 --> 00:07:17,184
DIPLOMACY IN ONE, BUT, GERALDO,

255
00:07:17,184 --> 00:07:18,919
YOU HAVE A PERSPECTIVE FROM

256
00:07:18,919 --> 00:07:20,421
HAVING KWOVERD THE CONFLICT IN

257
00:07:20,421 --> 00:07:21,455
KOREA OVER THE YEARS AND YOU

258
00:07:21,455 --> 00:07:23,057
SAID WERE YOU THERE IN --

259
00:07:23,057 --> 00:07:25,993
>> IN THE '80s, A COUPLE OF

260
00:07:25,993 --> 00:07:26,293
TIMES.

261
00:07:26,293 --> 00:07:28,128
TO JESSE'S POINT, YOU MAKE PEACE

262
00:07:28,128 --> 00:07:29,830
WITH YOUR ENEMIES, YOU DON'T

263
00:07:29,830 --> 00:07:31,465
MAKE PEACE WITH YOUR FRIENDS.

264
00:07:31,465 --> 00:07:33,100
YOU HOLD YOUR NOSE AND YOU GO IN

265
00:07:33,100 --> 00:07:35,469
THERE AND YOU KNOW, PLENTY OF,

266
00:07:35,469 --> 00:07:38,072
IN WAR TIME, PLENTY OF, YOU

267
00:07:38,072 --> 00:07:38,839
KNOW, CRIMINAL ALLEGATIONS TO GO

268
00:07:38,839 --> 00:07:41,041
AROUND.

269
00:07:41,041 --> 00:07:42,943
BUT WATCHING DANA'S EXCELLENT

270
00:07:42,943 --> 00:07:45,345
PROGRAM AT 2:00, THAT LINE

271
00:07:45,345 --> 00:07:46,880
REALLY STUCK IN MY HEAD, CAN YOU

272
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:47,781
BELIEVE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT

273
00:07:47,781 --> 00:07:49,083
ENDING THE KOREAN WAR.

274
00:07:49,083 --> 00:07:50,451
CAN YOU BELIEVE WE'RE TALKING

275
00:07:50,451 --> 00:07:52,386
ABOUT ENDING THE KOREAN WAR.

276
00:07:52,386 --> 00:07:54,321
deNUCLEARIZATION, ALL OF THIS,

277
00:07:54,321 --> 00:07:55,923
THE NUANCE --

278
00:07:55,923 --> 00:07:57,658
>> HOW MANY PEOPLE IN AMERICA,

279
00:07:57,658 --> 00:08:01,562
IT'S BEEN A PART OF THAT.

280
00:08:01,562 --> 00:08:03,864
SERVED IN KOREA, BEEN AT THE

281
00:08:03,864 --> 00:08:04,865
DMZ, I MEAN --

282
00:08:04,865 --> 00:08:06,733
>> VIRTUALLY EVERYONE.

283
00:08:06,733 --> 00:08:07,367
>> SEVERAL GENERATIONS OF

284
00:08:07,367 --> 00:08:08,535
AMERICANS.

285
00:08:08,535 --> 00:08:09,703
>> WHAT IF THEY UNITE --

286
00:08:09,703 --> 00:08:11,071
>> THEY WON'T.

287
00:08:11,071 --> 00:08:12,873
>> I WAS SAYING, ARE SAYING WHAT

288
00:08:12,873 --> 00:08:14,942
A GREAT THING IT IS TO TALK B

289
00:08:14,942 --> 00:08:16,443
BUT SAY IT WON'T HAPPEN.

290
00:08:16,443 --> 00:08:18,445
>> TALK ABOUT UNIFICATION, I'M

291
00:08:18,445 --> 00:08:19,980
TALKING ABOUT A PEACE TREATY

292
00:08:19,980 --> 00:08:20,714
BETWEEN THE UNITED STATES, THE

293
00:08:20,714 --> 00:08:25,752
UNITED NATIONS.

294
00:08:25,752 --> 00:08:27,554
>> DON'T GO NUCLEAR.

295
00:08:27,554 --> 00:08:30,457
I DON'T SEE THAT HAPPENING.

296
00:08:30,457 --> 00:08:32,626
WHERE IS THE EXAMPLE OF THAT

297
00:08:32,626 --> 00:08:35,129
TODAY.

298
00:08:35,129 --> 00:08:37,131
THE SIN TRIF GAL FORCE KEEPS

299
00:08:37,131 --> 00:08:40,634
COMPANIES SEPARATE.

300
00:08:40,634 --> 00:08:43,736
>> THEY'RE UNITED, THEIR

301
00:08:43,736 --> 00:08:46,340
ECONOMIES MIGHT BE MUCH MORE IN

302
00:08:46,340 --> 00:08:51,044
SYNC.

303
00:08:51,044 --> 00:08:52,780
SECTARIAN DICTATORSHIP, PEOPLE

304
00:08:52,780 --> 00:08:55,015
GET CELL PHONES, AS THEY GET THE

305
00:08:55,015 --> 00:08:56,250
SATELLITE TV, I THINK IT WILL

306
00:08:56,250 --> 00:08:56,984
HAVE A MODIFYING EFFECT ON THE

307
00:08:56,984 --> 00:08:58,385
COUNTRY.

308
00:08:58,385 --> 00:09:04,591
BUT, I MEAN, TO ME RECORD LOW,

309
00:09:04,591 --> 00:09:06,560
UNEMPLOYMENT FOR BLACK PEOPLE

310
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:15,469
FOR HISPANIC, WOMEN.

311
00:09:15,469 --> 00:09:17,704
THIS IS THE BEST DAY OF THE

312
00:09:17,704 --> 00:09:18,472
TRUMP PRESIDENCY.

313
00:09:18,472 --> 00:09:20,107
>> THE WAY HE APPLIES PRESSURE

314
00:09:20,107 --> 00:09:25,212
ACROSS ALL DIFFERENT FRONTS.

315
00:09:25,212 --> 00:09:26,447
TO BE ABLE TO GET THEM TO COME

316
00:09:26,447 --> 00:09:28,248
TO THE TABLE TO SUPPORT IT.

317
00:09:28,248 --> 00:09:29,216
THEY SUPPORT THE NORTH KOREAN

318
00:09:29,216 --> 00:09:32,886
REGIME.

319
00:09:32,886 --> 00:09:33,620
OTHERWISE THEY WOULDN'T HAVE

320
00:09:33,620 --> 00:09:37,691
BEEN MOTIVATED.

321
00:09:37,691 --> 00:09:40,060
THEY ARE ON THEIR KNEES,

322
00:09:40,060 --> 00:09:41,462
STARVATION NATION, AND KIM LAST

323
00:09:41,462 --> 00:09:42,763
YEAR MADE A PROMISE TO HIS

324
00:09:42,763 --> 00:09:44,765
PEOPLE AND SAID WE'RE GOING TO

325
00:09:44,765 --> 00:09:46,166
BRING YOU OUT OF THE DESPICABLE

326
00:09:46,166 --> 00:09:48,969
HOLE YOU'RE IN.

327
00:09:48,969 --> 00:09:50,904
I PROMISE GROWTH, BETTER

328
00:09:50,904 --> 00:09:52,372
LIFESTYLE, STANDARD OF LIVING.

329
00:09:52,372 --> 00:09:54,708
HE HASN'T BEEN ABLE TO DELIVER.

330
00:09:54,708 --> 00:09:56,143
SINCE HE MADE THAT PROM WIS THE

331
00:09:56,143 --> 00:09:56,810
SANCTIONS, THINGS OF GOTTEN

332
00:09:56,810 --> 00:09:57,644
WORSE.

333
00:09:57,644 --> 00:09:59,546
HE IS DIEING TO BRING HIS

334
00:09:59,546 --> 00:10:01,949
COUNTRY INTO THE 21st CENTURY.

335
00:10:01,949 --> 00:10:03,617
HE SEES THE PATHWAY FORWARD WITH

336
00:10:03,617 --> 00:10:04,885
PRESIDENT TRUMP AND HOPEFULLY

337
00:10:04,885 --> 00:10:06,687
THEY CAN WORK OUT A SYSTEM WHERE

338
00:10:06,687 --> 00:10:08,722
THEY CAN HAVE THE SANCTIONS

339
00:10:08,722 --> 00:10:09,623
EASED OFF, WHILE AT THE SAME

340
00:10:09,623 --> 00:10:10,824
TIME WE TAKE A CLOSER LOOK AT

341
00:10:10,824 --> 00:10:12,926
HOW THEY RAMP DOWN.

342
00:10:12,926 --> 00:10:14,361
>>nd HE TOLD THE PRESS TO PACK

343
00:10:14,361 --> 00:10:15,229
THEIR BAGS, THEY'RE GOING TO

344
00:10:15,229 --> 00:10:16,363
SINGAPORE.

345
00:10:16,363 --> 00:10:18,632
>> I WAS GOING TO SAY --

346
00:10:18,632 --> 00:10:19,433
>> NOBEL PEACE PRIZE?

347
00:10:19,433 --> 00:10:21,902
>> I WAS GOING TO SAY YOU CAN

348
00:10:21,902 --> 00:10:24,505
START BY SURPLUS FOOD AS A

349
00:10:24,505 --> 00:10:27,541
GESTURE OF GOODWILL.

350
00:10:27,541 --> 00:10:28,108
>> ALSO INFORMATION.

351
00:10:28,108 --> 00:10:29,410
>> ONE WEEK SUPPLY OF GRAIN.

352
00:10:29,410 --> 00:10:31,178
>> INFORMATION AND INTERNET

353
00:10:31,178 --> 00:10:31,512
ACCESS.

354
00:10:31,512 --> 00:10:32,546
>> BUT ALSO YOU HAVE TO STOP

355
00:10:32,546 --> 00:10:34,515
SAYING THEY'RE ON THEIR KNEES.

356
00:10:34,515 --> 00:10:37,284
BECAUSE THE WHOLE POINT OF THIS,

357
00:10:37,284 --> 00:10:39,353
IS PRIDE AND RESPECT.

358
00:10:39,353 --> 00:10:40,688
AND WHEN YOU SERVICE A CLIENTD

359
00:10:40,688 --> 00:10:42,122
YOU DON'T SAY WE'VE GOT THEM

360
00:10:42,122 --> 00:10:42,823
WHERE WE WANT THEM.

361
00:10:42,823 --> 00:10:44,425
>> THAT'S WHY HE WALKED THEM TO

362
00:10:44,425 --> 00:10:46,527
THE CAR, DID THE GENEROUS --

363
00:10:46,527 --> 00:10:47,328
>> VERY RESPECTFUL.

364
00:10:47,328 --> 00:10:50,798
>> A SUBTLE SHIFT THAT A

365
00:10:50,931 --> 00:00:00,000
SALESMAN KNOWS, GET THEM INSIDE.
