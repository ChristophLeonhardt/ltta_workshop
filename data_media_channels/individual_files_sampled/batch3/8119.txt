IT WILL PUT MORE PRESSURE ON THE PEOPLE GATHER AROUND THE TABLE. I AM GOING TO ASK EACH OF YOU TO COME BACK WITH A 5% BUDGET CUT FROM YOUR DEPARTMENTS, WHETHER IT'S THE SECRETARY A S IT'S THE SECRETARY A C IT'S THE SECRETARY A E IT'S THE SECRETARY A A IT'S THE SECRETARY A Y IT'S THE SECRETARY A , IT'S THE SECRETARY A A IT'S THE SECRETARY A N ADMINISTRATOR, WHATEVER. I'M GOING TO ASK EVERYBODY TO COME BACK WITH A 5% CUT. I THINK YOU WILL BE ABLE TO DO IT. THERE MAY BE A SPECIAL EXEMPTION PERHAPS, I DON'T KNOW WHO THAT EXEMPTION WOULD BE. IF YOU CAN DO MORE THAN 5%, SOME OF YOU WILL SAY HEY, I CAN DO MUCH MORE THAN 5%. I HAVE HEARD ABOUT THE PENNY PLAN FOR 15 YEARS. 1 PENNY EVERY YEAR PER DOLLAR, 1 PENNY EVERY YEAR. AFTER FOUR OR FIVE YEARS, THE COUNTRY IS IN GOOD SHAPE. I'M SAYING, LET'S NOT DO THE PENNY PLAN, LET'S DO THE 5-PENNY PLAN. I THINK YOU CAN DO IT SO I'D LIKE TO HAVE EVERYONE SITTING AROUND THE TABLE, YOUR INCREDIBLE DOMAINS YOU RESIDE OVER, IN SOME CASES VERY WELL, IN SOME CASES BRILLIANTLY, I WOULD LIKE YOU TO COME BACK WITH A 5% CUT. GET RID OF THE FAT, GET RID OF THE WAY STAND I'M SURE YOU CAN DO IT, I'M SURE EVERYBODY IN THE STAFF CAN DO IT. IT WILL HAVE A HUGE IMPACT. THE LAST BUDGET WE HAD TO GO BECAUSE IT WAS MILITARY, WE HAD TO FIX OUR MILITARY. OUR MILITARY IS IN THE PROCESS OF BEING FIXED, CHIPS ARE BEING MADE, MISSILES, ROCKETS, EVERYTHING. OUR NUCLEAR IS BEING BROUGHT TO A LEVEL THAT NOBODY ELSE CAN EVEN IMAGINE. PRAY GOD WE DON'T HAVE TO USE IT, THAT THERE WILL BE NOTHING LIKE WHAT WE HAVE, THERE IS NOTHING LIKE WHAT WE HAVE AND THAT'S WHY I DID THAT. I MADE DEALS WITH THE DEVIL IN ORDER TO GET THAT DONE BECAUSE WE HAD TO IMPROVE OUR MILITARY, OUR MILITARY WAS DEPLETED, IT WAS IN BAD SHAPE. GREAT PEOPLE IN THE MILITARY HADN'T RECEIVED A WAGE INCREASE IN MORE THAN TEN YEARS, NOW THEY ARE GETTING AN INCREASE, FIRST TIME IN MORE THAN TEN YEARS. SO I WANTED TO DO THAT AND IN ORDER TO GET THAT DONE, BECAUSE THE DEMOCRATS WON'T VOTE FOR THE MILITARY, THEY DON'T LIKE LAW ENFORCEMENT, THEY DON'T LIKE BORDERS. WE SEE WHAT'S HAPPENING WITH THE BORDER, PEOPLE ARE COMING IN OPEN CARAVANS AND WE HAD TO STOP THEM EVEN THOUGH THE LAWS ARE TERRIBLE. OUR LAWS ARE TERRIBLE. THEY ARE A LAUGHING STOCK ALL OVER THE WORLD AND WE ARE SUPPOSED TO STOP PEOPLE WITH LAWS THAT AREN'T VERY GOOD BUT WERE DOING BETTER THAN ANYBODY ELSE COULD POSSIBLY EVEN THINK OF. I'D LIKE YOU ALL TO COME BACK WITH A 5% CUT AND I THINK IF YOU CAN DO MORE THAN THAT, I WILL BE VERY HAPPY. THERE ARE SOME PEOPLE SITTING AT THE TABLE, SOME PEOPLE THAT CAN REALLY DO SUBSTANTIALLY MORE THAN THAT. BECAUSE NOW THAT WE HAVE OUR MILITARY TAKEN CARE OF, WE HAVE OUR LAW ENFORCEMENT TAKEN CARE OF, WE CAN DO THINGS WE WEREN'T INTO IN A POSITION TO DO WHEN I FIRST CAME. I WILL SEE YOU AT THE NEXT MEETING, I WILL SEE YOU MANY TIMES BEFORE. THAT'S VERY, VERY IMPORTANT REQUEST I AM MAKING OF EVERYBODY SITTING AROUND THIS TABLE. IT'S A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF MONEY AND IT'S SOMETHING WE CAN DO AND I BELIEVE WE CAN ACTUALLY DO IT EASILY. RATHER THAN GO BY THE PENNY PLAN, CALL IT THE NICKEL PLAN. IT WILL BE A ONE-YEAR NICKEL PLAN, WE MAY DO ANOTHER NICKEL PLAN NEXT YEAR, TOO. THANK YOU ALL VERY MUCH, TO THE PRESS, THANK YOU VERY MUCH. WE KNOW WHAT THE NEW BUDGET IS, IT WILL PROBABLY BE $700 BILLION. 716, 700, THAT'S A VERY SUBSTANTIAL NUMBER, IT'S VERY IMPORTANT, WITHOUT DEFENSE, MAYBE THE REST OF IT DOESN'T MEAN VERY MUCH. IF YOU KNOW IT WAS AT 520 A VERY SHORT WHILE AGO AND THE REASON I BROUGHT IT UP TO 70716 WAS TO BUILD NEW SHIPS, BUILDING NEW INCREDIBLE SUBMARINES, THE FINEST IN THE WORLD, MOST POWERFUL IN THE WORLD. ANYWHERE EVER, DOING THINGS THAT WE HAVE NEVER DONE ON THIS SCALE. THAT INCLUDED A LOT OF REBUILDING OF OUR MILITARY. DESPITE THAT, I AM GOING TO KEEP THAT AT $700 BILLION, DEFENSE. OKAY? THEY ARE INVESTIGATING THEMSELVES, ESSENTIALLY. THEY ARE GREAT, VERY TALENTED PEOPLE. THEY'VE NOW BEEN HERE LONG ENOUGH TO BE ABLE TO DO THIS, THEY ARE IT'S A GREAT GROUP AROUND THIS TABLE, IT'S A GREAT GROUP AND THEY'LL BE ABLE TO DO IT. AND WHEN YOU ADD TO THIS AND COUPLE THIS WITH WHAT LARRY KUDLOW SAID ABOUT HOW WELL WERE DOING WHERE IS LARRY? HERE HE IS. LARRY HAS TO BE VERY HAPPY, YOU DIDN'T EVEN EXPECT THIS. DID YOU EXPECT THIS? IT'S HAPPENING BIGGER AND FASTER THAN I THOUGHT. THIS IS PART OF IT, THIS IS ALL PART OF IT. I COULDN'T DO IT LAST YEAR, I HAD TO DO THE MILITARY. OUR MILITARY WAS IN REALLY BAD SHAPE, PLANES THAT COULDN'T FLY, MILITARY THAT WAS IN A RIDICULOUS SITUATION. SO THAT'S WHAT WE HAD TO DO. WHAT THEY ARE DOING IS THEY ARE DOING IT THEMSELVES. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS? YOU TOLD HIM YOU ARE NOT READY YET. I TOLD THEM THEY'RE NOT READY. WE HAVE REBUILT CHINA, JUST SO YOU UNDERSTAND. OUR COUNTRY HAS REBUILT CHINA, WITH THEIR HARD WORK IN GENIUS, ALSO. BUT HOW OUR COUNTRY HAS ALLOWED ITSELF TO LOSE $500 BILLION A YEAR AND MUCH MORE THAN THAT IS RIDICULOUS. IT'S RIDICULOUS. IT'S HARD FOR THEM TO DO A DEAL BECAUSE THEY'VE HAD IT SO GOOD FOR SO LONG, IT'S A VERY HARD THING FOR THEM TO DO BUT WE HAVE A VERY GOOD RELATIONSHIP WITH CHINA, I HAVE A GREAT
