well another truck used as a terrorist weapon this time in Manhattan killing eight people injuring 13 I see that Isis in their weekly newsletter takes credit for killing more than 20 Crusaders as they say and of course there was a note left behind by the terrorist and Uzbek born man last name psy paav so it clearly was affiliated with Isis here's a picture of the accused terrorists boasting in the hospital of his work I want to show you a clip I showed you this the other day but I want to talk more about it compare the anger and reaction by the Democrats administration of New York City led by Bill DeBlasio compare the anger against the terrorist attack with the raging anger against anti-muslim backlash 'as that did not happen here listen to that clip again I think this is an important time to say this isn't about Islam it's not about what maaske attends there are hundreds of thousands of law-abiding Muslims in New York City who are adversely affected by things like this and it's probably a good time to say we have seen in the aftermath of incidents like this bias incidents hate crimes assaults and voice in his hate crimes people will respond to those investigate those and anybody behind those will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law as has been said here before it is it is a time to come together and do not confuse this terrorist act with any broad brush against in a religion or a particular institution well there you have it let's not talk about the mosques let's not talk about who radicalized him no no no let's talk about a mystical mythical unicorn like creature that's always spoken of but never exists namely the violent backlash against Muslims it's so telling to me that that is the go-to place the bodies were still warm in the morgue and the Deputy Commissioner of Police in New York was threatening people how dare they mentioned Islam as the routier well that's my view let's go to an expert though joining us to have via Skype it's dr. Daniel Pipes the president of the Middle East for I'm good to see you again dr. pipes good to see you as you know to me he didn't need to bring up bias crimes or reactionary vigilante crimes first of all because it was a press conference about a real terrorist attack that really just happened and for him too so obviously shift gears to a hypothetical scenario just seems so obviously an attempt to distract and misdirect but it's also just not true I mean the number of revenge crimes against Muslims in America since 9/11 is pretty close to zero in fact I heard one Sikh fellow was attacked once but that's about it like it's fake and it's a deception that's my view what's yours I think it fits into a context where the left and the Bill DeBlasio a government in New York City is very far to the left insists on seeing Muslims and Islamists and jihadis among them as innocence or as misguided or mentally defective whereas we the West we are responsible we have a history of aggression we are basically evil so what you see here is in miniature a reflection of the notion that ultimately we Westerners are responsible for this act and we should be held to account dr. pipes I have to say I learned something from you about a year ago and I use it almost every day in my conversation and you refer to the five P professionals who should be on guard for Western civilization but have actually flipped sides and I I can rattle them off by memory the the police the press the politicians the prosecutors and the professors and I use that shorthand all the time because in this case we saw the police spokesman we saw the politician right behind him the mayor the press right there you have three out of five piece who are whitewashing the incidents whenever I go to the UK I see either of the five PS the prosecutors whitewashing the incidents do you think that this is trickling down into the rank and file of a New York City police department or is this just yet at the top brass let me add that there's now a six people if they're the priests the priests were preachers here and thought of them back a year ago no I don't think this is trickling down to the rank and file in the police corps from what I understand most law enforcement officers are very skeptical of this outlook this tends to be the front office this tends to be the leadership that's been appointed by the politicians it tends not to be the actual guys on the street the detectives and so forth they are far more hard-nosed about it and realistic but they're not the ones running the show and that's not the ones or interpreting it well and I'm glad to hear that's your assessment of things today but again I was just in the United Kingdom a few days ago visiting our friend Tommy Robinson and literally tonight Tommy was scheduled to have a speech in a private venue 1000 people had paid a big ticket price to hear me the book talks very peaceful there was gonna be 50 private security at this venue outside of the city center like very actually it was like a blue ribbon type event like I like a lecture the venue resisted attempts 2d platform Tommy but the Manchester Police press the club to cancel the police bullied the forum and they cancelled on Tommy and he's now doing it in a parse if you can believe it and and I've seen UK police sir tweet insane things in the UK police are giving lectures about Islam in the UK the police are are saying well we shouldn't prosecute a female genital mutilation because that doesn't help anyone we should just educate so I guess we're and I'm there's hundreds of police in the UK who monitored Twitter and Facebook so I guess what I'm saying my own observation in the UK is if if this attitude from the top brass trickles down if they hire people and direct people and train people in five or ten years the police can actually switch sides is that is that too dramatic to say is do you what would you say the bat it is it is a concern and so that you can see that in Sweden as well where so many of the existing police are disaffected or fearful because they can't execute their duties and so they quit and they're replaced by the sort of type that you just described yes there is the potential certainly the police force can be transformed what I said about most on the beat cops is true but it doesn't have to remain true if they leave the officer coordinates and if they're replaced by these left wingers who see us as the culprit no matter what happens then yeah then you can see a real breakdown in law and order you can see a targeting of victims in effect and a protection of the assaulters you know the other day we spoke to one of your colleagues at Islamist Watch which I understand as a project if you group them in these forums who told us that the police were not allowed to use a certain screening document because the court said if you he said that one of the reasons why they didn't say this was an Islamic terrorist attack is because the courts would say oh you're illegally profiling that that there is some court issued rules for policing that stops police from using plain language to describe things I had thought perhaps that had passed with the passing of the Obama administration remember they called the Nidal Hasan terrorist attack workplace violence is there any change in the ascension of Donald Trump and his appointment to various positions has that political correct slide being reversed or is it proceeding despite Trump's presidency well it's been less than a year of Trump's presidency and I have not from the out I'd seen much change I think the gears are still working against what you and I would like to see let me also point out that New York City is a rather special place of course it's where 9/11 took place and the New York Police Department the NYPD had a reputation to the Deaf a that voted of being the most creative and forceful East Department anywhere and the thing that it did in particular that no one else had the gumption to do was to go to Moss ascend out effect Muslims to go to mosques to talk to people to keep an eye on things including in New Jersey not just in New York City but outside their own district in in New Jersey and this was exposed by the Associated Press the courts came down on it the politicians came down it and it stopped and who knows what just took place could perhaps have been prevented had the old NYPD practices been still in in operation I can't tell you that it would have been stopped but there's certainly a potential maybe now as a result of what just happened in Manhattan there'll be a reversal to the NYPD will once again be able to follow these active and one successful methods well I would hope so but I mean I just referred to Manchester where the police shut down Tommy Robinson's event I it was just a couple of months ago that Manchester where there was a teenage pop concert was attacked by bombs it's completely forgotten and and I hate to say it but I believe this terrorist attack on a bike path in Manhattan will be completely forgotten by the five P professionals for the six P professionals in a matter of weeks I think I feel like we're using in the wrong direction last word today but perhaps you're right and the five or six B's will forget it but I would argue to you that every time there is such a high-profile jihadi attack there is a cohort of individuals in New York in particular but around the country and around the world who say you know I used to not worry about jihadi violence and now I do it's a one-way street no one ever says I used to worry about you violence and now I talked right it's a one-way street and every time is one of these incidents there are more people and there's incident after incident some don't get much attention in which case they don't have much you think but others do get a lot of attention such as this one and that's what I do think they have a bigger yeah if I can be permitted one more observation from my trip to the UK this week I sense that the vast majority of people sense something is amiss but don't have the vocabulary to speak out or if they have the vocabulary to speak out they don't dare do so for fear of social marginalization I I sense in Manchester and in London a numbness that people say there's I don't know what to do and even if I did I couldn't do it all the institutions are against me I sense something is wrong but I don't know what I mean this slow motion car accident and I can't pull out it's it's a it's a terrifying feeling of being stuck it's almost like those nightmares you have where you're stuck in quicksand I think that I mean you and I are woke to this issue Tommy Robinson is woke to this issue and there's activists on the other side pushing this issue I think most Americans Canadians and Brits are in the middle I would say they're paralyzed am I am I miss reading that I don't disagree with you but I would say to each one of these incidents causes more people to wake it there is a process of winter now it's going to slowly and too erratically for my taste and probably for yours as well but it is happening and that gives me a fundamental optimism that this problem will be confronted in a way in a better way than it is today even though there's a lot to be worried about right at the moment but I unlike you have an optimistic outlook in the long term well I'm gonna end on that optimistic note I asked Tommy Robinson in particular if he was optimistic and he he was very not and so out of the three of us you're an optimist let's go with that because I mean I need a reason for hope dr. Daniel Pipes great to see you and and keep up the great work of the Middle East forum that's an excerpt from my daily TV show the Ezra Levant show no one leaves behind a paywall but I thought you'd like this video so we put it on YouTube if you want to subscribe to watch The Daily Show every day including always two interviews today and I read my hate mail just click on this screen and become a Premium Member you
