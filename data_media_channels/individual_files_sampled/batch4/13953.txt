in a move that surprised many Republicans but few political insiders senator Ted Cruz was expected to announce on Friday and did that he would support Donald Trump's bid for the presidency against Hillary Clinton for weeks members of the Cruz team had been hinting at such an announcement Cruz himself had quietly hinted he was reconsidering his publicly non-committal stance on the candidate who labeled him lyin Ted suggested he was a serial adulterer called his wife ugly and said his father was a conspirator in the murder of JFK a man Cruz himself had called a pathological liar and a non conservative charlatan but on Friday two days before the first debate political broke the news that Cruz would endorse Trump it's a bad if understandable political move here are the things you need to know first Cruz has experienced more pressure than anyone else in America over Trump except for maybe me Cruz has been hampered by former allies in the media and the Republican Party for not openly embracing Trump and bowing before his great god-king that criticism existed before the RNC escalated dramatically in the days afterward more on that in a second Cruz's donors tried away from him some of his biggest boosters and talk-radio began ripping him regularly the RNC Chairman Reince Priebus or prince Regis as a friend calls him openly threatened his future presidential prospects Trump is and his allies suggested primary Nkrumah the Texas Senate race which put Cruz in a rough spot politically with a few words he thought he could end all the pressure the calculation was that simple and I guess it deserves at least a little bit of sympathy he is a politician second point there's a pretty bad political movement when I say pretty bad I mean this is Hindenburg level disaster bad it's fully understandable to say you'll vote for Trump but continue to acknowledge he's a disaster area for conservatives this is what Mark Levin does that doesn't appear to be what Cruz is doing Cruz is now announcing he's been surprised by Trump's new message discipline even as Trump embraces Vladimir Putin government-sponsored maternity leave a plan to cram down tuition price controls in an expansion of Medicaid this puts him less in the hold your nose and vote from category than the Trump train category and it's partially due to timing the timing undercuts Cruz's entire image as a man of principle in a world of dirty politics he used Trump's announcement of Senator Mike Lee as a potential Supreme Court pick as a fig leaf for the move but everyone can see that it's a fig leaf the move appears transparently political not principled principled support for Trump it could have come before the convention or at the convention or just after the convention to jump on board two days before the debates at a time when Trump is obviously ratcheting up pressure on never Trump pers to jump aboard manipulative it seems even more manipulative given Cruz's early warmth towards frumps when he thought he could ride Trump's coat tails in the nomination and then he broke with Trump which seems more principled and now here iam braces Trump just in time for the election it's worth noting here that Cruz is taking a real risk by endorsing Trump Cruz's Trump endorsement is risky not just because he risks fracturing his base hoping presumably they'll forget about his endorsement of Trump losses and acknowledging his correctness of Trump wins but because Trump could actually destroy him Trump's done that before as I reported at the time back in the RNC Cruz's speech at the RNC was designed to be an overture to Trump it was actually a quasi endorsement that didn't explicitly provide support for Trump but obviously paved the way for that kind of support Cruz negotiated that language in advance with Trump Trump knew about it and then Trump used the vagueness of the speech as an opportunity to cast Cruz publicly as a traitor sending his minions to the convention floor to whip up boos before popping in to the convention himself like a WWE hero to Cruz's villain it's worth noting that on Friday is possible that the Trump could have done the same thing to Cruz again Cruz could have been putting his head on the chopping block Ned Stark style only for Trump to go full joffrey and behead him from said after the RNC he wouldn't accept Cruz's endorsement but it appears the Kellyanne Conway's was successful in prying Trump's phone from his fingers in the moments after Cruz submitted and now he says he's glad to have Cruz's endorsement so what's the outcome likely to be well Chris isn't gonna move a lot of voters over to Trump most Cruz voters who haven't moved over to Trump supported Cruz out of principle not out of personal loyalty to him and they're not gonna be persuaded to move to Trump now this morning Glenn Beck just crushed Cruz on the air they'll feel their guy capitulated because the establishment forced him to kneel before Zod crews will have undercut his own image and Trump probably won't be able to help gloating in the days to come here's Cruz's best bet if Trump wins he'll have been on the winning team if Trump loses he won't be blamed for the loss that's true as far as it goes but because of how Cruz played his hand here he's gonna be seen less as a reluctant man pushing Trump to victory than a guy who chose expedience over principle which is actually kind of tragic since Cruz probably is a man of principle victimized by both the system that crushes principle and 'if he can still manipulate that system to his own ends he can't he'd be better off acknowledging that simple fact and standing with the principles he supposedly believed I'm Ben Shapiro this is the Ben Shapiro show all righty so lots to talk about today today the big debate is coming and I'm gonna give you my preview I'm gonna give you what I think the headlines tomorrow will be I'm gonna tell you why I woke up this morning and I thought to myself what the f did you people do what did you do like now it finally comes down to it we're at the debate you know it's sort of hit there's some truths in life that sort of hit you randomly wait I've heard from people when they lose a close relative that they'll be okay for a while and then they'll just think about the relative and they'll think that's really awful well every so often in this election cycle you just look around and you go okay tonight the debate is going to be between the Wicked Witch of the West and Biff Tannen like it's actually gonna be between it's gonna be between Lennie from Of Mice and Men and the most corrupt woman in the history of American politics and you think to yourself oh god one of these people is gonna be leader of the free world what did you do even if you prefer Trump even if you prefer even if you're excited about Trump I don't know how I can be excited about Trump as opposed to just excited about Hillary losing man I understand being excited about Hillary losing totally on board watching her weep tears of salty salty anguish over losing to Donald Trump would be just the most fitting capstone to her ridiculous political career and the media weeping into their into their beer would also be particularly rich that would be enjoyable watching all these people crying but then Trump would also be president and that's not gonna be awesome just just saying

you watch this thing it's gonna be like the Superbowl everybody's gonna watch it I don't know who's making their mind up based on this debate if I mean honestly I made a couple of miscalculations in this election cycle just be honest with you my my prediction is in predictions in this election cycle have not been up to their normal par but partially that's because I thought that Americans wanted a president who wasn't a complete moron and partially I thought that's because Americans didn't want a president who was a complete corrupt hand bag of lunacy and I was wrong so I apologize for that my opinion of American voters was apparently too high and so we end up with the debate between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton for the leadership of the free world which is it's America the reality show 2016 Harambee where are you when we needed you it's just tragic but Trump has all the advantages going into this debates I'm gonna put aside my own personal rage over this over this election cycle and put aside the fact that I think everyone is stupid and everything is stupid I'm gonna drink heavily during this debate I have to be an event in Simi Valley later today covering this thing I'll cover it live non-daily wire.com I'll be covering it on Twitter so make sure that you pay attention there but we'll get back to my issues of rage in just a minute the fact that the lesser of two evils has led us to a place where everything stinks where the debate tonight is gonna go something like this Hillary Clinton Donald you're stupid Donald Trump is so crooked cucit Hillary Hillary Donald you're also crooked Trump you're crooked and ugly Hillary sexist Trump your husband raped people Hillary yeah congratulations America one of these two people will be a president okay so don't worry we'll get back to more hot rage spewing from me hens foot but Trump has all the advantages going in so there's some major advantages that Trump has going in tonight and he should win the debate he should I'm predicting it now Trump should win the debate if he can hold himself in check right now Hillary's entire Payne her entire campaign is is it possible is it possible that she can win just by convincing the American public that Trump is enough Trump's entire campaign is don't look like a nut so it's easier for a nut to look not like a nut for 90 minutes if you've ever met somebody who's completely insane in your life they actually play normal people pretty well most of the time it's only every so often you realize they think that the curtains are talking to them but most of the time crazy people act kind of not crazy which is why it's sort of hard to deal with with people who legitimately have a screw loose assuming Trump is crazy he may not be he may just be stupid but assuming Trump is crazy he can play not crazy for 90 minutes which is a more of an advantage Hillary's main fault here in the polls is people think she's dishonest if you're if you're a liar if you're a dishonest person people think you're dishonest then five seconds of you is enough to convince them that you're just as dishonest as everyone ever thought you were if however you're crazy it's actually not that hard to make it seem as though you're not so here are some of the advantages first it is now a dead heat this race is a dead heat and that is less a testament to Trump being great at this and more testament to the fact that Hillary's the worst political candidate in the history of humankind I mean like there-there are cave dwellers neanderthal cave dwellers back before the rise of human language who were worse politicians than Hill and that she's worse than I think Hillary Clinton it's very it's very possible she could have lost to like ugh the caveman in an election in it like now today if you brought the caveman who can't speak English and just grunts at people aaaghh the caveman could probably beat Hillary in a national election because she's just this bad at this you know last week we played that tape of her screaming why aren't I up by 50 points because of tape like that Hillary so the numbers are really bad the new polls show dead heat dead heat between Trump and Clinton so Bloomberg today has Trump up over Clinton in a four-way race 43 to 41 so as I've said before this is not Trump doing unbelievably well he still can't break 43 percent in a national poll four-way but he can do but he can't beat her if enough people go third party and this is what's amazing a lot of focus being put on the never Trump errs now because everybody's got to get on the Trump train there are more Republicans on the Trump train then Democrats on the Hillary Train according to an ABC poll poll yesterday 87 percent of Republicans 87 percent of Republicans are going to vote for Trump 84 percent of Democrats are gonna vote for Hillary 45% of Republicans something like that are enthusiastic about voting Trump only 34 percent of Democrats are enthusiastic about voting Hillary the new CNN o RC poll shows Trump up 1 in a four-way race CNN RC has Trump up 1 in Colorado which means he wins the election down one in Pennsylvania Hillary had this firewall the firewall is gone what's more Trump is up 59 points among white non-college educated men and 47% of Americans think Trump is going in the Trump's gonna lose the debate tonight 47% think Hillary will win only 33% think Trump will win that means Trump is at a massive advantage expectations that's the name of the game all Trump has to do is not almost literally diarrhea himself on stage or eat a Mexican baby and he wins the race tonight he wins any wins the debate tonight Hillary Clinton has to prove that she's likable she has to prove that she's human just to prove she's not dead all of these are uphill battles for walking corpse so excuse me nate silver who writes this morning quote the latest polling is consistent with a Clinton lead of only 1 percent nationally state firewall breaking up trend lines awful are you ready for this Lefty's it's panic time okay I mean I think everyone is panic time for either of these who can that it's winning but left it people who are Hillary allies panic panic panic galore okay right now here's the panic if the election were held today according to Nate Silver Hillary would lose if the election were held today there is a 55 percent shot that Trump wins whoa the reason for that the reason for that is that Hillary is legitimately awful at this in every way so Robby Mook is her campaign spokesperson fitting name Robby Mook was was on Jake Tapper on CNN and Jake Tapper asked to Robby Mook about new emails revealed on Friday showing that one of the IT people actually talked about Hillary's coverup operation and direct quote Hillary's cover-up operation in the emails and Robby Mook looks like he wants to actually slice off his own ears in the middle of this particular interview an IT contractor managing Hilary Clinton's private email server made reference to the quote Hilary cover-up operation in a work ticket he used those words after his senior Clinton aide asked him to off-lead delete emails after 60 days this IT workers certainly sounded like he thought he was covering something up now look Jake first of all I'm actually glad you asked this question because a lot of this stuff is swirling around there in the ether it's important to pull back and look at the facts here the FBI did a comprehensive and deep investigation into this and at the conclusion of that FBI director Comey came out and said to the world that there was no case here that there that that they did not have evidence of wrongdoing on Hilary's part so what's the number recover improperly so impressed what's Hilary's cover-up operation and mook has no answer for that because Hillary's cover-up opera operation can be translated in English as Hillary's cover-up operation because she's covering things up and it's amazing I mean MOOC is also asked he specifically asked about Hillary staffers he says don't worry we're brutally honest to her mm-hmm the Secretary Clinton have anyone in her orbit who can be brutally honest and frank with her I asked that because it seems like based on a lot of the information we've gotten about her emails and the like that she might not have people like that and in debate prep it would be very important for somebody to really be able to go after her to prepare her for a debate and I don't know that she has anybody like that in her orbit well she absolutely does Jake anybody who's worked for Secretary Clinton first of all knows that she surrounds herself with experts on every matter that she looks into she just did a call earlier this is an indefinite he's out there she surrounds herself with experts like Robby Mook yeah I'm sure that I'm sure that everybody takes this seriously so so number one the numbers don't favor Hillary number two there are different standards for these particular candidates there are different standards haven't discussed that in just one second but first I want to welcome a new advertiser lift so I know a lot of people use competitors to lift lift is better than its competitors it's better than its competitors they have a fully vetted ten point safety standard including criminal and DMV background checks you don't get put - somebody's crappy car every car has to be made within it within I think it's the last six years is the limit on lift cars you can tip in the app which leads to happier drivers which means that the drivers tend to be nicer to you nine out of ten lift rides gonna do five star rating from the passenger it's a great all-around experience I use lifts my wife uses lifts she's a doctor which means she has to come home in the middle of the night and that means that I'm worried about her because my wife is a very attractive young lady and I don't want her coming home in the middle of the night with crepes and there have been a couple of times using other services where she's gotten in a car with a creep and it's not a pretty picture if you want somebody who's safe if you want somebody who's secure if you want if you want a ride that's going to be nicer than the average for for some of the other services lyft is the place to go right now lyft offers our listeners a special deal you get three free rides up to ten bucks

people have actually just stopped even having a car because lyft is so convenient for them ok so I want to make a quick note before we have to pause right here small it sounds like I'm dying it's because I'm still I've still been infected by the Hillary plague I watched the YouTube video of her collapsing and it was so contagious and I'm still dying weeks later but in any case I'm the standards here Trump has a lower standard people know Trump's ignorant they're not expecting him to be fully baked on policy they know he's colorful which is to say he says crazy things they know that he'll say offensive stuff they know that he kind of lies out of habit but they think that that's just a facet of his truth-telling he just he says things that are honest but not honest Hillary they know she's dishonest they hate her there's a far better shot Trump is able to survive ninety minutes without looking like a complete nutcase and that Hillary's able to look honest over the course of ninety minutes so Trump has advantages we're gonna talk more about those advantages go over to Daly wire calm and subscribe right now eight bucks a month and that cuts you and that allows you to
