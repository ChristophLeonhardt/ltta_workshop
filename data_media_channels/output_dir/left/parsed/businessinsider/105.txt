this is 8 pounds of Papa John's garlic
sauce when people open that box they are
going for that garlic sauce so I never
knew what was in this sauce
it looks like Drano
hey guys you want some pizza
yeah it's garlic sauce
I think the first drop was good
and then the rest of them so this is the
practical way of using it you know just
just a little bit you don't need to use
the whole thing
little dollop and then take a bit of the
crust I wouldn't use the peeps apart
so the problem with these is that there
is never enough so the jug solves that
problem but also presents a new one
which I've only had this on pizza I've
never had it on chicken and fries no no
but I'm willing to try it I like it on
pizza I love the sauce on pizza
it looks like Drano like something that
you'd pour down your sink yeah I don't
like it's so much more buttery like this
yeah I don't like it it's own is very
savory kind of strong it's straight
butter mm-hmm
no more I saw a poor field left of this
garlic sauce I have no clue what I'm
gonna do with it
what would you guys do with it
