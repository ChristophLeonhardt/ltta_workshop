instructions to reunite more than 2300 children separated from adults under the policy are likely to take weeks to draft out and carry out an administration official told The Wall Street Journal as NBC News reports adults who are intercepted entering the country illegally receive something called an a file number from DHS that designates their legal case if they are accompanied by their children the kids received the same a file number if parents are separated from their children however the children receive a different a file number which can make it more complicated to pair parent and child in the future after the migrant parents who were separated from their kids have their cases adjudicated meaning after they are deported jailed or released they can use these a file numbers to locate their children or arrange communication no that should be simple for them that's just a portion of the children's crisis at the border the Pentagon confirmed Thursday that the Department of Health and Human Services had requested they provide space for 20,000 migrant children at military bases in Texas and Arkansas so a senior Trump administration official said yesterday that about 500 of the more than 2300 children separated from their families at the us-mexico border have been reunited since May and Health and Human Services Secretary Alex azar tells The Washington Post this quote we keep in touch with the parents under any circumstances to ensure placement with relatives or if parents are released but the anecdotal evidence is mounting that that's just not the case the New Yorkers Jonathan Blitzer reports from a New Mexico facility on 50 mothers who've been separated from their kids he writes that one mom told him quote a few of them know where their kids are mothers are going to be leaving this facility with psychological problems Blitzer reports none of the agents has explained to the mothers how they can locate their children The Washington Post has published an account from a public defender who described a hearing with a mother whose child had been taken from her quote one of my colleagues asked the federal agent on the stand about the whereabouts of my clients child the Justice Department prosecutor objected to the relevance of the questions the judge turned on the prosecutor demanding to know why this was not relevant at one point the judge slammed his hand on the desk sending a pen flying this type of emotional display is unheard of in federal court the judge said I cannot understand this if someone at the jail takes your wallet they give you a receipt they take your kids and you get nothing not even a slip of paper or this report from the state of Maryland where many children have reportedly been sent with little information one is 18 months old several are too young to speak to their new caregivers or help social workers track down relatives who could take them in lawyers are trying to figure out how to put together asylum claims for six-year-olds six year olds who don't know why they fled their countries it is clear this crisis is far from over to put things in perspective a map compiled by The Washington Post shows where children are being sent around the u.s. Jo and it's if you take a look at this they're they're scattered that had come from the Texas border places as far as Washington State and up here in New York City it's unbelievable and you know the wretchedness of what Donald Trump is done here and I must add those who were supporting Donald Trump blindly claiming that sending young children young children to two places 2,000 miles away from where their parents are is like sending them to summer camp yeah the wretchedness of that that mindset the wretchedness the depravity you you do wonder what actually has happened to people who speak like that in defense of a president John Heilemann that deserves no defense certainly not in this case and you know Donald Trump said during the campaign famously you could shoot somebody in the middle of Fifth Avenue and his supporters would still support him perhaps that is the case perhaps but apparently he can't push a policy that tears babies from their mothers breasts while they're breastfeeding that separates two-year-old children infants and toddlers and throws them into one what one Intel agent told me reminded him of black sites where we put terrorists after 9/11 and not have a fierce political blowback I while we focused on the human dimension of this let's talk for a second about the political dimension of this Republicans are scared as hell on Capitol Hill people inside the Trump administration are scared as hell it's I smell the fear inside of there like I did during Katrina they know something horrible has gone wrong the question is John what will the impact of all of this be politically well I think it's a little too early to say partly because the fact the story is still unfolding it's there's no question Joe that that the president obviously you guys talked about this on the program yesterday the president obviously never likes to climb down he rarely has folded in the face of political pressure is rarely capitulated in quite the way that he did two days ago and the reason that he did was for all the reasons you just said primarily that he had I think he was faced with polling data and an intuition that correctly asserted that if Republicans were saddled with this policy going forward there were going to be maybe a hundred Republican congressional districts that were put in play the Republic the house is already in jeopardy likely to turn over to Democrats in the fall but that the political consequences of this would have turned a blue a likely blue wave into not just I don't want to use like stupid metaphors like tsunami but it would have been just a cat a catastrophe but politically not just guaranteeing the Democrats to take back the house but guaranteeing that they would take it by enormous enormous margins yeah Mika you've you and I have debated for some time about the impact of Donald Trump the long-term impact of Donald Trump I've always said and it's actually what Charles Krauthammer said in his last column that that this president is this is a test of our system and so far the system has checked his absolute worst instincts and they are deplorable instincts and they I used that word using it at the same time deranged at the same time it's interesting yesterday was the first time mica that you have said that I've heard you say watching the news he's crossed the line he's gone too far in a way like you you believe that from day one but you're saying in a way that is going to cost him long term he screwed up and he's going to pay for this no he will be forever remembered as the president who traumatized little children that's his brand now he's the president who purposefully traumatized babies and children and he traumatized them for his political gain or to look strong or to look like kim jeong-hoon i mean he has built up to this moment to the point where now he is the president of the united states of america who took our country on a collision course downhill tearing at every seam being the president who abused little children and you see in this White House a sinking ship you see every man for himself you see the Attorney General now lying trying to backflip on his own lies when he put out this policy you see the first lady trying her best to separate herself from this because she too could have been one of those children except she doesn't look like them but she knows this is bad so she rushes to the border and who cares what she's wearing she probably was talking to her husband but her husband tried to take that and make it a PR twist as well which is deranged and sick but aside from the point you've got his daughter who is the counselor for the president he was forever revealed as a complete fake on these issues there's no turning back from it for Ivanka Trump you have mattes sitting next to him and Pompeyo sitting next to him trying so hard to keep it together even though the president has traumatized small children whose men whose families were seeking asylum this is not one of those things where maybe or maybe not he's gone too far he knows he's gone too far and Donny Deutsch you know what this president's thinking he's pulling back because this is a massive PR failure and whether Ivanka said daddy this doesn't look good or Trump said that Ivanka said daddy just this doesn't look good that reporting is fascinating you know why because that's all they care about what it looks like it's deranged it's abusive it's cruel it's evil and the entire world is watching it is now the time that he has gone too far question mark go the I want to attach what you just said to the question into arrest John about politicizing and I could put an exclamation mark about everything you said and it was particularly reprehensible when a vodka said it looks a certain way what has to happen now this can no longer be about who Trump is it has to be about who we are if we are working towards November we can no longer say Trump's the bad guy if you vote for Trump you're the bad guy if you vote for Trump you are ripping children from parents onto the mistake that we've made in the past is look at that bad guy over there look at that bad guy what the Democrats have to do is make the next election a referendum I'm not who Trump is but who you are and we all that that's the big difference you can no longer now as a voter because it's now or not about taxes it's not even about some abstract term of immigration or or nationalism if you vote for Trump then you the voter you not Donald Trump or standing at the border like Nazis going you hear you hear and I think we now have to flip it and it's a given the evilness of Donald Trump but if you vote you can no longer separate yourself you can't say well he's okay but and I think that gymnastics and I think that jiu-jitsu has to happen all right Jonathan Lemire yeah I mean this crisis is is so overwhelming and these images are so heartbreaking and the logistical challenges ahead to try to reunite these children and their families are so staggering that yes this does feel like a different moment for this presidency we will see if this is indeed that defining moment he got through Charlottesville he has the ability to he was of course damaged as moral leadership was irreparably hurt there but he survived it this is a president who has the ability to change the subject who has spun off one time for another no it's this is this is a different that's how this is the moment feels different here you want to know why it's different because it's going to be a long time before any of these children are back with their parents if Joe they get back with their parents there's going to be abuse there's going to be problems that they can't confront and they can't stop this waterfall of pain that they have inflicted on small children they can't clean this I mean it's a disaster yeah well and following up on what Jonathan lemierre's said and he started talking about it you've got Charlottesville where Donald Trump of course defended white supremacists with moral equivalency you've got even this year Donald Trump calling Hispanics breeders just last week saying that immigrants coming across the border were quote infesting America and no he wasn't talking about gang members he put them as part of the crowd later in a phrase you could you could talk again about him denying any knowledge of David Duke or the Ku Klux Klan you could go through two years where people supporting Donald Trump are not supporting Donald Trump cannot say oh I'm just supporting because he's giving him hell and watching no he's he's been openly racist just like we said back in December of openly racist and if you support him then you're supporting that and you are that it's that simple and and that's what we've come to now and if you support Donald Trump after there you me it's it's very it's very clear that you can't just say oh you know what the economy's moved on and I'm just sort of disaffected and neither side works nice support Donald Trump but less less line of my column of The Washington Post following up on what Donny Deutsch said is that so many Republicans still support this depraved man and his malignant movement could actually be the most damning element of this tragic American tale and the question remains after this I'm not saying people should support Hillary Clinton Servat 'iv I'm far more conservative than anybody around this table on immigration people watching this show would not like how conservative I am on immigration or how conservative I am on entitlement reform or how conservative I am on social issues or how conservative I am on the economy but you me this so transcends ideology I have no idea how anybody can still support this man after what we've seen this week well this week was really the biggest test of loyalty for hardened Trump supporters who have followed this president and supported him through scandal after scandal for scandal I just came back from Minnesota and a rally that he had in Duluth and people were supporting him more than ever and they're not rare I talk to so many people who were representative of a quiting Yaak University poll that was that was released this week that said 55 to 35 percent of 55 percent of Republicans support the policy of separating children so Republicans were as a whole were backing him for people calling themselves Republicans and when I was in Minnesota talking to people I was getting stories from people that said that these children yes young children who are now being detained that they need to be taught a lesson and that they are being taught by their parents to break u.s. laws and as a result they deserve to be in these detention facilities they deserve to be traumatized essentially and be away from their parents and even after the President signed the executive order when I asked people afterwards you know what do you make of the president's policy now they were saying well he's caving in to pressure and that it's really that he really should stick to his guns on this issue because people are quote unquote infest America a lot of them cast this and as really defending American culture as something of being white frankly of looking at America and saying we don't need these brown people in our country and I was in some ways surprised by this but also in some ways we know that Trump supporters have stuck with him in the long term through all sorts of things but this was kind of stunning in some ways it is stunning and we have so much more still ahead on Morning Joe president Trump says the governor of Puerto Rico has quote the easiest job in the world might have been one of those jokes where he thought he wasn't joking but you really know that
