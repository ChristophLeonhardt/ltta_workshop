hi my name is tattoo but you can call me
tattoo because that's my name you're
probably thinking how did I get myself
into this situation well it all started
three days ago when I answered the door
then my life changed forever this is my
story
The Chronicles have a television cartoon
Oh
Oh
yours with the perfect love I swear whoa
until I had your my world was Adi was
motioning and I bested I was but when I
got you back my world was
I woke up slightly scared I just had a
nightmare
it was about a giant bunny I know what
you're thinking that's not scary the
loan i'm saying is then you don't see
one you will never know i decided to get
up and do nothing then i took a dump
fresh my scene then i took a dump then I
changed the butterfly in the living room
then I took a dump then I swore on my
uncle's grave that I'm not going to take
another dump till tomorrow because this
was getting ridiculous then I took
another dump I'm going to be honest with
you I'm a loser people ask me why have
you got so many friends and I'm like
what I haven't got any friends and they
say I know I just wanted to rub it in
your face I think that's me but it's
true I have none
technically I once had three friends but
only one knew my name he's dead now
helicopter accident as for the other two
one insists that he hates me and that we
will never be friends however I think
that his hurtful words and his
restraining order against me is just him
playing hard to get and as for the other
one they made him mama
then someone was at the door so I
decided to open it scale
hi sir my name is Reuben salami I was
wondering if I could take some of your
time and have a little chat you're not
selling anything are you no no I'm not
selling anything ha ha ha I'm selling
camels why would I want a camel you
could spank the camels bottom and say
yeah or not you could race the camel
with other camels in the London borough
yeah you can beatbox with the camel baba
channel watch you and your camel could
could build a house you don't wait no
much you could break dance with the
camel imagine you in the camel oh oh oh
oh yes yes oh oh oh bang bang
what about a horse a horse are you
kidding me that doesn't make sense why
would you want a horse in London ha hey
well that's my god keep it it's free I'm
broke
but I really want a camel I'll only buy
it if it's reasonably price that's ten
thousand pounds ok I think fine I hope
I'm not out of line sir but you are
genuinely amazing
what do you want al-qaeda
Yago delivery boy Wow my very own five
camels this is without a doubt the best
day of my life
equally fuck how did you get in here
after that painful unfortunate
misunderstanding I decided to forget
about it it's not his fault he's sad
anyway I should be happy I have my very
own five camels so I decided to open it
but unfortunately there was one slight
problem it wasn't the camel I decided to
put the animal back in the cage and I
might have let my emotions get the
better of me it didn't really hurt
because I'm really strong and I don't
feel pain no that's not me
might have hurt a big white pepper not
too much Chinese noble quite a lot
actually no I remember now that was
probably the worst thing I've ever said
yes I think that groupid salami and I
need a chair right now so I waited and I
waited and I waited but he wasn't
picking up maybe because he was scared
and I'm a scary type of guy maybe he's
not picking up because I didn't dial his
number
oh that was embarrassing in one's
looking don't worry kiss it - oh yeah
that's what I'm talking about MA yeah
manhandle me you Beast yes yes oh oh
look meme eyes yeah but me my god let's
