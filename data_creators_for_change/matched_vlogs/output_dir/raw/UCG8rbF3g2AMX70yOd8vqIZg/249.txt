Yo. Can I put life on pause real quick?

40
00:01:06,980 --> 00:01:08,380

47
00:01:16,620 --> 00:01:17,120

48
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:17,900
Don't you mean a plate?

49
00:01:17,900 --> 00:01:18,400

*Twelve seconds later*

58
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:42,880
Took a shower, cleaned up and stuff and I don't know what happened but Evan actually fell asleep.

59
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:44,860

*snoring*

62
00:01:49,940 --> 00:01:54,500
So, we're gonna play a little game. It's called 'How many taco shells can we put on Evan while he's asleep?'

63
00:01:54,780 --> 00:01:55,600
*snoring*

64
00:01:55,880 --> 00:02:21,940
*funky music consisting of trumpets and electric bongos*

65
00:02:23,340 --> 00:02:24,140

89
00:03:15,620 --> 00:03:17,120
Real Life Kong likes Fake Kong.

00:03:26,140 --> 00:03:27,720
Not a cool thing. Not a cool thing at all.

95
00:03:28,420 --> 00:03:31,420
I know puppy you can't reproduce but your still my guy.

96
00:03:31,420 --> 00:03:32,760
AND you have 2 million followers on Instagram.

97
00:03:33,260 --> 00:03:38,600
OH, LOOK WHO IT IS! Oh that's just great that's just freakin great.

98
00:03:38,780 --> 00:03:42,720
I'm mad too.Take this Ayla go remove his balls.

99
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:46,780
Oh oh! Good for you he doesn't have any because he's a stuffed animal.

100
00:03:46,780 --> 00:03:50,000
Listen to me Kong has been going to the...Oh

101
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:55,760
Kong is perfectly fine I've been taking care of him.

102
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:58,760
Yeah except for the fact that HE CAN'T MAKE BABIES!

103
00:03:58,760 --> 00:04:01,320
Literally humans are on Earth for one f*cking reason.

104
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:04,240
And what is that Evan? To make babies.

105
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:05,540
Exactly.

106
00:04:05,540 --> 00:04:07,680
You didn't tell everyone that you were cool with this.

107
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:09,080
I mean look.

108
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:10,120

109
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:12,280
I may have made the appointment. Kong look...

If Kong...

116
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:21,040
If Kong were to reproduce I'm not even kidding Logang,

117
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:26,680
like his puppies could sell for 20k a pop, 25k a pop, 30k a pop or even a million dollars a pop.

118
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:28,960
So then if you could sell it for that much.

119
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:30,540
Then why did you make me make this appointment.

120
00:04:30,540 --> 00:04:32,560
I didn't make you make this appointment.

121
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:33,620

Ayla open your eyes.

127
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:54,880
That was a pretty clean break.

128
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:57,600
OMG! Why would you do this on your bed?

129
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:58,380

00:13:54,509 --> 00:13:57,360
independently and different thinking
outside of the box not listening to

00:13:57,360 --> 00:14:00,870
society telling you what you can and
cannot do it's a beautiful thing guys

264
00:14:00,870 --> 00:14:04,860
