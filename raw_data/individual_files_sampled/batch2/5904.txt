joining us now is Layne Murdock she's a high school student from Ridgefield Connecticut it's a town just minutes away from Sandy Hook elementary school Sally Kerrigan joins us as well she's a survivor of the Columbine High School shooting Lane by the way organized the National War walkout on April 20th which is also the anniversary of the mass shootings at Columbine High School in 1999 both of these people are activists against gun violence they're participating in today's March thank you to both of you for being here you were also you played a role in the March 14th walk outs across the nation what do those achieve and what message are you trying to send I think they send a wonderful rep like symbolic representation to all the students across the country I think right now is getting all that symbolism together and turning it into real change I think they're also just a great way to teach kids organizing empowerment other than just the day after and the day tearing and and one thing that stood out to me is these were remarkable on March 14th where remarkable walkout and April 20th will be and I know parents who really supported their kids in doing so there was still some kids in America punished for doing so by the way I will I just want to remind you all if that happens to your kids or you are a student and that happens to you get in touch with us at MSNBC and we will take care of that we will go and and and and talk about the fact that there is a First Amendment in this country your children have the same god-given right to protest that everybody else is given in this country so thank you for these that watch this you being a Columbine survivor first of all the years the 19 years processing all of that sense is this something that ever leaves you never and it always always changes how I feel for some reason this go-around with the Parkland shooting thanks to these kids it's actually given me a sense of hope that I've never felt before so I appreciate it I'm actually optimistic for once well you guys are the beginning of it right there there are this entire generation of students like lane or the Parkland kids they have all been in the post column by an era that changed things for the for everybody in in the world they didn't know such a thing no it was an anomaly and that's what we were told we were counseled consoled promised that this would never happen again I want to pick up on the promise part what were you promised and how disappointed are you because I imagined none of those promises came true well I think we were promised that the changes were you know they looked at video games and music and bullying and mental health which is still in the news and still needs to be addressed but um they looked at those were the answers so and that's what we were told and we believed them and so I felt like that's how we were promised we were told that was the answer and this will never happen again yeah thank you years later here you and Lane you're just not willing to believe those promises anymore no I was willing you guys are saying if you guys can by the way we are the generation that is almost cured cancer and we've put people on the moon we've done all of those things and yet this is a simple one that our generation hasn't been able to solve so it sounds like you are going to yeah I mean our lives are at stake and that's why I'm always appalled when people are like who are you to protest I'm like this is my life and this is you know learning to do lockdown drills since first grade living in fear America's children have grown up in fear so how could we not protest you know in Lane I think about you've picked this state for the walkout in commemoration and honor of what happened to Columbine April 20th you're gonna lead this movement to get people out and walking out of their classrooms I'm gonna assume you weren't even a life you know I were doing 2002 so so there you go I mean look at the legacy that Columbine has left it is a legacy you did not want to have that is for sure but when you pick up the mantle here laying with this what do you hope you do and do you think that the the communal experience of all of these horrific atrocities is what's really gonna put all of this propel it forward to some sort of a success the measure of success for you I think I think so and I think it has to convey lence in this country is institutionalized it's something that's ingrained in American society and it's something that we all have some sort of experience with so I think that kind of same personal experience can really unite us together I mean Columbine was in 1999 and I wasn't even born yet and we still haven't had really impactful changes your entire life but but it is worth noting that whether it's Sandy Hook promise or every town or Giffords or or moms or what you've been doing in celebration of a commemoration of what happened in Columbine but also with Sandy Hook and what you experienced in Columbine this is coming together now it was all finally happening and that is why it's important for everybody not to let go of this Lane thank you for what you're doing Sally
