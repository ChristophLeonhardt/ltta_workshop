>> Shepard: ON THE RUSSIA
PART OF THIS, REACTION IS IN
AND IT'S PRETTY UNIFORMED.
CHUCK SCHUMER ONE WHO HAS
GIVEN A QUOTE TODAY, SAYS
THE PRESIDENT'S SUPPORT FOR
INVITING RUSSIA BACK TO THE
G-7 JUST AFTER THEY MEDDLED
IN THE ELECTION TO SUPPORT
HIS CAMPAIGN WILL LEAVE
MILLIONS OF AMERICANS WITH
SERIOUS QUESTIONS AND
SUSPICIONS.
AGAIN, THAT FROM CHUCK
SCHUMER.
AND THEN FROM THE REPUBLICAN
BEN SASSE, THIS IS WEAK.
PUTIN IS NOT OUR FRIEND.
HE IS NOT THE PRESIDENT'S
BUDDY.
HE IS A THUG, USING SOVIET
STYLE AGGRESSION TO WAGE A
SHADOW WAR AGAINST AMERICA
AND OUR LEADERS SHOULD ACT
LIKE IT.
DOES THE PRESIDENT -- IS HE
AWARE OF THESE MATTERS?
>> I THINK HE IS.
THE PRESIDENT FEELS LIKE
WHENEVER YOU HAVE AN
ADVERSARY IT'S IMPORTANT TO
TALK TO THEM.
AND I THINK THAT'S WHAT HE
WAS GETTING AT THIS MORNING.
BUT, YOU KNOW, NOT ONLY WILL
THERE BE MEMBERS OF CONGRESS
WHO DISAGREE WITH THIS, BUT
ALSO OUR ALLIES AROUND THE
WORLD.
AND THEY WILL SAY THAT
BASICALLY WE'RE PROBABLY
REWARDING BAD BEHAVIOR IF WE
ALLOW RUSSIA BACK INTO THE
G-7, WHAT USED TO BE THE G-8
WITHOUT HAVING THEM CHANGE
THEIR BEHAVIOR.
>> Shepard: SINCE THE COLD
WAR, WE HAVE NEVER TAKEN
SUCH A STANCE AS REGARDED TO
RUSSIA, HAVE WE?
>> NO.
THIS IS COMPLETELY NEW.
YOU KNOW, WE KICKED RUSSIA
OUT OF THE G-8 IN 2014.
AND THERE HAS JUST BEEN THIS
VIEW THAT, YOU KNOW, THEY
HAVEN'T CHANGED WHAT THEY
WERE DOING IN UKRAINE.
THEY HAVE BEEN VERY
AGGRESSIVE IN SYRIA.
YOU KNOW, WE HAD THIS
POISONING CASE IN GREAT
BRITAIN.
SO, YOU KNOW, THE ALLIES
WOULD SAY WHY WOULD YOU
ALLOW THEM TO COME BACK INTO
THIS GROUP WHEN THEY CLEARLY
HAVE BEEN DISRUPTIVE AROUND
THE WORLD.
>> Shepard: THEY ARE WIDELY
BELIEVED RESPONSIBLE FOR
SHOOTING DOWN COMMERCIAL
AIRLINER THAT LEFT 298
PEOPLE DEAD THERE IS A BIT
OF DISCONNECT THERE.
THE BIGGER PICTURE CONCERN
IS THAT THE RUSSIANS AREN'T
COMING BACK TO THE G-7.
THEY HAVE ALREADY SAID THEY
DON'T WANTING TO.
THE BIGGER PICTURE IS UNITED
STATES FINDS ITSELF
ISOLATED.
PRACTICALLY SPEAKING ONE
AGAINST SIX AT THIS
CONFERENCE.
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN FOR
RELATIONS?
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN
PRACTICALLY SPEAKING?
>> YEAH, I MEAN, THE
PRESIDENT AND HIS ALLIES
HAVE SAID THAT AMERICA FIRST
DOESN'T MEAN AMERICA ALONE.
BUT THAT THEORY IS GOING TO
BE TESTED AT THIS SUMMIT.
IT'S POSSIBLE THAT WE COULD
HAVE, YOU KNOW, AS KEVIN
MENTIONED, A COMMUNIQUE COME
DOWN THAT'S ONLY SIGNED BY
SIX OF THE SEVEN COUNTRIES,
NOT BY THE UNITED STATES.
>> Shepard: WHO CARES?
>> RIGHT.
EXACTLY.
>> Shepard: I MEAN, WHO WILL
CARE ABOUT THAT?
WHAT DOES THAT CHANGE?
THE CONCERN IS DOWN THE LINE
WHEN THERE IS A CRISIS ARE
YOUR ALLIES GOING TO BE WITH
YOU OR NOT?
THERE ARE A LOT OF PEOPLE
HERE IN THE STATES CONCERNED
ABOUT WHEN YOU ISOLATE
YOURSELF, WHEN YOU, YOU
KNOW, SLAP ON TARIFFS ON
ALLIES UNDER THE GUISE OF
NATIONAL SECURITY, THAT WHEN
YOU NEED HELP IN A CRISIS
DOWN THE ROAD, THOSE ALLIES
MAY NOT SUPPORT YOU.
>> WHO IS GOING TO THE
PRESIDENT TO ASK HIM TO
CHANGE HIS WAYS ON THIS
MATTER?
ANYBODY?
>> WELL, HAVE YOU SOME
REPUBLICANS ARE CERTAINLY
CONCERNED WITH THIS.
YOU KNOW, I THINK THERE IS
SOME ADVISORS WHO WOULD
PRIVATELY NOT LIKE, YOU
KNOW, THIS IDEA OF ALLOWING
RUSSIA BACK INTO THE G-7,
THE G-8.
>> Shepard: PRIVATELY, NO
ONE WANTS THEM BACK IN
EXCEPT MAYBE DANA
ROHRABACHER AND IT DOESN'T
MATTER WHAT HE THINKS.
>> THAT'S RIGHT.
THAT'S RIGHT.
BUT, YOU KNOW, THERE -- THE
QUESTION IS, I MEAN, I THINK
THE PRESIDENT SEES THIS AS
AN IMPORTANT VENUE TO HAVE
AN OPEN DISCUSSION TO HAVE
ALL THE IMPORTANT COUNTRIES
AT THE TABLE.
AND I THINK THAT WAS THE
POINT HE WAS MAKING.
BUT THERE ARE A LOT OF
PEOPLE WHO JUST SAY THAT,
YOU KNOW, WE ARE NOT THERE
YET.
WE SHOULD NOT ALLOW RUSSIA
IN.
>> Shepard: INDIA HAS A
BIGGER ECONOMY.
WHY DON'T YOU INVITE INDIA
