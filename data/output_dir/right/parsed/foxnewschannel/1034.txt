ELIZABETH: THE MUCH-ANTICIPATED
SUMMIT BETWEEN PRESIDENT TRUMP
AND DICTATOR KIM JONG UN MARKS A
MAJOR MILD TONE IN THE DIPLOMACY
ON THE KOREAN PENINSULA.
PRESIDENT TRUMP WERE TELLING
REPORTERS FRIDAY THAT ALL ISSUES
ON THE TABLE BETWEEN THE LEADERS
SCHEDULED FOR TUESDAY.
JOINING US NOW TO DISCUSS THE
POLITICAL IMPLICATIONS OF THE
JUNE 12 SUMMIT.
THANK YOU FOR JOINING US.
OBVIOUSLY IT'S HERE NOW,
APPROACHING QUICKLY.
I AM CURIOUS AS TO JUST YOUR
REACTION AS WE HEAD INTO THE
MEETINGS ON TUESDAY.
YOUR EXPECTATIONS FAMILIAR WITH
THE KOREAN PENINSULA.
THE DISCUSSION THAT WE'VE HAD IN
WEEKS PAST, CERTAINLY DIFFERENT
NOW BECAUSE THERE'S A MORE
PLEASANT TONE HEADING INTO
TUESDAY.
WHAT'S YOUR REACTION?
>> THIS IS A GOOD FIRST STEP.
I LISTEN TO THE RHETORIC THAT
THE PRESIDENT LOSES LEVERAGE A
FEW SHAKES HAND WITH KIM JONG
UN.
I THINK THE SUPREME LEADER WILL
LOSE LEVERAGE BY SHAKING HANDS
OF THE AMERICAN PRESIDENT
THREATENING A MILITARY ACTION IF
THIS FALLS APART, IF THIS
DOESN'T WORK.
LISTENING TO LINDSEY GRAHAM'S
WORDS ON KEEPING THE MILITARY
OPTION ALLIES.
THAT IS FIRED POWER IN ORDER TO
MAKE SMART POWER WORK.
THAT WAS CONVEYED TO KIM JONG UN
BY SECRETARY POMPEO IN HIS VISIT
BY NOW BUT IT LOOKS LIKE, WHAT
IT WOULD LOOK LIKE TO KIM JONG
UN IF WE TOOK THE OPTION.
>> SO OFTEN WE'VE HAD EXPERTS ON
THE SHOW TALK ABOUT WHAT THE
CONVERSATIONS SHOULD LOOK LIKE
WHEN THEY SAY THEY WANT COMPLETE
DENUCLEARIZATION.
DO THEY WANT A MEDIA?
DO THEY WANT TO BE PROGRESSIVE
AND HAVE U.S. FORCES OUT OF THE
PENINSULA?
IF THINGS DON'T GO ACCORDING TO
PLAN, WHAT IS THE BACKUP PLAN?
>> MAXIMUM PRESSURE.
ECONOMIC PRESSURE WITH THE
MILITARY OPTION ON THE TABLE.
NORTH KOREA WILL ONLY BE AS
STRONG AS CHINA AND RUSSIA ALLOW
IT TO BE OR BACK IT UP.
TAKING A CUE FROM THE DEMOCRATS,
AND THEY SAW HOW WE BE EVERY
INDIA WAS AN IEC DEMOCRAT THING
THERE SHOULD BE A COMPLETE
DISMANTLING OF THE NUCLEAR
PROGRAM AND NO INCENTIVES BEFORE
THEY'RE TAKEN BY THE SUPREME
LEADER AND NO SUNSET CLAUSES.
YOU ALMOST HAVE A UNITED FRONT
FOR THE FIRST-TIME MONONUCLEAR
PROGRAM.
DEMOCRATS AND REPUBLICANS WANT
TO BE TOUGH HERE IN NORTH KOREA
WHICH GIVES THE PRESIDENT
LEVERAGE.
>> WHERE AND HOW DOES CHINA PLAY
IN THAT?
WILL WE BE HEARING FROM THEM
THIS WEEK?
>> YOU SAW KEY MEETINGS TAKE
PLACE BETWEEN KIM JONG AHEAD OF
THE SUMMIT AND THAT IS TO GIVE
SOME LEVERAGE IN THESE MEETINGS.
IF THE PRESIDENT WALKS AWAY,
THAT IS NOT A BAD THING.
YOU CAN'T MAKE THESE
CONCESSIONS.
YOU CAN GIVE THEM WHAT THEY
WANTED.
THEY WANTED THE EVERY INDIA.
IF WE LOST AWAY FROM THE IRAN
DEAL COME WITH A BUS IN LEVERAGE
TO NORTH KOREA.
LELAND: ON THE HEELS OF THE G-7
SUMMIT, CONFIDENT, MORE
CONFIDENT, IMPACTFUL AT ALL?
IN THE G-7.
I DON'T UNDERSTAND WITHOUT
RUSSIA MAKING CONCESSIONS IN THE
AREA, HUMAN RIGHTS ISSUES IN
UKRAINE.
BUT I AM CANADA.
I UNDERSTAND BURKLE AND DEALING
WITH EUROPEAN ALLIES THERE.
BUT I DON'T THINK THAT FOR US IS
THE PRESIDENT GET A WIN WITH
NORTH KOREA MAKING CONCESSIONS
TO HAVE SOME DEAL TO BALANCE
WITH THE CRITICISM FROM THE G-7
SUMMIT.
>> FROM THEIR LIFE EXPERIENCES,
HOW SURPRISED WOULD YOU BE IF
THERE IS MAJOR PROGRESS THAT
HAPPENED ON TUESDAY?
>> I THINK THAT THERE'S NOT
MAJOR PROGRESS, CRITICS WILL SAY
THIS IS A FAILURE.
IT'S A GOOD THING FOR THE
PRESIDENT TO BE THERE.
THE MEETING IS TUESDAY.
THERE IS BREATH HAPPENING
TOMORROW AND THE PRESIDENT WILL
NOT HAVE THAT HANDSHAKE WITH KIM
JONG UN IF IT LOOKS ALL FOR SHOW
AND IS NOT SERIOUS ABOUT THIS.
I AM CAUTIOUSLY OPTIMISTIC, BUT
WHAT I WILL NOT DO WAS SUPPORT A
BAD NUCLEAR DEAL WITH NORTH
