in recent years this has become a recurring image the human cost of the refugee crisis in the film Eldorado we see the desperate journeys being undertaken for a better life from the moment of rescue clothes adrift to the start of the process that will bring them ashore in a country where some people do not want them and which puts them to work in jobs which pay little certainly that is the view the film's director wants the viewer to take the refugees hope that it is El Dorado that they will find paradise but somebody in the film says they are arriving in Purgatorio and the theme of migration is prominent in several films at this year's festival where collectively the different aspects of adapting to difficult circumstances are laid bare and where we see the individual human stories of failure and success as in the film Supra which tells the story of Miriam char a stateless refugee in Lebanon who forms a catering company with friends in the board and virajna camp south of beirut most of them wished for something related to cooking because they're good at cooking and it's something they do daily in the film we see their struggles to build their business and how their efforts help to heal the wounds of war sofra has been brought to the screen by Thomas Morgan he told me why he felt this was a story he had to direct the fact that it was women and taking their dignity and their power back and having this this unbelievable will to finish but I've always told stories of like underdog stories so it's always people who face you know incredible odds and their lives and what they're doing in so I think Miriam really in doing this not just for herself but for our entire community really embraced this opportunity the Berlin Film Festival will soon be drawing to a close but the issues many of its films have highlighted will not dominate claim al-jazeera Berlin
