WOMEN, FEMALE, UNEMPLOYMENT,
LOWEST LEVEL IN 18 YEARS.
JESSE: JOINING ME NOW
COMMUNICATIONS DIRECTOR FOR
TURNING POINT U.S.A. AND NEW
STAR IN AMERICA CANDACE OWENS.
HE SPOKE ABOUT UNEMPLOYMENT
BEING AT RECORD LOW AND TALKED
ABOUT HIS NEW FRIEND KANYE WEST.
DO YOU THINK KANYE IS THROWING
HIS SUPPORT BEHIND PRESIDENT
TRUMP BECAUSE OF HIS ECONOMIC
POLICIES FOR BLACK AMERICA?
>> FOR SURE.
I THINK WHAT KANYE WEST IS DOING
IS ASSESSING THE CONTINUES
BETWEEN HOW BLACK AMERICA IS
DOING NOW VERSUS HOW IT WAS
DOING UNDER OBAMA'S
ADMINISTRATION.
WE KNOW THAT KANYE HAS
PARTICULARLY CARED A LOT ABOUT
CHICAGO AND ITS COMMUNITY AND
WHAT'S BEEN GOING ON OVER THERE
BECAUSE THAT'S WHERE HE'S FROM.
THEY ARE DOING BETTER UNDER THIS
ADMINISTRATION.
SO I'M EXCITED TO SEE WHERE
BLACK AMERICA IS GOING TO HEAD
AND EXCITED THAT KANYE WEST
JUMPED ON BOARD FULLY AND HE
SEEMS TO BE DOUBLE DOWN AND
TRIPLING DOWN WITH HIS SUPPORT.
JESSE: BLACK AMERICA, 90% VOTES
DEMOCRATS.
WHITES ARE EVENLY SPLIT.
ASIANS 60-30.
WHY DO YOU THINK AS A BLACK
WOMAN IN AMERICA THAT THERE IS
UP A MONOLITHIC GROUP THAT
SUPPORTS THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY IN
AMERICA.
>> IT'S SIMPLE.
I COME FROM THE LEFT I WAS A
LIBERAL.
IT HAS TO DO WITH THE
EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM.
WE LEARN THAT LBJ WAS THE
GREATEST PRESIDENT FOR BLACK
AMERICA AND THAT COULDN'T BE
MORE FALSE.
WHAT HE DID IS EVEN SLAVE US
WITH THE GREAT SO -- WHAT HE DID
WAS ENSLAVE US WITH THE GREAT
SOCIETY.
OUR FATHERS ARE NOT IN OUR HOMES
BECAUSE THAT WAS I SEASON
TOUGHIZED BY LBJ'S GREAT SOCIETY
ACT.
THEY HAVE ALL OF US VOTING FOR
THEM FOR ALL THE WRONG REASONS.
WE DON'T UNDERSTAND OUR HISTORY
AND DON'T UNDERSTAND THE
ECONOMIC POLICIES BEHIND IT.
JESSE: YOU THINK THE EDUCATION
SYSTEM IN OUR COUNTRY TEACHES
AMERICA THAT THE BIG GOVERNMENT
POLICIES STARTED UNDER LBJ ARE
GOOD FOR THEM, BUT YOU ARE
SAYING THOSE GOVERNMENT POLICIES
HAVE MAYBE STIFLED THE GROWTH OF
BLACK AMERICA.
>> IT'S NOT A MATTER OF OPINION.
IT'S A MATTER OF FACT.
I CAME UP IN THE PUBLIC SCHOOL
EDUCATION.
WE ALSO LEARNED, THE REPUBLICAN
PARTY IS VIRTUALLY DEMONIZED IN
OUR TEXTBOOKS.
MOST OF BLACKS BELIEVE THE
REPUBLICAN AND DEMOCRATIC
PARTIES SWITCHED IN THE 1970s
SWITCHED.
THAT'S A MYTH.
IT NEVER HAPPENED.
SOMETHING CALLED THE SOUTHERN
STRATEGY.
THEY ARE LEARNING TO BE IGNORANT
IN THE SCHOOL SYSTEM AND ONCE
AGAIN AT HOME VIA CULTURE.
THEY ARE IDOLIZING PEOPLE WHO
ARE NOT TELLING THEM ACCURATELY
WHAT'S GOING ON IN OUR
COUNTRIES.
JESSE: I KNOW WHEN I HIT THE
STREETS AND YOU ASK PEOPLE IF
ABRAHAM LINCOLN WAS A REPUBLICAN
