1
00:00:02,501 --> 00:00:03,535
>> Trish: HERE NOW

2
00:00:03,535 --> 00:00:07,039
DEMOCRATIC CONGRESSMAN ERIC

3
00:00:07,039 --> 00:00:07,773
SWALLOW OF CALIFORNIA.

4
00:00:07,773 --> 00:00:08,707
GOOD TO HAVE YOU.

5
00:00:08,707 --> 00:00:09,241
>> GOOD EVENING.

6
00:00:09,241 --> 00:00:10,175
>> Trish: WHAT IS YOUR

7
00:00:10,175 --> 00:00:11,377
REACTION TO ALL THIS?

8
00:00:11,377 --> 00:00:12,277
>> WELL, I UNDERSTAND THAT

9
00:00:12,277 --> 00:00:13,045
THERE ARE POLITICAL

10
00:00:13,045 --> 00:00:14,880
CONSEQUENCES BUT I DON'T KNOW

11
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:16,047
THE SENATOR IS SUGGESTING THE

12
00:00:16,047 --> 00:00:18,784
COST OF LOSING AN ELECTION IS

13
00:00:18,784 --> 00:00:20,219
TO PUT ON A SUPREME COURT

14
00:00:20,219 --> 00:00:21,954
SOMEONE WHO HAS SERIOUS

15
00:00:21,954 --> 00:00:22,755
ALLEGATIONS GENG HIM WHERE

16
00:00:22,755 --> 00:00:25,324
THERE ARE STILL QUESTIONS AND

17
00:00:25,324 --> 00:00:26,525
ASTERISKS ON THE NOMINATION.

18
00:00:26,525 --> 00:00:27,993
THE RESPONSIBLE THING TO DO IS

19
00:00:27,993 --> 00:00:29,528
PUT TO BED ALL OF THOSE

20
00:00:29,528 --> 00:00:30,195
ALLEGATIONS.

21
00:00:30,195 --> 00:00:35,167
>> Trish: CONGRESSMAN, I

22
00:00:35,167 --> 00:00:36,602
HEAR YOU BUT I WANT TO GO BACK

23
00:00:36,602 --> 00:00:37,803
TO WHY WE DIDN'T KNOW THIS

24
00:00:37,803 --> 00:00:38,170
EARLIER.

25
00:00:38,170 --> 00:00:40,272
WE TALKED TO OUR POLLSTER WHO

26
00:00:40,272 --> 00:00:41,574
TOLD US LOOK, THE INDEPENDENTS

27
00:00:41,574 --> 00:00:44,143
ARE FED UP WITH THIS.

28
00:00:44,143 --> 00:00:45,578
THEY BLAME BOTH SIDES AND THEY

29
00:00:45,578 --> 00:00:47,012
DON'T LIKE THAT IT GOT TO THIS

30
00:00:47,012 --> 00:00:47,313
POINT.

31
00:00:47,313 --> 00:00:48,681
THEY DIDN'T THINK IT WAS FAIR

32
00:00:48,681 --> 00:00:49,582
TO JUDGE KAVANAUGH.

33
00:00:49,582 --> 00:00:50,983
THEY DIDN'T THINK IT WAS FAIR

34
00:00:50,983 --> 00:00:51,550
TO DR. FORD.

35
00:00:51,550 --> 00:00:52,718
I WOULD TELL YOU IT WASN'T

36
00:00:52,718 --> 00:00:53,919
FAIR TO THE COUNTRY TO SEE

37
00:00:53,919 --> 00:00:54,253
THAT.

38
00:00:54,253 --> 00:00:55,454
AND IT COULD HAVE BEEN

39
00:00:55,454 --> 00:00:56,355
PREVENTED HAD THE DEMOCRATS

40
00:00:56,355 --> 00:00:59,725
WHO HAD THE INFORMATION FROM

41
00:00:59,725 --> 00:01:01,794
DR. FORD COME FORWARD AND TOLD

42
00:01:01,794 --> 00:01:02,962
OUR PRESIDENT SO THE PROCESS

43
00:01:02,962 --> 00:01:04,629
COULD HAVE BEEN I DON'T KNOW,

44
00:01:04,629 --> 00:01:07,133
COMPREHENSIVE WHEN THEY DID

45
00:01:07,133 --> 00:01:07,933
THIS INVESTIGATION.

46
00:01:07,933 --> 00:01:09,268
SO THAT AT LEAST PEOPLE WOULD

47
00:01:09,268 --> 00:01:10,302
HAVE KNOWN ABOUT IT AND IT

48
00:01:10,302 --> 00:01:11,704
WOULDN'T HAVE HAD TO PLAY OUT

49
00:01:11,704 --> 00:01:12,972
ON NATIONAL TV LIKE IT DID.

50
00:01:12,972 --> 00:01:14,173
HOW COME IT DIDN'T?

51
00:01:14,173 --> 00:01:14,507
>> YEAH.

52
00:01:14,507 --> 00:01:15,641
I HEAR THAT CONCERN.

53
00:01:15,641 --> 00:01:16,742
I'LL SAY THIS.

54
00:01:16,742 --> 00:01:17,943
AS SOMEONE WHO WORKED WITH

55
00:01:17,943 --> 00:01:20,146
SEXUAL ASSAULT VICTIMS AS

56
00:01:20,146 --> 00:01:21,681
PROSECUTOR, EVERY VICTIM COMES

57
00:01:21,681 --> 00:01:23,049
FORWARD OR DOESN'T COME

58
00:01:23,049 --> 00:01:25,217
FORWARD AT ALL IN A DIFFERENT

59
00:01:25,217 --> 00:01:25,551
MANNER.

60
00:01:25,551 --> 00:01:27,019
I GUESS YOU WOULD ASK --

61
00:01:27,019 --> 00:01:28,220
>> Trish: BUT SHE DID COME

62
00:01:28,220 --> 00:01:28,587
FORWARD.

63
00:01:28,587 --> 00:01:30,189
SHE DIDN'T WANT TO BE EXPOSED.

64
00:01:30,189 --> 00:01:31,724
SHE DIDN'T WANT HER IDENTITY

65
00:01:31,724 --> 00:01:32,091
LEAKED.

66
00:01:32,091 --> 00:01:35,561
SHE CAME FORWARD AND IT WAS

67
00:01:35,561 --> 00:01:36,896
FEINSTEIN WHO KNEW ABOUT THIS,

68
00:01:36,896 --> 00:01:37,897
HER CONGRESSWOMAN WHO KNEW

69
00:01:37,897 --> 00:01:38,631
ABOUT IT.

70
00:01:38,631 --> 00:01:39,965
DON'T FORGET, CONGRESSMAN, SHE

71
00:01:39,965 --> 00:01:41,634
TRIED TO ALERT PEOPLE.

72
00:01:41,634 --> 00:01:41,967
RIGHT?

73
00:01:41,967 --> 00:01:45,004
SHE ALERTED THE "WASHINGTON

74
00:01:45,004 --> 00:01:46,238
POST" AND ALERTED THE

75
00:01:46,238 --> 00:01:46,906
CONGRESSWOMAN'S OFFICE AND

76
00:01:46,906 --> 00:01:48,541
SENT A LETTER AND SPOKE TO THE

77
00:01:48,541 --> 00:01:48,974
RECEPTIONIST.

78
00:01:48,974 --> 00:01:50,376
SHE WAS TRYING TO GET THE WORD

79
00:01:50,376 --> 00:01:51,844
OUT BEHIND THE SCENES.

80
00:01:51,844 --> 00:01:52,945
NOBODY CARED.

81
00:01:52,945 --> 00:01:54,547
NOT UNTIL HE WAS NAMED.

82
00:01:54,547 --> 00:01:55,715
>> PEOPLE CERTAINLY CARED BUT

83
00:01:55,715 --> 00:01:56,382
I'D SAY THIS.

84
00:01:56,382 --> 00:01:58,284
WOULD YOU PREFER SHE NEVER HAD

85
00:01:58,284 --> 00:02:00,119
COME FORWARD AT ALL IF IT WAS

86
00:02:00,119 --> 00:02:00,486
TRUE?

87
00:02:00,486 --> 00:02:01,387
SHE CAME FORWARD.

88
00:02:01,387 --> 00:02:02,788
ONCE SHE DID THE PAST IS THE

89
00:02:02,788 --> 00:02:03,856
PAST WE SHOULD TAKE HER

90
00:02:03,856 --> 00:02:05,057
ALLEGATION SERIOUSLY.

91
00:02:05,057 --> 00:02:06,526
>> YOU CAN UNDERSTAND WHY THE

92
00:02:06,526 --> 00:02:07,293
REPUBLICANS AREN'T TRUSTING

93
00:02:07,293 --> 00:02:08,561
YOU GUYS, RIGHT?

94
00:02:08,561 --> 00:02:09,294
>> BUT I SAY THIS.

95
00:02:09,294 --> 00:02:12,432
I MADE THIS ARGUMENT TO MANY

96
00:02:12,432 --> 00:02:16,102
JUROR -- TO MANY JURIES.

97
00:02:16,102 --> 00:02:17,870
WHAT ARE THE CHANCES THAT THIS

98
00:02:17,870 --> 00:02:19,105
WOMAN AND TWO OTHER WOMEN WHO

99
00:02:19,105 --> 00:02:20,840
NEVER MET EACH OTHER COME

100
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:22,342
FORWARD WITH SIMILAR

101
00:02:22,342 --> 00:02:23,042
ACCUSATIONS?

102
00:02:23,042 --> 00:02:23,643
IT'S UNLIKELY.

103
00:02:23,643 --> 00:02:25,378
I COULD BE THAT HE IS

104
00:02:25,378 --> 00:02:26,346
UNLUCKIEST PERSON IN THE WORLD

105
00:02:26,346 --> 00:02:27,313
BUT HE SHOULD INVESTIGATE.

106
00:02:27,313 --> 00:02:28,281
>> Trish: I DON'T KNOW WHAT

107
00:02:28,281 --> 00:02:28,948
IT COULD BE.

108
00:02:28,948 --> 00:02:29,582
ANYTHING, RIGHT?

109
00:02:29,582 --> 00:02:31,050
WE START SPECULATING LIKE THAT

110
00:02:31,050 --> 00:02:32,518
IT GETS --

111
00:02:32,518 --> 00:02:33,286
>> THAT'S WHY WE INVESTIGATE.

112
00:02:33,286 --> 00:02:34,354
THAT IS WHY WE INVESTIGATE.

113
00:02:34,354 --> 00:02:36,255
>> Trish: I WANT TO ASK YOU

114
00:02:36,255 --> 00:02:36,756
ABOUT THIS.

115
00:02:36,756 --> 00:02:38,558
KAMALA HARRIS HAD BASICALLY

116
00:02:38,558 --> 00:02:39,659
WASHED HER HANDS OF THE WHOLE

117
00:02:39,659 --> 00:02:40,026
SITUATION.

118
00:02:40,026 --> 00:02:41,294
AND I WANT YOUR REACTION.

119
00:02:41,294 --> 00:02:43,296
PLAY IT FOR THE VIEWERS.

120
00:02:43,296 --> 00:02:44,497
>> THIS IS A SHAM WHAT IS

121
00:02:44,497 --> 00:02:50,603
GOING ON IN THERE RIGHT NOW.

122
00:02:50,603 --> 00:02:51,404
>> DEMOCRATS ARE NOT HEARD.

123
00:02:51,404 --> 00:02:53,039
THEY ARE PUSHING THROUGH THE

124
00:02:53,039 --> 00:02:53,406
PROCESS.

125
00:02:53,406 --> 00:02:54,741
THE STATEMENTS YESTERDAY WERE

126
00:02:54,741 --> 00:02:56,276
ABOUT BULLYING THE FELLOW

127
00:02:56,276 --> 00:02:56,643
SENATORS.

128
00:02:56,643 --> 00:02:58,011
FROM TOP TO BOTTOM, THIS HAS

129
00:02:58,011 --> 00:03:00,314
BEEN ABOUT BULLIES.

130
00:03:00,314 --> 00:03:01,648
>> Trish: I SHOULD POINT OUT

131
00:03:01,648 --> 00:03:04,818
SHE DID STORM OUT OF THE

132
00:03:04,818 --> 00:03:05,185
SESSION.

133
00:03:05,185 --> 00:03:05,886
SHE WAS DONE.

134
00:03:05,886 --> 00:03:07,421
SHE WASHED HER HANDS OF IT AND

135
00:03:07,421 --> 00:03:09,923
SHE WAS DONE AND GOT OUT THERE

136
00:03:09,923 --> 00:03:10,958
AND FED THAT INFORMATION TO

137
00:03:10,958 --> 00:03:12,793
THE REPORTERS AND THE CAMERAS.

138
00:03:12,793 --> 00:03:15,362
I WOULD POINT OUT, CONGRESSMAN

139
00:03:15,362 --> 00:03:16,597
THAT YESTERDAY, SHE DIDN'T

140
00:03:16,597 --> 00:03:18,866
LEAVE A WHOLE LOT OF TIME FOR

141
00:03:18,866 --> 00:03:21,435
DR. FORD TO TALK.

142
00:03:21,435 --> 00:03:22,903
SHE SPOKE AND SPOKE AND SPOKE

143
00:03:22,903 --> 00:03:24,504
ABOUT HOW AWFUL THIS WAS AND

144
00:03:24,504 --> 00:03:25,606
HOW SHE BELIEVED HER AND

145
00:03:25,606 --> 00:03:26,740
SOMEHOW IT'S THE PRESIDENT'S

146
00:03:26,740 --> 00:03:27,140
FAULT.

147
00:03:27,140 --> 00:03:31,178
IT WAS GRANDSTANDING IN A WAY

148
00:03:31,178 --> 00:03:36,650
THAT FRANKLY WAS NOT

149
00:03:36,650 --> 00:03:37,517
BENEFICIAL TO ANYONE INCLUDING

150
00:03:37,517 --> 00:03:37,851
HER.

151
00:03:37,851 --> 00:03:39,553
WHY IS THE PARTY LIKE THAT

152
00:03:39,553 --> 00:03:39,887
NOW?

153
00:03:39,887 --> 00:03:40,988
>> WE COME FROM THE SAME

154
00:03:40,988 --> 00:03:41,688
DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S OFFICE.

155
00:03:41,688 --> 00:03:43,257
I WOULD SAY I WOULD HAVE BEEN

156
00:03:43,257 --> 00:03:43,891
UPSET, TOO.

157
00:03:43,891 --> 00:03:45,125
RIGHT BEFORE SHE WALKED OUT

158
00:03:45,125 --> 00:03:47,227
THEY MOVED TO SUBPOENA MARK

159
00:03:47,227 --> 00:03:48,962
JUDGE.

160
00:03:48,962 --> 00:03:50,230
THE ALIBI WITNESS FOR JUDGE

161
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:50,664
KAVANAUGH.

162
00:03:50,664 --> 00:03:52,299
I DON'T KNOW WHY YOU WOULDN'T

163
00:03:52,299 --> 00:03:53,533
WANT TO HEAR FROM THAT PERSON

164
00:03:53,533 --> 00:03:55,602
AND PUT HIM UNDER OATH AS YOU

165
00:03:55,602 --> 00:03:57,137
PUT DR. FORD UNDER OATH.

166
00:03:57,137 --> 00:03:58,205
I WILL SAY THIS, TRISH.

167
00:03:58,205 --> 00:04:00,407
27 YEARS AGO WHEN ANITA HILL

168
00:04:00,407 --> 00:04:01,608
CAME FORWARD MOST PEOPLE AGREE

169
00:04:01,608 --> 00:04:02,576
IT WAS A DISGRACE.

170
00:04:02,576 --> 00:04:04,111
BUT 20 WITNESSES WERE HEARD AT

171
00:04:04,111 --> 00:04:05,178
THAT HEARING.

172
00:04:05,178 --> 00:04:07,514
WE HAVE ACTUALLY GONE BACKWARD

173
00:04:07,514 --> 00:04:08,415
WHEN ONLY TWO WITNESSES ARE

174
00:04:08,415 --> 00:04:09,950
HEARD AND THEY PUT FORWARD THE

175
00:04:09,950 --> 00:04:10,851
NOMINATION WITHOUT CONSIDERING

176
00:04:10,851 --> 00:04:16,623
ANY OTHER EVIDENCE.

177
00:04:16,623 --> 00:04:18,024
>> SO YOU THINK HE IS LYING?

178
00:04:18,024 --> 00:04:19,993
>> I WOULDN'T HIRE HIM BUT I'D

179
00:04:19,993 --> 00:04:20,726
LOOK MORE INTO THIS.

180
00:04:20,726 --> 00:04:21,661
>> Trish: SORRY, YOU

181
00:04:21,661 --> 00:04:22,696
WOULDN'T HIRE HIM?

182
00:04:22,696 --> 00:04:23,897
>> THIS IS A JOB INTERVIEW.

183
00:04:23,897 --> 00:04:25,966
THEY ARE ADVISING AND

184
00:04:25,966 --> 00:04:26,867
CONSENTING AND ESSENTIALLY

185
00:04:26,867 --> 00:04:28,235
HIRING OR NOT HIRING JUDGE

186
00:04:28,235 --> 00:04:28,802
KAVANAUGH.

187
00:04:28,802 --> 00:04:29,937
I'M NOT DETERMINING WHETHER HE

188
00:04:29,937 --> 00:04:30,704
DID THIS OR NOT.

189
00:04:30,704 --> 00:04:31,638
I WOULD SAY --

190
00:04:31,638 --> 00:04:32,506
>> Trish: NOR AM I.

191
00:04:32,506 --> 00:04:34,508
BUT DO YOU THINK IT'S FAIR

192
