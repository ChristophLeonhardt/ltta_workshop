a dirty coal miner and that's exactly
how they look have fun with mama

ya hang on little snowball snowball did
a little jerk did a little jerk you
can't get it hey guys we are about
Brittany and I thanks for driving
so something absolutely incredibly
insane it was supposed to happen today
it still might but I don't know I don't
know if it's gonna happen I told you in
yesterday's vlog something crazy was
happening today and I mean crazy like
you guys aren't gonna believe that swear
I'm not even gonna tell you it's what
happens right and I waited all day to
vlog so that the vlog would just be
about that but now I have to start the
vlog because we run out of time and
yeah we're you we're gonna go out
tumbleweed how was it guys 10 out of 10
we haven't been here for a long time can
I get the door for you you guys got that
my screen is nasty
my lens you guys got to see some of
these drinks leave this
let me let me let me steal this for a
set pop rocks in a shot glass gummy
worms well looks like I'm driving yep I
had so many waters though gonna make it
need help you need some assistance yes

I'm a gentleman okay it looks cute toy
bite your hand off
look he wants it he wants my hand see
you know what I was gonna buy one but I
just can't split them up
Zeus would have so much fun with him it
looks like you just pick him up and like
wash the floor with him look let's grab
him and just wash he's trying to prove
you he won't tear anything up no you
know I always felt so bad that he's
fished my whole life the ones that just
sit in these cups literally don't swim
anywhere but they're so pretty
so the reason we actually came here is
the Zeus's birthday and we want to come
get him something cool but I don't know
what he's got everything
oh yeah your mom would love that promise
this is he tears up everything instantly
so it's almost got to be tennis balls or
something super solid like a Kong and he
doesn't like the Kong so so this is the
worst best point this is Lucy's favorite
toy in the world right here that's it
it's a family favorite and we we um
we've got them several of these some of
them two right in half and some he can't
chew him so it's kind of luck I don't
