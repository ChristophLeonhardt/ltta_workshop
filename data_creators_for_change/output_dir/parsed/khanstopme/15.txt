- ALS currently has no cure.
It's a degenerative disease.
That means that you slowly
lose control of your muscles.
For the pharmaceutical industry
the disease isn't profitable,
which means that investors
have no incentive
to invest money into the research of ALS.
This is why donations to
the cause is important.
In the UK, all you need to
do is text ICED55 to 70070.
Raising awareness is also important,
because we have the power
to help these people,
and the Ice Bucket
Challenge is also important,
but only if you donate.
Let's do this!
