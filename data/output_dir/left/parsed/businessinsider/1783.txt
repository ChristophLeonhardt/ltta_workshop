it takes about five minutes
for a church bell to ring 49 times
I know this because last month my son
Christopher his boyfriend Juan and 47
others were murdered at a club in
Orlando Christopher was my only child as
I used to tell him you can't do better
than perfect
you have so many friends to appear two
of whom are here tonight representing
hundreds and hundreds more all his life
he brought people together in high
school he won the Anne Frank
Humanitarian Award for starting the
gay-straight Alliance
Christopher's paternal grandparents met
and fell in love in a Japanese
internment camp so it was in his DNA
that love always Trump's hate
Christopher Christopher was a big
hillary supporter that's why I'm here so
that i can tell you about the day he was
born at the time i was a michigan state
trooper when I went into labor the
hospital put my off-duty gun in a safe I
didn't argue I no common sense gun
policies save lives
the weapon that murdered my son fires 30
rounds in one minute an orlando city
commissioner pointed out the terrible
math one minute for a gun to fire so
many shots five minutes rebelled to
honor so many lives I'm glad
common-sense gun policy was in place the
day Christopher was born but where was
that common sense the day he died
I never want you to ask that question
about your child that's why I support
Hillary Clinton
you
