Breaking news, North Korea
threatening to take action.
There's a threat of a
strike against Guam.
--with a threat to attack Guam.
--on the US territory of Guam.
And as I said.
They will be met
with fire, fury,
and frankly power the likes of
which this world has never seen
before.
Well, the North Korean missile
capability can point in many
directions.
So Guam is not the only place
that could be under threat.
I do not believe that there
is any imminent threat,
in my own view.
