again she would have<font color="#CCCCCC"> already won the</font>

16
00:00:31,270 --> 00:00:33,100

00:00:44,410 --> 00:00:46,089
especially at<font color="#E5E5E5"> times when she was trying</font>

24
00:00:46,089 --> 00:00:48,309
to go to him and bait him and insult him

25
00:00:48,309 --> 00:00:50,140
she made it very personal and<font color="#CCCCCC"> in a</font>

26
00:00:50,140 --> 00:00:52,510
couple places very personal and he did
