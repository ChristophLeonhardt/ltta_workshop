00:00:12,530 --> 00:00:14,660
welcome to TV I live

00:00:14,660 --> 00:00:16,450
Leonard with us today Scott Walker

00:00:16,450 --> 00:00:19,160
co-founder and president of brain candy

4
00:00:19,160 --> 00:00:21,710
first of all what is brain candy brain

5
00:00:21,710 --> 00:00:23,599
candy is a company that has developed<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

6
00:00:23,599 --> 00:00:25,580
model to help entertainment commercial

7
00:00:25,580 --> 00:00:27,080
property owners figure out ways to

8
00:00:27,080 --> 00:00:28,849
better monetize and market their

9
00:00:28,849 --> 00:00:30,619
properties it does it in a way<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

10
00:00:30,619 --> 00:00:32,418
opens<font color="#E5E5E5"> up the property to a collaborative</font>

11
00:00:32,418 --> 00:00:34,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">process where fans and the creative</font>

12
00:00:34,970 --> 00:00:36,350
community at large could come in and

13
00:00:36,350 --> 00:00:38,600
meaningfully participate in co-creating

14
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:40,190
value and content under<font color="#E5E5E5"> that particular</font>

15
00:00:40,190 --> 00:00:42,320
property now your company talks a lot

16
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:44,930
about transmedia what is transmedia what

17
00:00:44,930 --> 00:00:47,059
<font color="#CCCCCC">did that word mean that would depend on</font>

18
00:00:47,059 --> 00:00:49,370
who you ask technically the term was

19
00:00:49,370 --> 00:00:51,260
coined by dr. Henry Jenkins who was

20
00:00:51,260 --> 00:00:53,140
currently<font color="#CCCCCC"> a professor at USC</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> School of</font>

21
00:00:53,140 --> 00:00:54,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">Communication hannover School of</font>

22
00:00:54,710 --> 00:00:57,079
<font color="#E5E5E5">Communication and he coined the term</font>

23
00:00:57,079 --> 00:00:59,360
years ago to refer to<font color="#CCCCCC"> that the act of</font>

24
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:01,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">creating multiple narratives across</font>

25
00:01:01,190 --> 00:01:03,890
multiple mediums<font color="#CCCCCC"> that contributes you</font>

26
00:01:03,890 --> 00:01:05,810
the story as a whole so<font color="#CCCCCC"> you would have</font>

27
00:01:05,810 --> 00:01:08,000
storylines and characters across comic

28
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,340
books for example novels movies etc all

29
00:01:10,340 --> 00:01:12,440
within the same world but contributing

30
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:13,850
to that world narrative in a meaningful

31
00:01:13,850 --> 00:01:17,030
way so if I'm a studio or even<font color="#E5E5E5"> a writer</font>

32
00:01:17,030 --> 00:01:19,610
opening up my content to other people is

33
00:01:19,610 --> 00:01:21,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">kind of scary I mean what are</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

34
00:01:21,770 --> 00:01:23,569
extensions where this model is<font color="#CCCCCC"> going to</font>

35
00:01:23,569 --> 00:01:26,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">work in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that framework it can be applied</font>

36
00:01:26,810 --> 00:01:29,240
several ways one would be for example to

37
00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:30,920
take a dormant piece of intellectual

38
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:32,240
property that has been sitting<font color="#E5E5E5"> around</font>

39
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:34,670
for 10<font color="#CCCCCC"> or 15 years it's not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> being worked</font>

40
00:01:34,670 --> 00:01:36,950
on its not being monetized actively and

41
00:01:36,950 --> 00:01:40,160
friends friends for example or a 1980s

42
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:42,830
TV show or say<font color="#CCCCCC"> the buck rogers franchise</font>

43
00:01:42,830 --> 00:01:44,750
for example where that's currently going

44
00:01:44,750 --> 00:01:46,520
through a reboot process and say we're

45
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:47,810
going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> open this up</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to an install</font>

46
00:01:47,810 --> 00:01:49,190
customer base because there are already

47
00:01:49,190 --> 00:01:50,899
fans out there who love the property but

48
00:01:50,899 --> 00:01:52,369
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to participate in a way that goes</font>

49
00:01:52,369 --> 00:01:54,950
beyond passive consumption so what we do

50
00:01:54,950 --> 00:01:56,330
is say we can work with the

51
00:01:56,330 --> 00:01:57,770
entertainment property owner and say

52
00:01:57,770 --> 00:01:59,959
open it up this way here's the strategy

53
00:01:59,959 --> 00:02:01,970
allow them to play with it this<font color="#E5E5E5"> way that</font>

54
00:02:01,970 --> 00:02:03,349
way don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> let them play with it this way</font>

55
00:02:03,349 --> 00:02:06,110
<font color="#CCCCCC">that way that way you retain editorial</font>

56
00:02:06,110 --> 00:02:08,119
and brandy control and yet the creative

57
00:02:08,119 --> 00:02:09,919
community has a very flexible way to

58
00:02:09,919 --> 00:02:12,080
engage collaboratively and meaningfully

59
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:13,540
with the property they're basically

60
00:02:13,540 --> 00:02:15,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">co-creating valium console with the</font>

61
00:02:15,530 --> 00:02:17,840
owner and that's key so it's engaging

62
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:19,670
the user that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> already there correct</font>

63
00:02:19,670 --> 00:02:22,310
and then they will there will<font color="#CCCCCC"> be revenue</font>

64
00:02:22,310 --> 00:02:22,780
as

65
00:02:22,780 --> 00:02:24,700
down the<font color="#CCCCCC"> line we monetize that</font>

66
00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:27,550
aggregated audience absolutely so the

67
00:02:27,550 --> 00:02:28,600
property owner could look at it<font color="#E5E5E5"> from</font>

68
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:30,640
pure marketing perspective and say it's

69
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:32,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to be a cost Center and they can</font>

70
00:02:32,740 --> 00:02:34,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">open it up and say well let you post</font>

71
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:36,430
your content here however the property

72
00:02:36,430 --> 00:02:38,170
owner could also monetize it and say

73
00:02:38,170 --> 00:02:39,910
here's all this content that's coming in

74
00:02:39,910 --> 00:02:41,290
or it's already being generated by the

75
00:02:41,290 --> 00:02:43,480
user community around our property let's

76
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:44,920
find<font color="#E5E5E5"> a way to integrate that and</font>

77
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:46,390
constructively put that into the

78
00:02:46,390 --> 00:02:48,489
property either as official can and

79
00:02:48,489 --> 00:02:50,950
content and or as a way<font color="#CCCCCC"> to monetize it</font>

80
00:02:50,950 --> 00:02:52,959
so that both the creator of the content

81
00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:54,489
<font color="#E5E5E5">and the property owner can monetize that</font>

82
00:02:54,489 --> 00:02:55,989
content and creative and when you see

83
00:02:55,989 --> 00:02:57,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">cannon content that's content that's</font>

84
00:02:57,700 --> 00:03:00,010
recognized by the IP owner as official

85
00:03:00,010 --> 00:03:01,720
as a panel as opposed to something that

86
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:03,430
is generated within the world but they

87
00:03:03,430 --> 00:03:05,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">deem not part of the property gotcha so</font>

88
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:07,720
what's next for<font color="#E5E5E5"> brain candy what do you</font>

89
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:09,700
see down the line in the next 5-10 years

90
00:03:09,700 --> 00:03:11,530
obviously this is sort of a

91
00:03:11,530 --> 00:03:13,870
revolutionary<font color="#E5E5E5"> new</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> way to think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about how</font>

92
00:03:13,870 --> 00:03:15,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">to aggregate audiences and monetize that</font>

93
00:03:15,730 --> 00:03:18,970
and where is<font color="#E5E5E5"> this going down the line</font>

94
00:03:18,970 --> 00:03:20,980
well one thing for sure is that we<font color="#E5E5E5"> want</font>

95
00:03:20,980 --> 00:03:22,120
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> continue</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to get the word out about</font>

96
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:23,709
the fact that new models of

97
00:03:23,709 --> 00:03:25,510
collaboration are going to allow current

98
00:03:25,510 --> 00:03:27,459
property owners to find new ways to make

99
00:03:27,459 --> 00:03:29,290
money as well as advertised their

100
00:03:29,290 --> 00:03:31,510
property<font color="#CCCCCC"> user-generated</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> content is just</font>

101
00:03:31,510 --> 00:03:33,220
increasing at an exponential rate and

102
00:03:33,220 --> 00:03:35,829
with users having far more choices about

103
00:03:35,829 --> 00:03:38,260
what to consume where to consume it what

104
00:03:38,260 --> 00:03:39,790
properties want to do is be<font color="#CCCCCC"> able to get</font>

105
00:03:39,790 --> 00:03:42,100
their property out<font color="#CCCCCC"> in front and one way</font>

106
00:03:42,100 --> 00:03:43,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">to do that in to gain attention is to</font>

107
00:03:43,630 --> 00:03:45,910
allow<font color="#E5E5E5"> the fans to play with the property</font>

108
00:03:45,910 --> 00:03:46,930
in a way that doesn't sacrifice

109
00:03:46,930 --> 00:03:48,850
editorial control and doesn't sacrifice

110
00:03:48,850 --> 00:03:50,320
commercial rights for the property owner

111
00:03:50,320 --> 00:00:00,000
