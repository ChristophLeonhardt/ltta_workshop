a woman by the name of Sylvia Costa is speaking out after she returned to the United States from her trip in Europe she and her daughter were going through customs and when they were speaking to an agent in customs the agent wanted to know why she and her daughter didn't share the same last name and so Sylvia posted about this on her Facebook page and said I was asked if Cibona was my daughter and I said yes then they asked why if she was my daughter I didn't have the same last name I told him I already established my career and earned my doctorate with my last name Acosta and I had decided not to change it so at that point they apparently took her and her daughter into an interrogation room and started interrogating them and the customs agent that she was talking to kept saying things like well you should have changed your last name you should have taken your husband's last name if you wanted to be able to prove that this is your daughter yeah that's not how things work or at least not how they used to work in this country now Customs and Border Protection says no we checked audio and video he doesn't say exactly that but here's what they also said okay let's go to graphic 82 CBP strongly recommends that unless a child is accompanied by both parents the adult traveling with the child have a note from the child's other parent or in the case of a child traveling with grandparents uncles or on sisters or brothers friends or in groups a note signed by both parents so if you don't take your husband's last name that means that you have to travel with notes proving that someone is your child think about that that means and I know that some of the right-wing are gonna be jubilant when I say this sentence men are back in charge so now you need my permission to travel it's like Saudi Arabia okay because that's my situation my wife has a different last name than me she's about to travel with my kids if she doesn't have a note for me she might not be led back into the country so I now get to say no you have to do whatever I tell you because you need a note from me now I know some guys out there yes right but that's not how it's supposed to be supposed to be equal under the law and we're back but we're back to the terrible old days where now women have to ask men for permission to travel but if you like that kind of country Satur you're a B is right around the corner you just go right take a plane that hey they even need a permission note to drive us out of your rabiul let alone take a plane but that's the direction we're going in no you don't have to take your husband's last name no this isn't the 18th century no your husband doesn't get to control you and I know that that drives the right-wing crazy but we're all supposed to be equal - easy wasteful young turks want us hit the subscribe button down below then you're a TYT subscriber and second is ring the bell and when you do that on youtube you're notified of our videos you
