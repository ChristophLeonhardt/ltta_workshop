WORK WITH PROSECUTORS AND TRY TO CUT A DEAL, AND GO FIGURE, DAYS

93

CUT A DEAL, AND GO FIGURE, DAYS LATER WE LEARNED THAT MANAFORT’S

00:03:18,568 --> 00:03:19,568
LATER WE LEARNED THAT MANAFORT’S ATTORNEYS WERE AT LEAST IN

95

ATTORNEYS WERE AT LEAST IN CONVERSATION WITH THE

WE DON’T KNOW WHAT THE PRESIDENT WILL SAY, HOW HE’LL TRY TO SPIN

101
00:03:29,946 --> 00:03:30,245
WILL SAY, HOW HE’LL TRY TO SPIN THAT.

MAYBE WE’LL FIND OUT TOMORROW MORNING ON TWITTER, BUT IT

104
00:03:33,082 --> 00:03:34,182
MORNING ON TWITTER, BUT IT CERTAINLY DOES -- THE MOST

105
00:03:34,216 --> 00:03:35,784
CERTAINLY DOES -- THE MOST INTERESTING THING IS THE FACT

106
00:03:35,785 --> 00:03:37,586
INTERESTING THING IS THE FACT THAT THEY COULDN’T REACH A DEAL.

107
00:03:37,587 --> 00:03:38,754
THAT THEY COULDN’T REACH A DEAL. USUALLY IF THERE IS GOING TO BE

A DEAL, IT’S OF SOME BENEFIT TO BOTH PARTIES.

110

BOTH PARTIES. WE HAVE NO IDEA IF IT’S SIMPLY

111
00:03:43,893 --> 00:03:46,194
WE HAVE NO IDEA IF IT’S SIMPLY THAT THE INVESTIGATORS THOUGHT

112
00:03:46,195 --> 00:03:47,462
THAT THE INVESTIGATORS THOUGHT THAT THEY JUST COULDN’T GET

113
00:03:47,463 --> 00:03:48,596
THAT THEY JUST COULDN’T GET ANYTHING THAT VALUABLE OUT OF

ANYTHING THAT VALUABLE OUT OF PAUL MANAFORT AT THIS POINT, BUT

PAUL MANAFORT AT THIS POINT, BUT IT IS A FASCINATING WRINKLE IN

116
00:03:52,068 --> 00:03:52,501
IT IS A FASCINATING WRINKLE IN THIS CASE.

117

HOW DO YOU READ THE "WALL STREET JOURNAL" REPORTING TONIGHT THAT

JOURNAL" REPORTING TONIGHT THAT AS RECENTLY AS LAST WEEK,

124
00:04:04,013 --> 00:04:05,113
AS RECENTLY AS LAST WEEK, MANAFORT WAS CONSIDERING

COOPERATING WITH FEDERAL PROSECUTORS AT THE SAME TIME THE

WHITE HOUSE HAS BEEN RUMBLING, RUDY GIULIANI PUTTING OUT SOME

RUDY GIULIANI PUTTING OUT SOME FIRES HIMSELF LATE LAST WEEK,

00:04:14,458 --> 00:04:15,858
FIRES HIMSELF LATE LAST WEEK, ABOUT THE PROSPECT OF A PARDON

131
00:04:15,892 --> 00:04:18,694
ABOUT THE PROSPECT OF A PARDON FOR PAUL MANAFORT?

132
00:04:18,762 --> 00:04:20,362
FOR PAUL MANAFORT? >> NICOLE, I THINK POSSIBLY THIS

133
00:04:20,430 --> 00:04:22,131
>> NICOLE, I THINK POSSIBLY THIS REPORT RAISES MORE QUESTIONS FOR

134
00:04:22,132 --> 00:04:24,700
REPORT RAISES MORE QUESTIONS FOR ME THAN IT GIVES ANSWERS.

135
00:04:24,701 --> 00:04:27,536
ME THAN IT GIVES ANSWERS. THE MOST OBVIOUS ONE IS WHAT

136
00:04:27,571 --> 00:04:28,804
THE MOST OBVIOUS ONE IS WHAT CAUSES THESE TALKS TO BREAK DOWN

137
00:04:28,838 --> 00:04:30,806
CAUSES THESE TALKS TO BREAK DOWN NOT JUST ON A GUILTY PLEA BUT ON

138
00:04:30,807 --> 00:04:31,206
NOT JUST ON A GUILTY PLEA BUT ON COOPERATION.

139
00:04:31,207 --> 00:04:32,241
COOPERATION. IF YOU WANT TO GET AN ACTUAL

140
00:04:32,275 --> 00:04:33,776
IF YOU WANT TO GET AN ACTUAL SERIOUS REDUCTION IN JAIL TIME,

141
00:04:33,810 --> 00:04:34,944
SERIOUS REDUCTION IN JAIL TIME, HE WAS GOING TO HAVE TO COME IN

142
00:04:34,978 --> 00:04:37,513
HE WAS GOING TO HAVE TO COME IN AND FULLY COOPERATE AGAINST THE

143
00:04:37,547 --> 00:04:38,747
AND FULLY COOPERATE AGAINST THE PRESIDENT OR ANYONE CLOSE TO THE

144
00:04:38,782 --> 00:04:39,114
PRESIDENT OR ANYONE CLOSE TO THE PRESIDENT.

145
00:04:39,149 --> 00:04:43,452
PRESIDENT. BUT THE OTHER QUESTION IT RAISES

146
00:04:43,453 --> 00:04:44,219
BUT THE OTHER QUESTION IT RAISES TOE AM

147
00:04:44,221 --> 00:04:46,555
TOE AM TO ME IS WHY IS THIS LEAKED NOW?

148
00:04:46,557 --> 00:04:48,824
TO ME IS WHY IS THIS LEAKED NOW? THERE WOULD ONLY BE TWO PARTIES,

149
00:04:48,825 --> 00:04:51,860
THERE WOULD ONLY BE TWO PARTIES, I THINK, PAUL MANAFORT AND BOB

150
00:04:51,862 --> 00:04:52,161
I THINK, PAUL MANAFORT AND BOB MUELLER.

151
00:04:52,196 --> 00:04:53,529
MUELLER. IT SEEMS FAIRLY OBVIOUS THAT

152
00:04:53,563 --> 00:04:55,664
IT SEEMS FAIRLY OBVIOUS THAT THIS CAME FROM MANAFORT AND HIS

153
00:04:55,698 --> 00:04:55,964
THIS CAME FROM MANAFORT AND HIS TEAM.

154
00:04:55,966 --> 00:04:56,966
TEAM. THE ONLY EXPLANATION I COULD

155
00:04:56,967 --> 00:04:58,134
THE ONLY EXPLANATION I COULD THINK OF THAT WOULD MAKE SENSE

156
00:04:58,168 --> 00:04:59,969
THINK OF THAT WOULD MAKE SENSE FOR THAT TYPE OF LEAK IS THEIR

157
00:05:00,003 --> 00:05:01,237
FOR THAT TYPE OF LEAK IS THEIR LEGAL STRATEGY FROM THE

158
00:05:01,271 --> 00:05:03,839
LEGAL STRATEGY FROM THE BEGINNING HAS SEEMED TO ME TO

159
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:05,974
BEGINNING HAS SEEMED TO ME TO PLAY FOR A PARDON.

160
00:05:05,976 --> 00:05:07,243
PLAY FOR A PARDON. THERE IS OVERWHELMING EVIDENCE

161
00:05:07,244 --> 00:05:08,778
THERE IS OVERWHELMING EVIDENCE IN BOTH THESE CASES, ONE IN

162
00:05:08,812 --> 00:05:10,479
IN BOTH THESE CASES, ONE IN VIRGINIA AND THE ONE COMING UP

163
00:05:10,481 --> 00:05:12,314
VIRGINIA AND THE ONE COMING UP IN D.C. WHERE THE EVIDENCE IS

164
00:05:12,349 --> 00:05:14,250
IN D.C. WHERE THE EVIDENCE IS EVEN STRONGER AGAINST MANAFORT,

165
00:05:14,251 --> 00:05:16,185
EVEN STRONGER AGAINST MANAFORT, AND THIS JUST MIGHT SIGNAL THE

166
00:05:16,186 --> 00:05:16,586
AND THIS JUST MIGHT SIGNAL THE PRESIDENCY.

167
00:05:16,620 --> 00:05:17,887
PRESIDENCY. LOOK, I’VE BEEN OUT HERE TAKING

168
00:05:17,888 --> 00:05:18,721
LOOK, I’VE BEEN OUT HERE TAKING A BULLET FOR YOU.

169
00:05:18,755 --> 00:05:21,390
A BULLET FOR YOU. I TOOK A VERY SERIOUS ONE IN

170
00:05:21,391 --> 00:05:23,292
I TOOK A VERY SERIOUS ONE IN VIRGINIA LAST WEEK, I’M

171
00:05:23,326 --> 00:05:24,160
VIRGINIA LAST WEEK, I’M CERTAINLY GOING TO BE SENTENCED

172
00:05:24,194 --> 00:05:25,294
CERTAINLY GOING TO BE SENTENCED TO JAIL TIME.

173
00:05:25,295 --> 00:05:26,996
TO JAIL TIME. I’M NOW LOOKING AT ANOTHER ONE

174
00:05:27,030 --> 00:05:27,830
I’M NOW LOOKING AT ANOTHER ONE COMING UP IN SEPTEMBER.

175
00:05:27,865 --> 00:05:29,165
COMING UP IN SEPTEMBER. I’M TRYING TO BE AS STRONG AS

176
00:05:29,166 --> 00:05:30,867
I’M TRYING TO BE AS STRONG AS YOU ASKED ME TO, BUT I NEED A

177
00:05:30,868 --> 00:05:31,501
YOU ASKED ME TO, BUT I NEED A LITTLE HELP.

178
00:05:31,502 --> 00:05:33,703
LITTLE HELP. I NEED THE PROMISE OF A PARDON.

179
00:05:33,704 --> 00:05:35,104
I NEED THE PROMISE OF A PARDON. I NEED SOMETHING MORE TANGIBLE

180
00:05:35,139 --> 00:05:36,339
I NEED SOMETHING MORE TANGIBLE THAN JUST A POSSIBILITY.

181
00:05:36,373 --> 00:05:37,206
THAN JUST A POSSIBILITY. THIS MAY HAVE BEEN A SIGNAL TO

182
00:05:37,241 --> 00:05:38,941
THIS MAY HAVE BEEN A SIGNAL TO THE PRESIDENT THAT IF I DON’T

183
00:05:38,976 --> 00:05:40,510
THE PRESIDENT THAT IF I DON’T GET THOSE ASSURANCES, I HAVE

184
00:05:40,511 --> 00:05:41,678
GET THOSE ASSURANCES, I HAVE ANOTHER OUT.

185
00:05:41,679 --> 00:05:44,814
ANOTHER OUT. >> JOYCE VANCE, THE PRESIDENT

186
00:05:44,815 --> 00:05:48,518
>> JOYCE VANCE, THE PRESIDENT CALLED OUT FLIPPERS, THAT IT

187
00:05:48,519 --> 00:05:49,886
CALLED OUT FLIPPERS, THAT IT OUGHT TO BE OUTLAWED.

188
00:05:49,887 --> 00:05:51,921
OUGHT TO BE OUTLAWED. HE ALSO SENT A SIGNAL TO STAY

189
00:05:51,922 --> 00:05:53,990
HE ALSO SENT A SIGNAL TO STAY STRONG TO HIS ONE-TIME SECURITY

190
00:05:53,991 --> 00:05:54,791
STRONG TO HIS ONE-TIME SECURITY ADVISER, MIKE FLYNN.

191
00:05:54,859 --> 00:05:56,359
ADVISER, MIKE FLYNN. MIKE FLYNN HAS BEEN COOPERATING,

192
00:05:56,427 --> 00:05:58,928
MIKE FLYNN HAS BEEN COOPERATING, I BELIEVE, THE LONGEST WITH TEAM

193
00:05:58,963 --> 00:06:00,663
I BELIEVE, THE LONGEST WITH TEAM AMERICA, WHICH IS WHAT ONE

194
00:06:00,698 --> 00:06:02,532
AMERICA, WHICH IS WHAT ONE FORMER FEDERAL PROSECUTOR CALLED

195
00:06:02,533 --> 00:06:04,100
FORMER FEDERAL PROSECUTOR CALLED THE MUELLER SPECIAL COUNSEL

196
00:06:04,101 --> 00:06:04,534
THE MUELLER SPECIAL COUNSEL INVESTIGATION.

197
00:06:04,535 --> 00:06:05,935
INVESTIGATION. TALK ABOUT WHAT BOB MUELLER

198
00:06:05,970 --> 00:06:07,603
TALK ABOUT WHAT BOB MUELLER COULD GET FROM PAUL MANAFORT.

199
00:06:07,638 --> 00:06:10,206
COULD GET FROM PAUL MANAFORT. HE ALREADY HAS HIS DEPUTY, RICK

200
00:06:10,207 --> 00:06:11,808
HE ALREADY HAS HIS DEPUTY, RICK GATES, HE ALREADY HAS MIKE

201
00:06:11,809 --> 00:06:12,108
GATES, HE ALREADY HAS MIKE FLYNN.

202
00:06:12,109 --> 00:06:14,510
FLYNN. WHAT WOULD MUELLER WANT WITH

203
00:06:14,512 --> 00:06:14,844
WHAT WOULD MUELLER WANT WITH MANAFORT?

204
00:06:14,879 --> 00:06:15,878
MANAFORT? WHAT WOULD MUELLER DEMAND FOR

205
00:06:15,913 --> 00:06:18,314
WHAT WOULD MUELLER DEMAND FOR ANY SORT OF LENIENCY OR ANY SORT

206
00:06:18,316 --> 00:06:20,250
ANY SORT OF LENIENCY OR ANY SORT OF DEAL FOR PAUL MANAFORT?

207
00:06:20,285 --> 00:06:26,256
OF DEAL FOR PAUL MANAFORT? >> I HAVE MAYBE A SLIGHTLY

208
00:06:26,257 --> 00:06:28,091
>> I HAVE MAYBE A SLIGHTLY LESSEN SAGS ALLESS

209
00:06:28,125 --> 00:06:28,758
LESSEN SAGS ALLESS LESS SENSATIONAL, LESS

210
00:06:28,759 --> 00:06:29,525
LESS SENSATIONAL, LESS INTERESTING VIEW OF WHAT THE

211
00:06:29,527 --> 00:06:30,360
INTERESTING VIEW OF WHAT THE TOPIC OF THESE NEGOTIATIONS

212
00:06:30,395 --> 00:06:31,228
TOPIC OF THESE NEGOTIATIONS MIGHT HAVE BEEN.

213
00:06:31,262 --> 00:06:32,429
MIGHT HAVE BEEN. MANAFORT DOESN’T REALLY LOOK

214
00:06:32,430 --> 00:06:34,831
MANAFORT DOESN’T REALLY LOOK LIKE SOMEONE WHO HAS THE ABILITY

215
00:06:34,899 --> 00:06:36,633
LIKE SOMEONE WHO HAS THE ABILITY TO GO IN AND ENGAGE IN SORT OF

216
00:06:36,667 --> 00:06:37,767
TO GO IN AND ENGAGE IN SORT OF THE FULL COOPERATION THAT

217
00:06:37,769 --> 00:06:39,369
THE FULL COOPERATION THAT PROSECUTORS WOULD DEMAND TO

218
00:06:39,371 --> 00:06:40,604
PROSECUTORS WOULD DEMAND TO COMPLETE A COOPERATION

219
00:06:40,638 --> 00:06:40,971
COMPLETE A COOPERATION AGREEMENT.

220
00:06:41,005 --> 00:06:43,040
AGREEMENT. SO WHAT WOULD MANAFORT HAVE THAT

221
00:06:43,074 --> 00:06:44,474
SO WHAT WOULD MANAFORT HAVE THAT HE COULD OFFER?

222
00:06:44,509 --> 00:06:45,375
HE COULD OFFER? PROSECUTORS WHO JUST FINISHED

223
00:06:45,376 --> 00:06:46,743
PROSECUTORS WHO JUST FINISHED TRYING A CASE IN THE EASTERN

224
00:06:46,778 --> 00:06:50,280
TRYING A CASE IN THE EASTERN DISTRICT OF VIRGINIA NOW HAVE TO

225
00:06:50,315 --> 00:06:52,415
DISTRICT OF VIRGINIA NOW HAVE TO GEAR UP AND GO TO TRIAL AGAIN IN

226
00:06:52,450 --> 00:06:52,849
GEAR UP AND GO TO TRIAL AGAIN IN WASHINGTON.

227
00:06:52,917 --> 00:06:53,683
WASHINGTON. THAT’S A CONSIDERABLE

228
00:06:53,751 --> 00:06:55,252
THAT’S A CONSIDERABLE EXPENDITURE OF TIME AND

229
00:06:55,253 --> 00:06:57,054
EXPENDITURE OF TIME AND RESOURCES, ESPECIALLY IF THEY

230
00:06:57,055 --> 00:06:59,489
RESOURCES, ESPECIALLY IF THEY HAVE THE INTENTION TO WORK ON

231
00:06:59,491 --> 00:07:00,156
HAVE THE INTENTION TO WORK ON ADDITIONAL CASES.

232
00:07:00,158 --> 00:07:02,359
ADDITIONAL CASES. SO IF MANAFORT WERE TO OFFER TO

233
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:08,765
SO IF MANAFORT WERE TO OFFER TO PLEAD GUILTY, IT WOULD, FOR ORZ,

234
00:07:08,766 --> 00:07:11,001
PLEAD GUILTY, IT WOULD, FOR ORZ, PROSECUTORS, BE AN EFFICIENCY

235
00:07:11,002 --> 00:07:11,368
PROSECUTORS, BE AN EFFICIENCY GAIN.

236
00:07:11,369 --> 00:07:13,871
GAIN. HE COULD PROBABLY SEEK FROM THEM

237
00:07:13,938 --> 00:07:15,973
HE COULD PROBABLY SEEK FROM THEM A LENIENCY FOR THE AMOUNT ON HIS

238
00:07:16,007 --> 00:07:17,774
A LENIENCY FOR THE AMOUNT ON HIS PROPERTY THAT MIGHT BE SEIZED,

239
00:07:17,809 --> 00:07:19,209
PROPERTY THAT MIGHT BE SEIZED, LEAVING HIM WITH RESOURCES THAT

240
00:07:19,210 --> 00:07:20,310
LEAVING HIM WITH RESOURCES THAT MIGHT PROVIDE FOR HIS FAMILY

241
00:07:20,311 --> 00:07:22,179
MIGHT PROVIDE FOR HIS FAMILY WHILE HE’S IN PRISON.

242
00:07:22,180 --> 00:07:24,214
WHILE HE’S IN PRISON. SO I WOULD RESIST LEAPING TO THE

243
00:07:24,249 --> 00:07:25,649
SO I WOULD RESIST LEAPING TO THE CONCLUSION THAT THE CONVERSATION

244
00:07:25,684 --> 00:07:28,419
CONCLUSION THAT THE CONVERSATION FELL APART OVER COOPERATION AND

245
00:07:28,453 --> 00:07:30,421
FELL APART OVER COOPERATION AND THINK THAT IT MIGHT BE A MUCH

246
00:07:30,422 --> 00:07:32,390
THINK THAT IT MIGHT BE A MUCH MORE MUNDANE SORT OF NEGOTIATION

247
00:07:32,424 --> 00:07:33,524
MORE MUNDANE SORT OF NEGOTIATION OVER A PLEA.

248
00:07:33,558 --> 00:07:35,159
OVER A PLEA. >> ROBERT COSTA, DONALD TRUMP

249
00:07:35,193 --> 00:07:37,228
>> ROBERT COSTA, DONALD TRUMP WAS TALKING ABOUT HIS APPROVAL

250
00:07:37,262 --> 00:07:39,964
WAS TALKING ABOUT HIS APPROVAL RATINGS AS THE COUNTRY WAS

251
00:07:39,998 --> 00:07:41,532
RATINGS AS THE COUNTRY WAS LARGELY MARKING THE PASSING OF

252
00:07:41,533 --> 00:07:42,333
LARGELY MARKING THE PASSING OF SENATOR JOHN McCAIN.

253
00:07:42,367 --> 00:07:43,901
SENATOR JOHN McCAIN. BUT ONE THING THAT DOESN’T GET

254
00:07:43,936 --> 00:07:45,336
BUT ONE THING THAT DOESN’T GET VERY GOOD APPROVAL RATINGS IS

255
00:07:45,403 --> 00:07:47,438
VERY GOOD APPROVAL RATINGS IS THE IDEA OF PARDONING PAUL

256
00:07:47,472 --> 00:07:48,306
THE IDEA OF PARDONING PAUL MANAFORT.

257
00:07:48,340 --> 00:07:49,907
MANAFORT. 60% OF AMERICANS THINK IT’S

258
00:07:49,908 --> 00:07:50,341
60% OF AMERICANS THINK IT’S INAPPROPRIATE.

259
00:07:50,342 --> 00:07:53,344
INAPPROPRIATE. ONLY 11% OF AMERICANS THINK IT’S

260
00:07:53,378 --> 00:07:53,744
ONLY 11% OF AMERICANS THINK IT’S APPROPRIATE.

261
00:07:53,745 --> 00:07:55,145
APPROPRIATE. WHAT ARE YOU HEARING FROM RUDY

262
00:07:55,147 --> 00:07:56,581
WHAT ARE YOU HEARING FROM RUDY GIULIANI AND SOURCES CLOSE TO

263
00:07:56,615 --> 00:07:57,915
GIULIANI AND SOURCES CLOSE TO THIS PRESIDENT ABOUT THE

264
00:07:57,916 --> 00:07:59,350
THIS PRESIDENT ABOUT THE CALCULATION DOWN THE ROAD TO

265
00:07:59,384 --> 00:08:01,686
CALCULATION DOWN THE ROAD TO POSSIBLY PARDON PAUL MANAFORT?

266
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:03,554
POSSIBLY PARDON PAUL MANAFORT? >> GIULIANI HAS TOLD ME THAT HE

267
00:08:03,589 --> 00:08:05,489
>> GIULIANI HAS TOLD ME THAT HE HAS HAD A DISCUSSION BACK IN

268
00:08:05,524 --> 00:08:07,558
HAS HAD A DISCUSSION BACK IN EARLY AUGUST ABOUT THE REMOTE

269
00:08:07,559 --> 00:08:08,959
EARLY AUGUST ABOUT THE REMOTE POSSIBILITY, IS THE WAY HE PUT

270
00:08:08,961 --> 00:08:10,661
POSSIBILITY, IS THE WAY HE PUT IT, BUT HE URGED THE PRESIDENT

271
00:08:10,696 --> 00:08:12,062
IT, BUT HE URGED THE PRESIDENT TO NOT EVEN CONSIDER IT.

272
00:08:12,064 --> 00:08:14,365
TO NOT EVEN CONSIDER IT. BUT THE FACT THAT THEY EVEN HAD

273
00:08:14,366 --> 00:08:16,067
BUT THE FACT THAT THEY EVEN HAD A CONVERSATION THAT BROACHED THE

274
00:08:16,068 --> 00:08:17,635
A CONVERSATION THAT BROACHED THE TOPIC SHOWS THAT IT’S ON THE

275
00:08:17,669 --> 00:08:19,570
TOPIC SHOWS THAT IT’S ON THE RADAR OF PRESIDENT TRUMP’S LEGAL

276
00:08:19,604 --> 00:08:21,105
RADAR OF PRESIDENT TRUMP’S LEGAL TEAM, SOMETHING THEY KNOW COULD

277
00:08:21,139 --> 00:08:23,574
TEAM, SOMETHING THEY KNOW COULD BE A POLITICAL BOMBSHELL THAT

278
00:08:23,575 --> 00:08:25,342
BE A POLITICAL BOMBSHELL THAT WOULD MAKE REPUBLICANS ALARMED

279
00:08:25,344 --> 00:08:26,577
WOULD MAKE REPUBLICANS ALARMED AS WELL AS DEMOCRATS IF THEY

280
00:08:26,612 --> 00:08:27,578
AS WELL AS DEMOCRATS IF THEY MOVED IN THAT DIRECTION.

281
00:08:27,579 --> 00:08:30,181
MOVED IN THAT DIRECTION. AND THEY ALSO FEEL -- SPEAKING

282
00:08:30,182 --> 00:08:31,549
AND THEY ALSO FEEL -- SPEAKING OF PEOPLE CLOSE TO THE

283
00:08:31,583 --> 00:08:32,683
OF PEOPLE CLOSE TO THE PRESIDENT, THAT THEY DON’T HAVE

284
00:08:32,717 --> 00:08:34,585
PRESIDENT, THAT THEY DON’T HAVE A LOT OF VISIBILITY NOW INTO

285
00:08:34,586 --> 00:08:35,719
A LOT OF VISIBILITY NOW INTO WHERE THIS MANAFORT

286
00:08:35,754 --> 00:08:36,487
WHERE THIS MANAFORT INVESTIGATION AND TRIAL IS

287
00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:38,355
INVESTIGATION AND TRIAL IS GOING, ESPECIALLY ON THE MUELLER

288
00:08:38,390 --> 00:08:38,689
GOING, ESPECIALLY ON THE MUELLER SIDE.

289
00:08:38,691 --> 00:08:40,391
SIDE. THEY KNOW MANAFORT WAS A

290
00:08:40,393 --> 00:08:41,659
THEY KNOW MANAFORT WAS A LONG-TIME FRIEND OF ROGER STONE,

291
00:08:41,659 --> 00:08:43,593
LONG-TIME FRIEND OF ROGER STONE, WHO IS UNDER A LOT OF SCRUTINY,

292
00:08:43,595 --> 00:08:44,796
WHO IS UNDER A LOT OF SCRUTINY, HIS ASSOCIATES, AT LEAST, RIGHT

293
00:08:44,830 --> 00:08:46,765
HIS ASSOCIATES, AT LEAST, RIGHT NOW FROM ROBERT MUELLER AND HIS

294
00:08:46,799 --> 00:08:47,198
NOW FROM ROBERT MUELLER AND HIS INVESTIGATORS.

295
00:08:47,233 --> 00:08:48,499
INVESTIGATORS. SO THAT’S WHAT EVERYONE IS

296
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:51,035
SO THAT’S WHAT EVERYONE IS TRYING TO FIGURE OUT THE CHESS

297
00:08:51,070 --> 00:00:00,000
TRYING TO FIGURE OUT THE CHESS MOVES HERE BY MUELLER.
