Outright denials. Rogue killers.
Botched interrogations.
Ever since Saudi dissident
and U.S. resident
Jamal Khashoggi’s
bizarre disappearance,
the kingdom has given
all kinds of explanations
about what happened
and who is responsible.
Khashoggi was last
seen on Oct. 2,
when he entered the
Saudi Consulate in Istanbul,
and apparently,
never came out.
Here’s how the storyline
has changed.
First, Saudi Arabia said
Khashoggi left the consulate
and expressed concern
about his well-being.
Government-aligned Turkish media
said he was brutally murdered
by 15 Saudi hitmen.
They even released
their names and images.
Saudi Arabia then
started pushing back.
In two statements,
it denounced
“baseless allegations”
and called them “lies.”
As the accusations
and evidence mounted,
the Saudis started getting
more forceful in their denials.
And their messages
took on a threatening tone.
Like in this tweet from
the Foreign Ministry saying,
“Demise is the outcome
of these weak endeavors.”
The tweet was mysteriously
deleted the next day.
“As of this moment,
they deny it.”
When Trump said
there would be —
“And there will be
severe punishment.”
Saudi Arabia lashed out,
saying it rejected threats.
More reports
continued to come out.
Some of them were grisly.
“On the recordings,
you can hear Khashoggi
was detained when he entered,
killed and dismembered.
One official saying,
you can hear
how he was interrogated, 
tortured and murdered.”
That’s when the Saudis
seemed to be testing out
an eyebrow-raising theory and
using President Trump
to help sell it.
“It sounded to me like
maybe these could have been
rogue killers — who knows?”
Then, yet another twist.
Sources close to Saudi Arabia
started teasing the idea
that yes, Khashoggi was dead —
but it was because of an
interrogation gone wrong.
But they also continued
to maintain
the king and crown prince
had no knowledge of it.
The Saudis say
they’re investigating.
And when Secretary of State
Mike Pompeo arrived
in Saudi Arabia,
there were smiles
and pleasantries.
It looked like
business as usual.
But after the
head-spinning stories
about a suspected gory murder
by a key U.S. ally,
it was anything but.
