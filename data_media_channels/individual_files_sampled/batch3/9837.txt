WORDS. PERHAPS THE COMMANDER DUE TO MY DISTRACTING BACK. Shannon: THEY HAVE SOME THINGS TO DISCUSS. ED HENRY, THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THERE WERE HOLDING PARTY HAS BEEN SPLIT ON TERRACE FOUR MONTHS. THE ISSUE WAS THE REASON THE FORMER WHITE HOUSE ECONOMIC ADVISOR GARY COHN RESIGNED. THE HOUSE WAYS AND MEANS COMMITTEE, HE'S CONFIDENT THAT HIS FELLOW REPUBLICANS AND ALSO DEMOCRATS DIRE PREDICTIONS OF THE IMPACT OF THE TARIFFS ON THE U.S. ECONOMY WILL NOT PAN OUT. CONGRESSMAN, WELCOME. THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME ON. Shannon: LET'S TALK ABOUT THESE OBJECTIONS. BEFORE THEM FROM BOTH SIDES. TONIGHT, THOUGH, TOP GEO SENATOR ORRIN HATCH HAD THIS TO SAY. "MY POSITION REMAINS UNCHANGED. TARIFFS ON STEEL AND ALUMINUM IMPORTS ARE A TAX HIKE ON AMERICANS AND WILL HAVE DAMAGING CONSEQUENCES FOR CONSUMERS, MANUFACTURERS, AND WORKERS." DO YOU THINK HE HAS IT WRONG? I APPRECIATE THOSE COMMENTS. I DO APPRECIATE WITH THE PRESIDENT IS DOING BRADY'S BRINGING DISRUPTIVE POLICIES TO THE TRADE AGENDA TO SEND A MESSAGE TO NOT ONLY OUR ALLIES, MOST IMPORTANTLY TO CHINA, WE WILL FOLLOW THROUGH AND PUTTING AMERICAN INTEREST FIRST. THAT IS OF HER MESSAGE THAT YOU HAVE NOT HEARD ON THE TRADE AGENDA. WHAT I SEE OUT OF THIS ADMINISTRATION, EXACTLY WHAT THEY PROMISE TO DO. DISRUPT THE TRADE POLICY TO PUT AMERICAN INTEREST IN THE SAME EQUAL LEVEL PLAYING FIELD OF FAIR TRADE, NOT TRADE THAT IS AT OUR COST. Shannon: MEXICO AND CANADA BASICALLY SAYING, MEXICO SAYS IT WILL BE TIT-FOR-TAT, THEY TALKED ABOUT EXACTLY WHAT THEY WILL GO AFTER, WITH REGARD TO AMERICAN PRODUCTS. STEEL, LAMPS, PORK SHOULDERS, SAUSAGE, YOU KNOW, APPLES, ALL KINDS OF THINGS. THOSE INDUSTRIES TONIGHT ARE SOUNDING THE ALARM. THEY ARE WORRIED ABOUT THIS, THOSE ARE AMERICAN COMPANIES THAT DO YOU HAVE A POTENTIAL DOWNSIDE TO THIS WHOLE ISSUE. WHAT YOU SAY TO THEM TO REASSURE THEM? I APPRECIATE THAT. THERE IS A PROCESS FOR THESE TARIFFS, IN ORDER TO BE LEGAL. THEY HAVE A PROCESS TO GO THROUGH IN REGARD TO OUR AGREEMENTS AS WELL AS POTENTIAL IMPLICATIONS. AT THE END OF THE DAY, I THINK WHAT THIS SENSE, WHEN CANADA WALKS AWAY FROM THE TABLE, THEY BETTER UNDERSTAND, THERE'S CONSEQUENCES TO THAT. THEY NEED TO STAY AT THE TABLE, NEGOTIATE THIS, JUST LIKE BRAZIL AND SOUTH KOREA NEGOTIATED THROUGH THIS, THE PRESIDENT SAT WITH THEM AND NEGOTIATED A RESOLUTION NETWORK FOR BOTH SIDES TO MAKE IT A FAIR AGREEMENT GOING FORWARD. THIS IS EXACTLY WHAT CANADA AND MEXICO SHOULD BE DOING AS WELL AS THE E.U. WE ARE GOOD ALLIES, WE CAN WORK THIS OUT. YOU GOT TO NEGOTIATE IN GOOD FAITH TO PROTECT THE AMERICAN INTERESTS AS WELL AS THE ROLE INTERESTS. Shannon: HERE IS FOR THE HOUSE SPEAKER HAS TO SAY ABOUT THIS. PAUL RYAN SAYS "I DISAGREE WITH THE DECISION. INSTEAD OF ADDRESSING THE REAL PROBLEM IN THE INTERNATIONAL TRADE OF THESE PRODUCTS, IT TARGETS AMERICA'S ALLIES WHEN WE SHOULD BE WORKING WITH THEM TO ADDRESS THE UNFAIR TRADING PRACTICES OF COUNTRIES LIKE CHINA." WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF THAT? REPORTED THAT FROM A NUMBER OF PEOPLE, SAYING, THE REAL BAD ACTOR IS CHINA. WE NEED TO TEAM UP WITH MEXICO AND CANADA TO TAKE ON THAT FACT. THAT IS WHY CANADA SHOULDN'T BE LEAVING THE ROOM, THEY SHOULD BE STAYING ON THE ROOM, AND WORK IT OUT. I'M CONFIDENT WE CAN. IF NOT WE ARE SENDING A MESSAGE TO CHINA. IF WE ARE WILLING TO STAND FIRM IN REGARDS TO OUR ALLIES, WHEN WE GO AFTER TO CHINA, THE BIG ELEPHANT IN THE ROOM, THE ONE THAT IS THE MOST EGREGIOUS OFFENDER OF OUR TRADE POLICIES THAT ARE AGAINST AMERICAN INTERESTS, WE ARE GOING TO SEND A MESSAGE TO CHINA THAT WE ARE NOT MESSING AROUND ANYMORE. IT IS TIME TO PUT AMERICAN INTEREST ON THE SAME PLAYING FIELD OF OTHERS TAKING ADVANTAGE OF US FOR YEARS. Shannon: A LOT OF FOLKS WHO VOTED FOR THE PRESIDENT FOR THAT VERY REASON, A STRONG MESSAGE OF HIS THROUGHOUT THE CAMPAIGN. NO ONE SHOULD BE SURPRISED.
