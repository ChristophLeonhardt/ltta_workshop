ten years ago Australia's Prime Minister apologised to a stolen generation of indigenous people for policies that systematically remove them from their families but today more indigenous children are being removed than ever before leaving some to ask is this a new stolen generation I'm Steve Chow on this episode of 101 East we investigate the crisis facing Australia's indigenous families and the systems meant to protect them they may look like any happy Australian family celebrating a mother's birthday but heartache isn't far beneath the surface Helen Eason and her children have spent years torn apart and it's good just to have you and for you to come to my Inn to be here like thousands of other indigenous families or of Helens children were removed by Child Welfare after a long legal battle the family was reunited just over a year ago they take your young and you have so many taken you are not whole even when they come home as much as they're all they're all them pieces can never ever be put back together for 18 year old rain the memories of being removed when he was 10 are still raw one police officer grabbed me and my mom was trying to fly to and stuff and how did you feel then but upset says orange kid did you have any sense of why they were taking you know if not all most a been kidnapped and taken somewhere you know and me at first rain and his younger brother and sister were placed with the same foster carer but his sister ran away and rain was moved away from his brother that's been my family not like being a family really welcomes and said like we've all separated sexually abused as a child and the victim of domestic violence as an adult helen suffers from bipolar disorder and was addicted to drugs but rain says he always felt loved she was fine and you went to school yeah I did I would say I didn't go to every dad but I was there any time when you felt unsafe uncared-for they were never in danger always always see Dave my babies too and they will beat your dad died Helen's mother told child welfare she was prepared to care for her grandchildren I could have all about 36 grandchildren I could have all of them except my daughter's children in my home when you'd ask him why and my unsuitable they said oh we don't have to answer that and it was it was very very hard this was that one of the visits and we just try and make everything as normal as possible and still like that family unit Helen says she saw her children really when they were in care so how many visits did you have with them I was saying Noah as I said the four times a year to two hours four times a year truly and rain I was a lot more luckier with I think it was fortnightly and then it went to monthly so that would have been like a month before he was taken and how were you at that stage I was fine I was still struggling with the marijuana but as I said I'm on it it was honest to everyone four years after her other children were removed her 15 month-old baby was taken things got crazy I don't know all I can remember is running two different people and just begging them what please don't take my baby like why are you doing this there's no need to take him away Helen went into a downward spiral she and the father of her two youngest children ending up in prison for drug crimes it's wrong what they do I understand like yes um in some situations kids should be taken but before you do take them trying to help the people before him before just ripping them out of the family Australia has a dark history of forcibly removing indigenous children from their homes placing them in institutions or with white families they're known as a stolen generation in 2008 that then Prime Minister Kevin Rudd made an historic apology we apologize for the laws and policies of successive Parliament's and governments that have inflicted profound grief suffering and loss on these our fellow Australians the Prime Minister speech was meant to heal the wounds of the past to the mothers and the father's the brothers and the sisters for the breaking up of families and communities we say sorry a decade on Helen Eason and her mother take to the streets of Sydney leading a charge to stop indigenous children being removed from their families they started a now nationwide organization called grandmothers against removals 10th anniversary of the apology optimism has turned to despair in the past decade the number of indigenous children being removed from their families and the numbers are now higher than ever in the country's history today Aboriginal children are almost 10 times more likely to be placed in out of home care than non-indigenous children to me Stolen Generation never ever stops it's all been about genocide it's never been about the protection of the children almost 3,000 kilometres away in the central Australian town of Alice Springs the child welfare crisis is dividing the large local indigenous community there's no point saying we're creating another stolen generation and stopping kids from being removed from really horrible circumstances and we've got the highest numbers of family violence we've got the highest rates of you know child neglect and abuse and and this is why our children are being removed that's a simple fact and if we cannot recognize that and acknowledge that we're not going to actually get around to fixing the problem because it starts with actually recognizing that just enterprise is an Alice Springs councillor and has ambitions to enter the national political arena but her blunt message has drawn scorn and anger today she's heading to court with her mother and father to get a protection order after a death threat I've been called a sellout because my detractors basically think that I should remain quiet and I should just regurgitate the same old rhetoric and view myself as a victim to white colonisation whereas I simply rather just be a human being and a woman who is more concerned about the welfare of Aboriginal women and children and I guess I'm attacked because I speak a lot of the truth and these trees are really hurtful truth jacinta's firmly isn't immune to the problems faced by many Aboriginal families at this indigenous camp on the outskirts of Alice Springs she and her mother introduced us to their kin auntie Giuli looks after three children from their extended family and another six are under the care of close family friend Marian we can't identify the children for legal reasons they were given to me because of their mum and you know their parents drinking a lot and you know neglecting these kids Marian is in a blood relative nor indigenous but lifelong bonds have made her just like family the royal family and they will relate to each other I've had him since he was a baby and they just sort of kept coming one after the other and I couldn't shut the door mum sister to alcohol she's only in her twenties three of the boys living with Marian suffer from fetal alcohol syndrome their mother's heavy drinking during pregnancy has left them with hearing and spinal disorders as well as cognitive and behavioral problems they see the specialist every three months with their alcohol syndrome there are medication but recently the family was forced into mediation over one of the boys after living with Marian's family in town for the past two years some of his other relatives wanted him placed with them on a remote Aboriginal community to the oven and about it and they said no they want him to stay with you because when his mum was passing on her deathbed she asked me to take him to bring him up with a few system yeah and and so that he had all the opportunities for him to have a good life and she didn't want him back out on community where there wasn't any services problems I think we need more more you know women like Mary and I think we need to get past the point of you know separating us all from race and recognizing that we're in fact human beings and these children human beings they're Australian citizens and they deserve the same rights as any other child in this country but we're putting their culture before their rights as human beings and I think that's where the system is failing them and of course the stigma that has been brought about because of the original stolen generation I think it's a subtle extension of the Stolen Generation Jacinda prices view is rejected by the local tongue and Uruk council CEO Walter Shaw if you remove Aboriginal children from the Aboriginal community you muscle shut down Aboriginal communities one could say that these children being placed in the they can protection of welfare and the foster care arrangements with non Aboriginal children is that they are being doctrine aided with values other than being Aboriginal people of the Aboriginal children in foster care 40% are placed with non-indigenous families Walter Shaw says his counsel wants to change this and keep children in their communities kinship care for our organization is an imperative I think we need to move to a system where we support Aboriginal families that are functional and strong Aboriginal families to become those foster carers we've set up a Family Safety Group that are now talking sensitively around all forms of violence community domestic you know talking about the the alcohol issue the drug issue but for 16 year-old Sarah it's a case of too little too late she was born into a family plagued by drug and alcohol fueled domestic violence don't be cups go throwing I'm getting bashed obviously just just real violent stuff Sarah's mother Denise became involved with Sarah's father when she was 13 and he was 18 she says the Department of Children and Families or DCF placed her with her boyfriend's family despite their relationship he beat me like real bad like a few on a few occasions and DCF was well aware of that they had to take me hospital a few times I just felt like I was pounded off and left and forgotten about yeah and I didn't have the chance to leave that the couraged even they were the support to leave that relationship right until I was 23 24 yeah but when she escaped to Alice Springs with her three kids to live with her dad she says she couldn't cope and he could imagine a lineage if dad and he's beaten his woman in this drop girl gave everything in the house I went to DCF office and I asked them for help and thinking that there would have been some kind of supports there but there wasn't the stress levels ended up getting higher they're like I couldn't really keep the kids under control and so they were running amok and getting out of control I then started to smack and hit my kids she used to like coming back drunk and we would be sleeping the room and she'd come in Chuck cupboard said I said I'll come back one day after school and I'm me and mom was arguing yeah she ends up flooding me giving me two black eyes and sent me to school the next day with two black eyes for then seven-year-old Sarah that led to almost a decade in residential care it was alright at first when I was younger and then later on down track just what's getting hard and I started understanding things a little bit more thanks you can show me around town the suburbs of Alice Springs are littered with Sarah's former care homes and I mean altogether how many places do you reckon you're in 20 plus in just 10 years it's a lot of places I could show you about six houses in this one little area yes you know that story of turning about that boy you sound like a subscriber as we pass another residential facility the memories get worse she says an assault by a care worker when she was 11 has left her traumatized anything anything called me cuz I was young still you know and I didn't think anything of it I don't know yeah he opened his legs and his fly was down I jumped up and I went to Herndon and then I was just dozing off just hitting and as I was gonna sleep he walked in the room and does a year later at another care facility she says she was repeatedly abused by a boy a couple of years older than her time when I tried to smash his head in with him a lamp who was wrong and you know he cares wasn't gonna do anything about it so I was just soft defending myself and Cara's never believe means I I went off at the cares and then I called mom to come cuz that wouldn't believe me the Department of Children and Families says it can't comment on individual cases but records show that almost 10% of children in out-of-home care in the Northern Territory are abused neglected or exploited for Sara it was a turning point her life spun out of control she began running away from care homes living on the streets or at her mother's and committing crimes I felt safer and what I didn't care just turned real heartless and just did whatever I could to make a good reason to get locked up you know it's just a guy breaking still people's cars and I just used to go best people on the streets and everything but now when I look back with that the edges feel so bad for do a little she's told me some horrific stories about being you know abused by other residents by workers and just about complete lack of care for her as a human being Tonya Collins was Sarah's lawyer at the height of her offending when she was about 12 kids who under the care of the minister then become kids in the criminal justice system and very very quickly and they were very closely there's an interaction because often territory families lose track of the kids and which means they're basically left to their own devices for long periods of time and that's how I got to know Sarah again a number of years later and it was then the two developed an unexpected friendship as how ex lawyers should come and see me and say hello and you know we had a good relationship she obviously wasn't being supported by territory families she had a very difficult home life you know things that we all take for granted she wasn't having and so I started to sort of pay for her food every day and buy her clothes and you know try and support her yeah I just feel like she just started liking me and we just bonded together and then I'm yes you vanatter fuss to me and do all this stuff for me Sara moved in with Tanya but it wasn't to be it was very challenging because you hope that you can be the person who can save someone or deliver them a a better life and but the reality is that's not it's not as clear-cut as that when I was on the street you know only rules are followed was my rules I didn't have to listen to anyone else cuz I was on the streets and I no one cared about me and then she stepped in and then wanted to care for me and everything and it was just hard to click straight on to the routines again yeah I just fan I just found it difficult I couldn't cope Sara went back to live at her mother's place with her boyfriend an extended family dysfunctional traumatic unsustainable difficult yeah it's not great no it's not good Sara's mother continues to struggle with drug and alcohol addiction today she's at court for a number of assault charges and for being intoxicated while on bail I'm not a person that drink or every week and all that sort of stuff but there have been occasions in the past where it has led to violence yeah with me and my eggs yeah but not with my kids I hope I don't beat my kids when I'm intoxicated and stuff like that they say you do yeah but I don't there's a big difference yeah every time that I hit my kids some things say about I've been intoxicated or anything like that Sarah turns up at the court but she's not happy about it she wants me to stand up in court and tell the judge that she shouldn't go to jail sherek and she should go to my father he after everything she's done questioning she can't keep getting away with it she keeps saying she's kind of changed but yeah last night she was trained in doing the same on her mother gets a reprieve but it's told she needs to do a rehabilitation program I know she won't and dustless just looked at the judge I was like what the hell are you really gonna do this yeah I don't know how does that make you feel to think that she's not gonna go I don't care it's her life she want to get help she can get help she doesn't she doesn't I'm not the one suffering her she is because she has now got that maturity to actually say okay this is not about me anymore it's about my mum my mum has got her own problems she's got her own issues and I can make myself have a better life and I don't want to repeat those mistakes and that's really compelling and a wonderful thing to see in Sarah in that from someone who used to be known in this town as probably you know the number one disliked youth offender to have turned her life so around now Sarah's not been in trouble for more than three years she's now her own guardian and remarkably has started a police cadet ship they may not live under the same roof but she and Tanya continue to have a strong bond she is like my mother in my eyes my mother's tenure not Denise because ten years I'm a lot more for me and helped me a lot more than what moments she is a good girl one tanya has been Sarah's angel I don't know where Sarah would be now without a I am so grateful for real if I could give her in my heart I will give it to her she came along and did something I couldn't do yeah my pastas never gonna leave me you know it's always can it be David me I just got to learn to cope with it I just gotta learn to say oh oh that happened to me deal with everyone that's what I that's what I try and do it does get hard but I try Sarah may have survived a broken family and a dangerously flawed child protection system but the sorry fact remains that a decade on from the government's apology to the Stolen Generation indigenous children are increasingly at risk you
