I have become friendly with a student at Marjory Stoneman Douglas high school whose name is Kyle Kashyap if he first started becoming prominent when he was speaking out in favor of gun rights even though he was a witness to what happened at the parkland element at the Parkland High School and the entire left basically ignored him and so I pointed out to the media that they should stop ignoring survivors who disagreed with them and so he started getting booked a little bit more and one of the things that has happened in the past couple of days is that there are a bunch of people on the Left who have attacked him and the reason this is relevant is because of course there was this massive boycott launched against Laura Ingraham by the left suggesting that she'd been mean to another parkland survivor named David Hogg David Hogg of course had been the kid who'd gone on TV and suggested that everyone who disagreed with him was basically a murderer with blood on their hands taking NR a blood money and Laura Ingraham said that he was whining about his college admissions and ill-advised comment and then there was a boycott against her well Kyle was attacked in much more nefarious fashion by the left and no one seems to be commenting on this other than to say that the guy who did it is kind of crazy so the guy who did it is a guy named Kurt - well Kurt - Wald on his by a group but on his bio on Twitter five days ago it said he was an MSNBC contributor and a Vanity Fair contributing editor right that's what it said on his on his biography well a few days ago he ripped into Kyle on Twitter I pointed this out and MSNBC started losing sponsors and so MSNBC came out they said well actually we would not hired him for since February 20 since February he hasn't been able to to really do anything since February hasn't been with MSNBC so first Kurt had to had to remove the MSNBC contributor part of his Twitter profile so suddenly it just said Kurt I can Wald Vanity Fair contributing editor New York Times bestselling author okay then yesterday Kurt sent me this wild email this wild wild email and here's what its heads had been I'm working on an article about you and your relationship with Kyle cash of the kid from parkland I'm not gonna be using his name for reasons that will become apparent a few items one he's been actively working to trick journalists he believes work for non Fox television networks into taking any action in something in which his Twitter account was linked to he's been cordoning with some of the trolls involved with the people three he in fact coordinated with the other guy with the podcast who was demanding my respect he is the same attack on me as the other guy which was unprovoked he used this garbage pushed by conservative media and leftist that I am a fan of tentacle porn okay that's that's what he actually wrote because about a year ago it turned out that Kurt I can Wald tweeted out a link accidentally to tentacle porn and I think that was the story and and Oren he tweeted out a picture of himself in the background of his computer was a picture of tentacle porn something like that and then he said that he was just using it for research purposes or he wanted to show his kids he was his kids had said something about tentacle porn didn't believe that it was real so he went looking for it in any case this became a point of humor against Kurt I can Wald and this email that he sent to me about Kyle goes on and on and on and on I mean it is a long long email and the best part of it was where he says this so remember all of this started with Kurt I can Wald saying that the boycott against Laura Ingraham was justified because Laura Ingraham had been means to a park land survivor Kyle cash-flow kyle cashew is a park land survivor here is what Kurt I can well wrote in this email to me that he sent to me this crazy email quote I engaged in ADM conversation with Kyle which was quite disturbing I consulted a friend of mine who is a psychiatrist a political conservative since that seems so important to you and based on what he read the psychiatrist said the following one Kyle is in desperate need of psychiatric help or support the psychiatrist did not have enough information to assess if the issues he saw in the conversation where the consequence of the shooting being psychologically unprepared for being thrust into the conservative media as a go-to kid or if there's an underlying pathology that preceded these events - Kyle is obsessed with you in fact our DM conversation with you which involves a lot of irrational rage seemed to have been sparked by my asking you to debate and then he goes on and finally the very end of this email oh he asks a series of questions suggesting that I am running Kyle that I am the nefarious for it the Kyle doesn't have zone opinions he wasn't conservative before he got me that Kyle has been getting his cues from me now listen I've openly said on the program that I talked with Kyle feel like there's no secret about this I think Kyle is a good kid I think he's trying to do the right thing and I think he deserves support in the same way that I'm sure that David Hogg talks with a bunch of folks on the Left including Media Matters there's nothing wrong with that but the best part of this email is where Kurt says the very end of it don't forward this email to Kyle he does not need to know what a psychiatrist is saying about him you have heard him enough so this guy who purported to be a vanity fair' contributing editor he sends me an email accusing Kyle Kash of a parkland survivor of being psychologically deficient right to having a psychiatric problem and then says at the end of the email that I am harming him and I shouldn't forward the email so naturally I did what any rational person would do when you receive a crazy email like this I immediately posted it on Twitter the entire text of it and Vanity Fair responded by sending out a notice that Kurt I can Wald no longer works for Vanity Fair that he hasn't worked for Vanity Fair for several years so Kurt's Twitter biography shrunk yet again and now he was no longer an MSc because MSNBC contributor or a Vanity Fair contributing editor he he actually emailed I believe his brian Stelter CNN claiming that no he was still a Vanity Fair contributing editor in Vanity Fair was like that no you're not and you haven't written for us since 2014 so all of this is to say listen I don't want to pick on a guy when he's down kick a guy when he's down but all of this is to say that there are people on the Left who do attack parkland survivors and the blowback on them does not extend to their to their venues doesn't really extend to their outlets it's been largely ignored read John Walsh as we played yes as we use and played yesterday said some nasty things about Kyle Kashyap there's been no boycott up Ford against CNN when the left wants to boycott something they're doing it for political purposes the right usually is better than that and usually doesn't engage in these kind of boycotts unless it is a reverse boycott like they're boycotting chick-fil-a and we say okay we'll all go shop at chick-fil-a just to show that we're not going to allow you to boycott institutions we like out of business but it's amazing what the same left that says you can't target a parklands shooter it can't target rather a parkland survivor will say that if it's a parkland survivor we don't like that we will actually go have them psychologically evaluated without their knowledge and then say that you should not tell the person that that happened it's an amazing thing and frankly I think the kyle has a very solid legal case for defamation against Curt so we'll see how all of that goes but things certainly are crazy
