workers at the memorial site of the former Nazi death camp Auschwitz say they've become the target of a hate campaign waged by Polish nationalists they've also denounced an increase in anti-semitic incidents since a controversial Holocaust speech law was passed in the country earlier this year most recently the home of an Italian guide at the concentration camp was vandalized with swastikas and xenophobic slogans including Poland for the poles and only Polish guides at Auschwitz Polish nationalists have accused officials at the memorial site of downplaying the death of non-jewish Polish prisoners in the camp by focusing on its Jewish victims what we hear is that people who died here mostly were Jews that's a lie let me speak and so it is the government of Israel and Jews Polish Jews especially are attacking us they make us look bad I'll show it's museum officials also say they've been victims of a wave of online harassment and fake news reportedly incited by nationalists they've also denied claims the museum's activities have not been representative enough of Polish Jews or Poland's new Holocaust speech law bans claims the country collaborated with Nazi Germany during World War two specifically the legislation prohibits references to wartime Nazi death camps in the country as being polish and that those in violation of the law could face up to three years behind bars and are since being passed in February the law has been met with a backlash in particular from Israel and America why the Polish government has seen fit to come up with this legislation forbidding people to have an opinion about the guilt or lack thereof of the Polish nation it is bad for our governments to try and regulate culture and history and literature one one can understand what why they would like to have some control over the narrative but it is all in all the bad practice the history of Auschwitz no matter whether they are polish or foreign should be the guides there and this should be the standard everywhere in every Museum or memorial and this claim that guides should only be natives is really xenophobic it's against foreigners it has nothing to do with some effort to make the museum better informed you
