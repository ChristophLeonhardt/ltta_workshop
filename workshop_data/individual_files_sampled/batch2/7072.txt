THERE ARE TWO NEW LAWSUITS THAT HAVE ARISEN AROUND TRUMPS TRANSIT SERVICE MEMBER BAN AND LET'S GIVE YOU A LITTLE BIT MORE INFORMATION ABOUT WHO IS FILING THEM AND WHO IS BEHIND THEM. VERSES FROM THE ACLU. THE MARYLAND BRANCH FILED A LAWSUIT RIGHT AFTER THE TRANS BAN CAME INTO EFFECT AND THEN LAST FRIDAY DURING THE NEWS TRUMP BROUGHT UP AGAIN BY TRUMP THROUGH A NEW MORE FORMAL ISSUE. THE ACLU HAD TWEETED WILL SEE YOU IN COURT. THEY HAVE FIVE TRANSGENDER SERVICEMEMBERS, THERE'S A NINE YEAR VETERAN, A TEN YEAR VETERAN, A SIX-YEAR ACTIVE-DUTY AIRMAN. IT IS KIND OF AMAZING. THERE IS A 13 YEAR VETERAN AND A 16 YEAR VETERAN, TRAIN SERVICE MEMBERS OUT THERE ALL BEHIND THIS. THE SECOND IS BY LAMBDA LEGAL AND THERE IS A 12 YEAR VETERAN INVOLVED IN THAT AND THEN TO FOLKS WHO WANT - TWO TRANS INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE TRYING TO JOIN THE SERVICE AND ONE OF THEM IS DREW LAYNE. HE WANTS TO JOIN THE MILITARY AND THE AIR FORCE AS A SURVIVAL OF ASIAN RESISTANCE AND ESCAPE SPECIALIST AND HERE IS WHAT DREW SAID FOR HIMSELF. HE SAID: RIGHT NOW HE IS 16 YEARS OLD. IT IS A SUPER INSPIRING STORY. HIS MOTHER, LAURA GARZA SAID ñ AND SHE HAS SAID SHE AGREES WITH TRUMP ON CERTAIN ISSUES, JUST NOT THIS ONE. SHE SAYS: I ABSOLUTELY AGREE WITH HER. I'M CURIOUS TO SEE WHAT SHE AGREES WITH TRUMP ON, MY BUT WHATEVERÖ IS NOT RELEVANT. THAT 16-YEAR-OLD IS AMAZING. THE FACT THAT HE IS SO CLEAR IN WHAT HE WANTS TO DO AND HE IS A PERSON WITH CONVICTIONS, PERSON WHO IS MOTIVATED AND HUNGRY AND WANTS TO FULFILL HIS GOALS. THAT IS THE TYPE OF AMERICAN EVERYONE IN THIS COUNTRY SHOULD BE PROUD OF, NOT THE TYPE OF AMERICAN THAT WE SHOULD FIGHT TO TAKE RIGHTS AWAY FROM AND SO LOOK, HOW MANY 16-YEAR-OLDS DO YOU SEE FIGHTING FOR THINGS LIKE THIS? EVEN COMING FROM A DISENFRANCHISED GROUP OF PEOPLE, HAVING THE COURAGE TO COME FORWARD AND SAYING NO, THIS IS NOT OKAY. I'M NOT GOING TO LET TRUMP STOP ME FROM PROTECTING MY COUNTRY, FROM SERVING MY COUNTRY. WHEN AMAZING PERSON AND LOOK, WE ALL KNOW WHAT THE TRANSGENDER BAN WAS REALLY ABOUT. IT'S ABOUT DOING SOMETHING THAT GOES AGAINST WHAT OBAMA DID DURING HIS ADMINISTRATION BECAUSE ANYTHING THAT OBAMA DID REGARDLESS OF HOW LOGICAL AND REGARDLESS OF HOW MUCH COMMON SENSE WAS TO BEHIND IT, TRUMP WANTS TO DO THE OPPOSITE. IT'S LIKE HE IS A CHILD AND HE WANTED TO PANDER TO HIS BASE. THERE HAVE BEEN NO LEGISLATIVE WINS. HE HASN'T SUCCEEDED IN DOING ANYTHING HE PROMISED TO DO AND THIS IS JUST AN EASY WAY OF GETTING SOMETHING DONE PAINTING TO HIS BASE SAYING WHAT I CAN TRANSGENDER PEOPLE FROM THE MILITARY WHICH IS ACTUALLY GOING TO COST US A LOT OF MONEY BECAUSE WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO FIND MILITARY MEMBERS TO REPLACE THOSE WHO ARE NOW BANNED. WE ARE GOING TO HAVE TO TRAIN THEM, SPEND A CONSIDERABLE AMOUNT OF RESOURCES TO MIXER THEY ARE PREPARED TO BE PART OF THE MILITARY AND SO IT'S JUST SUCH A HIM, NONSENSICAL WAY TO GO ABOUT THINGS. AND THAT IS IF HE MEANS IT. IF HE MEANS TO BAN THEM THEN IT WILL COST WHAT IS A $70,000 PER PERSON? THEIRS UP TO 15,000 PEOPLE, TRANS SERVICEMEMBERS RIGHT NOW WHO HAVE JOINED IN THE TIME OR COME OUT IN THE TIME THAT IT HAS BEEN IN EFFECT WHICH IS JUST SINCE LAST YEAR. IT IS RIDICULOUS AND WHAT IS EVEN MORE RIDICULOUS ñ WHAT I MEAN BY IF HE MEANS IT IS THOSE FOLKS, ACCORDING TO WHAT WAS ORIGINALLY LAID OUT IN ITS WE AND LATER MADE MORE FORMAL THROUGH THIS RANDOM AMBIGUOUS STATEMENT THAT GIVES A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF LEEWAY TO GENERALS TO DEFINE WHETHER THE PEOPLE WHO ARE IN THE CURRENT SERVICE ARE ALLOWED TO STAY THERE. HE'S CRAZY. IT DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE AND WHAT IS GOING TO HAPPEN IS GENERAL AFTER GENERAL HAS SAID I DON'T SEE ANY REASON WHY THEY WOULDN'T BE ALLOWED TO SERVE. THAT IS RIGHT AND KEEP IN MIND THAT THIS IS COMING AT A TIME WHEN TRUMP JUST GAVE A SPEECH ABOUT ANOTHER SURGE IN AFGHANISTAN. YOU WANT TO DEPLOY MORE TROOPS TO A FAILING WAR AND SIMULTANEOUSLY BAN AN ENTIRE GROUP OF PEOPLE FROM BEING PART OF OUR MILITARY. IT WAS A SIMILARLY AMBIGUOUS STATEMENT ABOUT A SURGE. IT WAS AN AMBIGUOUS STATEMENT ABOUT THE TRANS SERVICEMEMBERS. WE SHOULD GET THEM OUT. YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT. IT'S SIGNALING TO A BASEMENT ALL THESE FOLKS AROUND, WITH WORD FOR BOSSES LIKE THIS WERE THERE LIKE WE'RE GOING TO CHANGE AT THIS LADY LOOK AROUND GOING, HOW? THAT IS LITERALLY IMPOSSIBLE AND IT DOESN'T HELP ANYTHING. THAT IS NOT SOLVING A PROBLEM DOTTING THE MOTHER'S UP SLOWLY RIGHT WHEN SHE SAYS THINGS LIKE THESE PEOPLE HAVE ALREADY, WHO ARE ALREADY IN THE MILITARY, HAVE ARTIE PASSED CERTAIN TESTS. RANDY SAYS IT'S 2.0 TO $4.2 MILLION PER YEAR FOR THE HEALTH CONCERNS WHICH IS A TINY FRACTION OF THE $4.93 BILLION YEARLY HEALTH BUDGET. JUST OUT BUDGET THAT HOW ABOUT THIS? LET'S FOCUS ON OTHER MILITARY WASTE. WE DID A STORY COUPLE OF WEEKS AGO ABOUT HOW THE MILITARY DECIDED TO TAKE OUT A CONTRACT WITH A PRIVATE CONTRACTOR THAT MAKES UNIFORMS AND THEY SUPPLIED THESE FOREST CAMO UNIFORMS TO SOLDIERS IN AFGHANISTAN, AFGHAN SOLDIERS. FOREST CAMO. THE MAJORITY OF TERRAIN IN AFGHANISTAN IS DESERT, IT IS NOT FOREST AND WHY DID THEY DO THAT? THEY JUST WANTED TO GIVE OUT A CONTRACTOR PRIVATE CONTRACTORS TO THE TUNE OF $20 MILLION. BY THE WAY, THE US GOVERNMENT HAS UNIFORMS THEY COULD'VE GIVEN TO THE SOLDIERS FOR FREE, BUT THEY DID NOT DO THAT. PLEASE SPARE ME THE BS ABOUT WE DON'T HAVE ENOUGH RESOURCES. YOU HAVE RESOURCES, THEY ARE JUST FOR PRIVATE CONTRACTORS NOT TAKING CARE OF YOUR OWN SOLDIERS AND MEMBERS OF THE MILITARY THAT'S OF THE COUNTRY. YOU MIGHT BE WONDERING WHEN TRUMP ISSUED THE MUSLIM BAND THAT WAS STAYED IN COURT BECAUSE OF CERTAIN CASES BROUGHT AS THE PERSON FROM THE ACLU, CHASE STRANGIO, THE STAFF ATTORNEY POINTS OUT. THAT IS NOT THE CASE WITH THIS. ACCORDING TO CHASE: THAT HAS NOT HAPPENED YET. THAT IS FRUSTRATING. IT IS. BUT I COMMEND THE PEOPLE WHO ARE COURAGEOUS ENOUGH TO FIGHT TRUMP ON THIS. YOU GUYS ARE AMAZING. KEEP THE GOOD FIGHT GOING. I KNOW IT FEELS LIKE IT'S NOT GOING TO HAPPEN BUT I THINK EVENTUALLY, WE'RE GOING TO WIN.
