on the tarmac in Beijing iran's Foreign Minister says he's in China to consult with one of Iran's closest allies an important partner in pushing through the 2015 nuclear deal javad zarif snake stops include Moscow and the European Union headquarters in Brussels the European Union has made the most demands on Iran after the u.s. withdrew from the nuclear deal urging us to stay committed to the international agreement European countries must guarantee that despite the u.s. bailout the interests of the Iranian nation will be preserved but even as Iran's top diplomat is talking to world leaders Iranians at home are growing tired of the agreement altogether another session of Iran's Parliament political players placed bets take stands and make promises today no American flags were burned but they did talk about it some MPs even disagreed with what they said was an undermanned in the floor of iran's legislative body last week a school field trip is treated to a first-hand look at how iran's laws are made anti-american tirades and all but the real lesson of the day when it's all said and done governing is all about the economy Parliament has been in session for a couple of hours now and so far every issue that's been raised for discussion every these lawmakers have talked about so far has centered around the financial health of the country and one mp's message to Europe the time has come to take a stand your Appeals should appreciate the opportunity we are very serious if they want to focus on Iran they have to be independent against Americans even if sometimes it means the u.s. hits Europeans they should resist they are waiting to be independent to be a political giant we suggest to them come to be one with us and we will stand against the u.s. together no laws were passed but there was no shortage of opinions one MPs comments stood out he called for solidarity between the different branches of government warning of u.s. plans to use the nuclear issue to divide Iranians and topple the government and in the same breath he asked for another lane on the highway in his constituency a gentle reminder that all politics is local and a message to president Hassan rouhani your Parliament supports you but the nuclear deal did not work and perhaps it's time to let it go and get back to fixing problems at home Zane Basra v al Jazeera Tehran
