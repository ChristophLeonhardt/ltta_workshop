hello everyone now is everyone doing
today we are playing the four
cranberries yes then everyone we are
back with the Far Cry freeze this game
is just so amazing that we're back again
and here we are ladies gentlemen at the
highest point in Far Cry 3 look how
absolutely goddamn beautiful is God
diamond so beautiful so as you may have
noticed I have got the face cap on I did
ask you a lot of you guys in the last
Far Cry 3 video if you want to see the
face cam I know a lot of you were like
god damn I want to see the face cam so I
thought yeah I mean I know some of you
guys might not like it so I'll tell you
what we try and hit I don't know let's
do the video first and then you can
decide whether long you like the base
camp so what are we gonna do right now
so we act the highest point laser
manav's
ladies and gentlemen I have mentioned
that before but I have no I'm not good
just jump off the highest point to start
this video I want to take it a step
further and what I did is I took a bogey
all the way up
goddamn it took me a hell of a long time
told me I love my long jaw so it took me
a long time to do this but I got this
body on here and you know what we're
gonna do later and we know you know what
we're gonna do we're gonna drive this
buggy all the way down okay
here goes here we go okay
the gun exploded I'm not real high I was
kind of expecting that it happened oh my
goodness what the hell happened here so
ladies gentlemen we are back as you may
have noticed I completely changed my
clothes you know I did that for fun you
know it's not like I recorded the whole
video without hitting record or anything
okay forget about it it's in the past
okay so basically what I've been doing
is I have spent so much time throughout
my far cry free playthrough I play this
game through like three times and yet
again I have liberated every single
outpost there's like god damn 30 of them
okay it took me a hell of a long time
and what we are going to do in today's
episode lens Yemen we're gonna press
Start we're gonna go on to options we're
gonna go into gameplay and then there is
game difficulty I have been playing on
survivor difficulty but we this is got
to change guys we are not surviving in
Far Cry 3 we are not a warrior in half
our Cathy oh no we're not we are the
masters of Far Cry 3 so I am going to
set the difficulty to very hard some
people call me a madman
they're probably right but that's not
all we're going to do we are also going
to reset all 32 outposts this will reset
and make all outposts hostile again
meaning there will be so many enemies
everywhere or incomplete side missions
and quests will become hidden this
action cannot be undone
are you sure and here we are we're in
the only place that's safe and this is
the very beginning of the game
hello monkeys monkeys monkeys you ain't
gonna liberate his body going so this is
what the map looks like now oh my
goodness look how red it is all the
parts are red mean that is not safe damn
look at that ass I don't care you're 40
girl anyway so today what we are going
to do is we are going to craft a
heavy-duty
munitions pouch which will give me five
more c4 and five more mines and we are
also going to craft a heavy-duty ammo
quiver but ladies and gentlemen these
two pieces of equipment require four
so again what are you a chicken okay I'm
just going to slowly back away mr. Jack
miss Jackie it's okay it's chill don't
look give me that out okay
bye bye Jackie bye okay she stopped
clapping her hands now so ladies and
gentlemen what we're doing now is we're
heading over to an outpost okay you
thought I was gonna kill these birds go
out hunting yes because hunting bears
went so well last time come here bear
come give mesh yourself a big old bear
hug
okay ladies German we are here we are at
the outpost oh my goodness look how many
goddamn enemies there are okay so looks
like they've got a bear capture okay so
the plan is late gentlemen is to unleash
the bear hopefully the bear will kill as
many people as possible and then they
will probably kill the bear I will then
skin the vet leaving me unharmed the
plan is is to kill all of them without
raising the alarm twelve seconds later
okay so now we're gonna try another
outpost where they've captured another
poorest god damn it when are they gonna
learn you can keep Boris away from the
world
oh don't worry Boris I'll get you out of
here man I promise you that god damn it
they're using doggies as it goes it god
damn weapon oh poor doggies I don't want
to kill no doggies I didn't want to do
it okay I'm gonna take out these two
guys first there's another person
okay Boris you're gonna have to be
sacrificed okay you're gonna have these
sacrifice oh no this is not good this is
not good this is not good thank God she
Boris they get you sorry Boris I'm so
sorry
shoo-shoo shoo-shoo Brennan it's okay I
know you wanted the crab shit man I
sacrificed myself Boris you're so brave
so brave forest thank you thank you
so what we can do now is we can now crop
our heavy-duty munitions pouch and we
can now cross oh oh that second bear
didn't count okay so we have to liberate
this outpost and skin Boris the bear in
order to create our ammo quiver thingy
majiggy baba wawa okay so I made the
mistake first I'm killing this guy but I
think of what we should do first twelve
seconds later why do I suck at this game
so badly this is so much harder
I shouldn't have put it on a very hard
difficulty guys this is so goddamn
typical okay guys new plan okay I think
we need a new plan
all right we're gonna push to save with
the alarms before anything happens be
quiet be quiet be quiet
okay let's table the alarms I disable
Leon okay Boris do your things
Oh got you go - go - go - Shh everyone
be quiet
get this guy this guy Boris gonna kill
me boys I swear to God if you kill me
you bastard
I thought we won't oh my good good thing
you guys came along eh
okay so we have now skinned Boris the
bear yes craft our heavy-duty ammo
quiver but let's German we are not done
there I want the expected ammo quiver
which gives me the ability to carry 30
arrows and 10 special spots ladies and
gentlemen we need to kill and skin a
man-eater
sharkskin I might need to shock skin
even the name sounds scary magneto my
goodness is it not gonna be easy
a chef once a red man eats a shock
carpet but one with a bow provided
the specified Wi-Fi they say that one
spent specific
oh my god I sound so stupid right now
specified specify that this guy with a
bomb oh okay okay okay okay this is a
lot better position I knew you were the
one and look at him he is dead

skating man you shot it's getting me the
shock God hot shocked scared today it's
gonna meet some shock scanning me some
shock scary message doesn't tell me
twice mr. shark Jesus Christ
okay so we can now craft or extend it at
low quiver Jose yes we do yes okay so
what we're gonna do now is we're gonna
head over to the highest point again and
we're gonna fly off one last time or

life okay okay let's German we are at
the highest point yet again okay
I'm gonna end the video with another job
hopefully we won't crash and die so
quickly as last time before in the video
though I just want to say I'm not sure
if you guys liked the face cam with the
Far Cry 3 farm I've always come out next
month
so I'm gonna have to ask for a
ridiculous sign to show that you guys
definitely want them the rest of the
series to be facecam or not I thought
I'll try out to see how it goes you know
some of you might not like it some of
you may not so let me just say this if
we can hit 10,000 likes before next
week's episode okay I would make the
rest of them face cam okay and if the
wrestler in it and if we don't reach
10,000 likes then I will keep them with
no face cam you know with them is with
far cry 4 also not having face cam but
as well as all it's always up to you
okay so yeah that's pretty much it so
anyway I'm gonna end
video jumpin off okay let's go anyway
oh and thank you so much watching and I
will see you in the next video mines so
later guys
love you bye bye now
