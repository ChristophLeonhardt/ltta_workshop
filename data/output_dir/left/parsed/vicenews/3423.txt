free to go
this is our third Hyperloop competition
and I've seen them all and every year
the pods get better and better
there hasn't been any major innovation
in the transportation industry over a
hundred years
we want this Hyperloop system to be
built because it'll be like this major
web that's connecting the entire United
States maybe the entire world
in this very dark video you're gonna see
what we did at half ten last night we
made our pod go over 50 kilometers an
error in just 20 meters was the most
intense and amazing experiences of our
whole time in this competition this
loaded into the Hyperloop test track in
a vacuum has been established all
systems are go that was a great race
with the top speed of 88 miles per hour
by whoa three two one launch
when the run was finished the bus
stopped we'll all like cheering and we
were really excited and happy then when
we saw the faces of people from space
legs just like like maybe that's Bob at
the speed you saw on the screen was
broadcasted from the team's pod
however our independent check showed a
speed of around 53 miles per hour
what you're doing here is one of those
things that makes people excited about
the future those things are rare and
actually energizes me about the future
that you guys so excited about doing
this
it's really something it's like it's
next-level stuff cares lations
this year we're participating in the
third competition and so far we've won
the first two competitions and we're
trying to defend our title now hopefully
being about the fastest quad yet again
we have had some issues with our pot but
we're confident that we'll get to
roughly our target speed which is
between 500 and 600 meters an hour
all righty folks we are ready three two
one and don't
Barba's just achieved 284 miles an hour
this represents a new Hyperloop test
track record just an awesome feeling and
just disbelief really actually have
arrived here and to have one competition
after all this time just looking at the
video of it it was clear that most
faster than last year so yeah they're
really celebrating right now
sure toy
you
