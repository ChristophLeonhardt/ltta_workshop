00:01:09,585 --> 00:01:10,219
THESE NEGOTIATIONS WAS A

28
00:01:10,219 --> 00:01:19,228
POSITION OF STRENGTH NOT ONLY

MILITARILY BUT ECONOMICALLY AND

30
00:01:19,962 --> 00:01:20,563
DIPLOMATICALLY AS WELL.

31
00:01:20,563 --> 00:01:21,297
SECONDLY HE GOT TO KEEP IN MIND

32
00:01:21,297 --> 00:01:22,031
AND NOT KEEP IN MIND BUT KEEP IN

33
00:01:22,031 --> 00:01:25,901
THE FOREFRONT THE NUMBER ONE

34
00:01:25,901 --> 00:01:27,403
OBJECTIVE IS DENUCLEARIZATION OF

35
00:01:27,403 --> 00:01:28,070
NUCLEAR -- THE NORTH KOREAN

36
00:01:28,070 --> 00:01:28,437

41
00:01:36,245 --> 00:01:40,015
IRRESISTIBLE, NOT IRRESISTIBLE

42
00:01:40,015 --> 00:01:41,684
BUT IRREVERSIBLE WITH REGARD TO

43
00:01:41,684 --> 00:01:42,251
THE DENUCLEARIZATION.

44
00:01:42,251 --> 00:01:47,723
THAT IS A VERY TALL ORDER.

45
00:01:47,723 --> 00:01:49,925
IT WILL BE TOUGH GOING.

46
00:01:49,925 --> 00:01:50,593
JILLIAN: YOU HAVE TWO SIDES

47
00:01:50,593 --> 00:01:53,596
WILLING TO GIVE UP A LITTLE BIT

48
00:01:53,596 --> 00:01:54,163
TO GET SOMETHING ELSE.

49
00:01:54,163 --> 00:02:03,506
WHAT IF NORTH KOREA DOESN'T WANT

50
00:02:03,506 --> 00:02:04,240
TO COMPLETELY DENUCLEARIZE, WHAT

51
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:04,940
DO YOU SEE DONALD TRUMP DOING?

52
00:02:04,940 --> 00:02:05,574

53
00:02:05,574 --> 00:02:06,242
NEGOTIATING TABLE, BRINGING

54
00:02:06,242 --> 00:02:09,678

00:02:10,378 --> 00:02:10,679
WELL.

57
00:02:10,679 --> 00:02:17,119
IT IS IN EVERYONE'S INTEREST TO

58
00:02:17,119 --> 00:02:17,853
DENUCLEARIZE PARTICULARLY IF KIM

59
00:02:17,853 --> 00:02:20,489
WANTS TO MOVE FORWARD WITH HIS

60
00:02:20,489 --> 00:02:21,957
OWN EFFORTS TO HELP THE ECONOMIC

61
00:02:21,957 --> 00:02:31,901
SITUATION NOT ONLY FOR HIM BUT

62
00:02:31,901 --> 00:02:32,535
NORTH KOREA AS THEY MOVE

63
00:02:32,535 --> 00:02:32,868
FORWARD.

64
00:02:32,868 --> 00:02:33,602
THE OTHER THING TO KEEP IN MIND

65
00:02:33,602 --> 00:02:34,336
IS TIME IS ON EVERYONE'S SIDE I

66
00:02:34,336 --> 00:02:35,738
BELIEVE.

67
00:02:35,738 --> 00:02:38,040
THIS IS GOING TO BE A LENGTHY

68
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:38,774
PROCESS NOT JUST THE JUNE 12TH

69
00:02:38,774 --> 00:02:39,341
SUMMIT BUT WHAT COMES

70
00:02:39,341 --> 00:02:42,711
AFTERWARDS, WHAT COMES IN THE

71
00:02:42,711 --> 00:02:47,449
ENSUING NEGOTIATIONS AND WHAT

72
00:02:47,449 --> 00:02:48,150
WILL CERTAINLY BE MULTIPARTY

73
00:02:48,150 --> 00:02:48,818
TALKS WITH THE US AND AS I

74
00:02:48,818 --> 00:02:51,053
MENTIONED WITH JAPAN AND CHINA

75
00:02:51,053 --> 00:02:51,387
AS WELL.

76
00:02:51,387 --> 00:02:55,024
WE GOING WITH OUR EYES WIDE

77
00:02:55,024 --> 00:02:56,926
OPEN, NORTH KOREA, SOUTH KOREA

78
00:02:56,926 --> 00:03:04,600
HAVE BEEN AT WAR.

79
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:05,267
ALL WE HAVE IS AN ARMISTICE

80
00:03:05,267 --> 00:03:05,935
SINCE THE WAR BROKE OUT ON

81
00:03:05,935 --> 00:03:06,936
JUNE 25, 1950.

82
00:03:06,936 --> 00:03:07,603
THERE HAVE BEEN GENERATIONS

83
00:03:07,603 --> 00:03:13,509
WHERE THIS IS BEEN AN UNSTABLE

84
00:03:13,509 --> 00:03:15,711
SITUATIONS.

85
00:03:15,711 --> 00:03:16,745
THEY ARE A LOT TALLER.

86
00:03:16,745 --> 00:03:19,548
>> SEEMS LIKE A TALL ORDER.

87
00:03:19,548 --> 00:03:22,751
THAT MOVED TO ANOTHER PART OF

88
00:03:22,751 --> 00:03:25,855
THE WORLD, WE HAVE THIS

89
00:03:25,855 --> 00:03:33,062
SITUATION WITH IRAN AND ISRAEL

90
00:03:33,062 --> 00:03:33,762
FIRING MISSILES AT EACH OTHER

91
00:03:33,762 --> 00:03:34,363
AND THIS HAS ESCALATED.

92
00:03:34,363 --> 00:03:35,097
THE UNITED STATES PULLED OUT OF

93
00:03:35,097 --> 00:03:39,068
THE IRAN DEAL AMID SO MUCH

94
00:03:39,068 --> 00:03:39,768
CRITICISM, THE REASON IRAN IS

95
00:03:39,768 --> 00:03:40,502
LINED UP IN SYRIA IS WE PUMPED

96
00:03:40,502 --> 00:03:41,237
SO MUCH MONEY INTO THEIR ECONOMY

97
00:03:41,237 --> 00:03:43,505
BECAUSE OF THAT DEAL.

98
00:03:43,505 --> 00:03:46,942
WE HAVE ALLOWED THEM TO ARM UP

99
00:03:46,942 --> 00:03:51,180
AND SET UP OTHER FACTIONS THAT

100
00:03:51,180 --> 00:03:51,714
ARE ANTI-ISRAEL.

101
00:03:51,714 --> 00:03:57,553
IS THIS NOT WHY WE PULLED OUT OF

102
00:03:57,553 --> 00:03:57,920
THE DEAL?

103
00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:01,423
>> IRAN IS THE LEADING STATE

104
00:04:01,423 --> 00:04:01,991
SPONSOR OF TERRORISM.

105
00:04:01,991 --> 00:04:11,867
AND WHAT WE HAD THURSDAY

106
00:04:11,867 --> 00:04:14,470
MORNING, ENCOURAGE AND ATTACK

107
00:04:14,470 --> 00:04:18,339
FROM THE GOLAN HEIGHTS AREA INTO

108
00:04:18,339 --> 00:04:19,074
ISRAEL ATTACKING ISRAELI DEFENSE

109
00:04:19,074 --> 00:04:22,311
FORCES IN A ROBUST FASHION, MORE

110
00:04:22,311 --> 00:04:22,978
SO THAN WE HAVE SEEN IN A 7

111
00:04:22,978 --> 00:04:27,316
YEAR. GO OF THE SYRIAN WAR.

112
00:04:27,316 --> 00:04:33,155
IRAN BEING MUCH MORE ENTRENCHED

113
00:04:33,155 --> 00:04:37,293
AND INVOLVED WITH THE SYRIAN

114
00:04:37,293 --> 00:04:37,960
CIVIL WAR BACKING UP ASIDE.

115
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:41,363
ISRAEL SEES THAT AS A THREAT AND

116
00:04:41,363 --> 00:04:42,097
THEY RESPONDED SIGNIFICANTLY IN

117
00:04:42,097 --> 00:04:48,404
THIS CASE.

118
00:04:48,404 --> 00:04:54,109
I WOULD HOPE BOTH SIDES DAMP

119
00:04:54,109 --> 00:04:54,410
DOWN.

120
00:04:54,410 --> 00:00:00,000
AND THE NEXT SEVERAL DAYS IF NOT
