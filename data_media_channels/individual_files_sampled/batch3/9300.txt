BY KIM JONG-UN MAY SOON BE RELEASED. WE HAVE THIS. OPENING MONOLOGUE. RIGHT HERE ON THE PROGRAM, WE DID SOMETHING THAT YOU DON'T SEE FROM SO- CALLED JOURNALIST. YEAH, WE BROKE NEWS. WE HAD A INTERVIEW WITH RUDY GUILIANI AND REPORTS INSIGHT IN THE LEGAL TEAM. AND NOW RUDY GUILIANI CALLED OUT ROBERT MUELLER'S WITCH HUNT. THE PRESIDENT RIGHT WHEN HE SAID WITCH HUNT IN YES, YOU CAN'T EXPLAIN IT ANY OTHER WAY. FIRST OF ALL THERE WAS NO RUSSIANCLUSION AND SHOULDN'T BE A INVESTIGATION. WE ARE YEAR AND HALF AND TWO YEARS IN THIS. NO RUSSIANCLUSION. IN FALLING ALL OVER THEMSELVES. THEY COMMITTED NUMEROUS VIOLATIONS. Sean: GUILIANI SLAMMED THE SPECIAL COUNSEL'S QUESTIONS THAT WERE RECENTLY LEAKED TO THE NEW YORK TIMES. WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE QUESTIONS ABOUT WHAT DOES THE PRESIDENT THINK OR FEEL, WHAT DOES THE PRESIDENT REALLY DESIRE, THOSE ARE QUESTIONS INTENDED TO TRAP HIM IN SOME WAY IN CONTRADICT WHAT IS IN FACT A VERY, VERY SOLID EXPLANATION OF WHAT HAPPENED. Sean: THE FORMER MAYOR IS ABSOLUTELY RIGHT AND ROBERT MUELLER SETS A PERJURY TRAP, THERE IS A SUBPEONA FOR MANAFORT. MUELLER HAS THE POWER TO SUBPEONA SO LONG AS HE WRITES THE NAME ON THE PAPER BEFORE HE SERVES THE DOCUMENTS. WHAT IS SEEMINGLY AN AGGRESSIVE LEGAL TACTIC AND ONE THAT WE EXPECT FROM HIM. MORE FROM MY SIT DOWN WITH THE MAYOR. THE MEDIA PAID LITTLE ATTENTION TO. PAY ATTENTION NOW ABOUT HILLARY CLINTON. 13 CRIMES SHE COMMITTED AND WE GOT UP TO 18. I AM SORRY, I KNOW YOU ARE DISAPPOINTED YOU DIDN'T WIN, BUT YOU ARE CRIMINAL. EQUAL JUSTICE WOULD MEAN YOU SHOULD GO TO JAIL. I DON'T KNOW WHY THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT IS NOT INVESTIGATING YOU. Sean: EQUAL JUSTICE MEANS HILLARY GOES TO JAIL. HE TOOK ON FORMER FBI DIRECTOR JAMES COMEY. YOU HAVE AN INVESTIGATION IN WHICH MUELLER IS SELECTED THE DAY AFTER HE'S TURNED DOWN BY FBI DIRECT OR BY ROSENSTEIN. THERE ARE THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE WHO COULD BE SELECTED FROM THE JOB AND JAMES COMEY SEEMS TO BE THEIR CORE OF THEIR INVESTIGATION. HE'S TELLING THE TRUTH AND PRESIDENT ISN'T? I KNOW JAMES COMEY AND I KNOW THE PRESIDENT. SORRY, JIM, YOU ARE A LIAR. A DISGRACEFUL LIAR AND EVERY FBI IN AMERICA HAS HIS HEAD DOWN BECAUSE OF YOU. Sean: THE FORMER MAYOR SLAMMED THE FBI HANDLING OF THE MICHAEL COHENINVESTIGATION. LOOK AT THIS. THE SETTLEMENT WHICH IS REGULAR THING FOR LAWYERS TO DO. ONLY POSSIBLE WOULD BE IS WHETHER A CAMPAIGN FINANCE. AND AS A RESULTS IN A FINE AND NOT STORM TROOPERS BREAKING DOWN HIS APARTMENT AND OFFICE. Sean: LET'S TAKE A STEP BACK. ALL OF THOSE CRUCIAL DEVELOPMENTS THAT YOU JUST WATCHED AND WE AIRED LIVE ON THIS PROGRAM, WERE LARGELY IGNORED BY THE ABUSIVE BIASSED NEW'S MEDIA INSTEAD THE LAZY, ABUSIVE BIASSED ECHO CHAMBER "FAKE NEWS" OVER PAID MEDIA ERUPTED 130 SECOND CLIP AGAIN AND AGAIN AND AGAIN. TAKE A LOOK. HAVING TO PAY STORMY DANIELS WOMAN 130000? THAT WILL BE TURN OUT TO BE PERFECTLY ALMOST. THAT MONEY WAS NOT CAMPAIGN MONEY. I AM GIVING YOU A FACT THAT YOU DON'T KNOW. IT IS NOT CAMPAIGN MONEY. NO CAMPAIGN FINANCE VIOLATION. Sean: SO THEY FUNNELED FUNDED BY THE LAW FARM. Sean: IT DOESN'T CHANGE THE FACT AND PURPOSE OF THE PAYMENT INITIALLY OR A LONG TIME UNTIL AFTER THE TRANSACTION TOOK PLACE AND MICHAEL COHEN, TOOK THE ACTION TO BENEFIT THE COMPANY HE SERVEMENT FOLLOW THE BOUNCING BALL SO YOU CAN KEEP UP. WALL STREET JOURNAL REPORTED ABOUT THE COHEN, PAYMENT TO STORMY DANIELS THAT HAPPENED BEFORE THE ELECTION AND IN FEBRUARY IN AN INTERVIEW WITH THE NEW YORK TIMES, MICHAEL COHENDENIED THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN REIMBURSED HIM. HE LEFT OPEN THE POSSIBILITY THAT THE PRESIDENT HIMSELF THEN PRESIDENT-ELECT AT THE TIME MIGHT HAVE REIMBURSED HIM WITH PERSONAL FUNDS. AND PRESIDENT TRUMP SAID THIS ON BOARD OF A FORCE ONE. DID YOU KNOW ABOUT THE PAYMENT? YOU HAVE TO REQUEST MICHAEL COHEN, MY ATTORNEY. YOU WILL HAVE TO ASK MICHAEL. NOW THE PRESIDENT OBVIOUSLY KNEW ABOUT THE STORY AT THIS TIME. IT WAS SO WIDELY REPORTED SINCE JANUARY AND WHAT HE SAID, HE DIDN'T KNOW ABOUT THE PAYMENT PRIOR TO THE STORY BEING COVERED. THIS DID NOT STOP THE HYSTERIA OF THE MAINSTREAM MEDIA WITH A FEVER PITCH LIKE THE RUSSIA, STORY. I DID NOT WATCH ALL OF YOUR SHOW. RUDY GUILIANI WENT ON FOX NEWS AND HE STAYED ON LONGER THAN HE IS HAVE, THAT'S WHEN HE GOT TO THE STORMY DANIELS. WHICH IS BLOCKBUSTER. AND HE COULD BE OUT THERE DEFENDING THE PRESIDENT AND TAKE A HARDER LINE WHEN IT CAME TO THE MUELLER INVESTIGATION. BUT HE CREATED ANOTHER MYTH. THERE IS AN ASSUMPTION THAT RUDDY GUILIANI HAD A STRATEGY AND I AM UNCONVINCED THAT THAT IS THE CASE. HAD RUDY GUILIANI BEEN COUNSEL FOR IBM AND UNDERCUT IBM LIKE HE DID FOR THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES HE WOULD BE FIRED NEXT MORNING. THE HERO OF 9/11 IS FORGOTTEN AND SEVERELY DAMAGED HIS LEGACY. WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF GUILIANI'S LEGAL STRATEGY. HE MET PHORICALLY MURDERED THE PRESIDENT AND COMMITTED SUICIDE WITH RESPECT TO HIS OWN REPUTATION. Sean: 24 HOUR COVERAGE WAS OBSESSIVE AND IT WAS ALMOST FUNNY EXCEPT THAT IT IS TOO SERIOUS. TAKE A LOOK. STUNNING REVELATION FROM PRESIDENT TRUMP'S ATTORNEY RUDY GUILIANI. LAST NIGHT TESTIFYING FOX NEWS THAT TRUMP REIMBURSEMENT HIS FIXER. IT WAS A STUNNING ADMISSION THAT GUILIANI SAID APPROVED BY HIS BOSS THE PRESIDENT AND OFFERING A CONTRADICTORY ACCOUNT ABOUT THE PAYMENT TO STORMY DANIELS. AFTER SAYING HE DIDN'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT THE HUSH PAYMENT. AND NOW HE REIMBURSED HIS LAWYER. STARTLING ADMISSION BY RUDY GUILIANI HAS PRESIDENT TRUMP FACING NEW QUESTIONS ABOUT WHETHER HE KNEW ABOUT THE ATTEMPT TO SILENCE STORMY DANIELS. Sean: THE MEDIA CAN'T STOP PLAYING THE SHOW AND HANNITY AND THEY FEATURE ME MORE THAN THEIR OWN HOSTS. I AM BEGINNING TO THINK I NEED TO COLLECT A PAYCHECK FROM ABC, CBS, AND NBC, AND MSNBC. AND I AM PROVIDING THE REAL NEWS THAT THEY RARELY MAKE ON THEIR OWN. TURN TO EVEN MORE "FAKE NEWS". THIS IS SERIOUS. NBC BROKE A SERIOUS STORY ABOUT MICHAEL COHEN. ACCORDING TO THE ORIGINAL REPORT. COHEN, HAD BEEN WIRETAPPED WEEKS BEFORE HE WAS RAIDED BY THE FBI. AND THERE WAS MORE DEVELOPMENTS BY NBC NEWS. THE WIRETAP OCCURRED BEFORE THE PUBLIC SEARCH WARRANT. AND IN ADDITION TO THAT, WE LEARNED THAT ONE PHONE CALL CONVERSATION BETWEEN MICHAEL COHENAND THE WHITE HOUSE WAS INTERCEPTED AND WE KNOW THAT FEDERAL PROSECUTOR CONDUCTED A SURVEILLANCE OF HIS E-MAILS LEADING UP TO A SEARCH WARRANT. THIS IS MORE THAN KNOCKING ON THE DOOR AND ASKING FOR DOCUMENTLESS. Sean: AND ONCE AGAIN WE LEARNED THAT THIS REPORT WAS "FAKE NEWS" AND NBC WAS FORCED TO REPORT. THREE SENIOR OFFICIALS DISPUTE THE WIRETAPPING AND THE MONITORING OF COHEN'S CALL WAS
