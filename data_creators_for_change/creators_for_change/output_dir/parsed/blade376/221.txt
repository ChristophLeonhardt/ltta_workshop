another day is just another box on the
calendar that needs filling look in the
papers it appears are filled with all
these stories of hurt corruption
injustice that floods this world dr. man
hands large words before departing this
world for good were nothing else nothing
ever ends and he was right society still
engulfed with fear and despair who is
watching the watchmen was sensor release
the movie in a purse everyone is
therefore intensities society's
unappreciated heroes are revealed not
good if only I could find people out
there who would want to form a new group
those willing to take a stand up in just
as humanity truly deserves but who would
join me
