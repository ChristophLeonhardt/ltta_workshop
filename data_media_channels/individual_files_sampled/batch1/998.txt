you can't live like this with any dignity where this Roma community is forced to try the municipality stops rubbish collection years ago so it's piled up everywhere as people try to sell scrap there's barely running water so they have to improvise everything most are Italian citizens and many work but they won't show their faces because they fear their employers would fire them if their identities are discovered Matteo salvini the leader of the far rights League party routinely tweets that they are gypsy thieves and he will bulldoze their camps of course the Roma people have seen all the messages and they're outraged it's pure propaganda it's racism the words Ingary gypsy shouldn't be used at all he talks about bulldozers as if he will be the one to come and clean up the camps he shouldn't be a politician he should do something else the threats are already attracting the attention of human rights advocates even before the new government is formed these politicians don't realize what the situation is you can't expel Italians the ones from the former Yugoslavia are either here legally or they are stateless so no country and take them back in the election here nearly one in five Italians voted for the league part in so plainly it isn't difficult to convince angry disillusioned people that Europe cares more about outsiders than ethnic Italians of course whether or not they're serious about bulldozing these places and trying to deport European citizens there's a different question about the sort of language that's been used and its consequences in the new government mr. salvini would be in charge of Home Affairs the police and immigration during the election campaign a Nigerian migrant savagely murdered an Italian woman and salvini said this you know one more year when I get an 18 year old girl should not die cut into two pieces and put into a suitcase because of Nigerian illegal migrant drug pusher who was wandering around Italy freely the next day a man draped in the Italian flag shot several migrants in the the Italian town amateur Otto mr. salvini would of course deny he is speaking for a fascist fringe but rather for millions of Italian people angry that they've been left to deal with a massive immigration problem by themselves nor is Italy the only country threatening mass deportations Germany is currently trying to remove 30,000 Nigerians but there is no question that threats are parts of the new politics in Italy lawrence lee al jazeera outside rome
