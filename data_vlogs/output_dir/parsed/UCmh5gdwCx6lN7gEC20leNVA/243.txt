oh yeah so I've noticed that a lot of
youtubers do this when they get enough
support from you guys is that they go
out and they buy their parents a brand
new car so instead of being like every
other youtuber I'm gonna go out and buy
myself a brand new car because if you
really think about who deserves it more
my immigrant parents who came here from
a foreign country risking everything
they had just to better the lives of
their children or me a 20 year old who
post three times a week three times or
what I can't do this like no but
seriously I'm so thankful that I'm
really bad at expressing thankfulness if
that's a word if I didn't have you guys
watching my videos I would have had to
steal this car and if I had to steal it
then I'd probably end up in jail so
thanks for watching my videos and
keeping me out of prison
no but enjoy the rest of video I'm
really thankful I just don't know how to
show it okay alright bye bye bye you

picking up another stupid animal huh
