occupy London appears to be the latest victim of Facebook's recent spree of shutting down pages the social justice movement had its page taken down for several hours the movement says this is not the first time Facebook has tried to censor its content occupy London is a social justice movement founded in 2011 it's part of a global movement that's organized hundreds of protests against financial elites the movement says it's our founding values are equality and diversity occupy London has a significant social media presence about a hundred and fifty thousand followers on Facebook now some say that certain pro-palestine posts by Occupy London may be to blame for Facebook's action we asked Facebook for a comment the social media giant has since apologized to Occupy London saying it was all a big mistake George Bardo one of the movements activists is not convinced if it were just a you know a sort of a blip and mistake out of the blue it wouldn't probably wouldn't mean very much at all but the problem is this is part of a massive rearguard action I think by the establishment you know anyone can go online and see the evidence of this themselves and Chris Hedges who's a Pulitzer Prize winning journalist has been one of those exposing most that the details of this but effectively what's happened is it in the name of dealing with fake news and many progressive websites that have been a major part of you know Bernie Sanders Jeremy Corbyn etc they found their traffic going down you know sickening um websites like AlterNet TruthDig that are you know mainstream progressive websites have seen their traffic go down by 70 percent literally and these are algorithms devised in private that nobody can inspect and that have a huge impact on what information the world gets to see about what's going on and that's a hugely significant issue going forward the relevant thing today in terms of our discussion is that occupy is still a very powerful force online and has millions of people engaging with its posts and so it's very important that they and others like them are not in the name of fake news effectively removed from most people's internet searches and I think this is a huge issue going forward bear in mind that Google and Facebook are very very close to the American establishment you know the Washington Post is owned by Jeff Bezos who also owns and and not surprisingly he's very keen on using the Washington Post to make sure that the Internet allows his articles to come up at the top researchers in neurons you
