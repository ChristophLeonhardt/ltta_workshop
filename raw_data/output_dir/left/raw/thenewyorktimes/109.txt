1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,430
The following audio is
part of a conversation

2
00:00:02,430 --> 00:00:05,310
with Donald Trump that his
then lawyer, Michael Cohen,

3
00:00:05,310 --> 00:00:09,120
secretly recorded two months
before the 2016 election.

4
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:18,600
[Transcript is in dispute.]

5
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:21,710
As you can hear, the audio 
abruptly cuts off at the end.

6
00:00:21,710 --> 00:00:23,820
The two appear to be
discussing payments

7
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:25,290
to a former Playboy model

8
00:00:25,290 --> 00:00:27,130
who said she had 
an affair with Trump.

9
00:00:27,130 --> 00:00:28,970
There was a real 
relationship there.

10
00:00:28,970 --> 00:00:31,460
There were real feelings
between the two of us.

11
00:00:31,460 --> 00:00:33,810
Several things in the
exchange are in dispute

12
00:00:33,810 --> 00:00:35,670
by legal teams on each side.

13
00:00:35,670 --> 00:00:37,560
So, we’re not subtitling the video.

14
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:39,540
Let’s play it one
more time.

15
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:49,220
[Transcript is in dispute.]

16
00:00:49,220 --> 00:00:51,180
Cohen’s lawyer seems to suggest

17
00:00:51,180 --> 00:00:53,320
that Trump wanted
the payment to be secret

18
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:54,570
because he wanted it in cash.

19
00:00:54,570 --> 00:00:58,140
“Everybody heard just
now Donald Trump

20
00:00:58,140 --> 00:01:02,370
say the word ‘cash, cash’

21
00:01:02,370 --> 00:01:05,190
after Michael Cohen 
mentioned financing.

22
00:01:05,190 --> 00:01:07,460
The only people who use cash

23
00:01:07,460 --> 00:01:10,460
are drug dealers and mobsters.”

24
00:01:10,460 --> 00:01:12,420
Trump’s lawyer says
the tape clears

25
00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:13,760
the president of wrongdoing.

26
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:16,260
“The transcript makes it
quite clear at the end,

27
00:01:16,260 --> 00:01:18,340
that President Trump says,

28
00:01:18,340 --> 00:01:20,780
quote, ‘Don’t pay with cash.’

29
00:01:20,780 --> 00:01:23,470
There's no indication of 
any crime being committed

30
00:01:23,470 --> 00:01:24,650
on this date.”

31
00:01:24,650 --> 00:01:27,110
So, what could the
leaked tapes show?

32
00:01:27,110 --> 00:01:28,600
Trump had knowledge
about the hush payment,

33
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:30,696
although his campaign
has denied it.

34
00:01:30,696 --> 00:01:32,330
The use of cash may
have been an effort

35
00:01:32,330 --> 00:01:34,090
to keep the payments secret.

36
00:01:34,090 --> 00:00:00,000
Or, Trump may have violated
campaign finance laws.
