1
00:00:02,360 --> 00:00:03,860
So you've arrived in Myanmar and

2
00:00:03,860 --> 00:00:06,890
managed to convert your cash
to kyat, the local currency.

3
00:00:06,890 --> 00:00:10,290
But what do you do if you don't want
to carry huge stacks of dirty bills?

4
00:00:10,290 --> 00:00:11,150
>> It's already closed.

5
00:00:11,150 --> 00:00:12,180
It's already closed.

6
00:00:13,420 --> 00:00:16,130
>> After years of reporting for the
country, I've got a little secret.

7
00:00:18,270 --> 00:00:22,385
I like to come right here, just off
Merchant Street in Yangon, where for

8
00:00:22,385 --> 00:00:25,893
a price you can replace torn,
stained kyat notes with fresh,

9
00:00:25,893 --> 00:00:26,718
clean bills.

10
00:00:26,718 --> 00:00:29,163
>> Where are the,
you have new notes?

11
00:00:29,163 --> 00:00:30,163
>> [FOREIGN]
>> Yeah.

12
00:00:30,163 --> 00:00:31,080
>> Are they videotaping?

13
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:31,700
>> Oh.

14
00:00:31,700 --> 00:00:32,790
They don't want that camera.

15
00:00:32,790 --> 00:00:33,980
>> Oh, I forgot to add.

16
00:00:33,980 --> 00:00:36,030
I'm not sure this is entirely legal.

17
00:00:36,030 --> 00:00:37,920
Technically, money
exchanges need to be done

18
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:39,530
at government approved
money changers.

19
00:00:39,530 --> 00:00:40,938
Zaw Lin!

20
00:00:40,938 --> 00:00:44,853
Can you come here?
I can't speak [English].

21
00:00:44,853 --> 00:00:46,212
>> He often comes here
to exchange money.

22
00:00:46,212 --> 00:00:48,057
>> Yes it's true.

23
00:00:48,057 --> 00:00:49,262
>> You want to take 500 bills?

24
00:00:49,262 --> 00:00:51,016
>> They are taking photos.

25
00:00:51,016 --> 00:00:53,054
>> No, they are just taking
photos of his dollars.

26
00:00:53,054 --> 00:00:56,173
>> No, no 5,000, understand?

27
00:00:56,173 --> 00:00:57,760
>> I think he is saying 1000 bills.

28
00:00:57,760 --> 00:00:58,383
>> You mean like this?

29
00:00:58,383 --> 00:00:59,560
No.
>> [FOREIGN]

30
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:02,137
>> This one.

31
00:01:02,137 --> 00:01:02,925
Yeah?

32
00:01:02,925 --> 00:01:04,461
>> Oh, you mean 5,000 bills.
>> No.

33
00:01:04,461 --> 00:01:09,679
>> We don't have them.

34
00:01:09,679 --> 00:01:10,393
>> Maybe.
Okay.

35
00:01:10,393 --> 00:01:12,330
500 okay?

36
00:01:12,330 --> 00:01:13,210
500?

37
00:01:13,210 --> 00:01:17,961
>> It might be a little sketchy, but

38
00:01:17,961 --> 00:00:00,000
I get what I came for in no time.
