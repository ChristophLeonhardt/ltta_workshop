the US state of North Carolina has been ordered to redraw its congressional map which shows how the state is divided into voting districts it comes after Republicans there admitted to gerrymandering manipulating borders for political gain caleb Maupin takes a closer look here's an old political hack courtesy of US politicians redraw the voting districts in order to favor your party that's what the Republican Party did in North Carolina in 2016 but they went too far the federal courts have stepped in and said that they violated the US Constitution we to the extent are going to use political data in drawing this map it is to gain partisan advantage on the map partisan gerrymandering runs contrary to numerous fundamental democratic principles and individual rights let's take a look at how the 12th congressional district in North Carolina was drawn now that's clearly not exactly a random sampling of the population but that's not the only place that happens all across the country this is an old trick in u.s. politics it even has a name gerrymandering the process of redrawing district lines to give an advantage to one party over another imagine that we have a state of 50 people 20 of them are Democrats 30 Republicans blues living on one side of the state and Reds on the other now the state needs to be divided into districts with each sending one representative to the house first option to divide them into five separate districts horizontally with three Republican representatives and two Democrats but if the Republican Party in the state is more powerful it can be divided in the Reds favor with each district getting six Republicans and four Democrats which means that all the representatives will be Republican and vice versa say the democratic party controls the state then its territory can be divided into districts in quite a chaotic way in order to give more House representation for Democrats so even though the state has a Republican majority Democrats win three seats and Republicans only two it's constitutionally infirm you know parties are not supposed to read istrict in order to give any party political advantage again we know that happened the courts are tired of these this gerrymandering they're tired particularly of racial gerrymandering which everyone knows is happening and they want it to stop and I think therefore that a lot of this redistricting in any case even aside from what happened here is going to be looked at more closely by the court but usually it's done in more subtle ways here they did in a very blatant way there was evidence that they did it for political reasons and so I think it was easy for the court to reach the decision they did the founding fathers of the United States extolled the virtues of representative government but it looks like a loophole in the Constitution they created has enabled a situation to come into existence in which instead of people choosing their politicians politicians get to choose their voters caleb Maupin RT New York
