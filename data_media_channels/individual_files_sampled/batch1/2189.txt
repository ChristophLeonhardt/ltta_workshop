so I'm about to go up on a zero gravity flight with the zero-g corporation I'm here in Newark New Jersey we fly a thing called a parabolic arc we'll start it around 20,000 feet we'll go as fast as we can about 1.8 GS on the way up and when we get to the predetermined speed to get slow enough I start to push over and as I push over I'm just lowering the nose and pushing for zero gravity and the passengers in the back will just lift off the floor and become weightless then again once we're about 45 degrees nose-down we start the recovery will bring everybody back down to the floor nice and smooth and roll under the next parabola it keep it very basic I think it's written one croissant that should be enough I'm very excited it's so excited that your training video got me pumped so there's going to be so many different things you can try and they told you what not to do there swimming and of jumping so very excited it is a really big demographic actually except 60% man about 40% women but the age range is everything from 8 years old up to 93 yeah I'm exhilarated because of what I just went through and experience and I want more it was so cool and I want to experience more sustained zero-g at some point I definitely want to do this again and I hope that you know in my lifetime I hope that that regular people like me will be able to go up to space and experience these sensations in a more sustained environment but I recommend this to anybody who has the means to do it very lucky I was invited to do it and and I would absolutely go again in a heartbeat I would go again right now if they said hey anybody else when we go for a ride I would raise my hand immediately
