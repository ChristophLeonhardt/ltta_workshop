1
00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:03,290
Chameleons are known
for changing color.

2
00:00:03,290 --> 00:00:06,570
But their powers are
more than just skin-deep.

3
00:00:06,570 --> 00:00:10,050
They fire their tongues out
to capture insects to eat.

4
00:00:10,050 --> 00:00:12,180
And those are some tongues —

5
00:00:12,180 --> 00:00:15,450
usually about
two times body length.

6
00:00:15,450 --> 00:00:17,730
Now, a scientist
at Brown University

7
00:00:17,730 --> 00:00:20,310
has found that the
smallest chameleons

8
00:00:20,310 --> 00:00:22,960
pack an extra punch.

9
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:25,810
This is Rhampholeon spinosus.

10
00:00:25,810 --> 00:00:27,910
It’s just under
2 inches long.

11
00:00:27,910 --> 00:00:29,920
Its tongue shoots
out to about

12
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:32,689
two and a half times
that body length

13
00:00:32,689 --> 00:00:34,000
and accelerates so fast,

14
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,230
it’s pulling about 264 Gs.

15
00:00:38,230 --> 00:00:40,780
That acceleration
and the power output

16
00:00:40,780 --> 00:00:45,160
of 14,000 watts per kilogram,
top any known movement

17
00:00:45,160 --> 00:00:48,100
by any reptile,
bird or mammal.

18
00:00:48,100 --> 00:00:51,310
The researchers found that the
smaller chameleons in general

19
00:00:51,310 --> 00:00:53,320
packed a bigger punch.

20
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:55,540
The reason seems to be
that smaller animals tend

21
00:00:55,540 --> 00:00:57,850
to have higher
metabolisms, so they

22
00:00:57,850 --> 00:01:02,800
need to eat more per pound,
or per fraction of an ounce.

23
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:04,780
To do that, these
chameleons evolved

24
00:01:04,780 --> 00:01:08,650
an oversized, souped-up
feeding mechanism.

25
00:01:08,650 --> 00:01:10,750
Apparently, power
to the little

26
00:01:10,750 --> 00:00:00,000
is an evolutionary maxim.
