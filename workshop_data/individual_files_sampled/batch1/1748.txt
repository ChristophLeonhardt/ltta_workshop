carlos and his family have been living in Colombia for three months illegally a lack of medicine and food for their three-year-old daughter Rosie left him no choice but to leave Venezuela when they heard the Colombian government was registering migrants in the country without the threat of deportation they wanted to be first in line we saw it as an opportunity hoping it will bring us benefit in the future they asked for all their personal information and about a health condition and of the baby in particular massive numbers of desperate Venezuelans have arrived in the past year the authorities say they could number more than half a million but there's no exact figure that's why it launched the registration we want to know how many migrants there are and in what condition so we can measure what services we can offer an estimate costs because it's very expensive the basics are health and education services the Colombian government has set up more than 500 registration points like this one across the country they will operate for the next two months this is a major humanitarian emergency especially for a country that as never before had to deal with such a massive influx of migrants the United Nations is assisting and says Colombia can't be left alone to deal with the exodus the arrival of the Venezuelan population is a regional issue it's not only Colombian so it's time to start a more coordinated effort across Latin America and hopefully this can be the first step Colombian police and soldiers have been deployed to support the effort those being counted include mothers with small children some of the women are pregnant with no money for a room many sleep on the streets we are all just here hoping to work to help ourselves and those back home hopefully this will help formalize her situation I'm pregnant she's got five children they're all hungry and cold at night the Colombian government has made it more difficult for Venezuelans to cross the border but with no end in sight to the troubles in the country stemming the flow is one challenge for the authorities and the people corrupt in the crisis Alessandra p80 al-jazeera c√∫cuta
