1
00:00:00,764 --> 00:00:03,366
AND TOOLS OF SOCIAL CONTROL.

2
00:00:03,367 --> 00:00:05,901
THEY BECOME ILLEGITIMATE AND

3
00:00:05,902 --> 00:00:06,669
SCARY END OF THIS CASE OUGHT TO

4
00:00:06,670 --> 00:00:09,705
MAKE YOU NERVOUS.

5
00:00:09,706 --> 00:00:11,707
JOHN BRENNAN RAN THE CIA UNDER

6
00:00:15,612 --> 00:00:16,846
MSNBC WHO INSULTS DONALD TRUMP

7
00:00:16,847 --> 00:00:18,280
AND ADVOCATES FOR THE DEMOCRATIC

8
00:00:18,281 --> 00:00:19,115
PARTY.

9
00:00:19,116 --> 00:00:20,616
HE NO LONGER WORKS FOR THE

10
00:00:20,617 --> 00:00:21,851
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IN ANY

11
00:00:21,852 --> 00:00:24,286
CAPACITY, HE HOLDS NO OFFICIAL

12
00:00:24,287 --> 00:00:26,355
POST AND YET ACCORDING TO TWO

13
00:00:26,356 --> 00:00:28,324
SOURCES WE SPOKE TO EXCLUSIVELY

14
00:00:28,325 --> 00:00:29,925
TODAY, HE RETAINS PERHAPS THE

15
00:00:29,926 --> 00:00:31,994
MOST VALUABLE ASSET HE HAD IN

16
00:00:31,995 --> 00:00:33,295
GOVERNMENT -- A TOP-SECRET

17
00:00:33,296 --> 00:00:35,331
SECURITY CLEARANCE.

18
00:00:35,332 --> 00:00:36,932
THIS ALLOWS HIM TO DO WITH THE

19
00:00:36,933 --> 00:00:38,667
REST OF US CANNOT DO, VIA A

20
00:00:38,668 --> 00:00:44,106
GOVERNMENT DOCUMENTS AND DISCUSS

21
00:00:44,107 --> 00:00:45,274
WITH INTELLIGENCE OFFICIALS ARE

22
00:00:45,275 --> 00:00:46,175
STILL WORKING IN GOVERNMENT AND

23
00:00:46,176 --> 00:00:47,343
LICK THAT INFORMATION TO THE

24
00:00:47,344 --> 00:00:48,310
PRESS.

25
00:00:48,311 --> 00:00:51,113
THIS IS AN AWESOME POWER, OUR

26
00:00:51,114 --> 00:00:52,114
INTELLIGENCE AGENCIES KEEP

27
00:00:52,115 --> 00:00:53,549
AMERICA'S MOST SENSITIVE

28
00:00:53,550 --> 00:00:54,717
SECRETS.

29
00:00:54,718 --> 00:00:55,918
THEY HOLD HIGHLY PERSONAL

30
00:00:57,954 --> 00:00:59,355
IT IS TERRIFYING TO THINK HE

31
00:00:59,356 --> 00:01:01,323
STILL HAS ACCESS TO ANY

32
00:01:01,324 --> 00:01:01,724
INFORMATION.

33
00:01:01,725 --> 00:01:03,726
HE IS AN OUT OF THE CLOSET

34
00:01:03,727 --> 00:01:04,727
EXTREMIST.

35
00:01:04,727 --> 00:01:06,729
THIS WEEK, HE ACCUSED

36
00:01:06,730 --> 00:01:08,898
DONALD TRUMP OF TREASON, A DEATH

37
00:01:08,899 --> 00:01:09,365
PENALTY OFFENSE.

38
00:01:09,366 --> 00:01:11,367
HE SUGGESTED IT WOULD BE

39
00:01:11,368 --> 00:01:12,935
REASONABLE FOR THE INTELLIGENCE

40
00:01:12,936 --> 00:01:14,103
AGENCIES TO CONCEAL INFORMATION

41
00:01:14,104 --> 00:01:14,970
FROM THE PRESIDENT -- THAT'S A

42
00:01:14,971 --> 00:01:16,138
VIOLATION OF THEIR CHARTER AND A

43
00:01:16,139 --> 00:01:19,175
VIOLATION OF FEDERAL LAW.

44
00:01:23,180 --> 00:01:24,313
TWEETS DIRECTLY TO THE PRESIDENT

45
00:01:24,314 --> 00:01:25,414
LIKE A CRAZY PERSON.

46
00:01:25,415 --> 00:01:42,498
EARLIER THIS YEAR HE WROTE THIS.

47
00:01:42,499 --> 00:01:43,332
YOU COULD ALMOST HEAR HIS

48
00:01:43,333 --> 00:01:45,468
FINGERS SMASHING THE KEYBOARD,

49
00:01:45,469 --> 00:01:46,902
NOT A STABLE MAN.

50
00:01:46,903 --> 00:01:48,270
HE IS A PASSIONATE IDEOLOGUE

51
00:01:48,271 --> 00:01:51,106
WITH A DOCUMENTED HISTORY OF

52
00:01:51,107 --> 00:01:51,507
DISHONESTY.

53
00:01:51,508 --> 00:01:55,110
THE CIA DIRECTOR HE LIED ABOUT

54
00:01:55,111 --> 00:01:56,879
SPYING ON SENATE STAFFERS AND

55
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:57,947
KILLING CIVILIANS WITH DRONE

56
00:01:57,948 --> 00:01:58,714
STRIKES.

57
00:01:58,715 --> 00:02:01,550
HE LIED ABOUT THE STEELE DOSSIER

58
00:02:01,551 --> 00:02:03,919
FAMOUSLY.

59
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:04,920
HE PREVENTED THE CIA FROM

60
00:02:04,921 --> 00:02:10,392
REFERRING TO ISLAMIC MILITANTS

61
00:02:10,393 --> 00:02:11,293
AS JIHADISTS.

62
00:02:11,294 --> 00:02:13,762
IF THIS IS NOT A MAN WHO SHOULD

63
00:02:13,763 --> 00:02:15,164
HAVE SECURITY CLEARANCE.

64
00:02:15,165 --> 00:02:19,735
WE CALLED TO ASK IF HE HAS

65
00:02:19,736 --> 00:02:20,469
REVEALED CLASSIFIED INFORMATION

66
00:02:20,470 --> 00:02:21,570
OR IF HE'S PAST INFORMATION TO

67
00:02:21,571 --> 00:02:22,571
HIS COLLEAGUES ON NBC, THEY DID

68
00:02:22,572 --> 00:02:26,275
NOT RESPOND.

69
00:02:29,279 --> 00:02:31,146
DISHONESTY WHO RETAINS A

70
00:02:31,147 --> 00:02:31,847
GOVERNMENT SECURITY CLEARANCE.

71
00:02:31,848 --> 00:02:34,149
IF JIM KLAPPER APPEARS TO HAVE

72
00:02:34,150 --> 00:02:35,751
12, THE SAME WITH MICHAEL HAYDEN

73
00:02:35,752 --> 00:02:37,686
A FORMER CIA DIRECTOR.

74
00:02:37,687 --> 00:02:38,754
HE RECENTLY SUGGESTED THE

75
00:02:38,755 --> 00:02:39,955
PRESIDENT IS CARRYING OUT A

76
00:02:44,594 --> 00:02:45,327
CLASSIFIED INFORMATION WINDS UP

77
00:02:45,328 --> 00:02:48,531
IN THE MEDIA ON A DAILY BASIS,

78
00:02:48,532 --> 00:02:49,698
"THE NEW YORK TIMES" STORY THIS

79
00:02:52,502 --> 00:02:53,302
AND BOLSTER THE DEMOCRATIC

80
00:02:53,303 --> 00:02:54,937
PARTY, NOW YOU HAVE SOME SENSE.

81
00:02:54,938 --> 00:02:56,105
YOU WOULD HATE TO THINK THAT

82
00:02:56,106 --> 00:02:58,374
DEEP STATE IS REAL, THERE IS A

83
00:02:58,375 --> 00:02:59,208
PERMANENT GOVERNMENT THAT

84
00:02:59,209 --> 00:03:00,276
OPERATES INDEPENDENTLY OF VOTERS

85
00:03:08,685 --> 00:03:09,552
SENATOR RAND PAUL REPRESENTS THE

86
00:03:09,553 --> 00:03:10,553
COMMONWEALTH OF KENTUCKY, HE IS

87
00:03:10,554 --> 00:03:12,154
WORRIED ABOUT THIS.

88
00:03:12,155 --> 00:03:12,821
WE TALKED TO HIM ABOUT IT A

89
00:03:12,822 --> 00:03:16,692
SHORT TIME AGO.

90
00:03:16,693 --> 00:03:18,694
JOHN BRENNAN IS AN IRRESPONSIBLE

91
00:03:18,695 --> 00:03:19,428
PARTISAN COMBATANT WHO WORKS FOR

92
00:03:19,429 --> 00:03:21,764
A CABLE NEWS CHANNEL AND HAS

93
00:03:21,765 --> 00:03:23,299
THREATENED THE PRESIDENT ON

94
00:03:23,300 --> 00:03:23,699
TWITTER.

95
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:25,334
WHY IN THE WORLD WOULD HE HAVE A

96
00:03:25,335 --> 00:03:27,303
TOP-SECRET FEDERAL SECURITY

97
00:03:27,304 --> 00:03:27,870
CLEARANCE?

98
00:03:27,871 --> 00:03:30,139
>> THIS IS ALARMING.

99
00:03:33,343 --> 00:03:34,310
DONALD TRUMP?

100
00:03:34,311 --> 00:03:35,945
AND HE RESEARCHES FAMILY, KENNY

101
00:03:35,946 --> 00:03:37,379
TYPE MY NAME INTO COMPUTER

102
00:03:37,380 --> 00:03:38,147
SEARCH ENGINES, CAN HE LOOK AT

103
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:53,529
PRESIDENTS -- IT'S ALARMING.

104
00:03:53,530 --> 00:03:54,296
IF HE HAS SECURITY CLEARANCE

105
00:03:54,297 --> 00:03:56,699
IT'S ALARMING.

106
00:03:56,700 --> 00:03:58,300
>> Tucker: WE SPOKE TO

107
00:04:01,137 --> 00:04:02,438
WE TRY TO CONFIRM IT WITH THE

108
00:04:06,476 --> 00:04:07,276
COMMENT ON THAT, WE BELIEVE IT

109
00:04:07,277 --> 00:04:11,547
TO BE TRUE.

110
00:04:11,548 --> 00:04:13,749
WHAT WOULD PREVENT HIM FROM

111
00:04:13,750 --> 00:04:14,917
SPEAKING TO CURRENT EMPLOYEES OF

112
00:04:14,918 --> 00:04:16,919
THE CIA OR OTHER INTELLIGENCE

113
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:17,953
AGENCIES AND GETTING SECRET

114
00:04:17,954 --> 00:04:19,154
INFORMATION FROM THEM THAT COULD

115
00:04:19,154 --> 00:04:20,755
BE LEAKED TO THE PRESS ARE USED

116
00:04:20,757 --> 00:04:23,292
AGAINST HIS POLITICAL OPPONENTS?

117
00:04:23,293 --> 00:04:26,295
>> HE HAS A HISTORY OF LEAKING

118
00:04:26,296 --> 00:04:27,596
INFORMATION ALREADY, NOT ONLY

119
00:04:27,597 --> 00:04:29,298
FOR POLITICAL REASONS BUT A FEW

120
00:04:32,435 --> 00:04:34,303
THAT PERSON WAS STILL ON THE

121
00:04:38,341 --> 00:04:39,575
BACKPEDALED AND THEY HAD TO

122
00:04:39,576 --> 00:04:40,309
RESCUE SOMEONE OUT OF YEMEN WHO

123
00:04:51,221 --> 00:04:53,522
PROBLEM WITH LEAKING, WHO IN THE

124
00:04:53,523 --> 00:04:54,890
RIGHT MIND WOULD WANT TO LET HIM

125
00:04:54,891 --> 00:04:57,426
HAVE THE POWER STILL TO SEARCH

126
00:04:57,427 --> 00:04:59,862
THROUGH EVERYBODY'S RECORDS?

127
00:04:59,863 --> 00:05:01,630
>> Tucker: HE'S A PRIVATE

128
00:05:01,631 --> 00:05:02,331
CITIZEN WHO WORKS FOR A CABLE

129
00:05:04,100 --> 00:05:05,501
CLEARANCE AND FIND OUT

130
00:05:05,502 --> 00:05:06,235
GOVERNMENT SECRETS AND USE THEM

131
00:05:06,236 --> 00:05:08,170
IN THE COURSE OF MY JOB?

132
00:05:08,171 --> 00:05:09,972
>> I THINK IT'S COMPLETELY CRAZY

133
00:05:09,973 --> 00:05:11,273
AND THE IDEA THAT HE COULD BE

134
00:05:19,649 --> 00:05:21,283
NOT ONLY TO THE PRESIDENT ASKING

135
00:05:21,284 --> 00:05:22,918
IF HE STILL HAS CLEARANCE WHICH

136
00:05:22,919 --> 00:05:24,720
I THINK THE PRESIDENT MIGHT BE

137
00:05:24,721 --> 00:05:25,421
INTERESTED IN THIS ISSUE.

138
00:05:25,422 --> 00:05:28,257
I'M SENDING IT TO JEFF SESSIONS

139
00:05:28,258 --> 00:05:30,192
AND DAN COATS, WE ARE GOING TO

140
00:05:30,193 --> 00:05:31,927
PRESS THE CASE AND WE ARE GOING

141
00:05:31,928 --> 00:05:33,629
TO FIND OUT DOES HE STILL HAVE

142
00:05:33,630 --> 00:05:36,498
CLEARANCE AND SHOULD A PERSON

143
00:05:36,499 --> 00:05:37,966
WHO HAS CALLED THE PRESIDENT

144
00:05:41,304 --> 00:05:42,871
>> Tucker: IT'S NOT JUST

145
00:05:42,872 --> 00:05:43,939
BRENNAN, IT IS POTENTIALLY END

146
00:05:43,940 --> 00:05:47,309
WE BELIEVE IT IS ALSO JAMES

147
00:05:50,747 --> 00:05:52,815
CURRENT PARTISAN WARFARE,

148
00:05:58,121 --> 00:05:58,353
STUDENTS THERE BE SOME MECHANISO

149
00:05:58,354 --> 00:05:59,254
PREVENT THEM FROM ENGAGING IN

150
00:05:59,255 --> 00:06:02,891
PARTISAN WARFARE?

151
00:06:02,892 --> 00:06:04,993
>> JUDGES GRANT WARRANTS SO THEY

152
00:06:04,994 --> 00:06:07,863
WOULD HAVE TO GO TO A JUDGE TO

153
00:06:07,864 --> 00:06:08,964
GET PERMISSION TO LOOK AT THE

154
00:06:08,965 --> 00:06:09,865
DATABASE.

155
00:06:09,866 --> 00:06:11,600
I DON'T WANT THEM RESEARCHING

156
00:06:11,601 --> 00:06:13,435
DONALD TRUMP'S POLITICAL

157
00:06:13,436 --> 00:06:16,472
SUPPORTERS, THE WAY TO STOP IT

158
00:06:16,473 --> 00:06:17,206
IS TO HAVE OVERALL REFORM AND

159
00:06:17,207 --> 00:06:17,873
I'M GOING TO TALK TO THE

160
00:06:17,874 --> 00:06:20,476
PRESIDENT ON MONDAY.

161
00:06:20,477 --> 00:06:21,710
WERE GOING TO ASK THE PRESIDENT

162
00:06:21,711 --> 00:06:23,679
WILL YOU INSTITUTE A NEW RULE AT

163
00:06:27,350 --> 00:00:00,000
FOR AMERICANS MATERIAL WITHOUT
