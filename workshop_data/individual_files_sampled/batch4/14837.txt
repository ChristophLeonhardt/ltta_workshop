i'm ezra levan it's May 3rd and you're watching battleground well how much fun is this we have been doing this all week every weekday at 12:00 noon til 1:00 p.m. Eastern Time we're having a live chit chat on the Google sua chat it's called on YouTube I I thought it was fun I just saw it the other day and it's it's a live chat and I interact with the comments on the side of the screen and super chat is a way for folks to pin their comment to the talk and it's a way for us to make a few bucks to pay the bills around here because unlike the CBC we take zero government funding and unlike corporate media we don't have a big backer where view were supported and it's a way for me to interrupts set my day perk up a bit and tackle some new stories that I don't cover in my 8 p.m. Eastern paywall show so we've got some fun stories today including the forever first lady Michelle Obama this was just calling yourself the forever first lady we have some exciting news from Reuters on polling stats I see that for the first time ever Donald Trump is at 50% in the daily tracking polls in marasmus and they do a daily tracking poll approval for Donald Trump he's at 50% and I don't think it's a coincidence that yesterday Reuters came out and said Donald Trump's support amongst black men has literally doubled from 11% to 22% since the whole Kanye West thing started if you're talking about 11% movement in one week that is enough to tip some battleground states is 11 percent in one demographic but the black vote is about I know 12 percent of the u.s. population that's enough to make the difference in tight races I know I'm a little bit late to the Utah teenager who wore the Asian dress to prom and started the whole cultural appropriation spat but what's new in that story is how she's not bending the knee to political correctness and we've got we've read some other fun images to go along with it and then finally I'm gonna talk a little bit about North Korea freeing all remaining Ameri in captives before the negotiation even starts I mean I haven't negotiated a lot of heavy things in my life but I know that if you're making concessions before the negotiation even starts if you're giving things up before you've even bargained that's a pretty good success for Donald Trump but I'll show you how at least one a net which is covering up and of course I am going to engage with that chat this is our fourth time trying this we're learning out the wrinkles a little bit I'm remembering what it's like to be live and unscripted as opposed to my 8:00 p.m. show which I write out and it's sort of in a format and we decided that tomorrow and hopefully if we keep doing this every Friday we will have sort of free-for-all Fridays where all I will do is look at that rolling list I got my laptop right here those rolling comments and as I said briefly yesterday we try and take out the really obscene ones or the gratuitous swearing but I'm you know we're we believe in free speech here even critical speech and in fact if there's some issues that bug people about the rebel there's some critics there's some critics of the realm I know it's hard to believe it's hard to believe anyone could possibly criticize the rebel for our point of view um I'd like to engage those because the there I may actually have an answer on things and I mean I don't waste time on my critics but I don't ignore them completely either I sometimes the criticisms are funny and sometimes there's a little grain of truth under them so tomorrow we're just going to dig in the super chat function is you pay a couple of bucks and your comment is highlighted in a fluorescent color like a highlighter pen and it's affixed there for a period of time commensurate with how much it chipped in so yesterday someone someone paid $50 and their comment was up there for for most of the segments so that's the super chat the one innovation we did yesterday's we're going to spread out my stories a bit so I've got I don't know one two three four stories say I'm not going to do them all at once why don't we start with the supermodel who was the first lady until January of 2017 supermodel in our own mind but not just in our own mind on the cover of every woman's fashion mag in America Michelle Obama grace their covers time and again like a supermodel would do I have no criticism to comments on whether or not she has supermodel looks I'm just saying that she meets the actual definition of a supermodel she is in high fashion photography shoots all the time on the cover of high fashion magazines isn't that the definition of a supermodel regardless of her looks and by that same definition Melania Trump is not a supermodel because can you name a single magazine cover that she has graced can you name a single designer who says oh I want Melania to wear my clothing so if you use the mainstream media as your arbiter indeed Michelle Obama is well let me give you her phrase for what she is roll the clip everything to succeed I know that you are me and if I can be standing here as your forever first lady then you can do anything you put your mind to forever first lady I don't think that's a thing I don't think easy to say you're a forever first lady I mean yeah I mean forever you will have been a first lady but the whole point about first lady and presidents and if one day there is a first husband and thank God it won't be book Linton it's not based on the person it's based on the office and the office is based on the American Constitution and the reason why Michelle Obama was the first lady is not because she's particularly awesome or a supermodel it's because her husband won the Democratic mandate from Americans and it was by grace of that office in that Constitution that she was the temporary custodian of that title first lady there is no forever first lady in America there is no forever president and I don't think I don't think that was a heavy statement by her I mean she was just saying if I can do anything you can do anything and that's actually a great uplifting message but you know I actually think there was sort of an entitlement mentality there as you surely know Obama didn't just have his family his immediate family in the White House his mother a lot they all moved in sort of like Justin Trudeau in a way that same sort of entitlement mentality put the two nannies on the payroll bring the whole family and I mean on their Gala trips to Washington DC when Obama was president Trudeau not only brought his whole family brought his in-laws to the gala state dinner in Washington didn't bring the energy minister he brought his party apparatus and his fundraisers and his family that same sort of entitlement Arastoo Craddock dripping we see in Obama and the Trudeau's I think they really do think that they are a special class of human being not just people who temporarily held a particular office all right I'm gonna take a quick look at prim Paulo it says both the Obamas saw themselves as celebrities it's called narcissism well I asked with my analogy about Michelle Obama meeting the dictionary definition of a supermodel they were celebrities now first of all any president is to be a celebrity in our age we are the most affordable graft person in the country really Donald Trump was an enormous celebrity before he became president and he is using that celebrity even more than Obama I think the difference is that Trump was a celebrity before he took office he was friends with all the cool people either because he was interesting you must admit he's an interesting man or did cool things you must admit he did or he was a billionaire and people thought well maybe I can get a paycheck from him maybe I can get a gig on his shows I mean he was maybe I can get conked some Hotel nights at his casino or something so everyone loved to hang out with Donald Trump he was a media celebrity he was on Oprah all the time um until he became a Republican and until he became president then he was D celebrity' fide at least by the fancy people Obama was the opposite Obama was extremely low-profile before he got into politics in fact there's very few records of his life before politics there really are a lot of people in college who even recall him and he only became a celebrity by virtue of being a left-wing president and I mean I suppose that's fine but there's no forever first ladies I'm going to take one more comment and then I'm gonna go to the next story didn't Obama too clear that he held the office of president-elect I don't think so I mean he might have he might have said that during the period he was president-elect unless I'm missing something rappers love Trump Kanye was correct well that's true and because Trump symbolized the kind of braggadocio that is essential to rap and the ostentatious earning and spending of money that is also part of the rap culture there's and I think that is probably more legitimately a part of rap and rap culture than voting democrat I can't think of a less cool person by rap terms then grandma Hillary Clinton I mean she's just the least hip-hop human being I mean if she was I mean she's just pretty square do you think um I'm gonna there's a lot of comments coming on there but I am gonna move on to the next subject cause it's already 12:10 and I'm just getting warmed up you know how it is I was I was talking about some polls and let's go to the Reuters poll on April 22nd I don't if you make that out there this is an answer to the question hold this up on the screen for a bit overall do you approve or disapprove about the way Donald Trump is handling his job as president so that's sort of the boilerplate approve or disapprove question and as you can see I don't if you can see the bottom there those little blue tabs it's black mail so you can you can you can get into the details so Trump said about 50% general approval you can break that down by gender you can break that down by race which I think is very interesting so 10 days ago Trump was at 87 percent disapproval and 11 percent approval and that that's no surprise african-americans are overwhelmingly Democrat more than any other demographic more than Hispanics more than Jews more than Catholics in general so that was April 22 and then put up the next one here we have April 29 look at that disapprove has plunged to 71 approve has doubled to 22 and what's that other one they're a bit of both or mixed feelings or whatever 7.1 percent so those are people who are thinking about it so in the course of 7 days from April 22 to April 29 the number of black men who say yeah I like what Trump is doing has gobbled and if those pregnant yellow bar people make the move over imagine if that would be 29.1% am i right imagine if 30% of black men said yeah I'm for Trump and I think this is the result of two things I think first of all it's the obvious result of Trump engaging with one of America's most prominent black men Kanye West I mean I've got my issues with Kanye West I mean as I do with most celebrities of any color or background but there's an engagement there it's not just Kanye West musing about Trump it's Trump showing Kanye West some respect retweeting him saying that's cool they've obviously met before we've all seen the footage of the meeting at Trump Tower that was over a year ago who knows what conversations they've had in private since then others in the Trump family including Don Trump jr. interacting via Twitter so I think the very fact that Donald Trump is giving time and attention and interest and respect to a leading black celebrity businessman artist a pop philosopher I think black managed to say hey I approve of that I mean I don't think that's necessarily saying I'm a Republican if you look at the question that there was in the poets do you prove the way he's handling the job so you don't even have to be a Republican to say yeah I approve I like what's going on I like what's going on like this banter I like this honest conversation I like this Candace Owens the young black girl we have interviewed before who was really the breakthrough when Kanye West said I like how count Candace Owen thinks and then the dam broke um so that's the first thing and the second thing is what Kanye West himself does have a following and and much of that following as surely as shallow as any other celebrity has Katy Perry Taylor Swift whatever but Kanye does style himself a thinker in some ways if you follow his Twitter feed some of it is just sort of Hallmark card style cliches or you know Tony Robbins style you can do it but but he does try and and wrestle with issues and you can see in his Twitter feed that he occasionally follows conservative philosophers from Thomas Sowell the great black conservative to jordan Peterson I see out of the corner of my eye the bright pastel colors or of a super chill image taken glance the corker answer have you heard that Obama made side deals to the Iran nuclear deal these deals were not made public to Congress or the US people yes yes in in fact I recall covering that I think I was at the Sun News Network at the time the idea that there were deals not even shown to the rest of the Senate was something I'll come back to that a little bit later but I mean I mean just close my point about Kanye West he is talking about what it means to be a conservative he's he tweeted the other day I don't know if I'm a conservative I don't call myself one and people ought not to yet call me one but the very fact that he is making it acceptable to brainstorm to think and we showed the clips yesterday of his visit to TMZ I think Americans and and the whole world enjoys learning along with someone who has a little drop of humility as they go when Glenn Beck was at his finest in my view it was when he was learning a subject for the first time you his enthusiasm and natural curiosity was infectious and you learned along with him and because he was so conscious and and honest about the fact that he was just a student any mistakes he made along the way you could forgive him because you were you could see that he was learning in real time I think that's it what Kanye is doing as well I don't know if he's a conservative certainly there's skeptics even on the right I see Tommy Lauren and ben shapiro or skeptical of connelly the US and maybe they'll be proven right but I don't think Kanye's holding himself out to be a great political philosopher I think he's learning in real time as we're all watching and that's what makes it so fascinating and I think that's what makes it so authentic and I think that is a reason why the number of black men who think Donald Trump's doing a good job has doubled and let me tell you if you have studied the 2016 exit poll results as closely as I have it I'm sure a lot of you have you can find them very easily online I recommend you do that you know already that Donald Trump got a more of the black vote and Hispanic vote then Mitt Romney did in 2012 so all the condemnation no Trump you're a racist Oh Trump you well official everyone knows he's not a racist that's baloney but Trump already did much better than Republicans in the past did in terms of reaching out to minorities and you know the Trump won so many of those breakthrough states by one or two points I mean the state of Pennsylvania which for a generation has been Democrat I don't know the stat offhand but I think it was within 1% I think the total the total vote count that took Pennsylvania from Democrat to Republican I think it was like only 50,000 or 60,000 votes there's a large african-american population in Pennsylvania I mean Philadelphia is almost half black and if you had the number of black men in Philadelphia I'm just picking one city double their support for Donald Trump what's that in a city like Philly is that gonna be 20,000 more votes well I just told you the state tipped Republican by 60,000 so you take 20,000 away from the Dems you put 20,000 on the Republicans you just locked in Pennsylvania I see how the corner of my eye a question from j-money c18 I would love to work for the rebel are you guys hiring no thank you the $5 you chipped in will assist us in covering our payroll I think we have an email called careers at the rebel media and you can send an email in there with more specifics about what kind of stuff you do a lot of people like the rebel and I'm grateful that you do we have certain things that we need we sometimes we need technical things we need a video editor or other technical positions that you might not think about when you're looking at the company from the outside we're always looking for talent on the content side but we have to be able to pay for it and that's obviously really really tough but if you are interested send us a note to career said the media okay well it's 12:20 I think we're right on track right we're keeping on track but yeah Khan you're very interesting now this dressed thing can we put up the prom dress pics I'm sure you've seen this a lovely young lady I don't even know how to say her name I think it's cuz a year because I she's a teenager she's in high school and and she put this on her Twitter and her Instagram that's her prom dress and her prom date and they look great but what a great young couple and they're doing a namaste so they just mixing it up they got a Chinese dress and they're doing the Indian llamaste and some guys are doing some wrap signals or is that a baseball signal and they got a bit of everything going on there but you know what they are teenagers they're teenagers having the time of their life at their problem kids it's all downhill from there but having some fun and that very pretty gal put on that very pretty dress and tweeted a picture because we are in the selfie culture and Twitter itself by which I mean the social media company itself shamed her because some loser some unknown anonymous nobody who claims to be Asian said that's not a dress for your appropriation my culture is not your goddamn progress and I think it was said with a shout well because the nod is in all caps so you know he really really means it Jeremy Lamb I leave that 177 thousand likes and um the reason that got so many likes is not natural I've been a Jeremy lambs little Twitter feed he's a nobody nothing with a few hundred followers if I recall it's because Twitter the social media company itself boosted that made that an official Twitter moment shamed her as a as part of it yeah I don't know if you know this but Twitter they sort of select what they think are interesting moments of the day and they thought targeting hatred against a teenage twitter user hang on isn't that against their Terms of Service well not if you're shaming a girl for wearing Chinese dress apparently what's amazing about this is that this I think she's 18 this 18 year old gal who is not political she's not a key at age is on a journalist she showed more courage and push back against the online media mob then 95 percent of celebrities and politicians I mean Shania Twain immediately caved in when she said I like Donald Trump came immediately some of the rappers who originally came out for Kanye West came to immediately journalists and politicians in Canada I mean I mean I think of Anders here cave immediately this 18 year old girl had over a hundred thousand people crapping on her act and the mob being ripped up by Twitter itself and she didn't blink with me let me show you a little clip from Fox and Friends take a look I feel that there there's a difference between wearing something with a different intent because III personally I wore the dress because I really respect the culture and I believe it is very beautiful and I wanted to show my respect and love by wearing one of their clothes in admiration of them if you could do it all over again would you wear the same dress yes I would definitely wear it again good for her good for her and by the way that critic of hers mr. lamb I don't know where mr. lambs family's from but I'm since he says his culture is Asian and I presume it's from China or something isn't he culturally appropriating the English language isn't that part of the indigenous British culture I mean how come he gets to culturally appropriate English and he probably signs his checks 2018 so he's culturally appropriating the Christian date as many dates as a Jewish calendar there's a Chinese calendar there's we know that from Chinese to here there's there's various different ways to signify time perhaps mr. lamb is now a Christian if so he appropriated that too didn't he because the Chinese calendar is not 2000 18 and yet that was marked on his Twitter tweet my point is we all appropriate things all the time from fashion to language to to sign I mean isn't that called learning isn't that called learning and things are mixed and matched and traded what an absurdity and I'm just so proud of that young girl for not bending the knee I am curious though while why Twitter finds it fine to whip up a mob against a young gal I think the real answer is she was obviously very pretty and they were just trying to get some clicks I think of the gal herself had not been so pretty they wouldn't have cared I think they just loved whipping up hatred against a pretty girl but speaking of customer appropriation hey could I remind you of something that was done in the name of all people kind take a look at this picture I think we got it yeah there we go so why was this fine and by the way those weren't even bought in this weren't even Indian designers those were made in Canada just like Justin Trudeau brought his own Indian chef from Canada to India because I guess the Indians don't know how to make Indian food well of all she's even got the bindi spot going on there oh I think he does - I think he does - yeah see you have to understand when Justin Trudeau does that it's because he's being open-minded progressive and multicultural when an 18 year old girl wears a pretty dress it's because she's racist that's the way it is all right I'm gonna look at a look at the comments for a minute it's 1225 I got to keep eye on the clock because I got to tell you if I don't this would be a two-hour thing every day and I wouldn't get any other work done David Lincoln hello I see you're super chat and that's very nice of you but I do not see an attendant comment I'm going to read a couple more comments before I move on to Donald Trump a very very important news about Donald Trump that I've learned from the Washington Post then I absolutely have to bring to your attention I'm going to okay I'm reading some some comments here amen 123 Israel is the root of all evil in this world Israel did 9/11 that's just sort of stupid I think I'm not kind of sensor that I they just think it's stupid that is Jeremy Lamb and other social justice warrior misery loves company yeah I mean I don't he was I don't even know that he was looking for something to get upset about if that is the most upsetting thing to you as an asian-american if that is the most irritating oppressive thing in your life you're living the dream buddy I mean if that's all you got to complain about that a pretty girl likes your culture so much she wants to dress up in your cultures clothing you have nothing to complain about and of course these people love to complain I'm just reading some more oh I sorry I do see David's comment right now how many of those angry with because the CAHSEE a keziah are in favor of women wearing hijabs well that is a very good question David because of course that's not just culture appropriation that's respect um if it's coming from a Muslim putting on a headscarf or even better a face obliterating the cap is respect but if it was let's say a Catholic priest and a nun's habit well that would just be the patriarchy and don't you understand um I'm gonna read a couple more comments Ezra this is from J Ezra you've done good work to keep the online conservative movement on his toes you've at least got a footnote in history thank you very much footnote in history check that off the bucket list I'm gonna scroll NJ Grant says Justin Trudeau cringe channel you should work with Ezra okay don't know that means so what says it was totally dumb and gay like all this brother crap okay I don't know what you mean dream Crashers he says from Philly it's over 50% black yeah that's my point it said if Donald Trump has a breakthrough with a young black man you're gonna see cities like Philly and again I don't think he's ever gonna win Philly itself but of course in the state system they have an electoral college so you its votes counted in the whole state and in us in a state and Wisconsin too by the way where you have Milwaukee fairly black city and the rest of Wisconsin which is less black it tipped to the words for the Republicans under Trump because of the places outside Milwaukee but you Paul fifty thousand more votes out of Milwaukee and yeah Trump Trump's Gotha if I was a Democrat I would be panicked which is why the Democrats are panicked which is why you see the Democrats on late-night TV just scorching just scorching Kanye West parking lot Batman says is Suzanne here I want to talk about Jews what's with all the Jews talk I mean I'm Jewish it's I don't think it animates most of what we talk about here at the rebel I'm trying to think of our on-air contributors and I don't even think we have another Jewish on-air contributor I might be missing someone yeah we're pro-israel we're also Pro Taiwan and I'm not talkin ease we are pro America and a non American we're pro Christian and I'm not Christian in fact if you don't know yet we made a movie about the persecution of Christians in Iraq called save the Christians calm so i yeah i'm not gonna censor those comments but i think they're sort of stupid all right i want to move to the last news story and it's 1229 so we'll take about five minutes here and then we'll finish up we're going to the comments it's been an amazing week in america i mean unemployment obviously the lowest ever the trade in the exports are up very high apple is meeting with the president talking about repatriating a quarter of a trillion dollars they're gonna pay that out to shareholders share buybacks i mean just amazing amazing news everywhere but perhaps the most striking news was in north korea we're in a confidential and secret mission Mike Pompeo went to actually meet with Kim jong-un and what do you know normally meetings with Kim jong-un are give-and-take the West gives and he takes this so far it's the opposite and I'm struck by the fact that Kim jong-un crossed the border pen moon drum into the South and was met by the president in South Korea yes that's symbolic but that's all it is symbolic yes they signed a statement of denuclearization okay that's nice but that's worth precisely nothing until it happens and what's interesting to me is the moment of truth on that it's not five ten years in the future it's scheduled for next month but to me the most tangible proof that this meeting with North Korea is real is that North Korea has before the meeting with Trump before Trump fly said that meeting agreed to release all American captives something that Barack Obama tried in vain to do and I'm not just blaming Obama you think george w bush was any better you think bill clinton was any better clinton it's worse clinton gave north korea everything they wanted sent madeline albright to normalize the regime got nothing in return so the fact that North Korea is making tangible real provable yes no testing concessions before the meeting even starts is incredible now Donald Trump has formally been nominated by a group of people to be a recipient of the Nobel Peace Prize I say again that Nobel Peace Prize is not worth much it's the it's decide I mean their Nobel Prize in Chemistry is decided by experts in chemistry the Nobel Prize in Economics is decided by PhDs in economics the Nobel Prize for Peace is decided by a small committee of members of parliament of the Norwegian Parliament that would be like five MPs in Canada from the ruling party liberals or five Democrats in the US Congress getting together over beers and saying well who do we like it's completely political there are no objective standards as there are in chemistry or physics and that's why it's so left-wing that's why they gave it to Barack Obama literally the moment after he was sworn in as president that's why they give it to left-wing people just to spite America so I do not believe Donald Trump will get the Nobel Peace Prize I do not believe they know about Peace Prize is worth much I do believe what Donald Trump seems to be doing is quite important and that is all a preamble for telling you what America's leading Washington oriented politics oriented newspaper thinks it's most important I'm talking about the besos Washington Post the Amazon Washington Post and let me just show you this literally as America is getting a gap is read let me read this let me read this yeah president Trump either weighs 239 pounds or he doesn't have to be this was my dramatic voice okay let me try again I'm gonna read it like it's a movie trailer president Trump either weighs 239 pounds or he doesn't the latest Trump World controversy this time a medical mystery shout shrouded in secrecy Lenny M Bernstein and I report this is his story too big for any one of us hey let me read just the bottom part there I mean there's a picture of that Trump doctor he's got the best staff I had a view saw the picture of his old lawyer Ty Cobb and his doctor here these guys are great I'm political stress test Trump's medical history becomes another divisive something-something his former longtime doctor says Trump dictated a glowing letter attesting to his astonish the excellent health during the 2016 campaign guys I think we finally got it guys I think we finally finally finally found a way to stop Trump first we said the vote was rigged then we said the vote was hacked that didn't really make any sense as in terms of English words and language but we said anyways then we asked for a recount then we had riots then we said Russia Russia Russia then we had this collusion thing and we had guys hey guys guys you're still listening guys I think we found it guys I think and and there's two of us reporters on this to Donald Trump weighs more than 239 paths he said he was 239 pounds we got his doctor to say he was 242 pounds guys that is the that is the big story in The Washington Post with not one but two investigative reporters on it the day that Donald Trump brings brings the captives home from North Korea the Washington Post has more important things to tell you that's why I use the phrase the media party because if that were the talking point of the day from the Democrats we'd all say you're lame but that's the talking point of the media party and so who's watching the Watchmen who's reporting on the reporters when the Washington Post says that sentence of the day you have to take that into the news of the day because they are the news media I said go to some of your thoughts on this huge breaking breaking breaking breaking hold the front page Donald Trump is now 244 pounds he just had a really big sandwich stick some fat cakes 242 lies yeah you got your comments we got the hashtag lies tough 20/20 yeah that's his weight mister in decigrams or something Trump 242 yeah impeach 242 fat gate I'm just glad no one did a story with two investigative reporters on Michelle Obama's wait because that first lady forever would have crushed them I give her this she's got pipes you ever see Michelle Obama's arms the girl you don't want to write about her I'm just just comparing just comparing the media treatment of the weight of Republicans versus Democrats and what's news ELISA and the black box says Ashley Parker is confirming her life's work by pushing this story yep I think you're right high tech red says if they offer the Nobel Peace Prize to mr. Trump I bet he would turn it down because he knows what it's really stands for he might he might and he might go to some other event that sort of proves a point on that exact same day just like he had a rally with blue-collar workers in Michigan the night of the White House Correspondents Dinner and he loves those contrasts I don't think Donald Trump would be the type to fly to Norway and because that if Donald Trump were to value the nobel prize from Trump's point of view that would mean that Trump thought it was above him and it would raise him up whereas I'm sure that Donald Trump looks down on the committee of leftist MPs in the Norwegian Parliament and the idea that Donald Trump would fly for that honor which really is giving them an honor that he would accept it rather than meet with an ally rather than travel somewhere that's in his own interest I think you're right I do not think that Donald Trump would accept it because I don't even think he would trust what they would read or say or do and I don't think Donald Trump would put himself in that position um let me read some more imagine the media going on about Hillary's weight oh good one good see that's the thing is Donald Trump unhealthy if he's 240 pounds of said 239 pounds well speaking as one guy in that zone to another yeah yeah he could probably lose 20 pounds absolutely yeah you're so right but who was it hey guys can we call up the clip of Hillary Clinton stumbling to get in that van can you find that while we're going here is Donald Trump unhealthy because he's 230 242 pounds said 209 yeah sure yeah sure absolutely yes yeah you bet is he so unhealthy that he literally falls over and has to be grabbed and thrown into a van while secrets try and block the shot or I don't know if you saw the picture of her in India the other day when she was coming down the steps and had to be held once on each arm and she slipped twice and yeah I mean I get it steps can be slippery but she was being carried down almost like we can to Bernie's and so many of Hillary's health problems were called a conspiracy theory I mean Paul Joseph Watson oh hey I just hear we had the cliff thrown up in b-roll all talk over it look at that so we just grabbed this off I don't know where we grabbed this but look at Hillary Clinton she's leaning up against the pole you see it she's leaning up against the Ballard she's wobbling she's wobbling do you see that she has to be grabbed and thrown thrown and there's a Secret Service agent doing a good job blocking the shot I don't know whose words these are her campaigns she overheated but look at that okay look at the close-up and by the way they lifted her and threw her and one of her shoes fell off and they didn't retrieve her they were in such a hurry oh my god they're throwing her into the van it was from The Telegraph obviously um blackout on that story and the real truth behind it she lied to report she said she's got she had a cold she had a cold hey guys have you ever had a cold that made it so you had to be picked up and thrown into the back of a van I did a longer video on this in late 2016 it's available in on YouTube um you know WikiLeaks and and some of these other leaked documents and access to information requests by the way by Judicial Watch and others so there's a lot of internal documents but Hillary Clinton that you can find and some of them are searchable I went to a Hillary Clinton documents site i cant member which one right now and i typed in hillary sleep and nap and it's amazing her health she would sleep all the time she would have naps in the middle of the day Huma would send memos other stuff don't interrupt her now she needs her nap at like 3 p.m. I mean I get at 3 p.m. your sugars coming down that's when afternoon tea was invented for give you a little sugar in caffeine I don't want a Pepsi or something to perk up or or maybe get some fresh air do a little exercise whatever I don't know me we all get a little bit down in the afternoon when I'm digesting lunch she would have full out naps every day she had a full out bed on her plane I think normally the bed is just for the president Air Force One she and and the thing is at first her staff and you got to go back and find my video on this because I don't have the document front of me I won't be able to get a quick in real-time her staff would spin this I swear to god they called her a champion Napper and they were boasting about how great she is at having naps let me check the time 12:40 well we're okay you don't boast about how great you are at napping cuz that's like saying you're boasting you're boasting at not doing things can you stay up for 30 hours that I mean I during the Falklands crisis I know that Margaret Thatcher slept four hours a night she was so engaged with the crisis she was sending the Navy to war she had this desease there was diplomacy there was strategy there was military there was politics that she was sleeping four hours a night and she was trying to keep her wits up I mean that's a leader in the type of crisis imagine bragging about being a champion Napper and how many hours she would say I swear to God her staff were doing that and she requested from her chief of staff information about drugs even experimental style drugs to stay awake I don't know narcolepsy I don't know what the word is for that that gal is sick that I mean sick is in ill but it's a front-page story to reporters in the Washington Post because Trump's got a little bit of please a little fat hey guys I'm so fat all right I was gonna look for comics but let me just remind you what we're doing here every day every weekday between 12:00 noon Eastern and 1:00 p.m. I sit down here in front of them I want you think the fancy mic the first day wasn't plugged in so I told Pamela this is plugged in now this fancy and I just give her I have a few clips and I try and rebut this I mean there's hundreds of comments here there's just no way I'm gonna be able to read them all but if you want to make your comment stand out you can chip in two bucks or whatever and it's called super chat and it's pinned to the top there and I will do my best to read all the super chats because it's supporting us financially that's how we roll here at the rebel we don't get government money like the CBC or TV Oh or McLane's which gets 1.5 million dollars or the walrus which that's charitable status and has liberals on their boards we we don't we're not on the gravy train like that and unlike our friends at post media we're not begging for a bailout from Trudeau which is exactly why we are not in their pocket so we do the super chat and if you can't join us at this hour I know this is an hour when a lot of people are actually working so the can show in live that's fine you can watch it later it's permanently on YouTube obviously the chat functions are not working after the fact I seen in a super chat screw off says I love how Comey claimed she was very lawful wise well yes I mean we'll have to talk about James Comey I want more video clips or facts at my fingertips so I'm more precise when we talk about James Comey he's a little bit emo you know what I mean I mean reading his Twitter feed and looking at his comments reminds me of a very passionate idealistic hormonal teenager guy or girl I'm not sure which just emo and his autobiography maybe I can find it here quickly I'm not gonna try cuz I it would take me a minute to find it but those excerpts from his book where he talks about what a good man he and how Obama said you're a good man and he really really talked about his self praise and the praise of others and this is really weird how emotionally is I know that's got nothing to do with his approach to law making and law breaking but he is oh he's a big weird he's a bit weird and it is weird and his role during the election and I think he ought to have been fired and rod Rosenstein himself bit of an Obama I'd recommended he'd be fired and I think that was right I would not surprise me if James Comey was in fact prosecuted because he is admitted that he leaked FBI information that was against the law to do so and the rule of law should apply to the police even more strictly than to ordinary people because you are in a position of public trust in public power and those who enforce the law ought to be the most fault it would be like a cop speeding or a cop jaywalking even if it's not that indictable in the fence you're setting an example and when the head of the FBI leaks for political purposes that's a bad example I see on the corner of my eye another super chat tinkerer Diego with a Mexican support says longtime rebel supporter but occasionally hikes lots of Internet coverage over the use of Humboldt as a promo code I had to regretfully agree seemed rather tone-deaf comment thank you very much see this is what I mean this is a great question it's a critical question but it's a good question and I know exactly what you're talking about I did a monologue about a month ago about this disgraceful Marxist leftist named Laura Nora Loreto who when she saw the GoFundMe fundraising campaign for the Humboldt Broncos victims and their families it's very successful both for the family of the grieving dead and the grieving family of the dead and those who were in hospital Nora Loreto remarks all just a bunch of white males and I think she made a racist thing and I did a scorching rant on it and I emailed that out to all our people I said we're on the other side the CBC is romantic sighs ignore Lorraine oh all the meteors siding with her because they actually agree we're on the other side sign up to the rebel were the only people are going to tell you they're the side and I agree with every single word I wrote in that email but I'm I did when we have a coupon code we said we'll sign up and I just thought well what's the word that sums us up and I thought Nora and I thought no I'm not gonna use her dirty name as the coupon code well what word can we use for the coupon code Nora Loreto I thought Broncos because that was it was about and in retrospect I would have chosen a different word for the coupon code than Broncos but other than that every single word of my monologue and every single word in the email I stand by and if you look at them again I think you'll agree were spot on but yeah the coupon code which I sort of added later I was just like um I like to come up with a simple word that sums up the whole thing and Broncos was what came to mind but but I should have chosen like respect or media or some of them were like that but a great question um let me I can't Daniel grant I can't stand no Rhett oh oh my god or Nora don't get me started on her unhu' main creature well it's funny she loved that whole wrestling around him mucking around in the mud I saw a cbc panel for four people on the CBC all on her side what was super weird was the day of the van attack in North Toronto when Alec Minassian took a van and rammed ten people or kill ten people on the injured more Nora Loreto went back for a second helping I don't know if we can dig that up you guys quickly but Nora Loreto said oh traffic accidents are so banal or something like that like she just is such a ghoulish macabre snuff film like I where's the soul in that woman like as in her whole attack on the Saskatoon so the Humboldt Broncos was not an accident or if it was an accident she rechristened it as her greatest moment because he got her more attention than and it got her gigs by the way saw the national observer hired her to write so it's getting her paid and she actually went back for a second helping emeritus right there pedestrian injuries in Toronto so agonizingly mundane keep that up there just keep that up there this same Nora Loreto who mocked the race and sex of the humble Broncos by the way a woman was a victim there to who's part of the team not a player but part of the team and some of the players were Aboriginal as is often the case in the prairies were Aboriginal folks loved hockey as much as anyone so she's a gross racist huckster she came back for a second look at pedestrian injuries in Toronto so agonizingly mundane she literally tweeted this when that attack she has no soul she has no soul so yeah that's what we're talking about it's twelve fifty let's see if we can get in a couple more comments Trudeau cringe channel says wow that lady is sick in the head I hope she goes to hell well maybe she's Sharon he did maybe she's come back because there's a very devilish thing to say him by devilish I mean I don't mean that in like a cheeky Oh is she so devilishly clever no I mean as in diabolical that's what I mean parking lot Batman's had left us with a soul what yeah you can be a leftist with a soul you can be a liberal motivated by good things I don't think she is I think she's super gross NJ Grant says go on bitch shoot and find freedom report Kevin J Johnson has to say about Andrew Scheer we've had Kevin J Johnson on our show before he has been charged with hate crimes for criticizing radical Islam or Muslim politicians I forget the exact details I don't follow Kevin J Johnson closely I did see him I bumped into him on the streets actually in Calgary where he seems to be based these days but I think it's outrageous that he has been prosecuted literally with a criminal offense prosecuted with a crime for having a political point of view can disagree with him you can even call him dead wrong but how can Kevin J Johnson be facing criminal prosecution and Nora Loreto be the star on the CBC state broadcaster by the way I don't want Nora Loreto to be prosecuted in case there's any doubt I'm just pointing out how we use censorship laws very politically in this country let's grab some more comments pepper 5 to 435 says why doesn't the conservative media talk about hue unknown well I'm just really heard about cueing on in the in the last week or so and I heard about it from Roseanne Barr because she she's not scared of talking about anything so I followed it a bit and it really is I mean feels like a game like a fun game like clues and tips and stuff and I think if you treat it that way I think you're okay but I think you start investing it with any real power of the secret conspiracy I think that's the wrong way to go and here's my thoughts on conspiracy theories the world is crazy enough without conspiracy theories you don't need conspiracy theories to be appalled about raged and motivate motivated Act and what I mean by that is a conspiracy theory is a theory it alleges facts that we don't yet know that's why it's just call it theory conspiracy facts are different there are conspiracies a conspiracy as people conspiring together usually in secret to do something Millian obviously conspiracies exist for some reason the Gunpowder Plot just jumped into my head that's a conspiracy 911 was a conspiracy there are enough real conspiracies the conspiracies of al-qaeda just to be crystal clear on that um there are enough conspiracies out there and there's enough conspiracies out there in the open that we don't have to make up fake ones I see some comments about Soros I just saw the word servos flushed by let me give you an example of a conspiracy fact about George Soros you do not need to engage in conspiracy theories about Soros because what he brazenly openly and proudly admits to doing is surely as shocking as anything cooked up by a conspiracy theorist for example and you can find this quite quickly online George Soros and his front group called the open societies have signed a written contract with Justin Trudeau in the Government of Canada to develop immigration policy for Canada I know that sounds absurd and bizarre that a foreign lobbyist billionaire activist in New York City would write the immigration policy for Canada and independent country but that's what he's doing and this is not a conspiracy theory this is published on the government of Canada's own documents their own website their own Gazette Justin Trudeau meets with George Soros not infrequently and he boasts by publishing the photos thereof so you don't need a conspiracy theory and when you see when you read what the George Soros and his lobby group believes ought to be the future of open borders mass migration especially Muslim migration and you know that he is the contracts to write Canadian immigration policy I get mad son of theory it's a fact why would you bother coming up with a theory I mean I understand when you're looking at the American situation especially the deep state and as we were talking about people like Comey and clapper and and and a lot of the intrigues around the Democrats trying to really have a bloodless coup against Donald Trump yeah conspiracies are filling in the gaps because we see such bad behavior on the part of the FBI and other agencies and hopefully in time the facts will be aired out on those things so we can replace conspiracy theories with true facts and I think you will in fact find that there were conspirators I mean Jim Comey the meeting between the Attorney General they're getting with Loretta Lynch and Bill Clinton when Hillary Clinton was under investigation for the emails that's not a conspiracy theory that really happened and they really did try and keep that secret as you know they they both flew into an airport and they had a no cameras meaning that's a crazy conspiring that's a conspiracy we don't yet have all the facts on that you don't need to make things up and I think you and on is just a fun if it's like an Easter egg hunt so I'm not gonna put too much stock in it okay let's go back to the comments El Chapo Cobb says another meeting with the cons I think you're talking about Justin Trudeau meeting with the Agha Khan you're right and there's a brazenness to that of course the agakhan I'm an admirer of the smiley Muslim community that he leads they're very moderate progressive pro-western liberal they believe in the Equality of men and women they're nonviolent in fact they're persecuted by other Muslims who don't even acknowledge that they're genuine Muslims I'm talking about these smileys and the agua con himself is very liberal and very generous i if every Muslim in the world was his liberal generous progressive western-oriented as the smileys this world would be a happy peaceful prosperous place alas they are not even regarded as true Muslims by most of the Muslim community they're like the Amida is that way another persecuted minority so I like the avocado should put that out there and I like his Smiley's I had a hand in the election of Rahim jaffer I was a helper in his original campaign but Justin Trudeau sucked up to the avocado to get free vacations for his family and his grasping wife Sophie kept calling for more vacations for her and her friends without Justin Trudeau to go along if you read the Trudeau report which is what the ethics commissioners report is called you'll see that Trudeau didn't just go there with his family and friends his grasping wife Sophie called up later and said hey man can I come back with my friends he had Justin won't be alone I just wanna bring my friends and can you imagine you're the Agha Khan and I think his daughter took took the the email or the call and she said well we're not going to be there and Sophie Trudeau said yeah that's fine if we just want we just want a party on billionaires Island could you imagine after Trudeau was found guilty he was convicted a breaking mat conflict of ethics law four times the first Prime Minister in Canadian history found guilty of breaking that law four times and yet he goes for a photo op for the same with the same man later on I'm what is that that shows an entitlement but it shows a brazen this that he knows he's gonna get away with it because what are you gonna do what are you gonna do about it you think the CBC is gonna get all mad at the guy who signs the the cheque you think the rest of the media party butts looking to bag a few handouts you think they're gonna get mad you think you think it's gonna be held to account in any way of course I mean we had a months-long criminal trial of Mike Duffy over some expenses that by the way were paid back months and months he was acquitted you think you're gonna get a criminal trial of justin trudeau he laughs he laughs at you he laughs at all of us that's what his meeting with the agakhan this past week was about it was about showing they didn't give a damn about any ethics commissioner he doesn't give a damn about you and he doesn't give a damn about what little bad press he gets because he'll keep doing what he's what he does and what are you actually going to do about it folks my clock says it's 1258 I'm gonna take one more comment make a quick reply and then we're going to go see CN cross Canon News says Liberals have no soul the road to hell is littered with the bodies of dead liberals Suzanne AB says wait we have Policy Analysis for Policy or something a little bit of swearing you know we try and keep the swearing down here then there's some Star Wars talk I'm just gonna skip that okay you know what I'm gonna skip those comments there's so many comments and I want to read them out loud as I'm reading them and some of them I just I don't know how to interact with thanks for joining again today tomorrow as we said yesterday it's gonna be nothing but comments nothing becomes and I appreciated the comment about the coupon code for Broncos and this great question and ask your questions about the rebel I mean I love the rebel I founded it with eight friends when the Sun news networks shut down we've grown it since then we've had our ups and downs but I think we've made a real difference we've had hundreds of millions of views of our videos not just on YouTube but on other platforms too like Twitter Facebook and we now have our own proprietary server called site you know we have covered stories that others have not we have had real live events like our carbon tax protest and I think got the ball rolling and proud of what we did and I'm happy to turn this into a bit of a town hall forum on the rabble itself I don't want to just be navel-gazing and just talk about me me me but if you have questions about the rabble I think I'm probably the guy to answer them so that's tomorrow from 12:00 noon Eastern to 1:00 p.m. Eastern we'll just do comments and if you want your comments go to the top oh I think there's one last super chat let me take a peek Allie Clark says great show thanks well Thank You Allie and thanks for the five bucks goes to pay the bills over here I'm gonna wrap it up because my clock says one o'clock on the dot everybody thanks for tuning in to battleground with Ezra Levante until tomorrow keep fighting for freedom
