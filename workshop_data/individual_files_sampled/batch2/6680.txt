Brent Walder was running some pretty tough ads calling out corruption and they say he's too liberal for doing that just hilarious and then I want to tell you about his opponent and the folks that are supporting his opponent and and what the reality is because there's a lot of money that is coming in to try to crush this great progressive candidate so first I want to show you the ads that Brent's running in the middle of Kansas I'm Brent welder and like you I know that giant corporations and billionaires control our government that's why I wrote the Democratic amendment banning corporate money and I refuse corporate PAC money for my own campaign I'm Brent welder and I approve this message I kind of love what his opponents are doing they're saying that he's too progressive for Kansas so using the message of being against the corporate takeover of our government isn't going to work in Kansas can't wait to meet you in the voting booth okay my guess is the people of Kansas also don't want the corporate donors bribing our politicians that's why Brent doesn't take any of their bribes he turns that corporate pac money that's why your small dollar donations to him make a big difference but he's also going after the Republican really hard Kevin Yoder he already is beating him by 7 points but part of the reason is his attitude because here's another ad from Brett I'm Brent welder if congressman Yoder doesn't have the guts to stand up to Donald Trump and corrupt Wall Street loan sharks I will he's not just selling out he's selling us out I'm Brent welder and I approve this message because Kevin Yoder your time is up now of course it's corporate Democrats don't like that so they're running a corporate lawyer against them and they they don't want to be that tough on Kevin Yoder because they think being a closer the Republicans in Kansas might help them win they've tried that strategy over and over again it has not worked this is a district that Bernie Sanders won easily during the primary season and is a district that Hillary Clinton won in the middle of Kansas let an actual progressive who is beating the incumbent by seven points flip the seat blue get out of the way but they won't now that doesn't mean that I think they should drop out of the primary No I believe in primaries and there should be healthy debate of ideas our idea is non corporate PAC uncorrupted their idea is well let's be more Republican light so but what is frustrating is they put in a ton of money so the corporate Democrats in this case in the form of emily's list which pretends to be for women's rights but actually is almost every time backing the more conservative candidate and also in this case is going to put in over six hundred and thirty thousand dollars to try to defeat Brent welder wait a minute first of all I thought the corporate Democrats told us to not spend our money in primaries that that was always some money Brent was already in the race brent was already beating the Republican incumbent but you didn't like how progressive he was so all of a sudden here comes six hundred thousand dollars wasted to run ads against the guy who's leading the Republican incumbent why no it's got to be someone who's more Perot corporate so his opponent by the way they brag worked in the Obama White House I had a fellowship there the part of the story they leave out is she continued that fellowship into the Trump White House and despite the attack against Affordable Care Act and the Muslim ban and all the egregious things that Donald Trump did she didn't quit she kept working for Trump in his White House that's the one they think should represent progressives in Kansas and they're gonna spend an ungodly sum of money to try to make that happen TYT Kansas calm that is a way to contribute to Brent welder's campaign are small dollar donations I believe will defeat their giant money donations but you have got to get involved either volunteer or donate today t ort Kansas com
