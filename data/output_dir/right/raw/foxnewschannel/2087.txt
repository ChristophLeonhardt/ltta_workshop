00:00:06,066 --> 00:00:08,468
ELECTION.

00:00:11,805 --> 00:00:13,573
WE EXPECT THE PRESIDENT TO TAKE

6
00:00:13,573 --> 00:00:15,642
THE STAGE AT ABOUT 1:20.

7
00:00:15,642 --> 00:00:17,143
THOSE REMARKS LIVE AS THEY

8
00:00:17,143 --> 00:00:18,745
HAPPEN ON THIS SPECIAL EDITION

A COUPLE OF HUNDREDS YARDS FROM

WHERE YOU WERE IN NOVEMBER AND

00:00:26,753 --> 00:00:28,488
I'VE GOT TO TELL YOU, IT'S A

15
00:00:28,488 --> 00:00:30,657
LITTLE BIT WARMER, BUT NO LESS

16
00:00:30,657 --> 00:00:31,224
DIVIDED HERE.

17
00:00:31,224 --> 00:00:33,460
ELIZABETH: THAT'S RIGHT, I'M

18
00:00:33,460 --> 00:00:34,861
ELIZABETH PRANN.

19
00:00:34,861 --> 00:00:36,630
THANK YOU FOR JOINING US.

20
00:00:36,630 --> 00:00:37,497
WE REMEMBER THAT PRESIDENT TRUMP

21
00:00:37,497 --> 00:00:39,566
WON OHIO IN NOVEMBER BY EIGHT

22
00:00:39,566 --> 00:00:39,933
POINTS.

23
00:00:39,933 --> 00:00:41,268
THAT BEING SAID, IT'S NO

24
00:00:41,268 --> 00:00:42,202
INDICATION WHAT WE'LL SEE ON

25
00:00:42,202 --> 00:00:43,937
TUESDAY AND YOU'RE GETTING A

26
00:00:43,937 --> 00:00:44,471
PREVIEW FOR US.

27
00:00:44,471 --> 00:00:45,872
LELAND: DEFINITELY, A PREVIEW,

28
00:00:45,872 --> 00:00:47,741
BOTH FROM THE DEMOCRATIC SIDE,

29
00:00:47,741 --> 00:00:49,576
THE REPUBLICAN SIDE, AS WELL.

30
00:00:49,576 --> 00:00:51,611
SOME OF THE ISSUES HERE, THE

31
00:00:51,611 --> 00:00:53,713
PRIMARIES HERE IN OHIO ARE THE

32
00:00:53,713 --> 00:00:55,482
FIRST STATE-WIDE ELECTION SINCE

33
00:00:55,482 --> 00:00:57,784
THE BUCKEYE STATE WENT FOR

34
00:00:57,784 --> 00:01:01,187
PRESIDENT TRUMP IN 2016.

35
00:01:01,187 --> 00:01:03,623
IT WAS KEY ON HIS ROAD TO THE

36
00:01:03,623 --> 00:01:05,292
WHITE HOUSE, BUT THERE ARE BIG

37
00:01:05,292 --> 00:01:08,995
QUESTIONS NOW ABOUT JUST HOW BIG

38
00:01:08,995 --> 00:01:11,398
HIS COAT TAILS ARE.

39
00:01:11,398 --> 00:01:14,734
AS WE SPEAK THE PRESIDENT IS

40
00:01:14,734 --> 00:01:18,038
HERE AT A CAMPAIGN EVENT FOR HIS

41
00:01:18,038 --> 00:01:18,371
PICK.

42
00:01:18,371 --> 00:01:20,957
FIRST THOUGH TO THE HOT LY

43
00:01:20,957 --> 00:01:21,141
FIRST THOUGH TO THE HOT L

44
00:01:21,141 --> 00:01:23,009
FIRST THOUGH TO THE HOTLY

45
00:01:23,009 --> 00:01:25,111
CONTESTED RACE TO REPLACE JOHN

46
00:01:25,111 --> 00:01:25,512
KASICH.

47
00:01:25,512 --> 00:01:26,212
THERE WERE FOUR REPUBLICAN

48
00:01:26,212 --> 00:01:28,181
CANDIDATES AND THERE ARE NOW

49
00:01:28,181 --> 00:01:30,950
TWO, ONE OF THEM CURRENT LT.

50
00:01:30,950 --> 00:01:32,552
GOVERNOR MARY TAYLOR TO JOINS US

51
00:01:32,552 --> 00:01:33,019
NOW.

52
00:01:33,019 --> 00:01:34,854
NICE TO SEE YOU, MA'AM.

53
00:01:34,854 --> 00:01:35,422
APPRECIATE IT.

54
00:01:35,422 --> 00:01:36,556
BEAUTIFUL DAY TO BE IN

55
00:01:36,556 --> 00:01:36,923
CLEVELAND.

56
00:01:36,923 --> 00:01:37,657
>> WELCOME TO CLEVELAND.

57
00:01:37,657 --> 00:01:38,792
LELAND: IT'S GREAT TO BE HERE,

58
00:01:38,792 --> 00:01:40,593
WE'LL START WITH THIS, ON THE

59
00:01:40,593 --> 00:01:42,929
SENATE SIDE, BOTH CANDIDATES ARE

60
00:01:42,929 --> 00:01:44,097
WRAPPING THEMSELVES IN WHO IS

61
00:01:44,097 --> 00:01:46,366
MORE TRUMP THAN THE OTHER ONE.

62
00:01:46,366 --> 00:01:48,134
IS THAT TRUE IN THE GOVERNOR'S

63
00:01:48,134 --> 00:01:48,435
RACE?

64
00:01:48,435 --> 00:01:51,538
>> SO WHAT WE SEE IN OHIO AND IT

65
00:01:51,538 --> 00:01:54,407
MIGHT BE DIFFERENT HERE THAN

66
00:01:54,407 --> 00:01:55,442
ANYPLACE ELSE.

67
00:01:55,442 --> 00:01:56,509
PRESIDENT TRUMP ENJOYS

68
00:01:56,509 --> 00:01:57,811
UNBELIEVABLE SUPPORT FROM

69
00:01:57,811 --> 00:01:59,279
REPUBLICAN PRIMARY VOTERS.

70
00:01:59,279 --> 00:02:02,082
EVERY POLL I'VE SEEN THE EVENTS

71
00:02:02,082 --> 00:02:04,184
OVER 170 EVENTS THERE'S

72
00:02:04,184 --> 00:02:05,185
EXTRAORDINARY SUPPORT FOR OUR

73
00:02:05,185 --> 00:02:06,720
PRESIDENT TODAY IN THIS STATE,

74
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:08,755
AS MUCH IF NOT MORE THAN IN

75
00:02:08,755 --> 00:02:09,889
NOVEMBER OF 2016.

76
00:02:09,889 --> 00:02:11,324
LELAND: IS THAT TRUE ONLY OF

77
00:02:11,324 --> 00:02:13,626
PRIMARY VOTERS OR IS THAT TRUE

78
00:02:13,626 --> 00:02:14,027
STATE-WIDE?

79
00:02:14,027 --> 00:02:15,762
>> SO, RIGHT NOW WE'RE REALLY

80
00:02:15,762 --> 00:02:17,964
LOOKING MOSTLY OR--

81
00:02:17,964 --> 00:02:19,199
>> OBVIOUSLY--

82
00:02:19,199 --> 00:02:19,632
THREE DAYS.

83
00:02:19,632 --> 00:02:21,134
>> IT'S THREE DAYS OUT.

84
00:02:21,134 --> 00:02:22,335
SO, IT'S IMPORTANT TO SUPPORT

85
00:02:22,335 --> 00:02:22,869
THE PRESIDENT.

86
00:02:22,869 --> 00:02:24,537
THAT'S WHAT, YOU KNOW, WE HAVE

87
00:02:24,537 --> 00:02:26,005
LEARNED IN THIS STATE FOR THE

88
00:02:26,005 --> 00:02:27,440
LAST YEAR AND A HALF AND IT'S

89
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:29,609
IMPORTANT TO SUPPORT HIS

90
00:02:29,609 --> 00:02:29,976
POLICIES.

91
00:02:29,976 --> 00:02:31,511
LELAND: WHAT POLICIES, IS IT

92
00:02:31,511 --> 00:02:33,513
SPECIFIC TO POLICIES OR IS IT

93
00:02:33,513 --> 00:02:36,950
SPECIFIC TO HIS VIEW OF THE

94
00:02:36,950 --> 00:02:37,250
WORLD?

95
00:02:37,250 --> 00:02:39,152
>> IT'S IMPORTANT TO SUPPORT HIS

96
00:02:39,152 --> 00:02:39,519
POLICIES.

97
00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:40,153
LELAND: WHAT POLICIES?

98
00:02:40,153 --> 00:02:41,154
>> SO YOU THINK ABOUT WHAT HE'S

99
00:02:41,154 --> 00:02:42,389
GOING TO TALK ABOUT TODAY, THE

100
00:02:42,389 --> 00:02:44,224
TAX REFORM, THE TAX CUTS, TRUMP

101
00:02:44,224 --> 00:02:46,259
TAX CUTS AND TALKING TO SMALL

102
00:02:46,259 --> 00:02:47,627
BUSINESSES AND UNDERSTANDING.

103
00:02:47,627 --> 00:02:48,461
THIS IS HAVING A REALLY GOOD

104
00:02:48,461 --> 00:02:50,196
POSITIVE IMPACT.

105
00:02:50,196 --> 00:02:51,631
I TALKED TO SMALL BUSINESSES WHO

106
00:02:51,631 --> 00:02:55,335
SAID THE ECONOMY LOOKS GREAT FOR

107
00:02:55,335 --> 00:02:55,668
THEM.

108
00:02:55,668 --> 00:02:57,470
AND THAT'S GREAT NEWS.

109
00:02:57,470 --> 00:02:59,172
IT'S PUTTING OHIOANS BACK TO

110
00:02:59,172 --> 00:03:01,241
WORK AND IN OHIO WE SUPPORT AND

111
00:03:01,241 --> 00:03:02,609
I SUPPORT PRESIDENT TRUMP, BUILD

112
00:03:02,609 --> 00:03:04,344
THE WALL, SECURE OUR BORDERS.

113
00:03:04,344 --> 00:03:05,812
SHUT DOWN SANCTUARY CITIES IN

114
00:03:05,812 --> 00:03:08,915
THE STATE OF OHIO AND ACROSS OUR

115
00:03:08,915 --> 00:03:09,482
COUNTRY.

116
00:03:09,482 --> 00:03:13,086
KEEP OUR PEOPLE SAFE, KEEP THE

117
00:03:13,086 --> 00:03:14,053
PROMISES YOU MADE.

118
00:03:14,053 --> 00:03:15,522
THAT'S IN FACT WHAT THE

119
00:03:15,522 --> 00:03:16,823
PRESIDENT IS DOING.

120
00:03:16,823 --> 00:03:18,324
LELAND: YOU HAVE BEEN LT.

121
00:03:18,324 --> 00:03:21,761
GOVERNOR FOR LONGER THAN THE

122
00:03:21,761 --> 00:03:23,863
PRESIDENT HAS BEEN PRESIDENT.

123
00:03:23,863 --> 00:03:25,398
VALERIE JARRETT SAYING A LOT OF

124
00:03:25,398 --> 00:03:26,566
ECONOMIC GROWTH WE'RE SEEING IN

125
00:03:26,566 --> 00:03:28,668
OHIO AND STATES IN THE MIDWEST,

126
00:03:28,668 --> 00:03:29,402
YEAH, PERHAPS PRESIDENT TRUMP

127
00:03:29,402 --> 00:03:31,905
HAD SOMETHING TO DO WITH IT, BUT

128
00:03:31,905 --> 00:03:34,407
THE ECONOMIC BOOM OF 2010

129
00:03:34,407 --> 00:03:36,276
THROUGH 2016 ALSO CONTRIBUTED TO

130
00:03:36,276 --> 00:03:37,043
IT.

131
00:03:37,043 --> 00:03:37,544
IS THAT FAIR?

132
00:03:37,544 --> 00:03:38,945
WHAT CAN YOU TRACE DIRECTLY TO

133
00:03:38,945 --> 00:03:39,712
PRESIDENT TRUMP?

134
00:03:39,712 --> 00:03:41,314
>> SO IF YOU THINK ABOUT WHERE

135
00:03:41,314 --> 00:03:42,849
WE COULD HAVE BEEN TODAY, WE'RE

136
00:03:42,849 --> 00:03:45,084
AT THE END OF THAT TEN-YEAR

137
00:03:45,084 --> 00:03:46,352
CYCLE WHERE THE ECONOMY WOULD

138
00:03:46,352 --> 00:03:46,986
HAVE--

139
00:03:46,986 --> 00:03:48,388
IF YOU LOOK BACK IN HISTORY

140
00:03:48,388 --> 00:03:49,656
WOULD HAVE CURVED DOWN AND IN

141
00:03:49,656 --> 00:03:51,057
FACT, IT HASN'T DONE THAT

142
00:03:51,057 --> 00:03:52,492
BECAUSE TRUMP POLICIES ARE

143
00:03:52,492 --> 00:03:52,859
WORKING.

144
00:03:52,859 --> 00:03:54,561
ALTHOUGH WE'VE MADE PROGRESS IN

145
00:03:54,561 --> 00:03:56,262
OHIO AND I THINK YOU SAID OR I

146
00:03:56,262 --> 00:03:57,730
HEARD EARLIER, LOWEST

147
00:03:57,730 --> 00:03:59,732
UNEMPLOYMENT WE'VE SEEN IN HOW

148
00:03:59,732 --> 00:04:00,033
LONG.

149
00:04:00,033 --> 00:04:00,800
LELAND: 3.9%.

150
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:03,036
>> IT'S EXTRAORDINARY, BUT WHEN

151
00:04:03,169 --> 00:04:05,171
THEY SAY THE ECONOMY IS BETTER

152
00:04:05,171 --> 00:04:07,273
THAN THEY EXPECTED AND THEIR

153
00:04:07,273 --> 00:04:08,741
OUTLOOK FOR THE FUTURE IS BETTER

154
00:04:08,741 --> 00:04:10,043
THAN THEY EXPECTED AND PRESIDENT

155
00:04:10,043 --> 00:04:11,611
TRUMP'S BEEN IN OFFICE FOR A

156
00:04:11,611 --> 00:04:13,213
YEAR AND A HALF, AND A LOT OF

157
00:04:13,213 --> 00:04:14,380
THAT'S ATTRIBUTED TO THE

158
00:04:14,380 --> 00:04:15,748
POLICIES THAT HE'S PUT IN PLACE

159
00:04:15,748 --> 00:04:17,884
AND THE OTHER THINGS HE'S DOING

160
00:04:17,884 --> 00:04:20,519
TO IMPROVE THE LIVES OF

161
00:04:20,519 --> 00:04:20,887
AMERICANS.

162
00:04:20,887 --> 00:04:21,921
LELAND: ONE KEY PART OF

163
00:04:21,921 --> 00:04:22,956
PRESIDENT TRUMP'S MESSAGE HAS

164
00:04:22,956 --> 00:04:25,158
BEEN THIS, I'M AN OUTSIDER, I'M

165
00:04:25,158 --> 00:04:26,893
NOT A POLITICIAN AND I PROMISED

166
00:04:26,893 --> 00:04:28,495
I WOULD NOT USE THE WORD

167
00:04:28,495 --> 00:04:29,829
OUTSIDER DURING THIS ENTIRE SHOW

168
00:04:29,829 --> 00:04:31,998
BECAUSE I'VE HEARD IT TOO MUCH

169
00:04:31,998 --> 00:04:33,566
ON TELEVISION IN THE ADS.

170
00:04:33,566 --> 00:04:34,834
BUT IT'S THIS IDEA OF A

171
00:04:34,834 --> 00:04:36,903
DIFFERENT TYPE OF POLITICIAN.

172
00:04:36,903 --> 00:04:38,738
THE ATTACK ON YOU IS A LITTLE

173
00:04:38,738 --> 00:04:39,138
DIFFERENT.

174
00:04:39,138 --> 00:04:40,640
I WANT TO SHOW YOU AN AD THAT'S

175
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:42,609
RUNNING IN OHIO AND GET YOUR

176
00:04:42,609 --> 00:04:43,676
REACTION.

177
00:04:43,676 --> 00:04:45,011
TAKE A LISTEN.

178
00:04:45,011 --> 00:04:46,913
>> IS MARY TAYLOR READY TO BE

179
00:04:46,913 --> 00:04:47,614
GOVERNOR?

180
00:04:47,614 --> 00:04:49,349
TAYLOR CAN'T KEEP HER STAFF,

181
00:04:49,349 --> 00:04:50,650
RAISING QUESTIONS ABOUT HER

182
00:04:50,650 --> 00:04:51,985
LEADERSHIP AND OVERSIGHT.

183
00:04:51,985 --> 00:04:54,454
SHE WAS BUSTED USING THE STATE'S

184
00:04:54,454 --> 00:04:56,422
AIRPLANE FOR PERSONAL USE AND

185
00:04:56,422 --> 00:04:58,324
TAYLOR IS DOGGED BY RUMOR THAT

186
00:04:58,324 --> 00:05:00,593
SHE SKIPS OUT ON WORK, A SLACKER

187
00:05:00,593 --> 00:05:02,428
WHOSE WORK SCHEDULE IS ALMOST

188
00:05:02,428 --> 00:05:02,862
UNTRACEABLE.

189
00:05:02,862 --> 00:05:05,732
MARY TAYLOR, UNFIT AND

190
00:05:05,732 --> 00:05:07,483
UNQUALIFIED

191
00:05:07,483 --> 00:05:08,401
UNQUALIFIE

192
00:05:08,401 --> 00:05:08,801
UNQUALIFIED.

193
00:05:08,801 --> 00:05:09,736
LELAND: IMPLICIT IN THAT IS THIS

194
00:05:09,736 --> 00:05:11,804
IDEA THAT YOU'RE JUST ANOTHER

195
00:05:11,804 --> 00:05:13,773
POLITICIAN, IS THAT A TOUGHER

196
00:05:13,773 --> 00:05:16,009
REPUTATION TO SHAKE IN THIS

197
00:05:16,009 --> 00:05:16,943
CURRENT CLIMATE?

198
00:05:16,943 --> 00:05:18,545
>> SO, THIS IS WHAT I HAVEN'T

199
00:05:18,545 --> 00:05:20,914
SEEN THIS ONE, JUST MY OPPONENT

200
00:05:20,914 --> 00:05:23,149
LYING ABOUT ME ON TV BECAUSE HE

201
00:05:23,149 --> 00:05:24,884
CAN'T DEFEND HIS OWN LIBERAL

202
00:05:24,884 --> 00:05:25,251
RECORD.

203
00:05:25,251 --> 00:05:26,386
IN FACT, IT'S NOT TRUE.

204
00:05:26,386 --> 00:05:28,087
I SPENT 16 YEARS WORKING IN THE

205
00:05:28,087 --> 00:05:30,156
PRIVATE SECTOR AS A C.P.A.

206
00:05:30,156 --> 00:05:31,190
I UNDERSTAND WHAT IT MEANS TO

207
00:05:31,190 --> 00:05:32,692
CREATE A JOB IN THE PRIVATE

208
00:05:32,692 --> 00:05:33,059
SECTOR.

209
00:05:33,059 --> 00:05:34,394
MY OPPONENT HAS BEEN ON THE

210
00:05:34,394 --> 00:05:38,197
PUBLIC DOLE FOR 42 YEARS AND HAS

211
00:05:38,197 --> 00:05:39,465
HAD NO PRIVATE SECTOR

212
00:05:39,465 --> 00:05:41,267
EXPERIENCE.

213
00:05:41,267 --> 00:05:42,468
SO, IT'S UNFORTUNATE WE ARE IN

214
00:05:42,468 --> 00:05:44,771
THAT SILLY SEASON AS WE CALL IT

215
00:05:44,771 --> 00:05:45,705
IN POLITICS.

216
00:05:45,705 --> 00:05:47,006
WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO IS FOCUS

217
00:05:47,006 --> 00:05:50,743
ON WHAT I BRING TO THE TABLE,

218
00:05:50,743 --> 00:05:52,679
NOT ONLY MY PRIVATE SECTOR

219
00:05:52,679 --> 00:05:53,746
EXPERIENCE, BUT POLICIES WE PUSH

220
00:05:53,746 --> 00:05:57,584
TO MAKOO

221
00:05:57,584 --> 00:05:57,700

TO MAMAKOO--

00:05:58,618 --> 00:06:00,853
MAKE OHIO A BETTER STATE TO WORK

231
00:06:00,853 --> 00:06:01,888
AND LIVE.

232
00:06:01,888 --> 00:06:05,491
LELAND: AND YOU SAID PRESIDENT

233
00:06:05,491 --> 00:00:00,000
TRUMP WON BY EIGHT.
