in dollars in the last three months there she is and a brand new NBC Marisa poet how are now has a two point lead over Rosen forty-six among likely voters to her 44 anyway however a Real Clear Politics average of the most recent polls show Rosen with a two-point edge over how much this is back and forth meanwhile in text is a deep red state of course US congressman better award is running a surprisingly various competitive race against the somewhat unliked incumbent Ted Cruz a new ad out by a famous director takes Cruz to task for supporting President Trump let's watch this somebody left something on my door the other day is that Ted Cruz toughest taxes I mean come on if somebody called my wife a dog and said my daddy was in on the Kennedy assassination I wouldn't be kissing their ass you stick a finger in their chest and give them a few choice words or you drag her ass out by the woodshed and kick their ass the last time Joe may run ralston editor of the Nevada independent and Abbie Livingston the Washington bureau chief for the great Texas Tribune newspaper John let's start with Nevada it seems to me that Jackie Rose it has to win or the Democrats are not going to pick up the net two seats to take control of the Senate it's the best bet they got yeah and I think there's a lot of folks in Washington Chris who thought that Heller was a dead duck for a long time because he apparently is trying to lose this race and not succeeding by taking every position he can on repealing Obamacare by just getting caught on tape saying foolish things by having a campaign that really has not been that great and really has only had one strategy Chris which is to be in love with Trump and then be in love with Cavanaugh changing how he was before to try to hope that the base will turn out as they often do in midterms and especially in Nevada Democrats don't do well here and he can hold out as you mentioned the polling has gone back and forth it's been a margin of error race all year long and I think Democrats are really worried both here and nationally that Heller who has never lost a race can hold on you know I think about I almost from the cartoon joist I tell people you know it's the one state where you meet the union workers you you mean the whole time you're in Vegas for example in Clark County you're meeting Union people they're not people behind some factory line somewhere they're waiting your table their casino of their booty call them up croupier stand whatever their pit bosses they're all over the place Union people and then you have that other thing that rural Mormon LDS culture that's also out there how do you measure one against the other two so the big city Vegas crowd which is a lot of women workers union workers are women on the Left sort of in terms of practicality and then you have that quiet more rural warming crowd what's the power because you know you but out here you you've talked to all these folks right you've been in the casinos that vote is crucial that that culinary worker vote they represent 50,000 or so folks that's what helped Harry Reid survive in a midterm even though his numbers were as terrible as Heller and then you talk about rural Nevada they love Trump out there they want to hang Democrats in effigy they're gonna vote in huge numbers for Heller but that's only about 15 to 18 percent of the vote so you're really threading a needle there to try to get the landslide there to make up for what you're gonna lose in Clark County and that makes Reno and Washoe County the swing County where if the Democrats can at least holding their their own there they should win but that's exactly Nevada you said it's essentially two states it's really three with the rural Southern Nevada and then Reno which which is where the swing voters really are in Katy Terry's out there today with you anyway an interview with NBC's Lester Holt senator Cruz of Texas was asked about our Rourke's challenge to him here's what Cruz had to say I think it's the sign of the times nationally that that the extreme left they're really angry and they're energized and we're seeing that in Texas well that's on the roof here ya be what are you making this race I've been sensing that that the metal work has got more guts than most people have ever had their life he's taken on a guy that nobody could beat and yet he's fallen he's a little bit behind him and he sort of stuck there it seems like the race is stabilized with him trailing by about five points and that five points is a huge amount to make up an estate as populous as Texas I can say I've been covering politics in Texas for a long time and I've lived it as a kid and I've never seen a race like this before what could turn in what way because I say he seems to be so damned attractive as a candidate the Kennedy of connections obviously been mentioned he's getting out the people in the crowds how do you translate those crowds to voters in the booth well what I do wonder when we look at these polls there's look at these crowds this is the people in most states would die for this kind of enthusiasm I've been to these events it feels like New Hampshire a week out before presidential primary I think what it will take is if we look back at the Virginia gubernatorial race last year it seemed neck and neck between the Republican and Democrat and the Republican actually lost by nine points so my question is can the polling detect this kind of enthusiasm and that's to me the path for him along with consolidating the Hispanic vote if he gets a turnout on the Democratic side consistent with a presidential year that wouldn't even be enough though he has to get better than that doesn't it absolutely Hillary Clinton lost Texas by nine points which was a significant step forward for Democrats but it's really hard to underscore how difficult this can be but again I've never seen anything like this and I can imagine a stranger things have happened in American politics why does Cruz he seems like an unpopular sort of personality to most of us look at him he's not a charmer by any means he's arrogant he used to say when he was in law school he wouldn't study with the kids that went to Penn you know they had to cut the Yale or Harvard or Princeton he's arrogant and maybe that's some people like arrogant how about the Hispanic vote the Latino vote how does he get 30-some percent that happen well I think one thing to remember is the name Cruz is Hispanic and in South Texas in the Rio Grande Valley your last name is extremely important among those Hispanic voters and while Beto has a Spanish nickname his last name is Irish and so that is one thing but also the Hispanic voting bloc in Texas is not monolithic there is a anti-abortion a group and within that sector a student and so it's it's Texas it's just so complex and sometimes it's just not black or white well it's a hell of a race if this may be the number one race in the country John Ralston thank you sir your report tange fantastic hey there I'm Chris Hayes from MSNBC thanks for watching MSNBC on YouTube if you want to keep up to date with the videos
