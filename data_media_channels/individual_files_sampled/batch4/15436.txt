that rowdy bunch was the University of california-irvine chapter of students for justice and Palestine they successfully shut down a pro-israel event at the school these they simply didn't agree with the views being expressed and this wasn't the first time they threw a tantrum here's what the group had to say the next day administration told us not to disrupt last year on May 18 we shut down an IDF panel we shut down their panel so it seems like administrators had told them before to have some common decency how many times who knows watchdog group canary mission caught the UC Irvine SJP chapter disrupting former Israeli ambassador Michael Oren back in 2010 the university put the group on probation after another 2016 hissy fit with that probation expired in March 2017 and SJP disrupted yet another event which resulted in the attendees needing a police escort out of the building I can't believe that we saying it had to defend everyone's free expression without disruption University of california-irvine put SJP on probation again this time until mid 2019 during this time the organization must abide by UCI standards of conduct meet with the Dean of Students six times per year to discuss free speech issues and consult with a representative of the dean's office before hosting or co-hosting any campus event said the school any further violations of university policy may result in suspension or a revocation of the organization's status but probation was the punishment last time UCI and what kind of a punishment even is it so the left-wing group has to get their events approved by left-wing administrators big deal and free speech meetings with UC Irvine administration you know the same administration that suspended its College Republicans chapter for a year after the group rebooked Miley innopolis that sounds like it'll be real informative peaceful protests are a critical part of the First Amendment but shutting down others speech deserves zero tolerance for campus unmasked i'm rob from shocked if you like this video and support our mission please make sure to comment and subscribe if something happens on your campus and you'd like us to investigate send us details using the forum on campus unmask calm
