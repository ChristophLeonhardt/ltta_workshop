Felicia Pearson is probably best known
as snoop one of my co-stars on the wire
before Felicia's career in TV
she served time in a maximum-security
prison
Felicia's troubles began early in life
she was born to a crack addicted mother
and was raised by foster parents in East
Baltimore this is where mama brought you
home from the hospital Yeah right the
house she planted this tree it's a good
luck John you know that well man anybody
that just stabbed it kick it I don't
care what you do to it
some bad luck want to come to you I
promise you and this weird pop used to
all get the switches off the truth did
you know what your biological mother
evidence yeah oh they let me you were
four and she Ted took like my clothes
and stuff and my counselor was like nah
you can't come back the last time you
seen her yeah they said she had got
locked up when I was locked up over City
Jail yeah but I ain't no she was I
probably was recognized because you and
your biological mother would lock up at
the same time yeah
and this probably walked right past you
I think about that all the time
no positive role models she fell deep
into the street life of drugs violence
to ultimately murder so pretty much
everything happened here right I was
sitting on the steps round there
everybody like fight fight fight so used
to run to a fight Noddy
I didn't we all did that dog runs
around this corner huh they fighting
over here I'm over here
like just watching it you know say
shorty comes out swinging
so I'm Stanley Meyer standing right here
and she swinging at Joyce I said yo ho
they said she hit me I don't remember
then so I whip so like y'all back she
said it I said yes too late but it was
her trying to protect herself and me
trying to protect myself I was feeling
alone in this world I didn't care about
nothing Hey absolutely nothing I didn't
care that if I died I didn't care I mean
why can't if your mother and father
don't care nothing about you it's angry
yeah angry angry at the world
angry at myself
but you basically told me that pretty
much everyone you ever had to look up to
in this community basically either you
know what gangsters did time what effect
they had when you mentally had a lot
because I would looked up to him yeah
you know and because there was much
older and I thought that was the right
way I'll use now most definitely need
people with mentors kids now they they
look at you and be like well if you
ain't did this that in the dirt
how can you tell me anything if you
haven't been down this road you can't
tell me
