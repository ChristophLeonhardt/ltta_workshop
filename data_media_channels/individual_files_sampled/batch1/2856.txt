this season we decided to do our very first beverage that incorporates a level of heat into the drink it's actually really different than our traditional mocha so as opposed to a sauce it's a cocoa powder that's infused with some of the fall spices that our customers love in the pumpkin spice so the powders actually steamed in with the milk so it's all kind of incorporated together and then espresso is added and then it's topped with whipped cream and the topping the chili mocha powder that goes on top is where things get really interesting and the topping has cayenne pepper ancho chili paprika sea salt cinnamon and a little bit of sugar so it's a really nice topping to a really awesome fall beverage that we're excited to introduce to our customers
