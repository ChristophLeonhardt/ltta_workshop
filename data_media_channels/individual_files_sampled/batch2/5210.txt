the week that started with the White House campaign to be best as the first lady called it is tonight ending shall we say politely far from that mark let's bring in two smart guys to talk about it with us from Houston is Jon Meacham Pulitzer Prize winning author historian biographer of President Bush 41 whose latest book just out this week we note in time for Mother's Day and we hate to note things like that is the soul of America the battle for our better angels with us from Washington Michael Beschloss the author and presidential historian and biographer of among others President Lyndon Johnson gentlemen welcome before we say another word I'm going to put a picture on the screen that mr. Beschloss supplied to us it looks like two high school kids visiting 41 in Kennebunkport in the center of your screen television veterans will note dead ringer for Ken Olin of 30-something now executive producer of the runaway NBC hit this is us but those are young men Meacham and Beschloss probably trying not to get seasick and listen to the 41st president of the United States so on that note John I note as his biographer you happen to be in Houston tonight inquiring one of my minds want to know if you visited with the former president today I spent about an hour with the former president whom I first met introduced to the bushes by my friend Michael Beschloss and back that was that's exactly 20 years ago wasn't it Michael in the fall nice fall right it was the fall of 98 and what I think you can see in that picture is as ever best loss is smarter than I am because he was behind the glass of the boat and the wind was not blowing him I had a jacket a parachute jacket essentially and was almost blown out to sea so once again Beschloss is ahead spent about an hour with the president this afternoon he I left him sipping his martini in his house in Houston he's looking forward to going to Maine next week and I want to say too perhaps as a a subtle or not so subtle contrast to what we've seen from the incumbent in the White House this week and his staff that while I was there this afternoon an old Navy veteran who had served with President Bush was calling his family had called because this man is on his deathbed in Florida and he had called and the family had wanted President Bush to know this President Bush looked at his chief of staff and said let's get him on the phone the phone was picked up the president's spoke a few words to him spoke a few words of the family the daughter who answered the phone was sobbing because of the former commander-in-chief of the United States who had served with her father and the great struggle against tyranny had taken the time to reach out to a friend and it's a reminder I think of the humanity and the dignity that's so so self-evidently missing from our national life today and Michael Beschloss let's fast forward to a heroic naval 80 aviator shot down in the Vietnam War who sadly has been at the crux of our news coverage for all the wrong reasons what has this quote from inside the White House someone paid with taxpayer funds what has this quote and the White House's failure refusal to apologize revealed or shown to you about this White House right now makes me absolutely furious I Brian you know can you imagine if George HW Bush had employed someone on his White House staff who had said something like what Kelly Sadler was reported to have I mean that person would have been out of that White House so fast and to hear Sarah Sanders said you know almost nonchalantly that that person is still on the White House staff I don't know any president the last hundred years who would leave someone on the staff who had said such what such a horrible thing about one of the great war heroes of American history hey there I'm Chris Hayes from MSNBC thanks for watching MSNBC on youtube if you want to keep up to date with the videos we're putting out you can click subscribe just below me or click over on this list to see lots of other great videos
