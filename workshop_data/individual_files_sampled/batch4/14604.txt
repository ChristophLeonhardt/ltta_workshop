suspended for wanting to show her underwear in English class a teenager in Ontario thinks her school's dress code is rape culture a grade 10 student attending Essex District High School in Ontario has been suspended for protesting the schools dress code the young lady told the CBC that she and several of her friends have been punished and she was sent home after refusing to change her shirt because her bra straps were showing so then to protest what the young lady felt was an unfair rule she and her friends made posters that they put up without permission all around her high school some of them said stop objectifying women I go to school where the length of my shorts are more important than my education and my favorite dress code perpetuates rape culture and a young woman was suspended for this action I'm pretty sure if you're willing to get suspended because the length of your shorts are a big deal to you then yeah the length of your shorts are more important to you than your education which seems like a strange priority for a young person to have anyway the young lady said it's degrading this rule because administration doesn't point out the boys it's always about the girls that just tells me there aren't a lot of boys wearing bras at her high school which also seems pretty reasonable to me but let's just read the dress code together and then you can decide for yourself if it is reasonable or specifically targeting young ladies it reads students are expected to take pride in their appearance by dressing cleanly neatly and appropriately in general all clothing worn to school must be conducive to an academic environment clothing or accessories containing inappropriate or objectionable pictures and/or words such as references to alcohol drugs profanity obscene language statements promoting violence racism or illegal behavior sex including words or phrases with double meaning or gender offensive language are not acceptable in all cases the administration will decide whether or not students are adhering to the dress code standards for example no spaghetti straps or halter tops for girls and no tank tops for boys no revealing facts or midriffs and no short shorts you just read the dress code with me what do you think I think it doesn't have a gendered focus at all I think it's a pretty fair dress code it's about being in a respectful yet learning focused place but for some reason the CBC is avoiding reporting on the full and even-handed actual dress code as opposed to a minor child's interpretation of it as unfair and if you've ever met a 15 or 16 year old person they think everything is unfair that's not a news story actually this isn't a news story at all it's a child's tantrum unchecked by their parents as reported in the state broadcaster because feminism and rape culture or something or other my 11 year old doesn't want to load the dishwasher claims patriarchal oppression through gendered norms story at 11 I think any normal interpretation of that schools dress code is that it's pretty reasonable and while kids will try to get away with whatever they can because they're kids it's certainly up to the grown-ups around the kids to guide them because kids are not fully formed adults high school kids and of course I'm generalizing here are hormonal crazy people who couldn't make a good decision if their lives depended on it it looks like the school is doing their very best to guide the kids which is refreshing for once to see but it also looks like the young lady's mother is flaking out a little bit on her responsibilities to raise a fully-functioning appropriate adult the mum of this young lady whom I won't name because I think this isn't a story and she's also a minor says that she's planning to file a complaint with the school board the mom says she will stand by her daughter 100% and that her daughter is doing the right thing and that her daughter's not just doing it for herself she's doing it for every girl at Essex High School I'm not sure what they're fighting for though the right to show your underwear at school seems like a bizarre Hill to die on when the same rules apply to male students and actually even go one step further because boys can't even wear muscle shirts or tank tops at school at all I'm not being critical of the young girl here she's a minor in high school and almost never do these kids think clearly kids have a real inability to see the long game or the life lesson the adults around them are trying to instill in them it's why they can't vote and as long as there have been dress codes there have been kids who are following the dress code while still finding a way to express themselves it's called creative problem-solving and we want kids to do that or better yet they can express themselves on their own time because a big chunk of high school is about real-world preparation part of high school is also about learning the rules and unwritten and unspoken codes of conduct and behavior that will make a person an attractive employee you know prepping kids for the real world and all that stuff and dressing appropriately in the appropriate circumstances is one of those codified behaviors that has to be learned it's one of those incredibly valuable life lessons that I talked about a little earlier kids need to realize that not everybody will work somewhere where you can wear your favorite conservative sloganeering t-shirt to work like I do whether or not we like it it doesn't really matter because first impressions really are everything that's the reality of the human species we are visual creatures it's how we judge people when we first meet them when we know nothing else about them and that's okay it's one of the reasons we have eyeballs I mean even laundry commercials point out the fact that if your clothes look like you I don't know slept in the trunk your car when you're on a date it leaves a bad impression learning rules of appropriateness and presentation is about respect for your workplace respect for the work that you do and respect for those people around you and I think it is a great shame that this young lady's mom is helping her to avoid ever learning that lesson and is it really any wonder that according to Princeton Millennials are the least prepared generation for the work force ever
