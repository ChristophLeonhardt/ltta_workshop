1
00:00:00,490 --> 00:00:03,879
so NCAA vault what is it the NCAA vault

2
00:00:03,879 --> 00:00:06,880
is basically attached ncaa.com which the

3
00:00:06,880 --> 00:00:09,460
NCAA's web primary website for

4
00:00:09,460 --> 00:00:13,089
championships and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> vault essentially</font>

5
00:00:13,089 --> 00:00:14,830
is a video platform in which we've taken

6
00:00:14,830 --> 00:00:17,109
150 games from the last decade from<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

7
00:00:17,109 --> 00:00:18,279
NCAA<font color="#E5E5E5"> division women's basketball</font>

8
00:00:18,279 --> 00:00:20,230
tournament and open them up to the

9
00:00:20,230 --> 00:00:22,750
<font color="#CCCCCC">public you can</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> access those games free</font>

10
00:00:22,750 --> 00:00:24,490
of charge you can jump into the games at

11
00:00:24,490 --> 00:00:26,259
any point<font color="#E5E5E5"> in time and those games are</font>

12
00:00:26,259 --> 00:00:28,660
from the sweet 16 of the tournament

13
00:00:28,660 --> 00:00:30,400
through the<font color="#CCCCCC"> championship game so it's a</font>

14
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:32,380
really<font color="#CCCCCC"> interesting piece in which we've</font>

15
00:00:32,380 --> 00:00:34,450
enabled consumers to come in and look at

16
00:00:34,450 --> 00:00:37,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">the archive and open it up</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to there to</font>

17
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:38,440
there like and they can they can work

18
00:00:38,440 --> 00:00:41,470
with it<font color="#E5E5E5"> and it's not just a raw you know</font>

19
00:00:41,470 --> 00:00:44,260
several hours of<font color="#E5E5E5"> live games it's every</font>

20
00:00:44,260 --> 00:00:46,210
moment is indexed and there's metadata

21
00:00:46,210 --> 00:00:48,550
so you could look for<font color="#E5E5E5"> a specific shot a</font>

22
00:00:48,550 --> 00:00:50,230
specific moment and then<font color="#CCCCCC"> link directly</font>

23
00:00:50,230 --> 00:00:52,240
to that yes it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> really a new publishing</font>

24
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:54,190
model when it comes to video in

25
00:00:54,190 --> 00:00:57,340
broadband so effectively we've indexed

26
00:00:57,340 --> 00:01:00,130
every play every stat every player for

27
00:01:00,130 --> 00:01:02,260
<font color="#CCCCCC">the sweet 16 championship game or sweet</font>

28
00:01:02,260 --> 00:01:03,610
16 games all the way to the championship

29
00:01:03,610 --> 00:01:06,670
for the last<font color="#CCCCCC"> decade so we've enabled it</font>

30
00:01:06,670 --> 00:01:08,439
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> where every moment is already pre</font>

31
00:01:08,439 --> 00:01:10,149
identified but we've also made it<font color="#E5E5E5"> into</font>

32
00:01:10,149 --> 00:01:12,159
our players so that if the consumer

33
00:01:12,159 --> 00:01:14,530
can't find didn't see what they were

34
00:01:14,530 --> 00:01:17,170
looking for<font color="#E5E5E5"> they can instantly hit you</font>

35
00:01:17,170 --> 00:01:18,579
know and create their own moment<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

36
00:01:18,579 --> 00:01:19,869
post it into facebook twitter and other

37
00:01:19,869 --> 00:01:21,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">social mediums as well and what's the</font>

38
00:01:21,700 --> 00:01:23,560
point of breaking the game<font color="#CCCCCC"> into moments</font>

39
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:25,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">like this as opposed to just chunking it</font>

40
00:01:25,390 --> 00:01:28,600
up into plays the way<font color="#CCCCCC"> youtube might what</font>

41
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:30,009
we found over<font color="#CCCCCC"> time is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that people</font>

42
00:01:30,009 --> 00:01:34,299
consume video online not so much on a on

43
00:01:34,299 --> 00:01:36,819
a full game basis but on a moment basis

44
00:01:36,819 --> 00:01:38,380
people want to be able to instantly jump

45
00:01:38,380 --> 00:01:40,359
into a full game and they<font color="#E5E5E5"> instantly want</font>

46
00:01:40,359 --> 00:01:42,369
to be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to go across any given moment</font>

47
00:01:42,369 --> 00:01:43,780
that's relevant to<font color="#E5E5E5"> them if they just</font>

48
00:01:43,780 --> 00:01:45,579
want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to come in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and get a dunk they can</font>

49
00:01:45,579 --> 00:01:47,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually look at each individual gunk</font>

50
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:49,329
from each individual player and they'll

51
00:01:49,329 --> 00:01:51,159
spend<font color="#CCCCCC"> time breaking the game down and</font>

52
00:01:51,159 --> 00:01:52,659
consuming what they want rather<font color="#E5E5E5"> than</font>

53
00:01:52,659 --> 00:01:54,280
having to watch a<font color="#E5E5E5"> two-hour make a</font>

54
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:55,899
two-hour commitment into a game so it's

55
00:01:55,899 --> 00:01:57,670
all about just more viewership more

56
00:01:57,670 --> 00:01:59,520
dwell time and<font color="#E5E5E5"> getting consumers</font>

57
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:01,749
specific relevance based on<font color="#CCCCCC"> their so</font>

58
00:02:01,749 --> 00:02:02,679
they<font color="#CCCCCC"> can spend</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> their time more</font>

59
00:02:02,679 --> 00:02:04,450
effectively so obviously a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of</font>

60
00:02:04,450 --> 00:02:06,039
college students would watch something

61
00:02:06,039 --> 00:02:08,139
like this a huge endemic audience there

62
00:02:08,139 --> 00:02:10,060
but who else is a site like this for I

63
00:02:10,060 --> 00:02:12,070
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> not only the college audience but</font>

64
00:02:12,070 --> 00:02:13,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">also the media can use it as</font>

65
00:02:13,420 --> 00:02:14,800
well I mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you go back</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and if the</font>

66
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:16,599
media is writing a story and they're

67
00:02:16,599 --> 00:02:19,569
comparing a game from 2003 to a game in

68
00:02:19,569 --> 00:02:20,860
this year's tournament and they want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

69
00:02:20,860 --> 00:02:22,720
talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> to a moment they can easily go in</font>

70
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:24,310
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> link right into the vault that the</font>

71
00:02:24,310 --> 00:02:25,750
exact moment<font color="#CCCCCC"> that they're describing in</font>

72
00:02:25,750 --> 00:02:27,520
the story they can post a link boom

73
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:30,160
takes the consumer right into the vault

74
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:32,950
and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> media</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> thing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can show the example</font>

75
00:02:32,950 --> 00:02:34,209
<font color="#E5E5E5">of exactly what they're trying</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

76
00:02:34,209 --> 00:02:35,739
describe in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the written article so if</font>

77
00:02:35,739 --> 00:02:37,030
you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> a sports blogger you don't have</font>

78
00:02:37,030 --> 00:02:39,220
to hope that an old game is archived on

79
00:02:39,220 --> 00:02:41,230
<font color="#CCCCCC">YouTube and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> then tell someone go to</font>

80
00:02:41,230 --> 00:02:43,930
minute<font color="#CCCCCC"> five second</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> three it's something</font>

81
00:02:43,930 --> 00:02:45,940
you could send a specific link to that

82
00:02:45,940 --> 00:02:48,989
moment<font color="#E5E5E5"> directly from your site to theirs</font>

83
00:02:48,989 --> 00:02:50,709
absolutely i<font color="#CCCCCC"> think we already seeing</font>

84
00:02:50,709 --> 00:02:51,880
that there's some that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> already out</font>

85
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:53,470
there this was out in the soft launch

86
00:02:53,470 --> 00:02:55,330
last week and it's just kind<font color="#CCCCCC"> of virally</font>

87
00:02:55,330 --> 00:02:56,980
taking off and bloggers are already

88
00:02:56,980 --> 00:02:58,390
starting to do that it's great so one

89
00:02:58,390 --> 00:02:59,590
thing you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to hear a lot of</font>

90
00:02:59,590 --> 00:03:01,030
complaints about is you can't right now

91
00:03:01,030 --> 00:03:03,130
embed videos what's what's kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of in</font>

92
00:03:03,130 --> 00:03:04,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">the future of the platform what are some</font>

93
00:03:04,930 --> 00:03:06,549
things you're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to add to it so</font>

94
00:03:06,549 --> 00:03:08,350
we'll add the full<font color="#E5E5E5"> screen capability</font>

95
00:03:08,350 --> 00:03:10,920
right now it's it's designed for

96
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:13,510
actually the consumption<font color="#CCCCCC"> putting more</font>

97
00:03:13,510 --> 00:03:14,860
metadata around it so we'll add the

98
00:03:14,860 --> 00:03:16,780
fullscreen player and we'll also make it

99
00:03:16,780 --> 00:03:18,850
to her eventually we'll add the the

100
00:03:18,850 --> 00:03:20,799
embeddable side of it right now though

101
00:03:20,799 --> 00:03:23,380
people<font color="#E5E5E5"> the consumer web people are</font>

102
00:03:23,380 --> 00:03:24,670
really excited<font color="#CCCCCC"> about is that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> they</font>

103
00:03:24,670 --> 00:03:25,840
<font color="#CCCCCC">actually</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> don't have to come in and</font>

104
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:28,269
search and wait anymore so the speed of

105
00:03:28,269 --> 00:03:29,950
<font color="#CCCCCC">the player is actually extremely fast</font>

106
00:03:29,950 --> 00:03:31,930
the consumers are very happy<font color="#CCCCCC"> because</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

107
00:03:31,930 --> 00:03:33,400
connects directly into their<font color="#CCCCCC"> facebook</font>

108
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:35,950
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> twitter you know commenting sections</font>

109
00:03:35,950 --> 00:03:38,380
so because a lot of<font color="#CCCCCC"> its connected</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to the</font>

110
00:03:38,380 --> 00:03:42,100
social medium player embeds aren't

111
00:03:42,100 --> 00:03:43,690
necessarily is relevant for this first

112
00:03:43,690 --> 00:03:45,280
phase but as it gets more into the

113
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:47,650
<font color="#CCCCCC">blogger space and to the publishing</font>

114
00:03:47,650 --> 00:03:49,120
space that's something that will do for

115
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:50,920
phase two so some sports leagues have

116
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:53,230
done a nice job with mobile and the ipad

117
00:03:53,230 --> 00:03:54,280
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> coming out and these are both</font>

118
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:56,709
platforms where flash is not part of

119
00:03:56,709 --> 00:03:58,450
them and your site right now is<font color="#E5E5E5"> built in</font>

120
00:03:58,450 --> 00:04:01,510
flash can you going forward serve more

121
00:04:01,510 --> 00:04:03,880
platforms yeah so everything in our

122
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:05,440
particular system today it is

123
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:08,620
flash-based however every given moment

124
00:04:08,620 --> 00:04:11,170
is actually broken down and is that

125
00:04:11,170 --> 00:04:15,160
addressable so it<font color="#E5E5E5"> is an indexable kind</font>

126
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:17,380
of URL if you will so even though

127
00:04:17,380 --> 00:04:18,760
there's a consumer front in this flash

128
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:21,010
base the entire back end of our platform

129
00:04:21,010 --> 00:04:24,220
allows for<font color="#CCCCCC"> the push to all the other</font>

130
00:04:24,220 --> 00:04:25,810
platforms as well literally all the way

131
00:04:25,810 --> 00:04:26,639
to the live broad

132
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:28,199
asked if we want so it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> a very flexible</font>

133
00:04:28,199 --> 00:04:31,080
dynamic system and will support those

134
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:32,999
particular pieces again<font color="#CCCCCC"> our focus was</font>

135
00:04:32,999 --> 00:04:35,490
simply on getting the social context out

136
00:04:35,490 --> 00:04:37,169
because that's really where social

137
00:04:37,169 --> 00:04:38,879
context meets the archive is how the

138
00:04:38,879 --> 00:04:40,199
rights<font color="#E5E5E5"> and the value is starting to</font>

139
00:04:40,199 --> 00:04:41,370
really develop out of<font color="#CCCCCC"> these collections</font>

140
00:04:41,370 --> 00:04:43,979
so Greg you are not a TV<font color="#CCCCCC"> network you're</font>

141
00:04:43,979 --> 00:04:46,199
not<font color="#E5E5E5"> even a for-profit company what's the</font>

142
00:04:46,199 --> 00:04:48,270
whole point of the NCAA taking all this

143
00:04:48,270 --> 00:04:50,249
footage turning into a site and hoping

144
00:04:50,249 --> 00:04:52,289
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> people would go there sure a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> couple</font>

145
00:04:52,289 --> 00:04:54,180
things number one is we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> trying to</font>

146
00:04:54,180 --> 00:04:56,430
provide value back to the site of

147
00:04:56,430 --> 00:04:58,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">ncaa.com and the rights holder in that</font>

148
00:04:58,620 --> 00:05:00,240
case which is CBS CBS has the

149
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:01,620
opportunity<font color="#E5E5E5"> but working</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with them</font>

150
00:05:01,620 --> 00:05:03,029
they're the ones that are<font color="#E5E5E5"> physically</font>

151
00:05:03,029 --> 00:05:05,310
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> out and selling the NCA</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> bolt</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so in</font>

152
00:05:05,310 --> 00:05:06,960
conjunction with thought equity what

153
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:09,240
we're providing is a unique asset for

154
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:12,050
NCAA com to hopefully help CBS and

155
00:05:12,050 --> 00:05:14,310
continue<font color="#E5E5E5"> to drive the value of the site</font>

156
00:05:14,310 --> 00:05:16,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">the same time also trying to open up the</font>

163
00:05:27,659 --> 00:05:29,310
it's a great way to promote the game so

164
00:05:29,310 --> 00:05:30,719
you talk of this is kind of a<font color="#E5E5E5"> pilot</font>

165

project what makes<font color="#E5E5E5"> you happy what's a</font>

166
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:34,800
successful pilot for you in terms of

readers or viewers or video streamed or

168
00:05:37,469 --> 00:05:39,810
something like that sure last March NCAA

169
00:05:39,810 --> 00:05:41,789
com had about 15 million unique visitors

170
00:05:41,789 --> 00:05:43,319
and that takes into account March

174
00:05:50,339 --> 00:05:53,789
tournament we for success for this would

175
00:05:53,789 --> 00:05:54,839
look to have somewhere between the

176
00:05:54,839 --> 00:05:56,520
million<font color="#E5E5E5"> and the million five range for</font>

177
00:05:56,520 --> 00:05:58,110
the NCAA of all along so about ten to

178
00:05:58,110 --> 00:06:00,060
fifteen percent of that traffic for just
