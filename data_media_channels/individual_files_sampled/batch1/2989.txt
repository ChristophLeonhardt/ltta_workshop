he's threatening to effectively change the First Amendment he's obviously got CNN it cites he worried about that at all not no I don't think that's a serious thing I we should all worried if anybody's going to change the First Amendment and remember the Democratic Party had a campaign plank to change the First Amendment and they were doing it in the guise of campaign finance reform and that was worrying me more because the press tends to miss that because they tend to lean that way and therefore they were supporting what they were viewing I think overly charitably as something in cleaning up money in politics when in fact what it would do is restrained multiple voices and so I thought the threat to the First Amendment came from the Democratic side more I think there's not going to be a serious effort on the Republican side
