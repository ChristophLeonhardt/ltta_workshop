the UN Human Rights Council chief was unequivocal in his condemnation of Israel's treatment of Palestinians in Gaza Israel as an occupying power under international law is obligated to protect the position of Gaza and ensure their welfare but they are in essence caged in a toxic slum from birth to death deprived of dignity dehumanized by the Israeli authorities to such a point it appears officials do not even consider that these men and women have a right as well as every reason to protest Israel's ambassadors that the special session was politically motivated we don't see the people of Gaza is our enemies and Israel deeply regrets any civilian loss of life Israel unilaterally disengaged from Gaza in summer 2005 there is no occupation in Gaza it is a myth but the unfortunate outcome of Monday's riots can only be attributed to Hamas cynical exploitation of its own population in a violent campaign against Israel it is regrettable that so many member states allowed himself to be misled by the false narrative of so-called peaceful protests the UN Special Rapporteur on Palestine reminded the meeting of a warning Israeli army commanders were given last month before the killings on Monday I must point out that the willful killing and the willful causing a great suffering or serious injury to body or health of civilians is both a grave breach of the Geneva Conventions and a war crime under the Rome Statute I note that the chief prosecutor of the International Criminal Court has issued a caution regarding the violence against civilians in Gaza last month the Palestinians don't believe they can rely on the US any longer to put any pressure on Israel so they're turning to international institutions for help they hope an investigation or fact-finding mission will expose Israel's tactics in Gaza to more international scrutiny Bernard Smith al-jazeera Ramallah
