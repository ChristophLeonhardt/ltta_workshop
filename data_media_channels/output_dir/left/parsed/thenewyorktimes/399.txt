New South Wales and its capital
of Sydney have about 100 ocean
baths and rock pools,
the most anywhere in the world.
These pools are public bathing
areas filled with sea water and
often carved out of cliffs and rocks.
Some are more than 100 years old.
Now a popular destination year round,
the pools have a history of segregation.
Most of them were built
exclusively for men.
Women and aborigines had to
fight to gain access to swim in
these pools in the
early and mid-1900s.
Today the cliffs surrounding pools like
Bogey Hole in Newcastle and Giles Baths
at Coogee beach have become unstable
due to erosion and weathering.
The Bogey Hole pool was
temporarily closed in 2015
because of safety concerns.
Thousands petitioned the city
and it was reopened in 2016
after steps were taken to
stabilize the cliffs.
Authorities say permanently
restricting the site is not an
option given the heritage and popularity
of Sydney's original infinity pools.
