Oh<font color="#CCCCCC"> big theater it's who who can yell</font>

00:00:05,549 --> 00:00:08,010
louder not who's yelling what you want

4
00:00:08,010 --> 00:00:09,330
here there's a very<font color="#CCCCCC"> big difference</font>

5
00:00:09,330 --> 00:00:11,670
between people who are presidential at

6
00:00:11,670 --> 00:00:14,750
people who are celebrity material was it

00:00:14,750 --> 00:00:23,420
everything<font color="#CCCCCC"> um yeah everything lately I</font>

8
00:00:23,420 --> 00:00:28,140
think I think the decisions that the

9
00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:30,300
American president makes impacts all of

heavily on<font color="#E5E5E5"> US leadership and that's why</font>

13
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:38,870
the election is so important

14
00:00:38,870 --> 00:00:41,520
<font color="#CCCCCC">unfortunately</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Columbia does everything</font>

16
00:00:45,030 --> 00:00:46,800
government does have certain influence

21
00:00:55,170 --> 00:00:57,329
president has a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit less power</font>

22
00:00:57,329 --> 00:01:00,270
than a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> people might attribute to</font>

him the local government has more of an

00:01:03,539 --> 00:01:06,150
impact than the national government the

25
00:01:06,150 --> 00:01:08,610
American president has no influence in

26
00:01:08,610 --> 00:01:10,110
my life I<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't give a about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

27
00:01:10,110 --> 00:01:12,799
country if we look at what's been

28
00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:15,900
consistent about our last presidents

29
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:18,630
every single one of them have had some

30
00:01:18,630 --> 00:01:22,320
level of charisma you need a<font color="#E5E5E5"> very good</font>

31
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:23,939
personality you need a<font color="#E5E5E5"> very good guy</font>

32
00:01:23,939 --> 00:01:25,320
writing your speech behind you

33
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:27,270
personalities the first thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

34
00:01:27,270 --> 00:01:29,640
people judge others on<font color="#CCCCCC"> president obama</font>

00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:31,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">has done a fairly good job with being a</font>

36
00:01:31,650 --> 00:01:33,630
very eloquent speaker and I feel like

37
00:01:33,630 --> 00:01:36,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">that is a very key ingredient to being a</font>

38
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:39,140
good leader to win an American election

39
00:01:39,140 --> 00:01:41,939
money is definitely a factor money is a

40
00:01:41,939 --> 00:01:44,740
really big deal especially

41
00:01:44,740 --> 00:01:47,110
the Supreme<font color="#E5E5E5"> Court has knocked down a lot</font>

42
00:01:47,110 --> 00:01:48,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">of restrictions on money at election</font>

43
00:01:48,790 --> 00:01:51,340
campaigns the whole saying of one dollar

44
00:01:51,340 --> 00:01:53,860
equals one vote might be funny but it's

45
00:01:53,860 --> 00:01:56,560
it's true it's a reality I do think that

46
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:59,140
money plays an outsized role in American

47
00:01:59,140 --> 00:02:02,380
politics as much as he plays an outsized

48
00:02:02,380 --> 00:02:04,509
role in every political system in the

49
00:02:04,509 --> 00:02:07,179
world now is Hillary Clinton running for

50
00:02:07,179 --> 00:02:08,380
president there's a potential to break

51
00:02:08,380 --> 00:02:10,209
the gender barrier I think they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> ready</font>

52
00:02:10,209 --> 00:02:12,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">I don't know even the one to admit to it</font>

53
00:02:12,250 --> 00:02:14,769
I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> we're already a long time ago</font>

54
00:02:14,769 --> 00:02:16,599
for a female president and if it<font color="#E5E5E5"> has</font>

55
00:02:16,599 --> 00:02:18,250
happened<font color="#CCCCCC"> in Latin America why wouldn't</font>

56
00:02:18,250 --> 00:02:20,530
it happen in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> US every country is</font>

57
00:02:20,530 --> 00:02:22,420
ready for a female<font color="#CCCCCC"> heresy I think the</font>

58
00:02:22,420 --> 00:02:24,790
question of is the<font color="#E5E5E5"> u.s. ready for a</font>

59
00:02:24,790 --> 00:02:26,799
female head of state is an insane

60
00:02:26,799 --> 00:02:28,780
question they're supposed to be one of

61
00:02:28,780 --> 00:02:30,100
<font color="#CCCCCC">the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> most developed</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> countries in the</font>

62
00:02:30,100 --> 00:02:32,019
world I don't think<font color="#CCCCCC"> it should be whether</font>

63
00:02:32,019 --> 00:02:34,720
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> US</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is ready for a female president</font>

64
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:37,330
but it should be<font color="#E5E5E5"> really are we ready for</font>

65
00:02:37,330 --> 00:02:41,049
<font color="#CCCCCC">a diverse set of views and opinions I</font>

66
00:02:41,049 --> 00:02:44,170
think there'd be certain religions that

67
00:02:44,170 --> 00:02:46,150
in certain sexuality is that perhaps

68
00:02:46,150 --> 00:02:49,239
America would not as a whole be able to

69
00:02:49,239 --> 00:02:51,370
accept people are pretty much willing to

70
00:02:51,370 --> 00:02:53,470
accept anything for an atheist<font color="#E5E5E5"> president</font>

71
00:02:53,470 --> 00:02:56,290
I think American people would not

72
00:02:56,290 --> 00:03:00,370
support a president that is Muslim I

73
00:03:00,370 --> 00:03:02,620
think it would<font color="#CCCCCC"> be difficult for someone</font>

74
00:03:02,620 --> 00:03:04,900
who wasn't married or someone who didn't

75
00:03:04,900 --> 00:03:06,880
have children I think in a sense

76
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:10,510
humanizes a candidate America has a long

77
00:03:10,510 --> 00:03:12,760
way to go when it comes to sexual

78
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:15,030
preference I would like<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> see a</font>

79
00:03:15,030 --> 00:03:18,160
transgender single father as president I

80
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:20,680
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that biggest challenge that the</font>

81
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:22,569
next president will face on the first

82
00:03:22,569 --> 00:03:22,920
day

83
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:25,880
he's to give us some hot rod<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

84
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:28,500
material life<font color="#E5E5E5"> and health the biggest</font>

85
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:30,150
<font color="#CCCCCC">problem is the president's gonna face</font>

86
00:03:30,150 --> 00:03:31,380
day one is just trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to please</font>

87
00:03:31,380 --> 00:03:33,540
everybody whoever<font color="#E5E5E5"> is elected in office</font>

88
00:03:33,540 --> 00:03:36,000
their<font color="#E5E5E5"> biggest problem is how am I going</font>

89
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,430
to unite people who have grown so far

90
00:03:38,430 --> 00:03:40,290
apart that they don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> even talk the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> same</font>

91
00:03:40,290 --> 00:03:43,290
language anymore it's such a complicated

92
00:03:43,290 --> 00:03:47,010
country and it just yeah I would I

93
00:03:47,010 --> 00:03:49,319
wouldn't want to be in<font color="#E5E5E5"> his shoes for</font>

94
00:03:49,319 --> 00:00:00,000
sure no
