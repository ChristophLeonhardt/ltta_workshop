what matters most with urination is
ultimately the color of your urine the
frequency isn't as important water down
lemonade is good
anything darker than that is starting to
get into dehydration you don't want your
urine to be the color of water either
because then that means that you're
getting too much water remember your
body is smart so your body needs a
certain amount and it's not the more the
better one misconception people have
about nutrition in general is that the
more the better and that's why people
are taking supplements and they think
well if I can have this much vitamin C
why not get this much vitamin C and
that's not how it works your body needs
what it needs and anything extra gets
filtered out
