wouldn't you say there's a pretty wide consensus that it was Parmar behind this and you know this was part of the Kellis Tanny extremist movement that brought this plane down but even though in Canada I don't you think it's unfair to a person who has never been charged never been put to stand never been questioned never been cross-examined and terror Canada I was trying to do close this file under his name in 1985 the single biggest act of terrorism to at least begin on Canadian soil was the bombing of Air India flight 182 that departed from Vancouver 329 people lost their lives on that flight now the mastermind behind the bombing is a callous tani extremists by the name of telander Singh Parmar but not everybody buys that just like 9/11 there are conspiracy theories and even though the real memorial is to take place tomorrow on the actual anniversary of the bombing here today a group has gathered at the Air India memorial in Toronto to pay their respects but it's with a bit of a weird twist the people here aren't buying the official explanation and the official reasons it's almost as though 9/11 deniers are showing up on September 10th at the 9/11 memorial to give their showing of respect we're gonna try to talk to some of the organizers here and find out what they have to say about flight 182 all these decades later I'm just trying to understand they're the official memorial services are tomorrow yeah what is the purpose of this service here today sir well it's the same purpose that purpose for tomorrow service we only try to avoid to upset anybody because that's not the purpose of this memorial to upset anybody so we've done it differently so they could if they accept us we will join them as of next and I mean is there some dissension between various factions that you wouldn't be part of the main memorial that's not what it is it's been a very negative press for last 30 32 years and obviously you know in the absence of the inquiry a lot of finger-pointing has been done and we didn't want it to get involved in any mudslinging so therefore we wanted to register that we to mourn the loss of life just so I understand do you have a alternative theory of who is behind the Air India bombing I mean it's been said the mastermind was tell Wender Parmar is that correct well I don't know who the mastermind is that Linda Tamar was never put to to through the trial he would never cross examined I don't want it to join anybody who would say that our Justice John Major's inquiry was very limited the mandate was very narrow so therefore I would like to see inquiry from A to Z to find out where all this idea conspired and and who helped who and who did who in and obviously it's not one-man job if it's more than one man job then who is because no one in Canada has been convicted but do you think there is some sort of a conspiracy I mean there's one theory is that the government of India was actually behind the bombing is that something that you're putting forth here but if I if I believed the journalist from Globe and Mail and Toronto Star that is the theory but I guess the government has not paid any attention to that theory that was published in the book soft target so I don't want to promote any theory but I what I what I wanted to do is why we afraid to have a commission so we could find out exactly what happened but I mean it seems like a preposterous theory though I mean the idea that the government of India would kill its own citizens and a commercial aircraft I mean what would be the motive for that well who would who would politically benefit from it and who's been politically suffering from it I mean that's one thing would give you that idea that who could do it I mean who would this kind of tragedy serve the purpose to I mean you know there are families who suffered a lot from this tragedy and were somebody who did it was thinking about them or they were thinking about their motive do you reject the theory that this was perpetrated by those who were callous Tanny extremists well I'm carless Danny and I'm not extremist and I believe in lobbying and that's exactly what I do and I know thousands of Carlos Donnie's in Canada who would do the same thing who sit beside the government and many other Canadian issues so the notion of being a extremist Khalistan II would do that I don't think this will this would ever serve the purpose of a Khalistan movement at all but doesn't the evidence point towards that I mean given the political climate at the time in India and what happened later with the assassination of Indira Gandhi what we never we actually never in Canada try to find out what happened so until we do that perceptions our perceptions of perception of in our law wrong anytime there's a tragedy 9/11 happened government of America never rested until they find the perpetrator and punish them why the Government of Canada playing playing politics with it until 2007 they didn't own this tragedy they didn't think it was a Canadian tragedy week as a Canadian six are suffering and stigmatize from them you could see I want to mourn and families are upset why I'm doing this so you know you gotta understand behind the scene there's a some sort of notion promoting there was a the six who did it those six who promote Holliston did it no sex who promote Khalistan are peace-loving six and we are the one of those I mean you mentioned earlier though there was an inquiry in Canada John Major and but you were saying it was too limited in its scope well Justice John Major's and Cory was that what elapsed and our security that this kind of incident gone through our VA Shinra securities so the purpose of the inquiry was to find out where we need to plug in our security it wasn't to find out who who conspired it who did it you know why there are so many questions unanswered even today but wouldn't you say there's a pretty wide consensus that it was Parmar behind this and you know this was part of the callous Tanny extremist movement that brought this plane down but even though in Canada don't you think it's unfair to a person who has never been charged never been put to stand never been questioned never been cross-examined and terror Canada is trying to do close this file under his name if he is the one then find out do the Duden quarry find out and then then we will all understand if it was him I mean just saying it well were two journalists from Toronto Star and Global Mail of giving a different narrative of the entire who do we believe investigative journalists or politicians or someone I don't even know who but you know what you mentioned 9/11 and of course there's all kinds of conspiracy theories about 9/11 as well and I mean some people are saying that this is you know insensitive maybe even disrespectful that there'd be a gathering before the official memorial for Air India it'd be like the 9/11 truthers going on September 10th to have their memorial at the 9/11 memorial what would you say to that what I don't think so I take it very positively I think we came out very wholeheartedly our sole purpose was to register that we to mourn the loss of lives and just so our viewers at home understand the the whole council any movement that is for a seek independent homeland in India is that correct say yeah sick sick homeland in Punjab and and how active is that movement now well its international movement in itself everywhere I think the six had ruled before that part of the world and in 1947 when the British left that part of the world they decided to hand over our piece of land to do India so now we think that partnership is no longer working so therefore there they're asking for independence sir where do you stand on this I mean there seems to be this fringe out there that subscribes to some kind of conspiracy theory about the Air India bombing like I said we were here just 24 hours ago to see a separate remembrance ceremony by people some of whom identified as pro calles Annie what do you make of us it could be a political thing you know people can twist it either way for their own advantage so I'm not a guy who can investigate and go through and finalize or decide for me the life been lost it was a terror attack for sure Canadians lost their life and that's the last thing we want to see further as we go do you think it was somewhat disrespectful of people to come here yesterday to have their separate remembrance ceremony and sort of you know insinuate that the real truth is not out there and you know more or less hijack the the remembrance of the area India 182 victims because these names are here those are all innocent people right so they just want to hide this crime my opinion I see it as the same sort of thing were these callous tiny fix they basically blame other people or like the Indian government or they said that Indian intelligence and the purpose is well I mean to deflect attention away from who really perpetrated these horrible atrocities politicians here have to understand this that they have to keep Canada safe United a country for everyone where they feel comfortable they feel saved they can raise their families and other politics of you know any other players they should not bring it here you you
