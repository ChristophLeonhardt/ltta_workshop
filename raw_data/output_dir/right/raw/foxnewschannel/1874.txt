BENJAMIN HALL REPORTING LIVE.

7
00:00:07,343 --> 00:00:08,144
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

8
00:00:08,144 --> 00:00:11,147
REACTION TO THE OUTBREAK OF

9
00:00:11,147 --> 00:00:12,548
HOSTILITY, IT HAS BEEN SWIFT.

10
00:00:12,548 --> 00:00:13,850
AMID FEARS THAT IRAN WILL RAMP

11
00:00:13,850 --> 00:00:17,320
UP ITS NUCLEAR AMBITIONS.

12
00:00:17,320 --> 00:00:18,654
>> IF THAT HAPPENS, YOU COULD

13
00:00:18,654 --> 00:00:20,857
HAVE A DRAMATIC ESCALATION OF

14
00:00:20,857 --> 00:00:24,727
CONFLICT IN THE MIDDLE EAST.

15
00:00:24,727 --> 00:00:26,963
TO THE POINT THAT IT WOULD

16
00:00:26,963 --> 00:00:27,630
REALLY RAISE CONCERNS ABOUT

17
00:00:27,630 --> 00:00:32,301
WHETHER OR NOT WE COULD CONTAIN

18
00:00:32,301 --> 00:00:33,102
FAT CONFLICT OR WHETHER WE ARE

19
00:00:33,102 --> 00:00:36,139
ON THE PRECIPICE OF A WORLD WAR.

>> GOOD TO SEE YOU, SHANNON.

26
00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:45,214
>> Shannon: THE SYRIAN WAR HAS

27
00:00:45,214 --> 00:00:46,816
OPENED UP AN OPPORTUNITY FOR

28
00:00:46,816 --> 00:00:48,684
IRAN TO MOVE FACILITIES, PEOPLE,

29
00:00:48,684 --> 00:00:51,320
EVEN WEAPONRY INTO SYRIA, GIVING

30
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:53,990
IT A MUCH CLEANER SHOT AT

31
00:00:53,990 --> 00:00:54,357
ISRAEL.

32
00:00:54,357 --> 00:00:55,525
BENJAMIN NETANYAHU SAYS WE WILL

33
00:00:55,525 --> 00:00:57,326
NOT STAND FOR THIS.

34
00:00:57,326 --> 00:00:58,494
"THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY

35
00:00:58,494 --> 00:01:00,163
MUST PREVENT THE ENTRENCHMENT OF

36
00:01:00,163 --> 00:01:03,499
THE FORCE IN SYRIA, IRAN CROSSED

37
00:01:03,499 --> 00:01:05,134
A REDLINE AND WE RESPONDED

38
00:01:05,134 --> 00:01:05,601
PROPORTIONALLY."

39
00:01:05,601 --> 00:01:06,936
HOW BIG IS THE PROBLEM?

40
00:01:06,936 --> 00:01:08,404
SPEAK OF THE PROBLEM IS HUGE.

41
00:01:08,404 --> 00:01:10,773
WITH THE IRANIANS HAVE DONE,

42
00:01:10,773 --> 00:01:12,141
SIRI REPRESENTS A STRATEGIC FOR

43
00:01:12,141 --> 00:01:12,542
THEM.

44
00:01:12,542 --> 00:01:14,110
EVERY SINGLE YEAR SINCE THE

45
00:01:14,110 --> 00:01:15,344
ISLAMIC REPUBLIC OF IRAN WAS

46
00:01:15,344 --> 00:01:17,914
FORMED IN 1980, THEY SAID THAT

47
00:01:17,914 --> 00:01:19,248
THEY INTEND AS A STRATEGIC

48
00:01:19,248 --> 00:01:19,949
OBJECTIVE TO DESTROY THE STATE

49
00:01:19,949 --> 00:01:20,716
OF ISRAEL.

50
00:01:20,716 --> 00:01:23,920
THEY HAVE 130,000 MISSILES AND

51
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:24,587
ROCKETS IN HEZBOLLAH'S HANDS

52
00:01:24,587 --> 00:01:26,122
RIGHT NOW AND LET GO MY LEBANON.

53
00:01:26,122 --> 00:01:29,492
WHAT THEY ARE TRYING TO DO IS

54
00:01:29,492 --> 00:01:30,927
REPLICATE THAT IN SOUTHERN SYRIA

55
00:01:30,927 --> 00:01:31,627
WITH TENS OF THOUSANDS OF

56
00:01:31,627 --> 00:01:31,961
ROCKETS.

57
00:01:31,961 --> 00:01:34,597
THEY ALREADY BROUGHT IN TO PROP

58
00:01:34,597 --> 00:01:36,365
UP THE ASSAD REGIME TENS OF

59
00:01:36,365 --> 00:01:37,500
THOUSANDS OF THEIR PROXIES.

60
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:39,502
THAT IS WHY WE SQUANDER THE

61
00:01:39,502 --> 00:01:40,369
OPPORTUNITIES TO PUSH BACK ON

62
00:01:40,369 --> 00:01:42,939
THERE'S A NUMBER OF YEARS AGO

63
00:01:42,939 --> 00:01:43,673
DURING THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION.

64
00:01:43,673 --> 00:01:45,575
IT HAS BROUGHT US TO THIS

65
00:01:45,575 --> 00:01:47,643
PROBLEM, WHERE OUR CLOSE ALLY IN

66
00:01:47,643 --> 00:01:50,313
THE REGION IS BEING THREATENED.

67
00:01:50,313 --> 00:01:52,348
IT'S VERY SOVEREIGNTY IS BEING

68
00:01:52,348 --> 00:01:53,015
THREATENED BY THE IRANIANS.

69
00:01:53,015 --> 00:01:55,918
WHERE ARE WE HEADING WITH HIS?

70
00:01:55,918 --> 00:01:56,652
THE ATTACK THAT THE IRANIAN

71
00:01:56,652 --> 00:02:02,358
SLIDE WAS DONE BY A HEAD OF THE

72
00:02:02,358 --> 00:02:03,459
FOREST, WORKED FOR A KNOWN

73
00:02:03,459 --> 00:02:05,695
MILITARY LEADER, WORKS FOR THE

74
00:02:05,695 --> 00:02:06,295
SUPREME LEADER.

75
00:02:06,295 --> 00:02:07,763
A COMBINATION OF THE CIA AND

76
00:02:07,763 --> 00:02:09,931
SPECIAL OPERATION FORCES.

77
00:02:09,931 --> 00:02:12,068
SO THIS IS A CALCULATED MOVE ON

78
00:02:12,068 --> 00:02:14,937
THEIR PART TO REALLY ENCROACH ON

79
00:02:14,937 --> 00:02:15,771
ISRAEL.

80
00:02:15,771 --> 00:02:17,306
ISRAEL HAS DRAWN A REDLINE,

81
00:02:17,306 --> 00:02:17,707
SHANNON.

82
00:02:17,707 --> 00:02:18,474
THEY WILL GO AFTER THEM.

83
00:02:18,474 --> 00:02:21,177
THEY CANNOT AFFORD TO LET THEM

84
00:02:21,177 --> 00:02:24,580
RAIN MISSILES AND ROCKETS ON

85
00:02:24,580 --> 00:02:25,815
TEL AVIV AND JERUSALEM FROM

86
00:02:25,815 --> 00:02:27,717
MULTIPLE LOCATIONS, WHICH WOULD

87
00:02:27,717 --> 00:02:28,718
OVERWHELM THEIR DEFENSES.

88
00:02:28,718 --> 00:02:31,120
IF THAT HAPPENS, WE WOULD HAVE A

89
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:33,522
WAR WITH ISRAEL AND LEBANON AND

90
00:02:33,522 --> 00:02:33,990
ALSO WITH IRAN.

91
00:02:33,990 --> 00:02:41,230
THERE IS A PATH HERE WHERE WAR

92
00:02:41,230 --> 00:02:41,964
COULD BREAK OUT WITH ISRAEL AND

93
00:02:41,964 --> 00:02:42,698
LEBANON AND IRANIANS, FOR SURE.

94
00:02:42,698 --> 00:02:43,332
>> Shannon: WHAT SHOULD WE

95
00:02:43,332 --> 00:02:43,766
MAKE OF THIS?

96
00:02:43,766 --> 00:02:45,334
IRAN'S PRESIDENT HAS -- WE THINK

97
00:02:45,334 --> 00:02:47,837
OF IT IN TERMS OF THE AYATOLLAH

98
00:02:47,837 --> 00:02:49,939
CALLING THE SHOTS, THE SUPREME

99
00:02:49,939 --> 00:02:51,107
LEADER, BUT HASSAN ROUHANI SAYS

100
00:02:51,107 --> 00:02:52,708
THIS, HE'S TALKED TO THE GERMAN

101
00:02:52,708 --> 00:02:53,843
CHANCELLOR ANGELA MERKEL, SAYING

102
00:02:53,843 --> 00:02:55,711
HE DOES NOT WANT TO NEW

103
00:02:55,711 --> 00:02:56,112
TENSIONS.

104
00:02:56,112 --> 00:02:57,580
"IRAN HAS ALWAYS SOUGHT TO

105
00:02:57,580 --> 00:02:59,749
REDUCE TENSIONS IN THE REGION,

106
00:02:59,749 --> 00:03:01,150
TRYING TO STRENGTHEN SECURITY

107
00:03:01,150 --> 00:03:01,584
AND STABILITY.

108
00:03:01,584 --> 00:03:02,985
THAT'S ALLEGEDLY PART OF A PHONE

109
00:03:02,985 --> 00:03:04,120
CALL THOSE TWO GOUDA.

110
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:06,355
>> THAT IS A BOLDFACE LIE.

111
00:03:06,355 --> 00:03:07,523
THE FACTS DON'T SUPPORT ANY OF

112
00:03:07,523 --> 00:03:10,059
THAT WHATSOEVER.

113
00:03:10,059 --> 00:03:11,894
THEY ARE NESTLING UP TO THE

114
00:03:11,894 --> 00:03:12,261
EUROPEANS.

115
00:03:12,261 --> 00:03:13,496
THE IRANIANS ARE NOT GOING TO

116
00:03:13,496 --> 00:03:14,530
PULL OUT OF THIS DEAL INITIALLY

117
00:03:14,530 --> 00:03:16,098
BECAUSE IT IS TO THEIR ECONOMIC

118
00:03:16,098 --> 00:03:17,300
BENEFIT TO STAY IN IT.

119
00:03:17,300 --> 00:03:19,068
THEY ARE GOING TO TAKE SANCTIONS

120
00:03:19,068 --> 00:03:20,836
FROM THE UNITED STATES AND I

121
00:03:20,836 --> 00:03:21,570
HOPE THEY ARE COMPREHENSIVE AS

122
00:03:21,570 --> 00:03:25,074
THEY POSSIBLY CAN BE, SECRETARY

123
00:03:25,074 --> 00:03:26,142
STEVE MNUCHIN SAID THEY WOULD

124
00:03:26,142 --> 00:03:27,343
BE.

125
00:03:27,343 --> 00:03:28,244
THEY DON'T WANT SANCTIONS FROM

126
00:03:28,244 --> 00:03:28,945
THE EUROPEANS.

127
00:03:28,945 --> 00:03:30,079
THAT IS WHY WHAT THEY WILL STAY

128
00:03:30,079 --> 00:03:32,114
IN A DEAL FOR THE NEAR TERM.

129
00:03:32,114 --> 00:03:33,215
I TRUST THAT OUR SANCTIONS ARE

130
00:03:33,215 --> 00:03:34,951
TOUGH AND I THINK THAT WE ALSO

131
00:03:34,951 --> 00:03:36,152
SHOULD BE SANCTIONING EUROPEAN

132
00:03:36,152 --> 00:03:37,520
COMPANIES THAT ARE DOING

133
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:38,354
BUSINESS WITH THEM.

134
00:03:38,354 --> 00:03:40,156
WE WORKED FOR MONTHS TO TRY TO

135
00:03:40,156 --> 00:03:41,424
BRING THE EUROPEANS AROUND.

136
00:03:41,424 --> 00:03:44,093
THEY AGREED ON A SECRET SITE

137
00:03:44,093 --> 00:03:45,161
PROBATION BEING REMOVED, THEY

138
00:03:45,161 --> 00:03:47,930
AGREED ON BALLISTIC MISSILES

139
00:03:47,930 --> 00:03:50,266
PROBATION BEING REMOVED, AND

140
00:03:50,266 --> 00:03:51,534
THAT BEING ADDED TO THE NUCLEAR

141
00:03:51,534 --> 00:03:52,134
DEAL.

142
00:03:52,134 --> 00:03:53,836
THEY DID NOT AGREE ON THE SUNSET

143
00:03:53,836 --> 00:03:55,504
CLAUSE AS BEING REMOVED AND THAT

144
00:03:55,504 --> 00:03:57,506
MEANS THAT IRAN HAS A PATHWAY TO

145
00:03:57,506 --> 00:03:58,174
A NUCLEAR WEAPON.

146
00:03:58,174 --> 00:04:00,509
WHY DIDN'T THEY AGREE TO THAT?

147
00:04:00,509 --> 00:04:01,844
BECAUSE THEY KNEW THE IRANIANS

148
00:04:01,844 --> 00:04:03,713
WOULD BULK AND AS A RESULT OF

149
00:04:03,713 --> 00:04:05,715
THAT, SANCTIONS WOULD HAVE TO BE

150
00:04:05,715 --> 00:04:06,482
IMPOSED BECAUSE THE IRANIANS

151
00:04:06,482 --> 00:04:07,750
WOULD PULL OUT OF THE DEAL AND

152
00:04:07,750 --> 00:04:09,185
THEY DON'T WANT TO LOSE THE

153
00:04:09,185 --> 00:04:10,419
FINANCIAL INTEREST THAT THEY

154
00:04:10,419 --> 00:04:11,220
HAVE IN IRAN RIGHT NOW.

155
00:04:11,220 --> 00:04:14,924
THAT IS THE DIRTY LITTLE SECRET

156
00:04:14,924 --> 00:04:15,725
THAT WE HAVE.

157
00:04:15,725 --> 00:04:17,927
NOTICE THAT OUR SUNNI ARAB

158
00:04:17,927 --> 00:04:19,362
ALLIES IN ISRAEL ARE ALL FOR THE

159
00:04:19,362 --> 00:04:20,930
DECISION OF THE PRESIDENT MADE.

160
00:04:20,930 --> 00:04:22,932
THEY BELIEVE THAT THAT DECISION

161
00:04:22,932 --> 00:04:24,333
ENHANCES THEIR SECURITY.

162
00:04:24,333 --> 00:04:26,602
IT DOESN'T DO WHAT SECRETARY

00:04:26,602 --> 00:04:28,371
LEON PANETTA IS SUGGESTING, ON

THE CUSP OF POSSIBLY WORLD WAR

III.

166
00:04:29,672 --> 00:04:32,708
