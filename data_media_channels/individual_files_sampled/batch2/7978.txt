IT IS A CRAZY DAY IN AMERICA WHERE I AM ABOUT TO COMMEND RALPH PETERS. I HAVE DONE MANY STORIES ON RALPH PETERS, HE IS A SO-CALLED STRATEGIC ANALYST FOR FOX NEWS. I BELIEVE HE IS VERY PRO-WAR. LATELY HE HAS BEEN A LITTLE SURPRISING ON THE ISSUE OF AR 15. HE THOUGHT IT WAS CRAZY FOR THEM TO BE IN CIVILIAN HANDS. ON THE ISSUE OF DONALD TRUMP AND RUSSIA, RALPH PETERS APPARENTLY HAS HAD ENOUGH. HE IS QUITTING FOX NEWS AND VERY PUBLICLY SO. BUZZ FEED GOT A HOLD OF HIS EMAIL THAT HE SENT TO PEOPLE THAT HE WORKED WITH AT FOX NEWS AND IT IS SCATHING. LET'S LISTEN TO WHAT PETERS HAD TO SAY. SHOTS FIRED. WELL, PETERS IS NOT HOLDING BACK. I TORE INTO RALPH PETERS ON MANY OCCASIONS. DON'T GET ME WRONG I DON'T AGREE WITH HIM ON MANY ISSUES BUT I DO HAVE TO COMMEND HIM FOR AT LEAST BEING CONSISTENT. I HOPE MSNBC DOESN'T HIRE HIM BECAUSE HE IS INCREDIBLY HAWKISH AND PRO-WAR. HE'S GOING TO HAVE A HARD TIME GETTING HIRED ANOTHER PLACES BUT HE TOOK THAT KIND OF RISK SO THAT IS SOMETHING THAT IS WORTH POINTING OUT. HE IS NOT ANYWHERE NEAR DONE. HE SAID THE GUYS AT FOXBUSINESS ARE WAY BETTER THAN THE PEOPLE IN FOX NEWS. THEN HE WENT BACK TO EXPLAINING WHAT THE REAL ISSUE WAS. THE PRIMETIME HOST HE IS REFERRING TO IS CLEARLY SEAN HANNITY, TUCKER CARLSON, LAURA INGRAM. WHEN HE IS SAYING IS I CAN'T BELIEVE IT IS CONSERVATIVES WHO HAVE TURNED ON LAW ENFORCEMENT WHICH IS SOMETHING I HAVE BEEN SAYING. THESE GUYS PRETEND TO BE FOR THE RULE OF LAW NOW FOR THE DESTRUCTION OF THE RULE OF LAW. THEY ARE THINLY DISGUISED ñ THEY ARE OBVIOUSLY NOT CUTTING FOR ANYONE WITH JUST A MODERATE RATIONALITY. THEY ARE CONCERNED ABOUT LIES. REMEMBER THAT INVESTIGATION MCCABE WANTED TO BE TOUGHER ON HILLARY CLINTON. GUYS LIKE RALPH PETERS LOOK AT THAT AND THINK REALLY THAT IS WHY YOU FIRED HIM? NO IT'S BECAUSE HE MIGHT BE A WITNESS IN YOUR CASE. JUDGE NAPOLITANO IS NOW SAYING SIMILAR THINGS. BUT THEY ARE ONLY ALLOWED IN DRIBS AND DRABS. AT THE END OF THE LETTER ñ OF ALL PEOPLE TO BE PRINCIPLED IN AMERICA, RALPH PETERS, WOW. IN THIS CASE IT IS NOT POLITICS THAT MAKE STRANGE BEDFELLOWS, IT IS PRINCIPAL. AND A STUNNING TURN OF EVENTS I WOULD NEVER HAVE EXPECTED, I'M TELLING YOU NOW I'M COMMENDING RALPH PETERS FOR BEING A MAN I ENORMOUSLY DISAGREE WITH BUT AT LEAST A MAN OF PRINCIPLE ON AN IMPORTANT ISSUE LIKE THIS.
