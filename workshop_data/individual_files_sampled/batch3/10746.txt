hello and welcome to crosstalk where all things are considered I'm Peter Lavelle on this edition of crosstalk we consider one question is Donald Trump's America first policy in contradiction to the Washington Consensus idea of American exceptionalism the answer this question will likely define Trump's presidency and changed the world in the process crosstalking American exceptionalism I'm joined by my guest Michael Flanagan in Washington he is president of Flanagan consulting and a former congressman in Charlotte so we have David Swanson he is the director of world beyond Ward dot-org and in Northwood we cross to interject Paul Maher he is a professor of international politics at City University London all right gentlemen crosstalk rules in effect that means he can jump in anytime you want and I always appreciate it let me go to David first because he's written a book on the topic titled curing exceptionalism okay we have about a year and a half of this presidency I'm getting a pretty good idea what America first means in the mind of Donald Trump and I know very well what American exceptionalism is and I'm not a big proponent of it art is Donald Trump incompatible with his American first policies with Washington's insistence Grudge and digging their heels in very deep that American exceptionalism must be maintained go ahead David in Charlottesville I guess the short answer is no I don't see it I look at what Donald Trump does in terms of foreign policy in terms of continuing US imperialism and he is dropping more bombs he is building more bases he is getting more military spending out of Congress demanding more military spending out of Europe shipping weapons to more places including Ukraine continuing to insist on the US right to do what it wants in places like Ukraine and Nicaragua and around the world he's not switching policies allowing the people of Afghanistan or Nicaragua or anywhere else to decide their own fate I mean the changes are all rhetorical and and in terms of mannerisms and style people in manok people abroad outside the United States who see him as radically different because he blurts out things he doesn't act on like NATO is obsolete seems to me as as superficial as people within the United States who say the the people that are the vote in Crimea to rejoin Russia was the big threat to peace and stability and the rule of of the past centuries you know I looking at actions rather than at-at statements I don't see it he is continuing US policy good points made there Michael nonetheless and we we have the reaction of where you are this the epicenter of the swamp they see Trump is being very much a threat to the outlook that has been cultivated and enforced I would point out since the end of the second world war particularly since the end of the Cold War so I mean Michael is right on all these points here but that's not how the people that used to run the show see it that way and they're pushing back against them and very in very severe very peculiar ways and and in particularly using the the media to push against him go ahead Michael yeah I think the swamp has a collectivist view definitely denies American exceptionalism writ small and that is America has the best workers in the world and we have an exceptional view of our future and we are we view ourselves as as the shining light of the world and then you have exceptionalism writ large which as a matter of foreign policy means that will run the world the I think writ small Trump is a huge champion of that writ large I think your other guest is correct is he's not he's not a big champion of America run the world in the sense that we will make foreign policy for the world but we will behave any way we need to to protect our security and that that is often irrespective of what Nicaragua wants or what what anybody else wants and I think Trump is definitely a proponent of that the swamp would rather have us collectively sit with the European powers basically you know Europe almost exclusively and and discuss what we need to do around the world while we pay the freight and they make the decisions and I think Trump is trying to bring an end to that by threatening NATO not not as an institution like Eisenhower did by the way and his presidency yeah but to say that it's not an organization that we're going to support exclusively and move on forward with Entergy be you know combined what we've just heard from Michael and David so America first an American exceptionalism they've defined the worst possible elements of both and they're being combined that's what I've gotten from this conversation so far go ahead in Norwood Northwood I don't think I would violently disagree with my two colleagues that you've just spoken with I think American exceptionalism is a particular kind of nationalism and that nationalism has attached to it a great sense of a uniqueness and superiority and to a large degree it's also backed by power but its power behind certain kinds of values and I think where President Trump probably differs from his predecessors like President Obama and George W Bush as well is that in a way he's he's rejected the rhetoric of values of democracy of human rights and promoting those kinds of liberal values in favor of naked power so I would say that that's the principle difference between those two there is also a strategic disagreement as well and I think that largely is around the relationship that the United States or president Trump is building with Russia and the bigger geopolitical picture I think which he has in his mind possibly urged by Henry Kissinger the OMA Secretary of State about some kind of a possible Russian Chinese split and I think there's a big disagreement about that but that's a strategic question the overall the United States continues to exert its power but I think the rhetoric around values I think President Trump doesn't have any time for that he's much more about asserting the dollar of the other trade of market access and of the American military okay well David I mean I guess in a way Trump is probably more honest than his predecessors because he doesn't talk about democracy promotion as you know with that that has always been a cover I think only people in the swamp actually believe in that rhetoric any more forcefully bringing democracy to the world I don't see where it works no one's ever empirically proven it to me but but so really it's the same thing it's American exceptionalism with it just a different rhetoric I guess you know that makes a lot of sense go ahead David that's exactly right the rhetoric has changed a lot more than the substance you know the disagreement between the make America great again people and the America already is great people is not around the need for the United States to have double standards and a set of laws only for itself and superiority the rest of the world that is the universally agreed upon in Washington the disagreements are around rhetoric around domestic policies and around Russia and the demand from the from the Democrats I wouldn't dignify it by calling it strategic it's more trying to explain Hillary Clinton's loss and hating anything Trump does so if he threatens North Korea that's crazy if he fails to threaten Russia that's crazy you know that the disagreement is is around this this mythical story of evil deeds of Russia and their gargantuan significance in the in the context of the good us law-abiding behavior and and they're you know you can give Trump credit for refusing to bow to the Russia Gators otherwise I give him very little credit for anything thus far as he continues disastrous policies that are taking this country and the rest of the world over a cliff you know again but I read Erick is is certainly different but and some of the actions are to I mean I don't think any of us really took seriously that there would be a meeting with Kim so soon nothing much came of it and now he wants to meet with the Iranian leader days before in capital letters on Twitter threatening it I mean Michael how do you explain that or is that just expediency the midterms it's just the here and now and worry about the implications later because I mean from on the outside looking in this is very confusing and we're supposed to be experts to be able to figure this stuff out go ahead Michael yeah I think one of the hallmarks of Trump's foreign policy is that it's Trump it's it's not a collective view of the State Department and with weigh ins from DoD and other play and intelligence it's it's Trump its Annie's proven to be fairly adept at it so far however you may or may not like the outcomes he's gotten in with Korea he's reworked trade agreements in Europe and elsewhere some of it has been to our total benefit some of it has been a conciliatory benefit he we enjoy a relationship with China we haven't had and maybe ever III don't know that that what he's doing is confusing bad evil wrong or fattening but what I do know is that it's in his head and it's been working thus far on the talking diplomatic level and so I'm not prepared to throw it over just because I don't understand it with that which I don't understand I did I get your point I mean I get your point I mean in the way he sees the world here and his base and I think let me go back to Northwood here it seems to me even a year a year and a half and Donald Trump doesn't have a lot of interest in foreign policy he's made a group of promises on the stump and he's committed to realizing each one of them I've never seen it a president so adamant going through his checklist okay is it really his idea of American exceptionalism American forces that really domestic politics driving it for him well I think you're right I mean there is a very very great interest in domestic politics and he has made a whole lot of promises and as you say yeah I think the first thing that Steve Manon did when he entered the White House as his adviser was to put up a whiteboard and put a whole load earnest of the promises made and and start ticking them off but I think the the foreign policy perspective the president Trump has is one of increasing American power and extracting as much value economically commercially financially and so on from allies associated powers and from enemies and I think all that is down to his a long-term idea that America is being ripped off you know and I think if you look at domestic politics then the kind of people he defines as core Americans he basically is selling the same message that you being ripped off white American men in particular by women by minorities by immigrants and so on and he lost status of what he's going to do law restore American okay okay I'm gonna jump in here it'll mail at home and we have an American marred brain sort of after a very short break we'll continue our discussion on American exceptionalism stay with us welcome back to crosstalk where all things are considered on Peter Lorre belt remind you were discussing American exceptionalism okay David you know ever since Trump entered the Oval Office a lot of us have been trying to understand if there's a rhyme or reason to his foreign policy and I think that even on this program its kind of coming together it seems to me it's kind of like going back to the 19th century great powers competition without all the values that that were pushed since the Second World War it just it's just really kind of brute power and advantage and and looking for competitive advantage and it's it's very brusque and it seems to appeal just as Interjet but pointed out to us in the first part of the program it does appeal to his base go ahead David yeah I think you know it appears to be all Donald Trump but just as you know Reagan and Gorbachev came out of the meeting and were told by their advisors no no no you can't get rid of nuclear weapons every time Trump has a good idea like get rid of NAFTA and get rid of NATO he talked to his advisors and it's off the table I think that you know it was actually an actual break with u.s. exceptionalism is not on the agenda of Donald Trump or his advisors I mean it would look like joining the International Criminal Court joining the Convention on the Rights of the Child joy in the United States is party to fewer major human rights treaties than almost any other nation on earth it would mean giving up the veto at the United Nations it would mean getting out of Afghanistan that there's a promise I'd like Trump to keep I mean this is a guy who promised no more of these Wars and bomb their family you know kill their families bomb the bleep out of them so it's easy to say he's keeping his promise because he promised black and white but the ones I'd like him to keep he's not keeping as well as you know a few like building the wall and walking up Hillary that I don't necessarily need him to keep either but you know this is not this is a guy who thinks he's running the world and it's dangerous to what extent he is but he's not overruling the weapons dealers or the the big players in Washington DC you know yeah Michael that seems to be very contradictory because he said in interviews that the United States shouldn't be the policemen of the world but in fact it remains the same okay and particularly you know I mean look at the Korean Peninsula I mean a peace between the Korea's denuclearization maybe the American troops could go home there'd be no reason for them to be there and then the entire foreign policy elite has their hair on fire like oh my god peace don't let it break out it'll change our world okay I mean it seems to me he's just going really against the the you know against the stream there and he keeps me and he keeps coming out with these ideas I mean you know like I said earlier I mean you know threatening Iran in the most coarse way and then say oh I'd like to meet with no condition preconditions I mean the outside looking in finds that very very confusing I mean the rainy ins have already said through their aides is that why would we sit down with someone that broke a country that broke a treaty that we just signed only a few years ago I mean I how does that show them America leading go ahead Michael yeah well it wasn't a treaty and they didn't sign anything but that's that's a semantic problem we had well it's an Internet Trump is agreed I mean though they were it was a it's multilateral it wasn't just with the Americans okay go ahead mmm-hmm but I think the the the point you're making is good and and it's correct but it stops and and I think that's what we have to focus on is that the goals his foreign policy goals are as the professor correctly observed although I think for reasons different than he observes them and that is that we are interested in better trade we are interested in exercising our trade power and to increase American presence and and wealth at home American exceptionalism America first through trade treaties through trade work as opposed to naked aggression and use of foreign power which other presidents have used Obama was roundly criticized on the right for wanting to meet with the Iranians with no preconditions I find it interesting that my brother's on the right don't have a problem with Trump doing the same thing I just I just throw that out as an observation but hang on Michael I mean in in in the same week basically threatening hostilities with Iran and then saying you want to meet with preconditions you know have to worry about your friends on the left or right you have to try to figure out what the president is talking about okay that's not my point okay no this was the same you know your point is right but this is the same tactic we took with North Korea you know little Kim Rocketman blah blah blah a terrible person gonna blow you off face the earth you're gonna blow us off face the earth next thing you know we're meeting in Singapore this is the art of the deal this is a part of the tactics of moving forward this is part of the noise involved in making the deal in making the negotiation and doing the work and it's Trump he's unique he is rare he is something we haven't seen before the swamp can't make out her tail out of them and nor can anyone else and this goes back to my earlier point which was just buckle up just as you've observed many times Peter buckle up and you're just gonna have to wait to see how it boils out gray swamp will do their best to keep their arm around it I just don't know how it's gonna work out okay brace for impact okay Indrajit let me go back to you here then and then okay so what is the justification for the United States being in Afghanistan it's not bringing democracy there anymore apparently what house what's the justification for the illegal behavior of the United States in Syria is it bringing democracy there anymore it's not apparently so why are they still there see I mean this makes it very patently obvious it's just brute force beyond international law this is what trumpet is opening up to go ahead well I think you know when we look at the big picture of global change we have a whole range of new emerging powers some of which are very very powerful economically and increasingly powerful militarily and they're looking around the world for resources and they're looking to increase their influence in order to protect their lines of communication China for example is building the one belt one road initiative which is going to be on a right across from China all the way to Spain and in through the Indian Ocean you've got non-state actors like Isis and other organizations also challenging and destabilizing allies and other regimes as well and I think what really President Trump is trying to do is is effectively grappled with the same problem which post Cold War presidents have kind of tried to outline which is the whole world environment has changed the big difference I think with President Trump is he doesn't really look at the idea of in Germany of building an orderly system or an ordered a rules-based system or rather he wants to open it up he wants to loosen it up and he wants to make it more transactional though I think what he's trying to do is say look we've got this big international series of regimes America has been ripped off it's paying too much it's has too many large deficits with everybody and what we are going to do is we're going to flex our national strength and try to renegotiate our position within it and effectively subordinate everybody else okay not that it's we the big grand plan okay well again like I said it looks like it's going back to the great powers of the 19th century without all of the rhetoric at least it's more transparent David you mentioned Russia is it really worth it for Trump to go down this path we had the Helsinki summit I was critical of the president's delivery at the press conference like I was and in Singapore as well it's not his forte he's got to work on his game there and then he wanted another summit and then walk blocked it back the Russians had invited him to Moscow why is this so important to him is it a campaign promise or is it just you know that the media hates it when he does it and that he just pushes back the show that I am president and I'm gonna do what I want to do well what is his fascination here go ahead David well I think there is is all kinds of pressure on him to meet with and work with Russia and to not do so and to treat Russia as having attacked the United States and started a war into engaging war with Russia and everywhere in between I think that it's appropriate that the United States and Russia as the major nuclear weapons powers meet and get rid of those damn things before they destroy us I think it's it's critical for the United States and Russia as two of the nations doing the most to destroy our natural environment to meet and start reversing those policies David that's not so much of the agenda maybe like I'm in complete agreement with you and I'm gonna stay with David here what why it seems to me that Trump's engagement with Russia should come out very clear Twitter is fine with me I need to deal with Vladimir Putin to sign a new arms control agreement it's about to expire in 2021 this is what's most important to all of humanity why can't he just write that I mean that is very straightforward and you know what David it's transactional what Trump is supposed to be all about go ahead David well it would make perfect sense it would fit with some of his agenda but it is not where he comes from it's not something he knows anything about it's not something he's hired anybody to keep around him who would advise him to do and it's you know these got the US media and the Democrats and half the public screaming at him not to do anything cooperative with Russia even if it kills us all yeah so it's not shocking that he hasn't come out with that position but he should he damn well good and the world and Russia should be pushing him in that direction okay all right Michael I mean where does he go from this from his Russia gambit now I mean he's put it off until next year's that because of the midterms it's because he can't do anything transactional because I just like David said perfect crystal-clear even trying to save humanity he's the boogie man Donald Trump is evil incarnate even if he wants to save humanity that's a problem in the United States that's a problem with American exceptionalism 40 seconds to you Michael my friend last word real quick and I promise to stay inside my time light the Trump never Telegraph's what he's going to do he'll make promises in a campaign context he'll have it he'll allude to things in a domestic policy context but he's never gonna say upfront what he's gonna do it's one of his huge criticisms of his predecessors and so because he hasn't said it's there doesn't mean it's not going to be there and he's had some surprises foreign policy-wise of stuff no one expected but it was always part of his design and I think that we just have to buckle up and wait well you know that's why I call you one of my Donald Trump sure purrs that was a very good answer I like that that's all the time we have gentlemen many thanks to my guests in Washington Charlottesville and in Northwood and thanks to our viewers for watching us here at RT see you next time and remember Rostock rules
