hello and welcome to crosstalk where all things are considered I'm Peter labelled Bitcoin for some it's the perfect marriage of technology and finance for others it's a get rich scheme though no one can deny its market value with soaring and becoming an attractive alternative to the current global banking system is Bitcoin revolutionizing the world crosstalking bitcoin I'm joined by my guest Mitch Firestein in New York he is a fund manager and author of the book planet Ponzi in Atlantic we have Jeffrey Tucker he is director of content for the foundation for economic education and in Cambridge we cross to Garrick High omen he is a research fellow at the University of Cambridge or a gentleman crosstalk whirls in effect that means he can jump in anytime you want I always appreciate it Gary let me go to you first in Cambridge explain what is going on with Bitcoin I mean I'm of the age and I used to work in finance I can remember the dot-com bubble and then its meltdown here not being very well-versed in Bitcoin what is going on here is this just speculation or is this the new shiny radiant future go ahead in Cambridge right well I think I think a little bit of both to be honest and certainly we've seen you know some aspects of this story before as you mentioned you know after the dot-com bubble exploded in 2000 2001 there were a number of winners that emerged from that area and a number of new companies that were born after that have done quite well you know Bitcoin has already been declared dead several times in 2011 Wired wrote a an article saying the rise and fall of Bitcoin we saw the crash in 2014 yet it keeps coming back so wouldn't surprise me if we have another crash maybe a few more in front of us but it does seem that there's something important happening here with regards to the future of finance the future of money yeah well at least for a small number of people they become at least I guess technically in the cloud somewhere fabulously rich it's really an amazing story Jeffrey I mean Garrett called this I think in an article a minor miracle is that it would you use the word miracle here let me go to Jeffrey in Atlantic yeah I read that article and I I appreciate that term actually it kind of is nobody ever thought anything like this was possible before 2008 before the white paper of 2 of October 2008 we didn't really have the means to do what the blockchain does today just for background and blockchain is the real underlying technology of Bitcoin and the real reason for its value bitcoin is just an expression of that technological value and blockchain allows to do something we've always wanted to do since the ancient world but never had the ability to do it thanks to these distributed networks and cryptography we can do it now you know Mitch I guess I guess Geoffrey kind of put it in succinctly for me because you know I was in finance for a number of years and there's always you know what's it backed up by you know you know what what are the assets you know you know you always look at that and then but what Geoffrey just said there kind of explains it it's the technology is the safety that's what's it backing it up here do you buy that because you know you can say this is a scheme it's a get rich but I mean there's something to it and people are making money here Anna makes everyone interested to get involved in it if you have the means go go ahead and Mitch how do you explain it all well I mean we need perspective I think bitcoin has come about in a time where the central bank's wreckless central bank policy around the world has distorted every market and too much credit too much debt and too much leverage have created instability in the financial markets so we need to add perspective so we need to look at risk versus reward with Bitcoin and the Bitcoin trade so Bitcoin has gigantic volatility you're seeing 30% moves either way in a day or 40% moves for so it's not for the faint of heart so you know my perspective from an investor and being in the banking community internationally for 38 years you look at the iconic figures like Jamie Dimon who said it's a Ponzi scheme and it's going to zero he's totally wrong but the establishment banks and the way that the fractional banking system works people want to escape from that people want to escape from the establishment but what we've got going on here just to be clear is we've got inflation in every asset class stocks are trading at stratospheric valuations Apple has a market cap approaching eclipsing one trillion dollars Facebook at 600 billion so if you look yesterday a couple sorry if you look recently you saw a pullback in the Nasdaq the Fang stocks Facebook Apple and all the technology issues they lost 60 billion dollars in market cap in a day where the market cap of Bitcoin is what around 160 million dollars so on Arella of basis it's a much smaller move and it's a very emerging market so I think we've got to look at where we are and it's an alternative asset class I mean you're looking at art a Leonardo da Vinci painting traded at four hundred and fifty million dollars right so I mean we need to put it into the proper historical perspective now stocks are way overvalued so are bonds and so is property so people are looking to get out of the dollar system and I happen to agree you need to diversify but I think you should also get some precious metals gold and silver which have been currencies for 6,000 years let me dollar is backed by fundamentally not nothing okay let me go back to Cambridge care really I mean there's a lot of people are saying that large investors are getting involved interested in Bitcoin is that distorting the price because they have the deep pockets at this price level to get into the market is there something behind that there that you know it because I having been in finance I mean that this is something this is speculation okay I mean that people are not buying on facts are buying on speculation right now go ahead in Cambridge right I think certainly the hedge funds the the big whales that are coming in the billion the billionaires we read about you know are certainly influencing the price direction but I think there's still a lot of money on the sidelines I was at a hedge fund conference recently and less than 20% of of the funds in the room and there are some pretty big funds in the room have taken a step into this space and I think the ones that have a lot of them have done so as individuals rather than putting their funds in because you know it's still very difficult to short Bitcoin yeah there's major counterparty risk a lot of the exchanges crypto currency exchanges won't do things like reveal their their financials are audited financials to fund so things that you know hedge funds are used to having in typical markets they trade in or not in place yet here but they're coming if CME Nasdaq do come into the market with futures platforms you know if things like ETFs and you know other things roll out bring more regulation to the space then I think you will see even more hedge funds come in in the price you know couldn't go either way frankly I think that the the investment playing field has been a bit lopsided in favor of the Bowles and that could level and a lot of the hedge fund guys aren't passionate about crypto and frankly they would probably I think from a psychological perspective prefer to make money if Bitcoin crashes on the way down then going up that would certainly help them rationalize their lateness to the marnik you know market you know Jeffrey it's very interesting is that it's I think one of the interesting phenomenons about Bitcoin is its lack of regulation and going back what Mitch had to say here and we have to remember this phenomena came into being after the financial crisis of 2008 which the banks were responsible for and so it's is is is this an element of that here because that the freedom of here but go ahead jump in go ahead yeah you know this certainly is the the the I think of the success of Bitcoin is in part attributable to the fact that it has not been managed from the center it's not been regulated and that allows a lot of innovation or people to try out things you know you want to talk about market caps you can talk about 150 billion for Bitcoin but really you have to look at the whole class of crypto assets right now and you're looking at last I checked about 350 billion once you include all the various tokenized block chains that are out there all the various ethereum applications their various alt coins and and we're just beginning to see these we're gonna see things coming up within the next year like these lightning networks that are going to be used for small transactions that are going to fix the prevailing problems that exist in Bitcoin which is that the networks are vastly clogged right now it's very expensive to send and receive Bitcoin it's it's growing so hard so fast it's almost become unusable just by itself for regular small transactions that's disasters are looking for things like a yeah that's the reason why I never really got into it because it's it's not easy to move around at least I'm not adept at doing those kind of things you know Mitch and other people are saying that'll this whole thing with a Bitcoin it's really just an investment and it's not really a mechanism to buy and sell it is to park your money somewhere and leave it there because you don't trust the banks I mean it for it to be really Universal you have to be able to be able to use your wallet as they call it in just you know and buy things and sell things it's not that easy to do it's not widely accepted you know many a more innovative people do say they accept they go ahead Mitch it's part of it you know it's part of a diversification strategy where you'd have some Bitcoin and just sit on it and not worry about what your basis was and whatever the losses are you're going to eat the losses and if you get a profit out of it fine but you know it when you have that much volatility you know I disagree that the big hedge funds will get involved in this when you have a 30 percent volatility swing each direction so from peak to trough and back up again down and up again I mean no investor wants to tolerate that kind of volatility and how can you manage that kind of volatility becomes very difficult so are the hedge funds and the banks going to jump in headfirst up at these levels probably not if we get a more bit a bit more stability into these markets you'll see more investment but also from that risk reward perspective you've also got to keep in mind that this is a non regulated market that's the attractiveness from people but governments have overreached like we're seeing in the media right now the deep state runs America they're trying to rewrite history here with these statue wars and that's always a dangerous time so if too many people get on the Bitcoin train and get on the crypto train the government could come in one day and say it's illegal in this country we're cracking down on everybody because right now when you open up an account they demand the KYC know your customer information and they they will when it becomes bigger they will try to regulate it and they will try to control it it's difficult for the government to let anything come out of its you know come out of its grasp the Federal Reserve prints willy-nilly through trillions and trillions of dollars since we went off the gold standard backed by nothing now that's this is a Ponzi scheme the government then that's what my book is about the government debt globally is a Ponzi scheme the government's can never repay this debt and we're about to hit a wall so should people invest in alternative asset classes absolutely is a Leonardo da Vinci painting were painting worth half a billion dollars is an apartment in Midtown midtown Manhattan worth six hundred million dollars I would argue no it's not Wishon prices from when I went to university have gone up two thousand percent yep where real wages since the 1980s are flat so how does that work out when I got out of school I could have bought it my two bedroom and they let me let me jump in here fifty thousand the gentleman I have to go to a break and after that short break we'll continue our discussion on Bitcoin staying with Archie welcome back to crosstalk where all things are considered on Peter labelled to remind you were discussing Bitcoin let me go back to you in in Cambridge while it is a fascinating concept these crypto currencies there is the concern of accountability in illegal drugs arms and other kinds of illegal activity can stay under the radar of the authorities I mean I think that's the kind of a downside also you know when people talk about it as being a new fiat currency one day I mean you know people are buying big-ticket items because they are avoiding taxation and things like that so I mean it kind of cuts both ways here I guess really the most important question will be if this kinds of cryptocurrencies are successful what is the temptation of governments to step in to regulate it and would regulation kill it go ahead right now it's been very interesting to watch the the migration of regulatory interest across the space me first we had law enforcement with the rise of the Silk Road and the online dark web its use of Bitcoin taken interest in the sector more recently securities regulators and and with the up swinging in prices I'm sure tax authorities are kind of next in line to to start getting involved with regards the law enforcement question you know it's a it's a it's a double-edged sword for law enforcement because on the one hand you know you know these these currencies do enable privacy on dark web transactions but on the other hand law enforcement when they catch a criminal who's been using Bitcoin and they get a hold of their wallet software they get effectively their books and they may have a good chance of recovering some of the funds and that's not something you get with a cash criminal where there isn't record-keeping so you can use the blockchain to prosecute cases and that has been done and law enforcement I think at least in some jurisdictions is steadily becoming more open to seeing crime committed with with blockchain technology it does give them an advantage over cash crime okay it's a very transparent technology that's an amazing plus for Jeffrey earlier this week there was a San Francisco judge putting pressure on a company that trades in these commodities in these currencies here they want to see their books they want to see names they want to see transactions here what kind of threat is that to Bitcoin or can Bitcoin evolve with this kind of supervision in regulation from the outside because my sense is maybe you can correct me of our own the people that started this whole thing don't like the state they don't like Authority they they really want to be on their own here we got to see an encroachment on this on these kinds of of currencies and and you know alternative financial mechanisms go ahead you know the regulation of the exchanges began in the spring of 2013 so far as I'm concerned it was a disaster we would have been much further along without these regulations this is the main way the government can control Bitcoin it's not actually controlling Bitcoin what they're doing is controlling the traffic between national monies and and crypto assets coming and going they can control that and the US has some of the worst regulations in the world on on crypto assets right now on these exchanges why is that Jeffrey why is these markets are global why is that why is that situation exists in the US well because the regulators are trying to force a modern digital technology into an analog old-world style regulatory framework and it's not working and all it's doing is driving the innovation out of this country and to other places you know you can buy Bitcoin much easier in a place like Israel then you can in the United States or in Brazil you know I've I've I've been to exchanges all over the world most of them are very free and easy and there's a lot of entrepreneurship there in the US it's all about command and control it's a huge mistake for American regulators to be taking this direction because they're just gonna drive the innovation and the capital outside the borders anyone and crypto assets in general our global technology they don't care about the nation-state okay Mitch you know address that issue there because I mean the all mighty dollar it's a threat you know Bitcoin and all these other things are a threat to the global domination of the dollar they says I'm obviously something the US doesn't want to have happen right I mean you're right we're talking about US dollar hegemony and you know my view is us the days of u.s. dollar hegemony are very limited look before the United States became the reserve currency I think in 1913 when they created the Federal Reserve which is a disaster that should be shuttered we the British Sterling was the reserve currency of the world for 300 years now was the United States responsible with the petro dollar and going off the gold standard in the Nixon era I would argue no I would argue that this has caused market distortion I would argue that the central bank policies in the last 10 years have been more destructive than the good that they've provided because I don't see that we've created growth for the trillions of dollars in debt that we've created now the as we saw in the last administration in Washington big government is in right now so our our government is gargantuan and they want overreach with everything and every part of people's live is in America and to do that if you get an iron fist on the banking system and make people take away cash like one of the professors at Harvard wrote a book to get rid of all cash make people put their money into the bank this is this is a very dangerous thing that's why people are migrating to other platforms so we're at a point in time in history that could be very pivotable pivotal as to how we move forward with this but you know the media is controlled and if you look at regulation they don't regulate companies like Amazon that dips their fingers into everything in every different business or Facebook or Google that have become oligarchy Oleg our keys and basically these are they're controlling the content that everybody sees and this is where the regulatory agencies should be looking not to control people's currency movements or whether they want to buy gold or invest a bit in Bitcoin they should look at controlling the Facebook's the googles and looking at news the news entities because news in this country has become opinion and political advocacy and this is a way for the liberal left to rewrite history which is extremely dangerous if we look mark Thompson who ran BBC during the Jimmy Saville pedophile scandal snuck out of London and came to run the New York Times and people have forget about history and where people are and how they move around but the same establishment figures are running things 160 companies used to control the media now it's down to 6 yeah one of the things I can Cambridge one of the things I find appealing about Bitcoin and I can't say that I'm an expert on it by a longshot it seems to promote entrepreneurship which i think is a really good thing again you know people that want to get out of the system away from the system away from regulation is it fair to say that this these cryptocurrencies would be good for innovation III think absolutely I don't think anyone doubts that and I think actually you know is you know I think people can argue about how bad the regulation is but but in certain markets there's been a very pro cryptocurrency attitude because of the innovative aspects of it and and people are taking a much lighter touch in Switzerland and in the UK even and and and elsewhere because of the amount of investment that's coming in because of the you know faster cheaper better ways we can do things with this technology and not just the technology itself but also the new funding channels that are opening up I mean the ico phenomenon which we havein really talked about is is on the one hand scary because there are some projects out there that you know clearly are fraudulent but at the same time you're also opening up access to early-stage technology to seed stage technology to anyone around the world with an internet connection this used to be something you had to be a rich VC right be able to do now if you have a computer have a little cryptocurrency you can invest in early-stage technology that has a lot of risks and it also has a lot of opportunities it's personally for me I take an exciting part of this story yeah you know Mitch you know I'm glad you brought that up oh okay yeah Geoffrey go ahead jump in yeah no I just well I'm glad you brought up this point about the ICO because they've been kind of smeared and the financial press is being you know just just scams and it's true there are some there's some rackets out there but the truth is that this is an amazing innovation yeah that allows people to rate any business to raise raise money from anybody without using any financial intermediaries I mean they the amount of innovation a capital that's going to unleash on the planet earth is beyond leaf I mean it's inconceivable what the ICL market could do to transform the nature of capital markets themselves over the next 10 years yeah Mitch go ahead jump in yeah the issue the issue with the ICO market as I see it it's an exciting market but it's the wild wild west in early days and what's going to happen is there the the propaganda bullhorns of the media and advocates for the JPMorgan's and the Goldmans who are being infringed upon when these offerings come out and they're not going to get their fees so what will happen is it'll make an example out of one that fails like the media does they'll have you know blow it up into a epic proportion this is bad you're going to get ripped off don't do this give us your money only invest through something that we vet for you so yeah there will be winners and losers and you have to keep the perspective like I said at the beginning there's perspective and risk and reward and don't you know don't go out and mortgage your house and put everything into Bitcoin or an ICO but look you look at this as a portion of your portfolio and have a diversification in your portfolio and when you when you go into a high-risk thing like an ICO do your due diligence do your own homework and like I say in my book don't ever invest in anything that you don't fully understand if you don't fully understand it and you invest in it then you deserve to lose what you lose but you know if you give it your best don't put all your money into it don't put all your eggs in one basket diversify put a little bit into it and if you take a loss on that and you make a profit somewhere else then you can balance out but your payout with some of these is going to be exponential as we've witnessed before the problem comes in when you try to harness the volatility okay Gary let me go back to UK which give you the last word here what does Bitcoin in similar currencies what do they have to do to create confidence in people that just see it as too risky what maybe one or two steps they need to install well I think you know similar to the mid to late 90s during the the dot-com kind of run-up we're in the infrastructure building phase for cryptocurrency and crypto assets I mean yesterday we had three major exchanges experienced significant problems two of those exchanges are gonna be relied upon by CM II for their futures market that simply can't happen you know on a regular basis like it does for this to be taken seriously by institutions to be trusted by a broader class of individual so more capital markets infrastructure is needed the right balance the regulation is needed and I think people absolutely need to understand that this is you know still very early stage very volatile I agree with the you know the comments that have been made about only put into this what you can afford to lose because it is still very high risk ok well it's it's been an interesting ride I'm sure we're gonna see a lot more ahead that's all the time we have gentlemen many thanks um I guess in New York Atlanta and in Cambridge and thanks to our viewers for watching us here at RT see you next time and remember Rostock rules
