1
00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:03,650
THERE ARE TWO NEW LAWSUITS THAT
HAVE ARISEN AROUND TRUMPS

2
00:00:03,650 --> 00:00:07,810
TRANSIT SERVICE MEMBER BAN AND
LET'S GIVE YOU A LITTLE BIT MORE

3
00:00:07,810 --> 00:00:11,870
INFORMATION ABOUT WHO IS FILING
THEM AND WHO IS BEHIND THEM.

4
00:00:11,870 --> 00:00:13,340
VERSES FROM THE ACLU.

5
00:00:13,340 --> 00:00:19,849
THE MARYLAND BRANCH FILED A
LAWSUIT RIGHT AFTER THE TRANS

6
00:00:19,849 --> 00:00:23,769
BAN CAME INTO EFFECT AND THEN
LAST FRIDAY DURING THE NEWS

7
00:00:23,769 --> 00:00:26,679
TRUMP BROUGHT UP AGAIN BY TRUMP
THROUGH A NEW MORE FORMAL ISSUE.

8
00:00:26,679 --> 00:00:32,348
THE ACLU HAD TWEETED WILL SEE
YOU IN COURT.

9
00:00:32,348 --> 00:00:36,170
THEY HAVE FIVE TRANSGENDER
SERVICEMEMBERS, THERE'S A NINE

10
00:00:36,170 --> 00:00:40,809
YEAR VETERAN, A TEN YEAR
VETERAN, A SIX-YEAR ACTIVE-DUTY

11
00:00:40,809 --> 00:00:41,809
AIRMAN.

12
00:00:41,809 --> 00:00:44,269
IT IS KIND OF AMAZING.

13
00:00:44,269 --> 00:00:46,870
THERE IS A 13 YEAR VETERAN AND A
16 YEAR VETERAN, TRAIN

14
00:00:46,870 --> 00:00:49,109
SERVICE MEMBERS OUT THERE ALL
BEHIND THIS.

15
00:00:49,109 --> 00:00:55,179
THE SECOND IS BY LAMBDA LEGAL
AND THERE IS A 12 YEAR VETERAN

16
00:00:55,179 --> 00:01:00,339
INVOLVED IN THAT AND THEN TO
FOLKS WHO WANT - TWO TRANS

17
00:01:00,339 --> 00:01:10,979
INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE TRYING TO
JOIN THE SERVICE AND ONE OF THEM

18
00:01:10,979 --> 00:01:12,030
IS DREW LAYNE.

19
00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:15,140
HE WANTS TO JOIN THE MILITARY
AND THE AIR FORCE AS A

20
00:01:15,140 --> 00:01:19,550
SURVIVAL OF ASIAN RESISTANCE AND
ESCAPE SPECIALIST AND HERE

21
00:01:19,550 --> 00:01:23,420
IS WHAT DREW SAID FOR HIMSELF.

22
00:01:23,420 --> 00:01:28,479
HE SAID:

23
00:01:28,479 --> 00:01:37,320
RIGHT NOW HE IS 16 YEARS OLD.

24
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:43,770
IT IS A SUPER INSPIRING STORY.

25
00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:49,250
HIS MOTHER, LAURA GARZA SAID ñ
AND SHE HAS SAID SHE AGREES WITH

26
00:01:49,250 --> 00:01:52,650
TRUMP ON CERTAIN ISSUES, JUST
NOT THIS ONE.

27
00:01:52,650 --> 00:02:00,420
SHE SAYS:

28
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:09,209
I ABSOLUTELY AGREE WITH HER.

29
00:02:09,209 --> 00:02:12,180
I'M CURIOUS TO SEE WHAT SHE
AGREES WITH TRUMP ON, MY

30
00:02:12,180 --> 00:02:14,580
BUT WHATEVERÖ IS NOT RELEVANT.

31
00:02:14,580 --> 00:02:18,290
THAT 16-YEAR-OLD IS AMAZING.

32
00:02:18,290 --> 00:02:22,410
THE FACT THAT HE IS SO CLEAR IN
WHAT HE WANTS TO DO AND HE

33
00:02:22,410 --> 00:02:25,680
IS A PERSON WITH CONVICTIONS,
PERSON WHO IS MOTIVATED AND

34
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:28,400
HUNGRY AND WANTS TO FULFILL HIS
GOALS.

35
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:31,519
THAT IS THE TYPE OF AMERICAN
EVERYONE IN THIS COUNTRY

36
00:02:31,519 --> 00:02:35,010
SHOULD BE PROUD OF, NOT THE TYPE
OF AMERICAN THAT WE SHOULD

37
00:02:35,010 --> 00:02:39,209
FIGHT TO TAKE RIGHTS AWAY FROM
AND SO LOOK, HOW MANY

38
00:02:39,209 --> 00:02:43,629
16-YEAR-OLDS DO YOU SEE FIGHTING
FOR THINGS LIKE THIS?

39
00:02:43,629 --> 00:02:46,550
EVEN COMING FROM A
DISENFRANCHISED GROUP OF

40
00:02:46,550 --> 00:02:50,330
PEOPLE, HAVING THE COURAGE TO
COME FORWARD AND SAYING NO,

41
00:02:50,330 --> 00:02:51,370
THIS IS NOT OKAY.

42
00:02:51,370 --> 00:02:54,739
I'M NOT GOING TO LET TRUMP
STOP ME FROM PROTECTING MY

43
00:02:54,739 --> 00:02:56,680
COUNTRY, FROM SERVING MY
COUNTRY.

44
00:02:56,680 --> 00:03:01,740
WHEN AMAZING PERSON AND LOOK, WE
ALL KNOW WHAT THE TRANSGENDER

45
00:03:01,740 --> 00:03:03,440
BAN WAS REALLY ABOUT.

46
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:06,940
IT'S ABOUT DOING SOMETHING THAT
GOES AGAINST WHAT OBAMA DID

47
00:03:06,940 --> 00:03:10,920
DURING HIS ADMINISTRATION
BECAUSE ANYTHING THAT OBAMA DID

48
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:14,610
REGARDLESS OF HOW LOGICAL AND
REGARDLESS OF HOW MUCH COMMON

49
00:03:14,610 --> 00:03:17,230
SENSE WAS TO BEHIND IT, TRUMP
WANTS TO DO THE OPPOSITE.

50
00:03:17,230 --> 00:03:21,990
IT'S LIKE HE IS A CHILD AND HE
WANTED TO PANDER TO HIS BASE.

51
00:03:21,990 --> 00:03:25,210
THERE HAVE BEEN NO LEGISLATIVE
WINS.

52
00:03:25,210 --> 00:03:29,670
HE HASN'T SUCCEEDED IN DOING
ANYTHING HE PROMISED TO DO AND

53
00:03:29,670 --> 00:03:34,430
THIS IS JUST AN EASY WAY OF
GETTING SOMETHING DONE PAINTING

54
00:03:34,430 --> 00:03:36,769
TO HIS BASE SAYING WHAT I CAN
TRANSGENDER PEOPLE FROM THE

55
00:03:36,769 --> 00:03:40,860
MILITARY WHICH IS ACTUALLY GOING
TO COST US A LOT OF MONEY

56
00:03:40,860 --> 00:03:44,569
BECAUSE WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO
FIND MILITARY MEMBERS TO

57
00:03:44,569 --> 00:03:47,440
REPLACE THOSE WHO ARE NOW
BANNED.

58
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:50,250
WE ARE GOING TO HAVE TO TRAIN
THEM, SPEND A CONSIDERABLE

59
00:03:50,250 --> 00:03:52,500
AMOUNT OF RESOURCES TO MIXER
THEY ARE PREPARED TO BE

60
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:56,130
PART OF THE MILITARY AND SO
IT'S JUST SUCH A HIM,

61
00:03:56,130 --> 00:03:58,129
NONSENSICAL WAY TO GO ABOUT
THINGS.

62
00:03:58,129 --> 00:04:00,020
AND THAT IS IF HE MEANS IT.

63
00:04:00,020 --> 00:04:04,379
IF HE MEANS TO BAN THEM THEN IT
WILL COST WHAT IS A $70,000

64
00:04:04,379 --> 00:04:05,379
PER PERSON?

65
00:04:05,379 --> 00:04:09,269
THEIRS UP TO 15,000 PEOPLE,
TRANS SERVICEMEMBERS RIGHT NOW

66
00:04:09,269 --> 00:04:14,400
WHO HAVE JOINED IN THE TIME OR
COME OUT IN THE TIME THAT IT HAS

67
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:17,290
BEEN IN EFFECT WHICH IS JUST
SINCE LAST YEAR.

68
00:04:17,290 --> 00:04:22,510
IT IS RIDICULOUS AND WHAT IS
EVEN MORE RIDICULOUS ñ WHAT I

69
00:04:22,510 --> 00:04:27,080
MEAN BY IF HE MEANS IT IS THOSE
FOLKS, ACCORDING TO WHAT WAS

70
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:31,110
ORIGINALLY LAID OUT IN ITS WE
AND LATER MADE MORE FORMAL

71
00:04:31,110 --> 00:04:34,980
THROUGH THIS RANDOM AMBIGUOUS
STATEMENT THAT GIVES A CERTAIN

72
00:04:34,980 --> 00:04:38,100
AMOUNT OF LEEWAY TO GENERALS TO
DEFINE WHETHER THE PEOPLE WHO

73
00:04:38,100 --> 00:04:42,260
ARE IN THE CURRENT SERVICE ARE
ALLOWED TO STAY THERE.

74
00:04:42,260 --> 00:04:43,600
HE'S CRAZY.

75
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:46,930
IT DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE AND
WHAT IS GOING TO HAPPEN IS

76
00:04:46,930 --> 00:04:51,290
GENERAL AFTER GENERAL HAS SAID I
DON'T SEE ANY REASON WHY

77
00:04:51,290 --> 00:04:53,270
THEY WOULDN'T BE ALLOWED TO
SERVE.

78
00:04:53,270 --> 00:04:55,990
THAT IS RIGHT AND KEEP IN
MIND THAT THIS IS COMING AT

79
00:04:55,990 --> 00:05:00,600
A TIME WHEN TRUMP JUST GAVE A
SPEECH ABOUT ANOTHER SURGE

80
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:03,720
IN AFGHANISTAN.

81
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:08,990
YOU WANT TO DEPLOY MORE TROOPS
TO A FAILING WAR AND

82
00:05:08,990 --> 00:05:13,710
SIMULTANEOUSLY BAN AN ENTIRE
GROUP OF PEOPLE FROM BEING

83
00:05:13,710 --> 00:05:15,060
PART OF OUR MILITARY.

84
00:05:15,060 --> 00:05:20,930
IT WAS A SIMILARLY AMBIGUOUS
STATEMENT ABOUT A SURGE.

85
00:05:20,930 --> 00:05:26,760
IT WAS AN AMBIGUOUS STATEMENT
ABOUT THE TRANS SERVICEMEMBERS.

86
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:27,860
WE SHOULD GET THEM OUT.

87
00:05:27,860 --> 00:05:28,860
YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT.

88
00:05:28,860 --> 00:05:32,110
IT'S SIGNALING TO A BASEMENT ALL
THESE FOLKS AROUND, WITH

89
00:05:32,110 --> 00:05:34,110
WORD FOR BOSSES LIKE THIS WERE
THERE LIKE WE'RE GOING TO

90
00:05:34,110 --> 00:05:37,210
CHANGE AT THIS LADY LOOK AROUND
GOING, HOW?

91
00:05:37,210 --> 00:05:40,610
THAT IS LITERALLY IMPOSSIBLE AND
IT DOESN'T HELP ANYTHING.

92
00:05:40,610 --> 00:05:44,050
THAT IS NOT SOLVING A PROBLEM
DOTTING THE MOTHER'S UP SLOWLY

93
00:05:44,050 --> 00:05:47,950
RIGHT WHEN SHE SAYS THINGS LIKE
THESE PEOPLE HAVE ALREADY, WHO

94
00:05:47,950 --> 00:05:52,930
ARE ALREADY IN THE MILITARY,
HAVE ARTIE PASSED CERTAIN TESTS.

95
00:05:52,930 --> 00:05:55,560
RANDY SAYS IT'S 2.0 TO $4.2

96
00:05:55,560 --> 00:06:00,490
MILLION PER YEAR FOR THE HEALTH
CONCERNS WHICH IS A TINY

97
00:06:00,490 --> 00:06:04,970
FRACTION OF THE $4.93 BILLION
YEARLY HEALTH BUDGET.

98
00:06:04,970 --> 00:06:07,240
JUST OUT BUDGET THAT

99
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:08,280
HOW ABOUT THIS?

100
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:10,600
LET'S FOCUS ON OTHER MILITARY
WASTE.

101
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:14,900
WE DID A STORY COUPLE OF WEEKS
AGO ABOUT HOW THE MILITARY

102
00:06:14,900 --> 00:06:18,480
DECIDED TO TAKE OUT A CONTRACT
WITH A PRIVATE CONTRACTOR THAT

103
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:25,340
MAKES UNIFORMS AND THEY SUPPLIED
THESE FOREST CAMO UNIFORMS TO

104
00:06:25,340 --> 00:06:29,340
SOLDIERS IN AFGHANISTAN, AFGHAN
SOLDIERS.

105
00:06:29,340 --> 00:06:31,700
FOREST CAMO.

106
00:06:31,700 --> 00:06:35,150
THE MAJORITY OF TERRAIN IN
AFGHANISTAN IS DESERT, IT

107
00:06:35,150 --> 00:06:37,350
IS NOT FOREST AND WHY DID THEY
DO THAT?

108
00:06:37,350 --> 00:06:40,320
THEY JUST WANTED TO GIVE OUT
A CONTRACTOR PRIVATE

109
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:43,060
CONTRACTORS TO THE TUNE OF $20
MILLION.

110
00:06:43,060 --> 00:06:46,050
BY THE WAY, THE US GOVERNMENT
HAS UNIFORMS THEY COULD'VE

111
00:06:46,050 --> 00:06:50,870
GIVEN TO THE SOLDIERS FOR FREE,
BUT THEY DID NOT DO THAT.

112
00:06:50,870 --> 00:06:55,240
PLEASE SPARE ME THE BS ABOUT WE
DON'T HAVE ENOUGH RESOURCES.

113
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:58,020
YOU HAVE RESOURCES, THEY
ARE JUST FOR PRIVATE

114
00:06:58,020 --> 00:07:00,880
CONTRACTORS NOT TAKING CARE OF
YOUR OWN SOLDIERS AND

115
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:02,690
MEMBERS OF THE MILITARY THAT'S
OF THE COUNTRY.

116
00:07:02,690 --> 00:07:05,180
YOU MIGHT BE WONDERING WHEN
TRUMP ISSUED THE MUSLIM

117
00:07:05,180 --> 00:07:10,770
BAND THAT WAS STAYED IN COURT
BECAUSE OF CERTAIN CASES BROUGHT

118
00:07:10,770 --> 00:07:13,880
AS THE PERSON FROM THE ACLU,
CHASE STRANGIO, THE STAFF

119
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:16,790
ATTORNEY POINTS OUT.

120
00:07:16,790 --> 00:07:24,370
THAT IS NOT THE CASE WITH THIS.

121
00:07:24,370 --> 00:07:31,590
ACCORDING TO CHASE:

122
00:07:31,590 --> 00:07:38,870
THAT HAS NOT HAPPENED YET.

123
00:07:38,870 --> 00:07:39,870
THAT IS FRUSTRATING.

124
00:07:39,870 --> 00:07:40,870
IT IS.

125
00:07:40,870 --> 00:07:43,840
BUT I COMMEND THE PEOPLE WHO ARE
COURAGEOUS ENOUGH TO FIGHT

126
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:44,840
TRUMP ON THIS.

127
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:46,180
YOU GUYS ARE AMAZING.

128
00:07:46,180 --> 00:07:47,390
KEEP THE GOOD FIGHT GOING.

129
00:07:47,390 --> 00:07:50,390
I KNOW IT FEELS LIKE IT'S NOT
GOING TO HAPPEN BUT I THINK

130
00:07:50,390 --> 00:00:00,000
EVENTUALLY, WE'RE GOING TO WIN.
