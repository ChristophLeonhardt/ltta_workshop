so the fine folks at these Colorado Civil Rights Commission are added again there they're targeting Jack Phillips and masterpiece cake shop yet again you may remember that the the Colorado Civil Rights Commission was rhetorically smacked down by the Supreme Court for their treatment of Phillips starting the whole gay wedding cake debacle and even though the Supreme Court punted on the fundamental question about religious liberty they they also made it very clear that the Civil Rights Commission had been hostile towards Phillips and treated him unfairly but the the Commission is back at it they they haven't learned their lesson at all I'm gonna read to you a little bit from the daily callers report on this it says Jack Phillips the Christian Baker who prevailed at the US Supreme Court after declining to create a custom wedding cake for a gay couple followed a lawsuit in federal court late Tuesday suing the Colorado Civil Rights Commission Phillips and his attorney of the Alliance defending freedom ATF say the Commission has revived its campaign against him following June's High Court decision singling masterpiece cake shop out for disparate treatment on the basis of their religious beliefs now on the same day that the High Court agreed to review the masterpiece case so this was several months ago over a year ago an attorney named R autumns Gardena called Phillips his shop and asked him to create a cake celebrating a sex transition the caller asked that the cake include a blue exterior and a pink interior which is supposed to be a reflection of scardino's transgender identity Phillips declined to create the cake given his religious conviction that sex is immutable although he did offer to sell the caller other pre-made baked goods now I should just add here very quickly that the idea that sex is immutable unchangeable that is not just Jack Phillips's religious conviction that is the conviction of science of reality and of every sane person everywhere that's just put it another way that's not a conviction at all that's just a fact so Jack Phillips understands the fact that you cannot transition your sex and so he doesn't want to create a cake that that celebrates this this this impossible thing which makes sense now in the months that followed the the bakery received requests for cakes featuring marijuana use sexually explicit messages and satanic symbols one solicitation submitted by email asked the cake shop to create a three-tiered white cake depicting satan licking a sex toy phillips believes that scar dina made all of these requests but in any case three weeks after Phillips won at the High Court the Commission issued a probable cause determination finding that there was sufficient evidence to supports c√°rdenas claim of discrimination and in a somewhat strange development the probable cause finding reads that films violated state law even though the proceedings are still in a preliminary stage okay so this is a I mean you've got this this man who not only called asking for this ridiculous cake but then it seems like proceeded to call many more times asking for increasingly vulgar and ridiculous cakes he is the one harassing Jack Phillips yet of course the Colorado Civil Rights Commission finds that Jack Phillips may well be discriminating against him so first of all let's just establish that the the Civil Rights Commission in Colorado is a disgrace they are collection of despicable vengeful bullies the whole agency should be shut down and each of the tyrants in that agency should be sued into personal financial ruin these are these are very evil people but but here's the interesting thing that they've done what all evil people do eventually which is that they've kind of dropped the masks they've they've dropped the charade and they've made their wickedness plain to everybody that's what's interesting about this this latest attack on Jack Phillips is that it undermines or I should say it exposes all of the previous attacks and it makes it clear what's always been true which is they just hate Christians and they want to punish Jack Phillips for being a Christian that's all this is about that's all that's this this has ever been about and now it's painfully obvious so let's just look at this for a moment there isn't an even halfway believable pretense of rights being violated in this case now before with the gay wedding thing they could always accuse Phillips of you know making wedding cakes for four straight people but not for gay people so they could try to hang a discrimination claim based on that which which which is by the way a misleading way of putting it and it's also irrelevant in any case because the idea that just because you make a wedding cake in one situation it means you have to make a wedding cake in every situation that of course is just it's just just ridiculous there's no that's that's that's just um there's no basis for that for that whatsoever just because you make wedding cakes doesn't mean that you can't be discerning about that discrimination it's discernment you're allowed to be discerning about what sorts of wedding cakes you make but any case um even that kind of claim as absurd and misleading as it was even that isn't valid here because it's not like Philips has ever made a cake to celebrate someone remaining the same gender there is no opposite kind of cake that Philip sells so there's no there's absolutely no basis for discrimination whether you're becoming a woman or you're becoming a man or you're becoming a werewolf or you're staying the same gender Philips is not providing a cake to celebrate it and Gardena can't obviously claim that he's been emotionally traumatized that's the gay couple in the wedding cake case they claimed the emotional trauma which was of course ridiculous there as well but it's it's self-evident that in this case this guy was laying a trap for Phillips he was hoping to find a basis upon upon which he could sue Jack Phillips at that's all this was about this was a targeted attempt now the gay couple I think targeted Phillips also but not quite as obviously what in the world is a gender transition cake anyway what does that mean is that eat that's not even a thing if I went to the most progressive bakery in the world what would I would I find something like that with is that something they have in their up their repertoire repertoire I say it very French he may as well have asked for a for an abortion cake or something like that it's the kind of cake you request when when you want your request to be denied and the fact that he happened he just so happened to make this request of the most famous Christian Baker in the country you know he just so happened just coincidental you know obviously it wasn't a coincidence this was entirely targeted so there is no hiding the real objective this time around this is anti-christian bigotry plain and simple it always was all of these cases the attacks on Christian bakers and florists and photographers and t-shirt makers etc they are and always have been acts of vengeance against Christians nothing more it's just that now it's it is it is so obvious to everyone another thing that we can see in this case though this as well should have been obvious all along is that all the stuff we heard from gay right the rights the gay rights crowd about you know how they just want the the freedom to love and to live as they wish and they want us to mind our own business and they'll mind their own business and so forth all of that is nonsense okay if they were really proponents of the kind of live-and-let-live sort of philosophy none of this would be happening because what they would say is okay some people don't want to be personally involved in our wedding that's fine that's their opinion that's their right who cares and then they would have gone about and and live their lives that's all that would have happened if you really are if you really just want people to mind our business and you're minding your own business and if that's what this is about then you not you wouldn't be doing any of this you wouldn't be taking people to court because they won't bake you a cake but this is an effort to punish Christians that's what this is they're trying to punish Christian business owners and more than that they're trying to purposefully put business owners in a situation where they have to make this choice and that has nothing to do with live-and-let-live okay this is about control this is about stamping out opposing views opposing lifestyles and exacting punishment ironically this they are doing exactly what they accused Christians of doing but which you know I've never met a Christian who's actually interested in doing that I've never met a Christian who is interested in going and finding gay people and punishing them and forcing things on a I've never met that I've never encountered that but there are quite a lot of people in the gay rights crowd who are interested in doing that to Christians now I've heard this I've heard the justification from the gay rights crowd well they'll they'll say well well Christians think that our lifestyle is sinful and that's offensive to us okay so why do you care what they think not doing anything to you not hurting you they aren't trying to drag you in the court over it no that's what you're doing that's you doing that they're just trying to live their lives and run their businesses the way that they want and you're you're free to steer clear of them what do you care so they think your lifestyles sinful so what what does that matter to you what does it matter to you that they have it Jack Phillips in his little bakery in Colorados Minor knows his own business making cakes what do you care if he's got that point of view bouncing around in his head what difference does it make to you just go live your life doesn't matter he's not doing anything to you he's not taking anything away from you you know personally I am well aware that atheists and secular people think that I am as a Christian stupid superstitious backwards etc etc I'm well aware of that and you know what they're allowed to hold that view there they can think it doesn't bother me that they think that they could they can they can think that now if they say it to my face I'll argue with them about it I'll defend myself and if they go out in public preaching it I will engage them and I'll present my side of the story but I don't seek them out specifically to try and punish them for their beliefs I don't sit around scheming ways that I can entrap an atheist I don't do that or I don't I don't think about ways that I might force him to do something that makes him uncomfortable and goes against his atheist convictions I don't do that it's because I'm a rational adult so if you're a member of the gay left and it offends you that some people disapprove of the things that you do and the way that you live okay That's Life that's life that's just what it means to live in America you know you got to just deal with that that's all you have to deal with it because we all have to deal with that no matter who you are no matter what you do there are people out there who disapprove of you and or at the very least disapprove of some of the things you do some of the things you believe that's the case for literally every person on earth so you're no different in that regard that's not persecution you're not being persecuted just because people disagree you're not no persecution let me tell you something what's happening to Jack Phillips that is per this is persecution this is a government body coming after him repeatedly to ruin him for his beliefs you want to know what person that is persecution so if you've got government bodies coming after you to personally ruin you and destroy you for your lifestyle well then then you have a case made that you're being persecuted but that's not happening to you it is happening to Jack Phillips and it's happening to Christians but Christian business owners that is what legal government persecution looks like so I'm sorry I just I have no sympathy for the for the you know the the people that go and pretend that they've been so offended its own won't make them a cake or provide flowers to them for the wedding and then they set out to destroy the person I've got no sympathy for those people because what they're doing is disingenuous it's in bad faith there they are laying booby traps and just waiting for a Christian business owner to walk into it that's what's going on and I have no sympathy for it you know the the live-and-let-live philosophy that no that's not personally my guiding philosophy in life I'm not I'm not much of a libertarian but if that is the if that is the the philosophy that you claim if you claim that that's how you then then it's got to go both ways it can't be just let me live let me live as I want but I'm gonna still try to force myself on you you can't do that it's got a it's got to go both ways that's all watching everybody thanks for listening Godspeed you
