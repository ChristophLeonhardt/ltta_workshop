it's a banana blossom so it's kind of
like an artichoke
once it spilled and and it's got a kind
of fishy texture as well it's quite
interesting we then marinate it in sorts
of spices and then we add a little bit
of seaweeds a bit that's sort of sea
fresh flavor we marinated for 24 hours
and then should be batter it lucky
wooden on the piece of it
so we've like chunky chips
I've been a vegan for a little over a
year and a half and fish and chips were
quite a big part of my fast food
beforehand so this is a real treat to me
yeah so I eat normal fish and chips I'm
a bit positioned chips on a sir I'd love
to see how this pattern
yeah it does taste too bad like bitches
like there is definitely a bitch
taste to it this would be the type of
thing if someone gave this to my dad
he'll be like this but it's not it's not
you can sort out with the texture but
the taste
it's really good
hm
this tastes like riches and chips
without this tasting like fake kitchen
tips that you're really going to enjoy
it for what it is yeah and it's
authentic it does like authentic vision
yet
if you like fish and chips because of
the fish then you might not like this
but if you like fish and chips because
of the pattern of the texture this
probably will be unsettled
you're not going to get that here but it
definitely tastes like fish the batter
it's the closest fish-and-chips I've had
since being
and
I would eat this existing fish and chips
for me this is just like battered fish
it's really good I'm not taught to
swords is
I imagine this Bobo bail fear as well
we have our vegan fish and with that we
can also make vegan fish cakes we do a
vegan sausage which we batter in our
batter so it's a battered sausage we
also do a vegan burger which is like a
fish burger using the fish cake that we
grate it so those sorts of possibilities
bearing in mind that probably 85% of
everything we sell in all our shots is
Cod they've probably taken a good temper
cent of the trade it's early days but
it's still good sign
to prove our nice it was
that's my last paper
you
