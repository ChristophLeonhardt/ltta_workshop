REGULATION. 

2
00:00:01,568 --> 00:00:02,902
WE PASSED A BILL THROUGH THIS 

3
00:00:02,902 --> 00:00:05,171
COMMITTEE LAST CONGRESS DEALING 

4
00:00:05,171 --> 00:00:06,339
WITH DATA BREACH NOTIFICATION, 

5
00:00:06,339 --> 00:00:09,876
NOT SO MUCH FOR FACEBOOK BUT 

6
00:00:09,876 --> 00:00:10,376
CREDIT CARD BREACHES. 

7
00:00:10,376 --> 00:00:10,810
A GOOD BILL. 

8
00:00:10,810 --> 00:00:12,679
MANY OF THE FRIENDS ON THE 

9
00:00:12,679 --> 00:00:14,214
OTHER SIDE VOTED AGAINST IT. 

10
00:00:14,214 --> 00:00:15,281
I THINK IT'S ONE THAT WE SHOULD 

11
00:00:15,281 --> 00:00:17,484
CONSIDER AGAIN IN LIGHT OF WHAT 

12
00:00:17,484 --> 00:00:19,219
IS GOING ON HERE. 

13
00:00:19,219 --> 00:00:22,355
YOU SIGNED A CONSENT DEGREE IN 

14
00:00:22,355 --> 00:00:22,856
2011. 

15
00:00:22,856 --> 00:00:25,558
WHEN I READ THROUGH THE 

16
00:00:25,558 --> 00:00:26,793
CONSENT, IT'S EXPLICIT. 

17
00:00:26,793 --> 00:00:29,996
THERE IS A SIGNIFICANT FINE OF 

18
00:00:29,996 --> 00:00:32,866
$40,000 PER VIOLATION PER DAY. 

19
00:00:32,866 --> 00:00:35,268
IF YOU GOT 2 BILLION USERS, YOU 

20
00:00:35,268 --> 00:00:36,870
CAN SEE HOW THOSE FINES WOULD 

21
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:37,703
MOUNT UP QUICKLY. 

22
00:00:37,703 --> 00:00:41,474
IN THE COURSE OF YOUR AUDIT, 

23
00:00:41,474 --> 00:00:43,743

>> THANK YOU, MR. CHAIRMAN. 

41
00:01:21,447 --> 00:01:22,348
WELCOME TO OUR COMMITTEE. 

42
00:01:22,348 --> 00:01:26,386
I WANT TO FOLLOW-UP ON WHAT MY 

43
00:01:26,386 --> 00:01:29,255
FRIEND FROM NORTH TEXAS TALKED 

44
00:01:29,255 --> 00:01:30,322
ABOUT ON HIS CARTOON. 

45
00:01:30,322 --> 00:01:33,560
NEXT MONTH THE GENERAL DATA

00:01:34,894 --> 00:01:38,798
GDPR GOES INTO EFFECT IN THE 

48
00:01:38,798 --> 00:01:39,365
EUROPEAN UNION. 

49
00:01:39,365 --> 00:01:40,600
THAT IS PRESCRIPTIVE ON HOW 

50
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:41,968
COMPANIES TREAT CONSUMER DATA 

51
00:01:41,968 --> 00:01:43,403
AND IT MAKES IT CLEAR THAT 

52
00:01:43,403 --> 00:01:46,839
CONSUMERS NEED TO BE IN CONTROL 

53
00:01:46,839 --> 00:01:48,174
OF THEIR OWN DATA. 

54
00:01:48,174 --> 00:01:51,377
MR. ZUCKERBERG, FACEBOOK HAS 

55
00:01:51,377 --> 00:01:52,345
COMMITTED TO ABIDING TO THESE 

56
00:01:52,345 --> 00:01:53,813
CONSUMER PROTECTIONS IN EUROPE 

57
00:01:53,813 --> 00:01:56,049
AND YOU FACE LARGE PENALTIES IF 

58
00:01:56,049 --> 00:01:56,515
THEY DON'T. 

59
00:01:56,515 --> 00:01:58,784
IN RECENT DAYS YOU SAY FACEBOOK 

60
00:01:58,784 --> 00:02:00,320
CONTENDS TO MAKE THE SAME 

61
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:01,554
SETTINGS AVAILABLE TO USERS 

62
00:02:01,554 --> 00:02:03,689
EVERYWHERE, NOT ONLY IN EUROPE. 

63
00:02:03,689 --> 00:02:06,359
DID I UNDERSTAND CORRECTLY THAT 

64
00:02:06,359 --> 00:02:07,060
FACEBOOK WOULD NOT ONLY MAKE 

65
00:02:07,060 --> 00:02:08,995
THE SAME SETTINGS AVAILABLE BUT 

66
00:02:08,995 --> 00:02:10,729
THE SAME PROTECTIONS AVAILABLE 

67
00:02:10,729 --> 00:02:14,367
TO AMERICANS THAT THEY WILL THE 

68
00:02:14,367 --> 00:02:14,667
EUROPEANS. 

69
00:02:14,667 --> 00:02:14,934
>> THEY. 

70
00:02:14,934 --> 00:02:15,601
ALL THE SAME CONTROLS WILL BE 

71
00:02:15,601 --> 00:02:17,303
AVAILABLE AROUND THE WORLD. 

72
00:02:17,303 --> 00:02:20,005
>> AND YOU COMMIT TODAY THAT 

73
00:02:20,005 --> 00:02:21,374
FACEBOOK WILL EXTEND THE SAME 

74
00:02:21,374 --> 00:02:23,443
PROTECTIONS TO AMERICANS THAT 

75
00:02:23,443 --> 00:02:26,980
EUROPEAN USERS WILL RECEIVE 

76
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:27,580
UNDER THE GDPR? 

77
00:02:27,580 --> 00:02:29,816
>> YES, CONGRESSMAN, WE BELIEVE 

78
00:02:29,816 --> 00:02:31,184
EVERYONE AROUND THE WORLD 

79
00:02:31,184 --> 00:02:32,651
DESERVES GOOD PRIVACY CONTROLS. 

80
00:02:32,651 --> 00:02:35,221
WE HAD A LOT OF THESE CONTROLS 

81
00:02:35,221 --> 00:02:35,688
IN PLACE FOR YEARS. 

82
00:02:35,688 --> 00:02:37,657
THE GDPR REQUIRES US TO DO A 

83
00:02:37,657 --> 00:02:38,057
FEW MORE THINGS. 

84
00:02:38,057 --> 00:02:41,227
WE WILL EXTEND THAT TO THE 

85
00:02:41,227 --> 00:02:41,761
WORLD. 

86
00:02:41,761 --> 00:02:43,863
>> THERE ARE MANY REQUIREMENTS 

87
00:02:43,863 --> 00:02:44,630
IN THE GDPR. 

88
00:02:44,630 --> 00:02:47,300
I WILL FOCUS ON A FEW. 

89
00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:49,468
IT REQUIRES THAT THE COMPANY'S 

90
00:02:49,468 --> 00:02:50,670
REQUEST FOR USER CONSENT TO BE 

91
00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:52,872
REQUESTED IN A CLEAR AND 

92

CONSIGNS WAY USING LANGUAGE 

93
00:02:55,074 --> 00:02:57,243
THAT IS UNDERSTANDABLE AND BE 

94
00:02:57,243 --> 00:02:58,378
CLEARLY DISTINGUISHABLE FROM 

95
00:02:58,378 --> 00:03:00,446
OTHER PIECES OF INFORMATION 

96
00:03:00,446 --> 00:03:01,247
INCLUDING TERMS AND CONDITIONS. 

97
00:03:01,247 --> 00:03:03,683
HOW WILL THAT REQUIREMENT BE 

98
00:03:03,683 --> 00:03:04,717
IMPLEMENTED IN THE UNITED 

99
00:03:04,717 --> 00:03:04,950
STATES? 

100
00:03:04,950 --> 00:03:05,852
>> CONGRESSMAN, WE ARE GOING TO 

101
00:03:05,852 --> 00:03:09,255
PUT AT THE TOP OF EVERYONE'S

APP WHEN THEY SIGN IN A TOOL 

103
00:03:11,958 --> 00:03:12,558
THAT WALKS PEOPLE THROUGH THE 

104
00:03:12,558 --> 00:03:14,327
SETTINGS AND GIVES PEOPLE THE 

105
00:03:14,327 --> 00:03:16,929
CHOICES AND ASKS THEM TO MAKE 

106
00:03:16,929 --> 00:03:18,398
DECISIONS ON HOW THEY WANT THE 

107
00:03:18,398 --> 00:03:20,199
SETTINGS SET. 

108
00:03:20,199 --> 00:03:23,836
>> ONE OF THE GDPR REQUIREMENT 

109
00:03:23,836 --> 00:03:24,437
IS DATA PORTABILITY. 

110
00:03:24,437 --> 00:03:25,738
USERS MUST BEABLE -- PERMITTED 

111
00:03:25,738 --> 00:03:28,173

THAT THEY WANT TO. 

115
00:03:32,711 --> 00:03:46,326
I KNOW FACEBOOK ALLOWS USERS

ABILITY OF USERS TO DOWNLOAD

>> CONGRESSMAN, I THINK WE MAY 

121
00:04:01,574 --> 00:04:02,775
BE UPDATING INTO A LITTLE BIT 

122
00:04:02,775 --> 00:04:04,410

JAMISON RECENTLY SAID, IS 

176
00:05:43,743 --> 00:05:44,944
BEGINNING TO LOOK A WHOLE LOT 

177
00:05:44,944 --> 00:05:45,978
LIKE THE TRUMAN SHOW WHERE 

178
00:05:45,978 --> 00:05:46,579
PEOPLE'S IDENTITIES AND 

179
00:05:46,579 --> 00:05:47,180

DON'T KNOW. 

182

AND THEN, THAT DATA IS CRUNCHED 

183
00:05:51,651 --> 00:05:52,485
AND IT IS USED. 

184
00:05:52,485 --> 00:05:55,521

PRIVACY IS FOUNDATION TO THE

00:06:50,576 --> 00:06:51,777
UP A GREAT QUESTION LAST WEEK 

218
00:06:51,777 --> 00:06:52,778
AND SAID, YOU KNOW, HEALTHCARE, 

219
00:06:52,778 --> 00:07:05,391
YOU'VE GOT HIPPO, THE FAIR 

220

SHE WAS STUNNED! 

225
00:07:09,262 --> 00:07:09,529

229
00:07:11,731 --> 00:07:13,332
AND WE HAVE HEARD PEOPLE SAY 

230
00:07:13,332 --> 00:07:20,406
THAT -- YOU KNOW, YOU HAVE SAID 

231
00:07:20,406 --> 00:07:21,440
-- YOU ARE CONSIDERING THAT 

232
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:22,241
MAYBE YOU NEED MORE 

233
00:07:22,241 --> 00:07:22,574

234
00:07:22,574 --> 00:07:23,876
WHAT WE THINK IS THAT WE NEED 

235
00:07:23,876 --> 00:07:25,511
FOR YOU TO LOOK AT NEW 

236
00:07:25,511 --> 00:07:26,512
LEGISLATION AND YOU ARE HEARING 

237
00:07:26,512 --> 00:07:28,281
THAT THERE WILL BE MORE BILLS 

238
00:07:28,281 --> 00:07:37,490
RIGHT OUT IN THE NEXT FEW WEEKS 

239
00:07:37,490 --> 00:07:38,891
BUT WE HAVE HAD A BILL, THE 

240
00:07:38,891 --> 00:07:39,325
BROWSER ACT. 

241
00:07:39,325 --> 00:07:40,726
AND I AM CERTAIN THAT YOU ARE 

242
00:07:40,726 --> 00:07:41,360
FAMILIAR WITH THIS. 

243
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:42,562
IT IS BIPARTISAN AND I THINK 

244
00:07:42,562 --> 00:07:43,829
MR. LAPINSKI AND MR. LANTZ AND 

245
00:07:43,829 --> 00:07:45,598
MR. FLOREZ FOR THEIR WORK ON

THIS LEGISLATION. 

247
00:07:50,703 --> 00:07:52,104
WE HAVE HEADED FOR OVER A YEAR 

248
00:07:52,104 --> 00:07:53,105
AND CERTAINLY, WE HAVE BEEN 

249
00:07:53,105 --> 00:07:54,340
WORKING ON THIS ISSUE FOR ABOUT 

250
00:07:54,340 --> 00:07:54,740
FOUR YEARS. 

251
00:07:54,740 --> 00:07:56,175
WHAT THIS WOULD DO IS HAVE ONE 

252
00:07:56,175 --> 00:07:57,376
REGULATOR, ONE SET OF RULES FOR 

253
00:07:57,376 --> 00:07:58,010
THE ENTIRE ECOSYSTEM. 

254
00:07:58,010 --> 00:07:59,211
AND WILL YOU COMMIT TO WORKING 

255
00:07:59,211 --> 00:08:01,747
WITH US TO PASS PRIVACY 

256
00:08:01,747 --> 00:08:09,388
LEGISLATION? 

257
00:08:09,388 --> 00:08:10,389
TO PASS THE BROWSER ACT? 

258
00:08:10,389 --> 00:08:11,490
WILL YOU COMMIT TO DOING THAT? 

259
00:08:11,490 --> 00:08:12,425
>> CONGRESSWOMAN, I AM NOT

262

THE DETAILS. 

266

AS YOU HAVE HEARD, WE NEED SOME 

267
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:28,507
RULES AND REGULATIONS. 

268
00:08:28,507 --> 00:08:29,475
THIS IS ONLY 13 PAGES. 

269
00:08:29,475 --> 00:08:35,581
THE BROWSER ACT IS 13 PHASES -- 

270
00:08:35,581 --> 00:08:36,782
PAGES AND YOU CAN EASILY BECOME 

271
00:08:36,782 --> 00:08:38,017
FAMILIAR WITH IT AND WE WOULD

00:08:38,017 --> 00:08:38,618
APPRECIATE YOUR HELP. 

273
00:08:38,618 --> 00:08:40,251

YOU'RE DOING EVERYTHING YOU 

278
00:08:44,523 --> 00:08:45,725
CLAIM BECAUSE YOU WILL HAVE TO 

279
00:08:45,725 --> 00:08:46,759
ALLOW CONSUMERS TO CONTROL 

280
00:08:46,759 --> 00:08:47,960
THEIR DATA, TO CHANGE, TO ERASE 

281
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:48,160
IT. 

282
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:50,629
YOU HAVE TO GIVE CONSUMERS OPT 

283
00:08:50,629 --> 00:08:54,900

I WANT TO MOVE ON AND ASK YOU 

290
00:09:06,012 --> 00:09:07,680

CENSORING SPEECH. 

311
00:09:47,286 --> 00:09:48,521
THERE ARE TYPES OF CONTENT LIKE 

312
00:09:48,521 --> 00:09:49,755
TERRORISM THAT I THINK WE ALL 

313
00:09:49,755 --> 00:09:51,323
AGREE WE DO NOT WANT TO HAVE ON 

314

OUR SERVICE. 

315
00:09:51,757 --> 00:09:52,958
SO WE BUILT SYSTEMS THAT CAN 

316
00:09:52,958 --> 00:09:53,993
IDENTIFY THOSE AND CAN REMOVE 

317
00:09:53,993 --> 00:09:55,194
THAT CONTENT AND WE ARE VERY 

318
00:09:55,194 --> 00:09:55,895

WE ARE TRYING TO EXPLORE WHAT 

343
00:10:36,669 --> 00:10:37,870
WE CAN DO TO PREVENT FURTHER 

344
00:10:37,870 --> 00:10:38,137
BREACHES. 

345
00:10:38,137 --> 00:10:40,239

NOTICED A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE 

370
00:11:30,055 --> 00:11:31,323
IN USERS DEACTIVATING THEIR

373
00:11:38,430 --> 00:11:39,031
>> SINCE THE REVELATIONS 

374
00:11:39,031 --> 00:11:41,767
SURROUNDING CAMBRIDGE ANALYTICA,

375
00:11:41,767 --> 00:11:43,102
FACEBOOK HAS ALSO NOT NOTICED A 

376
00:11:43,102 --> 00:11:44,536
DECREASE IN USER INTERACTION ON 

377
00:11:44,536 --> 00:11:53,178
FACEBOOK; CORRECT? 

378
00:11:53,178 --> 00:11:53,979
>> YES, THAT IS CORRECT. 

379
00:11:53,979 --> 00:11:54,246
>> OKAY. 

380
00:11:54,246 --> 00:11:55,848
NOW, I WANT TO TAKE A MINUTE TO 

381
00:11:55,848 --> 00:11:57,082
TALK ABOUT SOME OF THE CIVIL 

382
00:11:57,082 --> 00:11:57,883
AND REGULATORY PENALTIES THAT 

383
00:11:57,883 --> 00:11:58,484
WE ARE SEEING. 

384
00:11:58,484 --> 00:11:59,751
I AM AWARE OF TWO CLASS-ACTION 

385
00:11:59,751 --> 00:12:00,952
LAWSUITS THAT FACEBOOK HAS 

386
00:12:00,952 --> 00:12:07,426
SETTLED RELATING TO PRIVACY 

387
00:12:07,426 --> 00:12:07,693
CONCERNS. 

388

LANE VERSUS FACEBOOK WAS 

389
00:12:08,460 --> 00:12:09,061
SETTLED IN 2010. 

390
00:12:09,061 --> 00:12:10,296
THAT CASE RESULTED IN NO MONEY 

391
00:12:10,296 --> 00:12:17,636
BEING AWARDED TO FACEBOOK USERS

392
00:12:17,636 --> 00:12:18,370

393
00:12:18,370 --> 00:12:19,205
>> CONGRESSWOMAN, I AM NOT

FAMILIAR WITH THE DETAILS OF

>> YES. 

399
00:12:22,340 --> 00:12:23,075
>> THIS MAJOR LAWSUIT WAS 

400
00:12:23,075 --> 00:12:23,342
SETTLED. 

401
00:12:23,342 --> 00:12:26,846
DO YOU KNOW ABOUT THE LAWSUIT?  

402
00:12:26,846 --> 00:12:27,947
>>  CONGRESSWOMAN, I GET 

403
00:12:27,947 --> 00:12:30,649
BRIEFED ON THESE  -- 

404

>> I CAN TELL YOU THAT THERE 

410
00:12:47,900 --> 00:12:49,301
WAS A LAWSUIT AND THE USERS GOT 

411
00:12:49,301 --> 00:12:49,568
NOTHING. 

412
00:12:49,568 --> 00:12:50,536
IN ANOTHER CASE, FREELY VERSUS 

413
00:12:50,536 --> 00:12:51,704
FACEBOOK, IT RESULTED IN A 2013 

414
00:12:51,704 --> 00:12:52,738
SETTLEMENT FUND OF $20 MILLION 

415
00:12:52,738 --> 00:12:53,739

USERS BEGINNINGIN 2016, IS 

418
00:13:07,953 --> 00:13:08,320
THAT CORRECT?

FAMILIAR WITH IT. 

421

>> YOU DON'T KNOW ABOUT THAT 

422
00:13:10,823 --> 00:13:11,156
WHEN EITHER? 

423
00:13:11,156 --> 00:13:12,224
>> I DON'T REMEMBER THE EXACT 

424
00:13:12,224 --> 00:13:12,491
DETAILS. 

425
00:13:12,491 --> 00:13:12,757
>> OKAY. 

426
00:13:12,757 --> 00:13:14,059
AS THE RESULT OF THE 2011 FTC 

427
00:13:14,059 --> 00:13:14,693
INVESTIGATION INTO FACEBOOK'S 

428
00:13:14,693 --> 00:13:15,694
PRIVACY POLICY, DO YOU KNOW 

429
00:13:15,694 --> 00:13:16,862
ABOUT THAT ONE?   

430
00:13:16,862 --> 00:13:18,364
>>  THE FTC INVESTIGATION? 

431
00:13:18,364 --> 00:13:18,564
YES. 

432
00:13:18,564 --> 00:13:21,400
>> YOU ENTERED INTO A DISSENT  

433
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:22,635
AGREE WITH THE FTC WHICH CARRY 

434
00:13:22,635 --> 00:13:23,435
NO FINANCIAL PENALTIES FOR 

435
00:13:23,435 --> 00:13:32,144
FACEBOOK, IS THAT CORRECT?    

436
00:13:32,144 --> 00:13:33,145
>>  CONGRESSWOMAN, I DON'T 

437
00:13:33,145 --> 00:13:34,380
REMEMBER IF WE HAD A FINANCIAL 

438
00:13:34,380 --> 00:13:34,647
PENALTY. 

439
00:13:34,647 --> 00:13:35,781
>> YOU ARE THE CEO OF THE 

440
00:13:35,781 --> 00:13:37,016
COMPANY AND YOU ENTERED INTO A 

441
00:13:37,016 --> 00:13:38,017
DISSENT DECREE AND YOU DON'T 

442
00:13:38,017 --> 00:13:39,618
REMEMBER IF YOU HAD A  

443
00:13:39,618 --> 00:13:40,886
FINANCIAL DECREE. 

444
00:13:40,886 --> 00:13:41,353
>> -- 

445
00:13:41,353 --> 00:13:42,488
>> I WOULD THINK A FINANCIAL 

446
00:13:42,488 --> 00:13:43,756
PENALTY WOULD, AS WELL? 

447
00:13:43,756 --> 00:13:45,758
OKAY. 

448
00:13:45,758 --> 00:13:46,759
THE REASON YOU PROBABLY DON'T 

449
00:13:46,759 --> 00:13:47,993
REMEMBER IT IS BECAUSE THE FTC 

450
00:13:47,993 --> 00:13:53,098
DOESN'T HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO 

451
00:13:53,098 --> 00:13:53,899
ISSUE FINANCIAL PENALTIES FOR 

452
00:13:53,899 --> 00:13:54,399
FIRST-TIME VIOLATIONS. 

453
00:13:54,399 --> 00:13:55,534
THE REASON I AM ASKING THESE 

454
00:13:55,534 --> 00:13:56,568
QUESTIONS, SIR, IS BECAUSE WE 

455
00:13:56,568 --> 00:13:58,003
CONTINUE TO HAVE THESE ABUSES 

456
00:13:58,003 --> 00:14:03,642
AND THESE DATA BREACHES BUT AT 

457
00:14:03,642 --> 00:14:05,277
THE SAME TIME, IT DOESN'T SEEM 

458
00:14:05,277 --> 00:14:08,914
LIKE FUTURE ACTIVITIES ARE 

459
00:14:08,914 --> 00:14:09,214
PREVENTED. 

460
00:14:09,214 --> 00:14:10,549
SO I THINK ONE OF THE THINGS 

461
00:14:10,549 --> 00:14:15,821
THAT WE NEED TO LOOK AT IN THE 

462
00:14:15,821 --> 00:14:17,222
FUTURE AS WE WORK WITH YOU AND 

463
00:14:17,222 --> 00:14:18,257
OTHERS IN THE INDUSTRY IS 

464
00:14:18,257 --> 00:14:19,058
PUTTING ROBUST PENALTIES IN 

465
00:14:19,058 --> 00:14:25,797
PLACE IN CASE OF IMPROPER 

466
00:14:25,797 --> 00:14:26,064
ACTIONS. 

467
00:14:26,064 --> 00:14:27,232
THAT IS WHY I ASKED THESE 

468
00:14:27,232 --> 00:14:27,532
QUESTIONS. 

469
00:14:27,532 --> 00:14:28,233
>> THE CHAIR RECOGNIZES THE 

470
00:14:28,233 --> 00:14:29,034
GENTLEMAN FROM LOUISIANA, THE 

471
00:14:29,034 --> 00:14:33,838
WHIP OF THE HOUSE, MR. SCALISE. 

472
00:14:33,838 --> 00:14:34,907
>> THANK YOU MR. CHAIRMAN AND 

473
00:14:34,907 --> 00:14:35,707
MR. ZUCKERBERG, I APPRECIATE 

474
00:14:35,707 --> 00:14:36,342
YOU COMING HERE. 

475
00:14:36,342 --> 00:14:40,179
AS SOME OF MY OTHER COLLEAGUES 

476
00:14:40,179 --> 00:14:40,980
MENTIONED, YOU CAME HERE 

477
00:14:40,980 --> 00:14:41,914
VOLUNTARILY TO HAVE THIS 

478
00:14:41,914 --> 00:14:42,514
DISCUSSION BECAUSE CLEARLY, 

479
00:14:42,514 --> 00:14:43,649
WHAT YOUR COMPANY HAS BEEN ABLE 

480
00:14:43,649 --> 00:14:44,850
TO DO IS REVOLUTIONIZE THE WAY 

481
00:14:44,850 --> 00:14:46,051
PEOPLE CAN CONNECT AND THERE IS 

482
00:14:46,051 --> 00:14:47,519
A TREMENDOUS BENEFIT TO OUR 

483
00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:50,522
COUNTRY, NOW IT IS A WORLDWIDE 

484
00:14:50,522 --> 00:14:52,124
PLATFORM AND IT IS CREATING 

485
00:14:52,124 --> 00:14:58,297
SHORTAGES OF COMPUTER 

486
00:14:58,297 --> 00:14:58,630
PROGRAMMERS. 

487
00:14:58,630 --> 00:14:59,498
AS A COMPUTER PROGRAMMER, I 

488
00:14:59,498 --> 00:15:00,733
THINK WE WOULD BOTH AGREE THAT 

489
00:15:00,733 --> 00:15:01,734
WE NEED TO ENCOURAGE MORE 

490
00:15:01,734 --> 00:15:03,468
PEOPLE TO GO INTO THE COMMUTER 

491
00:15:03,468 --> 00:15:04,770
SCIENCES BECAUSE OUR COUNTRY IS 

492
00:15:04,770 --> 00:15:05,971
A WORLD LEADER THINGS TO YOUR 

493
00:15:05,971 --> 00:15:07,206
COMPANY AND SO MANY OTHERS BUT 

494
00:15:07,206 --> 00:15:09,041
IT OBVIOUSLY RAISES QUESTIONS 

495
00:15:09,041 --> 00:15:10,242
ABOUT PRIVACY AND DATA AND HOW 

496
00:15:10,242 --> 00:15:11,677
THE DATA IS SHARED AND WHAT IS 

497
00:15:11,677 --> 00:15:12,678
THE USER'S EXPECTATION OF WHERE 

498
00:15:12,678 --> 00:15:17,950
THE DATA GOES? 

499
00:15:17,950 --> 00:15:19,385
SO I WANT TO ASK A FEW 

500
00:15:19,385 --> 00:15:19,685
QUESTIONS. 

501
00:15:19,685 --> 00:15:20,819
FIRST, DO YOU AGREE THAT WE 

502
00:15:20,819 --> 00:15:21,620
NEED MORE COMPUTER PROGRAMMERS 

503
00:15:21,620 --> 00:15:23,389
AND PEOPLE TO GO INTO THAT 

504
00:15:23,389 --> 00:15:24,256
FIELD? 

505
00:15:24,256 --> 00:15:24,723
>> CONGRESSMAN, YES. 

506
00:15:24,723 --> 00:15:25,691
>> THAT IS A PUBLIC SERVICE 

507
00:15:25,691 --> 00:15:26,692
ANNOUNCEMENT THAT WE JUST MADE 

508
00:15:26,692 --> 00:15:28,494
AND I APPRECIATE YOU JOINING ME 

509
00:15:28,494 --> 00:15:29,328
IN THAT. 

510
00:15:29,328 --> 00:15:30,562
AND THE QUESTION WAS REALLY A 

511
00:15:30,562 --> 00:15:31,397
FOLLOW-UP QUESTION TO YOU 

512
00:15:31,397 --> 00:15:32,398
YESTERDAY THAT YOU WERE NOT 

513
00:15:32,398 --> 00:15:33,632
ABLE TO ANSWER BUT IT WAS, 

514
00:15:33,632 --> 00:15:35,000
DEALING WITH HOW FACEBOOK 

515
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,302
TRACKS USERS. ESPECIALLY, AFTER 

516
00:15:37,302 --> 00:15:37,870
THEY LOG OFF. 

517
00:15:37,870 --> 00:15:39,438
AND YOU HAD SAID IN 

518
00:15:39,438 --> 00:15:47,413
RELATIONSHIP TO THE 

519
00:15:47,413 --> 00:15:48,013
CONGRESSMAN'S QUESTION THAT 

520
00:15:48,013 --> 00:15:49,248
THERE IS DATA MINING BUT IT 

521
00:15:49,248 --> 00:15:50,248
GOES ON FOR SECURITY PURPOSES. 

522
00:15:50,248 --> 00:15:51,483
SO MY QUESTION WOULD BE, IS 

523
00:15:51,483 --> 00:15:52,684
THAT DATA THAT IS MINED FOR 

524
00:15:52,684 --> 00:15:53,719
SECURITY PURPOSES ALSO USED TO 

525
00:15:53,719 --> 00:15:54,920
SELL AS PART OF THE BUSINESS 

526
00:15:54,920 --> 00:15:55,687
MODEL?   

527
00:15:55,687 --> 00:15:57,523
>>  CONGRESSMAN, I BELIEVE 

528
00:15:57,523 --> 00:15:59,825
THOSE ARE  -- THAT WE COLLECT 

529
00:15:59,825 --> 00:16:01,026
DIFFERENT DATA FOR THOSE BUT I 

530
00:16:01,026 --> 00:16:02,861
CAN FOLLOW UP ON THE DETAILS OF 

531
00:16:02,861 --> 00:16:07,199
IT. 

532
00:16:07,199 --> 00:16:07,766
>> ALL RIGHT. 

533
00:16:07,766 --> 00:16:09,001
IF YOU COULD FOLLOW-UP, I WOULD 

534
00:16:09,001 --> 00:16:09,401
APPRECIATE THAT. 

535
00:16:09,401 --> 00:16:10,602
GETTING INTO THIS NEW REALM OF 

536
00:16:10,602 --> 00:16:11,603
CONTENT REVIEW, I KNOW THAT 

537
00:16:11,603 --> 00:16:16,475
SOME OF THE PEOPLE THAT WORK 

538
00:16:16,475 --> 00:16:17,276
FOR FACEBOOK, CAMPBELL BROWN, 

539
00:16:17,276 --> 00:16:18,510
FOR EXAMPLE -- THIS IS CHANGING 

540
00:16:18,510 --> 00:16:19,111
OUR RELATIONSHIP WITH 

541
00:16:19,111 --> 00:16:19,911
PUBLISHERS AND FACING SOMETHING 

542
00:16:19,911 --> 00:16:20,946
FACEBOOK HAS NEVER DONE BEFORE 

543
00:16:20,946 --> 00:16:22,981
-- IT IS HAVING A POINT OF VIEW

544
00:16:22,981 --> 00:16:25,150
. AND YOU MENTIONED THE DIAMOND 

545
00:16:25,150 --> 00:16:25,417
 

546
00:16:25,417 --> 00:16:26,618
DESCRIBED IT AS A MISTAKE WHERE 

547
00:16:26,618 --> 00:16:27,653
THE PEOPLE WHO MADE THAT 

548
00:16:27,653 --> 00:16:29,221
MISTAKE HELD ACCOUNTABLE IN ANY 

549
00:16:29,221 --> 00:16:33,325
WAY -- OR THE PEOPLE OF THAT 

550
00:16:33,325 --> 00:16:34,759
MISTAKE HELD ACCOUNTABLE IN ANY 

551
00:16:34,759 --> 00:16:43,102
WAY?    

552
00:16:43,102 --> 00:16:44,336
>>  CONGRESSMAN, LET ME FOLLOW 

553
00:16:44,336 --> 00:16:44,903
UP ON THAT. 

554
00:16:44,903 --> 00:16:46,271
I AM NOT AWARE OF THE DETAILS. 

555
00:16:46,271 --> 00:16:47,940
>> I DO WANT TO ASK YOU ABOUT A 

556
00:16:47,940 --> 00:16:48,974
STUDY THAT WAS DONE DEALING 

557
00:16:48,974 --> 00:16:49,775
WITH THE ALGORITHM THAT 

558
00:16:49,775 --> 00:16:51,009
FACEBOOK USES  TO DESCRIBE WHAT 

559
00:16:51,009 --> 00:16:52,211
IS FED TO PEOPLE THROUGH THE 

560
00:16:52,211 --> 00:16:53,212
NEWSFEED AND WHAT THEY FOUND 

561
00:16:53,212 --> 00:16:54,246
WAS, AFTER THIS NEW ALGORITHM 

562
00:16:54,246 --> 00:16:55,247
WAS IMPLEMENTED, THAT THERE WAS 

563
00:16:55,247 --> 00:16:56,882
A TREMENDOUS BIASED -- BIAS 

564
00:16:56,882 --> 00:17:15,000
AGAINST NEWS AND CONTENT AND A 

565
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:15,834
FAVORABLE BIAS TOWARD LIBERAL 

566
00:17:15,834 --> 00:17:17,035
CONTENT AND IF YOU LOOK AT 

567
00:17:17,035 --> 00:17:18,203
THAT, THAT SHOWS A 16 POINT 

568
00:17:18,203 --> 00:17:19,037
DISPARITY WHICH IS CONCERNING. 

569
00:17:19,037 --> 00:17:20,239
I WOULD IMAGINE THAT YOU'RE NOT 

570
00:17:20,239 --> 00:17:21,473
GOING TO WANT TO SHARE THE 

571
00:17:21,473 --> 00:17:22,273
ALGORITHM, ITSELF, WITH US. 

572
00:17:22,273 --> 00:17:23,509
I WOULD ENCOURAGE YOU IF YOU 

573
00:17:23,509 --> 00:17:24,710
WANTED TO DO THAT BUT WHO 

574
00:17:24,710 --> 00:17:25,310
DEVELOPS THE ALGORITHM? 

575
00:17:25,310 --> 00:17:26,345
I WROTE ALGORITHMS BEFORE AND 

576
00:17:26,345 --> 00:17:27,346
YOU CAN DETERMINE WHETHER OR 

577
00:17:27,346 --> 00:17:28,580
NOT YOU WANT TO WRITE AN 

578
00:17:28,580 --> 00:17:34,686
ALGORITHM TO SORT DATA, TO 

579
00:17:34,686 --> 00:17:35,487
COMPARTMENTALIZE DATA BUT YOU 

580
00:17:35,487 --> 00:17:37,089
CAN ALSO PUT IN A BIAS IF THAT 

581
00:17:37,089 --> 00:17:37,723
IS A DIRECTIVE. 

582
00:17:37,723 --> 00:17:38,924
WAS THERE A DIRECTIVE TO PUT 

583
00:17:38,924 --> 00:17:39,558
THE BIAS IN? 

584
00:17:39,558 --> 00:17:40,759
FIRST, ARE YOU AWARE OF THIS 

585
00:17:40,759 --> 00:17:41,793
BIAS THAT MANY PEOPLE HAVE 

586
00:17:41,793 --> 00:17:42,794
LOOKED AT AND ANALYZED AND 

587
00:17:42,794 --> 00:17:43,562
SEEN?   

588
00:17:43,562 --> 00:17:44,863
>>  CONGRESSMAN, THIS IS A 

589
00:17:44,863 --> 00:17:45,664
REALLY IMPORTANT QUESTION . 

590
00:17:45,664 --> 00:17:46,465
THERE IS ABSOLUTELY NO 

591
00:17:46,465 --> 00:17:50,736
DIRECTIVE IN ANY OF THE CHANGES 

592
00:17:50,736 --> 00:17:52,137
WE MADE TO HAVE A BIAS IN 

593
00:17:52,137 --> 00:17:52,738
ANYTHING WE DO. 

594
00:17:52,738 --> 00:17:53,372
TO THE CONTRARY. 

595
00:17:53,372 --> 00:17:54,773
OUR GOAL IS TO BE A PLATFORM 

596
00:17:54,773 --> 00:17:55,307
FOR ALL IDEAS. 

597
00:17:55,307 --> 00:18:02,080
>> WE ARE ALMOST OUT OF TIME. 

598
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:03,315
IF YOU CAN GO BACK AND 

599
00:18:03,315 --> 00:18:04,516
DETERMINE IF THERE WAS A BIAS, 

600
00:18:04,516 --> 00:18:05,451
WHOEVER DEVELOPED THAT SOFTWARE 

601
00:18:05,451 --> 00:18:06,552
DOES YOU HAVE 20,000 PEOPLE WHO 

602
00:18:06,552 --> 00:18:07,586
DEVELOP THIS DATA ANALYSIS -- 

603
00:18:07,586 --> 00:18:08,987
IF YOU COULD LOOK AND SEE IF 

604
00:18:08,987 --> 00:18:10,622
THERE IS A BIAS AND LET US KNOW 

605
00:18:10,622 --> 00:18:12,024
IF THERE IS AND WHAT YOU ARE 

606
00:18:12,024 --> 00:18:13,258
DOING ABOUT IT BECAUSE THAT IS 

607
00:18:13,258 --> 00:18:14,259
DISTURBING WHEN YOU SEE THAT 

608
00:18:14,259 --> 00:18:14,893
KIND OF DISPARITY. 

609
00:18:14,893 --> 00:18:16,094
FINALLY, THERE HAS BEEN A LOT 

610
00:18:16,094 --> 00:18:17,129
OF TALK ABOUT CAMBRIDGE AND 

611
00:18:17,129 --> 00:18:21,233
WHAT THEY HAVE DONE IN THE LAST 

612
00:18:21,233 --> 00:18:21,500
CAMPAIGN. 

613
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:22,634
IN 2008 AND 2012, THERE WAS 

614
00:18:22,634 --> 00:18:23,869
ALSO A LOT OF THIS DONE. 

615
00:18:23,869 --> 00:18:27,472
ONE OF THE LEAD DIGITAL HEADS 

616
00:18:27,472 --> 00:18:28,507
OF THE OBAMA CAMPAIGN SAID, 

617
00:18:28,507 --> 00:18:29,107
RECENTLY, FACEBOOK WAS 

618
00:18:29,107 --> 00:18:30,309
SURPRISED WE WERE ABLE TO SUCK 

619
00:18:30,309 --> 00:18:36,415
OUT THE WHOLE SOCIAL GRAPH THAT 

620
00:18:36,415 --> 00:18:37,849
THEY DID NOT STOP US ONCE THEY 

621
00:18:37,849 --> 00:18:39,051
REALIZED THAT WAS WHAT WE WERE 

622
00:18:39,051 --> 00:18:39,284
DOING. 

623
00:18:39,284 --> 00:18:40,686
THEY CAME TO THE OFFICE IN THE 

624
00:18:40,686 --> 00:18:41,687
DAYS FOLLOWING THE ELECTION IN 

625
00:18:41,687 --> 00:18:42,721
RECRUITED AND WERE CANDID THAT 

626
00:18:42,721 --> 00:18:49,828
THEY ALLOWED US TO DO THINGS 

627
00:18:49,828 --> 00:18:51,096
THEY WOULD NOT ALLOW OTHERS TO 

628
00:18:51,096 --> 00:18:52,297
DO BECAUSE THEY WERE ON OUR 

629
00:18:52,297 --> 00:18:52,497
SIDE. 

630
00:18:52,497 --> 00:18:53,932
THAT IS A DIRECT QUOTE FROM ONE 

631
00:18:53,932 --> 00:18:55,133
OF THE HEADS OF THE OBAMA 

632
00:18:55,133 --> 00:18:55,534
DIGITAL TEAM. 

633
00:18:55,534 --> 00:18:58,370
WHAT DID SHE MEAN BY THAT, 

634
00:18:58,370 --> 00:18:59,271
FACEBOOK, WERE ON OUR SIDE? 

635
00:18:59,271 --> 00:19:00,172
>> CONGRESSMAN, WE DID NOT 

636
00:19:00,172 --> 00:19:01,839
ALLOW THE OBAMA CAMPAIGN TO DO 

637
00:19:01,839 --> 00:19:03,442
ANYTHING THAT ANYONE ELSE ON 

638
00:19:03,442 --> 00:19:04,443
THE PLATFORM WOULD NOT HAVE 

639
00:19:04,443 --> 00:19:13,018
BEEN ABLE TO DO. 

640
00:19:13,018 --> 00:19:13,985
>> THAT IS AN INACCURATE 

641
00:19:13,985 --> 00:19:14,886
STATEMENT IN YOUR OPINION? 

642
00:19:14,886 --> 00:19:15,119
>> YES. 

643
00:19:15,119 --> 00:19:15,821

WHEN THE GUARDIAN MADE THE

677
00:20:11,476 --> 00:20:16,614
I GENERALLY THINK THAT -- 

678
00:20:16,614 --> 00:20:18,183
>> -- LET ME ASK YOU THIS: YOU 

679
00:20:18,183 --> 00:20:25,090
HAD THE CAPABILITY OF ALTERING

681
00:20:26,325 --> 00:20:27,526
TO PREVENT THESE ABUSES BUT THE 

682
00:20:27,526 --> 00:20:28,560
PROBLEM THAT FACEBOOK NOT ONLY 

683
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:34,266
PERSISTED BUT PROLIFERATED. 

684
00:20:34,266 --> 00:20:35,267
IN FACT, RELATIVE TO OTHER 

685
00:20:35,267 --> 00:20:36,501
TYPES OF PROBLEMS THAT YOU HAD 

686
00:20:36,501 --> 00:20:37,736
ON YOUR PLATFORM, IT SEEMS AS 

687
00:20:37,736 --> 00:20:38,904
THOUGH YOU TURNED A BLIND EYE 

688
00:20:38,904 --> 00:20:40,037

THAT ASSESSMENT. 

691

I DO THINK THAT GOING FORWARD, 

692
00:20:42,641 --> 00:20:43,775
WE NEED TO TAKE A MORE 

693
00:20:43,775 --> 00:20:45,344

696
00:20:58,590 --> 00:20:59,825
WE HAVE HAD A PROCESS, WE 

697

NUMBER OF PRACTICES THAT

722
00:21:41,900 --> 00:21:43,135

723
00:21:43,135 --> 00:21:43,735
IT DID NOT. 

724
00:21:43,735 --> 00:21:44,769
AND ENABLE DEVELOPERS TO ACCESS

00:22:06,257 --> 00:22:09,294
PARTNERED WITH INDIVIDUALS SUCH 

742
00:22:09,294 --> 00:22:10,295
AS ALEKSANDR KOGAN WE TURNED 

743
00:22:10,295 --> 00:22:11,563
AROUND AND SOLD THAT DATA ON 

744
00:22:11,563 --> 00:22:12,564
THE OPEN MARKET AND TO 

745
00:22:12,564 --> 00:22:13,698
COMPANIES LIKE CAMBRIDGE 

746
00:22:13,698 --> 00:22:17,469
ANALYTICA. MR. ZUCKERBERG, YOU 

747
00:22:17,469 --> 00:22:18,637
HAVE SAID THAT YOU PLAN TO 

748
00:22:18,637 --> 00:22:19,638
AUDIT TENS OF THOUSANDS OF 

749
00:22:19,638 --> 00:22:21,239
DEVELOPERS THAT MAY HAVE BEEN 

750
00:22:21,239 --> 00:22:22,307
PROPERLY HARVESTED FACEBOOK 

751
00:22:22,307 --> 00:22:22,707
USER DATA. 

752
00:22:22,707 --> 00:22:24,109
YOU ALSO SAID THAT YOU PLAN TO 

753
00:22:24,109 --> 00:22:25,677
GIVE ALL FACEBOOK USERS ACCESS 

754
00:22:25,677 --> 00:22:27,979
TO SOME USER CONTROLS THAT WILL 

755
00:22:27,979 --> 00:22:29,181
BE MADE AVAILABLE IN THE EU 

756
00:22:29,181 --> 00:22:34,686
UNDER THE GDP ARE. 

757
00:22:34,686 --> 00:22:36,121
BUT IT STRIKES ME THAT THERE IS 

758
00:22:36,121 --> 00:22:37,122
A REAL TRUST GAP, HERE. 

759
00:22:37,122 --> 00:22:38,123
THIS DEVELOPER DATA ISSUE IS 

760
00:22:38,123 --> 00:22:42,794
JUST ONE EXAMPLE. 

761
00:22:42,794 --> 00:22:44,229
BUT WHY SHOULD WE TRUST YOU TO 

762
00:22:44,229 --> 00:22:45,063
FOLLOW THROUGH ON THESE 

763
00:22:45,063 --> 00:22:45,897
PROMISES WHEN YOU HAVE 

764
00:22:45,897 --> 00:22:46,531
DEMONSTRATED REPEATEDLY THAT 

765
00:22:46,531 --> 00:22:47,732
YOU ARE WILLING TO LAUNCH YOUR 

766
00:22:47,732 --> 00:22:48,333
INTERNAL POLICIES AND 

767
00:22:48,333 --> 00:22:49,134
GOVERNMENT OVERSIGHT WHEN THE 

768
00:22:49,134 --> 00:22:57,242
NEED SUITS YOU. 

769
00:22:57,242 --> 00:22:58,343
>> CONGRESSMAN, RESPECTFULLY, I 

770
00:22:58,343 --> 00:22:58,776
DISAGREE WITH THAT 

771
00:22:58,776 --> 00:22:59,177
CHARACTERIZATION. 

772
00:22:59,177 --> 00:23:00,078
WE HAVE HAD A REVIEW PROCESS 

773
00:23:00,078 --> 00:23:05,150
FOR APPS, FOUR YEARS. 

774
00:23:05,150 --> 00:23:06,184
WE HAVE REVIEWED TENS OF 

775
00:23:06,184 --> 00:23:07,385
THOUSANDS OF APPS PER YEAR AND 

776
00:23:07,385 --> 00:23:08,386
TAKEN ACTION AGAINST A NUMBER 

777
00:23:08,386 --> 00:23:08,820
OF THEM. 

778
00:23:08,820 --> 00:23:10,021
OUR PROCESS WAS NOT ENOUGH TO 

779
00:23:10,021 --> 00:23:16,728
CATCH A DEVELOPER.    

780
00:23:16,728 --> 00:23:18,396
>>  MY TIME IS ALMOST OVER AND 

781
00:23:18,396 --> 00:23:19,998
I JUST WANT TO SAY THAT TO MY 

782
00:23:19,998 --> 00:23:21,433
MIND, THE ONLY WAY WE ARE GOING 

783
00:23:21,433 --> 00:23:22,868
TO CLOSE THIS TRUST GAP IS THE 

784
00:23:22,868 --> 00:23:23,869
LEGISLATION THAT CREATES  A 

785
00:23:23,869 --> 00:23:24,503
SUFFICIENTLY RESOURCE EXPERT 

786
00:23:24,503 --> 00:23:25,070
OVERSIGHT AGENCY WITH 

787
00:23:25,070 --> 00:23:25,871
RULEMAKING AUTHORITY TO PROTECT 

788
00:23:25,871 --> 00:23:26,872
THE DIGITAL PRIVACY AND ENSURE 

789
00:23:26,872 --> 00:23:28,240
THAT COMPANIES PROTECT OUR 

790
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:30,342
USERS DATA. 

791
00:23:30,342 --> 00:23:30,842
I YIELD BACK. 

792
00:23:30,842 --> 00:23:31,743
>> THE GENTLEMAN'S TIME HAS 

793
00:23:31,743 --> 00:23:32,511
EXPIRED. 

794
00:23:32,511 --> 00:23:39,084
WE RECOGNIZE MR. LATTA OF OHIO 

795
00:23:39,084 --> 00:23:39,650
FOR FOUR MINUTES. 

796
00:23:39,650 --> 00:23:41,253
>> THANK YOU, MR. CHAIRMAN AND 

797
00:23:41,253 --> 00:23:46,191
MR. ZUCKERBERG, TAKE YOU SO 

798
00:23:46,191 --> 00:23:47,392
MUCH FOR BEING WITH US TODAY. 

799
00:23:47,392 --> 00:23:48,627
THE FIRST QUESTION I HAVE IS, 

800
00:23:48,627 --> 00:23:49,828
CAN YOU TELL THE FACEBOOK USERS 

801
00:23:49,828 --> 00:23:50,862
THAT THE RUSSIANS AND THE 

802
00:23:50,862 --> 00:23:52,097
CHINESE HAVE NOT USED AS A 

803
00:23:52,097 --> 00:23:53,131
METHOD AS OTHER PARTIES -- 

804
00:23:53,131 --> 00:24:00,071
THIRD PARTIES FOR GAIN? 

805
00:24:00,071 --> 00:24:01,006
>> CONGRESSMAN, WE HAVE NOT 

806
00:24:01,006 --> 00:24:01,572
SEEN THAT ACTIVITY. 

807
00:24:01,572 --> 00:24:02,107
>> NONE AT ALL? 

808
00:24:02,107 --> 00:24:03,874
>> NOT THAT I AM AWARE OF. 

809
00:24:03,874 --> 00:24:08,513
>> OKAY. 

810
00:24:08,513 --> 00:24:09,748
LET ME ASK THIS QUESTION: A 

811
00:24:09,748 --> 00:24:10,982
LITTLE BIT HAS BEEN GOING ON 

812
00:24:10,982 --> 00:24:11,983
WHEN YOU MADE YOUR OPENING 

813
00:24:11,983 --> 00:24:12,984
STATEMENT IN REGARDS TO WHAT 

814
00:24:12,984 --> 00:24:14,619
YOU WOULD LIKE TO SEE DONE WITH 

815
00:24:14,619 --> 00:24:15,620
THE COMPANY AND STEPS MOVING 

816
00:24:15,620 --> 00:24:15,887
FORWARD. 

817
00:24:15,887 --> 00:24:17,354
THERE'S A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS 

818
00:24:17,354 --> 00:24:25,830
ABOUT, YOU'RE GOING TO BE 

819
00:24:25,830 --> 00:24:26,431
INVESTIGATING THE APPS. 

820
00:24:26,431 --> 00:24:27,666
HOW MANY APPS ARE THERE OUT 

821
00:24:27,666 --> 00:24:28,867
THERE THAT YOU WOULD HAVE TO 

822
00:24:28,867 --> 00:24:29,200
INVESTIGATE? 

823
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:30,101
>> THERE ARE TENS OF THOUSANDS 

824
00:24:30,101 --> 00:24:31,503
OF APPS THAT HAVE ACCESS TO A 

825
00:24:31,503 --> 00:24:32,270
LARGE AMOUNT OF PEOPLE'S 

826
00:24:32,270 --> 00:24:33,604
INFORMATION BEFORE WE LOCKED 

827
00:24:33,604 --> 00:24:40,011
DOWN THE PLATFORM IN 2014. 

828
00:24:40,011 --> 00:24:41,246
WE ARE GOING TO DO AN 

829
00:24:41,246 --> 00:24:41,846
INVESTIGATION THAT FIRST 

830
00:24:41,846 --> 00:24:42,647
INVOLVES LOOKING AT THE 

831
00:24:42,647 --> 00:24:43,648
PATTERNS AND EPI ACCESS AND 

832
00:24:43,648 --> 00:24:45,083
WHAT THOSE COMPANIES WERE DOING

833
00:24:45,083 --> 00:24:46,518
. AND THEN, IF WE FIND ANYTHING 

834
00:24:46,518 --> 00:24:47,519
SUSPICIOUS, WE ARE GOING TO 

835
00:24:47,519 --> 00:24:49,154
BRING IN THIRD-PARTY AUDITORS 

836
00:24:49,154 --> 00:24:50,155
TO GO THROUGH THEIR TECHNICAL 

837
00:24:50,155 --> 00:24:50,956
AND PHYSICAL SYSTEMS TO 

838
00:24:50,956 --> 00:25:08,440
UNDERSTAND WHAT THEY DID AND IF 

839
00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:09,674
WE FIND THEY MISUSED ANY DATA, 

840
00:25:09,674 --> 00:25:10,875
WE WILL BAN THEM FROM OUR 

841
00:25:10,875 --> 00:25:11,142
PLATFORM. 

842
00:25:11,142 --> 00:25:12,310
MAKE SURE THEY DO DELETE THE 

843
00:25:12,310 --> 00:25:13,111
DATA AND TELL EVERYONE 

844
00:25:13,111 --> 00:25:13,378
AFFECTED. 

845
00:25:13,378 --> 00:25:14,346
>> JUST A FOLLOW-UP, HOW LONG 

846
00:25:14,346 --> 00:25:15,346
WOULD IT TAKE TO INVESTIGATE 

847
00:25:15,346 --> 00:25:16,781
EACH ONE OF THOSE APPS ONCE YOU 

848
00:25:16,781 --> 00:25:17,382
ARE DOING THAT? 

849
00:25:17,382 --> 00:25:18,617
YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT TENS OF 

850
00:25:18,617 --> 00:25:19,618
THOUSANDS THAT YOU'RE GOING TO 

851
00:25:19,618 --> 00:25:20,218
THAT ENTIRE PROCESS. 

852
00:25:20,218 --> 00:25:21,653
HOW LONG WOULD IT TAKE TO REACH 

853
00:25:21,653 --> 00:25:22,353
EVERYONE ON THOSE APPS? 

854
00:25:22,353 --> 00:25:23,688
>> IT WILL TAKE MANY MONTHS TO 

855
00:25:23,688 --> 00:25:24,489
DOTHIS FULL PROCESS. 

856
00:25:24,489 --> 00:25:25,924
AND IT IS GOING TO BE AN 

857
00:25:25,924 --> 00:25:27,125
EXPENSIVE PROCESS WITH A LOT OF 

858
00:25:27,125 --> 00:25:28,360
AUDITORS BUT WE THINK THIS IS 

859
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:29,761
THE RIGHT THING TO DO AT THIS 

860
00:25:29,761 --> 00:25:29,994
POINT. 

861
00:25:29,994 --> 00:25:30,996
BEFORE WE THOUGHT THAT WHEN 

862
00:25:30,996 --> 00:25:32,030
DEVELOPERS TOLD US THAT THEY 

863
00:25:32,030 --> 00:25:33,465
WERE NOT GOING TO SELL THE DATA 

864
00:25:33,465 --> 00:25:34,499
THAT THAT WAS A GOOD 

865
00:25:34,499 --> 00:25:34,866
REPRESENTATION. 

866
00:25:34,866 --> 00:25:36,101
BUT ONE OF THE BIG LESSONS WE 

867
00:25:36,101 --> 00:25:37,135
HAVE LEARNED IS THAT CLEARLY, 

868
00:25:37,135 --> 00:25:44,609
WE CANNOT JUST TAKE DEVELOPERS 

869
00:25:44,609 --> 00:25:45,210
WORD FOR IT. 

870
00:25:45,210 --> 00:25:46,645
WE NEED TO GO IN AND ENFORCE 

871
00:25:46,645 --> 00:25:46,845
THAT. 

872
00:25:46,845 --> 00:25:47,112
>> OKAY. 

873
00:25:47,112 --> 00:25:48,046
THE THING ABOUT AUDITS, THERE 

874
00:25:48,046 --> 00:25:48,880
ARE QUESTIONS ABOUT THIS. 

875
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:50,315
ON THE ON IT IN 2011, FACEBOOK 

876
00:25:50,315 --> 00:25:51,316
DID SIGN THAT DISSENT ORDER 

877
00:25:51,316 --> 00:25:52,117
WITH THE FEDERAL TRADE 

878
00:25:52,117 --> 00:25:52,917
COMMISSION FOR THE PRIVACY 

879
00:25:52,917 --> 00:25:53,217
VIOLATIONS. 

880
00:25:53,217 --> 00:25:54,953
PART OF THAT CONSENT ORDER 

881
00:25:54,953 --> 00:25:56,254
REQUIRES FACEBOOK TO SUBMIT 

882
00:25:56,254 --> 00:25:58,423
THIRD-PARTY PRIVACY AUDITS TO 

883
00:25:58,423 --> 00:26:03,495
THE FTC EVERY 32 YEARS -- EVERY 

884
00:26:03,495 --> 00:26:03,895
TWO YEARS. 

885
00:26:03,895 --> 00:26:05,163
FIRST, ARE YOU AWARE OF THE 

886
00:26:05,163 --> 00:26:06,364
AUDIENCE AND SECOND, WHY DIDN'T 

887
00:26:06,364 --> 00:26:07,365
THE AUDIT DISCLOSE OR FIND 

888
00:26:07,365 --> 00:26:11,269
THESE ISSUES WITH USERS DATA? 

889
00:26:11,269 --> 00:26:11,870
>> YES, CONGRESSMAN. 

890
00:26:11,870 --> 00:26:18,309
I AM AWARE OF THE AUDITS THAT 

891
00:26:18,309 --> 00:26:18,743
WE DO. 

892
00:26:18,743 --> 00:26:20,145
WE DO THEM EVERY OTHER YEAR AND 

893
00:26:20,145 --> 00:26:20,779
THEY ARE ONGOING. 

894
00:26:20,779 --> 00:26:22,347
THE AUDITS HAVE NOT FOUND 

895
00:26:22,347 --> 00:26:29,888
MATERIAL ISSUES. 

896
00:26:29,888 --> 00:26:30,922
I THINK THE BROADER QUESTION 

897
00:26:30,922 --> 00:26:32,323
HERE IS, WE HAVE HAD THE FTC 

898
00:26:32,323 --> 00:26:33,558
CONSENT DEGREE BUT WE TAKE A 

899
00:26:33,558 --> 00:26:34,592
BROADER VIEW OF WHAT OUR 

900
00:26:34,592 --> 00:26:35,159
RESPONSIBILITY FOR PEOPLE'S 

901
00:26:35,159 --> 00:26:35,593
úPR 

902
00:26:35,593 --> 00:26:37,228
AND, OUR VIEW IS THAT WHAT THE 

903
00:26:37,228 --> 00:26:38,029
DEVELOPER DID THAT THEY 

904
00:26:38,029 --> 00:26:43,535
REPRESENT TO US THAT THEY ARE 

905
00:26:43,535 --> 00:26:44,969
GOING TO USE THE DATA IN A 

906
00:26:44,969 --> 00:26:46,171
CERTAIN WAY AND THEN WENT OUT 

907
00:26:46,171 --> 00:26:46,771
AND SOLD IT. 

908
00:26:46,771 --> 00:26:51,643
WE DO NOT BELIEVE IT IS THE 

909
00:26:51,643 --> 00:26:52,644
VIOLATION OF THE DISSENT DECREE 

910
00:26:52,644 --> 00:26:54,079
BUT IT IS CLEARLY A BREACH OF 

911
00:26:54,079 --> 00:26:55,280
TRUST AND THE STANDARD THAT WE 

912
00:26:55,280 --> 00:26:56,514
HOLD OURSELVES TO IS NOT JUST 

913
00:26:56,514 --> 00:26:57,716
FOLLOWING THE LAWS THAT ARE IN 

914
00:26:57,716 --> 00:26:59,150
PLACE BUT WE JUST WANT TO TAKE 

915
00:26:59,150 --> 00:27:02,220
A BROADER VIEW OF THIS.>> ARE 

916
00:27:02,220 --> 00:27:03,221
YOU AWARE THAT FACEBOOK DID 

917
00:27:03,221 --> 00:27:03,821
PROVIDE THE AUDITORS 

918
00:27:03,821 --> 00:27:10,328
INFORMATION IS REQUESTED DURING 

919
00:27:10,328 --> 00:27:10,862
THE FTC AUDITS? 

920
00:27:10,862 --> 00:27:11,862
>> SORRY, CAN YOU REPEAT THAT? 

921
00:27:11,862 --> 00:27:13,598
>> DID FACEBOOK PROVIDE THE 

922
00:27:13,598 --> 00:27:15,166
AUDITORS WITH ALL OF THE

INFORMATION REQUESTED TO 

924

PREPARE FOR THE AUDIT WITH THE

>> I BELIEVE WE DO PREPARE THE 

927
00:27:28,413 --> 00:27:28,646
AUDITS. 

928
00:27:28,646 --> 00:27:29,414
>> WERE YOU ASKED PERSONAL 

929
00:27:29,414 --> 00:27:30,248
INFORMATION OR FEEDBACK IN 

930
00:27:30,248 --> 00:27:32,650
THESE AUDITS TO THE FTC?    

931
00:27:32,650 --> 00:27:33,485
>>  CONGRESSMAN, NOT 

932
00:27:33,485 --> 00:27:33,785
PERSONALLY. 

933
00:27:33,785 --> 00:27:36,721
ALTHOUGH, I AM BRIEFED  ON THE 

934
00:27:36,721 --> 00:27:37,422
AUDITS BY OUR TEAM. 

935
00:27:37,422 --> 00:27:39,991
>> MY TIME HAS EXPIRED. I GET 

936
00:27:39,991 --> 00:27:40,191

>> THE CHAIR RECOGNIZES 

938
00:27:41,359 --> 00:27:52,170
CHUDOWSKI FOR FOUR MINUTES.    

939
00:27:52,170 --> 00:27:53,371
>>  THANK YOU, MR. CHAIRMAN. 

940
00:27:53,371 --> 00:27:54,606
YOU HAVE A LONG HISTORY OF 

941
00:27:54,606 --> 00:27:55,840
GROWTH AND SUCCESS BUT YOU ALSO 

942
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:57,242
HAVE A LONG LIST OF APOLOGIES  

943
00:27:57,242 --> 00:27:59,277
IN 2003, IT STARTED, AT 

944
00:27:59,277 --> 00:27:59,544
HARVARD. 

945
00:27:59,544 --> 00:28:00,712
I APOLOGIZE FOR ANY HARM DONE 

946
00:28:00,712 --> 00:28:01,713
AS A RESULT OF MY. 

947
00:28:01,713 --> 00:28:03,347
2006, WE REALLY MISSED THIS ONE 

948
00:28:03,347 --> 00:28:17,762
UP. 2007, WE SIMPLY DID A BAD 

949
00:28:17,762 --> 00:28:17,962
JOB. 

950
00:28:17,962 --> 00:28:18,830
I APOLOGIZE FOR IT. 

951
00:28:18,830 --> 00:28:19,831
2010, SOMETIMES WE MOVE TOO 

952
00:28:19,831 --> 00:28:20,031
FAST. 

953
00:28:20,031 --> 00:28:21,432
2011, I AM THE FIRST TO ADMIT 

954
00:28:21,432 --> 00:28:22,667
THAT WE MADE A BUNCH OF 

955
00:28:22,667 --> 00:28:22,934
MISTAKES. 

956
00:28:22,934 --> 00:28:24,101
2017, -- THIS IS IN CONNECTION 

957
00:28:24,101 --> 00:28:24,935
WITH THE RUSSIAN MANIPULATION 

958
00:28:24,935 --> 00:28:26,537
OF THE ELECTION AND THE DATA 

959
00:28:26,537 --> 00:28:29,640
THAT CAME FROM FACEBOOK, 

960
00:28:29,640 --> 00:28:31,776
INITIALLY. 

961
00:28:31,776 --> 00:28:34,612
I ASKED FOR FORGIVENESS. 

962
00:28:34,612 --> 00:28:37,248
I WILL WORK TO DO BETTER. 

963
00:28:37,248 --> 00:28:41,319
SO, IT SEEMS TO ME FROM THIS 

964
00:28:41,319 --> 00:28:44,989
HISTORY THAT SELF-REGULATION 

965
00:28:44,989 --> 00:28:46,391
DOES THIS IS PROOF TO ME THAT 

966
00:28:46,391 --> 00:28:47,625
SELF-REGULATION SIMPLY DOES NOT 

967
00:28:47,625 --> 00:28:49,928
WORK. 

968
00:28:49,928 --> 00:28:54,766
I HAVE A BILL, THE SECURE AND 

969
00:28:54,766 --> 00:28:56,234
PROTECT AMERICANS DATA ACT THAT 

970
00:28:56,234 --> 00:29:01,039
I HOPE YOU WILL TAKE A LOOK AT, 

971
00:29:01,039 --> 00:29:02,440
IT IS A VERY SIMPLE BILL ABOUT 

972
00:29:02,440 --> 00:29:03,474
SETTING STANDARDS FOR HOW YOU 

973
00:29:03,474 --> 00:29:04,676
MAKE SURE THAT THE DATA IS 

974
00:29:04,676 --> 00:29:10,782
PROTECTED, DEADLINES ON HOW YOU 

975
00:29:10,782 --> 00:29:11,783
RELEASE THAT INFORMATION TO THE 

976
00:29:11,783 --> 00:29:12,016
PUBLIC. 

977
00:29:12,016 --> 00:29:13,218
CERTAINLY, IT OUGHT TO GO TO 

978
00:29:13,218 --> 00:29:14,085
THE FTC, AS WELL. 

979
00:29:14,085 --> 00:29:15,053
BUT IN RESPONSE TO THE 

980
00:29:15,053 --> 00:29:18,489
QUESTIONS ABOUT THE APPS AND 

981
00:29:18,489 --> 00:29:19,524
THE INVESTIGATION THAT YOU ARE 

982
00:29:19,524 --> 00:29:27,065
GOING TO DO, YOU SAID YOU DON'T 

983
00:29:27,065 --> 00:29:27,866
NECESSARILY KNOW HOW LONG. 

984
00:29:27,866 --> 00:29:29,067
HAVE YOU SENT ANY DEADLINE FOR 

985
00:29:29,067 --> 00:29:29,300
THAT? 

986
00:29:29,300 --> 00:29:30,501
BECAUSE WE KNOW AS MY COLLEAGUE 

987
00:29:30,501 --> 00:29:31,936
SAID THAT THERE ARE TENS OF 

988
00:29:31,936 --> 00:29:32,704
THOUSANDS -- THERE HAVE 

989
00:29:32,704 --> 00:29:34,539
ACTUALLY BEEN 9 MILLION APPS. 

990
00:29:34,539 --> 00:29:40,645
HOW LONG DO WE HAVE TO WAIT FOR 

991
00:29:40,645 --> 00:29:41,513
THAT KIND OF INVESTIGATION? 

992
00:29:41,513 --> 00:29:42,280
>> CONGRESSWOMAN, WE EXPECT IT 

993
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:43,848
TO TAKE ANY MONTHS.   

994
00:29:43,848 --> 00:29:47,752
>>  YEARS?     

995
00:29:47,752 --> 00:29:48,653
>>  I HOPE NOT. 

996
00:29:48,653 --> 00:29:48,987
>> OKAY. 

997
00:29:48,987 --> 00:29:54,459

00:30:10,108 --> 00:30:12,343
CAN WE GET THAT? 

1007
00:30:12,343 --> 00:30:21,152
AND HOW MANY ARE THERE TOTAL?   

1008
00:30:21,152 --> 00:30:22,287
>>  CONGRESSWOMAN, WE CAN 

1009
00:30:22,287 --> 00:30:23,721
FOLLOW UP WITH YOU TO MAKE SURE 

1010
00:30:23,721 --> 00:30:24,756
YOU GET ALL OF THAT 

1011
00:30:24,756 --> 00:30:25,089
INFORMATION. 

1012
00:30:25,089 --> 00:30:25,990
>> YES BUT ORDER OF MAGNITUDE ? 

1013
00:30:25,990 --> 00:30:27,358
>> I DON'T BELIEVE IT WAS A 

1014
00:30:27,358 --> 00:30:28,993
LARGE NUMBER BUT AS WE COMPLETE 

1015
00:30:28,993 --> 00:30:29,693
THE AUDITS, WE WILL KNOW MORE. 

1016
00:30:29,693 --> 00:30:32,930
>> WHAT IS A LARGE NUMBER? 

1017
00:30:32,930 --> 00:30:33,464
>> A HANDFUL. 

1018
00:30:33,464 --> 00:30:34,499
>> HAS FACEBOOK TRIED TO GET 

1019
00:30:34,499 --> 00:30:40,371
THOSE FIRMS TO DELETE FACEBOOK

00:30:40,371 --> 00:30:41,205
DATA AND ITS DERIVATIVES? 

1021
00:30:41,205 --> 00:30:41,739
>> YES, CONGRESSWOMAN. 

1022
00:30:41,739 --> 00:30:42,807
IN 2015 WHEN WE FIRST LEARNED 

1023
00:30:42,807 --> 00:30:51,950
ABOUT IT, WE IMMEDIATELY 

1024
00:30:51,950 --> 00:30:52,984
DEMANDED THAT THE DEVELOPER AND 

1025

REPRESENTED TO US THAT THEY 

1028
00:30:56,721 --> 00:30:56,921
HAD. 

1029
00:30:56,921 --> 00:30:58,056
IT WAS NOT UNTIL ONE MONTH AGO 

1030
00:30:58,056 --> 00:30:59,057
THAT NEW REPORTS SUGGESTED THAT 

1031
00:30:59,057 --> 00:31:00,258
THEY HADN'T WHICH IS WHAT HAS 

1032
00:31:00,258 --> 00:31:01,693
KICKED OFF US NEEDING TO NOW GO

>> DERIVATIVES? 

1038
00:31:09,233 --> 00:31:15,506
>> NEED TO COMPLETE THE AUDIT 

1039
00:31:15,506 --> 00:31:16,541
BEFORE I CAN CONFIRM THAT. 

1040
00:31:16,541 --> 00:31:17,742
WE NEED TO GET INTO THEIR 

1041
00:31:17,742 --> 00:31:19,310
SYSTEMS AND CONFIRM BEFORE I 

1042
00:31:19,310 --> 00:31:21,612

EXACTLY THE PROTECTIONS THAT 

1052
00:31:39,464 --> 00:31:42,166
ARE GUARANTEED -- NOT THE -- 

1053
00:31:42,166 --> 00:31:43,534
WHAT DID YOU SAY? 

1054
00:31:43,534 --> 00:31:49,007
NOT THE -- JUST THE CONTROLS, 

1055
00:31:49,007 --> 00:31:50,241
BUT ALL THE RIGHTS THAT ARE 

1056
00:31:50,241 --> 00:31:51,609
GUARANTEED UNDER THE GENERAL 

1057
00:31:51,609 --> 00:31:56,147
DATA PROJECTION REGULATIONS 

1058
00:31:56,147 --> 00:31:57,148
WILL BE APPLIED TO AMERICANS, 

1059
00:31:57,148 --> 00:31:57,448
AS WELL? 

1060
00:31:57,448 --> 00:31:58,383
>> CONGRESSWOMAN, THE GDPR HAS 

1061
00:31:58,383 --> 00:32:00,618
A BUNCH OF DIFFERENT IMPORTANT 

1062
00:32:00,618 --> 00:32:00,851
PIECES. 

1063
00:32:00,851 --> 00:32:11,362
ONE IS A ROUND OFFERING 

1064
00:32:11,362 --> 00:32:12,229
CONTROLS OVER SPECIFIC, OVER 

1065
00:32:12,229 --> 00:32:12,630
EVERY USE. 

1066
00:32:12,630 --> 00:32:13,431
THAT WE ARE DOING. 

1067
00:32:13,431 --> 00:32:14,432
THE SECOND ONE IS AROUND 

1068
00:32:14,432 --> 00:32:15,266
PUSHING FOR AFFIRMATIVE CONSENT 

1069
00:32:15,266 --> 00:32:22,140
INCLUDING A CONTROL IN FRONT OF 

1070
00:32:22,140 --> 00:32:23,141
PEOPLE THAT WALK PEOPLE THROUGH 

1071
00:32:23,141 --> 00:32:23,541
THEIR CHOICES. 

1072
00:32:23,541 --> 00:32:24,575
WE DO THAT, AS WELL. 

1073
00:32:24,575 --> 00:32:25,576
THE SECOND -- ALTHOUGH, THAT 

1074
00:32:25,576 --> 00:32:26,611
MIGHT BE DIFFERENT DEPENDING ON 

1075
00:32:26,611 --> 00:32:30,782
THE SPECIFIC MALLS AND COUNTRIES

1076
00:32:30,782 --> 00:32:32,283
THAT WE WILL PUT A TOOL THAT 

1077
00:32:32,283 --> 00:32:33,117
WALKS THEM THROUGH THEIR 

1078
00:32:33,117 --> 00:32:33,918
SETTINGS AND HELP THEM 

1079

UNDERSTAND. 

1080
00:32:34,218 --> 00:32:35,353
>> IT SOUNDS LIKE IT WILL NOT 

1081
00:32:35,353 --> 00:32:35,753
BE EXACT. 

1082
00:32:35,753 --> 00:32:36,954
AS WE LOOK AT DISTRIBUTION OF 

1083
00:32:36,954 --> 00:32:37,989
YOUR INFORMATION, WHO IS GOING 

1084
00:32:37,989 --> 00:32:39,190
TO PROTECT US FROM FACEBOOK IS 

1085
00:32:39,190 --> 00:32:39,756
ALSO A QUESTION. 

1086
00:32:39,756 --> 00:32:45,329
>> YOUR TIME HAS EXPIRED. 

1087
00:32:45,329 --> 00:32:46,130

TODAY IS CLEARLY TIMELY AND 

1094
00:32:59,510 --> 00:33:00,545
THERE'S A NUMBER OF EXTREMELY 

1095
00:33:00,545 --> 00:33:01,012
IMPORTANT QUESTIONS. 

1096
00:33:01,012 --> 00:33:01,746
AMERICANS HAVE ABOUT FACEBOOK 

1097
00:33:01,746 --> 00:33:02,580
INCLUDING SECURITY OF THEIR 

1098
00:33:02,580 --> 00:33:07,919

1099
00:33:07,919 --> 00:33:09,253
THEIR DATA IS MADE AVAILABLE TO 

1100
00:33:09,253 --> 00:33:10,054
THIRD PARTIES, ABOUT WHAT 

1101
00:33:10,054 --> 00:33:11,089
FACEBOOK IS DOING TO PROTECT 

1102
00:33:11,089 --> 00:33:12,090
CONSUMER PRIVACY AS WE MOVE 

1103
00:33:12,090 --> 00:33:13,324
FORWARD BUT ONE OF THE ISSUES 

1104
00:33:13,324 --> 00:33:14,525
THAT IS CONCERNING ME AND I 

1105
00:33:14,525 --> 00:33:16,994
WOULD LIKE TO DIG INTO IS HOW 

1106
00:33:16,994 --> 00:33:17,995
FACEBOOK TREATS CONTENT ON ITS 

1107
00:33:17,995 --> 00:33:18,262

1108
00:33:18,262 --> 00:33:19,597
MR. ZUCKERBERG, GIVEN THE 

1109
00:33:19,597 --> 00:33:29,173
EXTENSIVE REACH THOSE BREACH OF 

1110
00:33:29,173 --> 00:33:30,174
FACEBOOK AND ITS WIDESPREAD USE 

1111
00:33:30,174 --> 00:33:31,609
AS A TOOL OF EXPRESSION, DO YOU 

1112
00:33:31,609 --> 00:33:32,610
THINK FACEBOOK HAS THE UNIQUE 

1113
00:33:32,610 --> 00:33:33,444
RESPONSIBILITY TO ASSURE THAT 

1114
00:33:33,444 --> 00:33:34,878
IT HAS CLEAR STANDARDS IN 

1115
00:33:34,878 --> 00:33:49,060
REGARDING CLEAR CENSORSHIP ON 

1116
00:33:49,060 --> 00:33:50,294
ITS PLATFORM AND DO YOU THINK 

1117
00:33:50,294 --> 00:33:51,129
FACEBOOK ADEQUATELY AND CLEARLY 

1118
00:33:51,129 --> 00:33:52,163
DEFINES WHAT THE STANDARDS ARE 

1119
00:33:52,163 --> 00:33:52,696
FOR ITS USERS? 

1120
00:33:52,696 --> 00:33:54,198
>> YES, I FEEL LIKE WE HAVE A 

1121
00:33:54,198 --> 00:33:54,865
VERY IMPORTANT RESPONSIBILITY 

1122
00:33:54,865 --> 00:33:55,800
TO OUTLINE WHAT THE CONTENT 

1123
00:33:55,800 --> 00:33:56,834
POLICIES ARE AND WHAT THE 

1124
00:33:56,834 --> 00:33:57,435
COMMUNITY STANDARDS ARE. 

1125
00:33:57,435 --> 00:33:58,870
THIS IS ONE OF THE AREAS THAT, 

1126
00:33:58,870 --> 00:34:00,037
FRANKLY, I AM WORRIED THAT WE 

1127
00:34:00,037 --> 00:34:01,472
ARE NOT DOING A GOOD ENOUGH JOB 

1128
00:34:01,472 --> 00:34:02,073
AT RIGHT NOW. 

1129
00:34:02,073 --> 00:34:03,707
ESPECIALLY, BECAUSE AT -- AS AN 

1130
00:34:03,707 --> 00:34:06,144
AMERICAN BASED COMPANY WHERE 

1131
00:34:06,144 --> 00:34:07,778
NOT A % OR OUTSIDE OF THE U.S. 

1132
00:34:07,778 --> 00:34:08,779
AND THERE ARE DIFFERENT SOCIAL 

1133
00:34:08,779 --> 00:34:09,780
NORMS IN DIFFERENT CULTURES, IT 

1134
00:34:09,780 --> 00:34:11,215
IS NOT CLEAR TO ME THAT OUR 

1135
00:34:11,215 --> 00:34:12,216
CURRENT SITUATION OF HOW WE 

1136
00:34:12,216 --> 00:34:13,050
DEFINE COMMUNITY STANDARDS IS 

1137
00:34:13,050 --> 00:34:24,594
GOING TO BE EFFECTIVE AND 

1138
00:34:24,594 --> 00:34:25,663
ARTICULATE AROUND THE WORLD SO 

1139
00:34:25,663 --> 00:34:26,664
WE ARE LOOKING AT DIFFERENT 

1140
00:34:26,664 --> 00:34:28,099
WAYS TO EVOLVE THAT AND I THINK 

1141
00:34:28,099 --> 00:34:29,333
THIS IS ONE OF THE IMPORTANT 

1142
00:34:29,333 --> 00:34:30,234
THINGS THAT WE WILL DO. 

1143
00:34:30,234 --> 00:34:31,335
>> OKAY AND EVEN FOCUSING ON 

1144
00:34:31,335 --> 00:34:32,437
CONTENT HERE IN AMERICA, I 

1145
00:34:32,437 --> 00:34:33,571
WOULD LIKE TO SHIFT GEARS JUST 

1146
00:34:33,571 --> 00:34:34,772
A LITTLE BIT AND TALK ABOUT 

1147
00:34:34,772 --> 00:34:36,139
FACEBOOK'S RECENT CHANGES TO 

1148
00:34:36,139 --> 00:34:37,007
ITS NEW FEED ALGORITHM. 

1149
00:34:37,007 --> 00:34:38,041
YOUR HEAD UP NEWS PARTNERSHIPS 

1150
00:34:38,041 --> 00:34:39,043
RECENTLY SAID THAT FACEBOOK IS 

1151
00:34:39,043 --> 00:34:40,277
"TAKING A STEP TO DEFINE WHAT 

1152
00:34:40,277 --> 00:34:41,279
QUALITY NEWS LOOKS LIKE AND 

1153
00:34:41,279 --> 00:34:42,480
GIVE THAT A BOOST SO THAT 

1154
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:43,313
OVERALL, THERE IS LESS 

1155
00:34:43,313 --> 00:34:43,915

1156
00:34:43,915 --> 00:34:45,349
CAN YOU TELL ME WHAT SHE MEANS 

1157
00:34:45,349 --> 00:34:48,186
BY "LESS COMPETITION FROM NEWS

1158
00:34:48,186 --> 00:34:49,186
?" AND HOW DOES FACEBOOK 

1159
00:34:49,186 --> 00:34:50,021
OBJECTIVELY DETERMINE WHAT IS 

1160
00:34:50,021 --> 00:34:51,021
SAFE NEWS AND WHAT SAFEGUARDS 

1161
00:34:51,021 --> 00:35:01,432
EXIST TO DETERMINE THAT 

1162
00:35:01,432 --> 00:35:02,233
CONSERVATIVE CONTENT IS TREATED 

1163
00:35:02,233 --> 00:35:02,466
FAIRLY? 

1164
00:35:02,466 --> 00:35:03,467
>> I AM NOT SURE SPECIFICALLY 

1165
00:35:03,467 --> 00:35:04,468
WHAT THAT PERSON WAS REFERRING 

1166
00:35:04,468 --> 00:35:05,870
TO BUT I CAN WALK YOU THROUGH 

1167
00:35:05,870 --> 00:35:06,871
WHAT THE ALGORITHM CHANGE WAS 

1168
00:35:06,871 --> 00:35:09,139
IF THAT IS USEFUL. 

1169
00:35:09,139 --> 00:35:10,741
>> MAYBE I WILL GO ON TO MAIL 

1170
00:35:10,741 --> 00:35:11,141
THE QUESTIONS. 

1171
00:35:11,141 --> 00:35:12,343
THERE IS AN ISSUE OF CONTENT 

1172
00:35:12,343 --> 00:35:12,710
DISCRIMINATION. 

1173
00:35:12,710 --> 00:35:13,978
IT IS NOT A PROBLEM UNIQUE TO 

1174
00:35:13,978 --> 00:35:15,646
FACEBOOK BUT A NUMBER OF HIGH 

1175
00:35:15,646 --> 00:35:20,484
PROFILE PROFILERS ENGAGED IN 

1176
00:35:20,484 --> 00:35:21,085
BLOCKING AND CENSORING 

1177
00:35:21,085 --> 00:35:21,752
RELIGIOUS CONSERVATIVE CONTENT. 

1178
00:35:21,752 --> 00:35:23,020
FCC CHAIRMAN PYE EVEN SAID THAT 

1179
00:35:23,020 --> 00:35:25,756
THEY ARE ROUTINELY BLOCKED OR 

1180
00:35:25,756 --> 00:35:32,697
DISCRIMINATED AGAINST CONTENT 

1181

THEY DON'T LIKE. 

1182
00:35:33,297 --> 00:35:34,532
HOW WOULD YOU RESPOND TO SUCH 

1183
00:35:34,532 --> 00:35:35,533
AN ALLEGATION AND WHAT IS 

1184
00:35:35,533 --> 00:35:36,567
FACEBOOK DOING TO ASSURE THAT 

1185
00:35:36,567 --> 00:35:37,568
ITS USERS ARE BEING TREATED 

1186
00:35:37,568 --> 00:35:38,936

PLATFORM FOR ALL IDEAS IS 

1190
00:35:46,277 --> 00:35:47,311
SOMETHING I CARE VERY DEEPLY 

1191
00:35:47,311 --> 00:35:47,544
ABOUT. 

1192
00:35:47,544 --> 00:35:51,349
I AM WORRIED ABOUT BIAS. AND WE 

1193
00:35:51,349 --> 00:35:52,783
TAKE A NUMBER OF STEPS TO MAKE 

1194
00:35:52,783 --> 00:35:53,985
SURE THAT NONE OF THE CHANGES 

1195
00:35:53,985 --> 00:36:07,031
WE MAKE ARE TARGETED IN ANY 

1196
00:36:07,031 --> 00:36:07,832
KIND OF BIASED WAY. 

1197
00:36:07,832 --> 00:36:09,267
AND I WOULD BE HAPPY TO FOLLOW 

1198
00:36:09,267 --> 00:36:10,668
UP WITH YOU AND GO INTO MORE 

1199
00:36:10,668 --> 00:36:11,902
DETAIL ON THAT BECAUSE I AGREE 

1200
00:36:11,902 --> 00:36:13,003
THAT THIS IS A SERIOUS ISSUE. 

1201
00:36:13,003 --> 00:36:13,904
>> OVER EASTER, THE CATHOLIC 

1202

UNIVERSITY'S AD WITH A PICTURE 

1203
00:36:14,905 --> 00:36:15,940
OF THE HISTORIC CROSS REJECTED 

1204
00:36:15,940 --> 00:36:16,340
BY FACEBOOK. 

1205
00:36:16,340 --> 00:36:17,675
FACEBOOK ADDRESSED THE AIR 

1206
00:36:17,675 --> 00:36:23,047
WITHIN DAYS BUT THAT IT 

1207
00:36:23,047 --> 00:36:24,048
HAPPENED AT ALL IS DEEPLY 

1208
00:36:24,048 --> 00:36:24,348
DISTURBING. 

1209
00:36:24,348 --> 00:36:25,483
CAN YOU TELL ME WHAT WAS 

1210
00:36:25,483 --> 00:36:26,083
SHOCKING, SENSATIONAL OR 

1211
00:36:26,083 --> 00:36:26,884
EXCESSIVELY VIOLENT ABOUT THE 

1212
00:36:26,884 --> 00:36:28,119
AD THAT CAUSED IT TO BE 

1213
00:36:28,119 --> 00:36:28,919
INITIALLY CENSORED GIVEN THAT 

1214
00:36:28,919 --> 00:36:30,154
YOUR COMPANY DID NOT SAY THAT 

1215
00:36:30,154 --> 00:36:36,460
IT VIOLATED TERMS OF SERVICE. 

1216
00:36:36,460 --> 00:36:37,461
HOW CAN VIEWERS KNOW THEIR 

1217
00:36:37,461 --> 00:36:38,496
CONTENT IS BEING VIEWED AND 

1218
00:36:38,496 --> 00:36:39,130
JUDGED ACCORDINGLY TO 

1219
00:36:39,130 --> 00:36:39,430
STANDARDS? 

1220
00:36:39,430 --> 00:36:40,031
>> CONGRESSWOMAN, IT SOUNDS 

1221
00:36:40,031 --> 00:36:44,802
LIKE WE MADE A MISTAKE, THERE. 

1222
00:36:44,802 --> 00:36:45,636
I APOLOGIZE FOR THAT. 

1223
00:36:45,636 --> 00:36:46,604
WITH THE CURRENT SYSTEMS WE 

1224
00:36:46,604 --> 00:36:47,805
HAVE IN PLACE TO REVIEW, WE 

1225
00:36:47,805 --> 00:36:52,910
MAKE A RELATIVELY SMALL % OF 

1226
00:36:52,910 --> 00:36:53,911
THE STAKES IN CONTENT REVIEW 

1227
00:36:53,911 --> 00:36:55,146
BUT THAT CAN BE TOO MANY. 

1228
00:36:55,146 --> 00:36:56,547
AND THIS IS AN AREA WHERE WE 

1229
00:36:56,547 --> 00:36:57,147
NEED TO IMPROVE. 

1230
00:36:57,147 --> 00:36:58,582
WHAT I WILL SAY IS THAT I 

1231
00:36:58,582 --> 00:36:59,617
WOULDN'T EXTRAPOLATE FROM A FEW 

1232
00:36:59,617 --> 00:37:02,653
EXAMPLES TO ASSUMING THAT THE 

1233
00:37:02,653 --> 00:37:03,654
OVERALL SYSTEM IS BIASED. 

1234
00:37:03,654 --> 00:37:04,889
I GET HOW PEOPLE CAN LOOK AT 

1235
00:37:04,889 --> 00:37:06,090
AND DRAW THAT CONCLUSION THAT I 

1236
00:37:06,090 --> 00:37:07,325
DON'T THINK THAT REFLECTS THE 

1237
00:37:07,325 --> 00:37:19,303
WAY THAT WE WERE TRYING TO 

1238
00:37:19,303 --> 00:37:20,504
BUILD THE SYSTEM OR WHAT WE 

1239
00:37:20,504 --> 00:37:20,837
HAVE SEEN. 

1240
00:37:20,837 --> 00:37:21,339
>> THANK YOU. 

1241
00:37:21,339 --> 00:37:22,540
THIS IS AN IMPORTANT ISSUE ON 

1242
00:37:22,540 --> 00:37:22,973
BUILDING TRUST. 

1243
00:37:22,973 --> 00:37:24,174
THAT IS GOING TO BE IMPORTANT 

1244
00:37:24,174 --> 00:37:24,941
AS WE MOVE FORWARD.

YOUR TESTIMONY HERE TODAY. 

1251
00:37:39,223 --> 00:37:40,424
YOU HAVE STATED THAT YOUR GOAL 

1252
00:37:40,424 --> 00:37:41,459
WITH FACEBOOK IS TO BUILD 

1253
00:37:41,459 --> 00:37:42,059
STRONG COMMUNITIES AND 

1254
00:37:42,059 --> 00:37:42,860
CERTAINLY, THAT SOUNDS GOOD. 

1255
00:37:42,860 --> 00:37:44,095
YOU HAVE STATED HERE TODAY ON 

1256
00:37:44,095 --> 00:37:45,296
THE RECORD THAT YOU DID NOT 

1257
00:37:45,296 --> 00:37:46,364
LIVE UP TO THE PRIVACY 

1258
00:37:46,364 --> 00:37:47,164
EXPECTATIONS AND I APPRECIATE 

1259
00:37:47,164 --> 00:37:47,364
THAT. 

1260
00:37:47,364 --> 00:37:54,638
BUT THIS COMMITTEE -- AND YOU 

1261
00:37:54,638 --> 00:37:55,673
MUST KNOW THIS -- THIS 

1262
00:37:55,673 --> 00:37:56,974
COMMITTEE IS COUNTING ON YOU TO 

1263
00:37:56,974 --> 00:37:58,309
RIGHT A WRONG AND I HOPE YOU 

1264
00:37:58,309 --> 00:37:58,709
GET IT. 

1265
00:37:58,709 --> 00:37:59,944
IN MY OPINION, FACEBOOK IS HERE 

1266
00:37:59,944 --> 00:38:00,344
TO STAY. 

1267
00:38:00,344 --> 00:38:01,578
AND SO YOU HAVE AN OBLIGATION 

1268
00:38:01,578 --> 00:38:04,181
TO PROTECT THE DATA THAT YOU 

1269
00:38:04,181 --> 00:38:05,416
COLLECT AND THE DATA THAT YOU 

1270
00:38:05,416 --> 00:38:06,650
USE AND CONGRESS HAS THE POWER 

1271
00:38:06,650 --> 00:38:07,651
TO REGULATE YOUR INDUSTRY AND 

1272
00:38:07,651 --> 00:38:11,722
WE HAVE THE POWER TO PENALIZE 

1273
00:38:11,722 --> 00:38:12,022
MISCONDUCT. 

1274
00:38:12,022 --> 00:38:13,524
BUT I WANT TO GO IN A DIFFERENT 

1275
00:38:13,524 --> 00:38:14,158
DIRECTION TODAY, SIR. 

1276
00:38:14,158 --> 00:38:15,159
YOU AND YOUR TEAM CERTAINLY 

1277
00:38:15,159 --> 00:38:16,394

1279
00:38:17,694 --> 00:38:22,099

1280
00:38:22,099 --> 00:38:22,900
THAT ALL THE TIME. 

1281
00:38:22,900 --> 00:38:24,335
LET ME ASK YOU THIS AND THE 

1282
00:38:24,335 --> 00:38:25,169
CONGRESSIONAL BLACK CAUCUS HAS 

1283
00:38:25,169 --> 00:38:26,136
BEEN VERY FOCUSED ON HOLDING 

1284
00:38:26,136 --> 00:38:33,444
YOUR INDUSTRY ACCOUNTABLE, NOT 

1285
00:38:33,444 --> 00:38:34,445

ALL LEVELS OF THE INDUSTRY. 

1289
00:38:36,714 --> 00:38:38,115
AND I KNOW THAT YOU HAVE A 

1290
00:38:38,115 --> 00:38:39,116
NUMBER OF DIVERSITY ISSUES. 

1291
00:38:39,116 --> 00:38:39,950
IN 2017, YOU INCREASED YOUR 

1292
00:38:39,950 --> 00:38:40,951
BLACK REPRESENTATION FROM 2% TO 

1293
00:38:40,951 --> 00:38:42,085
THREE TO PRESENT. 

1294
00:38:42,085 --> 00:38:51,729
-- TO 3%. 

1295
00:38:51,729 --> 00:38:52,797
THAT IS BETTER THAN NONE. 

1296
00:38:52,797 --> 00:38:53,798
THIS DOES NOT MEET THE 

1297
00:38:53,798 --> 00:38:54,598
DEFINITION OF BUILDING A 

1298
00:38:54,598 --> 00:38:55,198
RACIALLY DIVERSE COMMUNITY. 

1299
00:38:55,198 --> 00:38:56,434
CEO LEADERSHIP AND I FOUND THIS 

1300
00:38:56,434 --> 00:38:57,435
TO BE ABSOLUTELY TRUE, CEO 

1301
00:38:57,435 --> 00:38:59,036
LEADERSHIP ON DIVERSITY IS THE 

1302
00:38:59,036 --> 00:39:03,307
ONLY WAY THAT THE TECHNOLOGY 

1303
00:39:03,307 --> 00:39:03,908
INDUSTRY WILL CHANGE. 

1304
00:39:03,908 --> 00:39:05,142
SO, WILL YOU COMMIT, SERVE TO 

1305
00:39:05,142 --> 00:39:05,943
CONVENE, PERSONALLY CONVENE A 

1306
00:39:05,943 --> 00:39:07,611
MEETING OF THE CEOS IN YOUR 

1307
00:39:07,611 --> 00:39:13,451
SECTORS? MANY OF THEM ARE ALL 

1308
00:39:13,451 --> 00:39:14,485
OF THEM, PERHAPS, ARE YOUR 

1309
00:39:14,485 --> 00:39:15,686
FRIENDS, AND TO DO THIS VERY 

1310
00:39:15,686 --> 00:39:16,720
QUICKLY TO DEVELOP A STRATEGY 

1311
00:39:16,720 --> 00:39:28,532
TO INCREASE RACIAL DIVERSITY IN 

1312
00:39:28,532 --> 00:39:29,099
THE TECHNOLOGY INDUSTRY? 

1313
00:39:29,099 --> 00:39:30,568
>> I THINK THAT IS A GOOD IDEA 

1314
00:39:30,568 --> 00:39:31,969
AND WE SHOULD FOLLOW UP ON IT. 

1315
00:39:31,969 --> 00:39:32,970
FROM THE CONVERSATIONS I HAVE 

1316
00:39:32,970 --> 00:39:34,171
HAD FOR MY FELLOW LEADERS IN 

1317
00:39:34,171 --> 00:39:35,406
THE TECH INDUSTRY, I KNOW THIS 

1318
00:39:35,406 --> 00:39:36,407
IS SOMETHING THAT WE ALL 

1319
00:39:36,407 --> 00:39:37,241
UNDERSTAND THE WHOLE INDUSTRY 

1320
00:39:37,241 --> 00:39:38,642
IS BEHIND AND FACE BOOK -- AND 

1321
00:39:38,642 --> 00:39:41,879
FACEBOOK IS CERTAINLY A PART OF 

1322
00:39:41,879 --> 00:39:42,079
IT. 

1323
00:39:42,079 --> 00:39:43,113
WE KNOW THAT HAVING DIFFERENT 

1324
00:39:43,113 --> 00:39:43,914
VIEWPOINTS IS SOMETHING THAT 

1325
00:39:43,914 --> 00:39:44,949
WILL HELP US SERVE OUR 

1326
00:39:44,949 --> 00:39:45,349
COMMUNITY BETTER. 

1327
00:39:45,349 --> 00:39:46,584
THIS IS SOMETHING WE ARE HERE 

1328
00:39:46,584 --> 00:39:46,984
TO DO. 

1329
00:39:46,984 --> 00:39:48,185
I THINK THE WHOLE INDUSTRY IS 

1330
00:39:48,185 --> 00:39:48,886
BEHIND US ON THIS. 

1331
00:39:48,886 --> 00:39:51,455
>> THERE HAS BEEN MARGINAL 

1332
00:39:51,455 --> 00:39:52,456
IMPROVEMENT BUT WE MUST DO 

1333
00:39:52,456 --> 00:39:53,924
BETTER THAN WE HAVE DONE 

1334
00:39:53,924 --> 00:39:54,692
RECENTLY. 

1335
00:39:54,692 --> 00:39:55,459
YOU APPOINTED AN AFRICAN-

1336
00:39:55,459 --> 00:39:57,094
AMERICAN TO YOUR BOARD. 

1337
00:39:57,094 --> 00:40:05,703
AND ALSO A FRIEND. 

1338
00:40:05,703 --> 00:40:06,871
BUT WE HAVE TO CONCENTRATE MORE 

1339
00:40:06,871 --> 00:40:07,838
ON BOARD MEMBERSHIP FOR AFRICAN-

1340
00:40:07,838 --> 00:40:08,505
AMERICANS AND ALSO MINORITIES 

1341
00:40:08,505 --> 00:40:09,974
AT THE ENTRY-LEVEL WITHIN YOUR 

1342
00:40:09,974 --> 00:40:16,613
COUNTRY -- WITHIN YOUR COMPANY. 

1343
00:40:16,613 --> 00:40:18,048
I WAS LOOKING AT YOUR WEBSITE A 

1344
00:40:18,048 --> 00:40:19,283
FEW MINUTES AGO AND IT LOOKS 

1345
00:40:19,283 --> 00:40:20,284
LIKE YOU LIST FIVE INDIVIDUALS 

1346
00:40:20,284 --> 00:40:21,318
AS LEADERSHIP IN YOUR COMPANY 

1347
00:40:21,318 --> 00:40:22,653
BUT NONE OF THEM ARE AFRICAN-

1348
00:40:22,653 --> 00:40:22,920
AMERICAN. 

1349
00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:23,954
NOT ONLY YOU AND CHERYL BUT 

1350
00:40:23,954 --> 00:40:24,755
DAVID, MIKE AND CHRIS. 

1351
00:40:24,755 --> 00:40:30,060
THAT IS YOUR LEADERSHIP TEAM 

1352
00:40:30,060 --> 00:40:31,061
AND THIS DOES NOT REFLECT 

1353
00:40:31,061 --> 00:40:31,328
AMERICA. 

1354
00:40:31,328 --> 00:40:32,529
CAN YOU IMPROVE THE NUMBERS ON 

1355
00:40:32,529 --> 00:40:34,231
YOUR LEADERSHIP TEAM TO BE MORE 

1356
00:40:34,231 --> 00:40:35,132
DIVERSE?    

1357
00:40:35,132 --> 00:40:36,367
>>  CONGRESSMAN, THIS IS AN 

1358
00:40:36,367 --> 00:40:40,204
ISSUE THAT WE ARE FOCUSED ON.  

1359
00:40:40,204 --> 00:40:41,205
WE HAVE A BROADER LEADERSHIP 

1360
00:40:41,205 --> 00:40:41,938
THAN JUST FIVE PEOPLE. 

1361
00:40:41,938 --> 00:40:56,353
>> IT IS NOT ON YOUR WEBSITE.   

1362
00:40:56,353 --> 00:40:57,354
>>  I UNDERSTAND THAT. 

1363
00:40:57,354 --> 00:40:58,689
>> WE CAN DO BETTER THAN THAT, 

1364
00:40:58,689 --> 00:40:59,089
MR. ZUCKERBERG. 

1365
00:40:59,089 --> 00:41:00,424
DO YOU PLAN TO ADD AN AFRICAN-

1366
00:41:00,424 --> 00:41:01,125
AMERICAN TO YOUR LEADERSHIP 

1367
00:41:01,125 --> 00:41:02,126
TEAM IN THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE 

1368
00:41:02,126 --> 00:41:03,360
AND WILL YOU COMMIT TO CONTINUE 

1369
00:41:03,360 --> 00:41:04,394
TO WORK WITH THE CONGRESSIONAL 

1370
00:41:04,394 --> 00:41:05,195
BLACK CAUCUS TO INCREASE 

1371
00:41:05,195 --> 00:41:06,229
DIVERSITY WITHIN YOUR COMPANY  

1372
00:41:06,229 --> 00:41:07,297
THAT YOU ARE SO PROUD OF? 

1373
00:41:07,297 --> 00:41:08,065
>> CONGRESSMAN, WE WILL 

1374
00:41:08,065 --> 00:41:08,866
CERTAINLY WORK WITH YOU. 

1375
00:41:08,866 --> 00:41:09,799
THIS IS AN IMPORTANT ISSUE. 

1376
00:41:09,799 --> 00:41:10,901
>> WE ALSO FIND THAT COMPANIES 

1377
00:41:10,901 --> 00:41:16,974
FAIL TO RETAIN BLACK EMPLOYEES 

1378
00:41:16,974 --> 00:41:17,775
CONTRIBUTING TO THEIR LOW 

1379
00:41:17,775 --> 00:41:18,375
PRESENCE IN TECHNOLOGY 

1380
00:41:18,375 --> 00:41:19,376
COMPANIES AND THERE IS LITTLE 

1381
00:41:19,376 --> 00:41:20,010
ú 

1382
00:41:20,010 --> 00:41:21,211
NUMBERS SO WILL YOU COMMIT TO 

1383
00:41:21,211 --> 00:41:22,046
PROVIDING NUMBERS ON YOUR 

1384
00:41:22,046 --> 00:41:23,247
RETENTION -- THAT IS THE BIG 

1385
00:41:23,247 --> 00:41:24,515
WORD, RETENTION OF YOUR 

1386
00:41:24,515 --> 00:41:26,317
EMPLOYEES DISAGGREGATED BY RACE 

1387
00:41:26,317 --> 00:41:27,117
AND YOUR DIVERSITY UPDATE 

1388
00:41:27,117 --> 00:41:27,718
STARTING THIS YEAR? 

1389
00:41:27,718 --> 00:41:28,752
CAN WE GET THAT DATA? 

1390
00:41:28,752 --> 00:41:38,528
THAT IS THE STARTING POINT. 

1391
00:41:38,528 --> 00:41:39,530
>> CONGRESSMAN, WE TRY TO 

1392
00:41:39,530 --> 00:41:40,564
INCLUDE A LOT OF IMPORTANT 

1393
00:41:40,564 --> 00:41:41,365
INFORMATION IN THE DIVERSITY 

1394
00:41:41,365 --> 00:41:41,598
UPDATE. 

1395
00:41:41,598 --> 00:41:43,000
I WILL GO AND DISCUSS THAT WITH 

1396
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:44,501
MY TEAM AFTER I GET BACK. 

1397
00:41:44,501 --> 00:41:45,836
>> I AM OUT OF TIME, SIR. 

1398
00:41:45,836 --> 00:41:47,237
I WILL TAKE THIS UP WITH YOUR 

1399
00:41:47,237 --> 00:41:48,038
TEAM IN ANOTHER SETTING. 

1400
00:41:48,038 --> 00:41:49,673
WE WILL BE OUT THERE IN A FEW 

1401
00:41:49,673 --> 00:41:49,940
MINUTES. 

1402
00:41:49,940 --> 00:41:50,240
THANK YOU. 

1403
00:41:50,240 --> 00:41:51,909
>> YOUR TIME IS EXPIRED. 

1404
00:41:51,909 --> 00:41:53,277
THE GENTLEMAN FROM MISSISSIPPI, 

1405
00:41:53,277 --> 00:41:53,744
MR. HARPER. 

1406
00:41:53,744 --> 00:42:01,452
>> THANK YOU, MR. CHAIRMAN. 

1407
00:42:01,452 --> 00:42:02,453
THANK YOU MR. ZUCKERBERG FOR 

1408
00:42:02,453 --> 00:42:03,687
BEING HERE AND WE DON'T LOSE 

1409
00:42:03,687 --> 00:42:05,089
SIGHT OF THE FACT THAT YOU ARE 

1410
00:42:05,089 --> 00:42:06,123
A GREAT AMERICAN SUCCESS STORY. 

1411
00:42:06,123 --> 00:42:07,725
IT IS A PART OF EVERYONE'S LIFE 

1412
00:42:07,725 --> 00:42:08,158
AND BUSINESS. 

1413
00:42:08,158 --> 00:42:13,464
SOMETIMES, MAYBE TOO OFTEN. 

1414
00:42:13,464 --> 00:42:14,865
BUT I THANK YOU FOR TAKING THE 

1415
00:42:14,865 --> 00:42:15,699
TIME TO BE HERE. 

1416
00:42:15,699 --> 00:42:17,134
AND OUR CONCERN IS TO MAKE SURE 

1417
00:42:17,134 --> 00:42:17,935
THAT IT IS FAIR. 

1418
00:42:17,935 --> 00:42:19,636
WE WORRY BECAUSE WE ARE LOOKING 

1419
00:42:19,636 --> 00:42:24,808
AT POSSIBLE GOVERNMENT 

1420
00:42:24,808 --> 00:42:25,208
REGULATION, HERE. 

1421
00:42:25,208 --> 00:42:25,876
CERTAINLY, THE SELF-GOVERNING 

1422
00:42:25,876 --> 00:42:27,244
WHICH HAS HAD A LOT OF ISSUES 

1423
00:42:27,244 --> 00:42:29,880
AND HOW YOU FACTOR THAT AND WE 

1424
00:42:29,880 --> 00:42:31,882
ARE TRYING TO KEEP UP WITH THE 

1425
00:42:31,882 --> 00:42:33,751
ALGORITHM CHANGES ON HOW YOU 

1426
00:42:33,751 --> 00:42:34,551
DETERMINE THE PRIORITIZATION OF 

1427
00:42:34,551 --> 00:42:42,259
THE NEWSFEEDS AND YOU LOOK AT, 

1428
00:42:42,259 --> 00:42:43,494
IT NEEDS TO BE TRUSTWORTHY AND 

1429
00:42:43,494 --> 00:42:44,094
RELIABLE AND RELEVANT. 

1430
00:42:44,094 --> 00:42:45,863
WELL, WHO IS GOING TO DETERMINE 

1431
00:42:45,863 --> 00:42:47,998
THAT? 

1432
00:42:47,998 --> 00:42:48,999
IT ALSO HAS AN IMPACT. 

1433
00:42:48,999 --> 00:42:50,234
AND EVEN THOUGH YOU SAY YOU 

1434
00:42:50,234 --> 00:42:52,002
DON'T WANT THE BIAS, IT IS 

1435
00:42:52,002 --> 00:42:57,307
DEPENDENT UPON SOMEONE SETTING 

1436
00:42:57,307 --> 00:42:58,308
WHAT THOSE STANDARDS ARE IN 

1437
00:42:58,308 --> 00:42:58,575
THAT. 

1438
00:42:58,575 --> 00:43:00,144
AND I WANT TO ASK YOU A COUPLE 

1439
00:43:00,144 --> 00:43:01,178

CORRECT. 

1456

00:43:54,831 --> 00:43:56,400
ANALYTICA REQUIRED WAS USED TO 

1470
00:43:56,400 --> 00:44:02,806
TARGET VOTERS WITH POLITICAL ADS

1471
00:44:02,806 --> 00:44:10,013
MUCH USED BY THE OBAMA CAMPAIGN 

1472
00:44:10,013 --> 00:44:11,214
IN 2012, WOULD THAT BE CORRECT? 

1473
00:44:11,214 --> 00:44:11,849
>> CONGRESSMAN, THE BIG 

1474
00:44:11,849 --> 00:44:12,683
DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THESE TWO 

1475
00:44:12,683 --> 00:44:17,121
CASES IS THAT THE COGAN CASE, 

1476
00:44:17,121 --> 00:44:18,155
PEOPLE SIGNED INTO THAT APP, 

1477
00:44:18,155 --> 00:44:19,690
EXPECTING TO SHARE THE DATA 

1478
00:44:19,690 --> 00:44:30,367
WITH COGAN AND HE TURNED AROUND 

1479
00:44:30,367 --> 00:44:31,401
IN VIOLATION OF OUR POLICIES 

1480
00:44:31,401 --> 00:44:32,402
AND AND VIOLATIONS OF PEOPLE'S 

1481
00:44:32,402 --> 00:44:33,370
EXPECTATIONS AND FOLDED TO A 

1482
00:44:33,370 --> 00:44:33,970
THIRD-PARTY FIRM, CAMBRIDGE 

1483
00:44:33,970 --> 00:44:34,805
ANALYTICA, IN THIS CASE. 

1484
00:44:34,805 --> 00:44:36,039
I THINK WE WERE VERY CLEAR 

1485
00:44:36,039 --> 00:44:37,241
ABOUT HOW THE FORM WORKED AT 

1486
00:44:37,241 --> 00:44:38,475
THE TIME AND THAT ANYONE COULD 

1487
00:44:38,475 --> 00:44:46,583
SIGN INTO THE APP. 

1488
00:44:46,583 --> 00:44:47,818
AND THEY COULD BRING IN THEIR 

1489
00:44:47,818 --> 00:44:48,819
INFORMATION, IF THEY WANTED AND 

1490
00:44:48,819 --> 00:44:49,653
SOME INFORMATION FROM THEIR 

1491
00:44:49,653 --> 00:44:49,920
FRIENDS. 

1492
00:44:49,920 --> 00:44:50,854
PEOPLE HAD CONTROL OVER THAT 

1493
00:44:50,854 --> 00:44:52,055
AND IF YOU WANTED, YOU COULD 

1494
00:44:52,055 --> 00:44:53,290
TURN OFF THE ABILITY TO SIGN 

1495
00:44:53,290 --> 00:44:54,725
INTO IT OR TURN OFF THE ABILITY 

1496
00:44:54,725 --> 00:44:55,926
FOR YOUR FRIENDS TO BRING IN 

1497
00:44:55,926 --> 00:44:56,259
INFORMATION. 

1498
00:44:56,259 --> 00:44:57,361
THE PLATFORM WORKED THE WAY WE 

1499
00:44:57,361 --> 00:44:58,162
DECIDED AT THE TIME. 

1500
00:44:58,162 --> 00:44:59,630
WE NOW KNOW THAT WE SHOULD HAVE 

1501
00:44:59,630 --> 00:45:10,541
A MORE RESTRICTIVE FORM WHERE 

1502
00:45:10,541 --> 00:45:11,775
PEOPLE CAN NOT ONLY BRING IN 

1503
00:45:11,775 --> 00:45:12,576
INFORMATION FROM THEIR FRIENDS 

1504
00:45:12,576 --> 00:45:13,610
BUT THEIR OWN INFORMATION BUT 

1505
00:45:13,610 --> 00:45:14,812
THAT IS THE WAY THE SYSTEM 

1506
00:45:14,812 --> 00:45:15,045
WORKED. 

1507
00:45:15,045 --> 00:45:16,046
>> WEATHER IN VIOLATION OF THE 

1508
00:45:16,046 --> 00:45:17,047
AGREEMENT OR NOT, YOU AGREE 

1509
00:45:17,047 --> 00:45:18,081
THAT THE USER HAS AN 

1510
00:45:18,081 --> 00:45:18,682
EXPECTATION THAT THEIR 

1511
00:45:18,682 --> 00:45:19,483
INFORMATION WOULD BE PROTECTED 

1512
00:45:19,483 --> 00:45:20,717
AND REMAIN PRIVATE AND NOT BE 

1513
00:45:20,717 --> 00:45:21,919
SOLD SO THAT IS SOMETHING AND 

1514
00:45:21,919 --> 00:45:23,153
THE REASON WE ARE HERE TODAY. 

1515
00:45:23,153 --> 00:45:24,154
AND I CAN CERTAINLY UNDERSTAND 

1516
00:45:24,154 --> 00:45:24,988
THE GENERAL PUBLIC'S OUTRAGE 

1517
00:45:24,988 --> 00:45:25,989
AND THEIR CONCERN REGARDING THE 

1518
00:45:25,989 --> 00:45:26,589
WAY CAMBRIDGE ANALYTICA 

1519
00:45:26,589 --> 00:45:27,424
REQUIRED THEIR INFORMATION BUT 

1520
00:45:27,424 --> 00:45:28,992
IF PEOPLE ARE OUTRAGED BECAUSE 

1521
00:45:28,992 --> 00:45:30,861
THEY USED THAT FOR POLITICAL 

1522
00:45:30,861 --> 00:45:31,662
REASONS, WOULD THAT BE 

1523
00:45:31,662 --> 00:45:31,995
HYPOCRITICAL? 

1524
00:45:31,995 --> 00:45:32,729
SHOULDN'T THEY BE EQUALLY 

1525
00:45:32,729 --> 00:45:33,530
OUTRAGED THAT THE OBAMA 

1526
00:45:33,530 --> 00:45:36,600
CAMPAIGN USES FACEBOOK DATA 

1527
00:45:36,600 --> 00:45:39,103
WITHOUT THEIR CONSENT IN 2012?  

1528
00:45:39,103 --> 00:45:42,439
>>  CONGRESSMAN,  WHAT I THINK 

1529
00:45:42,439 --> 00:45:43,273
PEOPLE ARE RIGHTFULLY VERY 

1530
00:45:43,273 --> 00:45:55,018
UPSET ABOUT IS THAT AN APP 

1531
00:45:55,018 --> 00:45:55,853
DEVELOPER THAT PEOPLE SHARE 

1532
00:45:55,853 --> 00:45:57,054
DATA WITH SOLD IT TO SOMEONE 

1533
00:45:57,054 --> 00:45:58,288
ELSE AND FRANKLY, WE DIDN'T DO 

1534
00:45:58,288 --> 00:45:59,289
ENOUGH TO PREVENT THAT OR 

1535
00:45:59,289 --> 00:46:00,123
UNDERSTAND IT, SOON ENOUGH. 

1536
00:46:00,123 --> 00:46:01,525
AND NOW, WE HAVE TO GO THROUGH 

1537
00:46:01,525 --> 00:46:02,759
AND PUT INTO PLACE SYSTEMS TO 

1538
00:46:02,759 --> 00:46:03,560
PREVENT THAT FROM HAPPENING 

1539
00:46:03,560 --> 00:46:04,795
AGAIN AND MAKING SURE THAT WE 

1540
00:46:04,795 --> 00:46:05,596
HAVE SUFFICIENT CONTROLS IN 

1541
00:46:05,596 --> 00:46:06,864
PLACE IN OUR ECOSYSTEM SO THAT 

1542
00:46:06,864 --> 00:46:07,464
DEVELOPERS CANNOT ABUSE 

1543
00:46:07,464 --> 00:46:07,831
PEOPLE'S DATA. 

1544
00:46:07,831 --> 00:46:08,465
>> THANK YOU. 

1545
00:46:08,465 --> 00:46:10,734
MY TIME IS EXPIRED. 

1546
00:46:10,734 --> 00:46:11,969
>> THE GENTLEMAN FROM 

1547
00:46:11,969 --> 00:46:16,573
CALIFORNIA.    

1548
00:46:16,573 --> 00:46:18,008
>>  THANK YOU, MR. CHAIRMAN AND 

1549
00:46:18,008 --> 00:46:21,445
WELCOME MR. ZUCKERBERG.  

1550
00:46:21,445 --> 00:46:22,446
THANK YOU VERY MUCH, HERE. 

1551
00:46:22,446 --> 00:46:23,680
YOU KNOW, I WAS THINKING ABOUT 

1552
00:46:23,680 --> 00:46:25,249
FACEBOOK AND HOW YOU DEVELOPED 

1553
00:46:25,249 --> 00:46:30,787
YOUR PLATFORM, A SOCIAL 

1554
00:46:30,787 --> 00:46:31,588
PLATFORM AMONGST FRIENDS AND 

1555
00:46:31,588 --> 00:46:32,422
COLLEAGUES AND JOINING A 

1556
00:46:32,422 --> 00:46:32,722
COMMUNITY. 

1557
00:46:32,722 --> 00:46:34,591
AND A LOT OF THAT WAS BASED 

1558
00:46:34,591 --> 00:46:35,091
UPON TRUST. 

1559
00:46:35,091 --> 00:46:36,059
THAT EVOLVED INTO THIS BUSINESS 

1560
00:46:36,059 --> 00:46:38,295
PLATFORM AND ONE OF THE PILLARS 

1561
00:46:38,295 --> 00:46:38,896
STILL WAS TRUST. 

1562
00:46:38,896 --> 00:46:41,999
AND I THINK EVERYONE HERE WOULD 

1563
00:46:41,999 --> 00:46:45,235
AGREE THAT TRUST IS IN SHORT 

1564
00:46:45,235 --> 00:46:46,637
SUPPLY HERE AND THAT IS WHY WE 

1565
00:46:46,637 --> 00:46:50,707
ARE HERE TODAY. 

1566
00:46:50,707 --> 00:46:57,180
YOU HAVE CONSTANTLY MAINTAINED 

1567
00:46:57,180 --> 00:46:58,215
THAT CONSUMERS OWN THE DATA 

1568
00:46:58,215 --> 00:46:59,216
THEY APPLY TO FACEBOOK AND 

1569
00:46:59,216 --> 00:47:00,250
SHOULD HAVE CONTROL OVER IT. 

1570
00:47:00,250 --> 00:47:01,451
I WANT TO UNDERSTAND WHAT THAT 

1571
00:47:01,451 --> 00:47:02,219
MEANS. 

1572
00:47:02,219 --> 00:47:08,992
TO ME, YOU WANT TO HAVE A SAY 

1573
00:47:08,992 --> 00:47:10,394
ABOUT HOW AND WHEN IT IS USED. 

1574
00:47:10,394 --> 00:47:11,428
I DON'T JUST MEAN PICTURES, 

1575
00:47:11,428 --> 00:47:17,034
EMAIL ADDRESSES, FACEBOOK GROUPS

1576
00:47:17,034 --> 00:47:17,534
OR PAGES. 

1577
00:47:17,534 --> 00:47:18,368
I UNDERSTAND THE INFORMATION 

1578
00:47:18,368 --> 00:47:19,369
PROVIDED TO FACEBOOK CAN BE 

1579
00:47:19,369 --> 00:47:20,804
USED BY ALGORITHMS TO FORM 

1580
00:47:20,804 --> 00:47:26,643
ASSUMPTIONS. NOW, DO YOU 

1581
00:47:26,643 --> 00:47:27,477
BELIEVE THAT CONSUMERS ACTUALLY 

1582
00:47:27,477 --> 00:47:28,879
OWN THEIR DATA EVEN WHEN THAT 

1583
00:47:28,879 --> 00:47:32,482
DATA HAS BEEN SUPPLEMENTED BY A 

1584
00:47:32,482 --> 00:47:37,020
DATA BROKER, ASSUMPTIONS 

1585
00:47:37,020 --> 00:47:38,021
ALGORITHMS HAVE MADE ABOUT THE 

1586
00:47:38,021 --> 00:47:39,623
USER OR OTHERWISE AND THIS IS 

1587
00:47:39,623 --> 00:47:41,658
KIND OF THE QUESTION THAT MS. 

1588
00:47:41,658 --> 00:47:43,427
BLACKBURN HAS COME UP WITH OUR 

1589
00:47:43,427 --> 00:47:44,928
OWN COMPREHENSIVE PROFILE WHICH 

1590
00:47:44,928 --> 00:47:56,139
IS KIND OF OUR VIRTUAL SELF? 

1591
00:47:56,139 --> 00:47:56,940
>> CONGRESSWOMAN, I BELIEVE 

1592
00:47:56,940 --> 00:47:57,941
THAT PEOPLE OWN THEIR OWN 

1593
00:47:57,941 --> 00:47:58,208
CONTENT. 

1594
00:47:58,208 --> 00:47:59,142
WHERE THIS GETS COMPLICATED -- 

1595
00:47:59,142 --> 00:48:00,777
LET'S SAY I TAKE A PHOTO AND I 

1596
00:48:00,777 --> 00:48:01,378
SHARED WITH YOU. 

1597
00:48:01,378 --> 00:48:03,013
IS THAT MY PHOTO OR IS IT YOUR 

1598
00:48:03,013 --> 00:48:03,246
PHOTO? 

1599
00:48:03,246 --> 00:48:04,414
I WOULD TAKE THE POSITION THAT 

1600
00:48:04,414 --> 00:48:08,485
IT IS OUR PHOTO IN THAT I CAN 

1601
00:48:08,485 --> 00:48:09,720
BRING THAT PHOTO TO ANOTHER APP 

1602
00:48:09,720 --> 00:48:16,426
IF I WANT BUT YOU CAN'T. 

1603
00:48:16,426 --> 00:48:17,828
>> ONCE IT GOES TO THE DATA 

1604
00:48:17,828 --> 00:48:18,228
BROKER, THOUGH. 

1605
00:48:18,228 --> 00:48:19,062
THERE ARE CERTAIN ALGORITHMS 

1606
00:48:19,062 --> 00:48:19,729
AND CERTAIN ASSUMPTIONS. 

1607
00:48:19,729 --> 00:48:22,933
WHAT HAPPENED AFTER THAT?    

1608
00:48:22,933 --> 00:48:23,767
>>  I'M SORRY. 

1609
00:48:23,767 --> 00:48:24,468
CAN YOU CLARIFY THAT? 

1610
00:48:24,468 --> 00:48:30,440
>> WHAT I MEAN  IS, IF YOU 

1611
00:48:30,440 --> 00:48:31,641
SUPPLEMENT THIS DATA -- YOU SAY 

1612
00:48:31,641 --> 00:48:32,876
YOU OWN IT BUT YOU SUPPLEMENT 

1613
00:48:32,876 --> 00:48:33,877
THIS DATA AND OTHER DATA 

1614
00:48:33,877 --> 00:48:36,513
BROKERS USE THEIR OWN 

1615
00:48:36,513 --> 00:48:37,347
ALGORITHMS TO MAKE ASSUMPTIONS. 

1616
00:48:37,347 --> 00:48:47,090
THEN, WHAT HAPPENS THERE? 

1617
00:48:47,090 --> 00:48:48,291
TO ME, SOMEONE ELSE HAS TAKEN 

1618
00:48:48,291 --> 00:48:48,692
IT OVER. 

1619
00:48:48,692 --> 00:48:50,127
HOW CAN YOU SAY THAT WE OWN 

1620
00:48:50,127 --> 00:48:50,427
THAT DATA? 

1621
00:48:50,427 --> 00:48:51,361
>> CONGRESSWOMAN, ALL OF THE 

1622
00:48:51,361 --> 00:48:52,996
DATA THAT YOU PUT IN AND ALL OF 

1623
00:48:52,996 --> 00:48:54,231
THE CONTENT THAT YOU PUT ON 

1624
00:48:54,231 --> 00:48:54,831
FACEBOOK IS YOURS. 

1625
00:48:54,831 --> 00:48:57,067
YOU CAN REMOVE IT AT ANY TIME. 

1626
00:48:57,067 --> 00:48:58,502
YOU CAN GET RID OF YOUR ACCOUNT 

1627
00:48:58,502 --> 00:49:00,937
AND GET RID OF IT ALL AT ONCE. 

1628
00:49:00,937 --> 00:49:02,305
>> YOU CANNOT GET IT BACK ONCE 

1629
00:49:02,305 --> 00:49:03,340
IT IS OUT THERE, WRITES? 

1630
00:49:03,340 --> 00:49:05,375
THAT'S REALLY -- WE MIGHT OWN 

1631
00:49:05,375 --> 00:49:08,378
OUR OWN DATA BUT ONCE IT IS 

1632
00:49:08,378 --> 00:49:13,083
USED AND IN ADVERTISING, WE 

1633
00:49:13,083 --> 00:49:15,886
LOSE CONTROL OVER IT. IS THAT 

1634
00:49:15,886 --> 00:49:16,887
NOT RIGHT?

1635
00:49:16,887 --> 00:49:20,257
>> CONGRESSWOMAN, I WOULD 

1636
00:49:20,257 --> 00:49:24,861
DISAGREE. 

1637
00:49:24,861 --> 00:49:25,896
WE DON'T SELL DATA TO 

1638
00:49:25,896 --> 00:49:26,263
ADVERTISERS. 

1639
00:49:26,263 --> 00:49:27,697
ADVERTISERS DON'T GET ACCESS TO 

1640
00:49:27,697 --> 00:49:31,601
YOUR DATA. 

1641
00:49:31,601 --> 00:49:32,436
THERE IS A CORE 

1642
00:49:32,436 --> 00:49:33,236
MISUNDERSTANDING ABOUT HOW THAT 

1643
00:49:33,236 --> 00:49:33,603
SYSTEM WORKS. 

1644
00:49:33,603 --> 00:49:35,238
IF YOU ARE A SHOP AND YOU ARE 

1645
00:49:35,238 --> 00:49:36,239
SELLING MUFFINS, YOU MIGHT WANT 

1646
00:49:36,239 --> 00:49:37,474
TO TARGET PEOPLE IN A SPECIFIC 

1647
00:49:37,474 --> 00:49:39,108
TOWN WHO MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN 

1648
00:49:39,108 --> 00:49:43,346
BAKING OR SOME DEMOGRAPHIC. 

1649
00:49:43,346 --> 00:49:44,381
BUT WE DON'T SEND THAT 

1650
00:49:44,381 --> 00:49:45,549
INFORMATION TO YOU. 

1651
00:49:45,549 --> 00:49:48,652
WE JUST SHOW THE MESSAGE TO THE 

1652
00:49:48,652 --> 00:49:50,420
RIGHT PEOPLE AND THAT IS A 

1653
00:49:50,420 --> 00:49:51,888
REALLY IMPORTANT 

1654
00:49:51,888 --> 00:49:52,689
MISUNDERSTANDING OF HOW THE 

1655
00:49:52,689 --> 00:49:53,590
SYSTEM WORKS. 

1656
00:49:53,590 --> 00:49:57,994
>> FACEBOOK IS BASING -- AT 

1657
00:49:57,994 --> 00:50:02,265
LEAST ON THE DATA -- THE MORE 

1658
00:50:02,265 --> 00:50:13,210
COLLECTED, ALLOWING BETTER 

1659
00:50:13,210 --> 00:50:14,244
TARGETS ABUSES OR CLASSES OF 

1660
00:50:14,244 --> 00:50:15,245
USERS SO EVEN IF FACEBOOK 

1661
00:50:15,245 --> 00:50:16,246
DOESN'T EARN MONEY FROM SELLING 

1662
00:50:16,246 --> 00:50:17,080
DATA, DOESN'T FACEBOOK EARN 

1663
00:50:17,080 --> 00:50:18,081
MONEY FROM ADVERTISING BASED ON 

1664
00:50:18,081 --> 00:50:18,949
THAT DATA?>>YES CONGRESSWOMAN, 

1665
00:50:18,949 --> 00:50:19,716
WE RUN ADS. 

1666
00:50:19,716 --> 00:50:21,084
THAT'S THE BUSINESS MODEL, 

1667
00:50:21,084 --> 00:50:24,588
RUNNING ADS. 

1668
00:50:24,588 --> 00:50:25,989
AND WE USE THE DATA THAT PEOPLE 

1669
00:50:25,989 --> 00:50:27,424
PUT INTO THE SYSTEM IN ORDER TO 

1670
00:50:27,424 --> 00:50:28,425
MAKE THE ADS MORE RELEVANT 

1671
00:50:28,425 --> 00:50:29,860
WHICH ALSO MAKES THEM MORE 

1672
00:50:29,860 --> 00:50:31,094
VALUABLE BUT WHAT WE HEAR FROM 

1673
00:50:31,094 --> 00:50:32,295
PEOPLE IS THAT THEY WILL SEE 

1674
00:50:32,295 --> 00:50:33,763
THE ADS AND THEY WANT THEM TO 

1675
00:50:33,763 --> 00:50:35,198
BE GOOD AND RELEVANT. 

1676
00:50:35,198 --> 00:50:36,967
>> BUT WE ARE NOT CONTROLLING 

1677
00:50:36,967 --> 00:50:38,101
THAT DATA? 

1678
00:50:38,101 --> 00:50:42,873
>> NO, YOU HAVE COMPLETE 

1679
00:50:42,873 --> 00:50:43,373
CONTROL OVER THAT! 

1680
00:50:43,373 --> 00:50:44,274
>> AS PREVIOUSLY AGREED, WE 

1681
00:50:44,274 --> 00:50:45,709
WILL TAKE A FIVE MINUTE RECESS 

1682
00:50:45,709 --> 00:50:47,710
AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS AND A 

1683
00:50:47,710 --> 00:50:50,981
WITNESS NEEDS TO PLAN TO BE 

1684
00:50:50,981 --> 00:50:52,415
BACK IN ABOUT FIVE MINUTES. 

1685
00:50:52,415 --> 00:50:54,217
WE STAND IN RECESS. 

1686
00:51:01,791 --> 00:51:02,993
>>  YOU HAVE BEEN LISTENING TO 

1687
00:51:02,993 --> 00:51:08,932
MARK SUCKER BERG . DAY #2 OF HIS

1688
00:51:08,932 --> 00:51:16,039
-- FIRST IMPRESSIONS -- MARK 

1689
00:51:16,039 --> 00:51:22,479
ZUCKERBERG, DAY #2 OF HIS 

1690
00:51:22,479 --> 00:51:22,779
TESTIMONY. 

1691
00:51:22,779 --> 00:51:23,513
>> IF NOT MORE TECHNOLOGICAL 

1692
00:51:23,513 --> 00:51:28,251
SAVVY, WE CERTAINLY GOT A MORE 

1693
00:51:28,251 --> 00:51:29,586
DIVERSE GROUP OF QUESTIONS AND 

1694
00:51:29,586 --> 00:51:31,221
TOUGHER THAN YESTERDAY. 

1695
00:51:31,221 --> 00:51:33,857
>> JENNA, WHAT ABOUT YOU?    

1696
00:51:33,857 --> 00:51:37,727
>>  LESS FILIBUSTERING . MARK 

1697
00:51:37,727 --> 00:51:38,728
ZUCKERBERG WAS STEERING THE 

1698
00:51:38,728 --> 00:51:45,769
CONVERSATION MORE, YESTERDAY.   

1699
00:51:45,769 --> 00:51:47,671
>>  I CAN TELL YOU THAT HE IS 

1700
00:51:47,671 --> 00:51:49,906
SMILING A LOT LESS  TODAY. HE 

1701
00:51:49,906 --> 00:51:51,407
SOUNDS A LITTLE MORE PANSEAR 

1702
00:51:51,407 --> 00:51:51,774
TODAY. 

1703
00:51:51,774 --> 00:51:57,013
LIKE THE QUESTIONS ARE FINALLY 

1704
00:51:57,013 --> 00:51:57,714
GETTING UNDER HIS SKIN. 

1705
00:51:57,714 --> 00:51:59,248
>> THIS QUESTION ABOUT DATA AND 

1706
00:51:59,248 --> 00:52:03,920
OWNERSHIP, I DON'T THINK THEY 

1707
00:52:03,920 --> 00:52:05,121
GOT DEEP INTO IT, AND THE 

1708
00:52:05,121 --> 00:52:05,354
SENATE. 

1709
00:52:05,354 --> 00:52:06,756
HE KEEPS SAYING THAT WE OWN OUR 

1710
00:52:06,756 --> 00:52:10,627
OWN DATA AND THAT WE DON'T SELL 

1711
00:52:10,627 --> 00:52:10,827
DATA. 

1712
00:52:10,827 --> 00:52:13,930
YEAH, BUT YOU RENTED, SORT OF. 

1713
00:52:13,930 --> 00:52:15,332
>> HE ALSO SAID THAT YOU HAVE 

1714
00:52:15,332 --> 00:52:16,132
COMPLETE CONTROL OF IT. 

1715
00:52:16,132 --> 00:52:17,534
WE WOULDN'T BE HERE TODAY IF WE 

1716
00:52:17,534 --> 00:52:19,569
HAD COMPLETE CONTROL OF IT. 

1717
00:52:19,569 --> 00:52:22,405
IT IS A QUESTIO OF THE APIS. 

1718
00:52:22,405 --> 00:52:32,148
HE HAS HAD TOO MUCH TIME ABOUT 

1719
00:52:32,148 --> 00:52:33,183
HOW YOU CAN CONTROL EXACTLY 

1720
00:52:33,183 --> 00:52:33,783
WHAT YOU POST. 

1721
00:52:33,783 --> 00:52:35,185
IT IS DATA ALLOWED OUT OF THE 

1722
00:52:35,185 --> 00:52:36,419
COMPANY INTO THE HANDS OF THE 

1723
00:52:36,419 --> 00:52:37,420
DEVELOPERS AND IT WAS PASSED 

1724
00:52:37,420 --> 00:52:37,620
ON. 

1725
00:52:37,620 --> 00:52:38,655
>> THAT IS AN INCREDIBLE POINT. 

1726
00:52:38,655 --> 00:52:39,656
WE ARE FOCUSED ON CAMBRIDGE 

1727
00:52:39,656 --> 00:52:40,690
ANALYTICA AND THE OTHER BAD 

1728
00:52:40,690 --> 00:52:42,058
ACTORS BUT THE DEVELOPER 

1729
00:52:42,058 --> 00:52:50,267
PLATFORM WILL -- WAS DESIGNED 

1730
00:52:50,267 --> 00:52:51,468
TO ALLOW TENS OF THOUSANDS OF 

1731
00:52:51,468 --> 00:52:52,702
DEVELOPERS TO HAVE ACCESS TO A 

1732
00:52:52,702 --> 00:52:53,503
SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF YOUR 

1733
00:52:53,503 --> 00:52:53,870
PROFILE DATA. 

1734
00:52:53,870 --> 00:52:56,106
ONCE THAT IS EXTRACTED AND PUT 

1735
00:52:56,106 --> 00:52:57,340
ON ANY OTHER SERVER, THERE IS 

1736
00:52:57,340 --> 00:52:58,742
NO CONTROL OVER WHO HAS THAT 

1737
00:52:58,742 --> 00:52:59,776
AND THE SOPHISTICATION OF THE 

1738
00:52:59,776 --> 00:53:02,212
PEOPLE WHO HAVE THAT.    

1739
00:53:02,212 --> 00:53:03,980
>>  YOU SAW THE QUESTIONS 

1740
00:53:03,980 --> 00:53:06,883
YESTERDAY . TRYING TO GET 

1741
00:53:06,883 --> 00:53:08,318
BEHIND HOW THIS IS HANDLED IN A 

1742
00:53:08,318 --> 00:53:08,851
THIRD-PARTY PERSPECTIVE. 

1743
00:53:08,851 --> 00:53:13,890
IT DOESN'T REALLY ANSWER THAT.  

1744
00:53:13,890 --> 00:53:15,959
>>  AND FELT ALSO, AT SOME 

1745
00:53:15,959 --> 00:53:19,062
POINT,  MUCH LIKE THE SENATE 

1746
00:53:19,062 --> 00:53:20,329
WAS SORT OF SERIOUS EVEN THOUGH 

1747
00:53:20,329 --> 00:53:21,765
THERE WAS SOME QUESTION THAT 

1748
00:53:21,765 --> 00:53:22,565
THE SENATORS UNDERSTAND EXACTLY 

1749
00:53:22,565 --> 00:53:25,001
THE MODEL OF THE FACEBOOK 

1750
00:53:25,001 --> 00:53:25,868
BUSINESS MODEL. 

1751
00:53:25,868 --> 00:53:28,905
POLITICS SORT OF SEEP INTO THIS.

1752
00:53:28,905 --> 00:53:30,240
YOU HAD A COUPLE OF PEOPLE 

1753
00:53:30,240 --> 00:53:36,079
SUGGESTING THAT DIAMOND AND 

1754
00:53:36,079 --> 00:53:40,383
SILK --    

1755
00:53:40,383 --> 00:53:42,385
>>  WE HAVEN'T HEARD MUCH FROM 

1756
00:53:42,385 --> 00:53:43,653
THEM .    

1757
00:53:43,653 --> 00:53:47,524
>>  THAT THEY ARE  -- THAT 

1758
00:53:47,524 --> 00:53:48,924
THEIR ACTIVITY ON FACEBOOK WAS 

1759
00:53:48,924 --> 00:53:50,360
REMOVED BECAUSE OF WHATEVER 

1760
00:53:50,360 --> 00:53:55,865
CONTENT THESE FOLKS WHO MANAGE, 

1761
00:53:55,865 --> 00:53:57,100
THAT YOU SEE ON FACEBOOK AND 

1762
00:53:57,100 --> 00:53:58,101
THERE IS SOME SUGGESTION THAT 

1763
00:53:58,101 --> 00:54:00,904
THEY WERE CONSERVATIVE. 

1764
00:54:00,904 --> 00:54:02,271
IS THAT WHAT THIS IS ALL ABOUT? 

1765
00:54:02,271 --> 00:54:03,773
>> DEFINITELY A LITTLE BIT OF 

1766
00:54:03,773 --> 00:54:05,375
GRANDSTANDING. 

1767
00:54:05,375 --> 00:54:06,609
THAT'S WHY THE TOPICS SEEM TO 

1768
00:54:06,609 --> 00:54:10,447
BE FAIRLY WIDE. 

1769
00:54:10,447 --> 00:54:10,880
CONVERSATIONS ABOUT 

1770
00:54:10,880 --> 00:54:13,283
DISCRIMINATION, A TOPIC ABOUT 

1771
00:54:13,283 --> 00:54:15,318
DIVERSITY IN THE WORKFORCE. 

1772
00:54:15,318 --> 00:54:22,859
BUT THE COMPLETE IS FAR FROM 

1773
00:54:22,859 --> 00:54:24,060
WHAT WE ARE SUPPOSED TO BE 

1774
00:54:24,060 --> 00:54:24,594
TALKING ABOUT TODAY. 

1775
00:54:24,594 --> 00:54:25,695
>> I THINK WE WERE ALL 

1776
00:54:25,695 --> 00:54:26,529
SURPRISED WHEN MARK ZUCKERBERG 

1777
00:54:26,529 --> 00:54:33,670
WAS ASKED ABOUT MULTIMILLIONS 

1778
00:54:33,670 --> 00:54:34,838
OF DOLLARS AND HE COULD NOT 

1779
00:54:34,838 --> 00:54:35,671
TALK ABOUT THOSE SETTLEMENTS. 

1780
00:54:35,671 --> 00:54:36,539
THAT WAS SHOCKING TO ME. 

1781
00:54:36,539 --> 00:54:37,874
>> HIS EYES ARE NOT ON THE 

1782
00:54:37,874 --> 00:54:38,341
ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS. 

1783
00:54:38,341 --> 00:54:46,015
HE IS LOOKING AHEAD INTO HOW HE 

1784
00:54:46,015 --> 00:54:47,016
IS GOING TO GROW FACEBOOK. 

1785
00:54:47,016 --> 00:54:48,651
I THINK HE NEEDS TO TAKE A LOOK 

1786
00:54:48,651 --> 00:54:50,053
AT SOME OF THE RISKS IN HIS 

1787
00:54:50,053 --> 00:54:53,123
PLATFORM AND OBVIOUSLY PAY MORE 

1788
00:54:53,123 --> 00:54:53,623
ATTENTION TO THAT. 

1789
00:54:53,623 --> 00:54:55,158
>> DO YOU THINK THAT IS WHY WE 

1790
00:54:55,158 --> 00:54:55,759
ARE HERE NOW? 

1791
00:54:55,759 --> 00:54:57,160
HE HAS BEEN SAYING THAT IN HIS 

1792
00:54:57,160 --> 00:54:57,460
APOLOGIES. 

1793
00:54:57,460 --> 00:54:59,062
WE DROPPED THE BALL, BLAH BLAH 

1794
00:54:59,062 --> 00:55:00,597
BLAH. 

1795
00:55:00,597 --> 00:55:02,098
AND OKAY. 

1796
00:55:02,098 --> 00:55:04,067
IT WAS SORT OF HARD TO BELIEVE 

1797
00:55:04,067 --> 00:55:06,136
BUT NOW, HE COULDN'T TALK ABOUT 

1798
00:55:06,136 --> 00:55:08,538
THE DETAILS OF SETTLEMENT, NOT 

1799
00:55:08,538 --> 00:55:13,843
THE FTC AGREEMENT IN 2011! WHAT 

1800
00:55:13,843 --> 00:55:14,176
IS THAT?! 

1801
00:55:14,176 --> 00:55:16,012
>> GOING BACK TO ONE THING THAT 

1802
00:55:16,012 --> 00:55:25,021
JENNA SAID A FEW TIMES, IT IS 

1803
00:55:25,021 --> 00:55:25,655
INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT, SAFETY. 

1804
00:55:25,655 --> 00:55:26,823
AND THIS IS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR 

1805
00:55:26,823 --> 00:55:27,657
MR. ZUCKERBERG TO DEFEND 

1806
00:55:27,657 --> 00:55:30,894
HIMSELF AND DEFEND HIS COMPANY 

1807
00:55:30,894 --> 00:55:32,128
BUT WE HAD NOT HEARD HIM 

1808
00:55:32,128 --> 00:55:32,729
EMPATHIZE WITH HUMANS. 

1809
00:55:32,729 --> 00:55:38,034
FACEBOOK IS COMPOSED OF 200 

1810
00:55:38,034 --> 00:55:42,071
BILLION USERS, AS THEY LIKE TO 

1811
00:55:42,071 --> 00:55:42,271
SAY. 

1812
00:55:42,271 --> 00:55:43,473
USERS ARE STATS, ALL ARE HUMANS 

1813
00:55:43,473 --> 00:55:44,707
AND ALL OF THOSE HUMANS HAVE 

1814
00:55:44,707 --> 00:55:45,742
FOLDER ABILITIES THAT EACH ONE 

1815
00:55:45,742 --> 00:55:47,343
OF US CAN RELATE TO AND WHAT HE 

1816
00:55:47,343 --> 00:55:48,344
IS NOT DOING IS EMPATHIZING 

1817
00:55:48,344 --> 00:55:49,345
WITH THE HUMANS ON FACEBOOK. 

1818
00:55:49,345 --> 00:55:51,013
>> AND HE SAID YESTERDAY, I USE 

1819
00:55:51,013 --> 00:55:54,250
IT. MY FAMILY USES IT. 

1820
00:55:54,250 --> 00:55:56,019
BUT HE HAS SPECIAL PRIVILEGES 

1821
00:55:56,019 --> 00:56:00,957
THE NOTION ON THE PLATFORM. 

1822
00:56:00,957 --> 00:56:02,625
AND ONLY BECAUSE OF THE CHECK 

1823
00:56:02,625 --> 00:56:18,842
RON ARE WE GOING TO GET THAT 

1824
00:56:18,842 --> 00:56:19,075
OPTION. 

1825
00:56:19,075 --> 00:56:20,477
I THINK ONE OF THEM HAD REALLY 

1826
00:56:20,477 --> 00:56:21,678
NAILED IT AND SAID PRIVACY BY 

1827
00:56:21,678 --> 00:56:22,078
PRESS RELEASE. 

1828
00:56:22,078 --> 00:56:23,713
SO I REALLY HAVE TO GIVE A NOD 

1829
00:56:23,713 --> 00:56:24,714
TO THE TECH JOURNALISTS OUT 

1830
00:56:24,714 --> 00:56:25,748
THERE WHO HAVE BEEN DRIVING 

1831
00:56:25,748 --> 00:56:26,749
FORWARD AND DOING THESE 

1832
00:56:26,749 --> 00:56:27,349
INVESTIGATIONS EVEN STARTING 

1833
00:56:27,349 --> 00:56:28,184
WITH THE GUARDIAN OVERSEAS WHO 

1834
00:56:28,184 --> 00:56:28,818
LAUNCHED CAMBRIDGE ANALYTICA. 

1835
00:56:28,818 --> 00:56:29,051
RIGHT? 

1836
00:56:29,051 --> 00:56:29,819
PRIVACY BY PRESS RELEASE. 

1837
00:56:29,819 --> 00:56:30,620
FACEBOOK IS ACTIVELY MANAGING 

1838
00:56:30,620 --> 00:56:31,020
THEIR PRODUCT. 

1839
00:56:31,020 --> 00:56:35,091
THEY ARE WAITING UNTIL THERE IS 

1840
00:56:35,091 --> 00:56:36,292
A PRESS BLOWBACK AND A SCANDAL 

1841
00:56:36,292 --> 00:56:37,026
AND THEN, THEY REACT. 

1842
00:56:37,026 --> 00:56:38,561
>> IT IS ALL ABOUT GROWTH, 

1843
00:56:38,561 --> 00:56:38,828
FACEBOOK. 

1844
00:56:38,828 --> 00:56:40,429
THAT WHOLE PHILOSOPHY IS 

1845
00:56:40,429 --> 00:56:44,200
CORDLESS. 

1846
00:56:44,200 --> 00:56:50,540
-- CORDLESS. 

1847
00:56:50,540 --> 00:56:52,308
>> HE TALKS ABOUT THE MISSION 

1848
00:56:52,308 --> 00:56:54,377
AND BRINGING THINGS TOGETHER 

1849
00:56:54,377 --> 00:57:01,184
BUT WHEN PUSH COMES TO SHOVE, 

1850
00:57:01,184 --> 00:57:01,517
FACEBOOK ADS. 

1851
00:57:01,517 --> 00:57:02,719
THAT'S REALLY WHAT THEY DO AND 

1852
00:57:02,719 --> 00:57:03,920
I DON'T THINK THERE'S BEEN A 

1853
00:57:03,920 --> 00:57:04,954
LOT OF DISCUSSION AROUND THAT 

1854
00:57:04,954 --> 00:57:06,356
AS MUCH BECAUSE HE HAS DONE 

1855
00:57:06,356 --> 00:57:07,790
SUCH A GOOD JOB AND FACEBOOK IS 

1856
00:57:07,790 --> 00:57:09,192
SUCH AN IMPORTANT PART OF 

1857
00:57:09,192 --> 00:57:10,426
EVERYONE'S LIFE THAT WE KIND OF 

1858
00:57:10,426 --> 00:57:11,461
THINK OF IT THAT WAY. 

1859
00:57:11,461 --> 00:57:13,296
WE ALL LIVE IN THIS BIG AND 

1860
00:57:13,296 --> 00:57:13,930
HAPPY COMMUNITY CALLED 

1861
00:57:13,930 --> 00:57:14,664
FACEBOOK. 

1862
00:57:14,664 --> 00:57:19,135
WHEN FIRST -- WHEN PUSH COMES 

1863
00:57:19,135 --> 00:57:21,638
TO SHOVE, WE DO ACTUALLY SELL 

1864
00:57:21,638 --> 00:57:23,239
IT.    

1865
00:57:23,239 --> 00:57:28,111
>>  WRITES.  

1866
00:57:28,111 --> 00:57:29,312
BUT THAT IS PART OF THE 

1867
00:57:29,312 --> 00:57:29,579
STRATEGY. 

1868
00:57:29,579 --> 00:57:30,947
THIS IS THE FIRST TIME WE ARE 

1869
00:57:30,947 --> 00:57:32,582
SEEING HIM IN A SUIT AND A LONG 

1870
00:57:32,582 --> 00:57:32,782
TIME. 

1871
00:57:32,782 --> 00:57:37,554
BUT THIS IS ABOUT CONNECTING 

1872
00:57:37,554 --> 00:57:38,054
PEOPLE. 

1873
00:57:38,054 --> 00:57:39,055
PLEASE DON'T LOOK BEHIND THIS 

1874
00:57:39,055 --> 00:57:39,488
CURTAIN, RIGHT? 

1875
00:57:39,488 --> 00:57:40,890
BUT I THINK WHAT WE ARE SEEING 

1876
00:57:40,890 --> 00:57:42,659
HERE IS THE SORT OF VENEER 

1877
00:57:42,659 --> 00:57:45,762
FALLING APART, A LITTLE. 

1878
00:57:45,762 --> 00:57:47,030
AND I THINK THAT'S A REALLY 

1879
00:57:47,030 --> 00:57:51,434
GOOD POINT CREDITING THE 

1880
00:57:51,434 --> 00:57:57,773
JOURNALISTS AND THE LAWMAKERS. 

1881
00:57:57,773 --> 00:57:59,175
I THINK A LOT OF USERS ARE 

1882
00:57:59,175 --> 00:58:00,209
STILL VERY COMFORTABLE WITH THE 

1883
00:58:00,209 --> 00:58:01,910
CONCEPT THAT THIS IS A PLATFORM 

1884
00:58:01,910 --> 00:58:03,246
MEANT JUST TO CONNECT PEOPLE 

1885
00:58:03,246 --> 00:58:04,647
AND THAT IS ALL THAT IS SO 

1886
00:58:04,647 --> 00:58:06,282
THERE IS A PRICE TO PAY FOR IT, 

1887
00:58:06,282 --> 00:58:07,317
A LITTLE BIT OF DATA. 

1888
00:58:07,317 --> 00:58:15,224
WHAT IS DATA?    

1889
00:58:15,224 --> 00:58:16,859
>>  IT IS IN AGGREGATE, THAT IS 

1890
00:58:16,859 --> 00:58:18,061
WHAT WE ARE EXPECTING AND I 

1891
00:58:18,061 --> 00:58:19,095
HAVE TO SAY POST U.S. 

1892
00:58:19,095 --> 00:58:20,329
SELECTION, I THINK THERE IS A 

1893
00:58:20,329 --> 00:58:21,364
GENERAL SENSE  FROM END-USERS 

1894
00:58:21,364 --> 00:58:22,164
THAT THEY UNDERSTAND SOMETHING 

1895
00:58:22,164 --> 00:58:22,565
AS WELL. 

1896
00:58:22,565 --> 00:58:25,001
I THINK THAT HAS CHANGED AND I 

1897
00:58:25,001 --> 00:58:26,436
DO THINK THAT IS ONE REASON WE 

1898
00:58:26,436 --> 00:58:27,604
ARE HERE AND THAT WE HAVE 

1899
00:58:27,604 --> 00:58:28,638
TESTIMONY HAPPENING AND I AM 

1900
00:58:28,638 --> 00:58:29,839
NOT GOING TO JOIN THOSE OUT 

1901
00:58:29,839 --> 00:58:32,642
THERE RIGHT NOW SAYING THAT THE 

1902
00:58:32,642 --> 00:58:36,145
LAWMAKERS ARE -- THEY DON'T 

1903
00:58:36,145 --> 00:58:36,745
UNDERSTAND THE TECHNOLOGY. 

1904
00:58:36,745 --> 00:58:45,688
I THINK THEY DO HAVE A BIT MORE 

1905
00:58:45,688 --> 00:58:47,123
OF A CLUE AND THEY ARE ELECTED 

1906
00:58:47,123 --> 00:58:48,324
OFFICIAL SO WE NEED TO EDUCATE 

1907
00:58:48,324 --> 00:58:49,559
THEM AND HOPE THAT THEY CAN 

1908
00:58:49,559 --> 00:58:50,460
REALLY PUSH FORWARD ON THIS. 

1909
00:58:50,460 --> 00:58:51,794
>> I WOULD ARGUE THAT AMORY IS 

1910
00:58:51,794 --> 00:58:54,497
A HEAVY USER OF FACEBOOK. 

1911
00:58:54,497 --> 00:58:55,397
>> I PLEAD THE FIFTH. 

1912
00:58:55,397 --> 00:58:56,933
>> YEAH AND THAT'S A GREAT 

1913
00:58:56,933 --> 00:59:02,538
POINT. 

1914
00:59:02,538 --> 00:59:03,973
THIS COVERAGE IS GOING TO BE A 

1915
00:59:03,973 --> 00:59:04,974
LOT ABOUT HOW PEOPLE ARE 

1916
00:59:04,974 --> 00:59:06,009
RECTING ON SOCIAL MEDIA AND 

1917
00:59:06,009 --> 00:59:06,309
ELSEWHERE. 

1918
00:59:06,309 --> 00:59:07,009
AND PEOPLE WERE REACTING 

1919
00:59:07,009 --> 00:59:12,081
YESTERDAY, LESS SO TODAY BUT 

1920
00:59:12,081 --> 00:59:13,516
THE POINT IS WELL TAKEN AND YOU 

1921
00:59:13,516 --> 00:59:14,550
MADE THE POINT EARLIER THAT 

1922
00:59:14,550 --> 00:59:16,119
THESE ARE ELECTED OFFICIALS WHO 

1923
00:59:16,119 --> 00:59:19,622
REPRESENT US AND USE FACEBOOK. 

1924
00:59:19,622 --> 00:59:20,823
THERE WAS ONE POINT MADE I 

1925
00:59:20,823 --> 00:59:25,294
THINK WHEN THEY WELCOMED MR. 

1926
00:59:25,294 --> 00:59:26,529
ZUCKERBERG TO THE TABLE AND HE 

1927
00:59:26,529 --> 00:59:27,563
SAID, WE RECOGNIZE HOW YOUR 

1928
00:59:27,563 --> 00:59:30,833
COMPANY IS A GREAT AMERICAN 

1929
00:59:30,833 --> 00:59:32,035
STORY BECAUSE IT IS SUCH AN 

1930
00:59:32,035 --> 00:59:33,236
INTEGRAL PART OF OUR LIVES. 

1931
00:59:33,236 --> 00:59:36,272
LET'S TAKE A QUICK BREAK. 

1932
00:59:36,272 --> 00:59:39,509
ROGER, DAN PATTERSON. 

1933
00:59:39,509 --> 00:59:40,743
WE WILL COME BACK AND CONTINUE 

1934
00:59:40,743 --> 00:59:41,911
TO FOLLOW UP. 

1935
00:59:41,911 --> 00:59:46,215
BIG NEWS. PAUL RYAN IS NOT 

1936
00:59:46,215 --> 00:59:47,383
RUNNING FOR REELECTION. 

1937
00:59:47,383 --> 00:59:49,886
PRESIDENT TRUMP THREATENING 

1938
00:59:49,886 --> 00:59:54,090
SYRIA WITH MISSILES ON TWITTER. 

1939
00:59:54,090 --> 00:59:55,024
STAY WITH US. 

1940
01:02:48,197 --> 01:02:48,530
>>> SURPRISE! 

1941
01:02:48,530 --> 01:02:56,139
>>  

1942
01:04:14,750 --> 01:04:16,385
>>  IT IS HARD TO BELIEVE BUT I 

1943
01:04:16,385 --> 01:04:19,989
HAVE A  -- I HAVE BEEN A MEMBER 

1944
01:04:19,989 --> 01:04:28,397
OF CONGRESS. MY KIDS WERE NOT 

1945
01:04:28,397 --> 01:04:29,632
EVEN BORN WHEN I WAS FIRST 

1946
01:04:29,632 --> 01:04:29,899
ELECTED. 

1947
01:04:29,899 --> 01:04:31,033
OUR OLDEST BECAME 13 WHEN I 

1948
01:04:31,033 --> 01:04:31,433
BECAME SPEAKER. 

1949
01:04:31,433 --> 01:04:32,868
NOW, ALL THREE OF OUR KIDS ARE 

1950
01:04:32,868 --> 01:04:33,168
TEENAGERS. 

1951
01:04:33,168 --> 01:04:34,670
WHAT I REALIZE IS, IF I AM HERE 

1952
01:04:34,670 --> 01:04:37,306
FOR ONE MORE TERM, MY KIDS WILL 

1953
01:04:37,306 --> 01:04:38,741
ONLY HAVE EVER KNOWN ME AS A 

1954
01:04:38,741 --> 01:04:39,141
WEEKEND DAD. 

1955
01:04:39,141 --> 01:04:42,979
I JUST CAN'T LET THAT HAPPEN. 

1956
01:04:42,979 --> 01:04:44,914
I WILL BE SETTING NEW PRIORITIES

1957
01:04:44,914 --> 01:04:50,486
IN MY LIFE AND I AM INCREDIBLY 

1958
01:04:50,486 --> 01:04:51,987
PROUD OF WHAT WE HAVE 

1959
01:04:51,987 --> 01:04:58,828
ACCOMPLISHED. 

1960
01:04:58,828 --> 01:05:00,496
I DON'T WANT TO BE ONE OF THOSE 

1961
01:05:00,496 --> 01:05:01,731
PEOPLE LOOKING BACK ON MY LIFE 

1962
01:05:01,731 --> 01:05:04,333
THINKING I SPENT THOSE THEY 

1963
01:05:04,333 --> 01:05:06,235
WILL ONLY KNOW ME AS A WEEKEND 

1964
01:05:06,235 --> 01:05:09,805
FATHER.    

1965
01:05:09,805 --> 01:05:11,240
>>  THAT IS PAUL RYAN SPEAKING 

1966
01:05:11,240 --> 01:05:11,507
EARLIER. 

1967
01:05:11,507 --> 01:05:13,042
WE ARE GOING TO TAKE YOU BACK  

1968
01:05:13,042 --> 01:05:14,476
TO THE HOUSE COMMERCE COMMITTEE 

1969
01:05:14,476 --> 01:05:18,748
WHERE MARK ZUCKERBERG IS 

1970
01:05:18,748 --> 01:05:20,516
TESTIFYING FOR A SECOND DAY ON 

1971
01:05:20,516 --> 01:05:22,184
CAPITOL HILL.    

1972
01:05:22,184 --> 01:05:23,819
>>  WE WILL REVIEW IT AND GET 

1973
01:05:23,819 --> 01:05:26,255
BACK TO YOU.     

1974
01:05:26,255 --> 01:05:27,490
>>  THANK YOU VERY MUCH. 

1975
01:05:27,490 --> 01:05:33,796
SHALL SEND LORD APPEARED  ON 

1976
01:05:33,796 --> 01:05:34,997
THE TODAY PROGRAM LAST WEEK AND 

1977
01:05:34,997 --> 01:05:35,631
ADMITTED THAT ADDITIONAL 

1978
01:05:35,631 --> 01:05:36,432
BREACHES AND INFORMATION COULD 

1979
01:05:36,432 --> 01:05:37,966
BE DISCOVERED BY THE CURRENT 

1980
01:05:37,966 --> 01:05:39,502
AUDITS. 

1981
01:05:39,502 --> 01:05:40,535
"WE ARE DOING AN INVESTIGATION 

1982
01:05:40,535 --> 01:05:41,904
AND WE ARE GOING TO DO THE 

1983
01:05:41,904 --> 01:05:43,305
AUDITS AND WE DO THINK IT IS 

1984
01:05:43,305 --> 01:05:44,340
POSSIBLE, THAT'S WHY WE ARE 

1985
01:05:44,340 --> 01:05:45,140
DOING THE AUDITS." 

1986
01:05:45,140 --> 01:05:51,447
AND THEN, THE CEO -- THE COO 

1987
01:05:51,447 --> 01:05:52,681
WENT ON TO SAY THAT FACEBOOK 

1988
01:05:52,681 --> 01:05:54,082
CARED ABOUT THE PROPHECY, ALL 

1989
01:05:54,082 --> 01:05:57,119
ALONG. 

1990
01:05:57,119 --> 01:05:58,554
THAT I THINK WE GOT THE BALANCE 

1991
01:05:58,554 --> 01:05:58,754
LONG. 

1992
01:05:58,754 --> 01:05:59,989
DO YOU AGREE WITH THE STATEMENT 

1993
01:05:59,989 --> 01:06:03,626
OF YOUR COO?    

1994
01:06:03,626 --> 01:06:04,860
>>  YES, CONGRESSMAN, I DO. 

1995
01:06:04,860 --> 01:06:06,629
WE WERE TRYING TO BALANCE TWO 

1996
01:06:06,629 --> 01:06:07,329
EQUITIES.  

1997
01:06:07,329 --> 01:06:08,731
ON THE ONE HAND, MAKING IT SO 

1998
01:06:08,731 --> 01:06:12,001
THAT PEOPLE HAD DATA PORTABILITY

1999
01:06:12,001 --> 01:06:13,202
, THE ABILITY TO BRING THEIR 

2000
01:06:13,202 --> 01:06:14,603
DATA TO ANOTHER APP IN ORDER TO 

2001
01:06:14,603 --> 01:06:18,441
HAVE NEW EXPERIENCES WHICH I 

2002
01:06:18,441 --> 01:06:19,875
THINK IS A VALUE THAT WE ALL 

2003
01:06:19,875 --> 01:06:20,276
CARE ABOUT. 

2004
01:06:20,276 --> 01:06:21,710
ON THE OTHER HAND, WE ALSO NEED 

2005
01:06:21,710 --> 01:06:22,711
TO BALANCE MAKING SURE THAT 

2006
01:06:22,711 --> 01:06:23,345
EVERYONE'S INFORMATION IS 

2007
01:06:23,345 --> 01:06:23,645
PROTECTED. 

2008
01:06:23,645 --> 01:06:24,947
AND I THINK WE DIDN'T GET THAT 

2009
01:06:24,947 --> 01:06:27,816
BALANCE RIGHT UP FRONT. 

2010
01:06:27,816 --> 01:06:28,417
>> THANK YOU. 

2011
01:06:28,417 --> 01:06:29,418
I CERTAINLY CONCUR WITH THE 

2012
01:06:29,418 --> 01:06:30,653
STATEMENT OF THE COO AS 

2013
01:06:30,653 --> 01:06:31,854
AFFIRMED BY YOU TODAY THAT YOU 

2014
01:06:31,854 --> 01:06:33,689
HAVE THE BALANCE WRONG. 

2015
01:06:33,689 --> 01:06:34,823
AND REGARDING CAMBRIDGE 

2016
01:06:34,823 --> 01:06:44,800
ANALYTICA, THE FACT THAT 300,000

2017
01:06:44,800 --> 01:06:45,901
INDIVIDUALS OR SO GAVE CONSENT 

2018
01:06:45,901 --> 01:06:47,336
BUT THAT CERTAINLY DOES NOT 

2019
01:06:47,336 --> 01:06:49,738
INDICATE THEY GAVE CONSENT TO 

2020
01:06:49,738 --> 01:06:59,882
MILLIONS. 

2021
01:06:59,882 --> 01:07:01,517
-- IS BACK WE DO NOT BELIEVE IT 

2022
01:07:01,517 --> 01:07:01,717
DID. 

2023
01:07:01,717 --> 01:07:02,751
BUT REGARDLESS, WE TAKE A 

2024
01:07:02,751 --> 01:07:03,552
BROADER VIEW OF WHATEVER 

2025
01:07:03,552 --> 01:07:04,353
RESPONSIBILITY IS OF PROTECTING 

2026
01:07:04,353 --> 01:07:04,787
PEOPLE'S PRIVACY. 

2027
01:07:04,787 --> 01:07:05,988
IF A DEVELOPER WHO PEOPLE GAVE 

2028
01:07:05,988 --> 01:07:09,224
THEIR INFORMATION TO, ALEKSANDR 

2029
01:07:09,224 --> 01:07:10,459
KOGAN, GOES IN VIOLATION OF HIS 

2030
01:07:10,459 --> 01:07:12,093
AGREEMENT WITH US AND SELLS THE 

2031
01:07:12,093 --> 01:07:19,434
DATA TO CAMBRIDGE ANALYTICA, 

2032
01:07:19,434 --> 01:07:20,869
THAT IS A BIG ISSUE AND PEOPLE 

2033
01:07:20,869 --> 01:07:22,171
HAVE A RIGHT TO BE UPSET. 

2034
01:07:22,171 --> 01:07:23,239
I AM UPSET THAT THAT HAS 

2035
01:07:23,239 --> 01:07:24,473
HAPPENED AND WE NEED TO MAKE 

2036
01:07:24,473 --> 01:07:28,344
SURE WE PLACE SYSTEMS THAT THAT 

2037
01:07:28,344 --> 01:07:29,077
MAY NOT HAPPEN AGAIN. 

2038
01:07:29,077 --> 01:07:30,379
>> I AM SURE THAT WILL BE 

2039
01:07:30,379 --> 01:07:31,180
DETERMINED IN THE FUTURE. 

2040
01:07:31,180 --> 01:07:31,946
THANK YOU, MR. CHAIRMAN. 

2041
01:07:31,946 --> 01:07:37,286

2042
01:07:37,286 --> 01:07:38,087

01:07:42,558 --> 01:07:43,726
BUILDING COMMUNITIES AND 

2046
01:07:43,726 --> 01:07:49,899
CONNECTING FAMILIES, I THINK A 

2047
01:07:49,899 --> 01:07:50,699
DEVIL'S BARGAIN HAS BEEN 

2048
01:07:50,699 --> 01:07:50,966
STRUCK. 

2049
01:07:50,966 --> 01:07:52,134
AND IN THE END, AMERICANS DO 

2050
01:07:52,134 --> 01:07:54,970
NOT LIKE TO BE MANIPULATED. 

2051
01:07:54,970 --> 01:07:56,372
THEY DO NOT LIKE TO BE SPIED 

2052
01:07:56,372 --> 01:07:56,572
ON. 

2053
01:07:56,572 --> 01:08:01,444
WE DON'T LIKE IT WHEN SOMEONE IS

2054
01:08:01,444 --> 01:08:02,444
OUTSIDE OF OUR HOME WATCHING. 

2055
01:08:02,444 --> 01:08:03,679
WE DON'T LIKE IT WHEN SOMEONE 

2056
01:08:03,679 --> 01:08:04,680

YES, WE UNDERSTAND THE FACEBOOK 

2065
01:08:22,096 --> 01:08:27,069
USERS THAT PROACTIVELY SIGN IN

2067
01:08:28,237 --> 01:08:29,071
YOU ARE FOLLOWING FACEBOOK

2071
01:08:39,147 --> 01:08:40,015

INFORMATION ON PEOPLE WHO DO 

2073
01:08:41,050 --> 01:08:41,850
NOT EVEN HAVE FACEBOOK 

2074
01:08:41,850 --> 01:08:43,219

2075
01:08:43,219 --> 01:08:48,991

PURPOSES AND COMMERCIAL 

2085
01:09:03,171 --> 01:09:03,439
PURPOSES. 

2086
01:09:03,439 --> 01:09:04,607
SO YOU ARE COLLECTING DATA WHEN 

2087
01:09:04,607 --> 01:09:07,243
SOMEONE GOES TO A WEBSITE AND 

2088
01:09:07,243 --> 01:09:08,477

AMERICAN REALLY UNDERSTANDS 

2097
01:09:28,229 --> 01:09:28,631
THAT, TODAY. 

2098
01:09:28,631 --> 01:09:29,231
SOMETHING THAT FUNDAMENTAL. 

2099
01:09:29,231 --> 01:09:30,265
AND THAT YOU ARE TRACKING 

2100
01:09:30,265 --> 01:09:30,899

WITH US . 

2108
01:09:46,481 --> 01:09:48,082
>> IT HAS A SHARE BUTTON SO IT 

2109
01:09:48,082 --> 01:09:49,117
IS GATHERING INFORMATION. 

2110
01:09:49,117 --> 01:09:51,319
IN FACT, YOU HAVE PATENTED 

2111
01:09:51,319 --> 01:09:58,327
APPLICATIONS TO DO JUST THAT.   

2112
01:09:58,327 --> 01:10:00,062

2113
01:10:00,062 --> 01:10:00,795
BUTTONS SHARE TRANSACTION DATA. 

2114
01:10:00,795 --> 01:10:02,331

COLLECTING MEDICAL DATA FOR 

2116
01:10:05,567 --> 01:10:06,401
THOSE ON THE INTERNET. 

2117
01:10:06,401 --> 01:10:07,403
WHETHER THEY ARE FACEBOOK USERS 

2118
01:10:07,403 --> 01:10:09,605
OR NOT, RIGHT?    

2119
01:10:09,605 --> 01:10:13,576

2120
01:10:13,576 --> 01:10:15,077

2121
01:10:15,077 --> 01:10:16,312
YOU WATCH WHERE WE GO?  

2122
01:10:16,312 --> 01:10:19,148
THE SENATOR HAD A BUNNY 

2123
01:10:19,148 --> 01:10:19,982
QUESTION ABOUT WHERE YOU'RE 

2124
01:10:19,982 --> 01:10:21,183
STAYING AND YOU DIDN'T WANT TO 

2125
01:10:21,183 --> 01:10:24,453
SHARE THAT BUT FACEBOOK ALSO 

2126
01:10:24,453 --> 01:10:25,454
SHARES DATA ABOUT WHERE WE 

2127
01:10:25,454 --> 01:10:26,221
TRAVEL, IS THAT CORRECT? 

2128
01:10:26,221 --> 01:10:28,090
>> EVERYONE HAS CONTROL OF THAT

2129
01:10:28,090 --> 01:10:28,290
. 

2130
01:10:28,290 --> 01:10:34,430
>> I WILL GET TO THAT BUT YES, 

2131
01:10:34,430 --> 01:10:35,631
THAT IS THE BUSINESS YOU ARE 

2132
01:10:35,631 --> 01:10:37,032
IN, GATHERING DATA AND 

2133
01:10:37,032 --> 01:10:38,834
AGGREGATING DATA? RIGHT? 

2134
01:10:38,834 --> 01:10:39,535
>> CONGRESSWOMAN, I DISAGREE 

2135
01:10:39,535 --> 01:10:41,737
WITH THAT CHARACTERIZATION. 

2136
01:10:41,737 --> 01:10:43,339
>> YOU ARE SAYING YOU DID NOT 

2137
01:10:43,339 --> 01:10:47,409
GATHER DATA BASED UPON THE 

2138
01:10:47,409 --> 01:10:48,410
INTERNET AND WAYS THAT THEY 

2139
01:10:48,410 --> 01:10:50,179
SIGN IN AND THINGS LIKE THAT?   

2140
01:10:50,179 --> 01:10:52,681
>>  PEOPLE CHOOSE TO SHARE DATA 

2141
01:10:52,681 --> 01:10:52,881
. 

2142
01:10:52,881 --> 01:10:53,882
>> THAT'S THE PRIMARY WAY BUT 

2143
01:10:53,882 --> 01:10:57,553
THE OTHER WAY THAT FACEBOOK 

2144
01:10:57,553 --> 01:10:58,754
GATHERS DATA IS THAT YOU BUY 

2145
01:10:58,754 --> 01:11:01,824
DATA FROM DATA BROKERS OUTSIDE 

2146
01:11:01,824 --> 01:11:02,591
OF THE PLATFORM, CORRECT? 

2147
01:11:02,591 --> 01:11:06,295
>> WE JUST ANNOUNCED TWO WEEKS 

2148
01:11:06,295 --> 01:11:07,730
AGO THAT WE WERE GOING TO STOP 

2149
01:11:07,730 --> 01:11:10,999
INTERACTING WITH DATA BROKERS 

2150
01:11:10,999 --> 01:11:12,201
AND EVEN THOUGH THAT IS AN 

2151
01:11:12,201 --> 01:11:13,435
INDUSTRY NORM TO MAKE IT SO 

2152
01:11:13,435 --> 01:11:14,837
THAT THE ADVERTISING CAN BE 

2153
01:11:14,837 --> 01:11:15,771
MORE RELEVANT.   

2154
01:11:15,771 --> 01:11:17,039
>>  SEE, IT IS PRACTICALLY 

2155
01:11:17,039 --> 01:11:20,209
IMPOSSIBLE THESE DAYS TO REMAIN 

2156
01:11:20,209 --> 01:11:20,909
UNTRACKED IN AMERICA. 

2157
01:11:20,909 --> 01:11:22,144
FOR ALL OF THE BENEFITS THAT 

2158
01:11:22,144 --> 01:11:27,816
FACEBOOK HAS BROUGHT TO THE 

2159
01:11:27,816 --> 01:11:29,051
INTERNET AND THAT IS NOT PART 

2160
01:11:29,051 --> 01:11:30,252
OF THE BARGAIN AND CURRENT LAWS 

2161
01:11:30,252 --> 01:11:31,286

01:11:31,286 --> 01:11:32,855
CURRENT LAWS HAVE NOT ADOPTED

TO ADDRESS DIGITAL SURVEILLANCE 

2164
01:11:36,591 --> 01:11:37,359
AND CONGRESS SHOULD ACT. 

2165
01:11:37,359 --> 01:11:38,794
AND I DO NOT BELIEVE THAT THE 

2166
01:11:38,794 --> 01:11:43,899
CONTROLS, THE OPAQUE AGREEMENT, 

2167
01:11:43,899 --> 01:11:44,700
THE CONSENT AGREEMENT AND

2173
01:11:55,043 --> 01:11:56,812

2174
01:11:56,812 --> 01:11:58,113
CONSTITUENTS CONSENT. 

2175
01:11:58,113 --> 01:12:02,751

>>  THANKS FOR BEING HERE. 

2177
01:12:03,986 --> 01:12:07,423
WHEN I FIRST GOT INTO  PUBLIC 

2178
01:12:07,423 --> 01:12:08,424
OFFICE, A LOT OF PEOPLE 

2179
01:12:08,424 --> 01:12:09,657
COMPLAINED ABOUT ADS, THE 

2180
01:12:09,657 --> 01:12:12,327
INCONVENIENCE. I REMEMBER 

2181
01:12:12,327 --> 01:12:18,000
TELLING SOMEONE ONE TIME, 

2182
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:19,067
THERE'S NOTHING I HATE WORSE 

2183
01:12:19,067 --> 01:12:20,068
THAN THE FOUR MINUTE TIMEOUT, 

2184
01:12:20,068 --> 01:12:25,507
THE TV TIMEOUT. 

2185
01:12:25,507 --> 01:12:26,708
BUT BECAUSE OF THE FOUR MINUTE 

2186
01:12:26,708 --> 01:12:27,943
TIMEOUT, I GET TO WATCH THE 

2187
01:12:27,943 --> 01:12:29,144
GAME FOR FREE SO THAT IS 

2188
01:12:29,144 --> 01:12:30,379
SOMETHING THAT I AM WILLING TO 

2189
01:12:30,379 --> 01:12:30,612
ACCEPT. 

2190
01:12:30,612 --> 01:12:32,014
IF YOU ARE NOT WILLING TO 

2191
01:12:32,014 --> 01:12:33,215
ACCEPT YOUR DATA OUT THERE AND 

2192
01:12:33,215 --> 01:12:34,650
IT IS BEING USED BUT IT IS 

2193
01:12:34,650 --> 01:12:36,051
BEING USED IN THE RIGHT WAY AND 

2194
01:12:36,051 --> 01:12:38,053
IT IS FUNNY BECAUSE I WAS GOING 

2195
01:12:38,053 --> 01:12:44,793
TO ASK THE QUESTION. 

2196
01:12:44,793 --> 01:12:46,028
I SEARCHED A TOWN IN FLORIDA 

2197
01:12:46,028 --> 01:12:47,429
AND I STARTED GETTING ADS FOR A 

2198
01:12:47,429 --> 01:12:48,897
BRAND OF HOTEL THAT I STOOD -- 

2199
01:12:48,897 --> 01:12:55,370
THAT I TYPICALLY STAY IN THAT I 

2200
01:12:55,370 --> 01:12:56,572
WAS WILLING TO PAY AND STAY 

2201
01:12:56,572 --> 01:12:57,806
THERE SO I THOUGHT IT WAS 

2202
01:12:57,806 --> 01:12:58,607
ACTUALLY CONVENIENT INSTEAD OF 

2203
01:12:58,607 --> 01:13:00,576
GETTING AN ADD TO A PLACE I 

2204
01:13:00,576 --> 01:13:06,949
NEVER GO, I GOT AN ADD TO A 

2205
01:13:06,949 --> 01:13:08,550
PLACE I WAS LOOKING TO GO AND I 

2206
01:13:08,550 --> 01:13:09,384
THOUGHT THAT WAS CONVENIENT. 

2207
01:13:09,384 --> 01:13:10,385
AND IT WAS ON FACEBOOK. 

2208
01:13:10,385 --> 01:13:11,620
I USED FACEBOOK TO MESSAGE MY 

2209
01:13:11,620 --> 01:13:12,220
MOTHER-IN-LAW THIS WEEKEND. 

2210
01:13:12,220 --> 01:13:13,655
IT IS VERY VALUABLE AND YOU GET 

2211
01:13:13,655 --> 01:13:14,656
TO DO THAT FOR FREE. 

2212
01:13:14,656 --> 01:13:17,493
YOUR BUSINESS MODEL RELIES ON 

2213
01:13:17,493 --> 01:13:17,693
DATA. 

2214
01:13:17,693 --> 01:13:18,727
BUT THEY USE CONSUMER DRIVEN 

2215
01:13:18,727 --> 01:13:18,927
DATA. 

2216
01:13:18,927 --> 01:13:28,270
YOU ARE YOU -- NOT UNIQUE IN 

2217
01:13:28,270 --> 01:13:29,470
DOING THIS TYPE OF TARGETED 

2218
01:13:29,470 --> 01:13:29,837
ADS, ARE YOU? 

2219
01:13:29,837 --> 01:13:31,172
>> NO, CONGRESSMAN, YOU ARE 

2220
01:13:31,172 --> 01:13:32,107
RIGHT. 

2221
01:13:32,107 --> 01:13:33,342
ADD BASED BUSINESS MODELS ARE A 

2222
01:13:33,342 --> 01:13:34,376
COMMON WAY THAT PEOPLE HAVE 

2223
01:13:34,376 --> 01:13:35,377
BEEN ABLE TO OFFER FREE 

2224
01:13:35,377 --> 01:13:38,614
SERVICES FOR A LONG TIME AND 

2225
01:13:38,614 --> 01:13:39,848
OUR SOCIAL MISSION OF TRYING TO 

2226
01:13:39,848 --> 01:13:41,282
HELP CONNECT EVERYONE IN THE 

2227
01:13:41,282 --> 01:13:46,355
WORLD RELIES ON HAVING A 

2228
01:13:46,355 --> 01:13:47,355
SERVICE THAT CAN BE AFFORDABLE 

2229
01:13:47,355 --> 01:13:48,390
TO EVERYONE AND THAT EVERYONE 

2230
01:13:48,390 --> 01:13:50,125
CAN USE AND THAT'S WHY THE 

2231
01:13:50,125 --> 01:13:52,661
BUSINESS MODELS ARE THE SERVICE 

2232
01:13:52,661 --> 01:13:54,062
MISSION THAT WE HAD AND I THINK 

2233
01:13:54,062 --> 01:13:54,930
SOMETIMES, THAT GETS LOST. 

2234
01:13:54,930 --> 01:13:56,331
BUT THAT IS A REALLY IMPORTANT 

2235
01:13:56,331 --> 01:13:57,065
POINT.   

2236
01:13:57,065 --> 01:14:00,202
>>  BUT WHAT I AM WATCHING , 

2237
01:14:00,202 --> 01:14:01,737
THE HILLTOP ON BASKETBALL, THE 

2238
01:14:01,737 --> 01:14:05,641
PERSON ADVERTISING, I AM JUST 

2239
01:14:05,641 --> 01:14:07,075
WATCHING THE AD SO THERE IS NO 

2240
01:14:07,075 --> 01:14:08,277
DATA OR AGREEMENT OR RISK BUT 

2241
01:14:08,277 --> 01:14:12,346
WITH YOU, THERE IS CONSUMER 

2242
01:14:12,346 --> 01:14:12,748
DRIVEN DATA. 

2243
01:14:12,748 --> 01:14:13,949
BUT IF WE WERE TO GREATLY 

2244
01:14:13,949 --> 01:14:15,817
REDUCE OR STOP OR GREATLY 

2245
01:14:15,817 --> 01:14:16,618
REDUCED THROUGH LEGISLATION THE 

2246
01:14:16,618 --> 01:14:23,525
CONSUMER DRIVEN DATA FOR 

2247
01:14:23,525 --> 01:14:24,526
TARGETING ADS, WHAT DO YOU 

2248
01:14:24,526 --> 01:14:25,761
THINK THAT WOULD DO TO THE 

2249
01:14:25,761 --> 01:14:26,962
INTERNET -- I'M NOT SAYING THE 

2250
01:14:26,962 --> 01:14:27,629
INTERNET BUT EVERYTHING 

2251
01:14:27,629 --> 01:14:28,363
FACEBOOK?   

2252
01:14:28,363 --> 01:14:29,631
>>  CONGRESSMAN, IT WOULD MAKE 

2253
01:14:29,631 --> 01:14:39,775
THE ADS LESS RELEVANT .    

2254
01:14:39,775 --> 01:14:40,842
>>  WHAT WOULD THAT DO? 

2255
01:14:40,842 --> 01:14:42,210
>> IT WOULD HAVE A NUMBER OF 

2256
01:14:42,210 --> 01:14:42,477
EFFECTS. 

2257
01:14:42,477 --> 01:14:43,411
FOR THOSE USING THE SERVICES, 

2258
01:14:43,411 --> 01:14:44,646
IT WOULD MAKE THE ADS LESS 

2259
01:14:44,646 --> 01:14:45,247
RELEVANT TO THEM. 

2260
01:14:45,247 --> 01:14:46,281
FOR SMALL BUSINESSES WHO USE 

2261
01:14:46,281 --> 01:14:47,282
ADVERTISING,  IT WOULD MAKE 

2262
01:14:47,282 --> 01:14:47,882
ADVERTISING MORE EXPENSIVE 

2263
01:14:47,882 --> 01:14:49,117
BECAUSE THEY WOULD HAVE TO PAY 

2264
01:14:49,117 --> 01:14:50,319
MORE TO REACH MORE PEOPLE MORE 

2265
01:14:50,319 --> 01:14:50,953
EFFICIENTLY BECAUSE TARGETING 

2266
01:14:50,953 --> 01:14:59,661
HELPS SMALL BUSINESSES BE ABLE 

2267
01:14:59,661 --> 01:15:00,695
TO REACH PEOPLE AS EFFECTIVELY 

2268
01:15:00,695 --> 01:15:01,729
AS THE COMPANIES WHO TYPICALLY 

2269
01:15:01,729 --> 01:15:03,165
HAVE HAD THE ABILITY TO DO FOR 

2270
01:15:03,165 --> 01:15:03,765
A LONG TIME. 

2271
01:15:03,765 --> 01:15:04,800
IT WOULD AFFECT OUR REVENUE, 

2272
01:15:04,800 --> 01:15:05,400
SOMEWHAT, AS WELL. 

2273
01:15:05,400 --> 01:15:06,835
AND I THINK THERE ARE A COUPLE 

2274
01:15:06,835 --> 01:15:09,838
OF POINTS THAT ARE LOST. 

2275
01:15:09,838 --> 01:15:11,239
ONE IS THAT WE GIVE PEOPLE THE 

2276
01:15:11,239 --> 01:15:12,674
CONTROL TO NOT USE THE DATA AS 

2277
01:15:12,674 --> 01:15:13,275
IF THEY WANT. 

2278
01:15:13,275 --> 01:15:14,309
MOST PEOPLE DON'T DO THAT. 

2279
01:15:14,309 --> 01:15:15,944
I THINK PART OF THE REASON FOR 

2280
01:15:15,944 --> 01:15:17,145
THAT IS THAT PEOPLE GET THAT 

2281
01:15:17,145 --> 01:15:18,547
THEY ARE GOING TO SEE ADS, THEY 

2282
01:15:18,547 --> 01:15:19,581
WANT THEM TO BE RELEVANT. 

2283
01:15:19,581 --> 01:15:21,016
BUT THE OTHER THING IS THAT A 

2284
01:15:21,016 --> 01:15:22,217
LOT OF WHAT OUR BUSINESS, WHAT 

2285
01:15:22,217 --> 01:15:26,288
MAKES THE ADS WORK OR WHAT 

2286
01:15:26,288 --> 01:15:27,522
MAKES THE BUSINESS GOOD IS THAT 

2287
01:15:27,522 --> 01:15:28,523
PEOPLE ARE VERY ENGAGED WITH 

2288
01:15:28,523 --> 01:15:28,790
FACEBOOK. 

2289
01:15:28,790 --> 01:15:30,125
WE HAVE MORE THAN 1 BILLION OF 

2290
01:15:30,125 --> 01:15:31,360
PEOPLE WHO SPEND ALMOST AN HOUR 

2291
01:15:31,360 --> 01:15:33,828
A DAY ON OUR SERVICES. 

2292
01:15:33,828 --> 01:15:39,935
>> I APPRECIATE THAT. 

2293
01:15:39,935 --> 01:15:41,136
THIS JUST DOESN'T WORK FOR ME 

2294
01:15:41,136 --> 01:15:44,373
SO I WANTED TO LET THE 

2295
01:15:44,373 --> 01:15:45,374
CONGRESSMAN KNOW, YOU CAN HIT 

2296
01:15:45,374 --> 01:15:45,774
DELETE. 

2297
01:15:45,774 --> 01:15:53,115
WHAT HAPPENS WHEN I SAY, 

2298
01:15:53,115 --> 01:15:54,316
FACEBOOK, TAKE MY DATA OFF YOUR 

2299
01:15:54,316 --> 01:15:54,583
PLATFORM? 

2300
01:15:54,583 --> 01:15:56,551
>> IF YOU DELETE YOUR ACCOUNT, 

2301
01:15:56,551 --> 01:15:57,753
WE IMMEDIATELY MAKE IT SO THAT 

2302
01:15:57,753 --> 01:15:59,254
YOUR ACCOUNT IS NO LONGER 

2303
01:15:59,254 --> 01:16:01,823
AVAILABLE ONCE YOU ARE DONE 

2304
01:16:01,823 --> 01:16:03,258
DELETING IT SO THAT NO ONE CAN 

2305
01:16:03,258 --> 01:16:04,259
FIND YOU ON THE SERVICE. 

2306
01:16:04,259 --> 01:16:10,999
WE WOULD BE ABLE -- WE WOULD 

2307
01:16:10,999 --> 01:16:12,234
NOT BE ABLE TO RE-CREATE YOUR 

2308
01:16:12,234 --> 01:16:12,834
ACCOUNTS FROM THAT. 

2309
01:16:12,834 --> 01:16:14,036
WE DO HAVE DATA SYSTEMS THAT 

2310
01:16:14,036 --> 01:16:15,237
ARE REDUNDANT AND WE DO HAVE 

2311
01:16:15,237 --> 01:16:16,271
BACKUPS IN CASE SOMETHING BAD 

2312
01:16:16,271 --> 01:16:17,905
HAPPENS AND OVER A NUMBER OF 

2313
01:16:17,905 --> 01:16:19,307
DAYS, WE WILL GO THROUGH AND 

2314
01:16:19,307 --> 01:16:20,809
MAKE SURE TO FLUSH ALL OF THE 

2315
01:16:20,809 --> 01:16:22,177
CONTENT OUT OF THE SYSTEM BUT 

2316
01:16:22,177 --> 01:16:23,945
AS SOON AS YOU DELETE YOUR 

2317
01:16:23,945 --> 01:16:25,814
ACCOUNT, EFFECTIVELY, THAT 

2318
01:16:25,814 --> 01:16:26,848
CONTENT IS DISMANTLED AND WE 

2319
01:16:26,848 --> 01:16:31,119
WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO PUT YOUR 

2320
01:16:31,119 --> 01:16:31,686
ACCOUNTS BACK TOGETHER. 

2321
01:16:31,686 --> 01:16:33,088
>> WE RECOGNIZE A GENTLEMAN 

2322
01:16:33,088 --> 01:16:33,588
FROM MARYLAND. 

2323
01:16:33,588 --> 01:16:38,026
>> THANK YOU, MR. CHAIRMAN. 

2324
01:16:38,026 --> 01:16:38,827
GOOD MORNING, MR. ZUCKERBERG. 

2325
01:16:38,827 --> 01:16:40,796
I WANT TO GET SOMETHING ON THE 

2326
01:16:40,796 --> 01:16:41,496
RECORD QUICKLY. 

2327
01:16:41,496 --> 01:16:42,531
YOU SUGGESTED IN YOUR TESTIMONY 

2328
01:16:42,531 --> 01:16:45,967
THE LAST COUPLE OF DAYS THAT 

2329
01:16:45,967 --> 01:16:47,002
FACEBOOK NOTIFIED TRUMP AND THE 

2330
01:16:47,002 --> 01:16:47,636
CLINTON CAMPAIGN'S OPPRESSION 

2331
01:16:47,636 --> 01:16:49,137
ATTEMPTS TO HACK INTO THOSE 

2332
01:16:49,137 --> 01:16:53,709
CAMPAIGNS BUT REPRESENTATIVES 

2333
01:16:53,709 --> 01:16:55,444
OF BOTH CAMPAIGNS OVER THE LAST 

2334
01:16:55,444 --> 01:16:57,913
24 HOURS SAY THAT DIDN'T HAPPEN 

2335
01:16:57,913 --> 01:16:59,347
SO WE ARE GOING TO NEED TO 

2336
01:16:59,347 --> 01:17:01,983
FOLLOW UP ON THAT. 

2337
01:17:01,983 --> 01:17:03,218
I WOULD LIKE TO MOVE ON. 

2338
01:17:03,218 --> 01:17:04,419
YOU CAN PROVIDE A RESPONSE TO 

2339
01:17:04,419 --> 01:17:08,690
THAT IN WRITING, IF YOU WOULD. 

2340
01:17:08,690 --> 01:17:10,325
LET ME ASK YOU, IS IT TRUE THAT 

2341
01:17:10,325 --> 01:17:12,961
FACEBOOK OFFERED TO PROVIDE TO 

2342
01:17:12,961 --> 01:17:15,430
DEDICATED CAMPAIGN EMBEDS TO 

2343
01:17:15,430 --> 01:17:21,003
BOTH THE PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGNS?

2344
01:17:21,003 --> 01:17:22,871
>>  CONGRESSMAN, I CAN QUICKLY 

2345
01:17:22,871 --> 01:17:24,172
RESPOND . 

2346
01:17:24,172 --> 01:17:24,940
>> YES OR NO? 

2347
01:17:24,940 --> 01:17:27,976
I NEED TO GET TO THAT. 

2348
01:17:27,976 --> 01:17:29,211
WERE THERE EMBEDS IN THE TWO 

2349
01:17:29,211 --> 01:17:30,378
CAMPAIGNS OR OFFERS?   

2350
01:17:30,378 --> 01:17:34,148

EMBEDS AND I GATHER FROM MR. 

2355
01:17:51,366 --> 01:17:51,966
TRUMP CAMPAIGN ULTIMATELY

ACCEPTED THAT OFFER, IS THAT 

2357
01:17:53,001 --> 01:17:53,268
CORRECT?

01:17:53,268 --> 01:17:54,369
YES OR NO?   

2359
01:17:54,369 --> 01:17:55,604
>>  THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN HAD 

2360
01:17:55,604 --> 01:18:01,309
SALES  SUPPORT.    

2361
01:18:01,309 --> 01:18:02,511
>>  I WILL REFER TO THOSE AS 

2362
01:18:02,511 --> 01:18:02,744
EMBEDS. 

2363
01:18:02,744 --> 01:18:04,346
WHAT I WOULD LIKE YOU TO DO IF 

2364
01:18:04,346 --> 01:18:05,781
I COULD -- WE WON'T HAVE TIME 

2365
01:18:05,781 --> 01:18:07,415
TO DO THIS NOW  BUT IF YOU 

2366
01:18:07,415 --> 01:18:08,416
COULD PROVIDE TO THE COMMITTEE 

2367
01:18:08,416 --> 01:18:09,417
BOTH THE INITIAL OFFER TERMS 

2368
01:18:09,417 --> 01:18:10,452
AND ANY SUBSEQUENT OFFER TERMS 

2369
01:18:10,452 --> 01:18:11,920
THAT WERE PRESENTED TO EACH 

2370
01:18:11,920 --> 01:18:14,523
CANDIDATE IN TERMS OF WHAT THE 

2371
01:18:14,523 --> 01:18:15,724
EMBED SERVICES WOULD BE, THAT 

2372
01:18:15,724 --> 01:18:19,995
WOULD BE VERY HELPFUL. 

2373
01:18:19,995 --> 01:18:21,429
DO YOU KNOW HOW MANY ADS WERE 

2374
01:18:21,429 --> 01:18:22,264
APPROVED FOR DISPLAY ON 

2375
01:18:22,264 --> 01:18:23,799
FACEBOOK FOR EACH OF THE 

2376
01:18:23,799 --> 01:18:31,139
PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES BY 

2377
01:18:31,139 --> 01:18:31,406
FACEBOOK? 

2378
01:18:31,406 --> 01:18:32,174
>> CONGRESSMAN, I DO NOT. 

2379
01:18:32,174 --> 01:18:33,608
SITTING HERE AT THE TOP OF MY 

2380
01:18:33,608 --> 01:18:33,875
HEAD -- 

2381
01:18:33,875 --> 01:18:35,443
>> -- LET ME TELL YOU BECAUSE I 

2382
01:18:35,443 --> 01:18:35,643
DO. 

2383
01:18:35,643 --> 01:18:37,179
TRUMP CAMPAIGN AN ESTIMATE OF 

2384
01:18:37,179 --> 01:18:39,281
FIVE POINT 9 MILLION ADS, 

2385
01:18:39,281 --> 01:18:42,317
SECRETARY CLINTON, 66,000 ADS, 

2386
01:18:42,317 --> 01:18:43,952
THAT IS 90 TIMES AS MUCH ON THE 

2387
01:18:43,952 --> 01:18:45,320
TRUMP CAMPAIGN WHICH RAISES 

2388
01:18:45,320 --> 01:18:47,823
SOME QUESTIONS ABOUT WHETHER 

2389
01:18:47,823 --> 01:18:49,591
THE AD APPROVAL PROCESSES WERE 

2390
01:18:49,591 --> 01:18:52,694
MAYBE NOT PROCESSED CORRECTLY 

2391
01:18:52,694 --> 01:18:56,198
OR INAPPROPRIATELY BYPASSED IN 

2392
01:18:56,198 --> 01:19:02,237
THE FINAL WEEKS OF THE TRUMP 

2393
01:19:02,237 --> 01:19:03,271
CAMPAIGN AND WHAT I'M WONDERING 

2394
01:19:03,271 --> 01:19:04,472
ABOUT IS IF THE EMBEDS HELPED 

2395
01:19:04,472 --> 01:19:10,378
TO FACILITATE THAT. CAN YOU SAY 

2396
01:19:10,378 --> 01:19:11,179
WITH ABSOLUTE CERTAINTY THAT 

2397
01:19:11,179 --> 01:19:12,414
FACEBOOK OR ANY OF THE FACEBOOK 

2398
01:19:12,414 --> 01:19:14,750
EMPLOYEES WORKING AS CAMPAIGNING

2399
01:19:14,750 --> 01:19:15,851
DID NOT GRANT APPROVAL RIGHTS 

2400
01:19:15,851 --> 01:19:17,085
TO THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN TO ALLOW 

2401
01:19:17,085 --> 01:19:18,286
THEM TO UPLOAD A VERY LARGE 

2402
01:19:18,286 --> 01:19:20,088
NUMBER OF FACEBOOK ADS IN THAT 

2403
01:19:20,088 --> 01:19:23,391
FINAL STRETCH?    

2404
01:19:23,391 --> 01:19:24,593
>>  CONGRESSMAN, WE APPLY THE 

2405
01:19:24,593 --> 01:19:27,462
SAME STANDARDS TO ALL  

2406
01:19:27,462 --> 01:19:27,762
CAMPAIGNS. 

2407
01:19:27,762 --> 01:19:28,897
>> CAN YOU SAY THEY WERE NOT 

2408
01:19:28,897 --> 01:19:34,236
SPECIAL APPROVAL RIGHTS GRANTED?

2409
01:19:34,236 --> 01:19:35,170
WERE NOT SPECIAL APPROVAL 

2410
01:19:35,170 --> 01:19:36,371
RIGHTS GRANTED BY ANY OF THE 

2411
01:19:36,371 --> 01:19:37,572
EMBEDS OR SUPPORT FOLKS, AS YOU 

2412
01:19:37,572 --> 01:19:39,074
CALL THEM IN THAT TRUMP 

2413
01:19:39,074 --> 01:19:40,442
CAMPAIGN?    

2414
01:19:40,442 --> 01:19:45,714
>>  YES, WHAT I AM SAYING  -- 

2415
01:19:45,714 --> 01:19:46,948
SUSPECT IF YOU ARE SAYING YES, 

2416
01:19:46,948 --> 01:19:48,350
I WILL TAKE YOU AT YOUR WORD. 

2417
01:19:48,350 --> 01:19:52,220
THE REASON THIS IS IMPORTANT 

2418
01:19:52,220 --> 01:19:53,855
AND THAT WE NEED TO GET TO THE 

2419
01:19:53,855 --> 01:19:55,056
BOTTOM OF IT IS BECAUSE IT 

2420
01:19:55,056 --> 01:19:56,291
COULD BE A SERIOUS PROBLEM IF 

2421
01:19:56,291 --> 01:19:59,961
THESE SERVICES WERE PROVIDED 

2422
01:19:59,961 --> 01:20:01,396
BECAUSE THAT COULD RESULT IN 

2423
01:20:01,396 --> 01:20:08,103
FINANCIAL CAMPAIGN -- LAW. 

2424
01:20:08,103 --> 01:20:08,703
CORPORATE CONTRIBUTION FROM 

2425
01:20:08,703 --> 01:20:18,647
FACEBOOK BEYOND THE OPPORTUNITY 

2426
01:20:18,647 --> 01:20:19,247
WOULD TYPICALLY PROVIDE. 

2427
01:20:19,247 --> 01:20:20,448
THE REASON I AM ASKING THESE 

2428
01:20:20,448 --> 01:20:21,683
QUESTIONS IS THAT I AM WORRIED 

2429
01:20:21,683 --> 01:20:22,884
THAT THE EMBED PROGRAM HAS THE 

2430
01:20:22,884 --> 01:20:24,119
POTENTIAL TO BECOME A TOOL FOR 

2431
01:20:24,119 --> 01:20:25,220
FACEBOOK TO SOLICIT FAVOR FROM 

2432
01:20:25,220 --> 01:20:25,954
POLICYMAKERS AND THAT CREATES 

2433
01:20:25,954 --> 01:20:32,627
THE POTENTIAL FOR REAL CONFLICT 

2434
01:20:32,627 --> 01:20:33,061
OF INTEREST. 

2435
01:20:33,061 --> 01:20:34,462
AND I THINK A LOT OF AMERICANS 

2436
01:20:34,462 --> 01:20:35,931
ARE WAKING UP TO THE FACT THAT 

2437
01:20:35,931 --> 01:20:37,132
FACEBOOK IS BECOMING SORT OF A 

2438
01:20:37,132 --> 01:20:37,832
SELF REGULATED SUPERSTRUCTURE 

2439
01:20:37,832 --> 01:20:43,805
FOR POLITICAL DISCOURSE. 

2440
01:20:43,805 --> 01:20:45,040
AND THE QUESTION IS, ARE WE, 

2441
01:20:45,040 --> 01:20:46,040
THE PEOPLE, GOING TO REGULATE 

2442
01:20:46,040 --> 01:20:47,075
OUR POLITICAL DIALOGUE OR ARE 

2443
01:20:47,075 --> 01:20:47,675
YOU, MARK ZUCKERBERG, 

2444
01:20:47,675 --> 01:20:49,911
REGULATING THE POLITICAL -- SO 

2445
01:20:49,911 --> 01:20:51,880
WE NEED TO BE FREE OF THAT 

2446
01:20:51,880 --> 01:20:57,619
UNDUE INFLUENCE.    

2447
01:20:57,619 --> 01:20:58,853
>>  THE CHAIR RECOGNIZES THE 

2448
01:20:58,853 --> 01:20:59,654
GENTLEMAN FROM TEXAS, MR. 

2449
01:20:59,654 --> 01:20:59,887
OLSON. 

2450
01:20:59,887 --> 01:21:01,089
>> DO YOU MIND FOR THE RECORD 

2451
01:21:01,089 --> 01:21:03,023
IF I JUST ANSWER  THE FIRST 

2452
01:21:03,023 --> 01:21:06,161
POINT. IT WILL TAKE 10 SECONDS. 

2453
01:21:06,161 --> 01:21:07,362
WHEN I WAS REFERRING TO THE 

2454
01:21:07,362 --> 01:21:09,263
CAMPAIGN, I MET THE DNC AND THE 

2455
01:21:09,263 --> 01:21:09,664
RNC. 

2456
01:21:09,664 --> 01:21:10,465
I MAY HAVE MISSPOKEN. 

2457
01:21:10,465 --> 01:21:11,466
THAT IS TECHNICALLY CALLED THE 

2458
01:21:11,466 --> 01:21:12,500
COMMITTEES BUT THOSE OF THE 

2459
01:21:12,500 --> 01:21:13,368
FOLKS I WAS REFERRING TO. 

2460
01:21:13,368 --> 01:21:14,502
>> THANKS FOR THAT 

2461
01:21:14,502 --> 01:21:14,869
CLARIFICATION. 

2462
01:21:14,869 --> 01:21:21,309
WE NOW GO TO MR. OLSON. 

2463
01:21:21,309 --> 01:21:22,610
>> I THINK THE CHAIR AND MR. 

2464
01:21:22,610 --> 01:21:24,379
ZUCKERBERG, I KNOW WE BOTH WISH 

2465
01:21:24,379 --> 01:21:26,681
WE WERE MEETING UNDER DIFFERENT 

2466
01:21:26,681 --> 01:21:27,048
CIRCUMSTANCES. 

2467
01:21:27,048 --> 01:21:35,423
THE STORY BROKE WITH CORDIS 

2468
01:21:35,423 --> 01:21:36,524
SAYING, I STARTED FACEBOOK. 

2469
01:21:36,524 --> 01:21:36,824
I RUN IT. 

2470
01:21:36,824 --> 01:21:38,393
I AM RESPONSIBLE FOR WHAT 

2471
01:21:38,393 --> 01:21:44,199
HAPPENS HERE.

2472
01:21:44,199 --> 01:21:45,600
". HE SAID THE SAME WORDS IN 

2473
01:21:45,600 --> 01:21:46,601
YOUR OPENING STATEMENT AN HOUR 

2474
01:21:46,601 --> 01:21:47,235
AND HALF AGO. 

2475
01:21:47,235 --> 01:21:48,636
I KNOW YOU BELIEVE THAT IN YOUR 

2476
01:21:48,636 --> 01:21:48,870
HEART. 

2477
01:21:48,870 --> 01:21:50,038
IT IS NOT JUST SOME TALKING 

2478
01:21:50,038 --> 01:21:50,839
POINTS OR CANNED SPEECH. 

2479
01:21:50,839 --> 01:21:57,145
NINE YEARS IN THE NAVY, I KNOW 

2480
01:21:57,145 --> 01:21:58,146
THE BEST OFFICERS, THE BEST 

2481
01:21:58,146 --> 01:21:59,381
SKIPPERS AND THE BEST CEOS HAVE 

2482
01:21:59,381 --> 01:22:00,382
THAT EXACT SAME ATTITUDE. 

2483
01:22:05,053 --> 01:22:07,055
IF FACEBOOK WAS A NAVY SHIP, 

2484
01:22:07,055 --> 01:22:12,594
YOUR PRIVACY HAS TAKEN A DIRECT 

2485
01:22:12,594 --> 01:22:12,794
HIT. 

2486
01:22:12,794 --> 01:22:13,995
YOU ARE TAKING ON WATER AND 

2487
01:22:13,995 --> 01:22:20,234
YOUR FUTURE MAY BE DEFINED. 

2488
01:22:20,234 --> 01:22:21,136
TODAY, OVER $1 BILLION IN FINES 

2489
01:22:21,136 --> 01:22:23,938
ARE COMING YOUR WAY. 

2490
01:22:23,938 --> 01:22:25,173
AS YOU KNOW, YOU HAVE TO 

2491
01:22:25,173 --> 01:22:25,974
REINFORCE YOUR WORDS WITH 

2492
01:22:25,974 --> 01:22:26,241
ACTIONS. 

2493
01:22:26,241 --> 01:22:31,879
A FEW QUESTIONS HAVE HAPPENED 

2494
01:22:31,879 --> 01:22:32,480
IN THE PAST. 

2495
01:22:32,480 --> 01:22:34,716
FIRST OF ALL, BACK IN 2012, 

2496
01:22:34,716 --> 01:22:40,021
FACEBOOK DID AN EXPERIMENT ON 

2497
01:22:40,021 --> 01:22:47,729
609,003 FACEBOOK USERS. 

2498
01:22:47,729 --> 01:22:48,763
YOU REDUCED POSITIVE POSTS FROM 

2499
01:22:48,763 --> 01:22:49,630
USES FRIENDS AND LIMITED SO-

2500
01:22:49,630 --> 01:22:51,065
CALLED DATA POSTS FROM OTHER 

2501
01:22:51,065 --> 01:22:51,432
FRIENDS. 

2502
01:22:51,432 --> 01:22:52,433
ONE GROUP SOUGHT IS POSITIVE 

2503
01:22:52,433 --> 01:22:54,669
AND THE OTHER GROUP, NEGATIVE. 

2504
01:22:54,669 --> 01:22:57,072
THE GOAL WAS TO SEE HOW THIS 

2505
01:22:57,072 --> 01:23:00,508
WOULD AFFECT BEHAVIOR. 

2506
01:23:00,508 --> 01:23:02,143
I WAS GIVEN A SPORTS ARTICLE 

2507
01:23:02,143 --> 01:23:06,214
FOR THE LA TIMES. I WANT TO 

2508
01:23:06,214 --> 01:23:12,087
TALK ABOUT THAT. 

2509
01:23:12,087 --> 01:23:13,121
THIS IS DISSECTING PEOPLE IN 

2510
01:23:13,121 --> 01:23:14,489
STARK CONTRAST TO CONNECTING 

2511
01:23:14,489 --> 01:23:16,157
PEOPLE. EXPLAIN HOW YOU THOUGHT 

2512
01:23:16,157 --> 01:23:18,393
THIS IDEA WAS A GOOD IDEA? 

2513
01:23:18,393 --> 01:23:29,170
EXPLAIN WITH PEOPLE.    

2514
01:23:29,170 --> 01:23:30,638
>>  I DO HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY 

2515
01:23:30,638 --> 01:23:31,606
OF NOT JUST BUILDING SERVICES 

2516
01:23:31,606 --> 01:23:32,807
THAT PEOPLE LIKE TO USE BUT 

2517
01:23:32,807 --> 01:23:34,409
MAKING SURE THOSE SERVICES ARE 

2518
01:23:34,409 --> 01:23:36,077
ALSO  GOOD FOR PEOPLE AND GOOD 

2519
01:23:36,077 --> 01:23:36,478
FOR SOCIETY. 

2520
01:23:36,478 --> 01:23:37,679
AT THE TIME, THERE WERE A 

2521
01:23:37,679 --> 01:23:38,513
NUMBER OF QUESTIONS ABOUT 

2522
01:23:38,513 --> 01:23:39,314
WHETHER PEOPLE SEEING CONTENT 

2523
01:23:39,314 --> 01:23:40,315
THAT WAS EITHER POSITIVE OR 

2524
01:23:40,315 --> 01:23:41,349
NEGATIVE ON SOCIAL NETWORKS WAS 

2525
01:23:41,349 --> 01:23:47,422
AFFECTING THEIR MOOD. AND WE 

2526
01:23:47,422 --> 01:23:48,456
FELT LIKE WE HAD A 

2527
01:23:48,456 --> 01:23:49,090
RESPONSIBILITY TO UNDERSTAND 

2528
01:23:49,090 --> 01:23:50,525
WHETHER THAT WAS THE CASE 

2529
01:23:50,525 --> 01:23:53,728
BECAUSE WE DON'T WANT TO HAVE 

2530
01:23:53,728 --> 01:23:54,129
THAT EFFECT. 

2531
01:23:54,129 --> 01:24:01,269
WE WANT USE OF SOCIAL MEDIA AND 

2532
01:24:01,269 --> 01:24:02,470
OUR PRODUCTS TO BE GOOD FOR 

2533
01:24:02,470 --> 01:24:02,937
PEOPLE'S WELL-BEING. 

2534
01:24:02,937 --> 01:24:04,072
WE CONTINUE TO MAKE CHANGES TO 

2535
01:24:04,072 --> 01:24:04,506
THAT EFFECT. 

2536
01:24:04,506 --> 01:24:05,306
INCLUDING RECENTLY, THIS YEAR. 

2537
01:24:05,306 --> 01:24:06,541
WE DID A NUMBER OF RESEARCH 

2538
01:24:06,541 --> 01:24:19,320
PROJECTS THAT SHOWED THAT WHEN 

2539
01:24:19,320 --> 01:24:20,355
SOCIAL MEDIA IS USED FOR 

2540
01:24:20,355 --> 01:24:20,989
BUILDING RELATIONSHIPS, WHEN 

2541
01:24:20,989 --> 01:24:21,756
YOU ARE INTERACTING WITH 

2542
01:24:21,756 --> 01:24:22,790
PEOPLE, AND IS ASSOCIATED WITH 

2543
01:24:22,790 --> 01:24:23,992
A LOT OF POSITIVE EFFECTS OF 

2544
01:24:23,992 --> 01:24:24,826
WELL-BEING THAT YOU WOULD 

2545
01:24:24,826 --> 01:24:26,027
EXPECT AND IT MAKES YOU FEEL 

2546
01:24:26,027 --> 01:24:26,861
LESS CONNECTED SOCIAL MORE

CONSUME COMPETENCE, THAT 

2551
01:24:38,439 --> 01:24:39,440
DOESN'T HAVE THE SAME POSITIVE 

2552
01:24:39,440 --> 01:24:40,441
EFFECTS AND CAN EVEN BE 

2553
01:24:40,441 --> 01:24:40,708
NEGATIVE.

OF THAT AND THAT IS AN EXAMPLE 

2557

OF THE KIND OF WORK THAT WE DO.

THOUSANDS ARE THERE WILL BE.

DEDICATED TO SECURITY

DEDICATED TO THESE CAUSES, HOW 

2578
01:25:22,283 --> 01:25:22,850

ALEXANDER: -- ALEKSANDR KOGAN --

2582

THE SHEER CONTENT ON FACEBOOK 

2583
01:25:34,495 --> 01:25:35,930
MAKES IT SO THAT NO AMOUNT OF 

2584
01:25:35,930 --> 01:25:47,075
PEOPLE YOU CAN HIRE WILL BE 

2585
01:25:47,075 --> 01:25:48,309
ENOUGH TO REVIEW ALL OF THE 

2586
01:25:48,309 --> 01:25:48,576
CONTENT. 

2587
01:25:48,576 --> 01:25:49,911
WE NEED TO RELY ON AND BUILD 

2588
01:25:49,911 --> 01:25:50,945
SOPHISTICATED AI TOOLS THAT CAN 

2589
01:25:50,945 --> 01:25:51,946
HELP US FLAG CERTAIN CONTENT 

2590
01:25:51,946 --> 01:25:53,181
AND WE ARE GETTING GOOD IN 

2591
01:25:53,181 --> 01:25:53,581
CERTAIN AREAS. 

2592
01:25:53,581 --> 01:25:54,816
ONE OF THE AREAS I MENTIONED 

2593
01:25:54,816 --> 01:25:55,617
EARLIER WAS TERRORIST CONTENT 

2594
01:25:55,617 --> 01:25:56,818
WHERE WE NOW HAVE SYSTEMS THAT 

2595
01:25:56,818 --> 01:25:58,052
CAN IDENTIFY AND TAKE DOWN 99% 

2596
01:25:58,052 --> 01:26:01,189

SOMEONE EVEN FLACCID. 

2599
01:26:02,924 --> 01:26:04,958
I THINK WE NEED TO DO MORE OF 

2600
01:26:04,958 --> 01:26:06,160
THAT.

2607
01:26:17,438 --> 01:26:18,773

2608
01:26:18,773 --> 01:26:19,574
GRUELING PROCESS AND I 

2609
01:26:19,574 --> 01:26:20,208
APPRECIATE YOUR COOPERATION.

ALGORITHMS. 

2614
01:26:30,952 --> 01:26:31,953
MANY OF MY CONSTITUENTS ARE 

2615
01:26:31,953 --> 01:26:32,587
AFFECTED BY THESE. 

2616
01:26:32,587 --> 01:26:33,788
I AM DEEPLY COMMITTED AND I 

2617
01:26:33,788 --> 01:26:35,023

QUESTION. 

2619
01:26:35,290 --> 01:26:37,458
IS THERE A CURRENT PLACE I CAN 

2620
01:26:37,458 --> 01:26:38,493
DOWNLOAD ALL OF THE FACEBOOK 

2621
01:26:38,493 --> 01:26:39,294

WEBSITES THAT I HAVE VISITED?   

2623
01:26:40,828 --> 01:26:41,962
>>  YES, CONGRESSMAN.  

2624
01:26:41,962 --> 01:26:44,532
WE HAVE A "DOWNLOAD YOUR 

2625
01:26:44,532 --> 01:26:46,634

2626
01:26:46,634 --> 01:26:49,837
IT FOR YEARS.    

2627
01:26:49,837 --> 01:26:52,473
>>  MY STAFF  DOWNLOADED THEIR

2630
01:26:59,981 --> 01:27:01,015
YOU SAYING THAT FACEBOOK DOES 

2631
01:27:01,015 --> 01:27:04,152
NOT HAVE BROWSING HISTORY? 

2632
01:27:04,152 --> 01:27:05,286
>> CONGRESSMAN, THAT WOULD BE 

2633
01:27:05,286 --> 01:27:05,553
CORRECT. 

2634
01:27:05,553 --> 01:27:06,688
IF WE DON'T HAVE CONTENT IN 

2635
01:27:06,688 --> 01:27:07,722
THERE, THAT MEANS YOU DON'T 

2636
01:27:07,722 --> 01:27:12,626

IS THERE ANY OTHER INFORMATION 

2640
01:27:15,462 --> 01:27:16,497
THAT FACEBOOK HAS CONTAINED -- 

2641
01:27:16,497 --> 01:27:22,770
OBTAINED ABOUT ME THAT WOULD 

2642
01:27:22,770 --> 01:27:23,771
NOT BE INCLUDED IN THE

AFTERWORDS. 

2650
01:27:31,879 --> 01:27:32,714
MR. ZUCKERBERG, YOU INDICATED 

2651
01:27:32,714 --> 01:27:34,115
THAT THE EUROPEAN USERS WOULD 

2652
01:27:34,115 --> 01:27:40,221
HAVE GD RP PROTECTIONS AND 

2653
01:27:40,221 --> 01:27:41,222
AMERICANS WOULD HAVE NO SIMILAR 

2654
01:27:41,222 --> 01:27:41,555
PROTECTIONS. 

2655
01:27:41,555 --> 01:27:42,457
WHEN WITH THE AMERICAN USERS 

2656
01:27:42,457 --> 01:27:46,560
HAVE THOSE PROTECTIONS? 

2657
01:27:46,560 --> 01:27:47,929
>> WE ARE WORKING ON DOING THAT 

2658
01:27:47,929 --> 01:27:48,796
AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE. 

2659
01:27:48,796 --> 01:27:49,997
I DON'T HAVE THE EXACT DATE, 

2660
01:27:49,997 --> 01:27:50,197
YET. 

2661
01:27:50,197 --> 01:27:54,502
WE ARE WORKING ON IT. 

2662
01:27:54,502 --> 01:27:55,503
>> YOUR COMPANY AND MANY 

2663
01:27:55,503 --> 01:27:56,270
COMPANIES HAVE A STAGGERING 

2664
01:27:56,270 --> 01:27:58,706
AMOUNT OF PERSONAL INFORMATION. 

2665
01:27:58,706 --> 01:27:59,907
THE CUSTOMER IS NOT REALLY IN 

2666
01:27:59,907 --> 01:28:07,014
THE DRIVER SEAT ABOUT HOW THERE 

2667
01:28:07,014 --> 01:28:08,049
DATA IS USED OR MONETIZED. 

2668
01:28:08,049 --> 01:28:09,350
TODAY, MONITORED BY PRIVACY 

2669
01:28:09,350 --> 01:28:11,486
PROTECTIONS. 

2670
01:28:11,486 --> 01:28:12,319
I WILL INTRODUCE LEGISLATION 

2671
01:28:12,319 --> 01:28:24,932
THAT WILL HELP WITH THIS ISSUE. 

2672
01:28:24,932 --> 01:28:25,767
WITHOUT THIS KIND OF 

2673
01:28:25,767 --> 01:28:26,968
LEGISLATION, HOW CAN WE BE SURE 

2674
01:28:26,968 --> 01:28:28,002
THAT FACEBOOK WILL CONTINUE TO 

2675
01:28:28,002 --> 01:28:28,803
BE CARELESS WITH USERS 

2676
01:28:28,803 --> 01:28:29,504
INFORMATION?   

2677
01:28:29,504 --> 01:28:33,241
>>  CONGRESSMAN,  LET ME FIRST 

2678
01:28:33,241 --> 01:28:34,241
SET ASIDE THAT MY POSITION 

2679
01:28:34,241 --> 01:28:45,219
ISN'T THAT THERE SHOULD BE NO 

2680
01:28:45,219 --> 01:28:45,519
REGULATION. 

2681
01:28:45,519 --> 01:28:46,454
REGARDLESS OF THE LAWS IN 

2682
01:28:46,454 --> 01:28:47,655
PLACE, WE HAVE A VERY STRONG 

2683
01:28:47,655 --> 01:28:48,489
INCENTIVE TO PROTECT PEOPLE'S 

2684
01:28:48,489 --> 01:28:48,822
INFORMATION. 

2685
01:28:48,822 --> 01:28:49,891
THIS IS THE CORE THING THAT 

2686
01:28:49,891 --> 01:28:50,892
FACEBOOK IS, 100 BILLION TIMES 

2687
01:28:50,892 --> 01:28:52,126
A DAY, PEOPLE COME TO OUR 

2688
01:28:52,126 --> 01:28:53,528
SERVICE TO SHARE A PHOTO OR 

2689
01:28:53,528 --> 01:28:53,928
SHARE A MESSAGE. 

2690
01:28:53,928 --> 01:28:55,196
>> I HEAR YOU SAYING THIS BUT 

2691
01:28:55,196 --> 01:28:56,030
THE HISTORY ISN'T THERE. 

2692
01:28:56,030 --> 01:28:57,632
SO I THINK THAT WE NEED TO MAKE 

2693
01:28:57,632 --> 01:28:59,233
SURE THAT THERE ARE REGULATIONS 

2694
01:28:59,233 --> 01:29:01,702
IN PLACE TO GIVE YOU THE PROPER 

2695
01:29:01,702 --> 01:29:03,237
MOTIVATION TO STAY ONLINE WITH 

2696
01:29:03,237 --> 01:29:05,540
DATA PROTECTION. 

2697
01:29:05,540 --> 01:29:07,508
ONE OF THE PROBLEMS HERE IN MY 

2698
01:29:07,508 --> 01:29:13,647
MIND IS FACEBOOK'S HISTORY. 

2699
01:29:13,647 --> 01:29:14,682
THE USER PRIVACY AND SECURITY 

2700
01:29:14,682 --> 01:29:15,683
HAVE NOT BEEN GIVEN HIGH 

2701
01:29:15,683 --> 01:29:17,251
PRIORITY AND YOU HAVE ADMITTED 

2702
01:29:17,251 --> 01:29:18,719
AS MUCH. 

2703
01:29:18,719 --> 01:29:19,353
IS FACEBOOK CONSIDERING 

2704
01:29:19,353 --> 01:29:20,154
CHANGING ITS STRUCTURE TO 

2705
01:29:20,154 --> 01:29:25,727
ENSURE THAT PRIVACY AND SECURITY

2706
01:29:25,727 --> 01:29:26,661
HAVE SUFFICIENT PRIORITY TO 

2707
01:29:26,661 --> 01:29:27,662
PREVENT THESE PROBLEMS IN THE 

2708
01:29:27,662 --> 01:29:27,895
FUTURE? 

2709
01:29:27,895 --> 01:29:28,729
>> CONGRESSMAN, THIS IS AN 

2710
01:29:28,729 --> 01:29:37,739
INCREDIBLE HIGH PRIORITY FOR US.

2711
01:29:37,739 --> 01:29:39,040
PEOPLE COME AND TRY TO SHARE 

2712
01:29:39,040 --> 01:29:40,074
SOMETHING WITH A SPECIFIC SET 

2713
01:29:40,074 --> 01:29:40,475
OF PEOPLE. 

2714
01:29:40,475 --> 01:29:41,943
THAT WORKS BECAUSE PEOPLE HAVE 

2715
01:29:41,943 --> 01:29:43,311
CONFIDENCE THAT IF THEY SEND A 

2716
01:29:43,311 --> 01:29:44,745
MESSAGE, IT IS GOING TO GO TO 

2717
01:29:44,745 --> 01:29:48,783
THE PERSON THEY WANT. 

2718
01:29:48,783 --> 01:29:50,218
IF THEY WANT TO SHARE A PHOTO, 

2719
01:29:50,218 --> 01:29:51,452
IT GOES TO THE PEOPLE THEY 

2720
01:29:51,452 --> 01:29:51,652
WANT. 

2721
01:29:51,652 --> 01:29:52,453
THAT IS INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT. 

2722
01:29:52,453 --> 01:29:53,454
>> THAT'S A LITTLE OFF TRACK 

2723
01:29:53,454 --> 01:30:00,795
FROM WHAT I'M TRYING TO GET A. 

2724
01:30:00,795 --> 01:30:01,596
THE PRIVACY PROTECTIONS CLEARLY 

2725
01:30:01,596 --> 01:30:02,864
FAILED IN A COUPLE OF CASES 

2726
01:30:02,864 --> 01:30:03,664
THAT ARE HIGH-PROFILE, RIGHT 

2727
01:30:03,664 --> 01:30:03,864
NOW. 

2728
01:30:03,864 --> 01:30:05,066
AND PART OF THE BLAME THAT 

2729
01:30:05,066 --> 01:30:07,935
SEEMS TO BE OUT THERE IS THE 

2730
01:30:07,935 --> 01:30:08,535
MANAGEMENT STRUCTURE FOR 

2731
01:30:08,535 --> 01:30:15,810
PRIVACY AND SECURITY DON'T HAVE 

2732
01:30:15,810 --> 01:30:17,044
THE RIGHT LEVEL OF PROFILE AND 

2733
01:30:17,044 --> 01:30:18,045
FACEBOOK TO GET YOUR ATTENTION 

2734
01:30:18,045 --> 01:30:19,947
TO BE SURE THEY GET THE PROPER 

2735
01:30:19,947 --> 01:30:21,449
RESOURCES.

2736
01:30:21,449 --> 01:30:29,624
>> YOUR TIME HAS EXPIRED. 

2737
01:30:29,624 --> 01:30:30,424
THE CHAIR RECOGNIZES MR. 

2738
01:30:30,424 --> 01:30:30,657
KINLEY. 

2739
01:30:30,657 --> 01:30:31,024
>> THANK YOU. 

2740
01:30:31,024 --> 01:30:34,095
I'VE GOT A YES OR NO QUESTION. 

2741
01:30:34,095 --> 01:30:37,398
SHOULD FACEBOOK ENABLE ILLEGAL 

2742
01:30:37,398 --> 01:30:39,367
ONLINE PHARMACIES TO SELL DRUGS 

2743
01:30:39,367 --> 01:30:43,637
LIKE OXYCONTIN, PERCOCET, 

2744
01:30:43,637 --> 01:30:45,973
VICODIN, WITHOUT A PRESCRIPTION?

2745
01:30:45,973 --> 01:30:48,709
>>  CONGRESSMAN,  THAT IS 

2746
01:30:48,709 --> 01:30:50,578
AGAINST OUR POLICIES. 

2747
01:30:50,578 --> 01:30:52,113
OF COURSE NOT.

2748
01:30:52,113 --> 01:31:04,759
>> THERE ARE 35,000 ONLINE 

2749
01:31:04,759 --> 01:31:05,359
PHARMACIES OPERATING AND 

2750
01:31:05,359 --> 01:31:06,394
ACCORDING TO THE FDA, THEY 

2751
01:31:06,394 --> 01:31:07,828
THINK THERE MAY BE 96% OF THEM 

2752
01:31:07,828 --> 01:31:08,295
OPERATING ILLEGALLY. 

2753
01:31:08,295 --> 01:31:09,463
AND ON NOVEMBER OF LAST YEAR, 

2754
01:31:09,463 --> 01:31:10,698
CNBC HAD AN ARTICLE SAYING THAT 

2755
01:31:10,698 --> 01:31:15,570
YOU WERE SURPRISED BY THE 

2756
01:31:15,570 --> 01:31:16,537
BREATH OF THIS OPIOID CRISIS 

2757
01:31:16,537 --> 01:31:18,406
AND AS YOU CAN SEE FROM THESE 

2758
01:31:18,406 --> 01:31:20,041
PHOTOGRAPHS, OPIOIDS ARE STILL 

2759
01:31:20,041 --> 01:31:25,079
AVAILABLE ON YOUR SITE. 

2760
01:31:25,079 --> 01:31:26,080
THAT THEY ARE WITHOUT A 

2761
01:31:26,080 --> 01:31:34,822
PRESCRIPTION ON YOUR SITE. 

2762
01:31:34,822 --> 01:31:35,856
SO THAT CONTRADICTS WHAT YOU 

2763
01:31:35,856 --> 01:31:37,258
JUST SAID A MINUTE AGO AND IT 

2764
01:31:37,258 --> 01:31:38,492
WENT ON LAST WEEK, THE FDA 

2765
01:31:38,492 --> 01:31:41,529
COMMISSIONER, SCOTT GOTLAND, 

2766
01:31:41,529 --> 01:31:42,363
HAS TESTIFIED SAYING THE 

2767
01:31:42,363 --> 01:31:43,397
INTERNET FIRMS SIMPLY ARE NOT 

2768
01:31:43,397 --> 01:31:45,633
TAKING PRACTICAL STEPS TO FIND 

2769
01:31:45,633 --> 01:31:47,134
AND REMOVE THESE ILLEGAL OPIOID 

2770
01:31:47,134 --> 01:31:48,836
LISTINGS AND HE SPECIFICALLY 

2771
01:31:48,836 --> 01:31:51,072
MENTIONED FACEBOOK. ARE YOU 

2772
01:31:51,072 --> 01:32:02,249
AWARE OF THAT? 

2773
01:32:02,249 --> 01:32:02,650
HIS QUOTE? 

2774
01:32:02,650 --> 01:32:03,116
YES OR NO? 

2775
01:32:03,116 --> 01:32:04,485
>> I'M NOT AWARE OF HIS QUOTE 

2776
01:32:04,485 --> 01:32:05,720
BUT I HEARD THAT HE SAID 

2777
01:32:05,720 --> 01:32:06,954
SOMETHING AND LET ME JUST SPEAK 

2778
01:32:06,954 --> 01:32:08,422
TO THIS FOR A SECOND. 

2779
01:32:08,422 --> 01:32:13,427
>> NO. 

2780
01:32:13,427 --> 01:32:14,428
IN YOUR OPENING STATEMENT OCEAN 

2781
01:32:14,428 --> 01:32:15,496
I APPRECIATED YOUR REMARK -- 

2782
01:32:15,496 --> 01:32:16,697
YOU SAID, IT'S NOT ENOUGH, WE 

2783
01:32:16,697 --> 01:32:17,932
HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT PEOPLE 

2784
01:32:17,932 --> 01:32:18,733
USING FACEBOOK CAN'T HURT 

2785
01:32:18,733 --> 01:32:18,966
PEOPLE. 

2786
01:32:18,966 --> 01:32:20,368
AMERICA IS IN THE MIDST OF ONE 

2787
01:32:20,368 --> 01:32:21,569
OF THE WORST EPIDEMICS IT HAS 

2788
01:32:21,569 --> 01:32:26,007
EVER EXPERIENCED WITH THIS DRUG 

2789
01:32:26,007 --> 01:32:27,241
EPIDEMIC AND IT IS ALL ACROSS 

2790
01:32:27,241 --> 01:32:28,643
THE COUNTRY AND NOT JUST WEST 

2791
01:32:28,643 --> 01:32:29,677
VIRGINIA BUT YOUR PLATFORM IS 

2792
01:32:29,677 --> 01:32:35,149
STILL BEING USED TO CIRCUMVENT 

2793
01:32:35,149 --> 01:32:36,584
THE LAW AND ALLOW PEOPLE TO BUY 

2794
01:32:36,584 --> 01:32:37,918
HIGHLY ADDICTIVE DRUGS WITHOUT 

2795
01:32:37,918 --> 01:32:40,221
A PRESCRIPTION. 

2796
01:32:40,221 --> 01:32:41,255
WITH ALL DUE RESPECT, FACEBOOK 

2797
01:32:41,255 --> 01:32:43,491
IS ACTUALLY ENABLING ILLEGAL 

2798
01:32:43,491 --> 01:32:44,692
ACTIVITY AND IN SO DOING, YOU 

2799
01:32:44,692 --> 01:32:51,032
ARE HURTING PEOPLE. WOULD YOU 

2800
01:32:51,032 --> 01:32:52,399
AGREE WITH THAT STATEMENT? 

2801
01:32:52,399 --> 01:32:53,668
>> CONGRESSMAN, I THINK THERE 

2802
01:32:53,668 --> 01:32:55,469
ARE A NUMBER OF AREAS OF 

2803
01:32:55,469 --> 01:32:58,906
COUNTRY AND DOES CONTENT THAT 

2804
01:32:58,906 --> 01:33:00,541
WE COULD DO A BETTER JOB. 

2805
01:33:00,541 --> 01:33:04,211
TODAY, IN REVIEW, PEOPLE CAN 

2806
01:33:04,211 --> 01:33:05,980
SHARE WHAT THEY WANT OPENLY ON 

2807
01:33:05,980 --> 01:33:10,084
THE SERVICE AND IF SOMEONE SEES 

2808
01:33:10,084 --> 01:33:11,519
AN ISSUE, THEY CAN FIND IT TO 

2809
01:33:11,519 --> 01:33:19,226
US AND WE WILL REVIEW IT.    

2810
01:33:19,226 --> 01:33:20,661
>>  YOU CAN FIND OUT, MR. 

2811
01:33:20,661 --> 01:33:21,462
ZUCKERBERG, YOU KNOW WHICH 

2812
01:33:21,462 --> 01:33:22,129
PHARMACIES ARE OPERATING 

2813
01:33:22,129 --> 01:33:23,330
LEGALLY AND ILLEGALLY  BUT YOU 

2814
01:33:23,330 --> 01:33:25,099
CONTINUE TO ALLOW THAT TO BE 

2815
01:33:25,099 --> 01:33:27,802
POSTED ON FACEBOOK AND ALLOW 

2816
01:33:27,802 --> 01:33:28,802
PEOPLE TO GET THIS SCOURGE, 

2817
01:33:28,802 --> 01:33:33,441
THIS RAVAGE IN THIS COUNTRY 

2818
01:33:33,441 --> 01:33:34,275
BEING ENABLED BECAUSE OF 

2819
01:33:34,275 --> 01:33:34,542
FACEBOOK. 

2820
01:33:34,542 --> 01:33:36,444
MY QUESTION TO YOU AS WE CLOSE 

2821
01:33:36,444 --> 01:33:37,945
ON THIS, HE SAID BEFORE THAT 

2822
01:33:37,945 --> 01:33:39,146
YOU WERE GOING TO TAKE DOWN 

2823
01:33:39,146 --> 01:33:39,547
THOSE ADS. 

2824
01:33:39,547 --> 01:33:41,382
WHAT YOU DIDN'T DO IT. 

2825
01:33:41,382 --> 01:33:42,750
WE HAVE STATEMENT AFTER 

2826
01:33:42,750 --> 01:33:45,219
STATEMENT ABOUT THINGS. 

2827
01:33:45,219 --> 01:33:46,454
YOU'RE GOING TO TAKE THOSE DOWN 

2828
01:33:46,454 --> 01:33:48,289
IN DAYS AND THEY HAVEN'T GONE 

2829
01:33:48,289 --> 01:33:48,489
DOWN. 

2830
01:33:48,489 --> 01:33:56,029
THAT WAS JUST FROM YESTERDAY. 

2831
01:33:56,029 --> 01:33:56,831
IT IS STILL UP! 

2832
01:33:56,831 --> 01:33:58,265
SO MY QUESTION TO YOU IS, WHEN 

2833
01:33:58,265 --> 01:34:00,034
ARE YOU GOING TO TAKE DOWN 

2834
01:34:00,034 --> 01:34:00,534
THESE POSTS? 

2835
01:34:00,534 --> 01:34:02,269
THEY ARE DONE WITH THE ILLEGAL 

2836
01:34:02,269 --> 01:34:09,810
DIGITAL PHARMACIES.    

2837
01:34:09,810 --> 01:34:11,011
>>  RIGHT NOW, WHEN PEOPLE 

2838
01:34:11,011 --> 01:34:12,446
REPORT THEM TO US, WE WILL TAKE 

2839
01:34:12,446 --> 01:34:13,614
THEM DOWN .   

2840
01:34:13,614 --> 01:34:15,282
>>  YOU KNOW THAT THEY ARE UP 

2841
01:34:15,282 --> 01:34:15,716
THERE.  

2842
01:34:15,716 --> 01:34:16,950
WHERE IS YOUR REQUIREMENT? 

2843
01:34:16,950 --> 01:34:17,952
WHERE IS YOUR ACCOUNTABILITY TO 

2844
01:34:17,952 --> 01:34:24,859
ALLOW THIS TO BE OCCURRING? 

2845
01:34:24,859 --> 01:34:25,426
RAVAGING THIS COUNTRY? 

2846
01:34:25,426 --> 01:34:26,260
>> CONGRESSMAN, I AGREE THAT 

2847
01:34:26,260 --> 01:34:27,894
THIS IS A TERRIBLE ISSUE AND 

2848
01:34:27,894 --> 01:34:31,799
RESPECTFULLY, WHEN THERE ARE 

2849
01:34:31,799 --> 01:34:33,000
TENS OF BILLIONS OR 100 BILLION 

2850
01:34:33,000 --> 01:34:34,435
PIECES OF CONTENT SHARED EVERY 

2851
01:34:34,435 --> 01:34:38,239
DAY, EVEN 20,000 PEOPLE 

2852
01:34:38,239 --> 01:34:39,273
REVIEWING IT CANNOT LOOK AT 

2853
01:34:39,273 --> 01:34:39,573
EVERYTHING. 

2854
01:34:39,573 --> 01:34:40,875
WHAT WE NEED TO DO IS BUILD 

2855
01:34:40,875 --> 01:34:46,380
MORE AR TOOLS.    

2856
01:34:46,380 --> 01:34:47,782
>>  YOU HAVE SAID BEFORE THAT 

2857
01:34:47,782 --> 01:34:49,216
YOU ARE GOING TO TAKE THEM DOWN 

2858
01:34:49,216 --> 01:34:49,783
AND YOU HAVEN'T. 

2859
01:34:49,783 --> 01:34:50,651
>> THE CHAIR RECOGNIZES THE 

2860
01:34:50,651 --> 01:34:58,959
GENTLEMAN FROM BERNARD  -- 

2861
01:34:58,959 --> 01:34:59,226
VERMONT. 

2862
01:34:59,226 --> 01:34:59,960
>> YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT 

2863
01:34:59,960 --> 01:35:00,594
FACEBOOK MADE A MISTAKE. 

2864
01:35:00,594 --> 01:35:01,996
YOU DID AN ANALYSIS OF HOW IT 

2865
01:35:01,996 --> 01:35:02,296
HAPPENED. 

2866
01:35:02,296 --> 01:35:03,464
YOU PROMISED ACTION AND WE ARE 

2867
01:35:03,464 --> 01:35:04,698
AT THE POINT WHERE THE ACTION 

2868
01:35:04,698 --> 01:35:06,467
WILL SPEAK MUCH LOUDER THAN THE 

2869
01:35:06,467 --> 01:35:07,134
WORDS. 

2870
01:35:07,134 --> 01:35:08,335
BUT CONGRESS HAS MADE A 

2871
01:35:08,335 --> 01:35:08,602
MISTAKE. 

2872
01:35:08,602 --> 01:35:09,370
THIS EVENT THAT HAPPENED 

2873
01:35:09,370 --> 01:35:10,538
WHETHER IT WAS FACEBOOK OR SOME 

2874
01:35:10,538 --> 01:35:13,807
OTHER PLATFORM WAS FORESEEABLE 

2875
01:35:13,807 --> 01:35:14,809
AND INEVITABLE AND WE DID 

2876
01:35:14,809 --> 01:35:15,409
NOTHING ABOUT IT. 

2877
01:35:15,409 --> 01:35:16,844
CONGRESSMAN BLACKBURN AND I HAD 

2878
01:35:16,844 --> 01:35:22,516
A PROPHECY WORKING GROUP, SIX 

2879
01:35:22,516 --> 01:35:23,551
MEETINGS WITH MANY OF THE 

2880
01:35:23,551 --> 01:35:23,984
INDUSTRY PLAYERS. 

2881
01:35:23,984 --> 01:35:25,386
THERE WAS AN ACKNOWLEDGMENT ON 

2882
01:35:25,386 --> 01:35:25,786
BOTH SIDES. 

2883
01:35:25,786 --> 01:35:27,822
POLICY WAS NOT BEING PROTECTED. 

2884
01:35:27,822 --> 01:35:35,129
BUT THERE WAS AN INABILITY TO 

2885
01:35:35,129 --> 01:35:35,962
COME TO THE CONCLUSION. 

2886
01:35:35,962 --> 01:35:37,198
WE ALSO HAVE AN OBLIGATION AND 

2887
01:35:37,198 --> 01:35:38,399
IN AN EFFORT TO MOVE FORWARD, 

2888
01:35:38,399 --> 01:35:40,000
MR. ZUCKERBERG, I HAVE FRAMED 

2889
01:35:40,000 --> 01:35:41,268
SOME QUESTIONS. 

2890
01:35:41,268 --> 01:35:43,136
TO SEE IF THERE IS SOME COMMON 

2891
01:35:43,136 --> 01:35:47,708
GROUND, YOU HAVE AND WE 

2892
01:35:47,708 --> 01:35:48,542
CERTAINLY HAVE THE OBLIGATION 

2893
01:35:48,542 --> 01:35:50,911
TO PROTECT THE PRIVACY OF THE 

2894
01:35:50,911 --> 01:35:52,179
AMERICAN CONSUMERS. 

2895
01:35:52,179 --> 01:36:02,523
FIRST, DO YOU BELIEVE THAT 

2896
01:36:02,523 --> 01:36:03,557
CONSUMERS HAVE THE RIGHT TO 

2897
01:36:03,557 --> 01:36:04,558
KNOW AND CONTROL WHAT PERSONAL 

2898
01:36:04,558 --> 01:36:05,960
DATA COMPANIES COLLECT FROM 

2899
01:36:05,960 --> 01:36:06,160
THEM? 

2900
01:36:06,160 --> 01:36:09,930
>> YES. 

2901
01:36:09,930 --> 01:36:11,332
>> DO YOU THINK THEY HAVE A 

2902
01:36:11,332 --> 01:36:12,733
RIGHT TO KNOW HOW AND WITH WHOM 

2903
01:36:12,733 --> 01:36:13,567
THEIR PERSONAL INFORMATION IS 

2904
01:36:13,567 --> 01:36:16,370
SHARED WITH THIRD PARTIES?    

2905
01:36:16,370 --> 01:36:17,104
>>  OF COURSE. 

2906
01:36:17,104 --> 01:36:17,971
>> DO YOU BELIEVE CONSUMERS 

2907
01:36:17,971 --> 01:36:19,406

LIMITS ON THE PERSONAL DATA 

2914
01:36:29,350 --> 01:36:30,583

THAT'S GOOD. 

2938

>> CONGRESSMAN, I CERTAINLY 

2951

>>  CONGRESSMAN, I DID THAT 

2960
01:37:47,761 --> 01:37:49,029
THIS IS AN AREA WHERE SOME 

2961
01:37:49,029 --> 01:37:52,466

>>  CONGRESSMAN, IN GENERAL, 

3005
01:39:22,422 --> 01:39:34,435
THE WAY WE APPROACH DATA  AND 

3006
01:39:34,435 --> 01:39:35,669
LAW ENFORCEMENT IS THAT WE HAVE 

3007
01:39:35,669 --> 01:39:36,437
KNOWLEDGE OF IMMINENT HARM, 

3008
01:39:36,437 --> 01:39:37,471

THAT. 

3013
01:39:40,307 --> 01:39:41,708

IF SOMEONE PUT SOMETHING OUT 

3028
01:40:12,206 --> 01:40:13,407
THAT IS OVERLY BROAD, WE WILL 

3029

FIGHT BACK ON IT. 

3030
01:40:15,642 --> 01:40:16,877

01:42:16,730 --> 01:42:17,531
HIGH SCHOOL WHICH ISN'T 

3090
01:42:17,531 --> 01:42:18,565
ANYTHING LIKE ME AT ALL. 

3091
01:42:18,565 --> 01:42:21,401
THESE ACCOUNTS POP UP A LOT AND 

3092
01:42:21,401 --> 01:42:22,636
IT IS USING MY PICTURES AND 

3093
01:42:22,636 --> 01:42:25,239
EXTORTING PEOPLE FOR MONEY AND 

3094
01:42:25,239 --> 01:42:26,440
WE HEAR ABOUT IT FROM PEOPLE 

3095
01:42:26,440 --> 01:42:29,309
WHO CALL AND SAY, I WAS DUPED. 

3096
01:42:29,309 --> 01:42:30,310
I KNOW YOU CAN'T CONTROL 

3097
01:42:30,310 --> 01:42:32,079
EVERYTHING AND YOU HAVE A HUGE 

3098
01:42:32,079 --> 01:42:37,618
PLATFORM BUT CAN YOU TALK ABOUT 

3099
01:42:37,618 --> 01:42:38,852
SOME MOVEMENTS IN THE FUTURE TO 

3100
01:42:38,852 --> 01:42:40,287
TRY TO PREVENT THAT IN TERMS OF 

3101
01:42:40,287 --> 01:42:40,887
RECOGNIZING SOMEONE'S PICTURE 

3102
01:42:40,887 --> 01:42:41,954
AND IF IT IS FAKE IT 

3103
01:42:41,954 --> 01:42:42,522
>> YES, CONGRESSMAN. 

3104
01:42:42,522 --> 01:42:45,158
THIS IS AN IMPORTANT ISSUE. 

3105
01:42:45,158 --> 01:42:47,027
THAT'S HOW A LOT OF THE OTHER 

3106
01:42:47,027 --> 01:42:54,101
ISSUES AROUND FAKE NEWS AND FOR 

3107
01:42:54,101 --> 01:42:54,935
AN ELECTION INTERFERENCE ARE 

3108
01:42:54,935 --> 01:42:55,535
HAPPENING, AS WELL. 

3109
01:42:55,535 --> 01:42:56,570
THE LONG-TERM SOLUTION IS TO 

3110
01:42:56,570 --> 01:42:57,738
BUILD MORE AI TOOLS THAT FIND 

3111
01:42:57,738 --> 01:42:59,138
PATTERNS OF PEOPLE USING THE 

3112
01:42:59,138 --> 01:43:01,375
SERVICES THAT NO REAL PERSON 

3113
01:43:01,375 --> 01:43:01,808
WOULD DO. 

3114
01:43:01,808 --> 01:43:03,610
AND WE HAVE BEEN ABLE TO DO 

3115
01:43:03,610 --> 01:43:05,045
THAT IN ORDER TO TAKE DOWN TENS 

3116
01:43:05,045 --> 01:43:06,780
OF THOUSANDS OF ACCOUNTS 

3117
01:43:06,780 --> 01:43:16,023
ESPECIALLY IN ELECTIONS. 

3118
01:43:16,023 --> 01:43:17,491
AND LAST YEAR'S ALABAMA STATE 

3119
01:43:17,491 --> 01:43:21,495
ELECTION. 

3120
01:43:21,495 --> 01:43:22,095
SENATE ELECTION, SPECIAL 

3121
01:43:22,095 --> 01:43:22,362
ELECTION. 

3122
01:43:22,362 --> 01:43:23,764
AND THAT IS WHERE WE SHOULD BE 

3123
01:43:23,764 --> 01:43:24,798
ABLE TO EXTEND NETWORK AND 

3124
01:43:24,798 --> 01:43:27,401
DEVELOP MORE ARTICLES.    

3125
01:43:27,401 --> 01:43:28,635
>>  THE CHAIR RECOGNIZES THE 

3126
01:43:28,635 --> 01:43:31,771
GENTLEMAN FROM  NEW MEXICO. 

3127
01:43:31,771 --> 01:43:33,273
>> I WANT TO PICK UP WHERE MR.

3129
01:43:34,708 --> 01:43:35,709
FACEBOOK RECENTLY ANNOUNCED 

3130
01:43:35,709 --> 01:43:38,779
THAT A SEARCH FEATURE ALLOWING 

3131
01:43:38,779 --> 01:43:43,850
MALICIOUS ACTORS TO SCRAPE DATA 

3132
01:43:43,850 --> 01:43:45,552
ON ALL OF FACEBOOK'S 2 BILLION 

3133
01:43:45,552 --> 01:43:47,287
USERS. 

3134
01:43:47,287 --> 01:43:47,921
DEMONSTRATING THIS FEATURE 

3135
01:43:47,921 --> 01:43:49,690
COULD EASILY BE USED TOGETHER 

3136
01:43:49,690 --> 01:43:57,898
INFORMATION UPSCALE. THE ANSWER 

3137
01:43:57,898 --> 01:43:58,899
TO THAT QUESTION IS YES. 

3138
01:43:58,899 --> 01:43:59,499
YES OR NO. 

3139
01:43:59,499 --> 01:44:02,169
THIS ISSUE OF SCRAPING DATA WAS 

3140
01:44:02,169 --> 01:44:03,337
RAISED IN 2015 BY A CYBER 

3141
01:44:03,337 --> 01:44:06,907
SECURITY RESEARCHER, CORRECT?   

3142
01:44:06,907 --> 01:44:08,408
>>  I AM NOT SPECIFICALLY KNOW 

3143
01:44:08,408 --> 01:44:09,242
YOU'RE WITH THAT.  

3144
01:44:09,242 --> 01:44:10,243
THE FEATURE WE IDENTIFIED A 

3145
01:44:10,243 --> 01:44:13,246
COUPLE OF WEEKS AGO WAS A 

3146
01:44:13,246 --> 01:44:17,351
SEARCH FEATURE THAT ALLOWED 

3147
01:44:17,351 --> 01:44:18,385
PEOPLE TO LOOK UP SOME 

3148
01:44:18,385 --> 01:44:19,186
INFORMATION THAT PEOPLE HAD 

3149
01:44:19,186 --> 01:44:20,487
PUBLICLY SHARED, NAMES, PROFILE 

3150
01:44:20,487 --> 01:44:22,622
PICTURES. 

3151
01:44:22,622 --> 01:44:34,468
BUT I WILL RECOGNIZE THAT IN 

3152
01:44:34,468 --> 01:44:34,868
THE FUTURE. 

3153
01:44:34,868 --> 01:44:36,069
MY QUESTION AND THE REASON I'M 

3154
01:44:36,069 --> 01:44:37,270
ASKING ABOUT 2013 AND 2015 IS 

3155
01:44:37,270 --> 01:44:38,271
THAT FACEBOOK KNEW ABOUT THIS 

3156
01:44:38,271 --> 01:44:39,706
AT THAT TIME AND DID NOT TURN 

3157
01:44:39,706 --> 01:44:40,707
THE FEATURE OFF UNTIL WEDNESDAY 

3158
01:44:40,707 --> 01:44:41,308
OF LAST WEEK. 

3159
01:44:41,308 --> 01:44:42,542
THE SAME PICTURE THAT MISSED IT 

3160
01:44:42,542 --> 01:44:43,777
OR JUST TALKED ABOUT WHERE THIS 

3161
01:44:43,777 --> 01:44:44,978
IS ESSENTIALLY A TOOL FOR THESE 

3162
01:44:44,978 --> 01:44:45,979
MALICIOUS ACTORS TO GO AND 

3163
01:44:45,979 --> 01:44:46,813
STILL SOMEONE'S IDENTITY AND 

3164
01:44:46,813 --> 01:44:50,884
PUT THE FISHING -- AND PUT THE 

3165
01:44:50,884 --> 01:44:51,685
FINISHING TOUCHES ON IT. 

3166
01:44:51,685 --> 01:44:52,686
ONE OF YOUR MENTORS HAS 

3167
01:44:52,686 --> 01:44:53,720
RECENTLY SAID YOUR BUSINESS IS 

3168
01:44:53,720 --> 01:44:54,321
BASED ON TRUST. 

3169
01:44:54,321 --> 01:44:56,356
WHY DID IT TAKE SO LONG? 

3170
01:44:56,356 --> 01:44:57,657
ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU'RE TALKING 

3171
01:44:57,657 --> 01:45:04,931
ABOUT THESE OTHER ISSUES. 

3172
01:45:04,931 --> 01:45:06,767
LEAVING MANY PEOPLE VULNERABLE. 

3173
01:45:06,767 --> 01:45:10,003
ONTO ANOTHER SUBJECT, FACEBOOK

THE KIND OF SCRAPING THAT YOU 

3181
01:45:25,786 --> 01:45:28,388
ARE REFERRING TO. 

3182
01:45:28,388 --> 01:45:31,458
CONGRESSMAN, I AM NOT FAMILIAR 

3183
01:45:31,458 --> 01:45:32,459
WITH THAT.

3184
01:45:32,459 --> 01:45:40,267

I DO NOT KNOW OFF THE TOP OF MY

3194
01:45:56,082 --> 01:45:57,684
DO YOU KNOW HOW MANY POINTS OF 

3195
01:45:57,684 --> 01:45:58,919
DATA THAT FACEBOOK HAS ON THE 

3196
01:45:58,919 --> 01:46:01,354

CAN HAVE OUR TEAM GET BACK TO

01:46:06,193 --> 01:46:07,661

NON-AVERAGE USER. 

3203
01:46:11,764 --> 01:46:16,203
MY QUESTION IS, CAN SOMEONE WHO 

3204
01:46:16,203 --> 01:46:17,203

PASSIONATE ABOUT IT. 

3275
01:48:22,128 --> 01:48:23,362
MY DISTRICT IS VERY SIMILAR. 

3276
01:48:23,362 --> 01:48:29,469
WEST VIRGINIA BORDERS IT. 

3277
01:48:29,469 --> 01:48:30,837

FOLLOW 

3282
02:03:45,551 --> 02:03:46,218
>>> HE HAS BEEN FIELDING 

3283
02:03:46,218 --> 02:03:47,520
QUESTIONS ON A NUMBER OF ISSUES 

3284
02:03:47,520 --> 02:03:50,822
INCLUDING THE CAMBRIDGE 

3285
02:03:50,822 --> 02:03:51,724
ANALYTICAL DATA SCANDAL.  

3286
02:03:51,724 --> 02:03:54,259
WE WILL GET RIGHT BACK TO THE 

3287
02:03:54,259 --> 02:03:58,130
TESTIMONY IN JUST A MINUTE.  

3288
02:03:58,130 --> 02:03:58,697
WE WANT TO BRING YOU UP TO 

3289
02:03:58,697 --> 02:03:59,365
SPEED ON OTHER DEVELOPMENTS.  

3290
02:03:59,365 --> 02:04:03,902
AT THIS HOUR AT THE U.S. IS ON 

3291
02:04:03,902 --> 02:04:04,436
THE BRINK OF TAKING THREE 

3292
02:04:04,436 --> 02:04:08,674
ACTION AGAINST SYRIA.  

3293
02:04:08,674 --> 02:04:10,041
TODAY THE PRESIDENT PUBLICLY 

3294
02:04:10,041 --> 02:04:15,213
VOWED TO TEST RUSSIA'S A 

3295
02:04:15,213 --> 02:04:15,847
MISSILE DEFENSE SYSTEM IN SYRIA 

3296
02:04:15,847 --> 02:04:19,718
BY TWEETING "MISSILES WILL BE 

3297
02:04:19,718 --> 02:04:30,095
COMING, NICE, NEW AND SMART."  

3298
02:04:30,095 --> 02:04:39,805
THIS IS THE LATEST ESCALATION 

3299
02:04:39,805 --> 02:04:40,439
IN TENSIONS BETWEEN RUSSIA AND 

3300
02:04:40,439 --> 02:04:41,040
THE U.S.  THE PRESIDENT SAID 

3301
02:04:41,040 --> 02:04:41,607
TODAY OUR RELATIONSHIP WITH 

3302
02:04:41,607 --> 02:04:42,241
RUSSIA IS WORSE NOW THAN IT WAS 

3303
02:04:42,241 --> 02:04:45,610
DURING THE COLD WAR.  

3304
02:04:45,610 --> 02:04:46,244
THE PRESIDENT DID ADD THERE IS 

3305
02:04:46,244 --> 02:04:46,745
NO REASON FOR THIS AND 

3306
02:04:46,745 --> 02:04:50,182
ENCOURAGED ALL NATIONS TO WORK 

3307
02:04:50,182 --> 02:04:54,086
TOGETHER.  

3308
02:04:54,086 --> 02:04:54,719
THE TENSIONS WERE PROVOKED BY A 

3309
02:04:54,719 --> 02:04:55,353
ALLEGED DEADLY CHEMICAL ATTACK. 

3310
02:04:55,353 --> 02:04:55,887
THE SYRIAN GOVERNMENT WAS 

3311
02:04:55,887 --> 02:04:56,455
ACCUSED OF CARRYING OUT THE 

3312
02:04:56,455 --> 02:04:57,590
ASSAULT BUT DENIES ANY 

3313
02:04:57,590 --> 02:04:57,957
INVOLVEMENT. 

3314
02:04:57,957 --> 02:05:02,628
RUSSIA IS STANDING BY SYRIA AND 

3315
02:05:02,628 --> 02:05:03,562
WARNING OF SERIOUS 

3316
02:05:03,562 --> 02:05:04,196
REPERCUSSIONS IF THE U.S. OR 

3317
02:05:04,196 --> 02:05:10,235
OTHER NATIONS STRIKE.  AS THIS 

3318
02:05:10,235 --> 02:05:10,869
UNFOLD AS WAS THE THIRD PERSON 

3319
02:05:10,869 --> 02:05:11,469
IN LINE TO THE PRESIDENCY HAS 

3320
02:05:11,469 --> 02:05:17,976
ANNOUNCED HE WILL LEAVE OFFICE.

3321
02:05:17,976 --> 02:05:22,114
>> I THINK WE HAVE ACHIEVED A 

3322
02:05:22,114 --> 02:05:23,682
LOT.  

3323
02:05:23,682 --> 02:05:24,249
YOU ALL KNOW THAT I DID NOT 

3324
02:05:24,249 --> 02:05:24,950
SEEK THIS JOB.  

3325
02:05:24,950 --> 02:05:27,286
I TOOK IT RELUCTANTLY, BUT I 

3326
02:05:27,286 --> 02:05:42,134
HAVE GIVEN THIS JOB MY ALL.  

3327
02:05:42,134 --> 02:05:46,872
I HAVE NO REGRETS WHAT SO EVER, 

3328
02:05:46,872 --> 02:05:48,106
THIS HAS BEEN ONE OF THE MOST 

3329
02:05:48,106 --> 02:05:55,747
TWO GREATEST OWNERS OF MY LIFE. 

3330
02:05:55,747 --> 02:05:58,217
THE JOB PROVIDES INCREDIBLE 

3331
02:05:58,217 --> 02:06:06,692
OPPORTUNITIES.

3332
02:06:48,934 --> 02:06:56,909
>>> CONGRESS IS NOT GOING TO DO 

3333
02:06:56,909 --> 02:06:57,476
A LOT ANYWAY, THE TIMING IS 

3334
02:06:57,476 --> 02:06:58,110
DICTATED BECAUSE SOMETHING LIKE 

3335
02:06:58,110 --> 02:06:58,677
THIS CAN'T BE A SECRET IN 

3336
02:06:58,677 --> 02:06:58,877
WASHINGTON.

3337
02:07:06,218 --> 02:07:06,818
AT THE CONGRESS THEY HAVE TO 

3338
02:07:06,818 --> 02:07:07,385
FIGURE OUT WHO IS GOING TO 

3339
02:07:07,385 --> 02:07:08,653
REPLACE HIM AS LEADER OR SPEAKER

3340
02:07:08,653 --> 02:07:09,421
DEPENDING ON IF REPUBLICANS 

3341
02:07:09,421 --> 02:07:10,656
HOLD ON TO THE HOUSE.  

3342
02:07:10,656 --> 02:07:12,858
IN TERMS OF LEGISLATING THERE 

3343
02:07:12,858 --> 02:07:14,593
IS NOT A LOT OF CHOOSE THAT 

3344
02:07:14,593 --> 02:07:15,694
PAUL RYAN HAS.  

3345
02:07:15,694 --> 02:07:18,230
LAWMAKERS AT THIS POINT HAVE 

3346
02:07:18,230 --> 02:07:21,233
HIT THAT STAGE WHERE THEY ARE 

3347
02:07:21,233 --> 02:07:22,768
FOCUSED ON THE ONLY ELECTION.  

3348
02:07:22,768 --> 02:07:28,439
THERE -- THERE IS NOT ANY -- 

3349
02:07:28,439 --> 02:07:30,109
THERE IS NOT A LOT LEFT ON 

3350
02:07:30,109 --> 02:07:32,645
THEIR PLATE TO ACTUALLY DO OF 

3351
02:07:32,645 --> 02:07:33,512
ANY STEP SINCE.  

3352
02:07:33,512 --> 02:07:37,015
NOTHING THAT WILL BRING IN A 

3353
02:07:37,015 --> 02:07:38,250
STRICT PARTY LINE VOTES.  

3354
02:07:38,250 --> 02:07:41,920
SO THAT IS IN A WAY THE OBVIOUS 

3355
02:07:41,920 --> 02:07:42,487
TIME FOR HIM TO MAKE THE 

3356
02:07:42,487 --> 02:07:45,424
ANNOUNCEMENT.

3357
02:07:45,424 --> 02:07:46,591
>> WE HEARD THE SPEAKER TRIED 

3358
02:07:46,591 --> 02:07:47,192
TO ASSURE MEMBERS IN HIS OWN 

3359
02:07:47,192 --> 02:07:49,762
PARTY THAT THINGS WILL BE FINE. 

3360
02:07:49,762 --> 02:07:52,130
HOW DOES THIS MOVE IMPACT 

3361
02:07:52,130 --> 02:07:54,233
REPUBLICANS CHANCES IN THE 

3362
02:07:54,233 --> 02:07:56,635
MIDTERMS?

3363
02:07:56,635 --> 02:07:57,669
>> IT IS NOT BOOSTING 

3364
02:07:57,669 --> 02:07:59,304
CONFIDENCE FOR REPUBLICANS.  

3365
02:07:59,304 --> 02:08:01,907
THEY ARE KIND OF FACING 

3366
02:08:01,907 --> 02:08:02,207
HEADWINDS.  

3367
02:08:02,207 --> 02:08:04,143
IF NOT IT IS VERY

3368
02:08:04,143 --> 02:08:07,346
CHALLENGING YEAR FOR THEM WITH A

3369
02:08:07,346 --> 02:08:08,414
COULD HAVE A LANDSLIDE FOR 

3370
02:08:08,414 --> 02:08:14,953
DEMOCRATS COME NOVEMBER.  

3371
02:08:14,953 --> 02:08:15,586
SOME OF THAT DEPENDS ON SPEAKER 

3372
02:08:15,586 --> 02:08:15,820
RYAN.  

3373
02:08:15,820 --> 02:08:16,354
HE HAS BEEN A VERY STRONG 

3374
02:08:16,354 --> 02:08:17,822
FUNDRAISER FOR HIS PARTY.  

3375
02:08:17,822 --> 02:08:18,690
ONE OF THE STRONGEST REPUBLICAN 

3376
02:08:18,690 --> 02:08:21,025
LEADERS IN RECENT MEMORY.  

3377
02:08:21,025 --> 02:08:22,194
THAT HAS BEEN A BIG HELP TO 

3378
02:08:22,194 --> 02:08:26,131
REPUBLICANS.  

3379
02:08:26,131 --> 02:08:26,631
THE OTHER FACTOR IS THE 

3380
02:08:26,631 --> 02:08:27,232
PRESIDENT, HE HAS NOT BEEN SO 

3381
02:08:27,232 --> 02:08:27,765
HELPFUL ON THAT FRONT.  

3382
02:08:27,765 --> 02:08:30,135
WHETHER IT BE DOMINATING 

3383
02:08:30,135 --> 02:08:33,572
HEADLINES, NOT FOCUSING ON 

3384
02:08:33,572 --> 02:08:34,172
SELLING THE TAX REFORM BILL, 

3385
02:08:34,172 --> 02:08:37,309
THINGS LIKE THAT.  

3386
02:08:37,309 --> 02:08:37,909
RANK AND FILE REPUBLICANS ARE 

3387
02:08:37,909 --> 02:08:39,578
NOT TAKING THIS NEWS -- THEY 

3388
02:08:39,578 --> 02:08:41,613
ARE NOT SURPRISED BUT THEY ARE 

3389
02:08:41,613 --> 02:08:43,916
NOT THRILLED BY IT BECAUSE THEY 

3390
02:08:43,916 --> 02:08:45,684
WOULD RATHER SPEAKER RYAN BE 

3391
02:08:45,684 --> 02:08:46,585
WITH THEM ON THEIR SIDE 

3392
02:08:46,585 --> 02:08:51,957
FUNDRAISING FOR THEM. 

3393
02:08:51,957 --> 02:08:52,891
THEY ARE A LITTLE WORRIED NOW 

3394
02:08:52,891 --> 02:08:54,193
THAT HE IS STEPPING OUT. 

3395
02:08:54,193 --> 02:08:58,464
>> IN TERMS OF WHO MAY BE NEXT, 

3396
02:08:58,464 --> 02:09:01,233
WE KNOW KEVIN MCCARTHY AND 

3397
02:09:01,233 --> 02:09:02,400
STEVE SCALISE ARE REPORTEDLY 

3398
02:09:02,400 --> 02:09:04,903
GOING TO LIVE FOR THE ROLE.  

3399
02:09:04,903 --> 02:09:06,205
DOES EITHER HAVE A CLEAR 

3400
02:09:06,205 --> 02:09:07,339
ADVANTAGE?

3401
02:09:07,339 --> 02:09:10,109
>> NOT NECESSARILY. 

3402
02:09:10,109 --> 02:09:12,978
OBVIOUSLY KEVIN MCCARTHY HAS 

3403
02:09:12,978 --> 02:09:13,578
TRIED TO MAKE THE MOVE BEFORE 

3404
02:09:13,578 --> 02:09:15,113
BUT NOW HAS A BETTER GRASP ON 

3405
02:09:15,113 --> 02:09:17,149
THE HOUSE REPUBLICAN CONFERENCE.

3406
02:09:17,149 --> 02:09:22,221
STEVE SCALISE, HAS A LOT OF 

3407
02:09:22,221 --> 02:09:27,659
SUPPORTERS, IT WILL BE 

3408
02:09:27,659 --> 02:09:28,293
INTERESTING TO SEE IF THEY BOTH 

3409
02:09:28,293 --> 02:09:28,894
ACTUALLY GO FOR IT OR IF THEY 

3410
02:09:28,894 --> 02:09:29,494
TRY TO CUT A DEAL BETWEEN THE 

3411
02:09:29,494 --> 02:09:30,095
TWO OF THEM.  

3412
02:09:30,095 --> 02:09:31,296
THEY HAVE WORKED SO CLOSELY 

3413
02:09:31,296 --> 02:09:34,233
TOGETHER.  BUT WILL THE SPIRIT 

3414
02:09:34,233 --> 02:09:36,635
OF COOPERATION RAIN OR WILL 

3415
02:09:36,635 --> 02:09:38,136
PERSONAL AMBITION TAKE OVER?  

3416
02:09:38,136 --> 02:09:42,140
THAT IS WHAT WE WILL BE 

3417
02:09:42,140 --> 02:09:42,407
WATCHING.

3418
02:09:42,407 --> 02:09:44,409
>> PRESIDENT TRUMP VOWING TO 

3419
02:09:44,409 --> 02:09:47,913
STRIKE SYRIA, AS A CANDIDATE HE 

3420
02:09:47,913 --> 02:09:50,015
CRITICIZED OFFICIALS FOR 

3421
02:09:50,015 --> 02:09:50,615
TELEGRAPHING MILITARY MOVES.  

3422
02:09:50,615 --> 02:09:52,885
ISN'T THAT WHAT HE DID TODAY?

3423
02:09:52,885 --> 02:09:54,219
>> THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT THE 

3424
02:09:54,219 --> 02:09:58,123
PRESIDENT DID.  

3425
02:09:58,123 --> 02:10:00,492
HE DIDN'T QUITE GIVE US THE DATE

3426
02:10:00,492 --> 02:10:02,627
AND TIME OR LOCATION BUT HE 

3427
02:10:02,627 --> 02:10:08,367
MADE IT PRETTY CLEAR -- ON 

3428
02:10:08,367 --> 02:10:09,001
MONDAY HE SAID HE WOULD MAKE A 

3429
02:10:09,001 --> 02:10:10,235
DECISION, THAT CLOCK HAS 

3430
02:10:10,235 --> 02:10:12,136
EXPIRED, IT IS VERY CLEAR THE 

3431
02:10:12,136 --> 02:10:14,106
PRESIDENT WANTS TO TAKE 

3432
02:10:14,106 --> 02:10:17,976
MILITARY ACTION.  

3433
02:10:17,976 --> 02:10:18,543
THAT IS TELEGRAPHING, DOING 

3434
02:10:18,543 --> 02:10:19,177
EXACTLY WHAT HE SAID HE DID NOT 

3435
02:10:19,177 --> 02:10:19,744
WANT TO DO AS A CANDIDATE.  

3436
02:10:19,744 --> 02:10:23,515
WHAT THE POTENTIAL STRIKE LOOKS 

3437
02:10:23,515 --> 02:10:25,250
LIKE, WHO ELSE IS INVOLVED, 

3438
02:10:25,250 --> 02:10:27,786
THOSE ARE THE PURE ON THE TABLE.

3439
02:10:27,786 --> 02:10:31,122
JUST HOW LARGE A SCALE IT BACK 

3440
02:10:31,122 --> 02:10:33,425
WITHIN CONCERT WITH WHICH 

3441
02:10:33,425 --> 02:10:34,192
PARTNERS, THAT IS THE NATURE OF 

3442
02:10:34,192 --> 02:10:35,027
THIS

3443
02:10:35,027 --> 02:10:39,431
DISCUSSION RIGHT NOW.  

3444
02:10:39,431 --> 02:10:40,064
IT COULD BE ANYTHING FROM TODAY 

3445
02:10:40,064 --> 02:10:42,600
TO SOMETIME THIS WEEKEND.  

3446
02:10:42,600 --> 02:10:43,201
THE PRESIDENT CANCELING HIS 

3447
02:10:43,201 --> 02:10:46,905
TRIP TO MONITOR THE SITUATION.  

3448
02:10:46,905 --> 02:10:47,538
SOMETIME IN THE NEXT COUPLE OF 

3449
02:10:47,538 --> 02:10:48,273
DAYS HE WILL SEE SOME SORT OF 

3450
02:10:48,273 --> 02:10:48,506
ACTION.

3451
02:10:48,506 --> 02:10:53,212
>> TAKE THE TEMPERATURE, THE 

3452
02:10:53,212 --> 02:10:53,845
DEVELOPMENTS IN THE LAST WEEK, 

3453
02:10:53,845 --> 02:10:59,751
HOW HAVE THEY IMPACTED THE 

3454
02:10:59,751 --> 02:11:00,384
PRESIDENT'S ROSE WITH VLADIMIR 

3455
02:11:00,384 --> 02:11:00,585
PUTIN?

3456
02:11:00,585 --> 02:11:06,158
>> THAT IS NOT THE CASE RIGHT 

3457
02:11:06,158 --> 02:11:06,358
NOW.  

3458
02:11:06,358 --> 02:11:06,925
THERE IS NOT A RELATIONSHIP 

3459
02:11:06,925 --> 02:11:09,127
BETWEEN THE PRESIDENT OF THE 

3460
02:11:09,127 --> 02:11:10,195
UNITED STATES AND THE PRESIDENT 

3461
02:11:10,195 --> 02:11:12,831
OF RUSSIA.  

3462
02:11:12,831 --> 02:11:13,398
THE UNITED STATES IS ON THE 

3463
02:11:13,398 --> 02:11:15,934
BRINK OF BOMBING ONE OF HIS 

3464
02:11:15,934 --> 02:11:17,202
CLOSEST ALLIES IN THE MIDDLE 

3465
02:11:17,202 --> 02:11:17,970
EAST.  

3466
02:11:17,970 --> 02:11:20,305
THERE HAVE BEEN NEW SANCTIONS 

3467
02:11:20,305 --> 02:11:20,872
OVER ELECTION HACKING. 

3468
02:11:20,872 --> 02:11:25,410
ALL OF THAT IS BUILDING 

3469
02:11:25,410 --> 02:11:26,111
TENSIONS BETWEEN THE PRESIDENT 

3470
02:11:26,111 --> 02:11:30,115
AND VLADIMIR PUTIN.  IN CASES 

3471
02:11:30,115 --> 02:11:34,953
LIKE THIS FOR ALL THE PRESIDENT

3472
02:11:34,953 --> 02:11:36,154
'S GOOD INTENTIONS HE DOES NOT 

3473
02:11:36,154 --> 02:11:39,524
HAVE THAT MUCH OF A CHOICE.  

3474
02:11:39,524 --> 02:11:40,057
SOMETHING LIKE A CHEMICAL 

3475
02:11:40,057 --> 02:11:41,960
WEAPONS ATTACK CANNOT GO 

3476
02:11:41,960 --> 02:11:42,227
IGNORED.  

3477
02:11:42,227 --> 02:11:46,231
THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT IS 

3478
02:11:46,231 --> 02:11:49,968
HAPPENING HERE.  

3479
02:11:49,968 --> 02:11:50,535
THAT IS SORT OF WHAT WE ARE 

3480
02:11:50,535 --> 02:11:51,135
SEEING IN THE TWEETS FROM THE 

3481
02:11:51,135 --> 02:11:51,436
PRESIDENT.  

3482
02:11:51,436 --> 02:11:52,036
HE IS SAYING, YOU ARE FORCING 

3483
02:11:52,036 --> 02:11:55,874
ME TO DO THIS.  

3484
02:11:55,874 --> 02:11:56,441
IF YOU CHANGE YOUR BEHAVIOR 

3485
02:11:56,441 --> 02:11:57,008
MAYBE WE CAN HAVE A BETTER 

3486
02:11:57,008 --> 02:11:57,575
RELATIONSHIP BUT RIGHT NOW 

3487
02:11:57,575 --> 02:11:59,678
TENSIONS ARE MORE HEATED.

3488
02:11:59,678 --> 02:12:03,781
>> ON TUESDAY SARAH SANDERS 

3489
02:12:03,781 --> 02:12:07,920
SAID PRESIDENT TRUMP BELIEVES 

3490
02:12:07,920 --> 02:12:08,520
HE HAS THE AUTHORITY TO FIRE 

3491
02:12:08,520 --> 02:12:09,388
SPECIAL COUNSEL ROBERT MUELLER. 

3492
02:12:09,388 --> 02:12:12,324
WHAT HAS BEEN THE RESPONSE FROM 

3493
02:12:12,324 --> 02:12:14,559
BOTH SIDES OF THE AISLE?

3494
02:12:14,559 --> 02:12:15,694
>> THE FIRST THING YOU WILL 

3495
02:12:15,694 --> 02:12:18,229
HEAR IS FROM THE LAWYERS, WHO 

3496
02:12:18,229 --> 02:12:20,899
SAY, REGULATIONS SAY ONLY ROD 

3497
02:12:20,899 --> 02:12:26,504
ROSENSTEIN HAS THE AUTHORITY TO 

3498
02:12:26,504 --> 02:12:28,807
FIRE ROBERT MUELLER.  

3499
02:12:28,807 --> 02:12:30,108
THAT IS THE FIRST THING YOU 

3500
02:12:30,108 --> 02:12:32,577
WILL HEAR.  

3501
02:12:32,577 --> 02:12:33,644
THE WHITE HOUSE CONTENDS THAT 

3502
02:12:33,644 --> 02:12:34,312
DOES NOT APPLY TO THE PRESIDENT.

3503
02:12:34,312 --> 02:12:36,848
THEY ARE STILL SORTING THROUGH 

3504
02:12:36,848 --> 02:12:39,250
THAT LEGAL RATIONALE, WORKING 

3505
02:12:39,250 --> 02:12:43,188
ON THAT INTERNALLY. 

3506
02:12:43,188 --> 02:12:44,456
ON CAPITOL HILL DEMOCRATS AND 

3507
02:12:44,456 --> 02:12:45,023
REPUBLICANS ARE TELLING THE 

3508
02:12:45,023 --> 02:12:47,192
PRESIDENT DON'T DO THIS.  

3509
02:12:47,192 --> 02:12:48,860
YOU MAY NOT LIKE THE GUY,

3510
02:12:48,860 --> 02:12:53,297
BUT YOU OPEN A CAN OF WORMS IF 

3511
02:12:53,297 --> 02:12:54,232
YOU WERE TO FIRE THE SPECIAL 

3512
02:12:54,232 --> 02:12:55,200
COUNSEL.  

3513
02:12:55,200 --> 02:12:56,368
YOU DON'T KNOW WHERE THAT IS 

3514
02:12:56,368 --> 02:12:56,601
GOING TO

3515
02:12:56,601 --> 02:12:59,137
END UP.  

3516
02:12:59,137 --> 02:12:59,771
IT DOES NOT END UP ANYWHERE 

3517
02:12:59,771 --> 02:13:00,572
GOOD.  

3518
02:13:00,572 --> 02:13:05,010
IT COULD POTENTIALLY MEAN 

3519
02:13:05,010 --> 02:13:08,480
IMPEACHMENT, IT WILL CREATE 

3520
02:13:08,480 --> 02:13:10,849
MORE LEGAL LIABILITY FOR YOU.  

3521
02:13:10,849 --> 02:13:15,987
LAWMAKERS ON CAPITOL HILL 

3522
02:13:15,987 --> 02:13:16,988
POTENTIALLY TRYING TO PROTECT 

3523
02:13:16,988 --> 02:13:17,622
THE SPECIAL COUNSEL, WILL THAT 

3524
02:13:17,622 --> 02:13:18,256
PASS?  

3525
02:13:18,256 --> 02:13:19,458
CANNOT PASS?  

3526
02:13:19,458 --> 02:13:23,294
THAT -- CAN THAT PASS?  

3527
02:13:23,294 --> 02:13:26,297
THAT REMAINS TO BE SEEN.  

3528
02:13:26,297 --> 02:13:28,834
THAT CERTAINLY IS THE NATURE OF 

3529
02:13:28,834 --> 02:13:29,201
THE DISCUSSION.

3530
02:13:29,201 --> 02:13:32,037
>> REPUBLICANS AND DEMOCRATS 

3531
02:13:32,037 --> 02:13:35,073
JOINING THAT CHORUS.  

3532
02:13:35,073 --> 02:13:36,441
THANK YOU.

3533
02:13:36,441 --> 02:13:43,081
>> THANK YOU.

3534
02:13:46,218 --> 02:13:55,326
>>> MARK ZUCKERBERG IS BACK ON 

3535
02:13:55,326 --> 02:13:55,960
CAPITOL HILL FOR A 2ND ROUND OF 

3536
02:13:55,960 --> 02:13:56,494
GRILLING FROM LAWMAKERS.  

3537
02:13:56,494 --> 02:13:57,128
TODAY HE IS TESTIFYING BETWEEN 

3538
02:13:57,128 --> 02:13:57,762
THE HOUSE ENERGY AND COMMERCE 

3539
02:13:57,762 --> 02:13:58,997
COMMITTEE.  

3540
02:13:58,997 --> 02:13:59,898
HE FACED HOURS OF QUESTIONING 

3541
02:13:59,898 --> 02:14:00,198
YESTERDAY. 

3542
02:14:00,198 --> 02:14:04,770
FACEBOOK IS A FACING GROWING 

3543
02:14:04,770 --> 02:14:06,204
PRESSURE TO PROTECT USER'S 

3544
02:14:06,204 --> 02:14:07,706
PRIVACY.  

3545
02:14:07,706 --> 02:14:11,109
HERE IS MARK ZUCKERBERG BEING 

3546
02:14:11,109 --> 02:14:14,145
QUESTIONED IT TODAY.

3547
02:14:14,145 --> 02:14:15,547
>> YOU HAVE THE CAPABILITY TO 

3548
02:14:15,547 --> 02:14:18,316
AUDIT DEVELOPERS FACEBOOK USER. 

3549
02:14:18,316 --> 02:14:26,124
THE PROBLEM AT FACEBOOK IT 

3550
02:14:26,124 --> 02:14:26,624
PROLIFERATED, IN FACT, 

3551
02:14:26,624 --> 02:14:27,191
RELATIVES TO OTHER TYPES OF 

3552
02:14:27,191 --> 02:14:27,725
PROBLEMS YOU HAD ON YOUR 

3553
02:14:27,725 --> 02:14:30,361
PLATFORM IT SEEMS AS THOUGH YOU 

3554
02:14:30,361 --> 02:14:34,266
TURNED A BLIND EYE TO THIS, 

3555
02:14:34,266 --> 02:14:36,034
CORRECT?

3556
02:14:36,034 --> 02:14:37,168
>> I DISAGREE WITH THAT 

3557
02:14:37,168 --> 02:14:37,502
ASSESSMENT.  

3558
02:14:37,502 --> 02:14:38,103
I THINK GOING FORWARD WE NEED 

3559
02:14:38,103 --> 02:14:39,204
TO TAKE A MORE PROACTIVE TO VIEW

3560
02:14:39,204 --> 02:14:42,107
OF POLICING WHAT THE DEVELOPERS 

3561
02:14:42,107 --> 02:14:43,975
DO.  

3562
02:14:43,975 --> 02:14:47,345
BUT LOOKING BACK, WE INVESTIGATE

3563
02:14:47,345 --> 02:14:47,979
-- 

3564
02:14:47,979 --> 02:14:48,780
>> IT SEEMS TO US LIKE YOU WERE 

3565
02:14:48,780 --> 02:14:50,382
MORE CONCERNED WITH THE 

3566
02:14:50,382 --> 02:14:54,119
ATTRACTING AND RETAINING 

3567
02:14:54,119 --> 02:14:54,686
DEVELOPERS ON YOUR PLATFORM 

3568
02:14:54,686 --> 02:14:55,753
THEN YOU WERE WITH ENSURING THE 

3569
02:14:55,753 --> 02:14:58,590
SECURITY OF FACEBOOK USER DATA. 

3570
02:14:58,590 --> 02:15:01,593
THERE IS A REAL TRUST GAP HERE. 

3571
02:15:01,593 --> 02:15:06,131
THIS DEVELOPER DATA ISSUE IS 

3572
02:15:06,131 --> 02:15:08,699
ONE EXAMPLE BUT WHY SHOULD WE 

3573
02:15:08,699 --> 02:15:09,333
TRUST YOU TO FOLLOW THROUGH ON 

3574
02:15:09,333 --> 02:15:09,934
THESE PROMISES WHEN YOU HAVE 

3575
02:15:09,934 --> 02:15:10,501
DEMONSTRATED THAT YOU ARE 

3576
02:15:10,501 --> 02:15:16,907
WILLING -- WHEN THE NEED TO 

3577
02:15:16,907 --> 02:15:18,310
SUITS YOU. 

3578
02:15:18,310 --> 02:15:22,114
>> CONGRESSMAN I DISAGREE WITH 

3579
02:15:22,114 --> 02:15:23,815
THAT CHARACTERIZATION.  

3580
02:15:23,815 --> 02:15:26,118
WE HAVE HAD A REVIEW PROCESS 

3581
02:15:26,118 --> 02:15:30,188
FOR YEARS.  

3582
02:15:30,188 --> 02:15:30,721
WE HAVE REVIEWED TENS OF 

3583
02:15:30,721 --> 02:15:31,322
THOUSANDS OF APPS A YEAR AND 

3584
02:15:31,322 --> 02:15:33,024
TAKEN ACTION AGAINST A NUMBER 

3585
02:15:33,024 --> 02:15:33,859
OF THEM.  

3586
02:15:33,859 --> 02:15:34,459
THE PROCESS WAS NOT ENOUGH TO 

3587
02:15:34,459 --> 02:15:37,829
CATCH A DEVELOPER -- 

3588
02:15:37,829 --> 02:15:42,901
>> I SEE MY TIME IS ALMOST OVER.

3589
02:15:42,901 --> 02:15:44,069
TO MY MIND THE ONLY WAY WE 

3590
02:15:44,069 --> 02:15:44,703
CLOSE THIS TRUST GAP IS THROUGH 

3591
02:15:44,703 --> 02:15:53,678
LEGISLATION THAT EMPOWERS US.  

3592
02:15:53,678 --> 02:15:54,311
WE NEED TO PROTECT THE DIGITAL 

3593
02:15:54,311 --> 02:15:54,812
PRIVACY AND ENSURE THAT 

3594
02:15:54,812 --> 02:15:55,379
COMPANIES PROTECT OUR USERS 

3595
02:15:55,379 --> 02:15:55,579
DATA.

3596
02:15:55,579 --> 02:15:57,682
>> I WANT TO BRING IN OUR PANEL 

3597
02:15:57,682 --> 02:16:01,887
NOW.

3598
02:16:10,228 --> 02:16:14,166
THANK YOU AGAIN.  

3599
02:16:14,166 --> 02:16:15,367
HOW WOULD YOU CHARACTERIZE 

3600
02:16:15,367 --> 02:16:16,267
TODAY'S QUESTIONING VERSUS 

3601
02:16:16,267 --> 02:16:18,103
YESTERDAY?

3602
02:16:18,103 --> 02:16:21,606
>> DEFINITELY IT IS A CHANGE, 

3603
02:16:21,606 --> 02:16:24,542
THE SENATE -- WE FELT LIKE A 

3604
02:16:24,542 --> 02:16:25,543
LOT OF THE SENATORS WERE NOT 

3605
02:16:25,543 --> 02:16:27,145
PREPARED.  

3606
02:16:27,145 --> 02:16:33,183
IT SEEMED LIKE MARK ZUCKERBERG 

3607
02:16:33,183 --> 02:16:34,119
WAS IN CONTROL BUT TODAY THINGS 

3608
02:16:34,119 --> 02:16:35,153
ARE DIFFERENT.

3609
02:16:35,153 --> 02:16:38,223
>> THE QUESTION WE JUST HEARD 

3610
02:16:38,223 --> 02:16:41,191
ABOUT DEVELOPERS VERSUS USERS 

3611
02:16:41,191 --> 02:16:41,825
IS A PERTINENT QUESTION BECAUSE 

3612
02:16:41,825 --> 02:16:42,761
IT DOES OFTEN SEEM

3613
02:16:42,761 --> 02:16:44,728
THE APP DEVELOPERS TAKE A BIG 

3614
02:16:44,728 --> 02:16:48,833
ROLE ON FACEBOOK.  CAN SOMEONE 

3615
02:16:48,833 --> 02:16:49,266
EXPLAIN WHAT IS THE 

3616
02:16:49,266 --> 02:16:50,501
RELATIONSHIP OF FACEBOOK TO 

3617
02:16:50,501 --> 02:16:53,204
THESE DEVELOPERS?

3618
02:16:53,204 --> 02:16:55,005
>> THE HISTORIC RELATIONSHIP IS 

3619
02:16:55,005 --> 02:16:58,309
THAT YOU CAN ACCESS A 

3620
02:16:58,309 --> 02:17:03,281
TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF DATA USING 

3621
02:17:03,281 --> 02:17:04,215
THE APPLICATION PROGRAMMING 

3622
02:17:04,215 --> 02:17:08,386
INTERFACE, EVERY MODULE IN 

3623
02:17:08,386 --> 02:17:08,886
FACEBOOK, WHETHER IT IS 

3624
02:17:08,886 --> 02:17:12,991
MESSENGER, NEWS FEED EVENTS, 

3625
02:17:12,991 --> 02:17:14,225
HAS ONE OF THESE APPLICATION 

3626
02:17:14,225 --> 02:17:16,193
PROGRAM INTERFACE.  

3627
02:17:16,193 --> 02:17:16,826
THEY PROVIDE DATA TO DIFFERENT 

3628
02:17:16,826 --> 02:17:19,029
COMPONENTS OF FACEBOOK.  IT IS 

3629
02:17:19,029 --> 02:17:21,233
REAL EASY TO LIFT DATA USING 

3630
02:17:21,233 --> 02:17:24,568
THOSE APIS AND PUT THAT INTO 

3631
02:17:24,568 --> 02:17:33,178
YOUR OWN DATABASE.

3632
02:17:33,178 --> 02:17:34,412
>> DOES FACEBOOK MAKE MONEY OFF 

3633
02:17:34,412 --> 02:17:38,116
OF THESE APPS?  

3634
02:17:38,116 --> 02:17:38,749
WHAT IS THE ADVANTAGE TO HAVING 

3635
02:17:38,749 --> 02:17:40,084
ALL OF THESE APPS ON FACEBOOK?

3636
02:17:40,084 --> 02:17:43,888
>> IT REALLY FUELED THE GROWTH 

3637
02:17:43,888 --> 02:17:48,593
OF THE PLATFORM BECAUSE 

3638
02:17:48,593 --> 02:17:49,727
MARKETERS FOR THE FIRST TIME 

3639
02:17:49,727 --> 02:17:50,295
HAD ACCESS TO ALL KINDS OF 

3640
02:17:50,295 --> 02:17:51,263
DEMOGRAPHICS, INFORMATION, THEY 

3641
02:17:51,263 --> 02:17:52,597
WANTED TO BUILD THE PRODUCTS 

3642
02:17:52,597 --> 02:18:02,107
BASED OFF THE FACEBOOK API.  

3643
02:18:02,107 --> 02:18:02,740
THEY WERE ABLE TO GET IN FRONT 

3644
02:18:02,740 --> 02:18:03,308
-- THEY WEREN'T ABLE TO GET 

3645
02:18:03,308 --> 02:18:03,875
THIS MUCH INFORMATION FROM 

3646
02:18:03,875 --> 02:18:04,209
ANYONE ELSE.  

3647
02:18:04,209 --> 02:18:05,510
I THINK IT WAS THAT

3648
02:18:05,510 --> 02:18:09,848
RELATIONSHIP THAT REALLY FUELED 

3649
02:18:09,848 --> 02:18:10,248
FACEBOOK'S GROWTH.

3650
02:18:10,248 --> 02:18:10,815
>> GOING FORWARD WILL THE 

3651
02:18:10,815 --> 02:18:11,483
RELATIONSHIP WITH THE APPS HAVE 

3652
02:18:11,483 --> 02:18:14,252
TO CHANGE? 

3653
02:18:14,252 --> 02:18:14,818
>> IT SEEMS LIKE THERE IS A 

3654
02:18:14,818 --> 02:18:15,153
PROBLEM HERE. 

3655
02:18:15,153 --> 02:18:16,754
THEY ARE TAKING THE STEPS IN 

3656
02:18:16,754 --> 02:18:21,026
THE RIGHT DIRECTION BUT, THEY 

3657
02:18:21,026 --> 02:18:21,659
STILL HAVE THESE RELATIONSHIPS 

3658
02:18:21,659 --> 02:18:24,062
WITH APP DEVELOPERS.  

3659
02:18:24,062 --> 02:18:26,164
THEY ARE STILL A IMPORTANT PART 

3660
02:18:26,164 --> 02:18:34,672
OF FACEBOOK'S BUSINESS MODEL.

3661
02:18:34,672 --> 02:18:38,209
>> IS ARE GOING TO BE 

3662
02:18:38,209 --> 02:18:41,413
REGULATION?  

3663
02:18:41,413 --> 02:18:42,013
MARK ZUCKERBERG APPEARS TO BE 

3664
02:18:42,013 --> 02:18:42,513
OPEN TO IT.  

3665
02:18:42,513 --> 02:18:46,217
DO YOU THINK THAT HE WANTS TO 

3666
02:18:46,217 --> 02:18:49,486
HAVE CONGRESS ALLOW HIM TO SELF 

3667
02:18:49,486 --> 02:18:49,753
REGULATE?

3668
02:18:49,753 --> 02:18:52,022
>> ABSOLUTELY. 

3669
02:18:52,022 --> 02:18:53,090
IT WOULD BE THE BEST SOLUTION 

3670
02:18:53,090 --> 02:18:54,391
NOT JUST FOR MR. ZUCKERBERG BUT 

3671
02:18:54,391 --> 02:18:57,062
FOR ALL SILICON VALLEY 

3672
02:18:57,062 --> 02:18:57,896
COMPANIES.  

3673
02:18:57,896 --> 02:19:00,298
IT IS NOT REALISTIC.  WE DO 

3674
02:19:00,298 --> 02:19:02,267
KNOW THAT MR. ZUCKERBERG HAS 

3675
02:19:02,267 --> 02:19:06,103
EXPRESSED A DESIRE FOR SELF 

3676
02:19:06,103 --> 02:19:09,974
REGULATION

3677
02:19:09,974 --> 02:19:10,608
AND FOR GOVERNMENT REGULATION.  

3678
02:19:10,608 --> 02:19:11,242
AT THE SAME TIME HE HAS HIS OWN 

3679
02:19:11,242 --> 02:19:12,943
LOBBYIST IN WASHINGTON WORKING 

3680
02:19:12,943 --> 02:19:18,516
TO WORK ON THE HONEST ADS ACT.  

3681
02:19:18,516 --> 02:19:23,754
SO THEY CAN'T HAVE IT BOTH WAYS.

3682
02:19:23,754 --> 02:19:25,522
>> ONE THING I FEEL HAS NOT 

3683
02:19:25,522 --> 02:19:28,192
BEEN ADDRESSED, IS WHAT 

3684
02:19:28,192 --> 02:19:28,860
ACTUALLY HAPPENS TO THIS DATA 

3685
02:19:28,860 --> 02:19:30,962
ONCE IT IS OUT THERE.  

3686
02:19:30,962 --> 02:19:34,165
IT HAS ALL BEEN SOLD TO 

3687
02:19:34,165 --> 02:19:34,764
CAMBRIDGE ANALYTICA, WHERE IS 

3688
02:19:34,764 --> 02:19:35,299
IT NOW?  

3689
02:19:35,299 --> 02:19:39,270
HE HAS NOT TALKED ABOUT THAT.

3690
02:19:39,270 --> 02:19:41,539
>> AGAIN, THE API, SINCE THE 

3691
02:19:41,539 --> 02:19:43,540
BEGINNING WAS VERY OPEN. 

3692
02:19:43,540 --> 02:19:47,378
ONCE A DAY THERE WAS ON THE 

3693
02:19:47,378 --> 02:19:49,981
APPS THEY WERE ABLE TO DOWNLOAD 

3694
02:19:49,981 --> 02:19:51,516
IT, ONCE DATA IS OUTSIDE OF THE 

3695
02:19:51,516 --> 02:19:56,421
DOOR IT IS OUT.

3696
02:19:56,421 --> 02:19:57,588
>> NOW HE IS SAYING THERE ARE 

3697
02:19:57,588 --> 02:19:58,222
TENS OF THOUSANDS OF APPS THEY 

3698
02:19:58,222 --> 02:19:58,622
ARE LOOKING AT.  

3699
02:19:58,622 --> 02:20:02,227
SO -- IT SEEMS LIKE THE TIP OF 

3700
02:20:02,227 --> 02:20:03,761
THE ICEBERG.

3701
02:20:03,761 --> 02:20:04,796
>> WHAT REALLY HAS BEEN 

3702
02:20:04,796 --> 02:20:06,264
HIGHLIGHTED IS FACEBOOK IS NOT 

3703
02:20:06,264 --> 02:20:09,834
DOING ANY WORK TO DO AN AUDIT.  

3704
02:20:09,834 --> 02:20:10,434
ARE YOU ACTUALLY CONTROLLING 

3705
02:20:10,434 --> 02:20:12,170
THE DATA?  

3706
02:20:12,170 --> 02:20:13,505
ARE YOU DOING WHAT YOU SAID 

3707
02:20:13,505 --> 02:20:14,139
WITH IT?  

3708
02:20:14,139 --> 02:20:15,240
AGAIN, THE WORK OF JOURNALISTS 

3709
02:20:15,240 --> 02:20:19,410
IN THE UK REALLY HIGHLIGHTED 

3710
02:20:19,410 --> 02:20:20,945
THIS WOULD CAMBRIDGE ANALYTICA.

3711
02:20:20,945 --> 02:20:24,349
>> YOU SAW THAT -- FACEBOOK 

3712
02:20:24,349 --> 02:20:28,787
TOOK CAMBRIDGE ANALYTICA AT AT 

3713
02:20:28,787 --> 02:20:29,387
ITS WORD THAT IT DELETED ITS 

3714
02:20:29,387 --> 02:20:29,988
INFORMATION WHEN ACTUALLY IT 

3715
02:20:29,988 --> 02:20:30,221
DIDN'T.

3716
02:20:30,221 --> 02:20:34,592
>> WE HEARD MARK ZUCKERBERG SAY 

3717
02:20:34,592 --> 02:20:35,726
THEY TOOK THE INFORMATION THAT 

3718
02:20:35,726 --> 02:20:36,360
HE HAD GATHERED ON HIS APP, 

3719
02:20:36,360 --> 02:20:40,098
WHICH HE WAS ALLOWED TO DO, 

3720
02:20:40,098 --> 02:20:42,167
THEN HE SOLD IT TO CAMBRIDGE 

3721
02:20:42,167 --> 02:20:42,800
ANALYTIA WHICH MARK ZUCKERBERG 

3722
02:20:42,800 --> 02:20:44,535
SAYS HE WAS NOT ALLOWED TO DO. 

3723
02:20:44,535 --> 02:20:46,137
THAT VIOLATED THE AGREEMENT 

3724
02:20:46,137 --> 02:20:49,007
THEY HAD.  

3725
02:20:49,007 --> 02:20:50,208
SO IS FACEBOOK GOING TO SUE 

3726
02:20:50,208 --> 02:20:53,177
CROGHAN?

3727
02:20:53,177 --> 02:20:54,411
>> HE WAS ASKED THAT QUESTION.  

3728
02:20:54,411 --> 02:20:57,015
HE DID NOT REALLY SAY -- HE 

3729
02:20:57,015 --> 02:20:57,882
WOULD NOT COMMIT EITHER WAY.  

3730
02:20:57,882 --> 02:21:00,418
I THINK IT DOES SPEAK TO THE 

3731
02:21:00,418 --> 02:21:06,491
PRIORITIES ON THE MIND OF MARK 

3732
02:21:06,491 --> 02:21:07,258
ZUCKERBERG.  

3733
02:21:07,258 --> 02:21:07,859
GOING AFTER THAT, HAVING THIS 

3734
02:21:07,859 --> 02:21:08,860
BLOWUP EVEN FURTHER IS

3735
02:21:08,860 --> 02:21:15,867
NOT WHAT HE WANTS.

3736
02:21:15,867 --> 02:21:17,101
>> THE PLATFORM WAS DESIGNED IN 

3737
02:21:17,101 --> 02:21:17,735
SUCH A WAY SO IT WOULD BE EASY 

3738
02:21:17,735 --> 02:21:18,303
TO EXTRACT DATA SO THAT NOT 

3739
02:21:18,303 --> 02:21:18,970
JUST FACEBOOK WOULD GROW BUT WE 

3740
02:21:18,970 --> 02:21:23,808
REMEMBER APPS -- SO THAT 

3741
02:21:23,808 --> 02:21:26,044
DEVELOPERS COULD GROW USING 

3742
02:21:26,044 --> 02:21:27,478
FACEBOOK DATA AS WELL.  

3743
02:21:27,478 --> 02:21:33,618
FOR THEM TO SAY THEY TOLD US 

3744
02:21:33,618 --> 02:21:34,252
THEY DELETED IT, NO, THE ENTIRE 

3745
02:21:34,252 --> 02:21:34,852
SYSTEM WAS DESIGNED FOR THIS 

3746
02:21:34,852 --> 02:21:37,355
TYPE OF SCALE.

3747
02:21:37,355 --> 02:21:42,226
>> WHICH RELATIONSHIP IS MORE 

3748
02:21:42,226 --> 02:21:43,595
IMPORTANT?  

3749
02:21:43,595 --> 02:21:44,095
IT IS A LITTLE BIT OF A 

3750
02:21:44,095 --> 02:21:44,562
CONFLICT OF INTEREST. 

3751
02:21:44,562 --> 02:21:47,532
>> IT IS CLEAR GROWTH OF THE 

3752
02:21:47,532 --> 02:21:50,268
PLATFORM WAS PARAMOUNT IN HIS 

3753
02:21:50,268 --> 02:21:55,640
MIND.  

3754
02:21:55,640 --> 02:21:56,273
PRIVACY HAS BECOME A LIVE DEAL 

3755
02:21:56,273 --> 02:21:56,874
BECAUSE IT HAS BECOME PUBLIC 

3756
02:21:56,874 --> 02:21:57,475
BUT IT HAS ALWAYS BEEN ABOUT 

3757
02:21:57,475 --> 02:21:58,342
THE GROWTH. 

3758
02:21:58,342 --> 02:22:01,079
>> HE DID NOT REALLY FULLY 

3759
02:22:01,079 --> 02:22:02,213
COMMUNICATE ABOUT THE FTC 

3760
02:22:02,213 --> 02:22:03,815
ENFORCEMENT.  

3761
02:22:03,815 --> 02:22:04,849
IT SEEMS LIKE HE IS FOCUSED ON 

3762
02:22:04,849 --> 02:22:06,084
THE GROWTH, HE HAS NOT REALLY 

3763
02:22:06,084 --> 02:22:08,285
LOOK AT ALL THE RISKS AND 

3764
02:22:08,285 --> 02:22:11,021
ENFORCEMENT, HE NEEDS TO PAY 

3765
02:22:11,021 --> 02:22:15,360
ATTENTION TO EVERYTHING.

3766
02:22:15,360 --> 02:22:16,493
>> DO YOU THINK THAT WAS 

3767
02:22:16,493 --> 02:22:17,094
GENUINE WHEN HE DID NOT KNOW 

3768
02:22:17,094 --> 02:22:22,166
ABOUT THESE CASES?

3769
02:22:22,166 --> 02:22:22,633
>> HE HAS A STATUTORY 

3770
02:22:22,633 --> 02:22:26,137
REQUIREMENT TO TELL THE TRUTH.

3771
02:22:26,137 --> 02:22:30,141
>> SO, HE DID NOT KNOW ABOUT 

3772
02:22:30,141 --> 02:22:30,775
THESE CASES?

3773
02:22:30,775 --> 02:22:31,975
>> I ALSO DON'T THINK HE PAYS 

3774
02:22:31,975 --> 02:22:33,978
THAT MUCH ATTENTION TO IT.

3775
02:22:33,978 --> 02:22:35,980
>> IT IS NOT ON HIS PRIORITY 

3776
02:22:35,980 --> 02:22:36,180
LIST.

3777
02:22:36,180 --> 02:22:38,148
>> LOOK AT WHERE WE ARE TODAY.  

3778
02:22:38,148 --> 02:22:40,385
LOOK AT HOW THE COMPANY IS RUN.

3779
02:22:40,385 --> 02:22:42,787
>> ONE CONGRESSWOMAN POINTED 

3780
02:22:42,787 --> 02:22:47,558
THAT OUT TODAY.  SHE SUGGESTED 

3781
02:22:47,558 --> 02:22:48,192
FINANCIAL PENALTIES WOULD MAKE 

3782
02:22:48,192 --> 02:22:49,560
IT MORE OF A PRIORITY.  

3783
02:22:49,560 --> 02:22:50,294
DO YOU THINK THAT IS WHAT HAS 

3784
02:22:50,294 --> 02:22:53,498
TO HAPPEN?

3785
02:22:53,498 --> 02:22:57,301
>> DEFINITELY THE FTC HAS HAD 

3786
02:22:57,301 --> 02:22:58,069
CERTAIN TOOLS TO ENFORCE 

3787
02:22:58,069 --> 02:23:00,838
COMPANIES TO FOLLOW THE RULES.  

3788
02:23:00,838 --> 02:23:06,010
SO, IT IS UNCLEAR IF THERE WERE 

3789
02:23:06,010 --> 02:23:06,611
ANY FINANCIAL PENALTIES FROM 

3790
02:23:06,611 --> 02:23:10,214
THE FTC SO, I THINK, YEAH, 

3791
02:23:10,214 --> 02:23:13,985
ABSOLUTELY HAVING A FINANCIAL 

3792
02:23:13,985 --> 02:23:14,252
PENALTY. 

3793
02:23:14,252 --> 02:23:14,886
THAT SAID, THIS COMPANY MAKES 

3794
02:23:14,886 --> 02:23:19,390
IT BILLIONS OF DOLLARS.

3795
02:23:19,390 --> 02:23:20,557
>> THEY COULD THINK OF THESE AS 

3796
02:23:20,557 --> 02:23:22,727
INCENTIVES.

3797
02:23:22,727 --> 02:23:26,264
>> TIED TO THEIR BONUSES. 

3798
02:23:26,264 --> 02:23:27,598
>> MARK ZUCKERBERG IS 

3799
02:23:27,598 --> 02:23:28,031
INCREDIBLY WEALTHY. 

3800
02:23:28,031 --> 02:23:33,438
ONE BILLION-DOLLAR ENFORCEMENT 

3801
02:23:33,438 --> 02:23:34,038
ACTION, I DON'T EVEN THINK HE 

3802
02:23:34,038 --> 02:23:34,605
PAYS ATTENTION TO SOMETHING 

3803
02:23:34,605 --> 02:23:39,377
LIKE THAT.

3804
02:23:39,377 --> 02:23:40,611
>> WE ARE GOING TO GO BACK IN 

3805
02:23:40,611 --> 02:23:41,512
AND LISTEN.  

3806
02:23:41,512 --> 02:23:43,615
THANK YOU SO MUCH.  

3807
02:23:43,615 --> 02:23:44,248
DON'T GO AWAY WE ARE GOING TO 

3808
02:23:44,248 --> 02:23:48,619
RESUME THE HEARING.

3809
02:23:48,619 --> 02:23:52,757
>> THE GENTLEMAN TIME HAS 

3810
02:23:52,757 --> 02:23:53,524
EXPIRED. 

3811

3812
02:23:55,860 --> 02:23:58,362
EXPIRED.  

3813

WE WILL HAVE A VOTE AT 1:40 WE 

3814
02:24:01,833 --> 02:24:02,466
WILL CONTINUE THE HEARING AFTER 

3815
02:24:02,466 --> 02:24:05,136
A BRIEF BREAK.  

3816
02:24:05,136 --> 02:24:07,238
LET'S GO NOW TO THE DOCTOR.

3817
02:24:07,238 --> 02:24:09,273
>> THANK YOU.  

3818
02:24:09,273 --> 02:24:13,044
THERE ARE PLENTY OF EXAMPLES, 

3819
02:24:13,044 --> 02:24:13,644
INCLUDING FROM FAMILY MEMBERS 

3820
02:24:13,644 --> 02:24:15,680
OF MINE WHERE PEOPLE WILL BE

3821
02:24:15,680 --> 02:24:16,948
VERBALLY DISCUSSING ITEMS NEVER 

3822
02:24:16,948 --> 02:24:22,120
HAVING BEEN ON THE INTERNET AT 

3823
02:24:22,120 --> 02:24:27,591
THE TIME, THEN THE NEXT TIME 

3824
02:24:27,591 --> 02:24:28,192
THEY GET ON FACEBOOK OR OTHER 

3825
02:24:28,192 --> 02:24:28,759
ONLINE APPS, ADS FOR THINGS 

3826
02:24:28,759 --> 02:24:29,260
THAT THEY WERE VERBALLY 

3827
02:24:29,260 --> 02:24:29,894
DISCUSSING WITH EACH OTHER WILL 

3828
02:24:29,894 --> 02:24:30,895
SHOW UP.

3829
02:24:30,895 --> 02:24:32,629
I KNOW YOU SAID IN THE SENATE 

3830
02:24:32,629 --> 02:24:34,966
THAT FACEBOOK DOES NOT LISTEN 

3831
02:24:34,966 --> 02:24:38,169
SPECIFICALLY TO WHAT PEOPLE ARE 

3832
02:24:38,169 --> 02:24:40,338
SAYING THROUGH

3833
02:24:40,338 --> 02:24:42,140
THEIR PHONE, WHETHER THAT IS A 

3834
02:24:42,140 --> 02:24:44,609
GOOGLE PHONE OR IN APPLE.  

3835
02:24:44,609 --> 02:24:46,244
HOWEVER THE OTHER DAY MY MOTHER-

3836
02:24:46,244 --> 02:24:52,416
IN-LAW WAS DISCUSSING HER 

3837
02:24:52,416 --> 02:24:53,016
BROTHER WHO HAD BEEN DECEASED 

3838
02:24:53,016 --> 02:24:53,550
FOR TEN YEARS, LATER THAT 

3839
02:24:53,550 --> 02:24:54,485
EVENING ON HER FACBOOK SITE 

3840
02:24:54,485 --> 02:24:59,623
SHE HAD IT SET TO MUSIC, A 

3841
02:24:59,623 --> 02:25:02,126
PICTURE COLLAGE THAT CAME UP ON 

3842
02:25:02,126 --> 02:25:04,128
FACEBOOK SPECIFICALLY TO HER 

3843
02:25:04,128 --> 02:25:05,062
BROTHER.  

3844
02:25:05,062 --> 02:25:08,733
SO, IF YOU ARE NOT LISTENING TO 

3845
02:25:08,733 --> 02:25:13,504
US ON THE PHONE, WHO IS?  

3846
02:25:13,504 --> 02:25:15,606
DO YOU HAVE SPECIFIC CONTRACTS 

3847
02:25:15,606 --> 02:25:17,041
WITH THESE COMPANIES THAT WILL 

3848
02:25:17,041 --> 02:25:17,274
PROVIDE

3849
02:25:17,274 --> 02:25:21,813
DATA THAT IS BEING ACQUIRED 

3850
02:25:21,813 --> 02:25:24,816
VERBALLY THROUGH OUR PHONES OR 

3851
02:25:24,816 --> 02:25:26,851
NOW THROUGH THINGS LIKE ALEXA 

3852
02:25:26,851 --> 02:25:28,418
OR OTHER PRODUCTS?

3853
02:25:28,418 --> 02:25:32,690
>> CONGRESSMAN WE ARE NOT 

3854
02:25:32,690 --> 02:25:34,425
COLLECTING ANY INFORMATION 

3855
02:25:34,425 --> 02:25:37,895
VERBALLY.  

3856
02:25:37,895 --> 02:25:38,528
THE ONLY TIME WE MIGHT USE THE 

3857
02:25:38,528 --> 02:25:39,129
MICROPHONE IS WHEN YOU ARE 

3858
02:25:39,129 --> 02:25:41,432
RECORDING A VIDEO OR DOING 

3859
02:25:41,432 --> 02:25:42,066
SOMETHING WHERE YOU ARE TRYING 

3860
02:25:42,066 --> 02:25:42,600
TO RECORD AUDIO.  

3861
02:25:42,600 --> 02:25:45,136
BUT WE DON'T HAVE

3862
02:25:45,136 --> 02:25:45,903
ANYTHING THAT IS TRYING TO 

3863
02:25:45,903 --> 02:25:47,538
LISTEN TO WHAT IS GOING ON.

3864
02:25:47,538 --> 02:25:50,607
>> LIKE I SAID, MY SON WHO 

3865
02:25:50,607 --> 02:25:54,245
LIVES IN CHICAGO, HE AND HIS 

3866
02:25:54,245 --> 02:25:59,216
FRIENDS ARE TALKING ABOUT A 

3867
02:25:59,216 --> 02:26:00,351
CERTAIN TYPE OF SUIT BECAUSE 

3868
02:26:00,351 --> 02:26:00,918
THEY ARE BUSINESS GUYS, THE 

3869
02:26:00,918 --> 02:26:02,286
NEXT DAY THEY HAD A BUNCH OF ADS

3870
02:26:02,286 --> 02:26:07,825
ABOUT BUSINESS SUITS.  

3871
02:26:07,825 --> 02:26:08,358
IT IS OBVIOUS SOMEONE IS 

3872
02:26:08,358 --> 02:26:12,329
LISTENING TO THE AUDIO ON OUR 

3873
02:26:12,329 --> 02:26:13,130
PHONES.  

3874
02:26:13,130 --> 02:26:14,866
I SEE THAT AS A BIG ISSUE.  

3875
02:26:14,866 --> 02:26:21,505
YOU MAY NOT BE BUT, FOR EXAMPLE 

3876
02:26:21,505 --> 02:26:22,072
IF YOU ARE IN YOUR DOCTOR'S 

3877
02:26:22,072 --> 02:26:24,709
OFFICE, IN A BOARD ROOM, OR 

3878
02:26:24,709 --> 02:26:25,543
EVEN PERSONAL AREAS OF YOUR 

3879
02:26:25,543 --> 02:26:30,148
HOME, THAT IS POTENTIALLY AN 

3880
02:26:30,148 --> 02:26:31,616
ISSUE.  

3881
02:26:31,616 --> 02:26:34,118
I AM SKEPTICAL THAT SOMEONE 

3882
02:26:34,118 --> 02:26:35,453
ISN'T LISTENING.  

3883
02:26:35,453 --> 02:26:36,053
I SEE THIS AS AN INDUSTRYWIDE 

3884
02:26:36,053 --> 02:26:37,788
ISSUE THAT YOU COULD

3885
02:26:37,788 --> 02:26:39,757
POTENTIALLY HELP TO ADDRESS.  

3886
02:26:39,757 --> 02:26:43,361
THE FINAL THING, WHEN YOU HAVE 

3887
02:26:43,361 --> 02:26:50,767
AN EXECUTIVE SESSION AND YOU 

3888
02:26:50,767 --> 02:26:51,368
HAVE DECISIONS TO BE MADE, DO 

3889
02:26:51,368 --> 02:26:51,935
YOU ALLOW THE PEOPLE IN THE 

3890
02:26:51,935 --> 02:26:52,837
ROOM TO HAVE THEIR PHONES ON 

3891
02:26:52,837 --> 02:26:53,037
THEM?

3892
02:26:53,037 --> 02:26:58,109
>> CONGRESSMAN, WE DO.  

3893
02:26:58,109 --> 02:27:02,179
AGAIN, I AM NOT FAMILIAR WITH 

3894
02:27:02,179 --> 02:27:05,116
FACEBOOK DOESN'T DO THIS, I AM 

3895
02:27:05,116 --> 02:27:06,884
NOT FAMILIAR WITH ANY

3896
02:27:06,884 --> 02:27:11,889
COMPANIES THAT DO EITHER.  

3897
02:27:11,889 --> 02:27:12,489
MY UNDERSTANDING IS A LOT OF 

3898
02:27:12,489 --> 02:27:13,056
THESE CASES YOU ARE TALKING 

3899
02:27:13,056 --> 02:27:16,427
ABOUT ARE A COINCIDENCE OR 

3900
02:27:16,427 --> 02:27:17,060
SOMEONE MIGHT BE TALKING ABOUT 

3901
02:27:17,060 --> 02:27:18,229
SOMETHING BUT THEY ALSO GO TO A 

3902
02:27:18,229 --> 02:27:19,964
WEBSITE ON FACEBOOK BECAUSE 

3903
02:27:19,964 --> 02:27:23,835
THEY WERE TALKING ABOUT IT.  

3904
02:27:23,835 --> 02:27:24,468
THEN MAYBE THEY WILL SEE THE AD 

3905
02:27:24,468 --> 02:27:25,769
BECAUSE OF THAT.

3906
02:27:25,769 --> 02:27:32,076
>> IF THAT IS THE CASE -- I 

3907
02:27:32,076 --> 02:27:33,243
KNOW FOR CONVENIENCE COMPANIES 

3908
02:27:33,243 --> 02:27:40,518
HAVE DEVELOPED THINGS, BUT, IT 

3909
02:27:40,518 --> 02:27:42,119
JUST SEEMS TO ME

3910
02:27:42,119 --> 02:27:46,257
THAT THE POINT OF THOSE 

3911
02:27:46,257 --> 02:27:46,857
PRODUCTS IS NOT JUST FOR YOUR 

3912
02:27:46,857 --> 02:27:47,725
OWN CONVENIENCE BUT WHEN YOU 

3913
02:27:47,725 --> 02:27:48,692
ARE VERBALLY TALKING ABOUT

3914
02:27:48,692 --> 02:27:53,263

I WOULD IMPLORE THE INDUSTRY TO

02:31:08,125 --> 02:31:08,792
UNDERSTANDING THAT IF YOU DIVE 

3993
02:31:08,792 --> 02:31:10,127
INTO THE DETAILS OF YOUR 

3994
02:31:10,127 --> 02:31:12,662
PLATFORM USERS MIGHT BE ABLE TO 

3995
02:31:12,662 --> 02:31:16,333
SHUT THAT OFF.  

3996
02:31:16,333 --> 02:31:16,966
BUT THE CHALLENGE IS THERE IS A 

3997
02:31:16,966 --> 02:31:17,634
LOT OF INFORMATION THAT IS 

3998
02:31:17,634 --> 02:31:18,402
GENERATED THAT PEOPLE DON'T 

3999
02:31:18,402 --> 02:31:21,105
THINK THEY ARE GENERATING.

4000
02:31:21,105 --> 02:31:25,308
>> MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT THE 

4001
02:31:25,308 --> 02:31:27,544
TARGETING OPTIONS THAT ARE 

4002
02:31:27,544 --> 02:31:30,147
AVAILABLE FOR ADVERTISERS ARE 

4003
02:31:30,147 --> 02:31:31,182
THINGS THAT ARE BASED ON WHAT 

4004
02:31:31,182 --> 02:31:31,982
PEOPLE SHARE.  

4005
02:31:31,982 --> 02:31:36,587
ONCE IN ADVERTISER TO THIS IS 

4006
02:31:36,587 --> 02:31:37,087
HOW THEY WANT TO TARGET 

4007
02:31:37,087 --> 02:31:37,688
SOMETHING FACEBOOK ALSO DOES 

4008
02:31:37,688 --> 02:31:40,991
ITS OWN WORK TO HELP DETERMINE 

4009
02:31:40,991 --> 02:31:41,591
WHICH ADS WILL BE INTERESTING 

4010
02:31:41,591 --> 02:31:42,426
TO WHICH PEOPLE.  

4011
02:31:42,426 --> 02:31:46,263
SO WE MAY USE BEHAVIORS OF WHAT 

4012
02:31:46,263 --> 02:31:50,267
YOU HAVE SHOWN YOU ARE 

4013
02:31:50,267 --> 02:31:51,769
THE SYSTEMS MORE RELEVANT TO 

4014
02:31:51,769 --> 02:31:52,470
YOU.  

4015
02:31:52,470 --> 02:31:53,470
BUT THAT IS A LITTLE DIFFERENT 

4016
02:31:53,470 --> 02:31:55,739
THAN GIVING THAT AS AN OPTION 

4017
02:31:55,739 --> 02:31:57,107
TO AN ADVERTISER.

4018
02:31:57,107 --> 02:32:01,611
>> I THINK ONE OF THE PROBLEMS 

4019
02:32:01,611 --> 02:32:03,013
IS I DON'T UNDERSTAND HOW USES 

4020
02:32:03,013 --> 02:32:03,847
OWN THAT DATA.  

4021
02:32:03,847 --> 02:32:08,552
ALSO, YOU FOCUSED YOUR 

4022
02:32:08,552 --> 02:32:09,119
TESTIMONY ON THE INDIVIDUAL 

4023
02:32:09,119 --> 02:32:10,254
PRIVACY ASPECT THAT WE HAVE NOT 

4024
02:32:10,254 --> 02:32:14,258
TALKED ABOUT THE SOCIETAL 

4025
02:32:14,258 --> 02:32:17,328
IMPLICATION.  

4026
02:32:17,328 --> 02:32:17,928
WHILE I APPLAUD SOME OF YOUR 

4027
02:32:17,928 --> 02:32:18,562
REFORMS THE ISSUE HERE IS THAT 

4028
02:32:18,562 --> 02:32:24,167
YOUR PLATFORM HAS BECOME A MIX 

4029
02:32:24,167 --> 02:32:26,036
OF NEWS, ENTERTAINMENT, SOCIAL 

4030
02:32:26,036 --> 02:32:26,236
MEDIA,

4031
02:32:26,236 --> 02:32:30,040
THAT IS UP FOR MANIPULATION.  

4032
02:32:30,040 --> 02:32:33,377
WE HAVE SEEN THAT.  

4033
02:32:33,377 --> 02:32:33,977
IF THE CHANGES TO INDIVIDUAL 

4034
02:32:33,977 --> 02:32:37,280
PRIVACY AREN'T SUFFICIENT -- 

4035
02:32:37,280 --> 02:32:44,955
>> TIME IS EXPIRED.  

4036
02:32:44,955 --> 02:32:46,157
CHAIR RECOGNIZES THE GENTLEMAN 

4037
02:32:46,157 --> 02:32:46,890
FROM TEXAS.

4038
02:32:46,890 --> 02:32:53,597
>> THE ACTIVITIES OF FACEBOOK 

4039
02:32:53,597 --> 02:32:55,766
AND OTHER COMPANIES SHOULD NOT 

4040
02:32:55,766 --> 02:32:56,400
SURPRISE US.  

4041
02:32:56,400 --> 02:32:57,901
WE HAVE SEEN IT BEFORE.  

4042
02:32:57,901 --> 02:33:06,009
WE SAW A MONOPOLY IN THE LATE 

4043
02:33:06,009 --> 02:33:06,577
18 HUNDREDS, WE SAW A LARGE 

4044
02:33:06,577 --> 02:33:07,211
COMPANY BECOME A NEAR MONOPOLY 

4045
02:33:07,211 --> 02:33:11,448
IN THE 60s, JUST AS FACEBOOK

4046
02:33:11,448 --> 02:33:12,816
-- THESE COMPANIES WERE FOUNDED 

4047
02:33:12,816 --> 02:33:16,020
BY BRIGHT PEOPLE, THEIR 

4048
02:33:16,020 --> 02:33:20,191
COMPANIES GREW, EVENTUALLY THEY 

4049
02:33:20,191 --> 02:33:22,492
SOMETIMES BECAME DETACHED FROM 

4050
02:33:22,492 --> 02:33:23,694
EVERYDAY AMERICANS.  

4051
02:33:23,694 --> 02:33:24,294
WHAT HAPPENED IS POLICYMAKERS 

4052
02:33:24,294 --> 02:33:25,996
HAD TO STEP IN AND WE 

4053
02:33:25,996 --> 02:33:27,631
ESTABLISHED THE BALANCE

4054
02:33:27,631 --> 02:33:30,200
BETWEEN THOSE PEOPLE AND 

4055
02:33:30,200 --> 02:33:32,002
EVERYDAY AMERICANS.  

4056
02:33:32,002 --> 02:33:33,103
YOU DID NOT INTEND FOR THIS TO 

4057
02:33:33,103 --> 02:33:35,572
HAPPEN.  I 

4058
02:33:35,572 --> 02:33:38,142
APPRECIATE THAT YOU HAVE 

4059
02:33:38,142 --> 02:33:40,110
APOLOGIZED FOR IT.  

4060
02:33:40,110 --> 02:33:40,710
IT APPEARS YOU ARE TRYING TO 

4061
02:33:40,710 --> 02:33:47,217
ADDRESS THE SITUATION.  JUST AS 

4062
02:33:47,217 --> 02:33:47,817
WE ADDRESSED THOSE MONOPOLIES 

4063
02:33:47,817 --> 02:33:48,418
IN THE PAST WE ARE FACED WITH 

4064
02:33:48,418 --> 02:33:51,355
THAT SITUATION TODAY.  WE NEED 

4065
02:33:51,355 --> 02:33:54,158
-- THIS GOES BEYOND FACEBOOK.  

4066
02:33:54,158 --> 02:33:57,828
THIS HAS TO DO WITH THE SOCIAL 

4067
02:33:57,828 --> 02:34:03,434
MEDIA ORGANIZATIONS, BACK TO 

4068
02:34:03,434 --> 02:34:04,201
FACEBOOK WE HEARD EXAMPLES 

4069
02:34:04,201 --> 02:34:07,037
YESTERDAY DURING THE HEARING, 

4070
02:34:07,037 --> 02:34:11,408
ABOUT IDEOLOGICAL BIAS AMONG 

4071
02:34:11,408 --> 02:34:15,746
USERS OF FACEBOOK AND MY TEXAS 

4072
02:34:15,746 --> 02:34:18,215
DISTRICT I HAD A RETIRED SCHOOL 

4073
02:34:18,215 --> 02:34:19,282
TEACHER WHOSE POSTINGS WERE 

4074
02:34:19,282 --> 02:34:21,952
BANNED OR STOPPED, THE GOOD 

4075
02:34:21,952 --> 02:34:25,422
NEWS IS I WAS ABLE TO WORK WITH 

4076
02:34:25,422 --> 02:34:26,055
FACEBOOK'S PERSONNEL TO GET HER 

4077
02:34:26,055 --> 02:34:26,724
REINSTATED.  

4078
02:34:26,724 --> 02:34:29,727
THAT SAID THEY STILL SEEM TO BE 

4079
02:34:29,727 --> 02:34:33,464
TRYING TO STOP HER POSTINGS.  

4080
02:34:33,464 --> 02:34:34,031
ANYTHING YOU CAN DO IN THAT 

4081
02:34:34,031 --> 02:34:35,298
REGARD TO FIX THAT BIAS WILL GO 

4082
02:34:35,298 --> 02:34:40,437
A LONG WAY.  

4083
02:34:40,437 --> 02:34:41,138
I WANT TO GO IN A DIFFERENT 

4084
02:34:41,138 --> 02:34:41,738
DIRECTION AND TALK ABOUT THE 

4085
02:34:41,738 --> 02:34:41,972
FUTURE. 

4086
02:34:41,972 --> 02:34:43,006
CONGRESS NEEDS TO CONSIDER 

4087
02:34:43,006 --> 02:34:44,407
POLICY RESPONSES IN I WANT TO 

4088
02:34:44,407 --> 02:34:47,911
CALL THIS POLICY RESPONSE 

4089
02:34:47,911 --> 02:34:50,781
PRIVACY 2.0.  

4090
02:34:50,781 --> 02:34:52,283
I THINK THE TECHNOLOGY 

4091
02:34:52,283 --> 02:34:53,951
COMPANIES SHOULD BE IDEOLOGY 

4092
02:34:53,951 --> 02:34:59,189
DIAGNOSTIC REGARDING THESE 

4093
02:34:59,189 --> 02:34:59,522
ACTIVITIES.  

4094
02:34:59,522 --> 02:35:02,259
THE ONLY EXCEPTION WOULD BE FOR 

4095
02:35:02,259 --> 02:35:03,193
VIOLENT BEHAVIOR.  

4096
02:35:03,193 --> 02:35:03,861
MY QUESTION IS, DO YOU AGREE 

4097
02:35:03,861 --> 02:35:06,697
THAT FACEBOOK SHOULD BE 

4098
02:35:06,697 --> 02:35:07,698
IDEOLOGICALLY NEUTRAL?

4099
02:35:07,698 --> 02:35:12,769
>> CONGRESSMAN I AGREE WE 

4100
02:35:12,769 --> 02:35:14,238
SHOULD BE A PLATFORM FOR ALL 

4101
02:35:14,238 --> 02:35:14,671
IDEAS.

4102
02:35:14,671 --> 02:35:16,273
>> GOOD.  

4103
02:35:16,273 --> 02:35:19,777
I HAVE GOT LIMITED TIME.  

4104
02:35:19,777 --> 02:35:20,410
WITH RESPECT TO PRIVACY WE NEED 

4105
02:35:20,410 --> 02:35:22,146
TO SET A BASELINE.  

4106
02:35:22,146 --> 02:35:24,848
WHEN WE TALK ABOUT A VIRTUAL 

4107
02:35:24,848 --> 02:35:26,283
PERSON, THEIR NAME, ADDRESS, 

4108
02:35:26,283 --> 02:35:29,086
ONLINE PURCHASES, WEBSITES IS 

4109
02:35:29,086 --> 02:35:36,527
IT DID, I THINK -- MY SECOND 

4110
02:35:36,527 --> 02:35:38,162
QUESTION IS, YOU SAID EARLIER 

4111
02:35:38,162 --> 02:35:42,299
EACH USER OWNS THEIR OWN 

4112
02:35:42,299 --> 02:35:42,866
PRESENCE, DO YOU THINK THIS 

4113
02:35:42,866 --> 02:35:46,270
CONCEPT SHOULD APPLY TO ALL 

4114
02:35:46,270 --> 02:35:46,737
TECHNOLOGY PROVIDERS?

4115
02:35:46,737 --> 02:35:50,407
>> CONGRESSMAN, YES, I THINK 

4116
02:35:50,407 --> 02:35:52,876
PEOPLE OWNER --

4117
02:35:52,876 --> 02:35:54,244
>> I AM NOT TRYING TO CUT YOU 

4118
02:35:54,244 --> 02:35:57,981
OFF.  

4119
02:35:57,981 --> 02:35:58,514
IN THIS REGARD I BELIEVE 

4120
02:35:58,514 --> 02:36:04,888
CONGRESS -- IF CONGRESS ENACTS 

4121
02:36:04,888 --> 02:36:05,288
PRIVACY STANDARDS

4122
02:36:05,288 --> 02:36:06,256
JUST AS WE HAVE FOR FINANCIAL 

4123
02:36:06,256 --> 02:36:08,492
INSTITUTIONS, THE POLICY SHOULD 

4124
02:36:08,492 --> 02:36:12,329
STATE THAT THE DATA OF 

4125
02:36:12,329 --> 02:36:12,996
TECHNOLOGY USER SHOULD BE HELD 

4126
02:36:12,996 --> 02:36:13,997
PRIVATELY UNLESS THEY CONSENT 

4127
02:36:13,997 --> 02:36:18,268
TO THE USE OF THE DATA BY 

4128
02:36:18,268 --> 02:36:19,937
OTHERS.  

4129
02:36:19,937 --> 02:36:20,570
THIS RELEASE SHOULD BE BASED ON 

4130
02:36:20,570 --> 02:36:21,171
TRANSPARENCY AS TO WHAT DATA 

4131
02:36:21,171 --> 02:36:23,740
WILL BE USED.

4132
02:36:23,740 --> 02:36:24,607

4156

LET'S LISTEN TO IT.

4157
02:37:13,924 --> 02:37:14,591
>> YOU SAID THE PRESIDENT 

4158
02:37:14,591 --> 02:37:16,059
BELIEVES HE HAS THE POWER TO

FIRE ROBERT MUELLER.

4160
02:37:22,599 --> 02:37:24,301

INDIVIDUALS IN THE LEGAL 

4162
02:37:28,505 --> 02:37:29,405

TO DO SO.  

4164
02:37:31,742 --> 02:37:32,342
BUT I DON'T HAVE ANY FURTHER

4166
02:37:33,844 --> 02:37:36,780
>> SO WHY DOES HE WHITE HOUSE 

4167
02:37:36,780 --> 02:37:37,380
NOW THINK THE PRESIDENT CAN'T 

4168
02:37:37,380 --> 02:37:41,552
HIRE MUELLER?

4169
02:37:41,552 --> 02:37:42,485
>> REPORTER:  THEY WEREN'T

THE GENERAL UNDERSTANDING IS 

4173
02:37:46,589 --> 02:37:47,357
ONLY ROD ROSENSTEIN CAN FIRE 

4174
02:37:47,357 --> 02:37:48,425
SPECIAL COUNSEL.  

4175
02:37:48,425 --> 02:37:52,162
HE IS THE ONE WHO APPOINTED THE 

4176
02:37:52,162 --> 02:37:53,063
SPECIAL COUNSEL.  

4177
02:37:53,063 --> 02:37:56,332
SO IT WAS CERTAINLY NEWS WHEN 

4178
02:37:56,332 --> 02:37:56,934
THE WHITE HOUSE SAID THEY 

4179
02:37:56,934 --> 02:38:01,271
BELIEVED HE HAD THIS POWER.  

4180
02:38:01,271 --> 02:38:01,838
BUT THIS GOT A LOT OF LEGAL 

4181
02:38:01,838 --> 02:38:02,238
SCHOLARS TALKING.

4182
02:38:02,238 --> 02:38:04,575
IT IS CLEAR THERE MAY BE SOME 

4183
02:38:04,575 --> 02:38:07,778
ROOM FOR HIM ON THIS.  

4184
02:38:07,778 --> 02:38:08,278
IF HE WAS TO ORDER ROD 

4185
02:38:08,278 --> 02:38:14,384
ROSENSTEIN TO FIRE MUELLER AND 

4186
02:38:14,384 --> 02:38:15,018
HE DECLINED HE CAN GO DOWN THE 

4187
02:38:15,018 --> 02:38:15,619
LINE IN SUCCESSION TO TRY TO 

4188
02:38:15,619 --> 02:38:18,155
GET SOMEONE ELSE TO FIRE HIM.  

4189
02:38:18,155 --> 02:38:19,289
ONE OTHER THEORY IS HE COULD 

4190
02:38:19,289 --> 02:38:21,225
ORDER JEFF SESSIONS, TO DISSOLVE

4191
02:38:21,225 --> 02:38:23,694
THE REGULATION THAT PROVIDES 

4192
02:38:23,694 --> 02:38:26,196
FOR A SPECIAL COUNSEL.  

4193
02:38:26,196 --> 02:38:26,763
THAT IS ONE OF THE LEGAL 

4194
02:38:26,763 --> 02:38:30,200
THEORIES OUT THERE AS TO HOW 

4195
02:38:30,200 --> 02:38:30,800
THE PRESIDENT COULD POSSIBLY 

4196
02:38:30,800 --> 02:38:35,372
GET RID OF THE SPECIAL COUNSEL. 

4197
02:38:35,372 --> 02:38:36,506
IT REMAINS TO BE SEEN IF THE 

4198
02:38:36,506 --> 02:38:37,507
ATTORNEY GENERAL WOULD AGREE 

4199
02:38:37,507 --> 02:38:37,774
WITH THAT.

4200
02:38:37,774 --> 02:38:42,245
>> WHAT ABOUT ROD ROSENSTEIN, 

4201
02:38:42,245 --> 02:38:43,580
HOW DOES THE PRESIDENT VIEW HIS 

4202
02:38:43,580 --> 02:38:46,383
ROLE AT THIS POINT?

4203
02:38:46,383 --> 02:38:53,456
>> REPORTER:  NOT FONDLY, THE 

4204
02:38:53,456 --> 02:38:54,024
DEPUTY ATTORNEY GENERAL HAS 

4205
02:38:54,024 --> 02:38:54,658
NEVER DIRECTLY RESPONDED TO THE 

4206
02:38:54,658 --> 02:38:56,026
CRITICISM OF THE PRESIDENT.  

4207
02:38:56,026 --> 02:38:57,260
IT WAS A NEW PHASE THIS WEEK 

4208
02:38:57,260 --> 02:39:04,635
WITH THE RAID OF THE ATTORNEY.  

4209
02:39:04,635 --> 02:39:05,202
THOSE ARE BASED ON EVIDENCE 

4210
02:39:05,202 --> 02:39:05,736
THAT WAS UNCOVERED IN THE 

4211
02:39:05,736 --> 02:39:08,605
RUSSIA PROBE BUT IT DOES NOT 

4212
02:39:08,605 --> 02:39:09,672
FALL UNDER MUELLER'S 

4213
02:39:09,672 --> 02:39:11,274
RESPONSIBILITY SO THE ATTORNEY 

4214
02:39:11,274 --> 02:39:13,844
GENERAL ALLOWED THAT EVIDENCE 

4215
02:39:13,844 --> 02:39:15,946
TO BE PASSED ALONG TO A SEPARATE

4216
02:39:15,946 --> 02:39:18,248
U.S. ATTORNEY'S OFFICE IN NEW 

4217
02:39:18,248 --> 02:39:25,054
YORK.  

4218
02:39:25,054 --> 02:39:25,688
THE FACT THAT ROD ROSENSTEIN IS 

4219
02:39:25,688 --> 02:39:26,322
NOT ONLY INVOLVED IN THE RUSSIA 

4220
02:39:26,322 --> 02:39:26,890
PROBE BUT INVOLVED IN THIS 

4221
02:39:26,890 --> 02:39:27,490
SECOND CRIMINAL INVESTIGATION 

4222
02:39:27,490 --> 02:39:28,959
INTO THE PRESIDENT'S IN A CIRCLE

4223
02:39:28,959 --> 02:39:30,160
 

4224
02:39:30,160 --> 02:39:34,064
ABOUT THAT.  

4225
02:39:34,064 --> 02:39:34,664
LEGALLY SPEAKING IT DOES NOT 

4226
02:39:34,664 --> 02:39:35,298
APPEAR THAT THE DEPUTY ATTORNEY 

4227
02:39:35,298 --> 02:39:36,166
GENERAL HAS DONE ANYTHING WRONG.

4228
02:39:36,166 --> 02:39:37,400
HE IS THE ONE WHO IS OVERSEEING 

4229
02:39:37,400 --> 02:39:42,172
THE SPECIAL COUNSEL.  

4230
02:39:42,172 --> 02:39:42,739
IT IS HIS RESPONSIBILITY TO 

4231
02:39:42,739 --> 02:39:43,373
HANDLE ANY OF THE EVIDENCE AND 

4232
02:39:43,373 --> 02:39:47,444
DECIDE WHAT TO DO WITH IT.  

4233
02:39:47,444 --> 02:39:48,077
ALSO HE OVERSEES THE OPERATIONS 

4234
02:39:48,077 --> 02:39:48,545
OF THE ENTIRE JUSTICE 

4235
02:39:48,545 --> 02:39:49,313
DEPARTMENT.  

4236
02:39:49,313 --> 02:39:53,116
SO IT DOES -- SO IT IS NOT 

4237
02:39:53,116 --> 02:39:54,251
SURPRISING THAT HE WOULD BE 

4238
02:39:54,251 --> 02:40:00,057
INVOLVED.

4239
02:40:00,057 --> 02:40:01,224
>> MANY REPUBLICANS ARE WARNING 

4240
02:40:01,224 --> 02:40:01,858
THE PRESIDENT THAT RETALIATING 

4241
02:40:01,858 --> 02:40:02,392
AGAINST ANY OFFICIAL WILL 

4242
02:40:02,392 --> 02:40:05,162
CREATE A BIGGER MESS.

4243
02:40:05,162 --> 02:40:07,197
WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IF THE 

4244
02:40:07,197 --> 02:40:10,333
PRESIDENT DOES FIRE HIM?

4245
02:40:10,333 --> 02:40:11,134
>> REPORTER:  IT DEPENDS ON HOW 

4246
02:40:11,134 --> 02:40:12,603
HE GOES ABOUT IT.  

4247
02:40:12,603 --> 02:40:15,739
IF HE WAS TO ORDER THE DEPUTY 

4248
02:40:15,739 --> 02:40:16,573
ATTORNEY GENERAL TO DO IT 

4249
02:40:16,573 --> 02:40:18,241
WITHOUT CAUSE, WHAT YOU MIGHT 

4250
02:40:18,241 --> 02:40:20,643
SEE IS AS YOU WORK YOUR WAY 

4251
02:40:20,643 --> 02:40:22,812
DOWN THE LINE OF SUCCESSION 

4252
02:40:22,812 --> 02:40:24,815
EVENTUALLY YOU DO GET TO SOME 

4253
02:40:24,815 --> 02:40:25,648
U.S. ATTORNEYS WHO MAY BE 

4254
02:40:25,648 --> 02:40:30,052
WILLING TO FIRE MUELLER.  

4255
02:40:30,052 --> 02:40:30,787
IT IS ALMOST GUARANTEED IT WILL 

4256
02:40:30,787 --> 02:40:33,723
WIND UP IN COURT. 

4257
02:40:33,723 --> 02:40:37,661
THAT MUELLER WOULD CHALLENGE 

4258
02:40:37,661 --> 02:40:38,161
THAT AUTHORITY.  

4259
02:40:38,161 --> 02:40:38,828
IF THE PRESIDENT TRIED TO DO IT 

4260
02:40:38,828 --> 02:40:41,631
YOU KNOW BATTERY, THAT WOULD 

4261
02:40:41,631 --> 02:40:44,968
ALMOST WIND UP IN COURT.  

4262
02:40:44,968 --> 02:40:45,501
IT WOULD BE EXPECTED THAT 

4263
02:40:45,501 --> 02:40:46,369
MUELLER WOULD CHALLENGE THAT.  

4264
02:40:46,369 --> 02:40:49,472
AGAIN, WE WILL ALL WIND UP

4265
02:40:49,472 --> 02:40:51,608
IN COURT.

4266
02:40:51,608 --> 02:40:57,713
>> I WANT TO ASK YOU ABOUT 

4267
02:40:57,713 --> 02:40:58,114
STORMY DANIELS.  

4268
02:40:58,114 --> 02:40:58,614
WE HAVE LEARNED SHE IS 

4269
02:40:58,614 --> 02:40:59,248
COOPERATING WITH INVESTIGATORS 

4270
02:40:59,248 --> 02:41:02,786
AFTER THE RAID, HOW SIGNIFICANT 

4271
02:41:02,786 --> 02:41:05,522
IS THIS DEVELOPMENT?

4272
02:41:05,522 --> 02:41:06,256
>> REPORTER:  LEGALLY SPEAKING 

4273
02:41:06,256 --> 02:41:07,124
NOT TERRIBLY SIGNIFICANT.  

4274
02:41:07,124 --> 02:41:10,260
BUT THE FACT THAT A STORMY 

4275
02:41:10,260 --> 02:41:12,629
DANIELS WHO HAD AN AFFAIR WITH 

4276
02:41:12,629 --> 02:41:14,998
THE PRESIDENT WAS PAID TO KEEP 

4277
02:41:14,998 --> 02:41:16,933
QUIET ABOUT THE FEAR, THE FACT 

4278
02:41:16,933 --> 02:41:18,301
THAT SHE IS NOT COOPERATING 

4279
02:41:18,301 --> 02:41:22,172
WITH INVESTIGATORS INTO THIS 

4280
02:41:22,172 --> 02:41:25,208
CRIMINAL INVESTIGATION IS QUITE 

4281
02:41:25,208 --> 02:41:25,842
AN EXCITING HEADLINE BUT IT IS 

4282
02:41:25,842 --> 02:41:31,647
CERTAINLY TO BE EXPECTED.  SHE 

4283
02:41:31,647 --> 02:41:32,148
IS JUST IN CIVIL COURT 

4284
02:41:32,148 --> 02:41:33,283
CHALLENGING THE NATURE OF THIS 

4285
02:41:33,283 --> 02:41:34,283
NONDISCLOSURE, SHE WANTS TO 

4286
02:41:34,283 --> 02:41:37,788
SPEAK FREELY.

4287
02:41:37,788 --> 02:41:38,688
BUT IF THERE IS A CRIMINAL CASE 

4288
02:41:38,688 --> 02:41:41,358
THAT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH HER 

4289
02:41:41,358 --> 02:41:42,192
PERSONALLY, SHE CAN ACT AS A 

4290
02:41:42,192 --> 02:41:45,061
WITNESS, IT IS NOT SURPRISING 

4291
02:41:45,061 --> 02:41:46,296
SHE IS WILLING TO COOPERATE, 

4292
02:41:46,296 --> 02:41:46,930
ESPECIALLY SINCE HE IS NO LOVE 

4293
02:41:46,930 --> 02:41:50,033
LOST BETWEEN THAT TEAM AND 

4294
02:41:50,033 --> 02:41:52,369

4318
02:42:39,715 --> 02:42:42,152
AT A TIME WHEN REPUBLICANS FACE 

4319
02:42:42,152 --> 02:42:42,786
UNCERTAINTY.

02:44:48,511 --> 02:44:49,145
COMES AS THE ADMINISTRATION HAS 

4382
02:44:49,145 --> 02:44:49,779
BEEN CONSULTING WITH ITS ALLIES 

4383
02:44:49,779 --> 02:44:50,513
ON A JOINT MILITARY RESPONSE TO 

4384
02:44:50,513 --> 02:44:52,382
THE ALLEGED POISON GAS ATTACK.

RUSSIA AND SYRIA DENIED THE

40 PEOPLE DIED FROM THE ASSAULT

4388
02:45:02,659 --> 02:45:03,726

4389
02:45:03,726 --> 02:45:04,060
"BARBARIC."  

4390
02:45:04,060 --> 02:45:04,928
SYRIA HAS INVITED INDEPENDENT

EXPERTS TO INVESTIGATE.  

4392
02:45:06,162 --> 02:45:08,164
IT IS NOT CLEAR IF THAT VISIT 

4393
02:45:08,164 --> 02:45:09,799
MAY DELAY ANY MILITARY STRIKE ON

4394
02:45:09,799 --> 02:45:16,172
SYRIA.

4395
02:45:16,172 --> 02:45:17,406
>>> I WANT TO BRING IN DON, HE 

4396
02:45:17,406 --> 02:45:18,274
IS A FORMER INTELLIGENCE 

4397
02:45:18,274 --> 02:45:23,013
OFFICER.  

4398
02:45:23,013 --> 02:45:23,813
THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BEING 

4399
02:45:23,813 --> 02:45:24,714
WITH US.  

4400
02:45:24,714 --> 02:45:27,250
WHEN ASKED ABOUT THE TWEET THE 

4401
02:45:27,250 --> 02:45:34,090
PENTAGON REFUSED TO COMMENT.  

4402
02:45:34,090 --> 02:45:34,690
IN A STATEMENT SAID "IT DOES 

4403
02:45:34,690 --> 02:45:35,324
NOT COMMENT ON POTENTIAL FUTURE 

4404
02:45:35,324 --> 02:45:36,826
MILITARY ACTIONS."  

4405
02:45:36,826 --> 02:45:37,459
DO WE THINK THE WHITE HOUSE IS 

4406
02:45:37,459 --> 02:45:40,864
ON THE SAME PAGE WITH THE 

4407
02:45:40,864 --> 02:45:41,131
PENTAGON?

4408
02:45:41,131 --> 02:45:45,068
>> I THINK YOU NEVER WANT TO 

4409
02:45:45,068 --> 02:45:47,370
SHARE YOUR MILITARY PLANS WITH 

4410
02:45:47,370 --> 02:45:49,372
YOUR FRIENDS, ALLIES OR YOUR 

4411
02:45:49,372 --> 02:45:50,106
FOES.  

4412
02:45:50,106 --> 02:45:52,275
THE ELEMENT OF SURPRISE GIVES 

4413
02:45:52,275 --> 02:45:55,111
YOU THE BEST RESULTS IN ANY 

4414
02:45:55,111 --> 02:45:57,213
MILITARY ACTION YOU ARE TAKING. 

4415
02:45:57,213 --> 02:45:58,414
THOUGH THE PRESIDENT IS KNOWN 

4416
02:45:58,414 --> 02:46:07,057
FOR HIS SOCIAL MEDIA BUT BEHIND 

4417
02:46:07,057 --> 02:46:07,691
THE SCENES HE IS BEING BRIEFED, 

4418
02:46:07,691 --> 02:46:08,258
THE VICE PRESIDENT HAS BEEN 

4419
02:46:08,258 --> 02:46:08,892
SITTING IN ON THESE MEETINGS.  

4420
02:46:08,892 --> 02:46:09,526
THE PRESIDENT HAS CANCELED HIS 

4421
02:46:09,526 --> 02:46:10,727
TRIP, THEY ARE WORKING TOGETHER,

4422
02:46:10,727 --> 02:46:14,297
IT IS JUST THE WAY THE 

4423
02:46:14,297 --> 02:46:15,165
PRESIDENT COMMUNICATES.

4424
02:46:15,165 --> 02:46:19,802
>> IS THERE A CLEAR STRATEGY, 

4425
02:46:19,802 --> 02:46:20,370
IF THEY WERE TO BE MILITARY 

4426
02:46:20,370 --> 02:46:22,172
ACTION IS THERE A STRATEGY 

4427
02:46:22,172 --> 02:46:22,505
BEHIND THAT?

4428
02:46:22,505 --> 02:46:26,276
>> I WOULD HATE TO THINK THAT 

4429
02:46:26,276 --> 02:46:31,948
WE DON'T HAVE A CLEAR STRATEGY. 

4430
02:46:31,948 --> 02:46:33,149
WE HAVE GOT SOME GREAT MINDSS 

4431
02:46:33,149 --> 02:46:33,549
AT THE PENTAGON. 

4432
02:46:33,549 --> 02:46:34,150
I THINK THEY HAVE PLANNED FOR 

4433
02:46:34,150 --> 02:46:34,684
EVERY SCENARIO.  

4434
02:46:34,684 --> 02:46:38,220
THE GENERALS OVER THERE, THE 

4435
02:46:38,220 --> 02:46:40,356
ANALYST, THE PROFESSIONALS, 

4436
02:46:40,356 --> 02:46:41,858
THEY HAVE BEEN RESEARCHING 

4437
02:46:41,858 --> 02:46:45,962
THIS, JUST LIKE THEY HAVE FOR 

4438
02:46:45,962 --> 02:46:46,596
ANY PLAN THAT IS OUT THERE.  

4439
02:46:46,596 --> 02:46:50,300
I THINK THEY HAVE GOT IT UNDER 

4440
02:46:50,300 --> 02:46:54,170
CONTROL.  

4441
02:46:54,170 --> 02:46:54,737
WE ARE GOING TO JOIN FORCES 

4442
02:46:54,737 --> 02:46:55,337
WITH ALLIES, FRANCE, THE UK, 

4443
02:46:55,337 --> 02:46:55,938
ISRAEL, THEY ARE ALL COMING 

4444
02:46:55,938 --> 02:46:59,809
FORWARD TO SUPPORT US.  

4445
02:46:59,809 --> 02:47:03,746
THE ONLY ISSUE IS RUSSIA 

4446
02:47:03,746 --> 02:47:04,814
INTERFERES JUST AS THEY HAVE 

4447
02:47:04,814 --> 02:47:06,983
THE LAST 12 TIMES.

4448
02:47:06,983 --> 02:47:08,485
>> LET'S TALK ABOUT RUSSIA FOR 

4449
02:47:08,485 --> 02:47:17,427
A MOMENT.  HOW GREAT OF A RISK 

4450
02:47:17,427 --> 02:47:17,660
IS THAT?

4451
02:47:17,660 --> 02:47:25,535
>> THERE IS ALWAYS THAT RISK.  

4452
02:47:25,535 --> 02:47:26,168
THERE IS SO MANY UNKNOWNS WHEN 

4453
02:47:26,168 --> 02:47:26,702
YOU DEAL WITH PEOPLE LIKE 

4454
02:47:26,702 --> 02:47:27,303
BASHAR AL-ASSAD AND VLADIMIR 

4455
02:47:27,303 --> 02:47:28,705
PUTIN.  

4456
02:47:28,705 --> 02:47:29,839
BUT PRESIDENT VLADIMIR PUTIN 

4457
02:47:29,839 --> 02:47:33,977
LIKES HIS PROMOTIONAL GAME VERY 

4458
02:47:33,977 --> 02:47:34,210
WELL.  

4459
02:47:34,210 --> 02:47:34,811
HE LIKES TO PORTRAY A CERTAIN 

4460
02:47:34,811 --> 02:47:35,278
IMAGE.  

4461
02:47:35,278 --> 02:47:40,449
IN THE LONG RUN HE WILL PUT OUT 

4462
02:47:40,449 --> 02:47:41,083
A LOT OF PROPAGANDA, HE WILL BE 

4463
02:47:41,083 --> 02:47:47,157
VERY STRONG IN HIS WORDS, BUT I 

4464
02:47:47,157 --> 02:47:48,525
THINK HE WILL DO THE RIGHT THING

4465
02:47:48,525 --> 02:47:50,260
AND HE WILL STAND BY BASHAR AL-

4466
02:47:50,260 --> 02:47:52,729
ASSAD AS LONG AS IT DOES NOT 

4467
02:47:52,729 --> 02:47:57,467
CREATE A RISK FOR HIM.

4468
02:47:57,467 --> 02:47:58,567
>> LAST YEAR THE PRESIDENT 

4469
02:47:58,567 --> 02:48:01,671
STOOD ALONE IN HIS STRIKE 

4470
02:48:01,671 --> 02:48:02,172
AGAINST SYRIA.  

4471
02:48:02,172 --> 02:48:02,739
NOW IT APPEARS BRITAIN AND 

4472
02:48:02,739 --> 02:48:05,508
FRANCE MAY BE CONSIDERING 

4473
02:48:05,508 --> 02:48:06,176
ACTION AS WELL.  

4474
02:48:06,176 --> 02:48:06,809
HOW IMPORTANT IS IT THAT THERE 

4475
02:48:06,809 --> 02:48:10,480
IS A JOINT RESPONSE?

4476
02:48:10,480 --> 02:48:11,347
>> A FEW WEEKS AGO THE BIG 

4477
02:48:11,347 --> 02:48:13,950
THING THE PRESIDENT CAME FORWARD

4478
02:48:13,950 --> 02:48:14,717
TALKING ABOUT IT WAS TIME FOR 

4479
02:48:14,717 --> 02:48:15,818
OTHER COUNTRIES TO STEP UP AND 

4480
02:48:15,818 --> 02:48:19,255
START PAYING THEIR PART.  

4481
02:48:19,255 --> 02:48:19,889
IT WAS ONE OF THE BIG THINGS HE 

4482
02:48:19,889 --> 02:48:22,258
SPOKE OF WITH NATO EARLY IN HIS 

4483
02:48:22,258 --> 02:48:23,393
PRESIDENCY.  

4484
02:48:23,393 --> 02:48:25,128
I THINK THIS IS A GOOD SIGN 

4485
02:48:25,128 --> 02:48:29,399
BECAUSE HE WAS THERE TO ALIGN 

4486
02:48:29,399 --> 02:48:34,003
WITH THE PRESIDENT, I BELIEVE 

4487
02:48:34,003 --> 02:48:34,536
IT WAS YESTERDAY OR THIS 

4488
02:48:34,536 --> 02:48:35,104
MORNING THE PRESIDENT SPOKE 

4489
02:48:35,104 --> 02:48:38,274
WITH THERESA MAY, ISRAEL IS ON 

4490
02:48:38,274 --> 02:48:40,776
BOARD, THAT SHOWS THAT THE 

4491
02:48:40,776 --> 02:48:42,545
WORLD IS KIND OF COME TOGETHER, 

4492
02:48:42,545 --> 02:48:46,015
THEY AGREE WHATEVER HAPPENS IN 

4493
02:48:46,015 --> 02:48:49,252
SYRIA -- THERE ARE A LOT OF 

4494
02:48:49,252 --> 02:48:50,220
MOVING PIECES BUT, CHEMICAL 

4495
02:48:50,220 --> 02:48:54,090
WEAPONS AGAINST YOUR PEOPLE, 

4496
02:48:54,090 --> 02:48:56,793
THAT IS JUST WRONG.  

4497
02:48:56,793 --> 02:48:57,426
IT SHOWS WHAT KIND OF PERSON WE 

4498
02:48:57,426 --> 02:48:58,594
ARE DEALING WITH. 

4499
02:48:58,594 --> 02:49:04,601
CIVIL WAR IS ONE THING, BUT, TO 

4500
02:49:04,601 --> 02:49:05,568
GAS AND POISON YOUR OWN CITIZENS

4501
02:49:05,568 --> 02:49:09,872
, THAT IS JUST A CRIME.

4502
02:49:09,872 --> 02:49:10,673
>> IT SEEMS TO PUT BACK ON A 

4503
02:49:10,673 --> 02:49:16,646
TIMELINE PULLING OUT OF SYRIA.  

4504
02:49:16,646 --> 02:49:21,584
LET'S IMAGINE THE U.S. DOES 

4505
02:49:21,584 --> 02:49:22,184
PULL OUT, THAT WOULD RESHAPE 

4506
02:49:22,184 --> 02:49:23,119
WHO HAS POWER IN THE COUNTRY.  

4507
02:49:23,119 --> 02:49:26,122
WHAT WOULD IT THEN LOOK LIKE IF 

4508
02:49:26,122 --> 02:49:28,091
RUSSIA AND IRAQ WERE LEFT IN 

4509
02:49:28,091 --> 02:49:28,324
CHARGE?

4510
02:49:28,324 --> 02:49:31,728
>> YOU ARE RIGHT, A FEW WEEKS 

4511
02:49:31,728 --> 02:49:32,328
AGO THE PRESIDENT WAS ADAMANT 

4512
02:49:32,328 --> 02:49:36,766
THAT IT WAS TIME TO PULL OUT.  

4513
02:49:36,766 --> 02:49:42,105
BUT I THINK IF YOU LOOK AT THAT 

4514
02:49:42,105 --> 02:49:42,705
NOW, THE PEOPLE WHO WOULD BE 

4515
02:49:42,705 --> 02:49:43,339
STTING AT THAT TABLE WOULD BE 

4516
02:49:43,339 --> 02:49:45,208
THE IRANIANS AND THE RUSSIANS, 

4517
02:49:45,208 --> 02:49:51,914
BEING THAT CLOAKS TO ISRAEL, -- 

4518
02:49:51,914 --> 02:49:52,548
BEING THAT CLOSE TO IS YOUR, WE 

4519
02:49:52,548 --> 02:49:54,184
DO NOT WANT TO WALK AWAY FROM 

4520
02:49:54,184 --> 02:50:01,824
THE TABLE.  

4521
02:50:01,824 --> 02:50:02,391
AROUND THE HOLIDAYS ALL THE 

4522
02:50:02,391 --> 02:50:04,093
FAMILY COMES TOGETHER, AS LONG 

4523
02:50:04,093 --> 02:50:05,895
AS THE SENIOR GRANDFATHER IS 

4524
02:50:05,895 --> 02:50:10,833
THERE PEOPLE TEND TO BEHAVE. 

4525
02:50:10,833 --> 02:50:14,270
LET'S LET UNCLE SAM BE THE 

4526
02:50:14,270 --> 02:50:16,205
SENIOR.

4527
02:50:16,205 --> 02:50:17,339
>> SO WHO IS ADVISING THE 

4528
02:50:17,339 --> 02:50:17,907
PRESIDENT AND HOW COULD HIS 

4529
02:50:17,907 --> 02:50:21,578
CABINET IMPACT DIPLOMACY IN 

4530
02:50:21,578 --> 02:50:21,878

4815
03:05:36,625 --> 03:05:37,492

PASSING TAX REFORM LEGISLATION

4832
03:06:07,622 --> 03:06:09,724

ACHIEVEMENTS AND ASSURED MEMBERS

4834
03:06:10,859 --> 03:06:13,095

4843
03:06:24,839 --> 03:06:26,775
ZEKE, WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF THE

4844
03:06:26,775 --> 03:06:28,076
TIMING OF RYAN'S ANNOUNCEMENT?

4845
03:06:28,076 --> 03:06:30,012
DOES THIS EFFECTIVELY MAKE HIM A

4846
03:06:30,012 --> 03:06:32,614
LAME DUCK FOR THE NEXT NINE

4847
03:06:32,614 --> 03:06:32,848
MONTHS?

4848
03:06:32,848 --> 03:06:34,549
>> CONGRESS ISN'T GOING TO BE

4849
03:06:34,549 --> 03:06:36,584
DOING A WHOLE LOT ANYWAY.

4850
03:06:36,584 --> 03:06:38,053
OBVIOUSLY THE TIMING IS DICTATED

4851
03:06:38,053 --> 03:06:39,087
BECAUSE SOMETHING LIKE THIS

4852
03:06:39,087 --> 03:06:40,822
CAN'T BE A SECRET IN WASHINGTON

4853
03:06:40,822 --> 03:06:41,690
FOR VERY LONG.

4854
03:06:41,690 --> 03:06:45,193

BACK TO THE HOUSE.

4861
03:06:54,269 --> 03:06:56,071
BUT IN TERMS OF LEGISLATING IN

4862
03:06:56,071 --> 03:06:57,172
WASHINGTON, THERE'S NOT A WHOLE

4863
03:06:57,172 --> 03:07:00,308
LOT OF JUICE THAT PAUL RYAN HAS.

4864
03:07:00,308 --> 03:07:01,643
LAWMAKERS ARE VERY -- AT THIS

4865
03:07:01,643 --> 03:07:03,045
POINT AT THAT STAGE IN THE

4867
03:07:04,446 --> 03:07:07,416
SELFISHLY FOCUSED ON THEIR OWN

4868
03:07:07,416 --> 03:07:13,855

03:07:15,557 --> 03:07:17,859
ACTUALLY DO OF ANY SUBSTANCE,

4871
03:07:17,859 --> 03:07:19,328
