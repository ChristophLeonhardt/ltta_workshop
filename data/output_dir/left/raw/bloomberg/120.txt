00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:06,450
Take a look at the back of any iPhone and
you'll see a familiar phrase that's been printed

2
00:00:06,450 --> 00:00:10,200
on almost one billion units of the iconic
product.

3
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:13,040
Designed by Apple in California.

4
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:14,799
Assembled in China

5
00:00:14,799 --> 00:00:17,860
Like everything at Apple, that wording is
deliberate.

6
00:00:17,860 --> 00:00:23,290
Apple designs the exterior, writes the software,
researches new technologies and develops its

7
00:00:23,290 --> 00:00:29,740
own chips in California, which allows it to
to sell devices for 65 percent more than their cost

8
00:00:30,760 --> 00:00:33,840
But iPhones are assembled in China for a reason.

9
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:36,890
It's easy to assume that reason is cheaper
labor.

10
00:00:36,890 --> 00:00:40,360
While wages are lower, this doesn't tell the
whole story.

11
00:00:40,360 --> 00:00:45,010
In fact, assembly is only 2% of an iPhones
hardware cost.

12
00:00:45,010 --> 00:00:51,520
Today, most iPhones are made in two chinese
cities: Shenzhen and Zhengzhou.

13
00:00:51,530 --> 00:00:55,260
Favorable government policies helped Shenzhen
become the electronics factory to the world

14
00:00:55,260 --> 00:00:59,170
… with Taiwanese company Foxconn its biggest
employer.

15
00:00:59,170 --> 00:01:04,649
As a result, thousands of companies and millions
of workers have moved to the southern Chinese

16
00:01:04,649 --> 00:01:07,570
city to be close to the action.

17
00:01:07,570 --> 00:01:12,960
During peak iPhone season, Foxconn hires almost
a million people, cutting its workforce to

18
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:16,100
a few hundred thousand during low season.

19
00:01:16,100 --> 00:01:20,620
Such a cluster effect in Shenzhen means that
most of the components needed to make a phone,

20
00:01:20,620 --> 00:01:24,940
a laptop, or a drone are within a fifty mile
radius.

21
00:01:24,940 --> 00:01:28,460
Attempts to recreate this cluster have so
far failed.

22
00:01:28,460 --> 00:01:31,280
Brazil is the perfect example…

23
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:36,790
Apple was facing high import tariffs in Brazil
and urged Foxconn to make iPhones there.

24
00:01:36,790 --> 00:01:41,380
After securing local incentives, Foxconn built
a factory.

25
00:01:41,380 --> 00:01:44,020
But very little changed.

26
00:01:44,020 --> 00:01:49,460
Rather than doing lots of high-level manufacturing
in Brazil, Foxconn continued to do most of

27
00:01:49,460 --> 00:01:55,840
the work back in China where the supply chain was nearby and parts could be preassembled.

28
00:01:55,840 --> 00:02:01,020
This meant that most of an iPhone was made
in China and merely shipped to Brazil for

29
00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:04,729
local workers to slot together like lego.

30
00:02:04,729 --> 00:02:09,840
In the end, the Brazil project failed on two
levels - it hired a fraction of the workers

31
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:15,739
the government had expected and it didn’t
attract any of Apple’s hundreds of suppliers.

32
00:02:15,739 --> 00:02:20,430
If an iPhone is to be made in the U.S., it’s
more likely to follow the Brazil model, not

33
00:02:20,430 --> 00:02:26,029
the Shenzhen model, which means far few jobs
and for those workers, making for Apple would

34
00:02:26,029 --> 00:02:29,019
be as seasonal as picking apples.

35
00:02:29,019 --> 00:02:32,940
So while the U.S. could one day boast an iPhone
"Assembled in America."

36
00:02:32,940 --> 00:00:00,000
the question is, does it really want to?
