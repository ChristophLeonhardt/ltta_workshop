corruption is in a way contagious corruption corrupts if one would actually see the map of corruption one would see some countries in which corruption is very prevalent and some countries in which it's not so prevalent actually very rare but this is political corruption this is how the large scale different states have a predisposition to respect the norms to respected rules or to not respect them the question is is this global political societal corruption related to how people within these countries will undergo some minor forms of cheating in very simple day-to-day things so when you live in a society in which at the large scale the political values are those of not respecting the norms then there is a growing number of low scale corruption within all the people that live within this country specifically now in the world were particularly in the u.s. we are seeing a spike of mistrust you can rapidly imagine of the Facebook scandal of trumpeting fake news and many other examples by which people are lacking the trust in the institution the map of corruption is not static it changes with time societies make big changes where they become more or less corrupt and then one can ask what happens downstream from these changes so the experiment goes like this is again just throwing the dice and personai will throw the dice and then person B will throw another dice and both of them will be paid only if the dice have the same value but now the gain is not only for himself or for hims herself but also for the other party and this is another temptation for cheating because I'm not cheating for myself I'm also cheating for another person and so this notion of small solidarity actually increases enormously to the point that when this experiment is done like say with 200 people the fraction of equal dies should be one sixth of that but almost 180 people are getting paid in this experiment and one can see the amount of cheating and see whether this amount of cheating in a dice in a single person that's cheating four three four five six or seven dollars actually correlates to the amount of corruption that this country has at the societal level the results we saw of the ice experiment show that long-term political corruption results on the propagation of minor forms of corruption in the people that live in the societies now there is an episode of lack of trust and it seems to be different ways that this could undergo so in a way this sharp spiking episodes seem like a bifurcation point where societies do have an opportunity to think whether they want to continue on the way of mistrust or they want to react to it by understanding how important Trust is to the construction of societies
