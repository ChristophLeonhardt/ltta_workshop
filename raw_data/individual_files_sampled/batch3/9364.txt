Sean: ALL RIGHT. HERE WITH REACTION TO ALL THIS BREAKING NEWS TODAY. HE'S THE HOST OF LEVIN TV RIGHT HERE ON THE FOX NEWS CHANNEL, NUMBER-ONE SHOW, SUNDAY NIGHTS, 10:00 EASTERN. I CALL HIM THE GREAT ONE. "LIFE, LIBERTY AND LEVIN" IS THE NAME OF THE SHOW. WE HAVE THE APPOINTMENT MUELLER BY ROD ROSENSTEIN BECAUSE SIXS IS RECUSED. YOU HAVE BEEN SAYING IN THE LAST 24 HOURS ON YOUR RADIO SHOW, AND YOU TOLD ME PRIVATELY, THAT THIS VERY WELL VIOLATES OUR CONSTITUTION AND MORE SPECIFICALLY THE APPOINTMENT'S CLAUSE. I WANT YOU TO REALLY EXPLAIN THIS TO OUR AUDIENCE TONIGHT. FIRST OF ALL, THE SEED WAS PLANTED WHEN I HAT TIPPED THE PROFESSOR, AN OLD FRIEND OF MINE WHO WORKED FOR ATTORNEY GENERAL MEESE. THE APPOINTMENTS CLAUSE. IT'S IN THE CONSTITUTION. IT APPLIES TO PRINCIPAL OFFICERS OF THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH. THAT'S INTERIOR OFFICERS, YOU KNOW, LIKE A CHIEF, AN ADMINISTRATIVE ASSISTANT, THEN PRINCIPAL OFFICERS. EVERY SINGLE UNITED STATES ATTORNEY IN THE UNITED STATES HAS TO BE NOMINATED BY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES AND CONFIRMED BY THE SENATE BECAUSE OUR FOUNDERS MADE CLEAR THAT THEY WANTED BOTH BRANCHES OF GOVERNMENT INVOLVED IN APPOINTMENTS OF THE SENIOR LEVEL PEOPLE. YOU HAVE ASSISTANT SCARIES IN DEPARTMENTS AND CABINET SECRETARIES AND U.S. ATTORNEYS. HERE'S THE PROBLEM. THE APPOINTMENT OF MUELLER IS UTTERLY UNCONSTITUTION FOR A NUMBER OF REASONS. ROD ROSENSTEIN GAVE HIM AN AGENDA THAT IS SO BROAD, NOT A SPECIFIC INDIVIDUAL, NOT A SPECIFIC STATUTE, NOT EVEN A SPECIFIC MATTER, AND NOT ONLY WAS THE INITIAL APPOINTMENT INCREDIBLY BROAD, HE KEEPS EXPANDING IT. SO THIS SPECIAL COUNSEL'S DIFFERENT THAN PAST SPECIAL COUNSELS. HE'S MORE LIKE A ROVG U.S. ATTORNEY. ALSO, WE LEARNED SOMETHING TODAY THAT IS ABSOLUTELY INCREDIBLE. IT SAYS COURT FILINGS INDICATE WHEN LAWYERS APPEARED IN COURT EARLIER THIS YEAR, THEY DID SO NOT ONLY AS REPRESENTATIVES OF MUELLER'S OFFICE BUT THEY RECEIVED AN APPOINTMENT, A SPECIAL ASSISTANT UNITED STATES ATTORNEY APPOINTMENT IN THE EASTERN DISTRICT OF VIRGINIA. THEY ARE, IN EFFECT, ASSISTANT UNITED STATES ATTORNEYS. ROBERT MUELLER WANTED TO EXPAND THEIR POWER. THEY REPORT TO HIM. IF THEY'RE ASSISTANT UNITED STATES ATTORNEYS OR SPECIAL ASSISTANT UNITED STATES ATTORNEYS THAT MAKES MUELLER, WITHOUT QUESTION, THE EQUIVALENT OF THE UNITED STATES ATTORNEY. WHAT'S UNIQUE ABOUT HIM AND PAST INDEPENDENT COUNSEL AND SPECIAL COUNSEL IS THE MASSIVE BREADTH OF HIS INVESTIGATION. HE'S GOING TO INTO BANK FRAUD, WIRE FRAUD, HE'S GOING INTO RUSSIA, A NUMBER OF OTHER COUNTRIES. HE'S INTERVIEWED HUNDREDS OF INDIVIDUALS, TENS OF THOUSANDS, HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF DOCUMENTS. HE'S NOT AN INTERIOR EMPLOYEE, LIKE AN STRAV ASSISTANT OR ANYTHING OF THAT SORT. HE'S A PRINCIPAL OFFICER. UNDER THE APPOINTMENTS CLAUSE OF THE UNITED STATES CONSTITUTION, ARTICLE II, Mr. ROSENSTEIN USURPED THE AUTHORITY OF THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES TO NOMINATE WHOMEVER HE WANTS AS PROSECUTOR AND Mr. ROSENSTEIN STATES SMATH WHICH HAS THE CONTROL Mr. MUELLER IS SERVING UNCONSTITUTIONALLY IN VIOLATION OF THE APPOINTMENTS CLAUSE OF THE CONSTITUTION BECAUSE OF THE WAY ROSENSTEIN APPOINTED HIM, BECAUSE OF EXPANDING HIS AUTHORITY, BECAUSE Mr. MUELLER HAS EXPANDED HIS OWN AUTHORITY WITH THESE FOUR NOW ASSISTANT UNITED STATES ATTORNEYS AND EVERY DEFENDANT IN THIS CASE, EVERY WITNESS IN THIS CASE, EVERYBODY WHO RECEIVED A SUBPOENA IN THIS CASE, WHATEVER FEDERAL COURT IT IS, SHOULD RAISE THE ISSUE OF THE APPOINTMENTS CLAUSE OF THE CONSTITUTION THAT Mr. MUELLER IS CONDUCTING HIMSELF AND IS APPOINTMENT IS UNCONSTITUTIONAL. SEE, HERE'S THE DEAL. THESE CAREER BUREAUCRAT PROSECUTORS, THEY DON'T UNDERSTAND THE CONSTITUTION. THEY UNDERSTAND PARTS OF IT, LIKE DUE PROCESS AND PROXIMATE CAUSE. THEY NEVER READ THE APPOINTMENTS CLAUS. THEY NEVER READ THE SUPREME COURT DECISIONS INVOLVED IN THAT. I HAVE. PROFESSOR HAS. I WANT YOUR AUDIENCE TO KNOW THIS, TOO. SO, Mr. MUELLER, UNLIKE ANY PAST SPECIAL COUNSEL OR ANY PAST INDEPENDENT COUNSEL, THE BREADTH OF HIS INVESTIGATION IS SO MASSIVE, IT'S SO BROAD BY THE INITIAL APPOINTMENT, THE SUBSEQUENT EXPANSION AND NOW FOUR OF HIS OWN PEOPLE GETTING DUAL APPOINTMENTS AS EFFECTIVELY AN ASSISTANT UNITED STATES ATTORNEYS, Mr. MUELLER, HIS CONDUCT, HIS APPOINTMENT IS UNCONSTITUTIONAL. Sean: YOU KNOW, THAT'S WHY I CALL YOU THE GREAT ONE. WHAT YOU SAY I HOPE EVERY ATTORNEY INVOLVED IN THIS CASE HEARD YOU AND IF YOU'RE OUT UP ON foxnews.com PLEASE TWEET IT OUT, PLEASE USE SOCIAL MEDIA AND MAKE SURE THIS GOES VIRAL. ALL YOU ATTORNEYS OUT THERE, GO FOR IT, BABY. I KNOW WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT IT. Sean: THAT'S WHY WE CALL YOU THE GREAT ONE.
