the Muslim Council of Britain is calling for an inquiry into his llama phobia in the Conservative Party give me a break the Tory deputy chair James cleverly has had to deny that his party has an Islamophobia problem the issue is arisen because perpetual victim baroness warsi is back on the warpath again moaning that there are near weekly incidents of Islamophobic events to be fair to cleverly he's right when he says that all political parties have individuals that say and do things that are inappropriate he's right but this is different actually to the Labour Party the Labour Party doesn't just have some bonkers candidates that are saying mental things they have a leadership with a terrible history of anti-semitism and so in candidates come out with anti-semitic remarks it's truly a reflection on the party if flavor can't kick out its anti-semites at the top then it might as well be endorsing them in my view and this is so so different to what's happening now with the Conservative Party so here's what exactly is going on there have been multiple candidates and members who have said less than lovely things about Islam lately the Conservative council candidate for instance in Watford is Darren Harrison he was suspended from the party in April for supporting generation identity you're another candidate actually it was in Hackney Alexander vanta Hayden and he was suspended for having attended an EDL rally God knows when and posting that Islam is a violent political ideology and then there was the Conservative councillor Mike Payne who was suspended recently for sharing an article that labeled some Muslims as parasites it seems to me like some Tory candidates are just getting sick of the wets in the Conservative Party it's not particularly interesting really and nobody can honestly say honestly that the Conservative Party is anti-muslim don't forget that it's this Conservative government that's banned most anti Islam activists from entering the country it was Theresa May who banned Pamela Geller and Robert Spencer and amber rod who banned Lutz Backman and others early this year but I tell you what is interesting is that the Muslim Council of Britain is trying to take the moral high ground ha let's take a look at the Muslim Council of Britain shall we so this is an organization but even David Cameron admitted had a problem back in 2015 Cameron admitted that the MTB has a problem after it started claiming that ministers were behaving like the far-right so this isn't the first time that the MTB has moaned about the Tory party and majid no Arthur slammed the NC B for working with extremists no I'm sorry Muslim Council of Britain that simply doesn't work you can't argue on the one hand that Muslims aren't extremists that all Muslims aren't extremists and then in your own County extremism plan make it very publicly known that you plan to work with extremists because you think the best way to stop terrorists is by working with those who have homophobic anti-semitic and other bigoted anti-woman views and do you remember the Trojan horse report well the MTB was quick to reject the findings of the report which found that Islamists have been plotting to take over schools in Birmingham they claimed that the report written by Peter Clark the former tech counter-terror Jeep in the met was simply conflating conservative Muslim practices to a supposed ideology and agenda to Islam I secular schools excuse us for confusing conservative Islamic views which include serious hatred of gay people and women for a conservative effort to take over schools and manipulate children it's not like Clark has scrutinized over 3000 messages sent via social media between teachers that talked about Lee Rigby's murder being a hoax and gay people being animals I think the key finding is that in the face of the allegations that have been made I have established that there is a group of associated individuals in positions of influence in schools and governing bodies who have over a quite a considerable period of time looked to introduce what could be described as an aggressive Islamist agenda into some schools very few schools in Birmingham I think it's perfectly reasonable in light of what I've seen in the evidence I've heard that people quite possibly might have been reticent in challenging some of these practices for fear that they would be accused of either Islamophobia or racism so when the MCB tried to take the moral high ground I can't help but laugh no there isn't a problem criticism of Islam in the Tory party if there was millions of people across the country would probably have more of a reason to vote for them if you want to see more from me and the rest of the rebel team remember to download our app on the Apple App Store and the Google Play Store and like and subscribe you
