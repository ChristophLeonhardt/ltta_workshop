SESSION BACK AND FORTH. WE WILL GO THERE WHEN IT BREAKS UP. THE PRESIDENT IS EXPECTED TO SPEAK TO REPORTERS OF THAT MICROPHONE. IT WAS ANOTHER DAY OF SOME INTENSE QUESTIONING FOR THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT INSPECTOR GENERAL TODAY. AT ISSUE, WHAT PART POLITICS AND PREJUDICE PLAYED IN THE FBI'S INVESTIGATION OF THE HILLARY CLINTON EMAIL SCANDAL AND BY EXTENSION THE ONGOING PROBE INTO RUSSIA ELECTION INTERFERENCE. CATHERINE HERRIDGE IS WATCHING. THEY PREJUDGED THE OUTCOME OF THE HILLARY CLINTON EMAIL INVESTIGATION BEFORE THE INVESTIGATION ENDED. THESE EXACT SAME FBI AGENTS AND ATTORNEYS PREJUDGED THE OUTCOME OF THE RUSSIA INVESTIGATION BEFORE IT EVEN BEGAN. DURING A SECOND DAY OF TESTIMONY, LAWMAKERS PRESSED MICHAEL HOROWITZ OVER WHAT REPUBLICANS DESCRIBED AS POLITICAL BIAS AT THE FBI IMPACTING THE PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN.

THE HOWLING ABOUT "LOCK HER UP" WAS BOGUS. IT WAS BASELESS. IT WAS UNSUBSTANTIATED. JAMES COMEY DECIDED TO PLAY JUDGE, JURY, AND EXECUTIONER. ON OCTOBER 28 COME HE EXECUTED THE HILLARY CLINTON CAMPAIGN. THE HEARING CONCLUDED AFTER SIX AND A HALF HOURS OF TESTIMONY. INSPECTOR GENERAL HOROWITZ CONFIRMED HE IS FOLLOWING UP ON ALLEGATIONS THAT FBI INTERVIEW SUMMARIES WERE ALTERED. Bret: THERE WAS SOME LATE NEWS THIS AFTERNOON ON FBI AGENT PETER STRZOK.
