1
00:00:10,638 --> 00:00:12,073
>> Bret: THIS IS A PRIMARY DAY

00:00:12,073 --> 00:00:14,042
IN PENNSYLVANIA, AND A FEW OTHER

3
00:00:14,042 --> 00:00:16,511
STATES AS WELL.

4
00:00:16,511 --> 00:00:18,146
IN P.A., VOTERS ARE

5
00:00:18,146 --> 00:00:19,214
PARTICIPATING UNDER A NEWLY

6
00:00:19,214 --> 00:00:21,482
DRAWN CONGRESSIONAL MAP.

7
00:00:21,482 --> 00:00:22,250
REPUBLICANS ARE CHOOSING G.O.P.

8
00:00:22,250 --> 00:00:24,752
CHALLENGERS TO DEMOCRATIC

00:00:24,752 --> 00:00:27,288
GOVERNOR TOM WOLF AND BOB CASEY.

10
00:00:27,288 --> 00:00:28,690
ERIC SHAWN IS IN HAZLETON

11
00:00:28,690 --> 00:00:31,125
TONIGHT WITH THE LATEST.

12
00:00:31,125 --> 00:00:32,726
GOOD EVENING, ERIC.

13
00:00:32,726 --> 00:00:35,129
>> GOOD EVENING >> NINE.

14
00:00:35,129 --> 00:00:36,931
SOME THINK THAT THE RACES HERE

15
00:00:36,931 --> 00:00:37,699
IN PENNSYLVANIA COULD EVENTUALLY

16
00:00:37,699 --> 00:00:39,133
HELP TO CONTROL OF THE HOUSE.

17
00:00:39,133 --> 00:00:41,202
IN FACT THE CHAIRMAN OF THE

18
00:00:41,202 --> 00:00:42,370
STATE G.O.P. TODAY PREDICTED

19
00:00:42,370 --> 00:00:43,104
THAT THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY COULD

20
00:00:43,104 --> 00:00:45,573
PICK UP AS MANY AS FIVE SEATS IN

21
00:00:45,573 --> 00:00:48,142
NOVEMBER, AND THE REASON HE SAID

22
00:00:48,142 --> 00:00:50,144
IS IT REDISTRICTING.

23
00:00:50,144 --> 00:00:52,146
TODAY, 84 CANDIDATES ARE RUNNING

24
00:00:52,146 --> 00:00:52,747
IN 18 NEW CONGRESSIONAL

25
00:00:52,747 --> 00:00:54,582
DISTRICTS THAT WERE READ IRAN

26
00:00:54,582 --> 00:00:55,950
AFTER THE STATE SUPREME COURT

27
00:00:55,950 --> 00:00:57,552
RULED THE OLD LINES WERE

28
00:00:57,552 --> 00:00:58,987
PARTISAN AND VIOLATED THE

29
00:00:58,987 --> 00:00:59,787
STATE'S CONSTITUTION.

30
00:00:59,787 --> 00:01:01,189
THE DEMOCRATS SAY THAT RULING

31
00:01:01,189 --> 00:01:02,824
LEAVE END OF THE PLAYING FIELD

32
00:01:02,824 --> 00:01:05,426
BUT REPUBLICANS ARE ANGRY

33
00:01:05,426 --> 00:01:07,895
AGAINST THAT, CRYING FOUL.

34
00:01:07,895 --> 00:01:08,596
MEANWHILE, PRESIDENT TRUMP IS

35
00:01:08,596 --> 00:01:09,330
LOOMING LARGE IN THAT SENATE

36
00:01:09,330 --> 00:01:12,500
RACE.

37
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:14,502
HE HAS ENDORSED CONGRESSMAN LOU

38
00:01:14,502 --> 00:01:15,703
BARLETTA, WHO TODAY WE

39
00:01:15,703 --> 00:01:17,005
INTERVIEWED AND DISCUSSED THE

40
00:01:17,005 --> 00:01:19,507
ISSUE OF IMMIGRATION.

41
00:01:19,507 --> 00:01:21,209
HE MADE NATIONAL HEADLINES IN

42
00:01:21,209 --> 00:01:22,510
2006 TARGETING THAT ISSUE WHEN

43
00:01:22,510 --> 00:01:24,479
THE CITY ENACTED LAWS THAT DENY

44
00:01:24,479 --> 00:01:25,213
PERMITS TO BUSINESSES WHO HIRED

45
00:01:25,213 --> 00:01:28,516
ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS, LANDLORDS

46
00:01:28,516 --> 00:01:29,917
WHO RENTED TO ILLEGALS, AND

47
00:01:29,917 --> 00:01:32,487
DECLARED THAT ENGLISH IS THE

48
00:01:32,487 --> 00:01:33,121
CITY'S OFFICIAL LANGUAGE.

49
00:01:33,121 --> 00:01:35,356
TODAY, HE TOLD US THAT EVEN

50
00:01:35,356 --> 00:01:36,491
THOUGH THOSE LAWS WERE

51
00:01:36,491 --> 00:01:37,992
EVENTUALLY STRUCK DOWN, THEY

52
00:01:37,992 --> 00:01:39,093
REMAIN MEANINGFUL IN THIS

53
00:01:39,093 --> 00:01:42,130
ECONOMICALLY DEPRESSED AREA.

54
00:01:42,130 --> 00:01:43,564
>> THE NATIONAL MEDIA SAID

55
00:01:43,564 --> 00:01:45,633
DONALD TRUMP COULD NEVER WIN

56
00:01:45,633 --> 00:01:48,069
PENNSYLVANIA, BUT DONALD TRUMP

57
00:01:48,069 --> 00:01:48,569
WON PENNSYLVANIA.

58
00:01:48,569 --> 00:01:52,507
THE NATIONAL MEDIA IS SAYING HE

59
00:01:52,507 --> 00:01:53,808
COULD NEVER BEAT BUCK CASEY, BUT

60
00:01:53,808 --> 00:01:55,910
WE WILL SEE WHAT HAPPENS HERE

61
00:01:55,910 --> 00:01:57,645
BECAUSE HE HASN'T RESISTED,

62
00:01:57,645 --> 00:01:58,746
OBJECTIVE AND OBSTRUCTED EVERY

63
00:01:58,746 --> 00:01:59,314
SINGLE THING THAT

64
00:01:59,314 --> 00:02:00,515
PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS WANTED TO DO

65
00:02:00,515 --> 00:02:02,784
ON HIS AGENDA.

66
00:02:02,784 --> 00:02:06,120
>> ALSO VYING FOR THE G.O.P. NOD

67
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:07,922
IS STATE REPRESENTATIVE JIM

68
00:02:07,922 --> 00:02:08,489
CHRISTIANA.

69
00:02:08,489 --> 00:02:10,291
HE'S BANKING ON HIS LEGISLATIVE

70
00:02:10,291 --> 00:02:11,125
EXPERIENCE IN HARRISBURG SAYING

71
00:02:11,125 --> 00:02:13,227
HE CAN BRING A BIPARTISAN SPIRIT

72
00:02:13,227 --> 00:02:13,728
TO WASHINGTON.

73
00:02:13,728 --> 00:02:15,630
HE TOLD US HE'S NOT AT ALL

74
00:02:15,630 --> 00:02:17,732
BOTHERED THAT THE PRESIDENT IS

75
00:02:17,732 --> 00:02:18,866
BACKING HIS OPPONENT.

76
00:02:18,866 --> 00:02:20,401
>> I UNDERSTAND THAT THE

77
00:02:20,401 --> 00:02:23,805
PRESIDENT REWARDS LOYALTY, AND I

78
00:02:23,805 --> 00:02:24,605
CAN APPRECIATE THAT.

79
00:02:24,605 --> 00:02:26,908
THERE IS NO HARD FEELINGS.

80
00:02:26,908 --> 00:02:28,810
IF YOU LISTEN TO THE MESSAGE,

81
00:02:28,810 --> 00:02:32,513
IT'S NOT BASED ON MERIT.

82
00:02:32,513 --> 00:02:37,085
AND I THINK THAT MY RECORD COMES

83
00:02:37,085 --> 00:02:39,921
FROM AND SPEAKS FOR THEMSELVES.

84
00:02:39,921 --> 00:02:41,189
>> WHOEVER WINS TONIGHT COULD

85
00:02:41,189 --> 00:02:43,024
HAVE A TOUGH ROW AGAINST THE

86
00:02:43,024 --> 00:02:43,891
INCUMBENT SENATOR.

87
00:02:43,891 --> 00:02:45,760
CASEY IS A THREE TERM INCUMBENT

88
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:47,929
AND THE SON OF STORIED FORMER

89
00:02:47,929 --> 00:02:50,064
GOVERNOR ROBERT PKC.

90
00:02:50,064 --> 00:02:52,467
WE REACHED OUT TO THE CASEY

91
00:02:52,467 --> 00:02:53,735
CAMPAIGN AND THEY HAVE NOT

92
00:02:53,735 --> 00:02:54,702
REACHED OUT.

93
00:02:54,702 --> 00:02:55,837
THE POLLS CLOSE IN LESS THAN TWO

94
00:02:55,837 --> 00:00:00,000
HOURS AND THE RESULTS TONIGHT
