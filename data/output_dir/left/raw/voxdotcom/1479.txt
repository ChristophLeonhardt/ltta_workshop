1
00:00:01,500 --> 00:00:04,480
The virtual yellow line in NFL broadcasts
is great.

2
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:08,230
It tells viewers how far the offense needs
to advance for a first down.

3
00:00:08,230 --> 00:00:16,670
It looks really simple and elegant but creating
that line was a massive engineering challenge.

4
00:00:16,670 --> 00:00:22,670
It started in the mid 90s when the Fox Sports
network tried to make hockey easier to watch.

5
00:00:22,670 --> 00:00:27,199
“Scientists at Fox Sports laboratories
are working on new technology.”

6
00:00:27,199 --> 00:00:30,979
"You won't believe your eyes."

7
00:00:30,980 --> 00:00:35,480
They embedded infrared transmitters inside
the puck and placed sensors around the rink,

8
00:00:35,480 --> 00:00:40,890
So that live tv viewers saw a blue glow around
the puck at all times and a red comet tail

9
00:00:40,890 --> 00:00:46,640
if it traveled over 70 miles per hour.
Hockey fans didn’t really embrace “glow

10
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:50,890
puck” as it came to be known.
So the technology was retired when the broadcasting

11
00:00:50,890 --> 00:00:54,039
rights for hockey switched to ABC a few years
later.

12
00:00:54,039 --> 00:00:58,120
But the team of engineers they had assembled
for the project was just getting started.

13
00:00:58,120 --> 00:01:01,640
They left Fox Sports to create a new company
called SportVision.

14
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:05,170
and in 1998, they debuted the “First and
Ten” line on ESPN.

15
00:01:05,170 --> 00:01:12,720
“Until now, this marker was
the only reference fans in the stadium and at home had

16
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:15,360
for the first down.”
The key challenge in making the yellow line

17
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:19,670
is that the scene is constantly changing,
which means the yellow line has to constantly

18
00:01:19,670 --> 00:01:22,520
change.
Not only are there 3 different cameras used

19
00:01:22,520 --> 00:01:27,900
for the wide shots of the field, each camera
pans, tilts and zooms to follow the action.

20
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:32,799
So the first thing Sportvision does before
the game is create a 3D mathematical model

21
00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:36,070
of each football field using laser surveying
tools.

22
00:01:36,070 --> 00:01:41,259
And during the game they gather data from
the cameras about their pan, tilt, and zoom positions

23
00:01:41,259 --> 00:01:44,950
for every single frame.
So when the operator specifies that the first

24
00:01:44,950 --> 00:01:49,860
down is at the 43rd yard line, for example,
the computers combine the camera data with

25
00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:53,960
their own model of the field to draw the yellow
line in the proper perspective

26
00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:58,399
..and to redraw it, for every frame being
broadcast to viewers.

27
00:01:58,399 --> 00:02:03,619
The final step is what makes the line kind of magical
-- removing any part of the line obstructed

28
00:02:03,619 --> 00:02:07,950
by players, refs or the ball so that the line
looks like it’s underneath them, almost

29
00:02:07,950 --> 00:02:11,280
painted on the field.
The way the computers know which pixels to

30
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:15,780
remove is by sampling the colors - think of
the field as a giant green screen.

31
00:02:15,780 --> 00:02:19,819
But anyone who has worked with green or blue
screens knows that you need a really uniform

32
00:02:19,819 --> 00:02:24,840
and evenly lit background for it to work well.
So Sportvision identifies in advance which

33
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:29,370
shades of green and brown are in the field
given the lighting conditions -- those are

34
00:02:29,370 --> 00:02:33,129
the colors to be covered by the yellow line.
And they identify which colors are in the

35
00:02:33,129 --> 00:02:35,940
players uniforms and should never be covered
by yellow.

36
00:02:35,940 --> 00:02:41,590
It works amazingly well. Here’s the Packers,
wearing green, in the rain. No problem.

37
00:02:41,590 --> 00:02:46,340
It only fails in the most extreme weather,
like this 2013 game in Philly. The line ends

38
00:02:46,340 --> 00:02:50,430
up all over players, but on the other hand
the system was helpfully used to insert the

39
00:02:50,430 --> 00:02:53,730
yardage numbers that had been covered up with
snow.

40
00:02:53,730 --> 00:02:57,680
The whole yellow line process delays the live
broadcast by less than a second.

41
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:02,590
And not surprisingly, it was an immediate
success. Sportvision won an Emmy for it,

42
00:03:02,590 --> 00:03:08,980
and went on to make virtual visual aids for
NASCAR, baseball, sailing and the Olympics.

43
00:03:08,980 --> 00:03:13,870
And football broadcasts have since added more
graphics, like the line of scrimmage and perhaps

44
00:03:13,870 --> 00:03:18,629
unnecessary large arrows showing the same
information that’s in the scorebox.

45
00:03:18,629 --> 00:03:23,390
But if that’s annoying consider this:
This type of technology is being used insert

46
00:03:23,390 --> 00:03:27,819
ads into stadiums and onto fields for a lot
of sports broadcasts.

47
00:03:27,819 --> 00:03:32,970
But the NFL doesn’t allow it. In the grand
tradition of the yellow line, the graphics

48
00:03:32,970 --> 00:00:00,000
on the field are not there to sell you things,
but to help you follow the game.
