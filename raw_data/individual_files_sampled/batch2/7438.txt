two well known online personalities diamond and silk who might be known as Lynette Hardaway and Rochelle Richardson they're sisters they used to be small-town ex Democrats that they found famous warriors for Trump they recently testified before Congress under oath I may add about Facebook and where conservatives stand on that platform because many Republican lawmakers personalities feel like they are being discriminated against on the social platforms that tend to lean left being from Silicon Valley some have spoken out about it including senator Ted Cruz who claimed Facebook blocked Trump supporters diamond and sales page with 1.2 million followers representative Joe Barton from Texas said why is Facebook censoring conservative bloggers such as diamond and silk and diamond and silk we're not having it when they went to go see Congress representatives about this you ladies are very impressive to me you you have taken something and you have moved forward with it exercising your First Amendment rights and you've made a ton of money off of Facebook in that correct absolutely not because Facebook Donald Trump reduced you all that a rally last year and he introduced y'all saying that you were very popular and you had made a ton of money based on your affiliation with him in that correct let me tell you what he was he was calling those things that was not as though they were is what he was doing then but let me tell you something he was giving but Facebook that's for six months it goes on tonight can I just jump it for a second sure now later Kim is gonna give you the details on you know how they're getting funded and outright lies that they've told but I do really appreciate her fire and passion I mean I don't agree with her and again there were some Lies told there but I don't know I thing appeals to me in that form of communicating well I'll just interject this one thing when they started diamond and silk I had them on my podcast I we checked in with them every other week because they have that they have that what you're talking about this charismatic dynamic they're kind of the greatest show on earth sort of for when when they're talking the problem is they became very powerful and very influential and their message is pretty toxic well it's influenced by well you'll you'll know in just a second soak em take it away well what I want to get to is the idea that conservatives are being throttled or censored on social media that they're not getting the reach that they should be getting and that's a fallacy that is not happening I have some data comes from crowd tangle it's a social media analytics program for Facebook it is owned by Facebook what you're looking at here is the total interactions for a diamond and silk on in March of 2018 you can see when that's when they were allegedly getting censored is when they got very high engagement much higher than they had gotten a year prior once you compare it to let's say liberal-leaning content on the next slide including the young turks on there it's consistent if not better in a lot of cases their engagement at least so and Mike really got hurt yo Mike took a dive yeah I'm sorry about that but that's a little tangental in particular if you single out the Rachel Maddow Show which is the most popular cable news program on the next slide so her video views went from 6 million to 1.2 million while diamond and silks went from 4.1 million to 1.8 million they both went down though you will notice the percentage is much higher for Rachel Maddow's and diamond and silk are beating Rachel Maddow show right now so the data doesn't support what they're saying is happening at all they're actually doing as good or if not better mm-hmm in the time that they said they were being censored or throttled or held back so I kind of it just feels like it feeds into this idea that Republicans feel like that they're conservatives feel like their victim so everyone is against them and bringing them down and nothing is their fault and weird well the thing that I will say is you know the squeaky wheel gets the attention and getting the attention means that you will drive more traffic to your page and that's exactly what happened here and their page was already doing well and by the way I wouldn't want anyone to be censored uh but the truth is anyone who does any type of political commentary on Facebook right now is getting hurt and getting hurt badly and it and its algorithm changes and as you could see from that data negatively impacted us as well and you just don't hear as many people on the left you know yelling and that ringing about it and so they got a lot of you know positive attention if they drove up traffic on their page it is what it is but you know the victimhood thing does get tiresome and and frustrating I mean what's happening across the board is broader shifts and Facebook yes if you have some kind of Facebook page for anything not just politics or news you may have noticed a drastic shift recently that is happening to everyone though most people aren't claiming it's a personal attack on them and their views right this is more single so so where do they get their funding from because that's actually something that recently I know you're excited I am I'm super it's not that I'm excited it's look it's not that I'm excited it's that recently when we were talking about another another conservative african-american woman who used to be very liberal I made the argument that it seems as though there are corrupting factors at play because it's weird to go make a complete 180 out of nowhere and go from being I'm super liberal left-leaning to all of a sudden I love Trump I'm gonna campaign for Trump and it's not just Trump related things it's you know going from saying things that point to the injustice is that your community is facing to all of a sudden now you're talking about how black people need to stop crying because they're in a privileged position I mean that is such a complete 180 so again I'm a the point that I believe and again it is my speculation that there might be corrupting factors there might be some you know some there might be money at play well and totally like oh that's a racist thing to say no I think that there might be some some data to back it up so Kim take it away what's funny is that you said the very liberal part oh yeah they were actually complaining that Facebook had labeled them as very liberal on their pages and they couldn't it was impossible to change it is possible to change I have changed mine several times that's also not true so they were under fire but about where they were getting their money and they said again and again and again no I'm not we're not taking Trump's money Trump never paid us we never took money however some filings from the FEC the Federal Election Commission say otherwise they did receive one thousand two hundred and seventy four dollars from Donald J Trump for president Inc they did say after being reminded that they were under oath that that was reimbursement for travel but let's look at the other two entries on that FEC filing volunteers for Nealon while in tears for Nealon seven thousand dollars who is Nealon you may remember recently that this candidate was running against or for paul ryan's seat Speaker Paul Ryan seat and it recently came out that he is a white nationalist yeah yeah okay that's it that's all that's all I we wanted you guys to know just a little bit of information for you you just watch the video by
