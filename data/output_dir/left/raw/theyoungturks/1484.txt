1
00:00:00,130 --> 00:00:04,120
RECENTLY DONALD TRUMP WAS
RALLYING FOR CANDIDATE MARSHA

2
00:00:04,120 --> 00:00:05,770
BLACKBURN.

3
00:00:05,770 --> 00:00:09,040
THIS WAS IN NASHVILLE AND DURING
THE RALLY HE SPECIFICALLY

4
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:13,470
BROUGHT UP THE ISSUE OF AN FBI
INFORMANT INFILTRATING HIS

5
00:00:13,470 --> 00:00:16,100
2016 PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN.

6
00:00:16,100 --> 00:00:19,259
JUST TO REMIND YOU GUYS AND
GIVE YOU CONTEXT INTO THAT

7
00:00:19,259 --> 00:00:20,630
INFILTRATOR.

8
00:00:20,630 --> 00:00:24,909
IT OCCURRED AFTER A FEW MEMBERS
OF TRUMP'S CAMPAIGN HAD

9
00:00:24,909 --> 00:00:28,849
PUBLICLY SPOKEN ABOUT THEIR TIES
TO RUSSIA.

10
00:00:28,849 --> 00:00:31,730
GEORGE PAPADOPOULOS IS A PRIMARY
EXAMPLE.

11
00:00:31,730 --> 00:00:36,300
HE SPOKE TO AN OFFICIAL FROM
AUSTRALIA ABOUT HOW HE WAS

12
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:39,230
IN COMMUNICATION WITH THE
RUSSIANS.

13
00:00:39,230 --> 00:00:46,870
THAT TIPPED OFF THE FBI AND THEY
DECIDED TO HIRE A REPUBLICAN

14
00:00:46,870 --> 00:00:51,180
INFORMANT TO SEE IF THOSE
ALLEGATIONS OF

15
00:00:51,180 --> 00:00:53,850
COMMUNICATIONS WITH RUSSIANS
WERE TRUE.

16
00:00:53,850 --> 00:00:57,790
WITH THAT SAID, HERE IS TRUMP
LOSING HIS MIND OVER IT

17
00:00:57,790 --> 00:01:00,350
AGAIN DURING THIS RALLY FOR
MARSHA.

18
00:01:00,350 --> 00:01:04,559
THEY HAVE PEOPLE INFILTRATING
OUR CAMPAIGN.

19
00:01:04,559 --> 00:01:08,210
CAN YOU IMAGINE?

20
00:01:08,210 --> 00:01:13,390
OKAY, SO I GIVE YOU THAT
LEAD-IN TO TALK ABOUT TREY

21
00:01:13,390 --> 00:01:14,390
GOWDY, HE

22
00:01:14,390 --> 00:01:18,000
IS THE REPUBLICAN REPRESENTATIVE
FROM SOUTH CAROLINA WHO WAS

23
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:23,200
RECENTLY ON CBS THIS MORNING TO
DISCUSS THIS VERY ISSUE.

24
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:25,700
GUESS WHAT HE DID?

25
00:01:25,700 --> 00:01:30,399
HE WENT
AGAINST WHAT TRUMP SAID.

26
00:01:30,399 --> 00:01:31,399
WATCH.

27
00:01:31,399 --> 00:01:36,090
YOU SAID I AM EVEN MORE
CONVINCED THAT THE FBI DID

28
00:01:36,090 --> 00:01:39,490
EXACTLY WHAT AMERICANS WOULD
WANT THEM TO DO WHEN THEY

29
00:01:39,490 --> 00:01:41,929
GOT THE INFORMATION THEY DID.

30
00:01:41,929 --> 00:01:43,960
HOW CAN YOU BE SO SURE?

31
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:48,149
WHEN THE FBI COMES INTO
CONTACT WITH INFORMATION ABOUT

32
00:01:48,149 --> 00:01:51,400
WHAT A FOREIGN GOVERNMENT MAY BE
DOING IN OUR ELECTION CYCLE I

33
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:53,619
THINK THEY HAVE AN OBLIGATION TO
RUN IT OUT.

34
00:01:53,619 --> 00:01:56,259
I THINK THE FBI, IF THEY WERE AT
THE TABLE THIS MORNING THEY

35
00:01:56,259 --> 00:01:59,170
WOULD TELL YOU RUSSIA WAS THE
TARGET AND RUSSIA'S

36
00:01:59,170 --> 00:02:02,090
INTENTIONS TOWARD OUR COUNTRY
WHERE THE TARGET.

37
00:02:02,090 --> 00:02:06,349
THE FACT THAT TWO PEOPLE WHO
WERE LOOSELY CONNECTED WITH THE

38
00:02:06,349 --> 00:02:10,590
TRUMP CAMPAIGN MAY HAVE BEEN
INVOLVED DOESN'T DIMINISH THE

39
00:02:10,590 --> 00:02:15,970
FACT THAT RUSSIA WAS THE TARGET
AND NOT THE CAMPAIGN.

40
00:02:15,970 --> 00:02:20,380
FIRST OF ALL, I LOVE THE WAY
CHUCK GOES TO A RALLY AND SAYS

41
00:02:20,380 --> 00:02:23,190
CAN YOU BELIEVE THE FBI WAS
INVESTIGATING ME?

42
00:02:23,190 --> 00:02:24,190
NORMALLY YOU

43
00:02:24,190 --> 00:02:32,890
SHOULD NOT REALLY BRAG ABOUT
THAT.

44
00:02:32,890 --> 00:02:33,890
ACTUALLY

45
00:02:33,890 --> 00:02:36,610
IT IS A SMART STRATEGY BY
TRUMP BECAUSE IT RILES THE

46
00:02:36,610 --> 00:02:39,110
REPUBLICAN BASE UP, THEY THINK
THERE IS A WITCHHUNT OR AN

47
00:02:39,110 --> 00:02:41,790
ATTACK AGAINST TRUMP BECAUSE
PEOPLE JUST DON'T LIKE HIM.

48
00:02:41,790 --> 00:02:45,760
BUT IN REALITY WHEN IT CAME TO
THIS FBI INFORMANT TRUMP HIMSELF

49
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:47,960
WAS NOT THE ONE BEING
INVESTIGATED THAT IT WAS THE

50
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:51,310
KNUCKLEHEADS IN HIS CAMPAIGN
THAT KEPT TALKING ABOUT HOW

51
00:02:51,310 --> 00:02:53,430
THEY WERE COMMUNICATING WITH THE
RUSSIANS.

52
00:02:53,430 --> 00:02:56,780
THOSE ARE THE PEOPLE THAT ARE
BEING INVESTIGATED.

53
00:02:56,780 --> 00:03:02,170
HE REFERRED TO THEM AND SAID
IF YOU REMEMBER TRUMP ONCE SAID

54
00:03:02,170 --> 00:03:07,900
THAT IF I WAS DOING ANYTHING
WRONG I DO WANT THE FBI TO

55
00:03:07,900 --> 00:03:11,260
LOOK INTO IT TO PROVE I WASN'T
INVOLVED.

56
00:03:11,260 --> 00:03:17,660
SO WHAT HAPPENED TO THAT?

57
00:03:17,660 --> 00:03:19,910
ANOTHER TIME TRUMP POSITIVELY

58
00:03:19,910 --> 00:03:25,780
TWEETED ABOUT SOMETHING HE HAD
SAID ñ OVER THE LAST 24 HOURS.

59
00:03:25,780 --> 00:03:29,190
THERE IS NO STRATEGY, HE IS JUST
NOT THAT BRIGHT.

60
00:03:29,190 --> 00:03:36,100
HE IS A DEEP WAY WHEN YOU'RE, HE
IS THE ONE BUT LET ALL THE

61
00:03:36,100 --> 00:03:42,290
NONSENSE BENGHAZI INVESTIGATION
ñ BUT HE IS NOW RETIRING SO IT

62
00:03:42,290 --> 00:03:46,490
FREES THEM UP A LITTLE BIT TO BE
10% MORE SANE THAN THE AVERAGE

63
00:03:46,490 --> 00:03:52,250
REPUBLICAN BEAR.

64
00:03:52,250 --> 00:03:59,520
SOMEBODY TOLD HIM THAT HE IS
ILLEGALLY TALKING TO

65
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:01,000
FOREIGN COUNTRIES.

66
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:07,220
AND HE SAYS WHAT DO YOU WANT THE
FBI TO DO?

67
00:04:07,220 --> 00:04:10,710
TRUMP SAID WHAT HE WANTED
THEM TO DO ñ IF ANYONE IS

68
00:04:10,710 --> 00:04:14,100
IN TALKS WITH THE RUSSIANS THEY
SHOULD BE INVESTIGATED.

69
00:04:14,100 --> 00:04:15,490
THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENED.

70
00:04:15,490 --> 00:04:18,149
NOW TRUMP IS BEING SEEN AS
THOUGH HE IS THE ONE BEING

71
00:04:18,149 --> 00:04:21,988
TARGETED FOR POLITICAL REASONS.

72
00:04:21,988 --> 00:04:27,240
THE NARRATIVE THAT TRUMP KEEPS
LAYING OUT INCLUDES WORDS LIKE

73
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:32,440
FBI SPY AND THAT IS AN ISSUE AS
WELL BECAUSE THIS INDIVIDUAL IS

74
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:36,540
NOT AN FBI SPY, HE IS AN
INFORMANT.

75
00:04:36,540 --> 00:04:38,270
YOU CAN SAY HE WAS AN
INFILTRATOR.

76
00:04:38,270 --> 00:04:42,070
BUT TO SAY HE WAS A SPY IS
PROBLEMATIC AND HE TOUCHES

77
00:04:42,070 --> 00:04:43,380
ON THAT IN THE NEXT CLIP.

78
00:04:43,380 --> 00:04:45,580
LET ME ASK YOU SPECIFIC
QUESTIONS.

79
00:04:45,580 --> 00:04:46,990
WAS THERE A SPY?

80
00:04:46,990 --> 00:04:47,990
THAT

81
00:04:47,990 --> 00:04:50,350
IS NOT A TERM I'VE EVER USED IN
THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM.

82
00:04:50,350 --> 00:04:52,301
UNDERCOVER, CONFIDENTIAL
INFORMANT ñ

83
00:04:52,301 --> 00:04:54,190
THOSE WORDS I'M UNFAMILIAR WITH.

84
00:04:54,190 --> 00:04:55,669
NEVER USED THE TERM SPY.

85
00:04:55,669 --> 00:04:58,410
WHEN THE PRESIDENT USES THE
TERM SPIKY, THERE WAS NO

86
00:04:58,410 --> 00:05:01,020
SPY INSERTED INTO THE CAMPAIGN?

87
00:05:01,020 --> 00:05:02,020
HAVE YOU SEEN EVIDENCE?

88
00:05:02,020 --> 00:05:06,270
NO, THAT IS AN ESPIONAGE
TERM NOT A LAW ENFORCEMENT TERM.

89
00:05:06,270 --> 00:05:09,950
YOU BELIEVE THE FBI ACTED
PROPERLY?

90
00:05:09,950 --> 00:05:12,780
I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE FBI
COULD'VE DONE OR SHOULD HAVE

91
00:05:12,780 --> 00:05:18,460
DONE OTHER THAN RUN OUT A LEAD
THAT SOMEONE LOOSELY CONNECTED

92
00:05:18,460 --> 00:05:21,790
WITH THE CAMPAIGN WAS MAKING
ASSERTIONS ABOUT RUSSIA.

93
00:05:21,790 --> 00:05:24,831
I WOULD THINK YOU WOULD WANT THE
FBI TO FIND OUT WHETHER OR

94
00:05:24,831 --> 00:05:28,170
NOT THERE WAS ANY VALIDITY TO
WHAT THOSE PEOPLE WERE SAYING.

95
00:05:28,170 --> 00:05:30,340
THAT IS NOT A DEMOCRATIC
CONGRESSMAN.

96
00:05:30,340 --> 00:05:33,590
THAT IS A REPUBLICAN CONGRESSMAN
WHO IS A PARTY LOYALIST AND

97
00:05:33,590 --> 00:05:36,889
DEEPLY RIGHT-WING FROM SOUTH
CAROLINA.

98
00:05:36,889 --> 00:05:38,510
HE WORKED IN LAW ENFORCEMENT.

99
00:05:38,510 --> 00:05:43,080
WHAT DO YOU WANT HIM TO DO?

100
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:46,270
AND
WHY DON'T YOU WANT HIM TO

101
00:05:46,270 --> 00:05:48,410
INVESTIGATE IT?

102
00:05:48,410 --> 00:05:51,480
WHEN ONE COUNTRY
SPIES AND ON ANOTHER COUNTRY ñ

103
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:55,580
TO USE IT WITHIN THE SAME
COUNTRY IN A SITUATION WHERE

104
00:05:55,580 --> 00:05:58,510
THERE IS A LAW ENFORCEMENT
MATTER MAKES NO SENSE ON TWO

105
00:05:58,510 --> 00:06:00,310
DIFFERENT GROUNDS.

106
00:06:00,310 --> 00:06:06,490
HE IS TRYING TO EXPLAIN IT IS AN
INFORMANT.

107
00:06:06,490 --> 00:06:11,620
YOU MIGHT USE IT IN A GANG OR
BOMB SITUATION.

108
00:06:11,620 --> 00:06:15,310
HERE THERE WERE ALLEGATIONS THAT
A FOREIGN COUNTRY WAS TRYING TO

109
00:06:15,310 --> 00:06:21,540
INFLUENCE A CAMPAIGN, WHICH
WOULD BE ILLEGAL.

110
00:06:21,540 --> 00:06:22,790
LAW ENFORCEMENT 101.

111
00:06:22,790 --> 00:06:34,980
IT IS NOT BRINGING IN A SPY FROM
SWEDEN.

112
00:06:34,980 --> 00:06:38,830
IT IS JUST REGULAR LAW
ENFORCEMENT.

113
00:06:38,830 --> 00:06:42,920
THAT IS A FUNNY IMAGE BUT I
JUST HAD IN MY HEAD.

114
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:45,740
ONE OTHER THING THAT REALLY
STOOD OUT TO ME ABOUT THIS

115
00:06:45,740 --> 00:06:48,290
INTERVIEW IS SOMETHING THAT YOU
TOUCHED ON EARLIER.

116
00:06:48,290 --> 00:06:52,580
HE WILL NOT BE SEEKING
REELECTION, HE IS RETIRING.

117
00:06:52,580 --> 00:06:57,700
AS SOON AS REPUBLICAN
POLITICIANS HAVE THAT TINY TASTE

118
00:06:57,700 --> 00:07:01,380
OF FREEDOM THEY DO SPEAK OUT
AGAINST TRUMP, MAYBE IT IS NOT

119
00:07:01,380 --> 00:07:04,740
AS AGGRESSIVELY AS SOME OF US
WOULD HOPE BUT HE IS

120
00:07:04,740 --> 00:07:09,180
CONTRADICTING WHAT TRUMP IS
SAYING.

121
00:07:09,180 --> 00:07:16,430
I AM CURIOUS TO SEE HOW
REPUBLICANS WHO ARE CURRENTLY IN

122
00:07:16,430 --> 00:07:21,350
OFFICE WILL BEHAVE AS SOON AS
TRUMP IS BAD FOR THEIR POLL

123
00:07:21,350 --> 00:07:23,650
NUMBERS.

124
00:07:23,650 --> 00:07:25,730
AND HOW QUICKLY THEY WILL TURN
ON HIM.

125
00:07:25,730 --> 00:07:29,070
WE ALL KNOW WHAT THEY GENUINELY
THINK ABOUT HIM.

126
00:07:29,070 --> 00:07:31,540
DIDN'T I TELL YOU GUYS.

127
00:07:31,540 --> 00:07:34,100
POLITICIANS ARE ñ

128
00:07:34,100 --> 00:07:36,060
DIRTY.

129
00:07:36,060 --> 00:07:38,030
YES.

130
00:07:38,030 --> 00:07:41,710
YOU CAN LITERALLY SEE THEM
REACTING TO TRUMP'S POLL NUMBERS

131
00:07:41,710 --> 00:07:44,419
BY HOW MUCH THEY ARE CRITICIZING
HIM.

132
00:07:44,419 --> 00:07:46,400
DEMOCRATS CRITICIZE THEM NO
MATTER WHAT UP FOR THE

133
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:49,690
REPUBLICANS NOW TRUMP'S POLL
NUMBERS ARE UP A LITTLE BIT SO

134
00:07:49,690 --> 00:07:52,020
THE ONES THAT ARE NOT RETIRING
OR LIKE WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

135
00:07:52,020 --> 00:07:56,080
OF COURSE MAYBE THERE COULD BE
SPIES ALL OVER THE GOVERNMENT

136
00:07:56,080 --> 00:08:00,990
AND THE DEEP STATE COULD BE
FIXING THE MIDTERM ELECTIONS.

137
00:08:00,990 --> 00:08:04,620
BUT MEANWHILE WHEN HIS MEMBERS
THINK THEY ARE LIKE WELL, I

138
00:08:04,620 --> 00:08:09,270
WOULD NOT SAY IT THAT WAY.

139
00:08:09,270 --> 00:08:13,139
AS WE GET CLOSER TO ELECTIONS,
IT REALLY DEPENDS ON TRUMP'S

140
00:08:13,139 --> 00:08:17,230
POLL NUMBERS BECAUSE POLITICIANS
ARE NOT PEOPLE THAT ARE VERY

141
00:08:17,230 --> 00:08:23,830
COURAGEOUS
DOW THERE ARE NOT LEADERS, 999

142
00:08:23,830 --> 00:08:33,559
9999 OUT OF 90 AND HAVE THEIR
FOLLOWERS.

143
00:08:33,559 --> 00:08:34,559
FOR A GUY LIKE

144
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:37,829
DOUGHTY ON HIS WAY OUT HE IS
LIKE NO I AM NOT GOING TO AGREE

145
00:08:37,830 --> 00:08:42,640
TO AN INSANE CONSPIRACY ABOUT
HOW THE FBI HAS SPIES AND THE

146
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:47,790
LATEST THING TRUMP SAID IS THEY
ARE GOING TO FIX THE ELECTION.

147
00:08:47,790 --> 00:08:52,790
ANYONE WHO BELIEVES THAT HAS
TOTALLY LOST THEIR MINDS OR

148
00:08:52,790 --> 00:08:55,460
IS LYING ON PURPOSE FOR
POLITICAL REASONS.

149
00:08:55,460 --> 00:08:58,430
HE JUST DOESN'T HAVE AS MUCH OF
A REASON TO ANYMORE.

150
00:08:58,430 --> 00:08:59,430
IF

151
00:08:59,430 --> 00:09:03,370
YOU ARE LYING ABOUT HOW THERE
COULD POTENTIALLY BE MEDDLING

152
00:09:03,370 --> 00:09:06,380
IN THE MIDTERM ELECTIONS TO
SCREW OVER REPUBLICANS SO

153
00:09:06,380 --> 00:09:10,070
YOU CAN HELP YOUR POLL NUMBERS,
YOU ARE A BAD PERSON.

154
00:09:10,070 --> 00:09:14,390
THAT COULD LEAD TO A DANGEROUS
RESULT.

155
00:09:14,390 --> 00:09:20,570
PEOPLE WHO SEE THAT MAYBE IN
SOME SEATS DEMOCRATS WILL

156
00:09:20,570 --> 00:09:22,250
THINK THERE WAS MEDDLING
INVOLVED THERE.

157
00:09:22,250 --> 00:09:23,410
IT IS DANGEROUS.

158
00:09:23,410 --> 00:09:26,240
IF YOU ARE A POLITICIAN WHO IS
PLAYING INTO THAT RIDICULOUS

159
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:31,089
NARRATIVE UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU
ARE DOING TO THE FUTURE OF THE

160
00:09:31,089 --> 00:09:32,089
COUNTRY.

161
00:09:32,089 --> 00:09:34,710
THEY KNOW THAT THEY ARE
UNDERMINING THE FORM OF

162
00:09:34,710 --> 00:09:36,050
GOVERNMENT AND OUR DEMOCRACY.

163
00:09:36,050 --> 00:09:39,700
THAT IS WHY IT DRIVES ME CRAZY
WHEN TV KISSES THE ASS OF

164
00:09:39,700 --> 00:09:44,839
THESE POLITICIANS.

165
00:09:44,839 --> 00:09:48,810
THEY DON'T
BELIEVE ANYTHING.

166
00:09:48,810 --> 00:09:51,410
THEY BELIEVE IN GETTING
REELECTED IN FINDING OUT

167
00:09:51,410 --> 00:09:53,360
WHAT THEIR DONORS WANT AND
SERVING IT.

168
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:56,980
THEY ARE NOW HONORABLE PEOPLE.

169
00:09:56,980 --> 00:09:58,529
THEY CARE ONLY ABOUT THEMSELVES.

170
00:09:58,529 --> 00:10:02,300
IT IS GOOD REASON WHY THE
COUNTRY DISGUISES POLITICIANS.

171
00:10:02,300 --> 00:10:05,340
THE POLLING SOMETIMES AS LOW AS
7%.

172
00:10:05,340 --> 00:10:09,149
THE BRITISH GOVERNMENT WHEN WE
DID A REVOLUTION AGAINST THEM

173
00:10:09,149 --> 00:10:13,050
HAD A ONE THIRD OF THE COLONY
SUPPORTING THEM.

174
00:10:13,050 --> 00:10:15,040
CONGRESS IS IN WAY WERE SHAPED.

175
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:17,520
THE ONLY PEOPLE WHO SUPPORT
CONGRESSMAN TODAY ARE THE

176
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:18,520
PEOPLE ON TV.

177
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:20,210
THEY ARE EMPOWERED TOGETHER.

178
00:10:20,210 --> 00:10:24,650
AND YOU CAN TELL AS A
CONGRESSMAN IS LEAVING FINALLY A

179
00:10:24,650 --> 00:10:27,640
LITTLE BIT OF HONESTY WHICH
GIVES YOU A SENSE OF THE

180
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:32,780
MOUNTAIN OF DISHONESTY THAT
NORMALLY THESE POLITICIANS LIVE

181
00:10:32,780 --> 00:00:00,000
IN, BUT YOUR TV HOST NEVER
POINTS OUT.
