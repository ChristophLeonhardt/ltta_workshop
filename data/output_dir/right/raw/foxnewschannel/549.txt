1
00:00:01,189 --> 00:00:01,957
ARE, CASTRATION.

2
00:00:01,957 --> 00:00:03,592
MEDIEVAL MOMENTS CALL FOR

3
00:00:03,592 --> 00:00:04,426
MEDIEVAL REMEDIES AND THIS IS

4
00:00:04,426 --> 00:00:09,832
DEFINITELY A MEETING OF.

5
00:00:09,832 --> 00:00:18,440
SO ETHAN, ARE YOU COMFORTABLE

6
00:00:18,440 --> 00:00:21,577
WITH THIS AND ARE YOU

7
00:00:21,577 --> 00:00:23,245
COMFORTABLE THAT ONCE YOU ARE

8
00:00:23,245 --> 00:00:26,115
ACCUSED OF SOMETHING, YOU SHOULD

9
00:00:26,115 --> 00:00:27,116
BE THE ONE TO DISPROVE THE

10
00:00:27,116 --> 00:00:28,317
ACCUSATION AND IT'S UP TO YOU TO

11
00:00:28,317 --> 00:00:29,685
PROVE WHAT YOU ARE SAYING ABOUT

12
00:00:29,685 --> 00:00:32,720
YOU ISN'T TRUE.

13
00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:34,490
>> I THINK WHAT WE HAVE TO HAVE

14
00:00:34,490 --> 00:00:36,859
IS A HEARING OF BOTH SIDES, AND

15
00:00:36,859 --> 00:00:41,330
I THINK WE WILL HAVE THAT FROM

16
00:00:41,330 --> 00:00:46,034
DR. FORD.

17
00:00:46,034 --> 00:00:48,137
AND THAT'S THE SUPPOSE IT

18
00:00:48,137 --> 00:00:53,042
WITNESSES THAT HAVE OCCURRED.

19
00:00:53,042 --> 00:00:57,579
IT'S NOT UP TO PROCESS, THIS IS

20
00:00:57,579 --> 00:00:58,714
LIKE A JOB APPLICATION.

21
00:00:58,714 --> 00:01:00,916
>> HOLD ON, LET ME BACK UP.

22
00:01:00,916 --> 00:01:03,185
YOU ARE ARGUING SOMETHING

23
00:01:03,185 --> 00:01:04,387
PARALLEL TO WHAT I ASK YOU.

24
00:01:04,387 --> 00:01:12,561
I'M IN FAVOR OF ALL OF THAT, THE

25
00:01:12,561 --> 00:01:14,196
QUESTION IS WHAT DO WE MAKE OF

26
00:01:14,196 --> 00:01:16,899
YOUR PARTY LEADERS, MEMBERS OF

27
00:01:16,899 --> 00:01:24,140
THE JUDICIARY PARTY SAYING, WE

28
00:01:24,140 --> 00:01:25,674
HAVE AT LEAST THREE DEMOCRATIC

29
00:01:25,674 --> 00:01:26,275
MEMBERS OF THE JUDICIARY

30
00:01:26,275 --> 00:01:28,377
COMMITTEE SAYING THAT IN PLAIN

31
00:01:28,377 --> 00:01:29,111
INTRO, ENGLISH.

32
00:01:29,111 --> 00:01:30,379
PROVE YOU ARE NOT GUILTY, ARE

33
00:01:30,379 --> 00:01:32,848
YOU COMFORTABLE WITH THAT

34
00:01:32,848 --> 00:01:33,916
STANDARD THAT'S AN UN-AMERICAN

35
00:01:33,916 --> 00:01:34,316
STANDARD?

36
00:01:34,316 --> 00:01:35,685
WE'VE NEVER SEEN IT BEFORE AND

37
00:01:35,685 --> 00:01:36,219
IT'S HAPPENING NOW.

38
00:01:36,219 --> 00:01:39,121
I WANT TO KNOW WHAT YOU THINK OF

39
00:01:39,121 --> 00:01:39,388
IT.

40
00:01:39,388 --> 00:01:41,290
>> I'M NOT COMFORTABLE WITH THE

41
00:01:41,290 --> 00:01:42,959
SCENARIO, WHEN THEY SAY, PROVE

42
00:01:42,959 --> 00:01:44,327
YOU ARE NOT GUILTY.

43
00:01:44,327 --> 00:01:45,194
AND I'VE BEEN CONSISTENT ABOUT

44
00:01:45,194 --> 00:01:48,297
THIS THROUGHOUT THE ENTIRE ME

45
00:01:48,297 --> 00:01:48,764
TOO MOVEMENT.

46
00:01:48,764 --> 00:01:49,432
WHEN THERE IS SINGLE ACCUSER

47
00:01:49,432 --> 00:01:52,535
IT'S HARD FOR TO CALL FOR

48
00:01:52,535 --> 00:01:53,703
SOMEBODY'S JOB TO BE LOST.

49
00:01:53,703 --> 00:01:57,306
WHEN WE HAVE MULTIPLE ACCUSERS

50
00:01:57,306 --> 00:01:58,574
COMING FORWARD, PLUS MICHAEL

51
00:01:58,574 --> 00:01:59,909
AVENATTI IS TEASING ANOTHER ONE,

52
00:01:59,909 --> 00:02:02,178
THEN WE HAVE A PATTERN AND WE

53
00:02:02,178 --> 00:02:06,315
NEED TO LOOK VERY DEEPLY INTO

54
00:02:06,315 --> 00:02:06,616
THIS.

55
00:02:06,616 --> 00:02:07,550
>> Tucker: DOES IT OCCUR TO

56
00:02:07,550 --> 00:02:09,886
YOU THAT WE HAVE A PATTERN OF

57
00:02:09,886 --> 00:02:11,554
PEOPLE MAKING CHARGES THAT THEY

58
00:02:11,554 --> 00:02:13,155
CAN'T SUBSTANTIATE TO ACHIEVE

59
00:02:13,155 --> 00:02:14,323
POLITICAL ENDS?

60
00:02:14,323 --> 00:02:15,791
IS THAT A POSSIBLE EXPLANATION

61
00:02:15,791 --> 00:02:17,860
FOR THAT OR AM I A SEXIST FOR

62
00:02:17,860 --> 00:02:20,496
SUGGESTING THAT?

63
00:02:20,496 --> 00:02:23,666
>> WE HAVE TWO REALLY BIG

64
00:02:23,666 --> 00:02:24,000
ISSUES.

65
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:24,734
ONE, I DON'T LIKE THAT POLITICS

66
00:02:24,734 --> 00:02:26,302
IS THE BLOOD SPORT THAT IT IS

67
00:02:26,302 --> 00:02:26,602
TODAY.

68
00:02:26,602 --> 00:02:30,139
THE DEMOCRATS HAD ON THE LETTER,

69
00:02:30,139 --> 00:02:32,542
BUT POLITICS IS POLITICS.

70
00:02:32,542 --> 00:02:34,911
THEY SAT ON IT TO TRY TO DELAY

71
00:02:34,911 --> 00:02:35,178
IT.

72
00:02:35,178 --> 00:02:36,646
BUT WHAT'S HAPPENED NOW IS, WE

73
00:02:36,646 --> 00:02:39,415
HAVE WOMEN WHO ARE BEING SLAMMED

74
00:02:39,415 --> 00:02:42,652
AND SLANDERED, ATTACKED IN

75
00:02:42,652 --> 00:02:46,089
DISBELIEF AND IN THE MIDDLE OF

76
00:02:46,089 --> 00:02:49,526
THEM ME TOO MOVEMENT, IT'S TIME

77
00:02:49,526 --> 00:02:51,861
TO GET THEM THEIR DUE.

78
00:02:51,861 --> 00:02:52,929
>> Tucker: HOLD ON, IT'S NOT

79
00:02:52,929 --> 00:02:57,133
ABOUT ALL MEN AND ALL WOMEN.

80
00:02:57,133 --> 00:02:58,702
IT'S ABOUT BRETT KAVANAUGH AND

81
00:02:58,702 --> 00:02:59,703
CHRISTINE FLORIDA.

82
00:02:59,703 --> 00:03:00,704
THE CASE IS SPECIFIC.

83
00:03:00,704 --> 00:03:02,672
WE ARE NOT PUTTING MEN ON TRIAL

84
00:03:02,672 --> 00:03:04,007
OR TRYING TO EXONERATE WOMEN FOR

85
00:03:04,007 --> 00:03:05,141
THE CRIMES COMMITTED BY OUR

86
00:03:05,141 --> 00:03:09,646
ANCESTORS, WE ARE TALKING ABOUT

87
00:03:09,646 --> 00:03:11,181
THOSE IN THE SENATE JUDICIARY

88
00:03:11,181 --> 00:03:11,548
COMMITTEE.

89
00:03:11,548 --> 00:03:12,916
YOU ARE SUGGESTING THAT YOU ARE

90
00:03:12,916 --> 00:03:14,517
NOT ALLOWED TO JUST BELIEVE

91
00:03:14,517 --> 00:03:16,986
SOMEBODY BUT I RETAIN MY RIGHT

92
00:03:16,986 --> 00:03:25,528
OF REASON AND, SHE'S CLAIMING

93
00:03:25,528 --> 00:03:26,663
THAT THIS MAN SEXUALLY ASSAULTED

94
00:03:26,663 --> 00:03:28,498
HER AND ALTER THE CLOSE OF HER

95
00:03:28,498 --> 00:03:28,798
LIFE.

96
00:03:28,798 --> 00:03:31,067
SHE CAN'T FLY IN AIRPLANES, SHE

97
00:03:31,067 --> 00:03:31,901
CAN'T HAVE A RELATIONSHIP WITH

98
00:03:31,901 --> 00:03:35,572
MEN.

99
00:03:35,572 --> 00:03:37,474
SHE DIDN'T TELL ANYONE HIS NAME

100
00:03:37,474 --> 00:03:38,208
FOR 36 YEARS DURING WHICH TIME

101
00:03:38,208 --> 00:03:42,178
HE GOT MARRIED AND A CAREER.

102
00:03:42,178 --> 00:03:43,012
DOESN'T SHE HAVE AN OBLIGATION

103
00:03:43,012 --> 00:03:44,314
TO TELL SOMEONE TO STOP HIM FROM

104
00:03:44,314 --> 00:03:46,916
DOING THAT IF HE IS IN FACT A

105
00:03:46,916 --> 00:03:48,551
CRIMINAL?

106
00:03:48,551 --> 00:03:50,186
WHERE IS HER OBLIGATION HERE?

107
00:03:50,186 --> 00:03:51,187
>> EVERY PSYCHOLOGIST WILL TELL

108
00:03:51,187 --> 00:03:52,822
YOU THERE ARE EIGHT PRIMARY

109
00:03:52,822 --> 00:03:54,357
REASONS WHY A SEXUAL ASSAULT

110
00:03:54,357 --> 00:03:57,460
VICTIM, A TRAUMA NOT COME

111
00:03:57,460 --> 00:03:57,794
FORWARD.

112
00:03:57,794 --> 00:04:00,263
>> Tucker: I'M NOT ASKING

113
00:04:00,263 --> 00:04:03,500
ABOUT HER REASONS.

114
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:06,203
THE ODDS ARE 120 MILLION IN THE

115
00:04:06,203 --> 00:04:06,703
FIRST PLACE.

116
00:04:06,703 --> 00:04:08,071
IF HE'S ACTUALLY A CRIMINAL THEN

117
00:04:08,071 --> 00:04:10,106
WE HAVE A RIGHT TO KNOW THAT AND

118
00:04:10,106 --> 00:04:11,208
SHE HAS AN OBLIGATION TO TELL

119
00:04:11,208 --> 00:04:12,075
US.

120
00:04:12,075 --> 00:04:12,943
I KNOW IT'S HARD, BUT WHY

121
00:04:12,943 --> 00:04:15,278
DOESN'T SHE HAVE THE RIGHT TO

122
00:04:15,278 --> 00:04:16,313
KNOW?

123
00:04:16,313 --> 00:04:17,247
IF BERNIE MADE OFF RIPS YOU OFF

124
00:04:17,247 --> 00:04:19,082
AND YOU DON'T TELL HIS OTHER

125
00:04:19,082 --> 00:04:20,517
INVESTORS, YOU ARE PART OF THE

126
00:04:20,517 --> 00:04:24,922
PROBLEM, ARE YOU NOT?

127
00:04:24,922 --> 00:04:26,790
>> DR. FORD DID COMMUNICATE WITH

128
00:04:26,790 --> 00:04:30,027
HER THERAPIST.

129
00:04:30,027 --> 00:04:35,365
>> BUT SHE DIDN'T NAME HIM FOR A

130
00:04:35,365 --> 00:04:35,732
36 YEARS.

131
00:04:35,732 --> 00:04:38,068
I'M SAYING IF IT IS TRUE, WHAT'S

132
00:04:38,068 --> 00:04:38,502
GOING ON HERE?

133
00:04:38,502 --> 00:04:41,605
DON'T THE REST OF THE US HAVE A

134
00:04:41,605 --> 00:04:45,008
RIGHT TO PROTECT OURSELVES FROM

135
00:04:45,008 --> 00:04:45,642
THIS DANGEROUS MAN, BRETT

136
00:04:45,642 --> 00:04:47,778
KAVANAUGH?

137
00:04:47,778 --> 00:04:48,712
>> HANG ON.

138
00:04:48,712 --> 00:04:51,114
YOU HAVE A VERY POWERFUL PERSON

139
00:04:51,114 --> 00:04:52,616
HERE, A JUDGE ON THE

140
00:04:52,616 --> 00:04:55,085
NINTH CIRCUIT.

141
00:04:55,085 --> 00:05:00,223
>> TUCKER, YOU WERE JUST TALKING

142
00:05:00,223 --> 00:05:01,825
ABOUT THE PRIVILEGED ELITE AND

143
00:05:01,825 --> 00:05:03,493
THE WEALTHY AND THOSE IN POWER.

144
00:05:03,493 --> 00:05:05,662
THAT WAS BRETT KAVANAUGH FROM

145
00:05:05,662 --> 00:05:05,996
DAY ONE.

146
00:05:05,996 --> 00:05:15,072
HE WENT FROM AN ELITE SCHOOL,

147
00:05:15,072 --> 00:05:15,806
THAT'S CALLING FOR SOMETHING IS

148
00:05:15,806 --> 00:05:19,276
TO CHANGE.

149
00:05:19,276 --> 00:05:20,711
>> Tucker: IT YOU ARE

150
00:05:20,711 --> 00:05:21,712
INTENTIONALLY DODGING MY

151
00:05:21,712 --> 00:05:22,513
QUESTION.

152
00:05:22,513 --> 00:05:23,013
WHICH IS ABOUT THE

153
00:05:23,013 --> 00:05:24,715
RESPONSIBILITY TO PROTECT THE

154
00:05:24,715 --> 00:05:25,549
REST OF US.

155
00:05:25,549 --> 00:05:28,018
I THINK IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT HER,

156
00:05:28,018 --> 00:05:29,219
AND HER FEELINGS, YOUR

157
00:05:29,219 --> 00:05:31,488
RESPONSIBILITY TO OTHERS AROUND

158
00:05:31,488 --> 00:05:32,523
YOU AND A SOCIETY AT LARGE WHICH

159
00:05:32,523 --> 00:05:34,458
WE ARE IGNORING A PURPOSE

160
00:05:34,458 --> 00:05:35,225
BECAUSE WE ARE TERRIFIED TO SEE

161
00:05:35,225 --> 00:05:37,127
WHAT'S TRUE.

162
00:05:37,127 --> 00:05:42,266
LET ME ASK YOU REALLY QUICKLY

163
00:05:42,266 --> 00:05:43,567
ABOUT THE CREEPY LAWYER.

164
00:05:43,567 --> 00:05:45,903
ALL OF A SUDDEN, THIS GUY WHO

165
00:05:45,903 --> 00:05:46,937
WAS THE LAWYER FOR STORMY

166
00:05:46,937 --> 00:05:47,771
DANIELS JUMPS UP AND DOWN AND

167
00:05:47,771 --> 00:05:49,940
MAKES A SPECTACLE FOR HIMSELF,

168
00:05:49,940 --> 00:05:54,245
AND THE PRESS KIND OF ATTACKS

169
00:05:54,245 --> 00:05:58,949
THAT AND MAKES A JOKE.

170
00:05:58,949 --> 00:06:02,119
>> MICHAEL AVENATTI IS A BEAST.

171
00:06:02,119 --> 00:06:03,888
>> THAT IS TRUE.

172
00:06:03,888 --> 00:06:05,890
>> JON MEACHAM SAID HE MAY BE

173
00:06:05,890 --> 00:06:06,957
THE SAVIOR OF THE REPUBLIC.

174
00:06:06,957 --> 00:06:09,927
>> HE HAS A BIGGER CALLING HERE.

175
00:06:09,927 --> 00:06:13,230
THE PRIESTHOOD OR WHATEVER, HE'S

176
00:06:13,230 --> 00:06:15,900
OUT THERE SAVING THE COUNTRY.

177
00:06:15,900 --> 00:06:16,634
>> I OWE MICHAEL AVENATTI ON

178
00:06:16,634 --> 00:06:16,967
APOLOGY.

179
00:06:16,967 --> 00:06:19,136
THE LAST FEW WEEKS I'VE SAID IT,

180
00:06:19,136 --> 00:06:19,937
ENOUGH ALREADY.

181
00:06:19,937 --> 00:06:22,340
I WAS WRONG, YOU HAVE A LOT TO

182
00:06:22,340 --> 00:06:22,707
SAY.

183
00:06:22,707 --> 00:06:25,343
THE DEMOCRATS COULD LEARN

184
00:06:25,343 --> 00:06:25,910
SOMETHING FROM YOU.

185
00:06:25,910 --> 00:06:26,944
>> Tucker: SO THEY ARE

186
00:06:26,944 --> 00:06:28,246
PROMOTING HIM FROM THE VERY

187
00:06:28,246 --> 00:06:31,749
START, AND THAT WAS FINE.

188
00:06:31,749 --> 00:06:33,150
BUT THE PRESS IS NOW STARTING TO

189
00:06:33,150 --> 00:06:37,421
FALL FOR ITS OWN JOKE.

190
00:06:37,421 --> 00:06:39,423
TAKING CREEPY BORN LAWYER

191
00:06:39,423 --> 00:06:44,762
SERIOUSLY, AND, IT'S NOT ABOUT

192
00:06:44,762 --> 00:06:46,731
ONE SPECIFIC ALLEGATION, IT'S A

193
00:06:46,731 --> 00:06:48,466
SERIES OF ALLEGATIONS.

194
00:06:48,466 --> 00:06:51,102
THIS IS A PATTERN OF BEHAVIOR,

195
00:06:51,102 --> 00:06:53,204
RACHEL, THAT TOOK PLACE ACROSS

196
00:06:53,204 --> 00:06:55,139
MANY MONTHS AND MANY YEARS.

197
00:06:55,139 --> 00:06:56,541
I BELIEVE THAT WHEN THESE

198
00:06:56,541 --> 00:06:57,508
ALLEGATIONS ARE SURFACED WITHIN

199
00:06:57,508 --> 00:07:00,711
THE NEXT 48 HOURS, THERE WILL BE

200
00:07:00,711 --> 00:07:03,114
NO QUESTION THAT BRETT KAVANAUGH

201
00:07:03,114 --> 00:07:07,118
DOES NOT FIT TO SIT ON THE U.S.

202
00:07:07,118 --> 00:07:08,753
SUPREME COURT.

203
00:07:08,753 --> 00:07:10,354
>> HE HASN'T PROVIDED THE

204
00:07:10,354 --> 00:07:12,557
ALLEGATIONS NEEDLESS TO SAY.

205
00:07:12,557 --> 00:07:14,992
THIS GUY IS A BUFFOON.

206
00:07:14,992 --> 00:07:16,494
THE CONSEQUENCES ARE SERIOUS,

207
00:07:16,494 --> 00:07:17,228
WHY LET THIS CHARLATAN INTRUDE

208
00:07:17,228 --> 00:07:20,732
ON THE PROCESS?

209
00:07:20,732 --> 00:07:22,066
WHY ARE THEY ALLOWING HIM TO

210
00:07:22,066 --> 00:07:26,170
TAKE CENTER STAGE?

211
00:07:26,170 --> 00:07:28,273
>> MICHAEL AVENATTI IS TAKING A

212
00:07:28,273 --> 00:07:28,873
PAGE OUT OF TRUMP'S OWN

213
00:07:28,873 --> 00:07:29,540
PLAYBOOK.

214
00:07:29,540 --> 00:07:30,875
BUT HERE'S THE DIFFERENCE,

215
00:07:30,875 --> 00:07:32,310
MICHAEL AVENATTI HAS BROUGHT THE

216
00:07:32,310 --> 00:07:34,279
GOOD SINCE HE STARTED

217
00:07:34,279 --> 00:07:35,480
REPRESENTING THIS CLIFFORD,

218
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:40,285
STORMY DANIELS.

219
00:07:40,285 --> 00:07:42,287
BUT IN THIS SPECIFIC CASE, HE

220
00:07:42,287 --> 00:07:43,521
SUGGESTING -- HE HAS NOTHING TO

221
00:07:43,521 --> 00:07:44,656
DO WITH ANY OF THIS.

222
00:07:44,656 --> 00:07:47,726
HE SAYING THAT BRETT KAVANAUGH

223
00:07:47,726 --> 00:07:49,027
WAS PART OF A RATE RING.

224
00:07:49,027 --> 00:07:53,131
HE'S NOT GOING TO GET SUED FOR

225
00:07:53,131 --> 00:07:54,032
SLANDER, SO DO DEMOCRATS WANT TO

226
00:07:54,032 --> 00:07:57,068
BE TIED TO SOMEONE THAT

227
00:07:57,068 --> 00:07:57,435
RECKLESS?

228
00:07:57,435 --> 00:07:58,303
>> I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT

229
00:07:58,303 --> 00:08:02,073
THE ALLEGATION OF A RATE RING,

230
00:08:02,073 --> 00:08:04,542
BUT HE CLAIMS TO HAVE OUR VERY

231
00:08:04,542 --> 00:08:07,479
WELL THAT IT OUT RELIABLE

232
00:08:07,479 --> 00:08:07,812
ACCUSER.

233
00:08:07,812 --> 00:08:08,680
AND I'M VERY INTERESTED

234
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:10,549
COMPANIES TEASING IT OUT OVER 48

235
00:08:10,549 --> 00:08:11,250
HOURS, AND THAT TIME HASN'T

236
00:08:11,250 --> 00:08:13,952
QUITE MADE IT OUT YET.

237
00:08:13,952 --> 00:08:16,388
AGAIN, HE BROUGHT THE GOOD SINCE

238
00:08:16,388 --> 00:08:18,257
HE STARTED REPRESENTING STORMY

239
00:08:18,257 --> 00:08:18,857
DANIELS.

240
00:08:18,857 --> 00:08:21,126
>> HE CERTAINLY MADE SOME MONEY

241
00:08:21,126 --> 00:08:22,661
AS STORMY DANIELS IS GETTING

242
00:08:22,661 --> 00:00:00,000
BEER BOTTLES THROWN IN STRIP
