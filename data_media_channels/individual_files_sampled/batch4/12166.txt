speech to a Republican club around here I I was really upset because the the morning opened up with horseface you know I Lisa wakes up before I do sweet little ELISA so you know she's reading the news and she just wakes me up Mac Mac wake up horseface wake up you got a lot of news to read Mac so so let's see this the president called his former hooker a horse face specifically he tweeted out quote federal judge throws out stormy Daniels lawsuit versus Trump Trump is entitled to full legal fees at Fox News great now I can go after horse face and her third-rate lawyer in the great state of Texas she will confirm the letter she signed she knows nothing about me a total con horse face obviously referring to stormy Daniels I have the opposite reaction to this that I think virtually everyone else did so we'll get into why I think this was actually not a terrible political move in a second not exactly polite not exactly chivalrous but politically it actually might have been a smart move but first we're actually very fortunate to be joined now by stormy Daniels I think this is an exclusive on the Michael Knowles show to get Miz Daniels's reaction to the Trump tweet miss Daniels what what do you make of it and why did you start this fight with him you know this battle of names obviously you first called you called out president Trump for his genitalia and you put that in your book and that then he's responding to this why did you start that fight in the first place mmm-hmm understood that makes sense obviously if you publish a book with scintillating details about the shape of the president's member then you can fill up that feedback a little bit more make a little more money honey I totally understand that I totally understand that tendency let's not forget before we get into the rudeness of it all it's so rude it's so rude she did start this fight she did the president slept with this porn star allegedly in what 2006 something like that they have a one-night stand and then he offers her some money she doesn't take the money then before the election it seems that she blackmails the guy and he wants her to sign a nondisclosure agreement he pays her what wasn't a hundred thirty thousand hundred fifty thousand dollars to keep quiet money not very well spent because she didn't keep white it came out she started talking about it total violation of even the blackmail NDA that she had been pushing for all the money she received then she publishes this book says she publishes this book where she says president Trump's little little Donald Donald jr. and I'm not talking about his son resembles the mushroom character from Mario Kart and on and on what we know about Donald Trump is that he responds to every single attack any attack that you make on him he will return five times as hard doesn't matter if you're a man woman child you know anything he will hit back it doesn't matter if you are John McCain Pio w in Vietnam he hits back against anybody and she started the fight we saw this with the Rosie O'Donnell thing you know Rosie O'Donnell attacked Donald Trump Donald Trump was merciless and vicious toward her but she did start it so that's that's the first side of this now is it ever nice to say these things about women no is it ever nice to say these things about the hooker that you were sleeping with while your wife was pregnant no do I recommend that people do it no that said this stormy Daniels made this a political battle she decided to blackmail a presidential candidate she decided to violate her non-disclosure agreement he decided to try to attack the president in an election year in a midterm election year and so he's got to fight back I mean the reason we elected Donald Trump is because he fights back finally now I want to analyze this this language a little bit too because I think politically it was a good attack why the the kind of consensus conservative view is that this squandered all of the good news the good news is he won the defamation ruling the court threw out avenatti threw out stormy Daniels and gave a win to President Trump that's the good news and he's stepping on it by calling her horse face I don't think that's true I don't think anybody would report that he won that ruling that defamation ruling if he didn't make it saucy with something like horse face if he didn't we wouldn't be talking about it maybe on this show we would have mentioned it but it wouldn't have gotten any play in the media the reason it's getting play is cuz he called his former prostitute horse face and so everyone is running with that on NBC on the New York Times Washington Post all of that and then you have to ask well why did he call her horse face oh it was well he won that defamation ruling against her so I actually think politically it's pretty smart and I don't think that you need to be some conspiratorial mastermind 4d chess person to think so Donald Trump is a media manipulator that is essentially what this guy is he is has been doing it since the 1980s he is the greatest media manipulator of his age he's doing it again in this tweet he knows exactly what he's doing he knows exactly what effect the the words will have I'd also like to point out on the nickname itself it's a pun I don't think people have noticed this horseface to refer to his whore she's a she takes money to have sex with people so the horse fit she's saying her face looks like a horse and she's a whore and it's a horse face again I don't think this is conspiratorial he's really good with nicknames he knows what nicknames will stick he knows why they stick low-energy Jeb little Marco lyin Ted crooked Hillary he's really good at this he does it all the time and horseface is one of these and and the reason that we're talking about it the reason we're spending so much time talking about it even on this show is because of the name but what does the name represent that the stormy Daniels thing was a force that it was nothing it went nowhere and it reminds us it keeps at the front of our minds that she lost this battle Michael avenatti the third-rate lawyer lost this battle who won the battle President Trump and a reminder that he's he's very good at language no I want to get into the Democrat meltdown there has been nothing short of a total Democrat meltdown here you've you've looked at the case you know that the Senate races across the country let me put this in perspective for you yesterday in the state of Nevada a GOP candidate for state legislature and a pimp he was a pimp and a brothel owner was discovered dead in his bed by legendary porn star ron jeremy after a campaign brothel party at which sheriff joe arpaio and tax reform hero grover norquist were in attendance and that tucker carlson called in to pimp GOP candidate brothel owner brothel party 70s porn star joe arpaio grover norquist that is like not even a headline today that is so not the news of the day that might be the fifth wildest political story of the day that tells you something about the democratic party going into full meltdown mode what is going on obviously the biggest one is elizabeth warren this is to rip Heidi Heitkamp it's true they don't work at beta or robert Francis O'Rourke it's true of all of these races but the Liz Warren one is just too delicious the Cherokee Nation has come out now and issued a statement saying stop pretending to be Native American you're not Native American this is a fraud you should apologize total PR disaster I don't I like to give politicians their due when it comes to little PR stunts even if they're Democrats this was an unmitigated disaster a complete backfire on Liz Warren she could have walked outside and just repeatedly stepped on a rake it would have been less of a self-inflicted wound than what she did with this stupid DNA test even MSNBC the left-wing news outlet is making fun of her for this you're there this DNA the DNA test results best I can gather according to your papers reporting she's one one thousand I think I might be just as Native American as she is on MSNBC statistically speaking he that guy is he's probably more Native American than she is the average American is 1.8 percent Native American the average white person and she is 1/1000 24th and she thought this was going to work so now she's in in total damage control mode she's tweeting she's trying to go into damage control mode here is I think this is the most compelling damage control commercial that the warren campaign has put out so far take a look I'm not even gonna explain that for the people who were just listening to this show right now you have to go online and watch that clip I think you know people can stop it's the one one little tear going down I don't know if that one's gonna work either though absolutely awful you know she really you might say she really tried to Buffalo the American people on this one hmm you might say the response was really a savage mmm all right enough of that so the Cherokee Nation comes out against her they say please stop pretending to be a Native American and then you know Donald Trump calls her Pocahontas this is now added this whole episode has added a number of new nicknames to the popular consciousness alaya wathah polka honky Chiefs spreading bull on and on and on now a Pocahontas descendant her name is Debbie white of Perico Perico is coming out and calling on Liz Warren to apologize as it makes a mockery of Native Americans I don't know I I take it that this Native American family married into the Italians at some point if with a name like Debbie wiped up Perico maybe not I don't know but she does she should apologize Liz Warren should apologize she can't apologize now so I think the idea was I'm gonna go and I'm gonna show that I'm gonna hit back she's actually ironically Liz Warren is trying to learn the lessons of the trump era she's trying to emulate Donald Trump as Donald Trump punches he fights back he does but it doesn't work when people who are not Donald Trump try to be Donald Trump do you remember you know little Marco doing the Rickles routine it does not work they don't get this lesson you can only be yourself you can only bring yourself to politics I mean look everything you've ever done is going to be exposed your character is gonna be exposed it's gonna be tested you're gonna be exhausted you can have all these fair and unfair attacks against you you can only be yourself the inauthentic things are gonna wash away especially in this era with 4k and social media and 24/7 news you can only be yourself she isn't this person she's not good at fighting back I think her 20/20 hopes are over I am I'm willing to make that prediction now actually which is so early to do it but I think it's over I mean even for Vice President I think she would have a very hard time it's more plausible for a VP spot I thought she was fatally wounded mortally wounded even before this debacle this DNA test again because of this authenticity thing and again because what we know about Liz Warren first of all she's grating she's annoying she's elitist she's arrogant she's all of these things she's not an attractive candidate outside of Massachusetts was that her tribe know she's Cherokee not message Massachusetts so she wasn't a great candidate nationally in that regard anyway but after this I mean you know in in the beginning all we knew is she's a fraud she passed herself off as something that she patently is not for decades and decades beginning in the eighties doubling down in the 90s so I thought that would hit her if she had just not addressed it and just left it up to people's imagination maybe she could have pulled the Clinton and said oh that's old news you know the Clintons would always do this they would they would commit some scandal and then they would Stonewall reporters when they would ask about it or Stonewall Republicans when they would ask about it and then years later they'd say it's old news it's not old news you just haven't answered it until now and now you're saying it's it's old she might have been able to do that but after this the gamble left her far worse off now we know she's one one-thousandth maybe maybe one one-thousandth Native American it really hits her this also teaches another lesson of 2018 which is denied denied denied till you die it's sort of a sad state of our politics that there's no grace and there's no mercy and there's no repentance right now but you see it with the me2 movement the the people who admitted to sexual misconduct in Hollywood in corporate America and in politics the ones who admitted and apologized are dead they are in jail they have had their careers ruined they're like they get Kevin Spacey they get cast into the outer darkness where there's weeping and gnashing of teeth the ones who deny do fine the ones who deny basically can survive it Ben Affleck denied he survives it these other media moguls who deny they survived it some politicians who denies or Bob Menendez can survive it that is the lesson that's kind of sad because it means we're in a particularly shallow moment where we don't have a sense of mercy we don't have a sense of grace we're just out for blood right for revenge right for justice but that is the fact and candidates who are running this year I have to watch out for that hopefully it'll change in the future because I'd rather live in a world where you can say oh yeah ten years ago I did that thing and I shouldn't have done it I feel bad I haven't done it since I don't want to do anymore say okay that's fine but we don't we don't live there right now so if you're running in 2018 deny until you died that's all you can do America's not feeling particularly remorseful at the moment the other total collapse beyond Liz Warren is Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota Heidi Heitkamp if you haven't seen this story she released a full-page newspaper ad listing the names purportedly of sexual assault victims so women who say I was sexually assaulted I was and she lists their names in a newspaper ad for her campaign and then it turns out the women never gave their permission to be in the ad and then it turns out some of the women were not sexually assaulted they actually deny ever having been sexually assaulted what was heidi heitkamp thinking i mean there whatever aid took out this newspaper ad what were they thinking this is the me to hysteria in full-swing you want to talk about a pendulum going back and forth this is absurd you're now outing people who were raped or sexually assaulted and don't want it to be known because of the stigma attached to it and then you're just making it up for other people where did they get this list one of the women Katie Miller said quote a lot of these people listed including me did not get give anyone permission for our names to be posted I don't even support heidi heitkamp and i am not a domestic abuse survivor obviously whatever staffer put this together has long been fired and probably murdered but could you imagine heidi heitkamp face she was already facing a really tough reelection fight she got killed in this Kavanagh thing because she doubled down on the character assassination and so she was already 1012 points behind her Republican opponent now I could you imagine her face the jaw just dropping and hitting the floor she immediately went into damage control mode and issued an apology but probably too little too late here she is the only thing I can do is say I am so sorry I'm not going to ask for forgiveness but I want to know what we can do to fix this and so it's not that this is I'm not minimizing in any way Scott this this event I think that this is horrible and I look at this the way I would if I were someone whose name was in the paper who didn't authorize it and I think that that is a colossal and huge mistake for which I will undoubtedly you know you know have have reputational injury as a result of it but I'm not worried about that I'm worried about fixing what we've done and the mistake that's been made she even botched the apology I mean she had the right instinct which is oh dear God I have to apologize right now Oh what has happened so she goes on she calls in to CNN she calls in to whatever this radio station and they played all over cable news I'm sorry I'm sorry deaden Edyta and she said it was a colossal mistake for which I will and what she doesn't say is for which I will lose the election shouldn't say for which my capital political career will be over she's clearly thinking and she's thinking how can I say that in a way that gives me an out if by some miracle I win this election now and so she says for which I will you know suffer personal reputational injury and then she realizes oh my gosh I'm what am i doing I'm making it about me again I'm making it all about me the mistake in the first place is that I made these women's rapes and sexual assaults all about me and used it cynically to my own political advantage and I'm doing it again and this is what Democrats have been doing for the entire me to movement this is what they've been doing for the entire Cavanagh circus is they've been pretending to care about sexual assault and rape and all they're doing is cynically exploiting him they're actually injuring the people who have been raped and sexually assaulted by exploiting crimes against them for political benefit to no benefit to the victims or the accusers or in some cases the hoaxers to no benefit so she says that and then and then she has to turn at the enter she says you know it'll give me personal reputational injury but I'm not concerned about that yeah obviously you are concerned about that that was your conclusion you said this is so bad I'm so so sorry and I as a result of this I'm going to have my reputation injured it's not I'm so so sorry these women's reputations have been injured I'm so so sorry these women have been dragged through the mud or now exposed to the national news media are now at the height of this sexual assault national debate international debate no no you're not sorry about that you're sorry that it's gonna hurt your reputation you're sorry that it's gonna hurt your chances at reelection and then she's oh no I didn't mean that I mean watches it every which way how on earth do you mess up this badly I think it is because Trump is getting in their heads because everything they expected everything to fall apart if that guy was elected president they expected the economy to collapse us to start a world war to be in some conflict and when everything turned out to be exactly the opposite that it does not compute they were shocked they didn't consider the possibility that things would work out if the Republicans were running the government and they've just cracked up they've totally broken down and by the way then the next line you're gonna hear out of Heidi Heitkamp yeah and out of her campaign is that Oh Heidi Heitkamp didn't know about this ad oh it was just some low-level staffer oh it was just some campaign whatever the buck stops there the buck stops with the candidate it's true candidates don't run their campaigns not on the day-to-day that's why you have a campaign manager the candidate has to go out and be the candidate the campaign manager has to be the manager the actor in the movie has to perform in the movie and the director needs to watch everything else but nevertheless the buck stops with the candidate if a candidate can't run a campaign then the candidate cannot be trusted with the keys to our federal government period end of story so really really brutal it would be a miracle for her if she if she wins out there in North Dakota I don't see I don't see a really happening how about in Arizona Kyrsten Sinema cinema cinema she has a lead over the Republican martha mcsalley still but all of the momentum is in Mick Sally's direction so what you know the Republican candidate was way down here the Democrat was way up here kind of floating along now taking a little bit of a nosedive and mcsalley is shooting shooting up so the momentum is there it is a dead heat though it's not as though mcsalley is in the lead right now not in a statistically significant lead so just at this moment we're already you've got mcsalley on the upswing we have released probably is a little October surprise from the Republicans a video of sanema saying how much she hates her own state you couldn't make this up you couldn't you say okay I I need some good Oppo to drop in in October I do you have anything she talks about taxes or I don't know saying well how about if she says she hates all of the voters what she says she despises her constituents and the people voting for her take a look for if you choose not to acknowledge the changing nature of your community and allow instead extremists to fill the space created by the natural movement of change then Arizona could also be your future Arizona could all heaven forfend goodness cry hope that Arizona is and isn't the future she's saying if you don't allow change if you don't force me to go in and change the way of life in Arizona and if you don't allow change in other communities you're gonna end up like those troglodyte knuckle-draggers in my home state of Arizona let I mean just a little bit of political advice to Kirsten voters really don't like change when you go in and you say your way of life is terrible and I want to change it I want to fundamentally transform it that creates a resistance against you and then if you go in and say also I hate your guts and I hate who you are and you people are awful not a great way to win votes it would be it would be like a presidential candidate having it uncovered that there was a video of him saying that he hates Bald Eagles and apple pie you know like a week before the election that is the equivalent of this I mean it's unfathomable that she would ever make these kind of comments except that the left has gone insane it's totally it's lost control of the narrative so there they used to always say look the leftist just as patriotic as the right the left we love our country to dissent as patriotic and we look but and then you say well but you burn the American flag you protest the national anthem you say your presidential candidate says you want to fundamentally transform the country which means you don't like the country you don't you dislike the country and you want it to be something different this is when the truth comes out they've cracked up they realize they they actually think that it's in the common culture that people hate America they hate the West they hate their community they hate their countrymen no it's on tumblr it's on blogs it's on Twitter it's in your own little ideological bubble where you unfriend anybody who disagrees with you and anybody that you disagree with and in that bubble that makes sense but you've lost an understanding of everybody else she goes on that it wasn't those weren't even really her most damned comments about Arizona here are some others Arizona is the state of the five seas so cattle copper citrus cotton and climate we have a sixth seed it's called crazy in my state Arizona it's clearly the meth lab I want to talk to you about some of the things that I think that you can do to stop your state from becoming Arizona Deanna's be more crazy Arizona is the meth lab of democracy is she like a late-night comedian is she what is she doing I obviously this was taken a little while ago they're not that long ago because she looks exactly the same they're not a good idea if you despise your your state to try to run for Senate there you've got you should run somewhere else you should run where people like you so I think it's gonna really hurt her the the momentum was already in the other direction and this is a pretty good october surprise for whichever republican dug this up for it pretty good stuff and I'm glad they sat on it we're gonna see a lot more October surprises and then we have to get to the best race of all beto beta male beta O'Rourke robert francis in texas so much more as stephen hawking is giving us a warning from beyond the grave of the upcoming apocalypse we've got louis farrakhan we've got robin williams a lot more to get to first i've got to say goodbye to facebook and youtube now today at seven o'clock Eastern 4 p.m. Pacific do not miss our next episode of daily wire backstage with ben shapiro god-king jeremy boring and replevin myself and alicia Kraus we will be taking questions but only from daily wire subscribers so make

answers question conversation this this is what matters this is the straight from the meth lab of democracy itself the leftist tears tumblr i don't know where to begin with this one and also I guess I'm gonna have to I'm gonna I guess I'm gonna have to talk a little little trash about our leftist ears tumblr here now it's obviously excellent quality it's an FDA approved vessel it's too small it's too small we're going to to get a bigger one hopefully by the time you subscribe we'll have bigger we'll have like a Titanic sized vessel to contain all of them because they're really really big there's a there's a way of coming there's a salty leftist tears way of coming make sure you get your tumbler before it drowns you so much more to get to go to daily wire.com we'll be right back last but also least beta O'Rourke mr. bata himself met for the final debate with Ted Cruz national debating champion it was bloody it was pretty bad his campaign not looking great right now I mean looking great from our perspective not looking great for mr. bata so I'll point out beta O'Rourke raised 40 million dollars in the third fundraising quarter this is a 40 million dollars this is a huge amount of money I think it's a it breaks the record right he took in a huge cash hole what on earth he needs 40 million dollars for with three weeks to go of the campaign not even three weeks left of the campaign nobody knows we might have some speculation so he's taking in all of this money he's not really spending a lot of it because his numbers are not great I think right now polls show Cruz has a seven-point lead so look it could bethe O'Rourke could win it is entirely possible if Republicans don't get out to vote that beta O'Rourke will win now Greg Abbott has a higher margin right now the governor of Texas has a higher margin of victory than Ted Cruz does according to the pollsters however nobody is gonna go be an Abbott voter but not vote for Cruz right nobody's gonna be an Abbott beta voter so I'm even a little skeptical of some of those polls nevertheless beta is raising a ton of money it's the largest amount ever raised by a Senate candidate in a single quarter but the last record was in the year 2000 when Rick Lazio ran for the Senate against Hillary Clinton and raised 22 million so let this sink in the last record that beta work just beat was raised by one of the biggest losers to run for the United States Senate he lost a Hillary Clinton carpetbagging Hillary Clinton moved to New York about a week before her election campaign and he lost tremendously and gay and foisted Hillary on us for another eight or ten year ever an August 16 years so not great news if O'Rourke said yeah I've raised all this look at all this money that I've raised you think well the guy you just beat was one of the biggest losers not a huge victory so that they met last night crews and O'Rourke for the final debate before the election oh where to begin where to begin take it away mr. bata first Jason let me thank you and Sarah from moderating tonight's debate Ken's five for hosting us the people of San Antonio for being here and the people of Texas for watching this and participating in one of the most important decisions of our lifetimes okay okay starts out basically good I mean biggest decision of our lifetimes the Senate race in Texas I don't really buy that I don't think that the race between beta or orc and Ted Cruz when the Republicans control Congress Republicans control the Senate Republicans control the house or though the White House is really one of the biggest decisions in your lifetime you should rethink your life if that is the case but okay he's just speaking typical political hyperbole go on mr. Beddoe estar aqui con ustedes otra vez a key in San Antonio Oh muy mal muy muy mal Senor beta Senor robert francis or auric robert francis bate oh oh yes my name's Senor baito yo hablo espanol don't you know how you die Tito okay not helping your case Beto O'Rourke is in a fully Irish guy he's probably a little more Native American than Elizabeth Warren but he's still an Irish guy he goes by Beto because he wants to appeal to Spanish voters in Texas Hispanic voters but he's not at all Hispanic and it's absurd and it's cynical so what look racial identity politics has become very important thanks to the left and the Democratic Party they've made a big deal about this when you lie about your ethnicity that doesn't reflect very well on you Elizabeth Warren has learned this I think mr. o'roarke has learned this too what you need to do when you're called out for this is stop calling attention to it stop calling attention to the fact that you're a fraud and a cynical race hustler what does better work do he speaks Spanish during a debate in the state of Texas not not a very smart move so he he habla espanol with his Irish brogue and then he goes on what's the biggest hit what's that was here Eric sock-it-to-me mr. bata what's gonna be your your clock on Ted Cruz our junior senator will not stand up to president Trump someone who apologizes for Russia defends that country Vladimir Putin the leader of the country that sought to undermine our democracy he won't stand up against him and he won't stand up for us to make sure that our elections are free and fair that your vote goes to the intended candidate this this is beyond party politics this is getting this is getting our democracy back on track and we need a a senator from Texas who will do that what a stupid strategy what the Russia thing is totally empty one virtually every public opinion poll shows Americans do not care about Russian collusion mostly because there's no such thing as Russian collusion the FBI hasn't come up with anything it looks increasingly like a set up by Democrats we have evidence in part that it was a set up by Democrats and the Obama administration and the Clinton campaign not a great issue why would you make this your issue by the way there is talk now that robert muller is wrapping up his investigation i don't know they've been saying he's wrapping it up for months now so i don't know if i believe it but let me tell you something if Muller had something on Trump it would be leaking right now so give it a few more days but it would be leaking right now if they really had something that was gonna get the president the United States if it doesn't leak before these midterms they don't have nothing they don't have anything so that attack is a total waste he stands up to her he doesn't stand up to Russia okay and then he says that Cruz won't stand up to president Trump this attack also falls flat there are plenty of good ways to attack Ted Cruz this isn't one of them crews fought Trump tooth and nail for the Republican presidential nomination he fought him all the way to the convention and then at the GOP convention he wouldn't even endorse the guy he wouldn't even say go out and vote for Trump he said go vote your conscience now people might have an issue with Cruz doing that absolutely fair enough but that what that certainly shows is he's willing to stand up to Donald Trump he stood up to him for the entire campaign and he was the last man standing in fact that that is probably Cruz's biggest problem if the biggest problem facing Cruz right now is he isn't as being a team player and loyal to the administration which has been very successful for conservative policy in some quarters I think he's been terrific it actually but in some quarters he's seen is not not loyal to the administration okay so by bed overworked saying that saying to be won't you know go out and attack Donald Trump you're actually galvanizing Cruz's base why does Cruz have a lower have lower poll numbers than Greg Abbott the Republican governor of Texas it's me as Cruz has been embroiled in some of these controversies with the current president because he's been embroiled in some controversies his senator bado is doing bethe Robert Francis is doing Cruz's work for him here the only thing that makes sense about this is that he's not running for Senate right now O'Rourke O'Rourke is looking at the numbers he's saying I'm probably not gonna be able to make up that difference in the next two and a half weeks so what I'm going to do is save the 40 million that I've gotten out of Democrats and try to run for president in 2020 that's word on the street from people who are working on some of these races all I can say is if you're a Democrat watching this show thanks hey well that's cool I didn't know I didn't know you were there also if you're democrat watching this show give your money donate now to bado O'Rourke he donate right and give all the money you possibly can because O'Rourke is sucking money out of all of these other swing Senate races and he's just throwing it in his campaign coffers to try to run in 2020 so it sounds good I'm sure that Republicans in North Dakota Indiana Missouri I am sure they Thank You congressman or work for for taking money out of races where that it actually might matter not looking rate not looking great for them not looking great for him at all we'll see look at things can change all the time I'm not predicting anything because they're always October surprises that come up even later than this and that might happen again plus the Federal Reserve might raise interest rates and put a damper on the economy I think it's still a little too late for that to really matter but President Trump is talking about this right now so the the big headline that no one's talking about is that the US has reclaimed the number one most country in the world title this is according to the World Economic Forum this is the first time since 2008 that we've had that hmm what happened between 2008 and this administration mmm I've got a few silver oxide I'm Hussein us a bit mom no no no a Barack Hussein Obama that I think I was his name that's what happened I've almost forgotten about him because his legacy has been erased right now we're beating Singapore beating Germany being Switzerland beating Japan so great economic news right now if the Federal Reserve raises interest rates that could put a damper on the exploding economy and president Trump acknowledged this he said the biggest threat that he faces politically is the Federal Reserve because the Federal Reserve is independent monetary policy unlike fiscal policy is independent of political machinations from the elected officials so if they raise the rates too quickly and they put a damper on economic growth it could obviously hit him hopefully that won't happen but you know this is a big win for all Republicans this is on top of the Trump win on the court ruling with stormy Daniels and her third-rate lawyer Michael avenatti this is on top of getting Kavanagh confirmed and Republicans are running hard on the confirmation of Kavanagh right now and all of the other judges this is all pretty good news so the bad news comes from Stephen Hawking Steve I know he died in March how does he have bad news to give us he has a message from beyond the grave stephen hawking published a new book where he explains all of the awful things that are going to occur to all of us in near future particularly around AI artificial intelligence and gene editing technology so rather than read the book rather than tell you to read the book i was a actually able through the power of voodoo to get professor Hawking on the phone from beyond the grave and to get a just a quick little interview professor what would you like for us to know was that are you still there professor did you I guess he cut out I don't know if that's talking I know he was a famous atheist so I don't know if he's talking about the horror where he is or the horror where where we're going to who knows you never know where people go after after this life is over once we've shuffled off this mortal coil so he's predicting that things are gonna look pretty bad for us pretty quickly he's writing in his new book what while primitive forms of artificial intelligence developed so far have proved very useful I fear the consequences of creating something that can match or surpass humans humans who are limited by slow biological evolution could not compete and would be superseded we've heard this before we've heard these kind of scare stories about artificial intelligence you know are you Sarah Connor ah you know Terminator comes back and and they slaughter all of humanity I'm not that concerned about that right now mostly because I'm skeptical of artificial intelligence ever being creative right now we think of artificial intelligence as you know being so advanced it's about to surpass humans but artificial intelligence doesn't think the way that humans think humans are creative I think David gallant or the computer scientist yell made this point decades ago the way that artificial intelligence works is it solves problems and certainly the human brain solves problems but it does a lot more than just solve problems we think creatively when I'm you know I'm sitting there with my Kofi Faye on the table and I'm you know I don't know Ben and Jeremy are trying to get me to do work or something and I'm just kind of looking at them and I'm staring off in the distance I guys like a you know I'm you would call that daydreaming I guess is that think I'm certainly not solving problems but I am thinking there is some kind of thinking going on what about when I sleep when I'm dreaming at night I'm not solving problems usually in my sleep but I am thinking there is an intelligence going on at that at that moment artificial intelligence doesn't really capture that and it doesn't capture inventiveness and creativity I suspect that it won't be able to do that and I suspect it will never be conscious because our consciousness is a metaphysical question rather than merely a physical question the relationship of our mind to our brain and our physical body and a lot of the people pushing the AI scariness and spookiness are materialists who think that there's nothing in the world other which is physical and material obviously we know that that isn't true because there's love and beauty and mathematics and transcendence and glory and virtue and all of those sort of things okay so I'm not terribly worried about that aspect of it Stephen Hawking then goes on he says quote once such superhumans appear and we're not just talking about AI anymore he's talking about superhumans he's talking specifically about the ability to edit our genome so right now we have emerging technology like CRISPR gene editing CRI SPR to be able to go in to the genetic you Minh genetic code and delete malformed pieces of the genetic code things that cause disease things that cause deformations in our genes okay that's good and and that's emerging technology to be able to try to correct diseases once we really harness that technology what would stop human beings from using that technology to improve the human genome make us stronger better faster stronger to quote our future Republican president Kanye West I can't imagine what once we have that technology certainly will do certainly will do that will create a race of superhumans here's the fear from Hawking he says once the superhumans appear they were going to be significant political problems with the unimproved humans who will not be able to compete presumably they'll die out or become unimportant instead there will be a race of self designing beings who are improving themselves at an ever-increasing rate and that's certainly true because once you really improve yourself you get super smart super better faster stronger then you're exponentially going to increase the rate at which you can improve yourself that this is a true fear because it raises a lot of bioethical questions about what happens when you play God generally speaking it's a bad idea to play God doesn't turn out well for people who do it in the bible doesn't turn out well for people who try to do it in history and it can breed a lot of human misery that's happened politically with utopian political movements it's happened with technological political movements eugenic political movements like the Nazis and in the Unites States for that matter it's not good and the worst part of it is that our moral dialogue has been so impoverished that we don't even have the vocabulary to talk about these bioethical concerns during the Bush administration they had a panel on bioethical inquiry to talk about abortion cloning in vitro fertilization that kind of stuff today it's only 15 years later I don't know that we even have that ability to discuss bio ethical questions like that why even if we can create a race of superhumans maybe we shouldn't end it obviously we shouldn't do that that that's unfortunate and speaking of our poultry ethical dialogue Google has gone out and just basically admitted that they're going to be evil you know they had that old quote don't be evil and now the new motto I think is just be evil I think they deleted one word it's that's it's more efficient it's streamlined because now they're saying sundar pichai the head of Google is saying that they're working with the Chinese government they're exploring work with them to censor their citizens to censor political dissidents to work with one of the most evil regimes on earth we we know that this is happening after Google pulls out of a competition for cloud computing with the Pentagon with the United States Defense Department and after they're pulling out of an AI project with the US Defense Department because employees at Google complained that Google was working with the US military the employees don't want Google to work with the US military they do want Google to work with the sensorial meanest a brutal tyrannical totalitarian Chinese government that is a moral idiocy and a moral blindness that is pretty shocking it also exposes a point that the Trump campaign understood in 2015 2016 and that I think some conservatives are coming to now which is a questioning of our idolatry of the free market obviously we love free market economics it creates so much prosperity for ourselves and for the whole world but we can't make an idol out of it because there are some questions raised by this this is what we call neoliberalism neoliberalism being the advocacy of free markets free trade free everything without regard to national boundaries or national loyalties that this can breed a lot of good absolutely but if you've got an American company Google and essentially American company saying that they won't work with their own government to protect their own government's national interests and they will work with that governments enemies with their own nation's enemies to censor their citizens and maybe give them technology that could be used to fight against the United States then you know that neoliberalism has gone wrong Irving Kristol who is a neoconservative that word neoconservative has been abused to the point of not having any meaning anymore almost but Irving Kristol was a left-winger who became a conservative in the 60s and 70s and Irving Kristol described a neoconservative as a liberal who had been mugged by reality but then he went on people know that quote he went on to describe a neoliberal as a liberal who had been mugged by reality but didn't press any charges and I think that's what we're seeing here a real questioning look I love being able to get cheap consumer goods I want to be able to sell cheap consumer goods I want access to a lot of markets but when you have one of the biggest countries in the history of the world and an American company going in and saying we will not help out the United States government and we will help out the government the United States as enemies and we will help those enemies censor their own population and ins helped to enslave their own population which is what China has become China's becoming a slave state with concentration camps cameras everywhere monitoring citizens facial recognition I mean a true dystopian hell then you know that something has gone terribly wrong in your economic ideology and maybe it requires changing a lot more to get to but unfortunately we don't have time today we're out of time tune in for backstage maybe we'll talk a little bit more about those things get your mailbag questions and that's gonna be tomorrow and so we'll be we'll be seeing you then in the meantime I'm
