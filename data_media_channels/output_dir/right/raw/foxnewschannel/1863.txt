1
00:00:00,284 --> 00:00:02,786
SO FAR, NO RESPONSE FROM SENATOR

2
00:00:02,786 --> 00:00:04,688
MCCAIN OR DIRECTLY FROM THE

3
00:00:04,688 --> 00:00:09,393
WHITE HOUSE ON THAT.

4
00:00:09,393 --> 00:00:10,627
>> Julie: THE PENTAGON RELEASING

5
00:00:10,627 --> 00:00:11,562
A REPORT ON THE INVESTIGATION

6
00:00:11,562 --> 00:00:12,896
INTO THE DEATHS OF FOUR AMERICAN

7
00:00:12,896 --> 00:00:15,699
SOLDIERS IN AN AMBUSH IN NIGER.

8
00:00:15,699 --> 00:00:17,434
MEN KILLED IN A SURPRISE ATTACK

9
00:00:17,434 --> 00:00:18,302
OVERRUN BY ABOUT 100 ISIS

10
00:00:18,302 --> 00:00:21,238
FIGHTERS.

11
00:00:21,238 --> 00:00:24,441
>> ALL OF OUR SOLDIERS FOUGHT

12
00:00:24,441 --> 00:00:25,743
VALIANTLY THAT DAY.

13
00:00:25,743 --> 00:00:27,778
AND THERE WERE A SERIES OF

14
00:00:27,778 --> 00:00:30,681
CONTRIBUTING FACTORS TO WHAT

15
00:00:30,681 --> 00:00:33,150
OCCURRED BUT NONE OF THOSE

16
00:00:33,150 --> 00:00:34,518
CONTRIBUTING FACTORS ARE THE

17
00:00:34,518 --> 00:00:36,053
DIRECT CAUSE OF THE ENEMY

18
00:00:36,053 --> 00:00:36,387
ATTACK.

19
00:00:36,387 --> 00:00:37,488
THE DIRECT CAUSE OF THE ENEMY

20
00:00:37,488 --> 00:00:39,022
ATTACK IS THAT THE ENEMY

21
00:00:39,022 --> 00:00:40,391
ACHIEVED TACTICAL SURPRISE

22
00:00:40,391 --> 00:00:40,758
THERE.

23
00:00:40,758 --> 00:00:42,359
AND OUR FORCES WERE OUTNUMBERED

24
00:00:42,359 --> 00:00:44,762
APPROXIMATELY 3-1.

25
00:00:44,762 --> 00:00:47,097
>> Julie: LUCAS IS STANDING BY

26
00:00:47,097 --> 00:00:48,298
LIVE AT THE PENTAGON FOR US.

27
00:00:48,298 --> 00:00:49,633
DID THE INVESTIGATION FIND FAULT

28
00:00:49,633 --> 00:00:51,602
WITH ANY U.S. MILITARY LEADERS?

29
00:00:51,602 --> 00:00:54,204
>> NO, IT DIDN'T, JULIE.

30
00:00:54,204 --> 00:00:55,072
THE INVESTIGATION BLAMED A LACK

31
00:00:55,072 --> 00:00:56,507
OF TRAINING AND THE SPECIAL

32
00:00:56,507 --> 00:00:58,342
FORCES TEAM'S DECISION TO GO

33
00:00:58,342 --> 00:01:00,077
AFTER AN ISIS LEADER WITHOUT

34
00:01:00,077 --> 00:01:00,677
PROPER AUTHORITY.

35
00:01:00,677 --> 00:01:03,447
THE HEAD OF U.S. FORCES IN

36
00:01:03,447 --> 00:01:04,381
AFRICA SAYS CHANGES HAVE BEEN

37
00:01:04,381 --> 00:01:07,484
MADE SINCE THE OCTOBER AMBUSH.

38
00:01:07,484 --> 00:01:09,386
>> WE ARE NOW FAR MORE PRUDENT

39
00:01:09,386 --> 00:01:10,954
IN OUR MISSIONS, THE MISSIONS

40
00:01:10,954 --> 00:01:12,823
THAT WE ACTUALLY ACCOMPANY ON,

41
00:01:12,823 --> 00:01:14,358
HAVE SOME TYPE OF STRATEGIC

42
00:01:14,358 --> 00:01:15,759
VALUE IN TERMS OF THE ENEMY

43
00:01:15,759 --> 00:01:16,827
WE'RE GOING AGAINST, DO THEY

44
00:01:16,827 --> 00:01:18,061
HAVE A STRATEGIC THREAT TO THE

45
00:01:18,061 --> 00:01:18,562
UNITED STATES?

46
00:01:18,562 --> 00:01:21,098
AND WHAT THIS HAS DONE IS IT HAS

47
00:01:21,098 --> 00:01:22,566
ALLOWED THESE TEAMS, PERHAPS, TO

48
00:01:22,566 --> 00:01:23,467
NOT DO THE TEMPO THAT THEY WOULD

49
00:01:23,467 --> 00:01:25,769
LIKE.

50
00:01:25,769 --> 00:01:28,872
>> THE PENTAGON RELEASED THIS

51
00:01:28,872 --> 00:01:30,674
VIDEO RECONSTRUCTING THE ATTACK.

52
00:01:30,674 --> 00:01:31,909
THE REPORT BLAMED THE SPECIAL

53
00:01:31,909 --> 00:01:33,277
FORCES TEAM LEADER FOR

54
00:01:33,277 --> 00:01:34,778
MISCHARACTERIZING THE MISSION UP

55
00:01:34,778 --> 00:01:36,880
THE CHAIN OF COMMAND.

56
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:38,482
THE TEAM LEADER CLAIMED HE WAS

57
00:01:38,482 --> 00:01:41,318
CONDUCTING A ROUTINE MEETING

58
00:01:41,318 --> 00:01:43,921
WHEN IN FACT HE SENT OUT TO

59
00:01:43,921 --> 00:01:44,888
PURSUE A KNOWN LEADER.

60
00:01:44,888 --> 00:01:46,957
AND NOW SINCE THE ATTACK, ARMED

61
00:01:46,957 --> 00:01:48,926
DRONES ARE NOW FLYING OVER

62
00:01:48,926 --> 00:01:49,359
NIGER.

63
00:01:49,359 --> 00:01:49,660
JULIE?

64
00:01:49,660 --> 00:01:51,395
>> Julie: SO BASED ON WHAT THE

65
00:01:51,395 --> 00:01:53,797
GENERAL SAID, LUCAS, IT SOUNDS

66
00:01:53,797 --> 00:01:56,700
LIKE THE U.S. MILITARY HAS

67
00:01:56,700 --> 00:01:57,468
SCALED BACK OPERATIONS IN WEST

68
00:01:57,468 --> 00:01:59,903
AFRICA.

69
00:02:00,037 --> 00:02:01,538
IN THE WAKE OF THE OCTOBER 4TH

70
00:02:01,538 --> 00:02:03,240
ATTACK, THE HEAD OF U.S. SPECIAL

71
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:05,275
OPERATIONS FORCES IN AFRICA HAS

72
00:02:05,275 --> 00:02:06,376
ORDERED HIS TROOPS TO PLAN

73
00:02:06,376 --> 00:02:08,211
MISSIONS THAT KEEP THEM FROM

74
00:02:08,211 --> 00:02:09,079
DIRECT COMBAT.

75
00:02:09,079 --> 00:02:10,614
OF THE ROUGHLY 800 U.S. TROOPS

76
00:02:10,614 --> 00:02:13,317
IN NIGER, THEY WILL MOSTLY NOW

77
00:02:13,317 --> 00:02:14,685
REMAIN ON FORTIFIED COMMAND

78
00:02:14,685 --> 00:02:16,320
CENTERS AND ADVISE LOCAL FORCES

79
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:16,620
ONLY.

80
00:02:16,620 --> 00:02:19,890
THEY MUST GET APPROVAL FOR

81
00:02:19,890 --> 00:02:20,557
MISSIONS FROM THEIR HEAD

82
00:02:20,557 --> 00:02:21,258
QUARTERS IN GERMANY.

83
00:02:21,258 --> 00:02:22,593
IN ADDITION TO THE FOUR AMERICAN

84
00:02:22,593 --> 00:02:23,727
SOLDIERS KILLED, TWO OTHERS WERE

85
00:02:23,727 --> 00:02:24,695
WOUNDED INCLUDING THE TEAM

86
00:02:24,695 --> 00:02:25,028
LEADER.

87
00:02:25,028 --> 00:02:26,630
IT TOOK 36 HOURS TO FIND THE

88
00:02:26,630 --> 00:02:28,232
BODY OF SERGEANT LADAVID

89
00:02:28,232 --> 00:02:29,933
JOHNSON, THE GENERAL WHO LED THE

90
00:02:29,933 --> 00:02:30,667
INVESTIGATION SAID HE WAS NOT

91
00:02:30,667 --> 00:02:34,505
LEFT BEHIND.

92
00:02:34,505 --> 00:02:37,074
>> THE SEARCH FOR LADAVID

93
00:02:37,074 --> 00:02:37,841
JOHNSON NEVER STOPPED.

94
00:02:37,841 --> 00:02:39,176
HE RAN 960 METERS.

95
00:02:39,176 --> 00:02:40,944
HE RAN A LONG WAY FROM WHERE HE

96
00:02:40,944 --> 00:02:42,679
WAS LAST SEEN AND HE MADE HIS

97
00:02:42,679 --> 00:02:44,181
LAST STAND WHERE HE FOUGHT TO

98
00:02:44,181 --> 00:02:46,316
THE END UNDER A DENSE THORNY

99
00:02:46,316 --> 00:02:46,650
TREE.

100
00:02:46,650 --> 00:00:00,000
