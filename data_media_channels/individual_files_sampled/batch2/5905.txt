as Bob Woodward said to Rachel Maddow at the end of the last hour there's so many paths he said I've done this for 47 years I've never seen so many paths and I've never seen so much as he in any repeat he said there is a war on the truth one of the paths that Bob Woodward is talking about is a path to Donald Trump through his former campaign chairman Paul Manafort the special prosecutor is exploring that path and tonight the Washington Post is reporting that former Trump campaign Chairman Paul Manafort is in talks with special prosecutor Robert mother's office about a possible plea deal the Washington Post notes that the judge in the case today delayed a scheduled pre-trial hearing but there was no reason given for that delay the Washington Post notes that President Trump has praised Paul Manafort for not pleading guilty the post quotes the president saying prosecutors applied tremendous pressure on him and he refused to break make up stories in order to get a deal the president tweeted that last month such respect for a brave man that is the president's expressed respect for a convicted felon Bob Woodward's book reveals the president Trump's criminal defense lawyer John Dowd decided to quit the Trump defense team not because he believed President Trump was guilty of conspiring with Russians during the presidential campaign or because he believed President Trump was guilty of obstruction of justice but because Donald Trump simply could not tell the truth the book reports conversations between the president and his lawyer that could only have come from the president or his lawyer which means John Dowd appears to be the source of this material in the book especially since the book includes things that John Dowd thought but never said John Dodds own interior dialogue with himself is in this book and there's only one place to get that and that is that actually is what the last line of the book is the book ends with in in the man and his presidency Dowd had seen the tragic flaw in the political back-and-forth the evasions that the tweeting the obscuring crying fake news the indignation Trump had one overriding problem that Dowd knew but could not bring himself to say to the president your effing liar joining our discussion now Mimi Roker former federal prosecutor and Jason Johnson politics editor through calm they are both MSNBC contributors and Mimi what do you make of this report of plea negotiations with Paul Manafort tonight one of the paths as Bob Woodward recall it well it that would be significant no matter what kind of plea it turns out to be but it is worth noting that there are two different kinds of pleas that mana four could take one would be a plea where in exchange for the plea he gets some kind of benefit to his sentence you automatically get credit just for accepting responsibility and that can help you in your sentence the other would be a plea where you give information to the government and then you get an even bigger break in your sentence and right now as far as I know we don't know which one and that could make a huge difference in the sort of path of the investigation and where it goes from here obviously if manna Ford did decide to cooperate that would break open all sorts of new information I would assumed for Muller but even if he doesn't it would be very significant just if he took a plea I mean this is a man who's been fighting these charges tooth and nail it would I think be really something to see him stand up and under oath admit to guilt and I'm sure that part of what is going on and there was some reporting of this is Muller is even if he doesn't cooperate Muller is gonna want Manta for to admit to certain things that you know have been heavily disputed by the president I think and Jason Johnson if Paul Manafort does that if Paul Manafort decides that the truth is that he is guilty and he gets up and admits that he's guilty he will no longer be considered a brave man by this president of the United States no he will be considered a very dangerous man by this president AIT's because what does Paul Manafort have to offer brilliant insight some suggestions for suits maybe some information about Ukrainians no he primarily has information to offer about this presidency about this campaign about communications about finances that's the only thing that Paul Manafort can really come to the table and offer this investigation so it becomes a very dangerous man for this administration I think it's important to note that the fact that he's considering these negotiations means he either doesn't believe that a presidential pardon is coming or doesn't believe that a presidential pardon can cover him from all the crimes he is potentially guilty of and that's the other layer to this that sends a message to everybody else out there maybe pardons won't be enough and working with Muller might be your safer option me there are so many stunning things in Bob Woodward's book but one of them is John Dodds obvious cooperation with Bob Woodward on this book which seems to be a violation of the attorney-client privilege well it's a violation if he's revealing yes conversations that he had directly with trunk which it seems like yes he is although some of it as you say is also his internal dialogue that thinks he wished he had said to trumpet I think that seems to be but he's in there in with phone calls to his client telling Bob Woodward the words in quotation marks that were set on phone calls there's no question he should not be doing that it's a it's a violation of the attorney-client privilege and a number of ethical rules I don't know if he just doesn't care or it seems like what dad wants to do is sort of get his story out there about why it is you know that he left the team it wasn't because you know as you said he thinks he's guilty of collusion but because he thinks Trump can't tell the truth and and I think the important thing about that statement which is which plays such a big part in Dad's book sorry Woodward's book is that you no doubt knows that Trump could go in there and lie about the weather he could lie about things that don't matter and that's not gonna get Trump prosecuted for perjury because it's not a material exactly it needs to be a material and so doubt by saying that by saying you're gonna end up in an orange jumpsuit or some version of that he's really saying that he thinks Trump's gonna lie about things that would have a real impact on the investigation and what that tells me is that he thinks Trump knows things that would have an effect on the investigation so this whole you know claim of trumps you know knows nothing about collusion and no conversations with Russians that that just bring true with what doubt is saying here about the back story we're gonna have to squeeze in a break here Mimi Roker and Jason Johnson Jason's gonna come back thank you both for joining us thanks for checking
