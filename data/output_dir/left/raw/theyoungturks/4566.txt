1
00:00:00,179 --> 00:00:04,509
IN EL SALVADOR, TEEN RAPE VICTIM
HAS RECEIVED 30 YEARS IN

2
00:00:04,509 --> 00:00:08,140
PRISON AFTER A STILLBIRTH THAT
RESULTED FROM HER RAPE.

3
00:00:08,140 --> 00:00:10,610
HER NAME IS EVELYN BEECHER'S
HERNANDEZ CRUISE.

4
00:00:10,610 --> 00:00:14,020
SHE GAVE BIRTH INTO A
TOILET IN APRIL 2016

5
00:00:14,020 --> 00:00:17,060
AFTER FALLING ILL WITH ACUTE
BACK AND STOMACH PAIN.

6
00:00:17,060 --> 00:00:19,480
PREVIOUS TO THAT, SHE HAD BEEN
REPEATEDLY RAPED BY A GANG

7
00:00:19,480 --> 00:00:22,310
MEMBER OVER SEVERAL MONTHS AS
PART OF A FORCED SEXUAL

8
00:00:22,310 --> 00:00:23,539
RELATIONSHIP.

9
00:00:23,539 --> 00:00:26,371
EVEN BEFORE YOU FIND THAT WINDS
UP HAPPENING, THAT IS AN

10
00:00:26,371 --> 00:00:29,789
INCREDIBLY DARK AND SERIOUS
SITUATION THAT SHE'D BEEN

11
00:00:29,789 --> 00:00:30,960
INVOLVED IN.

12
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:33,482
NOW AFTER GIVING BIRTH, SHE WAS
ARRESTED WHEN PEOPLE WHEN

13
00:00:33,482 --> 00:00:36,000
POLICE FOUND THE DECEASED PEDIS
IN THE TOILET.

14
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,340
SHE'S BEEN A WEEK HANDCUFFED TO
A HOSPITAL BED BALL BEING

15
00:00:38,340 --> 00:00:41,190
TREATED FOR SEVERE ANEMIA AND A
URINARY TRACT INFECTION AND

16
00:00:41,190 --> 00:00:42,790
HAS BEEN DETAINED EVER SINCE.

17
00:00:42,790 --> 00:00:45,920
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT OVER YOUR
DETAINMENT BUT IMAGINE

18
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:49,350
AGAIN, BEFORE WE EVEN GET TO
THAT LEGAL REPERCUSSIONS,

19
00:00:49,350 --> 00:00:53,090
SHE HAS A LONG PERIOD OF
REPEATED RAPES, SHE HAS A

20
00:00:53,090 --> 00:00:55,920
TERRIBLE SITUATION, THE HEALTH
PROBLEMS THAT RESULT FROM IT,

21
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:59,719
AND THEY HANDCUFFED HER TO THE
BED LIKE SHOULD BROKEN THE LAW.

22
00:00:59,719 --> 00:01:03,000
OF COURSE, IN EL SALVADOR,
ABORTION IN ALL CASES AND

23
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,110
ILLEGAL SO SHE HAD ALTHOUGH
SHE HAD ONLY BROKEN EL

24
00:01:05,110 --> 00:01:09,920
SALVADOR'S LAWS NOT ANY MORAL OR
ETHICAL LAW.

25
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:11,040
SHE IS OF GOING TO COURT.

26
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:13,750
THE FEMALE JUDGE ACCEPTED THE
PROSECUTOR'S CLAIMS THAT

27
00:01:13,750 --> 00:01:17,190
HERNANDEZ FELT TO SEEK ANTENATAL
HERE BECAUSE YOU KNOW WHAT

28
00:01:17,190 --> 00:01:20,730
THE BABY AND THREW HIM INTO THE
TOILET INTENDING TO KILL HIM.

29
00:01:20,730 --> 00:01:23,210
AND SENSING SENTENCING THE JUDGE
WENT FURTHER AND SUGGESTED

30
00:01:23,210 --> 00:01:25,920
THAT HERNANDEZ CANNOT OF ENACTED
ALONE AND THAT HER MOTHER

31
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:29,000
MAY ALSO BECOMINGLY RESPONSIBLE
BECAUSE TAKING THIS GIRL

32
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,140
WHO HAD BEEN RAPED MULTIPLE
TIMES AND THROWING HER IN

33
00:01:31,140 --> 00:01:35,310
JAIL FOR 30 YEARS ISN'T ENOUGH
JUSTICE FOR THEM AT THIS POINT.

34
00:01:35,310 --> 00:01:36,770
THEY WANT TO GO FARTHER
POSSIBLY.

35
00:01:36,770 --> 00:01:41,229
FRANCISCO, I KNOW YOU ACTUALLY
WENT DOWN THERE AND TALK TO HER.

36
00:01:41,229 --> 00:01:44,860
JUST WANT TO MAKE ONE THING
CLEAR BEFORE WE GO TO THAT.

37
00:01:44,860 --> 00:01:51,610
IF YOU THINK, YOU BELIEVE THE
FACT PATTERN THAT SHE DELIVERED

38
00:01:51,610 --> 00:01:55,480
THE BABY AND THEN THREW IN THE
TOILET, THEN THAT WOULD BE

39
00:01:55,480 --> 00:01:57,610
MURDER.

40
00:01:57,610 --> 00:02:01,759
THE THING IS, IN THIS CASE, THE
MEDICAL EXPERTS WERE UNABLE TO

41
00:02:01,759 --> 00:02:05,490
ASCERTAIN WHETHER THE FETUS DIED
IN UTERO OR IN THE MOMENTS

42
00:02:05,490 --> 00:02:10,119
RIGHT AFTER DELIVERY, SO THAT
MEANS, OBVIOUSLY EL

43
00:02:10,119 --> 00:02:12,999
SALVADOR HAS DIFFERENT LEGAL
STANDARDS IN AMERICA IT'S

44
00:02:12,999 --> 00:02:14,279
BEYOND A REASONABLE DOUBT.

45
00:02:14,279 --> 00:02:17,540
THAT SHOULD SHE READ THERE THAT
THEY DID NOT HAVE EVIDENCE

46
00:02:17,540 --> 00:02:21,680
BEYOND A REASONABLE DOUBT THAT
SHE HAD DONE THAT.

47
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:26,159
SHE TESTIFIED AND EVERYONE ELSE
AROUND HER SAID NO, THAT IS

48
00:02:26,159 --> 00:02:27,379
NOT WHAT HAPPENED.

49
00:02:27,379 --> 00:02:28,560
SHE
HAD ABDOMINAL PAIN, DIDN'T

50
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:30,650
EVEN KNOW THAT'S WHAT WAS
HAPPENING IN HER MONTAGUE

51
00:02:30,650 --> 00:02:32,650
TO THE HOSPITAL AND THEN THEY
REALIZED ALL MY GOD, SHE TO

52
00:02:32,650 --> 00:02:35,420
STILLBIRTH AND THAT IS WHAT
HAD GONE INTO THE TOILET I

53
00:02:35,420 --> 00:02:38,389
DON'T KNOW DO BELIEVE THERE
EXCEPT FOR THE FACT THAT

54
00:02:38,389 --> 00:02:41,480
MEDICAL EXPERTS SAID THERE IS NO
WAY OF KNOWING SO THERE'S

55
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:44,669
NO WAY OF KNOWING, YOU'RE GOING
TO CHARGE HER WITH MURDER?

56
00:02:44,669 --> 00:02:47,790
THE ENTIRE CONTEXT, IN EL
SALVADOR, THIS IS ONLY

57
00:02:47,790 --> 00:02:50,450
CASEY COULD GO WELL, HE SAID,
SHE SAID.

58
00:02:50,450 --> 00:02:51,629
WE CAN'T QUITE TELL.

59
00:02:51,629 --> 00:02:56,410
NO, THEY'VE DONE THIS TO DOZENS
OF WOMEN, FOR STILLBIRTH,

60
00:02:56,410 --> 00:02:59,319
FOR ABORTIONS, LOCKING THEM UP
FOR A LONG TIME.

61
00:02:59,319 --> 00:03:01,939
ACTUALLY, HUNDRED AND 50
WOMEN HAVE BEEN PROSECUTED

62
00:03:01,939 --> 00:03:06,939
FOR ABORTIONS WHEN THEY HAVE HAD
MISCARRIAGES.

63
00:03:06,939 --> 00:03:12,980
I ACTUALLY MET EVELYN WHO IS
RIGHT NOW 19 AND WHEN I MET

64
00:03:12,980 --> 00:03:15,831
HER IN NOVEMBER OF LAST YEAR, I
WAS DOWN THERE FOR A STORY

65
00:03:15,831 --> 00:03:19,760
FOR NATIONAL GEOGRAPHIC CHANNEL,
ON THEIR SHOW EXPLORER, WE DID

66
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:23,459
A WHOLE SEGMENT ON IT, SHE HAD
ARTIE BEEN IN THIS OVERCROWDED

67
00:03:23,459 --> 00:03:28,709
PRISON IN EL SALVADOR FOR EIGHT
MONTHS AWAITING THIS SENTENCE.

68
00:03:28,709 --> 00:03:33,229
SHE TOLD ME, SHE'S CHOKING BACK
TEARS THAT SHE WAS RAPED AND

69
00:03:33,229 --> 00:03:37,559
THAT SHE DIDN'T KNOW THAT SHE
WAS PREGNANT AND SO INTEL SHE

70
00:03:37,559 --> 00:03:41,519
MISCARRIED, AND THIS HAPPENS ALL
THE TIME, AND YOU THINK IT'S

71
00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:45,219
RIDICULOUS, AND THEN YOU LIKE
HOW DID YOU KNOW.

72
00:03:45,219 --> 00:03:47,580
HOW DOES THE MEDICAL EXAMINER
NO?

73
00:03:47,580 --> 00:03:48,580
IT'S ILLEGAL.

74
00:03:48,580 --> 00:03:50,400
THAT
MIGHT BE DRACONIAN WHICH I

75
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:52,699
BELIEVE THAT IT IS, BUT HOW DO
YOU KNOW?

76
00:03:52,699 --> 00:03:56,150
ACTUALLY, IT IS VERY DIFFICULT
TO TELL WHETHER THERE HAS

77
00:03:56,150 --> 00:03:58,859
BEEN AN ABORTION OR A
MISCARRIAGE.

78
00:03:58,859 --> 00:04:03,400
YOU CAN'T TELL UNLESS THERE'S
LESIONS OR WHATEVER IT IS, BUT

79
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:07,590
IT IS ACTUALLY VERY DIFFICULT TO
TELL AND SHE IS NOT THE FIRST

80
00:04:07,590 --> 00:04:11,029
WOMAN TO HAVE BEEN SENTENCED OUT
THERE 17 WOMEN RIGHT NOW WHO ARE

81
00:04:11,029 --> 00:04:15,469
LANGUISHING IN PRISON WHO ARE
WAITING AND THEY ARE CONTESTING

82
00:04:15,469 --> 00:04:20,289
THEIR CASES AND THERE'S
BASICALLY ONE OR TWO LAWYERS TO

83
00:04:20,289 --> 00:04:25,580
REPRESENT THEM, ONE GUY NAMED
DENNIS MUNOZ BUT THE REASON EL

84
00:04:25,580 --> 00:04:29,909
SALVADOR MATTERS FOR AMERICANS
IS THAT IT IS A GLIMPSE INTO

85
00:04:29,909 --> 00:04:34,810
WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU START TO
ROLL BACK ABORTION LAWS.

86
00:04:34,810 --> 00:04:38,470
WHEN YOU START TO TAKE AWAY THE
RIGHT TO CHOOSE, THERE IS

87
00:04:38,470 --> 00:04:41,880
NO STOPPING IT AND IT SNOWBALLS.

88
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:48,570
FOR EXAMPLE, WHEN YOU START TO
SAY HEY, WE NEED TO HAVE, WE CAN

89
00:04:48,570 --> 00:04:54,419
RESTRICT THE ABORTIONS AT THE
SECOND TRIMESTER, THE FIRST

90
00:04:54,419 --> 00:04:58,120
TRIMESTER, THEN WE GO BACK, THEN
WE GO TO THE HEARTBEAT, AND THEN

91
00:04:58,120 --> 00:05:01,400
YEAH, THE LINE BETWEEN WHAT IS
AN ABORTION AND WHAT IS

92
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:05,270
CONSIDERED MURDER IS COMPLETELY
BLURRED AND WHAT IS THE

93
00:05:05,270 --> 00:05:08,090
RESULT OF THAT IS WOMEN ARE
SECOND-CLASS CITIZENS.

94
00:05:08,090 --> 00:05:10,650
THIS WOMAN WAS NOT LISTEN TO.

95
00:05:10,650 --> 00:05:15,020
SHE WAS NOT BELIEVED WHAT THE
LAWYER TOLD ME THERE IS THAT

96
00:05:15,020 --> 00:05:20,000
OFTENTIMES JUDGES ARE, HAVE NO
UNDERSTANDING THAT IT IS

97
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,879
DIFFICULT TO TELL THE DIFFERENCE
BETWEEN AN ABORTION AND A

98
00:05:22,879 --> 00:05:25,520
MISCARRIAGE WHICH IS WHY THERE
SENTENCING THESE WOMEN WHO

99
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:30,259
MISCARRIED TO PRISON TIME.

100
00:05:30,259 --> 00:05:32,370
THEY MAY NOT CARE.

101
00:05:32,370 --> 00:05:33,370
RIGHT.

102
00:05:33,370 --> 00:05:35,759
IS GIVE THAT MORE CONTEXT,
TOO.

103
00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:38,039
YOU MIGHT THINK, SHE DIDN'T KNOW
SHE WAS PREGNANT?

104
00:05:38,039 --> 00:05:39,039
COME ON.

105
00:05:39,039 --> 00:05:41,460
NO, WE'VE ACTUALLY COVERED A
LOT OF STORIES ON THE SHOW

106
00:05:41,460 --> 00:05:43,490
ABOUT WOMEN WHO DIDN'T KNOW THEY
WERE PREGNANT THAT IT DIDN'T

107
00:05:43,490 --> 00:05:47,289
LEAD TO THIS KIND OF SITUATION
NORMALLY, ALTHOUGH, ONE OF THE

108
00:05:47,289 --> 00:05:50,069
STORIES RECOVERED ON THE AIR WAS
A WOMAN HE WENT TO THE BATHROOM,

109
00:05:50,069 --> 00:05:52,210
DIDN'T KNOW SHE WAS PREGNANT AND
A BABY DROPPED OUT AND SHE WAS

110
00:05:52,210 --> 00:05:56,889
LIKE OH MY GOD AND SHE PICKED UP
THE BABY AND THE BABY IS FINE.

111
00:05:56,889 --> 00:05:59,281
TOTALLY DIFFERENT CASE, BUT IT
DOES HAPPEN FROM TIME TO

112
00:05:59,281 --> 00:06:02,060
TIME AND ON THE MISCARRIAGE AND
ABORTION, PEOPLE WHO ARE

113
00:06:02,060 --> 00:06:04,729
PRO-LIFE MY TURN AROUND AND GO
MAYBE SOME OF THOSE WERE

114
00:06:04,729 --> 00:06:06,540
NOT MISCARRIAGES, THEY WERE
ACTUALLY ABORTIONS BECAUSE

115
00:06:06,540 --> 00:06:09,909
YOU CAN'T TELL AND HENCE THEY
SHOULD BE PUNISHED WITH 30

116
00:06:09,909 --> 00:06:10,949
YEARS IN PRISON.

117
00:06:10,949 --> 00:06:11,949
OKAY.

118
00:06:11,949 --> 00:06:13,760
I DON'T KNOW THAT ALL OF YOU
THINK THAT EVEN IF YOU ARE

119
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:17,200
PRO-LIFE BUT OBVIOUSLY SOME
PEOPLE IN EL SALVADOR, THE

120
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:19,330
GOVERNMENT DOES.

121
00:06:19,330 --> 00:06:23,159
ALSO, IT MIGHT NOT OF BEEN AN
ABORTION.

122
00:06:23,159 --> 00:06:24,720
IT MIGHT'VE BEEN A MISCARRIAGE.

123
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:28,699
HOW MANY WOMEN ARE ROTTING IN
PRISON IN EL SALVADOR

124
00:06:28,699 --> 00:06:32,020
BECAUSE THEY HAD A MISCARRIAGE?

125
00:06:32,020 --> 00:06:33,020
JESUS.

126
00:06:33,020 --> 00:06:36,900
WHICH BRINGS US BACK TO JESUS.

127
00:06:36,900 --> 00:06:40,090
NOW THAT I'VE GIVEN YOU THE FULL
CONTEXT OF IT AND THE UPS AND

128
00:06:40,090 --> 00:06:44,490
DOWNS AND BOTH SIDES, LET ME
JUST SAY WE KNOW WHAT

129
00:06:44,490 --> 00:06:48,199
HAPPENED IN EL SALVADOR ON A BIG
PICTURE.

130
00:06:48,199 --> 00:06:53,199
CATHOLIC GROUPS CAME IN AND
FUNDED A DRIVE TO PASS THIS LAW.

131
00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:57,419
IT WAS BACKGROUND 97 OR SO THAT
THIS HAPPENED, IN THE LATE

132
00:06:57,419 --> 00:06:59,470
1990S SO ALMOST 20

133
00:06:59,470 --> 00:07:05,090
YEARS AGO AND THE POPULATION IS
ACTUALLY NOT IN FAVOR OF IT.

134
00:07:05,090 --> 00:07:09,949
THERE IS A PUSH RIGHT NOW TO AT
LEAST GET AN EXEMPTION FOR

135
00:07:09,949 --> 00:07:13,289
RAPE, IF THE MOTHER'S LIFE IS
IN DANGER AND ONE OTHER

136
00:07:13,289 --> 00:07:16,449
EXCEPTION BUT THE GOVERNMENT
WON'T DO ANYTHING ABOUT IT.

137
00:07:16,449 --> 00:07:19,280
THEY REFUSE TO HAVE A VOTE SO
FAR FOR FOUR MONTHS AS

138
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:22,300
PEOPLE HAVE BEEN PUSHING FOR
THIS SO RELIGIOUS GROUPS

139
00:07:22,300 --> 00:07:28,580
CAME IN AND SAID MISCARRIAGE,
YOU KNOW, STILLBIRTH, WHATEVER.

140
00:07:28,580 --> 00:07:30,659
NO EXCEPTIONS.

141
00:07:30,659 --> 00:07:35,060
PUT THEM IN PRISON FOR 30 YEARS
IF THEY GET AN ABORTION.

142
00:07:35,060 --> 00:07:37,699
IN MIND YOU, JUST UP WITH
SOME CONTEXT ON THIS ALSO,

143
00:07:37,699 --> 00:07:41,009
EL SALVADOR IS ONE OF THE MOST
DANGEROUS COUNTRIES IN THE

144
00:07:41,009 --> 00:07:43,840
WORLD AND ALSO IT HAS THE
HIGHEST RATE OF THEM ASIDE

145
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:46,499
WHICH IS MURDER OF WOMEN IN THE
WORLD.

146
00:07:46,499 --> 00:07:50,309
THERE'S A REASON THAT THERE IS
A MASS INFLUX OF PEOPLE

147
00:07:50,309 --> 00:07:53,389
SEEKING ASYLUM REALLY,
IMMIGRANTS COMING INTO

148
00:07:53,389 --> 00:07:56,290
MEXICO COMING INTO UNITED STATES
FROM EL SALVADOR.

149
00:07:56,290 --> 00:08:00,220
IT IS NOT A GOOD PLACE TO BE A
WOMAN, TO BE ANYONE.

150
00:08:00,220 --> 00:08:03,800
THERE'S A LOT OF GANG VIOLENCE,
AS WAS EXPERIENCED BY EVELYN

151
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:07,729
HERE, I THINK THE OTHER THING TO
MENTION IS THERE IS ANOTHER BILL

152
00:08:07,729 --> 00:08:11,159
FROM THE RIGHT WING PARTY RIGHT
NOW.

153
00:08:11,159 --> 00:08:13,740
I MET WITH A GUY WHO WAS DRAWING
IT UP.

154
00:08:13,740 --> 00:08:17,819
HE WANTS TO FURTHER CRIMINALIZE
ABORTION TO BE AN AUTOMATIC

155
00:08:17,819 --> 00:08:18,819
LIFE SENTENCE.

156
00:08:18,819 --> 00:08:20,099
30 YEARS IS NOT ENOUGH.

157
00:08:20,099 --> 00:08:22,069
KNOW, YOU COULD GET OUT.

158
00:08:22,069 --> 00:08:27,259
MEANWHILE, I MET A YOUNG WOMAN
WHO WAS SENTENCED TO 30 YEARS,

159
00:08:27,259 --> 00:08:31,000
ANOTHER WOMAN, WAS SENTENCE, HAD
A 33-YEAR-OLD SON WHEN SHE WAS

160
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:36,750
SENTENCED AND SHE WAS I BELIEVE
SOMETHING LIKE AROUND 20.

161
00:08:36,750 --> 00:08:38,789
SHE'S BEEN IN THERE FOR 10 YEARS
ALREADY.

162
00:08:38,789 --> 00:08:42,219
HER SON IS 13.

163
00:08:42,219 --> 00:08:43,219
THIS IS THE PRO-LIFE
POSITION.

164
00:08:43,219 --> 00:08:44,660
THIS IS WHAT HAPPENS.

165
00:08:44,660 --> 00:08:46,670
AGAIN, THE SLIPPERY SLOPE.

166
00:08:46,670 --> 00:08:51,320
I THINK WHEN WE THINK ABOUT WHAT
THAT MEANS FOR US IN THE UNITED

167
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:55,260
STATES, THIS IS WHY WE NEED TO
DEFEND ABORTION RIGHTS.

168
00:08:55,260 --> 00:09:00,230
WHETHER OR NOT YOU ARE PRO-LIFE
OR PRO-CHOICE, THIS IS HOW

169
00:09:00,230 --> 00:09:03,630
YOUR CONE UNIT CAN GET, WHEN A
MOTHER'S LIFE, ANOTHER

170
00:09:03,630 --> 00:09:07,770
SITUATION WHERE A MOTHER HAS
LEUKEMIA AND NEEDS TREATMENT.

171
00:09:07,770 --> 00:09:10,260
WELL, SHE IS PREGNANT AND SHE
CAN'T.

172
00:09:10,260 --> 00:09:13,120
THAT BABY WILL NOT BE ABLE TO BE
CARRIED TO TERM.

173
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:14,540
THERE'S NO WAY THIS BABY IS
SURVIVING.

174
00:09:14,540 --> 00:09:17,100
WHAT THEY HAVE TO DO IN EL
SALVADOR?

175
00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:19,420
THE MOTHER HAS TO CARRY THE BABY
TO TERM.

176
00:09:19,420 --> 00:09:24,269
SHE WILL DIE, THE FETUS WILL
DIE, BUT GOD WINS?

177
00:09:24,269 --> 00:09:26,060
I DON'T KNOW.

178
00:09:26,060 --> 00:09:27,260
THAT WAS ANOTHER CASE.

179
00:09:27,260 --> 00:09:29,269
JUDGE HAD A RULE AND THEN
FINALLY THIS WOMAN'S LIFE

180
00:09:29,269 --> 00:09:34,380
WAS SAVED BUT ONLY, AND THIS IS
CRAZY, IF SHE HAD A CESAREAN.

181
00:09:34,380 --> 00:09:37,329
SO THAT IT WAS LIKE A BIRTH, BUT
NOT.

182
00:09:37,329 --> 00:09:39,880
SHE COULDN'T HAVE A REGULAR
ABORTION.

183
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:40,880
IT WASN'T A

184
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:41,880
MEDICAL ABORTION.

185
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:42,880
IT WAS
NECESSARY AND -

186
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:44,360
I'M SURE SHE WAS AN AMAZING
SHAPE TO HAVE SURGERY

187
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:45,810
PERFORMED ON HER.

188
00:09:45,810 --> 00:09:49,260
RIGHT, SUFFERING FROM
LEUKEMIA.

189
00:09:49,260 --> 00:09:53,410
I DO NOT WISH BEING A WOMAN IN
EL SALVADOR ON ANYONE.

190
00:09:53,410 --> 00:09:55,610
THAT COUNTRY ABSOLUTELY
NEEDS OUR SOLITARY AND

191
00:09:55,610 --> 00:09:57,190
SUPPORT.

192
00:09:57,190 --> 00:10:00,350
WHICH LEADS ME TO MY FINAL POINT
WHICH IS EVERYONE'S A WHILE

193
00:10:00,350 --> 00:10:03,079
IN THIS COUNTRY, JUSTIFIABLY,
PEOPLE SAY OH MY GOD, LOOK

194
00:10:03,079 --> 00:10:07,050
AT THE WAY RADICAL MUSLIMS KEEP
TREAT WOMEN, WHETHER IT'S

195
00:10:07,050 --> 00:10:11,079
THE TALIBAN AND IN AFGHANISTAN
OR OUR ALLIES LIKE SAUDI ARABIA.

196
00:10:11,079 --> 00:10:15,721
WELL, THERE'S CHRISTIANS SHARIA
LAW AS WELLNESS CHRISTIAN

197
00:10:15,721 --> 00:10:19,910
TALIBAN AS WELL AND THEY TREAT
WOMEN HORRIBLY AS WELL LIKE

198
00:10:19,910 --> 00:10:22,620
IN CASES LIKE THIS.

199
00:10:22,620 --> 00:10:24,970
AND IF YOU ARE OFFENDED THAT I
AM CALLING A CHRISTIAN

200
00:10:24,970 --> 00:10:27,720
SHARIA LAW, THAT IS A SAD DAY
FOR YOU.

201
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:29,620
THAT IS LITERALLY WHAT IT IS.

202
00:10:29,620 --> 00:10:32,259
SEVERAL PEOPLE WHO ARE NOT
CHRISTIANS AND DON'T BELIEVE

203
00:10:32,259 --> 00:10:35,950
WHAT YOU BELIEVE, I DON'T CARE
WHAT YOUR RELIGION IS.

204
00:10:35,950 --> 00:10:39,480
I DON'T CARE THAT MUSLIMS
THINK I SHOULDN'T DRAW THE

205
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:43,260
PROPHET MOHAMMED, THAT'S YOUR
OPINION AND I'M NOT MUSLIM.

206
00:10:43,260 --> 00:10:46,120
YOU THINK WOMEN SHOULDN'T HAVE
AN ABORTION.

207
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:47,519
THEN YOU DON'T HAVE AN ABORTION.

208
00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:50,990
I AM NOT INTERESTED IN YOUR
SHARIA LAW WHETHER YOU ARE

209
00:10:50,990 --> 00:10:52,390
MUSLIM OR CATHOLIC.

210
00:10:52,390 --> 00:10:55,251
IN THIS CASE IT WAS THE CATHOLIC
CHURCH SPECIFICALLY PUSH

211
00:10:55,251 --> 00:10:57,040
FORWARD ON THIS BILL.

212
00:10:57,040 --> 00:11:00,759
BY THE WAY, YOU ARE EVEN RUN BY
YOUR OWN BIBLE TAUGHT IN

213
00:11:00,759 --> 00:11:03,759
THE BIBLE, HE SAYS IT IS
PRO-ABORTION.

214
00:11:03,759 --> 00:11:08,449
GOD SAYS IF YOUR WIFE CHEATED ON
YOU, GIVE HER A POTION AND

215
00:11:08,449 --> 00:11:10,730
IF USE IF YOU THINK SHE CHEATED
ON YOU AND IF SHE ABORTS

216
00:11:10,730 --> 00:11:13,279
THE BABY, GREAT, AND MEAN SHE
DID CHEAT ON YOU AND IT'S A

217
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:14,709
GOOD THING WE KILLED THAT BABY.

218
00:11:14,709 --> 00:11:16,759
READ THE BIBLE, IT IS THE
NUMBERS.

219
00:11:16,759 --> 00:11:17,759
I DIDNíT SAY THAT,

220
00:11:17,759 --> 00:00:00,000
GOD SAID THAT.
