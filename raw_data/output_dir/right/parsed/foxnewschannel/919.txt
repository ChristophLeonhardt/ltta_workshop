>> Martha: YESTERDAY WHEN
ROBERT ROSENSTEIN WAS DELIVERING
THE IG REPORT TO THE
WHITE HOUSE, AT THAT SAME MOMENT
PRETTY MUCH BACK HERE IN
NEW YORK, THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S
OFFICE HAS SAID THEY WILL USE
QUOTE EVERY LEGAL TOOL TO FIGHT
TRUMP'S AGENDA, FILED A LAWSUIT
AGAINST TRUMP FOUNDATION.
THE SUIT TO SPECIFICALLY NAMES
THE PRESIDENT'S CHILDREN ALONG
WITH THE PRESIDENT, DON JR.,
ERIC AND IVANKA, ACCUSES THE
FOUNDATION OF A LEGAL CONDUCT
AND UNLAWFUL COORDINATION WITH
THE TRUMP PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN.
NEW YORK ATTORNEY GENERAL
BARBARA UNDERWOOD WHO TOOK OVER
THAT POSITION AFTER ERIC
SCHNEIDERMAN RESIGNED IN
DISGRACE AMID REPORTS THAT HE
HAD ABUSED WOMEN, SAYS THIS.
THE TRUMP FOUNDATION WAS A
LITTLE MORE THAN A CHECKBOOK FOR
PAYMENTS FOR MR. TRUMP OR HIS
BUSINESSES TO NONPROFITS,
REGARDLESS OF THEIR PURPOSE OR
LEGALITY.
UNDERWOOD IS SEEKING 2.8 MILLION
IN RESTITUTION PLUS PENALTIES
AND WANTS THE FOUNDATION
DISSOLVED.
WHICH, BY THE WAY, THE PRESIDENT
WANTED TO DO MONTHS AGO WHEN HE
RAN FOR OFFICE BUT THEY SAID
THEY HAD TO KEEP IT OPEN SO THEY
COULD KEEP THE INVESTIGATION
OPEN.
THE PRESIDENT NOW SAYS HE WILL
NOT SETTLE THIS CASE.
THIS IS HIS FORMER CAMPAIGN
MANAGER, GOOD TO SEE YOU CORY.
WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT THIS
SUIT?
>> I THINK THIS IS POLITICS AT
ITS VERY WORST.
WHAT WE HAVE SEEN IS, ERIC
SCHNEIDERMAN THOUGHT HE WAS
GOING TO MAKE HIS POLITICAL
CAREER GOING AFTER DONALD TRUMP
AND HIS FAMILY AT THE FOUNDATION
WHILE AT THE SAME TIME ASKING
FOR DONATIONS WHEN HE WAS
RUNNING FOR OFFICE.
THAT'S A HYPOCRISY OF NEW YORK
POLITICS.
NOW YOU LOOK AT THE
ATTORNEY GENERAL HAS SAID
RECENTLY ABOUT THIS
ADMINISTRATION.
BATTLING THE WHITE HOUSE IS THE
MOST IMPORTANT WORK I HAVE EVER
DONE.
THAT'S WHAT THE ATTORNEY GENERAL
OF NEW YORK HAS SAID.
SO IF YOU DON'T THINK THAT HER
ATTACKS ON THE TRUMP FOUNDATION
ARE A POLITICAL VENDETTA, THEN
NOTHING IS.
SHE'S ABUSING HER POWER AS
ATTORNEY GENERAL TO GO AFTER A
FOUNDATION THAT HAS DONATED TENS
OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS TO
CHARITABLE CAUSES, AND
SPECIFICALLY THOSE TO HELP
VETERANS.
>> Martha: ERIC SCHNEIDERMAN
DIDN'T REALLY USE HIS OFFICE AT
ALL TO INVESTIGATE THE CLINTON
FOUNDATION, HE WAS A SUPPORTER
OF HILLARY CLINTON BUT DID NOT
CHOOSE TO USE THE OFFICE THE
OFFICES RESOURCES TO LOOK INTO
THAT AT ALL.
IN TERMS OF THE CAMPAIGN AND
WHAT THEY ARE ACCUSING THE
CAMPAIGN OF, IT DOES POINT TO
YOU DIRECTLY WITH REGARD TO THE
IOWA CAUCUSES.
THE EMAIL THAT YOU WROTE TO ALAN
WEISEL BERG, AND THE SUBJECT IS,
VETERANS CHARITIES.
IT SAYS, IS THERE ANYWAY WE CAN
MAKE SOME DISBURSEMENTS THIS
WEEK WHILE IN IOWA, SPECIFICALLY
ON SATURDAY?
THEY ARE CLAIMING THE FOUNDATION
WAS USED TO FOLLOW CASH TO
CERTAIN ORGANIZATIONS IN ORDER
TO, I GUESS, CURRY FAVOR AHEAD
OF THE CAUCUSES.
WHAT DO YOU SAY ABOUT THAT?
>> I'VE NEVER SPOKEN TO ANYONE
FROM THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S
OFFICE, AND THEY'VE NEVER
CONTACTED ME.
IF PEOPLE WERE REALLY CONCERNED
ABOUT A FOUNDATION, HILLARY
CLINTON'S FOUNDATION RAISED
$500 MILLION FROM COUNTRIES LIKE
QATAR AND KUWAIT AND GAVE 15% OF
THEIR MONEY FOR PROGRAMMATIC
REQUESTS.
15% OF THE $500 MILLION THEY
GAVE AWAY.
THE TRUMP FOUNDATION BY CONTRAST
RAISED $18.8 MILLION OVER 30
YEARS AND GAVE AWAY
19.2 MILLION.
THEY GAVE AWAY ACTUALLY MORE
MONEY THAN THEY HAD EVER RAISED,
THEY HAVE ZERO OVERHEAD.
IF YOU LOOK AT WHAT THE TRUMP
FOUNDATION HAS BEEN GIVEN, THEY
GAVE $1,001,000 TO THE
MARINE CORPS AND THE LAW
ENFORCEMENT ASSOCIATION.
THAT IS THE ASSOCIATION THAT IS
TASKED WITH, IF YOU DIE IN THE
LINE OF DUTY AS A UNITED STATES
MARINE OR LAW ENFORCEMENT
OFFICER, THIS IS A FOUNDATION
THAT FUNDS YOUR KIDS'
FOUNDATION.
THE GREEN BERET FOUNDATION, MAY
BE SALES FOUNDATION.
THE PREMIER FOUNDATION, THE 20
TO KILL FOUNDATION WHICH IS
DESIGNED TO PREVENT THE 22
INDIVIDUALS WHO KILL THEMSELVES
EVERY DAY AFTER THEY COME BACK,
FROM SUICIDE.
THIS IS WHERE THE TRUMP MONEY
WENT.
I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY THERE IS
ANY QUESTION THAT MR. TRUMP AND
HIS COMPANY THAT HE CONTROLLED
PERSONALLY DONATED OVER
$8 MILLION TO THIS FOUNDATION
OVER THE LAST 30 YEARS, BECAUSE
THAT IS THE CHARITABLE
INDIVIDUAL THAT HE IS AND HE
SHOULD BE PRAISED FOR THE WORK
HE HAS DONE.
>> Martha: SO IN TERMS OF ANY
SUGGESTION THAT THE CAMPAIGN WAS
USING THAT MONEY IN ANY WAY
OTHER THAN A CHARITABLE
DONATION, TO THAT YOU SAY?
>> MARTHA, TO THE BEST OF MY
KNOWLEDGE, AND I'M SURE OF THIS.
ALL THE MONEY THAT THE TRUMP
FOUNDATION GAVE, GAVE IT TO
RECOGNIZE FIVE OH 13C CHARITIES
IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAW.
NO ONE HAS EVER ACCUSED US OF
DOING OTHERWISE.
>> Martha: AND HE SAID HE WILL
FIGHT THIS, WHICH IS BASICALLY
HIS ML WHEN THESE KINDS OF
THINGS COME UP.
RIGHT?
>> YOU HAVE TO FIGHT.
THIS IS SOMEONE USING THEIR
OFFICE, IN THIS CASE, THE
ATTORNEY GENERAL OF NEW YORK.
USING HER OFFICE TO GO AFTER THE
TRUMP FOUNDATION WHICH -- THEY
OFFERED TO CLOSE A FOUNDATION A
YEAR AND A HALF AGO.
THE NEW YORK ATTORNEY GENERAL'S
OFFICE RIGHT NOW IS HOLDING
ALMOST $2 MILLION OF FOUNDATION
MONEY THAT THEY CAN'T DISPERSE
