after much anticipation US President Donald Trump made good on a signature campaign promise solidifying his America first agenda I am announcing today that the United States will withdraw from the Iran nuclear deal this was a horrible one-sided deal that should have never ever been made the u.s. negotiated the agreement with Iran in 2015 along with the United Kingdom France Germany China and Russia to limit Iran's nuclear program in exchange for sanctions relief with the announcement the United States now reimpose is tough economic sanctions on Iran's oil and banking sectors that had been lifted arguing Iran did not live up to its end of the agreement we have definitive proof that this Iranian promise was a lie even though US intelligence the United Nations and European allies maintain Iran has been compliant under the agreement Trump cited a recent Israeli report that Iran had not been truthful about its activities before entering into the deal Trump also argues the agreement should have dealt with Iran's military pursuits in the region and its ballistic missile program Capitol Hill the top Senate Democrat disagrees and to me the right thing to do would have been to try and come up with our allies with an agreement on those issues and let the nuclear part of this continue as is because it's not being violated in any way Trump's predecessor Barack Obama the man who oversaw the deal called Trump's decision a serious mistake in a statement Obama said without the agreement the United States could eventually be left with a losing choice between a nuclear-armed Iran or another war in the Middle East deed former Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders believes the United States is already on that path the road to the war in Iraq did not simply begin in 2003 it was laid down brick by brick over a number of years ironically as the president tore up the nuclear deal with Iran Secretary of State Mike Pompeo was on his way to North Korea laying the groundwork for a nuclear deal with Pyongyang President Trump indicated the United States is willing to negotiate a new deal with Iran but he says this decision also signals the United States will no longer make what Trump calls empty threats Kimberly halc√≥n al Jazeera at the White House
