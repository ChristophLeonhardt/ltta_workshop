you got the top two finishers in each congressional district who will go on to compete in the general no matter what party they belong to and that is a concern for Democrats because so many of them are running and some of these competitive primaries their fear is Dems split the vote and then the Republicans end up on top Jacob Soboroff is live in California's 39th district to talk us through this look at still early in California maybe not a million people behind you at the polling place that you're at Jacob but it's breakfast time there they're coming in how they got to talk to you my polling place for us because everybody is casting their critical vote here it's like a golf tournament in the 39th district and actually this is one that the Republicans targeted very specifically because Hillary Clinton won here despite the fact that ed woods was the Republican Congress are now with him stepping down they see it as a big opportunity but because there are so many Democrats running here and they have this top two primary system and might throw things into chaos with two Republicans finishing on top I wouldn't talk to some of those Democrats running and the Republican who may ultimately win watch this so this campaign headquarters this is head clown nice and that's cool yeah this is where the work kids done to flip the seat flipping this seat California's thirty ninth was once considered highly likely by national Democrats after Hillary Clinton won here in 2016 and longtime Republican congressman ed Royce announced his retirement but there are six Democrats running in the primary and no clear front-runner so Democrats Sam Jamal is calling every last voter he can before the polls close on Tuesday hello is grant available hello is James available nope nope hi this is Sam Jamal I'm running for Congress in our community and wanted to call to introduce myself feel pretty good yeah that was always the best calls do you get the sense of the national Democrats really know what's going on in the district I think what they're missing the cues is they're just looking at demographics we are a very diverse district and this is a district people will be open to supporting Democrats but you still have to make the case do you know she might be your next Congress person doing back there had a night Democrat dr. mat√© ran who came to the u.s. from Vietnam as a refugee when she was nine thinks she can connect to the diverse residents of this majority minority district but she's got another problem to deal with it's a tree that the national Democrats asked you to get out of the race well they just called me and said look you know the we did a poll the poll shows that you know you don't have any viability so you should consider dropping out was a crazy thing to hear oh my gosh it was an I said well first we'll give you that right and secondly how dare you how dare you it's a funny thing to hear from a Democrat oh I know I didn't want to do that there are actually more Republicans than Democrats running in the 39th but one of them is endorsed by the outgoing congressman and she seems to be the clear front-runner former California Assemblywoman young Kim welcome to 39th Street this is the district the Democrats think is one of the most flippable in the country not so look this is a variant a business district I've talked to every single one about and they come and talk to me about the issues that they care about and I fail to come to a young young CEO come to me that we haven't had a voice in Asian American voice in Washington for too long they feel like them they're people here don't represent them yes young Kim they know you she's famous here she's a big star are you gonna are you gonna are you gonna vote for her beautiful are you gonna vote for her on Tuesday yes it's amazing everywhere you go people know you I mean of course she says what do you think are the is the fact that the Democrats targeted this district based on its diversity I mean were they overconfident I don't know what they're thinking but to be honest with you this is a district not just because it's an Asian American they should automatically think that they're gonna be a voting Democrat the idea that Democrats might have thought diversity equals Democrat what do you say to that not so fast not so fast not so fast so Democrat Sally thought diversity was going to be one of the keys to winning here it also turns out that turnout might be one of the keys with so many candidates running it's pretty quiet here this morning it is early as you said but in the meantime they do something nice that I think that you'll appreciate you can take a ballot selfie after you're done casting your vote Aly Jackson I know you're a fan of
