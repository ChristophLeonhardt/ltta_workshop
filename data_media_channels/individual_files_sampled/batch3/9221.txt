ADMINISTRATION IS BEYOND BELIEF. IT HAS TO STOP. HERE NOW DALLAS, MOVIE PRODUCER AND CEO OF CENTER STATE. GOOD TO HAVE YOU WITH US. THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME. Martha: INTERESTING READING ABOUT YOUR HISTORY. YOU HAVE HAD A LOT OF SUCCESS IN HOLLYWOOD AND DOING INDEPENDENT FILMS INVOLVED IN A LOT OF WORK THAT PEOPLE THERE WOULD RESPECT AND ADMIRE. SO WHAT STARTED TO HAPPEN IN YOUR LIFE THAT YOU THOUGHT, YOU KNOW WHAT? I'M TIRED OF THIS WHOLE RAP? YEAH, IT WAS TWO THINGS. FIRST OF ALL, IN MY HOLLYWOOD LIFE AND CAREER, I NOTICED THAT THERE WAS A STUDIO SYSTEM IN PLACE WHERE THE WRITER AND DIRECTOR WOULD BRING THEIR PRODUCT TO THE EXECUTIVES AND THE STUDIOS AND ASK FOR FINANCING AND THE SCRIPTS WOULD BE PUT THROUGH A DIFFICULT FUSION PROCESS, THE CREATIVE EXECUTIVES WOULD PUT THEIR, YOU KNOW, DERIVATIVE NOTES ONTO THE SCRIPT. AND WHAT WOULD COME OUT THE OTHER SIDE WOULD BE SOMETHING THAT I DIDN'T REALLY RESPOND TO VERY MUCH, I THINK AS FILM PRODUCERS, WE NEED TO SUPPORT THE CREATIVE VISION OF THE WRITER AND DIRECTOR AFUSIVELY. OTHERWISE DON'T MAKE THE MOVIE END OF STORY. THE OTHER THING WAS I LOST BOTH OF MY PARENTS IN TERRIBLE SITUATIONS OF DOMESTIC GUN VIOLENCE. AND AFTER THAT HAPPENS TO ONE PERSON, YOU DON'T HAVE A LOT OF TIME FOR B.S. Martha: I'M SURE YOU DON'T. I'M SURE YOU DON'T. AND WHEN YOU TAKE A LOOK AT THE WAY THINGS ARE BEING DONE IN HOLLYWOOD. YOU PICKED UP AND BROUGHT YOUR FAMILY TO TEXAS WHERE YOU GROUP. YOU SAY NOW YOU HAVE SOMETHING IS IT CALLED THE TENNESSEE'S COUSIN'S ROLE OR TEXAS COUSIN'S ROLE HOW YOU FIGURE OUT WHETHER OR NOT SOMETHING IS GOING TO WORK IN THE REST OF AMERICA. YEAH, WHAT I DO, MY BOTH SIDES OF MY FAMILY IS FROM LOUISIANA. AND WHAT I HAVE IS THE LOUISIANA COUSIN TEST. AND WHAT I'LL DO IS I WILL TEXT MY COUSIN THE NAME OF THE ACTOR THAT I'M ABOUT TO CAST IN THE MOVIE AND IF THEY KNOW WHO THAT ACTOR IS. IT TENDS TO GIVE ME A GOOD SENSE OF WHETHER THE MOVIE WILL DO WELL IN AUDIENCES OUTSIDE OF L.A. AND NEW YORK. SO LOUISIANA COUSIN TEST HAS PROVEN. Martha: GIVE ME AN EXAMPLE OF SOMEBODY THAT THEY WOULD GO NO, THAT DOESN'T NOTHING FOR ME? YEAH, I MEAN, THE EXAMPLE I HAVE GIVEN IN THE PAST, TIMOTHY SHALAMAY FOR EXAMPLE. ALTHOUGH IS HE VERY TALENTED ACTOR AND NOMINATED. HE JUST DOESN'T. Martha: HE IS NOT RESONATING WITH THE COUSINS IN TENNESSEE. IS HE NOT RESONATING WITH THAT CROWD. Martha: MAKING MONEY OFF THESE MOVIES. YOU SAY IF YOU DO A MOVIE ABOUT SOMEONE WHO, YOU KNOW, HAD A FAMILY MEMBER WHO WAS INJURED OR WRONGED AND THEN THEY UNJUSTLY GO TO PRISON AND THEN THEY COME OUT AGAIN, AND THEY GO BACK AND, YOU KNOW, SHOOT THE PEOPLE WHO DID THIS TO THEM, YOU'RE GOING TO MAKE MONEY ON YOUR MOVIE. DEPENDING ON HOW YOU DISTRIBUTE IT? YEAH. YEAH. THAT WAS THOSE WERE PREDOMINANTLY MY PREVIOUS FILMS WITH STONE COLD STEVE AUSTIN. IF YOU JUST MAKE A MOVIE WHERE IT IS IT'S UNCOMPROMISING AND UNFORGIVING, AND DOESN'T REALLY WORRY TOO MUCH ABOUT POLITICAL CORRECTNESS OR FILTERING YOUR OWN PERSONAL POLITICS THROUGH THE FILM, I THINK WHAT YOU ARE FIND IS THAT TRUE MOVIE BECOMES MORE AUTHENTIC AND I THINK THAT AUDIENCES CRAVE AUTHENTIC EXPERIENCES AND ENTERTAINING EXPERIENCES. SO THAT'S WHAT I FOUND AND IT'S PROVEN TO BE VERY SUCCESSFUL FINANCIAL MODEL FOR US. Martha: I'M ALMOST OUT OF TIME. I NEED TO SQUEEZE THIS IN. YOU HAVE A MOVIE YOU ARE WORKING ON ABOUT A GIRL IN A SCHOOL SHOOTING INCIDENT WHO TURNS THE GUN ON THE SHOOTER AND KILLS HIM. AND YOU SAID YOU MIGHT HAVE DIFFICULTY CASTING THAT ROLE. HOW IS THAT GOING? YEAH. IT'S CALLED RUN, HIDE, FIGHT. IT'S A TERRIFIC SCRIPT ABOUT A YOUNG GIRL WHO DECIDES TO FIGHT BACK INSTEAD OF RUN AWAY FROM A TERRIBLE SITUATION. AND SHE LEANS ON HER EXPERIENCES OF HUNTING WITH HER FATHER OVER THE SEVERAL YEARS THAT SHE WAS A TEENAGER. AND, I FOUND THAT THE SCRIPT IS INCREDIBLE. PEOPLE REALLY LOVE IT, BUT THE ACTORS HAVE GIVEN PAUSE AND THEIR MANAGERS HAVE SORT OF AT TIMES TALKED THEM OUT OF STARRING IN THE MOVIE OUT OF FEAR OF BACKLASH. Martha: BECAUSE THEY WILL BE HOLD GO AHEAD A BEINOLD GO AHEAD A BEINGLD GO AHEAD A BEING T GO AHEAD A BEING THEO AHEAD A BEING THE GAHEAD A BEING THE GUNEAD A BEING THE GUN AD A BEING THE GUN ANDA BEING THE GUN AND IDEA OF GOOD PERSON WITH A GUN ENDING A BAD SITUATION FOR SOMEBODY ELSE HOLDING ONE ON
