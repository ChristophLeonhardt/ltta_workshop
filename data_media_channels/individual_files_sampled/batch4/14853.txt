the punk band Green Day is less Punk than ever not only do they look like 15 year old emo kids from 2008 but let's face it they can't pull off that punk look the same way Johnny Rotten can at 62 but their attacks on Trump are among the most Pro establishment boring and pandering public statements I've ever seen remember they're lame no Trump no KKK no fascist us a performance at the AMA well that was one of the most miserable pro-establishment performances that I ever saw on television and it looks like the whining far-left activists in England have also picked up on them because they are vying for Green Day's American Idiot to top the charts during Trump's visit Fox reports protestors who oppose Trump and his policies started a campaign to get people in the UK to buy and stream the Green Day song American Idiot so that when Trump lands on Thursday the song will be at the top of the music charts and it seems to be working this single is already number one on Amazon UK's best seller list and as of Tuesday it's climbed to number 18 on the UK's Official Charts it is interesting that this seems to be working so far given that there are tens of millions of people in the UK that are also pushing for footballs coming home to reach the top of the charts during the World Cup even with the huge efforts by the football supporters people are still buying this American Idiot crap regardless of whether it works the pandering will no doubt not have the intended effect remember when celebrities came together to support Hillary Clinton with their fear-mongering and comedy routines against Trump and the cringe-worthy fight song music video celebrity pandering turns the public off and reminds them of the rift between the lives of normal people and famous people and I for one welcome it because when your enemy is making a mistake you don't interrupt them I hope that the punk community also doesn't take kindly to this punk is about saying something without having to ask permission to say it and making music that you want to make it's about being anti-establishment it is evident to me that Green Day has taken on more the opinion of America's vocal far-left mainstream culture they have the side of the media institutions in Hollywood and those campaigning to make American Idiot the number one in the UK are basking in their celebrity glory there is nothing Punk about aiding an establishment that hates the little people there's nothing Punk about pushing a far left authoritarian narrative that has invaded our government schools Hollywood at popular culture President Trump is more Punk than Green Day at this point standing up too far leftists and neo-cons and establishing a firm pro-american agenda the only American idiots I see are Green Day and their fans all over the world if you want to see more from me and the rest of the rebel team like and subscribe you
