She's beautiful.
She's smart.
She always lights up the room.
>> He loves me for me.
When I'm down inside, he's there for me.
>> I can tell you're really nervous honey.
>> Yeah, I am.
>> It's okay to be nervous.
I got butterflies now.
Yeah speed limit's 35 buddy.
Learn how to drive.
There's no way.
How am I going to fit these balloons in the
car?
>> Could I take my hand out and just hold
them?
Do you wanna see what I'm saying?
>> Yeah, I hope you don't let them go.
>> I won't, I'll just hold them.
Okay, I got it.
>> Got them?
>> I got them, don't worry.
>> For nearly 30 years, Lori Sousa worked
at a sheltered workshop in
North Providence Rhode Island called Training
Through Placement, or TTP.
It was a place where people with intellectual
disability did basic repetitive jobs.
One day about five years a new guy showed up,
Peter Maxmean.
>> I saw him and I don't know this might
sound a little funny.
Not to me it doesn't.
I looked at him I said I'm gonna marry that
guy.
That's my soul mate.
They worked next to each other as they tested
and cleaned used remote controls.
Sheltered workshops like theirs were once
seen as
a progressive alternative to institutions.
A place where people could be trained for
employment.
But most of the workers at TTP including
Laurie, rarely got jobs on the outside.
The remained in the workshop, sometimes for
decades earning pay that average $1.57 an
hour.
>> I always used to say to the bosses I'd be
like I wanna go out, I wanna go out and
get a job I want to get trained for a job.
Put me out there I can do it.
In my opinion they never listened.
Laurie was sitting at the front desk one day
last year,
when federal investigators showed up.
The sheltered workshop was ultimately accused
of underpaying it's clients, and
of violating their civil rights by keeping
them segregated.
Now the State of Rhode Island is developing a
new approach to help people with
disability thrive in the workplace and in
society.
An approach that could become the model for
the rest of the country.
As a result, Peter and Lori are finding their
place in the outside world together.
>> I think I asked for the blue bow tie,
right?
I believe so.
>> Correct.
>> Okay.
I was living in a group home in Smithfield.
Wow, this is probably the best I've looked in
a long time.
I was taken away from my biological mom when
I was like three years old.
I went to special needs school.
 And you look at me now, you'd
never think.
So it was just back and forth between
different agencies and into a group home.
To now being independent in my own apartment,
for the last four years.
I know how to dance.
What?
You do the moonwalk like this.
>> A non-profit organization called Fed Cap
has helped Peter find a well paying job at a
state hospital.
>> 14.81 an hour.
The housekeeping, custodial slash janitors.
I do love my job.
I love the people that I work with.
This is my boy right here.
>> This guy's a great guy right here.
>> They always bust my chops every single
day, but, you know, and I give it right back.
 And it does help having the job being
able to pay for all this stuff.
Okay thank you very much.
>> Good  luck.
God bless you both.
>> You did such a great job.
>> And now since I have the car, it's even
that's a blessing.
Cuz imagine trying to go on a bus with a
gown.
 They'd think I'm a little loopy.
>> 
>> I think he wants me to wear this one.
Cuz this one goes over your head like this.
Have to be a little taller because I'm a
little short thing.
And I got to be a little taller so I can give
him a kiss.
>> But things haven't been as easy for
Lori.
She's still struggling to find a job.
>> They put me in a Hampton Inn.
You gotta go in there, do the bathrooms,
the beds, there was a time limit how long you
could be in the room.
When you got a really filthy room and
there's stuff all over the place how you
supposed to do that under thirty minutes?
>> She missed two days of work and was let
go.
Mike, he's getting married tomorrow.
>> I'm surprised you didn't say I feel sorry
for you.
>> 
>> A lot of people have already told me that.
>> Down to one income, they must carefully
budget for
everything, including their wedding day.
>> Don't worry about it, Maria.
Do you like those?
Oh, those are nice.
>> Oh wait, that's cute Ma.
They don't have to be big heels.
Those are nice.
>> Yeah, look, this is the price.
>> I like these.
I like these.
>> How much?
>> I don't like them shoes I at home.
>> How much are they?
14.99.
>> Hey come here.
You wanna em?
>> Yeah, do you have you have enough money?
That's the thing.
>> Don't worry about it.
I'm good.
Let me see what I have on my card now,
don't worry about it honey.
Yeah I can do it honey, do it.
>> You sure?
>> Yes.
>> .
>> .
>> Honey I have an extra $53.
>> Okay.
There's only $16 bucks honey.
>> No, it's all right. . >> Hey
Ma, I'll be able to kiss him.
>> Come here.
Relax.
It's gonna be a wonderful day.
I've been told that, you know, if you want a
really good wedding, you gotta.
It takes at least a year to be able to plan
it and,
to be able to do it in three months and it's
still gonna come out great.
How you doing buddy?
>> All right how are you?
>> It's my wedding day today.
>> Oh, congratulations.
>> Thank you.
>> Just don't let go of them.
I'll try to drive as slowly as possible.
I won't go over the speed limit.
 Unbelievable.
>> $0.90 times 24, $24.
>> Well at least the cake won't blow away.
>> This is how we're gonna walk, okay
Brendan?
My moment is gonna be when I'm walking down
the aisle with my son.
When I see him standing there for me.
>> Walk nice and steady, I got big heels.
All right, you got it?
>> This is where it all begins right here,
the foundation.
And this is very good foundation.
>> Yeah, should be 'cause she had it extra
tight.
>> Should be a little tight.
How you doing?
>> We're doing good though.
We're gonna, I knew it wasn't gonna start
exactly.
Nothing starts exactly on time, does it?
>> Nah.
>> Hold on, let the bride go in first.
>> Come on Mike.
>> YOu just have to walk easy.
>> That's it, just calm down.
>> Press one.
Yeah babe, when I'm with you,
standing there when the priest
talks.
I could take my shoes off.
I don't need my shoes.
>> Yeah, cuz they're gonna kill you if not.
>> Oh, I'm forgetting something.
>> What?
>> The marriage license is missing.
The Justice of the Peace is looking to get
paid,
and more than 50 guests are waiting in their
apartment building's community room.
>> All we need is the bouquet
>> Ooh look at you handsome.
>> I have to see if there's anything,.
>> Ballons!
>> In the gift thing first, cuz I've spent
everything else on the wedding.
Can you see if they've put anything into that
the gift box yet?
>> Had to go out to one table to a next table
to a next table.
>> But I didn't know, because I thought he
said I could pay for it afterwards.
>> Shh!
>> Ladies and gentleman.
At this time I'd like to welcome you
all here to Lauren and Peter's wedding.
 Ladies and gentlemen,
please rise at this time.
>> We have all come here today not only to
join two people together.
But to recognize that such a joining has
already taken place in their hearts.
This is your marriage, not something created
by the state or church.
It's yours to define.
Yours to live.
.
>> She looked beautiful even before she put
this on.
The couple will take a one day honeymoon.
Then Tuesday morning Peter will be back at
work.
All I wanna do, is grow old with you.
Sorry.
I'll miss you, kiss you, 
Give you my coat when you are cold,
I wanna grow old with you.
>> Sorry about the mic though.
