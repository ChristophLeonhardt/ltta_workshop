THE REPORT ON THE DOJ AND THE

WE HAVE BEEN TOLD THAT THE

A LOT OF GROUND TO COVER.

30
00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:17,919

00:01:21,089 --> 00:01:22,223
IN THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE IN

00:01:22,223 --> 00:01:23,491
A PREVIOUS ADMINISTRATION THAT

34
00:01:23,491 --> 00:01:24,926
WOULD NOT DEAL WITH THOSE

KNOW FROM THE PAST HE CAN SPEAK

40
00:01:31,699 --> 00:01:36,271
SECONDLY, WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE

44
00:01:42,677 --> 00:01:47,815
GET INFORMATION AND IT TURNED

45
00:01:47,815 --> 00:01:51,819

00:01:52,353 --> 00:01:54,556

THIS LEAK YESTERDAY.

53
00:02:05,133 --> 00:02:19,647
TO SAY THAT COMEY WAS

54
00:02:19,647 --> 00:02:24,018
INSUBORDINATE IS THAT A BIG

55
00:02:24,018 --> 00:02:24,385
BOMBSHELL?

56
00:02:24,385 --> 00:02:27,055
>> MAYBE IT'S BEEN BUILT UP TOO

57
00:02:27,055 --> 00:02:27,355
MUCH.

58
00:02:27,355 --> 00:02:31,626
THERE IS AN ENORMOUS AMOUNT TO

00:02:31,626 --> 00:02:31,926

BLOCKED.

66
00:02:45,206 --> 00:02:46,541
I THINK THEY ARE EITHER TO GET

67
00:02:46,541 --> 00:02:48,543
OUT A NUMBER OF THESE THINGS

68
00:02:48,543 --> 00:02:50,578

00:02:50,578 --> 00:02:52,547
WITH THE ELECTION CYCLE.

70
00:02:52,547 --> 00:02:56,417

71
00:02:56,417 --> 00:02:56,751

UPSHAW WITH PAPADOPOULOS.

74
00:03:05,426 --> 00:03:06,694
HIS WIFE SAID THEY WERE TRYING

75
00:03:06,694 --> 00:03:08,763
TO ENTRAP HIM AND USE HIM TO

76
00:03:08,763 --> 00:03:09,530
PUSH THIS INVESTIGATION FORWARD.

77
00:03:09,530 --> 00:03:12,100
WHAT IS YOUR REACTION TO THAT?

78
00:03:12,100 --> 00:03:14,836
>> WELL, LEGALLY IT'S NOT

79
00:03:14,836 --> 00:03:15,236
ENTRAPMENT.

80
00:03:15,236 --> 00:03:16,671
IF THERE IS ANY INDICATION THAT

81
00:03:16,671 --> 00:03:18,106
THE INDIVIDUAL IS WILLING TO DO

82
00:03:18,106 --> 00:03:20,408
WHATEVER THE CONDUCT IT.

83
00:03:20,408 --> 00:03:26,281
I THINK SHE IS USING ANOTHER

84
00:03:26,281 --> 00:03:28,716
DEFINITION OF ENTRAPMENT.

85
00:03:28,716 --> 00:03:31,853
GEORGE PAPADOPOULOS MADE SOME

86

DRUNKEN COMMENT TO THE

00:03:36,658 --> 00:03:38,526
AUSTRALIANAMBASSADOR TO THE U.N.

88
00:03:38,526 --> 00:03:41,262

00:03:41,262 --> 00:03:41,696

REPORTED THAT HE KNEW THERE WERE

92
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:47,068
A LOT OF CLINTON EMAILS.

93
00:03:47,068 --> 00:03:49,037
THEN THEY BACKED OFF AND SAID

94
00:03:49,037 --> 00:03:50,338
THEY HAD DIRT ON HILLARY.

95
00:03:50,338 --> 00:03:51,773
THAT STORY SHIFTED.

96
00:03:51,773 --> 00:03:54,342
THAT'S A BIG DIFFERENT, SOMEONE

97
00:03:54,342 --> 00:03:56,678
HAS DIRT ON HILLARY AND SOMEONE

98
00:03:56,678 --> 00:03:57,645
KNEW EMAILS WERE HACKED AND

99
00:03:57,645 --> 00:04:01,182
WOULD BE RELEASED.

100
00:04:01,182 --> 00:04:03,518

CASES REPORTED ON BY THE NEWS

103
00:04:08,456 --> 00:04:10,291
MEDIA, ABOUT 50% WAS RIGHT.

104
00:04:10,291 --> 00:04:12,593
IT'S NOT NECESSARILY THE

105
00:04:12,593 --> 00:04:13,995
JOURNALIST'S FAULT.

106
00:04:13,995 --> 00:04:15,330
SOMETIMES THE SOURCES ARE TOO

107
00:04:15,330 --> 00:04:16,264
FAR REMOVED.

108
00:04:16,264 --> 00:04:18,199
THEY DON'T HAVE AS MUCH AS THE

109
00:04:18,199 --> 00:04:21,636
INFORMATION AS YOU WOULD LIKE.

110
00:04:21,636 --> 00:04:27,508
LET'S NOT JUMP TO CONCLUSIONS.

111
00:04:27,508 --> 00:04:29,210
THERE WAS SOME INDICATION THAT

112
00:04:29,210 --> 00:04:31,079
PAPADOPOULOS NEW THAT RUSSIA HAD

113
00:04:31,079 --> 00:04:33,348
INFORMATION HE WAS TRYING TO GET

114
00:04:33,348 --> 00:04:36,417
ACCESS TO THAT.

115
00:04:36,417 --> 00:04:39,587
AT THAT POINT IT'S INCUMBENT ON

116
00:04:39,587 --> 00:04:41,055
THE FBI TO INVESTIGATE THAT TO

117
00:04:41,055 --> 00:04:42,790
SEE IF THERE IS A NATIONAL

118
00:04:42,790 --> 00:04:43,524
SECURITY RISK.

119
00:04:43,524 --> 00:04:44,459
>> Laura: YOU DON'T THINK

120
00:04:44,459 --> 00:04:45,593
ANYBODY HAPPENED BEFORE THAT

121
00:04:45,593 --> 00:04:48,162

WE DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT WAS

126
00:04:57,572 --> 00:04:57,872
ABOUT.

127
00:04:57,872 --> 00:05:01,209
THAT ONE UNREDACTED TEXT.

128
00:05:01,209 --> 00:05:03,311
THAT'S WEIRD STUFF.

129
00:05:03,311 --> 00:05:04,078
MAYBE THAT'S INNOCENT.

130
00:05:04,078 --> 00:05:08,616
MAYBE THEY IS LURES ALL OVER THE

131
00:05:08,616 --> 00:05:08,916

138
00:05:25,133 --> 00:05:26,467
SOURCE AND GATHER INFORMATION.

139
00:05:26,467 --> 00:05:28,403
THEY HAVE TO ABIDE BY THE

140
00:05:28,403 --> 00:05:28,870
GUIDELINES.

141
00:05:28,870 --> 00:05:31,606

COUNTER INTELLIGENCE

THE RULES.

>> WHEN YOU SAID IT'S INCUMBENT,

149
00:05:44,185 --> 00:05:46,254
THAT'S HOG WASH.

150
00:05:46,254 --> 00:05:48,322
THE FACT IS EVERY SINGLE

00:05:48,322 --> 00:05:50,691
POLITICAL CAMPAIGN, THE SENATE,

152
00:05:50,691 --> 00:05:51,959

ALL LOOKING FOR DIRT.

154
00:05:53,428 --> 00:05:54,962
THEY WANT IT WHEREVER THEY WILL

00:05:54,962 --> 00:05:55,229
GET.

156
00:05:55,229 --> 00:05:58,399
IT THEY PAY FOR IT.

157
00:05:58,399 --> 00:05:59,801

TIME THERE WAS A CREDIBLE

163
00:06:10,978 --> 00:06:12,814
ATTEMPT TO GET DIRT, YOU WOULD

164
00:06:12,814 --> 00:06:16,150
BE INVESTIGATING HUNDREDS AND

165
00:06:16,150 --> 00:06:16,517
HUNDREDS.

>> COME ON.

167
00:06:17,485 --> 00:06:18,586
IT'S DIFFERENT WHEN THE SOURCE

168
00:06:18,586 --> 00:06:20,021
OF THE INFORMATION IS A FOREIGN

169
00:06:20,021 --> 00:06:21,923
COUNTRY THAN IF THE SOURCE OF

170
00:06:21,923 --> 00:06:22,723
THE INFORMATION IS SOMEONE

171
00:06:22,723 --> 00:06:24,025
WITHIN THE COUNTRY.

172
00:06:24,025 --> 00:06:25,693
>> A VAGUE ALLEGATION THAT THERE

173
00:06:25,693 --> 00:06:27,261
MAY BE SOMETHING IS VERY

174
00:06:27,261 --> 00:06:29,464
DIFFERENT THAN WELL, WE HAVE

175
00:06:29,464 --> 00:06:30,665
RUSSIAN INTELLIGENCE.

176
00:06:30,665 --> 00:06:33,100
LET'S REMEMBER, IN THIS CASE.

177
00:06:33,100 --> 00:06:37,071
AT SOME POINT THE DEPARTMENT OF

178
00:06:37,071 --> 00:06:39,774
JUSTICE KNEW THAT THE DNC AND

179
00:06:39,774 --> 00:06:42,577
HILLARY CLINTON WERE PART OF THE

180
00:06:42,577 --> 00:06:44,812
SOURCE OF THAT.

181
00:06:44,812 --> 00:06:46,714
>> LONG BEFORE THE ELECTION.

182
00:06:46,714 --> 00:06:48,082
>> I AM UNCOMFORTABLE WITH THE

183
00:06:48,082 --> 00:06:52,587
IDEA THAT THE FBI IS RUNNING AN

184
00:06:52,587 --> 00:06:55,223
INVESTIGATION BASED ON WHAT A

185
00:06:55,223 --> 00:06:55,990
CAMPAIGN TEAM MEMBER SAID

186
00:06:55,990 --> 00:06:56,991
OVERHEARD IN A BAR.

187
00:06:56,991 --> 00:06:58,125
I THINK THAT'S PECULIAR.

188
00:06:58,125 --> 00:07:01,095
IF WE WENT TO A BAR AND HAD A

189
00:07:01,095 --> 00:07:02,964
CONVERSATION AND I AM ON A

190
00:07:02,964 --> 00:07:03,965
CAMPAIGN AND YOU ARE.

191
00:07:03,965 --> 00:07:05,566
THE FBI SAYS LET'S RUN AN

ESPECIALLY DURING A CHARGED

00:07:16,310 --> 00:07:17,278

209
00:07:34,061 --> 00:07:37,098
HAD NO IDEA WHO WAS INVOLVED.

210
00:07:37,098 --> 00:07:38,266
THEY DIDN'T THINK AT THE
