1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:03,090
as the latest Chad we've been through a
lot of these over the years and I don't

2
00:00:03,090 --> 00:00:08,519
recall many times hearing 185 miles per
hour no the closest I can remember even

3
00:00:08,519 --> 00:00:14,429
reporting on was high n and that was in
the eastern Pacific there way out to the

4
00:00:14,429 --> 00:00:18,750
west near the Philippines and that was
195 and we had Anderson Cooper on the

5
00:00:18,750 --> 00:00:23,070
ground there for weeks covering that
event this thing went right over Barbuda

6
00:00:23,070 --> 00:00:27,810
it did damage it we have not heard from
that Island in now six hours and also on

7
00:00:27,810 --> 00:00:32,040
over st. Martin and Anguilla and it is
truly right now over the British Virgin

8
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:35,850
Islands there is an island right there
Virgin Gorda bitter end Yacht Club right

9
00:00:35,850 --> 00:00:40,950
there I don't understand this but Sir
Richard Branson is on that Island right

10
00:00:40,950 --> 00:00:45,180
there in a wine cellar I think when he
gets out of there later today I think he

11
00:00:45,180 --> 00:00:51,239
will tell us what a unwise decision that
was to ride this 185 mile per hour wind

12
00:00:51,239 --> 00:00:54,539
out everything will be demolished on
those islands there in the BBI

13
00:00:54,539 --> 00:00:58,620
and probably not faring much better will
be the US Virgin Islands from Charlotte

14
00:00:58,620 --> 00:01:02,250
O'Malley all the way up to Megan's Bay
this will be a devastating impact we

15
00:01:02,250 --> 00:01:06,420
know about parts of Bermuda they're
saying at some spots as the hurricane

16
00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:10,229
went over ripped all the vegetation out
of the ground there's not a bit of

17
00:01:10,229 --> 00:01:15,360
vegetation left so where does it go from
here it gets into the Turks and Caicos

18
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:19,020
but there's not much land there so we
don't expect too much of a loss of power

19
00:01:19,020 --> 00:01:25,229
still 160 then 155 and maybe making a
turn toward Florida I say maybe because

20
00:01:25,229 --> 00:01:29,340
if we look at all these models they all
turn this storm very hard to the right

21
00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:34,079
job very hard but when does that happen
does that happen right over Monroe

22
00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:39,420
County and on up into miami-dade that
would be likely the most devastating

23
00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:43,979
hurricane in US history does it turn to
the right and go over the Bahamas for

24
00:01:43,979 --> 00:01:48,750
the Bahamas a devastating hit here or
doesn't wait and get all the way west of

25
00:01:48,750 --> 00:01:53,399
Key West and get west of here this is
less likely this is somewhere in the

26
00:01:53,399 --> 00:01:58,439
middle and this right here is as most of
the computer models now are talking a

27
00:01:58,439 --> 00:02:03,149
slight right turn just to the east of
Miami Beach but still Miami Beach could

28
00:02:03,149 --> 00:02:06,930
have winds of 150 could you imagine what
that would do to the high-rises and the

29
00:02:06,930 --> 00:02:10,649
buildings and everything on Miami Beach
that would be a real mess now that's

30
00:02:10,649 --> 00:00:00,000
still four and a half days away
so keep that in mind
