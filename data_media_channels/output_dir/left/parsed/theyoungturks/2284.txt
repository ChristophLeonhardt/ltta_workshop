MIKE HUCKABEE ONE DAY HE WAS
NAMED THE FORMER GOVERNOR OF
ARKANSAS Ã± HE ONE DAY WAS NAMED
TO THE BOARD OF THE COUNTRY
MUSIC ASSOCIATION FOUNDATION,
THE FUNDRAISING ARM OF THE
COUNTRY MUSIC ASSOCIATION, AND
THE NEXT DAY HE WAS GONE, WHY?
THERE WERE PEOPLE WHO STEPPED UP
AND HAD A PROBLEM WITH HIS
STANCE ON GAY MARRIAGE.
MIKE 
HUCKABEE SAYS HE WAS FORCED
TO RESIGN AND THEN HE WENT
TO FOX NEWS TO CRY ABOUT IT.
HERE IS WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE, TAKE
A LOOK AT THIS VIDEO.
>>TODAY THE NEW DIRECTION OF THE
LEFT IS IN THE NAME OF TOLERANCE
BE INTOLERANT, IN THE NAME OF
LOVE-HATE PEOPLE, AND THE NAME
OF DIVERSITY DEMAND CONFORMITY
BECAUSE THAT IS WHERE WE ARE.
IS NOT TO SAY I DISAGREE AND I
WISH THIS PERSON WOULD CHANGE
HIS MIND, IT IS LET'S PUT THEM
OUT OF BUSINESS, LET'S CLOSE THE
STORE, LET'S NOT ALLOW HIM TO
CONTINUE TO OPERATE A BUSINESS.
LET'S DAMAGE THEM
PROFESSIONALLY, LET'S HURT
HIS BRAND.
IT IS ALL ABOUT DESTROYING THE
OTHER SIDE RATHER THAN
DISAGREEING WITH THE OTHER SIDE.
THAT IS NOT THE KIND OF AMERICA
WHERE THE FIRST AMENDMENT
RAINS AND PEOPLE ARE FREE.
IT IS LET'S DESTROY EVERYONE WHO
DOESN'T AGREE WITH ME.
>> SO YOU NOT BEING ON A BOARD
FOR COUNTRY MUSIC, YOU WILL
LIVE, THAT IS A CHOICE THAT THEY
ARE MAKING.
IF YOU GET YOUR WAY PASSING
THE LAWS THAT DISCRIMINATE
LEGALLY AGAINST GAY AMERICANS,
THEN THEY DON'T HAVE A
CHOICE AND IT IS EXCLUSION BY
DEFINITION.
YOU ARE LEGALLY GOING AFTER GAY
AMERICANS AND THAT IS 
WHAT
WE ARE TRYING TO PREVENT.
>>DON'T PLAY THE VICTIM HERE.
I'M GOING TO PREVENT ALL OF THAT
BUT I'M GOING TO TELL YOU I
LOVE YOU BROTHER IF YOU WOULD
JUST CHANGE EVERYTHING
ABOUT YOUR IDENTITY THAT I WOULD
LOVE YOU.
I'M NOT INTERESTED 
IN YOUR LOVE.
