1
00:00:00,179 --> 00:00:04,470
>>DIRECTOR QUENTIN TARANTINO IS
SAYING THAT HE KNEW ENOUGH TO DO

2
00:00:04,470 --> 00:00:07,879
MORE THAN HE DID WITH REGARD TO
THE ALLEGATIONS OF SEXUAL

3
00:00:07,879 --> 00:00:10,560
MISCONDUCT COMING UP AGAINST
HARVEY WEINSTEIN.

4
00:00:10,560 --> 00:00:11,560
IN A RECENT

5
00:00:11,560 --> 00:00:12,560
INTERVIEW HE SAYS THE FOLLOWING
--

6
00:00:12,560 --> 00:00:31,080
>> 

7
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:34,691
YOU GUYS MAY REMEMBER THAT HE
DATED ACTRESS MIRA SORVINO, HE

8
00:00:34,691 --> 00:00:48,540
SAYS OF THAT --

9
00:00:48,540 --> 00:00:53,280
>> HE DOES A LOT OF EXPLAINING,
IT'S IMPORTANT TO TAKE THE FULL

10
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:55,830
CONTEXT OF HIS STATEMENTS, AND
PART WHAT HE SAYS IS --

11
00:00:55,830 --> 00:01:05,030
>> 
HE ALSO CALLS OUT HIS MALE

12
00:01:05,030 --> 00:01:06,030
COUNTERPARTS IN THE

13
00:01:06,030 --> 00:01:07,030
INDUSTRY, HE SAYS --

14
00:01:07,030 --> 00:01:18,140
>> 

15
00:01:18,140 --> 00:01:22,590
THIS IS SUCH A CONFLICTING
STATEMENT TO READ BECAUSE HE'S

16
00:01:22,590 --> 00:01:24,900
ADMITTING TO HIS OWN
CULPABILITY, HE'S SAYING I WAS

17
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:30,259
WRONG, YET IT IS SO -- WHEN
SOMEONE APOLOGIZES I'M INCLINED

18
00:01:30,259 --> 00:01:34,670
TO BELIEVE THEM BUT AT THE SAME
TIME IT'S SO FRUSTRATING TO HEAR

19
00:01:34,670 --> 00:01:37,790
FROM PEOPLE WHO KNEW IN THE
INDUSTRY, AND THAT'S SOMETHING

20
00:01:37,790 --> 00:01:41,750
WE'VE TALKED ABOUT A LOT ON THIS
SHOW, PEOPLE KNEW, HE'S SAYING

21
00:01:41,750 --> 00:01:46,479
PEOPLE KNEW AND THEY LET THIS
SICKNESS, THIS TOXICITY, LAY

22
00:01:46,479 --> 00:01:50,060
DORMANT IN THE INDUSTRY IN ABUSE
WOMEN FOR SO LONG.

23
00:01:50,060 --> 00:01:51,060
HIS OWN

24
00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:52,290
GIRLFRIEND WAS A VICTIM OF THIS.

25
00:01:52,290 --> 00:01:54,049
IT'S INCREDIBLY TROUBLING, YET

26
00:01:54,049 --> 00:01:57,710
AT THE SAME TIME I'M ENCOURAGED
THAT AT LEAST WE ARE HEARING

27
00:01:57,710 --> 00:02:02,000
FROM MEN TRYING TO HOLD EACH
OTHER ACCOUNTABLE.

28
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
WHERE YOU

29
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
FALL ON THIS?

30
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:08,610
>>I WAS JUST GOING TO MENTION
ONE THING, WHICH IS WEIRD, I'M

31
00:02:08,610 --> 00:02:09,908
SURE IT EXTENDS BEYOND
HOLLYWOOD, AND THAT'S THE

32
00:02:09,908 --> 00:02:15,029
PROFESSIONAL BIND THAT TARANTINO
IS IMPLICITLY REFERENCING HERE.

33
00:02:15,029 --> 00:02:18,579
HE IS SAYING I WANTED TO WORK
WITH HARVEY WEINSTEIN, AND

34
00:02:18,579 --> 00:02:21,889
THAT'S WHY I WAS IN A TOUGH
POSITION, AND THAT'S WHY I

35
00:02:21,889 --> 00:02:23,049
DIDN'T DO MORE.

36
00:02:23,049 --> 00:02:25,980
AS GRACE WAS
SAYING, HIS OWN GIRLFRIEND WAS A

37
00:02:25,980 --> 00:02:29,609
VICTIM OF THIS, HE COULD HAVE
SAID OH MY GOD, WE HAVE TO GO TO

38
00:02:29,609 --> 00:02:32,409
THE POLICE, THIS IS A SERIOUS
SITUATION AND I'VE HEARD OF

39
00:02:32,409 --> 00:02:35,999
OTHER SITUATIONS TOO. IS THAT
TOO MUCH TO HAVE ASKED HIM TO

40
00:02:35,999 --> 00:02:36,999
DO?

41
00:02:36,999 --> 00:02:41,769
BUT HE FELT A PROFESSIONAL
PRESSURE, MAYBE HE RATIONALIZED

42
00:02:41,769 --> 00:02:46,239
IT AS I DON'T THINK THE COPS
WILL DO MUCH AND WEINSTEIN WILL

43
00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:50,700
CRUSH ME, I'LL NEVER GET ANOTHER
MOVIE MADE -- AND THAT'S THE

44
00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:53,790
PROFESSIONAL BIND HE FOUND
HIMSELF IN, AND IT'S WEIRD TO

45
00:02:53,790 --> 00:02:57,319
HEAR HIM TALK ABOUT IT NOW AS HE
LOOKS BACK ON WHAT HE COULD

46
00:02:57,319 --> 00:02:58,319
HAVE DONE.

47
00:02:58,319 --> 00:03:03,159
>>I THINK IT'S SICKENING TO HERE
THE LEVEL OF HONESTY BECAUSE I'M

48
00:03:03,159 --> 00:03:06,340
SURE THAT WAS THE BIND HE FELT,
THEN YOU REALIZE PEOPLE WERE

49
00:03:06,340 --> 00:03:10,169
VALUING THEIR PROFESSIONAL
CAREERS AND WEIGHING THAT WITH

50
00:03:10,169 --> 00:03:13,799
ALLEGATIONS THAT THEY KNEW TO BE
TRUE OF ASSAULT AT THE HANDS OF

51
00:03:13,799 --> 00:03:14,799
THIS MOVIE MOGUL.

52
00:03:14,799 --> 00:03:18,180
>>THIS IS THE TIPPING POINT,
THIS IS A DEFINING MOMENT FOR

53
00:03:18,180 --> 00:03:22,379
HOLLYWOOD, BECAUSE WHAT YOU HAVE
BOTH SAID IS RIGHT.

54
00:03:22,379 --> 00:03:23,379
PEOPLE HAVE

55
00:03:23,379 --> 00:03:26,930
CARED MORE ABOUT THE BOTTOM
LINE, MORE ABOUT THEIR PROFIT,

56
00:03:26,930 --> 00:03:30,659
THEIR RETURN, THEN THE SAFETY OF
THEIR COLLEAGUES AND WOMEN IN

57
00:03:30,659 --> 00:03:31,659
THIS INDUSTRY.

58
00:03:31,659 --> 00:03:32,659
AND MEN.

59
00:03:32,659 --> 00:03:33,900
THERE
ARE YOUNG MEN WHO HAVE ALSO BEEN

60
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:38,459
PREYED ON BY OLDER PEOPLE IN THE
INDUSTRY, SO IT IS CONFLICTING,

61
00:03:38,459 --> 00:03:42,859
I HAVE TROUBLE WITH THIS, BUT I
WANT TO APPLAUD THE WOMEN WHO

62
00:03:42,859 --> 00:03:45,439
HAVE FOUND THE COURAGE AND
STRENGTH TO COME FORWARD AND

63
00:03:45,439 --> 00:03:48,209
TALK ABOUT THEIR EXPERIENCES.

64
00:03:48,209 --> 00:03:49,530
AS
DISAPPOINTING AS IT IS TO HEAR

65
00:03:49,530 --> 00:03:53,019
THAT TARANTINO KNEW ABOUT THIS
AND COULD HAVE DONE MORE, I'M SO

66
00:03:53,019 --> 00:03:56,469
GLAD SOMEONE IS FINALLY COMING
OUT AND SAYING YES I HAVE EGG ON

67
00:03:56,469 --> 00:03:59,900
MY FACE, I KNEW THIS WAS
HAPPENING, BECAUSE WE SAW THOSE

68
00:03:59,900 --> 00:04:04,959
COWARDLY STATEMENTS IMMEDIATELY
AFTER THE STUFF CAME OUT,

69
00:04:04,959 --> 00:04:06,419
AND I WAS JUST DISGUSTED.

70
00:04:06,419 --> 00:04:12,139
>>BECAUSE I THINK THE TRUTH, AS
MUCH AS IT STINGS, FEELS BETTER

71
00:04:12,139 --> 00:04:15,529
THAN THE LIP SERVICE WE GOT IN A
LOT OF THE STATEMENTS THAT WERE

72
00:04:15,529 --> 00:04:18,539
RELEASED OF MAN THAT YOU KNEW
KNEW.

73
00:04:18,539 --> 00:04:20,839
WE ALL KNEW THE KNEW, I'M

74
00:04:20,839 --> 00:04:26,449
SAYING KNEW TOO MUCH, BUT IT'S
REFRESHING AND SICKENING AT THE

75
00:04:26,449 --> 00:04:31,819
SAME TIME FOR TARANTINO TO SAY I
WAS WRONG, I MESSED UP, AND I'M

76
00:04:31,819 --> 00:04:35,189
CALLING ON MY MALE COUNTERPARTS
IN THE INDUSTRY TO SAY WE NEED

77
00:04:35,189 --> 00:04:39,770
TO DO BETTER, AND THE FIRST STEP
IS ACKNOWLEDGING THAT YOU MESSED

78
00:04:39,770 --> 00:04:45,080
UP FOR YEARS AND ALLOW THIS TO
GO ON, NOW I FEEL LIKE WE CAN

79
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:49,060
GROW, BUT WE CAN'T GROW FROM LIP
SERVICE, FROM SOMEONE GOING MY

80
00:04:49,060 --> 00:04:53,599
THOUGHTS AND PRAYERS ARE WITH
THE VICTIMS, I HAD NO IDEA, SO

81
00:04:53,599 --> 00:04:57,629
SAD, I HAVE DAUGHTERS --
THAT DOESN'T HELP US.

82
00:04:57,629 --> 00:04:59,600
WE ARE GROWING FROM THIS
STATEMENT, THE INDUSTRY

83
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:00,600
WILL GROW.

84
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:02,590
>>I CAN'T DO ANYTHING WITH THE
STATEMENT THAT YOUR PUBLICIST

85
00:05:02,590 --> 00:05:08,050
TOLD YOU TO SAY, SO I WOULD LOVE
TO SEE MORE PEOPLE COME OUT AND

86
00:05:08,050 --> 00:05:13,490
HAVE THE SAME KIND OF HONESTY
AND SELF REFLECTION TARANTINO

87
00:05:13,490 --> 00:05:14,490
HAD.

88
00:05:14,490 --> 00:05:19,629
>>IT'S FUNNY, NOT FUNNY HA HA,
JUST INTERESTING, FUNNY

89
00:05:19,629 --> 00:05:23,870
INTERESTING TO THINK BACK ON THE
BILL COSBY CASE AND HOW YOU

90
00:05:23,870 --> 00:05:29,400
NEEDED THAT FIRST, THAT HANNIBAL
BURRESS MENTIONED, YOU GUYS ALL

91
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:34,229
KNOW HE'S A RAPIST -- AND ALL OF
A SUDDEN THE NATION TURNED ITS

92
00:05:34,229 --> 00:05:37,319
HEAD AT ONCE AND FOCUSED ON
THAT, AND IN THIS CASE YOU

93
00:05:37,319 --> 00:05:41,930
NEEDED THOSE FIRST ACCOUNTS TO
COME FORWARD AND BE IN THE

94
00:05:41,930 --> 00:05:46,710
PUBLIC RECORD, AND THEN THIS
TORRENT BEGAN.

95
00:05:46,710 --> 00:05:48,129
AND I SUSPECT IT

96
00:05:48,129 --> 00:05:50,669
WILL CONTINUE, AND THEN BROADEN
TO INCLUDE SOME OF THE MEN,

97
00:05:50,669 --> 00:05:52,789
WHICH IS WHY I MENTION IT.

98
00:05:52,789 --> 00:05:55,180
AT
SOME POINT IT GETS SAFER TO COME

99
00:05:55,180 --> 00:05:56,180
OUT.

100
00:05:56,180 --> 00:05:57,180
>>ABSOLUTELY.

101
00:05:57,180 --> 00:06:00,729
QUITE EARLY ON
THEY ARE JUST SAYING I WANT A

102
00:06:00,729 --> 00:06:04,480
NONCOMMITTAL STATEMENT, I DON'T
WANT TO GET INVOLVED, I DON'T

103
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:05,720
WANT ANY OF THIS ON ME.

104
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:11,169
>>THAT IS WHY WE NEED TO -- THIS
IS ONE THING, QUENTIN TARANTINO

105
00:06:11,169 --> 00:06:22,190
COMING OUT, BUT REALLY THE
COURAGEOUS IS IN THE SURVIVORS

106
00:06:22,190 --> 00:06:26,509
COMING OUT.

107
00:06:26,509 --> 00:06:28,699
WE NEED TO CELEBRATE
THE PEOPLE COMING FORWARD WHO

108
00:06:28,699 --> 00:06:31,919
ARE THE TIPPING POINT, NOT THE
PEOPLE WHO CAME OUT ON THE

109
00:06:31,919 --> 00:06:32,919
CREST OF THE WAVE.

110
00:06:32,919 --> 00:06:34,979
THAT SAID I THINK THIS IS A GOOD
GROWING MOMENT.

111
00:06:34,979 --> 00:06:38,280
>>I WOULD RATHER SOMEONE WEIGHT
LIKE HE DID AND COME OUT WITH

112
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:41,039
SOMETHING REAL THAT WE CAN DO
SOMETHING WITH.

113
00:06:41,039 --> 00:06:47,849
>>DON'T WAIT AND SPEED DELL YOUR
PUBLICIST.

114
00:06:47,849 --> 00:06:54,349
>>BUT THINK ABOUT HOW LOCKDOWN
HE WAS, WHEN I THINK ABOUT MIRA

115
00:06:54,349 --> 00:06:57,849
SORVINO, SHE IS COMING BACK AND
TELLING HIM THIS HAPPENED, AND

116
00:06:57,849 --> 00:07:00,919
ON SOME LEVEL FOR HIM TO
CONTINUE TO DO BUSINESS WITH THE

117
00:07:00,919 --> 00:07:04,270
WEINSTEIN COMPANY, SHE IS HAVING
TO SAY DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT

118
00:07:04,270 --> 00:07:07,979
HONEY, IT'S OKAY, I'M USED TO
THIS, BELIEVE ME DIRECTORS DO IT

119
00:07:07,979 --> 00:07:11,499
ALL THE TIME -- IT SPEAKS TO THE
CULTURE OF HOLLYWOOD THAT

120
00:07:11,499 --> 00:07:14,849
SOMEHOW HE WAS ABLE TO CONTINUE
TO DO BUSINESS, AND SHE WASN'T

121
00:07:14,849 --> 00:07:15,889
BOTHERED BY IT.

122
00:07:15,889 --> 00:07:20,540
SHE WASN'T
SAYING HOW DARE YOU DO THIS?

123
00:07:20,540 --> 00:00:00,000
THERE IS COMPLICITY ALL AROUND
TO BE SHARED.
