because his Democratic challenger Beto O'Rourke is running a very tight race very very tight race and so Cruz has decided to do something that I think makes him look so pathetic and I enjoy every minute of it he's begging Donald Trump for help oh all right so he telegraphed his need to the president during a campaign stop here's what he said I would certainly welcome his meaning Trump support and I hope to see him in Texas I think we are likely to see the president down in Texas before the election so look I love this because if you can recall during the primaries before you know the lead-up to the 2016 election Cruz and Trump didn't get along because Trump said some horrible things not only about Cruz but about Cruz's family we have evidence take a look his father was with Lee Harvey Oswald prior to us wolves being ridiculous what what is his right prior to his being shot what was he doing with Lee Harvey Oswald right before the shooting spilling the beans is quite simple when it comes to Heidi Cruz she is a bush operative she worked for the architect of NAFTA so spilling the beans on Heidi Cruz simply means that her entire career has been spent working against everything Ted Cruz says that he stands for it's not easy to take me off I don't get angry often but you mess with my wife you mess with my kids that'll do it every time Donald you're a sniveling coward and leave Heidi the hell alone they asked Ted Cruz serious question well what do you think of waterboarding is it okay and honestly I thought he'd say absolutely and he didn't she just said a terrible thing you know what she said shout it out cuz I don't want to she said I never expect to hear that from you again she said he's a that's tired her I am NOT a habit of supporting people who attack my wife and attack my father pretty please in the present I expect to come down and help me pretty please my name is reek and you don't look when he's doing the fake tough-guy stuff that's what consumers you can't see through that look we know when if there's someone on our side who's a fraud you can't see that that guy's a fraud how incredibly weak he is and that when he's doing the tough guy use never letting Karen I will defend my what he looks like a politician won't even Lee what do you think he's gonna defend his wife okay it would be as someone who's also a wife not to ted cruz but to a great man if my husband did what ted cruz did i would be i would be turned off for the rest of my life like i would never sleep with my husband again if someone let's go to graphic 57 this is what Trump had tweeted about Ted Cruz's wife during the election okay Ted Cruz's wife on the Left Melania Trump obviously on the right a picture is worth a thousand words and they says no need to spill the beans so spill the beans controversy is not interesting but the point of this was clearly she's ugly oh my god never gonna sleep with my husband again it's over so I mean that's an open-handed slap boy you're gonna sit there and bleed or gonna do something about it instead let's go to page picture 64 here this is what Ted Cruz did not even like two years later during the campaign he was unmanned after he called said oh I'm gonna fight Trump and I called him a coward and he wouldn't endorse um in the convention and guess what happened the donors slammed the door and Cruz's face that's a literal story after his speech at the convention he went upstairs to kiss the ring of the Mercer's that were his top donors that had given 13 million dollars during the primary to Cruz and now they've switched over to team Trump and when he didn't endorse Trump they slammed a door in his face and immediately thereafter show me the picture again Cruz was said okay I endorse I endorsed I'm so sorry and then he went and did phone banking for Donald Trump that's my favorite picture in the world okay in Texas you're gonna have that so-called man represent you I thought you guys were tough in Texas mmm not so tough anymore oh my god and so now for him to be a coatroom comes and helps me in Texas oh you're the saddest man in America it's Beto versus beta oh okay so and if you don't know I love doing this story too in the in went I'm named their hundred most influential people of then of course they named Donald Trump that's normal the person who wrote a fawning description of Donald Trump it could have been anybody he made Cruz do it oh he's reek and Cruz came in and said yes yes and he wrote a funny like Donald Trump is so great and he's so wonderful I mean he called your wife ugly but he also said your dad was a murderer he said your dad was involved in the conspiracy to kill JFK who would forgive that I mean look I would rather retire from politics than bow my head to that guy but that's not in his nature Ted Cruz is and he did what he every Republican does projection when he called Trump a sniveling coward what he was saying is I am a sniveling coward and he did was sniveling cowards do ah he offered his submission he cooked himself so bad or Roark is now within one point and of course what do sniveling cowards do they panic so he's in a panic that this guy is gonna beat him and he's asking for help from Papa Trump uh I love how pathetic that is that's Ted Cruz in a nutshell two easy ways follow Young Turks want us hit the subscribe
