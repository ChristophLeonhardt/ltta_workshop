so the new book is devil's bargain Steve Bannon Donald Trump and storming or the presidency that's coming out now bloomberg businessweek Joshua Greene wrote it and it has some unbelievable revelations in it and a lot to do with Steve Bannon but also a story about Paul manna for tonight now at the time Paul Manafort is Donald Trump's campaign manager and Daily Mail is now got sections from this they're reporting in now it's all over the press including me died as well so man there was a story in the paper at the time this is the middle of the campaign where they say the Donald Trump if you want to talk to him in you're part of his campaign it's hard to go in and get a meeting with him and he doesn't pay attention if you really want them to pay attention you have to actually get on cable news because all he does is watch cable news all day and if you're on cable news then he'll pay attention so this story gets out in the papers and Trump's apparently furious about it and thinks that mana Ford did it so that's where they pick it up here to fight the fight between Trump and man afford his campaign manager at the time came about over a news report which said Trump's advisers did TV interviews to get his attention because he watches so much cable so then the fight goes like this the Trump shouted at Manta Ford how can anybody allow an article that says your campaign is all fucked up you think you've got to go on TV to talk to me you treat me like a baby am I like a baby to you I sit there like a little baby and watch TV and you talk to me am i a fucking baby Paul Oh what I would give to have that conversation on video I would watch that a thousand times over okay yes by the way I have an answer for you President Trump you are a baby because who talks like that when you get so upset first of all you do watch cable all day long even now that you're president you watch it all day long and everybody knows that it's been reported a million times and everybody knows that you have no attention span right now as president you ordered presidential daily briefings no longer be all the way up to four pages that they be only one page and have pictures and graphs on him and then later when they were preparing you for a European Treat trip they know your attention span is so small and your mind is so tiny that they had to start preparing you in tweet sized information you are a baby but it's not quite fair to babies because they're innocent Oh where's you're a grown-ass man so Paul Manafort was right with that strategy and then you turn around when you find out about it how do you react with a huge hysterical screaming fit like a baby so they say the room fell silent nobody knew what to do because the reality is the president is a child he has temper tantrums he can't pay attention he's all about ego and by the way Paul Manafort removed from campaign manager just about a week later now there were other reasons for that removal as well we found out that he'd gotten paid a lot of money by the Russians although Trump not one to mind dealing with the Russians too much I'm not sure that was the reason there are a number of factors but overall the president has such a ridiculous ego and it cannot be tweaked in any way shape or form and he does not make decisions based on what is right for the country or even at the time what's right for his campaign he doesn't based on his ego and he acts like a child and if you call him out on it he throws a temper tantrum help us build an independent media together come join us TYT Network comm slash join
