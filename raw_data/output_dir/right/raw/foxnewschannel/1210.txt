00:00:06,790 --> 00:00:07,791
>> ARTHEL: AS WE MARK NATIONAL

2
00:00:07,791 --> 00:00:09,126
CANCER SURVIVOR'S DAY, PRESIDENT

3
00:00:09,126 --> 00:00:10,861
TRUMP IS PUTTING THE SPOTLIGHT

4
00:00:10,861 --> 00:00:12,763
ON THE VAST NUMBER OF AMERICANS

5
00:00:12,763 --> 00:00:14,397
FIGHTING THE DEADLY DISEASE.

6
00:00:14,397 --> 00:00:15,665
THE PRESIDENT SAYS IN A

7
00:00:15,665 --> 00:00:18,502
STATEMENT, QUOTE, TO PROVIDE

8
00:00:18,635 --> 00:00:20,670
AMERICANS AND THEIR FAMILIES, I

RECENTLY SIGNED INTO LAW THE

FEDERAL RIGHT TO TRY

11
00:00:23,974 --> 00:00:24,374
LEGISLATION.

12
00:00:24,374 --> 00:00:26,510
THIS NEW LAW GIVES THOSE FACING

13
00:00:26,510 --> 00:00:29,045
A TERMINAL ILLNESS EXPANDED

14
00:00:29,045 --> 00:00:30,714
OPTIONS FOR CARE AND TREATMENT

15
00:00:30,714 --> 00:00:33,083
THAT COULD SAVE THEIR LIVES.

16
00:00:33,083 --> 00:00:36,119
MY NEXT GUEST IS A CANCER

17
00:00:36,119 --> 00:00:38,054
SURVIVOR HERSELF AND SHE HAS

18
00:00:38,054 --> 00:00:40,924
ACCEPTED THE NOMINATION TO BE A

NOW OVER THE PHONE FROM LOS

ANGELES.

24
00:00:48,999 --> 00:00:50,600
HER NAME IS KATLYN LINDSEY.

25
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:51,635
ARE YOU THERE?

26
00:00:51,635 --> 00:00:52,903
>> I AM.

27
00:00:52,903 --> 00:00:53,837
HELLO, THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR

28
00:00:53,837 --> 00:00:54,504
HAVING ME ON.

29
00:00:54,504 --> 00:00:56,039
>> ARTHEL: I WANT TO LET

30
00:00:56,039 --> 00:00:59,676
EVERYBODY KNOW YOU'RE MY DEAR

31
00:00:59,676 --> 00:01:00,177
FRIEND AS WELL.

32
00:01:00,177 --> 00:01:01,311
I'M VERY PROUD OF YOU.

33
00:01:01,311 --> 00:01:03,213
YOU ARE ONE OF 20 CANDIDATES

34
00:01:03,213 --> 00:01:04,414
WHICH IS WHY YOU STARTED YOUR

35
00:01:04,414 --> 00:01:05,749
FUND RAISING CAMPAIGN.

36
00:01:05,749 --> 00:01:07,517
TELL US ABOUT YOUR CAMPAIGN,

37
00:01:07,517 --> 00:01:08,885
YOUR GOAL AND WHAT IS IT THAT

38
00:01:08,885 --> 00:01:11,721
YOU'RE HOPING TO ACHIEVE AS A

39
00:01:11,721 --> 00:01:12,055
NOMINEE?

40
00:01:12,055 --> 00:01:15,759
>> IT'S A COMPETITION TO SUPPORT

41
00:01:15,759 --> 00:01:16,860
CANCER RESEARCH AND TO HELP

42
00:01:16,860 --> 00:01:18,061
EVERYONE WHO HAS BEEN TOUCHED OR

43
00:01:18,061 --> 00:01:22,098
WILL BE TOUCHED BY CANCER, ANY

44
00:01:22,098 --> 00:01:23,834
CANCER, AND IT'S 20 CANDIDATES,

45
00:01:23,834 --> 00:01:25,168
A NATIONAL CAMPAIGN.

46
00:01:25,168 --> 00:01:28,672
IT TIES TO ME BECAUSE I HAD

47
00:01:28,672 --> 00:01:29,706
BREAST CANCER.

48
00:01:29,706 --> 00:01:30,807
IT WAS DIAGNOSED ABOUT THREE

49
00:01:30,807 --> 00:01:32,509
YEARS AGO.

50
00:01:32,509 --> 00:01:36,046
AND I UNDERWENT A MASTECTOMY AND

51
00:01:36,046 --> 00:01:37,280
WENT BACK TO MY LIFE.

52
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:38,481
MARCH 8th OF THIS YEAR I FOUND

53
00:01:38,481 --> 00:01:39,816
OUT THE BREAST CANCER CAME BACK

54
00:01:39,816 --> 00:01:41,918
AND THIS IS RIGHT BEFORE MY

55
00:01:41,918 --> 00:01:44,855
CAMPAIGN KICKED OFF.

56
00:01:44,855 --> 00:01:46,356
RESEARCH IS SO IMPORTANT.

57
00:01:46,356 --> 00:01:48,892
MY CASE IS SO RARE, DUE TO MY

58
00:01:48,892 --> 00:01:49,893
AGE.

59
00:01:49,893 --> 00:01:58,768
BUT THERE'S BREAKTHROUGHS IN

60
00:01:58,768 --> 00:01:59,870
IMMUNOTHERAPY AND WE'RE

61
00:01:59,870 --> 00:02:00,971
IMPROVING QUALITY OF LIFE FOR

62
00:02:00,971 --> 00:02:04,241
PATIENTS AND FOR CAREGIVERS.

63
00:02:04,241 --> 00:02:06,643
I THINK THEY HAVE INVESTED OVER

64
00:02:06,643 --> 00:02:08,277
$1.2 BILLION I THINK IN

65
00:02:08,277 --> 00:02:08,711
RESEARCH.

66
00:02:08,711 --> 00:02:09,412
>> ARTHEL: HOW MUCH HAVE YOU

67
00:02:09,412 --> 00:02:10,280
RAISED, KATLYN, SO FAR?

68
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:12,482
>> MY GOAL FOR THE END OF THE

69
00:02:12,482 --> 00:02:15,151
WEEK IS TO HAVE $100,000 AND I'M

70
00:02:15,151 --> 00:02:17,621
VERY, VERY CLOSE TO THAT.

71
00:02:17,621 --> 00:02:18,521
>> ARTHEL: YOU'RE VERY CLOSE TO

72
00:02:18,521 --> 00:02:18,822
THAT.

73
00:02:18,822 --> 00:02:19,990
WHERE ARE YOU RIGHT NOW?

74
00:02:19,990 --> 00:02:23,293
LAST I READ YOU WERE AT $90,000.

75
00:02:23,293 --> 00:02:26,663
>> IT'S A BLIND COMPETITION.

76
00:02:26,663 --> 00:02:28,965
WE CAN'T PUBLICLY SAY HOW MUCH

77
00:02:28,965 --> 00:02:29,466
I'VE RAISED.

78
00:02:29,466 --> 00:02:31,268
I'M VERY CLOSE TO THAT NUMBER.

79
00:02:31,268 --> 00:02:32,135
>> ARTHEL: WE'LL LEAVE IT THERE.

80
00:02:32,135 --> 00:02:35,038
IF YOU WANT TO DONATE, KATLYN'S

81
00:02:35,038 --> 00:02:41,711
WEBSITE IS MWO Y.ORG, MWOY.ORG.

82
00:02:41,711 --> 00:02:43,647
LOOK FOR HER NAME, KATLYN

83
00:02:43,647 --> 00:02:44,147
LINDSEY.

84
00:02:44,147 --> 00:02:46,483
AND HER PICTURE.

85
00:02:46,483 --> 00:02:47,083
TO DONATE.

86
00:02:47,083 --> 00:02:49,085
KATLYN, IS THERE A DEADLINE TO

87
00:02:49,085 --> 00:02:49,419
DONATE?

88
00:02:49,419 --> 00:02:51,154
>> IT WOULD BE END OF THIS WEEK.

89
00:02:51,154 --> 00:02:52,789
SO FRIDAY.

90
00:02:52,789 --> 00:02:53,456
>> ARTHEL: FRIDAY.

91
00:02:53,456 --> 00:02:54,124
OKAY.

92
00:02:54,124 --> 00:02:55,558
WE'LL DEFINITELY GO TOWARDS THAT

93
00:02:55,558 --> 00:02:57,227
GOAL FOR SURE AND WE'RE GOING TO

94
00:02:57,227 --> 00:02:58,295
SURPASS IT.

95
00:02:58,295 --> 00:03:00,697
I WANT TO BACK UP, KATLYN.

96
00:03:00,697 --> 00:03:03,333
YOU STARTED TELLING YOUR STORY

97
00:03:03,333 --> 00:03:06,136
BUT I WANT TO SLOW IT DOWN AND

98
00:03:06,136 --> 00:03:07,871
REMIND EVERYBODY YOUR STORY, THE

99
00:03:07,871 --> 00:03:10,273
BACK STORY IS THAT IN MARCH OF

100
00:03:10,273 --> 00:03:13,009
2015 AT 32 YEARS OLD YOU WERE

101
00:03:13,009 --> 00:03:14,544
DIAGNOSED WITH STAGE 2 BREAST

102
00:03:14,544 --> 00:03:15,345
CANCER.

103
00:03:15,345 --> 00:03:18,281
YOU HAD A MASTECTOMY FOLLOWED BY

104
00:03:18,281 --> 00:03:19,683
EIGHT RECONSTRUCTIVE SURGERIES

105
00:03:19,683 --> 00:03:20,684
AND MULTIPLE PROCEDURES.

106
00:03:20,684 --> 00:03:22,719
THEN YOU WERE GIVEN THE

107
00:03:22,719 --> 00:03:23,086
ALL-CLEAR.

108
00:03:23,086 --> 00:03:24,854
THEN THREE YEARS LATER, MARCH OF

109
00:03:24,854 --> 00:03:27,857
THIS YEAR, 2018, YOU FOUND OUT

110
00:03:27,857 --> 00:03:30,093
THAT YOUR BREAST CANCER HAD COME

111
00:03:30,093 --> 00:03:30,393
BACK.

112
00:03:30,393 --> 00:03:31,895
WHAT HAPPENED NEXT?

113
00:03:31,895 --> 00:03:35,865
>> ALL MY DOCTORS WERE IN SHOCK

114
00:03:35,865 --> 00:03:37,867
BECAUSE A AFTER A MASTECTOMY IT

115
00:03:37,867 --> 00:03:39,369
ISN'T LIKELY THAT CANCER WILL

116
00:03:39,369 --> 00:03:41,504
RETURN ON THE MASTECTOMY SIDE

117
00:03:41,504 --> 00:03:44,341
BUT FOR ME IT DID AND THEY

118
00:03:44,341 --> 00:03:45,442
ADMITTEDLY ACKNOWLEDGED THAT

119
00:03:45,442 --> 00:03:46,543
MORE RESEARCH NEEDS TO BE DONE

120
00:03:46,543 --> 00:03:47,744
ESPECIALLY ON CASES LIKE MINE.

121
00:03:47,744 --> 00:03:50,380
SO THE FIRST TIME I DIDN'T

122
00:03:50,380 --> 00:03:51,181
UNDERGO RADIATION.

123
00:03:51,181 --> 00:03:53,650
THIS TIME I'M CURRENTLY

124
00:03:53,650 --> 00:03:54,451
UNDERGOING 25 ROUNDS OF

125
00:03:54,451 --> 00:03:56,252
RADIATION TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY

126
00:03:56,252 --> 00:03:57,187
GOT ALL THE CELLS.

127
00:03:57,187 --> 00:03:58,788
SO I'M IN THE PROCESS OF THAT

128
00:03:58,788 --> 00:04:02,092
TREATMENT RIGHT NOW AND I'M

129
00:04:02,092 --> 00:04:05,628
TAKING IT DAY BY DAY, BUT ONE OF

130
00:04:05,628 --> 00:04:09,265
THE INTERESTING THINGS WITH THIS

131
00:04:09,265 --> 00:04:11,401
IS THAT WHAT I LEARNED WAS WHAT

132
00:04:11,401 --> 00:04:12,202
ORIGINALLY WAS DISCOVERED

133
00:04:12,202 --> 00:04:14,637
THROUGH BLOOD CANCER RESEARCH,

134
00:04:14,637 --> 00:04:16,439
SINCE BLOOD CANCER IS EASY TO

135
00:04:16,439 --> 00:04:18,575
STUDY, IS NOW BEING TESTED FOR

136
00:04:18,575 --> 00:04:19,809
CLINICAL TRIALS FOR OTHER CANCER

137
00:04:19,809 --> 00:04:20,176
AS WELL.

138
00:04:20,176 --> 00:04:22,112
SO THAT'S WHY THIS ISN'T JUST

139
00:04:22,112 --> 00:04:26,549
FOR ME WITH BREAST CANCER OR FOR

140
00:04:26,549 --> 00:04:27,984
LEUKEMIA OR LYMPHOMA.

141
00:04:27,984 --> 00:04:29,686
IT AFFECTS EVERY TYPE OF CANCER

142
00:04:29,686 --> 00:04:32,389
AND EVERY PERSON.

143
00:04:32,389 --> 00:04:33,823
>> ARTHEL: I'VE KNOWN YOU FOR

144
00:04:33,823 --> 00:04:34,357
MAYBE 20 YEARS NOW.

145
00:04:34,357 --> 00:04:35,859
YOU KNOW I'M SO PROUD OF YOU,

146
00:04:35,859 --> 00:04:38,261
WHAT YOU'RE DOING IS REMARKABLE

147
00:04:38,261 --> 00:04:39,796
AND IT SPEAKS VOLUMES ABOUT YOU,

148
00:04:39,796 --> 00:04:41,698
THE WAY YOU WERE RAISED, AND

149
00:04:41,698 --> 00:04:46,269
YOUR FORTTITUDE AND COMPASSION

150
00:04:46,269 --> 00:04:47,270
AND YOU AS A PERSON.

151
00:04:47,270 --> 00:04:49,205
KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK AND KEEP

152
00:04:49,205 --> 00:04:49,906
FIGHTING THE GOOD FIGHT AND

153
00:04:49,906 --> 00:00:00,000
WE'RE ON YOUR SIDE.
