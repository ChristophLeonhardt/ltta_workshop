[MUSIC]

2
00:00:03,481 --> 00:00:07,275
Well, as I understand, I'm
Cassius Marcellus Clay the sixth.

3
00:00:07,275 --> 00:00:10,081
And my great, great grandfather
was a Kentucky slave, and

4
00:00:10,081 --> 00:00:12,110
he was named after some great Kentuckian.

5
00:00:12,110 --> 00:00:15,043
Cassius Marcellus Clay is
a great name in Kentucky.

6
00:00:15,043 --> 00:00:18,825
And really, where he was from,
where it was all originated,

7
00:00:18,825 --> 00:00:23,772
I couldn't tell you, but since I reached
a little fame in boxing most people want

8
00:00:23,772 --> 00:00:27,010
to know where I'm from and
where did I get that name.

9
00:00:27,010 --> 00:00:30,292
I haven't really checked on it, so I see
that I am going to to have to go looking.

10
00:00:30,292 --> 00:00:31,167
>> You will have to look it up.

11
00:00:31,167 --> 00:00:33,513
>> See what it's all about now that
I'm getting little interviews.

12
00:00:33,513 --> 00:00:40,261
[MUSIC]

13
00:00:40,261 --> 00:00:44,923
>> He was born Cassius Clay, became
Muhammad Ali, and is widely hailed as one

14
00:00:44,923 --> 00:00:49,301
of the greatest and most influential
athletes of the 20th century.

15
00:00:49,301 --> 00:00:53,291
The three time heavyweight champion
possessed unrivaled speed and

16
00:00:53,291 --> 00:00:57,569
agility inside the ring and an unmatched
wit and charisma outside of it.

17
00:00:57,569 --> 00:01:02,034
>> Better thou art to die then
to come down an Uncle Tom and

18
00:01:02,034 --> 00:01:04,894
try making peace just to live a lie!

19
00:01:04,894 --> 00:01:08,649
>> He would come to be celebrated all
over the world, a symbol of tolerance and

20
00:01:08,649 --> 00:01:12,176
understanding, but was militant and
confrontational in his youth.

21
00:01:12,176 --> 00:01:14,661
>> Brother young man, you are brother.

22
00:01:14,661 --> 00:01:17,520
>> His first title bout came from 1964.

23
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:19,904
Few thought he had much of a chance.

24
00:01:19,904 --> 00:01:24,359
>> I predict tonight somebody will die at
ringside from shock!

25
00:01:24,359 --> 00:01:28,218
>> In 1964, the champion was Sonny Liston.

26
00:01:28,218 --> 00:01:30,045
And he was absolutely unbeatable.

27
00:01:30,045 --> 00:01:33,794
Cassius Clay was the seven
to one underdog.

28
00:01:33,794 --> 00:01:38,033
The New York Times sent me down
there with these instructions.

29
00:01:38,033 --> 00:01:41,797
As soon as I got to Miami,
rent a car, drive back and

30
00:01:41,797 --> 00:01:46,352
forth between the arena where
the fight was going to be held and

31
00:01:46,352 --> 00:01:52,679
the nearest hospitals, so I would waste no
time following Cassius Clay into intensive care.

32
00:01:52,679 --> 00:01:55,574
>> Clay dominated the fight
he eluded Liston's fists and

33
00:01:55,574 --> 00:01:59,203
by the sixth round he was hitting
the champion virtually at will.

34
00:01:59,203 --> 00:02:03,772
>> I think that they feel that Clay had
all the confidence he needed to go on and

35
00:02:03,772 --> 00:02:04,812
defeat Sonny.

36
00:02:04,812 --> 00:02:08,276
>> When Liston didn't answer the bell for
the seventh round,

37
00:02:08,276 --> 00:02:11,335
Clay became the Heavy Weight Champion
of the World.

38
00:02:11,335 --> 00:02:15,559
It was clear from the very beginning that
Clay was going to be a different kind of

39
00:02:15,559 --> 00:02:17,356
champion, brash, outspoken.

40
00:02:17,356 --> 00:02:20,630
>> Don't have a mark on my face,
and I upset Sonny Liston, and

41
00:02:20,630 --> 00:02:22,277
I just turned 22 years old.

42
00:02:22,277 --> 00:02:23,877
I must be the greatest.

43
00:02:23,877 --> 00:02:27,237
>> Soon after his victory,
he joined the Nation of Islam and

44
00:02:27,237 --> 00:02:29,272
changed his name to Muhammad Ali.

45
00:02:29,272 --> 00:02:30,202
But many people and

46
00:02:30,202 --> 00:02:34,346
many publications, including The New York
Times, continued to call him Cassius.

47
00:02:34,346 --> 00:02:40,123
>> I said, "Listen, I feel sorry about
this, but this is out of my control."

48
00:02:40,123 --> 00:02:43,817
And he patted me on the head and
said, "Don't worry,

49
00:02:43,817 --> 00:02:49,161
you're just a little brother of
the white power structure." [LAUGH]

50
00:02:49,161 --> 00:02:51,766
>> Some asked if he might
officially change it,

51
00:02:51,766 --> 00:02:56,160
as a reporter did in this press
conference, captured by KTVU news cameras.

52
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:58,840
>> Who would have the face?

53
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:00,201
The judge is what color?

54
00:03:00,201 --> 00:03:01,342
>> I don't know.
>> He's white.

55
00:03:01,342 --> 00:03:01,993
>> Probably.

56
00:03:01,993 --> 00:03:07,891
>> In other words I'd have to ask a white
man may I call myself Mohammad Ali, boss?

57
00:03:07,891 --> 00:03:11,977
>> [LAUGH]
>> He was very sensitive about

58
00:03:11,977 --> 00:03:13,407
my rightful name.

59
00:03:13,407 --> 00:03:19,745
And in several very cool fights, one with
Floyd Patterson, one with Earnie Terrell.

60
00:03:19,745 --> 00:03:25,290
He taunted them, didn't knocked him out
when he could have, because he wanted

61
00:03:25,290 --> 00:03:30,857
to inflict more punishment because they
insisted on calling him Cassius Clay.

62
00:03:30,857 --> 00:03:34,249
>>Floyd dreamed he beat me, he'd apologized.

63
00:03:34,249 --> 00:03:36,753
He'd rather run through hell
with a gasoline smoke coat.

64
00:03:36,753 --> 00:03:38,150
>> He tortured Floyd.

65
00:03:38,150 --> 00:03:42,760
It was like a little boy picking
the wings off a butterfly.

66
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:49,088
And he would just kind of bunch Floyd,
step back.

67
00:03:49,088 --> 00:03:54,570
>> After Patterson, Ali defeated
George Chuvalo in March 1966 and

68
00:03:54,570 --> 00:03:57,981
then Henry Cooper in
a six round TKO in May.

69
00:03:57,981 --> 00:04:00,860
>> He knocked out Brian London
in only three rounds in August.

70
00:04:00,863 --> 00:04:03,671
Beat Carl Millenburger in
12 rounds in September and

71
00:04:03,671 --> 00:04:07,650
defeated Cleveland Waynes in a three
round technical knockout in November

72
00:04:07,650 --> 00:04:12,491
in what many experts consider to be the most
dominant performance in Ali's career.

73
00:04:12,491 --> 00:04:15,797
Four months later in an interview
with Howard Kosell on ABC Sports,

74
00:04:15,797 --> 00:04:17,913
Ali almost came to blows
with Ernie Truell.

75
00:04:17,913 --> 00:04:19,683
>> That's what you are often times!

76
00:04:19,683 --> 00:04:20,791
>> Why you gonna call me?

77
00:04:20,791 --> 00:04:22,488
>> You heard me!

78
00:04:22,488 --> 00:04:24,462
>> Ernie Truell.

79
00:04:24,462 --> 00:04:29,800
Somehow got boxed into standing up for
the establishment.

80
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:32,695
>> Back off of me man.

81
00:04:32,695 --> 00:04:36,012
>> And that was another terrible and
ugly fight.

82
00:04:36,012 --> 00:04:39,447
This was for the mean and cruel streak.

83
00:04:39,447 --> 00:04:42,424
>> Farell would not call him by his name.

84
00:04:42,424 --> 00:04:45,016
He always called him Cassius.

85
00:04:45,016 --> 00:04:46,830
And so, he just punished him.

86
00:04:46,830 --> 00:04:49,197
He was like, what's my name?

87
00:04:49,197 --> 00:04:50,459
>> Said he'll humiliate him.

88
00:04:50,459 --> 00:04:52,017
I hardly think it's necessary.

89
00:04:52,017 --> 00:04:54,321
Don't you agree, Joe?

90
00:04:54,321 --> 00:04:55,942
>> I don't.

91
00:04:55,942 --> 00:04:57,126
I don't know about that.

92
00:04:57,126 --> 00:05:00,223
>> I think Clay can do what
he want to do in the ring.

93
00:05:00,223 --> 00:05:04,518
>> Finally in March 1967,
Ali defeated Zora Folley.

94
00:05:04,518 --> 00:05:07,301
He had won 29 fights in six and
a half years,

95
00:05:07,301 --> 00:05:11,488
one of the most extraordinary runs
in heavyweight boxing history.

96
00:05:11,488 --> 00:05:14,685
Although he didn't know it at the time,
it would be three and

97
00:05:14,685 --> 00:05:16,641
a half years before he fought again.

98
00:05:16,641 --> 00:05:19,374
When Ali refuse induction
into the Armed Forces,

99
00:05:19,374 --> 00:05:23,419
the State Boxing Commission suspended
him and stripped him of his title.

100
00:05:23,419 --> 00:05:28,303
>> The country was pulling apart and
he's caught right in the middle of it.

101
00:05:28,303 --> 00:05:33,290
There's wave after wave of TV reporter,
radio reporter.

102
00:05:33,290 --> 00:05:38,118
They all came, you know in a few minutes
you're gonna be in the front lines.

103
00:05:38,118 --> 00:05:41,467
And then black Muslims would come and
they'd say,

104
00:05:41,467 --> 00:05:46,186
"Some cracker sergeant gonna drop
a hand grenade down into your pants."

105
00:05:46,186 --> 00:05:48,597
He was wild and he was exasperated.

106
00:05:48,597 --> 00:05:50,737
And late in evening,
I remember standing there.

107
00:05:50,737 --> 00:05:56,155
But in the evening, the last radio
reporter comes and he goes, "So champ,

108
00:05:56,155 --> 00:06:00,963
how do you feel about being
reclassified and going to Vietnam?"

109
00:06:00,963 --> 00:06:05,674
And he said, "I ain't got
nothing against them Viet Cong."

110
00:06:05,674 --> 00:06:07,221
The phrase was refined.

111
00:06:07,221 --> 00:06:10,133
"I've got no quarrel
against them Viet Cong.

112
00:06:10,133 --> 00:06:13,059
No Viet Cong ever called me nigger."

113
00:06:13,059 --> 00:06:15,135
He refused to step forward to be drafted.

114
00:06:15,135 --> 00:06:18,646
He was stripped of his title,
but he stood firm.

115
00:06:18,646 --> 00:06:21,602
>> The heavyweight champion of
the world is telling people,

116
00:06:21,602 --> 00:06:25,180
that you can take my belt,
you can take my championship.

117
00:06:25,180 --> 00:06:27,840
And that introduced a lot to courage,

118
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:33,060
to honour, to valor, it's not just
about running fast, jumping high.

119
00:06:33,060 --> 00:06:34,320
But what do you stand for?

120
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:35,260
What are your morals?

121
00:06:35,260 --> 00:06:36,170
What are your principles?

122
00:06:36,170 --> 00:06:37,910
What stand will you take?

123
00:06:37,910 --> 00:06:39,645
What are you willing to risk?

124
00:06:39,645 --> 00:06:42,924
>> So for the next three and
a half years he couldn't fight.

125
00:06:42,924 --> 00:06:48,001
And he had to make a living
mostly by speaking engagements

126
00:06:48,001 --> 00:06:53,198
on college campuses and
in the beginning he was terrible.

127
00:06:53,198 --> 00:06:59,127
>> First of all,
I would like to thank the student

128
00:06:59,127 --> 00:07:04,154
government body for inviting me here.

129
00:07:04,154 --> 00:07:09,314
>> In the course of that, in the Q and
A's after, as they asked him political

130
00:07:09,314 --> 00:07:14,571
questions he would begin to understand
the main threads of American life.

131
00:07:14,571 --> 00:07:16,310
>> You my opposer when I want justice.

132
00:07:16,310 --> 00:07:18,200
You my opposer on inequality.

133
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:21,632
You want me to stand up for and America
for my religious beliefs and you want me

134
00:07:21,632 --> 00:07:25,023
to go somewhere and fight, but you won't
even stand up for me here at home.

135
00:07:25,023 --> 00:07:30,206
And by the end of those three and
a half years, he became a principled man,

136
00:07:30,206 --> 00:07:33,812
and that really became his
importance in America.

137
00:07:33,812 --> 00:07:36,854
>> My conscience won't let
me go shoot some poor,

138
00:07:36,854 --> 00:07:41,830
hungry people in the mud for big powerful
America and shoot them for what?

139
00:07:41,830 --> 00:07:43,440
They never called me nigger.

140
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:44,050
They never lynched me.

141
00:07:44,050 --> 00:07:45,870
They didn't put no dogs on me.

142
00:07:45,870 --> 00:07:48,700
They never robbed me of my nationality.

143
00:07:48,700 --> 00:07:49,915
Shoot them for what?

144
00:07:49,915 --> 00:07:51,215
I'm not gonna shoot them.

145
00:07:51,215 --> 00:07:53,720
Of all the black people no babies and
children, women.

146
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:55,480
How can I shoot them poor people?

147
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:58,754
Just take me to jail.

148
00:07:59,080 --> 00:08:03,140
Ali won his first appeal In 1970 when
a federal court upheld his bid for

149
00:08:03,140 --> 00:08:04,326
a state license.

150
00:08:04,900 --> 00:08:09,406
He quickly got back to work,
beating Jerry Quarry and Oscar Bonavena.

151
00:08:09,460 --> 00:08:12,880
His chance to reclaim his titles
came in March of 1971 against

152
00:08:12,906 --> 00:08:14,940
his old friend Joe Frazier.

153
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:18,120
It was dubbed The Fight of the Century.

154
00:08:18,420 --> 00:08:22,740
>> Today, now 40 years later,
a lot of people, because of their

155
00:08:22,850 --> 00:08:27,970
love of Ali,
think Ali probably won that fight.

156
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Joe Frazier beat him up, and
I can remember him saying

157
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:38,240
when a man gets me going, that's a real
punch, and when he knocks me down,

158
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:44,610
that's a real punch, and
Joe Frazier had knocked him down.

159
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:47,390
And in a way, I'm part of that knock down.

160
00:08:47,390 --> 00:08:52,710
If you look past Ali, you'll see three
gentleman from The New York Times.

161
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:55,440
Arthur Daley, Bob Lipsyte and myself.

162
00:08:55,440 --> 00:09:00,620
And the way you can find me
is I had a pen in my mouth.

163
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:03,860
In the photo, it looks like a mustache.

164
00:09:03,860 --> 00:09:05,940
Trust me, it was a pen.

165
00:09:05,940 --> 00:09:11,661
[NOISE]
>> It was Ali's first professional loss.

166
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:15,376
Even though the decision was undisputed,
he continued to talk trash

167
00:09:15,376 --> 00:09:18,365
about Joe Frazer every chance he got,
wherever he was.

168
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:24,920
[NOISE] Are you Joe Frazier's nephew?

169
00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:27,520
Is he related to you?

170
00:09:27,553 --> 00:09:28,801
>> Yeah.

171
00:09:28,801 --> 00:09:31,799
>> This boy is pretty,
this boy ain't ugly.

172
00:09:31,799 --> 00:09:35,393
>> Ali defeated dethroned
Joe Frazier in January 1974, but

173
00:09:35,393 --> 00:09:39,816
his next championship bout wasn't until
ten months later, when he squared

174
00:09:39,816 --> 00:09:44,400
off against George Forman in a match in
Zaire, dubbed the Rumble in the Jungle.

175
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:49,450
>> Most people, including myself
though Foreman would demolish him.

176
00:09:49,450 --> 00:09:54,300
There were 60,000 people in a soccer
stadium yelling Ali boomaye.

177
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:57,980
What that meant was, Ali kill him.

178
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:00,672
>> Woo, I would give my soul and
my spirit,

179
00:10:00,672 --> 00:10:04,316
100,000 African brothers
yelling Ali boomaye.

180
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:08,056
And I'm a [SOUND]
>> Ali had told them that Foreman was

181
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:10,240
a Belgian.

182
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:11,430
He wasn't of course.

183
00:10:11,430 --> 00:10:15,270
But when they told him that, they wanted
to believe Foreman was the enemy.

184
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:18,440
>> That fight was just masterful.

185
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:20,800
He just blew Foreman's mind.

186
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:26,470
He completely, as much as one competitor
could completely turn someone inside out.

187
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:30,110
Ali had completely turned
Foreman inside out.

188
00:10:30,110 --> 00:10:34,420
>> He backed off into the ropes and
he let Foreman pummel him and

189
00:10:34,420 --> 00:10:38,280
Foreman just smashed his ribs and
everything.

190
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:42,150
And finally,
Foreman just kinda punched himself out.

191
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:47,340
And Ali threw a right hand in
the 8th round I looked up and

192
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:53,250
Foreman spun and went down and
just had no energy to get up.

193
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:56,966
It was three years after
he had lost to Frazier, and

194
00:10:56,966 --> 00:10:59,547
now suddenly everybody loved him.

195
00:10:59,547 --> 00:11:05,279
That's sports,
that's the way it works sometimes.

196
00:11:07,280 --> 00:11:11,359
>> [NOISE]
>> Only few months later,

197
00:11:11,359 --> 00:11:12,680
he found himself abroad again.

198
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:16,182
This time in Malaysia,
to defend his title against Joe Bugner.

199
00:11:16,182 --> 00:11:20,742
>> They had never had a heavy weight
title fight in Kuala Lumpur and they were

200
00:11:20,742 --> 00:11:25,693
making a big thing out of everything,
including the selection of the gloves.

201
00:11:25,693 --> 00:11:29,231
They brought them in on a pillow,
each fighter tried on his gloves and

202
00:11:29,231 --> 00:11:29,966
everything.

203
00:11:29,966 --> 00:11:34,523
And then after [LAUGH] all the selection,

204
00:11:34,523 --> 00:11:38,147
they put them back in the boxes.

205
00:11:38,147 --> 00:11:39,950
And then they sealed it.

206
00:11:39,950 --> 00:11:42,806
They sealed the boxes
with wax from a candle.

207
00:11:42,806 --> 00:11:48,276
And they literally were going to put
them in a safe inside a jail cell and

208
00:11:48,276 --> 00:11:51,956
padlock the cell so
nobody could tamper with the gloves.

209
00:11:51,956 --> 00:11:55,464
And Ali said, "The gloves are going to jail?

210
00:11:55,520 --> 00:11:58,400
The gloves are going to jail?

211
00:11:58,400 --> 00:12:02,080
The gloves ain't done nothing—yet."

212
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:05,339
>> Muhammad Ali was fun to be around.

213
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:07,442
He was entertainment, he was a pleaser.

214
00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:13,600
I remember once he had done an exhibition
in Florida on a field on a makeshift rink.

215
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:19,520
His dressing room was
a recreational vehicle.

216
00:12:19,520 --> 00:12:24,059
After his exhibition he went back to

217
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:30,025
the recreational vehicle and
shooed everybody out.

218
00:12:30,025 --> 00:12:35,226
Looked around the crowd picked
out three cute young women,

219
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:40,086
brought them in,
sent two of them out, door closed and

220
00:12:40,086 --> 00:12:44,840
the rec vehicle began
to shake back and forth.

221
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:49,300
The trainer, the PR guy, his masseuse,

222
00:12:49,300 --> 00:12:53,970
everybody said no, this is off the record.

223
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:57,290
Don't ever write about it because
you'll never talk to him again.

224
00:12:57,290 --> 00:13:01,010
But I figured,
he has hundreds of people

225
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:04,200
in these fields standing
around who had seen this.

226
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:05,680
This is a public event.

227
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:09,000
How could you not write about it?

228
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,940
So, that's how ended
The New York Times magazine piece.

229
00:13:13,790 --> 00:13:19,790
And the editors put the headline on it,
King of All Kings, because

230
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:23,800
he had refered to himself somewhere
along the way as King of All Kings.

231
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:25,766
So now it's six months later and

232
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:30,740
they send me down to the movie set of
The Greatest, his faux autobiography.

233
00:13:32,086 --> 00:13:37,420
The moment I got there I heard,
"Bob!" and he came running over and

234
00:13:37,420 --> 00:13:41,580
he grabbed me and said,
"King of all kings, you got that right!"

235
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:44,150
He did have this grandiosity about him.

236
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:46,330
And he was a narcissist.

237
00:13:46,330 --> 00:13:50,350
And I think there were some dark
parts of him which [you] can't avoid.

238
00:13:50,350 --> 00:13:55,930
Perhaps the darkest was a kind
of vicious attack on Joe Frazier.

239
00:13:55,930 --> 00:13:57,930
Calling him an Uncle Tom.

240
00:13:57,930 --> 00:13:59,520
Calling him a gorilla.

241
00:14:00,250 --> 00:14:02,750
"I will beat the gorilla in
the Thrilla in Manilla."

242
00:14:02,750 --> 00:14:06,380
And later on ascribing all of
this to a kind of beating the drum

243
00:14:06,410 --> 00:14:08,070
for the box office.

244
00:14:08,070 --> 00:14:09,680
Well somehow that's even worse.

245
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:10,720
>> He's Uncle Tom.

246
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:12,200
>> Why do you say that?

247
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:13,200
>> Just don't call him Clay.

248
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:16,180
Call him Uncle Tom.

249
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:18,460
>> Frazier supported
Ali's stance on Vietnam.

250
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:21,227
He even lent him money
when Ali wasn't fighting.

251
00:14:21,227 --> 00:14:24,347
But what started as a friendly rivalry
in the ring became something altogether

252
00:14:24,347 --> 00:14:25,767
different.

253
00:14:25,767 --> 00:14:29,727
Frasier was hurt and angry when they faced
off for the third time in the Philippines.

254
00:14:29,727 --> 00:14:32,959
>> God, it had to be a hundred
degrees in that arena.

255
00:14:34,220 --> 00:14:37,160
And it was a brutal fight, brutal.

256
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:39,720
I mean, I'd call it an epic
in brutality and it was.

257
00:14:40,100 --> 00:14:41,940
I mean you couldn't,

258
00:14:41,940 --> 00:14:44,210
It was never a slow movement.

259
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:46,150
I mean the punches were brutal.

260
00:14:46,150 --> 00:14:52,107
And also, by that time four years
after the first fight in the Garden.

261
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:55,293
They were older and slower.

262
00:14:55,300 --> 00:14:57,770
They really couldn't get
out of each other's way.

263
00:14:57,770 --> 00:14:58,960
So every punch landed.

264
00:15:00,350 --> 00:15:04,250
It was stopped in the 15th
round by Joe Frazier's trainer.

265
00:15:04,250 --> 00:15:05,990
Because his left eye had been closing.

266
00:15:05,990 --> 00:15:09,090
He couldn't see Ali's
right hand punches coming.

267
00:15:09,090 --> 00:15:10,438
So he stopped it.

268
00:15:10,438 --> 00:15:13,846
Even though he thought Frazier was ahead, he stopped the fight because he didn't

269
00:15:15,872 --> 00:15:16,814
want Joe to get hurt.

270
00:15:16,814 --> 00:15:21,576
One of the first questions,
if not the first,

271
00:15:21,576 --> 00:15:26,838
someone said to him,
what was it like in that ring?

272
00:15:26,838 --> 00:15:31,340
I'll never forget, all Ali said
was, "It was next to death."

273
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:40,110
>> Frazier lost to Forman again and
then retired.

274
00:15:40,110 --> 00:15:44,761
Ali fought ten more times,
defeating Coopman, Young,

275
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:48,329
Dunn, Norton, Evangelista, Shavers.

276
00:15:48,329 --> 00:15:52,999
He lost his title to Leon Spinks in 1978,
won it back later that year and

277
00:15:52,999 --> 00:15:56,321
lost it for
the last time to Larry Holmes in 1980.

278
00:15:56,321 --> 00:15:59,100
>> Larry, I'd like you to
explain why you've been crying.

279
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:01,110
>> You know I really
respect Ali a whole lot.

280
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:04,930
>> It hurt you to punish
him that way, didn't it?

281
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:07,120
>> But still Ali fought on.

282
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:09,830
He finally retired after losing
to Trevor Berbick a little

283
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:12,720
over a month before his 40th birthday.

284
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:14,846
Two years later,

285
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:18,404
Dave Anderson caught up with him
before Ali left on a goodwill tour.

286
00:16:18,404 --> 00:16:20,540
>> He was probably a few pounds heavy.

287
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:22,970
So he was going through some training.

288
00:16:22,970 --> 00:16:25,920
He just liked training, but
something to get the weight off.

289
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:30,660
That was the first time I noticed
that he was slurring his words.

290
00:16:30,660 --> 00:16:34,070
and as we all know that got worse and
worse and worse and worse.

291
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:39,920
I mean its been a terrible,
terrible scene for years with Muhammad.

292
00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:45,830
>> Ali's decline was as rapid as it was
dramatic. He appeared in public less and

293
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:48,190
less frequently as time went on, but

294
00:16:48,190 --> 00:16:51,770
despite his obvious difficulty
days he never lost his spark.

295
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:58,460
>> I think he's an enormously
interesting character.

296
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:03,150
I think that he may have been
the greatest fighter we've ever seen.

297
00:17:03,150 --> 00:17:08,970
I think that he's an amazing
window on a historical period.

298
00:17:10,079 --> 00:17:15,519
As a human being that I knew and
travelled with, I loved him.

299
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:18,502
There were things about him I hated, but

300
00:17:18,502 --> 00:17:21,909
I loved him as a human being and
he was pure fun.

301
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:25,294
[MUSIC]

302
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:30,135
>> I saw him at the olympics at Sydney
Australia and by this time the Parkinson's

303
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:33,420
had begun to ravish him
>> But I remember meeting

304
00:17:36,570 --> 00:17:40,532
him at some little event and
there was again just a small gathering.

305
00:17:40,532 --> 00:17:46,160
And so, I introduced myself,
reintroduced myself to him and

306
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:50,150
I said, he said, by this time he
started he said, what's your name?

307
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:51,680
And so, I said my name is Bill Rhoades.

308
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:53,360
No, no, no.

309
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:55,600
What's your real name?

310
00:17:55,625 --> 00:17:57,145
>> I never told you my real
name was Cassius Clay.

311
00:17:57,145 --> 00:17:59,304
My name is Muhammad Ali, and

312
00:17:59,304 --> 00:18:03,837
you will announce it right there
in the center of that lane!

313
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:06,957
You must listen to me!

314
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:08,283
I am the king of the world!

315
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:10,400
>> Hold it!
Hold it!

316
00:18:10,419 --> 00:18:11,582
Hold it!
Hold it!

317
00:18:11,582 --> 00:18:12,189
You're not that privileged.

318
00:18:12,189 --> 00:18:14,046
>> That's my best man.

319
00:18:14,046 --> 00:18:15,742
I'm king of the world!

320
00:18:15,742 --> 00:18:16,734
I'm king of the world!

321
00:18:16,734 --> 00:18:19,241
>> King of the world!
