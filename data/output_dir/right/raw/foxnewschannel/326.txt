1
00:00:07,408 --> 00:00:09,342
IN ALL OF THE CHAOS REGARDING

2
00:00:09,343 --> 00:00:13,146
DENOMINATION OF JUDGE BRETT

3
00:00:13,147 --> 00:00:13,880
KAVANAUGH, WE SHOULD REMEMBER

4
00:00:13,881 --> 00:00:16,349
ONE FACT, IF HE WAS PRO-CHOICE

5
00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:17,984
HE WOULD'VE BEEN CONFIRMED

6
00:00:17,985 --> 00:00:20,453
WITH 100 VOTE.

7
00:00:20,454 --> 00:00:21,321
HE'S NOT AN ADVOCATE FOR

8
00:00:21,322 --> 00:00:22,021
ABORTION BUT DEMOCRATS DIDN'T

9
00:00:22,022 --> 00:00:26,059
HAVE THE VOTES TO STOP HIM.

10
00:00:26,060 --> 00:00:26,826
SO INSTEAD THEY DECIDED TO

11
00:00:26,827 --> 00:00:28,561
SLANDER HIM AS A GANG RAPIST.

12
00:00:28,562 --> 00:00:29,596
DEMOCRATIC OPPOSITION STARTED

13
00:00:29,597 --> 00:00:33,600
NOT WITH HIS TEAM FORD BUT

14
00:00:33,601 --> 00:00:35,335
WITH WOMEN IN HANDMADE TALE

15
00:00:35,336 --> 00:00:37,503
OUTFIT OCCUPYING THE HEARING

16
00:00:37,504 --> 00:00:37,837

17
00:00:37,838 --> 00:00:39,138
AND PRO- ABORTION PROTESTERS

18
00:00:39,139 --> 00:00:42,942
BEING DRAGGED OUT OF THE

00:00:42,943 --> 00:00:45,712

23
00:00:45,813 --> 00:00:46,079
HEARING.

24
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:46,779
IT'S NOT A SHOCK THAT PLANNED

25
00:00:46,780 --> 00:00:47,480
PARENTHOOD, THE ORGANIZATION

26
00:00:47,481 --> 00:00:48,181
RESPONSIBLE FOR HUNDREDS OF

27
00:00:48,182 --> 00:00:50,884
THOUSANDS ABORTIONS.

28
00:00:50,885 --> 00:00:51,885
YEAR OPENLY THREATENED

29
00:00:51,886 --> 00:00:52,552
SENATORS IN POETRY SAYING

30
00:00:52,553 --> 00:00:54,287
ROSES ARE RED, VIOLETS ARE

31
00:00:54,288 --> 00:00:56,022
BLUE, SENATORS VOTE NO ON

32
00:00:56,023 --> 00:00:59,158
KAVANAUGH OR WE ARE COMING FOR

33
00:00:59,159 --> 00:01:01,794
YOU.

34
00:01:01,795 --> 00:01:02,328
NOW THAT'S ROMANCE.

35
00:01:02,329 --> 00:01:04,597
ABORTION THE VAST MAJORITY OF

36
00:01:04,598 --> 00:01:15,408
THE LEFT IS NOT MERELY UP

37
00:01:15,409 --> 00:01:16,175
CLINICAL ISSUE BUT IT'S A

38
00:01:16,176 --> 00:01:16,809
DEFINING CHARACTER ISSUE.

39
00:01:16,810 --> 00:01:17,510
IF YOU'RE PRO- ABORTION YOU

40
00:01:17,511 --> 00:01:18,211
ARE A GOOD, GENEROUS, DECENT

41
00:01:18,212 --> 00:01:18,811
PERSON WHO VALUES WOMEN.

42
00:01:18,812 --> 00:01:20,580
IF YOU'RE PRO-LIFE YOU ARE AN

43
00:01:20,581 --> 00:01:21,214
EVIL, REPRESSIVE NATURAL

44
00:01:21,215 --> 00:01:21,881
PERSON WHO WANTS TO CONTROL

45
00:01:21,882 --> 00:01:22,315
WOMEN'S BODY.

46
00:01:22,316 --> 00:01:23,416
IT'S THAT VIEW THAT LEADS TO

47
00:01:23,417 --> 00:01:32,292
THESE IN WHICH A PRO-LIFE

48
00:01:32,293 --> 00:01:32,959
ADVOCATE WAS KICKED IN THE

49
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:33,660
FACE BY A PRO- ABORTION

50
00:01:33,661 --> 00:01:34,060
NUTCASE.

51
00:01:34,061 --> 00:01:34,527
>> IT'S A BABY.

52
00:01:34,528 --> 00:01:35,194
IF SOMEONE WAS RAPED AND SHE

53
00:01:35,195 --> 00:01:35,895
GAVE BIRTH AND SHE DECIDED TO

54
00:01:35,896 --> 00:01:38,231
KILL HER 3-YEAR-OLD CHILD.

55
00:01:38,232 --> 00:01:39,933
>> THE PRO- ABORTION MOVEMENT

56
00:01:39,934 --> 00:01:42,969
SUGGESTS PRO-LIFERS ARE

57
00:01:42,970 --> 00:01:43,303
EXTREME.

58
00:01:43,304 --> 00:01:45,338
IN REALITY THE EXTREME

59
00:01:45,339 --> 00:01:46,105
POSITION IS HELD BY THE

60
00:01:46,106 --> 00:01:46,606
DEMOCRATIC PARTY.

61
00:01:46,607 --> 00:01:48,374
THEIR PLATFORM CALLS FOR LEGAL

62
00:01:48,375 --> 00:01:49,142
ABORTION ALL THE WAY UNTIL

63
00:01:49,143 --> 00:01:54,180
POINT OF BIRTH BUT PROBE

64
00:01:54,181 --> 00:01:54,881
ABORTION EXTREMISTS GET AWAY

65
00:01:54,882 --> 00:01:55,615
WITH THE RHETORIC BECAUSE THEY

66
00:01:55,616 --> 00:01:56,316
USE EUPHEMISTIC LANGUAGE TO

67
00:01:56,317 --> 00:01:59,085
DESCRIBE WHAT IT IS.

68
00:01:59,086 --> 00:02:02,922
THE WORD ABORTION IS A YOU CAN

69
00:02:02,923 --> 00:02:03,289
EUPHEMISM.

70
00:02:03,290 --> 00:02:10,763
IT'S A POLYP REMOVAL ACCORDING

71
00:02:10,764 --> 00:02:11,097
TO THEM.

72
00:02:11,098 --> 00:02:11,831
THEY IGNORE ADVOCATES TO AVOID

73
00:02:11,832 --> 00:02:14,968
LOOKING REALITY IN THE FACE.

74
00:02:14,969 --> 00:02:15,902
FROM JUST A FEW MOMENTS, LET'S

75
00:02:15,903 --> 00:02:17,370
LOOK REALITY IN THE FACE.

76
00:02:17,371 --> 00:02:18,972
THIS IS A PICTURE OF A 19 WEEK

77
00:02:18,973 --> 00:02:20,573
OLD BABY.

78
00:02:20,574 --> 00:02:21,274
THIS IS A HUMAN CHILD.

79
00:02:21,275 --> 00:02:28,181
THIS IS NOT A BALL OF GOO OR A

80
00:02:28,182 --> 00:02:28,681
CLUSTER OF CELLS.

81
00:02:28,682 --> 00:02:29,382
IN JANUARY, 44 DEMOCRATS IN

82
00:02:29,383 --> 00:02:30,149
THE UNITED STATES SENATE VOTED

83
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:30,950
NOT TO PROTECT THE RIGHTS OF

84
00:02:30,951 --> 00:02:31,985
BABIES OLDER THAN THIS UNBORN

85
00:02:31,986 --> 00:02:32,285
CHILD.

86
00:02:32,286 --> 00:02:35,555
ONLY THREE DEMOCRATS JOE

87
00:02:35,556 --> 00:02:36,489
MANSION AND BOB CASEY VOTED TO

88
00:02:36,490 --> 00:02:38,358
PROTECT CHILDREN AT 20 WEEKS.

89
00:02:38,359 --> 00:02:38,992
ONLY TWO REPUBLICANS VOTED

90
00:02:38,993 --> 00:02:42,528
AGAINST SUCH PROTECTION.

91
00:02:42,529 --> 00:02:43,963
TAKE A GOOD LOOK AT THAT

92
00:02:43,964 --> 00:02:44,263
BABY.

93
00:02:44,264 --> 00:02:47,300
THAT IS A HUMAN BEING WITH

94
00:02:47,301 --> 00:02:48,534
ZERO RIGHTS ACCORDING TO THE

95
00:02:48,535 --> 00:02:49,836
MAINSTREAM OF THE DEMOCRATIC

96
00:02:49,837 --> 00:02:53,373
PARTY.

97
00:02:53,374 --> 00:02:54,240
HUMAN LIFE DOESN'T BEGIN AT 20

98
00:02:54,241 --> 00:02:54,540
WEEKS.

99
00:02:54,541 --> 00:02:56,275
THIS IS A PICTURE OF A BABY AT

100
00:02:56,276 --> 00:02:56,876
12 WEEKS, BARELY THREE

101
00:02:56,877 --> 00:02:57,210
MONTHS.

102
00:02:57,211 --> 00:02:58,511
YOU CAN SEE THIS BABY WITH HIS

103
00:02:58,512 --> 00:03:02,015
HANDS NEAR HIS CHEST.

104
00:03:02,016 --> 00:03:02,915
THIS IS NOT A CLUSTER OF

105
00:03:02,916 --> 00:03:05,385
CELLS, THIS IS NOT A BALL OF

106
00:03:05,386 --> 00:03:05,651
GOO.

107
00:03:05,652 --> 00:03:06,285
HIS GENITALIA HAVE BEEN

108
00:03:06,286 --> 00:03:09,489
FORMED, HIS LIVER ENDS CLEAN

109
00:03:09,490 --> 00:03:10,256
PRODUCE RED BLOOD CELLS, THIS

110
00:03:10,257 --> 00:03:12,825
IS AN UNBORN HUMAN BEING.

111
00:03:12,826 --> 00:03:13,626
NOT A SINGLE FEDERALLY ELECTED

112
00:03:13,627 --> 00:03:14,961
DEMOCRAT WOULD VOTE FOR AN

113
00:03:14,962 --> 00:03:15,561
ABORTION BAN THAT WOULD

114
00:03:15,562 --> 00:03:17,530
PROTECT THIS BABY'S LIFE.

115
00:03:17,531 --> 00:03:18,965
LIFE DOESN'T BEGIN AT 14

116
00:03:18,966 --> 00:03:22,602
WEEKS.

117
00:03:22,603 --> 00:03:23,703
THIS IS A PICTURE OF AN UNBORN

118
00:03:23,704 --> 00:03:24,404
HUMAN BEING AT EIGHT WEEKS.

119
00:03:24,405 --> 00:03:25,271
YOU CAN IDENTIFY THE HEAD OF

120
00:03:25,272 --> 00:03:26,205
THIS UNBORN HUMAN, YOU CAN SEE

121
00:03:26,206 --> 00:03:30,943
WHERE THE SMALL BUDS ARE

122
00:03:30,944 --> 00:03:32,211
FORMING FOR ARMS AND LEGS, BUT

123
00:03:32,212 --> 00:03:32,979
GUESS WHAT, LIFE DOESN'T BEGIN

124
00:03:32,980 --> 00:03:33,546
AT EIGHT WEEKS EITHER.

125
00:03:33,547 --> 00:03:34,213
IT BEGINS AT FERTILIZATION

126
00:03:34,214 --> 00:03:34,914
WHEN A NEW HUMAN LIFE IS

127
00:03:34,915 --> 00:03:35,214
BORN.

128
00:03:35,215 --> 00:03:37,950
A NEW HUMAN BEING WITH ITS OWN

129
00:03:37,951 --> 00:03:39,018
DNA, A HUMAN BEING IS NOT ITS

130
00:03:39,019 --> 00:03:43,189
MOTHER OR FATHER, IT'S NOT A

131
00:03:43,190 --> 00:03:44,490
POLYP, IF WE FOUND A HUMAN

132
00:03:44,491 --> 00:03:48,995
EMBRYO ON ANOTHER PLANET THE

133
00:03:48,996 --> 00:03:49,695
HEADLINES WOULD SCREAM HUMAN

134
00:03:49,696 --> 00:03:50,229
LIFE FOUND ON MARS.

135
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:53,266
THE CONTINUOUS PROCESSING

136
00:03:53,267 --> 00:03:53,766
GROWTH

137
00:03:53,767 --> 00:03:53,800
GOWTH

138
00:03:53,801 --> 00:03:53,833
GROTH

139
00:03:53,834 --> 00:03:54,100
GROWTH.

140
00:03:54,101 --> 00:03:54,767
ABORTION IS THE KILLING OF

141
00:03:54,768 --> 00:03:55,234
THIS HUMAN LIFE.

142
00:03:55,235 --> 00:03:59,972
LATER THE ABORTION TAKES

143
00:03:59,973 --> 00:04:00,640
PLACE, THE MORE BRUTAL THE

144
00:04:00,641 --> 00:04:01,007
PROCEDURE.

145
00:04:01,008 --> 00:04:01,774
NO MATTER THE BRUTALITY, IT IS

146
00:04:01,775 --> 00:04:02,508
OBVIOUS THAT ABORTION IS NOT

147
00:04:02,509 --> 00:04:05,711
SOME MERE OPTIONAL SURGERY TO

148
00:04:05,712 --> 00:04:07,313
BE FOR PERFORMED FOR

149
00:04:07,314 --> 00:04:08,081
CONVENIENCE AND IT'S EVEN MORE

150
00:04:08,082 --> 00:04:09,015
OBVIOUS THAT THOSE WHO WANT TO

151
00:04:09,016 --> 00:04:09,782
PROTECT THE LIVES OF THE

152
00:04:09,783 --> 00:04:10,883
UNBORN AREN'T TRYING TO

153
00:04:10,884 --> 00:04:11,584
CONTROL WOMEN'S BODIES.

154
00:04:11,585 --> 00:04:13,352
THOSE WHO CHERISH ABORTION ARE

155
00:04:13,353 --> 00:04:14,087
TRYING TO CONTROL AND

156
00:04:14,088 --> 00:04:16,656
DISMEMBER THE BODIES OF THE

157
00:04:16,656 --> 00:04:16,988
UNBORN.

158
00:04:16,990 --> 00:04:17,757
THINK ABOUT THAT NEXT TIME YOU

159
00:04:17,757 --> 00:04:18,957
SEE A RADICAL FEMINIST IN A

00:04:18,959 --> 00:00:00,000
HANDMADE TALE OUTFIT
