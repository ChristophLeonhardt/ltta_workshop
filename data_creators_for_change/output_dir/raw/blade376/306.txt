but where do I start or do I talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font>

16
00:00:53,379 --> 00:00:55,329
<font color="#E5E5E5">as good and bad things on the talk about</font>

17
00:00:55,329 --> 00:01:00,690
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> this you know one it manager guess a</font>

18
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:06,700
lot of people<font color="#CCCCCC"> when</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the big comments are</font>

19
00:01:06,700 --> 00:01:08,259
get especially when<font color="#CCCCCC"> I you know where I</font>

20
00:01:08,259 --> 00:01:10,630
am out<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the real world not miss radius</font>

21
00:01:10,630 --> 00:01:12,970
on<font color="#E5E5E5"> YouTube is or on stickam it's a</font>

22
00:01:12,970 --> 00:01:16,210
matter if by the serious face respite

23
00:01:16,210 --> 00:01:20,200
second<font color="#E5E5E5"> people is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> go miles smile and it's</font>

24
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:22,210
like it I always<font color="#CCCCCC"> say the same thing</font>

25
00:01:22,210 --> 00:01:23,920
they'll do you know how hard it<font color="#E5E5E5"> is to</font>

26
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:26,800
smoke constantly get cheekbones really

27
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:29,140
hurt but the reason they say that is

28
00:01:29,140 --> 00:01:32,770
because for some reason I'm someone now

29
00:01:32,770 --> 00:01:37,360
who is very rarely seen down feeling low

30
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:41,920
depressed I'm always happy nothing ever

31
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:48,130
seems to annoy me<font color="#CCCCCC"> Wow there is a lot got</font>

32
00:01:48,130 --> 00:01:54,570
to say actually and yeah it's because

33
00:01:54,570 --> 00:01:57,939
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's a big change from what my life used</font>

34
00:01:57,939 --> 00:02:01,829
to be I'm movin to go into<font color="#E5E5E5"> it completely</font>

35
00:02:01,829 --> 00:02:05,799
but<font color="#CCCCCC"> less for this way when I was in</font>

36
00:02:05,799 --> 00:02:10,410
primary school<font color="#E5E5E5"> and when I was in college</font>

37
00:02:10,410 --> 00:02:12,880
secretary school high school whatever

38
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:16,030
you want to call it I was<font color="#E5E5E5"> sewing who I</font>

39
00:02:16,030 --> 00:02:18,570
was an outcast

40
00:02:19,370 --> 00:02:22,159
when is your typical story I had a group

41
00:02:22,159 --> 00:02:24,830
of friends<font color="#CCCCCC"> always respected but I'm</font>

42
00:02:24,830 --> 00:02:26,209
someone who never hangs around with

43
00:02:26,209 --> 00:02:28,370
particular group people I do at times

44
00:02:28,370 --> 00:02:30,769
but I hang around with a you know people

45
00:02:30,769 --> 00:02:33,019
<font color="#CCCCCC">from every every lays different groups</font>

46
00:02:33,019 --> 00:02:34,220
you know I try<font color="#E5E5E5"> and hang out with</font>

47
00:02:34,220 --> 00:02:38,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">everyone but I was never signed it was</font>

48
00:02:38,150 --> 00:02:40,579
really like that popular at school in

49
00:02:40,579 --> 00:02:43,159
that and I was seen as quite a bit of a

50
00:02:43,159 --> 00:02:47,769
joke like many and I worked in<font color="#E5E5E5"> France</font>

51
00:02:47,769 --> 00:02:56,480
from november to april 2014 no 2005-2006

52
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:59,690
and when I was up there it drove me

53
00:02:59,690 --> 00:03:01,940
insane I was isolated<font color="#E5E5E5"> up this mountain</font>

54
00:03:01,940 --> 00:03:05,780
and when I was there my sanity was

55
00:03:05,780 --> 00:03:08,060
really cracking and I got frustrated I

56
00:03:08,060 --> 00:03:10,579
was a pushover people wound me up and I

57
00:03:10,579 --> 00:03:13,790
gave a reaction now I've<font color="#CCCCCC"> just grown out</font>

58
00:03:13,790 --> 00:03:15,709
of it and you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm a strong person</font>

59
00:03:15,709 --> 00:03:18,560
but people think that means I can't be

60
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:20,450
unhappy people think it means i'm happy

61
00:03:20,450 --> 00:03:22,190
with time and it's an expectation they

62
00:03:22,190 --> 00:03:25,880
have and today I'm feeling<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

63
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:29,269
unhappy now<font color="#E5E5E5"> i just thought i'd share and</font>

64
00:03:29,269 --> 00:03:30,829
this good probably a long blog so i

65
00:03:30,829 --> 00:03:32,720
think i need people read truly do care

66
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:34,819
about you know me as a person space to

67
00:03:34,819 --> 00:03:37,970
<font color="#CCCCCC">the videos i create for people</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> who have</font>

68
00:03:37,970 --> 00:03:44,980
too much time on<font color="#CCCCCC"> their hands well</font>

69
00:03:44,980 --> 00:03:47,120
firstly I want to say is a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of people</font>

70
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:51,739
<font color="#E5E5E5">say miles cheer up it's a phase etc and</font>

71
00:03:51,739 --> 00:03:54,079
what I say to that is of course it is

72
00:03:54,079 --> 00:03:55,519
and whenever I make a video where I'm

73
00:03:55,519 --> 00:03:58,129
feeling like people think that you know

74
00:03:58,129 --> 00:03:59,989
they're telling me you know i'll go over

75
00:03:59,989 --> 00:04:02,090
it well firstly i always normally get

76
00:04:02,090 --> 00:04:04,220
over this but the reason I talk when I

77
00:04:04,220 --> 00:04:05,629
am feeling low is it's a good way of

78
00:04:05,629 --> 00:04:08,660
getting<font color="#CCCCCC"> out</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of it I'm always an optimist</font>

79
00:04:08,660 --> 00:04:14,660
an optimist yeah that's right quite<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

80
00:04:14,660 --> 00:04:16,160
lot my dad actually and whenever there's

81
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:17,930
really bad stuff there's always<font color="#CCCCCC"> a way</font>

82
00:04:17,930 --> 00:04:19,789
<font color="#E5E5E5">getting out</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it and you know I'll get</font>

83
00:04:19,789 --> 00:04:22,550
all this oh this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the song I used for</font>

86
00:04:34,180 --> 00:04:36,610

87
00:04:36,610 --> 00:04:41,380

88
00:04:41,380 --> 00:04:43,300

I'm not gonna mention a name I'll

113
00:05:48,370 --> 00:05:49,900
brilliant a messager so she sees this

114
00:05:49,900 --> 00:05:52,870
because I wanted to<font color="#CCCCCC"> know that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this is</font>

115
00:05:52,870 --> 00:05:55,210
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> perspective of God because</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> she now</font>

my person I which was<font color="#E5E5E5"> slightly bitter</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">to I'm not perfect I've got many</font>

123
00:06:11,710 --> 00:06:14,940

relationship was friends or whatever if

125
00:06:17,650 --> 00:06:20,290
Sykes not going right and I feel out of

126
00:06:20,290 --> 00:06:22,210
control and I feel<font color="#CCCCCC"> like it's not getting</font>

127
00:06:22,210 --> 00:06:23,710
better and I don't know what to<font color="#CCCCCC"> do I'll</font>

128
00:06:23,710 --> 00:06:25,930
get bitter about it on a<font color="#CCCCCC"> relationship</font>

129
00:06:25,930 --> 00:06:27,370
level if those ago that i really liked

130
00:06:27,370 --> 00:06:29,500
and she doesn't want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be with me I</font>

131
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:31,600
can't be a friend and I've spoken about

132
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:33,760
this before it has to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be you know I look</font>

133
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:35,800
at her and I always<font color="#E5E5E5"> want there to be</font>

134
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:40,510
more than<font color="#CCCCCC"> just friends you know and with</font>

135
00:06:40,510 --> 00:06:42,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">his</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> place on youtube I Chad were quite a</font>

lot but she's got big now I'm not<font color="#CCCCCC"> even</font>

137
00:06:47,050 --> 00:06:48,700
<font color="#CCCCCC">saying this is the reason why she's not</font>

138
00:06:48,700 --> 00:06:50,800
<font color="#CCCCCC">chance me anymore I don't know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> but the</font>

139
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:52,300
truth is I've tried to make an effort

140
00:06:52,300 --> 00:06:56,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">show over lots and lots and although</font>

141
00:06:56,950 --> 00:06:58,480
it's just a friend she's on a respect

142
00:06:58,480 --> 00:06:59,560
and that's what makes it more painful

143
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:01,600
for<font color="#CCCCCC"> me is one of respects on and they're</font>

144
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:04,060
not even replying<font color="#CCCCCC"> just they are too busy</font>

145
00:07:04,060 --> 00:07:05,770
to chat but then I see on stickam and

146
00:07:05,770 --> 00:07:07,960
chat and messing around with guys in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

147
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:09,850
chat room it's like working you to be

148
00:07:09,850 --> 00:07:11,260
<font color="#CCCCCC">honest or if there was st. wrong just</font>

149
00:07:11,260 --> 00:07:12,520

150
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:14,140
that I've<font color="#E5E5E5"> made a mistake we can either</font>

151
00:07:14,140 --> 00:07:16,390
move on from there I'll stay out of your

152
00:07:16,390 --> 00:07:21,090
way but then I reponse things I guess

153
00:07:21,909 --> 00:07:25,120
it's tough

154
00:07:28,409 --> 00:07:31,800
so another thing that I've been told by

155
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:36,569
people well by one person who I know in

156
00:07:36,569 --> 00:07:43,489
real life she says too heavy<font color="#CCCCCC"> too heavy</font>

157
00:07:43,489 --> 00:07:48,269
this is nice I'm told that I take myself

158
00:07:48,269 --> 00:07:50,219
too seriously and this is an interesting

159
00:07:50,219 --> 00:07:52,649
thing I know when I look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at my videos I</font>

160
00:07:52,649 --> 00:07:54,659
know there<font color="#CCCCCC"> are times</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> where I do take</font>

161
00:07:54,659 --> 00:07:56,369
myself sit<font color="#E5E5E5"> well I'm not taking honest</font>

162
00:07:56,369 --> 00:07:58,259
I'm taking a serious approach but for me

163
00:07:58,259 --> 00:08:00,389
I might always taking myself seriously

164
00:08:00,389 --> 00:08:02,969
do I actually take myself seriously when

165
00:08:02,969 --> 00:08:05,099
I'm serious on camera is at me taking

166
00:08:05,099 --> 00:08:07,589
myself well I don't know<font color="#E5E5E5"> it depends what</font>

167
00:08:07,589 --> 00:08:09,029
she means by that but for<font color="#E5E5E5"> me it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> means</font>

168
00:08:09,029 --> 00:08:11,669
that I'm not I don't lighten up I'm

169
00:08:11,669 --> 00:08:14,009
always too serious i'm depressed either

170
00:08:14,009 --> 00:08:15,629
come our videos<font color="#E5E5E5"> i mean i'm interested</font>

171
00:08:15,629 --> 00:08:16,769
for everyone to make your own<font color="#E5E5E5"> judgment</font>

172
00:08:16,769 --> 00:08:19,439
for me<font color="#E5E5E5"> i have a balance sometimes i do</font>

173
00:08:19,439 --> 00:08:21,629
really serious vlog sometimes I really

174
00:08:21,629 --> 00:08:23,759
Jacob<font color="#CCCCCC"> mugs I've got a spectrum of two</font>

175
00:08:23,759 --> 00:08:25,769
extremes and maybe that's why it shows

176
00:08:25,769 --> 00:08:28,800
up so much more a video like this i'll

177
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:31,139
be taking self so seriously but I think

178
00:08:31,139 --> 00:08:32,669
maybe for some people it's a shock that

179
00:08:32,669 --> 00:08:35,039
people you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know me in person to see me</font>

180
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:37,500
expose myself like this an interesting

181
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:41,969
thing is like<font color="#E5E5E5"> I was walking outside few</font>

182
00:08:41,969 --> 00:08:43,289
minutes ago just thinking about stuff in

183
00:08:43,289 --> 00:08:44,730
there and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I was</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going to sit just</font>

184
00:08:44,730 --> 00:08:46,439
outside the back of the apartment with

185
00:08:46,439 --> 00:08:47,970
this laptop and that and do my vlog

186
00:08:47,970 --> 00:08:50,069
outside because I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> very reflected when</font>

187
00:08:50,069 --> 00:08:53,360
outside at night

188
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:57,180
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I decided not to because people's</font>

189
00:08:57,180 --> 00:08:58,890
windows are at the backer open and I

190
00:08:58,890 --> 00:09:00,150
didn't want people hearing him because

191
00:09:00,150 --> 00:09:02,010
people think it's weird but<font color="#E5E5E5"> family is</font>

192
00:09:02,010 --> 00:09:03,870
saying<font color="#CCCCCC"> that when I'm put this on the</font>

193
00:09:03,870 --> 00:09:05,040
internet is for<font color="#CCCCCC"> the whole</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> world to see</font>

194
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:06,660
so what's the difference<font color="#E5E5E5"> and it's what a</font>

195
00:09:06,660 --> 00:09:09,870
lot of people say is they'd<font color="#E5E5E5"> rather put</font>

196
00:09:09,870 --> 00:09:11,040
their problems<font color="#CCCCCC"> out here on the net to</font>

197
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:12,540
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> whole world then tell their friends</font>

198
00:09:12,540 --> 00:09:14,850
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I've had an explanation but you know</font>

199
00:09:14,850 --> 00:09:18,360
I'll leave that for another video few

200
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:20,070
days ago well the last couple days have

201
00:09:20,070 --> 00:09:22,950
had quite weird dreams and<font color="#E5E5E5"> got on a</font>

202
00:09:22,950 --> 00:09:26,130
ramble here I've been thinking about

203
00:09:26,130 --> 00:09:30,510
things<font color="#E5E5E5"> and my life I don't know I've</font>

204
00:09:30,510 --> 00:09:31,830
always been<font color="#E5E5E5"> working to become a</font>

205
00:09:31,830 --> 00:09:35,010
counselor I'm parallel to that doing

206
00:09:35,010 --> 00:09:37,440
stuff in the media and my youtube videos

207
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:39,870
and app and<font color="#CCCCCC"> YouTube is just one of my</font>

208
00:09:39,870 --> 00:09:41,520
favorite things I<font color="#E5E5E5"> really want to make a</font>

209
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:42,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">break free and I've said this from the</font>

210
00:09:42,750 --> 00:09:44,580
very beginning it sets at the beginning

211
00:09:44,580 --> 00:09:47,970
was more desperate you know I am make

212
00:09:47,970 --> 00:09:49,980
claims<font color="#E5E5E5"> for and be featured and stuff</font>

213
00:09:49,980 --> 00:09:51,810
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> this you know which is desired by</font>

214
00:09:51,810 --> 00:09:54,390
many just for me I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> maybe I took it</font>

215
00:09:54,390 --> 00:10:01,830
a bit too far and I<font color="#E5E5E5"> realized that where</font>

216
00:10:01,830 --> 00:10:03,360
I<font color="#E5E5E5"> am in life it doesn't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> matter if I was</font>

217
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:06,630
doing this or<font color="#CCCCCC"> not I've actually not done</font>

218
00:10:06,630 --> 00:10:08,910
much with my<font color="#E5E5E5"> life I'm at university but</font>

219
00:10:08,910 --> 00:10:12,510
I'm not out there with a job and

220
00:10:12,510 --> 00:10:14,790
I learnt even there from the become

221
00:10:14,790 --> 00:10:16,020
accounts for the end of this who knows

222
00:10:16,020 --> 00:10:19,440
it's just really hard to tell and on

223
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:21,150
another night light fitness and that

224
00:10:21,150 --> 00:10:25,800
stuff like this I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> Sun fit it's</font>

225
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:28,050
unbelievable I'd got gym membership for

226
00:10:28,050 --> 00:10:29,670
the year haven't used it because it's

227
00:10:29,670 --> 00:10:33,360
just<font color="#CCCCCC"> so much effort and I just come back</font>

228
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:35,100
we had to move out and move<font color="#CCCCCC"> all</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> what</font>

231
00:10:39,660 --> 00:10:42,060
far and my parents already dropped some

232
00:10:42,060 --> 00:10:43,740
other stuff off so i'm probably not to

233
00:10:43,740 --> 00:10:47,180
do much for the next<font color="#CCCCCC"> four weeks but it's</font>

234

<font color="#CCCCCC">ridiculous light I'm killing myself I</font>

235
00:10:53,450 --> 00:10:57,180
aki guess but I'm killing myself and it

236
00:10:57,180 --> 00:10:59,040
makes<font color="#E5E5E5"> me think if I was to turn my life</font>

237
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:02,100
around<font color="#CCCCCC"> health-wise does that prevent</font>

238
00:11:02,100 --> 00:11:04,530
stuff from happening<font color="#E5E5E5"> lay on in life to</font>

239
00:11:04,530 --> 00:11:06,720
say that worries me is like<font color="#E5E5E5"> when were</font>

240
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:08,730

I think but you know we<font color="#E5E5E5"> will lift today</font>

244
00:11:16,050 --> 00:11:20,790
I guess but the reason I thought about

245
00:11:20,790 --> 00:11:22,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">it was you know when you gonna sleep and</font>

246
