otherwise oceanic Institute dr. David
heimbach is studying how plastic is
becoming a permanent part of our
ecosystem so this bird was incidental
till then you see the hoax coming around
is this is the gizzard max when it hurts
out of the way just ah I did some
tactics
whoa okay for that a 2015 study
predicted that as many as 90% of all
seabirds worldwide now consume plastic
as part of their diet I was eating my
fantastical travel
it could be coming from anyone I mean
we're finding plastic in Antarctic
species you know places where people
don't really go so this is really a
global issue
