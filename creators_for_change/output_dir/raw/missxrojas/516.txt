4
00:00:06,750 --> 00:00:09,090
finding my youtube videos I don't know

5
00:00:09,090 --> 00:00:12,030

00:00:12,030 --> 00:00:14,759
mouth people he won't at<font color="#CCCCCC"> University and</font>

7
00:00:14,759 --> 00:00:16,770

8
00:00:16,770 --> 00:00:19,770
term and a half or so coming<font color="#CCCCCC"> up to me</font>

9
00:00:19,770 --> 00:00:22,710

YouTube it's kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of weird I get a bit</font>

11
00:00:25,830 --> 00:00:27,990
embarrassed and shy and<font color="#E5E5E5"> sometimes a</font>

12
00:00:27,990 --> 00:00:29,400
little bit grumpy about and<font color="#E5E5E5"> not because</font>

13
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:31,380
I'm ashamed this whole wall but just

14
00:00:31,380 --> 00:00:34,649
because I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> know it's like it's a</font>

15
00:00:34,649 --> 00:00:38,129
big part of my routine and my day I

16
00:00:38,129 --> 00:00:40,620
guess in a way Who I am the whole videos

17
00:00:40,620 --> 00:00:42,149

idea of new media and editing and all

19
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:46,739
that all that jazz which sounds

20
00:00:46,739 --> 00:00:49,079
completely pop<font color="#E5E5E5"> seemed ridiculous good</font>

21
00:00:49,079 --> 00:00:50,700
you know you just<font color="#E5E5E5"> you don't go around</font>

22
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:53,280
telling everyone that you put yourself

23
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:54,899
