well number one the time she's never done that because really what they've done is virtually you know it's treason you can call it a lot of things but to think that you have somebody and all of the cabinet so many people as you know they came forward they're writing editorials they're all saying you know it's got to be at a fairly low level because so many people today I was just coming out and I see all the people that are saying such great things we have a lot of love in the administration and the White House is truly welcome back to am joy well Donald Trump is fuming over that anonymous New York Times op-ed and demanding to know who wrote it and so far more than two dozen members of the administration have come forward in ritualistic fashion to assure their leader with all the fervor they can muster that they are absolutely loyal that no sir it was not me who betrayed you well of course that's not good enough for Donald Trump he now wants to use the full power of the federal government to find the writer taking a break from humiliating his attorney general to demand that he get it done because I would say Jeff should be investigating the author of that piece was because I really believe it's national security Trump says finding the writer is a matter of national security though he didn't specify what crime he thinks has been committed what is clear is that the writer is describing what you could call an actual deep state within the government an unelected bureaucracy hired by the president which is nonetheless working to run the executive branch in his place what the writer euphemistically calls the work of a steady state adding that they whoever they are we'll do whatever we can to steer the administration in the right direction until one way or another it's over of course steering the administration in the right direction didn't involve stopping the separation and caging of immigrant children or using the constitutional option of removing Trump by the 25th amendment no the right direction is apparently the one where the resistor gets to preserve the things they like you know tax cuts for the rich and deregulation of big business mean it the rider is basically every Republican in Washington not sure that's what the resistance means back with me business and political marketing consultant Tara Dowdell Dean Obeidallah up the Dean of it all a show on Sirius XM moveon.org senior adviser Kareem jean-pierre and we're joining the conversation former chief spokesman for the Justice Department under President Barack Obama Matthew Miller thank you all for being here so mushy guessing wrote a piece that really kind of captures my kind of concerns about this Matt and her piece in The New Yorker talks about this anonymous person thinking that they're saving the country and says that while warding Donald Trump's short term the you know sort of extreme parts of his agenda maybe in the company the country shall based in the short run it's also it also plainly signals the demise of some of its most cherished ideals and constitutional norms an anonymous person or persons cannot govern for the people because the people do not know who is governing does it concern you I mean you know Barbie to me do it agree with Sarah Huckabee Sanders on something but nobody elected whoever this is to run the country and now they don't want us to know who they are they just say trust us don't worry we've got this we're running the country yeah I think it's exactly right look I think it's evidence of the kind of permanent crisis that we live in and this is a you know a very imperfect and flawed solution to it one I think that ultimately is not not the right solution the solution to having a president who is who as the author writes is a moral who acts recklessly who acts incompetently who acts at times in in in contradiction with you know the with our law and the rule of law the the solution to that problem is not to try to undermine that that that president from the inside through and through undemocratic actions as masha gessen wrote you know somebody who's not elected the answer is to remove that person from office and so I think you know I've struggled with this question for a long time what should people you know what should people who work inside the administration do if you're someone like Jim mattis are you better serve the country by staying and trying to constrain the president or do you better serve the country by leaving and I think there was a time when you could make the argument and especially for national security positions you were better serving the country by staying inside but at this point in time where you see the president under direct assault in a couple of different legal investigations you see his poll numbers really moving in a way that we haven't seen before where he's down you know around 36 37 percent I think that the much more responsible course of action would be for people to come forward in high-profile resignations and say what they've seen on the inside and if one person does it you might see other people come forward and you might see people that have left the administration like HR McMaster and Gary Cohn who all know how unfit this president is but it said nothing you might see them actually come forward and that might actually make a difference yeah absolutely and you know morale Semana gold has claimed that people are being asked to sign NDA so that they can't speak out afterwards she said she didn't sign one but that other people did meaning even if they do agree with this writer they can't even say anything this doesn't sound like a small D democracy to me but I want to play former President Obama on this very point about the New York Times op-ed in that epic speech that he did on Friday take a listen the claim that everything will turn out okay because there are people inside the White House who secretly aren't following the president's orders that is not a check I'm being serious here that's not how our democracy is supposed to work these people aren't elected accountable they're not doing us a service by actively promoting 90% of the crazy stuff that's coming out of this White House and then saying don't worry we're preventing the other 10% right Karine this person wants is clearly to be seen as a hero and be fitted for their Superman cape but who told who elected this person to run the government and by the way they're like but we're making sure the rich people get their tax cuts so don't worry yeah yeah which is kind of like yeah it's it's it's tells you exactly where they really are in all of this but look it's it's self-serving it they're not a hero at all what they're trying to do is rewrite history so that it's favorable to them and I mean these are the same the same person and he talks about other people the person talks about other people being part of the quote unquote of resistance that stood by the president who put babies and cages who refused to denounce neo-nazis who are marching on Charlottesville to a year ago who who signed the Muslim ban and if they truly truly wanted to save this country I agree with Matt they should come out in a in a very public way in front of Congress in front of the American public and say exactly what's going on but this is completely self-serving and it's like I say covering their behinds that's all this is about and you know Terry in a lot of ways it's actually exacerbating some of trumps worst most authoritarian instincts now there's talk of purges there's talk of him going in and trying to use the Department of Justice to investigate here's Donald Trump literally equating an op ed someone writing an op-ed to a national security emergency here he is we're gonna take a look at what he had what he gave also where he is right now supposing I have a high level of national security and he has got a clearance you know we talked about the lyric system a lot recently and he goes into a high-level meeting concerning China or Russia or North Korea or something and this guy goes in I don't want him in those men the New York Times response to that tear was the president's threats both underscore why we must safeguard the identity of the writer of this op-ed and serve as a reminder of the importance of a free and independent press up to American democracy what do you make of the idea that now Donald Trump you know and again I'm quoting somebody on CNN this morning saying he wants to essentially turn the DOJ into the KGB to find this person because he claims writing op-eds that are mean about him is a national security emergency exactly we know that Donald Trump has authoritarian instincts obviously I'm I'm a Captain Obvious here right in this moment but but on its on a serious note we know what authoritarians do when they think that they're people within their administration who are actively trying to sabotage them or if they want to pretend that they're people in their ministration who are actively sabotaging them to do what they want to do right so we know if you look at erawan in Turkey he used the coup to clamp down on on Turkey which was becoming a much more democratic country he used that coup to seize more power to clamp down and Donald Trump has been watching these these autocrats he watches them he admires them and so he is emulating their behavior and so it is actually more damaging I think for this person to to behave in the way that they're behaving by being anonymous because it gives him something to kind of latch on to to then to start to do these things and and unfortunately there are a lot of Americans that see Donald Trump and and buy into this deep state and I'm not just talking about his base there people who have problems with the FBI for their own reasons I mean I have issues with the FBI I know I don't know spouse to Trump's thinking but you know there are people in this country that then that see that and it can if you're loosely paying attention to the news you're not somebody that's engaged that much politically and you see some of this behavior you might buy into some of the rhetoric and so so I think that this way that this person approached it I agree with John a cream jump here it is completely self-serving and I think that it does further make Trump more danger you see the dictator in Saudi Arabia doing the same thing all these purges of a the you know this disloyalty to me personally right it's disloyalty to the state and I'm gonna investigate you masha guys who wrote something else that I wanted to point out on for you Dean and she and she also look it's New York Times in playing along and helping this authoritarian process going along and she says the thing about autocracies or budding autocracies is that they present citizens with only bad choices at a certain point one has to stop trying to find the right solution and one has to look instead for a course of action that avoids complicity by publishing the anonymous op-ed The Times became complicit in its own corruption your thoughts I don't agree with that view that they're complicit in their own corruption I think on some level Donald Trump is spinning out of control more unhinged than ever he could not even pronounce the word anonymous at his rally nominee I'm ramanamma and I'm gonna stand over and over and over and I just envision some scene from the movie The Untouchables he's walkin on with a bat around a cabinet meeting right finding out who's at fault who's not to me the New York Times reporting this I think a good news agency they vet it they find out who the person is it's true I think you print it that's fine let were things fall where they go but the idea that this person is in the resistance is a joke we are the resistance if you're opposed to only 10% of Donald Trump's plans you're not any resistance you're doing nothing but trying to put up the window shades nicely and make things look good so it's palatable for the rest of America to sell a far right-wing horrible policy if you're in the resistance you oppose everything Donald Trump stuff putting corporations over people the idea of embolden bigots and white supremacists not denouncing Nazis and the list goes on and on and on so to me my greatest pushback on this article's idea they're they're resistant no no no we are the resist we oppose everything this man has done and I mean but you know to Masha Gessen point the American people now do not know who is essentially effectively according to them governing the country but they do so now we have one ant I made a couple editors know who is making policy that they were not elected to make and the rest of us don't know who that is so I am you know just to take her point but I want to play what I think is probably the most damning piece of sound in all of this and this is Republicans response to the idea that Donald Trump is seen as so unstable by his own members of his own senior administer senior members of his own administration that they thought about 25th amendment meaning him and now our governing in his place take a listen there was much new information there I hope think more will come out publicly this is what all of us have understood to be the situation from day one it's just so similar to what so many of us hear from senior people around the White House you know three times a week so it's really troubling and yet in a way not surprising Matt Miller I would say that the only thing more troubling than Donald Trump hiring his own deep state and then being overrun by them is a Republican Party that literally doesn't care it is really amazing to watch those those those clips it's like watching someone say look well I don't need you to tell me the house is on fire I already knew the house is on fire I can see the flames all around me but yet they don't call the fire part department they don't grab a fight you know a hose and try to put anything out they don't do anything about it it's a it's this reaction we see to Donald Trump over and over again we saw it in the reaction to his call for sessions to investigate and prosecute the the author of this of this op-ed a complete you know it would be a complete abuse of power and you see people kind of shrug and say oh well he calls for this abuse of power all the time the fact that he does it all the time is not evidence that we that this is an acceptable status quote it's a evidence of the crisis we live in every day and the response to that crisis is not to shrug your shoulders and act like what we've been seeing it for a year and a half the response to that crisis is to do something about it yeah and I think the scariest prospect is that Jeff Sessions under you know beleaguered and under fire decides to do it that is the thing that we have to we don't know we just don't know the answer to whether he would do it Tara and Corrine are sticking around Dean Obeidallah matthew Miller thank you guys very much enjoy the rest of your day and up next the guessing game over who wrote
