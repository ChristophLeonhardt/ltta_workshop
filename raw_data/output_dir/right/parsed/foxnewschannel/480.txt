THIS FBI INVESTIGATION COULD
HAVE STARTED A LONG TIME AGO.
>> PRESIDENT TRUMP TONIGHT
DIRECTING THE FBI TO DIG INTO
KAVANAUGH'S BACKGROUND FOR A
SEVENTH TIME, SAYING, QUOTE,
I'VE ORDERED THE FBI TO UPDATE
KAVANAUGH'S FILE.
THIS UPDATE MUST BE LIMITED IN
SCOPE AND COMPLETED IN LESS THAN
ONE WEEK.
DOJ PROSECUTOR IS HERE TO
SEPARATE FACT FROM FICTION ABOUT
HOW THIS IS REALLY GOING TO
WORK.
OKAY.
SO THE FBI, LET'S TALK ABOUT
THIS.
SHANNON, A WHITE HOUSE
CORRESPONDENT SAYS, A NOTE ON
WHAT THE FBI CAN OR CAN'T DO.
THEY CAN'T SUBPOENA RECORDS OR
FORCE ANYONE TO TESTIFY.
WHAT ARE THEY GOING TO DO?
>> I THINK THERE'S A LOT OF
MISCONCEPTIONS.
THE FBI WILL GATHER FACTS.
NOW, NORMALLY THIS IS DOWN FAR
PRIOR BEFORE WE GOT INTO A
PROCESS LIKE THIS, WHEN THINGS
ARE STILL CONFIDENTIAL.
THE FACT IS THAT NOW WE'RE
TIPPED OFF TO THESE ALLEGATIONS.
THE FBI IS KIND OF A HYBRID.
YOU'RE RIGHT.
NO SUBPOENA AUTHORITY.
THEY CAN ASK QUESTIONS, THEY CAN
ASK FOR STATEMENTS, THEY CAN GET
SOME RECORDS, BUT AGAIN, THERE'S
NO PHYSICAL OR FORENSIC EVIDENCE
HERE, THERE'S NO ELECTRONIC
EVIDENCE HERE.
IT'S FAR TOO OLD FOR THAT.
THEY'RE REALLY GOING TO BE
LIMITED TO ABOUT HALF A DOZEN
PEOPLE, LARGELY WHAT'S ALREADY
BEEN DONE BY THE SENATE.
>> EVERY ONE OF THEM HAS GIVEN
SOME KIND OF STATEMENT.
TONIGHT WE'RE HEARING FROM
SEVERAL OF HERE AGAIN WILLING TO
PARTICIPATE.
NPR SAYING THIS.
THE FBI WILL NOT GIVE ITS OWN
DETERMINATION ABOUT THE
TRUTHFULNESS OF WHAT WITNESSES
SAY.
THEY OPPOSED ACTIVATING THE
BUREAU.
INVESTIGATORS PROBABLY WILL ONLY
CONDUCT INTERVIEWS AND PASS THEM
ONTO THE SENATE.
>> WE'RE GOING TO COME FULL
CIRCLE.
LET'S SAY AN INVESTIGATION IS
BEING DONE OF ME BECAUSE I'M
BEING NOMINATED OF SOME
POSITION.
THEY TALK TO MY CHILDHOOD
FRIENDS AND THEY SAY I COMMITTED
ARENA ACT BACK THEN.
THEY MAY TALK TO PEOPLE, BUT
THEY WON'T TRY TO PROVE OR
DISPROVE THE ACT HAPPENED.
THEY'LL TAKE THE EVIDENCE TO THE
SENATE AND SAY, "HERE YOU GO,
BUT YOU THE SENATE HAVE TO MAKE
THE DECISION ABOUT WHETHER OR
NOT THIS IS CREDIBLE AND WHAT TO
DO WITH IT.
>> WHAT ABOUT A ONE-WEEK
TIMEFRAME HERE?
DR. FORD'S ATTORNEYS ARE SAYING
THERE SHOULDN'T BE ANY
ARTIFICIAL GUIDELINES OR
RECONTRIBUTIONS ON THIS.
IS THAT DOABLE?
>> WHETHER OR NOT IT'S GOING TO
PACIFY THE MINORITY, AND THAT'S
ANOTHER QUESTION ENTIRELY, I
GUARANTEE VERY LITTLE WILL COME
FROM THIS INVESTIGATION.
IT'S VERY UNLIKELY THEY WILL ADD
MUCH TO THIS PROCESS.
WHAT IS VERY LIKELY IS THAT
WHATEVER THEY FIND WILL BE
REJECTED BY THE MINORITY AS
INSUFFICIENT.
>> LYING IS A BIG PROBLEM.
>> BIG PROBLEM.
SAME AS LYING TO THE SENATE.
