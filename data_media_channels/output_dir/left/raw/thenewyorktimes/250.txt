1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,290
There’s Bitcoin.

2
00:00:01,290 --> 00:00:02,430
There’s Litecoin.

3
00:00:02,430 --> 00:00:03,810
There’s Ethereum.

4
00:00:03,810 --> 00:00:07,260
So just what is cryptocurrency,
and how does it work?

5
00:00:07,260 --> 00:00:11,370
Essentially, it’s digital money
that’s bought and sold online.

6
00:00:11,370 --> 00:00:13,080
There’s no bills or coins.

7
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:15,712
It’s not based on
another asset like gold.

8
00:00:15,712 --> 00:00:17,500
And it doesn’t go
through traditional

9
00:00:17,500 --> 00:00:19,860
financial institutions
like banks.

10
00:00:19,860 --> 00:00:22,270
Instead, these
currencies operate

11
00:00:22,270 --> 00:00:24,210
in a completely
decentralized system

12
00:00:24,210 --> 00:00:27,000
that uses so-called
blockchain technology

13
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,670
to track transactions.

14
00:00:28,670 --> 00:00:30,820
To see how this works,
let’s look at how

15
00:00:30,820 --> 00:00:32,980
you’d buy something
with cryptocurrency.

16
00:00:33,690 --> 00:00:35,810
Say that Alice wants
to buy a bike from Dan

17
00:00:35,810 --> 00:00:38,590
using Bitcoin, her
cryptocurrency of choice.

18
00:00:39,010 --> 00:00:41,680
Alice begins by logging
into her Bitcoin wallet

19
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:44,180
with a private key,
a unique combination

20
00:00:44,180 --> 00:00:46,140
of letters and numbers.

21
00:00:46,140 --> 00:00:48,440
With a traditional
financial transaction,

22
00:00:48,440 --> 00:00:51,050
the exchanges get sent
to banks on each side

23
00:00:51,050 --> 00:00:53,430
who record the money being
subtracted from one account

24
00:00:53,430 --> 00:00:54,840
and added to another.

25
00:00:55,530 --> 00:00:57,350
But remember,
in this scenario,

26
00:00:57,350 --> 00:00:59,100
there are no banks
or middlemen.

27
00:00:59,670 --> 00:01:01,580
Instead, Alice’s transaction

28
00:01:01,580 --> 00:01:04,660
is shared with everyone
in the Bitcoin network.

29
00:01:04,660 --> 00:01:07,270
These networked computers
add Alice’s transaction

30
00:01:07,270 --> 00:01:10,940
to a shared list of recent
transactions, known as a block.

31
00:01:10,940 --> 00:01:12,200
Every 10 minutes,

32
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:13,880
the newest block
of transactions is

33
00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:17,440
added on, or chained,
to all the previous blocks.

34
00:01:17,440 --> 00:01:19,760
That’s how you get
a blockchain.

35
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:22,370
To ensure that each
block of transactions

36
00:01:22,370 --> 00:01:24,100
on the chain is verified,

37
00:01:24,100 --> 00:01:26,370
a subset of Bitcoin’s
network joins a race

38
00:01:26,370 --> 00:01:28,720
to solve a difficult
math puzzle.

39
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:30,950
And if they solve
it first, their record

40
00:01:30,950 --> 00:01:34,350
of the block of transactions
becomes the official record.

41
00:01:34,350 --> 00:01:36,760
They’re rewarded with
Bitcoins of their own,

42
00:01:36,760 --> 00:01:39,560
and the network gets a
new block on the chain.

43
00:01:40,180 --> 00:01:42,490
This entire process
is known as mining.

44
00:01:42,490 --> 00:01:44,130
But instead of
chipping away at rock,

45
00:01:44,130 --> 00:01:46,670
you’re solving
complex puzzles.

46
00:01:46,670 --> 00:01:48,720
The fact that many
computers are competing

47
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:51,880
to verify a block ensures
that no single computer

48
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:54,310
can monopolize
the Bitcoin market.

49
00:01:54,310 --> 00:01:57,330
To ensure the competition
stays fair and evenly timed,

50
00:01:57,330 --> 00:02:01,410
the puzzle becomes harder
when more computers join in.

51
00:02:01,410 --> 00:02:03,890
The Bitcoin protocol says
mining will continue

52
00:02:03,890 --> 00:02:07,130
until there are 21 million
Bitcoins in existence.

53
00:02:07,130 --> 00:02:09,960
That’s set to happen
around 2140 —

54
00:02:09,960 --> 00:00:00,000
if Bitcoin lasts that long.
