hi I'm for me okay and you are in the stream today we're talking and singing soca music if you're not familiar with the unique blend of East Indian and African rhythms that's been making ways around the world you're in for a treat hmm I'm Malika Bilal our guest today is soca royalty Trinidadian singer and songwriter nyla Blackman as always I'll be looking out for your comments live on YouTube so send them my way and we've already heard from numerous soca fans from around the world sharing some of their favorite lyrics from my love songs take a look hola Roy he Getti not see ya hola he Getti that see ya done already damn man I read a watch it come for me watch he come for me for no man to see what golly David he better be a boom boom I got this errbody de thing give it to me that workout give it to me that love give it to me and our cows give it to me that love in the house and in good voice you're gonna hear more my life's again in a moment but first what you were singing yes what those little clips were singing that was soca music yes if people are just listening right now I'm thinking what is that what would you say I would say this is the blend of East Indian and African rhythm and this is trim big oh yes there's so much more to it than just blending and fusion we have lots of music that does that oh yeah and the world yeah but there's a particular story to how this happened yeah I know family is part of that story it they're definitely very instrumental my grandfather's late great rush or tea I also known as Lord Shorty and he was the one that started soca music in Trinidad and in the Caribbean before there was soca there was Calypso and he felt like there was a divide between the East Indian and the Africans living in Trinidad and he wanted a music for them to be one so that we would no longer be Indian and African but will be Trinidadian Antron big Union and that was really how suka these thoughts about it started you know I mean he was part of his mom was a doula which is a mixture between Indian and African and he had his grandfather was an indian man but he was seen as a black boy so growing up in East Indian village he faced a lot of racial discrimination because of his color because of what he looked like but he was part Indian so he always wanted to connect the two so that there wouldn't be this divide anymore and after so many years of experiments in with music because he was a Calypso nyan first he decided that he was gonna make Sokka yeah and that's why it's not it and it is resonating and has resonated so we got several tweets about people's appreciation for the music and of course also for the history and how it came to be this is true now who is picking up on that idea of it United groups of people she says I think SOPA is the dance hall of Calypso I believe what's created to be a band-aid to the knife wound of racial tension and racism it is usually sufficient for the duration of the songs or season but that's about as effective as it gets so even though she seems to like the idea of it that healing racial tensions she says it's a certain part of year that that happens would you push back against that would you agree um I definitely do agree because I believe that we always like to have the idea of being united and we definitely are our own carnival time we have this festival in Chanel and Caribbean called carnival it started in Trinidad and that's really where people feel because so car drives carnival so car is what makes carnival carnival and at that point in time it doesn't matter who you are you could be a vagrant on the street somebody is gonna love you somebody's gonna make you feel amazing because we're just loving each other that that's a that's a special time of the year you know and it's sad but soca shines at that point in time and then as ya go by it dies and so does the love you know so does the appreciation for one another and that unity attitude it goes away you know I wanna show a picture of you with your granddad no shorty here I'm not sure who looks more surprised you are your granddad I probably was just finished crying oh not to you so much so that you put him on the top of one of your videos why did you do that because because of the history of the music I would always see it's very sad but I think I live in a society where we have amnesia people forget people don't like to give respect where respect is due and he has worked so hard and fought so hard to create something and yes people know that he was he want to start it but they don't always give him the credit and I feel like I wanted to remind them where it all comes from because I mean we have so much culture coming out of trend on Sebago I mean we have carnival DCU Panasonic instrument it was created right there Inchon on Sebago this tiny twin islands these tiny twin islands right off of Venezuela at the end of the Caribbeans doing a humble brag but more right right yeah we have Calypso Calypso was created right ins in in Trinidad we have soca music and we are not taught these things in school we are not we are not taught our culture enough and I wanted people to know I think that there's not a lot of young people in soca music so young people don't they they don't connect as much well I I thought so because when I was younger I didn't connect as much because there wasn't anybody my age doing it I'm doing it big and well so I felt like how are the younger ones going to know about the history about what we have so I thought it was so important for them to know their culture know their history I know like you know what I mean so that's why I felt the need to show them what exactly so come out because people here soca music and it's like oh let's party let's have a good time but it's more than that so much more which is why you put your granddad on the top of one of your videos yeah I can tell it's an old VHS tape little tape yeah let's have a listen to what Lord shorty how he described soca music soca is a combination of East Indian and African rhythm the purpose of soca in in the 70s a real about anywhere on 69 to 70 but the purpose was to bring the East Indian and the Africans and surely not together so there was a combination of the two main rhythm extractors in Trinidad to to create a song that would would be totally Trinidad and let us call it a to glory dollars so that was Lord shorty Malika what do you have so it's because of Lord shorten his relation to you of course he's your grandfather then we got to its like this from Amilcar who says she is soca royalty as she should be regarded her family like the Marley's in Jamaica are recognized for their national cultural contribution but he goes on to say something that you mentioned earlier about being a young voice he says I love soca and nyla Blackman is a critical voice of a cast of young voices who blend now traditional Calypso expressions and current global music trends with a global Caribbean aesthetic further as a female she's in a lane of her own that's a it's a it's a weighty thing but do you see yourself as that young voice who is mixing those two things where no one else is I definitely think so because I think that the problem with the youths and it's not it's a problem but it's actually not a problem at the same time is that we are looking for examples and the examples that we have it's not necessarily we don't know how to recreate it we don't know how to make it brand new again we don't know how to make it trendy like what is happening now and it's like we share the same thing over and over and over and I which is tired of that I love soca music and I'm just like why can't I hear something different why why does it sound like the same old song again you know so I felt they need to do that and I think that now that's inspiring more young people to have their voice and understand that my voice doesn't need to be just like the voices before it can be completely different and I can still get true as we say get true yeah that is a perfect transition for us because you say you are not the same old sound nylon is going to play a song for us that really brought you into the spotlight it's a 20-17 collaboration with musician casts called work out and while nyla prepares for her acoustic version of the hit have a listen to this video comment from Richard rum sunder was a soca analyst and a vlogger on diversity within soca music and the way it's been embraced across the islands and the world I'm always amazed to see how different islands and different types of people from all over the world create their own type of sound with soca music for example here in st. Lucia they have Lucien kuduro ordinary segments in Guyana they have their own type of soca same thing in Barbados they have soca music just for crop over' grenada has music just for spice mas and st. Vincent they have their own unique sound for Vincent mas and all the way in Japan Japanese cigars make their own soca music with Japanese lyrics for their carnival as well so it's incredible to see the amount of diversity that comes from soca music baby show me dodging Olay driving me crazy - Maddie - Maddie now give you - nobody you - Maddie - Maddie original my bottle copy you know we never over you send me loca oh I love love love you giving me pressure ha ha ha ha ride your life and you know until we end up on the wrong we meet nothing baby no no no no I'm I'm doing end up on the ground and you know multiplied by a thousand classes you're watching out to zero right now by the way and that is neither black people online no it you to lots of YouTube and tweets coming in so Elmo card says Nilo Blackman will be remembered for having a guitar singing live performing in local cafes and bars to create room to define her voice presence and individuality no cakewalk she earned her keep enough respect someone else watching live on YouTube writes in a question for you does she feel that women in soca face certain obstacles that her male counterparts don't I definitely think so um soca is a male-dominated industry I'm actually the first woman in about I could say a decade tenure has to break truthfully in soca and it's because it's so hard the things that women have to go through because our culture where Carnival is concerned and music in general it's it's very over sexualized and women feel the pressure to have to do that to get somewhere and it's not fair and a lot of a lot of men take advantage of that and a lot of women are not strong enough to deal with that and some ah we definitely have amazing women doing it right now but it's it's very unfortunate that we would have to go through something like that but a lot of girls have to deal with just fight to play their music or to do things in exchange to get publicity and it's it's not fair but it's how women are treated in this industry I'm one of the women he's out there doing it is your mum your entire family um yeah - yeah you had a musician yeah and if you resist it I want to show a little bit of a be Blackman this is an eyeless mom Oh sokka strong yeah oh my goodness what a powerful role model your mom is doing that but the way that you put your music videos together you the lyrics are very powerful but also the visuals are very powerful I'm trying to think of how I say you are smart hot and sexy thank you about the way women are seen in soaker yeah but you are also incredibly sensuous in the way that you present yourself yeah is that not a is that an irony in that or what are you trying to do um the thing about it is that I am naturally that we I've always been but a lot of women are not and they feel they need to have to be that way okay you know okay this gives you an idea of what your usual videos look like when you sing in here um all are oh it's an expression that we see in the Caribbean it's like oh gosh like oh my lord and you know it's it's just like a sigh of relief you know what I mean hola doy the question here keeping that in mind this is from Sofia who's really excited we're doing this show Sofia says what does she have to say that the critics who disapprove of her style in sofa music um what do I have to say to the critics that disapprove of my style and soca music well you know I really don't pay attention to the negativity because there's so much positivity coming at me I mean I'm here today so I don't pay attention to it but I think that a lot of people are not comfortable it makes them very uncomfortable change they're not comfortable with change because it's not traditional and it's not the way it's been done before they they feel uncomfortable and it makes them you know they would say things who want it to be the same way and this is this is the sort of fight that my grandfather got when he had created soca music because what was known are what was done was Calypso and was social commentary and it was was a lot slower and it wasn't it wasn't like soca so Calypso was very different and people shunned him for trying to change it and he got a lot of bash for it but then how much ever years later it's like the biggest thing ever so I watched that and I watch a lot of people that go through similar situations in in the world and I say that if you in have no haters you and pop in and now it's tweeted out right I think one of the things about where you come from Trinidad and Tobago is that we see it as here it's beautiful it's stunning people enjoy carnival but then you take the music formless soca and then you talk about some very serious issues and that is a challenge for a lot of people because it's so happy the music's Dali's and you want to dance to it and then you hit them with big boned black chrome so own yourself yeah and own your blackness and how do you make that work for people how does that resonate with people um I think it resonates really well because not just in the Caribbean I mean all over the world I feel like racism is a problem and discrimination in general is a problem and there's this idea of beauty and if girls don't fit in that then they feel insecure and they this is a lot of weighing on your shoulder and I wanted to tell girls it is a matter how you look you should understand that you are beautiful it doesn't matter the color of your skin it doesn't matter what size if you're a small big extra big it doesn't matter like you are beautiful in yourself because you are you so thick chrome black bones like you know people's highlights the red bones yellow bones the every bone but where's my black bone girls you know I mean so I thought it was important me as a black bone girl to to say you know yeah which is why we got common like this YouTube Nepal says so Patel stories of our struggle as well not just the partying so nyla we have to pause you there and to our community we'll see you online and an eye-level play us out joined by DJ spice for a mash-up of two of her hit songs by la mami and soca but first have a listen to Trinidadian journalist so you need grey explain what makes my line her music so unique what I think really significant about nyla is her voice like when she came out there was a lot of conversation about how unusual her voice is and the fact that she's been able to find success in such an exclusive genre the international success I think is really really good I don't think it's as important I think authenticity and being able to have your own voice in this cultural honor and finding your own success would be it's like girls go hardest eyes on spot paradise it's like training when I say my people dancing Lola here is all day how nice no bro wha no you
