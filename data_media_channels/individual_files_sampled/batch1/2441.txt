welcome back and let's get started with your questions and our answers our first question from econ analyst is why is voting not worthwhile but playing the lottery is that answer is really easy somebody wins when you play the lottery when you vote nobody wins except a crooked politician next question in light of the feds commitment to almost zero interest rates can we expect mortgage rates to move down from here unfortunately probably not but you're probably asking the wrong question you don't want to try to time the mortgage market to get the lowest interest rates and possible what you want to do is buy a house that you want to live in and with a mortgage you can afford who is your favorite economist living or dead and why the answer is obviously Jesus Christ I'll return to that i would say other than our Lord and Savior the answer would be Ludwig von Mises and Frederick Hayek I think that both of them opened new ground in economics and formulated the answers that are most telling for a current crisis would you have thought that it would take more than 12 months for the business media to get over a IG and to start cheering for insurance companies making all in wages that's from our reader tin box well tin box I'm still outraged about AIG and as long as they still have piles of our money which I expect them to have for all of eternity I'll never get over it and I hope the rest of the business media doesn't either next question from bid whacker CNBC or Bloomberg TV that's an easy answer to CNBC they invite me on all the time Bloomberg not so much from Paul Krugman whose beard do you like better Paul Krugman's or Ben Bernanke's well Paul I'm glad you asked the best beard in economics is Charles beard the US economic historian are you got this question comes from Matt Damon Matt I'm glad you're watching are you guys at all concerned with helping the average American process and understand what's going on around them to not get their home foreclosed on or go bankrupt or are you just trying to get as much traffic as possible that's a trick question Matt of course we want to inform people and let them know what they need to do to remain prosperous but we think the best way for them to do that is to visit our site as much as possible so they go hand in hand finally our final question is what do you think is a greater threat to the country werewolves or the zombie apocalypse from client number nine well client nine that's also a trick question very clearly the true threat to our republic is the Anunnaki the reptilian lizards who have been controlling human civilization for 3,000 years thank you this has been you ask we answer with the business insider sponsored by r in the makers of the blackberry see you next time
