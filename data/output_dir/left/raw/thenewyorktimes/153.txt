00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:03,240
This image has become
a powerful representation

2
00:00:03,240 --> 00:00:06,440
of the Trump administration’s
crackdown on immigration:

3
00:00:06,440 --> 00:00:08,330
a 2-year old girl sobbing,

4
00:00:08,330 --> 00:00:11,580
as U.S. border patrol agents
searched her mother.

5
00:00:12,850 --> 00:00:15,410
“If you cross the border unlawfully,

6
00:00:15,410 --> 00:00:17,780
then we will prosecute you.

7
00:00:17,780 --> 00:00:19,890
If you are smuggling a child,

8
00:00:19,890 --> 00:00:23,140
then we will
prosecute you.

9
00:00:23,140 --> 00:00:25,090
And that child may be separated

10
00:00:25,090 --> 00:00:27,980
from you as required by law.”

11
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:31,910
The Trump White House’s tactic
of systematically separating

12
00:00:31,910 --> 00:00:35,190
migrant families is
a dramatic shift.

13
00:00:35,190 --> 00:00:36,740
There have been
cases of families

14
00:00:36,740 --> 00:00:39,780
being separated under the
previous two administrations.

15
00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:41,640
But it’s always
been the exception,

16
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:42,910
not the rule.

17
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:46,520
That said, Trump’s
crackdowns are happening

18
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:49,100
against the backdrop
of more than a decade

19
00:00:49,100 --> 00:00:52,400
of stepped-up enforcement
at the Southern border.

20
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:54,860
In 2005,
President George W. Bush

21
00:00:54,860 --> 00:00:58,520
launched “Operation Streamline”
along the Texas border.

22
00:00:58,520 --> 00:01:01,910
He was responding to a spike
in apprehensions there.

23
00:01:01,910 --> 00:01:03,560
The program called
for criminally

24
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:05,400
prosecuting all migrants.

25
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:07,870
“We’re going to get
control of our borders.

26
00:01:07,870 --> 00:01:12,500
We’re making this country safer
for all our citizens.”

27
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:15,710
The idea of zero tolerance
took root under Bush,

28
00:01:15,710 --> 00:01:20,110
and it’s what Trump has
used to model his policy after.

29
00:01:20,110 --> 00:01:22,200
The Bush-era program
meant that migrants who

30
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:24,290
were caught in
certain border states

31
00:01:24,290 --> 00:01:26,330
were put through
the criminal system,

32
00:01:26,330 --> 00:01:28,750
not civil immigration courts.

33
00:01:28,750 --> 00:01:31,950
It made exceptions for adults
traveling with children,

34
00:01:31,950 --> 00:01:34,580
but others were ushered
through mass trials aimed

35
00:01:34,580 --> 00:01:36,200
at deporting them quickly.

36
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:39,260
It’s a practice that’s
still around today.

37
00:01:39,260 --> 00:01:41,120
“One of the things
we committed to do

38
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:44,990
was end ‘catch and release’ by
the end of fiscal year 2006.”

39
00:01:44,990 --> 00:01:46,730
Under this policy,
migrants were

40
00:01:46,730 --> 00:01:49,190
held until their
deportation hearing.

41
00:01:49,190 --> 00:01:52,310
And that meant an increase
in beds at private detention centers.

42
00:01:55,020 --> 00:01:57,260
In 2014, President Barack Obama

43
00:01:57,260 --> 00:02:00,020
declared a crisis at
the Southwest border

44
00:02:00,020 --> 00:02:02,180
after a surge of
unaccompanied minors,

45
00:02:02,180 --> 00:02:04,350
mostly from Central America.

46
00:02:04,389 --> 00:02:06,829
“We now have an actual
humanitarian crisis on the border

47
00:02:06,829 --> 00:02:09,660
that only underscores
the need to drop the politics

48
00:02:09,660 --> 00:02:12,830
and fix our immigration
system once and for all.”

49
00:02:13,220 --> 00:02:16,460
During that child migrant crisis,
the Obama administration

50
00:02:16,460 --> 00:02:18,860
also focused on
deporting people quickly

51
00:02:18,860 --> 00:02:21,330
and put some through
criminal proceedings.

52
00:02:21,330 --> 00:02:23,300
But it chose to hold
families together

53
00:02:23,300 --> 00:02:27,110
in administrative, not
criminal detention.

54
00:02:27,110 --> 00:02:32,060
The Obama administration also
set up makeshift overflow facilities.

55
00:02:32,060 --> 00:02:35,720
And we saw similar images back
then, of adults and children

56
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:39,980
behind chain-link fences draped
in thermal blankets.

57
00:02:39,980 --> 00:02:43,310
Now, Trump is reportedly
taking it a step further

58
00:02:43,310 --> 00:02:45,680
and considering
makeshift tent cities

59
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:48,650
to detain minors
caught at the border.

60
00:02:48,650 --> 00:02:51,890
The Trump administration says
it’s now merely enforcing

61
00:02:51,890 --> 00:02:53,360
the letter of the law.

62
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:55,460
But images of
children in detention

63
00:02:55,460 --> 00:02:58,680
have made it hard to sell
it in political terms,

64
00:02:58,680 --> 00:00:00,000
and humanitarian ones, too.
