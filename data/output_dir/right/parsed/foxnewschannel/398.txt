WITH JUDGE KAVANAUGH AND ACCUSER
DR. CHRISTINE BLASEY FORD.
IS THIS TAKING US TO A NEW
POLITICAL LOW ON THE OTHER SIDE
OF THE ARGUMENT KEY G.O.P.
SENATORS SAY THAT RESIDENTS
REMARKS ABOUT BLASEY FORD ARE
APPALLING, UNACCEPTABLE AND JUST
PLAIN WRONG.
IF THE NOW FIGHTING BACK.
AS SOON AS THAT FBI REPORT, THE
SEVENTH ON KAVANAUGH, IS
COMPLETED, THE WHITE HOUSE DOES
GET THE FIRST LOVE.
WILL HE CONTINUE TO STAND BY HIS
NOMINEE?
THE ONE AND ONLY SEAN HANNITY IN
HIS "FOX NEWS @ NIGHT" DEBUT.
>> THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME.
CONGRATS MICHELLE.
YOU ARE DOING GREAT AND IT'S AN
HONOR TO BE WITH YOU.
I HAVEN'T BEEN ON THE SHOW.
YOU'VE DONE AMAZING WORK ON
SUPREME COURT ISSUES OVER THE
YEARS AND YOU KNOW THIS ISSUE
VERY WELL.
BUT I DON'T THINK IT'S EVER BEEN
THAT BAD OR THIS BAD AS IT IS
NOW.
THE SAD PART IS TO ME IT'S
GETTING -- ONE POLITICS,
POLITICIANS ARE SAYING GET
SAYING GET IN HER FACE AND THEY
ARE FOLLOWING SARAH SANDERS AND
KICKING HER FAMILY OUT OF A
RESTAURANT OR PAM BONDI OR
SECRETARY NIELSEN, THEN IT'S TED
CRUZ, THEN IT'S MITCH
McCONNELL, NOW THE EXAMPLE
THAT YOU JUST BROUGHT UP AND I'M
THINKING SOMEBODY IS GOING TO
GET HURT HERE.
WE ARE AT A TIPPING POINT BUT
THE BIG CHALLENGE NOW IS THIS,
WHETHER AMERICA IS GOING TO
REMAIN A COUNTRY THAT BELIEVES
IN DUE PROCESS, THE PRESUMPTION
OF INNOCENCE, OUR CONSTITUTION,
THE RULE OF LAW, OR WHETHER OR
NOT GUILT BY ACCUSATION RULES
THE DAY.
AND WE ARE GOING TO FIND OUT
PROBABLY BY FRIDAY, SATURDAY AT
THE LATEST, WHETHER OR NOT
REPUBLICANS ARE GOING TO STAND
UP AGAINST WHAT ARE ALLEGATIONS
THAT HAVE NO CORROBORATION,
INCONSISTENCIES.
IT'S A VERY CRUCIAL MOMENT FOR
THE COUNTRY IN MY VIEW.
>> Shannon: THERE ARE A NUMBER
OF REPUBLICANS WERE ON THE
FENCE.
THEY ARE THE ONES WHO ARE REALLY
WATCHING, A COUPLE OF KEY
DEMOCRATS AS WELL BUT THEY SAY
THEY HAVE A NEGATIVE REACTION TO
THE PRESIDENT LAST NIGHT AND HIS
RALLY.
HERE IS WHAT SENATOR LINDSEY
GRAHAM, A BIG SUPPORTER OF THE
PRESIDENT, HERE'S WHAT HE SAID
ABOUT THOSE COMMENTS FROM LAST
NIGHT.
>> PRESIDENT TRUMP WENT THROUGH
A RENDITION THAT I DIDN'T
PARTICULARLY LIKE AND I WOULD
TELL HIM TO KNOCK IT OFF, YOU'RE
NOT HELPING.
IT COULD BE WORSE.
YOU CAN ACTUALLY KILL SOMEBODY'S
CAT AND PUNCTURE SOMEBODY'S
TIRES TO GET THEM TO SHUT UP.
>> Shannon: 'S REFERENCE THEIR
BACK TO THE CLINTON YEARS.
>> THERE IS A DOUBLE STANDARD.
KEITH ELLISON MORE RECENTLY.
IN THE CASE OF THE WOMAN THAT IS
ACCUSING HIM.
I HAVE NOT HEARD ANY OF THESE
MEMBERS OF THE SENATE JUDICIARY
COMMITTEE OR ANY OF THE
DEMOCRATS CALL FOR AN FBI
INVESTIGATION INTO KEITH ELLISON
AND APPARENTLY THE WOMAN MAKING
THE ALLEGATIONS, HIS TEXT
MESSAGES, TAPE RECORDINGS,
DOCTORS REPORTS AND THEY SAY
NOTHING, OR IN THE CASE OF
BILL CLINTON, IF WE REALLY WANT
TO GO BACK TO PEOPLE EARLIER IN
THEIR LIVES, WE CAN GO BACK TO
WHEN BILL CLINTON WAS THE
ATTORNEY GENERAL, THE RAPE
ACCUSATION.
THE DOUBLE STANDARDS STINKS TO
HIGH HEAVEN.
YOU MENTIONED THREE REPUBLICANS.
THEY ASKED FOR THE FBI REPORT.
MY SOURCES TONIGHT ARE TELLING
ME THAT IT PRETTY MUCH JUST
REITERATES WHAT THE SENATE
JUDICIARY COMMITTEE, THEIR
CONCLUSIONS, WHAT THE
INVESTIGATION IS.
A MEMBER, THE FBI WILL NOT REACH
CONCLUSIONS.
THEY WILL NOT MAKE
RECOMMENDATIONS.
IF THAT'S THE CASE, HOW DID
THESE THREE REPUBLICANS
JUSTIFIED NOW MOVING THE BAR?
MAYBE DOESN'T HAVE THE PROPER
TEMPERAMENT.
>> Shannon: THEY ARE WORRIED
ABOUT THE FACT THAT THE JUDGE
AND THE PROFESSOR IT APPEARS
HAVE NOT BEEN INTERVIEWED.
THEY SAY IT'S NOT COMPLETE
WITHOUT THOSE TWO, ALTHOUGH THEY
HAVE BOTH GIVEN HOURS OF SWORN
TESTIMONY.
>> THEY HAVE GIVEN HOURS OF
SWORN TESTIMONY.
UNLESS THEY HAVE SOMETHING NEW
TO OFFER WE ALREADY KNOW WHERE
THEY STAND, WE KNOW WHAT THEIR
STORIES ARE.
IN THE CASE OF PROFESSOR FORD,
SHE SAID THERE WAS AN EYEWITNESS
TO THE ALLEGED ASSAULT, THE
EYEWITNESS APPARENTLY AGAIN HAS
GONE ON RECORD SAYING IT NEVER
HAPPENED.
HER BEST FRIEND SAYS SHE HAS NO
RECOLLECTION OF EVER BEING AT
ANY PARTY OR SOMETHING LIKE THIS
HAPPENED OR WAS EVER TOLD ABOUT
IT OR EVER MET OR KNEW JUDGE
KAVANAUGH.
IF YOU BREAK IT DOWN, WITH EACH
CASE, THIS IS PIVOTAL.
WE ARE NOT A COUNTRY -- WITH
COTTON THINGS WRONG IN THE
MEDIA.
A LOT OF OUR COLLEAGUES -- I WAS
RIGHT ABOUT RICHARD JEWELL,
LOCALHOST IN ATLANTA AT THE
TIME.
AND HE THANKED ME FOR NOT
RUSHING TO JUDGMENT.
WITH THE DUKE LACROSSE, UVA,
FERGUSON, MISSOURI.
CAMBRIDGE POLICE.
BALTIMORE, MARYLAND, TRAVE ON
MARTIN, EVERYBODY RUSHES TO
JUDGMENT.
IF THEY THINK THEY KNOW HOW
THESE THINGS ARE GOING TO WORK
OUT.
THERE'S BEEN A FULL -- NOW SEVEN
INVESTIGATIONS INTO KAVANAUGH.
HE HAS MADE A PASSIONATE DEFENSE
OF HIS POSITION AND WITHOUT ANY
CORROBORATION THIS MAN BELONGS
IN THE COURT AND THE RISK IS IF
THE REPUBLICANS NOW MOVE THE
BAR, CHANGE WITH THE STANDARD
IS, NOW IT BECOMES ABOUT
TEMPERAMENT, NOT ABOUT THE FBI
REPORT.
WHAT THEY HAVE DONE IS THEY HAVE
NOW OPENED THE DOOR THAT EVERY
SINGLE PERSON EVER BROUGHT IN TO
ANY IMPORTANT OFFICE IS GOING TO
BE SUBJECT TO THE SAME LIES,
SMEARS, THIS MARKSMAN, THE
CHARACTER ASSASSINATION AND
FRANKLY THE BLUDGEONING OF THEIR
FAMILY.
>> Shannon: HAS GOING TO
HAPPEN ON BOTH SIDES OF THE
AISLE.
>> IT WILL GO BOTH WAYS.
>> Shannon: AS A WOMAN AND AS
AN ATTORNEY I DO THINK IT'S VERY
IMPORTANT THAT PEOPLE COME
FORWARD WITH THESE ACCUSATIONS
BUT THEN THAT WE DO HAVE DUE
PROCESS.
>> AS A FATHER OF A DAUGHTER,
SOMEBODY WHO HAS THREE SISTERS,
LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING, I WAS
GLAD THE REPUBLICANS TOOK THIS
SERIOUSLY.
THEY DID THE RIGHT THING, BUT
THE EVIDENCE DIDN'T CORROBORATE
IT.
AT THAT POINT WE ARE A COUNTRY
THAT BELIEVES IN DUPE PROCESS
AND PRESUMPTION OF INNOCENCE AND
IF IT DOESN'T END UP THAT WAY WE
WILL HAVE GONE BACKWARDS IN WAYS
THAT I THINK WILL BE
UNPREDICTABLE AT THIS HOUR.
