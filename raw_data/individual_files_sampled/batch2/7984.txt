POLICE HAVE RELEASED THE DASH CAM FOOTAGE FROM THE SHOOTING OF PHILANDO CASTILE. PHILANDO CASTILE WAS SHOT BY THE POLICE OFFICER, YANEZ. HE WAS THE INDIVIDUAL WHO TOLD YANEZ THAT HE HAD A GUN IN THE CAR, AND OF COURSE THAT LED TO A SHOOTING, AND THE POLICE OFFICER WHO WAS INVOLVED IN THE SHOOTING WAS PHYSICALLY FOUND NOT GUILTY BY A JURY, AND SO IT HAS BEEN A BIG STORY, BUT ONE THING WE HAVE NEVER SEEN IS THAT ñ CAM FOOTAGE; WHAT REALLY HAPPENED? IT SEEMED TO BE A LITTLE BIT OF HE SAID, SHE SAID SITUATION ñ OR HE SAID, HE SAID SITUATION IN THIS SITUATION, BUT NOW WITH THE VIDEO WE HAVE A CLEAR IDEA OF HOW THE SHOOTING WENT DOWN. I WANT TO WARN YOU GUYS THAT IT IS DIFFICULT TO WATCH, IT IS GRAPHIC, BUT WITH THAT SAID, I THINK IT IS IMPORTANT FOR YOU TO SEE EVERYTHING THAT IS OUT THERE REGARDING THIS CASE, AND THEN MAKE YOUR OWN DECISION AS TO WHAT YOU THINK. TAKE A LOOK. SIR, I HAVE TO TELL YOU, I DO HAVE A FIREARM ON ME. DON'T REACH FOR IT. DON'T PULL IT OUT. DON'T PULL IT OUT! OH MY GOD, YOU JUST KILLED MY BOYFRIEND. DON'T PULL IT OUT! DON'T MOVE! FUCK! FUCK! FUCK! FUCK! OH MY GOD! OH MY GOD! DON'T MOVE! DON'T MOVE! OH MY GOD! OH MY GOD I'M SHAKING. DON'T MOVE! DON'T MOVE BABY. DON'T MOVE BABE, PLEASE. OKAY, SO, HERE'S WHAT THE VIDEO CLARIFIED FOR ME; I WAS UNDER THE ASSUMPTION, AND BASED ON HOW THIS STORY WAS REPORTED, MULTIPLE TIMES, THAT HE WAS ASKED FOR HIS ID, AND THAT'S WHEN HE WAS REACHING FOR HIS ID, AND GOT SHOT THEN, BUT HE HAD ACTUALLY GIVEN THE DOCUMENTATION TO THE COP BEFORE THE SHOOTING HAPPENED. SO, HE GIVES THE DOCUMENTATION TO THE COP, AND THEN CALMLY SAYS ñ WHICH SEE IN THE VIDEO ñ I HAVE TO KNOW ñ I HAVE LET YOU KNOW, I HAVE A FIREARM, AND HE SAYS DON'T REACH FOR IT, AND I DON'T KNOW IF YOU HEARD IT, BUT AT THAT POINT HE SAYS SOMETHING ALONG THE LINES OF, I'M NOT REACHING FOR IT, AND THEN IMMEDIATELY THE SHOOTING HAPPENS. YOU DON'T SEE WHAT IS HAPPENING IN THE CAR, OBVIOUSLY, I JUST WANT PEOPLE TO SEE WHAT HAPPENED. MY UNDERSTANDING, FROM READING THE TRIAL, IS THAT HE HANDED OVER THE PROOF OF INSURANCE, AND HAD NOT YET HANDED OVER ID. OH, I SEE. HE HAD ALREADY HANDED OVER PROOF OF INSURANCE ñ I'M NOT, I MEAN, COPS, IT'S A DANGEROUS ROB, BUT THEY HAD ALREADY BEGUN THE PEACEFUL EXCHANGE OF INFORMATION WHEN YOU GET PULLED OVER BY A COP. HE HANDED OVER HIS PROOF OF INSURANCE, AND THEN I'M GUESSING NOW, HAD TO REACH FOR HIS ID, WHAT HE THOUGHT, I'M GOING TO TELL YOU THAT THERE IS A GUN IN THE CAR. THE BOTTOM LINE IS THE SAME THING WHEN THE VERDICT CAME OUT ON THURSDAY, HE JUST, HE DID EVERYTHING HE WAS SUPPOSED TO DO. I MEAN, WHEN YOU HEAR ABOUT BLACK MOTHERS, AND BLACK FATHERS, TELLING THEIR KIDS HOW TO BEHAVE, YOU KNOW, IDA RODRIGUEZ SAYS IT, SHE SCARED EVERY TIME HE GOES OUT, I'M POINTING AT YOU KIM BECAUSE SHE WAS SITTING IN THAT SEAT ON FRIDAY, SHE IS SCARED EVERY TIME, AND GIVES VERY SPECIFIC INSTRUCTIONS OF WHAT HER KIDS ARE SUPPOSED TO DO. SO, HE DID EVERYTHING RIGHT, AND THEN THOUGHT, I SHOULD MENTION ñ IF ONLY ñ THERE'S NOTHING FUNNY ABOUT IT, IF PHILANDO CASTILLE HAD NEVER SAID HE HAD A GUN IN THE CAR, AND JUST GOT HIS ID OUT, HE WOULD STILL BE ALIVE TODAY, BUT HE THOUGHT THAT WAS THE RIGHT THING TO DO, BECAUSE MAYBE THE ID WAS WHERE THE GUN WAS. HOWEVER, IT COMES OUT. HE DID EVERYTHING HE WAS SUPPOSED TO DO, EVERYTHING HE IS SUPPOSED TO DO AND HE STILL ENDED UP GETTING KILLED. WHY IS THAT THE FIRST MOVE? TO JUST START SHOOTING. ISN'T THERE ANOTHER METHOD YOU COULD HAVE USED? IS THERE ONE OF SEVERAL OTHER METHODS YOU COULD'VE USED? YEAH, SO, THAT IS A COMMON THEME THAT WOULD SEE WITH A LOT OF THESE ñ THAT WE SEE WITH A LOT OF THESE STORIES, WHERE COPS SEEM TO HAVE NONLETHAL WEAPONS AT THEIR DISPOSAL, AND FOR SOME REASON THEY DON'T IMMEDIATELY GO TO THOSE WEAPONS; THEY IMMEDIATELY GO TO GUNS, WHICH IS INTERESTING, BECAUSE, AGAIN, AND IF SO THIS MULTIPLE TIMES BEFORE, IN THE PAST THE BIG STORY WAS THAT COPS WERE OVERUSING TASERS, AND USING IT ON INDIVIDUALS WHO HAD HEART CONDITIONS. AT EVEN THOUGH THEY WERE NONLETHAL, SOME PEOPLE WOULD DIE FROM TASERS, THAT WAS THE BIG STORY WE HAD MAYBE FIVE YEARS AGO. AND NOW, BECAUSE ñ MAYBE BECAUSE OF ALL THE TRANSPARENCY WE HAVE WITH CELL PHONE VIDEOS, AND LIVE SOCIAL MEDIA VIDEOS, WE HAVE AN UNDERSTANDING OF HOW LETHAL WEAPONS ARE NOW USED. AND IT ALL HAPPENED TOO QUICKLY. HE CALMLY TELLS THE COP, I HAVE TO TELL YOU, I HAVE A LICENSED GUN IN THE CAR. AND AGAIN, WE DID NOT SHOW YOU THE FULL VIDEO BECAUSE WE DID NOT HAVE TIME, BUT YOU SHOULD WATCH THE FULL VIDEO, BECAUSE THEIR INTERACTION BEFORE THE SHOOTING WAS TOTALLY FINE. WAS,. IT HAPPENED SO QUICKLY, ALMOST OUT OF NOWHERE. IT'S BECAUSE THE COP THOUGHT ñ ONE OF THE REASONS THE ESCALATION HAPPENED, WHY THE COUPLEDOM OVER WAS BECAUSE HE THOUGHT HE LOOKED LIKE A SUSPECT IN A ROBBERY THAT HAD HAPPENED NEARBY. I STILL WANT TO SEE A SIDE-BY-SIDE, IF THEY EVER CAUGHT THAT GUY, BECAUSE I THAT HE DOESN'T LOOK LIKE PHILANDO CASTILLE, BUT HE WAS BLACK AND YOUNG AND SITTING IN A CAR. HOW YOU RECONCILE THAT THE SUSPECT YOU THOUGHT WAS IN A CAR WITH A WIFE AND CHILD. AGAIN, IT'S A SLIGHT EVIDENCE OF WHAT HUMANS DO WHEN THEY ARE SHOOTING, THEY RUN AWAY. SO, YOU KNOW, I'M NOT BLACK, SO, I DON'T HAVE STANDING HERE, BUT I AM HUMAN, AND I DID SEE ñ YOU SEE THE REACTION OF THE COP, THE COP STARTED TO CRY IN THE MIDDLE OF THAT, AND, THAT COP DIDN'T WANT TO SHOOT HIM, RIGHT? HE DID NOT WANT TO SHOOT HIM, AND IKE I OBVIOUSLY DIDN'T WANT TO GET SHOT; NOBODY WANTED THAT TO HAPPEN. SO, THE CONVICTION ñ WHICH I UNDERSTAND MEANS A LOT TO A LOT OF PEOPLE, AND UNDERSTANDABLY ñ I UNDERSTAND WHY HE WASN'T CONVICTED, I LOVE HOW THE PROSECUTOR TOOK THE CASE, AND MADE THE CASE THAT NO REASONABLE PERSON UNDER THOSE CIRCUMSTANCES WOULD HAVE DISCHARGED THEIR WEAPON. THE DEFENSE, IT'S NOT THAT HARD TO DEFEND A COP WHO USES THE WEAPON AND SAYS THAT THEY FEARED FOR THEIR LIFE, BECAUSE THE LAW IS WRITTEN IN SUCH A WAY THAT IT IS A PRETTY EASY DEFENSE. THAT COP FEARED FOR HIS LIFE. THE PROBLEM IS, HOW DO WE CHANGE THAT THAT COP FEARED FOR HIS LIFE? HOW DO WE MAKE IT SO THAT INTERACTION ñ THE REASON HE CAN'T GO IN WITH A TASER IS BECAUSE HE THOUGHT HE WAS PULLING OVER A ROBBERY SUSPECT, SO YOU GO IN WITH A TASER. BUT HOW DO WE CHANGE THOSE INTERACTIONS THAT HE'S NOT TERRIFIED GOING IN? ANSWER HE'S NOT SO QUICK, AND IF YOU CHANGE THE LAW, AND IT BECOMES EASIER TO CONVICT POLICE OFFICERS, SOME COPS ARE GOING TO QUIT. THEY ARE GOING TO LEAVE THE FORCE. THEY ARE ONE TO THINK, THIS JOB IS TOO DANGEROUS FOR ME TO HAVE MY HANDS TIED, AND I UNDERSTAND THAT. BUT IF WE ARE GOING TO GIVE PEOPLE GUNS, IN THE NAME OF THE STATE, AND ALLOW THEM TO USE IT, WE HAVE GOT TO HAVE INCREDIBLY TIGHT CONTROLS OVER THE USE OF THOSE WEAPONS. TO ME, LEAVING OUTLAW, LEAVING OUT JUST INSTINCTIVE HUMAN REACTION, I THINK THAT GUY LOST HIS HEAD TOO QUICKLY. NO QUESTION, A LOT OF OTHER WAYS TO GO THERE, BUT HE LOST IT, AND IT'S ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO CONVICT A COP OF THAT. SO, THE LAW NEEDS TO BE CHANGED, THE TRAINING NEEDS TO BE CHANGED, THAT WHOLE INTERACTION IS TO START FROM A DIFFERENT PLACE, AND THEN, ONLY THEN DO I THINK WE SEE A REDUCTION IN THESE OFFICER INVOLVED CASES. I THINK YOU MAKE A REALLY GOOD POINT THERE, AND ONE THING I WANT TO ADD IS, YES, THE ONUS IS ON POLICE DEPARTMENTS THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY, BUT I ALSO, I WANT TO ADDRESS SOMETHING ELSE THAT KEEPS COMING UP WITH THESE STORIES THAT I THINK IS PROBLEMATIC, AND IT IS SOCIETY'S REACTION TO IT, AND THIS COMFORT THAT PEOPLE HAVE WITH DEMONIZING INNOCENT INDIVIDUALS WHO HAVE BEEN SHOT AND KILLED BY COPS. AND SO, SOMETHING ANDERSON CAME ACROSS ON SOCIAL MEDIA YESTERDAY THAT I WANTED TO JUST QUICKLY DRAW ATTENTION TO; THERE WAS A BLACK ACTIVIST WHO POSTED SOMETHING ABOUT OTTO WARMBIER, THE 22-YEAR-OLD WHO WAS DETAINED IN NORTH KOREA. HE WAS SENT BACK, AND HE WAS SUFFERING FROM A COMA WHEN HE WAS SENT BACK, AND UNFORTUNATELY, TRAGICALLY HE WAS PRODUCTIVE DEAD YESTERDAY. THE BLACK ACTIVIST WROTE SOMETHING YESTERDAY ABOUT HOW, HE SHOULDN'T HAVE DONE ANYTHING CRIMINAL IN NORTH KOREA, TAKING DOWN THAT BANNER WAS CRIMINAL ACTIVITY. SO, ESSENTIALLY ANTAGONIZING WARMBIER FOR HIS ACTIONS IN NORTH KOREA, BUT IT WASN'T MEANT TO BE IT WAS MEANT TO DRAW SIMILARITIES TO REACTIONS WHEN WHITE PEOPLE ARE MURDERED VERSUS WHEN BLACK PEOPLE ARE MURDERED. WHEN BLACK PEOPLE ARE MURDERED, IT SEEMS LIKE WHAT PEOPLE HAVE NO PROBLEM TEARING THEM APART, DEMONIZING THEM, ASSUMING THEY ARE THUGS, TALKING ABOUT HOW MUCH MARIJUANA THEY HAVE IN THEIR SYSTEM ñ BY THE WAY, GUESS WHO SMOKES MARIJUANA? PRE-MUCH EVERYONE. THAT DOESN'T GIVE COPS THE AUTHORITY TO RUN AROUND SHOOTING PEOPLE BECAUSE THEY MIGHT HAVE MARIJUANA IN THEIR SYSTEM. BUT WE HAVE NO PROBLEM DEMONIZING PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN SHOT AND KILLED, BUT IF SUMMARY POST SOMETHING ABOUT OTTO WARMBIER, WHO WAS A 22-YEAR-OLD WHITE GUY ñ WHO, BY THE WAY, SHOULD NEVER HAVE BEEN MURDERED, AND THAT WAS TRAGIC ñ BUT IF PEOPLE SAY THE SAME THING ABOUT OTTO, PEOPLE ARE UP IN ARMS ABOUT IT. I DIDN'T GET THAT GUYS POINT AT ALL, I READ IT AND ASSUMED, YOU GOT YOURSELF IN TROUBLE FOR THAT, BUT I DIDN'T GET THAT, SO I'M GLAD YOU POINTED IT OUT. WE DO IT ALL THE TIME, WE DID IT WITH MIKE BROWN, BUT HERE'S THE DEAL; GOOD LUCK DOING IT WITH PHILANDO CASTILLE. HE DID EVERYTHING RIGHT, EVERY GOD DAMN THING RIGHT. HE LET THE POLICE KNOW THAT THERE WAS A GOT IN THE CAR, THAT HE WAS LEGALLY ALLOWED TO CARRY. THIS WAS A GUY ñ AND, BY THE WAY, PHILANDO CASTILLE, I THINK THIS WAS RIGHT, I READ IT ON SOCIAL MEDIA, I READ IT AT THE TIME OF THE SHOOTING, HE WAS A PROFESSIONAL GET STOPPED BY POLICE GUY. THE NUMBER I HAVE IN MY HEAD IS TIMES THAT HE HAD BEEN PULLED OVER BY POLICE. 46 TIMES. EITHER HE'S THE WORST DRIVER IN HISTORY OF MINNESOTA, OR HE GETS PULLED OVER A LOT BECAUSE HE'S BLACK. SO HE KNEW HOW TO GET PULLED OVER, HE'S CAREFUL; HIS GIRLFRIEND'S FOUR-YEAR-OLD KID WAS IN THE CAR. HE HANDED OVER THE INSURANCE, HE DIDN'T HAVE A LICENSE RIGHT AWAY, HE WON THE COP AND DAMMIT THE GUY STILL GOT IT. IT'S HORRIBLE, IT'S HIDEOUS. SO, IT'S NOT ABOUT THE CONVICTION FOR ME, BUT I DON'T HAVE THE STANDING, AND I GET IT, YOU ARE ñ YOU HAVE EVERY RIGHT TO BE OUTRAGED. BUT THE POINT IS, TO ME, WE HAVE GOT TO CHANGE THE SYSTEM AND THE LAW, IMMEDIATELY, RIGHT NOW, SO THAT THERE ARE 10 OF THESE YEARS AND NOT 900 OF THEM A YEAR. IT IS MORE THAN THAT, THOUGH. LIKE ANA SAID, THAT IS SO WELL-INTENTIONED AND RIGHT TO DO, BUT IF WE AS A SOCIETY ARE SO QUICK TO LOOK AT PEOPLE AND GO, THEY ARE BAD, THEY ARE CRIMINALS, THAT'S MORE THAN US. WHEN WE LOOK AT BLACK LIVES MATTER AND PEOPLE GO, THAT'S A HATE GROUP, THEY ARE TERRIBLE. ALL THEY ARE SAYING IS, WE ARE HUMAN, STOP KILLING US, WE BLEED, WE ARE JUST LIKE YOU, STOP ATTENDING WE DON'T MATTER.
