but Rachel Mitchell wrote a letter that we all got ahold of last night talking about how dr. Ford despite the feelings that so many feel for her testimony but dr. Ford said that evidence doesn't support claims against Cavanaugh and and let me ask you about that because those that I did speak to this weekend that questioned dr. Ford's testimony just kept going back to the same thing that probably prosecutors would go back to which is you know that everybody that she mentioned at the scene said it didn't happen and it wasn't just because they were intimidated by Brett Kavanaugh even her longtime friend who she claims was there whether said she wasn't there with her that's certainly something that that Rachel Mitchell seized on I'm curious what you thought about Rachel Mitchell's conclusion and what you think as a prosecutor generally about dr. Ford's story three four days after the testimony yeah the issue isn't so much Rachel Mitchell's conclusion as it is to the question and the premise there is either a an unintentional or a deliberate effort to frame this as a criminal prosecution when in fact it is not it is much more akin to a job interview in a criminal prosecution the standard is guilty beyond a reasonable doubt and a presumption of innocence and and by that standard she's right you could not prove a case here others have said you couldn't get a warrant because there's no probable cause here that may be true but that's not the issue the issue is is this the person that you want to put on our US Supreme Court if these allegations had come up earlier before he had been nominated I am certain he never would have been nominated because you would say even if this isn't true if it's just a credible allegation we don't need that distraction we've got this long list of potential candidates let's write one of them on the court instead we're locked in this spot where regardless of what happens if he's on ER he's off there's gonna be these bad feelings as you talked about but I think if he's on it could whisper to the court you talk about brick Cavanaugh being too big to fail I think my the counterpoint to that is the court is too big to ruin and so there's a lot of conservative judges who take his place right you just said though even if this is not true but that's what we're trying to get to the bottom of even if this is not and I agree with you I I actually think that if you just look at that moment where he was with senator Klobuchar and the the poor temperament that he showed there there were a couple other moments too where it does not seem that he was being honest and straightforward about some some very simple some very basic things about getting into Yale and not having any connections there and he some of the terms that he tried to tried to put different meanings to yep some some real concerns are raised there but the FBI is trying to get as much information about what happened and what did not happen it doesn't matter doesn't it a great deal about whether anybody can figure out whether this happened or not well if we are going to persist in the nomination of red Cavanaugh not withdraw his name for these other reasons including those that you mentioned then yes I guess it does matter I think if the Senate is going to make a decision and I think a big part of it is you know millions of women are watching and saying if this is true does it matter and so figuring out whether it's true is the first step in that it's concerning it that is frank says the FBI is he is feeling handcuffed in this instance one would hope that even if they've been given an initial list of witnesses that they'd be permitted to go back and get permission to follow any leads that may emerge from there I mean if they talk to the people were present at the scene and say you know who else was present at the scene is is person X that they'd be permitted to talk to person X that's a very important thing so I am hopeful that that list of four or whatever it is is only an initial list and that they'd be permitted to conduct any necessary follow-up investigation that they have to ordinarily the FBI isn't told who you get to talk to they're given a topic and and they're permitted to have free rein to decide who they need to talk to to feel that they have fully investigated that topic so Holly why can you tell about the president's attitude towards this FBI investigation obviously this weekend when Democrats were complaining he tweeted out that he wanted the FBI to do whatever the FBI wanted to follow whatever leads who wanted to follow that also Sarah Sanders I believe repeated that claim other administration officials did but then we heard senior administration officials saying that in fact it is more limited what can you tell us what insights can you give us about what the truth is so here's where I think we are this morning Joe the president you're right and his administration his white house is saying hey free rein that seems to be the word of the day let the FBI do whatever they want now the president has tweeted that he has said it out loud but that has not apparently trickled down to the rest of the folks who are actually looking into this a senior US official and another source is telling NBC News that the FBI has not received any kind of updated instructive instructions rather from the White House so at this point there are still questions about what this limited scope means and that's why Senator Dianne Feinstein has written this letter to DOM and the White House Counsel to FBI director Christopher ray saying we need more information I want a copy of what exactly you are supposed to be doing and what you think your mission is so that we know as well Barbara said something that struck me as well she said if this Cavanaugh a nomination moves forward let me tell you this Joe based on my reporting there is no if in the mind of the president there is no if in the eyes of the White House there is not a back-up plan here multiple sources have told me over the last four days or so that it's not like the president is sitting around going right let's toss around some names to could some backups to be that those conversations really have not happened now that said remember he just fairly recently this summer nominated Brett Kavanaugh and went through the interview process with other candidates so it's not like it's stale in his mind it's still fairly fresh but it is notable that you do not have the White House Counsel done McGann you don't have the folks who are involved in the judiciary sitting there coming up with names as a backup they are all in on Brendan Kavanagh all of their eggs are in the Kavanagh basket they think this thing's going forward and and he's gonna end up on the court alright Hallie Jackson thank you so much we greatly appreciate you being here and John Heilemann I first of all if you're in the position of Donald Trump or the position of somebody in the White House what do you say there is no backup plan for arts that puts more that puts more pressure on Susan Collins that puts more pressure on where Kowski that puts more pressure on every Republican flake that's wavering to basically say listen here's the deal we can have a conservative court if you pick Kavanagh but if you don't pick Kavanagh we're gonna be tied four to four until after the 2020 elections so I don't I I that's a very compelling argument I don't believe it for a second what about you well look I it's not clear that there's time at least between now and the midterms for there to be there was another possibility right there you could put another name up but right now it seems to me in addition to the point you're making Joe which is that of course you say there's no backup on top of that I think the White House is starting to recognize that the politics of this are playing to its favor that if judge Kavanagh were to go down the much of the Republican base if you believe that this is a base mobilization election that the only hope the Republicans have is to motivate the Trump base to turn out in large numbers there right now judge Cavanaugh and what they perceive as his unfair treatment in this process is a motivating factor the court helped right Donald Trump in 2016 the campaign for the court and the court could help him again in this context so in some sense the the politics of this whether judge Kavanagh gets confirmed or not sticking with judge Kavanagh is an important base motivate motivation strategy but I want to come back to the question I'm gonna ask you but I also really want to hear from Frankfort glue see and from Barbara about this the the fundamental question still about this FBI investigation which is not to my mind been satisfied forget about even the questions you guys have raised great questions about the scope of what the FBI is allowed to do if they're investigating questions of sexual misconduct here's another question is perjury an issue that the FBI is allowed to be investigating there are many people who look at judge Cavanaugh and his testimony last week and say he looks like he lied about a wide variety of things under oath under oath in front of this committee so is the FBI now allowed to investigate Liz can I get with some of those things well sir what you just said he committed perjury list him well certainly there are many people who think that he lied about you mention a large number you said there are a lot of small things certainly the question of his of the question of his drinking for instance he has made many assertions that there are what there are witnesses now including his roommates at Yale and other places who've said that he was in fact a blackout drunk in college the things that he claimed in front of the committee when he was in in in colloquy with for example senator Klobuchar that he denied outright about his he said the admitted he liked beer and he said that he occasionally drank too much but he said that he tried to circumscribed that and say that his he was no kind basically your average beer drinking guy he's drinking all right he made pretty for some pretty strong claims there that have been contradicted by people who are named people all on the record right number one we got number one go to number two what else do you think he perjured himself oh I don't have the list here I'll do like I'd be happy to make one for you for a later block but I think there are there are questions that have been raised even earlier in the in the confirmation hearings Joe about for example his work at the White House Democrats have made an issue about that in the early phases of the confirmation hearing about whether or not he had been truthful about various activities that he undertook when he was in the White House on various legal and political matters they were already concerned about perjury even before we got to the questions of sexual misconduct so I do think there are people on the Democratic side who believed that the judge on matters large and small has demonstrated a looseness with the truth and so the question to me is that an issue for the FBI or not let's take it to Frank and I'm only trying to move this along because alex is screaming in my ear yeah move it along idiot is what Frank my EP is saying so so Frank I got to ask you a question but well first of all perjury is that something that the FBI would look into so the answer is yes but only if the victim of that perjury the Congress right the charge will be lying to Congress they need to be the complainant they need to say we want you looking into this and I'm telling you Joe the FBI has not been asked to do that all right Frank one other quick question and maybe this is just just a failure of character on my part but I usually if if the president a night if I'm an FBI agent and the president United States says I'm given free rein they can investigate whatever they want to I'm gonna blow through the doors I'm gonna do whatever I want to do I'm going to question whoever I want to question I'm going to push I'm going to go over every line that's out there and then when I'm called the task who say but wait the president United States said this this this and this are there some FBI agents that may do that no here's what I'm hearing is quite the opposite which is that they have written orders that are about you know an inch long and the they don't take orders by tweet they don't take orders by press conference they have written orders from the White House so what the president is saying to the American public is quite different than what the White House is providing in writing to the FBI all right so Barbara let's get really specific here if you could guide the FBI agents that are investigating these incidents and Brett Kavanaugh is testimony dr. Ford's testimony what is the one area what is the weak point of Brett Cavanaugh's case where would you where would you point FBI officials and say I really want you to narrow in in this area and push hard the first place I would look would be to talk to mark judge he is the person that dr. Ford puts in the room I would want to know what he has to say and lock him into that story but to Frank's point what's so important is to not just talk to him but then to talk to leads who else did he talk to about this incident who else was there you know there's talk about a former girlfriend did he make statements to anyone else about this in the past month has he talked to Brett Kavanaugh or others about what his story would be if question for the FBI the FBI so I would push there but what's important is you don't just talk to him you talk to those around him to find out if what he's telling you is truthful all right thank you so much Barbara thank you Frank we greatly appreciate you being with us since thanks for checking out MSNBC on YouTube and make sure you subscribe to stay up-to-date on the day's biggest stories and you can click on any of the videos around us to watch more for morning Joe and MSNBC thanks so much for watching
