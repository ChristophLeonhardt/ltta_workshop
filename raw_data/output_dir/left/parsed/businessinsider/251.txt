the way I look at especially for
football
they're putting their bodies and
livelihoods on the line just like we are
at the professional level and just to
say that you know college education is
enough when the universities are making
so much money off the athletes they're
selling your likeness selling your
jerseys bobbleheads whatever else
blankets whatever else they can sell you
know while you're there for those three
or four years you know the kids deserve
more they should they should be given so
they should least be compensated I don't
know what the number is but it should be
something
