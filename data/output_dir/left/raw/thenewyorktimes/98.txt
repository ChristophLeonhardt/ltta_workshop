Hi.

2
00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:01,750
I’m Susanna Fogel.

3
00:00:01,750 --> 00:00:04,660
And I am the director and
co-writer of ‘The Spy Who

4
00:00:04,660 --> 00:00:06,204
Dumped Me.'

5
00:00:06,204 --> 00:00:07,505
“Oh my god, I killed someone!

6
00:00:07,505 --> 00:00:08,390
I killed someone!"

7
00:00:08,390 --> 00:00:10,960
O.K., Mila Kunis and
Kate McKinnon on the run,

8
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:13,552
not equipped for the spy caper
they’ve found themselves in.

9
00:00:13,552 --> 00:00:14,260
And here they go.

10
00:00:14,260 --> 00:00:15,590
They see a car.

11
00:00:15,590 --> 00:00:18,280
Now this car was rigged
on a push-pull system.

12
00:00:18,280 --> 00:00:19,930
And they jump in.

13
00:00:19,930 --> 00:00:21,250
The car’s in neutral.

14
00:00:21,250 --> 00:00:24,265
It’s got these intense,
heavy cables rigged up to it

15
00:00:24,265 --> 00:00:26,440
so we could try to make it
go as slowly as possible

16
00:00:26,440 --> 00:00:29,590
for comic effect, which is
harder than you’d think.

17
00:00:29,590 --> 00:00:32,380
And especially hard was having
it go slowly enough that

18
00:00:32,380 --> 00:00:36,695
people could walk alongside
it and yet with enough impact

19
00:00:36,695 --> 00:00:38,590
that it could knock
over this magazine rack,

20
00:00:38,590 --> 00:00:40,120
which we found it
really couldn’t.

21
00:00:40,120 --> 00:00:42,490
So we had to attach a
separate cable to that rack

22
00:00:42,490 --> 00:00:45,882
and have this sort of opposing
push-pull pulley elaborate

23
00:00:45,882 --> 00:00:48,340
system, all of which went into
the making of this extremely

24
00:00:48,340 --> 00:00:00,000
short, low-octane scene.
