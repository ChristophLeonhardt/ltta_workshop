well it's important to talk about all the various White House officials and politicians who have released statements to you no mention this day I think it's important to also talk about how much us how much we as US taxpayers have spent on wars that have been justified by those very politicians after the events of 9/11 so just to give you an idea of something that we have spent trillions of dollars on while simultaneously arguing that we can't provide health care education for our citizens the US has spent 1.5 trillion dollars on various Wars after 9/11 okay so wars in Afghanistan Iraq and Syria have cost US taxpayers more than 1.5 trillion and that's again since September 11th 2001 so I'm gonna give you a breakdown of that spending in just a minute okay so let's just note our priorities as a country first of all we got attacked on 9/11 I still remember that day and we lost nearly 3,000 people it was incredibly traumatic and it was as direct and attack as on our soil as we have ever had so did we want to chase down the guys who did it absolutely if you don't know the story New York Times had an excellent report a couple of years later about how we actually had bin Laden cornered in Afghanistan and that was before our invasion of Iraq but Rumsfeld would not send a general to go get him and that is maddening and the trillions of dollars we have lost since then but were we right to go after Osama bin Laden yes I think we were so would we have spent some money doing that yes we would have okay but one and a half trillion dollars we've been in Afghanistan 17 years we went to Iraq made a mess of it or were like oh we're gonna go get al Qaeda okay now we have Isis that's even worse they just did several attacks inside Afghanistan as we speak 17 years later so what what do we get in return finally a dead bin Laden many many many years later having almost nothing to do with the wars that we executed we got a giant mess in the Middle East that cost hundreds of thousands of innocent civilian lives cost more than 5,000 of our American servicemembers lives 50 thousand that were maimed and injured what could we have done instead with the one and a half trillion dollars so there's a thousand things we could have done but let me just talk about two real quick one is health care can you imagine if we spent the 1 and a half trillion in health care how many more lives we would have saved let alone the lives that were lost by these wars so that is just when you say look I haven't seen a calculation of it but my guess is you spend a one and a half trillion dollars in health care you would have seen hundreds of thousands of American lives instead people this what really struck me I was doing an interview with a guest that progressive gifts from New York recently on rebel headquarters and he's pushing for single-payer in in the state of New York and he made a great point I don't know why I never thought about it this way he said some of my constituents if their kids get cancer and they didn't have insurance and remember about 15% of our country doesn't have insurance kids dead that's it you don't have any money you can't afford cancer shoot you can't take them to the emergency room your kid dies we could have saved their lives if we hadn't spend this one and a half trillion dollars on these wars and then finally you know we can get rid of every student loan in the country not college for all that's a much easier and and way less expensive I'm talking about all the student debt that exists in the country all wiped out in a second and with student loan debt is at one point four trillion dollars so and by the way we could have taken that hundred billion dollars that easily killed bin Laden and taken out al Qaeda from Afghanistan and no one in the country would have student dead how amazing miraculous would that be instead we cost all those lives and made the Middle East so much more unstable I mean doesn't it make the American people angry that our taxpayer money can't be you used to help benefit our lives enriched our lives improve our lives you know that money is easily spent the one piece of legislation that easily gets approved okay by both Congress and the White House is the you know the defense now the National Defense Authorization Act okay there's never any debate about it you just increase the amount of money you want to spend on our military on the defense budget there's never any debate so remember after 9/11 happened one of the wars that we started in in 2003 was the pre-emptive war in Iraq and the Bush administration purposely made it seem as though Iraq was behind 9/11 when it was not so one more thing about this 1.5 trillion is very likely an understatement because most of these calculations do not include the cost of health care for veterans going forward well we wouldn't have so would they need health care we're all of course they would but did they need extra health care because of PTSD traumatic injuries the disabled veterans yes when you add that on top of it then he gets closer to two trillion dollars and what did we solve with it there was just a bombing on last Wednesday in Afghanistan killed 20 people one of our soldiers just got killed and another one wounded this Monday so as in yesterday we're still losing soldiers in Afghanistan for what al Qaeda hasn't been there bin Laden hasn't been there in 17 years they left immediately they ran and in fact if we were competent we would have we had him cornered in Tora Bora and they did you know this again go back and read that story from the New York Times it's an amazing story that they wrote the al Qaeda led by bin Laden did their last prayers because they thought well they've got us cornered and we let him go oh my god it's maddening and meanwhile Rumsfeld said inside the administration back then well Afghanistan is not a target-rich environment Iraq is a target-rich environment look at that verbiage in other words our defense contractors can make a lot more money if we bomb Iraq there's not enough things to in Afghanistan and and at that now Isis is the one that did that attack last week Isis is in alakay is in Afghanistan it didn't even exist before we invaded Iraq it's even worse than al-qaeda and and now we say no we're gonna spend more money to make sure we can now defeat Isis oh for God's sake you know we have 14,000 troops left in Afghanistan or 14,000 Americans overall what are we doing is what is it gonna take 18 years 19 years to accomplish what I bet if you asked Trump or anyone else in the administration what are you trying to accomplish in Afghanistan they couldn't possibly answer you defense secretary Jim mattis I gave a short speech today to commemorate 9/11 and he did touch on you know our actions abroad and I thought that this portion of his speech was really interesting especially considering the verbiage so take a listen maniacs disguised and false religious garb thought by hurting us they could scare us that day but we Americans are not made of cotton candy we are not seaweed drifting in the current we are not intimidated by our enemies and mr. president your military does not scare our nation's troops today are worthy successors of our Revolutionary Army at Valley Forge worthy successors of our valiant sailors of Midway and our Marines of blood Iwo Jima and of our Air Force pilots patrolling MIG Valley men and women of your Armed Forces America having signed a blank check to the protection of the American people into the defense of our Constitution a check payable with their very lives your military stand ready and confident to defend this country this experiment in democracy so mattis uses the phrase blank check in reference to our soldiers who risk their lives the blank check meeting their lives when they go to these wars and you know based on what you hear in propaganda you know to protect democracy around the world but that's not what it's really about we all know that but Americans have also signed a blank check because there's no end in sight maddis claims no no don't worry when it comes to Afghanistan we're now opening up talks with the Taliban and we're gonna have some negotiations there and hopefully there will be an end let me give you his exact quote he says we have more indications that reconciliation is no longer just a shimmer out there no longer just a mirage it now has some framework there's some open lines of communication now you must be so proud of 17 years later so look Jim Mad Dog Madison the Trump administration because he is one of the few people who are who is sane in the administration even though his nickname is literally Mad Dog it gives you a sense of how bad the rest of the administration is so I guess within that context I give him credit for being cooler head for example when Trump wanted to make this Syrian war far worse by trying to assassinate Assad mattis apparently according in Woodward's book ignored him and that was the correct decision but don't get don't get any idea in your head that mattis is some sort of good guy or progressive no like many of our generals unfortunately they use the troops as a punchline and as a gimmick so they say support the troops do you really support the troops you've been wasting their lives for 17 years in Afghanistan you know what and they're all we get but we're giving money wait wait no no you're not giving money to the truce you're giving it to Lockheed Martin and Boeing and Raytheon you know what the average service member comes in at their starting salary about $19,000 support the troops for what with what you're not supporting troops remember when our troops are getting blown up in Iraq and Rumsfeld went to Iraq and said and they they had not prepared the one thing they needed which was armored vehicles because they were planting roadside bombs they're like Raytheon made a gorgeous nuclear sub that's sitting there in a dock somewhere that has no relevance to our wars in Iraq and Afghanistan they got paid trillions of dollars for it in that case billions but overall yes we spent trillions on defense card but our guys getting paid $19,000 a year are getting blown up because they didn't actually protect the troops cuz why armored vehicles don't cost that much I'm not talking about tanks in that case I'm talking about the cars that they use to put metal plates underneath them Rieti I can't make as much money from that so who cares and you know what Rumsfeld said he said well you go to the war with the army you have not the one you wish you had after they wasted one and a half trillion dollars on their buddies who are also their donors and by the way so why do I go after the generals in this case the great majority of them retire and immediately work for defense contractors and get absolutely wealthy of those wars they set you and your kids to die for so that's what these generals and the military-industrial complex is about and that's how they wasted our money wasted the lives of our troops and use 9/11 for their own political purposes and it's grotesque
