1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:03,360
Say you've written a list and gone to the
store..

2
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:07,350
But you quickly start buying things that you didn't plan on.

3
00:00:07,350 --> 00:00:09,680
After all, fresh produce would be nice.

4
00:00:09,680 --> 00:00:12,500
And these look good.

5
00:00:12,500 --> 00:00:13,920
Half off?

6
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:15,330
Why not!

7
00:00:15,330 --> 00:00:16,329
Wait.

8
00:00:16,329 --> 00:00:26,560
Why is it so hard to stick to a shopping list?

9
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:30,919
Researchers estimate that half of consumer
spending is unplanned.

10
00:00:30,919 --> 00:00:34,160
Sometimes it's stuff you just forgot to put
on your list.

11
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:37,120
But there's another kind of purchase that
consumer psychologists measure

12
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:42,630
That would be your impulse purchase
where you see something.

13
00:00:42,630 --> 00:00:43,630
 

14
00:00:43,630 --> 00:00:44,630
You think it's kind of a cool item.

15
00:00:44,630 --> 00:00:47,090
I think I'll buy that.

16
00:00:47,090 --> 00:00:51,711
The architecture of a store can impact consumer
satisfaction, which in turn might spur

17
00:00:51,711 --> 00:00:52,711
impulse buys.

18
00:00:52,711 --> 00:00:58,380
In the 20th century, the architect Victor
Gruen used light and space to dramatically

19
00:00:58,380 --> 00:01:01,380
stage goods in storefront windows.

20
00:01:01,380 --> 00:01:06,770
His designs tried to capture the attention
of passersby… and convert them into customers.

21
00:01:06,770 --> 00:01:10,600
Today, people call this technique 'The Gruen
Effect.'

22
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:14,570
It happens when a store environment takes
you from shopping for a specific item

23
00:01:14,570 --> 00:01:20,329
to shopping for shopping's sake.
 
It's about the mindset and the environment

24
00:01:20,329 --> 00:01:21,690
that they try to create.

25
00:01:21,690 --> 00:01:24,364
Does this sound familiar?

26
00:01:24,364 --> 00:01:25,800
Think about your last trip to IKEA.

27
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:33,670
They have the restaurant with the Swedish meatballs and all of this stuff. And that's not a coincidence.

28
00:01:33,670 --> 00:01:34,860
You're trying to build excitement

29
00:01:34,860 --> 00:01:39,800
because when
people are excited and aroused they're more likely to buy.

30
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:42,979
Almost 20 percent of our buying decisions

31
00:01:42,979 --> 00:01:45,130
are based on logic and needs.

32
00:01:45,130 --> 00:01:47,950
80 percent of our buying decisions are actually
based on emotions.

33
00:01:47,950 --> 00:01:50,439
And we try to make that connection or bridge
that connection

34
00:01:50,439 --> 00:01:54,799
Yeah of course we are retailers so we try
to make sure that you know, grab a thing

35
00:01:54,799 --> 00:01:55,899
or two.

36
00:01:55,899 --> 00:02:00,999
My name is Richard La Graauw and I'm creative director
for Ikea here in the US.

37
00:02:00,999 --> 00:02:02,700
Which is an important job.

38
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:05,899
He's in charge of how the products are presented in the store.

39
00:02:05,899 --> 00:02:08,299
That includes layout.

40
00:02:08,299 --> 00:02:12,980
Retailers pay close attention to how their
floor plan can change in-store behavior.

41
00:02:12,980 --> 00:02:17,129
Grid layouts emphasize speed and convenience.

42
00:02:17,129 --> 00:02:21,269
Where freeform layouts allow exploration,
which can make customers visit more parts

43
00:02:21,269 --> 00:02:23,140
of the shop.

44
00:02:23,140 --> 00:02:29,850
And racetrack designs create a loop that exposes customers to a certain path of product.

45
00:02:29,850 --> 00:02:34,000
IKEA uses a fixed path through a maze of product displays.

46
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,650
That can extend the distance travelled in store.

47
00:02:37,650 --> 00:02:41,010
So the more you travel, the more items by definition

48
00:02:41,010 --> 00:02:46,000
as a shopper you'll be exposed to.

49
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:50,060
At the entrance, most customers will be drawn
to a bright yellow bin of bags, placed next

50
00:02:50,060 --> 00:02:51,379
to the escalator.

51
00:02:51,379 --> 00:02:53,840
Spots of light guide your eye to the entrance
of the showroom

52
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:56,599
And before you know it, you're taking the
scenic route.

53
00:02:57,829 --> 00:03:01,600
So with light, you can actually steer consumers towards different
areas and

54
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:03,600
toward different product selections.

55
00:03:03,689 --> 00:03:08,160
On average, customers only visit about a third of any retailer's floor area.

56
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:11,290
IKEA's layout forces customers to cover more ground.

57
00:03:12,700 --> 00:03:17,409
IKEA was always designed as a place where
you can see, touch, and try, no?

58
00:03:17,409 --> 00:03:19,409
So they can spend hours if they want to.

59
00:03:19,409 --> 00:03:23,440
But there's also consumers that know exactly
what they want and just want to have it quick.

60
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:26,019
So it's tailored to both.

61
00:03:26,019 --> 00:03:28,760
One researcher in London surveyed an Ikea

62
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:31,590
to hand-draw these pedestrians pathways.

63
00:03:31,590 --> 00:03:36,120
This heat map of the showroom was generated
using her data.

64
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:42,099
It looks like the path guides are working.

65
00:03:42,099 --> 00:03:43,550
Where Victor Gruen simply used a hunch to invent window shopping,

66
00:03:43,550 --> 00:03:48,170
virtually any store from IKEA to your local
grocery has a trove of big data at their fingertips.

67
00:03:51,170 --> 00:03:53,480
We used technology to measure actually the
flow of consumers and where they're interested

68
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:56,439
and in which areas they intend to go.

69
00:03:56,439 --> 00:03:59,830
And that works all based on Beacon technologies.

70
00:03:59,830 --> 00:04:03,989
Which means retailers like Ikea will only
get better at nudging you to spend time in

71
00:04:03,989 --> 00:04:06,109
more parts of the store.

72
00:04:06,109 --> 00:04:10,819
So, compulsive shoppers, the next time
you go to the store… consider taking the

73
00:04:10,819 --> 00:04:11,819
shortcut.

74
00:04:11,819 --> 00:04:15,319
Or, at least, don't forget what you came here for.

75
00:04:15,319 --> 00:04:18,300
Because it probably wasn't 
plants and a plate of meatballs.

76
00:04:18,300 --> 00:00:00,000
You do you, though.
