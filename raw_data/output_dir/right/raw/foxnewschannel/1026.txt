1
00:00:06,522 --> 00:00:08,122
>> IT'S CLEAR THAT THE PAST SET

2
00:00:08,122 --> 00:00:10,325
OF EFFORTS HAVE NOT SUCCEEDED.

3
00:00:10,325 --> 00:00:12,528
I'M A BELIEVER IN DIPLOMACY.

4
00:00:12,528 --> 00:00:16,565
AND I'M OPEN TO NEW METHODS OF

5
00:00:16,565 --> 00:00:17,299
TRYING TO ACCOMPLISH THE

6
00:00:17,299 --> 00:00:19,334
CONSISTENT OBJECTIVE THAT WE

7
00:00:19,334 --> 00:00:23,539
HAVE OF FULL DENUCLEARIZATION.

8
00:00:23,539 --> 00:00:25,240
I THINK THE QUESTION IS ARE WE

9
00:00:25,240 --> 00:00:26,241
WALKED IN PREPARED?

10
00:00:26,241 --> 00:00:28,243
ARE WE WALKING IN WITH OUR

11
00:00:28,243 --> 00:00:28,844
ALLIES BEHIND US?

12
00:00:28,844 --> 00:00:29,945
ARE WE IN A POSITION TO

13
00:00:29,945 --> 00:00:30,979
UNDERSTAND THAT ONE MEETING IS

14
00:00:30,979 --> 00:00:32,046
NOT GOING TO BE ONE AND DONE,

15
00:00:32,046 --> 00:00:36,218
THIS IS THE START OF A SERIOUS

16
00:00:36,218 --> 00:00:36,852
NEGOTIATING PROCESS.

17
00:00:36,852 --> 00:00:39,755
BRET: FORMER NATIONAL SECURITY

18
00:00:39,755 --> 00:00:40,789
ADVISOR SUSAN RICE TALKING ABOUT

19
00:00:40,789 --> 00:00:42,424
THIS UP COMING SUMMIT BETWEEN

20
00:00:42,424 --> 00:00:43,959
PRESIDENT TRUMP AND KIM JONG-UN,

21
00:00:43,959 --> 00:00:46,728
BOTH LEADERS TRAVELING A LONG

22
00:00:46,728 --> 00:00:47,095
DISTANCE.

23
00:00:47,095 --> 00:00:48,163
OBVIOUSLY COMING FROM CANADA,

24
00:00:48,163 --> 00:00:50,899
THE G-7 SUMMIT, THE PRESIDENT

25
00:00:50,899 --> 00:00:52,901
DID, BUT WASHINGTON, D.C. TO

26
00:00:52,901 --> 00:00:55,103
SINGAPORE HERE AND PYONGYANG.

27
00:00:55,103 --> 00:00:56,572
THIS IS THE FARTHEST THAT KIM

28
00:00:56,572 --> 00:00:57,839
JONG-UN HAS TRAVELED SINCE

29
00:00:57,839 --> 00:00:59,274
TAKING POWER IN 2011.

30
00:00:59,274 --> 00:01:01,543
NO SITTING PRESIDENT HAS MET

31
00:01:01,543 --> 00:01:03,478
WITH A LEADER AS FAR AS WE KNOW,

32
00:01:03,478 --> 00:01:07,516
A NORTH KOREAN LEADER OR SPOKEN

33
00:01:07,516 --> 00:01:08,450
TO ONE ON THE PHONE AS FAR AS WE

34
00:01:08,450 --> 00:01:08,750
KNOW.

35
00:01:08,750 --> 00:01:10,118
WHAT ABOUT THE EXPECTATIONS

36
00:01:10,118 --> 00:01:10,419
HERE?

37
00:01:10,419 --> 00:01:11,520
WHAT ARE THE POSSIBILITIES?

38
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:12,921
LET'S BRING IN OUR PANEL FROM

39
00:01:12,921 --> 00:01:13,522
D.C.

40
00:01:13,522 --> 00:01:15,357
MOLLY HEMMINGWAY, SENIOR EDITOR

41
00:01:15,357 --> 00:01:17,526
AT THE FEDERALIST, SUSAN PAGE,

42
00:01:17,526 --> 00:01:18,627
WASHINGTON BUREAU CHIEF AT USA

43
00:01:18,627 --> 00:01:19,027
TODAY.

44
00:01:19,027 --> 00:01:21,597
AND TOM ROGAN, COMMENTARY WRITER

45
00:01:21,597 --> 00:01:22,998
FOR THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER.

46
00:01:22,998 --> 00:01:26,168
TOM, I THINK THERE HAS BEEN A

47
00:01:26,301 --> 00:01:27,669
LITTLE BIT OF SAYING THIS COULD

48
00:01:27,669 --> 00:01:29,938
BE THE FIRST OF SEVERAL SUMMITS.

49
00:01:29,938 --> 00:01:32,307
WHAT ARE YOU THOUGHTS HEADING

50
00:01:32,307 --> 00:01:32,774
INTO TUESDAY?

51
00:01:32,774 --> 00:01:34,776
>> WELL, THE FIRST THING I THINK

52
00:01:34,776 --> 00:01:36,878
THAT IS CLEAR NOW THAT THIS

53
00:01:36,878 --> 00:01:37,946
PROGRESSIVE STEP PROCESS THAT

54
00:01:37,946 --> 00:01:39,348
THE NORTH KOREANS IN PARTICULAR

55
00:01:39,348 --> 00:01:40,215
WANTED WILL BE THE CASE.

56
00:01:40,215 --> 00:01:42,884
BUT I THINK ON THE PART OF THE

57
00:01:42,884 --> 00:01:46,688
TRUMP ADMINISTRATION, ESPECIALLY

58
00:01:46,688 --> 00:01:49,024
PUSHING THIS NARRATIVE BY

59
00:01:49,024 --> 00:01:50,125
SECRETARY OF STATE POMPEO BOTH

60
00:01:50,125 --> 00:01:52,027
OUTSIDE AND BESIGNED THE

61
00:01:52,027 --> 00:01:57,532
SCENE -- BEHIND THE SCENES, NEED

62
00:01:57,532 --> 00:02:00,102
TO HAVE SOME TANGIBLE PRODUCT

63
00:02:00,102 --> 00:02:01,903
BEHIND THIS SUMMIT.

64
00:02:01,903 --> 00:02:04,206
I THINK WHAT WILL BE SOME KIND

65
00:02:04,206 --> 00:02:08,043
OF LIMITED INSPECTION PRESENCE

66
00:02:08,043 --> 00:02:10,846
FROM THE IAEA IN NORTH KOREA

67
00:02:10,846 --> 00:02:11,647
FOLLOWING THE SUMMIT.

68
00:02:11,647 --> 00:02:13,882
HOW INTRUSIVE IS THAT?

69
00:02:13,882 --> 00:02:15,083
DOES IT INVOLVE SNAP

70
00:02:15,083 --> 00:02:15,484
INSPECTIONS?

71
00:02:15,484 --> 00:02:16,318
PRESIDENT TRUMP WILL NEED A

72
00:02:16,318 --> 00:02:17,452
DELIVERABLE THAT HE CAN SAY

73
00:02:17,452 --> 00:02:19,288
WELL, LOOK, THERE'S SOMETHING

74
00:02:19,288 --> 00:02:21,590
TANGIBLE HERE WHICH MEANS THIS

75
00:02:21,590 --> 00:02:22,491
PROCESS MUST GO ON.

76
00:02:22,491 --> 00:02:23,225
BRET: YEAH.

77
00:02:23,225 --> 00:02:23,525
SUSAN?

78
00:02:23,525 --> 00:02:24,960
>> YOU KNOW, I THINK THE ISSUE

79
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:26,695
IS NOT ONLY WHAT THE NORTH

80
00:02:26,695 --> 00:02:28,730
KOREANS AGREE TO DO BUT WHAT THE

81
00:02:28,730 --> 00:02:30,966
U.S. GIVES UP TO ACHIEVE SOME

82
00:02:30,966 --> 00:02:31,967
KIND OF DELIVERABLE, SOMETHING

83
00:02:31,967 --> 00:02:35,003
SO PRESIDENT TRUMP CAN SAY IT IS

84
00:02:35,003 --> 00:02:35,837
A SUCCESS.

85
00:02:35,837 --> 00:02:37,039
WE HAVE ALREADY GIVEN UP QUITE A

86
00:02:37,039 --> 00:02:37,306
BIT.

87
00:02:37,306 --> 00:02:38,307
WE HAVE GIVEN THIS MEETING WHICH

88
00:02:38,307 --> 00:02:39,374
THE NORTH KOREANS WANTED.

89
00:02:39,374 --> 00:02:40,575
WE ARE GOING TO HAVE THE PICTURE

90
00:02:40,575 --> 00:02:41,843
WHICH THE NORTH KOREANS HAVE

91
00:02:41,843 --> 00:02:43,245
WANTED OF THE TWO LEADERS

92
00:02:43,245 --> 00:02:44,613
SHAKING HANDS AS EQUALS.

93
00:02:44,613 --> 00:02:49,184
SO I THINK ONE CONCERN THAT SOME

94
00:02:49,184 --> 00:02:50,185
HAVE IS THAT THE UNITED STATES

95
00:02:50,185 --> 00:02:51,753
NOT GIVE MORE GROUND ON THINGS

96
00:02:51,753 --> 00:02:54,356
WITHOUT THE NORTH KOREANS TAKING

97
00:02:54,356 --> 00:02:55,891
TANGIBLE STEPS THAT ACTUALLY

98
00:02:55,891 --> 00:02:59,961
LEAD TO A REDUCTION OF THE

99
00:02:59,961 --> 00:03:00,462
NUCLEAR THREAT.

100
00:03:00,462 --> 00:03:01,963
>> ONE THING, MOLLY, THAT THE

101
00:03:01,963 --> 00:03:03,665
PRESIDENT SAID ON FRIDAY BEFORE

102
00:03:03,665 --> 00:03:05,834
LEAVING WAS THAT HE REALLY WANTS

103
00:03:05,834 --> 00:03:07,602
CONGRESS IN THIS WHOLE THING.

104
00:03:07,602 --> 00:03:08,637
TAKE A LISTEN.

105
00:03:08,637 --> 00:03:10,405
>> I WOULD ONLY DO A DEAL IF I

106
00:03:10,405 --> 00:03:11,707
GET IT THROUGH CONGRESS.

107
00:03:11,707 --> 00:03:16,678
I WOULDN'T DO LIKE OBAMA DID AND

108
00:03:16,678 --> 00:03:19,681
HE WASN'T ABLE TO GET IT

109
00:03:19,681 --> 00:03:20,015
THROUGH.

110
00:03:20,015 --> 00:03:21,383
HE TRIED TO GET IT THROUGH, THE

111
00:03:21,383 --> 00:03:22,751
IRAN DEAL, HE TRIED TO GET IT

112
00:03:22,751 --> 00:03:24,086
THROUGH CONGRESS, FAILED SO HE

113
00:03:24,086 --> 00:03:25,520
JUST DID IT WITHOUT WHICH IS WHY

114
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:27,222
I WAS ABLE TO BREAK IT UP SO

115
00:03:27,222 --> 00:03:27,689
EASY.

116
00:03:27,689 --> 00:03:29,791
>> SO I MEAN, ADDING TO THE

117
00:03:29,791 --> 00:03:34,129
CHALLENGES HERE, THE CHALLENGE

118
00:03:34,129 --> 00:03:35,997
TO GET -- TO GET CONGRESS TO GET

119
00:03:35,997 --> 00:03:37,232
AN ACTUAL TREATY THROUGH.

120
00:03:37,232 --> 00:03:38,900
>> IT IS ABSOLUTELY TRUE THAT

121
00:03:38,900 --> 00:03:41,103
PRESIDENT OBAMA'S FAILURE TO

122
00:03:41,103 --> 00:03:43,271
SEAL HIS IRAN DEAL WITH

123
00:03:43,271 --> 00:03:44,406
CONGRESSIONAL APPROVAL SEALED

124
00:03:44,406 --> 00:03:45,707
THE FATE OF THAT DEAL.

125
00:03:45,707 --> 00:03:47,042
IT IS VERY EASY TO CHANGE THINGS

126
00:03:47,042 --> 00:03:48,510
IF YOU DON'T HAVE TREATIED

127
00:03:48,510 --> 00:03:51,580
RATIFIED BY THE SENATE.

128
00:03:51,580 --> 00:03:52,948
-- TREATIES RATIFIED BY THE

129
00:03:52,948 --> 00:03:53,281
SENATE.

130
00:03:53,281 --> 00:03:54,316
IT IS IMPORTANT THAT THE SENATE

131
00:03:54,316 --> 00:03:55,884
BE ON BOARD AND THAT THE

132
00:03:55,884 --> 00:03:57,786
AMERICAN PEOPLE BE ON BOARD,

133
00:03:57,786 --> 00:03:59,388
UNDERSTAND FULLY WHAT WE ARE

134
00:03:59,388 --> 00:04:01,123
GIVING IN EXCHANGE FOR

135
00:04:01,123 --> 00:04:01,923
DENUCLEARIZATION IF THAT IS WHAT

136
00:04:01,923 --> 00:04:02,691
IS ON THE TABLE.

137
00:04:02,691 --> 00:04:04,860
IT IS ABSOLUTELY IMPORTANT THAT

138
00:04:04,860 --> 00:04:06,595
WE GET SOME INDICATION RIGHT

139
00:04:06,595 --> 00:04:07,662
AWAY THAT NORTH KOREA IS

140
00:04:07,662 --> 00:04:08,230
SERIOUS.

141
00:04:08,230 --> 00:04:10,265
THEY HAVE A LONG HISTORY OF

142
00:04:10,265 --> 00:04:12,234
PROMISING GRANDIOSE THINGS AND

143
00:04:12,234 --> 00:04:14,202
FAILING TO -- FAILING TO COMPLY

144
00:04:14,202 --> 00:04:15,103
WITH WHAT THEY HAVE PROMISED

145
00:04:15,103 --> 00:04:16,238
AFTER THEY GET THE GOODS FROM

146
00:04:16,238 --> 00:04:16,904
OTHER COUNTRIES.

147
00:04:16,904 --> 00:04:18,940
I DON'T THINK THE AMERICANS ARE

148
00:04:18,940 --> 00:04:22,043
INTERESTED IN THAT KIND OF

149
00:04:22,043 --> 00:04:23,412
AGREEMENT THIS TIME AROUND.

150
00:04:23,412 --> 00:04:25,013
>> YOU ASK AMERICANS ABOUT IT,

151
00:04:25,013 --> 00:04:27,249
AND WE TOOK A POLL, A FOX NEWS

152
00:04:27,249 --> 00:04:28,450
POLL RECENTLY AND YOU ASK THEM

153
00:04:28,450 --> 00:04:30,318
ABOUT THE POSSIBILITIES, WILL

154
00:04:30,318 --> 00:04:33,155
NORTH KOREA EVER GIVE UP ITS

155
00:04:33,155 --> 00:04:35,123
NUCLEAR WEAPONS?

156
00:04:35,123 --> 00:04:36,391
28% SAY NOW YES.

157
00:04:36,391 --> 00:04:37,025
60% SAY NO.

158
00:04:37,025 --> 00:04:39,227
AND YOU CAN SEE KIND OF THE

159
00:04:39,227 --> 00:04:40,829
CHANGE FROM MARCH OF 2018.

160
00:04:40,829 --> 00:04:42,364
THE OTHER QUESTION WAS, WHO

161
00:04:42,364 --> 00:04:44,833
WOULD GET THE BETTER DEAL?

162
00:04:44,833 --> 00:04:47,702
AND MOST PEOPLE NOW, 40% SAY

163
00:04:47,702 --> 00:04:49,538
DONALD TRUMP WOULD GET THE

164
00:04:49,538 --> 00:04:50,739
BETTER DEAL, KIM JONG-UN 30%.

165
00:04:50,739 --> 00:04:52,441
WE DON'T KNOW WHAT WE DON'T KNOW

166
00:04:52,441 --> 00:04:55,143
ABOUT BEHIND THE SCENES IN THESE

167
00:04:55,143 --> 00:04:56,378
NEGOTIATIONS, TOM, BUT THE FIRST

168
00:04:56,378 --> 00:04:57,646
MEETING IS GOING TO BE WITH THE

169
00:04:57,646 --> 00:04:59,614
TWO LEADERS AND JUST

170
00:04:59,614 --> 00:05:00,015
TRANSLATORS.

171
00:05:00,015 --> 00:05:00,449
NOBODY ELSE.

172
00:05:00,449 --> 00:05:01,917
>> YES, EXACTLY.

173
00:05:01,917 --> 00:05:03,385
AND YOU KNOW, APART FROM THE

174
00:05:03,385 --> 00:05:05,187
TENSIONS BETWEEN THE NORTH

175
00:05:05,187 --> 00:05:05,987
KOREAN AND SECURITY SERVICE AND

176
00:05:05,987 --> 00:05:07,689
THE SECRET SERVICE, YOU KNOW, I

177
00:05:07,689 --> 00:05:10,192
THINK THE BASELINE HERE WILL BE

178
00:05:10,192 --> 00:05:11,827
PRESIDENT TRUMP TESTING KIM

179
00:05:11,827 --> 00:05:13,328
JONG-UN AS TO WHAT HE CAN GET

180
00:05:13,328 --> 00:05:15,397
OUT OF IT.

181
00:05:15,397 --> 00:05:16,965
AND THE CRITICAL FACTOR AS WELL

182
00:05:16,965 --> 00:05:18,700
IS NOT JUST THE SUMMIT AND WHAT

183
00:05:18,700 --> 00:05:19,901
FOLLOWS IT BUT HOW EXTERNAL

184
00:05:19,901 --> 00:05:21,603
ACTORS REACT TO IT AS WELL,

185
00:05:21,603 --> 00:05:23,538
SPECIFICALLY THE CHINESE AND THE

186
00:05:23,538 --> 00:05:23,939
RUSSIANS.

187
00:05:23,939 --> 00:05:25,073
WE ALREADY SEE SOMEONE I HAVE

188
00:05:25,073 --> 00:05:25,974
TALKED TO WHO HAS BEEN IN NORTH

189
00:05:25,974 --> 00:05:27,509
KOREA RECENTLY MENTIONED THAT

190
00:05:27,509 --> 00:05:29,411
THE ACTUAL FLOW OF GOODS ACROSS

191
00:05:29,411 --> 00:05:31,713
THAT BORDER HAS SIGNIFICANTLY UP

192
00:05:31,713 --> 00:05:33,748
TICKED AS THE SUMMIT HAS

193
00:05:33,748 --> 00:05:35,617
PROGRESSED TO ITS ARRIVAL, AND

194
00:05:35,617 --> 00:05:37,085
SO FOR PRESIDENT TRUMP TO RETAIN

195
00:05:37,085 --> 00:05:39,554
THAT PRESSURE ALONGSIDE LITTLE

196
00:05:39,554 --> 00:05:40,889
CONCESSIONS AND LITTLE GAINS

197
00:05:40,889 --> 00:05:42,591
WILL BE A DIFFICULT BALANCING

198
00:05:42,591 --> 00:05:44,092
ACT BECAUSE OF COURSE IF THE

199
00:05:44,092 --> 00:05:45,594
CHINESE ARE ABLE TO DOUBLE DOWN

200
00:05:45,594 --> 00:05:49,231
THEIR SUPPORT FOR KIM JONG-UN IS

201
00:05:49,231 --> 00:05:50,131
INCENTIVE TO JUST PLAY THIS OUT

202
00:05:50,131 --> 00:05:54,269
AND BEHIND THE SCENES DEVELOP

203
00:05:54,269 --> 00:05:55,370
THE WAR HEAD VEHICLE -- THERE

204
00:05:55,370 --> 00:05:58,540
ARE A LOT OF MOVING PARTS HERE.

205
00:05:58,540 --> 00:06:00,242
MIKE POMPEO AS THE LEAD CIA

206
00:06:00,242 --> 00:06:02,177
DIRECTOR, HE HAS THE PRESIDENT'S

207
00:06:02,177 --> 00:06:03,111
TRUST AND ALSO HAS AN

208
00:06:03,111 --> 00:06:04,679
UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT IS GOING

209
00:06:04,679 --> 00:06:06,081
ON HERE.

210
00:06:06,081 --> 00:06:07,849
BRET: SUSAN, I HAVE HEARD

211
00:06:07,849 --> 00:06:09,050
ANECDOTALLY THAT KIM JONG-UN HAS

212
00:06:09,050 --> 00:06:12,354
EXPRESSED A NEED AND A WANT FOR

213
00:06:12,354 --> 00:06:15,023
INVESTMENT IN THIS COUNTRY, IN

214
00:06:15,023 --> 00:06:15,423
NORTH KOREA.

215
00:06:15,423 --> 00:06:17,392
AND EVEN HOTELS ALONG THE

216
00:06:17,392 --> 00:06:19,327
COASTLINE AND HAS KIND OF MUSED

217
00:06:19,327 --> 00:06:21,196
ABOUT THAT IN MEETINGS.

218
00:06:21,196 --> 00:06:23,231
THE QUESTION IS, IS GETTING FROM

219
00:06:23,231 --> 00:06:25,166
ONE POINT TO THE NEXT?

220
00:06:25,166 --> 00:06:28,036
>> YEAH, HAVING A McDONALD'S IN

221
00:06:28,036 --> 00:06:30,005
DOWNTOWN PYONGYANG THAT WOULD BE

222
00:06:30,005 --> 00:06:31,072
SOMETHING PERHAPS HE WOULD BE

223
00:06:31,072 --> 00:06:31,740
INTERESTED IN.

224
00:06:31,740 --> 00:06:32,941
WELL, I THINK WE'RE COUNTING ON

225
00:06:32,941 --> 00:06:33,241
THAT.

226
00:06:33,241 --> 00:06:35,210
I THINK WHEN YOU HEAR PRESIDENT

227
00:06:35,210 --> 00:06:37,379
TRUMP TALK ABOUT WHY NORTH KOREA

228
00:06:37,379 --> 00:06:38,947
MAY BE WILLING TO GIVE UP ITS

229
00:06:38,947 --> 00:06:40,849
NUKES AND THERE'S A LOT OF

230
00:06:40,849 --> 00:06:43,051
SKEPTICISM ABOUT THAT, IT IS

231
00:06:43,051 --> 00:06:44,119
BECAUSE IT COULD DRAW THE KIND

232
00:06:44,119 --> 00:06:45,153
OF INVESTMENT AND DEVELOPMENT

233
00:06:45,153 --> 00:06:46,688
THAT WOULD MAKE THINGS BETTER

234
00:06:46,688 --> 00:06:47,389
FOR THEIR PEOPLE.

235
00:06:47,389 --> 00:06:48,690
MOLLY MADE A GOOD POINT WHICH IS

236
00:06:48,690 --> 00:06:56,231
THAT NORTH KOREA HAS A HISTORY

237
00:06:56,231 --> 00:07:08,076
OF

238
00:07:08,076 --> 00:07:08,109
OF NO

239
00:07:08,109 --> 00:07:08,843
OF NOT

240
00:07:08,843 --> 00:07:08,877
OF NOT K

241
00:07:08,877 --> 00:07:08,910
OF NOT KEE

242
00:07:08,910 --> 00:07:08,944
OF NOT KEEPI

243
00:07:08,944 --> 00:07:10,145
OF NOT KEEPING

244
00:07:10,145 --> 00:07:10,178
OF NOT KEEPING W

245
00:07:10,178 --> 00:07:10,211
OF NOT KEEPING WIT

246
00:07:10,211 --> 00:07:12,480
OF NOT KEEPING WITH

247
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:12,514
OF NOT KEEPING WITH I

248
00:07:12,514 --> 00:07:14,382
OF NOT KEEPING WITH ITS

249
00:07:14,382 --> 00:07:14,416
OF NOT KEEPING WITH ITS D

250
00:07:14,416 --> 00:07:14,449
OF NOT KEEPING WITH ITS DEA

251
00:07:14,449 --> 00:07:14,482
OF NOT KEEPING WITH ITS DEALS

252
00:07:14,482 --> 00:07:18,587
OF NOT KEEPING WITH ITS DEALS.

253
00:07:18,587 --> 00:07:20,221
I WILL BE CURIOUS TO SEE IF IT

254
00:07:20,221 --> 00:07:23,224
RAISES ANY QUESTIONS ACROSS THE

255
00:07:23,224 --> 00:07:24,659
TABLE, ABOUT WHETHER THEY CAN

256
00:07:24,659 --> 00:07:25,594
COUNT ON THE UNITED STATES TO

257
00:07:25,594 --> 00:07:26,995
LIVE UP TO A DEAL THAT'S

258
00:07:26,995 --> 00:07:27,329
REACHED.

259
00:07:27,329 --> 00:07:28,430
BRET: AS I MENTIONED WITH THE

260
00:07:28,430 --> 00:07:30,565
PREVIOUS GROUP HERE IN

261
00:07:30,565 --> 00:07:32,634
SINGAPORE, MOLLY, IT SENDS TWO

262
00:07:32,634 --> 00:07:33,868
SIGNALS, ONE, MAYBE HE'S NOT

263
00:07:33,868 --> 00:07:38,306
GOING TO FOLLOW THROUGH ON SOME

264
00:07:38,306 --> 00:07:38,456
KUHN

265
00:07:38,456 --> 00:07:38,907
KUH

266
00:07:38,907 --> 00:07:39,674
COMMUNIQUE, BUT TWO HE WOULD GET

267
00:07:39,674 --> 00:07:40,642
UP FROM THE TABLE IF IT'S NOT

268
00:07:40,642 --> 00:07:42,010
THE DEAL AND LISTEN TO SOME

269
00:07:42,010 --> 00:07:42,911
LEADER SAY SOMETHING HE DOESN'T

270
00:07:42,911 --> 00:07:43,211
LIKE.

271
00:07:43,211 --> 00:07:44,713
>> FIRST OFF OUR CONSTITUTION

272
00:07:44,713 --> 00:07:46,181
PROVIDES A MEANS TO OTHER

273
00:07:46,181 --> 00:07:47,115
COUNTRIES TO FEEL CONFIDENT ON

274
00:07:47,115 --> 00:07:50,151
HOW WE HAVE COME TO A DECISION.

275
00:07:50,151 --> 00:07:51,219
THAT DOES INVOLVE RATIFICATION

276
00:07:51,219 --> 00:07:51,886
BY THE SENATE.

277
00:07:51,886 --> 00:07:53,488
THAT'S A NORM THAT SHOULD NOT

278
00:07:53,488 --> 00:07:54,456
HAVE BEEN BREACHED BY PREVIOUS

279
00:07:54,456 --> 00:07:55,123
ADMINISTRATIONS AND IT IS

280
00:07:55,123 --> 00:07:56,224
SOMETHING THAT REALLY WORKS WELL

281
00:07:56,224 --> 00:07:57,592
AND IT IS ALREADY IN OUR SYSTEM.

282
00:07:57,592 --> 00:07:59,394
IT IS ALSO TRUE THAT DONALD

283
00:07:59,394 --> 00:08:00,996
TRUMP BEHAVES IN A VERY

284
00:08:00,996 --> 00:08:01,663
UNPRECEDENTED MANNER.

285
00:08:01,663 --> 00:08:03,198
HE DOES NOT SEEM TO THINK THAT

286
00:08:03,198 --> 00:08:07,035
THE GLOBAL ORDER AS ORCHESTRATED

287
00:08:07,035 --> 00:08:08,036
BY OTHERS FOR THE PAST SEVERAL

288
00:08:08,036 --> 00:08:08,870
DECADES IS NECESSARILY GOOD.

289
00:08:08,870 --> 00:08:10,605
WE SEE IN NORTH KOREA IT HAS NOT

290
00:08:10,605 --> 00:08:12,741
WORKED OUT WELL FOR MANY

291
00:08:12,741 --> 00:08:13,074
DECADES.

292
00:08:13,074 --> 00:08:13,775
THAT CROSSES PARTY LINES AND

293
00:08:13,775 --> 00:08:15,677
MANY ADMINISTRATIONS, SO HE IS

294
00:08:15,677 --> 00:00:00,000
LOOKING TO DO SOMETHING
