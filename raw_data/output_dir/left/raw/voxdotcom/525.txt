1
00:00:01,240 --> 00:00:05,750
Over 250 people are dead and thousands of
military members have been arrested after

2
00:00:05,750 --> 00:00:11,360
an attempted coup against Turkish President
Recep Tayyip Erdoğan. Though he was on vacation

3
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:15,749
at the time, Erdoğan reached the media through
Facetime and urged his supporters into the

4
00:00:15,749 --> 00:00:22,779
streets of Ankara and Istanbul. Now the increasingly
authoritarian president is likely to use the

5
00:00:22,779 --> 00:00:28,730
botched coup as pretext to continue consolidating
power. We don’t yet know who was behind

6
00:00:28,730 --> 00:00:34,440
the plot, but a faction within the military
issued a statement saying they sought “to

7
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:39,630
reinstate constitutional order, human rights
and freedom.” They called themselves the

8
00:00:39,630 --> 00:00:45,180
Peace at Home council. That’s reference
to Mustafa Kemal Attaturk, the military officer

9
00:00:45,180 --> 00:00:52,420
who established Turkey’s secular state from
the ashes of the old Ottoman Empire in 1923.

10
00:00:52,420 --> 00:00:56,900
Since Turkey’s founding, the military has
seen itself as defenders of the secular and

11
00:00:56,900 --> 00:01:02,170
democratic principles of Kemalism. So whenever
the nation’s political order was challenged,

12
00:01:02,170 --> 00:01:07,420
the military would intervene. But the latest
attempt didn’t appear to have the full support

13
00:01:07,420 --> 00:01:13,859
of military leaders, which is likely one reason
it failed. Erdogan is blaming the latest coup

14
00:01:13,859 --> 00:01:19,890
attempt on Gülenists, the followers of exiled
Sunni cleric Fetullah Gulen, who now lives

15
00:01:19,890 --> 00:01:25,880
in Pennsylvania. Once an ally to Erdoğan,
Gülen’s media outlets have accused the president

16
00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:31,640
of corruption. And in response, Erdoğan seized
Gulen’s media assets and labeled his sizeable

17
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:37,090
political party a terrorist movement. Now,
Erdoğan is calling for the US to arrest and

18
00:01:37,090 --> 00:01:42,780
extradite Gulen, who in turn, alleges that
Erdoğan himself staged the whole thing. There

19
00:01:42,780 --> 00:01:48,619
may not be an appetite for military coups
among Turks today, but Erdoğan is increasingly

20
00:01:48,619 --> 00:01:55,729
unpopular. As prime minister for 11 years
before being elected president in 2014, he

21
00:01:55,729 --> 00:02:00,859
has pushed for constitutional changes that
would grant him more power, cracked down on

22
00:02:00,859 --> 00:02:06,619
domestic protests, and prosecuted dissenting
academics and journalists. This guy was even

23
00:02:06,619 --> 00:02:11,990
put on trial for photoshopping Erdoğan next
to Gollum from Lord of the Rings. And the

24
00:02:11,990 --> 00:02:16,710
fact that he built himself a thousand-room
palace didn’t calm concerns that he’s

25
00:02:16,710 --> 00:02:23,080
got plans for long-term rule. A publicly religious
man, Erdoğan raised eyebrows among Turkey’s

26
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:28,470
staunch secularists with school reforms that
expand Islamic education. And he’s been

27
00:02:28,470 --> 00:02:33,140
criticized for allowing Turkey’s southern
border with Syria to remain porous. This has

28
00:02:33,140 --> 00:02:40,330
made Turkey an entry point for ISIS fighters.
The European Union may have some leverage

29
00:02:40,330 --> 00:02:45,590
to encourage reform, since Turkey has long
sought to join the union. But Turkey’s political

30
00:02:45,590 --> 00:02:50,240
stability is vital.
Europe depends on Erdoğan to help manage the

31
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:55,980
ongoing Syrian refugee crisis. and the US
uses airbases there to stage bombing raids

32
00:02:55,980 --> 00:03:02,430
against ISIS in Syria. Right now Turkey’s
first order of business will be to re-establish

33
00:03:02,430 --> 00:03:08,230
political order. And early indications from
Erdoğan and his allies suggest his methods

34
00:03:08,230 --> 00:00:00,000
will not be democratic in nature.
