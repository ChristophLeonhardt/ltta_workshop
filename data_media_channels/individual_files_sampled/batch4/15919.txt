you may already be aware that the military charity Canada company first accepted and then declined a fifteen thousand dollar donation that the rebel had raised from you our generous viewers as we reported Canada company's abrupt and inexplicable about-face was likely due to political interference from the federal Liberals yet a question arises why would Canada company take their marching orders from a government that seems to have zero respect for Canada company in the first place Canada company is a good military charity run by good people unfortunately as reported earlier this month Canada company excepted and then within a few hours declined your donation of more than fifteen thousand dollars money that was earmarked to help Canada's troops and their families this was the second time the rebel has been thwarted from making a donation to the military CFB Borden was the first to turn down our check last December again most likely due to political interference but recently I stumbled across a fascinating story that makes me question aloud why the folks at Canada company are such team players when it comes to playing ball with the Trudeau liberals because according to a CBC story a few weeks ago Canada company was essentially screwed over by the feds here's the headline Ottawa shelving million-dollar job app for veterans the Dec reads federal government chose to go with private company over charity now according to the report folks the government was hoping to launch a searchable online program and app that would help soldiers make a smoother transition to civilian life the feds spent some 1.1 million on this app but then the app was abruptly mothballed but here's where it gets really interesting the software smartphone app in the intellectual property associated with the program belonged to a drumroll please a company however a human resources firm based in Oshawa Ontario called a jhalak was subsequently and quietly awarded the ten point three million dollar contract last December and while a jhalak was given the opportunity to take over the system that was developed by Canada company the company turned that offer down for reasons that still remain unknown it gets worse according to the CBC report a jhalak has its own set of databases and search tools but those databases and search tools are not considered as comprehensive as the ones that were already developed by Canada company so to recap more than a million dollars is invested into a service developed by Canada company which is meant to help veterans then that service is jettisoned and when the project is handed over to another company the end result is something that's allegedly inferior to what Canada company had originally developed what the hell does this sound right to you especially since many ex-soldiers have a hard time finding employment don't we want the best tech for them the tech that was being developed by Canada company but here's the crux of the matter as it pertains to the rebel source donation that Canada company first accepted and then declined why is Canada company being so blindly loyal to the Trudeau Liberals this is a government that treats soldiers as disposable commodities this is a government that treats Canada company like a doormat yet Canada company much like a proverbial good soldier who never questions orders just stands there and takes whatever indignity this government fires its way we heard but enough is enough folks if you haven't already done so please visit call off your dog's comm and sign our petition please tell this government that you are not okay with the fact that they love playing vindictive politics more than they love helping our soldiers that's not right in fact it's downright despicable so please visit call off dogs calm and sign the petition thank you hey folks please visit call off your dogs calm sign the petition and I'll do everything in my power to personally deliver it to the Minister of Defense himself you
