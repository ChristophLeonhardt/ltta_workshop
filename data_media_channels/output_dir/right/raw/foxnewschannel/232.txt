1
00:00:02,358 --> 00:00:04,660
THE HOUR WITH "SHEPARD SMITH

2
00:00:04,661 --> 00:00:05,060
REPORTING."

3
00:00:05,061 --> 00:00:05,527
SEE YOU THEN.

4
00:00:05,528 --> 00:00:06,528
>> Dana: VOTING RIGHTS A FLASH

5
00:00:06,529 --> 00:00:10,065
POINT IN THE GEORGIA GOVERNOR'S

6
00:00:10,066 --> 00:00:10,365
RACE.

7
00:00:10,366 --> 00:00:14,169
STACY ABRAMS AGAINST RYAN BRIAN

8
00:00:14,170 --> 00:00:15,270
KEMP WHO IS SECRETARY OF STATE.

9
00:00:15,271 --> 00:00:17,406
HE'S IN CHARGE OF ELECTIONS AND

10
00:00:17,407 --> 00:00:18,974
VOTER REGISTRATION.

11
00:00:18,975 --> 00:00:21,009
ABRAMS AND GROUPS SAY KEMP IS

12
00:00:21,010 --> 00:00:23,111
USES HIS OFFICE TO SUPPRESS THE

13
00:00:23,112 --> 00:00:23,845
VOTE WHICH AFFECTS AFRICAN

14
00:00:23,846 --> 00:00:25,647
AMERICAN AND MINORITY VOTERS.

15
00:00:25,648 --> 00:00:28,984
KEMP DENIES THE ACCUSATIONS.

16
00:00:28,985 --> 00:00:32,187
>> BLACK PEOPLE HAVE AN ISSUE

17
00:00:32,188 --> 00:00:34,723
WITH THE WORLD "AGAIN."

18
00:00:34,724 --> 00:00:35,991
MY FEELING FROM THAT IS BECAUSE

19
00:00:35,992 --> 00:00:38,961
I'M GOING ALL THE WAY TO SIGNAL

20
00:00:38,962 --> 00:00:39,227
IT.

21
00:00:39,228 --> 00:00:40,429
ALL WE HAVE IS NOW.

22
00:00:40,430 --> 00:00:41,630
ALL WE HAVE IS TODAY.

23
00:00:41,631 --> 00:00:43,732
THE WORD AGAIN DOESN'T HURT US

24
00:00:43,733 --> 00:00:46,768
BECAUSE OF THE IDEA OF RACISM

25
00:00:46,769 --> 00:00:49,104
AND SLAVERY.

26
00:00:49,105 --> 00:00:50,605
IT HURTS US BECAUSE WE NEED TO

27
00:00:50,606 --> 00:00:55,377
FOCUS ON WHO WE ARE NOW, TODAY.

28
00:00:55,378 --> 00:00:56,645
>> Dana: THAT'S KANYE WEST IN

29
00:00:56,646 --> 00:00:58,180
HIS VISIT TO THE WHITE HOUSE.

30
00:00:58,181 --> 00:01:00,248
THE MEDIA BLASTING WEST AND

31
00:01:00,249 --> 00:01:02,217
QUESTIONING HIS MENTAL HEALTH.

32
00:01:02,218 --> 00:01:05,387
A SHARP CONTRAST FROM WHAT

33
00:01:05,388 --> 00:01:07,756
TAYLOR SWIFT SAW AFTER SHE BROKE

34
00:01:07,757 --> 00:01:14,997
HER STANCE OF NOT COMMENTING ON

35
00:01:14,998 --> 00:01:15,364
POLITICS.

36
00:01:15,365 --> 00:01:16,932
THE COUNTRY IS DIVIDED INTO THE

37
00:01:16,933 --> 00:01:20,335
TWO CAMPS, THE WOKE AND THE

38
00:01:20,336 --> 00:01:20,736
RESENTFUL.

39
00:01:20,737 --> 00:01:22,971
THEY DECEMBER AGREE VEHEMENTLY

40
00:01:22,972 --> 00:01:26,441
AS MOST ROUTINELY ABOUT THE

41
00:01:26,442 --> 00:01:29,144
CATCH-ALL KNOWN AS POLITICAL

42
00:01:29,145 --> 00:01:29,544
CORRECTNESS.

43
00:01:29,545 --> 00:01:31,279
I'M JOINT BY TYRUS.

44
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:33,048
I LOVE TALKING TO YOU BECAUSE

45
00:01:33,049 --> 00:01:34,750
YOU CAN HELP ME GET OUT OF MY

46
00:01:34,751 --> 00:01:35,617
NEW YORK BUBBLE.

47
00:01:35,618 --> 00:01:38,153
>> IT'S A BIG BUBBLE.

48
00:01:38,154 --> 00:01:39,154
>> Dana: THAT'S TRUE.

49
00:01:39,155 --> 00:01:41,089
POLITICS IS DOWNSTREAM OF

50
00:01:41,090 --> 00:01:42,324
CULTURE, THIS WEEK CULTURE AND

51
00:01:42,325 --> 00:01:44,359
POLITICS COLLIDED.

52
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:45,727
WHAT DID YOU THINK ABOUT THAT?

53
00:01:45,728 --> 00:01:48,030
>> TO BE COMPLETELY HONEST, I

54
00:01:48,031 --> 00:01:48,597
DIDN'T CARE.

55
00:01:48,598 --> 00:01:52,834
GOOD FOR HIM HE GOT TO MEET THE

56
00:01:52,835 --> 00:01:53,435
PRESIDENT.

57
00:01:53,436 --> 00:01:54,970
HE WAS STAR STRUCK A LITTLE BIT.

58
00:01:54,971 --> 00:01:55,937
RIGHTFULLY SO.

59
00:01:55,938 --> 00:01:58,206
IF I GOT A CHANCE TO MEET LOU

60
00:01:58,207 --> 00:02:00,409
FERRIGNO FOR THE DAY, I WOULD

61
00:02:00,410 --> 00:02:03,311
PROBABLY TALK THE SAME WAY THAT

62
00:02:03,312 --> 00:02:03,879
KANYE WEST HAS.

63
00:02:03,880 --> 00:02:09,418
HE WAS MY HERO FOR A CHILD.

64
00:02:09,419 --> 00:02:15,190
POLITICAL-WISE, HE WASN'TING

65
00:02:15,191 --> 00:02:15,524
ANYBODY.

66
00:02:15,525 --> 00:02:17,259
HE DIDN'T REPRESENT THE BLACK

67
00:02:17,260 --> 00:02:17,626
COMMUNITY.

68
00:02:17,627 --> 00:02:19,027
HE REPRESENTS KANYE WEST MEETING

69
00:02:19,028 --> 00:02:19,761
THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED

70
00:02:19,762 --> 00:02:22,164
STATES, WHICH IS A GREAT HONOR.

71
00:02:22,165 --> 00:02:24,933
I PROBABLY WOULD HAVE A LITTLE

72
00:02:24,934 --> 00:02:26,168
BETTER PREPARED STATEMENT.

73
00:02:26,169 --> 00:02:27,402
SOMETIMES AS WE KNOW, SOMETIMES

74
00:02:27,403 --> 00:02:28,937
WE TALK AND WE DON'T KNOW HOW TO

75
00:02:28,938 --> 00:02:30,972
END A SENTENCE BECAUSE WE'RE

76
00:02:30,973 --> 00:02:31,306
EXCITED.

77
00:02:31,307 --> 00:02:32,107
LIKE RIGHT NOW.

78
00:02:32,108 --> 00:02:33,476
A SITUATION IDEA.

79
00:02:33,477 --> 00:02:36,779
THIS WOULD BE BETWEEN PEOPLE

80
00:02:36,780 --> 00:02:38,681
HOSPITAL BRACELETS.

81
00:02:38,682 --> 00:02:44,020
>> RAPPER T.I. SAYS I REFUSE TO

82
00:02:44,021 --> 00:02:45,388
ASSOCIATE MYSELF ON SOMEONE SO

83
00:02:45,389 --> 00:02:45,688
VILE.

84
00:02:45,689 --> 00:02:47,189
AT ONE TIME IT WAS A PLEASURE TO

85
00:02:47,190 --> 00:02:48,324
WORK ALONGSIDE YOU.

86
00:02:48,325 --> 00:02:49,859
NOW I'M A SHAMED TO HAVE EVER

87
00:02:49,860 --> 00:02:51,660
BEEN ASSOCIATED WITH YOU.

88
00:02:51,661 --> 00:02:52,995
I THINK YOUR POINT THAT KANYE

89
00:02:52,996 --> 00:02:57,066
WEST WAS THERE FOR HIMSELF.

90
00:02:57,067 --> 00:03:00,036
WHY IS IT THAT OTHERS FEEL LIKE

91
00:03:00,037 --> 00:03:03,739
HE WAS SPEAKING FOR THE AFRICAN

92
00:03:03,740 --> 00:03:04,273
AMERICAN COMMUNITY?

93
00:03:04,274 --> 00:03:06,175
>> ANY TIME YOU TAKE A RISK TO

94
00:03:06,176 --> 00:03:08,277
SUPPORT SOMEBODY, ESPECIALLY --

95
00:03:08,278 --> 00:03:09,779
HE GENERALLY HAS AN AFFECTION

96
00:03:09,780 --> 00:03:11,213
FOR THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED

97
00:03:11,214 --> 00:03:12,081
STATES, WHICH IS FINE.

98
00:03:12,082 --> 00:03:13,282
YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE PEOPLE THAT

99
00:03:13,283 --> 00:03:14,817
ARE GOING TO ATTACK YOU.

100
00:03:14,818 --> 00:03:16,419
IT'S THE WAY WE DO BUSINESS IN

101
00:03:16,420 --> 00:03:18,988
THIS COUNTRY NOW.

102
00:03:18,989 --> 00:03:20,289
KANYE HAS EVERY RIGHT TO SAY AND

103
00:03:20,290 --> 00:03:21,557
DO WHATEVER HE WANTS TO DO.

104
00:03:21,558 --> 00:03:23,559
I DON'T HAVE TO AGREE WITH IT, I

105
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:24,794
DON'T HAVE TO SUPPORT IT.

106
00:03:24,795 --> 00:03:25,761
HE HAS THE RIGHT.

107
00:03:25,762 --> 00:03:29,098
LIKE I HAVE A RIGHT TO BE

108
00:03:29,099 --> 00:03:31,000
EXCITED ABOUT MEETING LOU

109
00:03:31,001 --> 00:03:31,367
FERRIGNO.

110
00:03:31,368 --> 00:03:32,535
WHERE IT GOES FROM HERE, WE

111
00:03:32,536 --> 00:03:33,035
DON'T KNOW.

112
00:03:33,036 --> 00:03:34,470
MAYBE THAT OPENS THE DOOR TO

113
00:03:34,471 --> 00:03:35,738
SOMETHING, MAYBE IT DOESN'T.

114
00:03:35,739 --> 00:03:38,174
HE HAS EVERY RIGHT AND I SUPPORT

115
00:03:38,175 --> 00:03:38,641
HIM.

116
00:03:38,642 --> 00:03:40,076
IF IT WASN'T A GREAT SPEECH, IT

117
00:03:40,077 --> 00:03:43,579
WASN'T THERE BUT THE MEDIA WAS

118
00:03:43,580 --> 00:03:45,981
THERE EATING IT UP.

119
00:03:45,982 --> 00:03:49,518
>> ELLEN DeGENERES AS A

120
00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:50,519
COMPARISON, WHEN TAYLOR SWIFT

121
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:55,424
SAID SHE WAS -- SHE ASKED HER

122
00:03:55,425 --> 00:03:57,126
FOLLOWERS TO VOTE, ELLEN SAID

123
00:03:57,127 --> 00:03:58,260
SOMETIMES YOU CAN SHAKE IT OFF

124
00:03:58,261 --> 00:03:59,595
AND SOMETIMES YOU HAVE TO SPEAK

125
00:03:59,596 --> 00:04:00,429
IT UP.

126
00:04:00,430 --> 00:04:03,365
SO MUCH LOVE AND RESPECT, TAYLOR

127
00:04:03,366 --> 00:04:03,799
SWIFT.

128
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:06,368
IF KANYE WEST HAD SAID SOMETHING

129
00:04:06,369 --> 00:04:07,303
DEROGATORY TOWARDS THE PRESIDENT

130
00:04:07,304 --> 00:04:08,971
OR NOT COMPLIMENTARY OR HE WOULD

131
00:04:08,972 --> 00:04:10,506
HAVE MAYBE HAD A DIFFERENT

132
00:04:10,507 --> 00:04:11,407
RECEPTION.

133
00:04:11,408 --> 00:04:13,342
>> I THINK WE LIVE IN A TIME

134
00:04:13,343 --> 00:04:14,110
WHERE EVERYTHING IS CONVENIENCED

135
00:04:14,111 --> 00:04:15,444
TO HOW I FEEL.

136
00:04:15,445 --> 00:04:16,779
IF YOU DON'T SOMETHING TO I

137
00:04:16,779 --> 00:04:19,681
DON'T LIKE, I'M GOING TO ATTACK

138
00:04:19,683 --> 00:04:19,949
YOU.

139
00:04:19,950 --> 00:04:22,518
IF YOU DO SOMETHING I LIKE, I

140
00:04:22,519 --> 00:04:25,855
CAN PIGGYBACK AND PRAISE YOU FOR

141
00:04:25,856 --> 00:04:27,423
IT.

142
00:04:27,424 --> 00:04:28,557
KANYE SHOWED LOVE FOR THE

143
00:04:28,558 --> 00:04:28,924
PRESIDENT.

144
00:04:28,925 --> 00:04:32,027
TAYLOR SWIFT WAS A LITTLE MORE,

145
00:04:32,028 --> 00:04:33,462
YES, SHE'S SUPPORTING THE

146
00:04:33,463 --> 00:04:35,097
DEMOCRAT, BUT SHE WAS KIND OF

147
00:04:35,098 --> 00:04:37,032
LIKE JUST REGISTER THE VOTE.

148
00:04:37,033 --> 00:04:38,300
SHE WAS MORE LIKE LET'S GET

149
00:04:38,301 --> 00:04:38,701
INVOLVED.

150
00:04:38,702 --> 00:00:00,000
THAT WAS A LITTLE LIGHTER.
