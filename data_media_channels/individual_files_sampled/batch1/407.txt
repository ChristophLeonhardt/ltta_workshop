Nigeria's missing schoolgirls dozens more are abducted by Boko Haram the government says it's a national disaster but what's it doing to fend off the threat and reduce public anger this is inside story hello and welcome to the program I'm Mohammed Jim Jim more than 100 Nigerian schoolgirls were kidnapped from the village of dachi this week presumably by the armed group Boko Haram and if this all sounds eerily familiar to you it's because it is Boko Haram abducted 276 schoolgirls from nearby chibok village in 2014 and many of them are still missing President Muhammadu Buhari had declared Boko Haram defeated but these kidnappings suggest otherwise what will it take to protect Nigeria schoolgirls from the armed group we'll get to our guests in a moment but first hominid Reece was the first international journalist to visit dabkey since the kidnappings here's his exclusive report disappointment in dutchy hours after parents were told their daughters have been rescued the state government apologized saying the information was not true for the relatives of more than 90 students the wait has just begun some say it's chibok all over again these sisters have not only escaped the kidnappers but their older sister wasn't as lucky the incident leaves them devastated they came just after we broke out Monday fast we heard gunshots there was chaos everywhere she tried to comfort us but it only got worse four of us sisters started running together she fell and I fell down - but someone picked me up that was the last time I saw her she was taken neighbor's pour into their home to offer support at the girls school we were refused access to film inside I would necessarily attackers dressed in military fatigues drove through the school gates but before they got in many of the girls alerted by the gunshots fired early on scale the perimeter fence of the school and escaped but some girls say they saw some of their schoolmates being led into a waiting truck so they early and his family thought they too will receive 14-year old Xena but she was one of the school girls taken do tonight as my mother is in hospital she fainted on hearing that her daughter wasn't found and grief is too much for her is that much as expected of the second-year high school student for now they continue to wait hoping to hear good and definitive news about the return of their child residents hope the tragedy won't be as long drone as a 2014 chibok incident where more than two hundred and seventy girls were kidnapped from the school more than a third of them are yet to be found muhammad idris al jazeera GG Boko Haram is by no means a new aggressor in Nigeria the group began its violent rebellion in 2009 and has killed at least 20,000 people since then mostly in northeastern Nigeria Boko Haram means Western education is a sin which is why the group keeps attacking schools it pledged allegiance to ISIL in 2015 and stepped up attacks in neighboring countries that led Chad Cameroon and Niger to send military support for the Nigerian Army which for the past two years has repeatedly declared Boko Haram defeated let's bring in our guests joining us from Abuja is Mike Ejiofor former director of Nigeria state security service and from Birmingham in the UK is alia Musa researcher on war and conflict at Coventry University and a specialist on Boko Haram and by Skype also from Abuja his bookie Shani Bari co-founder of the bring back our girls movement thank you all for joining us Mike given the fact the Nigeria's government has said in the past that Boko Haram has all but been defeated how is it that this could happen again well it's not surprising Nigeria is not alone in this fight against terrorism or insurgency many countries you recall Island Iraq Pakistan they have been fighting this war without end and there's no way con men should have , that's where I disagree with government to say that Boko Haram has been defeated it's going to be difficult to conclude that Focolare hospital step up attacks which has continued and if you look at it these people have come up attacking institutions because they believe that Western education to them is a sin and schools are not become the targets so there's no point there's no need giving the timeline to such a afraid because in a symmetric or earlier how is the response from the government differed this time than it did in 2014 when the chibok girls were kidnapped what wouldn't say completely that the response has been the same but of course giving the results we would say not much has been learned from the misfortune of 2014 it is true that this government has come out to admit that girls were missing but at the beginning there were there was confusion clearly there was confusion the military said they had rescued the girls but any channel that was untrue which was what angered the parent of the girls the parents of the girls so what has been happening is not much lesson has been learned from what happened in 2014 open to you now so of course we should admit also that the government the president said he he he wasn't happy with what happened he has deployed the military to do whatever he could to get by the girls but any question is when will they get back the girls and why did they in the first place let that happen it shouldn't have happened if we had learned any lesson from what happened in 2014 but you of course are still fighting for the release of the remaining chibok girls that are still missing what's the status of the negotiations when it comes to trying to free them what we have seen so far as it relates to the chibok girls that have been released is that we have 107 girls go back over 98% of them were brought back through negotiation while you know a few of them escaped so that tells us that negotiation being a non-military action seems to be working quite well in getting back these hostages the same in terms of negotiation was also considered when the we sent the women from the police women and the university lecturers were negotiated for and brought back so the current status isn't that of the 276 table girls that way abducted we have 107 of them got back if the seven of them escaped that means we are waiting for 112 she brought girls to still we've got back so that tells us that negotiation seems to now be the rule of the game in bringing back those hostages Mike how have the dynamics and the tactics of Boko Haram changed you know since 2009 or 2014 compared to now well you see the dynamics are changing if you recall that when the president was in office he taught the West African Strawbridge on contact us from work our stars' is not a fight against the insurgency or the bukhara that also led to the lifting of the de law which prohibited the sale of arms to the United States by United States of America to Nigeria and with the cooperation they are getting with the multinational Joint Task Force America has now agreed to sell 12 to connote a two-night aircraft to Nigeria Jordan has donated 200 armored vehicles UK everybody so I think we were making progress but we can still do better all right Ali you one of the reasons that at least some of the girls have been released has been because of negotiation but do you believe that negotiation with Boko Haram has emboldened them to carry out even more kidnappings absolutely I agree that some negotiation while I sympathize with the parents of tools and families of those that have been abducted including people who have been abducted I think the kind of negotiation the government has been having with these terrorists has a kind of imposing these criminals to carry out more attacks let us put it this way it is me now let's assume I am fighting with someone and then that person needs weapons or needs resources to fight and then I keep giving that person the money or the resources to fight me how would that fight ever end and that is what is happening and I think it's time the government negotiates with these criminals what happens comes to be worse than what happened previously we know after the girls were released on two previous occasions the attacks increased and we've seen what just happened after the lecturers in University of Madrid were released so I think while the government is right in negotiating with the imported should be thinking of the kind of concessions they make to this criminals because in the end they are helping them to to finance their war I mean they're helping the criminals to fine idea there was bye-bye I mean there with money and also by religion their colleagues that are in the government custody so I think while I agree with bring back our girls with their campaign and trying to get the girls back but I think by focusing on Jo's Chewbacca's they are getting things wrong there are lot of people that have been abducted by Boko Haram but just narrowing down to focus and seem that because we've got 100 of them or more then that is the end of it it doesn't work well we need to get the government to get things right by doing the right things and giving out things to criminals that'll make them come back more kind of emboldened to carry out more criminal attacks doesn't work how are you I want to follow up with you Amnesty International has reported that at least 2,000 women and girls have been abducted by Boko Haram the past few years and they've said that they believe that they have potentially been sold into sexual slavery what has been done or what is being done to try and secure their release what like I said the problem is that because many of these girls and women and even boys that have been abducted we are taking away at a point nobody notice and nobody cared about them nothing has been done not much has been done to bring them back I give examples of from young men of a phone folder of them they were taking away some time back nobody has heard from them the government has not done anything there is no campaign for them so what is happening is that nobody really cares about them so there are so many of them that have been taken away but because nobody's saying anything about them then they remain in the captivity of Boko Haram on a number of occasions where towns or villages or whole communities were taking over by Boko Haram people were forced to be become members of Boko Haram these are conscripts who are also victims of Boko Haram or in the end when these towns elaborated the military end up putting those young men and women and even children in their custody accusing them of being Boko Haram sympathizers this becomes a kind of sort of double jeopardy for these people so I think it is a major problem because nobody is really talking about these victims that I call the unworthy victims okay obviously you're in constant contact with the parents of the chip girls now what is their reaction been to the news of the girls that were abducted in Dobb jail how is this impacting them especially emotionally I mean it simply brings back the memory of the different stages of living that this parent went through and by stages I mean at first when their girls were abducted the there was this hope that these girls will be brought back as soon as possible and then upon confirmation it gotten another grief and then for every day every month every year that we spend and in about 48 this time it will be four years since the chibok girls were abducted it Adrian's deep increase deeper the memory or the the grief that their girls have actually been missing now when you juxtapose that with that of the darky incidents that just gives you an idea of what could be going on in the minds of the parents of the child dirty girls considering the fact that no parent wants to wait for this long for their girls to be brought back and that same shock that same possibility you know is something that just you know wants everyone not just the parent but every Nigerian and well-wishes at first in much that we should close this and bring these girls back soon as possible so the parallel line is that of live is that of pain is that of anguish and is that of the possibility that they may have to stay longer which we are hoping does not happen Mike Boko Haram hasn't just carried out attacks in Nigeria they've also carried out attacks in neighboring countries so how much of a threat is the group not just in Nigeria but also for that region well if you recall that Boko Haram has established Islamic state in West Africa they also affiliated to ISIL it becomes a very big threat in the Strawbridge or not a little Nigeria and that is why it's important that Nigeria collaborates with various countries that form of the multinational Joint Task Force in the sub region to ensure that the expansion is the program is checked don't also forget the migration from this ahead arms coming from Sudan also put all this together is the major threat to the sub region not only to Nigeria I believe too that the world community should also come to the aid of the sub region particularly Nigeria across Nigeria the leading force within the sub region in terms of supply of arms exchange of information training and evolution of intelligence and exchange of intelligence I think that's important is key in fighting this soldiers also when Nigeria is always going through election next year so you have a lot of challenges that I will be coming up and you have series of challenges that we need to look into alia what are your thoughts on what Mike just said what are some concrete steps that the government in Nigeria can take or its allies can take in trying to more effectively combat Boko Haram well like Mike said I agree with him absolutely that some Boko Haram has been a medium in east to the like major threat to the whole of the sub region and it means be able to fight them there has to be a kind of combination of forces from Nigeria from Nietzsche Republic from Chad from Cameroon all over the region including getting support from the international community but having said that I think one big problem that the Nigerian government or Nigerian strategy for fighting book or harm Boko Haram has been is not being able to kind of from control them within restrict them within an environment and deal with them often when the military go after them the end up kind of scaring them away or scampering getting them to scamper away and when they are run away what happens is that because our borders are very porous they run into neighboring countries only for them to regroup and come back so I think that strategy that strategy should have change getting them into kind of box them into a particular point whereby you will get them if possible who'd kill them will be the best thing to do so I think the strategy has to change boki there's still deep distrust of the government in northern Nigeria how does that affect the fight against Boko Haram doesn't it make it that much harder for the government to effectively combat the group when the residents of that part of the country distrust the government so much the parties the disgust may not be so entrenched and may not be so widespread across the northern part of Nigeria especially because before the community part of the Borrelia administration the scale you know the intensity of the attacks by Boko Haram was so much that everyone just wanted something totally different we can't take away the fact that Nigeria has actually progressed you know considerably towards ending this Menace called Boko Haram and we are winning the war perhaps at you know different levels are different times so when you look across the the northern part of Nigeria particularly did not East a there's this level of confidence that had actually been raised considering how well we have been waging this war against Boko Haram however just like one of the speaker's had said we can't completely declare that we have defeated before them on to certain metrics have actually been been checked and ticked off and that is where the discuss actually swindles or or it it updates a different level so so far people are happy that if you celebrate Christmas New Year Salah with our bomb blast and all that but when you have much skill of of possible abduction like in the case of this dirty issue the abduction of the police remain some of these attacks that we still see he puts to question the effectiveness of a counterinsurgency war and when that question comes into play is when we have that disparity in terms of the level of trust that people have for the government and of course the trust level at a consistent pace is actually quite important for the counterinsurgency effort especially in terms of local intelligence gathering cooperation in the local level and all other necessities that is relevant between the local level and the government in winning this war mike has the fight against ISIL and the fact that ISIL has lost so much territory in the last couple of years in areas like Iraq and Syria has that contributed to Boko Haram getting more fighters and becoming more resurgent yes to some extent it has but you know that Boko Haram own itself started as a local terrorist group before it metamorphosed to align with other foreign terrorist groups like Isis and a possibility of Isis supplying arms and their forms finance to Boko Haram cannot be ruled out so these are the areas the government should look into to ensure that source blue post in terms of funding arms and ammunition blocked and it's a very big challenge and we must admit that Allah you can you envision a time in which a comprehensive peace agreement a settlement could actually be negotiated between the Nigerian government and Boko Haram what comprehensive peace agreement comes at the end of a conflict that is where one side eventually wins we have all agreed that Nigeria has not completely reached that point it has to get to a point whereby the government is able to box Boko Haram into a very very tight corner and Boko Haram will be on their knees begging now when they start looking for a way out then the government could now assemble experts to draft a set of agreement that would force Boko Haram to accept it and then that way we look for permanent solution to the problem otherwise by compensating them all agreeing in piecemeal by giving them money or releasing their their fighters the war would just go on and on forever so I think we haven't got to that stage we will get to the stage when the military are able to deal effectively with Boko Haram from a BBC report recently we understand that the soldiers were almost moments before capturing Abubakar Shekau the leader of Boko Haram until someone I mean I don't know who that someone was given an order that stopped them for 40 s within which time Abubakar Shekau was able to escape Boko Haram was able to mobilize and attack the military so I think things like these have to be checked by the government and be stopped otherwise who never get to that point where we defeat Boko Haram and unless we get to that point there will be no comprehensive peace agreement Buckey do you feel that the government is doing enough right now to convey to the people of Nigeria that they are actually going after Boko Haram in a correct way the government is not doing enough and disappointingly so and that is because when we are in a situation like this where there is a war situation so to speak and by war I mean codes and on codes one would certain kind of information that is being periodically released introduced the community into the public you know some that does not you know compromise the ongoing you know sensitive security situation that we are in and when we even when Nigerians were trying to build up that confidence especially we do with listen to the lease you know of some of the abductees and beyond the chibok girls and the police women and the investigator the server or the hundreds and thousands or let me say on rates of abductees that I would walk around that the military had actually been bringing back and that is you know kind of boosting the confidence and trust that Nigerian have but when you now have a situation like this you know bomb blast few bomb blast and then a magical kind of attack like this like that has happened in Turkey it's literally you know just slashed down that level of confidence that one has in the government so it lost in has to be done around communication in law still has to be done around security and safety of schools in law still has to be done around ensuring that communities are fortified enough against it's also the government can do that they won't be able to communicate by conduct and even it will be masked off with their words if they aren't able to show that beyond what we are telling you that we are defeating these people you can see with the action on today that alignment between the words and actions people were still struggle with that confidence level with the government all right we're gonna have to leave it there
