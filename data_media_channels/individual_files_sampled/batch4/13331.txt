the left and the news medium but I repeat myself are now in full attack mode trying to strip you of the god-given right to bear arms that's protected by the Constitution God himself has not weighed in on the issue yet except by making brian Stelter look like brian Stelter which maybe all the comments he felt was required since the left and the news media but i repeat myself always need someone to demonize in these debates they're going after the National Rifle Association because it defends the god-given right to bear arms protected by the Constitution that the left in the media but I repeat myself are trying to take away the NRA is not represented by someone who looks like brian Stelter but is instead represented by Dana lash and just just saying because the left in the news media but I repeat myself for such caring and compassionate people they've chosen to exploit traumatized young people who know nothing about anything to make their case in what left this law professor Lawrence tribe has dubbed a Children's Crusade the Children's Crusade you'll remember was the legendary 13th century march of Christian children against the Muslims which ended with most of the children being killed at sea were sold into slavery so that went well left us in the news media I'm sorry to keep repeating myself I have a speech impediment caused by the fact that the news media is corrupt leftist in the news media love children because children can be used to exploit people's emotions and get them to give up their god-given rights protected by the Constitution about 1,300 children are killed by guns in the US every year which is less than half the number of children killed by abortion in the US every single day let me repeat that about 1,300 children are killed by guns each year while 3,000 children are killed by abortion every day now my point is not that the children killed by guns have at least some small chance to fight back or escape all the children killed by abortion or utterly helpless my point is not that the children endangered by guns can protest and take political action all the children killed by abortion have no voice and no vote my point is not that gun organizations like the NRA want more people to be able to defend themselves while abortion organizations like Planned Parenthood ghoulishly sell the body parts of the children they slaughter while the news media looks on with approved oh wait those actually are my points also that the left and the news media killed babies and then use children to attack your god-given freedoms yeah those are pretty much my points trigger warning I'm Andrew Clavin and this is the Andrew Clavin show all right DC McAllister is gonna be with us she is an excellent writer on social issues I want to talk to her about

the life insurance it would all be over you know why the left the left is doing this whole thing where they're using the traumatized children from the school shooting in Florida and for all I know other know CNN is gonna hold a town hall I mean it's it's despicable let's face it because because they're trauma is touching but it has nothing to do with whether they know anything about what would help curtail shootings it has nothing to do with anything except to manipulate your emotions to get take away your second Amendment rights that's the only reason they're doing it I mean they're not bringing on children who say like no we defend gun rights that's not gonna happen it's all about the children and it's all about show and the news media is just in on it they're just that that's how corrupt they are you know why they left always use children they you know whatever you do you say like well people you know we have the right to have guns so we can defend ourselves against an encroach the encroachment of government you know oppression and they say but what about the children you know you say well people you know yes that might be a good government program but I have the right to keep my money and decide how I should spend it myself what about the children you know you say whatever we should we should be able to defend our borders oh but look at the little children who came over and we don't want to say you know it's the dreamers the dreamers all came back the reason they use children is because we all agree the children are not free agents and they need protection and what the left wants to do is they want everybody to envision himself as a children like that Obama video of the life of Julia Obama's gonna take care of you from cradle to grave cuz you're a child and the government is the big adult and we all agree that some of the things that the left wants to do apply to children nobody wants to see 7 year olds go in and buy a gun nobody wants that so they're they're basically extrapolating all the time to make all of us feel like children and of course children touch our emotions because we feel protective toward them and what they're saying is don't you want the government to do that what they don't understand it's always about premises everything is about premises everything is about making people establish their premise our premise conservative premise Americans premise is freedom we start with freedom and the thing is this is the way arguments take place in this country there's a crisis there's a tragedy there's something that will cut it touch your emotions remember what the left always says no good crisis should go to waste that's what they always say what they mean is no good crisis should pass without they're manipulating it to increase their power over your life right and so what we are saying is we want to be free so they come and say well look there's a terrible crisis and we can fix it what we're saying wait we want to be free and when we have CNN praising North Korea we know it's only a little while before CNN shows up at our house and wants to turn our house into North Korea we need our guns these are not people we want to allow to come anywhere near us unless we have guns to protect ourselves and protect our freedoms I know I know that some government programs make life better I know the government programs occasionally will do things that you know other people can't do but do they encroach on your freedom and do I want to trade my freedom bit by bit for each little thing that they do well no I do not if you made my life you know I tried to explain this to somebody at the prayer breakfast it was really tough I said if you made my life perfect but I had no choice I couldn't make my own choices about my life I would prefer to take the dangers take the risks take the flaws in order to be free why because freedom is where the meaning of life comes from you do not have that life has no meaning if you are not making choices and that's why they get to say we're evil because they say oh here's the thing that would fix this here is program a that would give me in Washington all the power take the power away from you but it would fix this we say no thank you we'll keep the freedom oh you don't want to fix that you're so mean you're so mean you as a you know limit let us take a trip just to watch the way these guys argue and watch the way they talk let us take a trip to knuckle head row the op-ed page or the New York Times on knucklehead row there is no greater knucklehead than Paul Krugman I think other knuckleheads are simply aspiring knuckleheads to the knucklehead King Paul Krugman virtually everything he says is untrue today he unleashes on the GOP saying they have no character Republicans stink everything about them is awful the modern GOP is to an extent never before seen in American history a party built around bad faith around pretending that his concerns and goals are very different from what they really are flag waving claims of patriotism pious invocations of morality stern warnings about fiscal probity are all cover stories for an underlying agenda mainly concerned with making plutocrats even richer that's what I want I want plutocrats be because why would I want that why would I want that why were the people who vote for Donald Trump go out there to make plutocrats richer that is insane doesn't matter let's let us go on with the knucklehead Paul Krugman and the character flaws of the party end up being echoed by the character flaws of its most prominent members are they bad people who chose their political affiliation because it's their proclivities or potentially good people corrupted by the company they keep probably some of both in it they love you the left this is why we want to give up our guns because they love us so much we don't have to fear them in any case let's be clear America in 2018 is not a place where we can disagree without being disagreeable where there are good people and good ideas on both sides it's not a place where there are good ideas and good people on both sides or whatever other bipartisan homily you want to recite we are instead leaving in living in a caki stock ricean nation ruled by the worse and we need to face up to that unpleasant reality that's what Paul Krugman thinks about you but the thing is this is what he thinks about anybody who disagrees with him you know I was looking around for information on my own I stumbled on a several years old article by a woman named Carol Markowitz from The Daily Beast now The Daily Beast as I recall is actually a left-wing thing right yeah here Carol Markowitz his convention was called one of the worst ever Chris Matthews deemed him dangerous and scary Ellen DeGeneres said if you're a woman you should be very scared his opponent ran an against him portraying him as uniquely dangerous for women I've never felt this way before but it's a scary time to be a woman said a woman in the ad he was frequently called a bully anti-immigrant racist stupid and unfit to be President who was it MIT Romney that's right MIT Romney one of the nicest people who ever ran for president I didn't agree with a lot of what he said I don't think he ran a particularly good campaign but there was no getting around the fact that he was a noble decent honorable human being who did things for his neighbors who did things for anybody he could help a New Republic article this is still quoting from The Daily Beast proclaimed yes Romney's vision for America really is that scary The Huffington Post headline read the severe danger of a Romney presidency Rolling Stone explained why president Romney would be a disaster for women and Nick Kristof in the New York Times pontificated on how Romney would treat women spoiler alert not well Mitt Romney was of course far from the first Republican presidential candidate to get this treatment george w bush john mccain and any Republican who has the audacity to challenge a Democrat for the presidency are treated to evermore alarmist rhetoric every gaffe every uncorroborated story is blown up by a media seemingly unaware of its extreme bias this is from The Daily Beast lest you imagine all presidential candidates get this kind of media treatment well not quite Barack Obama wasn't stupid when he said there were 57 states he wasn't racist when he listened to pastor Jeremiah Wright's sermons for 20 years he wasn't insane when he said he would lower the oceans he wasn't unfit when he said he would end the Iraq war on the very day he took office he continually got the benefit of the doubt the Republicans never get from the press and she goes on to quote who do you think Paul Krugman as flinging every insult he has got in his book against Mitt Romney and George W Bush this is and the thing is they don't understand what they don't understand is our argument is not that our guys are good I mean nobody picks on Republican politicians like Republicans our argument is not that Donald Trump is a good person it never has been our argument is that you leftists are so much worse and your protect bad traits affect our freedoms in waves that Donald Trump's don't it's a binary system we got to choose one or the other we choose the bad guy who will keep our freedoms rather than your bad guys who will go up against them you know one of the things you want to do in the in the short month of February and also as the year still kind of a beginning of the year you still got your resolutions in place you want to get in shape and the whole thing about getting shape especially in LA I'll tell you especially in Los Angeles is getting to the place where you work out

these Russian indictments the 13 people I think another guy and some minor guy was also a charge today and the left is trying to push this as a big deal now it seems to me obviously I think it's a bad thing for the Russians to manipulate sagessa law they shouldn't manipulate our elections but just doesn't seem like a very big thing and and we know we know that no matter what they did you can't really rig an American election we know we have an expert on this this is a cut number ten there is no serious person out there who would suggest somehow that you could even you could even rig America's elections there's no evidence that that has happened in the past or that there are instances in which that will happen this time and so I invited mr. Trump to stop whinin and go try to make his case to get votes you know it's funny is I put this in our cut sheets and our sound sheet and then Trump started tweeting it out it's like he was reading my mind he started tweeting this out now just to go back and remind us that from the beginning Hillary's told us that it was awful what did she say was I can't remember the word she used was something some horrible word outrages dreadful something for Trump to say that he might not accept the outcome of the election because he felt that press was so much against him and he wanted to see how it went and he knew the Democrats cheat which they do but Hillary said that's awful and she swore she would accept the election results it's cut won are you willing to accept the outcome as the will of a voter Secretary Clinton I support our democracy and sometimes you win sometimes you lose but I certainly will support the outcome of this election and I know Donald's trying very hard to plant doubts about it but I hope the people out there understand this elections really up to you it's not about us so much as it is about you and your family uh and then after she lost and had a started hitting the Chardonnay not so much cut to but I was on the way to winning until the combination of Jim Comey's letter on October 28 and Russian WikiLeaks raised doubts in the minds of people who were inclined to vote for me but got scared off and the evidence for that intervening event is I think compelling persuasive so now what what the point that I'm trying to make is the same point I was just making about Paul Krugman is they will say anything and they say it all the time and the exceptional nature of Donald Trump even though he isn't outlandish about you know an outsized character who does a lot of things that people have not done in the office before it is not they have been screaming wolf all this time and they will say anything they will say anything here's a chart here's a child let me hold up this child there's a dead child I'll hold up a dead job Jim Carrey was posting pictures of children who had been shot you know they're trying to convince me they will say anything so now they come out and they they indict these 13 guys indictments that will never be proved these people will never be tried they're back safely in Russia so it's just an indictment but even the assistant the Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein is saying this did not affect the election and he's saying there's no evidence so far it's you know obviously the investigation goes on he says there's no evidence that Trump was involved just play that second clip of him there is no allegation in this indictment that any American was a knowing participant in this illegal activity there is no allegation in the indictment that the charged conduct altered the outcome of the 2016 election when I caution you that everyone charged with a crime is presumed innocent unless and until proven guilty and now now I want you to you to look at this is a beautiful beautiful cut this is absolutely perfect on how narrative is constructed this is Karen Tumulty of the Washington Post talking to potato Brian Potato Head Stelter at CNN and she goes over the top on describing this and then Stelter says oh boy now look at you now you said this in Fox News is going to attack you for it as if the fact that it were Fox News immediately makes the attack irrelevant not worthwhile just listen to the way this plays out you look at the president's tweets this morning and try to imagine if Franklin D Roosevelt after Pearl Harbor had gotten on the radio and said that Tokyo was laughing at us to use a little less crude phrase than he did that is not what is called upon yeah a president to do right now you know what's gonna happen though Karen someone on Fox News is going to take what you just said they're gonna say how do you compare this to Pearl Harbor it is an attack on our country it is an attack on our country with use of 21st century means and it is definitely a national security threat which is something that the commander-in-chief is supposed to be dealing with so it's like don't tell the truth about us while we're busy lying you know it's like G Tucker Carlson actually went out and said this is absurd and they said it was just like brian Stelter said he called her out for calling it pearl harbor she called it Pearl Harbor before he said it she called it Pearl Harbor again after he said it Fox News is right and what brian Stelter doesn't what they always do is they demonize the opposition that's Fox News Fox News said it Fox News said to into his floor are you gonna believe two and two is four Fox News said it this is the way they construct narrative and it's all about narrative with them it's not none of it is about the facts so what are the Russians doing what were the Russians doing they were staging rallies for and against Donald Trump for him when they thought he wasn't gonna get elected and for Bernie Sanders when they thought he wasn't gonna get elected just to undermine the woman they thought was going to get elected Hillary and after Trump get it got elected they start staging rallies against Donald Trump they just wanted they just want to cause as much trouble as they can let's take a look at one of those he's in New York right the thing is the Russians were so incompetent they all they could get were like a couple of hundred people to show up for a rally against Donald Trump I mean after all with the left ginning up everybody you think thousands of people but the Russians could only get a few hundred but that's okay because MSNBC and CNN were there to cover it with incredible sympathy who's cut number eight NBC's Morgan Radford is at Union Square in New York City that is where the anti-trump protest is just about to kick off and Morgan with a good day to you what's happening there right now well it's already started in fact you can see hundreds of people behind me here in Union Square I want to show you some of the signs and the posters they're holding up here you can see one here that says knowledge Trump's hate protect our public schools teachers against Trump you see people that are really saying that this is the time for them to come together they're trying to say they're being more inclusive and that's because thousands of people as you know now so feeling marginalized by president elect Donald Trump's comments they said this is a love rally that's after they pointed in that direction they yelled were not going to be tolerating any sexism or homophobia or racism and that is really the message all of sort of these protesters coming together frustrated angry and all directed at the president-elect hey Morgan can you tell who has organized this rally it has been suggested that so many of the protests across this country have been impromptu rallies I mean it's been supported by a very diverse array of constituents is there someone in charge here right now this is a lots of different groups of people who have come together with no necessarily official leader yeah it was Boris badenov loud Amir Putin was in charge I mean they're so sympathetic an you spot the difference between CNN MSNBC and Vladimir Putin there's no space between them and now we hear that Russian you bots that they use to send out as much information as they can have immediately jumped on the gun debate and are immediately you know trying to divide people on this very difficult issue because there's emotions on both sides as powerful arguments that there's not that many parts for banning guns but there are powerful arguments on both sides and I just want to play this one cut because as I usually don't pick on MSNBC because they're openly left-wing and I think that's fair it's CNN that pretends to be a news station but is a left-wing propaganda outfit it's NBC that pretends to be a news station but as a left-wing propaganda outfit those are the guys I go after but I just want to show you Chris Matthews coaxing this kid coaching this kid on-air to get him to say what he wants to say in order to manipulate your emotions you know when you're up against the power of the gun lobby the NRA they want guns basically available to anyone open carry in Florida eighteen year old you can buy an ar-15 an assault rifle they basically went as free an availability as guns as possible in this universe more free that anywhere in the world they want to make it easy to get a gun and carry a gun and openly display it they are all the way with this thing you're up against that yeah you know it's absolutely disgusting how how easy it is to access you know these assault weapons no other country in the world this is it's not easy like it is in America and of course America has constant mass shootings it seems to be like a daily thing now but you know we know what we're up against the NRA has consolidated a lot of power they have a lot of politicians in their back pocket but as long as politicians continue to get money from the NRA we're gonna vote them out so they're gonna get what's coming to them you know my point is not that the Russians and the news media both have the same goals of spreading disinformation in this court oh wait that's exactly my point I just want you to imagine for one minute what if the New York Times really did have all the news that was fit to print what if CNN really could be the most trusted name in news what if after the debacle of their coverage of the Obama administration has corrupt administration their attempts to cover-up Obama gait his misuse of power what if they reformed themselves what if they started trying to tell the news straight up both sides of the opinion all the facts they could get their hands on just delivering the news as it came in instead of manipulating our emotions the Russians would have no power the Russians could come in here and spread disinformation all they wanted but we would know that we could go to our news media and get trustworthy information it's them it is them they are the ones who caused this problem the Russians would be helpless if they weren't such corrupt liars all right we got DC McAllister coming up we got to say goodbye to Facebook and YouTube come on over to the Daily wire.com and you can listen or subscribe you could watch the whole thing right there and if you subscribe for a year you get the leftist tears mug it automatically fills up every time I speak DC McCallister Denise McCallister is a senior contributor at the Federalist also a contributor at PJ Media like me she writes about Donald Trump feminism me too and more she's also a strong proponent for the pro-life movement and acts as a speaker advocating for the rights of the unborn children she has been around a lot she doesn't get enough attention she's an excellent writer really interesting writer it's good to see if you see it's been a long time I haven't seen you since that Ricochet gathering I think I'm crumbling slowly it's myself together for 45 minutes at a time and then they turn off the cameras and I just go out now I was the thing I want to talk about before we get start talking about the state of play between the sexes is one of the things that is fascinating about you is your life and the place that you're coming from now when you and I met I seem to remember that you have something like 77 children is that right you have like a 112 children we raise them all okay all right so you've raised example you raise six or children that is a lot you are now a very respected writer and commentator you obviously are taking care of a lot of human beings you were not always like this and I have read stories about you that are very moving that you really came to the brink I mean I remember one particular story about you're going to get an abortion can you tell tell people a little bit about your life how you got to be here when I talk to women about abortion and pro-life issues they often say to me you cannot relate to me you don't understand to struggle I'm going through how difficult it is that I don't have any support that I have nothing to look forward to and that abortion is my only option and I have to tell them I do understand yeah I was there about 17 years ago I was married and I was in the ministry actually and I got separated from my husband and during that time we were discussing getting back together I got pregnant with another man's baby and I was member of a church at the time that was very conservative very fundamental and they believed that if you divorced your spouse than you also gave him rights to your children and it was very traumatic time I was pregnant they had actually taken away my children at one point I didn't know where they were and I had two children at the time and a four-year-old and a two-year-old boy and a girl and I was devastated I had had a job I lost my job I lost all my friends I lost all my connections I lost my children and here I was pregnant and I just thought I said like parking lot one day of the abortion center it was really hot and one memory I have of it is french fries in the car anyone with kids knows what that's like the french fries in the car and that kind of smell and it just brought tears to my eyes it reminded me of good times with my children and how I wanted just everything to be normal again and I think that's how a lot of women are when they get pregnant they get new situations they just want it easy then when it normal they want happy times again and this pregnancy is disrupted everything and I wanted my children back I wanted my life back when my church back my job everything could be fixed if I just killed my child and yeah I went into the abortion clinic there are two girls there ahead of me and I just remember the woman at the desk it can I help you and I was like me actually you can't no you can't help me there's only one person that can help me and that's my Savior and I could not shed the blood of my daughter you know blood had already been shed for what I had done and by God's grace I was able to move forward to have my baby it has been a difficult life I actually named her Grace and it's been a difficult it's been a struggle and there was a period of time after that that I didn't have any money I lived in this really grungy apartment with bugs on the floor I didn't have any support except for a bit from my ex-husband and some help from my parents I didn't have a job and to go find out a way to get money a church ended up helping me Animus through the support of Christian support of the church we hear a lot of bad things said about the church you know this is my story's pretty interesting cuz I had a bad rap from the church but also had the church who helped me and God is gracious and I had seventeen years later have a beautiful daughter who's given me love and happiness and life and if these let me just know the joy that can come out of suffering the hardship that can come out of very difficult situations and just the beauty and grace that can come out of just a nightmarish situation that it's an incredible story and I mean I think that just because your inner church doesn't mean the church is following the way just because they call him Lord Lord doesn't mean they do what he tells them to do and I think that so now you have come through this and now so you can stand before people and tell them about a abortion but but one of the things that you write about too is in this moment of me too you really write very forcefully about the fact that trying to get the facts of the way men and women are I want to read just a little bit of a piece that you wrote that really left out at me one of the reasons I asked you to come on during this me to thing you've said here's a little secret we have to say out loud women love the sexual interplay they experienced with men and they relish men desiring their beauty because it is part of their nature I mean that is so simple and so true obviously true and yet that has become controversial when you look at this me to movement how do you address this I know women have been mistreated I know some of these stories they tell or horrific I'm in Hollywood I know exactly how people women here what do you want to say to them about that yeah and I'm in the DC media so you know we know there's bad things that happen and we always have to make that caveat you know we do understand that women are hurt by men that these things happen and we don't want that to happen but we're not talking about that just with the meeting movement we're talking about a feminism movement that really is about coming in between the relationships of men and women it's about emasculating men calling masculinity toxic and ultimately it's about making women the victims in a press class doesn't mean that's really necessary in a culturally Marxist environment is to have an oppressed class and for women to really gain power in society with the sexism charges they need to show that they're victims and they need to have an oppressor that needs to be brought down so they can have power because feminism is not really about women it's about power we have our rights today the feminist movement really should not exist as a defender of an oppressed class because we have equality in America we have respect between the sexes generally speaking we do and but the feminist movement for power needs to press the idea in the belief that women are oppressed and that's what's coming out of the the meeting movement that's why you're getting oh he just looked at me wrong in a meeting or I felt his eyes punt me oh my gosh she asked me out he may have even like touched my hand oh you know just this you know fainting counts puritanical kind of behavior from feminists here is just me strong women coming out of the sexual revolution you're supposed to behave just like men and have you know sex just like men where did that go so but now but it is necessary because the whole sexism and feminism charge has been fading it hasn't been working not really they've tried this war on women but it doesn't always take hold not like racism does and so they really are latching on to this because we are now victims were pressed in making bring others nasty men down who have been oppressing us with the patriarchy and we will finally have our day that's why I oppose it with every fiber of my being Wow that that is I love hearing this because when I say it no exactly now now you've raised at least one daughter I don't know how many of your kids are girls a girl comes to you today and says um you know she's 12 13 and she's going out into life what do you tell her what's the advice that you would give a girl that age and I tell them you know if you're gonna have sexual tension with boys they're gonna look at you these are how boys are so one thing I have done with my daughters is explain to them who men are and be honest without them and not be afraid of them and not be afraid of that sexual tension and that it's beautiful yeah it's beautiful the dance the interaction the sexual tension you have there that that's what we're made of that's what relationships that's how love is formed and I see this attack on this relationship is really attack on our humanity and the relationships that support it but I just told him don't be afraid of that now but if a guy touches you does anything inappropriate and you know exactly as a woman we know if we're not afraid of men already if we don't have those presuppositions that he's a predator already we naturally know when a man has crossed the line from learning or you know being you know awkward rude the way men can be and we know and I said you shut him down as a you know don't run to the nearest at the word II you don't have to shut him down and power you I want my girls in power you know slap them upside the face if he's doing something to you you know that's what the heck's to you if you really have a problem do go to Authority do report it if something happens to you do not hide it come to me as your parent you know come go to someone at the church and go to it an authority so that you can report it because you don't want to be one of these women several years later her reporting things and can't prove it and no one believes them so you know if you've been violated you need to go to an authority and make sure that it's dealt with so just using my incredible powers of deduction if you have four girls we have two boys and I can't help but isn't that amazing I wasn't an English major I can still do that but if I can't help but think I mean I did not grow up in an atmosphere where people were calling me toxic where people were saying my masculinity was toxic it was rather the other way around be a man you know stand up do what you have to do which actually I found incredibly helpful I thought he gave me some very good guidance on how to behave what do you say to your sons when they're young when they're just coming into the world you know as social beings what's your advice to them understand you will respect women you will respect me you will honor them you will not take advantage of them I can't even imagine my boys doing that I can't work there they're loving to the women in their lives and you know I can't imagine the meetings I've just said you won't respect them and so they know that they know because they value their sisters they value their mothers they value femininity and you know so I have taught them that value their father has led them in that value and to show them what a man looks like you know intrigues us they're free to see how and notice may offend some people the sexual interplay between me and my husband I mean not not intimately but you know just the flirting and we're affectionate and what that is healthy looks like and the the sexual interplay between the masculinity and the femininity there and they've seen it and they aren't afraid of it they know what it looks like and hopefully they will want it in their own relationship one day and I think they do they want to have that close bonding that that complimentary relationship that is so beautiful between men and women so I tell them you know beef don't let these feminists beat you down you know be a man be strong be proud of who you are you know take care of what use your strength to actually protect women let me tell you if you want to be really defend women the best defenders of women are strong good men like ocean it's not that yeah I got it's not the younger sister but it's gonna come save you my life I've had bad man in my life dealing with me I didn't run to the girls they're weak I'm sorry I go to the men nice strong Goodman I went to my father my father is a Marine he protected me I grew up near a military town I loved strong men who are protecting me who risk their lives for me men do all the hard work they do all the nasty jobs they 99 percent of them are in debt you know dangerous jobs compared to women and you know I value that because I know myself I know as a woman I don't have the strength in order to that a man has and I can have my feminity nurtured valued and protected by a strong good man and that's what I want myself to be this is the thing that drives me crazy about the feminist feminism is the values femininity one of the great joys and comforts of the world I mean one of the things that makes the world any any good of the world is going to include that and it's just it makes me insane that they kind of knock it down and then in the name of feminism I'm running out of time I want to ask you one last question because I've noticed you've been attacked even you were even attacked on one of your own sites ricochet because you support Donald Trump and you know obviously Donald Trump has said rough things about women he said things about women that are impossible to defend he's probably he seemed like he's a billionaire who ran beauty contests we know how he was living his life and yet you defend him why why do you defend the election yeah I've experienced the whole range of how men behave toward women I mean from abuse you know to a gentleman who's treated me like a queen so I know all the in-betweens I know exactly what it looks like and I know that the behavior of Donald Trump and the things that he said I do not know what he's done the things that he has said you know are not respectful of women always but he's also said a lot of respectful things to women and from his actions he's been very respectful to some women especially in the workplace but I'm not gonna pretend that he's you know a perfect man way means I might want to defend those comments but he's also political figure he's a secular figure he is a political leader and I'm under no illusion delusion that these men are flawed deeply every president in our history has been flawed like this and that doesn't mean that she wrongs make a right but I also know this man that's not my pastor he is my president he's making civil decisions for me and not virtual decisions for me do I want him to be a good man do I want him to have good character I want him to be trustworthy now I do find him to be trustworthy as a political leader as a president as much as you can trust presidents remember the press you never really should trust them completely I'm thinking it what I'm saying you have to have some measure of confidence in them and I do and especially compared to Hillary Clinton during the election yeah and you know so I'm not gonna beat him up about things now if he's violated the law he's done something criminal we need to deal with that but no he's not my pastor he's my president and that's what I'm looking for what are you what are you doing to make our country more free our country stronger in our country you know really great again DC McAllister you are a just an amazing voice of common sense you know it's amazing it's amazing to me that things you say are controversial when they're so clearly true a senior contributor at the Federalist and excellent sight also at PJ Media where I am but it's also an excellent sight in spite of that and you can find her on Twitter at Macalester den d en Denise thank you very much I hope you'll come back again well thank you for having me it's great to be here it's good to see you all right all right sexual she's really terrific isn't she she's really something else all right that's sexual Follies no sexual follies how you want these things whoever followed that guy you know anyway sorry I'm off the topic here from the Atlantic no right-wing side sorry my Hitler invitation just broke through something sometimes just my inner Hitler just comes out the more gender equality the fewer women in stem which are the sciences a new study explores what is of course to a leftist a strange paradox in countries that empower women they women are less likely to choose math and science professions that why why do they even say that's a paradox why don't they just start with the fact though their numbers are growing only 27% of all students taking the AP Computer Science exam of the United States are female the gender gap gap only grows worse as she says maybe they should just say grows a larger from there just 18% of American computer science college degrees go to women this is the United States where many college men proudly describe themselves as feminists and girls are taught they can be anything they want to be in other words if you leave women alone they tend to go into things that deal more with relationships and more and I'll tell you something else by the way that that the most important thing that when when a woman is about 30 35 the most important thing in their life will be who she marries will be whether she's married in who she marries and and she will say that she will say it her family and that that will be the most important thing whereas guys just get very hooked on their work and they get very addicted to their work and that's what they care about they then care about things women care about people you know I mean that's obviously big generalities but just saying you know and and the thing is it's kind of a DC saying why why we're do these people these feminists any of these leftist anybody where do they get the right to dictate to you what you should want who you should be I do not understand that I do not understand why that constitutes freedom I don't understand why constitutes equality if anything if anything freedom and equality should let you be who you want including a wife and mother including a person who cares more about people than things including a person who rolls her eyes at men because and are different from you and the way men roll their eyes at women because women are different I just don't understand the entire logic of it and I think that logic has to be crushed destroyed and stomped on and then swept away with a broom not to overstate it but that I left out blowing it up than I exploding it okay all right we're tomorrow tomorrow's the mailbag come on get
