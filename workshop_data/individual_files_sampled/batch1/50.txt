it's no bigger than an office but this is the sole Baptist Church there are almost 80,000 protestant churches in the country many as small as this for the last 50 years christianity has been a big part of South Korean life along with the United States South Korea is the biggest exporter of missionaries in the world more than 10,000 South Korean preachers are active in 160 countries four million for my mine and for my pastor we're same dreaming of us to preach the gospel first and the planet church the next one is that we tried to communicate in South Korea though that message is being ignored Christianity is the major faith followed by Buddhism but young people are moving away from all religions the latest survey shows that 56 percent of the population now described themselves as non-religious I think people need someone to rely on but I usually go to my family friends and girlfriend so I don't really feel the need to be religious some believe church leaders and priests live affluent lifestyles with no financial transparency and are out of touch with modern society one good idea it seems South Korean religions have failed to maintain the moral and ethical trust of the people many especially young people have decided to leave their religions that's one of the main reasons all denominations in South Korea are wrestling with the problem of how to stop the religious decline and how to adapt to a fast changing world without sacrificing their principles and values that won't be easy but faiths are desperately searching for ways to modernize and become an important part of Korean society once again less archaic methods are being adopted including discussions and lectures in informal settings and technology is being introduced phone apps have been developed so sermons and scriptures are easily accessible and more and more modern thinking churches are using live streaming video of services Buddhism wants more popular than Christianity here has suffered the most only 15 percent of the population actively follow the faith now temples are offering temple stays for people to enjoy good food and meditation in peaceful surroundings as a way of reintroducing them to the faith they may be considered gimmicks and gadgets but it may be the last chance for faith to stop Koreans from losing their religion completely Tony Berkeley al Jazeera Seoul
