the restaurant recession it's kind of weird because in general the economy is going quite well right now restaurant should be doing well but for a lot of kind of small reasons people just aren't eating out as much i think the restaurants that are being affected the most are what's called casual dining restaurants these are the restaurants where you sit down and you have a waiter come that takes your order Applebee's Buffalo Wild Wings Ruby Tuesday is very hurt right now TJ Friday's or cherries are definitely seeing the slump here especially they just aren't seen as kind of a trendy place to go they aren't seen as anything that's really fresh and innovative right now and so a lot of people would rather do the fast food or the fast casual / sitting down in a restaurant taking the time and then also having to leave a tip and another reason that people are spending less in restaurants because non-discretionary spending has gone up for many people this is spending related to student loans and rent in technology like phone bills this is skyrocketed in recent years and it's made spending on restaurants a little bit more difficult for people to justify additionally people are eating more at home 20:16 sauce grocery prices tumble it was like one of the cheapest years for grocery prices which is making eating at home just a lot more attractive one thing that these teams are trying to do that a lot of other fast casual and fast food chains are doing as well as trying to figure out how they can benefit from automation so using machines to take the place of workers to make things more efficient they're building apps that make it easier for people to order their food ahead of time so it will be ready when they get there these apps can also enable people to pay which gives the companies information about how these people order and what their favorite meals are and encourages feedback from customers so that's a really important research tool for restaurants
