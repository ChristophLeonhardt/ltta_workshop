“Hi.
My name is Aneesh Chaganty.
I’m the co-writer and
director of ‘Searching.'"
“Hey, Margo.
Dad again."
“So the scene that
you’re watching right now
takes place early in the film.
The film is about a dad
whose daughter goes missing,
and he tries to look
for clues to find her.
The entire film takes
place on the tech devices
that we use everyday
to communicate.
That’s laptops, cell
phones, desktop computers.
Basically every single
tool that we use every day
is a tool that we use
to tell the story.
In this moment right
now he is realizing
that his daughter might
actually be in piano classes
that she goes to every Friday.
So he’s going to try and find
out how to reach her there.
The trick to kind of
tackling this movie
was basically by not
making it boring.
That was a huge thing that
we talked about all the time.
Like how do we
elevate this concept?
How do we make it feel like a
capital M movie and not just
a gimmick of a film that
was lasting for 90 minutes?
So from day one, in order
to solve that we basically
realized that what
we should be doing
is by using every single
cinematic trick that we feel
like we’ve learned, and
that has been developed
over the last 100
years, whether that’s
a camera push in, or a
dolly, or a lens flare,
or just a narrative trick.
If it was figured
out before us,
let’s apply it to this screen.
And we figured if we take
these small, mundane devices
that we use everyday to
communicate, and apply all
these cinematic
tricks to it, we
will be making
something, hopefully,
that feels like something
that you’ve never seen before.
So this particular
moment David
is finding out that his
daughter not only has not
been going to piano
classes the last few weeks,
but actually canceled
her classes months ago.
And it’s the beginning
of him realizing
that his daughter is actually
not at all the person
that he thought she was.
So he’s looking at these
messages right now.
We’re kind of panning
back and forth.
We’re punching in.
And we’re kind of mixing live
action footage and animated
footage in a way that
feels hopefully seamless
for an audience, to hopefully
give them a very, very
cinematic experience on a
platform that I don’t think
any of us, including us, the
writers and the filmmakers,
originally thought
was possible.
But it’s why we’ve made
this movie, because when
we realized we could
pull it off, we thought,
hey, wouldn’t it be a really,
really cool experience
for an audience if we did?"
