THOSE FOUNDERS JUST AREN’T AS

7
00:00:17,616 --> 00:00:18,850
SMART AS ROB REINER?

8
00:00:18,851 --> 00:00:22,954
HOW IS IT THAT STATES EACH HAVE

TWO SENATORS?

10
00:00:23,422 --> 00:00:24,656

FAILING THAT, THERE’S ALWAYS

14
00:00:29,195 --> 00:00:29,661
IMPEACHMENT.

15
00:00:29,662 --> 00:00:33,064

IMPEACHING KAVANAUGH?

18
00:00:35,501 --> 00:00:36,835
FOCUSED ON THE HERE AND NOW.

19
00:00:36,836 --> 00:00:38,203
>> YOU WON’T RULE OUT

20
00:00:38,204 --> 00:00:40,372
IMPEACHMENT.

21
00:00:40,373 --> 00:00:44,442
>> I AM MUCH MORE FOCUSED ON

22
00:00:44,443 --> 00:00:49,848
WHAT WE NEED TO DO WHICH IS GET

23
00:00:49,849 --> 00:00:50,182

25
00:00:57,023 --> 00:00:57,723
"THE NEW YORK TIMES" CLAIMING

26
00:00:57,724 --> 00:00:59,591
KAVANAUGH ON GENDER TRADERS.

27
00:00:59,592 --> 00:01:04,029
WHITE WOMEN BENEFIT FROM

28
00:01:04,030 --> 00:01:06,431
PATRIARCHY BY TRADING ON THEIR

29
00:01:06,432 --> 00:01:07,633
WHITENESS TO MONOPOLIZE

30
00:01:07,634 --> 00:01:10,035
RESOURCES FOR MUTUAL GAIN.

31
00:01:10,036 --> 00:01:13,072
WHO TALKS LIKE THAT HAS A JOB?

32
00:01:13,073 --> 00:01:16,241
THE LEFT DEVOURS ITS OWN AS RAGE

33
00:01:16,242 --> 00:01:16,675
BOTS.

34
00:01:16,676 --> 00:01:19,878
YET AS THEY SHARPEN THE

35
00:01:19,879 --> 00:01:21,847
PITCHFORKS, DEMOCRATS HAVEN’T

36
00:01:21,848 --> 00:01:22,815
DISOWNED AVENATTI WHO USE WOMEN

37
00:01:22,816 --> 00:01:24,750
AS STEPPING-STONES.

38
00:01:24,751 --> 00:01:26,852
IT SEEMS WE ARE AT AN IMPASSE

39
00:01:26,853 --> 00:01:29,455
WHICH IS FRENCH FOR NOWHERE

40
00:01:29,456 --> 00:01:29,755
GOOD.

41
00:01:29,756 --> 00:01:30,890
ONE PARTY SAYS HE MUCH BELIEVE

42
00:01:30,891 --> 00:01:31,590
ALL ALLEGATIONS AND THE OTHER

43
00:01:31,591 --> 00:01:36,329
SAYS YOU MUST PRESUME INNOCENCE.

44
00:01:36,330 --> 00:01:39,732
ON ONE SIDE ARE THESE WOMEN AND

45
00:01:39,733 --> 00:01:42,235
ON THE OTHER SIDE THIS GAME.

46
00:01:42,236 --> 00:01:43,870
WHAT IS THE SOLUTION?

47
00:01:43,871 --> 00:01:45,037
IT IS SIMPLE.

48
00:01:45,038 --> 00:01:48,674
IF DEMOCRATS PREFER BELIEF OVER

49
00:01:48,675 --> 00:01:51,844
DUE PROCESS, PUT A RING ON EDGE.

50
00:01:51,845 --> 00:01:54,080
FROM HERE AND DEMOCRATS SHOULD

51
00:01:54,081 --> 00:01:55,548
BELIEVE ANY ALLEGATION AGAINST

52
00:01:55,549 --> 00:01:57,684
THEMSELVES BECAUSE 50% OF

53
00:01:57,685 --> 00:02:00,253
BELIEVING IS BETTER THAN NONE.

54
00:02:00,254 --> 00:02:02,255
NO PROCESS, JUST PUNISHMENT.

55
00:02:02,256 --> 00:02:04,057
THE REST OF US IDIOTS WILL RELY

56
00:02:04,058 --> 00:02:05,658
ON STUPID STUFF LIKE EVIDENCE

57
00:02:05,659 --> 00:02:07,861
AND DUE PROCESS.

58
00:02:07,862 --> 00:02:10,463
MAKE SENSE, DEMOCRATS?

59
00:02:10,464 --> 00:02:12,098
THE, THE PARTY OF PITCHFORKS.

60
00:02:12,099 --> 00:02:12,866
MAYBE THEN WE’LL WILL BELIEVE

61
00:02:12,867 --> 00:02:17,671
IT’S NOT JUST POLITICS.

62
00:02:17,672 --> 00:02:20,273
DAGAN, WELCOME TO THE SHOW.

63
00:02:20,274 --> 00:02:25,879
WE SHOULD HAVE --

64
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:30,317
>> J: THIS IS WHY THEY TALK

65
00:02:30,318 --> 00:02:31,618
ABOUT IMPEACHMENT.

66
00:02:31,619 --> 00:02:34,755
THEIR AGENDA IS ANTI-TRUMP OR

67
00:02:34,756 --> 00:02:36,189
ANTIWOMAN.

68
00:02:36,190 --> 00:02:38,659
WHAT KIND OF SENATOR IS MAZIE

69
00:02:38,660 --> 00:02:39,593
HIRONO TO LET THE ANCHORMAN

70
00:02:39,594 --> 00:02:42,329
CULTURE LIKE THAT.

71
00:02:42,330 --> 00:02:50,638
>> Greg: HE WAS MAN-SPLAINING.

72
00:02:50,639 --> 00:02:52,773
>> THE DEMOCRATS ALWAYS

73
00:02:52,774 --> 00:02:58,746
OVERSTEPPED.

74
00:02:58,747 --> 00:03:02,616
WHAT THEY HAVE DONE HERE IS IT

75
00:03:02,617 --> 00:03:04,618
STRIKES EVEN MORE CLOSELY INTO

76
00:03:04,619 --> 00:03:07,421
THE CORE OF AMERICAN VALUES

77
00:03:07,422 --> 00:03:09,457
BECAUSE DUE PROCESS HAS BEEN

78
00:03:09,458 --> 00:03:12,626
THROWN OUT.

79
00:03:12,627 --> 00:03:14,829
THE IDEA OF FAIRNESS IN THIS

80
00:03:14,830 --> 00:03:15,963
COUNTRY HAS BEEN TRAMPLED ON AND

81
00:03:15,964 --> 00:03:19,066
IF YOU ARE A MAN, YOU ARE GUILTY
COUNTRY HAS BEEN TRAMPLED ON AND

82
00:03:19,067 --> 00:03:20,434
IF YOU ARE A MAN, YOU ARE GUILTYUNTIL PROVEN INNOCENT AND IF YOU

83
00:03:20,435 --> 00:03:20,435
UNTIL PROVEN INNOCENT AND IF YOU

84
00:03:20,435 --> 00:03:22,270
ARE A WOMAN, YOU JUST BETTER

85
00:03:22,271 --> 00:03:24,138
SHUT UP AND ACT AS    AS A MONOL

86
00:03:24,139 --> 00:03:24,172
SHUT UP AND ACT AS    AS A MONOT

87
00:03:24,173 --> 00:03:24,205
SHUT UP AND ACT AS    AS A MONOI

88
00:03:24,206 --> 00:03:24,872
SHUT UP AND ACT AS    AS A MONOC

89
00:03:24,873 --> 00:03:26,073
GROUP AND FOLLOW-UP THE

90
00:03:26,074 --> 00:03:27,675
DEMOCRATS TELL YOU.

91
00:03:27,676 --> 00:03:28,843
PEOPLE ARE REJECTING THAT ACROSS

92
00:03:28,844 --> 00:03:29,777
THE BOARD.

93
00:03:29,778 --> 00:03:30,978
>> Greg: JUAN, YOU LOOK AT

94
00:03:30,979 --> 00:03:33,281
NORTH DAKOTA AND SAY WHY DO THEY

95
00:03:33,282 --> 00:03:34,082
HAVE TWO SENATORS?

96
00:03:34,083 --> 00:03:36,117
YOU HAVE SAID THAT TO ME.

97
00:03:36,118 --> 00:03:39,654
I THINK IT’S A DIRECT QUOTE.

98
00:03:39,655 --> 00:03:41,723
YOU THINK THIS IS FUNDAMENTALLY

99
00:03:41,724 --> 00:03:42,156
UNFAIR, RIGHT?

100
00:03:42,157 --> 00:03:45,427
THAT EACH STATE HAS TWO SENATORS

101
00:03:45,428 --> 00:03:46,828
WHEN THEY ARE LESS POPULATED.

102
00:03:46,829 --> 00:03:48,430
>> Juan: I LIKE IT.

103
00:03:48,431 --> 00:03:49,330
WHAT I DON’T LIKE AND I THINK

104
00:03:49,331 --> 00:03:52,667
WHAT I HAVE SAID HE WAS 18% OF

105
00:03:52,668 --> 00:03:54,102
THE COUNTRY IS REPRESENTED BY

106
00:03:54,103 --> 00:03:55,236
THE MAJORITY OF THE SENATE.

107
00:03:55,237 --> 00:03:58,473
IN OTHER WORDS, 82% OF THE

108
00:03:58,474 --> 00:03:59,641
AMERICAN PEOPLE ARE NOT

109
00:03:59,642 --> 00:04:01,843
REPRESENTED BY THE MAJORITY.

110
00:04:01,844 --> 00:04:02,577
I THINK A LOT OF PEOPLE FEEL

111
00:04:02,578 --> 00:04:07,082
THIS BOILS DOWN TO TEAR ANY.

112
00:04:07,083 --> 00:04:08,683
THAT WAS THE WORD YOU WERE

113
00:04:08,684 --> 00:04:09,117
SIDING BEFORE.

114
00:04:09,118 --> 00:04:11,987
IN THIS CASE, THE PEOPLE WHO

115
00:04:11,988 --> 00:04:14,022
MOST ENJOY TALK OF IMPEACHMENT

116
00:04:14,023 --> 00:04:14,823
ARE REPUBLICANS BECAUSE IT STIRS

117
00:04:14,824 --> 00:04:16,224
UP THEIR BASE.

118
00:04:16,225 --> 00:04:17,859
THEY ARE ALWAYS TALKING ABOUT

119
00:04:17,860 --> 00:04:18,227
IT.

120
00:04:18,228 --> 00:04:19,628
LOOK AT THE LEADERSHIP ON THE

121
00:04:19,629 --> 00:04:21,897
DEMOCRATIC SIDE, SCHUMER AND

122
00:04:21,898 --> 00:04:23,031
PELOSI, THEY DON’T TALK ABOUT

123
00:04:23,032 --> 00:04:24,466
IT.

124
00:04:24,467 --> 00:04:26,869
THERE ARE SOME PEOPLE, THE LEFT

125
00:04:26,870 --> 00:04:27,603
FLANK OF THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY.

126
00:04:27,604 --> 00:04:30,639
I AM TALKING ABOUT ESPECIALLY

127
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:32,041
NEWLY ELECTED -- THEY HAVEN’T

128
00:04:32,042 --> 00:04:34,643
QUITE BEEN ELECTED YET BUT WHEN

129
00:04:34,644 --> 00:04:36,312
THERE’S ON THE DEMOCRATIC SIDE

130
00:04:36,313 --> 00:04:37,913
LIKE ALEXANDRIA OCASIO-CORTEZ,

131
00:04:37,914 --> 00:04:39,315
LISA PRESLEY, UP IN

132
00:04:39,316 --> 00:04:40,015
MASSACHUSETTS.

133
00:04:40,016 --> 00:04:41,517
THEY SAY LISTEN, IT’S TIME FOR

134
00:04:41,518 --> 00:04:46,655
THE DEMOCRATS TO BE A STRONG, AS

135
00:04:46,656 --> 00:04:48,624
CONSISTENT, AS BULLISH AS YOU

136
00:04:48,625 --> 00:04:50,226
SAW FROM MITCH MCCONNELL WHEN HE

137
00:04:50,227 --> 00:04:51,494
RAN OVER EVERYBODY, HELD THE

138
00:04:51,495 --> 00:04:54,196
SENATE SEAT -- SORRY

139
00:04:54,197 --> 00:04:57,433
SUPREME COURT SEAT OPEN.

140
00:04:57,434 --> 00:04:58,568
>> Greg: THAT IS THE NEXT

141
00:04:58,569 --> 00:04:59,769
BLOCK.

142
00:04:59,770 --> 00:05:04,040
A >> Juan: IF REPUBLICANS PLAY

143
00:05:04,041 --> 00:05:05,041
HARDBALL, THEY SAY HEY,

144
00:05:05,042 --> 00:05:08,444
DEMOCRATS, STOP BEING SO

145
00:05:08,445 --> 00:05:08,778
SQUISHY.

146
00:05:08,779 --> 00:05:11,114
>> Greg: YOU END UP WITH A

147
00:05:11,115 --> 00:05:13,616
AVENATTI WHO GOES TOO FAR AND

148
00:05:13,617 --> 00:05:16,619
DANA I BET YOU HAVE A GOOD POINT

149
00:05:16,620 --> 00:05:18,354
ABOUT WHY THE ELECTORAL COLLEGE

150
00:05:18,355 --> 00:05:18,788
IS IMPORTANT.

151
00:05:18,789 --> 00:05:22,425
IT’S A CLASSIC ARGUMENT.

152
00:05:22,426 --> 00:05:24,227
THEY WANT TO RELY ON A

153
00:05:24,228 --> 00:05:25,461
METROPOLITAN CANDIDATE AT THE

154
00:05:25,462 --> 00:05:27,230
EXPENSE OF SMALL TOWN RURAL

155
00:05:27,231 --> 00:05:29,232
AREAS, WHERE YOU ARE FROM.

156
00:05:29,233 --> 00:05:30,166
>> Dana: WYOMING HAS TWO

157
00:05:30,167 --> 00:05:34,037
SENATORS AND ONE REPRESENTATIVE

158
00:05:34,038 --> 00:05:35,372
SO I HAVE DONE A LITTLE BIT OF

159
00:05:35,373 --> 00:05:37,240
WORK ON THIS BECAUSE I KEEP

160
00:05:37,241 --> 00:05:39,609
SEEING IT POP UP OVER AND OVER

161
00:05:39,610 --> 00:05:40,677
AGAIN.

162
00:05:40,678 --> 00:05:43,313
I NOTICED IT IN THOUSAND ZERO,

163
00:05:43,314 --> 00:05:48,518
BUSH V GORE.

164
00:05:48,519 --> 00:05:49,419
ALEXANDRIA OCASIO-CORTEZ TWEETED

165
00:05:49,420 --> 00:05:51,855
THIS WEEKEND THAT THE ELECTORAL

166
00:05:51,856 --> 00:05:53,023
COLLEGE IS RACIST.

167
00:05:53,024 --> 00:05:55,025
SHE SUGGESTED THE FOUNDING

168
00:05:55,026 --> 00:05:56,059
FATHERS WANTED TO PROTECT

169
00:05:56,060 --> 00:05:57,094
SLAVERY AND THAT’S WHY THEY CAME

170
00:05:57,095 --> 00:05:58,895
UP WITH THE IDEA OF THE

171
00:05:58,896 --> 00:05:59,396
ELECTORAL COLLEGE.

172
00:05:59,397 --> 00:06:00,063
THAT’S NOT TRUE.

173
00:06:00,064 --> 00:06:03,700
THERE IS NO EVIDENCE OF THAT AT

174
00:06:03,701 --> 00:06:04,635
ALL.

175
00:06:04,636 --> 00:06:05,836
ABRAHAM LINCOLN, WHO WAS

176
00:06:05,837 --> 00:06:07,871
PRESIDENT THAT ENDED SLAVERY, HE

177
00:06:07,872 --> 00:06:09,339
DID NOT WIN THE POPULAR VOTE.

178
00:06:09,340 --> 00:06:13,243
HE GOT 37% BUT HE WON IN THE

179
00:06:13,244 --> 00:06:14,078
ELECTORAL COLLEGE.

180
00:06:14,079 --> 00:06:16,313
THANK GOODNESS FOR THE ELECTORAL

185
00:06:21,453 --> 00:06:22,219
ELIMINATE EVERY INSTITUTION THAT

186
00:06:22,220 --> 00:06:24,455
HAD ITS ROOTS IN SLAVERY, YOU

187
00:06:24,456 --> 00:06:25,656
HAVE TO ELIMINATE THE DEMOCRATIC

188
00:06:25,657 --> 00:06:26,457
PARTY.

189
00:06:26,458 --> 00:06:27,825
LOOK AT THE HISTORY OVER THERE

190
00:06:27,826 --> 00:06:30,027
ON YOUR SIDE, JUAN.

191
00:06:30,028 --> 00:06:31,062
NOT TOO GOOD.

192
00:06:31,063 --> 00:06:32,229
THE REPUBLICAN PARTY ENDED

193
00:06:32,230 --> 00:06:32,563
SLAVERY.

194
00:06:32,564 --> 00:06:33,531
>> Greg: WE SHOULD MOVE ON

195
00:06:33,532 --> 00:06:36,834
FROM THAT.

196
00:06:36,835 --> 00:06:38,102
>> Dana: IT’S TRUE THAT A LOT

197
00:06:38,103 --> 00:06:43,641
OF PEOPLE ARE MOVING TO THE

198
00:06:43,642 --> 00:06:45,343
COAST, CALIFORNIA, FLORIDA,

199
00:06:45,344 --> 00:06:47,411
TEXAS, NEW YORK, THOSE ARE BIG

200
00:06:47,412 --> 00:06:47,945
STATES.

201
00:06:47,946 --> 00:06:53,217
IT COULD CHANGE.

202
00:06:53,218 --> 00:06:54,218
NEW YORK IS SEEING POPULATIONS

203
00:06:54,219 --> 00:06:56,421
LEAVE IN DROVES BECAUSE OF

204
00:06:56,422 --> 00:06:56,721
TAXES.

205
00:06:56,722 --> 00:06:58,222
>> Jesse: THESE THINGS HAVE A

206
00:06:58,223 --> 00:06:59,057
WAY OF BALANCING OUT.

207
00:06:59,058 --> 00:07:01,259
IF YOU SAY THAT THE SENATE IS

208
00:07:01,260 --> 00:07:02,760
TYRANNY, YOU HAVE THE HOUSE.

209
00:07:02,761 --> 00:07:04,829
CHECKS AND BALANCES, THE

210
00:07:04,830 --> 00:07:06,431
WHITE HOUSE, SUPREME COURT,

211
00:07:06,432 --> 00:07:06,865
OTHER THINGS.

212
00:07:06,866 --> 00:07:10,235
JUAN IS SAYING THAT THE

213
00:07:10,236 --> 00:07:11,403
REPUBLICANS RAMMED IT HOME SO

214
00:07:11,404 --> 00:07:12,837
HARD ON THE DEMOCRATS WERE SOFT.

215
00:07:12,838 --> 00:07:14,439
I THINK THIS IS THE FIRST TIME

216
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:16,274
REPUBLICANS SHOWED UP TO A

217
00:07:16,275 --> 00:07:18,376
GUNFIGHT WITH A GUN INSTEAD OF A

218
00:07:18,377 --> 00:07:18,743
KNIFE.

219
00:07:18,744 --> 00:07:20,245
VOTERS ARE GOING TO REWARD THEM

220
00:07:20,246 --> 00:07:21,079
FOR THAT.

221
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:22,047
THE IMPEACHMENT THING, I

222
00:07:22,048 --> 00:07:23,048
COMPLETELY AGREE WITH YOU.

223
00:07:23,049 --> 00:07:25,650
IT’S GOING TO FIRE UP THE

224
00:07:25,651 --> 00:07:27,385
REPUBLICAN BASE AND THE

225
00:07:27,386 --> 00:07:28,019
DEMOCRATS LOOK CRAZY AND

226
00:07:28,020 --> 00:07:28,353
EXTREME.

227
00:07:28,354 --> 00:07:30,822
AFTER A WHILE, THE VOTERS ARE

228
00:07:30,823 --> 00:07:32,491
GOING TO SAY HEALTH CARE,

229
00:07:32,492 --> 00:07:35,460
EDUCATION COSTS, WAGES.

230
00:07:35,461 --> 00:07:37,029
WHAT IS AN IMPEACHMENT FIGHT

231
00:07:37,030 --> 00:07:38,430
OVER A SUPREME COURT JUSTICE DO

232
00:07:38,431 --> 00:07:39,264
FOR ME AT ALL.

233
00:07:39,265 --> 00:07:40,666
I THINK THE DEMOCRATS ARE GOING

234
00:07:40,667 --> 00:07:42,634
TO GET WAY CAUGHT OUT THERE NOT

235
00:07:42,635 --> 00:07:43,836
REALLY FOCUSED ON WHAT THE

236
00:07:43,837 --> 00:07:44,970
ACTUAL PEOPLE IN THIS COUNTRY

237
00:07:44,971 --> 00:07:46,038
THINK.

238
00:07:46,039 --> 00:07:48,273
THE OTHER THING IS THAT

239
00:07:48,274 --> 00:07:49,975
DEMOCRATS AND THE MEDIA LOOKED

240
00:07:49,976 --> 00:07:52,978
SO ANGRY AND HATEFUL AND

241
00:07:52,979 --> 00:07:55,581
DESPERATE AND WERE FLOUTING ALL

242
00:07:55,582 --> 00:07:56,015
THE RULES.

243
00:07:56,016 --> 00:07:58,384
THE VOTERS IN AMERICA I BELIEVE

244
00:07:58,385 --> 00:07:59,818
ARE GOING TO LOOK AND SAY IF THE

245
00:07:59,819 --> 00:08:01,320
DEMOCRATS GET POWER BACK AFTER

246
00:08:01,321 --> 00:08:03,088
THE MIDTERMS, THEY ARE GOING TO

247
00:08:03,089 --> 00:08:04,757
GO NUTS WITH IT.

248
00:08:04,758 --> 00:08:05,891
WE HAVE SEEN HOW DANGEROUS THEY

249
00:08:05,892 --> 00:08:10,229
CAN BE OUT OF POWER.

250
00:08:10,230 --> 00:08:11,163
>> Juan: SUPREME COURT

251
00:08:11,164 --> 00:08:12,031
NOMINATIONS MEAN SOMETHING.

252
00:08:12,032 --> 00:08:13,065
THEY MEAN SOMETHING IN POLITICAL

253
00:08:13,066 --> 00:08:13,633
TERMS.

254
00:08:13,634 --> 00:08:15,635
I DON’T THINK THERE’S ANY DOUBT

255
00:08:15,636 --> 00:08:17,436
PEOPLE THINK AS OF TODAY WITH

256
00:08:17,437 --> 00:08:19,505
KAVANAUGH ON THE COURT, IF YOU

257
00:08:19,506 --> 00:08:21,240
LOOK AT ABORTION RIGHTS,

258
00:08:21,241 --> 00:08:23,543
GUN-CONTROL, VOTER RIGHTS IN THE

259
00:08:23,544 --> 00:08:25,011
COUNTRY.

260
00:08:25,012 --> 00:08:26,612
THERE IS A REPUBLICAN MAJORITY,

261
00:08:26,613 --> 00:08:28,548
VERY CONSERVATIVE ON ALL THOSE

262
00:08:28,549 --> 00:08:29,816
ISSUES.

263
00:08:29,817 --> 00:08:31,250
MUCH MORE OPEN TO PUTTING, IN

264
00:08:31,251 --> 00:08:32,685
THE CASE OF ABORTION, LIMITS AND

265
00:08:32,686 --> 00:08:35,154
IN THE CASE OF VOTING RIGHTS,

266
00:08:35,155 --> 00:08:37,056
LIMITS.

267
00:08:37,057 --> 00:08:38,057
IMMIGRATION.

268
00:08:38,058 --> 00:08:40,260
WE ARE GOING TO RUBBER-STAMP ANY

269
00:08:40,260 --> 00:08:40,859
CONSERVATIVE --

270
00:08:40,861 --> 00:08:42,228
>> Dagen: MAYBE NOW THE

271
00:08:42,229 --> 00:08:43,763
DEMOCRATS HAVE TO ELECT PEOPLE

272
00:08:43,764 --> 00:08:45,832
TO LEGISLATE AND PASS LAWS

273
00:08:45,833 --> 00:08:46,599
RATHER THAN USING OUR JUDICIAL

274
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:48,501
SYSTEM TO DO IT.

275
00:08:48,502 --> 00:08:49,402
>> Juan: I DON’T THINK THAT’S

276
00:08:49,403 --> 00:08:51,838
THE ISSUE.

277
00:08:51,839 --> 00:08:54,240
>> Dagen: NOW THAT YOU HAVE A

278
00:08:54,241 --> 00:08:55,475
COURT THAT’S CONSERVATIVE,

279
00:08:55,476 --> 00:08:57,043
FOCUSED ON THE ACTUAL

280
00:08:57,044 --> 00:08:58,044
CONSTITUTION RATHER THAN MAKING

281
00:08:58,045 --> 00:09:00,180
LAWS TO THE COURT SYSTEM AND

282
00:09:00,181 --> 00:09:04,050
JUDICIAL.

283
00:09:04,051 --> 00:09:06,453
>> Juan: THEY HAD TO AMEND THE

284
00:09:06,454 --> 00:09:08,155
CONSTITUTION AND VIEW IT NOT AS

285
00:09:08,156 --> 00:09:09,456
STRICT CONSTRUCTIONIST.

286
00:09:09,457 --> 00:09:12,626
>> Dagen: I AM --

287
00:09:12,627 --> 00:09:15,028
>> Greg: DO YOU LIKE MY IDEA

288
00:09:15,029 --> 00:09:17,030
THAT THE DEMOCRATS SHOULD PUT

289
00:09:17,031 --> 00:09:19,166
THEIR MONEY WHERE THEIR MOUTH IS

290
00:09:19,167 --> 00:09:21,435
AND SUSPEND DUE PROCESS FOR

291
00:09:21,436 --> 00:09:21,802
DEMOCRATS?

292
00:09:21,803 --> 00:09:22,836
>> Juan: THIS IS SILLY.

293
00:09:22,837 --> 00:09:25,239
I CAN SEE THAT IT DELIGHTS YOU.

294
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:28,442
>> Greg: I THINK IT IS GENIUS.

295
00:09:28,443 --> 00:09:30,110
>> Juan: THIS GUY HAD HIS LIFE

296
00:09:30,111 --> 00:09:31,245
ON THE LINE?

297
00:09:31,246 --> 00:09:32,846
THIS WAS NOT ABOUT DUE PROCESS.

298
00:09:32,847 --> 00:09:34,848
THIS WAS ABOUT A TEST OF

299
00:09:34,849 --> 00:09:35,215
CHARACTER.

300
00:09:35,216 --> 00:09:37,685
>> Dana: TALK ABOUT A TEST OF

301
00:09:37,686 --> 00:09:38,285
CHARACTER.

302
00:09:38,286 --> 00:09:39,019
>> Jesse: CHARACTER

303
00:09:39,020 --> 00:09:39,653
ASSASSINATION.

304
00:09:39,654 --> 00:09:40,421
>> Dana: DEMOCRATS SAY THEY

305
00:09:40,422 --> 00:09:42,623
WANT TO BE MORE CYNICAL LIKE THE

306
00:09:42,624 --> 00:09:43,724
REPUBLICANS, I THINK THIS PAST

307
00:09:43,725 --> 00:09:45,826
FEW WEEKS HAS SHOWN THEM TO BE

308
00:09:45,827 --> 00:09:47,428
THE MOST CYNICAL, AND EXTREME OF

309
00:09:47,429 --> 00:09:48,863
WANTING TO FIGURE OUT A WAY TO

310
00:09:48,864 --> 00:09:50,931
CHANGE THE SYSTEM IN ORDER TO

311
00:09:50,932 --> 00:09:51,632
WIN.

312
00:09:51,633 --> 00:00:00,000
THEY WANT TO CHANGE THE
