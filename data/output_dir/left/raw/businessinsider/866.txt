1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,920
how long do you think it takes before

2
00:00:01,920 --> 00:00:03,750
you check the average email that comes

3
00:00:03,750 --> 00:00:05,940
in when your work you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> most people</font>

4
00:00:05,940 --> 00:00:07,319
when asked that question say a<font color="#E5E5E5"> number</font>

5
00:00:07,319 --> 00:00:09,179
like maybe five minutes maybe 10 minutes

6
00:00:09,179 --> 00:00:13,510
the answer based on data is<font color="#E5E5E5"> six seconds</font>

8
00:00:19,189 --> 00:00:21,750
so on average we check out<font color="#E5E5E5"> emails six</font>

9
00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:23,910
seconds after they<font color="#E5E5E5"> arrive which is a</font>

10
00:00:23,910 --> 00:00:25,529
<font color="#E5E5E5">staggering number now it's staggering</font>

11
00:00:25,529 --> 00:00:28,019
because when you check<font color="#E5E5E5"> your email it</font>

12
00:00:28,019 --> 00:00:30,269
takes about<font color="#E5E5E5"> 25 minutes on average for</font>

13
00:00:30,269 --> 00:00:32,070
you to get<font color="#CCCCCC"> back into the zone of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> maximum</font>

14
00:00:32,070 --> 00:00:33,780
productivity which means<font color="#E5E5E5"> that if you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font>

15
00:00:33,780 --> 00:00:35,489
writing something or you were thinking

16
00:00:35,489 --> 00:00:36,630
<font color="#CCCCCC">about something</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you were using a</font>

17
00:00:36,630 --> 00:00:39,360
creative part of your brain to come up

18
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:41,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">with some great idea if you check an</font>

19
00:00:41,010 --> 00:00:42,870
email it's going to take you 25 minutes

20
00:00:42,870 --> 00:00:44,879
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> back into that that state of</font>

21
00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:46,530
productivity you are in before<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> check</font>

22
00:00:46,530 --> 00:00:48,809
your email so the obvious<font color="#E5E5E5"> solution there</font>

23
00:00:48,809 --> 00:00:50,789
is that there should be certain times in

24
00:00:50,789 --> 00:00:52,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">the day when you check email and there</font>

25
00:00:52,620 --> 00:00:54,329
should be large periods of the day where

26
00:00:54,329 --> 00:00:56,250
your<font color="#CCCCCC"> email program is at all possible is</font>

27
00:00:56,250 --> 00:00:57,960
closed it's like going to sleep and

28
00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:00,510
being disturbed every few seconds<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

29
00:01:00,510 --> 00:01:02,039
never really get back into that<font color="#E5E5E5"> deep</font>

30
00:01:02,039 --> 00:01:04,349
sleep and you end up<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> being rested</font>

31
00:01:04,349 --> 00:01:05,519
and the same thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> happened to work</font>

32
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:07,650
overtime if you keep checking your email

33
00:01:07,650 --> 00:01:09,960
through the day people<font color="#E5E5E5"> who are very</font>

34
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:11,640
<font color="#CCCCCC">productive notice you will never get</font>
