less than a month ago it was revealed that Jared Kushner had been given close to a half a billion dollars in loans from investment firms and banks suspiciously close to the time that he met with representatives of those banks inside of the White House now his organization the Kushner organization it bears his name and his family runs it but he's not supposed to have any sort of direct dealings with that's part of the thing that's supposed to stop blatant corruption from going on inside of the White House however he got a half a billion dollars in loans and that in effect seemed at the time like some sort of performance art version of the textbook definition of corruption so we assumed that something would have to happen as a result of that right a half a billion dot we get fired up rightfully so when politicians are given checks for five thousand and twenty five thousand dollars which goes to their campaign and gets spent on their behalf but it's a little bit different than getting handed five hundred million dollars so just to break down some of the numbers Kushner's firm accepted a 184 million dollar loan from Apollo Global Management real estate division and a three hundred and twenty five million dollar loan from Citigroup both loans were made after Kushner met with top executives from each firm at the White House now you might think maybe his organization is just the best real estate company ever but we've been hearing tons of things about how they've squandered key pieces of real estate inside of New York so perhaps it has a little bit less to do with their business expertise and a little bit more to do with their access to the White House maybe we will never know now we did have reason to believe initially along the way that something could be done The Wall Street Journal reported Monday that the head of the office of government ethics informed the Democratic lawmaker that the White House was examining whether ethics rules or criminal laws were broken and Kushner's dealings that is a ridiculous sentence how could that possibly not involve at the very least breaking of ethics rules if not the actual letter of the law that said we now find out that perhaps the White House isn't going to do anything and so we will turn to Sarah Huckabee Sanders Jared Kushner said yesterday that the White House Council had conducted an investigation into loans given by companies executives you've met with they clear them said no wishes work off you confirm that that there was an investigation and that the council's office cleared those ones while the White House counsel's office does follow up with staff to assist with compliance with various ethic standards is not probing whether Jared Kushner violated the law the White House indicated to OGE that we are aware of news reports and would proceed as appropriate beyond that we do not and will not have any further comment that is a Sarah Huckabee Sanders that does not want to be talking about this we do not and will not have any further comment about the fact that he got a half a billion dollars in loan I say it over and over because it's ridiculous I mean we have a lot of instances of political corruption that we've dealt with and I like to think that it's usually between the fifty thousand to three million dollar range or something I can't really get my head around a half a billion dollars historically we have had a huge issue in this country with administrations in power who refuse to use the power that they have to bring evildoers to justice right to go after the rich and powerful who have taken advantage of Americans who have destroyed the economy who have done terrible things who have broken laws we've been frustrated and angry with previous administrations for refusing to take real action but here's the issue the evildoers are in the administration so what would make anyone think that there would be a proper investigation into that gigantic loan that Kushner got you actually were inaccurate in presenting this story not in the facts not in the facts of the story you were inaccurate in thinking that we were assuming that there would be any justice in this in this case let me be clear about something in regard to this story this is gonna sound salty and bitter but it is what it is okay we get what we get okay it was clear from the very beginning that there would be conflicts of interest we talked about this over and over and over again and guess what the American people didn't care the conflicts of interest barely even made it in the new cycle so the conflicts of interest exist he's still involved in those businesses Trump still involved in his businesses those conflicts of interests didn't magically disappear go away these are people in positions of power who will now use those positions of power for their own advantage for their own profits for their own businesses it's not about the American people it's not about representing us or looking out for us that's why for the billionth time these conflicts of interests served as a huge disadvantage to the American people and will continue to do so as long as this administration is in power well two points one is that the other group that is supposed to hold the executive branch responsible is also bought and paid for and getting everything they want from the executive branch and that's Congress so as long as you have Republican control of Congress you will have no real ethical investigations into what Ann is talking about what John referred to it that you're just not gonna have it because that's the that's the stopgap that's the that's the lifeguard on duty and it's all GOP so they frankly have no interest in creating issues for the executive branch at this I mean look up I believe that there are potentially serious issues with Russia okay Congress has no problem investigating Russia Democrats in Congress want to investigate Russia which is fine I think that's fine but why is it that they're not aggressively going after some of these financial conflicts of interests why are they not going after clear cases of corruption I mean that's the kind of stuff that we should be hearing about all day every day on cable news but we don't hear about that you see what I'm saying well did this story back when when it was breaking what was covered maybe III believe it was multiple days but now I believe it is well I do watch it to still be being talked about and trust me I have then Russia because this actually has immediate ramifications for our country well I would say even if it was here's the thing about CNN and all those that they got 24 hours a day all sorts of stuff and they should be able to cover at least three things I'm very pleased let's say three anything maybe after a couple weeks four but start off with throat it's just widely understood to be a guy who's in way over his head from the standpoint of government and he's a guy who's can be played and foreign governments it's been documented Washington posted a piece on New York Times did a piece on it and so on and so on and so on yeah the fact that Jared Kushner is being played by every foreign government and as it turns out it turns out by by big banks control but remember this of what part of this half a billion dollars is associated with that Qatari loan but he couldn't get an the Qatari shut down on him and then remember all this stuff happened within like a week of the meetings at the White House then he got that money and then he started speaking out and started leaning on the Qataris so he's it's it's pay to play here yeah and it's coming right in the front doors and it says there is work there's a kind of corruption we're used to seeing in Washington which is all the ways that guys usually get payoffs and payoffs into their reelection campaign and all the rest but this money is coming right in the front door and they're paying for access to the president exactly yeah and that the the numbers are just exponentially higher the shamelessness is if you could somehow map it out to a number is exponentially worse and it's just brazen it's so pretty it's so brazen you saw it in Sarah Kobe said look I know as much as anyone else that for the past 14 or 15 months waking up every day it is it is a pummeling to your brain looking at this news and honestly investigating every story and caring about every story takes a toll on you psychically and psychologically and I understand that that is difficult and when that sort of cognitive load is placed on you some people check out and some people want to simplify things and so there's this idea that some people spread from time to time on certain topics that it's all the same and the parties are the same and the administration's are the same because that's far as simpler on a day to day basis to believe than to actually see things how things defer but in the past where there's corruption there can at least be an attempt at a cover-up there can certainly be people who are fired as a result of it that did occasionally happen in the past we're talking about something so much more blatant and so you do have to stay tuned into a whole bunch of different things and it is complicated and I don't know if this is the sort of story that you can explain to people in a way that will motivate their political behavior or their voting decisions come November or anything like that but this is so epic that it should I agree with you Anna it should be one of the biggest stories it's the very least for a month or six weeks and and by the way why do you think Citigroup wants access to the president why do you regulation they want more deregulation and they're getting it and they're getting it so yeah I get it it's not a sexy story it's not you know whatever stormy Daniels or Stephanie Clifford talking about rolling up a magazine and spanking Trump with it and it's not salacious at all but it still matters it matters and it impacts our lives way more than a ton of the crap that you're seeing on mainstream media right now and I that that gives me a solution if we could just Photoshop Jared Kushner spanking the Citigroup CEO maybe people wanted to in that but you know a clue to this came early on before Donald Trump as president said and as we've documented many times we all knew that there was gonna be incredible conflict of interest these guys weren't gonna divest they weren't gonna set up any blind trust but none of that was gonna happen but when Trump didn't release his taxes and we all knew his taxes might have been under audit although I don't think so I'm really calling BS on that and we never saw any real documentation on a federal level that was would have backed that up but when he didn't release it everyone was so shocked and there well he will how can he do this that was the first sign no no it's so what I didn't yeah you know what are you gonna do about it so what I didn't divest myself of these companies Trump is still a part of his companies so what what are you gonna do about it they come from the world of real estate moguls that's a world of denial it's a rule it's a world awash in money there is money laundering and all I'm talking about the corrupt ones but there's certainly signs here that these guys don't play it straight the Kushner company I mean there are people in the Kushner company who have been under indictment over things involving questionable real estate in prison exactly come on so in a sense as a family tradition I would like to see continued in the future we're both shocked and not surprised exactly yeah and I saw recently the author of a book called how democracies die who has studied around the world how countries that were democratic fell into autocracy in various forms he says now that this is not the sort of thing where when you cast off these norms that are not codified in law or any sort of regulation are just things that we've agreed on as a society you do not often get them back and that is the scary thing for me that these ideas that we can simply weather this storm and then everything is gonna be amazing after or will a virgin emerge into Candyland in two or four years there is historical precedent to believe that that is not actually going to be the case so we have to fight to make sure that it is actually the case you just watch the video by the young turks the home of the revolution if you'd like to get the full show come join us and become a member tea white tea
