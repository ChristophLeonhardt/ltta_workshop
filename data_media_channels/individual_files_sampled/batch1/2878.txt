I didn't realize it was two patties whoa so I guess there's three layers of bread here I honestly didn't realize it has three pieces of bread I did not know that it had an extra piece of bun I probably eat at McDonald's once every four or five months I may be a McDonald's three or four times in my life I never eat at McDonald's especially after I watched Super Size Me I never recovered from that whenever I want fast food my favorite fast food is Taco Bell I like chick-fil-a I go to Wendy's or now that I'm in New York I definitely go to Shake Shack Chipotle is my number one fast food I eat Chipotle more than I should here's the box it's actually bigger than I would have thought but I guess it's named that for a reason looks like two burgers stacked on top of each other which I guess is very American get a good grip on this three piece of bread thing what's really good it's good I like it a lot hmm mmm the burgers really bland the sauce is kind of good I'm like it's okay I was scared that it was gonna be too much to bite into with the two patties and the three buns taste I'm really tasting our lettuce and the sauce is there like horseradish in there I don't know it is better than I expected tastes like there's some salad dressing on it maybe the beef is a little spongy falling apart a little bit I don't see what the third piece of bread is for um I don't think I need the extra piece of bread this is like their big thing right at McDonald's not the Nuggets if I want a burger I want a big juicy half tongue burger not like a it didn't taste gross I I think I kind of imagined McDonald's is gross I would never order the Big Mac for McDonald's yeah I don't need to eat this ever again maybe now that I know I like this one it would be a go-to item I would go for a Shake Shack burger over this any day
