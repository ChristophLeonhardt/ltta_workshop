Michael Stetson burger you're a local journalist yeah I mean Angie and you're hugely active in helping people to wake up that's how I would describe you that's a perfect description yeah yeah and how would you describe what you do on a daily basis on a weekly basis what's your motivation what's your aim my aim is to inform the people about Islam I'm writing articles for Internet block politically incorrect I'm making videos as well like you I'm interviewing people and we make public rallies to inform the people because not many people know exactly about Islam it's a really big danger but all the mainstream media all the mainstream politicians say oh Islam is a religion of peace only extremists abuse this peaceful religion and this is not true and the reason I heard your name through friends the reason other people may know you people may know your name Michael stewartson burger they may have read about you what was the big thing why is it that your name is kind of known because you were punished for posting a photo correct if you let people know about that whole saga yeah that was a really big scandal last year I made an article about the Nazi Islam alliance in the Hitler area and I posted a picture a historical picture of a Nazi and he had his Nazi armband Nazi armband the swastika and he was shaking hands with a gross Mufti of Jerusalem I mean arou see the Grand Mufti Jerusalem and this is a picture it says though anyone can go google it now I googled it before yeah you didn't did you change the picture did you doctor the picture did you do anything to the picture to make it something that you that you changed I made and used the original picture and I said it on Facebook and I made some sentences yeah this is Nazi Islam pact and that Islam is an fascist ideology made Hamid up there Samet with his book Islamic fascism clear and then I set the link on article of P I news where I made a long article with a lot of photos a lot of informations so the accuse was that I posted it on Facebook and the church set a charge yeah and the church said there was a female charge she said okay and it it's not an article and journalistic articles or an article about historic event it's just blaming Islam so so this was so you posted it up there on Facebook it was a photo that is out there available for everybody and it went to court you were taken to court and a judge said it wasn't journalistic it was kind of hate speech I'm guessing yeah the church said it's if you say Islam is a fascist ideology it's HP hate speech it's blaming a world religion and and ii was using of this swastika is forbidden yeah and that was on the picture yeah and I said look I'm a journalist and journalists are allowed to use historical pictures if they writing articles about historical events but this church she was you know like like Europe she's she said oh you're blaming Islam and now you're sentenced six months to prison three years on probation so she wanted that I stopped my work informing people I should be silent for three years so this is against freedom of speech against information about the danger of Islam and yeah this trial it was you know it went around the world so that white people will know you because you're the guy who got sentenced to six months in prison for posting a historical picture on Facebook what happened next you didn't go to prison no no we made a second trial yes of course we'd be healed we appealed yeah and it was just three months later there was the next trial and it's very unusual that is going so quick yes normally it takes one year yes but they realized yeah there was a big protest we had television reports in Poland at the best broadcasts 7 8 o clock in the evening you know there was an international protest we had in in Washington a conference where somebody of the German Embassy was there and heard it and it came international an international international issue yeah yeah so in in the in the second trial they set me free with everything yeah and the state prosecutor they didn't go to revision normally you know over the years I had a lot of experience with trials they try you know as long as they can to punish me there and and there they made no revision sure out as long as they can and I'll have to try as long as I can but there they make no revision so they realized OOP it's now dangerous for us because the public is very upset hey you are a free man I'm a free man I'm still free but I can tell you they try again to stop me there are a lot of Muslims who accuse me for blaming Islam I have every two or three month I have to go to criminal police and they are as somebody accused you for this and that so they try to silence me it's it's it's a long fight and and how do you feel about I can't I can see that you're very brave and bold and you're very are effervescence you're full of life but how does it make you feel do you ever feel like just going do you know what I give up I give up on trying to help wake German people up if they don't want to listen I give up on them how do you keep your motivation to keep up the fight I never will give up you know one of my biggest heroes is get realest and he said as long as I live as long as I am breathing I will fight and I will inform the people about the danger he's right our next hero is Robinson he is now ready to go to prison for his appreciation for his work and we have a lot of other yeah brave activists Martin Serena from Austria now we have the alternative for Germany the party here of course and they are rising up they have wonderful brilliant speakers in the parliament in the national parliament they are doing a lot of work now so I see a lot of things are going well I feel we feel made me feel the movement it's going slowly slowly step by step but it goes continually so we are on the good way and how do you feel about this silencing you know I can feel it here this idea that Merkel the media that Merkel controls the idea you can't speak out that the German security forces or intelligence services are watching you if you're an a Fe supporter they're watching you is that a fair assessment that this is a state that is closely under surveillance that you are being watched yeah they try to fight against this freedom of speech they tried to control you with everything you post on Facebook on YouTube you know I have a youtube channel since 10 years and there were 26 million spectators in the time people had watched it too at 26 million people had watched watched two thousand videos we have 28,000 people who regularly yeah and they took it away took it away and I had to fight against with a lawyer and he was successful yeah and now that the channel is again working but it's always a fight you always have to to go to court you always have to you need lawyers to to set your yeah to free you to speak we are always blocked on Facebook for 30 days but you know I'm always fighting against and most of the time we get right but now there's something I get asked a lot because people assume so I get called far right no idea why I'm assuming you get called the same probably no idea why people always think that what happens is we walk about and then people come up to us in the street and hit us or hurt us or want to attack us I don't that is not my truth the opposite is true people come up and say keep going go on how is it for you how are you able to walk around if you're such a problem and such a danger in such a threat how are you able to walk around this nice place with these nice people yeah this is here an area there you know it could be yeah there's no problems it seems yeah there there are a lot of people living here safe yeah we have here no no refugee problems no rapings it's it's a part of Munich where all the people think Oh everything is fine the Green Party is having here a lot of a lot what of support in Munich generally is very left yeah when I'm on the street sometimes people recognize me sometimes Muslims but I have to say at all my rallies I say to many Muslims who they're it's not against you now it's not against you the humans it's against the dangerous elements of Islam where if you are on our side you are against violence against killing against women discrimination so work with us roughly so and I don't get attacked on the street sometimes Muslims come hey can we make a selfie so they are a little bit fans they don't like me because I'm criticizing Islam but on the other hand have they feel a certain sympathy so I'm not in the risk of getting attacked yeah at the rally sometimes they are Muslims from Afghanistan Iraq Syria they are not there yeah they might prefer to hurt you they they they on the rallies they say I will kill you yeah sometimes they spitting at me yeah these are the the hardcore Muslims in fundamentals who come directly out of their culture yes it's different to the Muslims who are born here and raised up they are a little bit more civilized and so generally yes I I think I'm safe I don't feel that that I I'm risking my life and do you feel supportive yeah sometimes peel um you know when I'm on yeah but they don't stay long with me because they fear or maybe they could be me and about the right extremism we are identified as Islam criticizes ya foes of Islam yes enemies enemies of Islam but not right extremists you know I was working at the CSU that the big party here in Union exactly and was a press speaker of the daughter of franz josef strau√ü the big hero the leader yeah and they know that i am not right extremist i'm always warning from social National Socialism I am writing articles against them because I think they are in the same extremists I'd like left extremists ah yes the left is it's far more of a fascist kind of organization these days the far left I think yeah yeah you know National Socialism is in my opinion as well a left extremist movement yeah there are socialists a little bit different from the International Socialists the communists but it has a lot of common similarity elements similarity and the Islamic fascism these are the the big totalitarian ideologies so I'm against every one of them so I'm not a right extremist and in them the leading political party here in Ferreria CSU they are saying it officially I'm not a right extremist and yeah so I wanted to ask you specifically so in the UK we've been hearing about the mega mosque and it's a huge mosque that Angela Merkel approved in Cologne a Turkish backed mega mosque now there was an application planning application for a mega mosque here in Munich yeah can you tell us and the audience an American and other audiences actually who's who suffer with the constant building of new and ever bigger mosques what did you do about the planning for the mega mascara Munich yeah that was a plan it's some years ago it started 2010 there was an imam who wanted to build a huge mosque as you said the european center there is a massive massive you know 10,000 square meters it should cost 30 million euros and he wanted to get the money from qatar again saudi money coming into the heart of europe so a mosque that would be a Qatari mosque it would own the land and the building yeah and you know Qatar is supporting Islamic terror yeah they are very dangerous and yo we started to collect signatures against it and we collected collected 67 thousand signatures it would have been enough 30,000 but we collected the double amount because we collected three years it was a lot of work 300 public rallies so it was you know a big a big deal and but then Munich City said oh it's against religious freedom and blah blah blah and they stopped it this stops your protest let me listen also an element to this wasn't there where they talked about having a referendum on the mega mosque here yeah they talked about having a referendum to allow the people to say whether they wanted the mega mosque or not now that referendum yeah got quashed yeah they said no we're not gonna ask the people because because a lot first a lot of money is coming from the Arabian countries here you know a lot of rich Iranian people come to Munich they are shopping they are going to the medical centers yeah so it I think it's every year 50 to 100 million euros coming to the city second they don't want to have the image of Munich is against Islam no and they don't want to open it up to people because when they opened it up in a referendum to another town or city further up the road the people voted no yeah so funnily enough they said no you can't have a referendum on it because really the people will probably vote against it that's a Germany that's the point you know that they know you're in Munich that a lot of people have yeah some problems with Islam they made a study on the University of Munich and there it came out about 70% of the people I'm not feeling comfortable with Islam so they feared the referendum would be against so they asked the people but people will say the wrong thing and it's very much the feeling that I get in Germany it's don't ask the people too much don't let's don't let them talk too much because they'll say the wrong thing and the next thing is all the parties in Munich look at the growing number of Muslim voters we have 120,000 rising up and all of them all the parties make good good policy for Islam yeah Islam peaceful and and they want to get the voters so they wanted no referendum but we have seen in kevoian it was some weeks ago yes yeah yeah close to Munich they had a referendum at a referendum on earth on the megamouth on the mega mosque and the answer was no no no 60 percent against and be made two rallies in in Calverton and it was so interesting we had a lot of left counter demonstrators we had shouting masks yeah yeah you know they made a lot a lot of poor and not many people were supporting us and we thought oh maybe outwardly not many people outwardly were supporting you not many people came to us and and stood on our side or not clapping but when the election comes in the election you know when nobody can see they made the right cross on the right I know and this is the power that's a silent much I know I know and this is the hope isn't it if we're thinking of Americans you know my advice to Americans as always do not let yourself fall as we have fallen in Britain do not become UK but my hope is this feeling this sense that when they're not under spotlight when they're not on a camera when they can go into thing and write it quietly the referendum on a mess at mega moss says no we don't want to yeah yeah that's the point yeah I know so so we are very optimistic and when you translate that so to trip when you translate that to polling for the elections in just a few days time what's your sense of what will happen clearly the CSU are going to take a a knock because they fallen out of favor that's definitely you know in the last election they had 47% yes five years ago now they are at 33 30 yeah that is my Ron yeah and the AFD is around 10 till 14 so we hope it will be more when people have this private yeah when they're not allowed when they don't have to say it in public or have their friends be disapproving the same in our cities yeah there people are frightened of their friends yeah what's going on with the Green Party so the Green Party doing brilliantly well they're getting an 18% probably is it just because the people don't know what to vote so the greens are kind of a safe nice thing to do is it a sort of German thing I mean that politely yeah you know it's it's a phenomenon I many people couldn't believe how so many 18 percent in the moment would vote the green part the Green Party wants open borders yeah more migration Leatherman I mean hearts not hunted it's so crazy but you know this is this is the part of them of the public of the people which are still sleeping yeah they have to wake up they don't wake up they're living in in their left ideology they living in safe part of the cities and they sing all the greens they are good ones yes so it's that little private little center live in the wealthy parts they've got nice lives and high schools for their kids they've got access to health care yeah so let people come in let's be the nice guys let's talk about bees and the climate yeah they are on the moral you know if you say ah let them all come in we help them all men are equal you are wonderful I know you try to meet quest you know when I say when I see people on the moral high ground my view is always when I look up I can see that you're wearing no knickers yes so you're not that great yeah and we have even in the in the CSU we have people who vote now for the Queen yes yeah because they are good humans as well they don't want to be disapproved off by voting for the AFD even though they might want to stop migration so they'll say they vote green and they'll vote Greeks that make them feel better yeah yeah at the lack of courage yeah lack of courage and we have a second huge problem is the education at school there is now a survey among people under 18 horror the green party with the CSU on the same level 23 percent equally popular equally popular yeah AFD 8 percent so you can see that the young people are indoctrinated by left orientated teachers yeah and the FD maid now an answer they said every every pupil in in school who has a teacher who is talking against Ald they have to be neutral yes can you should ring a hotline I heard it on the news last night even in my German hotline and you can set it in the Internet but your teacher is showing a clear bias towards the left and American audiences Canadians British mums and dads will totally empathize with what you're saying we've met Brits that are pulling their children out of school because of the bias in schools because teachers are left wing crazies yeah yeah now one last thing I want to ask you about that you've been causing trouble you so what tell me about the Muslims praying in the street I believe that you went in and got amongst them a little bit with your with your camera that was at the end of a public rally we made in Munich at the start state has the good good place of a very known place and there are a lot of Muslims because there's a McDonald's and there are a lot of Muslims eat there because they get their drinking and everything and there there were a lot of Muslims who were shouting against our info about Islam some Muslims shouted we will kill you blah blah blah they some spirit at me and after the rally was finished they made a public prayer yeah yeah twenty on the street in a public space directly on the Stars on the big place here in Munich which is against the law show against the law they have to announce it you know this is a public street public street and a collection of people doing something together it must be announced but you know the police you know them and I filmed it because I wanted to document what's going on and the video is crashing you know it's going crazy how come people watched your video where would they go to see it they can see it on YouTube tell me where yeah yeah I have two channels on YouTube and this video is on my personal name Michael yeah and and name is Muslim speed are Muslims are praying praying illustrates I think two hundred three hundred thousand people have seen it until now and I heard that people who are not in the critical scene in in Germany they they saw the video and they send it to friends yes and and are now upset they are not Islam critic but they said they are praying in the street street public praying what's going on so so many people are waking up now they see no and this was not a praying this was demonstration test of power we are we can pray and they after after me praying if you see and they came to me go away here a Muslim from Afghanistan you know he is here as a refugee we are you know giving him a home we giving him money taking care you know like and she would be here now the controller of everything Muslims we are the slaves according to their ideology yeah they are the masters we are the slaves yeah and we shouldn't criticize Islam otherwise no I understand I've been the target offer an assassination attempt so why I really back with you yeah I was on there I was good my head was going to be used as a as a gift a wedding present from one jihadi to another so yeah so we we share well we share some similarities oh it was a video no she's in prison now and her partner is in prison but they plotted to top my head chopped off anyway moving at all I love yon surah 47 verse 3 you can read it I like your I love your enthusiasm I love your passion for this I love your positivity for this and I love the fact that you are actually saying look we welcome everybody that can be one of us that wants to join us that doesn't want to harm us yeah but though you are pointing out and waking people up I love that your mission is to wake people up I think it's so important and if you have one message now if you think about the Americans that will be watching our Canadian audiences the South Africans Australians what's your message to them from Germany they've watched you guys receive a million migrants in 2015 they see you under Merkel not that you're under miracle I wouldn't wish that on you or any man and what's your message to America to the countries that aren't yet where we are in terms of the takeover that's happening what do you say to people in other countries yeah I can say friends we are a big family yeah we are more and more people waking up in the world and we have all right on our side we have the facts we have the truth go on yeah inform people yeah connect everybody yeah and we are a worldwide community against a fascist ideology we want to set free all the countries that their people in Iran it was 40 years ago a free country yeah it was woman could walk around free like we yeah it was free and then came Islam and other countries we have 57 countries in the world and Islamic countries they were conquered by Islam with war and terror and we want to set them free we want set the people free we have 1.4 billion Muslims in the world and they could live free if Islam either would be away or Islam would say okay we are from now on only a religion we pray to a god we want to come to paradise but no violence no killing no women oppression no racism against unbelievers yeah we want we are on a historic movement to fight against a fascist ideology and we will have success of course and listeners hope is the message of course you feel the hope of course and everybody can can put a little bit to this awakening sending links of videos to friends yeah writing comments on articles in the internet yeah talking with friends colleagues yeah we can do so many things even a little little work everybody can tribute is important so we everybody everybody of us will be a part of a really big movement and we will have success definitely it's so it's so inspiring to meet someone like you Michael stood some burger don't really appreciate it you know I it started I don't know if you're waking up was started my started at 9/11 before Islam didn't bother me but when I saw the four airplanes killing 3,000 Americans I was reading the Quran and I knew from that moment on it was November 2001 that's the problem that's the problem the dangerous most dangerous book in the world and you know it's now 17 years ago we had a lot of work since that but yeah yeah still working on it but we are coming more and more to the point that more and more people waking up and you'll and your view on when you will give up when you will stop when will you when will you stop your fight when the aim is reached yeah but when we have succeeded and I'm sure the next I think the next five years will be very interesting I think in in five years we have the problem in Europe under control because there's now a new strategy political parties talk about political Islam and this is the way to talk about the problem and not to talk about religion not to talk about all we have freedom of religion no there's a political part political Islam is wants to have the power wants to make the rules and yeah claims for violence and for killing and this must be done gone must be gone so that's that lets a point and and we have huge parties in in Europe fpou in Austria strata I love him I love him I love him I was together with him 2010 in Jerusalem he is supporting Israel yes and I I was talking to him you know it's eight years ago yeah about Islam he was not so much informed but he is now now he's he said politically Islam must be forbidden he's on the right way yeah we have Italy salvini Italy salvini war got praised him here and we have Sweden Democrats we have a tenor Marcos breaking up we have yeah in France we have marine lepen we have have Eastern Europe yeah Poland and Hungary Albin you know they know about Islam they lived hundreds of years under Islamic pressure they know what's going on so many people are waking up more and more and we will America America is waking up to yeah it's a great thing Donald Trump they blame him for for what you know he is making politics for the people and he is warning what are you doing in Germany Angela Merkel is crazy we have let millions of people coming in Muslims so we're here through Bavaria they came through here I was at the train station Cathy I was at the train station about ten thousand people are weakened I was there as a reporter filming the left came police set oh sorry you're causing trouble please leave the place they in all kind of losing it ten thousand people a week through here you know that's what you face you've seen it but I've seen this very well for you the point is now the police is making the escalation so if one journalist is is causing the the trouble of left protesting motors you're the one that silent I see that go I see that it's it's it's it's a silencing a silencing of Germany they think police should say to the left accuracy Hey you go you go yeah stay civilized and not shouting and let the reporter do his work let me ask you one last question then we must finish but um on the election day what sort of results will we see will we see Merkel sister party fatally wounded will we see a surprising result for the AFD and will we see the greens hit 18 percent yeah I think the Greens will have this 18 percent I think AFD will have 15 percent well yes yeah I I am sure and Marco will be yeah fatally wounded see su-33 I think it's it's correct maybe less and it will be a problem for Merkel and we have the next elections two weeks later in Essen another part of Germany there will be a similar thing so Angela Merkel is you know back on the ropes yeah they're back on the right yeah and we have in in December have a party the CD oom is making a party Congress and there will be elections parching yes election and I think it will the next surprise then yeah so we will have Merkel down on the on a blog about counting to ten but I have to tell you Angela Merkel is the best for the AFD as long as she is doing this wrong politics more and more people can't I say and will vote for the FT sometimes it has to get worse before it can get better before it can thank you so much thank you for that all the hard work you do on behalf of many of us good fighters fighting for people to wake up we really thank you and I really love what you're doing I'm a big fan thank you very much I thank you for the interview I thank
