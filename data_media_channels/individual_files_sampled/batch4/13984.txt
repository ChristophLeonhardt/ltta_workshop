all right the flaming garbage fire that his American politics continues to flame away and Al Franken has been caught in the blaze plus we will talk about the latest with Roy Moore and Bob Menendez his jury is deadlocked so the news comes fast and furious and crappy I'm Ben Shapiro this is the Ben Shapiro show here's that shot an airplane where somebody says the bleep hits the fan and there's actually a picture of poop hitting fan and that's pretty much every day in American politics now when I say that it's a garbage fire I mean that outside this door is a raging dumpster fire and the smell just wafts through the building and that is coming directly from Washington DC and from Hollywood and it's just all garbage and everyone is garbage and that's the sort summary of today's show but there's much more so let's talk about all of the breaking news but first I want to say thank you to our sponsors over at filter by so you know you you don't think about the air quality in your home until Wednesday there's black mold on your ceiling and you're dying that's why you need to go to filter by okay at my house we hadn't thought about our filters we looked at our filters that they

no it's not like a big announcement like Trump's big announcement about his Asian tour which was basically him announcing which Chinese restaurants he'd eaten out in China it's actually a really big announcement we'll do that in just a moment but first the news so the news today Al Franken likes Graham big boobs really like this is the news today so Al Franken is now being accused by an LA anchor namely aunt Whedon she's on KBC she tweeted on Thursday morning that inspired by representative Jackie Speier a Democrat who encouraged anyone who had been victimized by a member of Congress to step forward she decided to tell her story in an essay published on KB C's website according to daily wire.com Sweden described her encounter with Al Franken the senator from Minnesota the man who is supposedly the new conscience of the Senate yesterday he was ripping up justice Don Willett the Texas Supreme Court justice Don Willett ripping him up and down because Texas justice Don Willett who is very funny on Twitter and once tweeted something about how he wanted to legalize marriage to bacon because he liked bacon so much and Al Franken thought that this was a slap at the gay community somehow which is weird because gay people aren't bacon but in any case now Frank and apparently sexually harassed slash assaulted Lea and tweeting she said in an essay she describes her encounter with Franken whom she says used comedy as an excuse to be inappropriate because comedians in Hollywood apparently are all in appropriate from louis c.k to David Letterman tweeting a former model was on her ninth tour with the USO and expected to be the event emcee but quickly discovered that Franken had penned a special skit for her to perform with him and he'd included a kiss that he insisted they practiced beforehand so here is the here is the actual essay quote he repeated that actors really need to rehearse everything and that we must practice the kiss I said okay so he would stop badgering me we did the line leading up to the kiss and then he came at me put his hand on the back of my head mashed his lips against mine and aggressively stuck his tongue in my mouth hey first of all you know that is sexual assault but I will say that every actor in Hollywood has apparently done this to every actress in Hollywood but talk to any actress in this town you'll see this is a very common occurrence this is not letting Al Franken off the hook by any means it's just to show you that in Hollywood this stuff is soup really prevalent he said I mean she says I immediately pushed him away with both of my hands against his chest and told him if he ever did that to me again I wouldn't be so nice about it the next time I walked away all I could think about was getting to a bathroom as fast as possible to rinse the taste of him out of my mouth okay she said she didn't report frankenz behavior or the alleged assaults to superiors but did her best to stay out of frankenz way the rest of the tour he repaid her she says my pepper ignore with insults and drunk devil horns on pictures she signed for the troops then on the fly home as Sweden slept in her kevlar vest and helmet she says Franken groped her while he posed for this photo yeah there is there is a senator from Minnesota groping or attempting to grope a sleeping woman just all classes is Senator Al Franken and she says I couldn't believe me I couldn't believe it he groped me without my consent while I was asleep I felt violated all over again embarrassed belittled humiliated how's there anyone grab my breasts like this and think it's funny I told my husband everything that happened and showed him the picture she claimed she was too scared to complain worried about the potential backlash and possibility that lobbing a sexual harassment allegation against a famous comedian but every percussionist sort of career which it would the way that it works in Hollywood because Hollywood is a scummy place is that if you complain about sexual harassment no one will hire you ever again this is reality and it's horrifying this is it's it's really disgusting you're considered a hard to put up with you're considered somebody who doesn't get it and isn't cool in Hollywood if you don't put up with men acting like pervs or anyone acting like a Purvis I'm gonna grow up seonyu and you say anything about it this makes you a prude in Hollywood seriously Al Franken has now responded to the allegations saying he sends his sincerest apologies and the photo was quote clearly intended to be funny oh boy he says I certainly don't remember the rehearsal for this getting the same way but I send my sincerest apologies to Leanne as to the photo was clearly intended to be funny but wasn't I shouldn't have done it Al Franken is in serious poopoo now he's in serious trouble we're about to find out whether Democrats are flaming hypocrites because they of course have been calling for Roy Moore to be expelled from the Senate if he were elected and forever Republicans distance themselves from Roy Moore the the Senate Republican from Alabama quick correction on make on the show so I keep saying for the last two days the snot has addled my brain from this cold I kept saying that Richard Burr was the senator from Alabama it's Richard Shelby of course in any case the Democrats have been calling for for Roy Moore to step down anyone who does not call for Roy Moore to step down is obviously is obviously horrifying but are they saying the same things about Al Franken well we know that several of the several of the Senators have been running away from questions about this they they've been legitimately like running from the press and that makes perfect sense because none of this matters to the you if it's a member of your own political party right it's in there's a bunch of sascha stone is is a writer over I guess Awards daily and she said sorry but if what said but but if what Al Franken is doing that photo with sexual harassment we're gonna need a bigger boat come on people snap out of it if someone did this to my wife I'd punch them in the face how's that yeah I think this is a pretty good standard right I think I think this is a good standard for sexual harassment / sexual assault if someone's did this to your wife would you punch them in the face if you're a dude or if you're a girl would you feel like you should punch them in the face if the answer is yes then it's probably I feel like that's it that's a pretty good standard so jeanne shaheen right the Democrat from New Hampshire she said quote I'm a member of the Ethics Committee so I can't comment oh-ho-ho-ho-ho so I guess this is how it's gonna go now right women Democratic women not quite standing by other women I guess I'd heard that that Gillibrand says that quote she so now Kirsten Gillibrand has said that the allegations against Franklin Franken are deeply disturbing since she believes the woman who accused him it's it's pretty astonishing stuff this is the state of American politics now so I have a proposal to fix all of this it's actually two proposals so proposal number one is that we should actually just have all the Congress people stay home I think the remote voting is the best solution to this so all of these senators should be forced to live in the districts from which they spring and live at home with their wives and their husbands this is the way that the sexual harassment would I think be minimized not because these people aren't scumbags when they're in their home district but because Washington DC is a scummy place filled with scummy people but the other way we can do this is it's time for I think robot Congress so I think we need to elect robots to Congress maybe that's a little extreme but in any case we will see whether the Democrats are giant hypocrites or whether the Democrats are not giant hypocrites in very very short order obviously some are and some aren't what's funny about this is the Democrats really don't have any risk in getting rid of Franken if they get rid of Franken the governor of Minnesota right now is Democrat still appoint a replacement probably somebody like keith ellison who is in absolute anti-semite to watch against from the more say Al Franken in the Senate politically if Al Franken is replaced so Democrats are not much to worry about by Mat Iglesias is logic yesterday at voxcom they have no excuse not to get rid of him I do also want to do this flashback because you're seeing a lot of Democrats these days talk about how the Clintons should go you know it's time for Bill Clinton to go and and now they're all hot and bothered about sexual harassment I am excited I will say this I'm excited that Roy Moore is now forcing all Democrats to be consistent about sexual harassment right this is the only reason why they're pretending to care about offering and I don't think they deeply care about Al Franken they certainly didn't care about Bill Clinton being disgusting piece of garbage until the last five minutes or so this is the last year I believe Joy Behar saying that Bill Clinton's accusers were tramps on national television I wonder if she missed the opportunity to address it in a way that the public would understand that that's just not how you behave yeah I would like to apologize to those tramps that have slept with my husband's okay so she's calling all of them tramps right this is until the last five minutes now it's believed the women believe women the only reason the Democrats are saying this of course they want Roy Moore gone the network's if you remember during the last election cycle when Donald Trump brought up all of the accusers against Bill Clinton the network's attacked Trump for having the temerity to bring up these accusers Donald Trump proving nothing is off-limits dramatically intensifying his attacks on former President Bill Clinton's history with women I looked at the New York Times are they gonna interview Juanita Broderick are they gonna interview Paula Jones are they gonna interview Kathleen Willey in one case it's about exposure in another case that's about groping and fondling and touching against the woman's will and rape and rape the rape accusation is decades old and discredited TRADOC settlements massive settlement $850,000 lots of other things they were referring to a trio of women who say Bill Clinton made unwanted sexual advances in the 80s and 90s mr. Clinton denies it two of the cases were plagued by factual discrepancies still the accusations linger and will be a focus of GOP ads against Hillary Clinton's okay so look how the media was downplaying all this until two seconds ago when Bill Clinton's dessicated political body was thrown right under that train because now it's time to get Republicans really amazing how this happened el isn't if inadvertently we end up raising our standards for politicians because everybody is so focused on getting rid of the other guy that they're forced to abide by their own standards maybe something good comes out of this maybe we actually all new standards I don't think that's what's going to happen though I think that this will be a five-minute break from from partisan politics dominating and then we'll go right back to being terrible about electing terrible people I mean remember Democrats were so insane back in the nineties over this thing that Bill Clinton who was a perjurer and a sexual molester and Bill Clinton was applauded by Democrats after he was impeached Democrats came to the White House and they gave him a standing ovation I asked the American people to move with me to go on from here the rise of other rancor to overcome the pain and division to be a repairer of the breach all of us to make this country as one America what it can and must be for our children in the new century about to dawn thank you very much there's literally after he was impeached by the house right they're all standing there clapping for him yeah the reason that I bring this up is not what about ISM I'm hung for one more to step down on Fox News yesterday I said that Roy Moore should step down on Fox and Friends right so president Trump's favorite show I said directly on that show that that Roy Moore should absolutely step down from his from his Senate run so there's not what and what about ISM only applies if you say that you're excusing Roy Moore's behavior because of Bill Clinton the reason that I'm bringing up Bill Clinton is because I believe that the standard for American politicians was set in the 1990s and that has been the consistent standard all the way until now and so if Democrats want to get rid of Roy Moore and this is gonna force them to get rid of Al Franken to good good now with all of that said I do think that we should be careful about what exactly are the standards for sexual harassment and sexual assault like we should have a picture of Al Franken you know purporting to grab a woman's breasts while she's sleeping that's a pretty bad stuff I want to make sure that the allegations that we see are credible the reason that I said that more is I mean that picture as a pig I mean come on there's a picture for you but if it but the reason that I've said that Roy Moore should step down is because the allegations are credible I went when Ted Cruz for example during his campaign was accused to have slept with a bunch of his campaign aides the allegations were not credible because there was no there are no names that were named all of the libman denied it there was not any there was not any corresponding information but there was I remember during the campaign there was a rape allegation that the media were not widely reporting against Donald Trump and because the accusers story basically fell apart pretty quickly so the allegations have to be credible but with that said you know that I think that if we're gonna if our new standard is the credible allegations are treated as we don't want these people anywhere near the levers of power I think that's a good thing maybe inadvertently we'll stumble into something better here okay so before I go any further and I do have a big announcement about my my College

application and that will allow us to get back to you faster as well okay so meanwhile while all of this is going on in the Senate the the continuing saga of Roy Moore continues apace and I want to talk about some of the solutions to Roy Moore saga but one of the things that one of the things I find really kind of gross about the way that that sexual allegations are treated its gross on on in two aspects one is that sexual allegations without any other corroborating proof if you if you say show me some corroborating evidence people go nuts and if you say there is corroborating evidence now you have to show me why it's not true people go nuts so there's no solution right Roy Morris lawyers put out a defense yesterday that was so weak and so strained and yet people are hanging their hat on this peg I remember that during the during the campaign there are some of this with regard to President Trump and I remember with Bill Clinton there was some of the same sort of stuff with regard to Trump I recall that there was an allegation that Trump had sexually assaulted a woman on a plane and people were going back and trying to figure out when the arms the armrest on that kind of a kind of plane went up or down and this was supposed to be used as proof that Trump had never done any of this I'm seeing something similar happening with with Roy Moore the question you have to ask yourself is whether these allegations are credible now you can still make the case and I'm getting letters from people in Alabama who are saying listen I'm not gonna vote for Doug Jones I don't want you to vote for Doug Jones I didn't vote for Hillary Clinton right I thought that Donald Trump was kind of ass cause I didn't vote for Hillary Clinton I'm not saying you have to vote for dog Jones I'm saying now is the time for all of you folks to be planning a write-in campaign for somebody who is not credibly accused of child molestation is that a terrible idea is that a horrible idea yeah I didn't vote at the top of the ticket I think it's possible to do that too I understand why you don't want to talk Jones in the Senate I don't want him in the Senate either I don't want a pro-abortion Democrat in the Senate but that does not mean that we got to brush off accusations that are like this so let's go through more lawyers defense because this is this is pretty bad there are a couple more allegations by the way that more groped people there to new accusers who are suggesting that more was harassing them one of them was a high school girl who said that when Moore was in his 30s he called up her high school pulled her out of trig class to ask her on a date which it like called the principal's office and said can I speak to axe and the girl went to the office and she said what's up and he said I want to ask out his hey what are you doing she said I haven't rigged class right now okay in any case Morris lawyer and let's say his legal team is not the strongest and when I say not the strongest I mean it's really quite terrible like I don't know whether he went to the his lawyers went to be my cousin mini school of lawyering but they don't have the street smarts of Joe Pesci here is in this room okay in any case here was hero's Roy Morris attorney and then at a certain point you just have to laugh at this stuff because we are so down the rabbit hole folks I mean we are we are in Alice in Wonderland and here is here is Roy Moore's lawyer yesterday trying to make excuses for Roy Moore attempting to date girls who were like 15 or 16 years old in Alabama in 1979 he's talking to a he's talking to a an anchor on MSNBC and this anchor the anchors name is Ali Velshi I guess and and watch Ali Velshi I guess has some background that he thinks that he can discern because Ali bet she's a brown person and this does not go well from Roy Moore's lawyer but point is these countries you have to do with dating a 14 year old I'm not finished with the context of it what is Ali Velshi background have to do with dating under children fourteen-year-old girls sure in other in other countries there's arrangement through parents for what we would first an eventual marriage and ours also definite but here's the answered question Ali's from Canada and Canada they have a real record of people trying to hit up 14 year olds I love that Ali's brown therefore Ali must be from a country where child marriage is the thing by the way there are countries where child marriages thing they're not civilized Western countries like my wife's grandmother was married I think when she was 13 I think the story about her is is that she went out and played jump rope at her wedding like that's not good okay like it worked out in the long run but this is why Western civilization is a superior place ok Western civilization is a wonderful place because we don't have 30 year old men who are trying to knock up fourteen-year-old girls so Moore's lawyers not doing a particularly wonderful job and then in last night that or the night before last night you remember Sean Hannity on Fox News basically gave a 24 hour ultimatum to Roy Moore and the the ultimatum was I need you to credibly show me why these accusations are false or you need to get out of the race so Roy Moore sent an open letter to Sean Hannity and the open letter is not particularly good so the open letter says dear Sean I am suffering the same treatment other Republicans of hadrons were a month prior to the general election for US Senate in Alabama I've been attacked by The Washington Post and other liberal media in a desperate attempt to smear my character and defeat my campaign and then he talks at length about how wonderful he has he repeats that he's been married for a long time and has grandkids etc etc and then he says we are on the in the process of investigating these false allegations to determine their origin and motivation for instance we had documented that the most recent accuser Beverly Nelson was a party in a divorce action before me in Etowah County Circuit Court in 1999 no motion was made for me to recuse ok so there's a problem with this particular allegation by Roy Moore which is that the actual judge who was assigned to this case was not Roy Moore Roy Moore signed I think one document at the very very end of the case she never sat in a courtroom with Roy Moore apparently in her accusations Nelson's do not mention I was the judge assigned to her in the divorce case in 1999 because he wasn't apparently a matter that apparently caused her no distress at a time those 18 years closer to the alleged assault yet 18 18 years later while talking before the cameras about the supposed a dassault she seemingly could not contain her emotions and shows my signature on the order of dismissal in the divorce case was annotated with the letters da representing the initials of my court assistant well again one of the problems is that apparently his actual court assistants of record did not have those initials at that time so very weak defense from judge Roy Moore in this letter to to Sean Hannity trying to convince him not to throw him and not to throw him overboard and then he trotted out and then he trotted out his lawyers to say that the signature in the yearbook is fraud remember we played the the tape of the signature in the yearbook the accuser showing the signature in the aerbook from Roy Moore and then his attorney said it was a fraud I'm gonna show you the tape of the attorney again I don't know where he's getting his legal team it looks like he's getting them from one of the the ambulance-chasing firms that you see advertising on television but before we get there first I wanna say thank you to this awesome new advertiser really I'm very excited about this new advertiser man crates calm like a new these these folks are awesome so this is not a cheese of the Month Club or a new tie they offer a hundred hand

awesome so man crates calm / Ben and that will let them know that we sent you as well you get five percent off of your order okay so here is the Roy Moore's lawyer saying the signature is a fraud a fraud here we go so right now trend Garmin our attorney has sent a letter or is sending a letter to Gloria Allred demanding that the yearbook be released there are a couple things that you need to look at look the 1977 after Merry Christmas look at those two sevens and then look below at the 77 and I want to ask you do you think it was written by the same person I want you to look at Old Hickory house which they say Judge Moore wrote judge Moore says there's no way in the world that's his handwriting okay so now we're gonna go into handwriting analysis which is really a pretty pretty weird form of analysis like it's always very questionable and so then just to make things worse Gloria Allred as I said before Gloria Allred is not the most credible human okay and the and the fact that Gloria Allred continues to be part of this case does not help anybody so Gloria Allred is asked okay so why don't you turn over the yearbook to some neutral third party Authority she says I'll turn over to the Senate and then she's asked is the is the allegation that this was forged real or not and she refuses tans for that question which is just granting flame to the fire which is what el Allred wants by the way the real reason that Gloria Allred is doing this is not because this is some sort of tacit admission that the yearbook is a fake okay the reason that she is doing this is because she wants the Senate hearing so she can grandstand and she's gonna do anything possible to get the Senate hearing so she can grandstand that's what's going on here with Gloria Allred we will allow all of this to be s and answered at hearings but that's not a flat denial Oh Gloria well it's all I'm saying is we're not denying we're not admitting we're not addressing we will not be distracted and we will pursue a just result for our client okay thank you gloria allred for throwing more gasoline on the flames of conspiracy theories we're gonna have Sheriff Joe Arpaio actually creates an investigatory committee after they figure out whether Obama was indeed born in Kenya and the birth certificate is a fake we're gonna find out also whether this yearbook was actually signed in Kenya by Ted Cruz's father after murdering JFK I'm very excited to find all of this out all of this is just so but but here's what's happening so because all you have to do now in order to doubt an allegation is basically throw any sort of doubt out there so now Moore is trying to turn this into in a lot of zoella's they're trying to turn this into if you don't support Roy Moore it's because you're a kook if you don't support Roy Moore because you're a weakling it's cuz you're a pansy and you just want to see the Senate seat lost I'm not the one losing the Senate seat right now dude you're the one losing the Senate seat hey the NRS SI released a poll I don't quite believe it it says the Doug Jones is up 12 points I don't think that's right but this is a much closer race than it should be Larry Sabato just moved into the lean Democrat column in a state that votes 6633 Republican so you know the only person who's losing a race here is Roy Moore not me can I want to run more out so that Republicans can win this race but in any case his supporters are out there saying that if you don't support remorse because you're a bunch of sissies you're a bunch of sissy girls here's an Alabama pastor saying just this in the name of God you're a sissy if you don't support a guy credibly accused of child molestation I was everyone all these people silent for so many decades only to all come forth at the same time now well perhaps satanically motivated but politically carried out with it's funny it's funny how the Republican Party is what a bunch of sissies the Democrats rally around their candidates even when they're guilty Republicans want to throw them under the bus on a mere accusation without going whether they're guilty or not okay Noah this is one of the arguments that I keep hearing is Democrats don't throw their people on bus they rally around them first of all we'll see what they do with Al Franken second of all just because someone else does something bad doesn't mean you should and it's not like Republicans can get away with this and the same way Democrats can you know why because we have moral standards this is one of the things I've always said about being a Democrat it's very easy to be a Democrat because when you have no moral standards in social life that means that you can get away with just about anything when you say that social standards matter that social fabric matters that morality matters of course we hold you to a different standard of course we do now I don't think that that should necessarily be the case in the everyone should be held to the same standard regardless as to whether you embrace the standard but when you do embrace the standard the added charge of hypocrisy is gonna be thrown at you when you move away from it okay so so Roy Moore himself is trying to turn this into a battle about Mitch McConnell this is something that you see Steve Benton wants to do also he you know in order to avoid the allegations I've been saying up for three days they've been trying to turn this into this is about McConnell it's not about McConnell I don't like McConnell okay I've been ripping on McConnell for years look back at everything I've written about McConnell the only thing McConnell has done right is get these judges through that's really great it really is he he held up he held up the the appointment of the of the Democrat whose name now escapes me the Democrat judge who who was appointed by by Barack Obama he held that up until the until Trump could be elected and that's how he got judge Gorsuch that was goodbye Mitch McConnell but otherwise I'm not a big big big Mitch McConnell fan but this is about McConnell but Judge Roy Moore tweeted out yesterday did as though as though Mitch McConnell the only one going after him Zera Mitch McConnell bring it on and what he neglected was the second part of the tweet is my favorite movie and I think we can we all know why it was his favorite movie actually the best squad around for years but nobody's been able to see what we can do we're in trouble but you better believe all that's gonna change is here you wanna make it right then when you go to Nationals bring it up bring it and then remorse actually in the background for some reason he was there at the filming I don't know why okay in any case in any case here are the solutions so there a bunch of options that have been presented judge more bring it on guys we had a joke about this otherwise this time is so dark and so terrible there's an article from the Babylon bee which is a Christian oriented parody site that said pull half of evangelicals say that they would vote for Satan to stop Doug Jones I think that's not entirely untrue I mean 100 percent of Democrats would vote for Satan to stop any Republican basically in any case I would like to let's lay out the options as to where we go from here none of the options are good they're really three options that are being weighed right now so option one is the Sean Hannity option so after Sean lays out this very strong case a couple of nights ago that Roy Moore has to come up with something credible or Sean's gonna call from to get out of the race Roy Moore basically offers nothing and then Sean says we'll let the people decide which is a cop-out okay like I like Sean personally I find Sean everyone who knows Sean likes Sean Sean is a really sweet solid guy but this is a cop-out okay jj-just is in my opinion so serious the people of Alabama they need to know the truth and they've got to have all the facts that they need and that means that the Alabama voters can make an educated informed inclusive decision for their state when they go to the polls and if that means whatever it means to get to the truth of it means more time I believe the governor according to Gregg Jarrett has the ability to make that decision the Alabama people deserve that Gregg Jarrett said the governor can delay the race if need be now the people of Alabama deserve to have a fair choice especially in light of the new allegations tonight now we have told you everyone's point of view the accusers continue to have an open invitation to come on this show and share their story at the end of the day I want to tell you something I lived in Alabama I enjoyed my time in Alabama and I know these people they're smart they're great Americans God family faith country and I am very confident that when everything comes out they will make the best decision for their state okay so that's a giant cop-out so I've told you listen everyone knows this is when people say people will vote how people will vote of course that's true of course that's true but I tell you what I think right I think we're way more did it and I think that you should either write in a candidate or you should not vote at all okay this is my these are my options right this is what I think you'll still do what you want to do right for an Alabama you'll do it you're you're you're a grown-up you make your own decisions but I'll give you my opinion for Sean and to basically back out of giving an opinion here I think is I do think it's it's a real cop-out I don't like heading Sean I like I like Sean but it's but it's a it's a cop-out and yeah okay so option two so the option one is let the vote happen okay and then more wins or he loses if he loses then Zell Jones takes the seat and this is a real problem for Republicans who now have 51 seats in the Senate as opposed to 52 they can't even get a tax bill through right now I'm gonna talk about that in a second okay option two would be to somehow reset the election so there are two options here in with an option to resetting the election one is the one that you saw Sean mentioned there which is the governor could theoretically delay the election very difficult to do that very difficult to see how it matter actually if you delayed the election or she sorry if she delayed the election it's very difficult to see how that would necessarily impact the election also it sets a pretty bad precedent that anytime something bad happens for the candidate of your political party you just delay the election obviously if a Democrat did that on the flip side we would be ragingly upset over it the other thing is that Mitch McConnell is is is considering a gambit so Luther strange who's the current occupant of the seat his term expires remember he was appointed to fill jeff Sessions a seat and sort of corrupt fashioned his term expires in a couple of years or rather next year I believe and therefore they are holding the special election on that basis so one of the considerations here is that if loses their strange instead of filling out the rest of his term resigns right now that triggers a new special election now that's questionable right under the 17th amendment to the Constitution the way that Senate seats are filled is that when there is a Namba that when there is a in absence of vacancy then the governor fills that and then a new election is declared so does it matter if the if the guy who filled that vacancy resigns it early not really clear for them the 17th amendment but this is the logic that maybe they can get away with it maybe they can just reset the election have a new special election the new prime and everything so the problem with this of course is that Roy Moore could very easily win those primaries and Roy what would end up happening I guess we could do this out in for an item I guess you could have Luther strange basically resigns triggering a new special election in the meantime you see the Jeff Sessions is appointed by the governor and which point Roy Moore wins the primaries at which point Jeff Sessions resigns at which point a new election is called at which point she appoints Luther strange at which point Roy more wins the primaries and we can do this forever it'll be lit just like inception will be four levels deep and Leonardo DiCaprio will be wandering around on the sand forgetting where he came from an old man filled with regret we can do any of these things I guess but I'm not sure that it's actually gonna work finally there is option three okay this is he don't seat him option so Kristin Gillibrand the Democrat from New York she says that this will be the move that if the Roy Moore were actually elected to the Senate there be an ethics hearing and then there would be a move not to seat him I think there will be a outcry of members of the Senate who do not want him to serve even if he's elected I believe these survivors I think most people do and I think it's important that he be held accountable but hopefully the people in his date will vote for someone else okay so Gillibrand my the way said she supports an investigation into the Franken allegations but she's not calling for Franken to step down so she's she wants more out but Franken Wow we'll have an ethics investigation an ethics investigation just means nothing ever happens because there are tons of ethics investigations whew and with expulsion but the question is should Republicans seat more so yesterday I said on national television I don't think they should see more and I got some blowback from that people were upset about that and even some folks who are I was talking about off the air I was talking with a couple of folks off the air who are on the show with me and they were saying well wouldn't that be disrespecting the people of Alabama's choice and my view is so what okay and I know that's the sort of harsh language but the idea here is that democracy is not the same as living in a republic and I'm gonna discuss this in the big idea in just a second listen I don't want to play with fire where everybody is now expelled it overruling the will of the people I don't think that's something that we should take lightly but I'm not taking this lightly when you have credible allegations of child molestation I don't think that that's taking it lightly I do think that the reason the founders put in place checks and balances including the ability to expel a member or not seat a member was for situations like this I do think that that exists and the big idea in a little while I'm gonna talk about the difference between living in a democracy and living in a republic and why it is that the founders were not supremely comfortable with the argument that just because the people want something that people ought to get something I'll talk about that in just a second I also want to talk about the bob menendez juried ziz is apparently deadlocked again according to CNN the jury says it is deadlocked on all charges and the defense wants to declare a mistrial it's a seven woman five man jury they say they are deadlocked and they said they were deadlocked on Monday on Thursday they said they've reviewed all the evidence slowly and they're not willing to change their positions and he still want the judge still wants them to go back to the drawing board he's facing charges of conspiracy bribery bribery and honest services fraud relating to abusing the power of his office it could carry decades in prison the prosecutors say that he accepted more than six hundred grand in political contributions at luxurious hotel suite at the Park Hyatt and Paris free rides on a private jet from wealthy ophthalmologist solomon Megan Megan in exchange for political favors including getting visas from elgin's hot girlfriends so all of that is is breaking news as well we'll talk

the nature all righty so you know I know a lot of people aren't tight with me for talking so much about the more thing but I do think this is a moral breaking point for the Republican Party because I don't think that we can get away with the vision of governance that we are suggesting that we can know that we on the right can elect characterless people and get away with it because the whole point of being on the right the whole point of being on the right is that we are supposed to stand for virtue this is one of the things I'm writing about in my new book I'm working on a new book and the absence of virtue in political life and in common life the decision that we don't have to worry about virtue or inculcation of virtue or have a common definition of virtue this means that we are less happy as people it means we don't trust each other it means we don't trust our neighbors you wouldn't trust your neighbor but you wouldn't trust Roy Moore to babysit your child why would you trust for Roy Moore to make your policy why would you trust Roy Moore at the levers of the most powerful government in the history of humanity and these are you know I think that we should be asking these questions regardless if we have a right left or Center and I've been very very consistent on this okay time for some things I like and then some epic things I hate and a quick Big Idea so things I like I was on the plane yesterday lots of plane riding and and there is a and there's a movie that I was able to watch JetBlue by the way is spectacular I just have to say JetBlue is great they had free internet they had new movies just tremendous service all the way through and and I was able to watch this this movie from Taylor Sharon and one of my favorite directors hell or high water and Sicario and the movies Wind River and Jeremy Renner and elizabeth Olsen Jeremy Renner is terrific elizabeth Olsen is not but the movie itself is that the movie itself is quite good the last half-hour of it is is really tense and spectacular it's very gritty okay it's very upsetting there's there's one team near the end where a crime is replayed and it is very deep I mean it is deeply upsetting so if you're not up for that then you probably won't be up for any of Taylor Sheridan's films but that the movie itself is is effective and an interesting and takes on some issues with regard to Native reservations Native American reservations which which I think had been long neglected is a place that tremendous suffering goes on here's a little bit of the trailer any emergency assistance the Wind River Indian Reservation I'm June banner FBI welcome to Wyoming by yourself it's just me that's Cory Lambert is where I found the body most murders are never solved in in native reservations essentially she's a fighter most criminals are never found it's it's it's a very good movie and one of the things that I like about this film and one of the things I like about Taylor Sheridan's writing generally is that not only is he willing to do nuance but also he doesn't do these anti-american sucker-punches so one of the things that's really nice about this film is that it's all about investigation into a woman's murder on a on a Native American reservation but the person who's solving the murder is a white guy jeremy renner and this comes up right and he's not portrayed as somebody who's married to a Native American woman he's not portrayed as like an unsympathetic white guy walking onto a Native American reservation and raping the place that's not the idea the idea is that if we can find our common humanity then we're gonna be able to solve some problems whereas if we steep ourselves in these artificial divisions then we're never gonna be able to solve these problems like there's a couple of characters one who's a Native American character who sort of revels in his in the feeling of victimization and jeremy renner give him a nice lecture and then some white guys who revel in the idea that they get to victimize Native American girls and they're the bad guys so I think that it's I it's it's quite a good movie it's it's worth watching again as I say jeremy renner is very very good in it elizabeth olsen is less good in it just because she does wide-eyed the entire film elizabeth blunt in Sicario gives a much better performance than elizabeth olsen does but the movie is worth seeing okay it's not gonna get a lot of credit by the way because it's a Weinstein Company production and so it's it was slate it was slated for some awards it was one steam company produced and so now it's probably gonna get ignored because of the Weinstein which I find just yeah I mean Weinstein didn't make the movie put some money behind it I don't think that just cuz Weinstein put money behind something means the entire everything you put money behind his garbage I don't think that's right okay other things that I like so this was pretty funny yesterday Trump was giving his speech he said he had a big announcement when he came back from Asia he did not have a big announcement he announced basically all of the nice hotels he'd visited and then he he took a drink of water from a water bottle and for a brief moment in time the internet went insane Japanese companies have announced investments in the United States worth more than 8 billion dollars 17,000 jobs thank you they don't have water that's okay what but it goes drinking that water I like to look into the camera the steely-eyed glare as he tries to open this bottle of water Japanese manufacturers and everybody went nuts for a second because Donald Trump and of course mock Marco Rubio for drinking from the bottle of water Rubio actually he actually critiqued Trump on his water bottle technique which is pretty funny on Twitter so I thought that was kind of funny okay time for some things that I hate so as you know I love Twitter I'm very very active on Twitter I have almost a million followers there and I tweet incessantly annoying everyone in my feed and Twitter is now cracking down on blue checkmarks the way they're doing this is they're saying that they want to get rid of blue checkmarks for people who tweet controversial and nasty things so they got rid of it for some white supremacist like Richard Spencer and Baked Alaska and here's my problem with this I think all those people are garbage but the blue checkmark is there so that if somebody is imitating you it's supposed to verify you right if the idea is that if somebody is is imitating you you can report them for imitating you it's a protection against fraud essentially fraud protections still exist for bad people like if you want to kick off Baked Alaska because you think Baked Alaska is a scumbag and he violates your Terms of Service bring a white supremacist you know that's your that's your standard you're you're a private company can do you want but if you're removing verification check marks with that instant weather that inherently is doing is now you're saying that there are certain people whose messages are approved who we will continue to provide blue checkmarks and there are certain people whose messages are not approved we will not provide blue checkmarks and now it looks like Twitter is sponsoring certain messages it's really dumb business more than anything else I think Twitter's making a huge mistake it's very stupid okay other things that I hate this was an amazing picture okay so I have to show you this picture this was actually photographed by a P and this was real this is Steve minuchin and his wife Louise Linton okay they went to that they they went over to the US Mint and they they held up copies of the first currency notes bearing his and u.s. treasurer haveta Carranza signatures at the Bureau of Engraving and printing and I don't even know what's going on here I mean like it's a bit if you can't see the picture it's manoosh holding up the sheet and then his wife Louise Linton in Cruella de Vil gloves giving a Bond villain glare into the camera as she smiles holding this up the best tweet that I saw on this yesterday was Louise Louise Linton with Louise slit and with the things she loves and Steve minuchin I thought that was pretty good also the there's a picture of him holding up the sheet and her smiling at him while wearing apparently kylo ren's costume from the last from the last Star Wars movie it's pretty amazing you gotta love Louise Linton for owning it but yeah this is not a good look I mean you don't want to look plutocratic that's not exactly the best look the best look which of course led to one of my favorite things that I have ever seen which is somebody made this video of Steve minuchin and Steven action is let's say he's a rather smarmy character and Steve minuchin you have to laugh they cut a video of Steve minuchin talking but they filled his mouth with gargling sounds and it really works it's really funny was it appropriate that Tom Price was fired you regret making the requests you made for government aircraft whether it was to go to Kentucky I know there's an Inspector General on that one secretary munition I appreciate you coming on I don't know why I bet it was funny it made me laugh okay time for the big idea so I mentioned earlier that if they don't seat if they don't see Roy Moore after he's elected is this is slap in the face to the people of Alabama I think the answer is no I think that the people of Alabama many of them who would vote for Roy Moore don't want him in the Senate they just don't want Doug Jones there and so if you were replaced by somebody like Jeff Sessions I think that a lot of people in Alabama would probably breathe a sigh of relief I think a lot of Alabama voters say I'm not voting for Magellan's I don't want Jones in the Senate I don't want the election to get away I'll vote for more right them they'll make the binary decision and vote for more now that would be the logic anyway and right and won't work so we'll vote for him he'll win and then maybe they'll replace him so I think that does exist but second of all there's this idea that is going around I find it very irritating that institution that were specifically set up to check public excesses are now considered out of bounds it's terrible how dare you check what the public lawns here okay the founders never believed in democracy the founders believed in republicanism and found in fact the founders despise the idea of direct democracy the idea that the people know best in every situation never crossed the founders mind okay here's what John Adams wrote in 1814 remember democracy never last long it soon wastes exhaust and murders itself there never was a democracy yet that did not commit suicide it is in vain to say that democracy is less vain less proud at less selfish less ambitious or less avaricious than aristocracy or monarchy it is not true in fact and nowhere appears in history those passions are the same in all men under all forms of simple government and when unchecked produced the same effects of fraud violence and cruelty when clear prospects are open before vanity pride avarice or ambition for their easy gratification it is hard for the most considerate philosophers and the most conscientious more or less to resist the temptation individuals have conquered themselves nations and large bodies of men never right so John Adams saying listen it's a rectum ah Christine as you the people always are right is not true which is why you have a set of checks and balances if you believe that people are always right majority rule on everything you would need a Constitution you would need a set it you wouldn't need a house you would need a presidency you wouldn't need a judiciary you wouldn't need checks and balances can the Senate was given the authority as to whether to seat particular senators specifically for situations where senators should not be seated even though they were elected you know and somebody yesterday asked me well what if the electoral college had rogue electors who voted against Donald Trump what I said is that is what the electoral college was designed to do I would have disagreed that the electoral college should have seen Donald Trump is such a threat to democracy that wouldn't see him but originally this is what the electoral college was designed to do the electoral college was designed to stop bad men from entering high office or women that's what it was designed to do in fact if I had my druthers the electoral college would have said nixed to both of the candidates and then we would have been able to see somebody else in any case Chief Justice John Marshall said the same thing he said between a balanced Republican and democracy the difference is that is like that between order and chaos right we're a balanced republic is designed to check out the excesses James Madison writes this in Federalist 10 which we'll get to when we eventually get to Federalist 10 in our view the Federalist Papers I think next week is Federalist 4 he says democracies have ever been spectacles of turbulence and contention have ever been found incompatible with personal security or the rights of property and have in general been as short in their lives as they are violent in their deaths if we don't accept that some checks and balances are necessary to prevent the excesses of people who feel forced into binary positions then we're not going to be able to actually see what the system of government was meant to be okay so we will be back here tomorrow with all the latest we'll see if the Democrats continue to stand in hypocritical fashion by Al Franken and so we'll see if Bob Menendez walks free I'm Ben Shapiro this is the Ben Shapiro show
