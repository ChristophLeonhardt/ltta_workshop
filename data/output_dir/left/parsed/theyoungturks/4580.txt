>> HOBBY LOBBY IS BACK IN THE
NEWS, AND I WOULD LIKE TO GO OUT
ON A LIMB AND SAY THIS IS THE
WEIRDEST REASON TO BE IN THE
NEWS THAT I CAN THINK OF.
THEY
WERE CAUGHT TRYING TO IMPORT
$1.6 MILLION WORTH OF ANCIENT
ARTIFACTS, THEY GOT CAUGHT FOR
BECAUSE THINGS WERE LABELED
WEIRD.
THEY ARE BEING FORCED TO
PAY $3 MILLION IN FINES, GIVE
ALL OF THE ARTIFACTS BACK TO THE
GOVERNMENT, AND CHANGE THEIR
WAYS TO MAKE SURE WHEN THEY ARE
IMPORTING ANCIENT ARTIFACTS THEY
DO IT TO THE WAYS OF CUSTOMS AND
BORDER PATROL.
THIS ALL STARTED
BACK 
IN 2010.
JUST SO YOU KNOW
THEY PROCEEDED WITH THIS DESPITE
THE MANY 
RED FLAGS.
>> IT IS A REALLY SERIOUS CRIME
IF YOU BUY AN ARTIFACT THAT IS
ACTUALLY STATE PROPERTY OF
ANOTHER GOVERNMENT.
SO WHEN THEY
SAY SEND IT TO THE SEVEN
DIFFERENT BANK ACCOUNTS, OF
COURSE IT IS ILLEGAL.
>>ALSO THE PEOPLE WHO SHIPPED IT
LABELED IT STUFF NOT LIKE
ANCIENT ARTIFACTS ñ YOU NEED TO
LABEL IT WHAT IT IS SO THEY MAKE
SURE IT IS NOT LOOTED.
THEY JUST
LABELED IT CERAMICS, WHICH
TECHNICALLY IT IS, AND TILE
PIECES WHICH I GUESS SOME OF
THESE COULD BE CONSTRUED
AS THAT.
WHY ARE THEY BUYING ALL THIS
STUFF?
>> THAT IS THE BEST PART.
SINCE
2009 HOBBY LOBBY ñ YOU GUYS
MIGHT REMEMBER THEM.
THEY WANTED
TO IMPOSE THEIR RELIGION ON
THEIR EMPLOYEES.
THEY DIDN'T
WANT TO COVER INSURANCE THAT
COVERS ABORTIONS BECAUSE JESUS
DIDN'T LIKE ABORTIONS, ALTHOUGH
HE NEVER MENTIONED IT. 2009
BECAUSE THEY LOVED JESUS AND THE
BIBLE, THEY STARTED BUYING
HISTORICAL BIBLES AND OTHER
ARTIFACTS.
SO FAR, GREAT, NO
PROBLEM.
IT TURNS OUT THEY GOT
REALLY INTO IT AND STARTED
BUYING MORE AND MORE.
THEN THEY
STARTED DOING IT LEGALLY
HERE, WHICH THEY HAVE
ADMITTED.FOR SOMEONE WHO IS
PASSIONATE ABOUT THE BIBLE, I'M
PRETTY SURE THOU SHALT NOT STEAL
IS IN THE BIBLE.
IT IS SUCH A
PERFECT MICROCOSM OF 
A
FUNDAMENTALIST IDEOLOGY.
>> IF IT WAS PLACED THERE BY
GIDEONS IN THE HOTEL ROOM,
I'M SURE THEY WOULD TAKE IT.
>> IF YOU STILL IMPORTANT
ARTIFACTS AND LIE ABOUT IT ON
PURPOSE, THAT IS PRETTY
UNCHRISTIAN.
>> LET'S GO TO GRAPHICS SEVEN.
THIS IS WHAT HOBBY LOBBY HAS
AGREED TO IN THE WAKE 
OF THIS.
IS 
SO 
FRUSTRATING ñ HEY, YOU
WON'T HAVE ACCESS TO BIRTH
CONTROL BUT WE HAVE $1.6 MILLION
TO SPEND ON MESOPOTAMIAN
CUNEIFORM.
>> HE'S RIGHT, HE MAKES IT SEEM
LIKE IT WAS AN HONEST MISTAKE.
YOU HAD AN ANCIENT ARTIFACT THAT
YOU DISPLAYED IN A SUPER WEIRD
WAY, AND WE MISLABELED AND
SENT IT OVER HERE.
OOPS.
GUESS WE WON'T MAKE THAT HONEST
MISTAKE AGAIN.
>> WHERE THESE GO WHEN THEY GET
CONFISCATED BY THE GOVERNMENT?
>> I HOPE THEY WOULD HAVE A
PROCESS BY WHICH THEY
DETERMINE WHERE IT ACTUALLY CAME
FROM AND RETURN IT.
>>PART OF ME HOPES TO GET PUT ON
A FORKLIFT AND GETS PUT NEXT TO
THE ARK OF THE COVENANT LIKE THE
LAST SCENE IN THE RAIDERS
OF THE LOST ARK.
