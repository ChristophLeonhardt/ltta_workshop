Democrat New York Governor Andrew Cuomo has extended voting rights to 35,000 convicted felons or as he calls them the Democrat base we will analyze why Democrats rely on felons foreigners and children to help them win elections then the latest in donald trump assuring in an era of peace for the entire world and a word on barbara bush something that everybody is missing finally the mail bag i'm michael Knowles this is the Michael Nolt show hey everybody so I'm still in on the road I'm in Philadelphia I've just finished a delicious cheesesteak and I'd never want to leave this place you know it's very good for a bone to be here and so anyway I'm speaking tonight at Trump University the University of Pennsylvania Wharton School of Business yeah we call it Trump University for short people have been pulling down my flyers during a you know during campus walks and things like that they've been finding the fliers literate all over the campus so we definitely don't want the word to get out that this event called reasons to vote for Trump is gonna be happening tonight at 7 p.m. in John Huntsman hall at the University of Pennsylvania that that's really gonna upset the students there at Trump University so don't I just don't spread the word don't let anybody know that it will be at 7 o'clock tonight in Huntsman Hall at Trump University also known as the University of Pennsylvania that should be a lot of fun so before we get started there's a lot to talk about today a lot the Democrats are there moving beyond satire at this point they're actually becoming parodies of themselves just springg the jails freeze so that they can get more voters before we talk about that we have to talk about Skillshare because look I don't want you to be some like dirty rut and derelict you know the kind that they're trying to go ahead and get what you need to do is better yourself only by bettering yourself will you be able to make a better life and you don't need to rely on somebody else to do it for you one of the greatest things that I've come into contact with by doing this show is Skillshare so I love using Skillshare it is really really good it's an online learning platform with I think 18,000 classes in all sorts of useful things so they have a design business technology all of that I have to look to read those because I don't take any of the useful ones i I do ones like time management that one's pretty good hard to find the time you know but then when you do it hopefully you can learn all the other things but look it's 2018 so you're gonna need you can't just go work at the plant for 60 years and then cash in your pension that's not how the economy works anymore you need to be able to build up a little side hustle build up your own profession skills and then also if you find yourself with some free time you've you've listened to every single episode of the podcast you've seen all of the breakouts you've sent it to your friends you should just do something to

okay do that right now Skillshare dot-com / michael mi CH AE l Skillshare comm / michael mi CH AE l don't spell it like they spell it at the coffee shops Skillshare comm / michael okay let's get into this thing you know I think Cuomo is just trolling me practically he's I was going through New York State I was in New York for like six hours and he decides hey I'm gonna spring all the jails so we can get somewhere Democrat voters absolutely outrageous and it really did get me thinking this is what the Democrats rely on they rely on felons and foreigners and children I spent at least 10 minutes this morning trying to make that alliteration work like felons and foreigners and fetuses or something like that but we all know the Democrat party's relationship to fetuses that is not exactly in the base so it couldn't work but they are all those three we'll talk a little bit about how they're doing that the the main thing we're seeing here is just a total subversion of the law the law in New York is if you're out on parole right you've been convicted of a felony and you're on parole you don't get to vote that's how it works your actions have consequences and if you're gonna commit felonies then you you lose some privileges of citizenship but Andy Cuomo doesn't like that now he's not gonna go in and change the law that would be too democratic that would be too too much law and order that would be too civilized instead what he's going to do this is what he said he goes quote it is unconscionable to deny voting rights to New Yorkers who have paid their debt and re-entered society why why is that first of all they haven't repaid their debt they're out on parole parole is when you get out a little early you get out temporarily you do you actually have not paid your debt to society so even on the premise he's wrong but why is that unconscionable why is that if someone commits a felony do we really want that person crafting policy for our country maybe in some cases but plenty of people get perfectly reformed and they come out and they're upstanding citizens again a lot of people don't do why is that unconscionable that would that we would deny them the right to vote really what this is all about it's just lining up new Democrat voters and I think Andy Cuomo knows this this has been a trend going on for a while in the Democrat Party and when they have governorships across the country the way that Andy Cuomo is going to do this is by pardoning them so he's going to take 35,000 people right now who were felons on parole and he's just gonna pardon them of their crimes so that then they had you know that that makes them into eligible voters you hear everyone raising Cain because Donald Trump the pardon scooter libby a guy who was guilty practically of nothing and everyone's freaking out about that because he's pardoned like one guy andy Cuomo says not only am i an important 35,000 right now I'm gonna keep pardoning them the more they come up for parole I'm just gonna keep pardoning and pardoning and pardoning and pardoning and then they're gonna keep voting for me in the United States there are 6.1 million people who were not able to vote in 2016 because of a felony conviction so either they're on parole they're you know they're inmates that whatever they couldn't vote in the election how do you think those guys are gonna vote are they gonna you know it they're gonna vote for their for their fellow crook they're gonna vote for their fellow criminal Hillary Clinton they're gonna break for Democrats there's no question about that right now one in 40 Americans 2.5 percent of the voting age population according to the Sentencing Project cannot vote now mind you 50% of the country that's voting age doesn't vote anyway they just don't want to vote but they're the left is taking issue with this that 2.5 percent of eligible voters can't vote would be eligible voters voting age P Americans can't vote why is who cares why is that a big deal they say this is awful the United States has one of the biggest prison populations in the whole world it's the highest incarceration rates in the world 670 inmates in the United States per 100,000 Americans that's so much higher than all of the other developed nations you know that we protect and that all look up to us because we have a way better country than they do it's five times the average of all of those the next closest is Israel with 250 inmates per hundred thousand you know the next closest is that other really really good country that is a beacon of hope and order and civilization in a terrible region of the world you know like man why wouldn't we why we want to be like that what can't we be more like Italy you know why don't we because Italy is runs rampant with crime the Mafia controls like half of that country no man you know it's just too many people and they point out the number of Americans incarcerated in prisons has increased over the last 25 years now look I'm not that old I haven't been roaming around this earth for too long but I've noticed something over the last 25 years that's confirmed by social science statistics we've increased the prison population over the last 25 years and crime has steadily decreased hmm I wonder if there's could you do you think there's possibly a correlation between those things the New York Times famously Fox Butterfield he ran ahead line something to the effect of prisons crime continues to drop despite prisons filling hmm you're saying despite maybe there's a correlation here between those two things so who cares if we have the highest incarceration rate in the world this isn't like the Soviet Union here this isn't like we're imprisoning political dissenters or something that only happened when Barack Obama didn't like Dinesh D'Souza cuz Dinesh D'Souza made a movie about him so then he threw him in jail for some ridiculous trumped-up charge but usually in the United States and certainly when good Republicans are in office that doesn't happen we don't just have a lot of political dissent read prisoners or anything like that we have criminals in prison that is a good thing we have the highest incarceration rate in the world good let's keep getting it a little bit higher baby because there's still crime going on on those streets up in a little bit more maybe we'll have some safer streets but of course this is a strategy that they want to pursue in Virginia we saw this in 2017 the Democrat Governor Terry McAuliffe he has started using executive orders to restore felons voting rights in 2016 and at the time we all knew what he was doing if he thought that the felons were going to break for Republicans he would never do it but Terry McAuliffe restored the Voting Rights of one hundred sixty eight thousand felons and forty-two thousand of them had registered to vote very quickly before that race in 2017 now that it wasn't close enough that race for that to really have made a difference you have to add in all of the other people who shouldn't be voting you know to get to when you get to those numbers but still that's a lot of people an extra forty two thousand votes for a tight election can really be a determining factor Democrats know this and they're not going to get fooled again right now in Maine and the People's Republic of Vermont current inmates are allowed to vote actual like people in prison I don't know if they get a furlough or something to go down to the polls and wreak some havoc both on our democracy and on the people around there and then they get to go back in but they choose to have actual prisoners voting more on this in one second but first we got to talk about a little honey you've heard me talk about honey before I

being a dumb parole actually paid his debt to society even then they still can't vote and listen to these states let me know if they sound like anything to you Alabama Arizona Delaware Florida Iowa Kentucky Mississippi Nebraska Nevada Tennessee Virginia and Wyoming the thing they have in common is they're like really nice states they're good States you know they keep their affairs in order and they're just like good and orderly and civilized they're not California which is just absolutely bankrupt or New York being flooded a sanctuary cities subverting federal law giving illegal aliens rights to vote things like that it isn't that at all and it's because they keep they keep a hard line here we'll get back to why this is the case the left calls this racist they say it's racist if you don't let either people who completed their sentences criminals that completed their sentences vote where people on parole vote or even people in prison vote if you don't let those all those criminals vote that's racist you said what are you talking about racist they say because it that means you're not gonna let black people vote say did you hear what you just said you just said you're the one you just said black people and criminals are synonymous that's what I didn't say that I don't think that I don't think that's true you said that but they do that oh they they say oh it's rate it's just racist and we're this really all comes from there have always been these little moves oh hey man hey wouldn't it be cool if we let criminals vote you know they'd always have do a little bit the 2000 election that's what broke this now that's where this all started to steamroll up to a 2002 study found that Democrat candidates received seven out of every ten votes that would be cast by felons or ex felons in fourteen of the then previous fifteen US Senate election years they get 70% of them that's just one study that shows this another study so put it in starker terms which is that had felons been allowed to vote in Florida in 2000 Al Gore would have won that election sore-loser Minh would have actually ended up winning the election and being the president and now would in very terrible because that election came down to 537 votes that was not a big election so that could really matter I mean that would swing whole elections now that's that's the reason they were doing it it's the same thing with a amnesty same with all these things they just want votes they just want to have they've even admitted this in a Democrat memo that it's important to their electoral strategy to get all of these sort of undesirable constituencies to vote for them and so you've got the criminals that's that's the new bit that's in the news today you also have the foreigners we know that illegal and legal aliens illegal aliens and legal immigrants recent immigrants to the United States identify with Democrats between three times as frequently and eight point seven five times as frequently huge disparities between identifying Republican or dent affiant Emma Kratt so they say give us amnesty give us amnesty we're gonna let all the X criminals vote then we're gonna let all of the foreigners vote there even do their giving ID cards out there letting illegal aliens vote in certain elections and then the children then think of the children so these are the most manipulable constituencies right you got these felons who are you know what their lifeline is the state right they're they're in a very direct relationship to the state then you've got illegal aliens who are living in the shadows and say we'll give you this little goodie we'll give you this amnesty but you've got to remember to vote for it and then kids so right now DC Washington DC is considering allowing 16 year-olds to vote in the next presidential election very bad I just imagine that kid from Parkland High School from Douglass High of Stoneman Douglas high school that guy's gonna vote excuse me that guy is gonna vote in the next presidential election if DC gets its way it's always lefty places that are doing this district the District of Columbia and these states you got to remember 18 year olds have only been allowed to votes since 1971 since the 26th amendment probably not a great idea to do that then probably not a great idea to do that now this brings us to the question what is the vote why is it just like I need my right to fight deserve my right to vote it's all elections are always better if the most number of people vote if the highest number of people can can vote why is that the case we want good like good people to vote we want people who are somewhat informed who have a clear political vision who have a good political vision who love the country love their country with that's who we want to vote we don't want just anybody to vote why don't we let the whole world vote in our elections why why just limit it to look they're already trying to extend voting rights to foreign nationals who happen to be in the United States why not let the whole world vote in our elections because that's probably not a great idea there's this really shallow thinking in our in modern liberal democracy that oh with the more votes the better Rock the Vote South Park parodied this with Puff Daddy and they said like vote or die I'm gonna shoot you if you don't vote no if you don't want to vote don't vote please don't vote please if you do not want to vote if you feel that you're not equipped to vote don't do it let people who know what they were doing and have a vision for America those guys should vote and it definitely shouldn't be those little kids that CNN's trotting on TV that's what this is all pointing toward so we should not let that happen okay before we have a lot of mailbag to get to I got to wrap it up here before that I do want to have a note on Barbara Bush everyone is so sad about Barbara Bush it hit everybody hard I we I had to show with Owen yesterday so we didn't get to talk about this other than that Fresno State professor who I won't even acknowledge her name we said those mean things about Barbara Bush other than that everyone is so sad and I was wondering why is that she was 92 years old she lived a good life we're not weeping for Barbara Bush were weeping for ourselves I think we're weeping for not the death of Barbara Bush but the death of marriage a marriage that their marriage lasted 73 years George Bush and Barbara Bush were weeping for the death of high school sweethearts that stay together and have kids and you know get married at age 20 or however old they were were weeping for the death of a culture of politeness and civility and and culture itself of being cultured and restraint and a little bit of formality and strength and on that point of strength were weeping for the death of strong womanhood truly strong womanhood Barbara Bush I've read all the books that george w bush has written and he refers to dad you know he calls George Bush dad but he only referred to Barbara as mother his mom all of the stories of Barbara Bush she took a firm hand she was a tough cookie you know this was not not someone that you'd mess with lightly and that's a look she wasn't the CEO of some company she was a wife she was a wife who was one of the strongest women in the country idolized she was strong she was strong in her family she ran that roost you know she kept everybody together she kept it all going but it was it was so traditional it was not that she was out there with the pink hats screaming with signs or anything like that and and that's died and it's made women weaker and it's made society more coarse and I think we're coming to grips with that and we're we're looking back and saying I wasn't that nice that's why we're not look she Barbara Bush lived a great life she lived to be 92 years old she died holding her husband of seven plus decades his hand and they were holding hands at the moment she died there's nothing to be sad about in that life there's nothing tragic about that that's a good way to go what's sad is what the culture has become and the moral absurdity that has replaced that that nicer culture the legalism and your relationship to the state and the selfishness of just saying no I'm gonna I think I'm just gonna be single forever and just do whatever I want and me me me me me and that's all it is and it's not about relationships and it's not about building something that's not about shared experience that's not about a life that has a coherent beginning middle and end and a purpose we've lost a lot of that and maybe this moment of reflection is everyone's weeping for Barbara Bush maybe we'll think about that ourselves and say maybe it's time we try to fix our culture just a thought I don't want to end on that really sad nod so I will just point out very briefly Donald Trump is bringing peace to the Korean Peninsula after seven you know the bushes were married over 70 years the Korean War has been going on for about 70 years and Donald Trump may finally be ending it they're talking about formally ending the Korean War there was a truce in 1953 but it could be formally ending now under President qoph FA and you can tell by the way the Donald Trump has been working on this pretty hard he just admitted that he sent Pompeo the CIA director to personally meet with Kim jong-un last week China is furious about this China because by the way the Korean War was always a war between the US and China it wasn't really about the north the North Koreans and the South Koreans it was always a proxy war between the US and China it looks like it still is and right now Donald Trump is squeezing the Chinese this week the Trump administration prevented American suppliers from selling parts to a major to Chinese tech giant the there were you know there were a lot of Chinese soldiers millions of soldiers who fought in the Korean War and in the old days the pre conditions necessary for denuclearization in North Korea was that the u.s. led all of the troops out of the south now that's not even a precondition apparently from stories that are coming out of North Korea sounds like the art of the deal to me guys I know that it we all keep making fun of Trump and saying oh you just got lucky oh he just got lucky he keeps getting lucky he just keeps keeps getting lucky now it's important here during the art of the deal that Kim doesn't try to get us to have a massive troop reduction we can keep some troops but not all of them that that would give China a great victory here we can't do that especially as they aggress into the South China Sea we need to keep a pretty robust American military presence there looks like it's going pretty well so I'll keep my fingers crossed for all that cough fa we've got to get to the mailbag we have a lot of mailbag today before we do that then I got to go get ready for this speech and let I don't know maybe an tifa's they're like wielding their clubs already before we do that go to daily wire comm if you're already on the website thank you you help us keep the lights on even in this great DaVinci meeting space in the middle of Philadelphia if you're not there go you get me at the end reply be sure you get the Ben Shapiro show none of that matters guys if Donald Trump brings peace to Korea you need this tumblr man oh my guts you are gonna drown in thews you're gonna go down to Davy Jones's Locker the monumental tidal waves of salty leftist tears are going to be so enormous get that leftist here's tumblr it's happening right now there's going to be a talk between Trump and Kim get that leftist here's tumblr before it's too late save yourself we'll be right back all right we have a little bit of time left we got to burn through these mailbag questions we got some really good ones today first one from Grayson Michael I really enjoy your show keep up the good work recently you interviewed Owen Benjamin and he said CrossFit is a bit of a cult and I tend to agree I've been a competitive swimmer since I was four years old and I was wondering if you think that world is also a cult thanks Grayson I don't know about competitive swimming you by defer to your superior knowledge but I suspect it is because a lot of these things are now what are some other cults there's a CrossFit there you know there's this joke crossfitter an atheist and a vegan walk into a bar how do I know because they wouldn't shut up about it they'd you know they just tell you me they wear it on their sleeves the veganism environmentalism the global warming people the PETA people even some really serious Patriots sometimes like the civil religion types and obviously the leftists and the intersectionality people those are all substitutes for religion you know it there's their cults they are cults because everybody's got to serve somebody so if you're not going and having reconciliation with your priest and we're repenting or you know scourging yourself and saying Mia culpa mea culpa mea Maxima culpa then you're going to be buying carbon off off offsets and carbon tax credits so that you can undo your sin of pollution everybody's got to serve somebody you were going to do this you're going to make the animals into a sort of God into a nature worship oh the innocent animals there's so much better than us stop killing the chickens donate the joy you're just even a civil religion and we conservatives fall into this a little bit you know you can't substitute God with the United States I love the United States - it's a wonderful country that isn't worthy of a worship that's worthy of protecting and defending and admiration but you you people can take things a little too far and it's when you don't worship the guy who's who is named I am I am you know Moses asks God he says who should I tell them you are he says I am that I am when you don't worship that then you have a pathetic question which is Who am I and you find all these little niche things so I don't know maybe maybe maybe you're taking swimming very seriously I don't know but you can do all of these things in moderation you just have to keep your priorities in order next question from Jeremiah I am sending this immediately after reading an article on your site about a wyoming a school district passing a policy allowing teachers to conceal carry given that we already have a bit of an issue with trained officers misusing firearms I don't know if unscrupulously arming school teachers is the best move my concern is that if anything went wrong such as a student disarming a teacher or god forbid a wrongful shooting of a student the Second Amendment wouldn't survive the backlash FairPoint according to the nation's center of educational statistics schools and university campuses are the safest areas in the u.s. when it comes to violent crimes and getting safer despite the uptick in shootings so I'm not convinced the risk is necessary I know there are restrictions for who can concealed carry in the bill but I find these things to be vague and unconvincing not to mention other districts might adopt less strict policies as well I'm a huge Second Amendment advocate but I don't want reactionary pro-gun policy and I don't see any right-wing voices proposing nuanced ideas of what qualifies a teacher to be armed around students so I'm sending this to all the Daily wire shows in the hopes of getting an answer from the leading authors and thought leaders of the right Knowles can answer to if he wants okay no don't worry about it so much don't worry about it your fear is that someone is gonna miss use a gun in schools they're gonna have a gun in schools when they shouldn't or they they're gonna use it wrong they already do that they already do that look the school shootings have declined precipitously since the early 1990s but if someone wants to bring a gun to a school and misuse it he's gonna do it he can easily do that already the point here is to have some people who can protect them in that case in that instance why should you surrender your Second Amendment rights or constitutionally protected civil rights because you're walking into what could be a very dangerous situation and a situation that will be much more dangerous if the bad guys know that nobody has a gun in there if somebody it's not about arming teachers it's not about saying you need to carry a gun mrs. Smith and I I know that you've never shot one of these before but here you go here's an ar-15 have fun like a good guy you know that isn't what this is this is for people who already exercise their second Amendment rights who are familiar with firearms who are responsible with them to to be able to use those rights that plenty of people do that all the time in this country in the more sane parts of this country and as we all know more people are killed every year by hands and feet knives then are killed by ar-15s or any rifle of any kind whatsoever the the argument against it I don't see I see this very hypothetical if there were some way to know that we couldn't we could stop guns from being brought into schools and being misused then okay then that's fine then we don't need teachers to be able to use their second Amendment rights but if we could do that that would the problem would be totally solved right though that is the problem is that that is impossible and as long as that is impossible we need people who are responsible and sane and not evil and not criminals to be able to protect themselves and to protect others next question from Thomas troll Knowles hooray that the Korean Peninsula is now in peace during Donald Trump's presidency but what happens if we have a liberal in the executive either in 2020 or 2024 just wondering if you can foresee a conflict breaking out and the peninsula will go back on being dis unified if the GOP loses control of the White House love the coffe F anus of this show been a subscriber since 2017 tuned in to the daily wire ever since thanks Thomas yeah that's a real threat isn't it I mean that is a real threat used George Bush as an example of this the war in Iraq had been mismanaged it wasn't going very well George Bush undertook an act of serious political courage to surge the troops back when no one had the guts to do it no one wanted him to everyone was before the for the war before they were against the war and Bush did it and he won a victory in that country and then Barack Obama won and what did Barack Obama do he chose to lose that war a war that we had already one he chose to lose it he didn't want a Status of Forces Agreement he didn't want to maintain the peace he just wanted to squander the victories in Iraq the immense political courage it took to win those victories and cut and run because he ran on running against Iraq and restarting the war in Afghanistan for some reason because he needed a good war he needed a war that wasn't Iraq to position himself against Republicans there are huge threats here look look at Isis - Isis today would not exist wouldn't be nearly as devastating wouldn't have had so much control in that region if we hadn't just pulled all of our troops out and not secured a Status of Forces Agreement but these elections have big consequences and I wouldn't be surprised if forget Korea the the Democrats will squander a lot of hard-won victories from the past year and they're certainly going to try to impeach Donald Trump these are huge stakes so show up and vote in the midterms otherwise you can't complain go out there the stakes are really really high okay from Brad dear master of trolls Michael Knowles this past tax season I worked as a part-time tax associate at a tax prep company after I prepare my clients 2017 taxes I show them what their taxes would look like under the new 2018 tax rules the new rules have been beneficial to all of my clients I should be acting a political but when I explained how the 2018 tax rules benefit my clients I can't help but feel like I'm promoting Donald Trump and conservatism how can I present the benefits of the new tax plan without feeling like I'm promulgating a political agenda keep up the terrific work yeah reality is showing the advantages to having Donald Trump and Republicans in the government that is what reality does you come see unless you wanna lie to them you can't do that you know duh you can't you can't be a political especially not in your line of work your line of work is actually about central political issues how much of your own property you're allowed to keep and how you interact with this massive federal government that every year comes and gets its claws into all of your hard-earned money you can't do that but politics is the affairs of men and money and making money and paying money to the government is central to the affairs of men so you're not going to do that you know the the reality favors conservative governance and conservative thoughts things get better things get more just the societies become fairer more compassionate more charitable that's just the way it works don't worry about being apolitical it's like you know you've got this one really awful political agenda that hates its own country hates itself wants to sow division and destruction and then you have the other one that says make America great again say oh well they're about the same there's an equivalence there right now there's no equivalence that one's terrible and this one's good so you got to be honest with people from Taylor dear Kofi phony that was that's a good pun I don't believe in the literal presence of Christ in the Eucharist isn't a more plausible reason that the disciples react so strongly to Jesus's language used during the Last Supper simply because he is making himself the center of a Passover meal and not because they think he is literally advocating cannibalism at the very least the Eucharistic rituals practiced today in the Catholic Church or a far cry from the simple breaking of bread by first century Jewish nomads at likely a dirty table with likely soiled hands doesn't the pomp and circumstance and mysticism miss the point it's a metaphor man come on genuinely interested sincerely big fan of the show Taylor know the things that you just said aren't true they aren't true the Eucharist as it is practiced even in 2018 is spiritually identical with what was happening even in first century in the in the first century even among people who lived during the time of Christ on earth and knew Christ and became the early converts to Christianity with regard to the metaphor you're missing what a metaphor is you're misunderstanding what a metaphor is this happened first of all nobody doubted the real presence of Christ in the Eucharist until the sixteenth century or so nobody has any kind of big theological movement in the West that was able to spread more Luther didn't do that until the day he died he believed in the real presence of Christ in the Eucharist this is a very modern concept that comes out of rationalism in the modern era metaphor is you're using metaphor to say not literal write a symbolic but not literal and but the word literal which means not symbolic is referring to letters which are symbols so the relationship between symbols and the symbolized is much more complicated between the literal and the metaphorical what you're what you're missing is what the Eucharist is what the sacraments are the Eucharist has been celebrated and consumed since the very beginning of the church since Christ instituted it and we can read that in the Gospels Ignatius of Antioch who was born either in 35 AD or 50 excuse me 50 AD he could have been alive during the time of Christ he died between 98 and 117 ad he mentions the Eucharist as the flesh of our Savior Jesus Christ that's in the first century Justin Martyr he refers to the Eucharist as the food over which the prayer of thanksgiving the word became received from Christ has been said is the flesh and blood of this Jesus who became flesh and the Deacons carry some to those who are absent the Deacons would actually carry the Eucharist had they felt it was so important a real thing symbol and symbolized coming together and Jesus is clear in his words he says this is my body this is my blood what is he doing Pliny the Younger writes of the Eucharist Hippolytus of Rome writes of it the decay you know the the teachings of the Twelve Apostles which was the it's the earliest catechism of the church from the first century it deals explicitly with these sacraments with baptism and with the Eucharist it also instructs on fasting and on daily prayer and things that I think are also a lot of more rationalist versions of Christianity now today would try to deny or ignore what when Christ says at that supper table do this in memory of me the word is anamnesis I'm not I don't have a lot of Greek but that that isn't just in memory or hey remember Jesus hey you remember him he was a nice guy it's it's more akin to a memorial sacrifice it's theologically rich and full there is something happening st. John Vianney said if we really what happened during the mass we would die not from fear but from love what is happening here pardon my directness you're missing the point come on man it's a metaphor you're what you were missing the point of what Christ is doing because in Christ you have the metaphor the metaphysical the logos the divine logic of the universe and the symbol the physical the flesh-and-blood coming together in one in the Incarnation in the Incarnation the metaphysical and the physical become one they it's it's the meaning of heaven and earth and that's what we have in the sacraments as well the sacraments are regular touchings of heaven and earth together so that the physical and the metaphysical become the same thing that's why they're so important that's why everyone has always defended them that's why the early Protestant innovators all defended them practically all defended these things they're so spiritually important they're so essential to what Christ is that to deny them is missing the point do we have time we have time for like one more I think let's see how what would be a good one to do all right I'm going to be a lot of people were upset with my Germany episode of ahead Germany is the worst country in the world but I'm just gonna have to get to the main we'll get to that in the conversation or something or at next week's mailbag let's go to this last question dear mr.
