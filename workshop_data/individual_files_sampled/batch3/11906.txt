hello and welcome to crosstalk where all things are considered I'm Peter LaBelle the transatlantic relationship has had many ups and downs since its inception after the Second World War it has said this relationship is weathered these moments of tensions and differences due to American leadership inter Donald Trump can the transatlantic relationship survive the current occupant in the White House crosstalking the transatlantic relationship I'm joined by my guest Michael Maloof in Washington he is a former senior security policy analyst in the office of the Secretary of Defense in London we have entertained Paul Maher he is a professor of international politics at City University London and in Oxford we cross to Marc almond he is the director of the crisis Research Institute all right gentlemen crosstalk rules in effect that means you can jump in anytime you want and I always appreciate let me go to mark first in Oxford on skype you know mark um I the these last few programs I keep betraying my age well I can remember a good part of the history of the transatlantic relationship and there have been ups and downs they've been policy differences we can think of a Vietnam we can think of the illegal invasion and occupation of Iraq during the Reagan administration it was intermediate missiles and they've pretty much been resolved those were problems I get the impression now that it's turning into divisions of about values and and with the position of each in the world because the Europeans after all these decades have pretty much you know tied themselves to the United States and have very limited options and they're not very happy about it is this a crisis of ideology and values now not just policy issues mark in Oxford well I think it's a mixture it's a crisis of values where there's a big different disagreement about what is important to what should be principles between Berlin and Paris on one side and Washington on the other so we say but it's also about variables in many ways the Atlantic Alliance from the late 40s onwards was one in which the United States was preferred to pay an economic price for security and geopolitical advantage and so the Marshall Plan and onwards meant that there were several trade imbalances that revived the European Western European economies and initially the expense in those states but overall everybody benefited now Trump is saying it has to be a cost-benefit analysis on a day to day basis and putting America first means the America has to come out on top and that of course is causing serious problems to European industry to European finance in general because suddenly the United States is throwing spanners in the works in all sorts of directions probably has the Iran deal sanctions on Russia and so on which have a big effect and then also Trump articulates a view of the world which the European elites and quits in the European media regards with horns quite frank and so there's a problem and then we'll support them even with the British just supposed to sell out united states they find themselves challenged economically and also challenged to some extent on what is publicly acceptable here and Trump of course hasn't helped by tweeting about things in Britain that have gone against the grain of British public opinion if I can stay with stay with the the British Isles here the issue the the very top of this we have the Iran deal with the u.s. withdrew from but it seems to me that that is an archetype of the problems of the transatlantic relationship right now because the Europeans are being told that they have to pay an economic price when they're staying in the deal and Iran it wants to stay in the deal to I mean it seems a you know a bit large on the part of the United States saying well since we don't want to be part of it you shouldn't be part of it and this gets down to really kind of sovereignty at least EU sovereignty I'd like to talk a little bit about energy as well but I mean the Europeans are being asked to go against their best interests in almost every single way and this is causing a great deal of tension go ahead in London I think yeah you've summarized the position in some respects but I do not think that there is a kind of fundamental breach I think the Europeans are clearly unhappy the one major diplomatic success if you like they can claim was the Iran nuclear agreement and they're very upset at the United States withdrawal from it but on the other hand their ideas about Iran and Iran's regional power and it's ballistic missile testing they don't differ very much so I think they they would appear to be a big tactical difference here and so I would add what I would argue is that at the at the core of transatlantic relations from the very beginning I don't think there was ever any altruism involved there was always a position of power at a negotiation about power and power distribution so I think what the situation is now is that it's changed and to some extent there's a renegotiation of those relationships and I don't think it's only the United States which is acting much more towards his particular nation interest European powers among themselves have always had a tension between the European element and their national interest so I think this is just being exacerbated at this particular time and clearly Donald Trump plays a particular game but I think in the end the levels of interdependence between the European Union Europe and the United States remain very very high and I think there is a bit of upset here but I don't think there's a fundamental breach well we'll say it there are many tensions which I've listed right brain let me go to Michael in Washington I mean inter dependency I think there's a lot more dependency than inter dependency and that's what we're seeing right now and I guess fundamentally can we have a transatlantic Alliance coalition as it were Kenny coexist with America first and Donald Trump Michael well it's B it's beginning to erode what we're seeing is an erosion and perhaps they a replacement of the us-led unilateral a world order and I think that the the breaking out or leaving the the Iranian deal the jcpoa was a watershed moment for countries in Eurasia and especially Iran as well as in Western Europe and what we're seeing emerged now is a new geopolitical shift to a much more multipolar approach and and we're already seeing this just like what you probably saw in st. Petersburg with with the Belton Road initiative combined with the yes the Shanghai Cooperation Organization and the Eurasia European Union all beginning to come together with its membership forming this separate economic world order bloc that's that's actually going to counter and respond to what Donald Trump has now done I think Europe Europe as well because of the sanctions are going to are going to rebuilt it as much as they can and we're going to see that they're going to want to maintain that trade with with with Iran as well as with the other countries in that in that region of the world the whole idea because the United States insists upon having the Israeli policy interfere with every foreign policy decision that makes it's actually going to it's actually beginning to shift away from that and we're seeing that already you know you know market the the it seems that you know there's a perception I've heard this many times if the United States is treating its its friends worse than its enemies I mean it's essentially going down a track of threatening to sanction European countries and their companies and this is getting I you know I think it's the first time in the in the transatlantic alliance experience where you know sovereignties really seems to been in is being infringed upon I mean threatening companies that you know you're there's financial transactions you know it's forcing companies to start trading in other currencies so the the the US Treasury Department can't go after you I mean is that what you Nate o Allies are supposed to be worried about from the United States now I mean this is a new dilemma but this coalition this alliance is a facing go ahead mark I can show my age by saying I do remember when mrs. Thatcher had a falling-out with Morgan over the US attempt to prevent the export of aid and Soviet cast Western Europe around British companies taking part in that so there'll be presidents the point is that in those cases quite quickly the common interest overrode the divisions and they found a way out of it whereas today we face the prospect I think that Donald Trump could be very good was that the office for the remainder of this term he could be reelected and if he continues with these policies he's really challenging the European sense of self-esteem in the one area where they feel like a great part yes the EU is a geopolitical pick me as a military pick me but it is a trading superpower Germany loaded after all in sports more than the United States imports and that's a lot of exports so Germany in China for instance and also in countries like Japan have an economic common interest in the wider world which Trump is trying to unsettle because he cuz he wants to cut back dramatically the US trade deficit but that actually means hitting to great extent his key partners as well as a potential geopolitical drive like China so we really have structural changes taking place maybe all these decades of cooperation all the cultural context between West and the United States and the broader West will some her of them tend to mitigate this but I have a feeling within the end it will be dollars and cents that counts yeah you know Interjet let me go back to you in London I mean the right before that Trump would you from the Iran deal we had Boris Johnson visiting we had Emmanuel macron visiting Trump as well and I I think that they were expecting some kind of negotiation like allies and friends are supposed to do and they they returned home with empty-handed in the meantime Angela Merkel has visited Putin twice and gone to China she didn't even go to Washington there's a perception at least on this side of the pond is that the United States isn't interested in negotiations it's more interested in dick Todd do it or else go ahead in London well actually Angela Merkel did go to Washington DC and well before withdraw yes along with Matt chrome for example just after micron and was given a slightly different kind of treatment I think there's a really it is very complicated question and I think to some extent there's a there's a kind of broad long-term shift going on in the kind of global geopolitics and geo-economics and I think then there are these kind of tactical transactional isms which Trump is championing and I think to some extent trumping is being criticized but I in the end he's standing up for what he believes he's the American she's he's King and he's keeping his promises let's keep that in mind he it shouldn't be surprising okay he said this on the campaign trail keep going keep going yes and I think what I would say about that to you is is that I think a large part of this is really a sort of tactical power play and it's as much dicta directed at home at is a political base to try to show them that he is standing up for the United States the key thing that he had promised really that America first was going to do for them was to basically give them back economic and other hope and I don't think actually any of this is going to help that call base at all so in the end effectively it's a big theater and I think the levels of the amounts of money we're talking about here in guard to the kind of sanctions on on trade or trade tariffs or whatever is relatively small it could lead to more small and trade Wars usually start small here gentlemen we're gonna go to a short break and after that short break we'll continue our discussion on the transatlantic relationship stay with our team welcome back to crosstalk where all things are considered I'm Peter Lavelle's remind we're discussing the transatlantic relationship I gotta go back to Michael in Washington one of the interesting questions that have risen that is hasn't given is has isn't give much coverage is the energy politics and energy security that includes the the UK the rest of Europe the United States and interestingly and importantly Russia here and Germany is very much in the center of with Nord Stream pipeline the second one that's going to be is being built and the Americans are profusely against this pipeline because they want to import or export to Europe very expensive LNG and the Germans are resisting it and they could face sanctions as we talk announcements could be made this is a very important issue because Germany and the European Union are actually de facto being denied the ability to determine their energy security it's the u.s. wants to dictate that go ahead Michel well it has to do with Russian dominance of it and that's the problem and the u.s. as you point out is a johnny-come-lately to this the in wanting to ship LNG or liquefied natural gas but the problem for the United States is it only has one port in Louisiana that can export it and secondly most of the European countries except those along the coasts have any LNG capabilities the countries that really really need this kind of gas that are much more internally and certainly Germany as well but the pipeline structures that exist right now and are being built up with Russian dominance if you will is what's irritating the neocons here in Washington and and certainly the Trump administration so it's a johnny-come-lately effort and I I don't think it's going to succeed and and they need natural gas now because winter is not all that far away and they they have to have a reliable source and you're gonna you're gonna see more and more of these countries integrating themselves apart from the United States because of this activity and energy is just one aspect that of that whole geopolitical shift that were that we're seeing emerge at this point you know let me go back to Oxford Market again it gets down to being able to make sovereign decisions I mean I mean I don't think you have to be very ideological or very partisan the question well why should a country that's on the other side of the planet determine your energy policy when you have a neighbor that wants to provide energy at a reasonable price and your companies are involved in a joint venture to build that pipeline I mean I don't see how threatening that possibly could be except for you want the market you want the market share I get that I get that that's fine okay but it should be the Europeans that ultimately make that decision mark in Oxford well obviously decide that also the United States would like to weaken Russia's position by weakening the state revenue by cutting your tax bolts of energy but as the Austrian president friend of Ellen said the great problem is that LNG is only economically viable when energy prices are high and actually because you negotiate long term contracts with Russia to receive gas you get the gas well below the price of which LNG is viable so you have this it is almost as with all our data to a contradiction in order to make LNG viable you have to create a high revenue stream for Russia which makes Russia stronger we makes it more fearful to the West but if you try to bridge any if you also have bad relations with Iran you'd pull out of your own deal you push up energy prices to actually make the position of these countries that you are hostile to or suspicious or stronger and also you make their ability to offer rebates to customers more attractive so it actually is not a very clever policy it's not going to achieve what its intended to okay it's changing gears I talked a little bit about NATO you know the ever since the end although the advent of the Cold War in the Warsaw Pact we've had NATO when the Soviet Union came to an end NATO decided to stick around and look for a new mission for itself unfortunately in 2018 I guess that mission is to vent to defend against Russia but the European countries don't really want to pay for their defense they kind of like having the u.s. pick up the tab Tom Trump says you got to pay more and they still don't do it so it's kind of hard to convince publics that Russia is such a threat if you don't want to pay for your own defense except for Poland wants to spend two billion dollars to have American troops there well why don't they just pay give the two billion dollars to the Germans and the Germans can do it for them okay I mean there's a lot of possibilities there okay again countries they want want to have secure borders and particularly visa vie Russia they don't want to pay for it so what how do you square the circle there go ahead in London well I think in Germany actually there are quite strong pressures from various sides of the political spectrum to to strengthen German military power and also it's kind of much more independent stance on a number of global questions so I don't think there's an unwillingness on the part of many of the European powers which of NATO to increase military spending to 2 percent which is what they're actually committed to under the there's a lot of resistance to pay to reach that 2% of GDP I mean they've been talking about it for years and they're still not doing it okay what only four countries out of the out of the entire block actually do that okay I mean they still resist doing it so that doesn't cut water with me no they want something for free and then if they don't get it for free they don't want to pay for it that that's a Michael you but you worked at the Defense Department yeah well I I see that the the emphasis is more on economic betterment between Europe and and and Russia because that is a they have a major dependency there but the whole military concept has basically evaporated in favor of more economic opportunities such as in dealing with Iran dealing with China dealing with with with Russia I mean it's it's expanding and and and NATO as you pointed out is still an entity trying to find a new mission and they went to Afghanistan for a little while they're still there but you know it's still it's it's it's on life support frankly and the Europeans that front for for itself is looking internally to have its own defense mechanism and the French are pushing that pretty much and and I think the Germans because of what Trump has been doing it and the way he's been bludgeon in them I think they're they're beginning to re-examine that that concept but they don't see the threat that that the neocons and Trump do from from Russia from China or from from Iran as Trump does okay let me go back to you in London because he didn't get to really finish your point there I mean do you think that there is the political will I mean the European Union for all of its problems is a one of the richest places on the planet I mean it's not like it doesn't have resources has plenty of resources unfortunately a lot of them are wasted but there they still are relatively rich why shouldn't they just you know step up and and and and really say if they're complaining about the United States and Trump why don't they just go it alone like it's not as if they don't have the resources to do it go ahead well I think going it alone is probably unviable for any major power or block today that interdependence which has built up is very very dense the networks which are financial economic political security intelligence as well as people-to-people ideas in every respect you look at the interdependencies of of major global pillars they are very very great they're not going anywhere you can try to shake them up you can rearrange them a little bit you can renegotiate relations and I think that's what a Trump is trying to do and some other powers are trying to do as well but I don't think you're going to get rid of that I know the Europe wants to or can go alone Britain is finding itself look at the position we're in now negotiating a brexit deal look how difficult it is to try to do anything meaningful with that because in the end you cannot just divorce yourself from a global economy and so on what you can do is try to create a sort of national conditions under which you can control the effects of globalism and I think that is what is effectively happening on a worldwide scale because the people of the countries within like the United States and elsewhere as well they're suffering from the effects of inequality they're suffering from the fact there's unemployment because of technological change and innovation and I think people like Donald Trump are effectively misleading their own electrons by calling for America first and I do think they're gonna solve any of those problems but in the end that is where the pressure is really coming from and I think that is not going to go away and that is going to lead to a degree of national level of control so I think there's going to be a renegotiation of the global it's pretty pessimistic what you just said because sounds like all these organizations are straitjackets you're in it and you can't get out and there's one hegemon that will determine the rules I mean that's the same essentially what you're saying mark I mean I I think that there is a political will and division I think that there could be much more multiplayer polarity I think there could be a lot more equality in it but I don't see the political whittling the Europeans can moan and groan all they want but they're fat and happy with the situation the way it is and Trump is in the u.s. is gonna bet even I Pat them and they won't be able to do much about it go ahead mark well I also there is a problem when we talk about the Europeans who do we mean there is the network deletes of people's involved in government and so on who were very comfortable with the old order and in a sense they're unhappy about Trump shaking it out but also they can't imagine leaving it but then we've seen whether it's the Braves eat bird the Italian election even the Austin elections and so on a huge popular armrest including in Germany with all sorts of aspects we've been hearing about of the downsides of globalization that's why Trump after all one residency in the United States so I think there is a crisis of the West and in a way it's something which the elites in the later don't really notice struck me that NATO has just held its first meeting in its new purpose-built headquarters and the only door of Sociology that I I respect is Cecil Parkinson's law that any organization that moves into a brand new purpose-built headquarters will go bust within 18 months and one fears that we have this kind of institutional inertia that can't really mention that the architecture that's been built up over the previous decades is seeing its foundation sapped away by the very popular consent which after all was the basis of a democratic alliance ok Michael in Washington last 40 seconds of the program goes to you go ahead yeah I think what we said but fundamentally what we're seeing is that the erosion of that unilateral world order and it's beak and it's beginning to catch up to RIA reality is beginning to catch up to the Europeans just like with Teresa may she's doing brexit of course that she looked to the US as an alternative market but because of sanctions now she's going to be looking more and more toward China and I think you're gonna see that wave increasing in the coming years simply because we have this new multipolar emerging that that is kind of just isolate in effect isolate the US unless it stops it's it's batting people over the head all the time well we'll see well we'll see if America first can coexist with the transatlantic alliance that has existed since the Second World War seems pretty incompatible to me but we'll see that's all the time we have gentlemen many thanks so much to my guests in Washington London and in Oxford and thanks to our viewers for watching us here at RT see you next time and remember crosstalk rules
