1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,439
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I guess the first thing to put things</font>

2
00:00:01,439 --> 00:00:03,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">in perspective is to ask you who your</font>

3
00:00:03,510 --> 00:00:06,480
hero is and why are they your hero how

4
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:08,820
did you come across them how do<font color="#E5E5E5"> they</font>

5
00:00:08,820 --> 00:00:11,160
make<font color="#CCCCCC"> you feel and what if they inspired</font>

6
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:13,769
you to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do so I guess write that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in the</font>

7
00:00:13,769 --> 00:00:15,570
comments<font color="#CCCCCC"> first of all I've already done</font>

8
00:00:15,570 --> 00:00:17,279
a video about my hero before which I

9
00:00:17,279 --> 00:00:19,529
will link in the description but I'll

10
00:00:19,529 --> 00:00:21,960
give a quick summary now when i was 13 i

11
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:24,900
listened to mainly 80s pop music and i

12
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:27,930
was at home and saw<font color="#E5E5E5"> a TV one day this</font>

13
00:00:27,930 --> 00:00:30,150
band called Fear Factory and they just

14
00:00:30,150 --> 00:00:32,040
released an album called digi mortal

15
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:34,469
which was about digital mortality what

16
00:00:34,469 --> 00:00:37,280
would life be like if you could download

17
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:41,370
your memory onto a hard disk with that

18
00:00:41,370 --> 00:00:44,550
then become your soul and there was a

19
00:00:44,550 --> 00:00:46,170
song on there called linchpin it was

20
00:00:46,170 --> 00:00:49,230
very heavy but the chorus was extremely

21
00:00:49,230 --> 00:00:51,059
melodic and it was just amazing now

22
00:00:51,059 --> 00:00:52,530
without giving too much<font color="#E5E5E5"> of a history</font>

23
00:00:52,530 --> 00:00:55,410
lesson<font color="#E5E5E5"> fifth actually started in 1989</font>

24
00:00:55,410 --> 00:00:57,539
and they were originally<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> death metal</font>

25
00:00:57,539 --> 00:00:59,670
band but they were the<font color="#E5E5E5"> first ever bands</font>

26
00:00:59,670 --> 00:01:03,930
to mix heavy vocals with melodic which

27
00:01:03,930 --> 00:01:06,090
is something you hear in music so much

28
00:01:06,090 --> 00:01:07,799
these days and a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of people</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> forget</font>

29
00:01:07,799 --> 00:01:09,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">where it originated from I started</font>

30
00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:11,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">buying their albums in reverse order and</font>

31
00:01:11,790 --> 00:01:14,159
the further back you go the heavier they

32
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:16,229
got so I was actually becoming subjected

33
00:01:16,229 --> 00:01:18,090
to heavy and heavier music and thus

34
00:01:18,090 --> 00:01:20,580
becoming a heavy<font color="#CCCCCC"> metal listener now my</font>

35
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:22,710
hero is the vocalist of this band Burton

36
00:01:22,710 --> 00:01:25,110
<font color="#CCCCCC">sebo and the way he writes his lyrics</font>

37
00:01:25,110 --> 00:01:26,909
the way he's passionate about what he

38
00:01:26,909 --> 00:01:28,710
believes in the way he tries<font color="#CCCCCC"> to change</font>

39
00:01:28,710 --> 00:01:31,530
the way people think and the way he

40
00:01:31,530 --> 00:01:33,720
unites people is<font color="#CCCCCC"> just a big inspiration</font>

41
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:36,119
to me now this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> a guy who performs to</font>

42
00:01:36,119 --> 00:01:38,909
hundreds of thousands of people and I

43
00:01:38,909 --> 00:01:40,350
thought I'm never going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get to speak</font>

44
00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:42,509
to this guy especially because I got

45
00:01:42,509 --> 00:01:44,340
into their music about<font color="#CCCCCC"> 10 years</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> down the</font>

46
00:01:44,340 --> 00:01:46,770
line well with the internet<font color="#E5E5E5"> and it being</font>

47
00:01:46,770 --> 00:01:49,079
my first internet success story I guess

48
00:01:49,079 --> 00:01:50,670
I actually managed<font color="#CCCCCC"> to get in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> contact</font>

49
00:01:50,670 --> 00:01:52,530
with him<font color="#E5E5E5"> and when he split up with their</font>

50
00:01:52,530 --> 00:01:54,990
factory in 2001 I helped<font color="#E5E5E5"> him with his</font>

51
00:01:54,990 --> 00:01:56,369
side project called<font color="#E5E5E5"> ascension the</font>

52
00:01:56,369 --> 00:01:58,549
Watchers if you could<font color="#E5E5E5"> go</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to myspace.com</font>

53
00:01:58,549 --> 00:02:03,180
/a o T W which stands for essentially

54
00:02:03,180 --> 00:02:04,710
watches and just leave a<font color="#E5E5E5"> comment letting</font>

55
00:02:04,710 --> 00:02:06,360
him know that I sent you that way that

56
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:09,899
would<font color="#CCCCCC"> be a really appreciate that and so</font>

57
00:02:09,899 --> 00:02:11,970
would he long story sure I was working

58
00:02:11,970 --> 00:02:13,040
in France for

59
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:15,110
six<font color="#E5E5E5"> months and I actually quit my job a</font>

60
00:02:15,110 --> 00:02:18,349
few weeks early just<font color="#CCCCCC"> so I could meet him</font>

61
00:02:18,349 --> 00:02:20,510
and he got me guest list and we met off

62
00:02:20,510 --> 00:02:22,189
the show and you<font color="#CCCCCC"> need to check the video</font>

63
00:02:22,189 --> 00:02:23,299
if you want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> find out the full story</font>

64
00:02:23,299 --> 00:02:26,090
but it changed my life they say you

65
00:02:26,090 --> 00:02:28,250
should never meet your<font color="#E5E5E5"> hero but I met</font>

66
00:02:28,250 --> 00:02:30,230
him because I wanted to<font color="#CCCCCC"> see</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> him as a</font>

67
00:02:30,230 --> 00:02:32,720
human and<font color="#CCCCCC"> not as just a depiction in my</font>

68
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:35,540
mind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> this great being who I treat it</font>

69
00:02:35,540 --> 00:02:38,900
as a god I guess and he was amazing<font color="#E5E5E5"> he</font>

70
00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:42,590
<font color="#CCCCCC">was so down to earth and we had a</font>

71
00:02:42,590 --> 00:02:44,540
brilliant all together and actually

72
00:02:44,540 --> 00:02:46,430
since then we've become really good

73
00:02:46,430 --> 00:02:49,849
friends and thinking about<font color="#E5E5E5"> it now I just</font>

74
00:02:49,849 --> 00:02:51,620
don't know how that happened and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font>

75
00:02:51,620 --> 00:02:53,480
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to say to anyone out there now you</font>

76
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:56,000
know this was what was<font color="#CCCCCC"> the Eureka moment</font>

77
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,739
I guess<font color="#E5E5E5"> for the internet and me learning</font>

78
00:02:57,739 --> 00:02:59,930
its potential you know there<font color="#CCCCCC"> are so many</font>

79
00:02:59,930 --> 00:03:01,400
people out there but if you want

80
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:03,139
<font color="#E5E5E5">something if you want to think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

81
00:03:03,139 --> 00:03:04,700
badly if you want to get in contact with

82
00:03:04,700 --> 00:03:06,650
someone there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> always a way but by all</font>

83
00:03:06,650 --> 00:03:08,840
means do not stalk people you know you

84
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:10,909
got you got to find the<font color="#E5E5E5"> balance there's</font>

85
00:03:10,909 --> 00:03:12,650
a healthy balance so where's this video

86
00:03:12,650 --> 00:03:14,480
going they're releasing an album on

87
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:17,060
februari the eighth in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the UK called</font>

88
00:03:17,060 --> 00:03:20,239
mechanized and all I<font color="#E5E5E5"> can say is it's an</font>

89
00:03:20,239 --> 00:03:23,209
amazing album and every album they have

90
00:03:23,209 --> 00:03:27,260
done has had its own feel and its own

91
00:03:27,260 --> 00:03:29,810
meaning behind it and this album is

92
00:03:29,810 --> 00:03:31,849
about how a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of predictions from</font>

93
00:03:31,849 --> 00:03:33,739
sci-fi writers of the past have actually

94
00:03:33,739 --> 00:03:35,900
become true you know the future that

95
00:03:35,900 --> 00:03:38,269
they predicted exists in today's society

96
00:03:38,269 --> 00:03:40,790
and what I wanted to do to help spread

97
00:03:40,790 --> 00:03:43,159
<font color="#CCCCCC">the message of the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> album and actually to</font>

that are brought up in it the singers

105
00:03:59,359 --> 00:04:01,819
