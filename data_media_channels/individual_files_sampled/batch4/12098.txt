an extensive survey of Yale's incoming freshman class has found that the class of 2022 will be quote the most diverse in university history there'll be 5% homosexual 9% bisexual or transsexual 8% asexual and 3% unwilling to answer the question which sounds pretty quois sexual to me also they're all leftists we will analyze the increasingly homogenous diversity on campus and what can be done about it then speaking of diversity the Dalai Lama defends nationalism in Europe drink up folks and Twitter bans old speak finally the mailbag I'm Michel Knowles and this is the Michael Nolt show by the way I'd like to make a correction I'm sorry I how insensitive of me I use the word freshmen to describe the incoming class obviously fresh man is a sexist term so I should say fresh person well well except of course that son is a sexist term too so I guess it should be fresh per daughter the Fred the Yale fresh / daughter class will analyze the incoming fresh bird otter class but first I've

here it happening all the crystals in the chakras just going at a lot of people they were doing their Sun Salutations now they're doing downward-facing dog because the Dali Lama is defending nationalism in Europe this is a beautiful thing it's one of those news stories where do I care what the Dalai Lama says not really do I even care that much about what's going on in European politics not really but when these things align up like this it is just too good because every little hippie dippie unshowered you know wild-haired weirdo walking around Los Angeles with their Bernie bumper stickers on is now gonna be very upset they all do yoga yoga has become the the Church of Millennials and the Dalai Lama defending nationalism which makes perfect sense he probably was listening to our show yesterday and that's why he did it because we've been talking about nationalism now for a couple of days and and by the way if that I don't know if the Dalai Lama is looking for a new job but my own church the Catholic Church could use some new bishops and it sounds like this guy's at least right about a few things so and maybe it consider applying the Dalai Lama was a conference in Sweden yesterday this was three days after the right wing party in Sweden which is called the Sweden Democrats I see why that's confusing but they're the right wing party there they did very well in the general elections and so he was speaking in Sweden and I think that left was expecting him to say look for reject right-wing politics didn't open borders man come on let's all you know kumbaya but he didn't say that he said quote Europe belongs to the Europeans receive them help them educate them but ultimately they should develop their own country with regard to the Islamic refugees the immigrants who are over there Europe belongs to the Europeans this is a truism this shouldn't be a controversial statement of course that's true Europe belongs to the Europeans America belongs to the Americans China belongs to the Chinese why that that is the Nick the definition of the nation but now to say that is controversial it's seen as racist I don't know how it's racist there are a lot of different races in Europe but somehow that's considered racist now because you have floods and floods of Islamic migrants coming across borders in Europe and flooding these countries in many cases invading these countries with the protection of the European Union with the encouragement of the European Union there was that great book on it the strange death of Europe by Douglas Murray I think it came out a little while ago excellent book on this topic talks about whole Italian towns being overrun by Islamic migrants coming across borders and what the Dalai Lama is defending here is the right of European nations to remain European nations I get why the left is surprised by this because the Dalai Lama is a cool like hippie dippie guy if anybody's gonna be a nationalist it's gonna be the Dalai Lama he has been fighting for the right of the nation of Tibet against the imperial encroachments of China for all of our lifetimes he went on he said quote I think Europe belongs to the Europeans they ultimately should rebuild their own country and he said by the way this wasn't just a reaction to Trump it's not like he is playing some political game and you say oh I see Trump is popular okay I'll mimic him in 2016 before Donald Trump was elected the Dalai Lama said quote Europe for example Germany cannot become an Arab country Germany is Germany there are so many that in practice it becomes difficult meaning there are so many migrants coming across the border he said as we all feel when we look into the face of every single refugee especially the children and women we can feel their suffering and therefore we should help them of course we should help them the goal however should be that they return and help rebuild their countries end quote that again should not be controversial when we're talking about refugees why would we have refugees come over from a totally foreign region of the world to a totally foreign region of the world rather than people within their own neighborhoods helping to take care of them why wouldn't we want to rebuild those countries perhaps there is a problem in certain cultures there perhaps there are conflicts among cultures over there why would we import wholesale unvetted those sort of cultural problems this is this used to be a progressive position this used to be a accepted by the left and the right because in the old days you had imperialism and then in the wake of the Second World War we we had a surge of nationalism India becomes a nation the countries in the Middle East get to become their own nations countries in Africa this was the height of freedom because the nation can protect Liberty for individuals for communities for different groups without descending into anarchy on the one hand or becoming oppressive and imperial on the other hand so I understand that the orthodoxy of the left right now is that we need to become one world government under a totally benevolent Empire oh it'll be different this time it'll be totally benevolent but perhaps the left should look to some of the people that for a long time it's admired like Dalai Lama to see where they've gone so so wrong and in the meantime we can fill up our leftist ears so the Dalai Lama is on one side of that Twitter is now on the other Twitter banned the phrase in its advertising platform it banned the phrase illegal alien because that's hate speech that's hateful content now you can't say illegal alien illegal alien is not a hateful phrase illegal alien is the precise technical term for illegal aliens that all the other things are euphemisms dreamer undocumented future whatever that that those are euphemisms that don't precisely describe what we're talking about illegal alien does but Twitter doesn't care to Jack Dorsey the head of Twitter basically admitted to shadow banning six hundred thousand accounts because Twitter is an international company abused itself as an international company it doesn't have bonds of national loyalty when the right and the left at various points complain about multinational corporations they do have one point which is that these super national extra transnational organizations don't have the same priorities that you and I do because they don't have current loyalty to communities in two states in two countries they're they're bigger than that and this brings us to the Yale of it all because Gail calls itself even in recent years even when I was there they call it themselves a global University not an American University a global University the catch phrase for Yale used to be for God for country and for Yale in that order but now that it's not the case now it is an international university it touts all the time how many foreign international students are coming in there and always trying to increase that number in part because they pay a lot of money to go and there was a magazine when I was there I think it still exists called the Yale Global that was and that was the very fashionable magazine to write for as an undergraduate and now they talk about the most diverse class ever and you say oh good oh thank goodness because all I'm hearing is this one point of view this one perspective the global university the globalist the left-wing progressive oh good now we have some diversity what diversity do we get so when it comes to sexual diversity the old line at Yale was one in four maybe more for gay students and now the numbers are almost exactly that in terms of students who are not straight of students who have more creative sexual preferences if the number actually is close to one in four this is no surprise this is going on a long time you know Yale did turn out Cole Porter I think American Psycho said that that Yale thing is when you have either repressed homosexuality or a cocaine addiction maybe both I don't know but when it when you get down to intellectual diversity ideological philosophical diversity this this wide-ranging study found that just 9% of Yale incoming students consider themselves somewhat conservative and just 2% consider themselves very conservative and let me translate that for you haven't been familiar with how this goes somewhat conservative at Yale means that you don't think that Mitt Romney is Hitler that's that's what's somewhat conservative means very conservative means I don't know that you registered as a Republican at 18 I think that probably counts it you know you have some you have a an American flag bowtie or something that that's like very very conservative and so we're talking about 2% of pretty serious conservatives there there is very little intellectual diversity same thing on the faculty I saw some conservative faculty members or would-be faculty members get run out of town a 2016 survey by the Yale Daily News shows that 95 percent of conservative students felt that their views were unwelcome at Yale and I don't want to beat up on Yale too much but the reason that this is a national story is that Yale is representative not just of some school in New Haven but of all of these campuses across the country with a very few exceptions they are all being overrun by the left they're all indoctrinated rather and educating to increasing degrees and we've got to find a way to stop this you remember you know you the craziness that kind of typifies the craziness on all campuses but it really was most prevalent I think at dear old New Haven was shrieking girl they came out a few years ago just to refresh your memory and because I need a little refill on my tumblr take it away shrieking part of this video it's a very distressing video but my favorite part is that guy at the end the advocate guy because you know he was just standing there everyone's yelling everyone's strings like alright Johnny this is your chance this is your chance to finally watch well what am i oh I'll say yeah that he was supposed to be our advocate all right everyone's talking all right here you were supposed to be all right but uh nobody's talking anymore oh it's so embarrassing so awkward and the girl this girl should have been expelled right Geralyn Luther should have been expelled for this that is so horrific ly disrespectful all of the students involved screaming at their professor should have been expelled on the spot what happened instead the students who led this revolt on campus were given awards at their graduation they were given awards this is a really horrifying turn of events you're seeing the American University not just at Yale but all around the country imploding and we're very lucky because there is a guy who is running for the Yale Board of Trustees on a campaign to turn this around to make sure that events like this never happen again not at Yale and hopefully this can be a signal to all of the universities around the country to stop this Jamie Couric is an American reporter foreign correspondent candidate for the Yale Board of Trustees I spoke to him last week here's Jamie Jamie thank you so much for being here thanks for having me so Jamie obviously I feel a personal connection to your campaign because you're running for the Yale corporation for the Yale Board of Trustees but I think your campaign and the issues you're talking about actually reflect a national trend that's going on on colleges that's going on at universities across the country oh why are you running for the Yale Board of Trustees well like you say I think our university to play a major role in educating future leaders and Yale in particular in the Ivy League and a lot of the ideas that come out of universities that become popular and universities eventually seep their way into the general public and I think over the past couple of years we've seen at Yale and many other universities growing in tolerance for differing viewpoints and not necessarily conservative viewpoints by the way I mean the clip that you just showed you know it wasn't a right wing professor being yelled at it was a liberal one so things are I think getting out of hand you know just two weeks ago we had this huge or last week excuse me this huge controversy with The New Yorker canceling an interview with with Steve Bannon I'm no fan of Steve Ben and I have criticized him many times in print but to pretend that you know he or his ideas you know don't exist another not influential and they actually haven't been used to win elections and major countries across the Western world you know from a left-wing perspective I don't see how that actually helps you to just sort of put your fingers in your ears and pretend that these things don't exist and wish them to go away so I've been really disappointed that what I see is the kind of climate of growing intellectual intolerance on the under Yale campus in particular but also across the country and I think that you know alumni of these institutions really need to try to exercise some more influence because they're really the only part they're the only constituency of the university I think has any chances of fixing this that's absolutely right when a few years ago when we saw that clip from Yale the girl you know this is not an intellectual space this is not a home and you know shrieking at her making profanity at her professor you've seen this happen so many other places as well one thing I love about your candidacy is that you're not some rock-ribbed conservative I don't think you're a hard-line Republican in your own way and yet you're you're reflective of this view now in the center and among independents and reasonable minded people that even if I disagree with speech we should permit free speech especially on a campus right yeah no I mean I'm probably the center maybe vaguely center-right politically I voted for Hillary Clinton I'm endorsed so just to give your listeners an idea I'm will forgiving I've lived over season um like I've lived overseas I lived in you know other democratic countries that don't have the same culture of free speech that the United States does and I really just come to appreciate how lucky we are and of course you know I do we hear things that we don't like absolutely you know Alex Jones is sort of the cost of free speech it's the crazy homeless guy you know shouting you know curses at you as you as you go to work but you have to put up with that you can't just put the homeless guy in prison for screaming something that you don't like and so I really am an absolutist when it when it comes to this I think it's a small el liberal position I think it's a position that frankly throughout history it's usually been people on the Left whose free speech has been quashed I mean if you go back to you know the the Palmer Raids afterworld around World War One car theism the various you know very controversial art exhibitions that were put up during the 80s and 90s it's usually people on the left but now I think that the left has basically come to dominate media academia cultural institutions they've now come to dominate these institutions they are now in absolute total control and I it's just unfortunate to see that they haven't really learned the lessons that you know when they were in need of people to defend their free speech they're now completely flipped that's examined and they're going after anyone yeah yeah well if a university doesn't have the free exchange of ideas then where is going to have a free exchange of ideas you know I'm sure people are looking at your candidacy and they're saying what can we do what can we do to help bring the universities and liberal education back from the brink so my question is two parts one what will you do when you're on the Yale corporation board and what can other people do who are alumni of other universities or who are at other universities to try to stop all the censorship stop the screaming stop the degradation of the liberal education culture and actually reclaim the free exchange of ideas I think the universities need to stop putting up basically kicked me signs on their backs and they need to make it very clear the administrators need to make it very clear to incoming freshman you know these are our values we believe in free speech aren't going to be you're happy to be shouting down speakers and so there's a very excellent letter that was you know written by believe the Dean of Students at the University of Chicago and it was sent out to every incoming freshman and it's very it's very blunt and it says there's no there's no trigger warnings there's no stage spaces this is a place for intellectual development and debate I think students coming to Chicago they already understand this and if they if they really don't like it then they're not going to go to Chicago and so I really would like to see one you know if I'm um if I'm elected to the board I would I would urge the president of Yale the Dean of Students to send out similar letters Yale actually has an excellent policy on this Woodward report it was published in 1974 after some very high-profile controversial speakers and and and riots grew up around that the university commissioned this report and it's really looked and cited upon as being one of the best expressions in defense of free speech in an academic setting I would send that to every incoming freshman perhaps there's a program that Princeton has where they assign all the incoming freshmen to books that are basically you know pro and con on a very contentious subject like abortion say a book that's in favor of abortion rights and one that is against it and all the incoming freshmen no matter what they're majoring in even if they're going to be majoring in you know astronomy or whatever they they have to read these books and will be a classroom discussion about it just to sort of get them in in the mood and to inculcate these values so those are some of the ideas that I've brought forth and then you know for me personally I'd love it if your listeners if they know people who went to Yale they did go to Yale go to the website Jamie for trusty comm they can sign sign my petition to get me on the ballot and I would just encourage people you know most universities they have similar bodies like the Yale corporation they have boards of trustees they have governing bodies on which alumni sit and play a role so that's you know do what I'm doing run run to be on the board of trustees you can also frankly put your money where your mouth is and if the university that you are an alum of is not you know behaving or not not defending Enlightenment values like you want them to and make it clear to the financial office the giving office that you're not going to be donating anymore and that's ultimately what might have to happen in order for you know real serious positive change to take place that that is such a good point I love it when the fundraising committee calls me and they ask for my annual $20 that I donate to dear old Yale and and I say no you're not getting it this year shut down the programs and I go on my long lecture because you see this at a lot of institutions even outside of education you hear a get woke go broke people are really they don't want this oppressive censorious politics of division shoved in their face all the time and so I hope it's very important if you do know anybody who went to Yale or is it Yale or whatever make sure you go to Jamie for trustee calm because I think this is going to send a message nationally you mentioned you Chicago they had a great statement on free speech Purdue University under mitch Daniels had a great statement on free speech and Yale is not living up to the Woodward report they're not defending free speech so I wonder you know when when the right sort of lost any influence at all at universities they started think tanks there are other alternatives to traditional four-year college degrees are we going to see a shift away if the colleges remain totally opposed to free ideas politicized increasingly ideological majors are we gonna see some new competing form of education crop up or are we consign to just this left-wing malaise that's going to get worse and worse and and more since aureus as time goes on I think we're already seeing perhaps the early development of this one in sort of the formation of this hetero Dobbs Academy and this whole intellectual dark web and people are seeming to you know there's clearly a lot of interest in this and a lot of people are kind of becoming autodidact you know and they're educating themselves outside of the traditional university structures the other development that I would say indicates it's something that used to just might be happening is we're seeing a lot of Millennials you know leave college with these are very expensive four-year degrees in various you know very obscure subjects and they're not getting jobs and they're living with their parents and I think it's eventually going to dawn on people that the education that they're getting in some of these schools are just not marketable in a free society perhaps this is one of the reasons why Millennials are increasingly attracted toward socialism because they're not making this connection they're not making this connection in their head they feel very aggrieved and resentful that you know the four-year degree that they got in performative puppetry or whatever is not translating into a hundred thousand dollar a year job right out of school and so rather than say well maybe I shouldn't have gotten this useless degree perhaps I you know I'm gonna blame society and I'm gonna demand you know socialism and free education and free this and free that so I think we're already seeing the sort of the understanding that something is off that you know Peter Thiel has referred to a higher education bubble I think there is something like that going on and you know if it's going to explode or how that's going to develop is you know anyone's guess well as a transformative puppetry minor I have to tell you the job market was really tough on me when I got out of dear old college I noticed that you have you seem to have done well for yourself yeah well the key was that I didn't write a book that was the real it was the one good idea I had I noticed you have very strange-looking wallpaper behind you that's because you're coming to us from the middle of nowhere somewhere on the other side of the earth I'm at I'm at a conference in the nation of Georgia it's not the US stage it's about ten years ago just last month you'll remember was invaded and occupied by by Russia 20% of its territory so they come here every year for a conference I think it's a very it's a great country great people freedom-loving very pro-american very westward looking and I always try to come to this conference every year to really remind myself what America's role in the world should be so what what freedom means more important now than ever before perhaps so Jaime I'm gonna let you go I know it's about midnight over there where you are so go keep it up if you are a lino yaly go to Jamie for trustee calm and help out try to spur similar campaigns at your college at your University because that's the only way we're gonna restore some sanity to the campuses Jamie thanks so much for being here thanks for having me alright we've got a lot more to get to I'm finally leaving enough time to do the mailbag I always don't leave enough time and then there are like five minutes left and I speed through them but I'm finally leaving enough time so go to daily wired.com if you're on facebook and youtube i'm shocked to hear it if you're on Daily wire thank you help us keep the lights on in Co FFA in my cup go over there it's ten bucks a month $100 for an annual membership what do you get what don't you get what don't you get these days you get me you get the under Clavin sure you get the Ben Shapiro show you get the Matt Walsh show you get to ask questions in the mailbag which is coming up you get to ask questions in the conversation the big boss Ben Shapiro is coming up this month I believe and none of that matters because you get this special Dali Lama edition of leftist tears he's causing them he's not the one producing them do you remember I think it was about 20 years ago when the Dalai Lama did a Rolex ad you know he was wearing a Rolex or something this is this is the new conspicuous consumption piece that you need the leftist here's tumbler we should do like a gold-plated one or something like that go get it it's the only fda-approved vessel of salty delicious left as tears which we're gonna get a lot of Jamie wins Thank You Board of Trustees which is just a lovely thing it's a lovely thing when sort of people in the centre liberals center left center right when they are like considered to the right of Genghis Khan which is the culture that we're in though excuse me go to daily we're calm we'll be right back with the mailbag jumping right em from Nathan hey Michael a few weeks ago you suggested I start reading CS Louis with mere Christianity and I'm about done with it incredible read so far there is one part I wanted to ask your opinion on in his section on pride he talks about looking down on people making it impossible to look up toward God does God really expect us to look down on no one is it really conceit phul to think I am better than a person who skin's 30 people alive and then sleeps soundly or that I'm better than the person I was in the past it seems to me that if we can't think our selves superior to at least some others without the sin of pride the concept of trying to be a good person loses meaning I see why this is confusing I have a solution the issue here is not that you should think less of yourself it's that you should think of yourself less and that will solve the problem if you're sitting there thinking or thinking well how should I think about me and how should I think about my relation to other people and where I am in the pecking order of the hierarchy of people you're doing it wrong pride is the queen of all sins this is the hardest one to root out because it is the essential sin it is the the original sin the the cause of the original sin is pride wanting to elevate yourself thinking of yourself a man wrapped up in himself makes a very small package indeed it was the fall of Satan of Lucifer from heaven it's so insidious is always waiting there for you and you know the more humble you think you've become the more prideful you'll be in your humility so the key is to think of yourself less think about other people more think of yourself less you will have a better life we all fall into pride from time to time but pride will make you miserable the more you think about yourself you think it's gonna make you happy because you feel really good you think oh you know I I hit a home run today in baseball that never happened to me obviously but you know you think I'm really cool I'm a real cool guy and the more you do that the more miserable you'll be the less you think about yourself the more joyful you'll be from Ryan I'm a Catholic and I feel that pledging allegiance to the flag is idolatrous as a result I feel that I shouldn't say the Pledge or place my hand over my heart I do love my country but my allegiance is only to God can you explain why this is permissible love this show absolutely the pledge of allegiance is a wonderful thing do you have any allegiance to your wife you have any allegiance to your parents or your kids or your family or your community do you have any ally of course we have loyalty to many different things and not not all equally you know I have a loyalty to my broom closet you know this is my community here that I'm locked up in all day and of course everybody has a loyalty to your family to your community to your state to your country and ultimately to God that's perfectly fine it's only a crazy rationalism that makes us pretend that we can only be loyal to one thing you know Christ tells us in Scripture that you unless you hate your father and your mother and your family you can't follow him but God also tells us that husbands should love their wives how do you resolve these things rationalists want to pick one or the other but what both are doing is telling us a spiritual truth we have many loyalties and allegiances but we have to keep them in the proper order and our pledge of allegiance is a wonderful expression of that because our pledge of allegiance keeps it in order we pledge allegiance to one nation under God indivisible with liberty and justice for all we actually clarified it in 1954 to add in under God to make it clear that we're not committing some heresy or making an idol out of our nation but that we have a natural loyalty to our communities and clans and you know groupings and ultimately into the nation and all of that is under God and America has been guided so clearly by Providence since her very beginning that it's a wonderful thing to pledge allegiance and to know that all of that allegiance is ordered and under and looking up to God from Nathan a lot of Nathan's coming in today hey Michael equestria that free will how do you square the concepts of an omniscient God and me having free choice both are fundamental to our religion but I don't see how I can have real unless God does not know what I'm going to do next for example Judas Iscariot needed to betray Christ in the order for the crucifixion to take place Christ said he knew about it beforehand so could you Judas have chosen to do otherwise did God create Judas knowing for certain he would go to hell or Pontius Pilate for that matter because then he would know for all of us and my choices can't change anything any advice god bless yes all of heresy comes from impatience with mystery I think just about all of it comes from that it comes from not being able to resolve how God can have a perfect justice and perfect mercy how we can have a there can be perfect grace and perfect freewill and so what happens is people who want to rationalize their way out of that pick one or the other but it isn't one or the other Thomas Aquinas could give you a much better version of this than I could and there isn't enough time to go into it but I'll give you a little trick or a shortcut on this which is the question of time and space this this I I never really understood the confusion on freewill and be omniscience of God because God is outside of time and space and I'm inside of time and space so I'm here in time and space and I have my free choice and I'm choosing to do things but from the perspective outside of time and space you see all those choices as having already happened even my language is misleading here because I'm speaking in tenses that have to do with time and we're talking about something outside of time but those are different perspectives the perspective of being inside of time and space and the perspective of being outside of it those of those can simultaneously be true I can live my life freely and have free choice and have free will and someone who is outside of time can see what has happened what is happening and what will happen all at the same time outside of which he is this came into great confusion during the Protestant revolution you know I criticize Martin Luther a little bit on the show on occasion this time it's no different Luther and Calvin both came down on the side that there is no such thing as free will they denied free will Luther in his writings disagreeing with Erasmus and John Calvin in his doctrine of predestination but human freedom is very very important it is the the central fact that that we have here that we are in possession of that leads to our happiness in the world free choices what caused the fall and forget you you're talking about how it caused Judas you know God knew that Judas would betray him but go all the way back to the fall God knew that Adam would sin God knew that mankind would fall and because of Adams free will we had the fall and because of the fall we got the Incarnation because of the Incarnation we got the crucifixion and we got the resurrection we got the happy fall we got a wonderful joy the greatest story ever told the greatest possible world that's because we have free will and because of the grace of God you see this in the Incarnation when the angel comes down it says to Mary hail Mary full of grace you will conceive a child even though you haven't known a man you will conceive a child and and you are blessed and that was the grace God comes down the mountain you see all of this grace but then Mary consents to it she says I am The Lord's servant let it be done according to your word she can all of Heaven is holding its breath God and His omniscience knew what she was going to say but she still has that opportunity to ascend to turn toward God or turn away from God and we can do that all of the time and just because someone outside of the perspective of time knows what you're going to do doesn't mean that you aren't really doing it from Bob hi Michael I'm an atheist and support abortion within the first trimester or beyond it given the rise of specific circumstances case in point personal friend decided on an abortion when she learned that a medication she was temporarily taking caused birth deformities she was married at the time and later conceived and gave birth to healthy properly developed babies would you have preferred to see her forced to carry to term a malformed child well I would prefer if she didn't kill the child yeah because nobody's perfect are you perfect are you were you properly formed I've given your question I wonder if you were properly formed what do you mean perfect what baby is perfect should we now went so you're saying the baby had a deformity let's say it was missing a finger or something should we should we kill babies that don't have fingers should we kill adults who are missing a finger what if the baby has Down syndrome should we kill people with Down syndrome plenty of villains throughout history have killed mentally retarded people people with mental deficiencies is that what you suggest we do it what about physical ones what I'm not a great athlete should what should I be wiped out maybe my mother could have tried again the doctor could have looked in and said oh you know he's okay he's got really poufy hair you should have nice oily swarthy skin but he's not gonna be much of an athlete he's gonna be pretty slow and you know he'll probably strike out most times in baseball just say okay get like get rid of him we'll try again is that it nobody suggests that nobody thinks we should do that you've got to follow the logic of these to their logical conclusion if we were perfect if we were all perfect then maybe there would be something to your argument but then you wouldn't have an argument at all and then this we live in a fallen world and getting back to that first question we talked about perhaps we should stop thinking so much of ourselves and start looking at our own deficiencies and and therefore having a little more grace for other people from where from Benjamin from Benjamin hey Michael I am in week three of my first semester at a very left-wing college here in California I'm going to begin to bring my leftist tears tumbler to school so I can sip on Co FFA to keep me awake during my 8:00 a.m. class if that's so good I love it if a classmate presumably a lefty asks me about my tumblr how would you respond so I can keep a potential friendship while explaining the wonders of this tumblr thanks Benjamin this is a win win you've put yourself in a win-win scenario you're sitting there in class day little you take a little Dalai Lama step and your classmate comes up to you and says what's that your answer has to be this is a leftist here's tumblr and if the person has a sense of humor left or right they would laugh and say ha ha ha that's pretty funny if they don't have a sense of humor you probably don't want to be friends with them anyway and you'll get a free refill of your leftist tears this is the perfect scenario to Veon i how if only i could go back to college what a great time that was we still have a little bit of time I'm gonna go through a few more from Veronica hey Mikey poo hey Veronica Ron Ron how you doing I would like the inside scoop on how to do New York City I want to see cool things but avoid crowds and tourists and I would like to not go broke sorry go to Chicago do you want me to tell you give me the ultimate guide to the Big Apple if you're really from there since there's an epidemic of people lying about their origins these days I'm as I was actually born in Kenya so okay I hope to tell you about that thanks doll yeah you bet thanks Veronica so you're there's no way to do New York without going broke it's an expensive place and there's a lot of fun stuff to do so just do it one thing you can do and you also can't have all you want to avoid the crowds you don't want to go broke you want man that though you can't do all those together the cheapest thing you can do that's pretty cool is very early in the morning get on the Staten Island Ferry and you will get a free view of the Statue of Liberty it is zero dollars to get on there will be a crowd but it's pretty cool I used to do it back in my heart or partying days I would after a nice long night of going out on the town having a couple adult beverages some friends and I would get on the Staten Island Ferry right at sunrise and you get to see the Sun Rise you get to see the Statue of Liberty you get to go eat a sandwich in Staten Island and then immediately get back on the Staten Island Ferry you know go back and so that's a fun thing to do it's always bad to ask a New Yorker what to do in New York because I've I've lived in New York for most of my life in the city outside the city around you know nearby I've never been to the Empire State Building I have never I have not been in the New World Trade Center building even though I lived a block away from it I had never been inside the old World Trade Center the twin towers I've never been to the Statue of Liberty Island never gone there never done a carriage ride and you know all the things that the tourists want to do none of us ever ever do there so my recommendation I'm just gonna I'm gonna give you what I do when I go to New York and take it for what it's worth I always I go to the great cigar bars cigar in on 50 and second Kornegay club it's a little pricier but they have a great centrist Saturday I'll go to Keens Steakhouse it's the greatest steakhouse in the world then if you want a bagel early in the morning go down to Leo's downtown it's by the World Trade Center and there's a great boozy brunch at Harry's Steakhouse down there and the finest bar in all of New York the most degenerate disgusting despicable den of debauchery is the iron horse on Fulton what is a Fulton and cliff I think they used to like the bar on fire a couple times a night I think now they've stopped doing that but you know they have like a pool table and mean-looking biker dudes and it's just terrific it's a great time it's great to walk in there and you're a little like polo shirt at Oxford you know the loafers hey fellas how you doing great bar do that let me know it how you enjoyed it from Austin dear Archangel Michael look-alike not it not after a night at the Iron Horse let me tell you that defender of conservatism protector of the Ben Shapiro show broom closet I require your expertise in relationships bring it on I've been single for awhile about two years and it found myself falling for two women one is currently in the Navy Academy and the other is pursuing education to become a psychiatrist I hold both as close friends and care for both of them equally I am at the point where I want to date for marriage and not just for a hooker I live in Pennsylvania so I won't be able to see the girl in the Navy Academy much but the psychiatrist to be has a few extracurricular activities that I'm not entirely kosher with pot the old Haitian oregano but she lives just a short drive away thanks for all your help you are truly deserving of the title cousin of the daily wire much-loved Austin but I don't know so this is a I'll give you my advice trying to calibrate how much I can say you always want to be honest you want to be you don't want to be a jerk about dating girls but if you're not sure who you want to date then you should spend a little time with both girls you know being honest they'll go to dinner or get that you know kind of get to know you don't I don't know your age if you're 18 or something you don't have to make a decision right away I I don't know enough about the girl so I mean all I know is one girl's going on Naval Academy that's great good good honor and the other girls a psychiatrist I've always had a preference for psychiatrists the pot thing I don't know if she's in college that could pass by you know I mean who knows in the culture now marijuana is becoming a sacrament so perhaps perhaps we'll all end up puffing on the old Haitian oregano I prefer coffe FA but you it's all it's about the girls you know I gave this advice to some other guy you got to tell me about the person don't don't date someone or marry someone because of their job or how much money they're gonna make or if they're gonna travel or whatever you know because they like to smoke pot when they're 18 it's it's about the person and that's ineffable I can't tell you about that the way that you can find that out though is by talking to the girls honestly you know being interested in what they have to do trying to learn about them trying to get a sense of them and seeing what clicks because there is a little chemistry this isn't so clinical I know now we're in the swipe culture but colporteur didn't sing let's do it let's be in a an exclusive relationship after we date for a little while because we swiped right on tinder that's not what he said it's and let's do it let's fall in love so you that's the that's really what you've got to focus on a little bit just don't be a jerk about it don't you know try we've all been jerks when it comes to girls but try not to be and depending on your age you might be a little old for that anyway so you know find out what what that person is and don't don't go in saying I want to date because I need a girlfriend and I want to get married and me me me me me it's about the other person go in enjoy it keep it fun if dating isn't fun then I got nothing for you you know that's the great consolation of life do we have time for one more one more okay is that enough all right from Matthew Michael I really enjoy the show and it has become my favorite daily wire podcast yeah do you hear that Ben no he - Ben doesn't listen to this show whenever I tell people about the daily wire I always tell them I came for Ben stayed for Michael thank you very much anyway my question refers to the fall of Adam and Eve more specifically is there any extra biblical anthropological or historical evidence to support the claim of the fall there were ones to first people who were in a perfect state of grace and would never have died had they not sinned and disobeyed God if there is no evidence for this how would we argue for it to a secular person especially since their argument from a Darwinian perspective seems more tenable though it does not explain the desire for meaning and the fact we have a consciousness yeah seems like a conundrum I look forward to hearing your answer and keep up the good work respectfully men so we cannot know about the garden we can't know about pre-fall everything that we have in front of us is a product of the fall our minds are a product of the fall our you know we are in a fallen world we are not we're not in a fallen world that has a perfect place somewhere in the middle of Iraq that's not how it works we were kicked out of the garden there is an angel with a flaming sword so I have a few thoughts on all of this broadly speaking if you're looking to the Bible for science or you know scientific history or scientific fact you're looking in the wrong place I think it was a carnal cardinal for where I'm gonna get it wrong a cardinal Boronia s wasn't maybe who knows I'll look it up who said the Bible teaches us how to go to heaven not how the heavens go so just keep that in mind nevertheless because the Bible contains myth and history and poetry and history and all of these things and journalism and theology because it contains all of these genres I know that the biblical description of the creation is the most precise and truthful way that I can understand the creation of being of the universe that's that is the most precise way there were a more precise way if there were a better way to do it God would have told us in that way so I know that for a fact now I'm gonna violate what I just said which is that I'll analyze it from an anthropological or historical or scientific perspective at CS Lewis did this in some book I forget where maybe it was Chesterton that the the fact of the first person is a truism certainly there was a first man there has to have been because even assuming you refer to it as the Darwinian perspective and people abuse that term endlessly but even assuming that there was some sort of evolutionary process some process of natural selection at a certain point a distinction was made between a beast who is all instinct and a human being which has intellect and will at a certain point a distinction was made in a way that we can imagine this is God reaching down and touching Adam with God touching the man and him having a consciousness him having intellect and will and being more than a grunting brute who is driven only by instinct by definition that's the first man so certainly that is the case and so even if you want to follow the evolutionary perspective or one of the many evolutionary perspectives you still have to butt up against that fact of the first man and but your understanding of it will be much better if you focus on that consciousness and what it means to be a man and what the fall means and what it means for us today as we live we live as conscious beings with intellect and will I hope that's I hope I was able to sum up the creation of mankind in 20 seconds they're not do you think I succeeded I don't think I did but hopefully that helps okay that's our show you've got a binge another Kingdom season one because we are vigorously recording season
