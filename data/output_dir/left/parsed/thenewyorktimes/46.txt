Donald Trump thinks he’s
making America great again
like this.
A little bit of this.
“Our nation — "
“Honey, I’m calling ICE."
Ugh.
And this.
It’s a throwback to
another era, when things
were black and mostly white.
Not really our idea of great.
“Make America great again."
But Trump has achieved
something significant,
and he deserves credit.
But it’s the same
kind of credit
Inspector Gadget deserves
for unintentionally
solving a crime.
All right, hear me out.
During Obama’s eight years
of competent, scandal-free
leadership, democracy was
very much a spectator sport.
In the 2014 midterm
elections, Democrats
had so much
confidence in Obama,
they didn’t even bother
to show up at the polls,
turning out the lowest
number of voters in 70 years.
“A goddamn disaster
for Democrats.
They got destroyed."
Which just so happened to
give Republicans the edge
to block Obama’s Supreme
Court pick, Merrick Garland,
in 2016.
And now, Trump is forcing us
to engage in our democracy
like many never have before.
For instance, contrast their
very different reactions
to the most mind boggling,
only-in-America dilemma —
mass shootings.
"(SINGING) Amazing grace ..."
I mean, he breaks into a
pitch-perfect rendition
of "Amazing Grace."
You can’t get
better than that.
He insisted
Congress take action
and ban assault-style weapons
and high-capacity magazines.
He even signed 23
executive actions.
And then, nothing changed.
Not a single law
or reform was made
to address our gun crisis.
Was our faith in Obama so
profound that we forgot
to do something ourselves?
Enter 45.
“To help secure our
schools and tackle
the difficult issue
of mental health ... "
Trump, with his total lack of
actual solutions on our gun
crisis, inspired this.
After years of
nothing, Florida
raised the legal age for
buying a firearm from 18
to 21 and banned bump stocks.
Stock prices soared
for sports stores
that stopped selling
assault-style rifles.
Even several gun owners
destroyed their own weapons
for the cause.
Where was this
urgency after Orlando?
San Bernardino?
Aurora?
Charleston?
Sandy Hook?
All right, now,
before you start
ranting about normalization,
let me be clear.
I have no delusions about
the destructive force
of a narcissist for president,
for reproductive rights,
for public schools, for
immigrants, for the planet.
However, something important
and desperately needed
is also happening.
Americans are taking a stand.
And it’s much more than guns.
Witnessing a self-admitted
sexual assaulter
win the presidency
pushed us over the edge
to finally tackle decades
of silence around sexism.
“Allegations by
numerous women who
say the Hollywood mogul — "
“Harvey Weinstein
in handcuffs."
“CBS News has suspended
our co-host Charlie Rose — "
And the sea change goes
beyond calling out gross men.
More women than ever
are entering politics —
nearly 600 in total for 2018.
And we’ve already seen
some early primary wins.
Oh, and way more people are
supporting organizations
that are vital to our
democracy, like the more
than $86 million donated to the A.C.L.U.
in 2017, up from
the $5 million
they received in online
donations in 2016.
Planned Parenthood
donations skyrocketed,
reaching 40 times their
normal rate in the week
after the election.
Even local politics
hold our attention
and make national news.
It’s the new norm to
track court rulings
and be informed.
People are actually reading
and paying for news.
So here’s the deal.
The Democrats appear
to be more fired up
about the midterms than
Republicans, according
to this Pew Research study.
But we all know what
happens when eggs are
counted before they hatch.
“The largest audience to
ever witness an inauguration,
period."
So don’t go back to sleep.
Don’t let this deluge
of news and chaos turn
into white noise.
Stay in the game.
And definitely, please,
vote in the midterms
this November.
