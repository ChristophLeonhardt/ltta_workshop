1
00:00:13,896 --> 00:00:15,463
DO YOU WANT TO GET BACK IN TV?

2
00:00:15,464 --> 00:00:17,265
>> ONLY IF THERE IS NUDITY.

3
00:00:17,266 --> 00:00:17,999
>> Sean: [LAUGHING].

4
00:00:20,503 --> 00:00:22,537
>> YEAH, SO FAR THEY REFUSE!

5
00:00:22,538 --> 00:00:23,538
>> Sean: I DON'T KNOW IF YOU CAN

6
00:00:23,539 --> 00:00:26,408
GET THAT ON A NETWORK SHOW

7
00:00:26,409 --> 00:00:27,542
ANYWAY ON.

8
00:00:29,378 --> 00:00:31,780
>> I LIKE TALKING TO PEOPLE AND

9
00:00:31,781 --> 00:00:34,749
DISCUSSING, WHAT Y'ALL THINK OF

10
00:00:34,750 --> 00:00:35,216
THIS?

11
00:00:39,322 --> 00:00:39,688
>> YEAH.

12
00:00:39,689 --> 00:00:41,122
>> Sean: OBVIOUSLY, YOU CARE A

13
00:00:49,565 --> 00:00:52,801
>> Sean: WHAT CHANGED YOU?

14
00:00:52,802 --> 00:00:53,702
WHAT BOOKS?

15
00:00:53,703 --> 00:00:57,672
WHAT SHIFTED YOUR POLITICAL

16
00:00:57,673 --> 00:00:58,273
VIEWS?

17
00:00:58,274 --> 00:01:01,109
>> WELL, MY EXPERIENCE IN THE

18
00:01:01,110 --> 00:01:03,144
GREEN PARTY AND SOCIALIST PARTY

19
00:01:03,145 --> 00:01:12,754
I FELT VERY MARGINALIZED THERE

20
00:01:12,755 --> 00:01:15,457
BECAUSE THEY DON'T LIKE ISRAEL.

21
00:01:15,458 --> 00:01:17,792
WHAT THIS IS THE WORST PLACE ON

22
00:01:17,793 --> 00:01:18,593
EARTH.

23
00:01:18,594 --> 00:01:19,294
HAVE YOU BEEN THERE?

24
00:01:19,295 --> 00:01:21,997
>> Sean: I AM THE BIGGEST

25
00:01:25,401 --> 00:01:27,702
>> IT'S A WONDERFUL PLACE WITH

26
00:01:27,703 --> 00:01:29,971
PROBLEMS LIKE EVERY PLACE ELSE.

27
00:01:29,972 --> 00:01:32,674
I DO A LOT OF DRINKING -- MEAN

28
00:01:32,675 --> 00:01:34,209
THINKING AND I HAVE THE SOLUTION

29
00:01:34,210 --> 00:01:34,943
FOR IT.

30
00:01:34,944 --> 00:01:38,580
I HAVE ALWAYS SAID THIS FOR LIKE

31
00:01:38,581 --> 00:01:43,752
20 YEARS.

32
00:01:43,753 --> 00:01:45,854
JEWISH GRANDMOTHERS AND EVERYONE

33
00:01:45,855 --> 00:01:49,457
WHO LIVES OVER THERE, IF WE

34
00:01:49,458 --> 00:01:51,326
COULD WRITE UP A GRANDMA'S

35
00:01:51,327 --> 00:01:52,594
TREATY AND PRESENT IT TO THE

36
00:01:52,595 --> 00:01:56,131
POWER THAT WOULD BE THE FIFTY

37
00:01:56,132 --> 00:01:58,533
FASTEST WAY TO SOLVE PROBLEMS.

38
00:01:58,534 --> 00:02:01,670
THERE IS NO CHILD ON THE EARTH

39
00:02:17,253 --> 00:02:24,726
>> Sean: THERE IS A LOT OF EVIL

40
00:02:24,727 --> 00:02:24,993
TOO.

41
00:02:24,994 --> 00:02:26,394
>> PEOPLE SAY GET RID OF YOUR

42
00:02:26,395 --> 00:02:26,695
HATE.

43
00:02:26,696 --> 00:02:28,630
YOU ARE SUPPOSED TO HATE EVIL.

44
00:02:28,631 --> 00:02:29,964
>> Sean: I HAVE AN IDEA.

45
00:02:29,965 --> 00:02:33,301
AS I LISTEN TO YOU, YOU ARE VERY

46
00:02:33,302 --> 00:02:34,502
SINCERE IN SAYING I WANT TO HAVE

47
00:02:34,503 --> 00:02:35,236
A CONVERSATION.

48
00:02:35,237 --> 00:02:36,971
I THINK THE COUNTRY HAS NEVER

49
00:02:36,972 --> 00:02:38,373
BEEN THIS DIVIDED.

50
00:02:38,374 --> 00:02:39,808
>> IT'S STUPID!

51
00:02:39,809 --> 00:02:41,810
WE HAVE TO GET OUR MONEY BACK

52
00:02:41,811 --> 00:02:42,911
FROM BOTH SIDES.

53
00:02:42,912 --> 00:02:47,115
WE HAVE TO TALK TO EACH OTHER.

54
00:02:51,187 --> 00:02:53,621
STAND UP AND INVITE A GUEST AND

55
00:02:53,622 --> 00:02:56,858
HAVE A REAL CONVERSATION.

56
00:02:56,859 --> 00:03:01,563
THAT WOULD SELLOUT IN THEATERS

57
00:03:01,564 --> 00:03:02,864
ACROSS THE COUNTRY AND INVITE

58
00:03:04,100 --> 00:03:05,300
>> I WOULD DO.

59
00:03:05,301 --> 00:03:08,369
THAT WE SHOULD TURN THIS INTO

60
00:03:08,370 --> 00:03:10,205
A GREAT TEACHABLE MOMENT.

61
00:03:10,206 --> 00:03:12,507
THAT'S WHY YOU HAVE

62
00:03:12,508 --> 00:03:14,209
CONVERSATIONS SO YOU CAN

63
00:03:14,210 --> 00:03:14,976
SYNTHESIZE YOUR IDEAS AND COME

64
00:03:14,977 --> 00:03:17,612
UP WITH A SOLUTION.

65
00:03:23,319 --> 00:03:25,220
BECAUSE HE IS A SOLUTION GUY.

66
00:03:25,221 --> 00:03:27,422
>> Sean: THE COUNTRY HAS GOTTEN

67
00:03:33,129 --> 00:03:35,396
GAVE EVERY AMERICAN $30 MILLION

68
00:03:35,397 --> 00:03:38,133
THEY WOULD STILL HATE HIM.

69
00:03:38,134 --> 00:03:40,401
>> I THINK THEY ARE COMING

70
00:03:40,402 --> 00:03:40,735
AROUND.

71
00:03:40,736 --> 00:03:43,338
HIS STUFF IS COMING UP.

72
00:03:43,339 --> 00:03:43,905
HIS APPROVAL.

73
00:03:43,906 --> 00:03:45,406
>> Sean: I HAVEN'T ASKED YOU

74
00:03:45,407 --> 00:03:48,143
ABOUT TOM ARNOLD.

75
00:03:48,144 --> 00:03:49,410
DO YOU STILL LOVE HIM?

76
00:03:49,411 --> 00:03:53,715
>> DO I STILL LOVE HIM?

77
00:03:53,716 --> 00:03:55,717
>> Sean: APPARENTLY NOT.

78
00:03:55,718 --> 00:03:56,751
DID HE CALL YOU?

79
00:03:56,752 --> 00:03:57,185
>> HELL NO.

80
00:03:57,186 --> 00:04:00,955
THAT WAS 25 YEARS AGO!

81
00:04:00,956 --> 00:04:02,457
THAT WAS TWO HUSBANDS AGO.

82
00:04:02,458 --> 00:04:03,591
>> Sean: HOW MANY TOTAL?

83
00:04:03,592 --> 00:04:04,325
I AM NOT KEEPING UP.

84
00:04:09,598 --> 00:04:10,498
16 YEARS.

85
00:04:10,499 --> 00:04:13,802
I DON'T KNOW WHY HE STILL LIKES

86
00:04:13,803 --> 00:04:14,636
ME BUT HE DOES.

87
00:04:14,637 --> 00:04:20,108
>> Sean: HE CALLS YOU SMOKING.

88
00:04:20,108 --> 00:04:23,778
>> BECAUSE I WEAR A RUBBER GLOVE

89
00:04:23,779 --> 00:04:27,882
AND HAT IN THE ALLEY.

90
00:04:27,883 --> 00:04:29,551
HE DIDN'T KNOW AND I LIED.

91
00:04:29,552 --> 00:04:34,989
ON TOP OF ALL OF THIS OTHER

92
00:04:34,990 --> 00:04:38,326
STUFF, HE OPENS UP YAHOO AND

93
00:04:42,932 --> 00:04:44,966
HE SAID -- BECAUSE HE KNEW I

94
00:04:44,967 --> 00:04:47,936
WOULD KILL HIM IN ME MADE ME

95
00:04:47,937 --> 00:04:48,636
MAD.

96
00:04:48,637 --> 00:04:51,206
SWEETHEART, YOU LIED TO ME ABOUT

97
00:04:51,207 --> 00:04:52,507
SMOKING, DIDN'T YOU?

98
00:04:52,508 --> 00:04:55,610
>> Sean: WHAT DID YOU SAY?

99
00:04:55,611 --> 00:04:58,913
>> GET OUT.

100
00:04:58,914 --> 00:05:02,550
>> Sean: IN MY ALL MY CAREERS ON

101
00:05:02,551 --> 00:05:03,585
TELEVISION, THERE HAVE BEEN

102
00:05:03,586 --> 00:05:05,587
CONTROVERSIES AND SAMANTHA STILL

103
00:05:05,588 --> 00:05:07,255
HAS HER SHOW.

104
00:05:07,256 --> 00:05:09,290
BILL MAR GOT FIRED AT ABC.

105
00:05:09,291 --> 00:05:12,126
I SAID I AM NOT IN FAVOR OF

106
00:05:12,127 --> 00:05:13,394
BOYCOTTS.

107
00:05:13,395 --> 00:05:15,263
I THINK PEOPLE WHEN THEY MAKE

108
00:05:15,264 --> 00:05:16,931
MISTAKES -- I THINK THE AMERICAN

109
00:05:16,932 --> 00:05:18,166
PEOPLE ARE FAIR.

110
00:05:21,337 --> 00:05:22,170
GOOD.

111
00:05:22,171 --> 00:05:25,273
FORGET THE MEDIA.

112
00:05:25,274 --> 00:05:27,609
>> 28 MILLION TUNED INTO MY SHOW

113
00:05:27,610 --> 00:05:28,910
BECAUSE THEY WANTED TO SEE

114
00:05:36,151 --> 00:05:36,851
DONALD TRUMP.

115
00:05:36,852 --> 00:05:37,986
THAT'S NOT GOING TO HELP

116
00:05:37,987 --> 00:05:38,419
NOTHING.

117
00:05:38,420 --> 00:05:40,421
PEOPLE WANT TO HEAR THE BALANCE

118
00:05:40,422 --> 00:05:41,155
AND THE TRUTH.

119
00:05:41,156 --> 00:05:43,391
ANYTHING NOT BASED ON FACTS AND

120
00:05:43,392 --> 00:05:46,527
DATA AND PURE EMOTIONS, THAT

121
00:05:46,528 --> 00:05:47,595
AIN'T RIGHT.

122
00:05:47,596 --> 00:05:49,964
>> Sean: MAYBE YOU COULD DO

123
00:05:49,965 --> 00:05:52,200
STAND UP WITH THIS A PART OF IT.

124
00:05:52,201 --> 00:05:54,235
YOU STAND UP AND THEN SIT DOWN

125
00:05:54,236 --> 00:05:58,606
AND HAVE A CONVERSATION WITH

126
00:05:58,607 --> 00:06:01,109
SOMEONE YOU DISAGREE WITH.

127
00:06:05,481 --> 00:06:08,883
>> Sean: I WON'T KICK YOU OUT.

128
00:06:18,661 --> 00:06:22,430
WHEN I WAS 13 AND THEY WERE

129
00:06:22,431 --> 00:06:22,730
GOOD.

130
00:06:22,731 --> 00:06:25,934
>> Sean: YOU SMOKED THEM AFTER

131
00:06:25,935 --> 00:06:29,404
ALL OF THESE YEARS LATER?

132
00:06:29,405 --> 00:06:31,339
>> YES, AND I THANK YOU FOR THE

133
00:06:31,340 --> 00:06:31,739
FRIENDSHIP.

134
00:06:31,740 --> 00:00:00,000
YOU HELPED ME A LOT AND SO DID A
