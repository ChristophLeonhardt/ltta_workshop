THIS IS PROBABLY ALSO SOMETHING THAT FRUSTRATES OBSERVERS AND

281
00:09:14,026 --> 00:09:14,359
THAT FRUSTRATES OBSERVERS AND DEMOCRATS.

282
00:09:14,393 --> 00:09:16,261

00:09:16,262 --> 00:09:16,928
YOU LOOK AT TWO THINGS THAT HE’S DONE.

284
00:09:16,962 --> 00:09:19,464
DONE. ONE, A MASSIVE TAX CUT FOR

285
00:09:19,498 --> 00:09:22,300
ONE, A MASSIVE TAX CUT FOR LARGER CORPORATIONS HAS HELPED

286

NOW HE’S PRETENDING HE’S GOING TO HAVE A MIDDLE CLASS TAX CUT.

289
00:09:27,740 --> 00:09:29,941
TO HAVE A MIDDLE CLASS TAX CUT. THE SECOND THING HE DID WAS HE

290
00:09:29,942 --> 00:09:32,043
THE SECOND THING HE DID WAS HE TRIED TO GET RID OF SOME OF THE

291
00:09:32,044 --> 00:09:32,844
TRIED TO GET RID OF SOME OF THE PROTECTIONS IN THE AFFORDABLE

EVEN THOUGH YOU’RE MAKING A VERY GOOD POINT ON POLICY, ALTHOUGH

312
00:10:04,811 --> 00:10:06,678
GOOD POINT ON POLICY, ALTHOUGH THE "WALL STREET JOURNAL" DID

TIME IN 15 YEARS. STILL, A LOT MORE COULD BE DONE

318
00:10:14,921 --> 00:10:18,590
STILL, A LOT MORE COULD BE DONE FOR THESE PEOPLE.

319
00:10:18,591 --> 00:10:20,725
FOR THESE PEOPLE. THEY’RE VOTING FOR A WRECKING

THEY’RE VOTING FOR A WRECKING BALL.

321
00:10:21,094 --> 00:10:22,828
BALL. THEY WANT A WRECKING BALL TO

00:10:22,829 --> 00:10:24,530
THEY WANT A WRECKING BALL TO COME INTO THE SYSTEM AND SMASH

323
00:10:24,531 --> 00:10:26,699
COME INTO THE SYSTEM AND SMASH THESE PEOPLE MORE THAN ANY

00:10:26,700 --> 00:10:29,435
THESE PEOPLE MORE THAN ANY SPECIFIC POLICY OR IDEA.

325
00:10:29,469 --> 00:10:32,037
SPECIFIC POLICY OR IDEA. IF YOU’RE ON THE OTHER SIDE YOU
