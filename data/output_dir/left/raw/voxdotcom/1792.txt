00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:04,100
[Honking car horn, clock ticking, radio signal]

2
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:06,100
You hear that?

3
00:00:06,660 --> 00:00:08,700
That's the sound of
silence.

4
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:10,560
Well, not really.

5
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:16,820
Absolute silence doesn't really exist in
our world, but there's an entire field of

6
00:00:16,820 --> 00:00:19,660
study devoted to the science of silence.

7
00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:21,020
Why?

8
00:00:21,020 --> 00:00:23,340
Well, it plays a huge part in our

9
00:00:23,340 --> 00:00:24,400
daily well-being.

10
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:31,760
Our brains are
hard-wired to perceive sounds even when

11
00:00:31,769 --> 00:00:32,879
they're not there.

12
00:00:32,879 --> 00:00:36,270
Moviegoers have felt
this for generations but, thanks to

13
00:00:36,270 --> 00:00:39,480
modern technologies, scientists know this
to be fact.

14
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:40,829
A recent study by the

15
00:00:40,829 --> 00:00:44,910
University of Southern California
demonstrated how silent films could

16
00:00:44,910 --> 00:00:49,760
elicit content-specific reactions in
your brain's auditory cortices.

17
00:00:50,220 --> 00:00:51,260
In other words,

18
00:00:51,260 --> 00:00:54,740
as you watch these images your
brain is pulling from memories and past

19
00:00:54,740 --> 00:00:56,820
experiences to fill in the blanks.

20
00:00:57,620 --> 00:00:59,280
This effect is sometimes referred to as

21
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:03,989
"hearing in your mind's ear" and it's the
reason why, when your favorite song cuts

22
00:01:03,989 --> 00:01:05,060
short on the radio,

23
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:09,480
You can still hear it.

24
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:12,600
So if we can never really experience

25
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:16,140
silence in nature, can we create it
artificially?

26
00:01:19,660 --> 00:01:22,900
At facilities like 3M's campus in St. Paul,
Minnesota,

27
00:01:22,900 --> 00:01:24,660
silence becomes science.

28
00:01:25,590 --> 00:01:28,340
We're in the anechoic chamber here in
the 3M Center.

29
00:01:28,340 --> 00:01:29,460
And this is a room that

30
00:01:29,460 --> 00:01:32,920
was built back in '64 and eats echoes.

31
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:35,380
Sound just hits the wall and dies.

32
00:01:35,500 --> 00:01:41,100
Anechoic or non-echoing chambers such as these
are used by scientists to study how

33
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:44,060
sound operates in a truly quiet
environment.

34
00:01:44,060 --> 00:01:45,030
When you're doing science

35
00:01:45,030 --> 00:01:49,289
you can control temperature, you can
control pressure, flow, and you never

36
00:01:49,289 --> 00:01:51,000
thought you could control sound.

37
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,980
But in this room we can do that.

38
00:01:52,980 --> 00:01:53,970
Why do scientists

39
00:01:53,970 --> 00:01:56,080
care about capturing quiet?

40
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:59,920
When something's quiet you think it's high quality,

41
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:03,560
you go into a hotel room and the
air conditioner, that makes a lot of

42
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:05,820
noise. What does that tell you? It's cheap.

43
00:02:05,820 --> 00:02:08,240
Quietness is a sign of quality.

44
00:02:09,220 --> 00:02:10,920
So, how does it all work?

45
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:15,000
The secret of silence is the chamber's design.

46
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,100
It's a building within a building.

47
00:02:17,100 --> 00:02:19,000
Every surface is covered in an

48
00:02:19,019 --> 00:02:22,400
intricately arranged series of
fiberglass wedges.

49
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:23,370
As sound waves

50
00:02:23,370 --> 00:02:27,299
propagate out from a source, they get
trapped between these wedges, bouncing

51
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:29,340
back and forth until they dissipate.

52
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:32,060
Even the floor and ceiling are covered,

53
00:02:32,060 --> 00:02:37,520
creating a completely spherical surround-sound setup of silent seclusion.

54
00:02:38,100 --> 00:02:39,380
What does it sound like?

55
00:02:39,380 --> 00:02:42,860
Well, while a balloon
popped in a reverberant room might sound

56
00:02:42,860 --> 00:02:43,700
like this:

57
00:02:45,380 --> 00:02:48,900
Inside 3M's anechoic
chamber, it sounds like this:

58
00:02:51,220 --> 00:02:51,960
It's gone.

59
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:57,940
So, how do the physics of this chamber
relate to our daily lives?

60
00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:02,200
By understanding how sound waves work 3M
researchers have been able to develop

61
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:07,000
technologies that absorb and reduce
noise in virtually every environment

62
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,060
that surrounds us.

63
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:12,040
Airplanes for instance,
use a specially designed foil tape to

64
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:14,540
dissipate vibration and noise in the
cabin.

65
00:03:14,540 --> 00:03:16,840
Even if it can't stop that crying baby.

66
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:22,260
Modern cars meanwhile, keep noise to
a low hum by using microfiber technology.

67
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:27,180
Without it, conversation in cars would be
a screaming match. And once driverless

68
00:03:27,180 --> 00:03:31,600
cars are widespread, there will be a lot
more time for talking and work on the road.

69
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:36,060
These quality of life improvements
can also have a direct impact on your

70
00:03:36,060 --> 00:03:36,980
mental health.

71
00:03:39,380 --> 00:03:42,360
A growing body of research
has shown how chronic levels of noise

72
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:45,980
can lead to sleep loss, heart disease, and
high blood pressure.

73
00:03:46,420 --> 00:03:46,980
On the flip side,

74
00:03:46,990 --> 00:03:51,310
quiet environment seem to have
directly positive benefits. Noise

75
00:03:51,310 --> 00:03:53,280
pollution is harmful to the human.

76
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:56,590
It wears you down, it makes you anxious, it

77
00:03:56,590 --> 00:03:57,700
makes you tired.

78
00:03:57,700 --> 00:03:59,920
There's only so much
noise you can take and then your brain

79
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:01,120
needs to relax.

80
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:04,200
These things always work,
even when you're asleep.

81
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:05,200
Removing excess

82
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:09,220
noise not only lowers our stress levels,
but even promotes the development of new

83
00:04:09,220 --> 00:04:10,320
brain cells.

84
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:11,920
Among mice, at least.

85
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:14,590
You can
reduce noise and have a much more

86
00:04:14,590 --> 00:04:15,760
pleasant life.

87
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:19,630
You know, you can have nice
conversations over the dinner table when a

88
00:04:19,630 --> 00:04:22,940
jet's flying over, if you can control the
unwanted noise.

89
00:04:23,540 --> 00:04:24,140
Wherever you are, there's

90
00:04:24,140 --> 00:04:25,440
going to be noise.

91
00:04:26,300 --> 00:00:00,000
We live in a noisy world.
