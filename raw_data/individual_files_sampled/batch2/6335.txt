all right well the rebel headquarters got a great show for you guys today first set of guests are two folks who are doing independent media so near and dear to our hearts so they are Daniel of Kerr and Kitka Baio they're from Chicago they do hard Lesbia what I'm the show guys how you doing hey good to see you it's been a while it has yeah that's right so I I of course went to Chicago because Chicago won the tyt contest the city contest that we did and met a lot of the folks there and you all have a really interesting story so I'm gonna take this one step at a time I'll talk about your company a little bit that I want to go back and talk about you know your background and how you came to know TOI T etcetera but first one of you guys jump and I guess Daniel you're the CEO so why don't you tell us what hard lens media is well harlem's media was created actually a lot of the influences from wolfpack in our experience there with the idea of bringing up the voices of individuals groups and organizations that media wouldn't talk to didn't care about and so someone had to speak for those people and pluck for those stories and that involvement it's now we now have a radio show we the television show and we have an upcoming radio show coming on our new network WCG oh it's really been a wild ride this last year but it's a real shame that actually what we've been doing has been so successful but there's really nothing else in Chicago meeting this kind of demand talking to people and in a said in a selfish way it's terrific for us but it's no one else was here to answer the call so we decided we had to do it yeah that really does sound like TYT in a lot of ways you know nobody else was doing progressive talk nobody else was against the Iraq war so we thought we'd step in and give it a shot so I love that so KITT give us a sense of how your experience on Wolf Pack helped inform this well when I first joined Wolf Pack I remember your conversation about you know getting money out of politics it was in fact I joined Wolf Pack in February 2014 and before I signed up remember you speaking to the audience saying look we have to get money out of politics we have to get our democracy back and if we don't get involved then don't be that person who says that they wish they could have helped and when I joined up in in 2014 we had a very solid team together I was so strong that we managed to get it passed in the Illinois State Senate and then come by I believe nearing the end of knowing it was the February 2013 and then bye-bye 2014 I'm also I was messed up on that so by nearing the time of December of 2014 we managed to get it passed in the Illinois State House and this was the first successful wind and Wolf Pack had in a very long time and it was enough so to where we were able to make a real impact in Illinois state politics and a lot of people said that it couldn't be could not be done because Illinois has a long sad history of really nothing getting done yeah you know before I get back into how you guys are covering Chicago and in terms of independent media I can't I want to stay on that for a second so your murine you were in Iraq I'm curious I may be this is a weird question or a weird way of approaching the issue but how would you compare the your military experience with the Wolfpack experience well those are two different things I mean you gotta live the Marine Corps it is what it is it's it's you're being trained to go overseas you're serving in the military and at the same time you know you're really working with a unit a team to get a mission and objectives done granted Wolfpack's mission and objective to get things done is a little bit different it's to get money out of politics but it's a little bit more here's here's a costs have really invest into because what the whole thing was Iraq war I mean we all know what happened in the first place and that was basically you know weapons of mass destruction but there were none to be found whereas was Wolfpack's mission objective it was hey we got to get our democracy back and if we don't do it well we're gonna be run by oligarchs and which one you prefer to live an oligarchy or you want to somehow stop that oligarchy yeah yeah no I'd love that you guys got involved and I love that you passed it's so great record of success already Illinois is one of the five states that has called for a convention he have money out of politics so Daniel what are the three outlets that you guys are on now and how did you get on them well we started as just a Facebook page even before we got in those outlets and that's Harlan's media on Facebook same on YouTube but you know we realize that it's all about growing and how many people you can reach and that will in itself grow and evolve in its own way so then about almost a year ago we got onto a few q4q ue4 org and there are a community organization in a radio channel and a lot of ways what we do on there getting on there in the first place wouldn't have worked if they weren't what they were - and they're also community driven organization and then about four or five months ago we got onto ken TV which is actually just like what you've had was a public access TV we've been on there for a while and we sit down with guests on both of both shows for the Kin TV we sit down and we talk kit talks I do the camera work for about 30 minutes and just talk about the issues it's very issue driven that's all our shows are a few driven the radio show we have two individuals that we come up that come on the radio show and they vary but usually it's politics related to almost always politics related and again it goes to bringing people on that are not heard anywhere else the new show that's coming up is a much larger network intellectually um triple our reach in terms of how many people we talk to in Chicago and that's going to be very similar to how we operate the queue for show just what happens much time so look I love your can-do attitude maybe that's why you're on can TV know but seriously not only have you guys gotten these huge figures in Chicago and Illinois like Daniel Biss JB Pritzker Chuy Garcia it's but you've gotten a lot of national figures Jimmy Doorly camp Jane Sanders Nina Turner Josh Fox and the list goes on those are some pretty great gets how'd you guys do that well it's kind of goes back to the same thing we just go where media doesn't exist and usually there were interesting people there and a lot of people we met at the people's summit last year which was a lot of fun but you know in a lot of ways it just there's people that people go around very famous people go around the country and there aren't news organizations covering it and it just comes down to it yeah it is kind of amazing how little press especially progressives get and that's part of why we started rebel headquarters and that's part of why we're interviewing you guys because we don't want to do just candidates we want to get the whole progressive ecosystem to get larger and larger by getting everybody exposure so now let's talk about how you do cover Chicago so kit you know I know Chicago is a bit of an amazing city especially when it comes to politics but yeah what's going on lately what are the topics that you guys often come back to oh that's a great question and it's it's something I hope that your audience gets to hear about as well because just because Chicago is a major metropolitan city or has the title being a democratic city or a quote-unquote liberal City that's not the case at all in fact the real truth is that all across Chicago especially in a lot of low-income minority communities there's gentrification of taking place and what this means in the long term is that people of color working-class families people working two or three jobs are being displaced because of these large real estate developers that are moving in and these large real estate developers have connections with people in Cook County city government state government to some extent as well as the mayoral office and as a result you're seeing thousands of people getting displaced you're seeing these new buildings going being built schools being shut down and people are angry they don't have a place to live and a lot of people do living in these communities like South Austin Pilsen Englewood for example not even living there for generations and now they're being kicked out and the any government or alderman Derr elected officials are turning a blind eye and a deaf ear that are pleased and concern so when we go there we talk to these groups these individuals like Pilsen Alliance groups in South Austin 2055 PL 12 IPO and there's a lot of issues that aren't also being addressed as well such as recently there's lead in our water Chicago's drinking water isn't safe and 70 percent of the places have been tested actually came positive for lead and we've known about this for a while we've gone we were working with these Chicago when that was happening and in a lot of ways we kind of joke about it off when we're not on there but in many ways Chicago is the most futile city in the nation right in that it's like four or five people that really control how everything works here and it's very in front in a way that's very similar to Washington it's also important to note that Chicago isn't just segregated it's hyper segregated you've got the north and south side and usually the north side is labeled as the more affluent part of Chicago's South Side it's for low income but even within the north side and south side there are various different neighborhoods and the weight of entire city and Cook County is gerrymandered really people don't have a voice unless you're connected and by connected you need to be connected to some of the ruling families and dynasties that have been in power in Illinois and Chicago for a very long time and also just adding on to the water issue Chicago is obviously near Lake Michigan but if you cross the border into the state of Indiana you got these large steel mill factories that are pouring you know regulated mining regulated toxic waste into the water and Daniel Daniel's about as a lead contractor and he's also worked for some of these other dangerous chemicals in the past as well and you can tell you what exactly is being dumped the largest body of fresh water well part of the issue with it goes to what you say when they say regulated with quotations yeah regulated with quotations is hey you can't put that toxic material into the water you got to add water to it first then you can put it in the water then it's safe so you have right next to Chicago where we get our water and other places get their water you have the largest or is it the largest steel blast furnace in the Western hemisphere tire refinery back to the largest tar sands refinery and ill in the US you had a jet fuel production and that goes to East IMF which is the place we've covered in the past where all these interest rates around people and so less how you met the region when we were doing my work there I had a had an area that was just built on top of a lead refinery or the corpse of a leather finery so yeah the area should have EPA standards if it's 200 parts per million in the soil or less it's considered fine natural if it's over 400 parts it's considered BPF to go in and replace all the soil they were front yards kids were playing in that had 90 thousand parts per million and again it went back to Illinois have this areas of the city that are just contaminated with what again led something that I would work with it's incredibly dangerous substance to have in your body especially young and just to add on to what daniel said to as I mentioned earlier these large real estate developers are moving into these low-income communities so these same low-income communities have a lot of lead in their water and the great scam that the real estate developers do this to this whole plan is gentrification what they do is uh it once they kick out all the people that shouldn't be in the neighborhood anymore then they go in they rebuild it they put in new pipes new everything and then sell to people who I guess the city wants to live here yeah one thing that goes into the variance is it's a very strategic way to replace mature because a lot of people we've talked to mean only for the most probably to go out and ask people and this is it's very public it's just if they're being a certain geographic area for it to be public is that you know they've been asking for yours hey can you fix our pipes hey can you put a bank here hey can you put a grocery store here hey can you do this you can do that and the answer is always well no we don't have the money for it then as soon as they're out oh we're going to put all this stuff and that you were asking for for a generation or so yeah not the new people are here and if we were lying the clocks back just a little bit there was an infamous city hall debate in which our elected officials managed to have the money to build a 95 million dollar police academy and when chance of rapper asked mayor Emanuel hey how can we have money for this Academy but not enough money for our public schools Manuel heroically walked out of the room mmm yeah that's that sounds like Rahm Emanuel I know all right guys I love how passionate you are about the issues and about Chicago and you know I wish TYT had the resources to set up outlets in all the different cities but not yet so in the meanwhile I love that you picked up the flag and started running with it and so I just give everybody that doesn't necessarily live in Chicago a sense of how they can catch hard lens media okay so the best way that we'd like go is we have a Facebook page that's what we're most active on we have a YouTube page that has a lot of this stuff on our Facebook page we usually use it for more our kind but we're planning in the future to have an actual show they're kind of like kind of PYT does and see a look at us also at Heartland mediacom and a big call-out I want to give is if there are any people on to my T's network that are listening right now that are in Chicago we are in dire need of journalists and people to help us cover this so I'm interested to us right now we have two other people that are able to work a little bit every other couple weeks and where does that capacity we need more people help what we do is I wish the two of us could cover the entire city but it's a lot of people and there's something else too I'd like to end real quick there was a just a quick story just to show you just how much kind of impact we're making a lot of people here in Illinois a while back in Oak Park there was a vote to raise the minimum wage to $15 and it was a point to where it wouldn't get passed and there were a lot of people there and one of our colleagues who we've interviewed in the past was excited to see us and she asked us hey where's the other media where's NBC CBS where it were these guys that don't you talk to them don't you have their numbers can you call them over here and and I said her look we don't have their numbers we don't really know them that well but we are here and see she paused for a moment said we reached out to them too and they didn't respond back and then she said I'm so glad you guys are here yeah something has to be Mia standing a post all right Daniel of Kerr kid Kibeho hard lens media ready hard lens Mediacom thank you so much for joining us and and being passionate about these issues in covering your city love it or happy to be here we hope to work with the T might see more in the future or we progressively has to say oh yeah there isn't that much of us all right I love it sounds good
