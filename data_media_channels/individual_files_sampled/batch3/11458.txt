our site and all of a sudden Frank the blue on the left side of the defense I got the ball and we had it always in our mind if I'm if the ball was on the left side as a striker you come on the same side of the ball and we knew that if I'm going to that side space will come special come on the left side of the of the defense of Argentina and Bergkamp and and and frank de boer then they linked with each other not only and that match but a lot of matches and all of a sudden that ball came and I saw the ball leaving it was I think 50 yards long ball the touch the first touch was amazing because he I don't know if it was the first such that he snapped it on his left foot but he managed to control the ball unbelievably well and I think one of the second touch he he came inside and the outside of his right foot when when that ball left of his foot I was like wow and it's bang just right in the net and I was like what did happens what did happened now and all of a sudden yeah an explosion of course because if you win 2-1 against against Argentina the feeling is amazing you can see the replay everybody went with crazy dreaming playing hard work one day the true the drink and true when I counted the nineteen a tide just work hard to be on world cup when I'm scored first goal your dream coming and you know but what is more important when I score six goals my team is confident egos teammates love and village Bob and personage chiisana which Aaron see give the ball up for up front he will score it took me like I would say three four years so maybe at the end of my career that I realized I became worker players you know when I'm in France every day every day there is somebody say oh thank you very much for the work up for the last 20 years so it takes the time you had when the whistle goes you know when the ref says the end of the game you just lose the pressure and for preserving belly I'm from Italy and I support a seroma because I'm from roma Roma city growing up in Rome you're have artists everywhere in thinkers everywhere so maybe that have have moved me in some way but most of all is football because Roma everything talks about football everywhere and maybe the two one one two of my great passions art and football and I try to mix it together in this work is one of my favorites if you see it it's not dressed exactly like the others there are more generous and everything but it's the king of Manchester so I try to put it some Macbeth dress or something like this I don't know nothing about a uniform of each count you know I just think that some fits better than others and and then I try to add everything possible to represent the region as nations they're commiserations four last time eight honestly cheers boys 15:1 no

relative tera astronaut Cristina CO - si Abuelita is damaged enemy attack see just stand up aqui para la stanza bitch like Oleg thank you so much boswer a beautiful exhibition park and a lovely sunny day in Moscow a couple of days before the FIFA World Cup final we're nearly there now let's have a little look back first at the semi-finals France against Belgium France worthy winners I think they were a lot of people spoke about France maybe being a little bit defensive but I think they played to their strengths I thought they got a spot on budget Belgium had a very good tournament as well but right at the moment in time when they really needed to put a performance in I thought that a little bit short and I thought of France will deserve a finalist England against Croatia England started the game very well as in the stadium behind the goal with all of the crew took the lead with a fantastic free kick from Kieran Trippier but Croatia came strong tell us what this means for the nation of Croatia tell us what it means in context of the 1998 team and tell us what it means to Croatian for all to get into a World Cup final well absolutely amazing that's all I can say unbelievable fight that they showed we spoke to some people from Croatia this morning who basically compared it service the country's only been in existence for 27 years who compared it to basically winning independence and and that was during a bloody war so just to show the significance of that victory last night 1998 was absolutely fantastic as well Ivan village all of them but they got to the final this time and against the country that is a massive footballing nation in England and again I think part of the allure of that was the fact that no one expected it but you're right England had the chance to finish off Croatia in that first hour or so but then after that moderate racket its pros of each Paris it's rebek Mandzukic all of them basically took over and great equalizer and then a fabulous winner by Mandzukic as well so the whole nation these is basically in a state of pleasant shock but they know there's one more big one to come fantastic let's have a look at the final France against Croatia who's winning it well I think number one they both deserve a finalist I think they are the two best teams at a World Cup and that's rare there you get I think the two best teams in a World Cup final one mine just straight away just back in 1982 with that Brazilian side you never got to the final I think it's going to be a very very close encounter obviously coming from Croatian background with my heart I want Croatia to win but I think France will prevail in the end when we're looking at France Didier Deschamps elf Warner World Cup and was famously the water carrier that Eric Cantona talked about the one of the mercurial geniuses of French football is this a pragmatic French side rather than one full of flesh should they be playing with a little bit more dry de vivre well perhaps so from the neutral perspective you say yes but if you look at it if I step into my I say French shoes I would say no and let's not forget 1998 as well they had one of the greatest players of all time in zinedine zidane and you write the has de sharm some people call him a water carry but other people called into general and they were quite pragmatic as much as they had some Flair in that side they were very pragmatic consider very few goals a lot like this French cider there Deschamps is now coaching now the way that they've played like I said I think that they've started off here and like true champions just growing up eventually just like that they've relied when they needed to on some great individual displays byamba pay specifically and also Griezmann and also paul pogba and i think that's where they shops as expertise has come in he knows what it's like to have a genius in your midfield and the type of players around him like Conte like maturity to allow POG where to do his stuff and he has done his stuff and so as the whole of France balls let's look back at some of the highlights of this FIFA World Cup there was some trepidation some fear but it's been absolutely sensational on and off the pitch let's look at the on pitch highlights what been some of your favorite moments and goals well in goals I've got to say the goalkeepers in my opinion overall have been outstanding obviously we had David to hers first mistake which was a basic mistake against Portugal but the rest of the goalkeeping I can't remember one like there for the rest of the competition short and pickford England payment services with an England group with my England hat on it's three relatively okay goalkeepers he's come out with a lot of critics well for me he's been one of the best goalkeepers here and I think the for goalkeepers in the semi-finals Courtois sue Basij Laurice and Pickford were the four best goalkeepers in the tournament the recent super stitch will be playing in the final but Jordan Pickford can hold his head very very high men in a match against Sweden was fantastic against crochet made that really top save against Mandzukic in the first period of extra time Courtois against Brazil I thought maybe one of the saves of the tournament the shot that was to his left that he pulled off and flicked it over the bar with an outstanding save contributed and went Laurice as well and one that's not being talked about so much outstanding save against Uruguay which could have been the equalizer they headed down and against Belgium let's not forget that shot that we returned and hit and he flicked it around the bar that shot goes in it's one nil to build him rather than being one nil to France after they score from the set play tell me about the stadia the atmospheres the fans some of my memories are 30,000 Brazilians Argentinians Mexicans Peruvians in the first few weeks of the tournament really adding to the color I'm sure you'd concur with that yeah 100% fantastic country fantastic people first and foremost the Russian people have been absolutely great food which is important to me as you know and and also there was a lock you said you mentioned the word trepidation there was a lot of people from all the countries but specifically Australia specifically England and I justified or not no it wasn't and you can speak to any supporter that's been here the the most regular comment that I've had from people that come up to speak to me from England in Australia and even cry yesterday was I can't believe what I thought before I come here and how great I've had a time when I've been here in Russia and let's hope that this World Cup as great as has been it really does finish off with a bang with a great game on Sunday let's hope that as well Basel it leads to me to say thank you very much thank you so joining me on the stand Collymore show to have your insight your fun you've brought a brand new energy to this team I know we'll work together again someday for now let's go another wonder into exhibition Park and a trip down memory lane or I go can I just say a special thank you to you because I've loved working with you
