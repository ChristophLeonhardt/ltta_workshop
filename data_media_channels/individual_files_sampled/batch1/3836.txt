so studio wrote this very provocative blog post the other day where you basically wrote back and said look when I was in Little League we didn't get an ice cream just for losing you actually had to win before you got some success and you say that when you look at it the business world lots and lots of people today are just simply congratulate or trying I think that's true I congratulate every entrepreneur for taking the risk and actually starting something because it takes such intestinal fortitude to leave a big company job and start something from scratch and go against all odds and create something but the truth of the matter is not all of those companies should be started and not all of those companies in fact a relatively small sub sector of those companies should be funded and particularly funded by venture capitalists and you've dealt with a lot of successful companies over the years you probably watched thousands more that have failed do you feel like the folks who ultimately are going to succeed have a sense of that that they shouldn't just simply be rewarded for the fortitude or that that's not all there is that they actually need to deliver after that well i think you know you can be psychically rewarded in that you're starting something and it's good for you but the truth of matter is in the end companies either work or they don't work and if they work you're making money you're adding value to society you're creating a either a product or a service which is you know helping people and that's adding real value if you if you have a product that doesn't work in a company that fails you're causing a lot of pain you're losing either your money you're losing your investors money you're wasting your time you're putting your family at risk so in on the one hand i'm a little bit torn because i'm impressed by every entrepreneur that becomes an entrepreneur and i love the fact that every entrepreneur puts their you know puts everything on the line to create something from nothing but i also know that if it turns out unsuccessfully it's a very bad thing so if certain people should not be entrepreneurs i guess in the end what I'm saying is certain people are entrepreneurs they have the spirit the ability the judgment they sort of what some people call the rat like cunning to create something out of nothing and get something done and others just shouldn't they get pushed into being an entrepreneur because either they they lost their job or they think it's cool i remember back in 1999 you had all these people leaving IBM and these very large companies to go work for startups and they were not start up people they come in and saying well I was running 225,000 dollars as you know an x-large company now I'd like you to pay me two hundred and twenty-five thousand dollars plus the equity and by the way I want there to be no risk and it just doesn't work that way it's all risk and reward you know when you take the risk and if it works out you get their greater reward but the risk also has a downside which is what the end of the first ball will really showed and I remember that just crystal clearly of people saying but now but how about that small companies how are they going to get funded again and so forth and you realize that the true entrepreneurs are going to power through that as they did in the bust but so when you look at somebody who is going to succeed or you're evaluating entrepreneurs some of them always sound incredibly grandiose making these great claims sometimes that's very successful others tend to be total realists but they have a hard time selling things I mean is there a consistent theme that you see and the type of entrepreneurs that you're talking about the people that actually should and do have what it takes to do this I would say it's what I look for in both entrepreneurs and in co-investors is what I like to say is no naive tagged right no not eat a also has something to do with judgment right so they're not naive about the business they're going to go into they're not naive about how much money it's going to take they're not naive about how hard it is to build they're not naive about you know where you're going to start it in and what it's actually going to take to get from you know absolute start up to large success and the risk inherent in that fundamentally usually people that have done it before have a lot less night a about doing it again and those are the ones that are really a pleasure to fund when you have to teach somebody and you know teaching on your dollar on your dime is very painful and it can be very very expensive as well and do you find that these entrepreneurs have the same sense of realism with you and with their employees or when they go back to the shop and they talk to the employees about whipping them up and the chances of success are they again as realistic in that environment as they are with you absolutely not you know to be a good entrepreneur you have to force it will things through right to create something from nothing you have to push through a wall and get something done and a few things are true in start-up companies they're huge risks that are being taken with customers and there's huge in effect with capital because you're always running very very lean you're running sort of to the edge when you fund a round of capital right that round is what's take you to the next valuation point and the closer you get to being out of money theoretically the greater evaluation you're creating and if you try and raise money to too far away from that valuation point then you're not going to have a step up or it may be a down round so you don't want to do that but if you get too close to it a lot of unsystematic things can cause the timing to get put off and the closer you get to being out of money the more risky it is for your company and you're not going to go back to your company and say you know what guys I decided I'm going to put all of your jobs at risk and wait an extra month until I start fundraising because I think i can get a slightly higher valuation you have to make judgment calls and you have to go back to your company if to be realistic you have to tell your company when things are working and when things aren't working but certain things don't need to be in their purview right the fact that you have high confidence that you are going to raise that amount of money and that you know that you'll be able to fund that company going forward you don't have to be so clear on the company and explain to them it specifically what you're doing with the cash and why you're the executive you're making the decisions you're in effect shepherding over these people it is your responsibility to make sure that they stay employed and create value and do the right things you don't need to needlessly worry about you don't need to make them needlessly worry about things that you're supposed to be handling
