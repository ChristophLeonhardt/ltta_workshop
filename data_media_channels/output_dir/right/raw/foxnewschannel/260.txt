1
00:00:07,578 --> 00:00:08,211
>> Greg: KANYE WENT TO THE

2
00:00:08,212 --> 00:00:08,611
WHITE HOUSE.

3
00:00:08,612 --> 00:00:09,345
I WONDER IF THEY TRY TO SCARE

4
00:00:09,346 --> 00:00:11,881
HIM INTO NOT WEARING HIS HAT.

5
00:00:11,882 --> 00:00:13,883
>> THEY TRIED TO SCARE MEET TO

6
00:00:13,884 --> 00:00:15,885
NOT WEAR THIS HAT, MY OWN

7
00:00:15,886 --> 00:00:16,486
FRIENDS.

8
00:00:16,487 --> 00:00:19,722
HIS HAT, IT GIVES ME POWER IN A

9
00:00:19,723 --> 00:00:20,290
WAY.

10
00:00:20,291 --> 00:00:22,292
I LOVE HILLARY.

11
00:00:22,293 --> 00:00:23,860
I LOVE EVERYONE.

12
00:00:23,861 --> 00:00:27,263
BUT THE CAMPAIGN "I'M WITH HER,"

13
00:00:27,264 --> 00:00:29,899
DIDN'T MAKE ME FEEL, AS A GUY,

14
00:00:29,900 --> 00:00:31,668
IT DIDN'T MAKE ME FEEL -- I

15
00:00:31,669 --> 00:00:34,671
DIDN'T SEE MY DAD IN.

16
00:00:34,672 --> 00:00:37,373
WHEN I PUT THIS HAT ON, IT MADE

17
00:00:37,374 --> 00:00:40,109
ME FEEL LIKE SUPERMAN.

18
00:00:40,110 --> 00:00:41,444
SUPERMAN IS MY FAVORITE

19
00:00:41,445 --> 00:00:42,078
SUPERHERO.

20
00:00:42,079 --> 00:00:44,080
>> Greg: WHEN THE PRESIDENT

21
00:00:44,081 --> 00:00:46,316
DOESN'T LOOK GOOD, AMERICA

22
00:00:46,317 --> 00:00:47,116
DOESN'T LOOK GOOD.

23
00:00:47,117 --> 00:00:50,086
>> IF HE DON'T LOOK GOOD, WE

24
00:00:50,087 --> 00:00:51,287
DON'T LOOK GOOD.

25
00:00:51,288 --> 00:00:53,089
THIS IS OUR PRESIDENT.

26
00:00:53,090 --> 00:00:56,893
HE HAS TO BE THE FRESHEST, FLY

27
00:00:56,894 --> 00:00:58,928
ASKED, BEST.

28
00:00:58,929 --> 00:01:00,463
WE HAVE TO MAKE OUR CORE

29
00:01:00,464 --> 00:01:00,897
RE-EMPOWER.

30
00:01:00,898 --> 00:01:02,732
WE HAVE TO BRING JOBS INTO

31
00:01:02,733 --> 00:01:03,733
AMERICA AND WE ARE PUTTING

32
00:01:03,734 --> 00:01:09,172
PEOPLE IN POSITION TO HAVE TO DO

33
00:01:09,173 --> 00:01:14,010
THINGS TO END UP IN THE PRISON

34
00:01:14,011 --> 00:01:14,911
SYSTEM.

35
00:01:14,912 --> 00:01:16,145
>> President Trump: THAT WAS

36
00:01:16,146 --> 00:01:17,280
PRETTY IMPRESSIVE.

37
00:01:17,281 --> 00:01:17,647
[LAUGHTER]

38
00:01:17,648 --> 00:01:20,983
>> Greg: ALL WE REALLY HAVE IS

39
00:01:20,984 --> 00:01:21,317
TODAY.

40
00:01:21,318 --> 00:01:23,419
>> ALL WE REALLY HAVE IS TODAY.

41
00:01:23,420 --> 00:01:26,122
WE JUST HAVE TODAY.

42
00:01:26,123 --> 00:01:27,123
OVER AND OVER AGAIN.

43
00:01:27,124 --> 00:01:30,326
THE HERO'S JOURNEY.

44
00:01:30,327 --> 00:01:32,595
TRUMP IS ON HIS HERO'S JOURNEY

45
00:01:32,596 --> 00:01:33,863
RIGHT AND HE MIGHT HAVE EXPECTED

46
00:01:33,864 --> 00:01:41,871
TO HAVE A CRAZY [BLEEP] LIKE

47
00:01:41,872 --> 00:01:43,306
KANYE WEST, HAVE SUPPORT.

48
00:01:43,307 --> 00:01:45,942
BEST BELIEVE WE OUGHT TO MAKE

49
00:01:45,943 --> 00:01:46,876
AMERICA GREAT.

50
00:01:46,877 --> 00:01:48,010
>> Greg: JUST ANOTHER DAY IN

51
00:01:48,011 --> 00:01:48,911
TRUMP WORLD.

52
00:01:48,912 --> 00:01:51,514
THIS IS A NEW FRONTIER FULL OF

53
00:01:51,515 --> 00:01:52,415
INCREDIBLE ALLIES AND SURREAL

54
00:01:52,416 --> 00:01:52,782
SURPRISES.

55
00:01:52,783 --> 00:01:55,151
AFTER BEING TOLD IT WAS GOING TO

56
00:01:55,152 --> 00:01:57,487
BE THE APOCALYPSE, WE HAVE A

57
00:01:57,488 --> 00:01:58,955
BOOMING ECONOMY AND RIDICULOUSLY

58
00:01:58,956 --> 00:02:00,957
LOW UNEMPLOYMENT, NEW JUSTICE,

59
00:02:00,958 --> 00:02:03,426
NO UGLY WARS, PROGRESS, TRADE,

60
00:02:03,427 --> 00:02:05,728
PEACE IN KOREA AND YOU HAVE THE

61
00:02:05,729 --> 00:02:07,330
WORLD'S BIGGEST MALE POP STAR

62
00:02:07,331 --> 00:02:08,197
GOING TO THE WHITE HOUSE TO

63
00:02:08,198 --> 00:02:10,199
DISCUSS BIG ISSUES AND GETTING

64
00:02:10,199 --> 00:02:13,736
WHAT SEEMS TO BE A REAL

65
00:02:13,737 --> 00:02:14,470
CONCESSION.

66
00:02:14,471 --> 00:02:17,507
HE WOULD THINK HE WOULD RECEIVE

67
00:02:17,508 --> 00:02:18,207
MEDIA ACCLAIM FOR TRYING.

68
00:02:18,208 --> 00:02:21,611
YOU WOULD BE WRONG.

69
00:02:21,612 --> 00:02:22,578
>> THAT WAS BONKERS.

70
00:02:22,579 --> 00:02:25,047
>> IF YOU THINK YOU'RE GOING TO

71
00:02:25,048 --> 00:02:26,516
GET A THOUGHTFUL PLAY-BY-PLAY

72
00:02:26,517 --> 00:02:27,550
AND POLITICAL ANALYSIS, YOU'RE

73
00:02:27,551 --> 00:02:28,317
NOT.

74
00:02:28,318 --> 00:02:29,552
THAT WAS AN ASSAULT ON OUR

75
00:02:29,553 --> 00:02:29,952
WHITE HOUSE.

76
00:02:29,953 --> 00:02:32,121
>> THAT WAS CRAZY.

77
00:02:32,122 --> 00:02:33,256
THAT WAS BONKERS.

78
00:02:33,257 --> 00:02:34,323
>> Greg: SUCH RIDICULE BY

79
00:02:34,324 --> 00:02:35,558
THOSE WHO WOULD NEVER THINK OF

80
00:02:35,559 --> 00:02:36,325
TAKING SUCH RISKS.

81
00:02:36,326 --> 00:02:39,495
THEY CALLED IT BONKERS AND

82
00:02:39,496 --> 00:02:39,796
CRAZY.

83
00:02:39,797 --> 00:02:42,131
DOG WHISTLES MEANT TO BRING UP

84
00:02:42,132 --> 00:02:43,499
CONNIE'S MENTAL STATE.

85
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:44,901
SORRY, IF YOU USE MENTAL ILLNESS

86
00:02:44,902 --> 00:02:46,102
IS A DISQUALIFYING FACTOR TO

87
00:02:46,103 --> 00:02:47,904
EXPRESS AN OPINION, YOU WOULD

88
00:02:47,905 --> 00:02:51,140
HAVE NO GUESTS ON YOUR NETWORK.

89
00:02:51,141 --> 00:02:53,309
AFTER TODAY, EXPECT A PILE ON.

90
00:02:53,310 --> 00:02:54,811
"SNL" WILL DO A SKIT THAT WILL

91
00:02:54,812 --> 00:02:56,012
BE MUCH LESS ENTERTAINING THAN

92
00:02:56,013 --> 00:02:58,080
THE REAL THING AND THE MEAN

93
00:02:58,081 --> 00:03:00,082
GIRLS AT CNN WILL CALL HIM

94
00:03:00,083 --> 00:03:03,953
NAMES, LIKE THEY DID LAST NIGHT.

95
00:03:03,954 --> 00:03:07,323
>> HE IS AN ATTENTION WHORE LIKE

96
00:03:07,324 --> 00:03:09,258

HE'S THE MODEL SPOKESMAN.

HE'S THE TOKEN >> Greg: OF THE

99
00:03:13,797 --> 00:03:14,363
TRUMP ADMINISTRATION.

100
00:03:14,364 --> 00:03:16,332
>> Greg: WHEN YOU ARE ON TV

101
00:03:16,333 --> 00:03:18,201
GIVING A HOT TAKE, HOLD OFF ON

102
00:03:18,202 --> 00:03:20,369
THE ACCUSATIONS OF ATTENTION

103
00:03:20,370 --> 00:03:23,773
SEEKING.

104
00:03:23,774 --> 00:03:29,278
WEST CAN HANDLE IT.

105
00:03:29,279 --> 00:03:33,316
THE WITH THE RISK HE IS TAKING L

106
00:03:33,317 --> 00:03:33,349

GROUPTHINK OF THE ENTERTAINMENT

110
00:03:36,420 --> 00:03:38,254
WORLD, ESPECIALLY WHEN HE DOES

111
00:03:38,255 --> 00:03:39,922
THIS.

112
00:03:39,923 --> 00:03:42,792
>> I LOVE THIS GUY.

113
00:03:42,793 --> 00:03:46,329
LET ME GIVE THIS GUY A HUG.

114
00:03:46,330 --> 00:03:49,699
I LOVE THIS GUY RIGHT HERE.

115
00:03:49,700 --> 00:03:50,700
>> President Trump: THAT'S

116
00:03:50,701 --> 00:03:52,502
REALLY NICE.

117
00:03:52,503 --> 00:03:55,104
JIM, KANYE, I APPRECIATE IT.

118
00:03:55,105 --> 00:03:56,939
LET'S GO HAVE SOME LUNCH.

119
00:03:56,940 --> 00:03:58,608
>> Greg: JESSE, WE WERE

120
00:03:58,609 --> 00:03:59,141
TALKING ABOUT.

121
00:03:59,142 --> 00:04:04,113
THERE IS SOMETHING ACTUALLY VERY

122
00:04:04,114 --> 00:04:05,948
POWERFUL -- I FOUND IT TO BE

123
00:04:05,949 --> 00:04:07,183
VERY POWERFUL.

124
00:04:07,184 --> 00:04:07,750
I DON'T KNOW.

125
00:04:07,751 --> 00:04:09,519
>> Jesse: WAS A VERY SPECIAL

126
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:10,119
MOMENT.

127
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:11,487
THINK ABOUT THE RAW TALENT IN

128
00:04:11,488 --> 00:04:11,988
THAT ROOM.

129
00:04:11,989 --> 00:04:13,923
JIM BROWN, ONE OF THE GREATEST

130
00:04:13,924 --> 00:04:16,692
RUNNING BACKS EVER, KANYE WEST,

131
00:04:16,692 --> 00:04:17,659
ONE OF THE MOST TALENTED ARTISTS

132
00:04:17,661 --> 00:04:19,529
OF ALL TIME.

133
00:04:19,529 --> 00:04:21,496
AND DONALD TRUMP, TALENTED

134
00:04:21,498 --> 00:04:22,164
POLITICIAN AND BUSINESSMAN.

135
00:04:22,165 --> 00:04:24,033
SITTING TOGETHER AND IT WAS A

136
00:04:24,034 --> 00:04:24,934
SPECIAL MOMENT.

137
00:04:24,935 --> 00:04:26,235
HE PLAYED A REALLY IMPORTANT

138
00:04:26,236 --> 00:04:28,304
SOUND BITE.

139
00:04:28,305 --> 00:04:30,339
KANYE SAID BECAUSE CHINA HAS

140
00:04:30,340 --> 00:04:31,707
STOLEN ALL OF OUR FACTORY JOBS

141
00:04:31,708 --> 00:04:33,009
FROM THE INNER CITIES AND FROM

142
00:04:33,010 --> 00:04:34,810
THE CORE OF AMERICA, IT'S GOTTEN

143
00:04:34,811 --> 00:04:36,946
TO THE POINT WHERE YOUNG BLACK

144
00:04:36,947 --> 00:04:39,048
AMERICANS ARE NOW TAKING RISKS

145
00:04:39,049 --> 00:04:40,349
AND DOING ILLEGAL THINGS TO FEED

146
00:04:40,350 --> 00:04:41,551
THEIR FAMILY BECAUSE THEY DON'T

147
00:04:41,552 --> 00:04:43,719
HAVE ACCESS TO GOOD JOBS ANYMORE

148
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:59,235
AND THEY ARE GETTING PUT IN

149
00:04:59,236 --> 00:04:59,535
JAIL.

150
00:04:59,536 --> 00:05:00,236
IF YOU CAN SOLVE THAT PROBLEM

151
00:05:00,237 --> 00:05:00,970
AND IF YOU CAN GET BLACK AMERICA

152
00:05:00,971 --> 00:05:01,637
BUY INTO THE "AMERICA FIRST"

153
00:05:01,638 --> 00:05:02,338
AGENDA, MADE IN AMERICA, TRADE

154
00:05:02,339 --> 00:05:03,072
AGENDA, THE ENERGY AGENDA, IT'S

155
00:05:03,073 --> 00:05:03,773
GOING TO HAVE A HUGE IMPACT ON

156
00:05:03,774 --> 00:05:04,440
THIS COUNTRY WHERE YOU HAVE

157
00:05:04,441 --> 00:05:06,008
PEOPLE COMING TOGETHER OF ALL

158
00:05:06,009 --> 00:05:08,010
STRIPES AND FIGHTING FOR A

159
00:05:08,011 --> 00:05:10,479
NATIONALISTIC, PATRIOTIC

160
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:13,082
ECONOMIC AGENDA FOR THE COUNTRY.

161
00:05:13,083 --> 00:05:14,951
THE MEDIA IS ALREADY FRAMING IT

162
00:05:14,952 --> 00:05:17,687
AS NEGATIVE, SAYING THAT IT WAS

163
00:05:17,688 --> 00:05:18,588
AN ANGRY RANT.

164
00:05:18,589 --> 00:05:19,822
WHEN TAYLOR SWIFT WHEN

165
00:05:19,823 --> 00:05:21,524
TAYLOR SWIFT KATY PERRY, THEY DO

166
00:05:21,525 --> 00:05:23,960
THOSE THINGS, THEY'RE CALLED

167
00:05:23,961 --> 00:05:25,895
EXPRESSIONS, SOULFUL

168
00:05:25,896 --> 00:05:26,896
EXPRESSIONS, PASSIONATE.

169
00:05:26,897 --> 00:05:28,197
YOU DON'T HEAR THAT.

170
00:05:28,198 --> 00:05:29,198
YOU HAVE TO KEEP IN MIND THAT

171
00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:30,433
THE MEDIA IS TRYING TO TRICK

172
00:05:30,434 --> 00:05:31,133
YOUR MIND AND I THOUGHT

173
00:05:31,134 --> 00:05:35,104
EVERYBODY NEEDS TO WATCH THE RAW

174
00:05:35,105 --> 00:05:35,438
FOOTAGE.

175
00:05:35,439 --> 00:05:37,707
IT WAS MORE THAN YOU PLAYED.

176
00:05:37,708 --> 00:05:38,708
IT WAS EYE-OPENING.

177
00:05:38,709 --> 00:05:40,509
>> Greg: JUAN, THERE WAS A

178
00:05:40,510 --> 00:05:42,745
MOMENT WHEN I THINK YOU WOULD

179
00:05:42,746 --> 00:05:44,747
HAVE ADMIRED WITCHES HE WENT IN

180
00:05:44,748 --> 00:05:46,415
THERE AND HE COMPLEMENTED

181
00:05:46,416 --> 00:05:49,485
DONALD TRUMP AND THEN HE SLIPPED

182
00:05:49,486 --> 00:05:49,518
DONALD TRUMP AND THEN HE SLIPPEI

183
00:05:49,519 --> 00:05:49,552

190
00:05:50,621 --> 00:05:50,653
DONALD TRUMP AND THEN HE SLIPPEL

191
00:05:50,654 --> 00:05:50,720
DONALD TRUMP AND THEN HE SLIPPEE

192
00:05:50,721 --> 00:05:50,886
DONALD TRUMP AND THEN HE SLIPPES

193
00:05:50,887 --> 00:05:50,920
DONALD TRUMP AND THEN HE SLIPPEW

194
00:05:50,921 --> 00:05:51,220
DONALD TRUMP AND THEN HE SLIPPES

195
00:05:51,221 --> 00:05:55,291
IMPORTANT, THAT THEY HAD TO STOP

196
00:05:55,292 --> 00:05:57,226
STOP AND FRISK IN CHICAGO

197
00:05:57,227 --> 00:05:58,127
BECAUSE IT'S DESTRUCTIVE.

198
00:05:58,128 --> 00:06:00,396
THE LOOK ON TRUMP'S FACE WAS

199
00:06:00,397 --> 00:06:13,409
LIKE, OKAY.

200
00:06:13,410 --> 00:06:13,876
YOU CAN LAUGH.

201
00:06:13,877 --> 00:06:14,644
YOU CAN LOVE HIM OR HATE HIM BUT

202
00:06:14,645 --> 00:06:15,344
I BELIEVE HE GOT A CONFESSION

203
00:06:15,345 --> 00:06:15,778
OUT OF TRUMP.

204
00:06:15,779 --> 00:06:16,445
>> Juan: I WAS GOING TO ASK,

205
00:06:16,446 --> 00:06:16,912
WHAT CONCESSION?

206
00:06:16,913 --> 00:06:17,613
DO YOU THINK TRUMP IS GOING TO

207
00:06:17,614 --> 00:06:18,614
BACK OFF OF STOP AND FRISK?

208
00:06:18,615 --> 00:06:20,149
>> Greg: TRUMP HAS GOTTEN SO

209
00:06:20,150 --> 00:06:21,317
MUCH OUT OF THIS.

210
00:06:21,318 --> 00:06:22,084
I THINK THERE'S A GENUINE

211
00:06:22,085 --> 00:06:23,319
AFFECTION BETWEEN THESE TWO MEN

212
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:25,121
THAT HE WILL PROBABLY GET

213
00:06:25,122 --> 00:06:26,756
SOMETHING OUT OF IT, IN EXCHANGE

214
00:06:26,757 --> 00:06:27,289
FOR SOMETHING ELSE.

215
00:06:27,290 --> 00:06:28,624
>> Juan: I DIDN'T SEE ANY

216
00:06:28,625 --> 00:06:30,359
MAJOR CONCESSION ON THE TABLE

217
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:32,728
BECAUSE I DIDN'T SEE SUBSTANCE.

218
00:06:32,729 --> 00:06:34,563
INSTEAD, I SEE A CELEBRITY.

219
00:06:34,564 --> 00:06:36,332
I DON'T UNDERSTAND -- I THINK

220
00:06:36,333 --> 00:06:37,767
THE OVAL OFFICE SHOULD BE

221
00:06:37,768 --> 00:06:39,001
TREATED WITH SOME RESPECT AND

222
00:06:39,002 --> 00:06:40,736
THE IDEA THAT HE GOES IN THERE

223
00:06:40,737 --> 00:06:42,571
AND HE'S USING SUCH AWFUL

224
00:06:42,572 --> 00:06:44,940
LANGUAGE, I DON'T THINK THAT'S

225
00:06:44,941 --> 00:06:45,574
VERY COOL.

226
00:06:45,575 --> 00:06:47,443
>> Jesse: WAS BILL CLINTON

227
00:06:47,444 --> 00:06:49,945
RESPECTFUL OF THE OFFICE?

228
00:06:49,946 --> 00:06:51,547
>> Juan: HERE'S THE THING

229
00:06:51,548 --> 00:06:52,048
ABOUT THIS GUY.

230
00:06:52,049 --> 00:06:56,318
I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY IT IS

231
00:06:56,319 --> 00:06:58,320
THAT, YOU KNOW, PEOPLE WOULD

232
00:06:58,321 --> 00:06:59,922
THINK THIS IS ABOUT THE BLACK

233
00:06:59,923 --> 00:07:00,923
COMMUNITY.

234
00:07:00,924 --> 00:07:01,557
TO THE CONTRARY.

235
00:07:01,558 --> 00:07:03,492
THIS IS TRUMP I THINK SPEAKING

236
00:07:03,493 --> 00:07:05,261
TO HIS WHITE BACKERS AND SAYING

237
00:07:05,262 --> 00:07:07,029
I'M NOT A RACIST.

238
00:07:07,030 --> 00:07:08,130
>> Jedidiah: COME ON.

239
00:07:08,131 --> 00:07:08,964
>> Juan: KANYE WEST IS HERE

240
00:07:08,965 --> 00:07:13,302
WITH ME SO --

241
00:07:13,303 --> 00:07:15,304
ALL THESE THINGS ABOUT ME

242
00:07:15,305 --> 00:07:16,639
CALLING PEOPLE DOGS AND COMING

243
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:20,409
FROM S-HOLE COUNTRIES, DON'T

244
00:07:20,410 --> 00:07:26,115
WORRY ABOUT IT.

245
00:07:26,116 --> 00:07:28,384
>> Greg: IF A WHITE PERSON IS

246
00:07:28,385 --> 00:07:29,452
HAVING A CONVERSATION WITH A

247
00:07:29,453 --> 00:07:35,725
BLACK LEADER, YOUR ANSWER IS

248
00:07:35,726 --> 00:07:36,025
TO --

249
00:07:36,026 --> 00:07:37,226
>> Juan: THIS BEHAVIOR BY

250
00:07:37,227 --> 00:07:38,894
TRUMP DIDN'T START YESTERDAY.

251
00:07:38,895 --> 00:07:41,764
HE HAD BLACK PEOPLE COMING IN,

252
00:07:41,765 --> 00:07:45,134
LIKE JIM BROWN, STEVE HARVEY.

253
00:07:45,135 --> 00:07:45,868
AND KANYE WEST.

254
00:07:45,869 --> 00:07:49,105
AT TRUMP TOWER.

255
00:07:49,106 --> 00:07:50,706
WHAT CAME OUT OF IT?

256
00:07:50,707 --> 00:07:51,006
ZERO.

257
00:07:51,007 --> 00:07:54,310
THIS IS THE POINT.

258
00:07:54,311 --> 00:07:56,145
>> Greg: IT'S CALLED PROGRESS.

259
00:07:56,146 --> 00:07:57,513
>> Juan: PROGRESS IN TERMS OF

260
00:07:57,514 --> 00:07:59,315
TRUMP SAYING FORGET ALL THE

261
00:07:59,316 --> 00:08:01,117
THINGS I'VE DONE.

262
00:08:01,118 --> 00:08:02,918
I HAVE A BLACK FRIEND,

263
00:08:02,919 --> 00:08:03,319
KANYE WEST.

264
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:04,954
>> Jedidiah: IF KANYE WANTED

265
00:08:04,955 --> 00:08:05,988
TO GO TO THE WHITE HOUSE AND

266
00:08:05,989 --> 00:08:08,257
TALKED TO TRUMP, HE WOULD BE

267
00:08:08,258 --> 00:08:10,126
LABELED RACIST.

268
00:08:10,127 --> 00:08:11,327
IF KANYE WANTS TO GO TO THE

269
00:08:11,328 --> 00:08:13,562
WHITE HOUSE AND TALK TO TRUMP,

270
00:08:13,563 --> 00:08:14,663
HE'S LABELED RACIST.

271
00:08:14,664 --> 00:08:16,098
YOU HAVE TO GIVE KANYE CREDIT.

272
00:08:16,099 --> 00:08:17,900
I DON'T ALWAYS AGREE WITH HIM

273
00:08:17,901 --> 00:08:18,501
THEN SOMETIMES I DON'T

274
00:08:18,502 --> 00:08:19,502
UNDERSTAND WHAT HE'S SAYING BUT

275
00:08:19,503 --> 00:08:23,706
HE GOES IN AND SPEAKS HIS MIND

276
00:08:23,707 --> 00:08:25,541
AND KANYE WEST KNOWS HE'S GOING

277
00:08:25,542 --> 00:08:26,542
TO BE ABUSED BY EVERYBODY IN

278
00:08:26,543 --> 00:08:27,710
HOLLYWOOD AND EVERYONE IN HIS

279
00:08:27,711 --> 00:08:29,545
BUBBLE, THEY'RE GOING TO MAKE

280
00:08:29,546 --> 00:08:31,747
FUN OF HIM AND BERATE HIM AND HE

281
00:08:31,748 --> 00:08:33,482
DOESN'T CARE AND FRANKLY THAT IS

282
00:08:33,482 --> 00:08:34,149
INSPIRATIONAL.

283
00:08:34,150 --> 00:08:35,083
WE SHOULD BE TELLING EVERYBODY

284
00:08:35,085 --> 00:08:37,820
IF YOU HAVE SOMETHING TO SAY,

285
00:08:37,821 --> 00:08:38,554
YOU WANT TO TALK TO THE

286
00:08:38,554 --> 00:08:39,521
PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES

287
00:08:39,523 --> 00:08:41,624
AND HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY, EVEN

288
00:08:41,625 --> 00:08:42,958
IF YOU DON'T AGREE AND YOU CAN

289
00:08:42,958 --> 00:08:45,361
PUT POLICY ON THE TABLE, STOP

290
00:08:45,362 --> 00:08:47,363
AND FRISK OR WHATEVER.

291
00:08:47,364 --> 00:08:48,831
WE ARE TALKING ABOUT STOP AND

292
00:08:48,832 --> 00:08:49,131
FRISK.

293
00:08:49,132 --> 00:08:54,937
IT'S AN ACCOMPLISHED --

294
00:08:54,938 --> 00:08:55,404
ACCOMPLISHMENT.

295
00:08:55,405 --> 00:08:56,305
>> Juan: WHEN YOU HAVE THIS

296
00:08:56,306 --> 00:08:58,507
GUY SAYING LET'S DO AWAY WITH

297
00:08:58,508 --> 00:08:59,241
THE 13TH AMENDMENT WHICH ENDED

298
00:08:59,242 --> 00:09:01,210
SLAVERY IN THIS COUNTRY, YOU

299
00:09:01,211 --> 00:09:05,581
THINK I THINK SOMETHING IS

300
00:09:05,582 --> 00:09:06,315
WRONG.

301
00:09:06,316 --> 00:09:07,016
>> Greg: THERE WERE SEVEN

302
00:09:07,017 --> 00:09:08,751
SUBSTANCE ON THAT.

303
00:09:08,752 --> 00:09:11,687
IS HE SOMEONE SOMEONE WILLING TO

304
00:09:11,688 --> 00:09:12,688
SACRIFICE HIS COOL CREDENTIALS B

305
00:09:12,689 --> 00:09:12,721
SACRIFICE HIS COOL CREDENTIALS C

306
00:09:12,722 --> 00:09:12,755
SACRIFICE HIS COOL CREDENTIALS U

307
00:09:12,756 --> 00:09:12,988
SACRIFICE HIS COOL CREDENTIALS E

308
00:09:12,989 --> 00:09:15,558
HE BELIEVES IN IT.

309
00:09:15,559 --> 00:09:17,493
IN THE MESSAGE IS NOT A SINGLE

310
00:09:17,494 --> 00:09:18,761
NEGATIVE MESSAGE.

311
00:09:18,762 --> 00:09:20,129
>> Dana: WHEN YOU ARE IN A

312
00:09:20,130 --> 00:09:21,931
POSITION WHERE YOU HAVE THE

313
00:09:21,932 --> 00:09:22,565
FREEDOMS AND THE FINANCIAL

314
00:09:22,566 --> 00:09:24,099
SECURITY TO BE ABLE TO TAKE A

315
00:09:24,100 --> 00:09:25,968
RISK AND DO WHAT YOU WANT, YOU

316
00:09:25,969 --> 00:09:27,703
CAN BE A LEADER IN A DIFFERENT

317
00:09:27,704 --> 00:09:28,137
WAY.

318
00:09:28,138 --> 00:09:30,139
I ALSO THINK EVERYONE NEEDS TO

319
00:09:30,140 --> 00:09:31,140
SLEEP ON IT.

320
00:09:31,141 --> 00:09:32,408
WAKE UP IN THE MORNING AND

321
00:09:32,409 --> 00:09:33,876
LISTEN TO OTHER PEOPLE.

322
00:09:33,877 --> 00:09:35,077
JUAN FEELS PASSIONATELY AND I'M

323
00:09:35,078 --> 00:09:35,845
SURE A LOT OF PEOPLE AROUND THE

324
00:09:35,846 --> 00:09:36,645
COUNTRY DO.

325
00:09:36,646 --> 00:09:40,916
THEN GO BACK -- YESTERDAY

326
00:09:40,917 --> 00:09:42,518
PRESIDENT TRUMP WAS AT THE

327
00:09:42,519 --> 00:09:43,219
INTERNATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF

328
00:09:43,220 --> 00:09:46,121
CHIEFS OF POLICE IN FLORIDA.

329
00:09:46,122 --> 00:09:47,523
HE LOVES THE POLICE.

330
00:09:47,524 --> 00:09:49,325
HE SUPPORTS THE POLICE.

331
00:09:49,326 --> 00:09:50,993
HE SAYS THE ONLY ADMINISTRATION

332
00:09:50,994 --> 00:09:52,528
THAT'S BEHIND YOU, THAT

333
00:09:52,529 --> 00:09:53,529
HYPERBOLE BUT PART OF IT IS

334
00:09:53,530 --> 00:09:54,997
TRUSTING THE POLICE TO DO

335
00:09:54,998 --> 00:09:55,364
SOMETHING.

336
00:09:55,365 --> 00:09:56,665
KANYE WEST SAYS I DON'T LIKE

337
00:09:56,666 --> 00:09:59,568
STOP AND FRISK.

338
00:09:59,569 --> 00:10:00,736
MAYBE THE PRESIDENT BECAUSE HE

339
00:10:00,737 --> 00:10:02,905
HAS THE POWER OF CONVENING,

340
00:10:02,906 --> 00:10:03,505
BRING PEOPLE TOGETHER.

341
00:10:03,506 --> 00:10:05,307
WHAT'S IMPORTANT IS TO BE ABLE

342
00:10:05,308 --> 00:10:07,142
TO HAVE TWO SIDES TALK.

343
00:10:07,143 --> 00:10:08,644
STOP AND FRISK ISN'T GOING TO

344
00:10:08,645 --> 00:10:10,045
STOP BECAUSE POLICE THINK IT'S

345
00:10:10,046 --> 00:10:10,412
EFFECTIVE.

346
00:10:10,413 --> 00:10:11,747
UNLESS THERE'S A SITUATION WHERE

347
00:10:11,748 --> 00:10:12,915
YOU GO TO COURT.

348
00:10:12,916 --> 00:10:14,450
>> Greg: I MENTION THREE WEEKS

349
00:10:14,451 --> 00:10:16,118
AGO THAT COLIN KAEPERNICK SHOULD

350
00:10:16,119 --> 00:10:17,186
GO TO THE WHITE HOUSE AND MEET

351
00:10:17,187 --> 00:10:19,021
WITH TRUMP, AND THAT WAS THE

352
00:10:19,022 --> 00:10:20,956
OTHER THING THE KANYE WEST SAID.

353
00:10:20,957 --> 00:10:23,559
HIS GOAL IS TO BRING KAEPERNICK

354
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:26,962
AND TRUMP TOGETHER, CONVENING.

355
00:10:26,963 --> 00:10:31,367
>> Dana: THIS WHITE HOUSE IS

356
00:10:31,368 --> 00:10:32,902
VERY TELEVISION SAVVY.

357
00:10:32,903 --> 00:10:34,803
SOMETIMES THEY SET UP SHOTS THEY

358
00:10:34,804 --> 00:10:36,705
DO NOT WORK FOR THEM.

359
00:10:36,706 --> 00:10:37,940
THIS ONE IS INTERESTING.

360
00:10:37,941 --> 00:10:39,008
PRESIDENT TRUMP IS BEHIND THE

361
00:10:39,009 --> 00:10:39,375
DESK.

362
00:10:39,376 --> 00:10:40,643
USUALLY WHEN HE HAS A MEETING

363
00:10:40,644 --> 00:10:42,144
WITH SOMEBODY IN THE

364
00:10:42,145 --> 00:10:44,346
OVAL OFFICE, HE IS WITH A WORLD

365
00:10:44,347 --> 00:10:45,514
LEADER OR SOMEONE, NIKKI HALEY,

366
00:10:45,515 --> 00:10:47,249
THEY WERE IN THE CHAIRS.

367
00:10:47,250 --> 00:10:48,550
THE PRESIDENT KNEW.

368
00:10:48,551 --> 00:10:49,985
HE DIDN'T ELEVATE KANYE WEST TO

369
00:10:49,986 --> 00:10:50,953
THAT LEVEL.

370
00:10:50,954 --> 00:10:51,887
I'M GOING TO SIT BEHIND THE DESK

371
00:10:51,888 --> 00:10:53,856
AND WERE GOING TO HAVE A MEETING

372
00:10:53,857 --> 00:10:55,391
AT THE SHOP, THE WAY IT'S SET

373
00:10:55,392 --> 00:10:57,226
UP, THE ONLY PEOPLE IN THE SHOT,

374
00:10:57,227 --> 00:10:59,395
YOU CAN SEE PRESIDENT TRUMP A

375
00:10:59,396 --> 00:10:59,795
LITTLE BIT.

376
00:10:59,796 --> 00:11:00,996
THE PROFILE OF KANYE WEST AND

377
00:11:00,997 --> 00:11:01,797
ALL OF THE MEDIA.

378
00:11:01,798 --> 00:11:03,666
IT WAS INTERESTING TO WATCH WITH

379
00:11:03,667 --> 00:11:05,367
THE SOUND OFF, AS I DID, WHEN I

380
00:11:05,368 --> 00:11:09,705
WAS GETTING HAIR AND MAKEUP DON

381
00:11:09,706 --> 00:11:10,005
DONE.

382
00:11:10,006 --> 00:11:11,140
I THOUGHT IT'S THE CRAZIEST

383
00:11:11,141 --> 00:11:12,508
THING I'VE EVER SEEN, NOT IN A

384
00:11:12,509 --> 00:11:12,841
BAD WAY.

385
00:11:12,842 --> 00:11:14,743
IT WAS DIFFERENT.

386
00:11:14,744 --> 00:11:17,313
WE ARE IN A TIME OF

387
00:11:17,314 --> 00:11:18,314
EXTRAORDINARY ECONOMIC

388
00:11:18,315 --> 00:11:18,714
PROSPERITY.

389
00:11:18,715 --> 00:11:19,548
YOU CAN SOLVE PROBLEMS LIKE THE

390
00:11:19,549 --> 00:11:21,517
ONES THEY ARE TALKING ABOUT.

391
00:11:21,518 --> 00:11:23,485
YOU CONVENE PEOPLE TO BE ABLE TO

392
00:11:23,486 --> 00:11:24,119
TALK ABOUT IT.

393
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:25,521
WE ARE NOT AT EACH OTHER'S

394
00:11:25,522 --> 00:11:28,090
THROATS FOR CERTAIN THINGS.

395
00:11:28,091 --> 00:11:29,491
WHEN YOU HAVE PEACE AND

396
00:11:29,492 --> 00:11:31,293
PROSPERITY, YOU CAN DEAL WITH

397
00:11:31,294 --> 00:11:31,727
THESE THINGS.

398
00:11:31,728 --> 00:11:33,429
>> Greg: MIGHT I QUOTE SCOTT

399
00:11:33,430 --> 00:11:34,096
ADAMS?

400
00:11:34,097 --> 00:00:00,000
HE SAID WE DON'T HAVE A MONEY
