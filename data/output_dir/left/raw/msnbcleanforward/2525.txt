EVERY DAY THERE ARE STORIES THAT DONALD TRUMP DOESN’T WANT US TO

00:00:16,516 --> 00:00:18,408
DONALD TRUMP DOESN’T WANT US TO TALK ABOUT, AND HE IS LUCKY

9
00:00:18,451 --> 00:00:19,643
TALK ABOUT, AND HE IS LUCKY BECAUSE WE OFTEN DON’T GET TO

10
00:00:19,686 --> 00:00:21,211
BECAUSE WE OFTEN DON’T GET TO MANY OF THE STORIES, LIKE FOR

11
00:00:21,221 --> 00:00:22,712
MANY OF THE STORIES, LIKE FOR EXAMPLE, THE RAMPANT CORRUPTION

12
00:00:22,756 --> 00:00:25,181
EXAMPLE, THE RAMPANT CORRUPTION IN HIS CABINET FROM SCOTT PRUITT

13
00:00:25,225 --> 00:00:25,916
IN HIS CABINET FROM SCOTT PRUITT TO WILBUR ROSS.

14
00:00:25,926 --> 00:00:27,617
TO WILBUR ROSS. BUT TONIGHT THERE IS ONE STORY

15
00:00:27,628 --> 00:00:30,420
BUT TONIGHT THERE IS ONE STORY ABOVE ALL OTHERS THAT IS BY FAR

16
00:00:30,463 --> 00:00:32,289
ABOVE ALL OTHERS THAT IS BY FAR THE MOST IMPORTANT STORY THAT

17
00:00:32,332 --> 00:00:33,223
THE MOST IMPORTANT STORY THAT DONALD TRUMP DOESN’T WANT US TO

18
00:00:33,233 --> 00:00:39,496
DONALD TRUMP DOESN’T WANT US TO TALK ABOUT, THE BIGGEST STORY.

19
00:00:39,506 --> 00:00:40,497
TALK ABOUT, THE BIGGEST STORY. REMEMBER THE $19 TRILLION?

20
00:00:40,507 --> 00:00:43,033
REMEMBER THE $19 TRILLION? >> WE HAVE $19 TRILLION IN DEBT

21
00:00:43,076 --> 00:00:45,135
>> WE HAVE $19 TRILLION IN DEBT GOING VERY SOON TO $21 TRILLION

22
00:00:45,145 --> 00:00:46,970
GOING VERY SOON TO $21 TRILLION BECAUSE WE MADE A BAD BUDGET

23
00:00:47,014 --> 00:00:47,304
BECAUSE WE MADE A BAD BUDGET DEAL.

24
00:00:47,314 --> 00:00:49,139
DEAL. NOW WE’RE GOING TO HAVE $21

25
00:00:49,183 --> 00:00:50,107
NOW WE’RE GOING TO HAVE $21 TRILLION IN DEBT.

26
00:00:50,150 --> 00:00:51,341
TRILLION IN DEBT. WELL DON’T HAVE ANY MONEY.

27
00:00:51,351 --> 00:00:53,944
WELL DON’T HAVE ANY MONEY. >> WE HAVE GOT A MESS IN THIS

28
00:00:53,987 --> 00:00:54,478
>> WE HAVE GOT A MESS IN THIS COUNTRY.

29
00:00:54,521 --> 00:00:57,514
COUNTRY. WE OWE $19 TRILLION, SOON TO BE

30
00:00:57,524 --> 00:00:58,048
WE OWE $19 TRILLION, SOON TO BE $21 TRILLION.

31
00:00:58,091 --> 00:01:01,151
$21 TRILLION. >> WE HAVE RIGHT NOW $19

32
00:01:01,161 --> 00:01:06,023
>> WE HAVE RIGHT NOW $19 TRILLION IN DEBT.

33
00:01:06,066 --> 00:01:08,158
TRILLION IN DEBT. SO I BUILT SOME OF THE GREAT

34
00:01:08,168 --> 00:01:09,760
SO I BUILT SOME OF THE GREAT ASSETS, LOW DEBT, GREAT CASH

35
00:01:09,803 --> 00:01:11,295
ASSETS, LOW DEBT, GREAT CASH FLOW, AND I SAY IT FOR A

36
00:01:11,338 --> 00:01:13,063
FLOW, AND I SAY IT FOR A DIFFERENT REASON, BECAUSE THAT’S

37
00:01:13,073 --> 00:01:15,966
DIFFERENT REASON, BECAUSE THAT’S THE KIND OF THINKING WE NEED IN

38
00:01:16,009 --> 00:01:17,167
THE KIND OF THINKING WE NEED IN OUR COUNTRY NOW OR WE’RE NOT

39
00:01:17,177 --> 00:01:18,402
OUR COUNTRY NOW OR WE’RE NOT GOING HAVE A COUNTRY LEFT.

40
00:01:18,445 --> 00:01:20,737
GOING HAVE A COUNTRY LEFT. WE’RE NOT GOING TO HAVE

41
00:01:20,748 --> 00:01:21,438
WE’RE NOT GOING TO HAVE LITERALLY, WE’RE NOT GOING TO

42
00:01:21,449 --> 00:01:24,174
LITERALLY, WE’RE NOT GOING TO HAVE A COUNTRY LEFT.

43
00:01:24,184 --> 00:01:25,842
HAVE A COUNTRY LEFT. >> I THOUGHT WE WEREN’T GOING TO

44
00:01:25,853 --> 00:01:27,678
>> I THOUGHT WE WEREN’T GOING TO HAVE A COUNTRY LEFT IF WE DIDN’T

45
00:01:27,688 --> 00:01:29,146
HAVE A COUNTRY LEFT IF WE DIDN’T ARREST ENOUGH BABIES AT THE

46
00:01:29,156 --> 00:01:30,080
ARREST ENOUGH BABIES AT THE SOUTHERN BORDERS.

47
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:30,581
SOUTHERN BORDERS. BUT OKAY.

48
00:01:30,624 --> 00:01:32,049
BUT OKAY. WE’RE NOT GOING TO LITERALLY,

00:01:32,092 --> 00:01:34,151
WE’RE NOT GOING TO LITERALLY, WE’RE NOT GOING TO HAVE A

50
00:01:34,161 --> 00:01:35,285
WE’RE NOT GOING TO HAVE A COUNTRY LEFT BECAUSE OF THE

00:01:35,296 --> 00:01:36,387
COUNTRY LEFT BECAUSE OF THE NATIONAL DEBT.

52
00:01:36,430 --> 00:01:37,822

00:01:43,104 --> 00:01:44,395
GOING HAVE A COUNTRY LEFT BECAUSE AS PRESIDENT, HE HAS

00:02:07,028 --> 00:02:08,085
EVERY WEEK, EVERY YEAR WITH NO END IN SIGHT.

70
00:02:08,096 --> 00:02:10,321
END IN SIGHT. THE TRUMP TAX CUTS HAVE

71
00:02:10,330 --> 00:02:11,689
THE TRUMP TAX CUTS HAVE SIGNIFICANTLY ACCELERATED WHAT

72
00:02:11,699 --> 00:02:15,726
SIGNIFICANTLY ACCELERATED WHAT IS NOW DONALD TRUMP’S RUSH TO A

73
00:02:15,770 --> 00:02:18,128
IS NOW DONALD TRUMP’S RUSH TO A FISCAL CRISIS, MUCH WORSE THAN

74
00:02:18,139 --> 00:02:20,999
FISCAL CRISIS, MUCH WORSE THAN ANYTHING HE ENCOUNTERED IN HIS

75
00:02:21,042 --> 00:02:22,333
ANYTHING HE ENCOUNTERED IN HIS ATLANTIC CITY CASINO

76
00:02:22,343 --> 00:02:22,734
ATLANTIC CITY CASINO BANKRUPTCIES.

77
00:02:22,777 --> 00:02:23,468
BANKRUPTCIES. THE TRUMP TARIFFS ARE DOING

78
00:02:23,511 --> 00:02:24,235
THE TRUMP TARIFFS ARE DOING THEIR PART TOO.

79
00:02:24,278 --> 00:02:26,404
THEIR PART TOO. THEY ARE ALREADY COSTING JOBS IN

80
00:02:26,447 --> 00:02:28,105
THEY ARE ALREADY COSTING JOBS IN THE UNITED STATES, EVEN THOUGH

81
00:02:28,116 --> 00:02:30,608
THE UNITED STATES, EVEN THOUGH DONALD TRUMP BELIEVED THAT THE

82
00:02:30,619 --> 00:02:32,310
DONALD TRUMP BELIEVED THAT THE TARIFFS WOULD SAVE JOBS.

83
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:34,112
TARIFFS WOULD SAVE JOBS. THE TRUMP TARIFFS HAVE ACTUALLY

84
00:02:34,122 --> 00:02:35,647
THE TRUMP TARIFFS HAVE ACTUALLY CREATED AN INCENTIVE FOR

85
00:02:35,657 --> 00:02:38,049
CREATED AN INCENTIVE FOR AMERICAN MANUFACTURERS LIKE

86
00:02:38,059 --> 00:02:39,717
AMERICAN MANUFACTURERS LIKE HARLEY-DAVIDSON TO MOVE

87
00:02:39,727 --> 00:02:41,052
HARLEY-DAVIDSON TO MOVE PRODUCTION TO FOREIGN COUNTRIES

88
00:02:41,095 --> 00:02:42,520
PRODUCTION TO FOREIGN COUNTRIES BECAUSE THE EUROPEAN UNION HAS

89
00:02:42,564 --> 00:02:45,523
BECAUSE THE EUROPEAN UNION HAS ANNOUNCED RETALIATORY TARIFFS

90
00:02:45,534 --> 00:02:48,126
ANNOUNCED RETALIATORY TARIFFS AGAINST THE TRUMP TARIFFS ON

91
00:02:48,136 --> 00:02:49,961
AGAINST THE TRUMP TARIFFS ON PRODUCTS SOLD IN EUROPE THAT ARE

92
00:02:50,005 --> 00:02:51,129
PRODUCTS SOLD IN EUROPE THAT ARE MADE IN THE USA.

93
00:02:51,172 --> 00:02:52,263
MADE IN THE USA. NO SURPRISE THAT THEY WERE GOING

94
00:02:52,273 --> 00:02:52,964
NO SURPRISE THAT THEY WERE GOING TO DO THAT.

95
00:02:53,007 --> 00:02:56,100
TO DO THAT. AND SO HARLEY-DAVIDSON QUITE

96
00:02:56,144 --> 00:02:57,836
AND SO HARLEY-DAVIDSON QUITE LOGICALLY CANNOT CONTINUE TO

97
00:02:57,846 --> 00:03:00,772
LOGICALLY CANNOT CONTINUE TO SELL HARLEY-DAVIDSONS MADE IN

98
00:03:00,782 --> 00:03:02,340
SELL HARLEY-DAVIDSONS MADE IN THE USA IN EUROPE THANKS TO

99
00:03:02,350 --> 00:03:02,774
THE USA IN EUROPE THANKS TO DONALD TRUMP.

100
00:03:02,784 --> 00:03:05,076
DONALD TRUMP. SO THEY WILL MAKE THEM IN SOME

101
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:05,843
SO THEY WILL MAKE THEM IN SOME OTHER COUNTRY.

102
00:03:05,887 --> 00:03:07,345
OTHER COUNTRY. AND THEN SELL THEM IN EUROPE.

103
00:03:07,355 --> 00:03:08,980
AND THEN SELL THEM IN EUROPE. THE TRUMP RESPONSE TO THAT, OF

104
00:03:09,023 --> 00:03:11,716
THE TRUMP RESPONSE TO THAT, OF COURSE, IS A SERIES OF ANGRY AND

105
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:13,485
COURSE, IS A SERIES OF ANGRY AND UTTERLY INCOHERENT AND

UTTERLY INCOHERENT AND ECONOMICALLY ILLITERATE TWEETS.

107
00:03:15,196 --> 00:03:16,454
ECONOMICALLY ILLITERATE TWEETS. THE HARLEY-DAVIDSON STORY HAS

108
00:03:16,464 --> 00:03:19,157
THE HARLEY-DAVIDSON STORY HAS BEEN A BAD ONE FOR PRESIDENT

109
00:03:19,167 --> 00:03:20,492
BEEN A BAD ONE FOR PRESIDENT TRUMP, BUT AT LEAST, AT LEAST NO

US TO TALK ABOUT. BUT THE NATIONAL DEBT IS IT.

128
00:03:49,698 --> 00:03:51,390
BUT THE NATIONAL DEBT IS IT. AND IT IS GOING TO BE

129
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:54,426
AND IT IS GOING TO BE FASCINATING TO TRY TO SEE HOW

FASCINATING TO TRY TO SEE HOW THE REPUBLICAN PARTY TURNS

THE REPUBLICAN PARTY TURNS AROUND, AS IT HAS ON RUSSIA AND

DEBT IS GOOD, A HIGHER AND HIGHER NATIONAL DEBT IS A GOOD

135
00:04:05,747 --> 00:04:07,239
HIGHER NATIONAL DEBT IS A GOOD THING BECAUSE THAT SEEMS TO BE

136
00:04:07,249 --> 00:04:09,007
THING BECAUSE THAT SEEMS TO BE THE ONLY WAY FOR DONALD TRUMP TO

137
00:04:09,017 --> 00:04:09,641
THE ONLY WAY FOR DONALD TRUMP TO ADDRESS IT.

138
00:04:09,684 --> 00:04:10,408
ADDRESS IT. BECAUSE THERE IS NOTHING THEY’RE

139
00:04:10,452 --> 00:04:12,945
BECAUSE THERE IS NOTHING THEY’RE GOING TO DO TO BRING IT DOWN.

140
00:04:12,955 --> 00:04:14,513
GOING TO DO TO BRING IT DOWN. >> YEAH.

141
00:04:14,523 --> 00:04:15,914
>> YEAH. I MEAN, THEY’RE NOT ONLY NOT

00:04:19,762 --> 00:04:23,722
SKYROCKETING IT UP. THIS IS THE STORY OF A PROMISE

146
00:04:23,733 --> 00:04:24,456
THIS IS THE STORY OF A PROMISE BROKEN AND AN ODD PROMISE KEPT

147
00:04:24,466 --> 00:04:25,824
BROKEN AND AN ODD PROMISE KEPT TRUMP PROMISE HEAD WOULD GET RID

00:04:25,834 --> 00:04:27,826
TRUMP PROMISE HEAD WOULD GET RID OF ALL THE NATIONAL DEBT, TOTAL,

00:04:27,836 --> 00:04:29,328
OF ALL THE NATIONAL DEBT, TOTAL, WIPE IT OUT WHILE HE WAS

150
00:04:29,338 --> 00:04:29,662
WIPE IT OUT WHILE HE WAS PRESIDENT.

151
00:04:29,705 --> 00:04:30,630
PRESIDENT. INSTEAD HE IS GOING TO RAISE TO

152
00:04:30,673 --> 00:04:31,463
INSTEAD HE IS GOING TO RAISE TO IT A RECORD LEVEL.

153
00:04:31,474 --> 00:04:33,165
IT A RECORD LEVEL. THAT’S A BIG PROMISE BROKEN.

154
00:04:33,175 --> 00:04:34,767
THAT’S A BIG PROMISE BROKEN. THE PROMISE HE HAS KEPT IS HE

155
00:04:34,777 --> 00:04:37,069
THE PROMISE HE HAS KEPT IS HE SAID HIS DEFICIT WOULD BE

156
00:04:37,079 --> 00:04:38,871
SAID HIS DEFICIT WOULD BE NOWHERE NEAR OBAMA’S DEFICIT OF

157
00:04:38,881 --> 00:04:39,438
NOWHERE NEAR OBAMA’S DEFICIT OF $400 MILLION.

158
00:04:39,448 --> 00:04:40,940
$400 MILLION. HE HAS KEPT THAT PROMISE.

159
00:04:40,950 --> 00:04:42,141
HE HAS KEPT THAT PROMISE. THEY’RE GOING RUN A TRILLION

160
00:04:42,151 --> 00:04:42,975
THEY’RE GOING RUN A TRILLION DOLLAR DEFICIT THIS YEAR.

161
00:04:42,985 --> 00:04:44,477
DOLLAR DEFICIT THIS YEAR. THAT’S NOWHERE NEAR WHAT OBAMA

162
00:04:44,487 --> 00:04:45,478
THAT’S NOWHERE NEAR WHAT OBAMA DID IN HIS LAST YEAR.

163
00:04:45,488 --> 00:04:45,945
DID IN HIS LAST YEAR. I AGREE.

164
00:04:45,955 --> 00:04:47,680
I AGREE. THEY’RE GOING HAVE TO TURN AND

165
00:04:47,690 --> 00:04:48,180
THEY’RE GOING HAVE TO TURN AND RUN.

166
00:04:48,224 --> 00:04:50,182
RUN. BUT IN THE END, RIGHT, THE BILL

167
00:04:50,192 --> 00:04:51,050
BUT IN THE END, RIGHT, THE BILL WILL COME DUE.

168
00:04:51,093 --> 00:04:52,151
WILL COME DUE. AND THE HORRIBLE THING ABOUT

169
00:04:52,161 --> 00:04:54,487
AND THE HORRIBLE THING ABOUT THIS IS JUST LAST WEEK, THE

170
00:04:54,530 --> 00:04:55,355
THIS IS JUST LAST WEEK, THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES, THE

171
00:04:55,398 --> 00:04:58,057
HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES, THE REPUBLICAN HOUSE PASSED A

172
00:04:58,067 --> 00:05:00,092
REPUBLICAN HOUSE PASSED A SO-CALLED FARM BILL THAT CUT

173
00:05:00,102 --> 00:05:01,360
SO-CALLED FARM BILL THAT CUT FOOD STAMPS, BECAUSE WE DON’T

174
00:05:01,370 --> 00:05:02,695
FOOD STAMPS, BECAUSE WE DON’T HAVE ENOUGH MONEY TO PUT FOOD ON

175
00:05:02,705 --> 00:05:03,896
HAVE ENOUGH MONEY TO PUT FOOD ON THE TABLE OF THE PEOPLE IN THIS

176
00:05:03,940 --> 00:05:05,097
THE TABLE OF THE PEOPLE IN THIS COUNTRY WHO LACK IT.

177
00:05:05,107 --> 00:05:06,665
COUNTRY WHO LACK IT. BUT WE HAD A TRILLION DOLLARS

178
00:05:06,709 --> 00:05:08,100
BUT WE HAD A TRILLION DOLLARS FOR TAX CUTS THAT ARE RUNG UP

179
00:05:08,144 --> 00:05:08,901
FOR TAX CUTS THAT ARE RUNG UP THE FEDERAL DEBT.

180
00:05:08,911 --> 00:05:10,403
THE FEDERAL DEBT. THAT’S JUST A HORRIBLE SET OF

181
00:05:10,413 --> 00:05:10,737
THAT’S JUST A HORRIBLE SET OF CHOICE.

182
00:05:10,780 --> 00:05:12,872
CHOICE. >> AND DAVID, THE LARGEST

183
00:05:12,882 --> 00:05:15,308

DEBT, WHICH YOU CAN HOLD SIMPLY BY BUYING TREASURY BONDS IS OF

BY BUYING TREASURY BONDS IS OF COURSE CHINA.

187
00:05:21,557 --> 00:05:23,049
COURSE CHINA. SO THIS -- AS THIS DEBT GOES UP,

SO THIS -- AS THIS DEBT GOES UP, AS IT BECOMES MORE BURDENSOME

AS IT BECOMES MORE BURDENSOME HERE IN THE UNITED STATES, CHINA

190
00:05:27,897 --> 00:05:30,790
HERE IN THE UNITED STATES, CHINA GAINS MORE AND MORE LEVERAGE AND

191
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:34,127
GAINS MORE AND MORE LEVERAGE AND CONTROL OVER THE PRESIDENT.

192
00:05:34,170 --> 00:05:36,162
CONTROL OVER THE PRESIDENT. >> THIS IS DONALD TRUMP’S BIG

193
00:05:36,205 --> 00:05:36,495
>> THIS IS DONALD TRUMP’S BIG CON.

194
00:05:36,506 --> 00:05:38,431
CON. YOU PLAYED IT OVER AND OVER

195
00:05:38,475 --> 00:05:38,731
YOU PLAYED IT OVER AND OVER AGAIN.

196
00:05:38,741 --> 00:05:41,000
AGAIN. HE MADE A PROMISE, AND HE CAUGHT

197
00:05:41,044 --> 00:05:42,035
HE MADE A PROMISE, AND HE CAUGHT THE HEADLINES.

198
00:05:42,045 --> 00:05:43,736
THE HEADLINES. HE WILL GET RID OF THE DEBT AND

199
00:05:43,747 --> 00:05:45,238
HE WILL GET RID OF THE DEBT AND HAVE SMALLER DEFICITS.

200
00:05:45,281 --> 00:05:49,876
HAVE SMALLER DEFICITS. WELL, YOU KNOW, THE BILL WILL

201
00:05:49,919 --> 00:05:50,543
WELL, YOU KNOW, THE BILL WILL COME DUE.

202
00:05:50,553 --> 00:05:51,944
COME DUE. BUT WE’RE LIVING IN A TIME NOW

203
00:05:51,955 --> 00:05:53,646
BUT WE’RE LIVING IN A TIME NOW WHERE THERE WILL BE NO

204
00:05:53,690 --> 00:05:54,680
WHERE THERE WILL BE NO ACKNOWLEDGMENT OF THAT.

205
00:05:54,724 --> 00:05:55,949
ACKNOWLEDGMENT OF THAT. TRUMP WILL NEVER ACKNOWLEDGE THE

206
00:05:55,992 --> 00:05:56,883
TRUMP WILL NEVER ACKNOWLEDGE THE REAL NUMBERS.

207
00:05:56,926 --> 00:05:58,251
REAL NUMBERS. THE REPUBLICANS WILL NEVER

208
00:05:58,261 --> 00:06:01,020
THE REPUBLICANS WILL NEVER ACKNOWLEDGE THE REAL NUMBERS.

209
00:06:01,030 --> 00:06:02,455
ACKNOWLEDGE THE REAL NUMBERS. WHERE ARE THE BOB DOLES OF THE

210
00:06:02,498 --> 00:06:02,755
WHERE ARE THE BOB DOLES OF THE WORLD?

211
00:06:02,766 --> 00:06:03,790
WORLD? THEY’VE GONE AWAY.

212
00:06:03,833 --> 00:06:04,958
THEY’VE GONE AWAY. NO REPUBLICAN CARES ABOUT THE

213
00:06:05,001 --> 00:06:06,259
NO REPUBLICAN CARES ABOUT THE DEFICIT ANYMORE.

214
00:06:06,269 --> 00:06:08,161
DEFICIT ANYMORE. AND EVEN NOW, THE HOUSE

215
00:06:08,171 --> 00:06:09,996
AND EVEN NOW, THE HOUSE REPUBLICANS HAVE SAID THAT COME

216
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:11,865
REPUBLICANS HAVE SAID THAT COME THE FALL, THEY ARE GOING TO PASS

217
00:06:11,875 --> 00:06:14,868
THE FALL, THEY ARE GOING TO PASS OR TRY TO PASS ANOTHER TAX BILL

218
00:06:14,911 --> 00:06:16,603
OR TRY TO PASS ANOTHER TAX BILL THAT WOULD MAKE PERMANENT SOME

219
00:06:16,646 --> 00:06:19,272
THAT WOULD MAKE PERMANENT SOME OF THE TAX CUTS IN THE PREVIOUS

220
00:06:19,315 --> 00:06:22,809
OF THE TAX CUTS IN THE PREVIOUS TAX BILL, AND THAT WOULD EVEN

221
00:06:22,852 --> 00:06:24,277
TAX BILL, AND THAT WOULD EVEN EXPLODE THE DEFICIT AND THE DEBT

222
00:06:24,287 --> 00:06:24,978
EXPLODE THE DEFICIT AND THE DEBT MUCH MORE THAN IN THE NUMBERS

223
00:06:24,988 --> 00:06:27,047
MUCH MORE THAN IN THE NUMBERS THAT CAME OUT TODAY.

224
00:06:27,057 --> 00:06:30,183
THAT CAME OUT TODAY. SO THEY ARE NOT DOING ANYTHING

225
00:06:30,227 --> 00:06:32,285
SO THEY ARE NOT DOING ANYTHING EXCEPT COMPLAINING ABOUT

226
00:06:32,295 --> 00:06:33,419
EXCEPT COMPLAINING ABOUT SPENDING, BECAUSE THAT’S THE

227
00:06:33,463 --> 00:06:34,054
SPENDING, BECAUSE THAT’S THE WHOLE GOAL HERE.

228
00:06:34,064 --> 00:06:36,089
WHOLE GOAL HERE. THEY’RE GOING TO USE THIS DEBT

229
00:06:36,133 --> 00:06:37,958
THEY’RE GOING TO USE THIS DEBT TO SAY, WELL, WE CAN’T SPEND

230
00:06:38,001 --> 00:06:39,493
TO SAY, WELL, WE CAN’T SPEND MONEY ON THE FOOD STAMPS THAT

231
00:06:39,503 --> 00:06:40,594
MONEY ON THE FOOD STAMPS THAT YOU JUST MENTIONED.

232
00:06:40,637 --> 00:06:42,262
YOU JUST MENTIONED. WE’RE GOING HAVE TO SQUEEZE

233
00:06:42,305 --> 00:06:42,996
WE’RE GOING HAVE TO SQUEEZE MEDICARE AND SOCIAL SECURITY

234
00:06:43,006 --> 00:06:44,164
MEDICARE AND SOCIAL SECURITY BECAUSE WE’RE GOING TO HAVE TO

235
00:06:44,174 --> 00:06:45,966
BECAUSE WE’RE GOING TO HAVE TO BE PAYING FOR SERVICING THE

236
00:06:45,976 --> 00:06:46,266
BE PAYING FOR SERVICING THE DEBT.

237
00:06:46,276 --> 00:06:50,103
DEBT. >> AND ANYONE UP THERE HOZWHO HA

238
00:06:50,147 --> 00:06:51,905
>> AND ANYONE UP THERE HOZWHO HA HAD CREDIT CARD DEBT, THIS

239
00:06:51,915 --> 00:06:52,773
HAD CREDIT CARD DEBT, THIS BEHAVES LIKE CREDIT CARD DEBT.

240
00:06:52,816 --> 00:06:55,108
BEHAVES LIKE CREDIT CARD DEBT. IT’S THE MOST EXPENSIVE KIND OF

241
00:06:55,118 --> 00:06:55,909
IT’S THE MOST EXPENSIVE KIND OF DEBT YOU CAN ENCOUNTER.

242
00:06:55,919 --> 00:06:57,110
DEBT YOU CAN ENCOUNTER. AS THIS DEBT GOES UP, THE

243
00:06:57,154 --> 00:06:59,112
AS THIS DEBT GOES UP, THE INTEREST ON THE DEBT GOES UP

244
00:06:59,122 --> 00:06:59,546
INTEREST ON THE DEBT GOES UP DRAMATICALLY.

245
00:06:59,590 --> 00:07:01,281
DRAMATICALLY. AND, RON, THAT INTEREST ON THE

246
00:07:01,292 --> 00:07:03,917
AND, RON, THAT INTEREST ON THE DEBT EATS UP IN THE BUDGET EVERY

247
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:04,217
DEBT EATS UP IN THE BUDGET EVERY YEAR.

248
00:07:04,228 --> 00:07:05,953
YEAR. NO ONE MENTIONS IT, BUT IT IS

249
00:07:05,996 --> 00:07:07,921
NO ONE MENTIONS IT, BUT IT IS ONE OF THE LARGEST PIECE OF THE

250
00:07:07,931 --> 00:07:09,189
ONE OF THE LARGEST PIECE OF THE BUDGET, GETTING BIGGER AND

251
00:07:09,199 --> 00:07:09,890
BUDGET, GETTING BIGGER AND BIGGER EVERY YEAR.

252
00:07:09,900 --> 00:07:13,026
BIGGER EVERY YEAR. AND IT’S ON TRACK TO BECOME THE

253
00:07:13,036 --> 00:07:16,329
AND IT’S ON TRACK TO BECOME THE LARGEST SPENDING ITEM IN THE

254
00:07:16,340 --> 00:07:18,632
LARGEST SPENDING ITEM IN THE BUDGET, DWARFING ALL OF THE

255
00:07:18,676 --> 00:07:19,733
BUDGET, DWARFING ALL OF THE DISCRETIONARY SPENDING IN THE

256
00:07:19,743 --> 00:07:20,067
DISCRETIONARY SPENDING IN THE BUDGET.

257
00:07:20,110 --> 00:07:21,702
BUDGET. AND WHAT THAT MEANS IS IT WIPES

258
00:07:21,712 --> 00:07:23,404
AND WHAT THAT MEANS IS IT WIPES OUT THAT SPENDING ON EDUCATION,

259
00:07:23,414 --> 00:07:25,839
OUT THAT SPENDING ON EDUCATION, ON ALL SORTS OF PROBLEMS, ALL

260
00:07:25,850 --> 00:07:27,241
ON ALL SORTS OF PROBLEMS, ALL SORTS OF ISSUES OUT THERE THAT

261
00:07:27,284 --> 00:07:29,443
SORTS OF ISSUES OUT THERE THAT ALL HAVE TO GO INTO BASICALLY

262
00:07:29,453 --> 00:07:30,577
ALL HAVE TO GO INTO BASICALLY ZERO SPENDING MODES JUST IN

263
00:07:30,621 --> 00:07:31,712
ZERO SPENDING MODES JUST IN ORDER TO PAY YOUR DEBT.

264
00:07:31,722 --> 00:07:32,346
ORDER TO PAY YOUR DEBT. >> YEAH.

265
00:07:32,389 --> 00:07:34,582
>> YEAH. IT SEEMS LIKE TRUMP IS RUNNING A

266
00:07:34,625 --> 00:07:36,350
IT SEEMS LIKE TRUMP IS RUNNING A CONTEST BETWEEN TRYING TO RUN UP

267
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:37,551
CONTEST BETWEEN TRYING TO RUN UP THE PENTAGON BUDGET AND RUN UP

268
00:07:37,561 --> 00:07:39,253
THE PENTAGON BUDGET AND RUN UP THE DEBT TO SEE WHICH NUMBER CAN

269
00:07:39,263 --> 00:07:42,923
THE DEBT TO SEE WHICH NUMBER CAN BE LARGER IN OUR BUDGET.

270
00:07:42,933 --> 00:07:44,458
BE LARGER IN OUR BUDGET. INTEREST PAYMENTS ON THE DEBT OR

271
00:07:44,501 --> 00:07:45,192
INTEREST PAYMENTS ON THE DEBT OR INCREASINGLY LARGE PAYMENTS TO

272
00:07:45,236 --> 00:07:47,428
INCREASINGLY LARGE PAYMENTS TO THE PENTAGON.

273
00:07:47,438 --> 00:07:49,263
THE PENTAGON. BUT LOOK, LAWRENCE, I THINK THE

274
00:07:49,273 --> 00:07:50,631
BUT LOOK, LAWRENCE, I THINK THE SCARIEST THING OF ALL IS WE’RE

275
00:07:50,641 --> 00:07:52,733
SCARIEST THING OF ALL IS WE’RE SEEING THESE KINDS OF NUMBERS AT

276
00:07:52,743 --> 00:07:55,236
SEEING THESE KINDS OF NUMBERS AT A TIME OF RELATIVE PROSPERITY.

277
00:07:55,246 --> 00:07:56,670
A TIME OF RELATIVE PROSPERITY. SOONER OR LATER, THE BUSINESS

278
00:07:56,681 --> 00:07:57,771
SOONER OR LATER, THE BUSINESS CYCLE WILL TURN.

279
00:07:57,782 --> 00:07:59,373
CYCLE WILL TURN. AND IF TRUMP KEEPS PRESSING

280
00:07:59,384 --> 00:08:00,975
AND IF TRUMP KEEPS PRESSING THESE TARIFFS, IT WILL TURN

281
00:08:00,985 --> 00:08:01,942
THESE TARIFFS, IT WILL TURN SOONER RATHER THAN LATER.

282
00:08:01,953 --> 00:08:03,477
SOONER RATHER THAN LATER. AND THAT MEANS THAT THE DEFICIT

283
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:04,545
AND THAT MEANS THAT THE DEFICIT WILL JUST EXPLODE EVEN MORE.

284
00:08:04,588 --> 00:08:06,180
WILL JUST EXPLODE EVEN MORE. WE’LL SEE THE TRUMP RECESSION.

285
00:08:06,223 --> 00:08:07,048
WE’LL SEE THE TRUMP RECESSION. IT WILL COME.

286
00:08:07,091 --> 00:08:08,482
IT WILL COME. AND THEN THESE NUMBERS WILL LOOK

287
00:08:08,492 --> 00:08:09,883
AND THEN THESE NUMBERS WILL LOOK WORSE AND WORSE AND WORSE.

288
00:08:09,894 --> 00:08:11,385
WORSE AND WORSE AND WORSE. AND THE GOVERNMENT WILL BE OUT

289
00:08:11,429 --> 00:08:13,387
AND THE GOVERNMENT WILL BE OUT OF DRY FISCAL POWDER TO TRY TO

290
00:08:13,397 --> 00:08:14,421
OF DRY FISCAL POWDER TO TRY TO STIMULATE THE ECONOMY OR DO

291
00:08:14,465 --> 00:08:15,590
STIMULATE THE ECONOMY OR DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT.

292
00:08:15,633 --> 00:08:16,558
SOMETHING ABOUT IT. TONIGHT’S NEWS IS BAD.

293
00:08:16,601 --> 00:08:17,959
TONIGHT’S NEWS IS BAD. BUT THE FUTURE NEWS IS EVEN

294
00:08:17,969 --> 00:08:18,259
BUT THE FUTURE NEWS IS EVEN WORSE.

295
00:08:18,269 --> 00:08:20,461
WORSE. >> IT’S A VERY DIFFICULT SUBJECT

296
00:08:20,471 --> 00:08:22,797
>> IT’S A VERY DIFFICULT SUBJECT TO RUN CAMPAIGNS ON BECAUSE THE

TO RUN CAMPAIGNS ON BECAUSE THE PUBLIC DOES NOT EASILY GRASP IT.

298
00:08:25,143 --> 00:08:27,635
PUBLIC DOES NOT EASILY GRASP IT. AND IT DOESN’T HAVE ANY OF THE

299

AND IT DOESN’T HAVE ANY OF THE EXCITEMENT OF SOME OF THE OTHER

EXCITEMENT OF SOME OF THE OTHER THINGS THAT COME OUT IN THE
