>>> I'M GOING TO TAKE YOU LIVE 
TO FORT DRUM, NEW YORK, WHERE 
VICE PRESIDENT PENCE IS 
SPEAKING. 
>> FROM THE EARLIEST DAYS OF 
OUR ADMINISTRATION, YOUR 
COMMANDER IN CHIEF HAS BEEN 
FULFILLING HIS SOLEMN OATH TO 
PROVIDE FOR THE COMMON DEFENSE. 
AND PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP 
ALWAYS PUTS OUR ARMED FORCES 
AND YOUR FAMILIES FIRST. 
I'VE SEEN IT FIRSTHAND. 
ON OUR VERY FIRST DAY IN 
OFFICE, I WITNESSED PRESIDENT 
TRUMP PROTECT OUR MILITARY FROM 
A GOVERNMENT WIDE HIRING FREEZE 
AND IN MAY OF LAST YEAR, HE 
SIGNED THE LARGEST INCREASE IN 
MILITARY SPENDING IN NEARLY A 
DECADE. 
AND WITH THE LEADERSHIP AND 
SUPPORT OF THIS COMMANDER IN 
CHIEF, OUR ARMED FORCES HAVE 
TAKEN THE FIGHT TO THE 
TERRORISTS OF ISIS ON OUR 
TERMS, ON THEIR SOIL. 
THEIR CALAFATE HAS CRUMBLED AND 
SOON WE WILL ERASE ISIS FROM 
THE FACE OF THE EARTH. 
AND LAST AUGUST, LAST AUGUST 
OUR PRESIDENT LAID OUT OUR 
SOUTH ASIA STRATEGY TO GIVE OUR 
WAR FIGHTERS IN AFGHANISTAN IN 
HIS WORDS, THE TOOLS THEY NEED 
AND THE TRUST THEY'VE EARNED TO 
FIGHT AND WIN. 
THIS PRESIDENT HAS ALSO SECURED 
COMMITMENTS. 
AROUND THE WORLD FROM OUR 
ALLIES, COMMITMENTS FROM OUR 
NATO ALLIES IN PARTICULAR TO 
PAY MORE FOR OUR COMMON DEFENSE 
THAN EVER BEFORE. 
AND PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS 
ARTICULATED A VISION TO ENSURE 
CONTINUED AMERICAN DOMINANCE IN 
LAND, SEA, AIR, AND SPACE. 
AND LAST FALL, OUR PRESIDENT 
LED NEGOTIATIONS WITH BOTH 
PARTIES OF CONGRESS AND 
PRESIDENT TRUMP SIGNED INTO LAW 
THE LARGEST INCREASE IN OUR 
NATIONAL DEFENSE IN A 
GENERATION. 
UNDER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP, 
THE DAYS OF ARBITRARY BUDGET 
CUTS TO OUR NATIONAL DEFENSE 
ARE OVER. 
AND FINALLY IN JUNE OF THIS 
YEAR, WHILE OUR PRESIDENT 
ENGAGED IN HISTORIC 
NEGOTIATIONS WITH NORTH KOREA, 
HE HAD OUR MISSING FALLEN ON 
HIS HEART. 
AND AS THE NATION WITNESSED 
JUST A FEW SHORT WEEKS AGO, 
THANKS TO THE LEADERSHIP AND 
COMPASSION OF THIS COMMANDER IN 
CHIEF, OUR BOYS ARE FINALLY 
COMING HOME. 
BY SIGNING THIS LEGISLATION 
TODAY, PRESIDENT TRUMP IS 
KEEPING HIS PROMISE TO THE 
AMERICAN PEOPLE TO REBUILD OUR 
MILITARY, RESTORE THE ARSENAL 
OF DEMOCRACY, AND ONCE AGAIN, 
GIVE YOU, OUR SOLDIERS, 
SAILORS, AIRMEN, MARINES AND 
COAST GUARD, THE RESOURCES AND 
TRAINING YOU NEED TO ACCOMPLISH 
YOUR MISSION AND COME HOME 
SAFE. 
THE ARMED FORCES OF THE UNITED 
STATES OF AMERICA ARE THE 
WORLD'S GREATEST FORCE FOR 
GOOD, AND YOU CAN BE ASSURED 
PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP AND OUR 
ENTIRE ADMINISTRATION WILL 
NEVER STOP FIGHTING FOR YOU WHO 
FIGHT TO DEFEND THIS NATION, 
PAST, PRESENT AND FUTURE. 
SO NOW IT IS MY HIGH HONOR AND 
DISTINCT PRIVILEGE TO INTRODUCE 
TO YOU YOUR COMMANDER IN CHIEF 
AND A TRUE CHAMPION OF THE MEN 
AND WOMEN OF THE ARMED FORCES 
OF THE UNITED STATES OF 
AMERICA, THE 45TH PRESIDENT OF 
THE UNITED STATES, PRESIDENT 
DONALD TRUMP. 
 
>> THANK YOU, EVERYBODY. 
IT'S A GREAT PLACE. 
I'VE BEEN HERE BEFORE. 
WE LOVE THIS LOCATION. 
WE LOVE THIS BASE AND MOST 
PARTICULARLY THE PEOPLE THAT 
ARE WORKING SO HARD HERE AND SO 
EFFECTIVELY. 
I WANT TO START BY SAYING AT 
EASE. 
JUST RELAX. 
DO YOU HAVE SEATS. 
YOU CAN SIT DOWN, COME ON. 
OR IF YOU WANT TO STAND, YOU 
CAN. 
WE'LL JUST GET ONE BIG STANDING 
OVATION, RIGHT. 
SIT DOWN. 
THANK YOU. 
THAT'S PRETTY GOOD. 
EVERYBODY'S GOT A SEAT. 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH. 
I WANT TO THANK OUR WONDERFUL 
VICE PRESIDENT, MIKE PENCE, AND 
SAY A SPECIAL HELLO TO THE 
INCREDIBLE PATRIOTS OF FORT 
DRUM, AND THE TENTH MOUNTAIN 
DIVISION, SPECIAL PEOPLE. 
THANK YOU. 
A FEW MOMENTS AGO, I WITNESSED 
YOUR EXTRAORDINARY CAPABILITIES 
FIRSTHAND, DURING AN ARTILLERY 
RAID DEMONSTRATION, SO I WOULD 
LIKE TO BEGIN BY APPLAUDING THE 
TENTH MOUNTAIN DIVISION COMBAT 
AVIATION BRIGADE ALONG WITH THE 
THIRD BATTALION, 6TH FIELD 
ARTILLERY. 
I HATE TO SAY THIS, BUT NOBODY 
STANDS A CHANCE AGAINST YOU 
FOLKS. 
NOBODY STANDS A CHANCE. 
I'M HERE TODAY TO SIGN OUR NEW 
DEFENSE BILL INTO LAW AND TO 
PAY TRIBUTE TO THE GREATEST 
SOLDIERS IN THE HISTORY OF THE 
WORLD, THE UNITED STATES ARMY. 
THANK YOU. 
THANK YOU. 
THE NATIONAL DEFENSE 
AUTHORIZATION ACT IS THE MOST 
SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENT IN OUR 
MILITARY AND OUR WAR FIGHTERS 
IN MODERN HISTORY AND I AM VERY 
PROUD TO BE A BIG, BIG PART OF 
IT. 
IT WAS NOT VERY HARD. 
YOU KNOW, I WENT TO CONGRESS, I 
SAID LET'S DO IT. 
WE GOT TO DO IT. 
WE'RE GOING TO STRENGTHEN OUR 
MILITARY LIKE NEVER EVER 
BEFORE, AND THAT'S WHAT WE DID. 
I WANT TO SAY VERY STRONGLY, 
THERE IS NO BETTER PLACE THAN 
RIGHT HERE AT FORT DRUM TO 
CELEBRATE ITS PASSAGE. 
NO BETTER PLACE. 
AFTER YEARS OF DEVASTATING 
CUTS, WE'RE NOW REBUILDING OUR 
MILITARY LIKE WE NEVER HAVE 
BEFORE, EVER. 
BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT TO SURVIVE 
AND HAVING THAT SURVIVAL OF OUR 
FREEDOM, IT DEPENDS UPON THE 
MIGHT OF OUR MILITARY. 
AND NO ENEMY ON EARTH CAN MATCH 
THE STRENGTH, COURAGE AND SKILL 
OF THE AMERICAN ARMY AND THE 
AMERICAN ARMED FORCES. 
NOBODY'S EVEN CLOSE. 
THEY NEVER WILL BE. 
WE'RE GRATEFUL TO BE JOINED 
TODAY BY MANY OF OUR NATION'S 
TOP MILITARY LEADERS. 
I'D LIKE TO RECOGNIZE DEPUTY 
SECRETARY OF DEFENSE, SHANAHAN 
WHO'S WITH US. 
PLEASE, JUST A SECOND. 
PEOPLE I'VE HEARD ABOUT ALL MY 
LIFE, VERY PRESTIGIOUS TITLE, 
I'VE ALWAYS LIKED THE RING, THE 
JOINT CHIEFS OF STAFF, RIGHT, 
THAT'S GOT A GOOD RING. 
ANYBODY IN THE AUDIENCE GOING 
TO BE A MEMBER OF THAT SOMEDAY, 
I THINK SO. 
RAISE YOUR HAND. 
IF YOU THINK YOU'RE GOING TO 
MAKE IT, RAISE YOUR HAND, GO 
AHEAD. 
COME ON. 
THAT'S ALL. 
ONLY A FEW. 
I DON'T KNOW. 
I WANT TO THANK GENERAL 
DUNFORD, GENERAL MILLIE, 
GENERAL KNELLER, ADMIRAL 
RICHARDSON, GENERAL GOLDFINE, 
GENERAL ENVO, AND VICE ADMIRAL 
RAY, THANK YOU FOR YOUR 
LEADERSHIP.

MOUNTAIN DIVISION. 
MAJOR GENERAL WALT PIAT, WHAT A 
SPECIAL MAN. 
WALT, I WANT TO THANK YOU. 
WHERE IS WALT? 
WALT, THANK YOU VERY MUCH. 
THANK YOU. 
WALT IS BACK ON AMERICAN SOIL 
AFTER A DEPLOYMENT IN IRAQ, AND 
I JUST WANT TO WELCOME YOU 
HOME. 
WE HAVE TREMENDOUS RESPECT. 
WE HAVE GREAT ADMIRATION AND 
REPRESENT FOR YOU, WALT, THANK 
YOU VERY MUCH. 
I ALSO JUST HAD THE CHANCE TO 
MEET DIVISION COMMAND SERGEANT 
MAJOR JASON RAORK ALONG WITH 
10TH MOUNTAIN DIVISION SOLDIER 
OF THE YEAR, MICHAEL LIMA. 
WHERE IS MICHAEL, SOLDIER OF 
THE YEAR. 
MICHAEL. 
PRETTY GOOD. 
>> AND THAT SOLDIER OF THE 
YEAR, MICHAEL, OUT OF HOW MANY? 
HOW MANY? 
>> THAT'S A LOT OF SOLDIERS. 
18,000. 
DO YOU WANT TO WORK FOR ME? 
THANK YOU, MICHAEL. 
GREAT JOB. 
WE WOULD NOT BE HERE FOR 
TODAY'S SIGNING CEREMONY 
WITHOUT THE DEDICATED EFFORTS 
OF THE MEMBERS OF CONGRESS WHO 
WORK SO HARD TO PASS THE 
NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION 
ACT. 
I'D LIKE TO RECOGNIZE 
CONGRESSWOMAN ELISE STEPHKNACK 
WHOSE DISTRICT PROUDLY INCLUDED 
FORT DRUM. 
I HAVE TO TELL YOU ABOUT ELISE. 
SHE CALLED ME SO MANY TIMES, 
SHE SAID SHE WANTED ME TO BE 
HERE, I SAID I WON'T BE ABLE 
TO, WE'LL HAVE TO CHANGE A LOT 
OF SCHEDULING. 
BUT THAT DIDN'T SUIT HER. 
SHE DIDN'T STOP. 
AND HERE I AM. 
HERE I AM. 
ELISE, COME HERE.
COME HERE, ELISE. 
>>> THANK YOU MR.  PRESIDENT, 
IT IS TRULY AN HONOR TO WELCOME 
YOU TO FORT DRUM, HOME OF THE 
HISTORIC TENTH MOUNTAIN 
DIVISION, THE MOST DEPLOYED 
UNIT IN THE U.S. ARMY SINCE 
9/11. 
THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE TO 
SIGN THE HISTORIC NATIONAL 
DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION ACT WHICH 
INCLUDES THE LARGEST PAY 
INCREASE, SUPPORT FOR OUR 
MILITARY FAMILIES AND INVESTING 
IN OUR MILITARY READINESS. 
CLIMB TO GLORY, TENTH MOUNTAIN 
DIVISION. 
THANK YOU. 
>> SHE'S AN INCREDIBLE 
REPRESENTATIVE. 
I ALSO WANT TO THANK 
REPRESENTATIVES DON BAKE E DAN 
DONOVAN AND JOE WILSON WHO ARE 
HERE TODAY ALSO. 
STAND UP. 
THANK YOU, FELLOWS. 
THERE'S ANOTHER MEMBER OF 
CONGRESS HERE TODAY WHO IS NOT 
ONLY AN AIR FORCE VETERAN BUT 
THE FIRST WOMAN EVER TO FLY A 
FIGHTER JET IN COMBAT IN U.S. 
HISTORY. 
AND I'VE GOTTEN TO KNOW HER 
VERY WELL, AND SHE IS TERRIFIC. 
CONGRESSWOMAN MARTHA McSALLY. 
CONGRESSWOMAN. 
THANK YOU, MARTHA. 
THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE. 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH. 
THANK YOU ALL FOR FIGHTING FOR 
OUR MILITARY AND FOR FIGHTING 
FOR OUR VETS. 
NOBODY HAS MADE MORE PROGRESS 
ON ANYTHING THAN WHAT WE HAVE 
DONE WITH OUR VETS. 
WE HAVE CHOICE APPROVED, YOU 
KNOW THAT. 
WE HAVE SO MANY OTHER THINGS 
APPROVED FOR OUR VETS AND IT'S 
REALLY MOVING ALONG WELL. 
I THINK MAYBE ALMOST AS 
IMPORTANT AS CHOICE IS 
ACCOUNTABILITY. 
NOW WHEN WE FIND SOMEBODY NOT 
TREATING OUR VETS PROPERLY, YOU 
KNOW WHAT WE SAY, RIGHT, YOU'RE 
OUT. 
GET OUT. 
YOU'RE FIRED. 
GET OUT. 
THEY COULDN'T DO THAT. 
NOW THEY CAN DO IT. 
NOW THEY HAVE TO TREAT OUR VETS 
PROPERLY. 
OUR  VETS ARE OUR GREAT PEOPLE. 
AND THEY GET TREATED PROPERLY. 
YOU HAVE CHOICE AND YOU HAVE 
ACCOUNTABILITY, AND NOBODY 
THOUGHT THAT WOULD GET APPROVE 
LED. 
-- GET APPROVED. 
THEY WERE TRYING FOR DECADES 
AND I WANT TO THANK ALL OF THE 
AMAIDSING SPOUSES AND FAMILY 
MEMBERS -- AMAZING SPOUSES AND 
FAMILY MEMBERS, WHOSE LOVE AND 
SUPPORT, THEY MAKE IT POSSIBLE. 
PLEASE, THANK YOU. 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH. 
THEY KNOW. 
THEY KNOW. 
RIGHT. 
LOOK AT THEM. 
HE'S SMILING. 
THEY KNOW. 
LAST YEAR WE SECURED A 
HISTORIC, $700 BILLION TO 
REBUILD OUR MILITARY, AND NOW, 
THE NATIONAL DEFENSE 
AUTHORIZATION ACT PAVES THE WAY 
FOR ANOTHER 1700, LISTEN TO 
THIS NOW, SO WE HAVE BEEN 
TRYING TO GET MONEY. 
THEY NEVER GAVE US MONEY FOR 
THE MILITARY FOR YEARS AND 
YEARS, AND IT WAS DEPLETED. 
WE GOT $700 BILLION, AND NEXT 
YEAR, ALREADY APPROVED, WE HAVE 
$716 BILLION TO GIVE YOU THE 
FINEST PLANES AND SHIPS AND 
TANKS AND MISSILES, ANYWHERE ON 
EARTH, NOBODY MAKES THEM LIKE 
WE DO, AND VERY VERY FAR 
DISTANCE IN THIS CASE, JOBS ARE 
VERY IMPORTANT IN ALL CASES, 
BUT IN THIS CASE, MILITARY 
MIGHT IS MORE IMPORTANT THAN 
EVEN JOBS, BUT ALL OF THIS 
EQUIPMENT IS MADE RIGHT HERE IN 
THE U.S.A. 
AND IT'S THE BEST  EQUIPMENT ON 
EARTH, AND NOBODY MAKES IT LIKE 
WE DO. 
YOU HAVE $716 BILLION SO 
CONGRATULATIONS. 
AMERICA IS A PEACEFUL NATION 
BUT IF CONFLICT IS FORCED UPON 
US, WE WILL FIGHT AND WE WILL 
WIN, RIGHT, GENERAL? 
RIGHT? 
BETTER BELIEVE IT, GENERALS. 
THEY'RE THE GUYS. 
WE'RE POWERED BY THE 
UNSTOPPABLE FORCE OF THE UNITED 
STATES ARMY. 
VERY SPECIAL. 
WITH THIS NEW AUTHORIZATION, WE 
WILL INCREASE THE SIZE AND 
STRENGTH OF OUR MILITARY BY 
ADDING THOUSANDS OF NEW 
RECRUITS TO ACTIVE DUTY. 
RESERVE AND NATIONAL GUARD 
UNITS INCLUDING 4000 NEW ACTIVE 
DUTY SOLDIERS. 
AND WE WILL REPLACE AGING 
TANKS, AGING PLANES AND SHIPS 
WITH THE MOST ADVANCED AND 
LETHAL TECHNOLOGY EVER 
DEVELOPED AND HOPEFULLY WILL BE 
SO STRONG WE'LL NEVER HAVE TO 
USE IT BUT IF WE EVER DID, 
NOBODY HAS A CHANCE. 
IT ALL INCLUDES 135 BRAND NEW 
BEAUTIFUL M1 ABRAMS TANKS, 60 
BRADLY FIGHTING VEHICLES. 
AND OVER 3000 JOINT LIGHT 
TACTICAL VEHICLES FOR THE ARMY, 
ARMORED BRIGADE COMBAT TEAM. 
NEW BLACK HAWKS, 737F35 JOINT 
STRIKE FIGHTERS, YOU KNOW 
THAT'S STEALTH. 
I TALKED TO A COUPLE OF PILOTS, 
GREAT PILOTS, I SAID HOW ARE 
THEY. 
THEY SAID THEY'RE HARD TO BEAT 
BECAUSE YOU CAN'T SEE THEM. 
IT'S ALWAYS HARD TO BEAT THE 
ENEMY WHEN YOU CAN'T SEE IT. 
THE GREATEST IN THE WORLD. 
FULL FUNDING FOR THE B21 RAIDER 
BOMBER PROGRAM, 13 NEW BATTLE 
FORCE SHIPS, AND SUPPORT SHIPS 
INCLUDING A 4TH FORD CLASS 
AIRCRAFT AND THREE ADDITIONAL 
LATERAL COMBAT SHIPS. 
FUNDING TO MODERNIZE OUR 
NUCLEAR ARSENAL, SO IMPORTANT. 
WE'RE DOING A MAJOR UPGRADE OF 
OUR MISSILE DEFENSE. 
WE'RE SPENDING A TREMENDOUS 
AMOUNT OF MONEY ON OUR NUCLEAR 
ARSENAL. 
NOBODY WILL HAVE CLOSE. 
WE WILL HOPEFULLY NEVER EVER 
HAVE TO USE IT. 
BUT NOBODY WILL BE CLOSE. 
MORE THAN $11 BILLION FOR THE 
MILITARY CONSTRUCTION, 
INCLUDING FAMILY HOUSING AND WE 
ARE PROUDLY GIVING OUR TROOPS 
THE BIGGEST PAY INCREASE IN A 
DECADE, AND I KNOW YOU DON'T 
WANT IT BECAUSE YOU'RE VERY 
PATRIOTIC, YOU'LL SAY JUST SAVE 
THE MONEY, WE'RE GOING TO PAY 
DOWN DEBT. 
DOES ANYBODY NOT WANT IT, 
PLEASE RAISE YOUR HANDS. 
WHAT'S GOING ON HERE. 
ARE THESE REAL PATCH, I DON'T 
KNOW, GENERAL. 
I DON'T KNOW. 
IT'S THE BIGGEST INCREASE IN A 
DECADE. 
A STRONG MILITARY ALSO REQUIRES 
A STRONG ECONOMY AND OUR 
ECONOMY IS SETTING RECORDS LIKE 
NEVER BEFORE. 
WE HAVE THE GREATEST ECONOMY 
WE'VE EVER HAD. 
I THINK THAT'S GOING TO HELP IN 
A LOT OF WAYS. 
IT HELPS IN FUNDING AND DOING 
GREAT THINGS FOR THE MILITARY. 
WE HAVE CREATED 4 MILLION NEW 
JOBS SINCE THE ELECTION, A 
NUMBER THAT THE MEDIA IN THE 
BACK WOULD NEVER HAVE SAID 
WOULD BE POSSIBLE. 
IF DURING THE CAMPAIGN. 
I'M SO PROUD OF MYSELF, I 
DIDN'T CALL THEM THE FAKE NEWS 
MEDIA. 
I DIDN'T CALL THEM. 
I SAID TO MYSELF, I WILL NOT 
TODAY IN FRONT OF OUR GREAT 
ARMED FORCES CALL THEM FAKE 
NEWS. 
WE KNOW THE REAL TRUTH, BUT WE 
WON'T SAY IT TODAY. 
BUT THEY WOULDN'T HAVE BELIEVED 
IT POSSIBLE. 
4MILLION NEW JOBS, NOBODY WOULD 
HAVE THOUGHT THAT POSSIBLE ON 
THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL. 
IF WHEN WE WERE CAMPAIGNING, 
MIKE, IF I WOULD HAVE SAID 
THAT, IF I WOULD HAVE SAID 2 
MILLION NEW JOBS, PEOPLE WOULD 
HAVE LAUGHED US OFF THE STAGE, 
BUT WE HAVE 4 MILLION NEW JOBS. 
SOMETHING I'M VERY PROUD OF, 
THE AFRICAN-AMERICAN, HISPANIC 
AMERICAN, AND ASIAN ASIAN-
AMERICAN, THE UNEMPLOYMENT 
RATES FOR ALL THREE HAVE 
REACHED THE LOWEST LEVELS IN 
THE HISTORY OF OUR COUNTRY. 
UNEMPLOYMENT FOR AFRICAN-
AMERICANS, HISPANICS, ASIANS, 
THE LOWEST LEVEL IN THE HISTORY 
OF OUR COUNTRY. 
WOMEN'S UNEMPLOYMENT IS NOT, 
I'M SORRY, DOING QUITE AS WELL. 
IT'S ONLY THE LOWEST LEVEL IN 
65 YEARS. 
SO WE'RE NOT DOING AS WELL. 
BUT WE'LL DO BETTER. 
I THINK WITHIN ABOUT THREE 
WEEKS WHEN THE NEW NUMBERS COME 
OUT, YOU'LL PROBABLY BE LOWEST 
IN HISTORY ALSO. 
VERY IMPORTANTLY, THE VETERANS 
UNEMPLOYMENT RATE RECENTLY 
REACHED ITS LOWEST LEVEL IN 
NEARLY 20 YEARS. 
IT'S A BIG ONE. 
AND WE ARE CREATING 
MANUFACTURING JOBS AGAIN. 
REMEMBER DURING THE CAMPAIGN, 
THEY SAID, OH, YOU CAN'T CREATE 
MANUFACTURING JOBS. 
I SAID, REALLY? 
WE'RE NOT GOING TO MAKE THINGS 
ANYMORE. 
IS THAT WHAT IT'S COME TO? 
WE'RE GOING TO HAVE OTHER 
COUNTRIES MAKE THINGS AND WE'RE 
GOING TO BUY THEM, AND THEY'RE 
GOING TO HAVE THE JOBS AND 
WE'RE NOT. 
IT DOESN'T WORK THAT WAY. 
WE'RE DOING MANUFACTURING JOBS 
AT THE FASTEST PACE IN MANY 
MANY DECADES. 
NO LONGER ARE WE APOLOGIZING 
FOR AMERICA. 
INSTEAD, WE ARE NOW STANDING UP 
FOR AMERICA. 
IT'S CALLED AMERICA FIRST, IF 
THAT'S OKAY WITH YOU. 
WE'RE STANDING UP FOR OUR 
MILITARY AND WE'RE STANDING UP 
FOR OUR GREAT AMERICAN FLAG. 
WE'RE STANDING FOR OUR FLAG. 
THE ARMED FORCES HAVE ENDURED 
CONTINUOUS COMBAT. 
FOR THE PAST 17 YEARS, YET 
SINCE THE 1990s, THE NUMBER OF 
SOLDIERS ON ACTIVE DUTY WAS CUT 
BY MORE THAN ONE-THIRD. 
OUR BASES AND VITAL EQUIPMENT 
WERE ALLOWED TO FALL INTO A 
STATE OF DISREPAIR, AND I SAW 
SOME OF THEM, TOTAL DISREPAIR. 
BUT THOSE DAYS ARE OVER. 
EVERY DAY THE ARMY IS FIGHTING 
FOR US AND NOW WE ARE FIGHTING 
FOR YOU 100%. 
NO ONE BETTER UNDERSTANDS HOW 
STRETCHED OUR MILITARY HAS 
BECOME THAN THE SOLDIERS OF THE 
10TH MOUNTAIN DIVISION. 
IS THAT RIGHT, GENERAL? 
YOU WERE THE FIRST CONVENTIONAL 
COMBAT FORCE TO DEPLOY AFTER 
9/11. 
SINCE THEN, NO DIVISION IN THE 
ARMY HAS BEEN DEPLOYED MORE 
TIMES TO IRAQ AND AFGHANISTAN 
THAN YOU. 
YOU'VE SENT OVER 9000 
COURAGEOUS SOLDIERS TO 26 
DIFFERENT COUNTRIES, ALL AROUND 
THE WORLD IN THE PAST YEAR 
ALONE. 
THE SECOND BRIGADE COMBAT TEAM 
JUST RETURNED FROM A ROTATION 
AT THE JOINT READINESS TRAINING 
CENTER. 
AND LATER THIS YEAR, THEY WILL 
ONCE AGAIN BRAVELY ANSWER OUR 
NATION'S CALL AND DEPLOY TO 
AFGHANISTAN. 
THROUGH IT ALL, YOU HAVE PROVEN 
TO THE WORLD, TO OUR COUNTRY, 
TO YOUR FAMILIES, THAT FORT 
DRUM SOLDIERS AREN'T JUST 
TOUGH. 
YOU'RE MOUNTAIN TOUGH. 
THAT'S WHAT YOU ARE. 
YOU'RE MOUNTAIN TOUGH. 
I SAID TO YOU, GENERAL, WHAT'S 
THE DIFFERENCE. 
HE SAID, SIR, TRUST ME. 
THERE'S A DIFFERENCE. 
I SAID I TRUST YOU, RIGHT? 
I SAID DON'T GO INTO IT. 
I TRUST YOU. 
ONE OF THOSE SOLDIERS IS 
SPECIALIST BRADEN COOK, WHO WAS 
WITH US TODAY. 
WHERE'S BRADEN. 
OH, BRADEN, GOOD LOCATION, 
BRADEN. 
LAST OCTOBER HIS TEAM CAME 
UNDER HEAVY FIRE WHILE CLEANING 
AND CLEARING OUT TALIBAN 
STRONGHOLDS IN VARIOUS 
LOCATIONS IN AFGHANISTAN. 
AND AN AFGHAN SOLDIER FIGHTING 
ALONGSIDE U.S. TROOPS WAS BADLY 
WOUNDED WHEN AN EXPLOSIVE 
DETONATED NEARBY. 
SPECIALIST COOK BRAVED THE HAIL 
OF BULLETS AND MORTAR ROUNDS 
ALL OVER. 
THEY SAID IT WAS ALL OVER. 
IT WAS HEAVY FIRE. 
SAVING THE LIFE OF THAT WOUNDED 
SOLDIER AND EARNING A BRONZE 
STAR FOR VALOR FOR HIS 
COURAGEOUS ACTION. 
BRADEN, I WANT TO THANK YOU. 
BRAVE YOUNG MAN. 
THANK YOU, PLEASE STAND UP 
AGAIN, BRADEN. 
WE'RE ALSO INSPIRED BY THE 
DEVOTION TO DUTY SHOWN BY THE 
FAMILY MEMBERS WHO SERVED THEIR 
NATION HERE AT HOME. 
ASHLEY SHEPHERD IS ONE OF THOSE 
FAMILY MEMBERS. 
SHE HAS BEEN MARRIED TO 
SERGEANT FIRST CLASS IAN 
SHEPHERD FOR MORE THAN 14 
YEARS. 
ASHLEY SUPPORTS MILITARY 
FAMILIES IN EVERY WAY YOU CAN 
IMAGINE. 
SHE HAS SERVED AS A FAMILY 
READINESS GROUP LEADER,
COLEADER, TREASURE, AND 
ASSISTANT TREASURER FOR THREE 
COMPANIES. 
SHE WORKS HARD. 
SHE RAISES MONEY FOR 
SCHOLARSHIPS, ORGANIZES CHARITY 
EVENTS FOR GOLD STAR FAMILIES, 
AND FEEDS HOMELESS VETERANS. 
ASHLEY, I WANT TO THANK YOU. 
ASHLEY, WHERE IS ASHLEY. 
I HAD A FEELING THAT WAS YOU, 
ASHLEY. 
STAND UP, ASHLEY. 
THANK YOUR HUSBAND, TOO. 
THANK YOU. 
AMERICA IS ETERNALLY GRATEFUL 
FOR EVERY SOLDIER, RECEIVES 
MEMBER AND FAMILY MEMBER HERE 
AT FORT DRUM AND WE ARE FOREVER 
IN THE DEBT OF EVERY AMERICAN 
WHO HAS EVER SERVED OUR NATION 
IN UNIFORM. 
FROM THIS NOSE OF VALLEY FORGE, 
TO THE JUNGLES OF VIETNAM, AND 
THE MOUNTAINS OF AFGHANISTAN, 
IT'S JUST INCREDIBLE WHAT YOU 
DO. 
A FEW DAYS AGO, VICE PRESIDENT 
PENCE FLEW TO HAWAII TO GREET 
THE REMAINS OF SOME OF OUR 
NATION'S GREATEST HEROES, OUR 
FALLEN WARRIORS WHO GAVE THEIR 
LIVES MANY YEARS AGO IN KOREA. 
NOW THESE AMERICAN HEROES ARE 
FINALLY STARTING TO COME HOME. 
THEY WILL BE LAID TO REST ON 
AMERICAN SOIL. 
WE BELIEVE IN NO AMERICAN LEFT 
BEHIND. 
AND WE BELIEVE OUR WAR FIGHTERS 
DESERVE THE TOOLS, THE 
EQUIPMENT, AND RESOURCES THEY 
HAVE EARNED WITH THEIR BLOOD, 
SWEAT AND TEARS. 
IN A FEW MOMENTS IN HONOR OF 
THAT SACRED OBLIGATION, I WILL 
PUT MY SIGNATURE ON THE 
NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION 
ACT. 
THIS AUTHORIZATION WILL GIVE 
AMERICAS WAR FIGHTERS, THE FIRE 
POWER THEY NEED TO WIN ANY 
CONFLICT QUICKLY AND 
DECISIVELY. 
THANKS TO THE LEADERSHIP OF 
REPRESENTATIVE STEFANIK, WE ARE 
MAKING AN UNPRECEDENTED 
COMMITMENT TO DEVELOPING OUR 
ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE 
CAPABILITIES. 
IN ORDER TO MAINTAIN AMERICA'S 
MILITARY SUPREMACY, WE MUST 
ALWAYS BE ON THE CUTTING EDGE. 
THAT IS WHY WE ARE ALSO PROUDLY 
EASSERTING AMERICA'S LEGACY 
LEADERSHIP IN SPACE. 
OUR FOREIGN COMPETITORS AND 
ADVERSARIES HAVE ALREADY BEGUN 
WEAPONIZING SPACE, DEVELOPING 
NEW TECHNOLOGIES FOR 
SATELLITES, YOU LOOK AT WHAT 
THEY ARE DOING. 
THEY HAVE GIVEN ME RUN DOWNS, I 
HAVE SEEN THINGS THAT YOU DON'T 
EVEN WANT TO SEE WHAT THEY ARE 
DOING AND HOW ADVANCED THEY 
ARE. 
WE'LL BE CATCHING THEM VERY 
SHORTLY. 
THEY WANT TO JAM TRANSMISSIONS, 
WHICH THREATEN OUR BATTLEFIELD 
OPERATIONS AND SO MANY OTHER 
THINGS. 
WE WILL BE SO FAR AHEAD OF THEM 
IN A VERY SHORT PERIOD OF TIME, 
YOUR HEAD WILL SPIN. 
CHINA EVEN LAUNCHED A NEW 
MILITARY DIVISION TO OVERSEE IT 
WAR FIGHTING PROGRAMS IN SPACE. 
JUST LIKE THE AIR, THE LAND, 
THE SEA, SPACE HAS BECOME A WAR 
FIGHTING DOMAIN. 
IT IS NOT ENOUGH TO MERELY HAVE 
AN AMERICAN PRESENCE IN SPACE. 
WE MUST HAVE AMERICAN DOMINANCE 
IN SPACE. 
AND THAT IS WHY JUST A FEW DAYS 
AGO THE VICE PRESIDENT OUTLINED 
MY ADMINISTRATION'S PLAN TO 
CREATE A 6TH BRANCH OF THE 
UNITED STATES MILITARY CALLED 
THE UNITED STATES SPACE FORCE. 
GOT TO GET IT, JOE. 
RIGHT, JOE? 
RIGHT? 
WE WILL ENSURE THAT THE NEXT 
GREAT CHAPTER IN HISTORY IS 
WRITTEN BY THE HEROES OF THE 
UNITED STATES MILITARY. 
AMERICA WILL ALWAYS RISE TO 
EVERY CHALLENGE, AND OVERCOME 
EVERY DANGER BECAUSE WE ARE 
BACKED BY THE STRENGTH AND 
POWER OF THE AMERICAN SOLDIER. 
SPEAKING TO HIS TROOPS, GENERAL 
GEORGE PATTON, A GREAT ONE, 
ONCE SAID WE HAVE THE FINEST 
EQUIPMENT AND THE BEST SPIRIT, 
AND THE BEST MEN IN THE WORLD. 
NOW, IF IT WERE TODAY, HE WOULD 
BE SAYING THE BEST MEN AND 
WOMEN IN THE WORLD. 
THINGS DO CHANGE, BUT THAT WAS 
QUITE A STATEMENT MANY YEARS 
AGO. 
CONTINUING HIS REMARKS, PATTON 
THEN DECLARED, I DON'T WANT TO 
GET ANY MESSAGES SAYING I AM 
HOLDING MY POSITION. 
WE ARE NOT HOLDING A DAMN 
THING. 
WE ARE ADVANCING CON CANTILY. 
-- CONSTANTLY. 
THAT WAS PATTON. 
NEARLY 75 YEARS LATER, PATTON'S 
WORDS STILL RING TRUE. 
AMERICA HAS THE BEST EQUIPMENT 
ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD. 
WE HAVE THE BEST SPIRIT, THE 
BEST SOLDIERS EVER TO SET FOOT 
ON ANY BATTLEFIELD ANYWHERE AT 
ANY TIME. 
WE ARE THE MOST POWERFUL. 
WE ARE THE BEST FUNDED. 
WE ARE THE BIGGEST. 
WE ARE THE STRONGEST, WE ARE 
THE SMARTEST. 
AND WE ARE STILL NOT HOLDING A 
DAM THING BECAUSE AMERICA IS ON 
THE MOVE ONCE AGAIN, AND WE ARE 
NOT BACKING DOWN. 
OUR COUNTRY IS RESPECTED AGAIN. 
I DON'T KNOW IF YOU SEE IT. 
BUT AMERICA IS RESPECTED AGAIN. 
IT IS A BIG DIFFERENCE AND A 
BIG DIFFERENCE IN THE AIR. 
YOU TAKE A LOOK AROUND. 
THERE'S A BIG, BEAUTIFUL 
DIFFERENCE. 
WE ARE ADVANCING FORWARD WITH 
OUR CONFIDENCE RENEWED, OUR 
MIGHT RESTORED, AND THE 
UNWAVERING CONVICTION THAT OUR 
DESTINY IS CERTAIN. 
EACH OF YOU IS MOUNTAIN TOUGH, 
MOUNTAIN PROUD AND MOUNTAIN 
STRONG AND ALWAYS WILL BE 
CLIMBING TO GLORY. 
YOU WILL BE CLIMBING TO GLORY. 
THANK YOU AGAIN FOR THE 
INCREDIBLE MEN AND WOMEN OF 
FORT DRUM. 
SPECIAL, SPECIAL, GREAT PEOPLE. 
GOD BLESS OUR TROOPS, AND GOD 
BLESS THE UNITED STATES OF 
AMERICA. 
I'D NOW LIKE TO INVITE A FEW OF 
OUR FANTASTIC SOLDIERS FROM THE 
TENTH MOUNTAIN DIVISION, SECOND 
BRIGADE COMBAT TEAM TO JOIN ME 
ON STAGE TO SIGN THE NATIONAL 
DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION ACT. 
IT'S BEEN AN HONOR TO BE WITH 
YOU TODAY. 
THANK YOU ALL VERY MUCH. 
THANK YOU. 
THAT'S GOOD, RIGHT? 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH, EVERYBODY. 
GREAT HONOR. 
THANK YOU. 
 
>>> AND WE WERE JUST LISTENING 
TO PRESIDENT TRUMP DURING HIS 
FIRST VISIT TO UPSTATE NEW YORK 
SINCE TAKING OFFICE. 
HE IS THERE AT FORT DRUM. 
HE ANNOUNCED THE NATIONAL 
DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION ACT. 
WE JUST SAW HIM SIGNING IT 
THERE A MOMENT AGO. 
IT IS OFFICIALLY KNOWN AS THE 
JOHN S. McCAIN NATIONAL DEFENSE 
AUTHORIZATION ACT BUT THE 
PRESIDENT NEVER ONCE MENTIONED 
SENATOR McCAIN'S NAME AND HIS 
REMARKS. 
NOW, THIS NATIONAL DEFENSE 
MEASURE WILL PROVIDE MORE THAN 
$700 BILLION IN FUNDING FOR THE 
MILITARY. 
IT WILL INCREASE SERVICE 
MEMBERS' SALARIES BY NEARLY 3% 
PERCENT, WHICH IS THE LARGEST 
PAY HIKE IN NINE YEARS. 
THE BILL ALSO AUTHORIZES A 
MILITARY PARADE THAT MR. TRUMP 
WANTS TO HOLD IN WASHINGTON 
THIS NOVEMBER. 
IT'S WORTH MENTIONING THAT OF 
COURSE THE PRESIDENT IS ALSO IN 
UPSTATE NEW YORK FOR A 
FUNDRAISER FOR GOP 
REPRESENTATIVE CLAUDIA TENNY, 
WHO IS FACING A VERY TOUGH RACE 
IN HER DISTRICT. 
FORT DRUM ITSELF, HOWEVER, IS 
IN THE DISTRICT OF YET ANOTHER 
REPUBLICAN REPRESENTATIVE ELISE 
WHO DID SPEAK FOR A FEW MOMENTS 
TODAY BEFORE THE PRESIDENT GAVE 
HIS ADDRESS, AND SHE IS 
REPORTEDLY THE PERSON WHO 
INVITED THE PRESIDENT TO FORT 
DRUM, AND YOU CAN SEE THERE IS 
VICE PRESIDENT MIKE PENCE. 
HE WAS ALSO IN ATTENDANCE AND 
SPOKE BEFORE THE PRESIDENT. 
IT IS, AGAIN, INTERESTING THAT 
THE PRESIDENT DID NOT MENTION 
SENATOR JOHN McCAIN ONCE. 
IT IS OBVIOUSLY WIDELY KNOWN 
THAT THE TWO HAVE FEUDED IN THE 
PAST. 
HOWEVER, THAT IS SOMETHING THAT 
WASHINGTON OBSERVERS WILL NOTE. 
ONCE AGAIN , THIS NATIONAL 
DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION ACT WILL 
PROVIDE MORE THAN $700 BILLION 
IN FUNDING FOR THE MILITARY AND 
GIVE SERVICE MEMBERS A SALARY 
BUMP OF ALMOST 3%, SOMETHING 
I'M SURE THEY ARE ALL VERY 
HAPPY ABOUT. 
ALL RIGHT. 
WE'RE GOING TO TAKE A QUICK 
BREAK. 
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK WITH MORE 
CBSN. 
DON'T GO AWAY.
