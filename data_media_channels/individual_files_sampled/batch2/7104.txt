TYT is partnering with participant media to help solve the climate crisis will not be great now look you got to check out our series 10 days of action to learn more about what you can do to make a difference and go see an inconvenient sequel truth to power in theaters in New York and LA on July 28th and nationwide August 4th twenty five people in a rural village in Pakistan have been arrested due to their ruling in a case involving a teenage girls rape so earlier this month the council told a 20 year old man to rape a 16 year old girl after this 20 year olds family accused the girl's brother of raping his 12 year old sister okay and so it's a hideous story from the get-go from the very beginning and instead of carrying out justice against the individual who allegedly raped a twelve-year-old girl they decided to victimize a completely innocent person okay so they've victimized the 16 year old girl and keep in mind that members of this council who made this ruling were present during the time of the rape which is disgusting okay but but but honestly I think that I think that's why they did it because this is not justice they wanted to get off on it and so it look guys it is that simple a lot of times so how many times the people use religion and culture to do things that they wanted to do anyway and so you'll have Muslim fundamentalists in in Afghanistan somehow justify having sex with young boys which is definitely supposed to be against their religion and they'll find a religious excuse for you'll find shia in iran who will say oh no we could do temporary marriages so you go get marry that hooker for an hour and then you come back and wait as long as you pay the mullah okay and and then you saw a scandal in the Catholic Church no no this is what God wanted and gold you'll damage the church don't you complain about it as all those priests are raping all those kids and so sexually we're asking them and molesting them and do all those terrible things and in this case those guys they it's not like they're like oh we're so worried about justice you didn't have to watch it why'd you watch it right yeah why would you victimize an innocent sixteen year old girl if her brother was accused of doing something wrong why don't you go after her brother and why is it that he's not the person who should face any consequences whatsoever it's okay in fact you retaliate by victimizing the 16 year old girl it's disgusting now look this is again a rural part of Pakistan and there are laws in Pakistan against this which is why this council got arrested for their ruling and what they did to the sixteen-year-old girl so those arrested included 24 of the village councils 27 members and also the fifteen-year-old boy accused of setting off the chain of events after being accused of raping the younger girl so you know that was the 15 year old boy who allegedly raped the 12 year old girl and that's what kind of led to this chain of events it's amazing that they didn't punish him like the council it didn't even cross their minds why because the guilty party must be the woman even though she's the victim right and how are we going to address the female victim by victimizing another female because god forbid you should ever punish men and so look I know that people say well I don't know it's part of their culture that's right well that part of the culture sucks it's hideous it's barbaric and you know what you need to do you need to change it so if I've hurt your feelings because you think it makes sense the rape innocent girls for the crimes of someone else in their family okay then I hurt your feelings okay but I can assure you that your crime is way worse than mine so I do believe in the cultural Wars I think culture is monumentally important so culture is sometimes influenced by religion sometimes it's influenced by geography certainly influenced by socio-economic and political events and it creates and it's and boy is it affected by the media right so now these guys are not getting a lot of media they're stuck in the stone Age's man and so that's a combination of what they've been doing in there for thousands of years plus the religion coming in right so but I don't so what because you used to do something doesn't make it right and this is what I can't get through conservatives heads whether they're in Pakistan are here which no a tradition heritage I know what slavery was a tradition it was a terrible tradition it was our culture it was a terrible part of our culture in Central Asia they kidnapped women and raped them and the and then they say okay now you have to marry me because I raped you and her parents come over and convinced her that she needs to marry her rapist yep so now it was came from a nomadic culture where you were going you would do raids and you would literally rape and pillage so I understand the genesis of the culture it doesn't make it right I understand that was your heritage not everything in your heritage is positive so we have to be open to change wherever you are in the world in this particular case so Pakistan's government did the right thing here because this is how you begin to get to change right which is no we're not going to allow you to do that I don't care how much you tell me it's your culture or your religion it is illegal and you have to stop it so beyond that issue do education programs and if you say well that's just indoctrination yes we indoctrinate people to eat with a fork and knife and spoon that's a fine indoctrination we need to indoctrinate people to be decent to one another and and indoctrinating people not to commit senseless rape against girls who did nothing wrong is that wonderful indoctrination is much better than the indoctrination they're doing right now at the local level where they're saying we should do it yes sometimes your culture is wrong so I know that's an uncomfortable fact but this is an easy one and we we should all work together in all the different parts of the world to fight for progress and change when we need it
