a standing ovation for the player who took a stand when the national anthem was played before games began in 2016 Colin Kaepernick started kneeling in protest when he was quarterback for the San Francisco 49ers how can you stand for the national anthem of a nation that preaches and propagates freedom and justice for all there's so unjust to so many of the people living there how can you not be in a rage when you know that you're always at risk of death in the streets or enslavement in the prison system how can you willingly be blind to the truth of systemic racialized injustice a former teammate was with Kaepernick as he received Amnesty International's ambassador of conscience award it's ironic that the stand Colin and I took wasn't to stand at all but it was to take a knee Colin didn't kneel and process of a song or symbolic piece of fabric but he'd note to bring awareness to the human rights still being denied to people of color he didn't kneel because he is anti America but he believes that America should be held to the standard that it has written on paper that we are all created equal Catholics form of protest wasn't popular with everyone it was viewed as unpatriotic by US President Donald Trump he urged team owners to fire players who copied Kaepernick he's following in famous footsteps with this award previous recipients include anti-apartheid campaigner and former South African president the late Nelson Mandela but just like the ambassador of conscience award winners before him Kaepernick chose to speak out despite the risks an expectation for him not to do that his commitment to the movement is all the more remarkable because of the professional cost to him and the alarming levels of ritual is that it has attracted from those in power 30 wrote Kaepernick remains out of a job he hasn't played in the NFL since opting out of his contract with the 49ers a year ago but he continues to be a role more for some youngsters inspiring a new generation such as these school children and Amsterdam to keep taking a stand Kevin Calvert al-jazeera
