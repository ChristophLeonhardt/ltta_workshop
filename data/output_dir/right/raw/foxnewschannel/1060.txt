EXCITEMENT AND WAS ALWAYS VERY

48
00:01:35,270 --> 00:01:35,970
SUPPORTIVE OF YOUR CAREER AND

CHASE DOWN A GOOD STORY.

51
00:01:37,272 --> 00:01:38,907

CREEPY, I FELT LIKE I WAS PART

54
00:01:42,377 --> 00:01:43,678

55
00:01:43,678 --> 00:01:45,680
YOU IMAGINE THESE GUYS ARE

56
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:46,347
SINISTER, TURNS OUT THEY'RE

57
00:01:46,347 --> 00:01:47,482
MOSTLY JUST PATHETIC.

58
00:01:47,482 --> 00:01:49,984
THERE ARE TOO.

59
00:01:49,984 --> 00:01:57,358
IF THE RUSSIA HOAX DIDN'T EXIST,

60
00:01:57,358 --> 00:01:58,760
CORRUPT BUREAUCRATS WHEN TO BE

61
00:01:58,760 --> 00:01:59,694
MISUSING THEIR POWER WHICH THEY

62
00:01:59,694 --> 00:01:59,961
ARE.

63
00:01:59,961 --> 00:02:00,962
IT'S HARD TO FEEL TOO MUCH

64
00:02:00,962 --> 00:02:04,499
SYMPATHY FOR THIS GUY.

65
00:02:04,499 --> 00:02:06,901
THE FEDS ARE ONCE AGAIN

66
00:02:06,901 --> 00:02:07,902
PROSECUTING SOMEBODY WHOSE SOLE

67
00:02:07,902 --> 00:02:09,503
ALLEGED CRIME IS LYING TO THE

68
00:02:09,503 --> 00:02:09,871
FEDS.

69
00:02:09,871 --> 00:02:11,473
IT WOULD BE NICE IF OUR

70
00:02:11,473 --> 00:02:12,707
GOVERNMENT WENT AFTER PEOPLE FOR

71
00:02:12,707 --> 00:02:13,942
REAL CRIMES, IT MIGHT MAKE YOU

72
00:02:13,942 --> 00:02:17,479
FEEL BETTER ABOUT THE SYSTEM.

73
00:02:17,479 --> 00:02:19,280
THE DOJ ALSO SEIZED PHONE AND

74
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:20,882
EMAIL RECORDS FROM A REPORTER

75
00:02:20,882 --> 00:02:22,484
ABOUT THIS CASE AND BROKE INTO

76
00:02:22,484 --> 00:02:23,885
THE ENCRYPTED TEXT EXCHANGES, I

77
00:02:23,885 --> 00:02:25,653
DIDN'T KNOW THAT WAS POSSIBLE

78
00:02:25,653 --> 00:02:27,088
TURNS OUT IT IS.

79
00:02:27,088 --> 00:02:28,757
IT LOOKS A LOT LIKE WHAT THE

80
00:02:28,757 --> 00:02:29,891
OBAMA PEOPLE USED TO DO.

81
00:02:29,891 --> 00:02:31,392
IT WAS WORRISOME THEN AND IT'S

82
00:02:31,392 --> 00:02:33,495
WORRISOME NOW, WHEN THE

83
00:02:33,495 --> 00:02:34,329
GOVERNMENT SPIES ON AMERICAN

84
00:02:34,329 --> 00:02:37,298
CITIZENS IT IS ALWAYS A BIG DEAL

85
00:02:37,298 --> 00:02:38,733
WHETHER THOSE CITIZENS ARE

86
00:02:38,733 --> 00:02:39,434
"NEW YORK TIMES" REPORTERS OR

87
00:02:39,434 --> 00:02:40,135
TRUMPED CAMPAIGN STAFFERS IT

88
00:02:40,135 --> 00:02:41,536
DOESN'T MATTER.

89
00:02:41,536 --> 00:02:43,471
THERE HAD BETTER BE A VERY GOOD

90
00:02:43,471 --> 00:02:47,075
REASON FOR SPYING ON AMERICANS.

91
00:02:47,075 --> 00:02:47,809
THE MEDIA DON'T RECOGNIZE THIS

92
00:02:47,809 --> 00:02:50,612
THEY ONLY CARE IF SOMEONE SHARES

93
00:02:50,612 --> 00:02:51,079
THEIR POLITICS.

94
00:02:51,079 --> 00:02:54,482
AS FAR AS THEY ARE CONCERNED

95
00:02:54,482 --> 00:02:55,250
CONSERVATIVES WHO ARE WIRETAPPED

96
00:02:55,250 --> 00:02:58,686
BECAUSE THEY ARE CONSERVATIVE.

97
00:02:58,686 --> 00:02:59,354
THE PRESS WOULDN'T KNOW A

US.

105
00:03:13,468 --> 00:03:14,302
HOW DOES THIS WOLF CHARACTER FIT

106
00:03:14,302 --> 00:03:17,872
INTO THE LARGER STORY?

107
00:03:17,872 --> 00:03:20,642
>> THE NAME OF CARTER PAGE, HE

108

WAS RELATIVELY ANONYMOUS IN THIS

109

SCHEME.

110
00:03:24,078 --> 00:03:25,146
CARTER PAGE HAD ASSISTED THE FBI

111
00:03:25,146 --> 00:03:27,782
IN A PRIOR CASE WHERE THEY

112
00:03:27,782 --> 00:03:33,354
LOCKED UP A RUSSIAN SPY, THE

113
00:03:33,354 --> 00:03:35,089
NAME WAS RELATIVELY UNKNOWN AT

114
00:03:35,089 --> 00:03:35,790
THAT POINT.

115
00:03:35,790 --> 00:03:36,758
WOLFE IS THE ONE WHO LEAKS THE

STORY.

119
00:03:44,699 --> 00:03:46,267
THIS IS WHERE IT GETS UGLY.

120
00:03:46,267 --> 00:03:50,972
THIS IS WHY THE PRESS HAS ZERO

121
00:03:51,105 --> 00:03:54,876
THAT STORY BY WATKINS IS CITED

122
00:03:54,876 --> 00:03:55,877
REPEATEDLY TO ADVANCE THE MEDIA

123
00:03:55,877 --> 00:03:59,447
PROPAGANDA STORY THAT TRUMP IS

BECAUSE CARTER PAGE NOW THAT

128
00:04:05,687 --> 00:04:07,789
THIS WAS USED OVER AND OVER

AGAIN.

130
00:04:09,924 --> 00:04:11,025

00:04:42,056 --> 00:04:44,192
REMEMBER THAT WHEN A PAID

154
00:04:51,766 --> 00:04:55,336
DOING ITS DUTY.

155
00:04:55,336 --> 00:05:00,575

ERIC SWALWELL THE CONGRESSMAN

157
00:05:02,543 --> 00:05:03,945
FROM CALIFORNIA WHEN YOU

158
00:05:03,945 --> 00:05:04,612
MENTIONED A SPYING HE SAID

159
00:05:04,612 --> 00:05:07,081
SOMETHING THAT WAS TRUE TO YOU.

160
00:05:07,081 --> 00:05:08,716
HE'S NOT HERE TO DEFEND HIMSELF

161
00:05:08,716 --> 00:05:10,318
BUT HE SAID WE ONLY SPY ON THE

162
00:05:10,318 --> 00:05:13,054
BAD GUYS, HE WAS RIGHT!

163
00:05:13,054 --> 00:05:15,423
TRUMP WAS THE ENEMY, THIS IS THE

164
00:05:15,423 --> 00:05:18,660
NEW LIBERAL POLICE MIND-SET.

165
00:05:18,660 --> 00:05:20,962
TRUMP IS THE ENEMY, NOT THE

166
00:05:20,962 --> 00:05:23,197
CHINESE, NOT THE RUSSIANS THE

167
00:05:23,197 --> 00:05:25,266
REAL ENEMY WAS DONALD TRUMP.

168
00:05:25,266 --> 00:05:27,268
HE WAS ABSOLUTELY RIGHT, THIS IS

169
00:05:27,268 --> 00:05:29,070
THE NEW LIBERAL MIND-SET, HE IS

170
00:05:29,070 --> 00:05:30,471
THE BAD GUY.

171
00:05:30,471 --> 00:05:32,073
AS LONG AS YOU'RE SPYING ON

172
00:05:32,073 --> 00:05:32,807
CONSERVATIVES IT'S OKAY AND WE

173
00:05:32,807 --> 00:05:36,477
WILL PLAY THE EUPHEMISM.

174
00:05:36,477 --> 00:05:38,780
HE WAS AN INFORMANT, HE WAS A

175
00:05:38,780 --> 00:05:40,481
SPY AND EVERYBODY KNOWS THAT.

PEOPLE WERE ACCUSED OF THINGS

180
00:05:50,058 --> 00:05:51,025
BUT NOW THE ACCUSATION IS ITSELF

181
00:05:51,025 --> 00:05:53,795
CONSIDERED PROOF OF GUILT.

182
00:05:53,795 --> 00:05:57,465
WHEN DID THAT HAPPEN?

183
00:05:57,465 --> 00:05:59,200

191
00:06:15,917 --> 00:06:17,819
NOBODY HAS PROVIDED A SCINTILLA

192
00:06:17,819 --> 00:06:19,087
OF EVIDENCE THAT THERE WAS

193
00:06:19,087 --> 00:06:20,722
PROBABLE CAUSE OF THE TWO THINGS

194
00:06:20,722 --> 00:06:22,857
THEY NEEDED TO SPY ON CARTER

195
00:06:22,857 --> 00:06:24,859
PAGE.

196
00:06:24,859 --> 00:06:26,894
SECONDLY IN VIOLATION OF U.S.

197
00:06:26,894 --> 00:06:27,962
LAW, NOBODY HAS SHOWN THAT

198
00:06:27,962 --> 00:06:30,665
CARTER PAGE IS OUTDOING CABLE

199
00:06:30,665 --> 00:06:31,399
INTERVIEWS PROBABLY TONIGHT

200
00:06:31,399 --> 00:06:31,766
SOMEWHERE.

201
00:06:31,766 --> 00:06:37,271
THIS IS NONSENSE.

202
00:06:37,271 --> 00:06:38,339
>> Tucker: IF CARTER PAGE WAS

203
00:06:38,339 --> 00:06:40,808
GUILTY, WHY HASN'T HE BEEN

204
00:06:40,808 --> 00:06:42,477
CHARGED?

205
00:06:42,477 --> 00:06:43,244
HIS BEHAVIOR WAS THE PRETEXT FOR

206
00:06:43,244 --> 00:06:46,481
THIS ENTIRE STORY, DOES IT TELL

207
00:06:46,481 --> 00:06:47,181
YOU SOMETHING THAT HE HASN'T

208
00:06:47,181 --> 00:06:51,219
BEEN CREDIBLY ACCUSED OF A CRIME

209
00:06:51,219 --> 00:06:51,753
BEEN CREDIBLY ACCUSED OF A CRIM

210
00:06:51,753 --> 00:06:52,253
CRIME?

211
00:06:52,253 --> 00:06:54,088
>> THE FBI AND DEPARTMENT OF

212
00:06:54,088 --> 00:06:56,057
JUSTICE WALKED INTO A FOREIGN

213
00:06:56,057 --> 00:06:58,192
INTELLIGENCE SURVEILLANCE COURT,

214
00:06:58,192 --> 00:07:00,228
USED EFFECTIVELY THE STAR

215
00:07:00,228 --> 00:07:01,696
CHAMBER, USED TO PROSECUTE THE

216
00:07:01,696 --> 00:07:03,865
WORST AMONG US, THE WORKS OF

217
00:07:03,865 --> 00:07:04,899
SAVAGES ON THE PLANET.

218
00:07:04,899 --> 00:07:06,200
THEY BRING CARTER PAGE IN THERE

219
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:08,936
TO SPY ON HIM AND YOU'RE RIGHT,

220
00:07:08,936 --> 00:07:10,938
HE'S OUT WALKING AROUND RIGHT

221
00:07:10,938 --> 00:07:12,106
NOW.

222
00:07:12,106 --> 00:07:12,874
THE FBI ISN'T INTERVIEWING HIM,

223
00:07:12,874 --> 00:07:15,476
I KNOW OF NO CONTROLS ON HIS

224
00:07:15,476 --> 00:07:16,477
BEHAVIOR AT ALL.

225
00:07:16,477 --> 00:07:18,546
THE ANSWER IS BECAUSE THERE

226
00:07:18,546 --> 00:07:20,081
PROBABLY IS NO INDICATION OF

227
00:07:20,081 --> 00:07:21,382
CRIMINAL BEHAVIOR AT ALL AND

228
00:07:21,382 --> 00:07:22,150
THEY DESPERATELY WANT THAT ANGLE

229
00:07:22,150 --> 00:07:24,652
OF HIM TO GO AWAY.

230
00:07:24,652 --> 00:07:25,820
>> Tucker: ONCE YOU TALK TO

231
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:26,554
CARTER PAGE YOU REALIZE HOW SAD

232
00:07:26,554 --> 00:07:28,856
THIS WHOLE THING IS.

233
00:07:28,856 --> 00:00:00,000
HE WAS NEVER A RUSSIAN AGENT OR
