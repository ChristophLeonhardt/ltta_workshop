LIVE IT FOR HER. I'M JOINED BY MEADOW POLLACK'S DAD, ANDREW POLLACK. I'M SO EMOTIONAL WATCHING YOUR DAUGHTER'S FRIENDS, I CAN ONLY IMAGINE WHAT IT'S LIKE FOR YOU, ANDREW. I CAN'T TELL YOU HOW ANGRY AND UPSET I AM TODAY. I'M HAVING A ROUGH DAY WITH THIS GRADUATION THAT'S GOING TO GO ON TOMORROW. I WASN'T PREPARED TO HEAR ALL THAT STUFF ABOUT MY DAUGHTER. I'M ANGRY WITH ALL THIS INCOMPETENCE THAT MY DAUGHTER'S NOT GETTING HER DIPLOMA TOMORROW. IT'S MY SON THAT HAS TO GET IT ON THAT STAGE. SO IT'S TOUGH. I CAN IMAGINE. YOU KNOW, WE ALL JUST GIVE YOU SO MUCH CREDIT FOR HOW STRONG YOU'VE BEEN. OBVIOUSLY IT'S GOING TO BE A VERY HARD DAY. YOU LISTENED TO HER FRIENDS, WHO I'M SURE THEY'RE GREAT KIDS. REALLY GREAT KIDS. EVERYBODY IS PROUD OF THEM. YOUR DAUGHTER SHOULD BE ON THAT STAGE. YEAH. THE STORY THAT I MENTIONED ON THE WAY IN HERE, ABOUT THE PARAMEDICS, YOU KNOW, I TALKED TO GOVERNOR RICK SCOTT YESTERDAY, OR THE DAY BEFORE, ABOUT WHAT'S BEING DONE IN FLORIDA TO MAKE SURE THIS NEVER HAPPENS AGAIN. THERE'S LEGISLATION THAT YOU WORKED VERY HARD TO PASS, BUT, YOU KNOW, YOU HAVE TO ASK YOURSELF, WHAT HAPPENED AT THE BROWARD SHERIFF'S OFFICE WHEN THEY'RE NOT LETTING THE PARAMEDICS IN, AND NOW WE KNOW THAT THAT GUY WAS OUT OF THE BUILDING SOME TIME BEFORE THAT, RIGHT? YEAH. WELL, THEY COULDN'T LET THEM IN BECAUSE THEY THOUGHT THAT YOU KNOW, THE ONE DEPUTY THAT WORKED AT THE SCHOOL DIDN'T GO IN. SO HE HID BEHIND THE WALL, AND THEY THOUGHT THAT THERE STILL WAS AN ACTIVE SHOOTER IN THERE BECAUSE HE WAS STILL HIDING BEHIND THE WALL, THE DEPUTY THAT WAS AT THE BUILDING AT THE TIME. SO, YOU KNOW, THE PARAMEDICS, THEY HAD THEIR WORK CUT OUT FOR THEM THAT DAY BECAUSE THE SHERIFF AT THE SCHOOL DIDN'T DO HIS JOB. AND A LOT OF OTHER PEOPLE DIDN'T DO THEIR JOBS EITHER, MARTHA. THEY HAVE MONITORS AT THAT SCHOOL. AN ARTICLE CAME OUT TODAY ABOUT A MONITOR THAT WORKS AT THAT SCHOOL THAT DIDN'T DO HIS JOB EITHER. HE SAW A GENTLEMAN, WALK OUT OF A CAR, ON TO THE SCHOOL GROUNDS, WITH A RIFLE BAG, AND DIDN'T CALL A CODE RED OR CALL THE POLICE. HE DIDN'T CALL THE POLICE AFTER HE HEARD GUNSHOTS. JUST ANOTHER LEVEL OF INCOMPETENCE AT THAT SCHOOL. THAT GENTLEMAN STILL WORKS AT THE SCHOOL, AND HAS HIS JOB. YOU'RE KIDDING? IT WAS UPSETTING SEEING THAT ARTICLE. YEAH. HE'S STILL AT THE SCHOOL. NO ACCOUNTABILITY FOR NOT CALLING THE POLICE. JUST GETTING ON A RADIO. AFTER HEARING GUNSHOTS. IF YOU READ THE ARTICLE THAT CAME OUT TODAY, IT IS UNREAL, AND IT'S UPSETTING. WOW. UNREAL. EVERY DAY THERE'S ANOTHER ARTICLE COMING OUT. THERE'S A VIDEO GAME. THEN THERE'S A VIDEO ON THE PHONE. SO, YOU KNOW, ALL THE FAMILIES, EVERY DAY THEY'RE RELIVING SOMETHING NEW. THIS WEEKEND IT HAPPENS TO BE GRADUATION. SO SORRY. YOU KNOW, THERE WAS A MOMENT AT THE WHITE HOUSE, I KNOW YOU WENT TO THAT FIRST GATHERING RIGHT AFTER THE SHOOTING, AND YOU WERE SO STRONG, STANDING THERE WITH YOUR SONS, TALKING TO PRESIDENT TRUMP. HERE'S WHAT HAPPENED AT THE WHITE HOUSE PRESS BRIEFING THIS WEEK. MENTAL HEALTH IS MORE ABOUT THE FACT THAT WE COULD GET SHOT AT SCHOOL. SPECIFICALLY CAN YOU TELL ME WHAT THE ADMINISTRATION HAS DONE AND WILL DO TO PREVENT THESE SENSELESS TRAGEDIES? I THINK THAT AS A KID, AND CERTAINLY AS A PARENT, THERE IS NOTHING THAT COULD BE MORE TERRIFYING FOR A KID TO GO TO SCHOOL AND NOT FEEL SAFE. I'M SORRY THAT YOU FEEL THAT WAY. THIS ADMINISTRATION TAKES IT SERIOUSLY. AND THE SCHOOL SAFETY COMMISSION THAT THE PRESIDENT CONVENED IS MEETING THIS WEEK. YOU CAN HEAR HER GET EMOTIONAL WHEN SHE RESPONDED TO THAT LITTLE CHILD. I'M JUST CURIOUS WHAT YOU THINK ABOUT HOW THE WHITE HOUSE IS DOING ON WHAT YOU WERE PROMISED SO FAR? WELL, I CAN TELL YOU THIS, THE PRESIDENT DID LISTEN, AND HE PUT A COMMISSION TOGETHER. BUT TALK IS CHEAP RIGHT NOW IN THIS COUNTRY. I'M TIRED OF HEARING TALK. I'M TIRED OF ROUNDTABLES. WE NEED METAL DETECTORS AND ARMED GUARDS AT THE SCHOOL. IT DOESN'T TAKE A ROCKET SCIENTIST TO FIGURE OUT THAT ANY KID COULD WALK INTO A SCHOOL ANY DAY OF THE WEEK WITH A WEAPON, A KNIFE, A HATCHET, A GUN HOW ARE OUR KIDS SAFE WITHOUT METAL DETECTORS AND SINGLE ENTRY SO THAT'S WHAT WE NEED, MARTHA. I LAID IT OUT ON MY PLAN, AMERICANSFORCLASS.ORG. WE URGE EVERYBODY TO GO THERE. WE WANT TO CONTINUE TO BE HELPFUL IN ANY WAY WE CAN. ANDREW, THANK YOU. WE'LL BE THINKING YOU ABOUT THIS WEEKEND.
