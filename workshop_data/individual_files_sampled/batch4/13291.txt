with the midterms fast approaching Democrats are searching for new ways to convince voters to reject Republican peace and prosperity in favor of hysterical panic the Democrats have been testing out new campaign slogans like sure you have a job now but Trump called a point store harsh horseface and yes you can't afford a vacation this year but look there's a crying Mexican baby Democrat spokesman Kenny Navis told reporters quote we feel we have a secret weapon this year in Donald Trump who's rude Boris insulting and doing an absolutely spectacular job as president of the United States of course we're hoping people will overlook that last part unquote navour's says if he can get voters to concentrate on Trump's personal failings he should be able to make them give up the excellent economy rationale foreign policy and dedication to the rule of law that has marked this administration after that they hope to get people to give up their iPhones because Steve Jobs was a jerk give up their cars because Henry Ford was a bigot and tear up the Constitution because Thomas Jefferson slept with one of his slaves in a memo to his staff spokesman Davis wrote quote if we can convince Americans to judge people by their flaws instead of their accomplishments we will ultimately find ourselves without prosperity technology and freedom then we'll have reached peak leftism unquote Democrat insiders say their strategy is meant to appeal mostly to women who are overly emotional easy to frighten and immune to reason once they get upset of course that's only true of left-wing women and of course it's also true of left-wing men so maybe the whole man woman thing is not the point here as neighbors said in a pep talk to his campaign workers quote the country is doing great but we're not in power so let's get out there and spread some hysteria so people will make the mistake of voting for us unquote and come to think of it that statement might make a good Democrat campaign

a couple we got Michael Duran coming on from the Hudson Hudson Institute he wrote a great piece in The New York Post over the weekend about who he is how we should react to his obviously being murdered by the crown prince of Saudi Arabia now they're lying about it they're saying he died in a fight he was fighting it's like a 59 year old journalist fighting against a teen like hired killers but they're saying he died in a fight Trump is ticked off everybody's ticked off but Duran had oh just a great piece on it we'll talk to Knowles about political politican I have to say the one thing I really like about Politico is they actually have right wingers and left wingers there it's not one of these events this has become all right wing all the time so you have like you know both sides coming together for civilized intellectual discourse like this moment this is you know beautiful exchange between Charlie Kirk and Chang Unger every single day what do I do 30 every single year can we all just get along no we can't not gonna things are getting intense because we're reaching the midterms and the thing about the midterms as the midterms approach it is the right way to read the news right way to look at events that everything is being constructed and placed as a campaign issue so the big story you you're hearing about or not hearing about if you're watching the mainstream media is this caravan this invasion of people coming up from Honduras and now Mexicans are joining as well they broke through the Mexican lines they regathered they say by there's something like they started out four thousand now maybe seven thousand they say may get it up as high as ten thousand Trump is saying he's gonna cut off aid to Central American countries he's saying he's gonna send the army down which he's completely within his rights to do they defend our border and of course it's gonna they're gonna get here just in time for the midterms right and and we know as they get here and I'm not usually suspicious about stuff like this but in this case I think you have to be as we get to the midterms suddenly you know they're not gonna have enough food cuz obviously somebody's paying for this obviously somebody hoarding them along the way we're gonna start to see this quite you haven't heard a word from the Democrats Democrats haven't said really anything but soon you're gonna have the crying baby pictures oh the babies you know and all this stuff and look yeah III don't believe I don't believe that we should just like spit on these people or say you know this is a you know I believe this troll first of all they are carrying they coming out of Honduras and they say they're escaping and they're carrying Honduran flags so what the hell you know I mean if you're carrying an American flag maybe at least we think you want to be in the country but they you know there's just something it's just very very very suspicious to me and you know we start to hear about the humanitarian crisis of it all and we'll start to hear you know what terrible people we are but really really we cannot take in everybody what you know it's it's a problem because if we stop them we don't want anybody to get killed we don't want there to be violence but if we just let them in what happens next Caravan the next day the next day they start building another Caravan you cannot have that happen we've seen Europe inundated with with people like that we've seen Angela Merkel basically selling the identity of Europe away to make herself look kind or make yourself feel kind we cannot do it we're gonna have to stop we're gonna have to make sure and the Democrats think this is their campaign issue but Trump knows it's his Trump knows it says and see that this is the thing you know the New York Times around a thing saying a headline last week and it said Republicans are finding it illegal immigration a surprisingly potent campaign issue that were you at the last election did you own a television I mean of course it's a potent campaign issue and it's not about the races of the people that's garbage it's not about not being that kind and open country we love immigrants this country lives off immigrants we know that this is non immigration this is invasion it's illegal and you cannot say the people you cannot say to the people of this country oh you elected us to pass laws but our laws don't matter if we can have crying babies on TV and win elections that's that's basically what they're saying cannot happen our laws count our laws matter and of course this is the other thing that Trump knows is a great great issue that he knows the Cavanaugh hysteria all the people chasing people out of restaurants the screaming and the yelling they get rid of due process the believe all women nonsense and of course it's nonsense you don't believe all anybody everybody gets to process Trump is selling this big time he knows that people are seeing this on TV and the press can tell you it's not mob rule as much as they want it's mob rule so he's out there you know really selling it he's got it he says his new hashtag this is cup number six the Democrat Party has become an angry ruthless unhinged mob determined to get power by any means necessary your vote in this election will decide which party controls Congress the choice for every American could not be more clear so Democrats produce mobs Republicans produced jobs that's become that's called hashtag that's a new hashtag that's a hard one this November vote for jobs not mobs if Nancy Pelosi crying Chuck Schumer and the radical Democrats take over Congress which would be a shame they will try to plunge our country into a nightmare of gridlock poverty and chaos so the left knows the Democrats know this is a problem for them they know they push too hard they know they went too far hating Trump is not a campaign issue it may be a campaign issue for certain groups for some people but ultimately ultimately people care about how they live especially in congressional races where you're voting for your local guy so they want to turn this you know whatever they do they want to turn it around and throw it at Trump and Trump made a comment at one of his rallies where he was talking about this thing happened it happened they may 2:17 2017 where remember that Guardian reporter asked the Montana Republican congressional candidate Greg GM Forte I think and he body slammed her he knocked him down allegedly so Trump made a joke about that here's the joke by the way never wrestle him any guy that can do a body slam he's my kinda imitating the body's like alright listen I've compass hilarious but I'm not going to approve the violent rhetoric laws but the people there obviously they don't want to bodyslam reporters they just telling you they hate reporters because reporters lie is a way and in a graphic way of the people telling the reporters you lie we hate you you hate us 50 years we've listened to you tell us we stink 50 years we've learned we've listened to you skew the news we hate you that's what the messages but of course journalists don't like that's for some reason I don't know what it is the journalists are on and you know who's really unhappy is Jim look at me I'm Jim Acosta is unhappy about this because Jim is such a you know he's such a restrained person he never attacks he never attacks ordinary Americans he never skews the news to Donald Trump and he you know he's so he's trying to turn it around to make it sound like Trump people are the violent ones here is Jim look at me I'm Jim Acosta the president made that joke about Guardian Forte assaulting Ben Jacobs I looked over to the crowd there was one gentleman a trump supporter in the crowd who was doing pro wrestling moves doing body slam tight gestures in the crowd so the crowd was obviously eating this stuff up and people wonder whether or not there's a cause of affect whether or not the president's rhetoric you know plants seeds of violence is and its own supporters in his own crowds I think it was pretty evident there that that the crowd was loving every minute of this when the president was talking about assaulting joking about assaulting reporters at this rally tonight it is a ream light rant but the problem they have is when the violence happens they keep telling us how violent we are but when the violence happens surprise it's always from the left it's just about always from the left you don't have right-wingers going shooting congressmen while they're playing softball it's always from the left Mitch McConnell cocaine Mitch can have a simple glass of cocaine at his local diner without somebody screaming at him here's yet another the third time this has happened what's beautiful here if you're not watching is the people in the restaurant just tell this guy to get out and they're not all Republicans they're just Americans they're just Americans and that's a beautiful thing right and the left has lost though is gonna lose those people one hopes once they see what what is going on and you know I mean I I think that's a great thing that they throw him out so you say the other day Pelosi got mobbed and that's true Pelosi also got mobbed the other day but you can show that what's the difference between that there is no difference except for this everybody on the right denounced that every single person Ted Cruz all the spokespeople I was on a column of Politico on a panel with Politico no Dan Bungie no he's at one of the you know he's a really good guy really nice guy I'd never met him before terrific person but one of those red meat guys he just was ready he's got the language he what's the smack out he said this is stupid I don't want this stuff on our side I want this on their side we've all denounced it do they denounce it on the left let's listen to Nancy Pelosi talking and you've heard a little bit of this quote before but you haven't heard the whole thing listen to this we owe the American people to be there for them for the for their financial security respecting the dignity and worth of every person in our country and if there's some collateral damage for some others who do not share our view well so be it but it shouldn't be our original purpose so so we want to have dignity for every American except for those who don't share our views except for they they get so that's the difference the difference is their leadership is supporting this you know what you need when you need software advice you need software

advice.com slash Clavin to connect with an advisor for free software advice.com slash Clavin first question you ask him he spelled Clavin there's pay la vie aan you know I want to get back to this thing about about the way they talk about us and the way we talk about them but we have Michael Durant on the phone and I want to talk to him about the Khashoggi it thing because one of the things they're doing with Trump is blaming him for the killing of Khashoggi speaks nastily about reporters and therefore the fact that a guy writes columns for the Washington Post was murdered by the Saudis is somehow Trump's fault Michael Durant is a senior fellow at the Hudson Institute specializes in Middle East security issues he was part of the George W Bush administration serving in the White House as a senior director in the National Security Council wrote a great great piece in the New York Post this weekend thing was Friday hey you know it Mike's good to see it great good to see you it's a pleasure let's start with this because we're hearing a lot of stuff from both sides who who was Khashoggi exactly what you know where do we place him on the spectrum of idea people well the news media wants to just say he's a journalist and a dissident democracy advocate right and there's there's some truth to that but that's it's a half truth the the fact that matter is he's first and foremost a regime insider he was very close for many years to Prince Turki al-faisal who was a head of intelligence for for a very long time later he was connected to all will lead you know Alwaleed he's one of the richest guys in the world so we're not talking about a guy who's simply a man of ideas to the extent that he has a commitment to ideas he's in the mold of the Muslim Brotherhood yeah he's a an Islamist and when he's talking to his American colleagues allies he can say you know I want to open up the Arab regimes so that the voices of the people can be heard and that's a to open it up for a political Islam okay that's yeah and when when when Prince Mohammed bin Salman and they soon they call NBS this is the crown prince he's now the strongman in Saudi Arabia he he moved against political Islam and Ashok she went into into exile and came to the United States and that that's who he is so this is so we're dealing with the usual thing that we either have to back the strongmen or we have to back this murderous Islamist philosophy I mean is that pretty much where we're stuck I am a little bit of a squish I don't want to lose all of your viewers I'm a little bit of a but I'm a little bit of a squish on the Islamists of the Ashok G orientation that there if the Middle East ever did democratize the Arab world that democratize then political Islam of one flavor or another is going to be part of the bargain and I think my view it's a fact of life and I but but we are we are we do I think have really pretty stark choices and we got a lot from NBS that we were very happy with you know women driving the new relationship with Israel his outreach to the Iraqi government which is a Shiite government and most important at all of all I think from a strategic point of view is that he shifted Saudi policy to get it 100% behind Trump's policy in Syria which led which led to a significant like then between Saudi Arabia and Turkey soon as Turkey doesn't like our policy there so why did MBS f-secure I seems pretty obvious that he killed this guy why did why did he have to kill him well there's the threat for him for NBS is kind of a four-part threat he represents Islamism that he's moved against he represents the Qatari Turkish axis and you remember that NBS also broke very very dramatically with Qatar and accused them of actually plotting assassinations and getting involved in the internal affairs of Saudi Arabia and then he also has like I said these connections to the regime to the to the to the royal family opposition to the Prince so he's sort of I would say the ideological face of the royal opposition at NBS and then to make it worse he got he got a perch in Washington DC where he started working with the with the American elite critics of NBS these are the former Obama people who want to move toward Iran and away from Saudi Arabia and he was undermining I mean to put it simply he was undermining mvs in Washington where it matters most so is it fair to say that some of the voices calling for us to essentially blow up our relationship with Saudi Arabia our Obama X Obama people who want to bring back this Iran elite alliance which seemed just correct me if I'm wrong the Iran alliance seemed like a crazy idea to me I mean it seemed like an idea on paper I could understand the Shia you know divided and all this but it just seemed like nuts to Ally ourselves with them it's its strategic genius like if you put all of the coordinates into a computer like computer dating you know decide oh yeah Iran that's the country that we're gonna align with that's the way that's the way I read it and now you have to one has to admit that there is I think a level of genuine outrage obviously what what NBS did was crude and thuggish and immoral and eerie you can add whatever adjective you want on there and there are I think people in in Congress like Lindsey Graham who actually feel that they had been led down the garden path Allah but because they've been defending him against his critics and he turned around and and behaved like this but if you want to ask why is the media 24/7 yeah talking about this like this is the biggest issue in the world I mean we've got a million people in concentration camps and we Gers and concentration camps in China and we don't hear a word about it and this one guy this one guy is you know 24/7 that's I think two things one they want they feel that they can make the direct connection between the White House and the palace in Riyadh and so they can they can lay it on Trump's doorstep and then number two exactly what you said this is an effort to to justify and rehabilitate the Obama foreign policy okay that's that's a really good point I the my last question what you do it's kind of like The Maltese Falcon when a guy gets killed you have to do something about it what what should trump do what's the his best move here well he there has to be a public face I mean but he the United States cannot be so closely tied to a country like Saudi Arabia and and and have behavior like this and if nothing else forget about the morality for a second I'm it's a tremendous embarrassment to the president right before the the midterm elections I mean it's a you know the old thing about it's it's worse than a crime it's a blunder obviously it's a boat but for me I mean I have a very simple view of these things and and and and of international relations and that it the first question you have to ask is who are your friends and who are your enemies and you don't treat your friends the way you treat your enemies and so it's like a family member if you're fan if a family member does something bad you take him you shut the door behind closed doors you you you give them a very strong talking to you but you don't go undermining them in public because they are your family but if you under find them you're undermining yourself then we have to ask ourself at this region we have to get we have to grim up with the look at how many trillion dollars did we spend in Iraq and after all of that we do not have a proxy in Iraq Iraq pool or Iraq belongs as much to Iran now as it does the United States Vladimir Putin spent a fraction of that in Syria and Vladimir Putin has a proxy on the ground and Vladimir Putin is the guy that's dictating what happens according to his to his lights much more than we are yeah and that that's because he understands in his fingertips this very basic logic that you protect your friends and you punish your enemies once you do that then your your morals and everything else then they can come into play but if your if your your friends don't trust you or if we're going to treat our friends worse than we treat our enemies our influence is going to dissipate and for good and for I mean our good influence our values our influence is going to dissipate as well I think as simple as could be its sorry it's so simple I was just gonna say it's so simple when you have a little common sense Michael Duran senior fellow at the Hudson Institute the piece in the what and the New York Post is called why the Saudis despised jamala Khashoggi thanks a lot Mike that was really clarifying I appreciate it thank you good thank you too you know this is one of the other things that's becoming I started out by talking about how everything becomes a campaign issue this close to the this close to the elections the if you you may have heard about this transgender thing where Trump administration is going to say you know define gender as what's what gender you are that's what they're gonna do if you you know if you have one compare if you have one kind of sexual organs when you come out of your mom you're one thing and if you have another you're the other thing and everybody oh my gosh the shock in the New York Times one one editor at The New York Times tweeted this is Wow you're just gonna try and define these people out of existence you know this issue why do you think this issue is coming up now because everybody in the country knows a boy is a boy and a girl was a girl and now silly the New York Times looks when they play this how silly the left look they know it's a good issue to me though to me the really important thing is when they're trying to pin all this stuff on Trump they're not really pinning it on Trump they're pinning it on you you know after that thing with the body slamming and all this again you know I don't like that kind I don't like violent rhetoric but he was just getting playing off the crowds hatred of the are dishonest press Joe Scarborough comes on and listen to what he says not about Trump not about Trump but about the people the people who voted for Trump and the people who were gathered in that auditorium let's say last week with Donald Trump praised the assault of a reporter who was beaten up and thrown to the ground for simply asking a question about health care reform the audience behind Donald Trump is cheering and laughing and apply I just wanted who raised them first of all who raised those people that are cheering and laughing when a president applauded somebody being beaten up and battered a reporter for asking a question about health care apparently again forgetting what happened to Khashoggi in Saudi Arabia who raised them what church did they go to growing up they still go to church every week do they go to church on Sundays and then Mondays they applaud somebody beating up the press we're asking you a question about health care reform what do they tell their children at night about the type of character they wanted to have Cece you can't cheer about somebody committing assault and battery and beating up somebody and throwing them to the ground mm-hmm you can't cheer on lies that you know to be lies and then go home and try to teach your child anything see you stink it's you it's you stinking if you don't think that that is the left in general the intellectual left in general there is a great column in The Wall Street Journal today by David grill enter the computer guy at Harvard I don't always agree with him but this is is actually terrific school the real reason they hate Trump I want to read a chunk of this he starts out by saying every big us election is interesting but the coming midterms are fascinating for a reason most commentators forget to mention the Democrats have no issues the economy's booming America's international position is strong in foreign affairs the US has remembered in the nick of time what Machiavelli advised princes five centuries ago don't seek to be loved seek to be fear that contrasts with the Obama years must be painful for any honest leftist for future generations that Cavanagh fight will stand as a marker of the Democratic Party's intellectual bankruptcy the flashing red light on the dashboard that says empty the left is beaten their only issue is we hate Trump and he says this is an instructive hatred because of what what the Left hates about Donald Trump is precisely what it hates about America the leftist I know hate Trump's vulgarity his unwillingness to walk away from a fight his bluntness his certainty that America is exceptional his mistrust of intellectuals his love of simple ideas that work and his refusal to believe that men and women are interchangeable worst of all he has no ideology except getting the job done his goals are to do the task before him not be pushed around and otherwise to enjoy life in short he is a typical American except exaggerated because he has no constraints because he's rich he doesn't have any constraints to cramp his style they hate America they hate you they hate that they really do and that is one of the best campaign issues ever because why would you elect somebody who hates you how is he gonna serve you if he hates you why would anybody vote for someone who hates the core of the country even on the coasts why would you it's insane hey listen do not miss the next chapter of my story another Kingdom performed by the lovely and talented Michael Knowles today subscribers get exclusive access to

on Fox and Friends at 4:00 in the morning because then you know when I'm out with you the night before I speak in cursive on TV but what I met with you last night we get to catch up on política and all the craziness of yes that's true it was it was kind of crazy I got to say and we got to celebrate another Kingdom is doing well it's doing great I know it's a great story no I'm not shocked because of that I knew this story was great because season one did very well yeah and now this this one is even cooler I mean obviously all of the sets and the art and everything is cooler but even the story is so hard charging it's actually different than the first season yeah it actually gives you something quite different the character changes the story advances it's really really cool so I'm pleased that it's it's doing that well I'm just shocked that Hollywood and big technology haven't shut us down is it is kind of amazing they they don't know what we're doing yet so I think I think listen I this is this is the revolution this is I consider myself in my age I consider myself the Ben Franklin of the Cultural Revolution you know I'm old I doze off from time to time but I'm still something and I do women in France probably have a lot of stories to tell them I don't know I mean I think this is an important stuff and I think people are getting it and it's just a good story I'm ministers and you're doing a great job so that's the nicest thing I'm gonna say about Yanks yeah jeez this is great you you did a lot more than me at politican I had a really fun we all did a panel together we use a daily wire panel and I had a fun panel with Ann Coulter and Dan bungee know which way and and Kane the wrestler came who's now a mayor so he was I think when you're sitting with bungee know is ripped and Kane is the size of a building like I felt I felt a little bit like I was hoping Ann Coulter would protect me of anything that is true and can just a mental examiner I with her stare you know I gotta tell you one story before you saw it and and I went out for drinks afterwards and we walk out and there two guys two security guys are walking with her and every you know n is the sweetest human being on earth and yeah like cheese everybody loves her and of course the guys are just fall at her feet and we get out and they one of the security guards is telling her that he's a singer you know he's trying to be as LA everybody wants to be something he wants to be a singer and she said really and he starts singing a love song to her and he's great I mean he was just terrific and we're standing outside of the LA what's the name of that building there convention the convention center and this security guard is singing to Ann Coulter this love song and it was it was a great it was just great it was a great moment what were your panels you got on some good ones though so they threw me on these left wing panels you got to hang out with Ann Coulter that sounds great you know they threw me on these left wing panels and in my one right wing panel they made me wear a dress so we did you were very fetching that it was the sexy Handmaid's Tale costume I don't know what was sexy about it but that's what they told ya so they had me on these two other panels with lefties the first one was how the bleep do we all get along and that was fun a couple right-wingers as they were charlie kirk and roaming millennial and then there were these left-wing guys Kyle kolinsky who's a YouTube guy and Bakari sellers who's the one who said that Kanye West is what happens when Negroes don't read books sell CNN yeah so you know it's skewed a little bit they were they were certainly on the left and then I was on this other comedy panel with a bunch of I don't know how I made it onto that panel being a non comedian I think it's cuz I wrote a not a blank book you know it is kind of strange I mean Michael Loftus who was an actual comedy writer really he was in the house you know and he they and of course Crowder could have come I don't know if he was unavailable but like what they put you on a loan with they know they had roaming millennial was there too but she's so nice you know yeah I'm not nice so they had me on these panels and you know I was I was pretty amazed because I found that some conservatives tried to be really conciliatory yeah they tried say oh well we agree with this and that and you know yeah we can let prisoners out of jail and yeah we can you know they're kind of trying to fine middle-ground in certain libertarian areas I'm not interested in ya conciliation I'm not interested in that at all the right is finally winning and I see no reason to give any credence to these left wingers who are saying oh look we're just trying to get along hey guys go storm Mitch McConnell's house hey guys assault them in the street we're just trying they're not trying to get along and and we have this big advantage that our policies work yes right we might let my folks were lifelong Democrats but after Giuliani came in and cleaned up New York they they voted for they they thought oh my gosh the streets are safe the business is booming everything's going great they voted for his reelection of course they did because people aren't stupid they see what works and our policies actually work that's right and we finally got the left on the ropes I mean they've got their policies are indefensible yeah where they have policies at all and so far it seems to just amount to hashtags and slogans and abolish law enforcement or something so we've got them on the ropes on policy we've got them on the ropes electorally they should be killing it in this election that'll be a blue wave and it doesn't look to be a blue wave from the polling so we should double down here because the other thing I found is one those lefty guys can get pretty vicious yeah how did they treat you well you know the one guy I kind of liked is John Fugelsang yes this guy is an actor and a left-winger and he was making some of the stupidest arguments I've ever heard but at least he was sort of polite and nice and fine some of them were vicious I mean this one guy is named Sklar or something I guess he's a youtuber comedian he immediately the minute he couldn't refute what I was saying he just called me a racist really me of course and his Ann Coulter famously told me in high school when when when a liberal calls you a racist you know you've won the argue and they couldn't answer anything they were just all they could go off of were these little cheap talking points that change now every day this guy Sklar in the comedy panel started attacking Donald Trump over Saudi Arabia over having business interests in Saudi Arabia I said how much money did the Saudi government give to Hillary Clinton he couldn't answer yeah I don't know yeah they don't they don't really seem to know very don't know very much I've noticed this too you know like I've said this fruit for years our smart our smart guys are smarter they're smart guys a lot I mean when you read the New York Times op-ed page you are not reading intellectual material but when you read The Wall Street Journal op-ed page you are I mean it's that is a big difference and is it not only also our smart women are prettier and our pretty women are smarter that's it my twitter bio is so true and insightful it you know in the the thing with these other guys is they were making shallow arguments that's fine and then you would refute the shallow argument but you know it takes a little bit of knowledge in context to know when you've been refuted yes it just actually see that you know all shallows are clear yeah quote dr. Johnson and I found these guys didn't even have that or they were just unwilling to even entertain the possibility of you know a point that they hadn't considered before and then the third problem was as you know from our panel the microphones that were roughing you couldn't hear each other yeah I was really that was really bad I don't think people realize that you know it's very hard I mean the thing is when the four of us get together Jeremy and Ben and you and me we tend to like gabble at each other and kit around it was very hard to do because you couldn't hear with the other and Alicia was there as well and he it was like very hard to do because you couldn't hear what anybody else was saying yeah what was your take I mean what you got to be on the nice panels what's your takeaway I mean you know it was very funny to be sitting between Ann and Dan you know they're both they're both very very tough characters I thought I was between Tube buzzsaws you know and I was just fitting putting in my two cents from time to tell you did you speak at all on that no I actually did occasionally but I but I I will say that it was a little you know I don't I don't go out much you know I keep to myself and you know I hang out with you guys but mostly they thought it was a little shocking to me to see some of these people in person I mean one great thing was I bumped into Tucker Crossland I'd never met him face to face with lovely what a nice right but then you see Michael avenatti walking and I and I swear my visceral reaction my gut reaction was wait shouldn't he be in prison I saw Jennifer Rubin I thought where the white guys with the white coats you know like yeah I thought all these people that you talk about on the air and some of which I some of whom I just feel it really are I don't know not very high level you mean you met examples of humanity walking around free I wasn't sure I'm not sure how I feel about you walking around one fair enough yeah by the way by the way you're you're referring to our future president Michael I can I show some respect GPL what is Tucker going creepy porn Lloyd creepy porn lawyer enterprise all right what's on your show today so today we're gonna be talking about my strategy on the cold Civil War actually a little bit what we're talking about here on the attack on because a lot of conservatives want to be conciliatory oh I like this I like that ya know my strategy for the cold civil war is simple we win and you lose and we'll analyze it in races around the country that's that is a great subject absolutely I will turn it in everyone else should too Noel's good to see you leave I'm sick of you now but I'm so happy all right our crappy culture so I got a wax a little philosophical here so I came in I want to come into this early because I wanted to talk a little bit about something this Democratic congresswoman Kyrsten Sinema who is running to replace Senator Jeff Flake in Arizona and Arizona seems to be trending blue so maybe she's going to do it she has a tendency to stick her foot in her mouth and they unearthed a 2006 interview where she cursed out stay-at-home moms and she said these women who act like staying at home leeching off their husbands or boyfriends and just cashing the checks is some sort of feminism because they're choosing to live that life that's BS I mean what the f are we really talking about here so this is a disgusting obviously and IIIi tweeted out you know that my wife I stayed at home rows are raised our kids she took care of me you know she made a home for us and and for me she still takes care of me and but always bothers me about this is is that it exposes the underlying philosophy of the left and the underlying philosophy of socialism and communism which is materialism the idea that there is nothing to you but a bag of flesh and there's nothing to life but how much money you make and who where the money is coming from and who is paying for things there and it always bothers me when people say things like Oh a homemaker who should be making $90,000 a year there is no amount of money zero amount of money that you could pay that you could give me that would be worth what my wife did in our family we all worship there's three of us we other besides her we worship the ground she walks on she knows it we make her aware of it because there's it when I see no amount of money I mean it's priceless it is priceless because it is not a material occupation when I've completely admit that one of the problems modern women have is that home industries were taken away from them by the Industrial Revolution that's being reversed by the internet now women can have industries at home which is great so they can stay home and also have some economic clout but the thing that a homemaker does is not material it is not material it is the single most important thing that people do it is the single most important thing that people do and the fact is that maybe our culture under rates it under values it possibly because of feminism and and money can't market you know I mean I never understand married couples who have joy separate bank accounts I've never understood that to me you're a family you're a unit all the money goes into a pool you know I couldn't have done the stuff that I did if Ellen hadn't done that but more than that I would never have a person like me an artist a guy who says every word that comes out you know every word that comes into his head comes out of my mouth a guy who's really not fit - doesn't have a real place in the corporate world doesn't have her I would have had nowhere to be I frequently joke that without my wife I'd be living in a dumpster but without my wife every place I lived would be a dumpster you know and I don't just mean you know cleaning things up though that to who I admit but but I mean also just like you know making making a place for people in the world children need that and men need it too I mean I needed it too and it just it's just infuriates me I want to talk about this more as the week goes on I'm reading a lot of this kind of new moral experimentation they're doing where they give people ethical questions and then they how they how they react or whether they react out of their emotions or whether they react out of logic and you know it is developing new ideas you know we have the slogan here that Ben came up with facts don't care about your feelings but of course facts and feelings are very very much interwoven and I feel that they are doing this research like jonathon hate is the guy I think he's kind of a classical liberal which makes him on the right now makes him a right winger now they're doing this research where the materialist assumption is in place they just assume that there is nothing to us but flesh and bones and there's nothing to morality but practicality and logic and those things aren't true and so when I hear somebody tearing down moms and homemakers who I think are the centerpiece of the world I think all of civilization was built to protect and keep them in to keep them protected and fed and supported so they can do the essential work that they do when I hear that happening I just hear that materialist bandwagon and I think is infesting the right as well as the left and we really have to talk about it because all of this stuff that they say is based on materialism everything that they say when they talk about equality when they talk about unfairness when they talk about women they're always talking about materialist assumptions and they are not the only assumptions we can make that comment about homemakers was disgusting it was degrading one of the most important most essential maybe the essential thing that people do all right we will be back tomorrow and I'll continue ranting on so even after they turn off the mic I'll keep her ante now still be here tomorrow you will come in mid
