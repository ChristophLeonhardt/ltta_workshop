now traveling internationally of course can be exhausting traveling domestically can be exhausted to the schedule can be full but the full schedule often means it is often the most interesting work we do and obviously when you're traveling on vacation it's a different sort of experience but I love that too I've got lots of tricks I don't I never check a bag I I still read paper which is an unusual thing now some of the news I get on my tablet but an awful lot of the books I read that I like to read a lot I'll carry paper so I've got a full briefcase a you know a wheelie but a soft soft sided leather bag that I carry as my suitcase whether I'm gone for a week or two almost never check a bag I have different routines around sleep on flights depending on where I'm going so if I'm going to Europe which is typically an overnight flight I'll have a bite to eat that I immediately will go to sleep when I go to Asia which is a much longer flight typically you're landing at nighttime in Asia and so I stopped trying to stay awake a full 13 or 14 hour flight over so that by the time I get there I'm exhausted enough to get a great night's sleep the first night exercise is hugely important and particularly when you travel and so I will hit the gym or if I if possible if it's an American I can run outside I'll get outside running is what I do because it's what I've always done but it's also quickest you need the least gear for it I have some sort of weird features I love first to open all the curtains in the hotel room when I walk in including that night including in the cities I think getting the natural light to work which is where when you're on a different time zone is really important get immediately on that schedule as opposed to give into the exhaustion and sleep during the day because then you're you'll never get there so those are those are the quick tricks that come to mind
