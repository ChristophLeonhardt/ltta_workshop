1
00:00:00,734 --> 00:00:01,801
DID JUST LIKE THE DEPARTMENT OF

2
00:00:01,801 --> 00:00:03,069
HOMELAND SECURITY DID FOR

3
00:00:03,069 --> 00:00:03,403
OTHERS.

4
00:00:03,403 --> 00:00:06,540
>> GOOD TO SEE YOU BOTH.

5
00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:08,041
THANK YOU FOR JOINING US

6
00:00:08,041 --> 00:00:08,642
TONIGHT.

7
00:00:08,642 --> 00:00:12,846
HERE NOW THE AFOREMENTIONED

8
00:00:12,846 --> 00:00:13,847
ANDREW McCARTHY.

9
00:00:13,847 --> 00:00:14,714
GOOD TO SEE YOU.

10
00:00:14,714 --> 00:00:16,315
YOU WROTE AN INTERESTING LENGTHY

11
00:00:16,315 --> 00:00:18,084
PIECE THAT GOES INTO THIS

12
00:00:18,084 --> 00:00:18,451
TIMELINE.

13
00:00:18,451 --> 00:00:21,555
YOU KNOW, FOR ME, BECAUSE THIS

14
00:00:21,555 --> 00:00:23,290
STUFF GETS CONFUSING, BUT ONE OF

15
00:00:23,290 --> 00:00:24,090
THE QUESTIONS I HAVE IS WHETHER

16
00:00:24,090 --> 00:00:26,026
OR NOT THE CHICKEN OR THE EGG

17
00:00:26,026 --> 00:00:37,470
CAME FIRST, BECAUSE WAS THERE A

18
00:00:43,843 --> 00:00:43,977
CAME FIRST, BECAUSE WAS THERE A

19
00:00:43,977 --> 00:00:44,578
REASON TO INVESTIGATE.

20
00:00:44,578 --> 00:00:44,611
>>

21
00:00:46,379 --> 00:00:48,448
ONCE YOU HAVE INFORMANTS IN,

22
00:00:48,448 --> 00:00:49,449
THAT PEOPLE HAVE BEEN ENTRAPPED.

23
00:00:49,449 --> 00:00:51,284
YOU DO HAVE TO WONDER, BECAUSE

24
00:00:51,284 --> 00:00:54,387
IT COMES DOWN, IN EVERY CASE

25
00:00:54,387 --> 00:00:56,556
WHERE THERE'S AN INFORMANT,

26
00:00:56,556 --> 00:00:57,791
WHERE PEOPLE PREDISPOSSESSED TO

27
00:00:57,791 --> 00:01:03,997
DO THINGS OR

28
00:01:10,036 --> 00:01:11,204
LOW-HANGING FRUIT IN THIS 14

29
00:01:11,204 --> 00:01:12,372
POLICY TEAM, WE'VE RAISED

30
00:01:12,372 --> 00:01:15,108
QUESTION, SO WHY DON'T YOU OFFER

31
00:01:15,108 --> 00:01:16,242
THEM ON DIRT ON HILLARY CLINTON

32
00:01:16,242 --> 00:01:21,247
AND SEE WHAT HAPPENS.

33
00:01:21,247 --> 00:01:32,092
>> PEOPLE ASK ALL

34
00:01:40,734 --> 00:01:42,168
HAVE A INSTITUTIONAL NORM WHERE

35
00:01:42,168 --> 00:01:44,304
HE DON'T, IN LAW ENFORCEMENT, OR

36
00:01:44,304 --> 00:01:46,373
IN INTELLIGENCE, BOTHER THE

37
00:01:46,373 --> 00:01:47,407
ELECTORAL PROCESS UNLESS THERE'S

38
00:01:47,407 --> 00:01:49,909
A REALLY GOOD REASON.

39
00:01:49,909 --> 00:01:51,011
SO I THINK WHEN YOU GET TO THE

40
00:01:51,011 --> 00:01:52,712
END OF IT, THERE'S NO LAW THAT

41
00:01:52,712 --> 00:01:55,448
SAYS YOU CAN'T SEND AN INFORMANT

42
00:01:55,448 --> 00:01:56,049
VIRTUALLY ANYWHERE.

43
00:01:56,049 --> 00:01:57,651
SO WHAT WE'RE GOING TO GET DOWN

44
00:01:57,651 --> 00:02:00,286
TO IN THE END IS DID THEY HAVE A

45
00:02:00,286 --> 00:02:02,255
GOOD REASON TO BE WORRIED.

46
00:02:02,255 --> 00:02:04,824
IF THEY DID HAVE A GOOD REASON

47
00:02:04,824 --> 00:02:06,359
TO BE WORRIED, WAS AN

48
00:02:06,359 --> 00:02:07,360
APPROPRIATE RESPONSE TO SAY I'M

49
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:09,029
NOW GOING TO LOOK AT THE TRUMP

50
00:02:09,029 --> 00:02:11,231
CAMPAIGN AS IF THEY'RE IN A

51
00:02:11,231 --> 00:02:12,732
CONSPIRACY WITH RUSSIA OR WOULD

52
00:02:12,732 --> 00:02:15,235
IT HAVE BEEN MORE APPROPRIATE TO

53
00:02:15,235 --> 00:02:17,203
SAY THEY MAY HAVE A FEW ROTTEN

54
00:02:17,203 --> 00:02:19,105
APPLES IN THERE, LET'S SEE IF WE

55
00:02:19,105 --> 00:02:21,141
CAN EITHER INTERVIEW THE ROTTEN

56
00:02:21,141 --> 00:02:22,709
APPLES AND SEE HOW ROTTEN THEY

57
00:02:22,709 --> 00:02:24,911
REALLY ARE, OR MAYBE WE SHOULD

58
00:02:24,911 --> 00:02:25,845
TIP OFF SOMEBODY IN THE CAMPAIGN

59
00:02:25,845 --> 00:02:27,347
AND ASK THEM TO BE CAREFUL.

60
00:02:27,347 --> 00:02:29,082
>> THAT'S WHAT I FIND SO

61
00:02:29,082 --> 00:02:29,783
INTERESTING, FASCINATING,

62
00:02:29,783 --> 00:02:31,785
BECAUSE YOU TALK ABOUT THE

63
00:02:31,785 --> 00:02:33,119
MEETING, PRESIDENT OBAMA, SUSAN

64
00:02:33,119 --> 00:02:34,521
RICE, JIM CLAPPER.

65
00:02:34,521 --> 00:02:35,789
IT'S POSSIBLE, I THINK YOU

66
00:02:35,789 --> 00:02:37,557
WEREN'T 100% SURE WHETHER

67
00:02:37,557 --> 00:02:47,867
BRENDAN WAS IN THAT PARTICULAR

68
00:02:47,867 --> 00:02:48,234
MEETING --

69
00:02:48,234 --> 00:02:50,670
>> WE LOOK AT WHO WAS IN THE

70
00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:51,871
OBAMA NATIONAL SECURITY COUNCIL.

71
00:02:51,871 --> 00:02:52,706
THE INTERESTING THING ABOUT

72
00:02:52,706 --> 00:02:53,973
THIS, THEY PUT THE TIME FRAME

73
00:02:53,973 --> 00:02:56,176
HERE, WHICH I FIND PECULIAR, ONE

74
00:02:56,176 --> 00:02:57,510
OF THE THINGS THAT SHOULD BE

75
00:02:57,510 --> 00:03:01,114
EASY TO KNOW, IS WHAT DATE DID A

76
00:03:01,114 --> 00:03:02,649
NATIONAL SECURITY COUNCIL

77
00:03:02,649 --> 00:03:03,750
PRINCIPALS MEETING HAPPEN.

78
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:05,652
EVERYBODY ASKED ABOUT IT SAYS,

79
00:03:05,652 --> 00:03:08,354
YEAH, LIKE LATE SPRING.

80
00:03:08,354 --> 00:03:10,090
THAT GETS MY ANTENNAS UP WHEN

81
00:03:10,090 --> 00:03:11,725
THEY DON'T WANT TO TELL YOU WHEN

82
00:03:11,725 --> 00:03:12,258
SOMETHING HAPPENED.

83
00:03:12,258 --> 00:03:15,095
>> IS THAT TIMETABLE SO

84
00:03:15,095 --> 00:03:15,462
IMPORTANT?

85
00:03:15,462 --> 00:03:17,764
>> THIS IS MONTHS BEFORE CARTER

86
00:03:17,764 --> 00:03:19,466
PAGE GOES TO RUSSIA, RIGHT,

87
00:03:19,466 --> 00:03:21,835
WHICH WE HAD BEEN TOLD WAS THE

88
00:03:21,835 --> 00:03:23,069
ORIGINAL LODGATION STORY THAT

89
00:03:23,069 --> 00:03:24,637
GOT EVERYBODY WHIPPED UP FOR THE

90
00:03:24,637 --> 00:03:25,371
INVESTIGATION, RIGHT?

91
00:03:25,371 --> 00:03:26,806
NEXT THING WE HEARD WAS

92
00:03:26,806 --> 00:03:27,307
PAPADOPOULOS.

93
00:03:27,307 --> 00:03:29,242
WELL, THEY DIDN'T KNOW ABOUT

94
00:03:29,242 --> 00:03:31,578
PAPADOPOULOS UNTIL JULY/AUGUST,

95
00:03:31,578 --> 00:03:31,878
RIGHT?

96
00:03:31,878 --> 00:03:33,413
THIS MEETING, WHERE THEY TALK

97
00:03:33,413 --> 00:03:35,181
ABOUT CARTER PAGE AND THE

98
00:03:35,181 --> 00:03:36,182
NATIONAL SECURITY COUNCIL

99
00:03:36,182 --> 00:03:38,585
HAPPENS ACCORDING TO THEM IN

100
00:03:38,585 --> 00:03:39,452
LATE SPRING.

101
00:03:39,452 --> 00:03:41,988
NOW, WHAT'S HAPPENED BEFORE

102
00:03:41,988 --> 00:03:42,889
THAT, THEY'D BE TALKING ABOUT

103
00:03:42,889 --> 00:03:45,391
CARTER PAGE OF ALL PEOPLE IN A

104
00:03:45,391 --> 00:03:47,093
NATIONAL SECURITY COUNCIL

105
00:03:47,093 --> 00:03:47,427
MEETING?

106
00:03:47,427 --> 00:03:49,095
CARTER PAGE JOINED THE TRUMP

107
00:03:49,095 --> 00:03:52,532
CAMPAIGN ON MARCH 21st.

108
00:03:52,532 --> 00:03:56,302
MANAFORT JOINED IT ON MARCH

109
00:03:56,302 --> 00:03:56,770
29th.

110
00:03:56,770 --> 00:03:57,437
DOESN'T LOOK LIKE THERE WAS

111
00:03:57,437 --> 00:03:59,739
ANYTHING THERE IN THE INTERIM

112
00:03:59,739 --> 00:04:01,407
OTHER THAN THEY HAVE CONCERNS

113
00:04:01,407 --> 00:04:03,343
ABOUT THESE PEOPLE WHO HAVE --

114
00:04:03,343 --> 00:04:05,745
>> WHICH GETS YOU BACK TO THIS

115
00:04:05,745 --> 00:04:06,112
QUESTION.

116
00:04:06,112 --> 00:04:07,881
THERE WAS A CONVERSATION,

117
00:04:07,881 --> 00:04:08,982
ACCORDING TO YOUR REPORT, THAT

118
00:04:08,982 --> 00:04:10,416
THEY SAID SHOULD WE HAVE A

119
00:04:10,416 --> 00:04:11,518
DEFENSIVE BRIEFING.

120
00:04:11,518 --> 00:04:12,652
SHOULD WE CALL THE TRUMP

121
00:04:12,652 --> 00:04:13,887
CAMPAIGN AND SAY, LOOK, LET'S

122
00:04:13,887 --> 00:04:15,522
PUT IT ON THE TABLE, HERE'S WHAT

123
00:04:15,522 --> 00:04:16,488
WE KNOW ABOUT CARTER PAGE.

124
00:04:16,488 --> 00:04:18,558
YOU KNOW, THEY ATTEMPTED TO

125
00:04:18,558 --> 00:04:19,358
RECRUIT HIM AT SOME POINT.

126
00:04:19,358 --> 00:04:21,394
THEN HE ENDED UP COMING ON TO

127
00:04:21,394 --> 00:04:22,362
THEIR SIDE.

128
00:04:22,362 --> 00:04:23,696
RUSSIA TRIED TO RECRUIT HIM, AND

129
00:04:23,696 --> 00:04:24,998
HE CAME ON TO THE INTELLIGENCE

130
00:04:24,998 --> 00:04:26,032
SIDE ON THE U.S.

131
00:04:26,032 --> 00:04:29,202
WHY DID THEY NOT DO THAT IF THEY

132
00:04:29,202 --> 00:04:32,839
WERE SO WORRIED ABOUT THE

133
00:04:32,839 --> 00:04:34,440
INFILTRATION OF RUSSIA AFFECTING

134
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:36,009
THE ELECTION WHY DIDN'T THEY DO

135
00:04:36,009 --> 00:04:36,309
THAT?

136
00:04:36,309 --> 00:04:37,844
>> I THINK THAT'S A VERY GOOD

137
00:04:37,844 --> 00:04:38,211
QUESTION.

138
00:04:38,211 --> 00:04:40,380
YOU WOULD THINK THEY WOULD TAKE

139
00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:45,318
A STEP OR TWO OR THREE BACK FROM

140
00:04:45,318 --> 00:04:46,786
SAYING TWO BAD GUYS HAVE JOIN

141
00:04:46,786 --> 00:04:49,189
THE CAMPAIGN, MAYBE THREE IF YOU

142
00:04:49,189 --> 00:04:50,990
WANT TO THROW GATES IN, BECAUSE

143
00:04:50,990 --> 00:04:52,759
HE HAS RUSSIA BAGGAGE TOO, SO

144
00:04:52,759 --> 00:04:54,260
I'M GOING TO ASSUME THEY MUST BE

145
00:04:54,260 --> 00:04:57,630
IN A ESPIONAGE CONSPIRACY WITH

146
00:04:57,630 --> 00:04:58,898
PUTIN TO STEAL THE ELECTION.

147
00:04:58,898 --> 00:04:59,799
IT DOESN'T WORK THAT WAY.

148
00:04:59,799 --> 00:05:01,968
I THINK IN A NORMAL PROSECUTOR'S

149
00:05:01,968 --> 00:05:03,403
OFFICE, A NORMAL INVESTIGATOR'S

150
00:05:03,403 --> 00:05:05,839
OFFICE, OR A NORMAL PLACE WHERE

151
00:05:05,839 --> 00:05:07,106
THEY DO INTELLIGENCE ANALYSIS HE

152
00:05:07,106 --> 00:05:10,476
WOULD NOT GO FROM -- YOU WOULD

153
00:05:10,476 --> 00:05:12,779
NOT GO FROM A FEW DISTURBING

154
00:05:12,779 --> 00:05:15,248
FACTS TO DEFCON ONE.

155
00:05:15,248 --> 00:05:16,616
IT DOESN'T HAPPEN THAT WAY.

156
00:05:16,616 --> 00:05:18,051
WHAT YOU HAVE TO WONDER, WERE

157
00:05:18,051 --> 00:05:19,819
THEY TRULY CONCERNED -- SOUNDS

158
00:05:19,819 --> 00:05:22,522
LIKE THEY HAD GROUNDS TO BE

159
00:05:22,522 --> 00:05:23,489
CONCERNED -- AND DID THEY AT THE

160
00:05:23,489 --> 00:05:26,826
SAME TIME PERCEIVE THIS COULD BE

161
00:05:26,826 --> 00:00:00,000
POLITICALLY USEFUL?
