AFTER MORE THAN A CENTURY OF TEACHING MILLIONS OF AMERICAN BOYS MARKMANSHIP, WOOD CRAFTS, PATRIOTISM, GOOD CITIZENSHIP, THE BOY SCOUTS OF AMERICA HAVE DECIDED TO CHANGE COMPLETELY, STARTING WITH THEIR NAME. IT'S NOW THE SCOUTS, GENDER NEUTRAL. NUMBER ONE SHOW, CALLED "RETURNING THE FAVOR." WE SPOKE TO HIM RECENTLY. THANKS A LOT FOR JOINING US. YOU WERE FAMOUSLY AN EAGLE SCOUT AS A BOY. THE SCOUTS ARE NO LONGER THE BOY SCOUTS BUT SIMPLY THE SCOUTS. WHAT'S YOUR RESPONSE TO THAT? WELL, IT'S FUNNY UNDER ASK, BECAUSE NO LESS THAN 10,000 PEOPLE HAVE ASKED ME THAT VERY QUESTION OVER THE LAST MONTH. I BET. ON MY FACEBOOK PAGE, DISTINGUISHED EAGLE SCOUT, IF YOU'RE KEEPING SCORE, FIVE OR SIX YEARS AGO I WAS AWARDED THAT. IT WAS VERY TOUCHING. LOOK, I'M WATCHING WHAT'S HAPPENING CAREFULLY. I'VE SENT 50,000 TO 55,000 LETTERS OUT OVER THE LAST 10 YEARS TO OTHER EAGLE SCOUTS. I THINK THE COUNTRY NEEDS THE SCOUTS. I THINK THE COUNTRY NEEDS THE FUTURE FARMERS OF AMERICA AND SKILLS USA AND 4-H, DESPERATELY, NOW MORE THAN EVER. IT CONCERNS ME TO SEE ALL THE CONFUSION SWIRLING AROUND THE ORGANIZATION, BUT LIKE SO MANY WOUNDS I'M AFRAID SO MANY OF THESE ARE SELF-INFLICTED. I ALSO THINK THAT SOME OF THE CONFUSION GOING ON IS LEGITIMATE. I READ THEIR OFFICIAL STATEMENT. WHILE GIRLS ARE BEING WELCOMED IN, I DIDN'T READ ANYTHING ABOUT INTEGRATED CAMPING TRIPS OR TROOP MEETINGS. I THINK IT'S A PLAY TO COMPETE WITH THE GIRL SCOUTS. I UNDERSTAND WHEN THE GIRL SCOUTS ARE UPSET, BUT SINCE WHEN IS COMPETITION A BAD THING? I THINK CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT AND LEADERSHIP DEVELOPMENT HAVE NEVER BEEN MORE IMPORTANT THAN THEY ARE TODAY. SO MY HOPE IS THAT THE BOY SCOUTS ASSUME THE OPPORTUNITY THAT'S PRESENTING ITSELF, AND BECOME AN ANTIDOTE FOR THE SAFE SPACE ENVIRONMENT THAT'S OUT THERE, AND PUSH BACK A LITTLE BIT. NOT TO SOUND LIKE THE ANGRY GUY ON YOUR NEIGHBOR'S PORCH YELLING AT THE KIDS ON THE LAWN, BUT WHEN I WAS IN THE SCOUTS, IN '64 AND '75, IT WASN'T A SAFE SPACE IN THE BASEMENT OF OUR CHURCH, YOU'D GO HOME WITH A BLOODY NOSE OR A BLACK EYE. WE HAD A BOXING RING. IT WAS A VIBRANT PLACE WHERE YOU REALLY COULD TEST YOURSELF AND HANDMADE YOU SAFE ENOUGH TO ATTEMPT, BUT, ON THE OTHER HAND, DIDN'T TRY AND CHECK EVERY BOX AND PLEASE EVERY SINGLE PERSON. IT'S A TOUGH TIME. YOU KNOW, I'M SYMPATHETIC FOR THE LEADERS, BUT I'M AFRAID YOU'VE GOT TO DRAW THE LINE AND BE CLEAR WHAT YOU STAND FOR AS WELL AS AGAINST. SO YOU DON'T SEE THIS AS THE END OF SOMETHING THEN? I DON'T KNOW. I MEAN, AGAIN, YOU EITHER EVOLVE OR YOU OR YOU DIE. BUT AT THE SAME TIME I THINK PEOPLE ARE CONFUSED BECAUSE THE SCOUTS SIMPLY HAVEN'T COME OUT AND SAID CATEGORICALLY WHAT THEY'RE FOR, RIGHT? SO I JUST THINK THIS CONVERSATION TOUCHES ON EVERY SINGLE POINT RIGHT NOW GOING ON IN POPULAR CULTURE, FROM TOLERANCE TO ACCEPTANCE, WHICH, BY THE WAY, I'M NOT SURE WHAT THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THOSE TWO THINGS IS ANYMORE, BUT THERE USED TO BE A BIG DIFFERENCE. PEOPLE ARE STRUGGLING FOR THEIR OWN IDENTITY. LOOK, THE LAST TIME I WAS ON, WE TALKED ABOUT THE IDEA THAT EVERYTHING IS EITHER BEING OR EVERYTHING IS BEING INFORMED BY PEOPLE WHO WANT TO BE CHALLENGED. I THINK PEOPLE ARE DESPERATE TO BE CHALLENGED. MY HOPE FOR THESE YOUTH-BASED ORGANIZATIONS THAT HELP PREACH CHARACTER IS THAT THEY LOOK FOR PEOPLE WHO WANT TO BE CHALLENGED, AND NOT CURRY FAVOR SO MUCH WITH THOSE WHO WANT A NICE REASSURING PAT ON THE HEAD. YEAH. THAT'S HOW THE EPISCOPAL CHURCH DIED. YEAH. WOW.
