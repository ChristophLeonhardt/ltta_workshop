152
00:05:59,690 --> 00:06:03,810
38.3 she does have a fever guys I think

153
00:06:03,810 --> 00:06:05,910
I didn't go out tonight<font color="#E5E5E5"> maybe spreading</font>

00:06:05,910 --> 00:06:07,860
germs<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay guys about to drive home in</font>

155
00:06:07,860 --> 00:06:10,400
the blizzard<font color="#CCCCCC"> check out those gross roads</font>

156
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:13,080
they don't look that<font color="#E5E5E5"> bad but the slushy</font>

157
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:15,000
stuff is on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the ground right there is so</font>

158
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,640
slippery so can I hit the highway and

159
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:19,230
hopefully I'll get home nice and quickly

160
00:06:19,230 --> 00:06:21,450
and safely so see you guys later hey

161
00:06:21,450 --> 00:06:22,920
guys check it out this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is what the road</font>

162
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:24,960
looks like one before the plows come and

163
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:26,940
what they do is they said<font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't know</font>

164
00:06:26,940 --> 00:06:29,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">if you can see this or not but they set</font>

165
00:06:29,430 --> 00:06:33,120
up three or four plows in a row<font color="#E5E5E5"> gonna</font>

166
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:35,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">come and they all kind of just take down</font>

167
00:06:35,370 --> 00:06:39,990
<font color="#CCCCCC">the entire road and then all the cars</font>

168
00:06:39,990 --> 00:06:41,640
are stuck behind them<font color="#E5E5E5"> but it clears the</font>

169
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:43,410
entire highway it's pretty cool actually

170
00:06:43,410 --> 00:06:44,850
i<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't know if you guys can</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> see they're</font>

171
00:06:44,850 --> 00:06:46,560
not<font color="#E5E5E5"> but i'll put it this video work</font>

172
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:48,390
you'll see it but it's pretty<font color="#CCCCCC"> neat how</font>

173
00:06:48,390 --> 00:06:50,190
to do that<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then the entire high wake</font>

174
00:06:50,190 --> 00:06:52,320
is cleared all in one shot<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok so here's</font>

175
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:54,360
a perfect example of the double plow

176
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:56,550
thing I was talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about see the one</font>

177
00:06:56,550 --> 00:06:59,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">plow goes up ahead and then the other</font>

178
00:06:59,190 --> 00:07:02,160
plow falls behind him and he just<font color="#E5E5E5"> stays</font>

179
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:03,780
over to the right a little bit so then

180
00:07:03,780 --> 00:07:05,160
he's plowing a whole bunch and he's

181
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:06,420
pushing<font color="#E5E5E5"> it over in front of the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> other</font>

182
00:07:06,420 --> 00:07:08,160
guy who's catching it<font color="#CCCCCC"> and pushing it</font>

183
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:09,960
over to their side now on the highway

184
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:11,670
they do three<font color="#CCCCCC"> of these plows going at</font>

185
00:07:11,670 --> 00:07:14,250
once so it<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it kind of a cool</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> thing to</font>

186
00:07:14,250 --> 00:07:15,960
see when they're all going down the

187
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:17,430
highway because they go pretty fast and

188
00:07:17,430 --> 00:07:19,080
all three of them so it's kind of neat

189
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:20,730
so this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the way they plow the roads</font>

190
00:07:20,730 --> 00:00:00,000
in Canada
