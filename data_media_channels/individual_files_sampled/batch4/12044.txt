now with Trump political ideology has become a little murkier and a little less clear as well over here their questions is he a populist is he a conservative is he a secret Nazi Russian KGB Manchurian Candidate all of the above perhaps from my vantage last week in the motherland perhaps the defining feature of President Trump's political vision came into view is respect for American institutions and tradition his traditionalism among all the calls to topple Columbus statues and rename Columbus Day Trump signed a proclamation on Monday that said quote the permanent arrival of Europeans to the Americas was a transformative event that undeniably and fundamentally changed the course of human history and set the stage for the development of our great nation therefore on Columbus Day not indigenous peoples day Columbus Day we honor the skilled navigator and man of faith whose courageous feet brought together continents and has inspired countless others to pursue their dreams and convictions even in the face of extreme doubt and tremendous adversity so it this seems like a minor point the the tradition of Columbus Day who were honoring what day it is whatever but to Trump it it's quite important because it's about respect and in a an understanding and absorption a living through the institutions that have made our country great and not merely platitudes and and simple words and phrases and ideas that do it he's waiting vigorously on the issue of NFL players not respecting traditions like standing for the national anthem and saluting the flag even his economic policy of skepticism toward big government and big business alike of grand charitable gestures by billionaires that look a lot like Donald J Trump has echoes of the distributism that was embraced by the 20th century traditionalists like GK Chesterton and TS Eliot among others speaking of Eliot even Trump's constant use of highly modern media like reality TV and Twitter to propagate support for traditional institutions reminds one of Eliot's use of modernism to attack - attack modernism rather and yes I think that is the first time that Donald Trump has ever been compared to TS Eliot president Trump's take on patriotism might have been written by Benjamin Disraeli the British traditionalist and Prime my minister who pioneered one nation conservatism and one nation conservatism posits that societies develop organically that members within those societies have obligations toward each other and it emphasizes the pragmatism the reality requires and insists the patriotic devotion among other impulses compelled a fortunate to take care of the less fortunate when one part of America hurts we all heard and when one citizen suffers and injustice we all suffer together loyalty to our nation demands loyalty to one another love for America requires love for all of its people when we open our hearts to patriotism there is no room for prejudice no place for bigotry and no tolerance for hate make America great again is a beautiful phrase it's why Reagan used it in the first place the make America great again it's simple the language is Saxon its Curt its evocative it's called a populist appeal by the common knowledge of the political commentary at but what have they ever known the phrase isn't actually that populist the phrase isn't do whatever you want in America the phrase isn't make america work for youuuu me me me the phrases make America great again it's a call to make use of the strong institutions inherited by this country and developed in this country to sustain the life of a country whose organic growth has produced the most just most charitable most free nation in the history of the world
