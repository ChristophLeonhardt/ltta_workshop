further rallies against Donald Trump's divisive immigration policy are expected across the u.s. later some previous protests turned ugly with government staff tasked with finding and deporting illegal immigrants facing threats and violence in one city police even refused to help let's get details now from the US and Samira Khan hi Samira brick down then how it came to the scenes that we've been witnessing well imagine if you were just going about your day trying to do your job and you were confronted by a bunch of protesters who appear to be threatening what would you do well you call the police I'm assuming but what if you were ignored because of the reputation of the agency you work for now if you're a US citizen this could be claimed as a violation of the Constitution and apparently this is what's happening to Immigration and Customs Enforcement or ice employees in Portland Oregon now ice an agency tasked with cracking down on illegal immigration has accused the mayor of Portland of violating the Constitution by not allowing police to interfere with an anti ice protest for about a month until July 25th activists are preventing ice employees from going in and out of their building protesting against the Trump administration's policies towards the illegal immigrants but anti-ice sentiment is widespread protestors across the country have denounced the agency making some very interesting comparisons ice is the modern day American Gestapo we cannot stand by immoral or injust agencies when ice called the police anti-trump mayor and police commissioner Ted wheeler refused saying his offices officers would not bail out ice now here's how he explained a stance in this case I've consistently stated that I do not want the Portland Police Bureau engaged in securing federal property that houses a federal agency with its own federal police force ice accused the mayor of creating a quote zone of terror and lawlessness but this conflict between wheeler and the Trump administration has been going on for months now in January Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered sanctuary cities like Los Angeles Chicago Portland etc to comply with enforcement efforts now these cities refused with wheeler calling it one of the most disappointing actions he's ever seen from the White House but protests against ice of sprouted nationwide and anti-ice sentiment has trickled up to effect Trump officials even press secretary Sarah Sanders and Secretary of Homeland Security Kirsten Nielsen have heard that I was asked to leave a restaurant this weekend where I attempted to have dinner with my family my husband and I politely left and went home I was asked to leave because I work for president Trump this latest case shows that the u.s. is growing more and more polarized and it's not just limited to protestors we're now witnessing disagreement between the federal government and the state government which could potentially have very severe repercussions Artie Senior Accountant breaking down the story for us Mira thank you very much well let's say try and go a little bit deeper now with their Anthony Brian Logan a blogger who writes on political and social issues and there's always welcome to the program how you doing Anthony is this the thin end of the wedge are we going to see more confrontation between local authorities on the federal government do you think I think you will see more confrontations like this this is not anything new this has been going on for a little while ever since Trump got elected and these people are totally irrational and they're driven largely by the mainstream media because other media talks about over here in the States is ice is evil ice is corrupt the family separation must stop so regular everyday people they're on our phone all day they're getting upset to get in sugar and they go out there and do these things largely because they're being programmed to do so so as long as the mainstream media is complicit and this you continue to see more things like this unfortunately I'm no legal expert but I would have thought that the Portland MERS instruction to police in that city to not protect ice employees is in breach of the Constitution or no oh yes it is Fourteenth Amendment equal protection under the law every person has their right as a US citizens so they're breaking the law they're breaking the Constitution but I guess it doesn't really matter I heard the guy's a ruler the mayor talked about well it's a federal place you know they have their own federal police well the case in which they're talking about is as to random ice agents Welkin and they're being harassed by protesters the local police should put a muzzle on the protesting rather than making a federal government come in and then put boots in the ground I think the regular police would be a much better alternative than having the federal police come in and tried to proto the streets just how United put it in context for us Anthony just how United is the United States right now and especially as president Trump we're continuing to see him all apologetically pressed through divisive policies don't we I think that the United States is much more United then it would seem if you just watch the media if you know over here just you know everyday walking outside it's not really a big deal you see these protests you have a small minority of people to have very loud voices because the voices get amplified by the media now these small groups of people can't do big harm because let's say you have the city of I don't know a million people and you have 100 people blocking the ice office that's a very small population of people but it can create a lot of damage the rest of the average everyday person is not even really politically driven too motivated they're just trying to go to work and take care of their family and their children you
