you guys want to see something funny do you want to see something funny you presumably like a like a duck dynasty hipster guy decked out in paramilitary gear with vague references the patriotism show me something funny actually this is very sad to me oh never mind it's not gonna be funny because it's a ten year old kid doing a makeup tutorial with the title remember when we grew up look at the mess now this guy's young enough to put flag emojis in his post and yet he glorifies his old school mentality as if he grew up in the 50s by the way this generation that you're oh so desperately trying to emulate would laugh at your totally platonic photo sessions with your best buds in your ar-15s on top of pickup trucks there's a quite similar to some of the photos I take on my Instagram you should follow me but yeah meet Adam Calhoun he has over a million likes on his Facebook page and his comedy sketches a liberal use of the term revolve around him being a normal Patriot with a normal beard talking about normal things that he's angry about like entitled snowflakes and how BLM actually stands for being lazy matters and how to bathe like a man maybe you wanna do it Jacuzzi soft Adam is the picture of masculinity because nothing says I'm a fucking man damn it like being so manly that you have to overcompensate for taking a bath give me some real strong Tobias spoon K vibes here Adam but let's take a moment to Pat Adam on the back for raising his son the right goddamn way the patriotic way by forcing him to appear in his shitty facebook video is wearing the ugly-ass t-shirts he's peddling like this video where his son Taemin is forced to play a young supreme fuck boy listen fuck boy in the process of courting Adams hypothetical daughter I just intend to smash your daughter what this has to be child abuse by the way this video on the conservative way to raise children has 22 million views this video ah why are you being so aggressive I want you to feel me I challenge you to use I want you to feel me in any context and have it not be reported to authorities but Adam has even stranger things to teach his son like how to sex for your protection at the economy size you're gonna want this oh why is it vibrate yeah you're right Adam you really showed us liberals that all of our sexual openness and affection is really setting up our children for failure we just take a page from your conservative child-rearing textbook and just lob a dildo at our kids and make vague wild hand gestures when referring to women's genitalia we should also teach them important lessons like the clear guidelines that revolve around gender cuz gender is black and white right do not adjust the screens on your phone that is a 10 year old boy putting on makeup do not age OSIS raise is an actual adult man making fun of a ten-year-old boy for creatively expressing himself so where are the parents a question I asked Adam all the time and is this what we're teaching our young men to be acceptable now yeah we should be teaching them how to raise children like Adam does Adam wrote the fucking book on child-rearing Adams ideal protocol for how to handle a child trying to court your daughter is threatening him with a gun bro making slight sexual gestures and then making them dig their own grave don't worry you're doing a great job bro I'm the problem right I'm the problem that's that's not a problem yes Adam that's not a problem but the following clip is what's a deuce yeah what a weirdly homophobic thing to say also when your son comes home with his buddies why is that the first place your mind goes to is that what you did in your childhood and why does it matter what if one of your son's friends is gay what are you gonna do kick him out of your house you smelled it did you just smell his homosexuality that was the kind of dad I want to be the kind of American dad that puts psychiatrist children through college with all the issues his son probably has after growing up in his regressive ass household oh so that's why I have that fetish that doesn't get old at all look I feel for you Adam phrasing because you're you're kind of similar to a pageant mom in a lot of ways you never actually served in the military even though you desperately try to sell the part and now you're sending your son on a journey you never had the good fortune to take part it Adams son is now enlisted at Fort Benning and he's very proud I hope he finds his independence there and comes back a fine young man and a registered Democrat and look you guys might watch this video and think wow sounds really being a dick and bullying this guy and the truth is I kind of am I'm definitely being hard on Adam but it's not without reason I originally saw his viral video bullying this ten-year-old kid for putting on makeup as if this kid's life won't be hard enough without you rallying your conservative Facebook mom fan base to condemn his lifestyle what do you think was gonna come out of this video Adam did you think you could shame him into conforming or show other parents sharing your videos that it's okay to be intolerant to people kids who are different and that's why I was being kind of harsh on you Adam because we haven't been raising the weird lace oppressive culture that you now desperately try to perpetuate you'd probably be more understanding and realize that this ten-year-old isn't what's wrong with America you are by the way I want to thank you guys for DMing me special people like Adam because it really expands my mind my mind is so open right now I'm woke I've seen the light so definitely continue to message me on my Instagram and a Sandeep Iker or on Facebook I need friends
