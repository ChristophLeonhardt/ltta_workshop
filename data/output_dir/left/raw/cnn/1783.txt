1
00:00:00,179 --> 00:00:03,419
the United States has had
representatives working on this problem

2
00:00:03,419 --> 00:00:07,980
for over 25 years they have done nothing
that's why we're in the problem that

3
00:00:07,980 --> 00:00:12,509
we're in today in addition to frankly
other countries not doing what they

4
00:00:12,509 --> 00:00:20,699
should have done tolerance for this
disgraceful practice must end now a new

5
00:00:20,699 --> 00:00:25,170
order will give the Treasury Department
the discretion to sanction any foreign

6
00:00:25,170 --> 00:00:30,119
bank that knowingly conducts or
facilitates significant transactions

7
00:00:30,119 --> 00:00:39,809
tied to trade with North Korea and again
I want to just say and thank President

8
00:00:39,809 --> 00:00:46,890
Xi of China for the very bold move he
made today that was a somewhat

9
00:00:46,890 --> 00:00:52,110
unexpected move and we appreciate it
new authority in this area applies to

10
00:00:52,110 --> 00:00:57,390
any activity that occurs following my
signature on the executive order which I

11
00:00:57,390 --> 00:01:02,190
have actually just signed foreign banks
will face a clear choice to business

12
00:01:02,190 --> 00:01:08,640
with the United States or facilitate
trade with the lawless regime in North

13
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:14,369
Korea and they won't have so much trade
this new order provides us with powerful

14
00:01:14,369 --> 00:01:20,549
new tools but I want to be clear the
order targets only one country and that

15
00:01:20,549 --> 00:00:00,000
country is North Korea
