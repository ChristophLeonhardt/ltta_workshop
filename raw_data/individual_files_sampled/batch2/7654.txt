new reporting indicates that a secret donor gave a considerable amount of money to help promote Neil Gorsuch on the Supreme Court in fact this donation also had a lot to do with the fact that Merrick garland was blocked from being confirmed as the Supreme Court justice that would replace Antonin Scalia now according to this reporting last year alone an organization known as the wellspring committee gave 23 million dollars to the judicial crisis Network which in turn spent 7 million on materials opposing Garland after President Donald Trump was elected jcn which is also known as the judicial crisis Network spent another 10 million in pro Gorsuch ads so here's what we know so far about these two organizations first off last year was a very lucrative and profitable year well lucrative year for Wellspring as they raised more than twice as much money than in previous in the previous year or any previous year this is largely thanks to one anonymous donor who gave twenty eight point five million dollars so we don't know exactly who that donor is because of their status they are exempt or they don't have to disclose who their donors are they're not required to because they're considered a social welfare organization plenty yeah but here's another component of the story that's relevant Neel Corky who is that's a funny no Corkery Neil Corkery who is listed as Wellsprings president on their tax return is a former judicial crisis Network treasurer and also his wife and also served as wellspring president so there's a lot of inner dealings going on over there ok so let me break this down so they in a sense bought the Supreme Court seat now I say they because we don't know who they're not honest or is so here's what we know and this is exactly what dark money is they set up an organization that under tax law is called a social welfare organization do they help the poor the needy is there no no they don't do any of that they do deeply political things like by a Supreme Court seat but because our no one's at home in our government when it comes to the rich and the powerful they never get investigated the IRS never investigates Emin FTC never investigates them so so this anonymous donor who wanted by a Supreme Court seat gives no to twenty eight and a half million dollars to Wellspring Wellsprings nonsense they don't do anything but buy Supreme Court cease apparently because they spent almost all their money on on this issue as Ana just laid out for you okay so what do they do they then transfer it to the judicial crisis Network who then puts in all this money to influence Republicans to make sure that they block Merrick garland for a year Merrick garland was Obama's appointee now normally the Senate is supposed to give advice and consent the President appoints and then they in a timely manner have to give advice in case and the Republicans said no we're not gonna do our job we don't care we're gonna obstruct him for as long as it takes now it turns out that they were in essence getting paid to do that because we've legalized bribery in this country so in the form of lobbying campaign contributions independent expenditures all coming from this one guy who wanted to buy a Supreme Court seat and we let him so they block garland with seven million dollars that when Gorsuch comes and they're like that's the guy we wanted now remember Gorsuch the one thing he's mon most known for not a right-wing or left-wing although he's massively right we know he's known more for being enormous li pro corporate so there's a famous case where the trucker was gonna freeze to death every other judge that saw that case said he's allowed to drive home so he doesn't die not Gorsuch Gorsuch said no he must obey the corporation no matter what and the corporation said that's our guy that's our guy he let us actually murder not murder that's not fair he'll letter us let our employees die he'll do let us do anything that's the guide that's why course which was selected in the first place and the secret dark money is going around influencing these politicians and it worked they bought themselves a Supreme Court seat what kind of an insane system allows historic money and allow legalized bribery we don't have a democracy these people have captured our government if you don't get the money out we're doomed they're gonna buy the next seat and this one worked it was a proof of concept I know I got a great return on investment for what is it because that the the dark money donor cares about abortion maybe I don't know nobody knows who he is right or it could be that he cares about making sure employees get paid less he makes sure or it could be that he wants to make sure there's no work safety regulations because they you know cut corners on safety and maybe their workers die but hey they need to buy a Supreme Court seat and they did they did and and look I think one of the main reasons why people vote the way they do in general elections for whatever candidates are available is okay well this person is likely to nominate a Supreme Court justice right you hear that argument time and time again and regardless of where you are in the ideological spectrum this should concern you because this means that regardless of who you elect as president you know we have a system that's so corrupt that Congress can be bought and they can go ahead and be obstructionist when it comes to you know the hearings and and you know confirming these individuals that Supreme Court justices I mean it doesn't it doesn't matter what you do as a voter what really matters is what corporate interests want and you know how they can use their influence in the form of millions of dollars to have members of Congress make decisions that they like so they give you more context the Republicans in the last few years not just Merrick garland blocked a hundred justice judges that Obama put into place they only led 20 to go through in the last two years in the first year of Trump they've already okayed 59 justice to go through so three almost three times as much in half the time because why because some guy decided hey I'm going to auction off these seats now do you think that that guy's doing it for his health or could it be that he's going to financially gain from the decisions that Gorsuch is gonna make so we guess what guys and if you're a right winger and you're snickering like we bought us the we're the corrupt party that's awesome congratulations but remember this George Soros Mike Bloomberg etc also have a lot of money so what we've now done is we've started an auction for Supreme Court seats so the next time there's a Supreme Court seat that one guy on the right wing is gonna put in 20 million or 400 million or a bunch of guys and then some people on the Left are gonna be and it's all dark money and we can't see it they're gonna put in twenty a hundred two hundred million dollars and we're gonna have an auction for the Supreme Court seat yeah again I know I know that we're incredibly divided right now but you have to put your political ideology aside for a second and just think about whether or not you value the democratic process because if you value democracy then this should upset you again regardless of what your political ideology is if this had happened if the shoe was on the other foot and it was you know Democrats doing this I would be just as outraged by it because it means that our democracy doesn't matter it doesn't even work it's not functioning corporate interests you don't reign supreme in this case so sometimes people ask hey wolf pack's to get money out of politics but hey are you guys really gonna get Union money out and source money out of course of course we are I don't want Soros buying the elections I don't want the union's buying elections and I don't want corporations to buy elections right when your throat was like oh yeah politicians are corrupt I agree with your brother I got a quick question for you who corrupted them yeah Rush Limbaugh never talks about that right there's a guy behind the curtain buying these politicians and usually it's a corporation and so I care about the corrupted politicians I also care about the people corrupting them get all the money out wolf dash pack.com look do you want don't want to support wolf a go on a sport a different organization bless your heart but they're actually fighting to get you change to bring back democracy and for say at this point America has become almost literally the most corrupt country in the world why do I say that that sounds like an outrageous statement if you're watching television a they tell you everything is totally fine though the reason why there's a revolt and a revolution both on the right and the left is because we legalized bribery all the other countries you actually break the law and make sure you don't get caught and if you do you'll go to jail we just said no it's okay you could put in millions of dollars hundreds billions of dollars into politicians campaigns do it in independent expenditures do this lobbying and
