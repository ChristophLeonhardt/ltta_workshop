Tucker: IT HAS BEEN MANY MONTHS SINCE THE MASS SHOOTING IN LAS VEGAS, THE LARGEST IN MODERN AMERICAN HISTORY. EVEN NOW KEY INFORMATION CONTINUES TO TRICKLE OUT. EVEN AS STEPHEN PADDOCK THE OBVIOUS QUESTION IS, WHY IS THIS FOOTAGE COMING OUT NOW AND WHY DID THE POLICE NOT ACT FOR SEVERAL MINUTES? CATHERINE BARDO IS AN ATTORNEY REPRESENTING SOME OF THE VICTIMS OF THOSE SHOOTINGS AND SHE JOINS US. THANK YOU FOR COMING ON. THE FIRST QUESTION IS, WHY ARE WE FINDING THIS OUT NOW? IT SEEMS LIKE A CENTRAL PIECE OF INFORMATION IN THE STORY. BECAUSE THE COURTS ORDERED THE LAS VEGAS METRO POLICE DEPARTMENT TO RELEASE ALL OF THIS VIDEO FOOTAGE AND PURSUANT TO COURT ORDER, THEY ARE RELEASING IT PIECE BY PIECE OVER THE LAST COUPLE MONTHS. AS YOU KNOW, YESTERDAY WE RECEIVED ABOUT A DOZEN VIDEOS AND MANY MORE AUDIO VIDEOS SHOWING MOSTLY POLICE OFFICER BODY WORN CAMERA FOOTAGE. IT'S FASCINATING AND IT IS ALSO VERY, VERY UPSETTING. IT SHOWS THE EXTREMIS OF THE EVENT AND OF THE TRAUMA THAT EVERYONE THERE, THE 22,000 PEOPLE WHO ARE THERE HAVE SUFFERED. I HAVE BEEN IN THAT VERY HALLWAY 32ND FLOOR. AND WHAT THE VIDEO CLEARLY SHOWS IS ONE PARTICULAR POLICE OFFICER WAS ON THE 31ST FLOOR. NOT THE 32ND FLOOR, AND HE WAS THERE FOR MANY MOMENTS. WHAT WE FIND INTERESTING IS THAT THE MANDALAY BAY SECURITY OFFICER WHO WAS WITH THAT PARTICULAR POLICE OFFICER BEFORE THE SHOOTING STARTED AND RACED THROUGH THE CASINO FLOOR AND RACED UP THE ELEVATORS WITH HIM, THIS PARTICULAR MANDALAY BAY SECURITY GUARD SAID THAT HE WAS ON THE 30 SECOND-FLOOR WITH THAT PARTICULAR OFFICER IN THE VIDEO ON THE 31ST FLOOR. THIS MANDALAY BAY SECURITY MANAGER TOLD THE FBI ON NINE SEPARATE OCCASIONS IN HIS INTERVIEWS THAT HE WAS CERTAIN HE WAS WITH THIS OFFICER HENDRIX ON THE 30 SECOND-FLOOR. THEY ALREADY KNEW OFFICER HENDRIX WAS ON THE 31ST FLOOR BUT, IT WASN'T UNTIL YESTERDAY WHEN ALL OF THAT VIDEO WAS RELEASED THAT WE FINALLY GOT CONFIRMATION THAT SOMETHING IS WRONG, SOMETHING IS AMISS. SCRATCHED THE SURFACE. Tucker: IT'S UNBELIEVABLE. THIS IS THE SECOND TIME IN SEVERAL MONTHS WE'VE SEEN ARMED POLICE OFFICERS STAND THERE WHILE A MASS MURDER TAKES PLACE. I'M SYMPATHETIC TO COPS BECAUSE THEY TAKE A LOT OF BUT I THINK WE DESERVE AN EXPLANATION FOR WHY THIS KEEPS HAPPENING. AS ON MY. ONE LAST THOUGHT ON THAT, I HAVE A CLIENT WHOSE SPOUSE WAS SHOT AND I JUST WANT TO PUT THAT OUT
