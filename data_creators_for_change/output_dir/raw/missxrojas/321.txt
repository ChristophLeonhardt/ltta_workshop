00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:37,829
episode of the series and it's these two

20
00:00:37,829 --> 00:00:40,829
words<font color="#CCCCCC"> much much that's my question</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font>

21
00:00:40,829 --> 00:00:42,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">you you have four years without having</font>

break it to<font color="#E5E5E5"> you you're not running for</font>

24
00:00:47,129 --> 00:00:49,410
anything ever again so about it many

25
00:00:49,410 --> 00:00:50,940
<font color="#CCCCCC">people today are saying the reason that</font>

26
00:00:50,940 --> 00:00:52,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">you want is you connected with those</font>

27
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:54,930
minority voters that are so easily

28
00:00:54,930 --> 00:00:57,510
ignored by Republican candidates so

29
00:00:57,510 --> 00:00:59,460
great that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> fab I'm happy for you but</font>

30
00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:01,739
what's next there's a massive turnout

31
00:01:01,739 --> 00:01:03,660
from Hispanic voters in fact it's

32
00:01:03,660 --> 00:01:05,820
estimated that of all the votes<font color="#E5E5E5"> cast in</font>

33
00:01:05,820 --> 00:01:08,070
this presidential election ten percent

34
00:01:08,070 --> 00:01:09,900
of them were cast by Hispanic voters

35
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:12,869
that's 11.8 million people pretty much

36
00:01:12,869 --> 00:01:15,270
the population of London crazy this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

37
00:01:15,270 --> 00:01:17,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually pretty representative of the</font>

percent of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> US population is hispanic</font>

41
00:01:23,430 --> 00:01:25,470
hispanics account for about fifty

00:01:25,470 --> 00:01:27,360
percent<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the population growth in the</font>

Spanish why am I reminding you of these

46
00:01:33,270 --> 00:01:35,280
things that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you already obviously know</font>

47
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:36,960
because your foreign policy debate was

48
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:39,150
crap don't worry it<font color="#E5E5E5"> wasn't just you it</font>

49
00:01:39,150 --> 00:01:40,920

pretty much everything about it if the

51
00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:44,220
course of the past few months foreign

52
00:01:44,220 --> 00:01:45,899

58
00:01:55,229 --> 00:01:56,939
excuse for a discussion surrounding

59
00:01:56,939 --> 00:01:59,520
Israel and Palestine in which Palestine

60
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:01,320
is never mentioned I think you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> great</font>

61
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:03,210

everyone<font color="#E5E5E5"> who has ever campaigned for</font>

72
00:02:22,620 --> 00:02:24,870
public office in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> u.s. talk about how</font>

73
00:02:24,870 --> 00:02:27,300
America is the greatest country in the

74
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:29,700
world blah blah blah I like you guys i

75
00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:31,350
watch most of your television programs

76
00:02:31,350 --> 00:02:33,300
and I get it I do you guys don't have

77
00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:34,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">the word great in the title of your</font>

78
00:02:34,860 --> 00:02:36,450
country so you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to make up for it by</font>

79
00:02:36,450 --> 00:02:37,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">talking about</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it all the time but when</font>

80
00:02:37,950 --> 00:02:39,690
<font color="#CCCCCC">you have this huge Hispanic voting base</font>

81
00:02:39,690 --> 00:02:41,820
and you're talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> how Great America is</font>

82
00:02:41,820 --> 00:02:43,200
and how America is the greatest country

83
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:45,330
it sometimes makes me want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> hit myself</font>

84
00:02:45,330 --> 00:02:47,610
because America isn't a country<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's a</font>

85
00:02:47,610 --> 00:02:49,170
continent for the way you talk about<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

86
00:02:49,170 --> 00:02:50,910
it looks like<font color="#E5E5E5"> this when actually that's</font>

87
00:02:50,910 --> 00:02:53,160
kind of a lot water your continent and I

88
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:54,840
don't want to shock to anything but

89
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:56,970
you're actually a land mass and there's

90
00:02:56,970 --> 00:02:59,100
all this bit as well now you've talked

91
00:02:59,100 --> 00:03:01,230
about how<font color="#E5E5E5"> United you want America to be</font>

92
00:03:01,230 --> 00:03:03,510
can we talk about the global community

93
00:03:03,510 --> 00:03:05,850
or at least<font color="#CCCCCC"> the American community the</font>

94
00:03:05,850 --> 00:03:07,769
community of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the American continent I</font>

95
00:03:07,769 --> 00:03:09,299
know I have this accent of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> blond</font>

96
00:03:09,299 --> 00:03:10,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">hair and everything but I'm actually</font>

97
00:03:10,830 --> 00:03:13,380
half Mexican and half English and all of

98
00:03:13,380 --> 00:03:15,090
me is extremely concerned about what's

99
00:03:15,090 --> 00:03:16,980
happening Mexico at the moment<font color="#E5E5E5"> and above</font>

100
00:03:16,980 --> 00:03:18,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">all the fact that people who are leading</font>

101
00:03:18,630 --> 00:03:20,519
us don't seem to be acknowledging the

102
00:03:20,519 --> 00:03:22,590
role the US plays in everything that's

103
00:03:22,590 --> 00:03:24,390
going on in Mexico<font color="#E5E5E5"> currently it's</font>

104
00:03:24,390 --> 00:03:26,430
estimated that mexican drug cartels

105
00:03:26,430 --> 00:03:28,769
control ninety<font color="#E5E5E5"> percent of the drugs</font>

106
00:03:28,769 --> 00:03:31,140
entering the USA drugs isn't then a

107
00:03:31,140 --> 00:03:33,060
national issue it becomes an issue of

108
00:03:33,060 --> 00:03:36,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">foreign policy to date over 25,000</font>

109
00:03:36,090 --> 00:03:38,010
<font color="#CCCCCC">mexicans have died as a consequence of</font>

110
00:03:38,010 --> 00:03:40,049
the mexican drug wall and I wonder where

111
00:03:40,049 --> 00:03:41,940
these drug cartels can be getting their

112
00:03:41,940 --> 00:03:44,519
guns from I am genuinely very happy that

113
00:03:44,519 --> 00:03:46,350
you want and I hope<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the next four</font>

114
00:03:46,350 --> 00:03:48,180
years you can demonstrate even better

115
00:03:48,180 --> 00:03:50,040
foreign policy with your surrounding

116
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:51,780
country's foreign policy isn't just

117
00:03:51,780 --> 00:03:53,280
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the whole issue that's happening</font>

118
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:55,290
abroad it's also about your neighbors

119
00:03:55,290 --> 00:03:56,910
and the things that happen in one part

120
00:03:56,910 --> 00:03:58,650
the continent have a direct effect on

121
00:03:58,650 --> 00:04:00,570
other countries within that continent I

122
00:04:00,570 --> 00:04:01,920
really appreciate the<font color="#CCCCCC"> work you've done</font>

123
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:03,930
in your support for immigrants<font color="#E5E5E5"> over the</font>

124
00:04:03,930 --> 00:04:06,060
past four years<font color="#E5E5E5"> and actually even before</font>

125
00:04:06,060 --> 00:04:07,980
that but I do hope that there are some

126
00:04:07,980 --> 00:04:09,840
great<font color="#E5E5E5"> intercontinental projects on the</font>

127
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:11,970
horizon in the next four years

128
00:04:11,970 --> 00:04:13,710
to hope that your re-election has given

129
00:04:13,710 --> 00:04:15,810
you the power and<font color="#CCCCCC"> encourage you to be</font>

130
00:04:15,810 --> 00:04:17,488
able to talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> about issues such as gun</font>

131
00:04:17,488 --> 00:04:19,829
control and really really fight<font color="#CCCCCC"> for them</font>

132
00:04:19,829 --> 00:04:21,298
because tighter controls of gun

133
00:04:21,298 --> 00:04:22,830
ownership would have the security of

134
00:04:22,830 --> 00:04:25,050
your country would also help<font color="#E5E5E5"> Mexican I</font>

135
00:04:25,050 --> 00:04:26,790
get out<font color="#E5E5E5"> of his mouth</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> so that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it systems</font>

136
00:04:26,790 --> 00:04:28,440
can feel secure so that's my big

137
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:30,800
question<font color="#E5E5E5"> for you Obama what's next</font>

138
00:04:30,800 --> 00:00:00,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">thanks bye</font>
