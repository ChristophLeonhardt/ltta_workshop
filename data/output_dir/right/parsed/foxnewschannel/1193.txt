SHANNON.
>> Shannon: A BIT OF WHIPLASH.
I CAN'T KEEP TRACK.
THE SUGGESTION IS NO.
JOHN, THANK YOU.
THE SUPREME COURT SIDES OF THE
BAKER WHO REFUSED TO MAKE A
CUSTOM CAKE FOR A SAME-SEX
COUPLE.
TODAY'S DECISION LEAVES
UNANSWERED QUESTIONS.
>> JACK PHILLIPS WAS NOT
TOLERATED BY THE CIVIL RIGHTS
COMMISSION OF COLORADO.
>> THE LEGAL TEAM FOR COLORADO
BAKER JACK PHILLIPS IS
CELEBRATING STAY.
AFTER A 7-2 SUPREME COURT
OPINION HOLDING THAT PHILLIPS
NEVER GOT A FAIR SHAKE WHEN HE
WAS SUED BY A GAY COUPLE AFTER
DECLINING TO CREATE A CUSTOM
CAKE IN CELEBRATION OF THEIR
SAME-SEX WEDDING.
WRITING FOR THE MAJORITY,
JUSTICE KENNEDY NOTED THAT AT
LEAST ONE OF THE COLORADO
COMMISSIONERS WHO HEARD THE
ORIGINAL COMPLAINT LIKENED
PHILLIPS' EXPLANATION AND
RELIGIOUS BELIEFS TO THOSE WHO
SUPPORTED SLAVERY AND THE
HOLOCAUST.
"THIS SENTIMENT IS INAPPROPRIATE
FOR COMMISSION CHARGED WITH THE
SOLEMN RESPONSE WILL BE A FAIR
AND NEUTRAL ENFORCEMENT OF
COLORADO'S ANTIDISCRIMINATION
LAW."
KENNEDY POINTED OUT THAT A
NUMBER OF THE COMMISSIONERS
STATEMENTS IMPLIED "THEIR
RELIGIOUS BELIEFS PERSONS ARE
LESS THAN FULLY WELCOME IN
COLORADO'S BUSINESS COMMUNITY."
KENNEDY HIMSELF NOTED THAT THE
BROADER LEGAL ISSUES IN THIS
DISPUTE ARE FAR FROM SETTLED.
I MUST BE DONE SO WITH TOLERANCE
FOR BOTH SIDES BECOME A LIVING
LGBT ADVOCATES WITH MIXED
FEELINGS.
>> WE ARE CERTAINLY DISAPPOINTED
THAT THE SUPREME COURT FOUND IN
THIS NARROW SET OF CIRCUMSTANCES
IN FAVOR OF THE BAKER.
BUT WHAT'S IMPORTANT HERE IS A
SUPREME COURT IN NO WAY
UNDERMINED OUR NATION CIVIL
RIGHTS LAWS.
>> Shannon: THE COUPLE OF THE
CENTER OF THE CASE, CHARLIE
CRAGG AND DAVE MULLINS, SAY
"TODAY'S DECISION MEANS OUR
FIGHT AGAINST RISK TERMINATION
AND UNFAIR TREATMENT WILL
CONTINUE.
WE WILL CONTINUE FIGHTING UNTIL
NO ONE DOES."
IN JUSTICE GINSBURG'S DISSENT,
JOINED BY JUSTICE TOTAL MAYOR,
SHE FOUND IT IRRELEVANT THAT
PHILLIPS SOLD CAKES AND COOKIES
TO AND CUSTOMERS DESPITE THE
FACT THAT HE WOULD NOT CREATE
CUSTOM WEDDING CAKES FOR THEM,
ADDING "I SEE NO REASON WHY THE
COMETS OF ONE OR TWO
COMMISSIONER SHOULD BE TAKEN TO
OVERCOME PHILLIPS REFUSAL TO
SELL A WEDDING CAKE."
BOTH SIDES AGREE THAT TODAY'S
OPINIONS DOES NOT SETTLE THE
ISSUES.
THE JUSTICES WILL CONSIDER
WHETHER OR NOT TO HEAR THE CASE
OF A WASHINGTON STATE FLORIST
