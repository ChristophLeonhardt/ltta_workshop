one of the things I suggest one of the most controversial is white people engaging in giving an IRA individual reparations account my name is Michael Eric Dyson I'm University professor of sociology at Georgetown University and I'm the author of tears we cannot stop a sermon - white America I don't mean for white people to give up their money to black people what I'm suggesting is that reparations in America are certainly do as a result of the systemic denial of opportunity to black people and even though it's a morally compelling argument Martin's the King jr. in his book why we can't waste it if America has done something special against the Negro for three and four hundred years America must now do something special for the Negro for three hundred four hundred years so when I talk about individual IRAs however I'm talking about individual things that individual white brothers and sisters can do without waiting for the government pay the lawn person who is black that you pay a little bit extra find young people in your school or in your city who need computers take them to visit places they would never ordinarily go in other words there is an individual way in which white brothers and sisters who are well-meaning well-intended who desire to change American society for the best can enable people of color especially black people and especially poor black kids to be advantaged by and benefited by some of the gestures of not only philanthropy but of recognition of the injustice is that black people have suffered and therefore address them all I'm suggesting is that white brothers and sisters be creative about ways in which they can address the racial miasma the racial suffering that we see confronting American culture
