I am allocable ah it's an exciting week ahead at the stream famiiy is at the South by Southwest Conference & Festival in Austin Texas and we'll be bringing you a series of programs on technology and innovation today what are the ethical implications of immersive storytelling tools like augmented reality and virtual reality are growing in popularity but is it a fad or the way of the future first so over to dummy in Austin - hi there Malika thank you so much this is the 35th floor of the Fairmont Hotel right down in downtown Austin and it's here in this neighborhood for the next couple of days that people who've got great ideas great technology they all come to show them off which is why the London Mayor Sadiq Khan is here he wants to talk about the technological revolution and investment in London so I asked him where would you take us in London that is very high-tech in Greenwich we are piloting autonomous vehicles I said you can pilot them autonomous vehicles are a good thing to pilot but we don't one must miss and so exampling great show of autonomous vehicles is very exciting using the underground the the tube system the you've done with I have a situation where you can use content as payments you can use a credit card to get from Unity cash but also there's there are apps you can see your journey time you can plan your journey there are city map as you can get across our city this year will be having air quality monitors across London and you'll be able to monitor the quality of air in different parts of the city and I could go on let me give you a challenge here this is you and mills he is a urban planner urban designer worked in London he had a challenge for you know technology is radically changing the way the cities one but despite all this change the way that we planned cities hasn't changed much in the last hundred years and the only way to actually effectively plan our emerging 21st century cities is to use 21st century tools tools like artificial intelligence mixed reality there's internet of things only using these tools we'll be able to create a planning system which is from the agile inclusive and transparent and the question is in this day and age when these tools are transforming all other industries why is it though the way we plan cities is so firmly stuck in the past good question so we've probably recently a draft London plan that addresses this issue and we've got to think about how cities work whether it'll live work play study and give you a simple example when it comes to new developments a developer is required to think about essential public utilities gas electric water well ultra-fast broadband is now an essential public utility when it comes to designing new buildings we've got to think about technology and adaptation so as we've now got a situation where every building that's built would think about making sure it's a smart building thinking about you know where people live but also can you have joint work lift spaces can you make sure you're thinking about coal living when it comes to new generations of Londoners and the points that you and raises are the challenges that politicians and policy makers have failed to address biggest issue by the way is making sure that we scale up Londoners and citizens have all around the world have got to be skilled up to make sure they've got the skills for the jobs of tomorrow the smart jobs he's spent a man Eluga he says so many people moving urban centres hence a huge consumption consumption of resources that offer no chance of ecological sustainability so we're making all London all fancy all smart but is it sustainable so one of the things that I've got and I've announced recently is for London to be the world's first national park city what I mean I want half of London to be green it's currently 40 odd percent and so we're also encouraging more people to walk to cycle and to use public transport and we've got the world's first toxicity charge and they'll have it next year the worst the world's first ultra low emission zone and the questions are really important we've got to think how a city that's growing and by the way currently half the world's population lives in cities in in 15 years time it'll be 60 percent so more and more people are moving to cities and that's why it's really important we work with other mayors and other cities to learn best practice hope so yeah absolutely right oh yeah yeah I've been pretty important to me walking cycling exercise our using public transport you'll see me on on the tube and the buses at most days so it's really important I was wondering what kind of strategies is London using to make sure all the coming smart city technologies reaches everyone how do you set your priorities inclusion first was really really important so we've set up two things that are relevant to this issue one is skills for Londoners and secondly is a digital tech program so we're making sure youngsters particularly women and those from deprived communities have these skills tracks as the jobs for tomorrow all of us should be learning things like coding I understand the importance of how technology works but also we've made sure we use technology in a smart way data connectivity and innovation to make sure our city works much more smarter we're a growing city nothing wrong with growth is planning for that growth and the digital revolution is one we're going to plan for the growth headline then for this conversation when people watching it and think okay in future when I go to London else not will it be we already are very small City or London to be the smartest city in the world in relation to things like quality of air public transport health jobs connectivity we are the world's greatest city we very soon will be the world man I know you've got a lot to do nice as you or not good to see you could see could see fennel under the hair as well so that's the Mayor of London Sadiq Khan if you want to follow his progress how much smarter can he make London you can follow him on Twitter at accident Khan min ago from a city of the future to the future of journalism and storytelling virtual reality is an immersive experience and augmented reality is a way to make the user part of an experience taking them into an enhanced version of their but may even transcend space and time it allows voyeurism and full immersion I have a 360 camera used to make AR and BRE experiences set up right here on the desk and it's showing you our view right there I'm joined by Gobbo Arora he's professor of immersive storytelling at Johns Hopkins University I'm the director of Zickuhr a Sufi revival will see clips of that during the show and here in Austin with me I've got Laura Hertz field she is from journalism 360 in a sentence Laura how do you describe what you do so journalism 360 is a program that helps journals tell better stories using immersive technology nicely done no needle Opena I know welcome to the stream CEO and founder of emblematic group which does what so we're done for I'm actually known for having pioneered the use of rich reality for doing journalism and my company of automatic group we do a whole range of virtual reality and augmented reality experiences very nice so I went in search of a VR experience just 24 hours ago and this is who I found have a look my name is Morgan Carlson and I'm a developer for a company called global core out of Toronto Ontario Canada okay but you can actually get in here and you can just kind of walk around and see what it feels like you have this whole table here exists in the virtual world as well okay all right feel free feel kind of walk around okay so we go to a hospital room in the year 2030 and kind of look at some of the technological advancements said to be helping medicine and then from there we go to Mars in the year 2130 so jump for it another hundred years and look at some of the things that because of I Triple E members will make colonizing other planets like Mars a whole lot easier for humans and it kind of helps us look forward at the future of what's possible so something like this technology is great because rather than just having literature or photos or videos to show someone we can actually immerse them in a world that doesn't necessarily exist yet and maybe inspire someone to help make that world exist a little bit sooner so god well we saw one example of an immersive experience right there I want to start with this tweet from our community member doe Lonnie Robert who says we all know there are no perfect products without negative potential but AR VR technology tends to provide positive potential more than the negative so we definitely have fans out there but before we delve deeper into this conversation help us understand what is the difference if there is one between AR augmented reality and virtual reality I think thank you for having me again and I'm really excited to be here with VR we have something that completely hacks your senses and totally takes you and transports you into another world and AR is mostly overlaying your current reality of what you can see with other content so that you know where you are but it's being augmented rather than being totally transported into another world and this is done with the use of tools that help you stay in this world but see other things correct yes so with VR mostly it's going to be a headset where you're going to give up all your senses and go into another world and with AR you can actually right now do it on your actually you can even do it on the new iPhone and a lot of other Android phones as well where you can augment it through your camera app and you can see what's happening so ladies I want to share this with you this is a tweet from Katherine Alan - Alan runs a VR company VR experiences and she says on Twitter that there's also VR heritage in gaming video game uses a mainly boys and men this means men are more likely to see VR as relevant to them Nora I think it's it depends on the content sure I think right now I think video game technology is much further along in the VR space they sort of started it that's kind of where this you know they've been working on it a lot longer but it really depends on the type of content and I think that you know the work that Nanni's doing in this space that God was doing this space is much more Universal than you know some of those gaming projects so I think that the numbers for women gaming people don't realize that more women than men game or casual gamers and men so the idea that that because we're looking at shooter games is somehow the most popular and the way that we define genre it's a mistake in fact virtual reality not only does it allow for content that will be attractive to women but it allows for content that's going to be changing all kinds of different experiences from games to education to journalism to medical to industrial I mean so so this is a really it cometh what can you do with film and to give it this narrow focus I think of the attention this is a boy's thing this is a woman's thing okay my sense and there's been a lot of research also around you know sort of the headsets and there was talked at first like are the headsets a sexist thing because of how they're developed and I think that is the technology is just changing and getting better every day so to look at it and not lens is a little bit short-sighted so I'm glad that you brought up that tweet from me because I actually she had a whole chain there and Katherine Allen on Twitter this is one other one she brings she says there are loads of tacit small signals that women get from the culture that high tech just isn't for them example when I bought a headset I was asked by the shop assistant if it was for my boyfriend so we've all been talking about headsets Gobbo I have one on my desk here this is via Google but this is what it looks like for audience to kind of get a glimpse at how you experience these experiences you pop a phone in here this one is an Android this is Samsung you close that up there and pop it over your head I'm not going to do so on onset here but you would use a headset similar but different than this to see your experience which is called Zickuhr a Sufi revival it premiered at the Sundance Film Festival where we were not too long ago have a look at what that experience is like it's visually stunning Gobbo tell us about what we were looking at you were looking at Sufi Islamic rituals in Tunisia and you didn't see it in this one but you basically are in this experience with three other people's there's four people in total these real people are these virtual people real people I had Sundance we had it with a total of four people that then participate in this ritual with what you saw there so you're able to have instruments you're able to sing you're able to dance and participate because Sufism is only understood through participation it's not voyeuristic it's not something that's easy to learn through reading or a flat screen you need to be there you need to make yourself vulnerable and so we thought we'd use the technology to give people this experience and to let loose you know and to like find a divine through this sort of vulnerability that comes that I think this new technology now is bringing so it was very interesting to see people of all shades and stripes with different I think opinions about Islam about people that are different than them but you know engaging with this content in a new way that I think this technology allows Nonie you know I think what our team found remarkable here is that so often there's a criticism that a R & B R is really about taking you away from the rest of society whereas in this experience you're doing it with other as gobble mentioned real people can you talk to us about the significance of that so I think that people still have this idea of that like gaming folks wouldn't be kind of in their dungeon basement and be isolated from other people and that just isn't the case anymore I tell the story of my daughter walking in from my outside garage office and my son has got his laptop open in the living room and he looks up at her and she says why did you leave but what he meant was why did you leave the server we were playing on together so it just means that collaborative spaces are going to be just different than maybe going to a movie theater or you know a stadium even though what's gonna happen is that your goggle and your phone are gonna merge I was just at Qualcomm last week looking at their brand new edge computing systems and they're basically running the most powerful experiences VR AR right off your mobile phone with a little headset it's gonna get down to glasses size so we're gonna be together in these experiences at a very normal basis Louis Gaby was speaking you it you had nothing with great passion well here because yeah well his piece cover your piece Edie Sundance was one of my favorite things to see that experience together that sort of you know almost haptic relationship where you're standing in a circle and can kind of feel everybody around you together and it's something that's really unique I think the challenge that I'd love to hear what everybody sort of thinks about this too I think the challenge is how you democratize that and how long it's going to take us to get to that point where you know we're all able to you know experience it together and you don't have to be at a Sundancer at a museum with you know this smaller group of people what I saw on Friday at Qualcomm it's not gonna get very long it's great because they've been working on developing what's called edge computing and it means that the power will live off your goggles but the goggles themselves will yes it'll show the imagery but you won't need to have huge power you know computer is always attached to it it'll be more like your mobile phone mobile what were you going to say yeah with with Zickuhr right now it's in real life experience where you have to be at sundance and we're going to have it at installations where it's proving to be very popular these types of things and museums and cultural centers but we are going to develop it for steamvr which is an ability for people to network into it from different locations in the world and do the ritual together and then learn and come together on these things and so I think you know it is it is possible now but I think as nani was saying it's going to get a lot easier and a lot more exciting where i'm going to i think we're going to be networking into these things and doing a lot of stories together and learning a lot of these things together which i think is an exciting time i pulled up this suite on my screen here this is from Angela and she says I agree that virtual communities are important and respects I only fear that they're supplanting our physical community engagement to a worrying degree so one person who has a slight fear there here's another person though with some concern this is price of silence who says we have to use AR and VR with restraint to not further dehumanize the experience in the novelty what about seeing a woman dragged through the streets of declare square in Egypt representing women brutalized by the military in Gaza are women confronting police in the US so some interesting aspects she's brought up there Laura but the thing about these experiences is you are right there are there any dangers or any responsibilities that the makers of this have to make sure that people not dehumanize that experience yeah well I mean I think that's why it's so important that journalists are working in this space you know people like frontline and emblematic has been working on projects like Greenland melting which you can see it's alpha and not even talked more about but some you know all of these journalistic institutions whether it's PBS the New York Times The Guardian they have very strict you know rules around their journalism in standards that they have to hold up that are pretty much made public by their various Ombudsman and I think you know in VR it's not that much it is different and it's it we're talking about it in a different way but these organizations have been holding up standards of journalism for a very long time so I think when content comes through we have to start you know trusting these organizations I wanted to ask you something and it just in a sentence for our audience who don't know what oculus rift is because I'm going to bring in a video comment from our community but I want them to know what oculus rift is before they see it so oculus rift is a headset manufacturer it's one of the many manufacturers I was with the founder of oculus before he was the founder and Sundance with the first of earpiece in hey Everett my shameless name yeah why not what and so Palmer went on nine months later after crashed in the hotel room and driving the truck back to start oculus rift and then everybody should know he went on saw the company for three billion dollars alright so VR system that immerses you in different worlds now he has that in mind he's Aaron Frank this is about the benefits of VL have a listen both augmented and virtual reality today are seeing an incredible rate of development we're seeing brand new use cases come online it's a really exciting time in the space one of the application areas that's really exciting for something like say virtual reality is education one of the really powerful aspects of using virtual reality is the idea that by putting on a headset that completely immerses you inside a virtual world and by using your hands the the input devices for virtual reality are hand controllers is that inside these environments you can actually do things that otherwise would be very difficult to do so you know one of the things you do is you help bring a groups of story tell us together for the greater good so if you were trying to persuade us this is this is more than gaming there's so much more that VR augmented reality can do what would be the best example you can give us I mean I think anytime you're able to put yourself in someone else's shoes is an experience that you can have in VR that is really challenging to have in other types of media there's a project there's so many things going on right now but one of the projects we funded it's called the wall which USA Today created with the Arizona Republic and you're at the border wall you know in Arizona and on the border of Mexico and those sort of proposed Trump border wall and you're able to see these many documentaries in real life where they are happening you know along that that stretch of land and you're taken to a place that you couldn't otherwise be able to visit and I think those types of experiences are you know the ones that are really impactful and meaningful and last with people in a way that just reading a piece in the paper doesn't you know convey it as all the time so I know you wanted to jump in there but as we're talking about impact I wanted to first play this video comment this is from a father son team who sent us this added sunnyvale have a listened to Christopher and August I use my oculus rift pretty much every day in my art workflow so once August was old enough to put on the headset and actually see something in it of course he wanted to try it out too so the first thing I had him try was took brush and he absolutely loved it we started out with him just using the the paintbrush while I managed all the tools but of course kids learn really fast so before long he was managing the brush and all the tools by himself no he gets a 10-minute session pretty much every day after I get home from work what do you like about tilt brush August you like drawing until brush what's your favorite brush go the disco brush yeah why is that your favorite because I like the colors can't help but chuckle I've got but what did you want to add well I mean I think when we talked it was a little bit bring it back to the ethics thing because I think I do think there's a lot of concern about VR being isolating and everything but I mean I want to be a little provocative I mean I think the investments for VR and AR are coming from you know big you can say Technopolis you know big companies that I think are right now being criticized rightly so for how we're dealing with our privacy how we're dealing with our algorithms of addiction of fake news of everything and I think if we don't really fix those things and link it with what's happening in VR AR I fear for that ten-year-old child because I think in a lot of ways you know you watch YouTube now its whole point is to keep you addicted forever I just worry that if we're not going to solve the problems in what's happening with the companies now and what they're doing when VR and AR really truly hit I think that's when things get more difficult cuz you're going to have more data on people know where I would I look at my heart rate you're going to have a lot more targeted ways to advertise at me but also manipulate me so we have to be careful Gary thought Gobbo and that will be the subject of our next show Davao Laura and noni thank you so much for being here out of time we look forward to having you back on the show though to our community don't forget to check out the work done by the Al Jazeera immersive media studio contrast VR before we go just enough time to tell you what's ahead on Tuesday how can pop music help empower communities and promote change I mean I will be joined by artists who push their listeners to act until next time we'll see you online don't forget to use our special hashtag this week stream at South by Southwest
