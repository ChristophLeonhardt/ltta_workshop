00:00:09,130 --> 00:00:12,160
Every July, the elderflowers
come into bloom.

2
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:16,819
And I'm always watching and waiting for
that moment when they do finally pop.

3
00:00:16,819 --> 00:00:21,560
This one tree in particular, which
sits at the base of the restaurant,

4
00:00:21,560 --> 00:00:24,510
I can see it from where I'm cooking.

5
00:00:25,750 --> 00:00:32,070
It's one long week where you can
enjoy the blossoms before they go by.

6
00:00:32,710 --> 00:00:35,539
I love to harvest this for a
couple of reasons.

7
00:00:35,539 --> 00:00:39,859
I love to make cordials that
are citrusy and sweet

8
00:00:39,859 --> 00:00:44,330
and steep them overnight
to make syrups and sorbets.

9
00:00:44,830 --> 00:00:47,929
And then I also really like to
make elderflower fritters, which

10
00:00:47,929 --> 00:00:54,189
you can take the full stem of the flowers
and dredge them in some powdered sugar

11
00:00:54,189 --> 00:00:58,159
and a little bit of club soda for
crispy elderflower fritters.

12
00:00:58,159 --> 00:01:03,070
They're just really delicious
summery treats that

13
00:01:03,070 --> 00:01:06,117
always just represent the
perfect time in July in Maine.

14
00:01:06,117 --> 00:01:08,920
All of the ingredients
that are so important to us

15
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:12,010
come from the women who
work at the restaurant.

16
00:01:21,490 --> 00:01:23,759
Each year we host a series of suppers.

17
00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:28,260
We start at 6 p.m. and
do one seating, it's a prix-fixe

18
00:01:28,260 --> 00:01:32,500
set multicourse menu
that is really driven by

19
00:01:32,500 --> 00:00:00,000
the seasons and by the
ingredients of Maine.
