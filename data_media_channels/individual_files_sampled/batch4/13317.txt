just read the entire memo to you verbatim because not that long it's about four pages long so here is what we know according to Fox News the memo suggests that the FBI when it first gathered a FISA warrant on on Carter page Carter page was a from a foreign policy adviser and he was supposedly colluding with the Russians right this was the supposition of the FBI this is why they went and got a FISA Warren an American citizen who was a member of the Trump campaign the question is what was that warrant based on when he submitted applications and FISA courts you have to say here's why we have probable cause to believe that we need a wiretap on this guy so what did they use for that well according to the according to the memo the only thing that they used and the central component that they used was the steel dossier the steel dossier was a piece of bad research compiled by a spy named Christopher Steele who went over to Russia and talked to probably some paid Russian folks and it was done on behalf of fusion GPS using GPS and Apple research firm originally fusion GPS and was hired by the Washington free beacon to do Apple research on Trump they cut out of that project but then fusion gps shopped around that Intel and Hillary Clinton decided that she was going to fund the Oppo research file so she funded the fusion GPS dossier which was based on research from Christopher Steele who was getting information from the Russians that information was then funneled to the FBI and the FBI based on that unverified dossier based on their a piece of information that were unwilling to verify went to the FISA courts now why is that a big deal it's a big deal for a couple of reasons it's a big deal for a couple of reasons number one the Fox News is called Fox News is quoting from the memo they're the only people have access is Washington Examiner and Fox News at this point according to Fox News Christopher Steele look I could compiled the memo the original dossier that the warrant was based on admitted his feelings against then-candidate Trump in September of 2016 when he said that Steele was quote desperate that president from not get elected and was passionate about him not being president but that's not the only thing that's in the memo according to to the Washington Examiner calling Byron New York at the Washington Examiner the steel dossier formed an essential part of the initial in all three renewal FISA applications against Kyra page here is the key point Andrew McCabe the deputy FBI director who just resigned confirmed that no FISA warrant would have been sought from the FISA Court without the Steele dossier information in other words they used as the centerpiece of getting a warrant on an American citizen who was part of the Trump campaign and Oppo research hit from Hillary Clinton that was non verified what's even worse the political origins of the steel dossier were known to senior DOJ and FBI officials but excluded from FISA applications so by omission they lied to the court they went to the FISA Court and they said we have information that all this stuff is happening with regard to Carter page but they didn't say we got this from a fusion GPS dossier compiled by Hillary Clinton because then the court might have said well have you checked any of this then the court might have thought well have you checked into this and this raises some serious questions by the way about the operations of FISA courts if they're not actually doing the research and asking the FBI to verify that the information they're being provided is actually true if they're just putting things like the Russian P tape remember the dossier was filled with a bunch of bad information like the idea that Trump had gone to Moscow and then hired a hotel he tried to get the room that Barack Obama Michelle Obama had stayed and then hired Russian prostitutes to pee on the bed you recall this it was most of the stuff was nonsense and nearly none of it has been verified if they were using that unverified information to get a FISA wards and the FISA Court went along with that without asking any other questions that had some broader questions about how far the courts are actually putting out the warrants apparently DOJ official Bruce or met with Steele beginning in the summer of 2016 and that's when Steele told him that he wanted Trump not to be President the FBI and Justice Department is all according to Washington Examiner bomber New York the FBI and Justice Department mounted a month-long effort to keep the information outlined in the memo out of the house intelligence committees hands only the threat of contempt charges and other forms of pressure forced the FBI and Justice to give up the material once Intelligence Committee leaders and staff compiled some of that information into the memo the FBI and Justice Department supported by Capitol Hill Democrats mounted a ferocious campaign of opposition saying release of the memo would endanger national security in the rule of law now if what these excerpts show is what's really the main point of the memo I don't know how that endangered national security or the rule of law that looks like that was a cover if that's the case by the FBI and by Democrats because they didn't want the information getting out there Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Union was determined to make the information available to the public and President Trump of course cleared it just today and sent it over to the house now I'm rapidly updating my Twitter to see if there they're actually releasing the full text at this point they've only released excerpts so far so we have not actually seen the the full thing we're also going to find out whether there is whether there's a democratic response to the memo right we're going to find out what the Democratic response had to say because they're of course saying that all of this is taken out of context I would like to hear how this is taken out of context or how this was gotten wrong so again Fox News Washington Examiner are basically accusing the FBI of the same thing and accusing the DOJ of the same thing and that is essentially colluding with the Hillary Clinton campaign who in essence were working with a source who's relying on the Russians for information about Donald Trump and then they were taking that information to open a FISA warrant on Carter page so if this is the centerpiece what does that mean what does that mean well it could mean one of two things it could mean that the entire Trump Russia collusion thing was based on a lie put out by the Hillary Clinton campaign or bad info put out by the Hillary Clinton campaign and therefore fruit of the poisonous tree the entire Russian collusion scandal was a bunch of nonsense from the very beginning and that this entire investigation has been a sham and a fraud perpetrated at the highest levels of the American government by the Obama administration the Hillary Clinton campaign the DOJ and the FBI right that is observation number one or it could be that after the FISA warrant was actually gotten on Carter page it turns out there was other information that came up and that other information lent credibility to the idea that there was some sort of collusion going on like for example the Donald Trump jr. meeting in Trump Tower with a Russian lawyer the letters between Donald Trump jr. the emails between Donald Trump jr. and a Russian PR guy saying that the Russian government was trying to help out Donald Trump jr. it does cast a new light on a lot of this idiot it makes some of the conspiracy theories about meetings like that a little bit more I would say easy to swallow and one of the conspiracy theories of that fusion GPS which was working with the Russian lawyers who were who were meeting with Donald Trump jr. that fusion GPS set this up as sort of a sting operation I always thought that was a bit exaggerated didn't maybe it's not exaggerated as much as I thought so all of this could be an excuse for Donald Trump's start firing people it is quite possible that Donald Trump just starts firing people that he ends the Muller investigation on the back of this and that the the President of the United States litt says listen this whole thing was tainted from the very beginning noting that the investigation comes up with can be true because originally this is based on bad information from Hillary we don't know the extent to which the DOJ and the FBI were colluding with the Hillary Clinton campaign to get Donald Trump during the campaign and in their form in a fire everybody I think that it's gonna take a few more steps to get there so Paul Ryan was yesterday he of course has seen the memo already had been circulated in the house he says that the memo is filled with some bad stuff but that doesn't mean the mother should be fired or abused then that needs to come to light so that that doesn't happen again what this is not is an indictment on our institutions of our justice system this memo is not indictment of the FBI of the Department of Justice it does not impugn the Moller investigation or the Deputy Attorney General what it is is the Congress's legitimate function of oversight to make sure that the FISA process is being used correctly and that if it wasn't being used correctly that needs to come to light and people need to be held accountable so that we do not have problems in the again because this does infect our civil liberties okay so does Trump now fire everyone this permanent fire everyone that's the big question that's going to be asked next and we will get to that in just a second first I want to say thank you to our sponsors over at legacy box so

Declassified Congress will do whatever they're going to do but I think it's a disgrace what's happening in our country and when you look at that and you see that and some of the other things what's going on a lot of people should be ashamed of themselves and much worse than that so I sent it over to Congress and they will do what they are going to do whatever they do is find it was Declassified and let's see what happens but a lot of people should be ashamed thank you very much okay so you know the president was also asked about what should happen to the should happen to rod Rosenstein who's the Deputy Attorney General who was working in the in in the in the DOJ at the time that all this happened and and he said that he had no answers on that that he was not going to talk about what would happen in rod Rosenstein so the real question here is now does Trump start firing everybody saying the entire thing was a ruse from the beginning now as I say it there now we're down to two possibilities right we're down to two possibilities one is if the memo is accurate and if it is not exaggerated if it's not taken out of context if it's not lying we haven't seen any of the underlying applications or materials which Trump could declassify but has not if let's say that that was the centerpiece of Trump Russia collusion that's all they had was this FISA warrant on Carter page and this Russian dossier that in essence all this is gonna come down to is the dossier then I think Trump has an excuse to say listen we're done here okay there's nothing happening here there's nothing for me to obstruct I've been saying all along I'm innocent and for me to just go to James Comey and say why don't you say I'm innocent James Comey wouldn't do it and so I fired him that's not obstruction of justice because I'm innocent there's nothing for me to obstruct I'm not destroying documents I'm not going out of my way to shut down an investigation there literally is nothing here and this memo shows there's nothing here question that that's possibility number one possibility number two is a little bit different and that is as I've said there's other information that there's other information that suggests that the Trump Russia collusion thing is real right again that that Donald Trump jr. meeting at the at the Trump Tower or maybe there's information that we haven't heard about yet so we'll find out in short order because the Democrats I'm sure will respond to this the FBI will start leaking materials and we'll find out whether Devin Nunez memo is just partisan hackery on behalf of the Trump administration in order to shut down the Malheur investigation or whether it is something else entirely okay but but bottom line is here's what it looks like Barack Obama's DOJ spied on his political opponent that's that's really what it looks like here now Chuck Todd is complaining because so far we've only seen excerpts and those excerpts have been leaked to from the media outlets like the Washington Examiner and Fox News I'm desperately trying to load the memo right now and it's crashed the House website because our government sucks at everything so they can't even put up a damn memo so we can actually read the memo but when people run around this weekend with their hair on fire I think there's a reason for people to run around again this opens up a whole can of worms why did the FBI and DOJ try to hide this from Congress number one they were subpoenaed in order to get this material why did they hide it from Congress number two why were Democrats trying to shut down the memo what exactly I assume they'll come out today and talk about which parts of this were out of context but we haven't heard exactly what was out of context yet if nothing was out of context this is really bad number three and what other information if any was use to get that five more on time Carter page I said they're just a bunch of questions that are unanswered here and the reason that I'm hesitating is because I really don't want to I really don't want to say anything out of line about what exactly has happened so here here it is okay so finally we are now we are now getting this to load it's really hard to do this in real time when the when the house website is down we're trying to load desperately the actual memo so I can read the text of it to you okay so here it is purpose this memorandum provides members an update on significant facts relating to the committee's ongoing investigation into the Department of Justice and Federal Bureau of Investigation and their use of foreign intelligence surveillance act during the 2016 presidential election cycle our findings which are detailed below raise concerns with the legitimacy and legality of certain DOJ and FBI interactions with the FISA Court and represent a troubling breakdown of legal is established to protect the American people from abuse is related to the FISA process so now they they go right into it on October 21st 2016 the DOJ and FBI sought and received a FISA probable cause order authorizing electronic surveillance on Carter page from the FISA Court pages a US citizen who served as volunteer adviser to the Trump presidential campaign consistent with requirements under FISA the application first had to be certified by the director or deputy director of the FBI and then required the approval of the Attorney General Deputy Attorney General that I've been rod Rosenstein or the Senate controlled confirmed the assistant attorney general for the National Security Division the FBI and DOJ obtained one initial FISA warrant targeting Carter page and three fives of renewals from the FI FIS see that's the FISA Court as required by statute a FISA order on an American citizen must be renewed by the FISA Court every 90 days and each renewal requires a separate finding of probable cause then director James Comey signed three FISA applications in question on behalf of the FBI deputy director Andrew McCabe signed one then da da Jie that's a director the Deputy Attorney General Sally Yates and then Acting Deputy Attorney General attainable Entei and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein each signed one or more five say applications on behalf of the DOJ due to the sensitive nature of foreign intelligence activity FISA submissions including renewals before the FISC are classified as such the public's confidence in the integrity of the FISA process depends on the courts ability to hold the government to the highest standard particularly as it relates to the surveillance of American citizens however the courts rigor in protecting the rights of Americans reinforced by 90-day renewals of surveillance orders is necessarily dependent on the government's production to the court of all material and relevant facts this should include information potentially favorable to the target of the FISA application that is known by the government in the case of Carter page the government had at least four independent opportunities before the court to accurately provide an accounting of the relevant facts however our findings indicate that as described below material and relevant information was emitted okay so what they're saying is that the FBI and the DOJ essentially lied by omission to the FISA Court okay number one the dossier compiled by Christopher steel the steel dossier on behalf of the Democratic National Committee and the Hillary Clinton campaign formed an essential part of the Carter page 5s application steel was a longtime FBI source who was paid over $160,000 by DNC and Clinton campaign bein lawfirm perkins coie and research firm fusion gps to obtain derogatory information on donald trump's ties to russia neither the initial application in october 2016 nor any of the renewals disclosed or reference the role of the DNC clinton campaign or any party or campaign in funding steele efforts even though the political origins of the steel dossier were then known to senior DOJ and FBI officials the initial FISA application notes Steele was working for a named us person but does not name fusion GPS or principal Glenn Simpson who was paid by US law firm representing the DNC even though that was known by the DOJ at the time the application does not mention steel was ultimately working on behalf of them and paid for by the DNC and Clinton campaign or the FBI had separately authorized payments to steel for the same information so that's the big point here right is that the the dossier was the basis for the FISA warrant and that was the basis for launching the entire investigation to the Carter page FISA application also cited extensively a September 23rd 2016 Yahoo News article by Michael Isikoff which focuses on pages July 2016 trip to Moscow this article does not corroborate the steel dossier because it is derived from information leaked by Steele himself to Yahoo News the page FISA application incorrectly assesses that still did not directly provide information to Yahoo News Steel has admitted in British Court filings he met with Yahoo News and several other outlets in September 2016 at the direction of fusion gps perkins coie was aware of Steele's initial media context because they hosted at least one meeting in washington DC in 2016 with steel infusion gps where this matter was discussed so they're knocking down the assumption that there was other information used for the carter page warrant right because the carter page application originally included this yahoo news article by Michael Isikoff but that was coming from the same place namely Christopher steel steel was suspended and then terminated as an FBI source for what the FBI defines the most serious of violations an unauthorized disclosure to the media of his relationship with the FBI then on October 30th 2016 Mother Jones article by David corn Steele should have been terminated for his previous undisclosed contact with Yahoo and other outlets in September before the FISA application before the was it before the page application was sent to the court in October but still improperly concealed from and lied to the FBI about those contacts so they're now suggesting when Steele should be prosecuted for lying to the FBI Steele's numerous encounters with the media by the cardinal rule of source handling maintaining confidentiality and demonstrated that steel had become a less than reliable source for the FBI before and after steel was terminated as a source he maintained contact with the DOJ via then associate Deputy Attorney General Bruce or a senior DOJ official who works closely with Deputy Attorneys General y 8m later Rosenstein shortly after the election the FBI began interviewing or documenting his communications with steel for example in September 2016 I'm reading directly from this fabled four page memo put out by Devin Nunes Steele admitted to or his feelings against then-candidate Trump when Steele said he was quote desperate that Donald Trump not get elected and was passionate about him about not being president now there she waits to read that one Steele thought that Trump was actually in bed with the Russians and didn't want him to be President or two he hated Trump and therefore trumped up all this stuff against Trump this clear evidence of Steele's bias was recorded by or at the time and subsequently an official FBI files been not reflected in any of the page FISA applications during the same period or his wife this is a Deputy Attorney General was employed by fusion GPS to assist in the cultivation of opposition research on Trump or later provided the FBI with all of his wife's Apple research paid for by the DNC and Clinton campaign via effusion GPS the Orr's relationship with steel and fusion gps was inexplicably concealed from the FISA Court so all of this smells terrible all of this is super super dirty stuff and in just a second we're going to go through the rest of the memo and we're gonna get Trump's reaction to all of this it sounds like he's preparing for mass firings so things are about to heat up in a serious way we'll get to all of that in just one second first I want to say thank you to our sponsors over at helix sleep so if you're losing sleep lately then you may need to catch up over the weekend because let's

mattress on the market helix sleep comm slash been check it out right now okay back to back to the steel dossier memo back to the Stefan Nunez memo that is that is blowing up the internet right now it actually shut down the government website so here's what it says so we've already established according to this memo a couple of things one we have established that the FISA warrant originally taken out on Trump campaign member Carter page was taken out based on a dossier compiled by Christopher Steele on behalf of the DNC that information was never revealed to the FISA Court there was apparently no other confirming information that was used we also know now that Steele had an agenda against Trump and openly admitted such and that he worked with the Deputy Attorney General whose wife was busy compiling this information on behalf of the DNC and the Hillary campaign for fusion GPS the memo continues according to the head of the FBI's counterintelligence division assistant director Bill pre step corroboration of the steel dossier was in its infancy at the time of the initial fit page FISA application after Steele was terminated a source validation report conducted by an independent unit within FBI assess seals reporting has only minimally corroborated in early 2017 director Comey briefed the president elect Trump on a summary of the steel dossier even though it was according to his June 2017 testimony salacious and unverified while the FISA application relied on Steele's past record of credible reporting on other unrelated matters it ignored or concealed his anti-trump financial and ideological motivations furthermore Deputy Director McCabe testified before the committee in December 2017 that no surveillance warrant would have been sought from the FISA Court without the steal dossier information so that's an amazing admission by McCabe that the steel dossier was the only thing that allowed this investigation to start and then we conclude the FISA the page FISA application also mentions information regarding fellow Trump campaign adviser George papadopolis but there is no evidence of any cooperation or conspiracy between page and Papadopoulos the Papadopoulos information triggering the opening of an FBI counterintelligence in vest in late july 2016 by FBI agent Peter struck struck was reassigned by the special counsels office to FBI Human Resources for improper text messages with his mistress FBI attorney Lisa page no known relation to Carter page where they both demonstrated a clear bias against Trump and in favor of Clinton whom struck had also investigated the struck Lisa page texts also reflect extensive discussions about the investigations orchestrating leaks to the media and include a meeting with deputy director McCabe to discuss an insurance policy against president Trump's election okay that is the end of the memo so the bottom line is if you think that the newness memo covers everything I mean this is my sure I'm reading this in real time so here's my real-time tank if you think that the Nunez memo is the completion is the is the entirety of all of the information in the trump Kalu Russia collusion case then the whole thing is not only a empty vessel it is a sting operation by the Clinton operation working in cahoots with the FBI and the DOJ if there is nothing else there if they can show nothing else there and all this obstruction stuff all of this Trump firing Comey all of this Trump asking Rosen seeing whose side he was on all of this seems to fall by the wayside because let's face it if there's nothing there and Trump is saying there's nothing there why won't you guys side with me that's not the same thing as him attempting to obstruct justice so the memo is in fact a bombshell it's there there is a you know there is something there that that is shocking and also by the way the idea that the idea that the memo in terms of national security which is what Democrats have been proclaiming has been pretty much blown out of the water now that we've seen the memo there's nothing there by the way that we hadn't already supposed when I was asked about why it wasn't when I talked on the show about why the memo what the memo said I speculated the memo said exactly that's right if you go back and listen to the shows I speculated I didn't read the memo then what the memo said was this this was the center of the memo and I said if that's the case how does this endanger national security and yet the Democrats were out there saying this over and over and over like Jeff Merkley the senator from Oregon he came out and he said that if the memo were at least the Intel community would stop talking with the house it also goes to the heart of the manipulation of very sensitive national secrets highly classified information that is given to the Intelligence Committee with the understanding it will not be released in an fashion that in in dangers the United States or in a fashion that manipulates the information for political purposes and so that that understanding goes to the heart of how the committee is able to get sensitive information in the first place why why the government's willing to share it with the committee so this really threatens to blow up the whole contract between the branches of government over sensitive information okay it's just ridiculous that that this was the suggestion first of all the Congress oversees this agency this is not how government works can the intelligence commit and the intelligence community doesn't get to tell Congress to sniff itself the intelligence community is run by Congress rent Congress has oversight power over them so the idea that the intelligence committee will stop sharing is ridiculous James Comey tweeted this yesterday what an insufferable character he's turned out to be here's what James Comey tweeted yesterday saying we should appreciate the FBI speaking up I wish more of our leaders would but take note American history also shows that in the long run weasels and Liars never hold the field so long as good people stand up not a lot of schools or streets named for Joe McCarthy so this isn't about Joe McCarthy at this point this is about you oversaw an FBI that was seeking FISA warrants against American citizens based on shoddy intelligence and you refused to even turn over that information to the FISA Court they couldn't even go they couldn't even do this I mean this is this is insane speaking of insanity no members of the media al Sharpton Chris Matthews they're saying that this turns the Constitution on his but rather this this kills the Constitution it kills the Constitution for the President of the United States to declassify material inside the executive branch like they don't understand the Constitution here's Chris Matthews over an M&E state making that case all right Lee CCG up come on show coming here misunderstand the constitution to make a lot of money ah go but a constitutional crisis somebody it seems to me the Constitution has always been turned on its butt we've got a Congress a chairman of a committee on intelligence which has historically been a bipartisan committee and usually even remembered members and they're basically there to work together and to try to find out if our intelligence committees are doing their job and it's been turned into a tool of a president playing defense okay again turn into a tool the president playing defense that's out I'm seeing from the memo so we'll have to see what the response is from Democrats we'll have to see if they can bring forward more information again the memo doesn't answer everything it doesn't answer why the Donald Trump jr. meeting happened why he was showing willingness to collude with the it doesn't show why George papadopolis was lying to the FBI it doesn't cover everything but it raises some pretty serious questions about how the FISA Court does its business and whether the FBI and DOJ were lying in order to gain a FISA warrant and whether they have an agenda against Trump now again does that necessarily kill them all our investigation probably not but it does set some pretty rigorous questions in front of particularly Deputy Attorney General Rosenstein who went forward with these FISA applications if all they were but remember Carter page has not been indicted right when and when knew all these indictments were about to come down my understanding my thought was that it was going to be Paul manna fort and Mike Flynn and Carter page there's been no indictment of Carter page so as far as we know Carter page was not involved in criminal activity he's just an idiot who wanders around Russia looking for cash right doesn't actually mean that Carter page was a criminal so that means that you launched this entire investigation on the back of it the only guy who hasn't been indicted that we thought would be indicted the man of 14 citement by the way has nothing to do with the Trump campaign the man for tonight Minh has to do with him lying to the FBI the george papadapolis indictment is the only one that has to do with the Trump campaign because he apparently lied to the FBI about meetings that he had in London with a Russian cutout but it's not clear that Papadopoulos was working on behalf of the Trump administration or the Trump campaign Trump campaign basically disowned Papadopoulos in the middle of the campaign so all of this calls into serious question the entire investigation doesn't mean the investigation that should be killed doesn't mean that the entire investigation should die probably not but you know it's also important to know Papadopoulos was the counterintelligence investigation began before the FISA application on page but it was on Papadopoulos so this is an important point right so this is it's it's an important point so again this is this is all weird and somewhat confusing right they've been surveilling they've been surveilling the the members of the of these Trump campaign Carter page had been surveilled by the FISA back in 2014 there a lot of sketch characters working for all of us but Papadopoulos was under investigation first so well there are serious questions to be raised about the the warrant on Carter page I'm trying to set out the timeline in my own head as we go along here Devon Nunez just confirmed the end of the New York Times narrative the Papadopoulos was actually under investigation first and one of the things that the the investigation is covering here is is I want to clarify and I want to backtrack again I'm doing this all in real time so the original FISA application that was taken out against Connor page it's now clear from this from this timeline that that is not what actually launched the investigation because paragraph five let me reread that okay this is the the paragraph five the page FISA application also mentions information regarding fellow Trump campaign adviser George papadopolis the Papadopoulos information triggered the opening of an FBI counterintelligence investigation in late 2016 by FBI agent Peter struck what's interesting about that it sort of buried in there and a little biased and I had to read it twice because I'm getting texts from from lawyers or friends is that if the page fives a application mentioned information regarding Papadopoulos that means that the investigation was already on regarding Papadopoulos so doesn't kill the entire Muller investigation what it does do is call into question how the FBI and the DOJ were pursuing that investigation so that means that there should be serious consequences inside the FBI and the DOJ for their the alacrity with which they sought to go after Carter page but it doesn't necessarily kill the entire investigation so that may be the happy medium that we are coming to here if that is the case then that means that if Trump starts firing people in the Muller investigation that is probably a bad move the so it's it's you know this is it's not a nothing burger but it is also not the end of the Muller investigation okay that may be the the most the the the that may be the best thing I can say now Trump was asked about all he was asked specifically about Rosen Stein and in Trump being asked about Rosenstein said that he may fire him basically thank you very much you you figured that one out okay so he's saying that maybe he'll fire rosin Stein maybe you should fire Rosen Stein possible should you fire Muller over this again if the investigation commenced before Carter page and there's more to the investigation than just Carter Page as I said before so you know there's there's some dirty stuff here but is it everything that is cracked up to be originally on first reading know if they've you're a little bit confused that's okay I'm going to explain again I'm gonna go back and backtrack I'm gonna explain again in just a second you're gonna have to come over to Daley we're calm for all of that for $9.99 a month you can get a subscription to Daley we're calm and that means you can also be part of our mailbag so we're doing our mailbag today which is a

out you just want to listen later SoundCloud iTunes YouTube subscribe there please leave us a review we always appreciate we are the largest fastest-growing conservative podcast in the nation okay so the short summary you got to see my entire thought process as it happened right so here's the short summary of the memo Faiza application on Carter page may have been gotten by ill Gaines Carl page application is not the entirety of the Trump Russia collusion investigation nor was it the launching point of the Trump Russian collusion investigation which means is very hard for Trump to fire Muller and just kill the investigation outright or to say that this is the only thing that was being investigated however it does demonstrate FBI and DOJ working with the Hillary campaign presumably and acting in corrupt fashion particularly with regard to Carter page so is it a scandal yes is it a scandal big enough to blow up the entire muddler investigation of the Trump Russian collusion investigation probably not probably not okay so there you are there is there is the the phone there's the full-on understanding okay so let's do a couple of things that I like and then some things that I hate and then we will get to the mailbag so things that I like I think we need to calm down Susan Bach so we've been doing both pieces all week long this is a piece that you'll know you may not recognize that it's that it is Bach because nobody knows music anymore but it's box maybe most famous piece you probably heard it when you were in church at one point this is about the Jesu joy of man's desiring I'm not calm down now ah okay now that we're all calm okay now we can get back to a calm nice show the world didn't implode everything's gonna be okay hey listen would've been okay anyway uh regardless of how this went back to fact and so we'll have to see how all this plays out but let's get to another thing that I like so I have to play you what I think is the funniest thing that I have seen in a very long time okay there is a a guy who attempted to break into a car and a guy who I'm friendly with Jon Kerley over at Cairo radio in Seattle very nice guy good sportscaster they recorded him doing a play by play the sports play-by-play just in time for the Super Bowl for a guy trying to break into a car and it's pretty spectacular can't break it that's three four if you're counting at home that's 14 blows against the window with the mop now remember the dirty part of the mop is underneath his arm he's got a hat again he strikes the window and now he comes down hard raining blows down upon the window one two three and this is just about tuckered him out he places them up on top of a roof and now he starts to think about whether or not he wants to climb up he places his right foot on top of the wall here he comes at a ball oh my god somebody get some salami and cream cheese and rubbing all over his face he's unconscious on the ground with the mob okay Sports is fantastic I am going the Super Bowl this weekend so I'm very pumped up about that it's first Super Bowl and probably the last Super Bowl I will everything it should be it should be fun okay let's see other things that I like so this is something that you have to you have to like because it's not something I like as much as I feel just terrible for the father here so well there's a father who's three daughters were gymnasts in the US gymnastics program and they were abused by Larry Nance for this human piece of garbage and the father in the courtroom charged Larry Nasser and I just wish I wish that the security had not stopped him because Larry Nasser deserves every bit of brutality that this father can inflict on him no sir I can't you know that I can't do that that's not how our legal okay so you know obviously you wish that this should be part of the justice system I'm all in favor of changing the law so that the the parents of the victims of child molestation get to brutalize the the Trott molesters that seems to me completely just and I'm entirely okay with it okay time for a quick thing that that I hate and then we'll get to the mailbag so the thing that I hate today is politifact so politifact is a left-wing fact-checking organization how do I know that it's left-wing because they don't even fact check the people they use Pfeffer fact-checking so yesterday the released information that Alan Grayson a representative from Florida who is a complete nutjob I mean a complete and utter nutjob thinks Ted Cruz was not eligible to be President compared the Tea Party to the KKK he's just he's a complete crazy person he has attacked a reporter I mean like here's an actual Mille video of him attempting to go after a reporter now people know going forward that simply showing up to a public event means that you come and hassle me you're again in my face that gives you the right to push me you pushed me sir you pushed me no I was standing there and you pushed no I'm sorry I think what million well that's right and that's a good thing I'll be hand that over to the Capitol police my friend is getting from the reporter arrested assaulting you for a few questions no no not for asked me these questions for getting in my face and being a fool and pushing me as I was trying to be the severe sister why did the grab swipe audacity is making these allegations I mean he's a crazy person Alan Grayson so politifact hired this idiot to actually be a fact checker for then he was gonna be the voice of the people they heard a Republican congressman is anti Trump and they hired Alan Grayson to be the fact checkers for politifact and then they had to fire him later that afternoon when it came out as everyone who follows politics even minutely knows that he is a complete nut bag okay so just demonstrates the politifact isn't all that it's cracked up to be pretty pretty astonishing okay time for the mailbag so let's do this thing okay Patrick says hi then can you explain the situation with the Pfizer scandal Devon Nunez in the FBI so this time back to the Russia probe if so help I hear a lot about it in the news but the issue is murky to me so we spent most of the show explaining this but here is the brief story okay the FISA scandal basically here's the deal the suggestion well Devon Nunez put out a four-page memo the memo came out today we just read it in its entirety the memo basically suggests that a FISA warrant was gotten on a US citizen Carter page was a member of the Trump campaign and was gotten at the behest of the Hillary campaign it was he gotten at the behest of the Hillary Clinton campaign working through fusion GPS and that the DOJ and the FBI basically took a piece of Oppo research put together by Hillary Clinton and then use that as a basis to surveil Trump now the implication is that this is sort of the the poisonous tree the root of the poisonous tree and that should destroy the entire mall or Russia and collusion investigation that apparently is not true the noonas memo includes sort of buried in there the information that suggests that the investigation predated the Carter page FISA warrant issue so two things can be true ones the five FBI and DOJ could be corrupt the FBI and DOJ could've been working with Hillary Clinton on the Carter page thing and it is also possible but the investigation is more than just Carter page and that this doesn't kill the investigation but that's that's the really short story here okay Christopher Martin says well it is obvious the Democrats have painted themselves into an ideological corner with regard to the president do you see an opportunity for them to seek common ground with Republicans in Congress I think it's highly unlikely because any common ground they find with Republicans in Congress will end up being common ground with Trump they've obviously decided they would rather not legalize 1.8 million illegal immigrants then even conceive of making some sort of deal with Trump so that's sort of an astonishing political move on their part because yeah Trump either is gonna pass good proposals or he won't he's unable to pass good proposals because Democrats stymie it and he puts forward a bunch of you know friendly bipartisan proposals and Democrats just keep pushing back it's not gonna reach down to their benefit JC says dear mr. Shapiro I'm a South African citizen recently immigrated to the United States because I like you believe America is the greatest experiment in human history my question is regarding the latest Republican immigration proposal especially as it relates to chain migration since I like you believe in limited government and the people should rely on their family friends and local churches for help how does it make any sense to forbid people from bringing their family with them the current system demands the person sponsoring their family member has to be financially capable of supporting said family member could we not simply create a means by which we limit the amount of government assisted immigrants can obtain rather than simply banishing them from coming at all sure I mean I'd be very much in favor of that I mean I do think that the idea of limiting government assistance to immigrants ensuring that they are culturally assimilated then I'm fine with open immigration I don't have a problem with the number of people coming in I think that a lot of people like Tom cotton and Jeff Sessions have made the case that hurts the country economically to bring in new people who want to work I don't think that's the case at all by any stretch of the imagination Joshua asks what do you think Bach or Mozart would think of big band jazz you know hard to hard to get in their heads I think they would be confused by it well there's not a lot can't appoint in big band jazz they probably think that it was relatively rudimentary because it is I mean when you compared to classical music big band jazz is relatively rudimentary but that said I think that they would enjoy the work of Gershwin probably because Gershwin is is creative and also has classical temperament I enjoy big-band jazz by the way but it is a simplified version of music I mean it's a simplified form of classical music I said whether they may have been impressed by the emotion of big-band jazz but they certainly would have been impressed by the intellect and big-band jazz even though I enjoyed Corey says hello Ben it seems you're always busy producing content is procrastination something you've ever dealt with that if so can you give advice for those that currently struggling so I'm not by nature a procrastinator I tend to think I'm very good at delayed gratification so I tend to think that if I get something done now I won't have to deal with it later but here's my suggestion it's sort of the same as Dave Ramsey's suggestion about that do the little things first make a list of the things that you want to get done and then take the things that are easiest to do and strike those off the list first so you feel like you have momentum because you start with a really big thing you're gonna want to put that off because it's too intimidating but if you knock all the little things off your list you'll actually get them done so that that's the easiest way to avoid procrastination Cody says habit my wife and I are huge fans has evangelical Christians we really appreciate your stance on abortion we're wondering what the likelihood of roe v wade ever being repealed would be and what it would take to do so well takes five votes for roe v wade to be repealed that would not in fact make abortion illegal across the nation it would just say that states have the capacity to pass laws on abortion right so that's the idea so the idea that that roe v wade goes away and suddenly abortions illegal across the country that's not correct in California it would stay illegal in New York it would stay legal in Massachusetts too and stay legal in Alabama it would suddenly become illegal Emanuel says this week you've been reviewing classical composers and music are there modern musical composers that you know or like I don't I'll be honest with you I don't know a lot of modern classical composers the ones that I've heard like Philip Glass and John gage are less than impressive to me I don't enjoy their music very much it seems to me that most of the good classical music is actually being written for film at this point you know if you listen to the scores of Elmer Bernstein or Jerry Goldsmith or if you listen to the scores of John Williams then you're listening to some some pretty solid classical music actually just used in dramatic fashion more romantic period certainly than classical period music the guy can't remember the name of the guy who wrote the score to How to Train Your Dragon that's a great score with some terrific music alright Clayton says dear men's seeker of facts destroyer of feelings I like that I've been hearing a lot about Chelsea Manning's attempt to run for Senate this puzzles me because according to the third section of the 14th amendment he can't the third section has barred a man named Victor Berger from his congressional seat for violating the Espionage Act the self same accident Manning himself committed is it it is worth noting that Bergman was acquitted dude biases of the judge on the trial against him lastly I don't think the sentence commutation would save him as the amendment states that only Congress can absolve you fun facts only two people have been absolved Jefferson Davis and robert e lee can this be used to block his run so off the top of my head and my answer is no simply because i believe that there are other there are other considerations as far as state considerations that come into account not just the constitutional issue you know so you know i want to do a little bit more research on that newsweek suggests at least that chelsea manning is capable of running so the reason for that apparently is that the constitution allows you as citizens who have a criminal record run for congress but state laws can be different the only qualifications to run for US senate is you have to be 30 years old to have citizenship in the u.s. for at least nine years live in the state at the time of the election it does not state on their website anyone who has a criminal record can't run for US Senate so I wonder if this other case Victor burger it was barred by state law so I'd have to have to check it out Daniel says I'm stuck between two worlds I've been going to school for music but I have a passion for writing philosophy and history as well how do i reconcile the artistic with the political well I don't think that you necessarily have to reconcile them but what I would suggest is that the same the same natural law that undergirds a belief in reason as as making possible the discovery of higher truths makes possible the discovery of better music so this is a view that was held by Bach and Cuba held by Beethoven how by Mozart held by Brahms the idea there are natural laws to the human ear natural laws to the human mind that makes certain music better than other music on an objective level I think that is true and I think that is also true in philosophy and history as well also I think that you know one of the beautiful things about the way that our current free-market system works is that if you became a very prominent musician suddenly people actually care about your opinion I mean released years they're supposed to according to the Grammys James says dear Ben what is your view on gene altering I'm concerned that technology like CRISPR is going to expand beyond foundations of medicine from treatment to intentional body modifications examples of normal muscle growth for sports or possibly genetic sex changes or live extensions or physical characteristics what is altering your god-inspired vessel all that my view is that if you are correcting a flaw that is one thing if you are simply trying to better yourself through genetics that's another I think that that carries serious risks yeah essentially eugenics Brad says I want to learn about it is real what book can I read not just old history but modern as well now the one that I recommend for people is book by a guy named Jay Eli bard he's the editor called myths and facts about Israel it's 300 pages but they're each kind of bite-sized questions it's a bunch of questions that are answered about Israel Benjamin Netanyahu back in the 90s wrote a book called the durable a durable peace which is quite good about the history of Israel and how modern Israel operates today Colin says I'm a Christian philosopher so I obviously interact a lot with the question of God's existence and the arguments for and against his existence you mentioned his speech once you found some of the atheist arguments quite compelling if so which arguments why and why then aren't you an atheist and beyond that what convinces you that God exists just being devil's advocate so the argument for atheism is that there is no free will we are just balls of flesh wandering through the universe I don't find that completely implausible that's a possibility I'm not gonna pretend that atheism isn't a possibility I will suggest that I find it not more plausible than the explanation that we have free will we are capable of changing in our own lives that our action is in our own hands that we are endowed with reason that that extends beyond just neuronal firing that I think is a more compelling case so what I'm suggesting is that belief in God does not have to be certainty to be probability and so I believe that God exists and that he controls the universe is involved in our lives and that he is handed to us a set of precepts that help guide our lives and make better civilization one of the reasons for that is almost utilitarian which is that the only great civilization in the history of the world in my viewpoint is the judeo-christian civilization springing from those foundations but the Atheist argument which is that basically everything happened through accident I don't find it supremely compelling but I find it at least plausible I mean it's a plausible the idea that the universe is eternal that we've gone through a billion iterations of the universe that eventually we hit on the that eventually we hit on the universe that we currently live in and that just because it's improbable that we exist in the way that we do doesn't mean that it's really improbably when you repeat the game a bunch of times Zack says - which of the arguments for God's existence is your favorite the ontological like Knowles the unmoved mover argument of Aristotle and Aquinas the moral argument of Conte well I would suggest that the I find the the Aristotelian Aquinas argument the best on the ontological argument I don't find quite as compelling the argument you know the the ontological argument is usually expressed as st. Anselm said that if you can imagine God that God therefore must exist that's the this sort of very simplified and non correct version for the unstructured ontological argument now the Aquinas argument which is that in the infinite regress of causes has to terminate in a first cause and unmoved mover or at least an unnatural eyes day actualize er I find that a compelling rational explanation of why things exist the way that they do and I also think that if you believe that as contests I like the content argument as well the content argument suggesting that we have an innate moral sense and that was placed by something like God I think that that is I think that's right but the only argument that actually gets you to a God who is perfect good and all mowing is the Aquinas argument not necessarily the content argument Henry says hey Ben what was it like being on South Jordan Peterson thoughts on him as a person as an intellectual I really like Jordan I mean I think that Jordan is a very mild-mannered guy who is constantly thinking and it's something that I appreciate he's constantly asking questions and learning I really like him and there's a whole group of folks with whom I may disagree on substantial issues that I like personally because I think that they are interested in asking questions and like talking about facts and first principles to me that's the that's the mark of somebody who's interesting to talk to somebody who likes talking for his principles so for example I've you know criticized Sam Harris's views because I disagree with him I really like Sam I think Sam is a good guy Eric Weinstein is somebody who I disagree with but I have fun talking to him because we can talk for his principles and examine each other's thoughts and make them sharper I really enjoy that I think Jordan is one of those people Alexander says Ben you were constantly ripping on different pop songs which pop song or singer is your guilty pleasure well I mean I don't really have one as far as a pop song or singer there was one song that came out recently that the the name escapes me that for some reason I find particularly catchy I'll look it up and I'll play it next week to humiliate well okay so that one is actually catchy songs I praise that on the show as a catchy song there's also why I don't remember the lyric to it I'll have to look it up but it's it's it's playing through my head right now it did a little bump um deadly dun dun dun dun catchy song so there are some of these songs that are catchy but I don't remember who did them nor do I care Toby says Ben what is gonna happen in the last season of Game of Thrones what's gonna happen in the last season of Game of Thrones that they're going to all decide on a democracy that has led by Tyrion after Danny dies she's gonna be cast as the all-perfect all-knowing all-wise person she's gonna end up dying and then they're gonna have to come up with a democracy we already know this because they've hinted at it it's really boring I'm shocked the last season they had Tyrion openly hint that to Danny like they're about to go into battle he's like what if we formed a democracy come on okay so like I like democracy and all but this is a game of Thrones okay it's not the game of destroying the Thrones we're gonna break the chain we're gonna break - well yes I understand you're foreshadowing this for seven seasons all right Taylor says dear Ben my brother just graduated Marine Corps boot camp and is now as an infantry he's an honorable Christian young man who joined from love of country in the country and the values she didn't shrines I think he's recently realized this choice meant one day caused him to take a life and he has expressed he doesn't want to kill well I'll just say to those who have the courage to serve but struggle with taking another's life I mean what I would suggest is that I mean if you're joining the military and you're joining a line of work that involves possibly killing people that that's a serious consideration you know obviously I think that there are people who need to be killed I think terrorists need to be killed I think that there are Isis members who need to die and I don't think that the Bible suggests that the word is do not murder it's right it's it's not don't kill there are two separate words is low-tier talk right which means do not murder the word for kill in Hebrew is Tahar oh this is it would be low-tide rogue if they didn't want you to kill Patrick says Haven I figure you have a pretty negative view of prostitution in pornography give me a general sentiment that people should generally be left alone how do we balance the laws concerning these activities and leaving people alone to do what they will so public pornography public displays of pornography I think can be regulated because you're talking and they're about things that affect the community they have externalities prostitution is is another thing that affects public commerce I tend to be in favor of legalization of prostitution you know leaving aside the exploitation of women which of course should be illegal that said my feeling is that a social board work is necessary and that law is that if if law is the only bulwark between you and the abyss then law is not going to save you okay we will be back here next to one more one more Kate says my fiance and I can't pick a honeymoon location suggestions so the places that I love Hawaii Hawaii is just fantastic and it's also relatively affordable if you can afford it Italy is fantastic honeymoon location Italy is just phenomenal France is great you know I love Israel as well I think is really fantastic but if you just want a relaxed place you're just gonna go and lie back and not have to rush around seeing things then Hawaii is the place to be Hawaii's just spectacular and I would suggest the island of Maui I've been to most of the islands at this point Maui is is I think the nicest all right so we will be back here next week with all of the fallout from memo Gay 2018 I'm Ben Shapiro this is the Ben Shapiro show the Ben Shapiro show is produced by Mathis Glover executive producer Jeremy boring senior producer Jonathan hey our technical producer is Austin Stevens edited by Alex and Garo audio is mixed by Mike Carmina hair and makeup is by Jesuit Oliveira the Ben Shapiro show is a daily wire for word publishing production copyright for publishing 2018
