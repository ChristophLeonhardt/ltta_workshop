“Three, two, one …
Go ahead.
O.K.”
My name is Eva Schloss.
Would you like to ask me some
questions about my life?
“Why don’t you ask me a
question about Auschwitz?"
Why don’t you ask me a
question about Auschwitz?
Everybody said, Never
again, Auschwitz.
We have learned our lesson.”
But it looked bad
again in the world.
The hatred, discrimination.
So I thought it
really necessary
to teach and to
speak about it.
“My name is Pinchas Gutter.
I will answer any questions
you might have for me."
“How old were you
when the war ended?"
“I was between the
ages of 13 and 14
when the war ended in 1945."
But he doesn’t
move much, really.
And that’s his choice.
But it’s very Jewish to
talk with your hands.
Yes, it is.
And you should feel
comfortable to do.
And you can.
Exactly.
Yeah.
It’s going to be somewhat
normal in a hundred years’
time to have a person
sitting in this position.
And it won’t seem
as unnatural.
When you start to get
into the questions
and you start to
get into the dialog,
you kind of lose
sight of the fact
that the person’s
not actually there.
Gosh.
My goodness.
This is Andrew.
Yes.
Hi, Andrew.
Nice to meet you.
Nice to meet you.
Lisa.
This is Lisa, her
granddaughter.
Right now, there’s about a
hundred cameras on the stage.
So we’re recording
everything in all directions.
The idea behind the
green is that we can then
take out the green and replace
it with any other environment
that you’re going to be
talking in the future.
So this could be a classroom.
It could be a museum.
We could put those
backdrops behind you.
In the beginning, I didn’t
know really how to speak.
You know, I’m saying
you have to learn.
Eventually, I
found my own voice.
O.K., here we go.
Good morning.
Good morning.
How are you?
I’m feeling very well
A little nervous.
O.K. When did you first
start telling your story?
Since 1986, I started to
speak for the first time.
And I haven’t really
stopped since.
“Today is October
the 9th, 1996.
The survivor being
interviewed is Eva Schloss.
Maiden name Geiringer."
I realized suddenly that
people are interested
and people do want
to know about it.
And this was really, a big
turning point in my life.
This is a repeat after me.
“My name is Eva Schloss, and
I’m a Holocaust survivor."
My name is Eva Schloss.
I’m a Holocaust survivor.
“I’m actually a
recording, so I
can’t answer that question."
I’m actually a recording.
I can’t answer that question.
“I don’t remember."
I don’t remember.
“Maybe you should
try to reboot."
Maybe you should try to —
Reboot.
Rebook?
Reboot.
Reboo—
O.K., never mind.
Too technical for me.
I don’t quite imagine how
people will feel about that,
to pretend it is
somebody really speaking
to them who lived in that
time 30 or 50 years ago.
How did it feel to wear
the yellow star, Eva?
I was quite a stubborn
child, and I didn’t
want to wear the yellow star.
I didn’t see why
that was necessary.
And I had a big
fight with my mother.
I didn’t want to, but my
mother explained to me very,
very carefully
and thoroughly why
it was dangerous
not to wear it.
Can I just tell you,
these answers are great.
They’re just the right
length with the right amount
of details.
Wonderful.
Thank you.
What happened when you
arrived at Auschwitz?
Men and women were separated.
So people clinged to
each other, cried.
And really, really horrible.
And they guards came
and beat us apart.
And my father took me
by the hand and said,
Eva, dear, God
will protect you.
I often think of actors who
do every day the same story.
I vary it because if I
would do the same thing all
the time, then I might
get fed up with it.
Have you come up with a
name for the contraption
that you’re in yet?
Cage.
The cage?
O.K.
Big cage.
So describe to us as the
most emotional situation
that you had to face while you
were in Auschwitz-Birkenau.
I think the biggest
shock I experienced
was when I saw my naked mother
walking out of this barrack,
knowing that she was
going to be gassed.
I think that was the hardest
moment I experienced.
And was she?
She was saved, and
we were reunited.
And she lived for a long,
long time till 93 years old.
I’d always seen it
in front of my eyes.
So I lived with it, really.
You know?
I saw the inside of the cattle
truck where we were moved.
I saw the arrival
in Auschwitz.
I saw everything.
At night especially,
when I was not busy.
You know, all those
images came back
till I started to
speak about it.
Then, I could let go.
O.K., this is over here.
Right here.
These are the gas chambers
over here in this area.
And these are the
forests around here.
Yeah.
The pond where you would
have gone to get water
is all around this area here.
How does it make you
feel looking at that?
Very confused because
when you were inside,
you had no idea —
Of how big it was
around it, yeah.
And where, and what, and how
things were connected to it.
Yeah, exactly.
And even when
I was there now,
I was completely disoriented.
There’s not a day goes by when
I am not thinking about them
in one way or another.
I wasn’t coping at
all after the war.
And it was Otto Frank who came
very often to our house who
saw how I was suffering, and
he really helped me a lot.
I don’t think I ever
replaced Anna for him.
I personally had the
feeling very often,
but that he never, ever made
me really, really think that.
But I just felt, that
when he looked at me,
I always thought,
is he thinking,
why did this child survive
and why not my own daughter?
Do you remember how
you felt about Anne
after you read the diary?
I must say, I wasn’t
particularly interested in it
at first.
Why not?
I was much too busy to
cope with my own grief.
Anna frank says in her
diary when she dies,
she would like to live on.
Meaning she wants
to become immortal.
And she has succeeded."
How did your daughters cope
with having two parents who
both experienced trauma?
As soon as they were
teenagers and older,
and started to know
more about our history,
I think they had
difficulties to cope with it.
To accept it.
She told us
anecdotes and stories,
but it was almost like it was
someone else’s experiences,
not her own.
There was a
certain time where
she didn’t want to talk about
it and was protecting us.
Our whole generation
has been uprooted.
And as a result of the
experiences through which
all of us have gone, we have
some psychological problems.
All of us, of one
kind or another.
And our anchor
to the future is
our children and
grandchildren,
which hopefully we’ll
find back into normality.
Great day.
Great day.
You’re going to
miss us, though.
Say I miss it?"
Yeah, you’re
going to miss it.
I’m not so sure.
That’s a wrap.
Woo!
Bravo! Bravo!
So, back to normality.
Normality.
Although, you still picked
to wear gray silver.
Yeah.
I can’t go right into a
color after all this.
Yeah.
You need to ease
yourself back to color?
See you.
Say goodbye to the studio.
You didn’t say
goodbye to the cage.
No.
Here we go.
Usually, twice a week,
I go out speaking.
I said to my
daughters, who think
I don’t have to do all this,
I need it for my sanity.
Too hot?
Uh-uh.
I got over it, the suffering.
The only thing what I still
don’t get over really,
and I don’t think I
ever will, is the loss.
This project will
almost immortalize her,
so that she can go on
telling the story once she’s
no longer with us.
But it is still
a story, really.
It’s what it is.
Unless you live through it,
you can’t fully identify.
I hope you don’t forget
what you’ve heard here today.
Goodbye.
