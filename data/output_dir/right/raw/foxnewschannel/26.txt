91
00:02:21,378 --> 00:02:23,312
WORSE THAN THAT.

SIDE YOU'RE ON?

119
00:03:06,623 --> 00:03:07,523
EVERYBODY CONDEMNS IT AND THESE

120
00:03:07,524 --> 00:03:08,891
PEOPLE DESERVE TO BE IN JAIL FOR

121
00:03:08,892 --> 00:03:10,393
A VERY LONG TIME AND THIS

122
00:03:10,394 --> 00:03:11,794

DIATRIBES THE CNN WENT ON TODAY

NETWORKS WENT ON TODAY AND THEY

129
00:03:20,771 --> 00:03:23,973
JUST FURTHER DEEPEN THE DIVIDE

130
00:03:23,974 --> 00:03:25,808
THAT THIS HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH

131
00:03:25,809 --> 00:03:29,211

132

RIGHTFULLY, CALLS OUT FAKE NEWS.

135
00:03:35,052 --> 00:03:36,719
WE HAVE WATCHED THROUGH THE

136
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:37,787
YEARS COME BEYOND TWO YEARS IF

137
00:03:37,788 --> 00:03:39,789
YOU TAKE THE ELECTION INTO

138
00:03:39,790 --> 00:03:41,924
ACCOUNT THAT EVERY SECOND, EVERY

139
00:03:41,925 --> 00:03:44,093
MINUTE, EVERY HOUR OF EVERY DAY

140
00:03:44,094 --> 00:03:46,395
THEY JUST TRASH YOUR FATHER, SAY

141
00:03:46,396 --> 00:03:50,232
ANYTHING THEY WANT TO SAY AND

142
00:03:50,233 --> 00:03:52,401
THEN WHEN THEY GET CALLED OUT --

143
00:03:52,402 --> 00:03:53,202
FOR EXAMPLE THEY ALWAYS GIVE

144
00:03:53,203 --> 00:03:53,736
HILLARY A PASS.

145
00:03:53,737 --> 00:03:55,805
THEY GAVE OBAMA A PASS.

146
00:03:55,806 --> 00:03:57,540
THEY ARE ATTACKING YOUR FATHER

147
00:03:57,541 --> 00:03:58,441
WITH CONSPIRACY THEORIES AND

148
00:03:58,442 --> 00:04:00,810
LIES ABOUT RUSSIAN FOR TWO YEARS

149
00:04:00,811 --> 00:04:01,811
AND THEY ARE WRONG.

150
00:04:01,812 --> 00:04:03,613
YOUR DAD CALLS THEM OUT FOR

151
00:04:03,614 --> 00:04:05,014
BEING FAKE AND THEY ARE AND

152
00:04:05,015 --> 00:04:07,183
SOMEHOW THEY'RE GOING TO EQUATE

153
00:04:07,184 --> 00:04:10,019
THAT TO A CALL FOR VIOLENCE?

154
00:04:10,020 --> 00:04:11,253
THAT IS TOTAL B.S. AND DAVE GOT

155
00:04:11,254 --> 00:04:13,222
TO KNOW THAT.

156
00:04:13,223 --> 00:04:14,657
>> THERE'S NO QUESTION ABOUT IT.

157
00:04:14,658 --> 00:04:15,658
THEY ARE ALL FOR THE FIRST

158
00:04:15,659 --> 00:04:16,258
AMENDMENT UNTIL YOU SAY

159
00:04:16,259 --> 00:04:17,393
SOMETHING THAT THEY DISAGREE

160
00:04:17,394 --> 00:04:18,728
WITH AND THEN THERE ARE NO

161
00:04:18,728 --> 00:04:20,562
LONGER FOR THE FIRST AMENDMENT.

162
00:04:20,564 --> 00:04:22,398
IT'S WHY TWITTER COMMITS WHY

163
00:04:22,399 --> 00:04:23,532
SOCIAL, IT'S WHY THESE

164
00:04:23,533 --> 00:04:25,835
RALLIES -- I WAS IN HOUSTON, MY

165
00:04:25,836 --> 00:04:27,003
FATHER 22,000 PEOPLE IN THE

166
00:04:27,004 --> 00:04:28,738
AUDIENCE AND 50,000 PEOPLE

167
00:04:28,739 --> 00:04:29,405
OUTSIDE.

168
00:04:29,406 --> 00:04:30,206
IT'S WHY IT'S BEEN SUCH A

169
00:04:30,207 --> 00:04:31,340
POWERFUL TOOL FOR HIM, BECAUSE

170
00:04:31,341 --> 00:04:32,975
HE CAN TALK TO THE AMERICAN

171
00:04:32,976 --> 00:04:34,210
PEOPLE AND CUT THROUGH THE

172
00:04:34,211 --> 00:04:34,577
NONSENSE.

173
00:04:34,578 --> 00:04:35,911
ABOUT THE MEDIA.

174
00:04:35,912 --> 00:04:39,015
YOU KNOW THIS BETTER THAN ANY

175
00:04:39,016 --> 00:04:40,449
HUMAN BEING IN THE WORLD,

176
00:04:40,450 --> 00:04:42,018
CONTROLLED BY A VERY SMALL GROUP

177
00:04:42,019 --> 00:04:42,418
OF ELITISTS.

178
00:04:42,419 --> 00:04:43,219
THEY DON'T LIKE HIM, THEY DON'T

179
00:04:43,220 --> 00:04:44,987
LIKE HIS MESSAGE.

180
00:04:44,988 --> 00:04:47,556
THEY GOT IT WRONG.

181
00:04:47,557 --> 00:04:49,859
THEY DIDN'T THINK HE COULD WIN.

182
00:04:49,860 --> 00:04:51,360
IN TERMS OF "THE NEW YORK TIMES"

183
00:04:51,361 --> 00:04:52,928
THEY GIVE HIM A 1.9% CHANCE OF

184
00:04:52,929 --> 00:04:54,096
WINNING THAT ELECTION DAY AND

185
00:04:54,097 --> 00:04:56,699
NOW THEY'RE DOUBLING DOWN AND

186
00:04:56,700 --> 00:04:57,500
THEY'RE DOUBLING DOWN AGAIN AND

187
00:04:57,501 --> 00:04:58,834
IF THAT HYPOCRISY.

188
00:04:58,835 --> 00:05:00,169
THEY DON'T WANT MY FATHER TO BE

189
00:05:00,170 --> 00:05:00,836
RIGHT.

190
00:05:00,837 --> 00:05:02,304
THEY WANT TO DO ANYTHING THEY

191
00:05:02,305 --> 00:05:04,140
CAN TO USE ANYTHING AGAINST MY

192
00:05:04,141 --> 00:05:06,609
FATHER AND I SAY THIS ALL THE

193
00:05:06,610 --> 00:05:07,376
TIME, THEY ARE ABSOLUTELY GOING

194
00:05:07,377 --> 00:05:09,412
TO GET IT WRONG AGAIN.

195
00:05:09,413 --> 00:05:11,681
>> Sean: WHAT YOUR TAKE ON THE

196
00:05:11,682 --> 00:05:13,049
MIDTERM?

197
00:05:13,050 --> 00:05:15,251
>> IT'S A HARDER READ IN THE

198
00:05:15,252 --> 00:05:18,654
HOUSE.

199
00:05:18,655 --> 00:05:19,422
I DO BELIEVE EVERYTHING IS IN

200
00:05:19,423 --> 00:05:21,424
PLAY AND IT'S ALL ABOUT TURNOUT.

201
00:05:21,425 --> 00:05:22,658
>> IF THE ARMY OF TRUMP GETS OUT

202
00:05:22,659 --> 00:05:23,659
THERE WE WILL WIN.

203
00:05:23,660 --> 00:05:25,828
IF PEOPLE ARE COMPLACENT AND

204
00:05:25,829 --> 00:05:27,063
THEY STAY AT HOME I DON'T THINK

205
00:05:27,064 --> 00:05:27,830
WE WILL.

206
00:05:27,831 --> 00:05:28,597
IF THE ARMY OF TRUMP HAS TO GET

207
00:05:28,598 --> 00:05:30,399
OUT AND I HEAR ALL THE TIME MY

208
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:32,435
GUY IS NOT THE BALLOT.

209
00:05:32,436 --> 00:05:33,569
I GO YOU CAN'T THINK THAT WAY,

210
00:05:33,570 --> 00:05:36,539
YOU HAVE TO GET OUT, YOU HAVE TO

211
00:05:36,540 --> 00:05:36,839
VOTE.

212
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:38,274
IF YOU ARE NOT VOTING REPUBLICAN

213
00:05:38,275 --> 00:05:38,941
YOU ARE EFFECTIVELY VOTING

214
00:05:38,942 --> 00:05:40,843
AGAINST MY FATHER AND YOU HAVE

215
00:05:40,844 --> 00:05:41,644
TO GET OUT.

216
00:05:41,645 --> 00:05:43,112
THE COUNTRY IS DOING SO WELL,

217
00:05:43,113 --> 00:05:47,249
OUR ECONOMY IS DOING WELL.

218
00:05:47,250 --> 00:05:48,617
>> Sean: WE KNOW WITH THE

219
00:05:48,618 --> 00:05:49,318
PELOSI AGENDA IS.

220
00:05:49,319 --> 00:05:51,721
THEY WANT TO KEEP OBAMACARE,

221
00:05:51,722 --> 00:05:53,089
THEY WANT THEIR CRUMBS BACK.

222
00:05:53,090 --> 00:05:56,659
THEY WANT OPEN BORDERS.

223
00:05:56,660 --> 00:05:57,626
>> THEY WANT TO DOUBLE YOUR

224
00:05:57,627 --> 00:05:58,828
TAXES AND THEY WANT TO FIGHT

225
00:05:58,829 --> 00:06:00,062
LAW ENFORCEMENT AND ABOLISH ICE

226
00:06:00,063 --> 00:06:01,864
AND THEY WANT TO DO SO MANY

227
00:06:01,865 --> 00:06:02,298
OTHER THINGS.

228
00:06:02,299 --> 00:06:03,099
THIS COUNTRY IS ON FIRE.

229
00:06:03,100 --> 00:06:05,634
IT'S DOING SO WELL AND WE HAVE

230
00:06:05,635 --> 00:06:07,536
TO KEEP REPUBLICANS IN POWER.

231
00:06:07,537 --> 00:06:08,237
>> Sean: IT'S A WEIRD POSITION

232
00:06:08,238 --> 00:06:10,940
TO BE IN THAT THEY ALMOST HAVE

233
00:06:10,941 --> 00:06:11,907
TO CHEER FOR AMERICA TO DO AS

234
00:06:11,908 --> 00:06:13,909
BAD AS WE DID IN THE OBAMA YEARS

235
00:06:13,910 --> 00:06:15,811
SO THEY CAN GET THEIR POWER BACK

236
00:06:15,812 --> 00:06:17,446
AND IT'S JUST THE OPPOSITE HAS

237
00:06:17,447 --> 00:06:18,247
HAPPENED.

238
00:06:18,248 --> 00:06:19,014
TWO YEARS OF AMAZING PROSPERITY.

239
00:06:19,015 --> 00:06:23,419
WHAT I'M ARGUING IS IF YOU VOTE

240
00:06:23,420 --> 00:06:24,587
FOR ANY DEMOCRAT IN ANY DISTRICT

241
00:06:24,588 --> 00:06:26,856
IN THE HOUSE, YOU ARE VOTING FOR

242
00:06:26,857 --> 00:06:27,189
PELOSI.

243
00:06:27,190 --> 00:06:28,958
YOU DON'T SHOW UP, THAT'S A HALF

244
00:06:28,959 --> 00:06:31,227
A VOTE FOR PELOSI AND IF YOU

245
00:06:31,228 --> 00:06:31,961
VOTE FOR ANY DEMOCRATIC SENATOR

246
00:06:31,962 --> 00:06:33,229
YOU MIGHT AS WELL VOTE FOR

247
00:06:33,230 --> 00:06:34,430
CHUCK SCHUMER BECAUSE THAT'S

248
00:06:34,431 --> 00:06:35,231
WHAT YOU'RE GETTING.

249
00:06:35,232 --> 00:06:36,632
>> THAT'S 100% RIGHT.

250
00:06:36,633 --> 00:06:38,467
THEY WOULD RATHER SEE AMERICA

251
00:06:38,468 --> 00:06:39,468
FAIL THAN MY FATHER SUCCEED.

252
00:06:39,469 --> 00:06:40,436
I'VE SAID THAT FOR YEARS.

253
00:06:40,437 --> 00:06:42,238
THEY WOULD RATHER SEE AMERICA

254
00:06:42,239 --> 00:06:43,806
FAIL THAN MY FATHER SUCCEED.

255
00:06:43,807 --> 00:06:44,473
REPUBLICANS HAVE TO GET OUT

256
00:06:44,474 --> 00:00:00,000
THERE, YOU HAVE TO VOTE AND YOU
