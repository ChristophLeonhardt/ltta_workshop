1
00:00:00,119 --> 00:00:04,482
“We are right on the eve of
the legalization of trees

2
00:00:04,482 --> 00:00:05,478
in Canada.

3
00:00:05,478 --> 00:00:08,555
At 12 o’clock midnight, you
can smoke what you want,

4
00:00:08,555 --> 00:00:10,458
take hits from the bong.

5
00:00:10,458 --> 00:00:14,773
Canadians, make some noise!”

6
00:00:24,510 --> 00:00:26,870
It’s a new era for Canadians —

7
00:00:26,870 --> 00:00:30,570
the full legalization of
marijuana across the country.

8
00:00:30,570 --> 00:00:32,450
It’s been legal to
consume cannabis here

9
00:00:32,450 --> 00:00:35,060
for medical reasons
since 2001.

10
00:00:35,060 --> 00:00:38,600
But now, anyone in Canada over
the legal age can get high.

11
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:41,120
And that means Canada’s
booming weed business

12
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:43,670
is about to get a
whole lot bigger.

13
00:00:43,670 --> 00:00:45,550
We went to see some
of the producers who

14
00:00:45,550 --> 00:00:48,475
are set to take advantage
of this opportunity.

15
00:00:48,475 --> 00:00:51,800
“It’s got kind of a
citrusy and pine smell

16
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:52,880
both at the same time.

17
00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:54,048
This is one of the Kushes.

18
00:00:54,048 --> 00:00:57,550
It’s got more of a
turpentine, maybe

19
00:00:57,550 --> 00:00:58,870
a little more earthy smell.

20
00:00:58,870 --> 00:01:01,070
This is a very
popular strain for us.

21
00:01:01,070 --> 00:01:03,695
We call this
deep purple, very fruity.”

22
00:01:03,695 --> 00:01:06,505
Warren Bravo was a
co-founder of Green Relief,

23
00:01:06,505 --> 00:01:08,030
a medical marijuana
company that

24
00:01:08,030 --> 00:01:11,300
is now well-placed to enter
the recreational space.

25
00:01:11,300 --> 00:01:13,730
He’s aiming to increase
production 20-fold

26
00:01:13,730 --> 00:01:16,080
over the next year and a half.

27
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:17,410
And that’s nothing
compared to

28
00:01:17,410 --> 00:01:19,700
Canada’s top
marijuana producer:

29
00:01:19,700 --> 00:01:22,550
Tweed Inc., a brand
of big-time operation,

30
00:01:22,550 --> 00:01:24,970
Canopy Growth.

31
00:01:24,970 --> 00:01:28,145
One vault here can
hold about $150 million

32
00:01:28,145 --> 00:01:29,315
worth of cannabis.

33
00:01:29,315 --> 00:01:32,097
“Yeah, so in this
facility, on this side

34
00:01:32,097 --> 00:01:33,430
that we’re
touring here, we have

35
00:01:33,430 --> 00:01:37,390
24 flowering rooms and
then about another 24

36
00:01:37,390 --> 00:01:38,769
on the other side as well.

37
00:01:38,769 --> 00:01:40,060
This is, at the
end of the day,

38
00:01:40,060 --> 00:01:42,532
what all of the fuss and
excitement is about, I guess.

39
00:01:42,532 --> 00:01:43,990
When we reached
out the first time,

40
00:01:43,990 --> 00:01:45,650
I think, you know, 
the New York Stock Exchange

41
00:01:45,650 --> 00:01:47,300
probably, you know,
rightly said, ‘No way.’

42
00:01:47,300 --> 00:01:49,216
You know, we’re not
having a cannabis company.

43
00:01:49,216 --> 00:01:51,250
And then that
education process started.

44
00:01:51,250 --> 00:01:53,350
And if you try to break
down these barriers,

45
00:01:53,350 --> 00:01:55,750
and demonstrate we’re
a normal company

46
00:01:55,750 --> 00:01:58,294
creating a normal product
like anyone else.”

47
00:01:58,294 --> 00:01:59,710
And it’s a product
that’s becoming

48
00:01:59,710 --> 00:02:03,460
a formal field of study, fast.

49
00:02:03,460 --> 00:02:06,700
“We’re running the only
postgraduate certificate

50
00:02:06,700 --> 00:02:09,100
program in cannabis
in Canada.”

51
00:02:12,150 --> 00:02:13,970
Bill MacDonald
teaches a class of 24

52
00:02:13,970 --> 00:02:16,960
highly dedicated students,
that includes

53
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:18,297
a former police officer.

54
00:02:18,297 --> 00:02:19,800
“It did take
some reconciliation

55
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:21,440
because I was, obviously,
on the other side.

56
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:23,480
But it’s in society.

57
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:24,360
It’s out there, now.

58
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:27,590
So, if we’re going to have it
and it’s going to be here,

59
00:02:27,590 --> 00:02:29,380
let’s control it properly.”

60
00:02:29,380 --> 00:02:31,080
That’s the thing — 
for people who

61
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:34,400
were hoping for a free-for-all
and one-love openness,

62
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:35,990
it’s a disappointment.

63
00:02:35,990 --> 00:02:37,880
“Cannabis is going
to be legalized

64
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:39,950
in certain contexts,
but it’s also going

65
00:02:39,950 --> 00:02:41,750
to be very heavily regulated.

66
00:02:41,750 --> 00:02:44,450
And my concern is that
people don’t recognize

67
00:02:44,450 --> 00:02:48,260
the extent to which it will
still, in certain contexts,

68
00:02:48,260 --> 00:02:49,130
be illegal.

69
00:02:49,130 --> 00:02:51,320
And that might bring them
in conflict with the law.”

70
00:02:51,935 --> 00:02:54,590
“African-Canadian people,
our community is very afraid

71
00:02:54,590 --> 00:02:58,040
to now come out and actually
be a part of this market,

72
00:02:58,040 --> 00:02:59,916
because we’ve been
criminalized for so long.”

73
00:02:59,916 --> 00:03:01,998
Noni Haynes is part
of a group leading

74
00:03:01,998 --> 00:03:03,550
a discussion on
new cannabis laws

75
00:03:03,550 --> 00:03:05,335
at a local
community center.

76
00:03:05,335 --> 00:03:07,370
“And who is making
money from the weed?

77
00:03:07,370 --> 00:03:09,010
Not the average person.”

78
00:03:09,010 --> 00:03:09,890
“I don’t know if
you don’t know,

79
00:03:09,890 --> 00:03:11,370
we live in a
capitalist society.

80
00:03:11,370 --> 00:03:13,757
And, you know, within
capitalism, anything goes.”

81
00:03:13,757 --> 00:03:14,840
“That’s a very good point.

82
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:16,131
I mean, now is
the opportunity.

83
00:03:16,131 --> 00:03:19,130
If you capitalize on that,
you have your business,

84
00:03:19,130 --> 00:03:21,680
or you grow your business,
you expand your clientele.

85
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:25,235
And you treat it like
an actual corporation.”

86
00:03:25,235 --> 00:03:27,120
A few days
before legalization,

87
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:30,365
we came to a kind of marijuana
farmer’s market in Toronto,

88
00:03:30,365 --> 00:03:32,990
at Planet Paradise.

89
00:03:32,990 --> 00:03:35,000
In the past
few years, this place

90
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,040
has been tolerated by police.

91
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:38,870
But now, fines have
been ramped up,

92
00:03:38,870 --> 00:03:41,360
and the organizers
here are shutting shop,

93
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:43,470
worried about a crackdown.

94
00:03:43,470 --> 00:03:45,802
“We’re planning on not really
having anything like this

95
00:03:45,802 --> 00:03:47,510
till we see where the
law is going to go.

96
00:03:47,510 --> 00:03:49,640
Because we don’t want to have
a bunch of issues ourselves,

97
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:50,139
right?

98
00:03:50,139 --> 00:03:52,340
So we figured we’d
have one last hurrah,

99
00:03:52,340 --> 00:03:55,677
just to get people
together and smoke.”

100
00:04:09,324 --> 00:04:12,480
We travelled to an
indigenous Mohawk territory,

101
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:15,960
another place where marijuana
is openly sold illegally.

102
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:19,140
There are over 40 unlicensed
dispensaries here.

103
00:04:19,140 --> 00:04:23,510
Jamie Kunkel owns one
of them, Smoke Signals.

104
00:04:23,510 --> 00:04:24,935
He’s not worried.

105
00:04:24,935 --> 00:04:27,410
“The amount of customers that
we go through, I believe,

106
00:04:27,410 --> 00:04:31,340
is going to increase because of
the system that they’ve set up.

107
00:04:31,340 --> 00:04:34,370
They’re not providing
the Canadian constituency

108
00:04:34,370 --> 00:04:37,520
with a reasonable place
to purchase this plant.

109
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:41,135
I personally think they’ve set
themselves up for failure.”

110
00:04:41,135 --> 00:04:42,760
Jamie is pointing to
the fact that there

111
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:45,020
are no legal
brick-and-mortar dispensaries

112
00:04:45,020 --> 00:04:47,180
in the province of Ontario.

113
00:04:47,180 --> 00:04:50,150
Lawful purchases
must be made online,

114
00:04:50,150 --> 00:04:52,790
and those do not include
any of the cannabis-infused

115
00:04:52,790 --> 00:04:54,470
products sold here.

116
00:04:54,470 --> 00:04:56,360
“Milk chocolate
espresso beans,

117
00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:57,710
milk chocolate almonds.

118
00:04:57,710 --> 00:04:59,120
Jeez, you know, I was
really looking forward

119
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:01,038
and hoping it was
going to be the salsa.”

120
00:05:06,665 --> 00:05:08,480
Canada is only
the second country

121
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:11,980
in the world to legalize
cannabis after Uruguay.

122
00:05:11,980 --> 00:05:13,550
But it’s the first
major economy

123
00:05:13,550 --> 00:05:15,785
to run this experiment.

124
00:05:15,785 --> 00:05:17,950
And whatever it
leads to,

125
00:05:17,950 --> 00:00:00,000
Canada will be
leading the way.
