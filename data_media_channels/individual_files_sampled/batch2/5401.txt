well the fate of the Cavanaugh nomination is still unclear the accusations against him could prove to have dramatic political consequences come November especially for a party led by Donald Trump The Washington Post reports quote strategists in both parties say Trump's agenda and style and the fact that the GOP leadership stands mostly in lockstep with him are undoing years of often painstaking work by party leaders to court more female and minority voters Trump risk solidifying the Republican Party as the party of men though he is not on the ballot this fall he's framing the midterm elections as a referendum on his presidency and that has leaders and operatives in the party fearing what GOP strategist Alex Castellanos term a pink wave of women powering a democratic takeover of the House and perhaps the Senate to deliver a rebuke to trump and if you wonder as we have on this program how the president's female advisors stand by while he attacks an anchors plastic surgery or makes derogatory remarks about female politicians or stands by his endorsement of an accused child molester like Roy Moore consider this from the Post report quote inside Trump's political orbit there long has been what one former White House official called a blindness to gender issues as a political liability in part because the president resents the accusations that have been brought against him personally and because he and his allies see the broader issue as a liberal talking point I'm sorry Jenner it is not a liberal talking point to think that women deserve better than a president who stands by his endorsement of a child accused child molester like Roy Moore every president reminds you of someone Ronald Reagan was dad this guy reminds you of your abusive ex-husband he's a bully he lies he makes your life miserable and you feel the oppression from him you feel the contempt for him he makes you feel like a non-person that's what American women see when they look at this man and when he stands by as you said Roe more and when he goes after multiple now women complainants who have come forward to lodge complaints against judge Kathryn awe and pursues either a mistaken identity thing or a not even slutty themed as they did with needed hell women in America recoil and I do think it's men as well but I think you're gonna see women voting like you have never seen before you've all already seen them running for office like never before we saw a little bit of it in my home state in Virginia in 2017 suburban women turned out in droves Ron Klain let me get you in the politics but let me also get you on the one woman that seems to break the mold and that's stormy Danielle Sue's out with a new book I read the Washington Post review of her book and she seems to be out trumping Trump by being more crude than him talking about his body parts this is sort of a body part day so I'll just put that out there and getting under his skin by by going at him where it hurts his you know ego his his frail male prowess if you will and and and it seems like if there's a political lesson here it's sort of fighting fire with fire is that something that Democrats have to take into consideration I don't know about that Nicola I think no no no nor am I going to talk about where it hurts but but but but i but look I do think that the bigger issue here is how the Republican Party is kind of remaking itself in Donald Trump's images not just the Trump carries this pall over his party as a party of toxic masculinity but his candidates Republican candidates kind of a mimic Trump and so you have the Republican nominee for Senate in North Dakota this week running against an incumbent woman Heidi Heitkamp and a state Republicans might be able to pick up say about this a Cavanaugh incident that you know it was just an attempt that never went anywhere as if you know what happened what was wasn't a serious attack at all and so you know I think Trump it's not just a Trump himself as a problem for Republicans Republicans are acting very Trumpy and that is going to get them in trouble as you said record number of women running for office a hundred and eighty Democratic women are running for the house that's 50% more than any year in American history the previous record is a hundred and twenty so there's a pink wave coming and it's going to have a big impact this fall God willing and we're do a pink wait let me put something that just came in to us Brett Kavanaugh and his wife Ashley sat down with Fox News's Martha McCallum for an interview little air later tonight we just got a clip let's watch did you guys ever look at your show they're gonna say I'm out this is enough this just isn't worth it I'm not gonna let false accusations tribe us out of this process and we're looking for a fair process where I could be heard and defend the my integrity my lifelong record my lifelong record of promoting dignity and equality for women starting with the women who knew me when I was 14 years old I'm not going anywhere yeah well I think it's interesting that has to be viewed in the context of the last 48 hours and Republicans really ramping up this line that Democrats and you know they are choreographing to use Mitch McConnell's words a smear campaign against Brett Kavanaugh that they are politicizing this nomination process and what you see is a White House and a political shop and aren't see everybody sort of marching in lockstep trying to defend him you see them putting Brett Kavanaugh on television tonight fighting this in the PR space ahead of Thursday's hearing ahead of when dr. Ford is supposed to go out there and testify first she now will testify after this interview tonight she's reportedly turned down a lot of press interviews and wants to keep this just in the space of the Senate hearing on Thursday but they are out there therefore they are fighting a PR battle on the Republican side they are digging in on this because again I don't think they see any other great options for them at this point and and you know this is it's just it's fascinating a lot of people we will be watching this tonight but he is telling his story and getting out in front of the accuser for sure and he's doing it on Fox News speaking to for human being speaking to Susan Collins lisa murkowski jeff corker i'm sorry senator corker and Senator flake do you think that that is helpful it might be helpful with those few senators I think look obviously it's the playbook you've seen from a number of male politicians when they're accused of sexual impropriety they do an interview with their wife Bill Clinton did that way back in 1992 what the decision to do that interview now tells me is they're worried he doesn't make it Thursday because you could come out before the hearing and answer these accusations then I think they're worried that if Lisa Murkowski and Susan Collins go to Mitch McConnell before then and say our votes aren't there don't put the country through this hearing don't put the Republican majority to this hearing where you have eleven you know male Republican senators glowering at you know dr. Blasi Ford from from the Dyess it's gonna be harmful to us and so they've decided they can't wait for Thursday for him to tell a story and let's be honest they need to do with under much friendlier questioning where he's not going to be a specifics about did he drink to until he blacked out does he remember these things were there other women he's going to get a much more friendlier audience to say those yeah there was some reporting over the weekend that there were some questions that crossed that line for him in the moot sessions at the White House that he deemed too personal that was the first sense I got that there are people in the White House who would rather him not go through with this because you do not know what leaked those sorts of details if you have complete confidence in your nominee so it was either an attempt to wake him up and shape up in these sessions or it was an indication that maybe we should get him out of the way but listen this is not going to end on Thursday you now have another accuser Deborah Ramirez with multiple confirming confirming witnesses how does Susan Collins and Jeff Flake who said I'm not going to vote until I hear from this woman how do they go forward without hearing from her this is not going to end on Thursday let me give you the last word Ron Klain can you speak to how you see this interview in the context of what we've been discussing all hour about this nomination now consumed in controversy yeah I agree with Matt it's a sign the White House is worried the nominations in trouble I think it's also a sign of the politicization of the process that they're putting about on Fox as opposed to a new more neutral outlet trying to obviously communicate to their base in their supporters but you know the last time the Republicans jammed through a nominee on these facts was 1991 they got their man in the end but they lost the elections badly in 1992 and you know justice should be done we were the other on judge Kavanagh but then the women of America can have the final say come election day this November and do you think that there's any space in this debate to slow this down do you think it would behoove the Republicans to say it's in as you the beginning of your appearance here it's in his interest to to slow this down if you're really confident in the facts you want to get them all out you know Cole I think they made a decision on that last week right after the doctor Ford went public that they were going to try to jam it and so I think they're on a path to jam it that's where they're headed I don't think they're gonna back off that hey there I'm Chris Hayes from MSNBC thanks for watching MSNBC on YouTube if you want to keep up to date with the videos we're putting out you can click Subscribe just below me or click over on this list to see lots of other great videos
