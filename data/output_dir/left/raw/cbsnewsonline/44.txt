1
00:00:02,902 --> 00:00:03,970
THE FRONT ROW AND PRESIDENT 

2
00:00:03,970 --> 00:00:04,570
DONALD TRUMP APPROACHING THE 

3
00:00:04,570 --> 00:00:05,071
PODIUM NOW. 

4
00:00:05,071 --> 00:00:05,505
LET'S LISTEN. 

5
00:00:05,505 --> 00:00:07,140
>> THREE DAYS AT THE UNITED 

6
00:00:07,140 --> 00:00:08,173
NATIONS IN NEW YORK. 

7
00:00:08,173 --> 00:00:09,676
THIS IS QUITE A GATHERING OF 

8
00:00:09,676 --> 00:00:10,310
PEOPLE. 

9
00:00:10,310 --> 00:00:15,915
LOT OF MEDIA. 

10
00:00:15,915 --> 00:00:17,150
WE'VE COVERED A GREAT DEAL OF 

11
00:00:17,150 --> 00:00:29,963
TERRITORY, AND JUST LEFT, AS 

12
00:00:29,963 --> 00:00:30,796
YOU KNOW, PRIME MINISTER SHINZO 

13
00:00:30,796 --> 00:00:31,497
ABE OF JAPAN. 

14
00:00:31,497 --> 00:00:32,398
WE ARE STARTING TRADE TALKS 

15
00:00:32,398 --> 00:00:32,799
WITH JAPAN. 

16
00:00:32,799 --> 00:00:33,766
THEY WERE NOT WILLING FOR YEARS 

17
00:00:33,766 --> 00:00:34,767
TO TALK TRADE AND NOW THEY'RE 

18
00:00:34,767 --> 00:00:36,903
WILLING TO TALK TRADE AND I'M 

19
00:00:36,903 --> 00:00:40,039
SURE WE WILL MAKE A VERY GOOD 

20
00:00:40,039 --> 00:00:40,340
DEAL. 

21
00:00:40,340 --> 00:00:42,242
JUST CONCLUDED, AS YOU KNOW, 

22
00:00:42,242 --> 00:00:44,377
TWO DAYS AGO, SIGNED A DEAL 

23
00:00:44,377 --> 00:00:45,879
WITH SOUTH KOREA, A TREMENDOUS 

24
00:00:45,879 --> 00:00:47,046
DEAL WAS SOUTH KOREA THAT MEANS 

25
00:00:47,046 --> 00:00:49,716
A LOT OF BUSINESS FOR OUR 

26
00:00:49,716 --> 00:00:49,983
FARMERS. 

27
00:00:49,983 --> 00:00:51,651
WE ARE OPENING UP FOR FARMERS 

28
00:00:51,651 --> 00:00:52,786
AND A LOT OF DIFFERENT GROUPS 

29
00:00:52,786 --> 00:00:54,921
AND WE ARE GOING TO BE ABLE TO 

30
00:00:54,921 --> 00:00:57,090
SO MUCH MORE THAN DOUBLE THE 

31
00:00:57,090 --> 00:00:58,391
NUMBER OF AUTOMOBILES THAT WE 

32
00:00:58,391 --> 00:00:59,192
WERE ALLOWED UNDER THE DEAL 

33
00:00:59,192 --> 00:01:00,693
THAT WAS TOTALLY DEFECTIVE THAT 

34
00:01:00,693 --> 00:01:04,931
WAS THERE BEFORE. 

35
00:01:04,931 --> 00:01:07,267
WE ARE HAPPY WITH THAT AND THAT 

36
00:01:07,267 --> 00:01:08,935
DEAL WAS ACTUALLY CONCLUDED AND 

37
00:01:08,935 --> 00:01:11,871
WE ARE WELL ALONG THE WAY WITH 

38
00:01:11,871 --> 00:01:12,104
MEXICO. 

39
00:01:12,104 --> 00:01:13,906
WITH CANADA, WE WILL SEE WHAT 

40
00:01:13,906 --> 00:01:14,607
HAPPENS. 

41
00:01:14,607 --> 00:01:16,442
THEY CHARGED 300% ON DAIRY 

42
00:01:16,442 --> 00:01:18,077
PRODUCTS AND WE CAN'T HAVE 

43
00:01:18,077 --> 00:01:18,277
THAT. 

44
00:01:18,277 --> 00:01:19,612
WE CAN'T HAVE THAT. 

45
00:01:19,612 --> 00:01:22,382
WITH CHINA, AS YOU KNOW, WE PUT 

46
00:01:22,382 --> 00:01:24,450
OUT AN ANNOUNCEMENT TODAY AND 

47
00:01:24,450 --> 00:01:26,286
THEY WOULD LIKE TO SEE ME LOSE 

48
00:01:26,286 --> 00:01:27,587
AN ELECTION BECAUSE THEY'VE 

49
00:01:27,587 --> 00:01:30,290
NEVER BEEN CHALLENGED LIKE 

50
00:01:30,290 --> 00:01:30,690
THIS. 

51
00:01:30,690 --> 00:01:32,158
BUT, I WANT TO OPEN UP CHINA TO 

52
00:01:32,158 --> 00:01:33,960
OUR FARMERS AND OUR 

53
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:35,795
INDUSTRIALISTS AND OUR 

54
00:01:35,795 --> 00:01:36,095
COMPANIES. 

55
00:01:36,095 --> 00:01:37,931
CHINA IS NOT OPEN BUT WE ARE 

56
00:01:37,931 --> 00:01:39,565
OPEN TO THEM. 

57
00:01:39,565 --> 00:01:42,902
THEY CHARGE US 25, 35, 55% FOR 

58
00:01:42,902 --> 00:01:44,237
THINGS AND WE CHARGE THEM 

59
00:01:44,237 --> 00:01:45,738
NOTHING IN TERMS OF COMING INTO 

60
00:01:45,738 --> 00:01:46,071
THE COUNTRY. 

61
00:01:46,071 --> 00:01:51,077
CARS THAT ARE 25% AND WE ARE 2% 

62
00:01:51,077 --> 00:01:52,312
IN 2.5% AND DON'T EVEN COLLECT 

63
00:01:52,312 --> 00:01:58,251
IT, BUT WE COLLECT IT NOW. 

64
00:01:58,251 --> 00:02:00,053
WE ARE DOING VERY WELL IN OUR 

65
00:02:00,053 --> 00:02:01,620
SITUATION WITH CHINA ON TRADE. 

66
00:02:01,620 --> 00:02:02,588
I HAVE A GREAT RELATIONSHIP 

67
00:02:02,588 --> 00:02:03,890
WITH THE PRESIDENT OF CHINA, 

68
00:02:03,890 --> 00:02:04,257
PRESIDENT  Xi. 

69
00:02:04,257 --> 00:02:09,027
BUT, IT'S GOT TO BE A TWO WAY 

70
00:02:09,027 --> 00:02:14,367
STREET. 

71
00:02:14,367 --> 00:02:14,934
TRILLIONS AND TRILLIONS WAS 

72
00:02:14,934 --> 00:02:16,703
TAKEN OUT OF THE U.S. FOR THE 

73
00:02:16,703 --> 00:02:27,881
BENEFIT OF CHINA. 

74
00:02:27,881 --> 00:02:30,683
25% INTEREST AND A LOT OF MONEY 

75
00:02:30,683 --> 00:02:31,884
IS COMING INTO OUR COFFERS AND 

76
00:02:31,884 --> 00:02:32,919
IT HAD NO IMPACT ON OUR -- 

77
00:02:32,919 --> 00:02:35,154
ABSOLUTELY -- NO IMPACT ON OUR 

78
00:02:35,154 --> 00:02:37,624
ECONOMY. 

79
00:02:37,624 --> 00:02:41,027
STEEL IS THE HOTTEST INDUSTRY 

80
00:02:41,027 --> 00:02:48,668
THERE IS. 

81
00:02:48,668 --> 00:02:49,802
THEY WANT TO PUT THE STEEL 

82
00:02:49,802 --> 00:02:50,803
COMPANIES OUT OF BUSINESS AND 

83
00:02:50,803 --> 00:02:55,174
AFTER THAT, THEY WILL COME IN 

84
00:02:55,174 --> 00:02:56,576
WITH FIVE TIMES MORE THAN YOU 

85
00:02:56,576 --> 00:02:56,976
THOUGHT POSSIBLE. 

86
00:02:56,976 --> 00:02:57,877
WE NEED STEEL AND ALUMINUM AND 

87
00:02:57,877 --> 00:02:59,112
THOSE INDUSTRIES ARE DOING WELL 

88
00:02:59,112 --> 00:03:01,581
BUT STEEL IS INCREDIBLE. 

89
00:03:01,581 --> 00:03:02,615
U.S. STEEL IS OPENING UP A 

90
00:03:02,615 --> 00:03:11,124
MINIMUM OF EIGHT PLANTS, THESE 

91
00:03:11,124 --> 00:03:14,794
ARE BIG PLANS, $750,000,000.1 

92
00:03:14,794 --> 00:03:16,062
BILLION PLANTS IN SOME CASES. 

93
00:03:16,062 --> 00:03:18,498
WHAT'S HAPPENING WITH THE STEEL 

94
00:03:18,498 --> 00:03:20,833
INDUSTRY, IS VERY EXCITING TO ME

95
00:03:20,833 --> 00:03:21,968
AND IT'S BEING REBUILT 

96
00:03:21,968 --> 00:03:22,268
OVERNIGHT. 

97
00:03:22,268 --> 00:03:23,136
IF YOU LOOK AT THE MINORS WITH 

98
00:03:23,136 --> 00:03:27,907
COAL AND ENERGY AND JAPAN JUST 

99
00:03:27,907 --> 00:03:28,941
GAVE NUMBERS THAT ARE 

100
00:03:28,941 --> 00:03:29,241
INCREDIBLE. 

101
00:03:29,241 --> 00:03:30,476
THEY ARE DOUBLING THE AMOUNT 

102
00:03:30,476 --> 00:03:32,144
THAT THEY WILL BE BUYING FOR 

103
00:03:32,144 --> 00:03:36,149
JAPAN AND THEY ARE TAKING THE 

104
00:03:36,149 --> 00:03:38,918
LNG AND DOUBLINGIT UP AND I 

105
00:03:38,918 --> 00:03:40,452
SAID, YOU HAVE TO DO ME A 

106
00:03:40,452 --> 00:03:40,686
FAVOR. 

107
00:03:40,686 --> 00:03:43,323
WE DON'T WANT THESE BIG 

108
00:03:43,323 --> 00:03:43,590
DEFICITS. 

109
00:03:43,590 --> 00:03:44,657
YOU HAVE TO BUY MORE AND THEY 

110
00:03:44,657 --> 00:03:45,691
ARE BUYING MASSIVE AMOUNTS OF 

111
00:03:45,691 --> 00:03:46,659
EQUIPMENT AND MILITARY 

112
00:03:46,659 --> 00:03:51,631
EQUIPMENT AND OTHER COUNTRIES 

113
00:03:51,631 --> 00:03:53,032
ARE DOING THE SAME THING. 

114
00:03:53,032 --> 00:03:56,769
WE HAVE TRADE IMBALANCES WITH 

115
00:03:56,769 --> 00:03:57,303
ALMOST EVERYBODY. 

116
00:03:57,303 --> 00:03:59,272
IT'S A RARE EXCEPTION THAT WE 

117
00:03:59,272 --> 00:04:00,573
DON'T. 

118
00:04:00,573 --> 00:04:02,608
SO, WE ARE DOING GREAT AS A 

119
00:04:02,608 --> 00:04:03,308
COUNTRY AND UNFORTUNATELY, THEY 

120
00:04:03,308 --> 00:04:04,077
RAISED INTEREST RATES BECAUSE 

121
00:04:04,077 --> 00:04:05,712
THEY ARE DOING SO WELL AND I'M 

122
00:04:05,712 --> 00:04:08,548
NOT HAPPY BECAUSE I KNOW IT 

123
00:04:08,548 --> 00:04:10,349
WILL BE A QUESTION. 

124
00:04:10,349 --> 00:04:11,550
I'M NOT HAPPY ABOUT THAT. 

125
00:04:11,550 --> 00:04:12,919
I'D RATHER PAY DOWN DEBT OR DO 

126
00:04:12,919 --> 00:04:18,690
OTHER THINGS, CREATE MORE JOBS. 

127
00:04:18,690 --> 00:04:20,660
SO, I'M WORRIED ABOUT THE FACT 

128
00:04:20,660 --> 00:04:23,096
THAT THEY SEEM TO LIKE RAISING 

129
00:04:23,096 --> 00:04:23,463
INTEREST RATES. 

130
00:04:23,463 --> 00:04:26,265
WE CAN DO OTHER THINGS WITH THE 

131
00:04:26,265 --> 00:04:26,498
MONEY. 

132
00:04:26,498 --> 00:04:27,934
THEY RAISED THEM AND THEY'RE 

133
00:04:27,934 --> 00:04:29,102
RAISING THEM BECAUSE WE ARE 

134
00:04:29,102 --> 00:04:30,169
DOING SO WELL. 

135
00:04:30,169 --> 00:04:32,105
WE ARE DOING MUCH BETTER THAN I 

136
00:04:32,105 --> 00:04:33,473
HAD PROJECTED, IN TERMS OF WHEN 

137
00:04:33,473 --> 00:04:33,906
I WAS CAMPAIGNING. 

138
00:04:33,906 --> 00:04:35,275
I SAID WE WERE GOING TO DO THIS 

139
00:04:35,275 --> 00:04:36,909
AND WE ARE DOING MUCH BETTER 

140
00:04:36,909 --> 00:04:41,046
THAN ANYBODY EVER THOUGHT 

141
00:04:41,046 --> 00:04:42,882
POSSIBLE. 

142
00:04:42,882 --> 00:04:46,119
I WILL SAY, IF OTHERS GOT IN, 

143
00:04:46,119 --> 00:04:47,653
IT WOULD HAVE BEEN JUST THE 

144
00:04:47,653 --> 00:04:48,755
OPPOSITE BECAUSE THEY WERE 

145
00:04:48,755 --> 00:04:49,856
GOING TO PUT ON RESTRICTIONS 

146
00:04:49,856 --> 00:04:50,790
AND REGULATIONS AND THEY WOULD 

147
00:04:50,790 --> 00:04:52,625
HAVE CHOKED THE ECONOMY AS IT 

148
00:04:52,625 --> 00:04:53,693
WAS ALREADY CHOKING BUT IT 

149
00:04:53,693 --> 00:04:54,827
WOULD HAVE BEEN WORSE AND THEY 

150
00:04:54,827 --> 00:04:55,861
WILL RAISE YOUR TAXES. 

151
00:04:55,861 --> 00:04:57,764
THAT'S WHAT THEY WOULD DO NOW 

152
00:04:57,764 --> 00:04:59,732
IF THEY EVER GOT CONTROL. I 

153
00:04:59,732 --> 00:05:01,734
DON'T THINK THEY WILL HAVE 

154
00:05:01,734 --> 00:05:02,267
CONTROL FOR A LONG TIME. 

155
00:05:02,267 --> 00:05:03,803
WITH THAT BEING SAID, WE WILL 

156
00:05:03,803 --> 00:05:08,908
TAKE SOME QUESTIONS. 

157
00:05:08,908 --> 00:05:13,346
>> MR. PRESIDENT, THANK YOU 

158
00:05:13,346 --> 00:05:14,814
VERY MUCH. 

159
00:05:14,814 --> 00:05:16,783
OF COURSE, WE ARE LOOKING 

160
00:05:16,783 --> 00:05:17,750
FORWARD TO TOMORROW, FOR THE 

161
00:05:17,750 --> 00:05:18,985
HEARINGS WITH JUDGE KAVANAUGH 

162
00:05:18,985 --> 00:05:19,986
FOR THE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE. 

163
00:05:19,986 --> 00:05:20,219
>> YES. 

164
00:05:20,219 --> 00:05:23,456
>> IN 1991 WHEN JOE BIDEN 

165
00:05:23,456 --> 00:05:26,726
PASSED THE LAW TO THE BUSH 41 

166
00:05:26,726 --> 00:05:27,527
WHITE HOUSE, THE ALLEGATIONS 

167
00:05:27,527 --> 00:05:28,995
THAT ANITA HILL HAD RAISED 

168
00:05:28,995 --> 00:05:30,630
AGAINST CLARENCE THOMAS, THE 

169
00:05:30,630 --> 00:05:32,965
BUSH WHITE HOUSE ASKED THE FBI 

170
00:05:32,965 --> 00:05:36,436
TO LOOK INTO IT AS PART OF JUDGE

171
00:05:36,436 --> 00:05:38,004
THOMAS' BACKGROUND 

172
00:05:38,004 --> 00:05:38,371
INVESTIGATION. 

173
00:05:38,371 --> 00:05:39,572
NOT A CRIMINAL INVESTIGATION. 

174
00:05:39,572 --> 00:05:40,139
WHEN THESE ALLEGATIONS WERE 

175
00:05:40,139 --> 00:05:40,806
RAISED, WHY DIDN'T THIS WHITE 

176
00:05:40,806 --> 00:05:45,411
HOUSE DO THE SAME THING. WITH 

177
00:05:45,411 --> 00:05:46,479
ALL OF THE ALLEGATIONS COMING 

178
00:05:46,479 --> 00:05:47,413
OUT NOW ABOUT JUDGE KAVANAUGH, 

179
00:05:47,413 --> 00:05:48,213
WAS THERE AN OPPORTUNITY MISSED 

180
00:05:48,213 --> 00:05:49,348
TO HAVE INVESTIGATORS LOOK INTO 

181
00:05:49,348 --> 00:05:55,354
THIS AND GET SOME SORT OF 

182
00:05:55,354 --> 00:05:56,389
CLARITY ONE WAY OR THE OTHER? 

183
00:05:56,389 --> 00:05:57,356
>> THE FBI TOLD US THEY'VE 

184
00:05:57,356 --> 00:06:01,594
INVESTIGATED JUDGE KAVANAUGH 

185
00:06:01,594 --> 00:06:03,262
SIX TIMES, FIVE TIMES, MANY 

186
00:06:03,262 --> 00:06:05,698
TIMES OVER THE YEARS. 

187
00:06:05,698 --> 00:06:07,633
THEY KNOW HIM VERY WELL. 

188
00:06:07,633 --> 00:06:08,701
HERE, THERE WAS NOTHING TO 

189
00:06:08,701 --> 00:06:10,135
INVESTIGATE FROM AT LEAST ONE 

190
00:06:10,135 --> 00:06:10,503
STANDPOINT. 

191
00:06:10,503 --> 00:06:11,837
THEY DIDN'T KNOW THE LOCATION, 

192
00:06:11,837 --> 00:06:13,005
THE TIME, THE YEAR AND THEY 

193
00:06:13,005 --> 00:06:16,676
DIDN'T KNOW ANYTHING. 

194
00:06:16,676 --> 00:06:19,512
IT'S LIKE, WHERE DO YOU GO. 

195
00:06:19,512 --> 00:06:21,046
ALSO, IT'S NOT FOR THE FBI IF 

196
00:06:21,046 --> 00:06:22,548
YOU LOOK AT WHAT JOE BIDEN 

197
00:06:22,548 --> 00:06:22,748
SAID. 

198
00:06:22,748 --> 00:06:24,050
HE SAID THEY DON'T DO THIS AND 

199
00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:27,887
HE SAID IT VERY CLEARLY. 

200
00:06:27,887 --> 00:06:29,222
I THINK WHEN YOU LOOK AT IT 

201
00:06:29,222 --> 00:06:30,456
ALL, IT'S NOT GOING TO CHANGE 

202
00:06:30,456 --> 00:06:35,661
AND THEY OF THE DEMOCRATS 

203
00:06:35,661 --> 00:06:35,894
MINDS. 

204
00:06:35,894 --> 00:06:36,395
THEIR OBSTRUCTIONISTS. 

205
00:06:36,395 --> 00:06:36,962
THERE ACTUALLY CON ARTISTS 

206
00:06:36,962 --> 00:06:37,963
BECAUSE THEY KNOW HOW QUALITY 

207
00:06:37,963 --> 00:06:43,069
THIS MAN IS. 

208
00:06:43,069 --> 00:06:44,270
THEY WANT TO DESTROY HIS 

209
00:06:44,270 --> 00:06:46,305
REPUTATION AND IN THE MIDTERMS, 

210
00:06:46,305 --> 00:06:47,173
WHAT THEY'VE DONE TO THIS 

211
00:06:47,173 --> 00:06:48,040
FAMILY AND THESE CHILDREN, 

212
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:49,008
THESE BEAUTIFUL CHILDREN OF HIS 

213
00:06:49,008 --> 00:06:52,912
AND WHAT THEY'VE DONE TO HIS 

214
00:06:52,912 --> 00:06:55,648
WIFE -- THEY KNOW IT'S A BIG 

215
00:06:55,648 --> 00:06:55,981
FAT CON JOB. 

216
00:06:55,981 --> 00:06:57,016
THEY GO INTO A ROOM AND I 

217
00:06:57,016 --> 00:07:00,920
GUARANTEE YOU THEY LAUGH LIKE 

218
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:02,422
HECK AT WHAT THEY PULLED OFF ON 

219
00:07:02,422 --> 00:07:06,792
YOU AND ON THE PUBLIC. 

220
00:07:06,792 --> 00:07:09,061
THEY LAUGHED LIKE OH. 

221
00:07:09,061 --> 00:07:10,263
IT WOULDN'T HAVE MATTERED IF 

222
00:07:10,263 --> 00:07:11,998
THE FBI CAME BACK WITH THE 

223
00:07:11,998 --> 00:07:13,633
CLEANEST SCORE, AND YOU 

224
00:07:13,633 --> 00:07:15,635
UNDERSTAND THAT VERY WELL, 

225
00:07:15,635 --> 00:07:15,835
JOHN. 

226
00:07:15,835 --> 00:07:18,704
OF THEY WOULD HAVE COME BACK 

227
00:07:18,704 --> 00:07:20,306
WITH A MOST PERFECT -- WE FOUND 

228
00:07:20,306 --> 00:07:20,973
EVERYTHING AND HE'S PERFECTLY 

229
00:07:20,973 --> 00:07:21,807
INNOCENT OF EVERYTHING -- 

230
00:07:21,807 --> 00:07:24,176
WOULDN'T HAVE MADE A 

231
00:07:24,176 --> 00:07:24,844
DIFFERENCE. 

232
00:07:24,844 --> 00:07:26,245
HE WOULDN'T HAVE ONE VOTE. 

233
00:07:26,245 --> 00:07:27,079
WE WILL GET VOTES FROM THE 

234
00:07:27,079 --> 00:07:29,081
DEMOCRATS IF WE WIN. 

235
00:07:29,081 --> 00:07:30,416
YOU'LL HAVE THREE, FOUR OR FIVE 

236
00:07:30,416 --> 00:07:36,422
DEMOCRATS GIVING US VOTES 

237
00:07:36,422 --> 00:07:38,291
BECAUSE THEY WERE IN STATES I 

238
00:07:38,291 --> 00:07:39,559
WON BY 30 AND 40 POINTS AND 

239
00:07:39,559 --> 00:07:40,793
THEY WILL GIVE US VOTES. 

240
00:07:40,793 --> 00:07:41,427
OTHER THAN THAT YOU PROBABLY 

241
00:07:41,427 --> 00:07:44,931
WON'T GET ANY. 

242
00:07:44,931 --> 00:07:47,767
GO AHEAD. 

243
00:07:47,767 --> 00:07:49,335
>> MR. PRESIDENT, THERE ARE IN 

244
00:07:49,335 --> 00:07:50,470
ALL THREE WOMEN ACCUSING JUDGE 

245
00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:51,804
KAVANAUGH OF SEXUAL MISCONDUCT. 

246
00:07:51,804 --> 00:07:53,940
ARE YOU SAYING THAT ALL THREE 

247
00:07:53,940 --> 00:07:55,608
OF THOSE WOMEN ARE LIARS? 

248
00:07:55,608 --> 00:07:56,976
IS THERE ANYTHING THAT COULD BE 

249
00:07:56,976 --> 00:07:58,311
SAID TOMORROW THAT COULD CAUSE 

250
00:07:58,311 --> 00:08:00,212
YOU TO WITHDRAW THE NOMINATION, 

251
00:08:00,212 --> 00:08:00,680
ANYTHING AT ALL? 

252
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:04,517
>> I WON'T GET INTO THAT GAME. I

253
00:08:04,517 --> 00:08:05,250
ONLY TELL YOU THIS. 

254
00:08:05,250 --> 00:08:06,486
THIS IS ONE OF THE HIGHEST 

255
00:08:06,486 --> 00:08:07,353
QUALITY PEOPLE THAT I'VE EVER 

256
00:08:07,353 --> 00:08:08,287
MET AND EVERYBODY THAT KNOWS 

257
00:08:08,287 --> 00:08:09,855
HIM SAYS THE SAME THING. 

258
00:08:09,855 --> 00:08:19,065
THESE ARE ALL FALSE, TO ME. 

259
00:08:19,065 --> 00:08:21,000
THESE ARE FALSE ACCUSATIONS IN 

260
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:21,867
CERTAIN CASES AND CERTAIN 

261
00:08:21,867 --> 00:08:22,735
CASES, EVEN THE MEDIA AGREES 

262
00:08:22,735 --> 00:08:23,035
WITH THAT. 

263
00:08:23,035 --> 00:08:27,006
I CAN ONLY SAME THAT WHAT 

264
00:08:27,006 --> 00:08:28,306
THEY'VE DONE TO THIS MAN IS 

265
00:08:28,306 --> 00:08:32,912
INCREDIBLE. 

266
00:08:32,912 --> 00:08:34,679
IT'S VERY INTERESTING. I 

267
00:08:34,679 --> 00:08:35,581
PICK A LOT OF JUDGES. 

268
00:08:35,581 --> 00:08:36,982
I HAVE 145 JUDGES I WILL BE 

269
00:08:36,982 --> 00:08:42,421
PICKING BY THE END OF ASSURE -- 

270
00:08:42,421 --> 00:08:43,823
AND OF A SHORT PERIOD OF TIME. 

271
00:08:43,823 --> 00:08:44,924
PRESIDENT OBAMA WASN'T BIG ON 

272
00:08:44,924 --> 00:08:46,892
PICKING JUDGES AND I SAID, HOW 

273
00:08:46,892 --> 00:08:47,660
IS THIS POSSIBLE? 

274
00:08:47,660 --> 00:08:49,061
I HAVE 145 INCLUDING COURT OF 

275
00:08:49,061 --> 00:08:53,165
APPEALS JUDGES. 

276
00:08:53,165 --> 00:08:55,034
THEY JUST DIDN'T DO IT. 

277
00:08:55,034 --> 00:08:56,369
DO YOU KNOW WHY? 

278
00:08:56,369 --> 00:08:57,302
THEY GOT TIRED. 

279
00:08:57,302 --> 00:08:58,604
THEY GOT COMPLACENT. 

280
00:08:58,604 --> 00:09:00,272
SOMETHING HAPPEN. I 

281
00:09:00,272 --> 00:09:01,507
HAVE 145 JUDGES. 

282
00:09:01,507 --> 00:09:04,777
EVERYBODY WANTS TO BE A FEDERAL 

283
00:09:04,777 --> 00:09:06,379
JUDGE, NOT JUST A SUPREME COURT 

284
00:09:06,379 --> 00:09:06,612
JUDGE. 

285
00:09:06,612 --> 00:09:08,180
I'M TALKING ABOUT COURT OF 

286
00:09:08,180 --> 00:09:08,713
APPEALS, DISTRICT COURT. 

287
00:09:08,713 --> 00:09:10,716
I DON'T THINK THEY WILL WANT TO 

288
00:09:10,716 --> 00:09:10,982
SO MUCH. 

289
00:09:10,982 --> 00:09:12,752
I WILL CALL PEOPLE AND WE WILL 

290
00:09:12,752 --> 00:09:13,986
HAVE PEOPLE CALLING PEOPLE WHO 

291
00:09:13,986 --> 00:09:15,721
DO THIS AND PEOPLE ARE GOING TO 

292
00:09:15,721 --> 00:09:16,788
BE SCARED BECAUSE WE COULD SAY 

293
00:09:16,788 --> 00:09:17,356
IT ABOUT YOU. 

294
00:09:17,356 --> 00:09:20,726
35 YEARS AGO AND YOU MIGHT NOT 

295
00:09:20,726 --> 00:09:28,601
KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON. WHAT IS 

296
00:09:28,601 --> 00:09:31,003
GOING ON AND WHY DID THEY WAIT? 

297
00:09:31,003 --> 00:09:31,871
WHY DID SENATOR FEINSTEIN WAIT 

298
00:09:31,871 --> 00:09:32,738
UNTIL THE HEARINGS WERE OVER 

299
00:09:32,738 --> 00:09:33,438
AND MAKE THIS CASE? 

300
00:09:33,438 --> 00:09:35,073
WHY DIDN'T SHE BRING IT AT THE 

301
00:09:35,073 --> 00:09:41,981
BEGINNING? 

302
00:09:41,981 --> 00:09:42,815
WHY DIDN'T THEY BRING THIS 

303
00:09:42,815 --> 00:09:44,716
RIGHT AT THE BEGINNING DURING 

304
00:09:44,716 --> 00:09:45,651
THE HEARING? 

305
00:09:45,651 --> 00:09:47,386
THEY WOULD HAVE HAD ALL THE 

306
00:09:47,386 --> 00:09:49,321
TIME IN THE WORLD FOR THE FBI. 

307
00:09:49,321 --> 00:09:51,757
THE FBI DID INVESTIGATE THIS 

308
00:09:51,757 --> 00:09:54,060
TIME AS THEY HAVE FIVE OR SIX 

309
00:09:54,060 --> 00:09:56,095
OTHER TIMES AND THEY DID A VERY 

310
00:09:56,095 --> 00:09:56,595
THOROUGH INVESTIGATION. 

311
00:09:56,595 --> 00:09:58,064
BUT, THIS IS A BIG CON JOB AND 

312
00:09:58,064 --> 00:09:59,365
I WOULD LOVE TO BE IN THE ROOM 

313
00:09:59,365 --> 00:10:01,033
WITH THE DEMOCRATS, CLOSE THE 

314
00:10:01,033 --> 00:10:06,539
DOOR AND YOU GUYS ARE ALL THE 

315
00:10:06,539 --> 00:10:07,707
WAY OUTSIDE WAITING AND SCHUMER 

316
00:10:07,707 --> 00:10:09,075

00:10:09,075 --> 00:10:14,413
THERE LAUGHING. HOW THEY FOOLED 

318
00:10:14,413 --> 00:10:15,081
YOU ALL. 

319
00:10:15,081 --> 00:10:16,916
LET'S JUST STOP THEM. 

320
00:10:16,916 --> 00:10:19,285
A BIG FAT CON. 

321
00:10:19,285 --> 00:10:20,820
>> MR. PRESIDENT, YOU HAVE 

322
00:10:20,820 --> 00:10:21,120
DAUGHTERS. 

323
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:22,621
AND YOU UNDERSTAND WHY A VICTIM 

324
00:10:22,621 --> 00:10:23,823
OF SEXUAL ASSAULT WOULD NOT 

325
00:10:23,823 --> 00:10:25,625
REPORT IT AT THE TIME? 

326
00:10:25,625 --> 00:10:26,125
DON'T YOU UNDERSTAND? 

327
00:10:26,125 --> 00:10:27,827
>> BY THE WAY, I ONLY SAY THIS. 

328
00:10:27,827 --> 00:10:33,833
36 YEARS, NO CHARGE, NO 

329
00:10:33,833 --> 00:10:34,366
NOTHING. 

330
00:10:34,366 --> 00:10:36,035
EVERYBODY -- >> THAT HAPPENS 

331
00:10:36,035 --> 00:10:36,268
OFTEN. 

332
00:10:36,268 --> 00:10:39,572
>> PEOPLE HAVE TO MAKE A 

333
00:10:39,572 --> 00:10:39,839
DECISION. 

334
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:41,240
36 YEARS, NO CHARGE AND ALL OF 

335
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:42,241
A SUDDEN THE HEARINGS ARE OVER 

336
00:10:42,241 --> 00:10:43,175
AND THE RUMORS START COMING OUT 

337
00:10:43,175 --> 00:10:44,810
AND THEN YOU HAVE THIS OTHER 

338
00:10:44,810 --> 00:10:50,249
CON ARTIST ARTIST, AVENATTI, 

339
00:10:50,249 --> 00:10:51,283
COME OUT WITH ANOTHER BEAUTY 

340
00:10:51,283 --> 00:10:52,017
TODAY. I 

341
00:10:52,017 --> 00:10:54,019
ALWAYS SAY THAT YOU HAVE TO 

342
00:10:54,019 --> 00:10:54,653
LOOK AT THE FACTS. 

343
00:10:54,653 --> 00:10:56,288
THE SENATORS ARE VERY CAPABLE 

344
00:10:56,288 --> 00:10:57,890
PEOPLE, VERY GOOD PEOPLE. I 

345
00:10:57,890 --> 00:10:59,992
KNOW MANY OF THEM AND THEY ARE 

346
00:10:59,992 --> 00:11:00,526
FRIENDS OF MINE. 

347
00:11:00,526 --> 00:11:01,694
THESE ARE VERY TALENTED, VERY 

348
00:11:01,694 --> 00:11:03,062
GOOD PEOPLE AND THEY ARE GOING 

349
00:11:03,062 --> 00:11:03,329
TO VOTE. 

350
00:11:03,329 --> 00:11:04,296
THEY HAVE TO BELIEVE WHAT THEY 

351
00:11:04,296 --> 00:11:04,563
BELIEVE. 

352
00:11:04,563 --> 00:11:13,305
WHEN I LOOK AT WHAT'S HAPPENED 

353
00:11:13,305 --> 00:11:14,340
TO THE REPUTATION OF A GREAT 

354
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:15,541
GENTLEMAN, A GREAT INTELLECT, A 

355
00:11:15,541 --> 00:11:16,609
BRILLIANT MAN AND SOMEBODY THAT 

356
00:11:16,609 --> 00:11:21,013
HAS A CHANCE TO BE ONE OF OUR 

357
00:11:21,013 --> 00:11:22,381
GREAT SUPREME COURT JUSTICES IN 

358
00:11:22,381 --> 00:11:22,948
HISTORY, INTELLECTUALLY, I 

359
00:11:22,948 --> 00:11:25,451
THINK IT'S A SHAME. 

360
00:11:25,451 --> 00:11:25,651
YES? 

361
00:11:25,651 --> 00:11:33,993
>> MR. PRESIDENT, YESTERDAY AT 

362
00:11:33,993 --> 00:11:35,861
THE SPEECH AT THE U.N., YOU 

363
00:11:35,861 --> 00:11:37,196
SPOKE ABOUT HOW VENEZUELA'S 

364
00:11:37,196 --> 00:11:40,266
PROBLEM WAS BECAUSE OF CUBA AND 

365
00:11:40,266 --> 00:11:43,169
THE CASTRO'S AND HOW THEY WENT 

366
00:11:43,169 --> 00:11:54,146
IN AND BROUGHT SOCIALISM AND 

367
00:11:54,146 --> 00:11:54,947
COMMUNISM TO VENEZUELA AND NOW 

368
00:11:54,947 --> 00:11:55,447
TO NICARAGUA, AS WELL. 

369
00:11:55,447 --> 00:11:56,582
MR. PRESIDENT, ARE YOU GOING TO 

370
00:11:56,582 --> 00:11:57,550
BE MORE PROACTIVE NOW AGAINST 

371
00:11:57,550 --> 00:11:57,950
CUBA, AS WELL? 

372
00:11:57,950 --> 00:11:58,818
>> I'VE BEEN VERY PROACTIVE 

373
00:11:58,818 --> 00:11:59,151
AGAINST CUBA. 

374
00:11:59,151 --> 00:12:00,085
I DON'T LIKE WHAT'S HAPPENING 

375
00:12:00,085 --> 00:12:00,352
IN CUBA. 

376
00:12:00,352 --> 00:12:01,854
AS YOU KNOW, PRESIDENT OBAMA 

377
00:12:01,854 --> 00:12:03,456
GAVE THEM A PASS AND I DIDN'T 

378
00:12:03,456 --> 00:12:03,756
LIKE IT. 

379
00:12:03,756 --> 00:12:04,623
NEITHER DO CUBAN PEOPLE BASED 

380
00:12:04,623 --> 00:12:05,858
IN MIAMI AND OUR COUNTRY WHO 

381
00:12:05,858 --> 00:12:06,859
CAME FROM CUBA AND SUFFERED 

382
00:12:06,859 --> 00:12:07,159
FROM CUBA. 

383
00:12:07,159 --> 00:12:08,227
I DON'T LIKE WHAT HE DID AND 

384
00:12:08,227 --> 00:12:09,461
I'VE ENDED MUCH OF IT, MOST OF 

385
00:12:09,461 --> 00:12:10,229
IT. 

386
00:12:10,229 --> 00:12:16,368
I DON'T LIKE WHAT'S HAPPENING 

387
00:12:16,368 --> 00:12:17,903
IN CUBA AND I CERTAINLY DON'T 

388
00:12:17,903 --> 00:12:18,770
LIKE WHAT'S HAPPENING IN 

389
00:12:18,770 --> 00:12:19,071
VENEZUELA. 

390
00:12:19,071 --> 00:12:20,139
>> MR. PRESIDENT, JUST TO 

391
00:12:20,139 --> 00:12:21,373
FINISH, YOU SAID ALSO THAT YOU 

392
00:12:21,373 --> 00:12:25,010
HAD A CALL TO ACTION TO ASK THE 

393
00:12:25,010 --> 00:12:26,846
LEADERS AROUND THE WORLD TO 

394
00:12:26,846 --> 00:12:27,279
ALSO AND SOCIALISM. 

395
00:12:27,279 --> 00:12:28,980
WOULD YOU LIKE TO BE 

396
00:12:28,980 --> 00:12:29,281
RECOGNIZED? 

397
00:12:29,281 --> 00:12:30,883
>> I WOULDN'T SAY THAT 

398
00:12:30,883 --> 00:12:31,951
SOCIALISM HAS BEEN WORKING 

399
00:12:31,951 --> 00:12:33,018
REALLY WELL AROUND THE WORLD. 

400
00:12:33,018 --> 00:12:33,218
OKAY? 

401
00:12:33,218 --> 00:12:36,655
YOU CAN TAKE A LOOK AT VENEZUELA

402
00:12:36,655 --> 00:12:39,258
AS THEIR NUMBER ONE, THE ONE 

403
00:12:39,258 --> 00:12:40,893
MOST OBVIOUS BUT TAKE A LOOK 

404
00:12:40,893 --> 00:12:46,031
AROUND THE WORLD AND SOCIALISM 

405
00:12:46,031 --> 00:12:47,066
 

406
00:12:47,066 --> 00:12:52,771
>> IF YOU DON'T MIND, AFTER I'M 

407
00:12:52,771 --> 00:12:56,308
FINISHED, IF WEIJIA JIANG OR ONE

408
00:12:56,308 --> 00:12:58,410
OF OUR FEMALE COLLEAGUES COULD 

409
00:12:58,410 --> 00:12:59,812
GO AFTER ME, THAT WOULD BE 

410
00:12:59,812 --> 00:13:00,045
GREAT. 

411
00:13:00,045 --> 00:13:01,080
MR. PRESIDENT, TO FOLLOW UP ON 

412
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:02,014
THE ALLEGATIONS -- 

413
00:13:02,014 --> 00:13:05,084
>> WHAT DOES HE MEAN BY THAT? 

414
00:13:05,084 --> 00:13:06,218
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN? 

415
00:13:06,218 --> 00:13:08,320
>> IF IT WOULD BE GREAT IF A 

416
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:08,620
FEMALE -- 

417
00:13:08,620 --> 00:13:10,556
>> WHAT DOES THAT MEAN? 

418
00:13:10,556 --> 00:13:11,991
>> OF A FEMALE REPORTER WOULD 

419
00:13:11,991 --> 00:13:13,092
ASK A QUESTION ABOUT THIS 

420
00:13:13,092 --> 00:13:13,325
ISSUE. 

421
00:13:13,325 --> 00:13:17,196
>> I WOULDN'T MIND THAT AT ALL. 

422
00:13:17,196 --> 00:13:19,031
WOULDN'T MAKE ANY DIFFERENCE TO 

423
00:13:19,031 --> 00:13:19,765
ME. 

424
00:13:19,765 --> 00:13:20,032
GO AHEAD. 

425
00:13:20,032 --> 00:13:23,168
>> IF I COULD FOLLOW UP ON JOHN 

426
00:13:23,168 --> 00:13:24,203
AND JOHN'S QUESTION. 

427
00:13:24,203 --> 00:13:25,804
WHY IS IT, MR. PRESIDENT, THAT 

428
00:13:25,804 --> 00:13:28,040
YOU ALWAYS SEEM TO SIDE WITH 

429
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:30,242
THE ACCUSED AND NOT THE 

430
00:13:30,242 --> 00:13:30,508
ACCUSER? 

431
00:13:30,508 --> 00:13:32,678
YOU HAVE THREE WOMEN HERE WHO 

432
00:13:32,678 --> 00:13:34,780
ARE ALL MAKING ALLEGATIONS, ALL 

433
00:13:34,780 --> 00:13:37,182
ASKING THAT THEIR STORIES BE 

434
00:13:37,182 --> 00:13:37,415
HEARD. 

435
00:13:37,415 --> 00:13:40,219
IF YOU LOOK AT THE CASE OF ROY 

436
00:13:40,219 --> 00:13:42,188
MOORE, THE CASE OF ONE OF YOUR 

437
00:13:42,188 --> 00:13:44,623
STAFFERS, YOU SEEM TO TIME AND 

438
00:13:44,623 --> 00:13:46,825
AGAIN SIDE WITH THE ACCUSED AND 

439
00:13:46,825 --> 00:13:47,225
NOT THE ACCUSER. 

440
00:13:47,225 --> 00:13:48,494
IS THAT BECAUSE OF THE MANY 

441
00:13:48,494 --> 00:13:50,462
ALLEGATIONS THAT YOU'VE HAD 

442
00:13:50,462 --> 00:13:52,297
MADE AGAINST YOU OVER THE 

443
00:13:52,297 --> 00:13:52,530
YEARS? 

444
00:13:52,530 --> 00:13:56,936
>> FIRST OF ALL, I WASN'T HAPPY 

445
00:13:56,936 --> 00:13:58,403
WITH ROY MOORE. 

446
00:13:58,403 --> 00:13:59,638
LET'S GET THAT STRAIGHT. 

447
00:13:59,638 --> 00:14:00,906
ROY MOORE WAS A REPUBLICAN 

448
00:14:00,906 --> 00:14:02,241
CANDIDATE AND I WOULD HAVE 

449
00:14:02,241 --> 00:14:03,342
RATHER HAD A REPUBLICAN 

450
00:14:03,342 --> 00:14:04,143
CANDIDATE. 

451
00:14:04,143 --> 00:14:05,878
I WAS VERY HAPPY WITH LUTHER 

452
00:14:05,878 --> 00:14:07,413
STRANGE, A TERRIFIC MAN FROM 

453
00:14:07,413 --> 00:14:12,384
ALABAMA BUT LUTHER STRANGE HAD 

454
00:14:12,384 --> 00:14:14,319
A LOT OF THINGS GOING AGAINST 

455
00:14:14,319 --> 00:14:14,620
HIM. 

456
00:14:14,620 --> 00:14:17,589
AS FAR AS WOMEN, WHETHER A MAN 

457
00:14:17,589 --> 00:14:19,625
OR WOMAN, IT CAN HAPPEN THE 

458
00:14:19,625 --> 00:14:20,059
OTHER WAY. 

459
00:14:20,059 --> 00:14:21,794
ALLEGATIONS CAN GO THE OTHER 

460
00:14:21,794 --> 00:14:22,194
WAY. 

461
00:14:22,194 --> 00:14:23,362
YOU UNDERSTAND THAT AND WHETHER 

462
00:14:23,362 --> 00:14:26,231
IT WAS A MAN OR A WOMAN, 30 

463
00:14:26,231 --> 00:14:28,200
YEARS AGO, 36 YEARS AGO -- IN 

464
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:29,668
FACT, THEY DON'T KNOW HOW MANY 

465
00:14:29,668 --> 00:14:31,303
YEARS AGO BECAUSE NOBODY KNOWS 

466
00:14:31,303 --> 00:14:32,570
WHAT THE TIME IS. 

467
00:14:32,570 --> 00:14:33,906
THAT IS A LONG TIME. 

468
00:14:33,906 --> 00:14:36,842
AS AN EXAMPLE, AND HOPEFULLY I 

469
00:14:36,842 --> 00:14:38,444
WON'T HAVE TO DO IT AS A 

470
00:14:38,444 --> 00:14:39,111
REPLACEMENT, BECAUSE HOPEFULLY, 

471
00:14:39,111 --> 00:14:40,913
THIS IS GOING TO GO VERY WELL 

472
00:14:40,913 --> 00:14:44,917
ON THURSDAY AND GO VERY WELL ON 

473
00:14:44,917 --> 00:14:46,552
MONDAY OR SATURDAY OR SUNDAY OR 

474
00:14:46,552 --> 00:14:47,019
WHENEVER THEY VOTE. 

475
00:14:47,019 --> 00:14:48,287
BUT, I COULD PICK A WOMAN AND 

476
00:14:48,287 --> 00:14:51,256
SHE COULD HAVE CHARGES MADE 

477
00:14:51,256 --> 00:14:52,357
FROM MANY YEARS AGO, ALSO. 

478
00:14:52,357 --> 00:14:57,029
I WOULD LOOK AT THE CHARACTER. 

479
00:14:57,029 --> 00:14:59,698
WHAT I HAVE TO DO -- >> THEY 

480
00:14:59,698 --> 00:15:01,133
ARE RELUCTANT TO COME FORWARD 

481
00:15:01,133 --> 00:15:02,401
AND YOU'VE RAISED DOUBTS ABOUT 

482
00:15:02,401 --> 00:15:03,168
THE ACCUSERS. 

483
00:15:03,168 --> 00:15:05,237
>> I DON'T THINK PEOPLE ARE 

484
00:15:05,237 --> 00:15:06,171
RELUCTANT TO COME FORWARD. 

485
00:15:06,171 --> 00:15:07,572
THEY HAVE A CHANCE TO SPEAK. 

486
00:15:07,572 --> 00:15:07,872
EXCUSE ME. 

487
00:15:07,872 --> 00:15:10,609
THEY HAVE A MAJOR CHANCE TO 

488
00:15:10,609 --> 00:15:13,012
SPEAK. IT WILL BE TOMORROW, I 

489
00:15:13,012 --> 00:15:18,417
ASSUME. 

490
00:15:18,417 --> 00:15:19,485
WE'VE DELAYED THIS -- MEANING 

491
00:15:19,485 --> 00:15:20,819
THE REPUBLICAN SENATORS, NOT ME 

492
00:15:20,819 --> 00:15:21,954
-- THE REPUBLICAN SENATORS HAVE 

493
00:15:21,954 --> 00:15:26,759
DELAYED THIS FOR WEEKS, NOW. 

494
00:15:26,759 --> 00:15:28,260
THEY ARE GIVING THE WOMEN A 

495
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:30,462
MAJOR CHANCE TO SPEAK. 

496
00:15:30,462 --> 00:15:32,298
NOW, IT'S POSSIBLE I WILL HEAR 

497
00:15:32,298 --> 00:15:34,700
THAT AND I WILL SAY, I'M 

498
00:15:34,700 --> 00:15:35,100
CHANGING MY MIND. 

499
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:36,468
THAT IS POSSIBLE. 

500
00:15:36,468 --> 00:15:38,170
WE WANT TO GIVE THEM A CHANCE 

501
00:15:38,170 --> 00:15:40,539
TO SPEAK AND THEY ARE GIVEN -- 

502
00:15:40,539 --> 00:15:40,939
>> ALL THREE? 3

503
00:15:40,939 --> 00:15:43,008
>> WELL, WHOEVER IS GIVEN A 

504
00:15:43,008 --> 00:15:43,241
CHANCE. 

505
00:15:43,241 --> 00:15:45,144
WE'VE DELAYED IT A LONG TIME 

506
00:15:45,144 --> 00:15:47,880
BUT THEY WILL HAVE A BIG SHOT 

507
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:48,813
AT SPEAKING AND MAKING THEIR 

508
00:15:48,813 --> 00:15:49,047
CASE. 

509
00:15:49,047 --> 00:15:50,015
YOU KNOW WHAT? 

510
00:15:50,015 --> 00:15:50,883
I COULD BE PERSUADED, ALSO, 

511
00:15:50,883 --> 00:15:51,617
OKAY? 

512
00:15:51,617 --> 00:15:56,922
PLEASE GO AHEAD. 

513
00:15:56,922 --> 00:16:01,994
>> THANK YOU, MR. PRESIDENT. 

514
00:16:01,994 --> 00:16:03,395
A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS TO FOLLOW-

515
00:16:03,395 --> 00:16:04,930
UP ON ANSWERS I DIDN'T QUITE 

516
00:16:04,930 --> 00:16:06,365
HEAR FROM YOU IF YOU WOULD 

517
00:16:06,365 --> 00:16:08,233
ALLOW ME A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS. 

518
00:16:08,233 --> 00:16:10,502
FIST OF ALL, DO YOU THINK 

519
00:16:10,502 --> 00:16:12,037
THESE WOMEN, ALL THREE OF THEM, 

520
00:16:12,037 --> 00:16:12,871
ARE LIARS? 

521
00:16:12,871 --> 00:16:14,206
>> ARE THEY WHAT? 

522
00:16:14,206 --> 00:16:14,473
>> LIARS. 

523
00:16:14,473 --> 00:16:15,907
>> I CAN'T TELL YOU. I 

524
00:16:15,907 --> 00:16:17,710
HAVE TO WATCH TOMORROW. I 

525
00:16:17,710 --> 00:16:19,311
JUST HEARD ABOUT ONE OF THEM A 

526
00:16:19,311 --> 00:16:20,612
LITTLE WHILE AGO. I 

527
00:16:20,612 --> 00:16:22,681
CAN TELL YOU HER LAWYER IS A 

528
00:16:22,681 --> 00:16:23,214
LOW LIFE. I 

529
00:16:23,214 --> 00:16:25,050
CAN'T TELL YOU ABOUT THE LIES 

530
00:16:25,050 --> 00:16:26,752
UNTIL I HEAR THEM. I 

531
00:16:26,752 --> 00:16:28,387
DON'T KNOW WHAT HAPPENED TODAY 

532
00:16:28,387 --> 00:16:30,055
BECAUSE I'VE BEEN BUSY WITH 

533
00:16:30,055 --> 00:16:31,590
JAPAN, SOUTH KOREA, CHINA AND 

534
00:16:31,590 --> 00:16:33,792
ABOUT SEVEN OTHER COUNTRIES, AS 

535
00:16:33,792 --> 00:16:35,727
YOU KNOW AND I CHAIRED THE 

536
00:16:35,727 --> 00:16:36,528
SECURITY COUNCIL. I 

537
00:16:36,528 --> 00:16:37,929
DON'T KNOW ABOUT TODAY'S PERSON 

538
00:16:37,929 --> 00:16:39,064
THAT CAME FORWARD. 

539
00:16:39,064 --> 00:16:40,699
I DO KNOW ABOUT THE LAWYER AND 

540
00:16:40,699 --> 00:16:43,602
YOU DON'T GET MUCH WORSE BAD 

541
00:16:43,602 --> 00:16:45,204
REPUTATION TO TAKE A LOOK AT 

542
00:16:45,204 --> 00:16:45,537
HIS PAST. 

543
00:16:45,537 --> 00:16:47,873
AS FAR AS THE OTHER WOMEN ARE 

544
00:16:47,873 --> 00:16:50,476
CONCERNED, I'M GOING TO SEE 

545
00:16:50,476 --> 00:16:51,043
WHAT HAPPENS TOMORROW. 

546
00:16:51,043 --> 00:16:52,010
I'M GOING TO BE WATCHING, 

547
00:16:52,010 --> 00:16:52,978
BELIEVE IT OR NOT. 

548
00:16:52,978 --> 00:16:56,448
I'M GOING TO SEE WHAT IS SAID. 

549
00:16:56,448 --> 00:16:57,950
IT'S POSSIBLE THAT THEY WILL BE 

550
00:16:57,950 --> 00:16:58,317
CONVINCING. 

551
00:16:58,317 --> 00:17:02,121
NOW, WITH ALL OF THAT BEING 

552
00:17:02,121 --> 00:17:04,789
SAID, JUDGE BRETT KAVANAUGH HAS 

553
00:17:04,789 --> 00:17:07,126
BEEN, FOR MANY YEARS, ONE OF 

554
00:17:07,126 --> 00:17:08,393
THE MOST RESPECTED PEOPLE IN 

555
00:17:08,393 --> 00:17:08,694
WASHINGTON. 

556
00:17:08,694 --> 00:17:11,663
HE'S BEEN ON -- I GUESS YOU 

557
00:17:11,663 --> 00:17:13,464
WOULD CALL IT -- THE SECOND 

558
00:17:13,464 --> 00:17:15,233
HIGHEST COURT AND EVERY SINGLE 

559
00:17:15,233 --> 00:17:17,403
PERSON THAT KNOWS HIM -- AND 

560
00:17:17,403 --> 00:17:19,070
PEOPLE KNOW HIM WELL -- THOSE 

561
00:17:19,070 --> 00:17:20,405
PEOPLE DON'T BELIEVE WHAT'S 

562
00:17:20,405 --> 00:17:20,672
GOING ON. 

563
00:17:20,672 --> 00:17:21,940
I CAN ALWAYS BE CONVINCED. 

564
00:17:21,940 --> 00:17:22,973
I HAVE TO HEAR IT. 

565
00:17:22,973 --> 00:17:25,377
>> IT SOUNDS LIKE WHAT YOU ARE 

566
00:17:25,377 --> 00:17:26,411
SAYING THAT THERE IS A 

567
00:17:26,411 --> 00:17:29,047
SITUATION, A SCENARIO, UNDER 

568
00:17:29,047 --> 00:17:31,116
WITH -- UNDER WHICH HE WOULD 

569
00:17:31,116 --> 00:17:31,950
WITHDRAW BRETT KAVANAUGH'S 

570
00:17:31,950 --> 00:17:32,451
NOMINATION? 

571
00:17:32,451 --> 00:17:32,851
IS THAT CORRECT? 

572
00:17:32,851 --> 00:17:35,254
>> IF I THOUGHT HE WAS GUILTY 

573
00:17:35,254 --> 00:17:36,888
ABOUT SOMETHING LIKE THAT, YES, 

574
00:17:36,888 --> 00:17:37,088
SURE. 

575
00:17:37,088 --> 00:17:39,057
>> HE WILL WAIT UNTIL TOMORROW 

576
00:17:39,057 --> 00:17:39,390
TO DECIDE? 

577
00:17:39,390 --> 00:17:41,026
>> I HOPE I CAN WATCH. 

578
00:17:41,026 --> 00:17:42,361
I'M MEETING WITH A LOT OF 

579
00:17:42,361 --> 00:17:44,396
COUNTRIES TOMORROW BUT IN SOME 

580
00:17:44,396 --> 00:17:46,532
FORM I WILL BE ABLE TO WATCH 

581
00:17:46,532 --> 00:17:48,133
AND I WILL RELY ON SOME VERY 

582
00:17:48,133 --> 00:17:49,201
FAIR AND TALENTED REPUBLICAN 

583
00:17:49,201 --> 00:17:51,069
SENATORS WHO -- LOOK -- IF WE 

584
00:17:51,069 --> 00:17:56,108
BROUGHT GEORGE WASHINGTON HERE 

585
00:17:56,108 --> 00:17:57,709
AND WE SAID, WE HAVE GEORGE 

586
00:17:57,709 --> 00:17:59,078
WASHINGTON, THE DEMOCRATS WOULD 

587
00:17:59,078 --> 00:18:01,146
VOTE AGAINST HIM, JUST SO YOU 

588
00:18:01,146 --> 00:18:01,446
UNDERSTAND. 

589
00:18:01,446 --> 00:18:03,582
HE MAY HAVE HAD A BAD PAST, WHO 

590
00:18:03,582 --> 00:18:03,816
KNOWS. 

591
00:18:03,816 --> 00:18:07,352
HE MAY HAVE HAD SOME 

592
00:18:07,352 --> 00:18:08,253
ACCUSATIONS MADE. 

593
00:18:08,253 --> 00:18:10,756
DIDN'T HE HAVE A COUPLE OF 

594
00:18:10,756 --> 00:18:12,591
THINGS IN HIS PAST? 

595
00:18:12,591 --> 00:18:14,426
GEORGE WASHINGTON WOULD BE VOTED

596
00:18:14,426 --> 00:18:16,828
AGAINST 100% BY SCHUMER AND THE 

597
00:18:16,828 --> 00:18:17,161
CON ARTISTS. 

598
00:18:17,161 --> 00:18:18,597
100%. 

599
00:18:18,597 --> 00:18:21,266
SO, REALLY DOESN'T MATTER FROM 

600
00:18:21,266 --> 00:18:21,666
THEIR STANDPOINT. 

601
00:18:21,666 --> 00:18:23,268
WHEN JOHN ASKED ABOUT THE FBI, 

602
00:18:23,268 --> 00:18:24,803
IF THE FBI DID THE MOST 

603
00:18:24,803 --> 00:18:25,904
THOROUGH INVESTIGATION IN THE 

604
00:18:25,904 --> 00:18:27,072
HISTORY OF THE FBI AND THEY 

605
00:18:27,072 --> 00:18:30,108
FOUND HIM TO BE 100% PERFECT, 

606
00:18:30,108 --> 00:18:31,610
HE WOULD LOSE EVERY SINGLE 

607
00:18:31,610 --> 00:18:31,810
VOTE. 

608
00:18:31,810 --> 00:18:33,912
NOW, IF THE REPUBLICANS WIN 

609
00:18:33,912 --> 00:18:35,380
TOMORROW, I THINK YOU WILL GET 

610
00:18:35,380 --> 00:18:36,715
SOME VOTES FROM THE DEMOCRATS. 

611
00:18:36,715 --> 00:18:37,482
DO YOU KNOW WHY? 

612
00:18:37,482 --> 00:18:38,517
WE ALL KNOW WHY. 

613
00:18:38,517 --> 00:18:40,485
IT'S CALLED POLITICS AND THEN 

614
00:18:40,485 --> 00:18:42,220
YOU'LL PROBABLY GET SOME VOTES. 

615
00:18:42,220 --> 00:18:42,487
LET'S GO. 

616
00:18:42,487 --> 00:18:43,889
ONE MORE QUESTION. 

617
00:18:43,889 --> 00:18:46,725
I'D LIKE TO ASK ABOUT THREE 

618
00:18:46,725 --> 00:18:47,025
QUESTIONS. 

619
00:18:47,025 --> 00:18:47,959
IT'S NOT REALLY FAIR. 

620
00:18:47,959 --> 00:18:50,095
SHOULD I LET HER ASK ANOTHER 

621
00:18:50,095 --> 00:18:50,362
QUESTION? 

622
00:18:50,362 --> 00:18:50,662
GO AHEAD. 

623
00:18:50,662 --> 00:18:52,931
>> TO FOLLOW UP ON A QUESTION A 

624
00:18:52,931 --> 00:18:55,000
COLLEAGUE ASKED ABOUT THE 

625
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,535
BENEFIT OF THE DOUBT THAT YOU 

626
00:18:56,535 --> 00:18:58,270
HAVE GIVEN TO PEOPLE LIKE ROY 

627
00:18:58,270 --> 00:18:59,171
MOORE, ROGER AILES, BILL 

628
00:18:59,171 --> 00:19:00,238
O'REILLY AND BRETT KAVANAUGH. 

629
00:19:00,238 --> 00:19:01,907
THEY ARE ALL MEN. 

630
00:19:01,907 --> 00:19:02,307
WHY IS THAT? 

631
00:19:02,307 --> 00:19:04,943
>> IT'S NOT A BENEFIT OF THE 

632
00:19:04,943 --> 00:19:05,176
DOUBT. 

633
00:19:05,176 --> 00:19:06,378
>> YOU'VE GIVEN THEM THE 

634
00:19:06,378 --> 00:19:07,546
BENEFIT OF THE DOUBT. 

635
00:19:07,546 --> 00:19:10,015
>> I'VE KNOWN THEM A LONG TIME, 

636
00:19:10,015 --> 00:19:11,717
A LOT OF THESE PEOPLE. 

637
00:19:11,717 --> 00:19:13,719
A LOT OF PEOPLE. 

638
00:19:13,719 --> 00:19:14,786
SOME, I'VE BEEN DISAPPOINTED 

639
00:19:14,786 --> 00:19:14,986
WITH. 

640
00:19:14,986 --> 00:19:16,255
I HAVE BEEN DISAPPOINTED WITH 

641
00:19:16,255 --> 00:19:17,222
SOME OTHERS LIKE, YOU KNOW, 

642
00:19:17,222 --> 00:19:18,957
THERE ARE JUDGES THAT ARE WEAK 

643
00:19:18,957 --> 00:19:20,759
BUT I'VE KNOWN PEOPLE FOR A 

644
00:19:20,759 --> 00:19:22,861
LONG TIME AND I NEVER SAW THEM 

645
00:19:22,861 --> 00:19:23,729
DO ANYTHING WRONG. I 

646
00:19:23,729 --> 00:19:24,662
NEVER SAW THEM DO ANYTHING 

647
00:19:24,662 --> 00:19:27,099
WRONG AND THERE ARE SOME THAT I 

648
00:19:27,099 --> 00:19:30,269
AGREE, SOME THAT I'VE BEEN 

649
00:19:30,269 --> 00:19:31,536
WATCHING FOR A LONG TIME. 

650
00:19:31,536 --> 00:19:33,572
IN A COUPLE OF CASES, THEY 

651
00:19:33,572 --> 00:19:34,606
WEREN'T REPUBLICANS AND IN A 

652
00:19:34,606 --> 00:19:36,708
LOT OF CASES THEY WERE NOT. 

653
00:19:36,708 --> 00:19:37,943
THEY WERE EXACTLY THE OPPOSITE 

654
00:19:37,943 --> 00:19:39,678
BUT I'VE BEEN WATCHING THEM FOR 

655
00:19:39,678 --> 00:19:41,813
A LONG TIME AND I KNEW FOR A 

656
00:19:41,813 --> 00:19:43,582
LONG TIME THESE WERE NOT GOOD 

657
00:19:43,582 --> 00:19:44,816
PEOPLE AND THEY WERE NEVER 

658
00:19:44,816 --> 00:19:45,116
BROUGHT UP. 

659
00:19:45,116 --> 00:19:48,586
OKAY -- YES, MA'AM, GO AHEAD. 

660
00:19:48,586 --> 00:19:53,492
>> THANK YOU VERY MUCH, BY THE 

661
00:19:53,492 --> 00:19:55,627
WAY. 

662
00:19:55,627 --> 00:19:58,197
>> MR. PRESIDENT, WHEN THE 

663
00:19:58,197 --> 00:19:59,231
ALLEGATIONS FIRST SURFACED, YOU 

664
00:19:59,231 --> 00:20:00,699
INITIALLY SAID HOW IMPORTANT IT 

665
00:20:00,699 --> 00:20:01,900
WAS FOR DR. FORD TO TESTIFY. 

666
00:20:01,900 --> 00:20:03,969
AND, THAT YOU WANTED TO HEAR 

667
00:20:03,969 --> 00:20:04,236
FROM HER. 

668
00:20:04,236 --> 00:20:05,904
>> I DO. I 

669
00:20:05,904 --> 00:20:07,005
WISH IT COULD'VE GONE QUICKER. 

670
00:20:07,005 --> 00:20:09,207
>> YOU ALSO SAID THAT IF WHAT 

671
00:20:09,207 --> 00:20:11,209
SHE SAID WERE AS BAD AS SHE 

672
00:20:11,209 --> 00:20:14,780
CLAIMS, SURELY HER OR HER 

673
00:20:14,780 --> 00:20:16,148
PARENTS WOULD HAVE REPORTED IT. 

674
00:20:16,148 --> 00:20:17,316
JUST TODAY YOU SAID -- 

675
00:20:17,316 --> 00:20:19,017
>> THERE IS THE TRUTH. 

676
00:20:19,017 --> 00:20:20,919
THERE IS A CHANCE HER PARENTS 

677
00:20:20,919 --> 00:20:22,421
COULD HAVE REPORTED A 36 YEARS 

678
00:20:22,421 --> 00:20:22,621
AGO. 

679
00:20:22,621 --> 00:20:24,423
>> MY QUESTION IS -- 

680
00:20:24,423 --> 00:20:26,825
>> IT DOESN'T MEAN THEY HAD TO 

681
00:20:26,825 --> 00:20:27,125
REPORT IT. 

682
00:20:27,125 --> 00:20:29,628
IN SOME INSTANCES, PEOPLE KEEP 

683
00:20:29,628 --> 00:20:29,895
IT QUIET. 

684
00:20:29,895 --> 00:20:32,397
IT'S A VERY TOUGH SITUATION FOR 

685
00:20:32,397 --> 00:20:34,433
A WOMAN, NO QUESTION AND IN 

686
00:20:34,433 --> 00:20:36,234
SOME CASES THEY DO REPORT IT. 

687
00:20:36,234 --> 00:20:37,869
FRANKLY, HAD THEY REPORTED IT, 

688
00:20:37,869 --> 00:20:38,703
IT WOULD HAVE BEEN PRETTY 

689
00:20:38,703 --> 00:20:39,604
AMAZING, WOULDN'T IT? 

690
00:20:39,604 --> 00:20:41,807
BUT, I GUESS THEY DIDN'T AND 

691
00:20:41,807 --> 00:20:42,240
THAT'S OKAY. 

692
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:44,242
I'M NOT SAYING THEY HAD TO 

693
00:20:44,242 --> 00:20:44,542
REPORT IT. 

694
00:20:44,542 --> 00:20:46,144
IT'S A VERY PERSONAL THING, A 

695
00:20:46,144 --> 00:20:46,978
VERY BIG PROBLEM AND NO 

696
00:20:46,978 --> 00:20:47,879
QUESTION ABOUT IT. 

697
00:20:47,879 --> 00:20:50,515
>> DO YOU WANT TO HEAR HER 

698
00:20:50,515 --> 00:20:50,748
STORY? 

699
00:20:50,748 --> 00:20:53,151
>> I LIKE TO HEAR HER STORY. 

700
00:20:53,151 --> 00:20:55,554
WE ARE GIVING HER TIME. 

701
00:20:55,554 --> 00:20:59,591
THEY WOULD HAVE GIVEN HER TIME 

702
00:20:59,591 --> 00:21:00,025
LAST WEEK. 

703
00:21:00,025 --> 00:21:01,393
THIS IS THE UNITED STATES 

704
00:21:01,393 --> 00:21:01,626
SENATE. 

705
00:21:01,626 --> 00:21:03,161
THIS IS THE MOST IMPORTANT 

706
00:21:03,161 --> 00:21:04,529
POSITION THAT A PRESIDENT CAN 

707
00:21:04,529 --> 00:21:05,664
GIVE VOTE. I 

708
00:21:05,664 --> 00:21:09,034
THINK WE CAN SAY, BY FAR. 

709
00:21:09,034 --> 00:21:10,902
I'VE HEARD IT'S THE MOST 

710
00:21:10,902 --> 00:21:12,738
IMPORTANT DECISION A PRESIDENT 

711
00:21:12,738 --> 00:21:13,038
CAN MAKE. I 

712
00:21:13,038 --> 00:21:14,005
DISAGREE WITH THAT. 

713
00:21:14,005 --> 00:21:16,875
WAR AND PEACE, I ALWAYS SAY WAR 

714
00:21:16,875 --> 00:21:18,310
AND PEACE AND AFTER THAT, 

715
00:21:18,310 --> 00:21:20,011
SUPREME COURT JUSTICE, RIGHT? 

716
00:21:20,011 --> 00:21:21,513
I LOOK FORWARD TO HEARING FROM 

717
00:21:21,513 --> 00:21:21,746
HER. 

718
00:21:21,746 --> 00:21:23,248
WE COULD HAVE HEARD FROM HER 

719
00:21:23,248 --> 00:21:24,883
LAST WEEK AND WE COULD HAVE 

720
00:21:24,883 --> 00:21:27,185
HEARD FROM HER FOR A LONG TIME. 

721
00:21:27,185 --> 00:21:28,553
IT WILL BE INTERESTING TO HEAR 

722
00:21:28,553 --> 00:21:31,022
WHAT SHE HAS TO SAY, OKAY? 

723
00:21:31,022 --> 00:21:32,958
>> LET ME FOLLOW UP ON JIM'S 

724
00:21:32,958 --> 00:21:33,225
QUESTION. 

725
00:21:33,225 --> 00:21:35,961
MR. PRESIDENT, LET ME FOLLOW UP 

726
00:21:35,961 --> 00:21:37,462
ON JIM'S QUESTION THAT WE 

727
00:21:37,462 --> 00:21:39,064
DIDN'T GET AN ANSWER TO. 

728
00:21:39,064 --> 00:21:40,832
>> WHICH QUESTION? 

729
00:21:40,832 --> 00:21:43,101
>> HAVE YOUR PERSONAL 

730
00:21:43,101 --> 00:21:44,002
EXPERIENCES, BEING ACCUSED -- 

731
00:21:44,002 --> 00:21:45,037
>> I'VE BEEN ACCUSED. 

732
00:21:45,037 --> 00:21:47,105
FALSE ACCUSATIONS. 

733
00:21:47,105 --> 00:21:47,873
EXCUSE ME. 

734
00:21:47,873 --> 00:21:49,641
I'VE BEEN ACCUSED AND I WAS 

735
00:21:49,641 --> 00:21:51,276
ACCUSED BY, I BELIEVE IT WAS 

736
00:21:51,276 --> 00:21:51,643
FOUR WOMEN. 

737
00:21:51,643 --> 00:21:54,780
YOU CAN CHECK WITH SEAN HANNITY 

738
00:21:54,780 --> 00:21:56,381
AND YOU CAN CHECK WITH FOX 

739
00:21:56,381 --> 00:21:58,350
BECAUSE THEY COVERED IT VERY 

740
00:21:58,350 --> 00:21:58,617
STRONGLY. 

741
00:21:58,617 --> 00:21:59,251
EXCUSE ME. I 

742
00:21:59,251 --> 00:22:01,286
WAS ACCUSED BY FOUR OR FIVE 

743
00:22:01,286 --> 00:22:03,154
WOMEN WHO GOT PAID A LOT OF 

744
00:22:03,154 --> 00:22:04,556
MONEY TO MAKE UP STORIES ABOUT 

745
00:22:04,556 --> 00:22:04,723
ME. 

746
00:22:04,723 --> 00:22:08,927
WE CAUGHT THEM IN THE 

747
00:22:08,927 --> 00:22:10,462
MAINSTREAM MEDIA AND THEY 

748
00:22:10,462 --> 00:22:11,797
REFUSED TO PUT IT ON 

749
00:22:11,797 --> 00:22:12,964
TELEVISION, REFUSED TO WRITE 

750
00:22:12,964 --> 00:22:13,231
ABOUT IT. 

751
00:22:13,231 --> 00:22:15,934
THEY WERE FOUR WOMEN AND MAYBE 

752
00:22:15,934 --> 00:22:18,170
MORE AND I THINK THE NUMBER IS 

753
00:22:18,170 --> 00:22:18,904
FOUR OR FIVE. 

754
00:22:18,904 --> 00:22:21,206
ONE HAD A MORTGAGE PAID OFF HER 

755
00:22:21,206 --> 00:22:22,441
HOUSE, $52,000 AND ANOTHER ONE 

756
00:22:22,441 --> 00:22:25,877
HAD OTHER THINGS HAPPEN. 

757
00:22:25,877 --> 00:22:28,980
THE ONE THAT REPORTED IT, I 

758
00:22:28,980 --> 00:22:30,048
BELIEVE, WAS OFFERED $750,000 

759
00:22:30,048 --> 00:22:32,884
TO SAY BAD THINGS ABOUT ME AND 

760
00:22:32,884 --> 00:22:35,253
SHE IS THE ONE THAT REPORTED 

761
00:22:35,253 --> 00:22:36,021
IT. 

762
00:22:36,021 --> 00:22:37,389
THIS WOMAN IS INCREDIBLE. 

763
00:22:37,389 --> 00:22:38,823
SHE REPORTED IT INSTEAD OF 

764
00:22:38,823 --> 00:22:40,025
TAKING THE MONEY. 

765
00:22:40,025 --> 00:22:40,725
SO, I'VE HAD NUMEROUS 

766
00:22:40,725 --> 00:22:45,030
ACCUSATIONS ABOUT ME. 

767
00:22:45,030 --> 00:22:46,731
I MEAN, THEY MADE FALSE 

768
00:22:46,731 --> 00:22:47,198
STATEMENTS ABOUT ME. 

769
00:22:47,198 --> 00:22:48,900
KNOWING THEY WERE FALSE. I 

770
00:22:48,900 --> 00:22:49,801
NEVER MET THEM. I 

771
00:22:49,801 --> 00:22:51,536
NEVER MET THESE PEOPLE AND WHAT 

772
00:22:51,536 --> 00:22:54,439
DID THE DO? WHAT DID THEY DO? 

773
00:22:54,439 --> 00:22:57,576
THEY TOOK MONEY IN ORDER TO SAY 

774
00:22:57,576 --> 00:22:58,143
BAD THINGS. 

775
00:22:58,143 --> 00:23:00,112
I'VE HAD STORIES WRITTEN IN THE 

776
00:23:00,112 --> 00:23:02,614
NEW YORK TIMES, FRONT PAGE, 

777
00:23:02,614 --> 00:23:03,548
ABOUT FOUR WOMEN. 

778
00:23:03,548 --> 00:23:04,716
THE WHOLE TOP CENTER FRONT PAGE 

779
00:23:04,716 --> 00:23:06,318
OF THE NEW YORK TIMES. I 

780
00:23:06,318 --> 00:23:08,487
THINK IT WAS FOUR BIG PICTURES. 

781
00:23:08,487 --> 00:23:11,923
I SAID, WOW, THAT'S A BIG 

782
00:23:11,923 --> 00:23:12,290
THING. 

783
00:23:12,290 --> 00:23:12,623
WHAT'S THAT? 

784
00:23:12,623 --> 00:23:14,126
THESE WERE WOMEN QUOTED SAYING 

785
00:23:14,126 --> 00:23:15,193
BAD THINGS ABOUT ME. 

786
00:23:15,193 --> 00:23:17,129
NOT THE WORST THINGS ABOUT ME, 

787
00:23:17,129 --> 00:23:18,597
BUT BAD THINGS. 

788
00:23:18,597 --> 00:23:20,532
I SAID, THAT'S TOO BAD. I 

789
00:23:20,532 --> 00:23:22,801
KNEW THEM A LONG TIME AGO, 15 

790
00:23:22,801 --> 00:23:24,336
YEARS OR 20 YEARS. 

791
00:23:24,336 --> 00:23:24,703
THAT'S TOO BAD. 

792
00:23:24,703 --> 00:23:26,671
I'M SURPRISED AND THEN I SEE 

793
00:23:26,671 --> 00:23:28,607
THEM ON TELEVISION, NOTHING TO 

794
00:23:28,607 --> 00:23:29,775
DO WITH ME. 

795
00:23:29,775 --> 00:23:32,744
THE NEXT DAY OR A DAY LATER, 

796
00:23:32,744 --> 00:23:34,545
THEY WERE INCENSED. 

797
00:23:34,545 --> 00:23:37,549
THEY SAID DONALD TRUMP IS A NICE

798
00:23:37,549 --> 00:23:38,383
GUY. 

799
00:23:38,383 --> 00:23:39,351
WE NEVER SAID THIS. 

800
00:23:39,351 --> 00:23:42,954
THE NEW YORK TIMES DID FALSE 

801
00:23:42,954 --> 00:23:43,254
REPORTING. 

802
00:23:43,254 --> 00:23:44,756
THEY ARE FAKE NEWS AND YOU KNOW 

803
00:23:44,756 --> 00:23:44,956
WHAT? 

804
00:23:44,956 --> 00:23:46,057
THE NEW YORK TIMES WOULD NOT 

805
00:23:46,057 --> 00:23:47,726
REPORT THAT THE STORY WAS FAKE. 

806
00:23:47,726 --> 00:23:49,661
THESE WOMEN SAID GREAT THINGS. 

807
00:23:49,661 --> 00:23:51,796
NOT ONLY DID THEY NOT SAVE THE 

808
00:23:51,796 --> 00:23:52,631
BAD STUFF, THEY SAID GREAT 

809
00:23:52,631 --> 00:24:07,746
THINGS ABOUT ME, FRONT PAGE. 

810
00:24:07,746 --> 00:24:09,181
THOSE WOMEN, THEY ARE 

811
00:24:09,181 --> 00:24:10,115
INCREDIBLE WOMEN, THEY WENT ON 

812
00:24:10,115 --> 00:24:11,383
TELEVISION AND THEY DIDN'T WANT 

813
00:24:11,383 --> 00:24:13,084
TO AND I DIDN'T DO ASK THEM. 

814
00:24:13,084 --> 00:24:14,719
THEY SAID, THE NEW YORK TIMES 

815
00:24:14,719 --> 00:24:15,186
MADE IT OUT. 

816
00:24:15,186 --> 00:24:16,721
THEY GAVE FALSE QUOTES AND THEY 

817
00:24:16,721 --> 00:24:18,089
WENT ON A LOT OF SHOWS. 

818
00:24:18,089 --> 00:24:19,391
THEY WERE INCENSED AND COULDN'T 

819
00:24:19,391 --> 00:24:39,844
BELIEVE IT. 

820
00:24:39,844 --> 00:24:41,212
THAT'S WHY PEOPLE KNOW THAT A 

821
00:24:41,212 --> 00:24:43,415
LOT OF THE NEWS IS FAKE AND A 

822
00:24:43,415 --> 00:24:44,649
LOT OF THE PEOPLE SITTING HERE 

823
00:24:44,649 --> 00:24:45,016
ARE FAKE. 

824
00:24:45,016 --> 00:24:46,518
BUT 20% OF THEM ARE WONDERFUL, 

825
00:24:46,518 --> 00:24:46,851
OKAY? 

826
00:24:46,851 --> 00:24:47,118
GO AHEAD. 

827
00:24:47,118 --> 00:24:48,453
>> MR. TRUMP, YOU DIDN'T LET ME 

828
00:24:48,453 --> 00:24:48,953
ASK MY QUESTION. 

829
00:24:48,953 --> 00:24:50,489
>> YOU'VE BEEN ASKING A 

830
00:24:50,489 --> 00:24:51,022
QUESTION FOR 10 MINUTES. 

831
00:24:51,022 --> 00:24:51,723
PLEASE SIT DOWN. 

832
00:24:51,723 --> 00:24:51,990
GO AHEAD. 

833
00:24:51,990 --> 00:24:53,258
>> HOW DID THAT IMPACT OUR 

834
00:24:53,258 --> 00:24:54,192
OPINIONS ON THE ALLEGATIONS? 

835
00:24:54,192 --> 00:24:55,961
>> IT DOES IMPACT MY OPINION. 

836
00:24:55,961 --> 00:24:56,595
DO YOU KNOW WHY? 

837
00:24:56,595 --> 00:24:58,463
I'VE HAD A LOT OF FALSE CHARGES 

838
00:24:58,463 --> 00:24:58,863
MADE AGAINST ME. 

839
00:24:58,863 --> 00:25:00,332
I'M A VERY FAMOUS PERSON, 

840
00:25:00,332 --> 00:25:00,699
UNFORTUNATELY. 

841
00:25:00,699 --> 00:25:01,700
I'VE BEEN FAMOUS FOR A LONG 

842
00:25:01,700 --> 00:25:03,468
TIME AND I'VE HAD REALLY FALSE 

843
00:25:03,468 --> 00:25:05,036
CHARGES MADE AGAINST ME AND I 

844
00:25:05,036 --> 00:25:06,370
KNOW FRIENDS THAT HAVE HAD 

845
00:25:06,370 --> 00:25:06,938
FALSE CHARGES. 

846
00:25:06,938 --> 00:25:07,472
PEOPLE WANT FAME. 

847
00:25:07,472 --> 00:25:08,206
THEY WANT MONEY. 

848
00:25:08,206 --> 00:25:08,873
THEY WANT WHATEVER. 

849
00:25:08,873 --> 00:25:10,909
SO, WHEN I SEE IT, I VIEW IT 

850
00:25:10,909 --> 00:25:11,843
DIFFERENTLY THAN SOMEONE 

851
00:25:11,843 --> 00:25:12,844
SITTING HOME AND WATCHING 

852
00:25:12,844 --> 00:25:14,179
TELEVISION WHERE THEY SAY, 

853
00:25:14,179 --> 00:25:15,213
JUDGE KAVANAUGH, THIS OR THAT. 

854
00:25:15,213 --> 00:25:16,681
IT'S HAPPENED TO ME MANY TIMES. 

855
00:25:16,681 --> 00:25:18,316
I'VE HAD MANY FALSE CHARGES. I 

856
00:25:18,316 --> 00:25:19,951
HAD A WOMAN SITTING IN AN 

857
00:25:19,951 --> 00:25:21,286
AIRPLANE AND I ATTACKED HER 

858
00:25:21,286 --> 00:25:22,554
WHILE PEOPLE WERE COMING ONTO 

859
00:25:22,554 --> 00:25:24,189
THE PLANE AND I HAVE A NUMBER 

860
00:25:24,189 --> 00:25:25,357
ONE BEST SELLER OUT? 

861
00:25:25,357 --> 00:25:26,992
IT WAS A TOTAL PHONY STORY AND 

862
00:25:26,992 --> 00:25:27,992
THERE ARE MANY OF THEM. 

863
00:25:27,992 --> 00:25:29,494
WHEN YOU SAY DOESN'T AFFECT ME 

864
00:25:29,494 --> 00:25:31,062
IN TERMS OF MY THINKING WITH 

865
00:25:31,062 --> 00:25:32,430
RESPECT TO JUDGE KAVANAUGH, 

866
00:25:32,430 --> 00:25:32,730
ABSOLUTELY. 

867
00:25:32,730 --> 00:25:33,832
BECAUSE, I'VE HAD IT MANY 

868
00:25:33,832 --> 00:25:34,065
TIMES. 

869
00:25:34,065 --> 00:25:35,367
IF THE NEWS WOULD HAVE REPORTED 

870
00:25:35,367 --> 00:25:36,701
THESE FOUR PEOPLE, AND I 

871
00:25:36,701 --> 00:25:38,570
COULDN'T BELIEVE IT -- WHEN I 

872
00:25:38,570 --> 00:25:39,938
HEARD THEY CAUGHT THESE FOUR 

873
00:25:39,938 --> 00:25:41,206
PEOPLE, I SAID, THAT'S A BIG 

874
00:25:41,206 --> 00:25:45,010
STORY AND IT WAS FOR FOX. 

875
00:25:45,010 --> 00:25:45,310
OKAY. 

876
00:25:45,310 --> 00:25:47,012
>> MR. PRESIDENT, EARLIER TODAY 

877
00:25:47,012 --> 00:25:48,380
AND JUST KNOW YOU MADE A 

878
00:25:48,380 --> 00:25:49,047
SIGNIFICANT ALLEGATION AGAINST 

879
00:25:49,047 --> 00:25:50,315
THE CHINESE GOVERNMENT. 

880
00:25:50,315 --> 00:25:55,720
YOU SUGGESTED BUDGET -- YOU 

881
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:56,488
SUGGESTED THE CHINESE HAD 

882
00:25:56,488 --> 00:25:57,622
MEDDLED IN THE ELECTION. 

883
00:25:57,622 --> 00:25:59,658
>> THAT'S WHAT I HEAR. 

884
00:25:59,658 --> 00:26:00,692
>> WHAT EVIDENCE DO YOU HAVE? 

885
00:26:00,692 --> 00:26:01,726
>> WE HAVE EVIDENCE. 

886
00:26:01,726 --> 00:26:03,595
IT WILL COME OUT. I 

887
00:26:03,595 --> 00:26:04,729
CAN'T TELL YOU NOW. 

888
00:26:04,729 --> 00:26:07,299
IT DIDN'T COME OUT OF NOWHERE, 

889
00:26:07,299 --> 00:26:08,867
THAT I CAN'T TELL YOU. 

890
00:26:08,867 --> 00:26:10,168
THEY'VE ADMITTED THEY ARE GOING 

891
00:26:10,168 --> 00:26:10,535
AFTER FARMERS. 

892
00:26:10,535 --> 00:26:12,170
MOST OF YOU CAN COVER THAT. I 

893
00:26:12,170 --> 00:26:13,871
LIKE THAT YOU ARE SHAKING YOUR 

894
00:26:13,871 --> 00:26:15,974
HEAD AND I WILL ASK YOU THE 

895
00:26:15,974 --> 00:26:17,008
NEXT QUESTION BECAUSE OF THAT. 

896
00:26:17,008 --> 00:26:18,677
YOU WILL PROBABLY BE THE KILLER 

897
00:26:18,677 --> 00:26:22,480
OF ALL QUESTIONS. 

898
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:24,883
>> CAN YOU COME FORWARD WITH 

899
00:26:24,883 --> 00:26:25,216
THE EVIDENCE? 

900
00:26:25,216 --> 00:26:28,086
>> CHINA PUT OUT $250 BILLION 

901
00:26:28,086 --> 00:26:30,121
AND THEY ARE PAYING 25%, THEY 

902
00:26:30,121 --> 00:26:31,289
ARE PAYING BILLIONS AND 

903
00:26:31,289 --> 00:26:32,924
BILLIONS AND THIS HAS NEVER 

904
00:26:32,924 --> 00:26:34,359
HAPPENED TO CHINA. 

905
00:26:34,359 --> 00:26:36,528
I LIKE CHINA AND I LIKE 

906
00:26:36,528 --> 00:26:37,796
PRESIDENT  Xi A LOT. 

907
00:26:37,796 --> 00:26:39,397
I THINK HE'S A FRIEND OF MINE. 

908
00:26:39,397 --> 00:26:41,266
HE MAY NOT BE A FRIEND OF MINE 

909
00:26:41,266 --> 00:26:42,734
ANYMORE BUT I THINK YOU 

910
00:26:42,734 --> 00:26:44,903
PROBABLY RESPECTS ME, AND FROM 

911
00:26:44,903 --> 00:26:46,905
ON WHAT I HEAR, IF YOU LOOK AT 

912
00:26:46,905 --> 00:26:48,206
MR. PILLSBURY, THE LEADING 

913
00:26:48,206 --> 00:26:49,641
AUTHORITY ON CHINA AND HE WAS 

914
00:26:49,641 --> 00:26:51,443
ON A GOOD SHOW -- I WON'T 

915
00:26:51,443 --> 00:26:53,144
MENTION THE NAME OF THE SHOW -- 

916
00:26:53,144 --> 00:26:55,080
BUT HE SAID CHINA HAS TOTAL 

917
00:26:55,080 --> 00:26:56,514
RESPECT FOR DONALD TRUMP AND 

918
00:26:56,514 --> 00:26:57,882
FOR DONALD TRUMP'S VERY, VERY 

919
00:26:57,882 --> 00:27:02,787
LARGE BRAIN. 

920
00:27:02,787 --> 00:27:04,456
HE SAID DONALD TRUMP, THEY 

921
00:27:04,456 --> 00:27:06,824
DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO. 

922
00:27:06,824 --> 00:27:08,493
NEVER HAPPEN. 

923
00:27:08,493 --> 00:27:10,895
ONE THING THEY ARE TRYING TO DO 

924
00:27:10,895 --> 00:27:12,364
IS CONVINCE PEOPLE TO GO 

925
00:27:12,364 --> 00:27:13,832
AGAINST DONALD TRUMP BECAUSE A 

926
00:27:13,832 --> 00:27:15,433
NORMAL REGULAR POLITICAL PERSON 

927
00:27:15,433 --> 00:27:17,635
THAT HAS NO CONCEPT OF WHAT THE 

928
00:27:17,635 --> 00:27:19,437
HECK HE'S DOING, WOULD LET 

929
00:27:19,437 --> 00:27:20,905
CHINA CONTINUE TO TAKE $500 

930
00:27:20,905 --> 00:27:24,008
BILLION A YEAR OUT OF OUR 

931
00:27:24,008 --> 00:27:25,009
COUNTRY AND REBUILD THEIR 

932
00:27:25,009 --> 00:27:25,276
COUNTRY. 

933
00:27:25,276 --> 00:27:26,411
THEY WERE BUILDING 29 MASSIVE 

934
00:27:26,411 --> 00:27:27,879
BRIDGES LIKE THE GEORGE 

935
00:27:27,879 --> 00:27:29,848
WASHINGTON BRIDGE. 

936
00:27:29,848 --> 00:27:31,149
THEY ARE BUILDING THINGS THAT 

937
00:27:31,149 --> 00:27:32,217
WE DON'T BUILD ANYMORE. 

938
00:27:32,217 --> 00:27:33,918
WE ARE STARTING TO BUILD THEM 

939
00:27:33,918 --> 00:27:35,220
AGAIN AND OUR ECONOMY IS HOTTER 

940
00:27:35,220 --> 00:27:36,221
THAN IT'S EVER BEEN. 

941
00:27:36,221 --> 00:27:40,325
I DON'T KNOW IF YOU SAW THE 

942
00:27:40,325 --> 00:27:41,459
CONFIDENCE LEVELS THIS MORNING 

943
00:27:41,459 --> 00:27:42,460
THAT JUST CAME OUT, FANTASTIC 

944
00:27:42,460 --> 00:27:44,662
AND IN ALL FAIRNESS TO THE FED 

945
00:27:44,662 --> 00:27:45,597
RAISING RATES, THEY ARE RAISING 

946
00:27:45,597 --> 00:27:48,066
RATES BECAUSE WE'VE NEVER DONE 

947
00:27:48,066 --> 00:27:50,235
LIKE WE ARE DOING NOW AND ONE 

948
00:27:50,235 --> 00:27:52,671
OF THE THINGS IT IS NICE ABOUT 

949
00:27:52,671 --> 00:27:55,373
THE RATES, THE PEOPLE THAT WERE 

950
00:27:55,373 --> 00:27:57,308
HURT THE WORST BY THE ZERO 

951
00:27:57,308 --> 00:27:59,077
INTEREST RATES -- YOU KNOW -- 

952
00:27:59,077 --> 00:28:00,111
PRESIDENT OBAMA HAD AN ECONOMY 

953
00:28:00,111 --> 00:28:03,615
AND IT WAS THE WORST COMEBACK 

954
00:28:03,615 --> 00:28:05,183
SINCE THE GREAT DEPRESSION AND 

955
00:28:05,183 --> 00:28:07,185
YOU'VE ALL HEARD THAT BUT 

956
00:28:07,185 --> 00:28:09,487
REMEMBER, HE WAS PLAYING WITH 

957
00:28:09,487 --> 00:28:11,189
ZERO INTEREST MONEY, FUNNY 

958
00:28:11,189 --> 00:28:11,422
MONEY. 

959
00:28:11,422 --> 00:28:12,624
THAT'S EASY. 

960
00:28:12,624 --> 00:28:13,825
I'M PLAYING WITH FAIRLY 

961
00:28:13,825 --> 00:28:14,258
EXPENSIVE MONEY. 

962
00:28:14,258 --> 00:28:15,960
WHEN HE DOES THAT, THE PEOPLE 

963
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:17,695
THAT BENEFIT ARE PEOPLE THAT 

964
00:28:17,695 --> 00:28:19,698
ACTUALLY, IN THEIR WHOLE LIFE, 

965
00:28:19,698 --> 00:28:22,100
THEY WOULD SAVE 10%, 15% IN THE 

966
00:28:22,100 --> 00:28:23,168
BANK AND THOSE PEOPLE GOT 

967
00:28:23,168 --> 00:28:24,436
KILLED BECAUSE THEY PUT THEIR 

968
00:28:24,436 --> 00:28:25,670
MONEY IN THE BANK AND WERE 

969
00:28:25,670 --> 00:28:26,971
GOING TO LIVE OFF THE INTEREST 

970
00:28:26,971 --> 00:28:30,642
AND THERE WAS NO INTEREST. 

971
00:28:30,642 --> 00:28:32,577
NOW, THOSE PEOPLE ARE STARTING 

972
00:28:32,577 --> 00:28:33,878
TO GET INTEREST IN THOSE ARE 

973
00:28:33,878 --> 00:28:35,680
THE PEOPLE, FRANKLY, THAT DID A 

974
00:28:35,680 --> 00:28:36,948
GREAT JOB AND THE PEOPLE THAT 

975
00:28:36,948 --> 00:28:38,483
DID IT RIGHT, THAT DID THE BEST 

976
00:28:38,483 --> 00:28:41,419
JOB GOT HURT THE MOST. 

977
00:28:41,419 --> 00:28:42,587
BASICALLY, I'M A LOW INTEREST 

978
00:28:42,587 --> 00:28:45,023
RATE PERSON, I HATE TO TELL 

979
00:28:45,023 --> 00:28:49,027
YOU. 

980
00:28:49,027 --> 00:28:52,964
>> MR. PRESIDENT, YOU HAVE 

981
00:28:52,964 --> 00:28:54,432
ANOTHER MEETING TOMORROW WITH 

982
00:28:54,432 --> 00:28:54,899
ROD ROSENSTEIN. 

983
00:28:54,899 --> 00:28:56,134
ARE YOU PLANNING TO FIRE ROD 

984
00:28:56,134 --> 00:28:56,434
ROSENSTEIN? 

985
00:28:56,434 --> 00:28:57,301
>> I'M TALKING TO HIM. 

986
00:28:57,301 --> 00:28:59,804
WE'VE HAD A GOOD TALK AND HE 

987
00:28:59,804 --> 00:29:01,272
SAID HE NEVER SAID IT AND SAID 

988
00:29:01,272 --> 00:29:03,641
HE DOESN'T BELIEVE IT AND SAID 

989
00:29:03,641 --> 00:29:06,010
HE HAS A LOT OF RESPECT FOR ME 

990
00:29:06,010 --> 00:29:07,812
AND HE WAS VERY NICE AND WE 

991
00:29:07,812 --> 00:29:08,078
WILL SEE. 

992
00:29:08,078 --> 00:29:09,613
HE'S A MEMBER OF THE TRUMP 

993
00:29:09,613 --> 00:29:14,319
ADMINISTRATION AND THE JUSTICE 

994
00:29:14,319 --> 00:29:14,819
DEPARTMENT. I 

995
00:29:14,819 --> 00:29:16,321
WOULD CERTAINLY PREFER NOT 

996
00:29:16,321 --> 00:29:16,621
DOING THAT. 

997
00:29:16,621 --> 00:29:18,523
THERE WAS NO COLLUSION, NO 

998
00:29:18,523 --> 00:29:19,591
OBSTRUCTION UNLESS YOU CALL 

999
00:29:19,591 --> 00:29:21,960
OBSTRUCTION THE FACT THAT I 

1000
00:29:21,960 --> 00:29:22,527
FIGHT BACK. 

1001
00:29:22,527 --> 00:29:24,162
I DO FIGHT BACK. I 

1002
00:29:24,162 --> 00:29:26,030
REALLY FIGHT BACK. 

1003
00:29:26,030 --> 00:29:28,066
IF YOU CALL THAT OBSTRUCTION, 

1004
00:29:28,066 --> 00:29:29,033
THAT'S FINE BUT THERE'S NO 

1005
00:29:29,033 --> 00:29:30,235
OBSTRUCTION, NO COLLUSION AND 

1006
00:29:30,235 --> 00:29:33,004
I'M GOING TO MEET WITH HIM 

1007
00:29:33,004 --> 00:29:35,073
TOMORROW AND I MAY CALL ROD 

1008
00:29:35,073 --> 00:29:36,407
TONIGHT OR TOMORROW AND ASK FOR 

1009
00:29:36,407 --> 00:29:38,343
A LITTLE BIT OF A DELAY BECAUSE 

1010
00:29:38,343 --> 00:29:39,611
I DON'T WANT TO DO ANYTHING 

1011
00:29:39,611 --> 00:29:41,012
THAT GETS IN THE WAY OF THIS 

1012
00:29:41,012 --> 00:29:44,249
VERY IMPORTANT SUPREME COURT. 

1013
00:29:44,249 --> 00:29:50,355
I DON'T WANT TO COMPETE AND 

1014
00:29:50,355 --> 00:29:52,123
HURT THE DECISION ONE WAY OR 

1015
00:29:52,123 --> 00:29:52,556
THE OTHER. 

1016
00:29:52,556 --> 00:29:54,526
AGAIN, I WANT TO HEAR WHAT SHE 

1017
00:29:54,526 --> 00:29:55,627
HAS TO SAY. 

1018
00:29:55,627 --> 00:29:57,295
I MAY DELAY THAT. 

1019
00:29:57,295 --> 00:29:58,463
I'M GOING TO SEE. 

1020
00:29:58,463 --> 00:29:59,964
I DON'T WANT TO DO ANYTHING 

1021
00:29:59,964 --> 00:30:01,032
THAT WILL CONFLICT WITH THAT 

1022
00:30:01,032 --> 00:30:02,901
BUT MY PREFERENCE WOULD BE TO 

1023
00:30:02,901 --> 00:30:05,236
KEEP HIM. 

1024
00:30:05,236 --> 00:30:07,538
AND, TO LET HIM FINISH UP. 

1025
00:30:07,538 --> 00:30:10,008
YOU KNOW WHY CALL IT A WITCH 

1026
00:30:10,008 --> 00:30:12,343
HUNT AND IT IS A WITCH HUNT. 

1027
00:30:12,343 --> 00:30:14,045
IF YOU LOOK AT THE FBI 

1028
00:30:14,045 --> 00:30:15,046
STATEMENTS WITH PETER STRZOK 

1029
00:30:15,046 --> 00:30:16,681
AND HIS LOVER, LISA PAGE, AND 

1030
00:30:16,681 --> 00:30:19,651
IF YOU LOOK AT ALL OF THE THINGS

1031
00:30:19,651 --> 00:30:22,353
THAT HAVE GONE ON IN THE FBI 

1032
00:30:22,353 --> 00:30:24,155
AND YOU LOOK AT MCCABE TAKING 

1033
00:30:24,155 --> 00:30:25,690
$700,000 FROM A HILLARY CLINTON 

1034
00:30:25,690 --> 00:30:29,460
PACK, ESSENTIALLY RUN BY TERRY 

1035
00:30:29,460 --> 00:30:30,762
MCAULIFFE, AND HE GIVES THEM 

1036
00:30:30,762 --> 00:30:33,731
HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS

1037
00:30:33,731 --> 00:30:35,266
AND HE'S IN CHARGE OF HER 

1038
00:30:35,266 --> 00:30:36,467
CAMPAIGN AND HIS WIFE IS 

1039
00:30:36,467 --> 00:30:40,638
GETTING ALL OF THIS MONEY? TO 

1040
00:30:40,638 --> 00:30:40,905
RUN? 

1041
00:30:40,905 --> 00:30:41,171
SHE LOST. 

1042
00:30:41,171 --> 00:30:45,543
WHAT'S GOING ON? 

1043
00:30:45,543 --> 00:30:48,279
IF YOU LOOK AT THE HORRIBLE 

1044
00:30:48,279 --> 00:30:50,715
STATEMENTS LIKE WAY TO GO, PAGE,

1045
00:30:50,715 --> 00:30:52,917
GREAT STORY YOU PUT INTO A 

1046
00:30:52,917 --> 00:30:53,217
NEWSPAPER. 

1047
00:30:53,217 --> 00:30:54,619
ESSENTIALLY, NOW WE WILL GO AND 

1048
00:30:54,619 --> 00:30:55,653
INVESTIGATE THAT GROUP. 

1049
00:30:55,653 --> 00:31:00,692
IT'S TERRIBLE. 

1050
00:31:00,692 --> 00:31:03,328
WE HAVE CAUGHT PEOPLE DOING 

1051
00:31:03,328 --> 00:31:04,795
THINGS THAT ARE TERRIBLE. I 

1052
00:31:04,795 --> 00:31:06,664
WOULD MUCH PREFER KEEPING ROD 

1053
00:31:06,664 --> 00:31:07,231
ROSENSTEIN, MUCH PREFER. 

1054
00:31:07,231 --> 00:31:08,933
MANY PEOPLE SAY I HAVE THE 

1055
00:31:08,933 --> 00:31:10,334
RIGHT TO FIRE HIM. 

1056
00:31:10,334 --> 00:31:12,237
HE SAID HE DID NOT SAY IT AND 

1057
00:31:12,237 --> 00:31:13,805
HE DOES NOT BELIEVE THAT AND 

1058
00:31:13,805 --> 00:31:16,541
NOBODY IN THIS ROOM BELIEVES 

1059
00:31:16,541 --> 00:31:16,741
THAT. 

1060
00:31:16,741 --> 00:31:19,043
BY THE WAY, I DEAL WITH THESE 

1061
00:31:19,043 --> 00:31:19,276
PEOPLE. 

1062
00:31:19,276 --> 00:31:20,745
I WAS WITH MIKE POMPEO AND WE 

1063
00:31:20,745 --> 00:31:22,180
WERE DEALING AT A VERY HIGH 

1064
00:31:22,180 --> 00:31:23,915
LEVEL WITH JAPAN. 

1065
00:31:23,915 --> 00:31:25,550
NOW WE ARE SAYING THINGS THAT 

1066
00:31:25,550 --> 00:31:26,885
NOBODY IN THE ROOM EVEN 

1067
00:31:26,885 --> 00:31:28,386
UNDERSTOOD AND I SAID THEM A 

1068
00:31:28,386 --> 00:31:30,989
LONG TIME AGO AND I WAS RIGHT. 

1069
00:31:30,989 --> 00:31:33,024
HE SAID, THAT'S NOT THE 25TH 

1070
00:31:33,024 --> 00:31:35,259
AMENDMENT I'M LOOKING AT. I 

1071
00:31:35,259 --> 00:31:38,563
THINK I CAN SAY THAT FOR MIKE. 

1072
00:31:38,563 --> 00:31:39,864
>> NO ONE IN YOUR 

1073
00:31:39,864 --> 00:31:40,598
ADMINISTRATION HAS EVER 

1074
00:31:40,598 --> 00:31:42,000
DISCUSSED USING THE 25TH 

1075
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,202
AMENDMENT AGAINST YOU? 

1076
00:31:44,202 --> 00:31:44,602
>> ENEMIES, SURE. 

1077
00:31:44,602 --> 00:31:46,337
>> IN YOUR ADMINISTRATION? 

1078
00:31:46,337 --> 00:31:47,538
>> THEY USE ANYTHING THEY CAN. 

1079
00:31:47,538 --> 00:31:49,574
THEY ARE NOT IN LOVE WITH ME. 

1080
00:31:49,574 --> 00:31:51,342
THEY WON'T BEAT ME IN THE 

1081
00:31:51,342 --> 00:31:52,476
ELECTION AND THEY KNOW THAT. 

1082
00:31:52,476 --> 00:31:54,912
THEY'RE NOT GOING TO BEAT ME. 

1083
00:31:54,912 --> 00:31:57,782
THE PEOPLE I'M LOOKING AT OUR 

1084
00:31:57,782 --> 00:31:58,582
TOTAL LIGHTWEIGHTS. 

1085
00:31:58,582 --> 00:32:00,218
I DREAM OF RUNNING AGAINST 

1086
00:32:00,218 --> 00:32:01,019
THOSE PEOPLE. 

1087
00:32:01,019 --> 00:32:02,787
MAYBE I WILL COME AGAINST 

1088
00:32:02,787 --> 00:32:03,220
SOMEONE THAT'S NOT. 

1089
00:32:03,220 --> 00:32:04,722
I'M AGAINST WHAT THEY WANT TO 

1090
00:32:04,722 --> 00:32:24,175
DO AND I'M IN FAVOR OF LAW 

1091
00:32:24,175 --> 00:32:24,508
ENFORCEMENT. 

1092
00:32:24,508 --> 00:32:25,910
I'M IN FAVOR OF SAFETY AND 

1093
00:32:25,910 --> 00:32:27,879
SECURITY AND LOW TAXES. I 

1094
00:32:27,879 --> 00:32:28,713
WANT LOW TAXES. I 

1095
00:32:28,713 --> 00:32:29,046
WANT BORDERS. 

1096
00:32:29,046 --> 00:32:29,680
WE ARE GETTING ANOTHER $1.6 

1097
00:32:29,680 --> 00:32:31,182
BILLION IN BORDERS. I 

1098
00:32:31,182 --> 00:32:31,515
WANT BORDERS. 

1099
00:32:31,515 --> 00:32:32,550
WE'VE SPENT $3.2 BILLION AND WE 

1100
00:32:32,550 --> 00:32:33,584
ARE GETTING $1.6 BILLION AND 

1101
00:32:33,584 --> 00:32:34,986
THEN WE WILL COMPLETE THE WALL. 

1102
00:32:34,986 --> 00:32:35,853
THEY DON'T WANT THAT. 

1103
00:32:35,853 --> 00:32:36,821
THEY DON'T WANT THAT. 

1104
00:32:36,821 --> 00:32:38,689
THEY DON'T WANT THE THINGS THAT 

1105
00:32:38,689 --> 00:32:39,524
I HAVE. I 

1106
00:32:39,524 --> 00:32:41,559
MUST SAY I KNOW MANY OF THE 

1107
00:32:41,559 --> 00:32:42,794
DEMOCRATS WILL SAY THINGS AND 

1108
00:32:42,794 --> 00:32:43,494
THEN WINKED AT ME. 

1109
00:32:43,494 --> 00:32:44,828
AGAIN, IT'S THE SAME OLD STORY. 

1110
00:32:44,828 --> 00:32:46,531
THEY WILL SAY THINGS THAT THEY 

1111
00:32:46,531 --> 00:32:46,831
DON'T MEAN. 

1112
00:32:46,831 --> 00:32:47,198
IT'S POLITICS. 

1113
00:32:47,198 --> 00:32:48,499
THE REASON THEY DON'T WANT ME 

1114
00:32:48,499 --> 00:32:50,134
IS BECAUSE THEY WANT TO RUN THE 

1115
00:32:50,134 --> 00:32:50,468
SHOW. 

1116
00:32:50,468 --> 00:32:51,102
THEY WANT IT. 

1117
00:32:51,102 --> 00:32:52,203
IT'S POWER, WHATEVER YOU WANT 

1118
00:32:52,203 --> 00:32:53,137
TO CALL IT. 

1119
00:32:53,137 --> 00:32:54,439
WHAT THEY'VE DONE HERE IS A 

1120
00:32:54,439 --> 00:32:57,909
DISGRACE, A TOTAL DISGRACE. 

1121
00:32:57,909 --> 00:32:59,944
WHAT THEY DO IS INTERESTING. 

1122
00:32:59,944 --> 00:33:02,813
IN ONE CASE, THEY SAY HE'S A 

1123
00:33:02,813 --> 00:33:04,315
FASCIST, HE'S TAKING OVER THE 

1124
00:33:04,315 --> 00:33:06,384
GOVERNMENT, THE MOST POWERFUL 

1125
00:33:06,384 --> 00:33:07,685
PRESIDENT, EVER, A HORRIBLE 

1126
00:33:07,685 --> 00:33:09,020
HUMAN BEING AND HE WANTS TO 

1127
00:33:09,020 --> 00:33:10,955
TAKE OVER THE ENTIRE GOVERNMENT 

1128
00:33:10,955 --> 00:33:12,523
AND WE CAN'T STOP HIM. 

1129
00:33:12,523 --> 00:33:14,459
THAT DIDN'T WORK AND THE NEXT 

1130
00:33:14,459 --> 00:33:16,928
WEEK THEY SAID, HE'S 

1131
00:33:16,928 --> 00:33:17,261
INCOMPETENT. 

1132
00:33:17,261 --> 00:33:17,962
WAIT A MINUTE. 

1133
00:33:17,962 --> 00:33:20,164
IN ONE CASE I'M TAKING OVER THE 

1134
00:33:20,164 --> 00:33:22,366
WORLD AND IN THE OTHER CASE 

1135
00:33:22,366 --> 00:33:23,001
INCOMPETENT? 

1136
00:33:23,001 --> 00:33:26,404
THEY TRIED THAT FOR A WEEK AND 

1137
00:33:26,404 --> 00:33:27,939
THAT DIDN'T WORK. 

1138
00:33:27,939 --> 00:33:29,240
LOOK -- THESE ARE VERY 

1139
00:33:29,240 --> 00:33:30,374
DISHONEST PEOPLE, CON ARTISTS. 

1140
00:33:30,374 --> 00:33:34,278
AND THE PRESS KNOWS IT, BUT THE 

1141
00:33:34,278 --> 00:33:37,080
PRESS DOESN'T WRITE IT. 

1142
00:33:37,080 --> 00:33:38,683
THAT IS A LOT OF HANDS. 

1143
00:33:38,683 --> 00:33:39,550
THAT IS A LOT. 

1144
00:33:39,550 --> 00:33:40,184
STEVE, GO AHEAD. 

1145
00:33:40,184 --> 00:33:41,352
A VERY HIGH-QUALITY PERSON, 

1146
00:33:41,352 --> 00:33:41,685
THIS MAN. 

1147
00:33:41,685 --> 00:33:44,922
GIVE IT TO ME. 

1148
00:33:44,922 --> 00:33:50,061
REUTERS. 

1149
00:33:50,061 --> 00:33:52,130
>> YOU ARE GETTING LETTERS FROM 

1150
00:33:52,130 --> 00:33:53,698
CHAIRMAN KIM, WHY DO NEED A 

1151
00:33:53,698 --> 00:33:55,466
SECOND SUMMIT SO SOON? 

1152
00:33:55,466 --> 00:33:56,734
>> BECAUSE HE'D LIKE ONE. 

1153
00:33:56,734 --> 00:33:58,603
>> WHAT WOULD IT BE FOR? 

1154
00:33:58,603 --> 00:34:00,571
>> I'VE RECEIVED TWO LETTERS 

1155
00:34:00,571 --> 00:34:03,841
FROM CHAIRMAN KIM AND AT SOME 

1156
00:34:03,841 --> 00:34:05,243
POINT I WILL GIVE OUT THESE 

1157
00:34:05,243 --> 00:34:05,510
LETTERS. 

1158
00:34:05,510 --> 00:34:06,243
THEY ARE INCREDIBLE LETTERS. 

1159
00:34:06,243 --> 00:34:08,679
THEY ARE MAGNIFICENT IN THE 

1160
00:34:08,679 --> 00:34:10,481
SENSE OF HIS FEELING FOR 

1161
00:34:10,481 --> 00:34:11,983
WANTING TO GET THIS DONE. 

1162
00:34:11,983 --> 00:34:14,351
I REALLY BELIEVE HE WANTS TO 

1163
00:34:14,351 --> 00:34:15,786
GET IT DONE. I 

1164
00:34:15,786 --> 00:34:16,587
MAY BE WRONG. I 

1165
00:34:16,587 --> 00:34:18,188
HEARD SOMEBODY ON A CERTAIN 

1166
00:34:18,188 --> 00:34:19,357
NETWORK, AND I WON'T MENTION, 

1167
00:34:19,357 --> 00:34:20,424
WHY HAS PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP 

1168
00:34:20,424 --> 00:34:24,962
GIVEN SO MUCH TO NORTH KOREA? I 

1169
00:34:24,962 --> 00:34:27,165
SAID, WAIT A MINUTE. 

1170
00:34:27,165 --> 00:34:29,000
I ASKED SARAH HUCKABEE TO CALL 

1171
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:29,534
THIS PERSON. I 

1172
00:34:29,534 --> 00:34:31,436
GAVE THEM NOTHING OTHER THEN I 

1173
00:34:31,436 --> 00:34:31,803
MET THEM. 

1174
00:34:31,803 --> 00:34:33,571
WHAT DID I GIVE THEM? I 

1175
00:34:33,571 --> 00:34:36,239
DIDN'T DO WHAT OBAMA DID, GIVING

1176
00:34:36,239 --> 00:34:38,810
THEM $1.8 BILLION IN CASH TO GET

1177
00:34:38,810 --> 00:34:40,210
BACK FOUR HOSTAGES. I 

1178
00:34:40,210 --> 00:34:41,913
GOT BACK OUR HOSTAGES AND I 

1179
00:34:41,913 --> 00:34:43,347
NEVER PAID THEM 10 CENTS. 

1180
00:34:43,347 --> 00:34:45,248
HE WANTS TO MAKE A DEAL AND 

1181
00:34:45,248 --> 00:34:47,251
THAT I'D LIKE TO MAKE A DEAL. 

1182
00:34:47,251 --> 00:34:49,286
WE ACTUALLY HAVE A GOOD 

1183
00:34:49,286 --> 00:34:50,121
RELATIONSHIP, A LOT DIFFERENT 

1184
00:34:50,121 --> 00:34:52,757
THAN THE LAST TIME AT THE 

1185
00:34:52,757 --> 00:34:53,123
UNITED NATIONS. 

1186
00:34:53,123 --> 00:34:54,492
THAT WAS A LITTLE BIT ROUGH. 

1187
00:34:54,492 --> 00:34:56,494
DON'T FORGET THAT AT THAT TIME, 

1188
00:34:56,494 --> 00:34:57,728
THEY SAID TRUMP IS SAYING 

1189
00:34:57,728 --> 00:34:59,063
HORRIBLE THINGS AND WILL GET US 

1190
00:34:59,063 --> 00:34:59,930
INTO A WAR. 

1191
00:34:59,930 --> 00:35:02,633
YOU ARE GOING TO HAVE A WAR IF 

1192
00:35:02,633 --> 00:35:04,168
I WAS AN ELECTED. 

1193
00:35:04,168 --> 00:35:06,170
YOU'D BE IN A WAR AND PRESIDENT 

1194
00:35:06,170 --> 00:35:07,505
OBAMA ESSENTIALLY SAID THE SAME 

1195
00:35:07,505 --> 00:35:07,738
THING. 

1196
00:35:07,738 --> 00:35:10,575
HE WAS READY TO GO TO WAR. 

1197
00:35:10,575 --> 00:35:12,677
YOU WOULD HAVE LOST MILLIONS, 

1198
00:35:12,677 --> 00:35:14,111
NOT THOUSANDS, MILLIONS OF 

1199
00:35:14,111 --> 00:35:14,879
PEOPLE. 

1200
00:35:14,879 --> 00:35:18,015
SEOUL, KOREA, HAS 30 MILLION 

1201
00:35:18,015 --> 00:35:19,016
PEOPLE 40 MILES AND 30 MILES 

1202
00:35:19,016 --> 00:35:20,250
FROM THIS VERY DANGEROUS 

1203
00:35:20,250 --> 00:35:21,619
BORDER. 

1204
00:35:21,619 --> 00:35:22,987
IF IT WASN'T ELECTED, YOU 

1205
00:35:22,987 --> 00:35:24,288
WOULD'VE HAD A WAR. 

1206
00:35:24,288 --> 00:35:25,789
PRESIDENT OBAMA THOUGHT YOU HAD 

1207
00:35:25,789 --> 00:35:27,258
TO GET A WAR. 

1208
00:35:27,258 --> 00:35:28,793
DO YOU KNOW HOW CLOSE HE WAS 

1209
00:35:28,793 --> 00:35:29,727
TOO PRESSING THE TRIGGER? 

1210
00:35:29,727 --> 00:35:31,028
MILLIONS OF PEOPLE IN WITH ME, 

1211
00:35:31,028 --> 00:35:34,899
NOBODY IS TALKING ABOUT THAT. 

1212
00:35:34,899 --> 00:35:37,301
WE HAVE A VERY GOOD 

1213
00:35:37,301 --> 00:35:37,634
RELATIONSHIP. 

1214
00:35:37,634 --> 00:35:38,903
HE LIKES ME, I LIKE HIM AND WE 

1215
00:35:38,903 --> 00:35:39,236
GET ALONG. 

1216
00:35:39,236 --> 00:35:41,138
HE WROTE ME TWO OF THE MOST 

1217
00:35:41,138 --> 00:35:44,875
BEAUTIFUL LETTERS. 

1218
00:35:44,875 --> 00:35:46,978
WHEN I SHOWED ONE OF THE 

1219
00:35:46,978 --> 00:35:48,546
LETTERS, JUST ONE, TO PRIME 

1220
00:35:48,546 --> 00:35:49,446
MINISTER SHINZO ABE, HE SAID 

1221
00:35:49,446 --> 00:35:54,418
THIS IS ACTUALLY A 

1222
00:35:54,418 --> 00:35:55,419
GROUNDBREAKING LETTER, AND 

1223
00:35:55,419 --> 00:35:57,020
INCREDIBLE AND HISTORIC LETTER. 

1224
00:35:57,020 --> 00:35:58,222
IT IS HISTORIC. 

1225
00:35:58,222 --> 00:35:59,457
IT'S A BEAUTIFUL PIECE OF ART. I

1226
00:35:59,457 --> 00:36:01,158
THINK WE'RE GOING TO MAKE A 

1227
00:36:01,158 --> 00:36:01,358
DEAL. 

1228
00:36:01,358 --> 00:36:04,162
WILL WE MAKE A DEAL, STEVE? I 

1229
00:36:04,162 --> 00:36:04,929
DON'T REALLY KNOW. I 

1230
00:36:04,929 --> 00:36:07,765
THINK WE ARE GOING TO AND IN THE

1231
00:36:07,765 --> 00:36:11,269
MEANTIME, I DON'T WANT TO BORE 

1232
00:36:11,269 --> 00:36:12,970
YOU, NO ROCKETS, NO MISSILES, 

1233
00:36:12,970 --> 00:36:14,405
NO NUCLEAR TESTS. 

1234
00:36:14,405 --> 00:36:16,274
FOR OVER A YEAR WHERE YOU 

1235
00:36:16,274 --> 00:36:16,707
HAVEN'T SEEN THAT. 

1236
00:36:16,707 --> 00:36:19,210
BEFORE I GOT HERE, EVERYBODY IN 

1237
00:36:19,210 --> 00:36:20,778
THIS ROOM THOUGHT YOU WERE 

1238
00:36:20,778 --> 00:36:23,314
GOING TO WAR. 

1239
00:36:23,314 --> 00:36:24,381
WHAT HAPPENED, IT WAS FUNNY. 

1240
00:36:24,381 --> 00:36:25,583
THEY SAID, HE WAS TERRIBLE, SO 

1241
00:36:25,583 --> 00:36:27,818
ROUGH WITH CHAIRMAN KIM, KIM 

1242
00:36:27,818 --> 00:36:28,920
JONG-UN. 

1243
00:36:28,920 --> 00:36:33,524
SO ROUGH. 

1244
00:36:33,524 --> 00:36:36,928
WELL, I HAD A GREAT MEETING 

1245
00:36:36,928 --> 00:36:38,062
WITH PRESIDENT PUTIN AND ON 

1246
00:36:38,062 --> 00:36:40,631
THAT WHEN THEY SAID, HE WAS TOO 

1247
00:36:40,631 --> 00:36:42,733
SOFT WITH PRESIDENT PUTIN. I 

1248
00:36:42,733 --> 00:36:45,036
HAD A GREAT MEETING WITH PUTIN. 

1249
00:36:45,036 --> 00:36:46,069
IT LASTED FOR TWO HOURS. 

1250
00:36:46,069 --> 00:36:49,440
WE DISCUSSED EVERYTHING, 

1251
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:50,975
UKRAINE, SERIAL, -- SYRIA, WE 

1252
00:36:50,975 --> 00:36:52,109
HAD A GREAT MEETING. 

1253
00:36:52,109 --> 00:36:54,512
THEY WANTED ME TO END UP IN A 

1254
00:36:54,512 --> 00:36:56,314
BOXING MATCH AND IF I WAS 

1255
00:36:56,314 --> 00:36:57,748
KILLER TOUGH WITH PUTIN HE 

1256
00:36:57,748 --> 00:36:59,817
WOULD HAVE SAID I WAS TOO 

1257
00:36:59,817 --> 00:37:00,050
TOUGH. 

1258
00:37:00,050 --> 00:37:01,185
YOU CAN'T WIN WITH THESE PEOPLE 

1259
00:37:01,185 --> 00:37:02,787
BUT YOU JUST KEEP GOING AND IN 

1260
00:37:02,787 --> 00:37:05,623
THE MEANTIME, WE ARE DOING 

1261
00:37:05,623 --> 00:37:05,823
WELL. 

1262
00:37:05,823 --> 00:37:06,090
GO AHEAD. 

1263
00:37:06,090 --> 00:37:08,559
>> HOW LONG SHOULD IT TAKE 

1264
00:37:08,559 --> 00:37:09,560
NORTH KOREA TO DENUCLEARIZE? 

1265
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:11,329
>> I DON'T WANT TO GET INTO THE 

1266
00:37:11,329 --> 00:37:11,529
TIME. 

1267
00:37:11,529 --> 00:37:12,596
DO YOU KNOW WHY? 

1268
00:37:12,596 --> 00:37:16,066
I SAID MIKE POMPEO, DON'T GET 

1269
00:37:16,066 --> 00:37:16,967
INTO THE TIME GAME. 

1270
00:37:16,967 --> 00:37:20,638
WE STOP THEM AND THEY ARE 

1271
00:37:20,638 --> 00:37:22,973
TAKING DOWN PLANTS AND A LOT OF 

1272
00:37:22,973 --> 00:37:23,741
DIFFERENT TESTING AREAS AND 

1273
00:37:23,741 --> 00:37:25,409
THEY ARE GOING TO TAKE DOWN 

1274
00:37:25,409 --> 00:37:26,944
MORE AND YOU WILL HEAR ABOUT 

1275
00:37:26,944 --> 00:37:27,612
THAT SOON. 

1276
00:37:27,612 --> 00:37:30,481
I DON'T WANT TO GO AHEAD OF 

1277
00:37:30,481 --> 00:37:32,249
MYSELF BUT YOU WILL HEAR ABOUT 

1278
00:37:32,249 --> 00:37:32,516
IT SOON. 

1279
00:37:32,516 --> 00:37:33,984
THEY HAVE NO INTEREST RIGHT NOW 

1280
00:37:33,984 --> 00:37:34,818
IN TESTING NUCLEAR WEAPONS. 

1281
00:37:34,818 --> 00:37:36,887
WE HAD A CASE WHEN I WAS COMING 

1282
00:37:36,887 --> 00:37:37,989
INTO OFFICE THAT YOU REMEMBER 

1283
00:37:37,989 --> 00:37:39,423
WHERE THERE WAS A MASSIVE THING 

1284
00:37:39,423 --> 00:37:40,925
THAT THEY THOUGHT WAS AN 

1285
00:37:40,925 --> 00:37:44,395
EARTHQUAKE. A MOUNTAIN MOVED 

1286
00:37:44,395 --> 00:37:50,601
OVER 1.5 INCHES. 

1287
00:37:50,601 --> 00:37:51,602
NORTH KOREA'S BEAUTIFUL LAND 

1288
00:37:51,602 --> 00:37:53,104
AND THIS MOUNTAIN ACTUALLY 

1289
00:37:53,104 --> 00:37:53,371
SHIFTED. 

1290
00:37:53,371 --> 00:37:55,072
IT SHIFTED AND SOMEBODY THOUGHT 

1291
00:37:55,072 --> 00:37:58,075
IT WAS AN EARTHQUAKE AND THEN 

1292
00:37:58,075 --> 00:37:59,810
THEY FOUND OUT IT WAS NUCLEAR 

1293
00:37:59,810 --> 00:38:00,277
TESTING. 

1294
00:38:00,277 --> 00:38:00,710
SHIFTED A MOUNTAIN. 

1295
00:38:00,710 --> 00:38:02,346
SERIOUS STUFF, SERIOUS SIZE. 

1296
00:38:02,346 --> 00:38:05,850
WHEN I CAME IN AND BEFORE I 

1297
00:38:05,850 --> 00:38:07,284
CAME, AND EVEN AT THE BEGINNING 

1298
00:38:07,284 --> 00:38:09,286
OF MINE BECAUSE I WAS HAVING 

1299
00:38:09,286 --> 00:38:15,126
RHETORICAL CONTESTS, REALLY, 

1300
00:38:15,126 --> 00:38:16,894
WITH CHAIRMAN KIM AND WE BOTH 

1301
00:38:16,894 --> 00:38:19,830
SMILE NOW AND LAUGH AT NOW, BUT 

1302
00:38:19,830 --> 00:38:21,465
EVERYBODY THOUGHT THAT WAS A 

1303
00:38:21,465 --> 00:38:21,932
HORRIBLE THING. 

1304
00:38:21,932 --> 00:38:23,234
WE'VE HAD MANY PRESIDENTS THAT 

1305
00:38:23,234 --> 00:38:24,602
WERE UNABLE TO DO ANYTHING, 

1306
00:38:24,602 --> 00:38:25,969
ANYTHING AT ALL WITH NORTH 

1307
00:38:25,969 --> 00:38:26,203
KOREA. 

1308
00:38:26,203 --> 00:38:27,438
WE NOW HAVE A GOOD 

1309
00:38:27,438 --> 00:38:28,839
RELATIONSHIP. 

1310
00:38:28,839 --> 00:38:32,710
WE HAVE A GOOD RELATIONSHIP AND 

1311
00:38:32,710 --> 00:38:36,380
MOST IMPORTANTLY, ALL OF THE 

1312
00:38:36,380 --> 00:38:37,848
THINGS THAT YOU'VE BEEN HEARING 

1313
00:38:37,848 --> 00:38:40,217
ABOUT THE HORROR STORIES, IN MY 

1314
00:38:40,217 --> 00:38:41,285
OPINION, THEY ARE GONE. 

1315
00:38:41,285 --> 00:38:44,455
COULD THEY START UP AGAIN, I 

1316
00:38:44,455 --> 00:38:44,922
GUESS. 

1317
00:38:44,922 --> 00:38:46,524
I'M A DEAL GUY. 

1318
00:38:46,524 --> 00:38:46,824
COULD THEY? 

1319
00:38:46,824 --> 00:38:47,024
YEAH. 

1320
00:38:47,024 --> 00:38:49,026
WE COULD WORK IT OUT. 

1321
00:38:49,026 --> 00:38:52,029
RIGHT HERE, I THINK THAT WHAT 

1322
00:38:52,029 --> 00:38:52,997
WE'VE DONE BEHIND THE SCENES 

1323
00:38:52,997 --> 00:38:56,233
THAT NOBODY REALLY KNOWS AND I 

1324
00:38:56,233 --> 00:38:57,368
DON'T BLAME YOU FOR NOT 

1325
00:38:57,368 --> 00:38:58,436
KNOWING, PERSONAL LETTERS AND 

1326
00:38:58,436 --> 00:38:59,270
PRIVATE LETTERS, BUT SAYING 

1327
00:38:59,270 --> 00:39:01,672
THEY WANT TO GET IT DONE. 

1328
00:39:01,672 --> 00:39:03,274
WE KNOW MUCH MORE THAN THE 

1329
00:39:03,274 --> 00:39:07,244
MEDIA, FOR CHANGE, MUCH MORE. 

1330
00:39:07,244 --> 00:39:09,213
IF YOU SO WHAT'S GOING ON 

1331
00:39:09,213 --> 00:39:11,615
BEHIND THE SCENES I THINK YOU 

1332
00:39:11,615 --> 00:39:12,650
WOULD BE VERY IMPRESSED. 

1333
00:39:12,650 --> 00:39:14,418
WE WERE A COUNTRY GOING TO WAR 

1334
00:39:14,418 --> 00:39:17,021
AND I REALLY BELIEVE PRESIDENT 

1335
00:39:17,021 --> 00:39:18,622
OBAMA WOULD. 

1336
00:39:18,622 --> 00:39:20,224
HE SAID IT WAS HIS BIGGEST 

1337
00:39:20,224 --> 00:39:22,193
PROBLEM AND WHEN I SAT WITH HIM 

1338
00:39:22,193 --> 00:39:23,427
PRIOR BEFORE GOING INTO OFFICE, 

1339
00:39:23,427 --> 00:39:25,029
HE SAID TO ME, THAT'S BY FAR 

1340
00:39:25,029 --> 00:39:27,565
THE BIGGEST PROBLEM AND HE SAID 

1341
00:39:27,565 --> 00:39:33,003
HE WAS VERY CLOSE TO GOING INTO 

1342
00:39:33,003 --> 00:39:36,373
WAR. 

1343
00:39:36,373 --> 00:39:37,808
AND, MILLIONS OF PEOPLE -- THEY 

1344
00:39:37,808 --> 00:39:39,109
SAY THOUSANDS -- NOT THOUSANDS. 

1345
00:39:39,109 --> 00:39:39,944
MILLIONS OF PEOPLE WOULD HAVE 

1346
00:39:39,944 --> 00:39:44,348
BEEN KILLED AND THAT WOULD BE 

1347
00:39:44,348 --> 00:39:46,050
RIGHT NEXT TO CHINA AND IT 

1348
00:39:46,050 --> 00:39:47,585
COULD HAVE BEEN A WORLD WAR 

1349
00:39:47,585 --> 00:39:48,385
VERY EASILY. 

1350
00:39:48,385 --> 00:39:51,722
RIGHT NOW, WE ARE IN A GREAT 

1351
00:39:51,722 --> 00:39:53,090
POSITION AND I DON'T WANT TO 

1352
00:39:53,090 --> 00:39:55,092
PLAY THE TIME GAME. I 

1353
00:39:55,092 --> 00:39:56,427
TOLD MIKE POMPEO, DON'T LET 

1354
00:39:56,427 --> 00:39:58,062
THEM DO THAT TO YOU. I 

1355
00:39:58,062 --> 00:39:59,430
HAVEN'T GIVEN ANYTHING AND WE 

1356
00:39:59,430 --> 00:40:01,765
GOT BACK A FEW WEEKS AGO, WE 

1357
00:40:01,765 --> 00:40:04,602
WERE BACK 2.5 MONTHS FROM THE 

1358
00:40:04,602 --> 00:40:06,704
SUMMIT, WHICH WAS A GREAT 

1359
00:40:06,704 --> 00:40:07,805
SUCCESS AND PEOPLE ARE 

1360
00:40:07,805 --> 00:40:09,740
SCREAMING, WHAT'S TAKING SO 

1361
00:40:09,740 --> 00:40:10,441
LONG? I 

1362
00:40:10,441 --> 00:40:12,409
SAID, YOU HAVE TO UNDERSTAND 

1363
00:40:12,409 --> 00:40:13,377
THE MEDIA. 

1364
00:40:13,377 --> 00:40:14,879
I'VE BEEN DEALING WITH THE 

1365
00:40:14,879 --> 00:40:16,146
MEDIA ALL MY LIFE, TOO MUCH. 

1366
00:40:16,146 --> 00:40:18,182
THEY WERE SCREAMING AND I SAW 

1367
00:40:18,182 --> 00:40:22,953
THAT AND OUR GUYS WERE WORKING 

1368
00:40:22,953 --> 00:40:24,989
AND I SAID, I'VE GOT ALL THE 

1369
00:40:24,989 --> 00:40:26,156
TIME IN THE WORLD. 

1370
00:40:26,156 --> 00:40:29,293
I DON'T HAVE TO RUSH IT. 

1371
00:40:29,293 --> 00:40:31,362
THERE'S NO CESSATION OF 

1372
00:40:31,362 --> 00:40:31,662
SANCTIONS. 

1373
00:40:31,662 --> 00:40:33,597
WE'VE GOT THE SECTIONS ON. 

1374
00:40:33,597 --> 00:40:35,833
I DIDN'T TAKE SANCTIONS OFF. I 

1375
00:40:35,833 --> 00:40:37,935
DID SEE A REPORTER THAT I LIKE 

1376
00:40:37,935 --> 00:40:41,005
A LOT AND HE ASKED A QUESTION 

1377
00:40:41,005 --> 00:40:43,173
TO PRESIDENT MOON OF SOUTH 

1378
00:40:43,173 --> 00:40:43,406
KOREA. 

1379
00:40:43,406 --> 00:40:46,243
HE SAID, WHY DID THE PRESIDENT 

1380
00:40:46,243 --> 00:40:47,445
GIVES SO MUCH? I 

1381
00:40:47,445 --> 00:40:48,479
DIDN'T GIVE ANYTHING. 

1382
00:40:48,479 --> 00:40:49,379
I GAVE NOTHING. 

1383
00:40:49,379 --> 00:40:52,283
WHAT HAVE I GIVEN OTHER THAN 

1384
00:40:52,283 --> 00:40:52,483
TIME? 

1385
00:40:52,483 --> 00:40:53,717
YES, I FLEW TO SINGAPORE AND WE 

1386
00:40:53,717 --> 00:40:57,388
HAD A MEETING. 

1387
00:40:57,388 --> 00:40:59,890
NOW, I DIDN'T WANT TO -- IF YOU 

1388
00:40:59,890 --> 00:41:01,992
ASK GENERAL MATTA'S 4-YEAR AND 

1389
00:41:01,992 --> 00:41:05,029
A HALF I SAID WHY DON'T WE STOP 

1390
00:41:05,029 --> 00:41:06,797
THESE RIDICULOUS, AND MY 

1391
00:41:06,797 --> 00:41:08,866
OPINION, THE MILITARY GAMES. I 

1392
00:41:08,866 --> 00:41:10,501
CALL THEM THE MILITARY GAMES. 

1393
00:41:10,501 --> 00:41:13,103
IF I TOLD YOU HOW MUCH THOSE 

1394
00:41:13,103 --> 00:41:15,205
GAMES BECAUSE -- AND FRANKLY I 

1395
00:41:15,205 --> 00:41:16,407
TOLD SOUTH KOREA HE SHOULD BE 

1396
00:41:16,407 --> 00:41:18,041
PAYING FOR THESE GAMES. 

1397
00:41:18,041 --> 00:41:20,177
THEY SAY, WE FLY THE AIRPLANES 

1398
00:41:20,177 --> 00:41:21,679
AND FROM A SHORT DISTANCE AWAY 

1399
00:41:21,679 --> 00:41:27,551
AND IT WAS FROM deGROM -- IT 

1400
00:41:27,551 --> 00:41:27,918
WAS FROM GUAM. 

1401
00:41:27,918 --> 00:41:29,286
WE FLY THESE MASSIVE BOMBERS 

1402
00:41:29,286 --> 00:41:31,188
AND I WANTED TO STOP THIS A 

1403
00:41:31,188 --> 00:41:33,791
LONG TIME. 

1404
00:41:33,791 --> 00:41:35,693
BY THE WAY, WE ARE SAVING A 

1405
00:41:35,693 --> 00:41:36,894
FORTUNE FOR THE TAXPAYERS AND 

1406
00:41:36,894 --> 00:41:39,697
IF WE NEED THEM WE CAN SET THEM 

1407
00:41:39,697 --> 00:41:40,497
UP IMMEDIATELY. 

1408
00:41:40,497 --> 00:41:42,499
IF I THINK WE NEED THEM, I WILL 

1409
00:41:42,499 --> 00:41:44,068
START THEM BEFORE THE GENERALS 

1410
00:41:44,068 --> 00:41:44,602
WILL START THEM. 

1411
00:41:44,602 --> 00:41:47,237
THE FACT THAT THIS REPORTER SAID

1412
00:41:47,237 --> 00:41:50,207
THAT, I SAID, WHAT HAVE I DONE, 

1413
00:41:50,207 --> 00:41:51,575
I HAVEN'T GIVEN ANYTHING. 

1414
00:41:51,575 --> 00:41:53,010
WE ARE ON TO THE CUSP. 

1415
00:41:53,010 --> 00:41:54,712
WE ARE GOING TO DO SOMETHING 

1416
00:41:54,712 --> 00:41:56,080
VERY IMPORTANT BUT WE ARE NOT 

1417
00:41:56,080 --> 00:41:57,648
PLAYING THE TIME GAME. 

1418
00:41:57,648 --> 00:42:00,217
IF IT TAKES TWO YEARS, THREE 

1419
00:42:00,217 --> 00:42:02,887
YEARS OR FIVE MONTHS, IT 

1420
00:42:02,887 --> 00:42:03,287
DOESN'T MATTER. 

1421
00:42:03,287 --> 00:42:05,923
THERE IS NO NUCLEAR TESTING AND 

1422
00:42:05,923 --> 00:42:07,624
THERE'S NO TESTING OF ROCKETS. 

1423
00:42:07,624 --> 00:42:11,295
GO AHEAD, PLEASE. 

1424
00:42:11,295 --> 00:42:13,030
>> THIS IS THE ONE THAT WAS 

1425
00:42:13,030 --> 00:42:14,298
NODDING WITH EVERY NICE THING. 

1426
00:42:14,298 --> 00:42:14,765
WATCH THIS QUESTION. 

1427
00:42:14,765 --> 00:42:18,202
>> IT'S A HABIT OF MINE. 

1428
00:42:18,202 --> 00:42:18,769
I'M FROM SKY NEWS. 

1429
00:42:18,769 --> 00:42:21,005
>> CONGRATULATIONS ON THE 

1430
00:42:21,005 --> 00:42:24,642
PURCHASE. 

1431
00:42:24,642 --> 00:42:26,377
>> NOTHING TO DO WITH ME. 

1432
00:42:26,377 --> 00:42:27,511
>> I HOPE YOU BENEFITED. 

1433
00:42:27,511 --> 00:42:28,445
GO AHEAD. 

1434
00:42:28,445 --> 00:42:30,147
>> ARE YOU AT ALL CONCERNED AT 

1435
00:42:30,147 --> 00:42:36,887
THE MESSAGE THAT IS BEING SENT 

1436
00:42:36,887 --> 00:42:39,923
TO THE WOMEN WHO ARE WATCHING 

1437
00:42:39,923 --> 00:42:41,892
THIS, WHEN YOU USE LANGUAGE 

1438
00:42:41,892 --> 00:42:43,494
LIKE CON JOB IN RELATION TO 

1439
00:42:43,494 --> 00:42:43,827
ALLEGATIONS. 

1440
00:42:43,827 --> 00:42:45,496
>> I'VE USED MUCH WORSE 

1441
00:42:45,496 --> 00:42:46,296
LANGUAGE THAN CON JOB. 

1442
00:42:46,296 --> 00:42:49,299
IT'S PROBABLY THE NICEST PHRASE 

1443
00:42:49,299 --> 00:42:50,033
OF USE. 

1444
00:42:50,033 --> 00:42:50,266
IT IS. 

1445
00:42:50,266 --> 00:42:51,669
IT IS A CON JOB. 

1446
00:42:51,669 --> 00:42:52,703
NO CONFIDENCE. 

1447
00:42:52,703 --> 00:42:55,572
IT IS A CON JOB BY THE 

1448
00:42:55,572 --> 00:42:56,907
DEMOCRATS AND THEY KNOW IT. 

1449
00:42:56,907 --> 00:42:59,143
>> WHAT ABOUT THE MESSAGE -- >> 

1450
00:42:59,143 --> 00:43:00,944
THEY DID THE SAME THING WITH 

1451
00:43:00,944 --> 00:43:01,879
THE RUSSIA INVESTIGATION. 

1452
00:43:01,879 --> 00:43:04,014
THEY TRIED TO CONVINCE PEOPLE 

1453
00:43:04,014 --> 00:43:06,350
THAT I HAD SOMETHING TO DO WITH 

1454
00:43:06,350 --> 00:43:06,583
RUSSIA. 

1455
00:43:06,583 --> 00:43:07,785
THERE WAS NO COLLUSION. 

1456
00:43:07,785 --> 00:43:09,253
THINK OF IT. 

1457
00:43:09,253 --> 00:43:11,589
I'M IN WISCONSIN, MICHIGAN AND 

1458
00:43:11,589 --> 00:43:13,390
I SAY, WE ARE NOT DOING WELL. 

1459
00:43:13,390 --> 00:43:14,892
I WON BOTH THOSE STATES AND WE 

1460
00:43:14,892 --> 00:43:18,495
ARE NOT DOING WELL. 

1461
00:43:18,495 --> 00:43:20,097
LET ME CALL THE RUSSIANS TO 

1462
00:43:20,097 --> 00:43:20,297
HELP. 

1463
00:43:20,297 --> 00:43:20,964
DOES ANYBODY REALLY BELIEVE 

1464
00:43:20,964 --> 00:43:21,164
THAT? 

1465
00:43:21,164 --> 00:43:22,900
IT'S A CON JOB. I 

1466
00:43:22,900 --> 00:43:27,471
WATCHED THESE GUYS AND THERE 

1467
00:43:27,471 --> 00:43:29,707
WAS A CALL FROM A RUSSIAN WHO 

1468
00:43:29,707 --> 00:43:32,443
TURNED OUT TO BE A FAKER, A 

1469
00:43:32,443 --> 00:43:34,211
COMEDIAN OR SOMETHING. 

1470
00:43:34,211 --> 00:43:34,744
THIS IS SO-AND-SO. 

1471
00:43:34,744 --> 00:43:37,047
WHY DID HE TAKE A CALL FROM A 

1472
00:43:37,047 --> 00:43:37,314
RUSSIAN? 

1473
00:43:37,314 --> 00:43:39,650
SENATOR WARNER TOOK A CALL FROM 

1474
00:43:39,650 --> 00:43:39,950
A RUSSIAN? 

1475
00:43:39,950 --> 00:43:41,785
HE WAS A COMEDIAN OR SOMETHING 

1476
00:43:41,785 --> 00:43:44,788
BUT HE SAID WE HAVE PICTURES OF 

1477
00:43:44,788 --> 00:43:45,188
PRESIDENT TRUMP. 

1478
00:43:45,188 --> 00:43:47,157
WHERE CAN I GET THEM? 

1479
00:43:47,157 --> 00:43:49,860
IF WE EVER DID THAT IT WOULD BE 

1480
00:43:49,860 --> 00:43:50,260
A BIG DEAL. 

1481
00:43:50,260 --> 00:43:52,496
IT'S A CON JOB AND NOT A BAD 

1482
00:43:52,496 --> 00:43:54,832
TERM, NOT A BAD TERM AT ALL. I 

1483
00:43:54,832 --> 00:43:57,034
TELL YOU ONE THING I CAN SAY. 

1484
00:43:57,034 --> 00:43:59,770
I'VE HAD A LOT OF PEOPLE 

1485
00:43:59,770 --> 00:44:01,372
TALKING ABOUT THIS TO ME WITH 

1486
00:44:01,372 --> 00:44:02,973
RESPECT TO WHAT'S HAPPENING 

1487
00:44:02,973 --> 00:44:05,008
BECAUSE IT'S A HORRIBLE 

1488
00:44:05,008 --> 00:44:05,542
PRECEDENT. 

1489
00:44:05,542 --> 00:44:07,578
I'M GOING TO HAVE TO GET OTHER 

1490
00:44:07,578 --> 00:44:10,981
JUDGES AND OTHER SUPREME COURT 

1491
00:44:10,981 --> 00:44:11,515
JUDGES, POSSIBLY. 

1492
00:44:11,515 --> 00:44:14,151
I COULD HAVE A LOT OF SUPREME 

1493
00:44:14,151 --> 00:44:15,819
COURT JUDGES, MORE THAN TWO AND 

1494
00:44:15,819 --> 00:44:17,154
WHEN I CALLED UP BRETT 

1495
00:44:17,154 --> 00:44:18,622
KAVANAUGH AND SPOKE TO HIM AND 

1496
00:44:18,622 --> 00:44:20,924
HIS FAMILY AND TOLD THEM THAT I 

1497
00:44:20,924 --> 00:44:23,327
CHOSE THEM, THEY WERE SO HAPPY 

1498
00:44:23,327 --> 00:44:30,234
AND SO HONORED. úIT WAS AS THOU 

1499
00:44:30,234 --> 00:44:31,568
BIGGEST THING THAT EVER 

1500
00:44:31,568 --> 00:44:32,603
HAPPENED AND I UNDERSTAND THAT, 

1501
00:44:32,603 --> 00:44:34,238
U.S. SUPREME COURT. I 

1502
00:44:34,238 --> 00:44:35,873
DON'T WANT TO BE IN A POSITION 

1503
00:44:35,873 --> 00:44:37,674
WHERE PEOPLE SAY, NO THANKS, NO 

1504
00:44:37,674 --> 00:44:37,907
THANKS. 

1505
00:44:37,907 --> 00:44:40,010
I SPOKE TO SOMEBODY 38 YEARS AGO

1506
00:44:40,010 --> 00:44:46,784
AND IT MAY NOT BE GOOD. 

1507
00:44:46,784 --> 00:44:48,652
WE HAVE A COUNTRY TO RUN. 

1508
00:44:48,652 --> 00:44:51,488
WE WANT THE BEST TALENT IN THE 

1509
00:44:51,488 --> 00:44:52,055
WORLD. 

1510
00:44:52,055 --> 00:44:55,192
BUT I TELL YOU THIS, THE PEOPLE 

1511
00:44:55,192 --> 00:44:56,660
THAT HAVE COMPLAINED TO ME 

1512
00:44:56,660 --> 00:44:57,827
ABOUT IT THE MOST ABOUT WHAT'S 

1513
00:44:57,827 --> 00:44:59,329
HAPPENING ARE WOMEN. 

1514
00:44:59,329 --> 00:45:04,201
WOMEN ARE VERY ANGRY. 

1515
00:45:04,201 --> 00:45:06,036
I'VE GOT 52% WITH WOMEN AND 

1516
00:45:06,036 --> 00:45:07,204
EVERYONE SAID THIS COULDN'T 

1517
00:45:07,204 --> 00:45:07,437
HAPPEN. 

1518
00:45:07,437 --> 00:45:07,637
52%. 

1519
00:45:07,637 --> 00:45:08,772
WOMEN ARE SO ANGRY. 

1520
00:45:08,772 --> 00:45:17,013
FRANKLY, I THINK THAT THEY LIKE 

1521
00:45:17,013 --> 00:45:18,281
WHAT THE REPUBLICANS ARE DOING. 

1522
00:45:18,281 --> 00:45:20,584
I THINK THEY WOULD HAVE LIKED 

1523
00:45:20,584 --> 00:45:22,018
TO SEE IT GO A LOT FASTER. 

1524
00:45:22,018 --> 00:45:23,687
GIVE THEM THEIR DAY IN COURT 

1525
00:45:23,687 --> 00:45:25,155
AND LET HER HAVE HER DAY IN 

1526
00:45:25,155 --> 00:45:26,490
COURT AND LET SOMEBODY ELSE 

1527
00:45:26,490 --> 00:45:28,926
HAVE A DAY IN COURT. 

1528
00:45:28,926 --> 00:45:33,363
BUT I HAVE MEN THAT DON'T LIKE 

1529
00:45:33,363 --> 00:45:33,730
IT. 

1530
00:45:33,730 --> 00:45:35,332
I HAVE WOMEN THAT ARE INCENSED 

1531
00:45:35,332 --> 00:45:36,934
AT WHAT'S GOING ON. 

1532
00:45:36,934 --> 00:45:39,069
I'VE ALWAYS SAID WOMEN ARE 

1533
00:45:39,069 --> 00:45:40,003
SMARTER THAN MEN. 

1534
00:45:40,003 --> 00:45:42,306
I'VE SAID THAT A LOT AND I MEAN 

1535
00:45:42,306 --> 00:45:42,472
IT. 

1536
00:45:42,472 --> 00:45:44,908
WOMEN ARE INCENSED AT WHAT IS 

1537
00:45:44,908 --> 00:45:49,012
GOING ON. 

1538
00:45:49,012 --> 00:45:51,315
>> WHO ARE YOU AND WHERE ARE 

1539
00:45:51,315 --> 00:45:54,351
YOU FROM? 

1540
00:45:54,351 --> 00:45:55,552
YEAH, YOU. 

1541
00:45:55,552 --> 00:45:58,054
GUY LOOKS LIKE HE'S SHOCKED. 

1542
00:45:58,054 --> 00:46:00,891
THIS IS GOING TO BE NOT GOOD. 

1543
00:46:00,891 --> 00:46:03,093
THE GUY LOOKS TOTALLY STUNNED. 

1544
00:46:03,093 --> 00:46:04,327
HAVE YOU EVER BEEN PICKED 

1545
00:46:04,327 --> 00:46:05,028
BEFORE FOR QUESTION? 

1546
00:46:05,028 --> 00:46:08,532
>> YES, SIR. 

1547
00:46:08,532 --> 00:46:10,334
>> GO AHEAD. 

1548
00:46:10,334 --> 00:46:12,135
>> I WANT TO ASK YOU, YOU 

1549
00:46:12,135 --> 00:46:15,973
ALWAYS TALK ABOUT -- YOU SAID 

1550
00:46:15,973 --> 00:46:17,040
FROM WHERE? 

1551
00:46:17,040 --> 00:46:20,110
>> FROM NORTH OF IRAQ. 

1552
00:46:20,110 --> 00:46:20,443
I'M KURDISH. 

1553
00:46:20,443 --> 00:46:20,710
>> GOOD. 

1554
00:46:20,710 --> 00:46:22,278
GREAT PEOPLE. 

1555
00:46:22,278 --> 00:46:23,180
>> THANK YOU, SIR. 

1556
00:46:23,180 --> 00:46:24,047
>> GREAT PEOPLE. 

1557
00:46:24,047 --> 00:46:24,681
THANK YOU.

GREAT PEOPLE, GREAT FIGHTERS. I 

1560
00:46:28,618 --> 00:46:32,823
LIKE THEM A LOT. 

1561
00:46:32,823 --> 00:46:33,090
LET'S GO. 

1562
00:46:33,090 --> 00:46:36,126
I LIKE THIS QUESTION SO FAR. 

1563
00:46:36,126 --> 00:46:39,363
>> YOU ALWAYS SAY YOU SUPPORT 

1564
00:46:39,363 --> 00:46:40,798
YOUR ALLIES BUT KURDISH PEOPLE 

1565
00:46:40,798 --> 00:46:42,232
ARE UNDER PRESSURE IN SYRIA AND 

1566
00:46:42,232 --> 00:46:43,133
IRAQ BY MANY ADVERSARIES. 

1567
00:46:43,133 --> 00:46:43,500
>> IT'S TRUE. 

1568
00:46:43,500 --> 00:46:44,835
>> WHAT WILL YOU DO TO ELEVATE 

1569
00:46:44,835 --> 00:46:49,072
THE POSITION TO SUPPORT THEM IF 

1570
00:46:49,072 --> 00:46:50,773
THEY HELP THE U.S. TO DEFEAT 

1571
00:46:50,773 --> 00:46:50,974
ISIS. 

1572
00:46:50,974 --> 00:46:53,677
>> WE ARE HELPING THEM A LOT 

1573
00:46:53,677 --> 00:46:55,312
AND WE'VE BEEN VERY FRIENDLY. 

1574
00:46:55,312 --> 00:46:57,581
AS YOU KNOW, WE'VE FOUGHT SIDE-

1575
00:46:57,581 --> 00:46:58,215
BY-SIDE AND WE HAVE DEFEATED 

1576
00:46:58,215 --> 00:46:59,182
ISIS, ESSENTIALLY, SHORT WHILE 

1577
00:46:59,182 --> 00:47:02,953
AGO IN THE MIDDLE EAST AND WE 

1578
00:47:02,953 --> 00:47:05,889
DID IT WITH A LOT OF HELP FROM 

1579
00:47:05,889 --> 00:47:06,756
THE KURDS. 

1580
00:47:06,756 --> 00:47:08,091
THEY ARE GREAT FIGHTERS. 

1581
00:47:08,091 --> 00:47:10,127
SOME ARE GREAT FIGHTERS AND 

1582
00:47:10,127 --> 00:47:10,460
SOME AREN'T. 

1583
00:47:10,460 --> 00:47:11,328
THE KURDS ARE GREAT FIGHTERS 

1584
00:47:11,328 --> 00:47:12,429
AND GREAT PEOPLE. 

1585
00:47:12,429 --> 00:47:13,931
WE ARE DISCUSSING THAT 

1586
00:47:13,931 --> 00:47:15,432
SITUATION RIGHT NOW. 

1587
00:47:15,432 --> 00:47:17,500
>> WHAT WILL YOU DO SUIT TO 

1588
00:47:17,500 --> 00:47:19,002
SUPPORT THIS? 

1589
00:47:19,002 --> 00:47:22,072
>> I'M TELLING YOU WE HAVE 

1590
00:47:22,072 --> 00:47:24,608
ALREADY STARTED DISCUSSING THAT 

1591
00:47:24,608 --> 00:47:24,908
SITUATION. 

1592
00:47:24,908 --> 00:47:25,575
WE'VE HAD TREMENDOUS SUPPORT 

1593
00:47:25,575 --> 00:47:26,309
FROM THE KURDS AND DEFEATING 

1594
00:47:26,309 --> 00:47:26,977
ISIS. 

1595
00:47:26,977 --> 00:47:33,050
>> ABOUT SYRIA? 

1596
00:47:33,050 --> 00:47:38,355
>> MR. PRESIDENT, SUSAN LEE 

1597
00:47:38,355 --> 00:47:38,755
FROM FOXBUSINESS. 

1598
00:47:38,755 --> 00:47:39,822
DID YOU REJECT A ONE-ON-ONE 

1599
00:47:39,822 --> 00:47:41,024
MEETING WITH THE CANADIAN PRIME 

1600
00:47:41,024 --> 00:47:42,059
MINISTER, JUSTIN TRUDEAU? 

1601
00:47:42,059 --> 00:47:43,694
>> YEAH, I DID. 

1602
00:47:43,694 --> 00:47:43,927
>> WHY? 

1603
00:47:43,927 --> 00:47:45,729
>> IS TARIFFS ARE TOO HIGH AND 

1604
00:47:45,729 --> 00:47:46,930
HE DOESN'T WANT TO MOVE AND I 

1605
00:47:46,930 --> 00:47:48,498
TOLD HIM FORGET ABOUT IT. 

1606
00:47:48,498 --> 00:47:50,500
WE ARE THINKING OF TAXING CARS 

1607
00:47:50,500 --> 00:47:52,569
COMING IN FROM CANADA, THAT IS 

1608
00:47:52,569 --> 00:47:55,339
THE MOTHER LODE, THE BIG ONE. 

1609
00:47:55,339 --> 00:47:57,708
WE ARE VERY UNHAPPY WITH THE 

1610
00:47:57,708 --> 00:47:58,775
NEGOTIATIONS AND THE NEGOTIATING

1611
00:47:58,775 --> 00:47:59,909
STYLE OF CANADA. 

1612
00:47:59,909 --> 00:48:00,711
WE DON'T LIKE THEIR 

1613
00:48:00,711 --> 00:48:01,745
REPRESENTATIVE VERY MUCH. 

1614
00:48:01,745 --> 00:48:02,980
I LOVE CANADA, BY THE WAY. 

1615
00:48:02,980 --> 00:48:06,483
I HAVE SO MANY FRIENDS, I LOVE 

1616
00:48:06,483 --> 00:48:06,783
EVERYBODY. 

1617
00:48:06,783 --> 00:48:09,786
SO MANY FRIENDS BUT THAT HAS 

1618
00:48:09,786 --> 00:48:10,721
NOTHING TO DO WITH THIS. 

1619
00:48:10,721 --> 00:48:12,322
I'M REPRESENTING THE UNITED 

1620
00:48:12,322 --> 00:48:12,556
STATES. 

1621
00:48:12,556 --> 00:48:14,124
MEXICO WAS TOTALLY GREAT. 

1622
00:48:14,124 --> 00:48:16,460
BY THE WAY, THE NEW PRESIDENT 

1623
00:48:16,460 --> 00:48:18,128
HAS BEEN GREAT. 

1624
00:48:18,128 --> 00:48:19,563
THE DEAL IS DONE. 

1625
00:48:19,563 --> 00:48:20,630
NOW, HAS TO GO THROUGH CONGRESS 

1626
00:48:20,630 --> 00:48:23,934
AND A LOT OF THINGS HAVE TO 

1627
00:48:23,934 --> 00:48:24,934
HAPPEN BUT BOB LIGHT HAUSER, 

1628
00:48:24,934 --> 00:48:27,871
WHO IS HERE SOMEPLACE -- HE HAS 

1629
00:48:27,871 --> 00:48:31,308
DONE A GREAT JOB OF 

1630
00:48:31,308 --> 00:48:32,609
NEGOTIATING, AS THEY HAVE. 

1631
00:48:32,609 --> 00:48:35,245
THE DEAL IS DONE FOR CONGRESS. 

1632
00:48:35,245 --> 00:48:37,714
CANADA HAS TREATED US VERY 

1633
00:48:37,714 --> 00:48:37,947
BADLY. 

1634
00:48:37,947 --> 00:48:38,882
THEY'VE TREATED OUR FARMERS IN 

1635
00:48:38,882 --> 00:48:39,916
WISCONSIN AND NEW YORK STATE 

1636
00:48:39,916 --> 00:48:43,553
AND OTHER STATES VERY BADLY. 

1637
00:48:43,553 --> 00:48:44,454
DAIRY PRODUCTS, 300%, 300%. 

1638
00:48:44,454 --> 00:48:50,293
HOW DO SALLY -- HOW DO YOU SELL 

1639
00:48:50,293 --> 00:48:50,993
DAIRY PRODUCTS AT 300%? 

1640
00:48:50,993 --> 00:48:56,900
IT IS A BARRIER. 

1641
00:48:56,900 --> 00:49:00,737
BY THE WAY, 300% BECAUSE YOU 

1642
00:49:00,737 --> 00:49:01,070
CAN COMPETE. 

1643
00:49:01,070 --> 00:49:02,005
CANADA HAS A LONG WAY TO GO. 

1644
00:49:02,005 --> 00:49:03,607
WE ARE NOT GETTING ALONG WITH 

1645
00:49:03,607 --> 00:49:04,173
THEIR NEGOTIATORS. 

1646
00:49:04,173 --> 00:49:06,009
WE THINK THEY HAVE TAKEN 

1647
00:49:06,009 --> 00:49:06,743
ADVANTAGE OF OUR COUNTRY. 

1648
00:49:06,743 --> 00:49:10,113
WE HAVE PEOPLE THAT OVER THE 

1649
00:49:10,113 --> 00:49:16,787
LAST FIVE OR SIX YEARS, WE HAD 

1650
00:49:16,787 --> 00:49:18,055
$800 BILLION A YEAR IN TRADE 

1651
00:49:18,055 --> 00:49:18,288
LOSSES. 

1652
00:49:18,288 --> 00:49:19,423
IT'S RIDICULOUS AND IT WON'T 

1653
00:49:19,423 --> 00:49:22,259
HAPPEN. 

1654
00:49:22,259 --> 00:49:23,226
>> WHAT ABOUT NAFTA? 

1655
00:49:23,226 --> 00:49:24,127
MR. PRESIDENT, WHAT DOES THAT 

1656
00:49:24,127 --> 00:49:24,794
MEAN FOR NAFTA? 

1657
00:49:24,794 --> 00:49:29,032
WILL YOU BE PULLING OUT OF 

1658
00:49:29,032 --> 00:49:29,265
NAFTA? 

1659
00:49:29,265 --> 00:49:30,200
>> I DON'T LIKE NAFTA. 

1660
00:49:30,200 --> 00:49:30,800
I NEVER LIKED IT. 

1661
00:49:30,800 --> 00:49:33,003
IT'S BEEN VERY BAD FOR THE 

1662
00:49:33,003 --> 00:49:36,473
UNITED STATES. 

1663
00:49:36,473 --> 00:49:38,675
GREAT FOR CANADA AND MEXICO. I 

1664
00:49:38,675 --> 00:49:41,111
WON'T USE THE NAME NAFTA. I 

1665
00:49:41,111 --> 00:49:41,711
REFUSE TO USE IT. 

1666
00:49:41,711 --> 00:49:42,879
I'VE SEEN THOUSANDS OF PLANTS 

1667
00:49:42,879 --> 00:49:44,181
AND FACTORIES CLOSE AND 

1668
00:49:44,181 --> 00:49:49,453
MILLIONS OF JOBS LOST TO OIL 

1669
00:49:49,453 --> 00:49:50,787
COMPANIES AND MEXICO IS 25% OF 

1670
00:49:50,787 --> 00:49:51,520
OUR AUTO BUSINESS BECAUSEOF 

1671
00:49:51,520 --> 00:49:52,055
NAFTA. 

1672
00:49:52,055 --> 00:49:55,725
UNDER OUR DEAL IT WON'T HAPPEN 

1673
00:49:55,725 --> 00:49:55,992
ANYMORE. 

1674
00:49:55,992 --> 00:49:57,227
I HATE TO TELL YOU IT'S NOT. 

1675
00:49:57,227 --> 00:49:58,428
WE WILL KEEP COMPANIES AND I 

1676
00:49:58,428 --> 00:50:00,931
TOLD THE MEXICANS WE HAVE TO 

1677
00:50:00,931 --> 00:50:04,534
KEEP COMPANIES. THEY ARE 

1678
00:50:04,534 --> 00:50:05,802
GETTING A LOT OF GOOD THINGS. 

1679
00:50:05,802 --> 00:50:07,437
MEXICO MADE A VERY GOOD DEAL. 

1680
00:50:07,437 --> 00:50:08,605
WITH CANADA, IT'S VERY TOUGH. 

1681
00:50:08,605 --> 00:50:11,074
WHAT WE ARE DOING, IF WE MADE A 

1682
00:50:11,074 --> 00:50:12,909
DEAL WITH CANADA, WHICH IS A 

1683
00:50:12,909 --> 00:50:15,178
GOOD CHANCE, BUT I'M NOT MAKING 

1684
00:50:15,178 --> 00:50:16,346
ANYTHING NEAR WHAT THEY WANT TO 

1685
00:50:16,346 --> 00:50:16,580
DO. 

1686
00:50:16,580 --> 00:50:17,413
>> YOU WILL NOTIFY CONGRESS? 

1687
00:50:17,413 --> 00:50:24,054
>> WE WILL PROBABLY CALL IT THE 

1688
00:50:24,054 --> 00:50:25,455
U.S. MC, LIKE THE UNITED STATES 

1689
00:50:25,455 --> 00:50:27,457
MARINE CORPS, WHICH I LOVE IN 

1690
00:50:27,457 --> 00:50:28,358
GENERAL KELLY LIKES IT EVEN 

1691
00:50:28,358 --> 00:50:28,692
MORE. 

1692
00:50:28,692 --> 00:50:29,192
WHERE IS GENERAL KELLY? 

1693
00:50:29,192 --> 00:50:31,995
HE LIKES THAT. 

1694
00:50:31,995 --> 00:50:41,638
IT WOULD BE PROBABLY JUST USM, 

1695
00:50:41,638 --> 00:50:42,472
UNITED STATES AND MEXICO. 

1696
00:50:42,472 --> 00:50:44,174
IF CANADA DOESN'T MAKE A DEAL 

1697
00:50:44,174 --> 00:50:45,909
WITH US, WE WILL MAKE A BETTER 

1698
00:50:45,909 --> 00:50:47,310
DEAL AND WE WILL TAX THE CARS 

1699
00:50:47,310 --> 00:50:51,715
THAT COME IN AND PUT BILLIONS 

1700
00:50:51,715 --> 00:50:52,482
AND BILLIONS OF DOLLARS INTO 

1701
00:50:52,482 --> 00:50:54,918
OUR TREASURY AND FRANKLY WE 

1702
00:50:54,918 --> 00:50:55,852
WILL BE HAPPY BECAUSE IT'S 

1703
00:50:55,852 --> 00:50:56,787
ACTUALLY MORE MONEY THAN YOU 

1704
00:50:56,787 --> 00:50:57,988
CAN MAKE UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCE 

1705
00:50:57,988 --> 00:50:58,822
WITH MAKING A DEAL. 

1706
00:50:58,822 --> 00:50:59,356
GOOD JOB. 

1707
00:50:59,356 --> 00:51:08,932
VERY GOOD JOB. 

1708
00:51:08,932 --> 00:51:10,133
YES PLEASE, MR. KURD. 

1709
00:51:10,133 --> 00:51:14,603
>> THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME MR. 

1710
00:51:14,603 --> 00:51:15,338
PRESIDENT. 

1711
00:51:15,338 --> 00:51:21,845
TWO QUICK QUESTIONS. 

1712
00:51:21,845 --> 00:51:23,313
WHAT WILL BE THE USA RELATIONS 

1713
00:51:23,313 --> 00:51:24,280
WITH THE KURDS? 

1714
00:51:24,280 --> 00:51:25,048
POST ISIS. 

1715
00:51:25,048 --> 00:51:28,318
>> WE ARE TRYING TO GET ALONG 

1716
00:51:28,318 --> 00:51:28,618
VERY WELL. 

1717
00:51:28,618 --> 00:51:31,555
WE DO GET ALONG GREAT WITH THE 

1718
00:51:31,555 --> 00:51:31,788
KURDS. 

1719
00:51:31,788 --> 00:51:32,656
DON'T FORGET THAT IS THEIR 

1720
00:51:32,656 --> 00:51:35,192
TERRITORY AND WE HAVE TO HELP 

1721
00:51:35,192 --> 00:51:35,392
THEM. 

1722
00:51:35,392 --> 00:51:38,762
I WANT TO HELP THEM. 

1723
00:51:38,762 --> 00:51:40,063
THEY FOUGHT WITH US AND DIED 

1724
00:51:40,063 --> 00:51:40,329
WITH US. 

1725
00:51:40,329 --> 00:51:41,298
WE LOST TENS OF THOUSANDS OF 

1726
00:51:41,298 --> 00:51:45,035
KURDS DIED FIGHTING ISIS. 

1727
00:51:45,035 --> 00:51:46,870
THEY DIED FOR US AND WITH US 

1728
00:51:46,870 --> 00:51:47,303
AND FOR THEMSELVES. 

1729
00:51:47,303 --> 00:51:48,205
THEY DIED FOR THEMSELVES BUT 

1730
00:51:48,205 --> 00:51:50,273
THEY ARE GREAT PEOPLE AND WE 

1731
00:51:50,273 --> 00:51:51,007
DON'T FORGET. 

1732
00:51:51,007 --> 00:51:55,312
I DON'T FORGET. 

1733
00:51:55,312 --> 00:51:56,880
I CAN TELL YOU I DON'TFORGET. 

1734
00:51:56,880 --> 00:52:03,353
THESE ARE GREAT PEOPLE. 

1735
00:52:03,353 --> 00:52:05,155
>> MR. PRESIDENT, ONE QUESTION 

1736
00:52:05,155 --> 00:52:05,455
ABOUT IRAN. 

1737
00:52:05,455 --> 00:52:06,790
WHAT IS YOUR PLAN TO STOP A 

1738
00:52:06,790 --> 00:52:08,925
RAINING INFLUENCE IN IRAQ AND 

1739
00:52:08,925 --> 00:52:10,559
SYRIA AND -- 

1740
00:52:10,559 --> 00:52:12,095
>> I THINK I MUST TELL YOU, I 

1741
00:52:12,095 --> 00:52:18,668
DON'T MIND YOUR QUESTIONS. 

1742
00:52:18,668 --> 00:52:20,003
I THINK THERE'S BEEN NO GREATER 

1743
00:52:20,003 --> 00:52:20,737
CHANGE OTHER THAN MAYBE CHINA 

1744
00:52:20,737 --> 00:52:21,905
BECAUSE UNFORTUNATELY, THE 

1745
00:52:21,905 --> 00:52:26,610
MARKETS HAVE DROPPED 30% IN THE 

1746
00:52:26,610 --> 00:52:27,177
LAST FOUR MONTHS, RIGHT? 

1747
00:52:27,177 --> 00:52:28,511
I THINK I WATCHED YOU WHEN YOU 

1748
00:52:28,511 --> 00:52:28,811
SAID THAT. 

1749
00:52:28,811 --> 00:52:33,016
I THINK IT'S ACTUALLY 32%. 

1750
00:52:33,016 --> 00:52:35,986
THEIRS BEEN THAT. 

1751
00:52:35,986 --> 00:52:36,753
BUT EVEN THAT -- BECAUSE CHINA 

1752
00:52:36,753 --> 00:52:44,828
IS A VERY SPECIAL PLACE. 

1753
00:52:44,828 --> 00:52:46,663
AND IRAN IS A VERY SPECIAL 

1754
00:52:46,663 --> 00:52:47,964
PLACE BUT I THINK THERE'S BEEN 

1755
00:52:47,964 --> 00:52:48,831
NO COUNTRY THAT HAS CHANGED SO 

1756
00:52:48,831 --> 00:52:58,241
MUCH AS IRAN. 

1757
00:52:58,241 --> 00:53:00,310
IN THE LAST SIX MONTHS, SINCE I 

1758
00:53:00,310 --> 00:53:01,044
TOOK OFF THE HORRIBLE, HORRIBLE 

1759
00:53:01,044 --> 00:53:02,812
IRAN NUCLEAR DEAL, ONE OF THE 

1760
00:53:02,812 --> 00:53:08,084
DUMBEST DEALS EVER MADE, AND AS 

1761
00:53:08,084 --> 00:53:10,053
AN EXAMPLE, WHY DIDN'T THEY 

1762
00:53:10,053 --> 00:53:12,289
TAKE CARE OF YEMEN AND SYRIA IN 

1763
00:53:12,289 --> 00:53:12,556
THE DEAL? 

1764
00:53:12,556 --> 00:53:14,124
BOB CAREY SAID IT WAS TOO 

1765
00:53:14,124 --> 00:53:14,457
COMPLICATED. 

1766
00:53:14,457 --> 00:53:18,128
WE ARE GIVING $150 BILLION AND 

1767
00:53:18,128 --> 00:53:20,130
WE PAID $1.8 BILLION IN CASH, 

1768
00:53:20,130 --> 00:53:21,131
CASH! 

1769
00:53:21,131 --> 00:53:23,166
THIS WHOLE ROOM WOULD BE FILLED 

1770
00:53:23,166 --> 00:53:25,468
UP WITH 100-DOLLAR BILLS AND 

1771
00:53:25,468 --> 00:53:26,870
INDEED, PROBABLY FIVE ROOMS 

1772
00:53:26,870 --> 00:53:28,772
LIKE THIS. 

1773
00:53:28,772 --> 00:53:31,274
WE GET $1.8 BILLION IN CASH AND 

1774
00:53:31,274 --> 00:53:33,276
WHY DIDN'T WE TAKE CARE OF 

1775
00:53:33,276 --> 00:53:34,210
YEMEN AND SYRIA? 

1776
00:53:34,210 --> 00:53:36,012
HE SAID IT WAS TOO COMPLICATED. 

1777
00:53:36,012 --> 00:53:39,082
YOU JUST GAVE THEM $150 BILLION 

1778
00:53:39,082 --> 00:53:40,116
AND NOW YEMEN IS A MESS. 

1779
00:53:40,116 --> 00:53:41,251
BUT, IT'S GETTING BETTER. 

1780
00:53:41,251 --> 00:53:46,756
SYRIA IS A MESS. I WAS 

1781
00:53:46,756 --> 00:53:47,824
RESPONSIBLE AND I HOPE IT STAYS 

1782
00:53:47,824 --> 00:53:49,392
THAT WAY WHEN I PUT ON ON 

1783
00:53:49,392 --> 00:53:54,230
SOCIAL MEDIA, IF YOU WEEKS AGO, 

1784
00:53:54,230 --> 00:53:55,898
ABOUT IDLIB PROVINCE. 

1785
00:53:55,898 --> 00:53:56,966
I SAID, DON'T DO IT. 

1786
00:53:56,966 --> 00:53:58,868
I WILL TELL YOU, IT HAPPENED 

1787
00:53:58,868 --> 00:54:01,004
WHERE I WAS AT A MEETING WITH 

1788
00:54:01,004 --> 00:54:03,673
THE LOT OF SUPPORTERS AND A 

1789
00:54:03,673 --> 00:54:06,009
WOMAN STOOD UP AND SAID, THERE 

1790
00:54:06,009 --> 00:54:08,745
IS A PROVINCE IN SYRIA WITH 3 

1791
00:54:08,745 --> 00:54:10,513
MILLION PEOPLE IN RIGHT NOW THE 

1792
00:54:10,513 --> 00:54:11,481
IRANIANS AND THE RUSSIANS AND 

1793
00:54:11,481 --> 00:54:12,382
SYRIANS ARE SURROUNDING THAT 

1794
00:54:12,382 --> 00:54:13,917
PROVINCE AND THEY ARE GOING TO 

1795
00:54:13,917 --> 00:54:16,252
KILL MY SISTER AND THEY'RE 

1796
00:54:16,252 --> 00:54:17,287
GOING TO KILL MILLIONS IN ORDER 

1797
00:54:17,287 --> 00:54:20,657
TO GET RID OF 25,000 OR 35,000 

1798
00:54:20,657 --> 00:54:21,791
TERRORISTS OR ENEMIES OF 

1799
00:54:21,791 --> 00:54:22,024
THEIRS. 

1800
00:54:22,024 --> 00:54:23,326
I THINK WE CAN CALL THEM 

1801
00:54:23,326 --> 00:54:27,163
TERRORISTS. 

1802
00:54:27,163 --> 00:54:28,264
I SAID, THAT'S NOT GOING TO 

1803
00:54:28,264 --> 00:54:28,497
HAPPEN. 

1804
00:54:28,497 --> 00:54:30,533
I DIDN'T HEAR OF IDLIB PROVINCE 

1805
00:54:30,533 --> 00:54:37,607
AND I CAME BACK TO NEW YORK. I 

1806
00:54:37,607 --> 00:54:39,876
PICKED UP THE FAILING NEW YORK 

1807
00:54:39,876 --> 00:54:40,109
TIMES. 

1808
00:54:40,109 --> 00:54:42,078
I HATE TO ADMIT IT, BUT IT WAS 

1809
00:54:42,078 --> 00:54:43,279
THE FAILING NEW YORK TIMES AND 

1810
00:54:43,279 --> 00:54:44,113
I OPENED IT UP. 

1811
00:54:44,113 --> 00:54:46,149
THERE WAS A VERY BIG STORY NOT 

1812
00:54:46,149 --> 00:54:47,817
ON THE FRONT PAGE AND I SAID 

1813
00:54:47,817 --> 00:54:49,018
IT'S THE SAME STORY THAT THE 

1814
00:54:49,018 --> 00:54:50,153
WOMAN TOLD ME. 

1815
00:54:50,153 --> 00:54:52,522
I FOUND IT HARD TO BELIEVE THAT 

1816
00:54:52,522 --> 00:54:53,790
HOW COULD ANYBODY DO THAT WITH 

1817
00:54:53,790 --> 00:54:55,258
3 MILLION PEOPLE AND IT SAID 

1818
00:54:55,258 --> 00:54:56,626
THEY WERE BEING SURROUNDED AND 

1819
00:54:56,626 --> 00:54:58,528
THEY WERE GOING IN AND STARTING 

1820
00:54:58,528 --> 00:54:59,662
LITERALLY THE NEXT DAY TO DROP 

1821
00:54:59,662 --> 00:55:01,097
BOMBS ALL OVER THE PLACE AND 

1822
00:55:01,097 --> 00:55:05,335
PERHAPS KILL MILLIONS OF PEOPLE 

1823
00:55:05,335 --> 00:55:08,671
IN ORDER TO GET 35,000 

1824
00:55:08,671 --> 00:55:10,307
TERRORISTS. I 

1825
00:55:10,307 --> 00:55:11,541
PUT OUT ON SOCIAL MEDIA AND 

1826
00:55:11,541 --> 00:55:12,609
ELSEWHERE AND GAVE MIKE POMPEO 

1827
00:55:12,609 --> 00:55:13,543
AND JOHN BOLTON AND EVERYBODY 

1828
00:55:13,543 --> 00:55:14,044
THESE ORDERS. 

1829
00:55:14,044 --> 00:55:14,511
DON'T LET IT HAPPEN. 

1830
00:55:14,511 --> 00:55:16,980
I SAID DON'T LET IT HAPPEN. 

1831
00:55:16,980 --> 00:55:19,916
THAT DOESN'T MEAN THEY CAN'T BE 

1832
00:55:19,916 --> 00:55:25,188
SELECTIVE THAT THEY CAN'T GO 

1833
00:55:25,188 --> 00:55:25,354
IN. 

1834
00:55:25,354 --> 00:55:26,523
THEY WILL DO WHAT THEY HAVE TO 

1835
00:55:26,523 --> 00:55:29,426
DO WITH TERRORISTS, BUT DON'T 

1836
00:55:29,426 --> 00:55:34,931
KILL MILLIONS OF PEOPLE. 

1837
00:55:34,931 --> 00:55:35,831
IT STOPPED. 

1838
00:55:35,831 --> 00:55:37,367
YOU SAW THAT. 

1839
00:55:37,367 --> 00:55:39,301
NOBODY'S GOING TO GIVE ME 

1840
00:55:39,301 --> 00:55:40,870
CREDIT, BUT THAT'S OKAY. 

1841
00:55:40,870 --> 00:55:42,872
THAT'S OKAY BECAUSE THE PEOPLE 

1842
00:55:42,872 --> 00:55:43,072
KNOW. 

1843
00:55:43,072 --> 00:55:44,841
I'VE HAD MORE SYRIANS THANK ME 

1844
00:55:44,841 --> 00:55:45,575
FOR THAT. 

1845
00:55:45,575 --> 00:55:47,343
THIS WAS ABOUT FOUR WEEKS AGO I 

1846
00:55:47,343 --> 00:55:49,012
PUT THAT OUT. 

1847
00:55:49,012 --> 00:55:50,079
I SAID THEY ARE SURROUNDING A 

1848
00:55:50,079 --> 00:55:52,415
CITY OF 3 MILLION PEOPLE AND 

1849
00:55:52,415 --> 00:55:53,616
THEY ARE GOING TO START BOMBING 

1850
00:55:53,616 --> 00:55:53,882
THE CITY. 

1851
00:55:53,882 --> 00:55:59,055
DON'T LET IT HAPPEN. 

1852
00:55:59,055 --> 00:56:01,057
AND, I MEANT IT, TOO. I 

1853
00:56:01,057 --> 00:56:01,691
MEANT IT. 

1854
00:56:01,691 --> 00:56:03,426
MILLIONS HAVE BEEN SAVED AND 

1855
00:56:03,426 --> 00:56:06,463
TODAY, I GAVE GREAT CREDIT TO 

1856
00:56:06,463 --> 00:56:06,663
IRAN. 

1857
00:56:06,663 --> 00:56:08,898
I DON'T KNOW IF YOU HEARD THAT. 

1858
00:56:08,898 --> 00:56:11,301
I GAVE GREAT CREDIT TO IRAN AND 

1859
00:56:11,301 --> 00:56:14,304
TO RUSSIA AND TO SYRIA FOR NOT 

1860
00:56:14,304 --> 00:56:14,571
DOING IT. 

1861
00:56:14,571 --> 00:56:15,604
NOW, I HOPE IT'S GOING TO BE 

1862
00:56:15,604 --> 00:56:16,306
SURGICAL. 

1863
00:56:16,306 --> 00:56:21,543
MEANING, GO IN AND DO IT. 

1864
00:56:21,543 --> 00:56:23,279
IT'S LENGTHY AND EVERYTHING 

1865
00:56:23,279 --> 00:56:23,479
ELSE. 

1866
00:56:23,479 --> 00:56:24,581
THEY POSSIBLY HAVE TO DO IT. 

1867
00:56:24,581 --> 00:56:26,316
BUT, I THINK MILLIONS WOULD 

1868
00:56:26,316 --> 00:56:28,117
HAVE BEEN KILLED AND THAT WOULD 

1869
00:56:28,117 --> 00:56:29,018
HAVE BEEN A SHAME. 

1870
00:56:29,018 --> 00:56:31,688
HOPEFULLY -- AND I HAVE TO TELL 

1871
00:56:31,688 --> 00:56:34,724
YOU, TURKEY HAS BEEN A BIG 

1872
00:56:34,724 --> 00:56:34,957
HELP. 

1873
00:56:34,957 --> 00:56:35,458
TURKEY HAS BEEN GREAT. 

1874
00:56:35,458 --> 00:56:39,629
TURKEY HELPED US WITH THAT WHOLE

1875
00:56:39,629 --> 00:56:40,930
SITUATION. 

1876
00:56:40,930 --> 00:56:42,766
>> THANK YOU, MR. PRESIDENT. 

1877
00:56:42,766 --> 00:56:45,034
TOUCHING BACK ON BACK ON IRAN, 

1878
00:56:45,034 --> 00:56:47,137
OF COURSE THIS WEEK YOU PUT OUT 

1879
00:56:47,137 --> 00:56:48,905
A CALL TO ACTION TO OTHER 

1880
00:56:48,905 --> 00:56:50,073
COUNTRIES TO RALLY WITH AMERICA 

1881
00:56:50,073 --> 00:56:51,641
TO PUT PRESSURE ON IRAN. 

1882
00:56:51,641 --> 00:56:53,009
ROUHANI STILL CALLING FOR THE 

1883
00:56:53,009 --> 00:56:55,445
U.S. TO COME BACK TO THE OLD 

1884
00:56:55,445 --> 00:56:55,645
DEAL. 

1885
00:56:55,645 --> 00:56:57,414
AFTER MEETING WITH WORLD 

1886
00:56:57,414 --> 00:56:58,982
LEADERS DID YOU MAKE ANY 

1887
00:56:58,982 --> 00:57:00,116
PROGRESS TOWARD A POTENTIAL NEW 

1888
00:57:00,116 --> 00:57:00,683
DEAL? 

1889
00:57:00,683 --> 00:57:01,751
>> IT DOESN'T MATTER WHAT WORLD 

1890
00:57:01,751 --> 00:57:03,586
LEADERS THINK ON IRAN. 

1891
00:57:03,586 --> 00:57:05,722
IRAN IS COMING BACK TO ME AND 

1892
00:57:05,722 --> 00:57:08,925
THEY WILL MAKE A BIG DEAL. I 

1893
00:57:08,925 --> 00:57:10,159
THINK, MAYBE NOT. 

1894
00:57:10,159 --> 00:57:12,428
DEAL, YOU NEVER KNOW. 

1895
00:57:12,428 --> 00:57:15,932
THEY ARE SUFFERING GREATLY. 

1896
00:57:15,932 --> 00:57:16,966
THEY'RE HAVING RIOTS IN EVERY 

1897
00:57:16,966 --> 00:57:17,166
CITY. 

1898
00:57:17,166 --> 00:57:17,967
FAR GREATER THAN THEY WERE 

1899
00:57:17,967 --> 00:57:19,536
DURING THE GREEN PERIOD WITH 

1900
00:57:19,536 --> 00:57:21,604
PRESIDENT OBAMA. 

1901
00:57:21,604 --> 00:57:23,006
FAR GREATER WHEN PRESIDENT 

1902
00:57:23,006 --> 00:57:24,808
OBAMA STUCK UP FOR GOVERNMENT, 

1903
00:57:24,808 --> 00:57:25,308
NOT THE PEOPLE. 

1904
00:57:25,308 --> 00:57:26,743
HE PROBABLY WOULD HAVE HAD A 

1905
00:57:26,743 --> 00:57:28,545
MUCH DIFFERENT IRAN HAD HE NOT 

1906
00:57:28,545 --> 00:57:31,281
DONE THAT BUT I'M STICKING UP 

1907
00:57:31,281 --> 00:57:32,515
FOR THE PEOPLE. 

1908
00:57:32,515 --> 00:57:34,049
I AM WITH THE PEOPLE OF IRAN. 

1909
00:57:34,049 --> 00:57:34,984
HERE'S THE THING. 

1910
00:57:34,984 --> 00:57:35,819
THEY HAVE RAMPANT INFLATION. 

1911
00:57:35,819 --> 00:57:41,291
THEIR MONEY IS THIS -- THEIR 

1912
00:57:41,291 --> 00:57:42,458
MONEY IS WORTHLESS. 

1913
00:57:42,458 --> 00:57:43,960
YOU CAN'T BUY BREAD, YOU CAN'T 

1914
00:57:43,960 --> 00:57:45,028
DO ANYTHING. 

1915
00:57:45,028 --> 00:57:46,161
IT'S A DISASTER. 

1916
00:57:46,161 --> 00:57:48,164
I THINK THEY WILL WANT TO COME 

1917
00:57:48,164 --> 00:57:50,900
BACK AND SAY, CAN WE DO 

1918
00:57:50,900 --> 00:57:51,200
SOMETHING? 

1919
00:57:51,200 --> 00:57:52,502
VERY SIMPLE, I JUST DON'T WANT 

1920
00:57:52,502 --> 00:57:54,036
THEM TO HAVE NUCLEAR WEAPONS. 

1921
00:57:54,036 --> 00:57:55,505
IS THAT TOO MUCH TO ASK? 

1922
00:57:55,505 --> 00:57:58,007
I DON'T WANT THEM TO HAVE 

1923
00:57:58,007 --> 00:57:58,808
NUCLEAR WEAPONS. I 

1924
00:57:58,808 --> 00:58:00,710
WANT THEM TO HAVE A GREAT 

1925
00:58:00,710 --> 00:58:02,178
ECONOMY AND SELL SO MUCH OIL. 

1926
00:58:02,178 --> 00:58:04,848
I'M NOT HAPPY WITH OPEC AND I 

1927
00:58:04,848 --> 00:58:06,749
TOLD THEM, I'M NOT HAPPY WITH 

1928
00:58:06,749 --> 00:58:06,949
OPEC. 

1929
00:58:06,949 --> 00:58:08,151
WE TAKE CARE OF THESE PEOPLE 

1930
00:58:08,151 --> 00:58:09,552
AND DEFEND THEM AND THEY 

1931
00:58:09,552 --> 00:58:11,087
WOULDN'T BE THERE FOR TWO WEEKS 

1932
00:58:11,087 --> 00:58:15,291
IF IT WASN'T FOR ME AND THE 

1933
00:58:15,291 --> 00:58:16,526
U.S. AND A MUCH STRONGER ARMED 

1934
00:58:16,526 --> 00:58:17,393
FORCES THAN IT WAS. 

1935
00:58:17,393 --> 00:58:20,529
OUR ARMED FORCES WERE DEPLETED. 

1936
00:58:20,529 --> 00:58:25,067
YOU KNOW BETTER THAN ANYBODY, 

1937
00:58:25,067 --> 00:58:25,701
$700,000,000,000.716 BILLION, 

1938
00:58:25,701 --> 00:58:27,069
THE MOST INCREDIBLE NEW JETS 

1939
00:58:27,069 --> 00:58:27,436
AND EVERYTHING. 

1940
00:58:27,436 --> 00:58:28,170
WE NEED IT. 

1941
00:58:28,170 --> 00:58:30,073
NOT THAT I WANT TO SPEND IT, 

1942
00:58:30,073 --> 00:58:31,307
ALTHOUGH IT IS JOBS AND ALL 

1943
00:58:31,307 --> 00:58:32,375
MADE IN THE UNITED STATES. 

1944
00:58:32,375 --> 00:58:33,776
IRAN HAS TO COME BACK AND THEY 

1945
00:58:33,776 --> 00:58:39,048
HAVE TO TALK. 

1946
00:58:39,048 --> 00:58:40,550
I'M NOT DOING THIS FROM 

1947
00:58:40,550 --> 00:58:42,051
STRENGTH OR WEAKNESS. 

1948
00:58:42,051 --> 00:58:43,552
I'M JUST SAYING, AT SOME POINT, 

1949
00:58:43,552 --> 00:58:46,155
THEY HAVE TO COME BACK. 

1950
00:58:46,155 --> 00:58:48,458
IF YOU LOOK AT WHAT IS GOING ON,

1951
00:58:48,458 --> 00:58:49,659
COMPANIES ARE LEAVING LEFT AND 

1952
00:58:49,659 --> 00:58:49,892
RIGHT. 

1953
00:58:49,892 --> 00:58:50,960
MERCEDES BENZ JUST LEFT. 

1954
00:58:50,960 --> 00:58:51,928
THEY ARE ALL LEAVING. 

1955
00:58:51,928 --> 00:58:53,830
THEY DON'T WANT TO BE IN IRAN 

1956
00:58:53,830 --> 00:58:55,330
BECAUSE THEY HAVE A CHOICE. 

1957
00:58:55,330 --> 00:58:56,799
DO THEY WANT TO BE WITH IRAN OR 

1958
00:58:56,799 --> 00:59:00,069
DO THEY WANT TO BE WITH US? 

1959
00:59:00,069 --> 00:59:04,908
WE PICKED UP $10 TRILLION SINCE 

1960
00:59:04,908 --> 00:59:05,241
MY ELECTION. 

1961
00:59:05,241 --> 00:59:07,577
WERE BEING CAUGHT BY CHINA AND 

1962
00:59:07,577 --> 00:59:09,746
NOW IT'S GOING THE OTHER WAY. 

1963
00:59:09,746 --> 00:59:11,381
PEOPLE CAN'T BELIEVE IT. 

1964
00:59:11,381 --> 00:59:12,916
THEY'VE NEVER SEEN THIS 

1965
00:59:12,916 --> 00:59:13,483
SITUATION WITH CHINA. 

1966
00:59:13,483 --> 00:59:16,486
CHINA IS SO GREAT, FOR 20 

1967
00:59:16,486 --> 00:59:17,620
YEARS, CHINA IS SO GREAT AND 

1968
00:59:17,620 --> 00:59:18,888
YOU DON'T HEAR THAT SO MUCH 

1969
00:59:18,888 --> 00:59:19,155
ANYMORE. 

1970
00:59:19,155 --> 00:59:20,923
I LOVE CHINA AND I THINK THEY 

1971
00:59:20,923 --> 00:59:21,758
ARE GREAT. 

1972
00:59:21,758 --> 00:59:23,993
YOU DON'T HEAR THAT SO MUCH 

1973
00:59:23,993 --> 00:59:24,260
ANYMORE. 

1974
00:59:24,260 --> 00:59:25,061
DO YOU KNOW WHO IS GREAT? 

1975
00:59:25,061 --> 00:59:25,628
WE ARE GREAT. 

1976
00:59:25,628 --> 00:59:26,829
JUST A COUPLE MORE. I 

1977
00:59:26,829 --> 00:59:31,834
COULD DO THIS ALL DAY LONG. 

1978
00:59:31,834 --> 00:59:34,270
I COULD DO THIS ALL DAY LONG. 

1979
00:59:34,270 --> 00:59:35,805
SHOULD BE CONTINUED FOR A 

1980
00:59:35,805 --> 00:59:37,106
LITTLE WHILE? 

1981
00:59:37,106 --> 00:59:39,208
IT DOESN'T MATTER TO ME. 

1982
00:59:39,208 --> 00:59:40,710
A COUPLE OF MORE, I DON'T CARE. 

1983
00:59:40,710 --> 00:59:41,711
NEW YORK TIMES, THE FAILING NEW 

1984
00:59:41,711 --> 00:59:45,014
YORK TIMES, STAND UP. 

1985
00:59:45,014 --> 00:59:46,716
GO AHEAD. 

1986
00:59:46,716 --> 00:59:48,718
I'M TALKING ABOUT THE TIMES IS 

1987
00:59:48,718 --> 00:59:48,985
FAILING. 

1988
00:59:48,985 --> 00:59:50,753
YOU ARE FAR FROM FAILING. 

1989
00:59:50,753 --> 00:59:53,389
>> YOU WERE POINTING AT ME. 

1990
00:59:53,389 --> 00:59:54,390
>> THE TIMES ARE VERY 

1991
00:59:54,390 --> 00:59:54,723
INTERESTING. 

1992
00:59:54,723 --> 00:59:55,591
THE TIMES, I THINK THEY ARE 

1993
00:59:55,591 --> 01:00:00,496
GOING TO ENDORSE ME. 

1994
01:00:00,496 --> 01:00:03,800
I THINK ABC AND FOX -- I LIKE 

1995
01:00:03,800 --> 01:00:05,802
FOX -- I REALLY DO. 

1996
01:00:05,802 --> 01:00:07,870
ABC, CBS, NBC, THEY ALL WILL 

1997
01:00:07,870 --> 01:00:08,905
ENDORSE ME BECAUSE IF THEY 

1998
01:00:08,905 --> 01:00:10,473
DON'T, THEY ARE GOING OUT OF 

1999
01:00:10,473 --> 01:00:10,740
BUSINESS. 

2000
01:00:10,740 --> 01:00:12,675
COULD YOU IMAGINE IF YOU DIDN'T 

2001
01:00:12,675 --> 01:00:13,276
HAVE ME? 

2002
01:00:13,276 --> 01:00:16,045
>> I KNOW YOU ARE POINTING FOR 

2003
01:00:16,045 --> 01:00:18,681
ME BUT I WORK FOR PBS NEWS. 

2004
01:00:18,681 --> 01:00:20,683
>> I KNOW THAT. 

2005
01:00:20,683 --> 01:00:22,719
>> YESTERDAY, YOU WERE TALKING 

2006
01:00:22,719 --> 01:00:24,621
ABOUT YOUR ADMINISTRATION'S 

2007
01:00:24,621 --> 01:00:25,387
ACCOMPLISHMENTS AT THE UNITED 

2008
01:00:25,387 --> 01:00:26,756
NATIONS AND A LOT OF THE 

2009
01:00:26,756 --> 01:00:27,690
LEADERS LAUGHED. 

2010
01:00:27,690 --> 01:00:28,858
>> THAT WAS FAKE NEWS. 

2011
01:00:28,858 --> 01:00:30,193
THAT'S FAKE NEWS AND I KNOW 

2012
01:00:30,193 --> 01:00:32,528
WHAT WAS COVERED THAT WAY. 

2013
01:00:32,528 --> 01:00:33,496
I SAID THAT SINCE MY ELECTION, 

2014
01:00:33,496 --> 01:00:35,198
OUR ECONOMY HAS BECOME THE 

2015
01:00:35,198 --> 01:00:37,567
HOTTEST IN THE WORLD. 

2016
01:00:37,567 --> 01:00:38,334
TAX REDUCTIONS, REGULATIONS, 

2017
01:00:38,334 --> 01:00:41,003
CONFIDENCE LEVELS ARE THE 

2018
01:00:41,003 --> 01:00:46,075
HIGHEST IN 18 YEARS, REALLY 

2019
01:00:46,075 --> 01:00:47,343
SOON TO BE HISTORIC. 

2020
01:00:47,343 --> 01:00:49,679
UNEMPLOYMENT IS THE LOWEST IN 

2021
01:00:49,679 --> 01:00:51,047
THE HISTORY OF OUR COUNTRY. 

2022
01:00:51,047 --> 01:00:53,449
YOU LOOK AT BLACK UNEMPLOYMENT, 

2023
01:00:53,449 --> 01:00:55,017
ASIAN UNEMPLOYMENT AND YOU LOOK 

2024
01:00:55,017 --> 01:00:56,486
AT WOMEN, 65 YEARS, THE 

2025
01:00:56,486 --> 01:00:57,386
UNEMPLOYMENT NUMBERS ON THE 

2026
01:00:57,386 --> 01:00:58,688
AMONG THE BEST WE EVER HAD, 

2027
01:00:58,688 --> 01:01:02,425
EVER. 

2028
01:01:02,425 --> 01:01:03,593
THE NUMBERS OF NEW COMPANIES 

2029
01:01:03,593 --> 01:01:04,360
POURING INTO OUR COUNTRY, WHICH 

2030
01:01:04,360 --> 01:01:08,931
NOBODY THOUGHT WAS POSSIBLE. 

2031
01:01:08,931 --> 01:01:12,135
I SAID THIS AND I WAS IN FRONT 

2032
01:01:12,135 --> 01:01:14,637
OF A LARGE GROUP OF HIGHLY 

2033
01:01:14,637 --> 01:01:15,537
PROFESSIONAL PEOPLE. 

2034
01:01:15,537 --> 01:01:17,473
MOST OF THEM ARE FROM OTHER 

2035
01:01:17,473 --> 01:01:18,508
COUNTRIES OR THE UNITED 

2036
01:01:18,508 --> 01:01:19,409
NATIONS, PEOPLE NOT BIG INTO 

2037
01:01:19,409 --> 01:01:21,010
CLAPPING AND APPLAUDING AND 

2038
01:01:21,010 --> 01:01:23,412
SMILING. I 

2039
01:01:23,412 --> 01:01:25,448
HEARD A LITTLE RUSSELL, AND I 

2040
01:01:25,448 --> 01:01:26,716
SAID OUR COUNTRY IS NOW 

2041
01:01:26,716 --> 01:01:28,451
STRONGER THAN EVER BEFORE AND 

2042
01:01:28,451 --> 01:01:29,151
IT'S TRUE. I 

2043
01:01:29,151 --> 01:01:31,053
HEARD A LITTLE RUSSELL AND I 

2044
01:01:31,053 --> 01:01:32,221
SAID, IT'S TRUE AND IT HURTS 

2045
01:01:32,221 --> 01:01:34,857
MILES AND I SAID I DIDN'T KNOW 

2046
01:01:34,857 --> 01:01:36,759
WHAT -- THEY WEREN'T LAUGHING 

2047
01:01:36,759 --> 01:01:38,261
AT ME, THEY WERE LAUGHING WITH 

2048
01:01:38,261 --> 01:01:38,427
ME. 

2049
01:01:38,427 --> 01:01:38,761
WE HAD FUN. 

2050
01:01:38,761 --> 01:01:42,065
THAT WAS NOT LAUGHING AT ME. 

2051
01:01:42,065 --> 01:01:42,932
FAKE NEWS SAID PEOPLE LAUGHED 

2052
01:01:42,932 --> 01:01:43,632
AT PRESIDENT TRUMP. 

2053
01:01:43,632 --> 01:01:47,170
THEY DIDN'T LAUGH AT ME. 

2054
01:01:47,170 --> 01:01:50,406
PEOPLE HAD A GOOD TIME WITH ME. 

2055
01:01:50,406 --> 01:01:52,041
WE WERE DOING IT TOGETHER. 

2056
01:01:52,041 --> 01:01:54,644
WE HAD A GOOD TIME. 

2057
01:01:54,644 --> 01:01:56,479
THEY RESPECT WHAT I'VE DONE. 

2058
01:01:56,479 --> 01:01:58,714
THE UNITED STATES IS RESPECTED 

2059
01:01:58,714 --> 01:01:59,282
AGAIN. 

2060
01:01:59,282 --> 01:02:01,017
THE UNITED STATES WAS NOT 

2061
01:02:01,017 --> 01:02:01,384
RESPECTED. 

2062
01:02:01,384 --> 01:02:02,218
EVERYBODY WAS TAKING ADVANTAGE 

2063
01:02:02,218 --> 01:02:03,452
OF US FROM JOBS AND TAKING OUR 

2064
01:02:03,452 --> 01:02:04,921
COMPANIES AND NOT PAYING THE 

2065
01:02:04,921 --> 01:02:08,757
PRICE TO SO MANY OTHER THINGS. 

2066
01:02:08,757 --> 01:02:09,291
EVEN MILITARY PROTECTION. 

2067
01:02:09,291 --> 01:02:11,394
I TOLD A NUMBER OF COUNTRIES 

2068
01:02:11,394 --> 01:02:14,063
OVER THE LAST FEW DAYS, I SAID, 

2069
01:02:14,063 --> 01:02:16,098
LISTEN, YOU ARE A VERY RICH 

2070
01:02:16,098 --> 01:02:17,867
COUNTRY AND WE PROTECT YOU. 

2071
01:02:17,867 --> 01:02:18,701
WITHOUT OUR PROTECTION, YOU 

2072
01:02:18,701 --> 01:02:21,437
WOULD HAVE REAL PROBLEMS. 

2073
01:02:21,437 --> 01:02:23,505
YOU WOULD HAVE REAL PROBLEMS. 

2074
01:02:23,505 --> 01:02:24,907
I SAID, YOU SHOULD REIMBURSE US 

2075
01:02:24,907 --> 01:02:25,607
FOR THIS PROTECTION. 

2076
01:02:25,607 --> 01:02:28,244
WHY ARE WE PROTECTING YOU? 

2077
01:02:28,244 --> 01:02:31,180
DO YOU WANT TO KNOW WHAT THEY 

2078
01:02:31,180 --> 01:02:31,547
SAID? 

2079
01:02:31,547 --> 01:02:33,716
AFTER TWO MINUTES OF TALKING? 

2080
01:02:33,716 --> 01:02:35,151
THEY AGREED WITH ME. 

2081
01:02:35,151 --> 01:02:38,120
YOU CAN ASK THIS GROUP OF VERY 

2082
01:02:38,120 --> 01:02:39,188
TALENTED PEOPLE. 

2083
01:02:39,188 --> 01:02:40,756
THEY AGREED WITH ME. 

2084
01:02:40,756 --> 01:02:41,724
THEY SAID -- ONE OF THEM SAID 

2085
01:02:41,724 --> 01:02:43,159
-- MR. PRESIDENT, NOBODY EVER 

2086
01:02:43,159 --> 01:02:45,561
ASKED US US. 

2087
01:02:45,561 --> 01:02:47,563
THEY NEVER ASKED US FOR THAT. 

2088
01:02:47,563 --> 01:02:49,298
NOBODY EVER SAID YOU SHOULD 

2089
01:02:49,298 --> 01:02:49,632
PAY. 

2090
01:02:49,632 --> 01:02:50,632
THESE ARE REALLY WEALTHY 

2091
01:02:50,632 --> 01:02:51,134
COUNTRIES. 

2092
01:02:51,134 --> 01:02:54,437
I WILL BE HONEST, I JUST ASKED 

2093
01:02:54,437 --> 01:02:54,670
JAPAN. 

2094
01:02:54,670 --> 01:02:55,938
I SAID, WE ARE DEFENDING YOU, 

2095
01:02:55,938 --> 01:02:56,772
VERY WEALTHY COUNTRY. 

2096
01:02:56,772 --> 01:02:58,975
YOU SEND US MILLIONS OF CARS 

2097
01:02:58,975 --> 01:03:01,677
AND YOU MAKE A FORTUNE AND WE 

2098
01:03:01,677 --> 01:03:02,812
HAVE A TREMENDOUS TRADE DEFICIT 

2099
01:03:02,812 --> 01:03:05,014
WITH YOU AND WE ARE DEFENDING 

2100
01:03:05,014 --> 01:03:06,182
YOU AND SUBSIDIZING YOUR 

2101
01:03:06,182 --> 01:03:08,517
MILITARY WITH A MASSIVE AMOUNT 

2102
01:03:08,517 --> 01:03:09,385
OF MONEY. 

2103
01:03:09,385 --> 01:03:10,887
I SAID IT TO SOUTH KOREA. 

2104
01:03:10,887 --> 01:03:13,155
WE HAVE 32,000 SOLDIERS IN 

2105
01:03:13,155 --> 01:03:13,488
SOUTH KOREA. 

2106
01:03:13,488 --> 01:03:15,491
THEY ARE VERY WEALTHY AND THESE 

2107
01:03:15,491 --> 01:03:16,592
ARE GREAT COUNTRIES, VERY 

2108
01:03:16,592 --> 01:03:18,160
WEALTHY COUNTRIES. I 

2109
01:03:18,160 --> 01:03:19,495
SAID, WHY AREN'T YOU 

2110
01:03:19,495 --> 01:03:20,863
REIMBURSING US FOR OUR COSTS? 

2111
01:03:20,863 --> 01:03:22,565
THEY LOOKED AT ME AND THEY 

2112
01:03:22,565 --> 01:03:23,366
CAN'T EVEN ANSWER BECAUSE THERE 

2113
01:03:23,366 --> 01:03:24,634
IS NO ANSWER. 

2114
01:03:24,634 --> 01:03:27,169
IF THEY WERE A POOR COUNTRY AND 

2115
01:03:27,169 --> 01:03:28,137
THEY NEED PROTECTION AND PEOPLE 

2116
01:03:28,137 --> 01:03:31,941
WERE GOING TO DIE, I'M ALL FOR 

2117
01:03:31,941 --> 01:03:32,575
PROTECTING THEM AND I DON'T 

2118
01:03:32,575 --> 01:03:33,209
WANT 10 CENTS. 

2119
01:03:33,209 --> 01:03:36,512
WHEN WEALTHY COUNTRIES THAT HAVE

2120
01:03:36,512 --> 01:03:38,614
MASSIVE TRADE SURPLUSES WITH 

2121
01:03:38,614 --> 01:03:40,316
US, MASSIVE -- AND THEN ON TOP 

2122
01:03:40,316 --> 01:03:41,384
OF THAT, WE ARE PAYING FOR 

2123
01:03:41,384 --> 01:03:42,251
THEIR MILITARY OR PAYING FOR 

2124
01:03:42,251 --> 01:03:47,223
LOT OF THEIR MILITAR? 

2125
01:03:47,223 --> 01:03:49,258
>> MR. PRESIDENT, REALLY 

2126
01:03:49,258 --> 01:03:51,494
QUICKLY, YOU SAID YOU FEEL A 

2127
01:03:51,494 --> 01:03:52,061
KINSHIP. 

2128
01:03:52,061 --> 01:03:53,896
YOU SAID YOU FEEL A KINSHIP 

2129
01:03:53,896 --> 01:03:55,331
WITH BRETT KAVANAUGH. 

2130
01:03:55,331 --> 01:03:56,632
REALLY QUICKLY, YOU SAID YOU 

2131
01:03:56,632 --> 01:03:57,567
FELT A KINSHIP WITH BRETT 

2132
01:03:57,567 --> 01:03:58,734
KAVANAUGH AND THAT YOUR FALSE 

2133
01:03:58,734 --> 01:03:59,635
ALLEGATIONS YOU FEEL LIKE WERE 

2134
01:03:59,635 --> 01:04:01,637
MADE AGAINST YOU MAKE YOU FEEL 

2135
01:04:01,637 --> 01:04:03,172
LIKE YOU DON'T WANT TO BELIEVE 

2136
01:04:03,172 --> 01:04:03,673
THESE WOMEN. 

2137
01:04:03,673 --> 01:04:05,808
>> I DIDN'T SAY THAT. 

2138
01:04:05,808 --> 01:04:07,043
WHY DO YOU SAY THAT? 

2139
01:04:07,043 --> 01:04:07,777
FAKE NEWS. 

2140
01:04:07,777 --> 01:04:08,210
DID I SAY THAT? 

2141
01:04:08,210 --> 01:04:08,978
EXCUSE ME. 

2142
01:04:08,978 --> 01:04:11,080
BY THE WAY, I THINK YOU DO A 

2143
01:04:11,080 --> 01:04:12,281
GOOD JOB BUT I DIDN'T SAY THAT. 

2144
01:04:12,281 --> 01:04:14,383
I DO WATCH YOU AND I THINK YOU 

2145
01:04:14,383 --> 01:04:17,019
DO A GOOD JOB. 

2146
01:04:17,019 --> 01:04:19,522
I SAID I LOOK FORWARD TO 

2147
01:04:19,522 --> 01:04:19,855
WATCHING HER. 

2148
01:04:19,855 --> 01:04:21,691
I DO WANT TO HEAR WHAT SHE SAYS 

2149
01:04:21,691 --> 01:04:23,559
AND MAYBE SHE WILL SAY -- I 

2150
01:04:23,559 --> 01:04:25,661
COULD BE CONVINCED OF ANYTHING. 

2151
01:04:25,661 --> 01:04:26,462
MAYBE SHE WILL SAY SOMETHING 

2152
01:04:26,462 --> 01:04:30,132
BUT IN THE MEANTIME, I HAVE TO 

2153
01:04:30,132 --> 01:04:32,335
TELL YOU HE IS ONE OF THE 

2154
01:04:32,335 --> 01:04:33,569
HIGHEST QUALITY HUMAN BEINGS. 

2155
01:04:33,569 --> 01:04:36,072
HE IS A TREMENDOUS MAN, A 

2156
01:04:36,072 --> 01:04:37,139
TREMENDOUS GENIUS, A GREAT 

2157
01:04:37,139 --> 01:04:38,808
INTELLECT. I 

2158
01:04:38,808 --> 01:04:41,010
BELIEVE HE WAS NUMBER ONE AT 

2159
01:04:41,010 --> 01:04:41,210
YALE. 

2160
01:04:41,210 --> 01:04:42,044
IS THAT A CORRECT STATEMENT? 

2161
01:04:42,044 --> 01:04:44,680
HE WAS A GREAT STUDENT IN LAW 

2162
01:04:44,680 --> 01:04:47,550
AND I'VE HEARD HIS NAME -- I 

2163
01:04:47,550 --> 01:04:48,918
DIDN'T KNOW HIM -- DIDN'T KNOW 

2164
01:04:48,918 --> 01:04:50,853
HIM UNTIL THIS WHOLE THING, BUT 

2165
01:04:50,853 --> 01:04:53,289
I'VE HEARD HIS NAME FOR 10 

2166
01:04:53,289 --> 01:04:53,522
YEARS. 

2167
01:04:53,522 --> 01:04:55,391
DO YOU KNOW HOW I HEARD HIS 

2168
01:04:55,391 --> 01:04:56,125
NAME? 

2169
01:04:56,125 --> 01:04:57,560
EVERYBODY SAID HE SHOULD BE ON 

2170
01:04:57,560 --> 01:04:59,695
THE SUPREME COURT AND I SAID, 

2171
01:04:59,695 --> 01:05:00,529
WHO IS HE? 

2172
01:05:00,529 --> 01:05:02,932
THEY SAID HIS NAME WAS BRETT 

2173
01:05:02,932 --> 01:05:04,700
KAVANAUGH AND HE'S THE MOST 

2174
01:05:04,700 --> 01:05:07,003
BRILLIANT PERSON, THE MOST 

2175
01:05:07,003 --> 01:05:07,403
BRILLIANT LAWYER. 

2176
01:05:07,403 --> 01:05:08,404
THEY TALKED ABOUT HIM ON THE 

2177
01:05:08,404 --> 01:05:10,539
SUPREME COURT 10 YEARS AGO. 

2178
01:05:10,539 --> 01:05:11,574
WITH ALL OF THAT, I WANT TO 

2179
01:05:11,574 --> 01:05:14,210
HEAR WHAT SHE HAS TO SAY. 

2180
01:05:14,210 --> 01:05:16,846
>> YOU SAID YOU FEEL LIKE THERE 

2181
01:05:16,846 --> 01:05:17,379
HAVE BEEN NUMEROUS FALSE 

2182
01:05:17,379 --> 01:05:18,047
ALLEGATIONS AGAINST YOU. 

2183
01:05:18,047 --> 01:05:19,215
>> I'VE HAD MANY FALSE 

2184
01:05:19,215 --> 01:05:23,352
STATEMENTS AGAINST ME AND IF 

2185
01:05:23,352 --> 01:05:24,954
THE PRESS WOULD HAVE REPORTED 

2186
01:05:24,954 --> 01:05:26,922
IT, I WOULD HAVE BEEN VERY 

2187
01:05:26,922 --> 01:05:27,155
HAPPY. 

2188
01:05:27,155 --> 01:05:29,959
JOHN ROBERTS WILL TELL YOU AND 

2189
01:05:29,959 --> 01:05:31,227
YOU COVER THE STORY WHERE WOMEN 

2190
01:05:31,227 --> 01:05:33,896
WERE PAID TO SAY BAD THINGS 

2191
01:05:33,896 --> 01:05:34,162
ABOUT ME. 

2192
01:05:34,162 --> 01:05:35,631
SEAN HANNITY COVERED IT AND I 

2193
01:05:35,631 --> 01:05:37,433
WILL TELL YOU THAT WHEN I SAW 

2194
01:05:37,433 --> 01:05:39,268
THAT ON SEAN HANNITY, I 

2195
01:05:39,268 --> 01:05:40,069
ACTUALLY CALLED HIM. 

2196
01:05:40,069 --> 01:05:41,370
BELIEVE IT OR NOT. 

2197
01:05:41,370 --> 01:05:43,906
I DON'T SPEAK TO HIM MUCH BUT I 

2198
01:05:43,906 --> 01:05:44,239
RESPECT HIM. 

2199
01:05:44,239 --> 01:05:46,275
I CALLED HIM AND SAID THIS IS 

2200
01:05:46,275 --> 01:05:47,443
THE BIGGEST STORY, A BIG STORY 

2201
01:05:47,443 --> 01:05:49,845
AND HE AGREED WITH ME AND THE 

2202
01:05:49,845 --> 01:05:52,748
NEXT DAY I PICKED UP THE STORY 

2203
01:05:52,748 --> 01:05:54,383
AND THERE WASN'T ONE WORD ABOUT 

2204
01:05:54,383 --> 01:05:54,549
IT. 

2205
01:05:54,549 --> 01:05:55,618
THE NEXT DAY I WATCHED ABC NEWS 

2206
01:05:55,618 --> 01:05:57,019
AND I WATCHED NBC AND I WATCHED 

2207
01:05:57,019 --> 01:06:05,594
CBS. I DIDN'T WATCH CNN BUT 

2208
01:06:05,594 --> 01:06:07,796
NEXT TIME I'M GOING TO. I 

2209
01:06:07,796 --> 01:06:09,632
WATCHED EVERYTHING AND THERE 

2210
01:06:09,632 --> 01:06:10,566
WASN'T ONE STORY OTHER THAN 

2211
01:06:10,566 --> 01:06:10,766
FOX. 

2212
01:06:10,766 --> 01:06:11,934
AND, IT'S A BIG STORY. 

2213
01:06:11,934 --> 01:06:13,035
ENOUGH. 

2214
01:06:13,035 --> 01:06:15,271
THANK YOU. 

2215
01:06:15,271 --> 01:06:18,774
>> IS IT OKAY IF I GIVE IT TO 

2216
01:06:18,774 --> 01:06:19,575
THE NEW YORK TIMES, MR. 

2217
01:06:19,575 --> 01:06:20,176
PRESIDENT? 

2218
01:06:20,176 --> 01:06:21,109
>> THAT'S ENOUGH. 

2219
01:06:21,109 --> 01:06:21,376
GOOD JOB. 

2220
01:06:21,376 --> 01:06:24,813
>> MR. PRESIDENT, CAN YOU ASK A 

2221
01:06:24,813 --> 01:06:25,781
QUESTION SINCE I AM BEFORE THE 

2222
01:06:25,781 --> 01:06:26,749
NEW YORK TIMES BEFORE THIS 

2223
01:06:26,749 --> 01:06:27,049
GENTLEMAN? 

2224
01:06:27,049 --> 01:06:29,051
I'M ACTUALLY FROM THE NEW YORK 

2225
01:06:29,051 --> 01:06:33,556
TIMES. 

2226
01:06:33,556 --> 01:06:35,024
>> I WILL LET YOU DO IT AFTER 

2227
01:06:35,024 --> 01:06:41,430
HE DOES, IS THAT OKAY? 

2228
01:06:41,430 --> 01:06:43,699
IN HONOR OF A PAPER I ONCE 

2229
01:06:43,699 --> 01:06:44,033
LOVED. 

2230
01:06:44,033 --> 01:06:44,400
>> THANK YOU. 

2231
01:06:44,400 --> 01:06:45,334
>> MR. PRESIDENT, I'M WITH TRUE 

2232
01:06:45,334 --> 01:06:46,168
NEWS AND TODAY YOU MET WITH 

2233
01:06:46,168 --> 01:06:50,272
YAHOO FROM ISRAEL -- YOU MET 

2234
01:06:50,272 --> 01:06:53,008
WITH BENJAMIN NETANYAHU FROM 

2235
01:06:53,008 --> 01:06:56,912
ISRAEL. CAN YOU GIVE US A 

2236
01:06:56,912 --> 01:06:58,747
PREVIEW OF WHAT THIS GREAT 

2237
01:06:58,747 --> 01:06:59,414
DEAL, THE PIECE -- 

2238
01:06:59,414 --> 01:07:00,883
>> IN LOVE TO MAKE A DEAL WITH 

2239
01:07:00,883 --> 01:07:04,587
ISRAELIS AND PALESTINIANS. 

2240
01:07:04,587 --> 01:07:07,022
IT IS A TOUGH DEAL AND I THINK 

2241
01:07:07,022 --> 01:07:08,090
HEALTHCARE IS PROBABLY TOUGHER 

2242
01:07:08,090 --> 01:07:09,992
IF YOU WANT TO KNOW THE TRUTH. 

2243
01:07:09,992 --> 01:07:11,427
IT IS TOUGH AND WE WILL TAKE 

2244
01:07:11,427 --> 01:07:12,328
CARE OF THAT, TOO. 

2245
01:07:12,328 --> 01:07:16,765
THAT'S GOING TO GET TAKEN CARE 

2246
01:07:16,765 --> 01:07:16,931
OF. 

2247
01:07:16,931 --> 01:07:20,369
ALL MY LIFE I'VE HEARD THE DEAL 

2248
01:07:20,369 --> 01:07:21,670
BETWEEN, AS YOU KNOW, ISRAEL 

2249
01:07:21,670 --> 01:07:22,671
AND THE PALESTINIANS. 

2250
01:07:22,671 --> 01:07:23,906
EVERY POSSIBLE THING IS TOUGH 

2251
01:07:23,906 --> 01:07:24,206
ABOUT THAT. 

2252
01:07:24,206 --> 01:07:28,644
I THINK WE WILL MAKE A DEAL. 

2253
01:07:28,644 --> 01:07:29,811
SO, AT ONE OF OUR MANY MEETINGS 

2254
01:07:29,811 --> 01:07:37,019
TODAY I WAS WITH BENJAMIN 

2255
01:07:37,019 --> 01:07:37,419
NETANYAHU. 

2256
01:07:37,419 --> 01:07:39,121
HE'S BEEN EXTREMELY NICE TO ME 

2257
01:07:39,121 --> 01:07:42,191
AND VERY HAPPY I DID THE WHOLE 

2258
01:07:42,191 --> 01:07:44,260
THING WITH JERUSALEM AND THE 

2259
01:07:44,260 --> 01:07:44,627
EMBASSY. 

2260
01:07:44,627 --> 01:07:46,228
BY THE WAY, WE'VE GOT IT OPEN 

2261
01:07:46,228 --> 01:07:47,630
IN FOUR MONTHS FOR LESS THAN 

2262
01:07:47,630 --> 01:07:52,101
$500,000. 

2263
01:07:52,101 --> 01:07:53,235
THE BUDGET WAS OVER $1 BILLION, 

2264
01:07:53,235 --> 01:07:53,468
RIGHT? 

2265
01:07:53,468 --> 01:07:57,006
AND IT'S OPEN AND BEAUTIFUL, BY 

2266
01:07:57,006 --> 01:08:01,911
THE WAY. 

2267
01:08:01,911 --> 01:08:03,445
AND I WILL TELL YOU, SOMEONE 

2268
01:08:03,445 --> 01:08:04,813
SAID IT WAS THE FIRST NEWS 

2269
01:08:04,813 --> 01:08:06,849
CONFERENCE IN A LONG TIME AND I 

2270
01:08:06,849 --> 01:08:08,651
SAID, WHAT DO YOU MEAN? I 

2271
01:08:08,651 --> 01:08:09,551
DID FIVE TODAY. 

2272
01:08:09,551 --> 01:08:11,453
EVERY TIME I SAID I TAKE 

2273
01:08:11,453 --> 01:08:12,755
QUESTIONS FROM PEOPLE THAT ARE 

2274
01:08:12,755 --> 01:08:14,590
SCREAMING LIKE MANIACS IN THE 

2275
01:08:14,590 --> 01:08:15,824
BACK OF THE ROOM, MEANING 

2276
01:08:15,824 --> 01:08:16,892
REPORTERS AND ONE OF THEM, AND 

2277
01:08:16,892 --> 01:08:19,661
I WON'T SAY WAS JOHN ROBERTS, 

2278
01:08:19,661 --> 01:08:22,131
BUT ONE OF THEM -- IT WAS, BUT 

2279
01:08:22,131 --> 01:08:22,464
THAT'S OKAY. 

2280
01:08:22,464 --> 01:08:22,997
DON'T FEEL GUILTY, JOHN. 

2281
01:08:22,997 --> 01:08:24,500
ONE OF THE REPORTERS THAT WAS 

2282
01:08:24,500 --> 01:08:30,038
SCREAMING ASKED ABOUT THE ONE 

2283
01:08:30,038 --> 01:08:31,506
STATE-2 STATE AND I SAID, I 

2284
01:08:31,506 --> 01:08:32,474
THINK THE TWO STATE WILL 

2285
01:08:32,474 --> 01:08:33,475
HAPPEN. 

2286
01:08:33,475 --> 01:08:34,676
IN ONE WAY IT'S MORE DIFFICULT 

2287
01:08:34,676 --> 01:08:36,178
BECAUSE IT'S A REAL ESTATE DEAL 

2288
01:08:36,178 --> 01:08:39,682
AND YOU NEED BOUNDARIES AND 

2289
01:08:39,682 --> 01:08:46,755
CARVEOUTS AND OTHER THINGS. 

2290
01:08:46,755 --> 01:08:48,991
IT'S A TOUGHER DEAL BUT WORKS 

2291
01:08:48,991 --> 01:08:51,026
BETTER BECAUSE YOU HAVE PEOPLE 

2292
01:08:51,026 --> 01:08:51,493
GOVERNING THEMSELVES. 

2293
01:08:51,493 --> 01:08:53,796
THEY ASKED ME AND I SAID, I 

2294
01:08:53,796 --> 01:08:55,296
THINK THE TWO STATE WILL 

2295
01:08:55,296 --> 01:08:55,529
HAPPEN. 

2296
01:08:55,529 --> 01:08:58,901
I THINK WE ARE GOING TO GO DOWN 

2297
01:08:58,901 --> 01:09:01,237
THE TWO STATE ROAD AND I'M GLAD 

2298
01:09:01,237 --> 01:09:03,939
I GOT IT OUT. 

2299
01:09:03,939 --> 01:09:05,741
JARED, SO INVOLVED, HE LOVES 

2300
01:09:05,741 --> 01:09:08,344
ISRAEL BUT HE'S ALSO GOING TO 

2301
01:09:08,344 --> 01:09:09,545
BE FAIR WITH THE PALESTINIANS. 

2302
01:09:09,545 --> 01:09:11,212
HE UNDERSTANDS IT TAKES TWO 

2303
01:09:11,212 --> 01:09:13,048
GROUPS TO BE HAPPY. 

2304
01:09:13,048 --> 01:09:15,283
EVERYBODY HAS TO BE HAPPY AND 

2305
01:09:15,283 --> 01:09:17,019
THAT IS WHY IT'S SO TOUGH. 

2306
01:09:17,019 --> 01:09:19,755
THERE HAS BEEN SO MUCH HATRED 

2307
01:09:19,755 --> 01:09:21,189
AND ANGER FOR SO MANY YEARS AND 

2308
01:09:21,189 --> 01:09:23,392
THAT IS THE NUMBER ONE 

2309
01:09:23,392 --> 01:09:23,692
INGREDIENT. 

2310
01:09:23,692 --> 01:09:25,694
IF THEY ASKED ME, I THINK WILL 

2311
01:09:25,694 --> 01:09:26,362
BE A TWO STATE. 

2312
01:09:26,362 --> 01:09:28,930
BY SAYING THAT, I PUT IT OUT 

2313
01:09:28,930 --> 01:09:32,768
THERE AND IF YOU ASK MOST IN 

2314
01:09:32,768 --> 01:09:33,636
ISRAEL, THEY AGREE WITH THAT 

2315
01:09:33,636 --> 01:09:35,870
BUT NOBODY WANTED TO SAY IT. 

2316
01:09:35,870 --> 01:09:37,606
IT'S A BIG THING, A VERY BIG 

2317
01:09:37,606 --> 01:09:38,874
THING TO PUT IT OUT. 

2318
01:09:38,874 --> 01:09:43,212
THE BOTTOM LINE, IF THE 

2319
01:09:43,212 --> 01:09:44,446
ISRAELIS AND THE PALESTINIANS 

2320
01:09:44,446 --> 01:09:45,346
WANT ONE STATE, THAT'S OKAY 

2321
01:09:45,346 --> 01:09:45,747
WITH ME. 

2322
01:09:45,747 --> 01:09:47,283
IF THEY WANT TWO STATES, THAT'S 

2323
01:09:47,283 --> 01:09:53,455
OKAY WITH ME. 

2324
01:09:53,455 --> 01:09:55,957
I'M HAPPY IF THEY ARE HAPPY. 

2325
01:09:55,957 --> 01:09:58,127
I'M A FACILITATOR. 

2326
01:09:58,127 --> 01:09:59,828
I WANT A DEAL DONE SO PEOPLE 

2327
01:09:59,828 --> 01:10:00,996
DON'T GET KILLED ANYMORE. 

2328
01:10:00,996 --> 01:10:03,532
WE HAD A GREAT CONFERENCE IN 

2329
01:10:03,532 --> 01:10:05,367
HISTORY AND MANY WERE THERE, 

2330
01:10:05,367 --> 01:10:06,468
PROBABLY ALL OF YOU WERE THERE, 

2331
01:10:06,468 --> 01:10:07,836
ONE OF THE MOST BEAUTIFUL TWO 

2332
01:10:07,836 --> 01:10:09,004
DAYS. 

2333
01:10:09,004 --> 01:10:12,841
THAT AND CHINA, TWO OF THE MOST 

2334
01:10:12,841 --> 01:10:13,441
INCREDIBLE EVENTS I'VE SEEN. 

2335
01:10:13,441 --> 01:10:14,108
I'VE NEVER SEEN ANYTHING LIKE 

2336
01:10:14,108 --> 01:10:18,847
IT AND WE HAD 58 MUSLIM 

2337
01:10:18,847 --> 01:10:20,816
COUNTRIES, THE LEADERS, THE 

2338
01:10:20,816 --> 01:10:27,523
KINGS AND THE ABSOLUTE LEADERS. 

2339
01:10:27,523 --> 01:10:28,691
THERE WAS NOBODY IN SECOND 

2340
01:10:28,691 --> 01:10:28,924
PLACE. 

2341
01:10:28,924 --> 01:10:29,958
THEY WERE THE LEADERS OF THE 

2342
01:10:29,958 --> 01:10:33,161
WHOLE THING. 

2343
01:10:33,161 --> 01:10:35,664
UNBEKNOWNST TO ANYBODY ELSE, 

2344
01:10:35,664 --> 01:10:36,832
PEOPLE WOULD COME UP AND IT 

2345
01:10:36,832 --> 01:10:37,800
WASN'T A SET UP. 

2346
01:10:37,800 --> 01:10:39,368
THEY COME UP AND THEY'D SAY, 

2347
01:10:39,368 --> 01:10:41,036
SO, YOU CAN'T HAVE PEACE IN THE 

2348
01:10:41,036 --> 01:10:42,504
MIDDLE EAST WITHOUT PIECE 

2349
01:10:42,504 --> 01:10:49,778
BETWEEN THE ISRAELIS AND THE 

2350
01:10:49,778 --> 01:10:50,979
PALESTINIANS AND I SAID, WHY 

2351
01:10:50,979 --> 01:10:53,382
DOES THAT MATTER SO MUCH? 

2352
01:10:53,382 --> 01:10:54,550
THEY SAID, IT'S IMPOSSIBLE TO 

2353
01:10:54,550 --> 01:10:55,851
MAKE PEACE IN THE MIDDLE EAST 

2354
01:10:55,851 --> 01:10:57,219
UNLESS YOU HAVE IT BETWEEN THE 

2355
01:10:57,219 --> 01:10:59,121
ISRAELIS. 

2356
01:10:59,121 --> 01:11:00,589
I HEARD THAT FROM THE KING OF 

2357
01:11:00,589 --> 01:11:04,893
SAUDI ARABIA, A GREAT GUY, KING 

2358
01:11:04,893 --> 01:11:05,159
SOLOMON. 

2359
01:11:05,159 --> 01:11:06,662
SOMEBODY ELSE CAME UP AND HE 

2360
01:11:06,662 --> 01:11:07,630
WASN'T TOLD TO GO SAY THIS. 

2361
01:11:07,630 --> 01:11:08,964
I KNOW WHERE THEY ARE COMING 

2362
01:11:08,964 --> 01:11:10,299
FROM AND I MUST'VE HAD 12 

2363
01:11:10,299 --> 01:11:17,005
LEADERS SAY IT AND THEY JUST 

2364
01:11:17,005 --> 01:11:19,942
SAID IT AND I STARTED TO REALIZE

2365
01:11:19,942 --> 01:11:21,043
THAT PEACE BETWEEN ISRAEL AND 

2366
01:11:21,043 --> 01:11:22,745
THE PALESTINIANS FOR THE MIDDLE 

2367
01:11:22,745 --> 01:11:24,880
EAST IS A VERY IMPORTANT THING 

2368
01:11:24,880 --> 01:11:27,283
AND WE ARE TRYING VERY HARD TO 

2369
01:11:27,283 --> 01:11:27,516
GET IT. 

2370
01:11:27,516 --> 01:11:29,017
PROBABLY TWO STATE IS MORE 

2371
01:11:29,017 --> 01:11:31,253
LIKELY BUT IF THEY DO A SINGLE 

2372
01:11:31,253 --> 01:11:32,921
OR A DOUBLE, I'M OKAY IF THEY 

2373
01:11:32,921 --> 01:11:33,756
ARE BOTH HAPPY. 

2374
01:11:33,756 --> 01:11:35,324
IF THEY ARE BOTH HAPPY, I'M 

2375
01:11:35,324 --> 01:11:35,857
OKAY WITH EITHER. 

2376
01:11:35,857 --> 01:11:41,029
I THINK THE TWO STATE IS MORE 

2377
01:11:41,029 --> 01:11:41,663
LIKELY. 

2378
01:11:41,663 --> 01:11:42,598
>> NEW YORK TIMES? 

2379
01:11:42,598 --> 01:11:43,832
>> OKAY. 

2380
01:11:43,832 --> 01:11:44,733
>> THANK YOU, SIR. 

2381
01:11:44,733 --> 01:11:47,369
>> I WOULD HAVE GOTTEN A BAD 

2382
01:11:47,369 --> 01:11:48,604
STORY IN THE NEW YORK TIMES, 

2383
01:11:48,604 --> 01:11:49,872
BUT I WILL ANYWAY. 

2384
01:11:49,872 --> 01:11:52,073
I GUESS IT DOESN'T MATTER. 

2385
01:11:52,073 --> 01:11:54,276
THEN, WE WILL CALL IT QUITS. 

2386
01:11:54,276 --> 01:11:55,811
>> WE ARE THRIVING, NOT 

2387
01:11:55,811 --> 01:11:56,078
FAILING. 

2388
01:11:56,078 --> 01:11:57,379
>> YOU ARE DOING VERY WELL. 

2389
01:11:57,379 --> 01:11:59,481
SAY THANK YOU, MR. TRUMP. 

2390
01:11:59,481 --> 01:12:01,216
>> I WILL STOP SHORT OF THAT. 

2391
01:12:01,216 --> 01:12:03,519
>> ALL MY LIFE I'VE HAD VERY 

2392
01:12:03,519 --> 01:12:04,720
STEW -- VERY FEW STORIES BUT 

2393
01:12:04,720 --> 01:12:06,088
SOME ON THE FRONT PAGE OF THE 

2394
01:12:06,088 --> 01:12:07,322
NEW YORK TIMES AND NOW I 

2395
01:12:07,322 --> 01:12:08,523
AVERAGE THREE OR FOUR A DAY. 

2396
01:12:08,523 --> 01:12:10,326
THEY ARE ALL NEGATIVE, NO 

2397
01:12:10,326 --> 01:12:12,394
MATTER WHAT I DO THEY ARE 

2398
01:12:12,394 --> 01:12:12,661
NEGATIVE. 

2399
01:12:12,661 --> 01:12:13,295
YOU KNOW WHAT? 

2400
01:12:13,295 --> 01:12:14,296
THAT'S OKAY. I 

2401
01:12:14,296 --> 01:12:15,330
STILL OF THE PAPER. 

2402
01:12:15,330 --> 01:12:16,231
GO AHEAD. 

2403
01:12:16,231 --> 01:12:18,566
>> I WANT TO COME BACK TO 

2404
01:12:18,566 --> 01:12:19,501
CHINA. 

2405
01:12:19,501 --> 01:12:22,004
WHAT YOU ANNOUNCED TODAY IS 

2406
01:12:22,004 --> 01:12:22,404
REALLY IMPORTANT. 

2407
01:12:22,404 --> 01:12:24,273
YOU TALK ABOUT THIS FRIENDSHIP 

2408
01:12:24,273 --> 01:12:25,940
YOU HAVE WITH XI JINPING AND 

2409
01:12:25,940 --> 01:12:29,578
YET, ESSENTIALLY, WHAT YOU DID 

2410
01:12:29,578 --> 01:12:31,113
TODAY IS ACCUSED HIS GOVERNMENT 

2411
01:12:31,113 --> 01:12:32,815
OF INTERFERING IN OUR INTERNAL 

2412
01:12:32,815 --> 01:12:34,283
AFFAIRS, AVERTING THE 

2413
01:12:34,283 --> 01:12:36,051
DEMOCRATIC PROCESS AND DOING IT 

2414
01:12:36,051 --> 01:12:37,252
TO HURT YOU, THE REPUBLICAN 

2415
01:12:37,252 --> 01:12:39,822
PARTY -- >> DOING IT TO HELP 

2416
01:12:39,822 --> 01:12:40,022
THEM. 

2417
01:12:40,022 --> 01:12:42,725
>> HOW CAN A GUY WHO DOES THAT 

2418
01:12:42,725 --> 01:12:43,192
BE YOUR FRIEND? 

2419
01:12:43,192 --> 01:12:46,028
>> I THINK THAT WE ARE ABLE TO 

2420
01:12:46,028 --> 01:12:46,428
 

2421
01:12:46,428 --> 01:12:48,831
WILL BE HONEST WITH YOU. I 

2422
01:12:48,831 --> 01:12:51,266
THINK WE HAD A VERY GOOD 

2423
01:12:51,266 --> 01:12:51,566
FRIENDSHIP. 

2424
01:12:51,566 --> 01:12:52,935
WE HAD A GOOD RELATIONSHIP AND 

2425
01:12:52,935 --> 01:12:54,102
WE UNDERSTAND EACH OTHER. 

2426
01:12:54,102 --> 01:12:55,804
THEY ARE DOING STUDIES ON 

2427
01:12:55,804 --> 01:12:57,940
DONALD TRUMP TO FIGURE IT ALL 

2428
01:12:57,940 --> 01:12:58,140
OUT. 

2429
01:12:58,140 --> 01:12:59,407
THIS HAS NEVER HAPPENED TO THEM 

2430
01:12:59,407 --> 01:13:02,711
BEFORE. 

2431
01:13:02,711 --> 01:13:04,613
THINK OF IT. 

2432
01:13:04,613 --> 01:13:05,447
YOU'VE COVERED IT VERY WELL. 

2433
01:13:05,447 --> 01:13:07,349
YOU'VE NEVER SEEN THIS HAPPEN. 

2434
01:13:07,349 --> 01:13:08,417
THEY ARE HAVING BIG PROBLEMS 

2435
01:13:08,417 --> 01:13:09,718
AND I DON'T WANT THEM TO HAVE 

2436
01:13:09,718 --> 01:13:09,985
PROBLEMS. 

2437
01:13:09,985 --> 01:13:11,253
THEY HAVE TO MAKE A FAIR DEAL 

2438
01:13:11,253 --> 01:13:12,654
JUST LIKE CANADA HAS TO MAKE A 

2439
01:13:12,654 --> 01:13:12,954
FAIR DEAL. 

2440
01:13:12,954 --> 01:13:16,124
I BELIEVE THAT HE AND I HAVE A 

2441
01:13:16,124 --> 01:13:16,925
VERY GOOD CHEMISTRY TOGETHER. 

2442
01:13:16,925 --> 01:13:19,061
I CAN TELL YOU THAT ABOUT MANY 

2443
01:13:19,061 --> 01:13:21,730
LEADERS AND I CAN ALSO TELL YOU 

2444
01:13:21,730 --> 01:13:23,398
THAT I DON'T FEEL I WOULD HAVE 

2445
01:13:23,398 --> 01:13:24,600
A CHEMISTRY WITH SOME AND FOR 

2446
01:13:24,600 --> 01:13:25,400
THOSE PEOPLE I HAVE MIKE POMPEO 

2447
01:13:25,400 --> 01:13:32,241
AND NIKKI AND BOLTON AND IF 

2448
01:13:32,241 --> 01:13:33,542
THEY CAN'T DO IT I WILL HAVE 

2449
01:13:33,542 --> 01:13:34,977
SARAH HUCKABEE DO IT. 

2450
01:13:34,977 --> 01:13:37,079
FOR THE MOST PART, VERY GOOD 

2451
01:13:37,079 --> 01:13:45,020
WITH PRIME MINISTER ABE AND 

2452
01:13:45,020 --> 01:13:46,688
PRESIDENT MOON, AND I KNOW YOU 

2453
01:13:46,688 --> 01:13:47,890
WON'T REPORT IT, BUT BRET BAIER 

2454
01:13:47,890 --> 01:13:49,424
INTERVIEWED HIM LAST NIGHT. 

2455
01:13:49,424 --> 01:13:55,464
I CAN'T SAY IT BECAUSE YOU 

2456
01:13:55,464 --> 01:13:56,331
WOULD SAY I'M TOO BRAGGADOCIOUS 

2457
01:13:56,331 --> 01:13:57,666
BUT WHAT HE SAID ABOUT ME LAST 

2458
01:13:57,666 --> 01:13:58,867
NIGHT WAS AN UNBELIEVABLE 

2459
01:13:58,867 --> 01:14:03,305
THING. 

2460
01:14:03,305 --> 01:14:04,373
IT COULDN'T HAVE HAPPENED 

2461
01:14:04,373 --> 01:14:05,140
WITHOUT PRESIDENT TRUMP AND 

2462
01:14:05,140 --> 01:14:05,841
NEVER WOULD HAPPEN WITHOUT 

2463
01:14:05,841 --> 01:14:06,775
PRESIDENT TRUMP AND NOBODY ELSE 

2464
01:14:06,775 --> 01:14:07,476
-- TAKE A LOOK. 

2465
01:14:07,476 --> 01:14:15,651
I WILL TELL YOU THAT CHINA IS 

2466
01:14:15,651 --> 01:14:17,419
VERY SPECIAL, VERY SPECIAL. 

2467
01:14:17,419 --> 01:14:20,622
THEY ARE INCREDIBLE PEOPLE, AND 

2468
01:14:20,622 --> 01:14:21,890
INCREDIBLE COUNTRY AND WHAT 

2469
01:14:21,890 --> 01:14:23,859
THEY'VE DONE IS UNBELIEVABLE. 

2470
01:14:23,859 --> 01:14:25,494
IT ALL STARTED WITH A DEFECTIVE 

2471
01:14:25,494 --> 01:14:26,194
DEAL. 

2472
01:14:26,194 --> 01:14:27,429
WITHOUT THE WTO, CHINA IS NOT 

2473
01:14:27,429 --> 01:14:29,031
CHINA AS WE KNOW IT TODAY AND 

2474
01:14:29,031 --> 01:14:31,600
IT STARTED ALSO WITH OUR PEOPLE 

2475
01:14:31,600 --> 01:14:32,834
THAT ARE STANDING RIGHT IN THIS 

2476
01:14:32,834 --> 01:14:35,103
POSITION IN THE OVERALL OFFICE, 

2477
01:14:35,103 --> 01:14:37,005
ALLOWING THEM TO GET AWAY WITH 

2478
01:14:37,005 --> 01:14:42,578
MURDER. 

2479
01:14:42,578 --> 01:14:44,980
WE STILL HAVE A VERY GOOD 

2480
01:14:44,980 --> 01:14:48,917
RELATIONSHIP. 

2481
01:14:48,917 --> 01:14:50,852
IN HONOR OF YOU, I WILL MAKE A 

2482
01:14:50,852 --> 01:14:52,921
CALL AND SAY, HOW ARE YOU 

2483
01:14:52,921 --> 01:14:54,423
DOING? 

2484
01:14:54,423 --> 01:14:57,025
I DON'T MIND PAYING BILLIONS OF 

2485
01:14:57,025 --> 01:14:59,394
DOLLARS A MONTH. 

2486
01:14:59,394 --> 01:15:01,095
>> THE LEVEL OF INTERFERENCE 

2487
01:15:01,095 --> 01:15:02,397
YOU SEE TODAY FROM THE CHINESE 

2488
01:15:02,397 --> 01:15:07,069
TO WHAT RUSSIA DID IN 2016, CAN 

2489
01:15:07,069 --> 01:15:07,536
YOU COMPARE THERE? 

2490
01:15:07,536 --> 01:15:08,436
>> I THINK IT'S DIFFERENT. 

2491
01:15:08,436 --> 01:15:09,671
IF YOU LOOK AT THE DES MOINES 

2492
01:15:09,671 --> 01:15:14,843
REGISTER, THEY HAVE ADS THAT 

2493
01:15:14,843 --> 01:15:17,312
ARE MADE TO LOOK LIKE 

2494
01:15:17,312 --> 01:15:18,614
EDITORIALS, SAYING YOU HAVE TO 

2495
01:15:18,614 --> 01:15:19,781
STOP TRUMP, YOU'VE GOT TO VOTE 

2496
01:15:19,781 --> 01:15:20,616
AGAINST HIM. 

2497
01:15:20,616 --> 01:15:24,653
THESE ARE PATRIOTS. 

2498
01:15:24,653 --> 01:15:26,088
ON A NETWORK THAT DOESN'T LIKE 

2499
01:15:26,088 --> 01:15:27,756
ME VERY MUCH, WHICH IS MOST OF 

2500
01:15:27,756 --> 01:15:30,125
THEM, A NETWORK THAT DOESN'T 

2501
01:15:30,125 --> 01:15:32,928
REALLY TREAT ME VERY GOOD, THE 

2502
01:15:32,928 --> 01:15:33,428
INTERVIEWED FARMERS. 

2503
01:15:33,428 --> 01:15:35,364
THEY GOT HURT BECAUSE ALL OF A 

2504
01:15:35,364 --> 01:15:43,205
SUDDEN CHINA STOPPED BUYING. 

2505
01:15:43,205 --> 01:15:44,239
I DON'T KNOW IF YOU'VE NOTICED 

2506
01:15:44,239 --> 01:15:45,974
BUT THEY ARE BUYING AGAIN AND 

2507
01:15:45,974 --> 01:15:47,976
THINGS ARE GOING OUT. 

2508
01:15:47,976 --> 01:15:49,011
THERE'S VERY LITTLE HURT FROM 

2509
01:15:49,011 --> 01:15:50,812
WHAT I'VE DONE. 

2510
01:15:50,812 --> 01:15:53,015
IN FACT, THE MARKETS HAVE GONE 

2511
01:15:53,015 --> 01:15:56,018
UP AND FARMERS WILL DO GREAT, 

2512
01:15:56,018 --> 01:15:56,385
ULTIMATELY. 

2513
01:15:56,385 --> 01:15:58,253
THEY HAD FARMERS IN THESE GUYS 

2514
01:15:58,253 --> 01:15:58,921
ARE AMAZING. I 

2515
01:15:58,921 --> 01:16:00,121
LOVED THEM AND THEY VOTED FOR 

2516
01:16:00,121 --> 01:16:00,656
ME. 

2517
01:16:00,656 --> 01:16:04,560
THEY SAID, WE DON'T CARE IF WE 

2518
01:16:04,560 --> 01:16:04,826
GET HURT. 

2519
01:16:04,826 --> 01:16:06,628
HE'S DOING THE RIGHT THING. 

2520
01:16:06,628 --> 01:16:09,364
YOU KNOW, IT'S A COMPLEX GAME. 

2521
01:16:09,364 --> 01:16:10,732
A LOT OF PEOPLE DON'T KNOW 

2522
01:16:10,732 --> 01:16:12,334
EXACTLY WHAT IT IS OR HOW TO 

2523
01:16:12,334 --> 01:16:14,636
DEFINE TARIFF AND THEY DON'T 

2524
01:16:14,636 --> 01:16:16,505
KNOW IF IT'S DIFFERENT THAN 

2525
01:16:16,505 --> 01:16:18,507
TAXES, BUT IT'S GETTING CLOSE 

2526
01:16:18,507 --> 01:16:20,175
AND THEY KNOW THAT FOR THE 

2527
01:16:20,175 --> 01:16:21,610
FIRST TIME IN MANY, MANY YEARS, 

2528
01:16:21,610 --> 01:16:22,343
THEY HAVE A PRESIDENT THAT'S 

2529
01:16:22,343 --> 01:16:28,250
FIGHTING FOR THEM. 

2530
01:16:28,250 --> 01:16:29,284
THAT ISN'T LETTING THEIR JOBS 

2531
01:16:29,284 --> 01:16:30,552
BE TAKEN TO OTHER COUNTRIES AND 

2532
01:16:30,552 --> 01:16:31,653
THAT'S NOT ALLOWING THE KIND OF 

2533
01:16:31,653 --> 01:16:33,321
ABUSE -- WHEN YOU LOOK AT WHAT 

2534
01:16:33,321 --> 01:16:38,894
HAPPENED AS AN EXAMPLE WITH 

2535
01:16:38,894 --> 01:16:41,029
NAFTA -- AND IT WAS NEVER 

2536
01:16:41,029 --> 01:16:41,563
CHANGED FOUR YEARS. 

2537
01:16:41,563 --> 01:16:43,799
NAFTA WAS DEFECTIVE THE DAY IT 

2538
01:16:43,799 --> 01:16:45,500
WAS SIGNED BECAUSE THEY HAD A 

2539
01:16:45,500 --> 01:16:47,703
TAX OF 17% AND NOBODY FROM THIS 

2540
01:16:47,703 --> 01:16:48,870
COUNTRY KNEW THAT AND BY THE 

2541
01:16:48,870 --> 01:16:51,373
TIME THEY FOUND OUT A WEAK 

2542
01:16:51,373 --> 01:16:54,275
LATER, NOBODY WENT TO CHANGE 

2543
01:16:54,275 --> 01:16:55,477
IT. 

2544
01:16:55,477 --> 01:16:58,246
HE WENT MANY YEARS AND THEY 

2545
01:16:58,246 --> 01:16:58,679
NEVER CHANGED IT. 

2546
01:16:58,679 --> 01:17:01,950
THERE WAS A VAT TAX THAT MEXICO 

2547
01:17:01,950 --> 01:17:02,150
GOT. 

2548
01:17:02,150 --> 01:17:05,454
WE WERE 17 POINTS OR 16 POINTS 

2549
01:17:05,454 --> 01:17:08,323
BEHIND BEFORE WE EVER STARTED. 

2550
01:17:08,323 --> 01:17:09,090
NAFTA WAS A HORRIBLE THING. 

2551
01:17:09,090 --> 01:17:09,825
THE FARMERS AND THE 

2552
01:17:09,825 --> 01:17:10,992
STEELWORKERS -- I STOPPED THE 

2553
01:17:10,992 --> 01:17:14,362
DUMPING. THE DUMPING WAS 

2554
01:17:14,362 --> 01:17:16,464
HORRIBLE AND NOW IF THEY WANT 

2555
01:17:16,464 --> 01:17:18,834
TO DUMP, THAT'S OKAY BUT THEY 

2556
01:17:18,834 --> 01:17:21,803
HAVE TO PAY THE U.S. 25% ON 

2557
01:17:21,803 --> 01:17:22,403
EVERYTHING THEY DUMPED. 

2558
01:17:22,403 --> 01:17:23,905
THAT'S OKAY. 

2559
01:17:23,905 --> 01:17:27,442
AS I STROLLED YOU, -- AS I TOLD 

2560
01:17:27,442 --> 01:17:29,010
YOU, STEEL IS DOING 

2561
01:17:29,010 --> 01:17:29,443
PHENOMENALLY WELL. 

2562
01:17:29,443 --> 01:17:32,180
NO PRESIDENT HAS EVER FOUGHT 

2563
01:17:32,180 --> 01:17:33,849
FOR US BEFORE AND YOU HAVE TO 

2564
01:17:33,849 --> 01:17:36,952
STUDY WHAT HAPPENED OVER THE 15 

2565
01:17:36,952 --> 01:17:37,185
YEARS. 

2566
01:17:37,185 --> 01:17:38,353
FARMERS HAVE BEEN DECIMATED 

2567
01:17:38,353 --> 01:17:40,155
OVER A 15-YEAR PERIOD. 

2568
01:17:40,155 --> 01:17:40,922
THEY'VE BEEN DECIMATED AND 

2569
01:17:40,922 --> 01:17:42,724
FARMERS WILL COME OUT GREAT. 

2570
01:17:42,724 --> 01:17:44,760
THESE ARE GREAT PEOPLE, GREAT 

2571
01:17:44,760 --> 01:17:46,428
PATRIOTS AND I THINK WE SHOULD 

2572
01:17:46,428 --> 01:17:47,095
FINISH WITH THAT ONE. 

2573
01:17:47,095 --> 01:17:48,030
IS THAT OKAY? 

2574
01:17:48,030 --> 01:17:49,030
GO AHEAD. 

2575
01:17:49,030 --> 01:17:49,297
LET'S GO. 

2576
01:17:49,297 --> 01:17:53,034
FAST. 

2577
01:17:53,034 --> 01:17:54,870
I ALWAYS LIKE TO FINISH WITH A 

2578
01:17:54,870 --> 01:17:55,137
GOOD ONE. 

2579
01:17:55,137 --> 01:17:56,271
ELTON JOHN SAID, WHEN YOU HIT 

2580
01:17:56,271 --> 01:17:57,673
THAT LAST TUNE AND IT'S GOOD, 

2581
01:17:57,673 --> 01:18:01,209
DON'T GO BACK. 

2582
01:18:01,209 --> 01:18:02,878
HAVE YOU EVER SEEN? 

2583
01:18:02,878 --> 01:18:03,511
THEY DO GREAT. 

2584
01:18:03,511 --> 01:18:04,980
THEY HIT THE LAST ONE AND 

2585
01:18:04,980 --> 01:18:06,481
EVERYONE GOES CRAZY AND THEN 

2586
01:18:06,481 --> 01:18:07,782
THEY GO BACK FOR THE ENCORE, 

2587
01:18:07,782 --> 01:18:08,016
RIGHT? 

2588
01:18:08,016 --> 01:18:10,252
AND THEY DON'T HIT IT AND THEY 

2589
01:18:10,252 --> 01:18:12,320
LEAVE AND EVERYONE LEAVES AND 

2590
01:18:12,320 --> 01:18:14,456
THEY SAY, THAT WASN'T A VERY 

2591
01:18:14,456 --> 01:18:15,290
GOOD CONCERT, WAS IT? 

2592
01:18:15,290 --> 01:18:15,557
LET'S GO. 

2593
01:18:15,557 --> 01:18:16,124
DON'T MAKE ME WRONG. 

2594
01:18:16,124 --> 01:18:18,226
>> AHEAD OF THE HEARING 

2595
01:18:18,226 --> 01:18:22,731
TOMORROW, YOU WERE ASKED EARLIER

2596
01:18:22,731 --> 01:18:24,933
ABOUT THE MESSAGE THAT YOU ARE 

2597
01:18:24,933 --> 01:18:26,101
SENDING TO THE WOMEN OF THE 

2598
01:18:26,101 --> 01:18:26,368
COUNTRY. 

2599
01:18:26,368 --> 01:18:27,803
WHAT ABOUT THE MESSAGE THAT YOU 

2600
01:18:27,803 --> 01:18:31,173
MAY BE SENDING TWO YOUNG MEN? 

2601
01:18:31,173 --> 01:18:32,840
YOU ARE A FATHER. 

2602
01:18:32,840 --> 01:18:34,943
WHAT DOES THIS MOMENT WE ARE 

2603
01:18:34,943 --> 01:18:36,077
IN, THE CULTURAL MOMENT -- 

2604
01:18:36,077 --> 01:18:38,213
>> IT'S A VERY BIG CULTURAL 

2605
01:18:38,213 --> 01:18:38,847
MOMENT. 

2606
01:18:38,847 --> 01:18:39,214
>> RIGHT. 

2607
01:18:39,214 --> 01:18:41,016
WHAT MESSAGE ARE YOU GOING TO 

2608
01:18:41,016 --> 01:18:41,216
SEND? 

2609
01:18:41,216 --> 01:18:42,450
>> I THINK IT'S A GREAT 

2610
01:18:42,450 --> 01:18:42,717
QUESTION. 

2611
01:18:42,717 --> 01:18:44,085
IT'S A VERY BIG MOMENT FOR OUR 

2612
01:18:44,085 --> 01:18:48,890
COUNTRY BECAUSE YOU HAVE A MAN 

2613
01:18:48,890 --> 01:18:49,991
WHOSE VERY OUTSTANDING BUT HE 

2614
01:18:49,991 --> 01:18:51,193
HAS VERY STRONG CHARGES AGAINST 

2615
01:18:51,193 --> 01:18:51,393
HIM. 

2616
01:18:51,393 --> 01:18:56,798
PROBABLY CHARGES THAT NOBODY IS 

2617
01:18:56,798 --> 01:18:58,800
GOING TO BE ABLE TO PROVE. 

2618
01:18:58,800 --> 01:19:02,137
SO, I COULD HAVE YOU CHOSEN FOR 

2619
01:19:02,137 --> 01:19:03,705
A POSITION OR I COULD HAVE YOU 

2620
01:19:03,705 --> 01:19:07,509
OR YOU COULD -- ANYBODY -- AND 

2621
01:19:07,509 --> 01:19:08,676
SOMEBODY COULD SAY -- AND IS 

2622
01:19:08,676 --> 01:19:09,610
HAPPENED TO ME MANY TIMES. 

2623
01:19:09,610 --> 01:19:17,953
FALSE STATEMENTS ARE MADE. 

2624
01:19:17,953 --> 01:19:19,421
HONESTLY, NOBODY KNOWS WHO TO 

2625
01:19:19,421 --> 01:19:19,788
BELIEVE. 

2626
01:19:19,788 --> 01:19:21,189
I COULD PICK ANOTHER SUPREME 

2627
01:19:21,189 --> 01:19:23,191
COURT JUDGE, JUSTICE, I COULD 

2628
01:19:23,191 --> 01:19:24,392
PICK ANOTHER ONE AND ANOTHER 

2629
01:19:24,392 --> 01:19:26,260
ONE AND THIS COULD GO ON 

2630
01:19:26,260 --> 01:19:26,527
FOREVER. 

2631
01:19:26,527 --> 01:19:28,697
SOMEBODY COULD COME AND SAY 30 

2632
01:19:28,697 --> 01:19:31,333
YEARS AGO, 25 YEARS AGO, 10 

2633
01:19:31,333 --> 01:19:34,369
YEARS AGO, FIVE YEARS AGO, HE 

2634
01:19:34,369 --> 01:19:35,370
DID A HORRIBLE THING TO ME. 

2635
01:19:35,370 --> 01:19:37,506
HE DID THIS OR THAT. 

2636
01:19:37,506 --> 01:19:38,840
HONESTLY, IT'S A VERY DANGEROUS 

2637
01:19:38,840 --> 01:19:39,841
PERIOD IN OUR COUNTRY. 

2638
01:19:39,841 --> 01:19:46,781
IT'S BEING PERPETRATED BY SOME 

2639
01:19:46,781 --> 01:19:47,849
VERY EVIL PEOPLE. 

2640
01:19:47,849 --> 01:19:50,552
SOME OF THEM ARE DEMOCRATS, I 

2641
01:19:50,552 --> 01:19:52,020
MUST SAY. 

2642
01:19:52,020 --> 01:19:53,822
BECAUSE, SOME OF THEM KNOW THAT 

2643
01:19:53,822 --> 01:19:57,025
THIS IS JUST A GAME THAT THEY 

2644
01:19:57,025 --> 01:19:58,092
ARE PLAYING. 

2645
01:19:58,092 --> 01:20:00,729
IT'S A CON GAME AT THE HIGHEST 

2646
01:20:00,729 --> 01:20:00,962
LEVEL. 

2647
01:20:00,962 --> 01:20:02,697
WE ARE TALKING ABOUT THE UNITED 

2648
01:20:02,697 --> 01:20:03,164
STATES SUPREME COURT. 

2649
01:20:03,164 --> 01:20:05,367
THIS CAN GO ON FOREVER. 

2650
01:20:05,367 --> 01:20:07,202
I COULD PICK FIVE OTHER PEOPLE. 

2651
01:20:07,202 --> 01:20:09,571
AT A CERTAIN POINT PEOPLE WILL 

2652
01:20:09,571 --> 01:20:10,071
SAY NO THANKFUL. 

2653
01:20:10,071 --> 01:20:12,974
THIS IS THE MOST COVETED JOB, 

2654
01:20:12,974 --> 01:20:14,242
PROBABLY, IN THE WORLD. 

2655
01:20:14,242 --> 01:20:16,478
YOU KNOW WHAT? 

2656
01:20:16,478 --> 01:20:18,280
I WOULD HONESTLY SAY -- I 

2657
01:20:18,280 --> 01:20:20,148
INTERVIEWED GREAT PEOPLE FOR 

2658
01:20:20,148 --> 01:20:21,983
THIS JOB -- HE'S GREAT. 

2659
01:20:21,983 --> 01:20:22,717
I INTERVIEWED OTHER GREAT 

2660
01:20:22,717 --> 01:20:23,451
PEOPLE FOR THIS JOB. 

2661
01:20:23,451 --> 01:20:26,655
I COULD CONCEIVABLY IMAGINE 

2662
01:20:26,655 --> 01:20:27,722
GOING TO ONE OF THEM AND 

2663
01:20:27,722 --> 01:20:29,024
SAYING, IT'S TOO BAD WHAT 

2664
01:20:29,024 --> 01:20:34,763
HAPPENED TO THIS WONDERFUL MAN. 

2665
01:20:34,763 --> 01:20:38,300
BUT, I'M GOING TO CHOOSE YOU, 

2666
01:20:38,300 --> 01:20:39,200
NUMBER TWO. I 

2667
01:20:39,200 --> 01:20:39,600
WANT YOU TO GO. 

2668
01:20:39,600 --> 01:20:40,502
I COULD CONCEIVABLY BE TURNED 

2669
01:20:40,502 --> 01:20:41,436
DOWN BY SOMEBODY THAT 

2670
01:20:41,436 --> 01:20:45,006
DESPERATELY WANTED THIS JOB TWO 

2671
01:20:45,006 --> 01:20:49,744
MONTHS AGO. 

2672
01:20:49,744 --> 01:20:52,146
SO, THIS IS BEYOND SUPREME 

2673
01:20:52,146 --> 01:20:52,380
COURT. 

2674
01:20:52,380 --> 01:20:53,782
THERE'S NOTHING BEYOND SUPREME 

2675
01:20:53,782 --> 01:20:54,249
COURT. 

2676
01:20:54,249 --> 01:20:55,283
THIS IS BEYOND SUPREME COURT. 

2677
01:20:55,283 --> 01:20:56,150
THIS IS EVERYTHING TO DO WITH 

2678
01:20:56,150 --> 01:20:57,018
OUR COUNTRY. 

2679
01:20:57,018 --> 01:21:03,024
WHEN YOU ARE GUILTY UNTIL PROVEN

2680
01:21:03,024 --> 01:21:04,192
INNOCENT, IT'S JUST NOT 

2681
01:21:04,192 --> 01:21:05,126
SUPPOSED TO BE THAT WAY. 

2682
01:21:05,126 --> 01:21:06,027
ALWAYS, I HEARD, YOU ARE 

2683
01:21:06,027 --> 01:21:11,132
INNOCENT UNTIL PROVEN GUILTY. 

2684
01:21:11,132 --> 01:21:12,934
I'VE HEARD IT FOR SO LONG AND 

2685
01:21:12,934 --> 01:21:13,901
IT'S A SUCH A PHRASE. 

2686
01:21:13,901 --> 01:21:15,870
IN THIS CASE, YOU ARE GUILTY 

2687
01:21:15,870 --> 01:21:19,507
UNTIL PROVEN INNOCENT. 

2688
01:21:19,507 --> 01:21:22,644
I THINK THAT IS A VERY, VERY 

2689
01:21:22,644 --> 01:21:23,778
DANGEROUS STANDARD FOR OUR 

2690
01:21:23,778 --> 01:21:24,045
COUNTRY. 

2691
01:21:24,045 --> 01:21:26,982
WITH THAT BEING SAID, I LOOK 

2692
01:21:26,982 --> 01:21:29,050
FORWARD TO WHAT SHE HAS TO SAY. 

2693
01:21:29,050 --> 01:21:30,051
I ALSO LOOK VERY FORWARD TO 

2694
01:21:30,051 --> 01:21:30,986
WHAT JUDGE KAVANAUGH HAS TO 

2695
01:21:30,986 --> 01:21:31,186
SAY. 

2696
01:21:31,186 --> 01:21:35,957
I THINK IT'S GOING TO BE A 

2697
01:21:35,957 --> 01:21:37,559
VERY, VERY IMPORTANT DAY IN THE 

2698
01:21:37,559 --> 01:21:39,360
HISTORY OF OUR COUNTRY. 

2699
01:21:39,360 --> 01:21:41,096
I WANT TO THANK YOU ALL. 

2700
01:21:41,096 --> 01:21:42,797
WE WILL DO IT AGAIN. 

2701
01:21:42,797 --> 01:21:46,134
>> YOUR MESSAGE TO YOUNG MEN? 

2702
01:21:46,134 --> 01:21:47,102
NOTHING TO SAY, SIR? 

2703
01:21:47,102 --> 01:21:47,669
>> PLEASE, LADIES AND 

2704
01:21:47,669 --> 01:21:49,004
GENTLEMEN, REMAIN SEATED AS OUR 

2705
01:21:49,004 --> 01:21:53,441
DELEGATION DEPARTS. 

2706
01:21:53,441 --> 01:21:57,512
>>> I MET ELAINE CANO AND YOU'VE

2707
01:21:57,512 --> 01:21:58,513
BEEN LISTENING TO PRESIDENT 

2708
01:21:58,513 --> 01:21:59,447
TRUMP SPEAK IN NEW YORK

KAVANAUGH DENIES THE 

2722
01:22:20,935 --> 01:22:21,836
ALLEGATIONS AGAINST HIM. 

2723
01:22:21,836 --> 01:22:22,704

01:22:24,706 --> 01:22:27,208
BIG FAT CON JOB BY DEMOCRATS.

2728
01:22:30,612 --> 01:22:33,048

HUEY-BURNS AND JULIE RENDLEMAN. 

2735
01:22:46,461 --> 01:22:50,965

01:22:50,965 --> 01:22:53,568

LET'S GET RIGHT TO IT. 

2744
01:23:01,709 --> 01:23:02,944
PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP SAID HE 

2745
01:23:02,944 --> 01:23:06,815
WAS CONFIDENT, CAITLIN, HIS 

2746
01:23:06,815 --> 01:23:08,850
SUPREME COURT NOMINEE WILL GET 

2747
01:23:08,850 --> 01:23:10,552
ENOUGH VOTES TO BE CONFIRMED 

2748
01:23:10,552 --> 01:23:12,019
EVEN FROM SOME DEMOCRATS. 

2749
01:23:12,019 --> 01:23:14,289
TWO PEOPLE ON CAPITOL HILL THINK

2750
01:23:14,289 --> 01:23:14,489
THAT? 

2751
01:23:14,489 --> 01:23:16,791
>> PEOPLE ON CAPITOL HILL ARE 

2752
01:23:16,791 --> 01:23:18,092
WAITING TO SEE WHAT HAPPENS 

2753
01:23:18,092 --> 01:23:20,195
TOMORROW AND WHAT FORD SAYS 

2754
01:23:20,195 --> 01:23:22,430
UNDER OATH IN HER TESTIMONY. 

2755
01:23:22,430 --> 01:23:23,297
AND, WHAT KAVANAUGH SAYS. 

2756
01:23:23,297 --> 01:23:25,467
YOU HAVE TO CONSIDER A COUPLE 

2757
01:23:25,467 --> 01:23:28,103
OF THINGS WITH THE BACKDROP TO 

2758
01:23:28,103 --> 01:23:28,870
THE PRESS CONFERENCE. 

2759
01:23:28,870 --> 01:23:32,407
IT RAN ABOUT ONE HOUR 20 MINUTES

2760
01:23:32,407 --> 01:23:32,607
LONG. 

2761
01:23:32,607 --> 01:23:34,976
THE PRESIDENT HAS BEEN WATCHING 

2762
01:23:34,976 --> 01:23:37,378
NEWS COVERAGE FOR THE PAST 

2763
01:23:37,378 --> 01:23:39,213
WEEK, ALL FOCUSED ON KAVANAUGH 

2764
01:23:39,213 --> 01:23:40,014
AND THESE ACCUSATIONS. I 

2765
01:23:40,014 --> 01:23:41,349
THINK THE QUESTION WEIJIA JIANG 

2766
01:23:41,349 --> 01:23:44,185
BROUGHT UP WAS REALLY 

2767
01:23:44,185 --> 01:23:44,719
SIGNIFICANT TO GET THE 

2768
01:23:44,719 --> 01:23:47,355
PRESIDENTS WORLDVIEW ON THIS. 

2769
01:23:47,355 --> 01:23:51,226
THE PRESIDENT, HIMSELF, HAS MANY

2770
01:23:51,226 --> 01:23:52,927
ACCUSATIONS OF SEXUAL ASSAULT 

2771
01:23:52,927 --> 01:23:54,629
AGAINST HIM AND WHETHER THAT 

2772
01:23:54,629 --> 01:23:55,663
INFORMS HIS OWN VIEW ABOUT 

2773
01:23:55,663 --> 01:23:55,963
KAVANAUGH. 

2774
01:23:55,963 --> 01:23:59,467
HE ACKNOWLEDGED THAT, IN FACT, 

2775
01:23:59,467 --> 01:24:01,836
IT DOES. 

2776
01:24:01,836 --> 01:24:04,205
THIS IS THE PRESIDENT NOT ONLY 

2777
01:24:04,205 --> 01:24:04,939
DIGGING IN TERMS OF DEFENDING 

2778
01:24:04,939 --> 01:24:05,773
BRETT KAVANAUGH, BUT REALLY 

2779
01:24:05,773 --> 01:24:07,008
VENTING A BIT ABOUT THE PROCESS 

2780
01:24:07,008 --> 01:24:14,349
AND WHAT HE THINKS IS AN UNFAIR 

2781
01:24:14,349 --> 01:24:14,616
PROCESS. 

2782
01:24:14,616 --> 01:24:18,586
HE SEEMED TO BE IN A LIGHT MOOD 

2783
01:24:18,586 --> 01:24:19,954
AFTER HE KIND OF GOT THAT OUT 

2784
01:24:19,954 --> 01:24:20,989
THERE, CONTINUING TO TAKE 

2785
01:24:20,989 --> 01:24:21,956
QUESTIONS FROM MEMBERS OF THE 

2786
01:24:21,956 --> 01:24:26,961
PRESS AND ENGAGING ON A VARIETY 

2787
01:24:26,961 --> 01:24:29,197
OF FRONTS AND FLOODING THE ZONE 

2788
01:24:29,197 --> 01:24:30,231
WITH INFORMATION. 

2789
01:24:30,231 --> 01:24:32,800
PERHAPS TO PROVIDE MORE THINGS 

2790
01:24:32,800 --> 01:24:35,170
TO TALK ABOUT, BUT, REALLY, HIS 

2791
01:24:35,170 --> 01:24:36,571
DEFENSE OF KAVANAUGH SEEMS 

2792
01:24:36,571 --> 01:24:37,505
PRETTY STRONG AT THIS POINT. 

2793
01:24:37,505 --> 01:24:38,673
HE ALSO SAID, WE WILL SEE WHAT 

2794
01:24:38,673 --> 01:24:39,573
HAPPENS TOMORROW. 

2795
01:24:39,573 --> 01:24:45,013
>> LET'S GO TO MOLLY ON CAPITOL 

2796
01:24:45,013 --> 01:24:45,480
HILL. 

2797
01:24:45,480 --> 01:24:47,382
DID YOU GET ANY KIND OF 

2798
01:24:47,382 --> 01:24:49,117
REACTION REAL TIME AS THE NEWS 

2799
01:24:49,117 --> 01:24:50,885
CONFERENCE WAS HAPPENING? 

2800
01:24:50,885 --> 01:24:54,189
IF SO, WHAT ARE PEOPLE SAYING? I

2801
01:24:54,189 --> 01:24:56,958
WOULD ASK YOU THE SAME THING. 

2802
01:24:56,958 --> 01:24:58,426
OF A CONFIDENT KAVANAUGH CAN 

2803
01:24:58,426 --> 01:24:59,427
GET CONFIRMED? 

2804
01:24:59,427 --> 01:25:01,029
>> Reporter: I WILL CHANNEL MY 

2805
01:25:01,029 --> 01:25:02,997
INNER JEFF FLAKE, WHO ACTUALLY 

2806
01:25:02,997 --> 01:25:04,064
SPOKE TO BRIEFLY EARLIER TODAY. 

2807
01:25:04,064 --> 01:25:06,367
HE WAS IN A HURRY. 

2808
01:25:06,367 --> 01:25:08,036
THE PRESIDENT REITERATED THINGS 

2809
01:25:08,036 --> 01:25:09,203
HE SAID BEFORE BUT THIS MORNING 

2810
01:25:09,203 --> 01:25:11,206
HE WAS INTERESTING WHEN HE SAID 

2811
01:25:11,206 --> 01:25:12,474
I THINK THE REPUBLICANS ON 

2812
01:25:12,474 --> 01:25:13,908
CAPITOL HILL HAVE BEEN TOO 

2813
01:25:13,908 --> 01:25:14,108
NICE. 

2814
01:25:14,108 --> 01:25:16,844
THEY SHOULD HAVE VOTED ON THIS 

2815
01:25:16,844 --> 01:25:17,277
SEVERAL WEEKS AGO. 

2816
01:25:17,277 --> 01:25:20,114
IF IT WAS ME I WOULD'VE DONE IT 

2817
01:25:20,114 --> 01:25:20,448
QUICKER. 

2818
01:25:20,448 --> 01:25:22,183
THEY'VE BEEN TOO AN ICE AND 

2819
01:25:22,183 --> 01:25:24,852
JEFF FLAKE SAID, HE GOES, WELL, 

2820
01:25:24,852 --> 01:25:26,087
THIS IS THE SENATE AND WE ARE 

2821
01:25:26,087 --> 01:25:29,090
NOT THE WHITE HOUSE. 

2822
01:25:29,090 --> 01:25:31,826
YOU KNOW, MAKING THE POINT THAT 

2823
01:25:31,826 --> 01:25:33,595
IT IS MORE COLLEGIAL AND 

2824
01:25:33,595 --> 01:25:35,062
CORDIAL AND THAT IS SOMETHING 

2825
01:25:35,062 --> 01:25:37,131
THAT GRASSLEY WAS HEARING 

2826
01:25:37,131 --> 01:25:39,167
DURING THE ONE-DAY LUNCH. 

2827
01:25:39,167 --> 01:25:41,803
FROM WHAT I UNDERSTAND, THE 

2828
01:25:41,803 --> 01:25:44,105
POINT THAT REPUBLICANS HAD GONE 

2829
01:25:44,105 --> 01:25:46,741
ABOVE AND BEYOND TRYING TO GET 

2830
01:25:46,741 --> 01:25:48,910
THESE WITNESSES AND ACCUSERS 

2831
01:25:48,910 --> 01:25:50,778
AND ALLEGATIONS -- THE PEOPLE 

2832
01:25:50,778 --> 01:25:52,080
BEHIND THE ALLEGATIONS -- TO 

2833
01:25:52,080 --> 01:25:53,381
TESTIFY AND THERE WAS A 

2834
01:25:53,381 --> 01:25:55,650
POSSIBILITY THAT THE SENATE 

2835
01:25:55,650 --> 01:25:57,285
JUDICIARY COULD HEAR FROM THE 

2836
01:25:57,285 --> 01:25:58,987
MOST RECENT WOMAN WHO CAME OUT 

2837
01:25:58,987 --> 01:25:59,387
WITH ALLEGATIONS. 

2838
01:25:59,387 --> 01:26:03,491
BUT, THAT REMAINS TO BE SEEN. 

2839
01:26:03,491 --> 01:26:04,759
UP ON CAPITOL HILL, THEY SORT 

2840
01:26:04,759 --> 01:26:05,859
OF FEEL LIKE REPUBLICANS ARE 

2841
01:26:05,859 --> 01:26:11,132
FEELING LIKE THE MORE THAT 

2842
01:26:11,132 --> 01:26:12,400
COMES OUT, THERE IS A QUESTION 

2843
01:26:12,400 --> 01:26:13,368
FROM WHAT I UNDERSTAND FROM ONE 

2844
01:26:13,368 --> 01:26:18,506
OR TWO REPUBLICANS THAT THIS MAY

2845
01:26:18,506 --> 01:26:19,840
BE COORDINATED BETWEEN 

2846
01:26:19,840 --> 01:26:20,909
DEMOCRATS BECAUSE THEY POINT TO 

2847
01:26:20,909 --> 01:26:21,643
SENATOR FEINSTEIN HAVING HELD 

2848
01:26:21,643 --> 01:26:23,011
ONTO THAT INFORMATION FOR SO 

2849
01:26:23,011 --> 01:26:28,916
LONG BEFORE SHE SENT IT TO THE 

2850
01:26:28,916 --> 01:26:31,986
FBI TO MAKE IT MORE PUBLIC AND 

2851
01:26:31,986 --> 01:26:32,921
TO GET THE INVESTIGATION. 

2852
01:26:32,921 --> 01:26:33,788
>> JULIE, WE HAVE CHRISTINE 

2853
01:26:33,788 --> 01:26:34,288
BLASEY FORD'S PREPARED 

2854
01:26:34,288 --> 01:26:35,823
TESTIMONY AHEAD OF THE HEARING 

2855
01:26:35,823 --> 01:26:37,859
ON THURSDAY AND I WANT TO READ 

2856
01:26:37,859 --> 01:26:38,192
SOME OF THAT. 

2857
01:26:38,192 --> 01:26:40,995
PEOPLE MAY NOT OF HAD A CHANCE 

2858
01:26:40,995 --> 01:26:42,963
TO TAKE A LOOK AT THAT. 

2859
01:26:42,963 --> 01:26:44,899
THIS IS ON THE THIRD PAGE. 

2860
01:26:44,899 --> 01:26:46,067
THERE WAS MUSIC ALREADY PLAYING 

2861
01:26:46,067 --> 01:26:46,500
IN THE BEDROOM. 

2862
01:26:46,500 --> 01:26:48,603
IT WAS TURNED UP LOUD OR BY 

2863
01:26:48,603 --> 01:26:49,937
EITHER BRETT OR MARK WHEN WE 

2864
01:26:49,937 --> 01:26:51,706
WERE IN THE ROOM. 

2865
01:26:51,706 --> 01:26:53,441
I WAS PUSHED ONTO THE BED AND 

2866
01:26:53,441 --> 01:26:55,977
BRETT GOT ON TOP OF ME AND 

2867
01:26:55,977 --> 01:26:58,146
BEGAN RUNNING HIS HANDS OVER MY 

2868
01:26:58,146 --> 01:26:59,513
BODY AND GRINDING HIS HIPS INTO 

2869
01:26:59,513 --> 01:27:00,114
ME. I 

2870
01:27:00,114 --> 01:27:01,316
YELLED, HOPING SOMEONE DOWN 

2871
01:27:01,316 --> 01:27:02,283
STAIRS MIGHT HEAR ME. 

2872
01:27:02,283 --> 01:27:04,752
I TRIED TO GET AWAY BUT HIS 

2873
01:27:04,752 --> 01:27:05,185
WEIGHT WAS HEAVY. 

2874
01:27:05,185 --> 01:27:07,021
HE GRABBED ME AND TRY TO TAKE 

2875
01:27:07,021 --> 01:27:07,922
OFF MY CLOTHING. 

2876
01:27:07,922 --> 01:27:11,392
HE HAD A HARD TIME BECAUSE HE 

2877
01:27:11,392 --> 01:27:11,692
WAS DRUNK. 

2878
01:27:11,692 --> 01:27:12,927
I WORE A ONE-PIECE BATHING SUIT 

2879
01:27:12,927 --> 01:27:14,529
UNDER MY CLOTHING. I 

2880
01:27:14,529 --> 01:27:16,597
WAS BELIEVING HE WAS TRYING TO 

2881
01:27:16,597 --> 01:27:17,097
RAPE ME. 

2882
01:27:17,097 --> 01:27:19,434
HE PUT HIS HAND OVER MY MOUTH 

2883
01:27:19,434 --> 01:27:20,868
TO STOP ME FROM SCREAMING AND 

2884
01:27:20,868 --> 01:27:22,070
THIS TERRIFIED ME THE MOST AND 

2885
01:27:22,070 --> 01:27:23,805
HAD THE MOST LASTING IMPACT ON 

2886
01:27:23,805 --> 01:27:24,072
MY LIFE. 

2887
01:27:24,072 --> 01:27:26,374
IT WAS HARD FOR ME TO BREATHE 

2888
01:27:26,374 --> 01:27:28,209
AND I THOUGHT THAT BRETT WAS 

2889
01:27:28,209 --> 01:27:29,744
ACCIDENTALLY GOING TO KILL ME. 

2890
01:27:29,744 --> 01:27:31,179
BOTH BRETT AND MARK WERE 

2891
01:27:31,179 --> 01:27:33,047
DRUNKENLY LAUGHING DURING THE 

2892
01:27:33,047 --> 01:27:34,983
ATTACK AND THEY BOTH SEEMED TO 

2893
01:27:34,983 --> 01:27:36,584
BE HAVING A GOOD TIME. 

2894
01:27:36,584 --> 01:27:38,486
MARCH WAS -- MARK WAS URGING 

2895
01:27:38,486 --> 01:27:39,854
BRETT ON ALTHOUGH HE TOLD HIM 

2896
01:27:39,854 --> 01:27:41,022
TO STOP AT TIMES. 

2897
01:27:41,022 --> 01:27:43,024
I MADE EYE CONTACT WITH MARK 

2898
01:27:43,024 --> 01:27:45,026
AND THOUGHT HE MIGHT TRY TO 

2899
01:27:45,026 --> 01:27:47,294
HELP ME BUT HE DID NOT. 

2900
01:27:47,294 --> 01:27:49,030
TO REMIND PEOPLE, THOSE ARE THE 

2901
01:27:49,030 --> 01:27:50,732
RECOLLECTIONS OF A WOMAN WHO 

2902
01:27:50,732 --> 01:27:53,034
SAID THIS IS WHAT HAPPENED TO 

2903
01:27:53,034 --> 01:27:54,802
HER AT THE AGE OF 15. 

2904
01:27:54,802 --> 01:27:57,271
IT WAS AT THE TIME BRETT 

2905
01:27:57,271 --> 01:27:59,440
KAVANAUGH WAS 17 YEARS OLD. 

2906
01:27:59,440 --> 01:28:03,044
IS A PROSECUTOR WHO IS 

2907
01:28:03,044 --> 01:28:04,112
PROSECUTED SEX CRIMES, WOULD IT 

2908
01:28:04,112 --> 01:28:06,347
BE UNUSUAL FOR SOMEONE OF THAT 

2909
01:28:06,347 --> 01:28:08,116
AGE TO NOT NECESSARILY REPORT 

2910
01:28:08,116 --> 01:28:10,752
TO AUTHORITIES IN A TIMELY WAY? 

2911
01:28:10,752 --> 01:28:11,219
>> ABSOLUTELY NOT. 

2912
01:28:11,219 --> 01:28:14,288
WE SEE THAT TODAY AND WE SEE IT 

2913
01:28:14,288 --> 01:28:16,491
NOW MORE BECAUSE OF THE #METOO 

2914
01:28:16,491 --> 01:28:17,358
MOVEMENT WITH HARVEY WEINSTEIN 

2915
01:28:17,358 --> 01:28:25,933
AND WITH BILL COSBY AND WE SEE 

2916
01:28:25,933 --> 01:28:26,901
IT WITH THE CATHOLIC CHURCH IN 

2917
01:28:26,901 --> 01:28:28,369
WHICH YOUNG MEN CAME FORWARD 

2918
01:28:28,369 --> 01:28:30,270
YEARS LATER, EITHER TOO SCARED 

2919
01:28:30,270 --> 01:28:31,572
TO COME FORWARD OR THEY DIDN'T 

2920
01:28:31,572 --> 01:28:32,439
TELL CLOSE FAMILY MEMBERS. 

2921
01:28:32,439 --> 01:28:33,641
IT'S NOT UNUSUAL AT ALL AND 

2922
01:28:33,641 --> 01:28:34,409
THIS COMPLAINANT OR THIS 

2923
01:28:34,409 --> 01:28:35,410
VICTIM, HAS TO BE TREATED LIKE 

2924
01:28:35,410 --> 01:28:36,911
ANY OTHER VICTIM, WHETHER AN 

2925
01:28:36,911 --> 01:28:39,180
INDIVIDUAL CAME FORWARD OR THEY 

2926
01:28:39,180 --> 01:28:40,214
CAME FORWARD OR THE EVENT 

2927
01:28:40,214 --> 01:28:41,416
HAPPENED 30 YEARS AGO, ARE THEY 

2928
01:28:41,416 --> 01:28:45,052
CREDIBLE AND ABLE TO BE 

2929
01:28:45,052 --> 01:28:46,954
COLLABORATED? 

2930
01:28:46,954 --> 01:28:49,189
-- ABLE TO BE CORROBORATED? 

2931
01:28:49,189 --> 01:28:51,292
IT'S MORE DIFFICULT TO TESTIFY 

2932
01:28:51,292 --> 01:28:51,959
ABOUT SOMETHING THAT HAPPENED 

2933
01:28:51,959 --> 01:28:52,794
35 YEARS AGO. 

2934
01:28:52,794 --> 01:28:54,762
THAT IS WHY SOMEONE AT MY 

2935
01:28:54,762 --> 01:28:56,764
VANTAGE POINT AND MOST OF US 

2936
01:28:56,764 --> 01:28:57,965
THINK, WHY IS THERE NOT MORE 

2937
01:28:57,965 --> 01:28:59,901
THAN INVESTIGATION TO SEE IF 

2938
01:28:59,901 --> 01:29:01,469
THERE ARE OTHER WITNESSES THAT 

2939
01:29:01,469 --> 01:29:02,970
CAN CORROBORATE AND SUPPORT 

2940
01:29:02,970 --> 01:29:04,505
WHAT SHE HAS TO SAY, OR SAY 

2941
01:29:04,505 --> 01:29:05,839
THAT SHE IS NOT TELLING THE 

2942
01:29:05,839 --> 01:29:06,073
TRUTH. 

2943
01:29:06,073 --> 01:29:09,210
HOW DOES THAT HURT THE PROCESS 

2944
01:29:09,210 --> 01:29:10,778
TO HAVE PEOPLE KNOW MORE ABOUT 

2945
01:29:10,778 --> 01:29:13,213
WHAT THEY ARE DEALING WITH? 

2946
01:29:13,213 --> 01:29:16,217
>> JULIE, WE'VE SEEN A LETTER 

2947
01:29:16,217 --> 01:29:18,252
FROM CHRISTINE BLASEY FORD'S 

2948
01:29:18,252 --> 01:29:19,887
LAWYERS THAT DETAILS THE 

2949
01:29:19,887 --> 01:29:21,422
POLYGRAPH REPORT THAT WE ARE 

2950
01:29:21,422 --> 01:29:22,023
SHOWING. 

2951
01:29:22,023 --> 01:29:24,826
THE IMAGES ARE FROM WHEN THE 

2952
01:29:24,826 --> 01:29:25,293
POLYGRAPH WAS TAKEN. 

2953
01:29:25,293 --> 01:29:27,194
IT'S NOT A TRIAL ON THURSDAY. 

2954
01:29:27,194 --> 01:29:28,763
HOW SIGNIFICANT OR RELIABLE 

2955
01:29:28,763 --> 01:29:31,866
WITH THE LIE DETECTOR TEST BE 

2956
01:29:31,866 --> 01:29:32,733
IN A SITUATION LIKE THIS? 

2957
01:29:32,733 --> 01:29:34,302
>> WE DON'T ALLOW THEM IN 

2958
01:29:34,302 --> 01:29:38,539
CRIMINAL PROCEEDINGS BECAUSE 

2959
01:29:38,539 --> 01:29:40,141
THERE IS NO GUARANTEE OF 

2960
01:29:40,141 --> 01:29:42,143
CERTAINTY THAT THEY WORK. 

2961
01:29:42,143 --> 01:29:43,578
IT'S USED AS AN INVESTIGATIVE 

2962
01:29:43,578 --> 01:29:45,813
TECHNIQUE WHEN IT COMES TO THEM 

2963
01:29:45,813 --> 01:29:47,982
TRYING TO GET A WITNESS TO BE 

2964
01:29:47,982 --> 01:29:48,382
MORE FORTHCOMING. 

2965
01:29:48,382 --> 01:29:49,684
THERE IS SOMETHING TO BE SAID 

2966
01:29:49,684 --> 01:29:50,785
FOR AN INDIVIDUAL WILLING TO 

2967
01:29:50,785 --> 01:29:52,854
TAKE A LIE DETECTOR TEST 

2968
01:29:52,854 --> 01:29:54,188
BECAUSE IF YOU ARE WILLING TO 

2969
01:29:54,188 --> 01:29:55,590
TAKE IT, IT INDICATES YOU HAVE 

2970
01:29:55,590 --> 01:29:57,825
NOTHING TO HIDE. 

2971
01:29:57,825 --> 01:29:59,227
IT MAY WAY ON INDIVIDUALS THAT 

2972
01:29:59,227 --> 01:30:06,601
SHE WAS WILLING TO HAVE THIS 

2973
01:30:06,601 --> 01:30:06,901
TEST TAKEN. 

2974
01:30:06,901 --> 01:30:08,969
>> THE PRESIDENT COMMENTED ON 

2975
01:30:08,969 --> 01:30:09,770
WHETHER HE COULD CHANGE HIS 

2976
01:30:09,770 --> 01:30:11,506
MIND ABOUT JUDGE KAVANAUGH. 

2977
01:30:11,506 --> 01:30:11,839
LET'S LISTEN. 

2978
01:30:11,839 --> 01:30:13,007
>> I DON'T THINK PEOPLE ARE 

2979
01:30:13,007 --> 01:30:13,908
RELUCTANT TO COME FORWARD. 

2980
01:30:13,908 --> 01:30:14,675
THEY HAVE A CHANCE TO SPEAK 

2981
01:30:14,675 --> 01:30:18,212
WITH A MAJOR CHANCE TO SPEAK. 

2982
01:30:18,212 --> 01:30:18,512
EXCUSE ME. 

2983
01:30:18,512 --> 01:30:19,846
THEY HAVE A MAJOR CHANCE TO 

2984
01:30:19,846 --> 00:00:00,000
SPEAK.
