00:00:00,149 --> 00:00:06,950
When Jurassic Park first came out in 1993,
it was a pretty groundbreaking depiction of dinosaurs.

2
00:00:06,950 --> 00:00:11,889
Steven Spielberg certainly took plenty of
artistic liberties, but overall,

3
00:00:11,889 --> 00:00:15,809
the movie was so much better than what had
come before, in terms of recreating what scientists

4
00:00:15,809 --> 00:00:18,209
knew about how dinosaurs looked and how they
moved.

5
00:00:20,279 --> 00:00:22,470
The character Alan Grant was actually a bit
ahead of his time.

6
00:00:22,470 --> 00:00:29,470
“Look at the half-moon shaped bones in the
wrists. No wonder these guys learned how to

7
00:00:29,470 --> 00:00:32,500
fly…Seriously!”
Back then, the claim that birds evolved from

8
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:35,820
dinosaurs was still controversial. Now it’s
widely accepted.

9
00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:39,980
But in the late 1990s, the science started
speeding ahead and the movies just didn’t

10
00:00:39,980 --> 00:00:42,930
keep up.
Even the latest installment, Jurassic World,

11
00:00:42,930 --> 00:00:48,590
shot in ultra high-definition 3D -- it features
dinosaurs that are out of date.

12
00:00:53,870 --> 00:00:58,110
Three years after the first Jurassic Park
movie was released, scientists in China uncovered

13
00:00:58,110 --> 00:01:04,599
a feathered dinosaur for the first time -- Sinosauropteryx.
It takes very specific conditions for the

14
00:01:04,599 --> 00:01:09,150
earth to record soft tissues like these primitive
feathers. The animals had to buried quickly,

15
00:01:09,150 --> 00:01:15,190
before decomposing, in fine-grained sediment.
It turned out that this part of China, Liaoning

16
00:01:15,190 --> 00:01:20,470
Province, saw major volcanic eruptions around
120 million years ago, which provided these

17
00:01:20,470 --> 00:01:23,820
very conditions.
And more than 30 feathered dinosaur species

18
00:01:23,820 --> 00:01:28,750
have been unearthed there and in some other
places since 1996.

19
00:01:28,750 --> 00:01:32,930
These fuzzy dinosaurs were mostly 2-legged
meat eaters, part of a group that’s closely

20
00:01:32,930 --> 00:01:37,170
related to birds in the dinosaur family tree.
That group includes many of the dinosaurs

21
00:01:37,170 --> 00:01:42,890
featured in the Jurassic Park movies. “Gallimimus”
These guys probably had feathers of some sort

22
00:01:42,890 --> 00:01:47,580
for insulation or decoration. And that includes
the raptors.

23
00:01:47,580 --> 00:01:51,900
Jurassic Park III sort of nodded to the new
research by giving them a little bit of a

24
00:01:51,900 --> 00:01:54,620
hairdo. But their feathers probably looked
more like this.

25
00:01:54,620 --> 00:02:00,560
A velociraptor fossil from the Gobi desert
revealed bumps on the forearm similar to the

26
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:04,979
wing attachments on modern birds. That means
raptors had wings.

27
00:02:04,979 --> 00:02:10,258
And what about T-Rex? There’s no direct
evidence, but a few years ago, scientists

28
00:02:10,258 --> 00:02:15,209
found a 30-foot dinosaur with some feathers
- the biggest so far. Yutyrannus is thought

29
00:02:15,209 --> 00:02:20,599
to be closely related to T-Rex, so it’s
possible that the most famous and feared dinosaur

30
00:02:20,599 --> 00:02:22,430
might have been sorta fluffy.

31
00:02:22,460 --> 00:02:27,840
It’s not clear how universal feathers were
among dinosaurs. But while most of the specimens

32
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:32,060
are theropods, there have been a few
interesting findings from way over on the other

33
00:02:32,060 --> 00:02:33,760
side of the family tree.

34
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:37,769
These two have bristles of some sort, which
may or may not be related to bird feathers.

35
00:02:37,769 --> 00:02:43,919
And this one, found last year, has even more
complex feather-like filaments. These fossils

36
00:02:43,919 --> 00:02:48,120
may indicate that feather precursors date
back to some of the dinosaurs’ earliest

37
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:52,169
common ancestors.
Jurassic World could have introduced feathered

38
00:02:52,169 --> 00:02:56,840
dinosaurs to a huge audience this year. But
it didn’t.

39
00:02:56,840 --> 00:03:01,230
According to Jack Horner, a paleontologist
that worked on all four films, the decision

40
00:03:01,230 --> 00:03:06,109
was made for the sake of consistency.
But you have to assume they also just weren’t

41
00:03:06,109 --> 00:00:00,000
up for the task of making feathers…into
something scary.
