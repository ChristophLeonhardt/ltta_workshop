1
00:00:00,156 --> 00:00:03,226
FIRST, THE ANATOMY OF A SMEAR.

2
00:00:03,226 --> 00:00:04,694
THAT'S THE SUBJECT OF TONIGHT'S

3
00:00:04,694 --> 00:00:10,833
"ANGLE."

4
00:00:10,833 --> 00:00:13,870
TODAY'S LEFT LEANING MEDIA

5
00:00:13,870 --> 00:00:15,505
COMPLEX FANCY THEMSELVES AS THE

6
00:00:15,505 --> 00:00:17,507
ONLY RELIABLE CHECK ON THE

7
00:00:17,507 --> 00:00:18,107
PRESIDENT.

8
00:00:18,107 --> 00:00:20,743
SURE, CONGRESSIONAL DEMOCRATS

9
00:00:20,743 --> 00:00:23,346
CAN GIVE SPEECHES AND FILE

10
00:00:23,346 --> 00:00:25,081
MINORITY REPORTS ON CAPITOL HILL

11
00:00:25,081 --> 00:00:27,917
AND BOB MUELLER MAY BE GETTING

12
00:00:27,917 --> 00:00:28,251
WARMER.

13
00:00:28,251 --> 00:00:31,487
BUT THE PRESS BELIEVES IT HAS A

14
00:00:31,487 --> 00:00:33,589
SUPERIOR MORAL RESPONSIBILITY

15
00:00:33,589 --> 00:00:36,626
NOT NECESSARILY TO RESPECT THE

16
00:00:36,626 --> 00:00:38,361
TRUTH BUT TO REPORT A VERSION OF

17
00:00:38,361 --> 00:00:40,229
THE TRUTH IN A WAY THAT IS

18
00:00:40,229 --> 00:00:42,131
SKEWED AGAINST TRUMP AND HIS

19
00:00:42,131 --> 00:00:43,166
ALLIES.

20
00:00:43,166 --> 00:00:46,369
HENCE, THEY TAKE A COMMENT ABOUT

21
00:00:46,369 --> 00:00:49,572
HIM ABOUT MS-13 MEMBERS.

22
00:00:49,572 --> 00:00:54,510
>> MS-13 GANG MEMBERS.

23
00:00:54,510 --> 00:00:55,745
>> WE HAVE PEOPLE COMING INTO

24
00:00:55,745 --> 00:00:57,647
THE COUNTRY OR TRYING TO COME

25
00:00:57,647 --> 00:00:59,115
IN, WE ARE STOPPING A LOT OF

26
00:00:59,115 --> 00:00:59,449
THEM.

27
00:00:59,449 --> 00:01:01,184
WE ARE TAKING PEOPLE OUT OF THE

28
00:01:01,184 --> 00:01:01,684
COUNTRY.

29
00:01:01,684 --> 00:01:03,152
YOU WOULD NOT BELIEVE HOW BAD

30
00:01:03,152 --> 00:01:04,787
THESE PEOPLE ARE.

31
00:01:04,787 --> 00:01:05,922
THESE ARE NOT PEOPLE.

32
00:01:05,922 --> 00:01:08,491
THESE ARE ANIMALS.

33
00:01:08,491 --> 00:01:10,026
>> Laura: AND THEY TURN THAT

34
00:01:10,026 --> 00:01:14,764
COMMENT INTO THIS:

35
00:01:14,764 --> 00:01:18,701
TRUMP RANT ON UNAUTHORIZED

36
00:01:18,701 --> 00:01:19,569
MIGRANTS.

37
00:01:19,569 --> 00:01:22,538
THESE ARE ANIMALS SAID THE "NEW

38
00:01:22,538 --> 00:01:25,675
YORK TIMES."

39
00:01:25,675 --> 00:01:32,448
AND THE NEW YORK DAILY NEWS.

40
00:01:32,448 --> 00:01:38,921
AND THE HUFFINGTON POST

41
00:01:38,921 --> 00:01:39,622
SQUAWKED:

42
00:01:39,622 --> 00:01:42,225
NOW THIS IS AN OBSCENE AND

43
00:01:42,225 --> 00:01:44,660
RIDICULOUS AND FRANKLY NEFARIOUS

44
00:01:44,660 --> 00:01:47,563
PLAN THAT GETS PICKED UP BY

45
00:01:47,563 --> 00:01:49,932
LIBERAL POLITICIANS LIKE CHUCK

46
00:01:49,932 --> 00:01:53,269
SCHUMER WHO WROTE THE FOLLOWING:

47
00:01:53,269 --> 00:01:55,271
WHEN ALL OF OUR GREAT, GREAT

48
00:01:55,271 --> 00:01:56,772
GRANDPARENTS CAME TO AMERICA,

49
00:01:56,772 --> 00:01:58,174
THEY WERE NOT ANIMALS AND THESE

50
00:01:58,174 --> 00:02:00,610
PEOPLE WERE NOT EITHER.

51
00:02:00,610 --> 00:02:02,812
ON TV THEY BOUNCE CONDEMNATIONS

52
00:02:02,812 --> 00:02:05,348
AROUND THE ECHO CHAMBER.

53
00:02:05,348 --> 00:02:10,186
>> WHAT DID THE PRESIDENT MEAN

54
00:02:10,186 --> 00:02:12,488
WHEN HE SAID IMMIGRANTS ARE

55
00:02:12,488 --> 00:02:12,822
ANIMALS?

56
00:02:12,822 --> 00:02:15,324
>> IT'S A DISGUSTING WAY TO TALK

57
00:02:15,324 --> 00:02:16,392
ABOUT HUMAN BEINGS.

58
00:02:16,392 --> 00:02:18,161
>> IT'S A SLIPPERY SLOPE WHEN

59
00:02:18,161 --> 00:02:21,697
YOU DEHUMANIZE PEOPLE.

60
00:02:21,697 --> 00:02:25,134
THAT'S WHAT THE NAZIS AND SLAVE

61
00:02:25,134 --> 00:02:25,835
OWNERS DID.

62
00:02:25,835 --> 00:02:27,803
IT'S NOT WHAT AMERICANS DID.

63
00:02:27,803 --> 00:02:30,139
>> THE TONE SHIFTED ABOUT WHAT

64
00:02:30,139 --> 00:02:35,011
IT MEANS IF YOU ARE AN ILLEGAL

65
00:02:35,011 --> 00:02:35,378
IMMIGRANT.

66
00:02:35,378 --> 00:02:37,780
>> Laura: YES, SHE WENT TO

67
00:02:37,780 --> 00:02:38,080
NAZIS.

68
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:40,216
OH MY GOD, DO ANY OF THESE

69
00:02:40,216 --> 00:02:42,084
PEOPLE BOTHER TO TRY TO LOOK

70
00:02:42,084 --> 00:02:45,688
LIKE THEY ARE IN ANY WAY

71
00:02:45,688 --> 00:02:47,456
IMPARTIAL, CALLING BALLS AND

72
00:02:47,456 --> 00:02:47,790
STRIKES?

73
00:02:47,790 --> 00:02:50,426
YOU KNOW, LEARN THE FACTS OR

74
00:02:50,426 --> 00:02:53,362
UNDERSTAND WHAT THE CONTEXT OF

75
00:02:53,362 --> 00:02:57,066
THE PRESIDENT SAID OR GET OUT OF

76
00:02:57,066 --> 00:03:00,570
THE BUSINESS!

77
00:03:00,703 --> 00:03:03,206
TO READ BEYOND THE HEADLINES AND

78
00:03:03,206 --> 00:03:04,674
REPORT THE TRUTH.

79
00:03:04,674 --> 00:03:07,443
EVEN ANALYSTS, BOTHER TO READ

80
00:03:07,443 --> 00:03:10,079
THE FULL COMMENTS AND BE FAIR!

81
00:03:10,079 --> 00:03:13,583
SPEAKING OF BEING FAIR, JAKE

82
00:03:13,583 --> 00:03:15,384
TAPPER AND CNN THEY DID NOTE

83
00:03:15,384 --> 00:03:16,686
THAT THE PRESIDENT WAS TAKEN OUT

84
00:03:16,686 --> 00:03:21,123
OF CONTEXT EARLIER TODAY AND THE

85
00:03:21,123 --> 00:03:29,165
AP AKNOWLEDGED IT MADE AN HONOR

86
00:03:29,165 --> 00:03:29,532
MISTAKE.

87
00:03:29,532 --> 00:03:33,469
THEY DELETED A TWEET ABOUT

88
00:03:33,469 --> 00:03:37,006
TRUMP'S COMMENTS ABOUT

89
00:03:37,006 --> 00:03:37,840
IMMIGRANTS BECAUSE IT WAS NOT

90
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:41,644
MADE CLEAR IT WAS A COMMENT

91
00:03:41,644 --> 00:03:43,746
ABOUT GANG MEMBERS.

92
00:03:43,746 --> 00:03:46,249
EVEN AFTER THOSE CLARIFICATIONS

93
00:03:46,249 --> 00:03:47,850
MSNBC COULD NOT HELP ITSELF.

94
00:03:47,850 --> 00:03:49,986
>> PRESIDENT TRUMP LASHING OUT

95
00:03:49,986 --> 00:03:51,787
AND STIRRING CONTROVERSY OVER

96
00:03:51,787 --> 00:03:53,823
HIS HARSH RECORD TOWARDS

97
00:03:53,823 --> 00:03:57,159
IMMIGRANTS BRANDING THEM

98
00:03:57,159 --> 00:03:58,294
ANIMALS.

99
00:03:58,294 --> 00:04:00,129
THE WHITE HOUSE SAID HE WAS

100
00:04:00,129 --> 00:04:03,165
REFERRING TO THE CRIMINAL

101
00:04:03,165 --> 00:04:05,801
IMMIGRANT GANG MS-13 AND NOT TO

102
00:04:05,801 --> 00:04:08,337
ALL IMMIGRANTS.

103
00:04:08,337 --> 00:04:11,340
HE DIDN'T MAKE THAT CLEAR.

104
00:04:11,340 --> 00:04:13,676
>> Laura: HE WAS RESPONDING TO A

105
00:04:13,676 --> 00:04:15,378
POINT ABOUT MS-13, ANDREA.

106
00:04:15,378 --> 00:04:17,079
SHE KNOWS BETTER!

107
00:04:17,079 --> 00:04:19,214
THIS, MY FRIEND, IS THE ANATOMY

108
00:04:19,214 --> 00:04:20,315
OF A SMEAR.

109
00:04:20,315 --> 00:04:23,452
TAKE A COMMENT OUT OF CONTEXT.

110
00:04:23,452 --> 00:04:25,788
ISOLATE IT.

111
00:04:25,788 --> 00:04:28,824
BLAST OUT THE WORST POSSIBLE

112
00:04:28,824 --> 00:04:30,826
CHARACTERIZATION OF ITS PURPOSE

113
00:04:30,826 --> 00:04:33,796
AND MEANING AND WRITERS AND

114
00:04:33,796 --> 00:04:35,865
REPORTERS AND POLITICIANS SPIT

115
00:04:35,865 --> 00:04:40,970
IT BACK ON PANELS WHERE THE

116
00:04:41,103 --> 00:04:43,372
NUMBERS THE NUMBER OF BRAIN

117
00:04:43,372 --> 00:04:43,673
CELLS.

118
00:04:43,673 --> 00:04:45,308
AS FOR MS-13, ABOUT WHOM TRUMP

119
00:04:45,308 --> 00:04:48,244
WAS SPEAKING, THIS IS SOME OF

120
00:04:48,244 --> 00:04:50,346
WHAT THEY HAVE BEEN UP TO

121
00:04:50,346 --> 00:04:51,047
LATELY.

122
00:04:51,047 --> 00:04:54,367
IN A HORR IF

123
00:04:54,367 --> 00:04:54,550
IN A HORR I

124
00:04:54,550 --> 00:04:54,583
IN A HORRIF

125
00:04:54,583 --> 00:04:56,452
IN A HORRIFIC

IN A HORRIFIC CRIME I

IN A HORRIFIC CRIME IN

WASHINGTON, D.C. MS-13 MEMBERS

132
00:04:59,088 --> 00:05:01,590
STABBED A MAN AND DECAPITATED

133
00:05:01,590 --> 00:05:03,526
HIM AND TORE THE HEART RIGHT OUT

134
00:05:03,526 --> 00:05:05,394
OF HIS CHEST.

135
00:05:05,394 --> 00:05:08,264
OR IN VIRGINIA, WHERE AN MS-13

136
00:05:08,264 --> 00:05:12,568
GANG MEMBER BEAT A MUSLIM GIRL

137
00:05:12,568 --> 00:05:16,672
TO DEATH WITH A BASEBALL BAT.

138
00:05:16,672 --> 00:05:19,308
AND MURDERING A 17-YEAR-OLD

139
00:05:19,308 --> 00:05:21,610
MUSLIM GIRL WAS ACCUSED OF

140
00:05:21,610 --> 00:05:23,746
SEXUALLY ASSAULTING ANOTHER

141
00:05:23,746 --> 00:05:26,549
WOMAN A WEEK BEFORE THE TEEN

142
00:05:26,549 --> 00:05:28,317
SLAYING IN VIRGINIA AND AN MS-13

143
00:05:28,317 --> 00:05:29,352
GANG MEMBER.

144
00:05:29,352 --> 00:05:31,020
THEN THERE IS THIS HEART

145
00:05:31,020 --> 00:05:33,189
BREAKING ACCOUNT FROM THE

146
00:05:33,189 --> 00:05:37,326
PARENTS OF TEENAGE GIRLS KILLED

147
00:05:37,326 --> 00:05:38,361
BY MS-13 IN NEW YORK.

148
00:05:38,361 --> 00:05:42,264
>> THERE IS NOT A DAY, A SECOND,

149
00:05:42,264 --> 00:05:45,234
THAT I DON'T THINK ABOUT MY

150
00:05:45,368 --> 00:05:49,171
AND, HMMM, THEY JUST DON'T

151
00:05:49,171 --> 00:05:50,706
UNDERSTAND THE PAIN OF A PARENT

152
00:05:50,706 --> 00:05:53,943
LOSING A CHILD TO THIS GANG

153
00:05:53,943 --> 00:05:54,310
VIOLENCE.

154
00:05:54,310 --> 00:05:55,711
I HOPE THEY NEVER WILL.

155
00:05:55,711 --> 00:05:58,647
OUR KIDS SHOULD BE BURYING US,

156
00:05:58,647 --> 00:06:00,783
NOT THE PARENTS BURYING THEIR

157
00:06:00,783 --> 00:06:01,083
KIDS.

158
00:06:01,083 --> 00:06:04,353
THEIR LIVES ARE AHEAD OF THEM.

159
00:06:04,353 --> 00:06:06,489
>> Laura: THAT WAS ONE OF THE

160
00:06:06,489 --> 00:06:08,157
TOUGHEST INTERVIEWS I HAVE DONE

161
00:06:08,157 --> 00:06:09,425
IN THE HISTORY OF THIS SHOW.

162
00:06:09,425 --> 00:06:11,293
THE PAIN ON A MOTHER'S FACE.

163
00:06:11,293 --> 00:06:12,828
AS IF THINGS COULD NOT GET

164
00:06:12,828 --> 00:06:16,332
WORSE, THE SUSPECTS IN THAT CASE

165
00:06:16,332 --> 00:06:18,567
WERE SEEN LAUGHING IN COURT

166
00:06:18,567 --> 00:06:21,737
DURING A PRE-TRIAL HEARING.

167
00:06:21,737 --> 00:06:22,438
UNBELIEVABLE.

168
00:06:22,438 --> 00:06:24,039
NO WONDER SARAH SANDERS

169
00:06:24,039 --> 00:06:28,344
RESPONDED THIS WAY TO THE ANIMAL

170
00:06:28,344 --> 00:06:29,745
FRACUS AT TODAY'S BRIEFING.

171
00:06:29,745 --> 00:06:31,213
>> THE TERM ANIMAL DOESN'T GO

172
00:06:31,213 --> 00:06:32,214
FAR ENOUGH.

173
00:06:32,214 --> 00:06:34,250
I THINK THE PRESIDENT SHOULD

174
00:06:34,250 --> 00:06:36,452
CONTINUE TO USE HIS PLATFORM AND

175
00:06:36,452 --> 00:06:38,387
EVERYTHING HE CAN DO UNDER THE

176
00:06:38,387 --> 00:06:40,790
LAW TO STOP THESE TIMES OF

177
00:06:40,790 --> 00:06:44,093
HORRIBLE, HORRIBLE, DISGUSTING

178
00:06:44,093 --> 00:06:44,427
PEOPLE.

179
00:06:44,427 --> 00:06:45,227
>> Laura: GOOD FOR HER.

180
00:06:45,227 --> 00:06:47,863
I WOULD SAY WE ARE INSULTING

181
00:06:47,863 --> 00:06:48,197
ANIMALS.

182
00:06:48,197 --> 00:06:50,966
THEY DON'T BEHAVE THIS WAY OR

183
00:06:50,966 --> 00:06:51,801
KILL FOR FUN.

184
00:06:51,801 --> 00:06:52,368
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

185
00:06:52,368 --> 00:06:54,336
THE LAST WORD ON THIS GOES TO

186
00:06:54,336 --> 00:06:55,371
THE PRESIDENT.

187
00:06:55,371 --> 00:06:57,706
WHO CLEARED UP ANY CONFUSION FOR

188
00:06:57,706 --> 00:07:01,043
ALL OF THOSE COMMENTATORS ON

189
00:07:01,043 --> 00:07:02,411
MSNBC WITH HIS COMMENTS TODAY.

190
00:07:02,411 --> 00:07:05,614
>> I AM REFERRING AND YOU KNOW I

191
00:07:05,614 --> 00:07:06,615
AM REFERRING TO THE MS-13 GANGS

192
00:07:06,615 --> 00:07:09,351
THAT ARE COMING IN.

193
00:07:09,351 --> 00:07:10,920
WHEN THE MS-13 COMES IN, THE

194
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:12,721
OTHER GANG MEMBERS COME INTO OUR

195
00:07:12,721 --> 00:07:16,292
COUNTRY, I REFER TO THEM AS

196
00:07:16,292 --> 00:07:17,660
ANIMALS, AND I ALWAYS WILL.

197
00:07:17,660 --> 00:07:21,130
>> Laura: THIS IS WHY TRUMP GOT

198
00:07:21,130 --> 00:07:23,899
ELECTED BY SPEAKING BLUNTY AND

199
00:07:23,899 --> 00:07:24,767
HONESTLY.

200
00:07:24,767 --> 00:07:26,969
NOT A LOT OF CONCERN FOR

201
00:07:26,969 --> 00:07:30,539
POLITICAL CORRECT INNS.

202
00:07:30,539 --> 00:07:31,574
-- CORRECTNESS.

203
00:07:31,574 --> 00:07:34,109
PEOPLE ARE DONE WITH THAT

204
00:07:34,109 --> 00:07:34,643
ANYWAY.

205
00:07:34,643 --> 00:07:38,581
HE IS TALKING IT LAW AND ORDER.

206
00:07:38,581 --> 00:07:40,783
HE CHANGED THE POLITICAL

207
00:07:40,783 --> 00:07:43,419
LANDSCAPE AND FRUSTRATED LIBERAL

208
00:07:43,419 --> 00:07:44,653
NARRATIVES BY SPEAKING TO THE

00:07:44,653 --> 00:07:46,455
PEOPLE AS THEY SPEAK AMONG

210
00:07:46,455 --> 00:07:46,889
THEMSELVES.

211
00:07:46,889 --> 00:07:53,229
IF HE KEEPS UP THAT FOCUS, HE

212
00:07:53,229 --> 00:07:55,564
WILL GET ELECTED AGAIN.

213
00:07:55,564 --> 00:07:59,835
PERHAPS, THAT'S WHY THE LEFT IS

214
00:07:59,835 --> 00:00:00,000
ACTING LIKE A PACK OF WILD
