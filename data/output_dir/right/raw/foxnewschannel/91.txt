COWORKERS FOCUS LET THEM TALK TO

60
00:02:12,660 --> 00:02:13,126
THEIR COWORKERS.

61
00:02:13,127 --> 00:02:13,860
BECAUSE AFTER TWO CONVERSATIONS

62
00:02:13,861 --> 00:02:14,661
YOU NEVER WANT TO TALK TO THEM

63
00:02:14,662 --> 00:02:14,961
AGAIN.

64
00:02:14,962 --> 00:02:17,097
WE SAY EVERYBODY NEEDS A FRIEND

I LOVE THESE THINGS.

82
00:02:40,788 --> 00:02:41,254
I HATE CUBICLES.

IT'S VERY GOOD FOR ME.

105
00:03:27,935 --> 00:03:30,437
I JUST THINK IT WOULD BE GREAT

106
00:03:30,438 --> 00:03:31,204
TO COMPLETELY WALL US OFF FROM

107
00:03:31,205 --> 00:03:32,038

00:03:32,039 --> 00:03:40,981
GREAT FOR PRODUCTIVITY.

109
00:03:40,982 --> 00:03:41,481
THIS IS TERRIBLE.

110
00:03:41,482 --> 00:03:42,082
YOU WANT TO KNOW WHY?

111
00:03:42,083 --> 00:03:42,616
I CAN'T SEE ANYONE.

112
00:03:42,617 --> 00:03:44,184

WHAT IS THERE LEFT TO STOP ME

116

FROM WATCHING TEEN MOM RE- ONCE

117
00:03:51,092 --> 00:03:52,859
ON THE APHIS.

118
00:03:52,860 --> 00:04:01,334
HAVING A HARD TIME AS IT IS.

00:04:15,683 --> 00:04:16,450
KNOW WHAT YOUR FACE FEELS LIKE

130
00:04:16,451 --> 00:04:20,187
IF IT WERE AND HOW WITHOUT

131
00:04:20,188 --> 00:04:22,522
