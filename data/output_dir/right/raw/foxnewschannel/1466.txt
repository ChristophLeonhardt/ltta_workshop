I REALLY CAN'T.

00:00:27,520 --> 00:00:29,822
IT WAS A CLASSIFIED BRIEFING.

17
00:00:29,822 --> 00:00:31,390

>> I WON'T GO DOWN THIS HOLE.

26
00:00:45,538 --> 00:00:47,840
SHOULD CONGRESS BE PRIVY TO THIS

27
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:51,410

28
00:00:51,410 --> 00:00:51,844

UNDERESTIMATING THE HE

00:01:53,573 --> 00:01:54,640
CLAPPER KNOWS BETTER AND

TO AN END?

55
00:01:59,345 --> 00:02:01,013
>> I HAVE NO IDEA.

56
00:02:01,013 --> 00:02:03,015
I THINK IT WOULD BE GREAT TO GET

57
00:02:03,015 --> 00:02:06,385
TO A CONCLUSION AND GOT TO A

58
00:02:06,385 --> 00:02:07,220
CONCLUSION SOMETIME SOON.

59
00:02:07,220 --> 00:02:10,021
>> LET'S TURN TO TODAY'S NEWS

60
00:02:10,021 --> 00:02:14,293
ABOUT THE NORTH ORE AEPB

61
00:02:14,293 --> 00:02:14,327
ABOUT THE NORTH KRE AEPB

ABOUT THE NORTH KOREANPB

65
00:02:15,027 --> 00:02:15,461
ABOUT THE NORTH KOREAN SUMMIT.

66
00:02:15,461 --> 00:02:16,162
YOUR REACTION TO THAT?

67
00:02:16,162 --> 00:02:17,830
>> I THINK THE PRESIDENT DID THE

68
00:02:17,830 --> 00:02:18,698
RIGHT THING.

69
00:02:18,698 --> 00:02:21,100
WE HAVE SEEN THREE GENERATIONS

70
00:02:21,100 --> 00:02:24,203
OF NORTH KOREAN LEADERS ENGAGE

71
00:02:24,203 --> 00:02:26,105
IN SIMILAR PLOYS TO GET RELIEF

72
00:02:26,105 --> 00:02:27,607
FROM SANCTIONS.

73
00:02:27,607 --> 00:02:31,978
IT SEEMS THAT KIM JONG-UN IS A

74
00:02:31,978 --> 00:02:33,179
CHIP OFF THE OLD BLOCK.

75
00:02:33,179 --> 00:02:34,547
I THINK THE PRESIDENT DIDN'T

76
00:02:34,547 --> 00:02:36,582
WANT TO BE PLAYED WITH.

77
00:02:36,582 --> 00:02:39,852
WANTED TO MAKE SURE THE NORTH

78
00:02:39,852 --> 00:02:42,855
KOREANS KNEW HE WAS SERIOUS.

79
00:02:42,855 --> 00:02:44,490
PROVIDE THEY DIDN'T CONTINUE TO

80
00:02:44,490 --> 00:02:46,292
PLAY THESE GAMES THEY HAVE

81
00:02:46,292 --> 00:02:47,827
HISTORICALLY DONE WITH OTHER

82
00:02:47,827 --> 00:02:49,762
ADMINISTRATIONS AND HAVE GOTTEN

83
00:02:49,762 --> 00:02:50,963
AWAY WITH IT.

84
00:02:50,963 --> 00:02:52,431
I THINK PRESIDENT TRUMP DID THE

85
00:02:52,431 --> 00:02:54,634
RIGHT THING IN CANCELING THE

86
00:02:54,634 --> 00:02:54,967
MEETING.

87
00:02:54,967 --> 00:02:57,970
>> AS FAR AS DIPLOMATIC MOVES IS

88
00:02:57,970 --> 00:03:00,206
YOUR SENSE THAT THE WHITE HOUSE

89
00:03:00,206 --> 00:03:02,141
AND EXPECTATIONS THAT THIS WILL

90
00:03:02,141 --> 00:03:04,577
GET BACK ON TRACK EVENTUALLY.

91
00:03:04,577 --> 00:03:07,079
>> I THINK WE ALL HOPE IT WILL.

92
00:03:07,079 --> 00:03:08,014
THERE ISN'T ANYTHING THAT

93
00:03:08,014 --> 00:03:13,286
WOULDN'T BE GOOD ABOUT KOREAN

94
00:03:13,286 --> 00:03:14,587
PENINSULA WITHOUT NUCLEAR

95
00:03:14,587 --> 00:03:14,920
WEAPONS.

96
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:16,822
WE HOPE THIS GETS BACK ON TRACK.

97
00:03:16,822 --> 00:03:19,125
THE NEXT STEP, STRIKES ME, IS UP

98
00:03:19,125 --> 00:03:21,661
TO THE NEXT KOREANS.

99
00:03:21,661 --> 00:03:24,530
>> YES OR NO, WILL YOU CANCEL

100
00:03:24,530 --> 00:03:25,931
PART OF THE AUGUST RECESS.

101
00:03:25,931 --> 00:03:31,871
>> I WILL HAVE MORE TO SAY

102
00:03:31,871 --> 00:03:33,039
DEFINITIVELY ABOUT THAT WEEK

103
00:03:33,039 --> 00:03:34,473
AFTER NEXT.

104
00:03:34,473 --> 00:03:37,543
I HAVE SAID THE PRESS CORP AND

00:03:37,543 --> 00:03:40,746

00:03:40,746 --> 00:03:41,414
REFUNDABLE TICKETS.

107
00:03:41,414 --> 00:03:46,619
>> THERE IS A TWEET FROM A

108
00:03:46,619 --> 00:03:49,689
SENATOR THAT I SAID HE DELAYED

109
00:03:49,689 --> 00:03:51,357
HIS VACATION.

110
00:03:51,357 --> 00:03:53,125
YOUR RESPONSE WAS, YOU SHOULD.

111
00:03:53,125 --> 00:03:54,994
IF CONGRESS CAN'T GET DONE WHAT

112
00:03:54,994 --> 00:03:56,762
THEY NEED FROM JANUARY TO JULY

113
00:03:56,762 --> 00:03:58,764
HOW MUCH WILL A COUPLE OF WEEKS

114
00:03:58,764 --> 00:03:59,332
HELP YOU?

115
00:03:59,332 --> 00:04:02,201
>> BRET, THIS HAS BEEN A PERIOD

116
00:04:02,201 --> 00:04:04,737
OF EXTRAORDINARY ACCOMPLISHMENT.

117
00:04:04,737 --> 00:04:06,939
THE NOTION THAT THIS CONGRESS

118
00:04:06,939 --> 00:04:09,709
HASN'T DONE ANYTHING IS UTTER

119
00:04:09,709 --> 00:04:11,010
NONSENSE, DISPROVED BY THE

120
00:04:11,010 --> 00:04:11,377
FACTS.

121
00:04:11,377 --> 00:04:13,579
THIS HAS BEEN THE MOST

122
00:04:13,579 --> 00:04:15,114
PRODUCTIVE YEAR IN A HALF IN THE

123
00:04:15,114 --> 00:04:16,849
TIME I HAVE BEEN IN THE SENATE.

124
00:04:16,849 --> 00:04:21,320
I'M NOW IN MY THIRD DECADE.

125
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:22,421
PARTICULARLY FOR THOSE WHO WANT

126
00:04:22,421 --> 00:04:24,790
TO SEE THE COUNTRY RIGHT OF

127
00:04:24,790 --> 00:04:25,257
CENTER.

128
00:04:25,257 --> 00:04:27,126
WHETHER IT'S SUPREME COURT,

00:04:27,126 --> 00:04:29,261
COURT OF REGULATIONS, TAX

130
00:04:29,261 --> 00:04:29,595
REFORM.

131
00:04:29,595 --> 00:04:34,200
JUST THIS WEEK ALONE WE PASSED A

132
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:35,267
VETERAN'S CHOICE ACT.

133
00:04:35,267 --> 00:04:37,403
A MAJOR SIGNIFICANT PIECE OF

134
00:04:37,403 --> 00:04:37,803
LEGISLATION.

135
00:04:37,803 --> 00:04:40,973
THE RECORD OF THIS CONGRESS IS

136
00:04:40,973 --> 00:04:41,841
QUITE SPECTACULAR.

137
00:04:41,841 --> 00:04:44,477
WE WILL ADD MORE ACHIEVEMENTS

138
00:04:44,477 --> 00:04:46,145
THROUGHOUT THE SUMMER.

139
00:04:46,145 --> 00:04:48,347
FULLY INTEND TO BY TAKING UP THE

140
00:04:48,347 --> 00:04:51,450
FARM BILL, THE NATIONAL DEFENSE

00:04:51,450 --> 00:04:53,319
AUTHORIZATION ACT, AND

142
00:04:53,319 --> 00:04:54,587
FUNCTIONING ON APPROPRIATION

143
00:04:54,587 --> 00:04:57,289
BILLS WHICH THE DEMOCRATS

144
00:04:57,289 --> 00:04:58,724
GROUNDED TO A HALT LAST YEAR.

145
00:04:58,724 --> 00:05:00,393
WE DON'T THINK THAT WILL HAPPEN

146
00:05:00,393 --> 00:05:00,926
THIS YEAR.

147
00:05:00,926 --> 00:05:04,497
>> I WASN'T SUGGESTING YOU HAD

148
00:05:04,497 --> 00:05:05,064
NOTHING DONE.

149
00:05:05,064 --> 00:05:07,166
I WAS SUGGESTING HOW MUCH MORE

150
00:05:07,166 --> 00:05:09,268
COULD GET DONE IN THE ADDITIONAL

151
00:05:09,268 --> 00:05:10,770
TIME IF YOU CHOOSE TO DO THAT.

152
00:05:10,770 --> 00:05:14,573
IF THE HOUSE DISCHARGES POSITION

153
00:05:14,573 --> 00:05:18,878
ON DACA SUCCEED WOULD YOU TAKE

154
00:05:18,878 --> 00:05:19,345
THAT UP?

155
00:05:19,345 --> 00:05:22,581
>> MY THOUGHTS ON IMMIGRATION.

156
00:05:22,581 --> 00:05:26,352
IN FEBRUARY I BROUGHT UP THE

157
00:05:26,352 --> 00:05:27,620
SUBJECT OF IMMIGRATION.

158
00:05:27,620 --> 00:05:30,022
WE SPENT A WEEK ON THE SENATE

159
00:05:30,022 --> 00:05:31,323
FLOOR AND PASSED NOTHING.

160
00:05:31,323 --> 00:05:34,660
IF THERE IS A BILL THAT CLEARS

161
00:05:34,660 --> 00:05:36,962
THE HOUSE THEN I WILL GIVE IT

162
00:05:36,962 --> 00:05:37,696
SERIOUS CONSIDERATION.

163
00:05:37,696 --> 00:05:41,066
WE WOULD BE MAKING A LAW, NOT

164
00:05:41,066 --> 00:05:43,736
JUST SPINNING OUR WHEELS FOR A

165
00:05:43,736 --> 00:05:45,538
WEEK OR . SO I CAN'T AFFORD TO

166
00:05:45,538 --> 00:05:46,305
DO THAT.

167
00:05:46,305 --> 00:05:48,574
WE HAVE APPROPRIATION BILLS TO

168
00:05:48,574 --> 00:05:50,776
PASS AND OTHER MEASURES THAT I

169
00:05:50,776 --> 00:05:52,778
JUST MENTIONED THAT WILL TAKE UP

170
00:05:52,778 --> 00:05:53,579
FLOOR TIME.

171
00:05:53,579 --> 00:05:55,614
NOT TO MENTION ADDITIONAL

AT ALL.

184
00:06:18,537 --> 00:06:22,241
OUR PRESIDENTCY HAS BEEN DEBASED

00:06:36,989 --> 00:06:38,891
GOVERNMENT, THE CONGRESS, THAT'S

192
00:06:38,891 --> 00:06:45,097
ME, IS SUPLINE AND THE VANDALISM

193
00:06:45,097 --> 00:06:46,832
FLOWING FROM THE WHITE HOUSE

194
00:06:46,832 --> 00:06:47,132
DAILY.

195
00:06:47,132 --> 00:06:48,701
>> YOUR REACTION TO, THAT

196
00:06:48,701 --> 00:06:49,034
SENATOR.

197
00:06:49,034 --> 00:06:51,303
>> OBVIOUSLY I DIDN'T AGREE

198
00:06:51,303 --> 00:06:51,604
WITH.

199
00:06:51,604 --> 00:06:54,406
THAT I WISH JEFF WOULD RUN AGAIN

200
00:06:54,406 --> 00:06:56,041
AND STAY IN CONGRESS AND TRY TO

201
00:06:56,041 --> 00:06:57,510
HAVE A IMPACT.

202
00:06:57,510 --> 00:07:02,781
HE DECIDED TO LEAVE, TO RETIRE.

203
00:07:02,781 --> 00:07:04,617
HE CAN SAY WHAT HE WILL.

204
00:07:04,617 --> 00:07:06,852
I DON'T AGREE.

205
00:07:06,852 --> 00:07:09,121
I THINK THIS HAS BEEN A PERIOD

206
00:07:09,121 --> 00:07:11,023
OF EXTRAORDINARY ACCOMPLISHMENT

207
00:07:11,023 --> 00:07:15,361
BY THE PRESIDENT AND CONGRESS.

208
00:07:15,361 --> 00:07:21,800
>> SENATOR TOMBY POINTED OUT:

209
00:07:28,774 --> 00:07:34,747
>> IT SEEMS A PUSH BACK IN THE

210
00:07:34,747 --> 00:07:35,748
REPUBLICANS RANKS AS WELL.

211
00:07:35,748 --> 00:07:39,518
>> I TEND TO AGREE WITH TOMB EON

212
00:07:39,518 --> 00:07:40,953
THAT AS WELL.

213
00:07:40,953 --> 00:07:43,589
I WORRY ABOUT RETALIATION AND

214
00:07:43,589 --> 00:07:45,925
IMPACTS ON AMERICAN AGRICULTURE.

215
00:07:45,925 --> 00:07:49,395
A PLACE WHERE WE ENJOY

216
00:07:49,395 --> 00:07:50,729
SUBSTANTIAL TRADE SURPLUSES WITH

217
00:07:50,729 --> 00:07:52,097
THE REST OF THE WORLD.

218
00:07:52,097 --> 00:07:54,700
I THINK ALL OF US HOPE THIS BACK

219
00:07:54,700 --> 00:07:56,468
AND FORTH DISCUSSION ABOUT TRADE

220
00:07:56,468 --> 00:07:58,704
DOESN'T END UP LEADING US INTO

221
00:07:58,704 --> 00:08:00,806
THE IMPLEMENTATION OF TARIFFS OR

222
00:08:00,806 --> 00:08:01,974
A LARGER TRADE WAR.

223
00:08:01,974 --> 00:08:04,310
>> HEAR ANYTHING FROM SENATOR

224
00:08:04,310 --> 00:08:04,643
McCAIN?

225
00:08:04,643 --> 00:08:05,644
>> I HAVEN'T.

226
00:08:05,644 --> 00:08:07,646
I HAD A CHANCE TO VISIT HIM A

227
00:08:07,646 --> 00:08:09,448
COUPLE OF WEEKS AGO OUT IN

228
00:08:09,448 --> 00:08:10,616
ARIZONA.

229
00:08:10,616 --> 00:08:12,484
HE

230
00:08:12,484 --> 00:08:14,653
WE HAD A GOOD DISCUSSION ABOUT

231
00:08:14,653 --> 00:08:16,689
ALL OF THE BATTLES OF THE PAST.

232
00:08:16,689 --> 00:08:18,357
SOMETIMES WE WERE NOT ON THE

233
00:08:18,357 --> 00:08:19,058
SAME SIDE.

234
00:08:19,058 --> 00:08:20,326
HE'S A GREAT AMERICAN.

235
00:08:20,326 --> 00:00:00,000
WE WISH HE COULD COME BACK.
