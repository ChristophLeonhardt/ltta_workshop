the only only time when you really
refuse to say anything even to issue a
denial of something that of a very clear
accusation is if there's at least some
truth to it and so you need to figure
out how to craft it but then the other
as I said the other the other
explanation is that you you
have disdain for the person asking the
question and you think that the
accusations are so ridiculous that they
aren't do a response
now that is that's like there's there's
a video of a but Buzz Aldrin he was
confronted few years ago by a moon
landing conspiracy theorist one of these
guys that thinks the moon landing never
happened and Aldrin refuses to respond
to him and that eventually just punches
him in the face which is great by the
way they just think that's awesome
refused to respond just plant clocks the
guy in the face now that is an
appropriate response because the claim
that you faked the moon landing is so
stupid so ridiculous so beneath it's so
really contemptible that it is not do an
answer except for a punch in the nose
this doesn't fall into that
because we already know that there has
been a far-reaching conspiracy within
the hierarchy of the church to cover up
sexual abuse we know that perfect
so this is not a moon landing conspiracy
and when you're asked about it
it is your moral duty to respond and if
it's not true to issue that
clarification and to give reassurance to
the faithful
