THE WHITE HOUSE WHERE JUST 
MOMENTS AGO PRESIDENT TRUMP 
MADE A MAJOR ANNOUNCEMENT ON 
TRADE. 
YOU SEE THE PRESIDENT GETTING 
READY TO SIT DOWN RIGHT HERE. 
LET'S DIP IN. 
THE FOCUS IS NAFTA. 
>> THIS HAS TO DO, THEY USED TO 
CALL IT NAFTA. 
WE ARE GOING TO CALL IT THE 
UNITED STATES-MEXICO TRADE 
AGREEMENT. 
WE WILL GET RID OF THE NAME 
NAFTA. 
HAS A BAD CONNOTATION. 
NOW IT IS A REALLY GOOD DEAL 
FOR BOTH COUNTRIES, AND WE LOOK 
VERY MUCH FORWARD TO IT. 
I BELIEVE THE PRESIDENT IS ON 
THE PHONE. 
HENRIQUE? 
YOU CAN HOOK THEM UP. 
YOU TELL ME WHEN. 
IT'S A BIG THING. 
A LOT OF PEOPLE WAITING. 
HELLO? 
YOU WANT TO PUT THAT ON THIS 
PHONE PLEASE? 
HELLO. 
THAT BE HELPFUL. 
THANK YOU. 
>> PRESIDENT TRUMP, HOW ARE 
YOU, GOOD MORNING. 
>> THANK YOU. 
CONGRATULATIONS. 
IT'S REALLY A FANTASTIC THING. 
WE HAVE ALL WORKED REALLY HARD. 
YOUR BRILLIANT REPRESENTATIVES 
ARE SITTING RIGHT IN FRONT OF 
ME, AND I THOUGHT WE WOULD 
CONGRATULATE EACH OTHER BEFORE 
IT GOT OUT, AND I KNOW WE WILL 
HAVE A FORMAL NEWS CONFERENCE 
IN THE NOT-TOO-DISTANT FUTURE 
-- DISTANT FUTURE. 
>> THANK YOU VERY MUCH, 
PRESIDENT TRUMP. 
I THINK THIS IS SOMETHING VERY 
POSITIVE FOR THE UNITED STATES 
AND MEXICO. THE FIRST REASON 
FOR THIS CALL, MR. PRESIDENT, 
IS, FIRST OF ALL, TO CELEBRATE 
THE UNDERSTANDING WE HAVE 
BETWEEN BOTH NEGOTIATING TEAMS 
ON NAFTA. THIS IS INTEREST WE 
HAVE HAD FOR QUITE A FEW MONTHS 
NOW TO RENEW IT, TO MODERNIZE 
IT, TWO UPDATE IT, AND TO 
GENERATE A FRAMEWORK THAT WILL 
CREATE PRODUCTIVITY IN NORTH 
AMERICA. 
IT IS OUR WISH, MR. PRESIDENT, 
THAT NOW CANADA WILL ULTIMATELY 
WANT TO BE INCORPORATED IN ALL 
OF THIS. 
AND I ASSUME THAT WE ARE GOING 
TO CARRY OUT NEGOTIATIONS OF 
THE SENSITIVE BILATERAL ISSUES 
BETWEEN MEXICO -- RATHER, 
BETWEEN CANADA AND THE UNITED 
STATES. 
I AM REALLY GRATEFUL, MR. 
PRESIDENT. 
I WANT TO TELL YOU THAT I 
GREATLY RECOGNIZE AND 
ACKNOWLEDGE YOUR POLITICAL WILL 
AND YOUR PARTICIPATION IN THIS. 
AND ON THE SAME PATH, I WANT TO 
BEAR MY TESTIMONY, MR. 
PRESIDENT, AND MY 
ACKNOWLEDGMENT TO BOTH 
NEGOTIATING TEAMS, ESPECIALLY 
THE TEAM THAT IS HEADED AND LED 
BY MR. ROBERT, AND ALSO THE 
ACCOMPANIMENT AND THE SUPPORT 
FROM THE HOUSE THROUGH JARED 
KUSHNER. 
AND I ALSO EXTEND THIS 
RECOGNITION TO THE MEXICAN TEAMS
. WE ARE LISTENING TO YOU. 
THE FOREIGN MINISTER AND THE 
SECRETARY OF THE CURRENT 
MINISTER. 
THIS IS, OF COURSE, A 
NEGOTIATION THAT HAS TAKEN 
MONTHS. 
IT HAS BEEN DIFFICULT. 
IT'S A VERY HARD NEGOTIATION 
ALTOGETHER WITH DIFFICULT 
MOMENTS, OF COURSE, BUT I TRULY 
ACKNOWLEDGE NOW WE'VE BEEN ABLE 
TO REACH AN AGREEMENT THAT WE 
ARE ABOUT TO MAKE PUBLIC, AND 
THIS IS THE RESULT OF GOOD 
UNDERSTANDING AND GOOD WORK, 
AND I, OF COURSE, AND QUITE 
HOPEFUL THAT NOW CANADA WILL 
START DISCUSSING WITH THE 
UNITED STATES THE SENSITIVE 
BILATERAL ISSUES. 
CONGRATULATIONS. I AM VERY 
GRATEFUL AND I AM ATTENTIVE TO 
YOUR COMMENTS. 
>> MR. PRESIDENT, THANK YOU 
VERY MUCH. 
IT'S AN HONOR. 
YOU HAVE BEEN MY FRIEND. 
IT HAS BEEN A LONG TIME SINCE 
I'VE TRAVELED TO MEXICO WHERE 
WE GOT TO KNOW EACH OTHER QUITE 
WELL, AND WE ACTUALLY HAD A 
GOOD MEETING. 
SOME PEOPLE WEREN'T SURE IF IT 
WAS A GOOD MEETING, BUT I WAS. 
I HAVE A LOT OF GOOD MEETINGS 
THAT A LOT OF PEOPLE AREN'T 
SURE IF THEY WERE GOOD OR NOT. 
BUT IT'S BEEN A LONG TIME, AND 
THIS IS SOMETHING THAT'S VERY 
SPECIAL FOR OUR MANUFACTURERS 
AND FOR OUR FARMERS. 
ALL OF THE PEOPLE THAT WORK FOR 
JOBS, IT'S ALSO GREAT TRADE. 
IT MAKES IT A MUCH MORE FAIR 
BILL, AND WE ARE VERY, VERY 
EXCITED ABOUT THAT. 
WE HAVE WORKED WANT -- WORKED 
LONG AND HARD. 
YOUR REPRESENTATIVES HAVE BEEN 
TERRIFIC. 
MY REPRESENTATIVES HAVE BEEN 
FANTASTIC, TOO. 
THEY'VE GOTTEN ALONG VERY WELL 
AND THEY WORKED LATE INTO THE 
NIGHT FOR MONTHS. 
AN EXTREMELY COMPLEX BILL, AND 
IT'S SOMETHING THAT I THINK WE 
WILL TALK ABOUT FOR MANY YEARS 
TO COME. 
JUST GOOD FOR BOTH COUNTRIES. 
AS FAR AS CANADA IS CONCERNED, 
WE HAVEN'T STARTED WITH CANADA 
YET. 
WE WANTED TO DO MEXICO AND SEE 
IF THAT WAS POSSIBLE TO DO, AND 
I THINK IT WASN'T FROM ANY 
STANDPOINT SOMETHING THAT MOST 
PEOPLE THOUGHT WAS EVEN DOABLE 
WHEN WE STARTED, IF YOU LOOK AT 
IT. 
YOU REMEMBER AT THE BEGINNING 
MANY PEOPLE THOUGHT THAT THIS 
WAS SOMETHING THAT JUST 
COULDN'T HAPPEN BECAUSE OF ALL 
THE DIFFERENT FACTIONS, ALL THE 
DIFFERENT SIDES, AND THE 
COMPLEXITY. 
WE MADE IT MUCH SIMPLER, MUCH 
BETTER, MUCH BETTER FOR BOTH 
COUNTRIES. 
CANADA WILL START NEGOTIATIONS 
SHORTLY. 
I'LL BE CALLING THE PRIME 
MINISTER VERY SOON AND WE WILL 
START NEGOTIATIONS. 
IF THEY LIKE TO NEGOTIATE 
FAIRLY, WE WILL DO THAT. 
YOU KNOW, THEY HAVE TARIFFS OF 
ALMOST 300% ON SOME OF OUR 
DAIRY PRODUCTS THAT WE CAN'T 
HAVE THAT. 
WE ARE NOT GOING TO STAND FOR 
THAT. 
I THINK WITH CANADA, FRANKLY, 
THE EASIEST THING WE COULD DO 
IS TO TERRACE THEIR CARS COMING 
IN. 
IT'S A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF 
MONEY AND IT'S A VERY SIMPLE 
NEGOTIATION. 
IT COULD END IN ONE DAY AND WE 
TAKE IN A LOT OF MONEY THE 
FOLLOWING DAY. 
BUT I THINK WE WILL GIVE THEM 
THE CHANCE TO PROBABLY HAVE A 
SEPARATE DEAL. 
WE COULD HAVE A SEPARATE DEAL 
THAT WE COULD PUT IT INTO THIS 
DEAL. 
I LIKE TO CALL THIS DEAL UNITED 
STATES-MEXICO TRADE AGREEMENT. 
I THINK IT'S AN ELEGANT NAME. 
I THINK NAFTA HAS A LOT OF BAD 
CONNOTATIONS FOR THE UNITED 
STATES BECAUSE IT WAS A RIPOFF. 
IT WAS A DEAL THAT WAS A 
HORRIBLE DEAL FOR OUR COUNTRY. 
I THINK IT'S GOT A LOT OF BAD 
CONNOTATIONS TO A LOT OF 
PEOPLE, AND SO WE WILL -- 
PROBABLY YOU AND I WILL AGREE 
TO THE NAME. 
WE WILL SEE WHETHER OR NOT WE 
DECIDE TO PUT UP CANADA OR JUST 
DO A SEPARATE DEAL WITH CANADA 
IF THEY WANT TO MAKE THE DEAL 
THE SIMPLEST DEAL IS MORE OR 
LESS ALREADY MADE AND VERY EASY 
TO DO AND EXECUTE. 
BUT I WILL TELL YOU THAT 
WORKING WITH YOU HAS BEEN A 
PLEASURE. 
SPEAKING WITH AND WORKING WITH 
PRESIDENT-ELECT LOPEZ HAS BEEN 
ABSOLUTELY A VERY, VERY SPECIAL 
TIME. 
YOU BOTH CAME TOGETHER FOR YOUR 
COUNTRY. 
YOU WORK TOGETHER. 
I THINK THAT'S IMPORTANT FOR 
THE MEDIA TO KNOW WE HAVE A 
SMALL AMOUNT OF MEDIA IN OUR 
PRESENCE LIKE EVERYBODY. 
THE MEDIA SHOULD KNOW THAT THE 
PRESIDENT AND THE PRESIDENT 
ELECT WORKED VERY CLOSELY 
TOGETHER BECAUSE THE PRESIDENT 
FELT IT WAS IMPORTANT THE 
PRESIDENT-ELECT LIKED WHAT HE 
WAS SEEING AND OUR TEAMS WORK 
TOGETHER. 
OUR TEAMS WERE REALLY WELL 
UNIFIED, AND YOUR TEAM WAS VERY 
WELL UNIFIED. 
I WAS VERY IMPRESSED WITH THE 
FACT THAT THE TWO PRESIDENTS 
CAME TOGETHER AND WORKED OUT 
SOMETHING MUTUALLY AGREEABLE. 
SO IT'S AN INCREDIBLE DEAL. 
IT'S AN INCREDIBLE DEAL FOR 
BOTH PARTIES. 
MOST IMPORTANT, IT'S AN 
INCREDIBLE DEAL FOR THE WORKERS 
AND FOR THE CITIZENS OF BOTH 
COUNTRIES. 
OUR FARMERS ARE GOING TO BE SO 
HAPPY. 
THE FARMERS HAVE STUCK WITH ME. 
I SAID WE WERE GOING TO DO 
THIS. 
MEXICO HAS PROMISED TO 
IMMEDIATELY START PURCHASING AS 
MUCH FARM PRODUCT AS THEY CAN. 
THEY ARE GOING TO WORK ON THAT 
VERY HARD. 
AS YOU KNOW, WE ARE WORKING -- 
UNRELATED TO THIS, WE ARE 
WORKING VERY MUCH WITH OTHER 
COUNTRIES. 
CHINA IS ONE. 
THEY WANT TO TALK. 
IT'S JUST NOT THE RIGHT TIME TO 
TALK RIGHT NOW, TO BE HONEST. 
IT'S TOO ONE-SIDED FOR TOO MANY 
YEARS AND TOO MANY DECADES. 
SO IT'S NOT THE RIGHT TIME TO 
TALK, BUT EVENTUALLY I'M SURE 
WE ARE ABLE TO WORK OUT A DEAL 
WITH CHINA. 
IN THE MEANTIME, WE ARE DOING 
VERY WELL WITH CHINA. 
OUR ECONOMY IS UP. 
IT'S NEVER BEEN THIS GOOD 
BEFORE, AND I THINK IT'S ONLY 
GOING TO GET BETTER. 
BUT, MR. PRESIDENT, YOU'VE BEEN 
MY FRIEND AND YOU HAVE BEEN 
SOMEBODY THAT'S BEEN VERY 
SPECIAL IN A LOT OF WAYS. 
WE TALK A LOT ABOUT THIS DEAL 
AND I'D LIKE TO CONGRATULATE 
YOU AND THE MEXICAN PEOPLE. 
>> THANK YOU VERY MUCH, MR. 
PRESIDENT. 
I RECOGNIZE THAT WE ARE NOW 
REACHING ON THIS DEAL. 
AND I REALLY HOPE THAT THE PART 
WITH CANADA WILL BE 
MATERIALIZING IN A VERY QUICK 
FASHION. 
THAT WE CAN HAVE AN AGREEMENT. 
BUT TODAY I CELEBRATE THE 
UNITED STATES AND MEXICO, 
BECAUSE WE ARE REACHING A FINAL 
UNDERSTANDING, AND I HOPE THAT 
IN THE FOLLOWING DAYS WE CAN 
MATERIALIZE SOMETHING IN THE 
FORMALIZATION OF THIS 
AGREEMENT, SOMETHING 
ADDITIONAL, MR. PRESIDENT, YOU 
HAVE ALREADY MENTIONED IT. 
IT HAS TO DO WITH PARTICIPATION 
OF THE ADMINISTRATION AND THE 
PRESIDENT-ELECT OF MEXICO. 
AS YOU KNOW, WE ARE NOW GOING 
THROUGH A TRANSITION, AND IT 
HAS BEEN POSSIBLE TO CREATE A 
HIGHLY UNIFIED FRONT BETWEEN 
THE NEGOTIATING TEAM OF THIS 
ADMINISTRATION, THE PEOPLE 
APPOINTED BY THE PRESIDENT-
ELECT OF MEXICO TO PARTICIPATE 
IN THIS AGREEMENT IN THIS 
UNDERSTANDING TO REACH THIS 
TIME WE ARE NOW REACHING. 
PRESIDENT-ELECT HAS BEEN AWARE 
OF EVERYTHING THAT HAS BEEN 
HAPPENING, AND I AM ALSO HAVING 
THE OPPORTUNITY OF TALKING HIM 
DIRECTLY AND PERSONALLY ON THE 
PROGRESS BEING MADE. 
YOU HAVE ALSO HAD DIRECT 
CONVERSATIONS WITH PRESIDENT-
ELECT. 
I HOPE WE HAVE THE SPACE TO DO 
IT, TO A GOOD TOAST WITH 
TEQUILA, OF COURSE, TO 
CELEBRATE THIS UNDERSTANDING. 
>> I THINK THAT'S EXACTLY 
RIGHT, AND YOU KNOW THE GOOD 
RELATIONSHIP THAT I'VE ALREADY 
ESTABLISHED WITH THE PRESIDENT-
ELECT. 
I WAS VERY IMPRESSED WITH HIM, 
I MUST TELL YOU. 
HE WAS TERRIFIC IN EVERY WAY. 
HE LOVES YOUR COUNTRY LIKE YOU 
LOVE YOUR COUNTRY. 
YOU WANT TO DO THE RIGHT THING. 
WE ARE REALLY DOING THE RIGHT 
THING FOR ALL OF US, SO I 
REALLY ENJOYED THAT. 
PLEASE SEND HIM MY REGARDS. I 
WILL SPEAK TO HIM VERY SHORTLY, 
BUT THIS WAS GREAT THAT YOU ARE 
ABLE TO DO IT TOGETHER. 
I THINK DOING IT MUTUALLY AS 
OPPOSED TO JUST YOU DOING IT, 
OR EVEN JUST HIM DOING IT, I 
THINK A MUTUAL AGREEMENT 
BETWEEN YOUR TWO 
ADMINISTRATIONS WAS A FANTASTIC 
THING. 
I SUGGESTED THAT EARLY ON, AND 
I THINK IT WAS IMMEDIATELY 
EMBRACED AND I THINK IT WAS A 
REALLY FANTASTIC THING THAT YOU 
WERE ABLE TO DO IT. 
AND WITH GREAT SPIRIT. 
IT WAS GREAT COORDINATION AND 
SPIRIT. 
I THINK THAT IS REALLY JUST 
GREAT. 
ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I'M 
EXCITED ABOUT IS YOU ARE GOING 
TO BE HELPING US AT THE BORDER. 
YOU'RE GOING TO BE WORKING 
TOGETHER WITH US ON 
AGRICULTURE. 
YOU'RE GOING TO BE WORKING IN 
MANY DIFFERENT WAYS, AND WE ARE 
GOING TO BE WORKING WITH YOU IN 
MANY DIFFERENT WAYS. 
IT'S A VERY COMPREHENSIVE 
AGREEMENT. 
I WILL SEE YOU SOON. 
I THINK WE ARE GOING TO HAVE A 
VERY FORMAL CEREMONY. 
THIS IS ONE OF THE LARGEST 
TRADE DEALS EVER MADE, MAYBE 
THE LARGEST TRADE DEAL EVER 
MADE, AND IT'S REALLY SOMETHING 
VERY SPECIAL THAT TWO COUNTRIES 
WERE ABLE TO COME TOGETHER AND 
GET IT DONE, AND I JUST WANT TO 
THANK ALL OF MY PEOPLE. 
BOB AND JARED AND, GENTLEMEN, 
YOU HAVE BEEN REALLY GREAT THE 
WAY YOU'VE WORKED SO LONG. 
I KNOW YOU'VE BEEN GOING TILL 
3:00, 4:00 IN THE MORNING AND 
THEN GETTING IN AT 8:00. 
I JUST WANT TO, ON BEHALF OF 
THE UNITED STATES, I WANT TO 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH. 
I CAN SAY THAT MEXICO IS VERY 
PROUD OF YOU. 
WE'RE VERY PROUD OF YOU. 
THANK YOU ALL VERY MUCH. 
SEE YOU SOON. 
I WILL TALK TO YOU SOON, AND 
CONGRATULATIONS. 
JOB WELL DONE. 
>> THANK YOU, MR. PRESIDENT. 
WE WILL BE WAITING FOR CANADA 
TO BE INTEGRATED INTO THIS 
PROCESS. 
MY REGARDS. 
>> A HUG FROM YOU WOULD BE VERY 
NICE. 
THANK YOU. 
SO LONG. 
THANKS. 
OKAY. 
SO WE HAVE MADE THE DEAL WITH 
CANADA. 
IT'S A VERY -- SORRY, WE MADE 
THE DEAL WITH MEXICO, AND I 
THINK IT'S A GREAT DEAL. 
WE ARE STARTING NEGOTIATIONS 
WITH CANADA PRETTY MUCH 
IMMEDIATELY. 
I CAN'T TELL YOU WHERE THOSE 
NEGOTIATIONS HAVE GONE. 
IT'S A SMALLER SEGMENT, AS YOU 
KNOW. 
MEXICO IS A VERY LARGE TRADING 
PARTNER, BUT WE HAVE NOW 
CONCLUDED OUR DEAL, AND IT'S 
BEING FINALIZED AND, BOB, WHEN 
WOULD YOU SAY IT WOULD BE 
SIGNED? 
>> WELL, IT WOULD LIKELY BE 
SIGNED AT THE END OF NOVEMBER. 
IT MIGHT BE A DAY LAYOVER 
BECAUSE OF OUR STAFF, BUT WE 
EXPECT TO SEE THAT OUR LETTER 
TO CONGRESS BEGINNING THAT úPRO 
90 DAYS LATER IT WILL BE 
SIGNED. 
>> WE HAVE AN AGREEMENT WHERE, 
BOTH WITH CANADA AND WITH 
MEXICO, I WILL TERMINATE THE 
EXISTING DEAL. 
WHEN THAT HAPPENS, I CAN'T 
QUITE TELL YOU. IT DEPENDS ON 
WHAT THE TIMETABLE IS WITH 
CONGRESS, BUT I WILL BE 
TERMINATING THE EXISTING DEAL 
AND GOING INTO THIS DEAL. 
WE WILL START NEGOTIATING WITH 
CANADA RELATIVELY SOON. 
THEY WANT TO NEGOTIATE VERY 
BADLY, BUT ONE WAY OR THE OTHER 
WE WILL HAVE A DEAL WITH 
CANADA. 
IT WILL BE A TERRORIST OR 
NEGOTIATED DEAL. 
FRANKLY, A TARIFF IS A MUCH 
EASIER WAY TO GO, BUT PERHAPS 
THE OTHER WOULD BE EASIER FOR 
CANADA. 
WE ARE LOOKING TO HELP OUR 
NEIGHBORS, TOO. 
IF WE CAN HELP OUR NEIGHBORS, 
THAT'S A GOOD THING, NOT A BAD 
THING. 
SO WE ARE GOING TO START THE 
NEGOTIATION IMMINENTLY. 
I WILL BE SPEAKING WITH PRIME 
MINISTER TRUDEAU IN A LITTLE 
WHILE. 
SO I WANT TO THANK EVERYBODY. 
I WANT TO THANK YOU. 
WHAT A GREAT JOB YOU HAVE ALL 
DONE, AND IT HAS BEEN A LONG 
ONE, BUT A LOT OF PEOPLE 
THOUGHT THIS WAS NOT A DOABLE 
TRANSACTION. 
IT'S GOING TO BE GREAT FOR OUR 
PEOPLE. AGAIN, I WANT TO THANK 
YOU FOLKS, AND WE WILL SEE YOU 
AT THE SIGNING AND WE WILL SEE 
MANY TIMES BEFORE THAT I'M 
SURE. 
SO CONGRATULATIONS TO THE 
PEOPLE OF MEXICO. 
GREAT JOB. 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH, EVERYBODY. 
>> MR. PRESIDENT, ANY THOUGHTS 
ON JOHN McCAIN? 
ANY THOUGHTS ON JOHN McCAIN, 
SIR? 
>> THANKS, EVERYBODY. 
LET'S GO THIS WAY. 
>> SO WE HAVE JUST BEEN 
LISTENING TO PRESIDENT DONALD 
TRUMP AND MEXICAN PRESIDENT ON 
THE PHONE. 
HE'S THE OUTGOING PRESIDENT 
TALKING ABOUT A NEW DEAL, 
BILATERAL TRADE DEAL THAT THE 
TWO COUNTRIES HAVE HAMMERED 
OUT. 
YOU MIGHT RECALL THAT THE 
PRESIDENT, ONE OF THE THINGS HE 
CAMPAIGNED ON WAS REVISING 
NAFTA. 
NOW, THIS WASN'T A REVISION OF 
NAFTA BECAUSE THAT WOULD ALSO 
HAVE TO INCLUDE CANADA, BUT IT 
WAS A SEPARATE DEAL WITH 
MEXICO, AND IF YOU HEARD ON THE 
PHONE THAT HE WOULD ENCOURAGE 
CANADA BECAUSE CANADA HAD 
STEPPED AWAY FROM ANY SORT OF 
REVISION NO GO SHE ADDITIONS. 
THAT'S WHAT THEY'VE BEEN 
TALKING ABOUT. 
THE FOCUS IS PRIMARILY ON THE 
AUTOMOBILE INDUSTRY AND METAL 
GOODS, ALUMINUM, STEEL, AND THE 
ISSUE WITH THAT INDUSTRY IN 
PARTICULAR IS A SUPPLY CHAIN IS 
INTEGRATED THROUGHOUT ALL THREE 
COUNTRIES, SO IT'S VERY 
IMPORTANT THAT ALL THREE 
COUNTRIES AGREE ON TARIFFS AND 
ON THINGS MOVING FORWARD. 
CBS NEWS WHITE HOUSE 
CORRESPONDENT WE SHOULD JANG 
JOINED ME NOW WITH MORE ON THE 
PRESIDENT'S COMMENTS. 
SO THIS IS NOT A REVISION OF 
NAFTA. 
THE PRESIDENT COULDN'T DO THAT 
WITHOUT CANADA AND WITHOUT 
CONGRESSIONAL APPROVAL. 
THIS SOUNDS LIKE A BRAND-NEW 
DEAL WITH MEXICO. 
>> RIGHT. 
THIS SOUNDS LIKE A BILATERAL 
DEAL WITH MEXICO, AND THE 
PRESIDENT SET THE STAGE FOR 
THAT WHEN HE TWEETED THIS 
MORNING, A BIG DEAL LOOKING 
GOOD WITH MEXICO. 
AT THAT TIME, BEFORE THIS 
OFFICIAL ANNOUNCEMENT FROM THE 
OVAL OFFICE, THE ASSUMPTION WAS 
THAT MEXICO AND THE U.S. WERE 
GOING TO HASH OUT THEIR 
DISAGREEMENTS AND THAT WOULD 
ALLOW CANADA TO COME BACK TO 
THE TABLE BECAUSE JUST FRIDAY 
THE CANADIAN FOREIGN MINISTER 
SAID THAT CANADA WOULD BE HAPPY 
TO REJOIN THE TALKS ONCE THE 
U.S. AND MEXICO WORKED OUT 
THEIR ISSUES, SO THAT WAS THIS 
MORNING. 
HERE WE ARE NOW WITH THE 
PRESIDENT SAYING HE WANTS TO 
GET RID OF THE NAME NAFTA 
BECAUSE IT HAS NEGATIVE 
CONNOTATIONS WITH IT. 
NOW, EVEN THOUGH THAT'S THE 
NAME OF THIS AGREEMENT, HE ALSO 
SAYS CANADA IS WELCOME TO JOIN 
IT. 
PERHAPS THEY WOULD BRING IN THE 
NAME CANADA AS WELL BUT THE 
PRESIDENT HAS MADE CLEAR THIS 
IS GOING TO BE DIFFERENT FROM 
NAFTA. 
AS YOU POINTED OUT, THE THREE-
WAY TALKS ALREADY DISSOLVED 
EARLIER THIS SUMMER, AND THEY 
REALLY IMPLODED WHEN VICE 
PRESIDENT MIKE PENCE SAID THAT 
THERE HAD TO BE A SUNSET CLAUSE 
IN A NEW NAFTA DEAL. 
NOW, THAT MEANS THAT, 
ESSENTIALLY, THE AGREEMENT 
WOULD EXPIRE ON ITS OWN IN FIVE 
YEARS AND THE PRIME MINISTER OF 
CANADA SAID ABSOLUTELY NOT. 
THERE'S NO REASON TO CONTINUE 
THESE TALKS BECAUSE WE WILL NOT 
AGREE TO SUCH A CLAUSE. 
AT THAT TIME THE PRESIDENT 
REALLY STARTED FOCUSING ON 
THESE BILATERAL AGREEMENTS WITH 
MEXICO AND WITH CANADA, AND 
THAT SORT OF WHERE WE ARE RIGHT 
NOW. 
HE SAYS THAT HE'S REACHED THIS 
DEAL WITH MEXICO AND NOW HE 
WILL START NEGOTIATIONS WITH 
CANADA. 
AS YOU ALSO POINTED OUT, THE 
PRESIDENT OF MEXICO HAS A VERY 
DIFFERENT TONE ON THE PHONE 
THAT WE JUST HEARD HIM ON 
SPEAKERPHONE IN THE OVAL 
OFFICE. 
>> HE SAID HE WANTED TO GIVE 
THE PRESIDENT A HUG. 
>> HE DID SAY THAT. 
PRESIDENT TRUMP SAID HE WOULD 
LOVE ONE FROM HIM AS WELL. 
IN TERMS OF THEIR TONE TOWARD 
CANADA, YOU KNOW, THE PRESIDENT 
REALLY LAID OUT THREE OPTIONS 
FOR THE PRIME MINISTER. 
YOU CAN EITHER HAVE A BILATERAL 
DEAL WITH US, YOU CAN COME JOIN 
THE STEEL, OR WE CAN TAX ALL OF 
YOUR CARS WITH TERRORISTS. 
NOW, ON THE OTHER HAND, HE'S 
VERY WELCOMING, ENCOURAGING 
CANADA. 
HE TWEETED THAT HE REALLY HOPES 
THAT JUSTIN TRUDEAU WILL JOIN 
AND THAT HE EVEN CALLED HIM 
THIS MORNING AFTER THIS 
ANNOUNCEMENT BETWEEN THE U.S. 
AND MEXICO. 
YOU KNOW, THIS IS NOT WHAT WE 
EXPECTED, RIGHT? 
WE EXPECTED THAT THEY WOULD 
JUST SORT OF AGREE TO TAKE ONE 
STEP FORWARD AGAIN SO THEY CAN 
FOCUS ON NAFTA, BUT CANADA ALSO 
RESPONDED. 
I SHOULD MENTION THAT THEY 
DELIVER THIS STATEMENT TO US 
BEFORE THE OVAL OFFICE 
ANNOUNCEMENT, AND THEY SAID 
THAT THEY ARE ENCOURAGED BY 
CONTINUED OPTIMISM THAT IS 
SHOWN BY OUR NEGOTIATING 
PARTNERS, BUT THEY MENTIONED 
MANY TIMES IN THIS STATEMENT 
THAT THEY WANTED TO WORK TOWARD 
A NEW NAFTA AGREEMENT, SO THEY 
ARE STILL CALLING IT NAFTA. 
THEY SAY, YOU KNOW, THEY WILL 
ONLY SIGN A NEW NAFTA DEAL THAT 
IS GOOD FOR CANADA AS WELL AND 
ENDED WITH SAYING CANADA'S 
SIGNATURE IS REQUIRED. 
BUT NOW YOU HAVE THE PRESIDENT 
SAYING, WE DON'T NEED NAFTA. 
WE DON'T NEED THREE COUNTRIES. 
I'M DOING THIS WITH MEXICO AND 
I CAN ALSO DO IT WITH CANADA 
ALONE. 
RIGHT NOW WE WILL JUST HAVE TO 
SEE HOW THIS PLAYS OUT BETWEEN 
THE U.S. AND CANADA. 
METAL GOODS. 
CANADA RESPONDED IN KIND AND 
THEN THERE WAS A REALLY WEIRD 
WAR OF WORDS WEIJA JIANG. 
>> Reporter: YES, WE WATCHED IT 
PLAY OUT ON TWITTER AND YOU 
MENTIONED THAT SUMMIT AND ALL 
OF THE PHOTO OPS, THEY WERE 
SHAKING HANDS, PRIME MINISTER 
TRUDEAU WELCOMED THE PRESIDENT 
TO CANADA, IT SEEMED LIKE HE 
WAS GOING TO JOIN THIS 
COMMUNIQUC BETWEEN ALL OF THE 
G7 NATIONS. 
EVEN THOUGH THERE WAS A TRADE 
DISPUTE GOING ON AT THE TIME 
WITH TARIFFS ON CANADA AND 
MEXICO AND THE EU, WHEN THE 
PRESIDENT LEFT THE SUMMIT IT 
SEEMED AS IF THEY HAD REACHED 
AN AGREEMENT TO CONTINUE 
NEGOTIATIONS IN GOOD FAITH. 
BUT THEN, ON THE PLANE, THE 
PRESIDENT HEARD PRIME MINISTER 
TRUDEAU'S PRESS CONFERENCE IN 
WHICH HE STRESSED THAT CANADA 
WOULD NOT BE BULLIED WHEN IT 
CAME TO TRADE DEALS, INCLUDING 
TARIFFS AND NAFTA. 
YOU ARE RIGHT, IT THEN IGNITED 
A WAR OF WORDS BETWEEN THESE 
TWO LEADERS THAT PLAYED OUT ON 
SOCIAL MEDIA WITH THE PRESIDENT 
SAYING, FORGET IT, I AM NOT 
SIGNING THIS COMMUNIQUC 
ON TOP OF THAT, I AM NOT 
BACKING DOWN ON THE TARIFFS. 
THAT TRIGGERED TARIFFS FROM 
CANADA AS WELL. 
THIS IS ALL HAPPENING PARALLEL 
TO THE NAFTA AGREEMENT THAT HAS 
BEEN IN THE WORKS THAT THEY 
HAVE BEEN TRYING TO HASH OUT 
FOR ONE YEAR NOW. 
CANADA HAS MADE CLEAR THAT THEY 
ARE WILLING TO TALK. THEY ARE 
HAPPY TO DO THAT, BUT THEY WILL 
NOT SIGN ANYTHING THAT THEY 
BELIEVE DOES NOT BENEFIT CANADA 
AS WELL. 
THERE HAS TO BE SOME COMMON 
GROUND BETWEEN WHAT THESE TWO 
COUNTRIES AGREE UPON.  
>>> RIGHT, LET'S NOT FORGET THE 
PRESIDENTS TRADE ADVISOR, PETER 
NAVARRO, SAYING THERE IS A 
SPECIAL PLACE IN HELL FOR 
FOREIGN LEADERS THAT ENGAGE IN 
BAD-FAITH DIPLOMACY. 
HE LATER APOLOGIZED FOR THAT 
PHRASING, BUT MANY PEOPLE WERE 
SORT OF SURPRISED BY THE 
NEGATIVE WORDS. WHEN AROUND 
THAT SAME TIME, PRESIDENT 
DONALD TRUMP WAS ALSO SORT OF 
THROWING A LOT OF PRAISE ON 
VLADIMIR PUTIN AND SOME OTHERS 
THAT WERE TYPICALLY LEADERS 
THAT DID NOT RECEIVE PRAISE 
FROM THE UNITED STATES. BUT 
BEFORE WE WRAP UP THIS 
CONVERSATION, WEIJA JIANG, I 
WANT TO TALK ABOUT, RIGHT AT 
THE END OF THAT PRESS 
CONFERENCE YOU COULD HEAR 
REPORTERS ASKING THE PRESIDENT 
WHETHER OR NOT HE WANTED TO 
MAKE A COMMENT ABOUT JOHN McCAIN
. I DO NOT KNOW IF HE DID NOT 
HEAR, BUT HE CERTAINLY DID NOT 
RESPOND. 
>> Reporter: RIGHT, WE HEARD 
THAT QUESTION SEVERAL TIMES AT 
THE END OF THE SORT OF PHOTO 
úO 
SEVERAL DIFFERENT TIMES 
REPORTERS ASKED, DO YOU HAVE 
ANYTHING TO SAY ABOUT THE LATE 
SENATOR? 
SO FAR THE ONLY THING THAT WE 
HAVE HEARD FROM PRESIDENT 
DONALD TRUMP IS VIA TWEET. 
HE DOES NOT SAY ANYTHING 
SPECIFICALLY ABOUT THE SENATOR 
OR PERSONALLY ABOUT HIM, HE 
DOES EXTEND HIS CONDOLENCES TO 
SENATOR McCAIN'S FAMILY. OF 
COURSE THESE TWO MEN HAVE A 
LONG HISTORY ABOUT LONG TENSE 
MOMENTS BETWEEN ONE ANOTHER. 
A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE WAITING AND 
EXPECTING THE PRESIDENT TO SAY 
SOMETHING GIVEN HOW THE SENATOR 
SERVED HIS COUNTRY BOTH IN THE 
MILITARY AND IN CONGRESS. 
BY THE WAY, I AM LOOKING RIGHT 
NOW, THE FLAGS HERE HAVE BEEN A 
SOURCE OF CONTROVERSY ALL 
MORNING BECAUSE THEY WERE 
LOWERED OVER THE WEEKEND HERE 
AT THE WHITE HOUSE TO PAY úTRIB 
THIS MORNING THEY WERE RAISED 
BACK TO FULL STAFF. 
THAT DOES NOT MEAN THAT THE 
PRESIDENT ORDERED THEM TO BE 
RAISED, BUT IT DOES MEAN THAT 
HE DID NOT ORDER THEM TO REMAIN 
LOWERED. 
HE COULD'VE DONE THAT THROUGH A 
PRESIDENTIAL PROCLAMATION WHICH 
IS TRADITIONAL IN A CASE LIKE 
THIS TO KEEP THE FLAGS AT HALF 
STAFF UNTIL THE SENATOR IS 
BURIED WHICH DOES NOT HAPPEN 
UNTIL SUNDAY. 
AND SO, WE ARE NOT ONLY WAITING 
TO SEE IF THE PRESIDENT HAS 
ANYTHING TO SAY ABOUT THE 
SENATOR'S SERVICE, BUT ALSO 
ANYTHING TO SAY ABOUT THIS 
DECISION NOT TO EXTEND THAT 
PROCLAMATION WHICH MANY CRITICS 
FROM BOTH SIDES ARE NOW 
DEMANDING THAT HE DO THAT JUST 
TO PAY ONE FINAL NOD TO SENATOR 
McCAIN WHO HAS DONE SO MUCH FOR 
THIS COUNTRY. 
SO FAR HE HAS NOT TAKEN THE 
OPPORTUNITY TO EXPLAIN EITHER 
WHEN HE JUST SPOKE.  
>> YES, THERE ARE REPORTS THAT 
HE DECIDED DELIBERATELY NOT TO 
ISSUE AN OFFICIAL WHITE HOUSE 
STATEMENT ON THE PASSING OF 
JOHN McCAIN, INSTEAD CHOOSING 
THIS TWEET WHICH YOU RIGHTLY 
POINTED OUT EXTENDS SYMPATHIES 
TO HIS FAMILY, BUT NOTHING 
ABOUT THE GREAT SERVICE 
PROVIDED BY JOHN McCAIN 
THROUGHOUT HIS DECADES AND 
DECADES OF SERVICE IN 
WASHINGTON AND ALSO MILITARY 
SERVICE. 
WE WILL SEE, HE STILL HAS TIME 
TO MAKE A COMMENT. 
>> Reporter: HE HAS TIME, BUT 
ANNE-MARIE, I WANT TO POINT 
OUT, LET'S SAY THAT HE HAD 
ISSUED A STATEMENT, PART OF THE 
CONVERSATION WOULD BE, HOW 
SINCERE IS THIS STATEMENT? 
THEY REALLY DO HAVE A LONG 
HISTORY OF PRETTY HARSH WORDS 
AGAINST ONE ANOTHER. 
JUST A COUPLE OF WEEKS AGO, THE 
PRESIDENT NOT BY NAME MENTIONED 
SENATOR McCAIN WHEN HE WAS 
TALKING ABOUT REPEALING OBAMA 
CARE WHICH DID NOT HAPPEN 
BECAUSE OF McCAIN'S VOTE THAT 
WAS TONS DOWN ON THE SENATE 
FLOOR -- THUMBS DOWN ON THE 
SENATE FLOOR. 
SO THE PRESIDENT'S YOU KNOW 
DEFINITELY -- THE PRESIDENT, 
YOU KNOW, DEFTLY HAS SPOKEN A 
LOT ABOUT HOW HE BELIEVES THE 
SENATOR DISAPPOINTED THE PARTY 
AND AMERICANS. 
McCAIN DID NOT CARE, HE STOOD 
BY HIS BELIEFS AND HAD HARSH 
WORDS FOR THE PRESIDENT AS 
WELL. 
THERE IS NO LOVE LOST, SO IF 
THE PRESIDENT HAD ISSUED A 
STATEMENT WITH VERY KIND WORDS 
FOR McCAIN, PERHAPS THE 
CRITICISM THEN WOULD BE DOES HE 
MEAN IT? 
IT IS HARD TO TELL, WHAT WE DO 
 
STATEMENT, AT LEAST SO FAR FROM 
THE PRESIDENT.  
>>> GOOD POINTS, WEIJA JIANG, 
THANKS SO MUCH. 
>> Reporter: SURE, THANKS.  
>> WE WILL TAKE A QUICK BREAK, 
WE HAVE A LOT MORE NEWS AHEAD, 
THIS IS CBSN. 
>>>
