1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,770
just in Sarah Palin hospitalized
Bill Clinton loses it an interview

2
00:00:04,770 --> 00:00:08,670
admits as a murderer if this that makes
you want to click fake news dominated

3
00:00:08,670 --> 00:00:14,969
the 2016 US election we have an epidemic
of false information racing around using

4
00:00:14,969 --> 00:00:21,600
social networks as the accelerator one
city in Macedonia was at the very center

5
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:26,279
of it
this is Valles two years I was earning

6
00:00:26,279 --> 00:00:30,810
more than someone that will never run in
this entire life and these other people

7
00:00:30,810 --> 00:00:36,630
behind it it's a huge business it's a
huge industry it's a huge Network we are

8
00:00:36,630 --> 00:00:41,850
taking account so I can reach more and
more people there is a strategy there's

9
00:00:41,850 --> 00:00:46,200
a cleverness to this you don't know if
it's filled eyes on law and I don't care

10
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:51,440
and one fake news producer makes a
shocking revelation their next target

11
00:00:51,440 --> 00:01:09,150
20/20 tucked away in the hills of the
Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia is

12
00:01:09,150 --> 00:01:14,640
the small city of Ellis
to place many thousands of miles away

13
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:19,350
from Washington but whose voices echo
right across America so-called fake news

14
00:01:19,350 --> 00:01:27,479
can have real world fighting the fake
news it's fake for months I've been

15
00:01:27,479 --> 00:01:32,009
wanting to come here ever since I heard
over a hundred fake news sites were

16
00:01:32,009 --> 00:01:37,440
trace right here to the city the old
factories here in Veles many now left to

17
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:43,170
rust away used to make ceramics today
it's known locally for something else

18
00:01:43,170 --> 00:01:52,640
now it's known as Trump's palace famous
for its fake news websites

19
00:01:55,930 --> 00:02:02,560
I keep hearing the fake news industry is
worth millions of dollars for walking

20
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:08,649
around it's clear to see this is not a
city paved with gold in fact it's a

21
00:02:08,649 --> 00:02:12,420
place that feels like it's trapped in a
time warp while it simultaneously

22
00:02:12,420 --> 00:02:17,130
charges ahead into the digital new world

23
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:22,810
so it makes me wonder who are the people
behind this supposedly multi-million

24
00:02:22,810 --> 00:02:28,209
dollar industry what are the chances of
us getting someone to interview can you

25
00:02:28,209 --> 00:02:32,770
help us never run the greatest we find
several people in the city connected to

26
00:02:32,770 --> 00:02:38,020
the fake news industry but they're
reluctant to talk openly about it will

27
00:02:38,020 --> 00:02:43,709
any other people you know the interested
in talking to us be able to talk to us

28
00:02:43,709 --> 00:02:49,510
they are worried about being exposed and
their websites shut down this after

29
00:02:49,510 --> 00:02:53,569
Facebook and Google began cracking down
on fake news

30
00:02:53,569 --> 00:02:57,920
but it seemed the local mayor isn't shy
to tell us just how widespread the

31
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:09,829
industry is Tony Bravo Tara rush
Americans consistent press machines are

32
00:03:09,829 --> 00:03:12,549
about being on the path

33
00:03:14,450 --> 00:03:21,510
about seven tabs or so there are open
just in Sarah Palin hospitalized from

34
00:03:21,510 --> 00:03:27,540
spot the stories that are really untrue
completely fake Bill Clinton loses it an

35
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:31,080
interview admit is a murder of the
stories on this particular website a

36
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:35,970
fake but other websites are actually
going further they are mixing fact and

37
00:03:35,970 --> 00:03:41,220
fiction that is a lie and that's mixed
in with News and the main political page

38
00:03:41,220 --> 00:03:46,890
and someone in the US could potentially
be influenced by that they make you

39
00:03:46,890 --> 00:03:53,610
wanna click and they make you want to
share at the moment we're looking to

40
00:03:53,610 --> 00:03:57,930
track down some of the websites
currently up and running we want to know

41
00:03:57,930 --> 00:04:03,180
what exactly they're writing about is a
store President Trump this is the one of

42
00:04:03,180 --> 00:04:07,890
the websites that we know comes from
Macedonia it has a link to their own

43
00:04:07,890 --> 00:04:13,110
Facebook the IP address and the IP
location says it's Texas if you look

44
00:04:13,110 --> 00:04:18,930
further down it gives you the address
Bellus I'm gonna see if this person digs

45
00:04:18,930 --> 00:04:30,330
up hello can you tell me a bit more
about your website would you call it a

46
00:04:30,330 --> 00:04:35,880
fake news website where do you get your
ideas from where do you get the stories

47
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:43,380
from and who are your readers is it
American readers who are the majority of

48
00:04:43,380 --> 00:04:49,650
people yeah do the people that read your
websites do they know that your website

49
00:04:49,650 --> 00:05:05,310
is fake well they're not real news
you're making stories up copy and paste

50
00:05:05,310 --> 00:05:15,290
or do you write your own stories is
there any chance that we can meet

51
00:05:15,290 --> 00:05:20,340
alright thank you very much thank you
Joe so that that was interesting I

52
00:05:20,340 --> 00:05:23,930
wasn't expecting him to pick up the
phone in fact I was expecting it to be a

53
00:05:23,930 --> 00:05:30,630
fake number he doesn't
he's doing anything wrong but yet again

54
00:05:30,630 --> 00:05:35,590
doesn't want his face or his name to
appear as you can see there we're not

55
00:05:35,590 --> 00:05:39,100
talking about three four people 100
people is a hundred and twenty four

56
00:05:39,100 --> 00:05:45,610
thousand people who like his stories
website owners make their money from

57
00:05:45,610 --> 00:05:51,790
advertising platforms like Google's
absence place ads on their sites every

58
00:05:51,790 --> 00:05:56,170
page visit earns a fraction of a cent
third as you can imagine it quickly adds

59
00:05:56,170 --> 00:06:01,420
up with hundreds of thousands of clicks
then to drive traffic fake news

60
00:06:01,420 --> 00:06:06,340
producers use Facebook they post links
to their stories in fan groups often on

61
00:06:06,340 --> 00:06:10,890
the fake profiles all in the hope that
they will go viral

62
00:06:10,890 --> 00:06:15,580
we spoke to Facebook and Google who told
us they are actively identifying and

63
00:06:15,580 --> 00:06:20,140
blocking accounts linked to fake news
but on the ground producers are adapting

64
00:06:20,140 --> 00:06:25,510
as we learned after chance encounter
with some producers at a cafe they

65
00:06:25,510 --> 00:06:30,310
didn't want appear on camera
how many facebook profiles do have to

66
00:06:30,310 --> 00:06:34,020
create in order to get your message out

67
00:06:35,449 --> 00:06:44,370
by yourself yeah so how do you how do
you get around that go by real profiles

68
00:06:44,370 --> 00:06:48,919
yeah some kids then we change

69
00:06:49,980 --> 00:06:58,660
real profiles exist and they just change
into American names teenagers like to

70
00:06:58,660 --> 00:07:07,480
euros before despite the breakthrough we
got a sense that everyone in this town

71
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:13,090
was protecting each other but just when
we thought our story was going to end

72
00:07:13,090 --> 00:07:20,590

produces fake news websites wants to

have maybe a fanpage more than half a
million million people what makes a good

94
00:09:31,070 --> 00:09:36,140
clickable story in your opinion so you
need to have an interesting topic

00:09:36,140 --> 00:09:39,490
whatever Donald Trump is doing it's
interesting for everyone

96
00:09:39,490 --> 00:09:44,199
even in my country everything he said
it's worth listening you know he's an

97
00:09:44,199 --> 00:09:51,249
interesting face when you have million
fans if you post something even if it's

98
00:09:51,249 --> 00:09:54,970
not interesting a lot of them will open
it just to see what it is and you will

you've achieved in 22 years I was
earning more than someone that will

102
00:10:08,350 --> 00:10:12,670
never run in his entire life
with the standard that we have in my

103
00:10:12,670 --> 00:10:18,189
country so yes I'm proud you know if you
try and put yourself in his shoes he

104
00:10:18,189 --> 00:10:22,179
wanted to be a lawyer had dreams have
big dreams like any one of us but he

105
00:10:22,179 --> 00:10:27,670
said well why would I even spend years
studying when I can basically make three

106
00:10:27,670 --> 00:10:36,670
four times that he is focusing on the
next big story is preparing his website

107
00:10:36,670 --> 00:10:41,910
for the next big story in the next big
story for him the next u.s. elections

108
00:10:41,910 --> 00:10:47,199
it's not just him the had a computer
there are people who write stories for

109
00:10:47,199 --> 00:10:51,939
him people in the US who he depends on
it's a huge business it's a huge

110
00:10:51,939 --> 00:10:56,649
industry it's a huge Network and he's
just one of hundreds working out of

111
00:10:56,649 --> 00:10:58,889
Ellis

112
00:11:05,529 --> 00:11:10,190
meeting Mikkel has given us a window
into the fake news industry in Velas but

113
00:11:10,190 --> 00:11:16,190
we know this goes far beyond him later
we bump into the mayor at the opening of

114
00:11:16,190 --> 00:11:24,709
any bar here the alcohol is flowing and
the money's quite literally as local

115
00:11:24,709 --> 00:11:31,430
tradition dictates being thrown around
this is what the digital gold rush looks

116
00:11:31,430 --> 00:11:33,640
like

117
00:11:48,330 --> 00:11:54,120
young fake media producers have put
vellus on the map on the world map are

118
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:59,990
you proud of that doc real walk was guru
monastic we grabs a cup of awareness

119
00:11:59,990 --> 00:12:05,790
Naruto Alicia dick need and suck on the
Republican a colonial implication it may

120
00:12:05,790 --> 00:12:10,880
be legal but is it morally right my
motto

121
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:18,990
tickets anymore is there a big apology
behind these guys who's influencing them

122
00:12:18,990 --> 00:12:25,910
to influence the u.s. election yeah
music awesome all new products

123
00:12:28,550 --> 00:12:35,779
I almost understand why they're doing it
high unemployment very little

124
00:12:35,779 --> 00:12:41,510
opportunities here in the city you take
a step back and you look at what they've

125
00:12:41,510 --> 00:12:46,519
created and how they've managed to
sustain it there is a strategy there's a

126
00:12:46,519 --> 00:12:51,769
cleverness to this I think what they
doing is plagiarizing I think they're

127
00:12:51,769 --> 00:13:00,470
frauds but are we to blame this partly
so as long as people in the United

128
00:13:00,470 --> 00:13:07,970
States keep engaging keep clicking keep
sharing keep liking these guys will be

129
00:13:07,970 --> 00:00:00,000
in business
