1
00:00:00,485 --> 00:00:02,154
ABOUT OUR FAMILY.

2
00:00:02,154 --> 00:00:06,291
WE'RE PROUD OF OTTO AND MISS

3
00:00:06,291 --> 00:00:06,992
HIM.

4
00:00:06,992 --> 00:00:09,227
HOPEFULLY SOMETHING POSITIVE CAN

5
00:00:09,227 --> 00:00:11,229
COME FROM THIS."

6
00:00:11,229 --> 00:00:15,200
AND WE HAVE AMBASSADOR HERE WITH

7
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:18,804
US TO GIVE US THOUGHTS ABOUT THE

8
00:00:18,937 --> 00:00:21,273
I KNOW THE PRESIDENT HAD TO USE

9
00:00:21,273 --> 00:00:22,707
SOME FLATTERY.

10
00:00:22,707 --> 00:00:26,011
WAS THAT NECESSARY TO GET THE

11
00:00:26,011 --> 00:00:26,812
DIPLOMACY GOING?

12
00:00:26,812 --> 00:00:28,547
>> PERHAPS A LITTLE FLATTERY CAN

13
00:00:28,547 --> 00:00:31,116
GO A LONG WAY.

14
00:00:31,116 --> 00:00:32,350
I THINK THE OVERALL ATMOSPHERE

15
00:00:32,350 --> 00:00:34,686
OF THIS MEETING WAS POSITIVE.

16
00:00:34,686 --> 00:00:37,189
THAT'S GOING TO HELP CREATE A

17
00:00:37,189 --> 00:00:39,991
FAVORABLE FRAME WORK FOR TALKS.

18
00:00:39,991 --> 00:00:40,342
I'M DIS APPOINT

19
00:00:40,342 --> 00:00:40,859
I'M DIS APPOIN

20
00:00:40,859 --> 00:00:40,892
I'M DISAPPPOIN

21
00:00:40,892 --> 00:00:40,926
I'M DISAPPOOIN

22
00:00:40,926 --> 00:00:40,959
I'M DISAPPOINN

23
00:00:40,959 --> 00:00:40,992
I'M DISAPPOINT

24
00:00:40,992 --> 00:00:43,195
I'M DISAPPOINTED

25
00:00:43,195 --> 00:00:43,228
I'M DISAPPOINTED A

26
00:00:43,228 --> 00:00:43,261
I'M DISAPPOINTED ABO

27
00:00:43,261 --> 00:00:43,461
I'M DISAPPOINTED ABOUT

28
00:00:43,461 --> 00:00:43,495
I'M DISAPPOINTED ABOUT T

29
00:00:43,495 --> 00:00:44,262
I'M DISAPPOINTED ABOUT THE

30
00:00:44,262 --> 00:00:44,663
SUBSTANCE.

31
00:00:44,663 --> 00:00:46,531
THE STATEMENTS DIDN'T ADVANCE

32
00:00:46,531 --> 00:00:48,733
THE BALL AT ALL DOWN THE FIELD

33
00:00:48,733 --> 00:00:49,901
ON DENUCLEARIZATION.

34
00:00:49,901 --> 00:00:52,537
THE LANGUAGE IS WEAKER THAN THE

35
00:00:52,537 --> 00:00:54,272
AGREEMENTS THAT THE BUSH

36
00:00:54,272 --> 00:00:55,740
ADMINISTRATION HAD REACHED IN

37
00:00:55,740 --> 00:00:56,041
2005.

38
00:00:56,041 --> 00:00:57,509
SO WE DON'T KNOW ABOUT THE

39
00:00:57,509 --> 00:00:59,177
SCOPE, DON'T KNOW ABOUT THE

40
00:00:59,177 --> 00:01:01,079
TIMING OR WHETHER THERE WILL BE

41
00:01:01,079 --> 00:01:02,214
ANY VERIFICATION.

42
00:01:02,214 --> 00:01:03,748
>> Sandra: DO YOU THINK --

43
00:01:03,748 --> 00:01:05,183
>> WE COULD HAVE GOTTEN MORE.

44
00:01:05,183 --> 00:01:06,084
>> Sandra: YOU THINK THIS IS

45
00:01:06,084 --> 00:01:07,352
JUST BECAUSE THE FIRST MEETING

46
00:01:07,352 --> 00:01:10,155
AND IT WAS A CHANCE TO ESTABLISH

47
00:01:10,155 --> 00:01:11,590
A RELATIONSHIP?

48
00:01:11,590 --> 00:01:14,593
I KNOW SECRETARY POMPEO AND JOHN

49
00:01:14,593 --> 00:01:16,061
BOLTON, NOT KNOWN TO BE DUBS,

50
00:01:16,061 --> 00:01:18,763
WILL BE GOING TO NORTH KOREA AND

51
00:01:18,763 --> 00:01:20,332
THIS PROVIDES THEM NOW A CHANCE

52
00:01:20,332 --> 00:01:21,867
TO SAY ALL RIGHT, WE'RE GOING TO

53
00:01:21,867 --> 00:01:24,436
PUT YOU TO THE TEST NOW WITH

54
00:01:24,436 --> 00:01:25,770
SOME MORE SPECIFICS?

55
00:01:25,770 --> 00:01:27,005
>> THAT'S WHERE WE ARE.

56
00:01:27,005 --> 00:01:29,107
IT'S GOOD THAT POMPEO WILL BE

57
00:01:29,107 --> 00:01:29,674
LEADING THE TALKS.

58
00:01:29,674 --> 00:01:31,543
HE'S ALREADY IMMERSED IN THE

59
00:01:31,543 --> 00:01:31,877
SUBJECT.

60
00:01:31,877 --> 00:01:34,446
HE KNOWS WHAT IS AT STAKE.

61
00:01:34,446 --> 00:01:36,848
IT'S A VERY STEEP HILL TO CLIMB,

62
00:01:36,848 --> 00:01:37,916
PARTICULARLY WHEN THE NORTH

63
00:01:37,916 --> 00:01:39,451
KOREANS -- DESPITE ALL THE

64
00:01:39,451 --> 00:01:40,418
POLITICAL GAINS THAT THEY GOT

65
00:01:40,418 --> 00:01:42,287
FROM THE MEETING, JUST MEETING

66
00:01:42,287 --> 00:01:44,389
WITH THE PRESIDENT ITSELF IS A

67
00:01:44,389 --> 00:01:46,391
BIG GAIN, BOOST THEIR STATUS IN

68
00:01:46,391 --> 00:01:47,726
THE WORLD, LOOKS LIKE WE'RE

69
00:01:47,726 --> 00:01:50,228
ALMOST RECOGNIZING THEM AS A

70
00:01:50,228 --> 00:01:51,563
NUCLEAR POWER, THEY COULD HAVE

71
00:01:51,563 --> 00:01:52,230
GIVEN US MORE.

72
00:01:52,230 --> 00:01:53,999
NOW WE HAVE TO PUT THEM TO THE

73
00:01:53,999 --> 00:01:55,066
TEST EARLY.

74
00:01:55,066 --> 00:01:57,569
WE HAVE TO THINK OF EARLY TESTS

75
00:01:57,569 --> 00:02:01,139
THAT WOULD INVOLVE DISMANTLING,

76
00:02:01,139 --> 00:02:01,640
WAR HEADS.

77
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:03,909
THAT CUT INTO THEIR CAPABILITY

78
00:02:03,909 --> 00:02:05,610
TO THREATEN US.

79
00:02:05,610 --> 00:02:07,679
>> Sandra: CAN I HAVE YOU LISTEN

80
00:02:07,679 --> 00:02:12,484
TO SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM ON THE

81
00:02:12,484 --> 00:02:15,587
GOAL GOING FORWARD.

82
00:02:15,587 --> 00:02:15,921
LISTEN.

83
00:02:15,921 --> 00:02:17,322
>> WE'RE TALKING ABOUT A

84
00:02:17,322 --> 00:02:18,356
COMPLETE THUG AND KILLER.

85
00:02:18,356 --> 00:02:19,758
I HAVE NO ILLUSIONS.

86
00:02:19,758 --> 00:02:21,092
HE'S NOT A NICE MAN.

87
00:02:21,092 --> 00:02:23,028
BUT HE WILL DO WHAT IS BEST FOR

88
00:02:23,028 --> 00:02:24,796
HIM AND HIS INNER CIRCLE.

89
00:02:24,796 --> 00:02:26,798
TRUMP HAS TO CONVINCE HIM THAT

90
00:02:26,798 --> 00:02:28,934
YOU'LL BE SAFER AND MORE

91
00:02:28,934 --> 00:02:31,236
PROSPEROUS BY GIVING UP YOUR

92
00:02:31,236 --> 00:02:32,771
NUKES IF YOU KEEP THEM.

93
00:02:32,771 --> 00:02:35,307
IT'S ABOUT KIM AND HIS REGIME.

94
00:02:35,307 --> 00:02:36,741
IT'S NOT ABOUT THE PEOPLE.

95
00:02:36,741 --> 00:02:39,177
>> Sandra: AMBASSADOR, BASED ON

96
00:02:39,177 --> 00:02:41,413
YOUR EXPERTISE, I WONDER WHAT

97
00:02:41,413 --> 00:02:42,814
YOU THOUGHT ABOUT THE IDEA THAT

98
00:02:42,814 --> 00:02:44,182
PRESIDENT MOON HAD BEEN

99
00:02:44,182 --> 00:02:46,084
INSTRUMENTAL IN MENTORING AND

100
00:02:46,084 --> 00:02:47,319
ADVISING MOON BEFORE THE MEETING

101
00:02:47,319 --> 00:02:48,920
AND DID THE SOUTH KOREANS END UP

102
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:51,690
WITH MORE OR LESS THAN THEY

103
00:02:51,690 --> 00:02:54,492
THOUGHT THEY WOULD?

104
00:02:54,492 --> 00:02:56,094
>> WELL, I HAVEN'T HEARD WHAT

105
00:02:56,094 --> 00:02:57,228
PRESIDENT MOON SAID.

106
00:02:57,228 --> 00:02:59,998
THEY WERE DISAPPOINTED THERE WAS

107
00:02:59,998 --> 00:03:03,668
NOT A SMALL STEP FORWARD ON

108
00:03:03,668 --> 00:03:04,169
DENUCLEARIZATION.

109
00:03:04,169 --> 00:03:05,937
WHAT IS WORRISOME TO THE SOUTH,

110
00:03:05,937 --> 00:03:07,405
THE ANNOUNCEMENT WITHOUT

111
00:03:07,405 --> 00:03:09,674
COORDINATING WITH THE SOUTH

112
00:03:09,674 --> 00:03:11,309
KOREANS OR WITH THE PENTAGON

113
00:03:11,309 --> 00:03:13,345
THAT HE'S GOING TO SUSPEND THE

114
00:03:13,345 --> 00:03:15,714
MILITARY EXERCISES, WHICH ARE

115
00:03:15,714 --> 00:03:18,650
CRITICAL FOR KEEPING FORCES AT A

116
00:03:18,650 --> 00:03:20,752
HIGH LEVEL OF READINESS SO THAT

117
00:03:20,752 --> 00:03:22,620
WE CAN GO INTO ACTION IF THERE'S

118
00:03:22,620 --> 00:03:25,223
A NORTH KOREAN AGGRESSION.

119
00:03:25,223 --> 00:03:27,492
SO THAT I THINK SQUANDERED SOME

120
00:03:27,492 --> 00:03:29,661
OF OUR LEVERAGE THAT POMPEO WILL

121
00:03:29,661 --> 00:03:32,030
HEAD AND I HOPE IT DOESN'T

122
00:03:32,030 --> 00:03:34,899
UNDERMINE THE CHANCES OF GETTING

123
00:03:34,899 --> 00:03:36,568
REAL DENUCLEARIZATION.

124
00:03:36,568 --> 00:03:37,435
>> Sandra: IN THE BRIEFING

125
00:03:37,435 --> 00:03:38,670
BEFORE THE SUMMIT, MIKE POMPEO

126
00:03:38,670 --> 00:03:40,171
SAID HE BELIEVES WE'RE ON THE

127
00:03:40,171 --> 00:03:42,173
SAME PAGE AND UNDERSTAND AND

128
00:03:42,173 --> 00:03:43,408
HAVE THE SAME DEFINITION OF

129
00:03:43,408 --> 00:03:45,810
DENUCLEARIZATION AS THE NORTH

130
00:03:45,810 --> 00:03:46,177
KOREANS.

131
00:03:46,177 --> 00:03:47,545
DO YOU THINK THAT IS TRUE?

132
00:03:47,545 --> 00:03:49,280
>> I'M NOT YET CONVINCED OF

133
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:49,814
THAT.

134
00:03:49,814 --> 00:03:51,950
HE MAY HAVE HEARD THINGS IN

135
00:03:51,950 --> 00:03:53,551
PRIVATE THAT GO WELL BEYOND THIS

136
00:03:53,551 --> 00:03:54,252
JOINT STATEMENT.

137
00:03:54,252 --> 00:03:56,755
BUT AT THE MOMENT, WE HAVE TO

138
00:03:56,755 --> 00:03:58,490
ASSUME THEIR PREVIOUS POSITIONS

139
00:03:58,490 --> 00:03:59,958
STILL HOLD AND THEY'RE NOT READY

140
00:03:59,958 --> 00:04:03,828
NOR THE VERY INTRUSIVE THAT IS

141
00:04:03,828 --> 00:04:06,064
NEEDED FOR THE INVENTORY AND

142
00:04:06,064 --> 00:04:07,565
WITNESS THE SYSTEMATIC

143
00:04:07,565 --> 00:04:14,339
DISMANTLING OF THE MISSILES, THE

144
00:04:14,339 --> 00:04:17,875
NUCLEAR REACTORS, ET CETERA.

145
00:04:17,875 --> 00:04:19,144
I HOPE I'M WRONG.

146
00:04:19,144 --> 00:00:00,000
HE'S GOTTEN THE MESSAGE BUT HE'S
