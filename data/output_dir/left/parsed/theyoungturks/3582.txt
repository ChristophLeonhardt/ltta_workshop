PEOPLE WITH MONEY ARE SPENDING
$36 AN HOUR TO STRETCH.
WE ARE NOT TALKING ABOUT YOGA,
BUT THIS NEW WORK OUT THING
THAT'S HAPPENING IN THE COUNTRY
WHERE PEOPLE WHO REFER
THEMSELVES AS FLEXOLOGISTS WILL
STRETCH YOU.
LET ME GIVE YOU MORE DETAILS.
ANOTHER EXAMPLE IS A COMPANY
CALLED STRETCH ZONE.
JUST GO TO A 
YOGA CLASS AND SHUT
UP.
I'M BEING TOO NEGATIVE I FEEL.
BUT $36 AN HOUR?
>> I WANT TO MAKE SURE WE DO
OR JOURNALISM RIGHT,
$36 FOR HALF AN HOUR.
>> THAT I MISREAD IT?
>>YES.
>> OH MY GOD, HE'S RIGHT.
>> WHEN I WAS A LAW STUDENT I
WAS SO PSYCHED WHEN I GOT MY
FIRST PART-TIME LAWN JOB
BECAUSE IT PAID A NUMBER I HAD
NEVER SEEN IN MY LIFE BEFORE,
$25 AN HOUR.
I REMEMBER MY DAD USED TO PAY
ME TWO DOLLARS AN HOUR IN
CONSTRUCTION.
I THOUGHT I WAS RICH, THIS IS
$72 AN HOUR FOR STRETCHING.
>>THAT'S THE THING, PEOPLE PAY
FOR ANYTHING TO MAKE THEMSELVES
FEEL GOOD OR CONVINCE
THEMSELVES.
THE REALITY IS YOU CAN STRETCH
ON YOUR OWN.
FITNESS EXPERTS SAY THE BENEFITS
OF STRETCHING ARE OVERBLOWN.
I DON'T KNOW, I'M NOT A FITNESS
EXPERT.
THE POINT IS THERE ARE PEOPLE
OUT THERE THAT WANT TO RIP
YOU OFF.
AGAIN I FEEL LIKE I'M BEING TOO
MEAN TO THESE PEOPLE AND I
DON'T MEAN TO.
BUT YOU ARE RIPPING
PEOPLE OFF DUDE,
$36 FOR A HALF HOUR OF
STRETCHING?
>>IF PEOPLE WANT TO PAY BLESS
THEIR HEARTS.
AT THE SAME TIME DON'T.
I KNOW WHAT THE BENEFITS ARE.
I 
HAVE BEEN STRETCHING MY WHOLE
LIFE, BUT I KNOW THAT MY BODY
DOESN'T SHOW IT.
I OBVIOUSLY DON'T HAVE THE
BODY TYPE FOR IT BUT I DO
EXERCISE FOUR TIMES A WEEK
ROUGHLY AND I HAVE FOR DECADES.
STRETCHING IS GREAT.
JUST THIS WEEK BEFORE I READ
THE STORY I WAS THINKING OF
WHAT ARE THE UPSIDES OF ME
DOING EXERCISE SO MUCH?
I SAID I ALSO GET TO STRETCH AND
IT HELPS YOUR BODY.
IF YOU DON'T EXERCISE AND DON'T
STRETCH IT IS A BAD IDEA.
BUT IF ALL YOU DO IS STRETCH
LIKE THIS ñ AND THEN YOU GO BACK
AND SIT ON THE COUCH ñ
>>I KNOW.
ONE PERSON WHO TAKES THESE
CLASSES SAYS AFTER DOING THESE
STRETCHING CLASSES THAT WHEN HE
GOES TO SLEEP AT NIGHT HE FEELS
LIKE HE WENT FOR ROUNDS WITH
MIKE TYSON.
>>NO YOU DIDN'T.
STRETCHING ISN'T EXCELLENT START
TO YOUR EXERCISE.
BUT YOU ACTUALLY HAVE TO KEEP
GOING.
AS YOU CAN TELL I AM NOT AN
EXERCISE NOT EITHER.
WHEN I FIRST STARTED EXERCISING
I WALKED FOR A QUARTER OF A
MILE AND THOUGHT I AM DONE.
>>YOU HAVE TO START SLOW.
>> IF YOU WANT TO START WITH
STRETCHING, BLESS YOUR
HEART, BUT THEN KEEP IT GOING.
