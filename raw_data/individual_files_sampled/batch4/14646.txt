the US Supreme Court has just given individual states the right to entertain single game sports bets something that will generate billions of dollars in new revenue how much do you want to bet that Canada's federal government will continue to screw up the sports wagering file on this side of the border earlier this month in a 6 to 3 vote the US Supreme Court struck down the professional and amateur sports Protection Act of 1992 translation whereas Nevada used to be the only state where one could place a legal bet on a sporting event now all states can take part already 18 states have introduced legislation to legalize sports wagering more are expected to follow The Supremes made a good and just decision here if people want to place a bet on the Super Bowl they should be free to do so without having to set up an offshore account or dealing with Vinny on pier 5 sports wagering has been going on since the very inception of sports and declaring such wagering illegal only fuels the gray and black markets so what does this decision mean for Canada well it means a lot because in our great Dominion sports wagering has been legal at all the provincial lottery corporations for decades but under the Criminal Code a better has the wager on at least two games at a time single game wagers are not permitted even though betting on one game at a time is by far the most popular way people like to bet this restriction is inexplicable it's as though the government just wants to be a little bit pregnant when it comes to sports gambling and what is the result well if you're like me and untold thousands of Canadians you simply open an account with a offshore betting service such as bet365 dot-com based out of the UK apparently the Canadian government is unaware of this little communications conveyance called the Internet all one needs a day to place a single-game bet is a valid credit card and hey if the government won't let me bent legally here in Ontario and it wants to surrender all this moolah to foreign entities then well so be it but the money drain will only worsen when American border casinos offer sports books to entertain single game bets so it is for example that southern antarians will simply shuffle off to casinos in Buffalo or Niagara Falls New York in order to place their single game wagers and hey while they're there they may as well play the slots and table games money by the way that would have been spent in a Canadian casino if such a Canadian casino allowed single game sports betting but here's the added tragedy in 2012 the NDP sponsored a private member's bill that would have allowed single sports wagers in Canada and get this this bill was approved by all federal political parties but the Senate apparently concerned that Canadians would bet the milk money on football games stalled the legislation until the 2015 federal election was called which meant that Bill see 290 died on the order table it was one of the most despicable examples of nanny state ISM carried out by our unelected and non-accountable Senate but the plot thickens because last year the NDP reintroduced this bill alas this bill is doomed because the Liberals who supported bill C 290 when they were in opposition six years ago are now inexplicably opposed a single event sports wagering that's weird all which means billions and billions of dollars of Canadian wagers will continue to migrate over the border and offshore she you'd think that Justin Trudeau would support a new source of revenue for the nation after all he has so many schemes that need to be financed such as migrant resettlement but I guess when you're a trust-fund millionaire who has barely worked a day in the real world you live in an economic bubble after all the budget it's gonna balance itself don't you know for the rebel dot media I'm David the men's I'd Menzies hey folks do we have a super event plan for Saturday June the 2nd in Toronto it's our second annual rebel live we have Katie Hopkins Sheila Gunn read the big bossman Israel event John card ello so many others go to the rebel live.com get your tickets today don't you dare miss it you
