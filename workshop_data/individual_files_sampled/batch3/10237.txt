it's been confirmed that American soldiers are directly helping Saudi Arabia protect his border with Yemen Pentagon news briefing on Thursday admitted that troops were now active there in rolls the statements in contradiction than with previous comments in which officials said that the u.s. is only helping the Saudis with aircraft refueling logistics and general intelligence sharing but do support the saudi-led coalition with intelligence sharing military advice and logistical support priority is the fight against Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula and Isis in Yemen the extent of our support is refueling and sharing Intel well mixed messages anyway let's try and get to the bottom of it let's go live to Washington our DC correspondent Samira Khan hey Samira so where does Washington stand at this point is it boots on the ground or they simply helping what's the message well up until now most believe that US military assistance to the Saudis in Yemen was limited to intelligence logistics and aircraft refueling and that was according to official Pentagon statements but this latest development contradicts that so far what we do know is that a team of a few Green Berets apparently arrived on the Saudi and many board sometime last year and according to the Pentagon they've only been there to protect the border but reports suggest that they've been actively involved on the southeast side helping them destroy Houthi ballistic missile launch sites and the it's worth mentioning that even though this war has been going on for a few years Saudi Arabia hasn't been successful in quelling the Houthi resistance so it's fair to say that maybe US involvement will help the Saudis do just that but thanks to the Saudi an onslaught the conflict in Yemen has morphed into the world's worst humanitarian crisis and there's been some domestic backlash here in the US and now American politicians are pushing to end US support for the Saudis but this development might lead to a Messier legal given that there was no public debate on whether the US should get involved because it seemed as if it was consciously kept from the public so I honestly wonder how Americans will feel knowing that other government could be indirectly fueling the world's worst humanitarian crisis yeah and of course that recent development as well that announcement of that big arms sell to the Saudis as well from the states as well as maybe going to prolong it we don't know well we'll keep a track of it with your help there in DC Samira thank you
