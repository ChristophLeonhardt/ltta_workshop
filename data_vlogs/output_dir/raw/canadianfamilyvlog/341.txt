31
00:01:42,950 --> 00:01:47,060
us there was me<font color="#E5E5E5"> Maddie Jessa Daniel and</font>

32
00:01:47,060 --> 00:01:49,020
one of Maddie's friends

33
00:01:49,020 --> 00:01:51,060
or maybe Jessa wasn't there there was

34
00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:53,130
two of my DS friends something like<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

35
00:01:53,130 --> 00:01:56,070
I remember but we<font color="#CCCCCC"> basically had to take</font>

36
00:01:56,070 --> 00:01:58,619
an entire railing apart and then we had

37
00:01:58,619 --> 00:02:01,530
<font color="#CCCCCC">to move after we took the brilliant part</font>

38
00:02:01,530 --> 00:02:03,450
we had to move the oven completely to a

39
00:02:03,450 --> 00:02:05,880
new room and then there's a one doorway

40
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:08,788
that's not the regulation width so we

41
00:02:08,788 --> 00:02:10,919
had to like just jam the couch through

42
00:02:10,919 --> 00:02:12,989
that doorway to get into the room that

43
00:02:12,989 --> 00:02:14,879
it's in down I thought oh well who cares

44
00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:16,019
