on Wednesday Rasmussen Reports released its daily presidential tracking poll they put President Trump at 48 percent approval that's a four point jump in two days from when asked mucin a five point increase from his recent low of 43 percent on May 16th now it is worth noting that other polls are far less favorable to Trump to contemporaneous polls the Economist and Gallup have made 40% and 38 percent respectively and Fox News has been 38 percent - but if the Trump bump is real it makes a bit of sense that's for three reasons number one Trump isn't tweeting I know a lot of Zach likes like when T tweets but because Trump is overseas and visibly traveling the globe he's not up at all hours watching MSNBC and CNN and tweeting nasty notes to the hosts or retweeting botched submarines of Fox and Friends Chiron he's also not pouring more gasoline on the Trump Russia kindling the media have set he hasn't tweeted about FBI director James Comey or reports that he told intelligence officials he'd appreciate it if they'd exonerate him or any of the other anonymous material coming out of the media daily that means that these stories tend to that quickly since anonymous stories aren't being confirmed by Trump's own hand and since Trump isn't insisting that his communications team rushed to the nearest microphones apparent his talking points most of the damage on the Trump Russia stuff has been self-inflicted and it's easy to see when Trump stops in putting said damage on himself second the country isn't collapsing Trump left the country the country's fine the less promulgates this myth whereby the president must sit at the controls of the airliner that is the United States each and every day lest we all go full zombie apocalypse on one another and the plane crashes into a building instead Trump is out of the country partying it up with glowing orbs and swords and the country is getting along pretty much just fine nobody's dying nobody's panicking in other words a predictable government is the best available option and Trump gallivanting around reminds us all he's not capable of screwing it up this badly terrorism is a winning issue for Trump this is the third point the terror attack on Monday obviously helped Trump politically because the left is so damn irresponsible about it Trump's perspective you were on vetted Muslims in the West means fewer unwanted Muslims telling each other people in killing other people in the West then that's eminently correct his skepticism of the radical Islam resonates far better than the left asinine John Lennon imagine ask pseudo philosophy Trump was elected to bomb the bleep out of Isis seeing this water of eight-year-old girls and a pop concert reminds people that's a task worth pursuing President Trump should be making notes when it comes back to the US he should be the same president Trump we're seeing abroad muted but strong of ambassador Minh when the time is right if he does all that maybe we can get this thing back on the rails I'm Ben Shapiro this is the Ben Shapiro show so we have a huge show coming up for you today coming up in just a couple of minutes we're supposed to have senator Ben Sasse from Nebraska whose book the vanishing American adult our coming-of-age crisis and how to rebuild a culture of self-reliance is is now number three on the New York Times best seller chart I'm a big fan of Senator Sasa's obviously one of the last honest conservatives in Washington DC hopefully we get the technology worked out he's supposed to call in so we'll chat with him about the issues of the day we're also going to talk about what's happening in Montana where a Republican candidate for a special election congressional seat literally body-slammed reporter and we'll talk about why it is that we continue to vote for people who bodyslam supports and why it is that that's actually somewhat understandable we'll get to all of that plus the mailbag but first I want to say thank

sass thanks so much for joining the show really appreciate your time thank you for having me on I'm grateful for the invite okay so senator stance I do want to ask you about you but first i would be remissed I didn't ask you about the news of the day I just want to get your basic take on how we should be looking at the situation in which a congressional candidate in Montana has apparently body-slammed a reporter it's been confirmed basically by Fox News report you know what should I think obviously everybody of goodwill can look at this and say this is ridiculous but how should Republicans be treating this because now they're stuck between a rock and a hard place in the middle of an election they don't want to see a Democrat when a seat how do you think Republicans ought to be treating this yeah so I've been in commitments all morning back-to-back so I know almost nothing current on it except for just that the top-line fact of what happened last night and it seems to me pretty obvious that if you are seeking a job as a public servant what are your most fundamental duties is to teach American civics and since the First Amendment is the beating heart of the American experiment and of American civics that means many many many things but one of the most basic things the First Amendment means is you don't body slam a reporter you celebrate the First Amendment well I appreciate your candor on that senator staff I think one of the big problems is obviously that if leadership in both party doesn't say the same thing that you do then what you end up with this sort of prisoner's dilemma and explain that a little bit to the listeners you don't put the sort of prisoner's dilemma where people feel okay I have to pick the the second worst choice and obviously we're electing a congressman we're not electing a pastor and that means that even if somebody does something that I find abhorrent he's going to be a better legislator than somebody else but it the leadership of both parties needs to stand together and say that when it's a problem cuz they won't do it that when people act like this that they should not be seated in my opinion I don't know you think about that yeah so I'm shooting straight with you that I've had zero conversations with anybody about where any of the leaders are on an issue like that or whether or not there's been a call for that joint press conference but let's just distinguish between short term and long term if here's what I really care about I get that in a short term basis all through life people are often presented with choices that feel like a lesser of two evils discussion that's not where I spend any of my energy I spend all of my time and energy on this which is what are we doing now to build a country where the American people will understand our shared narrative as a people and where there will be more public trust five and ten and fifteen and twenty years from now because we are not one election away from the eschaton we're not one election away from electing the guy who will drive some majority that's going to pass all their great legislation and they're going to bring about utopia America is centered in the local communities where people work and worship and where they're designing the next great app and what they're persuading people to join the Rotary Club and politics is to provide a framework for that and right now our politics is so lame and boring and stupidly short-sighted then it always feels like people think they're trying to make the lesser of two evils choice that will bring about heaven on earth it's not coming via the city I'm talking to you from DZ and this city is filled with people who are just not interesting enough to project your grant hopes and dreams on and so I think that one of the first duties of all politicians is to announce the politics in the Sun our life and Senator staffs is one of the things we love so much about you so your new book which I really want to get to the vanishing American adults are coming of age crisis and how to rebuild a culture of self-reliance it's debuting at number three on the New York Times bestseller list for nonfiction and this is actually a book folks I mean it's not just a politician wrote a memoir and now you should go buy it because politician needs to make money and put its kid through college although I assume that Senator stats would like to put his kids in college with money but I think that the book itself is actually an important look at why it is that our common culture is eroding we talk a lot on the show senators ass about the the social the social capital that used to undergird American society and that's basically what your book is about correct exactly right yeah it's a hundred vis social capital is the term we should have in screaming lights in these conversations because that's what's eroding and then all the politics are dysfunctional downstream from that poisoned river and so I I think that this book is a hundred percent not about politics it's 99 percent not about policy it's the tiny point that it touches on policy is recognizing that education needs to be radically reformed and there's going to be different kinds of job training in the future when people are disrupted out of work and jobs at 40 and 45 and 50 and 55 years old but the vast majority the book is about exactly what you flag which is social capital the American experiment recognizes that in a broken world you're going to have structure you're going to have orders you're going to have security there's going to be restraint but what we want the American founders wanted what I think the vast majority the American people actually want if you put the choice to them is they want self-control self-governance self-discipline self-restraint not power and discipline and restraint coming from another from a political center and right now this city DC is so populated by folks whose only long-term thought is about their own incumbency that they come to think that politics are the center of life anybody who thinks that the politics of the center of life is not well suited to be an American politician so senator says I want to ask you a question that I was asked last night at Northwestern speaking there about a lot of these same exact issues and it's I think the hardest question for politicians particularly and that is it's easy to a certain extent to say here's what we need to do if we're starting from scratch right you're you're 20 years old you're not married yet and now you're planning your life and I assume that your book is making the case that you need to get married you need to bring your children up in a place where there is social capital we need to make connections with each other at the local level at our churches and community level and is his hook villian sense but what we what do we do about the person who's already made a decision that takes them out of that so you have a single mom she's already made the decision that she a bad decision that she was can get pregnant out of wedlock now she has the baby and she maybe doesn't have that that support network what do we do about that you know I call on people to to provide charity but for some people they say that's not enough of an answer well what do you think we ought to be doing about that yeah it's a very fair question so you know we live east of Eden we live in a fallen world where things are broken and we're all and in my worldview were not only all sinners were also all sinned against and so everybody's always got grievances and pain and some people have pain that's much more substantial than others of us have ever experienced and so the first thing we need to do is have a shared understanding of what we can and can't accomplish in the world and what you want is a world where people are finding meaning in their local community where they have meaningful work where they have families where they have social capital or they have friendship they have intergenerational relationships where they have the time and space to wrestle through the really big and important questions which are so much bigger than politics and what we're really describing there is neighborhood what you want people to have is neighborliness you want them to have friendships you want to want them to have meaningful work and so we need to start by admitting that there is scar tissue in the world but scar tissue is often to be celebrated because scar tissue is the foundation of future character there is healing and there's there's repair there's rebuilding that happens among neighbors and friends as they work through those problems together charles Murray sometimes uses the the lime that government's job is to take the difficulty out of things but you got to be clear about what things you want the government to take the difficulty out of versus not I want the government to take the difficulty out of walking home from a restaurant late at night I don't want there to be violence and in anybody's neighborhood when they're walking home from a restaurant or walking home from work late at night but I don't want the government to take the difficulty out of cleaning up puke from my six-year-old in the middle of night because if the government tries to come into my house and solve that problem what it will actually do is create passivity in me and it turns out as I have three kids 15 13 6 I've had many many sleepless nights over the course of my life when my kids are sick in the middle of the night and my wife and I are on the edge of arguing with each other about why the other one didn't do enough to prevent this stupid thing from happening you know why would you let your kid eat that then Apple slice off the floor of the athletic arena that's the food poisoning that made him sick but you know what happened when we headed together clean up that puke in the middle of the night we have a shared experience it was the foundation of future love future healthy nostalgia future character and my kids they feel that we care for them because we do but we've demonstrated it at real moments in time and so I think that your flagging all of the brokenness of different neighborhoods and different social capital and different community government we should talk about it because there are things that government should do to mitigate some of the suffering but we first have to have a shared understanding the government can't possibly bring about youto government won't be effective at helping us clean up from a sick kid in the middle of the night so we have to understand that government is limited and bounded don't let's have a meaningful argument I'll say one more thing here I think it's important to distinguish between our commitments you're in mine too limited government and too small government because you and I believe in both of them but limited government is far more important than small government limited government is understanding that government is not utopian and that rights precede government government isn't the author the source of our rights small versus medium-sized government should be what the debate is between the Republican the Democratic Party how much intervention should there be in the economy and there could be Democrats who if they would give a full-throated defense of limited government and then make their argument for medium-sized government I might vote differently than they would but we could stand together at the kind of press conference you're talking about and reaffirm basic American values and virtues and then we could argue about the stuff we vote on but we'd recognize this stuff that we're voting on is central it's not ultimate theological philosophical dreaming senator Ben Sasse the vanishing American adult terrific book and Senator staffs one of the few honest men left in Washington DC really appreciated showing that that you know a phrase that is overused but under understood common sense still exists thanks so much senator SAS for joining ben shapiro show really appreciate your time and appreciate everything you're doing thanks we have a great day already so folks meanwhile I mentioned it to senators ask they're the big story of the day obviously is what's happening in Montana's there's a special election in Montana today the Democrat and the Republican are running pretty close together and it's now been thrown into turmoil because look like the Republican was going to win is a guy named Jian Forte Greg Ginn Florida and Greg Jian Forte last night apparently he was he was being asked a question by Ben Jacobs who's a reporter for I think Politico but in any case he oh sorry for the Guardian and Jim forte apparently grabs this reporter and bodyslams him and this guy tweets out last night that I was bodyslam my glasses were broken here is the reporter Ben Jacobs his description of being attacked last night I just wanted to take her she was standing around there just to reach out and get his response to see Oh score on that he'd been talking about that he'd been holding off his opinion on health care at least under stunt until he saw the CBO score next thing I know I'm being body slammed and he you know he's on top of me for a second my glasses are broken the strangest the strangest moment didn't my entire life recording he perhaps my recorder and iPhone it but the audio should be up right now in the Guardian and yet throws me down my glasses break II said if I think I'm pretty sure he's on company whaling for a second and I'm screams at me to get the hell out and yeah his staffer comes in it's just very strange and mortifying because you know I'm used to God you don't even know holiday didn't until a lot of people on the right immediately go well we hate the media so he must be lying or we watch in for day one him to win so this must all be false okay as someone who has a little bit of experience in these arenas where people claim that an assault or a battery is not an assault or a battery because we don't like the person who's being assaulted or batted around or we don't or we do like the person who's committing the assault and battery I have a basic standard on this I treat politicians like I treat every other human being and that is to say when they commit assault or battery that is something wrong that is something bad now the right immediate tendency which was oh it couldn't have happened the way this reporter said it happened that sort of fell apart when number one audio came out of the actual confrontation here's what it sounded like there's no video but here's audio of the actual confrontation between this fellow Jian Forte the Republican candidate in Montana and this reporter Ben Jacobs and we'll talk about that later yeah but there's not gonna become a discursive Eddie I think you Shane please put you tired you guys the last of the king who you did the same thing get the hell I choose get the hell out the lines I do the same to you in the garden yes if you just broke many muscles you last got to be the same damn thing you just body slide me at broke my glasses get the hell out of here yes I mean the audio is about as clear as it can be and then fox news comes out and confirms the accounts again very reminiscent of past situations but the Fox News reports that as part of our preparation for a story about Thursday's special election to air and special report with prepare we arranged interviews with the top two candidates I joined field producer faith Mangan and photographer Keith rally in Bozeman for our scheduled to interview with June for 10 person writing as Alicia hakuna who is a reporter for for Fox News and says at this point she unfortunate grabbed Jacobs by the neck with both hands and slams him into the ground behind him faith Keith and I watched and disbelief as June 4k then began punching the reporter as June 14 moved on top of Jacobs he began yelling something to the effect of I'm sick and tired of this Jacob scrambled to his knees and said something about his glasses being broken he has faith Keith in myself for our names in shock we did not answer Jacobson said he wanted the police called and when to leave chin for a looked at the three of us and repeatedly apologized at that point I told him in Scanlan who is now president present that we needed a moment and then the men left so a few things to be said about this I want to talk about the rights response to this I think it's more interesting than the left's response the less response is at least largely hypocritical so we'll say about that briefly first I want to say thank you to our sponsors over at my Patriot supply so if you are looking at the world right now and feeling uncertain about the way that the world is working if you feel a little bit scared about what's going on North Korea if you feel like natural disasters could happen and the government wouldn't be able to take care of you that's why you need a floor week emergency food supply for just 99 bucks again this is the stuff that you just put in your closet you forget about it until an emergency arises and then you're glad these spend the $99 and you get free shipping as well the order now eight eight eight eight oh three fourteen thirteen eight eight eight eight oh three fourteen thirteen or online and prepare with Ben comprehend calm and you get that four week emergency food supply for just $99 the food apparently tastes like home cooking for people in studio tell me it's prepared with been calm four-week emergency food supply for just 99 bucks plus free shipping and that makes sure that you are covered in case of emergency okay so the right response to this news vet reinforced has online last night when this happened and half the right says this is pretty terrible and the other half of the right goes well it can't possibly happen that way but the people who are really egregious say things like well he had it coming if you believe that a reporter can be bodyslam because you don't like reporters then let me let me say to you that you are doing American wrong you're doing you're just being an American wrong Americanism does not constitute people body-slamming reporters because you don't like the question especially when the question was can you give me the ax natural question was can you give me your opinion on the Congressional Budget Office score of the new health care plan that was actually the question and he was body from one of the people who I thought was just egregious last night was Laura Ingraham she tweeted a couple of times here was Laura Ingraham sweet she said politicians always need to keep their cool but what would most Montana men do if bodyslam for no reason by another man we live in a civilized society in a civilized society when somebody assaults you the best answer if you can do it is to withdraw and call the police because a crime has been committed the best answer is not to get into tribal warfare where you then go and clock the guy with a bottle and this routine where it's like that the reporter wasn't manly enough because the reporter didn't stand up to being assaulted is just ridiculous okay and she she continued along these lines sweet 14 she if we can grab that 14 yeah she said did anyone get his lunch money stolen today and then run to tell the recess monitor okay if I had something stolen from me I would run to tell the police wouldn't you but again there's this notion that there's this macho brash stupidity that really is like high school bullying that is emerged on the right side of the aisle it's existed for the parts of the left for a long time but it's emerged on the right side of the aisle where it's like civilization takes you back to you I'd rather have a macho guy there because strength strength power power strength macho okay you don't need your Congress people to be macho you need them to be wise you need them to exercise values you don't need them to be body slamming reporters so this sort of stuff is really gross and I will say that it has risen in the wake of Trump because Trump used to talk like this on the campaign trail that is true now the left is on this to immediately suggest that it's about Trump the June 14th admits and he's going to get away with it because of Trump I don't think that's right I think that Trump is a symptom of something deeper I think she in Forte's symptom of something deeper Kirsten powers who is a a person of the left she says that it's really Trump's fault because you need reporters all the time it just happened it's mostly possibly like tied into the fact that we have a president that's constantly fomenting rage against reporters I mean it's possible there's some connection we have a country doesn't trust reporting no no but it's at a different level than it's ever been I mean we it there's no comparison to the way it is today than even a year ago frankly the absolute rage towards reporter okay this idea that Trump's rage toward reporters that people who don't like reporters of the reason maybe it's the GM Forte's and nut is the reason this happened you can't do this what Kirsten powers is doing is number 1 Trump isn't in Montana even and number two the fact is that people on the Left use this kind of language all the time so for example last night K CNN counterterrorism analyst was very angry at Trey Gowdy's on the House Intelligence Committee and this CNN counterterrorism analysts said this about trey Gowdy he field that's what's so frustrating did collusion exist that's the burning question that everybody wants answered and then Brennan says well I know of contacts and communication well trey Gowdy ought to have a kid he knows the difference between intelligence and evidence let me tell you something Allison if you're an American citizen and the national security agency collects intelligence that is intercepts of Russians who report what you've said do you think it's fair to go to a court and say that's evidence that you did something wrong that's why the FBI is going to take a year or more to investigate this because the American citizens involved in this have a right to have evidence presented in a court beyond a conversation that a Russian official reports in my world this distinction is black and white there's a hard line I know it's frustrating for the American people but I hope they don't want evidence to be perceived as something that a Russian official says and that's it you can be convicted on that okay so he actually goes ahead and he says somebody should kick out his ass it's really ridiculous that people on the Left can say that and again they'll say that this rhetoric causes no violence it causes no violence when Barack Obama says things like bring a knife to a gunfight but cause violence when Trump says things like I'm going to defend somebody who punches somebody all of these things are wrong okay so now with that said I want to show you why it is that people are going to vote for this guy Gian Forte anyway and there's a logic to this so we're going to actually get out the Glenn Beck charts we're going to get up and going back a whiteboard and do a full on chart here we go so I know that game theory has become sort of a joke I know that people think that game theory because on Twitter somebody some guy badly laid out game theory but there's a real game theory reason as to why people are going to end up voting for Gian Forte so this is a basic prisoner's dilemma in game theory game theory is really about how to how two people play a game together how they come up with a strategy and the problem is that there's no coordination at the top level between the Republican and Democratic parties to say that bad behavior means you won't be seated bad behavior means that we're not going to side with you are going to pull support so what you actually have in the right hand centers for a long time is the left will endorse any bad behavior so long as it serves their side we can't be the only ones who are virtuous and you can see how this leads everyone into worse behavior at least two were standards for everyone so the way the game theory works is basically this is the most basic form of game theory it's the most famous form of game theory this is called the prisoner's dilemma so here you have prisoner one okay and here is prisoner number two okay and the end they are arrested for they're arrested for murder okay they both killed somebody together and now they're arrested and so they do what they do in LA Confidential they put them in separate interrogation rooms and they tell one of them here's the deal the deal is this if you confess and your partner does not confess then you get off scot-free you can blame it on your partner right you can just say my partner did it wasn't me if both of you confess you're both going to jail for five years if neither of you confesses if neither of you confesses then we can't really convict you so we'll put you in jail for like a year for some lesser crime and if you're the person who doesn't confess if you're the person who stays silent and your other guy blames you you're going to end up spending 10 years in prison so that's what it looks like on the board here so on the board basically each of these prisoners has two choices choice number one is to stay silent choice number two is to confess right choice number one stay silent number two to confess so there's a prisoner one prisoner to the penalty as I just laid it out is if somebody if both of them are silent if both of them are silent then they both go to jail for one year right if prisoner one confesses and prisoner two is silent then prisoner one goes free because he blames the other guy and prisoner two gets ten years in prison if they both confess they both get five years in prison and if again prisoner one stays silent and prisoner two confesses then prisoner two ends up with then prisoner one ends up with ten years in prison and prisoner two ends up with zero years in prison because the person who ended up confessing is the person who ends up going free basically so how does it apply how does this make sense okay so in the context of voting when people say it's a binary choice when people say the Democrats are going to cheat anyway so it doesn't matter what you do they're going to cheat the reason that both of these prisoners are going to end up confessing is because they don't trust each other if they trusted each other they would end up here right if they trusted each other they would both shut their yaps and they both spend a year in prison and then they'd go free if they don't trust each other if prisoner one thinks that prisoner two is going to confess then he has two choices right a prisoner one thinks that prisoner two is going to confess then he's either going to spend 10 years in prison or five years in prison so he is going to confess also and a prisoner 2 thinks the prisoner 1 is going to confess he has the same exact choice he can either spend 10 years in prison or I can spend 5 years in prison so if they don't trust each other they're both going to confess and so you actually end up is the prisoner's dilemma and this is what that I believe they would call the Nash equilibrium in this particular scenario this is where they would actually end up they would end up in this box if you don't trust each other you end up in that box now the Republican Party and Democratic Party don't trust each other the Democrats think the Republicans are going to always elect the worst guy no matter what and the Republicans think the Democrats are always going to elect the worst guy no matter what so they don't want to be in the position where the Democrats cheat the Democrats put Teddy Kennedy in office and they don't care about it and it's fine it's all good and then they're the ones who act virtuously they say you know we're not going to vote for our guy because it's a bad guy and then we lose and Hillary becomes president and we lose in this Democrat Montana becomes president they don't want to end up in this so instead they say well vote for the crafts guy the guy who's a piece of crap who body-slammed reporter and you end up in this box in other words the trust the distrust that we have for Americans with one another we end up both making the second worst choice right we both end up making the second worst choice which for the country as a whole is basically the worst choice because now both of you are in the worst situation the worst politician is always elected right everyone elects the worst politician because you don't want to be a guy left out on the outside now this assumes two things it assumes number one that the person who is the the criminal in this particular scenario is the best candidate and doesn't do any damage down the road I think that's a bad assumption I think that if GN Forte is elected in Montana that Democrats will use that as a club to beat Republicans with four years in the same way that they're now going to use Trump to get Republicans per year so there are costs down the road and I think that's what senator staffs was saying earlier senator sass was basically laying out that short term it looks like the best situation is this but long term you're not going to really win much more doing that and you're going to undermine your own credibility because you're a criminal so that's the that sort lay at least hear the the contention would be you maintained your silence because you were innocent right you didn't confess because you were innocent so that's the right none of these scenarios and the prisoner's dilemma actually take into account what if one of the people's innocent right what if you're innocent maybe you go to jail anyway but if you're innocent in any way you can't actually confess so that's the values argument is that we're actually outside the scope of this entire argument for values reasons we can't confess we have to remain silent regardless of what the other side does but from a pure sort of political political pragmatism point of view you're going to end up in that bottom circle so how do we cure that how do we care that in order to cure that we actually need a leadership of both parties it can't be on the voters it has to be on the leadership of both parties because we can't it's going to be too hard to get all voters all across the country to say we're not going to let people who body-slamming people that's clearly the voters there's a huge percentage of them who don't care they don't care if a politician does something bad so you really need is a common deal between the leadership of both parties I'm talking about Schumer and McConnell and Paul Ryan and Nancy Pelosi that they are not going to seat people who are convicted or accused what I would take convicted of crimes people who are convicted of crimes will not be seated in the Congress right we're just not going to seat them and if we think that the evidence is sufficient that they will be convicted then we will then we will not stand by them now the leadership of a party is going to do this because they don't want to lose the seat because then they lose their majority but that's what actually needs to happen you actually need to get to the point where instead of this we are here in order to get from here to there we actually need to have a deal between both parties you need to show your commitment and you can't pre-commit just you the other person also has to commit and you have to trust them so we have to build a shared trust then we're not going to see people who are absolute pieces of crap okay so that's the basic reason why people vote for the second worst option and that's also the reason why we do need a deal as Americans and we need to build up the social capital the Senators staff is talking about otherwise we end up in
