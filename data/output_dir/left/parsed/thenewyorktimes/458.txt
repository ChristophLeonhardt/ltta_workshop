This is Emily Dickinson's
bedroom.
And this is her desk.
I've heard that this can be a
transformative experience.
I've heard that this can be a
transformative experience.
Writers have told me that they
feel closer to Dickinson here.
Writers have told me that they
feel closer to Dickinson here.
Some say that her presence
helps them write.
What happens next might sound
weird.
A calm comes over me.
And I do something I haven't
done since elementary school.
I begin to compose a poem.
The thoughts spill out in order
and do not step over each other.
I don't stop to think.
It feels thrilling.
It feels uncanny.
I don't stop writing until an
hour passes and it's time to go.
