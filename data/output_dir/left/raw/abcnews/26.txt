00:00:03,369 --> 00:00:03,803
NEWS SPECIAL REPORT.

2
00:00:03,803 --> 00:00:05,138
THE BILL COSBY VERDICT.

3
00:00:05,138 --> 00:00:08,608
NOW REPORTING, DAVID MUIR.

4
00:00:08,608 --> 00:00:09,609
>> GOOD AFTERNOON, I'M DAVID 

5
00:00:09,609 --> 00:00:10,943
MUIR COMING ON THE AIR BECAUSE 

6
00:00:10,943 --> 00:00:12,712
THERE IS BREAKING NEWS IN BILL 

7
00:00:12,712 --> 00:00:15,748
COSBY'S SEXUAL ASSAULT RETRIAL.

8
00:00:15,748 --> 00:00:16,449
THERE HAS BEEN A VERDICT.

9
00:00:16,449 --> 00:00:19,518
HE HAS BEEN FOUND GUILTY ON ALL 

10
00:00:19,518 --> 00:00:20,086
COUNTS.

11
00:00:20,086 --> 00:00:21,053
EVERS ACCUSED OF DRUGGING AND 

12
00:00:21,053 --> 00:00:22,288
ASSAULTING A WOMAN AT HIS 

13
00:00:22,288 --> 00:00:23,556
PHILADELPHIA HOME, AGAIN, 

14
00:00:23,556 --> 00:00:24,891
GUILTY, ALL COUNTS, MOMENTS AGO 

15
00:00:24,891 --> 00:00:27,560
THAT PAM OF SEVEN MEN AND FIVE 

16
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:29,095
WOMEN AFTER DELIBERATING FOR 14 

17
00:00:29,095 --> 00:00:31,097
HOURS CAME BACK WITH THE 

18
00:00:31,097 --> 00:00:31,330
VERDICT.

19
00:00:31,330 --> 00:00:32,232
THEY COME BACK WITH THREE 

20
00:00:32,232 --> 00:00:33,499
QUESTIONS IN THE LAST 24 HOURS 

21
00:00:33,499 --> 00:00:34,801
BUT NO QUESTIONS TODAY.

22
00:00:34,801 --> 00:00:36,569
I WANT TO BRING IN OUR LEGAL 

23
00:00:36,569 --> 00:00:38,705
ANALYST SUNNY HOSTIN WATCHING 

24
00:00:38,705 --> 00:00:39,973
WITH ME.

25
00:00:39,973 --> 00:00:41,407
GUILTY ON ALL THREE COUNTS.

26
00:00:41,407 --> 00:00:43,042
A SIGNIFICANT DEVELOPMENT.

27
00:00:43,042 --> 00:00:44,244
HE FACES PRISON TIME.

28
00:00:44,244 --> 00:00:44,811
SIGNIFICANT PRISON TIME. 

29
00:00:44,811 --> 00:00:45,678
>> HE DOES.

30
00:00:45,678 --> 00:00:48,047
I THINK THE ISSUE HERE WAS 

31
00:00:48,047 --> 00:00:50,416
ALWAYS ONE OF CONSENT.

32
00:00:50,416 --> 00:00:52,151
WHETHER OR NOT ANDREA CONSTAND 

33
00:00:52,151 --> 00:00:54,554
CONSENTED TO SEXUAL 

34
00:00:54,554 --> 00:00:56,256
RELATIONSHIPS WITH BILL COSBY 

35
00:00:56,256 --> 00:00:58,024
AND I THINK, YOU KNOW, WHAT 

36
00:00:58,024 --> 00:00:59,525
IS -- WHAT WAS THE GAME CHANGER 

37
00:00:59,525 --> 00:01:02,695
HERE WAS THE OTHER WOMEN ALLOWED

38
00:01:02,695 --> 00:01:04,263
TO TESTIFY AND SO THE 

39
00:01:04,263 --> 00:01:05,831
PROSECUTION HERE THEN WAS ABLE 

40
00:01:05,831 --> 00:01:08,734
TO PROVE THIS WAS A PATTERN FOR 

41
00:01:08,734 --> 00:01:09,269
BILL COSBY.

42
00:01:09,269 --> 00:01:10,069
HE DRUGGED WOMEN.

43
00:01:10,069 --> 00:01:12,071
HE THEN ASSAULTED WOMEN WITHOUT 

44
00:01:12,071 --> 00:01:13,239
THEIR CONSENT BECAUSE CLEARLY 

45
00:01:13,239 --> 00:01:15,641
YOU CAN'T CONSENT IF YOU ARE 

46
00:01:15,641 --> 00:01:18,111
UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF DRUGS OR 

47
00:01:18,111 --> 00:01:18,344
ALCOHOL.

48
00:01:18,344 --> 00:01:19,512
AND SO THAT I THINK WAS THE 

49
00:01:19,512 --> 00:01:21,948
DIFFERENCE IN THIS CASE AS 

50
00:01:21,948 --> 00:01:23,650
OPPOSED TO THE FORMER TRIAL 

51
00:01:23,650 --> 00:01:25,118
WHERE WE KNOW THAT THE JURY 

52
00:01:25,118 --> 00:01:26,686
DEADLOCKED ON WHETHER OR NOT TO 

53
00:01:26,686 --> 00:01:27,353
CONVICT BILL COSBY. 

54
00:01:27,353 --> 00:01:30,022
>> FOR THOSE OF OUR VIEWERS 

55
00:01:30,022 --> 00:01:33,092
JOINING US NOW, BILL COSBY'S 

56
00:01:33,092 --> 00:01:34,460
RETRIAL.

57
00:01:34,460 --> 00:01:35,628
HE'S JUST BEEN FOUND GUILTY ON 

58
00:01:35,628 --> 00:01:37,430
ALL COUNTS.

59
00:01:37,430 --> 00:01:38,898
WE DO KNOW THIS CONVICTION COULD

60
00:01:38,898 --> 00:01:41,534
PUT HIM IN PRISON FOR UP TO TEN 

61
00:01:41,534 --> 00:01:43,970
YEARS ON EACH COUNT, OUR TEAM 

62
00:01:43,970 --> 00:01:44,737
INSIDE THE COURTROOM REPORTING 

63
00:01:44,737 --> 00:01:46,472
THAT THERE WAS NO REACTION FROM 

64
00:01:46,472 --> 00:01:47,273
BILL COSBY.

65
00:01:47,273 --> 00:01:48,541
HE LOOKED STRAIGHT AHEAD AS THIS

66
00:01:48,541 --> 00:01:49,642
VERDICT WAS DELIVERED.

67
00:01:49,642 --> 00:01:50,977
THOUGH THERE WERE AUDIBLE GASPS 

68
00:01:50,977 --> 00:01:53,412
IN THE COURTROOM AND ANDREA 

69
00:01:53,412 --> 00:01:54,547
CONSTAND NODDING HER HEAD WHEN 

70
00:01:54,547 --> 00:01:55,648
SHE HEARD THE VERDICT.

71
00:01:55,648 --> 00:01:56,983
AS WE KNOW THIS IS THE SECOND 

72
00:01:56,983 --> 00:01:59,252
TIME SHE HAS FACED BILL COSBY IN

73
00:01:59,252 --> 00:02:01,154
COURT AND, SUNNY, AS YOU POINTED

74
00:02:01,154 --> 00:02:02,255
OUT THE MAJOR DIFFERENCE THEY 

75
00:02:02,255 --> 00:02:03,889
WERE ABLE TO HEAR FROM OTHER 

76
00:02:03,889 --> 00:02:05,558
WOMEN THAT MIGHT HAVE BOLSTERED 

77
00:02:05,558 --> 00:02:05,858
THIS CASE. 

78
00:02:05,858 --> 00:02:07,727
>> ABSOLUTELY, ABSOLUTELY, AND I

79
00:02:07,727 --> 00:02:09,662
THINK THAT'S SOMETHING THAT BILL

80
00:02:09,662 --> 00:02:10,496
COSBY'S ATTORNEYS CERTAINLY 

81
00:02:10,496 --> 00:02:12,198
FOUGHT AGAINST.

82
00:02:12,198 --> 00:02:15,068
HIS PRIOR ATTORNEYS, MORE 

83
00:02:15,068 --> 00:02:15,368
SUCCESSFUL.

84
00:02:15,368 --> 00:02:16,736
AND I WILL SAY WHEN YOU'RE A 

85
00:02:16,736 --> 00:02:19,539
PROSECUTOR AS I WAS AND YOU WANT

86
00:02:19,539 --> 00:02:22,575
TO PROVE THAT THIS IS -- THIS IS

87
00:02:22,575 --> 00:02:25,111
THE BEHAVIOR OF SOMEONE, IT 

88
00:02:25,111 --> 00:02:26,479
CERTAINLY IS MUCH MORE POWERFUL 

89
00:02:26,479 --> 00:02:28,514
IF YOU HAVE MORE THAN ONE VOICE.

90
00:02:28,514 --> 00:02:30,383
WE'RE IN THE TIME OF THE ME TOO 

91
00:02:30,383 --> 00:02:32,184
MOVEMENT AND I'M SURE CERTAINLY 

92
00:02:32,184 --> 00:02:33,486
THERE IS A HEIGHTENED AWARENESS 

93
00:02:33,486 --> 00:02:35,254
OF SEXUAL ASSAULT AND THE 

94
00:02:35,254 --> 00:02:37,190
QUESTION OF CONSENT SO IF YOU'RE

95
00:02:37,190 --> 00:02:39,626
A PROSECUTOR YOU NOT ONLY HAVE 

96
00:02:39,626 --> 00:02:44,063
ANDREA'S VOICE, YNOW YOU HAVE 

97
00:02:44,063 --> 00:02:44,831
ONE, TWO -- I BELIEVE THERE WERE

98
00:02:44,831 --> 00:02:45,764
FIVE WOMEN THAT TESTIFIED THIS 

99
00:02:45,764 --> 00:02:47,333
WAS HIS PATTERN AND PRACTICE.

100
00:02:47,333 --> 00:02:49,168
IT IS VERY DIFFICULT IN MY VIEW 

101
00:02:49,168 --> 00:02:51,570
FOR A JURY TO LOOK AWAY UNDER 

102
00:02:51,570 --> 00:02:52,639
THOSE CIRCUMSTANCES.

103
00:02:52,639 --> 00:02:54,474
THAT WOULD BE OVERWHELMING 

104
00:02:54,474 --> 00:02:56,442
EVIDENCE OF A PATTERN OF 

105
00:02:56,442 --> 00:02:57,609
PRACTICE OF SEXUAL ASSAULT. 

106
00:02:57,609 --> 00:02:58,811
>> YOU BRING UP THE MOMENT THE 

107
00:02:58,811 --> 00:03:00,246
COUNTRY IS IN, THE ME TOO 

108
00:03:00,246 --> 00:03:01,547
MOVEMENT BRINGING MUCH NEEDED 

109
00:03:01,547 --> 00:03:03,016
ATTENTION TO WOMEN IN THE 

110
00:03:03,016 --> 00:03:04,617
WORKPLACE AND WOMEN WHO HAVE 

111
00:03:04,617 --> 00:03:07,420
ACCUSED PEOPLE OF HIGH PROFILE 

112
00:03:07,420 --> 00:03:08,988
BEFORE, THAT WOULD INCLUDE BILL 

113
00:03:08,988 --> 00:03:10,456
COSBY, IT WAS INTERESTING, HIS 

114
00:03:10,456 --> 00:03:12,625
OWN DEFENSE TEAM POINTED TO THE 

115
00:03:12,625 --> 00:03:14,393
ME TOO MOVEMENT HOPING TO MAKE 

116
00:03:14,393 --> 00:03:16,963
THE CASE THIS WOULD BE A MOB 

117
00:03:16,963 --> 00:03:18,264
MENTALITY IN THE EFFORT TO RETRY

118
00:03:18,264 --> 00:03:18,765
HIM.

119
00:03:18,765 --> 00:03:19,865
WE DO KNOW FROM THE COURTROOM 

120
00:03:19,865 --> 00:03:23,069
THREE ACCUSERS BURST INTO TEARS 

121
00:03:23,069 --> 00:03:24,604
AFTER THEY HEARD THE VERDICT.

122
00:03:24,604 --> 00:03:26,839
WE'RE NOW GETTING REPORTS THAT 

123
00:03:26,839 --> 00:03:28,040
BILL COSBY WHO SAT THERE 

124
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:29,075
LISTENED TO THE VERDICT LOOKING 

125
00:03:29,075 --> 00:03:30,910
STRAIGHT AHEAD HAS NOW PUT HIS 

126
00:03:30,910 --> 00:03:33,179
HEAD DOWN, HIS EYES CLOSED 

127
00:03:33,179 --> 00:03:34,514
TAKING DEEP BREATHS.

128
00:03:34,514 --> 00:03:36,883
WE MENTIONED THAT ANDREA 

129
00:03:36,883 --> 00:03:37,950
CONSTAND NODDED HER HEAD IN 

130
00:03:37,950 --> 00:03:39,385
APPROVAL WHEN SHE HEARD THE 

131
00:03:39,385 --> 00:03:41,187
VERDICT THAT SHE CERTAINLY WAS 

132
00:03:41,187 --> 00:03:42,088
HOPING FOR.

133
00:03:42,088 --> 00:03:44,023
AGAIN, AS YOU'RE WATCHING RIGHT 

134
00:03:44,023 --> 00:03:45,491
NOW, BILL COSBY FOUND GUILTY ON 

135
00:03:45,491 --> 00:03:46,793
ALL THREE COUNTS IN THIS 

136
00:03:46,793 --> 00:03:47,126
RETRIAL.

137
00:03:47,126 --> 00:03:48,894
HE FACES UP TO TEN YEARS FOR 

138
00:03:48,894 --> 00:03:51,030
EACH OF THOSE COUNTS AND QUICKLY

139
00:03:51,030 --> 00:03:53,299
BEFORE WE SAY GOOD-BYE ON THIS, 

140
00:03:53,299 --> 00:03:55,501
SUNNY, HE FACES TEN YEARS IN 

141
00:03:55,501 --> 00:03:57,002
PRISON FOR EACH COUNT, WHAT ARE 

142
00:03:57,002 --> 00:03:57,870
WE LIKELY TO SEE. 

143
00:03:57,870 --> 00:04:00,173
>> YOU KNOW, HE IS AN 

144
00:04:00,173 --> 00:04:01,274
80-YEAR-OLD MAN AND ANY SENTENCE

145
00:04:01,274 --> 00:04:02,775
AT THIS POINT OF TEN YEARS IS A 

146
00:04:02,775 --> 00:04:04,610
DEATH SENTENCE IN MY VIEW.

147
00:04:04,610 --> 00:04:07,980
THE JUDGE WILL LOOK AT THE CASE,

148
00:04:07,980 --> 00:04:09,448
THE JUDGE WILL LOOK AT HIS 

149
00:04:09,448 --> 00:04:10,450
STATURE IN THE COMMUNITY.

150
00:04:10,450 --> 00:04:12,118
THE JUDGE WILL LISTEN TO VICTIM 

151
00:04:12,118 --> 00:04:13,219
IMPACT STATEMENTS.

152
00:04:13,219 --> 00:04:14,487
IT'S VERY POSSIBLE THAT THE 

153
00:04:14,487 --> 00:04:16,889
JUDGE -- THE JUDGE HAS WIDE 

154
00:04:16,889 --> 00:04:18,257
DISCRETION HERE SO WE'RE LOOKING

155
00:04:18,257 --> 00:04:20,392
AT ANY AMOUNT OF TIME, IT COULD 

156
00:04:20,392 --> 00:04:22,195
BE NO TIME IN PRISON OR IT COULD

157
00:04:22,195 --> 00:04:24,263
BE UP TO 30 YEARS IF THE JUDGE 

158
00:04:24,263 --> 00:04:26,999
DECIDES THIS IS SOMETHING THAT 

159
00:04:26,999 --> 00:04:28,735
NEEDS TO SEND A MESSAGE TO WOMEN

160
00:04:28,735 --> 00:04:30,069
IN OUR COMMUNITY THAT ENOUGH IS 

161
00:04:30,069 --> 00:04:30,302
ENOUGH.

162
00:04:30,302 --> 00:04:33,339
THAT YOU CAN'T DO THIS AND GET 

163
00:04:33,339 --> 00:04:33,806
AWAY WIT.

164
00:04:33,806 --> 00:04:35,675
HE COULD VERY WELL SPEND THE 

165
00:04:35,675 --> 00:04:36,709
REST OF HIS LIFE IN PRISON. 

166
00:04:36,709 --> 00:04:38,944
>> HOW LIKELY IS IT HE WOULDN'T 

167
00:04:38,944 --> 00:04:40,413
FACE ANY PRISON TIME?

168
00:04:40,413 --> 00:04:41,880
>> I HAVE TO SAY I THINK THAT'S 

169
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:44,717
VERY UNLIKELY, AGAIN, GIVEN THE 

170
00:04:44,717 --> 00:04:46,119
SEVERITY OF THE CONVICTIONS 

171
00:04:46,119 --> 00:04:48,154
HERE, OF THE VERDICT.

172
00:04:48,154 --> 00:04:50,289
AND OF HIS ACTIONS AND THE 

173
00:04:50,289 --> 00:04:53,092
MOMENT THAT WE'RE IN IN TERMS OF

174
00:04:53,092 --> 00:04:54,627
ACCOUNTABILITY FOR MEN AND 

175
00:04:54,627 --> 00:04:55,495
AGGRESSION TOWARDS WOMEN.

176
00:04:55,495 --> 00:04:57,096
I WOULD BE VERY SURPRISED IF HE 

177
00:04:57,096 --> 00:04:58,264
DID NOT SERVE ANY TIME IN PRESS 

178
00:04:58,264 --> 00:05:02,802
SFLN WE DID SEE BILL COSBY'S 

179
00:05:02,802 --> 00:05:04,536
WIFE LATE IN THE RETRIAL AP

180
00:05:04,536 --> 00:05:05,137
APPEARING AT THE COURTHOUSE.

181
00:05:05,137 --> 00:05:06,372
>> SHE CERTAINLY HAS STOOD BY 

182
00:05:06,372 --> 00:05:06,905
HER HUSBAND.

183
00:05:06,905 --> 00:05:10,576
SHE HAS BEEN VERY SUPPORTIVE OF 

184
00:05:10,576 --> 00:05:10,742
HIM.

185
00:05:10,742 --> 00:05:13,279
I DOUBT -- I DOUBT AT THIS POINT

186
00:05:13,279 --> 00:05:15,281
THAT BILL COSBY WILL WALK AWAY 

187
00:05:15,281 --> 00:05:16,716
EVEN TODAY A FREE MAN.

188
00:05:16,716 --> 00:05:18,117
MY GUESS IS THAT THE PROSECUTION

189
00:05:18,117 --> 00:05:20,386
WILL ASK FOR HIS BAIL TO BE 

190
00:05:20,386 --> 00:05:20,620
REVOKED.

191
00:05:20,620 --> 00:05:21,287
>> ALMOST IMMEDIATELY.

192
00:05:21,287 --> 00:05:22,722
>> ALMOST IMMEDIATELY AND I 

193
00:05:22,722 --> 00:05:24,390
THINK HE'LL SPEND TONIGHT IN 

194
00:05:24,390 --> 00:05:24,623
PRISON. 

195
00:05:24,623 --> 00:05:25,558
>> ALL RIGHT, SUNNY, STICK WITH 

196
00:05:25,558 --> 00:05:26,159
US HERE.

197
00:05:26,159 --> 00:05:30,163
WE DO WANT TO GET TO ABC'S 

198
00:05:30,163 --> 00:05:30,830
LINSEY DAVIS COVERING IT FROM 

199
00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:32,498
THE START AND JOINS US FROM 

200
00:05:32,498 --> 00:05:33,099
OUTSIDE THE COURTHOUSE.

201
00:05:33,099 --> 00:05:35,101
I KNOW YOU WERE INSIDE THE 

202
00:05:35,101 --> 00:05:35,368
COURTROOM.

203
00:05:35,368 --> 00:05:37,970
INITIAL DESCRIPTIONS OF HIM 

204
00:05:37,970 --> 00:05:39,505
LOOKING STRAIGHT AHEAD THEN 

205
00:05:39,505 --> 00:05:41,107
PUTTING HIS HEAD DOWN TAKING 

206
00:05:41,107 --> 00:05:41,741
DEEP BREATHS AS IT WAS DESCRIBED

207
00:05:41,741 --> 00:05:44,076
TO US.

208
00:05:44,076 --> 00:05:45,845
>> Reporter: DAVID, I AT A 

209
00:05:45,845 --> 00:05:46,979
CERTAIN POINT COULDN'T EVEN FIND

210
00:05:46,979 --> 00:05:47,913
WHERE HE WAS IN THE COURTROOM 

211
00:05:47,913 --> 00:05:50,115
AND I HAD BEEN LOOKING RIGHT AT 

212
00:05:50,115 --> 00:05:51,551
HIS FACE.

213
00:05:51,551 --> 00:05:52,752
WHEN THE FIRST GUILTY CAME 

214
00:05:52,752 --> 00:05:54,253
THROUGH HE JUST KIND OF DROPPED 

215
00:05:54,253 --> 00:05:56,255
HIS HEAD AND THEN HE MUST HAVE 

216
00:05:56,255 --> 00:05:58,591
DROPPED HIMSELF SO LOW THAT YOU 

217
00:05:58,591 --> 00:06:00,159
COULDN'T EVEN SEE IT ABOVE THE 

218
00:06:00,159 --> 00:06:02,328
DESK THAT WHERE HE WAS SITTING.

219
00:06:02,328 --> 00:06:04,597
HE JUST DISAPPEARED.

220
00:06:04,597 --> 00:06:05,732
SO I COULDN'T GIVE YOU ANY KIND 

221
00:06:05,732 --> 00:06:07,132
OF REACTION OTHER THAN WHAT 

222
00:06:07,132 --> 00:06:08,434
MIGHT BE DESCRIBED AS SOMEONE 

223
00:06:08,434 --> 00:06:10,803
WHO IS SITTING AND KIND OF 

224
00:06:10,803 --> 00:06:12,238
PARTLY COLLAPSES FORWARD.

225
00:06:12,238 --> 00:06:16,742
IN THE ROOM, THERE WAS 

226
00:06:16,742 --> 00:06:17,710
AUDIBLE -- THERE WERE AUDIBLE 

227
00:06:17,710 --> 00:06:17,977
GASPS.

228
00:06:17,977 --> 00:06:19,178
THERE WERE FOUR SURVIVORS OR 

229
00:06:19,178 --> 00:06:20,779
THEY CALL THEMSELVES THE 

230
00:06:20,779 --> 00:06:23,149
SURVIVOR SISTERS, FOUR COSBY 

231
00:06:23,149 --> 00:06:24,283
ACCUSERS, THREE OF WHOM HAVE 

232
00:06:24,283 --> 00:06:25,351
BEEN HERE EVERY SINGLE DAY FOR 

233
00:06:25,351 --> 00:06:27,653
THE TRIAL THAT LASTED FOR 12 

234
00:06:27,653 --> 00:06:29,355
DAYS PLUS THESE TWO DAYS OF 

235
00:06:29,355 --> 00:06:30,656
DELIBERATIONS AND THEN LAST 

236
00:06:30,656 --> 00:06:32,191
YEAR, IN JUNE, THEY WERE HERE AS

237
00:06:32,191 --> 00:06:32,391
WELL.

238
00:06:32,391 --> 00:06:34,627
DAY IN AND DAY OUT FOR THAT 

239
00:06:34,627 --> 00:06:34,827
TRIAL.

240
00:06:34,827 --> 00:06:36,695
THEY HAD TO BE ESCORTED OUT OF 

241
00:06:36,695 --> 00:06:38,598
THE COURTROOM BECAUSE THEY 

242
00:06:38,598 --> 00:06:40,499
SOBBED SO LOUDLY AND THEY ASKED 

243
00:06:40,499 --> 00:06:41,767
TO BE ABLE TO STAY.

244
00:06:41,767 --> 00:06:43,469
THEY SAID THEY WERE GOING TO 

245
00:06:43,469 --> 00:06:44,537
STOP CRYING BUT THEY HAD TO 

246
00:06:44,537 --> 00:06:45,037
LEAVE.

247
00:06:45,037 --> 00:06:45,905
THEY WERE OVERCOME.

248
00:06:45,905 --> 00:06:47,540
THREE OF THEM THAT WERE ESCORTED

249
00:06:47,540 --> 00:06:49,442
OUT, ONE WAS ABLE TO STAY BUT 

250
00:06:49,442 --> 00:06:51,677
JUST OVERCOME WITH SO MUCH 

251
00:06:51,677 --> 00:06:53,045
EMOTION THAT MANY OF THEM, MANY 

252
00:06:53,045 --> 00:06:55,814
OF THESE ACCUSERS GOING BACK TO 

253
00:06:55,814 --> 00:06:58,918
THE 1980s SAYING AND IN SOME 

254
00:06:58,918 --> 00:07:00,786
CASES BEYOND THAT BUT SAYING 

255
00:07:00,786 --> 00:07:02,087
THEY HAD BEEN DRUGGED AND 

256
00:07:02,087 --> 00:07:04,757
SEXUALLY ASSAULTED BY BILL 

257
00:07:04,757 --> 00:07:05,124
COSBY.

258
00:07:05,124 --> 00:07:07,093
>> LINSEY, AS YOU KNOW, WE HAD 

259
00:07:07,093 --> 00:07:08,261
EVERY EXPECTATION THAT 

260
00:07:08,261 --> 00:07:10,096
PROSECUTORS WOULD ASK ALMOST 

261
00:07:10,096 --> 00:07:11,397
IMMEDIATELY THAT BAIL BE 

262
00:07:11,397 --> 00:07:11,831
REVOKED.

263
00:07:11,831 --> 00:07:14,867
ANY WORD ON THAT?

264
00:07:14,867 --> 00:07:16,802
>> WE'VE HEARD THAT THEY WILL 

265
00:07:16,802 --> 00:07:18,638
ASK BUT IT'S NOT CLEAR AND IT'S 

266
00:07:18,638 --> 00:07:20,873
UP TO THE JUDGE TO DECIDE, OF 

267
00:07:20,873 --> 00:07:22,274
COURSE, HE'S GOING TO TAKE INTO 

268
00:07:22,274 --> 00:07:23,208
CONSIDERATION HERE'S A MAN THAT 

269
00:07:23,208 --> 00:07:25,377
IN TWO MONTHS HE'S GOING TO BE 

270
00:07:25,377 --> 00:07:27,146
81 YEARS OLD.

271
00:07:27,146 --> 00:07:28,314
HE'S LEGALLY BLIND AND SO HOW 

272
00:07:28,314 --> 00:07:30,950
MUCH OF A THREAT TO SOCIETY IS 

273
00:07:30,950 --> 00:07:31,116
HE?

274
00:07:31,116 --> 00:07:32,117
CERTAINLY THESE ARE ARGUMENTS 

275
00:07:32,117 --> 00:07:34,553
THAT WILL BE MADE BY TOM 

276
00:07:34,553 --> 00:07:35,888
MESEREAU HIS LEAD DEFENSE 

277
00:07:35,888 --> 00:07:37,423
ATTORNEY SO IT WILL BE UP TO THE

278
00:07:37,423 --> 00:07:38,090
JUDGE.

279
00:07:38,090 --> 00:07:39,592
WE'RE TOLD THAT SENTENCING WOULD

280
00:07:39,592 --> 00:07:41,427
TAKE PLACE IN 60 TO 90 DAYS FROM

281
00:07:41,427 --> 00:07:41,627
NOW. 

282
00:07:41,627 --> 00:07:43,863
>> AS YOU MENTIONED HIS DEFENSE 

283
00:07:43,863 --> 00:07:44,931
TEAM, THEY HAD MADE THE ARGUMENT

284
00:07:44,931 --> 00:07:46,799
I MENTIONED WITH SUNNY A MOMENT 

285
00:07:46,799 --> 00:07:48,801
AGO THIS ME TOO MOVEMENT THAT 

286
00:07:48,801 --> 00:07:50,202
BILL COSBY IN THE RETRIAL HAD 

287
00:07:50,202 --> 00:08:26,973
BEEN SWEPT UP IN THAT QUESTIONS 

288
00:08:26,973 --> 00:08:28,674
YEAR'S JURY WAS ASKING AS FAR AS

289
00:08:28,674 --> 00:08:29,908
WHAT'S THE LEGAL DEFINITION OF 

290
00:08:29,908 --> 00:08:30,142
CONSENT.

291
00:08:30,142 --> 00:08:31,711
WE JUST HAD NO IDEA.

292
00:08:31,711 --> 00:08:33,712
BUT, WHAT I WILL SAY, THE 

293
00:08:33,712 --> 00:08:36,148
LARGE -- TWO LARGE FACTORS HERE,

294
00:08:36,148 --> 00:08:37,515
DIFFERENCE BETWEEN LAST TRIAL 

295
00:08:37,515 --> 00:08:39,150
AND THIS TRIAL, OF COURSE, AS 

296
00:08:39,150 --> 00:08:40,452
YOU MENTIONED WE'RE NOW IN THE 

297
00:08:40,452 --> 00:08:42,554
ME TOO MOVEMENT ERA BUT ALSO 

298
00:08:42,554 --> 00:08:45,424
THAT YOU HEARD FROM THOSE FIVE 

299
00:08:45,424 --> 00:08:46,826
ADDITIONAL ACCUSERS THIS GO 

300
00:08:46,826 --> 00:08:47,193
ROUND.

301
00:08:47,193 --> 00:08:49,495
WHETHER OR NOT YOU BELIEVED 

302
00:08:49,495 --> 00:08:50,696
ANDREA CONSTAND YOU HAD THOSE 

303
00:08:50,696 --> 00:08:52,365
FIVE OTHER WOMEN SAYING, YES, IT

304
00:08:52,365 --> 00:08:53,866
HAPPENED TO ME TOO.

305
00:08:53,866 --> 00:08:57,569
WITH VERY SIMILAR DESCRIPTIONS 

306
00:08:57,569 --> 00:08:58,904
IN MANY CASES USED THE SAME 

307
00:08:58,904 --> 00:09:00,105
WORDS TO DESCRIBE HOW THEY FELT 

308
00:09:00,105 --> 00:09:01,907
AFTER THEY SAY THEY HAD BEEN 

309
00:09:01,907 --> 00:09:03,643
DRUGGED AND HOW THEY SAY THAT 

310
00:09:03,643 --> 00:09:05,244
THEY HAD BEEN SEXUALLY 

311
00:09:05,244 --> 00:09:06,112
ASSAULTED.

312
00:09:06,112 --> 00:09:07,846
SO WHILE THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY 

313
00:09:07,846 --> 00:09:11,083
BACK IN 2005 HAD SAID INITIALLY 

314
00:09:11,083 --> 00:09:13,485
HE HADN'T CHARGED BILL COSBY 

315
00:09:13,485 --> 00:09:15,054
BECAUSE HE SAID THAT ANDREA 

316
00:09:15,054 --> 00:09:16,589
CONSTAND HAD RUINED HER OWN 

317
00:09:16,589 --> 00:09:17,690
CREDIBILITY AND WOULD NOT BE 

318
00:09:17,690 --> 00:09:19,158
BELIEVED BY A JURY, HERE YOU 

319
00:09:19,158 --> 00:09:20,693
HAVE -- HE'S PROVEN WRONG TODAY 

320
00:09:20,693 --> 00:09:22,895
AND GUILTY ON ALL THREE COUNTS.

321
00:09:22,895 --> 00:09:24,864
>> LINSEY, WITH JUST A FEW 

322
00:09:24,864 --> 00:09:26,265
MOMENTS LAST WAS CAMILLE COSBY 

323
00:09:26,265 --> 00:09:28,334
IN THE COURTROOM, HIS WIFE?

324
00:09:28,334 --> 00:09:31,804
>> CAMILLE COSBY WAS NOT IN THE 

325
00:09:31,804 --> 00:09:32,071
COURTROOM.

326
00:09:32,071 --> 00:09:34,340
SHE ONLY APPEARED ON THE DAY OF 

327
00:09:34,340 --> 00:09:36,441
THE DEFENSE'S CLOSING ARGUMENT. 

328
00:09:36,441 --> 00:09:37,776
>> LINSEY DAVIS COVERING THIS 

329
00:09:37,776 --> 00:09:39,045
CASE AND THE PREVIOUS TRIAL, OUR

330
00:09:39,045 --> 00:09:41,080
THANKS TO YOU AND SUNNY HOSTIN 

331
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:42,648
HERE WATCHING THIS WITH ME.

332
00:09:42,648 --> 00:09:44,816
AGAIN, BILL COSBY FOUND GUILTY 

333
00:09:44,816 --> 00:09:46,018
ON ALL COUNTS IN THE RETRIAL 

334
00:09:46,018 --> 00:09:46,619
MOMENTS AGO.

335
00:09:46,619 --> 00:09:47,453
HE DOES FACE THE REAL 

336
00:09:47,453 --> 00:09:48,688
POSSIBILITY OF LIVING OUT THE 

337
00:09:48,688 --> 00:09:50,322
REST OF HIS LIFE IN PRISON AND 

338
00:09:50,322 --> 00:09:52,191
WE STILL AWAIT WORD ON WHETHER 

339
00:09:52,191 --> 00:09:53,759
OR NOT PROSECUTORS WILL ASK TO 

340
00:09:53,759 --> 00:09:54,793
REVOKE BAIL THOUGH THAT IS 

341
00:09:54,793 --> 00:09:56,195
EXPECTED AND VERY SOON.

342
00:09:56,195 --> 00:09:57,830
WE'LL HAVE MUCH MORE COMING UP 

343
00:09:57,830 --> 00:10:00,766
LATER ON ON ABC'S "WORLD NEWS 

344
00:10:00,766 --> 00:10:01,033
TONIGHT."

345
00:10:01,033 --> 00:10:03,369
UNTIL THEN I'M DAVID MUIR IN NEW

346
00:10:03,369 --> 00:10:03,569
YORK.

347
00:10:03,569 --> 00:10:03,836
GOOD DAY.
