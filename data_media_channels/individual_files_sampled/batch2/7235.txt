after Donald Trump released a series of tweets indicating that transgender individuals would not be allowed to join the military in any capacity surprisingly a number of Republican lawmakers spoke out against him let me give you a few examples first senators speak out against Donald Trump was Senator John McCain let's go to graphic six any American who meets current medical and readiness standards should be allowed to continue serving there's no reason to force servicemembers who are able to fight train and deploy to leave the military regardless of their gender identity Orrin Hatch also released a statement in regard to Trump's new policy and he did criticize it he says I don't think we should be discriminating against anyone transgender people are people and deserve the best we can do for them I look forward to getting much more information and clarity from our military leaders about the policy the president tweeted today now let me be clear about something Donald Trump tweeted what he did without even advising or communicating with the Pentagon when the Pentagon was asked you know what does this mean how are you gonna move forward how are you guys gonna move forward officials essentially said you need to ask the White House however they later release a statement saying we will continue to work closely with the White House to address the new guidance provided by the commander in chief on transgender individuals serving in the military without what that means is the new guidance provided by the commander-in-chief in a tweet this morning that we did not hear about at all that's why we don't have a plan in place see this orange buffoon doesn't know how the government works at all he doesn't know what it means to be commander-in-chief so he's like I don't know why don't I just change the policy with a tweet and then the Pentagon is like Oh for Christ's sake now we have to try to figure out what in the hell he meant by that tweet then we got to go figure it out and then implement policy no you knucklehead normal intelligent human beings who held this post before whether they're right-wingers or left wingers actually do things through a process and so God this morning you know I was so upset about Russia and my investigations they're gonna find me so I tweeted to get people distracted on this issue and to get Milo's some base who hates people to go and rush over to hate trans people and then and hence come to my defense well funny enough even or the Republican senators it didn't work and so now look they all haven't weighed in on this yet but look in the past these senators have not been in favor of LGBT rights they are now I'm a little conflicted on it because on the one hand there are now wealthy LGBT members of the of the nation who are also donating to a Republican Party so Peter Thiel gave a lot of money to Republicans and he happens to be gay libertarian so all of a sudden the position I a right softening a little bit on the other hand I'll take it great you're doing the right thing you can you can buy a politician to do and say anything but I told you guys how many years have I been telling you that we're gonna win on gay rights you know why cuz that's the one issue where we have more donors than they do so we've got Orrin Hatch and Richard Shelby from Alabama to turn and say oh I can't believe they're doing this to the trans community well Richard Shelby okay so III like that you brought Richard Shelby up because he did go on a cable news network to talk about this and it perfectly shows you illustrates how half-hearted he is in his support for the transgender community take a look at this video video one is this a move that you support from a president who vowed to support the LGBT community more than Hillary Clinton during the campaign well that would be a reversal of the current policy of the current policy is a big tent for people who want to serve you got to remember our military forces is a volunteer force I'll have to see what he's actually said read read his tweet and go from there are you can are you concerned about the four thousand transgender people currently serving or up to six thousand based on what Rand says serving in the military right now what happens to them well I think you ought to treat everybody fairly and you ought to give everybody a chance to serve how did you not read the tweets before going on CNN to talk about the topic no no he doesn't want to piss up his base he also those want to piss off his donors that's why you get that answer but that is a way better answer than what richard shelby would have given in the past saying everybody ought to be allowed to serve from a deeply conservative senator from Alabama look we won on the issue so this is a temporary blip so you know look don't get disheartened today it is it's it is distracting us as it was intended to do it is hateful which is Trump and Steve Bannon 101 and I don't want to just put it on ban and take away a response away from Trump Trump's the one who made a decision okay but at the same time they're swimming against the tide of history and they're gonna get washed out by history there's no way they're gonna win on this issue if we got Richard Shelby gone well I'm and I think everybody should serve we already won man so you okay so it's terrible that for another couple of years this discriminatory policy will be in place but I guarantee you that this is gonna get overturned certainly by the next Democratic president the next president will be a Democrat okay do this kind of hateful policies yeah I know you're super base your base of bases loves hatred and fear and discrimination they are not the majority of this country so you people voted for Trump out of incredible frustration directed towards the establishment it doesn't mean that they're in the core base who hates all people and and and don't don't want them to have equal rights if you've lost Shelby you're never gonna win and they lost the house to that house just a couple of days ago voted on this they're deeply insanely right-wing conservative Republican house that just voted to take away 23 million people's health insurance was like man the one against the transcommunity military that's a that's a bridge too far yeah well you know what else right now the military is having a very difficult time recruiting people their numbers are starting to go down people are very very like skeptical about joining let me read you a quick quote from Philip Carter he's from the center for a new security center for a New American Security he says our all-volunteer force is facing a long-term decline both in the number of young Americans qualified to serve and the propensity of those qualified Americans to serve so all right cool you want to ban you know entire groups of people from joining the military and serving the country have at it do you boo we'll see how that plays out for you yeah and finally there don't get me wrong the majority of Republicans in the House are still hateful they only got 24 Republican members of Congress to flip on that vote and vote with the Democrats that allowed trans members trans folks to serve in the military and they lost 214 to 209 in the House vote a couple of days ago all the rest of the Republicans were like no we don't believe in equal rights we don't believe in the Constitution we believe instead in we are interpretation of Yahweh that gay people are not equal to straight people so we're gonna discriminate against them that was still the overwhelming majority of the Republican Party in the house but luckily enough people switched over to the other side for them to lose that vote so even his own party it is not on Donald Trump's side completely at least so good luck to you guys run on this hateful strategy you're gonna get slaughtered in 2020 help us build independent media together TYT Network comm slash
