STEVE: PRAYER RALLY IN
OREGON WAS CUT SHORT AFTER
VIOLENCE STEVE PROTESTERS.
NEXZ GUEST SAYS THIS IS THE
LATEST EXAMPLE OF VIOLENCE
WHICH LOOKS EERILY SIMILAR
PROTESTERS BATTLED THE
POLICE IN THE STREETS.
REMEMBER THAT?
I DO.
AND IN A NEW OP-ED, CHARLIE
HURT ARGUES IF THE LEFT
KEEPS IT UP ONLY WORK
AGAINST THEM COME NOVEMBER
HERE TO EXPLAIN IS CHARLIE
HURT.
>> HOW WILL THAT WORK
AGAINST THEM?
>> SIMILARITIES THERE ARE
BETWEEN 1968 AND TODAY.
DON'T HAVE NECESSARILY A
POSITIVE MESSAGE OR AT LEAST
A POSITIVE MESSAGE THEY ARE
RUNNING ON.
INSTEAD WHAT YOU SEE FOOTAGE
LIKE SHOWING RIGHT STEVE
THUGS PRAYER GROUP IN
OREGON.
IMAGES ARE TERRIBLE.
WE SAW IT AGAIN --
YESTERDAY.
WITH THE PROTESTER WHO
CLIMBED ONTO THE STATUE OF
LIBERTY IN THE MIDDLE OF A
FOURTH OF JULY CELEBRATION.
RUINING ALL OF THESE PEOPLE
CELEBRATE THE FOURTH OF
JULY, OF COURSE.
>> BECAUSE, PEOPLE ARE --
AMERICANS ARE NOT IN TO
RADICALISM.
THEY DON'T LIKE RADICALS.
AND WHEN YOU TURN ON THE TV
AND YOU SEE WHETHER IT'S
VIOLENCE OR JUST OBNOXIOUS,
RUDE BEHAVIOR, LIKE WE SAW
YESTERDAY, IT REALLY TURNS
PEOPLE OFF AND IT MAKES
PEOPLE AND IT'S NOT JUST
INDEPENDENT VOTERS WHO SAY I
MAY NOT LOVE EVERYTHING
DONALD TRUMP DOES.
I MAY NOT LOVE THE WAY HE
SAYS THINGS.
I MAY NOT LIKE THE FACT IS
HE ON TWITTER BUT HE IS NOT
DOING.
ABOLISH ICE.
MY GOODNESS IMMIGRATION
THING IS A COMPLICATED
SITUATION.
STEVE: IT IS.
THEY UNDERSTAND THAT YOU
HAVE A PERSON HERE WHO IS
TRYING TO SOLVE THE
SITUATION TO END THE PROBLEM
AT THE BORDER.
AND THEN HAVE YOU THESE
OTHER PEOPLE WHO ARE JUST
CLIMBING ON STATUE OF
LIBERTY.
STEVE: YEAH.
GO BACK A COUPLE OF YEARS
AGO.
THE OCCUPY WALL STREET FIRST
ONE SPREAD ALL ACROSS THE
COUNTRY.
YOU KNOW, YOU ARE WILL
POLITICAL EXPERT.
IT DID SEEM TO MOTIVATE
PEOPLE ON THE OTHER SIDE.
>> WHAT WE SAW IN RESPONSE
TO THAT IS REPUBLICANS
SLOWLY TAKING OVER, YOU
KNOW, THE HOUSE, THE SENATE,
AND ULTIMATELY THE WHITE
HOUSE.
AFTER THOSE PROTESTS.
IT IS NOT VERY SMART
POLITICS.
AND ANOTHER -- INTERESTING
SIMILARITY WE FORGET ABOUT
1968, RICHARD NIXON WON WITH
43.5% OF THE VOTE.
YET, HE WON IN A LANDSLIDE.
AND THAT'S EXACTLY THE SORT
OF THING WE ARE LOOKING AT
TODAY.
STEVE: ALL RIGHT.
