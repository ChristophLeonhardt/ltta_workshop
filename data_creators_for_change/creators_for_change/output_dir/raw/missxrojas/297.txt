very creative internet response and<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

19
00:00:31,769 --> 00:00:33,750
is<font color="#CCCCCC"> Caramelldansen my favorite</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> carol</font>

00:00:46,950 --> 00:00:48,300
Tennant and Christopher Eccleston and

28
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:49,440
it's all the misheard lyrics from

00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:51,239
<font color="#CCCCCC">caramelldansen a big part of my dearie</font>

30
00:00:51,239 --> 00:00:53,430
why no songs are so successful is along

31
00:00:53,430 --> 00:00:54,449
the same lines of what makes

32
00:00:54,449 --> 00:00:56,670
<font color="#CCCCCC">caramelldansen videos work the lack of</font>

33
00:00:56,670 --> 00:00:59,129
understanding the thing that makes you

34
00:00:59,129 --> 00:01:00,750
think that you're listening<font color="#CCCCCC"> to sit words</font>

35
00:01:00,750 --> 00:01:01,829
<font color="#E5E5E5">and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> english then</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you realize that</font>

36
00:01:01,829 --> 00:01:03,300
<font color="#CCCCCC">they're not words in English at all and</font>

37
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:04,769
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's because the experience is Saudi</font>

38
00:01:04,769 --> 00:01:06,090
familiarising they're having that

39
00:01:06,090 --> 00:01:07,890
distance from thinking about<font color="#E5E5E5"> what the</font>

40
00:01:07,890 --> 00:01:09,510
words mean and what they're saying and

41
00:01:09,510 --> 00:01:11,220
what order they go it means that you can

42
00:01:11,220 --> 00:01:12,869
listen<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the rhythm not necessarily the</font>

43
00:01:12,869 --> 00:01:14,610
rhythm of the drums of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the guitar of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

base the<font color="#E5E5E5"> rhythm of the language itself I</font>

45
00:01:17,189 --> 00:01:18,689
<font color="#E5E5E5">think George Watsky for example makes</font>

46
00:01:18,689 --> 00:01:19,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">you extremely aware of the kind of</font>

47
00:01:19,890 --> 00:01:22,020
rhythm and his music<font color="#E5E5E5"> and it it doesn't</font>

48
00:01:22,020 --> 00:01:23,820
detract from it just<font color="#E5E5E5"> adds to the</font>

49
00:01:23,820 --> 00:01:26,250
experience the Watsky experience but

50
00:01:26,250 --> 00:01:27,659
there's a rhythm and<font color="#CCCCCC"> rods</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that we just</font>

51
00:01:27,659 --> 00:01:29,250
don't pay attention to<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think that's</font>

52
00:01:29,250 --> 00:01:30,540
one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the many reasons</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> why people are</font>

53
00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:32,750
still reading<font color="#E5E5E5"> TS Eliot and this guy</font>

54
00:01:32,750 --> 00:01:35,250
Emily Dickinson as well poets you draw

55
00:01:35,250 --> 00:01:37,409
attention to the rhythm<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the word of</font>

56
00:01:37,409 --> 00:01:39,090
the spoken word of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> written word and</font>

57
00:01:39,090 --> 00:01:40,680
of the sunward then also there's this

58
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:42,450
whole<font color="#CCCCCC"> other level of just creation</font>

59
00:01:42,450 --> 00:01:44,579
generally dance moves dance routines I

60
00:01:44,579 --> 00:01:45,810
spoke about<font color="#E5E5E5"> this briefly in a video</font>

61
00:01:45,810 --> 00:01:46,920
about dance routines I made a little

62
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:49,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">while</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ago they're so creative they're</font>

63
00:01:49,020 --> 00:01:50,220
taking something that you listen to

64
00:01:50,220 --> 00:01:51,540
something someone else has made and

65
00:01:51,540 --> 00:01:53,189
you're collaborating with that and

66
00:01:53,189 --> 00:01:54,119
you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> making</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> your</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> body move and</font>

67
00:01:54,119 --> 00:01:55,890
response to that whether that's in line

68
00:01:55,890 --> 00:01:58,290
with their dance moves that they set or

69
00:01:58,290 --> 00:02:00,299
wants of your own that's maybe why dance

70
00:02:00,299 --> 00:02:01,860
crazes are so popular on the internet

71
00:02:01,860 --> 00:02:03,960
which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the home of collaboration</font>

72
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:05,549
or at least the<font color="#E5E5E5"> little part of the</font>

73
00:02:05,549 --> 00:02:07,439
<font color="#CCCCCC">internet</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in which</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I reside so if my</font>

74
00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:08,940
lingo aspect is being worried that

75
00:02:08,940 --> 00:02:10,560
rhythm is also collaborating with people

76
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:12,340
around the world and above<font color="#E5E5E5"> all</font>

77
00:02:12,340 --> 00:02:14,620
about creation and being creative being

78
00:02:14,620 --> 00:02:17,019
creative people in every<font color="#CCCCCC"> aspect of our</font>

79
00:02:17,019 --> 00:02:18,580
senses<font color="#E5E5E5"> really those are just my thoughts</font>

80
00:02:18,580 --> 00:02:20,769
pretty much it's Monday the kippie<font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font>

81
00:02:20,769 --> 00:02:22,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">the crap who notes so I suppose my</font>

82
00:02:22,450 --> 00:02:23,709
question is why do you think bilingual

83
00:02:23,709 --> 00:02:25,810
songs are so popular for creating dance

84
00:02:25,810 --> 00:02:27,370
routines and dance crazes and things

85
00:02:27,370 --> 00:02:29,769
<font color="#E5E5E5">that just explode worldwide and would</font>

86
00:02:29,769 --> 00:02:30,849
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> say that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the distance</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> between the</font>

87
00:02:30,849 --> 00:02:32,470
language we use now and their language

88
00:02:32,470 --> 00:02:34,060
that we used in Shakespeare's time is

89
00:02:34,060 --> 00:02:36,489
the reason why we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> focus so much on</font>

90
00:02:36,489 --> 00:02:38,560
his rhythm and appreciated his use of

91
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:40,840
rhythm and played with rhythm as much as

92
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:42,370
we have let me know in comments<font color="#CCCCCC"> of video</font>

93
