he you it's suggesting could pay up to 6,000 euros per migrant to host them insecure migrant centers here in Europe the EU as we know has been searching for a political solution for some time now to deal with the tens of thousands of migrants that have been coming across the Mediterranean to European shores for the last few years already in 2018 we've seen around 18,000 people arrived from over the Mediterranean Sea in 2017 that was a hundred and twenty thousand people and in 2016 it was even more around a hundred and eighty one thousand people making that crossing and landing in Europe and as we know that many countries on the Mediterranean have dealt with the burden of that and so the EU has been looking for this political solution to try and ease some of the tensions within the bloc particularly by Italy who recently talked about the fact that it would close its ports to migrants volure rafinha I want to put an end to this human trafficking which puts thousands of lives at risk so in the same way that will raise the issue for the Aquarius we will raise it for all other vessels that follow there are the countries I'm hinting at France where instead of accepting they repel the migrants our objective is we hope the same one as in Austria to protect the external borders of Europe and Italy is one of them well we have had a little bit of a row back from Italy in the last few days it's now said that while this new idea is on the table and it's being thrashed out it will allow migrant boats to dock for the next five weeks or so and those centres the idea would be to be able to process more efficiently asylum claims for those who reach European soil from Mediterranean countries well the European Commission white paper which has suggested this idea says it will come out of the European budget now as we know the European budget is paid as a percentage of GDP by the members of the European Union so larger countries with larger TTP's pay more such as Germany for example now that might cause some anger and annoyance in Germany where we know that there has been so resistance to the tens of thousands of migrants who've come into the country over the last few years people unhappy with the fact that they feel they're their borders aren't secure and unhappy with paying for this so what we'll see is those larger countries possibly contributing more to this new plan which may appease the smaller countries making them much more happy to receive migrants but at the end of the day will people be questioning where the countries like Germany are essentially now going to be buying themselves out of this crisis you
