explosives or chemicals things always go wrong so make sure you handle these with respect and don't do anything like this that's not a shoe what do you think that is time-fuse remember time-fuse has a black powder core when we ignited it burns they divert so much of it they send it to an explosive Factory they coat the interior of the tube with an explosive called hmx emulsions kind of look like vanilla frosting and has chunks in it this is a water gel both of them come in plastic tubes this is called a binary explosive we have nitromethane we have ammonium nitrate and they're in two separate packages neither one isn't explosive it's no RDX but it's made into a sheen explodes do any way to tell the difference between RDX sheet and ppm sheet is by what it says on the box so what we have here is detonating court dead nanny court has PETN inside is a core if you look at the end you'll see a white powder number ten okay ready in three two one whoo there we go
