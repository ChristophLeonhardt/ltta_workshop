Ralph Northam victory in Virginia last night wasn't the extent of the beating that the Republicans took there it also took place in the legislature as well before the election Republicans enjoyed a 66 to 34 super majority in the House of Delegates Democrats picked up 15 of the 17 seats that they would need to flip that over three seats all currently held by Republicans are currently too close to call and I believe since we made that graphic I think one more seat went to the Democrats so there's still no guarantee these these are too close to call whether it might flip but it still might at this point regardless even if the rest go to Republicans this is the largest Democratic gain in a single election the state since 1899 that's to stash more than two centuries ago that's a long time that's a long time I said truth 220th said tree the one before that was a 19th century that was the 19th we're done it works and now what's interesting is that that's a big flip you know you don't normally see that since 1899 it looks like but they're still perhaps gonna be in the minority even though Democratic candidates outperformed Republicans by about nine point four percentage points which is significant mean we are a country of 51 52 to 48 you know those sorts of races when you win by almost 10 points statewide you sort of expect that you might have control of that state's legislature but you don't in a lot of states and especially not in Virginia because of the gerrymandering that's been going on there and around the country for decades at this point and that's one of the things where Northam regardless of where he stands on the other issues might be very significant because previously you've had Republican legislators and Republican governors to sign on to these redistricting plans that are very often racist designed to suppress people's ability to influence politics and it looks like that probably won't happen this next time around which isn't just good for north and it's not just good for the Democrats that one but for anyone who seeks you know statewide or state legislature an election in the future in Virginia like you need to have fair maps if you're going to have a chance there and we might actually get that in the next few years well they say that the Supreme Court is going to decide on this gerrymandering thing soon in it either there's a case that in the near future could actually rear a z' this and they're saying that it looked like this conservative court was giving a favor to the people saying that gerrymandering is illegal right and they shouldn't do it so that's surprising what that is surprising because those guys are freaking fascists right I'm the court I don't give a shit so yeah it's weird that they're doing that so who knows maybe we'll get rid of gerrymandering I know in California didn't Arnold Schwarzenegger do a thing where we now have to draw the district's correctly that sounds familiar I wasn't around for that but that does sound familiar there have been a few state experiments where they'll either either have particular tests for how fair you know the map is there's also I think it's Arizona maybe Nevada that has an independent commission a nonpartisan Commission that's go over it I mean the idea that you could allow the party that controls a state currently to choose what the map will be for next time who thinks that's a good idea other than those people there would be it yeah and this is one of those issues that it's like a foundational issue like money and politics where these sorts of issues affect the outcomes we have on all of the other more specific issues you know like will we be able to raise the minimum wage that sort of thing well I mean if you have the people who are winning elections based on biased maps or because of corporate donations that affects not just one topic but it affects all of the topics which is why if you can fix these sorts of issues if you can get money out of politics if you can stop the gerrymandering then that has ripple effects that like a virtuous cycle and so many other things this is just Virginia but it's certainly considering the extent of the gerrymandering here that is good to see well and you want to talk about how we've mentioned there's some silver linings and in this whole thing one of the things that the Trump administration has done to a lot of the populace now there's some people that like to pretend that everything was just hunky-dory in our democracy was flawless until Trump showed up but a lot of people realize that's certainly not the case it's a broken system that led us to Trump so now people were talking about stuff like gerrymandering more than ever or people were talking about how for the second time in less than 20 years the popular vote winner doesn't sit in the white house people are talking about a lot of that stuff and how all this stuff which is just corruption should have been gone years ago yeah and you're even seeing alternative voting methods on the ballot in certain states rate choice and stuff like that so I think that we're recognizing that that this democracy we need to spread everywhere else we haven't really mastered it here have a lot of work to do yeah we have this sort of popular myth that things I guess you know the system was fucked up but it mostly worked for a couple hundred years but that is a myth like it it was always rigged to benefit certain people advantage them over others we just sort of pretended that if we keep our head down if we work hard things will be fine and if you were a particular sort of white person for a long time that might even be the case but for a lot of Americans it was never true and it's certainly not true now
