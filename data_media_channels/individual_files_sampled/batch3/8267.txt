WHITE AND BLACK, POOR AND RICH, TOGETHER, THAT WE CAN WORK TOGETHER. NOT VIOLENCE, NOT DISORDER, BUT COMPASSION AND LOVE AND PEACE. THAT'S WHAT THIS COUNTRY SHOULD STAND FOR. Martha: TONIGHT MARKS 50 YEARS SINCE THE ASSASSINATION OF ROBERT F. KENNEDY. THE DEMOCRATIC SENATOR IN THE MIDST OF A PRESIDENTIAL BID TO GUNNED IT DOWN AT THE AMBASSADOR HOTEL IN LOS ANGELES, JUST AFTER THE CALIFORNIA PRIMARY AND TWO MONTHS AFTER MARTIN LUTHER KING JR.'S ASSASSINATION. MY NEXT GUEST HAS BEEN DIGGING BACK INTO THIS TRAGIC MOMENT IN AMERICAN HISTORY INCLUDING THE SOMBER CROSS-COUNTRY FLIGHT THAT CARRIED RFK'S BODY BACK EAST. ON BOARD, WIDOWS ETHEL KENNEDY, JACQUELINE KENNEDY AND CORETTA SCOTT KING. JOINING ME NOW, DAVID MARGO LIKE JOINING ME NOW, DAVID MARGO LIK JOINING ME NOW, DAVID MARGO LIK, JOINING ME NOW, DAVID MARGO LIKW JOINING ME NOW, DAVID MARGO LIKO JOINING ME NOW, DAVID MARGO LIKW JOINING ME NOW, DAVID MARGO LIKL DISCUSS THIS FASCINATING TOPIC. DAVID, NICE TO SEE YOU TONIGHT. NICE TO SEE YOU, MARTHA. Martha: IF THERE IS SO MUCH SYMBOLISM AND YET THE REALITY THAT THESE THREE WOMEN FLEW BACK ON A PLANE TOGETHER AFTER BOBBY KENNEDY'S ASSASSINATION, HOW DO WE KNOW WHAT THEY DID AND WHAT THEY SET ON THAT FLIGHT? I THOUGHT IT WAS JUST THE MOST EXTRAORDINARY THING THAT THESE THREE WOMEN WERE ON THAT FLIGHT AND NO ONE HAD WRITTEN ABOUT IT BEFORE. I MENTIONED IT IN MY BOOK BUT I WANTED TO GO EVEN FURTHER THAN THAT. SO I DUG DOWN VERY DEEP. I TALKED TO THE ONLY SURVIVING SECRET SERVICE MAN WHO WAS ON THE FLIGHT. I TALKED TO ANY PASSENGERS I COULD FIND WHO WERE STILL AROUND, AND THERE WAS ONE MOMENT WHEN THESE THREE WOMEN WERE ACTUALLY STANDING OR SITTING IN THE SAME PLACE ON THE FLIGHT AND TALKING TO ONE ANOTHER. WE WILL NEVER KNOW WHAT THEY SAID THAT WE CAN ONLY IMAGINE THE KIND OF COMMISERATING THAT WENT ON. THEY CLEARLY SHARED SOMETHING THAT THEY COULD SHARE. YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT THE TRAGIC SENSE THAT THAT PLANE OR ACROSS THE COUNTRY WITH THESE THREE WOMEN ON IT. JACKIE BOARDED THE PLANE IN A SEPARATE AREA AND SHE WANTED TO KNOW THAT THIS IS NOT THE SAME PLANE THAT CARRIED HER BACK FROM DALLAS? IS PUZZLING AND ANOTHER MYSTERY TO THE STORY THAT ALL OF THE FAMILY GOT ON THE FRONT OF THE PLANE WITH THE CASKET AND SURROUNDED THE CASKET AND HELD HANDS AS IT WAS LIFTED INTO THE FRONT OF THE PLANE. THEN JACQUELINE KENNEDY ENTERED FROM THE REAR END AND FOR WHATEVER REASON SHE WASN'T PART OF THE FAMILY UNIT. SHE SORT OF WENT IN THERE AND MADE A VERY SEPARATE ENTRANCE. SHE GOT ON THE PLANE AS YOU SAY ONLY AFTER SHE WAS ASSURED THAT IT WAS NOT THE SAME AIR FORCE ONE. THERE ARE SEVERAL DIFFERENT AIR FORCE ONES. SHE HAD TO BE ASSURED THAT IT WAS NOT THE SAME ONE THAT BROUGHT HER BACK WITH HER HUSBAND'S BODY FROM DALLAS. AND THERE WAS ONE MOMENT WHEN SHE WOULDN'T GET OUT OF THE CAR UNTIL SHE GOT THAT ASSURANCE. AND Martha: WHAT ABOUT THE RELATIONSHIP OF RFK JR. WHO ALSO APPROVED THE WIRETAPS ON HIM? WELL, IT'S A VERY COMPLICATED RELATIONSHIP. THERE IS THE SONG ABRAHAM, MARTIN AND JOHN AND WE LIKE TO THINK THAT THESE GUYS ARE TIED TOGETHER BUT THEIR RELATIONSHIP WAS MUCH ROCKIER THAN THAT AND MORE COMPLICATED THAN THAT. THEY WERE DEPENDENT UPON EACH OTHER, THEY RESENTED EACH OTHER AND THEY INTERACTED ALL OF THE TIME, NOT LITERALLY DIRECTLY, THERE IS VERY LITTLE CORRESPONDENCE BETWEEN THEM. BUT THERE IS NOT EVEN A GOOD PHOTOGRAPH OF MARTIN LUTHER KING AND ROBERT KENNEDY ALONE TOGETHER. THEY WERE VITAL TO ONE ANOTHER'S INTERESTS AND THEY WERE COMPLETELY INTERDEPENDENT REALLY, AND THAT'S THE STORY IN THE BOOK THAT I WAS EXPLORING. Martha: BEFORE I LET YOU GO, YOU SAID WE HAVE TO BE CAREFUL NOT TO CANONIZE THEM. WHILE I THINK IT'S GOOD TO RESIST THE TEMPTATION TO CANONIZE ANYBODY. ROBERT KENNEDY IS MORE INTERESTING IN FACT BECAUSE HE WASN'T THE SAINT AND BECAUSE OF HIS ATTITUDE TOWARD RACE AND KING VARIED AND EVOLVED OVER THE YEARS. HE HAD HIS MOMENTS, HE HAD HIS RELAPSES.
