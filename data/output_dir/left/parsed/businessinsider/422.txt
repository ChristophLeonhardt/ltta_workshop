My life was changed by coming to Fiji
and I fell so in love with the people here
that I decided I want to have a
piece of this and I want to find a way
to bring people here.
And then, you know, I
eventually bought the resort and then I
started building it into the top resort
in the country for the last 10 years
and top 10 in the South Pacific.
How you guys doing?
Welcome!
Lomalagi — it's called "heaven" in Fijian.
Come on in.
I bought this place when I was
29, so it's been 33 years.
I like to make
something that feels like it's very
relaxed but you know the scale of things
is my scale size chairs as you've
probably noticed.
Reporter: And what's your favorite spot in the home?
Tony: I'll show you one of them.
I'll show you a couple of them if you want.
This is one of my favorite little hangout spots.
Totally private, down by the water.
Come down here and meditate or read and so forth.
I actually have a set of stairs that go down under
the caves down to the beach, but the last
storm took that out and it took out the
other place I'm gonna take you that's been
my favorite, which is my upstairs bed
up on top of the building.
You know, I love to hang out 
up here where you have these
unending views and I have a giant bed
that's here that's covered, that's an
outdoor bed, which is clearly disappeared.
It was ripped off — 
literally ripped out of the building.
This is another hangout area that we really love.
I got outdoor beds everywhere around the house
too, that the wife and I love.
I opened this up because I have 'fish balls.'
I have these golf balls 
that are full of fish food
and so we use these as holes here
and we come out knock balls here.
And then they dissolve in the ocean and
provide the food, so they're ecologically
sound but also the fish love it.
Just pop on the other side, 
just so you see it real quick.
I'll show you
My "extra skinny" bed (laughs)
Just you know, all the beautiful little touches.
There's a bathtub 
overlooking the ocean — like that.
Reporter: When you got this property, was it
kind of a bargain back then
or did you have to fight for it? Like, this property itself.
Tony: The first 125 acres that
are part of this resort was a coconut
plantation and it was owned by a group
of professors from Scripps Oceanography.
This entire reef right here, they studied
it for like 14 years and found more
diverse life anywhere else they studied.
And they sold it to a couple travel
agents and they didn't have enough money
to finish it. $10 million was
one chunk and then another one was
another five but it was a giant stretch
in those days and then gradually as I
became more financially 
astute and strong
I was able to put more and more into it
Did you go up to the waterfall?
Reporter: Have
we gone to the waterfall?
No, we didn't make it to the waterfall
Tony: OK, we should run you up to the waterfall.
Will you call them
and ask them if they've got —
my car's broken down, I think. 
I don't know if I fit in this car.
See if they've got somebody who can take us out to the waterfall real fast.
I love this.
Feels so good!
Bula!
Stop. Slow down, slow down.
Great job!
Great job! Really love what
you've done over here. It's looking
really beautiful. Thank you so much, Joe.
Take care, brother.
I'm sorry I didn't get to see you longer today.
Reporter: So you've really become like
an integral part of the community here?
Tony: Oh without a doubt.
They're my family 
on both sides.
They called me "Boss Levu," which means "Big Boss"
Reporter: You're 'Big Boss?' You're 'Big Boss' here in Fiji.
Tony: 'Cause this is Vanua Levu, right?
It's the big island, right?
Reporter: The big island. You're the 
"Big Boss" on the big island.
(Laughs) That's awesome.
Tony: "Are we on time? Am I late?
OK, we'll be ready to go in five minutes.
Time to say goodbye again. I'm so sorry
but I look forward to coming back home
to see all the family again. It's been a
beautiful, beautiful trip.
Bula vinaka.
(Singing)
