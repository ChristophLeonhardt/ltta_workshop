no longer in the movie like at all

363
00:15:51,130 --> 00:15:53,110
So I'm a little heartbroken right my

364
00:15:53,110 --> 00:15:54,340
heart aches a little

365
00:15:54,340 --> 00:15:57,520
spit in two, but just to educate you guys this is how Hollywood works

366
00:15:57,520 --> 00:15:59,620
so you film a movie and

367
00:15:59,620 --> 00:16:01,180
then you go back to see which teams are

368
00:16:01,180 --> 00:16:03,310
good and which scenes are flashed not

369
00:16:03,310 --> 00:16:05,680
necessary for the film and unfortunately

370
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:08,320
might be must have not added to the plot

371
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:10,960
of this bill so they cut it however the

372
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:13,930
movie is actually really good so space

373
00:16:13,930 --> 00:16:15,940
between us it's coming out very soon put

374
00:16:15,940 --> 00:16:17,530
it on the back burner when it comes out

375
00:16:17,530 --> 00:16:19,270
make sure you go watch it and you still

376
00:16:19,270 --> 00:16:20,830
see me in the movies you can catch the

377
00:16:20,830 --> 00:16:22,060
probably will see me you cannot miss

378
00:16:22,060 --> 00:16:23,320
this head of hair but the only

379
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:25,090
difference is I don't have speaking like

380
00:16:25,090 --> 00:16:27,160
that and that note that the end of the

381
00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:29,740

383

384
00:16:34,210 --> 00:16:35,620
the bucket listing what they can't say

385
00:16:35,620 --> 00:16:38,170
