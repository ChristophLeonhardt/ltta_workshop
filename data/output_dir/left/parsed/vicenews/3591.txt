that song made me realize what a huge
dick I am
parents caring raucous some of my
favorite they do the the bass drum thing
that we always refer to as Airy horse
farts and it always makes me laugh
it sounds like some confused young white
dudes that SOG is an amalgam of so many
things poppier kind of melody based
alternative or independent music that
has come from the land of the Pixies
forward like my own bands are like that
too I cannot tell you who that is though
it's the front bottoms
well obviously off the top it's the old
Sesame Street song 1 2 3 4 5 7 8 9 10 11
there's something about dudes talking
about religion even if they're talking
about how stupid is that turns me off so
hard that I can't and I listen to it
like really listen and I'm like okay
this is really clever his cadence is
really good he's excellent I feel like a
dick and I am a dick but I'm just
fatigued on the topic in general my name
is Yogi fun
I'm Andy that's I damn I are you playing
with me you don't even like
it's good it's a good dialogue I like
that people talk to each other again
hearing these two people kind of telling
the other I'm confused
well this is what I'll take here's my
boundaries this is what I'll do that was
really cool that's what you want young
people to hear way to be
you
