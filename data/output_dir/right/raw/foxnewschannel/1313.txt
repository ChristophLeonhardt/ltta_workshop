00:00:21,640 --> 00:00:22,775
IT WAS RECORDED THE MORNING

BEFORE HE MURDERED 17 PEOPLE

13
00:00:24,376 --> 00:00:25,678

14
00:00:25,678 --> 00:00:27,379
THIS IS JUST A FREEZE FRAME

15
00:00:27,379 --> 00:00:27,880

00:00:35,354 --> 00:00:37,423
JOINING ME NOW IS FLORIDA

23

25
00:00:39,358 --> 00:00:40,726
TRY TO MAKE SURE THAT THIS

26
00:00:40,726 --> 00:00:41,427
NEVER HAPPENS AGAIN.

27
00:00:41,427 --> 00:00:42,828
I GUESS INITIALLY, GOVERNOR,

28
00:00:42,828 --> 00:00:46,665
YOUR THOUGHTS ON THIS LATEST

29
00:00:46,665 --> 00:00:46,999
LATEST.

30
00:00:46,999 --> 00:00:48,267
>> IT'S DISGUSTING.

31
00:00:48,267 --> 00:00:50,135
IT'S JUST HORRIBLE.

32
00:00:50,135 --> 00:00:51,937
YOU THINK ABOUT THESE POOR

33
00:00:51,937 --> 00:00:52,304
FAMILIES.

34
00:00:52,304 --> 00:00:54,740
YOU KNOW, AND YOU -- I CAN'T

35
00:00:54,740 --> 00:00:56,108
IMAGINE IF IT HAPPENED TO

36
00:00:56,108 --> 00:00:58,210
YOUR CHILD OR YOUR

37
00:00:58,210 --> 00:00:59,111
GRANDCHILD, YOU KNOW, OUR

38
00:00:59,111 --> 00:01:00,479
SCHOOLS NEED TO BE SAFE.

39
00:01:00,479 --> 00:01:01,880
THEY NEED -- WE ALL AS

40
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:02,948
PARENTS WANT TO MAKE SURE

41
00:01:02,948 --> 00:01:04,650
OUR KIDS ARE SAFE AT HOME.

42
00:01:04,650 --> 00:01:05,551
THEY NEED TO BE SAFE WHEN

43
00:01:05,551 --> 00:01:06,552
THEY GO TO SCHOOL.

44
00:01:06,552 --> 00:01:08,020
MY GOAL IS IT NEVER HAPPENS

45
00:01:08,020 --> 00:01:09,054
AGAIN IN FLORIDA.

46
00:01:09,054 --> 00:01:11,290
WE WORKED HARD TO PASS

47
00:01:11,290 --> 00:01:12,391
LEGISLATION THAT, YOU KNOW,

48
00:01:12,391 --> 00:01:13,359
MOVED THE BALL DOWN THE

49
00:01:13,359 --> 00:01:14,827
COURT TO TRY TO MAKE IT

50
00:01:14,827 --> 00:01:15,995
SAFER FOR ALL PARENTS AND

51
00:01:15,995 --> 00:01:19,598
ALL KIDS.

OFFICERS.

58
00:01:25,304 --> 00:01:25,971
>> Martha: HOW ARE YOU DOING

59
00:01:25,971 --> 00:01:26,338
WITH THAT?

60
00:01:26,338 --> 00:01:29,274
>> THEY ARE REQUIRED TO

61
00:01:29,274 --> 00:01:30,275
IMPLEMENT IT BY THE SCHOOL

62
00:01:30,275 --> 00:01:30,876
YEAR.

63
00:01:30,876 --> 00:01:32,011
THEY WERE ALREADY

64
00:01:32,011 --> 00:01:33,679
IMPLEMENTED AS SOON AS THIS

65
00:01:33,679 --> 00:01:34,046

66
00:01:34,046 --> 00:01:35,114

SAFETY RIGHT AFTERWARDS.

70
00:01:39,518 --> 00:01:40,552
THE PARENTS DIDN'T THINK

71
00:01:40,552 --> 00:01:41,787
THERE WAS ENOUGH RIGHT

72
00:01:41,787 --> 00:01:43,222
AFTERWARDS, SO I ADDED

73
00:01:43,222 --> 00:01:44,123
HIGHWAY PATROL.

74
00:01:44,123 --> 00:01:46,358
THE NUMBER ONE SCHOOLS ARE

00:01:46,358 --> 00:01:47,059
GOING TO HAVE LAW

76
00:01:47,059 --> 00:01:47,860

81
00:01:52,498 --> 00:01:53,732
WE WERE ALREADY GIVING THEM

82
00:01:53,732 --> 00:01:55,934
MONEY EVERY YEAR FOR

83
00:01:55,934 --> 00:01:56,301
HARDENING.

BULLET PROOF GLASS, METAL

85
00:01:58,837 --> 00:01:59,772
DETECTORS, FEWER ENTRANCES

86
00:01:59,772 --> 00:02:00,305

00:02:00,305 --> 00:02:02,307
NUMBER FOUR, WE SAID IF YOU

88
00:02:02,307 --> 00:02:03,242

AND YOU SHOULDN'T.

94
00:02:12,217 --> 00:02:12,651
>> Martha: NO.

95
00:02:12,651 --> 00:02:13,719
THAT'S SUCH A HUGE PART OF

96
00:02:13,719 --> 00:02:14,019
THIS.

97
00:02:14,019 --> 00:02:14,787
WHAT ABOUT THE

98
00:02:14,787 --> 00:02:15,587
ACCOUNTABILITY OF THE

99
00:02:15,587 --> 00:02:15,921
SHERIFF.

100
00:02:15,921 --> 00:02:16,755
THE POLICE OFFICERS WHO WENT

00:02:16,755 --> 00:02:18,757
TO HIS HOUSE 27 TIMES.

102
00:02:18,757 --> 00:02:20,359
THE SECURITY GUARD WHO RAN

103
00:02:20,359 --> 00:02:20,659
AWAY.

104
00:02:20,659 --> 00:02:22,895
WHERE IS THE ACCOUNTABILITY

105
00:02:22,895 --> 00:02:24,663
FOR THE LEGAL, THE

106
00:02:24,663 --> 00:02:26,198
GOVERNMENT ARM THAT REALLY

107
00:02:26,198 --> 00:02:27,266
FAILED YOUR SCHOOL?

108
00:02:27,266 --> 00:02:31,904
>> WHAT ABOUT THE FBI.

109
00:02:31,904 --> 00:02:32,504
>> Martha: YEAH.

110
00:02:32,504 --> 00:02:33,772

00:02:33,772 --> 00:02:35,340
ONE TIME VERY SPECIFICALLY

112
00:02:35,340 --> 00:02:37,209
FIVE WEEKS AHEAD OF TIME.

113
00:02:37,209 --> 00:02:37,843
INFEWER UNITED STATES YOU

114
00:02:37,843 --> 00:02:38,911
ABOUT THE ACCOUNTABILITY.

115
00:02:38,911 --> 00:02:43,015
HERE IS WHAT I WAS ABLE TO

116
00:02:43,015 --> 00:02:43,282
DO.

117
00:02:43,282 --> 00:02:44,216
WITH REGARD TO THE SHERIFF'S

118
00:02:44,216 --> 00:02:46,218
OFFICE, WHAT WE DID IS HAVE

119
00:02:46,218 --> 00:02:47,152
VERIFICATION GOING ON

120
00:02:47,152 --> 00:02:47,986
INDEPENDENT BY THE FLORIDA

121
00:02:47,986 --> 00:02:48,754
DEPARTMENT OF LAW

122
00:02:48,754 --> 00:02:49,154
ENFORCEMENT.

123
00:02:49,154 --> 00:02:50,222
THEY ARE GOING THROUGH, YOU

124
00:02:50,222 --> 00:02:51,390
KNOW, THE WAY THEY DO IT IS

125
00:02:51,390 --> 00:02:52,591
START WITH ALL THE VIDEOS

126
00:02:52,591 --> 00:02:53,959
AND START DOING ALL THE

127
00:02:53,959 --> 00:02:54,827
INTERVIEWS TO FIND OUT

128
00:02:54,827 --> 00:02:55,494
EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENED.

129
00:02:55,494 --> 00:02:58,564
AS GOVERNOR, IF I FIND

130
00:02:58,564 --> 00:02:59,698
MALFEASANCE, THEN I HAVE THE

131
00:02:59,698 --> 00:03:01,033
OPPORTUNITY TO HOLD PEOPLE

132
00:03:01,033 --> 00:03:02,701
ACCOUNTABLE, AND I WILL.

133
00:03:02,701 --> 00:03:03,402
>> Martha: MEANING THEY WILL

134
00:03:03,402 --> 00:03:03,769
BE FIRED.

135
00:03:03,769 --> 00:03:05,070
>> YEAH, ABSOLUTELY.

136
00:03:05,070 --> 00:03:06,472
SO, BUT HERE'S WHAT'S

137
00:03:06,472 --> 00:03:07,606
FRUSTRATING TO ME.

138
00:03:07,606 --> 00:03:09,408
HAVE WE HEARD ANYTHING FROM

139
00:03:09,408 --> 00:03:10,342
THE FBI.

140
00:03:10,342 --> 00:03:10,776
>> Martha: NO.

141
00:03:10,776 --> 00:03:11,376
>> NOTHING.

142
00:03:11,376 --> 00:03:12,744
NOW, THINK ABOUT IT I HAVE

143
00:03:12,744 --> 00:03:15,380
HAD THREE SHOOTINGS.

144
00:03:15,380 --> 00:03:15,948
>> Martha: INCREDIBLE.

145
00:03:15,948 --> 00:03:16,715
>> I HAVE HAD THE PULSE, THE

146
00:03:16,715 --> 00:03:18,217
AIRPORT AND I HAVE HAD THIS.

147
00:03:18,217 --> 00:03:19,518
TO THIS DATE I HAVE NEVER

148
00:03:19,518 --> 00:03:20,719
HEARD OF ANY ACCOUNTABILITY.

149
00:03:20,719 --> 00:03:22,788
SO I BELIEVE IN

150
00:03:22,788 --> 00:03:23,255
ACCOUNTABILITY.

151
00:03:23,255 --> 00:03:24,857
WE DO IT WITH OUR FAMILIES.

152
00:03:24,857 --> 00:03:26,291
SO I AM GOING THROUGH A

153
00:03:26,291 --> 00:03:27,960
PROCESS IN THE STATE, A

154
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:28,794
THOROUGH INVESTIGATION WE

155
00:03:28,794 --> 00:03:30,629
WILL HOLD PEOPLE

156
00:03:30,629 --> 00:03:31,096
ACCOUNTABLE.

157
00:03:31,096 --> 00:03:31,797
>> Martha: I WANT TO ASK YOU

158
00:03:31,797 --> 00:03:32,764
A QUICK QUESTION ABOUT THE

159
00:03:32,764 --> 00:03:34,633
ELECTION AND SOMEWHAT

160
00:03:34,633 --> 00:03:35,400
PERIPHERALLY RELATED BECAUSE

161
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:39,538
YOU ARE RUNNING FOR SENATE

162
00:03:39,538 --> 00:03:40,472
AGAINST NELSON WHO HAS BEEN

163
00:03:40,472 --> 00:03:42,074
THE DEMOCRATIC SENATOR FROM

164
00:03:42,074 --> 00:03:43,142
FLORIDA FOR MANY YEARS.

165
00:03:43,142 --> 00:03:44,209
THERE IS A LOFT PEOPLE WHO

166
00:03:44,209 --> 00:03:45,177
HAVE MOVED FROM PUERTO RICO

167
00:03:45,177 --> 00:03:46,879
TO FLORIDA AFTER HURRICANE

168
00:03:46,879 --> 00:03:47,179
MARIA.

169
00:03:47,179 --> 00:03:48,347
AND THERE ARE EFFORTS BY THE

170
00:03:48,347 --> 00:03:49,481
DEMOCRATIC PARTY TO SIGN

171
00:03:49,481 --> 00:03:50,949
THEM UP AS DEMOCRATS BECAUSE

172
00:03:50,949 --> 00:03:52,584
MOST OF THEM DO NOT CHOOSE A

173
00:03:52,584 --> 00:03:53,619
PARTY AFFILIATION.

174
00:03:53,619 --> 00:03:54,720
IS THAT GOING TO HAVE AN

175
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:55,621
IMPACT ON THE FLORIDA

176
00:03:55,621 --> 00:03:55,988
ELECTION?

177
00:03:55,988 --> 00:03:57,656
>> WELL, FIRST OFF, ANYTHING

178
00:03:57,656 --> 00:03:58,524
THAT HAPPENED WITH PUERTO

179
00:03:58,524 --> 00:03:59,758
RICO SHOULD NOT BE ABOUT

180
00:03:59,758 --> 00:04:00,125
POLITICS.

181
00:04:00,125 --> 00:04:01,126
I'M GOING BACK THERE

182
00:04:01,126 --> 00:04:02,528

183
00:04:02,528 --> 00:04:04,429
AND I'M GOING BACK THERE TO

184
00:04:04,429 --> 00:04:05,130
TRY TO HELP THEM.

185
00:04:05,130 --> 00:04:07,799
I WORK WITH THE GOVERNOR.

186
00:04:07,799 --> 00:04:09,067
GOVERNOR INVITED ME BACK

187
00:04:09,067 --> 00:04:09,368
AGAIN.

188
00:04:09,368 --> 00:04:10,402
TO SAY HOW DO WE HELP YOU

189
00:04:10,402 --> 00:04:12,004
GET YOUR ECONOMY GOING.

190
00:04:12,004 --> 00:04:12,638
>> Martha: DO YOU BELIEVE

191
00:04:12,638 --> 00:04:13,372
THE NEW NUMBERS FROM THE

192
00:04:13,372 --> 00:04:16,675
STUDY THAT 4600 PEOPLE LOST LOST

193
00:04:16,675 --> 00:04:17,576
THEIR LIVES IN THAT

194
00:04:17,576 --> 00:04:18,810
HURRICANE NOT 64 OR WHATEVER

195
00:04:18,810 --> 00:04:19,577
THEY SAID IT WAS?

196
00:04:19,577 --> 00:04:21,079
>> WHATEVER THE NUMBER IS

197
00:04:21,079 --> 00:04:23,415
YOU KNOW, IT'S HORRIBLE.

198
00:04:23,415 --> 00:04:26,084
YOU KNOW, WE WENT THROUGH

199
00:04:26,084 --> 00:04:26,418
IRMA.

00:04:26,418 --> 00:04:27,452
THAT WHOLE HURRICANE WAS I

201
00:04:27,452 --> 00:04:30,489
WANT TO KEEP EVERYBODY

00:04:30,489 --> 00:04:30,789
ALIVE.

203
00:04:30,789 --> 00:04:31,557
REBUILD YOUR HOUSE BUT GOT

204
00:04:31,557 --> 00:04:33,992
TO KEEP YOU ALIVE.

205
00:04:33,992 --> 00:04:35,093
KNOW, WHATEVER THE NUMBER

206
00:04:35,093 --> 00:04:36,862
IS, YOU DON'T WANT ANYBODY

207
00:04:36,862 --> 00:04:37,996
TO LOSE THEIR LIFE.

208
00:04:37,996 --> 00:04:39,231
THAT'S WHY I HAVE TAKEN

209
00:04:39,231 --> 00:04:39,865
UTILITY COMPANIES OVER

210
00:04:39,865 --> 00:04:40,165

MAKE SURE THEY ARE PART OF

219
00:04:50,309 --> 00:04:51,376
OUR ECONOMY.

220
00:04:51,376 --> 00:04:52,778
WE ARE THE BEST MELTING POT

221
00:04:52,778 --> 00:00:00,000
IN THE WORLD.
