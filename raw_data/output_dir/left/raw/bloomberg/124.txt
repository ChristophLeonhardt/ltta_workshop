1
00:00:06,379 --> 00:00:10,470
Amputations can be the result of severe trauma,
or an aggressive disease.

2
00:00:10,470 --> 00:00:17,860
But the vast majority are caused by chronic
wounds, injuries that fail to heal.

3
00:00:17,860 --> 00:00:22,839
Many chronic wounds are linked to diabetes,
high blood sugar levels causes nerve damage

4
00:00:22,839 --> 00:00:27,179
and poor circulation making it harder for
wounds to heal.

5
00:00:27,179 --> 00:00:31,369
They can then become infected which sometimes
leads to amputation.

6
00:00:31,369 --> 00:00:35,440
Currently one in 11 Americans suffers from
diabetes.

7
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:39,590
By 2050, it could be one in four.

8
00:00:39,590 --> 00:00:42,930
Some wounds are treated with skin from pigs,
or human cadaver.

9
00:00:42,930 --> 00:00:47,540
However, both involve a high risk of failure
and disease transmission.

10
00:00:47,540 --> 00:00:51,350
It’s led to an unlikely discovery.

11
00:00:54,200 --> 00:01:00,180
I was interested in finding a source of material
that was as similar to human skin as possible.

12
00:01:00,180 --> 00:01:04,600
And the surprising thing is that cod fish
skin is much more similar to human skin

13
00:01:04,620 --> 00:01:07,480
than for example pig skin.

14
00:01:11,220 --> 00:01:16,420
A chemist by trade, Fertram
Sigurjonsson has spent his career treating

15
00:01:16,420 --> 00:01:17,450
chronic wounds

16
00:01:17,450 --> 00:01:23,670
Now, as CEO and founder of Kerecis he’s
turning cod skins into medical products in

17
00:01:23,670 --> 00:01:24,990
north west Iceland.

18
00:01:24,990 --> 00:01:30,990
Our facilities are located in the township
of Isafjordur, thirty miles from the Polar

19
00:01:30,990 --> 00:01:31,990
Circle.

20
00:01:31,990 --> 00:01:33,600
This is a fishing town.

21
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:41,040
Fish is caught and processed in a fish processing
plant and we collect the skins.

22
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:45,069
These are just landed this morning or last
night.

23
00:01:45,069 --> 00:01:46,060
They’re fresh.

24
00:01:46,060 --> 00:01:47,460
This one is rejected.

25
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:49,700
I’m examining for blood.

26
00:01:49,700 --> 00:01:52,600
A lot of time blood will bleed into the skin.

27
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:55,439
And looking for parasites, looking for holes.

28
00:01:55,440 --> 00:01:57,779
I don’t like that one either.

29
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:04,619
This one is looking pretty good, yeah this
is a nice beautiful one.

30
00:02:04,620 --> 00:02:07,840
Doesn’t have holes, blood spots, no tears.

31
00:02:11,450 --> 00:02:15,180
Once the best skins are picked, the Kerecis
team get to work on transforming them into

32
00:02:15,180 --> 00:02:17,500
medical grafts

33
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:20,570
The first step in our manufacturing is to
de-scale it.

34
00:02:20,570 --> 00:02:23,250
We want to remove the scales from the material.

35
00:02:23,250 --> 00:02:31,060
Then we put the skins into a solution that
cleans the skins and gently removes all cells.

36
00:02:31,060 --> 00:02:36,490
And then we move it into our clean room where
we remove all the liquid from the material

37
00:02:36,490 --> 00:02:42,250
gently while preserving the three dimensional
porous scaffolding structure of the materials,

38
00:02:42,250 --> 00:02:44,200
which is very important.

39
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:50,270
It’s too small for the human eye to see,
but this is what Kerecis says is vital to

40
00:02:50,270 --> 00:02:52,810
accelerating the healing process.

41
00:02:52,810 --> 00:02:58,050
The cell structure of the fish skin recruits
the body’s own cells to form healthy tissue.

42
00:02:58,050 --> 00:03:02,500
It’s then gradually incorporated into the
closing wound.

43
00:03:05,300 --> 00:03:10,340
Across the Ocean, in New York’s Mount Sinai
hospital Dr. John Lantis has been using Kerecis

44
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:12,440
products on his patients.

45
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:16,850
This is actually what the material looks like
a week after being put on.

46
00:03:16,850 --> 00:03:22,320
The outline of the fish skin is actually around
the outside here.

47
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:30,700
This is fish skin that is not active on him.

48
00:03:30,700 --> 00:03:35,750
The rest is fish skin deeper in the wound.

49
00:03:35,750 --> 00:03:36,750
So far so good.

50
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:42,160
It looks like it's coating the wound nicely
and filling in the way that it's supposed to

51
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:48,220
because prior to that it was hard for my
skin inside the wound to knit itself back together

52
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:52,300
Once Dr Lantis has cleaned out the wound he
applies a new Kerecis graft.

53
00:03:52,310 --> 00:03:55,810
It’s not known exactly why the fish skin
works.

54
00:03:55,810 --> 00:04:00,860
In a recent test conducted by Kerecis, the
company compared pig skin to fish skin.

55
00:04:00,860 --> 00:04:06,220
The Kerecis fish product closed the wound
significantly faster.

56
00:04:06,220 --> 00:04:14,780
The first three months of 2017 Kerecis sold
as much as they did in the the whole of 2016,

57
00:04:14,780 --> 00:04:19,100
and that growth isn’t just thanks to doctors
working with diabetic patients.

58
00:04:19,100 --> 00:04:21,709
Significant investment has come from the U.S.
military.

59
00:04:21,709 --> 00:04:27,130
It can be applied immediately to a burn wound,
just after extraction from the battlefield.

60
00:04:27,130 --> 00:04:28,750
Then it serves as a cover.

61
00:04:28,750 --> 00:04:35,460
It reduces pain and it's antimicrobial, so
it prevents infections.

62
00:04:41,430 --> 00:04:44,680
The fish in these waters have given a lot
to the people of Iceland.

63
00:04:44,690 --> 00:04:46,410
Sustenance and wealth.

64
00:04:46,410 --> 00:04:51,570
With Kerecis products costing up to a thousand
dollars, what was once a byproduct fed to

65
00:04:51,570 --> 00:00:00,000
farm animals, could now be the most valuable
part.
