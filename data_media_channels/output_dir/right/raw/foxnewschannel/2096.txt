SANDSER

5
00:00:13,979 --> 00:00:14,346
SANDSERS.

6
00:00:14,346 --> 00:00:18,984
THAT'S THE FOCUS OF TONIGHT'S

7
00:00:18,984 --> 00:00:19,284
ANGLE.

8
00:00:19,284 --> 00:00:21,453
YESTERDAY THE WHITE HOUSE PRESS

9
00:00:21,453 --> 00:00:24,089
BRIEFING TURNED INTO A TOTAL

10
00:00:24,089 --> 00:00:24,422
FRENZY.

11
00:00:24,422 --> 00:00:27,392
THE WHITE HOUSE PRESS CORPS IS

12
00:00:27,392 --> 00:00:31,096
UP IN ARMS OVER THE DISCREPANCY

13
00:00:31,096 --> 00:00:34,632
OF WHAT SHE TOLD THE PRESS

14
00:00:34,632 --> 00:00:37,035
PREVIOUSLY AND WHAT GIULIANI

15
00:00:37,035 --> 00:00:37,836

17
00:00:40,205 --> 00:00:42,407
YES OR NO WHETHER YOU WERE IN

18
00:00:42,407 --> 00:00:43,608
THE DARK?

19
00:00:43,608 --> 00:00:47,145
I THINK IT'S A FAIRLY SIMPLE

20
00:00:47,145 --> 00:00:47,512
QUESTION.

21
00:00:47,512 --> 00:00:49,147
>>  I THINK IT'S A FAIRLY SIMPLE

22
00:00:49,147 --> 00:00:49,514
ANSWER.

23
00:00:49,514 --> 00:00:51,950
I GAVE YOU THE BEST ANSWER I HAD

24
00:00:51,950 --> 00:00:54,552
AND I'LL CONTINUE TO DO THAT

25
00:00:54,552 --> 00:00:55,053
EVERY SINGLE DAY.

26
00:00:55,053 --> 00:00:57,856
>>  HAVE WE EVER GOTTEN ANY

27
00:00:57,856 --> 00:00:59,224
TRUTH OUT OF THEM?

28
00:00:59,224 --> 00:01:02,494
HAVE THEY BECOME TO THE POINT

29
00:01:02,494 --> 00:01:04,429
THAT THEY'VE BECOME NULL AND

30
00:01:04,429 --> 00:01:04,729
VOID?

31
00:01:04,729 --> 00:01:07,732
>>  BUT SHE'S LYING TO THE

32
00:01:07,732 --> 00:01:08,833
AMERICAN PUBLIC AND I THINK SHE

33
00:01:08,833 --> 00:01:10,568
NEEDS TO OWN THAT.

34
00:01:10,568 --> 00:01:12,337
BEING IGNORANT AND LYING ABOUT

35
00:01:12,337 --> 00:01:14,806
IT IS JUST NOT AN EXCUSE.

36
00:01:14,806 --> 00:01:17,108
>>  IS NO COMMENT A BETTER

37
00:01:17,108 --> 00:01:17,442
OPTION?

38
00:01:17,442 --> 00:01:19,377
>>  IF YOU'RE JUST GOING TO LIE,

39
00:01:19,377 --> 00:01:22,113
WHY BOTHER?

40
00:01:22,113 --> 00:01:23,114
>>  THIS IS HOW DEMOCRACY DIE

41
00:01:23,114 --> 00:01:25,383
SLOWLY RIGHT IN FRONT OF US.

42
00:01:25,383 --> 00:01:28,453
EVERY SINGLE DAY, DECEPTION AND

43
00:01:28,453 --> 00:01:31,156
LIES BECOME NORMAL.

44
00:01:31,156 --> 00:01:34,192
>>  HOW DRAMATIC, MIKE.

45
00:01:34,192 --> 00:01:35,894
"THIS IS HOW DEMOCRACY DIES."

46
00:01:35,894 --> 00:01:37,462
OH, PLEASE.

47
00:01:37,462 --> 00:01:40,098
THEN UNDER THE HEADLINE "WHY

48
00:01:40,098 --> 00:01:46,104
SARA SANDERS SHOULD QUIT."

49
00:01:46,104 --> 00:01:49,274
SHE LOST IT WITH THAT ANSWER.

50
00:01:49,274 --> 00:01:52,977
ADMITTING THAT YOU MISLED THE

51
00:01:52,977 --> 00:01:54,312
PRESS BECAUSE THE PRESIDENT

52
00:01:54,312 --> 00:01:56,214
MISLED YOU IS TANTAMOUNT TO

53
00:01:56,214 --> 00:01:57,949
TAKING YOUR CREDIBILITY, POURING

54
00:01:57,949 --> 00:01:59,818
GASOLINE ON IT, AND THEN SETTING

55
00:01:59,818 --> 00:02:01,286
IT ON FIRE.

56
00:02:01,286 --> 00:02:03,855
WELL, THESE PEOPLE ARE GOING TO

57
00:02:03,855 --> 00:02:06,291
LECTURE US ABOUT CREDIBILITY?

58
00:02:06,291 --> 00:02:07,459
THE PRESS?

59
00:02:07,459 --> 00:02:10,161
CONSIDER THE SOURCES.

60
00:02:10,161 --> 00:02:14,232
OR ACTUALLY, YEAH.

61
00:02:14,232 --> 00:02:15,867
ARE THESE RELIABLE SOURCES?

62
00:02:15,867 --> 00:02:19,003
FOR THE MOST PART, THE WHITE

63
00:02:19,003 --> 00:02:22,774
HOUSE PRESS POOL HAS BECOME A --

64
00:02:25,110 --> 00:02:26,678
JUST LISTEN TO THIS.

65
00:02:26,678 --> 00:02:28,947
>>  SHE CAN BE MAD AT WHAT I SAY

66
00:02:28,947 --> 00:02:29,848
RIGHT NOW.

67
00:02:29,848 --> 00:02:30,148
TOUGH.

68
00:02:30,148 --> 00:02:32,417
I'M A REPORTER WHO'S GOING TO

69
00:02:32,417 --> 00:02:34,119
CONTINUE TO ASK QUESTIONS AND

70
00:02:34,119 --> 00:02:34,853
THERE WAS NOTHING WRONG WITH

71
00:02:34,853 --> 00:02:36,287
THAT QUESTION.

72
00:02:36,287 --> 00:02:40,024
>>  I WISH I COULD INSTALL A BS

73
00:02:40,024 --> 00:02:42,494
METER.

74
00:02:42,494 --> 00:02:43,461
UNFORTUNATELY, I THINK IT WOULD

75
00:02:43,461 --> 00:02:45,830
BE GOING OFF ALL THE TIME.

76
00:02:45,830 --> 00:02:52,937
>>  I ACTUALLY REALLY LIKE SARA.

77
00:02:52,937 --> 00:02:55,206
I THINK SHE'S VERY RESOURCEFUL.

78
00:02:55,206 --> 00:02:58,877
SHE BURNS FACTS AND USES THAT

79
00:02:58,877 --> 00:03:00,578
ASH TO CREATE A SMOKY EYE.

80
00:03:00,578 --> 00:03:02,514
>>  THE EFFORT TO DEMEAN AND

81
00:03:02,514 --> 00:03:05,216
DRIVE OUT SANDERS AND SEND HER

82
00:03:05,216 --> 00:03:07,619
PACKING FROM HER JOB IS PART OF

83
00:03:07,619 --> 00:03:08,953
THE POLITICS OF PERSONAL

84
00:03:08,953 --> 00:03:10,555
DESTRUCTION IN THIS TOWN,

85
00:03:10,555 --> 00:03:11,055
WASHINGTON, D.C.

86
00:03:11,055 --> 00:03:12,056
ANYONE WHO WORKS FOR THE

87
00:03:12,056 --> 00:03:13,892
PRESIDENT IS A TARGET BECAUSE

88
00:03:13,892 --> 00:03:16,728
THE RESISTANCE WANTS TO THIN THE

89
00:03:16,728 --> 00:03:20,098
RANKS OF THOSE IN THE

90
00:03:20,098 --> 00:03:22,333
ADMINISTRATION AND ADVANCE A

91
00:03:22,333 --> 00:03:24,035
NARRATIVE OF INTERNAL DIVISION

92
00:03:24,035 --> 00:03:24,936
AND CHAOS.

93
00:03:24,936 --> 00:03:27,238
AND AT THE SAME TIME, SARAH

94
00:03:27,238 --> 00:03:28,640
SANDERS IS IN A VERY DIFFICULT

95
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:31,376
POSITION AND HAS TO LOOK OUT FOR

96
00:03:31,376 --> 00:03:34,979
HER OWN CREDIBILITY AS WELL.

97
00:03:34,979 --> 00:03:37,415
SHE WAS GIVEN SCANT INFORMATION

98
00:03:37,415 --> 00:03:40,318
AND REPEATED WHAT SHE WAS TOLD

99
00:03:40,318 --> 00:03:41,486
IN GOOD FAITH.

100
00:03:41,486 --> 00:03:42,954
ALL QUESTIONS ABOUT THIS

101
00:03:42,954 --> 00:03:43,855
INFORMATION SHOULD HAVE BEEN

102
00:03:43,855 --> 00:03:45,557
REFERRED TO THE PRESIDENT'S

103
00:03:45,557 --> 00:03:47,859
LEGAL TEAM, PERIOD.

104
00:03:47,859 --> 00:03:49,093
TRUMP NEEDS A LEGAL

105
00:03:49,093 --> 00:00:00,000
SPOKESPERSON, WHICH HE DOESN'T
