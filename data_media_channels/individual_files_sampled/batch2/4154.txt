all right I am literally just being handed this piece of paper so bear with me folks this is from Jim Ruttenberg in the New York Times a former Playboy model who claims she had an affair with Donald Trump sued on Tuesday to be released from a 2016 legal agreement requiring her silence becoming the second woman obviously after stormy Daniels to challenge Trump allies efforts during the presidential campaign this is Karen McDougal suing the company that owns the National Enquirer which paid her a hundred and fifty thousand dollars and whose chief executive is a friend of mr. Trump's and of course the other person is stormy Daniels let me get your reaction yes this is significant breaking news this is another woman whose account I believe was originally reported by Ronan Farrow in The New Yorker but this goes to what mr. robin adi and other people of saying this breaking news is the suggestion here that the reason that the Trump Whitehouse and the Trump Organization which is involved in all this has gone to such great lengths to silence miss Daniels is that maybe there are other people well now we're seeing one with another alleged NDA and obviously this news is just coming in to our newsroom courtesy the New York Times as you say Chris but what this suggests is is it explains why as I was mentioning moments ago we saw such an unusual Friday night filing from the White House basically in the in the Vistage of Donald Trump personally entering the litigation which is not something you do lightly but does suggest they want to stop this and so the question that that emerges is how many other people how many other women may be out there with NDA's trying to decide is it in their interest to stay quiet or if these things are gonna break and they have something they want to say can they do that without being exposed to millions of dollars in fees or bankruptcy so what again the New York Times is reporting katie is that miss mcdougal who filed this in Los Angeles Superior Court claims that the president's personal lawyer Michael Cohen was secretly involved in her talks with the company that owns the National Enquirer the American media Inc am i and that the company and her lawyer at the time misled her about the deal so her new lawyer a guy named Peter stris sent an email to the New York Times accusing AMI of quote a multi-faceted effort to silence Karen McDougal your reaction to that so what's fascinating about those allegations and our ease right these are always just allegations until they're proven in court is what you said it's Michael Cohen why is Michael Cohen's imprimatur why is it stop prints on everything and so what ends up happening is if you want to have a binding contract Chris you have to look at the intent of the parties and if you look at the intent of the parties you can look at things like emails correspondence letters in order to prove the intent of the parties to enter into a binding contract that contract would be that non-disclosure agreement that Karen McDougal is challenging right now and the fact that she's bringing a lawsuit means she wants the opportunity to be able to have that discovery process occur so that things like interrogatories things like depositions things that could help provide the information that she can use to prove exactly what she's a legend Gator complaint can be provided but I'll bet you that there's an NDA I bet you there's an arbitration provision there well bitch we're gonna hear that argument and the other piece here I'm doing a little live legal analysis so it's just what I've been handed but in many ways the legal odds for this brand new lawsuit breaking right now for mr. MacDougal are probably better than miss Daniels and I'll explain why miss Daniels did originally contract for silence and that is something you can contract to talk you can contract not to talk the allegation here is fundamentally different we have to see how it plays out but it's something that had been previously reported that she didn't contract for silence that she contracted to tell her story through a publication The Inquirer which is famously controlled by a close friend of Donald Trump's and that's public they don't deny that and so here the allegation could be very different it essentially is that she thought she was making a contract to release this story about mr. Trump quote I'm reading here on her own terms her suit says and then they flipped it on her and silenced her by saying we're not gonna print it but you keep the money and you don't get to tell your story here or anywhere else that I can tell you legally as a stronger claim if you can argue that if said why is that not legal they paid her first story they decided not to use it is that any different for example and I certainly know people who this has happened to somebody options your book they pay you for it because they think they're gonna make a movie about it and they never do it's a great question and and now we're gonna get into we're gonna move from Playboy models and adult film actresses to a little copyright law if everyone wants to just come along for the ride the main difference would be are you holding the copyright of the underlying material okay the idea for the movie or the words you wrote for a given article you take the kill fee they own that copyright or have you now perhaps without your knowledge that's what this seems to allege been told you can't speak about something that happened in your life ever again in other words the Enquirer might have a good legal grounds to say we own those particular words but not all words you might ever state about this thing so you could imagine someone could sell an idea for a movie because they live through a plane crash and the plot of that movie they no longer own but they can talk and so this is a very interesting suit hey there I'm Chris Hayes from MSNBC thanks for watching MSNBC on youtube if you want to keep up to date with the videos we're putting out you can click subscribe just below me or click over on this list to see lots of other great videos
