HEATHER: YES, EXACTLY. THANK YOU SO MUCH. RAN KANYE WEST IS HEADED TO THE WHITE HOUSE FOR A MEETING WITH THE PRESIDENT. ON THE DOCKET, VIOLENCE IN CHICAGO. WHAT IMPACT WILL THEIR TALK HAVE? JOINING ME NOW WITH INSIGHT IS FOX NEWS POLITICAL AN LISS JAY A FOX NEWS POLITICAL AN LISS JAY Y FOX NEWS POLITICAL AN LISS JAY T FOX NEWS POLITICAL AN LISS JAY J FOX NEWS POLITICAL AN LISS JAY A FOX NEWS POLITICAL AN LISS JAY Y ANNA CALDWELL. WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT THE MEETING BETWEEN KANYE AND THE PRESIDENT? DO YOU THINK ANYTHING WILL COME FROM IT? I THINK THIS IS AN EXCITING TIME WHEN IT COMES TO ADDRESSING THE VIOLENCE IN CHICAGO. CANDIDATE TRUMP OFTEN DISCUSSED WHAT WAS GOING ON IN CHICAGO. I KNOW TO MANY ON THE LEFT AND MAY SAYERS IN THE MEDIA SAID THAT ISN'T TRUE. WHAT WE SEE IS A SYSTEMIC VIOLENCE THAT OCCURRED IN CHICAGO. WE'VE GOT ALMOST 24 SHOOTINGS THAT OCCURRED THIS YEAR AND THE MOST DEADLY WEEKEND IN CHICAGO'S HISTORY OCCURRED THIS YEAR. WHEN IT COMES TO THE TOPICS IN WHICH THEY'LL DISCUSS, THAT WILL BE ONE OF THE THINGS, POLICE REFORM NOT POLICE REFORM BUT PRISON REFORM WILL BE ANOTHER. JARED KUSHNER WILL BE IN THE ROOM. THESE ARE ISSUES THAT THE ADMINISTRATION DOES CARE ABOUT AND THEY WANT TO SEE SOLUTIONS COME TO THE TABLE. HEATHER: JUST TO REMIND PEOPLE AT HOME, WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT VIOLENCE IN CHICAGO, YOU KNOW FIRSTHAND. YOU'RE NOT JUST TALKING ABOUT STATS AND POLL NUMBERS AND THAT TYPE OF THING. YOUR YOUNGER BROTHER, LUCKY TO BE ALIVE AS A RESULT OF SOME OF THAT. YES. HEATHER: CAN YOU PEOPLE HEATHER: CAN YOU TEOPLE HEATHER: CAN YOU TELPLE HEATHER: CAN YOU TELLLE HEATHER: CAN YOU TELL PEOPLE A LITTLE MORE. LAST YEAR MY BROTHER WAS IN A CAR WITH A COUPLE FRIENDS WHEN TWO MEN WALKED UP AND SHOT THE CAR 25 TIMES. THANKFULLY, HE LIVED. HIS BEST FRIEND DIED IN HIS ARMS. THAT'S WHY THIS ISSUE IS SO IMPORTANT TO ME AND I'M THANKFUL TO THE FOX NEWS FAMILY WHICH ALLOWED ME TO HIGHLIGHT THIS ISSUE AND GO TO CHICAGO AND INTERVIEW GANG MEMBERS AND TALK ABOUT THESE ISSUES. THIS IS WHY THIS IS SUCH AN IMPORTANT ISSUE. I KNOW PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS RECENTLY DISCUSSED WHAT'S GOING ON IN THE CITY OF CHICAGO, LIKE CRISIS INTERVENTION, USE OF FORCE TO NAME A FEW THINGS. HEATHER: WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT STOP AND? FRISK? HE WAS TALKING ABOUT THAT ON MONDAY. THE STOP AND FRISK ISSUE IS SOMETHING THAT'S RULED AS UNCONSTITUTIONAL. WITH PRESIDENT TRUMP AND JEFF SESSIONS GOING IN AND POTENTIALLY UPROOTING THE CONSENT DECREE, I THINK IT COULD BE MA PARTICULAR. PROBLEMATIC. THE REASON FOR CONSENT DECREES IS TO IS WHEN THERE'S CONSIDERATION OF POLICE MISCONDUCT AND CORRUPTION. YOU THINK ABOUT CASES LIKE JOHN BURGE WHO TORTURED OVER 200 SUSPECTS, HIM AND HIS TEAM, COST THE CITY OF CHICAGO OVER $100 MILLION. YOU THINK ABOUT THE LAQUAN McDONALD SHOOTING. YOU THINK ABOUT A FORMER POLICE OFFICER WHO WAS ACCUSED OF FRAMING OVER 51 PEOPLE OF MURDER AND THIS WAS FOLKS THAT WERE CONVICTED FOR UP TO 2300 YEARS, COMBINED. SO WE HAVE TO APPROACH THIS IN A VERY STRATEGIC WAY BECAUSE IT ISN'T JUST A SHOOTING IN CHICAGO THAT WE SHOULD BE CONCERNED ABOUT. WE SHOULD BE CONCERNED ABOUT THE FULL PICTURE. WE WANT THE ENTIRE CITY HEATHER: WE'RE RUNNING OUT OF TIME. THAT'S PART OF WHAT KANYE IS HOPING TO ACCOMPLISH. QUICKLY, THE BACKLASH THAT HE RECEIVED, IT REALLY HAS BEEN DISTURBING WHEN YOU LISTEN TO SOME LEADERS FROM THE BLACK COMMUNITY SAYING HE'S CRAZY, HE'S GONE TO THE HOSPITAL, HE SHOULDN'T LISTEN TO HIM, ALL THAT TYPE OF THING. I AM COMPLETELY DISTURBED THAT THEY WOULD GO AFTER KANYE IN A WAY THAT HAD IN A WAY THET HAD IN A WAY THEY HAD IN A WAY THEY HAVE. IF OWE WERE IF HWE WERE IF HEE WERE IF HE WWERE IF HE WERRE IF HE WEREE IF HE WERE INSUPPORT OF HILLARYC IF HE WERE INSUPPORT OF HILLARYI IF HE WERE INSUPPORT OF HILLARYT IF HE WERE INSUPPORT OF HILLARYN IF HE WERE INSUPPORT OF HILLARY, IF HE WERE INSUPPORT OF HILLARYY IF HE WERE INSUPPORT OF HILLARYU WOULDN'T SEE THE BACKLASH. YOU WOULDN'T SEE THIS FROM THE LIBERAL ELITE. TO CONSIDER A MAN LIKE THIS WHO HAS BEEN QUITE FRANKLY A GENIUS IN HIS CREATION OF MUSIC, WENT FROM PRODUCING TO RAPPING TO NOW BEING A FASHION MOGUL, HOW COULD YOU CALL THIS GUY DUMB OR STUPID AS WE SEE SOME OF MY FRIENDS ON THE OTHER SIDE, OTHER NETWORK HAVE SAID ABOUT HIM. I'M COMPLETELY DISTURBED THAT THEY WOULD GO AFTER SOMEONE LIKE THIS. I KNOW BLACK CONSERVATIVES ALL OVER THE COUNTRY FEEL HIS PAIN BECAUSE WE WHO GO ON NATIONAL PLATFORMS ARE REGULARLY CALLED THOSE THINGS BY THE LIBERAL LEFT. HEATHER: THANK YOU SO MUCH. I REALLY APPRECIATE YOU JOINING US. I HOPE HE ACCOMPLISHES A LOT. I HOPE THE MEETING BETWEEN
