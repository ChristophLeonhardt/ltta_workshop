1
00:00:03,379 --> 00:00:03,778
INVOLVEMENT.

2
00:00:03,779 --> 00:00:05,313
>> THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

3
00:00:05,314 --> 00:00:07,015
MY NEXT GUEST IS A LONG TIME

4
00:00:07,016 --> 00:00:09,284
ACQUAINTANCE OF THE MISSING

5
00:00:09,285 --> 00:00:12,387
JOURNALIST.

6
00:00:12,388 --> 00:00:13,988
JUDITH, YOU WROTE ABOUT THE

7
00:00:13,989 --> 00:00:15,990
STORY OVER THE WEEKEND, AND YOU

8
00:00:15,991 --> 00:00:17,392
WERE CONVINCED OF THAN THAT HE

9
00:00:17,393 --> 00:00:20,595
HAD BEEN MURDERED, AND THAT IT

10
00:00:20,596 --> 00:00:21,996
HAD BEEN DONE BY SAUDIS?

11
00:00:21,997 --> 00:00:22,797
>> RIGHT.

12
00:00:22,798 --> 00:00:24,132
I THINK IT WAS OBVIOUS TO THOSE

13
00:00:24,133 --> 00:00:26,234
OF US WHO HAVE BEEN IN THE

14
00:00:26,235 --> 00:00:26,934
MIDDLE EAST, WHO HAVE WATCHED

15
00:00:26,935 --> 00:00:29,237
THE MIDDLE EAST FOR A LONG TIME

16
00:00:29,238 --> 00:00:30,838
AND HAVE BEEN WATCHING

17
00:00:30,839 --> 00:00:32,006
SAUDI ARABIA, THAT WHEN A MAN

18
00:00:32,006 --> 00:00:34,642
SAYS TO HIS FIANCEE, HERE'S MY

19
00:00:34,643 --> 00:00:36,644
CELL PHONE, I'M GOING INTO AN

20
00:00:36,645 --> 00:00:39,047
EMBASSY, I CONSULATE THAT MAY BE

21
00:00:39,048 --> 00:00:39,580
PROBLEMATIC FOR ME.

22
00:00:39,581 --> 00:00:57,665
IF I DON'T COME OUT, CALL THE

23
00:00:57,666 --> 00:00:58,366
PRESIDENT OF TURKEY'S OFFICE,

24
00:00:58,367 --> 00:00:59,000
BECAUSE SOMETHING BAD HAD

25
00:00:59,001 --> 00:00:59,367
HAPPENED.

26
00:00:59,368 --> 00:01:00,034
I HAD A VERY BAD FEELING AND

27
00:01:00,035 --> 00:01:00,635
FIGURED THAT'S WHAT HAD

28
00:01:00,636 --> 00:01:01,002
HAPPENED.

29
00:01:01,003 --> 00:01:01,703
>> Martha: SO THE CROWN PRINCE

30
00:01:01,704 --> 00:01:02,303
OF SAUDI ARABIA HAS BEEN

31
00:01:02,304 --> 00:01:03,037
BRIDGING THESE RELATIONSHIPS AND

32
00:01:03,038 --> 00:01:03,705
SAYING HE HAS A REFORMIST OF

33
00:01:03,706 --> 00:01:04,439
SAUDI ARABIA AND HE HAS ALLOWED

34
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:05,773
WOMEN TO DRIVE.

35
00:01:05,774 --> 00:01:06,407
PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS BEEN

36
00:01:06,408 --> 00:01:07,108
HERALDING HOW WONDERFUL IT IS

37
00:01:07,109 --> 00:01:14,382
THAT WE ARE'S BUILDING A NICE

38
00:01:14,383 --> 00:01:15,183
RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN ISRAEL AND

39
00:01:15,184 --> 00:01:15,616
SAUDI ARABIA.

40
00:01:15,617 --> 00:01:18,252
HE PUTS ALL THIS AT RISK FOR

41
00:01:18,253 --> 00:01:18,786
THIS JOURNALIST?

42
00:01:18,787 --> 00:01:19,987
>> I DON'T THINK HE WOULD HAVE

43
00:01:19,988 --> 00:01:21,522
DONE THIS UNLESS HE HAD REASON

44
00:01:21,523 --> 00:01:22,590
TO BELIEVE THAT NOTHING TERRIBLE

45
00:01:22,591 --> 00:01:24,425
WAS GOING TO HAPPEN TO HIM, AND

46
00:01:24,426 --> 00:01:25,460
THERE WERE LOTS OF INDICATIONS

47
00:01:25,461 --> 00:01:26,594
THAT THAT WAS TRUE.

48
00:01:26,595 --> 00:01:31,966
IN FACT, PRESIDENT TRUMP TODAY

49
00:01:31,967 --> 00:01:34,168
CALLED THE U.S. AND SAUDI

50
00:01:34,169 --> 00:01:36,371
RELATIONS EXCELLENT AND IT'S

51
00:01:36,372 --> 00:01:37,338
CLEAR THAT PRESIDENT TRUMP ALSO

52
00:01:37,339 --> 00:01:41,209
SAID THAT HE WANTED TO CONTINUE

53
00:01:41,210 --> 00:01:43,044
SELLING WEAPONS TO SAUDI ARABIA.

54
00:01:43,045 --> 00:01:46,981
BY THE WAY, THE PRESIDENT SAID,

55
00:01:46,982 --> 00:01:48,383
SAUDI ARABIA WAS HIS FIRST

56
00:01:48,384 --> 00:01:50,318
FOREIGN TRIP.

57
00:01:50,319 --> 00:01:57,191
HE SAID THAT HE AND IT DEALS TO

58
00:01:57,192 --> 00:01:57,992
BUY $110 BILLION WORTH OF

59
00:01:57,993 --> 00:01:59,394
WEAPONS BUT THE BOOKING

60
00:01:59,395 --> 00:02:00,595
INSTITUTIONS POINT OUT THAT

61
00:02:00,596 --> 00:02:03,398
THERE HAD BEEN ZERO BIG

62
00:02:03,399 --> 00:02:04,599
PURCHASES, SAUDI PURCHASES SO

63
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:05,032
FAR.

64
00:02:05,033 --> 00:02:07,068
SO THIS IS REALLY AN EXCUSE.

65
00:02:07,069 --> 00:02:08,469
I THINK WHAT PRESIDENT TRUMP AND

66
00:02:08,470 --> 00:02:12,440
THE CROWN PRINCE HEAVEN, AND HIS

67
00:02:12,441 --> 00:02:14,375
HATRED OF IRAN AND A DESIRE TO

68
00:02:14,376 --> 00:02:19,180
KEEP OIL PRICES VERY LOW.

69
00:02:19,181 --> 00:02:21,082
GOOD SAUDI U.S. RELATIONS, THEY

70
00:02:21,083 --> 00:02:23,751
ARE LONG-STANDING.

71
00:02:23,752 --> 00:02:24,585
EVERY AMERICAN PRESIDENT WANTS

72
00:02:24,586 --> 00:02:26,020
GOOD RELATIONS BUT THIS TIME

73
00:02:26,021 --> 00:02:28,022
THIS BRASH YOUNG LEADER WHO HAS

74
00:02:28,023 --> 00:02:30,191
MADE MANY MISTAKES IN FOREIGN

75
00:02:30,192 --> 00:02:31,826
POLICY HAS JUST GONE TOO FAR.

76
00:02:31,827 --> 00:02:34,128
>> AND WE REMEMBER WHEN HE

77
00:02:34,129 --> 00:02:35,396
LOCKED UP A LOT OF THE TOP

78
00:02:35,397 --> 00:02:37,031
FAMILY MEMBERS AND OFFICIALS AT

79
00:02:37,032 --> 00:02:39,400
THE RITZ-CARLTON, I BELIEVE IT

80
00:02:39,401 --> 00:02:42,203
WAS, AND HELD THEM, AND THEN

81
00:02:42,204 --> 00:02:42,904
ESCORTED THEM ESSENTIALLY TO

82
00:02:42,905 --> 00:02:45,773
BASICALLY PAY THEIR WAY OUT OF

83
00:02:45,774 --> 00:02:47,008
OF AIR.

84
00:02:47,009 --> 00:02:48,276
BUT HE SAID HE WAS CLEANING OUT

85
00:02:48,277 --> 00:02:50,178
THE GOVERNMENT, GETTING RID OF

86
00:02:50,179 --> 00:02:52,079
PEOPLE WHO WERE CORRUPT IN THAT

87
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:54,248
LEADERSHIP.

88
00:02:54,249 --> 00:02:56,384
>> A LOT OF MY COLLEAGUES IN THE

89
00:02:56,385 --> 00:02:59,187
PRESS WERE SAYING, ISN'T THIS

90
00:02:59,188 --> 00:02:59,787
WONDERFUL?

91
00:02:59,788 --> 00:03:02,457
HE'S TAKING DOWN THE ELITE, HE'S

92
00:03:02,458 --> 00:03:05,593
TAKING ILL-GOTTEN GAINS FROM

93
00:03:05,594 --> 00:03:07,061
WEALTHY SAUDIS, AND HE LOCKED TO

94
00:03:07,062 --> 00:03:09,797
THESE PEOPLE UP IN A FIVE-STAR

95
00:03:09,798 --> 00:03:11,933
PRISON WITHOUT FORMAL CHARGES,

96
00:03:11,934 --> 00:03:14,235
WITHOUT ANY JUDGE LOOKING AT

97
00:03:14,236 --> 00:03:14,769
ANYTHING.

98
00:03:14,770 --> 00:03:20,808
THIS WAS NOT THE SIGN OF US IN A

99
00:03:20,809 --> 00:03:21,809
THIS WAS NOT THE SIGN OF US IN N

100
00:03:21,810 --> 00:03:22,310
ISLAMIC REFORMER.

101
00:03:22,311 --> 00:03:24,879
THIS WAS NOT THE MAN WHO

102
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:26,314
BELIEVED SAUDI ARABIA NEED

103
00:03:26,315 --> 00:03:28,182
SECULARIZATION AND RULE OF LAW.

104
00:03:28,183 --> 00:03:29,484
>> THE BOB CORKER AND

105
00:03:29,485 --> 00:03:30,585
SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM WAS ON

106
00:03:30,586 --> 00:03:33,221
THE SHOW LAST NIGHT AND SAYING,

107
00:03:33,222 --> 00:03:33,754
THEY MEAN BUSINESS.

108
00:03:33,755 --> 00:03:39,794
DO THEY THINK -- I REALLY

109
00:03:39,795 --> 00:03:41,796
THINK -- THERE WAS AN

110
00:03:41,797 --> 00:03:42,396
ANNOUNCEMENT TODAY THAT

111
00:03:42,397 --> 00:03:43,898
SAUDI ARABIA AND TURKEY WERE

112
00:03:43,899 --> 00:03:47,201
GOING TO WORK TOGETHER.

113
00:03:47,202 --> 00:03:49,237
IT'S A JOINT INVESTIGATION AND

114
00:03:49,238 --> 00:03:51,205
THAT'S LIKE FOX'S GUARD THE HEN

115
00:03:51,206 --> 00:03:52,273
HOUSE IF THE UNITED STATES JOINS

116
00:03:52,274 --> 00:03:54,008
SUCH AN INVESTIGATION.

117
00:03:54,009 --> 00:03:55,643
IT'S LIKELY TO BE A WHITEWASH.

118
00:03:55,644 --> 00:03:59,680
I THINK WE PRETTY MUCH KNOW WHAT

119
00:03:59,681 --> 00:04:01,382
HAPPENS, AND I DON'T THINK THAT

120
00:04:01,383 --> 00:04:02,583
SAUDI ARABIA IN THE END WILL PAY

121
00:04:02,584 --> 00:04:05,386
MUCH OF A PRICE FOR THIS.

122
00:04:05,387 --> 00:04:06,787
THE CARAVAN WILL MOVE ON.

123
00:04:06,788 --> 00:04:09,190
AS WE SAY IN THE MIDDLE EAST,

124
00:04:09,191 --> 00:04:10,558
THE TENSION WILL BE DISTRACTED

125
00:04:10,559 --> 00:04:13,394
BY KANYE, BY THE HURRICANES,

126
00:04:13,395 --> 00:04:13,828
WHATEVER.

127
00:04:13,829 --> 00:04:15,763
DONALD TRUMP THINKS THAT WE NEED

128
00:04:15,764 --> 00:04:16,597
TO SAUDI ARABIA, AND I WILL

129
00:04:16,598 --> 00:04:19,100
LAUGH, I'M NOT SURE THAT THERE

130
00:04:19,101 --> 00:00:00,000
WILL EVER BE JUSTICE FOR JAMAAL.
