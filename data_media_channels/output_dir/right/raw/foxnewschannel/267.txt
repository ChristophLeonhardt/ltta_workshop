>> GOOD MORNING TO YOU.

4
00:00:07,117 --> 00:00:08,684
THE PRESIDENT LOOKS LIKE HE IS

5
00:00:08,685 --> 00:00:13,089
GOING TO BE GOING TO FLORIDA,

6
00:00:13,090 --> 00:00:13,589
GEORGIA ON MONDAY.

7
00:00:13,590 --> 00:00:18,094
DEPENDING ON HOW THE RECOVERY

8
00:00:18,095 --> 00:00:18,694
EFFORTS GO.

9
00:00:18,695 --> 00:00:20,096
THE PRESIDENT THIS MORNING

10
00:00:20,097 --> 00:00:21,097
PROMISING THAT THE FEDERAL

00:00:21,098 --> 00:00:22,932
GOVERNMENT IS IN POSITION AND IS

12
00:00:22,933 --> 00:00:24,934
READY TO RESPOND VERY QUICKLY.

13
00:00:24,935 --> 00:00:25,334
LISTEN HERE.

14
00:00:25,335 --> 00:00:27,303
>> WELL, IT IS GOING TO GO FAST.

15
00:00:27,304 --> 00:00:30,306
WE ARE GOING TO MAKE IT GO FAST.

16
00:00:30,307 --> 00:00:32,475
WE ARE FOLLOWING AN END.

17
00:00:32,476 --> 00:00:34,076
IT IS JUST ABOUT GONE FROM

18
00:00:34,077 --> 00:00:34,710
CERTAIN AREAS.

19
00:00:34,711 --> 00:00:36,746
ONE THING WE HAD TO OUR

20
00:00:36,747 --> 00:00:38,314
ADVANTAGE WAS THE SPEED.

21
00:00:38,315 --> 00:00:40,082
THIS THING WAS IN AND OUT, BUT

22
00:00:40,083 --> 00:00:42,184
WE HAVE NEVER SEEN POWER LIKE

23
00:00:42,185 --> 00:00:42,919
THAT.

24
00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:44,220
>> THE PRESIDENT TAKING SOME

25
00:00:44,221 --> 00:00:45,688
HEAT FOR GOING TO A POLITICAL

26
00:00:45,689 --> 00:00:47,890
RALLY LAST NIGHT EVEN AS THE

27
00:00:47,891 --> 00:00:49,091
HURRICANE WAS STILL RAGING.

28
00:00:49,092 --> 00:00:51,627
THE PRESIDENT SAID HE DID NOT

29
00:00:51,628 --> 00:00:54,931
WANT TO DISAPPOINT PEOPLE WHO

30
00:00:54,932 --> 00:00:56,699
HAD BEEN LINING UP ALL DAY.

31
00:00:56,700 --> 00:00:58,034
THE DEMOCRATS MAKING A LOT OF

32
00:00:58,035 --> 00:00:58,968
POLITICAL HAY ABOUT IT.

33
00:00:58,969 --> 00:01:00,970

34
00:01:00,971 --> 00:01:02,805

36
00:01:03,807 --> 00:01:04,907
MUSICAL ICONS OF THE WHITE HOUSE

WERE NOW FOR DECIDING THE

38
00:01:09,146 --> 00:01:10,046
MUSICAL MODERNIZATION ACT.

39
00:01:10,047 --> 00:01:12,915
THEN AFTER THAT, WHAT

40
00:01:12,916 --> 00:01:13,683
EVERYBODY'S TALKING ABOUT.

41
00:01:13,684 --> 00:01:15,484
THE PRESIDENT IS GOING TO BE

42
00:01:15,485 --> 00:01:17,286
HAVING LUNCH WITH CONNIE WEST.

43
00:01:17,287 --> 00:01:17,954
LISTEN TO WHAT THE PRESIDENT

44
00:01:17,955 --> 00:01:21,190
SAID A LITTLE WHILE AGO ABOUT

45
00:01:21,191 --> 00:01:21,490
THAT.

46
00:01:21,491 --> 00:01:23,960
>> FIRST OF ALL, I LIKE HIM A

47
00:01:23,961 --> 00:01:24,493
LOT.

48
00:01:24,494 --> 00:01:25,561
I HAVE KNOWN HIM FOR A LONG

49
00:01:25,562 --> 00:01:26,295
TIME.

50
00:01:26,296 --> 00:01:27,463
HE IS A VERY DIFFERENT KIND OF

51
00:01:27,464 --> 00:01:28,197
GUY.

52
00:01:28,198 --> 00:01:31,067
HE IS A DIFFERENT KIND OF A GUY.

53
00:01:31,068 --> 00:01:33,169
WHEN HE CAME OUT VERY STRONGLY A

54
00:01:33,170 --> 00:01:35,638
NUMBER OF MONTHS AGO, SOMETHING

55
00:01:35,639 --> 00:01:37,073
HAPPENED.

56
00:01:37,074 --> 00:01:39,275
MY POLLS WENT UP LIKE 20%.

57
00:01:39,276 --> 00:01:41,077
NO ONE HAS EVER SEEN THAT.

58
00:01:41,078 --> 00:01:43,312
HE HAS GOT A BIG FOLLOWING IN

59
00:01:43,313 --> 00:01:44,880
THE AFRICAN-AMERICAN COMMUNITY.

60
00:01:44,881 --> 00:01:46,482
A BIG, BIG FOLLOWING.

61
00:01:46,483 --> 00:01:48,951
AND I THINK HE DOES IN A LOT OF

62
00:01:48,952 --> 00:01:49,919
COMMUNITIES.

63
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:51,721
>> Jon: ALL OF THE

64
00:01:51,722 --> 00:01:52,922
PHOTOGRAPHERS AND CAMERAS LINED

65
00:01:52,923 --> 00:01:55,491
UP, HOPING TO CATCH A GLIMPSE OF

66
00:01:55,492 --> 00:01:55,791
KANYE.

67
00:01:55,792 --> 00:01:56,826
ALSO WEIGHING IN ON THE STOCK

68
00:01:56,827 --> 00:02:00,096
MARKET YESTERDAY.

69
00:02:00,097 --> 00:02:01,530
THE PRESIDENT, THE WHITE HOUSE

70
00:02:01,531 --> 00:02:03,666
TALKING ABOUT WHAT THEY BELIEVE

71
00:02:03,667 --> 00:02:04,867
IS BULL MARKET CORRECTIONS GOING

72
00:02:04,868 --> 00:02:05,668
ON HERE.

73
00:02:05,669 --> 00:02:06,769
A LITTLE BIT OF VOLATILITY.

74
00:02:06,770 --> 00:02:08,971
THE PRESIDENT DOES SAY THAT

75
00:02:08,972 --> 00:02:12,408
INVESTORS ARE CONCERNED ABOUT

76
00:02:12,409 --> 00:02:13,075
WHAT THE FEDERAL RESERVE IS

77
00:02:13,076 --> 00:02:14,176
DOING AS FAR AS INTEREST RATE

78
00:02:14,177 --> 00:02:14,910
HIKES GO.

79
00:02:14,911 --> 00:02:16,645
THERE HAVE BEEN THROUGH SO FAR

80
00:02:16,646 --> 00:02:17,113
THIS YEAR.

81
00:02:17,114 --> 00:02:17,880
ANOTHER ONE EXPECTED BEFORE THE

82
00:02:17,881 --> 00:02:20,082
END OF THE YEAR.

83
00:02:20,083 --> 00:02:20,983
THE PRESIDENT WITH SOME HARSH

84
00:02:20,984 --> 00:02:22,785
WORDS YESTERDAY IN PENNSYLVANIA

85
00:02:22,786 --> 00:02:25,554
FOR THE FED.

86
00:02:25,555 --> 00:02:30,059
>> I THINK THE FED IS MAKING A

87
00:02:30,060 --> 00:02:30,926
MISTAKE.

88
00:02:30,927 --> 00:02:32,461
THEY ARE SO TIGHT.

89
00:02:32,462 --> 00:02:33,863
I THINK THE FED HAS GONE CRAZY.

90
00:02:33,864 --> 00:02:37,066
SO YOU COULD SAY THAT THAT'S A

91
00:02:37,067 --> 00:02:37,867
LOT OF SAFETY, ACTUALLY.

92
00:02:37,868 --> 00:02:39,335
AND IT IS.

93
00:02:39,336 --> 00:02:41,270
IT GIVES YOU A LOT OF MARGINS,

94
00:02:41,271 --> 00:02:43,272
BUT I THINK THE FED HAS GONE

95
00:02:43,273 --> 00:02:43,572
CRAZY.

96
00:02:43,573 --> 00:02:46,142
>> Jon: THE PRESIDENT DOES

97
00:02:46,143 --> 00:02:47,076
BELIEVE IN AN INDEPENDENT

98
00:02:47,077 --> 00:02:48,344
FEDERAL RESERVE, BUT TO MY

99
00:02:48,345 --> 00:02:49,045
KNOWLEDGE, THAT IS THE FIRST

100
00:02:49,046 --> 00:02:51,680
TIME A SITTING PRESIDENT OF THE

101
00:02:51,681 --> 00:02:53,883
UNITED STATES HAS EVER SAID THE

102
00:02:53,884 --> 00:02:57,720
WORDS "THE FED HAS GONE CRAZY."

103
00:02:57,721 --> 00:02:58,621
>> Sandra: THEY HAVE RAISED

104
00:02:58,622 --> 00:03:00,489
INTEREST RATES THREE TIMES THIS

105
00:03:00,490 --> 00:03:01,090
YEAR.

106
00:03:01,091 --> 00:03:02,024
EXPECTED TO HIKE ONCE MORE BY

107
00:03:02,025 --> 00:03:03,492
THE END OF THE YEAR.

108
00:03:03,493 --> 00:00:00,000
