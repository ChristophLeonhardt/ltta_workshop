if you think about what governments do they provide for secure borders that's their number one challenge there are many global threats facing the president of the future one certainly is continues to be nuclear weapons and we can't look past this and of course front of mine is is Russia and what our relationship with Russia is we also have North Korea a very inscrutable leadership country is very unpredictable is very difficult to say what they would do but I think there's some other really pressing threads in the Middle East and the refugee crisis that that's created if the European Union can't get control of its borders that will be an existential issue if you think about what governments do they provide for secure borders that's their number one challenge and then security of their people if your European governments cannot be if they're seen as not securing their borders then what does that mean for their ability to rule their countries if Europe cannot control its borders if it is being seen as overrun by refugees if the Middle East continues to get worse Europe gets existentially challenged and that is a big issue for the United States because obviously Europe is an anchor for democracy for economy for liberal governance if they can't solve their problems that will then have serious knock-on effects for the United States
