oh yeah he's back one of our childhood heroes Jackie Chang's new movie the foreigner was released worldwide October 13th so a few things we have to ask ourselves is this movie one of the same inspirational amazing things that made me and everyone else think of karate as a kid is this a call to form for Jackie Chang who we haven't really seen since rush hour three and 2007 or is this film a transition film for him to go into new genres for this aging little movie legend that is Jackie Chang and what does this say for Christians as believers and why is it not quite right because of what it says about peace all right let's get in the movie now the foreigner is your typical revenge felt it's about a man named qualms whose daughter is killed this sets him off on this journey to go track down his daughter's killers this leads him down a path in conspiracy in a dark world involving the IRA now before we get into the actual details of it let's see how this movie was doing at the box office because that is always what Hollywood wants to know it's made almost 100 million dollars one weekend which is crazy but it's important to note that 12 million of it was domestic meaning United States most of the box office was worldwide which shows the incredible draw and appreciation that Jackie Chan has worldwide that's that's absolutely stunning but they accomplished now Martin Campbell is the director of this film Martin Campbell's done some great projects and some not-so-great projects some great wines like Casino right out one of the best James Bond movies also he did stuff like Green Lantern yeah so that means this could have gone anywhere now my critic review what I think about the critics my view is almost exactly what you'll see on Rotten Tomatoes it's kind of in and like right in the middle there's a few reasons for that one Martin did a pretty good job of mixing up the shots and you know setting things apart per scene every scene feels a little bit different but it is slow it is drawn-out it is dark I will say they did a good job of using practical effects the explosions and action sequences most the sets were real there wasn't a lot of CGI which speaks to the tone and what they wanted to accomplish in the movie they wanted the movie to be real and gritty ok and these movies when they do that are kind of hit or miss because it really depends on you caring enough about the person and then having the people be interesting enough to carry the story dark and depressing means it's boring and slow a lot of times and unfortunately this movie fell into that trap so my critic review is right at what the critics are saying which is about 50% I'm gonna give it a three out of five like kind of right in the middle this is slightly different for my viewer review now if you are a big Jackie Chan action movie fan like I am it's a little bit more fascinating and it's worth I see just because you could see this guy it's almost it was his bizarre fascination watching him because you see this guy do you remember for energy and comedy and excitement doing a complete 180 where he's slow go sulking and boring and for me it all that almost engaged me more than the plot of the story seeing this guy portraying a character completely different than where I've grown up and seen of them now in that world for an audience if you do not like Jackie Chan if you're not into these revenge films it's not gonna work for you there's a few reasons for that the number one reason is there's zero character arc in this movie like the characters are stagnant or the same person from beginning man so you'd only see a big transition it's predictable and you don't care that much about the characters the one that wasn't enough development in them like you know he loses daughter spoiler alert ok spoiler his daughter is lost but you didn't have any time to care about either one of them and you're just thrust in this confusing dark world the IRA in terrorism dollars just so you get it gets lost on you as an audience member now what's interesting for me is looking through the lens of faith on a project like this because we all deal with her we all deal with loss we all we want but we also want to stand up against Eve we all want to fight against evil and there's plenty of verses saying just went when it's ok with to it's not to ignore sin is is to send yourself and that's it's very important what's wrong with this film is there's no hope like one of the best revenge movies ever anything call it really in a rip revenge movie is that Liam Neeson's taken now take it is different because there is hope he didn't set on this journey to you know find these sex traffickers because he was wronged in the past he's just gonna kill these guys so he feels better he's going after them because his daughter is in jeopardy he's doing it for her he's not doing it for his own selfish reasons unfortunately in this movie Jackie Chang's daughter is already lost he's not gonna find any hope there's not gonna be any absolution for him and he's still gonna at the end of the day to my high people he kills he's gonna feel the same way in first Peter 3:9 that says do not repay evil with evil or insult with insult for on the contrary repay evil with blessing because to this you were called that you main at the blessing when you forgive and you let God be God and you be you and you do the best you can with what you have and not try to step out of the line that God's given you that is we're gonna find peace this we're gonna find hope because that he's never gonna get his daughter back and you know this going through the movie you know Jackie's never gonna fully be happy with what's going on and so you it's just inevitable this depressing through line through the entire movie that you might not notice unless you look through it through that lens of faith so that is my review of the foreigner tune in next time for my next rebel real review and until next time enjoy us
