158
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:50,770
a cop here and there is a racist and

159
00:05:50,770 --> 00:05:53,560
does something really bad it that's not

160
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:55,210
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> point that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is not the point Obama is</font>

161
00:05:55,210 --> 00:05:57,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">in Warsaw right he's in Warsaw and he</font>

162
00:05:57,610 --> 00:05:59,530
stops to make this speech<font color="#CCCCCC"> the first</font>

163
00:05:59,530 --> 00:06:02,949
Obama cut I can't comment on the

164
00:06:02,949 --> 00:06:08,710
specific facts of these cases<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I have</font>

165
00:06:08,710 --> 00:06:10,870
full confidence in the justice

166
00:06:10,870 --> 00:06:12,490
department's ability to conduct a

167
00:06:12,490 --> 00:06:16,419
thorough and fair inquiry but what I can

168
00:06:16,419 --> 00:06:21,969
say<font color="#E5E5E5"> is that all</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> us as Americans</font>

169
00:06:21,969 --> 00:06:27,490
should be troubled by these shootings

170
00:06:27,490 --> 00:06:33,060
because these are not isolated incidents

171
00:06:33,539 --> 00:06:37,870
they're symptomatic of a broader set of

172
00:06:37,870 --> 00:06:40,810
racial disparities that exist in our

173
00:06:40,810 --> 00:06:44,110
criminal justice system and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I just want</font>

174
00:06:44,110 --> 00:06:47,949
<font color="#E5E5E5">to give</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> people</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a few statistics to try</font>

175
00:06:47,949 --> 00:06:53,020
to put in context why emotions<font color="#E5E5E5"> are so</font>

176
00:06:53,020 --> 00:06:56,349
wrong around these<font color="#CCCCCC"> issues according to</font>

177
00:06:56,349 --> 00:06:59,139
various studies not just one but a wide

range of studies that<font color="#E5E5E5"> have been carried</font>

out over a number of years

180
00:07:04,530 --> 00:07:06,490
african-americans are thirty percent

181
00:07:06,490 --> 00:07:09,759

more likely to be searched last year

185

african-americans were shot by police at

186
00:07:23,590 --> 00:07:27,419
more than twice the rate of whites

187
00:07:27,419 --> 00:07:29,319
everything about that is wrong

188
00:07:29,319 --> 00:07:31,120
everything about it is wrong and it's

about<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's about them narrative first of</font>

all<font color="#E5E5E5"> those statistics are meaningless</font>

191
00:07:34,060 --> 00:07:35,380
because they don't take into account

00:07:35,380 --> 00:07:37,150
whether<font color="#E5E5E5"> black people commit more crimes</font>

whether Hispanics commit more crimes

194
00:07:38,620 --> 00:07:39,849
where the black<font color="#E5E5E5"> people reacted</font>

195
00:07:39,849 --> 00:07:42,009
differently when pulled over I'm not

196
00:07:42,009 --> 00:07:44,860
<font color="#CCCCCC">even going to talk about yet the idea of</font>

197
00:07:44,860 --> 00:07:47,229
<font color="#CCCCCC">the tension between the police because</font>

198

<font color="#E5E5E5">this is the new narrative they're</font>

199
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:50,409
selling is the fact of the amote that

200
00:07:50,409 --> 00:07:52,419
the first they create the emotion they

201
00:07:52,419 --> 00:07:54,219
create the distrust and then they say

202
00:07:54,219 --> 00:07:55,840
well the distrust is a problem<font color="#E5E5E5"> and yes</font>

203
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:57,639
it is it is a<font color="#E5E5E5"> problem but that's not</font>

204
00:07:57,639 --> 00:07:59,169
what he's talking about which I just

205
00:07:59,169 --> 00:08:00,400
want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to talk about narrative for a</font>

206
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:02,289
minute you know this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> what I've this</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">is how I've spent my life</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> making a</font>

208
00:08:03,639 --> 00:08:05,349
living is with narrative you don't tell

209
00:08:05,349 --> 00:08:07,539
a story because of its individual

210
00:08:07,539 --> 00:08:09,190
qualities Shakespeare doesn't write

211
00:08:09,190 --> 00:08:11,229
Hamlet because he wants you<font color="#E5E5E5"> to know</font>

212
00:08:11,229 --> 00:08:12,729
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> what it's like to be a prince in</font>

213
00:08:12,729 --> 00:08:14,590
Denmark nobody ever sits down and

214
00:08:14,590 --> 00:08:16,659
discuss discusses<font color="#E5E5E5"> Hamlet and says you</font>

215
00:08:16,659 --> 00:08:17,800
know what does this tell us about the

216
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:19,930
you know the Denmark principe because

217
00:08:19,930 --> 00:08:22,150
who cares who cares about<font color="#CCCCCC"> the Denver</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

218
00:08:22,150 --> 00:08:23,680
know the principality in Denmark what

219
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:25,000
you care about is the way Hamlet

220
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,099
represents something about the human

221
00:08:27,099 --> 00:08:29,650
condition every story is representative

222
00:08:29,650 --> 00:08:32,140
whether it's a true story or a fictional

223
00:08:32,140 --> 00:08:34,958
story the way the mainstream media works

224
00:08:34,958 --> 00:08:36,698
in the way Obama manipulates the

225
00:08:36,698 --> 00:08:38,289
mainstream<font color="#E5E5E5"> media is this is I've said</font>

226
00:08:38,289 --> 00:08:39,549
this before i'm going to read it off<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

227
00:08:39,549 --> 00:08:41,200
page so the first rule

228
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:43,270
of mainstream media news coverage in

229
00:08:43,270 --> 00:08:45,700
America whenever the prejudices and

230
00:08:45,700 --> 00:08:48,010
illusions of left wingers are confirmed

231
00:08:48,010 --> 00:08:50,290
by an individual incident the incident

232
00:08:50,290 --> 00:08:52,630
<font color="#CCCCCC">is treated as representative when those</font>

233
00:08:52,630 --> 00:08:54,100
prejudices and illusions are

234
00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:56,290
contradicted the incident is considered

235
00:08:56,290 --> 00:08:58,060
an aberration and treating it as

236
00:08:58,060 --> 00:09:00,280
representative is deemed hateful okay so

237
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:02,200
what<font color="#E5E5E5"> does</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that mean it means a white guy</font>

238
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:04,870
in Charleston a savage racist crazy man

239
00:09:04,870 --> 00:09:07,000
in Charleston shoot some black people<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

240
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,340
a church and suddenly you know the call

241
00:09:09,340 --> 00:09:10,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">Confederate flags have to be taken down</font>

242
00:09:10,870 --> 00:09:13,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">it just</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> shows you the still racism in</font>

243
00:09:13,510 --> 00:09:15,400
America you know racism eric has a

racist country in Dallas<font color="#E5E5E5"> the same it's</font>

man shoots a bunch of white people is

247
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:26,770
that representative of the race<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the</font>

248
00:09:26,770 --> 00:09:28,810
black racism in America when a Muslim

249
00:09:28,810 --> 00:09:30,580
kills somebody more<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the point really</font>

250
00:09:30,580 --> 00:09:32,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's the that's what suddenly it's</font>

251
00:09:32,110 --> 00:09:34,270
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't judge all muslims don't judge</font>

252
00:09:34,270 --> 00:09:36,880
all month you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> no so suddenly it's</font>

253
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:38,620
not representative and it's hateful to

254
00:09:38,620 --> 00:09:40,570
say it is representative that's the way

255
00:09:40,570 --> 00:09:42,160
they manipulate the narrative and so

256
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:43,960
when<font color="#CCCCCC"> he gets</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> up and says when he had</font>

257
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:45,670
something says I can't judge these

258
00:09:45,670 --> 00:09:47,710
individual incidents but<font color="#E5E5E5"> the point is</font>

259
00:09:47,710 --> 00:09:49,600
they're symptomatic let me think about

260
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:51,460
that for a minute symptomatic of what

261
00:09:51,460 --> 00:09:53,680
they symptomatic of policemen have to

262
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:56,050
defend<font color="#CCCCCC"> themselves the symptomatic of the</font>

263
00:09:56,050 --> 00:09:57,340
fact that blacks are more violent<font color="#CCCCCC"> than</font>

264
00:09:57,340 --> 00:09:58,270
whites you know what are they

265
00:09:58,270 --> 00:10:00,430
symptomatic of he's deciding what

266
00:10:00,430 --> 00:10:02,050
they're symptomatic of in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> statistics</font>

267
00:10:02,050 --> 00:10:04,030
that he quotes are meaningless<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so</font>

268
00:10:04,030 --> 00:10:05,920
now people are ginned up right<font color="#E5E5E5"> because</font>

269
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:07,780
the guy is that<font color="#E5E5E5"> president is the main</font>

narrative center of the country he's

271
00:10:09,970 --> 00:10:11,560
setting the narrative now people<font color="#CCCCCC"> who</font>

275
00:10:17,620 --> 00:10:19,360
black lives matter is inherently racist

276
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:21,550
but let's but let's put that aside there

277
00:10:21,550 --> 00:10:23,020
are<font color="#E5E5E5"> plenty of protests in this country</font>

278

lives matter movement he was a crazy guy

281
00:10:28,810 --> 00:10:31,690
let's let's<font color="#E5E5E5"> listen to David Brown the</font>

282
00:10:31,690 --> 00:10:34,690
Dallas<font color="#E5E5E5"> police chief describing the</font>

Micah Johnson it appears that our search

00:10:39,910 --> 00:10:43,450
of the suspects home<font color="#CCCCCC"> in mesquite leads</font>

286
00:10:43,450 --> 00:10:46,270
us to believe based on evidence of

bomb-making materials in a journal<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

there was large enough<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have</font>

292

devastating effects throughout our city

293
00:11:02,699 --> 00:11:06,269
in our North Texas area were convinced

294
00:11:06,269 --> 00:11:09,599
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> this suspect had other plans and</font>

295
00:11:09,599 --> 00:11:13,759
thought that what he was<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing was</font>

296
00:11:13,759 --> 00:11:16,769
righteous and<font color="#CCCCCC"> believed that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> he was going</font>

299
00:11:23,399 --> 00:11:27,619
as law enforcement efforts to punish

300
00:11:27,619 --> 00:11:31,229
people of color I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that this killer</font>

301
00:11:31,229 --> 00:11:34,739
obviously had some delusion there was

302
00:11:34,739 --> 00:11:36,959
quite<font color="#E5E5E5"> a bit of rambling in the journal</font>

303
00:11:36,959 --> 00:11:39,779
that that's hard to decipher I can just

304
00:11:39,779 --> 00:11:42,389
add at the scene where he was killed

305
00:11:42,389 --> 00:11:44,549
there was a boss he wrote some lettering

306
00:11:44,549 --> 00:11:48,419
in blood on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the walls which leads</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> us to</font>

stairwell on the second floor of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the L</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">a device to to end the standoff there</font>

311
00:11:59,309 --> 00:12:03,209
there was more lettering written in his

<font color="#E5E5E5">own blood what did he write we are we</font>

easy that's an amazing amazing emotional

statement that the police are in a

376
00:14:37,110 --> 00:14:39,329
relationship with the protesters that's

377
00:14:39,329 --> 00:14:41,100
like the relationship<font color="#E5E5E5"> of a lover who is</font>

00:15:06,810 --> 00:15:09,029
when Obama is talking about black people

393
00:15:09,029 --> 00:15:10,470
when people are talking about white or

394
00:15:10,470 --> 00:15:11,730
white people and black people why

395
00:15:11,730 --> 00:15:13,380

backtracks oh yeah I didn't mean I

421
00:15:59,620 --> 00:16:02,050
didn't mean to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get everybody all excited</font>

422
00:16:02,050 --> 00:16:04,630
if communities are mistrustful to the

423
00:16:04,630 --> 00:16:08,200
police<font color="#CCCCCC"> that makes those law enforcement</font>

424
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:09,850
officers who are<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing a great job and</font>

425
00:16:09,850 --> 00:16:11,920
are doing<font color="#CCCCCC"> the right</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> thing it makes their</font>

426
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:20,620
lives harder so so you know when people

427
00:16:20,620 --> 00:16:22,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">say black lives matter that doesn't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> mean</font>

428
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:24,190
blue lives don't matter it just means

429
00:16:24,190 --> 00:16:27,190
all lives matter but<font color="#E5E5E5"> right now the big</font>

430
00:16:27,190 --> 00:16:32,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">concern</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is the fact that the data shows</font>

431
00:16:32,790 --> 00:16:38,410
black folks are more vulnerable to these

432
00:16:38,410 --> 00:16:43,150
kinds of incidents this isn't a matter

433
00:16:43,150 --> 00:16:46,570
of us comparing the value of lives this

434
00:16:46,570 --> 00:16:50,890
is recognizing that there is a

435
00:16:50,890 --> 00:16:53,170
particular burden that is being placed

436
00:16:53,170 --> 00:16:59,050
on a group of our fellow citizens and we

437
00:16:59,050 --> 00:17:02,200
should<font color="#E5E5E5"> care about that we can't dismiss</font>

438
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:04,780
it you know that's that high-pitched

439
00:17:04,780 --> 00:17:06,430
stuttering voice he gets when it's not

440
00:17:06,430 --> 00:17:08,200
his fault you know I didn't draw a red

441
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:10,180
line is<font color="#CCCCCC"> mine my decision</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to pull out of</font>

443
00:17:12,460 --> 00:17:16,270
says he said racism is in America's DNA

444
00:17:16,270 --> 00:17:17,680
that's what he said oh but I'm not

445
00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:19,900
dividing the country now I'm not

446
00:17:19,900 --> 00:17:21,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">dividing the country and he says we were</font>

at Harvard and he takes on some very

512
00:19:42,250 --> 00:19:44,470
very controversial stuff for instance he

513
00:19:44,470 --> 00:19:48,280
tested whether to see if lower IQ rates

514
00:19:48,280 --> 00:19:51,370
in blacks were genetic or whether they

were<font color="#CCCCCC"> because of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the culture of that they</font>

they start to divert so that's obviously

00:20:04,539 --> 00:20:06,669
a cultural thing but<font color="#E5E5E5"> again it's the</font>

526
00:20:12,429 --> 00:20:14,020
we're listening<font color="#CCCCCC"> to obama talk about</font>

527
00:20:14,020 --> 00:20:16,210
black lives matter let's listen to Rudy

528
00:20:16,210 --> 00:20:18,549
Giuliani Rudy Giuliani mayor of New York

529
00:20:18,549 --> 00:20:21,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">best friend the black man ever had</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> four</font>

530
00:20:21,490 --> 00:20:24,039
<font color="#CCCCCC">thousand</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> lives I believe is the proper</font>

531
00:20:24,039 --> 00:20:26,140
statistic for the number who were saved

532
00:20:26,140 --> 00:20:28,539
by his policing techniques and every

533
00:20:28,539 --> 00:20:31,000
single<font color="#CCCCCC"> day the New York Times called him</font>

534
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,280
a racist every day remember was Giuliani

535
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:35,200
time when a black guy got beaten up by a

536
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:37,510
lousy cop it was Giuliani time they

537
00:20:37,510 --> 00:20:39,520
spread that lie that the<font color="#E5E5E5"> cops said that</font>

538
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:40,750
we don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to be nice to you anymore</font>

539
00:20:40,750 --> 00:20:42,309
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's Giuliani time it didn't happen</font>

540
00:20:42,309 --> 00:20:44,350
<font color="#CCCCCC">nobody ever said it but they spread that</font>

541
00:20:44,350 --> 00:20:46,750
this guy saved all those lives by

542
00:20:46,750 --> 00:20:49,480
installing this no tolerance<font color="#E5E5E5"> just listen</font>

543
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:51,010
to what he says about black lives matter

544
00:20:51,010 --> 00:20:53,710
so maybe whites have to look at<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

545
00:20:53,710 --> 00:20:55,450
differently and blacks have to look at

546
00:20:55,450 --> 00:20:57,400
it<font color="#CCCCCC"> differently whites have to realize</font>

547
00:20:57,400 --> 00:21:00,520
that african-american men have a fear

548
00:21:00,520 --> 00:21:03,100
and boys have a fear of being confronted

549
00:21:03,100 --> 00:21:05,350
by the police because of<font color="#E5E5E5"> some of these</font>

550
00:21:05,350 --> 00:21:07,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">incidents some people may consider it</font>

551
00:21:07,630 --> 00:21:09,070
rational some people considered

552
00:21:09,070 --> 00:21:11,650
irrational but it's a reality<font color="#E5E5E5"> it exists</font>

553
00:21:11,650 --> 00:21:14,380
and there's a second reality in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the in</font>

554
00:21:14,380 --> 00:21:16,120
<font color="#CCCCCC">the black community the second reality</font>

555
00:21:16,120 --> 00:21:18,370
in the black community is there's too

556
00:21:18,370 --> 00:21:20,530
much violence in the black community so

557
00:21:20,530 --> 00:21:25,240
a black will die one percent or less at

558
00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:26,799
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> hands of the police</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and ninety-nine</font>

559
00:21:26,799 --> 00:21:29,470
percent at the hands of a civilian most

560
00:21:29,470 --> 00:21:32,140
<font color="#CCCCCC">often another black so if you want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

561
00:21:32,140 --> 00:21:35,830
protect black lives so that's Giuliani

562
00:21:35,830 --> 00:21:37,990
you know doling out some facts that if

563
00:21:37,990 --> 00:21:39,100
you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> going to get killed it's the</font>

564
00:21:39,100 --> 00:21:40,539
people that the police arrest who are

565
00:21:40,539 --> 00:21:42,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to kill you it's not the police</font>

566
00:21:42,100 --> 00:21:43,240
we're going to kill you whether you're

567
00:21:43,240 --> 00:21:45,610
black or white but<font color="#E5E5E5"> again he has to say</font>

568
00:21:45,610 --> 00:21:47,890
as we all have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to say that the fact that</font>

569
00:21:47,890 --> 00:21:49,539
black people<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't trust the police</font>

570
00:21:49,539 --> 00:21:51,820
makes the relationship you know you want

571
00:21:51,820 --> 00:21:53,890
to go<font color="#CCCCCC"> into a neighborhood and have the</font>

572
00:21:53,890 --> 00:21:55,390
trust of the law-abiding people and

573
00:21:55,390 --> 00:21:56,999
remember remember

574
00:21:56,999 --> 00:21:58,679
majority of the people in black

575
00:21:58,679 --> 00:21:59,759
neighborhoods as in white neighborhoods

576
00:21:59,759 --> 00:22:02,489
are law-abiding people and those are<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

577
00:22:02,489 --> 00:22:04,199
<font color="#CCCCCC">people that need the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> police and trust</font>

578
00:22:04,199 --> 00:22:05,399
the police want the police<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you could</font>

579
00:22:05,399 --> 00:22:07,079
see them after these killings<font color="#E5E5E5"> that were</font>

580
00:22:07,079 --> 00:22:08,849
weeping for the cops you know they you

581
00:22:08,849 --> 00:22:12,059
know they understand<font color="#E5E5E5"> but it's not fair</font>

582
00:22:12,059 --> 00:22:14,789
to gin up that mistrust as Obama does

583
00:22:14,789 --> 00:22:16,889
with fall statistics and false narrative

584
00:22:16,889 --> 00:22:18,719
and false representation taking the

585
00:22:18,719 --> 00:22:20,369
incidents and making them representative

586
00:22:20,369 --> 00:22:21,899
that's what we're talking about taking a

587
00:22:21,899 --> 00:22:23,969
<font color="#E5E5E5">single individual incidents and saying</font>

588
00:22:23,969 --> 00:22:25,409
<font color="#E5E5E5">that they're symptomatic that's what he</font>

589
00:22:25,409 --> 00:22:27,389
does<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's not fair to gin up that</font>

590
00:22:27,389 --> 00:22:29,999
mistrust and then blame<font color="#E5E5E5"> that mistrust</font>

now a contributing editor he was the

editor of<font color="#CCCCCC"> City Journal he wrote he wrote</font>

596
00:22:40,679 --> 00:22:42,329
a wonderful book I believe was called

597
00:22:42,329 --> 00:22:45,299
the dream in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the nightmare of how the</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">and he wrote an article in city journal</font>

602

today and you should really<font color="#E5E5E5"> read it</font>

603

00:22:58,229 --> 00:22:59,579
at it<font color="#E5E5E5"> because he knows so much about</font>

in US history here's why the keynote of

611
00:23:11,459 --> 00:23:13,469
America's domestic politics for the last

he then talks about all the efforts to

get kids into school and remember you

of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the Civil</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> War Lincoln addressed the</font>

slavery<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the final accounting he said</font>

651
00:24:38,970 --> 00:24:40,830
it might turn out that mrs. Lincoln

were gonna<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to die to erase this</font>

659
00:24:58,080 --> 00:25:00,720
terrible sin of slavery but then when it

00:25:08,760 --> 00:25:11,250
unlike Lincoln America's first black

664
00:25:11,250 --> 00:25:12,929
president didn't bind up the nation's

665
00:25:12,929 --> 00:25:15,960
wounds but scratch them open every time

666
00:25:15,960 --> 00:25:18,000
police killed the black man<font color="#E5E5E5"> and that is</font>

667
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:21,630
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing you know I mean Obama has sold</font>

668
00:25:21,630 --> 00:25:23,220
this narrative because it works for him

669
00:25:23,220 --> 00:25:24,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">I I don't think he's cynical I actually</font>

670
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:26,909
think he believes this stuff but it's

671
00:25:26,909 --> 00:25:30,210
the 1970s he's selling us of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> 1970s</font>

672
00:25:30,210 --> 00:25:32,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">and he's bringing the horrible 1970s</font>

673
00:25:32,820 --> 00:25:35,940
back you know and people this thing with

<font color="#E5E5E5">never to blame for anything he never</font>

676
00:25:40,380 --> 00:25:42,210
said it he<font color="#E5E5E5"> never did it if it goes bad</font>

677
00:25:42,210 --> 00:25:43,889
it wasn't him it was somebody<font color="#E5E5E5"> else the</font>

00:25:43,889 --> 00:25:45,720
world through the red line he didn't say

00:25:45,720 --> 00:25:47,039
all this stuff he didn't bring this

680
00:25:47,039 --> 00:25:49,889
stuff to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> fore well he did he did do</font>

681
00:25:49,889 --> 00:25:51,870
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> and he used his tenor as a first</font>

black president with a with a black head

683
00:25:54,299 --> 00:25:56,760
of the Justice Department I mean at this

684
00:25:56,760 --> 00:25:59,340
point it's clear that America is willing

685
00:25:59,340 --> 00:26:01,559
<font color="#CCCCCC">to set this stuff</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> aside</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it is our their</font>

686
00:26:01,559 --> 00:26:03,840
individual racist sure is there racism

687
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:07,110
in institutional racism in America no

688
00:26:07,110 --> 00:26:08,460
there's not they're just not isn't

689
00:26:08,460 --> 00:26:11,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">anymore he could have healed this it was</font>

690
00:26:11,340 --> 00:26:13,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">although</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> were almost there and he has</font>

691
00:26:13,830 --> 00:26:15,779
set us back and for<font color="#E5E5E5"> that he bears a</font>

692
00:26:15,779 --> 00:26:17,730
terrible responsibility and one of the

693
00:26:17,730 --> 00:26:19,470
reasons he has done this by the way is

694
00:26:19,470 --> 00:26:21,929
to save his own failed presidency his

695
00:26:21,929 --> 00:26:23,920
presidency is a<font color="#E5E5E5"> failure but no</font>

696
00:26:23,920 --> 00:26:25,120
he wants to say the<font color="#E5E5E5"> first black</font>

697
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:27,520
president is a<font color="#E5E5E5"> failure because that's</font>

698
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:29,110
part of that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> their racial narrative</font>

699
00:26:29,110 --> 00:26:30,730
it's only by setting aside the color of

700
00:26:30,730 --> 00:26:32,350
the skin and thinking about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the the</font>

701
00:26:32,350 --> 00:26:34,390
badness of his ideas<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you can see</font>

702
00:26:34,390 --> 00:26:36,070
his presidency for what it is a total

703
00:26:36,070 --> 00:26:38,170
failure just<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> terrible weekend guys</font>

wetter called pre pub reviews so

718
00:27:06,580 --> 00:27:09,040
Publishers Weekly is kind of the variety

719
00:27:09,040 --> 00:27:11,500
of<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's the trade paper of publishing so</font>

720
00:27:11,500 --> 00:27:12,970
Publishers Weekly brought out a review

721
00:27:12,970 --> 00:27:14,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">and the review was wonderful they called</font>

722
00:27:14,440 --> 00:27:16,150
it fascinating they called a compelling

723
00:27:16,150 --> 00:27:17,920
there's a wonderful wonderful review

724
00:27:17,920 --> 00:27:19,240
this is just for booksellers it's not

725
00:27:19,240 --> 00:27:21,910
for the public but part of this story of

726
00:27:21,910 --> 00:27:24,670
my life is this amazing marriage<font color="#E5E5E5"> I have</font>

727
00:27:24,670 --> 00:27:26,320
had to my wife and what a wonderful

728
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:28,480
marriage has been and how the love that

729
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:30,580
exists between a man and woman that our

730
00:27:30,580 --> 00:27:32,470
marriage kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of set me on the path one</font>

731
00:27:32,470 --> 00:27:34,090
of the things that set me on the path to

732
00:27:34,090 --> 00:27:35,800
understanding that there was a greater

733
00:27:35,800 --> 00:27:37,360
love that informed that love and that

734
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:40,540
gave that love to us so this guy I think

735
00:27:40,540 --> 00:27:42,070
he read the<font color="#E5E5E5"> book but I just don't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think</font>

736
00:27:42,070 --> 00:27:43,000
he wrote the sentence grammatically

737
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:45,700
right and<font color="#CCCCCC"> and the book is practically a</font>

738
00:27:45,700 --> 00:27:47,350
love letter to my wife so he's writing

739
00:27:47,350 --> 00:27:50,320
this review and and I talked<font color="#E5E5E5"> about how i</font>

740
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:52,300
went into<font color="#E5E5E5"> a terrible period of despair</font>

741
00:27:52,300 --> 00:27:54,670
in my late 20 terrible terrible suicidal

742
00:27:54,670 --> 00:27:56,290
period I've really lived two lives I've

743
00:27:56,290 --> 00:27:57,730
lived that period up till that point and

744
00:27:57,730 --> 00:27:59,920
this amazing period I had afterwards of

745
00:27:59,920 --> 00:28:01,870
joy and growth and happy but up until

746
00:28:01,870 --> 00:28:03,490
that point I was<font color="#E5E5E5"> terrible's right and so</font>

747
00:28:03,490 --> 00:28:07,690
he wrote rights marriage marriage added

748
00:28:07,690 --> 00:28:09,880
to the complex picture filling the

749
00:28:09,880 --> 00:28:12,130
author with a despair they<font color="#E5E5E5"> would lead</font>

750
00:28:12,130 --> 00:28:17,560
him to seek<font color="#CCCCCC"> professional I think that's</font>

751
00:28:17,560 --> 00:28:19,720
what<font color="#CCCCCC"> you meant to say</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> but I've been I've</font>

her

755
00:28:25,960 --> 00:28:31,210
you filled the author with a despair if

756
00:28:31,210 --> 00:28:33,549
you wouldn't see a man struck down with

757
00:28:33,549 --> 00:28:35,350
