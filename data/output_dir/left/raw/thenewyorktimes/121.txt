1
00:00:10,910 --> 00:00:14,510
“He was 42 years old,
married, white guard.

2
00:00:14,510 --> 00:00:19,055
She’s a 19-year-old asylum
seeker with a 3-year-old.”

3
00:00:19,055 --> 00:00:23,750
In 2014, E.D. and her son
awaited asylum at Berks,

4
00:00:23,750 --> 00:00:26,360
a family detention
facility contracted

5
00:00:26,360 --> 00:00:28,820
by the U.S. Immigration
and Customs Enforcement

6
00:00:28,820 --> 00:00:31,670
agency, known as ICE.

7
00:00:31,670 --> 00:00:34,970
“Her life experience
is one in Honduras

8
00:00:34,970 --> 00:00:39,800
of being brutally beaten
and raped by her partner.

9
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:43,220
But she was also in this
Berks County facility

10
00:00:43,220 --> 00:00:49,220
that is purported to provide a
safe space for these families

11
00:00:49,220 --> 00:00:51,680
while they go through the
immigration process.”

12
00:01:02,180 --> 00:01:07,580
“He had been giving them favors,
given her little boy toys

13
00:01:07,580 --> 00:01:09,050
and candy.

14
00:01:09,050 --> 00:01:12,780
And he had told her that,
you know, he could help her out

15
00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:15,065
and that he was friends
with the deportation officer.”

16
00:01:26,125 --> 00:01:27,627
“I did have 
feelings for her.

17
00:01:27,627 --> 00:01:28,460
I mean, 
I liked her.

18
00:01:28,460 --> 00:01:33,050
I wasn’t having — my home
life wasn’t as great,

19
00:01:33,050 --> 00:01:37,160
so it was nice to have
somebody, you know, that

20
00:01:37,160 --> 00:01:38,630
would give me attention.”

21
00:01:38,630 --> 00:01:40,940
Early on, Sharkey
told his supervisors

22
00:01:40,940 --> 00:01:43,130
that E.D. was 
flirting with him.

23
00:01:43,130 --> 00:01:45,170
According to case
records, instead

24
00:01:45,170 --> 00:01:47,300
of transferring
Sharkey, the supervisor

25
00:01:47,300 --> 00:01:50,210
told him to keep his distance
and immediately report

26
00:01:50,210 --> 00:01:52,010
if anything else transpired.

27
00:01:52,010 --> 00:01:54,310
“It was a friendly
relationship at that time.

28
00:01:54,310 --> 00:01:55,510
That’s how it was.

29
00:01:55,510 --> 00:01:59,330
And then it just kind of
snowballed from there.”

30
00:02:16,370 --> 00:02:19,610
“Me being in a power position,
and her being kind of

31
00:02:19,610 --> 00:02:23,320
like, you know, being
a resident there,

32
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:24,965
she was never —
I mean —

33
00:02:24,965 --> 00:02:26,840
I never threatened her
or anything like that.

34
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:28,240
I never said any
of those words

35
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:30,330
to her to make her,
make her think that.”

36
00:02:32,710 --> 00:02:35,260
“This is a hallway
that everyone walks by.

37
00:02:35,260 --> 00:02:36,360
Guards walk by.

38
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:38,570
It’s by the
administrative wing.

39
00:02:38,570 --> 00:02:41,540
What we found out through
the words of Daniel Sharkey

40
00:02:41,540 --> 00:02:43,870
is they all knew.”

41
00:02:43,870 --> 00:02:46,000
Another detainee also knew.

42
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,980
According to her
deposition, Sharkey

43
00:02:47,980 --> 00:02:52,180
asked her to keep watch and
propositioned her for sex.

44
00:02:52,180 --> 00:02:54,580
Like E.D., several
thousand immigrants

45
00:02:54,580 --> 00:02:56,710
have claimed sexual
abuse in detention

46
00:02:56,710 --> 00:02:58,690
over the last decade.

47
00:02:58,690 --> 00:03:01,570
Currently, there are
nearly 42,000 immigrants

48
00:03:01,570 --> 00:03:04,180
in detention 
on any given day.

49
00:03:04,180 --> 00:03:06,160
President Trump has
already proposed

50
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:10,060
expanding detention capacity
for 2019, a plan that

51
00:03:10,060 --> 00:03:13,780
could lead to a 50 percent
increase of the daily population

52
00:03:13,780 --> 00:03:16,390
since he took office.

53
00:03:16,390 --> 00:03:19,600
His new executive order
ends family separation,

54
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:22,150
but expands family
detention, leading

55
00:03:22,150 --> 00:03:24,550
to an even larger
population of immigrants

56
00:03:24,550 --> 00:03:26,275
held in federal custody.

57
00:03:26,275 --> 00:03:28,180
“Any time you have a
particularly vulnerable

58
00:03:28,180 --> 00:03:32,530
population being detained in
a confined space, that creates

59
00:03:32,530 --> 00:03:35,400
a potential for abuse.”

60
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:37,060
“Many of these
women have never

61
00:03:37,060 --> 00:03:38,770
been in 
a detention facility.

62
00:03:38,770 --> 00:03:40,210
They didn’t 
commit a crime.

63
00:03:40,210 --> 00:03:42,400
This is all new,
to be in a facility

64
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:44,845
where they’re actually
treated as a prisoner.”

65
00:03:44,845 --> 00:03:47,380
“In the case of
women, the majority

66
00:03:47,380 --> 00:03:51,070
of those in immigration
detention are seeking asylum,

67
00:03:51,070 --> 00:03:55,240
and, in fact, are usually
fleeing violence.”

68
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:57,640
Ultimately, it was an
8-year-old girl’s eyewitness

69
00:03:57,640 --> 00:04:00,280
account that led to
an investigation.

70
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:02,410
Sharkey was fired from Berks.

71
00:04:02,410 --> 00:04:06,295
He later pleaded guilty to
institutional sexual assault.

72
00:04:06,295 --> 00:04:08,200
“I do not believe there’s
a culture of abuse.

73
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:11,530
For the past six years,
it’s been less than 1 percent

74
00:04:11,530 --> 00:04:14,155
of our population has
reported an incident.”

75
00:04:14,155 --> 00:04:17,740
ICE recorded over 1,300
allegations of sexual abuse

76
00:04:17,740 --> 00:04:19,959
and sexual assault
against detainees

77
00:04:19,959 --> 00:04:24,100
from fiscal years
2013 through 2017.

78
00:04:24,100 --> 00:04:26,800
Of these cases, ICE deemed
more than half of them

79
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:28,071
inconclusive.

80
00:04:28,071 --> 00:04:30,070
“Well, it’s certainly not
in their self-interest

81
00:04:30,070 --> 00:04:35,260
to have cases of sexual abuse
and assault confirmed.”

82
00:04:35,260 --> 00:04:37,960
Kevin Landy ran the office
responsible for reforming

83
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:42,010
ICE’s policies on sexual
abuse under President Obama.

84
00:04:42,010 --> 00:04:44,350
That office was closed
on the second day

85
00:04:44,350 --> 00:04:46,030
of the Trump Administration.

86
00:04:46,030 --> 00:04:47,800
ICE says the personnel
from that office

87
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:50,655
were incorporated
under another division.

88
00:04:50,655 --> 00:04:53,680
“Written policies
that the agency has on

89
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:56,180
responding to allegations
of sexual abuse and assault

90
00:04:56,180 --> 00:04:57,790
are very comprehensive.

91
00:04:57,790 --> 00:05:00,760
But the reality on the ground
is that there are still

92
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:03,100
some serious flaws
and challenges

93
00:05:03,100 --> 00:05:06,085
in how those policies
are being implemented.”

94
00:05:06,085 --> 00:05:08,560
There’s a network of
over 200 facilities

95
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:12,480
that ICE currently uses
to detain immigrants.

96
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:14,930
These range from facilities
run by private prison

97
00:05:14,930 --> 00:05:17,450
companies dedicated
exclusively

98
00:05:17,450 --> 00:05:20,320
to immigration detention,
to federal prisons

99
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:22,190
and contracted
county jails that

100
00:05:22,190 --> 00:05:25,190
host both inmates and
immigrant detainees.

101
00:05:25,190 --> 00:05:27,710
“The investigations that
ICE has in place right now

102
00:05:27,710 --> 00:05:31,430
to keep tabs on all of the
many facilities it oversees

103
00:05:31,430 --> 00:05:32,720
are not adequate.

104
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:37,220
It’s often like — almost
like a rubber stamp.

105
00:05:37,220 --> 00:05:41,180
You see facilities
passing their inspections

106
00:05:41,180 --> 00:05:43,400
with flying colors
year in and year out.”

107
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:45,950
Megan Mack was tasked with
investigating complaints

108
00:05:45,950 --> 00:05:49,100
and filing reports on
abuses for all of D.H.S.,

109
00:05:49,100 --> 00:05:52,302
including ICE, under the
Obama Administration.

110
00:05:52,302 --> 00:05:55,190
“Often we would
go to a facility

111
00:05:55,190 --> 00:05:57,500
and do an investigation,
and then years

112
00:05:57,500 --> 00:06:01,865
would go by without the
complaints being addressed.”

113
00:06:01,865 --> 00:06:03,980
Maria sought asylum
in the United States

114
00:06:03,980 --> 00:06:06,680
after fleeing
violence in Guatemala.

115
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:10,160
She spent over a month in an
immigration detention center.

116
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:13,070
She was permitted to
leave the facility in 2010

117
00:06:13,070 --> 00:06:14,300
while her case was pending.

118
00:06:50,015 --> 00:06:52,850
The man Maria is referring
to is Donald Dunn.

119
00:06:52,850 --> 00:06:55,340
He was a guard at the
T. Don Hutto Residential Center

120
00:06:55,340 --> 00:06:58,220
in Texas, where 
Maria was held.

121
00:06:58,220 --> 00:07:01,220
One of Dunn’s jobs was
to transport detainees.

122
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:15,610
“When he let her out of the
van at the Austin airport,

123
00:07:15,610 --> 00:07:16,600
she ran.

124
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:20,420
The guard there at the airport
asked her what was wrong

125
00:07:20,420 --> 00:07:23,000
and she immediately told
him what had happened.”

126
00:07:28,190 --> 00:07:30,320
ICE policy mandates
that detainees

127
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:33,860
be transferred with at least
one guard of the same sex.

128
00:07:33,860 --> 00:07:36,970
But according to case records,
Hutto violated that order

129
00:07:36,970 --> 00:07:40,130
77 times in less
than a year, allowing

130
00:07:40,130 --> 00:07:44,022
male guards, including Dunn,
to transport women alone.

131
00:07:44,022 --> 00:07:47,692
Ultimately, eight women 
testified in a civil suit.

132
00:07:47,692 --> 00:07:49,170
“Probably there
were many more,

133
00:07:49,170 --> 00:07:51,780
because these were the women
who could be tracked down

134
00:07:51,780 --> 00:07:55,575
and who were
willing to speak.”

135
00:07:55,575 --> 00:07:57,780
Donald Dunn served
less than two years

136
00:07:57,780 --> 00:08:01,860
on charges arising from his
assault on multiple women.

137
00:08:01,860 --> 00:08:04,110
The Hutto detention
center has recently

138
00:08:04,110 --> 00:08:06,870
been investigated by
the F.B.I. for other claims

139
00:08:06,870 --> 00:08:09,240
of sexual abuse
committed by guards.

140
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:12,660
And in June, a civil rights
group lodged new complaints

141
00:08:12,660 --> 00:08:14,490
accusing guards
of masturbating

142
00:08:14,490 --> 00:08:17,190
in front of female detainees
and forcing them

143
00:08:17,190 --> 00:08:19,740
into sex acts.

144
00:08:19,740 --> 00:08:22,020
Immigrant detention
in all its forms

145
00:08:22,020 --> 00:08:25,350
is expanding under the
Trump Administration.

146
00:08:25,350 --> 00:08:29,820
ICE is looking into options
for an additional 15,000 beds

147
00:08:29,820 --> 00:08:33,058
to detain parents
and their children.

148
00:08:33,058 --> 00:08:36,719
Families aside, Trump’s
“zero-tolerance policy”

149
00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:40,260
has taxed an already
overwhelmed system.

150
00:08:40,260 --> 00:08:42,240
As policies
continue to change,

151
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:45,180
and the administration
faces legal obstacles,

152
00:08:45,180 --> 00:08:47,790
the path forward is unclear.

153
00:08:47,790 --> 00:00:00,000
Meanwhile, those in detention
remain vulnerable to abuse.
