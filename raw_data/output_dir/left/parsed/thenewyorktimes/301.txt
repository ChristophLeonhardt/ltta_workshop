I know all of us here today
and across the entire nation
are grieving for the
community of Parkland
in the great state
of Florida.
We must do more to
protect our children.
We have to do more to
protect our children.
After the deadly
shooting in Las Vegas,
I directed the attorney
general to clarify
whether certain bump stock
devices like the one used
in Las Vegas are illegal
under current law.
That process began in December.
And just a few moments ago,
I signed a memorandum
directing the attorney general
to propose regulations
to ban all devices that
turn legal weapons
into machine guns.
I expect that these
critical regulations will
be finalized — Jeff — very soon.”
