1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:04,300
AS ALWAYS ONCE A SHOOTER'S
NAME GETS OUT, WE MIND THE

2
00:00:04,300 --> 00:00:05,300
INTERNET

3
00:00:05,300 --> 00:00:14,860
TO FIND THEM.

4
00:00:14,860 --> 00:00:20,430
THEY FOUND THIS
GUY ONLINE AND FOUND THAT HE

5
00:00:20,430 --> 00:00:24,260
ABSOLUTELY DESPISED REPUBLICANS
AND DONALD TRUMP IN PARTICULAR.

6
00:00:24,260 --> 00:00:27,200
HE PREVIOUSLY SAID THINGS ABOUT

7
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:31,620
THE CONGRESSMAN THAT WAS SHOT,
BUT ALSO THAT HE HAD LIKED

8
00:00:31,620 --> 00:00:33,289
BERNIE SANDERS AT SOME POINT.

9
00:00:33,289 --> 00:00:35,750
HE
HAD APPARENTLY VOLUNTEERED FOR

10
00:00:35,750 --> 00:00:38,329
BERNIE SANDERS.

11
00:00:38,329 --> 00:00:41,350
MANY ON THE
RIGHT EVEN SOME LIBERALS THOUGHT

12
00:00:41,350 --> 00:00:46,480
THEY COULD CASH IN ON THIS.

13
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:47,719
SO
THE ATTACKS AGAINST BERNIE

14
00:00:47,719 --> 00:00:50,829
SANDERS AND HIS SUPPORTERS BEGAN

15
00:00:50,829 --> 00:00:52,149
IMMEDIATELY.

16
00:00:52,149 --> 00:00:56,350
BERNIE SANDERS DID
NOT NEED TO COMMENT ON THIS BUT

17
00:00:56,350 --> 00:01:01,239
TO HIS CREDIT HE DID IN WRITTEN
FORM AND ON THE FLOOR OF

18
00:01:01,239 --> 00:01:02,239
CONGRESS.

19
00:01:02,239 --> 00:01:07,110
I HAVE JUST BEEN INFORMED
THAT THE ALLEGED SHOOTER THE

20
00:01:07,110 --> 00:01:12,090
REPUBLICAN BASEBALL PRACTICE
THIS MORNING, WAS SOMEONE WHO

21
00:01:12,090 --> 00:01:16,470
APPARENTLY VOLUNTEER MY
PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN.

22
00:01:16,470 --> 00:01:17,470
I AM

23
00:01:17,470 --> 00:01:24,331
SICKENED BY THIS DESPICABLE ACT,
AND LET ME BE AS CLEAR AS I CAN

24
00:01:24,331 --> 00:01:31,460
BE, VIOLENCE OF ANY KIND IS
UNACCEPTABLE IN OUR SOCIETY, AND

25
00:01:31,460 --> 00:01:33,570
I CONDEMN THIS ACTION IN THE

26
00:01:33,570 --> 00:01:37,290
STRONGEST POSSIBLE TERMS.

27
00:01:37,290 --> 00:01:40,360
REAL
CHANGE CAN ONLY COME ABOUT

28
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:47,000
THROUGH NONVIOLENT ACTION AND
ANYTHING ELSE RUNS COUNTER TO

29
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,850
OUR MOST DEEPLY HELD AMERICAN

30
00:01:49,850 --> 00:01:51,730
VALUES.

31
00:01:51,730 --> 00:01:54,860
I KNOW I SPEAK FOR THE
ENTIRE COUNTRY AND SAYING THAT

32
00:01:54,860 --> 00:01:59,110
MY HOPES AND PRAYERS ARE THAT
REPRESENTATIVE SCALISE,

33
00:01:59,110 --> 00:02:04,180
CONGRESSIONAL STAFF, AND THE
POLICE OFFICERS WHO WERE WOUNDED

34
00:02:04,180 --> 00:02:06,790
MAKE A QUICK AND FULL RECOVERY.

35
00:02:06,790 --> 00:02:10,660
I ALSO WANT TO THINK THE CAPITAL
POLICE FOR THEIR HEROIC

36
00:02:10,660 --> 00:02:14,299
ACTIONS TO PREVENT FURTHER HARM.

37
00:02:14,299 --> 00:02:16,680
I'M GLAD HE MADE THAT
COMMENT.

38
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:20,790
WHAT I NOTICED IS THAT

39
00:02:20,790 --> 00:02:22,299
IT IS THE MESSAGE THAT HAS BEEN

40
00:02:22,299 --> 00:02:25,989
DELIVERING FOR OVER 41 YEARS.

41
00:02:25,989 --> 00:02:31,010
THE PEOPLE THAT ARE SAYING THAT

42
00:02:31,010 --> 00:02:43,730
HE 

43
00:02:43,730 --> 00:02:46,659
COULD BE RESPONSIBLE HAS
NEVER LISTENED TO BERNIE SANDERS

44
00:02:46,659 --> 00:02:47,659
SPEAK.

45
00:02:47,659 --> 00:02:51,569
ONE OF THE THINGS ABOUT
BERNIE THAT WE ALL UNDERSTOOD

46
00:02:51,569 --> 00:02:56,269
EARLY ON IS THAT ONE OF THE
BENEFITS IS THAT HE DOESN'T DRAW

47
00:02:56,269 --> 00:02:57,829
IN TRADITIONAL DEMOCRATS OR

48
00:02:57,829 --> 00:03:00,629
LIPS, HIS APPEAL IS BROADER.

49
00:03:00,629 --> 00:03:03,280
THAT MEANS MODERATES AND

50
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:05,730
CONSERVATIVES LIKE HIM, OR AT
LEAST SOME OF HIS POLICIES.

51
00:03:05,730 --> 00:03:06,730
GOD

52
00:03:06,730 --> 00:03:09,659
ONLY KNOWS WHAT THIS GUY'S
BACKGROUND WAS FIVE OR 10 YEARS

53
00:03:09,659 --> 00:03:12,019
AGO.

54
00:03:12,019 --> 00:03:17,079
WHEN YOU POINT OUT IN THE
WAKE OF A TERROR ATTACK,

55
00:03:17,079 --> 00:03:20,109
SOMETIMES ON TYT WE HAVE
CRITICIZED THE RHETORIC COMING

56
00:03:20,109 --> 00:03:24,849
OUT OF THE MEDIA FIGURES OR
POLITICIANS.

57
00:03:24,849 --> 00:03:25,849
YOU MIGHT THINK

58
00:03:25,849 --> 00:03:29,370
THIS IS HYPOCRITICAL THAT BERNIE
SANDERS IS RESPONSIBLE.

59
00:03:29,370 --> 00:03:30,370
BUT

60
00:03:30,370 --> 00:03:33,939
POLITICIANS ARE NOT RESPONSIBLE
FOR WHAT THEIR SUPPORTERS DO IN

61
00:03:33,939 --> 00:03:38,260
THE ABSTRACT, THEY ARE
RESPONSIBLE WITH THEIR RHETORIC.

62
00:03:38,260 --> 00:03:40,019
AND DONALD TRUMP DID THAT

63
00:03:40,019 --> 00:03:41,489
MULTIPLE TIMES DURING HIS
CAMPAIGN.

64
00:03:41,489 --> 00:03:42,489
HE ALSO DID IT DURING

65
00:03:42,489 --> 00:03:44,499
PARTICULAR POLITICIANS.

66
00:03:44,499 --> 00:03:50,419
THAT 
HAS

67
00:03:50,419 --> 00:03:51,620
BEEN THE CASE OF PEOPLE IN THE

68
00:03:51,620 --> 00:03:53,060
RIGHT-WING MEDIA.

69
00:03:53,060 --> 00:03:54,060
IF BERNIE

70
00:03:54,060 --> 00:03:58,260
SANDERS HAD SAID THE 1% HAS TOO
MUCH MONEY, YOU CAN CHOP THEIR

71
00:03:58,260 --> 00:04:01,599
HEADS OFF, HE WOULD BE
RESPONSIBLE.

72
00:04:01,599 --> 00:04:02,599
BUT THAT IS NOT AN

73
00:04:02,599 --> 00:04:04,959
ACTUAL QUOTE.

74
00:04:04,959 --> 00:04:10,419
LOOK IT UP.

75
00:04:10,419 --> 00:04:15,559
I ALSO THINK YOU CAN'T
CONFLATE WHAT ONE PERSON

76
00:04:15,559 --> 00:04:17,589
BELIEVES WITH WHAT AN ENTIRE

77
00:04:17,589 --> 00:04:20,839
MOVEMENT BELIEVES OR WHAT A
COUPLE OF PEOPLE BELIEVE.

78
00:04:20,839 --> 00:04:21,839
MY

79
00:04:21,839 --> 00:04:25,169
ISSUE IS YOU CAN ONLY HOLD
BERNIE SANDERS RESPONSIBLE FOR

80
00:04:25,169 --> 00:04:26,770
WHAT HAS COME OUT OF HIS MOUTH.

81
00:04:26,770 --> 00:04:28,569
HE HAS NOT ONCE INCITED

82
00:04:28,569 --> 00:04:29,650
VIOLENCE.

83
00:04:29,650 --> 00:04:35,160
IF YOU THINK HIS
RHETORIC IS THE SAME AS TERMS,

84
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:49,389
PLEASE SHOW IT TO ME.

85
00:04:49,389 --> 00:04:51,639
NOW IF YOU
WANT TO TALK ABOUT SOME ON THE

86
00:04:51,639 --> 00:04:55,919
LEFT WHO MIGHT INCITE VIOLENCE
USING RHETORIC MAYBE THOSE CASES

87
00:04:55,919 --> 00:04:58,300
DO HAPPEN?

88
00:04:58,300 --> 00:05:01,360
KATHY GRIFFIN'S
RIDICULOUS PHOTO, WE SPOKE OUT

89
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:03,300
AGAINST IT.

90
00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:07,889
IT WAS BAD IMAGERY
AND YOU WANT TO ENCOURAGE PEOPLE

91
00:05:07,889 --> 00:05:10,300
TO COMMIT ACTS OF VIOLENCE.

92
00:05:10,300 --> 00:05:12,569
BUT
BLAMING BERNIE SANDERS IS

93
00:05:12,569 --> 00:05:13,710
RIDICULOUS.

94
00:05:13,710 --> 00:05:16,590
I'M NOT JUST TALKING
TO CONSERVATIVES, BECAUSE WE SEE

95
00:05:16,590 --> 00:05:19,889
LIBERALS DOING IT AS WELL.

96
00:05:19,889 --> 00:05:22,789
JOY READ.

97
00:05:22,789 --> 00:05:28,289
SHE'S NUTS.

98
00:05:28,289 --> 00:05:30,810
YOU HIT IT ON THE HEAD WHEN
YOU SAID THIS CONFLATION BETWEEN

99
00:05:30,810 --> 00:05:31,880
WHATEVER THE ALRIGHT IS WITH

100
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:43,430
THIS ALL LEFT IDEA 
JUST DOESN'T

101
00:05:43,430 --> 00:05:44,490
EXIST.

102
00:05:44,490 --> 00:05:46,870
EVEN THIS GUY, HE

103
00:05:46,870 --> 00:05:47,870
ABANDONED BERNIE SANDERS AND

104
00:05:47,870 --> 00:05:50,000
BRACED HILLARY'S CAMPAIGN.

105
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:53,520
IT IS
ABSURDLY DISINGENUOUS TO ZERO

106
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:54,520
IN.

107
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:58,270
HE TWEETED SOME THINGS AFTER
THE ELECTION THAT SEEMED MORE

108
00:05:58,270 --> 00:06:00,970
SUPPORTIVE OF HILLARY, BUT I
READ THAT HE SAID YOU SHOULD

109
00:06:00,970 --> 00:06:04,520
EITHER THEORETICALLY RIGHT IN
BERNIE OR VOTE FOR JOEL STEIN.

110
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:07,710
BUT LATER ON HE SAID HE
FOCUSED ON JUST DONALD TRUMP AND

111
00:06:07,710 --> 00:06:08,750
SAID HILLARY DIDN'T DO ANYTHING

112
00:06:08,750 --> 00:06:09,750
WRONG.

113
00:06:09,750 --> 00:06:11,650
BUT IT DOESN'T MATTER.

114
00:06:11,650 --> 00:06:18,590
THE ONLY PERSON WHO IS
RESPONSIBLE IS THE SHOOTER AND

115
00:06:18,590 --> 00:06:19,840
ANYONE WHO MIGHT'VE ENCOURAGED

116
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:23,629
HIM ñ RIGHT NOW WE DON'T KNOW
WHO ENCOURAGED HIM OR IF ANYONE

117
00:06:23,629 --> 00:06:27,070
INCITED VIOLENCE.

118
00:06:27,070 --> 00:06:30,389
THE ONE THING
WE DO KNOW IS THAT BERNIE

119
00:06:30,389 --> 00:06:32,289
SANDERS IS NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR
THIS.

120
00:06:32,289 --> 00:06:33,289
HE DOES NOT CONDONE

121
00:06:33,289 --> 00:06:35,379
VIOLENCE AND HAS NEVER EVER

122
00:06:35,379 --> 00:06:36,570
ENCOURAGED VIOLENCE.

123
00:06:36,570 --> 00:06:41,270
AND TO USE
YOUR DISDAIN FOR BERNIE SANDERS

124
00:06:41,270 --> 00:06:46,189
OR USE THIS HORRIBLE TRAGIC
EVENT IN ORDER TO SHOW YOUR

125
00:06:46,189 --> 00:06:51,449
DISDAIN SHOWS THAT YOU JUST HAVE
AN AGENDA AND YOU DON'T REALLY

126
00:06:51,449 --> 00:06:53,270
CARE ABOUT THE FACTS.

127
00:06:53,270 --> 00:06:55,710
YOU JUST WANT TO PLACE THE
BLAME ON SOMEONE.

128
00:06:55,710 --> 00:07:06,580
SO WHY ZERO IN ON BERNIE
SANDERS?

129
00:07:06,580 --> 00:07:12,650
IT IS JUST COMPLETELY

130
00:07:12,650 --> 00:07:16,069
DISINGENUOUS AND HORRIBLE.

131
00:07:16,069 --> 00:07:19,389
I KNOW SHE IS JUST ONE PERSON
WHO HAS DONE THIS AND THERE ARE

132
00:07:19,389 --> 00:07:23,430
A LOT OTHERS BUT THE JOY RETWEET
ñ

133
00:07:23,430 --> 00:07:27,580
WHAT IS GOING ON WITH HER?

134
00:07:27,580 --> 00:07:31,800
SHE TOOK SOME FAKE FACT THAT
WAS TWEETED TO HER AND AGREED

135
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:32,800
WITH IT.

136
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:35,210
THAT BERNIE'S CAREER

137
00:07:35,210 --> 00:07:38,710
HAS BEEN PROPPED UP BY THE NRA.

138
00:07:38,710 --> 00:07:40,889
WHAT?

139
00:07:40,889 --> 00:07:45,729
THAT WAS HER TAKE.

140
00:07:45,729 --> 00:07:47,979
WOW.

141
00:07:47,979 --> 00:07:52,349
I KNOW PARTIES ARE COMPLEX
AND THERE ARE MULTIPLE FACTIONS

142
00:07:52,349 --> 00:07:57,449
AND THE IDEA THAT PEOPLE ARE
TRYING TO KEEP THINGS ARE SIMPLY

143
00:07:57,449 --> 00:07:59,770
GOING TO LAY DOWN AND LET THE
NEW GROUP TAKE OVER?

144
00:07:59,770 --> 00:08:00,770
I KNEW THAT

145
00:08:00,770 --> 00:08:01,770
WAS NOT GOING TO HAPPEN.

146
00:08:01,770 --> 00:08:03,660
BUT WE
CAN HAVE AN ACTUAL DEBATE ABOUT

147
00:08:03,660 --> 00:08:05,150
THINGS WE HAVE SAID.

148
00:08:05,150 --> 00:08:08,520
WE ARE NOT
GOING TO HAVE THAT DEBATE BY

149
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:10,610
MAKING UP RIDICULOUS BS AND

150
00:08:10,610 --> 00:08:14,009
SMEARING A GUY WHO HAS MORE
INTEGRITY THAN ANY OTHER

151
00:08:14,009 --> 00:08:15,470
POLITICIAN IN WASHINGTON AT THIS

152
00:08:15,470 --> 00:08:20,689
POINT.

153
00:08:20,689 --> 00:08:23,969
COMMENTING ON THIS IS ONE OF
THE MOST ANNOYING THINGS BECAUSE

154
00:08:23,969 --> 00:08:25,069
I CAN'T WIN.

155
00:08:25,069 --> 00:08:27,430
REALLY CARE ABOUT
WINNING BUT YOU HAVE THE

156
00:08:27,430 --> 00:08:28,680
HARD-CORE BERNIE SUPPORTERS WHO

157
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:33,179
THINK I AM A CORPORATIST, AND
THEN YOU HAVE THE HILLARY PEOPLE

158
00:08:33,179 --> 00:08:35,689
THAT ARE LIKE YOU ARE PART OF
THE REASON WHY HILLARY LOST THE

159
00:08:35,690 --> 00:08:37,179
ELECTION.

160
00:08:37,179 --> 00:08:39,469
EVERYONE HATES ME AND
THINKS WE ARE TERRIBLE.

161
00:08:39,470 --> 00:08:40,470
WHATEVER, I DON'T CARE.

162
00:08:40,470 --> 00:08:41,470
BUT WHAT

163
00:08:41,470 --> 00:08:46,290
I DO CARE ABOUT IS JUST KEEPING
IT REAL WITH BOTH SIDES,

164
00:08:46,290 --> 00:08:48,550
ESPECIALLY THE SIDE THE JOY READ

165
00:08:48,550 --> 00:08:49,820
IS ON.

166
00:08:49,820 --> 00:08:55,540
IF YOU ARE FRUSTRATED AT
THE FACT THAT HILLARY LOST THE

167
00:08:55,540 --> 00:08:59,690
ELECTION INSTEAD OF GETTING
ANGRY AND ANTAGONIZING PEOPLE,

168
00:08:59,690 --> 00:09:04,029
ONE OF YOU LISTEN TO THEM AND
LISTEN TO THEIR ACTUAL CONCERNS.

169
00:09:04,029 --> 00:09:07,339
DEMONIZING THEM WILL NOT BODE

170
00:09:07,339 --> 00:09:12,360
WELL FOR YOU OR YOUR PARTY TO
YEARS FROM NOW AND CERTAINLY NOT

171
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:14,620
THREE TO HALF YEARS FROM NOW.

172
00:09:14,620 --> 00:09:15,620
WAKE UP.

173
00:09:15,620 --> 00:09:16,850
THEY ARE JUST SO BITTER

174
00:09:16,850 --> 00:09:20,000
ABOUT THE FACT THAT THEY LOST.

175
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:25,529
MAYBE THEY HAVE REAL GENUINE

176
00:09:25,529 --> 00:09:27,500
CONCERNS WE NEED TO REPRESENT?

177
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:32,000
THEY ARE INCAPABLE OF SELF
CRITIQUE.

178
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,320
THEY CAN'T LOOK AT WHY

179
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:35,060
THEY LOST, AND HOW THEY CAN WIN.

180
00:09:35,060 --> 00:09:39,510
IF CORBIN WASN'T REVEALING OF
HOW THE LEFT ACTUALLY DOES HAVE

181
00:09:39,510 --> 00:09:44,970
A LOT OF STANDING ñ AGAIN THE
CONFLATION OF TRYING TO TIE THIS

182
00:09:44,970 --> 00:09:46,130
HORSESHOE THEORY WHERE YOU ARE

183
00:09:46,130 --> 00:09:51,720
SO LEFT, AND JUST APOLOGIZING
FOR THIS.

184
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:54,110
I'M AT SOME POINT GOING TO
HAVE TO SIT DOWN AND ORGANIZE MY

185
00:09:54,110 --> 00:09:56,810
THOUGHTS ON THIS.

186
00:09:56,810 --> 00:10:02,790
THERE IS THIS
WEIRD IDEA ñ THIS OBSESSION OF

187
00:10:02,790 --> 00:10:04,639
SHOWING HOW IDEOLOGICALLY PURE

188
00:10:04,639 --> 00:10:06,290
UR.

189
00:10:06,290 --> 00:10:17,740
THERE IS ONE SPECTRUM YOU
CAN BE ON. AND AS YOU DO THINGS

190
00:10:17,740 --> 00:10:19,279
YOU ARE JUST MOVING TO THE LEFT

191
00:10:19,279 --> 00:10:21,390
AND THE RIGHT.

192
00:10:21,390 --> 00:10:23,120
THAT IS NOT HOW
LIFE IS.

193
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:24,120
LIFE IS MORE

194
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:25,120
COMPLICATED THAN THAT.

195
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:26,639
YOU CAN
MOVE MORE PROGRESSIVE OR MORE

196
00:10:26,639 --> 00:10:30,889
CONSERVATIVE YOU CAN ALSO MOVE
MORE WISE OR LESS WISE, MORE

197
00:10:30,889 --> 00:10:33,589
FOOLISH OR MORE AGGRESSIVE.

198
00:10:33,589 --> 00:10:35,589
THOSE ARE NOT THE SAME THINGS.

199
00:10:35,589 --> 00:10:37,990
YOU CAN HAVE WHATEVER POSITION

200
00:10:37,990 --> 00:10:40,120
YOU WANT ON POLITICS BUT CAN
ALSO

201
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:55,660
BE A REAL BIG FUCKING ASSHOLE.

202
00:10:55,660 --> 00:10:57,480
PEOPLE NEED TO BE ANALYTICAL BUT

203
00:10:57,480 --> 00:11:00,550
NOT JUST ABOUT THEIR POLITICAL
VALUES AND GOALS, BUT ALSO

204
00:11:00,550 --> 00:11:01,899
EVERYTHING ELSE THAT MAKES A

205
00:11:01,899 --> 00:00:00,000
HUMAN.
