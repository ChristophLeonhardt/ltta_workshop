President Trump has unveiled to Congress how many US troops are stationed abroad only the biannual White House reporter emitted some key figures the paragraphs talking about Afghanistan Iraq and Syria not a single number was given troop numbers were disclosed over Jordan and Lebanon the omitted figures come as a surprise given that the US Defense Secretary apparently revealed them himself a few months ago we have approximately 11,000 troops in Afghanistan and that is seen in our edition of over 3,000 US troops arriving now and in the coming months to extend NATO's advisory effort to Afghan troops that are currently without the number for Iraq is 5,200 and the number for Syria's 2000 when the White House provided figures on troop involvement abroad six months ago some were surprised the number of US lawmakers had no idea that American soldiers were stationed in Niger but I didn't know there was a thousand troops in Niger you heard senator Graham there he didn't know we had a thousand troops in Nazir did you all right no I did not and according to a report by the US military Journal stars and stripes as many as 44 thousand US troops stationed across the world are not tracked by the Pentagon that's of 1.3 million in total around 300,000 US personnel serve outside of America in more than 150 countries in the world we have requested a comment from the Department of Defense they said that some personnel are indeed marked under unknown location that's due to them being out at sea for example while also adding that data center figures may indeed not accurately reflect the current force totals leaving it open to debate just how many of those 44,000 could be unaccounted for okay let's bring in a guest to discuss this theory more depth that former US Senator Ron Paul and indeed founder the Ron Paul Institute pleasure to have you on sir what do you make of the fact the numbers were not unveiled by the White House basically just numbers of troops missing what what could possibly be the reason behind this well unfortunately we don't get like surprise it's sort of the routine especially with the new administration because the president has stated that he wants to keep everything under misunderstandings that proper policy but it's not good a good law because the Constitution said he's not a lot of sent troops around the world without the people in the Congress knowing about it and we also added to that was the war power resolution after the Vietnam War the war that said that the they must report where the troops are but here it is thousands the numbers have been thrown around 44,000 they don't know where they are but I have a suggestion for him if they were interested in cleaning up this mess because it's wrong and that is bring the troops home then can we can calm them here at home but it's when they're in a hundred and fifty countries or more if it gets very difficult especially if they say well this is secret we can't let the people know we can't let the enemy know where our troops are so they put American people in the category of the enemy because we're not allowed to know and my Institute and I've been in Congress and I've been on the Foreign Affairs Committee I'm not allowed to know and you just quoted a couple that are supposed to really know what's going on they may be very happy and satisfied with it but they still don't even know what's going on so it's it's really government out of control but it's what's what what this reflects is a foreign policy that our Institute the Ron Poe Institute disagrees with we don't think it's in our interest we don't think it's in interested of our security and we we don't believe this brings peace and we don't bring it prosperity so we have practical reasons and legal reasons why we don't think these troops should be overseas and if there's any of them overseas we should know exactly where they are because who knows they may be shooting off guns and bombs and drones and getting ourselves into a mess that we don't want to be in now James mattis had blamed this problem previously on the fact that he inherited it it wasn't a very good system that's why they didn't know where troops well it's sort of a listen to what he said there's a very strange accounting procedure I inherited that I'm what I'm probably going to end up doing is putting everyone into one thing that here's how many are really there now because it's more I found out the one I'd read in the newspaper when I got here I found it amazing you know he's basically blaming the accountants here and he's saying you know if we lose some soldiers it's not my fault it's you know it's the paperwork but who's going to hold mattes and Trump to account on this presumably the you know the politicians would consider this to be a really big issue and as you said unconstitutional yeah but they don't seem to be real worried about it I think in the people we try to awaken the people to what's going on and we haven't been very successful on that they're - they're too complacent but but we should know because it's very serious and not only is it a legal issue it's a very dangerous issue it's a financial issue as well so the the big problem is is what are they doing there but the problem here is for us to change this attitude about where the troops are we have to change our foreign policy that is one of our goals at the Institute is try to say that our foreign policy is wrong we're interventionist we tell other people how to run their countries we get involved in elections that we shouldn't be involved in we're the policemen of the world and it doesn't serve our interests so what we need to do is change people's minds but I'll tell you what they the propagandists for getting us involved in war whether it was the lead up to the Iraq war or even under Obama when he led up to say hey Salta has to go and look how long we've been there and that didn't do us any good but the propaganda by the deep state because they have a lot of control of the media they have a lot of color control of the money the military-industrial complex has a lot of influence with the members of Congress and a big bucks but my theory is it's all going to quit because empires like this and because you end up either getting into a deep problem overseas or you've run out of money I think we're gonna run out of money because we really have but the we are credit is good still with foreign governments and foreign central bank's because we print money like crazy and still everybody takes it but less so than they used to and I'm very much aware of that and and that sort of is the signs that eventually that will change our foreign policy and also the runaway welfare spending which should be a goal if you want to live in a free society what do you make of the report by the Stars and Stripes even if you take into account some missions are classified it still leaves a large number unknown I mean could this be used just as an excuse you know we don't know where the troops are it's incompetence but actually they could be used for covert operations yeah I'm sure they are and that's their excuse but that should not happen in in a republic I mean people are supposed to know what's going on the people are supposed to speak out the people are supposed to tell their members of Congress when we should get involved in hostilities and once again it's the theory of what our responsibilities are around the world and that is not what we accept at the Institute we believe that our role should be to develop friendships and trade with countries there in most every country in the world is imperfect including ours but our immediate goal should be to improve ourselves and not pretend that we can tell other people how to live and who should run their countries even though there are plenty of problems around but I don't think other people like us to take this role of secretly putting troops around the world and interfering and saying well we're going to improve your your governments and we're going to tell you what to do if you don't do what we want we're going to put sanctions on you so and that's that is why I think we're losing credibility is because right now sanctions used to be absolutely automatic but people can get around sanctions and and that is their desire they'll get around in one way the other and I think this moves some of the countries in the directions of how can we exceeded our system and that's big stuff if people leave the dollar I think our country is going to be in and I've argued that case for a long time that if if if if we lose control that that's going to be very damaging but right now this is what's happening people are getting disgusted and they would like to have an alternative reserve currency of course I believe in a reserve currency but believe it ought to be gold I don't believe it should be done by any politician or any government it shouldn't be fiat shouldn't be just printed money that's how governments really get into trouble and they overextend and they live off debt and you can't live off debt forever individuals can't do it and eventually governments can't do it well the printing of fit money that's a conversation we really could get into fortunately no time for that now but maybe some other day I certainly hope so former US congressman Ron Paul is my guest thank you
