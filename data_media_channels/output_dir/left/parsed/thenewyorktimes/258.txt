“My name is Naomi and
I’m 11 years old.
I represent the
African-American women who
are victims of gun violence.
I’m here to say, 'Never
again,' for those girls, too.”
“Never again! Never again!”
“Never did I think I
would be herded like cattle
by a shower of bullets
that left me scarred and rattled.”
“My brother, he was
in high school when
he passed away.
You hear pops thinking
they’re fireworks.
They weren’t pops.”
My nephew, Daishawn Moore —
he was taken away on May 28, in the year of 2017,
two weeks after his 16th birthday.
And to the politicians that believe that their right to
own a gun comes before our lives:
Get ready to get
voted out by us,
the future.”
“In the wake of the
tragedy on February 14th,
we as students, as youths, decided that if adults
weren’t going to take action,
we would.
When Joan of Arc fought
back English forces,
she was 17 years old; when
Mozart wrote his first symphony,
he was 8 years old.
To those people that
tell us that teenagers
can’t do anything,
I say that we were the
only people that could have
made this movement possible.”
“We will not stop until every
man, every woman, every child
and every American can live
without fear of gun violence
and to that I say, 'No more.'
We can and we will change the world!”
“Today is just the beginning.
Parkland and the rest of the world
have been sprinting.
But these sprints are just warm-up laps.
As of now, we have officially started
our marathon
that will last until we make a change
for safer gun policies.”
"Save our kids, save our kids."
"Hey hey, ho ho, the N.R.A. has got to go."
