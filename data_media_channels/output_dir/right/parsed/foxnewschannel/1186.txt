>> Martha: ALL RIGHT.
DRUM ROLL PLEASE.
HOURS FROM NOW THE VOTERS
START HEADING TO THE POLLS IN
EIGHT STATES IN UNITED STATES
OF AMERICA.
INCLUDING CALIFORNIA.
WHICH POLITICAL WATCHERS
BELIEVE COULD DETERMINE THE
CONTROL OF THE HOUSE COME
NOVEMBER BECAUSE THERE IS SO
MANY INTERESTING RACES GOING
ON IN CALIFORNIA.
SO UNDER THE STATE'S RULES,
THE TOP TWO CANDIDATES ADVANCE
TO THE GENERAL ELECTION
REGARDLESS OF PARTY.
MEANING BOTH DEMOCRATS AND
REPUBLICANS COULD BE SHUT OUT
OF KEY CONTESTS.
KAYLEIGH McENANY IS THE
R.N.C. SPOKESPERSON.
GOOD TO SEE YOU TONIGHT.
THERE IS SO MUCH GOING ON IN
ALL OF THE STATES ACROSS THE
COUNTRY.
CALIFORNIA'S FASCINATING.
TELL ME WHAT YOU ARE WATCHING
THERE.
>> YOU ARE RIGHT.
THIS IS A FASCINATING STATE TO
LOOK AT.
AS YOU MENTION THIS IS A TOP
TWO VOTE-GETTER SYSTEM.
SO IN THREE CONGRESSIONAL
DISTRICTS THERE ARE SO MANY
DEMOCRATIC CANDIDATES VYING TO
BECOME THEIR NOMINEE OR TO
ADVANCE IN THE TOP TWO
VOTE-GETTER ROUND THAT
BASICALLY THEY COULD BE SHUT
OUT AND WE COULD SEE
REPUBLICANS WITH A SMALLER
FIELD ADVANCE.
WHAT IS ASTOMP NICHING TO
ME -- ASTOMP NICHING TO ME IS
THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY IS
GETTING INVOLVED IN BULLYING
THE CANDIDATES OUT OF THE
RACE.
YOU HAVE ONE DEMOCRATIC
CANDIDATE IN THE 48th
DISTRICT SAYING THE PARTY
OFFICIALS CAME TO ME AND SAID
I WAS TOO BROWN TO WIN HERE
AND I HAD TO LEAVE THE RACE.
THIS IS ASTONISHING THEY ARE
SINKING TO THAT LOW.
>> WHO IS THAT?
>> CONGRESSMAN OMAR SIDIQUE,
THE FORMER ADVISER ALLEGING
THIS AGAINST THE OFFICIALS IN
THE 48th DISTRICT.
>> Martha: WHAT IS HE DOING
ABOUT THAT?
IS HE FIGHTING THAT?
THAT IS UNBELIEVABLE.
>> HE HAS BEEN SAYING IT
LOUDLY.
IT'S ONLY PICKED UP BY ONE
SOURCE, THE WASHINGTON
EXAMINER BUT I CONFIRMED WITH
THE R.N.C. HE IS SAYING THE
DEMOCRATIC PARTY OFFICIALS
TOLD HIM THIS.
NO ONE IS COVERING THIS.
THEY ARE USING RACE-BAITING
AND TACTICS TO BULLY OUT
CANDIDATES.
IT'S ASTONISHING.
>> Martha: IT IS
ASTONISHING.
WHAT ABOUT THE REPRESENTATIVE
ED ROYCE'S SEAT WHICH IS OPEN.
THAT IS CALLED THE WEIRDEST
RACE IN THE COUNTRY.
WHY?
>> IT'S VERY WEIRD.
YOU HAVE THE DEMOCRATS
FIGHTING SO INTENSELY THAT THE
STATE PARTY CHAIRMAN, THE
DEMOCRATIC STATE PARTY
CHAIRMAN CONVENED THEM AT AN
ITALIAN RESTAURANT.
IN WHAT WAS DESCRIBED AS A,
"GODFATHER LIKE DINNER" SAYING
WE ALL NEED TO COME TOGETHER
AND MAKE PEACE BECAUSE WE ARE
HURTING OURSELVES.
THIS IS HOW VICIOUS IT'S
GOTTEN.
THEY ARE CONVENING AT ITALIAN
RESTAURANTS TO MAKE PEACE.
>> Martha: WE HOPE IT
DOESN'T TURN OUT LIKE "THE
GODFATHER."
IN TERMS OF THE MONEY SPENT BY
THE DEMOCRATS, YOU KNOW, THEY
ARE IN DANGER OF GOING BUST IN
CALIFORNIA THEY DUMPED SO MUCH
MONEY IN THIS.
RIGHT?
>> RIGHT.
THERE ARE SEN TEATS THEY SPENT
COMBINED $30 MILLION -- TEN
SEATS THAT THEY HAVE SPENT
COMBINED $30 MILLION.
WE HAVE ONLY SPENT A FRACTION
OF THAT.
OUR CANDIDATES ARE EQUIPPED
WITH MILLIONS OF DOLLARS WHEN
THEY COME OUT OF THE RACES BUT
TO AVOID THE TOP TWO VOTE
GETTER SYSTEM, THE DEMOCRATS
ARE WASTING THE MONEY AND SOME
OF THEIR CANDIDATES ARE NEXT
TO BROKE.
THEY HAVE A LOT OF TROUBLE.
D.M.C. IS BROKE, TOO.
>> Martha: WHAT ABOUT
HOLDING ON TO THE REPUBLICAN
SEATS CALIFORNIA?
>> SOMETHING WE ARE LOOKING AT
IS THE SANCTUARY STATE LAW
THAT HAS REALLY TAKEN
CALIFORNIA BY STORM.
YOU SEE MORE THAN A DOZEN
DISTRICTS RISING UP AGAINST
THE STATE DISTRICT SAYING THIS
IS NOT SOMETHING WE WANT TO
TOLERATE.
THIS IS A KEY HOT BUTTON ISSUE
FOR US.
WE HAVE SEEN KEVIN DALIEONE
WHO IS RUNNING AGAINST DIANNE
FEINSTEIN.
HE HAS FALLEN IN THE POLL AND
THAT IS ILLUSTRATIVE OF WHAT
IS HAPPENING STATE WIDE.
>> Martha: IT'S GOING TO BE
FASCINATING.
WHAT ABOUT MONTANA?
WE REMEMBER THE PRESIDENT
GOING AFTER THE SENATOR TESTRA
THERE, AND THEY WANTED HIM TO
BE THE HEAD OF THE P.A.
WHAT IS GOING ON THERE?
>> IT'S INTERESTING BECAUSE
JOHN TESTER VOTED AGAINST
NEARLY ALL OF PRESIDENT
TRUMP'S POLICIES.
CAN PUT ON TWO HANDS THE
NUMBER OF BILLS I GOT
PRESIDENT TRUMP TO SIGN."
HE WASN'T WITH PRESIDENT TRUMP
ON TAX CUTS.
WASN'T WITH PRESIDENT TRUMP ON
KEEPING THE GOVERNMENT OPEN OR
ANY OF THE OTHER KEY
LEGISLATION.
HE HAS A GREEN PARTY CHALLENGE
AND HE IS FIGHTING THAT IN
