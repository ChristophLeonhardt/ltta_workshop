pledge to join the movement and hashtag be inconvenient go to inconvenience equal com slash action to be part of the solution a new viral video online shows a cop pointing a gun at a couple after a routine traffic stop the couple was apparently speeding and then they were questioning why it is that the police officer was holding a gun to them after he had requested registration so this stop took place on July 26 after an officer noticed a car pass him going 85 miles per hour and that's according to the Campbell Police Department in California after stopping the car for speeding the officer requested the driver's license and additional paperwork the driver and passenger spent several minutes looking for the paperwork before the officer walked back to his motorcycle to write a citation now so far both parties are in agreement over what happened but then all of a sudden there's massive disagreement especially when it comes to the fact that the officer pulled a gun on the the people in the car now we're gonna show you the video that went viral it's not the full nine minute video but it'll give you a sense of what the scene was like and and how scary it was to be honest with you take a quick look don't move alright why I understand that don't move wearing that gun at me bro do not move it right now but why are you still playing the gun at me though not moving right now regardless is why he's still pointing the gun at me bro my hands are right here I understand that no you don't understand you still got the gun point at me bro no I'm not gonna be that get the gun off me serious right now is that really necessary it is right now okay hands are both out tonight formation serious right now bro god help me bro right back up to be here we'll be back up for what and you just keep pointing at me bro yeah my guns out of that holster escorted out here right now why why is it ever is on my floor there's nothing on my floor that he reached for do you have for registration ok so 9 minutes he pointed a gun at him you know what that reminded me of immediately I thought a Philander Casteel I know and and luckily in this case he wasn't black well no one got killed in this situation so look there's a lot of factors okay and yes one of them could be race but let's talk about the the more the bigger factor okay the bigger factor is as we've told you a million times cops are told anything anything's a danger everybody's got a gun well that part is true so by the way we should think about that right and you wonder why cops are so nervous cuz there's over two hundred and fifty million guns in the country okay and they're taught okay if they reach anywhere but their registrations in the glove compartment or maybe it fell next to their seat I remember when I was growing up in America and you could reach to get your registration and you wouldn't have a gun pulled on you now it's gotten worse Oh pulled a gun pulled a gun pulled again and look if I have a cop pull a gun on me do you have any idea how nervous I am be anything you should be enormous let's does n't matter what you look like because if they think you're even twitching in the wrong direction that's it you're dead and you say oh and in one and part of this story in The Washington Post they're like even if like the I the guy was understandably nervous even though it was a police officer even though okay I mean are you have you not watched the news at all and like again it's the training so I'm more nervous with a cop because a random person even if they're a criminal was not told that at any minute someone can shoot you and you should never ever take a risk and you should just put someone down immediately whereas we trained our cops to do that so that's why oh you reach for something inside how could you not reach for something inside a car how do you get your registration without reaching like you can't put your hands up you can't put them down and you think we shouldn't be nervous that the cops are gonna shoot us that guy was understandably angry and very worried he should have been very worried okay so what I found interesting was the police department's reaction to this video they claimed that the situation ended in an amicable manner and they say we understand that it's never a comfortable position to have a gun pointed at you oh yeah regardless of whether it's a police officer unfortunately the length of time that the officer's gun was drawn lasted much longer than normal based on his location but they claimed all right after that happened though they had a talk and the the man in the video who was upset at the gun pointed at him even apologized to cops but it seems like that perspective what wasn't accurate because that video was posted online by the man in the video who had the gun pointed at him and he didn't have nice things to say about the cops which means that it didn't end amicably but the reaction to the video is what I think should be concerning as well because while people defended you know the man who was understandably upset there were also individuals who were like well you shouldn't have been talking to the cop that way look you guys have to understand when cops are justified in pulling their weapons and shooting their weapons it's when an individual is an imminent threat when their lives are in danger you can curse at a police officer guess what that's actually protected by our First Amendment okay that is a person who is paid by taxpayer money he is a public official and so you are allowed to say negative things to cops they're not allowed to shoot you or pull out their gun as a result of you saying things that are critical of them or you know that you might not like it's the justifications that's what that's what gets to me really you think it's okay for a gun cop to pull out a gun or potentially shoot someone because they said something negative to the cop so it used to be that a cop would pull out a gun and say stop you're under arrest freeze all that stuff and we're only fire if his he was his life was in real danger then it became if you're in danger of getting hurt you know then then you could pull your gun or shoot your gun now it's gotten to the point if your feelings are in danger of getting hurt then you can you pull the gun right so now look I know what they'll say they'll say no he was reaching down again I don't know where you can reach inside a car where cop wouldn't pull a gun on you right so in and part of the reason that they trained that way is if they talk back to you that it's gonna lead to chaos and you got to show them who's boss and you're gonna establish order right away yeah sometimes that makes sense if you've got a situation that's actually out of hand and it is headed down the wrong direction I and I think cops have to be pleasant everyone of course there's a situation where you yell at him or you arrest them we have to take physical action and yes there are situations where you have to pull a gun but they should be extreme they shouldn't mean regular course of hawala you said something I didn't like talking back to a cop is not an offense you should get executed for and once he pulls that gun if anything goes wrong you die if he perceives your hands to be going too far low or too far high you die and you've got people out there going well you shouldn't talk back to the cop are you insane that's now a death-penalty offense in America
