Senator Richard Blumenthal was on TV and he was talking about the Russian investigation and of course trump was beside himself with anger turns out the Trump was watching TV no first let me show you what Blumenthal said the Russia investigation in Panama the grand jury shows that Bob Muller is pursuing this potential wrongdoing by the Russians the attack on our democracy seriously and diligently and there is no minimizing or under estimating that attack by the Russians it was purposeful and relentless and it involved propaganda and hacking into our voting machines or at least an attempt to do it and potential collusion by the Trump campaign and then obstruction of justice that investigation must be pursued now it's a very normal thing to say on cable news they talk about Russia all the time you thought about Muller's do any of us he makes sense right and he's a Democratic senator so nothing here is surprising but Trump of course can't stand any criticism John Kelly's she was that was supposed to get him under control and under control so he grabs a Twitter machine starts to tweet out and so he says this interesting to watch Senator Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut talking about hoaxes Russian collusion when he was a phony Vietnam con artist now wait a minute I'm gonna get into his Vietnam record in a second but what does that have to do anything with the Russian investigation nothing at all just back to bully Donald Trump oh yeah lying Ted the crooked Hillary George Blumenthal didn't go to right so he continues never in US history has anyone lied or defrauded voters like Senator Richard Blumenthal well there might be one exception just look up look at that picture up there anyway he told stories about he says about his Vietnam battles and conquests how brave he was and it was all a lie he cried like a baby and beg for forgiveness like a child now he judges collusion again collusion in Vietnam have nothing new we want another a second important like a baby and is the president the president say these outrageous and same things accusing senators of crying like babies all right let's hear the truth now now roster explains well Blumenthal has publicly apologized for claiming that he served in Vietnam he did actually enlist in the United States Marine Corps Reserve where he served from 1970 to 1976 so you look you want to blame Blumenthal for being a cheesy politician who lied about actually going to be now fine but he is definitely a veteran he's a marine and and no one disputes that okay so now let's do first thing let's turn to Trump's military record find out what happened there Trump meanwhile was ranted for deferments on the draft while he was studying at Fordham University and the University of Pennsylvania and then was subsequently medically disqualified during Armed Forces physical examination for supposed bone spurs in his feet although no records exist to verify this claim and of course he famously during the campaign when asked which foot had a bone sport couldn't remember and said maybe both have no bones Bern hey want to go to Vietnam now he criticized his actual veterans so veterans on Twitter stepped in it quite enraged about this you have some fun tweets Robert googly Lemmy says you mr. president have absolutely no right to criticize anyone who served won't be silenced as drafted draft dodger says what vets against Trump says 5 draft deferments using your wealth and privilege to avoid fighting while others less elite were drafted hashtag bets against Trump and then Tully mocks was a little bit more blunt I'm a veteran you chickenhawk piece of trash you have no room to talk the only service you had was avoiding STDs if you were wondering what they referring to there well I have the quotes for you so when talking to Howard Stern throughout the years Donald Trump has said you know if you're young and in this year and if you have any guilt about not having gone to Vietnam we have our own Vietnam it's called the dating game dating is like being in Vietnam you're the equivalent of a soldier going over to Vietnam because he was worried about the STDs while dating now I'm I didn't go to Vietnam I'm too young and I don't make claims about whether I would have gone or not gone etc I have the decency to not insult the veterans who went to Vietnam now whether it was a war that was wrong or not they went they risked their lives they went through hell there and this guy flippantly talks about I mean when I was dating all those women because I'm really rich avoiding the sexually transmitted diseases was like going to Vietnam no it wasn't I could assure you it really really wasn't he's not done he had one more quote on that he said it's amazing about again avoiding STDs I can't even believe it I've been so lucky in terms of that whole world it is a dangerous world out there it's like Vietnam sort of it's my personal Vietnam I feel like a great and very brave soldier so that's Donald Trump and his service to the country and he has the temerity to attack a guy who served as a marine for six years and now when people called him out they stopped watching TV and sending these insane tweets he then tweets the White House is functioning perfectly focus on health care tax cuts to reform and many other things I have very little time for watching TV okay are you ready for this John Berman from CNN said for what it's worth we were talking about this subject on TV just before the tweet in other words he watches them talking on TV about how he watches too much TV and says it's we'd immediately go Akana watching TV that guy is a pathological liar and in his own words sad baby if you like this video you probably like independent media the best way to support independent
