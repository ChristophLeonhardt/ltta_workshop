1
00:00:03,248 --> 00:00:05,570
The watch comes in two different versions,

2
00:00:05,570 --> 00:00:07,650
and the difference between the
two is pretty much restricted

3
00:00:07,650 --> 00:00:09,440
just to the case material.

4
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:12,780
The $460,000 version is in red gold,

5
00:00:12,780 --> 00:00:13,613
and the more expensive

6
00:00:13,613 --> 00:00:15,238
half million dollar version

7
00:00:15,245 --> 00:00:16,851
is done in platinum.

8
00:00:20,650 --> 00:00:23,570
Many of the most expensive
watches are expensive because

9
00:00:23,570 --> 00:00:25,170
they're set with precious stones, which,

10
00:00:25,170 --> 00:00:27,170
of course, raises the
price through the roof.

11
00:00:27,170 --> 00:00:29,370
In the case of the
Récital 22 Grand Récital,

12
00:00:29,370 --> 00:00:32,720
however, the watch is as
expensive as it is entirely

13
00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:34,750
because of the amount of
craftsmanship that goes into it

14
00:00:34,750 --> 00:00:36,030
and the length of time that it takes

15
00:00:36,030 --> 00:00:36,863
to produce the various effects

16
00:00:36,863 --> 00:00:39,188
that make the watch what it is.

17
00:00:40,270 --> 00:00:42,740
BOVET watches are inherently
limited in production simply

18
00:00:42,740 --> 00:00:44,580
because of the complexity
that's associated

19
00:00:44,580 --> 00:00:45,600
with making them.

20
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:48,460
This particular watch is a limited edition

21
00:00:48,460 --> 00:00:50,810
of 60 pieces worldwide.

22
00:00:50,810 --> 00:00:54,080
Those are going to roll out
very slowly, simply because

23
00:00:54,080 --> 00:00:55,100
they can't be made quickly.

24
00:00:55,100 --> 00:00:58,290
It's just inherent in
the nature of the watch.

25
00:00:58,290 --> 00:01:00,470
The single decorative
element that's probably

26
00:01:00,470 --> 00:01:03,520
most strongly identified
with BOVET today is the use

27
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:07,650
of extremely fine miniature
painting, often in the form of,

28
00:01:07,650 --> 00:01:10,920
what's called, cold enameling
on the dials of their watches.

29
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:14,700
And the Récital 22 Grand Récital has a

30
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:18,070
really, really wonderful example
of this particular craft.

31
00:01:18,070 --> 00:01:20,730
The centerpiece of the
watch is a hemisphere

32
00:01:20,730 --> 00:01:23,920
representing the Earth as seen
from above the North Pole.

33
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:26,130
There are many, many layers
of enamel that have been,

34
00:01:26,130 --> 00:01:27,890
that have been applied to
the hemisphere in order

35
00:01:27,890 --> 00:01:30,400
to achieve a wonderful
kind of translucent effect

36
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:32,300
in which the clouds
literally seem to float

37
00:01:32,300 --> 00:01:34,350
above the oceans and continents.

38
00:01:34,350 --> 00:01:38,430
The paints are actually luminous
and very, very luminous,

39
00:01:38,430 --> 00:01:41,320
and, when you turn the lights
off, you are treated to a view

40
00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:43,000
of the continents glowing up at you

41
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,130
that's just incredibly compelling.

42
00:01:45,130 --> 00:01:47,770
This particular wristwatch
is in a class of,

43
00:01:47,770 --> 00:01:50,260
what are called,
astronomical complications.

44
00:01:50,260 --> 00:01:53,580
These are timepieces that show,
often, the relative position

45
00:01:53,580 --> 00:01:55,870
of the stars to an observer
standing on Earth, or,

46
00:01:55,870 --> 00:01:57,640
in this case, the relative position

47
00:01:57,640 --> 00:01:58,910
of the sun and the moon relative

48
00:01:58,910 --> 00:02:00,610
to an observer standing on Earth.

49
00:02:00,610 --> 00:02:03,710
So the centerpiece is this
revolving hand-painted depiction

50
00:02:03,710 --> 00:02:06,320
of the upper hemisphere,
the northern hemisphere

51
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:07,500
of the Earth.

52
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:10,199
Placed just below it, in the
six o'clock position, is,

53
00:02:10,199 --> 00:02:11,750
what's called, a tourbillon.

54
00:02:11,750 --> 00:02:14,880
We can see the tourbillon
rotating as we look at the watch,

55
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:17,530
and the position that it's in
is identical to the position

56
00:02:17,530 --> 00:02:19,950
that the sun would be in,
relative to the Earth.

57
00:02:19,950 --> 00:02:22,140
So it kind of stands in for,
the tourbillon stands in

58
00:02:22,140 --> 00:02:23,950
for the sun in this wristwatch.

59
00:02:23,950 --> 00:02:26,650
Rotating around the Earth
is a spherical depiction

60
00:02:26,650 --> 00:02:30,020
of the moon divided
into a sunlit hemisphere

61
00:02:30,020 --> 00:02:31,500
and a dark hemisphere.

62
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:34,080
And you can read the phase
of the moon from the position

63
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:36,750
of this little hemisphere as
it rotates around the Earth.

64
00:02:36,750 --> 00:02:39,200
The back of the watch is
also loaded with information.

65
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:41,190
It's what's called the perpetual calendar.

66
00:02:41,190 --> 00:02:43,940
Now, a perpetual calendar
is a mechanical watch

67
00:02:43,940 --> 00:02:46,540
which knows the difference
between a leap year

68
00:02:46,540 --> 00:02:49,010
and a non-leap year, and
which also advances the date

69
00:02:49,010 --> 00:02:50,530
correctly at the end of each month,

70
00:02:50,530 --> 00:02:53,540
whether it's a 30-day
month or a 31-day month.

71
00:02:53,540 --> 00:02:55,970
The relative rarity of
the watches and the amount

72
00:02:55,970 --> 00:02:58,580
of handwork that goes into
finishing the movement, the case,

73
00:02:58,580 --> 00:03:01,230
and other aspects of the watch all adds up

74
00:03:01,230 --> 00:03:02,730
to a tremendous, tremendous amount

75
00:03:02,730 --> 00:03:04,500
of real old-school craftsmanship,

76
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:05,990
which simply doesn't come cheap.

77
00:03:05,990 --> 00:03:08,940
At this level of watchmaking,
you're really talking about

78
00:03:08,940 --> 00:03:10,570
something that's designed
to appeal to someone

79
00:03:10,570 --> 00:03:13,603
with extremely specific tastes
and with a budget to match.

80
00:03:15,520 --> 00:00:00,000
There are 705 components
in this wristwatch.
