TRULY SAD MOMENT IN HISTORY.
JOHN ROBERTS.
THANK YOU.
>> Bill: BACK TO ALAN
DERSHOWITZ.
THE WORLD OF CABLE NEWS AND YOU
ARE WELCOME TO COMMENT.
THIS IS WHAT WE DO.
WHEN JOHN ROBERTS JUST SAID
THIS IS THE ART OF THE DEAL YOU
SAT THEIR SHAKING YOUR HEAD.
>> ABSOLUTELY.
THIS IS PLAYING INTO DONALD
TRUMP'S STRONG SUITE.
HE KNOWS HOW TO MAKE A DEAL.
HE KNOWS HOW TO WALK AWAY FROM
THE TABLE AND OFFER TO COME
BACK TO THE TABLE.
I'M CERTAINLY NOT GOING TO
SECOND GUESS OUR PRESIDENT WHEN
IT COMES TO NEGOTIATING WITH
NORTH KOREA.
I DON'T THINK HE HAD ANY CHOICE.
ONCE HE HEARD WHAT -- I THINK
ONCE HE HEARD WHAT THE  LEADER
OF NORTH KOREA WHAT HE SAID
ABOUT THE VICE PRESIDENT AND
OUR COUNTRY.
HE WALKED AWAY IN A CONDITIONAL
SENSE.
HE SAID I WELCOME YOU TO COME
BACK BUT ON MY TERMS.
REMEMBER, WE HAVE MOST OF THE
CARDS IN THIS NEGOTIATION.
AND I THINK THE PRESIDENT IS
PLAYING THEM WELL.
>> Bill: THE KEY LINE HERE,
SADLY BASED ON THE ANGER AND
HOSTILITY IN YOUR MOST RECENT
STATEMENT I FEEL IT'S
INAPPROPRIATE AT THIS TIME TO
HAVE THIS LONG-PLANNED MEETING.
WHAT HAS HAPPENED WITH THE
PRESIDENT IN THE LAST WEEK HE
HAS CHARACTERIZED THIS AS A
VICTORY FOR NORTH KOREA AND
CHARACTERIZED IT AS A VICTORY
FOR THE WORLD AND THE WAY HE IS
TRYING TO SELL THIS TO KIM.
I DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY'RE
HEARING FROM OUR LEADERS.
BUT THERE IS A LOT THEY DON'T
LIKE.
IN THAT SENSE THAT'S THEIR ART
OF THE DEAL.
>> NO QUESTION BOTH SIDES ARE
NEGOTIATING AT THIS POINT.
WHETHER THIS ENDS UP WITH A
MEETING OR NOT, I DON'T THINK
ANYBODY CAN KNOW.
BUT WE CAN'T HAVE OUR PRESIDENT
MEET WITH SOMEBODY WHO SAID THE
KINDS OF THINGS HE HAS SAID AND
THREATENED THE UNITED STATES
WITH NUCLEAR WEAPONS.
I THINK THERE HAS TO BE ATONING
DOWN OF THE RHETORIC ON THEIR
SIDE BEFORE A PRODUCTIVE
MEETING.
>> Bill: IN YOUR LAW AND YOUR
WORLD YOU LOOK FOR GOOD FAITH
AND BAD FAITH.
BAD FAITH TAKES YOU DOWN A BAD
ROAD.
GOOD FAITH, HOWEVER, DOES NOT.
YOU HAVE THE RELEASE OF THESE
THREE AMERICANS.
THAT WAS A GOOD FAITH GESTURE.
MIKE POMPEO INVITED TO
PYONGYANG TWICE IN A MONTH IS A
GOOD FAITH GESTURE.
WHETHER YOU BELIEVE THEIR
NUCLEAR PROGRAM HAS CRIPPLED OR
NOT THEY STILL HAD THE
IMPLOSION OF THE MOUNTAIN
EARLIER TODAY.
THAT IS A GOOD FAITH GESTURE.
WHAT'S THE PROBLEM?
>> WHEN ROBERT KENNEDY HAD TO
NEGOTIATE WITH THE SOVIET UNION
OVER CUBA HE SAID DON'T LISTEN
TO WHAT THEY SAY BUT WHAT THEY
DO.
WHAT THEY'VE DONE IN NORTH
RELEASE OF THE HOSTAGES.
WHAT THEY'VE SAID IS TERRIBLE.
WE HAVE A PRESIDENT SAYING IN
RESPONSE TO THEIR SAYING BUT
STILL KEEPING OPEN THE OPTION
OF HAVING THE MEETING.
SO IF I HAVE TO MAKE A
LONG-TERM PREDICTION I PREDICT
WE HAVE THE MEETING AND
SOMEWHAT BETTER TERMS.
>> Bill: BETTER TERMS.
UNDECLARED AT THIS POINT.
>> THERE IS PROBABLY A LOT OF
STUFF GOING ON BEHIND THE
SCENES.
>> Bill: I AGREE WITH CHINA AND
THE MOVE YESTERDAY IN THE SOUTH
CHINA SEA WHEN THE UNITED
STATES DISINVITED THE CHINESE
FROM MILITARY MANEUVERS.
>> AND CONSIDER THE IRAN DEAL.
WHEN HE SAYS SOMETHING, HE
MEANS IT WHEN HE PULLED OUT OF
THE IRAN DEAL.
HE IS READY TO RENEGOTIATE THE
IRAN DEAL.
THESE ARE SOMEWHAT SIMILAR IN
MANY RESPECTS.
>> Bill: LAST POINT.
THE LAST MISSILE TEST THE NORTH
KOREANS CONDUCTED WAS IN
NOVEMBER OF 2017.
IN MY ESTIMATION THAT'S THE
MOST CRITICAL ASPECT TO WATCH
RIGHT NOW.
THERE MAY NOT BE ANOTHER
UNDERGROUND NUCLEAR TEST BUT
THEY SEEM TO HAVE AN ABILITY TO
FIRE OFF A MISSILE OR TEST A
ROCKET AT A TIME OF THEIR
CHOOSING.
IF PRESIDENT TRUMP CAN SHOW THE
AMERICAN PEOPLE AND THE WORLD
THAT NORTH KOREAN SITUATION IS
STABILIZED, I THINK THAT'S THE
WAY YOU DO IT.
IF THERE IS NO MORE TESTING,
THAT'S THE SIGNAL TO CHINA, TO
THE AMERICAN PEOPLE, WITH THE
MID-TERM ELECTION SIX MONTHS
AWAY WE HAVE THE SITUATION
RIGHT NOW STILL UNDER CONTROL
DESPITE THE NEWS.
>> I AGREE WITH THAT.
IT IS THE MISSILE THAT IS
INCOMPLETE IN THEIR INVENTORY.
THEY HAVEN'T YET SHOWN THE
WORLD THAT THEY CAN SEND A
MISSILE TO THE SHORES OF THE
UNITED STATES.
THEY ALREADY HAVE DEVELOPED
THEIR NUCLEAR WEAPON.
THEY DON'T NEED TO TEST THE
NUCLEAR WEAPON AS MUCH AS THEY
