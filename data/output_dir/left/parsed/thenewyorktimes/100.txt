“I’ve seen the soldiers and
the trucks of the soldiers —
they’re holding guns.”
It wasn’t supposed
to be like this.
“People have been
beaten by the soldiers.
Some of our guys 
have been killed.”
This was supposed to be
the moment that
proved that Zimbabwe
was moving on
from its oppressive past.
Instead, city streets
look like this,
with soldiers opening
fire on protesters
and leaving at least three
people dead only days
after an election.
“It’s not safe, it’s not safe —
the soldiers, they are
coming, that side.”
Reporter: “O.K.
Oh, we should go? Let’s go.”
So what happened?
Here’s what we saw.
This is Harare, the
capital, two days earlier.
Polls are about to open, but
the lines are already long.
Voters are
peaceful and excited.
“I woke up 
early in the morning.
I didn’t have time 
to bathe today
because I was really eager
to come and vote.”
This is the first
election in decades
without the name of
Zimbabwe’s longtime leader,
Robert Mugabe, on the ballot.
A military coup 
in November
forced Mugabe out,
raising hopes that the system
he put in place would
also go away.
For a while, violence subsided,
and people 
talked more openly,
allowing someone like Vincent
to show his support
for the opposition.
“People were not free to
express our feelings,
like we are doing right now.
So now voting is something
that we are doing willingly.
Today I’ve exercised my right.
I’m very happy.”
We drive east, 
away from the city.
We see fewer signs of
support for the opposition.
Rural areas are
traditional strongholds
for the ruling party,
mostly because
of years of intimidation
and vote rigging.
We saw people walk miles to
reach their polling centers.
Unlike in
previous elections,
this time the ruling party
promised transparency.
And to convince the world, 
Emmerson Mnangagwa,
the ruling party candidate
who replaced Mugabe 
after the coup,
invited international observers.
But in these
rural villages, we didn’t
see any of those observers.
Instead, we saw this:
This man is camped outside a
polling station, writing down
the names of everyone
coming to vote.
It’s an old strategy
that could mean
food and fertilizer
for those on his list
or retribution for
those who are not.
His name is Norman.
When confronted, he
shows us his list
and quickly starts
to explain that he’s
part of a larger group,
mobilized by the ruling party,
spread across
multiple villages.
Police and election officials watch.
“So this is the complaint.”
They don’t try to
stop him, but they
ask us to stop shooting.
"Off the camera,
yes we can talk —
off the camera.”
Reporter: “We’ll turn it off.”
It’s the next day 
and markets reopen,
while people wait
for official results.
But they don’t come.
Optimism turns to unease,
with growing concerns
that the vote count
will not be fair.
In a preemptive move,
Nelson Chamisa, the leading
opposition candidate
takes to social media
and claims victory.
Hours later, he
deletes this tweet.
But it’s too late.
Hundreds of his supporters
take to the streets
to celebrate in front of the
party headquarters.
Wednesday morning,
still no winner.
In the meantime,
officials announce
a sweeping parliamentary
victory for the ruling party
and international observers
release statements
criticizing the election.
Protests form, peaceful at first.
But quickly escalate.
Soldiers and army tanks deploy,
hunting down 
opposition supporters.
In just over 48 hours,
we watched as a hopeful
city was overtaken by fear
and now is bracing for
the announcement
of who the next president
will be.
