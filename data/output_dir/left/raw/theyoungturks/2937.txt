1
00:00:00,070 --> 00:00:04,360
>>DONALD TRUMP IS A
MEGALOMANIAC AND BELIEVES THAT

2
00:00:04,360 --> 00:00:09,760
HE SHOULD GET CREDIT FOR THINGS
AS TRIVIAL AS THE WORD FAKE, HE

3
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:12,040
LITERALLY SAID IN AN INTERVIEW
ONCE THAT HE INVENTED THE WORD

4
00:00:12,040 --> 00:00:17,640
FAKE, HE SAID IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN
AROUND BEFORE BUT I MADE IT

5
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:18,710
POPULAR.

6
00:00:18,710 --> 00:00:21,750
NOW HE IS TAKING CREDIT
FOR CHRISTMAS.

7
00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:22,750
HE LAUNCHED A

8
00:00:22,750 --> 00:00:27,470
NUMBER OF TWEETS ALL WITH BIG,
BOLD LETTERS, SAYING MERRY

9
00:00:27,470 --> 00:00:28,470
CHRISTMAS!

10
00:00:28,470 --> 00:00:30,999
FIRST OF ALL, GOD
BLESS, THAT'S FANTASTIC, BLESS

11
00:00:30,999 --> 00:00:32,870
YOUR HEART, DO 17 OF THOSE.

12
00:00:32,870 --> 00:00:36,460
SO
FAR SO GOOD, THAT'S FINE.

13
00:00:36,460 --> 00:00:37,460
YOU

14
00:00:37,460 --> 00:00:41,770
KNOW THIS WILL TURN INTO THE WAR
ON CHRISTMAS SPIEL THAT O'REILLY

15
00:00:41,770 --> 00:00:45,870
AND FOX NEWS STARTED AND OF
COURSE TRUMP IS JUMPING IN ON,

16
00:00:45,870 --> 00:00:49,320
BUT THAT'S ALL RIGHT, LET'S GO
TO THE VIDEO OF HIM TALKING

17
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:50,820
ABOUT CHRISTMAS AS WELL.

18
00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:54,539
>>I WANTED TO WISH EVERYBODY A
VERY MERRY CHRISTMAS.

19
00:00:54,539 --> 00:00:58,410
>>VERY MERRY CHRISTMAS, OKAY,
WE GOT IT.

20
00:00:58,410 --> 00:00:59,570
HOW ABOUT ONE MORE?

21
00:00:59,570 --> 00:01:03,699
>>WE SAY CHRISTMAS AGAIN VERY
PROUDLY, VERY, VERY MERRY

22
00:01:03,699 --> 00:01:04,699
CHRISTMAS.

23
00:01:04,699 --> 00:01:08,480
>>VERY, VERY, MERRY, MERRY
CHRISTMAS TO ALL OF YOU AND WE

24
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:11,750
SAY IT PROUDLY WEARS BEFORE WE
HUNG OUR HEAD IN SHAME AS WE

25
00:01:11,750 --> 00:01:14,360
SAID MERRY CHRISTMAS?

26
00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:16,030
I DON'T
REMEMBER THAT, NO ONE REMEMBERS

27
00:01:16,030 --> 00:01:18,670
THAT IN AMERICA, BUT
HE'S NOT DONE YET.

28
00:01:18,670 --> 00:01:26,439
HE GOES ON TO SAY IN A TWEET --

29
00:01:26,439 --> 00:01:33,250
>>LET ME SEE, ONE, TWO, THREE,
FOUR, FIVE, SIX OR SO

30
00:01:33,250 --> 00:01:41,210
EXCLAMATION POINTS, I DON'T HAVE
MY GLASSES ON -- SO, I THINK HE

31
00:01:41,210 --> 00:01:43,750
MAKES A GOOD POINT HERE AND I'M
CALLING FOR THE RELEASE OF ALL

32
00:01:43,750 --> 00:01:48,610
THE POWs FROM THE WAR ON
CHRISTMAS, ALL THE PEOPLE WHO

33
00:01:48,610 --> 00:01:52,259
NOT ONLY WERE IMPRISONED BY
OBAMA FOR SAYING MERRY CHRISTMAS

34
00:01:52,259 --> 00:01:56,740
BUT ALSO THOSE MISSING IN
ACTION, THOSE WHO SAID MERRY

35
00:01:56,740 --> 00:02:01,530
HOLIDAYS AS A HALFWAY POINT, OR
PERHAPS HAPPY CHRISTMAS.

36
00:02:01,530 --> 00:02:02,530
WHERE

37
00:02:02,530 --> 00:02:03,530
ARE THEY?

38
00:02:03,530 --> 00:02:05,040
CAN WE FREE THEM AS
WELL?

39
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:06,040
IF YOU BELIEVE THERE WAS

40
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:12,440
AN ACTUAL WAR ON CHRISTMAS, YOU
VERGED ON BEING A LUNATIC.

41
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:14,840
PEOPLE KEPT SAYING MERRY
CHRISTMAS THROUGHOUT, NO ONE

42
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:17,230
MADE IT ILLEGAL TO SAY MERRY
CHRISTMAS, NO ONE EVEN THOUGHT

43
00:02:17,230 --> 00:02:20,750
IT WAS A BAD THING TO SAY MERRY
CHRISTMAS, NO PROGRESSIVE SAID

44
00:02:20,750 --> 00:02:24,130
THAT, FOX NEWS MADE IT UP
COMPLETELY.

45
00:02:24,130 --> 00:02:25,130
THE CONSERVATIVE

46
00:02:25,130 --> 00:02:28,170
STANCE OF FORCING PEOPLE TO SAY
MERRY CHRISTMAS FIRST OF ALL

47
00:02:28,170 --> 00:02:31,090
DOESN'T SEEM VERY MERRY, IT
DOESN'T SEEM LIKE IT FITS THE

48
00:02:31,090 --> 00:02:32,090
HOLIDAY SPIRIT.

49
00:02:32,090 --> 00:02:35,531
SECOND OF ALL IF
YOU ARE NOT CHRISTIAN, FOR

50
00:02:35,531 --> 00:02:37,500
EXAMPLE IF YOU ARE JEWISH AND
THEY KEEP FORCING YOU TO SAY

51
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:40,670
MERRY CHRISTMAS, OKAY, THAT
COULD BECOME PROBLEMATIC.

52
00:02:40,670 --> 00:02:41,670
I

53
00:02:41,670 --> 00:02:43,390
THINK A LOT OF PEOPLE SAID IT
ANYWAY BECAUSE PEOPLE AREN'T

54
00:02:43,390 --> 00:02:46,410
REALLY THAT OFFENDED BY IT.

55
00:02:46,410 --> 00:02:47,690
BUT
NONETHELESS IT TAKES ON A

56
00:02:47,690 --> 00:02:51,090
DIFFERENT RING OF ALL OF A
SUDDEN YOU GO FROM HEY, IT WOULD

57
00:02:51,090 --> 00:02:54,901
BE NICE IF PEOPLE SAID HAPPY
HOLIDAYS, MERRY CHRISTMAS, NO

58
00:02:54,901 --> 00:02:59,520
BIG DEAL, WHO CARES, TO WAIT A
MINUTE, YOU MUST SAY MERRY

59
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:00,520
CHRISTMAS.

60
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:04,810
THAT'S BIZARRE, AND
IT'S ALSO POLITICAL CORRECTNESS.

61
00:03:04,810 --> 00:03:07,300
IN FACT IT'S POLITICAL
CORRECTNESS 101.

62
00:03:07,300 --> 00:03:08,300
YOU AREN'T

63
00:03:08,300 --> 00:03:10,930
ALLOWED TO SAY THE THINGS YOU
NORMALLY SAY, YOU MUST SAY THE

64
00:03:10,930 --> 00:03:16,630
THINGS THAT ARE NOW POLITICALLY
CORRECT, LIKE MERRY CHRISTMAS.

65
00:03:16,630 --> 00:03:19,780
ONE THING WE KNOW, THOUGH, FROM
TRUMP'S CAMPAIGN IS THAT THE

66
00:03:19,780 --> 00:03:22,370
LAST EIGHT YEARS CHRISTMAS HAS
BEEN BANNED SO IT'S KIND OF

67
00:03:22,370 --> 00:03:27,210
WEIRD THAT THE OBAMAS ALSO PUT
OUT THIS TWEET, IT'S AS ON

68
00:03:27,210 --> 00:03:29,700
BEHALF OF THE OBAMA FAMILY,
MERRY CHRISTMAS.

69
00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:31,150
WAIT A MINUTE,

70
00:03:31,150 --> 00:03:32,350
WHAT IS GOING ON?

71
00:03:32,350 --> 00:03:33,530
AS HE TURNED
SIDES?

72
00:03:33,530 --> 00:03:36,950
AND HE SAYS WE WISH YOU

73
00:03:36,950 --> 00:03:39,820
JOY AND PEACE THIS HOLIDAY
SEASON, I WONDER WHAT HE MEANS

74
00:03:39,820 --> 00:03:44,760
BY THAT.

75
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:47,760
ONE THING THAT WILL
DRIVE TRUMP CRAZY IS OBAMA'S

76
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:52,750
TWEET SAYING MERRY CHRISTMAS GOT
AT LEAST SEVEN TIMES AS MUCH

77
00:03:52,750 --> 00:03:57,120
ATTENTION AND LIKES, ETC., AS
DID DONALD TRUMP'S, THAT WILL

78
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:58,840
GET UNDER HIS SKIN AND THAT'S
FUN.

79
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:00,370
IF YOU ARE WONDERING IF

80
00:04:00,370 --> 00:04:04,540
THIS IS A NEW TURN FOR OBAMA,
HE'S FINALLY SAYING MERRY

81
00:04:04,540 --> 00:04:08,400
CHRISTMAS BECAUSE OF DONALD
TRUMP, WELL, IF YOU THINK THAT

82
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:11,150
YOU HAVEN'T BEEN PAYING AN
INTENTION, OF COURSE IT'S NOT

83
00:04:11,150 --> 00:04:12,150
REMOTELY TRUE.

84
00:04:12,150 --> 00:04:14,180
I WANT TO GIVE
CREDIT TO DANIEL REDMOND WHO ON

85
00:04:14,180 --> 00:04:20,180
TWITTER PUT OUT A COMPILATION OF
PREVIOUS THINGS PRESIDENT

86
00:04:20,180 --> 00:04:22,330
OBAMA SAID IN OFFICE.

87
00:04:22,330 --> 00:04:24,100
>>HAVE A VERY MERRY CHRISTMAS.

88
00:04:24,100 --> 00:04:25,980
>>WE WANT TO SAY MERRY
CHRISTMAS.

89
00:04:25,980 --> 00:04:30,060
>>A VERY MERRY CHRISTMAS AND
HOLIDAY FILLED WITH JOY.

90
00:04:30,060 --> 00:04:34,070
>>I WANT TO WISH EVERY AMERICAN
A MERRY CHRISTMAS.

91
00:04:34,070 --> 00:04:36,600
>>MERRY CHRISTMAS, EVERYBODY.

92
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:38,280
>>MERRY CHRISTMAS!

93
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:40,810
>>MERRY CHRISTMAS, EVERYONE.

94
00:04:40,810 --> 00:04:43,340
>>MERRY CHRISTMAS, EVERYBODY.

95
00:04:43,340 --> 00:04:45,870
>>MERRY CHRISTMAS, EVERYBODY.

96
00:04:45,870 --> 00:04:48,400
>>MERRY CHRISTMAS, EVERYBODY.

97
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:50,090
>>MERRY CHRISTMAS.

98
00:04:50,090 --> 00:04:51,780
>>MERRY CHRISTMAS.

99
00:04:51,780 --> 00:04:54,880
>>CREDIT TO MSNBC AS WELL.

100
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:56,410
THAT
WAS AWESOME.

101
00:04:56,410 --> 00:04:57,410
IF YOU THOUGHT

102
00:04:57,410 --> 00:04:59,840
OBAMA DIDN'T SAY MERRY
CHRISTMAS, YOU ARE NOT ONLY

103
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:02,620
WRONG, YOU HAVE BEEN DUPED AS
USUAL.

104
00:05:02,620 --> 00:05:03,970
THERE HAS NEVER BEEN A

105
00:05:03,970 --> 00:05:07,040
WAR ON CHRISTMAS, IT'S
COMPLETELY INVENTED, AND ANYONE

106
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:10,430
WHO SAYS THAT IS REALLY KIND OF
PATHETIC.

107
00:05:10,430 --> 00:05:12,340
THERE'S ONE PERSON WHO

108
00:05:12,340 --> 00:05:17,040
IF IT EXISTS IS ALSO APPARENTLY
PART OF THIS WAR AND THIS ONE

109
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:18,430
HITS CLOSE TO HOME.

110
00:05:18,430 --> 00:05:22,670
ALL MY GOD,
ET TU, IVANKA?

111
00:05:22,670 --> 00:05:25,520
THAT SAYS HAPPY

112
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:29,470
HOLIDAYS, WE KNEW IVANKA
COULDN'T BE TRUSTED, OR PERHAPS

113
00:05:29,470 --> 00:05:33,360
IT'S BECAUSE SHE CONVERTED TO
JUDAISM SO HAPPY HOLIDAYS MAKE

114
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:34,360
SENSE.

115
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:38,060
WILL HE FORCE HIS OWN
DAUGHTER AND SON-IN-LAW AND

116
00:05:38,060 --> 00:05:41,150
GRANDCHILDREN TO SAY CHRISTMAS?

117
00:05:41,150 --> 00:05:43,630
I DON'T CARE WHAT RELIGION YOU

118
00:05:43,630 --> 00:05:46,120
ARE IN, SAY CHRISTMAS!

119
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:47,120
INSANE.

120
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:48,790
BUT THERE'S ONE GUY WE KNOW WHO

121
00:05:48,790 --> 00:05:50,740
HAS ALWAYS BEEN ON THE RIGHT
SIDE BECAUSE HE TELLS IT LIKE IT

122
00:05:50,740 --> 00:05:53,430
IS, IT'S DONALD TRUMP, LET'S GO
TO A TWEET FROM DONALD TRUMP

123
00:05:53,430 --> 00:05:55,650
FROM 2010.

124
00:05:55,650 --> 00:05:59,050
WISHING EVERYONE A
VERY HAPPY HOLIDAY SEASON.

125
00:05:59,050 --> 00:06:00,050
OH

126
00:06:00,050 --> 00:06:04,600
NO, DONALD, NOT YOU TOO!

127
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:05,990
I'M
GLAD TO SEE THAT DONALD TRUMP

128
00:06:05,990 --> 00:06:09,620
HAS ALSO ESCAPED FROM THE WAR ON
CHRISTMAS, APPARENTLY HE WAS A

129
00:06:09,620 --> 00:06:13,010
HOSTAGE ON THE OTHER SIDE, AND
IS NOW ON THE RIGHT SIDE OF

130
00:06:13,010 --> 00:06:14,430
ISSUES.

131
00:06:14,430 --> 00:06:17,970
OR PERHAPS THIS IS ALL A
LOAD OF HORSE CRAP AND MEANT TO

132
00:06:17,970 --> 00:06:22,350
DIVIDE US AT A TIME WHERE WE ARE
SUPPOSED TO HAVE HOLIDAY CHEER,

133
00:06:22,350 --> 00:00:00,000
AND SHOW KINDNESS TO ONE
ANOTHER.
