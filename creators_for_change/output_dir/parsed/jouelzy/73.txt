this always shut up but girl you don't
want to hear me sing
the reformate machine
my right I'm like wow what was I doing

like wings before and for the one here
see adobe boo
and they're giving Watson's on their
software
this is pretty
and yeah yeah you look great all right
hello everyone we are here live at
VidCon 2017 and we are chatting with
jewel Z just a reminder people are
really feeding into the more visual
elements of life and I wanted to remind
us that there are still ways to think
deeper in just looking at pretty
pictures and how we consume pop culture
and media so why do you choose to use
Adobe tools for your videos well because
of the control that it gives you in
being able to customize the way that you
want your visuals to look you have a lot
more yeah you have a lot more control
over your stuff over your software and
creating the content so I use Premiere
Pro I use Photoshop for my thumbnails I
also the guys have a blog and I publish
the books I've used in design just why
is the content that you're creating more
important now than ever
um it's more important now I think oh
okay hmm that's a deep question oh girl
you just put me on the spot it's more
important now because I think we're
really I think we're more cognizant of
the fact that we are becoming history
and I mean this is never not been true I
think that's what separates humans from
like animals is that we create history
but I think at this time period because
so much is happening and there's so many
emotions and some of different feelings
happening and there's really high points
of negativity and really high points are
patented me that we're realizing how
much how we are become gonna become the
day in history books and so I think
people are becoming more cognizant of
what part of the day they want to be a
child dj khaled you know we don't wanna
be the negative day we want to be the
day that provoked positive change I
think I did
and she's gonna teach me how to do my
audio better execution ha ha
we're gonna get audio so important yes
I'm gonna get a lesson on some Premiere
Pro stuff
