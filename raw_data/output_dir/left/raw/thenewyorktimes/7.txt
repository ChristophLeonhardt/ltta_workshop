1
00:00:01,210 --> 00:00:03,710
Not for a charcoal grill,
no charcoal grills are allowed

2
00:00:03,710 --> 00:00:04,665
You’re scared.

3
00:00:04,665 --> 00:00:05,939
Please leave me alone.

4
00:00:05,939 --> 00:00:06,732
You're white.

5
00:00:06,732 --> 00:00:07,872
African-American

6
00:00:07,872 --> 00:00:10,090
Illegally selling water
without a permit.

7
00:00:10,090 --> 00:00:13,880
But with cellphone cameras and
social media calling 911

8
00:00:13,880 --> 00:00:16,350
on your black or
brown neighbors just

9
00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:18,270
isn’t what it used to be.

10
00:00:18,270 --> 00:00:22,860
Hi, I’m Niecy Nash, actress,
inventor and advocate

11
00:00:22,860 --> 00:00:27,590
for not calling 911 on black people
for no goddamn reason.

12
00:00:28,470 --> 00:00:31,560
I’d like to introduce you to
a radical new product

13
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:34,620
that will save you all the
headaches of being filmed

14
00:00:34,620 --> 00:00:37,500
and outed as a racist douche.

15
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:40,530
It’s called 1-844-WYT-FEAR

16
00:00:40,530 --> 00:00:43,810
and it's revolutionizing the way
racist white people

17
00:00:43,810 --> 00:00:46,390
cope with black people
living life near them.

18
00:00:46,390 --> 00:00:48,052
1-844-WYT-FEAR?

19
00:00:48,052 --> 00:00:50,010
There’s a black guy
outside my neighbor’s house

20
00:00:50,010 --> 00:00:52,020
and he’s walking around.

21
00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:55,200
Our experienced staff
have been living

22
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:58,510
while black in America
their entire lives.

23
00:00:58,510 --> 00:01:01,410
Darren, here, is a
former Obama aide

24
00:01:01,410 --> 00:01:04,170
who had the cops called
on him for moving

25
00:01:04,170 --> 00:01:05,700
into his new apartment.

26
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:09,870
That is actually
your neighbor Michael.

27
00:01:09,870 --> 00:01:10,740
Yeah, no problem.

28
00:01:10,740 --> 00:01:11,881
Our records are
actually showing

29
00:01:11,881 --> 00:01:14,340
that's actually his boat.

30
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:14,950
Yeah, I know.

31
00:01:14,950 --> 00:01:16,350
black people have
boats too, now.

32
00:01:16,350 --> 00:01:18,690
Studies show that
people of color

33
00:01:18,690 --> 00:01:22,590
are more likely to be arrested,
convicted, and serve longer

34
00:01:22,590 --> 00:01:25,920
sentences than white
people for similar crimes.

35
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:29,340
So calling 911 for
non-emergency situations

36
00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:31,560
is really just a [expletive] move.

37
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:32,990
I got so scared when
I saw a black guy

38
00:01:32,990 --> 00:01:34,620
walking around outside.

39
00:01:34,620 --> 00:01:37,060
And so I called
1-844-WYT-FEAR.

40
00:01:37,060 --> 00:01:40,010
And it turns out
we’re neighbors.

41
00:01:40,010 --> 00:01:41,490
And I'm a racist.

42
00:01:41,490 --> 00:01:44,220
Now black people have
been helping white people

43
00:01:44,220 --> 00:01:46,170
be better since,

44
00:01:46,170 --> 00:01:47,200
always.

45
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:49,960
So she’s looking around
and standing there?

46
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:51,890
Regular Frisbee or Ultimate Frisbee?

47
00:01:52,590 --> 00:01:55,250
Call it when black people are:

48
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:24,720
1-844-WYT-FEAR

49
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:28,040
It’s a real number
for real white people

50
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:30,680
who should mind
their own damn business.

51
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:31,374
What's going on here?

52
00:02:31,374 --> 00:02:33,420
If you have been a victim
of 911 harassment
