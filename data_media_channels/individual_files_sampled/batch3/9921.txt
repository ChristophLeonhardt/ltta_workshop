WITH SIMON JOURNALISTS FOOD ANNOUNCED TRUMP WHEN HE WAS EXCHANGING NUCLEAR THREATS WITH KIM NOW SEEM UNWILLING TO GIVE THEM A CHANCE. Shannon: THANK YOU VERY MUCH. ONE OF THE PRESIDENT'S FIRST CALLS AFTER THE SUMMIT WAS TO OUR NEXT GUEST IN SOME OF HIS COLLEAGUES ON CAPITOL HILL. REPUBLICAN SENATOR JOHN BARRASSO FROM WYOMING SITS ON THE SENATE FOREIGN RELATIONS COMMITTEE AND YOU CHATTED WITH THE PRESIDENT. HOW DID HE SOUND? OPTIMISTIC. CONGRATULATIONS TO THE PRESIDENT. THIS WAS A HISTORIC AND IMPORTANT FIRST STEP IN THESE ONGOING DISCUSSIONS TO ELIMINATE NUCLEAR WEAPONS FROM NORTH KOREA. THE PRESIDENT FELT HE HAD MADE PROGRESS AND HE IS STILL VERY CLEAR EYED ABOUT THIS. WERE GOING TO HAVE TO SEE WHAT HAPPENS. MIKE POMPEO AS WELL AS JOHN BOLTON WILL BE MEETING WITH THE NORTH KOREANS NEXT WEEK TO TAKE THE NEXT STEP. WE NEED TO MAKE SURE WE HAVE SOMETHING VERIFIABLE AND ENFORCEABLE AND ACCOMPLISHES WHAT WE NEED FOR AMERICA'S SECURITY AND SAFETY AT HOME WHICH IS NORTH KOREA WITH NO NUCLEAR WEAPONS. Shannon: YOU KNOW THAT IT'S WHAT CRITICS HAVE SAID. THAT THERE ISN'T THAT FRAMEWORK. ALL THE THINGS CRITICAL TO THIS. ONE OF YOUR DEMOCRATIC COLLEAGUES CHUCK SCHUMER HAD THIS TO SAY. THE BOTTOM LINE IS THIS: WHAT THE UNITED STATES HAS GAINED IS VAGUE AND UNVIABLE UNVERIFIABLE. WE HOPE THIS DOESN'T CONTINUE. Shannon: WORK FOR SECRETARY POMPEO AND OTHER STAFFERS TO DO IN GETTING SOMETHING DONE. HOW DID THEY GO ABOUT IT IN A WAY THAT WILL SATISFY THE PRESIDENT'S CRITICS, OR CAN THEY PRESIDENT'S CRITICS, OR CAN THE THEY? SOME CREDITS YOU WILL NEVER SATISFY. WHEN THE PRESIDENT SET UP THE SUMMIT, THEY CRITICIZED HIM AND WHEN HE CANCELED THE SUMMIT THEY CRITICIZED HIM. WHEN HE WENT AHEAD WITH THE SUMMIT, THEY CRITICIZED HIM STILL. WE TALKED ABOUT WHAT THE PRESIDENT WAS WHEN HE CAME INTO OFFICE, BARACK OBAMA SAID WE WERE ON THE VERGE OF WAR WITH NORTH KOREA. AT THAT TIME, WE WERE. WE SAW IN NORTH KOREA'S SOPHISTICATION. IT INCREASED DRAMATICALLY. NOW LOOK AT WHERE WE ARE TODAY. AS A RESULT OF THE SUMMIT, THE WORLD IS MORE SAFE, MORE SECURE, MORE STABLE THAN IT WAS BEFOREHAND. WE HAVE A LOT OF WORK TO DO AND I WANT SOMETHING THAT ACTUALLY CAN BE A TREATY WITH THE ARAD AGREEMENT FELL APART, TERRIBLE AGREEMENT BUT IT WAS NEVER BROUGHT TO THE ELECTED MEMBERS OF THE UNITED STATES SENATE REPRESENTING THE PEOPLE OF THE COUNTRY. INSTEAD, THEY TOOK IT TO THE UNITED NATIONS. I WANT SOMETHING WITH NORTH KOREA WE CAN TAKE TO THE U.S. SENATE AND GET CONFIRMED AS A TREATY. THAT'S HOW YOU HAVE LASTING RELATIONSHIPS. Shannon: THE PRESIDENT TONIGHT SAYING THAT'S ABSOLUTELY WHAT HE WANTS TO DO AND THAT'S HIS GOAL THAT YOU CAN VOTE ON THAT WILL BE BINDING THAT HOPEFULLY HAS BIPARTISAN BACKING. WE TALKED, HOWIE DID AND WE REFERENCE SENATOR RUBIO. HE SAID "I TOO HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT HOW THIS WILL TURN OUT BUT I DON'T RECALL THE EXPERTS CRITICIZING OBAMA WHEN HE MET WITH THE BRUTAL DICTATOR IN CUBA WHO OVERSAW A POLICE STATE AND KILLED IN JAIL HIS OPPONENTS. #DoubleStandard. HE'S THOUGHTFUL ON THESE ISSUES, SPENT SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT PRESIDENT GAVE UP NOTHING. HE COULD HAVE PUSHED THE PAUSE BUTTON ON SOME OF THESE MILITARY EXERCISES BUT WE ONLY DO TWO A YEAR. WE DID ONE IN THE SPRING. THIS ONE, FOR MONTHS TO COME. IT WOULD BE EASY TO PUT THAT ON. I THINK THE PRESIDENT IS GIVING UP NOTHING. WE'VE SHOWN IS THAT MAXIMUM PRESSURE WORKS. TOUGH TALK BY THE PRESIDENT WORKS. WE ARE IN MUCH BETTER SHAPE TODAY THAN WE WERE A BIG DAY PRESIDENT TRUMP TOOK OFFICE WITH REGARD TO INTERNATIONAL SECURITY AND FOCUS SPECIFICALLY. WE KNOW NUCLEAR WEAPONS IN THE HANDS OF NORTH KOREA MAKES THE WORLD LESS SAFE AND LESS STABLE AND LESS SECURE. Shannon: JUST ABOUT
