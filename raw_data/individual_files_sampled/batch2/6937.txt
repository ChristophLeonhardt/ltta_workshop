there's been quite a bit of backlash against NFL players who protested Donald Trump's statements on Twitter in regard to those who refuse to stand during the national anthem now one example of that was when Patriots players decided to kneel instead of stand after Trump's tweets these are players who just stood for the most of the time and then realized okay well we need to unite and we need to support those who want to kneel well Stephen Pena who is a public official in Brockton Massachusetts said some pretty negative things about patriot players who joined in on the protest now he's with the Parks and Recreation Commission and he left a comment on a Facebook story about kneeling Patriot players in which he referred to them as turds for taking a knee during the national anthem but it gets worse he says turds your dumb ass isn't paid to think about politics dance monkey dance now again this is a public official right in Brockton Massachusetts he's with Parks and Recreation he got quite a bit of backlash after he made those statements on a public forum online and so he just wants to make sure he clarifies what he meant by monkey he didn't mean for it to be racist he says it was not meant to be a racist comment and if it was taken as such that's regrettable okay so look it is there is a small percentage chance that this guy is totally clueless and doesn't know that is a derogatory comment aimed at african-americans a great majority of the time so but even if it even if we grant him that which I don't I think it's a small chance that he that he made an honest mistake even if you were to grant him that though so your thing is okay so if you are an entertainer of any sort a you're my monkey and so you're unlike other Americans like plumbers and guys who take care of parks you're not allowed to have an opinion and you're not allowed to be concerned that maybe your kids are gonna get shot when they're unarmed like it happened it to me or rice and Cleveland you're not allowed to participate in the process because you're there for the entertainment of this Steven Pina guy ran and so you're supposed to dance for him like a monkey so it's such an asshole thing to say any way you slice it I just feel like you know the people who are up in arms and make these types of statements online just fundamentally misunderstand what this country is supposed to be about right political activism political discourse I mean that is the heart of democracy making sure that people feel free to speak their mind and say what they need to say about a particular political issue they don't want that they want to shut them up so are you not in favor of free speech are you not in favor of a democratic system where people are able to take part in voting and voicing their opinions and engaging in this type of rhetoric it's crazy to me and if you didn't know that the great majority of the athletes doing it are black and the Desa derogatory thing to say about blacks and then that might get you in trouble you also haven't shown very good judgment as a public official but wait it's about to get much worse not for him but for the next guy yes okay so then there's the issue of a volunteer fire chief in Pittsburgh he was upset because of the Steelers protesting now the Steelers did something a little different from the Patriots they decided to stay in the tunnel during the national anthem instead of coming out and standing during the national anthem and so Paul Smith who is a volunteer firefighter at the Cecil volunteer fire station number two posted a derogatory response on Facebook which was directed at Mike Talman he's the head coach and he used a racial slur so I'm not gonna say the racial slur you guys know what it is but I will read you his comment he says Tomlin just added himself to the list of no good and words yes I said it so he seemed pretty proud of his statement there thought it was bold so let's pause there for a second before his eventual backpedal so he yeah you know he doesn't get himself in trouble first and no good n-word no lack of clarity here okay hey I know that like no matter what anybody says people always like but maybe no but maybe wasn't racist I mean that was as clear as you can possibly get there's no way to spin that yeah and and so remember that the players are protesting in the first place because they're treated as less than equal and and part of the idea here is black lives matter so here here's the guy saying oh yeah you're a no-good n-word so thereby validating the idea that some people think that your life isn't equal and and so it's just no lack of clarity but the second part that's amazing is he's a fire chief he's a public guys he says it's publicly on Facebook and feels emboldened to say it like it's okay I can come out of the closet now and he has it yes I said it take that UN words now I mean what are we supposed to do here are we supposed to have understanding for them it's crazy so I mean what if they they're going into a situation where there's a fire in an African Americans house is he not going to want to rescue them because there are no good n words that's right so that's you know look the reason why these stories matter and it's not random private citizens these are public officials in this case we're talking about a fire chief and if he perceives a certain group of people as less than as not as important as not as valuable to society then does that impact the way he does his job you know and you're talking about people's lives here and and that's the reason why I really stood out to me and again it was so clear what he said was clear there wasn't any you know there was the same excuse that the initial person that we talked about used where it's like oh I didn't know that monkeys was a negative way to refer to black people in this case you know the n-word is not the way that you should have refer to black people you know that that's offensive beyond offensive yeah and before we get to his non apology he's a fire chief so whether he does it consciously or maybe just subconsciously you see less likely to send people into harm's way into a fire which is their job Ranch is an amazing job my nephew is a volunteer firefighter too and it's a hell of a job but is he maybe gonna take less of a chance if it's an african-american household as opposed to a white household well if he thinks that you're not equal maybe and then if your kids die because no no we can't have it that's crazy so now he's non-apology he says I am embarrassed at this I want to apologize I was frustrated and angry at the Steelers not standing the anthem this had nothing to do with my fire department I regret what I said but here's the thing there have been countless times where I've been angry let's say at a story that we're covering and my initial reaction isn't to talk about their race or say something disparaging about their ethnicity their race their background have I said offensive things about certain people absolutely but my mind just doesn't go there the fact that his mind immediately went to no good n-word I mean there's no excuse for that yeah so there's a thousand ways to attack people and and we would know it hang them based on their race makes no sense at all so and look here he says I regret what I said well hey Jake is that an apology no it just means I regret I got in trouble for it remember here's the original comment was yeah I said it yeah and now all of a sudden oh I regret what I said because he's embarrassed by it and then he but the thing that annoying me the most was I I don't want this had nothing to do with my fire department yeah we know that we're not putting it on your fire department we're not you as the fire chief who probably shouldn't be a fire you know why he's saying that because he's hiding behind the fire department nobody was criticizing your fire department we were criticizing you so when you say I don't want this to be on the fire department in other words remember I'll go with the fire department okay and it's not fair to blame them well nobody's doing that so problem solved okay so yes these guys exist men and if you're not black you could be outraged by it and we're outraged by it and and that shows that you have empathy and god bless your heart but even if you're if you're in that category or not in that category just think for a second if you are black in this country and you know a certain percentage of the police chiefs and the fire chiefs and guys who you know drive ambulances and maliska was on and on don't think that you're equal to other people and they think that your life doesn't matter as much but don't complain about it okay don't don't protest in the streets that would be inconvenient for people and don't be peaceful in your protest either were you just kneel during the national anthem just don't don't complain you're not allowed to yes that's their take I even hesitate talking about it to some degree because I feel that it's so depressing and but look the way that we're gonna get past it is to talk about it and and to tackle this and to solve this as a country together because it is unacceptable for certain percentage of Americans to think I might not get rescued because of what that guy thinks about my whole race help us build independent media become a member of the Young Turks TYT Network comm /join
