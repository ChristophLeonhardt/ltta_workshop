my first meal is at Q p.m. and then I eat from 2 to 10 over the last 5 years I have been doing it intermittent fasting and so what happens is I work out very very early in the morning but then I don't eat my first meal is at 2 p.m. and then I eat from 2 to 10 now then the times I don't eat a fasting period which is a 16-hour fasting I drink amino-acid drinks I'll have coffee maybe tea sometimes I'll have a little coconut oil on a spoon that makes you feel a little satiated that kind of thing but it's never a meal and then once I get on my meals it's good now the problem with intermittent fasting is that you never want to have a bad meal I could be like I waited all day 16 hours for this over the last five years it's really kept me in great great shape they found scientifically there's a thing called etapa G etapa G is when the cells in your body are rebuilding themselves it's one of the things where when you go without the food it's it's really strengthens your cells the cells are trying to rebuild it trying to do their thing and it's a wonderful thing it's kind of like renewed once it's done digesting the body done working with food it starts to work on other cells in the body I can feel the difference I literally can put pictures of myself now virtual pictures of myself at 22 years old and I look and feel much better right now
