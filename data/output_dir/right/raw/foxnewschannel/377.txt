1
00:00:07,163 --> 00:00:09,364
>> Laura: THE MAN WHO IS

2
00:00:09,365 --> 00:00:11,733
REALLY LEAD AND GALVANIZE THE

3
00:00:11,734 --> 00:00:12,968
G.O.P.'S EFFORTS TO RALLY BEHIND

4
00:00:12,969 --> 00:00:14,069
JUDGE KAVANAUGH'S LINDSEY

5
00:00:14,070 --> 00:00:14,402
GRAHAM.

6
00:00:14,403 --> 00:00:16,972
ONE WEEK AFTER HIS FIERY CALL TO

7
00:00:16,973 --> 00:00:18,173
ARMS, I LOVED IT!

8
00:00:18,174 --> 00:00:19,841
THE SENATOR IS FEELING MORE

9
00:00:19,842 --> 00:00:22,143
CONFIDENT THAN AFTER AFTER

10
00:00:22,144 --> 00:00:23,678
READING THE FBI REPORT ON BRETT

11
00:00:23,679 --> 00:00:24,045
KAVANAUGH.

12
00:00:24,046 --> 00:00:24,779
SENATOR GRAHAM JOINS US HOW TO

13
00:00:24,780 --> 00:00:26,381
TALK ABOUT THAT AND WHAT IS

14
00:00:26,382 --> 00:00:27,983
NEXT, SENATOR THANK YOU SO MUCH

15
00:00:27,984 --> 00:00:28,783
FOR BEING HERE.

16
00:00:28,784 --> 00:00:30,085
WHAT OTHER GAMES CAN WE EXPECT

17
00:00:30,086 --> 00:00:31,353
FROM THE DEMOCRATS BEFORE THIS

18
00:00:31,354 --> 00:00:34,022
THING GOES TO THE FINAL VOTE?

19
00:00:34,023 --> 00:00:35,724
>> THEY WILL DO IT.

20
00:00:35,725 --> 00:00:38,159
IF THEY COULD WRITE A BOOK ABOUT

21
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:39,728
OVERPLAYING THEIR HANDS IN

22
00:00:39,729 --> 00:00:41,329
POLITICS, THIS ISN'T THE FIRST

23
00:00:41,330 --> 00:00:41,930
CHAPTER.

24
00:00:41,931 --> 00:00:45,000
THE FBI REPORTS, THE BACKGROUND

25
00:00:45,001 --> 00:00:45,767
INTERVIEWED NINE PEOPLE.

26
00:00:45,768 --> 00:00:47,402
THEY FOLLOW THE DIRECTION OF THE

27
00:00:47,403 --> 00:00:48,103
THREE SENATORS WHO ASKED FOR

28
00:00:48,104 --> 00:00:51,139
MORE INVESTIGATION.

29
00:00:51,140 --> 00:00:53,642
IT CAME BACK VERY GOOD FOR JUDGE

30
00:00:53,643 --> 00:00:55,043
KAVANAUGH AND NOW I WOULD EXPECT

31
00:00:55,044 --> 00:00:56,544
HE SENATORS TO VOTE YES.

32
00:00:56,545 --> 00:00:57,312
I HOPE THEY WILL BECAUSE THAT IS

33
00:00:57,313 --> 00:00:59,481
WHAT THEY ASKED FOR.

34
00:00:59,482 --> 00:01:01,016
>> Laura: THE COMPLAINT FROM

35
00:01:01,017 --> 00:01:01,383
THE LEFT.

36
00:01:01,384 --> 00:01:03,919
THERE ARE A LOT OF THEM.

37
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:04,686
WE HAVE A FEW SENATORS, A FEW OF

38
00:01:04,687 --> 00:01:08,757
YOUR FRIENDS AND OTHERS WHO

39
00:01:08,758 --> 00:01:09,224
COMMENTED TODAY.

40
00:01:09,225 --> 00:01:09,925
LET'S WATCH.

41
00:01:09,926 --> 00:01:12,761
>> IT IS OBVIOUSLY A COVER-UP.

42
00:01:12,762 --> 00:01:14,763
THE TRUMP WHITE HOUSE WORKING

43
00:01:14,764 --> 00:01:15,463
WITH THE REPUBLICAN LEADERSHIP

44
00:01:15,464 --> 00:01:18,867
IN THE SENATE HAVE DELIBERATELY

45
00:01:18,868 --> 00:01:20,068
CIRCUMSCRIBED THIS

46
00:01:20,069 --> 00:01:20,502
INVESTIGATION.

47
00:01:20,503 --> 00:01:23,605
THEY'RE MAKING A MOCKERY OF THE

48
00:01:23,606 --> 00:01:29,311
CONSTITUTIONAL CLIMATE.

49
00:01:29,312 --> 00:01:31,613
SPEAK UP THAT IS NOT UNDER

50
00:01:31,614 --> 00:01:40,422
INVESTIGATION IT IS A

51
00:01:40,423 --> 00:01:41,589
INVESTIGATION.

52
00:01:41,590 --> 00:01:44,592
>> Laura: THEY DIDN'T

53
00:01:44,593 --> 00:01:45,260
INTERVIEW HER COUSIN SECOND

54
00:01:45,261 --> 00:01:48,530
TWICE REMOVED.

55
00:01:48,531 --> 00:01:51,232
>> THIS IS YOUR VIEW OF THE

56
00:01:51,233 --> 00:01:53,568
SENATE'S ROLE IS TO TAKE A GOOD

57
00:01:53,569 --> 00:01:58,006
MAN'S LIFE AND TURN IT UPSIDE

58
00:01:58,007 --> 00:02:00,442
DOWN, BETRAY DR. FORD'S TRUST.

59
00:02:00,443 --> 00:02:02,010
DO EVERYTHING IN THE WORLD TO

60
00:02:02,011 --> 00:02:03,345
DESTROY HIM.

61
00:02:03,346 --> 00:02:05,113
THAT DOES NOT ADVISE CONSENTS

62
00:02:05,114 --> 00:02:05,647
THAT IS DESPICABLE.

63
00:02:05,648 --> 00:02:07,248
IT IS GOING TO BLOW UP IN YOUR

64
00:02:07,249 --> 00:02:08,149
FACE.

65
00:02:08,150 --> 00:02:09,351
I HOPE IT DOES BECAUSE IF IT

66
00:02:09,352 --> 00:02:10,719
GOES WRONG HE WILL GET ON THE

67
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:11,353
COURT.

68
00:02:11,354 --> 00:02:13,822
THEY HAVE NO IDEA OF WHAT THE

69
00:02:13,823 --> 00:02:14,589
FBI SUPPLEMENTED INVESTIGATION

70
00:02:14,590 --> 00:02:15,724
WAS ABOUT.

71
00:02:15,725 --> 00:02:17,192
THEY MADE UP THEIR MINDS TO VOTE

72
00:02:17,193 --> 00:02:20,762
NO BEFORE ANYONE SAID NO.

73
00:02:20,763 --> 00:02:21,663
HEAR WHAT THEY ASKED FOR, THEY

74
00:02:21,664 --> 00:02:27,135
ASKED THAT THE PEOPLE WHO NAMED

75
00:02:27,136 --> 00:02:28,336
HER GOT INTERVIEWED AND

76
00:02:28,337 --> 00:02:29,738
MISS RAMIREZ BE INTERVIEWED.

77
00:02:29,739 --> 00:02:32,207
THAT WAS DONE PLUS FOUR, FIVE

78
00:02:32,208 --> 00:02:32,674
OTHER WITNESSES.

79
00:02:32,675 --> 00:02:36,544
THE RESULTS ARE IN.

80
00:02:36,545 --> 00:02:37,078
SENATOR COLLINS AND

81
00:02:37,079 --> 00:02:37,712
SENATOR FLAKE BUT IT WAS

82
00:02:37,713 --> 00:02:38,079
THOROUGH.

83
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:40,148
THE THOUGHT IT WAS FAIR.

84
00:02:40,149 --> 00:02:40,915
THESE TWO PEOPLE ARE MY FRIENDS

85
00:02:40,916 --> 00:02:41,750
AND THEY HAVE NO IDEA WHO THEY

86
00:02:41,751 --> 00:02:49,724
TALK ABOUT.

87
00:02:49,725 --> 00:02:50,358
>> Laura: SENATOR SCHUMER

88
00:02:50,359 --> 00:02:54,329
TALKED ABOUT THE EMOTION THAT

89
00:02:54,330 --> 00:02:55,663
DROVE CHRISTINE FORD IN THE

90
00:02:55,664 --> 00:02:57,932
COUNTRY RALLYING BEHIND HER, IT

91
00:02:57,933 --> 00:03:00,168
SEEMS LIKE HE IS TAKEN THIS IN A

92
00:03:00,169 --> 00:03:00,602
MIDTERM POSE.

93
00:03:00,603 --> 00:03:02,771
LET'S WATCH.

94
00:03:02,772 --> 00:03:05,140
>> DR. FORD CAME FORWARD AND ONE

95
00:03:05,141 --> 00:03:08,943
AMERICA'S HEARTS.

96
00:03:08,944 --> 00:03:10,412
A REPUBLICAN COLLEAGUES WERE

97
00:03:10,413 --> 00:03:12,013
UPSET THAT THAT MIGHT DERAIL

98
00:03:12,014 --> 00:03:16,317
THEIR HEADLONG RUSH TO PUT JUDGE

99
00:03:16,318 --> 00:03:19,788
KAVANAUGH ON THE SUPREME COURT.

100
00:03:19,789 --> 00:03:22,123
>> Laura: THE HEADLONG RUSH?

101
00:03:22,124 --> 00:03:22,857
YOU'RE RUSHING THIS BECAUSE YOU

102
00:03:22,858 --> 00:03:25,660
WANT TO GET IT DONE AS FAST AS

103
00:03:25,661 --> 00:03:27,562
POSSIBLE.

104
00:03:27,563 --> 00:03:28,363
THIS WAS EMOTIONALLY BASED AND

105
00:03:28,364 --> 00:03:30,098
USED BY THOSE PROTESTERS TODAY

106
00:03:30,099 --> 00:03:31,733
ON CAPITOL HILL, A LOT OF WOMEN.

107
00:03:31,734 --> 00:03:32,700
THEY TOOK OVER THE OFFICE

108
00:03:32,701 --> 00:03:34,602
BUILDING FOR I DON'T KNOW HOW

109
00:03:34,603 --> 00:03:34,903
LONG.

110
00:03:34,904 --> 00:03:35,804
THEY PROMISE THAT THEY WERE

111
00:03:35,805 --> 00:03:36,504
GONNA KEEP DOING THIS.

112
00:03:36,505 --> 00:03:38,640
THEY ARE GOING TO KEEP TACKLING

113
00:03:38,641 --> 00:03:40,942
YOU GUYS IN ELEVATORS AND

114
00:03:40,943 --> 00:03:43,745
QUARTERING YOU IN THE HALLS.

115
00:03:43,746 --> 00:03:45,313
THE PROTEST CULTURE IS GOING TO

116
00:03:45,314 --> 00:03:45,680
CONTINUE.

117
00:03:45,681 --> 00:03:48,349
>> IT WON'T WORK FOR ME.

118
00:03:48,350 --> 00:03:49,617
I THINK MY COLLEAGUES FEEL

119
00:03:49,618 --> 00:03:51,086
OFFENDED AS DOES

120
00:03:51,087 --> 00:03:51,553
SENATOR SCHUMER.

121
00:03:51,554 --> 00:03:53,121
I'VE NEVER BEEN MORE

122
00:03:53,122 --> 00:03:55,423
DISAPPOINTED IN YOU AND YOUR

123
00:03:55,424 --> 00:03:57,826
PARTY.

124
00:03:57,827 --> 00:04:00,528
SHE REQUESTED TO REMAIN

125
00:04:00,529 --> 00:04:01,429
ANONYMOUS, IT WAS SOMEBODY ON

126
00:04:01,430 --> 00:04:02,897
YOUR SIDE WHO LEAKED IT TO THE

127
00:04:02,898 --> 00:04:06,334
PRESS FOR POLITICAL PURPOSE.

128
00:04:06,335 --> 00:04:10,105
HER OWN LAWYERS WHO WERE ADVISED

129
00:04:10,106 --> 00:04:12,307
TO BE APPOINTED BY

130
00:04:12,308 --> 00:04:13,308
SENATOR FEINSTEIN, THE MOST

131
00:04:13,309 --> 00:04:14,042
CLINICALLY ACTIVE PERSON

132
00:04:14,043 --> 00:04:17,545
APPARENTLY NEVER TOLD DR. FORD

133
00:04:17,546 --> 00:04:18,947
THAT THEY WERE GOING TO

134
00:04:18,947 --> 00:04:19,947
CALIFORNIA TO AVOID ANY

135
00:04:19,949 --> 00:04:20,548
EMBARRASSMENT.

136
00:04:20,548 --> 00:04:21,248
PLEASE DON'T USE AND ABUSE HIS

137
00:04:21,250 --> 00:04:23,518
WOMAN ANYMORE.

138
00:04:23,519 --> 00:04:25,887
HER ACCUSATIONS HAVE NOT BEEN

139
00:04:25,888 --> 00:04:26,321
COOPERATED.

140
00:04:26,322 --> 00:04:28,323
WE DON'T KNOW ANYMORE THAN WE

141
00:04:28,324 --> 00:04:29,090
DID BEFORE.

142
00:04:29,091 --> 00:04:30,325
THE PEOPLE SHE NAMED, THEY DON'T

143
00:04:30,326 --> 00:04:31,926
KNOW WHAT SHE'S TALKING ABOUT.

144
00:04:31,927 --> 00:04:33,928
IT REALLY OFFENDS ME THAT

145
00:04:33,929 --> 00:04:35,096
SENATOR SCHUMER WOULD CONTINUE

146
00:04:35,097 --> 00:04:35,897
TO ABUSE DR. FORD.

147
00:04:35,898 --> 00:04:37,699
THEY ARE THE ONES WERE PLAYING

148
00:04:37,700 --> 00:04:39,434
POLITICS.

149
00:04:39,435 --> 00:04:40,435
I VOTED, NEVER THOUGHT TWICE

150
00:04:40,436 --> 00:04:40,802
ABOUT IT.

151
00:04:40,803 --> 00:04:43,204
I TELL YOU RIGHT NOW, THIS IS A

152
00:04:43,205 --> 00:04:45,106
DEFINING MOMENT FOR THE 2018

153
00:04:45,107 --> 00:04:45,473
ELECTION.

154
00:04:45,474 --> 00:04:47,408
THIS IS UNFAIR.

155
00:04:47,409 --> 00:04:48,309
>> Laura: LET'S TALK ABOUT

156
00:04:48,310 --> 00:04:49,644
REPERCUSSIONS FOR WHAT HAPPENS.

157
00:04:49,645 --> 00:04:53,414
HE DID THE FILING OF FALSE

158
00:04:53,415 --> 00:04:56,918
EVIDENCE, THAT CAN BE PROVED.

159
00:04:56,919 --> 00:04:58,219
WHAT ABOUT TO THIS LEAKING

160
00:04:58,220 --> 00:05:01,589
ISSUE, WE TALK ABOUT ON THE SHO

161
00:05:01,590 --> 00:05:02,323
SHOW.

162
00:05:02,324 --> 00:05:03,725
IT SEEMS LIKE SOMEONE IS NOT

163
00:05:03,726 --> 00:05:04,559
TELLING THE TRUTH HERE ABOUT

164
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:06,161
WHAT HAPPENED ON THE SENATE'S

165
00:05:06,162 --> 00:05:06,928
SIDE.

166
00:05:06,929 --> 00:05:07,529
DO YOU THINK WHAT DIANE

167
00:05:07,530 --> 00:05:10,665
FEINSTEIN SAID WHEN SHE SAID, I

168
00:05:10,666 --> 00:05:12,367
DIDN'T ASK ANYBODY AND THEN SHE

169
00:05:12,368 --> 00:05:14,669
SAID, OH, NO, THEY TELL ME I DID

170
00:05:14,670 --> 00:05:16,337
ASK THEM.

171
00:05:16,338 --> 00:05:18,339
NO ONE ON MY STAFF LEAKS IT.

172
00:05:18,340 --> 00:05:19,741
DO YOU BELIEVE THAT?

173
00:05:19,742 --> 00:05:20,909
>> I BELIEVE THAT SHE DIDN'T

174
00:05:20,910 --> 00:05:21,776
ONLY GET BETTER KNOW ABOUT HER

175
00:05:21,777 --> 00:05:22,343
STAFF.

176
00:05:22,344 --> 00:05:23,745
I DO KNOW THIS, OR STAFF

177
00:05:23,746 --> 00:05:27,448
RECOMMENDED TO DR. FORD WHO

178
00:05:27,449 --> 00:05:30,351
HATES TRUMP AND IS A POLITICALLY

179
00:05:30,352 --> 00:05:31,286
ACTIVIST LAWYER, APPARENTLY

180
00:05:31,287 --> 00:05:32,987
DR. FORD WAS NOT TOLD BY HER

181
00:05:32,988 --> 00:05:36,324
LEGAL TEAM.

182
00:05:36,325 --> 00:05:37,125
SOMEBODY ON THEIR SIDE LEAKED

183
00:05:37,126 --> 00:05:40,762
ANONYMOUS LETTER WITHOUT --

184
00:05:40,763 --> 00:05:42,363
>> Laura: SO ARE NOT SECURE

185
00:05:42,364 --> 00:05:46,134
THE EMAILS ON THEIR TAX?

186
00:05:46,135 --> 00:05:47,735
>> HERE IS WHAT I'M GONNA DO.

187
00:05:47,736 --> 00:05:48,803
ANYBODY WHO DID THIS IS GOING TO

188
00:05:48,804 --> 00:05:49,572
PAY A PRICE.

189
00:05:50,105 --> 00:05:52,807
THE PEOPLE WHO EXPOSED MY NAME,

190
00:05:52,808 --> 00:05:53,241
SENATOR HATCH.

191
00:05:53,242 --> 00:05:55,743
THAT PERSON IS GOING TO PAY A

192
00:05:55,744 --> 00:05:56,044
PRICE.

193
00:05:56,045 --> 00:05:57,478
MY GOAL IF I AM CHAIRMAN IS TO

194
00:05:57,479 --> 00:05:58,313
MAKE SURE NEVER HAPPENS AGAIN.

195
00:05:58,314 --> 00:06:00,515
THE BEST WAY TO MEASURE NEVER

196
00:06:00,516 --> 00:06:01,282
HAPPENS AGAIN IS TO PUNISH THOSE

197
00:06:01,283 --> 00:06:03,518
WHO DID IT.

198
00:06:03,519 --> 00:06:04,485
>> Laura: WHAT LESSON YOU

199
00:06:04,486 --> 00:06:05,253
THINK THE PRESIDENT SHOULD TAKE

200
00:06:05,254 --> 00:06:07,789
OUT OF ALL THIS?

201
00:06:07,790 --> 00:06:13,194
THIS WAS A MOMENT, THE PARTY GOT

202
00:06:13,195 --> 00:06:14,128
UNIFIED.

203
00:06:14,129 --> 00:06:17,098
THE ECONOMY IS ON FIRE.

204
00:06:17,099 --> 00:06:17,699
GREAT JUDGES.

205
00:06:17,700 --> 00:06:19,901
NAFTA WAS RENEGOTIATED.

206
00:06:19,902 --> 00:06:20,368
WHAT IS NEXT?

207
00:06:20,369 --> 00:06:22,103
>> THE PRESIDENT SHOULD TAKE THE

208
00:06:22,104 --> 00:06:24,239
FOLLOWING, IF YOU APPOINT A GOOD

209
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:27,342
PERSON WHO GETS DESTROYED IN A

210
00:06:27,343 --> 00:06:28,943
DESPICABLE MANNER AND YOU FIGHT

211
00:06:28,944 --> 00:06:30,878
FOR HIM, PEOPLE WILL LIKE YOU

212
00:06:30,879 --> 00:06:31,679
MORE.

213
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:32,680
WHETHER YOU ARE TRUMP REPUBLICAN

214
00:06:32,681 --> 00:06:37,285
OR BUSH REPUBLICAN, LIBERTARIAN

215
00:06:37,286 --> 00:06:38,086
OR VEGETARIAN REPUBLICAN.

216
00:06:38,087 --> 00:06:40,221
WE ARE ALL TOGETHER NOW THANKS

217
00:06:40,222 --> 00:06:42,123
TO THIS DESPICABLE ATTACK ON A

218
00:06:42,124 --> 00:06:42,490
GOOD MAN.

219
00:06:42,491 --> 00:06:43,524
HERE'S WHAT I WANT THE PRESIDENT

220
00:06:43,525 --> 00:06:44,325
TO KNOW.

221
00:06:44,326 --> 00:06:45,059
DO THE RIGHT THING AND FIGHT FOR

222
00:06:45,060 --> 00:06:47,929
IT AND YOU WILL GET REWARDED.

223
00:06:47,930 --> 00:06:49,697
CAVANAGH WILL BE ON THE BENCH.

224
00:06:49,698 --> 00:06:50,965
THOSE WHO TRY TO DESTROY HIM ARE

225
00:06:50,966 --> 00:06:52,467
GOING TO BE LOOKED AT AND THEY

226
00:06:52,468 --> 00:06:55,136
ARE GOING TO PAY A PRICE.

227
00:06:55,137 --> 00:06:57,005
I THINK THIS IS GOING TO HELP US

228
00:06:57,006 --> 00:06:57,472
IN THE MIDTERMS.

229
00:06:57,473 --> 00:06:58,873
I HATE THAT THIS IS WHAT IT TOOK

230
00:06:58,874 --> 00:07:01,509
TO HELP REPUBLICANS.

231
00:07:01,510 --> 00:07:03,177
TO THE OTHER SIDE, YOU MADE THE

232
00:07:03,178 --> 00:07:05,313
BIGGEST MISTAKE OF YOUR LIFE.

233
00:07:05,314 --> 00:07:06,648
TO  TO THE THREE REPUBLICANS, YO

234
00:07:06,649 --> 00:07:06,881
TO  TO THE THREE REPUBLICANS, YU

235
00:07:06,882 --> 00:07:09,717
WERE ALL FRIENDS OF MINE, PLEASE

236
00:07:09,718 --> 00:07:10,885
BE GUESSED NOW.

237
00:07:10,886 --> 00:07:12,954
EVERYTHING ABOUT HIM, JUDGE

238
00:07:12,955 --> 00:07:14,889
KAVANAUGH HE IS A GOOD MAN.

239
00:07:14,890 --> 00:07:17,058
SEVEN FBI INVESTIGATIONS.

240
00:07:17,059 --> 00:07:19,694
HUNDRED AND 56 PEOPLE.

241
00:07:19,695 --> 00:07:22,897
ALL OF THE STUFF IS GARBAGE.

242
00:07:22,898 --> 00:07:25,366
>> Laura: YOUR MANAGER BACK IN

243
00:07:25,367 --> 00:07:27,468
1998, I REMEMBER IT WELL,

244
00:07:27,469 --> 00:07:28,503
DEMOCRATS ARE PLEDGING THAT IF

245
00:07:28,504 --> 00:07:31,639
THEY TAKE THE HOUSE THEY COULD

246
00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:34,208
VERY WELL MOVE TO IMPEACH BRETT

247
00:07:34,209 --> 00:07:35,310
KAVANAUGH.

248
00:07:35,311 --> 00:07:36,010
GETTING HIM CONVICTED WILL BE

249
00:07:36,011 --> 00:07:38,746
VERY DIFFICULT TO DO, DO YOU

250
00:07:38,747 --> 00:07:40,081
EXPECT THAT TO HAPPEN IF

251
00:07:40,082 --> 00:07:42,116
REPUBLICANS LOSE THE HOUSE AND

252
00:07:42,117 --> 00:07:43,818
KEEP THIS SAGA GOING?

253
00:07:43,819 --> 00:07:45,620
>> I THINK THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY

254
00:07:45,621 --> 00:07:47,322
HAS BEEN TAKEN OVER BY

255
00:07:47,323 --> 00:07:47,989
RATIONALITY, HATRED IS THERE

256
00:07:47,990 --> 00:07:50,491
ONLY PLATFORM.

257
00:07:50,492 --> 00:07:51,326
IT IS NOT ABOUT WHO THEY LIKE IT

258
00:07:51,327 --> 00:07:56,931
IS ABOUT WHO THEY HATE.

259
00:07:56,932 --> 00:07:58,333
THE THOUGHT THAT YOU ARE GUILTY

260
00:07:58,334 --> 00:07:59,901
JUST BY THE ACCUSATION.

261
00:07:59,902 --> 00:08:03,671
IF A DEMOCRATIC NOMINEE WERE

262
00:08:03,672 --> 00:08:04,739
TREATED BY THE REPUBLICANS AS

263
00:08:04,740 --> 00:08:05,473
BRETT KAVANAUGH WAS TREATED BY

264
00:08:05,474 --> 00:08:09,277
THE DEMOCRATS, EVERYONE BE UP IN

265
00:08:09,278 --> 00:08:09,744
ARMS.

266
00:08:09,745 --> 00:08:13,281
JOE MANCHIN, WILL HE VOTE YES?

267
00:08:13,282 --> 00:08:15,616
>> IF YOU LISTENS TO THE PEOPLE

268
00:08:15,617 --> 00:08:16,718
OF WEST VIRGINIA HE WILL.

269
00:08:16,719 --> 00:08:18,886
BRETT DESERVES YOUR VOTE JOE.

270
00:08:18,887 --> 00:00:00,000
HE IS MY FRIEND, I'VE KNOWN HIM
