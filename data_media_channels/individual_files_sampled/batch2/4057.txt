let's begin with the historic weather even before hitting land hurricane Florence a category 2 storm is making its presence felt with wind gusts up to 110 miles an hour and widespread flooding already officials warned that Florence could bring substantial storm surges of up to 11 feet and more than 10 million people live live right now in the storm's path tens of thousands have already lost their power while North Carolina Governor Roy Cooper made this plea to area residents to anyone still unwilling to take this storm seriously let me be clear you need to get yourself to a safe place now and stay there we've got reporters all over the coast let's start with Gotti's Schwartz's and Beauford or Beauford north carolina daddy oh my gosh yeah that's that's right this has been the situation for the last of five or six hours tonight we're gonna see winds over a hundred miles an hour and we're gonna see a storm surge over it's just across the way we know that there are reports of homes already being flooded by some storm surge and you were talking a little bit ago about this being a category 2 hurricane a lot of people have dismissed this as a category 2 hurricane maybe choosing not to evacuate this is the strength of tropical storm force winds not that hurricane that hundred miles an hour plus hurricane winds those are coming they are very close to us and they're they're going to rake their way through North and South Carolina so right after this we can see on the radar they're approaching our location so we're gonna fall back so we'll send it back to you Chris well thank you very much got any shorts hang on there sir let's bring in NBC's Kerry Sanders from North Carolina's Carolina Beach Kerry I've seen you everywhere ever this this is something look looks a little calmer where you are right well that's because I moved to a protected area quite frankly I've been getting beaten up out there I'm going to step away just for a second I'm I'm soaked all the way through even with this close but I want to take you out to the Atlantic here and you can see sort of the force of the Atlantic and we've been talking about this but maybe we can explain a little bit about the concern about what is going to be the storm surge an 11-foot dome or wall of water that will come over the sand dunes over the boardwalk there and then we'll come in and with the force of the Atlantic behind it it potentially will damage take portions of homes and buildings we're in what is allegedly a constructed building here that is designed to handle up to a category three hurricane so we feel safe where we are the reason you don't see the wind blowing me right now is because well that is the Atlantic the wind is actually coming from this direction so I'm slightly protected but as that water comes in it's coming in with the hurricane in fact the eye is apparently right now forecast to come here in Carolina Beach Wrightsville Beach right about here so we're gonna see the strongest winds and potentially we might even see the eye wall come over of course that will come in between 4:00 and 10:00 a.m. because of the slow speed of all of this but it's that continental shelf out there that starts about 60 miles and it's a hundred and twenty feet and it just slopes right up so as the wind pushes the water on the top it builds it up and that is exactly what is ultimately the storm surge that folks are going to be dealing with but not too many folks here because thankfully most of them evacuated can a human being stand up and survive and not drown than a surge or you have to be out of the way to survive no I'm gonna tell you that I was in the beginning of storm surge during hurricane Matthew and there is no way you can stand in a storm surge I had to - fortunately got behind a building but I want to tell you that when the storm surge is coming in it's probably going to rip up portions of the boardwalk there because of the force of the Atlantic Ocean those boards are flying around there's other debris in the water it hits you there's absolutely no either an Olympic swimmer couldn't handle this I mean this is impossible to stand in it takes out portions of buildings and depending on the construction and maybe the age of the construction we have seen like hurricane I think it was Ike that that literally leveled an entire portion of Gilchrist Beach there was one house left so it's it's nothing that anybody could withstand and that's important because so often people say I want to stay I want to protect my property there's nothing you can do you can't pretend you see most people I guess if you're trained to do it can breathe up the three minutes or so but how many you couldn't even if you could stand up during these surges how long does the water stay at that level well let me tell you that I recently did swift water rescue because I was doing a story with the teams in upstate New York the idea of standing is actually dangerous too because you've got the water moving so it's your natural inclination to try and stand up but what happens is your feet down there get caught on something and then you get stuck and you can't get out and the water is coming over and down you go so there's all types of methods to protect yourself when you come up on your back put your harm arms in like this bring your feet up and then bring your arms out and begin to paddle but I got to tell you these may be methods but I don't think it's possible because you're gonna hit something your heads gonna get hit you might get knocked out this is this is really this is really why they say please please please fall back to the shelter's get away from where the storm surge is gonna be unless you have a secure location like we have here I think you made the point thank you so much Kerry Sanders for that public service warning because they ought to get out of the way let's go to Garrett Haake who's a New Bern New Bern North Carolina New Bern you know I've never been down there but it looks like a beautiful part of the country Gary but right now not a place to visit yeah I would probably stay away for a couple days Chris but it's interesting there's a lot of these old historic homes here that have been here for 200 years a lot of the folks who live down here say well my home has lasted this long maybe I don't need to leave but what we're experiencing right now is some of that storm surge that Kerry and others have been talking about this town is wrapped on two sides by the noose and all day long that news has been tightening if you'll forgive the pun the water has just been coming up out of the banks pressing further and further into these neighborhoods even on the street I'm standing on now we already had to abandon one live shot location it was going to turn into an island on the street I'm standing on now over the last hour I've watched I think our cameraman Brian can show it here this sort of crud getting pushed up the street here has pushed up a house and a half length in the last 45 minutes or so so this water is creeping down the street in a place where Chris we have not really seen a ton of rain so far we have not seen the tropical force winds so far we are on the lagging edge of this storm and already we're a block and a half in from the river and everything is starting to be taken by the river so this is gonna be a long night here and I think the big question for folks even folks like who've been here for 20 or 30 years is how far into this town does the river go is this is storm like others that they've seen or we're just gonna have such a amount of pressure such an amount of water pushing into the town that we're gonna see destruction that's beyond what folks who've been through Matthew and some of these other big storms here over the last couple years recognize and frankly Chris we're in that same guessing game ourselves here now trying to figure out if our safe house if the place where we've chosen to stay here tonight is going to be safe enough I'm looking at the water behind you it's surging behind you why the lights on in those houses though those people sticking it out the ones on that Street on both sides I see like oh you know I've got street lights on here behind our camera position there are some folks who are still in their homes I was just talking to them before we came on the air to see what their plans are but I don't think there's anybody left in any of these houses behind me Chris the power is still on here this is a place where they've got underground lines it's not been blown down yet by the wind at some point I am quite certain that will no longer be the case but the lights have stayed on the winds have stayed low and I think that's part of the reason people aren't a little bit more panicked at this point but this water I'm watching it come and it's coming slowly but it just keeps coming Chris and I think that's going to be the story in this part of the North Carolina coast well it's not to be fine in Carolina but thank you so much Garrett Haake it's a beautiful part of the country that what an excitement and danger we're facing all at once right now let's turn on now BC meteorologist jim bill Karin's of course to find it the latest bill you're the expert what's coming I I'm telling you look at Garrett and we all help the lights on him later on about midnight tonight the high tide on the Neuse River there and the New Bern area is going to be about 30 minutes past midnight the water level there is expected to be about 3 to 4 feet higher than where he's standing right now so picture what that is gonna look like and how close that water is gonna be to going in some of those homes so yeah that's the picture of the beautiful homes that are upped a little bit on the bank there but that water that's in the roads gonna go up about 3 to 4 feet additionally that will be into the first for a level of some of those homes there that's one of the big concerns there in the Neuse River Basin the Trent River the River Bend area there I know it well I lived in New Bern for a couple years I was there where he was standing when Bertha hit and it's already at those height levels so it's going to be a long night tonight and then tomorrow we're gonna do it again Chris at the morning high tide 12 hours later so let me get into the latest with the storm are still a category two it's been wobbling around a little bit here we're stuck in this outer band with tropical storm force winds we saw Gaddy blown around there and the Morehead City area he's located right here New Bern by the way it's located well inland here so it says it not just a coastal event it's even far inland that we're gonna see this flooding I am sure that there will be water rescues taking place at the high tide cycle tonight at midnight far away from the coast and inland areas where those rivers are getting backed up the winds are starting to pick up last check 78,000 people without power in Eastern North Carolina mostly Carteret County and mostly here in Craven County have locks been gusting the 63 54 in Hatteras isn't being too bad we're waiting for it in Wilmington but it's starting to freshen up at 47 so the storm is currently 90 miles east southeast of Wilmington and it looks like it's heading straight for Wilmington landfall predicted by the Hurricane Center somewhere there in the early morning hours maybe 8 a.m. to noon ashore so if it stalls out a little later than that but here's the 2:00 p.m. position almost over the top of Wilmington which by the way is about 20 to 30 miles inland from the coast and then it kind of rains itself out and heads down towards the Myrtle Beach area so the key times are the high tide cycles that's when we usually have the most fatalities that's when the most damage is done with the storm surge the next high tide is gonna be the one I was just talking about that's coming close to midnight from 1113 p.m. here near Wrightsville Beach little further up the coast high tides around 11:00 p.m. that'll be the highest water levels that we've seen so far with the storm now I just saw some new information that they actually are calling for the high tide tomorrow morning at 11 to 11 a.m. to noon to be even higher than the one tonight so at first it was look like tonight would be the worst that's not the case anymore so wherever the water level is this tonight at midnight it'll probably an additional foot maybe half a foot higher tomorrow morning that's the problem with the storm Chris it's one high tide cycle after the other so we get the high tide coming in we get the dunes taken out we get damage to the structures and then we're gonna do it again when there's no defenses and you get the wave action on top of it and then Chris we talked about the rain and we'll deal with this through the weekend but you know a huge area all the way through South Carolina is gonna get two feet of rain out of this so yeah it's just it's too much water too soon too you know it's a water problem the wind isn't gonna cause a ton of damage it's the water that was the biggest threat to lives and property hey
