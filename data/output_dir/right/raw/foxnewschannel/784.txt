THANKS.

5
00:00:09,671 --> 00:00:11,006

LIFE KNEW HIM AT WORK YOU CAN

7
00:00:12,007 --> 00:00:16,210

00:00:19,047 --> 00:00:20,348

00:00:20,348 --> 00:00:20,882
TONIGHT.

11
00:00:20,882 --> 00:00:21,650
BRET, THANK YOU FOR COMING ON.

12
00:00:21,650 --> 00:00:23,652
I KNOW HOW CLOSE YOU WERE TO

13
00:00:23,652 --> 00:00:25,320
CHARLES, SO I HESITATE ALMOST TO

14
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:27,055
ASK YOU ABOUT IT, BUT YOU ARE

15
00:00:27,055 --> 00:00:29,491
THE PERSON TO TALK TO.

16
00:00:29,491 --> 00:00:31,526
SOME HIM UP TO THE EXTENT YOU

17
00:00:31,526 --> 00:00:31,893
CAN.

18
00:00:31,893 --> 00:00:34,596
>> YEAH, TUCKER, THANKS FOR

19
00:00:34,596 --> 00:00:34,963
HAVING ME.

20
00:00:34,963 --> 00:00:37,499
I'M SORRY I'M OUT OF POCKET

21
00:00:37,499 --> 00:00:37,999
TODAY OF ALL DAYS.

22
00:00:37,999 --> 00:00:40,869
IT'S TREMENDOUSLY SAD.

23
00:00:40,869 --> 00:00:42,137
BRIT WAS REALLY ELOQUENT IN

24
00:00:42,137 --> 00:00:45,240
DESCRIBING CHARLES.

25
00:00:45,240 --> 00:00:48,110
HE WAS SO WISE, SO BRILLIANT,

26
00:00:48,110 --> 00:00:49,277
BUT ALSO SO CARING AND FUNNY.

27
00:00:49,277 --> 00:00:52,247
A LOT OF PEOPLE DIDN'T KNOW THAT

28
00:00:52,247 --> 00:00:52,681
PART OF HIM.

29
00:00:52,681 --> 00:00:54,950
HE WAS REALLY HYSTERICAL AND

30
00:00:54,950 --> 00:00:56,885
COULD GET PEOPLE LAUGHING.

31
00:00:56,885 --> 00:00:58,653
AT THE COMMERCIAL BREAKS ON

32
00:00:58,653 --> 00:01:00,322
"SPECIAL REPORT" ON THE PANEL,

33
00:01:00,322 --> 00:01:01,456
HE OWNED THE ROOM.

34
00:01:01,456 --> 00:01:03,258
HE WAS ALSO REALLY CARING.

35
00:01:03,258 --> 00:01:05,393
HE WAS THE PERSON WHO REACHED

36
00:01:05,393 --> 00:01:08,296
OUT FIRST, OR ONE OF THE FIRST,

37
00:01:08,296 --> 00:01:10,999
EVERY TIME MY SON HAD SOME OPEN

38
00:01:10,999 --> 00:01:14,069
HEART SURGERY OR SOME ISSUE IN

39
00:01:14,069 --> 00:01:14,870
THE HOSPITAL.

40
00:01:14,870 --> 00:01:16,872
HE WANTED TO KNOW SPECIFICS, HE

41
00:01:16,872 --> 00:01:18,173
WANTS TO KNOW WHAT THE DOCTOR

42
00:01:18,173 --> 00:01:18,473
SAID.

43
00:01:18,473 --> 00:01:19,741
HE WANTED TO KNOW.

44
00:01:19,741 --> 00:01:22,878
AND HE WAS LIKE THAT.

45
00:01:22,878 --> 00:01:24,546
NOT TO MENTION ALL OF THE WORDS

46
00:01:24,546 --> 00:01:27,449
AND WISDOM THAT WILL BE HIS

47
00:01:27,449 --> 00:01:31,653
LEGACY ON EVERY ISSUE UNDER THE

48
00:01:31,653 --> 00:01:31,920
SUN.

49
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:33,288
>> Tucker: THOSE THAT KNEW

50
00:01:33,288 --> 00:01:35,657
HIM, ME INCLUDED, WERE SO

51
00:01:35,657 --> 00:01:37,692
TRAINED NOT TO -- HE WANTED TO

52
00:01:37,692 --> 00:01:38,460
DEEMPHASIZE HIS OWN INJURY AND

53
00:01:38,460 --> 00:01:39,861
WANTED TO SHIFT THE ATTENTION

54
00:01:39,861 --> 00:01:42,531
AWAY, NOT JUST FROM THAT, BUT

55
00:01:42,531 --> 00:01:42,964
FROM HIMSELF.

56
00:01:42,964 --> 00:01:44,933
I DON'T THINK I'VE EVER MET

57
00:01:44,933 --> 00:01:45,500
ANYONE LIKE THAT.

58
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:47,402
HE SEEMED TO WANT TO BE JUDGED

59
00:01:47,402 --> 00:01:49,271
ON TELEVISION, CORRECT ME IF I'M

60
00:01:49,271 --> 00:01:51,706
WRONG, ON THE STRENGTH --

61
00:01:51,706 --> 00:01:53,275
>> I THINK YOU'RE RIGHT.

62
00:01:53,275 --> 00:01:54,476
IT TOOK A LONG TIME TO CONVINCE

63
00:01:54,476 --> 00:01:55,477
THEM TO DO THAT SPECIAL WHERE WE

64
00:01:55,477 --> 00:01:57,479
SAT FOR HOURS AND HOURS AND

65
00:01:57,479 --> 00:01:58,680
TALKED ABOUT HIS LIFE.

66
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:00,182
HE, AT FIRST, WAS VERY

67
00:02:00,182 --> 00:02:03,084
UNCOMFORTABLE ABOUT IT.

68
00:02:03,084 --> 00:02:04,319
WHEN HIS BOOK CAME OUT A FEW

69
00:02:04,319 --> 00:02:09,056
YEARS BACK, "THINGS THAT

70
00:02:09,056 --> 00:02:10,258
MATTER," WHICH I RECOMMEND TO

71
00:02:10,258 --> 00:02:11,893
PEOPLE, IT IS AMAZING TO SEE THE

72
00:02:11,893 --> 00:02:13,328
RATINGS IN HIS WAY, WE HAVE A

73
00:02:13,328 --> 00:02:15,230
SPECIAL TOMORROW NIGHT AT

74
00:02:15,230 --> 00:02:16,298
9:00 P.M. THAT ARE HIS WORDS AS

75
00:02:16,298 --> 00:02:19,768
WELL AS THE WORDS OF PEOPLE WHO

76
00:02:19,768 --> 00:02:22,304
REMEMBER HIM, AND I THINK PEOPLE

77
00:02:22,304 --> 00:02:24,306
ARE GOING TO ENJOY LOOKING BACK

78
00:02:24,306 --> 00:02:24,639
AT THAT.

79
00:02:24,639 --> 00:02:25,874
>> Tucker: IN A MOMENT WHERE

80
00:02:25,874 --> 00:02:27,509
EVERYONE WANTS TO TALK ABOUT

81
00:02:27,509 --> 00:02:28,543
THEMSELVES NONSTOP AND THE

82
00:02:28,543 --> 00:02:30,512
CHALLENGES THEY HAVE OVERCOME

83
00:02:30,512 --> 00:02:31,379
AND BLAH, BLAH, BLAH, CHARLES

84
00:02:31,379 --> 00:02:31,880
WAS THE OPPOSITE.

85
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:33,682
HE DID NOT WANT TO TALK ABOUT

86
00:02:33,682 --> 00:02:34,015
HIMSELF.

87
00:02:34,015 --> 00:02:35,951
I DON'T KNOW IF I KNOW ANYONE

88
00:02:35,951 --> 00:02:36,651
ELSE LIKE THAT.

89
00:02:36,651 --> 00:02:38,854
>> WHAT A WONDERFUL QUALITY.

90
00:02:38,854 --> 00:02:40,455
HE SAID THERE WERE SO MANY

91
00:02:40,455 --> 00:02:41,790
ISSUES THAT WE COULD TALK ABOUT,

92
00:02:41,790 --> 00:02:44,492
AND HE DID IT SO WELL.

93
00:02:44,492 --> 00:02:46,328
TUCKER, HE COULD GET TO THE

94
00:02:46,328 --> 00:02:46,962
POINT BETTER THAN ANYBODY.

95
00:02:46,962 --> 00:02:49,664
HE COULD CUT THROUGH THE NOISE.

96
00:02:49,664 --> 00:02:50,899
AND NO MATTER IF YOU AGREED WITH

97
00:02:50,899 --> 00:02:54,236
HIM ARE DISAGREED WITH HIM, HE

98
00:02:54,236 --> 00:02:55,303
WAS SOMEBODY THAT HE COULD JUST

99
00:02:55,303 --> 00:02:56,538
GET TO THE POINT, AND PEOPLE

100
00:02:56,538 --> 00:02:59,474
REALLY APPRECIATED THAT.

101
00:02:59,474 --> 00:03:01,476
THE PANEL DYNAMIC, AS YOU KNOW,

102
00:03:01,476 --> 00:03:05,480

YOU WERE ON THE PANEL MANY TIME.

111
00:03:06,882 --> 00:03:08,650
IT WAS A DISCUSSION, IT WASN'T

112
00:03:08,650 --> 00:03:10,051
PLANNED OUT.

113
00:03:10,051 --> 00:03:10,552
THAT WAS CHARLES.

114
00:03:10,552 --> 00:03:13,288
HE WAS AN OP-ED, ESSENTIALLY,

115
00:03:13,288 --> 00:03:14,689
EVERY TIME HE SAT THERE.

116
00:03:14,689 --> 00:03:15,724
>> Tucker: YEAH.

117
00:03:15,724 --> 00:03:17,492
HE WAS THE AXLE AROUND WHICH IT

118
00:03:17,492 --> 00:03:18,093
REVOLVE.

119
00:03:18,093 --> 00:03:19,494
I DON'T THINK ANYBODY SPEND MORE

120
00:03:19,494 --> 00:00:00,000
TIME ON THE SET WITH HIM THEN
