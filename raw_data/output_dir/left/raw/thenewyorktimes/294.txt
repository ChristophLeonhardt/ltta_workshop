1
00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:14,240
Once upon a time, the devil
laughed with fiendish glee,

2
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:16,400
the gates of hell
stood wide open

3
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:19,760
and damnation lay in
wait for everyone.

4
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:22,160
But this story isn’t
about the devil.

5
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:25,400
It’s about God —
and Martin Luther.

6
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:28,940
Like most Catholics 500
years ago, Luther feared God.

7
00:00:28,940 --> 00:00:32,270
He prayed and prayed,
but his fear persisted.

8
00:00:32,270 --> 00:00:34,100
Luther wondered why.

9
00:00:34,100 --> 00:00:37,400
He brooded long and hard upon
the matter while walking,

10
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:40,470
at church, even on the latrine.

11
00:00:40,470 --> 00:00:41,900
Until it hit him —

12
00:00:41,900 --> 00:00:43,250
“I found it!

13
00:00:43,250 --> 00:00:48,200
God does not hate us, He
loves us,” he rejoiced.

14
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:50,390
“We don’t need to be afraid.

15
00:00:50,390 --> 00:00:53,780
The Church exploits our
fear to enrich itself,”

16
00:00:53,780 --> 00:00:55,550
was his provocative idea.

17
00:00:55,550 --> 00:00:57,740
Out of this idea
grew many others,

18
00:00:57,740 --> 00:01:00,560
and Luther trumpeted
them far and wide.

19
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:02,930
“Such impudence!”
fumed the pope,

20
00:01:02,930 --> 00:01:04,340
when he got wind
of Luther’s views.

21
00:01:04,340 --> 00:01:06,710
His anger was
unsurprising. After all,

22
00:01:06,710 --> 00:01:10,110
the Church had amassed a
fortune selling indulgences.

23
00:01:10,110 --> 00:01:12,560
“What a lousy, no-good monk!”
he cried.

24
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:15,420
“Only the pope possesses
the key to grace.”

25
00:01:15,420 --> 00:01:16,670
Luther protested,

26
00:01:16,670 --> 00:01:21,730
“Only God can bestow grace,
and the pope is a mere man.”

27
00:01:21,730 --> 00:01:22,470
“Recant!

28
00:01:22,470 --> 00:01:25,700
I order you to obey,”
the pope seethed.

29
00:01:25,700 --> 00:01:29,060
“Christians are free and
subservient to no one,”

30
00:01:29,060 --> 00:01:30,290
Luther insisted.

31
00:01:30,290 --> 00:01:32,240
But this went too
far for the pontiff,

32
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:33,820
who now threatened Luther.

33
00:01:33,820 --> 00:01:36,050
“You will be excommunicated!

34
00:01:36,050 --> 00:01:38,030
Your writings will burn.”

35
00:01:38,030 --> 00:01:42,890
“Big deal,” scoffed Luther, as
he heaped ridicule on the pope.

36
00:01:42,890 --> 00:01:45,680
“That’s it,” the pope raged.

37
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:48,650
“This Luther, he
must go,” he cried.

38
00:01:48,650 --> 00:01:50,600
And expelled him
from the church.

39
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:54,020
The emperor too took Luther
to task for his beliefs.

40
00:01:54,020 --> 00:01:56,090
“Take it all back,” he demanded.

41
00:01:56,090 --> 00:01:58,820
“Especially that
nonsense about freedom.”

42
00:01:58,820 --> 00:02:01,490
“That I cannot do,”
Luther replied.

43
00:02:01,490 --> 00:02:05,960
“I must follow my conscience,”
he said in defiance.

44
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:09,020
“How dare you,” the
emperor exclaimed,

45
00:02:09,020 --> 00:02:12,310
and declared Luther an outlaw.

46
00:02:12,310 --> 00:02:14,900
“Wait a minute,” 
the nobility thought.

47
00:02:14,900 --> 00:02:18,170
“Conscience and freedom
aren’t such bad ideas.”

48
00:02:18,170 --> 00:02:20,540
City and municipal officials
also got to thinking.

49
00:02:20,540 --> 00:02:24,210
“If what Luther says
is true,

50
00:02:24,210 --> 00:02:26,540
then the church doesn’t
deserve another penny.

51
00:02:26,540 --> 00:02:30,350
We alone should determine
where our money goes.”

52
00:02:32,690 --> 00:02:35,600
But some Germans took
this concept too far.

53
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:39,470
When a merchant confronted a
noble man for taking his horses

54
00:02:39,470 --> 00:02:42,050
and wanted to burn
down his house,

55
00:02:42,050 --> 00:02:44,780
using Luther’s idea of
freedom as justification,

56
00:02:44,780 --> 00:02:46,730
Luther set the record straight.

57
00:02:46,730 --> 00:02:50,510
“I never spoke of political
freedom,” he said.

58
00:02:50,510 --> 00:02:53,140
“You are free in your
thoughts, yet subjects

59
00:02:53,140 --> 00:02:54,920
you remain, nonetheless.”

60
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:56,930
But it was too late.

61
00:02:56,930 --> 00:02:59,750
People had already embraced
Luther and his ideas

62
00:02:59,750 --> 00:03:01,460
of freedom and conscience.

63
00:03:01,460 --> 00:03:03,920
Even now we honor
him with books,

64
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:07,250
quotes, praises,
exhibitions on his legacy.

65
00:03:07,250 --> 00:03:10,850
The cultural and intellectual
transformation he triggered

66
00:03:10,850 --> 00:00:00,000
remains with us around
the world to this day.
