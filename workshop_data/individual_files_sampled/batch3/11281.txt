hello and welcome to crosstalk where all things are considered I'm Peter LaBelle like a bull in a china shop Donald Trump style and negotiation skills were on full display at this year's annual NATO gathering he was not shy about how he feels about the alliance now the Trump Putin summit is front and center it would be a mere photo-op or something more crosstalking the Trump Putin summit I'm joined by my guess Harold akka Sante in London he is a foreign affairs consultant in analyst in New York we have Charles or tell he is a private investor in writer as well as host of the podcast show Sunday with Charles and in Lake Jackson we have Daniel McAdams he is the executive director of the Ron Paul Institute for peace and prosperity all right gentlemen crosstalk rules in effect that means he can jump in any time you want and I always appreciate Daniel let me go to you first and Lake Jackson let's think about the afterglow of well it was a interesting yes even entertaining to some degree summit of NATO this year I'm not sure if anything really is going to stick because we have like McCrone coming out saying well we talked about budget increases but we didn't agree on anything so I don't know what that yeah we know it was a public display and an in Trump style okay and he left a lasting impression as we go into the Putin Trump summit now where do you think things stand go ahead Daniel well you know Trump said all the right things for the wrong reason you missed a lot of the big points but he exposed one thing that's probably the most important thing to come out of the NATO summit which is that NATO is a racket it's an absolute racket and he exposed that with his comments about Germany Germany if you are so afraid of Russia if Russia is about to invade you why are you enriching them with billions and billions of dollars in trade and not building up your own military he's exposed it for the whole world NATO is a racket and I think that should be the one thing that comes out of the summit I'd really from what's the perspective from London because that's where the president the United States is right now go ahead well in London everyone is concerned with snaring Donald Trump we don't have a serious debate obviously it was two year or two two days ago mr. advert Lucas a former editor of The Economist and had this expose I would say in the BBC saying that we need to stick together because annatto is you know crumbling so the general outlook within the political elite I mean among the politicians in the UK is that they don't know I mean they are scared they are they are scared of you know losing the incentives and and and everything which has been granted to them so far so we as I said before we don't have a serious debate we have accusations blame game but we don't have any serious debate which is lucky and it's exposing what and I agree with Daniel that in in Europe I mean I don't blame Donald Trump they allow him to you know to play on their nose okay I don't blame Donald Trump well yeah I mean I agree with Danny let me go to Charles right now I think a lot of questions that need to be answered were never asked but one thing is for sure Charles Donald Trump was true to his avocation he's a businessman by American weapons by American energy that's his real message it really wasn't about security it was about we want you to buy our stuff here and that was his bottom line Charles go ahead well I also think that there's a lesson in history when NATO was formed Western Europe lay in ruins and the Soviet Union was a gathering threat a very severe gathering threat that was 70 years ago almost and the nation's the big nations in Europe are very wealthy there's speaking it just as an American based in here in New York New York in 1952 was the manufacturing capital of America it was a major exporter today New York laser New York State is a bloated bureaucracy our manufacturing is in ruin and you know we need to spend money we need to encourage investors to spend money here and it absolutely makes no sense across the political spectrum I think in the u.s. to be sending billions and billions of dollars to defend a Germany against you know Russia when Germany seems very interested in promoting Russia's economic interest so it's time to have that grown-up talk and it's ridiculous to wait until 2025 for these rich European nations to foot their share of the bill okay Daniel but the interesting thing for me is that you know and I've said this on this program a number of times NATO exists because it exists they don't have a reason why except for there's a huge bloated and very comfortably paid bureaucracy there everybody gets a cut of the pie and that's why I mean you know Teresa may she might not even be in power this time next week and she told Trump I want you to be tough with Putin okay I mean and that's the only card that she gets to play is that and that's the only way she gets to stay closer to Europe through this brigs a quagmire is to NATO is the Alliance that gels everything together but it's really an emperor with no close argument go ahead Daniel well she she basically got caught in a lie and she's trying to get other people to help lie the way out of it you know she's desperate for for Trump to bring up the scrip affair because you know everything that they said about it has completely been undermined by facts you know the idea that that Putin went over there and poisoned a former a former Russian spy but the fact of the matter is you know the Germans there's a new poll that's out saying that more Germans want Americans to leave than to stay and that is such a significant thing Europe does not feel threatened by Russia at all otherwise they would spend if you had a threatening neighbor next door you may buy a gun you may move you may do something else but if you just sit there and take it then you don't really feel threatened and I think that's the case with with with with dirt with with with Europe and you're right NATO is this big monster that exists to exist it's a bureaucracy they built a big scary claw yeah the claw is our new headquarters I think a cost of billion dollars at least I'm sure are they're expanding into very malevolent areas funding things like the Atlantic Council which does nothing but but to try to destroy journalists who are not on board with the neo-con anti-russia view so it's become a very malevolent anti freedom organization rather than pro-west Pro freedom organization you know and really we're gonna talk about the summit in the second half of the pro but I mean did NATO come off very well after this summit here because like I think we all agree Trump questioned a lot of important things but he didn't question what I think is fundamentally you know the reason why the alliance exists in the first place and it was really quite telling because he he's the one that said well Russia isn't an enemy it's a competitor again this is his mindset this is not the mindset of a buraco military alliance okay they don't have that mindset because you know Trump won you know in the West they build weapons to make money it's a business a country like Russia builds primarily weapons for defense it doesn't mean they go don't go out on the road and sell them but primarily it's for defense go ahead in London yes but first of all we have to understand that NATO and in is a huge business for many people so the NATO industry anti-russia industry is it is a glue which which is sticking together the Western nations so that's why we are seeing this fear and and and the sense of insecurity among among the elites and as you rightly said and what a World Cup 2018 in Moscow proved is that people are not afraid I mean ordinary people are not afraid of Russians many citizens from all over the world came to Russia and they were pleased with what they saw in in in Moscow in in in Russia all together so it is as daniel said Rodney said is this 47% of of German populace which is unwilling to have the you know US troops on their soil it is only 35 or 34 which is still willing to to have US troops on all on German soil so if you talk to the you know regular people were even in Poland in Czech Republic in France they are not scared of front of Russia excuse me it is only the elites who those who are you know participating and and you know profiting from from from stigmatizing Russia are afraid because what they are going to do and you know whole anti-russia business will collapse yes where they are going fine fine fine work and Rousseau phobia anti-russia it's it's a it's also a racket okay I mean you could never be you can say anything what you want about Russia and be completely wrong and you'll never be punished for it Charles let me just let me jump in let me just yeah let me just say what one quick thing if you happen to have a Eastern European ancestry and and and and you are willing to smear Russia you earn a lot of money yeah I remember when I arrived six years ago to this country and I've started to be working as a researcher in a House of Commons I remember and I will not tell the sir the name of the person but I was assured that if I'm going to participate in this hood spa if I'm going to participate only on the merit of the fact that I'm coming from the Eastern Europe I will earn a lot of money so it it tells a lot about the industry yeah you know absolutely you know Charles I mean again I mean kind of looking at Trump's mindset and in the there's a souther issue of trade that's on the margin right now is in this conversation is that you know Trump sees that the United States was very generous in helping rebuild Europe for geopolitical reasons it wasn't just generosity okay and now you have a very rich continent sure it has a lot of problems a lot of the problems are self induced okay and if they're not happy with the United States as a leader of NATO why don't they have their own defence Alliance they're not poor they have to have technology they have people oh but then again nobody wants to join the German army and I heard there's like only about 12 tanks that run I mean really this is there it's not a military alliance it's a propaganda alliance go ahead Charles yeah and I think it really needs to be reimagined and repurposed I mean if you look at it at NATO it was effective from 49 until 92 but then after the Soviet Union went away you know what if what does NATO really been doing and is there a need for an alliance of this group of Nations to pursue missions internationally or not or should it be a different group emissions the simple fact is it rightly or wrongly United States over time has spent a lot of money on military and has you know our military has sadly a lot of experience fighting around the world so of course you know if you're gonna ally with somebody you want to think about aligned with the United States military I just think this alliance is another at this point globalist bureaucracy that is not regulated properly that is not serving a clear mission and you know I don't see the strong argument for the US taxpayer which is sorely indebted at over 21 trillion dollars at this point to be throwing money obligation show the money building a wall that's what they need to do take that money and build a wall gentlemen we're gonna go to a short break and after that short break we'll continue our discussion on the Trump Putin summit stay with our team welcome back to crop stock where all things are considered I'm Peter LaBelle to remind you we're discussing the Trump Putin summit okay let me go back to Daniel in in Lake Jackson what are you expecting from this summit because you know I've read all of the think tank stuff and you know the I think it kind of kind of low octane journalism on it and everything I don't think this can be a lot accomplished unfortunately right now primarily I'll be really honest is that I don't think considering Trump's foreign policy vision and behavior and words it's good to be more kind of another show because with his the problems back home that he has I don't think that he has he can follow up on anything he really wants to do he's going to be he's cornered in so many ways what do you think Daniel well you know Peter I rarely disagree with you but in this situation I may disagree with you a bit because I think it's ignore misleading if only for the fact we talked about this before the show as much as as Trump frustrates us and drives us crazy his detractors are so much worse yes we sometimes find ourselves feeling like we're in his corner so the fact that the neo cons are freaking out over this the resistors are so-called resistence types are freaking out over this a lot of the US Congress is completely freaking out over this I think it will be an absent even if nothing comes out of it just the visuals of him and Putin shaking hands smiling I bet the two get along on a personal level pretty well right that's going to send shivers down the spines of the bad guys here at home so in that case there's it's a no-lose for for Trump and for Americans anyway let me go back to you and one daniel is right in the sense that all the criticism that he's going to get at this Helsinki summit it's already baked in I mean I can't imagine a worse thing you can say about Donald Trump that hasn't been said for the last two years okay so it's already baked in I think he likes to go them too in the media but I mean get into but for substance here I mean I hear all this talk and I again I think it's kind of low octane intelligence you know they're gonna make this grand deal on Siri and all that I don't think that's really the case I don't at all because I don't think because I mean the brush have been really smart visa V Syria I mean they're there for very specific purposes are not there to confront the West or you know some other grander plan no they're not okay oh they're gonna tell the Iranians to get out of Syria well I don't think that's gonna happen either all right and then there's the issue that I think all of us would like to be resolved and it won't be as Ukraine and I don't think Donald Trump really cares about Ukraine all right so I mean again I mean kind of agreeing with Daniel I mean just the meeting itself is sends a lot of signals you could just interpret whatever you want that's what we get with Trump Trump's a prism whatever the angle you start you'll get a different look go ahead and in London go ahead well I do agree with Daniel was saying that there Donald Trump detractors are much worse but my approach is strictly geopolitical in my opinion the meeting will be strictly orientational they will obviously they will present their views on a certain on the senton issues around the world and as you rightly said there's a you know deadlock with regards to the Urich Ukrainian farce I would say because I'm paying very close attention from the very beginning what is happening in Ukraine we kill and it happened that a loss I mean yesterday and it was the commemoration of the genocide in Virginia in Easter in eastern part of Poland where you Stefan Bandera and and others were slaughtering poles and Jews and well my wife is happening to - coming from this part of Poland so we can see that but poroshenko is not interested with fulfilling the me means agreements he's pursuing a strictly right-wing fight of fascist anti-semitic movements and supporting in in his country and even Atlantic Council write an article or report yes saying obviously that this is not the headline from the RT so we know that everything is sleep sleeping you know from their hands with regards to Ukraine because well we nearly the Ukraine is is will have the same situation as we have in the Middle East so it is very very warring obviously Donald Trump is pushed by Netanyahu in Israel and yesterday I had very interesting conversation with my friends from Israel and Netanyahu push Donald trum and today he's in Moscow so he also will be pushing President Putin with regards to Iran and I assume that they will require or they will ask the president put in to somehow facilitate they withdraw from the I mean Iranian units from Syria but in my opinion what Russia can agree to do is to agree to be a security broker between Iran and Israel and I think that is more and that is the role that has been playing okay and I think it's a very wise role Russia can talk to everybody in the region okay Charles you know what again you know IIIi saw it before his European trip trump hat was on the campaign trail he was out talking to his base he he loves that and the base loves it I sometimes think he's saying we're gonna get along with Putin and so he's gonna have a visual he's gonna have a photo op and then when he goes back to deluge and he goes had to particles like see see I told you I would meet him and I did it okay I came to think so much of this is for his base and it's domestically driven I everything he does he does for his base the appointment of the Supreme Court justice okay for the base okay so I mean Charles is this more really about domestic politics than geopolitics go ahead Charles no I don't think so at all I think in this case there's a clear record now as Donald Trump as president he always has his eye on the deal author of the art of the deal he's so the deal to be had here I think and I'm not saying that it'll be concluded at this meeting the deal to drive towards is a deal where Russia is more than an honest broker is an active participant the United States has moved very aggressively to try to get the Sunni states to reject radical Islam we have limited influence in Iran but the Iranian economy has done very little for the average Iranian since 1979 and it stands in tremendous economy and perception of death government this is not our business if iranian government is not well enough for iranians is up to them Charles go ahead perhaps yeah perhaps but I'm just sorry about the outlines of a deal here so if if one is looking to broker a lasting peace in the Middle East which I do believe the Trump administration would love to do on the one hand that's a dream that we have it may be a naive and foolish dream but it's a dream on the other hand in in Russia it's under sanction yes it may be doing pretty well under sanctions but it's better to be out from sanctions than understand sure I'm following your argument because if you're talking about sanction relief well it's it's a principle of the Russian Foreign Ministry Russia will never ask for the end of sanctions because they don't believe they're legitimate no evidence has been proven shown to the public whatsoever of all of the allegations that are made now one shred of evidence so Russia is not going to ask for the end of the sanctions all right so that's not on the table at all okay go ahead Charles well if I could just jump back yeah so so my point is it's at some points in with deals and I cut my background actually is not like Trump is a deal maker but doing deals at some point the arguments don't matter and I think that's where we're at it doesn't matter who asked for it doesn't matter the diplomatic light nice and sees you know there it would be better for the sanctions to be removed you for the it's Congress that does that Congress has to vote to resend them you know what Charles they will never resend them okay and that's baked in here in Moscow they know that's not going to happen all right okay let me go to Daniel here Daniel I mean I think what what we heard from London a New Year kind of puts everything in into the mix right the thing is is that I don't know what Trump can deliver on guys I don't know if what he could deal around that Putin wants go ahead Daniel well I would just comment on the whole idea of the Trump administration wanting to broker Middle East peace I'm not sure that is the focus I think that's much too strategic of a focus for the Trump administration which i think is really sort of Bob bogged down in tactical approaches to the world and I think that's the reason why he likes to break through and have a personal meeting with Kim and now a personal meeting with Trump which of course terrifies his advisers you know there was a co deal there was a group of US senators who went to Russia recently yes and just going to showing to prove that the worst thing to get information is on a Codell because it's sort of a great exercising groupthink and bubble mentality they all came back and showed they had look earned absolutely nothing from their time in Russia I think it was Shelby from Alabama that said that well Trump better study Stalin if he wants to understand how to deal with Putin you know I mean it's just these absurdities Lindsey Graham is out there tweeting his little fingers off about how we've got to stay in Syria forever and and Trump understand up to Putin but here's the thing that's interesting all of the retweets all of the comments they're all from the left they're all from the resister people and you touched on it earlier Peter when Trump talks about getting along with Russia his base still does cheer yeah you do have a part of the right-wing that has this enemy mentality so you do have this sort of problem but his base likes that he was elected on it his numbers are high because of it so he has the most important vote of confidence going into this meeting which is the people that will vote for him if he runs for re-election are not going to be bothered at all if there's a great visual of two tough guys let's be honest yeah shaking hands smiling so it's it's it's a win-win again as I said earlier for and if you look at the Putin's base and you look at Trump's base both like that picture okay exactly no I did with Daniel here I mean again I mean even CNN I noticed the last few days they even admitted they even admitted that the the the American people on the whole are not interested in Russia gate at all they they don't know much that they don't follow it and they just kind of kind of push it out of their mind because it doesn't mean much of them it certainly does to the resistance people let's go back to London last word is it going to be a thumbs up or a thumbs down with a summit 20 seconds well it'll be middle finger down but we can all agree that the relation maybe not relationships but the contact between two great powers has to improve has to improve because we are in very dangerous situation and I hope they believe that neither of both sides want to you know have this conflict you know escalate further so we have to you know well one being okay that's all the time we have gentlemen but one thing is you're sure it'll be a great photo-op no no doubt about that that's all the time we have gentlemen many thanks to my guest in New York London and in Lake Jackson and thanks to our viewers for watching us here at RT see you next time and remember crosstalk trolls
