THIS IS A SENSITIVE ISSUE, PARTICULARLY WITH CHINA. Dana: JOHN, THANK YOU FOR THE ROBERT. WE APPRECIATE IT. THE NORTH KOREANS INVITING A SMALL GROUP OF FOREIGN JOURNALISTS TO WITNESS A DESTRUCTION OF THE PRIMARY NUCLEAR TEST SITE. MILITARY ANALYSTS LIKE GENERAL JACK KEANE REMAIN SKEPTICAL. GIVEN A WIDELY HELD VIEW THAT THIS NUCLEAR TEST SITE COLLAPSED AS A RESULT OF THE THEY CONDUCTED BACK IN DECEMBER, THAT IT IS PROBABLY A P.R. STUNT. THEREFORE, THE SITE IS NOT USABLE ANYWAY AND THEY ARE TRYING TO ADVERTISE IT THAT THEY ARE DISMANTING THE NUCLEAR DISMANTLING THE NUCLEAR TEST SITE TO DEMONSTRATE THEY’RE SERIOUS ABOUT DENUCLEARIZATION. Dana: DENNIS WILDER IS PROFESSOR OF ASIAN STUDIES AT GEORGETOWN UNIVERSITY AND THE FORMER DIRECTOR OF EAST ASIAN AFFAIRS AT THE NATIONAL SECURITY COUNCIL. I AM GLAD YOU ARE HERE TODAY. YOU ARE THE PERFECT GUEST ON THE PERFECT DAY TO TALK ABOUT IT. YOU KNOW EACH OF THE COUNTRIES INDIVIDUALLY BUT YOU LOOK AT THE REGION OF A WHOLE AND YOU KNOW THE UNITED STATES POSITION. SO LET ME GIVE YOU THE FLOOR TO GIVE ME YOUR IMPRESSIONS AFTER THE PRESIDENT’S MEETING TODAY WITH THE PRESIDENT OF SOUTH KOREA IN THE OVAL OFFICE. I THINK THE PRESIDENT IS MAKING SOME VERY SMART MOVES HERE TO BE CAREFUL ABOUT THE SUMMIT. THE NORTH KOREANS CLEARLY ARE FEELING THEIR OATS A BIT AND THEY ARE GOING BACK TO THE OLD STYLE. IN PART, THE PRESIDENT IS RIGHT. BECAUSE XI JINPING HAS STARTED TO TALK ABOUT THE ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT WITH THE NORTH AND THE NORTH IS FEELING LIKE THEY HAVE THEIR BACK COVERED BY THE CHINESE. SO NOW THE PRESIDENT WATCHING THAT IS REALIZING THAT HE HAS TO PUT THE PRESSURE BACK ON THE CHINESE AND ON THE NORTH KOREANS. SO WHAT HE IS SAYING IS WHAT WE SHOULD BE SAYING, WHICH IS HEY, WE WILL HAVE THIS MEETING IF THE TERMS ARE RIGHT. IF THE TERMS AREN’T RIGHT, WE CAN WAIT. ONE THING IN THE PAST WE HAVE SEEN IS THE AMERICAN NEGOTIATORS WITH THE NORTH KOREANS TOO EAGER TO FIND A WAY TO GET A DEAL. WHEN WE DO THAT, THEY TAKE US FOR A RIDE AND THEY HAVE TAKEN US FOR SEVERAL RIDES IN THE PAST. I THINK THE PRESIDENT IS SIGNALS GO AHEAD. Dana: I WANT TO ASK YOU ABOUT THE SOUTH KOREANS. BECAUSE IN THIS SCENARIO IT SEEMS LIKE THEY ARE VERY EAGER AND TODAY IN THE "WASHINGTON POST" THERE WAS AN OP-ED BY THE SACKEN AMBASSADOR SOUTH KOREAN AMBASSADOR OF THE UNITED STATES. "WE CANNOT AFFORD TO LOSE HOPE THAT KIM MAY CHOOSE A OR HIS GRANDFATHER, UNLIKE IN THE PAST. WE HAVE SEEN AND ARE ABOUT TO SEE DIPLOMATIC ACTIONS ON THE HIGHEST LEVEL AMONG THE MAIN COUNTRIES INVOLVED." WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THE DYNAMIC OF WHAT THE SOUTH KOREANS WANT AND WHAT THE CHINESE WANT AND THE PRESIDENT SAYING LOOK, I’M NOT COMING OVER THERE, I’M NOT GOING TO WASTE MY TIME AND FLY TO SINGAPORE FOR NOTHING. BUT THE SOUTH KOREANS ARE KEEN TO GET THIS DONE. I WAS ACTUALLY GLAD THAT THE NORTH KOREANS IF YOU WILL POPPED THE BUBBLE OF THE SOUTH KOREANS A LITTLE BIT BY REFUSING TO HAVE THE MEETINGS AND BY REFUSING TO HAVE THE SOUTH KOREAN REPORTER GOES TO THE TEST SITE. I THINK SOUTH KOREA WAS GETTING WAY OUT ON ITS SKIS ON THIS. AND WAY TOO BELIEVING THAT THERE IS A CHANGE IN NORTH KOREA. I DO THINK KIM 3.0 IS DIFFERENT THAN THE KIM 2.0 AND 1.0. HE DID STUDY IN SWITZERLAND. HE IS INTERNET SAVVY. I THINK HE IS THINKING IF HE GOT THE RIGHT DEAL FOR HIS PEOPLE THERE IS THE POSSIBILITY THAT HE WOULD GIVE UP THE NUCLEAR WEAPONS. I’M NOT AS CONVINCED AS SOME PEOPLE HE WOULD NEVER GIVE THEM UP. Dana: BUT IT IS DIFFERENT FOR HIM IN THAT HE HAS THE NUCLEAR WEAPONS. THE TWO PREVIOUS KIMS DID NOT. RIGHT. Dana: LET ME ASK ABOUT ONE OTHER THING, CHINA. THE PRESIDENT TALKED ABOUT THAT BEFORE I LET YOU GO. I WANT YOU TO LISTEN TO THIS BECAUSE THE PRESIDENT WAS OBVIOUSLY AS JOHN ROBERTS REPORTED NOT THAT HAPPY WITH HOW CHINA MAY HAVE WEIGHED IN HERE. LISTEN. President Trump: NO, NOT REALLY. I THINK THAT THEY’RE A START. BUT WE NEED SOMETHING. LOOK. CHINA HAS BEEN I REALLY CALL IT A "DERELICTION OF DUTIES" TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF US ON TRADE THE WAY WE HAVE BEEN TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF. CHINA HAS AN EXAMPLE HAS MADE A FORTUNE. I MEAN A TRANSFER OF WEALTH LIKE NOBODY HAS SEEN IN HISTORY. THEY ARE THE BIG ONE. THEY ARE ALMOST ALL BAD BUT CHINA IS THE BIG ONE. I’M NOT SATISFIED BUT WE WILL SEE WHAT HAPPENS. Dana: TELL ME WHAT YOU THINK ABOUT THAT, DENNIS. THESE TRADE NEGOTIATIONS ARE TOUGH. IT’S BETWEEN THE WORLD TWO LARGEST MASSIVE ECONOMIES. NOW THE CHINESE I THINK ARE COMING IN TRYING TO LOW BALL THE UNITED STATES. I THINK THE PRESIDENT’S RIGHT TO SAY WE ARE NOT GOING TO TAKE CRUMBS OFF THE TABLE AGAIN. YOU HAVE DONE WELL OFF THE MARKETS. YOU DO WELL EVERY YEAR OFF THE MARKET. WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO GIVE US IN RETURN AND HOW DO WE MAKE IT A FAIR RECIPROCAL RELATIONSHIP? HE CAME AND PUT A FEW THINGS ON THE TABLE. MORE AGRICULTURAL PURPOSES AND MORE L&G PURCHASES FROM THE UNITED STATES. BUT THEY DIDN’T TALK ABOUT THE STRUCTURAL CHANGE IN THE RELATIONSHIP THAT NEEDS TO HAPPEN. SO AMERICAN COMPANIES GET A FAIR SHAKE AND THE AMERICAN WORKER GETS A FAIR SHAKE. THAT WHAT NEEDS TO HAPPEN. Dana: JOHN ROBERTS ASKED THE PRESIDENT AND THE PRESIDENT SAID HE THINKS WHETHER THE MEETING TAKES PLACE ON JUNE 12 IS A CON FLIP, 50/50. WHAT DO YOU PUT IT? I THINK ITS A LITTLE HIGHER.
