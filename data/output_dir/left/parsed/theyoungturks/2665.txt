MCCLATCHY NEWSPAPERS HAS AN
AMAZING ARTICLE ABOUT THE NRA
AND HOW THEY MIGHT HAVE TAKEN
MONEY FROM THE RUSSIANS AND
SPENT IT ON TRUMP.
LET'S DIVE IN.
THIS 
PART IS NOT
IN DISPUTE THE NRA ALSO AGREES
TO THAT.
MCCLATCHY HAS A COUPLE SOURCES
THAT ARE INSIDE THE NRA SAYING
THEY MIGHT HAVE SPENT $70
MILLION OR MORE IN THE ELECTION.
BUT SINCE THEY DON'T HAVE TO
DISCLOSE THEIR DONORS AND A
LOT OF THIS IS DARK MONEY IS
HARD TO FERRET THAT OUT.
IF YOU SAY IT'S NOT THAT BIG A
DEAL THAT THEY SUPPORTED TRUMP A
LOT MORE THAN ROMNEY, NUMBER ONE
THEY HAVE MORE DARK MONEY AS
THINGS GO ALONG.
FOR GUNOWNERS HE HAD THAT
HILARIOUS LINE WHERE HE SAID
THAT HE HUNTS VERMIN.
I THINK THE SYSTEM OF ALLOWING
MONEY IN POLITICS IS INSANE.
I THINK YOU NEED TO GET ALL
THAT MONEY OUT.
FOREIGN MONEY 
IS ILLEGAL.
THAT IS A WHOLE DIFFERENT CUP
OF TEA.
IF THEY TOOK MONEY AND THEY
SPENT FOREIGN MONEY IN THE
ELECTIONS THAT IS A CLEAR
VIOLATION OF THE LAW AND IT
SHOULD HAVE SEVERE CONSEQUENCES.
WHAT IS AMAZING ABOUT THIS STORY
IS THE NRA AT THE TIME STILL
NOT COMMENTING.
BUT TO NOT COMMENT AT ALL AND TO
NOT DENY IT THAT IS FASCINATING.
HE 
IS APPARENTLY AN NRA MEMBER
AND HAS BEEN FOR A WHILE.
HE SET UP HIS OWN VERSION OF GUN
GROUP IN RUSSIA AND THEN HE CAN
SAY LOOK MAYBE HE IS JUST
INTERESTED IN GUNS.
A RUSSIAN DOING MONEY LAUNDERING
CONNECTED TO TRUMP, WELL I
WOULD NEVER.
MORE ON THIS.
IF THE NRA TAKES
MONEY FROM A GUY INVOLVED IN
MONEY LAUNDERING AND CRIMINAL
ACTIVITIES, FIRST OF ALL THAT IN
ITSELF IS INTERESTING,
NOTEWORTHY, EVEN IF THEY DIDN'T
SPEND IT IN POLITICS.
WHAT ARE THEY DOING SPENDING
MONEY FROM A RUSSIAN GODFATHER.
ARE THEY ALSO ALLOWED TO TAKE
MONEY FROM MEXICAN DRUG CARTELS?
ARE THEY ALLOWED TO TAKE MONEY
FROM CHINESE OR JAPANESE GANGS?
SO THE NRA SHOULD 
JUST TAKE
MONEY FROM THEM?
THAT WOULD BE A PR ISSUE AND IF
YOU ASK ME NOT THE RIGHT THING
TO DO.
THEY ARE SUPPOSED TO BE
REPRESENTING AMERICANS WHO CARE
ABOUT THE SECOND AMERICAN NOT
FOREIGN THUGS STOP BUT WHEN YOU
SPEND IT IN POLITICS IS ILLEGAL.
BY THE WAY DANA ROHRBACHER WHO
IS SO OBVIOUSLY IN THE TANK FOR
RUSSIA GOES OUT THERE AND DOES
PROPAGANDA FOR THEM OVER AND
OVER AGAIN.
AND OTHER REPUBLICANS SAY
ROHRBACHER IS PUTTING 
FAVORITE
REPUBLICAN.
GEE I WONDER WHY?
WHEN YOU PUT ALL THIS TOGETHER,
REMEMBER 
THE BACKGROUND.
PART OF THAT DRIVE WAS TO FUNNEL
TENS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS INTO
AMERICAN GROUPS LIKE THE NRA
WHICH THEN SPENT IT AS DARK
MONEY IN POLITICS.
IF THEY CAN PROVE THAT THEN THEY
SHOULD BE ARRESTED AND EVERYONE-
AND IF THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN KNEW
ABOUT IT THEY SHOULD ALSO
BE ARRESTED.
THESE ARE VERY SERIOUS ISSUES.
WITH THE SAUDI'S COME IN AND SAY
NICE WORK RUSSIANS, 10 MILLION?
I HAVE $10 BILLION, I AM JUST
GOING TO BUY THE NEXT PRESIDENT.
HE NOW WORKS FOR THE SAUDIS.
WHAT IS THE CHINESE DO THAT?
OUR SYSTEM IS INSANE.
WE ALLOW FOR UNLIMITED MONEY AND
IT GOES TO INDEPENDENT
EXPENDITURES AND CAMPAIGN
CONTRIBUTIONS.
THEY JUST BUY ALL OF OUR
POLITICIANS.
NOW WE HAVE DARK MONEY SO WE
DON'T KNOW WHERE THE MONEY COMES
FROM SO WHAT STOPS ANY FOREIGN
GOVERNMENT OR FOREIGN CRIME
ORGANIZATION FROM OUTSIDE THE
COUNTRY OF SIMPLY COMING IN
AND GIVING DARK MONEY AND
BUYING OUR POLITICIANS.
THIS SYSTEM IS INSANE.
YOU WANT TO TALK ABOUT
RIGGED, THIS IS RATE.
YOU KNOW WHAT I THINK YOU SHOULD
DO, WOLF Ã± PAC.COM.
IN THE CASE OF FOREIGN MEDDLING
IN OUR ELECTIONS AND GIVING
MONEY THAT GOES TO CAMPAIGNS,
THEY SHOULD BE PUT IN PRISON,
LOCK THEM UP.
THAT IS A CLEAR VIOLATION OF
THE LAW.
AND VOX REPORTS TODAY THE NRA IS
NOT RESPONDING TO PRESS
INQUIRIES.
IF YOU DIDN'T DO IT YOU CAN
EASILY SAY THAT IS NOT TRUE.
BUT YOU CAN AT LEAST DENY IT,
THEY HAVE NOT DENIED IT.
THAT IS UNBELIEVABLE.
