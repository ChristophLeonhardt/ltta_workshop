2
00:00:01,970 --> 00:00:06,770
We are being run by
incompetent people, people that

3
00:00:06,770 --> 00:00:09,150
don’t know what they’re doing.

4
00:00:09,150 --> 00:00:10,430
I have the best people.

5
00:00:10,430 --> 00:00:12,040
I have the best people.

6
00:00:12,040 --> 00:00:13,490
I have the best people.

7
00:00:13,490 --> 00:00:14,330
Believe me.

8
00:00:20,595 --> 00:00:21,390
You’re fired.

9
00:00:23,345 --> 00:00:23,990
You’re fired.

10
00:00:25,970 --> 00:00:26,969
Go home.

11
00:00:26,987 --> 00:00:28,070
He slayed all the dragons.

12
00:00:31,136 --> 00:00:32,031
You’re all fired.

13
00:00:32,031 --> 00:00:33,630
All four are fired.

14
00:00:33,880 --> 00:00:36,193
Ultimately, the best messenger
is the president himself.

15
00:00:36,193 --> 00:00:36,910
You’re fired.

16
00:00:36,910 --> 00:00:37,600
I’m on Team Trump.

17
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:38,160
You’re fired.

18
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:39,190
I love the president.

19
00:00:39,190 --> 00:00:39,540
You’re fired.

20
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:41,180
The president of the United
States is a great man.

21
00:00:41,180 --> 00:00:41,680
You’re fired.

22
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:43,840
Somebody has to be the
president’s pit bull.

23
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:45,290
That’s so stupid for you to say,

24
00:00:45,290 --> 00:00:46,190
you’re fired.

25
00:00:46,190 --> 00:00:47,660
Tom, you’re fired.

26
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:52,658
Every critic will have to
bow down to President Trump.

27
00:00:52,658 --> 00:00:53,934
You’re fired.

28
00:00:53,934 --> 00:00:00,000
