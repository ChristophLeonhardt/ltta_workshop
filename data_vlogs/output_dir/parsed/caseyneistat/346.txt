what music is that hi here
morning
in case you missed yesterday's episode
Oscar and I got upgraded to these
first-class Suites they're basically
like many apartments in the sky
it's started incredible
I just sleep the Oscar
like a prince god works
senator pleasure having work today enjoy
your day is New York or arrows your
arrows may take me Roberta seen in a
vision 30 minutes the landing
he's sad to leave the plane Oscar so
really really really
play live I thank you very much thank
you provide back in New York City try to
get back to the city
so we left that morning run just want to
reiterate again that was my all-time
greatest airplane seat ever she tucked
me in this is not a paid advertisement
this is not a Peter did you say she
tucked you in while feeding you cheese
she tucked me in and then he sees me
solo it Oscar I'll see you in the office
in about an hour amazing trip Thanks you
want a Jolly Rancher this guy's got an
incredible supply I got a strawberry
coming at ya
did you miss me
did the baby miss me I came home just to
get changed and stuff but I'm like so
groggy from only sleeping for two hours
on a plane I think I'm gonna go for a
run it's so hot it's so hot it's high
noon high noon pure Sun no wind so ha ha
ha there's a severe heat warning today
heat advisory today in New York City so
it's like it's like danger hot out there
I don't have a boosted board I left them
all at the office I feel like I'm
marooned on a desert island without a
boat or a paddle walking is the most
inefficient means of getting around this
city
no more cheeseburgers you must be so
sick of me saying that number one it
sure does still going to be back in this
studio number two well look see this see
this severe injury here I'm not going to
go as far as to say this is
life-threatening but that is a pretty
serious wound please but a scratch a
scratch the arms off that wound was
inflicted by my iPad see here's what
happens this is my official drone iPad
is the one that I got for free and all
right all those times that I'm on my
skateboard and flying the drone at the
same time I fall most of the time and
slowly but surely these cracks have
turned into like this life-threatening
wound here I don't know how this thing
still works look it there's literally a
hole so this is part of the reason why
there hasn't been as much drone action
in these vlogs as of late I'm going to
take this and see if I can get it
truly remarkable how often just leave
them forget the damn camera
how long do we have until it starts
raining this guess two minutes yeah you
better get there hurry up
amid the Apple store it's not raining
that was thunder shoot man
question you guys know here I come
okay I'm just straight up chickening out
on this whole mission he said there was
like are you doing a fairly substantial
charge and it's about to start pouring
out and there was a line maybe I'll come
back mission
are you getting an emergency alert on
your phone for the storm yeah just got
an emergency alert I gotta get back to
the studio really pushing it trying to
get a smoothie
did you get that warning
full speed full speed back to the office
it's about to get bad
i-i'll of a good storm I don't want to
miss this one I'm gonna be more prepared
I'm putting on some foul weather gear I
got some pink flip-flops all right
I'm going out switching over to go wait
nothing's getting through this
I mean that was a pretty serious
rainstorm but they said a hail I didn't
see any hail Cantus offered to come pick
me up hope that offer still stands
definitely not boosted board whether
this is sort of an impromptu male time
I'd like to say thank you to red kin for
sending me this towel I would also like
to thank time unique for sending me this
sweet sweatshirt without your generous
mail time packages I'd be both wet and
cold right now
oh yeah yeah leaving the office slightly
damped
I guess holy smokes it's raining out huh
scary
lightning scared of lightning
you are blocking the entirety of the
Westside it is completely your know
you're supposed to wait behind the line
that guy was supposed to turn right
