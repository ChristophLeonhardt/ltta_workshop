THE BBC HAS REPORTED
THAT A SENIOR UKRAINIAN OFFICIAL
DISCLOSED THAT MICHAEL COHEN WAS
PAID AS MUCH AS $600,000 TO
CREATE A BACK CHANNEL TO TRUMP
BY THE UKRAINIAN OFFICIAL.
THE
UKRAINIAN PRESIDENT WANTED TO
MEET WITH TRUMP, HE WANTED MORE
THAN JUST A PHOTO OP, AND THE
BEST WAY TO DO THAT WAS TO GO
THROUGH TRUMP'S FIX-IT LAWYER
MICHAEL COHEN.
NOW --
THIS IS JUNE OF LAST YEAR.
NOW --
BUT 
WE DO KNOW THAT THE
UKRAINIAN DID HAVE A MEETING
WITH TRUMP AND THAT WAS
SOMETHING MORE THAN JUST A PHOTO
OP, WHICH IS WHAT HE WAS LOOKING
FOR.
MICHAEL COHEN IS NOT A
REGISTERED REPRESENTATIVE OF
UKRAINE SO THIS IS DEFINITELY,
DEFINITELY ILLEGAL.
IF THEY CAN
PROVE IT. AND WE WILL SEE IF
THEY CAN.
BUT MY GUESS IS THEY
HAVE ALL OF HIS DOCUMENTS AND
HIS BANK ACCOUNTS, SO IT WOULD
BE RELATIVELY EASY TO PROVE.
IN
FACT THE BANKS ARE THE ONES THAT
FIRST FLAG MICHAEL COHEN, THEY
ARE LIKE, LOTS OF SHADY BUSINESS
GOING ON HERE, HE SET UP THIS
THING CALLED ESSENTIAL
CONSULTANTS, SAID IT WOULD JUST
HANDLE SMALL CHECKS, IT HANDLED
LARGE CHECKS.
BY THE WAY IF YOU
DON'T KNOW, IF YOU HAVE
TRANSACTIONS OVER $10,000 THAT
LOOK SUSPICIOUS THE BANK DOES
FLAG IT, THEY HAD FLAGS ALL OVER
MICHAEL COHEN'S PERSONAL AND
BUSINESS ACCOUNTS, ESSENTIAL
CONSULTANTS, THAT'S THE THING HE
USED TO PAY OFF STORMY DANIELS
FOR DONALD TRUMP, NOW IT HAS LED
TO AMONG DIFFERENT REVELATIONS
THIS ONE.
NOW, IF TRUMP DIDN'T
KNOW ABOUT IT, THEN HE'S NOT
GUILTY OF THAT AT ALL.
THAT IS
AN IF, WE DON'T KNOW THAT, THERE
IS NO EVIDENCE OF IT, SO LET'S
LEAVE IT ASIDE.
THE REASON THIS
IS SO IMPORTANT IS AGAIN IF
MICHAEL COHEN IS DEFINITELY
GOING AWAY, AND FOR SOMETHING
LIKE THIS, THIS IS A LAYUP, THEN
HE'S GOT A CHOICE TO MAKE, HOW
MANY YEARS IN PRISON WHAT I LIKE
TO SERVE TO TRY TO COVER FOR
DONALD TRUMP?
NOW, IT'S POSSIBLE
THAT MICHAEL COHEN HAS GOT
NOTHING ON DONALD TRUMP, THAT
DONALD TRUMP HAS BEEN OPERATING
HIS BUSINESS LEGALLY FOR ALL
THIS TIME AND NEVER BROKEN THE
LAWS.
 YEAH, I SUPPOSE
THAT IS POSSIBLE, RIGHT?
BUT IF
MICHAEL COHEN HAS ANYTHING, NOT
EVEN THIS, BUT ANYTHING ELSE ON
DONALD TRUMP, HE COULD TRADE IT
FOR LENIENCY ON AN ISSUE LIKE
THIS.
RIGHT.
THERE ARE TWO THINGS
LEFT TO DISCUSS IN THIS STORY,
HOW DID THIS WHOLE BACK CHANNEL
WORK, AND THE MORE IMPORTANTLY
WHAT CONCESSIONS WERE EXCHANGED
AFTER THIS MEETING?
LET'S START
WITH THE BACK CHANNEL.
SO
POROSHENKO, UKRAINIAN PRESIDENT
--
AGAIN, AS CENK MENTIONED,
COHEN SETTING UP THESE
MEETINGS AND TAKING PAYMENTS TO
SET UP THE MEETINGS IS ILLEGAL
BECAUSE --
OKAY, SO WHAT HAPPENED AFTER
THE MEETING THAT TOOK PLACE LAST
JUNE BETWEEN THE UKRAINIAN
PRESIDENT AND TRUMP?
WELL --
WELL, THAT IS A LUCKY BREAK
FOR THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN TEAM THAT
INCLUDES MANAFORT.
WHAT AN
UNREAL COINCIDENCE.
BUT I'M SURE
IT'S A COINCIDENCE.
WHAT ELSE
HAPPENED?
SO THAT'S AN INTERESTING
LITTLE TIDBIT IN THE STORY.
IT'S A QUICK ASIDE, THAT'S WHY
I LAUGHED WHEN I SAID THE IDEA
THAT TRUMP DOESN'T HAVE ANYTHING
ILLEGAL IN HIS BUSINESS DEALINGS
WAS HILARIOUS, HE DID BUSINESS
WITH GUYS LIKE FELIX SATER ALL
THE TIME, SATER CUT SOME GUY'S
FACE OPEN AND GOT IN TROUBLE
WITH THE LAW ALL SORTS OF TIMES,
AND GOT OUT OF THE TROUBLE BY
WRITING OUT HIS PARTNERS.
THESE
ARE THE GUYS THAT TRUMP AND
MICHAEL COHEN WERE IN BUSINESS
WITH.
TICK, TICK, TICK.
ASIDE FROM THE MANAFORT
POSSIBLE FAVOR THERE WERE OTHER
THINGS THAT CAME OUT AFTER THIS
MEETING TOOK PLACE --
HMM.
I WONDER WHAT THAT GIFT
IS.
YES.
ALSO --
AND JUST 
TO GIVE YOU A SENSE
OF SOME OF THE MONEY INVOLVED IN
ALL THIS STUFF --
LET ME JUST BE CLEAR THAT
UKRAINE HAD ABSOLUTELY NO NEED
FOR THOSE THINGS, THEY HAVE
THEIR OWN COAL, THEY HAVE THEIR
OWN RESOURCES, BUT IT TURNS OUT
THEY SPENT $1 BILLION ON
IMPORTING U.S. GOODS INSTEAD.
LET ME BE CLEAR, THAT PART I
DON'T MIND AT ALL.
IF OUR
PRESIDENT, REPUBLICAN OR
DEMOCRAT, WENT AND STRUCK A DEAL
THAT BENEFITED THE AMERICAN
PEOPLE, NOT HIMSELF BUT THE
AMERICAN PEOPLE, AND WE GOT $1
BILLION IN A DEAL THAT'S COMING
OVER TO THE U.S. IN CREATING
MORE JOBS HERE, GREAT.
THAT
ISN'T MY ISSUE.
AND LOOK, IF THE
UKRAINIANS DIDN'T NEED IT THAT'S
THEIR PROBLEM, NOT MY PROBLEM.
SO THEY SHOULD TAKE IT UP WITH
THEIR OWN PRESIDENT.
BUT IT'S ALL ABOUT THE
REASONING BEHIND WHY THEY STRUCK
THE DEAL.
OF COURSE, BUT MY POINT BEING
IS THAT IF TRUMP IS JUST MAKING
DEALS FOR COAL, WHO CARES?
IN
FACT, PROBABLY GOOD.
BUT IF HE'S
MAKING DEALS FOR COAL PLUS THAT
LITTLE GIFT WHERE YOU MAKE MY
PROBLEMS WITH COLLUSION WITH
RUSSIA GO AWAY THAT'S A BIG
DEAL, BECAUSE THAT ISN'T ABOUT
SERVING THE AMERICAN PEOPLE,
THAT IS SERVING HIMSELF AT OUR
EXPENSE, AND THAT'S THE
HEART OF THIS PROBLEM.
AND FINALLY, I -- THERE IS
SOMETHING MISSING IN THIS STORY
FOR ME, RIGHT?
BECAUSE WHAT DOES
UKRAINE GET OUT OF THIS?
THE
ARTICLES, THE REPORTING, JUST
SAYS THE DEALS CAN ONLY BE
UNDERSTOOD AS POROSHENKO BUYING
AMERICAN SUPPORT, BUT WHAT DOES
THAT MEAN?
BUYING AMERICAN
SUPPORT AND WHAT?
PROTECTING
UKRAINE FROM RUSSIA?
IS THAT
LIKELY TO HAPPEN?
I DON'T KNOW.
BUT POROSHENKO WAS APPARENTLY
ALSO BRAGGING ABOUT BEING ABLE
TO MEET WITH TRUMP AFTER THE
ELECTION BEFORE PUTIN COULD.
IT IS A LITTLE BIT OF A TWIST
HERE BECAUSE THE CURRENT
UKRAINIAN GOVERNMENT REPLACED AN
OLD UKRAINIAN GOVERNMENT WHICH
WAS PRO-RUSSIA.
SO, THAT'S WHY
THEM BEING ABLE TO MAKE THE
RUSSIAN COLLUSION GO AWAY, OR TO
MAKE IT LESS OF A CHANCE THAT IT
GETS DISCOVERED, DOESN'T QUITE
COMPUTE.
NOW, IF THEY WERE TO
SAY HEY, POROSHENKO SISTER
TRUMP, THE RUSSIANS TOOK CRIMEA
AND I KNOW YOU ARE BUDDIES WITH
THE RUSSIANS, COULD YOU TELL
THEM TO GET OFF OUR ASS AND NOT
TAKE ANYMORE OF OUR COUNTRY?
OR
SERIOUSLY AND MORE
REALISTICALLY, TO LOOSEN UP
TRADE BETWEEN OUR COUNTRIES?
BECAUSE I DON'T THINK PUTIN HAS
MADE ANY ADVANCES BEYOND CRIMEA
YET IN UKRAINE, BUT THERE'S A
LOT OF ECONOMIC AND TRADE
ISSUES, THEN THAT WOULD BE
SOMETHING UKRAINE GETS BACK.
OR
BY THE WAY, WE ARE TALKING ABOUT
BACK CHANNELS WHERE $400,000 IN
APPARENTLY ILLEGAL PAYMENTS ARE
BEING MADE, MAYBE POROSHENKO AND
HIS ALLIES WOULD LIKE SOMETHING
FOR THEMSELVES AND NOT THE
UKRAINIAN PEOPLE, THAT MIGHT
ALSO HAVE TO DO WITH OLIGARCHS,
ETC., ALL THAT IS FASCINATING,
REQUIRES MORE EVIDENCE, SO LET'S
KEEP DIGGING, RIGHT?
AGAIN THE
REPUBLICANS WILL SAY NO, YOU
SEEM TO HAVE FOUND SOMETHING
MASSIVELY ILLEGAL, THIS WOULD BE
THE TIME TO STOP DIGGING -- NO,
THIS WOULD BE THE TIME TO
CONTINUE THE INVESTIGATION
BECAUSE WE AREN'T HERE TELLING
YOU I KNOW WHAT POROSHENKO'S
MOTIVATIONS WERE.
THAT'S WHY WE
NEED TO INVESTIGATE.
DID HE GIVE
ANYONE ELSE WHAT COULD BE
CONSIDERED A BRIBE?
AND WHY?
AND
WHAT DID TRUMP GIVE IN RETURN
THAT WASN'T NECESSARILY HAS TO
GIVE?
AND WHAT DID HE RECEIVE?
THOSE ARE IMPORTANT AND IF YOU
CARED ABOUT THIS COUNTRY WOULD
CARE TO FIND OUT THE ANSWERS TO
THOSE QUESTIONS NO MATTER WHAT
THEY ARE.
THE FINAL PORTION OF THIS
STORY HAS TO DO WITH THE
RESPONSE TO THIS REPORTING, AND
APPARENTLY POROSHENKO ISN'T
PLEASED WITH THE STORY GETTING
OUT.
ACCORDING TO KENNETH VOGEL,
HE TWEETED --
YEAH, GOOD LUCK.
YOU'RE GOING
TO SUE PAPERS IN THE WEST FOR
COVERING A MEETING THAT SEEMS TO
HAVE HAPPENED?
BY THE WAY BE
CAREFUL WHAT YOU WISH FOR, THIS
WAS AN OLD TRUNK MOVE, AND YOU
KNOW WHO HE WOULD HAVE CARRIED
THIS THREAT OUT AS MICHAEL
COHEN.
HE WOULD HAVE HIM CALL UP
REPORTERS AND SAY WE ARE GOING
TO SUE YOU IF YOU REPORT THINGS
THAT ARE TRUE ABOUT TRUMP.
YOU'LL SEE.
I CAN'T WAIT FOR ALL
OF THAT TO COME OUT, A LOT OF IT
IS ALREADY PUBLIC, SO HE'S
PULLING A TRUMP GOING WE ARE,
BBC, WE ARE GOING TO SUE YOU.
REALLY?
THE PRESIDENT OF A
DIFFERENT COUNTRY IS GOING TO
SUE THE BBC?
BY THE WAY IF YOU
DID WE MIGHT FIND OUT WHAT'S
GOING ON AND THAT WOULD BE
GREAT, SO BE CAREFUL WHAT YOU
WISH FOR, THEN YOU DRAG ALL THAT
EVIDENCE INTO COURT AND WE SEE
WHAT HAPPENS.
AND HE'S NOT
REALLY GOING TO DO IT, THIS IS
ALL TO APPEAL TO TRUMP.
BECAUSE
IN HERE HE SAID THIS IS A FAKE
CAMPAIGN AIMED AT DISCREDITING
UKRAINE/U.S. RELATIONS.
THEY USE
THE WORD FAKE ON PURPOSE.
FAKE IS THROWN AROUND LEFT AND
RIGHT.
I ALMOST FEEL LIKE THAT
STATEMENT IS MR.
TRUMP, WE ARE
AGAINST THIS INFORMATION COMING
OUT, IT WASN'T US, IT'S ALL FAKE
NEWS, PLEASE, MR.
TRUMP.
SO I
CAN'T WAIT TO SEE WHAT THEY ARE
HIDING.
