OVER THE PAST SEVERAL DECADES,
TALK TO US ABOUT WHAT JOHN
MCCAIN MEANT FOR ARIZONA.
THIS
IS A REGION THAT HAS EXPLODED
OVER THE YEARS.
>> WHEN YOU ARE INVOLVED IN
TRYING TO MAKE THINGS HAPPEN,
THE EXPANSION OF THE PLAZA
DOWNTOWN, THE LIGHT RAIL SYSTEM,
THE TRANSPORTATION SYSTEM. I
NEEDED TO LEAN ON OUR LEADERSHIP
WHO REPRESENTED ARIZONA WHO
REPRESENT US WELL IN WASHINGTON
DC.
SO WE WERE GETTING OUR FAIR
SHARE OF WHAT WAS REQUIRED FOR
US TO MOVE FORWARD TO, EXPAND,
TO GROW.
TO DO ALL THOSE THINGS.
MANY, MANY CONVERSATIONS WITH
JOHN ABOUT EACH AND EVERY ONE OF
THOSE ISSUES.
AND HE WAS ALWAYS
THERE TO BE SUPPORTIVE.
>> AND WE KNOW OF SENATOR
MCCAIN AS A FIGHTER, WHAT CAN
YOU TELL US AS A CLOSE FRIEND TO
SHED SOME LIGHT ON HIS BEHAVIOR
AFTER THE DIAGNOSIS?
DID HE SAY
ANYTHING TO YOU OR EXPRESS
ANYTHING TO YOU ABOUT THIS
LATEST FIGHT IN HIS LIFE?
>> I WOULD SAY THIS.
WATCHING
HIM FROM A DISTANCE AS IT
RELATES TO POSTANNOUNCEMENT
REGARDING HIS ILLNESS, HE DID
THIS WITH SUCH CLASS, HE DID IT
WITH SUCH DIGNITY.
IT'S AMAZING.
I'M NOT SURE HOW MANY PEOPLE,
MYSELF INCLUDED, WOULD RESPOND.
BUT HE SET A GREAT EXAMPLE ABOUT
HOW TO FADE AWAY IN SUCH A
CLASSY WAY.
>> JERRY, HANG ON THE PHONE FOR
US.
BUT WE DO HAVE REACTION THAT
IS NOW POURING IN FROM SO MANY
PEOPLE ACROSS THE COUNTRY.
SO
MANY OF OUR REPRESENTATIVES.
DEMOCRATIC CANDIDATE FOR U.S.
SENATE, KIRSTEN CINEMA, JUST
TWEETED THIS.
"ARIZONA WILL
NEVER BE THE SAME.
MAY YOU REST
IN PEACE, AND MAY COMFORT COME
TO YOUR FAMILY AND TO ALL OF US
WHO WILL GRIEVE YOUR LOSS TO OUR
GREAT COUNTRY.
A STATES MAN,
PATRIOT, OUR ARIZONA HERO."
THE
CONGRESSWOMAN WHO IS RUNNING FOR
SENATOR JEFF FLAKE'S SEAT.
YOUR
REACTION TO THAT REACTION.
>> WELL, SHE COULD NOT HAVE PUT
IT ANY BETTER THAN SHE DID.
AND
I CONCUR WITH EVERYTHING SHE
SAID.
>> ALL RIGHT.
AND TO MY
PRODUCERS IN THE CONTROL ROOM,
DO WE HAVE ANY OTHER REACTION
THAT IS POURING IN AT THIS
MOMENT?
ALL RIGHT.
WE
ARE STILL WAITING TO HEAR FROM
JEFF FLAKE AND AS SOON AS WE DO,
WE WILL BRING SENATOR FLAKE ON
THE AIR.
HOPEFULLY WE'RE TRYING
TO REACH HIM BY PHONE RIGHT NOW.
AGAIN THIS BREAKING NEWS THAT
UNFOLDED AROUND 4:30 TODAY, A
WORD IN FROM THE MCCAIN CAMPAIGN
THAT THE SENATOR DID PASS AWAY
AT HIS RANCH IN CORNVILLE WHERE
HE HAS BEEN REHABILITATING FROM
HIS BATTLE WITH BRAIN SURGERY,
WHICH HE LOST TODAY AT AROUND
4:30, 4:45 PM.
WE DO BELIEVE
THAT THE BODY OF SENATOR JOHN
MCCAIN WILL BE BROUGHT DOWN FROM
THE HIGH COUNTRY, TO CENTRAL
PHOENIX TO A MORTUARY, AND WE
ARE STILL WORKING ON RECEIVING
INFORMATION ABOUT FUNERAL
ARRANGEMENTS SO THAT THE PUBLIC
CAN ALSO HAVE A CHANCE TO GRIEVE
HERE, AND PAY THEIR LAST
RESPECTS AND CONDOLENCES TO THE
MCCAIN FAMILY.
>> HE WAS DIAGNOSED WITH
GLIOBLASTOMA, AN AGGRESSIVE FORM
OF BRAIN CANCER.
AND IT'S A TYPE
OF BRAIN CANCER THAT CAN BE VERY
DIFFICULT TO TREAT AS WELL.
>> Reporter: GLIOBLASTOMA IS AN
AGGRESSIVE FORM OF BRAIN CANCER
THAT CAN BE TOUGH TO TREAT.
>> IT IS THE MOST COMMON AND
UNFORTUNATELY THE MOST MALIGNANT
PRIMARY BRAIN TUMOR.
>> Reporter: INCREASED PRESSURE
IN THE BRAIN CAN CAUSE SIMPLES
OF HEADACHE, NAUSEA, VOMITING
AND DROWSINESS.
THE AVERAGE
PATIENT SURVIVES ABOUT 15
MONTHS.
>> I ALWAYS ENCOURAGE MY
PATIENTS THAT AVERAGES ARE JUST
THAT, THEY'RE AVERAGING, AND
THERE ARE MANY PEOPLE WHO DO
BETTER THAN AVERAGE.
AND I HAVE
PATIENTS WHO LIVE FOR TWO, FIVE,
TEN YEARS.
>> Reporter: THE AMERICAN BRAIN
TUMOR ASSOCIATION SAYS MORE THAN
12,000 CASES ARE EXPECTED TO BE
DIAGNOSED THIS YEAR.
TREATMENT
TYPICALLY INVOLVES SURGERY TO
REMOVE AS MUCH OF THE TUMOR AS
POSSIBLE, CHEMOTHERAPY AND
RADIATION.
MANY PATIENTS ARE
OPTING FOR VARMENTAL TREATMENTS
-- EXPERIMENTAL TREATMENTS.
>> THERE'S A NEW DEVICE THAT
BASICALLY YOU CAN WEAR AND IT
CREATES ALTERNATING CURRENTS
THAT ARE DESIGNED TO FUSE THE
TUMOR CELLS.
>> Reporter: GLIOBLASTOMA IS
THE TYPE OF CANCER THAT KILLED
SENATOR TED KENNEDY, AND THE SON
OF JOE BIDEN.
>> THE BIDEN FAMILY, VERY CLOSE
TO THE MCCAINS.
WE WERE TALKING
ABOUT SENATOR MCCAIN BEING ABLE
TO REACH ACROSS BOTH AISLES AND
WORK WITH EVERYBODY.
AND THAT
RELATIONSHIP COULD BE NO BETTER
EXAMPLE.
>> AGAIN OLD-SCHOOL, THEY GO
BACK DECADES SERVING IN THE
SENATE TOGETHER.
MR. BIDEN HAD
VISITED MCCAIN RECENTLY UP IN
THE HIGH COUNTRY.
GOOD FRIENDS.
BIPARTISANSHIP.
OLD-SCHOOL
STUFF.
>> AS WE CONTINUE OUR MCCAIN
COVERAGE TONIGHT, SENATOR
MCCAIN, BORN INTO A MILITARY
FAMILY.
HIS LOVE FOR BRANCHES OF
ALL -- ALL BRANCHES OF THE ARMED
SERVES WELL KNOWN.
HIS LOVE OF
FLYING WAS SHARED PIE THE AIRMEN
AND AIRWOMEN OVER LUKE AIR FORCE
BASE.
IT WAS THAT SHARED PASSION
OF AVIATION AND A LITTLE BIT OF
HIS FAMOUS TEMPER THAT HELPED
SAVE THE BASE FROM THE HOUSING
BOOM OF THE NEW MILLENNIUM.
>> WITH THAT DEVELOPMENT COMING
TOWARD THE WEST VALLEY, IT'S
DIFFICULT TO SAY THEY WOULD HAVE
HAD A LONG FUTURE IN THE VALLEY.
>> Reporter: IT'S A FUTURE HE
WOULD RATHER NOT THINK ABOUT.
THE RETIRED SQUAD COMMANDER AND
COMMERCIAL PILOT SERVES AS THE
DIRECTOR OF LUKE AIR FORCE
BASE'S COMMUNITY INITIATIVES
TEAM.
HE WAS BRINGS TOGETHER
ELECTED LEADERS WITH THE BASE
COMMANDERS TO WORK ON COMMUNITY
SUPPORT.
A SOMEWHAT DIFFICULT
TASK WHEN HE FIRST TOOK OVER THE
JOB IN 2003.
SMACK IN THE MIDDLE
OF ARIZONA'S HOUSING BOOM THAT
WAS SLOWLY ENCROACHING ON THE
MILITARY BASE.
>> MARICOPA COUNTY AT THE TIME
WAS THE NO.
1 COUNTY IN THE
NATION, WITH PARK COUNTY IN LAS
VEGAS, AS THE FASTEST GROWING
COUNTY IN THE NATION.
IF
SOMETHING HADN'T BEEN ADDRESSED
THEN, WE WOULD HAVE HAD ISSUES
DOWN THE ROAD.
>> WHEN WAS THE FIRST TIME YOU
MET SENATOR MCCAIN?
>> AT THE SAME TIME I STARTED
THIS JOB.
JUNE OF 2003.
IT WAS A
MEETING HERE ON BASE, BETWEEN
THE COMMANDER AT THE TIME, JOHN
BREEDLOVE, AND THE WEST COUNTY
MAYORS, AND THE COUNTY AND THE
STATE REPRESENTATIVE CAME IN TO
SEE SENATOR MCCAIN WHO WANTED TO
TALK TO THEM THAT IT WAS TIME
FOR THE WHOLE COMMUNITY TO GET
FOCUSED ON ADDRESSING
DEVELOPMENT IN THE WEST VALLEY
AND MAKING SURE THAT LUKE AIR
FORCE BASE WOULD BE ABLE TO
CONTINUE ITS MISSION.
>> Reporter: THIS WAS BEFORE
THE RECESSION, AT A TIME WHEN
LAND DEVELOPERS WERE GOBBLING UP
HUNDREDS OF ACRES AT A TIME IN
THE WEST VALLEY TO DEVELOP
HOUSING.
WHEN IT CAME TO THE
BASE SECURITY, AND ITS
BOUNDARIES, THAT'S WHEN THE
LEGENDARY TEMPER OF SENATOR
MCCAIN ROSE TO THE SURFACE.
>> THERE SITS THE SENATOR,
WHAT'S HAPPENING AROUND HIM?
>> IT WAS ALMOST A ONE-WAY
CONVERSATION BETWEEN THE SENATOR
AND SUMMIT.
A -- SOME OF A
COUPLE OF MAYORS.
THERE WERE
DISAGREEMENTS BETWEEN THE MAYOR
AND THE SENATOR ON HOW AND WHY
LUKE AIR FORCE BASE SHOULD BE
PROTECTED.
IT WAS A RATHER
HEATED AND BOASTFUL MEETING TO
WHERE I WAS WONDERING WHAT I HAD
GOTTEN MYSELF INTO IT.
WHAT IT
DID TCLEARLY ESTABLISHED THE
FACT THAT SENATOR MCCAIN WAS
GONNA BE THERE FOR OUR BACKS,
AND AS OUR PROTECTION, GOING
FORWARD FOR ALL KIND OF WHATEVER
MISSIONS OF SUSTAINMENT LUKE AIR
FORCE BASE NEEDS.
>> Reporter: IN THAT MEETING,
MITCHELL NOTICED THE DIFFERENCES
BETWEEN THE SENATOR'S PUBLIC
PERSONA OF A SMOOTH, MAVERICK
POLITICIAN, CONTRASTED GREATLY
WITH THE BRASH AND AGGRESSIVE
FORMER NAVY FIGHTER PILOT.
>> THIS IS CLEARLY THE FORMER
NAVAL FIGHTER PILOT CAME OUT IN
HIM. HE HAD SOME EMOTION IN IT.
ALL THE MAYORS EVENTUALLY CAME
TOGETHER.
AND THE SUPPORT THAT
WE HAVE FROM ALL THE WEST VALLEY
CITIES IS INCREDIBLE.
AND IT'S
UNMATCHED ACROSS THE COUNTRY. 15
YEARS AFTER THAT MEETING, HERE
WE ARE, THE LARGEST TRAINING
BASE FOR THE F35 IN THE
MILITARY.
AND WITH A 50-YEAR
FUTURE AHEAD OF US.
>> Reporter: POINTING OUT THE
ADVANTAGE OF HAVING SOMEONE HIKE
MCCAIN IN THE SENATE FOR THE
STATE OF ARIZONA.
>> KNOWING THAT YOU HAVE THAT
IN YOUR BAG GOING INTO WHATEVER
DISCUSSIONS THAT YOU HAVE, THAT
THE CHAIRMAN OF THE SENATE ARMED
SERVICES COMMITTEE IS YOUR
SENIOR SENATOR FROM ARIZONA,
THAT'S PRICELESS.
AND IT GAVE US
A LOT OF LEVERAGE GOING IN.
>> Reporter: HIS LEGACY?
>> THAT ARIZONA AND THE
MILITARY SUPPORT -- TRAINING
SUPPORT OF THE STATE OF ARIZONA
WILL ALWAYS BE THERE BECAUSE OF
THE EFFORTS HE PUT INTO IT.
HE'S
THE ONE THAT REALLY SETS THE
STANDARD FOR MILITARY SPEED
LIMIT IN ARIZONA.
>> AS WE CONTINUE OUR COVERAGE
ON THE PASSING OF SENATOR JOHN
MCCAIN.
WE WANT TO GET TO
SENATOR JEFF FLAKE.
GOOD
AFTERNOON.
THIS IS A HEAVY DAY
FOR ALL OF US.
>> IT CERTAINLY IS.
I CAN'T
EXPRESS THE SORROW THAT I FEEL.
AND I KNOW THAT THAT'S SHARED BY
ALL ARIZONANS.
>> SENATOR, BRIEFLY IF YOU CAN,
TELL US WHAT IT WAS LIKE WORKING
ALONGSIDE SOMEBODY LIKE A
SENATOR JOHN MCCAIN IN THE U.S.
SENATE.
HIS FIGHT, HIS PASSION.
HIS BELIEF IN HIMSELF AND HIS
BELIEF IN POLICIES AND HOW HE
NEVER REALLY BUCKLED TO PRESSURE
EVER, TO ANYONE.
>> RIGHT.
>> WHAT WAS IT LIKE WORKING
WITH SENATOR MCCAIN?
>> WELL, I SIMPLY KNOW -- I AM
SIMPLY KNOWN AS THE OTHER
SENATOR FROM ARIZONA.
>> I DON'T THINK THAT TITLE
BELONGS TO ANY OTHER SENATOR
THAN JOHN MCCAIN FROM ARIZONA
FOR A LONG TIME.
JUST LARGER
THAN LIFE.
AND ALWAYS FELT LIKE
A BIG BROTHER THAT WOULD PROTECT
ME.
>> VERY MUCH.
A TOWERING FIGURE
IN THE SENATE.
AS YOU MENTIONED,
HIS WILLINGNESS TO STAND ALONE.
AND TO BE AN INDEPENDENT VOICE
WAS JUST UNMATCHED.
>> AND I JUST WANTED TO ASK,
SENATOR MCCAIN, HE USED TO SAY
IF HE LOOKED LIKE YOU, HE WOULD
HAVE BEEN PRESIDENT.
>> A GLORIOUS SENSE OF HUMOR.
HE HAD A VERY SHARP WIT.
>> HE SURE DID!
I CAMPAIGNED
WITH HIM ON HIS CAMPAIGN.
THEN
HE CAMPAIGNED ON MINE.
AND WE'D
GO OUT TO SNOWFLAKE, AND HE'D
JOKE ENDLESSLY THAT IF I DIDN'T
HAVE 69 FIRST COUSINS ON MY
FATHER'S SIDE, I WOULD NEVER
HAVE BEEN ELECTED.
>> AND HE'S PROBABLY RIGHT.
BUT
OH, AN INCREDIBLE SENSE OF
SUPER, APPRECIATED BY ALL.
A
QUICK WIT, AND JUST PASSIONATE
TOO!
I JUST WROTE AN OPED, I
THINK THE WASHINGTON POST WILL
BE RUNNING IT. I WAS JUST IN THE
HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES FOR A
FEW YEARS, OR LESS THAN A YEAR.
AND I WAS TAKING A LOT OF HEAT
AT HOME FROM EDITORIAL PAGES AND
REPORTERS AND ELECTED OFFICIALS
FOR NOT GETTING EARMARKS AND
PASSING UP ON PAROCHIAL
SPENDING.
AND I REMEMBERED ON A
FLIGHT, JOHN CAME BACK TO ME AND
STUCK HIS FINGER IN MY CHEST,
AND I THOUGHT OH, NO.
HE'S GONNA
LET ME HAVE IT!
AND HE JUST SAID
DON'T BACK DOWN.
YOU'RE DOING
THE RIGHT THING.
PEOPLE WILL
COME AROUND.
>> IT'S FASCINATING.
>> THAT WAS ALL I NEEDED.
>> THAT'S A FASCINATING -- I
WANT TO ADD TO THAT, SENATOR
FLAKE.
BECAUSE YOU ARE SOMEBODY
WHO HAS GOTTEN BEATEN UP BY MANY
PEOPLE OF YOUR OWN PARTY FOR
SPEAKING UP AGAINST SOME OF THE
BEHAVIOR OF PRESIDENT TRUMP OVER
THE PAST YEAR.
AND A LOT OF
PEOPLE HAVE ALSO BEAT UP SENATOR
MCCAIN FOR SOME OF HIS STANCES
AND HIM SPEAKING UP AND BACK
AGAINST THE PRESIDENT OF THE
UNITED STATES.
WHAT HAS THAT
BEEN LIKE?
I KNOW YOU'VE HAD
PRIVATE CONVERSATIONS WITH HIM.
BUT DO YOU THINK THAT HAS HAD AN
IMPACT ON THE SENATOR OVER THE
PAST YEAR?
KNOWING THAT SO MANY
PEOPLE IN THE REPUBLICAN PARTY
ARE MAD AT HIM, AND HAVE BEEN
MAD AT HIM FOR SPEAKING UP
AGAINST PRESIDENT TRUMP?
>> WELL, THAT NEVER STOPPED
JOHN MCCAIN FROM DOING WHAT HE
THOUGHT WAS RIGHT.
AND JOHN
MCCAIN IS THE ONE WHO WAS ALWAYS
SEEING THE GOOD IN HIS
OPPONENTS.
AND EVERYBODY IS
FAMILIAR WITH HIS CAMPAIGN WHEN
HE STOOD UP TO ONE OF HIS OWN
SUPPORTERS WHO WAS DENIGRATING
BARACK OBAMA AS A CANDIDATE.
AND
THAT'S JUST A LITTLE REMOVED
FROM THE POLITICS WE SEE TODAY,
THE SMASHMOUTH POLITICS.
SO
THAT'S WHAT MAKES -- ALWAYS MADE
JOHN MCCAIN STAND OUT, AND WHY I
THINK HE'S SO APPRECIATED AND
LOVED.
>> SENATOR TALK A LITTLE BIT
ABOUT THE SENATOR'S INTELLECTUAL
CURIOSITY.
WE'VE ALL SEEN
SENATORS, LAWMAKERS GO OFF TO
CONGRESS, AND WHEN THEY HAVE
BEEN THERE AS LONG AS JOHN HAD
BEEN, THEY START MAILING IT IN.
BUT IT ALWAYS SEEMED LIKE
SENATOR MCCAIN WAS ON TOP OF
EVERYTHING.
>> HE WAS.
AND I WAS UP THERE
YESTERDAY WITH HE AND HIS
FAMILY.
AND I EXPRESSED TO HIS
FAMILY HOW MUCH I APPRECIATED --
AND ALL OF US APPRECIATED HIS
VOICE DURING THIS PAST YEAR.
IT
WAS VERY DIFFICULT FOR HIM.
BUT
HE MAINTAINED THE CONTACT.
HE
WAS WITH HIS STAFF.
HE DID TAKE
HIS TWEETS.
HE SPOKE WHEN WE
NEEDED SOMEBODY TO SPEAK.
AND HE
WAS INTELLECTUALLY CURIOUS TO
THE END.
I WAS ALWAYS FASCINATED
FASCINATED.
TRAVELLING ON THE STRAIGHT TALK
EXPRESS.
>> SENATOR DID WE LOSE YOU?
>> NO.
>> WE GOT HIM, GOT HIM BACK.
CONTINUE.
>> I WAS JUST SAYING TO HEAR
HIM HOLD COURT WITH REPORTERS,
AND TO TALK EVERYTHING FROM
OBSCURE SPORTS TRIVIA TO THE
LATEST NOVEL HE'D READ, OR
HIGH-BROW LITERATURE, IT WAS
PHENOMENAL.
I DON'T KNOW WHEN HE
EVER SLEPT.
>> BUT I WAS ALWAYS AMAZED AT
THE MAN.
>> SENATOR, THANK OU SO MUCH.
>> THANKS FOR HAVING ME.
>> FOR SPENDING SOME OF YOUR
EVENING FROM WHAT IS NO DOUBT A
TOUGH DAY, NOT ONLY FOR YOU,
LOSING ONE OF YOUR DEAREST
FRIENDS AND COLLEAGUES.
WE
APPRECIATE YOU CALLING IN TODAY
AND SHARING SOME OF THAT
SENTIMENT WITH US.
AND I KNOW
YOU'LL HAVE YOUR PHONE ON
STANDBY.
WE WILL BE CALLING YOU
LATER TONIGHT.
BUT WE ARE
GETTING SOME REACTION FROM MEGAN
MCCAIN.
YOU MAY WANT TO LISTEN
TO THE STATEMENT THAT WE'RE
ABOUT TO READ.
AGAIN THE
DAUGHTER OF JOHN MCCAIN, JUST
NOW TWEETING OUT A FULL
STATEMENT TONIGHT.
>> "I LOVE YOU FOREVER MY
BELOVED FATHER.
AND SHE INCLUDED
THIS LETTER TO HER DAD.
SHE SAID
I WAS WITH MY FATHER AT THE END.
HE WAS WITH ME AT THE BEGINNING,
THE 33 YEARS WE SHARED TOGETHER,
HE RAISED ME, TAUGHT ME,
CORRECTED ME, COMFORTED ME,
ENCOURAGED ME, AND SUPPORTED ME
IN ALL THINGS.
HE LOVED ME AND I
LOVED HIP.
HE TAUGHT ME HOW TO
LIVE.
HIS LOVE AND HIS CARE
EVER-PRESENT, ALWAYS UNFAILING
TOOK ME FROM A GIRL TO A WOMAN.
AND HE SHOWED ME WHAT IT IS TO
BE A MAN.
SHE ENDED THIS NOTE
WITH A QUOTE "THE DREAM IS
ENDING.
THIS IS THE MORNING".
AND THAT IS A QUOTE FROM CS.
LEWIS.
HIS WORK CALLED THE LAST
BATTLE.
>> IT IS A POWERFUL, POWERFUL
MESSAGE.
THE BOND THAT WE HAVE
SEEN BETWEEN FATHER AND
DAUGHTER.
AND I HAVE MET MEGAN
MCCAIN ON MULTIPLE TIMES, RAN
INTO HER ON STREETS IN NEW YORK
CITY TWO YEARS AGO.
SHE IS A
SPITFIRE HERSELF.
SHE IS JUST
LIKE HER FATHER.
I SWEAR SHE
CHANNELS SOME OF HER FATHER'S
FIGHT IN HER.
>> VERY TRUE.
>> YOU'LL SEE THE JOHN MCCAIN
IN HIS DAUGHTER.
>> FAMILY WAS VERY IMPORTANT TO
HIM.
AND HE OBVIOUSLY SHOWED
THAT CARING FOR HIS FAMILY
THROUGHOUT HIS ENTIRE CAREER.
AND JUST ALWAYS EXPRESSING --
YOU ALWAYS SAW HER AROUND,
ESPECIALLY DURING THE 2008
CAMPAIGN.
ALWAYS BY HIS SIDE IN
THOSE BIG MOMENTS.
>> A LOT OF REACTION POURING IN
FROM THE PRESIDENT.
THE PHOENIX
MAYOR.
CINDY MCCAIN.
>> WE LITERALLY HAVE A BUNCH OF
TABS OPEN HERE WITH SO MANY
PEOPLE WHO WERE CLOSE TO JOHN
MCCAIN.
ALL OF THEM HAVE STUFF
TO SAY.
AND WE WANT TO START
WITH CINDY MCCAIN.
THE SENATOR'S
WIFE.
SHE HAS A NEW TWEET THAT
SAYS "MY HEART IS BROKEN.
I'M SO
LUCKY TO HAVE LIVED THE
ADVENTURE OF LOVING THIS
INCREDIBLE MAN FOR 38 YEARS.
HE
PASSED THE WAY HE LIVED, ON HIS
OWN TERMS, SURROUNDED BY THE
PEOPLE HE LOVED IN THE PLACE HE
LOVED BEST.
WE " AND ADDITION TO
WHAT LINDY READ FROM HIS
DAUGHTER, THE PRESIDENT TRUMP
ALSO TWEETED "MY DEEPEST
SYMPATHIES AND RESPECTS GO OUT
TO THE FAMILY OF SENATOR JOHN
MCCAIN.
OUR HEARTS AND PRAYERS
ARE WITH YOU."
THESE TWEETS
COMING IN RIGHT NOW.
A LOT OF
THEM AS PEOPLE ARE PROCESSING
THIS NEWS, WE'RE SEEING THE
TWEETS APPEAR FROM OTHER FIGURES
WHO HAVE BEEN CLOSE TO JOHN
MCCAIN IN VARIOUS ASPECTS.
ONE
FROM LINDSEY GRAHAM, A SENATOR
HIMSELF, AND HIS FIRST REACTION
ON TWITTER WAS "AMERICA LOST ONE
OF ITS GREATEST CHAMPIONS, AND
I'VE LOST ONE OF MY DEAREF
FRIENDS AND MENTORS."
>> THE TWO OF THEM WERE ALLIES.
>> YEAH.
AND WHAT KIND OF
THINGS DID THEY HAVE
SHOWCASES THE BOND THEY HAD?
>> WHEN YOU FIRST THINK ABOUT
LINDSEY GRAHAM, THEY SAT SIDE BY
SIDE.
WHEN GRAHAM RAN FOR
PRESIDENT, YES, A LOT OF PEOPLE
FORGET THAT, BUT JOHN MCCAIN WAS
HIS LOYAL FRIEND AND ENDORSED
HIM.
A VERY EMOTIONAL MOMENT.
IT'S HARD NOT TO GET CHOKED UP.
BUT LINDSEY GRAHAM LOVES JOHN
MCCAIN LIKE A BROTHER.
THEY ARE
SO TIGHT.
AND IT'S JUST AMAZING.
>> HE WAS A MENTOR TOO.
WHEN
LINDSEY GRAHAM WAS ELECTED TO
THE U.S. SENATE, I BELIEVE IT
WAS THE YEAR 2002, HE ATTACHED
HIMSELF TO SENATOR MCCAIN.
AND
MCCAIN BROUGHT GRAHAM OVERSEAS
AS OUR COUNTRY WAS BATTLING
WARS.
AND SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM
WANTED TO ABSORB AS MUCH OF THE
POLICY AND INFLUENCE AS HE COULD
FROM MCCAIN.
THEY TRULY BONDED
IN THEIR FRIENDSHIP.
THE WAR AND
TRAVELLING OVERSEAS TOGETHER.
>> AND I'M THINKING ABOUT THE
GANG OF EIGHT BILL, THE
BIPARTISAN IMMIGRATION BILL,
DIDN'T WIN A LOT OF FRIENDS ON
THE REPUBLICAN SIDE, VERY
CONTROVERSIAL BILL.
THEY WENT
THROUGH IT, YOU KNOW?
AND THAT
SHOWS THE KIND OF FIERCE LOYALTY
AND THE TOUGHNESS OF JOHN MCCAIN
AND THE LOYALTY AND THE BOND
BETWEEN LINDSEY GRAHAM AND MR.
MCCAIN.
>> MORE REACTION IS POURING IN
TONIGHT.
>> HE ADDED HE WAS HONORED TO
KNOW HIM AND WILL CONTINUE TO
WORK ON ISSUES THAT WERE WELL
KNOWN TO HIM.
>>> GODSPEED, SENATOR McCAIN. 
MY PRAYERS FOR CINDY AND THE 
BEAUTIFUL McCAIN FAMILY. 
>> I DON'T THINK WE HAVE A FULL 
SCREEN MADE OF THIS BUT YOU CAN 
COME BACK TO THE STUDIO BECAUSE 
THIS IS AN IMPORTANT STATEMENT 
FROM HIS GOOD FRIEND ON THE 
OTHER SIDE OF THE AISLE. 
JOE BIDEN. 
VICE PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN. H 
-- A POND OF GUYS WHO WERE TWO 
TRUE BEST FRIENDS. 
>> I WANT TO READ THIS YEAR. 
JOHN McCAIN WAS MANY THINGS, A 
PROUD GRADUATE OF THE NAVAL 
ACADEMY, A SENATE COLLEAGUE, A 
POLITICAL OPPONENT BUT MORE 
THAN ANYTHING, HE WILL BE 
MISSED DEARLY. 
>> ONE OF THE BONDS THAT THEY 
SHARED TOGETHER, JOE BIDEN'S 
SON, BEAU, DIED OF THE EXACT 
SAME BRAIN TUMOR.  
THAT WAS THE CONNECTION. 
BECAUSE MEGHAN McCAIN HAS SAID 
ON MULTIPLE COUNTS  THAT JOE 
BIDEN HAS TURNED INTO A 
SECONDARY FATHER AND HAS TRULY 
HELPED MEGHAN McCAIN AND THE 
McCAIN FAMILY GET THROUGH THIS 
TIME.  
MEGHAN SAID SHE WOULD CALL ON 
JOE BIDEN ALL THE TIME SAYING, 
HOW DID YOU GET THROUGH THIS? 
GIVE ME SOME HELP. 
GIVE ME SOME PERSPECTIVE.  
>> A TRULY EMOTIONA MOMENT, 
WHEN JOE BIDEN APPEARED ON HER 
MORNING TALKSHOW. 
>> YEAH, "THE VIEW." 
>> A VERY POWERFUL MOMENT. 
>> FAMILY AND FRIENDSHIP ABOVE 
POLITICS IS A LIFE LESSON THAT 
SO MANY OF US SAW, THE 
RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN A 
DEMOCRATIC VICE PRESIDENT AND 
SOMEBODY AS POWERFUL AS JOHN 
McCAIN ON THE REPUBLICAN SIDE, 
TWO MEN WHO FUNDAMENTALLY 
DISAGREE ON FUNDAMENTAL ISSUES 
GOING ON IN THIS COUNTRY. 
THEY SAW THROUGH ALL OF THAT. 
>> HE PREACHED BIPARTISANSHIP. 
HE WANTED AND PREACHED THAT HIS 
ENTIRE CAREER, TO WORK 
TOGETHER. 
HE PRIDED HIMSELF ON BEING ABLE 
TO WORK ON BIG ISSUES WITH THE 
OTHER SIDE OF THE AISLE. 
IT'S UNFORTUNATE THAT HE PASSES 
WHEN HE HAD SO MANY CONCERNS 
ABOUT WHERE THE STATE OF 
POLITICS ARE IN THIS COUNTRY 
RIGHT NOW. 
>>> THIS IS A CBS NEWS SPECIAL 
REPORT. 
I'M REENA NINAN.  
JOHN McCAIN, SENATOR, 
PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE, AND 
VIETNAM WAR HERO HAS DIED. 
AFTER A 13 MONTH BATTLE WITH 
BRAIN CANCER. 
THE REPUBLICAN FROM ARIZONA WAS 
81. 
HIS FAMILY ANNOUNCED YESTERDAY 
HE WAS DISCONTINUING MEDICAL 
TREATMENT. 
CBS NEWS' CHIEF CONGRESSIONAL 
CORRESPONDENT NANCY CORDES 
LOOKS BACK AT THE LIFE OF JOHN 
McCAIN.  
>> I'VE BEEN AN IMPERFECT 
SERVANT OF MY COUNTRY FOR MANY 
YEARS. 
BUT, I HAVE BEEN A SERVANT 
FIRST, LAST, AND ALWAYS. 
>> Reporter: JOHN SIDNEY McCAIN 
III WAS A MILITARY HERO WHO 
BECAME A MAVERICK POLITICIAN. 
HE JOINED THE FAMILY BUSINESS, 
BECOMING A NAVY PILOT. 
IN 1967 ON A FARMING RUN, HE 
WAS SHOT DOWN AND BADLY 
INJURED. 
THEN, BAYONETED AFTER SPLASHING 
DOWN IN A LAKE. 
>> WHEN THEY FOUND OUT MY 
FATHER WAS AN ADMIRAL, THEY 
TOOK ME TO THE HOSPITAL. 
>> Reporter: WHILE HOLDING HIM 
AS A PRISONER OF WAR, THE NORTH 
VIETNAMESE TRIED TO EXPLOIT HIS 
FAMILY CONNECTIONS. 
THEY OFFERED HIM AN EARLY 
RELEASE BUT HE REFUSED TO 
VIOLATE THE MILITARY CODE OF 
THE FIRST IN, FIRST OUT. 
HE WAS FINALLY FREED AFTER FIVE 
AND HALF YEARS OF TORTURE. 
>> I KNOW THAT I'M A BETTER 
PERSON FOR IT. 
>> Reporter: IN 1982, HE WAS 
ELECTED FROM ARIZONA TO THE 
U.S. HOUSE AND 4 YEARS LATER TO 
THE SENATE. 
HE EARNED A REPUTATION FOR 
STRAIGHT TALK. 
>> IF THE SPECIAL INTERESTS 
CONTINUE TO PLAY A GREATER AND 
GREATER ROLE IN THE FORMULATION 
OF LEGISLATION, THEN WE WILL 
SEE A BREAKDOWN OF DEMOCRACY AS 
WE KNOW IT. 
AND I'M NOT EXAGGERATING. 
>> Reporter: IN 2008, HE 
CLINCHED THE REPUBLICAN 
NOMINATION, CHOOSING ANOTHER 
MAVERICK AS A RUNNING MATE. 
>> GOVERNOR SARAH PALIN OF THE 
GREAT STATE OF ALASKA. 
>> Reporter: HE ENERGIZE 
CONSERVATIVES. 
BUT IN THE MIDST OF A FINANCIAL 
CRISIS, THE COUNTRY WAS READY 
FOR A CHANGE. 
DEMOCRAT BARACK OBAMA BEAT 
McCAIN WITH A 2-1 ELECTORAL 
LANDSLIDE. 
HE RETURNED TO THE SENATE, 
BECAME CHAIR OF THE ARMED 
SERVICES COMMITTEE, DREW FIRE 
FROM DONALD TRUMP.  
>> HE'S A WAR HERO BECAUSE HE 
WAS CAPTURED. 
I LIKE PEOPLE THAT WEREN'T 
CAPTURED, OKAY? 
I HATE TO TELL YOU. 
>> Reporter: AND RETURNED IT. 
>> THIS ADMINISTRATION IS IN 
DISARRAY. 
>> Reporter: IN THE SUMMER OF 
2017, THE NORMALLY SHARP McCAIN 
GREW FATIGUED AND HAD A FEW 
VERBAL STUMBLES. 
>> IN THE CASE OF MR. COMEY, 
PRESIDENT COMEY --  
>> NO, SIR. 
>> EXCUSE ME, PRESIDENT TRUMP. 
>> Reporter: TESTS REVEALED 
GLIOBLASTOMA. 
AN AGGRESSIVE FORM OF BRAIN 
CANCER. 
STILL, THE FORMER FIGHTER PILOT 
RETURNED TO THE SENATE TO CAST 
A DECISIVE VOTE AGAINST A 
SLAPDASH EFFORT TO REVEAL PARTS 
OF OBAMA CARE. 
AND AFTER 3 1/2 DECADES IN 
CONGRESS, HE LEFT HIS COLLEAGUES
WITH AN ENTREATY TO WORK 
TOGETHER. 
>> WE ARE GETTING NOTHING DONE, 
MY FRIENDS. 
WE ARE GETTING NOTHING DONE. 
AND THE TIMES WHEN I WAS 
INVOLVED EVEN IN A MODEST WAY 
WITH WORKING FOR A BIPARTISAN 
RESPONSE PROBLEM TO A NATIONAL 
THREAT ARE THE PROUDEST MOMENTS 
IN MY CAREER, AND BY FAR THE 
MOST SATISFYING. 
>> Reporter: A MESSAGE ONLY A 
MAVERICK COULD DELIVER. 
NANCY CORDES, CBS NEWS, 
WASHINGTON.  
>> TO REPEAT, SENATOR JOHN 
McCAIN OF ARIZONA HAS DIED 
AFTER A 13 MONTH BATTLE WITH 
BRAIN CANCER. 
HE WAS 81. 
THERE WILL BE MORE ABOUT 
SENATOR McCAIN ON YOUR LOCAL 
NEWS ON THIS CBS STATION AND 
OUR 24-HOUR STREAMING NEWS 
SERVICE, CBSN. 
THIS HAS BEEN A CBS NEWS 
SPECIAL REPORT.  
I'M REENA NINAN,, CBS NEWS, NEW 
YORK.  
>> FOR NEWS 24 HOURS A DAY, GO 
TO  CBSNEWS.COM. 
>> AT THIS MOMENT,  IT REALLY 
STUCK WITH ME FOLLOWING THE 
LIFE AND THE CAREER OF SOMEBODY 
WHO HAS FOLLOWED JOHN McCAIN 
FOR SO MANY YEARS. 
AND I'D LOVE FOR YOU TO COMMENT 
ON THAT AND SHARE SOMETHING OF 
YOURS. 
I WILL GIVE YOU A MOMENT TO 
THINK ABOUT THAT, BUT I'LL 
NEVER FORGET THE MOMENT WHEN 
SENATOR McCAIN RAN FOR 
PRESIDENT AGAINST BARACK OBAMA. 
HE WAS AT A CAMPAIGN RALLY, OR 
MORE OF A TOWN HALL MEETING. 
HE WAS TAKING QUESTIONS FROM 
THE AUDIENCE AND A WOMAN TOOK A 
MICROPHONE. 
SHE WAS CALLING SENATOR OBAMA A 
MUSLIM. 
SHE DID NOT TRUST HIM BECAUSE 
HE WAS A MUSLIM. 
AND HE IMMEDIATELY STOPPED HER 
AND SAID, NO, MA'AM, NO, MA'AM. 
AGAIN, EXCUSE ME, WE ARE 
SHOWING YOU THESE LIVE PICTURES 
RIGHT NOW. 
THIS IS WHAT WE BELIEVE TO BE 
THE MOTORCADE. 
FROM MY PRODUCERS WHO ARE 
FEEDING ME THIS POSITION, IS 
THIS MOTOR COUNTRY FROM HIS 
RANCH? IT IS. 
THESE ARE PICTURES COMING FROM 
THE McCAIN RANCH. 
SENATOR KYLE, I DON'T KNOW IF 
YOU ARE WATCHING 3TV AT YOUR 
HOME RIGHT NOW BUT THERE IS A 
LARGE MOTORCADE  THAT APPEARS 
TO EITHER BE LEAVING OR 
ENTERING THE COMPOUND, THE 
McCAIN COMPOUND UP IN 
CORNVILLE.  
THAT IS WHERE THE SENATOR 
PASSED AWAY EARLIER THIS 
AFTERNOON. 
LET'S KEEP THESE LIVE PICTURES 
GOING. 
SENATOR, BACK TO THE STORY 
ABOUT HOWHE CUT OFF THAT WOMAN 
AT THE TOWN HALL AND GOES, NO, 
MA'AM, HE IS NOT A MUSLIM. 
HE IS OF GOOD CHRISTIAN FAITH. 
HE IS A FAMILY MAN. 
WE JUST HAPPEN TO HAVE 
FUNDAMENTAL DIFFERENCES ON THE 
ISSUES OF THIS COUNTRY BUT I'LL 
NEVER FORGET WHEN SENATOR 
McCAIN SAYS OBAMA IS A DECENT 
MAN AND THAT ALWAYS STOOD OUT 
TO ME. 
BECAUSE AS SENATOR JEFF FLAKE 
SAID, HE ALWAYS SAW THE BEST IN 
HIS POLITICAL OPPONENTS. 
WHAT CAN YOU ADD ON THAT? 
>> THAT'S EXACTLY CORRECT. 
AND I HEARD WHAT SENATOR FLAKE 
SAID. 
HE IS EXACTLY RIGHT. 
AND I KNOW THAT'S A FAMOUS BIT 
OF FILM AND A GOOD THING TO 
KEEP IN YOUR FILE BECAUSE IT 
DOES ILLUSTRATE THE WAY THAT 
JOHN APPROACHED HIS CAMPAIGNS 
AND THE WAY THAT HE APPROACHED 
LIFE. 
HE WAS A PERSON, HE WAS NOT 
GOING TO LET ANYBODY TRY TO 
SCORE INAPPROPRIATE POINTS ON 
THINGS THAT HE JUST THAT WERE 
NOT PROPER DISCOURSE. 
AND THAT'S A GOOD EXAMPLE OF 
EXACTLY WHAT HE FELT. 
I CAN REMEMBER HIM COMING ON 
THE SENATE FLOOR, AND SAYING, 
LOOK, I DON'T CARE ABOUT THE 
SITUATION HERE, THESE DEMOCRATS 
DESERVE A VOTE ON WHATEVER IT 
WAS THEY WERE TRYING TO GET A 
VOTE ON. 
I CAN REMEMBER HIM DOING THAT. 
SO, HE WAS EQUAL OPPORTUNITY IN 
HIS CRITICISM, AND HIS SUPPORT. 
>> AS SOMEBODY WHO HAS KNOWN 
HIM PROFESSIONALLY AND HE 
WORKED ALONGSIDE HIM I BELIEVE 
YOU SAID FOR 18 YEARS, SENATOR 
KYL,  YOU SEE THE CURRENT STATE 
OF POLITICS THAT WE ARE LIVING 
IN RIGHT NOW. 
ONE OF THE BIGGEST BOATS THAT 
WILL GO DOWN IN HISTORY WHEN WE 
ALL REFLECT BACK ON SENATOR 
McCAIN WITH THE OBAMA CARE VOTE 
WHERE HE GAVE THE THUMBS DOWN 
ON THE SENATE FLOOR. 
AND HE DID. 
YOU KNOW, SENATOR McCAIN  WOULD 
OFTEN TIMES GET BEAT UP BY 
MEMBERS OF HIS OWN PARTY, BY 
REPUBLICANS IN GENERAL. 
AND ESPECIALLY, IT HAS GOTTEN 
THAT WAY OVER THE PAST YEAR OR 
TWO. 
I'M JUST WONDERING AS YOU ARE 
SITTING THERE ON THE SIDELINES 
NOW AS A FORMER SENATOR FROM 
ARIZONA, AND I KNOW THAT YOU 
ARE OBSERVING ALL OF THIS 
STUFF, HAT HAS BEEN SOME OF 
THE FEELINGS YOU'VE SEEN OVER 
THE PRESS COVERAGE OR SOME OF 
THE STATEMENS BEING MADE BY 
MEMBERS OF THE REPUBLICAN 
PARTY? 
AGAINST SENATOR JOHN McCAIN. 
AND JUST YOUR REFLECTION ON 
THAT. 
>> WELL, JOHN DIDN'T ALWAYS 
ADHERE TO THE PARTY LINE, AND 
DID NOT ALWAYS VOTE WITH ALL OF 
HIS COLLEAGUES. 
HE AND I HAD SOME 
DISAGREEMENTS. 
ONE OF THE VERY FIRST THINGS I 
REMEMBER IN THE SENATE IS, I 
HAD ONLY BEEN THERE THREE OR 
FOUR DAYS. 
I WENT DOWN TO BOAT AND 
REALIZED HE HAD ALREADY VOTED. 
AND BEFORE I VOTED, I WAS GOING 
TO VOTE YES AND I SEE YOU VOTED 
NO. 
AND HE JUST -- 
>> YEAH, YEAH. 
>> WE ARE GOING TO HAVE A LOT 
OF DISAGREEMENTS. 
DON'T WORRY ABOUT THE WAY I 
VOTED, YOU BOUGHT THE WAY YOU 
VOTED. 
SOMETIMES WE VOTED DIFFERENTLY 
AND I WOULD HAVE VOTED 
DIFFERENTLY ON THAT PARTICULAR 
BOAT. 
IT DID NOT MATTER. 
HE DID WHAT HE THOUGHT IS RIGHT 
AND, HE AND I, WHILE WE MAY 
HAVE HAD OUR PRIVATE 
DISAGREEMENTS, WE DID NOT LET 
THAT INTERFERE WITH OUR ABILITY 
TO REPRESENT THE PEOPLE OF 
ARIZONA. 
WITH ALL DUE RESPECT, I THINK 
WE DID A VERY GOOD JOB AS A 
TEAM. 
>> I WAS GOING TO SAY, CAN YOU 
TALK TO US ABOUT THE MAVERICK 
LEGACY? 
DO YOU THINK THERE IS A FAIR 
LEGACY FOR THIS MAN? 
OBVIOUSLY HE DID PICK HIS 
MOMENTS WHERE HE BUCKED THE 
PARTY BUT HE WAS A REPUBLICAN 
MAN THROUGH AND THROUGH. 
>> HE WAS BOTH. 
ELECT THE PHRASE MAVERICK AND 
AT ONE POINT SAID, NO, NO, I'M 
NOT REALLY A MAVERICK. 
BUT HE WAS AND I THINK YOU 
WOULD AGREE TO THAT. 
HE DID WHAT HE THOUGHT WAS BEST 
AND, YOU KNOW, DAMN THE 
CONSEQUENCES. 
WELL, YOU KNOW, HE DID NOT TELL 
THE PEOPLE OF ARIZONA ANY 
DIFFERENT. 
HE SAID, THIS IS WHO I AM AND 
IF YOU WANT TO SUPPORT ME, I 
WILL DO WHAT I THINK IS RIGHT 
AND I WILL COME BACK AND 
EXPLAIN TO YOU WHY. 
>> SENATOR KYL, THANK YOU SO 
MUCH FOR SPENDING SOME MOMENTS 
ON THIS AFTERNOON ON A DAY THAT 
SO MANY PEOPLE ARE GRIEVING AND 
I KNOW THAT YOU AND YOUR FAMILY 
ARE GRIEVING THE LOSS OF 
SENATOR McCAIN.  
THANK YOU FOR CALLING US TODAY 
AND SHARING SOME OF THOSE 
PERSONAL STORIES REFLECTING 
BACK ON SENATOR McCAIN.  
FORMER SENATOR JON KYL WHO 
SERVED GREATLY FOR THE STATE OF 
ARIZONA, WAS A COLLEAGUE OF 
SENATOR JOHN McCAIN FOR 18 
YEARS. 
SENATOR KYL,  THANK YOU VERY 
MUCH AND KEEP YOUR PHONE HANDY. 
WE WILL BE CALLING YOU BACK 
OVER THE NEXT COURSE OF THE DAY 
OR TWO. 
I WANT TO BRING IN MY GOOD 
FRIEND FROM "GOOD MORNING 
ARIZONA" JAVIER SOTO, WHO 
RECALLED -- WE CALLED LAST 
MINUTE AS THE NEWS BROKE. 
YOU'VE BEEN HERE IN THE STATE 
OF ARIZONA, AND I KNOW YOU'VE 
HAD YOUR EXPERIENCES OF DEALING 
WITH SENATOR JOHN McCAIN, 
REFLECT BACK ON THE MOMENT THAT 
YOU HEARD THE NEWS FROM 
YESTERDAY WHEN HE WAS GOING TO 
STOP TREATMENT AND JUST YOUR 
REACTION. 
>> I THINK IMMEDIATELY WHEN YOU 
HEAR THAT THEY WERE GOING TO 
SUSPEND TREATMENT, YOU START 
DRAWING ON SOME OF THOSE 
MEMORIES. 
AND I THINK ONE OF THE MORE 
VIVID MEMORIES THAT STICKS OUT 
TO ME, AND DENNIS, I DON'T KNOW 
IF YOU WERE AT 3TV YET OR IF 
YOU WERE THERE COVERING IT AS A 
NEWSPAPER REPORTER,  BUT, THE 
2008 CAMPAIGN. 
WHEN HE GAVE HIS ACCEPTANCE 
SPECH. 
YOU SAW HIM TOWARD THE END OF 
THAT RUN. 
HE WAS BEAT UP. 
HE KNEW THAT HE WAS AN UNDERDOG 
IN THAT, BUT HE CONTINUED THAT 
WITH SO MUCH GRACE. 
AND, THAT LAST CONCESSION 
SPEECH THAT HE GAVE WITH SO 
MUCH GRACE RIGHT IN FRONT OF 
HIS HOME CROWD THERE AT THE 
BILTMORE. 
>> AND YOU JUST KNEW WHAT KIND 
OF MAN HE WAS. 
HE WANTED TO WIN. 
AND HE OFTEN JOKED ABOUT THAT. 
HE SAID, HOW DID YOU GET 
THROUGH THE LOSS? 
AND HE WOULD TALK ABOUT HOW, I 
CRIED LIKE A BABY. 
I WOULD SLEEP FOR A LITTLE BIT, 
I WOULD WAKE UP, I'D CRY. 
THAT BECAME S SIGNATURE JOKE. 
BUT WITH SO MUCH GRACE, AND 
THEN JUMPED RIGHT BACK INTO IT 
AND SAID, LET'S GET BACK TO 
WORK. 
DURING THE CONCESSION SPEECH, 
YOU WILL RECALL HE TRIED TO 
GATHER THE AMERICANS TO SUPPORT 
PRESIDENT OBAMA, SAYING THIS IS 
ONE AMERICA. 
WE NEED TO MOVE FORWARD. 
>> WE WANT TO TAKE YOU TO 
DOWNTOWN PHOENIX. 
WE WERE MENTIONING EARLIER THAT 
GOVERNOR DUCEY SENT OUT A TWEET 
SAYING ALL FLIGHTS WILL BE 
LOWERED AT HALF  STAFF. 
WE HAVE A CREW IN DOWNTOWN 
PHOENIX, MY PRODUCER TELLING US 
THAT ONE OF OUR REPORTERS, 
BREANNA WHITNEY, IS THERE. 
I BELIEVE THAT THEY ARE IN THE 
PROCESS OF LOWERING THE FLAG 
DOWN AT THE CAPITOL TO HAVE 
STAFF. 
TALK US THROUGH IT. 
>> THEY ARE. 
HE JUST GOT TO THE CAPITAL 
HERE. 
IS GOING TO GO LOWER, ACTUALLY, 
WE WERE TALKING TO HIM. 
HE SAID HE FOUND OUT FROM HIS 
GRAND DAUGHTER TODAY THAT JOHN 
McCAIN HAD PASSED AWAY AND IT 
WAS HIS JOB TODAY TO COME OUT 
HERE AND LOWER THESE FLAGS TO 
HALF STAFF HERE AT THE CAPITAL 
AND THE CAPITOL COMPLEX IN THE 
DOWNTOWN AREA. 
HE SAYS HE'S BEEN WORKING FOR 
THE STATE FOR 30 YEARS. 
SO, YOU CAN IMAGINE HOW MUCH HE 
FELT WHEN HE HEARD THAT JOHN 
McCAIN HAD PASSED AWAY EARLIER 
TODAY. 
HE'S GOING TO BE DOING THIS 
AROUND HERE IN THE AREA. 
NOT A LOT OF ACTIVITY AROUND 
THE CAPITAL RIGHT NOW BUT WE 
ARE SEEING MORE PEOPLE STOPPING 
BY AS THEY HEAR ABOUT WHAT'S 
GOING ON. 
SO, RAY JUST FINISHED UP. 
HE SAID IT'S ALWAYS THE 
NATIONAL FLAG THAT GOES DOWN 
HALF STAFF LAST, IT'S ALSO THE 
FLAG THAT GOES UP FIRST IN THE 
MORNING. 
NONE OF THESE FLAGS CAN BE 
HIGHER THAN OUR NATION'S FLAG. 
HE'S FINISHING UP RIGHT NOW. 
YOU CAN SEE THE ANGLE WE'VE GOT 
HERE. 
JUST A BEAUTIFUL SIGHT AT THE 
CAPITAL. 
WE'VE GOT THE CLOUDS IN THE 
BACKGROUND, WE NOW SEE THESE 
FLAGS AT HALF STAFF, OBVIOUSLY 
HONORING AN AMERICAN HERO THAT 
MANY RESPECTED ARIZONA. 
GUYS, BACK TO YOU. 
>> THAT IS BREANNA WHITNEY. 
LIVE PICTURES INTO OUR NEWSROOM 
TONIGHT, GOVERNOR DUCEY HAS 
ORDERED ALL FLAGS ACROSS THE 
STATE BE LOWERED AT HALF STAFF. 
WE DO HAVE A COMMENT COMING IN, 
SOME REACTION FROM FORMER 
PRESIDENT OBAMA. 
>> HE JUST TWEETED OUT AND I 
QUOTE, JOHN McCAIN AND I WERE 
MEMBERS OF DIFFERENT 
GENERATIONS. 
CAME FROM COMPLETELY DIFFERENT 
BACKGROUNDS AND COMPETED AT THE 
HIGHEST LEVEL OF POLITICS. 
BUT WE SHARED, FOR ALL OF OUR 
DIFFERENCES, A FIDELITY OF 
SOMETHING HIGHER. 
THE IDEALS FOR WHICH 
GENERATIONS OF AMERICANS AND 
IMMIGRANTS ALIKE HAVE FOUGHT, 
MARCHED, AND SACRIFICED. 
WE SAW OUR POLITICAL BATTLES, 
EVEN AS A PRIVILEGE, SOMETHING 
NOBLE, AN OPPORTUNITY TO SERVE 
AS STEWARDS OF THOSE HIGH 
IDEALS AT HOME, AND TO ADVANCE 
THEM AROUND THE WORLD. 
WE SAW THIS COUNTRY AS A PLACE 
WHERE ANYTHING IS POSSIBLE, AND 
CITIZENSHIP AS OUR PATRIOTIC 
OBLIGATION TO ENSURE IT FOREVER 
REMAINS THAT WAY. 
FEW OF US HAVE BEEN TESTED THE 
WAY JOHN ONCE WAS ARE REQUIRED 
TO SHOW THE KIND OF COURAGE 
THAT HE DID. 
BUT ALL OF US CAN ASPIRE TO THE 
COURAGE TO PUT THE GREATER GOOD 
ABOUT OUR OWN. 
AT JOHN'S BEST, HE SHOWED US 
WHAT THAT MEANS, AND FOR THAT, 
WE ARE ALL IN HIS DEBT. 
MICHELLE AND I SEND OUR MOST 
HEARTFELT CONDOLENCES TO CINDY 
AND THEIR FAMILY. 
>> TWO GUYS WHO BATTLED IT OUT 
IN 2007-2008. 
>> SUCH ELEGANT WORDS FROM A 
FORMER POLITICAL OPPONENT. 
THOSE TWO WENT AT IT TOOTH AND 
NAIL BUT OBVIOUSLY, A WHOLE LOT 
OF RESPECT. 
WE TALK A LOT ABOUT WHAT PEOPLE 
ARE GOING TO BE TALKING A LOT 
ABOUT, REMINDING VOTERS ABOUT 
THE 2008 CAMPAIGN WHERE THE 
WOMAN SAID SHE COULD NOT TRUST 
BARACK OBAMA BECAUSE HE WAS A 
MUSLIM. 
HE CORRECTED HER ON THAT POINT 
AND MOVED ON. 
OBVIOUSLY, FIERCE OPPONENTS, A 
LOT OF RESPECT. 
>> AS MANY PEOPLE WOULD SAY, 
THAT'S OLD SCHOOL AMERICAN 
POLITICS. 
TWO MEN GOING ON IT AT THE 
CAMPAIGN TRAIL. 
WINTER WINDS, LOSER LOSES, THEY 
MOVE ON AND WORK TOGETHER. 
WE WANT TO CONTINUE OUR 
COVERAGE, OVER AT SENATOR JOHN 
McCAIN'S OFFICE.  
KIM PAUL IS STANDING BY LIVE 
FOR US OUTSIDE OF HIS OFFICE. 
KIM? 
>> Reporter: RIGHT BEHIND ME IS 
WHERE HE SERVED THE AMERICAN 
PEOPLE AND PEOPLE OF ARIZONA 
FOR THE LAST SEVERAL OTHERS. 
HE SETTLED HERE IN OUR STATE IN 
1982 AND SERVED IN CONGRESS FOR 
4 YEARS UNTIL IN 1986 HE WON 
THE SENATE OFFICE. 
THAT MEANS HE HAS BEEN SERVING 
ARIZONA IN THE SENATE FOR THE 
LAST 31 YEARS. 
A CLEAR STAPLE. SO FAR WE 
HAVEN'T SEEN ANYONE COME BY HIS 
OFFICE JUST YET BUT WE TALKED 
TO A SECURITY GUARD THAT TOLD 
US THEY DID NOT WANT US TO COME 
INSIDE AT THIS TIME. 
COMPLETELY UNDERSTANDABLE OF 
COURSE. 
WE DO ANTICIPATE THAT MANY MORE 
PEOPLE WILL COME BY AS NEWS 
SPREADS OF HIS PASSING AND THEY 
PAY RESPECT TO THE SENATOR. 
FOR NOW, I WILL SEND IT BACK TO 
YOU GUYS BUT WE WILL KEEP YOU 
UPDATED. 
>> THAT IS KIM PAUL. 
YOU WILL BE STATIONED FOR THE 
REMAINDER OF THE NIGHT. 
LET US KNOW IF YOU GET REACTION 
FROM CONSTITUENTS IN ARIZONA, 
SHOWING THEIR RESPECTS. 
I'M SURE AT SOME POINT PEOPLE 
WILL MAKE THEIR WAY OVER TO 
JOHN McCAIN'S OFFICE. 
WE DO WANT TO GET NEW OUR 
COVERAGE OF SENATOR JOHN 
McCAIN. 
THE NAVY LIEUTENANT COMMANDER 
JOHN McCAIN WAS HELD CAPTIVE IN 
VIETNAM FROM 1967 UNTIL 1973 
AFTER HIS PLANE WENT DOWN. 
>> HE BROKE HIS LEG AND BOTH 
ARMS AND WAS HELD IN A 
VIETNAMESE HOSPITAL. 
MORGAN LOWE HAS A LOOK AT HIS 
TIME. 
>> WHAT IS YOUR NAME? 
>>  LIEUTENANT COMMANDER JOHN 
McCAIN. 
>> Reporter: OLDEST FILM CLIP 
OF JOHN McCAIN AS A SERIOUSLY 
INJURED P.O.W. 
IN VIETNAM THAT CREATED THE 
U.S.  VIEW OF HIM AS BOTH A 
HERO AND A CASUALTY OF WAR. 
AFTER BEING SHOT DOWN OVER 
HANOI, McCAIN SPENT 5 1/2 YEARS 
IN THE NOTORIOUS HANOI HILTON 
PRISON, WHERE HE WAS ROUTINELY 
BEATEN AND TORTURED. 
>> DOES HE EVER TALK ABOUT 
THIS? 
>> THAT'S A GOOD QUESTION. 
>> Reporter: GRANT WOODS NEW 
McCAIN FOR 35 YEARS. 
>> HE DOES NOT TALK ABOUT IT 
MUCH. 
I HAVE PROBABLY HAD THOUSANDS 
OF CONVERSATIONS WITH JOHN 
McCAIN MY WHOLE LIFE. 
AND AN IN DEPTH SERIOUS TALK 
ABOUT HIS TIME AS A PRISONER OF 
WAR, PROBABLY A HALF A DOZEN. 
HE JUST DOES NOT REALLY TALK 
ABOUT IT TOO MUCH. 
>> Reporter: BUT, WOODS 
BELIEVES THAT THE TIME AND 
HANOI SHAPED THE REST OF HIS 
LIFE. 
>> I THINK THAT THE PRISONER OF 
WAR EXPERIENCE GALVANIZE FOR 
HIM, THE EXPERIENCE  AND 
IMPORTANC TO HAVE A LIFETIME 
OF SERVICE TO THE UNITED 
STATES. 
>> Reporter: WHEN HE WAS 
RELEASED, HE SERVED AS A 
LIAISON TO THE U.S. SENATE, THE 
BEGINNING OF A NEW CAREER IN 
POLITICS. 
ONE OF A HANDFUL OF VIETNAM 
VETERANS WHO BECAME POLITICIANS.
BUT, McCAIN WAS DIFFERENT. 
>> HE EXPERIENCED THE WAR IN A 
VERY DIFFERENT WAY THAN ALMOST 
ANYONE. 
>> Reporter: KYLE LONGLEY IS A 
POLITICAL SCIENCE AND HISTORY 
PROFESSOR AT ARIZONA STATE 
UNIVERSITY. 
>> SITTING IN HANOI HILTON FOR 
THAT LONG AND REFUSING TO BE 
RELEASED AT POINTS WHERE HE 
COULD HAVE BEEN WHICH WAS A 
GREAT ACT OF BRAVERY, OR 
SACRIFICE, IS GOING TO, YOU 
KNOW, SHAPE YOUR WORLDVIEW. 
>> Reporter: HE SAYS McCAIN 
BECAME A HAWK. 
SOMEONE WHO BELIEVED THAT WHEN 
THERE WAS A CONFLICT INVOLVING 
AMERICAN TROOPS, AMERICA NEEDED 
TO BE ALL IN. 
>> HE WALKED AWAY LIKE MANY 
VIETNAM VETERANS. 
THINKING, IF WE HAD JUST BEEN 
GIVEN THE RESOURCES, IF WE HAD 
JUST BEEN GIVEN SUPPORT BACK 
HOME, WE COULD HAVE BEEN MORE 
SUCCESSFUL. 
>> Reporter: THROUGHOUT HIS 
YEARS IN THE SENATE AND DURING 
HIS UNSUCCESSFUL RUNS FOR THE 
PRESIDENCY, McCAIN DISPLAYED A 
MAVERICK STREAK YOU CAN TRACE 
BACK TO HIS DAYS AS A NAVAL 
AVIATOR. 
HE ALSO REJECTED TORTURE OF ANY 
KIND BY THE U.S. GOVERNMENT. 
A CONVICTION HE DEVELOPED IN 
THAT PRISON IN VIETNAM. 
>> LIEUTENANT COMMANDER JOHN 
McCAIN. 
>> HE HAS LIVED ONE OF THE 
GREAT AMERICAN LIVES. 
I MEAN, I JUST LOOK AT 
EVERYTHING HE HAS DONE. 
AND THERE IS VERY FEW PEOPLE IN 
OUR COUNTRY'S HISTORY WHO HAVE 
HAD THE LIFE HE'S HAD. 
IT'S PRETTY REMARKABLE. 
>> THAT WAS MORGAN LOWE 
REPORTING.  
TONIGHT, WE HAVE MORE 
STATEMENTS COMING IN, MORE 
REACTION COMING INTO OUR 
NEWSROOM. 
CONGRESSWOMAN ANNA KIRKPATRICK 
TWEETING OUT A STATEMENT TODAY, 
SAYING THIS, ALL OF THE 
POWERFUL ACTIONS AND 
INFLUENTIAL WORDS OF SENATOR 
McCAIN'S CAREER BOILED DOWN TO 
A SIMPLE PHRASE, COUNTRY FIRST. 
SHE ADDED, "McCAIN DEDICATED 
HIS LIFE TO KEYWORD TO 
DEFENDING AND ENHANCING OUR 
DEMOCRACY. 
SENATOR McCAIN PUSHED ASIDE 
PARTISAN POLITICS WHEN IT 
CHALLENGE THE CONSTITUTIONAL 
PROCESS AND OUR AMERICAN 
VALUES. 
HE MAY HAVE BEEN MY TOUGHEST 
OPPONENT AT ONE TIME. 
HOWEVER, HIS RESPECT AND 
DEDICATION TO PUBLIC SERVICE 
AND HIS LOVE FOR ARIZONA IS 
SOMETHING I STRONGLY ADMIRE." 
SHE ALSO GOES ON TO SAY THAT 
THE STATE OF ARIZONA IS SO 
LUCKY TO HAVE HIM REPRESENT ALL 
OF US. 
REST IN PEACE, MAVERICK. 
>> SO VERY TRUE. 
WE ARE ALSO GETTING WORD RIGHT 
NOW FROM THE SPEAKER OF THE 
HOUSE, JD MESSNER. 
AND HE SENT OUT THIS TWEET 
SAYING, "ARIZONA HAS LOST A 
RELENTLESS WARRIOR. 
OUR NATION HAS LOST A STEADFAST 
DEFENDER AND THE WORLD HAS LOST 
A BEACON OF DEMOCRACY. 
HE FIERCELY FOUGHT TO PROTECT 
AND EXPAND FREEDOM AROUND THE 
GLOBE, AND HIS LEGACY IS A 
LIFETIME OF COURAGE AND PUBLIC 
SERVICE. 
#RESTINPEACE, JOHN McCAIN." 
>> THESE ARE TWO OPPONENTS ON 
FAR POLITICAL SIZE OF THE 
SPECTRUM.  
>> I WAS GOING TO SAY, REALLY 
STRONG WORDS AND ELEGANT WORDS 
FROM A MAN, FROM BOTH SIDES OF 
THE AISLE. 
THESE ARE AUTHENTIC. 
THESE ARE NOT JUST TRITE 
PLATITUDES THAT THEY ARE 
TWEETING OUT. 
THIS IS VERY AUTHENTIC. 
I READ A TWEET, AND I'M 
PARAPHRASING FROM A "NEW YORK 
TIMES" REPORTER. 
HE SAID BASICALLY, JOHN McCAIN 
WASN'T PERFECT BUT THE THING 
THAT MADE HIM GREAT WAS, HE 
KNEW HE WASN'T. 
>> HE ADMITTED IT OFTEN TIMES. 
>> AN IMPERFECT MAN. 
>> HE ADMITTED IT OFTEN TIMES. 
I DON'T KNOW IF YOU HAD THE 
OPPORTUNITY TO WATCH THE HBO 
SPECIAL THAT THEY DID ON HIM, A 
BIOGRAPHY. 
"JOHN McCAIN" FOR WHOM THE 
BELLS WILL POLE." 
ANYHOW, THEY ARE TALKING ABOUT 
WHEN HE WAS TAKEN CAPTIVE, AND 
HOW HE CHOSE TO STAY IN, 
BECAUSE HE KNEW THEY WOULD USE 
IT FOR PROPAGANDA, OFTEN TIMES 
ASKING HIM AND REMINDING HIM 
AND QUESTIONING HIM, WHO IS 
YOUR FATHER AGAIN? 
WHO IS YOUR FATHER AGAIN? 
BUT HE SAYS WHEN HE ACCEPTED 
THE REPUBLICAN NOMINATION FOR 
PRESIDENT, MY COUNTRY SAVED ME 
AND I CANNOT FORGET IT. 
I WILL FIGHT FOR HER AS LONG AS 
I DRAW A BREATH, SO HELP ME 
GOD. 
THAT'S BASICALLY HOW HE LIVED 
HIS LIFE. 
AND IT TALKS ABOUT HOW, 
REMEMBER, THIS WAS THE GRANDSON 
AND THE SON OF A NAVAL OFFICER. 
AND WHEN YOU SERVE TO THAT 
HIGHEST DEGREE, HONOR IS THE 
BOTTOM LINE THERE. 
>> IF YOU THINK ABOUT THE 
EXPECTATIONS OF BEING THE 
GRANDSON AND THE SON OF TWO 
NAVY ADMIRALS, THE EXPECTATIONS 
PUT UPON YOU, I THINK YOU CAN 
LOOK BACK AND SEE THAT HE 
EXCEEDED THOSE EXPECTATIONS. 
>> GROWING UP, HE WAS A BIT OF 
A REBEL. 
>> HE WAS A REBEL BEING 
INVOLVED AS A MAVERICK. 
HE ALWAYS HAD A REBEL IN HIM. 
AND HE ENJOYED IT. 
HE ENJOYED RUFFLING THE 
FEATHERS, A THE CAPITAL AND IN 
CONGRESS, AND THINGS AND SUCH. 
BUT AS YOU SO MENTIONED, THAT 
IS HIS LIFE. 
WHAT WE SAW AS A PRISONER OF 
WAR AND HIM SAYING, NO, DO NOT 
LET HIM RELEASE ME UNLESS YOU 
ARE GOING TO RELEASE ALL OF MY 
MEN. 
HE WAS GOING TO STAY IN THE 
TRENCHES WITH HIS MEN. 
THAT IS THE TRUE EMBODIMENT OF 
THE MAN WHO SENATOR JOHN McCAIN 
IS. 
BY THE WAY,  JOHN McCAIN FIRST 
BECAME KNOWN TO AMERICANS WHEN 
HE WAS TAKEN AGAIN AS A 
PRISONER OF WAR IN VIETNAM. 
>> A REPORTER TRAVEL TO HANOI 
AND FOUND McCAIN TICKET TIME IS 
ETCHED IN THE COUNTRY'S 
HISTORY. 
>> Reporter: YOU CAN HEAR THE 
HUSTLE AND BUSTLE OF HANOI 
AROUND US. 
THIS IS WHERE JOHN McCAIN 
CRASHED IN 1967. 
HE WAS ON A MISSION, TRYING TO 
TAKE DOWN A POWER PLANT OUTSIDE 
OF HANOI WHEN HIS PLANE WAS HIT.
HE ENDED UP HERE SHOOTING INTO 
THIS LAKE. 
HE WAS BADLY INJURED. 
HE HAD A NUMBER OF BROKEN BONES 
AND A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO 
HAPPENED TO BE IN THIS AREA SAW 
HIM LAND IN THE WATER. 
THEY DID NOT TRY TO HELP HIM. 
THEY BEAT HIM SEVERELY AND THEN 
PULLED HIM OUT OF THE WATER. 
McCAIN WAS TAKEN ON A SHORT 
DRIVE THROUGH WHAT ARE NOW 
KNOWN AS CRAZY, CROWDED STREETS 
IN HANOI, TO A NEARBY PRISON, 
WHICH U.S. P.O.W.s NICKNAMED, 
THE HANOI HILTON. 
MOST OF THE OLD PRISON COMPLEX 
HAS BEEN TORN DOWN.  
THE REMAINING PART HAS BEEN 
TURNED INTO A MUSEUM WHICH 
REALLY WHITE WASHES OVER A LOT 
OF THE TORTURE AND MISTREATMENT 
OF THE P.O.W.s.  
JOHN McCAIN'S FLIGHT SUIT AND 
HIS PARACHUTE ARE ON DISPLAY 
INSIDE. 
HIS GEAR IS DAMAGED, BUT INTACT 
AFTER ALL THESE YEARS. 
IT'S ENCASED IN A ROOM FULL OF 
VIETNAMESE PROPAGANDA. 
VIDEOS CLAIMING KIND TREATMENT 
OF THE POWS, AND PHOTOS SHOWING 
AMERICAN CAPTIVES, CELEBRATING 
HOLIDAYS, AND PLAYING SPORTS. 
>> A LOT OF McCAIN'S TIME WAS 
SPENT IN SOLITARY CONFINEMENT. 
WHEN THE NORTH VIETNAMESE 
REALIZED HIS FATHER HAD BEEN 
ELEVATED TO A NAVAL COMMANDER, 
THEY OFFERED TO RELEASE McCAIN. 
HE REFUSED TO LEAVE THE OTHER 
P.O.W.s BEHIND AND ENDED UP 
SPENDING FIVE AND HALF YEARS  
BEHIND THIS PRISON. 
>> Reporter: SOME OF THESE 
SMALL, DARK CELLS WERE 
PRESERVED. 
IT'S UNCLEAR WHETHER McCAIN 
SPENT ANY TIME IN ANY OF THE 
CELLS, WHICH STILL STAND HERE 
TODAY. 
JOHN McCAIN FIRST RETURNED HERE 
IN 1985 AND HE HAS COME BACK 
MANY TIMES THROUGH THE YEARS 
AND HAS BECOME A HUGE PROPONENT 
OF OPENING UP RELATIONS BETWEEN 
VIETNAM AND THE UNITED STATES. 
AND BACK HERE AT THE LAKE 
McCAIN PARACHUTE, THERE IS ONE 
MEMORIAL TO HIM. 
HIS NAME IS RIGHT HERE ON THIS 
MEMORIAL ON ONE OF THE BRIDGES. 
THIS LAKE IS A BEAUTIFUL SPOT, 
AGAIN, RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE OF 
HANOI. 
IT IS SURROUNDED BY A LOT OF 
FAMILIES IN DIFFERENT PARKS, A 
LOT OF RESTAURANTS. 
A LOT HAS CHANGED HERE IN THE 
LAST 50 YEARS. 
IN HANOI, VIETNAM, I'M JERRY 
DEALING HIM FOR ARIZONA'S 
FAMILY. 
>> WHAT A FASCINATING STORY. 
WHEN JERRY DEALING HIM TOLD OUR 
BOSSES HE WAS HEADING TO 
VIETNAM AND HE GOT THERE AND 
SAID, FOLKS, THERE IS AN 
INCREDIBLE MUSEUM, DESIGNATED TO
SENATOR JOHN McCAIN AND WHAT HE 
WENT THROUGH. 
I GOT TO SHOOT A STORY ON THAT. 
THAT IS THE STORY HE FILED. 
>> GREAT WORK THERE BUT IT ALSO 
SHOWS, WE TALKED ABOUT HOW HE 
MADE FRIENDS. 
HIS POLITICAL ENEMIES. 
LOOK, HE LED THE WAY. 
JOHN McCAIN WAS VERY INSTRUMENT 
IN NORMALIZING RELATIONS WITH 
VIETNAM AFTER THAT REALLY 
CONTENTIOUS CHAPTER, AND DARK 
CHAPTER. 
BOTH HE AND JOHN KERRY DID 
THAT. 
THEY LED THE WAY ON THAT. 
>> YOU KNOW, THAT TALKS ABOUT 
HOW HE CONTINUED TO REACH 
ACROSS THE AISLE. 
HERE IS JOHN KERRY, HERE IS 
JOHN McCAIN. 
THEY BOTH STOOD ON DIFFERENT 
SIDES OF THE VIETNAM WAR, AND 
THEY DECIDED THEY WERE GOING TO 
FORGE IT FORWARD AND THEY WERE 
GOING TO FIX THE PROBLEM. 
AND, AND, YOU KNOW, WHAT THEY 
CALLED A DARK PLACE IN HISTORY. 
AND, JOHN McCAIN APPARENTLY 
GOING TO PRESIDENT TRUMP AND 
SAYING, LISTEN, I'M TIRED OF 
THIS STAYING NOT ONLY ON THE 
COUNTRY BUT MY LIFE AS WELL. 
THAT'S WHEN CHANGE GAME. 
>> THAT'S A MUTUAL RESPECT 
BETWEEN SENATOR JOHN KERRY AND 
JOHN McCAIN, SAYING, WE BOTH 
SERVED OUR COUNTRY VERY PROUDLY.
WE MAY HAVE DIFFERENT 
FUNDAMENTAL VIEWS OF WHERE WE 
WANT THIS COUNTRY TO GO BUT 
LET'S FIND OURSELVES IN THE 
COMMONALITY OF WHAT WE 54 IN 
THIS COUNTRY AND THE LOVE FOR 
THIS COUNTRY. 
JOHN McCAIN SAID, IF WE FOCUS, 
ALL OF US HAVE OUR DIFFERENCES. 
BUT IF WE FOCUS ON OUR 
SIMILARITIES AND THE LOVE WE 
HAVE FOR THIS COUNTRY, WE CAN 
WORK TOGETHER AND GET SOMETHING 
DONE. 
THAT'S THE LEGACY THAT JOHN 
McCAIN ALWAYS PREACHED. 
WE CAN HAVE OUR DIFFERENCES. 
LET'S FIND THE THINGS WE AGREE 
ON AND TRY TO WORK TOGETHER. 
>> IN THE ENORMITY OF 
EVERYTHING THAT IS JOHN McCAIN, 
SOMETIMES YOU FORGET ALL THE 
THINGS THAT HE DID. 
I THINK NORMALIZING RELATIONS 
HEALED THE WOUND AGAIN. 
THAT WAS A DARK CHAPTER IN 
AMERICAN LIFE. 
HE NEARLY TORE THE COUNTRY 
APART. 
AND I THINK NORMALIZING THOSE 
RELATIONSHIPS DID A LOT TO HEAL 
THE COUNTRY AND MEANT A LOT TO 
THE PEOPLE THAT SERVED OVER 
THERE. 
>> WE AGAIN HAVE MORE REACTION 
COMING INTO OUR NEWSROOM. 
RESPONSES FROM ACROSS THE 
COUNTRY AND OUR NATION. 
THIS ONE COMING FROM SENATOR 
LINDSEY GRAHAM. 
HE SAYS THAT AMERICA AND 
FREEDOM HAVE LOST ONE OF HER 
GREATEST CHAMPIONS, AND I HAVE 
LOST ONE OF MY DEAREST FRIENDS 
AND MENTORS. 
>> ALSO GETTING REACTION THIS 
AFTERNOON FROM DEMOCRATIC 
CANDIDATE FOR DISTRICT 8 SAYING,
QUOTE, FOR OVER THREE DECADES, 
SENATOR JOHN McCAIN SERVED THE 
PEOPLE OF ARIZONA IN CONGRESS 
WITH GREAT COURAGE AND POISE. 
HE SERVED THE AMERICAN PEOPLE 
EVEN LONGER, AND REDEFINED, 
QUOTE, MAVERICK FOR THE MODERN 
ERA. 
SENATOR McCAIN HAS MORE THOUGH 
SHE WAS MORE THAN A POLITICIAN. 
HE WAS A HERO. 
AS HIS MANY YEARS OF SERVICE 
LEFT AN INDELIBLE MARK ON OUR 
COUNTRY. 
I HEART GOES OUT TO HIS LOVED 
ONES AS THEY MOURN HIS 
TREMENDOUS LOSS TO OUR STATE, 
NATION, AND WORLD. 
>> AND,  REPRESENTATIVE 
CONGRESSMAN ANDY BIGGS JUST 
TWEETED OUT, CINDY AND I OFFER 
OUR SINCEREST CONDOLENCES TO 
THE McCAIN FAMILY ON THE 
PASSING OF SENATOR JOHN McCAIN, 
AN AMERICAN WAR  HERO.
