when the mainstay of an economy is farming you might expect it to be reassured that it's safe in a changing world but apparently not the border between north and islands and the Republic is 15 kilometers down the road and cross-border trade is crucial yet there has been no agriculture minister in northern ireland's for nearly a year brexit is knocking on the door the farmers have come to look at politicians as like these sheep leaderless and quite stupid it is hugely frustrating with a thought minister in place to make the final decision and to be sitting around that table getting the point across about the importance of northern ireland agriculture it is frustrating to recap the former leader of the irish nationalist shin Fane party collapsed the government it's shared with the pro-british unionists a year ago when their problems became too difficult to resolve since then the two sides have refused to compromise it means in the government buildings in Belfast the lights are on but nobody's home no major piece of local legislation or work in Northern Ireland can happen there is no sign of a resolution it's only 14 months until this province is on the front line of a UK outside the European Union everything here has gone wrong at once but people voted to stay in the European Union but the UK is leaving anyway the government fell apart and after a year shows no sign of being able to get back together the UK government has proved incapable of sorting it out let alone the much greater issue of what's going to happen to the border between northern and southern Ireland's and all that volatility that sense of vacuum is very dangerous for a province that's not really at peace with itself predictably nationalists who want a united Ireland and hate the idea of borders here are looking to Dublin to help them 200 leading nationalist figures have written a joint letter to the Irish Prime Minister urging him to intervene by virtue of the fact that there is a constitutional vacuum at the only considered conclusion for but is that there is a risk to the peace process caused by British caused by Bragg's it but as with everything here the same argument cuts both ways unionists argue that a violent is helping the Nationalists then they need London to support them it is very unnerving for unionists and I think that there is an irony in this a very deep irony that the ADEA P were the loudest voice in Northern Ireland calling for breaks it they are no the party which faces deep uncertainty as a result of breaks it and what was once an absolutely and cast-iron guarantee it seemed for at least a generation that Northern Ireland would remain British is no longer quite as certain as it seemed the Good Friday Agreement is 20 years old in April the treaty which officially ended the sectarian war here has guaranteed the peace since then but brexit has thrown it into doubt London and Dublin between them need to cut through the fog at the moment nobody has any idea how Laurence Lee al Jazeera Belfast
