I've just landed in Warsaw in Poland because I think there's a story here that we need to tell it's not the story that the mainstream media wants to tell you they've been lying about Poland for years about three years ago when the Lauren justice party took control of the Polish government the media began a smear campaign saying that the Polish people and the Polish country was racist and nationalistic even that you got involved in called Poland races for not wanting to take in millions of Syrian refugees so-called Syrian refugees the story here isn't that Poland is racist the story is that the people are waking up after years of communism they're waking up and realizing that the way forward is being proud in one's own nation-state and specifically it's the Polish youth the Polish youth are voting in bigger numbers than ever they're voting for conservative and right-wing parties and actually political polls are showing time and time again that the Polish youth want to vote for right or center-right parties and I want to find out why I want to show you the real story not the story that the mainstream media is peddling so I'm going to look at three things during this series of videos I'm going to look at the historical patriotism of the Polish youth the cultural patriotism of the Polish youth and the political patriotism of the Polish youth this is the real story will you help me cover our modest expenses for hotel airfare and cabs will you help us raise a thousand pounds to cover this important work please go to rebel Poland calm thanks so much for your support you
