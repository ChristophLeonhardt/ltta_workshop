Trump is set to meet with NATO allies later this week in fact he will be meeting with them tomorrow in order to discuss the future of NATO and and many of our allies are concerned about that because Trump has been incredibly combative and has accused some of our allies of not paying their fair share into the program so as he has prepared for the Brussels summit or the meeting with NATO allies Trump has accused Europe of exploiting the United States and hinted that he might play the role of agitator at NATO sowing disagreement among allies so wonder who that would help well it's it's amazing because like while he's facing this Russia investigation regardless of what you believe you know Trump's role was inclusion whether or not you think there's any legitimacy to that investigation you have to at least admit that Trump constantly you know saying positive things about Putin is a bad idea and in the context of this NATO story he keeps saying very nice things about Putin he keeps complimenting him and talking about how it's easier to talk to Putin than it is to talk to NATO allies now I have videos that I want to share with you to prove this point this is all part of the same press conference first let's take a look at what Trump has to say about our NATO allies NATO has not treated it fairly but I think we'll work something out we pay far too much and they pay far too little but we will work it out and all countries will be happy it's all countries will be happy oh good to hear he keeps conflating you know trade issues with international security issues yeah and so an expert from Europe said it feels like a mob shakedown now we could give you security if you were to pay the right amount right now but I want to be clear there's two different issues here that tying in exactly right what Anna said tie in security with the tariffs is a terrible idea on the other hand he's there is one thing he's right about so the the rest of the allies are not putting in what they promised they would put into NATO so if you want to put pressure on them to pay their fair share aight i get that and and others might disagree but i understand that I would hope that there's a constructive way of doing that and I know that you would have to do a little bit of stake along with carrots to get them to do that and then there's a destructive way of doing that and of course we present to you Donald Trump yeah bull in a china shop so let me give you the specifics on that because I agree with you that Trump is right in wanting to hold some of these countries accountable for holding up their promise back in 2014 our allied countries said that they would spend about 2% of their gross domestic product for NATO and that has not happened so he specifically calls out Germany Germany promised to do this and they are not doing it in fact the new promise that Germany has made is that they will pay about 1.5 percent of their gross domestic product into NATO by 2024 so I get it I understand the frustrations of Trump and you know credit where credit is due however the way he handles it is so incredibly destructive a smart negotiator does it in a way that doesn't further alienate the country from our allies and that's exactly what he's doing he does it in a very public way he runs his mouth on Twitter he runs his mouth in these press conferences these are your allies so negotiate with them if you have friends just think about it on a small scale where you're having some sort of financial issue with your friends your friend promised to pay 50% of the dinner but didn't end up doing it are you gonna go on social media and be like yo rod is not paying me the fair share of that dinner I can't believe rod and then you go and turn around and talk to rods enemy who also happened to be your enemy at some point you're like hey you know what Stacey I love you Stacey you're so much easier to talk to Stacey in a public way that's what children do you've got rot aside and you say hey come on we made this promise let's make it work right but even if you said no kick Ron's ass he owes me the money I don't care I'll humiliate him publicly congratulations that's who you are but anyway that's fine okay but then the extra step is where he you can't possibly defend him so they're saying that he now is considering they're worried nato's worried that he's gonna come in there and go we should lift the sanctions on Russia for taking a crack at Crimea from Ukraine well okay wait a minute but that doesn't have anything new with paying their bills that's just helping Russia for no reason at all right and and then he called Putin after his so-called win in the elections where he didn't let his opponents run against them an obvious sham election every one of his aides that works in a very right-wing White House for like mr. president do not congratulate him on the victory it was a sham election so he gets on the phone he goes some stupid people told me not to congratulate you oh yeah he called Trump this is in March of this year and when against his aids which okay fine but then proceeded to badmouth his aides and call them stupid people while talking to Putin so again it's not even just NATO and it's not for a specific purpose he even attacks his own friends within his White House his own staff within the White House and says Putin don't worry I'm not on the side of the my own staff or my own allies I'm on your side congratulations great job on that election victory probably he thinks hey can you teach me a lesson or two about how to fix election I mean we can I make sure that none of my opponents run against me like you do Vladimir his aides urged him not to call Putin and congratulate him for getting reelected right because it was a sham election I mean for Trump like where's the flaw there yeah he's like well that sounds amazing yeah like he said about Kim jong-un he says when he says to do something his people stand up I wish they did the same thing here well the way that Kim jong-un does that is by putting them in concentration camps if they don't stand up don't give him any ideas okay so now in the same press conference as he is berating our allies he moves on to Putin now he is going to meet with Putin a few days after the meeting with NATO and here's what he has to say about his upcoming conversation with Putin okay what do you mean you would think it's been really easy for you to talk to him for all this time that you've been helping him money launderers so super super easy for you to talk to him he's your buddy right I mean note that's the thing about Trump no tact no subtlety no nuance he's of cars driving Putin is easy to talk to my allies I want to rip them apart and make sure they can't defend themselves against Putin but Putin I really like oh did I say that out loud yeah you did you basically did right you said you said the Putin part you see you attacked our allies if he's not the Siberian candidate Putin's gotta be thinking how did I get this lucky an American president who loves me for no reason once the lift of sanctions once they give me Crimea in the shoulders they speak Russian anyway makes my case for me and rips my enemies to shreds who are supposed to be his allies if it's not some sort of cooperation Putin's the luckiest guy in the world two
