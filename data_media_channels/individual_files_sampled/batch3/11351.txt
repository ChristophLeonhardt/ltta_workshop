muscles are sweating a bit more than usual these days and it's all because Italy's new Euroskeptic government doesn't intend on playing by the use rules it is important to abide by budget discipline and especially for Italy to continue to reduce the deficit it is important to stay on track being a good Italian also means being a good European citizen it needs to be repeated out loud especially now the left-wing 5 star movement and the right-wing northern league party formerly fringe now turned government majorities are promising italians a government of change confronting the EU on immigration austerity and taxation we've told this to everyone even on a European level that from now on the Italians come first the new government's plan for Italy and Europe is everything Brussels doesn't want people before economic obligations as a senior official of the Northern League described it they're demanding a debt discount an expansion of welfare programs and a reduction of taxes which would be a big blow to the use wallet Italy is also telling Brussels it's had enough bearing the burden of the migrant crisis on top of that they're challenging something that's been a constant in the EU s foreign policy for some years by saying drop the sanctions against Russia last time Brussels saw a similar rebellion was when an anti-establishment party took the reigns in Greece when an anti-austerity syriza party came to power what a headache it was for the EU we agreed to disagree as dr. Sharples said we didn't reach an agreement it was never on the cards that we would we didn't even agree to disagree from where I'm standing but the Greek experience could hardly have been considered a win for Euroskeptics cereza bowed under pressure and agreed to a renewed austerity program in Italy it seems both parties of the government coalition are getting along so far after they finalized their program they'll just need approval from the Italian president if approved it would be the first GU founder state to be ruled Euroskeptic government and that's starting to give Brussels bigger worries than it originally had we have to brace ourselves for the worst scenario and the worst scenario could be no operational government as if the absence of a government in Italy seemed bad enough for the EU it could be soon contending with a major member state in all-out rebellion Donald quarter RT Italy's main stock market though reacted negatively as the political program contains a number of sweeping economic proposals representative of the likely centre-right coalition told us such radical plans are vital for modern Italy we came to the point with a final contract that is including the most important things from the two parts we need this to come down also the country and be able to stay into the European Union in a strong way we are very focused on the democracy of our country the reuleaux we respect our alliances we want to be a part of the EU being stronger as Italy
