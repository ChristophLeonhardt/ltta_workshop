the United States pulls out of the UN Human Rights Council calling it a cesspool of political bias so what will this mean for the global fight to protect human rights and will this further isolate the US on the world stage this is inside story hello and welcome to the program I'm Peter Dhabi the US has walked out of the UN Human Rights Council calling it hypocritical self-serving and a cesspool of political bias the move follows months of threats from President Donald Trump to pull out of the UN Council the United States as long had a conflicted relationship with the UN HRC and says it has to be reformed the announcement came at a time when President Trump faces widespread and vociferous condemnation for his zero-tolerance immigration policy that's separating children from their families on the us-mexico border we'll get to our guests in a moment but first for Inside Story Roz Jordan has this report a year ago the US ambassador to the United Nations criticized the UN Human Rights Council from what she called it's hypocritical behavior and nikki Haley said the US would quit the council if it didn't change its ways it's hard to accept that this council has never considered a resolution on Venezuela and yet it adopted five biased resolutions in March against a single country Israel it is essential that this council address its chronic anti-israel bias if it is to have any credibility it is correct to criticize the State of Israel for its actions as said by rabbi Lance you can you can challenge the Israeli government's policies without being anti-semitic comments such as this a permanent agenda item investigating Israel's treatment of Palestinians and the u.s. is recent failure to prevent the UN General Assembly from condemning Israel's use of force in Gaza finally made the Trump administration say enough on Tuesday but when organizations undermine our national interests and our allies we will not be complicit when they seek to infringe on our national sovereignty we will not be silent we take this step because our commitment does not allow us to remain a part of a hypocritical and self-serving organization that makes a mockery of human rights we could have withdrawn immediately we did not do that instead we made a good-faith effort to resolve the problems the US has had a troubled relationship with the council when it was set up in 2006 President George Bush refused to join because he feared countries with poor human rights records would be able to sit on a panel intended to punish human rights violators key and Bush's decision-making the US ambassador to the UN at the time John Bolton he's now president Trump's national security adviser President Barack Obama then joined to the council in 2009 he argued the US would have more influence and give Israel more protection from negative resolutions in the process now the u.s. is leaving the council again and that has human rights groups around the world very concerned they fear that without the American presence on the council it will be much less able to hold countries such as Russia Syria or North Korea accountable for the mistreatment of their citizens it's also not clear how long Washington plans to stay away from the Human Rights Council Rosalynn Jordan al Jazeera the State Department well the council is based in Geneva and its mission is to promote and to protect human rights around the world it was established back in 2006 to replace the UN Commission on Human Rights that had been strongly criticized for allowing countries with poor human rights records to be members the UN HRC has 47 member countries who serve for three-year terms it meets three times a year and investigates human rights records of all UN member states in a special process it covers issues including freedom of expression freedom of belief women's rights LGBT rights and the rights of racial and ethnic minorities the UN General Assembly can suspend the rights of any council member that's violated human rights in a gross and systematic way this requires a two-thirds majority vote let's get going let's bring in our guest joining us from Geneva Gyan Cheryl he's the director of independent diplomat in London we have Rosa Friedman professor of law and global development to the University of reading and joining us from Washington is Mohammed chat a cop professor of conflict resolution at the George Mason University welcome to all Keyon coming to you first what does this decision do to the organization well the decision is not really one that comes as a surprise in Geneva everyone that's been following the Human Rights Council in Geneva has been expecting it ever since nikki Haley came to Geneva in June of last year and said that in essence she wanted the council to reform around three pillars the first one is its membership the second one is its perceived bias on it towards Israel and the third one is its efficiency I think that here the the shock is really the surprise is really that it comes so suddenly in a way even though we had seen it coming most would have expected that that be a trigger say for instance the UN publishing a report condemning Israel or something of the kind but in any case I think most people expected it and and the biggest concern nowadays is what you know how this is going to unfold a year and a half away from the reform of the Human Rights Council the Human Rights Council itself is due to be reformed in 2020 and you know this withdrawal poses a lot of questions on that Rosa what does it also say about where the organization stands today and why didn't it react to those demands from nikki Haley to reform I think that there are many countries many NGOs that agree with the US about the need for reform it was the way that the US was going about trying to reform the body that I think caused this trigger this this reaction and this walking out in quite an immediate manner essentially the u.s. wanted to to sponsor resolutions on reform where is it these these things have to be cross regional they have to have co-sponsors and be championed by many countries and the way that the u.s. was pushing for reform was by floating resolutions without first garnering support and then reacting very badly when those floated resolutions were being pushed off the table and Muhammad what does it also tell us about the current direction of travel for the Trump administration well it is a dark day in the US history it contradicts all the morals and institutions that have been established either since the Puritan times in colonial America or according to the world Sounion a doctrine that gave us the League of Nations and then contributed to the establishment of the UN nation systems unfortunately the Trump administration now is exiting this global human right paradigm for the sake of being isolated isolated and also for showing some and called for sympathy to the Israelis so I think the problem here is that the United States is going to lose its main reference of moral politics human rights and all the humanity that it has championed over centuries Roza when Mohammed talks about uncalled for sympathy for the Israelis part of this as far as Nikki Haley's concerned is this article 7 which means that they always have to they are constituted in such a way they always have to talk about Israel at every meeting and that's why we've seen the reaction that we've seen today from Benjamin Netanyahu look ever since the council was created there has been biased there has been excessive disproportionate scrutiny of Israel we've seen that the UN Human Rights Council has spent more time and resources talking about Israel than it has about North Korea Yemen South Sudan Sudan and Darfur and Sri Lanka combined but that that bias it's not a perception that actual bias against Israel is not a reason to leave the Human Rights Council it is a reason to reform and work with the council and in fact when item 7 was first placed on the agenda the reason that it wasn't blocked by European Union States was it was hoped that the discussion of Israel and Palestine would be contained to those two days at the session since it is not contained to those two days and Israel is raised in all sorts of other agenda items many countries have simply stopped engaging with item 7 so there are ways around it and the u.s. knows that there are ways around it but this is almost a good excuse and a good national populist excuse for the u.s. walking out of the room you know what do you think the chances are that the United States might go back in again they left before under george w bush when he was a republican president but they chose under obama to join up and sign up to the statutes one more time i mean it's going to be difficult to predict but to be honest i don't foresee them coming back before 2020 so IE before the reforms are discussed and and and that there is a new that there is a new body or or or that the reforms are in place i think that the message is pretty clear in fact i think the big question is whether these reforms or whether this would allow for the u.s. to return at all and and I agree with what Rosa and and Mohammed have just said in many ways it creates a void I mean when you're trying to negotiate for a reform and you're not there in the room negotiating it creates a void and and and certain countries other countries are more than happy to fill that void and so far as I can see and my biggest concern is civil society the Human Rights Council has been one of the few UN avenues for engagement for civil society actors I I agree that I mean I I hear roses points with regards to the Israel bias and or or or the discussions that the wait that's giving them on the record human rights record of Israel but at the same time I must say that it's one of the very few conduits where we've had discussions on accountability at all at the UN I'm thinking and with the engagement of civil society I'm thinking you know it's had 28 Commission's of inquiry not just on Gaza but also on the Myanmar look at for instance Syria's one of the very few places where we've had so much you know there's been a independent investigative body looking into the the violations committed by the Syrian government there and so on so so this has provided for a room for civil society engagement like nowhere else I mean there's over probably a hundred probably thousand of NGOs active in there and the big fear is that this US withdrawal creating that void would allow certain other countries to fill it and these other countries which are coming to the fray I'm thinking for instance China with its win-win resolution which they tabled recently is it remains unknown as to how much space they would want to give to the NGOs I mean when I say unknown this is a diplomatic term I mean many countries the US was part of the groups of states that was favorable and supportive of the engagement of civil society actors so that that is probably one of the biggest question marks on that muhammad' in Washington if there is now a void and there clearly is on the ranks of within the ranks of the council those other countries that look to the United States to be the high-water mark of not just international law and how its applied but also the Nexus of morality international morality if you will and the law who do they look to now well before I address your question let me add couple of issues here I think we should not over credit the support for Israel in explaining or deconstructing this decision I think we should mention also that there is a personal there is also a political factor the personal factor is that from six to become the king that America had never had in other words he wants to free himself up from all these institutions and accountability also this decision can be considered as an investment in the right-wing evangelical base where he is basically telling them that you are better off with us as right-wingers and he is also taken into consideration this investment toward the elections next November at the Congress level and also later on in 2020 to address your question I think yes there will be a vacuum where there will be no leadership no point of reference and no a final kind of text or manifesto that sort of explains to the rest of the world that there is a system so basically this is the move beyond the establishment beyond the international institution that is the UN that has over cited this business of human rights otherwise in other words we are going to be moving on and that grounds in terms of what to do when some human rights are injured or encroached upon therefore the Trump administration is now while driving the world into the wilderness and the worst part here is that he is undermining the UN system if we do without or if we abandon this system then I think we become in a believe we will be living in a chaotic situation Rosa I think he wants to come in there I I'd like I'd like to come in there I think that we're overstating the case of the u.s. leaving the Human Rights Council and the impact that this will have on the council and on the whole UN system Trump has already taken money away from peacekeeping budget from the UN Population Fund from other parts of the United Nations system and other countries have stepped up to fill that void within the Human Rights Council the European Union is very strong the UK is very agile very effective with a very large mission and yes we will see a void by the u.s. not having its mission not having it its institutional knowledge and particularly its leadership on human rights but there are other countries we can look to particular Latin American countries who because of the geographic distance between them and Geneva don't always play as strong a role as perhaps we might want them to we can look to these countries and expect them to step up and fill the void and to push back against the countries like China who are trying to undermine human rights who are trying to say state sovereignty is more important or the countries like Egypt and India who block NGOs from being accredited to the UN system and I'm just a little bit worried that if we all say that the Human Rights Council will collapse as a result of the u.s. leaving we're actually we're actually forgetting that there are 193 member states and no one state is is more important than the remainder of them together well Donald Trump has pulled the u.s. out of several international agreements including the 2015 Iran nuclear deal which was reached with other world powers to curb Iran's nuclear program in exchange for easing sanctions the Paris climate Accord which is working to tackle global warming signed also in 2015 by 190 countries the US s also withdrawn from the Trans Pacific Partnership a 12-nation trade deal that covers almost 40% of the world's economy and the UN global agreement on migration the pledge is to uphold the rights of refugees and help them to resettle in another country Rosa can I come back to you though when you talk about that agility that's that's all well and good and we accept that of course but as the car has the time come for the council which it seems to me is like a work in progress almost they haven't quite got it right because you're all saying the same thing there are valid criticisms here but they did launch Commission's on North Korea South Sudan nothing came of that so the delivery of how they react to the information that they bring in is never pushed through well first of all we have to understand that the council is an intergovernmental body Member States send their diplomats to represent national interests and so it will always be a political body and it won't have legally binding powers that have soft powers unlike expert bodies that are more like quasi judicial powers the Commission's of inquiry the fact-finding the information sharing this has been a game changer for human rights unlike the previous body the Commission the Council meets throughout the year it is webcast anyone can access it members of the public NGOs it provides information that is used by the Security Council that's used by regional bodies because grave violations of human rights often are a precursor to threats to international peace and security we've seen so much positive work of the council and yes there are always going to be problems there are reforms that are needed the membership issue is one that has been there since the council began how do we how do we enforce soft membership criteria how do we encourage African have the African group has a regional group to stop putting forward countries like Democratic Republic of Congo or Burundi who are violating human rights on a massive scale as candidates but these are things that can be addressed can be worked out this body is only 12 years old and as with all institutions changes are needed but that doesn't mean that we should negate the fact that so much good work has been done at this body Gyan in geneva nikki Haley tried to name and shame Venezuela why at the council during its lifetime has never held a specific singular session on Venezuela I mean it was up to the u.s. to actually call for a special session on Venezuela they haven't done so there there were a member of the council they're not sitting on the margins there were a standing member of it there were many opportunities to actually do some work on Venezuela I I think that I mean I have to accept I mean I I accept what Rosa said that the council is still very much active it has had several successes and it brings to the fore questions that weren't necessarily how would I say tackled previously I mean from questions from LGBTQ to bloggers in Saudi Arabia and elsewhere and and and and the Venezuela actually issue is coming to the fore more so around what you were mentioning earlier the Global Compact and the refugee issues and to be honest another sign of the days is that actually it's other European countries that are starting to actually come to the fore on the issue let's not forget that for instance the Venezuela issue is impacting the latin-american countries that are around it as well as European countries I think of the Netherlands which has a little tiny island off of Venezuela which is receiving a massive influx of refugees and so all these countries there is still a multilateral life to it in fact as independent diplomat we're very active on that front we definitely see the Netherlands as an example Scandinavian countries Canada but also Latin American countries are coming to the fore several African countries are also quite active South Africa is very active at their human rights council it's not a bit sore because the u.s. withdrew that all of a sudden we have an implosion of that system it's actually very much still alive just like the Paris agreement is very much alive and and we've seen that countries do step up and this is good you know I'm going to interrupt you there which I apologize because there are all kinds of other points that I do want to get to as we head towards the end of the program Mohamed in Washington are there other organizations other agreements that the United States may yet still withdraw from well I think the window is open because Trump remains a dogmatically there who is anti-establishment only Alliance on T global he is the non global president of the entire US history basically he wants to push America as far as he could from the rest of the world so it's not just an atlantic ocean there is a deeper ideological and cultural ocean between the United States now and the rest of the world I also like to mention I've served on one of the UN panels of experts and I sensed there was strong alliance between the so called p3 US Britain and France and now I can see this alliance a kind of Breaking Away and I think there is a silver lining in Trump's decision to exit the human right council since Germany France and to the large extent the UK are now trying to restore the values of liberal democracies so I think in the long run the world we look up to Europe more than the United States and I think this is a corrective move on the European side since Trump now is no longer the moral or the leader of this Western paradigm Roza you clearly believe that the council and the UN is safe Helen Clark the former prime minister of New Zealand today saying she thinks there's an outside chance the US may withdraw from the UN so my final question to you is this is the United States heading towards being a rogue state he praises Kim jong-un he puts a coach and horses through the Iran nuclear deal NAFTA TPP the g7 which is looking like it's gonna become the g6 and the g1 at loggerheads I mean how far is the United States prepared to go given what nikki Haley has done today I I don't imagine that the US will withdraw wholly from the UN indeed I don't think it will give up its permanent seat on the Security Council because that seat brings with it power I think that where it comes to issues that Trump doesn't care about human rights the environment anything essentially that isn't about trade and about wealth creation he's likely to to withdraw from institutions or from agreement or simply follow the path of what the US has always done and not sign up to treaties in the first place but I don't believe that the UN is at threat of the US withdrawal I do believe that the UN needs to recalibrate I think that nations need to come together within all of these multilateral institutions and think about how to fill the void and ultimately we're going to have to weather the storm until Trump is no longer president Guillaume in Geneva the last word to you in about the next 30 seconds or so would it be fair to say this US administration is not changing just the United States it's also changing the rest of the world and we don't know yet if it's changing it for the worse or for the better I would say that this decision from the US is forcing everyone to actually change their game so we have countries which are forced to step up as Mohamed has said I fully see it in Geneva and certain countries which are coming to the fore to try to compete and in that sense they actually China and the u.s. sort of looked the same which is an embarrassing situation for the US as traditional allies in Europe but I would say also that for civil society it's also a challenging time they have to actually be the change they want to see and that could also be an opportunity @id we're definitely trying to encourage that movement and working with them I think that this engagement of the at the Human Rights Council should continue and let's see how the new the how the discussions around the reform will play out okay we have to leave it there thank you so much thanks to our guest I'm sure on Rosa Friedman and Mohammed Chacao and thank you to you too for your company
