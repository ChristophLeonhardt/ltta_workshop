1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:02,770
Hiking has so many benefits.

2
00:00:02,770 --> 00:00:08,170
It’s healthy and fun, everyone’s doing
it on Instagram, and it’s the perfect time

3
00:00:08,170 --> 00:00:12,620
to snap some aggressively enthusiastic nature pics for your Tinder profile.

4
00:00:12,620 --> 00:00:17,550
But, before you rush into the woods with a
selfie-stick or hang out in the fields you

5
00:00:17,550 --> 00:00:24,160
need to be aware of these little bastards.

6
00:00:24,170 --> 00:00:26,200
Tickborne diseases are on the rise.

7
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:31,610
Cases of Lyme disease in particular have almost tripled in the last two decades in the US.

8
00:00:31,610 --> 00:00:35,449
Why are there so many more ticks in the country?

9
00:00:35,449 --> 00:00:39,850
Researchers point to climate change as one of the main reasons.

10
00:00:39,850 --> 00:00:43,120
Lyme disease is the most common vector-borne

11
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:44,909
disease in the US.

12
00:00:44,909 --> 00:00:50,530
The bacteria typically lives in mice, birds,
deer, and other animals that ticks like to

13
00:00:50,530 --> 00:00:51,530
feed on.

14
00:00:51,530 --> 00:00:57,240
But it finds its way to humans when infected ticks casually latch on to them in wooded areas.

15
00:00:57,620 --> 00:00:59,210
The bacteria enters the human system via tick bites — though in most cases, the tick must

16
00:00:59,210 --> 00:01:04,220
be attached to the skin for 36 hours or more for the disease to be transmitted.

17
00:01:04,220 --> 00:01:08,910
Lyme disease has a variety of symptoms at various stages including: fever, headache,

18
00:01:08,910 --> 00:01:12,800
fatigue, muscle and joint aches, and the classic bulls-eye rash.

19
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:18,640
Catching the disease early is crucial so antibiotics can be used to treat Lyme.

20
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:22,990
But if it’s left untreated the infection
can spread to other parts of the body like

21
00:01:22,990 --> 00:01:28,960
the heart and the brain and the effects can be much more dangerous.

22
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:34,500
In some cases, though, the disease can mysteriously persist for years even after treatment and

23
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:36,500
researchers haven’t figured out why.

24
00:01:36,500 --> 00:01:40,060
Lyme can be incredibly hard to diagnose.

25
00:01:40,060 --> 00:01:43,640
But all kinds of ticks don’t make you sick.

26
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:48,280
This map shows Lyme disease carrying ticks in the US — the western black legged tick

27
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:54,150
along the Pacific coast, and the black legged tick in the northeast and upper midwest.

28
00:01:54,150 --> 00:01:59,390
You can see the increasing concentration of Lyme cases on the Eastern Seaboard from 2001

29
00:01:59,390 --> 00:02:01,190
through 2015.

30
00:02:01,190 --> 00:02:09,459
And the CDC states that, 95% of confirmed cases were reported from these 14 states.

31
00:02:09,459 --> 00:02:13,450
Researchers believe climate change has a lot to do with this dramatic rise of Lyme disease

32
00:02:13,450 --> 00:02:15,209
in the Northeast.

33
00:02:15,209 --> 00:02:20,849
See ticks don’t survive in cold climates,
so warmer winters are allowing them to venture

34
00:02:20,849 --> 00:02:22,629
further up north.

35
00:02:22,629 --> 00:02:26,719
Higher temperatures are also boosting their reproduction cycle.

36
00:02:26,719 --> 00:02:32,139
Among other explanations, the increase in
deer populations because of hunting protections

37
00:02:32,139 --> 00:02:33,569
is one of them.

38
00:02:33,569 --> 00:02:38,800
And reforestation of former farmlands in the Northeast is also giving ticks more hosts

39
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:40,890
to feed ... and reproduce on?

40
00:02:40,890 --> 00:02:42,680
Damn.

41
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:44,680
Ticks are having sex on deer and

42
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:46,360
Carlos can't even get a date right now.

43
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:47,260
Carlos off-camera: Yes, I can!

44
00:02:47,260 --> 00:02:48,400
Me: Heyyy! Right! Lyme disease!

45
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:53,220
Uhhhh, people are also moving further into the suburbs which puts them closer to tick territory in

46
00:02:53,220 --> 00:02:54,220
wooded areas.

47
00:02:54,230 --> 00:02:58,909
A weird additional factor that's helped
spread Lyme disease is the recent abundance

48
00:02:58,909 --> 00:03:01,389
of acorns in the US.

49
00:03:01,389 --> 00:03:06,709
More acorns means more food for mice, and increased mice populations means more hosts

50
00:03:06,709 --> 00:03:09,190
to carry Lyme-infected ticks.

51
00:03:09,190 --> 00:03:13,489
So what do you do when you're dying for that communing-with-nature-selfie, but you don’t

52
00:03:13,489 --> 00:03:18,400
want to be the dinner host to guests who actually suck the life out of you?

53
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:23,370
Well, before you head outdoors you can treat your clothes and shoes with an insecticide

54
00:03:23,370 --> 00:03:25,140
called permethrin.

55
00:03:25,140 --> 00:03:31,579
Using insect repellents containing DEET or picaridin, is also suggested by the CDC.

56
00:03:31,579 --> 00:03:36,790
Wearing light-colored clothing, long-sleeved shirts, and hats make it easier to spot ticks.

57
00:03:36,790 --> 00:03:41,000
And though it’s not the most fashionable
statement, tucking your pants into your socks

58
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,889
or boots helps too.

59
00:03:42,889 --> 00:03:48,940
When you’re back indoors, showering within two hours, and doing a full body check for ticks is in order.

60
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:53,779
I’m talking scalp, elbows, knees, buttche...you get the picture.

61
00:03:53,779 --> 00:03:57,469
Check your clothes for ticks, then toss those in the dryer.

62
00:03:57,469 --> 00:03:59,340
And if you find a tick attached?

63
00:03:59,340 --> 00:04:04,860
Now is not the time for folklore remedies,
the tick needs to be removed ASAP.

64
00:04:04,860 --> 00:04:06,889
Remove it with fine tipped tweezers.

65
00:04:06,889 --> 00:04:09,829
And watch for Lyme  disease symptoms over the next few weeks.

66
00:04:09,829 --> 00:04:13,180
Lastly, don’t panic if you find out you’re
a total tick magnet.

67
00:04:13,180 --> 00:04:15,420
Carlos off camera: Gross.

68
00:04:15,420 --> 00:04:16,769
[whispers] Yeah...Sor...my bad .. my bad...

69
00:04:16,769 --> 00:04:22,190
The most important thing is being aware of possible bug-a-boo... I mean ticks in your

70
00:04:22,190 --> 00:00:00,000
vicinity and the measures you can take to
protect yourself from Lyme disease.
