THE HOUR WITH "SHEPARD SMITH
REPORTING."
SEE YOU THEN.
>> Dana: VOTING RIGHTS A FLASH
POINT IN THE GEORGIA GOVERNOR'S
RACE.
STACY ABRAMS AGAINST RYAN BRIAN
KEMP WHO IS SECRETARY OF STATE.
HE'S IN CHARGE OF ELECTIONS AND
VOTER REGISTRATION.
ABRAMS AND GROUPS SAY KEMP IS
USES HIS OFFICE TO SUPPRESS THE
VOTE WHICH AFFECTS AFRICAN
AMERICAN AND MINORITY VOTERS.
KEMP DENIES THE ACCUSATIONS.
>> BLACK PEOPLE HAVE AN ISSUE
WITH THE WORLD "AGAIN."
MY FEELING FROM THAT IS BECAUSE
I'M GOING ALL THE WAY TO SIGNAL
IT.
ALL WE HAVE IS NOW.
ALL WE HAVE IS TODAY.
THE WORD AGAIN DOESN'T HURT US
BECAUSE OF THE IDEA OF RACISM
AND SLAVERY.
IT HURTS US BECAUSE WE NEED TO
FOCUS ON WHO WE ARE NOW, TODAY.
>> Dana: THAT'S KANYE WEST IN
HIS VISIT TO THE WHITE HOUSE.
THE MEDIA BLASTING WEST AND
QUESTIONING HIS MENTAL HEALTH.
A SHARP CONTRAST FROM WHAT
TAYLOR SWIFT SAW AFTER SHE BROKE
HER STANCE OF NOT COMMENTING ON
POLITICS.
THE COUNTRY IS DIVIDED INTO THE
TWO CAMPS, THE WOKE AND THE
RESENTFUL.
THEY DECEMBER AGREE VEHEMENTLY
AS MOST ROUTINELY ABOUT THE
CATCH-ALL KNOWN AS POLITICAL
CORRECTNESS.
I'M JOINT BY TYRUS.
I LOVE TALKING TO YOU BECAUSE
YOU CAN HELP ME GET OUT OF MY
NEW YORK BUBBLE.
>> IT'S A BIG BUBBLE.
>> Dana: THAT'S TRUE.
POLITICS IS DOWNSTREAM OF
CULTURE, THIS WEEK CULTURE AND
POLITICS COLLIDED.
WHAT DID YOU THINK ABOUT THAT?
>> TO BE COMPLETELY HONEST, I
DIDN'T CARE.
GOOD FOR HIM HE GOT TO MEET THE
PRESIDENT.
HE WAS STAR STRUCK A LITTLE BIT.
RIGHTFULLY SO.
IF I GOT A CHANCE TO MEET LOU
FERRIGNO FOR THE DAY, I WOULD
PROBABLY TALK THE SAME WAY THAT
KANYE WEST HAS.
HE WAS MY HERO FOR A CHILD.
POLITICAL-WISE, HE WASN'TING
ANYBODY.
HE DIDN'T REPRESENT THE BLACK
COMMUNITY.
HE REPRESENTS KANYE WEST MEETING
THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED
STATES, WHICH IS A GREAT HONOR.
I PROBABLY WOULD HAVE A LITTLE
BETTER PREPARED STATEMENT.
SOMETIMES AS WE KNOW, SOMETIMES
WE TALK AND WE DON'T KNOW HOW TO
END A SENTENCE BECAUSE WE'RE
EXCITED.
LIKE RIGHT NOW.
A SITUATION IDEA.
THIS WOULD BE BETWEEN PEOPLE
HOSPITAL BRACELETS.
>> RAPPER T.I. SAYS I REFUSE TO
ASSOCIATE MYSELF ON SOMEONE SO
VILE.
AT ONE TIME IT WAS A PLEASURE TO
WORK ALONGSIDE YOU.
NOW I'M A SHAMED TO HAVE EVER
BEEN ASSOCIATED WITH YOU.
I THINK YOUR POINT THAT KANYE
WEST WAS THERE FOR HIMSELF.
WHY IS IT THAT OTHERS FEEL LIKE
HE WAS SPEAKING FOR THE AFRICAN
AMERICAN COMMUNITY?
>> ANY TIME YOU TAKE A RISK TO
SUPPORT SOMEBODY, ESPECIALLY --
HE GENERALLY HAS AN AFFECTION
FOR THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED
STATES, WHICH IS FINE.
YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE PEOPLE THAT
ARE GOING TO ATTACK YOU.
IT'S THE WAY WE DO BUSINESS IN
THIS COUNTRY NOW.
KANYE HAS EVERY RIGHT TO SAY AND
DO WHATEVER HE WANTS TO DO.
I DON'T HAVE TO AGREE WITH IT, I
DON'T HAVE TO SUPPORT IT.
HE HAS THE RIGHT.
LIKE I HAVE A RIGHT TO BE
EXCITED ABOUT MEETING LOU
FERRIGNO.
WHERE IT GOES FROM HERE, WE
DON'T KNOW.
MAYBE THAT OPENS THE DOOR TO
SOMETHING, MAYBE IT DOESN'T.
HE HAS EVERY RIGHT AND I SUPPORT
HIM.
IF IT WASN'T A GREAT SPEECH, IT
WASN'T THERE BUT THE MEDIA WAS
THERE EATING IT UP.
>> ELLEN DeGENERES AS A
COMPARISON, WHEN TAYLOR SWIFT
SAID SHE WAS -- SHE ASKED HER
FOLLOWERS TO VOTE, ELLEN SAID
SOMETIMES YOU CAN SHAKE IT OFF
AND SOMETIMES YOU HAVE TO SPEAK
IT UP.
SO MUCH LOVE AND RESPECT, TAYLOR
SWIFT.
IF KANYE WEST HAD SAID SOMETHING
DEROGATORY TOWARDS THE PRESIDENT
OR NOT COMPLIMENTARY OR HE WOULD
HAVE MAYBE HAD A DIFFERENT
RECEPTION.
>> I THINK WE LIVE IN A TIME
WHERE EVERYTHING IS CONVENIENCED
TO HOW I FEEL.
IF YOU DON'T SOMETHING TO I
DON'T LIKE, I'M GOING TO ATTACK
YOU.
IF YOU DO SOMETHING I LIKE, I
CAN PIGGYBACK AND PRAISE YOU FOR
IT.
KANYE SHOWED LOVE FOR THE
PRESIDENT.
TAYLOR SWIFT WAS A LITTLE MORE,
YES, SHE'S SUPPORTING THE
DEMOCRAT, BUT SHE WAS KIND OF
LIKE JUST REGISTER THE VOTE.
SHE WAS MORE LIKE LET'S GET
INVOLVED.
THAT WAS A LITTLE LIGHTER.
