it appears that lawmakers on a local level in Washington DC and also federal lawmakers are doing what they can to block a measure that would essentially increase the wages of restaurant workers from below minimum wage to $15 an hour now this was a ballot initiative that voters in the DC area overwhelmingly approved and because the restaurant industry is in the pockets of these lawmakers they have decided to do what they can to stop it so I'll give you the details now the two GOP representatives mark meadows and Gary Palmer quietly introduced an amendment to the houses government spending bill for 2019 which would essentially block a local ballot measure called initiative 77 from going into effect now that is the ballot initiative that I was speaking about earlier now to give you more details on what that ballot initiative would do and now that it's approved was supposed to do voters in the nation's capitol approved the initiative to require DC businesses to pay restaurant servers and other tipped workers the full minimum wage the new law would slowly rage raise the sub minimum wage for tipped workers from three dollars and 33 cents to $15 an hour by 2025 now the sub minimum wage is something that has been banned in seven states in the US and it essentially says that you know in the states where it's still legal the employers in these restaurants do not have to pay the waiters waitresses bartenders the standard federal minimum wage they can pay them a lot less as long as their tips make up for the difference and so essentially the customers end up subsidizing the salaries or the wages for these workers so the federal sub minimum wage is just 2 dollars and 13 cents that's how much you get if you're a waiter valet a bellhop or a bartender at a minimum and then you get your tips right in in DC the sub minimum wage is three dollars and 33 cents and they want to bring that up to $15 which is the minimum wage in DC through all the way to 2025 so it's really gradual right and there's two important issues here what is the substance of this particular issue and and I'm pointing out that there's seven states who ban the sub minimum wage which means that yes the bartender's and the waiters and waitresses that are make $15 and then they get tips on top and in some states it has an effect of the tips at all they still have very high tipping in those seven states in some states the tipping is actually a little bit lower California and Oregon actually it was surprised to find out or is lower Alaska's one of the highest in the country even though they've also brought up their minimum wage for the waiters right so but the the restaurant owners are saying oh my god we're all gonna go out of business instead of become none of you went out of business in California or Alaska or any of the other states that banned the sub minimum wage just like Washington did California is the equivalent of fifth or sixth largest country in the world if it was its own country so if there was some sort of disaster in California because they're paying waiters $15 or whatever the minimum wages in their local area we know and it didn't have any negative pay it's not a matter of whether we know or not they've already studied it and they in the studies showed that it had no effect they did not these companies did not go bankrupt so why do they care so much well if they pay their workers $2 and you tip them they get the minimum wage and to be fair to the restaurant guys and the law if they don't get to minimum wage that's their tips after tips then they have to at least get their employees to whatever the minimum wages in that jurisdiction so if they do it so they have to put it on top but a lot of them do get past the minimum wage and that's their whole salary and that way hey I just have the diner's pay for the salaries of the waiters waitresses if you have minimum wage then the restaurant owner has to pay the actual salary and then you guys tip the waiters or waitresses and meanwhile the owner is thinking I want that money I wanted that money to go to his way just so I wouldn't have to pay it no customers pay it makes customers pain and like as is the case with so many companies and corporations throughout the country that refused to pay a living wage to their workers and then we the taxpayers end up subsidizing those corporations in the form of government programs to take care of their employees who they refuse to pay a living wage to that's what happened with Walmart that's what's happened with major corporations throughout the country but look that's that's a big issue that's reoccurring we talked about it on the show all the time on a regular basis but the second part of this that enrages me is what's the point of having a ballot initiative where the voters overwhelmingly support the initiative if the law makers are gonna block it what's the point yeah and obviously you don't believe in democracy you just don't it's actually even a little worse than that and it's absolutely right the second point is even more important so I'll tell you why it's worse because if you pass conservative ballot measures they go into effect right away now if you pass progressive ballot measures or ones that are against corruption or one of the ones that are against corporations the lawmakers come in and go sorry nope I'm gonna block all of those I'm only gonna let the conservative ones pass well that's not a democracy and then why are we having these ballot measures I mean they already corrupted Congress you already corrupted the Supreme Court now you're saying I'm gonna corrupt a ballot measure process by only counting the conservative ones we do not have a democratic system in the United States we don't and we haven't for a long time we just don't we don't I mean this is just another example of it doesn't matter if you go out there and vote for these ballot initiatives and overwhelmingly approve it because you'll have lawmakers on a federal level and you'll even have local lawmakers local politicians step in and block it if they're in favor or if they're in the pockets of these corporations and restaurant owners okay so let's give you examples of some local politicians seven seven of the city's 13 council members introduced a bill Tuesday to repeal it no you don't get to do that man they do though this has already happened in Maine so right now we're talking about Washington DC but the exact same thing happened in Maine and I have no doubt that they will succeed in doing this in DC so in Maine they pass about with the same exact proposal and the legislators came and they're like yeah that's like your opinion man so I don't know I get paid by my donors my donors say no so I just threw your democracy in the garbage the GOP doesn't care about you they don't care about you they don't care that you're the little guy they don't care if you're in the middle of the country and you've lost your coal jobs or your manufacturing jobs they've never cared about you they're exploiting you and what you're going through in an effort to win elections but other than that they've never cared about you and this is another example of that they keep making arguments about tax cuts and how fantastic they'll be because they'll create jobs and increase wages wages remain stagnant and they've created jobs sure but some of those jobs are not paying most of those jobs are not paying a living wage a lot of them are temporary jobs a lot of them are part-time jobs so the states that have sub minimum wages the waiters and waitresses are at the poverty line or below at a much greater rate than in the pay in the states that actually have minimum wage for their waiters and waitresses in those states they're they're fine so this actually makes an enormous amount of difference the Republicans say we're gonna give tax cuts for the rich which will eventually increase your wages they pass a law that actually increases your wages and they go no don't increase their wages wait and I thought it was for the workers eventually oh it turns out it's just for the rich they don't care about that and and I'll give you the most egregious example of a ballot measure being voted down by the legislators afterwards it was in South Dakota represent us a wonderful group that fights to get money out of politics when and got a ballot measure passed overwhelmingly in a deeply read state I think it might've been like three-quarters and it because it was very logical it said no more gifts from lobbyists in South Dakota they some of the worst laws they just take unbelievable gifts from lobbyists and it had a lot of other great anti-corruption measures in their past in a landslide right and they came in not only did they say no I'm repealing because I want gifts from lobbyists but then afterwards legislators took pictures with their gifts from the lobbyists to rub it in and he put it on social media like haha you don't have a democracy this is my corrupt and I'll rub your face in it so this destruction of democracy is unacceptable and what you'll see in media is yeah they'll you know talk about Trump's tweets and hey you know that and some people will fight back against Trump others will be on his side etc but these issues that actually affect your lives well he says this she says if they even cover it and if they do cover it it's a lot of well a little bit of this and a little bit of that no it's not no corporate power it has bought off our government and in its keeping your wages low so it can maximize profit and that's why your wages are so goddamn low that's what's happening TV won't tell you that because they're also giant multibillion-dollar corporations too easy
