00:00:07,640 --> 00:00:08,340
BY THE END OF THIS YEAR BY

2
00:00:08,341 --> 00:00:10,142
THE WAY WE HAVE MORE THAN

3
00:00:10,143 --> 00:00:10,909
20,000 PEOPLE WORKING ON

4
00:00:10,910 --> 00:00:12,544
SECURITY AND CONTENT REVIEW

5
00:00:12,545 --> 00:00:13,445
WORKING ACROSS ALL THESE

6
00:00:13,446 --> 00:00:13,979
THINGS.

7
00:00:13,980 --> 00:00:15,180
SO, WHEN CONTENT GETS

8
00:00:15,181 --> 00:00:16,482
FLAGGED TO US, WE HAVE THOSE

9
00:00:16,483 --> 00:00:18,450
PEOPLE LOOK AT IT AND IF IT

10
00:00:18,451 --> 00:00:19,618
VIOLATES OUR POLICIES THEN

11
00:00:19,619 --> 00:00:21,286
WE TAKE IT DOWN.

12
00:00:24,357 --> 00:00:25,891
SOLUTIONS THAN OTHERS.

13
00:00:25,892 --> 00:00:31,930
SO, HATE SPEECH IS ONE OF

14
00:00:31,931 --> 00:00:33,298
THE HARDEST.

15
00:00:33,299 --> 00:00:34,433
DETERMINING IF SOMETHING IS

16
00:00:34,434 --> 00:00:36,402
HATE SPEECH IS

17
00:00:36,403 --> 00:00:40,606
LINGUISTICALLY NUANCED.

18
00:00:40,607 --> 00:00:43,442

19
00:00:43,443 --> 00:00:43,475

20
00:00:43,476 --> 00:00:44,376
>> Dana: MARK ZUCKERBERG

21
00:00:44,377 --> 00:00:47,179
FLAGS HOW SOMETHING IS HATE

22
00:00:47,180 --> 00:00:47,980
SPEECH.

23
00:00:49,716 --> 00:00:51,917
FLAGGED IT AS HATE SPEECH

24
00:00:51,918 --> 00:00:53,352
BEFORE EVENTUALLY RESTORING

25
00:00:53,353 --> 00:00:53,786
IT.

26
00:00:53,787 --> 00:00:55,754
IN A SIMILAR CASE THE GOSPEL

27
00:00:55,755 --> 00:00:57,990

POLITICAL CONTENT AND TAKEN

THE SOCIAL MEDIA GIANT HAS

42
00:01:24,350 --> 00:01:25,751

GROUP SAYING, QUOTE WE MADE

44
00:01:27,153 --> 00:01:28,754
AN ERROR BY DELETING THE

ORIGINAL POST.

46
00:01:29,189 --> 00:01:30,122
AS SOON AS WE IDENTIFIED

WHAT HAPPENED, WE RESTORED

48
00:01:31,458 --> 00:01:33,125
THE POST SINCE IT DOES NOT

49
00:01:33,126 --> 00:01:33,926

00:01:33,927 --> 00:01:35,327
STANDARDS AND HAVE

51
00:01:35,328 --> 00:01:36,995

ENDSLEY.

55
00:01:45,472 --> 00:01:46,104
>> Dana: TELL US ABOUT THE

56
00:01:46,105 --> 00:01:47,739
SONG AND THE MESSAGE YOU

57
00:01:47,740 --> 00:01:50,175
WERE TRYING TO CONVEY AND

58
00:01:50,176 --> 00:01:51,677
HOW THIS WAS TAKEN DOWN BY

59
00:01:53,379 --> 00:01:54,446
AND IT'S ABOUT UNITY AND

60
00:01:54,447 --> 00:01:54,980
IT'S ABOUT HOPE.

61
00:01:54,981 --> 00:01:56,915
WE WERE INCREDIBLY SHOCKED

62
00:01:56,916 --> 00:01:59,151
WHEN FACEBOOK CAME AND TOOK

63
00:01:59,152 --> 00:02:02,454
THIS SONG, THIS MESSAGE THAT

64
00:02:02,455 --> 00:02:03,522
SO NEEDS TO BE HEARD RIGHT

65
00:02:05,558 --> 00:02:06,625
>> Dana: DID THEY GIVE YOU

66
00:02:06,626 --> 00:02:08,193
ANY INDICATION, I KNOW THEY

67
00:02:08,193 --> 00:02:09,627
HAVE SINCE APOLOGIZED.

68
00:02:09,628 --> 00:02:10,795
I SHOULD ASK YOU IF YOU

69
00:02:10,797 --> 00:02:11,730
ACCEPT THEIR APOLOGY.

70
00:02:11,731 --> 00:02:13,599
>> ABSOLUTELY.

71
00:02:16,569 --> 00:02:18,136
THAT WAS ACTUALLY CONSIDERED

72
00:02:18,137 --> 00:02:19,605
POLITICAL SPEECH WHETHER IT

73
00:02:19,606 --> 00:02:20,606
WAS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE

74
00:02:20,607 --> 00:02:22,341
OR A HUMAN THAT MADE THAT

75
00:02:22,342 --> 00:02:22,708
DECISION?

76
00:02:22,709 --> 00:02:23,709
>> YOU KNOW WHAT?

77
00:02:23,710 --> 00:02:25,911
WE ACTUALLY AREN'T FOR SURE.

78
00:02:25,912 --> 00:02:26,845
THE ISSUE HAPPENED WHEN WE

79
00:02:26,846 --> 00:02:28,146
TRIED TO BOOST IT

80
00:02:28,147 --> 00:02:28,547
NATIONALLY.

81
00:02:28,548 --> 00:02:31,350
AND IT WAS POLITICAL

82
00:02:31,351 --> 00:02:31,683
CONTENT.

83
00:02:31,684 --> 00:02:32,551
WHILE WE WERE TRYING TO

84
00:02:32,552 --> 00:02:33,785
FIGURE OUT A SOLUTION FOR

85
00:02:33,786 --> 00:02:34,119
THIS.

86
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:35,521
I WENT AND LOOKED AT THE

87
00:02:35,522 --> 00:02:36,221
FACEBOOK VIDEO.

88
00:02:36,222 --> 00:02:37,523
WE WERE SO EXCITED.

89
00:02:37,524 --> 00:02:39,691
WE HAVE BEEN RECEIVING SOME

90
00:02:39,692 --> 00:02:40,726
POSITIVE REVIEWS AND

91
00:02:40,727 --> 00:02:42,461
FEEDBACK FROM THIS FROM SO

92
00:02:42,462 --> 00:02:43,529
MANY PEOPLE AROUND THE

93
00:02:43,530 --> 00:02:43,862
NATION.

94
00:02:43,863 --> 00:02:45,163
AND SO I WANTED TO SEE WHAT

95
00:02:47,967 --> 00:02:49,434
IT, I NOTICED THAT IT WAS

96
00:02:49,435 --> 00:02:51,703
NOWHERE TO BE FOUND,

97
00:02:51,704 --> 00:02:52,371
ABSOLUTELY ANYWHERE.

98
00:02:52,372 --> 00:02:54,106
EVERYTHING HAD BEEN TAKEN

99
00:02:54,107 --> 00:02:54,506
OFF.

100
00:02:54,507 --> 00:02:55,240
>> Dana: SO THEN YOU

101
00:02:55,241 --> 00:02:55,841
CONTACTED FACEBOOK AND

102
00:02:55,842 --> 00:02:57,943
THAT'S WHEN THEY LOOKED INTO

103
00:02:57,944 --> 00:02:58,210
IT?

104
00:02:58,211 --> 00:02:59,945
>> WE WERE IN THE MIDST OF

105
00:02:59,946 --> 00:03:02,314
TRYING TO FIGURE OUT A

106
00:03:02,315 --> 00:03:04,216
SOLUTION FOR THIS SCENARIO.

107
00:03:04,217 --> 00:03:05,884
SO WE HAD BEEN TRYING TO

108
00:03:05,885 --> 00:03:07,686
FIGURE OUT THE POLITICAL

109
00:03:07,687 --> 00:03:08,921
CONTENT ISSUE AND THEY NEVER

110
00:03:08,922 --> 00:03:10,622
GAVE US A REASONING FOR WHY

111
00:03:10,623 --> 00:03:11,657
THEY TOOK IT OFF.

112
00:03:11,658 --> 00:03:13,358
SO WE STARTED TO KIND OF DO

113
00:03:13,359 --> 00:03:14,226
SOME RESEARCH ON THAT AND

114
00:03:14,227 --> 00:03:16,228
TRY TO FIGURE OUT, BUT WE

115
00:03:16,229 --> 00:03:17,963
NEVER GOT AN ANSWER.

116
00:03:17,964 --> 00:03:18,630
>> Dana: SO DO YOU HAVE

117
00:03:18,631 --> 00:03:19,965
ADVICE FOR ANYBODY ELSE THAT

118
00:03:19,966 --> 00:03:21,833
MAY FIND THEMSELF CAUGHT UP

119
00:03:21,834 --> 00:03:23,402
IN SOMETHING LIKE THIS AND

120
00:03:23,403 --> 00:03:24,469
HOW DO YOU FIGURE OUT A WAY

121
00:03:24,470 --> 00:03:25,637
TO GET FACEBOOK TO RESTORE

122
00:03:25,638 --> 00:03:27,372
IT AND OFFER AN APOLOGY?

123
00:03:30,476 --> 00:03:31,944
BET IS JUST TO TRY YOUR BEST

124
00:03:31,945 --> 00:03:33,312
TO REACH OUT TO ALL OF YOUR

125
00:03:33,313 --> 00:03:34,446
SOURCES THAT ARE AVAILABLE

126
00:03:34,447 --> 00:03:36,848
TO YOU, WHETHER THAT IS NUT

127
00:03:39,652 --> 00:03:42,154
WE WANT THE POSITIVITY AS

128
00:03:42,155 --> 00:03:43,288
MUCH AS POSSIBLE TO BE OUT

129
00:03:43,289 --> 00:03:44,656
IN THE FOREFRONT.

130
00:03:52,532 --> 00:03:53,465
>> Dana: I WANTED TO ASK YOU

131
00:03:59,973 --> 00:04:01,373
IS FACEBOOK STILL THE BEST

132
00:04:01,374 --> 00:04:02,874
WAY FOR YOU TO DO THAT?

133
00:04:02,875 --> 00:04:04,710
>> I THINK IT IS AT THIS

134
00:04:04,711 --> 00:04:05,277
MOMENT IN TIME.

135
00:04:05,278 --> 00:04:06,645
AND I REALLY HOPE THAT IT

136
00:04:06,646 --> 00:04:08,113
CONTINUES TO BE.

137
00:04:08,114 --> 00:04:09,615
>> Dana: AND THEN WHAT DO

138
00:04:09,616 --> 00:04:12,451
YOU HAVE NEXT FOR YOU?

139
00:04:12,452 --> 00:04:13,251
IT'S BACK UP.

140
00:04:13,252 --> 00:04:14,219
WHERE DO YOU GO FROM HERE?

141
00:04:14,220 --> 00:04:15,153
HAVE YOU SOME RECOGNITION

142
00:04:15,154 --> 00:04:15,520
NOW.

143
00:04:15,521 --> 00:04:16,254
IF PEOPLE ARE GOING TO

144
00:04:16,255 --> 00:04:17,389
LISTEN TO YOU, WHAT MORE

145
00:04:17,390 --> 00:04:18,123
WILL THEY FIND OUT?

146
00:04:18,124 --> 00:04:19,124
>> RIGHT.

147
00:04:19,125 --> 00:04:21,326
WELL, THEY ARE JUST GOING TO

148
00:04:21,327 --> 00:04:24,296
FIND A POSITIVE MESSAGE.

149
00:04:24,297 --> 00:04:26,231
WE HAVE SOME AMAZING PEOPLE

150
00:04:26,232 --> 00:04:27,933
IN THIS GROUP AND WE DO SO

151
00:04:27,934 --> 00:04:29,368
MANY OUTREACHES.

152
00:04:29,369 --> 00:04:30,736
NOT ONLY LOCALLY IN

153
00:04:30,737 --> 00:04:32,604
INDIANAPOLIS BUT AROUND THE

154
00:04:32,605 --> 00:04:32,971
NATION.

155
00:04:32,972 --> 00:04:34,373
WE ARE ACTUALLY GOING TO

156
00:04:34,374 --> 00:04:36,308

00:04:41,881 --> 00:04:43,548
WE INVITE PEOPLE TO COME BE

161
00:04:43,549 --> 00:04:45,384
A PART OF WHAT WE ARE DOING.

162
00:04:45,385 --> 00:04:47,319
AND THE POSITIVITY THAT WE

163
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:48,754
ARE SPREADING NOT ONLY

164
00:04:48,755 --> 00:04:50,922
LOCALLY BUT REALLY TRYING TO

165
00:04:50,923 --> 00:04:52,124
PURSUE AROUND THE WORLD.

166
00:04:52,125 --> 00:04:53,492
WE ARE ACTUALLY REALLY

00:04:53,493 --> 00:04:54,726
THANKFUL FOR THIS

168
00:04:54,727 --> 00:04:55,127
OPPORTUNITY.

169
00:04:55,128 --> 00:04:56,128
SOMETHING THAT WAS NEGATIVE

170
00:04:56,129 --> 00:04:58,530
HAS BEEN TURNED INTO A

171
00:04:58,531 --> 00:04:59,598
POSITIVE AND NOW WE ARE
