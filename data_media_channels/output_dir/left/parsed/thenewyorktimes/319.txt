I’ll visualize a run the way
that I want to see it done.
I usually do this off to the side
away from everybody, sort of
in my own quiet space.
When you’re in the
gate, and you’re
standing there
getting ready to drop,
it is the most present,
hyper-focused moment
of my entire life.
I’ve just buckled
my snowboard on.
I can feel the pressure of
my straps on my ankles.
Is it snowing, or is it sunny?
Is there wind on my face?
I reach over to the gate.
I make sure the handles are
adjusted to the right height.
I’m looking at the
top of the start gate,
just waiting for it to move.
Trying to feel what
that adrenaline’s like.
The gate opens.
I can hear it.
It makes an audible click.
I imagine the
exhale of my breath,
because you’re
holding your breath.
And when you pull, you’re
pulling as hard as you can
and trying to generate
as much speed.
And so it’s like this
exhale and react.
I have to move really quickly
over the first two features.
It’s real target shoot.
You really have to barely
pick your feet up and over.
Can hear the wind going
through my goggles,
and I can sort of
feel it on my eyes.
Going probably 40 miles
an hour through there.
I’m jockeying for position,
making sure that my body
position’s really good.
I know people are going to
be trying to crowd my space.
If you’re driving a car, and you
have a five-lane road and six
cars, and you’re all trying
to fight to go the fastest,
you’re going to hit each other.
You’re going to bump
against each other.
You’re going to trade paint.
Rubbing is racing.
Being close to each
other, that’s the chaos.
If you slip up in
the first corner,
your day could be done just
first round, first run.
I always imagine taking a
pretty big deep breath at about
halfway through the course.
A lot of times you
can hear an edge
running through the
snow or somebody coming
up short on a jump.
My heart rate’s going
through my roof.
If there’s a competitor
in front of me,
I’m staying right on their
tail and breaking off
to the left just
at the last second
before I go through
the last two rollers
and across the finish line.
Even when I’m just
visualizing it
right now, when I
cross the finish line,
it’s this huge relief.
It’s like, O.K., I
made it down safe.
I’m going on to the next round.
Let’s do this again.
I’m not out there knitting
sweaters, you know?
I’m racing boardercross
because it makes me feel alive
and because I love it.
It’s gnarly.
Goddamn, it’s
probably — yeah, it’s
the best drug you’re
going to be able to do.
So, it’s good.
