it's not just any door its historic and opens to history of the civil rights movement in America the door was on the home of Rosa Parks a black woman who famously refused to give up her seat and a bus to a white man which led to the Montgomery bus boycott one of the most instrumental moments in black struggle for equality in America parks is considered a historic figure and recently the house she lived in during that period was saved from being demolished and put back together as a piece of historic art most recently touring Germany the tiny one-room house is now disassembled and is going up for auction organizers hope it will be showcased to the public but rather end up in a place where the public will have access to it where though a simple modest house it its what it signifies that may hopefully inspire many down the road but it's not only Rosa Parks home that will be auctioned there are dozens of other important artifacts from african-american history that will also go up for auction there are personal artifacts by Art Tatum a black musician who in the 1950s was considered the finest jazz piano player who ever lived there is also the original manuscript of the autobiography of malcolm x the muslim minister and human rights activists in red ink are his handwritten notes for the publisher there are original handwritten score sheets from the temptations the black vocal group that revolutionized soul music and then there is this the first-ever contract for the Jackson 5 that piece of paper gave birth to the careers of the Jackson 5 and most notably Michael Jackson but it's a home of Rosa Parks it will be the highlight of it all in what organizers are calling one of the most powerful actions of African American historical artifacts ever assembled Gabriel Sandow al Jazeera New York
