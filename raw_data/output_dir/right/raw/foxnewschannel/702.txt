WE WILL STOP HIM.

163

A WEEK LATER HE TEXTED HIS LOVER

164

WAS THE RIGHT THING TO DO.

171
00:06:46,327 --> 00:06:48,795
WHEN MUELLER WAS APPOINTED.

172
00:06:48,796 --> 00:06:50,497
I SAID THERE WAS NO BASIS.

173
00:06:56,971 --> 00:07:00,440
I KNEW IT WAS WRONG AND I STOOD

174
00:07:00,441 --> 00:07:02,943

00:07:44,419 --> 00:07:48,823
I CARE MORE ABOUT THE OTHER

192
00:07:55,597 --> 00:07:57,598
IT’S GOING TO INCREASE THE TIMES

193
00:07:57,599 --> 00:07:58,900
OF CAREER OPPORTUNITIES THAT

194
00:07:58,901 --> 00:08:00,668
KEEP OUR BRIGHTEST AND BEST HERE

195
00:08:00,669 --> 00:08:01,302
IN FLORIDA.

196
00:08:01,303 --> 00:08:03,438
AND MAKE US A MAGNET FOR TALENT

197
00:08:03,439 --> 00:08:04,572
FROM AROUND THE WORLD.

198
00:08:04,573 --> 00:08:06,574
THAT’S THE JOB OF THE NEXT

199
00:08:06,575 --> 00:08:07,876
GOVERNOR OF THE GREAT STATE TO

200
00:08:07,877 --> 00:08:11,479
PUT THE THIRD LARGEST STATE IN

201
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:14,416
A POSITION TO HELP MAKE AMERICA

202
00:08:14,417 --> 00:08:16,718
GREAT AGAIN BY OUR STRENGTH IN

203
00:08:24,927 --> 00:08:30,732
REPAIRED  -- PREPARED TO ENDORSE

204
00:08:30,733 --> 00:08:33,235
PRESIDENT TRUMP IN 2020?

205
00:08:33,236 --> 00:08:39,574
>> MOST ASSUREDLY AND I LOOK

206
00:08:39,575 --> 00:08:45,314
FORWARD TO CAMPAIGNING WITH HIM.

207
00:08:45,315 --> 00:08:50,119
>> IN 2016 YOU COULD NOT FIND

208
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:54,123
HIM IF YOU HAD A SEARCH WARRANT.

209
00:08:54,124 --> 00:08:56,358
>> I SUPPORT OUR PRESIDENT’S

210
00:08:56,359 --> 00:08:57,793
AGENDA FOR OUR COUNTRY AND ALL

211
00:08:57,794 --> 00:08:59,495
OF US PAID LESS IN TAXES THIS

212
00:08:59,496 --> 00:09:00,729
YEAR BECAUSE OF TRUMP’S TAX

213
00:09:04,334 --> 00:09:10,439
TO OUR SO-CALLED TRADING

214
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:14,410
PARTNERS TO DEFEND FLORIDA

215
00:09:14,411 --> 00:09:16,646
FARMERS AND HE WENT TO NORTH

216
00:09:16,647 --> 00:09:17,847
KOREA TO DENUCLEARIZE THE

217
00:09:17,848 --> 00:09:19,682
PENINSULA AND THE FACT HE IS

218
00:09:19,683 --> 00:09:20,816
GETTING ANOTHER SUPREME COURT

219
00:09:20,817 --> 00:09:22,385
AND TOGETHER WE GET TO WATCH

220
00:09:22,386 --> 00:09:29,425
AMERICA GET WERT BY THE DAY

221
00:09:29,426 --> 00:09:30,193
WHILE HILLARY CLINTON EXPLAINS

222
00:09:30,194 --> 00:09:31,761
THE TITLE OF HER BOOK, WHAT

223
00:09:31,762 --> 00:09:32,128
HAPPENED.

224
00:09:32,129 --> 00:09:33,896
SHE LOST, THAT’S WHAT HAPPENED.

225
00:09:33,897 --> 00:09:35,298
>> CONGRESSMAN DESANTIS, YOU

226
00:09:35,299 --> 00:09:37,333
HAVE THE ENDORSEMENT OF

227
00:09:37,334 --> 00:09:38,134
PRESIDENT TRUMP.

228
00:09:38,135 --> 00:09:40,837
BUT ACCORDING TO TWO RECENT

229
00:09:40,838 --> 00:09:42,872
POLLS, YOUR OPPONENT HAS THE

230
00:09:42,873 --> 00:09:44,174
SUPPORT OF TWICE AS MANY FLORIDA

231
00:09:44,175 --> 00:09:46,109
REPUBLICANS AS YOU DO.

232
00:09:46,110 --> 00:09:49,446
YOU MADE A LOT OF APPEARANCES ON

233
00:09:49,447 --> 00:09:50,413
YOUR NETWORK.

234
00:09:50,414 --> 00:09:51,548
LEADING COMMISSIONER PUTNAM TO

235
00:09:51,549 --> 00:09:53,516
SAY YOU ARE RUNNING THIS RACE

236
00:10:01,359 --> 00:10:04,895
HOW DO YOU RESPOND TO WHAT HE IS

237
00:10:04,896 --> 00:10:05,262
CHARGING?

238
00:10:05,263 --> 00:10:06,763
>> HE SAID I HAVE NOT SPENT

239
00:10:06,764 --> 00:10:08,298
ENOUGH TIME IN FLORIDA.

240
00:10:08,299 --> 00:10:10,300
I WAS BORN AND RAISEED IN

241
00:10:10,301 --> 00:10:10,634
FLORIDA.

242
00:10:14,839 --> 00:10:15,539
REPRESENTING FLORIDA.

243
00:10:15,540 --> 00:10:19,109
I WENT TO IT HIGH SCHOOL HERE.

244
00:10:19,110 --> 00:10:21,411
WORKED $6 AN HOUR TO MAKE

245
00:10:21,412 --> 00:10:22,379
SOMETHING OF MYSELF.

246
00:10:22,380 --> 00:10:23,680
I DIDN’T HAVE ANYTHING HANDED TO

247
00:10:23,681 --> 00:10:23,947
ME.

248
00:10:23,948 --> 00:10:25,415
THERE WERE TIMES I WISH I COULD

249
00:10:25,416 --> 00:10:27,651
HAVE SPENT MORE TIME IN FLORIDA.

250
00:10:27,652 --> 00:10:29,653
THE CHRISTMAS OF 2006 I WAS NOT

251
00:10:29,654 --> 00:10:32,523
HOME WITH MY FAMILY.

252
00:10:32,524 --> 00:10:34,758
I WAS IN GUANTANAMO BAY CUBA.

253
00:10:38,730 --> 00:10:42,166
WAS IN IRAQ WORKING FOR THE

254
00:10:42,167 --> 00:10:42,766
COMMANDING OFFICER.

255
00:10:42,767 --> 00:10:44,902
I WOULD HAVE LOVED TO HAVE BEEN

256
00:10:44,903 --> 00:10:46,604
IN FLORIDA WITH MY FAMILY.

257
00:10:46,605 --> 00:10:47,638
SOMETIMES DUTY CALLS AND YOU

258
00:10:47,639 --> 00:10:49,206
HAVE TO STEP UP AND DO WHAT IS

259
00:10:49,207 --> 00:10:52,109
RIGHT.

260
00:10:52,110 --> 00:10:55,146
SOME OF THE THINGS I HAVE BEEN

261
00:10:55,147 --> 00:10:58,683
DOING TO SUPPORT OUR PRESIDENT

262
00:10:58,684 --> 00:11:00,952
AGENDA, THIS MORNING I WAS

263
00:11:00,953 --> 00:11:02,753
GRILLING ROB ROSENSTEIN WHY

264
00:11:02,754 --> 00:11:04,355
THERE WAS ANTI-TRUMP BIAS AND

265
00:11:04,356 --> 00:11:06,657
WHY THEY ARE NOT COMING CLEAN

266
00:11:06,658 --> 00:11:08,626
WITH US AND WHY THEY WERE

267
00:11:08,627 --> 00:11:10,895
MONITORING THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN.

268
00:11:10,896 --> 00:11:12,196
THAT’S WHAT I WAS PAID TO DO.

269
00:11:12,197 --> 00:11:13,765
AT THE END OF THE DAY BOTH

270
00:11:13,766 --> 00:11:16,134
THINGS ARE VERY, VERY IMPORTANT.

271
00:11:16,135 --> 00:11:17,835
I WILL KEEP DOING BOTH.

272
00:11:17,836 --> 00:11:19,737
>> 42% OF YOUR CONTRIBUTIONS

273
00:11:22,408 --> 00:11:24,442
UNDERSTAND, THERE ARE A LOT OF

274
00:11:24,443 --> 00:11:26,311
PEOPLE WHO SPEND HALF THE YEAR

275
00:11:26,312 --> 00:11:26,744
IN FLORIDA.

276
00:11:26,745 --> 00:11:28,980
A LOT OF THESE PEOPLE THEY

277
00:11:28,981 --> 00:11:31,249
TALKED ABOUT ARE BIG SUPPORTERS

278
00:11:31,250 --> 00:11:32,517
OF PRESIDENT TRUMP.

279
00:11:32,518 --> 00:11:33,852
DONALD TRUMP HIMSELF SPENDS A

280
00:11:33,853 --> 00:11:35,186
LOT OF TIME IN FLORIDA.

281
00:11:35,187 --> 00:11:36,888
HE IS NOT A FLORIDA RESIDENT.

282
00:11:36,889 --> 00:11:38,924
WHAT WILL HAPPEN BECAUSE OF THE

283
00:11:38,925 --> 00:11:42,194
TAX CUTS WE PASSED GETTING RID

284
00:11:42,195 --> 00:11:44,162
OF THE SUBSIDY FOR HIGH TAX

285
00:11:44,163 --> 00:11:46,765
STATES, PEOPLE WILL SAY WHY DO I

286
00:11:46,766 --> 00:11:48,900
HAVE A BUSINESS IN ILLINOIS?

287
00:11:48,901 --> 00:11:50,869
I CAN BRING IT TO FLORIDA.

288
00:11:50,870 --> 00:11:52,471
WE HAVE A GREAT OPPORTUNITY TO

289
00:11:52,472 --> 00:11:53,972
DO BETTER IN FINANCE, TECHNOLOGY

290
00:11:53,973 --> 00:11:55,974
AND MANUFACTURING IF WE HAVE THE

291
00:11:59,279 --> 00:11:59,678
RICK SCOTT.

292
00:11:59,679 --> 00:12:02,614
>> [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE].

293
00:12:02,615 --> 00:12:05,384
>> MR. PUTNAM, IN RECENT WEEKS

294
00:12:05,385 --> 00:12:10,189
WE HAVE SEEN A REAL RISE IN

295
00:12:10,190 --> 00:12:12,358
INSTABILITY AROUND THE ISSUE OF

296
00:12:12,359 --> 00:12:13,325
BORDER POLICY.

297
00:12:13,326 --> 00:12:16,996
LAST WEEK PAM BONDI WAS HARASSED

298
00:12:16,997 --> 00:12:21,867
IN A MOVIE THEATRE HERE.

299
00:12:21,868 --> 00:12:24,870
MANY DEMOCRATS AND EVEN A FEW

300
00:12:24,871 --> 00:12:26,172
REPUBLICANS SAY THAT PRESIDENT

301
00:12:26,173 --> 00:12:29,141
TRUMP SET THE TONE HERE AT THE

302
00:12:29,142 --> 00:12:29,508
BEGINNING.

303
00:12:29,509 --> 00:12:31,277
DURING THE CAMPAIGN, YOU WERE

304
00:12:31,278 --> 00:12:35,648
ONE OF THOSE CRITICAL

305
00:12:35,649 --> 00:12:37,350
REPUBLICANS.

306
00:12:37,351 --> 00:12:38,651
CONGRESSMAN DESANTIS MENTIONED

307
00:12:38,652 --> 00:12:40,720
IT THERE.

308
00:12:40,721 --> 00:12:44,457
YOU CALLED TRUMP VILE AND

309
00:12:44,458 --> 00:12:49,228
OBSCENE AND DISHONORABLE.

310
00:12:49,229 --> 00:12:51,998
DOES HE DESERVE SOME OF THE

311
00:12:51,999 --> 00:12:52,298
BLAME?

312
00:12:52,299 --> 00:12:53,466
>> I DIDN’T CALL THE PRESIDENT

313
00:12:53,467 --> 00:12:54,167
THOSE THINGS.

314
00:12:54,168 --> 00:12:56,169
I SUPPORT THE PRESIDENT.

315
00:13:01,842 --> 00:13:04,377
TRYING TO BLAME HIM FOR.

316
00:13:04,378 --> 00:13:07,247
LOOK AT WHAT MAXINE WATERS HAS

317
00:13:07,248 --> 00:13:07,547
SAID.

318
00:13:07,548 --> 00:13:09,382
YOUR QUESTION ABOUT OUT OF STATE

319
00:13:09,383 --> 00:13:11,184
INFLUENCE IN FLORIDA.

320
00:13:11,185 --> 00:13:13,787
THE REAL DANGER IS NOTING WHAT

321
00:13:13,788 --> 00:13:17,557
IS GOING -- THIS STAGE, IT’S THE

322
00:13:17,558 --> 00:13:20,493
FACT THAT TWO MEN ARE TRYING TO

323
00:13:20,494 --> 00:13:24,664
HIGH JACK FLORIDA POLITICS.

324
00:13:24,665 --> 00:13:26,733
IT’S NOT BECAUSE THEY CARE ABOUT

325
00:13:26,734 --> 00:13:28,468
HOW LONG HE SPEND IN TRAFFIC OR

326
00:13:28,469 --> 00:13:30,470
CARE ABOUT THE QUALITY OF OUR

327
00:13:30,471 --> 00:13:32,539
SCHOOLS IN NORTHWEST FLORIDA.

328
00:13:32,540 --> 00:13:35,108
IT’S NOT BECAUSE THEY CARE ABOUT

329
00:13:35,109 --> 00:13:36,410
THE QUALITY OF THE WATER IN THE

330
00:13:36,411 --> 00:13:36,710
LAKE.

331
00:13:36,711 --> 00:13:38,245
IT’S BECAUSE THEY CARE ABOUT ONE

332
00:13:38,246 --> 00:13:38,812
THING ONLY.

333
00:13:38,813 --> 00:13:41,682
THAT IS DEFEATING OUR PRESIDENT,

334
00:13:41,683 --> 00:13:42,816
TAKING BACK THE WHITE HOUSE AND

335
00:13:46,621 --> 00:13:48,889
WE CAN’T LET THE LEFT HIJACK

336
00:13:48,890 --> 00:13:52,326
FLORIDA’S POLITICS, FLORIDA’S

337
00:13:52,327 --> 00:13:55,562
GOVERNOR MANSION OR FLORIDA’S

338
00:13:55,563 --> 00:13:57,798
CABINET OR LEGISLATURE.

339
00:13:57,799 --> 00:13:59,466
>> LET ME RESPOND.

340
00:13:59,467 --> 00:14:00,568
THIS IS PERSONAL.

341
00:14:04,139 --> 00:14:07,208
I WAS THROWING BALLS TO STEVE

342
00:14:07,209 --> 00:14:09,944
SCALISE WHO WAS PLAYING 2ND BASE

343
00:14:09,945 --> 00:14:12,713
AND JEFF AND I DECIDED TO BEAT

344
00:14:12,714 --> 00:14:14,115
D.C. TRAFFIC DOES LEFT 5 MINUTES

345
00:14:14,116 --> 00:14:14,949
BEFORE STEVE WAS SHOT.

346
00:14:14,950 --> 00:14:16,517
WE WERE GETTING INTO A CAR.

347
00:14:16,518 --> 00:14:18,486
A MAN WHOM WE DIDN’T KNOW CAME

348
00:14:18,487 --> 00:14:19,954
UP TO US AND SAID ARE THOSE

349
00:14:19,955 --> 00:14:21,589
REPUBLICANS ON THE FIELD?

350
00:14:21,590 --> 00:14:22,456
WE WERE LIKE YES.

351
00:14:22,457 --> 00:14:23,424
THE REPUBLICAN TEAM.

352
00:14:23,425 --> 00:14:27,295
WE PULL AWAY.

353
00:14:27,296 --> 00:14:28,729
TWO MINUTES LATER HE GRABS

354
00:14:28,730 --> 00:14:30,565
A RIFLE.

355
00:14:30,566 --> 00:14:32,266
THANK GOD I WAS NOT THERE.

356
00:14:32,267 --> 00:14:33,768
I WOULD HAVE BEEN IN THE LINE.

357
00:14:33,769 --> 00:14:34,969
HE SHOT STEVE.

358
00:14:34,970 --> 00:14:38,139
HE WOULD HAVE SHOT 10 OR 15

359
00:14:38,140 --> 00:14:38,539
REPUBLICANS.

360
00:14:38,540 --> 00:14:41,109
HE WAS MOTIVATED BY ANTI-TRUMP

361
00:14:41,110 --> 00:14:41,409
RAGE.

362
00:14:41,410 --> 00:14:44,245
HE WAS A RAVING LUNATIC.

363
00:14:44,246 --> 00:14:45,947
BUT IF THERE WERE A FOX NEWS

364
00:14:45,948 --> 00:14:47,649
VIEWING TRUMP SUPPORTER WHO DID

365
00:14:47,650 --> 00:14:48,783
THAT ARE IF DEMOCRATS THE MEDIA

366
00:14:48,784 --> 00:14:50,652
WOULD VIEW IT AS THE BIGGEST

367
00:14:50,653 --> 00:14:51,753
THING IN WORLD HISTORY.

368
00:14:51,754 --> 00:14:54,322
THERE THEY SWEPT IT UNDER THE

369
00:14:54,323 --> 00:14:54,589
RUG.

370
00:14:54,590 --> 00:14:55,624
PEOPLE DIDN’T TALK ABOUT IT

371
00:14:55,625 --> 00:14:57,726
AFTER A WEEK.

372
00:14:57,727 --> 00:15:00,862
THIS INSTABILITY, I DON’T BLAME

373
00:15:00,863 --> 00:15:01,296
DONALD TRUMP.

374
00:15:01,297 --> 00:15:06,868
I BLAME THAT GUY AND ALL OF HIS

375
00:15:13,609 --> 00:15:17,512
LEADING THE FIGHT TO CENSURE

376
00:15:17,513 --> 00:15:19,314
MAXINE WATERS FOR HER CONDUCT.

377
00:15:19,315 --> 00:15:21,917
>> THERE ARE THOSE WHO SAY IT’S

378
00:15:21,918 --> 00:15:23,886
FINE TO POINT A FINGER AT MAXINE

379
00:15:23,887 --> 00:15:26,321
WATERS AND SAY THAT’S UNCIVIL

380
00:15:26,322 --> 00:15:26,688
BEHAVIOR.

381
00:15:26,689 --> 00:15:28,357
A LOT OF PEOPLE WOULD AGREE WITH

382
00:15:28,358 --> 00:15:28,624
YOU.

383
00:15:28,625 --> 00:15:29,391
THE PRESIDENT IS THE PRESIDENT

384
00:15:29,392 --> 00:15:30,626
OF THE UNITED STATES.

385
00:15:30,627 --> 00:15:35,130
HE HAS A ROLE TO PLAY IN

386
00:15:35,131 --> 00:15:36,932
RESTORING CIVILITY.

387
00:15:36,933 --> 00:15:37,333
DOES HE?

388
00:15:39,336 --> 00:15:42,404
IN WASHINGTON AND THE COUNTRY

389
00:15:42,405 --> 00:15:44,240
TRUMP HAS ALMOST THE ENTIRE

390
00:15:44,241 --> 00:15:45,441
MEDIA AGAINST HIM.

391
00:15:45,442 --> 00:15:47,243
FAKE NEWS AGAINST HIM DAY AFTER

392
00:15:47,244 --> 00:15:48,544
DAY AND THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY AND

393
00:15:48,545 --> 00:15:51,647
THE LOBBYISTS AFTER HIM AND HE

394
00:15:51,648 --> 00:15:54,216
HAS GOT SOME REPUBLICANS WHO

395
00:15:54,217 --> 00:15:55,751
HAVE COME AFTER HIM.

396
00:16:02,526 --> 00:16:06,195
THE LAST THING I WANT TO DO IS

397
00:16:06,196 --> 00:16:07,697
LOB HAND GRENADES AT THE

398
00:16:09,133 --> 00:16:10,133
UNDERSTAND WHAT HE IS UP AGAIN

399
00:16:10,134 --> 00:16:12,702
AND HE IS FACING OPPOSITION

400
00:16:12,703 --> 00:16:15,772
UNLIKE ANY OTHER PRESIDENT WE

401
00:16:15,773 --> 00:16:16,706
HAVE SEEN.

402
00:16:16,707 --> 00:16:17,941
>> [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE].

403
00:16:17,942 --> 00:16:22,378
>> DO YOU WANT TO RESPOND?

404
00:16:22,379 --> 00:16:24,447
>> WE HAVE LOST A NUMBER OF LAW

405
00:16:24,448 --> 00:16:25,381
ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS IN THE

406
00:16:25,382 --> 00:16:27,450
STATE OF FLORIDA THIS YEAR.

407
00:16:27,451 --> 00:16:30,186
I THINK THAT IT’S IMPORTANT THAT

408
00:16:30,187 --> 00:16:32,622
WE REMEMBER THE THINGS THAT WERE

409
00:16:32,623 --> 00:16:35,625
SAID BY THE LAST PRESIDENT THAT

410
00:16:39,931 --> 00:16:42,132
THAT QUESTIONED THEIR

411
00:16:42,133 --> 00:16:42,699
COMMITMENT.

412
00:16:42,700 --> 00:16:45,969
THEY STAND ON THAT THIN BLUE

413
00:16:45,970 --> 00:16:48,238
LINE BETWEEN ORDER AND CHAOS.

414
00:16:48,239 --> 00:16:50,674
I BELIEVE THAT ANYONE WHO WANTS

415
00:16:50,675 --> 00:16:52,109
TO POINT THE FINGER AT PRESIDENT

416
00:16:52,110 --> 00:16:53,810
TRUMP NEEDS TO LOOK AT THE

417
00:16:56,180 --> 00:16:57,614
ANTI-LAW ENFORCEMENT AND

418
00:16:57,615 --> 00:16:59,917
ANTI-SHERIFF AND ANTI-COP.

419
00:16:59,918 --> 00:17:01,585
AND MAKE ABSOLUTELY CERTAIN THAT

420
00:17:01,586 --> 00:17:03,187
EVERYONE IN FLORIDA KNOWS THE

421
00:17:06,458 --> 00:17:08,292
THERE METHOD OF INCIVILITY DID

422
00:17:08,292 --> 00:17:09,992
NOT BEGIN WITH PRESIDENT TRUMP.

423
00:17:09,993 --> 00:17:12,862
IT’S ONLY REPORTED BY THE LEFT

424
00:17:12,864 --> 00:00:00,000
WING MEDIA BECAUSE THEY WANT TO
