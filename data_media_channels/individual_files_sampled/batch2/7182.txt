Donald Trump likes to tout the fact or in his idea the fact that he has increased jobs in the United States he's a big job creator and it's because of his policies on there cutting taxes or do regulating things but in reality if you look at the numbers and this is according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics and also by Bloomberg 2017 was the year that job creation slowed down considerably in fact Trump's much much hyped job boom was actually the worst year of job creation since 2011 and we have the numbers to prove it to you but James actually gonna maybe defend Trump a little bit yeah so we'll get to that in a second now according to Bloomberg u.s. payroll gains slowed by more than forecast in December wage growth picked up slightly and the unemployment rate held at the lowest levels since 2000 ad into signs of a full employment economy job gains while less than forecast bring the 2017 total to 2.06 million jobs that's below 2016 okay now if you go to the Bureau of Labor Statistics the number of jobs created last year were actually the fewest in a year since 2011 and here is a graph to kind of show you how things played out throughout the year so 2011 being the first year shown on that graph and you can see the dip from 2014 to now even Fox News had to admit that the jobs created under Trump's presidency were lackluster or the number were lackluster let's take a look at their tweet shows you year by year how many jobs were created and if you can see 2017 was the lowest number since 2011 ok now with that said you have to keep in mind that the unemployment rate is extremely low so Jim this is your opportunity to jump in yeah so couple of things here he he says that he's number one with jobs it's a tweet after tweet he's something about how God's gonna be amazed at how many jobs he creates or something right oh well okay if you're that over the top then I guess you've got a higher hurdle to clear and he didn't clear that hurdle because Clinton and Obama etc were better on average but to be fair and this is a funny kind of backhanded compliment to him but Obama created so many jobs that there aren't that many jobs left to create so when so for example we lost about 8.7 million jobs during the recession under Bush so Obama and again this is now I'm just trying to be fair so you lose all those jobs that Obama adds all of them back so you give him credit for that give him tremendous credit for that but he had to add him back right because there was a recession so then you put a grain of salt on how many jobs Obama added back but he did the right thing Singh got him back and he's a part of that puzzle now the unemployment rate is low enough that it's harder to bring it down lower so yes so Trump has added jobs he hasn't been able to add as many jobs as Obama but he didn't start in as big a hole as Obama did he started in pretty good shape now so if you were being fair if Trump was being fair he'd say look Obama did an amazing job of creating all these jobs so I didn't have as many jobs to be able to create but hey I did a pretty good job and that would be fair I actually really don't like the way that the data is presented in reference to jobs because what is what does it mean we created two point zero six million jobs in 2017 okay but what what's the quality of those jobs what are those jobs pay are those full-time jobs that offer benefits like if you are working a couple hours a week making minimum wage you're considered employed that's considered a job but that is not a job that will help you make ends meet and you know provide a roof over your head or food on the table for your family so I wish that the conversation focused more on the quality of the jobs that are created as opposed to oh yeah there's millions of jobs created under my presidency I don't care that's honestly that number is really irrelevant to me when we talk about you know the wages and how stagnant they've been and yes wages have gone up slightly but the main word there is slightly it has not kept up with inflation and that's the big issue well I think that he's talking about creating jobs for more McDonald's workers who make his food right you know not a whole lot more McDonald's workers though you know you I come here to make my commentary on the sound of comedian I'm not an expert I'm not a political pundit that's what these guys are here for so my only what I want to say about this is that as Obama was a politician and as corrupt and as messed up as politicians are he seems to be the bar for a Donald Trump because everything that he does is in comparison to what Obama did and Obama really made such an impression where I see those tweets with the letter O it's like it's an obsession with Obama and undoing everything Obama did for his base who hate Obama because Obama is a black man and he was in the White House but it's just it stuck don't you think that aren't you tired of it like I'm so tough can you stop tweeting about Obama and everything that you do in comparison to what Obama did and just set your own bar and your own standard because it's getting kind of old even the people who love Donald Trump are getting tired of hearing about can you just stop tweeting period well that would be that's that's Michael Schur earlier in the show is making a very similar point and I remember I was I happen to happen to be the one White House Correspondents Dinner that I was at that when Obama made fun of Donald Trump's any and man Trump was so mad at that right and and for him like and you know the racial components too like who is this guy to make fun of me absolutely and I got so under his very thin skin it wasn't hard to get under that thin skin and it you're right he's obsessed with it now to the to the substance of the of the jobs issue ana is overwhelmingly right here so and by the way again fair to criticize both Trump and Obama any president yes so it's not that the jobs created are irrelevant it's better to have jobs and not to have jobs better to have lower unemployment so god bless on that but the quality jobs is enormous ly important and the ones that were created under Obama were also not very good okay the ones created under Trump they're all these are all really low-wage jobs that's why America and it's not because of our productivity American workers have done a fantastic job productivity is sky-high and it has been throughout okay but in 1978 wages flatlined if you look at the chart it's like this for productivity goes just like that so you're doing a wonderful job you're working your ass off and wages are going up with it until 1978 and then boom it flatlines this system is rigged they rigged it by keeping them in a wage low by making sure corporations got more tax cuts and what a Trump dude he just gave them even more tax cuts and he said that it would create record amount of jobs but it hasn't and he certainly hasn't created very good jobs so that's the most important part of this fallacy right it's a mass hysteria this came from a little steel town in Pennsylvania where I was performing last week and those all those those steel factories are closed and those people really think that he's gonna bring that back and oh you we were sitting talking to these people and they thought they really think they really believed in him that he's gonna create these jobs in their town is gonna be booming again and that's the sad thing about it is that yeah you know yeah and when they come to find out that he didn't they're gonna be pretty pissed yeah if you become a member of the Young Turks you'll be saying you know I'm like a smart person so do it right now ey tea network.com slash join get the whole Yonkers show every day
