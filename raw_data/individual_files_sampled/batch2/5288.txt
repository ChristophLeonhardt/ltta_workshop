why should the average person who is home right now having a cup of coffee on their way to work why do they care about halt mana Fortin Rick Gates these are just two guys who seem to embezzle money for themselves well I would say to pay attention to today as Ken pointed out they were just yesterday starting to get into these connections to Ukraine that could be really I guess enlightening to show just how deeply tied Paul Manafort was to pro-kremlin interests in Ukraine we already know about the sixty million dollar payment but there is a sense that there's a lot more here and we could get a lot more clarity on how tied he is to the Ukraine and I would also note that even though this has nothing to do with the election and there is nothing ruling out that there wouldn't be further indictments that could come from Muller against manna fort or gates I have no reporting to indicate that there are any more indictments coming but I would just say leave open the possibility in your mind that there could still also be more to come manna Fortin gates as molars investigation continues or as he sort of unrolls further indictments or his further report so I would keep an eye on these two guys so you're saying that there's a chance all right mid when we know what manna forts attorneys are gonna do they're going to say Gates is the real criminal here Madoff or was a business guy with complicated taxes and he made a couple of mistakes is that gonna fly of course they're gonna say that it's their job to say that their job is to defend man afford at pretty much all cost here however I just don't know how much it's going to fly I think from what I've read about gates testimony and I've been following this trial from the very beginning he's very credible he's very credible I hold on I'm very credible this guy lied to investigators even while negotiating his plea deals right I actually think that that makes his testimony about madmen afford directing him to lie to the IRS directing him to change income and call it loans I think that makes him credible this is a guy who was willing to lie to the IRS this is a guy who was willing to sort of buck the system and and and create you know a situation where man afford makes money now what I think is interesting is he said on the stand that he never benefited simile from the things that metaphor directed him to do so I think that makes an Achon well not in that's not necessarily he also said on the stand that he embezzled hundreds of thousands of dollars from manna Ford himself in other words this is not a guy who's upright this is not a guy you know who is going to follow the line and work within the rules of IRS and work within the rules of banking laws okay then I ask the same question to you can in terms of dates his credibility here he's a known liar - sure Stephanie but that's very common in these kinds of cases when you have a cooperator who is part of a criminal conspiracy they tend not to come from Little Sisters of the Poor they're criminals and the point is that the jury is not gonna like this guy he's a very unappealing unsavory character but the prosecution wants the jury to believe this guy and that's why they confronted them up front with all these bad acts because they don't want there to be any surprises on cross-examination if the defense can land a punch it would be some unexpected negative thing and gates his background that the prosecution hasn't already vetted with the jury but look I mean gates I think it's a compelling witness he speaks in soft tones in an understated manner he's a military veteran yes he's a liar yes he's an admitted criminal but this trial is about crimes it's about bank fraud and tax fraud and gates is bringing the jury into the conspiracy soft tones and a military background and then he appeared to have found a life of crime ease our good guys all right Shannon what to the president is there anything the president should be super worried about at this point not that we know of but I think the interaction the dynamics of these two shouldn't show a bigger sense of what's going on with the different characters involved in this investigation mana Ford and gates the people had described them to me as like Batman and Robin that Gates was mana forts Ally that no one ever expected gates to flip on mana Ford but these investigations have a way of breaking down old alliances Donald Trump and Michael Cohen gates and Manta Ford and and I think that as this investigation plays out and more people are put under stress from legal fees from questions from Muller from grand jury subpoenas we are going to see a lion just like this one crumble and breakdown and I think anything goes everyone is game and all loyalties are off the table as this progresses miglin how much is on the line here if this case is successful in in getting Paul Manafort what does that do to Muller's investigation and if they're unsuccessful where do they go I mean Trump president Trump is going to be on the witch-hunt megaphone if this case doesn't work which is surprising that he could be any more on that megaphone from what we know from what from what we've heard thus far but but I think that he gets that down on top of the wall I think this prosecution would bode well for Muller if he's successful because what it will say is listen I've done the work and I've done the digging and I think that Trump would be very nervous now it's interesting a lot of people are saying that when you look at reach Gabe's testimony and how he flipped on metaphor that that's one of the things that Trump is concerned about people flipping alliances being broken but we have to remind everyone here that there should be no concern for anyone to flip on you if you've done anything wrong if you've done nothing right so so I think that that's one of the things that we have to look out here for but I think you're right I think if Muller secures a victory here is these prosecutors secure victory it will give this investigation added credibility because many people are saying you know what Muller has gone off on a tangent here he was initially tasked with just looking at whether or not Russians interfered in our election and whether or not money exactly and so there are many people who feel that this sort of angle of his investigation is not necessary it's not within the purview of the order that he was supposed to do so I think that this would give him an additional credit if you are innocent here's it if you have done nothing why would one story keep changing can I do want to ask you about the friction between the prosecutors and the judge that's been a recurring theme in this trial Stephanie this judge likes to impose his will on the courtroom in what some observers think is an officious manner as one of our analysts said some judges we contend to be the umpires it means obnoxiously sort of imposing his authority and you know some judges are can tend to be umpires this one wants to pitch and play shortstop and and I've noticed that a lot of his interference comes with the prosecutors he is he is directing their questions criticizing their questions preventing them from bringing in for example photos of the luxury goods that mana Ford purchased now some would argue you may be trying to protect them from an appeal in this case but he's certainly you know and he's trying to move the case along but sometimes by moving it along he's taking more time by requiring sidebar arguments and and asides by the judge so it's been it's been kind of maddening at times okay I gotta ask you about this even though maddening at times is Rudy Giuliani there's Washington Post report out that says president Trump's public lawyer Rudy Giuliani will send a letter that will quote largely rebuff mother's request for a presidential interview although he won't formally decline what in the world is what are we talking about here is this Rudy Giuliani just trying to run the clock and exhaust us he will answer this you want answer that I don't even understand what it matters yes it matters not because what we must have I don't think it will be successful because what do we have lately from Donald Trump we have his tweets and we have his tweets who we now know from Sean Spicer and from the current you know White House press secretary they are official innocent there are official White House statements of the President of the United States so he has already said and admitted despite the fact that he said that initial meeting at the Trump Tower was about adoptions we now know from his own words that that was about getting opposition information from from a foreign entity so we already have his things so Giuliani can run around here and said all the letters that he wants to Muller at the end of the day there is enough information here from Trump's mouth of his own doing that that he knew what was going on or perhaps there was a lot of evidence that shows that he may have known what was known we should point out yesterday Don junior told Laura Ingraham it was a bait and switch now he's saying they went for the opposition research but once the meeting started they discussed adoption none of that makes sense and remember it's never really about adoptions even if they say that that's code for Magnitsky act ie sanction hey there I'm Chris Hayes from MSNBC thanks for watching MSM be see on youtube if you want to keep up to date with the videos we're putting out you can click subscribe just
