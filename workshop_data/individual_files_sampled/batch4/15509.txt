it's going to feel like deja vu because we are talking about the NFL again the NFL announced yesterday that they will find and that's all franchise ball clubs for their players showing disrespect for the anthem so that is sitting or kneeling and by proxy of course they are disrespecting law enforcement and military but it does give them the option to stay in the locker room the policy was voted on by franchise owners and they passed it with a majority of the owners supporting the policy the NFL is a private organization and they have every right to mandate and enforce policies just like this the NFL took a major hit last year with support declining rapidly after numerous players from numerous teams took it upon themselves to air out their grievances in the form of disrespecting our flag and anthem we witnessed a decline in NFL merchandise sales NFL ticket sales viewership tanked I've never seen so many half-empty stadiums in my life it's a very smart move but I personally think that it's too late too little too late now again like any other private company they have the right to dictate company conduct it's not an infringement on a player's right to protest they are on the clock on the NFL's dime if they want to protest they can do it on their own time I think I just run after the announcement was made yesterday of course Twitter reactions just came flowing in at George atala who is assistant executive director of External Affairs at the NFLPA talked about the world's longest job title he tweeted this maybe this new rule proposal that is being voted on is a compromise between the NFL office and the club CEOs on various sides of the issue but certainly not with player leadership we weren't there or part of the discussions at by Lindsey H Joan who I believe covers the NFL for USA Today she tweeted this a compromise implies there were negotiations and the sides met in the middle that might be the case among owners but leaving players out of protest policy discussion is a major mistake there is no mandate that necessitates your involvement or the players involvement in this issue they are the employee they are not the employer if you don't like the company's rules quit you don't run the company the same people who are ticked that the NFL a private company is enforcing their own rules saying that it violates the First Amendment they are the same people who think that because Twitter is a private company they can ban whoever they want ie conservatives so which is it lefties you are conflating your arguments and you are being hoisted on your own petard but will this make a difference yeah I think that it is a pre-emptive attempt to prevent issues when the football season begins in September they are trying to get ahead of the problem and get it out of the way so that they can start reaping the fiscal benefits of being in play this fall but I think for a lot of Americans the damage is done they are done with the NFL and they've found other sports or hobbies to occupy their time from September to February and I don't really blame them thanks so much for watching everybody have a great day I'm Amanda head for the rebel if you enjoyed my commentary and opinions we've got an unlimited supply of them here at the rebel so subscribe to our premium content at www.affordablecomm.com
