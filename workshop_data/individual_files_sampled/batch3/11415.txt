Affairs here I'm billing Table one the Foreign Minister Lavrov will attend an opening of an exhibition dedicated to this event the exhibition brings together copies of important diplomatic documents since the establishment of diplomatic relations between our country in 1838 and up to the visit by the president of Serbia that took place in December of 2017 this exhibition is in other proof that our people share common affection that is founded on common memories okay and now I would like to go to the international agenda well first of all I would like to express gratitude for the Compassion's that people all over the world starting from the heads of state and to the common folk have expressed in relation to the tragedy that took place on the 11th of February in the Moscow region talking about the N 148 plane crashing Russia has received messages from dozens for heads of different states as well as the health of different international organizations and ambassadors as well as many religious leaders and in many countries just common fall came to the embassies of the Russian Federation bringing flowers in order to express condolences and I'd like to say that we are grateful to everyone present remain indifferent to this tragedy and express their condolences and their support and now I would like to go to the situation in Syria the political live in Syria over the last week has been guided by the outcomes of the Syrian National Dialogue Congress well I'd like to remind you that it took place on the 29th 30th January in Sochi it brought together representative for different political forces and civil society as well as at the confessional groups they called for the unity of the country and transition to the peace life based on the principles of that had been agreed upon in order to renew the state system that was the message that those participants sent to the international community well however some attempts from external forces don't go in line with this message and the defect occupation by the way the US military is maintained I'm talking about the 55 kilometers around at tonfa has that has become a safe zone for Isis members that have not been finished off yet well in other provocative actions we witnessed in the other book on the other shore of the year for this where US military has been almost openly confronting Syrian army provoked in Turkey the United States have been sending convoys with armaments through the authority of Iraq while Turkey has been continuing its operation that is called the olive branch and the fights have been very intense and fears terrorists of Hayato here are shown that is extra part and nusra have been carrying out aggressive provocations on the west of the distillation zone killing innocent people in mortar shell though well aware of that many Western countries have been quite compassionate with those people present in them almost as some fighters with what they call bloody regime in Syria they probably have then remember that so many people's in the ranks of the on neutral or not Syrians some time ago the leader of the group Abu Mohammed Al Jelani said that there is no Syrians accounted for 40% or for jihad and nusra there is lack of memory sometimes can be useful because it is much easier to model the waters unfounded ly accusing Syrian army as well as the Russian Air Forces in unprovoked is drugs and violence escalation under the strikes by the Syrian military Isis militants were driven out of the early problems and about 350 Isis members surrendered to the Syrian armed opposition we know nothing of their destiny there is some information of the ISIS websites that they have been killed but it is questionable the most important thing is ensure that they do not join the ranks if are the terrorist organization now the United States has been very vocal about the so called imprisoned Isis Isis in particular the head of Pentagon mr. Maties while in Rome meeting with anti-isis coalition he said that jihadist should not be contained in Syria because due to the continuing instability they can be liberated however the United States has not made any other concrete proposals on wood as weather what to do with those people because there are some countries that would are not happy to see those X terrorists in back in their countries we will keep a close eye on this situation and it is necessary to say that those people that commit crimes are criminally responsible on the this or this particular country jurisdiction and so he arises a question so can international terrorists be given a status of extraterritoriality another topic that I would like to address is is the allegedly the American air strike has allegedly killed Russian military Russian military we have seen such information in different media CNN New York Times Washington Post among others and I'm quoting here that many Russian military have been killed by the US air strikes in there as or Bloomberg Bloomberg says will says that there have been or 200 people some other media saying that there have been more than 100 in New York Times saying there we're talking about dozens of killed militants well one curious thing is that even before this information was published in the media the anti governmental Syrian militants published this information on in in their media using the images of NAS surface using some other images of Ukrainian military equipment well we're talking about a classical example of misinformation according to some preliminary date due to to an open confrontation we are talking about five person being killed who are supposedly our Russian citizens there are people injured but yet all this information has to be double-checked and we need to make sure what this citizenship of those people are and I would like to emphasize one more time that we're not talking about Russian military contingent so it is quite others why terrorists are trying to distribute this kind of information and why American said Oh in this is quite evident - I believe that it has been and the American initiative that have been accusing the Russian Federation in meddling in the internal affairs including during their presidential elections through social networks well well probably the United States should say and inform the public on on the number of American citizens that died in Iraq during their campaign there and I'm sure that many will be shocked by those numbers so it's better stick to your business note and do notice inform other people and I would like so also to emphasize that in the president Putin's administration as well as the Ministry of Defence have stated that they were no Russian military contingent in the area of American airstrike another topic that I would like to draw your attention to is that in the conflict zones there are a lot of people from all over the world including Russia and other countries at the border in countries some of them are that are there to take part in hostile active and well as you can understand quite easily those people who are willing to take part in still teas do not get there illegally so it is in quite difficult to track all of them well however the Ministry of Foreign Affairs as well as other governmental borders are working on each case because to protect Russian citizens abroad is one of our priorities it's ROG Russian citizen has a right to be protected by the state even if this person violates the Russian law and I would like to emphasize one more time that were talking about the conflict zone where people are witnessing hostile hostilities and violent activities and our diplomats are doing all they can and those biased articles are only making their work much more difficult another thing that I would like to say about Syria is the press release by technical secretary to the OPCW about the effect finding mission in Syria and the F of M has started to investigative resources on the use of toxic chemicals in the east guta and illy province in January well according to the documents they are looking into the materials from open sources as well as they are conducting interviews with the witness has started medical medical records and other protein sample analysis well in other words they are continuing the remote investigations so there is one thing that we need to understand that we cannot take at face value the statements by interested parties like Syrian opposition and affiliated angel the only way to find out the truth is declared evidence on the impact size because it is otherwise it is impossible to find who has used the arms and how the representatives of Jaysh al-islam group have said they were ready to grant an access to the OPF FM professionals to the regions of Kamara's and other regions and to ensure their security at those sites well we hope that OPCW experts will stop trying to investigate this incident remotely and will visit the impact site and will collect samples necessary for this investigation included topic we also may notice about the statements made by the press service of the State Department of the yes regarding the fact that the u.s. in Syria is it for two reasons the first one is to destroy the ISIS and their to stabilize the situation in the country like to draw attention to the fact that few months ago it was only one reason the presence of the u.s. in the territory of the sovereign state of Syria namely on the fight against the ISIS someone's paused and now there are two reasons innocence the actions of the years raised a lot of questions and the DS actions are undertaken without the invitation about the legitimate Syrian government without any sanctions of UN Security Council sanctions nonetheless for the interests of fighting terrorism Russia decided to come to terms with the u.s. servicemen because we have been told that the only reason for a stay in the air off of the you Coalition is fighting the isis and these very structure of the isis had been destroyed but now and now then then our us colleagues present other explanations and they say that the these process should be ended by the transition by the change of the regime now the Americans tried to play the Kurdish card and the pursue of the unilateral interests that they're aimed at undermining other stability in Syria rather than strengthening the regime now we'd like to focus on the fact that the words really and their statements really differ they are different we haven't received any question any answers to the our anxieties that we rose during our meetings and publicly first we need to do it publicly because we did not get any response as for these discrepancies our American colleagues usually attack us and blame us for escalating the violence in the Syria and for making great deal of victims in the year and for citing the accusations against Damascus on the use of chemical weapons I do not rule out that these fake these news these pieces of news are also connected to the topic and we would like to remind you once again that the settlement of the situation in Syria should be in line with the resolution to - of 5'4 of all these years Security Council and we need to normalize the situation in line now whether the process started in Sochi by the Congress of the National Dialogue and its statement was published in the available resources of our ministry and you can familiarize yourselves with these information once again I would like to go to other topics on the 17th of February it will be 120 anniversary of establishment of diplomatic relations between Russia and Ethiopia and 1898 the Russian had of the extraordinary mission mr. la cifra handed credential to the Emperor Menelik ii now all relations are based on the traditions of friendship a mutual respect and fruitful cooperation if he Opia is a very important partner of russia in africa and we maintain very intensive political dialogue based on a similar perception of the things happening in the world and we see great potential for reaching in reaching our cooperation in our trade and the economic sphere and also in the energy including the nuclear energy and in different fields of for the fundamental and applied science science and education and we expected to see an exchange of their messages between the foreign ministers of our countries and Moscow and the disabled host number of events coinciding dating to coincide with this event and the Embassy of Russia in Addis Abeba will hold a solemn reception with the participation of the leadership of the Foreign Minister of Ethiopia and different public figures now we will go to the situation in Ukraine I would like to say to speak about the anniversary of our the means agreement as you know it is it's it's the three-year anniversary after the signing of the package of the main Minsk agreement thanks to the document we managed to avoid the escalation of the process and it's dipping into the civil civilian rule the special rule to Napa was proposed including their different political steps it was supposed that this measures could make us find a way to the conflict until 2015 but the didn't work that we inspired instead of helping to implement Minsk agreements they started to sabotage to blur and to block the negotiation process not even one of the points of the items of how the package was implemented and there are still shelling shellings and conflicts in this territory lightly initiated by the Ukrainian authorities and here for still reluctant to maintain Charlotte with the representatives of foreign ask a little Hans so they still wanted to implement - these are forceful a solution of phosphorus Ellucian in the occupied territories which is confirmed by the approval of the law on the reintegration of them busts though we still have a searing hot bath of tension and Ukraine is totally there's total responsibility for that a Moscow is convinced that the Minsk agreements are the only basis and the only way to settle the Ukrainian crisis the faster they will get to the realization of the sooner we'll see the end of the conflict we also commented the persecution of the executive editor of the mr. gucchy of these news cost uh News Agency astronaut UA and now this Lukesh a bitch or the Permanent Representative Russia to the OSE demanded quick response regarding this situation the measures against these journalists eager good Georgia is a signer of Ukrainians fighting against any dissent in the country and on the 8th of April Karenina security agencies came to search of the this office of our the newspaper vesti so we see that the situation in Ukraine are still denigrates and this is with the support of all the relevant law enforcement agencies and up to now up to the press release of the representatively of the OSCE on the freedom of the media these statement this press release is still lacking previous time we got other questions with the request to assess a good strategy of for the year EU regarding now the Western Balkans we because they did a lot of attention to the document Center to your comments and to your questions and on the 6th of February the European Commission elaborated this tragedy for the Western Balkans and Inter stated of the genetical tasks of strengthening the EU role in this region and we have repeatedly stated that we this we had no inconveniences with that if these candidates to enter the EU are not faced with the artificial a choice are you with the EU or with Russia so when candidates are made to join the restrictions and the sanctions against their will we hope that the European Union will draw the conclusion out of this deplorable experience of these projects of the Eastern Partnership and it seems that that a space fighter for these importance of such criteria for the candidates the the main motive of this tragedy was that the euro candidate needed to me to the deadlines and this is the fact that we need to actually deny this practice of our prodding and fitting into some kind of our criteria we need to recover the situation in the Balkans and the tree stability and the inter-ethnic khamenei this concerns these water issues and the state denomination relating to Macedonia nonetheless its situation around and let alone the situation of these in Kosovo we are convinced that we need to resolve the situation in Kosovo in life with the resolution 1912 of what if they offered the UN Security Council we cannot help but be feel integrated with the comments expressed in European media including India news on this tragedy and there were hints that that noon hurt some advantages to join these block and so they expressed the kind of understanding of how candidates should enter the certain NATO alliance I'd like to express our view use and express our share our comments on the tenth anniversary of the so-called declaration of the consular statehood of course this is we to look into the inglorious outcome of these policy pursued by a Pristina and mentor which is meant to attune leghul I said to give a later statute in the network - 1999 of course these aggression and secession didn't contribute to the principles of international law and by the efforts of its benefactors Kosovo has turned into another black hole with very strange and weird status the hopes for unanimous and faster recognition by the international community didn't come true and now there is a internal divide in early structure and the practice of these pattern have been applied in Kosovo ardent work and now we'll have a precarious semi puppet regime where decisions are made while dictated by the Western diplomats now this situation is used for the placement of a NATO infrastructure contrary to the region 12:44 of the UN Security Council and without approval for the processes happen in the year the unilateral declare declaration of independence and didn't resolve all the economic problems of that region now Kozma is still the poorest a territory of the region and there is rampant crime and corruption and there is a conflict of client a client based interest problems in thieves fear of security and vulnerability to the terrorist threats from of the Middle East so we have a question what should Priscilla celebrate and the drop yourself are these projects do not have anything to make very stop after these unilateral declaration of independence I recall that in a lot of our media outlets and in maybe it was in CNN there was an advertisement and the main slogan was that Kosovo is the land of opportunity so you have this country now and you have these opportunities so at that time I was interesting who are paid for such an advertisement in CNN and you know you know that it is a very expensive thing I would like also to comment on the visas issued here of American visas issued in Russia this topic was recommended by a service America sit down the ninth the Alpha February I would like to say that we are surprised by the way our American colleagues and representative of the yes present this topic the topic of issue in American visas in Russia this is a deplorable actually situation but this we are not to blame for this because of many hostile actions and activities of Washington and Sun and sanctions and the seizure of our diplomatic missions we had to downsize the personnel of US mission missions here up to the level that we have the personnel here in the US and we didn't dictate who worst was to be dismissed or downsized but the American Authority I decided to downside the visa section so it was their own decision as far as as we understand it was a political target for arousing out the consent of the public by the Russian decision so it was like an attempted to redirect these blow and to make it hit Moscow as you know that it is very hard to get American visa and it has been long before out that fact about her for 15 years the residents of Russian regions have actually to go to Moscow to st. Petersburg taken a book and a bloody festival I did was stalked spent the money and time now these EU Emissions radically increased the scale of this work now they started her to issue these about her to a limited extent and now this scale and level is a three times a lower than it was before and official term for waiting for the interviews is about 85 days about three months but it's still not observed because unit cannot make an appointment the official website I would like to reiterate that it is the competence the jurisdiction of the US and you cannot blame Russia for that because it's absurd this is a an intent to redirect the attention to somehow lay the fault in somebody else's door and they said that Russia itself had created some obstacles by elevating the price for the visas for American citizens now I would like to clarify that the US citizens who do not have any face any difficulties and the Russian agreement and agreement on facilitating the visa issuance of 2011 doesn't have any fixed these are fees so now according to the legislation are they 90 our dollars are for single entry visa $144 for double entry visas and $270 for of multiple visas actually Americans prefer to obtain single entry visas because it's cheaper and these differs from what Russian as it is unsafe for the American visas a $160 US dollars it's very surprising that this was an issue was raised about the accrues of Aeroflot and Russian athletes about the expedited issuance of their visas because this is in line with the international obligation of the US and last autumn there was a situation that Arafat was not able to continue flying out to the EU or to the United States because the pilots didn't have a visa appropriate visas and our air transportation was endangered at that time did you from 1994 provides for the United States that have to issue visas to their crews in timely manner well there have been other similar problems for Russian sports athletes who had troubles getting into international competitions well it seems that the United States have forgotten then when they are hosting some sport events they have to grant an access to all the participants it meaning that the non issuing visas to your Russian athletes can be considered premeditate discrimination in the Russian Federation and that's we had we have taken notice so that and we had to indicate that well well of course we are outraged saying that due to American and visa restrictions many many representatives of cultural community as well as just ordinary people have to cancel their travels it looks like the United States is against Russian citizens traveling and entering their country but probably they will bring some information some truthful information about Russia the United States probably afraid of that I'd like to say that two years ago the State Department stripped off the accreditation of five of our representatives they were trying to enhance contacts between our peoples and we will attack tackle those areas so during the ordinary regular consultations on consular issues they were supposed to take place last year well but however the United States decided to delay them if if we see if we see a wish to address those issues so why do it in the media we can do we're face to face so let's not try it to ruin it let's try to address those seizures immediately another topic that I would like to address it a second world war on the 30th on the oh in January I have talked about the message of mr. tomski he's director of the Polish Institute for international relations in his Twitter he said that it was the Netherlands not Poland who was blocking the axis of the Russian Federation to the participation international managing committee of the project of the new museum in Sabah more we said that we had to double-check this information well according to the information that I have the Netherlands Earth rotates have been saying that that was not true so who is lying and other Netherlands lying say other people from Poland lying so so so is it so hard just to tell the truth I would like to emphasize one more time that one of the Russian priorities is to be a full-fledged member of or the project because there was some prisoners from the USSR there and under the leadership of the Russian military officer pachowski in October of 1943 they rebuilt in Sobibor that was the only successful one during the Second World War and there are many documents in the Russian air cards that could enrich the exposition of that museum and there is also one thing that allow you to say a lot of people say so why do you need who participate in this project so what's the big deal we're living in an open or information space so when anything is published you can get an access to it so here is what can happen on the 8th of February in soulless peel memorial complex was held an opening of new exposition presenting a new version of the celestials history that has been promoted by the Latvian authorities well according to regard solace peace has not been a death camp like us vensim order how well allegedly that people didn't there due to violent reasons but due to some illnesses or sicknesses and the number of people and died there his underestimated well according to those well according to archives of about fifty three thousand people died in that camp this exhibition focuses on so-called crimes by the Soviet and German occupation forces and led hair doesn't has nothing to do that and it was just hostage to those historical circumstances and nothing is said about the sabbath soldiers that liberated cells pills and well by the way the russian ambassador wasn't invited to that event well the reasons are quite obvious and nothing is said about the experiments on children that were carried out in that camp by the nazi nazis and so this attempt to destroy this memory about violence in solo space let alone camp at the official level is or is an issue of a great concern and it testifies to the fact that the falsification of history in latvia is on the rise so that's there's just I wanted to say how everything is done done now how the history is being rewritten I'd like to address some other topics on the 8th of February the Estonian intelligence published a document on this security in this country so well this document is completely and Russian it is quite evidence that there is one thing that I would like to take to emphasize well I have looked through their materials on the topic and will according to the media and well I'd like to emphasize one more time they're talking about the report on the security state in Estonia so this documents mentions Stonier only 37 times while Russia's mentioned 458 times well and only as a threat to stolen sovereignty so it seems that if you just look at those figures that the the threat is ten times larger than the state so it cannot but baffle us because arrow gives a lot of fun found information about the alleged aggressiveness of its eastern neighbor well it's a shame that instead of will giving balanced analysis the authors of the document are offering and well just some anti-russian Clee share in spy spirit so so are they calling for Estonians not to contact with the Russians so our old maybe Russian student travel history probably they are posing some kind of a threat to Estonian citizens well it is some kind of intimidation all for their own citizens and and well just they're trying to intimidate those people who are trying to work productively and efficiently with their partners abroad okay so here are some issues related to the information area on the on the 8th of February Estonian service prohibited some channels by Russia not all here due to supposedly violating some local laws well taken into account this situation in taking account the same thing that happened to the anti-villain wha well we cannot was see that these words is just a politically charged and well local authorities are trying to censor independent media well repeatedly this Commission has stalled broad cons broadcasting odd-odd here channel there and trying to move it to the TV channels on a payment based basement but the liberty of thought of expression means that everyone can express their opinion regardless of what the government likes like not well this repressive policy by Lithuania probably is just generally charged goes in line with the current situation in the European Union when it comes to Russian media we believe that as a decision is another hostile act against Russia median and well it is an act all for open discrimination well by the way this violates the international law and are unacceptable in the modern democratic society so we call upon the international community to take notice of this fact and to state clearly what I think about it we believe that we should would like to hear the official position all for the European Union of the OSCE and the corresponding European bodies because Lithuania is trying to use the name so for your some European bodies another similar situation took place in Moldova well we have already commented upon the coke code on radio and television that the factor prohibits broadcasting Russian news channels on the 24th of January the Russian State Duma you should a special statement saying that it is an admissible to discriminate Russian medium meanwhile the international community is very slow to react we are witnessing repressions against the media in that country the first victim is TV a gauzy that was fined for not complying with some requirements and we believe that this law is an act of violation of international law and it is aimed to move away the novel unfavorable sources which is unacceptable in the modern democratic society here is another thing that I would like to we have received a lot of questions and we are happy that you are interested in this topic and we'll about the elections the Ohio election process organising abroad and we would like to just say a couple of words about that I will give you a question and I will give you an answer so could you please key was the figures on different countries where the number of voters is the highest well of course in the context of Russian presidential elections well according to the information of one of the first generally in Germany were talking about almost half a million and more than hundreds of people in a pezzi Estonia Lithuania Ukraine on you in Kazakhstan is seven to three thousand Belarus here 67 alleged via sixty three thousand of voters so that is the top 10 we are planning to so we are planning to send some officials to the two other countries in order to help in organizing the electoral process yes we are planning to do that we are sending people the officials from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and shall we going to organise the elections in those countries where the 18th of March is a holiday really yes in many Islamic countries the 18th of March is actually a business day and so so the voters can go and vote they can do that to the closest holiday and it's the Friday 16th of March so are you planning to organize this away voting's for those citizens they cannot attend who I can attend there on the 18th of March little a lot of people are living away from the cities well one can vote and not everyone have an opportunity to go there that day would due to the high expenses of traveling or due to some medical conditions or for example a person cannot just attend elections or due to work well etc how well due to some timetable peculiarities etc well of course well you can say that about people who work at the customs about well aviators and the United Nations officers and there will be preliminary voting organized for such voters so how are you going to organize electoral process and Latvia and Estonia this year Latvia and Estonia didn't let us to increase the number of voting sites and we have already commented on this so it will make the process more difficult and many people will not be able to attend the voting so we will carry out the voting there were two days on the 17th and 18th of March and so and see that the people living in San Francisco where the consulate has been closed will also be able to do that well of course the fact that the consulate in San Francisco has been closed has complicated our work but we have worked in order to organize the proper voting process well this time as all fortune of February or the Minister of Foreign Affairs has created 378 voting sites you know in more than 150 countries all over the world well all information about candidates too can be found on the corresponding websites and you can find the information on corresponding sites what can you say about electoral activity of people even abroad of Russian citizen living living abroad so that's not actually another question for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs but rather to some experts in this area we will do all we can in order to inform all Russian citizens living abroad so in order they will be able to vote them and we will try to make sure that the elections are organized efficiently in each particular country taking into account its special and specific characteristics we will try to find and fix the right dates and plays etc so if so what documents do people traveling abroad are being abroad during the elections they need to have all the information is published or at the website of this Central Electoral Commission and we would also recommend Russian citizens to visit the our embassies websites as well as the websites of the Consulate's of the country where they will be at that day well it's actually very useful because you can find the numbers of hotlines that you can use in emergencies and you can find all the information on how you can contact Russian diplomats so well first of all you need to go to the website of the our representation offices our missions abroad and you will find there all the necessary telephones their timetable and other important and useful information the Russian citizens in order to vote will have to present their travel passport they can be a diplomatic passport or just an ordinary travel passport and for the countries where you can enter using your ordinary national passport the Russian and national passport will be enough so how will you organize elections in Ukraine well it is quite difficult given all the circumstances well especially due to these hate atmosphere that has been nurtured by aggressive nationalist groups and and this aggression against all Russian citizens coming to the building sites in Kiev Haruko flow lyubov and Odessa well despite our messages to the crania Thorat is they this those authorities are very slow to react and well in order to maintain this order the Russian Federation was obliged to make a request to the OSCE any special mission in Ukraine in order to make ensure the security and protection oh another question I have well having some information in the media that you have some information on other countries trying to meddle into the elections well it's a very popular question and I would like to say that well unlike someone founded accusation saying that there are some who omnipotent Russian hackers and will Russian influence in on electoral processes in other countries we actually have some country effects of destruct destructive interference from other countries okay during the a briefing for OSCE ambassadors as well as the partners of this organization on the 19th of February well I'm sorry I just didn't say the round eight I need to double-check it well on those channels and we'll be distributed the information on that this kind of activity this kind of work should be stopped otherwise we will have to act against it and including in the public space so all the materials that we will gather will be published or we will inform our partners and the colleagues that it is inadmissible to act in that matter another so I just noted notice

Elia for that Yerevan is the territory original territory of Azerbaijan and the recovery of this territory is a strategic goal of Azerbaijan so this statement announced by this leader and we think that in this regard this doesn't a contributor to listening the tensions between the those countries I will have our two questions excuse me who I represented to us Putin in Belarus thank you first of all you mentioned Minsk agreements and for three years of existence they have been proposed also to remove from these florrum from Minsk do you think that Belarus ensures all the necessary conditions for this contact group and this week we had Canton these statement offered an report of the conflict and Russia views Belarus that as a buffer zone in these Western relationship this statement was about this actually many of these representatives of the American establishment make such statement and I can say only in general that that you should not be facing the choice if you are with us or against us we do not draw any such lines especially when speaking about our neighboring country or a friendly country of belarus belarus is our strategic partner and this is a high level of relations i cannot be constructed without the respect for the right to conduct sovereign policy and we have always pursued this multifaceted cooperation with this country as for the platform for the forum what we were speaking about you were speaking about minsk yes he was they were radial of proposals to remove these four and from Minsk do you think that Belarus is a suitable venue for these talks a lot of members of Russian leadership have mentioned that the most important thing is this that this process should be the result the its fruit and we actually give all the necessary support when it is required so the most important thing for this process to be effective because there are some cases when they speak about something that obstructs the process and find a lot of our pretext in but in this case everyone should concentrate on implementing the Minsk agreements and I would reiterate that the events held in Belarus were organized on a very high level and the hospitality and the high level was always has been oh we have been always noticed and there were always things about these events marilla's Amira as for the zones of de-escalation how do you engage in expanding the term and on the situation in a free no is molest who is hindering the process and about the organizational committee how do you assess the this it's work on the first question mr. Lavrov commanded this question in a detail and based on the sort of the data off of the Ministry of Defense as poor mr. Mistura we firmly support his activities and we wanted to give an impulse give an impetus to the activities in the Geneva platform and we wish success to him in this very important and difficult mandate we think that it's essential to give an impetus and we speak about that directly with alloted this two-hour lesson colleagues and mr. mr. enjoys full support of Russia in this context and also the support of what the whole Geneva process which was spoken about by Russian representatives tomaron gusano father brought to a channel Minister foreign minister of our Germany has recently spoke about the need for silver for Serbia to recognize cough so if it wants to enter the European Union why do you think that why Brussels Center building plays such a criteria for the candidates when Cyprus Spain and others that they have not yet recognized Kosovo I think this questioner should be asked to the relevant European structures to Brussels because they should comment on what is the basis of their position we have never pursue such a policy in regarding this region or any other region of the world and we have always stated the necessity of developing friendly relations and cooperation in Europe and we have always contributed to developing the bilateral relations between this regional our country and this region of the world which is very interesting for us from economic point-of-use why this conditions such preconditions are being announced we actually have no idea maybe this is a reflection of anti-russian spirits it is no secret that the European bodies contain some forces that do not want to build the friendly relations with Russia but at the same time there are other political forces and on the part of the political establishment which advocates the integration processes like in the EU space and also in the post-soviet space they do not see anything about anything and did not oppose recovering the relations with Russia so maybe here we can see are the willingness of some bureaucrats on some politicians who did not feel close to Russia or maybe they not from close to Russia from a pragmatic state of view in reality merimna we have read in the Italian media the publication and espresso right so that putting and Russia influence the elections in this country in Italy and support of the para allá g'nort thank you for I remember before making me remember this because in the evening tomorrow an interview given by foreign minister a profile will be released it concerns many issues of Russian European relations it was given to euronews but it's a post editor with the discussion of the Russian US relations and in this interview Lavrov discusses in great detail the topic of blaming us for an interference in European affairs and I highly recommend you to watch this interview tomorrow we are open to discussing the questions the problems posed by our partners if they have any theater regarding the interference Russian interference into Italian elections we open for discussing the goodness loop because we can address some concrete situation some actions taken by the Russian Federation and there are well allegedly are not right so are there any such cases or not nobody not in the context of Italian elections or all referendum in Spain or referendum in the United Kingdom nobody has not given us any concrete information meanwhile we're hearing from all over the world that Russia is meddling into the internal affairs of those countries and these statements are made publicly by politicians however they avoid consultations are on through diplomacy channels well I remember statements by Spanish politicians when talking about their internal affairs and that well despite our continuing statements that we respect and support territorial integrity of Spain later the same politician started telling that they were not using the correct words they were not meaning that thing well probably at the at a time when they may leave statements they needed that for their internal political reasons and the same goes to Italy will give us some names figures will anything avoid any concrete accusations that you have but we there is nothing of that you can find there is nothing like that well as for your questions a question I recommend you towards an interview by Sergei Lavrov for yura news it will be broadcasted partly but the whole version will be published on the Ministry of Foreign Affairs website okay thank you well I hope that your news will show that part that I have mentioned Reykjavik is larger so please tell us are there any information from the Ministry of or Minister of Defense we got into the Aviator filly philippe off I think that : l konasana cop said that well probably those strike was made by Americans are there any data regarding this investigation so or can we expect any diplomatic political military results and the second question is not so sad seventy-five years ago they will establish diplomatic relations between Russia and Iceland are you going to celebrate it yes as for your first question we have confirmed it through a Ministry of Defense and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs the investigation is underway and when we get some concrete data that can be confirmed we will make a public statement because we are just in the middle of the process well as for your second question I will check which events are planned to celebrate this event and I will tackle address this question in more detail and we will send you this information yes please know as the Netherlands hello well I think that your only news has caused a stir in the diplomatic world because there was an something very surprising well we actually it causes no stir well in our circles because we had to answer every 10 minutes if we're we're actually expanding the head of the Dutch diplomacy in Moscow and just 15 minutes prior to his resignation we said that we were expecting him well of course we were expecting this meeting to happen but they didn't happen so the Foreign Minister resigned due to due to his previous statements they were unfounded well no nobody saying about Putin's dodge because in the Netherlands they're talking about the Putin's - no actually he was saying that I will allegedly President of the Russian Federation during the negotiations said something about a possible expansion by Russia to the neighboring countries yes but he well yes but as far as I understood he was he was at the president's dodge yes but the statements that have been considered truthful for several years was that Russia had some aggressive geopolitical intentions and people making such statements were referring to who - the President of Russia who allegedly said that and that the Dutch Minister allegedly attended that meeting but well if you have found out that that was untrue but we have repeatedly said that and that isn't actually the first time when some high-profile politicians made some untruthful statements and a Russian side denounced them we actually proposed to publish theof about the bottom reports of those negotiations and every time after that we have started that doing notes from the beginning but only when the number of those fake statements increased and has been increasing in order to just lower the grade of of the heat the degree of the heat so when some countries let themselves to say some untruthful information so that's why we have repeatedly proposed to publish the written records of those meetings and after that they just stopped mentioning those statements again so well probably there was something new for the Netherlands but well unfortunately for us it's it's just a routing work well I have just I was obliged to answer about some about some supposedly supposed to Russian interference into Italian electoral process and well we have our own elections that's what we'd like to stick to and as I have said there is now no news for us so we do you think that there can affect Russian and Dutch relations when it comes to when it comes to the resort for for drama with al with a plane well haven't you heard the statements that we made when very often every other week that we have some concerns and we there are some questions regarding the investigation in the Netherlands so probably not even experts in politics have not just so heard those statements because the investigation that is underway is you do not have to cite me but together to the situation around the statement of the officials of Netherlands we actually the now Dutch public doesn't hear our statement because they did not get any information when we have made such statements we get got comment of our colleagues from Netherlands that we were anxious in vain and everything was a fair game we spoke about our anxieties citing different points in that area and it's no use speaking about that it can influence the situation somehow we've been talking for me in years about that and about the Netherland the presidency of Netherlands in the UN Security Council what account do you suppose if Russia can count on the Netherlands as a new president and we wish every success you know for Netherlands you know this important amended the UN Security Council is a very important forum of war settling the situations the problems in the world many of these problems date back many years and the maximum desire to ask is the prevention of our new complex that's why we together with our UN Security Council colleagues we are focused on such work and when we wish successor to them we wish a successor to ourselves because this should be our collective success but from international global point of view no matter how long you're engaged in this information smear campaigns the truth anyhow will emerge we saw Colin Powell in with this sample in the UN Security Council now we have a very unpleasant example for the foreign regarding the foreign minister of Netherlands and these cases appear very there are many such cases actually they appear systematically we are open to answering the questions on this issue but we expect these stories to be repeated in the future people themselves start to understand that when they were engaged in spreading fake news they understand that they cannot live with it anymore you should not underestimate this factor is not a question of the journalistic investigations of spreading the information actually these people understand that they cannot operate in such a way and these people understand that they should put an end to such a practice now from briefing to briefing I cite such similar examples thank you one more thing a very important point from one point of view of course when a person confesses that he told a lie this is really real did real action but do not forget that these man this person has insisted for many years on the truth of his statements and we should not forget that the decisions were made on that basis and the voting's what were motivated by his statement and this is the destiny of our people of dodge citizens this real effect at our life and we should not forget about that good afternoon as for offering we have two questions and the the year is a Turkish separation enough rain and 100 157 citizens were killed in the course of the operation turkey and the part of our the Syrian opposition supported by haruki sister some villagers Ania offering and the assistance to stole many things from the houses who says that amoeba video actually filmed that themselves and we're publishing they're saying that they we have stolen all the turkeys and hence because cares are not Muslims well it is now that in offering women are fighting for their land and for their country and will against the Turkish country one of those women was seized by forces supported by Turkey and she was killed and later she was her clothes worth taking off her breasts were cut off and they wrote on his stomach Syrian opposition so here's my question so what's the Russian stance on this situation of it goes those crimes against humanity can I ask you a question so well have you heard for the first time about the atrocities that taking place in Syria well you knew that that over several years well the atrocities have been outrages unseen by the world over the last dozens of years so heaven we talked about that haven't we showed the footages of people and children women being killed haven't we called upon the international community to stop this violence to make sure that the peace process is in place so wouldn't that the one that we've been doing there was our aim so wasn't that that the Russian militant military contingent and Russian aviators are risking their lives so and now you're telling me that a woman was killed there so good morning to you thousands of women children and innocent civilians were killed there and people are mutilated not only physically but also mentally it isn't psychologically a mutilated nation and no one knows how much time it will take to bring this country back to life in order to revive the people because it's very diverse we're talking about Syrians and cares and other ethnic and national groups so you cannot just just cover yourself with some slogans you cannot just call upon the international community only when your house becomes a target and certainly that it's not something that Russia should be blamed blamed for because we didn't give stretch out the hand of help not when we were targeted but when they were in trouble and we were faced with so much aggression and direct threats and we saw this disapproval from other countries and we actually as to through it because we we understand that ooh one has to address I probably not when it's entering your house but when you can prevent further damages found I talks about the situation and Efrain didn't I speak on the causes of this situation a week ago and have Doretta rated today you know there is a difference yes meesa among poor maybe we'll start her program not without with the photograph above the Kadisha buoy or whether that the coach of these a woman and she will ask why are there armed these people in the region you said that it was done by the terrorist groups but actually it was backed by turkey and turkey is a partner of russian syria but let's talk about other another issue the proposal to give Efrain instead of ad escalation so this was a proposal of Russia so so this proposal is it still valid I have spoken on the situation in great detail today and I don't not have anything to add to this the question on the elections the prime minister of Bulgaria said that one thing that you cannot choose your parents and cannot choose the President of the Russian Federation it was a joke how you can could you command on these statements recently the Prime Minister Boyka berry search said that there is there are two things that you cannot choose parents your parents and the President of the Russian Federation how could you command on that I think he has a chance and he can get the become Russian citizens and go to vote yes please I'd like to speak and ask a question about the incident near Deir Ezzor that happened in February could you clarify please how many Russians were there apart from the five citizens that he spoke about you know I have announced all the information available to me I understand that there are many additional and questions but I have spoken of the situation as for today you begin and we want to have any additional information we will share with you and that's what we do each and every time so if there are no questions I would like to say one more thing that we have surprised surprise for you because this week we are celebrating a very ancient tradition that is called Maslin said goes back to the remote past Marceline's about a week is not Maslin say if there are no pancakes no blini say we'd like to invite all of you to a small degustation and our press center has organized it so this briefing has been a long one and I can see that you are hungry
