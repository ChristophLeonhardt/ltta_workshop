hey guys how you doing Jane cougar Ana Kasparian I believe this shows called The Young Turks so what do we have on tap for you guys today nothing but awesomeness throughout the network of course today we shoot two IT classes you guys get it tomorrow if you remember Steve Artie comps us join now have I told you that before and then on rebel headquarters tonight Pramila jeyapaul one of the most progressive members of Congress and one of the few just Democrat incumbents and she's the one that started the medicare-for-all caucus and PAC I love that story we're going to talk to her on rebel headquarters tonight get all 18 Young Turk shows if you're a member and and then later tonight two stories that have got me animated well three actually and I'm gonna be presenting those one is a story that we broke about Rick Scott's corruption I mean it's not just about Rick Scott it is a perfect story of how our system is broken so don't miss that one and also politico's added again complete attack on Bernie Sanders and there's a trick in there that I need to tell you about you need to understand okay do not fall for that trick okay and then my old friend owed here come Oh Jo Jenna's the only person who's giving me life right now and he doesn't even know it he doesn't even know no okay so I remember how I told you I didn't look up the polls on purpose for that story I looked him up now and so interesting interesting let's just get through all this other stuff really quick and there's another add it's another Edward he's bleeding okay I almost like told and I almost texted her last night she might you tell Miller no that's what it was how dare you tell Miller okay anyway we got more of that a little bit in the program okay but Ana take it away all right so actually yeah two quick things that I wanted to talk to you guys about before we get started with the stories first one of our members had written on I think online a question about why it is that I call out some of the graphic numbers sometimes I don't do it all the time I do it time to time and I wanted to answer that question for anyone who's curious about it so as you guys know this show is not scripted there's no teleprompter and while you guys see us on a daily basis doing the work there are angels in the background who are doing a lot of really hard work behind the scenes those are our crew members and producers oftentimes I will go out of order when I'm presenting a story and presenting certain graphics and so I don't want to confuse the crew I want to make sure they know what I'm about to toss to and that's why sometimes I mentioned the graphic number if I'm going out of order so that's one thing okay I'd like to note angels a bit over stereo new show scripted so whoever's directing knows exactly what they're gonna do next whereas with our show it's a spontaneous conversation and sometimes all tossed to a video were a graphic and they'll have no warning so that's basically okay I don't know about angels but I know Jesus is back there all right and then one other quick thing so Ann Coulter backed out of a debate with Kyle kolinsky because she's a coward and she was recently interviewed on Fox 11 here in Los Angeles and she thought that she would take a little dig at me because she claims I she's written a bunch of books and I have it right with your life okay and a bunch of rich people buy your books in bulk it's a totally fake yeah here's the thing your books didn't help you as I was handing you your own ass during the debate last year so please spare me your ridiculous books with countless falsities okay okay so you respond to that quickly that's just that just country yeah okay how dare you Ann Coulter okay now with that all out of the way let's get to the news right okay the Washington Post has published the final column written by Jamal Khashoggi it was written by Khashoggi but his assistant has published it and the message in this column is incredibly important because he is specifically calling out the lack of freedom of expression in Arab countries and it gives you a sense of what his thoughts were not only as he was living in self-exile here in the United States but as he was entering that consulate the issues that he had you know in the back of his mind when it came to the very country that he was from so I want to give you a few excerpts from his column and then we'll discuss so in one portion of the column he says there is only one country in the Arab world and here he's referencing a 20-18 freedom in the world report he says there's only one country in the Arab world that has been classified as free that nation is Tunisia Jordan Morocco and Kuwait comes second with a classification of partly free the rest of the countries in the Arab world are classified as not free so as you can notice there he does call out Saudi Arabia as not free because it's not listed as partly free or free and then he says a state-run narrative dominates the public psyche and while many do not believe it a large majority of the population falls victim to this false narrative sadly this situation is unlikely to change so he's specifically referring to the state-sponsored propaganda in Arab countries and Saudi Arabia is certainly no exception the Saudi royals want to control the narrative and the messaging that the Saudi citizens consume and so that is the main reason why someone like Jamal khashoggi who was highly critical of the Saudi royals decided to live in self-exile here in the United States yes look obviously this is incredibly powerful because it comes from the grave and they noted in the Washington Post that they did not want to run it because they hoped he was still alive but now that Hope has basically been extinguished so they were running of posthumously and I want to call out one other thing that he said in the article that I think is really important he mentioned Sully el shaggy who's a prominent Saudi writer who's now he he said serving an unwarranted five-year prison sentence for a supposed comments contrary this Saudi establishment now of course we now know that Jamal Khashoggi was very likely murdered by that same Saudi establishment I say very likely because you have to but we know what happened and so I noted something that I have not seen elsewhere but I hope that others are pursuing this my guess is human rights groups are etc that's Lal Shah he is still life so if you want justice for Khashoggi a very small step in that direction but a good step would be to release him from prison that's the bare bare minimum that the Saudi government can do exactly so other portions of his piece that I wanted to share with you he says Arab governments have been given free reign to continue silencing the media at an increasing rate there was a time when journalists believed the internet would liberate information from set from the censorship but these governments have aggressively blocked the internet and I appreciate that he mentioned that and he specifically goes back to 2011 when there was this emergence of people who were protesting and really challenging people in positions of power in the Arab world and there was that glimmer of hope I remember that and then it just kind of faded away as as those movements got co-opted by terrorist organizations as the you know leaders in these countries became even more aggressive in in censoring speech censure censoring non state-sponsored media and again this is exactly the type of commentary that would get him murdered in Saudi Arabia which is why he came here to the United States and became a u.s. resident so the part of Internet's really important and I really hope that VPNs are successful and get these restrictions because if you don't know what a VPN is it allows your computer to go to another computer so they can't tell that you're right and one outside the country so you can actually access some of the other the websites that are banned in places like Saudi Arabia because it appears that your computers in the Netherlands not in Saudi Arabia now this is really taking off in China and and I hope it does so more even more so in in all those places to get around the censorship of these oppressive governments but I didn't want to breeze past the first part of that sentence he said Arab governments have been given free rein to continue silencing the media at an increasing rate I mean and that turned out to be his last column as they silenced them in the most extreme way imaginable and so as I read that portion it was haunting that he was warning about silencing of the media and they literally beheaded him also I mean he says Arab governments have been given free rein given free free rein from whom right and by whom by whom yes and it's the u.s. the u.s. exactly and that's exactly what's happening right now I mean the narrative that we're seeing from the Trump administration and later we'll also talk about some conservatives in the United States who are part of the media like they're making excuses for what happened and they're protecting the Saudis and what they did know I mean look just mentioned briefly here I asked yesterday will the Magra guys rally to Donald Trump defending a Muslim fundamentalist government dismembering someone we got our answer today yes so now conservatives are starting to attack khashoggi the victim mm-hmm calling him a radical Islamists so the smear job on the victim has begun we see that here in America all the time you know a young unarmed black gay kids killed it's time to smear him and destroy his reputation after you've already killed him so now they've started to do that to khashoggi so let me just ask a quick question what type of radical extremist would want freedom of speech freedom of press wouldn't a radical extremists want censorship wouldn't they want to prevent messages getting out there that counter whatever it is that they believe but look you know I'm gonna offend people as usual here but this is why I call those extreme Republican voters stupid because there's nothing that they won't buy all you have to do is you have to have an official propaganda outlet of the Republican Party tell them oh yeah no no Muslim fundamentalists beheading people and dismembering them is now great now you are to bow your head and say that that is wonderful and here they are now all over the internet going well Khashoggi this and khashoggi that's smearing him etc all lies by the way all totally out of context lies and so they've decided yeah we the right wing in this country that said all Muslims should be banned now think Trump covering up for a fundamentalist Muslim dictator beheading someone is a good thing I would hope that they would read this and learn something from it but they're not gonna learn anything you have to read yeah they'd have to actually take the time to read something instead of sitting there and watching whatever propaganda you know they've been consuming including Fox News it's easy to sit there and just buy whatever it is that they're selling but look just first second take the Muslim component out of it and think about what this means he was a u.s. resident okay he was living here in the United States he was murdered likely murdered when he went to that consulate what does that mean for journalists who practice free speech in a country like the United States who-who take advantage of our First Amendment rights and and share their opinions put out you know their articles or their news content so we're just going to give certain countries a pass if they murder journalists just because we have cozy ties with them just because we have financial ties with them where's all my right-wing free speech advocate friends free speech on Berkeley's campus oh you've been headed a guy who was speaking out against the Saudi government no problem let's cover it up let's cover Trump told us to cover it up let's cover it up so boy you must be really proud of your free speech philosophy well the New York Times has more details on how khashoggi was likely murdered and I want to share I want to share these details with you guys so you understand the severity of what happened and and what the Trump administration is planning on doing to cover this all up all right Turkish officials and investigators are slowly but surely leaking more details about how Khashoggi was allegedly murdered by Saudi officials now Jamal khashoggi was of course a u.s. resident who was writing columns for The Washington Post he was living in self-exile out of fear that the Saudi officials would come after him and murder him and if we are to believe the Turkish investigators Saudi officials did murder him as he was going into the Turk the Saudi consulate in Istanbul now we're learning more details about how this murder was allegedly done and it's very gruesome so according to the latest report in The New York Times Saudi agents were waiting when Jamal khashoggi walked into their country's consulate in Istanbul mister khashoggi was dead within minutes beheaded dismembered his finger severed and within two hours the killers were gone to me the most troubling part I mean every part of his or if eclis troubling they couldn't tell if his fingers were severed while he was alive or after he was dead the the head and the other limbs they that's what they brought the bone saw for and and presumably to be able to carry him away easier and conceal it but the fingers there's no reason to cut those after he's dead likely they cut him while he was still alive so the Turkish authorities say that they have audio recordings of what happened and so as a result they can hear who was present and what they said now according to the new york times after khashoggi was shown into the office of the south consul the agency's Khashoggi almost immediately and began to beat and torture him eventually cutting off his fingers again we don't know if they cut off his fingers while he was alive or dead now the Consul was present according to these audio recordings and objected he allegedly said do this outside you will put me in trouble and one of the Saudi officials responded with if you want to live when you come back to Arabia shut up remember they can escape goes somebody right because they the guy who very very very very likely ordered it is the leader of Saudi Arabia Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman or now apparently bonesaw Salman and and so they're not gonna turn around and go yeah the monarch did it that's not how monarchies work so they'll have to say that they took stern action once they found out who the rogue killer was so I don't know if they'll pin it on the console because he objected for like one second in the middle of the murder about where they killed him not whether they should kill him or they'll pin it on somebody and right now everybody on that 15 person team has to be incredibly nervous because somebody's gonna get a scapegoated and likely they'll kill that guy too because they don't want him hanging around even if it's in a Saudi prison because he knows the real story so and remember as we spoke about on a previous show both the New York Times and Turkish investigators identified several of the 15 Saudi officials who were present and so if people know who they are and they also know that these individuals have close ties to the Saudi royals who knows what's in the future for them and it's it is a scary thing to consider so another thing to keep in mind is that one of the people one of the Saudi officials who was there and who was ID'd was a Saudi doctor he was a medical professional and as the agents cut off khashoggi 's head and dismembered his body the doctor did have some advice he told them listen to music as he donned headphones himself that was what he did to ease the tension when doing such work the doctor explained and the doctor had published work in dissection so maybe that's what he was referring to there but either way it's just incredibly gruesome and to know that the US government is going to try to cover up for the Saudi officials or for the Saudi royals is incredibly discouraging and terrifying so a couple more things here the first of all and the doctor I don't know what you don't get picked to be the doctor on the 15 person assassination team by accident so it might have been autopsies he was referring to or might have been other beheadings it's not like the Saudi government doesn't do beheadings they do beheadings the real fundamentalist version of Sharia law there's actually a lot of different variants of Sharia law and some are benign and some are terrible and the Saudi government practices a terrible kind the same kind that Isis practices and we go all we have to start a war with Isis and defense contractors got to get paid and we got to cause chaos in the Middle East well Saturday Arabia has very very similar conduct as Isis in terms of fundamentalist Sharia law beheadings public torture etc right an oppression of anyone living under their rule incredibly similar ideology but hey they're an ally and they got oil and they back Israel in US against Iran Wow so understand what you're dealing with here this is not likely to be the first time that the that it beheading has happened under the rule of Saudi Arabia this particular reign okay secondly animation the Turkish government doing slow leaks here why now that this is what other outlets can't really talk about this is our analysis but I will give New York Times credit for getting as close as they can it's because the Turkish government has not received their end of the bargain so I told you what the American government has gotten so far the Turks gave us pastor Brunson the Saudis gave us a hundred million dollars that we asked for help in Syria they all happened at the same time and that's all we're told there are coincidences of course preposterous there are deals being made behind the scenes to assuage the situation but apparently the Turks have not and and I said yesterday on the show so far publicly we seeing what the Turks have gotten and they they need to get something and they're holding the audio recordings in their back pocket as leverage you can see the show yesterday's show you can see me saying that and today they're leaking stuff because apparently they didn't get their end of the bargain so I love what the New York Times said about it they talked about how the investigators in Turkey are actually very well respected and so is their intelligence organization but the press unfortunately is not very free in Turkey used to be but not on this current government so then they explained that quote so the resumption of disclosure there's about mr. Khashoggi disappearance is more likely to reflect a decision by the Turkish president than a burst of muckraking zeal it's exactly right it isn't like wow we find something how got the leak no airdog office comes in goose all right they didn't give us the money we wanted or whatever it is that we wanted leaked this part leaked that part tell them about the fingers tell them about the beheading because they have the tapes right okay and they're holding on to the tapes as their last card look if the Saudis don't give us what we want whatever it is we release the tapes so that's the negotiation that's happening behind the scenes and finally there is one other negotiation going on independent of this but related to it our own TYT investigative reporting team broke the story the State Department is actively seeking US contractors to aid Saudi Arabian prison officials Wow oh boy and so apparently this is for the female prisons I hope we don't teach them to sever fingers while their people are still alive I hope we don't teach them that any of this torture is acceptable we've done torture in the past I'm sorry enhanced interrogation right right I guess Dick Cheney would also call this enhanced interrogation you know very enhanced interrogation what happened to khashoggi so check out that story we'll have a link down below for another great job I can't equip and sign-on TYT investigates but if we are giving aid and comfort to the Saudi government whether it's in executing their war in Yemen in covering up this crime or training him on on prison we should at a bare minimum reconsider that and and for sure make absolutely positive that we're teaching them the right things I mean it's as I say it it sounds preposterous they're not gonna listen to any right things it's a dictatorial government but somebody's gonna make money off this contract that's what's gonna happen we have to take a quick break but when we come back we will give you an example of a conservative commentator who is dragging Khashoggi through the mud and just making things up about him we hope you're enjoying this free clip from The Young Turks if you want to get the whole show and more exclusive content while supporting independent media become a member at TYT comm slash joined today in the meantime enjoy this free segment Hey hey how you doing guys so some divergent opinions on the Washington Post story Mathemagician me thought that they should not publish it that it was profiting off his death I don't agree that he said that on Twitter eclectic miscellanea had a different idea completely different idea writing in the members section how tragically ironic that Khashoggi 'he's last piece was calling out the repressive nature of countries like Saudi Arabia remember is yes we shall a and hence my friends Argus and news outlets around the world publishing a controversial Muhammad cartoon after the attacks in Paris that the Charlie Hebdo attacks and wouldn't it be great gesture if news organizations around the world published the the last article by khashoggi to show we are all united for free speech that would be amazing I love that idea I think that's a much better idea just real quick I want to respond to mathematician look under that logic then it means any publication that has an obituary section is just profiting off of people's death I think I don't I don't see it that way I think it's important to report these things and I think that the message in Khashoggi spinal column was an incredibly important message and and it's especially important given the way he's being slandered by conservatives right now in America last comment is Gabi Morita says why do we keep calling them Saudi agents call them what they are assassins I have on several occasions call them assassins but I agree Abbey Gabi and it's Mathemagician what did I say mathematician which makes sense oh okay all right look guys let's get some votes for a show of the year this for the streamys it's gonna happen on Monday on Saturday we find out who wins new show of the year could be one of two shows us or a breakdown in the TYT Network or it could be a non Yonkers show but you guys can't vote on that one but you can't vote on show of the year and all you gotta do is tweet out hashtag TYT for streamys you could write anything you want you can write nothing if you want all you got to do is include hashtag TYT for streamys get conservatives to retweet it and it'll count as a vote as well okay so last thing for now is the Cruz I wanted to give you an update on that the ad we're running against Ted Cruz do we have the ad it's just 23 seconds I like showing it let's show it one more time this is Ted Cruz that's him phone-banking for Donald Trump after Trump called his wife ugly look at him what kind of a man does that oh yeah Trump also said his father was probably a murderer he made calls on behalf of Trump after being an unmanned by him you're looking at the saddest man in America Ted Cruz 2018 pathetic now you know what I like it more every day just like that pathetic part a lot okay so it's you whitey calm / Cruz look I leave it at 100% up to you guys and however viral it goes for how long how many ads were gonna buy I got a bunch of good news though first of all we're at what over 18 thousand dollars now so I said oh no over 19,000 dollars at ten thousand we do a Facebook ad buy and at twenty thousand we're gonna do a YouTube ad buy Wow I think that on YouTube we're gonna need about six hundred thousand ad impressions which is could be up to six hundred thousand people in Texas seeing that ad for 10,000 bucks that's a pretty good deal yeah so like the more there is the more people in Texas see that ad and the more they realize Ted Cruz 2018 pathetic Trump called his wife ugly I had a little bit of fun recording that all right and by the way if you like what we're doing you like we're home and progresses TYT DICOM /join of course and get also donated TYT calm slash slash yes alright Anna what's next alright John Miller is a White House reporter for CR T V CR T V is a conservative online streaming network of shows including Gavin McGinnis who also has a show now John Miller went out of his way to slander a journalist who was just murdered by Saudi assassins in the Saudi consulate in Turkey he's probably doing this because of the fact that it's become abundantly clear that the Trump administration is going to help cover up this death for the Saudis because of our financial ties with Saudi Arabia but more importantly because of Donald Trump's financial ties with Saudi Arabia now with that said I want to give you a sense of what Jon Miller had to say about Khashoggi on his show he said Miller referencing or referring to Istanbul as Constantinople said the media is not telling the truth about khashoggi he then derided him as a radical activist fascinating let's stop there so the least offensive part is calling Istanbul Constantinople it's silly who cares right but I do want to so I had a Greek friend in high school and we were talking about he used to call Istanbul Constantinople and he'd kid me about it and we need great relationship and then but but he said yeah like Greeks regularly do do that yeah and then I was like Constantine I'm surprising that his name was Constantine oh I was like it hasn't been Constantinople for over 500 years so can we call it the thing that the people who live there call like that's fair I'm calling it a stumble from now on okay a reasonable person does okay again not not that important what's tangent yes the important stuff is what they're saying about Khashoggi now don't as n I read you the propaganda the CR T V is putting out there and so she mentioned Gavin McGinnis a guy who calls for violence and you know white and Western pride it's so that's the kind of station C our TV is so you understand but now since then this is exactly what I expected everything that Anna's gonna read you is bouncing around the internet it has begun so now the right wing and the Magra guys have decided the Saudis dismembering people is awesome and so they will now smear the victim so so I'm gonna give you exact quotes from the show John Miller said the following we know he meaning Khashoggi had ties to the radical Islamic groups they're not reporting that we know he made calls for violence against Israel we know that he has dedicated he was dedicated to transforming Saudi Arabia into a more regressive State and maybe that's why he didn't come out of that consulate so listen three things here at a minimum for actually maybe that's why he didn't come out of the consulate in other words he had a coming they should have murdered him what that's don't that's what he's implying it's unbelievable okay number two he was pushing for a Saudi Arabia to be a more aggressive state not remotely true 100 percent the opposite of the truth in what wake it was with Saudi Arabia able to get more regressive I mean face they decapitate people I mean they will decapitate people I did it to show you did it took a shogi but more importantly I mean they have incredibly extreme laws and especially toward women if anyone is caught having an affair if a woman is even caught seen with a man who's not her husband I mean how much more regressive can you possibly get there's no freedom there are no freedom of press and and besides which khashoggi was murdered because he was fighting for to open up Saudi Arabia for liberty and for freedom and for free speech his last article published today by The Washington Post before he was killed before he had any idea was gonna be killed obviously talking about how Sattar Arabia and other Arab countries have to be open to freedom and liberty but the Republicans use freedom and liberty as a punchline so now they've flipped it on his head and and lied about his record and then point three calls for violence against Israel now I told you ahead of time I said at some point people are gonna start to say hey remember Saudi Arabia's allies with Israel who cares who they murder and behead etc so now these are code words hey remember we're on the side of Saudi Arabia and so they wanted to capitate this guy well he well he was against Israel he was against Israel well is that even true no I'm sure that he criticized the occupation as almost every single person in the Arab world has done right and as any rational person would do is occupation great are you happy about the occupation anyway and then the last part and the most important one Radek is theis of radical Islamic groups and we're gonna have more course about that but now it's easy all right he's Arab he's a Muslim let's just call him a radical I just call him a terrorist sympathizer easy and so the manga guys go yeah the guys who beheaded him are not the radical Muslims the guy who got beheaded is the radical Muslim doesn't matter he's a Muslim who cares so he continues to say khashoggi was an Islamic activist who was tight with the Muslim Brotherhood he was an extremist guys or at least I should say an extremist sympathizer because you know he didn't want to do the bombs himself okay like there's really no evidence at all to back up any of what he had to say again he was living in self-exile in the United States writing for The Washington Post because he feared for his own safety because of his criticisms of Saudi Arabia and how the Royals refused to open the country up as Jenk mentions they refused freedom of speech they refused any type of progress now the Saudi Crown Prince recently gave women the right to drive but that's a trick I mean it's a it's a good thing to allow women to drive but you have to pay attention to what he's doing in the backdrop right because that was a way of putting up a facade making it seem like he's trying to be more progressive when in reality that is not what's really happening at the same time he imprisoned the women who fought for that freedom exact that's who a bone so Salman is and the guy that these conservatives with no conscious whatsoever are defending today man there's no bottom to this barrel there's just no bottom and I don't know how anybody stays a right-winger so it's the way he would respond to I don't know if someone on the right who was targeted by Nicolas Maduro is this how he would respond if someone on the right who is a harsh critic of Maduro was murdered by Venezuelan assassins is this the way you would react to it no way of course not because your political hacks and you don't care about principle at all and a and I made a point yesterday about how when Alex Jones attacked us during a live show we're doing at the RNC he was yelling about how we like Saturday and I yelled back are you insane you've never watched this show can't stand the fundamentalist government the dictatorial government of Saudi Arabia well guess who lived up to their principles and who didn't so we're criticizing saturated Lee as any show on the planet right-wing where are you oh you're defending them funny how that turned out he also said khashoggi was a longtime friend of Osama bin Laden and wept when the al Qaeda founder was killed so let's let's clarify that statement okay khashoggi did in fact cry when Osama bin Laden was killed but not because he was Osama bin Laden's friend but because of what Osama bin Laden had become okay so khashoggi had interviewed bin Laden in Afghanistan in the 1990s when both were allied with the anti-soviet Mujahideen okay if you thought that khashoggi was wrong about that so was Reagan Reagan was the guy who armed Osama bin Laden at the time take it up with Reagan I after 9/11 however Khashoggi wrote and this is his writing these are his words Osama bin Laden's hijack planes not only attacked New York in Washington they also attacked Islam and a faith and the values of tolerance and coexistence that it preaches okay so clearly not in favor of bin Laden after the Mujahideen a fight against the Soviet Union 100% against them saying he was the exact opposite of what Islam needs to be and then the context for the tweet about crying alright so here is the full context about the crying accusation here's what Jamal khashoggi had written I collapsed crying a while ago heartbroken for you Abu Abdullah that's a nickname for bin Laden you were beautiful and brave in those beautiful days in Afghanistan before you surrendered to hatred and passion so he was saying when we were fighting the Soviets along with Ronald Reagan you were great and then you surrendered to hatred and that's why I cry for what happened to you okay funny that the Conservatives left that part out it's almost as if they want to deceive their audience they will do anything anything to protect Trump even knowing that Trump is only acting the way he is out of his own self-interests because he wants to protect his financial assets his financial relationships that's really like you're gonna go out of your way to help Trump protect himself and enrich himself what are you getting out of it because what you're getting out of it is protecting this new precedent in response to journalists who question power and authority okay and finally when you look at what these guys have done and you say well Genki that's not fair to say right-wingers in general so well then I'll apply your own principle so you say about Muslims well hey the moderate Muslims have to speak out which by the way they do after every attack every Muslim American organization puts out a statement condemning it and then they go where are they what cheaply they put out the statement you didn't read it so in this case so where are the moderate right-wingers calling out these you know abhorrent comments by other parts of the right-wing calling out CR T V calling out Donald Trump for an obvious cover-up are you guys vociferously attacking Donald Trump and criticizing him saying how dare you support that fundamentalist dick tour dictatorial government in Saudi Arabia how dare you not stand out for someone who is a Washington Post journalist who was living here in America and who was beheaded and tortured are you doing that right-wing oh no you're not huh funny funny how that works we're gonna take another quick break when we come back we'll talk about actual extremists here in the United States
