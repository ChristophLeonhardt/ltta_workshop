absolute of the portable Sun has always
been you know I grew up listening to
this story at church but it really never
really hit me until I started making
myself part of the Sun is such a
profound story and something that I
could really relate with it it's
probably one of the most intimate
passages of scripture in all the Bible
and what you have is a son who is pretty
arrogant and he says give me in my
inheritance or give me what I what I
deserve and so when he said that an
immediate Mid Eastern culture he was
basically saying I wish you were dead so
just give me the money problem child
came you know the shame that his father
they bill out in China
his dad's money what's crazy is the
father gave him the inheritance knowing
probably that the son would squander all
the wealth and then the son of course
goes off and there's this crazy life
it just takes waste all the money just
really lives in the world and ends up
finding that it's a pretty cold place
the turning point in the film is when
the Sun reaches this other sense of
hopelessness when he's got nothing left
he spent all the money and there's
nothing in this world that satisfies me
and it's when he's in this deep sense of
pain that he starts to let go of this
need for what the world tells him to
they have and so this is that part where
he knows inside that he has to make a
change for the better or a better life
or a different life and leave the one
that he's been doing behind and he said
it'd be better if he goes back home and
he goes back home broken and so you see
him totally open and obedient to respond
but what was cool was this is the father
saw his son from afar and I love the
picture of this like Mid Eastern Asian
type of dad running towards the Sun and
this says he embraces him and he kisses
him and this is the most powerful verse
today's a big word kiss is used over and
over again it's in the iterative sense
so it's like he kissed him over
and over and over and over again he's
showing this blessing disgraced his son
what this is one where I really was able
to connect it to character and as a part
of the son story is like you know one of
the most popular stories ever a lot of
people can relate to it you know we've
all been there I guess
then the Sun and the
I can relate to the world part of us and
just having that stage of rebellion and
it's not like realizing how much their
parents love them and always wanting
something else and then finding out that
that something else is not not good
anyways my parents divorced when I was a
teenager when I was about 15 and was a
result of an affair my dad had as I
hated my dad in fact I didn't want to
talk to him and I didn't for a long time
and so I kind of spiraled out of control
where I just partied and I did my own
thing so you know fast-forward so I
still had problems with my dad
you know I'd given my life to God it's
supposed to be like this now a Christian
guy that really loves God but I had this
like hatred for my father I couldn't
have this judgment against him even
though myself I I'd done crazy stupid
things I couldn't see that I just saw
his sin and so that dominated me until
one night I was walking across the
campus as a college student and I
thought I heard a voice saying you need
to love your father I said
I don't think I can because I have no
feelings for him and I thought God say
do you think my son felt like going to
the cross and then I got it I said love
is not about a feeling love is about a
commitment it's not about me liking a
person necessarily it's about me
committing myself to you
it took me about a year and a half to
make this film and I kind of wrote it
when I was a very different person than
I am today and I think the main
difference between then and now was that
I started to understand what it means to
receive grace throughout my whole life
you know I've always I've always lived
under this belief that the harder I
worked the more I'm able to achieve and
then the more happy I'm able to become
and so I worked hard I went to a great
college at Harvard University I achieved
my American dream of working at the
White House you know I was living a very
comfortable life and yet there was still
something empty about this whole thing
no matter how hard I tried to put up
this front to put up this image that
everything was all put together deep
down inside I realized I still felt like
life was still very meaningless
no matter how much harder I work but
harder I tried there was still this very
strong void in my life I felt so
depressed I felt so exhausted and I hit
the rock bottom of my life and there was
one night where I just felt completely
hopeless if we were I thought about
taking my own life
during that seasonal depression
I was diagnosed with a disease called
hepatitis B
and when I first found out about it
I was an utter shock I felt so paralyzed
by this bull misunderstanding that this
realization at the greats
Eddie Lee the great person that I
thought I was wasn't really as great as
I really was
it was in that moment of Revelation that
I started to see that my life was only
so temporary that I am weak that I am
broken
there is nothing in me that's apparently
where it made me deserves his love but
he gave it to me anyways it was only in
this moment of weakness that I start to
finally understand what the power of the
Father's love really means to us it's
the most powerful expression of love
that you can ever experience actually q
Dave I really believe that this story
that 15 isn't really about the son it's
really all about the father it's about
how loving and gracious which was to
this rebellious son interesting thing
about the story is that you know we
focus on the sun's journey and we see
his suffering you see the fact that he
becomes homeless and this is all this
money but what we don't see is that this
father is also suffering as well of
course he's a loving father
and it tears them up inside I was
watching his son
destroy himself the reason why the
father's pain is so important is that
son only realizes the father's love by
acknowledging the father's pain what a
father can give for his son in order to
teach him a life lesson we don't realize
it until later on but you know the whole
life journey is to to find ourselves
through our hardships I made a lot of
mistakes in life and it's good to know
that nobody no matter how many mistakes
you made
there's always somebody who's willing to
still accept you and forgive you
I'm lucky enough to have been given a
second chance Dylan
and what makes a story so powerful is
the reality that at the end of the day
the Sun never really did
but the father chose to love his son
need to die for a son because it's love
for
and was really a conditional expression
of love Jesus on the cross its
expression of selflessness a selfless
love s seemingly foolish
as of many but truly radical and truly
life-changing
and what we hope that people will take
away from this film is this idea that
that love is available to them and that
will worry able to experience that love
even just touch a piece of that love
your life will be forever changed
yeah I know how to take care of babies
