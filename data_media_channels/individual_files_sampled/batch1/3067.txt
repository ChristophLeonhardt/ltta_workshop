the health issue was a microcosm of the problem she always has which is she takes something relatively mundane that can be explained with transparency and turns it into a much bigger issue that sends her foes on the press into a frenzy because they feel they've been misled or deceived and so it's a very unhealthy symbiosis and you know health is a very sensitive issue for all politicians none of them really like to get into this and say what's wrong and my brother was a page a Capitol Hill page for JFK when JFK had his back operation and he tried to open the door for JFK because he was on crutches and JFK got really angry and tried to get him fired because politicians do not like to be seen as weak and especially a woman because the alt right is trying to paint her as like wheat because she's a woman and that's why they've been pushing all these conspiracies about her health but the problem is Hillary fell into a trap that's bad for her which is Pete you know she just doesn't level with people and so that's what happened again this time she didn't level with them about pneumonia which you know she has amazing stamina really I've been on book to her for two days and I'm exhausted and so it's natural that she would get sick but she just didn't admit it
