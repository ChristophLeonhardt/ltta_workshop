crane has started seizing assets belonging to the Russian energy giant Gazprom following a years-long dispute Nova gas supplies talks about that only wrong with our correspondent Leo Petrenko the contracts were in dispute etcetera etc between Ukraine and Russia what's the latest know them well it's one of these cases when you can easily say not again Russia and Ukraine could be on the brink of an all-out gas war again as you've said Kiev's begun seizing the assets of Russia's energy giant Gazprom but a few days ago gas Brom said it was scrapping all sales and transit contracts with Kiev however there is something for you to bear in mind no matter what happens in politics all the difficulties between Kiev and Moscow the ultimate reality has been that Ukraine has been relying on gas imports from Russia all along for all these years Eastern and Central Europe - and a massive share of these gas supplies is delivered through Ukraine if this Jenga tower of contracts for the purchases the transit and all the political issues to top all that off collapse says staying warm in Eastern Europe during this very cold spring as we all know kids become an issue yeah I mean even we're gonna be viewers watching this night in Britain in France et cetera except you're gonna hang on a minute a lot of our gas comes via Ukraine Oh they've been there's been a blip a couple years by an asset we said who was a blip in the past when I believe Ukraine was siphoning off some of that gas okay because Russia wants to be seen as a reliable partner doesn't it so to try and get this okay the catalyst for where we are now was a recent court verdict yeah well Ukraine's NAFTA gas and Russia's Gazprom have been settling their disputes in a Stockholm arbitration court and in the last few years there have been so many issues in between these two but just a short while ago one stockholm tribunal decision forced the Ukrainian firm to pay the Russians a of about two billion US dollars that was basically a gas bill that they hadn't paid then the latest decision was that Russia's gas prom must pay Ukraine's NAFTA gas more than 4.6 billion u.s. dollars and that was for abusing their position as monopolies and if you do the math then Moscow ends up owing Kiev more than 2.5 billion u.s. dollars and the bosses of gas from were extremely unhappy they were saying that the reasoning for that was completely unfair and that they're just bailing out a shattered economy which many times as we've seen just couldn't pay for the gas that they were buying gotcha Norbit rates has justified their decision by the sharp deterioration in the Ukrainian economy we're categorically against the cranes economic problems being solved at our expense so Russia Ukraine gas wars have happened before and it has previously led to energy crises in the region those in the West as you were saying for now they don't have to worry about anything and again it's not in any of Russia's interests to spoil this reputation has a reliable partner but previously Kiev has been caught for illegally siphoning off Russia's gas intended for Europe so there have been disruptions in gas deliveries but obviously Russia had to protect its political and economic interests and technically it wasn't gas roms fault it got you so the twists and turns continue we'll continue to follow it thanks for explaining it's complicated old picture in it
