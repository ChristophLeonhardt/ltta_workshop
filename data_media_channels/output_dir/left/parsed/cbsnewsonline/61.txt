ESTIMATES OF THE TRENDS ARE 
VERY STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT, 
AS ARE THE DEVIATIONS FROM THE 
TREND. 
I WILL SHOW YOU SOME SLIDES. 
THAT IS THE FIRST SLIDE. 
THE FIRST ONE WE ARE LOOKING AT 
IS SMALL BUSINESS OPTIMISM AND 
IT IS BASICALLY FOR PARALLEL 
CONSTRUCTION AND YOU WILL SEE 
EACH SLIDE WILL LOOK A LOT LIKE 
THIS. 
THE BLUE PART TO THE LEFT IS 
WHAT HAPPENED FROM THE 2012 
ELECTION THROUGH THE 2016 
ELECTION. 
THE DOTTED BLUE LINE IS THE 
TREND PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP 
INHERITED FROM THE PREVIOUS 
PRESIDENT AND THE RED LINE IS 
WHAT ACTUALLY HAPPENED TO THE 
DATA. 
IF YOU LOOK AT THIS CHART, YOU 
CAN SEE THE FIRST THING IS 
SMALL BUSINESS OPTIMISM AND THE 
MIDDLE CHART IS THAT NOW IT'S A 
GOOD TIME TO EXPAND ON THE LAST 
ONE IS THE PERCENT EXPECTING 
HIGHER SALES IN SIX MONTHS. 
IF YOU LOOK AT ANY OF THOSE, 
YOU WOULD SAY THAT DOESN'T 
REALLY LOOK LIKE CONTINUATION 
OF A RECENT TREND. 
NEXT SLIDE, PLEASE. 
THE NEXT CHART IS SOMETHING THAT
IN MY FIRST OPPRESSOR WAY BACK 
LAST FALL, WE TALKED A LOT 
ABOUT. 
IT'S BUSINESS INVESTMENT, MORE 
THAN $300 BILLION OVER THE 
TREND. 
IF YOU LOOK AT THE BLUE LINE ON 
THE LEFT, THE FIRST CHART IS 
NONRESIDENTIAL FIXED INVESTMENT 
AND THE DOTTED LINE IS THE 
TREND IN THE GROWTH RATE 
PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP INHERITED
IN THE MIDDLE CHART IS 
STRUCTURES OR BUILDINGS IN THAT,
AS YOU CAN SEE, THE DOTTED LINE 
IS HEADED STRAIGHTDOWN IN THE 
FINAL CHART IS EQUIPMENT 
INVESTMENT AND THAT WENT 
STRAIGHT DOWN BEFORE PRESIDENT 
DONALD TRUMP WAS SELECTED. 
ANYONE WOULD ASSERT THAT THE 
CAPITAL SPENDING BOOM THAT WE 
ARE SEEING RIGHT NOW WAS A 
CONTINUATION OF THE TREND THAT 
PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP 
INHERITED, THEN, THEY WOULDN'T 
GET A HIGH GRADE IN GRADUATE 
SCHOOL FOR THAT ASSERTION. 
THE NEXT CHART, PLEASE. 
DURABLE GOODS ORDERS AND 
CAPITAL GOODS ORDERS, A KEY 
PART OF THE ECONOMY AND ONE OF 
THE FACTORS WE LOOK AT MOST 
LOOK CLOSELY BECAUSE IT 
CHARACTERIZES, BASICALLY, THE 
GOOD PAYING JOBS, THE JOBS THAT 
AFFECT NORMAL AMERICANS, BLUE-
COLLAR AMERICANS IN THE FIRST 
CHART IS CORE CAPITAL GOODS 
ORDERS AND THE SECOND IS CORE 
CAPITAL GOODS SHIPMENTS. 
IF YOU LOOK AT IT, THE BLUE 
SHOWS A CLEAR DOWNWARD 
TRAJECTORY AND BILLIONS OF 
DOLLARS AND THE TRAJECTORY 
REVERSED ITSELF COMPLETELY WHEN 
PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP WAS 
ELECTED. 
IF YOU ASSERT THE CURRENT GOOD 
NEWS IS THE EXTENSION OF THE 
RECENT TREND, THEN YOU WOULD 
SIMPLY BE FACTUALLY INCORRECT. 
THE NEXT CHART SLIDE, PLEASE. 
HERE, WE ARE LOOKING AT THE IS 
AND PURCHASING MANAGERS INDEX, 
A SURVEY OF PEOPLE WHO ARE 
PURCHASING MANAGERS FOR 
MANUFACTURING FIRMS AND IS THE 
TITLE SUGGESTS, MANAGES 
PURCHASES. 
IT'S A GREAT INDICATOR OF THE 
ECONOMY BECAUSE YOU CAN SURVEY 
THEM AND SAY, HAVE YOU BEEN 
BUYING LOTS OF STUFF THIS MONTH 
OR HAVE YOU NOT? 
THE INDEX SHOWS WHAT THE 
RESPONSES LOOK LIKE AND YOU CAN 
SEE THE TREND ON THE PURCHASING 
MANAGERS INDEX WAS PRETTY MUCH 
FLAT WHEN PRESIDENT DONALD 
TRUMP TOOK OFFIE AND THE RED 
LINE SHOWS WHAT HAPPENED SINCE. 
THERE IS A CLEAR INFLECTION AT 
THE ELECTION AND A CLEAR BREAK 
IN TREND. 
LET'S TURN TO THE NEXT ONE. 
NOW, ONE OF THE THINGS I CAN 
REMEMBER TALKING ABOUT BEFORE I 
CAME, WAS THE FACT THAT 
ENTREPRENEURSHIP IN AMERICA WAS 
FALLING OFF AND ONE OF THE WAYS 
WE CAN MEASURE 
ENTREPRENEURSHIP, IF YOU START 
A NEW BUSINESS, YOU HAVE TO 
APPLY FOR AN I.D. 
NUMBER, A TAX I.D. 
NUMBER FOR YOUR BUSINESS. 
IN THIS CHART WE PLOTTED THE 
EIN APPLICATIONS FOR NEW 
BUSINESSES AND IF YOU LOOK AT 
THE BLUE LINE, THEY WERE HEADING
UP AT THE RECOVERY. 
BUT, THERE IS CLEAR UPWARD 
TRAJECTORY, WAY ABOVE THE TREND 
AT THE END AND SARAH, LIKE JOHN 
ROBERTS, IS A CALCULUS GEEK SHE 
LOOKED AT THAT ONE AND SAID IT 
LOOKS LIKE A VERY STRONG SECOND 
DERIVATIVE TO ME AND I SAID, I 
DIDN'T KNOW YOU DID CALCULUS 
AND SHE SAID I LIKE CALCULUS 
BETTER THAN TALKING TO THESE 
GUYS. 
 THIS CHART IS 
WORKERS REENTERING THE LABOR 
FORCE AND IF YOU LOOK AT THE 
TREND, ONE OF THE THINGS PEOPLE 
SAID WILL REPORT ALL THE GROWTH 
FORECAST IS WE WOULD HAVE 3% 
GROWTH AND WE SAID PRESIDENT 
DONALD TRUMP'S POLICIES WOULD 
BRING FACTORIES BACK TO THE 
U.S. AND GIVE CAPITAL SPENDING 
BOOM FROM THE CHART AND IT WOULD
BRING PEOPLE BACK TO THE LABOR 
FORCE AT PRECISELY THE RIGHT 
TIME. 
ONCE AGAIN, YOU CAN SEE A CLEAR 
BREAK IN THE TREND. 
IF YOU SEE A BREAK IN THE TREND 
IN THE CAPITAL SPENDING, THE 
NEW PLANT FORMATION THAT GIVES 
BLUE-COLLAR WORKERS THEIR JOBS, 
THEN, WE MAY SEE A BREAK IN THE 
TREND IN BLUE COLOR'S WORKERS 
EMPLOYMENT, AS WELL. 
THIS IS EMPLOYMENT FOR PEOPLE 
AND GOODS PRODUCING INDUSTRIES. 
IF YOU LOOK AT THE BLUE LINE ON 
THE LEFT, THERE IS A CLEAR 
DOWNWARD TREND IN THE GROWTH 
RATE OF THAT FOR PRESIDENT 
OBAMA AND A CLEAR INFLECTION 
TIME TO ALMOST PRECISELY, ONCE 
AGAIN, THE ELECTION AND THE 
NOTION THAT SOMEONE OF THE 
TREND, IT IS ALMOST LAUGHABLE 
IF YOU LOOK AT THIS CHART AND 
THEN LOOK AT THE REST OF THEM. 
SOMEBODY MIGHT SAY IF YOU ARE 
SHOWING A BUNCH OF CHARTS, 
DEPENDS ON WHEN YOU ESTIMATE 
THE TREND AND I'M SURE IF YOU 
WENT BACK AND BEGAN YOUR 
ESTIMATE OF THE CIVIL WAR AND 
THOUGHT ABOUT WHAT TREND WE 
WOULD GET, MAYBE WE WOULD GET A 
DIFFERENT ANSWER FROM WHAT WE'D 
SEE. 
ANOTHER WAY TO TEST WHETHER THE 
DATA I SHOWED YOU IS A FAIR 
REPRESENTATION OF WHAT A TREND 
LOOKS LIKE FROM WHEN PRESIDENT 
DONALD TRUMP WAS ELECTED, IS TO 
COMPARE IT TO NON-PARTISAN 
BODIES, SUCH AS MY FINAL CHART. 
I HEARD A SIGH OF RELIEF WHEN I 
SAID FINAL CHART. 
SO, IF YOU LOOK AT THE FINAL 
CHART, YOU'LL SEE THAT THE 
BLACK LINE IS IN JUNE 2017, 
WHAT THE CBO CONGRESSIONAL 
BUDGET OFFICE HAS A JOB OF 
LOOKING AT RECENT TRENDS AND 
PROJECTING IT. 
WHAT WOULD HAPPEN TO CAPITAL 
SPENDING, AND 2017, THE BLUE 
LINE IS WHAT THEY SAID IN APRIL 
2018 AND THE RED LINE IS WHAT 
ACTUALLY HAPPENED. 
I WOULD ASSERT THAT IF YOU LOOK 
AT THE COLLECTIVE BODY OF 
EVIDENCE, THE NOTION THAT WHAT 
WE SEE RIGHT NOW IS A 
CONTINUATION OF RECENT TRENDS 
IS NOT SUPER DEFENSIBLE AND I 
THINK THAT WE ARE IN A 
POLITICAL TIME AND PASSIONS ARE 
HIGH BUT AS KEY ECONOMISTS, ONE 
OF THE THINGS WE HAVE TO DO IS 
THINK ABOUT WHAT HISTORIANS 
WILL THINK WHEN THEY LOOK AT 
THIS TIME AND I PROMISE YOU 
ECONOMIC HISTORIANS WILL 100% 
EXCEPT THE FACT THAT THERE WAS 
AN INFLECTION AT THE ELECTION 
OF DONALD TRUMP AND A WHOLE 
BUNCH OF DATA ITEMS STARTED 
HEADING NORTH AND THEY WILL, OF 
COURSE, ARGUE FOR A LONG TIME 
ABOUT WHY THAT HAPPENED. 
BUT MY FINAL THOUGHT IS THIS, 
WHEN THEY DO THAT, AND WHEN YOU 
WATCH PEOPLE DO THAT IN THE 
MEDIA GOING FORWARD WITH OP-EDS 
AND SO ON, YOU SHOULD WATCH OUT 
FOR EX POST THEORIZING. 
AS AN ECONOMIST, ONE OF THE 
THINGS I CARE ABOUT IS IF 
SOMETHING HAPPENS BEFORE, YOU 
WATCH THE DATA TO SEE IF IT 
AGREES. 
THAT'S HOW YOU TEST A THEORY. 
YOU MIGHT RECALL I CAN BACK 
YOUR LAST FALL AND TOLD YOU 
THAT IF WE HAD THE TAX CUTS, 
THAT PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP 
ADVISE THAT WE HAVE, THAT HE 
PURSUED, IF WE PASS THEM THERE 
WOULD HE BE A BOOM IN CAPITAL 
SPENDING THIS YEAR. 
IN FACT, WE PROVIDED ESTIMATES 
LAST FALL THAT SAID CAPITAL 
SPENDING THIS YEAR WE GO UP 
ABOUT 11% BECAUSE OF THE TAX 
CUTS. SO FAR, AND THE FIRST 
HALF OF THE YEAR, CAPITAL 
SPENDING IS UP 10%. 
YOU DON'T HAVE TO REACH FAR FOR 
A THEORY OF WHAT HAPPENED. 
PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP 
DEREGULATED THE ECONOMY AND WE 
TALKED ABOUT THE GROWTH AND THE 
TAX CUTS HAVE HAD THE PREDICTED 
EFFECT TO BRING BUSINESSES AND 
FACTORIES BACK TO THE U.S. AND 
JOBS WERE CREATED FOR ORDINARY 
AMERICANS. 
IT'S CLEAR THERE HAS BEEN A 
TREND BREAK AND WITH THAT, I 
LOOK FORWARD TO TAKING A FEW 
QUESTIONS BEFORE A HANDED OFF 
TO SARAH TO TALK ABOUT OTHER 
THINGS. 
I WILL LET MR. ROBERTS GO 
FIRST. 
I KNOW I'M NOT ALLOWED TO GO 
FOR THE WHOLE TIME. 
>> BASED ON THE INFORMATION YOU 
GAVE US, WHERE IS THE REVENUE 
DERIVED FROM THESE INCREASING 
TRENDS MEETING THE DEFICIT LINE 
CAUSED BY TAXES? 
>> IT'S A GREAT QUESTION. 
ONE OF THE THINGS WE COULD TALK 
ABOUT -- SARAH, LET'S HAVE 
ANOTHER BRIEFING AFTER THE 
CALCULUS BRIEFING. 
LET'S DO A BRIEFING ON THE 
DEFICIT. 
ONE OF THE WAYS TO THINK ABOUT 
THIS, THERE HAS BEEN A BIG 
CHANGE IN TAX LAW AND A BIG 
CHANGE IN SPENDING POLICY. 
ON THE TAX LAW SIDE, YOU 
REMEMBER THE DYNAMICS SCORE FOR 
THE CORPORATE TAX WAS THAT IT 
WOULD HAVE A VERY, VERY LOW 
COST AND I THINK THE COST 
ESTIMATE, NOT DYNAMICALLY 
SCORED AND PROBABLY NOT, ABOUT 
$400 BILLION IN THE FINAL BILL 
OVER 10 YEARS AND CLEARLY THE 
GROWTH AND INVESTMENT BOOM 
PROJECTED BY CBO WAS A 
SIGNIFICANT UNDER ESTIMATE FOR 
WHAT HAPPENED ALREADY. 
THE NOTION THAT THE CORPORATE 
TAX SIDE HAS PAID FOR ITSELF IS 
CLEARLY IN THE DATA. 
ON THE INDIVIDUAL SIDE, ABOUT A 
$1 TRILLION COST AND $700 
BILLION WITH A REFUNDABLE CHILD 
CREDIT THAT GOT EXPANDED AT THE 
LAST MINUTE TO GET THE VOTES 
THEY NEEDED TO PASS IT. 
A REFUNDABLE CHILD CREDIT IS A 
VERY SOUND POLICY FOR PEOPLE 
WHO CARE ABOUT EQUALITY OF 
OPPORTUNITY OR FAMILIES WITH 
CHILDREN AND PRESIDENT DONALD 
TRUMP SUPPORTED HEART -- 
SUPPORTED IT WHOLEHEARTEDLY AND 
THE CHILD CREDIT IS NOT 
SOMETHING THAT WOULD EXPECT TO 
PAY FOR ITSELF. 
THE TAX CUTS HAVE INCREASED THE 
DEFICIT A LITTLE BIT, BUT NOT 
THE TAX CUTS THE DEMOCRATS ARE 
ATTACKING, BUT RATHER THAT THEY 
SHOULD HAVE SUPPORTED. 
I WILL GO TO ROAD TRIP TO. 
I'M SORRY I DON'T KNOW YOUR 
NAME. 
>> THERE'S ANOTHER THING, THE 
SPIKE IN CONSUMER PRICING, THE 
COST OF GOODS, THE INFLATION. 
THE HIGHER RATE. 
AMERICANS ARE PAYING MORE FOR 
GOODS THAN THEY DID IN RECENT 
YEARS. 
CAN YOU EXPLAIN TO WHAT EXTENT 
AMERICANS SHOULD BE CONCERNED 
ABOUT THE PRICE OF GOODS 
INCREASING AT A HIGH RATE? 
>> WELL, AMERICANS SHOULD BE 
CONCERNED THAT PRICES ARE GOING 
UP AND IF YOU LOOK AT THE 
CONSUMER PRICE INDEX OVER THE 
MOST RECENT YEAR, IT'S A LITTLE 
BIT SHORT OF 3% AND I KNOW THAT 
IS SOMETHING THAT WILL AFFECT 
AMERICANS WHEN THEY GO TO THE 
GROCERY STORE OR THE GAS 
STATION AND THEY CAN AND SHOULD 
BE CONCERNED ABOUT THAT. 
THE BEST DEFENSE AGAINST THE 
INCREASE IN INFLATION IS AN 
INCREASE IN WAGES AND THE CEA 
PUT OUT A NICE REPORT THAT IT 
CORRECTLY MEASURED REAL AFTER-
TAX WAGES GROWING ABOUT 1.4% 
THIS YEAR AND THE WAGE GROWTH 
THAT PRESIDENT TRUMP HELPED 
CREATE WITH HIS POLICIES IS 
OVERPOWERING THE INFLATION 
NUMBERS RIGHT NOW. 
I WILL GO TO ROW THREE AND THEN 
BACK. 
>> WHAT CREDIT, IF ANY, DOES 
PRESIDENT OBAMA DESERVE FOR THE 
CURRENT STATE OF THE ECONOMY? 
>> ATTRIBUTING BLAME OR CREDIT 
TO INDIVIDUALS REQUIRES THAT I 
IDENTIFY POLICIES AND TALK 
ABOUT WHAT EFFECT THIS POLICY 
OR THAT POLICY HAS AND I PREFER 
TO GIVE BLAME OR CREDIT TO 
POLICIES RATHER THAN 
INDIVIDUALS. 
PRESIDENT OBAMA, SOMETIMES ON 
THE PARTISAN TRAIL, GETS 
CRITICIZED WITH NUMBERS THAT 
ARE CLEARLY INCORRECT BECAUSE 
PEOPLE BLAME HIM FOR THE GREAT 
RECESSION THAT ALREADY STARTED 
AND THAT'S NOT FAIR. 
UP I LOOK AT PRESIDENT OBAMA'S 
POLICIES, THERE ARE A BUNCH 
THAT WERE NEGATIVE FOR GROWTH. 
THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT LIFTED 
MARGINAL TAX RATES SO MUCH SO 
THAT THE CBO EVEN SAID IT WOULD 
HAVE A NEGATIVE EFFECT ON 
GROWTH AND HE INCREASED 
MARGINAL TAX RATES ON SMALL 
BUSINESSES AND THAT'S WHY SMALL 
BUSINESS CREATION WASN'T SO 
HIGH. 
WE CAN TALK ABOUT THESE ONE BY 
ONE AND SAY THEY MAY HELP OR 
HURT GROWTH. 
HE ADVOCATED POLICIES THAT 
CLEARLY DID NOT AND I WONDER 
WHAT WAS GOING ON IN THE HEADS 
OF THE ECONOMISTS THAT TOLD 
THEM THEY WOULD, THEY DIDN'T 
HAVE MUCH EFFECT BUT TO SAY HE 
DESTROYED THE ECONOMY OR 
SOMETHING LIKE THAT, THAT IS 
NOT WHAT THEY SHOULD BE DOING. 
>> HIGH OF TWO QUESTIONS. 
CAN I TAKE THEM SEPARATELY? 
>> JUST OF THIS 
>> GO SEPARATELY. 
I WILL FORGET THE FIRST ONE. 
>> YOU TALKED ABOUT THE 
ECONOMIC NUMBERS IN THE FIRST 
WEEK IN NEARLY THREE WEEKS AND 
IT SEEMS LIKE IT MIGHT BE TIMED 
TO PRESIDENT OBAMA'S SPEECHES 
IN WHICH HE TALKED ABOUT THE 
ECONOMY AND THESE ISSUES. 
IS THAT WHY YOU'RE HERE TODAY? 
>> THANK YOU FOR ASKING THAT, 
ACTUALLY. 
'S CAN TELL YOU I'VE BEEN 
PUSHING HER TO LET ME SHOW THESE
SLIDES FOR QUITE A WHILE AND 
WE'VE UPDATED THEM FOR RECENT 
DATA. 
IN FACT, I DIDN'T KNOW ABOUT 
THE THREE-WEEK LEG. 
I THINK IT HAS SOMETHING TO DO 
WITH THE FACT THAT SENSIBLE 
PEOPLE EVEN IN THE WHITE HOUSE 
TAKE A BREAK IN AUGUST AND 
THERE ARE SOME VACATION 
TAKINGS. 
WE WERE PREPARED TO DO THIS 
BRIEFING AND IT'S NOT IN ANY 
WAY A TIMING RELATED TO 
PRESIDENT OBAMA'S FRIDAY 
REMARKS. 
AND I PROMISE TO NUMBER TWO. 
THE NEXT PERSON WILL ASK THREE, 
YOU REALIZE. 
I SHOULDN'T HAVE DONE THAT. 
>> THE PRESIDENT -- I'M CURIOUS 
ABOUT YOUR VIEWS -- HE HAS TOLD 
PRIVATE COMPANIES, APPLE AND 
AMAZON AND THE NFL HOW TO RUN 
THEIR BUSINESS. 
DO BELIEVE THAT'S APPROPRIATE 
AND STIMULATES ECONOMIC GROWTH 
FOR PRESIDENT TO BE DICTATING 
HOW PRIVATE COMPANIES RUN THEIR 
STUFF? 
>> THE PRESIDENT HAS STRONG 
OPNIONS ABOUT EVERYTHING AND 
WE WOULDN'T HAVE HAD THE 
POLICY'S SUCCESS WE'VE HAD IF 
HE HADN'T BEEN SUCH A STRONG 
ADVOCATE FOR THE THINGS WE'VE 
SEEN. 
HIS STRONG OPINIONS SOMETIMES 
STRETCH INTO AREAS THAT ARE 
OUTSIDE PLACES THAT THERE IS A 
PURVIEW AND I DON'T COUNSEL HIM 
ON THAT. 
AT A PREVIOUS PRESS RIGHT ONE 
SAID I DON'T RUN THE COUNCIL OF 
TWITTER ADVISORS AND THAT COULD 
BE TRUE FOR ALL OF MY STAY 
HERE. 
I WILL GO BACK TO THE BLUE 
SHIRT AND THE BACK. 
I SKIPPED A ROW. 
>> A QUICK QUESTION ON THE 
ECONOMIC STAFF. THE PRESIDENT 
SAID THE GDP RATE IS HIGHER 
THAN THE UNEMPLOYMENT RATE FOR 
THE FIRST TIME IN OVER 100 
YEARS. 
THAT'S JUST NOT TRUE, IS IT? 
>> I CAN TELL YOU WHAT IS TRUE. 
THE HISTORY OF THOUGHT [ 
LAUGHTER ] LET ME SAY THE 
HISTORY OF THOUGHT OF HOW 
ERRORS HAPPEN IS NOT SOMETHING 
THAT I CAN ENGAGE IN BECAUSE 
FROM THE INITIAL FACT TO WHAT 
THE PRESIDENT SAID, THAT I 
DON'T KNOW THE WHOLE CHAIN OF 
COMMAND, BUT WHAT IS TRUE IS IT 
IS THE HIGHEST IN 10 YEARS AND 
AT SOME POINT, SOMEBODY 
PROBABLY CONVEYED IT TO HIM, 
ADDING A ZERO AND THEY 
SHOULDN'T HAVE DONE THAT. 
AT LEAST THE NUMBERS AT THE 
WHITE HOUSE -- WHEN THE PRESS 
FINDS MISTAKES, WE DON'T LIKE 
MAKING THEM BUT WE ARE GRATEFUL 
TO HAVE THEM POINTED OUT 
BECAUSE WE WANT TO CORRECT 
THEM. 
YOU MIGHT HAVE NOTICED I GAVE 
SARAH BAD NUMBER AND IT WAS MY 
FAULT AND WE APOLOGIZED. 
YOU'D HAVE TO TALK TO THE 
PRESIDENT ABOUT WHERE THE 
NUMBER CAME FROM BUT THE 
CORRECT NUMBER IS 10 YEARS. 
>> FORMER PRESIDENT OBAMA SAID 
PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP WOULD 
NEED A MAGIC WAND TO GET TO 4% 
GDP AND THE PRESIDENT SUGGESTED 
THAT WAS A DIRECT QUOTE. 
DID PRESIDENT OBAMA EVER SAY 
THAT? 
>> I DON'T KNOW. 
I'M NOT THE CHAIRMAN OF COUNCIL 
OF TWITTER ADVISORS. 
>> THE WHITE HOUSE PUT OUT A 
NUMBER THAT USES A DIFFERENT 
WAY OF CALCULATING GROWTH. 
IT SEEMS LIKE THAT IS 
UNFORTUNATE BECAUSE YOU GET 
APPLES AND ORANGES COMPARISONS. 
WHY IS IT IMPORTANT TO DO THAT 
WITH NEW CALCULATIONS THAT WERE 
NOT CASH BENEFITS LIKE VACATION 
TIMES AND OTHER TYPES OF 
BENEFITS. 
WHY IS THAT MIDSTREAM AND YOU 
DON'T BASE YOUR ANALYSIS ON 
THAT FROM THE PAST? 
>> THANKS FOR THE QUESTION. 
WE HAVE A REPORT THAT CAME OUT 
LAST WEEK AND THERE WERE A LOT 
OF STORIES THAT I THOUGHT WERE 
WELL DONE AND THOUGHTFUL ABOUT 
THE PEACE. 
THE QUESTION FOR AMERICANS AND 
WHAT THEY WANT TO KNOW, HOW ARE 
PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP'S 
POLICIES AFFECTING THEIR LIVES? 
IT TURNS OUT THE STATISTIC THAT 
GOT THE MOST ATTENTION IN THE 
MEDIA IS NOT VERY REASONABLE 
FOR ANSWERING THAT QUESTION AND 
WE TALKED ABOUT HOW TO BETTER 
MEASURE THAT. 
IT WAS NOT A CRITICISM OF THE 
BUREAU OF LABOR STATISTICS. 
WE LOVE THAT AND WE ARE DATA 
GEEKS AND WE WANT TO COME UP TO 
A BETTER MEASURE TO ACCOUNT FOR 
THE FACT THAT PEOPLE GET 
BENEFITS AND IT WOULD ACCOUNT 
FOR THE FACT THAT PEOPLE JUST 
HEAD TAX CUTS AND A BETTER 
MEASURE WILL ACCOUNT FOR THE 
FACT THAT THE COMPOSITION OF 
THE LABOR FORCE IS CHANGING 
BECAUSE SO MANY ARE COMING IN 
AND THE PEOPLE THAT HAVE BEEN 
OUT FOR WHILE TEND TO BE LOWER 
SKILLED AND BRING DOWN AVERAGES 
IF YOU DON'T CONTROL FOR THAT. 
WE SHOW THAT JUST AS IS 
CONSISTENT WITH THE 4.2 GDT -- 
4.2% GDP GROWTH, THERE IS A 
MASSIVE AMOUNT OF GROWTH 
COMPARED TO THE PROJECTIONS 
WHEN PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP 
TOOK OFFICE. 
I DON'T SEE SARAH TELLING ME TO 
STOP. 
SHOULD I KEEP GOING? 
I'VE BEEN RIGHT HANDED AND I 
APOLOGIZE. 
>> HOW IMPORTANT IS IT FOR YOU 
TO HAVE A NEW NORTH AMERICAN 
FREE TRADE AGREEMENT INCLUDING 
CHINA? 
>> THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION 
AND THE FIRST THING BEFORE I 
TURN TO THE TRADE PART OF THE 
QUESTION IS THAT SOME PEOPLE 
HAVE SAID THE ECONOMY IS 
STRONG, BUT THAT IS A SUGAR 
HIGH. 
IT'S NOT A SUGAR HIGH BECAUSE 
THE CAPITAL SPENDING BUT WE 
PROMISE THAT WOULD HAPPEN IF WE 
PASSED THE TAX CUTS IS UNDER 
WAY. 
THE COOL THING ABOUT CAPITAL 
SPENDING IS THAT PEOPLE BUILD 
FACTORIES AND THAT IS WHAT 
CAPITAL SPENDING IS AND THEY DO 
IT IN THE FIRST HALF OF THE 
YEAR. 
IT'S UP 10% AND THE SECOND 
HALF, THE FACTORIES PRODUCE 
OUTPU AND YOU GET MORE OUTPUT. 
THE IDEA THAT THE TREND MIGHT 
NOT CONTINUE AND IT IS A SUGAR 
HIGH IS NOT CONSISTENT WITH THE 
FORM THE GROWTH IS TAKING. 
FOR NAFTA, THE TEAM HAS BEEN IN 
NEGOTIATIONS WITH CANADA AND 
MAY CONTINUE TO BE HOPEFUL THEY 
WILL SIGN ON TO THE 21ST 
CENTURY DEAL WITH MEXICO, A 
BETTER DEAL FOR AMERICAN 
WORKERS AND THEY SHOULD SIGN ON 
TO THAT. 
I WILL GO BACK TO YOU. 
>> I HAVE A QUESTION ABOUT THE 
INCREMENT INEQUALITY. 
CAN YOU TALK ABOUT THE INCOME 
INEQUALITY STREAM AND ARE YOU 
CONCERNED ABOUT WHETHER PEOPLE 
WHO ARE POOR, NOT PEOPLE IN THE 
COUNTY, BUT PEOPLE BEYOND THE 
POVERTY LINE, ARE THEY BEING 
HELPED BY THE ECONOMY? 
>> IF YOU THINK ABOUT IT, THE 
NEW ENTRANTS THAT GET A JOB, 
THEY GO FROM HAVING ZERO WAGE 
TO HAVING A WAGE BUT THEY WON'T 
NECESSARILY SHOW UP IN THE WAGE 
STATISTICS AND THEY ARE BETTER 
OFF. 
THERE ARE OTHER WAYS THEY ARE 
BETTER OFF BECAUSE OF THE 
GROWTH IN THE ECONOMY AND 
POLICIES THAT HAVE GIVEN 
RESOURCES TO FAMILIES THAT ARE 
KNEE-DEEP. 
AT THE CDA, WE PUT OUT A 
DIFFERENT REPORT ON WHAT IS 
GOING ON WITH PROPERTY 
CORRECTLY MEASURED. 
THERE IS IMPORTANT DATA COMING 
OUT THIS WEEK THAT WILL HELP 
LOOK HOW INCOME INEQUALITY HAS 
CHANGED THIS YEAR AND OVER THE 
PREVIOUS YEAR. 
MY EXPECTATION IS THAT THE DATA 
WILL START TO TURN AND THIS 
YEAR WE WILL SEE A DECLINE IN 
INCOME INEQUALITY BECAUSE BLUE-
COLLAR WAGES ARE STARTING TO 
GROW. 
IT IS A FINAL POINT AND 
IMPORTANT THAT YOU BRING THIS 
UP AND I WANT TO EMPHASIZE THAT 
BECAUSE I CARE SO MUCH ABOUT 
IT. 
THE FACT IS, WE ARE AT A 
HISTORIC MOMENT BECAUSE WE ARE 
DEEP INTO A RECOVERY. 
THE UNEMPLOYMENT RATE IS REALLY 
LOW AND WE'VE CREATED A CAPITAL 
SPENDING BOOM. 
NORMALLY, IF YOU DON'T HAVE A 
CAPITAL SPENDING BOOM, PEOPLE 
START TO BID UP THE WAGES, BUT 
THEY ARE DOING IT BECAUSE THERE 
IS A SHORTAGE OF LABOR. 
WHAT'S HAPPENING NOW, THEY ARE 
BIDDING UP WAGES BECAUSE PEOPLE 
HAVE BETTER MACHINES TO WORK 
WITH AND THEIR PRODUCTIVITY IS 
GOING UP AND THAT MEANS THE 
RECOVERY CAN LAST LONGER AND 
THAT IS REALLY, REALLY GOOD FOR 
WORKERS AT THE LOW-END. 
AT THIS MOMENT IN ECONOMIC 
HISTORY, IF YOU LOOK AT THE 
PAST ECONOMIC BOOMS, INCOME 
EQUALITY DECLINE. 
IF WE WERE TO BLOW IT AND HAVE A
RECESSION BECAUSE OF BAD 
POLICY, WE WOULD LOSE AN 
ENORMOUS OPPORTUNITY ON INCOME 
INEQUALITY. 
IT'S THE LAST QUESTION. 
>>> THE ACTIVITY'S FORWARD-
LOOKING. 
AND IF YOU WANT TO MODEL THIS, 
YOU HAVE EXPECTATIONS NOT JUST 
ABOUT THIS MONTH, BUT THE NEXT 
FIVE, SIX, SEVEN, EIGHT, NINE, 
10 COMING YEARS. 
THE MOMENT PRESIDENT DONALD 
TRUMP WAS ELECTED, IN EQUITY 
MARKETS AND SURVEYS, PEOPLE 
RATCHETED UP EXPECTATIONS FOR 
WHAT WOULD HAPPEN TO THE 
ECONOMY. 
PERHAPS EVERYBODY BUT CLINTON 
SUPPORTERS WERE DOING THAT 
AFTER THE ELECTION AND THE FACT 
IS, THE EXPECTATIONS TURNED OUT 
TO BE RATIONAL BECAUSE THE 
TURNAROUND THEY EXPECTED IS 
SOMETHING WE SEE IN THE DATA. 
LET ME HANDED BACK TO SARAH AND 
I WILL CLOSE BY SAYING THAT 
ANYONE WHO WANTS TO FOLLOW UP 
AND TALK ABOUT THE DATA, AND 
YOU CAN TELL I LIKE TO DO THAT, 
FEEL FREE TO REACH OUT TO 
CONNECT WITH ME OVER AT THE 
CEO. 
>>> THANK YOU, KEVIN. 
A COUPLE OF ANNOUNCEMENTS AND 
UPDATES AND THEN I WILL TAKE 
HER QUESTIONS. 
LAST WEEK, THE SENATE JUDICIARY 
COMMITTEE UNDER CHAIRMAN 
GRASSLEY CONDUCTED A THOROUGH 
AND TRANSPARENT WEEK OF 
HEARINGS ALLOWING EACH SENATOR 
AMPLE TIME TO THOROUGHLY REVIEW 
THE NOMINATION OF JUDGE BRETT 
KAVANAUGH. 
UNFORTUNATELY, MANY COMMITTEE 
DEMOCRATS AND PROTESTERS 
ATTEMPTED TO TURN THE HEARING 
INTO A CIRCUS. 
NONETHELESS, JUDGE KAVANAUGH 
DEMONSTRATED EXACTLY WHERE 
PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP NOMINATED
HIM. 
HE SHOWED RESPECT FOR THE 
CONSTITUTION, IMPECCABLE 
QUALIFICATIONS AND EXTRAORDINARY
TEMPERAMENT. 
JUDGE KEVIN EIDE REINFORCE THE 
BEDROCK PRINCIPLES OF JUDICIAL 
INDEPENDENCE AND THE RULE OF LAW
AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO THE 
JUDICIARY COMMITTEE COMPLETING 
THE REVIEW AND ADVANCING HIS 
NOMINATION. 
ANOTHER MATTER BY PHONE AND ALSO
TOMORROW IN PERSON AT THE WHITE 
HOUSE, PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP 
IS SCHEDULED TO RECEIVE A 
BRIEFING FROM DHS SECRETARY 
NIELSEN AND FEMA ADMINISTRATOR 
LONG. 
THE LATEST BRIEFING AS PART OF 
THE MONITORING OF MULTIPLE 
STORMS THAT ARE PREDICTED TO 
AFFECT THE U.S. IN THE COMING 
DAYS. 
THE WHITE HOUSE HAS BEEN IN 
CONTACT WITH GOVERNOR'S OFFICES 
AND LOCAL AUTHORITIES IN GUAM, 
THE NORTHERN MARIANA ISLANDS, 
PUERTO RICO, THE U.S. VIRGIN 
ISLANDS, HAWAII, GEORGIA, 
FLORIDA, SOUTH CAROLINA, NORTH 
CAROLINA, VIRGINIA, WEST 
VIRGINIA, PENNSYLVANIA, NEW 
JERSEY AND NEW YORK JUST SENT 
SATURDAY MORNING. 
LINES OF COMMUNICATION ARE OPEN 
AND THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT 
STANDS READY TO ASSIST. 
THESE TROPICAL STORMS AND 
HURRICANES ARE VERY DANGEROUS 
AND WE ENCOURAGE ANYONE IN THE 
PATH TO HEED THE WARNINGS OF 
OFFICIALS WHO HAVE THE EXPERTISE
AND KNOWLEDGE OF THE 
COMMUNITIES TO PROVIDE THE BEST 
ON GROUND INFORMATION. 
LASTLY, WE EXTEND DEEPEST 
CONDOLENCES TO THE FAMILY OF 
SECRET SERVICE AGENT COLLIN 
JOHNSON. 
AGENT JOHNSON HAS SERVED HIS 
COUNTRY HONORABLY AS A MARINE 
AND THEN THE SECRET SERVICE. 
MANY OF YOU KNOW HIM. 
HE WAS LARGER THAN LIFE, 
LITERALLY, A GREAT FRIEND, 
FATHER, HUSBAND AND MEMBER OF 
THE U.S. SECRET SERVICE. 
THE MEN AND WOMEN AMONG THE 
SECRET SERVICE ARE AMONG THE 
MOST HONORABLE AND DEDICATED 
PUBLIC SERVANTS YOU CAN FIND 
ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD AND HE 
WAS AMONG THE VERY BEST. 
HE WAS ASSIGNED TO CHIEF OF 
STAFF JOHN KELLY AND THERE TO 
HELP ANYONE WHO NEEDED IT. 
OUR HEARTS ARE BROKEN AND AGENT 
JOHNSON WILL BE GREATLY MIST 
AND HE WILL BE -- WE EXTEND OUR 
PRAYERS TO THE FAMILY. 
>> THE PRESIDENT SAID ON FRIDAY 
HE THOUGHT IT WOULD BE A GOOD 
IDEA FOR JEFF SESSIONS TO LOOK 
INTO THE ANONYMOUS OP-ED. 
IS THERE ANYTHING WRITTEN THAT 
WOULD WARRANT AN INVESTIGATION 
BY THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE? 
>> CERTAINLY IF THERE IS AN 
INDIVIDUAL, WHETHER OR NOT 
SINCE WE DON'T KNOW WHO THEY 
ARE, IF THAT INDIVIDUAL IS IN 
MEETINGS THAT WERE NATIONAL 
SECURITY WAS DISCUSSED OR OTHER 
IMPORTANT TOPICS AND THEY ARE 
ATTEMPTING TO UNDERMINE THE 
EXECUTIVE BRANCH, THAT WOULD 
CERTAINLY BE PROBLEMATIC AND 
SOMETHING THE DEPARTMENT OF 
JUSTICE SHOULD LOOK INTO. 
>> THE MISUSE OF CLASSIFIED 
INFORMATION, WHAT REALM WOULD 
THAT FALLEN? 
>> IT IS FOR THEM TO MAKE THAT 
DETERMINATION. 
>> A QUICK FOLLOW-UP. 
IS THE WHITE HOUSE ACTIVELY 
TRYING TO FIND OUT WHO THIS 
PERSON IS OR DO YOU NOT REALLY 
CARE AND ARE MOVING ONTO OTHER 
THINGS? 
>> WE ARE FOCUSING ON THINGS 
THAT ACTUALLY MATTER AND A STAFF
THAT IS HERE TO DO THEIR JOB 
AND NOT UNDERMINE THE GREAT 
WORK THIS PRESIDENT AND THIS 
ADMINISTRATION HAS DONE. 
WE WILL CONTINUE FOCUSING ON 
THAT AND FRANKLY, IT'S SAD AND 
PATHETIC THAT A GUTLESS 
ANONYMOUS SOURCE COULD RECEIVE 
SO MUCH ATTENTION FROM THE 
MEDIA. 
I THINK THE AMERICAN PEOPLE 
WILL BE MUCH BETTER SERVED IF 
WE ACTUALLY SPENT TIME TALKING 
ABOUT SOME OF THE REALLY 
IMPORTANT THINGS THAT ARE 
FACING OUR COUNTRY AND THINGS 
THIS ADMINISTRATION IS DOING TO 
HELP FIX THEM. 
JUSTIN? 
>> HAS THE PRESIDENT RECEIVED A 
LETTER FROM THE STATE 
DEPARTMENT AND CAN YOU SHARE 
DETAILS ABOUT THE CONTENT AND 
TONE OR ANY COMMITMENTS OR 
REQUESTS? 
>> THE PRESIDENT HAS RECEIVED A 
LETTER FROM KIM JONG-UN. IT WAS 
A VERY WARM AND POSITIVE LETTER 
AND WE WILL RELEASE THE FULL 
LETTER UNLESS THE NORTH KOREAN 
LEADER AGREES THAT WE SHOULD. 
THE PRIMARY PURPOSE OF THE 
LETTER WAS TO REQUEST AND LOOK 
TO SCHEDULE ANOTHER MEETING 
WITH THE PRESIDENT, WHICH WE 
ARE OPEN TO AND ARE ALREADY IN 
THE PROCESS OF COORDINATING 
BED. 
THE RECENT PARADE IN NORTH 
KOREA, FOR ONCE, WAS NOT ABOUT 
THE NUCLEAR ARSENAL AND THE 
PRESIDENT HAS ACHIEVED 
TREMENDOUS SUCCESS WITH HIS 
POLICY, SO FAR AND THIS IS 
FURTHER EVIDENCE OF PROGRESS IN 
THAT RELATIONSHIP AND THERE ARE 
A NUMBER OF THINGS THAT HAVE 
TAKEN PLACE. 
REMAINS HAVE COME BACK AND 
HOSTAGES HAVE RETURNED AND 
THERE'S NO TESTING OF MISSILES 
AND NUCLEAR MATERIAL AND OF 
COURSE, THE HISTORIC SUMMIT 
BETWEEN THE LEADERS. 
THIS LETTER IS FURTHER 
INDICATION OF THE PROGRESS WE 
OPE TO CONTINUE TO MAKE. 
>> THE MEETING WOULD BE IN 
WASHINGTON? 
>> WE WILL LET YOU KNOW WHEN WE 
HAVE FURTHER DETAILS. 
IT'S CERTAINLY SOMETHING WE 
WANT TO TAKE PLACE AND WE ARE 
ALREADY WORKING TO MAKE THAT 
HAPPEN. 
>> TO FOLLOW-UP, YOU MENTION 
REMAINS BEING RETURNED AND 
HOSTAGES AND THE LACK OF 
TESTING, ALL HAPPENING WHEN THE 
PRESIDENT CITED A LACK OF 
PROGRESS AND CANCELED SECRETARY 
POMPEO'S TRIP. 
OTHER THAN THESE REALLY NICE 
WORDS FROM KIM JONG-UN AND THE 
PARADE, WHAT SIGNS OF PROGRESS 
WARRANT THIS NEW OPTIMISM FROM 
PRESIDENT TRUMP? 
>> AGAIN, CERTAINLY THE MOST 
RECENT PARADE THIS WEEKEND, ONE 
OF THE FIRST TIMES, I BELIEVE, 
WE HAVE HAD A PARADE THAT WASN'T
HIGHLIGHTING THE NUCLEAR 
ARSENAL AND WE CONSIDER THAT A 
SIGN OF GOOD FAITH. 
AGAIN, THE LETTER FROM KIM JONG-
UN TO THE PRESIDENT CERTAINLY 
SHOWS A COMMITMENT TO CONTINUING
CONVERSATIONS AND CONTINUING TO 
WORK ON THE PROGRESS THEY HAVE 
HAD SINCE THEIR MEETING JUST A 
FEW MONTHS AGO AND ALSO, A 
CONTINUED COMMITMENT TO FOCUS ON
DENUCLEARIZATION OF THE 
PENINSULA. 
>> A QUESTION ON BOB WOODWARD. 
PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP CONTINUES
TO CALL HIM A LIAR AND SAYS HIS 
BOOK IS COMPLETELY FICTION. 
HE ALSO MENTIONED LIBEL LAWS 
QUITE A BIT. 
IS PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP 
CONSIDERING FILING A LAWSUIT 
AGAINST WOODWARD? 
>> WE WILL CERTAINLY KEEP YOU 
POSTED. 
WE'VE BEEN EXTREMELY CLEAR FROM 
THE BEGINNING AND MANY OF THE 
SOURCES HAVE ALREADY SPOKEN OUT 
TO REFUTE A COUPLE OF THEM. 
CHIEF OF STAFF JOHN KELLY 
AGGRESSIVELY PUSHED BACK AND 
GENERAL MATTERS AGGRESSIVELY 
PUSHED BACK ON THE CLAIMS AND 
JOHN DOWD IS ALSO PUSHING BACK 
AGAINST THE THINGS ATTRIBUTED 
TO HIM AND A NUMBER OF PEOPLE 
HAVE COME OUT TO SAY THAT 
WOODWARD NEVER EVEN REACHED OUT 
TO CORROBORATE STATEMENTS 
ATTRIBUTED TO THEM. 
IT SEEMS INCREDIBLY RECKLESS 
FOR A BOOK TO MAKE SUCH 
OUTRAGEOUS CLAIMS AND TO NOT 
EVEN TAKE THE TIME TO GET A $10 
FACT CHECKER TO CALL AROUND AND 
VERIFY THE QUOTES WERE 
HAPPENING. 
NO EFFORT WAS MADE AND IT SEEMS 
LIKE A CARELESS AND RECKLESS 
WAY TO WRITE A BOOK. 
JOHN? 
>> THE PRESIDENT SAID HE WAS 
LOOKING WHETHER HE SHOULD TAKE 
ACTION FOR THE WRITER OF THE 
ANONYMOUS OP-ED. 
DOES HE NOT THINK THAT IS 
PROTECTED BY THE FIRST 
AMENDMENT? 
DOES HE REALLY THINK THE 
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT SHOULD 
CONTEMPLATE ACTION AGAINST A 
NEWSPAPER FOR PUBLISHING AN 
ARTICLE? 
>> IT'S LESS ABOUT THAT PART OF 
IT AND WHETHER OR NOT SOMEBODY 
WAS ACTIVELY TRYING TO 
UNDERMINE THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH 
OF THE GOVERNMENT AND A DULY 
ELECTED PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED 
STATES. 
THEY DON'T WANT TO BE PART OF 
THAT PROCESS, THEY SHOULDN'T BE 
HERE. 
>> HE TWEETED EARLIER AND IT'S 
BEEN A WILD SINCE WE'VE TALKED 
TO YOU, SO THIS GOES BACK A 
LITTLE WHILE. 
HE TWEETED LAST WEEK SUGGESTING 
THAT THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT 
SHOULD NOT BE INVESTIGATING, 
SHOULD NOT BE PROSECUTING THE 
TWO REPUBLICAN CONGRESSMEN 
BECAUSE IT MIGHT HURT REPUBLICAN
CHANCES IN NOVEMBER. 
IS THE PRESIDENT REALLY TRYING 
TO SUGGEST OR OUTRIGHT SAYING 
THAT THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT 
SHOULDN'T BE INVESTIGATING OR 
PROSECUTING ALLIES OF THE 
PRESIDENT IF IT MIGHT HURT THE 
POLITICAL CHANCES OF THE PARTY? 
>> CERTAINLY, THE PRESIDENT 
THINKS NO ONE IS ABOVE THE LAW. 
WHAT HE WOULD LIKE TO SEE IS A 
FAIR PLAYING FIELD AND THAT 
THERE ALSO HAVE BEEN A NUMBER 
OF CONCERNS RAISED ABOUT 
INDIVIDUALS IN THE FBI AND THE 
DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE THAT HAVE 
BEEN IGNORED AND WE LIKE TO SEE 
THOSE LOOKED AT, AS WELL. 
>> THEY DON'T WANT TO GO 
FORWARD BECAUSE THEY ARE 
ALLIES? 
>> I CAN'T WEIGH-IN ON AN 
ACTIVE INVESTIGATION BUT I CAN 
TELL YOU THE PRESIDENT DOESN'T 
THINK ANYBODY IS ABOVE THE LAW 
AND WE ARE SIMPLY STATING THERE 
SHOULD BE CAUSE FOR CONCERN OF 
A NUMBER OF THINGS THAT HAVE 
HAPPENED IN THE DEPARTMENT OF 
JUSTICE AND THE FBI AND WE'D 
LIKE TO SEE THOSE LOOKED AT, AS 
WELL. 
>> HOW SOON WOULD YOU LIKE TO 
HAVE THIS SECOND MEETING? 
>> I DON'T HAVE SPECIFICS ON 
THE EXACT TIMING. 
AS THESE MEETINGS TAKE PLACE 
NOW AND AS WE HAVE MORE 
DETAILS, I WILL CERTAINLY LET 
YOU KNOW. 
>> CAN YOU UPDATE US ON WHERE 
THE TRADE TALKS STAND? 
>> WE CONTINUE TO HAVE ONGOING 
CONVERSATIONS WITH THE 
CANADIANS AND ARE HOPEFUL WE 
WILL COME TO AN AGREEMENT WITH 
THEM. 
JEFF? 
>> SARAH, DOES THE PRESENT 
BELIEVE THE DENIALS HAVE BEEN 
COMING IN FOR THE TOP ADVISORS 
OR IT DOES HE BELIEVE IT IS 
SOMEONE FROM WITHIN? 
DOES HE BELIEVE THAT LIE 
DETECTOR TEST SHOULD BE ISSUED 
AS THE VICE PRESIDENT 
VOLUNTEERED TO DO ON SUNDAY? 
>> NO LIE DETECTORS ARE BEING 
USED OR TALKED ABOUT. 
OR, LOOKED AT AS A POSSIBILITY. 
FRANKLY, THE WHITE HOUSE AND 
STAFF ARE FOCUSED ON DOING OUR 
JOBS AND TRYING TO SHOW UP 
EVERY DAY AND DO WHAT WE CAN TO 
HELP BETTER THE AMERICAN 
PEOPLE, NOT DEAL WITH COWARDS 
THAT REFUSED TO PUT THEIR NAMES 
IN AN ANONYMOUS LETTER. 
>> HE TWEETED SOMETHING ON 
FRIDAY AFTER GEORGE 
PAPADOPOULOS WAS SENTENCED TO 
1428 DAYS -- TO 14 DAYS IN 
PRISON. 
WHAT WAS HE TALKING ABOUT WITH 
$28 MILLION? 
>> I'D HAVE TO GO BACK AND 
CHECK ON THAT. 
I DIDN'T LOOK AT THAT. 
>> IS AT THE PRICE TAG OF THE 
RUSSIAN INVESTIGATION? 
IF SO, IT'S HIGHLY INFLATED. 
>> I'D HAVE TO CHECK ON THAT. 
>> WILL HE TESTIFY? 
>> THAT IS A MATTER FOR OUTSIDE 
COUNSEL. 
>> WHAT DOES HE PLAN TO SAY AND 
WHAT DOES HE HOPE TO ACCOMPLISH 
WITH THIS 911 ADDRESS? 
>> CERTAINLY THE FOCUS WILL BE 
ON REMEMBERING THAT HORRIFIC DAY
AND REMEMBERING THE LIVES THAT 
WERE LOST IN CERTAINLY HONORING 
THE INDIVIDUALS WHO WERE NOT 
ONLY LAWS THAT DAY BUT ALSO PUT 
THEIR LIVES ON THE LINE TO HELP 
IN THAT PROCESS. 
HE WILL BE THERE AND THE VICE 
PRESIDENT WILL BE IN 
WASHINGTON, D.C. AT THE 
PENTAGON. 
>> SARAH, THANK YOU. 
I'M ASSUMING YOU'VE READ BOB 
WOODWARD'S BOOK. I 
KNOW A LOT OF US HAVE. 
AND WE EXPECT, OTHER THAN 
REPEATING DENIALS FROM MATTIS 
AND KELLY AND JOHN DOWD, CAN WE 
EXPECT THE WHITE HOUSE TO GIVE 
US A LIST OF ALL THE THINGS 
THAT ARE WRONG AND NOT QUALIFY 
WOODWARD TO BE A LIAR? 
>> THAT WOULD BE A COMPLETE AND 
UTTER WASTE OF OUR TIME. 
SO, NO. 
>> HOLD ON A SECOND. 
IT SAYS 55% OF AMERICANS 
BELIEVE THE OP-ED WRITER OF THE 
TIMES IS RIGHT AND THE 
PRESIDENT IS GETTING A 60% 
NEGATIVE RATING ON THE HONEST 
AND TRUTHFUL. 
60% OF AMERICANS THINK HE IS A 
DISHONEST PERSON. 
BECAUSE THE PRESIDENT THINK HE 
COULD WIN A CREDIBILITY BATTLE 
WITH BOB WOODWARD? 
HE IS A MEMBER OF THE PRESS 
CORPS AND HELPED TAKE RICHARD 
NIXON DOWN AND IS A LEGEND. 
HOW COULD HE WOULD NOT 
CREDIBILITY BATTLE? 
>> ONCE AGAIN, I WOULD 
CERTAINLY RATHER TAKE THE 
ACTUAL ON RECORD ACCOUNT FROM 
PEOPLE WHO ARE HERE AND HAVE 
BEEN WORKING IN THIS BUILDING 
AND HAVE INTERACTED WITH THE 
PRESIDENT DAY IN AND DAY OUT 
LIKE GENERAL MEDICINE GENERAL 
KELLY AND LIKE MYSELF, NOT 
DISGRUNTLED FORMER EMPLOYEES 
THAT REFUSED TO PUT THEIR NAME 
ON THINGS WHEN THEY COME OUT TO 
ATTACK THE PRESIDENT. 
I THINK THOSE ARE FAR MORE 
CREDIBLE SOURCES AND CERTAINLY 
FAR MORE RELIABLE VOICES WITHIN 
THIS ADMINISTRATION AND THEY 
CAN ACCURATELY TELL WHAT HAS 
TAKEN PLACE IN THE BUILDING. 
>> IS THE PRESIDENT A CREDIBLE 
VOICE? 
>> ABSOLUTELY. 
JOHN? 
>> YOU SAID THE PRESIDENT HAS 
SAID A LOT ABOUT THE 
PUBLICATION OF THIS OP-ED AND 
YOU'VE CALLED IT IN THE 
PRESIDENT HAS CALLED IT A 
BETRAYAL AND YOU'VE CALLED IT 
AN ACT OF DISLOYALTY. 
THE PRESIDENT HAS BEEN MENTIONED
QUITE A FEW TIMES, EVEN IN THIS 
BRIEFING, AND HAS CALLED ON THE 
DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE TO 
INVESTIGATE THE PUBLICATION OF 
THIS OP-ED. 
THERE IS NO VIOLATION OF THE 
CRIMINAL CODE THAT GOES ALONG 
WITH THE PUBLICATION OF THIS OP-
ED. 
I'M A LITTLE CURIOUS AS TO WHAT 
IT IS THE PRESIDENT BELIEVES 
MAY HAVE BEEN VIOLATED IN THE 
BOOK AS RELATES TO THE 
PUBLICATION OF THIS OP-ED 
PIECE? 
>> ONCE AGAIN, WE CONSIDER 
SOMEBODY ACTIVELY TRYING TO 
UNDERMINE THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH 
OF OUR GOVERNMENT INAPPROPRIATE 
AND SOME THINGS TO CAUSE 
CONCERN AND THEY SHOULD TAKE A 
LOOK AT IT. 
>> WHAT WAS THE VIOLATION? 
>> IT GIVES A GREAT LEVEL OF 
CONCERN AND THEY SHOULD LOOK 
INTO IT. 
>> I'M CONCERNED. 
IT'S NOT A VIOLATION OF LAW. 
>> I'M NOT AN ATTORNEY. 
IT'S FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF 
JUSTICE TO MAKE THAT 
DETERMINATION WE ARE ASKING 
THEM TO LOOK INTO IT AND MAKE 
THAT DETERMINATION AND THEY 
CERTAINLY ARE FULLY CAPABLE OF 
DOING THAT. 
SOMEBODY ACTIVELY TRYING TO 
UNDERMINE THE DULY ELECTED 
PRESIDENT OF THE ENTIRE 
EXECUTIVE BRANCH OF GOVERNMENT 
SEEMS PROBLEMATIC TO ME AND 
SOMETHING THEY SHOULD TAKE A 
LOOK AT. 
>> THANK YOU, SARAH. 
JUST TO SPECIFY THIS A BIT, IS 
THE WHITE HOUSE TREATING THE 
ANONYMOUS OP-ED WRITER AS A 
FULL-FLEDGED BREACH OF SECURITY 
MATTER? 
IS THE FBI INVESTIGATING BOTH 
STAFF AND THE MEANS OF 
COMMUNICATIONS? 
CELL PHONES AND COMPUTERS AND 
THE LIKE? 
>> I'M NOT AWARE OF THAT LEVEL. 
THAT WOULD BE SOMETHING I WOULD 
BE PART OF. 
CERTAINLY, AS I JUST TOLD YOUR 
COLLIE, WE THINK THERE IS A 
CONCERN HERE AND IT SHOULD BE 
LOOKED INTO. 
>> ONE OF THE QUESTION. 
OBVIOUSLY, THE WHOLE WORLD 
WATCHED WHEN THE FRONT RUNNING 
BRAZILIAN PRESIDENTIAL 
CANDIDATE WAS STABBED LAST 
EEK. 
HAS THE PRESIDENT CALLED OR 
SENT A STATEMENT TO HIS FAMILY? 
>> I'M NOT AWARE THAT THE 
PRESIDENT HAS BUT I DO BELIEVE 
MEMBERS OF THE ADMINISTRATION 
HAVE REACHED OUT AND I WILL 
WORK TO GET YOU THE SPECIFICS 
OF WHO THAT WAS. 
DAVID? 
>> WHAT DOES THE PRESIDENT MAKE 
OF THIS TALK OF THE 25TH 
AMENDMENT AND SOME OF WHAT HE 
HEARS ON MEDIA OUTLETS 
REGARDING THE WORD CRAZY TALK? 
IT SEEMS LIKE THERE'S A LOT OF 
TALK ABOUT THAT ON MANY OF THE 
MAINSTREAM MEDIA OUTLETS. 
>> I THINK WE WOULD SAY THAT 
IT'S ABOUT AS RIDICULOUS AS 
MOST OF BOB WOODWARD'S BOOK. 
THE FACT THAT THAT IS ACTUALLY 
BEING HONESTLY DISCUSSED IS 
RIDICULOUS AND FRANKLY, 
INSULTING TO THE NEARLY 62 
MILLION PEOPLE THAT CAME OUT 
AND OVERWHELMINGLY SUPPORTED 
THIS PRESIDENT HAD VOTED FOR 
HIM AND SUPPORTED HIS AGENDA 
AND ARE WATCHING AND CHEERING 
ON AS HE SUCCESSFULLY 
IMPLEMENTS THAT AGENDA EVERY 
SINGLE DAY. 
>> CAN YOU GIVE US A SENSE AS 
TO WHAT DOCUMENTS THE PRESIDENT 
IS CONSIDERING FOR 
DECLASSIFICATION IN THE NEXT 
TWO WEEKS? 
WHEN, EXACTLY, CAN WE EXPECT 
THEM? 
>> WHEN WE HAVE SPECIFICS ON 
THAT, WE WILL LET YOU KNOW. 
>> CAN YOU GIVE US A SENSE OF 
WHAT THE DOCUMENTS ARE? 
>> I CAN'T SAY RIGHT NOW. 
WE WILL LET YOU KNOW. 
>> I WANT TO ASK ABOUT THE 
MIDDLE EAST PEACE PROCESS. 
THE PALESTINIAN MISSION IS 
CLOSED IN WASHINGTON AND THE 
AMBASSADOR TO THE U.S. ACCUSES 
THIS COUNTRY OF MURDERING THE 
PEACE PROCESS AND UNDERMINING 
ITS ROLE IN THE PEACE PROCESS. 
THE STATE DEPARTMENT SAID IT IS 
NOT RETREATING FROM THE EFFORTS 
TO ACHIEVE A LASTING AND 
COMPREHENSIVE PEACE AND THAT IS 
THE PROCESS? 
>> WE'VE BEEN VERY UPFRONT 
THROUGHOUT THE PROCESS AND THE 
FACT THAT WE WANT TO SEE PEACE 
AND WE WANT TO HAVE THOSE 
CONVERSATIONS AND WE WANT TO 
HELP BROKER THAT DEAL AND WE 
ARE GOING TO CONTINUE PUSHING 
FORWARD. 
BEYOND THAT, I DON'T HAVE 
ANYTHING SPECIFIC ON IT TODAY. 
>> THE U.S. CAN NO LONGER BE 
INVOLVED AND IS THAT NOT THE 
CASE? 
>> CERTAINLY, WE HAVE A GREAT 
DEAL OF SUPPORT WITH OUR FRIEND 
AND ALLY IN ISRAEL BUT WE ARE 
AS COMMITTED TODAY AS WE'VE 
EVER BEEN TO THE PEACE PROCESS. 
>> ON FRIDAY, THE PRESIDENT 
TALKED ABOUT A TRADE DEAL WITH 
INDIA. 
>> I KNOW THAT A NUMBER OF 
ADMINISTRATION OFFICIALS 
RECENTLY CAME BACK FROM INDIA 
AND EXPRESSED THEIR WILLINGNESS 
TO NEGOTIATE NEW AND BETTER 
TRADE DEALS AND THOSE 
CONVERSATIONS ARE AT THE 
BEGINNING STAGES. 
WE WILL KEEP YOU POSTED FURTHER 
IN THE PROCESS. 
>> I WANT TO FOLLOW UP ON 
STEVEN'S QUESTION ON THE PEACE 
PROCESS. 
YOU SAY THE DOOR IS OPENED AND 
YOU ARE WORKING ON IT. 
IS IT REALISTIC FOR THE 
PRESIDENT TO BELIEVE YOU CAN 
ACTUALLY ACHIEVE PEACE IN THE 
MIDDLE EAST IN HIS FIRST TERM 
IN OFFICE, AS HIS PROMISE TO 
DO? 
THE ADMINISTRATION HAS TAKEN 
STEPS THAT PALESTINIANS HAVE 
SAID DO NOT HELP. 
>> AGAIN, CERTAINLY WE ARE VERY 
MUCH COMMITTED TO THE PROCESS 
AND ARE HOPEFUL WE CAN GET 
THERE. 
>> JOHN BOLTON SAID THE 
ADMINISTRATION WOULD SANCTION 
AND IN THE REPORT THAT SEEMS TO 
BE AN AVERSION TO PUSH THE 
POLICIES, IS IT FAIR TO SAY THE 
ADMINISTRATION IS SHIFTING TO A 
MORE HARD-LINE STANCE TO THE 
ICC? 
WHY IS THE USO CONCERN? 
>> CERTAINLY, THE PRESIDENT IS 
COMMITTED TO DEFENDING THE 
NATIONAL SOVEREIGNTY AND THE 
SECURITY INTERESTS INCLUDING 
USING ANY MEANS NECESSARY TO 
PROTECT OUR CITIZENS, THOSE OF 
OUR ALLIES FROM UNJUST 
PROSECUTION BY THE ICC. 
THE ANNOUNCEMENT THAT THEY 
WOULD CONSIDER AN INVESTIGATION 
INTO U.S. SOLDIERS IN 
AFGHANISTAN IS A THREAT TO 
AMERICAN SOVEREIGNTY AND IF 
THEY PROCEED WITH THAT, THE 
U.S. WOULD CONSIDER THOSE 
OPTIONS THAT AMBASSADOR BOLTON 
LAID OUT TODAY. 
>> IF THE ICC IS, IN FACT DEAD 
TO YOU, AS JOHN BOLTON SAID 
TODAY, WHAT IS THE CONCERN THAT 
THE U.S. HAS? 
>> THEY TOLD US THEY WERE ON 
THE VERGE OF MAKING THAT 
DECISION AND WE ARE LETTING 
THEM KNOW OUR POSITION AHEAD OF 
MAKING THAT DECISION. 
I WILL TAKE ONE LAST QUESTION. 
DAVID? 
>> THE EDITOR OF THE GLOBAL 
TIMES, IN BEIJING, THE PREMIER 
FOREIGN POLICY OUTLET, WROTE ON 
TWITTER THAT THE PRESIDENT 
BLAMES CHINA ON NORTH KOREA, 
QUITE A BIT. 
NOW THAT THERE SEEMS TO BE 
IMPROVEMENT IN THE NORTH KOREAN 
STANCE, DOES CHINA DESERVE SOME 
CREDIT? 
HE SUGGESTED THEY DO. 
WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT THAT? 
>> I THINK THE PRESIDENT 
DESERVES THE CREDIT IN THIS 
PROCESS. 
HE HAS BEEN THE LEAD VOICE AND 
THE ONE THAT PUT THE INITIAL 
PRESSURE ON NORTH KOREA. 
CERTAINLY, THE PRESIDENT HAS 
VERY PUBLICLY EXPRESSED HIS 
GRATITUDE TOWARD PRESIDENT Xi 
FOR THE ROLE THAT THEY PLAYED 
AND HE WOULD HAVE LIKED TO SEE 
THEM CONTINUE TO STEP UP AND DO 
MORE. 
FRANKLY, WOULD STILL LIKE TO 
SEE THEM STEP UP AND DO MORE. 
THE CREDIT IN THE PROCESS AT 
THIS POINT AND WHERE WE ARE, I 
WOULD SAY, BELONGS TO PRESIDENT 
TRUMP AND WE WILL CONTINUE TO 
HOPEFULLY WORK WITH PRESIDENT 
Xi AND HIS TERM AND 
ADMINISTRATION TO MAKE 
PROGRESS. 
>> GIVEN A SECOND MEETING, IT 
SOUND LIKE WITH KIM JONG-UN, 
DOES THE PRESIDENT BELIEVE THAT 
HE HAS TO NEGOTIATE ALMOST 
PERSONALLY WITH KIM JONG-UN, 
GIVEN THAT THINGS MAY GO POORLY 
AND THAT HAVE TO RESCHEDULE 
ANOTHER MEETING? 
>> I WOULDN'T SAY IT'S GONE 
POORLY CONSIDERING STEPS HAVE 
BEEN TAKEN BY THE NORTH KOREANS 
TO SHOW SIGNS OF GOOD FAITH. 
>> PROGRESS? 
>> OTHER STEPS HAVE BEEN TAKEN 
AND IT WOULDN'T SAY IT'S GONE 
POORLY. 
AT THE END OF THE DAY, 
ULTIMATELY, IT IS BEST WHEN YOU 
CAN HAVE THE TWO LEADERS SIT 
DOWN. 
PARTICULARLY, FROM THE NORTH 
KOREAN SIDE. 
WE KNOW MOST OF THE DECISIONS 
WILL HAVE TO BE RUN THROUGH KIM 
JONG-UN AND CERTAINLY HE WILL 
WANT TO TALK TO HIS COUNTERPART 
IN PRESIDENT TRUMP AND WE THINK 
IT'S IMPORTANT AND WE ARE GLAD 
WE ARE MAKING PROGRESS. 
THANKS SO MUCH, GUYS. 
HAVE A GREAT DAY. 
>> WE'VE BEEN WATCHING THE 
WHITE HOUSE PRESS BRIEFING FOR 
ABOUT A HALF-HOUR. 
THE FIRST ONE IN NEARLY THREE 
WEEKS AND IT STARTED WITH AN 
ECONOMIC MESSAGE. 
KEVIN HASSETT, THE ECONOMIC 
ADVISERS, SHOWED A SERIES OF 
CHARTS THAT ATTEMPTED TO MAKE 
THE CASE THAT IT ISN'T A 
CONTINUATION OF THE GROWTH 
STARTED IN THE OBAMA YEARS BUT 
A TRUMP SPECIFIC TREND THAT THE 
ECONOMY IS SHOWING. 
HE DID FESS UP TO THE PRESIDENT 
MAKING A MISTAKE IN A TWEET 
EARLIER THIS MORNING. 
IT'S NOT 100 YEARS SINCE GDP IS 
BETTER THAN THE UNEMPLOYMENT 
RATE, JUST 10, HE CONCEDED. 
HE DIDN'T KNOW HOW THE 
PRESIDENT GOT THE WRONG NUMBER 
AND THEN SARAH HUCKABEE SANDERS 
MADE SOME NEWS. 
SHE INDICATED THE PRESIDENT HAS 
RECEIVED A LETTER FROM NORTH 
KOREAN LEADER, KIM JONG OWN. 
A WARM, POSITIVE LETTER IN HER 
DESCRIPTION, THOUGH SHE 
WOULDN'T GO INTO DETAILS. 
SHE SAID IT MAINLY FOCUSED ON 
THE NORTH KOREAN INTEREST IN 
HAVING ANOTHER FACE-TO-FACE 
MEETING WITH PRESIDENT DONALD 
TRUMP AND THERE WERE QUESTIONS, 
OF COURSE, ABOUT THE ANONYMOUS 
OP-ED PUBLISHED BY THE NEW YORK 
TIMES AND THE WHITE HOUSE AND 
ITS EFFORT TO FIND OUT WHO 
WROTE THE OP-ED. 
SHE SUGGESTED THE DEPARTMENT OF 
JUSTICE SHOULD LOOK INTO WEATHER
THE AUTHOR, IF THEY ARE 
RECEIVING CLASSIFIED BRIEFINGS, 
IS IMPROPERLY DOING SO, GIVEN 
THE AUTHOR'S CONCERNS ABOUT 
WHAT IS GOING ON IN THE WHITE 
HOUSE. 
SHE SAID THEY ARE MORE 
INTERESTED IN THINGS THAT ARE 
ACTUALLY IMPORTANT. 
WEIJIA JIANG WAS IN THE FRONT 
ROW AND ASKED A COUPLE OF 
QUESTIONS OF HUCKABEE SANDERS. 
WHEN THERE IS A CONTROVERSY, 
THIS WHITE HOUSE DISTRACTS WITH 
ANOTHER CONTROVERSY. 
THEY ALMOST ARE SEEM TO BE 
DISTRACTING WITH WE ARE GOING 
TO SAY WE WILL DEMONSTRATE OUR 
COMPETENCE. 
WHAT IS YOUR READ ON THE 
MESSAGE THEY ARE TRYING TO 
DRIVE TODAY? 
>> Reporter: I BELIEVE YOUR 
QUESTION WAS ABOUT WEATHER THE 
ADMINISTRATION IS TRYING TO 
DISTRACT FROM THE DISTRACTIONS 
BY ROLLING OUT THIS ECONOMIC 
BRIEFING. 
HE WAS ASKED SPECIFICALLY ABOUT 
THAT. 
THE CHAIRMAN OF THE COUNCIL OF 
ECONOMIC ADVISERS ASKED IF IT 
WAS IN DIRECT RESPONSE TO WHAT 
PRESIDENT OBAMA SAID OVER THE 
WEEKEND. 
REMEMBER, THE ECONOMIC GROWTH 
STARTED UNDER MY 
ADMINISTRATION, HE SAID. 
HE SAID THE ECONOMIC NUMBERS 
WERE IN THE WORKS FOR WEEKS AND 
CERTAINLY THIS IS NOT A DIRECT 
RESPONSE TO ANYTHING BAD 
PRESIDENT OBAMA SAID. 
BUT, IN TERMS OF WHETHER IT WAS 
MEANT TO BE A DISTRACTION FROM 
THE MAIN STORY LINES, YOU KNOW, 
IT CERTAINLY WASN'T. 
AS SOON AS SARAH HUCKABEE 
SANDERS TOOK THE PODIUM, SHE 
WAS SLAMMED WITH QUESTIONS THAT 
WE HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO ASK. 
CERTAINLY, SINCE BOB WOODWARD'S 
EXCERPTS FROM HIS BOOK CAME OUT 
AND SINCE A NEW YORK TIMES OP-
ED. 
IN FACT, WE HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE 
TO SPEAK TO SARAH HUCKABEE 
SANDERS FOR NEARLY THREE WEEKS 
AND THOSE QUESTIONS CERTAINLY 
DOMINATED THE HEADLINES AND SHE 
WAS PREPARED FOR THEM. 
SHE CONTINUED TO REGURGITATE 
THE SAME MESSAGE, THE SAME 
OFFICIAL WORD FROM THE 
ADMINISTRATION THAT WE'VE HEARD 
IN OTHER WAYS. 
WHETHER FROM PRESIDENT DONALD 
TRUMP OR FROM OTHER SENIOR 
OFFICIALS WHO HAVE COME OUT AND 
REALLY TRIED TO CHANGE THE 
NARRATIVE FROM BOTH THE 
WOODWARD BOOK AND THE NEW YORK 
TIMES OP-ED. 
>> SPEAKING OF THE OP-ED, THE 
WHITE HOUSE SEEMS TO BE 
INTERESTED IN DISCREDITING 
AND/OR OUTING THE PERSON WHO 
WROTE IT AND ALSO INTERESTED IN 
MOVING FORWARD. 
HUCKABEE SANDERS WAS ASKED 
SPECIFICALLY WHETHER THEY WOULD 
SUGGEST A WHITE HOUSE STAFFER 
TO A LIE DETECTOR. 
WHAT POSITION DOES THE WHITE 
HOUSE SEEM TO BE TAKING ON 
MOVING FORWARD ON THAT? 
>> Reporter: SANDERS BRUSHED 
OFF THE IDEA THAT LIE DETECTORS 
COULD BE PART OF SCREENING 
ADMINISTRATION OFFICIALS FOR 
THEIR PART IN LEAKING 
INFORMATION, EVEN THOUGH IT WAS 
BROUGHT UP BY VICE PRESIDENT 
MIKE PENCE, WHO SAID HE WOULD 
AGREE TO A LIE DETECTOR TEST. 
SHE ALMOST LAUGHED IT OFF AND 
SAID THAT IS NOT IN THE WORKS 
AND THEY ARE NOT TALKING ABOUT 
THAT AND IT WOULD BE A PROTOCOL 
HERE. 
YOU ARE RIGHT. 
SHE DID NOT DENY THAT THE 
PRESIDENT, HIMSELF, IS FIXATED 
WITH THE IDEA OF FINDING OUT 
WHO THIS PERSON IS AND THAT'S 
WHAT WE'VE SEEN FROM THE VERY 
BEGINNING. 
IT'S THE OBSESSION THAT HAS BEEN
TO FIND OUT WHO THE PERSON IS 
AND TO PENALIZE THEM, SOMEHOW, 
RATHER THAN FOCUSING ON THE 
CONTENT OF WHAT THE AUTHOR 
WROTE. 
THAT CONTINUES TO BE THE CASE 
BECAUSE SANDERS SAID, HE OR SHE 
IS A POTENTIAL THREAT TO 
NATIONAL SECURITY. 
I HEARD YOU MENTION THAT SHE 
ALSO SAID THAT PERHAPS THE 
DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE SHOULD 
LOOK INTO THIS BUT SHE WAS NOT 
ABLE TO ANSWER THE CRITICAL 
QUESTION. 
THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE HAS A 
VERY SPECIFIC FUNCTION, TO 
INVESTIGATE FEDERAL CRIMES AND 
SHE WAS ASKED MULTIPLE TIMES, 
WHAT IS THE CRIME THAT THE 
WRITER COMMITTED BY EXPRESSING 
THEIR VIEWS AND BY EXERCISING 
FIRST AMENDMENT RIGHTS? 
SHE WAS NOT ABLE TO SAY WHAT 
LAW THE AUTHOR VIOLATED, IF 
ANY. 
SHE SAID, YOU KNOW, I'M NOT A 
LAWYER BUT I THINK THE 
DEPARTMENT OUGHT TO LOOK INTO 
THIS. 
THEY STILL HAVEN'T GOTTEN TO 
THE HEART OF THAT QUESTION AND 
THIS COULD BE A MIST 
OPPORTUNITY BY THE DEPARTMENT 
OF JUSTICE. 
INSTEAD OF COMING OUT TO SAY, 
YOU KNOW, WHAT WE DO IS 
INVESTIGATE CRIMES AND WE DO 
NOT SEE EXACTLY WHAT CRIME 
WOULD BE INVESTIGATED HERE, THEY
ISSUED A STATEMENT LAST WEEK 
SAYING WE DO NOT DENY OR 
CONFIRM THE EXISTENC OF ANY 
INVESTIGATIONS. 
>> SANDERS WAS ABLE TO POINT TO 
WHAT SHE DESCRIBED AS GOOD NEWS 
AND NORTH KOREAN NEGOTIATIONS. 
WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT THAT? 
>> Reporter: SOME NEWS OUT OF 
THAT. 
SHE TOLD US THAT KIM JONG-UN 
SENT A LETTER TO PRESIDENT 
DONALD TRUMP AND IT WAS 
RECEIVED AND IN THAT LETTER, 
EXPRESSED POSITIVE MESSAGE 
ABOUT A SECOND MEETING. 
SHE SAID THEY ARE WORKING ON 
NEGOTIATIONS TO BROKER A SECOND 
MEETING. 
OF COURSE, NO DETAILS ABOUT 
WHERE IT MIGHT BE A. I ASKED HER
WHY THE PRESIDENT SEEMS TO HAVE 
COMPLETELY SHIFTED HIS TONE AND 
REVERTED BACK TO OPTIMISM SINCE 
JUST TWO WEEKS AGO. 
YOU REMEMBER HE CANCELED A TRIP 
THAT SECRETARY POMPEO WAS 
SUPPOSED TO MAKE TO NORTH KOREA 
AND IT WOULD HAVE BEEN HIS 
FOURTH TRIP TO TALK ABOUT WHERE 
PLANTS STAND FOR 
DENUCLEARIZATION. 
PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP, 
HIMSELF, CITED A LACK OF 
PROGRESS AND CANCELED THE TRIP. 
WHEN YOU LOOK AT WHAT HAS 
HAPPENED BETWEEN THEN AND NOW, 
HERE'S WHAT HAPPENED. 
KIM JONG-UN HAS SAID A LOT OF 
REALLY NICE THINGS ABOUT 
PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP AND HELD 
A PARADE THAT DID NOT SHOWCASE 
INTERCONTINENTAL BALLISTIC 
MISSILES, AS PREVIOUS PARADES 
DID AND HE SENT A LETTER TO 
PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP THAT 
INCLUDED THESE VERY NICE WORDS 
AND POSITIVE REINFORCEMENT. 
WHAT IS LACKING IS ANY SORT OF 
CONCRETE PLAN OR ANY KIND OF 
DETAILS ABOUT WHAT KIM JONG-UN 
PLANS TO DO TO TAKE THAT STEP 
TOWARD DENUCLEARIZATION. 
APPARENTLY, THOSE NICE WORDS 
AND THE PARADE WAS ENOUGH TO 
CHANGE HIS MIND AND CHANGE HIS 
TONE BECAUSE WE'VE SEEN ON 
TWITTER THAT HE IS VERY 
ENTHUSIASTIC ABOUT THE THINGS 
KIM HAS SAID AND DONE IN TERMS 
OF THAT PARADE. 
AGAIN, NO DETAILS ABOUT WHAT HE 
PLANS TO DO TO GET RID OF HIS 
NUCLEAR WEAPONS. 
>> WE'VE SEEN THAT TONE GO BACK 
AND FORTH SEVERAL TIMES. 
WEIJIA JIANG AT THE WHITE 
HOUSE, THANKS SO MUCH. 
>>> A LOT MORE NEWS AHEAD. 
YOU ARE STREAMING CBSN. 
STICK WITH US.
