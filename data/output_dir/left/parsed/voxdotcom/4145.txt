there was a bizarre controversy
yesterday that went all the way up to
President Barack Obama about whether you
should put peas in guacamole this girl
came from New York Times recipe the
internet erupted in outraged by the idea
that you might possibly do this ever
tried peas in your guacamole
we don't do peas and walk alone on this
sorry I'm gonna be the weirdest
breakfast ever
that's for sure
100% yeah that's turbo and there's a
sauna
mr. polar that's turbo I yeah
hey Chipotle too much does not know that
also you should know I love peas we
should just I thought the whole blogging
peace thing look gross so come in with
different projects like avocado or
smooth like p.m. you're double-dipping
it I'm not I turned it around
double dip here today that's the V one
really I think so maybe not I can't talk
you'll be a little embarrassing if we're
totally wrong if I confidently asserted
this is peace solidarity Allison solar
energy I think this is B's yes yes bean
our bed yeah I don't know the picture
they tweeted head hold beet hold these
in it which i think is what everyone
freaked out what was different about
that recipe is not the piece at all the
peas make the recipe a little bit
greener but they don't add much taste to
it there's a very faint toothpaste
apiece what really you taste in that
recipe is they boil a jalapeno and a
broiled jalapeno is a much stronger
flavor than a couple of blended peas
I don't know actually if I like the New
York Times recipe or not but if I don't
it's not because of the piece
