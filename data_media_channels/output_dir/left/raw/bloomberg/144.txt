1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,860
I’m a certified broadcast meteorologist

2
00:00:03,860 --> 00:00:07,780
I’m the only person in Phoenix that has that seal

3
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:12,600
I’m very scientific when it comes to everything.
Everything in life.

4
00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:14,520
And, my hairsprays is one of them.

5
00:00:15,849 --> 00:00:17,580
I have at least four different kinds.

6
00:00:17,590 --> 00:00:21,280
I’m like thinking about the chemistry of
them and what they do

7
00:00:21,280 --> 00:00:22,480
Should be okay

8
00:00:27,220 --> 00:00:27,820
Oh we did?

9
00:00:29,040 --> 00:00:30,440
92 right?

10
00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:32,640
Oh geez, I’m going to come retweet you.

11
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:37,440
That’s ridiculous.

12
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:42,500
We hit 92°F (33°C). We tied the record.

13
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:47,660
92°F degrees, our first 90s of the year and
it was enough to tie the record that dates

14
00:00:47,660 --> 00:00:51,110
all the way back to 1972, and old one for us, tied today

15
00:00:51,110 --> 00:00:52,670
More records are in jeopardy

16
00:00:52,670 --> 00:00:54,390
Abundant sunshine again tomorrow

17
00:00:54,390 --> 00:00:58,370
About 16°F degrees above normal, 
so well ahead of schedule for that

18
00:00:58,370 --> 00:01:03,010
You know you sit here and you forecast day
after day after day and you start noticing

19
00:01:03,010 --> 00:01:04,010
This is weird

20
00:01:04,010 --> 00:01:05,188
This is different

21
00:01:05,188 --> 00:01:07,560
We are getting hotter and hotter

22
00:01:12,620 --> 00:01:16,229
And now it’s just it’s too hot to ignore,
we can’t ignore these trends and pretend

23
00:01:16,229 --> 00:01:17,229
they’re not happening.

24
00:01:17,229 --> 00:01:18,280
Busting that previous record

25
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:20,229
Breaking that 2004 record

26
00:01:20,229 --> 00:01:21,729
It’s about to get even hotter

27
00:01:21,729 --> 00:01:27,020
By 2100, 76 days possible at 110°F (43°C) or hotter

28
00:01:27,020 --> 00:01:29,580
each year. That’s over two months

29
00:01:29,580 --> 00:01:33,789
For a lot of people, they can’t name one
scientist that they know personally, but they

30
00:01:33,789 --> 00:01:35,860
know their local weather person.

31
00:01:35,860 --> 00:01:40,029
Across the state temperatures unseasonably
warm everywhere you look...

32
00:01:40,029 --> 00:01:47,179
I’m the only access to a scientist that
many of these people will ever get, because

33
00:01:47,180 --> 00:01:50,200
I’m in their homes every night on their
television and they watch me

34
00:01:52,670 --> 00:01:56,820
Historically Arizona has been a very red state.

35
00:01:56,829 --> 00:02:01,599
I have been the only one, and my meteorologists
that I work with here on staff to present

36
00:02:01,599 --> 00:02:03,289
climate stuff on the air.

37
00:02:03,289 --> 00:02:05,860
There are no other stations in Phoenix that do it

38
00:02:08,060 --> 00:02:09,820
Our normal high today: 76 degrees

39
00:02:09,820 --> 00:02:10,919
Well, we’re doing better than that.

40
00:02:10,919 --> 00:02:15,900
We'll see 88 today but the 90s come in to stay starting tomorrow

41
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:17,480
I love it.

42
00:02:18,260 --> 00:02:22,240
When I first started doing this, I said the
words “climate change” a lot.

43
00:02:22,300 --> 00:02:24,120
I was really gung-ho about it

44
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:26,060
I’m gonna talk about climate change

45
00:02:26,060 --> 00:02:26,860
I’m gonna say climate change

46
00:02:26,860 --> 00:02:29,760
I don’t care if they don’t like it, I’m
gonna, basically, hit them with the truth!

47
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:33,260
Today the American Meterological Society sent a letter to the [Environmental Protection Agency's] Scott Pruitt

48
00:02:33,260 --> 00:02:34,760
saying he’s wrong to think that carbon dioxide

49
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:37,860
is not the main cause of global warming.

50
00:02:37,860 --> 00:02:41,700
The letter said in reality the world’s seven
billion people are causing climate to change

51
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:43,400
and our emissions of carbon dioxide...

52
00:02:45,020 --> 00:02:46,180
Might get some emails on that one.

53
00:03:06,580 --> 00:03:10,360
I do try to respond if I see stuff like that, but you know

54
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:12,260
I just move on, keep going.

55
00:03:12,260 --> 00:03:13,840
Keep going

56
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:19,600
Senior Producer: 
Alright Amber, what have you got for us today?

57
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:26,380
Phoenix fasting warming season is spring and
since the 1970s our average spring temperatures

58
00:03:26,380 --> 00:03:29,640
have climbed nearly four degrees Fahrenheit.

59
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:33,760
Producer: What is the counterargument to people
who say that climate isn’t changing.

60
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:40,120
If you actually look at the trend of carbon
dioxide being released they’re very well correlated.

61
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:46,260
Luke’s not a believer.

62
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:50,080
Who opened it?

63
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:53,700
No we always have haters.

64
00:03:54,780 --> 00:03:56,520
Again we don’t have say climate change,
global warming, we don’t have to say any

65
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:58,740
of those things, we just have to say

66
00:03:58,740 --> 00:04:02,180
this is just, this is going to be our new normal – right?

67
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:06,960
Spring is actually Arizona’s fastest warming season

68
00:04:06,980 --> 00:04:11,320
Average spring temperatures are now are nearly four degrees warmer than they were in the 1970s

69
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:16,660
When I would say the words “global warming”
or “climate change” it would be a trigger

70
00:04:16,660 --> 00:04:19,760
for a half or more of my audience

71
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:22,480
to just tune out and not listen to the science anymore

72
00:04:25,580 --> 00:04:31,480
So you remove those two words, and you just
talk about how they’re going to be affected

73
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:37,800
as things change, and they’re much more
open to listening.

74
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:40,080
Well chocolate and champagne, two of our favorite

75
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:41,620
Valentine’s Day things

76
00:04:41,620 --> 00:04:43,520
But the future of these two loves may be in trouble

77
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:48,240
Rising temperatures, changing rainfall patterns
they’re already affecting

78
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:49,700
the areas that they grow in

79
00:04:49,700 --> 00:04:54,620
That’s the secret weapon, that’s how you
get people to care about this

80
00:04:56,780 --> 00:05:01,280
It’s important for me to share what I know 
about science

81
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:04,440
because people need to know what to expect.

82
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:09,660
It’s a hot and dry place but if it gets
hotter and drier, we’re going to have issues

83
00:05:09,660 --> 00:05:13,400
with this place being habitable

84
00:05:13,400 --> 00:00:00,000
We’re going to be in trouble.
