“The image that I want of this country
is an immigration system
that secures our borders
and upholds our humanitarian ideals.
Congress needs to fix it.”
That’s Homeland Security
Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen.
She’s trying to deflect criticism
aimed at the Trump administration
for separating families who crossed
the U.S.-Mexico border illegally.
Critics say it’s a
heartless tactic.
Nielsen has tried to
argue that they’re simply
following the law.
It’s not the first time that
she’s been in the cross hairs.
She was close to
resigning in May
after Trump berated her
at a cabinet meeting
because he thought she
wasn’t adequately securing
the nation’s borders.
“Good afternoon.”
In a press briefing soon after,
Sarah Huckabee Sanders
was asked about
Nielsen’s rumored desire
to resign.
“Does the president have confidence
in Secretary Nielsen?”
“As we’ve said
many times before,
if the president no longer
has confidence in a
cabinet member, he’ll let you know.”
So how did Nielsen get here?
She joined the newly formed
Transportation Security Administration
after 9/11 and devised
national response plans
for things like
terrorist incidents
and extreme weather events.
Fast forward to the
Trump administration.
She worked under
John Kelly when
he headed homeland security.
And then again, when he
moved to the White House
to be chief of staff.
Nielsen was known was the
as the gatekeeper
to the gatekeeper,
a no-nonsense policy wonk
who helped instill discipline
in the chaotic West Wing.
Nielsen‘s November
confirmation hearing
to take over D.H.S.
was mostly deferential,
but there were some bumps.
“I believe in reuniting
children with their families.
If their families are not
here — ”
“Then are you saying you
would deport those
children to reunite them
with their families
who have actually
put those children in a
process of fleeing violence,
and they want those children
to be safe and in the United States?”
“Well, in that case,
I would certainly
want to work with you
to understand more
about the implications.”
“Thank you.”
That’s an issue she’s back 
to dealing with today,
though now she’s
less conciliatory.
“Here is the bottom line.
D.H.S. is no longer
ignoring the law.
We are enforcing the laws
as they exist on the books.
As long as illegal entry
remains a criminal offense,
D.H.S. will not look
the other way.”
