govenor women thank you very much for joining us on the show pleasure I know you've been following the Prewitt headlines as they've been coming out so I will ask you simply if when you were a PA administrator would you have expected to keep your job if you did what Scott Pruett did no not past the first minute I mean the ethical tone deafness of this man is just unbelievable and it's costing us taxpayers hundreds of thousands of dollars and people have got to start getting upset about it I Scott Pruitt CPA makes the argument that hey this is all legit right he's got security concerns when he talked about the Italy Travel Pruett said he was attending important meetings at the g7 right he had an obligation to participate and Nanni said he was dumbfounded by all the attention it generated should he have been dumbfounded well he shouldn't have been just given the previous trips that he's taken I mean for instance when he went to Morocco there was no good reason particularly that I have seen for him to have been there just wasn't a piays purview to be promoting various forms of energy if they weren't just clean but he was talking about liquefied natural gas as I understand it so that didn't make any sense the trip to Italy and meeting with the g7 sure you do that but you don't eat and five-star restaurants at least I never did but talk about that because is he making a credible argument that yes he had to travel whole point to the EPA will point to pass administrators like yourself and others who did do travel you got to go around the world and take some of these meetings is that not a fair argument yeah absolutely that is a fair argument but you do it where you have EPA business if you're meeting with the other ministers for the environment that's absolutely appropriate if you're going to look at things where EPA is funding projects again that's appropriate but you don't go and take extra side trips just because you want to take extra side trips while you're there have you spoken with Scott Pruett at any point did he call you before getting the job we didn't I think you figured that that we probably weren't going to be on the same page when it comes to what you've seen and I want to pull up the graphic that would just head up on screen there are roughly a dozen now investigations or inquiries or questions into some of the activities related to Scott Pruett a dozen or some people say 14 people say 11 there's more than a couple handfuls given that how does Scott Pruett emerge from this unscathed well the president seems to like him clearly he's doing what the president wants to do as far as rolling back environmental regulations which frankly are at least getting headlines unfortunately for us not all of them will be rolled back because there's a process you have to go through and he hasn't done that but he's sending a message that environment isn't important and that's what the president wants so that part of it is I understandable but the person could get anybody to do that I don't know what it is there's something special in this relationship that that keeps him there and I don't know what it is so then two quick questions before I let you go governor if you were gonna give advice to Scott Pruitt what would it be I'd reach out to the staff he has gotten them to a point where their morale is in the tank people are afraid to raise their head she's not getting good advice from the people that really know the issues because he won't let them talk Sarah Huckabee Sanders yesterday said the president does still have confidence in Pruitt should he I don't think so no not because he's not because Pruitt isn't doing what he the president wants him to do but because of all these other violations ethical and otherwise that are drawing scrutiny that just is unfair to the agency but it's also casting and spirt and light bad light on the administration as a whole governor Whitman thank you very much for being on the show I appreciate you making time for us this morning hey there I'm Chris Hayes from MSNBC thanks for watching MSNBC on YouTube if you want to keep up to date with the videos we're putting out you can click subscribe just below me or click over on this list to see lots of other great videos
