A BOSNIAN WAR CRIMES TRIAL TOOK AN EVEN DARKER TURN THAT YOU WOULD EXPECT. EXCELLENT SUBJECT MATTER THIS WEEK AND IN THIS VIDEO YOU ARE ABOUT TO SEE, YOU'RE GOING TO SEE SLOBODAN PRALJAK, A 72-YEAR-OLD WHO HAD BEEN PREVIOUSLY GIVEN A LENGTHY TERM, WANTED TO APPEAL THAT AND CAME BACK INTO COURT TO FIND OUT ABOUT WHAT WAS GOING TO HAPPEN TO HIM AND THEN THIS HAPPENED. I AM REJECTING THE COURT RULING. STOP, PLEASE. PLEASE SIT DOWN. I HAVE TAKEN POISON. MR. PRESIDENT, OUR CLIENT SAYS HE HAS TAKEN POISON. WE SUSPEND, PLEASE THE CURTAINS. YOU SEE THE JUDGE COMPLETELY DUMBSTRUCK ABOUT WHAT TO DO IN THAT SITUATION. HE DRANK A VIOLET POISON, SAID I HAVE TAKEN POISON AND THEN LATER DIED IN THE HOSPITAL FROM THE POISON HE INGESTED. SO HE HAD RECEIVED A 20 YEAR JAIL SENTENCE FOR BEING A WAR CRIMINAL BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT HE IS. BACK DURING THE BOSNIAN WAR OF 92 TO 95, IN THE BEGINNING THE BOSNIAN CROATS AND MUSLIMS WERE FIGHTING AGAINST THE SERBS. THEY HAD COMMITTED ATROCITIES, SOME OF WHICH WERE DEEMED A GENOCIDE AND IN 2013, HIS FORCES COMMITTED ATROCITIES AND HE DID NOT STOP THEM AND HE WAS SENTENCED FOR CRIMES THAT HAPPENED IN THE CITY OF MOSTAR AND NONETHELESS WHEN HE WAS SENTENCED, HE TOOK POISON AND I DON'T KNOW IF YOU'RE A WAR CRIMINAL, I DON'T KNOW IF IT'S AN UN-LIBERAL THING OF ME BUT I DON'T CARE. I THINK IT WAS THE GUY DURING THE NUREMBERG TRIALS WHO TOOK POISON AND PEOPLE SAID IT WAS A SHAME. WHY, WE WERE GOING TO HANG HIM ANYWAY? I GUESS IT WOULD'VE BEEN BETTER IF WE WOULD'VE HUNG THEM, BUT HE WAS A WAR CRIMINAL, HE WAS ADJUDICATED AS SUCH AND THEN DIED, BUT THE CROATIAN PRIME MINISTER, PLENKOVIC SAID THAT IT WAS A DEEP MORAL INJUSTICE TO THE CROATIAN PEOPLE BECAUSE NO MATTER WHAT, PEOPLE DEFEND THEIR OWN SO IN THAT CASE MUSLIMS WERE BUTCHERED AND THEY'RE LIKE YEAH, BUT THEY ARE NOT CROATS SO WHO CARES? AND NOT EVERYBODY DOES IT, THANK GOD FOR THAT BUT THE ONES WHO DO DO IT, OF COURSE THE OTTOMAN GOVERNMENT AND THEN HEY, WHERE DID ALL THE ARMENIANS GO, DON'T CARE. THEY'RE NOT GOING TO ADMIT IT AND THEY'RE NOT GOING TO TALK ABOUT THE GENOCIDE AND THEY ARE GOING TO PROTECT THEIR OWN. NOW THE CROATS, WHEN THE MUSLIMS ARE BUTCHERED AND HE KEEPS GOING AROUND AND AROUND AND AROUND. SO WHEN THIS GUY TAKES THE POISON AND ENDS HIS LIFE, IT IS A DRAMATIC MOMENT, BUT WHEN I CERTAINLY DON'T SHED A TEAR FOR. YOU COULD SAY THE LIBERAL POSITION IS PRO-EUTHANASIA. IF SOMEBODY WANTS TO TAKE THEIR OWN LIFE THEY CAN AND I GUESS HE DID THAT. HE GAVE HIMSELF THE DEATH SENTENCE THERE BUT AS YOU SAID, IN THIS PERSON YOU SEE A MICROCOSM OF THIS INABILITY TO FACE WHAT YOU'VE DONE, THE BELIEF THAT EITHER WE SHOULDN'T TALK ABOUT IT, OR IF IT WAS DONE FOR YOUR COMMUNITY, DURING A TIME OF WAR, IS IT REALLY A CRIME ANYWAY? WHERE PEOPLE BEING PC IN THIS WAY WHEN IT COMES TO WAR CRIMES? I'M SORRY, IT IS ALL ACROSS THE WORLD. COLUMBUS DOES AND FOR WHATEVER INSANE REASON, ITALIAN AMERICANS HAVE LATCHED ONTO CHRISTOPHER COLUMBUS. I GET IT WITH THE TRADITION OR WHATEVER DIE HE WIPES OUT MILLIONS OF PEOPLE. ALMOST THE DEFINITION OF A GENOCIDE. NO, COLUMBUS IS GREAT. ANDREW JACKSON, TRAIL OF TEARS, MARCHES NATIVE AMERICANS, THEY DIE IN THIS RELOCATION. NO, ANDREW JACKSON IS ONE OF US. HEÃ­S AWESOME. SO DONALD TRUMP, AND COMMEMORATING NATIVE AMERICANS WHO SERVED IN WORLD WAR II AND WERE INSTRUMENTAL IN DEFEATING THE NON-SEAS, DOES IN FRONT OF AN INJURED JACKSON PICTURE BECAUSE NO, HE'S OUR START AND THE TURKEYS PRESENT-DAY TURKISH GOVERNMENT. THE ARMENIANS WERE MARCHED OUT, WHY? DID THEY DECIDE UP AND LEAVE? NO, THEY WERE MARCHED OUT BECAUSE THE TURKISH GOVERNMENT, OR THE OTTOMAN GOVERNMENT AT THE TIME HAD A BARE MINIMUM ALLOWED IT, MADE A HABIT, ETC. DID THEY JUST DECIDE TO LEAVE THEIR HOMES? NO, IT'S BECAUSE WERE TURKISH, WE HAVE TO DEFEND IT AND NOT ADMITTED THAT THEY'RE NOT THERE ANYMORE. AND YES, A LOT OF THEM DIED. YES A LOT OF THEM DIED AND SO BUT NO, IF YOU'RE TURKISH YOU DEFEND THE TURKS, IF YOU'RE CROAT YOU DEFEND THE CROATS AND ON AND ON IT GOES. HERE IN AMERICA WE HAVE PEOPLE WHO DO THIS DAY TRY TO SAY SLAVERY? NOT AS BAD AS YOU LIBERALS TRY TO MAKE IT OUT TO BE. POSSIBLY THE DARKEST STAIN ON OUR COUNTRY'S PAST, THEY TRY TO SPEND AS BEING AN OKAY THING. THERE WERE PEOPLE EARLIER THIS YEAR DEFENDING THE JAPANESE CONCENTRATION KIND CAMPS. PEOPLE WHO DEFEND THE BOMBING OF HOW TO SURE NOT TO SAKE. WE HAVE OUR OWN THINGS AND WE HAVE HUGE DEMOGRAPHICS OF OUR POPULATION WHO REFUSE TO ADMIT THAT OUR HISTORY IS LITTERED WITH TERRIBLE ACTS OF THAT NATURE. AND BILL O'REILLY SAYING, MAYBE SLAVES BUT THE WHITE HOUSE, BUT THEY WERE LUCKY BECAUSE THEY GOT FOOD AND CLOTHING. YEAH THE SLAVES WERE SO LUCKY. AS LONG AS IT IS YOUR GUYS DOING IT, IT IS ALWAYS OKAY, BUT IT IS NOT OKAY. I WISH WE WOULD IDENTIFY AS FELLOW HUMAN BEINGS RATHER THAN WHATEVER PARTICULAR TRIBE THAT YOU HAPPEN TO COME FROM. THE ACTIONS OF PROJECT IN THE FIRST PLACE WERE DESPICABLE. I'M GLAD HE WAS CONVICTED AS A WAR CRIMINAL THAT HE IS. THE ACTIONS OF THE CROATIAN PRIME MINISTER STILL DEFENDING INTO THEY ARE ABHORRENT.
