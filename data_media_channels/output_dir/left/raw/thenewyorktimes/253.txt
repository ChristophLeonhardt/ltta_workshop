1
00:00:10,416 --> 00:00:12,896
[street sounds]

2
00:00:12,896 --> 00:00:16,450
[siren wailing]

3
00:00:19,344 --> 00:00:22,344
[footsteps]

4
00:00:23,808 --> 00:00:27,292
[fire engine honking]

5
00:00:31,248 --> 00:00:33,552
[car horn honking]

6
00:00:35,216 --> 00:00:39,950
It’s hard to imagine that a sound 
could transform someone’s life,

7
00:00:39,950 --> 00:00:43,018
but it happened to me.

8
00:00:43,018 --> 00:00:44,430
[truck rumbling]

9
00:00:45,118 --> 00:00:47,488
[insect buzzing]

10
00:00:47,488 --> 00:00:49,390
[bird chirping]

11
00:00:49,390 --> 00:00:52,630
I was 27 years old and
on one of those road

12
00:00:52,630 --> 00:00:56,413
trips between your old
life and your new one.

13
00:00:56,413 --> 00:00:57,736
[bird singing]

14
00:00:57,736 --> 00:01:01,420
I pulled over to get some rest.

15
00:01:01,420 --> 00:01:02,380
[thunder crashing]

16
00:01:02,380 --> 00:01:08,540
As I lay on the ground, I
watched a storm develop.

17
00:01:08,540 --> 00:01:10,910
I remember hearing
the thunder define

18
00:01:10,910 --> 00:01:15,612
the far reaches of the valley
as the storm passed over me,

19
00:01:15,612 --> 00:01:17,178
drenching me.

20
00:01:17,178 --> 00:01:18,667
[rain pounding]

21
00:01:19,686 --> 00:01:24,340
This was the first time I
experienced true listening.

22
00:01:27,170 --> 00:01:30,396
I guess you could say
that was my baptism.

23
00:01:30,396 --> 00:01:32,388
[thunder crashing]

24
00:01:33,384 --> 00:01:35,874
[rain pattering lightly]

25
00:01:40,854 --> 00:01:43,576
[birds singing]

26
00:02:04,372 --> 00:02:06,300
[woodpecker hammering]

27
00:02:06,300 --> 00:02:12,630
By holding a microphone, I
became a better listener.

28
00:02:12,630 --> 00:02:14,250
I learned that a
microphone doesn’t

29
00:02:14,250 --> 00:02:16,870
listen for what’s important.

30
00:02:16,870 --> 00:02:18,900
It doesn’t judge.

31
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:23,030
It doesn’t interfere.

32
00:02:23,030 --> 00:02:25,380
[sea bird cawing]

33
00:02:25,380 --> 00:02:27,480
My whole life I had
been listening for what

34
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:33,600
was important rather than taking
things in with equal value.

35
00:02:37,072 --> 00:02:39,060
[frogs croaking]

36
00:02:39,060 --> 00:02:42,561
Every place has a sound.

37
00:02:42,561 --> 00:02:45,490
[water rippling]

38
00:02:45,490 --> 00:02:48,618
A passing breeze that
indicates a weather change.

39
00:02:48,618 --> 00:02:50,610
[wind blowing]

40
00:02:50,610 --> 00:02:51,610
[bird cawing]

41
00:02:51,610 --> 00:02:55,368
The first bird songs of spring.

42
00:02:55,368 --> 00:02:56,810
[whistling wind]

43
00:02:56,810 --> 00:03:02,215
And the shifting tide reminding
us of the celestial ballet.

44
00:03:04,820 --> 00:03:10,510
All of these experiences
connect us back to the land.

45
00:03:10,510 --> 00:03:12,150
Just listen.

46
00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:14,130
[birds chirping]

47
00:03:16,605 --> 00:03:19,080
[high pitched screeching]

48
00:03:27,495 --> 00:03:29,970
[birds chirping]

49
00:03:41,712 --> 00:03:44,712
[waves and sea birds]

50
00:03:47,790 --> 00:03:55,470
Silence is the poetics of space,
what it means to be in a place.

51
00:03:58,490 --> 00:04:01,610
The whole topography of
the surrounding landscape

52
00:04:01,610 --> 00:04:06,020
is revealed to me in the
many layers of the echo

53
00:04:06,020 --> 00:04:07,974
that come towards me.

54
00:04:07,974 --> 00:04:09,730
[waves crashing]

55
00:04:09,730 --> 00:04:12,600
And I think to myself …

56
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:15,840
I know exactly where I am.

57
00:04:19,495 --> 00:04:22,495
[footsteps on sand]

58
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:27,231
Silence isn’t the
absence of something,

59
00:04:27,231 --> 00:04:30,267
but the presence of everything.

60
00:04:33,430 --> 00:04:36,460
When I speak of
silence, I mean silence

61
00:04:36,460 --> 00:04:39,400
from noise pollution
of modern life,

62
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:43,765
sounds that have nothing to do with
the natural acoustic system.

63
00:04:43,765 --> 00:04:45,430
[sea birds calling]

64
00:04:47,450 --> 00:04:55,586
Silence is the presence
of time undisturbed.

65
00:04:55,586 --> 00:04:58,930
It can be felt within the chest.

66
00:04:58,930 --> 00:05:01,736
It nurtures our nature.

67
00:05:01,736 --> 00:05:03,568
[waves crashing]

68
00:05:04,662 --> 00:05:08,294
And silence is on the
verge of extinction.

69
00:05:11,956 --> 00:05:14,426
[silence]

70
00:05:20,354 --> 00:05:23,654
[airplane engine]

71
00:05:28,770 --> 00:05:32,910
There is not one place
left on planet Earth that

72
00:05:32,910 --> 00:05:37,520
is set aside and off
limits to noise pollution,

73
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:40,570
not one square inch
of silence left

74
00:05:40,570 --> 00:05:43,290
untouched by the modern world.

75
00:05:45,718 --> 00:05:47,167
[horns honking]

76
00:05:47,167 --> 00:05:48,620
[jackhammer thudding]

77
00:05:48,620 --> 00:05:52,080
Our typical anti-noise
strategies offer no relief.

78
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:56,710
(MUFFLED) Earplugs,
(MORE MUFFLED)

79
00:05:56,710 --> 00:06:00,971
noise canceling headphones,
(REGULAR VOLUME)

80
00:06:00,971 --> 00:06:05,780
even noise abatement laws offer
no real solution, because they

81
00:06:05,780 --> 00:06:09,944
do nothing to help us reconnect
and listen to the land.

82
00:06:09,944 --> 00:06:11,405
[helicopter rattling]

83
00:06:11,405 --> 00:06:13,840
And the land is speaking.

84
00:06:17,249 --> 00:06:20,680
[insects and birds chirping]

85
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:25,270
When I listen, I
have to be quiet.

86
00:06:25,270 --> 00:06:28,724
I become very peaceful.

87
00:06:28,724 --> 00:06:31,700
[birds singing]

88
00:06:31,700 --> 00:06:36,860
And I think what I enjoy
most about listening

89
00:06:36,860 --> 00:06:40,350
is that I disappear.

90
00:06:40,350 --> 00:06:42,650
I disappear.

91
00:06:42,650 --> 00:06:44,180
[woodpecker hammering]

92
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:48,760
[high pitched screeching]

93
00:06:50,860 --> 00:06:52,360
[birds singing]

94
00:06:56,560 --> 00:00:00,000
[high pitched screeching]
