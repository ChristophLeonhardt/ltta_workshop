Before we jump into the next clip I just want to tell you real quick we've got a new audio network go to T y-t-dot-com slash audio and get all of our new podcasts you remember Joe Lieberman if you don't bless your heart he was a corporatist Democrat I mean the prototypical one there wasn't a war that he didn't love and he would often quote unquote cross the aisle to vote with the Republicans and shockingly it turns out every time to help his corporate friends and donors so he was challenged in a primary in a Democratic primary in Connecticut where he was a senator and he lost the Ned Lamont but he decided now I'm gonna run as an independent now back then when it helped corporate interests the Democratic Party didn't scream unity unity how dare you Joe and and Joe Lieberman wound up winning the general I should and they welcomed him back with open arms now he beat a Democratic opponent he was literally against the Democratic Party but they were ecstatic to have him Bernie Sanders caucuses with the Democrats he's an independent who's to the left of the Democrats they like a party some people say oh I don't know he's a real Democrat you accept Joe Lieberman and not him okay why is he in the news today though well you remember Alexandria Castillo Cortes dynamic progressive in New York beat Joe Crowley the fourth most powerful Democrat in the house now Crowley was also on the Working Families Party ticket and that's normal it working families party has the strongest base in New York and a lot of times they endorse people that are already Democrats and they did in this case now later they wound up regretting that because across here Cortez is far more progressive than Crowley and and and of course she won but working families parties a good party they're very progressive nothing wrong with them it's just that he happened to be on that ticket so he moves on as a member of the Working Families Party even though Crowley lost the Democratic primary so now he had an opportunity to get off the ballot and there was a lot of different ways you could say hey I'm filing for a different election which would then eliminate you from that election he chose not to get off of it he says well no no no I'm not running I'm not running I just I just couldn't get off to about I believe he could those deadlines might have passed but he could have he chose not to now Acacio Cortez called him out on that and he's like no no no I know I'm not running right golly Jesus nothing I can do to get off the ballot right and and she says that he didn't call on three different occasions to concede he says hell yeah we were just you know it's a miscommunication okay look you could say hey Fair Crowley did a wonderful thing on the night of the election he sang the song born to run about Acacio Cortez he seemed like a very gracious in defeat and and we gave him credit for that etc and maybe this is just the snafu etcetera but first of all none of the Democratic leaders talking about unity where is Nancy Pelosi saying Joe Crowley what are you doing no no no do not run he's not running that's ridiculous now if Pelosi said that I bet that Crowley would find a way to get off that ballot but all of a sudden never kind of leisure I'm not talking about unity so now why Joe Lieberman well nobody has ever been a better corporate Democrat than Joe Lieberman so he now does an editorial in the Wall Street Journal where he says Crowley should run wait I thought it wasn't possible at all I thought everybody was saying oh no no don't be ridiculous progressives don't be ridiculous or Cascio cortes of course Crowley's not running but now all of a sudden is an editorial saying maybe he should run so let's take a look at what the case that Lieberman made and shredded he begins by saying Alexander Acosta Court has a surprise primary victory over representative Joe Crowley seems likely to hurt Congress America and the Democratic Party whoa based on what if you're waiting for supporting evidence it does not arrive he has no supporting evidence he's just Ocasio Cortez is a real progressive and Joe Lieberman like a lot of the corporate Democrats hates real progressives so he says oh she's gonna hurt America hurt America based on what this is how much they despise progressives all right he continues because the policies miss Ocasio Cortes advocates are so far from the mainstream election in November would make it harder for Congress to stop fighting and start fixing problems okay let's break that one down first of all outside the mainstream cheers for Medicare for all that's 60 percent of the countries for Medicare for all she's forgetting money out of politics 93 percent of the countries for getting money out of politics the legalization of marijuana I'm sure Lieberman thinks it's ridiculous until of course corporations start selling it in which gives you buy go I was always in favor of it which is basically what John Boehner is now done so what do you mean that she's outside the mainstream her overall her positions poll excellent she's for expanding Social Security that polls at over 70 percent and the list goes on and on and on know what you mean is she's outside the mainstream of what our corporate donors want us to do and what we've been doing for decades she says well it would hurt her presence makes it hard to stop fighting the Republicans that's right we don't want to stop fighting the Republicans have you seen the Republican Party lately and you want to stop fighting them you see Trump as the head of the Republican Party and Joe Lieberman as great idea is don't hurt America stop fighting Republicans Wow that is genius political analysis Joe I wonder why you're not in the Senate anymore and he says start fixing problems how would you fix problems by agreeing with the Republicans or Donald Trump what agree to more gigantic tax cuts for the rich agree to more wars agree to helping Russia what agree with them on what fix what problems they're the ones who caused the problems we're the solution so but he doesn't want that solution cuz he works for corporate America and he has been corrupt his whole career so this nonsense continues Lieberman says thanks to I love this one thanks to a small percentage of primary votes all the people of New York's 14th congressional district stand to lose a very effective representative in Washington what thanks for the people voting the guy I like better lost and I guess they're gay I thought it was a great candidate now the people didn't think he was a great candidate that's why they voted him out but now you're gonna lose a good guy who helped corporations all the time in the big banks and the defense contractors I hope you're happy yeah we are happy it's called democracy Joe I know you hate it but it is democracy it's what the people wanted so and then my favorite part of that is like it's a primary not a lot of people vote we've been saying for years the New York State's primaries are too closed progressives want to open them up or we want people to be able to register all the way to the election time Alexandria costume Cortes fought for that we wanted broader elections now the party that wanted to keep the narrow primaries because they thought it was to their advantage afterwards now that they lose they cry the bribers in New York they're cooked to constricted that's what we've been saying you guys are unbelievable liars you don't believe anything you say all is it's all about power how do I keep our primaries need to be small they don't need to be large whatever you don't believe in unity you don't believe in anything but where's the money that's who you are Joe Lieberman okay he goes on to say her dreams of a new federal spending would bankrupt the country or require a very large tax increases including on the working class Oh progressive ideas by the way let's just note that this guy his whole life was theoretically a Democrat but in this establishment corporatist Democratic Party that is unfortunately what the Democrats became he was he ran for vice-president on the national ticket of the Democrats he hates progressives he's making the Republican points about oh if you do the progressive ideas it'll bankrupt the country that's what Republicans say by the way let's now look at facts because Joe didn't have any in his column you want talk about bankrupting the country hey Joe didn't you vote for the Iraq war how'd that go alright that costs two point four trillion dollars no Joe Lieberman our ideas don't bankrupt the country your ideas bankrupted the country and I'm being generous there there's a lot of people who feel that the Iraq war when you talk about the interest that accrues on the debt that we use to finance the war the cost of the medical problems that the veterans have etcetera that number should be way higher than two point four trillion dollars and I didn't even include Afghanistan or all of our other military misadventures all of which Joe Lieberman voted for as he was bankrupting the country those are facts and I know that the establishment hates facts the sad day for you so that's a fact you want to see what else banks of bankruptcy country Bush his tax cuts three point five trillion dollars now again I'm gonna be super generous here the Donald Trump's tax cuts in the beginning they said that it will only cost one point five trillion dollars there was a new analysis Trump's tax cuts actually already are up to one point nine trillion dollars in costs and the cost keep mounting and mounting your mountain but all that went to the rich it went to defense contractors it went to the oil companies it went to the millionaires billionaires in the and the top corporations so Joe Lieberman was like yes let's bankrupt the country as long as my friends get paid oh you want to cost your car test you won't actually help your the voters the actual citizens of the Queens and Bronx uh you're gonna you're gonna cost money by the way even that is not true Medicare for all doesn't cost money it saves trillions of dollars it's one lie after another after another so it and by the way the analysis that Medicare for all saves trillions of dollars is based on what other developed countries have done and how they have saved costs by making sure that they cut out the middleman like the insurance companies but the insurance companies a lot of them based in Connecticut and Joe Lieberman served those assurance companies they were his boss do you know who killed a public option you're not gonna be surprised to find out it was Joe Lieberman so Barack Obama during the Affordable Care Act progresses pushed for the public option and and it was such a simple idea hey you guys have private options you have all these different medical insurance why don't we offer a public option so you could buy one from the government I mean you guys say the government sucks I'm sure that nobody's gonna buy it right it doesn't matter it's no threat to anybody no they actually knew that it actually would be a option so Joe Lieberman said to Obama under no circumstances are you to do the public option because I get all my donor money from those insurance companies and they do not want competition they do not want capitalism they would like to destroy capitalism by doing crony capitalism that's who Joe Lieberman is now you want to talk about bankrupting the country I'm not done with you yet then he goes on to foreign policy now again Lieberman is never not voted for a war and he was an enthusiastic supporter of the Iraq war with the greatest foreign policy blunder of our lifetimes perhaps of entire American history unchastened by that he says among the different things that he attacks her on he says her opposition to American leadership in the world that's read America attacking and bombing as many countries as possible and even to alleviate humanitarian disasters like in Syria oh is that what we're doing in Syria alleviating manatorian disasters is we do that by dropping bombs right how do we alleviate human humanitarian disasters by bomb after bomb after bomb and how's the humanitarian situation working out in Iraq Joe you started that mess you're one of the biggest cheerleaders Joe and it created Isis it created a humanitarian debacle millions of people displaced hundreds of thousands of innocent civilians dead and you're still writing about oh my god this woman is she's dangerous she doesn't even want to start more Wars which will be our humanitarian missions you are despicable but I'm not done yet she said he says about Crowley I know him as a bridge builder and problem solver which is exactly what Congress needs more of in both parties back to a joke Crowley would have agreed with the Republicans he would have built bridges to the Republicans and he would in greed that you know what your money should be in their pocket and in the corporate pockets and no one should ever fight for you the voter oh poor Joe Crowley I guess we're gonna miss him right maybe not maybe he'll continue and you'll get egged on by corporate Democrats like Joe Lieberman hey that's his call not my call if he get finds a way to get off I'll give them all the credit in the world say was that loony Joe Lieberman guy okay but if Crowley he continues gogo golly gee there's nothing I could do how about the leadership how about Nancy Pelosi will actually Lieberman talked about that and he said Nancy Pelosi has been quiet about this it's true she has what happened to unity representative Pelosi I know that was your whole thing but oh yeah hey everybody unity do whatever you do do not primary but my incumbents do not primary the corporate Democrats okay I don't want any of that stuff okay it doesn't matter we won so Democratic Party gonna support her instead Pelosi dismissed Ocasio core tests and said I says what district just demographics which she was absolutely wrong about by the way white people voted for Acacio Cortes in her district and a greater rate than minorities did oops but look at the dismissive nature of Pelosi oh it was just the minorities it was just demographics it's not even correct so Lieberman says she knows referring to Pelosi she knows that if Democrats her to regain a majority it will be by winning swing districts was sensible mainstream candidates missive Cascio Cortes is making that task harder across America now right and wrong the wrong part is and I can't wait for us to be proven right on this as we were on our Casio Cortez's victory that progressive ideas appeal to real voters for more than what he calls mainstream which is another code word for corporate democratic ideas so the Nancy Pelosi Joe Lieberman camp of geniuses that includes Joe Crowley thought hey let's raise billions of dollars from the banks and let's go do whatever the banks and corporations want and I bet people in the middle of Kansas will love that idea they don't they hate that idea our thesis is that if you run as a progressive populist and you say I'm actually going to look out for the voters I'm not taking any corporate PAC money they can't corrupt me because I'm not taking their money I'm going to serve you guys that that is gonna work a thousand times better and that's exactly what they're afraid of right now as we speak Alexandria Casa Cortez and Bernie Sanders are on their way to Kansas on Friday they're gonna do a rally for Brent welder and James Thompson to other justice Democrats to other strong progressives who will not take corporate PAC money they're both leading they're both doing amazing in the middle of Kansas and that is what's got Lieberman and Pelosi and the others in a panic what if people find out we've been lying or even if you want to say no they didn't have bad intent we've been wrong the whole time the establishment that told you take the corporate money and that somehow the voters will appreciate you for that you've been wrong the whole time you know what they thought is said that you're the party of the elite the Democratic Party used to be the party of the average American the worker and you've ruined that and now that we're exposing that all of a sudden Lieberman is out of the woodwork don't don't don't find out don't find out if progressives can actually win in these districts yeah that's what I thought Joe that's what I thought but the thing he is right about is Pelosi not a word where are you Nancy Pelosi and where's unity why aren't you going out there and going Acacio cortes won the Democratic primary she is a Democratic candidate and we will unify behind her nothing they never believed in unity all they wanted was conformity they wanted you to bow your heads well we didn't so sad day for you Joe Lieberman go back into retirement you're pathetic two easy ways for the young turks want us hit the subscribe button down below then
