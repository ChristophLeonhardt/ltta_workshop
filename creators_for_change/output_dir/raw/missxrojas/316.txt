34
00:01:03,510 --> 00:01:05,309
every year when it gets to the Christmas

35
00:01:05,309 --> 00:01:07,320
or seasonal or just cold time of year

36
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:09,060
I've<font color="#CCCCCC"> started this year's batch of mulled</font>

37
00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:11,010
wine and I've had a really good few

38
00:01:11,010 --> 00:01:13,979
sessions perfecting the art of how to

39
00:01:13,979 --> 00:01:16,049
make the flavors come out of it<font color="#E5E5E5"> but also</font>

40
00:01:16,049 --> 00:01:17,700
not be to better the one I've been

41
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:19,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">drinking is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the marks</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and spencers Brad</font>

42
00:01:19,380 --> 00:01:21,780
and what I found is if you cut half an

43
00:01:21,780 --> 00:01:23,880
orange into little wedges and he put

44
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:25,200
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> in a saucepan as your heating up</font>

45
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:28,170
the mulled wine have if ideally sticks

46
00:01:28,170 --> 00:01:29,700
of cinnamon but you can use cinnamon

47
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:32,250
powder as well and then some sugar<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

48
00:01:32,250 --> 00:01:35,189
that makes it<font color="#E5E5E5"> all just amazing you could</font>

49
00:01:35,189 --> 00:01:37,920
actually even add a little cup<font color="#E5E5E5"> of water</font>

50
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:40,409
<font color="#E5E5E5">because the mark suspects</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is one it is</font>

51
00:01:40,409 --> 00:01:43,110
really bitter and dry unless you add the

52
00:01:43,110 --> 00:01:44,909
magical concoction so mulled wine

53
00:01:44,909 --> 00:01:47,939
prepared properly oh it just makes me so

54
00:01:47,939 --> 00:01:50,369
happy also going up this month strangely

55
00:01:50,369 --> 00:01:52,740
domestic tasks I've been doing things

56
00:01:52,740 --> 00:01:55,470
like cleaning mold of my bathroom walls

57
00:01:55,470 --> 00:01:58,500
and raking the leaves in the patio that

58
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:00,899
<font color="#CCCCCC">we have outside removing large panes of</font>

59
00:02:00,899 --> 00:02:02,759
glass left here by the previous tenants

60
00:02:02,759 --> 00:02:05,189
they like that but I really appreciated

61
00:02:05,189 --> 00:02:07,079
it in a way that I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't think I ever</font>

62
00:02:07,079 --> 00:02:09,000
did when I was<font color="#E5E5E5"> living at home and doing</font>

63
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,640
this family activities activities chores

64
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:13,470
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> really nice to work on your living</font>

65
00:02:13,470 --> 00:02:15,060
base and make it something more your<font color="#E5E5E5"> own</font>

66
00:02:15,060 --> 00:02:17,130
even<font color="#E5E5E5"> if these are steps that everyone</font>

67
00:02:17,130 --> 00:02:19,500
who's lived here has taken<font color="#E5E5E5"> it yeah it</font>

68
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:21,750
just makes you feel<font color="#CCCCCC"> like something is</font>

69
00:02:21,750 --> 00:02:23,400
yours when you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> taking</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> good care of it</font>

70
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:25,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">I suppose maybe that's a really selfish</font>

71
00:02:25,140 --> 00:02:26,940
outlook on the world maybe if we<font color="#E5E5E5"> were</font>

72
00:02:26,940 --> 00:02:28,650
better people<font color="#E5E5E5"> we would just feel good if</font>

73
00:02:28,650 --> 00:02:30,390
we were taking care of everything i do

74
00:02:30,390 --> 00:02:32,070
feel good when I take care of other

75
00:02:32,070 --> 00:02:33,810
people's things but it's also nice to

76
00:02:33,810 --> 00:02:35,580
have something<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's yours or</font>

77
00:02:35,580 --> 00:02:37,410
communally yours if you live with a few

78
00:02:37,410 --> 00:02:39,000

00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:09,209
musical and it's making me wish that I

was as<font color="#E5E5E5"> up-to-date as I used to be with</font>

00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:13,410
<font color="#CCCCCC">the music the music scene I've been</font>

00:03:13,410 --> 00:03:14,580
listening to a lot of songs<font color="#E5E5E5"> from</font>

99
00:03:14,580 --> 00:03:16,920
summertime Wiggly and just not this

100
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:18,720
summer just summer times in general

104
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:29,760
that one beautifully sung the final

105
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:31,980
<font color="#CCCCCC">thing going up the humble tealight the</font>

106
00:03:31,980 --> 00:03:33,780
guys I live with a really into candles

107
00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:35,580
they love candles they spend a<font color="#CCCCCC"> lot of</font>

108
00:03:35,580 --> 00:03:37,110
money or consider spending a lot of

109
00:03:37,110 --> 00:03:39,060
<font color="#CCCCCC">money on candles and that's their</font>

110
00:03:39,060 --> 00:03:40,860
favorite thing to get I really like

111
00:03:40,860 --> 00:03:42,660
candles as well one of my<font color="#CCCCCC"> sisters</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> got me</font>

112
00:03:42,660 --> 00:03:44,549
really amazing hand off my 21st birthday

113
00:03:44,549 --> 00:03:46,500
that just smells absolutely incredible

114
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:47,970
it's burnt out now which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> really sad</font>

115
00:03:47,970 --> 00:03:50,220
but my favorite thing is the tea light

116
00:03:50,220 --> 00:03:52,950
and tea lights and jam jars just look so

117
00:03:52,950 --> 00:03:55,560
beautiful and they look so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't know</font>

118
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:57,269
<font color="#E5E5E5">I think that's the holiday season for me</font>

119
00:03:57,269 --> 00:03:59,730
that kind of reflective<font color="#CCCCCC"> light that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font>

120
00:03:59,730 --> 00:04:02,100
recall outside and it's a little<font color="#CCCCCC"> bit too</font>

121
00:04:02,100 --> 00:04:03,720
windy<font color="#CCCCCC"> for it to be logically possible</font>

122
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:06,150
for these candles to stay alight but

123
00:04:06,150 --> 00:04:08,940
they do by the magic<font color="#E5E5E5"> of magic and then</font>

124
00:04:08,940 --> 00:04:10,620
sometimes the work spills over and the

125
00:04:10,620 --> 00:04:12,360
tea<font color="#CCCCCC"> light is stuck at bottom</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of a jam</font>

126
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:14,370
jar that this part they delight as well

127
00:04:14,370 --> 00:04:15,720
I'm starting to think I'm a bit weird

128
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:17,940
