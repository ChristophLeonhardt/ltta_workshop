THIS IS MY STATEMENT.

15
00:00:28,855 --> 00:00:30,690
LESS THAN TWO WEEKS AGO,

HER LONG-TIME FRIEND,

00:00:59,252 --> 00:01:01,187
MRS. KAISER, SAID UNDER PENALTY

33
00:01:01,187 --> 00:01:01,187

37
00:01:07,561 --> 00:01:07,561
DOES NOT BELIEVE SHE EVER SAW ME

38
00:01:07,561 --> 00:01:09,696
AT A PARTY EVER.

39
00:01:09,696 --> 00:01:10,630
HERE’S THE QUOTE FROM

40
00:01:10,630 --> 00:01:15,469
MRS. KAISER’S ATTORNEY LETTER.

41
00:01:15,469 --> 00:01:17,671
"SIMPLY PUT, MRS. KAISER DOES

00:01:17,671 --> 00:01:19,072

43
00:01:19,072 --> 00:01:20,374
HAS NO RECOLLECTION OF EVER

WHITE DR. FORD."

47
00:01:30,217 --> 00:01:33,554
THINK ABOUT THAT FACT.

48
00:01:33,554 --> 00:01:36,056
THE DAY AFTER THE ALLEGATION

49
00:01:36,056 --> 00:01:38,192

50
00:01:38,192 --> 00:01:38,192

THAT I WANTED A HEARING AS SOON

53
00:01:41,629 --> 00:01:43,197
AS POSSIBLE TO CLEAR MY NAME.

54
00:01:43,197 --> 00:01:46,534
I DEMANDED A HEARING FOR THE

55
00:01:46,534 --> 00:01:48,202

56
00:01:48,202 --> 00:01:50,371
UNFORTUNATELY, IT TOOK THE

00:01:50,371 --> 00:01:52,973

58
00:01:52,973 --> 00:01:54,942

00:02:13,594 --> 00:02:16,931
HARMFUL TO ME AND MY FAMILY, TO

THE SUPREME COURT AND TO THE

72
00:02:20,902 --> 00:02:22,136
WHEN THIS ALLEGATION FIRST

73
00:02:22,136 --> 00:02:26,474
AROSE, I WELCOMED ANY KIND OF

74
00:02:26,474 --> 00:02:27,742

SENATE, FBI OR OTHERWISE.

76
00:02:29,410 --> 00:02:31,546
THOROUGH INVESTIGATION.

THE COMMITTEE NOW IS CONDUCTED A

78
00:02:32,647 --> 00:02:35,383
I’VE COOPERATED FULLY.

79
00:02:35,383 --> 00:02:38,753
I KNOW THAT ANY KIND OF

80
00:02:38,753 --> 00:02:41,656

81
00:02:41,656 --> 00:02:42,657
MONTGOMERY COUNTY POLICE,

82
00:02:42,657 --> 00:02:47,028
WHATEVER WILL CLEAR ME.

83
00:02:47,028 --> 00:02:48,196
LISTEN TO THE PEOPLE I KNOW.

84
00:02:48,196 --> 00:02:50,031
LISTEN TO THE PEOPLE THAT HAVE

85
00:02:50,031 --> 00:02:51,299

86
00:02:51,299 --> 00:02:54,169
LISTEN TO THE PEOPLE THAT I’VE

87
00:02:54,169 --> 00:02:56,037
GROWN UP WITH AND WORKED WITH

88
00:02:56,037 --> 00:02:58,607

95
00:03:08,917 --> 00:03:10,352
YEARS AGO.

96
00:03:10,352 --> 00:03:13,155
LISTEN TO MISS KAISER.

97
00:03:13,155 --> 00:03:15,090
SHE DOES NOT KNOW ME.

98

I WAS NOT AT THE PARTY DESCRIBED

99
00:03:18,093 --> 00:03:18,093
I WAS NOT AT THE PARTY DESCRIBED

100
00:03:18,093 --> 00:03:20,496
BY DR. FORD.

101
00:03:20,496 --> 00:03:23,399
THIS CONFIRMATION PROCESS HAS

102
00:03:23,399 --> 00:03:25,501
BECOME A NATIONAL DISGRACE.

103
00:03:25,501 --> 00:03:28,437
THE CONSTITUTION GIVES THE

104
00:03:28,437 --> 00:03:31,240
SENATE AN IMPORTANT ROLE IN THE

105
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:31,240

BUT YOU HAVE REPLACED ADVICE AND

108
00:03:36,145 --> 00:03:36,145

CONSENT WITH SEARCH AND DESTROY.

110
00:03:38,547 --> 00:03:38,547
CONSENT WITH SEARCH AND DESTROY.

111
00:03:38,547 --> 00:03:40,516
SINCE MY NOMINATION IN JULY,

112
00:03:40,516 --> 00:03:42,818
THERE’S BEEN A FRENZY ON THE

113
00:03:42,818 --> 00:03:46,055
LEFT TO COME UP WITH SOMETHING,

114
00:03:46,055 --> 00:03:46,055
LEFT TO COME UP WITH SOMETHING,

115
00:03:46,055 --> 00:03:48,457
ANYTHING TO BLOCK MY

116
00:03:48,457 --> 00:03:48,891
CONFIRMATION.

117
00:03:48,891 --> 00:03:50,593
SHORTLY AFTER I WAS NOMINATED,

118
00:03:50,593 --> 00:03:52,295
THE DEMOCRATIC SENATE LEADER

119
00:03:52,295 --> 00:03:55,798
SAID HE WOULD OPPOSE ME WITH

120
00:03:55,798 --> 00:03:56,566
EVERYTHING HE’S GOT.

121
00:03:56,566 --> 00:03:59,535
A DEMOCRATIC SENATOR ON THIS

122
00:03:59,535 --> 00:04:02,438
COMMITTEE PUBLICLY REFERRED TO

123
00:04:02,438 --> 00:04:05,508
ME AS EVIL.

124
00:04:05,508 --> 00:04:05,942
EVIL.

125
00:04:05,942 --> 00:04:06,976
THINK ABOUT THAT WORD.

126
00:04:06,976 --> 00:04:10,079
SAID THAT THOSE THAT SUPPORTED

127
00:04:10,079 --> 00:04:13,349
ME WERE "COMPLICIT AND EVIL."

128
00:04:13,349 --> 00:04:15,919
ANOTHER DEMOCRATIC SENATOR ON

129
00:04:15,919 --> 00:04:18,521
THIS COMMITTEE SAID "JUDGE

130
00:04:18,521 --> 00:04:20,490
KAVANAUGH IS YOUR WORST

131
00:04:20,490 --> 00:04:20,890
NIGHTMARE."

132
00:04:20,890 --> 00:04:24,260
A FORMER HEAD OF THE DEMOCRATIC

133
00:04:24,260 --> 00:04:24,260
A FORMER HEAD OF THE DEMOCRATIC

134
00:04:24,260 --> 00:04:26,162
NATIONAL COMMITTEE SAID "JUDGE

135
00:04:26,162 --> 00:04:27,697
KAVANAUGH WILL THREATEN THE

136
00:04:27,697 --> 00:04:30,700
LIVES OF MILLIONS OF AMERICANS

137
00:04:30,700 --> 00:04:35,005
FOR DECADES TO COME."

138
00:04:35,005 --> 00:04:37,774
I UNDERSTAND THE PASSIONS OF THE

139
00:04:37,774 --> 00:04:37,774
I UNDERSTAND THE PASSIONS OF THE

140
00:04:37,774 --> 00:04:38,108
MOMENT.

141
00:04:38,108 --> 00:04:42,579
I WOULD SAY TO THOSE SENATORS,

142
00:04:42,579 --> 00:04:44,381
YOUR WORDS HAVE MEANING.

143
00:04:44,381 --> 00:04:47,584
MILLIONS OF AMERICANS LISTENED

144
00:04:47,584 --> 00:04:49,486
CAREFULLY TO YOU.

145
00:04:49,486 --> 00:04:52,556
GIVEN COMMENTS LIKE THOSE, IS IT

146
00:04:52,556 --> 00:04:52,556
GIVEN COMMENTS LIKE THOSE, IS IT

147
00:04:52,556 --> 00:04:54,958
ANY SURPRISE THAT PEOPLE HAVE

148
00:04:54,958 --> 00:04:56,960
BEEN WILLING TO DO ANYTHING TO

149
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:59,396
MAKE ANY PHYSICAL THREAT AGAINST

150
00:04:59,396 --> 00:04:59,396
MAKE ANY PHYSICAL THREAT AGAINST

151
00:04:59,396 --> 00:05:00,564
MY FAMILY?

152
00:05:00,564 --> 00:05:03,267
TO SEND ANY VIOLENT E-MAIL TO MY

153
00:05:03,267 --> 00:05:03,267
TO SEND ANY VIOLENT E-MAIL TO MY

154
00:05:03,267 --> 00:05:06,503
WIFE, TO MAKE ANY KIND OF

155
00:05:06,503 --> 00:05:08,539
ALLEGATION AGAINST ME AND

156
00:05:08,539 --> 00:05:11,575
AGAINST MY FRIENDS TO BLOW ME UP

157
00:05:11,575 --> 00:05:11,575
AGAINST MY FRIENDS TO BLOW ME UP

158
00:05:11,575 --> 00:05:15,279
AND TAKE ME DOWN.

159
00:05:15,279 --> 00:05:17,281
YOU SOWED THE WIND FOR DECADES

160
00:05:17,281 --> 00:05:17,848
TO COME.

161
00:05:17,848 --> 00:05:21,118
I FEAR THAT THE WHOLE COUNTRY

162
00:05:21,118 --> 00:05:23,287
WILL REAP THE WHIRLWINDS.

163
00:05:23,287 --> 00:05:25,323
THE BEHAVIOR OF SEVERAL OF THE

164
00:05:25,323 --> 00:05:26,424
DEMOCRATIC MEMBERS OF THIS

165
00:05:26,424 --> 00:05:28,759
COMMITTEE AT MY HEARING A FEW

166
00:05:28,759 --> 00:05:30,895
WEEKS AGO WAS AN EMBARRASSMENT.

167
00:05:30,895 --> 00:05:33,364
BUT AT LEAST IT WAS JUST A GOOD

168
00:05:33,364 --> 00:05:33,364
BUT AT LEAST IT WAS JUST A GOOD

169
00:05:33,364 --> 00:05:36,467
OLD FASHIONED ATTEMPT AT

170
00:05:36,467 --> 00:05:36,801
BORKING.

171
00:05:36,801 --> 00:05:38,369
THOSE EFFORTS DIDN’T WORK.

172
00:05:38,369 --> 00:05:40,505
WHEN I DID AT LEAST OKAY ENOUGH

173
00:05:40,505 --> 00:05:40,505
WHEN I DID AT LEAST OKAY ENOUGH

174
00:05:40,505 --> 00:05:42,407
AT THE HEARINGS THAT IT LOOKS

175
00:05:42,407 --> 00:05:45,443
LIKE I MIGHT GET CONFIRMED, A

176
00:05:45,443 --> 00:05:46,744
NEW TACTIC WAS NEEDED.

177
00:05:46,744 --> 00:05:49,981
SOME OF YOU WERE LYING IN WAIT

178
00:05:49,981 --> 00:05:51,482
AND HAD IT READY.

179
00:05:51,482 --> 00:05:53,318
THIS FIRST ALLEGATION WAS HELD

180
00:05:53,318 --> 00:05:55,019
IN SECRET FOR WEEKS BY A

181
00:05:55,019 --> 00:05:57,822
DEMOCRATIC MEMBER OF THIS

182
00:05:57,822 --> 00:05:58,790
COMMITTEE AND BY STAFF.

183
00:05:58,790 --> 00:06:00,225
IT WOULD BE NEEDED ONLY IF YOU

184
00:06:00,225 --> 00:06:03,461
COULDN’T TAKE ME OUT ON THE

185
00:06:03,461 --> 00:06:03,795
MERITS.

186
00:06:03,795 --> 00:06:05,964
WHEN IT WAS NEEDED, THIS

187
00:06:05,964 --> 00:06:09,167
ALLEGATION WAS UNLEASHED AND

188
00:06:09,167 --> 00:06:11,703
PUBLICLY DEPLOYED OVER

189
00:06:11,703 --> 00:06:15,006

00:06:35,594 --> 00:06:38,096
GANGS, ILLEGITIMATE CHILDREN,

00:06:38,096 --> 00:06:40,999
FIGHTS ON BOATS IN RHODE ISLAND.

00:06:44,770 --> 00:06:47,673
UNCRITICALLY BY THE MEDIA.

207
00:06:47,673 --> 00:06:50,409
THIS IS DESTROYED MY FAMILY AND

208
00:06:50,409 --> 00:06:50,409
THIS IS DESTROYED MY FAMILY AND

209
00:06:50,409 --> 00:06:51,577
MY GOOD NAME.

210

DECADES OF VERY HARD WORK AND

00:06:55,948 --> 00:06:59,051

00:07:00,219 --> 00:07:01,587
GOVERNMENT.

215
00:07:01,587 --> 00:07:03,489
THIS WHOLE TWO-WEEK EFFORT HAS

216
00:07:03,489 --> 00:07:06,726
BEEN A CALCULATED AND

217
00:07:06,726 --> 00:07:08,728
ORCHESTRATED POLITICAL HIT.

218
00:07:08,728 --> 00:07:11,931
FUELED WITH APPARENT PENT-UP

219
00:07:11,931 --> 00:07:13,866
ANGER ABOUT PRESIDENT TRUMP AND

00:07:28,648 --> 00:07:31,484
OPPOSITION GROUPS.

229
00:07:31,484 --> 00:07:34,721
THIS IS A CIRCUS.

230
00:07:34,721 --> 00:07:35,688
THE CONSEQUENCES WILL EXTEND

231
00:07:35,688 --> 00:07:36,789
LONG PAST MY NOMINATION.

232
00:07:36,789 --> 00:07:40,627
THE CONSEQUENCES WILL BE WITH US

233
00:07:40,627 --> 00:07:40,627

FOR DECADES.

00:07:41,961 --> 00:07:45,632
THIS GROTESQUE AND COORDINATED

236
00:07:45,632 --> 00:07:47,767
CHARACTER ASSASSINATION WILL

237
00:07:47,767 --> 00:07:49,869
DISSUADE CONFIDENT AND GOOD

238
00:07:49,869 --> 00:07:54,207
PEOPLE OF ALL POLITICAL

00:07:54,207 --> 00:07:55,442
PERSUASIONS FROM SERVING OUR

240
00:07:55,442 --> 00:07:55,775

2000s, WHAT GOES AROUND COMES

245
00:08:03,250 --> 00:08:04,584

246
00:08:04,584 --> 00:08:06,753
I AM AN OPTIMISTIC GUY.

247
00:08:06,753 --> 00:08:08,488
I ALWAYS TRY TO BE ON THE

248
00:08:08,488 --> 00:08:09,790
SUNRISE SIDE OF THE MOUNTAIN TO

249
00:08:09,790 --> 00:08:09,790
SUNRISE SIDE OF THE MOUNTAIN TO

00:08:09,790 --> 00:08:12,893
BE OPTIMISTIC ABOUT THE DAY THAT

251
00:08:12,893 --> 00:08:12,893
BE OPTIMISTIC ABOUT THE DAY THAT

252
00:08:12,893 --> 00:08:16,230
IS COMING BUT TODAY, I HAVE TO

00:08:16,230 --> 00:08:20,467
SAY THAT I FEAR FOR THE FUTURE.

254
00:08:20,467 --> 00:08:22,169
LAST TIME I WAS HERE, I TOLD

255
00:08:22,169 --> 00:08:24,271
THIS COMMITTEE THAT A FEDERAL

256
00:08:24,271 --> 00:08:26,073
JUDGE MUST BE INDEPENDENT, NOT

257
00:08:26,073 --> 00:08:28,542
SWAYED BY PUBLIC OR POLITICAL

258
00:08:28,542 --> 00:08:29,376
PRESSURE.

259
00:08:29,376 --> 00:08:31,612
I SAID I WAS SUCH A JUDGE.

260
00:08:31,612 --> 00:08:32,279
AND I AM.

261
00:08:32,279 --> 00:08:35,549
I WILL NOT BE INTIMIDATED INTO

YOU GIVEN IT YOUR ALL.

265
00:08:42,490 --> 00:08:44,058
NO ONE CAN QUESTION YOUR EFFORT.

266
00:08:44,058 --> 00:08:44,058

DRAG ME OUT.

273
00:08:53,601 --> 00:08:56,070
THE VILE THREATS OF VIOLENCE

274
00:08:56,070 --> 00:08:58,673
AGAINST MY FAMILY WILL NOT DRIVE

275
00:08:58,673 --> 00:08:58,673
AGAINST MY FAMILY WILL NOT DRIVE

276
00:08:58,673 --> 00:08:59,173

277
00:08:59,173 --> 00:09:02,276
YOU MAY DEFEAT ME IN THE FINAL

278
00:09:02,276 --> 00:09:05,413
VOTE, BUT YOU’LL NEVER GET ME TO

279
00:09:05,413 --> 00:09:05,413
VOTE, BUT YOU’LL NEVER GET ME TO

280
00:09:05,413 --> 00:09:07,048
QUIT.

282
00:09:09,317 --> 00:09:10,785
I’M HERE TODAY TO TELL THE

283
00:09:10,785 --> 00:09:11,085
TRUTH.

284
00:09:11,085 --> 00:09:13,621
I’VE NEVER SEXUALLY ASSAULTED

285
00:09:13,621 --> 00:09:14,622
ANYONE.

286
00:09:14,622 --> 00:09:17,859
NOT IN HIGH SCHOOL, NOT IN

287
00:09:17,859 --> 00:09:20,161
COLLEGE, NOT EVER.

288
00:09:20,161 --> 00:09:22,897
SEXUAL ASSAULT IS HORRIFIC.

289
00:09:22,897 --> 00:09:24,733
ONE OF MY CLOSEST FRIENDS TO

290
00:09:24,733 --> 00:09:26,634
THIS DAY IS A WOMAN WHO WAS

291
00:09:26,634 --> 00:09:29,004
SEXUALLY ABUSED AND WHO IN THE

292
00:09:29,004 --> 00:09:31,673
1990s WHEN WE WERE IN OUR 30s

293
00:09:31,673 --> 00:09:34,509
CONFIDED IN ME ABOUT THE ABUSE.

294
00:09:34,509 --> 00:09:35,710
CONSULT MY ADVICE.

295
00:09:35,710 --> 00:09:39,247
I WAS ONE OF THE ONLY PEOPLE SHE

I WAS ONE OF THE ONLY PEOPLE SHE

297
00:09:39,247 --> 00:09:40,182
CONSULTED.

298
00:09:40,182 --> 00:09:42,150
ALLEGATIONS OF SEXUAL ASSAULT

299
00:09:42,150 --> 00:09:45,454
MUST ALWAYS BE TAKEN SERIOUSLY,

300
00:09:45,454 --> 00:09:45,454
MUST ALWAYS BE TAKEN SERIOUSLY,

301
00:09:45,454 --> 00:09:45,821
ALWAYS.

302
00:09:45,821 --> 00:09:48,557
THOSE THAT MAKE ALLEGATIONS

303
00:09:48,557 --> 00:09:51,393
ALWAYS DESERVE TO BE HEARD.

304
00:09:51,393 --> 00:09:52,894
AT THE SAME TIME, THE PERSON WHO

DUE PROCESS IS THE FOUNDATION OF

312
00:10:01,436 --> 00:10:03,338
THE AMERICAN RULE OF LAW.

313
00:10:03,338 --> 00:10:06,475
DUE PROCESS MEANS LISTENING TO

314
00:10:06,475 --> 00:10:13,115
BOTH SIDES.

THEY’RE HERE TODAY.

320
00:10:22,558 --> 00:10:24,994
WHEN I WAS 10, MY MOM WENT TO

321
00:10:24,994 --> 00:10:26,295
LAW SCHOOL.

322
00:10:26,295 --> 00:10:28,164
AS A LAWYER, SHE WORKED HARD AND

I DRANK BEER WITH MY FRIENDS.

893
00:29:41,203 --> 00:29:43,171
ALMOST EVERYONE DID.

894
00:29:43,171 --> 00:29:45,140
SOMETIMES I HAD TOO MANY BEERS.

895

THERE’S A BRIGHT LINE BETWEEN

904
00:30:04,827 --> 00:30:04,827

SEXUALLY ASSAULTING SOMEONE,

907
00:30:09,698 --> 00:30:11,700
WHICH IS A VIOLENT CRIME.

908
00:30:11,700 --> 00:30:14,637
IF EVERY AMERICAN THAT DRINKS

909
00:30:14,637 --> 00:30:16,639
