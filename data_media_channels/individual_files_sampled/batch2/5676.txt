join now about Renee Graham she is associate editor and columnist with the Boston Globe Renee thanks so much for your time this afternoon you you wrote an article when this child first got underway it caught our attention here he wrote in part that this wasn't just about Bill Cosby this was also about the me2 movement that the movement itself was on trial how do you think that the guilty verdict on Thursday affects the movement moving forward I think it says a lot about the strength of the movement I don't think that the verdict was simply about the me2 movement but I do think that there was a heightened sensibility in that courtroom about the harrowing stories that women have to tell and the fact that for years and for decades in fact that they aren't believed so I do think that the meets in Leuven was extraordinarily important in sort of a backdrop to the Cosby trial do you think that that the current climate had a lot to do with with Cosby being convicted I think there were a few elements at play I think it made a big difference in this trial compared to his earlier trial that other women got to testify so suddenly you had a pattern of behavior it wasn't just one woman saying this happened to her it was a series of women with very similar stories about Bill Cosby's behavior you know but that also fed into the idea of me too that is what the hashtag is which is wider honor Burke created it the idea that this doesn't just happen to one women or a few women there are thousands tens of thousands of women who can tell this story and I think what the jurors got was a taste of that in the courtroom Renee I don't I don't want to assume that you were big Cosby Show viewer but I was grew up on The Cosby Show and dr. Huxtable grew up wanting to be one of the Huxtable kids like millions of other folks in this country going back to the to the point that I made in the in the story there that just ran at the end reconciling this this man and what he has now been convicted of doing reconciling him with the character that he played on television with some of the other characters that he played as well and with his philanthropy and is it possible for both of those people to peacefully coexist I don't know that would use the word peacefully but you look you know what Bill Cosby did was this kind of purposeful welding of himself and cliff Huxtable and you know cliff Huxtable had five children Bill Cosby had five children cliff Huxtable had four daughters and one son both Cosby had four daughters four daughters and one son I think that there was this really purposeful effort to join these two men together so if you love to cliff Huxtable you loved Bill Cosby you know and you know it worked for him because it became a shield he was America's dad a title he didn't give himself by the way that was what the public gave him and really embraced so you know yes I think it was great that Bill Cosby was a philanthropist and Bill Cosby was a you know broke cultural barriers but it doesn't mask the fact that Bill Cosby is now a convicted felon he was convicted he is a convicted sex offender and I think more than anything else Bill Cosby achieved I think that's what Bill Cosby these to be remembered for you know it's it's also you also do have to wonder if Cosby had not really put himself out as this sort of moral voice and he really did I mean Bill Cosby spent the better part of the 90s and early 2000s telling him like black boys to pull their pants up and stop using profanity you do have to wonder if he had not put himself out there like that if perhaps some of this might not have been been brought down on it well you know given the stories I think that existed about Bill Cosby for decades it hit people really hard that here he was coming out as this moralist and telling other people how to conduct their lives and how to be you know and everyone knew or a lot of people certainly knew there were all these rumors about Bill Cosby not just being a philanderer which of course isn't against the law but the fact that he was drugging and sexually assaulting women you know none of these things were were surprising it's just that it's fun they took Charlie took root in a very different way in and 2014 when Hamilton Buress mentioned it but you know the tragedy of this of course is that it took that you know he think of all the women who might have been saved from the faith if people had taken seriously the stories of women in earlier generations it's really disturbed when you think about that hopefully that starts to change now Renae Graham with the Boston Globe Rene thank you hey there I'm Chris Hayes from MSNBC thanks for watching MSNBC on YouTube if you want to keep up to date with the videos we're putting out you can click subscribe just below me or click over on this list to see lots of other great videos
