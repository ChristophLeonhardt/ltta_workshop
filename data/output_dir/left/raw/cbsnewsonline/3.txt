1
00:00:01,568 --> 00:00:03,369
ME, I'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT 

2
00:00:03,369 --> 00:00:04,070
DRUG PRICE REDUCTIONS FOR A 

3
00:00:04,070 --> 00:00:05,805
LONG TIME, AND NOW WE ARE DOING 

4
00:00:05,805 --> 00:00:09,209
THINGS THAT NOBODY WAS, LET'S 

5
00:00:09,209 --> 00:00:10,243
SAY, SPEAKING ON BEHALF OF ALL 

6
00:00:10,243 --> 00:00:13,580
OF US, BOLD ENOUGH TO DO, THEY 

7
00:00:13,580 --> 00:00:15,148
ARE GOING TO HAVE A TREMENDOUS 

8
00:00:15,148 --> 00:00:19,719
IMPACT, I WENT TO THANKS THE 

9
00:00:19,719 --> 00:00:21,454
FDA COMMISSIONER SCOTT GOTTLIEB,

10
00:00:21,454 --> 00:00:25,792
AN INCREDIBLE JOB. 

11
00:00:25,792 --> 00:00:31,197
AND CMS ADMINISTRATOR, GREAT 

12
00:00:31,197 --> 00:00:36,569
JOB.

13
00:00:36,569 --> 00:00:37,937
>>> I AM THRILLED TO BE HERE AT 

14
00:00:37,937 --> 00:00:38,738
THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND 

15
00:00:38,738 --> 00:00:41,441
HUMAN SERVICES, AND I WANT TO 

16
00:00:41,441 --> 00:00:43,442
THINK EVERYBODY, I UNDERSTAND 

17
00:00:43,442 --> 00:00:44,410
THERE HAS BEEN DECADES SINCE 

18
00:00:44,410 --> 00:00:45,478
THE LAST PRESIDENT CAME HERE. 

19
00:00:45,478 --> 00:00:46,946
I AM SURPRISED THAT PRESIDENT 

20
00:00:46,946 --> 00:00:49,916
OBAMA DIDN'T COME HERE FOR 

21
00:00:49,916 --> 00:00:50,583
OBAMACARE, EXPLAINED THAT TO 

22
00:00:50,583 --> 00:00:57,323
ME, BUT HE DIDN'T. 

23
00:00:57,323 --> 00:00:58,525
HE GREAT HONOR TO BE HERE, YOU 

24
00:00:58,525 --> 00:01:00,927
DO AN INCREDIBLE JOB. 

25
00:01:00,927 --> 00:01:02,629
I THINK YOU. 

26
00:01:02,629 --> 00:01:06,332
SINCE THE DAY I TOOK OFFICE, I 

27
00:01:06,332 --> 00:01:08,901
MADE REDUCING DRUG PRICES MY 

28
00:01:08,901 --> 00:01:10,103
PRIORITY, MORE THAN 1000 LOW-

29
00:01:10,103 --> 00:01:13,273
COST GENERICS WERE MADE, THE 

30
00:01:13,273 --> 00:01:14,507
MOST IN THE HISTORY OF THE 

31
00:01:14,507 --> 00:01:18,111
COUNTRY, THIS YEAR WE BEAT THAT 

32
00:01:18,111 --> 00:01:19,012
RECORD, APPROVING MORE 

33
00:01:19,012 --> 00:01:23,416
GENERICS, LEADING TO CHEAPER 

34
00:01:23,416 --> 00:01:24,284
COMPETITIVE ALTERNATIVES FOR 

35
00:01:24,284 --> 00:01:27,420
LIFE-SAVING DRUGS LIKE THE 

36
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:30,356
EPIPEN, SAVING ALMOST $9 

37
00:01:30,356 --> 00:01:35,528
BILLION A YEAR LAST YEAR ALONE. 

38
00:01:35,528 --> 00:01:36,262
SINCE RELEASING MY DRUG PRICING 

39
00:01:36,262 --> 00:01:38,264
BLUEPRINT IN MAY, 16 DRUG 

40
00:01:38,264 --> 00:01:40,833
COMPANIES REDUCED THEIR LIST 

41
00:01:40,833 --> 00:01:44,170
PRICES, ROLLBACK INCREASES OR 

42
00:01:44,170 --> 00:01:45,371
FROZE THEIR PRICES FOR THE REST 

43
00:01:45,371 --> 00:01:50,276
OF THE YEAR. 

44
00:01:50,276 --> 00:01:51,311
WE CALLED A FEW OF THOSE 

45
00:01:51,311 --> 00:01:52,011
COMPANIES RECENTLY, WHERE THEY 

46
00:01:52,011 --> 00:01:54,247
RAISED THE PRICES, I GUESS 

47
00:01:54,247 --> 00:01:55,481
MAYBE IT WAS ONE OF THE TIMES 

48
00:01:55,481 --> 00:01:56,315
THAT I REALIZED HOW POWERFUL 

49
00:01:56,315 --> 00:02:01,187
THE PRESIDENCY IS, BECAUSE THEY 

50
00:02:01,187 --> 00:02:02,054
IMMEDIATELY ROLLED THEIR PRICES 

51
00:02:02,054 --> 00:02:03,289
BACK TO WHERE THEY STARTED, AND 

52
00:02:03,289 --> 00:02:04,924
THOSE COMPANIES KNOW WHO WE ARE 

53
00:02:04,924 --> 00:02:06,259
TALKING ABOUT AND WE 

54
00:02:06,259 --> 00:02:09,362
APPRECIATED VERY MUCH. 

55
00:02:09,362 --> 00:02:10,630
I SIGNED TWO BILLS TO LOWER THE 

56
00:02:10,630 --> 00:02:12,999
COST OF PRESCRIPTION DRUGS, THE 

57
00:02:12,999 --> 00:02:18,638
KNOW THE LOWEST PRICE ACT, A 

58
00:02:18,638 --> 00:02:20,273
BIG THING, AND THE PATIENT 

59
00:02:20,273 --> 00:02:23,376
RIGHT TO KNOW ACT, PUT THEM 

60
00:02:23,376 --> 00:02:23,843
TOGETHER, YOU HAVE A 

61
00:02:23,843 --> 00:02:24,744
COMPLICATED DEAL. 

62
00:02:24,744 --> 00:02:27,280
IT SOUNDS CIVIL, BUT THAT IS 

63
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:30,550
NOT. 

64
00:02:30,550 --> 00:02:31,451
ENDING THE UNJUST GAG CLAUSES 

65
00:02:31,451 --> 00:02:33,453
ONCE AND FOR ALL, WHERE YOU GO 

66
00:02:33,453 --> 00:02:38,391
INTO A DRUGSTORE, AND THE 

67
00:02:38,391 --> 00:02:38,991
PHARMACIST WOULDN'T EVEN BE 

68
00:02:38,991 --> 00:02:39,959
ALLOWED TO TALK ABOUT 

69
00:02:39,959 --> 00:02:41,461
ALTERNATIVES OF PRICING, HOW 

70
00:02:41,461 --> 00:02:44,163
RIDICULOUS IS THAT, THAT IS NOT 

71
00:02:44,163 --> 00:02:45,965
GOING TO TAKE PLACE ANYMORE. 

72
00:02:45,965 --> 00:02:47,066
AND THE PHARMACISTS ARE VERY 

73
00:02:47,066 --> 00:02:51,804
HAPPY ABOUT IT. 

74
00:02:51,804 --> 00:02:53,106
PATIENTS HAVE THE RIGHT TO KNOW 

75
00:02:53,106 --> 00:02:55,508
THE LOWEST PRICE AND THE MOST 

76
00:02:55,508 --> 00:02:56,209
AFFORDABLE ALTERNATIVE AT THE 

77
00:02:56,209 --> 00:03:01,814
PHARMACY, TODAY, WE ARE HERE TO 

78
00:03:01,814 --> 00:03:02,381
ANNOUNCE ANOTHER BOLD AND 

79
00:03:02,381 --> 00:03:03,182
HISTORIC ACTION TO BRING DOWN 

80
00:03:03,182 --> 00:03:04,316
THE PRICE OF PRESCRIPTION 

81
00:03:04,316 --> 00:03:04,550
DRUGS. 

82
00:03:04,550 --> 00:03:06,953
WITH THE ACTION I AM UNVEILING 

83
00:03:06,953 --> 00:03:08,087
TODAY, THE UNITED STATES WILL 

84
00:03:08,087 --> 00:03:09,355
FINALLY BEGIN TO CONFRONT ONE 

85
00:03:09,355 --> 00:03:15,061
OF THE MOST UNFAIR PRACTICES, 

86
00:03:15,061 --> 00:03:16,195
ALMOST UNIMAGINABLE THAT IT HAS 

87
00:03:16,195 --> 00:03:18,965
NOT BEEN TAKING CARE OF LONG 

88
00:03:18,965 --> 00:03:22,835
BEFORE THIS, IT DRIVES UP THE 

89
00:03:22,835 --> 00:03:24,370
COST OF MEDICINE IN THE UNITED 

90
00:03:24,370 --> 00:03:26,172
STATES. 

91
00:03:26,172 --> 00:03:29,542
WE ARE TAKING AIM AT THE GLOBAL 

92
00:03:29,542 --> 00:03:30,610
FREELOADING THAT FORCES 

93
00:03:30,610 --> 00:03:32,111
AMERICAN CONSUMERS TO SUBSIDIZE 

94
00:03:32,111 --> 00:03:34,480
LOWER PRICES IN FOREIGN 

95
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:37,083
COUNTRIES THROUGH HIGHER PRICES 

96
00:03:37,083 --> 00:03:39,285
IN OUR COUNTRY. 

97
00:03:39,285 --> 00:03:45,425
I'VE SEEN IT FOR YEARS, I'VE 

98
00:03:45,425 --> 00:03:46,225
NEVER UNDERSTOOD IT, THE SAME 

99
00:03:46,225 --> 00:03:49,262
COMPANY, SAME BOX, SAME PILL, 

100
00:03:49,262 --> 00:03:50,530
MADE IN THE EXACT SAME 

101
00:03:50,530 --> 00:03:57,270
LOCATION, AND IN SOME COUNTRIES 

102
00:03:57,270 --> 00:03:58,171
IT WOULD BE 20% THE COST OF 

103
00:03:58,171 --> 00:03:59,438
WHAT WE PAY, AND IN SOME CASES 

104
00:03:59,438 --> 00:04:01,341
MUCH LESS THAN THAT, AND I SAY 

105
00:04:01,341 --> 00:04:05,178
WHY IS THIS, I DIDN'T KNOW THAT 

106
00:04:05,178 --> 00:04:06,846
I WOULD BE ABLE TO STAND BEFORE 

107
00:04:06,846 --> 00:04:11,351
YOU AND HAVE A CHANCE TO FIX 

108
00:04:11,351 --> 00:04:12,552
IT, THAT IS WHAT WE ARE DOING, 

109
00:04:12,552 --> 00:04:13,519
WE ARE FIXING IT, THAT'S CALLED 

110
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:14,287
REAL LIFE EXPERIENCE. 

111
00:04:14,287 --> 00:04:15,421
OTHER COUNTRIES HAVE RIGGED THE 

112
00:04:15,421 --> 00:04:17,190
SYSTEM SO THAT AMERICAN 

113
00:04:17,190 --> 00:04:21,661
PATIENTS ARE CHARGED MUCH MORE, 

114
00:04:21,661 --> 00:04:23,129
AND IN SOME CASES MUCH, MUCH 

115
00:04:23,129 --> 00:04:27,333
MORE FOR THE EXACT SAME DRUG. 

116
00:04:27,333 --> 00:04:31,938
AMERICANS PAY MORE SO THAT 

117
00:04:31,938 --> 00:04:32,738
OTHERS CAN PAY LESS, IT'S 

118
00:04:32,738 --> 00:04:40,380
WRONG, IT'S UNFAIR, TRADE DEALS,

119
00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:41,781
A COST MORE THAN EVEN THIS, WE 

120
00:04:41,781 --> 00:04:43,516
ARE CHANGING THEM ALSO. 

121
00:04:43,516 --> 00:04:44,851
FOREIGN COUNTRIES, EVEN 

122
00:04:44,851 --> 00:04:49,789
THREATENED TO DISRESPECT OUR 

123
00:04:49,789 --> 00:04:51,324
PATENTS IF THEY ARE NOT GIVEN 

124
00:04:51,324 --> 00:04:52,759
CHEAPER PRICES ON DRUGS, THEY 

125
00:04:52,759 --> 00:04:56,229
ARE NOT GOING TO EVEN LOOK AT 

126
00:04:56,229 --> 00:04:57,497
THE FACTS, THEY HAVE BEEN 

127
00:04:57,497 --> 00:05:00,066
DISRESPECTFUL -- DISRESPECTFUL 

128
00:05:00,066 --> 00:05:02,702
TO OUR COUNTRY. 

129
00:05:02,702 --> 00:05:05,538
AND TO ALL THE THINGS WE STAND 

130
00:05:05,538 --> 00:05:06,873
FOR. 

131
00:05:06,873 --> 00:05:08,708
AND ESPECIALLY DISRESPECTING 

132
00:05:08,708 --> 00:05:12,545
PATENTS, WHEN IT CAME TO 

133
00:05:12,545 --> 00:05:15,248
AMERICAN-MADE DRUGS. 

134
00:05:15,248 --> 00:05:18,351
EFFECTIVELY FUNDING RESEARCH 

135
00:05:18,351 --> 00:05:19,718
AND DEVELOPMENT FOR THE ENTIRE 

136
00:05:19,718 --> 00:05:29,495
PLANET, WE ARE PLAYING FOR -- 

137
00:05:29,495 --> 00:05:30,296
PAYING FOR, EVERYONE IS 

138
00:05:30,296 --> 00:05:31,197
BENEFITING, BUT THEY'RE PAYING 

139
00:05:31,197 --> 00:05:31,797
NOTHING TOWARDS RESEARCH AND 

140
00:05:31,797 --> 00:05:32,131
DEVELOPMENT. 

141
00:05:32,131 --> 00:05:39,138
THE WORLD REAPS THE RESULTS OF 

142
00:05:39,138 --> 00:05:39,772
AMERICAN GENIUS AND INNOVATION, 

143
00:05:39,772 --> 00:05:40,305
WHILE AMERICAN CITIZENS, 

144
00:05:40,305 --> 00:05:40,939
ESPECIALLY OUR GREAT SENIORS, 

145
00:05:40,939 --> 00:05:41,907
HIT THE HARDEST, PICK UP THE 

146
00:05:41,907 --> 00:05:43,976
TAB, BUT NO LONGER, HERE ARE 

147
00:05:43,976 --> 00:05:47,213
JUST A FEW EXAMPLES, FOR ONE I 

148
00:05:47,213 --> 00:05:48,247
MEDICATION THAT HELPS PREVENT 

149
00:05:48,247 --> 00:05:53,786
BLINDNESS, PAYING OVER $1 

150
00:05:53,786 --> 00:05:57,290
BILLION A YEAR. 

151
00:05:57,290 --> 00:05:59,826
IF WE PAY PRICES OTHER NATIONS 

152
00:05:59,826 --> 00:06:01,727
PAY, WE WOULD BRING $1 BILLION 

153
00:06:01,727 --> 00:06:06,032
DOWN TO $187 MILLION A YEAR. 

154
00:06:06,032 --> 00:06:07,266
PRETTY AMAZING, ISN'T IT? 

155
00:06:07,266 --> 00:06:10,603
WE SPEND MORE THAN $1 BILLION A 

156
00:06:10,603 --> 00:06:13,439
YEAR ON TWO DRUGS TO TREAT BONE 

157
00:06:13,439 --> 00:06:16,876
DISEASE, BUT WE COULD SAVE MORE 

158
00:06:16,876 --> 00:06:20,146
THAN $800 BILLION, THINK OF 

159
00:06:20,146 --> 00:06:22,982
THAT, $800 BILLION SAVINGS, FOR 

160
00:06:22,982 --> 00:06:26,386
OUR SENIORS, BY PAYING PRICES 

161
00:06:26,386 --> 00:06:28,855
THAT OTHER COUNTRIES PAY, 

162
00:06:28,855 --> 00:06:33,459
NOTHING SPECIAL, JUST THE 

163
00:06:33,459 --> 00:06:34,126
PRICES THAT OTHER COUNTRIES 

164
00:06:34,126 --> 00:06:36,362
PAY, THAT IS THE WAY THE UNITED 

165
00:06:36,362 --> 00:06:37,396
STATES HAS BEEN DISRESPECTED 

166
00:06:37,396 --> 00:06:39,365
FOR TOO LONG AND TOO MANY WAYS. 

167
00:06:39,365 --> 00:06:42,535
ONE COMMON CANCER DRUG IS 

168
00:06:42,535 --> 00:06:43,669
NEARLY 7 TIMES AS EXPENSIVE FOR 

169
00:06:43,669 --> 00:06:49,442
MEDICARE AS IT IS FOR OTHER 

170
00:06:49,442 --> 00:06:50,142
COUNTRIES. 

171
00:06:50,142 --> 00:06:51,777
A HIGHLY USED IN VERY EFFECTIVE 

172
00:06:51,777 --> 00:06:52,211
DRUG. 

173
00:06:52,211 --> 00:06:55,448
AND IT IS SEVEN TIMES MORE 

174
00:06:55,448 --> 00:06:56,382
EXPENSIVE. 

175
00:06:56,382 --> 00:07:00,153
NOT FAIR THIS HAPPENS BECAUSE 

176
00:07:00,153 --> 00:07:01,354
THE GOVERNMENT PAYS WHATEVER 

177
00:07:01,354 --> 00:07:04,223
PRICE THE DRUG COMPANIES SET, 

178
00:07:04,223 --> 00:07:05,390
WITHOUT ANY NEGOTIATIONS 

179
00:07:05,390 --> 00:07:08,694
WHATSOEVER, NOT ANYMORE. 

180
00:07:08,694 --> 00:07:11,697
UNDER OUR NEW PLAN, THE 

181
00:07:11,697 --> 00:07:12,331
DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN 

182
00:07:12,331 --> 00:07:15,034
SERVICES TO ALLOW MEDICARE TO 

183
00:07:15,034 --> 00:07:16,836
DETERMINE THE PRICE IT PAYS FOR 

184
00:07:16,836 --> 00:07:20,139
CERTAIN DRUGS, BASED ON THE 

185
00:07:20,139 --> 00:07:21,340
CHEAPER PRICES PAID BY OTHER 

186
00:07:21,340 --> 00:07:22,508
NATIONS. 

187
00:07:22,508 --> 00:07:27,446
SOME PEEPER -- PEOPLE CALL IT 

188
00:07:27,446 --> 00:07:33,653
FAVORED NATION STATUS, AND 

189
00:07:33,653 --> 00:07:34,520
CONTRACTS THAT I'VE BEEN A PART 

190
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:35,588
OF, FAVORED NATIONS, THINK OF 

191
00:07:35,588 --> 00:07:37,457
THAT, SO WE ARE PAYING A PRICE 

192
00:07:37,457 --> 00:07:39,458
BASED ON THE PRICE THAT OTHER 

193
00:07:39,458 --> 00:07:42,562
NATIONS ARE PAYING, NO LONGER 

194
00:07:42,562 --> 00:07:45,364
SEVEN TIMES MORE, NO LONGER 10 

195
00:07:45,364 --> 00:07:49,502
TIMES, 11 TIMES, EVEN 12 TIMES 

196
00:07:49,502 --> 00:07:50,302
MORE I'VE SEEN EXAMPLES PAYING 

197
00:07:50,302 --> 00:07:51,704
THE SAME PRICE, BILLIONS AND 

198
00:07:51,704 --> 00:08:03,082
BILLIONS OF SAVINGS TO PEOPLE. 

199
00:08:03,082 --> 00:08:04,116
WE WILL NO LONGER ACCEPT THE 

200
00:08:04,116 --> 00:08:04,817
INFLATED PRICES BEING CHARGED 

201
00:08:04,817 --> 00:08:05,317
TO OUR SENIORS. 

202
00:08:05,317 --> 00:08:06,118
I HAD A CONGRESSMAN, A 

203
00:08:06,118 --> 00:08:06,818
RESPECTED CONGRESSMAN, COME TO 

204
00:08:06,818 --> 00:08:07,853
THE OVAL OFFICE, AND SAY SIR, 

205
00:08:07,853 --> 00:08:11,290
FOR MY CONSTITUENTS, DRUG 

206
00:08:11,290 --> 00:08:12,658
PRICING IS MORE IMPORTANT THAN 

207
00:08:12,658 --> 00:08:13,859
HEALTHCARE. 

208
00:08:13,859 --> 00:08:15,094
AND I SAID EXPLAIN THAT TO ME, 

209
00:08:15,094 --> 00:08:19,865
BUT HE SAID DRUG PRICES, WE 

210
00:08:19,865 --> 00:08:21,400
KNOW HOW IMPORTANT HEALTHCARE 

211
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:24,837
IS, DRUG PRICING IS EVEN MORE 

212
00:08:24,837 --> 00:08:26,873
IMPORTANT FOR MY CONSTITUENTS. 

213
00:08:26,873 --> 00:08:30,042
AT LONG LAST, THE DRUG 

214
00:08:30,042 --> 00:08:30,776
COMPANIES IN FOREIGN COUNTRIES 

215
00:08:30,776 --> 00:08:32,245
WILL BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE FOR 

216
00:08:32,245 --> 00:08:35,313
HOW THEY READ THE SYSTEM 

217
00:08:35,313 --> 00:08:37,249
AGAINST AMERICAN CONSUMERS. 

218
00:08:37,249 --> 00:08:39,919
THIS IS A REVOLUTIONARY CHANGE, 

219
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:41,486
NOBODY HAS HAD THE COURAGE TO 

220
00:08:41,486 --> 00:08:43,456
DO IT, OR THEY JUST DID NOT 

221
00:08:43,456 --> 00:08:46,192
WANT TO DO IT. 

222
00:08:46,192 --> 00:08:47,827
AND THIS IS A CHANGE FOR THE 

223
00:08:47,827 --> 00:08:49,094
PEOPLE, NOT A CHANGE FOR 

224
00:08:49,094 --> 00:08:53,566
INDUSTRY, OR FOR COMPANIES, OR 

225
00:08:53,566 --> 00:08:57,503
FOR PHARMA, THIS IS A THE IT 

226
00:08:57,503 --> 00:08:59,839
WILL BE SUBSTANTIALLY THEY 

227
00:08:59,839 --> 00:09:04,510
REDUCTION IN DRUG PRICES FOR 

228
00:09:04,510 --> 00:09:05,878
OUR PEOPLE, AND OUR SENIOR 

229
00:09:05,878 --> 00:09:10,082
CITIZENS, TREMENDOUS DIFFERENCE.

230
00:09:10,082 --> 00:09:11,917
OUR PLAN WILL ALSO FIX A BROKEN 

231
00:09:11,917 --> 00:09:12,684
PAYMENT SYSTEM, WHERE DOCTORS 

232
00:09:12,684 --> 00:09:14,920
ARE REIMBURSED MORE IF THEY 

233
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:17,556
PRESCRIBE A MUCH MORE EXPENSIVE 

234
00:09:17,556 --> 00:09:21,394
DRUG, UNDER OUR NEW PROPOSED 

235
00:09:21,394 --> 00:09:24,430
PAYMENT SYSTEM, DOCTORS WILL BE 

236
00:09:24,430 --> 00:09:25,631
PAID A FLAT RATE, AND WHEN YOU 

237
00:09:25,631 --> 00:09:27,533
THINK OF IT, IT'S LIKE BEING A 

238
00:09:27,533 --> 00:09:35,274
CONTRACTOR, ANYTHING ELSE, IT'S 

239
00:09:35,274 --> 00:09:36,242
IS A EXPENSIVE DRUG OR LESS 

240
00:09:36,242 --> 00:09:37,243
EXPENSIVE DRUG, IT IS THE SAME, 

241
00:09:37,243 --> 00:09:40,546
IT IS AN ANYMORE. 

242
00:09:40,546 --> 00:09:41,747
I THINK THIS WILL BE GOOD IN 

243
00:09:41,747 --> 00:09:44,116
TERMS OF THE PRICING OF THE 

244
00:09:44,116 --> 00:09:45,384
DRUG, FANTASTIC FOR THAT, BUT 

245
00:09:45,384 --> 00:09:48,087
ALSO MUCH BETTER FOR PATIENTS, 

246
00:09:48,087 --> 00:09:51,524
AND IT MAY WELL BE BETTER FOR 

247
00:09:51,524 --> 00:09:53,158
DOCTORS. 

248
00:09:53,158 --> 00:09:53,825
THIS FOLLOWS OTHER SIGNIFICANT 

249
00:09:53,825 --> 00:09:54,960

250
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:57,263

SUBSTANTIALLY DOWN. 

267
00:10:44,844 --> 00:10:45,511
SADLY, A MAJORITY OF DEMOCRATS 

268
00:10:45,511 --> 00:10:46,512
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

269

SOCIALIST HEALTHCARE PLAN THAT

00:11:08,267 --> 00:11:12,571
MAKES NO SENSE ANY OTHER WAY, 

281
00:11:12,571 --> 00:11:15,474
WE REALLY THINK THAT COULD BE 

282
00:11:15,474 --> 00:11:16,976
BIPARTISAN. 

283
00:11:16,976 --> 00:11:17,977

REPUBLICAN IN THIS CASE, IT WAS 

287
00:11:23,215 --> 00:11:28,053
A DEMOCRAT.>>> UNDER THE SAID 

288
00:11:28,053 --> 00:11:28,821
MINISTRATION, WE WILL ALWAYS 

289
00:11:28,821 --> 00:11:29,588
