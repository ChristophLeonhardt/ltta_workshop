what he's going through 36 years ago this happened I had one beer right I had one beer well you think it was rooting up that was one beer oh good how did you get home I don't remember how'd you get there don't remember where is the place I don't remember how many years ago was it I don't know I don't know what neighborhood was it and I don't know where's the house I don't know upstairs Downstairs where was I don't know but I had one beer that's the only thing I remember there's there's no time in no place for remarks like that but to discuss something this sensitive that a political rally is just it's just not right it's just right I wish you hadn't done it just say it's it's kind of appalling that was Senator Jeff Flake earlier this morning reacting to president Trump's remarks at a rally last night in Mississippi and joining us now senior member of the Judiciary Committee Senate Democratic whip dick Durbin of Illinois senator it's good to be with you you put out a statement on Friday saying you would vote no on Cavanaugh this was before the FBI investigation was launched you pushed hard for an FBI investigation you push judge Cavanaugh during his testimony to commit to an investigation are you satisfied with the way the investigations been carried out so far and do you wish that the FBI agents would talk to both judge Cavanaugh and dr. Ford as they have not yet well of course they should speak to any relevant witness and that would include dr. Ford as well as judge Cavanaugh in terms of the course of the unit of the FBI investigation there isn't a single one of us who honestly knows what they're doing who they're speaking to we continue to get these anecdotal reports that people have tried to reach them with what they think might be important information they can't even get through so I just can't tell you where it stands I'm counting on chris ray and the FBI to do a professional job on behalf of an organization which we respect is the most important probably the best criminal investigation agency in the world when they are professionals as you know senators so what's the explanation you perceived or what can you surmise about why they wouldn't have interviewed the two key witnesses the two principals in this story and not carried out the investigation the way they would obviously they've been bridle a bit they've got to have this done by Friday but beyond that why wouldn't they interview those two people well I'll give you my theory my theory is that if dr. Ford is interviewed they necessarily have to interview judge Cavanaugh and those who are handling his nomination did not want him to be put into a position of having to explain some of the things which he said before the committee and so why would the FBI concede that point to the white house they wouldn't do it for anyone else they shouldn't they shouldn't concede it to anyone they were given a responsibility of a thorough professional nonpartisan investigation at the end of the day the future and the reputation of this agency is at stake you can you express concerns well before we even knew dr. Ford's name senator concerns about judge Cavanaugh in the area of presidential authority worried about how he might rule if the decision came to the Supreme Court regarding the Russia investigation I don't think you were satisfied with the answers you got during that questioning so I guess my question is even with dr. Ford now in the equation and these other accusations there wasn't really ever a chance you were gonna vote for judge Cavanaugh was there well of course I was leaning against him from the start and as the evidence started building up it became worrisome it wasn't just to the question of where he stood on privacy on the question of pre-existing conditions under our health care plans or women's rights it really came down to a fundamental question this is the wrong Supreme Court justice at this moment in history he has an extraordinary view that a president should be hands-off leaving the load don't investigate him now he has that view back in the Clinton era it was exactly the opposite at this moment in history we need a president to be held accountable this president doesn't want to be held accountable and he wants someone on the Supreme Court who agrees with him senator you just said that the apparent lack of questioning of people like dr. Ford and judge Cavanaugh what's the FBI's future and reputation and take those are your words you just said that and yet in this case the FBI is operating as a client of the white house of the general of the President's Council Dunn McGann so what your instinct about the white house is caring about the FBI's future and reputation given the fact that they have Milan and that the president has maligned the FBI for months now well it's not high on their priority list the highest priority of course is Brett Kavanaugh at any cost and the Senator McConnell has said we're going to plow through this FBI report if we have to we'll give members a little time to read it and let's go let's vote let's get it over with I think that is the priority we'd like to see the order that came from the White House that started the investigation with the FBI I don't think that's unreasonable let me just say one thing that I hope you'll reach back into your archives and find the opening statement in this conversation with the White House it came from Kellyanne Conway and it was about three weeks ago and she said two things that I remember very clearly first she said we are not going to ignore dr. Ford we are not going to insult dr. Ford look at what happened last night tell me that that was an insult to a woman who's trying to bring back her best most vivid memories one of the most horrible days in her life and a mock her at a political rally as a president did last night is certainly beneath the dignity of the white you weren't surprised though were you not at all the president held back after Kellyanne Conway's opening statement for about three days before he started the negative tweets and of course he's started piling up those tweets and all the comments and all the speeches since this is Eddie Glaude from Princeton I'm gonna use some morally charged language here but the Inspector General just released a report about children and folks who have been detained and it seems in moral and to my mind profoundly racist how do you hold someone accountable in this administration for what seems to me to be a very evil policy this inspector general's report tells us 2,700 children separated from their parents at the border a hundred and thirty-six as of this moment are still being held by this government separate from their pair I know one case personally I set in an immigration court room in Chicago and watched a four-year-old boy struggle to get the chair and play with with a matchbox car while his case was being considered by the court he's been separated from his mother for more than seven months he's reached the point he won't speak to her on the phone and they urge her to tell him to start eating he's not eating he's reverted to diapers though he's four years old this child's background and his psychology is being impacted by this experience it is unthinkable that we have not removed the secretary Nielson from the head of the DHS that was my question like how does she still sit in that position how does she not resign how does she not get fired the administration was warned plain and simple about the impact of family separations on children on families they were warned she signed off on the policy and she had that humiliating press conference or briefing with reporters defending it and speaking out of both sides of her mouth and yet these situation this fallout continued and she still sits there in her job we can let me tell you what the what the Inspector General came up with was that pre verbal children as they described them were being taken away from their parents and literally moved thousands of miles apart from their parents without any identification no plastic bracelet no fingerprints nothing move them through the system a system that had computers that could not even speak to one another and as a result many of these kids 29 of them at this point we have no idea where their parents are imagine that we have created these orphans at the border blank government policy it is time for secretary Nielsen to go yeah yeah senator durbin there are three branches in our government still the President of the United States it seems to me cannot by himself have such a heartless policy that that is causing irreparable harm to children who were being incarcerated what can you do what can the United States Senate do what should the United States federal court system be doing what should the state courts be doing I sky I cannot believe it's been going on this long and we still can't get the children reunited with their parents if a majority in Congress felt strongly Joe they could do something about it you know that from your own service in Congress but a majority happens to support the president at this moment and I can't quite understand that thank goodness the judicial branch through Judge Sarah in Southern California is coming to their aid and trying to find some way some humane way to bring this terrible chapter in American history to an end all right senator dick durbin thank you very much now the point I want to raise with you you look tired going there how long is it gonna take you to recover from a 13 inning one wild-card loss and winter begins for you people in Chicago today Mike all I've got to say is go bears in the morning watching the end of the Cubs 2019 season I think it looks okay Mike okay bears look good - yeah thank you very much senator for being on the show this morning a lot senator speaking of football still ahead inside the true origins of Donald Trump's gripe with the NFL dating back to the 1980s and how Trump's demands back then over quarterback Doug Flutie may have been a precursor to his calls for Mexico to pay for the wall are you with me what is that great story I had on warning generating story thanks for checking out MSNBC on YouTube and make sure you subscribe to stay up-to-date on the day's biggest stories and you can click on any of the videos around us to watch more 4 Morning Joe and MSNBC thanks so much for watching
