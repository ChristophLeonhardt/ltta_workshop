simpsons is amazing i mean it's it's i am the dumbest person in any room i'm an but particularly in that room it's a lot of Ivy league-educated really smart funny talented people who have this job that they just are creating what's become this iconic cultural fixture for almost 30 years and it's great it's people sitting around yelling stuff at each other and at a TV screen trying to get the next joke in to move us to the next joke and we do it every day for 50 weeks a year and crank out 20 episodes it's it's amazing I'd say every day there's a joke I'd go home with that it's like one of my favorites that somebody has pitched that's really funny a joke that I will that I can think of just at the spur of the moment is we had an episode once where I think Lisa was making a movie for the Sundance Slamdance Film Festival or some version of Sundance Film Festival and she was decided to film her own family and she was assigning roles and she said Homer you'll play yourself and then Homer said why because I'm fat so I thought that was funny in the course of a day we write without exaggeration a hundred fifty jokes go in the script and to get there we're pitching a thousand jokes so a lot of times at the end of a when we go back or when we talk about in the room who wrote that joke we can't even remember because often there's so many and often to get to the final joke that goes in the script it's kind of building upon to other people's pitches so it's it's hard I know that's not a satisfying answer one of many not satisfying answers today but it's hard to think of an individual joke that I've read most of people there we really are not employable anywhere else so we've stayed there for the for the bulk of our time but yeah I'd say there's a little bit of turnover but you know I've worked there 16 years and I'm middle-of-the-pack seniority wise our rookies have only worked there three years but there's people longer than me as well
