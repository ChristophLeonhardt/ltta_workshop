crates dot-com / Clavin man crates dot-com / : so at this point now the media is no longer reporting news if they ever were they're just selling a narrative and they're selling the narrative to both themselves and to us and the narrative is basically that Donald Trump is a dangerous authoritarian that he's trying to seize monarch achill power or dictatorial power wants to be a king or a dictator and that also that he's a racist I mean these two things are very important he's got a special animus toward black and brown people and because these media guys work in offices where everyone around them basically agrees with them and no one around them voted for Donald Trump they've sold themselves on they don't have to do very much to sell themselves on these narratives they sell the narratives and they just kind of assume that their interpretation of what Trump says is the right interpretation and then they just take it as given they take it as given that everybody must believe this is obvious to see because nobody around them is arguing with them and so they become this kind of myth making machine you know they hope they it's kind of like they both hope that it's true they believe that it's true and they hope they can convince you that it's true simply by accepting it I mean if I just go around say yeah everybody knows everybody knows he's a dictator and erases everything oh yeah that me it's obvious was that we you know he said this he said that I can just remember when he said the Nazis there were great people on the Nazi I heard it I actually heard a guy on MSNBC I think it was say you know Trump said they were really fine people on the side of the Nazi so I felt like you know my my basic feeling and I know this annoys some people my basic feeling is Trump is not a very good guy you know I write about this in my op-ed you know but he's been a very good president and on track to become possibly a great president when I say it's not a good guy you know he cheated on all his wives I've lost count of his wives and his insults people who don't deserve insulting he doesn't treat people with respect he's sold and bought into idiotic conspiracy theories and he sometimes has had a cynical lack of ethics but he is doing what he promised to do learning on the job he's appointed the best people just like he said he would I know the best people he knew the best people you know it was like he got it just right and he's stuck to his conservative governance which was another fear I add and it's all working I mean things are getting better in the country and he's making America great again I mean he's only the guy is a walking slogan and and so I think I think we should take a look i-i've just told you all the things that I don't like about Trump some of his behaviors as a human being you know we all pass judgments like this on each other but and as far as far as what he does for me for the pay that I give him through my tax dollars I think he's doing a terrific job right so I think we should take a look at this media narrative that is being sold that there's something really dangerous and authoritarian about him yesterday there really come over the weekend there's been this flap about whether Trump can pardon himself if he ever gets charged with any there's a big question of whether Trump can be indicted you know usually they say that the remedy of the bad behavior of the president is impeachment not indictment but Rudy Giuliani is on George sakalava kiss right and some luckiest asks him this question because they set these questions up they accept these questions up so we can all be shocked and he asked Giuliani what about this pardon you know you know in the Constitution very president has very broad pardoning power could he pardoned himself and here's what Giuliani said do you and the president's attorneys believe the president has the power to pardon himself he propped his not but he probably does I has no intention of pardoning himself but he probably doesn't say can't I mean that is another entry really interesting constitutional argument can the president pardon himself I run the partner journey it would be an open question I think it would probably get answered by gosh that's what the Constitution says and if you want to change it change it but yeah a lot of focus on the president I think the political ramifications of that would be tough pardoning other people is one thing pardoning yourself is another other presidents have pardoned people in circumstances like this both both in their administration and sometimes the next president even of a different party will come on and pardon so that's Rudy obviously talking off the top of his head as a lawyer about what it says in the Constitution and then when I want so of course the left starts going crazy Trump has to stir the pot he loves to get their goat and he try and he sends out a tweet as has been stated by numerous legal scholars I have the absolute right to pardon myself but why would I do that when I've done nothing wrong in the meantime their never-ending witch-hunt led by 13 very angry and conflicted Democrats and others continues into the midterms that's that's the president's tweet so this is the myth making machinery work this is just I just want to show you how this works right so that's what he said that's the question Trump echoes the question because he loves to start trouble the New York Times a former newspaper runs the headline Trump and his lawyers embrace a vision of vast executive power while no president has ever purported to pardon himself and is not clear whether might mr. Trump could legitimately take such a step the president's claim was the latest in an aggressive series of moves to assert his control over federal law enforcement last month mr. Trump crossed a traditional line he's always crossing the line they're always saying this I I know who draws these lines I think it's like a little old lady at the New York Times I I just drew it I think he crossed this line I drew that line he crossed it it's like it just wasn't there before last mile mr. Trump crossed a traditional line by ordering an investigation into the Russia investigators and late last year he boasted he has an absolute right to do what I want with the Justice Department so this is the way they do this right now the Constitution Giuliani is just reading the Constitution the Constitution says the President shall have power to grant reprieves and pardons for offenses against the United States except in the case of impeachment so if they're impeaching him he can't get out of it but you know this is something that he can do we don't we don't know it's such a broad statement right now when they pass that law by that when they may put that in the Constitution there were almost no federal crimes there were like three federal crimes and now the federal government has expanded so much that he can there's a lot more pardoned power in that so around the media this 1974 memo comes out because Nixon had floated the idea that he might be able to pardoned himself and they're saying oh no this memo from the Department of Justice this settles it this settles it he cannot pardoned himself because the woman who wrote it said that you can't serve as your own judge well no does it say that being pardoning people you're serving as your own judge it just says you're serving as the president and in this memo it actually says in the memo it actually says that the president could step down according to article 25 and then the Vice President could pardon him and then he could step back up and take his job again so the metal is all over the place I mean they're saying this as if it's true there was a there's a legal site called law and crime which is pretty even-handed it's that guy Dan Abrams who does media I and they say they had in 2017 they said could a future president Hillary Clinton pardon herself the short answer is she could certainly try and may get away with it what's more there's very likely little there's likely little Congress could do about it even with a republic controlled House of Representative my point my point is simply this it's an open question they asked him the question it's an open question Trump yes he's stirring up trouble but the thing with Trump is you cannot name a thing that he has done that is outside the law that is outside the rules of American governance unlike Obama who abused you know Victor Davis Hanson made this point today that Obama was classy but lawless and Trump is kind of crass but he follows the wall he follows the law the thing about Trump though is he's always in a negotiation and negotiation means movement you're always moving in a negotiation so what the press does is they take a snapshot of him he says yeah I can fire anybody I want Trump threatens to fire anybody want he's moving down the line because he just knows if he says that that's gonna get him going there's a political side to this I'll get to that in just a minute bull and first we got to talk about bowl and branch sheets I got about two hours of sleep last night I was wide awake all night long I was so glad to have my bowl and branch sheets because they're really really comfortable if you sleep in them

smart lady very honest hates Trump and she was on a special report and she says wow this is all just a ruse this this whole thing that Rudy Giuliani is saying is all just a political game here she is remember we're in the middle of a spin war of a political campaign that Rudy Giuliani is waging in in the press on behalf of Donald Trump at his request to spin things a certain way so as to form the opinions among Trump supporters and others and congressional Republicans who are supine and completely acquiescent so she doesn't like the Trump is playing politics with this investigation but the investigation is political we don't know how it began we don't know who started it we certainly when we compare it to the Hillary Clinton investigation where they didn't you know examine her computer to see how it was how it was hacked they didn't put her under oath when they talked to her you know when you compare that to the way they treated Donald Trump it's obviously a political hit in some sense a political hit they treated him very differently they've appointed the special counsel without any proof that there's a crime so they say well it's a cards that counterintelligence operation yeah that's it counterintelligence where they get to look for the crime it's obviously a political hit so Trump's fighting back he's fighting back but he has never done anything not one thing I dare any of these clowns to name one thing he's done that crosses the line into authoritarianism so he sounds course she sounds rough-and-tumble but he hasn't done anything that's really authoritarian so let's now I want to look at the racist thing you know Don Lemon I hate to mention him twice in two days because the guy I'm sure I'm the only person who ever watches them you know the guy just hates Trump and he's thinks he's very daring by calling him racist so he put out a montage of things that Trump has said and declared them all racist so let's let's listen to the full montage the president seems to think he's the victim here he thinks he deserves an apology even though he's never apologized for one word of this they're bringing drugs they're bringing crime they're rapists Donald J Trump is calling for a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States you also had people that were very fine people on both sides you had people in that group excuse me excuse me I saw the same pictures as you did when you loved to see one of these NFL owners when somebody disrespects our flag to say get that son of a job that field right now out he's fired he's fired that is pure racism and the president is cynically using that racism to appeal to his base we're learning tonight that in a phone call last fall with Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones the president said quote this is a very winning strong issue for me so that is one of the most cynical pieces of broadcasting I've ever heard right that is racism and his pure racism he says let's look at each one of those okay it says first he's bringing they're bringing drugs he's talking about illegal immigrants let's play the entire thing this was cut number 13 I spent a bigger chunk of it and Trump came back the next day and was interviewed about it so I'll follow it up with that interviews when Mexico sends its people they're not sending their best they're not sending you they're not sending you they're sending people that have lots of problems and they're bringing those problems with us they're bringing drugs they're bringing crime they're rapists and some I assume are good people now you've tried to clarify this statement in recent days ah no but I guess the question comes down to this do you regret saying that specifically about rapists or do you stand by it no not at all of course there did it it's not only Mexico if you let that run a little bit longer it talks about people coming from all over they're coming from all over they'll soon be coming and probably already have be coming from all over the world you're probably going to have people you're probably gonna have terrorists coming from the Middle East somebody said oh we don't have terrorists ever even know because they don't know who's coming so it's not about Mexicans it's about everybody's about the fact that when you leave the borders open anybody can come in and we don't know who they are it's also about the fact that the people who break the law are people who break the law and this is absolutely justified it has nothing to do with it didn't have any and he also said he said two things that show that it's not racist right he said they're not sending their best right so he's distinguishing beside between some people who were good people and some people who were bad people if they're breaking the law they're breaking the law and he said and some of them I assume are very good people so that's the entire quote it's taken out of context it obviously you know does anybody really think that Donald Trump's turn around sits around was lousy Mexicans I hate you no that's not what he saying this is shame that we are not enforcing our laws at the border all right let's look at the next one the Muslim ban obviously Islam is not a race I thought the Muslim ban was a stupid idea he set it off the top of his head it never was actually put out it hurt him when he was trying to put out a very sensible ban that actually was something that Obama had proposed earlier so Muslim ban a stupid idea but but the idea that Islam may be a problem in the West is a philosophical point it has nothing to do with race Islam is not a race there are Islamic people in Africa there are Islamic people in the Middle East or Islamic people in America it's not a race it's a philosophy and there's every reasonable cause to ask ourselves in the midst of a religion that is at war everywhere it has borders with people who are not Islamic and also at war against its own people it's perfectly rational to ask is there something about this philosophy that is inherently violent is there something about this philosophy that is inherently at odds with Western civilization not racist honk Don you're out of here all right third one and this is the big one okay because this is where he says there are good people on both sides and they do this again and again it has become a trope right that he was talking about the Nazis you remember Charlotte's ville a woman was killed by some kook right-winger all pry twin or whatever they they call him a bad guy and they just wanted him to come out and condemn them and he kept saying no wait some of these leftist showed up to fight as well let's listen to this full quote so you hear what he's really talking about as they're shouting him down and not letting him get a word in edgewise but you also had people that were very fine people on both sides you had people in that group excuse me excuse me I saw the same pictures as you did you had people in that group that were there to protest the taking down of to them a very very important statue and the renaming of a park from Robert eleaf to another name he is clearly when he says this it really bugs me because this is the one they seized on I I admit it was a little tone deaf when somebody's just been murdered you want to address that first and foremost but they they seized on this she's obviously talking about the people who were protesting the taking down of statues when he says they're fine people on both sides what he means is on the size of the on in the argument of whether you take these statues down of robert e lee because he was defending the confederacy or you keep it up because he's a historical person and he acted in his time he didn't see things from our point of view it's ridiculous to go back and judge him from our point of view he's saying on that on those arguments and and protests and marches they were fine people on both sides which no doubt is exactly literally true it is taken out of context it is absolutely unfair by the way I'm only dealing with things that he has said while he's president because again that's when he works for me if Lenin had actually wanted to go after him for something that was morally wrong he should have gone after in that campaign when they asked him to disavow the Ku Klux Klan and it took him a day to do it that was morally wrong but not racist he wasn't adopting the philosophy of the Ku Klux Klan it was just cynical politics he didn't want to lose those voters he knew there were some voters who were sympathetic with that he didn't want to alienate them that's a moment you have to speak up and he didn't do it that was a mortal error but the moral error was political cynicism not racism and finally this thing with the NFL he's talking about people disrespecting the flag and when he says you just the way lemons did that he said it's pure racism he says this is a winning issue for me this is a big winning as if he meant attacking black people or being racist he's talking about people not saluting the flag and he was right it is a winning issue for him because we want people especially people who have done so well in our country to pay attention and you know be just a little bit grateful that's all we ask if they're gonna ask us for our money and our agile ation and for fame just a little bit gracious about the country that has given them so much it's mythology and they sell it and then they just assume it has been proven and sold and it truly is not fair as I started out by saying this I have print plenty of problems with Trump but racism and authoritarianism are not the problems I have I've been watching him I was worried about authoritarian terian ISM when he took office but he has in no way violated any of the norms of American governance it really is just a narrative they're peddling has nothing to do with the news they ought to get down to that let's talk about movement or as I like to

I'd like to talk about this the masterpiece Katie how you doing Jenna thank you for coming I'm great thank you so much for having me Andrew it's a privilege to be with you today so let's let's talk just lay this case out this is a gay couple went to a Christian cake baker in Colorado asked him for cake for their wedding did they search him out or did they just wander in off the street you know the record is not clear on whether or not this was targeted as far as the record contains they the couple was recommended to go to Jack Phillips he's a well-known a creative artisan and so while they did travel quite a distance it was based on a recommendation and I don't think that either side stipulated that this was necessarily targeting Jack specifically okay and Jack Phillips his name is now and what did Phillips what was Philips response so when he found out that this was going to be for the ceremony of a so-called gay wedding he said listen I make all kinds of cakes on the end you are welcome to purchase anything that's pre bought in the store but I cannot use my creative skills and talents to make a custom design and notably Jack had also turned away other types of cakes including Halloween cakes divorce cakes things that would be more adult themed cakes so this wasn't specifically him either targeting the gay couple either he said this is just something that according to my sincerely held religious beliefs I can't do this and so he declined them on that basis and I think it's also important to note that he didn't decline the individual based on their sexual orientation had for example one of the two gentlemen's mothers come in who is you know a heterosexual female had she come in and asked for a custom cake to be served at a reception at a gay wedding he would have said the same thing so it was about the product and the service not the individual so that's kind of amazing he was he had also turned down cakes for Halloween and for you know adult themes thing he just said you know you can buy if they come in and there have been a wedding cake sitting there he wouldn't mind it he just didn't want to create the thing for them that was violating his conscience in terms of freedom okay and he was willing to serve anything to anyone that was pre bought and pre-made and that was very clearly articulated and oral argument from Alliance defending freedom that represented masterpiece cake shop wow that's that's pretty amazing I had not realized that it went it was that narrower thing so now the the there's a commission right this is not a this is just a commission that studies violations of Rights and they come after the guy is that fair yeah and in this commission I'm from Colorado and I've been very involved in terms of testifying for the reauthorization of this particular Commission because what a lot of people don't realize is that this is just a quasi judicial body that comes out of the department of regulatory agencies in Colorado so the executive branch they're not part of the judicial branch none of these seven members are even they don't even have to be attorneys yet they're making findings and conclusions of law based just on their affiliation with a potentially discriminated against class so currently they're appointed by the governor confirmed by the Senate to their term and at least a majority or four of them out of the seven have to be members of one of the potentially discriminated against classes which sets up this ability to basically stack the Commission with LGBT either members or associations or some type of affiliation and sympathy and that's exactly what happened in 2012 when Jack's case went to this commission and the due process thing about this it's crazy because Jack didn't have the ability to opt out Colorado law allowed Craig and Mullins to file their claim in a regular court or take it in front of the Commission well who are you gonna pick when a commission is so clearly biased yet the respondent the person who is targeted by this has no ability to opt out and say wait a minute I want a duly authorized judge so this isn't a this is an appalling abuse of power this is incredible I if so as I understand it he goes before the Commission at least one of the guys on the Commission compares it says this is the kind of thing that you that caused the Holocaust he says the religion was used to you know to rationalize the Holocaust which I'm not even sure this is true I can't think of anybody rationalizing I'm sure there were religious people who did so so he's obviously biased against the guy plot plus is this right that the Commission had previously allowed people to deny make to refuse to make cakes that were anti-gay is that true yes and so another Christian named Bill Jack and he's part of he heads up the worldview Academy he's also a Christian heard about this case and said wait a second there's some inconsistencies going on so he went to three separate bakeries and asked those Baker's to put to bake a cake with the verse and Leviticus for example that talks about how homosexuality is a sin and the Commission said no no those cake bakers don't have to participate in that kind of speech it goes against their conscience but yet they said that Jack Phillips had to create a custom design so you see this hypocrisy and this very clear bias and animus from the Commission against a Christian specifically and pro-lgbt is agenda this this is amazing so they're very clearly regulating speech now they go before the Supreme Court and this it's a seven to two decision that lets Phillips off the hook but it's really narrow I mean what what exactly did they say what what's the decision yes and although this was heavily litigated by Twitter yesterday to say what is a narrow decision mean when it's the opinion was narrow the vote was not and so in legal speak what it means is basically the court punted the court said we don't want to get into this because it was perfect facts to show this this person Jack Phillips he had absolutely no bias there animus against his customers he had a track record of declining other types of cakes that he disagreed with their message I mean his logo even has an artist palette and he clearly understands his cakes to be speech and yet the court said we are going to very very narrowly meaning we're only going to take a fact-based opinion and say just because the Commission treated Jack was such open hostility comparing him to the Holocaust which was terrible but they said just based on the facts we're going to overturn this hand Jack the win by any margin but we're not gonna get any guidance or any clarifying principle for future artists I mean how do we know how the florists in Washington how the videographers how the t-shirt makers how other creative professionals what are they supposed to do now with this opinion this gave no guidance to other courts how to interpret other artistic professionals who may not want to participate in these types of religious ceremonies it's quite amazing in other words if the committee if the Colorado committee had managed to hide its anti religious prejudice if it had buried this and kept their mouth shut they basically might have gotten away with this they may had and that was what I found so disappointing about Kennedy's opinion for the majority is that he is just inviting future litigants to hide their animus and basically just be sneakier about it and say we're not gonna go on the record comparing you to the Holocaust we are going to pretend to be very kind to you and we're still going to find that you've breached the anti-discrimination law for public accommodation we're just gonna do it in a stealthy manner and then get up to the Supreme Court or whatever court in Colorado of course still has this clear bias and we just won't have it as openly so it's just inviting people to be sneakier about it unfortunately it I mean it's pretty you know when I heard that it was 72 I kind of thought that's that's really great but then it what it's bothers me that there are two judges is Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Sotomayor I think who there's two judges who basically felt he should have been nailed anyway it didn't matter guy has got he's not only got to it's not not enough that gay people have the right to get married everybody has to agree that this is a wonderful thing is that pretty fair fairly what they said yeah and you know amazing about this is that Ginsburg and Sotomayor I mean for how just fact base and clear this was that there was such hostility against jack by the Commission it's amazing to me that Ginsburg and Sotomayor didn't just join this and make it a nine zero because now they're clearly showing their animus and they're showing that they have a clear bias for the LGBT agenda by not joining in this opinion and I found that really surprising that they that they were willing to do that and not just say you know what we'll give him the win in this instance so we can come back later and say hey listen we were fair to Jack Phillips so now we're gonna stick it to the Christian community they can't say that now and we will always have that opinion for that reason you know what's so disturbing to me about this is that you know I'm on to the left of the Dobson Institute dearly as I love them you know I know I mean I'm an artist I've worked with gay people all my life I want them to live and be happy I don't want to pasture I it's not for me to tell them how to live you know but but this really does seem when when Institute's like the James Dobson Institute talk about the gay agenda they're talking about what seems to be a target on religious people a target on family certain kinds of family life traditional family life and a target on free speech and this kind of justifies them that there is this element in the gay community yeah and you dr. Dobson has been speaking for 40-plus years about the prevalence through the rise of the sexual revolution for things like abortion that have led to even more cases like Planned Parenthood versus Casey Roe versus Wade eventually getting into obergefell because remember we didn't find some kind of constitutional right in that emanates from the vast penumbra what the Court did in Roe vs. Wade is find a a right to privacy that somehow is extended to cover other traditionally unlawful and criminal and definitely immoral activity and that's what we've seen throughout the past 50 or 60 years and that was really the foundation of the obergefell decision because remember injury I mean the law in all of the states which by definition is a state sovereignty issue the the federal government cannot legislate on marriage or domestic relations period because of article 1 section 8 so not only is this a state issue but the states had spoken and said we are only going to recognize marriage between one man and one woman that was equally the apply different everyone had the opportunity to marry someone of the opposite sex and so and yet the LGBT agenda has not only said we want equality but now they want celebration they want participation they want Jack Phillips they want you and me to be compelled to celebrate and to speak in support of their message and that's why it's so dangerous and why people like dr. Dobson and also our policy center with the Dobson Family Institute are making sure that we are protecting and preserving the fundamental rights that are political they don't come from the Constitution they come from our Creator and our declaration recognizes that our Constitution is just supposed to preserve and protect that it is it is really amazing because a lot of people have a right to do a lot of things but to legislate that I have to agree with them or celebrate what they do is absurd I mean it's just it truly is a an abrogation of my rights just a free thought let alone free speech I what did one of the conservatives guys like Gorsuch and Thomas say what was their opinion yeah I wish that Thomas's concurrence which was joined by Gorsuch there's only two members of the court they actually went into the free speech issue and said that Jack should have won not just on this procedural issue but really on the merits and so they gave a very very solid explanation of why this case should have been more broad and why the court should have commented on the protections that we find in the First Amendment and so I wish that justice Thomas's opinion had spoken for the majority here that's but hopefully we'll see that in future cases it's a man it's amazing I'm really glad you came on because I have to say it's worse than I thought it's a real violation I mean it's I'm glad he didn't get uh nailed by the court but it's still a terrible violation of our free speech rights Jenna Ellis the author of the legal basis for a moral Constitution a guide for Christians to understand America's current constitutional crisis I would really like to hear more about this bide like to read it and I'd like to talk to you about it again I hope you'll come back yes please thank you so much for having me thanks a lot John Wow yeah what is wrong with these guys you know they've just met I think you know it's like people are beginning to accept gay people I think that's getting to be a very broadly held opinion they're just making they're just wrong footing that they're just making themselves you know anathema it's just it's just so ugly and bullying and unamerican it really is embarrassed for them I really am which brings us by natural segue to sexual follies I'm sorry I still love watching ya I'm easy to entertain I think hey so this is this has got a when I talk about Follies this has got to be right up there on the stupid ladder I mean you go up the rung of the stupid ladder you know you get about halfway up you get there like Don Lemon and Chris Cuomo this goes a couple of runs above this Miss America the pageant where that we all know as the bikini the or as we call it the bikini contest right is scrapping its swimsuit competition and will no longer judge contestants based on physical appearance they announced Tuesday this is gretchen carlson we remember her cause she was a news lady on Fox News who complained that Roger Ailes I think was chasing around the desk right and it wasn't that the one yeah but she is herself a former Miss America and she is now heading the Miss America Organization and she came on and explained what this what this contest is going to be like now at ten we will no longer judge our candidates on their outward physical appearance that's huge that's human that means that we will no longer have a swimsuit competition and that is official as of September 9th when we have our competition in Atlantic City will also be revamping our evening gown competition phase as well and so we're no longer judging women when they come out in their chosen attire their evening wear whatever they choose to do it's going to be what comes out of their mouths that we're interested in when they talk about their social impact initiative women of all shapes and sizes because typically we see swimsuit ready bodies up on that stage we want to be open transparent inclusive to women who may not have felt comfortable participating in our program before but look we have always had talent and scholarship and we need to message that part of the program better as well but now we're adding in this new caveat that we're not going to judge you on your outward appearance because we're interested in what makes you you it's like well I don't know you if you're not watching it's two beautiful women talking to each other with a big pan and pictures of women in bikinis behind to make sure that we're watching the thing because where we get let me tell you why this isn't huge I mean first of all it's the end of the Miss America pageant nobody will care about but journalists journalists will use it as a kind of big story but it won't get any ratings nobody's gonna sit around and watch a bunch of women compete for intellectual prizes nobody cares that's that's the first thing but secondly it is so anti life it is so anti joy it is so stupid female beauty is a human good it is a thing that gives people joy it is a thing that makes the world more joyful in the same way that male bravery is a good and you can say well isn't bravery good for women and tractor that's good for men yes but it's not the same thing beauty is a feminine good and bravery is a masculine good that is the way it works and there are all kinds of reasons for that namely because you want to know that the woman you want to know that the race is going to continue you want to know that the woman can attract a man to father a child you want to know that the father can be brave enough to defend the child that is what is all about that's why they're good now they are not virtues right they are not virtues beauty is a good but because it brings joy and it continues the race but it's not a virtue you can be evil and be beautiful you can be evil and be brave yeah you know somebody with that horrible louis frock and once said that Hitler was a brave soldier he said it because he hates Jews but in fact it's a factual truth but Hitler was indeed a iron cross brave soldier he but he was also a satanic evil man right so it you can be brave and you can be beautiful but that makes it all the more impressive when a human good like female beauty or male bravery is also imbued with virtue when a man is brave on on behalf of a good cause or when a woman brings to her beauty kindness and modesty and virtue and you know virtue and her treating herself with respect and to appreciate this is to love life that is what it is like to love life when you walk down the street glad that women are beautiful and glad that beautiful women are good and glad that men can be brave and clad that some brave men are also good that is what it is to love life that is what loving life looks like and to try and suck that out for a false sense of envy and a false sense of virtue and a false sense of what matters in life is believed to suck the joy out of life that's all it is look at the Miss America contest was always just a commercial enterprise it's always been a goofy little thing but to take away from it what made it at least fun in its stupid little way is just as stupid at mean really you would have to put Don Lemon and Chris Cuomo together to get that dumb I mean that's how that's how dumb it is talk about sexual follies all right remember the mailbag is tomorrow so this is the last day on which you have to have personal
