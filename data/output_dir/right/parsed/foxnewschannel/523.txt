STEVE: TODAY THEY ARE
LOOKING AT THE ALLEGATIONS
OF DR. CHRISTINE FORD.
DAVID BOSSIE JOINS US RIGHT
NOW FROM OUR NATION'S
CAPITAL, I DO BELIEVE.
DAVID, WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF
WHAT IS GOING ON?
>> WELL, THIS IS A
DISGUSTING SMEAR, A VERY
GOOD MAN BRETT KAVANAUGH.
IT IS REALLY TROUBLING TO
SEE ON MANY LEVELS WHAT THEY
ARE DOING TO BRET'S FAMILY
AND HIS REPUTATION.
BUT, ALSO WHAT THEY ARE
DOING TO FUTURE VICTIMS OF
REAL ASSAULT, WHAT THEY ARE
DOING IS USING A POLITICAL
CUDGEL AGAINST A POLITICAL
OPPONENT BUT HAVING REAL
LIFE IMPACT ON FUTURE
VICTIMS.
THIS IS A DISGUSTING DISPLAY
BY DEMOCRATS THAT I -- YOU
KNOW, I THINK WE ARE
UNFORTUNATELY GOING TO SEE
REPERCUSSIONS OF THIS
FOREVER.
NOT ONLY IN SUPREME COURT
NOMINATIONS BUT OUR POLITICS
IN GENERAL.
SO IT'S VERY STUREB
DISTURBING.
AINSLEY: DAVID, IT'S
UNFORTUNATE IF HE IS IN A
SENSE HIS REPUTATION IS
TAINTED.
MANY PEOPLE ARE ASKING NOW
IS THERE ENOUGH TIME NOW
BETWEEN NOW AND THE MID
TERMS IF THEY DECIDE NOT TO
VOTE HIM IN, IS THERE ENOUGH
TIME FOR REPUBLICANS TO
BRING IN SOMEONE NEW AND
VOTE ON SOMEONE ELSE FOR THE
SUPREME COURT?
>> YOU KNOW, I DON'T THINK
THAT THAT'S GOING TO BE
NECESSARY.
I THINK BRETT KAVANAUGH IS
GOING TO ACQUIT HIMSELF VERY
WELL TODAY.
UP AGAINST THESE, JUST
UNFOUNDED SMEAR TACTICS BY
THESE OUT-OF-TOUCH
DEMOCRATS.
AND I THINK THAT IT'S GOING
TO BE IMPORTANT FOR OUR BASE
TO WAKE UP AND UNDERSTAND
WHAT IS GOING ON AND THE
RAMIFICATIONS OF LOSING IN
NOVEMBER AND WE HAD BETTER
TURN OUT TO THE POLLS
BECAUSE THAT IS GOING TO BE
THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE
TRUMP AGENDA CONTINUING AND
ENDING.
IT'S ON ELECTION DAY IN THE
MID TERMS.
BRIAN: NO QUESTION, DAVID.
THE BASE SEEMS TO HAVE WOKEN
UP FOR THE ADMINISTRATION.
THE BASE ISN'T GOING TO BE
ENOUGH.
YOU HAVE TO WAKE UP THE
PEOPLE WHO ARE NOT AS
POLITICALLY INVOLVED AS US
ON THE COUCH AND YOU OVER
THERE IN THE STUDIO.
SO, WHAT DO YOU THINK PEOPLE
ON THE OUTSIDE, WHO AREN'T
GOING TO DIVE INTO THESE
STORIES LIKE WE ARE, WHAT DO
YOU THINK THEY ARE THINKING
RIGHT NOW WHO OFTEN HAVE
SONS AND DAUGHTERS?
>> THAT'S RIGHT.
AND I HAVE BOTH.
I KNOW MANY DO.
BRIAN: AS DO I.
>> YES.
IT IS VERY TROUBLING TO
WATCH THIS ENTIRE EPISODE.
I'VE GOT TO TELL YOU THAT
BRETT KAVANAUGH, JUST AS AN
EXAMPLE, YOUR AVERAGE
PERSONAL IS LOOKING AT THESE
OUTLANDISH, JUST DISGUSTING
ALLEGATIONS OF A GANG RAPE.
LOOK, THIS MAN WAS THE
NUMBER THREE PERSON IN KEN
STARR'S OPERATION
INVESTIGATING THE MONICA
LEWENSKI SEXUAL ASSAULT OF
BILL CLINTON.
THE CLINTON WAR MACHINE TOOK
DOWN EVERY SINGLE PERSON IN
THE 1990S WHO WAS ASSOCIATED
WITH THAT INVESTIGATION AND
THIS NEVER CAME OUT?
15 YEARS AFTER HIS HIGH
SCHOOL FINISHED.
AFTER HE LEFT HIGH SCHOOL.
CLOSER THAN IT IS TODAY.
AND HE WAS INVOLVED IN THE
HIGHEST SEX CRIME ALLEGATION
IN MODERN AMERICAN HISTORY
AND NOTHING CAME OUT BACK
THEN.
THIS IS RIDICULOUS.
THEY DESTROYED EVERYBODY WHO
WAS INVOLVED IN THAT
INVESTIGATION COLLINS WAR
MACHINE TOOK NO PRISONERS
AND BRETT KAVANAUGH WOULD
HAVE BEEN PAID BACK FOR
THIS.
IT IS OUTRAGEOUS AND NO
TRUTH TO IT.
I THINK BRET IS GOING TO DO
VERY WELL TODAY AND WE HAVE
HIM IN THE SUPREME COURT
SOON.
STEVE: YOU ARE REFERRING TO
THE BILL CLINTON WAR
MACHINE.
BRIAN FALLON WAS PART OF THE
HILLARY CLINTON WAR MACHINE,
CAMPAIGN ADVISOR.
HE IS QUOTED AS SAYING THIS:
SAVING THE SUPREME COURT
FROM TRUMP'S CLUTCHES HAS
ALWAYS INVOLVED A VERY
COMPLICATED TWO-STEP.
FIRST, BLOCK KAVANAUGH,
WHICH THEY ARE TRYING RIGHT
NOW.
THEN FIGHT LIKE HELL TO WIN
BACK THE SENATE.
IF KAVANAUGH DROPS OUT, WE
ARE HALFWAY THERE.
IF DEMOCRATS ARE ABLE TO WIN
BACK THE SENATE, WE WOULD
HAVE A PATH TO BLOCKING
TRUMP FROM PICKING ANY OF
THE ARCH CONSERVATIVES ON
HIS SHORT LIST IS THAT WHAT
WE ARE SEEING RIGHT NOW?
>> IT'S EXACTLY THEIR
TACTICS.
THANK YOU, BRIAN, FOR
TELLING THE AMERICAN PEOPLE
EXACTLY WHAT YOUR MOTIVES
ARE.
THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT.
THAT'S WHY THESE MID TERMS
HAVE CONSCIOUS SEQUENCES.
I HAVE GOT TO TELL YOU WHEN
I GET A CHANCE TO INFLUENCE
POTENTIALLY THE NEXT SUPREME
COURT NOMINEE, THE GLOVES
ARE GOING TO BE OFF HERE.
EVERY A HISTORY IN THIS
COUNTRY OF PRESIDENTS
REPLACING IDEOLOGICAL SEATS
WITH VERY CLOSE IDEOLOGICAL
PEOPLE.
SO, IF JUSTICE GINSBURG OR
JUSTICE BREYER WERE TO
LEAVE, PRESIDENT TRUMP WOULD
HISTORICALLY REPLACE
SOMEBODY WHO IS CLOSE
IDEOLOGICALLY, NOT
NECESSARILY AS FAR AS LEFT
BUT SOMEBODY WHO WAS MORE
MODERATE OR EVEN A LIBERAL.
I THINK THOSE DAYS ARE GONE
AND I THINK THEY ARE GOING
TO BE PAID BACK FOR IT IN
DEVASTATING TERMS.
BRIAN: BROAD STROKES.
DAVID, IF BRETT KAVANAUGH IS
GUILTY OF THIS, HE DOESN'T
BELONG ON THE BENCH.
BUT THE ONLY WAY TO FIND OUT
IS TO QUESTION THESE
ACCUSERS.
HOW DO YOU DO THAT AND NOT
LOOK LIKE A BULLY OR COME
OFF AS SOMEBODY QUESTIONING
SOMEBODY SEXUAL ASSAULT.
>> THAT'S A DIFFICULT THING.
AND THAT'S WHY CHAIRMAN
GRASSLEY WAS SO SMART IN
BRINGING IN SOMEBODY WHO IS
EXPERIENCED AT THIS.
LOOK, THERE IS A BUNCH OF
UNITED STATES SENATORS WITH
A LOT OF DIFFERENT
EXPERIENCES BOTH REPUBLICAN
AND DEMOCRAT.
BUT NONE OF THEM HAVE THE
EXPERIENCE OF THE PROSECUTOR
THEY ARE BRINGING IN THAT
WILL BASICALLY PROD BRETT
KAVANAUGH AND DR. FORD IN
THEIR MEMORY, IN THEIR
BACKGROUND, WHAT THEY ARE
ABLE TO SAY AS FACT AND THE
WHAT THEY THINK THEY
BELIEVE.
AND THAT IS A VERY IMPORTANT
THING FOR THE AMERICAN
PEOPLE TO SEE.
BUT A SEASONED PROSECUTOR IS
GOING TO KNOW VERY SERIOUSLY
WHERE THE BOUNDARIES ARE.
AND THAT IS VERY IMPORTANT.
IT IS A THEATER, THAT'S WHAT
THIS IS.
BRIAN: I HOPE NOT.
>> WE SAW WITH BRETT
KAVANAUGH AND WHAT THE
SENATE DEMOCRATS DID WITH
BRETT KAVANAUGH IN A OPEN
HEARING WHEN WE HAD
SPARTACUS MOMENTS.
BY THE WAY, THIS IS AN
ADMITTED GROPER WHO IS NOW
SPARTACUS.
BRIAN: CORY BOOKER.
>> IT'S OUTRAGEOUS THAT HE
WOULD DO THAT IN THAT
HEARING SETTING.
I CAN'T IMAGINE WHAT THESE
PEOPLE WILL DO TODAY.
AINSLEY: CHUCK GRASSLEY
HOPES TO PREVENTS THAT AND
PREVENT A CIRCUS-LIKE
SITUATION.
BRIAN: NOT MUCH PRESS.
>> IT TAKES COMMON DECENCY
AND I HAVEN'T SEEN MUCH OF
