1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,689
senator Sanders joins us now from his
home state of Vermont senator Sanders

2
00:00:03,689 --> 00:00:06,720
I'll get the taxes in just a minute but
first I want to ask you about Puerto

3
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:11,429
Rico what did you make of President
Trump tweeting that Puerto Ricans quote

4
00:00:11,429 --> 00:00:19,109
want everything to be done for them you
know speaking from his fancy Golf Club

5
00:00:19,109 --> 00:00:23,420
playing golf with his billionaire
friends attacking the mayor of San Juan

6
00:00:23,420 --> 00:00:28,349
who was struggling to bring electricity
to the island food to the island water

7
00:00:28,349 --> 00:00:33,390
to the island gas to the island that is
just it is unspeakable and I don't know

8
00:00:33,390 --> 00:00:38,190
what world Trump is living in people in
Puerto Rico are suffering one of the

9
00:00:38,190 --> 00:00:42,600
worst disasters in the history of that
island we have got to do everything we

10
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:46,730
can to help them we all have got to
remember the people of Puerto Rico are

11
00:00:46,730 --> 00:00:51,510
American citizens entitled to the same
help as the people of any other

12
00:00:51,510 --> 00:00:54,960
community in America and the White House
denies it but there are a lot of critics

13
00:00:54,960 --> 00:01:00,500
who say that race or ethnicity might be
playing a factor here what do you think

14
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:08,460
well look given the president's history
on race given the fact that he a few

15
00:01:08,460 --> 00:01:13,049
months ago told us that they were good
people on both sides when neo-nazis were

16
00:01:13,049 --> 00:01:18,479
marching in charlottesville yeah I think
we have a right to be suspect that he is

17
00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:22,110
treating the people of Puerto Rico in a
different way than he has treated the

18
00:01:22,110 --> 00:01:26,310
people of texas or Florida let's turn to
the president's tax plan the president

19
00:01:26,310 --> 00:01:30,119
wants to double to the standard
deduction so that a married couple won't

20
00:01:30,119 --> 00:01:34,680
pay any taxes on the first twenty four
thousand dollars of income is that a

21
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:39,869
provision of the president's tax plan
that you might be able to support it is

22
00:01:39,869 --> 00:01:43,890
but overall I just listened to mr.
Mulvaney who says that nobody can make

23
00:01:43,890 --> 00:01:49,170
an analysis long-term of what this tax
proposal does he's wrong the Tax Policy

24
00:01:49,170 --> 00:01:55,710
Institute has said that 80% Jake at the
end of ten years 80% of the benefits

25
00:01:55,710 --> 00:02:00,810
will go to the top one percent so it's
not just that they want to repeal the

26
00:02:00,810 --> 00:02:07,439
estate tax which benefits only the top
two-tenths of one percent families like

27
00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:11,849
the Walton family or the Koch brothers
family will receive tens and tens of

28
00:02:11,849 --> 00:02:15,480
billions of dollars in tax
pricks for Trump to go on televisions

29
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:18,960
that oh this doesn't benefit the wealthy
is absolutely outrageous

30
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:23,640
of course it benefits the wealthy and of
course it benefits large multinational

31
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:28,740
corporations right now we are living in
a moment of massive income and wealth

32
00:02:28,740 --> 00:02:32,820
inequality the very very rich are
getting richer middle class is shrinking

33
00:02:32,820 --> 00:02:37,590
what this tax proposal does is not only
give huge tax breaks to the wealthy and

34
00:02:37,590 --> 00:02:44,040
large corporations it cuts Medicare by
four hundred and fifty billion dollars

35
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:48,720
some listeners some viewers may remember
the Trump campaign oh I'm not going to

36
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:53,370
touch Medicare four hundred and fifty
billion dollar cut in Medicare a truly a

37
00:02:53,370 --> 00:02:58,430
dollar cut in Medicaid this is the Robin
Hood principle in Reverse

38
00:02:58,430 --> 00:03:03,570
Trump is taking for the middle class and
working families in order to give huge

39
00:03:03,570 --> 00:03:07,800
tax breaks to the people on top it is
unacceptable and we're gonna fight it as

40
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:12,090
hard as we can the president and Mick
Mulvaney the budget directors say that

41
00:03:12,090 --> 00:03:16,830
the middle class will get a huge tax cut
that that's where the focus is going to

42
00:03:16,830 --> 00:03:21,300
be you would oppose that bill if there
are also benefits to the wealthy as well

43
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:25,830
what's the cutoff point beyond which
well there's no huge yeah go ahead it is

44
00:03:25,830 --> 00:03:29,790
possible that some people you know
depending on the standard deduction it

45
00:03:29,790 --> 00:03:33,390
depending on the Earned Income Tax
Credit and how many children you have in

46
00:03:33,390 --> 00:03:37,080
your family it is possible that some
middle-class families may make some

47
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:43,920
gains but when you have a non-partisan
group telling us that at the end of ten

48
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:48,510
years eighty percent of the benefits go
to the tax the top one percent when

49
00:03:48,510 --> 00:03:53,010
there are a massive cuts in health care
and in education and programs

50
00:03:53,010 --> 00:03:57,510
desperately needed by the working people
of this country know the framework of

51
00:03:57,510 --> 00:04:02,940
this proposal is not something we can
support the truth is right now that the

52
00:04:02,940 --> 00:04:06,269
wealthiest people in this country are
doing phenomenally well and it is time

53
00:04:06,269 --> 00:04:11,459
we ask them to start paying their fair
share of taxes not give them tax breaks

54
00:04:11,459 --> 00:04:16,168
in order to cut Medicaid Medicare and
other important programs senator let's

55
00:04:16,168 --> 00:04:20,759
turn to the president's ongoing feud
with NFL players who take a knee during

56
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:24,630
the national anthem last night President
Trump tweeted quote very important an

57
00:04:24,630 --> 00:04:28,490
NFL players stand tomorrow and always
the playing of our National Anthem

58
00:04:28,490 --> 00:04:33,620
respect our flag and our country I want
to show you a new poll from CNN by a 49%

59
00:04:33,620 --> 00:04:37,940
to 43 percent margin voters do think
that NFL players are doing the wrong

60
00:04:37,940 --> 00:04:41,960
thing when they kneel during the
national anthem you've urged a

61
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:45,980
Democratic Party to go beyond identity
politics on this NFL issue do you worry

62
00:04:45,980 --> 00:04:49,639
the Democratic leaders might be falling
into some sort of a trap set by the

63
00:04:49,639 --> 00:04:54,800
president no Jake let's not worry about
the politics of what's going on let's

64
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:59,090
talk about why players are doing what
they're doing and that is that we have a

65
00:04:59,090 --> 00:05:04,639
real crisis in criminal justice in this
country the United States of America has

66
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:11,630
more people in jail than any other major
country on earth we have communities now

67
00:05:11,630 --> 00:05:17,840
where kids are being picked up for
smoking marijuana getting police records

68
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:22,190
which makes it difficult for them to get
the jobs that they need so I think what

69
00:05:22,190 --> 00:05:25,700
the players are talking about is the
need for criminal justice reform the

70
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:30,800
need for police department reform they
have the right to make that point and I

71
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:34,220
appreciate their standing up for what
they believe assertive health care

72
00:05:34,220 --> 00:05:37,940
president Trump said he will probably
sign an executive order next week

73
00:05:37,940 --> 00:05:41,090
allowing people to purchase health
insurance across state lines the

74
00:05:41,090 --> 00:05:45,729
president says he believes that would
lower costs would you support this move

75
00:05:45,729 --> 00:05:51,470
no I don't think I would but right now
what the president has got to do is to

76
00:05:51,470 --> 00:05:56,900
stop sabotaging the Affordable Care Act
he has cut back on funding for

77
00:05:56,900 --> 00:06:02,690
navigators to help people get into the
exchanges he has cut back on advertising

78
00:06:02,690 --> 00:06:08,300
explaining to people what their health
care options are look Jake I was really

79
00:06:08,300 --> 00:06:13,520
proud that we were able to do what the
American people wanted in defeating the

80
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:18,620
disastrous Republican proposal which
would have thrown 30 million Americans

81
00:06:18,620 --> 00:06:23,510
off of the health insurance they
currently have 30 million Americans what

82
00:06:23,510 --> 00:06:27,919
we should be doing now and what I would
hope Trump would be doing is during the

83
00:06:27,919 --> 00:06:31,910
campaign he talked about the high cost
of prescription drugs and he was right

84
00:06:31,910 --> 00:06:36,020
pharmaceutical industry is ripping off
the American people but since he has

85
00:06:36,020 --> 00:06:40,560
been elected I haven't heard one word
let us lower the cost

86
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:45,540
description drugs in America let us also
go forward short-term in making sure

87
00:06:45,540 --> 00:06:49,350
that people have a public option in
every state in this in the country if

88
00:06:49,350 --> 00:06:53,400
they're not happy with what private
insurance companies are providing them a

89
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:57,930
public option in many cases could be
less expensive with comprehensive health

90
00:06:57,930 --> 00:07:02,700
care long term in my view we have got to
join the rest of the industrialized

91
00:07:02,700 --> 00:07:07,800
world guarantee health care to all
people as a right not a privilege and

92
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:13,740
end the absurdity of paying twice as
much per capita as any other major

93
00:07:13,740 --> 00:07:16,710
country on earth
while the insurance companies and the

94
00:07:16,710 --> 00:07:21,240
drug companies make huge profits that's
where we have to go long term Democratic

95
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:24,210
Senator Bob Menendez is facing
corruption charges in New Jersey I want

96
00:07:24,210 --> 00:07:28,860
to show you a new poll from Suffolk
University USA Today it finds that 84%

97
00:07:28,860 --> 00:07:32,550
of the people in New Jersey would want
Menendez to resign if he's convicted

98
00:07:32,550 --> 00:07:36,000
where do you come down on this if
senator Menendez is convicted should he

99
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,540
resign immediately
buh-buh-buh-buh-buh you know I think in

100
00:07:39,540 --> 00:07:42,600
this country people are entitled to due
process

101
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:47,310
I'm not into speculating what if that
will be Menendez's decision he has not

102
00:07:47,310 --> 00:07:52,470
been convicted let the process take its
course you know in America that's what

103
00:07:52,470 --> 00:07:57,090
it's about you have a child and and
people the jury makes its decision they

104
00:07:57,090 --> 00:07:59,880
have not made their decision so I think
it's a little bit premature to be

105
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:02,669
talking about that senator Sanders
always good to see it thanks for coming

106
00:08:02,669 --> 00:00:00,000
on appreciate it
