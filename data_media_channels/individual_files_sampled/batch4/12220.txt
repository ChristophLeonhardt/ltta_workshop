the king of reality TV just gave us one of his best episodes yet we will break down the dock a meeting scene-by-scene line-by-line democrat humiliation by democrat humiliation then Allie Stuckey Bradley Devlin and Jacob Barry joined the panel of deplorable z' to discuss Trump's path to firing half of the EPA staff by the end of his first term absurd judicial overreach and warren buffett's warning on Bitcoin I'm Michael Knowles and this is the Michael Noel's show what an incredible meeting yesterday at the White House so for those of you who didn't see it Donald Trump invited up congressional leaders Senate leaders and House leaders from both parties cameras on he invited the press in the whole time sitting around the table to talk about daca and to talk about immigration this is a signature issue and this is a very contentious issue and it has been a contentious issue for almost a century now and Donald Trump invited everyone in to do this now that does make him the most transparent administration in recent history he has been very open with the press he'll go on and speak to them at length without scripts he's transparent in part because they're excuse me because there have been so many leaks also coming from the White House but contrary to what people predicted that he would be an autocrat that he would be a tyrannical he hasn't been easy open and of course he is we always should have predicted this he pioneered a reality television he pioneered a genre where people invite cameramen into their homes into their most private moments into their bedrooms and let them film him all the time of course he's going to be transparent he couldn't be anything but transparent because if that is his strength playing to his strengths inviting cameras into his private life is something he's been doing since the 1980s so of course he's going to bring it into his White House and into his presidency and unfortunately for some of the politicians in our room who are not used to that kind of scrutiny and that kind of clarity and transparency doesn't totally play well for them and it really makes him look good now this is not completely unprecedented Barack Obama held up one sort of similar meeting during his push for health cared for Obama care but he totally botched here's Obama know that geography does not dictate what kind of health care they would receive Thank You mr. president look let me just make this point John because we're not campaigning the election is over that that a total botch I mean absolutely awful that's probably why he didn't make it a regular feature of his presidency and why he presided over one of the least transparent administrations in American history he is there he can't help but be this crass and mean politician because all Barack Obama knows from his entire life is politics he all he ever did was write about himself and why he should be elected president before he actually was elected to Illinois State Senate and then the Senate for five seconds and then the presidency so he has to get those Barb's all he knows is that little political attack Donald Trump knows much more than that he knows how to entertain and he has been a businessman for his entire adult life so he it just allows him to interact with people and to interact with the cameras much better here is Trump here's how he opens well thank you very much everyone for being here I'm thrilled you do with a distinguished group of Republican and Democratic lawmakers from both the House and the Senate we have something in common we would like to see this get done and you know what this means we are here today to advance bipartisan immigration reform that serves the needs of the American families workers and taxpayers it's duhkha we've been talking about doctor for a long time I've been hearing about it for years long before I decided to go into this particular line of work and maybe we can do something we have a lot of good people in this room a lot of people that have a great spirit for taking care of people we represent we all represent so you have Barack Obama in a similar sort of meeting and he says well John the campaigns over when I am the president why I won this was for bribry right and Donald Trump opens up in a completely different turn the opposite tone he says we have a lot of good people here this problem has preceded me it's been around long before I was around as president and so you know we're going to take on this together I didn't ask to take this I didn't create the problem but now I'm in this line of work we're gonna do it so what are the priorities the border security agents the ice agents we have to give them the equipment they need we have to close loopholes and this really does include a very strong amount of different things for border security I think everybody in the room would agree to that I think that we it's a question of amounts but I think everyone agrees we have to have border security I don't think it'd be anybody that says no everybody agrees right we all we totally agree on that this is a verbal tic particularly of New Yorkers but it's really fun and transparent and effective my step-brother and I you know in New York we would do this to each other all the time say hey so I can have some of your whiskey yeah oh hey I can have your cigar what'd you do by saying look we all agree on this we're really just debating about this you're assuming the premise you're making people assume a premise that they might otherwise not take Donald Trump does this all the time by the way he blows past premises and gets you to negotiating on his own terms so the most famous example is the central campaign promise we're going to build the wall and Mexico will pay for it that's the great example before Donald Trump building a wall across the southern border of the United States was a very controversial position many people opposed it even within the Republican Party Donald Trump didn't say I'm gonna build a wall and that's my strong point he said of course we're gonna build the wall the question is just who's gonna pay for it and he's gonna make apparently ridiculous claim of who's going to pay for it so the whole conversation became about who would pay for the wall they just swallowed that they're going to build the wall whole cloth now what else will be in the final agreement want to see chain migration ended and we have a recent case along the West Side Highway having to do with chain migration where a man ran over killed eight people and many people injured badly loss of arms loss of legs horrible thing happened and then you look at the chain and all the people that came in because of him terrible situation and the or the other is to cancel the lottery program they call it Visa Lottery I just call it lottery but countries come in and they put names in a hopper they're not giving you their best name's common-sense means they're not giving you their best names they're giving you people that they don't want and then we take him out of the lab lottery and when they do it by hand where they put the hand in a bowl I probably what's in the hand or the worst of the worst notice the graphic vivid language he opens up so he's been so nice we have a lot of great people in the room and then he opens up and immediately ties the issue of the the border wall and the dreamer Dhaka people these people who were brought into the United States before they were fully grown adults he ties it to a terrorist attack in New York a radical Muslim terrorist attack that happened just last year and he's talking about body parts flying away we really grow stuff but things that create a very vivid picture in your mind he then moves on to the lottery and he says some people call it the Visa Lottery I call it the lottery and by the way there's no difference here right there's he's not actually making any categorical distinction or substantive difference between the two he just knows that the language of Visa Lottery you kind of your eyes glaze over what's a visa exactly I know it has to do with immigration and travel but for most Americans they just okay I guess but he says it's the lottery like when you go buy a lottery ticket and he's got this image of your hand reaching into the bowl and I yes one Juan Lopez Gonzalez he's gonna come in now and reaching into the bowl because that is absurd and the end the lottery system as it currently stands is absurd and he's drawing that comparison he's all of these images are floating around in your mind so that's how he frames a discussion then he turns the cameras on the people in the room we also as you know it was passed in 2006 a essentially similar thing they fence a very substantial fence was passed but unfortunately I don't know they never got it done but they need it that's the beginning of that line they all the politicians are all talk Donald Trump is a man of action all talk no action politicians and then Donald Trump but he points out he says you know you already voted for this you already voted for this a lot of Democrats already voted for that he starts calling them out because he says look this isn't me just being crazy and you're all dealing with me being crazy what he what you have done is what I am now executing you talked a lot about it now we're make it happen that's why we brought you here and as a matter of fact speaking of that isn't it a little curious who's sitting right next to him thanks mr. president for inviting us were honored to be part of this conversation September the fifth you challenges to challenge Congress you said we're going to end daca and now replace it as of today we've not done that dick durbin is sitting right next to him he's the assistant Democrat leader the second highest ranking Democrat in the Senate but it's not Chuck Schumer by the way it's not the leader it's the assistant it's a guide to Trump his reigning supreme here but to his right he's got the second highest ranking Democrat in the Senate and by the way on his other side is Steny Hoyer another Democrat the Democrat minority whip one of the highest ranking Democrats in Congress but it isn't it isn't Chuck and Nancy it's not Nancy Pelosi they lost their chance these are guys that we can make a deal with and listen to how respectful they are to him it isn't the resistance we're expecting yeah show him shove it right in his eyes you have a fork in his eye the resistance and then he says oh thank you for inviting us here though we didn't expect this maybe the government is being run differently than the mainstream media are telling us Democrats can't back away here they can't back away they're framed exactly on either side of him they are part of this and and what they get out of it is that they look like they have a seat at the table they get some credibility they're not just screaming little children that Donald Trump is showing them some respect and they're going to have to show him some respect in return if they don't want to get booted out of the room like Chuck and Nancy so let's turn to the other side and talk to Steny Hoyer in my view we can pass we can pass the protection in the what I understand your position is procedurally it was not done correctly you then as dick has said challenged us pass it correctly that's incredible you now have the Democrat House whip basically admitting the Barack Obama violated the law he's saying this wasn't done correctly that wasn't Barack Obama and didn't do this correctly now we have to do it correctly I wonder if this was scripted if these points these talking points were agreed upon by these three men ahead of clearly some terms work read upon for these opening remarks that in itself is a significant deal saying we'll give you this we'll give you this public showing if you give us this public showing it's not like they went in there an ad lib that they had all of this scripted out the question is what did they each know about where it was going to go you'll see at some points in the conversation the conversation gets sidetracked this meeting goes off the rails a little bit they pull it back in but a lot of it is pre scripted so Trump in his typically subtle way didn't want anybody to miss the point that the Democrat to his left just made I agree with him on that issue and interestingly when you say that President Obama when he signed the executive order actually said he doesn't have the right to do this and so you do have to go through Congress and you do have to make it permanent just in case you missed that we wouldn't want you to miss that we want anybody to miss what he just said but now notice how reasonable Donald Trump sounds as he's making that point is he saying Barack Obama is a dirty criminal liar and it was how reasonable that Michael Wolf booked that tabloid trash has alleged that Donald Trump is a screaming baby he's all emotion he's all reactive totally impulsive he can barely form a sentence we're not seeing that here not only is he calm he's conducting this discussion like an adult like he's the adult in the room he's even being conciliatory we also know by the way little sidebar we know that the claim about Trump being impulsive reckless emotional we know that isn't true because of Steve Bannon because of how Donald Trump treated Steve Bannon Bannon was making a lot of shaky comments negative comments leaking things to Donald Trump since the moment he was fired even before he was fired but Donald from held his fire he said okay we're not gonna play around just yet it was only after abandoned lost Alabama incredibly a Herculean task and achievement for a Republican to lose Alabama so he's at his lowest point professionally and he calls Trump and his family traitors then he drops the hammer but he a lot all of this president ban and Trump doesn't know anything he's just a vessel for my movement he let that slide he played very nicely while Bannon was still relatively loyal and then he pounced but that was planned out that wasn't just emotional one night he got angry and tweeted at Bannon so that you can have one or the other but you can't have both criticism simultaneous leave Donald Trump okay mister conciliator let's get some people on the record okay sure would agree to that also but we'll do it in steps and most people agree with that I think they'll do the steps even you said let's do this and then we go Phase two Kevin what would you like to say he's like a parent mediating between children we've been told that he's the child dealing with him is like dealing with the child but that's not we're saying I say look this is and and as you said as you have already said we need to do this and we're gonna have to negotiate and do this but he's the he's the one there right in the middle he's even mediating between people within their own parties so now that the stage is set let's start talking about the legislative solution itself well I think a good starting point would be Bob Goodlatte is done a bill and I understand you're ready to submit it and you're gonna take that and you'll submit and they'll negotiate in Congress in the house and then it goes through the Senate they'll negotiate both Republican and Democrat but it could be a good way of starting now if anyone has an idea different from that but I think starting in the house starting at the house might be good you're ready I think you're ready to go you know I would like to add the words merit into any bill that's submitted because I think we should have merit-based immigration like they have in Canada like you have in Australia so we have people coming in that have a great track record as opposed to as opposed to what we're doing now to be honest with you oh I don't know that seems like a good solution hey guys just off the top of my head I'm just spitballing here how about we start with the Republican plan for immigration a doc but we do that obviously we're gonna start with good lads bill but and and what Trump does is he immediately appears to break with it so he's sort of playing that I don't know just came to my top of my head but you know by the way before we do we're gonna have to add merit that all of these conversations have already happened this is totally performed for the cameras it's the performance of reality for the cameras gee who would be good at performing reality on television I don't Kim then his name escapes me of course so nobody's gonna disagree with that but did you catch his other line he says does anybody else have a bill to start with does anybody else does anybody else have another idea the cameras Ron here's your chance you're always complaining you're always saying that we're not listening to you and you're being shut out what's your plan do you have any plans and the Democrats are dead silent throughout the meeting Trump does is hey Johnny Sally do you want to add something do you want to speak you know because when you go on CNN later you're gonna say that we shut you up so here's your chance speak up if you have anything absolutely not it's easy to shriek resist and resist on CNN but now it's much harder now it is much more difficult when the cameras are on you and you actually have to legislate so now we get to precisely what Donald Trump wants the public to take away from this meeting he gets things done he is not an all talk no action politician he does things take it away you know one of the reasons I'm here Chuck so importantly is exactly that I mean normally you wouldn't have a president coming to this meeting normally frankly you'd have Democrats Republicans and maybe nothing would get done you know our system lends itself to not getting things done and I hear so much about earmarks the old earmark system how there was a great friendliness when you had here marks but of course they had other problems with the earmarks but maybe all of you should start thinking about going back to a form of earmarks because this system this system you should do it and I'm there with you because this sense of the system really lends itself to not getting along it lends itself to hostility and anger and they hate the Republicans of a hate the Democrats and you know in the old days of earmarks you can say what you want about certain presidents and others where they all talk about they went out to dinner at night and they all got along and they passed bills that was an earmark system and maybe we should think about it and we have to put better controls because it got a little bit out of hand but maybe that brings people together I love it I think Donald Trump is the first president in history to publicly campaign on earmarks that we need more earmarks the reason this sounds a little strange an earmark is pork barrel spending is what they call it right and it says well if you come over on this piece of legislation for me and I'll give you I'll vote for the post office in your district and then we can both benefit and get reelected right John McCain turned the Republican and conservative opinion against this when he ran for president he turned a lot of Republicans against earmarks because for one precise reason because John McCain is a big government spend a lot of money Republican he's a liberal Republican so he knew that if he was gonna run against spending he couldn't run against the actual drivers of the debt and deficit which are Medicare Medicaid Social Security big entitlement programs big federal programs he couldn't run against military spending John McCain is one of the biggest Hawks in the United States Senate so he had to run against the alt the only other little spending which is pork barrel spending the irony is though that pork barrel spending those earmarks really didn't constitute even a blip on the federal budget that was a little slush here and there to make votes easier but all of the drivers are those federal programs that John McCain supports so it was a big distraction at distracted Republicans for a couple election cycles but we shouldn't be distracted by that the earmarks are nothing compared to the big challenges which are federal regulation massive federal program spending and then entitled entitlement spending which actually drives our deficits so Trump here then Trump negotiates negotiation itself this is pretty masterful there are some things that you're proposing they're going to be very controversial and will be an impediment to agreement but you're gonna negotiate those things you're gonna sit down either say listen we can't agree here we will give you a half of that we're gonna negotiate the president's comprehensive means comprehend so we're not talking about doctrine oh now we're talking about we are we are talking about conferencing good why go there it's okay cuz you're not that far president many of the things that are mentioned ought to be a part of the negotiations regarding comprehensive immigration with it if you want to take it this step further you may I'm gonna have to rely on you which is you very complicated and you may delay daca somewhat so if you just miss that heap it's the Democrat congressional leaders against one another with the entire American public watching in the entire press corps filming the whole thing so he says oh you want comprehensive immigration reform is that where this conversation is going sure we all want that but that may delay daca you know that thing that we're all here talking about that you insisted we talk about well we made delay daca and there's that threat and it's not a fire and fury threat it's it's legitimately a subtle threat so you you have then on the other side dick Durbin so the Democrat dick Durbin says no no we're not talking about comprehensive we're talking about daca shut up Steny we stay focused and it's great because it makes them look like they're squabbling they don't have their act together they don't have their agenda together Trump split some and so he's putting a wedge between them great job this is one of the biggest wins for the Republicans in the meeting it gave Democrats the opportunity to humiliate themselves here is Democrat Henry Cuellar if you look at the latest DEA view worried about drugs look at the latest DEA report more drugs come through the ports of entry than in between ports but we're not even talking about ports of entry number one and some of us have been working this longer than some other folks number one if you look at the 11 to 12 million undocumented aliens which is a second face 40% of them came through visa overstay so you can put the most beautiful wall out there it's not going to stop them there because Oh either come by plane boat or or vehicle itself the other thing is the other thing that we got to look at the wall itself mr. president you talked to your mortar Patrol chief or the former Border Patrol chiefs I've asked them how much time does a wall by you they'll say a couple minutes or a few seconds it is our own Border Patrol chiefs that have said that but Smackdown Smackdown smack daddy brings up a point nope not true brings him another point no sorry also not true and he has to say cuz he's a politician so he can't say oh well I didn't know that he says oh yeah I know no you didn't know you just contradicted the point you just said something that is demonstrably false and then you were contradicted that's not even all of the stupid platitudes and talking points that this guy dropped well are said he said we're playing defense on the one-yard line with border security look how Mexico stopped immigration on their southern border Trump points out they didn't stop immigration on their border we stopped immigration on their border because overall illegal immigration has dropped since Donald Trump was elected president so obviously the people who were that no one's immigrating to Mexico because Mexico is a nice place Mexico is a terrible country and it's not enjoyable to live in people are going through Mexico to get to the United States which is Mecca right it's just hedges this heaven Lake the lovely place that everybody in the hemisphere wants to go to so Trump points that out he he and this is a rare interjection for him he's been letting them just smack each other around the whole meeting george w bush a great man but not great at this he never answered their stupid talking points you know he Donald Trump invites them all to come in in front of the cameras and then he smacks them down himself and he allows them to hit each other a few major takeaways here one Trump has a grasp of issues contrary to popular media reporting he has a grasp of the issues at one point when Kevin Brady and Dianne Feinstein started fighting Kevin McCarthy rather sums up what they want and Trump adds another ending the lottery system it makes Democrats put up or shut up it involves them in the government so so much for the resistance right they're flanking him left and right he appears at least as impressive and actually more impressive than all of those people I say more impressive only because they seem stiff a lot of the people in that room like like quail or Henry Cuellar is a good example or Steny Hoyer dick Durbin they're they're they're off batter fighting they go a little off balance and we can see that the mainstream media cannot convincingly lie about what we see with our own eyes most important takeaway as the mainstream media breathlessly reports the admitted lies in that tabloid book the meeting makes Trump look less scary to the American people Barak Obama did this it was one of his great achievements in the 1990s with his first memoir he you know he released this memoir Dreams from My Father during that explosion of memoirs by not famous people there was a opinion fever-pitch the the diving bell and the butterfly the kiss all these memoirs in the 1990s of just regular people and Barack Obama released and he said yeah I did coke and I ate dogs and Indonesian and I did this a man isn't that my father was a bigamist and everything but a real master stroke by the end of that book you're not afraid of Barack Obama he isn't scary so he did that memoir form in the 1990s during that explosion Donald Trump doesn't with reality television he brings in his strength his preferred medium reality TV and it makes him less scary by the end of that meeting okay let's

podcast so I'm not up to the level that you are of a daily podcast it'll be a weekly podcast you know not everyone can do it but it's God's really some of us are called to do to spread the cough FA that is good this actually might get me to subscribe to see our TV I you know I I don't use I use Crowder's mug as an ashtray when I smoke cigars so what I'm gonna do for that obviously but but now that you're there I'm much more compelled to do and Robbie that's right roaming Millennials getting a show - all right well both of you together I guess that's that's a pretty good argument to do it despite not gay Jarrod and crowd are being over there - okay well listen I know that you all on Facebook and YouTube want to hear from the panel we have to talk about this stupid judge in the middle of San Francisco ruling against daca and preventing Donald Trump from executing his office because we've elected him to do that there are a lot of other things we're gonna talk about a Bitcoin in a little bit we're also gonna talk about Donald Trump just burning the government to the ground and firing all these useless bureaucrats up but you don't get that unless you subscribe to daily wire.com if you subscribe what do you get well you get me you get the intercalated show you get the Ben Shapiro show all of that is well and good but forget about it what you really need is this because that meeting that that daca meeting that we all just walk through and analyzed we're gonna get that wall folks and when that wall goes up it's actually gonna make the floods of left us tears even worse because there's gonna be nowhere for the tears to go that can't go down and flood Mexico and Central and South America they're going to be stuck here and you are going to want to protect yourself and protect your family with the leftist yours tumbler so go to daily wire comm right now we'll be right back okay so this San Francisco District Judge William alsep a Clinton appointee has temporarily blocked President Trump from phasing out daca Bradley what is this about what is the judicial argument for blocking the end of a totally unconstitutional immigration power grab well first thanks for having me on Michael I have had a great time on winter break watching all this conservative policy go through it's it's been a great turn of events from Twitter trolling to actual policy it's fantastic you know we've been getting both great seeing Bannen implode anyway the legalities behind the injunction too and the daca rescinding from the Trump administration if you actually read I was reading some of the excerpts from his 49 page ruling this argument looks exactly like the argument a conservative judge would make when Obama was pushing through daca using prosecutorial discretion back in 2012 mm-hmm and so it says that Alsip said in the in the injunction plaintiffs have shown that they are likely to succeed on the merits of their claim that recension rescission was arbitrary and capricious hmm that's interesting the anomaly of the arbitrary and capricious when deciding that they weren't gonna uphold the rule of law and give and give amnesty to all these daca recipients who can now work have papers and receive welfare that was practically the Obama campaign slogan Obama 2012 arbitrary and capricious right just to say that the injunction was appropriate because our country has a strong interest in the uniform application of immigration law and policy oh my gosh are you kidding this is insane okay you cannot say that you want to have the uniform application of immigration law on policy because if that was the case you'd be on the ann coulter train and say deport all of them it doesn't matter right though is clear and the law is clear folks well this brings up a problem really because the law contradicts all of these regulations that came out of the executive so I do see a certain argument saying well we made this promise we made this executive regulation and even though that itself contradicts law you violating that would pose other legal problems Jacob is this a problem with the judiciary or with the regulatory state both it's a problem that the executive branch was basically Congress gave this power to President Obama even when the Republicans were in charged mama would say oh I'm gonna write out an executive order and the Republicans just went okay but then on the on the flip side when Trump actually says hey I'm going to give this power back to Congress a judge can say no you can't give that power back to Congress why it's what universe are we living in I don't think that the San Francisco federal judge even has the authority to do this so if I was president Trump course this is probably very unwise advice but I'd be like okay you made this ruling now you have to enforce it because it's completely an illegal it's a completely an illegal ruling he has no basis for this and it makes no sense as far as the Constitution goes and it'll be overturned it'll I'm not worried about it he's making some stupid point and that this is what gets to it Ally lest we become all talk and no action to quote a great man how do we combat this sort of absurd judicial overreach absolutely I think Senator Cornyn actually said it best he said it's absolutely ridiculous to think that Obama can create something that President Trump can't uncreate that's just not how it works and what I think is interesting about this as well is that this judge and I think previous judges but this judge I know is using Trump's recent tweets to try to psychoanalyze his motive behind rescinding this so Trump tweeted not too long ago that he basically wants the dreamers to stay that all of these well accomplished dreamers that have contributed so much to society are we really going to deport them which was kind of amazing when he tweeted that but he did and so this judge is basically saying look the president really wants them to stay the only thing that he is trying the only reason he's trying to rescind for the illegality and it is not what this judge is trying to say is that it is not the executive branch's role to say whether something is illegal or not it is the Supreme Court's role what do you think is completely hypocritical because of this guy if this judge was so concerned with legality illegality something being constitutional if he would have really similar concerns when Obama was passed in the first place outside exactly what Bradley was saying and I think that's funny and that's a trend that we see kind of across the board and I just realized that I'm not really answering your question I'm just talking a lot an interesting trend that we're seeing with all these judges that are pushing back on uh on Trump's attempt at immigration reform is that they all of the sudden care about constitutionality they all the sudden care about legality and following the rule of law they all the sudden have all of these concerns about keeping our democratic system and why when they never had those concerns when they agreed with the policies that that Obama was you know unilaterally pushing through completely unconstitutionally so I think that point alone just shows that this is a completely partisan move that like you said I think will be overture where absolutely and there and there are two lines of attack here as well so obviously one is nominating original ists to the court people who and texture lists to the court people who believe that words have meaning Constitution has a meaning and the words of laws have meanings that we cannot just interpret willy-nilly however we'd like that's one track the other is to reduce the size of the regulatory state so that we defer less to them on the execution of their own policies so that the courts defer less to them over democratically enacted laws and that takes me into the next news story the Washington Examiner yesterday reported that Donald Trump's EPA is on track to cut 47% of the EPA staff by the end of his first term that's just through retirement that's just through attrition losing people regularly we're talking about losing seven or eight thousand people at the EPA even Ronald Reagan the greatest American president of his century at least did not reduce the size of the government Ali will Trump reduce the size and scope of the federal government finally yeah so I'm Scott Pruitt was saying that the reason for this like you said it's through retirement and through just shrinking the agency in general the reason for this is because they want to go back to the basics when it comes to these regulations and protecting the environment I mean I think that there is a very careful balance of trying to protect the environment through common-sense regulations perhaps and not seeing it in the way of job creation and we know that that's a top priority of this president and the administration and this agency hasn't been as small as it's supposed to be I think it's around 14,000 since Ronald Reagan was president which is pretty incredible especially for all of the people that keep on saying that trumps a Democrat Trump's not a conservative I was one of those people but if you look at his track record especially with diminishing the scope of the government I mean he's one of one of the most if not the most conservative president that we've had in decades right absolutely right and I was surprised too I fell for that Donald Trump is a lifelong New Yorker he won't really cut the government we're seeing these lievable cuts and this does lead to a question Jacob why have passed Republican presidents not reduced the size of the government honestly think it's because of laziness outside of the Juke ol Ronald Reagan lazy how dare you well Ronald Reagan actually he had a Democrat Congress and so in that case it was the Congress being being competitive but I own it but I honestly think that's what it is I mean we saw when certainly when President George W Bush was in power he had a Republican Congress for a while and he didn't shrink the EPA and I really think that that's what it is you get distracted and of course you know with President Bush we had the war in Iraq and the war in Afghanistan and it which grew the government to some extent so I honestly think it's not some sort of malicious thing but I just think oh well shrinking the EPA well that really affect my numbers yeah probably not so I'm just gonna let it be and there is a question I mean we don't you don't exactly need Congress to fire people within your own branch of the government right there is a you know these guys are feds I once got to talk to Antonin Scalia and we asked about states rights he said states rights are dead they've been dead since the 17th amendment and the direct election of senators what are you going to look to me to protect states rights I'm a Fed I work for the federal government and there is an aspect of a president coming into office and saying you know it is sure helpful if I've got all of these big agencies there so that I can wield my own power for perfectly good policy let's say but it's it's much harder to say we're just going to cut people we're gonna fire we're gonna not replace people after they retire and at least for this first year these first twelve months we have seen historic cuts in the federal government and we can only hope that they continue let's move on and finally in our in our last minutes let's move on to something that that is unrelated I suppose to Donald Trump but it's I've resisted running this story I know a lot of conservatives and Republicans they've gotten very into crypto currencies they've gotten into Bitcoin people invested thirty five cents in Bitcoin ten years ago and they're now gazillion errors there now richer than Warren Buffett but Warren Buffett the Oracle of Omaha has is now saying that crypto currencies are headed for trouble that it won't end well the the Bitcoin surge is now much much larger than even the tulip a bubble in Holland I've been referring to them as a digital beanie babies Bradley you're a youth you're a young kid or people of your generation people at college campuses young conservatives are they investing in crypto currencies and or they are they afraid of losing all of their money they're obsessed I mean my friend just became a miner the other day my buddy is the chairman of the blockchain at Berkeley Club and we've been talking for a long time about about Bitcoin because I'm really struggling to understand it because when we're learning about money in classic economics classes there's two types of money there's fiat money which it's government its value is determined by government institutions that back it and then there's commodity money which means that that money or that money or exchange piece holds intrinsic value and can be used and therefore is worth something Bitcoin is none of those things in either commodity money the only thing that this thing applies to in classical economics isn't supply demand graph it derives its value from people being willing to supply it and people people demanding it um and so that that's see really seriously problematic when we're talking about money because Bitcoin rapidly appreciates when there's a good article about it when consumer demand goes up but then drastically drops from they can't maintain that hype and when you can't maintain that hype that money's not going through a money multiplier system we're not going to have cryptocurrency basic societies in the future it's foolish to think other of course it isn't a currency it doesn't meet any criteria of currencies and it also isn't even an asset it is just speculation and look I like going to casinos as much as the next guy so if you've made money gambling good on you but it isn't yeah one one kind of wacky conservative investment I made is I bought a bunch of rhodium which is a precious metal and I have a bar of rhodium and I made a hundred percent return last year so I've only been referring to that as coin coin this is a newfangled thing where you get a physical asset that you can invest in alley or crypto currencies are they just a fad and they're gonna go bust have to understand it I think the bradley did a very good job of explaining why this is so confusing to me I mean God just did not create my brain to understand cryptocurrency therefore I want nothing to do with it and if Warren Buffett says that it's a bad that I don't need to pay attention to that means that I'm a good company maybe I do understand it a lot more than other people do and that's why I don't want to spend any time thinking about it yeah yeah not only did he say that wants nothing to do with it he himself said I don't understand this thing when one Buffett says I don't understand we're gonna find out Donald Trump has just stores and stores hard drives and servers full of Bitcoin that stable genius all right panel that's all our time thank you for being here excellent to have all of you today that's our entire show make sure to tune into
