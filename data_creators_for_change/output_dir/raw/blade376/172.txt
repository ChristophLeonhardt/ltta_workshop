1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
censorship is brilliant and if you don't

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:04,740
believe<font color="#CCCCCC"> me you can just go fuck yourself</font>

3
00:00:04,740 --> 00:00:06,899
in a recent video<font color="#E5E5E5"> I did there was a lot</font>

4
00:00:06,899 --> 00:00:08,820
of discussion about censorship and I've

5
00:00:08,820 --> 00:00:11,250
concluded that it is a good<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing why</font>

6
00:00:11,250 --> 00:00:14,009
because it stops stupid like you from

7
00:00:14,009 --> 00:00:16,590
spewing your bile all over the place so

8
00:00:16,590 --> 00:00:17,880
for those of you that agree with me that

9
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:19,740
censorship is good there's no need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

10
00:00:19,740 --> 00:00:21,480
express your opinion because we all know

11
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:23,490
we are right and all of you that are

12
00:00:23,490 --> 00:00:26,519
against censorship you liberals who just

13
00:00:26,519 --> 00:00:28,650
think who it's about freedom of speech

14
00:00:28,650 --> 00:00:31,679
and that<font color="#E5E5E5"> freedom liberation just grow</font>

15
00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:35,040
the fuck up I've never heard one good

16
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:37,770
argument against censorship not<font color="#E5E5E5"> one</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> two</font>

17
00:00:37,770 --> 00:00:40,590
would be nice<font color="#E5E5E5"> but one just one people</font>

18
00:00:40,590 --> 00:00:41,910
can't come up with it because<font color="#E5E5E5"> the truth</font>

19
00:00:41,910 --> 00:00:44,120
is you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> all a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> bunch of fucking idiots</font>

20
00:00:44,120 --> 00:00:47,640
mindless sheep drones but someone has to

21
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:49,320
take control someone has to<font color="#E5E5E5"> take</font>

22
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:51,300
initiative there always<font color="#E5E5E5"> has to be a</font>

23
00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:53,280
leader because the<font color="#E5E5E5"> general public are</font>

24
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:55,739
idiots is the truth<font color="#E5E5E5"> and if you disagree</font>

25
00:00:55,739 --> 00:00:57,300
with me you're wrong because I mean why

26
00:00:57,300 --> 00:00:59,100
do want to waste precious minutes of my

27
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:02,820
life listening to some going on and on

28
00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:04,920
about whatever<font color="#E5E5E5"> he's going on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about I</font>

29
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:06,240

30
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:07,860
listening<font color="#CCCCCC"> to my don't have to I don't</font>

32
00:01:11,030 --> 00:01:14,070
protection censorship<font color="#E5E5E5"> is efficiency do</font>

33
00:01:14,070 --> 00:01:15,659

34
00:01:15,659 --> 00:01:17,880
no I<font color="#E5E5E5"> didn't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think so so all these</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> people</font>

35
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:20,009
going against censorship and they don't

36
00:01:20,009 --> 00:01:21,600
even<font color="#E5E5E5"> know where censorship comes from</font>

37
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:24,240
get your facts straight you want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font>

38
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:25,890
back in history there was something

39
00:01:25,890 --> 00:01:29,820
called<font color="#E5E5E5"> the HMS sensor ship and they had</font>

40
00:01:29,820 --> 00:01:31,920
to censor it because otherwise all the

41
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:34,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">people on the shore would have got</font>

42
00:01:34,350 --> 00:01:36,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">isil's from seeing the ludicrous book</font>

that was plastered on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the side of it it</font>

44
00:01:38,549 --> 00:01:40,229
was for the good of people so I'm gonna
