two police officers in Florida have been placed on administrative leave following an investigation into a viral video that showed the possibility of police brutality you will see it and you will judge for yourselves it is a brutal video but before we get to it let me give you the context the police arrested Daniel James Dunkel burger on Hallandale Beach Boulevard on Wednesday afternoon after he was seen taking a cell phone and a charger cable from a car so he'd burglarized the car to taser shots failed to subdue him and he braced his body to keep from being shackled and so the cops responded in the following brutal and graphic way just giving you that warning you didn't do anything right stop hitting him stop it either tonight to let him I don't care I understand that he robbed you but he doesn't hit him after the run everyone deserves but he doesn't deserve to be hit after he's on the ground he was on the ground you're hitting him you want to see the footage do you want to see the footage alright so the reason why we came across that video is because someone who had the person that you hear filming it posted it on social media on Twitter to be exact and he also included the following in the tweet police brutality in broad daylight on Hallandale Beach Drive police heavily beat this man up busted his head open led him to bleed heavily the man is known around the area to be a mentally challenged individual so knew the press tried to get in touch with him and they haven't been able to he's alleging that the man had mental health issues I have not confirmed that I haven't seen any confirmation of that but there is concern about excessive force there especially when he was already on the ground and they were still using batons to hit him he's been charged with resisting arrest without violence which makes me wonder why it took all that and they still had to physically grab him to take him down after the beating and so I might die is just wondering why I didn't start there two people one person he wasn't even moving when the video started I just wondered why all the hits in the officer had time the officer standing up had time to argue back and forth this guy I'm assuming if he needs that much of a beating is dangerous and violent scary how do you have time to argue with someone standing not even a part of this if you're focused on you know subduing a dangerous criminal so with these cop stories we often have to like argue with people even though we just saw the video you just saw and so but look there maybe it is that there is an honest disagreement about people's perspectives like so if somebody stole my cell phone and my charger for my car I'd be mad I'd be really mad right and I'd want him arrested okay if they if they said to me all right now we're gonna beat him like will you just show on the video and hit him over the head like that do you agree no I do not agree you know who else didn't agree the person who was burglarized you can also hear him in that video you know saying that he didn't want that to happen so you you hear the remorse in that man's voice and I think most people understand that while it's a crime and of course he shouldn't have done that and he should be arrested there's no reason why cops need to go the extra mile and start using that type of excessive force put them in handcuffs and that's that what why does it have to get to that point where they tase him and then they take out their batons and they started hitting him with the batons yes oh I get that it was was more difficult to arrest them and a lot of people have mental health issues and it is difficult to arrest them sometimes we've got to train our police better that when you run into someone who doesn't immediately follow your commands that the correct answer is not to beat him over the head until he's bleeding heavily and and that's unfortunately the go-to move but you know the reason I brought up honest disagreement is because I think that there are a lot of Americans that look at that go yeah if somebody took my stuff I'd want the cops to do that I guarantee you there'd be there's gonna be a ton of people who watch this video and go all you libs you you know you don't know anything you don't believe in America at least what America is supposed to be you believe in living in a police state you believe that authorities have all the right in the world to beat the hell out of someone to the wall by the way to shoot and kill someone who's unarmed if that person disrespects the officer or poses even a little bit of a challenge in arresting that person that's in my opinion not what we're supposed to support in the United States that is what you experience in an authoritarian country and if you want that then you should live in an authoritarian country you shouldn't be in a country like this yeah and the fact that the police don't work for us to have the accountability to the fact we we elect the we elect people within the police department I mean we are actively involved in the process and our taxpaying our tax dollars go to the police in the city of Los Angeles alone most of our taxes go to the police department so we should be heavily involved in how we want what what world we want to live in I don't want to live in a police state and I think the the other thing too is I'm just it I'm so boggled over how we treat people with mental health issues and the city of Los Angeles again just because I know about LA County so much is the the Howser of the most mentally ill people in the u.s. that's got to tell you something that our resort is to have our last resort or our first resort maybe is to have police use excessive force and to jail mentally ill people or people who have mental health issues and I'll say something else thank you for the cameraman who took that video bravely uploaded and online and I understand why he didn't want to reveal his identity because as we've learned in Ferguson and other places people who in Staten Island during Eric Garner's murder people who did videotape the police misbehaving they were held to account with hire either sentencing with more more of a heavy punishment whether it's was death in some cases then the police were and so last thing the police are off are on leave with pay one of them is on leave with pay the other one is retired and went back to the police force it's a weird story but it's just it's disgusting that's just the way it works yeah they usually get paid when they're on leave as they're being investigated and and that's the problem with the whole culture I mean look at what happened with Chelsea Manning Chelsea Manning shows among the different things that she released was the Apache helicopter video where our soldiers mowed down not only innocent journalists but then first responders who came to bring them to the hospital so even if they thought okay we're not going to punish them for killing the journalist because they thought the camera was a gun or something they were careless about it so no big deal it's a war we knew the people coming to help or bring them to the hospital and we killed them anyway but those people never got punished but Chelsea Manning got punished for revealing it and so that's why it's not surprising that a lot of times there are no consequences for the people in power but if you reveal what they are doing wrong there will be consequences for you but I agree with Mesa that there are acts of courage throughout the country now and and now we're finally getting to see what the ugly side of power looks like two easy ways follow Young Turks want us hit the subscribe button down below then you're a TYT subscriber and second is ring the bell and when you do that
