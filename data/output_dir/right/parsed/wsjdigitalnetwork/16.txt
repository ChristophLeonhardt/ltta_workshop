As an M&A reporter, you learn that scoops don’t heed social calendars,
so when I catch wind of one of the biggest scoops of the year,
naturally, I’m already halfway to my best friend’s wedding.
It’s a summer Friday,
and we’re driving to the rehearsal
when a source calls and says that Warren Buffett
is about to make the biggest deal of his career
by buying Precision Castparts for $37 billion dollars.
I have my friends pull over
so I can get out of the car and call my editor,
and we immediately start planning.
Obviously, the timing isn’t great,
and when we arrive at the venue where we’re supposed to be rehearsing,
I’m off working instead.
Meanwhile, my editor, Dana Cimilluca,
is hunting for other sources to confirm what I’d been told,
and soon I’m pressing my sources too
because we don’t want to get scooped.
By the time we’re at the rehearsal dinner,
my phone is dangerously low on battery.
The only power outlet is in the women’s bathroom,
so I lock myself in there and continue making calls all night,
though without much luck.
The next morning, I get up early to keep at it.
Eventually, the ceremony is getting really close,
and I’m with the bridal party getting ready
when I finally get a call back from a source.
He confirms the deal, and adds, “Your Bunny has a good nose,”
which is an inside joke on Wall Street.
So I call my editor to get everything ready to go,
and he actually has to park his kids at a fast food play area
just so he can publish as soon as possible.
We break the story on Saturday afternoon
and it runs on page one of Monday’s paper.
And by that afternoon,
I’m already working on the next scoop,
because that’s what it takes to break eight of the 10 biggest deals of the year.
Oh, and by the way,
it was a really beautiful wedding.
