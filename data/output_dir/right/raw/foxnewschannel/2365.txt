00:00:09,192 --> 00:00:11,461
>> Laura: IF A SOCIETY IS BEST

2
00:00:11,461 --> 00:00:14,331
JUDGED BY THE QUALITY OF ITS

3
00:00:14,331 --> 00:00:21,304
MERCY, BRITAIN'S SOCIALIZED

4
00:00:21,304 --> 00:00:24,007
MEDICAL SYSTEM IS FAILING.

5
00:00:24,007 --> 00:00:27,511
EIFFEL EVANS IS DYING FROM A

6
00:00:27,511 --> 00:00:29,179
CONDITION THAT DOCTORS HAVE BEEN

7
00:00:29,179 --> 00:00:31,114
UNABLE TO DIAGNOSIS.

8
00:00:31,114 --> 00:00:34,751
HE WAS TAKEN OFF A COURT ORDERED

9
00:00:34,751 --> 00:00:35,585
LIFE SUPPORT.

10
00:00:35,585 --> 00:00:37,654
HIS FAMILY WANTS TO TAKE HIM TO

11
00:00:37,654 --> 00:00:39,556
ITALY THAT IS OFFERING HIM AN

12
00:00:39,556 --> 00:00:41,425
ALTERNATIVE TREATMENT AND

13
00:00:41,425 --> 00:00:41,825
CITIZENSHIP.

14
00:00:41,825 --> 00:00:44,694
HERE TO DISCUSS WHAT THIS TELLS

15
00:00:44,694 --> 00:00:49,332
US ABOUT SOCIALIZED MEDICINE,

16
00:00:49,332 --> 00:00:49,633
NIGEL.

17
00:00:49,633 --> 00:00:51,334
THANKS FOR BEING HERE, NIGEL.

18
00:00:51,334 --> 00:00:53,336
I'VE BEEN PRAYING FOR ALFIE AND

19
00:00:53,336 --> 00:00:55,972
HIS FAMILY, BUT I HAVE A

20
00:00:55,972 --> 00:00:57,541
QUESTION FOR YOU TONIGHT.

21
00:00:57,541 --> 00:01:00,777
HOW CAN COURTS IN THE E.U. AND

22
00:01:00,777 --> 00:01:05,415
THE U.K. PREVENT A FAMILY FROM

23
00:01:05,415 --> 00:01:07,417
REMOVING THEIR CHILD FROM A

24
00:01:07,417 --> 00:01:10,053
HOSPITAL AND TAKING HIM OR HER

25
00:01:10,053 --> 00:01:11,655
TO ANOTHER COUNTRY FOR

26
00:01:11,655 --> 00:01:12,022
TREATMENT?

27
00:01:12,022 --> 00:01:12,823
HOW IS THAT EVEN HAPPEN

28
00:01:12,823 --> 00:01:13,223
SOMETHING.

29
00:01:13,223 --> 00:01:14,458
>> WHAT IS HAPPENING HERE IS THE

30
00:01:14,458 --> 00:01:16,526
RIGHTS OF THE PARENTS TO DO WHAT

31
00:01:16,526 --> 00:01:18,995
THEY THINK ARE RIGHT ARE BEING

32
00:01:18,995 --> 00:01:20,030
TAKEN AWAY FROM THEM.

33
00:01:20,030 --> 00:01:22,199
WE HAVE A CASE HERE -- IT'S NOT

34
00:01:22,199 --> 00:01:22,732
THE FIRST.

35
00:01:22,732 --> 00:01:25,435
WE HAD A BIG ONE LAST YEAR

36
00:01:25,435 --> 00:01:26,570
REGARDING A LITTLE BOY THAT

37
00:01:26,570 --> 00:01:28,104
WANTED TO GO TO AMERICA FOR

38
00:01:28,104 --> 00:01:28,839
TREATMENT, TREATMENT THAT WAS

39
00:01:28,839 --> 00:01:31,408
NOT AVAILABLE IN THE U.K.

40
00:01:31,408 --> 00:01:34,478
IN THIS CASE, FOR YOUNG ALFIE,

41
00:01:34,478 --> 00:01:35,912
THE TREATMENT WAS AVAILABLE IN

42
00:01:35,912 --> 00:01:36,780
ITALY BUT NOT HERE.

43
00:01:36,780 --> 00:01:38,582
THE LITTLE BOY IS SICK.

44
00:01:38,582 --> 00:01:41,818
BUT ANY PARENTS, ANY PARENT IN

45
00:01:41,818 --> 00:01:44,654
THE WORLD WHO HAS A CHILD THAT

46
00:01:44,654 --> 00:01:47,057
IS SICK WOULD MOVE HEAVEN AND

47
00:01:47,057 --> 00:01:48,658
EARTH IF SOMEBODY ELSE COULD

48
00:01:48,658 --> 00:01:50,494
OFFER THEM A DIFFERENT

49
00:01:50,494 --> 00:01:50,861
TREATMENT.

50
00:01:50,861 --> 00:01:54,297
YET WHAT HAPPENS HERE IS OUR

51
00:01:54,297 --> 00:01:57,567
STATE-RUN MEDICAL SYSTEM DECIDES

52
00:01:57,567 --> 00:01:59,302
THERE'S NOTHING ELSE THAT CAN BE

53
00:01:59,302 --> 00:02:01,171
DONE AND BACKED UP BY STATE

54
00:02:01,171 --> 00:02:02,839
COURTS, THEY MAKE A DECISION

55
00:02:02,839 --> 00:02:05,942
THAT THOSE PARENTS ARE NOT FIT

56
00:02:05,942 --> 00:02:08,612
TO MOVE THEIR CHILD SOMEWHERE

57
00:02:08,612 --> 00:02:08,912
ELSE.

58
00:02:08,912 --> 00:02:12,983
THE POPE HAS INTERVENED, THE

59
00:02:12,983 --> 00:00:00,000
PRESIDENT OF ITALY GRANTED HIM
