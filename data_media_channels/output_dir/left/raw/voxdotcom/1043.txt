00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,339
What you're looking at is an MPC 3000. It
sits in a room amongst the most iconic

2
00:00:05,339 --> 00:00:10,950
relics of our country's musical history,
and that room is on the fourth floor of

3
00:00:10,950 --> 00:00:16,949
the National Museum of African-American
History in our nation's capitol. that MPC

4
00:00:16,949 --> 00:00:21,480
was owned by J Dilla, who composed some
of the most revered beats in hip-hop

5
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:31,289
history. Technology has just taken a
giant leap forward. Hello I'm Roger Linn,

6
00:00:31,289 --> 00:00:36,420
and this is the MPC 60 MIDI production
Center created by myself and Akai

7
00:00:36,420 --> 00:00:41,730
professional. The MPC is this compact
machine that's a holding station for all

8
00:00:41,730 --> 00:00:47,489
types of samples which you can play with
16 touch sensitive pads. The very first

9
00:00:47,489 --> 00:00:52,410
model shipped in 1988 for just a few
thousand dollars and it was Akai and

10
00:00:52,410 --> 00:00:57,329
Roger Linn's elaboration on the Linn drum
machine. The concept though of taking

11
00:00:57,329 --> 00:01:01,020
samples of prerecorded sound and
composing with them existed long before

12
00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:06,240
the late 1980s, but those machines were
limited by their price and portability.

13
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:11,070
The MPC was a different beast because it
really put you in the driver's seat in

14
00:01:11,070 --> 00:01:16,320
terms of a sonic texture that you
wanted to have. That's Brian "Raydar" Ellis,

15
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:25,869
and that's his MPC Renaissance. You know
really just make a mess of it.

16
00:01:25,869 --> 00:01:31,700
It's a fully customizable machine where
as you look at maybe like the Linn drum

17
00:01:31,700 --> 00:01:35,780
or the Roland tr-808 which were
specifically drum machines, the sounds

18
00:01:35,780 --> 00:01:40,700
came pre-loaded and you couldn't change
them. In short, the MPC 60 was the

19
00:01:40,700 --> 00:01:47,930
musical brain of the studio. By 1994 when
Akai introduced the MPC 3000 it was the

20
00:01:47,930 --> 00:01:51,799
tool of choice for many of the top
hip-hop producers in the game including,

21
00:01:51,799 --> 00:01:54,440
J Dilla.
I think the thing with Dilla that

22
00:01:54,440 --> 00:02:00,320
inspired so many producers is that he
was able to use such a wide vocabulary

23
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:05,600
of technique. J Dilla was a producer out
of Detroit in the mid-90s through his

24
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:11,420
early death in 2006 from a rare blood
disease. He passed away just three days

25
00:02:11,420 --> 00:02:16,700
after releasing one of his most
fascinating and beloved albums, Donuts. He

26
00:02:16,700 --> 00:02:20,690
worked with an astounding list of iconic
artists and pulled off the majority of

27
00:02:20,690 --> 00:02:25,100
his sound with just a few simple
instruments, machines, and digital samplers, one of

28
00:02:25,100 --> 00:02:31,640
them being the MPC. He knew how to get
into every piece of the MPC and use it

29
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:37,100
to a musical advantage. So let's talk
about J Dilla's drum style first. He

30
00:02:37,100 --> 00:02:41,239
figured out how to humanize the drum
machine by avoiding certain things that

31
00:02:41,239 --> 00:02:45,530
he could have done to make it more
robotic, make it more stiff. For instance

32
00:02:45,530 --> 00:02:50,540
the MPC has this incredibly useful tool
called quantization. What quantizing does

33
00:02:50,540 --> 00:02:59,810
is it takes your performance, let's say
I'm playing my drum pattern, and when I'm

34
00:02:59,810 --> 00:03:03,980
playing it, sometimes it's a little ahead
it's a little bit time. If your kick

35
00:03:03,980 --> 00:03:08,060
drums are off by a little bit,
quantization snaps them in place. And so

36
00:03:08,060 --> 00:03:12,980
a lot of producers they use quantize, not
as a crutch, but just they just weren't

37
00:03:12,980 --> 00:03:16,609
thinking about not using it and so Dilla was like yeah I'm just gonna turn this

38
00:03:16,609 --> 00:03:26,769
off. The result is a discography full of
incredibly off-kilter drums.

39
00:03:29,439 --> 00:03:34,340
This loose strumming style was
incredibly influential. When Red Bull

40
00:03:34,340 --> 00:03:37,819
Music Academy interviewed Questlove he
said J Dilla's drumming technique

41
00:03:37,819 --> 00:03:45,440
single-handedly changed how he played.
Whereas this part is normal sounding. It sounded like

42
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:49,640
the kick drum was played by like a drunk
three-year-old. I was like "are you

43
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:58,970
allowed to do that?" So like that to
me was the most liberating moment. Dilla

44
00:03:58,970 --> 00:04:03,349
was known for his signature low-end
texture and his drums accounted for a

45
00:04:03,349 --> 00:04:10,730
lot of that sound. Here's just a regular
sampled kick, here's what that same kick

46
00:04:10,730 --> 00:04:16,639
with the high-end cutout sounds like.
You'll hear that kick in a lot of Dilla

47
00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:23,440
beats, like on The Pharcyde's "Runnin".

48
00:04:26,039 --> 00:04:32,409
The other half of Dilla's Low end came
from his bass lines. He had a way of kind

49
00:04:32,409 --> 00:04:35,189
of getting the fuzz in the pump out of a
bass line.

50
00:04:35,189 --> 00:04:40,719
The MPC gave Dilla the flexibility to
create and manipulate his bass in a lot

51
00:04:40,719 --> 00:04:43,960
of different ways. J Dilla didn't just
you know drop out of nowhere and just

52
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:47,469
know how to do everything all at once, he
was listening to a lot of the the

53
00:04:47,469 --> 00:04:52,659
legends. In fact, producers like Large
Professor, they used this technique a lot

54
00:04:52,659 --> 00:04:57,759
to get extra mileage out of the sample.
So right now I got this loop this is Gap

55
00:04:57,759 --> 00:05:02,400
Mangione "Diana in the Autumn Wind."

56
00:05:04,999 --> 00:05:09,409
In order to get a verse section what
producers would do is they would filter

57
00:05:09,409 --> 00:05:13,489
out the high-end and they just leave
this base space in here for the rapper

58
00:05:13,489 --> 00:05:17,689
to rap and then when the chorus came
back around they bring all the

59
00:05:17,689 --> 00:05:20,089
frequencies back, so you have a verse
section and of course section

60
00:05:20,089 --> 00:05:35,320
two-for-one sale.

61
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:39,770
One of my favorite Dilla baselines
though actually came from his moog

62
00:05:39,770 --> 00:05:44,630
synthesizer which was custom made by
Robert Moog himself. Just focus on how

63
00:05:44,630 --> 00:05:49,010
much his bass line rattles the low end
of the song and meanders in and around

64
00:05:49,010 --> 00:06:04,010
the beat. He's very meticulous about you
know what was going to kind of ooze and

65
00:06:04,010 --> 00:06:08,300
lay back a little bit. You listen to his Moog bass and it couldn't care less if it got

66
00:06:08,300 --> 00:06:12,380
there on time, but somehow it does. He
internalized every possible technique

67
00:06:12,380 --> 00:06:17,540
used in hip hop and expanded upon it, and
he did so with just an intense love and

68
00:06:17,540 --> 00:06:23,220
curiosity of sounds, and a lot of
patience. If we look back at E=MC2

69
00:06:23,220 --> 00:06:28,250
we've got an incredible sub
bass-y low end and example from an

70
00:06:28,250 --> 00:06:39,230
incredibly off-the-wall song by Giorgio
Moroder. Something that that makes this

71
00:06:39,230 --> 00:06:43,910
record stand out is the "equals" how he
extended it, because if you just listen

72
00:06:43,910 --> 00:06:47,990
it kind of only goes for a few beats,
and he was able to extend it as far as

73
00:06:47,990 --> 00:06:50,440
he wanted.

74
00:07:00,830 --> 00:07:05,189
There are so many songs that showed J
Dilla's ability to flip a sample, but

75
00:07:05,189 --> 00:07:13,870
there's one that gives me goosebumps
every time I hear it.

76
00:07:13,870 --> 00:07:16,510
A lot of people think sampling is easy
because they're like oh they're just

77
00:07:16,510 --> 00:07:19,900
listening to the melody on top and
they're not thinking about what the

78
00:07:19,900 --> 00:07:23,590
instruments below that lead melody are
doing and how they're playing a role in

79
00:07:23,590 --> 00:07:28,150
the beat. The first 40 seconds of "Don't
Cry" is just a few long loops of The

80
00:07:28,150 --> 00:07:33,160
Escorts "I can't stand (to see you cry)" -
he barely did anything with them. He's

81
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:39,470
basically saying "this is all I have to
work with"

82
00:07:39,629 --> 00:07:57,449
at 40 seconds though he says "now look
what I can do with this MPC."

83
00:07:57,830 --> 00:08:02,040
Instead of chopping to the melody, he
chopped up a handful of kicks and snares

84
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:07,500
throughout the entire song regardless of
the melody on top of it, and like little

85
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:11,130
puzzle pieces,
he resequenced those kicks and snares to

86
00:08:11,130 --> 00:08:19,510
create this entirely new dreamlike song.

87
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:29,880
I think Dilla was just like super funky
a lot of that had to do with you know

88
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:33,990
him being willing to not care if the
record speeds up or slows down as long

89
00:08:33,990 --> 00:08:37,380
as it feels good you know and just
throwing that care out the window and

90
00:08:37,380 --> 00:08:41,640
just being like "forget quantize man, it
does what I say it does" and just rocking like that.

91
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:45,990
Akai has
released a steady stream of MPC since

92
00:08:45,990 --> 00:08:50,850
the MPC 60 and 3000, they've gotten
glassier, more high-tech, more portable,

93
00:08:50,850 --> 00:08:56,670
and more integrated into digital audio
workstations than ever before. But those

94
00:08:56,670 --> 00:09:01,470
16 pads and scroll knob have persisted,
and that tactile design has even

95
00:09:01,470 --> 00:09:07,020
influenced the design of countless other
pieces of audio software. In the

96
00:09:07,020 --> 00:09:13,350
instruction manual for the MPC 3000,
Roger Linn gives an introduction, and in

97
00:09:13,350 --> 00:09:17,820
that introduction he asks the people
that use the MPC to treat it like an

98
00:09:17,820 --> 00:09:23,220
instrument - it's like the modern-day
piano or violin. And even though a lot of

99
00:09:23,220 --> 00:09:28,920
people say J Dilla never read the manual
for the MPC 3000, he still internalized

100
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:35,100
that same idea. He used his MPC like Jimi
Hendrix played his guitar, or John

101
00:09:35,100 --> 00:09:39,330
Coltrane played the saxophone - it was an
extension of himself.

102
00:09:39,330 --> 00:09:44,400
That's probably why out of all the MPC's
used by countless hip-hop producers and

103
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:49,879
beat makers
over the years, J Dilla's is in a museum.

104
00:09:49,879 --> 00:09:53,879
Hey thanks so much for watching the
video, I want to give a special thanks to

105
00:09:53,879 --> 00:09:59,249
Brian "Raydar" Ellis. In addition to being a
professor at Berkeley, he is also an emcee and

106
00:09:59,249 --> 00:10:02,970
producer and I've linked his work below
in the description. You will also find

107
00:10:02,970 --> 00:10:07,709
all of my sources and a lot of amazing
links to further reading about J Dilla

108
00:10:07,709 --> 00:10:11,519
if you want to learn more about him. I
didn't make a Spotify playlist and

109
00:10:11,519 --> 00:10:16,199
that's because one of the greatest ones
about J Dilla already exists. I've linked

110
00:10:16,199 --> 00:00:00,000
to that one in the description below
it's like 16 hours long it's amazing.
