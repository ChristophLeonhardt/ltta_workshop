about what it takes to be labeled alright these days so as someone who is quite familiar with the alright you may recall all the way back to the 2016 election cycle when the alt-right and I went out and on a routine basis mainly because they didn't like that I was a cook Jew and I didn't like that they were a bunch of anti-semitic mine freaks so I'm not fond of the alright I find the alt-right despicable and when I say all right I don't mean people who like memes I think memes are funny I don't mean people who voted for Donald Trump because the vast majority of those people are not alright I mean people who are actual racists who believe that there is a a white supremacy inherent in the color of your skin which is stupid and ridiculous and an anti-democratic well the problem is that the left has now broadened out the label alright to apply to anyone so they've labeled me alright which is incredibly insane I mean like fully full-on insane considering I was the number one target of the all right in 2016 according to the anti-defamation league I was the number one recipient of anti tweets among Jewish journalists with a bullet I mean I'm talking 40 percent of all anti-semitic tweets directed a journalists many of these from the all right or directed at me personally and yet now I am supposed to be believe that I I'm a member of the alright what made me a member of the alt-right well made me a member of the alt-right is that I am NOT on the left and the latest beneficiary of this particularly bizarre line of logic is of course our future president Tanya West so a few days ago I warned you that if you're conservative and you are supremely just in love with the fact that Kanye West is saying some mildly conservative things on Twitter you might want to hold off you might you might a great I'm glad he said that on Twitter but before you start declaring that he's a presidential candidate before you start saying he's a celebrity who knows things you might want to take a look at his older tweets which include things like four pillows are hard to sleep on true true I can't argue with that tweet but not exactly in line with I would say the intellectual thinking of the conservative movement but because Kanye tweeted these relatively mild things about how victim mentality is not good and how you ought to go out and work for yourself and how he likes Candace Owens who is the communications director of a turning point USA working with charlie quote charlie kirk and both good folks well now there's a person who's written for The Washington Post her name is Molly Roberts and she says that Kanye West is in all right darling which is weird since the alright is not particularly fine of black people but again this is the way that the left shrinks that Overton Window the Left says there is a window of acceptable rhetoric and if you're not on the Left you are outside that window of acceptable rhetoric sure Kanye spent most of the 2000 saying that george w bush was a vicious racist but now he's out of the tent because he says that self victimization is a disease and it's a I think a direct quote so here is what this this this leftist writes over at the Washington Post quote Kanye West was having a great weekend until he wasn't one moment the rapper producer entrepreneur was dispensing pearls of pseudo philosophy on Twitter to the retweets of adoring observers the next many of those same admirers had turned to denouncing him instead oh and he'd become an all right darling whatever West is going through at the moment the response to his Twitter spree reveals more about the people who have fled from him and those who have flocked to him to West's fortunes reversed writes this writes this writer for The Washington Post Molly Roberts when he expressed his admiration on Saturday for red pill youtuber Candace Owens an african-american Donald Trump supporter known for among other things referring to black lives matter protester as whiny toddlers pretending to be oppressed for attention the following day he tweeted nine videos from Scott Adams who gained his fame first for creating the cartoon Dilbert and second for proclaiming that rape is a natural instinct of men and society a virtual prison for men's desires okay that is taking Scott Adams wildly out of context I believe Scott Adams is actual argument is that natural instincts of human beings are bad and this is why you create civilizations which I thought was a relatively uncomplicated and and controversial notion in any case this is Molly Roberts continues it's easy to cast West is just another lost man seduced by the far rights provides a purpose all that pseudo philosophy does suggest a preoccupation well the sort of existential problems figures such as psychologist Jordan Peterson who has become a surprise lifestyle guru claim they can solve it's also possible to connect wess eccentric behavior on Twitter this isn't the first time his forays into politics have discomforted some fans the mental health struggles that led to his 2017 hospitalization so let's get this straight Kanye West who's reading crazy crap for most of his career I mean I read you some of his tweets the other day okay we're like talking about finding antique fish tanks right he needs an antique fish tank talking about how he is looking for a marble table a marble conference table because he can't actually have a meeting without a marble conference table hey Kanye is the guy who tweeted I love me some mayor I mean Kanye is is famous for not being unhinged might be a word that you might use in connection with Kanye this is a guy famous for charging on a stage in the middle of a music award ceremony to yell at Taylor Swift and now only now it does the left discover that Kanye might be a bit unstable why is he unstable because he tweeted that he likes Candace oh and videos all right well this is the way this is gonna go also I love that they linked Jordan Peterson a former professor at Harvard University and now professor over at University of Toronto widely widely understood to be one of the smarter humans alive to Kanye West that West is just another lost man seduced by the far rights promise to provide a sense of purpose it's so funny how the left talks about this they never talk about followers of Bernie Sanders this way Bernie Sanders promises to provide a sense of purpose also right his sense of purpose lies in the collective and his sense of purpose is I will tell you how you can help fix all of the problems of planet Earth by giving me lots of power and by redistributing on wealth the left never says look at all of these Bernie browser these are guys who are lost looking for something to do bored useless and now they found a sense of purpose in Bernie Sanders but when it comes to somebody on the right then all of a sudden it's lost angry young man experiencing existential angst welcome to the real world where a lot of people experience existential ONC's the question is who can cater to that in a healthy way Jordan caters to that in a healthy way but now they're saying that Kanye West is a jordan Peterson devotee or something I wish Kanye West where Jordan Peterson devotee I mean I think it would be really good for Kanye in fact Kanye go over and listen to Jordan Peterson's lectures on on the Bible on on the Enlightenment I think that that would be great for you but the Washington Post says that all of this makes Kanye West crazy so he wasn't crazy when he was crazy he's crazy when he's conservative and the Washington Post continues or could it be that Kanye West is coy stirred in a world of wealth away from the realities of racism that motivated incidents like his live declaration on television after Hurricane Katrina that George Bush doesn't care about black people he may be too preoccupied with his image of himself as a truth teller to recognize that the unconventional communication style he finds her attractive and Trump is just a way to cover up lies so I love this too so Kanye who was supremely wealthy during Hurricane Katrina I mean the guy was worth tens of millions of dollars by the time of Hurricane Katrina at that point he wasn't out of touch now he's out of touch and you can tell that he's out of touch because he's saying things that Molly Roberts doesn't like in the Washington Post that's how you can tell right I mean you know he's out of touch now you know he's a member of the alt-right because he said that self victimization is a problem because he said that you're in control of your own life Kanye says these things and boom this suit is like Hitler he is just like Hitler and now he's not even real black person is what Molly Roberts is really saying because a real black person would feel an authentic tied to his roots and Kanye doesn't feel an authentic tied to his roots anymore because he's become so wealthy and so cloistered weird I haven't heard the same thing about like Snoop Dogg right because snoop dogg makes videos about shooting the President of the United States it's noop dog is woke so snoop dogg obviously has a tie back to the people but Kanye has no tie back to those people obviously because he's wealthy right what happened is Kanye got rich and then he was on the left but he still had side to his people but then he was still rich and now he is saying things that aren't left-wing and this means that he has lost all tied to being black Kanye West is basically like Bill Nye the Science Guy in blackface that's basically what he is right now except Bill he's just a white guy yeah he's gone there people who are saying he's gone to the sunken place right which is a which is a reference to what I thought was a the racially polarizing movie get out which was overlooked by all the critics the bad racial messaging and get out was overlooked by all the critics because obviously it was a left-wing film The Washington Post continues in any case ascertaining why West thinks what he thinks is probably as fruitless as finding meaning in the bromines he's been offering up the past few days all you have to be is yourself the beauty is in the imperfections everything you do in life stems either from fear or love it might be more useful to examine what the reaction to US provocative tweets reveal about the left and right alike so health people reacted to west streets okay so here is what Molly Roberts writes in The Washington Post progressives West more typical fan basing greeted his return to Twitter with breathless engagement at the moment West expressed his approval of Owens liberals recoiled eager to signal their lefty credentials they withdrew their support the moment West went against that's the party line which sort of sounds like this writer then there's the right Alton otherwise most conservatives had less interest in West's work and they certainly didn't like it when he condemned Bush but now a lineup of luminaries on the right has assembled to defend West against liberal horns where Alex Jones once called West a microcosm of America's degeneration he now praises his bold moves against the thought police where Bill O'Reilly once described West as a disease the former Fox host on Sunday decried the attack against him by American stalinís okay so first of all I would just like to point out that Alex Jones is not really particularly representative of the view of the American right right you know like Alex Jones Alex Jones like that guy not supremely representative of the American right most people on the America member like okay glad Kanye is saying some nice stuff guys still Kanye he's weird what what do you have to say like nothing here okay but but you can feel all these same things like I did an entire segment two days ago about why conservatives should not be over the moon about Kanye West suddenly embracing the right-wing agenda right at the same time I'm defending him from American Stalinist like this column I mean this is this sort of thought policing Kanye West said something bad he must be crazy he must be a right-wing racist it's all insane it's all insane so this Molly Roberts concludes in the end the weekends West's affair was a very public display of people using other people West's hyped up his announced album even further with the publicity he gained from courting controversy liberals have shown off their willingness to enforce ideological purity no matter who the offender is and the far right has demonstrated once again they're willing to flip-flop at the slightest sign they might be able to land a mainstream celebrit don't trade your authenticity for approval west tweeted last week too late yeah again the left would not be complaining because they were talking for years about what awoke guy he was when he was ripping into george w bush so before we go any further honestly thanks to our sponsors over at blue apron

Kanye West I think that it is important to to give an update on the situation regarding Alfie Evans who's this two-year-old child in Great Britain so this two-year-old child in Great Britain almost two has been condemned to die by the British courts his parents want to remove him from Britain the Italian government has sent a plane the Italian government has said the day will provide for his medical care in Italy and the British government is saying no we will not let him out this is like Pharoah we will not let him go we will not let him go to save his life because he must die with dignity and we say that death with dignity means dying in our Hospital at our behest number one the idea of dying with dignity is such an salting term just the very terminology of dying with dignity is really bizarre because everybody is gonna die and the suggestion that if you cling to life that somehow you lack dignity or the suggestion that if you meet your end be it being sad about your impending death that this means that you are somehow lacking encourage that there is a dignified way to go in the dignified way to go is in a hospital surrounded by people who are pumping juice into you or alternatively the dignified way to go is for us to unhook a baby and watch that baby suffocate to death because the baby can't breathe properly doesn't seem super dignified to me you know everybody has to face death your choice as an adult is how to face it but as a child there's no such thing as dying with dignity there just isn't because you're not capable of dignity as a two-year-old okay I have a two-year-old boy he's not capable of dignity he's capable of pooping in his pants and being cute okay this is what my two-year-old is capable of he's awesome I love him dignity ain't on the menu but the idea that you're gonna take a two-year-old who's dying of a horrible brain disease and then say this child has to die with dignity it's such a stupid insulting term it's it's just a ridiculous term and beyond that the the arrogance of these folks to say that they know more than the parents about what is best for the child than what's best for the child is to die without this experimental treatment who the hell are they to decide that who are they to decide what sort of life is best worth living the medical profession used to be about the Hippocratic oath preserving life as long as humanly possible now the medical profession has become the great arbiter of the lives that are worthy this is true in Great Britain it's true in the United States as well yeah people like Ezekiel Emanuel saying he wants to die at 80 because he doesn't want to live with disease well that's his choice he can do what he wants free country but the idea that his standard for a dignified life should be the standard for everyone even above the wishes of parents we're the ones who have to spend time with their child who have to sit the father last night was giving mouth-to-mouth to his son because the hospital would not give his son oxygen okay this is evil what we're watching in Britain it's evil and that's happening because the buraco the the bureaucracy the centralized bureaucracy of great states have decided they know more than the common man about virtue and vice they know more about dignity and death than the common person including a common person who has to actually visit the gravestone of these doctors gonna be going to alfea's grave after the kid dies I promise you as parents well just horrifying okay so meanwhile speaking of a foolish we in the United States are consumed with with the most important issues here's an important issue from the New York Times from jo-ann's Patera Mizpah Tarot is a new york-based writer who's engaged to a transgender woman which is to say a man right a biological man and here is the piece from the New York Times because we you know the New York Times only traffics in the most important ideas are the things that we all have to come to grips with as a society no not like religious freedom or the value of life not stuff about what the government ought to be involved in your healthcare decisions no what they have to be involved in is explaining how it is that a woman and a man who's had some hormone treatments can have a baby and it's the same thing as two lesbians magically having a baby I just weird weird okay so here is what it says our society may have lost its moorings just just a little okay so here's what the New York Times piece from jo-ann's pateros says over the last several months I've spent evenings watching my fiance Lara inject herself with smaller and smaller doses of estrogen there again is a biological man I've watched her stand in front of a mirror singeing each hair out of her face with a second hand electrolysis machine the return of her testosterone hasn't resulted in just the resurgence of facial hair her pants now fit differently to my own skin has been plagued by acne since I got off the pill six months ago and my default states are angry hungry are sleeping such are the perils of trying to have a child the way Lara and I are trying without in vitro fertilization or cryogenically frozen sperm the way fertile cisgender people do they simply couple up and boom a child is born I'm not sure why there are perils involved with this I've done it twice it was great okay let's be real about this make babies pretty awesome people been doing it for hundreds of thousands of years not seeing the tough part here and not seeing the reason we have to have a let's look at this twelve hundred word essay on you having sex with a dude who thinks he's a lady not sure why that is worthy of space in the New York Times but all right all right I just I love that everything if you could run a scam right let's say it's so funny folks on the left are constantly thinking that you know the bible thumpers the people who believe in things like actual biology that these people what they're really seeking to do is they want to take lesbians and they want to marry them off to men and force them into a situation where they have to have biological children with a male I guess all we have to do now is declare that the man's a woman and then we're good right I mean this woman's a lesbian but she's having sex with a full-on man because the man is a woman but not really because he says he's a woman because he has some sort of mental disorder man this is again worthy of coverage in the New York Times for many young trans people the question of having babies is likely the last thing on their minds who could blame them like all young people they're figuring out their future in matters of diapers and breastfeeding seem abstract and far off but unlike all young people young trans people are often making choices that have long-term consequences for their fertility which is part of how I 32 year old cisgender lesbian and Lyra my 33 year old trans fiance came to be in the situation we're in today trying to conceive a child even though Larra transition nearly four years ago Elara transitioned sort of Larra still has the the non lira parts right lares still has the John parts or whatever leras previous name was her dead name as they say I didn't even vaguely realize how I wanted biological kills kids until my mid-20s before then I'd vaguely imagined that children would simply come to me our Auntie Mame or Diane Keaton and baby blue might inherit them from a long-lost relative and simply slot them into my independent modern life little did I know that in just a few years I'd be staying up to read studies in which scientists combined the eggs of two female rats to make a child hoping for 50 more years on the planet so I'd be around when they began testing on humans but you don't need them to combine two female eggs you're having sex with a dude who has sperm so that's odd again the reason that I highlight this is just to demonstrate that when you cast out biological distinctions and pretend that science is something that science is not you end up with bizarre notions like the idea that it's some sort of great earth-shaking event when a man and a woman have sex and promote and and create a baby because the man has been taking some hormone treatments also this article is making a case that I pretty sure decided this writer doesn't want to make right which is the which is that it may be worthwhile for transgender people not to actually mutilate their own genitals then it may be worthwhile for them to keep the genitals that they have so they can actually procreate when they choose to do so this is actually the the subtle case that is being made by this article but it's it's pretty amazing it's pretty amazing so at the very end she Joanne's Patera actually says that she says the truth is some people know from the beginning they never want kids but some even those who thought they were sure can one day find themselves feeling differently especially if they meet someone they'd love to blend genes with these people can then find that permanent decisions made early on may have closed doors before they even knew they wanted to open them so pretty pretty interesting stuff actually is that the the conclusion of the article is the conservative conclusion that you may want to wait to have hormone treatment and mutilate your body because you think that you're a member of the opposite sex because you might never know what sort of choices you want to make later so but this is what happens when a society decides to purposely confuse itself about basic concepts like what gender constitutes okay so before I go in before I go any for the first I want to say thank you to our sponsors over at Skillshare so Skillshare is an

of the media's promulgation of particular ideas about gender and transgenderism it is pretty obvious that this is having a significant impact on the on the society at large now I guess the the government is going to tell your children how to think about these issues so on Monday there's a feminist writer named Jessica Valenti and she made pretty clear why a lot of conservatives are looking to homeschool their kids okay she tweeted out this she tweeted out to the folks who find gbt language confusing if my daughter's second grade class gets it so can you okay and here is what the the the picture that she tweeted out says his lesbian a woman who has only romantic feelings about women gay a man who has only romantic feelings about men by a person who has romantic feelings about men and women why would a seven-year-old needs to know these things you asked because we have to indoctrinate them at 7 years old otherwise they will turn out to be intolerant Americans transgender a person who is assigned male or female at birth but doesn't identify that way okay that is so anti scientific I cannot even begin to explain it okay you're not assigned male or female at birth it's not like the doctor sits there and flips a coin and goes you know what you're a male I just figured it out you know we're gonna assign it to you right just like you're given an assignment in class no the doctor looks at the PP or the juju and then says you are a male or a female okay this is really not difficult seriously the doctor does not assign sex at birth by the way if you're gonna say the doctor of science sex assigns it they're gonna have to go back to the ultrasound because by 10 weeks you know whether your baby's a boy or a girl in fact we can tell even earlier than that in some cases simply by looking at the mother's blood stream because the baby's because certain cells from the baby are present in blood tests for the mother and you can tell whether the baby is a boy or a girl it's not a sign I mean this is this notion that that sex is some sort of social construct is so insane or the gender is completely untethered from sex it doesn't even make sense according to the according to the advocates of transgenderism if gender and sex are completely untethered then why is it the transgender people want to appear to look like women why is it the transgender people find it important to use female names if all this untethered from is untethered from sex and completely arbitrary then wouldn't you just assume you could be transgender without picking up any of those cultural stereotypes that have been created by that patriarchal white cisgender society and also these second graders are learning a person who has assigned male or female at birth and does identify that way is a cisgender person a queer person it's complex and can mean a lot of things a person who doesn't identify as straight or bi or gay or lesbian well thanks for that clarification and straight is a man who only has romantic feelings about women or a woman who only has romantic feelings about man again I'm so glad that second graders are learning this in Jessica Valenti's second grade child's class very important stuff the reason I bring this up is because the same government that says it gets to decide whether your should live or die in Britain it's the same government that gets to decide whether your school teaches you this propaganda or not okay so there's a Jewish school in Britain it's now it's been threatened for two years by the British authorities because it is a Jewish school meaning and they do not want to teach propaganda from the LGBT left they're not interested in teaching about the moral equivalence between heterosexual sex and homosexual sex they're not interested in teaching about the the socially approved ideas of transgenderism they say that God made men and God made women and there are some people who are born intersex but that's not the same thing as transgenderism that school is now being threatened with its licence revoked revocation license revocation in Britain okay so the same government that's telling you how to raise your child is telling you when your child has to die centralized government is such a nightmare this is why it sort of matters when you when you see these pieces that seem to be on the wild bluff because everything that starts off on the wild left ends up on the mainstream left within about five minutes right the whole goal here is indoctrination of children and you can see this even in so far as it there's another story that's insane apparently according to live site news transgender activists gathered outside a Rhode Island Catholic Church last week it's a Catholic Church for God's sake to protest a lecture delivered by pediatrician Michelle Katella who views affirming transgenderism and kids as a form of child abuse okay it's a Catholic Church what do you think she is going to say by the way I tend to agree with this position I tend to agree with the position that if my two-year-old came to me and said daddy I'm a girl and I said to him you know what you're right kid you're a girl ignore all your biology you're a girl that purposefully confusing children is a form of child abuse Eilidh case to be made for this Michelle certainly the idea of generally mutilating or or hormonal EMU t'lay ting children I think is a form of child to be as pretty obviously in any case Michelle critera is president of the American College of pediatricians and she's made it her mission to highlight the harmful effects of gender transitioning on children according to Paul Bois over at say Lee Weyer at the time of her comments Rhode Island had recently enacted a law stripping parents of their right to object to providing treatment for gender transition to children who showed signs of gender dysphoria okay the Roman Island Catholic explained the law quote last year the state of Rhode Island made it illegal for a licensed medical professional to counsel away from the desire to change his or her gender identity it remains legal to inject that same child with hormone blockers and cross-sex hormones currently Rhode Island public schools are deciding how to implement statewide transgender policies that would open up bathrooms locker rooms and sports teams to anyone who claims to be the opposite gender from their biological sex it's one thing to argue that if you are a parent you should be allowed to make the terrible decision about about forwarding your child's transgender transgender feelings as it's a terrible decision because studies show that well over 80% of all children who believe they are transgender when their children outgrow it by the time they're teenagers very often they end up Carol is bein hey but the state has now mandated has now mandated that everyone be indoctrinated with these ideas and it's a very short leap from here to the idea that homeschooling itself should be legal so a lot of Christians a lot of Jews have started taking their kids Muslims too and started taking their kids out of public schools and educating their children at home to avoid these social leftist strictures well the state is not going to stand for that the state is going to say that you are not licensed to do that and your kid is a truant and then they will say next that if your kid does not learn what the state wants our kids to learn then they will take your kid away from you and give them up to foster care that's none Child Protective Services I am predicting this right now okay you can mark the date I've been predicting this for months now you can mark the date today's April 25th within five years there will be a serious movement in this country to end homeschooling simply because everyone on the Left believes that homeschooling is a threat to their social values and the case will be made that you're bringing up kids to be intolerant you're bringing kids to be up you bring up kids to be cruel and nasty parental power will shrink as the power of the state grows anyway this woman critera dr. Kurt Ella she was speaking at the st. Pius v Church in Providence - and 40 LGBT activists showed up outside and and then they started protesting her it's it's just astonishing again they're protesting churches this is why when people on the Left say why do you feel so threatened by by all of this yeah you can do what you want it's a free country you'll go to whatever lefty Church you want to go to don't go to church at all I don't care all right be gay be lesbian be transgender you're an adult your decision okay as a religious person I can think your decisions are sinful doesn't matter it's a free country you can think I'm an idiot we'll tell you that once you start going outside churches and protesting traditional churches suggesting those traditional churches have to change their ways or face your wrath you're talking about something deeply disturbing and fistic in the extreme now in just a second I wanna discuss the controversy swirling around joy read over over at MSNBC because she is now in serious trouble but I'll explain that in just a second first I want to say thanks to our sponsors over at policy genius so 71% of Americans say they need life insurance but only 59% of them have actually gotten coverage

over to youtube subscribe leave us a review go over to iTunes do the same thing we always appreciate it we are the largest fastest growing conservative podcast in the nation all righty so a leading LGBT advocacy Brook group has now rescinded its straight for equality and Media Award from MSNBC MSNBC host joy Reed on Tuesday now it would be easier for me to follow this controversy if Troy Reid had not in fact blocked me on Twitter years ago but it turns out that joy read years ago around a blog and on that blog she posted stuff that was supposedly homophobic I went back and I read the comments and they're not great for a leftist but they're also not particularly over-the-top like she says things in is it to give you some context she says things like the sight of two men kissing makes her uncomfortable I'm not sure why that's homophobic like really I'm not sure why that's homophobic I would assume that for gay people watching straight people kiss is is not something they enjoy particularly much she says that she said that she isn't that she didn't want to watch Brokeback Mountain because it made her uncomfortable again I think the whole predicate of of our sexual freedom society is that whatever floats your boat which means by necessity certain things do not float your boat which means that you have to leave people alone if things don't float their boat apparently dry Reid committed some sort of grave sin here and now she must be cast out like a leper from the leftist group think so Liz Owens director of communications for PFLAG Nacional said the group had invited Reid to honor her at their 45th anniversary celebration DRI reads Ben Pro same-sex marriage for years knowing about some posts she'd already apologized for but there were new posts that had caused it to rescind the invitation Owen said we appreciated how she stepped up took ownership apologized for them and did better this is the behavior and approach we ask of any ally however in light of new information and the ongoing investigation of that information we must at this time rescind our award to miss Reid so these newly uncovered posts were uncovered by media ight and she responded that the that she had been hacked that this was all the result of hacking which is real weird this is her big mistake is that she suggested that she she she came out and she said that um that these were fake right she made the Anthony Weiner mistake you're not allowed to make the Anthony Weiner mistake it's one thing to post a bunch of weird stuff and then apologize for it later but joy Reid instead said that she she'd been hacked which led to this entire controversy about whether in fact she'd been hacked the answer is probably not right she does all this stuff had been discovered by looking at the internet archives wayback machine the Wayback Machine captures websites old websites and old posts and there is no indicator that the wayback machine itself had been hacked but the point here is simply that the left is so intolerant that no matter how much joy read may believe that she has an ally she is in fact not an ally right she cannot be an ally because she said something that people don't like 15 years ago 1215 years ago even though she has recanted all of those particular posts right so it's this is I think really bad a lot of people on the right are jumping on this and saying joy read should lose her career try read should be fired and listen I understand the the satanic temptation to stomp on joy reads grave I get it like I understand that there are a bunch of people on the left you say really nasty thing about the right and if this were someone on right I don't think joy Reid would be defending them but I'm gonna say for the record that I think that somebody who had positions that they then recanted and clearly recanted and are no longer associated with I don't mean you keith Ellison who continued to meet with the Nation of Islam I mean like joy Reid who has recanted all of her positions on this and switched I don't see why bringing up their old post and then destroying their career over it is a worthwhile thing because the truth is you can do this about pretty much anything anybody was in a long career in in public is going to have said some stuff that they're embarrassed of anybody in public is going to have said them things that they wish they hadn't said some of them change position I've changed some of my positions over the years there's a column I wrote in 2007 about what I term traitorous Democrats talking about the Iraq war that I probably wouldn't right now right that was 11 years ago there's a column I wrote very early in my career about the israeli-palestinian issue in which I suggested transfer as a possibility for for Arab populations I openly recounted that I think this is true for pretty much everybody in public life if you go back far enough you can find something they said that they no longer believe and destroying them over that is a really dangerous game because if we're gonna do that then people are just going to hide what they believe what you actually want from your public from your public personas what you actually want from opinion-makers are their thoughts you don't want them hiding their thoughts you don't want them hiding the ball you want to know what they think because that's how we can engage with these ideas that's how we as a side you can call out the bad ideas and garner the good ones that's the whole goal and again I just I find the whole attack on joy read to be wildly wildly silly particularly from the left so I'm looking at some of these I'm looking at some of these posts right now so she wrote a post called charlie crist is not gay she wrote a post apparently or this was on her website is called Harriet Miers and the lesbian hair track talking about Harriet Miers is lesbian hair like really that's the kind of stuff that you gonna ruin her career over and says don't you sue me Tom Cruise like making a joke about Tom Cruise being gay because he's long been rumored to be gay again I'm not sure why any of this is particularly homophobic and pretty Cowboys in love or last gasp but gay chic was the title of one of her pieces she says here's one of the posts that is supposed to be just awful awful dry read has to have a career ended because of this quote keeping it real most strip men feel exactly the same way when would have the exact same reactions he had he had stripping naked in a sweaty locker room in close quarters with a gay teammate most straight people cringe at the sight of two men kissing most straight people had a hard time being convinced to watch Brokeback Mountain I admit that I couldn't go see the movie either despite my sister's ringing endorsement because I didn't want to watch the two male characters having sex does that make me homophobic probably well the truth is it doesn't make you homophobic because again being a homophobe just means that you are scared of gay people or scared of homosexual activity or presumably that you're bigoted against homosexuals not being into the activity does not mean you're homophobic again if I were the case then gay people would be straight phobic because that logic doesn't hold at all here's another one of the posts that supposedly has to finish joy Reid's career some people use the word immoral when they really means it's tasteful I think a lot of heterosexuals especially men find the idea of homosexual homosexual sex to be well gross and they lump it in with immorality and then there are the concerns that adult gay men tend to be attracted to very young post-pubescent types bringing them into the lifestyle in a way that many people consider it to be immoral so that last sentence is the one that borders on the controversial right that last sentence where she says that there are adult gay men who prey on younger men you know that that's the only section here that I find to be you know truly truly controversial but again joy Reid has apologized for all this stuff in the past as a society we're gonna have to be a little bit more forgiving of people I mean right and left people who have recanted prior views because otherwise I think you just end up in a position where nobody will give their views openly at all about virtually anything okay so meanwhile the controversy has broken out without president Trump's nominee to fill the VA so he was not Ronni Jackson Ronnie Jackson of course was the White House physician and there are a lot of bad stories they've been breaking about Ronnie Jackson apparently Ronnie Jackson there's report that he was drunk on duty at one point and and the Democrats are immediately jumping on this here is one Democratic senator unloading on Ronnie Jackson yesterday they fallin in three different areas improper dispensing of prescription drugs repeatedly drunk while on duty while traveling and creating a toxic work environment by the way we had twenty military folks and retired military folks tell us these stories and in the previous administration we were told of stories there were he was repeatedly drunk while on duty where his main job was to take care of the most powerful man in the world that's not acceptable yeah so I mean there are a lot of people who are testifying this wasn't a great peg now I don't know that much about Ronnie Jackson the White House is sort of standing by him sort of not Trump yesterday did a real weird thing where you urged his own nominee to bow out during a press conference which is kind of wild here's what President Trump had to say about Ronnie Jackson the the White House position being considered for VA secretary I told Admiral Jackson just a little while ago I said what do you need this for this is a vicious group of people that maligned and they do and I lived through it we all live through it you people are getting record ratings because of it so congratulations but I said what do you need it for he's an admiral he's a great leader and they questioned him about every little thing it's kind of weird that Trump was urging his own nominee to bail out I will say that the vetting of the nominees has to be better from the White House you actually have to go back and look at the record picking people that Trump personally knows for positions doesn't seem to be working out all that well and the administration has been getting steadily better I mean the staffing at the administration has been getting better we've gotten rid of a bad VA secretary we have gotten rid of a bad Secretary of State we've gotten rid of a national security advisor in favor of a better national security adviser I think that things that the the staff on the whole today is much better than the staff was on the whole a year ago that said they kind of fly by the seat of your pants vetting of nominees has to stop from the Trump administration it continues to it continues to promulgate gay there's a lot of chaos inside the administration which unfortunately there there is that said the media bias on all of this stuff isn't saying hey Trump is not wrong when he says that the media are just wild about everything Chris Chile's over at the over at CNN spent an entire segment an entire segment of TV analyzing an awkward handshake photo of Donald Trump and Emmanuel macron the president of France like an entire segment here here here's what it actually looked like it's so it's so bizarre so obviously lots of people talking about Melania Trump's hat that's the buzz of the picture but I just want to point one thing out people will say oh I did I find this the political theatrics fascinating what is going on here and here why is macron doing the hook em horns it's very Simmons kiss guitarist thing but either way it's super weird okay you know what's super weird is that the media are fascinated with presidential handshakes yeah I made fun of them for like five seconds yesterday but the media spent full on segments yesterday analyzing the weird dynamics between Trump and McCrone is that says any sort of relevance to anyone basically the media have become TMZ so there's a movie that's out called I Tanya and there's a scene in the movie where there's a guy who was working for a National Enquirer like publication and he says that we were staking out Tonya Harding's house and we were covering this thing in insane fashion providing them the model for the mainstream media and he's not wrong it's a joke in the movie but it's not a joke okay this is covered the same way that you'd cover it on the soup hey this is covered the same exact way that you would cover it if you were watching TMZ and TMZ were covering this handshake and it's happening on CNN and then people wonder why there's significant credibility problems with the media and speaking of credibility problems of the media there was a piece that came out from the Washington Post yesterday that was a picture of three reporters they Ashley Parker April Ryan who's the the black reporter from the African American news network whose name I can't recall and and the third person was at Jim Acosta the insufferable Jim Acosta from CNN and they are all standing there and doing a hero shot looking off in resistance the entire article is about heroic these members the media are in the face of the Trump administration okay they're not Solzhenitsyn they're literally getting front-page photo spreads in mainstream American newspapers I'm supposed to believe that these people are victims the media are so enthralled with themselves over over their own behavior under the Trump administration no wonder Trump is tempted to just spit in their eye on a regular basis I can't blame him for that I can blame him for picking people without vetting them but I can't blame him for spitting in the item media because the media really are wild okay time for a thing I like and then we'll do a thing that I hate so first the thing I like so yesterday on the plane I had the chance to watch only the brave I really have chances to watch movies only when my wife is working late at the hospital or when I'm on a plane so I watched only the brave only some of it on the plane yesterday it's really good movie was first recommended to me actually by my friend Dana Perino and she raved about it it's worth it's worth the rave it's it's really solid here's a little bit of the trailer from only the brave I work this plays nearly 110 and the blink of an eye just fire everywhere and then charging out of these flames comes this bear on fire was most beautiful and terrible thing I've ever seen I heard you guys had some slots available you lost got one slide open you know what we're training for hotshots get to engage the fire directly the SEAL Team six with fire fun if you give me a chance I won't let you down sooner or later the fire is gonna come out get in our home - been trying it for over four years and got all our hours all our qualifications but until we're certified hotshots my crew won't even be able to set foot on the line I told it would be easy okay so the movie is is quite good it's really effective I think it's it's quite moving so check it out if you haven't a chance to yet check out only the brave okay time for a thing that I hate so yesterday I didn't have time to to pay tribute to the Armenian Genocide simply because we ran out of time on the show but I want to do it today so yesterday marked the the opening of the Armenian Genocide the Armenian Genocide was actually a series of genocides and they were basically religious wars by Muslims against Christians okay let's be real about this the Armenian Genocide had to do with ethnicity but it also had a large component to do with religion you know on yesterday's date in 1915 hundreds of Armenians intellectuals Christians for the most part were forcibly deported from the Turkish capital of Constantinople the number of soon escalated into the thousands most were eventually murdered that kicked off the Armenian Genocide the persecution of Christians Armenians by Muslim young turks who wanted to cleanse the new country of the troublesome non co-religionists in preparation for the new regime in Turkey in the aftermath of the collapse of the Ottoman Empire by the time the genocide was over it lasted from 1915 all the way to 1923 hundreds of thousands of Armenians were dead top range estimates put the number at 1.5 million and there are massive atrocities we're talking about putting our meaning in children on boats and then sinking them in in lakes we're talking about forced death marches or talk about mass shootings CNN reports the death toll is in dispute but photograph from the era document some mass killings some show Ottoman soldiers posing the severed heads others with them standing amid skulls in the dirt the victims are reported to have died in mass burnings by doing and by drowning tortured gasps poisoned disease and starvation children reporters have been loaded onto boats taken out to sea and thrown overboard and of course rape was frequently reported now what's amazing is that so many countries still refused to use the term Armenian Genocide the United States and Israel among them both of those countries should immediately use the term Armenian Genocide it is absurd not to recognize the truth of the Armenian Genocide and not to recognize also that the Armenian Genocide was the predecessor for the Holocaust the current dictator of Turkey who is in Islamist himself Recep Tayyip Erdogan and a terrorist supporter and a radical Muslim has threatened multiple foreign countries if they use that in 2010 everyone openly warned he could throw a hundred thousand Armenian immigrants out of Turkey he said there are currently 170,000 Armenians living in our country only seventy thousand of them are Turkish citizens but we are tolerant tolerating the remaining 100,000 if necessary I may have to tell these 100,000 to go back to their country because they are not my citizens I don't have to keep them in my country so when I say that the Armenian Genocide was the predecessor for the Holocaust there were German staffers I mean the Germans were allied with the Ottomans in World War one there were German staffers in the army who were present at the happening of the Armenian Genocide I had Hitler's confidence as schmuely but a point out learned from Turkey's genocidal playbook his lead political adviser Hitler's lead political adviser was max or when von Schuch nur Richter who's a young German consular office in Ayers Iran during World War one which was a region of Turkey populated with Armenians turkeys ethnic cleansing in World War one was well known and admired by Nazi ideologues in 1923 journalist Hans Trapster wrote in the Nazi newspaper hi Midland these bloodsuckers and parasites Greeks and Armenians have been eradicated by the Turks and of course they're in in one of his speeches Hitler apparently this is sort of controversial but he apparently made reference to the Armenian Genocide if the world didn't care when the Turks were slaughtering the Armenians they're not going to care when we go after all of our enemies so it is important to recognize genocides when when they are occurring it is important particularly in an era of continued religious conflict to recognize the religious components out of the Armenian Genocide as well okay I want to take one second here and analyze the Federalist paper we missed it this week so Federalist 25 we were all the way up to Federalist 25 this one is written by Alexander Hamilton and in this Federalist paper Hamilton is still talking about the necessity for common defense he's still talking about why we ought to have a standing army at the national level he makes a couple of arguments that are really interesting so his first argument makes him sense he says we need a standing army because if somebody attacks us and we don't have a standing army we're screwed okay that's pretty obvious but then he makes another argument that I think we'd be welted to take in mind he says that a national standing army would be better than standing armies on behalf of the states why he says the liberty of the people would be less safe in this state of things than in that in which the National forces were left in the hands of the national government as far as an army may be considered Dane as ad weapon of power and had better be in those hands of which the people are most likely to be jealous than in those of which they are least likely to be jealous for it is a truth which the experience of Ages has attested that the people are always most in danger when the means of injuring their rights are in the possession of those of whom that they entertain the least suspicion has a really deep point you know I'm fisk aided by some of the language here but what Hamilton is actually saying is that you should distrust the national government he's saying the reason that you can trust the national governments we have a standing army is because you distrust the national government to do the right thing which means that if they do the wrong thing people will leave the army or people in the states will rise up and resist them furthermore he says people are always in the most danger when the means of injuring their rights are in the hands of friends this is 100% true it's one of the reasons why I think even my own political viewpoint has changed over the years I was much more kind of traditionally conservative and less libertarian when I was 19 than I am now one of the reasons is because when you're a young conservative growing up under the Bush administration you figure okay I like George W Bush I don't mind that the government has more power and then Obama becomes present you say well this kind of sucks I don't like that the government has this much power and then the question becomes okay when you have a Republican again they're gonna go back to the idea that power is only a matter of who uses it or you're gonna say that there's an inherent risk to the national government having the kind of power that can be wielded by your political enemies and therefore we should minimize that amount of power and that's what Hamilton is really saying underneath the surface there okay so we'll be back here tomorrow with more again it's been just an honor to be here at Liberty University what an incredible institution it is the kids here are just amazing and I can't speak highly enough about what the students here are doing for their community and for the world just a terrific terrific University I will be back here tomorrow I'm Ben
