1
00:00:00,666 --> 00:00:01,934
WE HAVE TO VIEW OUR ROLE.

2
00:00:01,934 --> 00:00:03,202
THERE ARE DIFFERENCES OF

3
00:00:03,202 --> 00:00:03,536
OPINION.

4
00:00:03,536 --> 00:00:06,505
WE AS FRIENDS CAN DISCUSS THAT

5
00:00:06,505 --> 00:00:06,839
OPENLY.

6
00:00:06,839 --> 00:00:08,407
>> THANK YOU, CHANCELLOR.

7
00:00:08,407 --> 00:00:10,509
WE NEED A RECIPROCAL

8
00:00:10,509 --> 00:00:13,446
RELATIONSHIP, WHICH WE DON'T

9
00:00:13,446 --> 00:00:13,746
HAVE.

10
00:00:13,746 --> 00:00:14,980
THE UNITED STATES RIGHT NOW HAS

11
00:00:14,980 --> 00:00:17,383
A TRADE DEFICIT WITH THE

12
00:00:17,383 --> 00:00:21,153
EUROPEAN UNION OF $151 BILLION.

13
00:00:21,153 --> 00:00:22,288
THE CHANCELLOR AND I HAVE

14
00:00:22,288 --> 00:00:23,756
DISCUSSED IT TODAY AT LENGTH.

15
00:00:23,756 --> 00:00:25,091
WE'RE WORKING ON IT.

16
00:00:25,091 --> 00:00:26,959
WE WANT TO MAKE IT MORE FAIR.

17
00:00:26,959 --> 00:00:28,394
THE CHANCELLOR WANTS TO MAKE IT

18
00:00:28,394 --> 00:00:28,928
MORE FAIR.

19
00:00:28,928 --> 00:00:30,062
SAME WITH NATO.

20
00:00:30,062 --> 00:00:32,064
WE HAVE A FAR GREATER BURDEN

21
00:00:32,064 --> 00:00:33,199
THAN WE SHOULD HAVE.

22
00:00:33,199 --> 00:00:34,867
OTHER COUNTRIES SHOULD BE PAYING

23
00:00:34,867 --> 00:00:35,434
MORE.

24
00:00:35,434 --> 00:00:37,636
I'M NOT SAYING GERMANY ALONE.

25
00:00:37,636 --> 00:00:39,605
OTHER COUNTRIES SHOULD BE PAYING

26
00:00:39,605 --> 00:00:40,139
MORE.

27
00:00:40,139 --> 00:00:42,308
WE'RE PROTECTING EUROPE, AND YET

28
00:00:42,308 --> 00:00:44,076
WE PAY BY FAR MORE THAN ANYBODY

29
00:00:44,076 --> 00:00:44,410
ELSE.

30
00:00:44,410 --> 00:00:46,645
NATO IS WONDERFUL, BUT IT HELPS

31
00:00:46,645 --> 00:00:48,614
EUROPE MORE THAN IT HELPS US.

32
00:00:48,614 --> 00:00:51,250
WHY ARE WE PAYING A VAST

33
00:00:51,250 --> 00:00:52,051
MAJORITY OF THE COSTS?

34
00:00:52,051 --> 00:00:54,086
SO WE'RE WORKING ON THOSE

35
00:00:54,086 --> 00:00:54,453
THINGS.

36
00:00:54,453 --> 00:00:55,888
IT'S BEEN UNFAIR.

37
00:00:55,888 --> 00:00:57,256
I DON'T BLAME THE CHANCELLOR.

38
00:00:57,256 --> 00:00:58,791
I DON'T BLAME GERMANY.

39
00:00:58,791 --> 00:01:00,326
I DON'T BLAME THE EUROPEAN

40
00:01:00,326 --> 00:01:00,626
UNION.

41
00:01:00,626 --> 00:01:02,027
I BLAME THE PEOPLE PRECEDING ME

42
00:01:02,027 --> 00:01:03,329
FOR ALLOWING THIS TO HAPPEN.

43
00:01:03,329 --> 00:01:05,230
THERE'S NO WAY WE SHOULD HAVE A

44
00:01:05,230 --> 00:01:07,800
TRADE DEFICIT OF $151 BILLION.

45
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:10,503
SO WE'RE GOING TO MAKE IT

46
00:01:10,503 --> 00:01:10,903
RECIPROCAL.

47
00:01:10,903 --> 00:01:14,607
WE'RE GOING TO MAKE IT A MUCH

48
00:01:14,607 --> 00:01:16,008
MORE FAIR SITUATION.

49
00:01:16,008 --> 00:01:17,643
AND I THINK IN THE END,

50
00:01:17,643 --> 00:01:19,678
EVERYBODY'S GOING TO BE VERY

51
00:01:19,678 --> 00:01:19,979
HAPPY.

52
00:01:19,979 --> 00:01:21,981
I THINK BOTH COUNTRIES, I VIEW

53
00:01:21,981 --> 00:01:23,616
THIS AS MANY COUNTRIES.

54
00:01:23,616 --> 00:01:26,652
BUT LOOKING AT IT AS ONE BLOCK,

55
00:01:26,652 --> 00:01:27,987
WILL REALLY BENEFIT.

56
00:01:27,987 --> 00:01:30,923
THERE'S TREMENDOUS, TREMENDOUS

57
00:01:30,923 --> 00:01:32,925
POTENTIAL BETWEEN THE EUROPEAN

58
00:01:32,925 --> 00:01:34,226
UNION AND THE UNITED STATES.

59
00:01:34,226 --> 00:01:36,162
AND I THINK THAT'S GOING TO

60
00:01:36,162 --> 00:01:36,495
HAPPEN.

61
00:01:36,495 --> 00:01:38,898
THERE'S ALSO TREMENDOUS BENEFIT

62
00:01:38,898 --> 00:01:40,466
TO NATO WHEN PEOPLE PAY WHAT

63
00:01:40,466 --> 00:01:42,201
THEY HAVE TO BE PAYING.

64
00:01:42,201 --> 00:01:45,071
SOME COUNTRIES PAY MORE.

65
00:01:45,071 --> 00:01:47,006
THEY THINK THE UNITED STATES IS

66
00:01:47,006 --> 00:01:49,175
-- I HAVE BEEN TOLD BY NUMEROUS

67
00:01:49,175 --> 00:01:49,609
COUNTRIES.

68
00:01:49,609 --> 00:01:50,610
POLAND BEING ONE.

69
00:01:50,610 --> 00:01:52,378
THEY PAY ACTUALLY A LITTLE BIT

70
00:01:52,378 --> 00:01:53,813
MORE THAN THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO BE

71
00:01:53,813 --> 00:01:54,947
PAYING OR HAVE TO PAY BECAUSE

72
00:01:54,947 --> 00:01:55,881
THEY FEEL THE UNITED STATES IS

73
00:01:55,881 --> 00:01:58,117
MORE THAN CARRYING THE LOAD.

74
00:01:58,117 --> 00:01:59,719
PERHAPS THEY FEEL IT'S NOT FAIR.

75
00:01:59,719 --> 00:02:03,889
BUT IT'S SOMETHING WE VERY MUCH

76
00:02:03,889 --> 00:02:13,199
APPRECIATE.

77
00:02:13,199 --> 00:02:15,301
THEY MAY NOT LIKE DONALD TRUMP.

78
00:02:15,301 --> 00:02:17,336
THAT MEANS I'M DOING A GOOD JOB.

79
00:02:17,336 --> 00:02:20,206
I'M REPRESENTING THE UNITED

80
00:02:20,206 --> 00:02:21,574
STATES.

81
00:02:21,574 --> 00:02:29,515
ANGELA IS REPRESENTING GERMANY.

82
00:02:29,515 --> 00:02:30,916
WE'LL TRY AND CATCH YOU.

83
00:02:30,916 --> 00:00:00,000
WE'RE GOING TO HAVE A RECIPROCAL
