Laura: THE AHS SECRETARY WILL BE UNVEILING THE POLICY. COMING UP, A HIGH DIVE OFF THE DEEP END. HIS PIECE ON WEDNESDAY WAS HEADLINED TRUMP IS NO LONGER THE WORST PERSON IN GOVERNMENT. NO. NOT SCOTT PRUETT, NO. IT'S VICE PRESIDENT MIKE PENCE. LOW KEY, SELF-EFFACING AND LOYAL MIKE PENCE, HOW COULD THAT BE? GEORGE WILL HAS A CON FISHCY GEORGE WILL HAS A CON FI CCY GEORGE WILL HAS A CON FI CONSPIR GEORGE WILL HAS A CON FI CONSPIC GEORGE WILL HAS A CON FI CONSPI. HE COULD BECOME THE MOST REPULSIVE FIGURE. TRUMP PICKED PENCE BECAUSE AMERICA WOULD HAVE SUCH REVULSION FOR HIS VP, IT WOULD TAKE THE HEAT OFF THE PRESIDENT HIMSELF. WHAT MAKES PENCE SO REPULSIVE? WILL CITED THE POST CALCULATIONS THAT DURING A CABINET MEETING PENCE PRAISED TRUMP ONCE EVERY 12 SECOND FOR THREE MINUTES WITH SUCH COMMENTS AS, QUOTE, I AM DEEPLY HUMBLED. HE DOESN'T FIND THE HUMILITY REPULSIVE, HE SEEMS TO HAVE SOME KIND OF ISSUE WITH PENCE'S FACE. THE FAVORITE PINUPS, THE SPIRIT AND THE VICIOUS PORTION REQUIRE. WILL WAS OFFENDED THAT PENCE WOULD CALL HIMSELF HONORED BY THE PRESENCE OF FORMER SHERIFF JOE APIYO. HE CALLED HIM A TIRELESS CHAMPION OF THE RULE OF LAW. ACCORDING TO THE REPULSIVE HUMILITY, RESPECT FOR THE LAW, MAKE HIM THE AUTHENTIC VOICE OF TODAY'S REPUBLICAN PARTY. WELL, THE ACCUSATIONS WERE PICKED UP BY THE FEEDBACK LOOP ON THE LEFT AS AN OPPORTUNITY TO SMEAR THE VICE PRESIDENT. WHO IS MIKE PENCE? I DON'T KNOW. HE DOESN'T SEEM TO HAVE CORE CONVICTS OR BELIEFS BEYOND WHATEVER DONALD TRUMP DECIDED THEY ARE. HE'S STRIKING THIS BALANCE, TRYING TO BE THE MAN THAT WILL INHERIT THE MANTLE OF TRUMP. THERE ARE TWO VICE PRESIDENTS. THOSE ACCUSED OF BEING OUT FOR THEMSELVES THAT THEY ARE NOT SERVING THE PRESIDENT WHO PICKED THEM AND THOSE ACCUSED OF BEING SLAVISHLY LOYAL LAP DOGS. MIKE PENCE DECIDED TO BE THE LATTER. HE IS A TITANIC FRAUD. HE'S THE MOST OF ALL THE CULTISTS IN THE CABINET. WE HAVE NEVER SEEN SUCH SLOBBERINGER SLOBBERING IN THIS COUNTRY THAN WE DO WITH MIKE PENCE. Laura: CONSIDER THE SOURCE, MY FRIEND. IS PENCE REALLY THE WORST PERSON IN GOVERNMENT? WHY ARE THE PENCE HATERS LASHING OUT NOW? IT'S INTERESTING. LET'S ASK MARK LOTTER, AND DEMOCRATIC PARTY ACTIVIST, CHRIS HAN. MARK, LET'S GO TO YOU. I HAVE KNOWN MIKE PENCE WHEN HE WAS IN CONGRESS. I FOUND THAT FROM GEORGE WILL REALLY SAD. HE'S HAD AN UNBELIEVABLE CAREER AS ONE OF THE PREMIER COLUMNISTS, WRITERS IN THE UNITED STATES, HE DOESN'T LIKE DONALD TRUMP, THAT'S FINE. BUT I THOUGHT IT WAS FILLED WITH SUCH LOW BLOWS. I WASN'T EVEN ANGRY ABOUT IT. I WAS SAD ABOUT IT. IN 1986 HE WROTE A COLUMN CALLED THEN VICE PRESIDENT GEORGE BUSH A LAP DOG. HE WOULD GO ON TO BE A TRANSFORMATIONAL PRESIDENT. HE HAS A PROBLEM WITH VICE PRESIDENTS WHO SERVE PRESIDENTS OF THE UNITED STATES. TO GET TO USE A BASEBALL TERM I KNOW GEORGE WOULD LIKE, THE BEST PLAYERS IN THE WORLD MISS SEVEN OUT OF TEN TIMES. HE STRUCK OUT IN THE DIRT. Laura: THERE WERE OVERTONES IN THIS COLUMN. HE WAS PICKED UP BY MEDIA FIGURES. HE TALKS ABOUT HOW HE GENUFLEX AT THE ALTER. IT SEEMED CONDESCENDING ABOUT MIKE PENCE'S FACE, QUESTIONING HIS FACE, YOU ARE NOT A REAL QUESTION. HE DIDN'T WRITE THAT. YOU CAN READ BETWEEN THE LINES. I LIKE GEORGE WILL. A LOT OF PEOPLE DON'T LIKE HIM. I HAVE KNOWN HIM FOR A LONG TIME. IT PAINS ME TO SAY THIS, BUT I THOUGHT THE COLUMN WAS BENEATH HIM AND FILLED WITH LOW BLOWS AND NOT AT ALL IN ANY WAY ILLUSTRATIVE OF THE MAN WHO MIKE PENCE IS. HE'S A WONDERFUL PERSON AND I THINK A VERY EFFECTIVE VICE PRESIDENT. THE COLUMN GOT PICKED UP BROADLY BECAUSE THE VICE PRESIDENT DECIDED TO PLAGIARIZE RICHARD NIXON. WHILE I DO THINK THE TONE WAS HARSH, IT'S NOT LIKE GEORGE WILL SAID HIS OPINION DOESN'T MATTER BECAUSE HE'S ABOUT TO DIE, WHICH IS SOMETHING THAT'S BEEN SAID INSIDE THE WHITE HOUSE THESE DAYS. WE GOT TO BACK OFF ON THIS IS SUCH A BAD THING. THE VICE PRESIDENT IS THE BOOT-LIQUOR IN CHIEF IN THIS ADMINISTRATION. HE PRAISES THE PRESIDENT, HE KISSES HIS BUTT. WHAT'S SAD, IN TO 20 THIS PRESIDENT WILL DROP HIM FROM THE TICKET BECAUSE THIS PRESIDENT CARES ABOUT RATINGS. WHO HE PICKS AT THE CONVENTION WILL BE THE BIGGEST RATINGS NIGHT OF THAT WEEK. MR. PENCE, YOU MIGHT WANT TO STAND UP TO THIS PRESIDENT BECAUSE HE'S NOT GOING TO STAND BY YOU IN THE END. Laura: WERE YOU CONCERNED ABOUT VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN TAKING ON OBAMA? I'M TRYING TO REMEMBER, WAIT, HE NEVER DID. WHEN DID VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN TAKE ON OBAMA FOR CREWING UP THE HEALTHCARE WEBSITE, FOR HOUNDING PEOPLE WHO APPLIED FOR IRS STATUS. WHEN DID BIDEN COME OUT AND CHALLENGE OBAMA'S ABUSE OF POWER? NEVER. WHY GO AFTER MIKE PENCE. YOU DIDN'T CRITICIZE BIDEN BECAUSE HIS ROLE IS TO SUPPORT THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. WHY IS MIKE PENCE BEING ATTACKED? IT'S ABOUT PRIDE AND EVE GO OF THESE NEVER-TRUMP WRITERS. THEY CAN'T ADMIT THE AAGAIN TODAY IS THE MOST CONSERVATIVE AGENDA. MIKE PENCE, A MAN WITH A 99% VOTING RECORD, I DON'T KNOW WHAT HE EVER GOT WRONG, BUT HE GOT ONE THING WRONG, ONE TIME, IN ALL THE TIME IN CONGRESS, YOU GET ATTACKED BY THESE PEOPLE BECAUSE THEY THINK WE ARE DEPLORABLE. THEY DON'T THINK WE HAVE ANY MORAL STANDING TO MAKE THE CASE THAT WHAT DONALD TRUMP IS DOING IS THE RIGHT THING. Laura: WHEN HILLARY TALKED ABOUT THE BASKET OF DEPLORABLES. GEORGE WILL, IN THIS MOMENT, HAS MORE IN COMMON WITH THEIR VIEW OF MIDDLE AMERICA FROM WHERE MIKE PENCE CAME THAN HE DOES WITH THE CONSERVATIVE VOTERS ACROSS AMERICA WHO SAID WE ARE ARE GOING TO TAKE SOMEBODY WHO TAKES A WRECKING BALL. IT'S UNBECOMING. MILLIONS OF AMERICANS ARE HORRIBLE, AWFUL, RACIST, TERRIBLE PEOPLE. REALLY? GOOD LUCK BUILDING A MOVEMENT ON THAT DAY. THIS IS NOT THE FIRST TIME THIS HAPPENED. SAME THING HAPPENED IN 1980 WHEN THE AMERICAN PEOPLE TURNED THEIR BACK ON THE REPUBLICANS. THEY DID IT IN PRESIDENT TRUMP AND THE ELITISTS CAN'T GET OVER IT. Laura: TRUMP DOESN'T KEEP A THEY SORRIES BY HIS BED. IT'S THE SEVEN SYLLABLE WORDS. I LIKE THAT. BUT GO AHEAD, CHRIS. MY CONCERN HERE IS THAT THE TIMING OF THIS IS CURIOUS, THEY ARE STRIKING OUT ON TRUMP. TRUMP'S NUMBERS ARE GOING UP. THEY THINK THEY CAN GET SOMETHING ON PENCE. TRUMP'S NUMBERS ARE IMPROVING BECAUSE THE RESULTS ARE THERE FOR THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. NOBODY IS GOING TO BASE THEIR NUMBERS ON TRUMP ON WHAT PENCE IS DOING. I THINK GEORGE WILL HAD A FEELING ABOUT MIKE PENCE BASED ON WHAT HAPPENED IN ARIZONA WHEN HE WENT OUT THERE. A LOT OF PEOPLE HAVE REASON TO THINK JOE IS SOMEBODY WHO NOT BE TOUTED BY THE VICE PRESIDENT OR THE PRESIDENT. HE DISOBEYED A COURT ORDER WHAT HE DID WAS RACIST. SO I THINK GEORGE WILL SEES THAT. THIS IS NOT THE REPUBLICAN PARTY, THIS IS NOT THE CONSERVATIVE MOVEMENT HE GREW UP WITH. HE WOULD LIKE TO SEE MIKE PENCE BE THE BACKBONE TO CONSERVATIVISM. MIKE PENCE HAS BEEN A CONSERVATIVE ALL HIS LIFE. SO IF HE'S BECOMING MORE LIKE DONALD TRUMP, THEN CONSERVATIVES WILL HAVE A PROBLEM WITH THAT. THAT'S WHAT HE WAS LASHING OUT ABOUT IT. YOU WANT PEOPLE TO TALK ABOUT IT, YOU BETTER SAY SOME CRAZY THINGS. YOU ARE GOING GOOD. ALL I WOULD SAY THIS, DO WE WANT TO WIN OR DO WE NOT WANT TO WIN? IF THE PRESIDENT TALKED ABOUT WINNING. CONSERVATIVES ARE GETTING MORE DONE. WE ARE IN A WINDOW Laura: AZAR IS GOING TO BE BIG. HE CLERKED WITH ME. HE COULD HAVE BEEN A CABINET SECRETARY. HE'S DOING THIS BECAUSE WE GOT TO GET THIS PRESCRIPTION DRUG STUFF, THIS HAS TO BE TACKLED. HE WILL DO A LOT MORE. THESE HOLD ON, CHRIS. THESE ARE PEOPLE OF REAL SUBSTANCE WHO ARE DOING REALLY HARD WORK. I THINK IT REALLY URKS PEOPLE. WHEN STEVE SCHMIDT, BECAUSE HE RAN A GREAT CAMPAIGN WITH PAILEN. WE HAVE LISTENED TO THIS GUY FOR MANY YEARS ON HIS MORAL HIGH HORSE. ASSAULTING THE DIGNITY OF GUY PEOPLE, ACROSS THE BOARD. HIS MORAL PREENING IS FAMOUS THROUGHOUT THE LAND. Laura: HE JUST SWORE IN A GUY AMERICAN TO BE A NEW AMBASSADOR TO GERMANY. SO IF YOU ARE A FAITHFUL CHRISTIAN AS HE IS, HE'S, BY NATURE HOMOPHOBIC. YOU CAN'T DISAGREE. IT'S A LITANY. HE PANDERS TO PEOPLE WHO ARE HOMOPHOBIC. I THINK THIS IS A GREAT THING FOR THE COUNTRY, THE ADMINISTRATION AND AMERICA. LOOK AT THE TIMING. IF YOU LOOK AT THE POLLS, IT'S THE RIGHT TRACK, WRONG TRACK, IMPROVING. TRUMPS NUMBERS GET BETTER. YOU KNOW THE ONLY PLACE HE'S WEAK? FOREIGN AFFAIRS. WHAT THE DEMOCRATS ARE SEEING IS THIS BIG BLUE WAVE IS STARTING TO GO AWAY. Laura: CHRIS, I WANT TO PLAY A BYTE FROM NICOLE WALLACE. WHY CAN'T YOU SAY IF HE SAYS THAT, SHE WILL BE FIRED. Laura: HOW DO YOU RESIST THE TEMPTATION TO RUN UP AND RING HER NECK? SHE SAID IT'S GETTING TO HER, USED POORLY CHOSEN WORD. FOR THAT I'M SORRY. THEY ARE TALKING ABOUT THE COMMENT MADE BY STADLER. IT WAS MADE IN PRIVATE. WELL, HOLD ON A MINUTE, GUYS. YOU KNOW, LOOK, MATT, MATT, NICOLE APOLOGIZED, THE WHITE HOUSE SHOULD APOLOGIZE ABOUT THE AMERICAN HERO. I DON'T KNOW WHY? JOHN McCAIN, I DON'T AGREE WITH JOHN McCAIN ON A LOT OF THINGS, HE IS A HERO. YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT HAPPENED IN A PRIVATE MEETING. NONE OF US KNOWS. THEY ADMITTED IT. I THINK JOHN McCAIN DESERVES HIS PEACE AND QUIET. BUT HE STILL HAS A VOTING RECORD. IT'S OKAY TO TALK ABOUT IT AND OKAY TO TALK ABOUT HIM OPPOSING THE PRESIDENT'S NOMINEE. Laura: YOU KNOW WHAT JOHN McCAIN SAID? MATT, SO MUCH RHETORIC THAT NEEDS TO CALM DOWN, IT START AT THE TOP, STARTS WITH THE PRESIDENT. NOW YOU ARE GOING TO ATTACK Laura: WELL, I THINK CHRIS, CHRIS, WE CAN GO BACK AND I CAN CHERRY PICK THE BRIGHT LIGHTS OF THE LEFT AND THE ENTERTAINMENT INDUSTRY AND MEDIA, NOW WE ARE THREATENING TO CHOKE PEOPLE. WE ARE GOING TO BLOW THE WHITE HOUSE UP. IF WE ARE GOING TO TALK ABOUT VITREAL, CHECK OUT MY TWITTER FEED. AND MINE. Laura: DON'T PRETEND TO BE LIKE THESE SHRINKING VIOLETS. JOHN McCAIN IS A HERO. HE DISAGREED WITH THE PRESIDENT. HE SAID DON'T FEEL SORRY FOR ME. I'M GOING TO FIGHT MY FIGHT, HE'S NOT SOMEONE WHO WANT TO BE TREATED WITH KIT GLOVES. HE'S A TOUGH GUY WHO CAN HANDLE HIMSELF AND HE'S AN AMAZING PERSON. IT'S EASY FOR THE WHITE HOUSE TO SAY THAT WAS UNFORTUNATE, WE APOLOGIZE. THEY ARE GOING THROUGH A TRYING TIME. CALL THEM. LET'S NOT TRY SHE CALLED MEGAN McCAIN. SARAH NEEDS TO SAY SOMETHING FROM THE PODIUM. WE HAVE POLICY DISAGREEMENTS WITH MSNBC. HE CALLS THE PRESIDENT AND ACTS LIKE HE HAS THE MORAL HIGH GROUND. SAME THING FOR NICOLE AND THESE PEOPLE WHO ATTACK ALL OF US REPUBLICAN WHOSE STAND WITH THE PRESIDENT. IT'S DIFFERENT WHEN IT COMES FROM THE WHITE HOUSE. YOU USED TO WORK THERE. MY WIFE WORKS THERE, AND I DON'T THINK YOU SHOULD SMUDGE THE CHARACTERS. I'M NOT. THEY ARE SMUDGING THEIR OWN CHARACTERS. Laura: MOCKING PEOPLE'S FACE, IF IT WERE DONE AGAINST ANIS ISLAMIC INDIVIDUAL, MIKE PENCE HAS BEEN MOCKED REPEATEDLY BY THE POPULAR CULTURE THAT ARE FANS AND FANATICS OF THE LEFT. IT'S BEEN TOLERATED, IT'S A WINK AND NOD. THEY THINK CHRISTIANS ARE STUPID. ANYONE WHO SUPPORTS TRUMP IS AN IDIOT. I THINK IT'S BACKFIRING.
