00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,220
hi everyone how's it going for almost

2
00:00:02,220 --> 00:00:03,899
five<font color="#CCCCCC"> years now I've been on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> YouTube</font>

3
00:00:03,899 --> 00:00:07,140
creating videos trying to find projects

4
00:00:07,140 --> 00:00:08,820
that could really inspire people around

5
00:00:08,820 --> 00:00:11,130
the world to do what they love to do but

6
00:00:11,130 --> 00:00:12,780
no matter how passionate you are about

7
00:00:12,780 --> 00:00:14,670
helping other people in the world you

8
00:00:14,670 --> 00:00:16,320
must<font color="#E5E5E5"> be standing on a strong foundation</font>

9
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:19,529
and that does require responsibility for

10
00:00:19,529 --> 00:00:21,570
one's self this was certainly a lesson

11
00:00:21,570 --> 00:00:23,100
<font color="#CCCCCC">that took me many years to figure out</font>

12
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:25,199
<font color="#E5E5E5">I'm having episodes of depression where</font>

13
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:26,910
I was so worried<font color="#CCCCCC"> about those that I was</font>

14
00:00:26,910 --> 00:00:29,279
trying to<font color="#CCCCCC"> help out or even times where I</font>

15
00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:31,289
was helping people<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then when</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> they</font>

16
00:00:31,289 --> 00:00:32,668
achieved what they wanted to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do they</font>

17
00:00:32,668 --> 00:00:35,010
never bothered to turn back and help me

18
00:00:35,010 --> 00:00:37,140
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> return I began to understand that I</font>

19
00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:39,210
needed<font color="#E5E5E5"> to take</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> care of my own emotional</font>

20
00:00:39,210 --> 00:00:40,860
and physical well-being and then it

21
00:00:40,860 --> 00:00:42,750
would<font color="#CCCCCC"> be at that point</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I would then have</font>

22
00:00:42,750 --> 00:00:44,070
the strength to help others more

23
00:00:44,070 --> 00:00:46,530
effectively from<font color="#E5E5E5"> a psychology degree to</font>

24
00:00:46,530 --> 00:00:48,629
BBC television to construction to

25
00:00:48,629 --> 00:00:50,730
unemployment I have really been on a

26
00:00:50,730 --> 00:00:53,430
huge financial roller coaster but my

27
00:00:53,430 --> 00:00:55,680
focus in life to use this technology to

28
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:57,750
bring the world together has not changed

29
00:00:57,750 --> 00:01:00,570
if anything it's evolved last year was

30
00:01:00,570 --> 00:01:02,730
invited by Sky News to talk about<font color="#CCCCCC"> making</font>

31
00:01:02,730 --> 00:01:04,739
money on youtube in which I stood up<font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font>

32
00:01:04,739 --> 00:01:06,510
the community<font color="#CCCCCC"> and I said but I think</font>

33
00:01:06,510 --> 00:01:08,460
<font color="#CCCCCC">that we need to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be realistic here the</font>

34
00:01:08,460 --> 00:01:10,110
majority<font color="#CCCCCC"> of people who are partners</font>

35
00:01:10,110 --> 00:01:12,450
aren't making<font color="#E5E5E5"> profit and honestly I</font>

36
00:01:12,450 --> 00:01:14,310
<font color="#CCCCCC">think my bluntness really pissed YouTube</font>

37
00:01:14,310 --> 00:01:15,900
and Google off at that time I didn't

38
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:17,070
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> I was ever going to hear from them</font>

39
00:01:17,070 --> 00:01:19,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">again where was only a few</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> weeks ago</font>

40
00:01:19,170 --> 00:01:21,060

45
00:01:29,970 --> 00:01:33,060
knew of anyone who created content and

46
00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:34,950
knew the logistics of viral marketing

47
00:01:34,950 --> 00:01:37,439
and online community they gave one named

49
00:01:40,860 --> 00:01:42,470
just a complete shock<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the system</font>

61
00:02:07,350 --> 00:02:09,149
vlogs projecting my train of thought in

62
00:02:09,149 --> 00:02:11,430
the comfort of my own home only to step

63
00:02:11,430 --> 00:02:12,810
forward and reveal that in fact this

64
00:02:12,810 --> 00:02:13,890
environment is full

65
00:02:13,890 --> 00:02:16,650
and is actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> a pretty epic studio</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">isn't this cool quite green so keeping</font>

00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:22,530
everything in mind there is<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

68
00:02:22,530 --> 00:02:24,360
correlation amongst<font color="#E5E5E5"> all these issues</font>

69
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:26,250
<font color="#CCCCCC">because</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> if I'm talking</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about helping</font>

70
00:02:26,250 --> 00:02:28,620
other people being financially secure

71
00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:30,810
having a dream job or implementing a

72
00:02:30,810 --> 00:02:32,250
video idea like the one I've just

73
00:02:32,250 --> 00:02:34,650
demonstrated it's all possible it just

74
00:02:34,650 --> 00:02:36,990
takes time passion and patience and

75
00:02:36,990 --> 00:02:38,790
whatever<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have your heart and mind</font>

76
00:02:38,790 --> 00:02:40,709
set on in life I'm not telling you this

77
00:02:40,709 --> 00:02:43,830
in the form of a empty cliche but in

78
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:46,739
conclusion to personal experience you

79
00:02:46,739 --> 00:02:49,260
really need to keep the faith after five

80
00:02:49,260 --> 00:02:50,760
years<font color="#E5E5E5"> I've finally been put in a</font>

81
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:52,620
position where I can represent the UK

82
00:02:52,620 --> 00:02:54,450
YouTube community in a significant way

83
00:02:54,450 --> 00:02:57,030
over the years it has evolved it was

84
00:02:57,030 --> 00:02:59,970
about setting up YouTube gatherings

85
00:02:59,970 --> 00:03:01,650
putting together teams for winning

86
00:03:01,650 --> 00:03:04,620
reality TV shows all great things but we

87
00:03:04,620 --> 00:03:07,110
should all admit that YouTube has become

88
00:03:07,110 --> 00:03:09,030
a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> more business orientated and there</font>

89
00:03:09,030 --> 00:03:10,709
is this kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of battle of doing what you</font>

90
00:03:10,709 --> 00:03:12,600
are really passionate about but also

91
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:15,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">being able to make money</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to financially</font>

92
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:17,640
support you in doing those things so I'm

93
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:19,380
now in a position where I can ensure you

94
00:03:19,380 --> 00:03:21,989
get paid to do what you love much more

95
00:03:21,989 --> 00:03:23,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">than what YouTube currently offers and</font>

96
00:03:23,810 --> 00:03:26,010
furthermore I'm now in a position to

97
00:03:26,010 --> 00:03:28,739
offer<font color="#E5E5E5"> you access to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> studios like this a</font>

98
00:03:28,739 --> 00:03:31,049
production team and decent equipment

99
00:03:31,049 --> 00:03:33,420
that will really allow them to upgrade

100
00:03:33,420 --> 00:03:35,160
the quality of their content I can do

101
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:39,299
tricks<font color="#E5E5E5"> like this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I can also</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> change my</font>

102
00:03:39,299 --> 00:03:43,260
environment hell I could<font color="#CCCCCC"> do whatever I</font>

103
00:03:43,260 --> 00:03:49,260
want just one<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing therefore I want to</font>

110
00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:06,269
too good to be true and to be honest I

111
00:04:06,269 --> 00:04:08,280
completely understand it was exactly<font color="#E5E5E5"> how</font>

112
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:10,079
I felt when I first came to this<font color="#E5E5E5"> company</font>
