>> Martha: ANY MINUTE,
PRESIDENT TRUMP IS SET TO TAKE
THE STAGE IN SOUTH CAROLINA TO
RALLY VOTES FOR GOVERNOR HENRY
McMASTER, WHOM HE STRONGLY
SUPPORTS.
BUT WHILE WE WAIT FOR THAT, MARK
WARNER REPORTING LAY JOKING TO
SAYING "IF YOU GET ME ONE MORE
GLASS OF WINE, I WILL TELL YOU
STUFF ONLY BOB MUELLER AND I
KNOW.
IF YOU THINK YOU'VE SEEN WILD
STUFF SO FAR, BUCKLE UP, IT WILL
BE A WILD COUPLE OF MONTHS."
SO DOES HE KNOW SOMETHING WE
DON'T?
HERE NOW IS JONATHAN SWANN, A
NATIONAL POLITICAL REPORTER.
WHAT ABOUT THAT COMMENT BY MIKE
WHAT ABOUT THAT COMMENT BY MIKEA
WHAT ABOUT THAT COMMENT BY MIKEK
WARNER?
>> JOKES ASIDE, HE PROBABLY
KNOWS VERY LITTLE COMPARED TO
BOB MUELLER.
IF YOU LOOK AT THE HIERARCHY OF
PEOPLE THAT KNOW, IT'S NO SECRET
THAT CONGRESSIONAL COMMITTEES
DON'T HAVE ANYTHING NEAR THE
POWERS THAT BOB MUELLER HAS, AND
PEOPLE ON THE COMMITTEE HAVE
JOKED TO ME THAT THEY DON'T KNOW
PROBABLY 50% OF WHAT BOB MUELLER
KNOWS.
SO THERE ARE PROBABLY VERY FEW
THINGS THAT JUST HE AND BOB
>> Martha: HOW SIGNIFICANT IS
PETER STRZOK AND HAVING HIM IN
FRONT OF THE COMMITTEE ON
WEDNESDAY?
OBVIOUSLY THIS IS A HUGE
DEVELOPMENT.
HE HAS SAID HE IS WILLING TO
>> I THINK IT WILL BE ONE OF THE
MOST POLITICALLY EXPLOSIVE
HEARINGS CERTAINLY OF THE YEAR,
PERHAPS THE LAST COUPLE OF
YEARS.
WE HAVE A LOT OF MEMBERS WHO ARE
DEEPLY ENGAGED ON THIS ISSUE.
PEOPLE LIKE JIM JORDAN, MARK
MEADOWS, THEY WILL BE VERY WELL
PREPARED AND VERY AGGRESSIVE IN
THEIR QUESTIONING, EVEN TREY
GOWDY WHO HAS BEEN MUCH MORE
MODERATE GENERALLY SPEAKING AS
OUTRAGED BY THIS ISSUE.
SO HE'S GOING TO COME UNDER
INTENSE QUESTIONING.
AND THERE IS A A LOT OF MATERIAL
TO WORK WITH.
>> Martha: TREY GOWDY HAS BEEN
VERY RESPECTFUL OF ROBERT
MUELLER AND HIS PROCESS, HE
HASN'T WANTED TO CRITICIZE THAT
IN ANY WAY.
BUT WHEN HE SAW THAT IG REPORT
HE WAS QUITE CLEAR THAT HE WAS
HORRIFIED BY THE WAY THAT THIS
HIGH LEVEL FBI AGENT WAS TALKING
ABOUT THE CASES THAT HE WAS
COVERING.
HERE'S A QUOTE FROM CHERYL
ATKINSON, WHO WROTE A COLUMN
ABOUT IT IN "THE HILL" TODAY.
SHE WRITES, "THE EARTH
HIGH-RANKING OFFICIAL ALLEGEDLY
CONSPIRING TO AFFECT THE OUTCOME
OF A PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION."
AND IF IT WEREN'T FOR THE IG
INVESTIGATION, HE WOULD LIKELY
TRUMP TODAY.
THOUGHTS ON THAT?
>> ANY FAIR READING OF THAT
REPORT, A READER WHO IS NOT
COLORED BIPARTISAN OBJECTIVES,
IF YOU JUST READ THE REPORT WITH
INTELLECTUAL HONESTY, YOU'LL
FIND THINGS IN THERE THAT HE HAS
SAID PRIVATELY THAT ARE
DISTURBING.
THAT YOU DON'T WANT TO SEE IN A
SENIOR INVESTIGATOR.
I CHALLENGE ANYONE TO SAY THAT,
AFTER A FAIR READING OF THAT
REPORT, THAT EVERYTHING IS FINE.
THAT BEING SAID TO COME UP THERE
AS AN INVESTIGATOR TO PUT HIS
THUMB ON THIS, BECAUSE IT'S
CLEAR WHERE HIS MIND WAS.
IT'S CLEAR WHAT HE WANTED TO
HAPPEN.
THE MISSING PIECE IS THE ACTION.
>> Martha: EVERYONE IS
FAMILIAR WITH THE TEXT MESSAGES,
WE CAN PUT THEM ON THE SCREEN.
THE ONE WHERE HE SAID, TRUMP IS
NEVER GOING TO BECOME PRESIDENT,
RIGHT, RIGHT?
AND THE RESPONSE FROM PAGE, NO,
WE WILL STOP IT.
ACTUALLY THAT WAS THE OTHER WAY
AROUND.
STRZOK WAS ANSWERING THEM.
AND THE ONE WE SAW I TELL MIKE A
LONG TIME AGO.
I'M AFRAID WE CAN'T TAKE THAT
RISK, IT'S LIKE AN INSURANCE
POLICY IN THE UNLIKELY EVENT
THAT YOU WILL DIE BEFORE YOUR
40.
SO THE QUESTION IS, HOW DID HE
ACT ON THAT?
AND I THINK ONE OF THE
INTERESTING THINGS IS GOING TO
BE AT THE QUESTIONS THAT GO
AROUND.
HOW DID YOU TREAT THE TWO
INVESTIGATIONS DIFFERENTLY?
BECAUSE HE WAS CENTRAL IN THE
HILLARY INVESTIGATION AS WELL AS
BEING CENTRAL IN THE
TRUMP-RUSSIA INVESTIGATION.
AND OF THE TREATMENT APPEARS TO
BE VERY DIFFERENT.
>> YES, BUT DIFFERENT IN A WAY
CERTAINLY DURING THE CAMPAIGN
SEASON THAT WAS ACTUALLY
ADVANTAGEOUS TO DONALD TRUMP.
WE DIDN'T KNOW THAT
DONALD TRUMP'S CAMPAIGN WAS
UNDER THE STATION DURING THE
CAMPAIGN AND WE SURE KNEW ABOUT
THE HILLARY CLINTON
INVESTIGATION.
SO THAT'S THE OTHER PIECE WHERE
THERE IS A MISSING LINK.
>> IF YOU LOOK AT THE WAY THAT
HILLARY'S PEOPLE WERE
INVESTIGATED, AND THE FACT THAT
THEY BEGAN PUTTING TOGETHER THAT
SHE WAS GUILTY BEFORE THE EVEN
SPOKE TO HER, I WOULD IMAGINE
WILL GET QUESTIONS ASKING AND
