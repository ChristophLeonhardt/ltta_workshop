1
00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:04,430
We have this idea that if we want to lose
weight, we join a gym on January 1st, we start

2
00:00:04,430 --> 00:00:07,299
working out regularly, and eventually we’ll
slim down.

3
00:00:07,299 --> 00:00:11,339
Well, here’s some bad news.
I read more than sixty studies on this, and

4
00:00:11,339 --> 00:00:15,709
it turns out exercise is actually pretty useless
when it comes to weight loss.

5
00:00:15,709 --> 00:00:21,070
Dr. Kevin Hall at the National Institutes of Health has done some of the most important studies

6
00:00:21,070 --> 00:00:24,630
on exercise and weight loss
We need to rebrand exercise … exercise isn’t

7
00:00:24,630 --> 00:00:29,480
a weight loss tool per se, it's excellent
for health is probably the best single thing

8
00:00:29,480 --> 00:00:32,949
that you can do other than stopping smoking
to improve your health.

9
00:00:32,949 --> 00:00:38,989
But don’t look at it as a weight loss tool.
Exercise will definitely help you live a longer,

10
00:00:38,989 --> 00:00:43,089
happier life…. It’s just not the best
way to lose weight. And the reason has to

11
00:00:43,089 --> 00:00:47,929
do with how our bodies use energy.
You may not realize it, but physical activity

12
00:00:47,929 --> 00:00:51,519
is actually a tiny component of your daily
energy burn.

13
00:00:51,519 --> 00:00:54,329
There are three main ways our bodies burn
calories.

14
00:00:54,329 --> 00:00:59,679
These include your resting metabolism, so
that's how much energy your body burns just

15
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:02,889
for its basic functioning, just to keep you
alive, basically.

16
00:01:02,889 --> 00:01:06,280
The other part of energy expenditure is the
thermic effect of food, and that’s just

17
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:09,750
how much energy is required to break food
down in your body.

18
00:01:09,750 --> 00:01:13,120
The third part of energy expenditure is physical
activity.

19
00:01:13,120 --> 00:01:17,300
For most people, physical activity - that’s
any movement you do, only accounts for about

20
00:01:17,300 --> 00:01:22,120
10 to 30 percent of energy use.
So the vast majority of energy or calories

21
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:27,920
you burn every day comes from your basal or
resting metabolism, over which you have very

22
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:31,740
little control.
While 100% of your “calories in” are up

23
00:01:31,740 --> 00:01:35,910
to you, only up to about 30% of your “calories
out” are in your control.

24
00:01:35,910 --> 00:01:40,670
One study found that if a 200-pound man ran
for an hour, 4 days a week for a month, he’d

25
00:01:40,670 --> 00:01:44,930
lose about 5 pounds at most, assuming everything
else stays the same.

26
00:01:44,930 --> 00:01:49,000
And everything else doesn’t stay the same!
Researchers have found we make all kinds of

27
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:54,030
behavioral and physiological adaptations when
we start increasing the amount of exercise

28
00:01:54,030 --> 00:01:57,390
we’re getting every day.
For one thing, exercise tends to make people

29
00:01:57,390 --> 00:01:59,710
hungry.
And I'm sure you know the feeling: you

30
00:01:59,710 --> 00:02:03,780
go for a spinning class in the morning, and
then by the time you eat breakfast you're

31
00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:08,580
so hungry you maybe double the size of the
portion of oatmeal you normally eat.

32
00:02:08,580 --> 00:02:12,750
There's also evidence to suggest that some
people simply slow down after a work out,

33
00:02:12,750 --> 00:02:16,420
so if you went running in the morning you
might be less inclined to take the stairs

34
00:02:16,420 --> 00:02:19,340
at work.
These are called “compensatory behaviors”

35
00:02:19,340 --> 00:02:23,090
-- the various ways we unknowingly undermine
our workouts.

36
00:02:23,090 --> 00:02:27,810
Researchers have also discovered a phenomenon
called metabolic compensation. As people start to

37
00:02:27,810 --> 00:02:30,940
slim down, their resting metabolism can slow down.

38
00:02:30,940 --> 00:02:34,980
So the amount of energy you burn while at rest is lower.

39
00:02:34,980 --> 00:02:38,290
That means this bar might shrink as you start to lose weight.

40
00:02:38,290 --> 00:02:43,020
There’s still a lot of research to be done,
but one study from 2012 is particularly interesting.

41
00:02:43,020 --> 00:02:48,530
They went out into the middle of the Savannah
in Tanzania to measure the energy burn among

42
00:02:48,530 --> 00:02:53,850
a group of hunter gathers called the Hadza.
These are super-active, lean hunter-gatherers.

43
00:02:53,850 --> 00:02:57,209
They’re not spending their days behind a computer at a desk.

44
00:02:57,209 --> 00:02:58,709
And what they found was shocking.

45
00:02:58,709 --> 00:03:01,169
What we found is that there was no difference at all.

46
00:03:01,169 --> 00:03:05,989
So even though the Hadza have a much more physically active lifestyle, they weren't burning any more

47
00:03:05,989 --> 00:03:08,149
calories every day than adults in the

48
00:03:08,149 --> 00:03:11,580
US and Europe.
Somehow the energy they used for physical

49
00:03:11,590 --> 00:03:18,150
activity was being offset or conserved elsewhere.
So how do they stay slim? They don’t overeat.

50
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:22,280
We can undo the calories that we burn off in exercise pretty quickly.

51
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:25,440
It would take about an hour of running to burn off a Big Mac and fries.

52
00:03:25,459 --> 00:03:30,430
You’d have to spend about an hour dancing
pretty vigorously to burn off three glasses

53
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:35,280
of wine you might drink with dinner.
An hour of cycling really intensely on exercise

54
00:03:35,290 --> 00:03:40,430
bikes to burn off about two doughnuts.
That’s why exercise is best seen as a healthy

55
00:03:40,430 --> 00:03:43,489
supplement for a strategy that’s focused
on food.

56
00:03:43,489 --> 00:03:48,099
But despite extremely high obesity rates in
the US, government agencies continue to present

57
00:03:48,099 --> 00:03:51,849
exercise as a solution
... as do companies with a real interest in

58
00:03:51,849 --> 00:03:54,599
making sure we keep eating and drinking their
products.

59
00:03:54,599 --> 00:03:59,660
Since the 1920s, companies like Coca-Cola
have been aligning themselves with the exercise

60
00:03:59,660 --> 00:04:03,360
message.
The idea here is that you can drink all these

61
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:08,400
extra bottles of soda as long as you work
out. But as we're seeing, it doesn't work like that.

62
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:13,920
Actually burning off those extra calories from a can of soda is really, really hard.

63
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,240
We have an obesity problem in this country, and we shouldn't

64
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:21,079
treat low physical activity  and eating too many calories as equally responsible for it.

65
00:04:21,079 --> 00:04:25,320
Public health policymakers should really prioritize improving our food environment

66
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:28,600
to help people make healthier choices about what they eat.

67
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:31,320
It's not impossible to lose weight through exercise,

68
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:35,560
it's just a lot harder. And we need to recognize how that works.

69
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:41,480
If you do go to the gym, and you burn all these calories, it takes you a long time to do so

70
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:42,760
and you put in a great amount of effort,

71
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:46,640
you can erase all of that in five minutes of eating a slice of pizza.

72
00:04:46,640 --> 00:00:00,000
Relative magnitude is actually quite surprising, and most people don't fully appreciate that.
