hello I'm Max Keiser this is the Kaiser reports you know the world is a finite place and yet humanity's capacity to generate garbage seems infinite oh my god how are those two gonna work how do you square that circle Stacy max well the circle is not being squared and in fact there's a finite amount of space even in the financial system where many think you can print an infinite number of dollars well China is saying Yankee go home to all American toxic waste whether it is actual trash trash garbage trash sort of stuff or trashy US Treasury bonds so they don't want any of them here's the first headline recycling chaos in US as China bans foreign waste and they set out to look at the classical virtue signaling sort of you know Portland Oregon couple and what it means to virtue signaling essentially it's gonna get a lot more expensive to signal your virtue like many Portland residents satish and arlene pal Shekhar are serious recyclers their house is coated with recycled bluish white paint they recycle their rainwater compost their food waste and carefully separate the paper and plastic they toss out but recently after loading up their Prius and driving to a sorting facility they got a shock quote the fellow said we don't take plastic anymore Satish says it should go in the trash so apparently China has said Busta from January 1st is the official date no more foreign waste will they accept you know all those container ships of plastics and cardboard and all sorts of stuff sent to China to recycle well they don't want any of it anymore yes well you know I remember the story about an entrepreneur in China this woman who noticed that all of these big cargo ship that were going to China return to China empty because of course America doesn't export anything to China they only import she said well send us your garbage send us your a corrugated cardboard for one thing and she recycled it and refabricated it in China and sold it back to the US essentially and she became a billionaire and there was a huge garbage trade flowing from America to China America's biggest export to China was garbage literally garbage huge tankers full of waste and now China is hit the maximum capacity for garbage and toxic sludge and air pollution and people are choking to death on the street and mercury poisoning is killing babies and what not so the government's like hey you know maybe we should take less garbage from America so they put the kibosh on this old garbage export business and now that as you point out these virtuous signalers in other words you know weasely types in Portlandia which is a great show by the way are unable to exercise their virtue by composting their own banana peels and by growing you know their own organic plants in the backyard and dividing plastic and whatnot in the recycling bin they have to now pay that's the bottom line they got the pay well actually part of the problem has been that they do not recycle they do not separate plastics so if in fact in our own community you'll see that the recycling section is just you dump it all plastic paper anything so people have been putting their stuffed animals wool sweaters all sorts of stuff in this thing but and and compressing it into a bale and then sending that bale via a container to China and then China has to separate them all out it's the fact that it's all blended together that's causing the toxic sort of environmental disaster there in China and so they'll go into the details you mentioned that the US exports all this garbage to China hmm and we're not just talking about the US Treasury bonds because they send a lot of that garbage and they send Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac sort of housing mortgage-backed securities and stuff like that but on the other end they send those at the higher end and on lower end they send all this stuff and the data is that the US exports about one third of its recycling and nearly half goes to China for decades China has used recyclables from around the world to supply its manufacturing boom but this summer it declared that this foreign waste includes too many other non recyclable materials that are dirty even hazardous and a filing with the World Trade Organization the country lists 24 kinds of solid wastes it would ban to protect China's environmental interests in people's health the complete ban takes place from January 1st but already some Chinese importers have not had their licenses renewed this is leaving us recycling companies scrambling to adapt so they look at a company called rogue Waste Systems and Southern Oregon which is you know they've received all this recycled stuff they package it and compress it into a bale in which they put it into a container and ship to China but as straiten is no longer willing to accept it there it's piling up while they look for somebody else around the world willing to accept it to actually do this job in the US it's too expensive to separate it all out and recycle appropriately so they're looking for somebody to send it to in the meantime local authorities are just telling them to send it to the you know the local dump so so these people a lot of people are feeling like they're doing well and I'm I Drive a Prius and I recycle but in fact they're recycling all that work they're doing to recycle is actually just going into the local landfill yeah I'll back up and I'll just be create a toxic environment you know ultimately corporations who packaged this stuff in plastics of course this would fall in the category of externality you know they don't pay for the environmental cost and and they will never be forced to pay for the environmental cost it's one of the subsidies that we assuming beings give to corporations we're willing to compromise our health by having to live in a garbage dump so that these corporations can continue to make on accounted for profits essentially and avoid this these problems but they're gated cities and and and and fortresses so they have a fortress this is the whole kind of process we've been covering over the past few years in Kies Report is the D globalization we've lived through very relatively easy times I think in 50 years time people will look back and say wow that period of time between like nineteen after the OPEC oil embargo from that period up until about now was just like everything all the prices were going down good through going down shipping everything around the world just-in-time delivery everything was all perfect and cheap and now I think the cost I think we've hit the bottom there and it looks like costs are starting to rise because as this roadway system says it's right now all this recycling is technically garbage but there are now international regulations about how much you have to recycle so recycling will have to happen and it's gonna cost more so therefore your products center cost more they one of the articles about this China story says that you know Amazon for example is gonna get hit really hard because they buy almost all of a lot of their packaging is provided by the recycled end product that has been until now created in China this the guy who runs rogue waste systems that I talked about Scott Fowler he talks about what Americans have been putting in their recycling bins that are technically not recyclable and has always just been put into these one-ton bales that get sent to China he points out a roll of linoleum gas cans a briefcase a surprising number of knitted sweaters plus there are frozen food cartons in plastic bags that many people think are recyclable but are not well you know these carbon nanotubes are incredibly strong and apparently you can create a geosynchronous satellite above planet Earth on a rope made of carbon nanotubes so you can get in outer space quite quickly like you just take an elevator five minutes up from there that staging platform you can containers and rockets and ferry the garbage to the moon which is our most you know close to satellite and the Dark Side of the Moon is also geosynchronous to Planet Earth you don't see the Dark Side of the Moon and turn that into an incredible garbage dump and just to get you know Elon Musk or one of these other guys to work this all out or Richard Branson Sir Richard Branson and you create a garbage fairy on this new technology and just create the Dark Side of the Moon dump I mean that's obviously the answer to this well a lot of people all sorts of not just Elon Musk a lot of people working on private satellites they should maybe they might invent a chute that just shoots garbage and dad a garbage cannon a garbage cannon and what that's a rail gun you know gun you can shoot a projectile into outer space on two nuclear powered rails essentially and you could just shoot garbage satellites into outer space that would be cool it's already cluttered with various broken satellite parts what nobody would know the difference if you've got like old diapers and stuff floating around in outer space blanketing planet Earth well of course Stephen Hawking is right that one day aliens will come visit us and we should try to avoid them ever coming to visit us but if they keep all our trash keeps on showing up on their planet it might encourage them to come look for us and who the hell is sending us all of these old diapers that's our mark of who we are you know the radio signals from Planet Earth that are still being emitted into outer space are the television signals that were first broadcast in the 1940s and of course those were Adolphe Hitler's speeches that were televised and those waves are the first waves to leave planet Earth and to travel into outer space so aliens if they do intercept rays or you know signals from Planet Earth from the 1940s their first introduction to humanity will be a tough Hitler and that'll be their first impression you know you can't you can't you can never make a first impression twice is that something like that yes so right now by definition they say that material out there is garbage referring to the stack of all these recyclables it has no value there is no demand for it in the marketplace it's garbage and in China itself because they're not accepting any of this stuff there is also a prob a lot of old ladies go around collecting all this sort of garbage and separating it and they have no market now finally on this last headline year this is a tweet that came out I think it was via Bloomberg and speaking of garbage and China no longer willing to accept it and what that might mean for a virtue signal because a lot of our US military is you know the support via the media is because we're such great virtuous people we're going to save those women of Afghanistan we're going to save those people of Benghazi we're going to save those people and you know various oil-rich nations around the world we're going to help them right well China's appetite for Treasuries may be about to ab just as america needs as biggest foreign creditor to help finance a growing budget deficit of course the budget deficit is not helped by the expanding military budget which is totally financed by China and if they are no longer have the appetite for Treasuries you know this is the thing that we've been looking at for years of course a lot of our guests are always like whenever they stop buying up Treasuries is it going to go all horribly right right so it's amazing that these two things are at CoCo you know incidental that they're not taking the garbage of the american fiat money either you know you could send them truckloads worth of dollars in hundred-dollar bills and they would say no we don't take that garbage anymore and of course that means that the ability to neutralize the effect of all that money printing disappears so that would come back into the economy in the form of inflation so we're starting to see some early warnings of inflation on the margins you know the ability to hide that are is disappearing rapidly okay well we got to rapidly exit to the second half yeah we take a break you know take a break and come back for the second half hey yeah why not well welcome back to the cow's report I'm Max Keiser time to return to our conversation with Marshall are back he is a research associate at the levy Institute all-around nice guy ex hockey player Marshall welcome back not a good hockey player I know you got to the junior high school level up basically that's right you ever seen that video on YouTube birth of a Canadian it's a you see ice there's a hole in the ice and then a man emerges oh yes I have seen that yeah you sticking a puck well that's true that's so we are that's how you were born that's how I was born down incredible yeah and may you can see that on YouTube alright let's talk about let's move on to some other topics of concern your thoughts on the crypto economy will this take down the economic system as we've known it what do you thought we have crypto crypto economy look in if you look at the history of money anybody can create an IOU or conduct a commercial transaction with another person provided both parties are willing to accept payment in the same medium of exchange so in that sense Bitcoin or whatever other cryptocurrency you want is fine if that's how they want to settle it but if you really want to insure a crypto currencies long-term viability then the easiest way to do that is by allowing you to extinguish your tax liabilities by using bitcoins if the government was ever able to do that then you know that would confer a huge immediate and additional demand on the currency right now because you would grab those bitcoins because you would actually be able to extinguish your tax liabilities so with the government now my guess is that the US government or for that matter any other sovereign government is not gonna be keen to lose its monopoly issue of the currency and so they won't allow that but that if you really wanted to have a viable alternative currency that would be the best way to do that if the government decided tomorrow that for example you can pay your texts and beaver pelts you'd probably get a revival and demand for beaver pelts well the government is clearly not on board with the idea of having citizens create their own currency yeah the government likes to be able to control that and so the question is really I don't know if you've well the government is constitutionally mandated to handle that role that was a role that was given to them so it's not it it's if it's a bit it's a dictatorship or a monopolist role it was conferred on them by the the the fathers of Independence yes and this ability now of individuals to create their own sovereignty by creating their own currency and my question is you know you're a smart guy no it's at leading Institute you guys sit around and talk about the big issues all day long I mean you know is this a threat to banks in other words banks there they're nervous they're nervous about this because it's threatens their monopoly yeah how do you see that well I have to admit I look I'm in the camp that says it's it's it's probably a bubble I know you with your Bitcoin button or I have a different view that's I must admit that when I hear Jamie Dimon you know go on against it III it does make me much more sympathetic to the whole is a Bitcoin I can certainly understand you know we've talked before about the law the massive political dysfunction because you're a rebel you know you don't like Jamie Dimon no I don't you you're our sign of the crypto sovereign movement I can understand the the objectives behind it I certainly feel that they have a legitimate beef against the assist in which they feel is it's stitched up against them and so I think that they stay from I I can certainly understand why this thing has developed the political context for which is to which is developed I'm just trying to say that if you really want it to be on sound footing that's the way you would have to do it and you'd have to have some cooperation when the government to to do it that way well I mean in the meantime if people the community feels that it'll drain there's so much capital away from banks central banks and government that they're they'll have an alternative well you know look I mean if you can point to MIT one historical example of this Leo libertarian fantasy that you know it's actually existed somewhere then you know that's great but I mean William Golding I think wrote about this in Lord of the Flies so it's that's afraid to stop and take on Bitcoin martial law but I'm moving on all right the Republicans are pushing through tax reform many who watch MSNBC may not know there are actually any domestic matters unrelated to the russia's President Putin scandal hoax your thoughts on what you see okay tax reform what's going on there well it's pretty regressive man meaning that it confers a lot more benefits to the top one percent and does the the middle class of the working class there's a whole lot of goodies in it for corporations as well you know this talk about you know we've got the one of the highest corporate tax rates in the world thirty five percent that that's that's bogus with all with all the exemptions that are already written into the code the the effective tax rate for most large corporations is is more like fifteen so I've seen some estimates as low as twelve General Electric I think they filed a seven thousand page tax return and they got a tax rebate yeah and that's right and they and then you've got companies like Apple that you know domicile a lot of their facilities in places like Jersey tax havens like like Jersey and the Channel Islands so so it's to mitigate their their tax bill so they're there are it's it's an unnecessary giveaway in a lot of respects there isn't that much done for personal income tax holders the and and look my my big and that's really the grounds in which I think you should object to this bill is that it's highly regressive and also it will probably do very very little for employment growth and for rising you know creating income growth which should be the goal behind it and in that regard I think that those are the grounds for objecting to it of course the Democrats are being very foolish because they keep on saying well it's going to add to the deficit and and that's absolutely awful but of course the minute you start taking that argument you are effectively seating the the your ear effectively embracing the paradigm the Republicans use because the next stage of that is going to be then in a few years time if the deficits do in fact grow as a result of this tax reform then they're the the the Republicans like Paul Ryan I'm gonna say you see we've got to get hold of entitlements done because the deficits are way too large and they're gonna attack Social Security and Medicare and then they'll turn to the Democrats and say and you see you guys basically Express so consent so much concerned about the deficit earlier so let's do something about it so it's a trap and the Democrats like Nancy Pelosi for example or fall right into it okay just a quick diversion a digression it's back to mmt modern monetary theory we talked a little bit about it you said you know you guys look don't look at interest rates as the way to two matters you kind of be more on the tax side the fiscal side yeah we're talking to talking about taxes now yeah so in your view what would be more of an ideal tax structure that's a political judgment but what do you think would be like sweet spot for how taxes are levied across the economic well like you're you're asking me to make an a priori judgment I would say that you can't really what's the what so what's wrong with the current tax regime this is my own personal opinion it that I think you'll find that MN tears have as many different uses there are varieties of ketchup so my own feeling is that the current tax code is too complex it is a it has become a political plaything for lobbyists do you support a flat tax I am in general in favor and generally in favor of Tax Simplification I probably go for some elements of progressivity to help emitting right to two or three basic levels all the loopholes yeah that would be mine totally yeah why don't we do that because all the lobbyists who Lobby that's right the corporate because the the real welfare queens that we have to worry about it well you're you're the real welfare queens or corporations yeah corporate and they write love their corporate welfare they that's socialism for the rich and capitalism for the rest of us yeah yeah that's right we take the risk yeah they take the gains yeah that's right and they get the bailouts when times get tough so you're right through the primary lever of interest rates at the central bank but I don't want to go there let's move on what else do I have on my goodies oh the 2018 midterms are coming up do you see any economic ideas coming from any of these Democrats well Bernie Sanders has a few that's largely because he's got a great economist working for him stephanie kelton who's with the Bernie King she still is affiliated with him still advises them so that they're there he's probably one and I'm sure there are others out there but yeah the the the better deal that they introduced it didn't have much I was new to it there were some interesting aspects of talking about concentrations of monopolies and then many names we're not familiar with like remember Barrack Obama came out of nowhere you know Donald Trump was kind of like who are this guys no no unfortunately not uh you know the the ones that keep getting named him are unfortunately being in a lot of them get ensnared and other kinds of scandals but no I that that's a real problem with the Democrats say they don't have a lot of bench strength I mean that their their leadership he's basically always seemed to me that the Democratic Party relies on charisma or as the Republicans have policies that they just keep hammering consistently they don't they don't change much whereas the Democrats you have like a Bill Clinton or a JFK you know who are very charismatic or Barack Obama I would say Ronald Reagan was very charismatic even if you you know you didn't agree with its politics but no I love what I what I would say the fundamental difference is that the the the the Democrats got out of the out of their way to insulting and and ignore their their bases aspirations whereas the Republicans at least in in in inward lips are yeah and they also aren't afraid to introduce crazy quote-unquote crazy ideas because that what what what what happened for example under Bush and Cheney is that they they would you know introduce an idea in people say you can't do that that's against was the crazy idea but you repeat it long enough and eventually you change the political landscape where it's the Democrats are always trying to be reasonable and in the context of being reasonable they never will introduce new ideas and they they will stick with the existing paradigms and that's why they keep losing elections I think that's very insightful and something lesson perhaps that these guys and the Democratic Party should embrace and they do need new leadership and me as I said you know you look the three leading Democrats in the House are all in their late 70s all the people that are being talked about it's 20 20 presidential candidates Sanders Warren and Biden they're all in their it mid to late 70s you know you've got a few young names like Kamala Harris being talked about but again not much is known about her background and and and that there isn't enough that there's really not enough new bench drink there's a few interesting people at the state there's an influx of women across the spectrum across America in the wake of these sex scandals so women are getting more political is that a trend that you're aware of and do you see that having an impact in 2018 and 2020 yeah it seems to have had an impact in the last set of elections we had the the special elections in the elections we had in Virginia absolutely my view cover that at the levy Institute I don't know they've got sperm they've got artificial insemination they don't need us anymore Marshall we're relics from a previous era they're setting us up for the big extermination everyone's a sex predator they don't they're just gonna throw us off a cliff and it's just gonna be a world run by women that's his view not mine and for the record look what I what I will say is oh yeah me too I think we've do least men have spent enough time screwing up the world let women have eternity yeah sure it's all intellectual property now you don't need muscles well you know I remember was being at a conference and I heard christine lagarde head of the IMF and she said that she thought the economic environment post 2008 might have been a bit different if we'd had lehman sisters rather than lehman brothers all right Marshall we'll have to leave it there thanks for being on the Kaiser report thanks for having me again I think all right well that's gonna do it for this edition of the Kaiser report with me max guys are it Stacy I would like thank I guess Marshall are back from the levee Institute it's gonna reach us on twitter it's Kaiser report until next time bye Oh
