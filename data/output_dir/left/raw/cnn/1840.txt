1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,520
hurricane Irma has just moments ago but
upgraded to a major storm a category 4

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:09,990
hurricane the Florida appearing to be
right in its track authorities there are

3
00:00:09,990 --> 00:00:14,099
sounding the alarm warning residents to
stock up and get their emergency plans

4
00:00:14,099 --> 00:00:17,910
in order right now I'm gonna go straight
to meteorologist Tom Sater Tom the

5
00:00:17,910 --> 00:00:21,840
various models are starting to agree
here that the continental US is in the

6
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:26,910
Hurricanes path when my term a hit well
you know let me back up to Thursday when

7
00:00:26,910 --> 00:00:29,820
we first introduced armed up we said
that we're really going to need about

8
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:33,540
four or five days and that's starting to
unfold as you mentioned the models are

9
00:00:33,540 --> 00:00:37,230
getting a new agreement but when we
showed you a model last Thursday the

10
00:00:37,230 --> 00:00:41,610
European model and the US model were
twelve hundred miles apart the US model

11
00:00:41,610 --> 00:00:44,969
up by the northeastern US and the
European down by Florida well now

12
00:00:44,969 --> 00:00:48,780
they're pretty close and I'll show you
this system right now is just as strong

13
00:00:48,780 --> 00:00:53,520
as Harvey was when it made landfall in
devastated Rockport Texas the winds are

14
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:57,180
the same at 130 and it's moving right
over the northern islands of the Lesser

15
00:00:57,180 --> 00:01:02,879
Antilles that's st. Kitts and Nevis
that's Antigua Barbuda Anguilla in fact

16
00:01:02,879 --> 00:01:06,060
might move right over that then it's the
u.s. British Virgin Islands that have a

17
00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:10,320
watch that will go to a warning as well
as Puerto Rico six to nine foot storm

18
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:12,869
surges 10 inches of rain most of the
heavy rain I think it's going to stay

19
00:01:12,869 --> 00:01:16,439
over water but here's it just a little
time plan with tropical storm force

20
00:01:16,439 --> 00:01:21,540
winds Tuesday Wednesday Thursday Turks
and Caicos Dominican Republic Haiti then

21
00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:25,409
Cuba and possibly even extending into
southern Florida but let's run the

22
00:01:25,409 --> 00:01:29,100
National Hurricane Center track and
you'll get an idea it hasn't really

23
00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:33,210
moved much it's been trending south and
if you look at this you think well my

24
00:01:33,210 --> 00:01:36,390
goodness this is heading right into the
Gulf of Mexico we can't rule that out

25
00:01:36,390 --> 00:01:40,350
but I don't think that's the best case
scenario right now we have still a

26
00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:45,240
window open although it's closing but we
have a window open that we could see the

27
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:49,500
system turn to the north and stay out in
the Atlantic off the coast but that

28
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:53,340
window is shutting quickly most likely
what we're looking at Pamela's we get in

29
00:01:53,340 --> 00:01:56,820
toward Friday we're looking at a turn to
the right we don't know when that will

30
00:01:56,820 --> 00:01:59,640
happen
so we can't give you exact location of a

31
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:04,920
landfall or the timing just yet but let
me show you the European now with the US

32
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:09,030
model and as we put these in comparison
now first of all they're on top of each

33
00:02:09,030 --> 00:02:13,200
other so we start out the same location
you want to see agreement they're not

34
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:16,440
moving from me
each other but was we get closer out or

35
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:21,390
farther out I should say there is some
variation this is Sunday afternoon

36
00:02:21,390 --> 00:02:25,410
now last Thursday it was Saturday night
we had it here so it hasn't been moving

37
00:02:25,410 --> 00:02:29,040
much let's take it now to 911 and it
does look like if it doesn't make

38
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:32,430
landfall in Florida somewhere in the
coastal Carolina's so everyone needs to

39
00:02:32,430 --> 00:02:36,060
start preparing have a plan sit down
with the family and discuss this next

40
00:02:36,060 --> 00:02:40,590
weekend maybe a major hurricane at least
category three four could be five of

41
00:02:40,590 --> 00:02:44,580
course all this on the heels of
hurricane Harvey Tom Sater thank you

42
00:02:44,580 --> 00:00:00,000
very much
