good morning and welcome to am joy live from Washington DC this week as a federal judge ordered the Trump administration to reunite thousands of migrant children separated from their parents by the Department of Homeland Security protests have erupted around the country all leading up to today expected to be the largest day of protests thus far in this crisis of the administration's making today thousands of Americans in more than 600 cities will take to the streets the goal of today's families belong together marches is to demand an end to Trump's zero-tolerance immigration policy to call for migrant families to be reunited immediately and to send a message to Donald Trump the detention of migrant families should be taken off the table but even facing the added pressure of a court imposed 30-day deadline to reunite families with no clear plan it's unclear how exactly the Trump administration will comply time may not be on their side meanwhile the administration says that as of Tuesday 2047 separated children are still in government custody only six fewer than last week joining me now is MSNBC's garret Hutt Garrett Haake who is on the ground here in DC where a huge rally is set to begin in an hour just to warn everyone there's a little bit of a delay between myself and Garrett so Garrett I'll just start by asking you what are you expecting to see today have you started to speak to the folks who are trickling in to begin participating in the rally hey joy good morning well we're about 200 yards from the White House and while the president isn't here today it's gonna be hard for him to ignore these pictures we expect to see a massive rally here in DC organizers say they could get as many as 50,000 people here in the streets around the White House marching through downtown DC on this issue now there are bold-faced names involved in this particular protest today not the mother you might see in some of these others across the country but we expect to see lin-manuel Miranda here Alicia Keys are expected to participate but I think what's going to draw a lot of attention here today are hearing from some of these immigrant families in some cases even through translators it'll really be the first time I think that the nation has gotten to see these families on such a big stage and the folks who have started to gather here and we're still more than an hour from this really getting under way are fired up about this issue and have been for weeks and I think that's really important you know there was that protest on Thursday and the Hart Senate office building that had had not been for the shooting in Annapolis I think could have been one of the biggest stories of this week you saw 500 people get arrested including at least one member of Congress it speaks to just how fired up people continue to be about this issue and frankly I think how little faith they have that the court injunctions the executive orders and the steps that have been taken politically so far will be enough these people want to see a lot more get done here at joy Garrett Haake thank you very much we are going to come back to you periodically to check in with you to see what you're seeing out there on the ground here in Washington DC thank you very much appreciate it and joining me now here in the studio Maria Tracey Kumar president and CEO of voto Latino community on Pierre senior advisor at moveon.org an MSNBC correspondent Mariana Atencio who's joining us from LA thank you all for being here I'm gonna start here at the table and Marisa Kumar we know what the demands are to end the family detentions to end the zero-tolerance immigration policy to reunite the families how disturbing is it for you to learn that the administration has so far managed to read not exactly six out of 2,000 and more than 2,000 and 50,000 right well I think that it was they did the photo-op and then they figure that after they did the photo-op of the six children and the six family reunifications they wouldn't have to do it again and let's be clear we're trying industry organizations have all come together trying to figure out how can they actually find a database how to convey create reaiiy denta fication the government can do that tomorrow if we demand the trey gowdy come together with elijah coming and demand a hearing oversight hearing for Nielsen sessions scott lloyd basically saying where are the children where unifications all of this is done through government contracts there are government there are government databases that have both the parents and the children but we're not asking them to actually come over and do an oversight hearing that Congress has to be responsible to the American public and we're not demanding that they do their job in Korean you've had 18 states sue the Trump administration over these family separation policies because even the states are not able to get information about migrants who are in their state who are in the custody of HHS NPR says a federal judge has told them that you have to reunite the families public counsel obtained refugees and asylum-seekers have been forcibly separated forcibly separated have filed lawsuits to try to get their children back so you have all of this legal maneuver and taking place but you there's no evidence that I've seen there's that the administration has a plan to reunite there's no there was never a plan that's the point the point was to do this horrible inhumane act and not care about reunifying them ever and here's the thing there's a report that came out I believe yesterday that there could be more than 2,000 rounds kids that have been separated from their parents apparently they were doing this as a pilot program the government was doing this as a pilot program in Texas months prior to that with no when it became official so they were doing it I think from October to February so there could be 4,100 is the what I were in the report that could be separated and they have to and from the court Kate from the courts they have to reunify them by July 26 right how can they possibly do that if there is no plan we haven't heard of any of the planets and we don't know we don't know where the kids are we don't know where the babies are we don't know where the girls are we have no idea of what's going on enjoy something that most Americans don't realize is that after a certain time that is the child is with the myth with the government then they get trapped into foster care once they are tracked into foster care the parent by legal right loses the right to their child right they lose cut they lose their own just like any other pretend many of the parents have been deporting already and they've already some of them pleading guilty I want to go to money on intensity on that because some of the parents have also already pleaded guilty to unlawful entry meaning now when they're petitioning to get the custody of the child on their record is having pleaded guilty to a crime and then you have some parents I know you've talked to a lot of parents who were separated from their children do you get the sense that the parents believe that the government even knows where their children are it's devastating joy and I think the outrage for many of the parents I have spoken to is that they do believe the government has the information they're just roll octant to give it out meanwhile you have these immigrants who have been released from these detention centers who don't speak English don't have any of their belongings they're they're trying to get somewhere and some help to be able to be reunified with their children I spoke to Maria for example she's an immigrant from El Salvador who came here with the migrant caravan meaning she turned herself legally at a port of entry seeking asylum she was kept at the otay Meza detention center for weeks her little boy Marcus is seven she has a two-year-old named Nelson she knows they're somewhere in New York she has just been released it's trying to make her way to them but she says the government told her that she has to provide DNA proof that she's the mother more documents things that were actually taken from her in detention so just hearing from this mother is absolutely dead stating and an example of what these families are going through I spoke to a lawyer in Brownsville who's representing a man from Guatemala trying to get reunify with his twelve-year-old daughter and she told me that she calls the caseworker and she knows that they have the information for both because the parents information is on a DHS track the kids information is on an OL RR track but they're just reluctant to give it out so it's it's really just prove that there seems to be no plan no consistency and no relief for these families the people from the Texas Civil Rights Project told me that they represent almost 400 families and they've only been able to confirm for reunifications and in fact five people who already been deported without their children and there's no relief for them in that injunction oh my goodness yeah so not only do you have the parents who as you know to put their money on a maid they're attracted to a Department of Homeland Security system right right the children are tracked through the office of refugee resettlement subtracting two different directions right into two different agencies and that is that it's a challenge that HHS their involvement has to be in safety of the child so then they are going and investigating the parent who or if there is a custodial or an aunt or somewhere they're saying give us your fingerprints right right tell us your papers so they're also putting people in jeopardy of themselves exactly right tracking for G well exactly right and that with what the problem is that we're not gonna give straight answer from any of the heads of this government agencies because not only do they not have a plan they seem clearly not don't seem to care so when the American people again not to drive home the point when the American people say that they want to help the best way they can help is to call the members of Congress and demand an oversight hearing this is outrageous we have to make sure that these children basically not only reunified but let's forget a lot of these children getting separate from their parents over misdemeanor charge yep right it's a misdemeanor to press in order to cross the border the first can we play this vais audio please for my producers in because just to bring this back home because you talked about it and it's it's theoretical and it's horrifying to think about but when you hear the voices of these distraught children it's hard to listen to but I feel like we need to run it this is a little girl about little boy sorry little boy who's talking to his mom is mom is from Guatemala and he has been separated from one another and this is a vice news record an audio of their phone call take a listen to a performance our veena in okay well Beaubien well very well Travis no tengo miedo de la posada e yeah it's a long-ass effect without the mucho you know your respite on Saturdays I envy and I'm sitting here on the set with two mothers of very young children you know my children you know at this point but even for me I just take myself right back to them as that little boy and it's and so I have to play to juxtapose that just for artists just so you understand what we're dealing but in terms of the mentality yeah of the people we're dealing with this is the the paternity general the United States jeff Sessions well I wonder if he's mood when he hears that audio when I hear this audio of him the rhetoric we hear from the other side on this issue as on many others has become radicalized these same people live in gated communities many of them and if you try to scale the fence believe me they'll be even too happy to have you arrested and separated from your children if that would like to see that well so they want borders in their lives but not in yours Korean yeah you know I live in Florida my kids and I lived as geta community whenever a little so they come and take in one of them I don't I don't even understand that I'm sorry I don't well I mean we've talked about this joy which is the dehumanization of a group of people and we've seen this in the past and this is what's happening when you do that and you hear the way he's speaking sessions is speaking you feel like you can do anything two groups of people you could treat them like animals as the president has called the teas call them infestations so it is it is really sad because it is a it is a way of taking people's rights when you were playing the Vice tape there the video it made me think about earlier in the week there was a young boy who was separated from his family taken to New York and he tried to jump of a two-story building because he was so devastated and heartbroken and so there's a there's also two part to what's happening today yes it's demanding that we bring these families back together but there's also part of if they are brought back together what do this administration wants to do they want to detain them permanently which we cannot have and either right and so during the Obama administration we had similar problems of families facing the refugee crisis and what they did is they put ankle bracelets and they reached least them you know and then they'd have to come back and check in it worked it worked it was a program that was basically had 90% efficacy people come in and show up and then they would be able to resolve whether the person was here seeking asylum you know where they had to be deported what we were doing right now is not only inhumane it is costing billions of dollars in the taxpayers and now they're gonna build detention camps to put these families in what the administration wants is definite tension last word to you on this Mariana Atencio because now you have a trump administration plan that they say is gonna fix this by essentially saying that anyone who enters the country illegally would be barred from getting asylum no matter what they were fleeing gang violence war it doesn't matter what they were seeing but what they're fleeing if they are convicted of illegal entry they would be prevented they'd be prosecuted and would immediately be denied Asylum period your thoughts they're not making it easy for these families to do this the right way joy we have been reporting for the past week in Arizona in that border they are keeping dozens and dozens of families with little babies out in the blazing hot Sun waiting for an average of two weeks in Mexico trying to seek asylum the right way what do you think a mother who is 21 years old who has been harassed and beaten and raped by some of the same smugglers that are bringing her over and is carrying a young child what do you think that she will be tempted or told to do after she's been waiting on the other side for two weeks to come in through a port of entry or just to try to come in any way she can because she's so desperate they're not making it easy for these families and now that will mean that they will automatically get prosecuted so when the messaging coming from this administration you had Mike Pence and Nielson in Guatemala this week saying you want to come to the United States do it legally or don't come at all they're making it nearly impossible for these people to come here legally and if they don't do it they'll get prosecuted yeah and last word last question very quick I know we're out of time Mariana just from your reporting is the administration indeed have they stopped separating families I have not heard of any recent separations after the executive order but what I do keep hearing is of people being detained being stuck at ports of entry what I do keep hearing is of people who try to seek asylum legally being placed with ankle monitors being separated for short periods of time from their firm their children inside the tension which is a form of dehumanization which is a form of criminalizing these people who have an international right to seek asylum and just as your round table was discussing when they talk about an infestation when they talk about these hoards that are coming it dehumanizes all of us the the legal immigrants like myself who are here and the undocumented immigrants and the ones who are coming with every right to seek asylum the right way and seek a better life for their children joy Thank You Mariana Atencio thank you for reporting Maria Teresa and Corrine oh and Mariana will be back with us later and stay right here up ahead the government still has no idea how they're going to reunite all of these thousands of migrant children with their parents so they took the crumb and things are about to get worse worse
