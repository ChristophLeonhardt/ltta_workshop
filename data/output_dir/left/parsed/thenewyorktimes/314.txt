"Since I was little girl, I was
watching Bode Miller compete
and winning in every discipline."
Out of the gate.
"That’s what it means to
be the best in the world.
Not just winning slaloms or one
event, but being able to win,
to really compete
in every event."
"You have slalom skiers that
are specializing in slalom.
And to be competitive with them,
you need a lot of training.
Then GS, the same thing.
There’s a lot of GS specialists.
And then downhill
and super-G, that’s
a whole other set of girls
that are obviously exceptional.
Racing all five
disciplines, there’s
very few people that have
actually been able to do it."
"When I ski, I feel some kind of
a rhythm with every course.
Slalom is much faster
tempo between turns.
So it’s kind of like a
really upbeat sort of a song,
like today’s hits, you know."
"And then oddly
enough, downhill, it’s
almost like some sort
of classical symphony.
So that’s been an
interesting transition."
"When I was doing only
giant slalom and slalom,
I barely had enough time
for training as it was.
Now, adding two more events,
I have basically twice
as much training
that I need to do
and half the amount
of time to do it all."
"Skiing down an icy mountain
at 80 miles an hour.
If you catch an edge,
before you even can blink,
you’re in the fences,
on the side of the hill.
And normally crashing that fast,
you’re going to get injured".
"130 kilometers an hour."
"My biggest dream in ski racing
when I was five years old
was that I wanted to
win the overall title.
So it’s just me staying true
to my dream as a little girl."
