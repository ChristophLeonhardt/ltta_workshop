24
00:01:11,310 --> 00:01:13,290
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> hopefully it won't be much shorter</font>

25
00:01:13,290 --> 00:01:17,070
than<font color="#CCCCCC"> it is right now I don't know you</font>

26
00:01:17,070 --> 00:01:18,450
just get so scared like<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> don't want to</font>

27
00:01:18,450 --> 00:01:22,049
cut but now for the health of my hair I

28
00:01:22,049 --> 00:01:25,650
need<font color="#CCCCCC"> a cut so I'm going to do the method</font>

29
00:01:25,650 --> 00:01:27,240
<font color="#CCCCCC">that he talks about in his tutorial</font>

30
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:31,650
which is you take it from the temple and

31
00:01:31,650 --> 00:01:36,720
cut out a straight angle and then you

32
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:39,960
take<font color="#CCCCCC"> it from the center at a 90 degree</font>

33
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:41,810
angle and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then you take it from the top</font>

34
00:01:41,810 --> 00:01:45,180
straight up and so I'm going to try that

35
00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:48,689
method to cut my hair anyway see I'm

36
00:01:48,689 --> 00:01:50,570
gonna do that and I'm come back and

37
00:01:50,570 --> 00:01:53,490
hopefully my hair won't look too much

38
00:01:53,490 --> 00:01:56,189
shorter because I don't want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> cuz I</font>

39
00:01:56,189 --> 00:02:01,700
like my<font color="#E5E5E5"> weight yeah be back in a sec</font>

40
00:02:03,250 --> 00:02:10,090
alright so this is Coast trim do you

41
00:02:10,090 --> 00:02:11,440
like you got strike a pose when you do

42
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:17,410
it I'm pretty happy when I was trimming

43
00:02:17,410 --> 00:02:20,890
I realized like so the ends you could

44
00:02:20,890 --> 00:02:22,570
just see that they were breaking and so

45
00:02:22,570 --> 00:02:23,740
it's just kind of like you know what

46
00:02:23,740 --> 00:02:29,320
just trying to do it how did it dude you

47
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:33,790
missed the haircut I couldn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> wait good</font>

48
00:02:33,790 --> 00:02:38,050
and wait I had to do it dude class got

49
00:02:38,050 --> 00:02:41,170
canceled or I forgot that class wasn't

50
00:02:41,170 --> 00:02:45,160
happening so I can still feel<font color="#CCCCCC"> that some</font>

51
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:47,170
of them I didn't quite get to where the

52
00:02:47,170 --> 00:02:52,209
breakages but that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay by this time</font>

53
00:02:52,209 --> 00:02:54,580
next year I will chop them off and we

54
00:02:54,580 --> 00:02:57,670
will start a new<font color="#E5E5E5"> way I'm pretty</font>

55
00:02:57,670 --> 00:03:06,459
contented it's all mixed with Caitlyn's

56
00:03:06,459 --> 00:03:10,060
here<font color="#CCCCCC"> Kaylee's here too you know it's</font>

57
00:03:10,060 --> 00:03:12,400
<font color="#CCCCCC">just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like from you know common everyday</font>

58
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:16,150

59
00:03:16,150 --> 00:03:20,650
heap of hair that I cut you can see my

60
00:03:20,650 --> 00:03:23,640
roommates here is<font color="#E5E5E5"> also mixed in there</font>

61
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:29,860
yeah she's blonde so but uh trimmed it

62
00:03:29,860 --> 00:03:35,519
all it was a nice good chunk of hair

63
00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:38,739
gone but and I can feel that it's

64
00:03:38,739 --> 00:03:41,470
shorter but it needed to be<font color="#CCCCCC"> done and I'm</font>

65
00:03:41,470 --> 00:03:45,880
happy with<font color="#CCCCCC"> it so once again thank you</font>

66
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:48,130
YouTube before providing me with the

67
00:03:48,130 --> 00:03:51,250
means to know how to cut my hair<font color="#E5E5E5"> and use</font>

68
00:03:51,250 --> 00:03:56,760
the back now the back is a lot shorter

69
00:03:56,760 --> 00:03:59,709
then took a lot off though I took a lot

70
00:03:59,709 --> 00:04:00,640
off the back<font color="#E5E5E5"> because that's where most</font>

71
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:04,390
of the breakage was so but I'm pretty

72
00:04:04,390 --> 00:04:06,280
okay with it I'm hoping<font color="#E5E5E5"> that they don't</font>

73
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:07,780
end<font color="#E5E5E5"> up starting to unravel there was</font>

74

nothing else<font color="#CCCCCC"> little scared about but</font>

75
00:04:09,010 --> 00:04:11,970
where I cut I made sure I cut where I

76
00:04:11,970 --> 00:04:13,989
can feel that they were strong in that

77
00:04:13,989 --> 00:04:15,270
place so

78
00:04:15,270 --> 00:04:18,060
and I'll make<font color="#CCCCCC"> sure I moisturize tonight</font>
