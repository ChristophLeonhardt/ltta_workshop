so yeah it's true these steel tears will increase the prices of things in America made with steel by a few percent but it will create an industry and lots of jobs it's a trade off just like the illegal Mexican immigrants picking fruit and vegetables in California they make fruit and vegetables a few pennies cheaper it is true Trump is not a Milton Friedman free enterprise or he's not a think tank purist he is a guy who has built things and worked with things and if that Steel Workers AD was right he did use foreign cheap steel before of course he did sus stupid it was the rules of the game and he wasn't gonna disadvantage himself over his competitors but now that he can change the rules of the game he says he's going to do it to save American industry the fact that will also help him win Ohio and Pennsylvania in Michigan and Indiana again next time well sure that's politics but what about he asked here in Canada what about Canadians the New York Times specifically says the White House does not want any exemptions for Canada I'll read the first sentence China is the main target of possible tough new United States trade measures against low priced imports of steel and aluminum but the sanctions threatened to ensnare America's closest allies particularly Canada unquote and Trump hinted at that in this comment he made a few days ago he said Canadians were smooth but I don't think he meant it as a compliment what do you think we lose a lot with Canada people don't know it Canada's very smooth they have you believe that it's wonderful and it is for them not wonderful for us it's wonderful for them so we have to start showing that we know what we're doing I don't know if you saw it on the screen it was little but the date on that New York Times article was actually a week ago when Trudeau was dancing his way through India in his own Bollywood costume party and of course getting himself embroiled in a terrorism issue my point is this steel tariff issue it's not a surprise it didn't just happen yesterday Trump has been talking about it for 30 years as I showed you he served us known as months ago that he wants to scrap after he's been talking about Canada in particular for months but Trudeau was oblivious to all this is this boring to him Trudeau is actually avoiding Trump which is weird both men attended the World Economic Forum in Davos Switzerland together Trudeau was there for nearly a week partying with the Stars showing off his fancy socks talking about feminism but he rushed home ranked before Trump arrived why would he do that why not meet the man that's an excerpt from my daily TV show the Ezra Levant show normally it's behind a paywall but I thought you'd like this video so we put it on YouTube if you want to subscribe to watch the daily show every day including always two interviews today and I read my hate mail just click on this screen and become a Premium Member you
