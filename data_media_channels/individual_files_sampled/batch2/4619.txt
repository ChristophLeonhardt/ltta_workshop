and Hans on a second issue the president announced there wasn't announced from the White House that the president is freezing pay for federal employees through 2019 could you give us some context on that well so the president talked about this this was in the President's budget there's a 1.9 pay increase that the Senate voted for for federal employees all across the DC region but also across the country he's freezing that and he's also freezing a locality bump and when you look at some of the high cost of living areas like New York like a Washington DC a lot of those families really factored in what their locality bump will be now what's unclear from the president's letter and we're trying to figure it out is whether he's entirely getting away with any of the cola adjustments or whether or not it is just the pay increases now there's a way for the Congress to jam the President on that and that is when they include their spending bills to include this 1.9 percent increase for 2019 if the president signs the bill that will become the law but right now the president seems to be picking a fight with federal employees denying them their annual pay increase and we'll see just how severe it is for those high cost of living areas hey there I'm Chris Hayes from MSNBC thanks for watching MSNBC on youtube if you want to keep up to date with the videos we're putting out you can click subscribe just below me or click over on this list to see lots of other great videos
