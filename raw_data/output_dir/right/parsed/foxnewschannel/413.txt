VOTE AND WE EXPECT THEM TO GET
ONE.
WITH THAT, I WILL TAKE YOUR
QUESTIONS.
>> THE THREE PEOPLE THAT ARE THE
MOST IMPORTANT IN THIS PROCESSOR
SENATOR MURKOWSKI, COLLINS, AND
FORD.
THIS MORNING, TO GO OF THEM WERE
UPSET ABOUT HOW THE PRESIDENT
DESCRIBED CHRISTINE MALLOZZI
FORD IN THAT RALLY IN
MISSISSIPPI.
KNOWING HOW SENSITIVE THIS IS,
THESE PEOPLE NEED TO BE
COMFORTABLE WITH VOTING FOR HIM.
WHY DID THE PRESIDENT SAY WHAT
HE DID IN THE WAY THAT HE SAID
IT?
>> Secretary Sanders: THE
PRESIDENT WAS STATING THE FACTS,
THE FACTS THAT WERE INCLUDED IN
RACHEL MITCHELL'S REPORT.
HE WAS STATING FACTS THAT WERE
GIVEN DURING DR. FORD'S
TESTIMONY AND THE SENATE HAS TO
MAKE A DECISION BASED ON THOSE
FACTS.
AND WHETHER OR NOT THEY SEE
JUDGE KAVANAUGH TO BE QUALIFIED

SUPREME COURT.
EVERY SINGLE WORD JUDGE
KAVANAUGH HAS SAID HAS BEEN
PICKED APART.
SECOND BY SECOND OF HIS
TESTIMONY HAS BEEN PICKED APART

BEEN THROWN AGAINST HIM, THAT IS
TOTALLY OFF LIMITS AND
OUTRAGEOUS.
THIS ENTIRE PROCESS HAS BEEN A
DISGRACE AND THE ONLY REASON
IT'S BEEN THAT WAY IS BECAUSE
SENATE DEMOCRATS DIDN'T DO THIS
THE WAY IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN DONE
AND THEY CIRCUMVENTED THE ENTIRE
SYSTEM AND UNDERMINED OUR ENTIRE
JUDICIAL BRANCH BY THE WAY
THEY'VE ACTED IN THE
INAPPROPRIATE WAY THEY'VE
CONDUCTED THEMSELVES.

THE TONE WITH WHICH THE PRESIDEN
THE TONE WITH WHICH THE PRESIDET
THE TONE WITH WHICH THE PRESIDEO
KEY SWING VOTES FOR HIS
NOMINATION.
AS THE PRESIDENT CONCERNED HE
MAY HAVE PUT THOSE VOTES IN
DANGER BY DOING WHAT HE DID LAST
NIGHT?
