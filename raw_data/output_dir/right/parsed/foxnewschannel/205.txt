>>> WELCOME BACK.
I'M HERE WITH JOHN RATCLIFF.
WE WERE ON THE HOMELAND SECURITY
COMMITTEE.
THEY ARE ISSUING A WARNING.
THE KINGDOM CONFIRMED REJECTION
OF ANY THREATS AND ATTEMPTS TO
UNDERMINED IT OR REPEATING FALSE
ACCUSATIONS.
>> MARIA, THIS WAS A HORRIBLE
ALLEGATION THE SAUDI GOVERNMENT
WAS INVOLVED IN THE SLAYING OR
ALLEGED SLAYING OF HIM.
IT'S STILL AN ALLEGATION.
I SUBSCRIBE TO THE THEORY OF
INNOCENT UNTIL PROVEN GUILTY.
UNLESS WE SEE THE EVIDENCE THE
AT
TURKISH GOVERNMENT SAYS THEY
HAVE WE SHOULD PROCEED IN THE
AREA.
I UNDERSTAND IF IT'S TRUE WE
NEED TO TAKE SOME PUNITIVE
ACTION AGAINST SAUDI ARABIA.
CUTTING OFF TIES OR ENDING ARMS
DEALS WITH AN ALLY IN THE MIDDLE
EAST CREATES A VACUUM FOR OUR
ADVOSAR -- ADVERSARY.
WE NEED TO MOVE CAREFULLY HERE.
I TRUST THAT PRESIDENT TRUMP AND
SECRETARY OF STATE AND
AMBASSADOR BOLTON WILL GET THE
INFORMATION TO EVALUATE THIS AND
DETERMINE WHAT SORT OF ACTION
SHOULD BE TAKEN.
