anything to book.

184
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:52,860
How come?

185
00:07:52,860 --> 00:07:55,460
I have every week booked
until May of 2019.

186
00:07:55,460 --> 00:07:57,392
[laughter]

187
00:07:57,392 --> 00:07:59,330
Super Mario,
wonderful seeing you.

188
00:07:59,330 --> 00:08:00,050
OK, Barbara, good
to see you again.

189
00:08:00,050 --> 00:08:01,091
See you tomorrow morning?

190
00:08:01,091 --> 00:08:01,790
Absolutely.

191
00:08:01,790 --> 00:08:02,900
Your coffee, your —

192
00:08:02,900 --> 00:08:04,370
Yeah, same thing.

193
00:08:04,370 --> 00:08:05,260
O.K., ciao.

194
00:08:05,260 --> 00:08:06,640
Ciao, ciao.

195
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:07,770
OK, Danny, I’ll leave you.

196
00:08:07,770 --> 00:08:08,140
See you around.

197
00:08:08,140 --> 00:08:09,030
I’ll leave you alone.

198
00:08:09,030 --> 00:08:09,620
Bye, Carly.

199
00:08:09,620 --> 00:08:10,160
Bye-bye.

200
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:10,660
See you.

201
00:08:13,742 --> 00:08:15,610
Super Mario, [spanish].

202
00:08:15,610 --> 00:08:17,140
[spanish]

203
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:32,960
At the beginning when I started
living on a cruise ship,

204
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:38,880
yeah, some points in time
I had maybe some regrets.

205
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:40,530
Why did I leave
everything behind?

206
00:08:43,580 --> 00:08:46,110
But then, that sort
of just went away.

207
00:08:49,670 --> 00:08:52,145
[orchestral music swells]

208
00:08:52,145 --> 00:08:53,505
[bubbles]

209
00:08:56,610 --> 00:08:59,220
I have already planned my death.

210
00:08:59,220 --> 00:09:02,940
If I really get
sick, I may decide

211
00:09:02,940 --> 00:09:09,670
to do one final scuba dive and
just go down 400 feet.

212
00:09:10,340 --> 00:09:16,158
Instead of having to live my last years
on land in a land hospital.

213
00:09:16,158 --> 00:09:18,828
To me, that would be pure hell.

214
00:09:42,730 --> 00:09:45,520
But you know, I am
not focused on that.

215
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:49,930
I think that’s still,
hopefully, a ways away,

216
00:09:49,930 --> 00:09:53,960
so I’m not worried about that.

217
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:56,960
[coughs]

218
00:09:56,960 --> 00:00:00,000
