THIS POINT.

189
00:05:40,437 --> 00:05:42,972
[INDISTINCT QUESTION]

190
00:05:42,973 --> 00:05:44,574
>> President Trump: I HAVE,

191
00:05:44,575 --> 00:05:45,208
AND THEY ARE ALL EITHER

192
00:05:45,209 --> 00:05:47,777
CONTACTED OR IN THE PROCESS --

193
00:05:47,778 --> 00:05:51,181
HAD A LONG TALK WITH RICK SCOTT,

194
00:05:51,182 --> 00:05:51,881
A GOVERNOR SCOTT OF FLORIDA.

195
00:05:51,882 --> 00:05:52,615
VERY WELL CORNERED WITH ALL OF

196
00:05:52,616 --> 00:05:55,552
THE STATES.

197
00:05:55,553 --> 00:05:56,553
ONE OF THE THINGS THAT MUST BE

198
00:05:56,554 --> 00:05:57,287
SAID IS IT'S NOT SO EASY FOR

199
00:05:57,288 --> 00:06:01,824
SOME OF THESE PEOPLE, SOME OF

200
00:06:01,825 --> 00:06:03,860
THE AREAS ARE VERY POOR.

201
00:06:03,861 --> 00:06:05,562
NOT EASY FOR A PERSON WITHOUT

202
00:06:05,563 --> 00:06:06,763
THE NECESSARY MONEY TO LEAVE.

203
00:06:06,764 --> 00:06:08,598
WHAT WE HAVE DONE IS WE HAVE

204
00:06:08,599 --> 00:06:09,365
SENT BUSES.

205
00:06:09,366 --> 00:06:10,200
WE HAVE SENT A LOT OF

206
00:06:10,201 --> 00:06:11,534
DIFFERENT -- WE ARE DOING A LOT

207
00:06:11,535 --> 00:06:13,002
OF DIFFERENT THINGS TO TRY AND

208
00:06:13,003 --> 00:06:14,837
REMOVE PEOPLE FROM THE AREA.

209
00:06:14,838 --> 00:06:16,406
A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE VERY POOR

210
00:06:16,407 --> 00:06:17,173
AND CERTAIN OF THOSE AREAS.

211
00:06:17,174 --> 00:06:19,008
IT IS VERY TOUGH FOR THEM TO

212
00:06:19,009 --> 00:06:19,375
LEAVE.

213
00:06:19,376 --> 00:06:20,510
THAT'S ONE OF THE PROBLEMS YOU

214
00:06:20,511 --> 00:06:22,378
ARE FINDING, I GUESS.

215
00:06:22,379 --> 00:06:26,716
>> YES, IN SOME CASES -- WHAT WE

216
00:06:26,717 --> 00:06:28,785
ASKED TO DO IS ASK PEOPLE WHO

217
00:06:28,786 --> 00:06:30,153
MAY NOT HAVE THE MEANS ARE THE

218
00:06:30,154 --> 00:06:32,555
MECHANISMS TO GET OUT OF TOWN TO

219
00:06:32,556 --> 00:06:33,423
REGISTER WITH THEIR LOCAL

220
00:06:33,424 --> 00:06:34,791
EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT AGENCIES,

221
00:06:34,792 --> 00:06:36,125
AND FLORIDA HAS BEEN PRETTY

222
00:06:36,126 --> 00:06:37,160
ROBUST IN DOING THAT.

223
00:06:37,161 --> 00:06:39,162
SO WE HAVE SOME IDEA HOW TO

224
00:06:39,163 --> 00:06:39,762
PREPLAN FOR THAT.

225
00:06:39,763 --> 00:06:41,731
WE DO WHAT WE CAN TO BE ABLE TO

226
00:06:41,732 --> 00:06:42,565
SUPPORT THE MOVEMENT OF PEOPLE.

227
00:06:42,566 --> 00:06:45,635
WHEN IT COMES TO GEORGIA, WE ARE

228
00:06:45,636 --> 00:06:46,970
NOT EVACUATING FOR STORM SURGE

229
00:06:46,971 --> 00:06:47,370
IN GEORGIA.

230
00:06:47,371 --> 00:06:49,205
THIS IS GOING TO BE HIGH WIND.

231
00:06:49,206 --> 00:06:52,108
WE ARE ASKING PEOPLE TO GET

232
00:06:52,109 --> 00:06:53,409
WITHIN A FACILITY THAT CAN

233
00:06:53,410 --> 00:06:55,378
WITHSTAND THE WINDS, AND TRY TO

234
00:06:55,379 --> 00:06:56,512
SHELTER IN PLACE OR SEEK OUT

235
00:06:56,513 --> 00:07:00,183
PUBLIC SHELTERS THAT MAY BE OPEN

236
00:07:00,184 --> 00:07:00,783
IN SOUTHWEST GEORGIA.

237
00:07:00,784 --> 00:07:01,451
>> President Trump: TAKE A

238
00:07:01,452 --> 00:07:04,120
LOOK AT THAT, THE RED AREA

239
00:07:04,121 --> 00:07:05,321
BASICALLY IS THE AREA THAT IS

240
00:07:05,322 --> 00:07:07,490
GOING TO HIT PRETTY HEAVILY.

241
00:07:07,491 --> 00:07:11,628
THAT IS A LOT OF SURE.

242
00:07:11,629 --> 00:07:12,528
IT'S A LOT OF LAND.

243
00:07:12,529 --> 00:07:14,163
>> THERE WILL BE STORM SURGE ALL

244
00:07:14,164 --> 00:07:15,164
THE WAY DOWN IN TAMPA BAY.

245
00:07:15,165 --> 00:07:17,767
AS YOU KNOW, IT IS VERY

246
00:07:17,768 --> 00:07:18,434
LOW-LYING AND FLOODS VERY

247
00:07:18,435 --> 00:07:18,768
EASILY.

248
00:07:18,769 --> 00:07:20,970
TO GIVE YOU THAT IDEA OF THE

249
00:07:20,971 --> 00:07:23,539
BREADTH OF ITS PAST, IT IS QUITE

250
00:07:23,540 --> 00:07:23,840
LARGE.

251
00:07:23,841 --> 00:07:24,741
>> President Trump: IS ALMOST

252
00:07:24,742 --> 00:07:25,775
THE ENTIRE SIZE OF THE GULF.

253
00:07:25,776 --> 00:07:26,976
WHEN YOU LOOK AT IT TOPICALLY,

254
00:07:26,977 --> 00:07:30,246
IT'S ALMOST THE ENTIRE SIZE OF

255
00:07:30,247 --> 00:07:30,780
THE GULF.

256
00:07:30,781 --> 00:07:31,948
THEY HAVEN'T SEEN THAT -- MAYBE

257
00:07:31,949 --> 00:07:33,149
THEY HAVEN'T SEEN THAT AT ALL.

258
00:07:33,150 --> 00:07:36,152
NOBODY HAS SEEN THAT BEFORE.

259
00:07:36,153 --> 00:07:38,354
>> OF THE EYE DIAMETER IS PRETTY

260
00:07:38,355 --> 00:07:39,656
WIDE, WHICH, UNFORTUNATELY, IS

261
00:07:39,657 --> 00:07:41,724
NOT GOOD NEWS AS IT MAKES

262
00:07:41,725 --> 00:07:42,091
LANDFALL.

263
00:07:42,092 --> 00:07:44,961
SOME PEOPLE MAY SAY IT'S SIMILAR

264
00:07:44,962 --> 00:07:46,863
TO AN EF THREE TORNADO MAKING

265
00:07:46,864 --> 00:07:47,630
LANDFALL IN AREAS THAT ARE CLOSE

266
00:07:47,631 --> 00:07:52,335
TO THE EYE.

267
00:07:52,336 --> 00:07:54,170
>> Reporter: THE

268
00:07:54,171 --> 00:07:55,171
INFRASTRUCTURE, IS THERE ANY WAY

269
00:07:55,172 --> 00:07:57,206
THEY WOULD STRUGGLE TO DEAL

270
00:07:57,207 --> 00:07:57,540
WITH --

271
00:07:57,541 --> 00:07:59,375
>> NOT NECESSARILY.

272
00:07:59,376 --> 00:08:01,144
IRMA DID NOT HEAVILY IMPACT THE

273
00:08:01,145 --> 00:08:02,111
FLORIDA PANHANDLE.

274
00:08:02,112 --> 00:08:03,179
MOST OF THE HITS FROM IRMA WERE

275
00:08:03,180 --> 00:08:05,448
IN THE SOUTHWEST PORTION OF

276
00:08:05,449 --> 00:08:05,782
FLORIDA.

277
00:08:05,783 --> 00:08:08,551
THEN IT MOVED UP AND CREATED

278
00:08:08,552 --> 00:08:11,354
SOME ISSUES IN THE JACKSONVILLE

279
00:08:11,355 --> 00:08:12,055
AREA, NORTHEASTERN PORTION.

280
00:08:12,056 --> 00:08:13,222
BUT THIS AREA, IT'S BEEN A LONG

281
00:08:13,223 --> 00:08:15,291
TIME SINCE IT HAS BEEN HIT.

282
00:08:15,292 --> 00:08:19,729
VEGETATION HASN'T BEEN STRESSED.

283
00:08:19,730 --> 00:08:21,130
WE WILL SEE A LOT OF DAMAGE AND

284
00:08:21,131 --> 00:08:21,798
DEVASTATION, UNFORTUNATELY.

285
00:08:21,799 --> 00:08:25,168
WE HAVE TO SET THE CITIZENS'

286
00:08:25,169 --> 00:08:26,636
EXPECTATIONS THAT THE POWER WILL

287
00:08:26,637 --> 00:08:27,236
BE OUT FOR A WHILE.

288
00:08:27,237 --> 00:08:30,773
FEMA'S ROLE IN THAT, AS A E WAS

289
00:08:30,774 --> 00:08:32,475
SAYING, OUR PARTNERSHIP WITH

290
00:08:32,476 --> 00:08:33,242
THOSE DIRECTORS -- WE WORK WITH

291
00:08:33,243 --> 00:08:35,411
THE FLORIDA POWER LINES, THE

292
00:08:35,412 --> 00:08:39,482
GULF POWER, THE SOUTHERN COMPAN

293
00:08:39,482 --> 00:08:40,182
COMPANY, THE GEORGIA POWER TO

294
00:08:40,183 --> 00:08:41,650
HELP FACILITATE THEIR AID TO

295
00:08:41,652 --> 00:08:42,552
COME IN.

296
00:08:42,553 --> 00:08:43,920
THEY'VE GOT POWER CREWS COMING

297
00:08:43,921 --> 00:08:46,322
IN FOR MULTIPLE STATES ACROSS

298
00:08:46,323 --> 00:08:47,657
THE COUNTRY THAT ARE ALREADY

299
00:08:47,658 --> 00:08:48,124
PRESTAGED.

300
00:08:48,125 --> 00:08:50,393
WE WORK WITH THEM TO DO WHAT'S

301
00:08:50,394 --> 00:08:51,160
CALLED THE FIRST PUSH DEBRIS TO

302
00:08:51,161 --> 00:08:54,530
GET THE ROADWAYS OPEN SO WE CAN

303
00:08:54,531 --> 00:08:55,231
GET DOWN THE ROADWAYS TO START

304
00:08:55,232 --> 00:08:55,732
FIXING THE POWER.

305
00:08:55,733 --> 00:09:03,506
THAT WILL TAKE SOME TIME.

306
00:09:03,507 --> 00:09:04,107
>> [INAUDIBLE QUESTION]

307
00:09:04,108 --> 00:09:05,108
>> President Trump: WE DON'T

308
00:09:05,109 --> 00:09:05,408
KNOW.

309
00:09:05,409 --> 00:09:06,609
I WAS GOING TO PENNSYLVANIA, IT

310
00:09:06,610 --> 00:09:08,077
LOOKS LIKE THERE WERE THOUSANDS

311
00:09:08,078 --> 00:09:10,947
OF PEOPLE ALREADY LINED UP.

312
00:09:10,948 --> 00:09:12,115
PROBABLY WE WILL DO THAT

313
00:09:12,116 --> 00:09:12,448
TONIGHT.

314
00:09:12,449 --> 00:09:13,216
WE'RE GOING TO GO DOWN HERE AS

315
00:09:13,217 --> 00:09:13,916
SOON AS WE CAN.

316
00:09:13,917 --> 00:09:16,185
WE DON'T WANT TO INTERFERE WITH

317
00:09:16,186 --> 00:00:00,000
ANYBODY, BUT WE WANT TO GO AS
