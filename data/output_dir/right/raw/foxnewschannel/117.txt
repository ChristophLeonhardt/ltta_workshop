1
00:00:01,012 --> 00:00:03,714
THOUSAND STRONG INCHES CLOSES TO

2
00:00:03,715 --> 00:00:04,448
THE UNITED STATES.

3
00:00:04,449 --> 00:00:11,121
WHAT IS BEING DONE TO STOP THAT.

4
00:00:11,122 --> 00:00:14,091
STEVE: WE HAVE A GRIFF JENKINS,

5
00:00:14,092 --> 00:00:19,930
AS THE SUN SUN COMES UP WITH VAN

6
00:00:19,931 --> 00:00:22,099
FILLED WITH PEOPLE ABOUT TO BE

7
00:00:22,100 --> 00:00:24,468
PROCESSED IN MCALLEN, TEXAS.

8
00:00:24,469 --> 00:00:26,336
WHAT DO YOU THINK OF WHAT WE'RE

9
00:00:26,337 --> 00:00:27,938
WATCHING WITH GRIFF'S LIVE

10
00:00:27,939 --> 00:00:29,306
CAMERA AT THE SOUTHERN BORDER

11
00:00:29,307 --> 00:00:30,741
WITH MEN AND WOMEN BEING

12
00:00:30,742 --> 00:00:31,108
ARRESTED?

13
00:00:31,109 --> 00:00:32,309
>> PEOPLE ARE FIGHTING FOR THEIR

14
00:00:32,310 --> 00:00:32,609
LIVES.

15
00:00:32,610 --> 00:00:33,143
THAT'S WHY.

16
00:00:33,144 --> 00:00:34,311
WHAT WOULD YOU DO?

17
00:00:34,312 --> 00:00:35,879
AND I'M NOT SAYING CONDONING

18
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:37,881
THEIR BEHAVIOR, BUT WE HAVE TO

19
00:00:37,882 --> 00:00:40,684
UNDERSTAND THAT THIS IS A

20
00:00:40,685 --> 00:00:41,318
RECURRING PROBLEM.

21
00:00:41,319 --> 00:00:42,319
I BELIEVE PRESIDENT TRUMP, WHO

22
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:44,421
IS THE ULTIMATE DEAL-MAKER,

23
00:00:44,422 --> 00:00:45,822
SHOULD BE DOING THE SAME THING

24
00:00:45,823 --> 00:00:47,858
HE DID WITH KIM JONG-UN AND CALL

25
00:00:47,859 --> 00:00:53,096
FOR AN EMERGENCY SUMMIT MEETING

26
00:00:53,097 --> 00:00:55,232
IN THE CAPITAL OF HONDURAS,

27
00:00:55,233 --> 00:00:57,634
ADVISE THE PRESIDENT OF

28
00:00:57,635 --> 00:00:59,236
HONDURAS, EL SALVADOR AND

29
00:00:59,237 --> 00:01:00,604
GUATEMALA, IN WHICH WAY THIS

30
00:01:00,605 --> 00:01:01,772
COUNTRY CAN HELP THEM.

31
00:01:01,773 --> 00:01:03,740
THIS HAPPENED BEFORE WITH

32
00:01:03,741 --> 00:01:04,174
RONALD REAGAN.

33
00:01:04,175 --> 00:01:04,708
I WAS THERE.

34
00:01:04,709 --> 00:01:07,844
I WAS UNIVISION CENTRAL AMERICAN

35
00:01:07,845 --> 00:01:11,181
BUREAU CHIEF AND I SAW HOW THE

36
00:01:11,182 --> 00:01:12,182
UNITED STATES SHOWED LEADERSHIP,

37
00:01:12,183 --> 00:01:14,551
AND HELPED OUR BACKYARD TO HAVE

38
00:01:14,552 --> 00:01:15,685
PROSPERITY AND BE ABLE TO KEEP

39
00:01:15,686 --> 00:01:16,787
THEIR BOYS HOME.

40
00:01:16,788 --> 00:01:18,121
YOU HAVE TO UNDERSTAND HONDURAS

41
00:01:18,122 --> 00:01:20,690
IS ONE OF THE MOST VIOLENT

42
00:01:20,691 --> 00:01:21,958
COUNTRY IN THE HEMISPHERE.

43
00:01:21,959 --> 00:01:23,960
YOU WOULD DO IT TOO, IF YOUR

44
00:01:23,961 --> 00:01:25,362
DAUGHTER IS FACING TO BE RAPED

45
00:01:25,363 --> 00:01:28,465
OR YOUR SON TO BE PART OF A, I'M

46
00:01:28,466 --> 00:01:30,033
NOT CONDONING, I UNDERSTAND THAT

47
00:01:30,034 --> 00:01:31,868
WE NEED TO PROTECT OUR BORDER.

48
00:01:31,869 --> 00:01:33,603
I AM A REPUBLICAN AND I BELIEVE

49
00:01:33,604 --> 00:01:35,472
THAT WE NEED TO HAVE A VERY

50
00:01:35,473 --> 00:01:36,807
STRICT BORDER SECURITY BUT YOU

51
00:01:36,808 --> 00:01:38,441
ALSO HAVE TO UNDERSTAND THAT OUR

52
00:01:38,442 --> 00:01:39,743
NEIGHBORS ARE DESPERATE.

53
00:01:39,744 --> 00:01:40,844
SO WHAT DO WE DO?

54
00:01:40,845 --> 00:01:43,113
WE HELP THEM STAY HOME.

55
00:01:43,114 --> 00:01:44,948
AINSLEY: WELL, MARIA, WE ARE

56
00:01:44,949 --> 00:01:46,550
GIVING THEM A LOT OF MONEY.

57
00:01:46,551 --> 00:01:48,251
WE'VE BEEN RUNNING NUMBERS ALL

58
00:01:48,252 --> 00:01:49,386
THIS WEEK, MILLIONS OF DOLLARS

59
00:01:49,387 --> 00:01:51,655
TO EACH OF THESE CENTRAL

60
00:01:51,656 --> 00:01:52,556
AMERICAN COUNTRIES.

61
00:01:52,557 --> 00:01:54,524
HOW ARE THEY USING THAT MONEY?

62
00:01:54,525 --> 00:01:56,927
WHY ISN'T THE COUNTRY, WHY DO WE

63
00:01:56,928 --> 00:01:58,895
CONTINUOUSLY SEEING PEOPLE

64
00:01:58,896 --> 00:02:00,630
FLEEING AND LEAVING, TALK BE

65
00:02:00,631 --> 00:02:03,033
ABOUT RAPE IN THESE COUNTRIES?

66
00:02:03,034 --> 00:02:04,734
WHAT IS OUR MONEY BEING USED

67
00:02:04,735 --> 00:02:06,203
FOR.

68
00:02:06,204 --> 00:02:08,238
>> THE MONEY IS 2 OR

69
00:02:08,239 --> 00:02:09,739
$300 MILLION EARMARKED FOR EACH

70
00:02:09,740 --> 00:02:10,574
COUNTRY.

71
00:02:10,574 --> 00:02:12,142
REALITY WE COULD EARMARK THE

72
00:02:12,143 --> 00:02:13,143
FUNDS FOR SPECIFIC PROGRAMS.

73
00:02:13,144 --> 00:02:14,711
I GO BACK TO MY IDEA.

74
00:02:14,712 --> 00:02:16,379
PRESIDENT TRUMP NEEDS TO SHOW UP

75
00:02:16,380 --> 00:02:18,114

76
00:02:18,115 --> 00:02:19,683

82
00:02:30,328 --> 00:02:31,194
WHATEVER IT TAKES.

83
00:02:31,195 --> 00:02:32,028
WE DONE IT BEFORE.

84
00:02:32,029 --> 00:02:33,230
IT IS TIME FOR THE UNITED STATES

85
00:02:33,231 --> 00:02:34,998
TO WAKE UP AND THEN WE'LL STOP

86
00:02:34,999 --> 00:02:37,467
WHAT IS HAPPENING AT THE BORDER

87
00:02:37,468 --> 00:02:38,902
RIGHT NOW AS IT HAPPENED YEARS

88
00:02:38,903 --> 00:02:40,470
AGO WITH REAGAN I JUST SAID.

89
00:02:40,471 --> 00:02:42,806
ED: MARIA, WE WANT TO BRING IN

90
00:02:42,807 --> 00:02:44,574

94
00:02:48,412 --> 00:02:50,113

YOU HEAR THE TALK, MAYBE THERE

96
00:02:51,415 --> 00:02:53,683
SHOULD A SUMMIT, MAYBE A

97
00:02:53,684 --> 00:02:55,218
EMERGENCY NEEDS TO BE DEALT

98
00:02:55,219 --> 00:02:56,653
WITH, DEMOCRATS AND REPUBLICANS

99
00:02:56,654 --> 00:02:57,687
GO BACK AND FORTH, WHAT ABOUT

100
00:02:57,688 --> 00:03:00,757
THE BORDER PATROL AGENTS BEHIND

101
00:03:00,758 --> 00:03:02,492
YOU, THEY'RE JUST TRYING TO DO

102
00:03:02,493 --> 00:03:03,627
THEIR JOB AS THIS POLITICAL

103
00:03:03,628 --> 00:03:04,895
FIGHT PLAYS OUT?

104
00:03:04,896 --> 00:03:05,528
>> ABSOLUTELY.

105
00:03:05,529 --> 00:03:07,464
REPORTER: THAT IS A GREAT POINT,

106
00:03:07,465 --> 00:03:07,764
ED.

107
00:03:07,765 --> 00:03:09,165
BORDER PATROL WOULD BE FIRST TO

108
00:03:09,166 --> 00:03:10,333
TELL YOU THEY DON'T MAKE THE

109
00:03:10,334 --> 00:03:10,734
LAWS.

110
00:03:10,735 --> 00:03:12,569
THEY ENFORCE THE LAWS AND DO A

111
00:03:12,570 --> 00:03:14,004
DARN GOOD JOB OF DOING IT.

112
00:03:14,005 --> 00:03:15,405
IF YOU ALSO TALK TO LEADERS HERE

113
00:03:15,406 --> 00:03:18,141
WITH THE BORDER PATROL THEY WILL

114
00:03:18,142 --> 00:03:19,843
TELL YOU IT IS LOOPHOLES IN

115
00:03:19,844 --> 00:03:21,811
THESE LAWS THAT DRIVE PEOPLE

116
00:03:21,812 --> 00:03:22,379
ACROSS THE BORDER.

117
00:03:22,380 --> 00:03:24,247
LET ME GIVE YOU JUST A LITTLE

118
00:03:24,248 --> 00:03:25,982
CONTEXT FOR JUST THIS TINY

119
00:03:25,983 --> 00:03:27,217
LITTLE AREA THAT YOU'VE BEEN

120
00:03:27,218 --> 00:03:29,653
SEEING THIS ACTIVITY, RIGHT?

121
00:03:29,654 --> 00:03:31,955
IT IS 300% INCREASE FOR THIS

122
00:03:31,956 --> 00:03:33,857
EXACT TIME LAST YEAR, IN TERMS

123
00:03:33,858 --> 00:03:35,659
OF NUMBERS OF FAMILY UNITS THAT

124
00:03:35,660 --> 00:03:37,193
ARE COMING HERE.

125
00:03:37,194 --> 00:03:39,596
MORE THAN 5000 PEOPLE IN THE

126
00:03:39,597 --> 00:03:41,064
LAST TWO WEEKS.

127
00:03:41,065 --> 00:03:44,301
UPWARDS OF 600-POUNDS MARIJUANA

128
00:03:44,302 --> 00:03:44,634
COMING.

129
00:03:44,635 --> 00:03:46,436
THAT IS NOT INCLUDING THE PEOPLE

130
00:03:46,437 --> 00:03:48,138
THAT ARE THESE MIDDLE-AGED TO

131
00:03:48,139 --> 00:03:49,539
YOUNG MEN THAT WE'VE SEEN

132
00:03:49,540 --> 00:03:51,408
RUNNING ALL OVER THE BORDER

133
00:03:51,409 --> 00:03:51,975
TODAY.

134
00:03:51,976 --> 00:03:54,978
SO IT IS THE DRIVER OF LOOPHOLES

135
00:03:54,979 --> 00:03:57,247
IN THE LAWS THAT IS CAUSING THIS

136
00:03:57,248 --> 00:03:57,914
TO HAPPEN.

137
00:03:57,915 --> 00:04:00,684
IF THEY DO HAVE A SUMMIT AND THE

138
00:04:00,685 --> 00:04:03,253
BORDER PATROL WOULD BE GLAD TO

139
00:04:03,254 --> 00:04:05,355
ENFORCE WHATEVER LAWS OUR

140
00:04:05,356 --> 00:04:06,756
POLITICIANS MAKE, THEY CAN'T TO

141
00:04:06,757 --> 00:04:08,625
SEE CONSISTENCY SO THERE ISN'T

142
00:04:08,626 --> 00:04:10,193
INCENTIVE ON THE PART OF THE

143
00:04:10,194 --> 00:04:11,494
CARTELS WHO ARE RUTHLESS AND

144
00:04:11,495 --> 00:04:13,029
VERY MUCH WATCHING WHAT WE'RE

145
00:04:13,030 --> 00:04:14,998
DOING IN THIS COUNTRY.

146
00:04:14,999 --> 00:04:16,733
STEVE: GO AHEAD, MARIA.

147
00:04:16,733 --> 00:04:18,567
THE BORDER PATROLS ARE THE

148
00:04:18,569 --> 00:04:18,902
HEROES.

149
00:04:18,903 --> 00:04:19,736
I.C.E. IS THE HEROES.

150
00:04:19,737 --> 00:04:21,304
THEY'RE JUST FOLLOWING RULES

151
00:04:21,305 --> 00:04:22,038
FROM WASHINGTON.

152
00:04:22,039 --> 00:04:23,707
THAT IS WHY WASHINGTON NEEDS TO

153
00:04:23,708 --> 00:04:26,676
STEP UP TO THE PLATE AND SHOW

154
00:04:26,677 --> 00:04:27,077
LEADERSHIP.

155
00:04:27,078 --> 00:04:28,511
THE PEOPLE THAT ARE COMING, I'M

156
00:04:28,512 --> 00:04:31,481
SURE THAT "EL CHAPO" IS SENDING

157
00:04:31,482 --> 00:04:32,816
A LOT OF DRUGS.

158
00:04:32,817 --> 00:04:34,884
I'M SURE COYOTES ARE SMUGGLING A

159
00:04:34,885 --> 00:04:37,654
LOT OF PEOPLE BUT OVERWHELMING

160
00:04:37,655 --> 00:04:38,488
MAJORITY OF THE PEOPLE ARE

161
00:04:38,489 --> 00:04:39,356
FACING DEATH.

162
00:04:39,357 --> 00:04:40,757
THEY'RE UNDER THE THREAT OF

163
00:04:40,758 --> 00:04:41,057
DEATH.

164
00:04:41,058 --> 00:04:42,459
WHAT WOULD YOU DO?

165
00:04:42,460 --> 00:04:43,893
HEY, BECAUSE WE ARE THE BEST

166
00:04:43,894 --> 00:04:44,928
COUNTRY IN THE HEMISPHERE.

167
00:04:44,929 --> 00:04:45,895
THEY KNOW IT.

168
00:04:45,896 --> 00:04:47,297
THEY KNOW AMERICANS WILL TREAT

169
00:04:47,298 --> 00:04:50,700
THEM A LOT BETTER THAN HONDURAN

170
00:04:50,701 --> 00:04:51,067
OFFICIALS.

171
00:04:51,068 --> 00:04:53,203
ED: YOU'RE RUNNING IN OPEN SEAT.

172
00:04:53,204 --> 00:04:57,707
I WILL YAWN ROS-LEHTINEN,

173
00:04:57,708 --> 00:04:58,074
RETIRING.

174
00:04:58,075 --> 00:04:59,275
DONNA SHALALA FROM CLINTON

175
00:04:59,276 --> 00:04:59,609
CABINET.

176
00:04:59,610 --> 00:05:01,678
A LOT OF DEMOCRATS ASSUMED

177
00:05:01,679 --> 00:05:03,546
WRONGLY SHE WOULD BE A SHOO-IN

178
00:05:03,547 --> 00:05:04,481
THIS SEAT.

179
00:05:04,482 --> 00:05:06,649
IT IS NOW BASICALLY A TOSS-UP

180
00:05:06,650 --> 00:05:07,951
DOWN THERE IN SOUTH FLORIDA.

181
00:05:07,952 --> 00:05:11,221
HOW BIG OF ISSUE IS ILLEGAL

182
00:05:11,222 --> 00:05:12,188
IMMIGRATION IN THIS RACE?

183
00:05:12,189 --> 00:05:14,057
>> IT IS, BUT WE UNDERSTAND IT

184
00:05:14,058 --> 00:05:14,591
VERY WELL.

185
00:05:14,592 --> 00:05:17,327
WE'RE THE ULTIMATE MELTING POT.

186
00:05:17,328 --> 00:05:19,029
I CAN ADVISE NOT ONLY THE

187
00:05:19,030 --> 00:05:19,796
PRESIDENT BUT WHOLE LEADERSHIP

188
00:05:19,797 --> 00:05:20,430
IN CONGRESS.

189
00:05:20,431 --> 00:05:21,865
