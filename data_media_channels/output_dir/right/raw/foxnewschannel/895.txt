1
00:00:00,126 --> 00:00:01,194
TO RUN PERSONAL ERRANDS.

2
00:00:01,194 --> 00:00:04,364
BUT AT THIS POINT HE STILL HAS A

3
00:00:04,364 --> 00:00:07,734
REPORT OF THE PRESIDENT HIMSELF.

4
00:00:07,734 --> 00:00:09,636
>> Bret: KEVIN CORKE LIVE ON

INSPECTOR GENERAL REPORT.

9
00:00:17,210 --> 00:00:18,411
HE WAS CATHERINE HERRIDGE.

10
00:00:18,411 --> 00:00:21,014
>> AT LEAST TWO CAMPAIGN AIDES

11
00:00:21,014 --> 00:00:23,416
HAVE PLEADED GUILTY TO THE

12
00:00:23,416 --> 00:00:25,919
VIOLATION OF U.S. 182001.

13
00:00:25,919 --> 00:00:27,587
THE REPORT ABOUT FBI PERSONNEL

14
00:00:27,587 --> 00:00:29,389
DISMISSED THE IDEA THAT ANYONE

15
00:00:29,389 --> 00:00:30,790
WOULD BE PROSECUTED FOR

16
00:00:30,790 --> 00:00:31,992
MISLEADING INVESTIGATORS.

17
00:00:31,992 --> 00:00:34,094
IN AN EFFECT ON MIKE

18
00:00:34,094 --> 00:00:37,597
UNIDENTIFIED AGENT WE ROLLED

19
00:00:37,597 --> 00:00:38,431
HILLARY CLINTON AID ABOUT ACCESS

20
00:00:38,431 --> 00:00:39,632
TO SECURITY AT THE CLINTON HOME

21
00:00:39,632 --> 00:00:42,102
KNOWN AS A SKIFF WHICH IS PROVEN

22
00:00:42,102 --> 00:00:46,439
TO BE OFF CLEARANCE.

23
00:00:46,439 --> 00:00:47,540
AGENT ONE, AWESOME.

24
00:00:47,540 --> 00:00:49,409
LIED TO HIS BLANKET OFF.

25
00:00:49,409 --> 00:00:50,977
WENT FROM NEVER ALONE LOOKING AT

THERE WAS A SECURE FAX, I DID

31
00:01:00,553 --> 00:01:03,390
WITH HRC.

32
00:01:03,390 --> 00:01:03,823
RIDICULOUS.

33
00:01:03,823 --> 00:01:06,326
IT WOULD BE FUNNY IF HE WAS THE

34
00:01:06,326 --> 00:01:08,228
ONLY GUY CHARGED IN THIS DEAL.

35
00:01:08,228 --> 00:01:09,662
EVEN IF HE SAID THE TRUTH AND

36
00:01:09,662 --> 00:01:10,296
DIDN'T HAVE CLEARANCE WHEN

37
00:01:10,296 --> 00:01:14,768
HANDLING THE SECURE FAX, NO ONE

38
00:01:14,768 --> 00:01:16,036
WILL DO BLANK.

I SENT OR RECEIVED WAS MARKED

43
00:01:23,109 --> 00:01:25,678
CLASSIFIED AND NOTHING HAS BEEN

44
00:01:25,678 --> 00:01:27,480
DEMONSTRATED TO CONTRADICT THAT.

45

>> FOX NEWS FIRST REPORTED THAT

46
