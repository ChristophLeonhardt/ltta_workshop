AS ALWAYS ONCE A SHOOTER'S
NAME GETS OUT, WE MIND THE
INTERNET
TO FIND THEM.
THEY FOUND THIS
GUY ONLINE AND FOUND THAT HE
ABSOLUTELY DESPISED REPUBLICANS
AND DONALD TRUMP IN PARTICULAR.
HE PREVIOUSLY SAID THINGS ABOUT
THE CONGRESSMAN THAT WAS SHOT,
BUT ALSO THAT HE HAD LIKED
BERNIE SANDERS AT SOME POINT.
HE
HAD APPARENTLY VOLUNTEERED FOR
BERNIE SANDERS.
MANY ON THE
RIGHT EVEN SOME LIBERALS THOUGHT
THEY COULD CASH IN ON THIS.
SO
THE ATTACKS AGAINST BERNIE
SANDERS AND HIS SUPPORTERS BEGAN
IMMEDIATELY.
BERNIE SANDERS DID
NOT NEED TO COMMENT ON THIS BUT
TO HIS CREDIT HE DID IN WRITTEN
FORM AND ON THE FLOOR OF
CONGRESS.
I HAVE JUST BEEN INFORMED
THAT THE ALLEGED SHOOTER THE
REPUBLICAN BASEBALL PRACTICE
THIS MORNING, WAS SOMEONE WHO
APPARENTLY VOLUNTEER MY
PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN.
I AM
SICKENED BY THIS DESPICABLE ACT,
AND LET ME BE AS CLEAR AS I CAN
BE, VIOLENCE OF ANY KIND IS
UNACCEPTABLE IN OUR SOCIETY, AND
I CONDEMN THIS ACTION IN THE
STRONGEST POSSIBLE TERMS.
REAL
CHANGE CAN ONLY COME ABOUT
THROUGH NONVIOLENT ACTION AND
ANYTHING ELSE RUNS COUNTER TO
OUR MOST DEEPLY HELD AMERICAN
VALUES.
I KNOW I SPEAK FOR THE
ENTIRE COUNTRY AND SAYING THAT
MY HOPES AND PRAYERS ARE THAT
REPRESENTATIVE SCALISE,
CONGRESSIONAL STAFF, AND THE
POLICE OFFICERS WHO WERE WOUNDED
MAKE A QUICK AND FULL RECOVERY.
I ALSO WANT TO THINK THE CAPITAL
POLICE FOR THEIR HEROIC
ACTIONS TO PREVENT FURTHER HARM.
I'M GLAD HE MADE THAT
COMMENT.
WHAT I NOTICED IS THAT
IT IS THE MESSAGE THAT HAS BEEN
DELIVERING FOR OVER 41 YEARS.
THE PEOPLE THAT ARE SAYING THAT
HE 
COULD BE RESPONSIBLE HAS
NEVER LISTENED TO BERNIE SANDERS
SPEAK.
ONE OF THE THINGS ABOUT
BERNIE THAT WE ALL UNDERSTOOD
EARLY ON IS THAT ONE OF THE
BENEFITS IS THAT HE DOESN'T DRAW
IN TRADITIONAL DEMOCRATS OR
LIPS, HIS APPEAL IS BROADER.
THAT MEANS MODERATES AND
CONSERVATIVES LIKE HIM, OR AT
LEAST SOME OF HIS POLICIES.
GOD
ONLY KNOWS WHAT THIS GUY'S
BACKGROUND WAS FIVE OR 10 YEARS
AGO.
WHEN YOU POINT OUT IN THE
WAKE OF A TERROR ATTACK,
SOMETIMES ON TYT WE HAVE
CRITICIZED THE RHETORIC COMING
OUT OF THE MEDIA FIGURES OR
POLITICIANS.
YOU MIGHT THINK
THIS IS HYPOCRITICAL THAT BERNIE
SANDERS IS RESPONSIBLE.
BUT
POLITICIANS ARE NOT RESPONSIBLE
FOR WHAT THEIR SUPPORTERS DO IN
THE ABSTRACT, THEY ARE
RESPONSIBLE WITH THEIR RHETORIC.
AND DONALD TRUMP DID THAT
MULTIPLE TIMES DURING HIS
CAMPAIGN.
HE ALSO DID IT DURING
PARTICULAR POLITICIANS.
THAT 
HAS
BEEN THE CASE OF PEOPLE IN THE
RIGHT-WING MEDIA.
IF BERNIE
SANDERS HAD SAID THE 1% HAS TOO
MUCH MONEY, YOU CAN CHOP THEIR
HEADS OFF, HE WOULD BE
RESPONSIBLE.
BUT THAT IS NOT AN
ACTUAL QUOTE.
LOOK IT UP.
I ALSO THINK YOU CAN'T
CONFLATE WHAT ONE PERSON
BELIEVES WITH WHAT AN ENTIRE
MOVEMENT BELIEVES OR WHAT A
COUPLE OF PEOPLE BELIEVE.
MY
ISSUE IS YOU CAN ONLY HOLD
BERNIE SANDERS RESPONSIBLE FOR
WHAT HAS COME OUT OF HIS MOUTH.
HE HAS NOT ONCE INCITED
VIOLENCE.
IF YOU THINK HIS
RHETORIC IS THE SAME AS TERMS,
PLEASE SHOW IT TO ME.
NOW IF YOU
WANT TO TALK ABOUT SOME ON THE
LEFT WHO MIGHT INCITE VIOLENCE
USING RHETORIC MAYBE THOSE CASES
DO HAPPEN?
KATHY GRIFFIN'S
RIDICULOUS PHOTO, WE SPOKE OUT
AGAINST IT.
IT WAS BAD IMAGERY
AND YOU WANT TO ENCOURAGE PEOPLE
TO COMMIT ACTS OF VIOLENCE.
BUT
BLAMING BERNIE SANDERS IS
RIDICULOUS.
I'M NOT JUST TALKING
TO CONSERVATIVES, BECAUSE WE SEE
LIBERALS DOING IT AS WELL.
JOY READ.
SHE'S NUTS.
YOU HIT IT ON THE HEAD WHEN
YOU SAID THIS CONFLATION BETWEEN
WHATEVER THE ALRIGHT IS WITH
THIS ALL LEFT IDEA 
JUST DOESN'T
EXIST.
EVEN THIS GUY, HE
ABANDONED BERNIE SANDERS AND
BRACED HILLARY'S CAMPAIGN.
IT IS
ABSURDLY DISINGENUOUS TO ZERO
IN.
HE TWEETED SOME THINGS AFTER
THE ELECTION THAT SEEMED MORE
SUPPORTIVE OF HILLARY, BUT I
READ THAT HE SAID YOU SHOULD
EITHER THEORETICALLY RIGHT IN
BERNIE OR VOTE FOR JOEL STEIN.
BUT LATER ON HE SAID HE
FOCUSED ON JUST DONALD TRUMP AND
SAID HILLARY DIDN'T DO ANYTHING
WRONG.
BUT IT DOESN'T MATTER.
THE ONLY PERSON WHO IS
RESPONSIBLE IS THE SHOOTER AND
ANYONE WHO MIGHT'VE ENCOURAGED
HIM 単 RIGHT NOW WE DON'T KNOW
WHO ENCOURAGED HIM OR IF ANYONE
INCITED VIOLENCE.
THE ONE THING
WE DO KNOW IS THAT BERNIE
SANDERS IS NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR
THIS.
HE DOES NOT CONDONE
VIOLENCE AND HAS NEVER EVER
ENCOURAGED VIOLENCE.
AND TO USE
YOUR DISDAIN FOR BERNIE SANDERS
OR USE THIS HORRIBLE TRAGIC
EVENT IN ORDER TO SHOW YOUR
DISDAIN SHOWS THAT YOU JUST HAVE
AN AGENDA AND YOU DON'T REALLY
CARE ABOUT THE FACTS.
YOU JUST WANT TO PLACE THE
BLAME ON SOMEONE.
SO WHY ZERO IN ON BERNIE
SANDERS?
IT IS JUST COMPLETELY
DISINGENUOUS AND HORRIBLE.
I KNOW SHE IS JUST ONE PERSON
WHO HAS DONE THIS AND THERE ARE
A LOT OTHERS BUT THE JOY RETWEET
単
WHAT IS GOING ON WITH HER?
SHE TOOK SOME FAKE FACT THAT
WAS TWEETED TO HER AND AGREED
WITH IT.
THAT BERNIE'S CAREER
HAS BEEN PROPPED UP BY THE NRA.
WHAT?
THAT WAS HER TAKE.
WOW.
I KNOW PARTIES ARE COMPLEX
AND THERE ARE MULTIPLE FACTIONS
AND THE IDEA THAT PEOPLE ARE
TRYING TO KEEP THINGS ARE SIMPLY
GOING TO LAY DOWN AND LET THE
NEW GROUP TAKE OVER?
I KNEW THAT
WAS NOT GOING TO HAPPEN.
BUT WE
CAN HAVE AN ACTUAL DEBATE ABOUT
THINGS WE HAVE SAID.
WE ARE NOT
GOING TO HAVE THAT DEBATE BY
MAKING UP RIDICULOUS BS AND
SMEARING A GUY WHO HAS MORE
INTEGRITY THAN ANY OTHER
POLITICIAN IN WASHINGTON AT THIS
POINT.
COMMENTING ON THIS IS ONE OF
THE MOST ANNOYING THINGS BECAUSE
I CAN'T WIN.
REALLY CARE ABOUT
WINNING BUT YOU HAVE THE
HARD-CORE BERNIE SUPPORTERS WHO
THINK I AM A CORPORATIST, AND
THEN YOU HAVE THE HILLARY PEOPLE
THAT ARE LIKE YOU ARE PART OF
THE REASON WHY HILLARY LOST THE
ELECTION.
EVERYONE HATES ME AND
THINKS WE ARE TERRIBLE.
WHATEVER, I DON'T CARE.
BUT WHAT
I DO CARE ABOUT IS JUST KEEPING
IT REAL WITH BOTH SIDES,
ESPECIALLY THE SIDE THE JOY READ
IS ON.
IF YOU ARE FRUSTRATED AT
THE FACT THAT HILLARY LOST THE
ELECTION INSTEAD OF GETTING
ANGRY AND ANTAGONIZING PEOPLE,
ONE OF YOU LISTEN TO THEM AND
LISTEN TO THEIR ACTUAL CONCERNS.
DEMONIZING THEM WILL NOT BODE
WELL FOR YOU OR YOUR PARTY TO
YEARS FROM NOW AND CERTAINLY NOT
THREE TO HALF YEARS FROM NOW.
WAKE UP.
THEY ARE JUST SO BITTER
ABOUT THE FACT THAT THEY LOST.
MAYBE THEY HAVE REAL GENUINE
CONCERNS WE NEED TO REPRESENT?
THEY ARE INCAPABLE OF SELF
CRITIQUE.
THEY CAN'T LOOK AT WHY
THEY LOST, AND HOW THEY CAN WIN.
IF CORBIN WASN'T REVEALING OF
HOW THE LEFT ACTUALLY DOES HAVE
A LOT OF STANDING 単 AGAIN THE
CONFLATION OF TRYING TO TIE THIS
HORSESHOE THEORY WHERE YOU ARE
SO LEFT, AND JUST APOLOGIZING
FOR THIS.
I'M AT SOME POINT GOING TO
HAVE TO SIT DOWN AND ORGANIZE MY
THOUGHTS ON THIS.
THERE IS THIS
WEIRD IDEA 単 THIS OBSESSION OF
SHOWING HOW IDEOLOGICALLY PURE
UR.
THERE IS ONE SPECTRUM YOU
CAN BE ON. AND AS YOU DO THINGS
YOU ARE JUST MOVING TO THE LEFT
AND THE RIGHT.
THAT IS NOT HOW
LIFE IS.
LIFE IS MORE
COMPLICATED THAN THAT.
YOU CAN
MOVE MORE PROGRESSIVE OR MORE
CONSERVATIVE YOU CAN ALSO MOVE
MORE WISE OR LESS WISE, MORE
FOOLISH OR MORE AGGRESSIVE.
THOSE ARE NOT THE SAME THINGS.
YOU CAN HAVE WHATEVER POSITION
YOU WANT ON POLITICS BUT CAN
ALSO
BE A REAL BIG FUCKING ASSHOLE.
PEOPLE NEED TO BE ANALYTICAL BUT
NOT JUST ABOUT THEIR POLITICAL
VALUES AND GOALS, BUT ALSO
EVERYTHING ELSE THAT MAKES A
HUMAN.
