>> Sandra: CRITICS SLAMMING
"THE NEW YORK TIMES" FOR THIS
PIECE YESTERDAY AT THE HEIGHT
OF DEADLY CLASHES ON THE GAZA
BORDER WITH ISRAEL.
THE HEADLINE READING ISRAEL
KILLS 58 AND INJURES OVER 1300
BY GUNFIRE AT GAZA BORDER.
THE ARTICLE FAILED TO MENTION
THE HAMAS MILITANTS' DISGUISED
AS PROTESTORS WHO ISRAEL BLAMES
FOR FIRING UP TENSIONS UNTIL
THE 42nd PARAGRAPH OF ITS MAIN
STORY LAST NIGHT.
HOWIE KURTZ IS A FOX NEWS MEDIA
ANALYST AND HAS SOME THOUGHTS
ON THAT THIS MORNING.
HOWIE.
>> THIS IS THE PROBLEM FOR
JOURNALISM THAT GOES BEYOND
"THE NEW YORK TIMES." YES, WE
CAN DEBATE THE LEVEL OF THE
ISRAELI RESPONSE.
YES, WE CAN DEBATE THE ROLE OF
PRESIDENT TRUMP'S DECISION TO
MOVE THE EMBASSY.
BUT THIS WAS A CONFRONTATION
THAT WAS ORCHESTRATED BY HAMAS
KNOWING FULL WELL THERE WOULD
BE CASUALTIES FOR PROPAGANDA
PURPOSES.
HERE IS WHAT IS LEFT OUT OR
MINIMIZED IN THE COVERAGE.
FOR EXAMPLE, HAMAS SENT SOME
WOMEN TOWARD THE FENCE KNOWING
THEY WOULD MAKE MORE
SYMPATHETIC VICTIMS.
THE SUPPOSEDLY UNARMED
PROTESTORS SOME HAD EXPLOSIVES
TO ATTACK THE ISRAELI SIDE AND
ISRAEL THAT DROPPED LEAFLETS IN
THE AREA WARNING THE
PALESTINIANS TO STAY AWAY FROM
THE FENCE.
HAMAS WANTED THIS CONFRONTATION.
>> Sandra: THEN THERE IS THIS.
THE COVER OF THE DAILY NEWS
HERE IN NEW YORK WITH A SMILING
IVANKA TRUMP ON THE COVER
TITLED DADDY'S LITTLE GHOUL.
IVANKA ALL SMILES AT UNVEIL.
>> I FIND THE COVER TO BE
PATHETIC.
WE KNOW THE DAILY NEWS, TO
SINGLE THEM OUT.
OTHERS QUESTIONED WHY WERE THEY
THERE?
THEY'RE THE HIGHEST RANKING
JEWISH AMERICANS IN THE WHITE
HOUSE.
OF COURSE THEY WOULD BE THERE
AND EMPHASIZING WHAT THEY SEE
AS THE ADMINISTRATION'S POLICY
WHICH BY THE WAY MANY PREVIOUS
PRESIDENTS HAVE TALKED ABOUT
BUT NOT ACTUALLY DONE IN MOVING
THE EMBASSY TO JERUSALEM.
BUT THE OTHER THING HERE IS THE
SPLIT SCREEN COVERAGE.
THE PICTURES, REGARDLESS OF THE
HEADLINES HAMAS GETS THE
CELEBRATION AT THE DEDICATION
OF THE EMBASSY AND ALL THE
VIOLENCE AT THE PROTESTS WHICH
AGAIN HAMAS CLEARLY
PRECIPITATED AND THAT MAKES THE
ISRAELI SIDE LOOK BAD BECAUSE
WHEN YOU GLANCE AT IT, YOU
DON'T REALIZE IT'S INCUMBENT ON
JOURNALISTS TO POINT THIS OUT.
IT WAS A CONFRONTATION THAT
HAMAS WANTED.
WANTS THE VIOLENCE.
IT WANTS CASUALTIES BECAUSE
THAT HELPS IT PAINT ISRAEL AS
SOME KIND OF A MILITARY THUGISH
NATION.
>> Sandra: WE HEARD FROM NIKKI
HALEY TALKING ABOUT YESTERDAY'S
OPENING OF THE EMBASSY IN
JERUSALEM SAYING IT WAS A CAUSE
FOR CELEBRATION FOR THE
AMERICAN PEOPLE.
SHE SAID MOVING THE U.S.
EMBASSY TO JERUSALEM WAS THE
RIGHT THING TO DO.
IT REFLECTS THE WILL OF THE
AMERICAN PEOPLE.
LISTEN TO HER HERE.
>> THOSE WHO SUGGEST THE GAZA
VIOLENCE HAS ANYTHING TO DO
WITH THE LOCATION OF THE
AMERICAN EMBASSY ARE SORELY
MISTAKEN.
RATHER, THE VIOLENCE COMES FROM
THOSE WHO REJECT THE EXISTENCE
OF THE STATE OF ISRAEL IN ANY
LOCATION.
SUCH A MOTIVATION, THE
DESTRUCTION OF A UNITED NATIONS
MEMBER STATE IS SO ILLEGITIMATE
AS TO NOT BE WORTH OUR TIME IN
THE SECURITY COUNCIL.
OTHER THAN THE TIME IT TAKES TO
DENOUNCE IT.
>> Sandra: WANT TO GET YOUR
FINE AT THOUGHTS THERE AS WE
HEARD FROM AMBASSADOR NIKKI
HALEY.
>> I CAN'T QUITE AGREE THE
DECISION TO MOVE THE EMBASSY
HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH THE
VIOLENCE.
IT DID INFURIATE THE
PALESTINIAN SIDE.
AT THE SAME TIME THE PROPER
RESPONSE IS NOT TO SEND
PROTESTORS TO A BORDER AREA
WITH EXPLOSIVES AND INCENDIARY
KITES.
THERE IS A DANGER FOR WESTERN
JOURNALISTS TO SIMPLY SAY WELL,
ISRAEL SHOT ALL THESE PEOPLE
WHEN CLEARLY THAT WAS THE
RESPONSE THAT HAMAS WANTED.
BY THE WAY, ISRAEL VOLUNTARILY
PULLED OUT OF GAZA 13 YEARS AGO.
TURNED IT OVER TO HAMAS TO RUN.
IT WOULDN'T BE AN OCCUPYING
MILITARY POWER AND THIS IS THE
KIND OF THING HAMAS CONTINUES
TO DO.
>> Sandra: SHE CONCLUDED BY
