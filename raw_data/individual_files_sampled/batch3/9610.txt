DANA? Dana: THANK YOU. JOINING ME FOR MORE ON THIS, MATT BENNETT, CO-FOUNDER OF THIRD WAY, AND FORMER CONGRESS WOMAN FROM NEW YORK ON THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS OF THE INDEPENDENT WOMEN'S FORUM. MATT, I WANTED TO READ TO YOU A TWEET THAT I SAW FROM THE OBAMA COMMUNICATIONS. HE SAID ARGUE ALL YOU WANT. WHY DO IT BEFORE A RACE? WHY DID SENATOR WARREN HAVE TO DO HER ANNOUNCEMENT NOW? WHY CAN'T DEMS EVER STAY FOCUSED? THREE QUESTION MARKS? I THINK YOU RAISE A FAIR POINT. IT'S CLEAR SENATOR WARREN WAS RIGHT ABOUT ALL OF THIS. PROBABLY WILL MEAN THE RACIST SLUR THE PRESIDENT'S BEEN USING TO DESCRIBE HER LOSES SOME OF ITS PUNCH. BUT I DO WISH SHE HAD WAITED A MONTH. THIS IS A BIG MID TERM COMING UP. Dana: IT IS A HUGE MIDTERMS. THE PRESIDENT WOULD LIKE NOTHING MORE THAN TALK ABOUT THIS. IF SHE IS 1/1024 NATIVE AMERICAN, DID SHE BENEFIT FROM PUTTING HER HERITAGE ON THESE FORMS AND THEN IDENTIFYING THAT WAY? SHE MUST BE NOTED THAT SHE PUT HER HERITAGE CLAIM ON THE FORMS ON THE BASIS OF FAMILY LORE. AND TO HER GREAT RELIEF NOW, SHE HAS FOUND THAT SHE IS, IN FACT, 1/1000, THAT'S THE ACTUAL FIGURE, I GUESS, NATIVE AMERICAN. THAT IS LESS THAN THE AVERAGE AMONG AMERICANS INTERESTINGLY ENOUGH. SHE'S LIKE .09%. ON AVERAGE, AMERICANS ARE 1.4%. ASIDE FROM ALL OF THAT, INDEED I WOULD SAY THE PRESIDENT WAS POKING FUN AT HER NOT IN A RACIST WAY, BUT IN A JOVIAL WAY. Dana: THE LEFT TAKES IT THAT WAY. NATIVE AMERICANS TAKE IT THAT WAY. DON'T BELIEVE ME. ASK NATIVE AMERICANS WHAT THEY THINK ABOUT THIS Dana: MATT. WHAT THE PRESIDENT HAS DONE IS CALLED HER BY A RACIST AND OBNOXIOUS TERM AND HE'S BEEN ASKED NOT TO DO IT BY NATIVE AMERICANS AND KEEPS DOING IT. I THINK NATIVE AMERICANS WOULD BE MORE OFFENDED BY SOMEONE SAYING THEY ARE NATIVE AMERICAN. ELIZABETH WARREN WOULD BE A DISASTER FOR THE UNITED STATES. SHE IS IN FAVOR OF BRINGING BACK Dana: WHY DON'T WE TALK ABOUT THAT? THE MIDTERM ELECTIONS FOR THE DEMOCRATS, THEY HAVE INVESTED A LOT. THEY HAVE RECRUITMENT UP, ENTHUSIASM UP. BUT 2020, IT'S RIGHT AROUND THE CORNER. THERE'S A POLL FROM CNN THAT TOOK THESE THREE PEOPLE. I THINK WE HAVE THEIR PERCENTAGES THERE. MATT, DO YOU THINK JOE BIDEN AT 33%, THAT IS MOSTLY AT THIS POINT A NAME I.D.? I THINK IT'S ALMOST ENTIRELY THAT. WE HAVE A BIG FIELD, AS YOU'VE DISCUSSED MANY TIMES ON THIS SHOW. MOST OF THOSE PEOPLE NO ONE'S EVER HEARD OF OUTSIDE OF YOUR OWN STATE DISTRICTS. JOE BIDEN HAS 100% NAME I.D. Dana: THE DAY AFTER THE MIDTERM, DEMOCRATS ARE ALL GONNA START TO RUN AND THEY COULD HAVE TWICE THE NUMBER OF CANDIDATES RUNNING THAN THE REPUBLICANS DID IN 2016. RIGHT. WELL, DANA, IT'S TWICE AS MANY CANDIDATES ALL RUNNING ON THE WRONG PLATFORM FOR THIS COUNTRY. SO I THINK THE PRESIDENT WILL HAVE A LOT OF FUN POKING HOLES IN THEIR ARGUMENTS AND, YOU KNOW, LET'S FACE IT. EVERY ONE OF THOSE CANDIDATES HAS AN ACHILLES HEEL. Dana: DO WANT TO ASK YOU ABOUT THE TEXAS RACE BETWEEN BETO O'ROURKE AND TED CRUZ. WE'VE BEEN READING FOR MONTHS VERY GLOWING FEATURE STORY OF BETO O'ROURKE. HE HAS RAISED $38 MILLION. THE LATEST POLL SHOWS HE'S DOWN FROM TED CRUZ AT 54%, O'ROURKE AT 45% GOING INTO MIDTERMS. THERE WERE QUESTIONS OVER THE WEEKEND FROM SOME DEMOCRATS SAYING SHOULD BETO O'ROURKE, SHOULD HE SHARE SOME OF THAT $38 MILLION WITH OTHER DEMOCRATS GOING INTO THE MIDTERMS? I THINK IT'S HARD TO DO, TO ASK SOMEBODY WHO IS IN THE HEAT OF BATTLE TO GIVE AWAY MONEY THAT'S BEEN DONATED TO HIM. THOSE DONORS EXPECT IT TO BE USED IN HIS RACE. STATES LIKE TEXAS ARE FOOL'S GOLD FOR THE OTHER SIDE UNTIL THEY'RE NOT. RIGHT? PENNSYLVANIA WAS ALWAYS THAT WAY FOR REPUBLICANS. FOR CYCLE AFTER CYCLE, REPUBLICANS INVEST IN PENNSYLVANIA. Dana: MICHIGAN, TOO. THEN THE WALL CRUMBLED. THAT COULD HAPPEN IN TEXAS. WE DON'T KNOW. NEITHER DOES BETO. Dana: LET ME ASK YOU ABOUT TENNESSEE. BLACKBURN PULLING AWAY. NEW YORK TIMES POLL 54, 45 PERCENT. PHIL BREDESEN TRYING TO RUN AS A MODERATE. IF YOU CANNOT WIN THERE IN TENNESSEE, CAN YOU NOT WIN AT ALL? MARSHA BLACKBURN HAS BEEN A GREAT REPRESENTATIVE FOR TENNESSEE. SHE'S BEEN A GREAT ADVOCATE FOR THE MUSIC INDUSTRY. AND FOR TAXPAYERS AND FOR JOBS AND WAGES. SHE HAS EVERY ARGUMENT ON HER SIDE. GOVERNOR DREDESEN, FORMER GOVERNOR BREDESEN, THERE'S REPORTS THAT HE HELPED SOME KEY AIDES AVOID PUBLIC RELEASE OF DOCUMENTS RELATING TO THEIR OWN SEXUAL HARASSMENT PROBLEMS. IN A ME TOO ERA, YOU KNOW, THAT KIND OF THING DOES NOT SIT WELL. Dana: I SHOULD POINT OUT THERE IS ANOTHER POLL WHERE HE IS ONLY DOWN BY ONE. IT'S NOT NECESSARILY A DONE DEAL
