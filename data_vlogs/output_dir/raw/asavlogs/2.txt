1
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:13,140
*cheering*

2
00:00:18,940 --> 00:00:20,300
Yeah Yeah Yeah

3
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:25,800
the hardest part ... ah...

4
00:00:26,700 --> 00:00:29,020
at such an appearance is mostly the beginning

5
00:00:29,980 --> 00:00:31,320
And then I said to myself "okay..."

6
00:00:32,020 --> 00:00:33,960
"Just do it on the fly and don't prepare anything"

7
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:39,220
the result was "yeah yeah yeah"

8
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:42,980
jep...

9
00:00:46,040 --> 00:00:48,340
Actually I hate people who say "yeah yeah yeah"

10
00:00:49,480 --> 00:00:50,040
right?

11
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,960
People who say "yeah, yeah, yeah"

12
00:00:53,300 --> 00:00:57,020
also don't hesitate to say "Na sichi"

13
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:02,600
those people are so awkward, man.

14
00:01:04,340 --> 00:01:05,960
These are the same people,

15
00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:11,500
that used to start their answer in the english lessons with "well..."

16
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:22,960
These are the same people, because of which the class outing had to end early ...

17
00:01:23,140 --> 00:01:25,140
... because they suddenly had nose bleeding.

18
00:01:28,580 --> 00:01:31,280
"We gotta go home, Daniel is bleeding!"

19
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:34,520
"why though?"

20
00:01:35,500 --> 00:01:37,240
Nothing happened, man

21
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:41,140
just kidding

22
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:44,660
I'm from Berlin-Neukölln

23
00:01:46,180 --> 00:01:48,840
When the nose of some Daniel was bleeding at our place, ...

24
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:51,660
it had a reason

25
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:04,000
For those of you who don't know Neukölln

26
00:02:04,700 --> 00:02:09,480
...ahm compared to Neukölln, Chorweiler (district of Cologne) is Monaco

27
00:02:14,580 --> 00:02:16,580
I had a schoolmate called "Engin"

28
00:02:17,060 --> 00:02:18,780
and Engin was quite tall...

29
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:21,320
...and quite strong...

30
00:02:22,180 --> 00:02:24,040
...and indeed willing to use violence...

31
00:02:25,900 --> 00:02:28,280
Engin just always punched everybody

32
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:29,620
just...

33
00:02:30,940 --> 00:02:32,180
just for no reason

34
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:39,620
And at our school in Neukölln there were guidance counselors and arbiters

35
00:02:39,620 --> 00:02:43,520
and their job was to make sure that not more than 4 students died per lesson.

36
00:02:46,420 --> 00:02:48,420
And one of them was Mr Gericke

37
00:02:49,380 --> 00:02:50,400
you already hear it ...

38
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:52,020
...victim!

39
00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:56,120
honestly, show me one cool Mr Gericke!

40
00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:00,260
and if a Mr Gericke is here tonight ...

41
00:03:03,060 --> 00:03:06,540
anyway...Mr Gericke wanted to call a halt to Engin

42
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:09,560
so he built up all of his "Mr-Gericke"-courage...

43
00:03:10,420 --> 00:03:13,140
and trudged towards Engin, like this:

44
00:03:23,780 --> 00:03:24,500
Engin?

45
00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:29,960
When a person of authority has its finger like this it's already shit, right?

46
00:03:30,980 --> 00:03:31,880
Engin?

47
00:03:36,820 --> 00:03:39,180
Stop laying hands on weaker students!

48
00:03:41,100 --> 00:03:41,600
Please!

49
00:03:45,220 --> 00:03:47,740
And then Engin said something very clever, because he said:

50
00:03:50,380 --> 00:03:52,160
"I would also lay hands on stronger students..

51
00:03:53,580 --> 00:03:54,780
...but there are none!"

52
00:03:57,960 --> 00:04:00,940
Then he punched the guidance counselor

53
00:04:03,020 --> 00:04:04,680
That sounds harsh, but hey

54
00:04:05,460 --> 00:04:06,740
This man was used to it

55
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:09,840
This was his daily routine

56
00:04:11,460 --> 00:04:14,520
I'm not kidding: he lands in the stable side position by himself

57
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:26,140
and he is really stable, we kicked him from all sides.

58
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:31,920
This man was laying there...

59
00:04:33,980 --> 00:04:35,180
... like a number one!

60
00:04:36,680 --> 00:00:00,000
more specifically like a very retarded four towards the end.
