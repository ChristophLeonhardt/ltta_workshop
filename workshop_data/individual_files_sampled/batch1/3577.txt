my name is June bailiwick and I own a small software company but what I really love to do is modify and restore cars I've been modifying cars you know since I could walk but after recently experiencing some electric cars I thought this is totally the future and I need to learn everything I can about it I think a lot of guys are kind of nervous about electric cars you know when you've been working on v8s forever and you kind of go you know hey what about the sound what about the performance test Wanda has kind of showed them that you can still have a hell of a lot of fun and do something that's that's gonna blow everyone's mind I think because of how it looks people don't really have high expectations for how it's going to perform so when they see it and when they see a move into the distance very very quickly they're they're kind of shocked I think that the spirit of hot rodding will never go away regardless of what the power plan is you can still do an engine swap you can still keep your chassis that you love and the body design you know from the 60s or 70s or whatever you love and modernize it and make it better than it ever was I hope that by the time my son is old enough to drive I'll be wrenching with him in the garage on electrics the same way that my dad wrenched with me on my first cars you know maybe we'll take his outdated Nissan Leaf and hop up the motor and then change the inverter out maybe we'll try and get 400 kilowatts out of the motor so there's still a future in hot rodding and for me that's really important
