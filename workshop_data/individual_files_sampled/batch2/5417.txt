for more reaction to the president's unprecedented retaliation against the former CIA director I'm joined by MSNBC global affairs analyst John McLaughlin former deputy director of the CIA and former acting director of the CIA John does afternoon you were kind enough to get on the phone with me when this news first broke to talk it through now that we've had a few hours to listen to it you've heard John Brennan's own words what are your thoughts on on what happened today well you know I've thought a lot about it Ally since we had that first conversation and I can't find any way to describe this as anything other than a transparent attempt to muzzle free speech actually wet and I looked here at the 26 page executive directive that governs standards for classification for clearances and we're revoking them there were 13 reasons in there for revoking a security clearance and not one of them matches anything close to the reasons given in the White House statement I don't know that they've read this but it was signed out during president Trump's administration so he owns it so I see it as nothing less than that a vindictive way to mete out punishment for something that the president has heard and does not like and then to use that as a way to intimidate others that he considered that he says he's considering taking the same action will not achieve that goal of intimidating others the the the Sorachi standards listed a bunch of names Michael Hayden James Comey Andrew McCabe Susan Rice Sally Yates John Brennan doesn't seem to be too moved by this whole thing he's offended by it he's troubled by it but in the end as a punitive measure this is gonna backfire in the president just make him look petty and punitive that I think it's going to backfire on him and frankly if it gets into an administrative or court proceeding I'm not a lawyer but I've talked to a few since since this afternoon I don't think it would hold up I don't think it would stand there's procedure for and the president has the authority to do this but I think the gravest mistake greatest error a president can make is to deny an American citizen their rights and this president in this kind of action is not behaving like the elected president of a vibrant democracy it does have the feel of what an authoritarian tyrant does and the the white house is not very they're not very clever about this they're very transparent when you listen to what they've said they have not given a reason that matches anything in the laws of regulation commensurate with what's required to deny security clearances let's give this because Senator Mark Warner has a more sinister view of this whole thing this is what he said as it relates to today's decision and the Muller investigation let's listen together I worry whether this precedence is going to somehow lead to the president trying to take away Muller and his whole team security clearances this is clearly another effort to silence critics and not allow the Moller investigation and for that matter our Senate Intelligence Committee investigation to get to the bottom of this it's an interesting take what do you think of that John well I wouldn't rule it out you know this president has not lost the ability to astonish us every single day with something that that we wouldn't think of because it's such improper behavior for a president so I wouldn't rule that out although I think it may give them a little more credit than they deserve given that this directive was dated as someone pointed out today way back in July that's right clearly used today as a sort of a an opportunity to put it out and probably to distract from the Omarosa affair and so forth but I wouldn't rule out anything at this point from the president because I've sensed in the last week or two a kind of quickening panic on the part of the president and people around him about the way the walls are closing in and and this has the feel of an act of desperation particularly when you see how transparent it is I mean essentially it's denying mr. Brennan is his First Amendment rights I think we're not denying his First Amendment rights let me he I don't think he still has his First Amendment rights it's just punishing him for sizing them that's an important point and I think that's that's I don't see how you can put any other construction on it because there's not been a reasonable persuasive reason given by the White House for the action they've taken careful John McLaughlin that kind of talk would get you labeled erratic by the White House worse believe me good to see you sir thank you for joining me again twice today John McLaughlin hey there I'm Chris Hayes from MSNBC thanks for watching MSNBC on YouTube if you want to keep up to date with the videos we're putting out you can click subscribe just below me or click over on this list to see lots of other great videos
