space the final frontier the United States wants to patrol it Washington has announced the creation of a new armed space force by 2020 but who will be the u.s. competing against and is this the start of a new space race this is inside story hello and welcome to the program Ahmad Abdul Hamid yes vice president Mike Pence says the time has come to prepare for the next battle field and that battle field is space the Americans want to create a space force within two years to defend us satellites and spacecraft from attack it will be the first new branch of the military since 1947 Pence's boss Donald Trump wants Congress to vote yes to the plan and agree to additional funding of eight billion dollars we will get to our guest shortly but first Allen Fisher reports from Washington DC Donald Trump has been pushing for the creation of a new branch of the military for months he talks about it often that is rallies we may even have a space force now his vice president says Donald Trump's vision will become a reality while too often previous administrations all but neglected the growing security threats emerging in space president Trump's stated clearly and forcefully that space is in his words a war fighting domain just like land and air and sea the new force will be used to protect us satellites in space which provide vital services like communication it can also protect spy satellites which direct military operations and there is the growing commercial space market - it's not a new idea in 1983 President Ronald Reagan called for a space-based missile defense system just a year after Congress demanded the establishment of a new space force the defense system dubbed Star Wars by critics never got beyond the research phase the u.s. already has a Space Command as part of the Air Force and some see the new branch as an expensive waste in fact defense secretary Jim mattis initially resisted it but just earlier this week signaled he was no on board we are in complete alignment with the concerned about protecting our assets and space to contribute for security for economy from a going to have to address it as other countries show up capability to attack those aspect creating a new branch of the military needs congressional authorization and funding if Republicans lose control of the House of Representatives in November's midterm elections it might never happen former astronaut Mark Kelly says he doesn't see the point there is a threat out there but it's being handled by the US Air Force today doesn't make sense to build a whole nother level of bureaucracy the space force if approved would become the sixth branch of the u.s. military it would be led by a four-star officer and with pool resources from other military branches Russia has a space force Chinese space program is run by the military and the White House will include an eight billion dollar funding request for their new space force in the next budget Alan Fisher al Jazeera Washington let's now get the thoughts of our guest joining us in Lubbock Texas via Skype Oliver McGee an adviser to Donald Trump and former US deputy assistant secretary for transportation in Beijing in our tangen a China political analyst and in Sydney Maurice Jones a space analyst and author of when men walked on the moon a warm welcome to all of you Oliver McGee let me start with you I mean it does sound like something out of a Star Wars so what exactly is a space force and in what is it different from the current Space Command well this is a time for us to move from Reagan Star Wars which was really about ending the Cold War to Trump's space force which is about ensuring global peace world peace the space force is really like you said in your opening segment the six military agency and it's very important for securing a space it's it's about navigation practices and communications and this is all about trying to make sure that we don't have pearl harbors in space where we will have a blackout and that would basically cripple the global economy this is really about ensuring the security of global capital and global businesses which are increasingly dependent upon satellite technologies and space assets and so Madison is looking at trying to create a space command similar to what you see in the European Command the Middle East Command the African command of specific command and then make making sure that space assets are protected and that we have national security up space because in the twentieth century we're really talking about the Air Force and we're trying to essentially secure the stratosphere which is about ten to thirty kilometers and now we're we're based in the sky but now we're trying to basically go beyond that and then to move into that's ten to thirty thousand kilometres that is and now we're trying to move into space so where we can basically sure those assets are in place and then that we can make sure that we can control space and this is really more than just Star Wars it's really about you might say Starfleet and so we were really trying to make sure that we have the president's vision intact and and Pence is trying to establish the Department of space sports and on working closely with the Space Command to ensure that we started advancing Space Science and Technology which is always a very very good thing for the United States to get into because this is really all about ensuring fast capital fast technology for fast growth well Mars Jones I mean it sounds a bit like militarization of space which is quite a frightening thought and it also begs the question how do you share space who decides which country controls what well I think that you can have a stronger military presence in space and still be able to share space with other Asians the United States and most nations on earth are bound by the 1967 Outer Space Treaty are signed at the United Nations and basically that says that no nation owns space no nation claims exclusive access to space and so even if we see a greater military presence it won't mean that the United States or any other nation totally controls or dominates space it's legally prohibited and it's also physically impossible like in the sense that you cannot stop satellites from orbiting the Earth you cannot control the physical movements of objects through space in the same way that you can patrol a nation's airspace and that this has been widely recognized and one of the reasons why we have the Outer Space Treaty so I don't think that it's a case of any nation dominating space even if they're protecting their space assets ok well that said I mean the United States the United States says it has a lot of concerns some of them is China for example destroyed one of its own satellites in orbit in 2007 and is likely capable of getting rid of others too Russia is believed to be developing an airborne laser that would be able to destroy space-based systems and North Korea is believed to have used its GPS jamming capabilities against South Korea in 2010 now in our tangan that's where you come into the conversation how was this announcement a space force been received in Beijing well it's not been received very well it comes another area of competition besides the economic and political and military on the ground this is now an attempt to take it into space I'm surprised that my fellow guests have not mentioned the fact that there's a prohibits prohibit ation of militarizing space and this would be a direct conflict with that so it's it's very hard to see how these matters would be handled creating a space force is a long way from dealing with the issues that you rightly pointed out which is how do you control this who's going to dominate it is it going to simply be the us because they spend more money on military and have the means to do this or will it be shared will it be according to convention or is the u.s. going to simply ignore all conventions simply as they've done with Iran and other issues well maybe all of our Maggie could answer some of these questions well I think this is really about Science and Technology Policy we've been in this business for a long time going back to Allan Bromley into Jack Gibbons into Neil Lane and now the current science advisor this focus to science applies to the president is about advancing science and technology in space and this is where you begin to use really supreme assets of development in space technologies you're looking at Infotech biotech wireless tech micro tech nano tech conk tech even looking at elder tech because we're really looking at not only transportation as business communications but also space as economic communications and so really this is really about how does the United States be maintain its supremacy in developing kinds of technology and also science and technology policy going into tying into national security policy and economic policy this is really consistent to what the United States wants to do and it's important that the president has now named his new science advisor to be able to help coordinate their science of technology development vice president Mike Pence in his speech said very clearly the plan is to create an elite group of war fighters specializing in the domain of space a sort of Special Operations Forces but from above that does not sound like science and technology well war fighting has always been about the science the technology development the country that has the highest amount Science and Technology assets is the one that wins the war ultimately the the most science and technology that we see pervasive in this President's budget is through the Pentagon but also NASA is involved so is the Department of Transportation because I wrote the national R&D strategy plan when I was in the Clinton administration that involved looking at science and technology development at NASA FAA the Department of Defense and so these are the big chunks of the budget longer Department of Energy where science and technology is developed this is this is very good for science the technology developed in this typical educational community in the United States but also we also are interested in trying to make sure that we'd also take care of what we need to do in developing new frontiers of what we have to do national security protections and really when you're looking when you look at the United States it's about protecting its assets its military assets but also edible load of twaddle I can't believe those are going along and it's saying these no I just three I disagree absolutely incredible that should be saying this that this is about technology when you're clearly at the price president this is about warfare I have to disagree with that because I've talked about National Science and Technology Development and defending something that's defenseless okay talking about may I interject a NAR at the same time the head of the Chinese lunar exploration program compared China's space ambition to those in the South China Sea and to be fair China controls 90% of that sea or somewhere along that number so I mean that rhetoric is coming out from both countries isn't it well when when one country expands another one does too I don't think that either side is necessarily going to win this what you have in the South China Seas is a little bit different than what you have out in space South China Seas goes back if you go to there's study the history of own clothes the whole idea of creating something beyond the cannon-shot rule be hung three miles was introduced by the US but later on the u.s. declined to enter into you in close it's not a signatory to it but this caused a land grab literally in the seas in space if you want this same kind of chaos reigning creating new norms that you have based on military might rather than sitting down at the UN or some adjacent body where you can sit down and create policies about how space should be used and shared as it was pointed out in 1967 they signed a treaty things have been quiet since then yes technology has moved on but I don't think that's adding eight billion dollars to an already overburdened budget increasing than government is necessarily going to help the civilian use of technology it might be that you know it's very favorable to NASA to have an additional funding route but this is not about technology this is about warfare it's about throwing another white rabbit out into the world that people are supposed to chase around there's just nothing can be said except what the vice president said himself and that this is about creating armed warriors in space contrary to the conventions but Mars Jose you shared this idea that this space race could create chaos above our heads may I say and that maybe it's a bit too early and it says that nothing is regulated and nobody knows what can happen up there and what would be the repercussions for the rest of us down here well I think that I mean throughout this discussion we've invoked the 1967 Outer Space Treaty more than once and regardless of the provisions of the treaty it is a fact that we are steadily moving towards a weaponization of space from various nations whether we like it or not China has tested and he satellite weapons so is the United States so has Russia and this has been going on for decades so it's not as if the idea of the militarization of space just came with Donald Trump it's been progressing steadily throughout the Space Age and at some point there may be a call for regulation even if it's not that via the Outer Space Treaty through negotiations between various nations but I think that that degree of militarization will continue because everyone has space air assets every advanced military in the world uses satellites to advance its military causes and thus all of those satellites are technically military assets so it to a degree it's a definition issue how do you define a weapon in space is a spy satellite a weapon is a GPS satellite a weapon and so I think in some ways you've got to clarify those ideas as well before you can start negotiations or treaty provisions and these are all very blurry issues right now okay well somewhat married argue that this is actually at the beginning of the second space race the first one being back in the 50s and 60s at the time John F Kennedy had actually made his famous speech and talked about first man on the moon now Trump says that space is a war fighting domain just like land air and sea but 56 years ago former President John Kennedy had these words to say to convince Americans of his efforts to land man on the moon only if the United States occupies a position of preeminence can we help decide whether this new ocean will be a sea of peace or a new theraph eyeing theater of war I do not say that we should all will go unprotected against the hostile misuse of space anymore then we go unprotected against the hostile use of land or sea but I do say that space can be explored and mastered without feeding the fires of war now in our tangent you feel that this I mean those words at the time where it was different times man still had to go to space and his still had to land on the moon and to us probably more about science and technology then than it is now according to your opinion in a well look Communications is not about the satellite system anymore the satellite system is really geared toward national defense if you look at an amount of fiber that's been laid and the amount of communications it's on land or by Wi-Fi wireless it's all mostly land-based in terms of what we can learn from space in terms of biogenetics and things like that yes there's a place for that but this is not a huge resource that is that is unknown to people out there the issue here is do you want to plunge ahead by having everybody engage in militarizing space by having their own space force or do you want to sit down and try to figure out what the new reality is I agree with my my cohort who says that look this is about definitions and sitting down in defining them and coming to some sort of Accord but you cannot do that if you unilaterally say that I'm gonna have the biggest baddest space force out there you know Captain Kirk is going to be on call for me and we're gonna take us to the next level yes there are concerns John F Kennedy was talking during a time of the height of Cold War when he was looked staring down the face of issues involving Russia today we do not have that we have a highly connected economic political world the military option has not proven to be anything except a disrupter you start looking at what's happened in the Middle East and everywhere else that you had Wars it has not settled anything starting a new one out in space is simply an invitation to spend more on something that will benefit few well Oliver McGee I mean there was but eyebrows raised in the United States when this announcement came some people also said do we really need to go through this expenditure now on the many problems that have to be solved on earth before going to space many pointed out to the fact to the healthcare system for example so but this idea of a space force is this part of the make America great again doctrine yes it is the make America great again doctrine is really about economic prosperity but also it's about technological prominence when I do also agree with our colleague today that this is going to require some definitions of course but the key issue is is that do we have also abilities to be able to control what we're doing in our development of our science and technology enterprise this is really really about innovation in a prize and the magum movement is about developing the science and technology but also the innovation infrastructure within the United States and that's very very important because when we start doing the science and technology development not only on the ground in infrastructure development which is a really key investment that's necessary also but also when we start doing it beyond in the to disguise that's going to empower education in the United States more than we've seen in decades and this is really what John Kennedy was doing when he did the moonshot vision he when he decided we're gonna put a man on the moon he was really trying to teach business systems thinking which is about act acquiring and also building technologies for data information knowledge acquisition better understanding and wisdom upon world peace and also world advancement in science of technology we all benefited from the moonshot speech we're of John F Kennedy because we saw systems-thinking invoked in in business and education and in government and that seems to me wanting to heat up all the time of a discussion talking about something that has no I do not basically talk about nice National Science and Technology America Science and Technology which the question that was asked of me and I think that's an important contribution to make today not just the political this is about you know Morris you know one could argue that space has been used for military purposes since the very beginning and that it is a fully militarized but are we now go by stepping up Spectre stepping it up further are we going in unchartered territory or we're worrying too much I think that we are definitely going into new territory for space but this is not new territory in terms of strategic issues or the history of warfare I think we have to be pragmatic about this whether we like it or not there will be a greater militarization of space not just by America but by various nations they will look to put more military satellites into space to support ground operations they will also seek new ways to deny other nations the operations of their own satellites there could be physical attacks on satellites there could be attempts to hack satellites not which is known as spoofing and and that's a form of cyber warfare beyond the earth and if we go further and further into terms of developing our infrastructure in space like large space stations or space industry then those assets could become targets for attack by state actors or potentially even non-state actors and then we have a broader frontier of the fact that they could be threats from space that don't even originate from the earth things like the comets and asteroids that could threaten the earth as they did the dinosaurs and it could be the case that military space assets could be used to deflect or destroy threats to the entire earth and that given the fact that we've had several near near approaches and near misses from fairly large asteroids that is one strategic threat to the earth that can't be ignored it's certainly very frightening I'm sure now experts in China the US and other countries are probably looking at ways to speed up this space race but we have reached the end of our program so thank you everybody Oliver McGee in our tangent and Morris Jones and thank you too for watching you can see the program again anytime by visiting our website aljazeera.com and for further discussion go to our book page that's facebook-dot-com forward-slash AJ inside
