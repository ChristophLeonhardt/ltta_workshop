thank you everybody I hope you saw the ground sink us it's a question Donald Trump doesn't want to answer but sources close to Trump Michael Cohen and the campaign have all told NBC News that Cohen will definitely flip on Trump if it means saving his own hide barber res Paul Butler and Jill wine banks are back with me barber I'm gonna start with you know Donald Trump is saying that somebody is a drugged-out loser we don't know who he means but we're gonna go to a couple of the people it could be he could be talking about Roger stone Roger stone says in the New York Times that Donald Trump goes out of his way to treat Michael Cohen like garbage a quote from their four years Trump treated mr. Cohen poorly with gratuitous insults dismissive statements and at least twice threats of being fired according to interviews interviews with a half dozen people familiar with their relationship I know you're not familiar so much with Michael Cohen but does that sound like the way Donald Trump treated people in his organization absolutely his own employees but not all of them not all of us I should say but if he sensed a weakness he would just hone in on and he jump on you and if you took it that was to him the license to do what everyone it was really insulting terribly in front of other people and mean and he did threaten to fire people but he never would fire them because they were doing their jobs yeah and there's there's a statement in The New York Times article that Donald Trump is like First Avenue his loyalty only goes one way but you were talking agreement about how he demands absolute loyalty does that mean loyalty meaning willing to go to prison for Donald Trump you know I don't think that anyone ever thought in terms of that kind of loyalty although one of his security people said once that he would kill for Donald on which you know I don't think anyone would do I don't think anyone will go through to prison for Donnelly either yes never been tested yeah absolutely let's talk about the other person he could be talking about and we don't know he's talking about but Roger stone has said some untoward things about Sam Nunn Berg and the New York Times that same piece quotes this ironically says Sam Nunn Berg Michael Cohen now holds the leverage over Trump and he's a former aide to Trump who worked for mr. Cohen and for Roger stone number said that mr. Cohen shouldn't matter summize that leverage and he added whenever anyone complains to me about Trump screwing them over my reflexive response is that person has nothing to complain about compared to Michael yeah so today President Trump joined the don't be a snitch movement that sweetie said he might as well have added hashtag snitches get stitches because ask George papadopolis asked Michael Flynn and ask Carter Paige special counsel mother throws the book at you so you may not coming in come in think you're gonna cooperate but when you leave that interview you pled guilty and have told pledge to mother that you're going to tell them every dirty thing that Donald Trump ever did and Jill wine banks on me you have Donald Trump - who was point doing his no snitching campaign on Twitter tweeting most people will flip if the government lets them out of trouble even if it means lying or making up stories sorry I don't see Michael doing that despite the horrible witch hunt and the dishonest media I wonder if tweeting that at you know sort of kind of telegraphing that to Michael Cohen that I know you're not a snitch could that be seen as interfering with a witness the Donald Trump has done so many things to me that seem like interference with witnesses the pardon of Joe Arpaio the pardon of Scooter Libby are clearly intended to influence witnesses and to say I'm got your back I'll pardon you don't worry about this don't cooperate lie you can be in contempt of court I'll still pardon you so yes this is one more aspect of it but I think that Cohn has to think about he also has state crimes that he could be facing and would he rather serve his time in a federal prison or in a state prison he's going to obviously opt for the federal prison system instead of the state prison system and so we have to just see whether he will or won't he said I would take a bullet for the president which is something kordon Liddy said during Watergate and gordon Liddy lived up to it but Cohen seems much more like a thug and a bull who frequently bullies are just really weak people and will flip so we'll have to see and you know there's another feature of a person like Donald Trump who can be part bully part concierge one of the things I've heard about him is that Donald Trump will flatter and flatter and flatter in addition to bullying here is a clip from Donald Trump back in January 11th 2017 talking about Michael Cohen when at the time they thought they had the mic drop on the steel dossier because they thought that the steel dossier was wrong about Michael Cohen being improv of course we've since learned yeah he wasn't probably this was Michael this was Donald Trump back when they thought that that part of the dossier was wrong that Michael Kohn of the Trump Organization was in Prague it turned out to be a different Michael cone it's a disgrace what took place it's a disgrace and I think they ought to apologize to start with Michael cone and by the way Michael Cohen has now dropped his lawsuit against BuzzFeed infusion GPS over that very interesting steel dossier I first come to you on this Barbara if threatening or making sort of very obvious hints that you shouldn't snitch don't work it is Donald Trump the kind of person that might go to flattery buttering him up maybe offering a pardon you know I don't think in this instance he would think flattery would work flattery is for a whole other thing this is this is serious stuff so dropping those just pardoning Libby and that kind of thing that is what he's trying to do he's trying to say you'll get pardoned yeah and can Donald Trump pardon his way out of this mess he can but then he opens himself up to first another more evidence of obstruction of justice and second there's actually an open constitutional question about whether the president can use his very expansive hardened power to pardon someone who's a witness in an investigation against him I think that that actually would go up to the Supreme Court I'm not sure how they would come out at the end of the day pardon does not give Donald Trump and out and let's go to another issue Jill Michael Cohen is now in a position where we're gonna talk a little bit more about this in the next hour with Michael avenatti where he needs to file a Fifth Amendment statement he essentially needs to take the fifth in order to try to slow down the stormy Daniels lawsuit if he winds up taking v against self incrimination does that in any way inoculate him against being pulled dragged before the molar grand jury and having to talk well it's an interesting question and it's actually a third point to what Paul just said because in addition if he is pardoned he has no Fifth Amendment privilege left so he can't use that as a reason not to testify so there's a third reason why a pardon would be ineffective in protecting Donald Trump it would actually open him up to further testimony yeah and that would be a very bad thing for him and probably even your you know having dealt with them is there anyone in his life in his circle pushed Jared Kushner maybe you know Don Jr who would go to prison for him that you experienced no I I don't think so no as a matter of fact I think that he may throw them under the bus at some point in time to protect himself iearnt yeah you know it's like you said loyalty is among my strengths yeah and that being the case then where does that go for me right it seems that he is being circled in circled and circled by an ever larger pool of shot pool of sharks you know ever shallower pond I'm wondering where he goes from here so I'm thinking of Jill's worker martyr Gaiden spiral and so at some point there was so much evidence against him that there was a deal made you leave office and then we'll leave you alone that is we won't bring criminal charges against you so you know people are thought about is Trump going to run for re-election Muller's aware that that elections coming up I think everything's on the table evidence until before we go I have to ask you what your PIN is today today's pin is a world spinning out of control and a new cycle that won't stop Wow and normally you always have something for us with the fabulous pins we have something for you now let's look at this picture we go back in time that is a young gorgeous deal wine being a third game is super strong
