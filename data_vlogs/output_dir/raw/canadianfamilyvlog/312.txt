I don't know if you'll ever get to see

39
00:02:18,610 --> 00:02:20,830
the other video that I made but I was

40
00:02:20,830 --> 00:02:23,080
filming Bree out looking at the tadpoles

41
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:25,870
in the river and I dropped my brand new

42
00:02:25,870 --> 00:02:28,569
camera in the river and of course it

43
00:02:28,569 --> 00:02:30,610
shut down immediately and it went like

44
00:02:30,610 --> 00:02:33,340
in the river I got it out but I mean it

45
00:02:33,340 --> 00:02:37,720
sunk so I'm really sad right now it's

46
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:39,519
drawing out I took the battery out right

47
00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:40,989
away in the memory card<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I'm hoping</font>

48
00:02:40,989 --> 00:02:43,209
everything will be saved that way but I

49
00:02:43,209 --> 00:02:45,819
don't know I think like water got right

50
00:02:45,819 --> 00:02:47,200
into the lens<font color="#CCCCCC"> because it's not like it</font>

51
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:48,549
was closed when I dropped it I was

52
00:02:48,549 --> 00:02:50,110
recording so the water probably been

53
00:02:50,110 --> 00:02:53,980
trade-in I'm really really bummed anyway

54
00:02:53,980 --> 00:02:56,349
so by some miracle i put my other

55
00:02:56,349 --> 00:02:58,120
battery and a different memory card in

56
00:02:58,120 --> 00:03:00,069
