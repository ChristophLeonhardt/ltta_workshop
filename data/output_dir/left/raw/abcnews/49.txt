ON HIMSELF, TOO, GEORGE.

31
00:00:40,535 --> 00:00:42,370
THAT CABINET MEETING YESTERDAY 

32
00:00:42,370 --> 00:00:45,239
WAS ABSOLUTELY ASTOUNDING.

33
00:00:45,239 --> 00:00:46,273
OUR CAMERAS ALLOWED IN THE ROOM 

34
00:00:46,273 --> 00:00:47,675
FOR ESSENTIALLY THE FULL LENGTH 

35
00:00:47,675 --> 00:00:49,777
OF THIS DISCUSSION, I SHOULD 

36
00:00:49,777 --> 00:00:51,412
SAY, NOT A CABINET MEETING, BUT 

37
00:00:51,412 --> 00:00:53,414
THIS MEETING WITH DEMOCRATIC AND

38
00:00:53,414 --> 00:00:55,350
REPUBLICAN LAWMAKERS, A 

39
00:00:55,350 --> 00:00:56,450
BIPARTISAN MEETING AT THE WHITE 

40
00:00:56,450 --> 00:00:57,952
HOUSE TO TALK ABOUT IMMIGRATION.

41
00:00:57,952 --> 00:00:58,552
"THE NEW YORK TIMES" HAD THE 

42
00:00:58,552 --> 00:01:00,421
BEST LINE, THEY CALLED IT A MIX 

43
00:01:00,421 --> 00:01:01,856
BETWEEN THE WEST WING AND THE 

44
00:01:01,856 --> 00:01:02,156
APPRENTICE.

45
00:01:02,156 --> 00:01:03,291
THAT'S WHAT WE SAW.

46
00:01:03,291 --> 00:01:05,191
CAMERAS WERE ROLLING AS THIS 

47
00:01:05,191 --> 00:01:06,694
DISCUSSION ABOUT HOW TO DEAL 

48
00:01:06,694 --> 00:01:08,195
WITH IMMIGRATION REFORM IN THIS 

49
00:01:08,195 --> 00:01:09,364
COUNTRY WAS HAPPENING.

50
00:01:09,364 --> 00:01:10,731
OF COURSE, ALL OF THAT WAS 

51
00:01:10,731 --> 00:01:13,034
ALLOWED TO HAPPEN IN THE WAKE OF

52
00:01:13,034 --> 00:01:15,569
THIS BOOK THAT HAS THIS WHITE 

53
00:01:15,569 --> 00:01:15,969
HOUSE IN TURMOIL.

54
00:01:15,969 --> 00:01:17,672
THAT "FIRE AND FURY" THE 

55
00:01:17,672 --> 00:01:18,906
BOMBSHELL BEHIND THE SCENES LOOK

56
00:01:18,906 --> 00:01:20,007
AT WHAT IS HAPPENING IN THE 

57
00:01:20,007 --> 00:01:21,442
WHITE HOUSE, AND THE BIGGEST 

58
00:01:21,442 --> 00:01:22,810
ALLEGATION, AS YOU KNOW, 

59
00:01:22,810 --> 00:01:24,078
QUESTIONS ABOUT THE PRESIDENT'S 

60
00:01:24,078 --> 00:01:24,979
MENTAL FITNESS.

61
00:01:24,979 --> 00:01:26,213
I WONDER IF THE QUESTIONS WILL 

62
00:01:26,213 --> 00:01:26,747
COME UP TODAY.

63
00:01:26,747 --> 00:01:27,348
>> A QUESTION COMING IN RIGHT 

64
00:01:27,348 --> 00:01:30,852
NOW.

65
00:01:30,852 --> 00:01:32,319
>> WASHINGTON EXAMINER.

66
00:01:32,319 --> 00:01:34,822
>> THANK YOU, MR. PRESIDENT.

67
00:01:34,822 --> 00:01:36,658
YESTERDAY, IN A MEETING WITH 

68
00:01:36,658 --> 00:01:37,859
LAWMAKERS, YOU SAID YOU WOULD BE

69
00:01:37,859 --> 00:01:39,927
OPEN TO SIGNING JUST ABOUT ANY 

70
00:01:39,927 --> 00:01:41,896
IMMIGRATION DEAL THAT THAT 

71
00:01:41,896 --> 00:01:43,564
BIPARTISAN GROUP OF LAWMAKERS 

72
00:01:43,564 --> 00:01:44,365
SENT TO YOU.

73
00:01:44,365 --> 00:01:46,133
WOULD YOU BE WILLING TO SIGN AN 

74
00:01:46,133 --> 00:01:47,268
IMMIGRATION DEAL THAT ULTIMATELY

75
00:01:47,268 --> 00:01:49,170
DOES NOT INCLUDE FUNDING FOR THE

76
00:01:49,170 --> 00:01:50,104
BORDER WALL OR WOULD THAT BE A 

77
00:01:50,104 --> 00:01:50,838
RED LINE FOR YOU?

78
00:01:50,838 --> 00:01:52,407
>> NO, NO.

79
00:01:52,407 --> 00:01:52,573
NO.

80
00:01:52,573 --> 00:01:54,075
GOT TO INCLUDE THE WALL.

81
00:01:54,075 --> 00:01:55,442
WE NEED THE WALL FOR SECURITY.

82
00:01:55,442 --> 00:01:56,844
WE NEED THE WALL FOR SAFETY.

83
00:01:56,844 --> 00:01:58,078
WE NEED THE WALL FOR STOPPING 

84
00:01:58,078 --> 00:02:00,314
THE DRUGS FROM POURING IN.

85
00:02:00,314 --> 00:02:01,582
I WOULD IMAGINE THAT THE PEOPLE 

86
00:02:01,582 --> 00:02:04,185
IN THE ROOM, BOTH DEMOCRAT AND 

87
00:02:04,185 --> 00:02:05,586
REPUBLICAN, I REALLY BELIEVE 

88
00:02:05,586 --> 00:02:06,754
THEY'RE GOING TO COME UP WITH A 

89
00:02:06,754 --> 00:02:07,921
SOLUTION TO THE DACA PROBLEM, 

90
00:02:07,921 --> 00:02:09,490
WHICH HAS BEEN GOING ON FOR A 

91
00:02:09,490 --> 00:02:10,358
LONG TIME.

92
00:02:10,358 --> 00:02:11,959
AND MAYBE BEYOND THAT, 

93
00:02:11,959 --> 00:02:14,862
IMMIGRATION AS A WHOLE.

94
00:02:14,862 --> 00:02:16,297
BUT ANY SOLUTION HAS TO INCLUDE 

95
00:02:16,297 --> 00:02:17,365
THE WALL BECAUSE WITHOUT THE 

96
00:02:17,365 --> 00:02:19,033
WALL, IT ALL DOESN'T WORK.

97
00:02:19,033 --> 00:02:20,935
YOU COULD LOOK AT OTHER 

98
00:02:20,935 --> 00:02:23,704
INSTANCES, LOOK AT WHAT HAPPENED

99
00:02:23,704 --> 00:02:23,971
IN ISRAEL.

100
00:02:23,971 --> 00:02:24,806
THEY PUT UP THE WALL, THEY SAY 

101
00:02:24,806 --> 00:02:26,307
IT SOLVED A MAJOR PROBLEM.

102
00:02:26,307 --> 00:02:27,041
WE NEED THE WALL.

103
00:02:27,041 --> 00:02:28,409
WE HAVE TO HAVE THE WALL FOR 

104
00:02:28,409 --> 00:02:29,243
SECURITY PURPOSES.

105
00:02:29,243 --> 00:02:30,812
SECURITY IS NUMBER ONE.

106
00:02:30,812 --> 00:02:32,379
AND SO THE ANSWER IS HAVE TO 

107
00:02:32,379 --> 00:02:32,713
HAVE THE WALL.

108
00:02:32,713 --> 00:02:34,649
THANK YOU.

109
00:02:34,649 --> 00:02:40,254
AND PLEASE.

110
00:02:40,254 --> 00:02:44,459
>> CAN I CALL ON THE NORWEGIAN 

111
00:02:44,459 --> 00:02:44,792
BROADCASTING?

112
00:02:44,792 --> 00:02:48,396
>> MR. PRESIDENT, PRIME 

113
00:02:48,396 --> 00:02:50,431
MINISTER, RECENTLY, AN AMERICAN 

114
00:02:50,431 --> 00:02:53,201
GENERAL, ROBERT NELLER, TOLD HIS

115
00:02:53,201 --> 00:02:55,435
MARINES BASED IN NORWAY THERE'S 

116
00:02:55,435 --> 00:02:58,906
A WAR COMING.

117
00:02:58,906 --> 00:03:00,942
A BIG FIGHT.

118
00:03:00,942 --> 00:03:02,510
MR. PRESIDENT, HOW IMMINENT IS 

119
00:03:02,510 --> 00:03:03,711
THAT BIG WAR?

120
00:03:03,711 --> 00:03:05,113
AND WHERE WILL IT TAKE PLACE?

121
00:03:05,113 --> 00:03:07,047
>> WHEN YOU SAY THE BIG WAR, 

122
00:03:07,047 --> 00:03:08,049
YOU'RE SAYING WHAT?

123
00:03:08,049 --> 00:03:08,816
SAY IT?

124
00:03:08,816 --> 00:03:10,985
>> IT WAS AN AMERICAN GENERAL, 

125
00:03:10,985 --> 00:03:11,952
ROBERT NELLER.

126
00:03:11,952 --> 00:03:14,321
HE VISITED THE NORWEGIAN --

127
00:03:14,321 --> 00:03:15,056
>> RIGHT.

128
00:03:15,056 --> 00:03:18,760
>> THE AMERICAN MARINES BASED IN

129
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:18,993
NORWAY.

130
00:03:18,993 --> 00:03:21,229
HE SAID THERE IS A WAR COMING, A

131
00:03:21,229 --> 00:03:22,497
BIG ASS FIGHT.

132
00:03:22,497 --> 00:03:23,264
>> MAYBE HE KNOWS SOMETHING I 

133
00:03:23,264 --> 00:03:23,564
DON'T KNOW.

134
00:03:23,564 --> 00:03:26,400
OKAY.

135
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:27,635
I WOULD SAY THIS.

136
00:03:27,635 --> 00:03:29,370
>> THERE IS NO WAR COMING?

137
00:03:29,370 --> 00:03:30,738
>> WE HAVE A VERY POWERFUL 

138
00:03:30,738 --> 00:03:31,038
MILITARY.

139
00:03:31,038 --> 00:03:32,773
WE'RE GETTING MORE POWERFUL BY 

140
00:03:32,773 --> 00:03:34,942
THE MONTH, BY THE DAY.

141
00:03:34,942 --> 00:03:36,744
WE'RE ORDERING A LOT OF 

142
00:03:36,744 --> 00:03:39,413
EQUIPMENT, YOU'RE ORDERING, 

143
00:03:39,413 --> 00:03:41,115
WE'RE ORDERING IT IN LARGER 

144
00:03:41,115 --> 00:03:43,284
AMOUNTS TO PUT IT UP MILDLY.

145
00:03:43,284 --> 00:03:44,552
WE'RE BUILDING UP OUR MILITARY 

146
00:03:44,552 --> 00:03:46,687
TO A POINT WE HAVE NEVER BEEN 

147
00:03:46,687 --> 00:03:47,088
BEFORE.

148
00:03:47,088 --> 00:03:48,956
WE'RE VERY MUCH WEAKENED OVER 

149
00:03:48,956 --> 00:03:50,925
THE LAST LONG PERIOD OF TIME.

150
00:03:50,925 --> 00:03:52,260
BUT NOT WITH ME.

151
00:03:52,260 --> 00:03:53,694
NO, I DON'T EXPECT THAT.

152
00:03:53,694 --> 00:03:56,197
I THINK WE'RE GOING TO HAVE -- 

153
00:03:56,197 --> 00:03:58,098
BECAUSE OF STRENGTH, PEACE 

154
00:03:58,098 --> 00:03:58,699
THROUGH STRENGTH.

155
00:03:58,699 --> 00:04:00,100
I THINK WE'RE GOING TO HAVE A 

156
00:04:00,100 --> 00:04:01,435
LONG PERIOD OF PEACE.

157
00:04:01,435 --> 00:04:02,370
I HOPE WE DO.

158
00:04:02,370 --> 00:04:04,104
WE HAVE CERTAINLY PROBLEMS WITH 

159
00:04:04,104 --> 00:04:05,506
NORTH KOREA, BUT A LOT OF GOOD 

160
00:04:05,506 --> 00:04:06,774
TALKS ARE GOING ON RIGHT NOW.

161
00:04:06,774 --> 00:04:09,476
A LOT OF GOOD ENERGY.

162
00:04:09,476 --> 00:04:10,511
I SEE A LOT OF GOOD ENERGY.

163
00:04:10,511 --> 00:04:12,380
I LIKE IT VERY MUCH, WHAT I'M 

164
00:04:12,380 --> 00:04:12,613
SEEING.

165
00:04:12,613 --> 00:04:13,781
I SPOKE THIS MORNING WITH, AS 

166
00:04:13,781 --> 00:04:15,383
YOU KNOW, THE PRESIDENT.

167
00:04:15,383 --> 00:04:17,485
PRESIDENT MOON, OF SOUTH KOREA.

168
00:04:17,485 --> 00:04:19,553
HE HAD SOME REALLY GREAT 

169
00:04:19,553 --> 00:04:19,954
MEETINGS.

170
00:04:19,954 --> 00:04:21,389
HIS REPRESENTATIVES HAD A GREAT,

171
00:04:21,389 --> 00:04:22,657
GREAT MEETING.

172
00:04:22,657 --> 00:04:24,425
AND I HAD SOME VERY GOOD 

173
00:04:24,425 --> 00:04:25,359
FEEDBACK FROM THAT.

174
00:04:25,359 --> 00:04:26,494
HOPEFULLY, A LOT OF GOOD THINGS 

175
00:04:26,494 --> 00:04:27,595
ARE GOING TO WORK OUT.

176
00:04:27,595 --> 00:04:29,997
I THINK THAT WE WILL HAVE PEACE 

177
00:04:29,997 --> 00:04:30,530
THROUGH STRENGTH.

178
00:04:30,530 --> 00:04:32,133
OUR MILITARY WILL BE STRONGER 

179
00:04:32,133 --> 00:04:34,068
THAN IT EVER WAS IN A VERY SHORT

180
00:04:34,068 --> 00:04:36,737
PERIOD OF TIME, AND THAT'S MY 

181
00:04:36,737 --> 00:04:37,004
OPINION.

182
00:04:37,004 --> 00:04:38,906
THAT'S NOT THE GENERAL'S 

183
00:04:38,906 --> 00:04:39,139
OPINION.

184
00:04:39,139 --> 00:04:40,073
BUT I THINK MY OPINION COUNTS 

185
00:04:40,073 --> 00:04:40,975
MORE RIGHT NOW.

186
00:04:40,975 --> 00:04:43,644
THANK YOU.

187
00:04:43,644 --> 00:04:45,112
>> MAYBE I COULD JUST ADD THAT 

188
00:04:45,112 --> 00:04:47,348
THE REASON WHY WE ARE SO HAPPY 

189
00:04:47,348 --> 00:04:49,216
WE HAVE YOU AS MARINES TRAINING 

190
00:04:49,216 --> 00:04:52,152
IN NORWAY IS THAT'S PART OF THE 

191
00:04:52,152 --> 00:04:53,354
DETERRENCE STRATEGY TO MAKE SURE

192
00:04:53,354 --> 00:04:54,622
WE DON'T HAVE A WAR IN THE 

193
00:04:54,622 --> 00:04:55,223
FUTURE.

194
00:04:55,223 --> 00:04:57,491
>> YES, SARAH, DID YOU HAVE A 

195
00:04:57,491 --> 00:04:57,758
QUESTION?

196
00:04:57,758 --> 00:04:59,493
DID YOU HAVE A QUESTION FOR THE 

197
00:04:59,493 --> 00:05:00,194
PRIME MINISTER.

198
00:05:00,194 --> 00:05:01,195
>> I DID, YES.

199
00:05:01,195 --> 00:05:03,865
THANK YOU.

200
00:05:03,865 --> 00:05:04,565
MADAM PRIME MINISTER.

201
00:05:04,565 --> 00:05:05,332
PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS SAID THE 

202
00:05:05,332 --> 00:05:06,333
INVESTIGATION INTO RUSSIAN 

203
00:05:06,333 --> 00:05:07,802
COLLUSION MAKES OUR COUNTRY, 

204
00:05:07,802 --> 00:05:08,669
QUOTE, LOOK VERY BAD.

205
00:05:08,669 --> 00:05:10,471
AND HE SAID THIS MORNING THAT, 

206
00:05:10,471 --> 00:05:12,573
QUOTE, THE WORLD IS LAUGHING AT 

207
00:05:12,573 --> 00:05:13,474
OUR STUPIDITY.

208
00:05:13,474 --> 00:05:15,175
SO MY QUESTION TO YOU IS, ARE 

209
00:05:15,175 --> 00:05:18,579
YOU LAUGHING AT THE RUSSIAN 

210
00:05:18,579 --> 00:05:18,912
INVESTIGATION?

211
00:05:18,912 --> 00:05:21,749
>> I THINK -- I THINK THAT IT'S 

212
00:05:21,749 --> 00:05:24,151
UP TO EVERY POLITICAL SYSTEM AND

213
00:05:24,151 --> 00:05:25,619
COUNTRY TO SCRUTINIZE AND 

214
00:05:25,619 --> 00:05:26,921
DISCUSS THEIR OWN POLITICAL 

215
00:05:26,921 --> 00:05:28,623
AGENDA IN THEIR COUNTRIES.

216
00:05:28,623 --> 00:05:29,891
I RESPECT THAT VERY MUCH.

217
00:05:29,891 --> 00:05:32,293
AND THIS IS AN ISSUE FOR 

218
00:05:32,293 --> 00:05:33,361
AMERICAN POLITICS.

219
00:05:33,361 --> 00:05:35,196
I WOULD JUST LIKE TO SAY IT HAS 

220
00:05:35,196 --> 00:05:37,632
IMPACTED ALSO IN EUROPE.

221
00:05:37,632 --> 00:05:38,266
I THINK ALL EUROPEAN COUNTRIES 

222
00:05:38,266 --> 00:05:39,967
WHO HAVE HAD ELECTIONS THIS YEAR

223
00:05:39,967 --> 00:05:41,769
HAVE BEEN LOOKING INTO WILL 

224
00:05:41,769 --> 00:05:44,171
THERE BE ANY TYPE OF TAMPERING.

225
00:05:44,171 --> 00:05:47,341
WE CONCLUDED AFTEROUR ELECTION 

226
00:05:47,341 --> 00:05:47,975
WE COULD NOT FIND ANY PROOF OF 

227
00:05:47,975 --> 00:05:51,078
ANY TRYING TO PUT AN EMPHASIS ON

228
00:05:51,078 --> 00:05:53,147
THAT FROM COUNTRIES OUTSIDE 

229
00:05:53,147 --> 00:05:54,015
NORWAY.

230
00:05:54,015 --> 00:05:56,884
I THINK IT WAS VERY NORWEGIAN 

231
00:05:56,884 --> 00:05:58,352
ELECTION WITH NORWEGIAN 

232
00:05:58,352 --> 00:05:58,685
PARTICIPANTS.

233
00:05:58,685 --> 00:06:00,421
>> I WILL SAY THIS.

234
00:06:00,421 --> 00:06:01,455
THERE IS COLLUSION.

235
00:06:01,455 --> 00:06:03,190
BUT IT'S REALLY WITH THE 

236
00:06:03,190 --> 00:06:04,391
DEMOCRATS AND THE RUSSIANS.

237
00:06:04,391 --> 00:06:06,460
FAR MORE THAN IT IS WITH THE 

238
00:06:06,460 --> 00:06:07,962
REPUBLICANS AND THE RUSSIANS.

239
00:06:07,962 --> 00:06:09,964
SO THE WITCH HUNT CONTINUES.

240
00:06:09,964 --> 00:06:17,571
JOHN, GO AHEAD.

241
00:06:17,571 --> 00:06:18,839
>> THANK YOU, MR. PRESIDENT.

242
00:06:18,839 --> 00:06:19,907
I ALSO HAVE A QUESTION FOR THE 

243
00:06:19,907 --> 00:06:22,443
PRIME MINISTER, BUT IF I COULD 

244
00:06:22,443 --> 00:06:25,880
ADDRESS THE PRESIDENT FIRST.

245
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:26,480
SARAH BROUGHT UP THE RUSSIAN 

246
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:26,814
INVESTIGATION.

247
00:06:26,814 --> 00:06:27,481
YOUR LEGAL TEAM, SOURCES HAVE 

248
00:06:27,481 --> 00:06:28,983
TOLD US, BELIEVES THAT IN THE 

249
00:06:28,983 --> 00:06:31,052
NEXT FEW WEEKS, THE SPECIAL 

250
00:06:31,052 --> 00:06:32,453
COUNSEL, ROBERT MUELLER, WILL 

251
00:06:32,453 --> 00:06:33,721
ASK FOR SOME SORT OF INTERVIEW 

252
00:06:33,721 --> 00:06:34,288
WITH YOU.

253
00:06:34,288 --> 00:06:35,856
YOUR LEGAL TEAM BELIEVES AS PART

254
00:06:35,856 --> 00:06:37,558
OF WRAPPING UP HIS 

255
00:06:37,558 --> 00:06:37,891
INVESTIGATION.

256
00:06:37,891 --> 00:06:39,894
ARE YOU OPEN TO MEETING WITH 

257
00:06:39,894 --> 00:06:40,060
HIM?

258
00:06:40,060 --> 00:06:42,162
WOULD YOU BE WILLING TO MEET 

259
00:06:42,162 --> 00:06:45,165
WITH HIM WITHOUT CONDITION OR 

260
00:06:45,165 --> 00:06:46,233
WOULD YOU DEMAND THAT A STRICT 

261
00:06:46,233 --> 00:06:48,135
SET OF PARAMETERS BE PLACED 

262
00:06:48,135 --> 00:06:49,704
AROUND ANY ENCOUNTER BETWEEN YOU

263
00:06:49,704 --> 00:06:50,905
AND THE SPECIAL COUNSEL?

264
00:06:50,905 --> 00:06:52,973
>> AGAIN, JOHN, THERE HAS BEEN 

265
00:06:52,973 --> 00:06:55,476
NO COLLUSION BETWEEN THE TRUMP 

266
00:06:55,476 --> 00:06:57,043
CAMPAIGN AND RUSSIANS OR TRUMP 

267
00:06:57,043 --> 00:06:58,646
AND RUSSIANS.

268
00:06:58,646 --> 00:06:59,814
NO COLLUSION.

269
00:06:59,814 --> 00:07:00,781
WHEN I WATCH YOU INTERVIEWING 

270
00:07:00,781 --> 00:07:02,216
ALL THE PEOPLE LEAVING THEIR 

271
00:07:02,216 --> 00:07:03,250
COMMITTEES, I MEAN, THE 

272
00:07:03,250 --> 00:07:04,085
DEMOCRATS ARE RUNNING FOR 

273
00:07:04,085 --> 00:07:05,386
OFFICE, AND THEY'RE TRYING TO 

274
00:07:05,386 --> 00:07:07,188
SAY THIS, BUT THE BOTTOM LINE, 

275
00:07:07,188 --> 00:07:08,723
THEY ALL SAY THERE'S NO 

276
00:07:08,723 --> 00:07:08,990
COLLUSION.

277
00:07:08,990 --> 00:07:11,291
THERE IS NO COLLUSION.

278
00:07:11,291 --> 00:07:12,826
WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT INTERVIEWS, 

279
00:07:12,826 --> 00:07:13,827
HILLARY CLINTON HAD AN INTERVIEW

280
00:07:13,827 --> 00:07:15,596
WHERE SHE WASN'T SWORN IN.

281
00:07:15,596 --> 00:07:17,565
SHE WASN'T GIVEN THE OATH.

282
00:07:17,565 --> 00:07:19,066
THEY DIDN'T TAKE NOTES.

283
00:07:19,066 --> 00:07:20,601
THEY DIDN'T RECORD.

284
00:07:20,601 --> 00:07:24,538
AND IT WAS DONE ON THE 4th OF 

285
00:07:24,538 --> 00:07:26,207
JULY WEEKEND.

286
00:07:26,207 --> 00:07:27,408
THAT'S PERHAPS RIDICULOUS.

287
00:07:27,408 --> 00:07:29,543
A LOT OF PEOPLE LOOKED UPON THAT

288
00:07:29,543 --> 00:07:31,812
AS BEING A VERY SERIOUS BREACH 

289
00:07:31,812 --> 00:07:33,447
AND IT REALLY WAS.

290
00:07:33,447 --> 00:07:35,249
BUT AGAIN, I'LL SPEAK TO 

291
00:07:35,249 --> 00:07:35,516
ATTORNEYS.

292
00:07:35,516 --> 00:07:36,717
I CAN ONLY SAY THIS.

293
00:07:36,717 --> 00:07:38,352
THERE WAS ABSOLUTELY NO 

294
00:07:38,352 --> 00:07:38,886
COLLUSION.

295
00:07:38,886 --> 00:07:40,187
EVERYBODY KNOWS IT.

296
00:07:40,187 --> 00:07:40,554
EVERY COMMITTEE.

297
00:07:40,554 --> 00:07:42,890
I HAVE BEEN IN OFFICE NOW FOR 11

298
00:07:42,890 --> 00:07:43,123
MONTHS.

299
00:07:43,123 --> 00:07:45,793
FOR 11 MONTHS, THEY HAVE HAD 

300
00:07:45,793 --> 00:07:47,961
THIS PHONY CLOUD OVER THIS 

301
00:07:47,961 --> 00:07:48,495
ADMINISTRATION, OVER OUR 

302
00:07:48,495 --> 00:07:48,795
GOVERNMENT.

303
00:07:48,795 --> 00:07:50,231
AND IT HAS HURT OUR GOVERNMENT.

304
00:07:50,231 --> 00:07:52,400
IT DOES HURT OUR GOVERNMENT.

305
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:54,735
IT'S A DEMOCRAT HOAX THAT WAS 

306
00:07:54,735 --> 00:07:57,271
BROUGHT UP AS AN EXCUSE FOR 

307
00:07:57,271 --> 00:07:58,739
LOSING AN ELECTION THAT FRANKLY 

308
00:07:58,739 --> 00:08:00,307
THE DEMOCRATS SHOULD HAVE WON 

309
00:08:00,307 --> 00:08:01,809
BECAUSE THEY HAVE SUCH A 

310
00:08:01,809 --> 00:08:03,110
TREMENDOUS ADVANTAGE IN THE 

311
00:08:03,110 --> 00:08:03,644
ELECTORAL COLLEGE.

312
00:08:03,644 --> 00:08:05,012
IT WAS BROUGHT UP FOR THAT 

313
00:08:05,012 --> 00:08:05,413
REASON.

314
00:08:05,413 --> 00:08:06,580
BUT IT HAS BEEN DETERMINED THAT 

315
00:08:06,580 --> 00:08:09,650
THERE IS NO COLLUSION, AND BY 

316
00:08:09,650 --> 00:08:10,251
VIRTUALLY EVERYBODY.

317
00:08:10,251 --> 00:08:12,820
SO WE'LL SEE WHAT HAPPENS.

318
00:08:12,820 --> 00:08:14,455
>> WOULD YOU BE OPEN?

319
00:08:14,455 --> 00:08:16,557
>> WE'LL SEE WHAT HAPPENS.

320
00:08:16,557 --> 00:08:17,958
BUT WHEN THEY HAVE NO COLLUSION 

321
00:08:17,958 --> 00:08:19,193
AND NOBODY HAS FOUND ANY 

322
00:08:19,193 --> 00:08:21,529
COLLUSION AT ANY LEVEL, IT SEEMS

323
00:08:21,529 --> 00:08:22,963
UNLIKELY THAT YOU WOULD EVEN 

324
00:08:22,963 --> 00:08:24,832
HAVE AN INTERVIEW.

325
00:08:24,832 --> 00:08:27,268
>> MADAM PRIME MINISTER, NORWAY 

326
00:08:27,268 --> 00:08:29,369
SHARES A SMALL BUT STRATEGIC 

327
00:08:29,369 --> 00:08:30,604
BORDER WITH RUSSIA.

328
00:08:30,604 --> 00:08:31,738
PRESIDENT TRUMP'S POSITION HAS 

329
00:08:31,738 --> 00:08:33,941
BEEN IT'S BETTER TO TRY TO WORK 

330
00:08:33,941 --> 00:08:35,375
WITH VLADIMIR PUTIN IF POSSIBLE 

331
00:08:35,375 --> 00:08:37,044
THAN TO WORK AGAINST HIM.

332
00:08:37,044 --> 00:08:39,113
WHERE DO YOU COME DOWN ON THAT 

333
00:08:39,113 --> 00:08:39,447
IDEA?

334
00:08:39,447 --> 00:08:42,082
BETTER TO WORK WITH PUTIN THAN 

335
00:08:42,082 --> 00:08:42,850
TO NOT WORK WITH HIM.

336
00:08:42,850 --> 00:08:45,819
>> I THINK RUSSIA IS AN 

337
00:08:45,819 --> 00:08:46,286
IMPORTANT PLAYER IN 

338
00:08:46,286 --> 00:08:47,188
INTERNATIONAL WORLD, AND I DON'T

339
00:08:47,188 --> 00:08:49,022
THINK YOU CAN NOT WORK WITH AND 

340
00:08:49,022 --> 00:08:49,423
TALK TO.

341
00:08:49,423 --> 00:08:50,824
BUT ON THE OTHER HAND, IT'S 

342
00:08:50,824 --> 00:08:52,960
IMPORTANT TO SAY THAT WE HAVE A 

343
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:54,862
LINE WITH ALL THE SANCTIONS, AS 

344
00:08:54,862 --> 00:08:56,864
THE EUROPEAN UNION HAS DONE AND 

345
00:08:56,864 --> 00:09:00,033
AS A MEMBER CONNECTED BY NATO 

346
00:09:00,033 --> 00:09:02,035
AND INTERCONNECTED TO THAT, WE 

347
00:09:02,035 --> 00:09:06,607
HAVE ALSO SUFFERED SOME ECONOMIC

348
00:09:06,607 --> 00:09:08,108
DIFFICULTIES IN SOME AREAS IN 

349
00:09:08,108 --> 00:09:10,544
NORWAY BASED ON THOSE SANCTIONS.

350
00:09:10,544 --> 00:09:13,247
BUT ON THE OTHER HAND, WE HAVE A

351
00:09:13,247 --> 00:09:15,048
VERY GOOD RELATIONSHIP WITH 

352
00:09:15,048 --> 00:09:17,284
RUSSIA OVER THAT BORDER AREA.

353
00:09:17,284 --> 00:09:19,887
WHERE WE DO HAVE VERY MUCH FREE 

354
00:09:19,887 --> 00:09:21,455
MOVEMENT OF PEOPLE.

355
00:09:21,455 --> 00:09:24,058
ESPECIALLY PEOPLE MOVING TO AND 

356
00:09:24,058 --> 00:09:24,825
FROM.

357
00:09:24,825 --> 00:09:26,660
WE HAVE VERY LARGE CORPORATION 

358
00:09:26,660 --> 00:09:28,496
ON SUSTAINABLE FISHERIES IN THIS

359
00:09:28,496 --> 00:09:28,796
AREA.

360
00:09:28,796 --> 00:09:31,599
THE BIGGEST COD AREA IN THE 

361
00:09:31,599 --> 00:09:32,032
WORLD.

362
00:09:32,032 --> 00:09:33,334
A SUSTAINABLE RESOURCE.

363
00:09:33,334 --> 00:09:34,969
WE DO PATROL IT, WE DO WORK 

364
00:09:34,969 --> 00:09:35,236
TOGETHER.

365
00:09:35,236 --> 00:09:36,503
WE THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO DO 

366
00:09:36,503 --> 00:09:38,472
TWO THINGS AT THE SAME TIME.

367
00:09:38,472 --> 00:09:40,341
YES, THE INTERNATIONAL LAW IS 

368
00:09:40,341 --> 00:09:40,608
CLEAR.

369
00:09:40,608 --> 00:09:42,209
THERE WAS A BREAK OF THAT 

370
00:09:42,209 --> 00:09:43,944
THROUGH THE ANNEXATION OF CRIMEA

371
00:09:43,944 --> 00:09:45,445
AND THE SITUATION IN UKRAINE, 

372
00:09:45,445 --> 00:09:47,114
AND WE DO STAND BY ALL OF OUR 

373
00:09:47,114 --> 00:09:49,016
ALLIES WITH THAT.

374
00:09:49,016 --> 00:09:50,217
BUT AT THE SAME TIME, AS A 

375
00:09:50,217 --> 00:09:52,686
NEIGHBORING COUNTRY, WE DO 

376
00:09:52,686 --> 00:09:53,486
DAY-TO-DAY WORK ON THINGS WE 

377
00:09:53,486 --> 00:09:54,621
HAVE TO SOLVE FOR THE PROBLEM 

378
00:09:54,621 --> 00:09:55,722
AND THE ECONOMIC ACTIVITY THAT 

379
00:09:55,722 --> 00:09:57,591
IS IN THAT AREA.

380
00:09:57,591 --> 00:09:58,725
AND WHICH IS A FRAGILE AREA FOR 

381
00:09:58,725 --> 00:10:01,061
THE WHOLE WORLD.

382
00:10:01,061 --> 00:10:02,897
>> JUST TO ADD TO THE ANSWER.

383
00:10:02,897 --> 00:10:04,197
I THINK IT IS MUCH BETTER TO 

384
00:10:04,197 --> 00:10:06,367
WORK WITH RUSSIA.

385
00:10:06,367 --> 00:10:07,901
IT'S VERY MUCH BETTER HAVING TO 

386
00:10:07,901 --> 00:10:10,137
DO WITH NORTH KOREA WHERE WE 

387
00:10:10,137 --> 00:10:10,971
CURRENTLY HAVE A PROBLEM THAT 

388
00:10:10,971 --> 00:10:11,972
SHOULD HAVE NEVER BEEN MY 

389
00:10:11,972 --> 00:10:12,205
PROBLEM.

390
00:10:12,205 --> 00:10:13,440
THIS SHOULD HAVE BEEN A PROBLEM 

391
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:15,842
SOLVED MANY YEARS AGO WHEN IT 

392
00:10:15,842 --> 00:10:17,745
WAS MUCH LESS DANGEROUS, BUT IT 

393
00:10:17,745 --> 00:10:19,280
WAS GIVEN TO ME ALONG WITH A BIG

394
00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:20,147
MESS OF OTHER THINGS.

395
00:10:20,147 --> 00:10:22,016
I WILL SAY THIS.

396
00:10:22,016 --> 00:10:24,284
I AM FOR MASSIVE OIL AND GAS, 

397
00:10:24,284 --> 00:10:25,186
AND EVERYTHING ELSE.

398
00:10:25,186 --> 00:10:27,221
AND A LOT OF ENERGY.

399
00:10:27,221 --> 00:10:28,856
PUTIN CAN'T LOVE THAT.

400
00:10:28,856 --> 00:10:30,924
I AM FOR THE STRONGEST MILITARY 

401
00:10:30,924 --> 00:10:31,758
THAT THE UNITED STATES EVER HAD.

402
00:10:31,758 --> 00:10:34,795
PUTIN CAN'T LOVE THAT.

403
00:10:34,795 --> 00:10:36,697
BUT HILLARY WAS NOT FOR A STRONG

404
00:10:36,697 --> 00:10:39,400
MILITARY, AND HILLARY, MY 

405
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:41,001
OPPONENT, WAS FOR WINDMILLS.

406
00:10:41,001 --> 00:10:42,970
AND SHE WAS FOR OTHER TYPES OF 

407
00:10:42,970 --> 00:10:45,806
ENERGY THAT DON'T HAVE THE SAME 

408
00:10:45,806 --> 00:10:47,508
CAPACITIES AT THIS MOMENT, 

409
00:10:47,508 --> 00:10:47,775
CERTAINLY.

410
00:10:47,775 --> 00:10:49,510
SO I JUST WANT TO SAY THAT IT'S 

411
00:10:49,510 --> 00:10:51,679
A LOT BETTER TO WORK WITH OTHER 

412
00:10:51,679 --> 00:10:52,146
COUNTRIES.

413
00:10:52,146 --> 00:10:53,681
WE'RE WORKING WITH CHINA ON 

414
00:10:53,681 --> 00:10:54,014
NORTH KOREA.

415
00:10:54,014 --> 00:10:55,783
WE'RE WORKING WITH VARIOUS OTHER

416
00:10:55,783 --> 00:10:56,883
COUNTRIES, AND I THINK WE'RE 

417
00:10:56,883 --> 00:10:57,551
DOING VERY WELL.

418
00:10:57,551 --> 00:10:58,785
WE HAD A GREAT TALK.

419
00:10:58,785 --> 00:11:00,588
AS YOU KNOW, AND AS YOU 

420
00:11:00,588 --> 00:11:01,989
REPORTED, WE HAD A GREAT TALK 

421
00:11:01,989 --> 00:11:03,290
THIS MORNING WITH PRESIDENT 

422
00:11:03,290 --> 00:11:03,591
MOON.

423
00:11:03,591 --> 00:11:05,626
AND I THINK THAT A LOT OF GOOD 

424
00:11:05,626 --> 00:11:07,194
THINGS ARE HAPPENING.

425
00:11:07,194 --> 00:11:09,129
WE'RE GOING TO SEE WHAT HAPPENS.

426
00:11:09,129 --> 00:11:10,231
BUT WORKING WITH OTHER 

427
00:11:10,231 --> 00:11:11,665
COUNTRIES, WHETHER IT'S RUSSIA 

428
00:11:11,665 --> 00:11:15,469
OR CHINA OR INDIA OR ANY OF THE 

429
00:11:15,469 --> 00:11:17,037
COUNTRIES THAT SURROUND THIS 

430
00:11:17,037 --> 00:11:18,539
WORLD AND ENCOMPASS THIS WORLD, 

431
00:11:18,539 --> 00:11:19,573
THAT'S A GOOD THING, JOHN.

432
00:11:19,573 --> 00:11:20,841
THAT'S NOT A BAD THING.

433
00:11:20,841 --> 00:11:21,641
THAT'S A VERY GOOD THING.

434
00:11:21,641 --> 00:11:26,280
OKAY, GO AHEAD.

435
00:11:26,280 --> 00:11:26,780
>> MR. PRESIDENT, PRIME 

436
00:11:26,780 --> 00:11:29,550
MINISTER.

437
00:11:29,550 --> 00:11:32,219
NORWAY STRONGLY SUPPORTS THE 

438
00:11:32,219 --> 00:11:33,954
PARIS AGREEMENT AND HAS 

439
00:11:33,954 --> 00:11:35,455
EXPRESSED REGRET THAT YOU HAVE 

440
00:11:35,455 --> 00:11:38,125
DECIDED TO LEAVE IT.

441
00:11:38,125 --> 00:11:40,794
WHAT COULD PERSUADE YOU TO 

442
00:11:40,794 --> 00:11:41,027
REMAIN?

443
00:11:41,027 --> 00:11:42,596
AND WHAT KIND OF COMMON GROUND 

444
00:11:42,596 --> 00:11:43,730
DID YOU FIND IN YOUR TALKS TODAY

445
00:11:43,730 --> 00:11:45,866
ON THIS TOPIC?

446
00:11:45,866 --> 00:11:47,968
>> WELL, IT WASN'T A MAJOR 

447
00:11:47,968 --> 00:11:48,869
TOPIC, I MUST TELL YOU.

448
00:11:48,869 --> 00:11:50,704
WE TALKED ABOUT OTHER THINGS, 

449
00:11:50,704 --> 00:11:52,606
INCLUDING MOSTLY TRADE.

450
00:11:52,606 --> 00:11:55,442
BUT I WILL SAY THAT THE PARIS 

451
00:11:55,442 --> 00:11:57,544
AGREEMENT AS DRAWN AND AS WE 

452
00:11:57,544 --> 00:12:00,147
SIGNED WAS VERY UNFAIR TO THE 

453
00:12:00,147 --> 00:12:00,547
UNITED STATES.

454
00:12:00,547 --> 00:12:02,816
IT PUT GREAT PENALTIES ON US.

455
00:12:02,816 --> 00:12:04,985
IT MADE IT VERY DIFFICULT FOR US

456
00:12:04,985 --> 00:12:06,754
TO DEAL IN TERMS OF BUSINESS.

457
00:12:06,754 --> 00:12:09,857
IT TOOK AWAY A LOT OF OUR ASSET 

458
00:12:09,857 --> 00:12:10,224
VALUES.

459
00:12:10,224 --> 00:12:13,360
WE ARE A COUNTRY RICH IN GAS AND

460
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:14,795
COAL AND OIL AND LOTS OF OTHER 

461
00:12:14,795 --> 00:12:16,229
THINGS, AND THERE WAS A 

462
00:12:16,229 --> 00:12:18,032
TREMENDOUS PENALTY FOR USING IT.

463
00:12:18,032 --> 00:12:19,800
IT HURT OUR BUSINESSES.

464
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:22,303
ACCORDING TO SOME ESTIMATES, WE 

465
00:12:22,303 --> 00:12:22,836
WOULD HAVE HAD TO CLOSE 

466
00:12:22,836 --> 00:12:24,037
BUSINESSES IN ORDER TO QUALIFY 

467
00:12:24,037 --> 00:12:26,140
BY 2025.

468
00:12:26,140 --> 00:12:28,409
WHEREAS AS AN EXAMPLE, CHINA, BY

469
00:12:28,409 --> 00:12:30,878
2030, THEY DON'T KICK IN UNTIL 

470
00:12:30,878 --> 00:12:31,312
2030.

471
00:12:31,312 --> 00:12:33,413
RUSSIA, SOMEPLACE IN THE MID 

472
00:12:33,413 --> 00:12:35,316
1990s, THAT WAS THEIR STANDARD.

473
00:12:35,316 --> 00:12:36,616
THAT WAS NEVER A GOOD STANDARD 

474
00:12:36,616 --> 00:12:39,486
BECAUSE THAT WAS A DIRTY 

475
00:12:39,486 --> 00:12:42,022
STANDARD FOR THE ENVIRONMENT.

476
00:12:42,022 --> 00:12:42,856
IT TREATED THE UNITED STATES 

477
00:12:42,856 --> 00:12:45,459
VERY UNFAIRLY, AND FRANKLY, IT'S

478
00:12:45,459 --> 00:12:47,094
AN AGREEMENT THAT I HAVE NO 

479
00:12:47,094 --> 00:12:48,495
PROBLEM WITH, BUT I HAD A 

480
00:12:48,495 --> 00:12:50,096
PROBLEM WITH THE AGREEMENT THEY 

481
00:12:50,096 --> 00:12:51,765
SIGNED BECAUSE AS USUAL, THEY 

482
00:12:51,765 --> 00:12:52,700
MADE A BAD DEAL.

483
00:12:52,700 --> 00:12:54,368
SO WE COULD CONCEIVABLY GO BACK 

484
00:12:54,368 --> 00:12:55,536
IN, BUT I SAY THIS.

485
00:12:55,536 --> 00:12:56,904
WE'RE VERY STRONG ON THE 

486
00:12:56,904 --> 00:12:57,204
ENVIRONMENT.

487
00:12:57,204 --> 00:12:59,506
I FEEL VERY STRONGLY ABOUT THE 

488
00:12:59,506 --> 00:12:59,807
ENVIRONMENT.

489
00:12:59,807 --> 00:13:01,942
OUR EPA AND OUR EPA 

490
00:13:01,942 --> 00:13:04,511
COMMISSIONERS ARE VERY, VERY 

491
00:13:04,511 --> 00:13:06,546
POWERFUL IN THE SENSE THAT THEY 

492
00:13:06,546 --> 00:13:09,750
WANT TO HAVE CLEAN WATER, CLEAN 

493
00:13:09,750 --> 00:13:11,318
AIR, BUT WE ALSO WANT BUSINESSES

494
00:13:11,318 --> 00:13:13,253
THAT CAN COMPETE.

495
00:13:13,253 --> 00:13:14,688
AND THE PARIS ACCORD REALLY 

496
00:13:14,688 --> 00:13:17,224
WOULD HAVE TAKEN AWAY OUR 

497
00:13:17,224 --> 00:13:17,624
COMPETITIVE EDGE.

498
00:13:17,624 --> 00:13:20,094
WE'RE NOT GOING TO LET THAT 

499
00:13:20,094 --> 00:13:20,327
HAPPEN.

500
00:13:20,327 --> 00:13:22,229
I'M NOT GOING TO LET IT HAPPEN.

501
00:13:22,229 --> 00:13:24,498
>> THERE ARE BUSINESS 

502
00:13:24,498 --> 00:13:27,501
OPPORTUNITIES IN THIS, AS WE 

503
00:13:27,501 --> 00:13:29,136
TALKED ABOUT DURING THIS, 

504
00:13:29,136 --> 00:13:31,304
BECAUSE WE HAVE STRICT 

505
00:13:31,304 --> 00:13:34,375
REGULATIONS TO REACH OUR PARIS 

506
00:13:34,375 --> 00:13:34,875
TARGETS.

507
00:13:34,875 --> 00:13:37,110
THAT MEANS THAT WE HAVE VERY 

508
00:13:37,110 --> 00:13:38,879
STRONG POLICIES FOR 

509
00:13:38,879 --> 00:13:39,713
ENVIRONMENTAL FRIENDLY AND 

510
00:13:39,713 --> 00:13:41,715
CLIMATE FRIENDLY TECHNOLOGIES 

511
00:13:41,715 --> 00:13:43,583
WHICH IS PART OF WHY THE UNITED 

512
00:13:43,583 --> 00:13:45,652
STATES NOW HAS A SURPLUS IN THE 

513
00:13:45,652 --> 00:13:47,254
ECONOMY TOWARDS NORWAY, SO YOU 

514
00:13:47,254 --> 00:13:48,822
NEVER MESS UP ON A GOOD 

515
00:13:48,822 --> 00:13:50,991
OPPORTUNITY WITH GOOD 

516
00:13:50,991 --> 00:13:51,525
ENVIRONMENTAL STANDARDS.

517
00:13:51,525 --> 00:13:53,360
>> ONE OF THE GREAT ASSETS OF 

518
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:55,763
NORWAY IS A THING CALLED WATER.

519
00:13:55,763 --> 00:13:58,665
THEY HAVE TREMENDOUS HYDROPOWER.

520
00:13:58,665 --> 00:13:58,965
TREMENDOUS.

521
00:13:58,965 --> 00:14:01,301
IN FACT, MOST OF YOUR ENERGY AND

522
00:14:01,301 --> 00:14:03,804
YOUR ELECTRICITY IS PRODUCED BY 

523
00:14:03,804 --> 00:14:04,638
HYDRO.

524
00:14:04,638 --> 00:14:06,707
I WISH WE WOULD DO SOME OF THAT,

525
00:14:06,707 --> 00:14:08,308
BUT IT'S FANTASTIC AND A GREAT 

526
00:14:08,308 --> 00:14:08,909
ASSET YOU HAVE.

527
00:14:08,909 --> 00:14:09,342
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

528
00:14:09,342 --> 00:14:09,643
GREAT HONOR.

529
00:14:09,643 --> 00:14:10,778
THANK YOU.

530
00:14:10,778 --> 00:14:13,313
>> THANK YOU.

531
00:14:13,313 --> 00:14:16,716
>> MR. PRESIDENT, IS THE SPECIAL

532
00:14:16,716 --> 00:14:18,218
COUNSEL STILL DETERMINING 

533
00:14:18,218 --> 00:14:19,453
WHETHER THERE WAS COLLUSION?

534
00:14:19,453 --> 00:14:20,620
>> THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

535
00:14:20,620 --> 00:14:21,755
>> PRESIDENT TRUMP WALKING OUT 

536
00:14:21,755 --> 00:14:24,257
OF THE EAST ROOM WITH THE PRIME 

537
00:14:24,257 --> 00:14:25,559
MINISTER OF NORWAY.

538
00:14:25,559 --> 00:14:26,626
ONE FINAL QUESTION ON RUSSIA 

539
00:14:26,626 --> 00:14:28,462
WHICH WAS A TOPIC THAT CAME UP 

540
00:14:28,462 --> 00:14:30,464
SEVERAL TIMES IN A RELATIVELY 

541
00:14:30,464 --> 00:14:31,732
SHORT PRESS CONFERENCE.

542
00:14:31,732 --> 00:14:33,300
YOU SEE MIKE PENCE AS WELL.

543
00:14:33,300 --> 00:14:34,434
THE PRESIDENT REPEATING WHAT WE 

544
00:14:34,434 --> 00:14:36,203
HAVE HEARD IN THE PAST, THAT THE

545
00:14:36,203 --> 00:14:37,103
RUSSIAN INVESTIGATION WAS A 

546
00:14:37,103 --> 00:14:38,972
WITCH HUNT AND THERE'S BEEN NO 

547
00:14:38,972 --> 00:14:39,973
COLLUSION BETWEEN THE TRUMP 

548
00:14:39,973 --> 00:14:41,008
CAMPAIGN AND RUSSIA.

549
00:14:41,008 --> 00:14:43,243
HE SAID THE ONLY COLLUSION WAS 

550
00:14:43,243 --> 00:14:45,378
DEMOCRATIC COLLUSION, OF COURSE,

551
00:14:45,378 --> 00:14:46,613
SINCE MUELLER'S INVESTIGATION, 

552
00:14:46,613 --> 00:14:48,014
WE HAVE LEARNED OF SOMETHING 

553
00:14:48,014 --> 00:14:50,917
LIKE 30 CONTACTS BETWEEN THE 

554
00:14:50,917 --> 00:14:52,486
TRUMP CAMPAIGN, TRUMP ASSOCIATES

555
00:14:52,486 --> 00:14:53,687
AND THE RUSSIANS.

556
00:14:53,687 --> 00:14:58,492
THAT INVESTIGATION CONTINUES, 

557
00:14:58,492 --> 00:14:59,793
BOTH THE SPECIAL COUNSEL AND ON 

558
00:14:59,793 --> 00:15:00,160
CAPITOL HILL.

559
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:01,528
THE PRESIDENT ALSO GOT A 

560
00:15:01,528 --> 00:15:02,763
QUESTION FROM JOHN ROBERTS OF 

561
00:15:02,763 --> 00:15:04,097
FOX ON WHETHER OR NOT HE WOULD 

562
00:15:04,097 --> 00:15:05,499
BE WILLING TO SIT DOWN WITH 

563
00:15:05,499 --> 00:15:07,267
MUELLER AND HIS ATTORNEYS IF AN 

564
00:15:07,267 --> 00:15:08,268
INTERVIEW IS REQUESTED.

565
00:15:08,268 --> 00:15:09,436
LAST YEAR, YOU ASKED THE 

566
00:15:09,436 --> 00:15:10,204
PRESIDENT A QUESTION.

567
00:15:10,204 --> 00:15:11,538
HE SAID 100% YES.

568
00:15:11,538 --> 00:15:12,673
THAT'S NOT THE ANSWER WE GOT 

569
00:15:12,673 --> 00:15:12,873
TODAY.

570
00:15:12,873 --> 00:15:14,641
>> NO, QUITE A DIFFERENT 

571
00:15:14,641 --> 00:15:14,908
QUESTION.

572
00:15:14,908 --> 00:15:17,578
THE PRESIDENT SAID THERE HAS 

573
00:15:17,578 --> 00:15:19,480
BEEN NO EVIDENCE OF KOO 

574
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:20,314
COLLUSION, THEREFORE, QUOTE, IT 

575
00:15:20,314 --> 00:15:22,149
IS UNLIKELY YOU WOULD NEED AN 

576
00:15:22,149 --> 00:15:22,549
INTERVIEW.

577
00:15:22,549 --> 00:15:24,217
SO THAT SEEMED TO BE QUITE 

578
00:15:24,217 --> 00:15:27,354
CLEARLY BACKING AWAY FROM THE 

579
00:15:27,354 --> 00:15:27,554
OFFER.

580
00:15:27,554 --> 00:15:28,655
BACK IN JUNE WHEN I ASKED HIM 

581
00:15:28,655 --> 00:15:29,890
THAT QUESTION, HE SEEMED NOT 

582
00:15:29,890 --> 00:15:31,958
ONLY WILLING TO TALK TO MUELLER 

583
00:15:31,958 --> 00:15:34,294
BUT EAGER TO GIVE THE SPECIAL 

584
00:15:34,294 --> 00:15:35,762
COUNSEL HIS VERSION OF EVENTS.

585
00:15:35,762 --> 00:15:37,731
HE WAS ASKED THE QUESTION, A 

586
00:15:37,731 --> 00:15:39,599
VARIATION OF THE QUESTION AGAIN 

587
00:15:39,599 --> 00:15:41,668
OVER THE WEEKEND AT CAMP DAVID, 

588
00:15:41,668 --> 00:15:43,570
AND HE SAID, QUITE SIMPLY, YEAH,

589
00:15:43,570 --> 00:15:44,637
WHEN ASKED WOULD HE BE WILLING 

590
00:15:44,637 --> 00:15:46,607
TO DO AN INTERVIEW WITH MUELLER 

591
00:15:46,607 --> 00:15:46,874
NOW.

592
00:15:46,874 --> 00:15:48,275
HE DIDN'T QUITE SAY HE WAS 

593
00:15:48,275 --> 00:15:50,476
UNWILLING TO DO IT, BUT SUCH AN 

594
00:15:50,476 --> 00:15:52,446
INTERVIEW WOULD NOT BE 

595
00:15:52,446 --> 00:15:52,713
NECESSARY.

596
00:15:52,713 --> 00:15:53,013
>> OKAY.

597
00:15:53,013 --> 00:15:55,782
AND I WANT TO GO TO OUR SENIOR 

598
00:15:55,782 --> 00:15:56,783
CONGRESSIONAL CORRESPONDENT, 

599
00:15:56,783 --> 00:15:57,951
MARY BRUCE.

600
00:15:57,951 --> 00:15:59,319
IMMIGRATION, ANOTHER TOPIC THE 

601
00:15:59,319 --> 00:16:00,320
PRESIDENT GOT A QUESTION ON.

602
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:01,755
THE FIRST QUESTION, WHETHER OR 

603
00:16:01,755 --> 00:16:03,557
NOT HE WAS STILL FOR A BORDER 

604
00:16:03,557 --> 00:16:04,758
WALL AND ANY DEAL THAT WOULD 

605
00:16:04,758 --> 00:16:05,859
ALSO LEAD TO PROTECTIONS FOR 

606
00:16:05,859 --> 00:16:08,061
THOSE D.R.E.A.M.ers.

607
00:16:08,061 --> 00:16:08,895
800,000 YOUNG PEOPLE WHO WERE 

608
00:16:08,895 --> 00:16:10,597
BROUGHT HERE AS CHILDREN BY 

609
00:16:10,597 --> 00:16:11,498
UNDOCUMENTED PARENTS.

610
00:16:11,498 --> 00:16:12,866
THE PRESIDENT TODAY SAID A WALL 

611
00:16:12,866 --> 00:16:16,470
IS ESSENTIAL.

612
00:16:16,470 --> 00:16:17,304
YESTERDAY AT THAT BIPARTISAN 

613
00:16:17,304 --> 00:16:18,739
MEETING, HE DIDN'T INSIST ON THE

614
00:16:18,739 --> 00:16:18,939
WALL.

615
00:16:18,939 --> 00:16:20,340
HE TALKED ABOUT BOARDER 

616
00:16:20,340 --> 00:16:20,607
SECURITY.

617
00:16:20,607 --> 00:16:21,741
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN ON CAPITOL 

618
00:16:21,741 --> 00:16:22,075
HILL.

619
00:16:22,075 --> 00:16:23,210
>> THAT'S THE BIG QUESTION.

620
00:16:23,210 --> 00:16:24,311
THE PRESIDENT, EVEN THOUGH HE 

621
00:16:24,311 --> 00:16:26,813
SEEMS TO BE SENDING MIXED 

622
00:16:26,813 --> 00:16:28,915
MESSAGES SO MUCH COMES DOWN TO 

623
00:16:28,915 --> 00:16:30,283
HOW YOU ACTUALLY DEFINE THE 

624
00:16:30,283 --> 00:16:31,218
WALL.

625
00:16:31,218 --> 00:16:32,319
LAWMAKERS UP HERE BELIEVE IT'S 

626
00:16:32,319 --> 00:16:33,954
NOT AN ACTUAL PHYSICAL WALL AS 

627
00:16:33,954 --> 00:16:35,589
THE PRESIDENT ADMITTED OR SEEMED

628
00:16:35,589 --> 00:16:36,856
TO CONCEDE YESTERDAY, THAT HE 

629
00:16:36,856 --> 00:16:38,258
WASN'T ASKING FOR FUNDING RIGHT 

630
00:16:38,258 --> 00:16:41,427
NOW TO BUILD A 2,000-MILE-LONG 

631
00:16:41,427 --> 00:16:41,628
WALL.

632
00:16:41,628 --> 00:16:44,130
THIS MAY BE MORE OF A FENCE, A 

633
00:16:44,130 --> 00:16:45,499
BOOST IN BORDER SECURITY.

634
00:16:45,499 --> 00:16:46,733
LAWMAKERS ARE STILL HUDDLING 

635
00:16:46,733 --> 00:16:48,468
HERE AT THE CAPITOL, TRYING TO 

636
00:16:48,468 --> 00:16:49,903
HAMMER OUT AN IMMIGRATION DEAL, 

637
00:16:49,903 --> 00:16:51,605
A DEAL TO PROTECT D.R.E.A.M.ers 

638
00:16:51,605 --> 00:16:53,139
AND ALSO POSSIBLY BOOST THAT 

639
00:16:53,139 --> 00:16:54,474
BROADER BORDER SECURITY THAT THE

640
00:16:54,474 --> 00:16:56,109
WHITE HOUSE MAY BE LOOKING FOR 

641
00:16:56,109 --> 00:16:56,810
HERE.

642
00:16:56,810 --> 00:16:58,545
AND I'M TOLD, I WAS JUST TALKING

643
00:16:58,545 --> 00:16:59,780
WITH LAWMAKERS IN THESE MEETINGS

644
00:16:59,780 --> 00:17:00,881
ON BOTH SIDES OF THE AISLE.

645
00:17:00,881 --> 00:17:02,249
THEY INSIST THEY ARE GETTING 

646
00:17:02,249 --> 00:17:02,449
CLOSE.

647
00:17:02,449 --> 00:17:03,583
THEY ARE MAKING PROGRESS.

648
00:17:03,583 --> 00:17:05,251
THAT YOU COULD SEE A DEAL HERE 

649
00:17:05,251 --> 00:17:06,419
SOONER RATHER THAN LATER.

650
00:17:06,419 --> 00:17:07,854
PERHAPS EVEN BY THE END OF THE 

651
00:17:07,854 --> 00:17:08,054
MONTH.

652
00:17:08,054 --> 00:17:10,390
>> THAT DEAL, MARY, NOT REALLY 

653
00:17:10,390 --> 00:17:11,290
TALKING ABOUT A PHYSICAL WALL.

654
00:17:11,290 --> 00:17:12,893
THEY'RE GOING TO PASS SOME 

655
00:17:12,893 --> 00:17:14,327
BEEFED UP BORDER SECURITY AND 

656
00:17:14,327 --> 00:17:15,395
BASICALLY LEAVE IT UP TO THE 

657
00:17:15,395 --> 00:17:16,329
PRESIDENT ON WHETHER HE'S GOING 

658
00:17:16,329 --> 00:17:17,196
TO CALL THAT A WALL.

659
00:17:17,196 --> 00:17:18,397
>> ABSOLUTELY.

660
00:17:18,397 --> 00:17:19,531
THIS ALL WILL COME DOWN TO HOW 

661
00:17:19,531 --> 00:17:21,134
YOU PLAY THIS.

662
00:17:21,134 --> 00:17:22,469
THE SEMANTICS OF THIS.

663
00:17:22,469 --> 00:17:23,336
REMEMBER, YESTERDAY, THE 

664
00:17:23,336 --> 00:17:26,506
PRESIDENT IN THAT RATHER 

665
00:17:26,506 --> 00:17:27,073
UNPRECEDENTED MEETING WITH 

666
00:17:27,073 --> 00:17:28,342
LAWMAKERS SAID ULTIMATELY IT WAS

667
00:17:28,342 --> 00:17:29,209
UP TO CONGRESS.

668
00:17:29,209 --> 00:17:30,677
HE WOULD SIGN WHATEVER CONGRESS 

669
00:17:30,677 --> 00:17:32,212
CAN AGREE TO.

670
00:17:32,212 --> 00:17:34,948
>> CECELIA VEGA IS THERE AS WELL

671
00:17:34,948 --> 00:17:36,583
OUT THERE IN THE WHITE HOUSE.

672
00:17:36,583 --> 00:17:38,719
AND CECELIA, I WAS STRUCK AGAIN 

673
00:17:38,719 --> 00:17:39,486
WHEN THE PRESIDENT GOT A 

674
00:17:39,486 --> 00:17:40,353
QUESTION ABOUT RUSSIA.

675
00:17:40,353 --> 00:17:43,322
HE DID PUSH BACK A LITTLE BIT ON

676
00:17:43,322 --> 00:17:44,057
PUTIN.

677
00:17:44,057 --> 00:17:45,092
UNLIKE SOME OF HIS STATEMENTS IN

678
00:17:45,092 --> 00:17:46,159
THE PAST, BUT ALSO BROUGHT UP 

679
00:17:46,159 --> 00:17:47,794
THE CAMPAIGN ONE MORE TIME.

680
00:17:47,794 --> 00:17:49,029
>> OH, GEORGE, THAT'S ON MY 

681
00:17:49,029 --> 00:17:49,296
NOTES.

682
00:17:49,296 --> 00:17:50,396
IT WAS SOMETHING I WAS GOING TO 

683
00:17:50,396 --> 00:17:51,365
BRING UP TO YOU.

684
00:17:51,365 --> 00:17:52,833
HERE WE ARE A YEAR IN, ALMOST A 

685
00:17:52,833 --> 00:17:54,367
YEAR TO THE DATE THAT THIS 

686
00:17:54,367 --> 00:17:55,669
PRESIDENT WAS SWORN IN AND HE'S 

687
00:17:55,669 --> 00:17:56,602
STILL TALKING ABOUT HILLARY 

688
00:17:56,602 --> 00:17:56,970
CLINTON.

689
00:17:56,970 --> 00:17:59,239
THAT IS HIS GO-TO DE FACTO 

690
00:17:59,239 --> 00:17:59,472
ANSWER.

691
00:17:59,472 --> 00:18:02,075
IT'S BECOME REALLY A RECORD, A 

692
00:18:02,075 --> 00:18:03,310
BROKEN RECORD FOR HIM, IF YOU 

693
00:18:03,310 --> 00:18:04,644
WILL, ON HIS ANSWER ABOUT RUSSIA

694
00:18:04,644 --> 00:18:06,680
TO ANY QUESTIONS ABOUT RUSSIA.

695
00:18:06,680 --> 00:18:08,382
IT'S ONE OF THE HEADLINES OUT OF

696
00:18:08,382 --> 00:18:09,549
THIS VERY SHORT PRESS 

697
00:18:09,549 --> 00:18:10,917
CONFERENCE, THE FACT HE'S STILL 

698
00:18:10,917 --> 00:18:11,951
HAMMERING AWAY AT HILLARY 

699
00:18:11,951 --> 00:18:12,252
CLINTON.

700
00:18:12,252 --> 00:18:14,488
THAT'S THE MESSAGE HE FEELS VERY

701
00:18:14,488 --> 00:18:14,755
SLIGHTED.

702
00:18:14,755 --> 00:18:18,892
HE DOES NOT WANT TO TALK ABOUT 

703
00:18:18,892 --> 00:18:22,229
RUSSIA, BUT REALLY THE HINE IS 

704
00:18:22,229 --> 00:18:24,031

00:18:24,031 --> 00:18:25,332
