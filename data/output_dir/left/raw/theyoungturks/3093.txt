1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:04,040
THE PARLIAMENT IN AUSTRALIA HAS
OFFICIALLY VOTEDON

2
00:00:04,040 --> 00:00:14,300
LEGALIZING GAY MARRIAGE IT CAME
THREE WEEKS AFTER A NATIONAL

3
00:00:14,300 --> 00:00:18,890
REFERENDUM SHOWED STRONG PUBLIC
SUPPORT FOR GAY MARRIAGE.

4
00:00:18,890 --> 00:00:25,740
THE REFERENDUM INDICATED THAT
61% OF THE VOTERS WERE IN FAVOR

5
00:00:25,740 --> 00:00:32,400
OF LEGALIZING SAME-SEX MARRIAGE
BUT IT WAS NONBINDING.

6
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:35,880
LUCKILY THEY DID TAKE ACTION AND
VOTE IN THE BEST INTEREST

7
00:00:35,880 --> 00:01:02,860
TO REPRESENT THE PEOPLE OF
AUSTRALIA AND WHAT THEY WANTED.

8
00:01:02,860 --> 00:01:07,630
THIS IS GREAT NEWS BUT THERE WAS
ALSO ANOTHER COMPONENT TO THE

9
00:01:07,630 --> 00:01:11,780
STORY THAT HAPPENED EARLIER THAT
WE DIDN'T GET TO.

10
00:01:11,780 --> 00:01:14,860
I THOUGHT NOW WOULD BE A PERFECT
OPPORTUNITY TO DO SO.

11
00:01:14,860 --> 00:01:20,280
TIM WILSON WHO IS A MEMBER OF
PARLIAMENT DECIDED TO DO

12
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:23,830
SOMETHING EXTRAORDINARY WHILE
TALKING ABOUT THIS LEGISLATION.

13
00:01:23,830 --> 00:01:25,460
TAKE A LOOK.

14
00:01:25,460 --> 00:01:31,340
>> THIS DEBATE HAS BEEN THE
SOUNDTRACK TO OUR RELATIONSHIP.

15
00:01:31,340 --> 00:01:34,750
WE BOTH KNOW THIS ISSUE ISN'T
THE REASON WE GOT INVOLVED IN

16
00:01:34,750 --> 00:01:36,320
POLITICS.

17
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:39,180
GIVE US TAX REFORM ANY DAY.

18
00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:43,700
BUT IN MY FIRST SPEECH I DEFINED
OUR BOND BY THE RING THAT SITS

19
00:01:43,700 --> 00:01:52,159
ON BOTH OF OUR LEFT HANDS.

20
00:01:52,159 --> 00:02:04,240
SO THERE'S ONLY ONE THING LEFT
TO DO, RYAN WILL YOU MARRY ME?

21
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:05,890
>> I LIKE IT.

22
00:02:05,890 --> 00:02:10,038
>> THAT IS WONDERFUL.

23
00:02:10,038 --> 00:02:15,360
IT IS FRUSTRATING THAT WE HAVE
TO FIGHT TO JUST GET PEOPLE TO

24
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:18,830
RECOGNIZE THAT GAY HUMAN BEINGS
SHOULD BE TREATED THE SAME

25
00:02:18,830 --> 00:02:20,350
WAY AS STRAIGHT ONES.

26
00:02:20,350 --> 00:02:23,860
IS NOT THAT HARD TO ASK.

27
00:02:23,860 --> 00:02:26,330
WE ARE ALL PEOPLE, WE ARE ALL
THE SAME.

28
00:02:26,330 --> 00:02:33,030
THESE ARE DEMOCRACIES YET WE
STILL STRUGGLE FOR THE BARE

29
00:02:33,030 --> 00:02:42,880
MINIMUM.

30
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:47,790
ON A DAY LIKE TODAY WE REALLY
SHOULD TAKE A MOMENT TO

31
00:02:47,790 --> 00:02:48,790
CELEBRATE.

32
00:02:48,790 --> 00:02:56,710
THEY 
ALWAYS WORN ON FOX NEWS

33
00:02:56,710 --> 00:03:00,340
THAT WE ARE WINNING THE

34
00:03:00,340 --> 00:03:01,370
CULTURE WARS.

35
00:03:01,370 --> 00:03:02,370
THEY ARE RIGHT.

36
00:03:02,370 --> 00:03:05,610
OUR SIDE SAYS THAT ALL HUMAN
BEINGS ARE EQUAL, THEY SAY

37
00:03:05,610 --> 00:03:09,020
THAT IS NOT THE CASE.

38
00:03:09,020 --> 00:03:15,660
FOR GAY PEOPLE THEY ARE
DEFINITELY A LOWER CATEGORY.

39
00:03:15,660 --> 00:03:23,560
61% IN AUSTRALIA AND SO MANY
OTHER PLACES YES WITH THE HELP

40
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:26,440
OF THE INTERNET AND OUR
INTERCONNECTEDNESS AND KNOWLEDGE

41
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:29,319
AND TRUTH AND INFORMATION PEOPLE
ARE LOOKING AROUND AND GOING

42
00:03:29,319 --> 00:03:33,230
WAIT A MINUTE THEY KEEP SAYING
THAT BEING GAY IS UNNATURAL.

43
00:03:33,230 --> 00:03:40,150
THEN WHY ARE THERE SO MANY GAY
HUMANS ALL AROUND THE WORLD.

44
00:03:40,150 --> 00:03:44,200
PERHAPS SOME OF OUR ANCIENT
HATREDS ARE IN FACT ANCIENT

45
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:46,810
AND MAKE NO SENSE AT ALL TODAY.

46
00:03:46,810 --> 00:03:49,730
YES WHERE WINNING WHEN A DAY
LIKE TODAY WHEN AUSTRALIA PASSES

47
00:03:49,730 --> 00:03:56,040
THIS I AM THRILLED AND PROUD TO
BE ON THE RIGHT SIDE OF HISTORY

48
00:03:56,040 --> 00:04:00,370
AND I'M SO HAPPY FOR THE LGBT
BROTHERS AND SISTERS IN

49
00:04:00,370 --> 00:04:05,069
AUSTRALIA AND I HOPE WE WENT ALL
ACROSS THE WORLD AND CRUSH THE

50
00:04:05,069 --> 00:04:08,490
DEMAGOGUES ON THE RIGHT WHEN
THEY TRY TO DENY EQUAL

51
00:04:08,490 --> 00:04:10,290
RIGHTS TO OUR FELLOW HUMAN
BEINGS.

52
00:04:10,290 --> 00:04:14,720
>> OF COURSE I'M HAPPY THERE
IS MORE EQUALITY FOR GAY

53
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:17,209
COUPLES LIVING IN AUSTRALIA.

54
00:04:17,209 --> 00:04:22,389
FOR ME THERE IS A BROADER POINT
TO THIS STORY THAT I THINK

55
00:04:22,389 --> 00:04:23,610
GOES TO WHAT YOU ARE SAYING.

56
00:04:23,610 --> 00:04:27,330
IS FRUSTRATING THAT YOU HAVE TO
FIGHT SO HARD FOR THINGS

57
00:04:27,330 --> 00:04:29,430
THAT SHOULD NOT BE HARD TO FIGHT
FOR.

58
00:04:29,430 --> 00:04:35,629
THEY SHOULD BE COMMON SENSE LIKE
EQUALITY.

59
00:04:35,629 --> 00:04:37,879
RIGHT NOW IN THE UNITED STATES
WE ARE DEALING WITH A VERY

60
00:04:37,879 --> 00:04:43,080
TUMULTUOUS TIME, A LOT OF
DESPAIR, PEOPLE FEELING THAT

61
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:58,759
FIGHTING IS LEADING 
TO NOTHING.

62
00:04:58,759 --> 00:05:00,990
THAT IS AMAZING TO ME BECAUSE

63
00:05:00,990 --> 00:05:04,729
THAT TELLS ME YOU HAVE TO KEEP
FIGHTING REGARDLESS OF WHAT THE

64
00:05:04,729 --> 00:05:16,520
ISSUE IS THAT YOU ARE MOST
PASSIONATE ABOUT, KEEP FIGHTING.

65
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:19,229
>> PEOPLE THINK OFTENTIMES IT IS
NOT REALISTIC.

66
00:05:19,229 --> 00:05:21,610
THAT IS NOT TRUE.

67
00:05:21,610 --> 00:05:26,259
OPTIMISM IS WARRANTED.

68
00:05:26,259 --> 00:05:29,570
WE WON ON THE ISSUE OF SLAVERY
AND CIVIL RIGHTS.

69
00:05:29,570 --> 00:05:31,150
NOW WE ARE WINNING ON THE ISSUE
OF GAY RIGHTS.

70
00:05:31,150 --> 00:05:34,310
WE NEVER WOULD'VE ONE IF WE HAD
ACTUALLY CHANGE PEOPLE'S

71
00:05:34,310 --> 00:05:35,990
MINDS AND CHANGE THE CULTURE.

72
00:05:35,990 --> 00:05:40,879
BUT WE HAVE THROUGH FIGHTING AND
BEING RIGHT.

73
00:05:40,879 --> 00:05:46,129
61% OF PEOPLE IN AUSTRALIA SAID
YES, OUR FELLOW BROTHERS

74
00:05:46,129 --> 00:05:49,410
AND SISTERS WHO ARE GAY ARE JUST
AS HUMAN AS US.

75
00:05:49,410 --> 00:05:58,969
NOW IT'S TICKET TO 
EVERY SINGLE

76
00:05:58,969 --> 00:00:00,000
COUNTRY ON 
THE PLANET.
