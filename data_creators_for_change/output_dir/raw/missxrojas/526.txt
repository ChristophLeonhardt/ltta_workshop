out there just far away in the distance

14
00:00:27,930 --> 00:00:30,720
I'm definitely not old enough to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be 19</font>

15
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:32,520
at any point in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the near future so it's</font>

16
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:33,989
probably a<font color="#CCCCCC"> good</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> thing that I'm not going</font>

26
00:00:55,020 --> 00:00:57,120
life and grumpy because I've working out

27
00:00:57,120 --> 00:00:59,789

hot sunshine and surrounded by<font color="#E5E5E5"> my</font>

29
00:01:01,559 --> 00:01:04,920
friends not really surrounded by a lot

30
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:06,479
of people<font color="#E5E5E5"> apart from my Winnie the Pooh</font>

31

stuffed toy and<font color="#E5E5E5"> great gray cloud</font>

32
00:01:10,229 --> 00:01:12,799
everywhere and slightly heavy rain and

33
00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:15,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">wreck I can't really complain though</font>

34
00:01:15,810 --> 00:01:17,610
because I have been lucky enough to have

35
00:01:17,610 --> 00:01:19,619
such an amazing holiday i went<font color="#E5E5E5"> from</font>

36
00:01:19,619 --> 00:01:22,170
Laguna Beach area to LA to San Francisco

37
00:01:22,170 --> 00:01:26,640
to San Diego to anaheim disneyland kind

38
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:29,579
of practically living there for a bit to

39
00:01:29,579 --> 00:01:33,720
hollywood to home so that<font color="#E5E5E5"> was a pretty</font>

40
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:34,799
<font color="#E5E5E5">good bounce especially when you factor</font>

41
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:36,329
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the fact i went to a Harry Potter</font>

42
00:01:36,329 --> 00:01:39,630
convention and<font color="#E5E5E5"> comic-con and San Diego</font>

43
00:01:39,630 --> 00:01:41,490
Zoo which I wrote excited about and like

44
00:01:41,490 --> 00:01:42,990
the Dodgers game and all this other

45
00:01:42,990 --> 00:01:44,880
amazingly cool stuff<font color="#CCCCCC"> that I went</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

46
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:46,649
wrong the way in the fact that I drove

47
00:01:46,649 --> 00:01:48,600
up<font color="#CCCCCC"> from LA to San Francisco with</font>

48
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:50,310
podcasts and Remus Lupin<font color="#CCCCCC"> xin the</font>

49
00:01:50,310 --> 00:01:52,320
whomping willows that what is my life it

50
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:55,020
to me it feels<font color="#CCCCCC"> like the life of someone</font>

51
00:01:55,020 --> 00:01:57,659
<font color="#E5E5E5">else sometimes but it has</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just been so</font>

52
00:01:57,659 --> 00:01:59,549
incredible and factored into that was a

53
00:01:59,549 --> 00:02:01,740
fact that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I really enjoyed the sixth</font>

54
00:02:01,740 --> 00:02:04,049
harry potter film an awful lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> when's</font>

55
00:02:04,049 --> 00:02:06,030
<font color="#CCCCCC">akali the harry potter related shop</font>

56
00:02:06,030 --> 00:02:07,170
thing in

57
00:02:07,170 --> 00:02:08,818
demonically didn't advance previous

58
00:02:08,818 --> 00:02:10,410
screening at two p.m. the night before

59
00:02:10,410 --> 00:02:12,030
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> release the day before the release</font>

60
00:02:12,030 --> 00:02:13,650
rather I was kind of blown away<font color="#E5E5E5"> by it</font>

61
00:02:13,650 --> 00:02:15,239
and just seeing<font color="#E5E5E5"> it with all my</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> friends</font>

62
00:02:15,239 --> 00:02:18,239
that most of them just feel the exact

63
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:20,660
same way I do about the books and the

64
00:02:20,660 --> 00:02:22,800
fandom and the experience and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I thing</font>

65
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:24,989
that was just special but the fact that

66
00:02:24,989 --> 00:02:27,870
I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that will be acting his improved</font>

67
00:02:27,870 --> 00:02:30,780
by<font color="#CCCCCC"> Miles I mean my main quibble would be</font>

68
00:02:30,780 --> 00:02:33,750
Jenny just the fact that I don't think

69
00:02:33,750 --> 00:02:36,930
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> they have done justice to her</font>

70
00:02:36,930 --> 00:02:40,530
character or to her gender or just do

71
00:02:40,530 --> 00:02:42,870
the actress all the kind of weird flirty

72
00:02:42,870 --> 00:02:45,180
stuff especially with shoelaces and

73
00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:47,610
other things can stay hidden up here too

74
00:02:47,610 --> 00:02:49,140
I mean that was all really bad Harry and

75
00:02:49,140 --> 00:02:52,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">Felix Felicis oh my gosh I have never</font>

76
00:02:52,860 --> 00:02:54,720
seen a funny a part of<font color="#E5E5E5"> high water ever</font>

77
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:57,360
in my you know it was really<font color="#CCCCCC"> well done</font>

78
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:59,370
they did that brilliantly with the

79
00:02:59,370 --> 00:03:01,350
pizzas and<font color="#E5E5E5"> we'll of it I did cry a lot</font>

80
00:03:01,350 --> 00:03:03,150
at the end which means that on some

81
00:03:03,150 --> 00:03:05,280
level that had some<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of emotional</font>

82
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:06,450
effect to me and I thought<font color="#E5E5E5"> Michael</font>

83
00:03:06,450 --> 00:03:08,400
Gambon was far more of a Dumbledore than

84
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:10,489
he has ever been<font color="#CCCCCC"> in any other films</font>

85
00:03:10,489 --> 00:03:14,130
which was brilliant to see as<font color="#E5E5E5"> well and I</font>

86
00:03:14,130 --> 00:03:16,380
think the story just moved a lot better

87
00:03:16,380 --> 00:03:19,650
and it was more complete and I liked it

88
00:03:19,650 --> 00:03:23,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">a lot more</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> than i had and tom Felton Wow</font>

89
00:03:23,010 --> 00:03:26,640
as JK Malfoy was just absolutely

90
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:29,970
brilliant and you know Emma Watson tone

91
00:03:29,970 --> 00:03:32,040
down that hermione to a place that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

92
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:33,720
think was more her money than it has

93
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:35,940
been before and I could<font color="#E5E5E5"> really imagine</font>

94
00:03:35,940 --> 00:03:40,530
that graveyard scene from Deathly

95
00:03:40,530 --> 00:03:41,760
Hallows I could<font color="#E5E5E5"> really imagine the</font>

96
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:44,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">dynamic between Harry and Hermione ah</font>

97
00:03:44,420 --> 00:03:47,640
lavender and Ron were just so funny as

98
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:49,890
well and it<font color="#E5E5E5"> was just brilliant I was</font>

99
00:03:49,890 --> 00:03:51,930
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> impressed by</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it I really have</font>

100
00:03:51,930 --> 00:03:53,340
learnt to separate the books and films

101
00:03:53,340 --> 00:03:54,989
now books will always be number one but

102
00:03:54,989 --> 00:03:56,700
doesn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> mean we can't enjoy the films</font>

103
00:03:56,700 --> 00:03:58,470
and I really did and so I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

104
00:03:58,470 --> 00:04:01,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">kind of laced in nicely with my whole</font>

105
00:04:01,140 --> 00:04:02,850
trip I went<font color="#E5E5E5"> to dis in mind a lot</font>

106
00:04:02,850 --> 00:04:04,920
especially space mountain I never went

107
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:06,780
on Matterhorn and I really like tower of

108
00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:08,280
terror<font color="#CCCCCC"> halleh for new adventure as well</font>

109
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:10,290
it was<font color="#E5E5E5"> just brilliant and comic con was</font>

110
00:04:10,290 --> 00:04:12,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">yeah really putting it as well I mean</font>

111
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:13,980
the disney pixar panel the animation

112
00:04:13,980 --> 00:04:15,299
panel<font color="#E5E5E5"> i was lucky enough to get in and</font>

113
00:04:15,299 --> 00:04:18,599
John Lasseter is just one of that I I

114
00:04:18,599 --> 00:04:20,410
heard an amazing I think he's

115
00:04:20,410 --> 00:04:22,120
21st century Walters need to be honest

116
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:23,740
I'm always really impressed by<font color="#E5E5E5"> him and</font>

117
00:04:23,740 --> 00:04:25,690
he presented the whole panel<font color="#E5E5E5"> really well</font>

118
00:04:25,690 --> 00:04:28,420
he's just<font color="#E5E5E5"> you could feel that Pixar</font>

119
00:04:28,420 --> 00:04:29,950
running through his veins and it was

120
00:04:29,950 --> 00:04:32,160
just so exciting to see him up there

121
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:34,720
especially interviewing people like<font color="#E5E5E5"> hi</font>

122
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:37,720
<font color="#CCCCCC">Aaron miyazaki who as</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> studio ghibli and</font>

00:04:45,430 --> 00:04:49,090
know quite well at a comic comp which

128
00:04:49,090 --> 00:04:51,880

00:04:58,090 --> 00:04:59,650

140
00:05:09,220 --> 00:05:10,870
video that I managed to do when I was in

schools of unedited shaky camera footage

145
00:05:19,030 --> 00:05:20,740
that I took while I was out there and

146
00:05:20,740 --> 00:05:23,740
prepared<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be bombarded by random clips</font>
