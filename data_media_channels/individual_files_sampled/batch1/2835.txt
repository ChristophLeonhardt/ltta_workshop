hello everyone thanks for joining us we're joined today by two guests from GE Linda Boff the chief marketing officer and rusty Irving chief engineer we're going to talk about the industrial internet basically the incorporation of digital into all the big machines that run our world and the evolution of marketing which is in the midst of a seismic shift right now so let's start with the industrial Internet what is the industrial Internet and why should normal people care about so I'm going to give you the normal people care about it and then rusty is going to go a little bit deeper if you will so maybe three four or five years ago Henry we sort of said look you know GE has been about making things we have this deep deep heritage and manufacturing but the future is going to be about making and connecting machines big iron meets big data if you will and we kind of helped coin this term industrial internet the Internet of really big things and this is the future of the company I mean this is a major pivot for us we've got as I think you and I have talked about before on a big group of people in san ramon you know maybe a thousand people in san ramon we opened maybe three weeks ago sort of mini version of san ramon a foundry in Paris will have one in Boston in our new headquarters we're hiring software engineers and computer scientists because we you know for us the industrial Internet is new you'll hear this from rusty is all about driving outcomes for our customers so you know rusty all I'll turn to you to sort of help dimensionalize this a little bit right and you know consumers are very familiar with the internet we watched through the 90s up through today how you went from you know very static pages to get information about products to being able to purchase products to today having proc products recommended to you will all interconnected we have many channels to interact with each other all digital so now all of a sudden industrial internet is replace kind of the people as the subject matter with things or our industrial machines except that you need a much more heavyweight type of Internet to be able to do this because the data is much more enormous much greater in size and much more complex to understand so with the advent of cloud computing is really one of the trends that enabled us to take advantage of it and build something that's heavyweight enough for us to build an internet for our assets and make them work better for customers so let's talk about specifics so you make the engines that power the Dreamliner the new Boeing plans that everybody loves they're all industrial internet eyes too they're filled with sensors what does that do how does that help sure so you know even at the most basic level we take three parameters for each of those engines and we can take many more but just with the basic parameters of exhaust gas temperature fuel flow in core speed we're able to just take measurements throughout the flight look at them trend them and understand the health of each and every engine just like you go to the doctor may take your temperature of blood pressure and they're a great indicator of how you're doing we trend that we learn about the engines when we segment them and then that allows us to advise our customers had it get more out of them how to fly them in ways in which they last longer and be able to predict how much life they have so you can schedule when they need to come over wing for me which saves them a lot of money and do you get advance warning of problems yeah they're one of the locomotives is this I get where the heavy of weight nature of what we're doing really matters taking in massive amounts of information and looking at maybe the one or two anomalies you're seeing you can start the postulate is that a trend we should be concerned about you know one of the things that's actually happened to our planet in the last 10 to 15 years is something called the dust belt we have these particulate matter in the atmosphere in certain parts or the engines that fly through that don't last quite as long as on the ones that don't fly through it so we're able to spot those trends much earlier and be able to treat the engines before any real problems are honored one of the concepts and rain that we talked about on is the the advantage of having no unplanned downtime and if you're operating in industry unfound unplanned downtime is a bad thing that's kind of your animate right so a lot of what we're trying to drive with the industrial internet you know we talked about GE is a digital industrial company is to help our customers manage their their their downtime their assets and the amount of time that they're operational in a much more efficient way and so is this something that folks who fly just about all of us can look forward to in fewer delays fewer surprises fewer notification with the cockpit oh we've just discovered that the engine is broken and we need the TV team to come fix it right we've all probably been on playing at least once if you fly a lot and all of a sudden just about the time you think you're leaving the gate the pilot comes on and tells you they got a light on or something you know this is going to reduce the number of times that happens tremendously on and you know how it affects consumers right um you know it will lower their fuel consumption for instance right so should be able to offer more competitive pricing on on tickets and Linda you mentioned it to build out this business and incorporated in everything that she does you actually opened a huge new division in Silicon Valley you had an advertisement that went along with it that everybody like where the engineer announces to his friends that he works for GE and it's not why would you ever do that while it's actually exciting and I work on trains and thinks how important is that piece of it I mean are we now going to expect airlines to know how to interpret all this data are you doing that for them well i would say in you know rusty old jump in here you know I think for GE we're 124 years old 124 year old stored up if you will and people know us well they think of us a certain way I think as we have added this whole layer of analytics predictive analytics data having the public if you will from a brand point of view think of us as a company that is this hybrid of digital and industrial is important talent is a big piece of that so the fun campaign you referred to this idea of a developer sort of telling his perplexed friends that he now works for GE well it's light and it's marketing there's a there's a truth to it which is we are now bringing hundreds now thousands of people to work for GE in a completely new capacity and that leads to a new type of behavior I mean rusty you might talk a little bit about what you do is in the digital twin because that's a piece of this sure but you know in to the point to about you know our starting up a brand new division of GE GE digital based in San monona yes we had a ghost somewhere and really dip into that ecosystem and find the digital talent what makes us so powerful in this is that we've married it with our legacy industrial know how you know the deep physics knowledge that we have about these machines and when you put these things together it's a very powerful thing so one of the work on one of our killer apps built on top of the industrial internet there's something we call the digital twin so for every one of these aircraft engines or local motors that we make will also have its digital torn think of it as the you know medical record of that asset so we track it as it goes through its lifecycle from when it was built and commissioned to how it operates and again using the data that we get off of that and the physics models that we have developed about that we can have very unique insights nobody else is able to calculate again to tell how to get more out of the asset and again reduce that down time and how is how unusual is what you're doing relative everybody else because from the outside listening to lots of big manufacturing companies so that everyone's talking about digital as the next thing cloud cloud cloud is what you're doing where is it in the competitive so you know there are very few companies in fact I think we're singular in this way that have the domain expertise right we know industry we have been an industry for over a century we're taking that knowledge of industry and adding the data component and frankly Henry we're trying it on ourselves I mean the first several years of industrial Internet has been GE applying the technology that rusty and I are talking about to our own factories and our own machines it's kind of rare in this world that somebody with our type of expertise can add that layer sort of practice it on ourselves before we introduce it to customers so you know we think of it as sort of a you know our industrial superpowers meeting data and analytics you know you know I really look at it as we've been doing lots of this for over 30 years we have started to build medical monitoring and diagnostic centres decades ago where we do watch these assets with the data we were able to collect now we have more sensors more data more know how about what to do with it again the the capacity though that you get from cloud computing allows us to do this at a completely different scale so we think what really makes us much more unique than anybody else doing that is the fact that we've built a whole platform fall for it called predicts right this is GES industrial internet platform sometimes we call you know the operating system for industry you know so when you build industrial apps we want people to build them on critics we're doing it for ourselves and we're offering it to the world in fact Microsoft I think this morning is making an announcement they'll be using pre X so you know we are seeing an uptick in adoption to have an operating system and operating system of industry is a great way to say it that is super strong you know we sort of say industrial strength strength that can hold literally petabytes of data that has you know cyber security as sort of a number one feature you know we take so seriously I mean you talked about jet engines before on this is data that has to be ironclad secure so we think we've sort of have the right to do it we have the knowledge and we've been practicing it ourselves and you've talked about this being a 10 year plan to build that change GE and go forward we're in year three or four where are we in ten years what does it look like not just for GE but for the machines themselves I mean what's that future look like it's an interesting landscape to sort of portray a little bit right well i think you know we move from where we are today we have already built 35,000 twins of our assets and i imagine you know in that you know the times family meeting to full realization will be millions and millions of people with digital kings built without technology to track their assets and there'll be a whole you know continuum of will build some of them for them we'll offer our digital twin and predicts a capability as a platform as a service so depending on your level of sophistication as a developer you can do it yourself or we can you can unless the for you and as many options of how it's hosted but I think just like we saw on the web right we never imagined the number of cell phones right I think this will go way beyond the wildest dreams this in the first you know four or so years of doing this we've hit every metric we set out for ourselves and when we started they might have looked a little crazy to us but we're doing it and I'm confident we'll get all the way to the ankle and have you been able to do things for customers that you didn't foresee in the beginning because if you look at the iphone for example when this was first introduced everyone made all these crazy predictions and it turned out they weren't anywhere near crazy enough and all these things have been created that nobody imagined them well I think if I can jump in on this one I think what's really interesting is just in some ways like iOS and and like the Apple phone you know predicts is a platform and we expect you know maybe ten twenty thousand developers this year to be building apps on predicts so you know we've got four or five thousand already and I think that's where the flywheel starts to starts to happen right a great platform developers industrial developers looking at this and saying wow I can apply what i know and create industrial solutions so i think that's going to start to you know make a big difference as the apps come online i mean there are predictions that the industrial internet will be bigger than the consumer internet hard to believe just data but in terms of data in terms of the size of the market and frankly in terms of the impact we talk about marketing let's talk about marketing the chief marketing all most innovative marketing companies so stepping back yeah well this 10 year period five years ago 25 years in the future yeah can you give us a sense of what's happening to GES marketing and add budget yeah so look I think we try Henry and you know you and I have had this conversation at various points to market in the year we live at we don't sort of pine for the good old days when there were three networks and it was easy to reach people what we try to do in marketing is to get the best possible content message out where people are spending their time and as a result you know do people still watch television you bet they do however in our opinion where we might place advertising is a lot different than it used to be because of binge watching because of DVR so we've shifted most of our television ad spent to be during live programming sunday night football is a good example of that and our digital spend is just increasing percentage wise and you know when you have something like Facebook and I'm not going to make this a Facebook commercial but you know Facebook is the most efficient place to reach people on it's as much a performance channel as it is a social channel Google's really efficient and then you know us we love to experiment you know we've experimented as a company and as a business all the way back to Edison so we continue that spirit of experimenting when it comes to our marketing and that might be on doing a podcast which we did last fall that was terrific called the message or VR or just being on an emerging platforms so as I think about marketing and trends those are those are a couple that come to my facebooks made no secret of its desire to capture a huge percentage of television dollars here we are talking funnily in our area what's the unit when you buy when you replace television and on your facebook what's the unit so that's a great question on I think of the unit as a tension right so we all want attention and I think when there were three networks for networks you got attention simply by being on friends or cheers or something like that on as we all strive for attention attention I think is more and more in people's feeds think about the amount of time that we're on our phones and think about where we are on our phones you know research shows fewer and fewer apps are being used the apps that are used are frequently ones Facebook Linkedin etc where you're putting videos hopefully people are watching us right now on Facebook live in stream but I think despite all the metrics available to you know cider to GE the the most important one is our people actually engaging with us that's the unit i want to buy what are you producing to do that and to be very specific sir there's been a lot written about basically add tea people are ya have especially the younger generations don't like ads so one thing that's happening is this co-creation Yelp content yep you've been at the forefront of that you actually created a TV series i think with National Geographic dead so what did what is the ad unit look like of the future is going to be a 30-second spot is it going to be a pre-roll which a lot of people don't like yes is it going to be something in which you are featured that is a story created by producer how do you like it I kind of think any and all of the above or possible but it comes back to is the quality high enough you know I talked off and again you and I have talked about this in the past you know you don't want to create content that is second fiddle you want to create something that is a really good story that can be six hours which is what we did with national geo it can be six seconds which we've done on vine it can be Instagram it can be a podcast and I tend to think the unit and now here where you're going on this can be integrated so when we did this podcast last fall on we were on very loosely part of the story very loosely but what we surrounded it with was this idea of the GE podcast theater and it's funny it kind of harkens back to the 50s where there was once upon a time the GE theater and there were soap operas brought to you by consumer packaged goods goods companies so sometimes it's creating a franchise and in some ways what we did with podcasting this one podcast what we did with nat geo was kind of a franchise position but make no mistake there are times when we will create something that looks and smells and behaves like an ad and if it's really good and i'll use what we talked about a few minutes ago because you brought it up so i don't feel so sheepish bringing it up this series we did on this young developer oh n was a great story it was sell deprecating it was funny and recruiting went up eight hundred percent so you know if you can find that bit of magic and it is a bit of magic right on you know that can be very powerful so I guess my long answer to your smart question is that the unit will vary but it will not be one single it's pre-roll it's not pretty roll on I think it's going to come in a lot of forms and formats so going back as the last question yeah one over the next five years yeah how do you see your spending shifting does it go to Facebook TV to Facebook is that the simple way to think about it well I I think that's it's that's almost too simple if you will more is going to facebook but or spend will go where people are spending their time and attention look if every single person in America was watching ABC we'd be on ABC but every single person isn't a billion and a half people are on Facebook and I think for any marketer that ignores where people are spending their time they're doing it at their own peril so our spend will shift as people's behavior shifts and digital is only going up so that's a really good harbinger for where our spend will go Linda rusty thank you very much thank you very much for joining us thanks and see you it's great there's a lot of fun thank you thanks everybody
