the main issue here is why the media have decided to highlight and spotlight these kids and the reason is because the kids can say things that the media can hide behind and so we're gonna go through some of the arguments that were being made by a lot of the kids at this at this rally because I think that it's important to look at the arguments not just at the speakers whether the media wants to see are the still photos of David hog with his arm outstretched on emma gonzales standing there silently and then we're supposed to say well anything these people choose to say must be right again I have nothing but sympathy for what they went through yeah I've sympathy for what Kyle cashew is a conservative student went through all these kids went through something but it doesn't mean their experiences confer any sort of expertise upon them okay so we start with David hog David hog has been the most ubiquitous member of the of the cadre of classmates he's been on virtually every TV show he's done Ellen he does CNN on a regular basis he does the sunday shows he doesn't know anything about guns he doesn't know much about gun control but he certainly knows how to demagogue and so for four minutes you'll hear him demagogue over and over and over in the most dramatic fashion yeah it's it's irritating to watch I understand particularly for people who are pro Second Amendment but it's important to know what what the propagandist in the media are doing with this kid because again the kid can speak out it's his it's his absolute right to speak out and obviously he can speak in front of any camera that he wants to speak in front of that's great but he can be criticized just like anyone else I know I was 17 I wrote a syndicated column I got criticized just like everybody else that's the wave free speech works in the country okay here is David Hogg we're gonna go through his full speech or as much of it as possible first off I'm gonna start off by putting this price tag right here as a reminder for you guys to know how much Marco Rubio took for every students life in Florida one dollar and five cents okay that is a live deposit right there again because that's a lie okay then the dollar and five cent thing is a slander against Marco Rubio it's disgusting by the way if you want to actually come to some sort of agreement about what we can do here you might want to start by talking to the senator from Florida who's actually proposed legislation with Bill Nelson on protecting schools this is not designed to help anybody this is designed a virtue signal and it's designed in order so the Democrats can feel better about themselves okay hog continues grass corruption shackles the District of Columbia the winter is over change is here the Sun shines on a new day and the day is ours let that mean to the freight first time voters show up eighteen percent of the time in midterm elections not anymore well I mean we don't know the stats that's out there's now who here is gonna vote in the 2018 election if you listen real close you can hear the people in power shaking well they've gotten used to being protective of their position chewing safety the safety of inaction inaction is no longer safe and to that we say no more okay pause it right there for one second okay I just want to point something out the generic ballot over the weekend close to about five points had been up to 12 I believe one of the reasons it's closing is because Republicans are looking at this kind of demagoguery and they're saying final thought and vote right before the question was would Republicans go out and vote in any significant numbers and there is no reason to think Republicans what it's an off-year election there's no real galvanizing issue you want to galvanize Republicans tell them that you're gonna take away their guns that they're evil people who want to murder children if they don't let you take away their guns you don't know why the gap that ballot gap is closing it's because every time the media decided to go on a crusade against Second Amendment rights they're a bunch of Americans say fine I'll finally get off my Duff and go vote okay so before David Hogg declares victory especially on the gun control issue you should recognize a couple of things one Democrats in power have not passed any gun control Barack Obama has zero gun control between 2009 and 2011 when you had full control of Congress and two Republicans are actually going to show up in broader numbers thanks to this sort of demagoguery than they would otherwise
