VOTE, PEOPLE ARE SURPRISED. HEATHER: DONALD TRUMP WILL RALLY AMERICANS TO GET OUT AND VOTE NEXT WEEK IN MINNESOTA. REPUBLICAN CONGRESSIONAL CANDIDATE CREDITING THE PRESIDENT AND HIS LAST-MINUTE ENDORSEMENT FOR BEATING OUT HER REPUBLICAN COUNTERPART. IN A TIGHT RACE KATIE ARRINGTON WINNING 50.6% OF THE VOTE AS MARK SANFORD LOSES HIS FIRST ELECTION EVER. REDUCED TO MORE TRUMP VERSUS NOT AND I LOST THAT RACE. MY OPPONENT SAID THIS MIGHT HER WORDS WERE THIS IS THE PARTY OF DONALD J TRUMP. I DON'T BELIEVE IT IS THE PARTY OF DONALD J TRUMP. IS YOUR CAREER OVER IN POLITICS? THAT WOULD BE MY TAKE. HEATHER: IS IT SAFE TO SAY VOTERS SIDE WITH THE PRESIDENT? HERE IS THE WOMAN WHO SECURED HER NAME ON THE NOVEMBER BALLOT, STATE REPRESENTATIVE AND CONGRESSIONAL CANDIDATE KATE BARRINGTON. THANKS FOR JOINING US, APPRECIATE IT. THANKS FOR HAVING ME. HEATHER: I LOVE THE VIDEO OF YOU, SO LEGITIMATELY EXCITED TO WIN. THAT WAS GREAT TO SEE. YOU ARE ALSO EXCITED ABOUT DONALD TRUMP AND HIS AGENDA MOVING FORWARD ABOUT THE FOLKS SAYING THAT IS KEY TO PEOPLE LIKE YOU RUNNING, THE SUPPORT OF DONALD TRUMP IS KEY. DO YOU AGREE WITH THAT? YES, I THINK THE FACT THAT WE THE PEOPLE ELECTED THE PRESIDENT. AS A PRESIDENT. AS A NO AND IF MY OPPONENT, MARK SANFORD, FEELS HE IS NOT TRUMP ENOUGH, I DON'T THINK HE GETS IT. IF YOU ARE NOT REPUBLICAN WE ARE CONSERVATIVE. WE WANT TO HAVE OUR CONSERVATIVE AGENDA IMPLEMENTED IN WASHINGTON AND IT IS SOMETHING WE ARE INTENT ON DOING. HAVE A TWEET FROM THE PRESIDENT CAME OUT AT 4:00 PM. A GOOD SHARE OF VOTERS HAD ALREADY GONE TO THE POLLS. THE PRESIDENT GETTING INVOLVED, COMING OUT THAT LATE WAS POSITIVE, SENT MORE PEOPLE TO THE POLLS TO REMEMBER IF WE WANT TO CHANGE, IF WE WANT OUR VOICES HEARD IN WASHINGTON WE NEED TO VOTE AND EXERCISE THAT RIGHT. HEATHER: LOOK AT THAT WE YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT. THIS IS THE ONE THAT CAME IN LAST MINUTE, MARK SANFORD HAS BEEN VERY UNHELPFUL TO ME IN MY CAMPAIGN TO MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN, HIS NOTHING BUT TROUBLE, BETTER OFF IN ARGENTINA, I ENDORSE KATIE ARRINGTON, TOUGH ON CRIME, WE WILL CONTINUE OUR FIGHT TO LOWER TAXES, VOTE KATIE. AND THE REFERENCE TO ARGENTINA, A REFERENCE TO THE PERSONAL ISSUES SANFORD HAD IN SOUTH CAROLINA. HE HAS A LOT OF THINGS GOING ON WITH HIM BUT DONALD TRUMP DOUBLED DOWN ON IT YESTERDAY, MY POLITICAL REPRESENTATIVES DIDN'T WANT ME TO GET INVOLVED IN THE PRIMARY, THAT SANFORD WOULD EASILY WIN BUT FOR THE FEW HOURS LEFT I FELT KATIE WAS SUCH A GOOD CANDIDATE AND SANFORD WAS SO GOOD HAD TO GIVE IT A SHOT, CONGRATULATIONS TO KATIE ARRINGTON AND PERHAPS THAT PUSHED YOU OVER THE EDGE AND MADE YOU WIN BUT ALSO YOU HAVE A SIGNIFICANT BACKGROUND. PEOPLE SAY YOU ARE A NEWCOMER TO POLITICS, 2016 YOU BECAME STATE REPRESENTATIVE. ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF SOMEONE WHO IS NOT A CAREER ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF SOMEONE WHO IS NOT A CAREER POLITICIAN, HAD REAL-WORLD EXPERIENCE. ABSOLUTELY. THAT WAS RESOUNDING. WE SENT A BUSINESSMAN TO WASHINGTON BECAUSE WE WERE TIRED OF CAREER POLITICIANS IN WASHINGTON, TIRED OF NOT GETTING RESULTS. I WENT TO THE STATEHOUSE IN TWO I WENT TO THE STATEHOUSE IN TWO YEARS, I SHOOK IT UP. THAT IS WHAT WE ARE SUPPOSED TO DO, GET WHAT WE NEED DONE FOR OUR CONSTITUENTS. I'M INTENT ON DOING THAT IN WASHINGTON. I WILL HE GO EIGHT YEARS, FOUR TERMS, IF MY CONSTITUENTS BRING ME BACK EVERY TWO YEARS, AND THAT IS PART OF THE PROBLEM IN THE CAREER POLITICIANS, THE POLITICAL ELITE, THEY FEEL SOMEHOW THEY ARE ENTITLED TO THESE POSITIONS AND THINGS WE NEED TO WORK HARD FOR EVERY TWO YEARS. THAT IS WHY THE HOUSE, THE WORKFORCE OF THE LEGISLATIVE BODY, THAT IS ONE THING I PLAN TO ENCOMPASS AND BE FOR THE NEXT TWO YEARS AT A MINIMUM. A LOT OF WORK BETWEEN NOW AND NOVEMBER, BUT DONALD TRUMP'S CONSERVATIVE AGENDA IS SOMETHING THAT RESOUNDS WITH THE REPUBLICAN PARTY IN SOUTH CAROLINA. JILLIAN: HIS SUCCESSES WE HEARD THE PRESIDENT TALKING ABOUT, THE ECONOMY, THE LATEST SUMMIT WITH
