SOON.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
>> WE HAVE TIME FOR TWO
QUESTIONS TOTAL.
THE FIRST GOES TO FOX NEWS.
>> THANK YOU, MR. SECRETARY.
YOU JUST MENTIONED AND HAVE
MENTIONED BEFORE THAT YOU ARE
LOOKING FOR PERMANENT,
VERIFIABLE, IRREVERSIBLE NEW
DENUCLEARIZATION.
HOW DOES THE UNITED STATES
DEFINED THAT?
IS IT INSPECTIONS, A FULL
FACILITY DISMANTLING, MORE OR
LESS THAN THAT?
AND YOU HAVE HAD MORE SUBSEQUENT
CONVERSATIONS WITH KIM JONG UN
THEN ANY OTHER WESTERNER.
WHAT IS YOUR IMPRESSION OF HIM?
IS HE RATIONAL, WHAT'S IT LIKE
TO TALK TO HIM?
AND TO THE FOREIGN MINISTER, ARE
THERE ANY SANCTIONS OR RELIEF TO
NORTH KOREA BEFORE THE SUMMIT
BETWEEN RESIDENT TRUMPET AND A
KIM JONG UN?
WHAT KIND OF OUTCOME DOES
SOUTH KOREA NEED TO SECURE ITS
SECURITY AND DOES NOT INCLUDE
THE MAINTENANCE OF CURRENT U.S.
MILITARY ASSETS IN THE REGION.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
>> I HAVE SPENT MORE TIME WITH
CHAIRMAN KIM, OTHER THAN PERHAPS
PRESIDENT MOON, WORKING ON THIS
INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT CHALLENGE
THAT LAYS BEFORE THE WORLD.
PRESIDENT TRUMP AND THE WORLD
WHO SET THE CONDITIONS FOR A
SUCCESSFUL OUTCOME FROM
JUNE 12TH AND THE ACTIVITIES
THAT ARE NECESSARY TO FOLLOW
THERE FROM.
YOU ASKED ABOUT MY CONVERSATIONS
WITH CHAIRMAN KIM, THIS QUESTION
IS SORT OF UNDIGNIFIED, AND THE
CONVERSATIONS INVOLVED DEEP
COMPLEX PROBLEMS, CHALLENGES AND
THE STRATEGIC DECISION THAT THE
CHAIRMAN HAS BEFORE HIM ABOUT
HOW IT IS HE WISHES TO PROCEED,
AND IF HE IS PREPARED IN
EXCHANGE FOR THE ASSURANCES THAT
WE ARE READY TO PROVIDE TO HIM,
IF HE IS PREPARED TO FULLY
DENUCLEARIZE.
AND, THEY TOOK THAT TIME TO
ENSURE THAT WE DIDN'T END UP IN
THE SAME PLACE THAT WE DID
BEFORE.
AND NOT ONLY THE UNITED STATES
BUT THE WORLD WITH NUCLEAR
WEAPONS.
IN ORDER TO ACHIEVE THAT, IT
WILL REQUIRE A ROBUST
CLARIFICATION PROGRAM, AND ONE
THAT WE WILL UNDERTAKE WITH
PARTNERS AROUND THE WORLD, WHICH
WILL ACHIEVE OUTCOME IN A WAY
THAT FRANKLY NO AGREEMENT FOR
THEM IS SET FORTH.
WE HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO HAVE A
GOOD SOUND DISCUSSION SO I THINK
WE HAVE A PRETTY GOOD
UNDERSTANDING BETWEEN OUR TWO
COUNTRIES ABOUT WHAT THE SHARED
OBJECTIVES ARE.
THERE ARE SOME VIDEOS THAT HAVE
BEEN RELEASED.
OUR CONVERSATIONS WERE WARM.
WE WERE EACH REPRESENTING OUR
TWO COUNTRIES MAKING SURE THAT
WE WERE TRYING OUR BEST, AND WE
HAD GOOD CONVERSATIONS ABOUT THE
HISTORY OF OUR TWO NATIONS AND
THE CHALLENGES THAT WE HAD
BETWEEN US.
