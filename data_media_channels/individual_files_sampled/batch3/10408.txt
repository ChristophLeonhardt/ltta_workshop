I never sorrow at the moment of the bombardment the rocket landed and the whole world turned red and I felt that I was turning in the air many were killed by shrapnel there were some victims who were torn in half others were injured in the stomach head neck hands or legs my cousin died and other relatives were injured I came to see the wedding I was looking at people dancing and then the missile came I was hitting my leg but shrapnel from the rocket we went to the wedding and suddenly during the celebration the strike came we didn't have anything there no weapons no nothing I lost a foot the same happened to my brother my other brother died because of the bombing we tried to flee but could not walk we had to wait until ambulances came and got us a dozen of the wounded are in a critical condition we've asked the saudi-led coalition for comment on their investigation into the strike so far they've chosen not to respond the saudi-led coalition launched its military intervention in Yemen back in 2050 in order to fight Houthi rebels who overrun large swathes of territory in the north of the country however Riyadh says it does not target civilians since the start of the air its air campaign the coalition has run a number of its own investigations into air strikes that have led to mass casualties as human rights continue to call on Saudi Arabia to end the conflict
