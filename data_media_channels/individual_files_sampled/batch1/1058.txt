the beaches of guaruja have long been a holiday getaway for people living in brazil's financial capital Sao Paulo but lately it's become well-known for another reason it's the focus of the corruption accusations against former President Luiz in√°cio Lula da Silva everyone says this is Lola's apartment I think that Lula as a former president of Brazil he should have been the most correct of all if he bought it and gave up on the apartment as he lawyers say he should have a document informing that I think he's guilty he must pay for his mistakes editing the former president was sentenced to nine and a half years in prison a decision on his appeal is due this Wednesday Lula was convicted of accepting over a million dollars in bribes from a construction company prosecutors say that that money was used to buy and to renovate that luxury trip flex on top of that building they also say that in return Lula helped that company win contracts with a state oil company Petrobras but many say there is not enough proof to condemn him because the triplex continues to be registered under the construction company's name that's why people like Anderson Sousa dos Santos continue to support him Lula supports the workers those who are working hard every day I will vote for Lula for sure people are harrassing him to stop him returning to the presidency but we the Brazilian people should compare what Lula did for us and what the current president Michel temer has done to us that's my impression Brazil is heading to the polls to elect a new president in October and Lula continues to beat this country's most popular politician he was president for eight years after 2010 he supporters continue to see him as a champion of the poor Lula who is now 72 is facing six other investigations he's not only fighting back but has also announced he's planning to run for president again and last month being was nowadays we don't have a candidate who offers a project a proposal that gets the Elektra involved we were dragged to a severe economic crisis and what the population can see is that social and economic conditions deteriorated significantly this year LULAC would end up behind bars or elected president what certain is the accusations against him have not been able to disillusion those who want him in power again Barry Sabo al Jazeera Raja Brazil
