♪♪ STEVE: 8:33 HERE IN NEW YORK CITY. BACK WITH A FOX NEWS ALERT. A TEENAGER IS UNDER ARREST AT THIS HOUR IN CONNECTION TO THE MURDER OF A BALTIMORE POLICE OFFICER. HIS NAME AND HIS CHARGES WILL BE RELEASED AFTER HIS BAIL HEARING LATER TODAY. HE WAS ARRESTED YESTERDAY BUT POLICE ARE JUST NOW ANNOUNCING IT. A MANHUNT IS NOW UNDERWAY INTENSIFYING FOR THREE OTHER SUSPECTS CONSIDERED ARMED AND DANGEROUS. BRIAN: ACCORDING TO THE BALTIMORE COUNTY POLICE CHIEF THE FEMALE OFFICER WAS RESPONDING TO A POSSIBLE BURGLARY WHEN WITNESSES SAY SHE WAS RUN OVER BY A JEEP. AINSLEY: WOW, THIS MARKS THE 26th OFFICER KILLED ON THE JOB THIS YEAR. 26 SO FAR. LET'S BRING IN DANA LOESCH, A NATIONALLY SYNDICATED AID ROW TALK SHOW HOST, THE DANA SHOW AND NRA SPOKESPERSON. WHAT IS YOUR REACTION? I'M JUST NOW SEEING WHAT YOU'RE SEEING THIS IS ABSOLUTELY AWFUL WE SEE SOMETHING LIKE THIS. THAT IS ONE OF THE REASONS WE BACK THE BLUE. THE MEN AND WOMEN IN UNIFORM GO THROUGH EVERY SINGLE TIME THEY PUT ON A BADGE AND A UNIFORM. IT'S A DANGEROUS JOB AND GETTING MORE DANGEROUS FOR LAW ENFORCEMENT. STEVE: INDEED. THAT IS THE SENTIMENT OF THE POLICE CHIEF IN THE BALTIMORE AREA. LISTEN TO THIS, DANA. IT'S A TERRIBLE, WE'RE SEEING SOMETHING IN THIS COUNTRY TODAY WE'VE NEVER SEEN BEFORE. WE'RE SEEING POLICE OFFICERS ASSAULTED. THE NUMBER OF OFFICERS WHO HAVE DIED IN THE LINE OF DUTY IS UP THIS YEAR. THE OFFICERS WHO DIED AT THE HAND OF GUNSHOTS IS UP. AND SO WE'RE TELLING EVERYBODY, BE ON YOUR TOES. DON'T BE COMPLACENT. WORK WITH EACH OTHER. THIS IS A BAD TIME IN THE UNITED STATES FOR LAW ENFORCEMENT AND THE ATTACKS THAT ARE OCCURRING. BRIAN: IF YOU WANT TO KNOW HOW BAD IT IS GETTING, AT THIS TIME LAST YEAR, 15 OFFICERS HAD LOST THEIR LIVES. NOW IT IS UP TO 26. LAST YEAR IT CAPPED OUT AT 35. SADLY LOOKS LIKE WE'LL GET WAY PAST THAT BEFORE THE SUMMER STARTS. YOU WONDER IF THIS IS AN ATTITUDE IN AMERICA TODAY? YEAH, I AGREE WITH YOU, BRIAN. I THINK THERE IS SOMETHING THERE TO THAT. I KNOW THERE IS A GENERAL LACK OF RESPECT FOR EACH OTHER AND AUTHORITY AND MAKING SURE THAT WE ALL LIVE NICELY AND IN HARMONY WITH EVERYBODY BUT AT THE SAME TIME WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT I THINK IT IS TRENDY TO HATE COPS RIGHT NOW. I HONESTLY DO. I THINK IT IS TRENDY TO HATE COPS AND TRENDY TO BASH COPS. A LOT OF PEOPLE THINK IT IS EASY TO SUNDAY MORNING QUARTER A COP'S DECISION THROUGH THE KEYBOARD IN PARTICULAR THEY DON'T HAVE ANY LAW ENFORCEMENT TRAINING. GOVERNOR OF TEXAS, GREG ABBOTT WILL HOLD A ROUNDTABLE DISCUSSION, THREE DAYS OF ROUNDTABLE DISCUSSIONS TO SPEED UP SECURITY IN STATE. KEEP GUNS AWAY FROM THOSE WHO POSE IMMEDIATE DANGER. HE WANTS MORE RESOURCES FOR SCHOOL SAFETY PERSONNEL, AND HE WANTS TO ADDRESS MENTAL ILLNESS ISSUES TIEDED TO GUN VIOLENCE. WHAT ARE YOUR THOUGHTS, DANA? AINSLEY, THESE ARE ALL ISSUES I HAVE TALKED ABOUT FOR' HAVE, VERY LONG TIME, SINCE THE NOW INFAMOUS TOWN HALL WHEN THOSE SUGGESTIONS WERE ROUNDLY BOOED. WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT THE SCHOOL SHIELD PROGRAM. I HOPE THAT SCHOOLS ACROSS THE COUNTRY REALIZE THAT THESE RESOURCES ARE AVAILABLE TO THEM. IF I CAN MAKE ONE QUICK POINT. EVERY ONE WHO HAS CHILDREN IN SCHOOLS NEED TO REALIZE RIGHT NOW. THEY NEED TO REALIZE THIS HAPPENED IN BROWARD COUNTY. I TALKED TO PEOPLE IN BROWARD COUNTY AT MARJORY STONEMAN DOUGLAS SCHOOL. THEY HAD A SECRET SERVICE MEMBER DO RISK AS SENTIMENT. NONE OF THOSE THINGS WERE PUT INTO PLACE. A PROMISED PROGRAM THAT DIDN'T REPORT CRIMINALITY OF STUDENTS AND PREVENT AD RECORD FROM BEING ESTABLISHED FOR THE MURDERER. HE COULD HAVE BEEN RENDERED A PROHIBITED POSSESSOR. PARENTS NEED TO MAKE SURE THESE PROGRAMS ARE NOW IN THEIR KIDS SCHOOLS. HOW ABOUT TAKE HALF A BILLION DOLLARS PLANNED PARENTHOOD AND REDIRECT THAT TO MAKE SURE SCHOOLS ARE SECURED AND ARMED SECURITY AND METAL DETECTORS. WE PROTECT OUR SPORTING EVENTS AND CONCERTS MORE. STEVE: AS AN NRA SPOKESPERSON OVER THE LAST COUPLE MONTHS WE'VE BEEN HEARING MORE AND MORE, INCLUDING THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES TALKING ABOUT WE SHOULD BE ARMING OUR TEACHERS. IN FACT THAT IS ONE OF THE THINGS THAT GREG ABBOTT IS GOING TO BE TALKING ABOUT, GOVERNOR ABBOTT THERE IN YOUR STATE TODAY. YES. AND I THINK IF TEACHERS AND PARENTS DETERMINE FOR THEIR, EACH FOR THEIR SCHOOL DISTRICT THAT THIS IS SOMETHING THAT THEY BAN TO IMPLEMENT AND TEACHERS VOLUNTEERED, THEY'RE WILLING TO TRAIN AND WILLING TO CARRY TEACH REMEMBERS INCREDIBLY TALENTED PEOPLE. I DON'T THINK THEY GET THE CREDIT THEY DESERVE. THEY CAN TEACH THEIR STUDENTS AND DEFEND THEIR OWN LIVES. IF HEAVEN FORBIDS ALL ELSE FAILS, DEFEND THE LIVES OF STUDENTS IF WE HAVE ARMED RESOURCE OFFICERS, DO WHAT DAN PATRICK WAS DISCUSSING MAKE SURE WE'RE WATCHING ACCESS POINTS AND EXIT POINTS. THAT OUR SCHOOLS, PERIMETERS ARE SAFE, DOUBLE LOCKING DOORS. THIS IS MULTILAYER THING. NOT A LOT OF PEOPLE REALIZE THAT. THAT IS WHAT PATRICK IS DISCUSSING. THAT IS WHAT GREG ABBOTT IS DISCUSSING. I THINK IT IS THE LEAST WE CAN DO WITH OUR CHILDREN AND TEACHERS. BRIAN: THOUSAND OF SCHOOLS, STATES, HEALTHY LIKE FLORIDA, ARE ACTIVE TRAINING GUARDIANS WITH HUNDREDS OF HOURS. BUT STATES ARE HURTING THAT IS MAYBE WHERE THE FEDERAL
