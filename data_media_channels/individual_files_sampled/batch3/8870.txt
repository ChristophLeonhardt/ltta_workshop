INSPECTOR GENERAL'S REPORT THAT THAT DATE COULD FLIP. Shannon: WILL WAIT AND SEE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. RUDY GIULIANI SAYS THE SPECIAL PROSECUTOR'S TEAM IS TRYING TO FRAME THE PRESIDENT. GIULIANI MADE THE COMMENT ABOUT ROBERT MUELLER DURING AN INTERVIEW IN ISRAEL. A GROUP OF 13 HIGHLY PARTISAN DEMOCRATS THAT MAKE UP THE MUELLER TEAM, EXCLUDING HIM, ARE TRYING VERY, VERY HARD TO FRAME HIM. TO GET HIM IN TROUBLE WHEN HE HASN'T DONE ANYTHING WRONG. Shannon: GIULIANI SAYS THE MUELLER TEAM CANNOT COME TO GRIPS WITH THE FACT THAT COLLUSION DID NOT HAPPEN. MEMBERS OF THE U.S. HOUSE CAN GO AHEAD WITH THEIR SUMMER VACATION PLANS. THE HOUSE MAJORITY LEADER SAYS THE AUGUST RECESS IS STILL ON. EVEN AS SENATORS PLAN TO WORK THROUGH MOST OF IT. EXACTLY WHAT THOSE SENATORS WILL BE WORKING ON, THAT IS STILL UNDECIDED. HERE IS CHIEF CONGRESSIONAL CORRESPONDENT MIKE EMANUEL. MAJORITY LEADER. MITCH MCCONNELL MAY HAVE BOUGHT HIMSELF MORE TIME TO CHECK SOME ITEMS OFF HIS LIST OF PRIORITIES. WE NEED TO CONFIRM MORE OF THE PRESIDENTS TEAM AND JUDICIAL NOMINEES. WE NEED TO TAKE UP REGULAR APPROPRIATION BILLS. WE NEED TO TACKLE LEGISLATIVE PRIORITIES LIKE THE WATER AND FOR STRUCTURE BILL, THE FARM BILL, DEFENSE BILL AND MANY OTHERS. THE SENATE WILL REMAIN IN SESSION. ONE G.O.P. SENATOR HAS A PRIORITY OF HIS OWN. KEEPING PRESIDENT TRUMP'S TRADE POLICIES IN CHECK. BECAUSE THEY ARE UTILIZING IT IN THIS UNPRECEDENTED WAY, WE HAVE ASKED, HOW CAN YOU CONTINUE THE THINGS. ONCE YOU COMPLETE THE WORK, YOU HAVE TO SUBMIT A TEST FOR APPROVAL BECAUSE TARIFFS AND REVENUES ARE THE RESPONSIBILITIES OF CONGRESS, NOT THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH. DEMOCRATIC LEADER TIPPED HIS HAT ON HOW HE WANTS TO SPEND AUGUST NOW THAT THE SENATE IS IN SESSION. WHY DON'T WE GET SOMETHING DONE ON THE ISSUE THAT NUMEROUS POLLS SAY IS THE NUMBER ONE PRIORITY OF AMERICANS? HEALTH CARE. WE DEMOCRATS, OUR ENTIRE CAUCUS, BELIEVES THIS PREVIOUSLY ON SCHEDULED SESSION TIME CAN BE PUT TO GOOD USE. PRESIDENT TRUMP APPLAUDED McCONNELL'S CALL, SAYING "GREAT. MAYBE THE DEMOCRATS WILL FINALLY GET SOMETHING DONE OTHER THAN THEIR ACCEPTANCE OF HIGH CRIME AND HIGH TAXES." HIS PRAISE MAY HAVE FALLEN ON DEAF EARS WITH KEVIN McCARTHY WHO SAID HE HAS NO PLANS TO KEEP THE HOUSE OPEN, TELLING REPORTERS I UNDERSTAND WHY THE SENATE NEEDS TO FINISH THEIR WORK. WE HAVE BEEN DOING OUR WORK. THE MAN WHOSE JOB McCARTHY IS EYEING WANTS TO THREAD THE NEEDLE ON THE ISSUE THAT THREATENS TO DERAIL THE G.O.P. I FEEL GOOD ABOUT THE KIND OF CONVERSATIONS WE ARE HAVING. OUR MEMBERS ARE EARNEST AND SINCERE IN TRYING TO UNDERSTAND EACH OTHER'S PERSPECTIVES. WE HAVE A BIG, BIG SWAP OF VIEWS IN THE CONFERENCE. I DO BELIEVE THERE'S A SWEET SPOT. TO BE CLEAR, McCARTHY IS NOT ATTACKING McCONNELL. HE'S NOTING THAT THE HOUSE THIS PAST HUNDREDS MORE BILLS, AND HE BLAMES SENATE DEMOCRATS FOR OBSTRUCTION. WITH SOME ITEMS ON THE TO-DO LIST CONTROVERSIAL, IT MIGHT
