1
00:00:00,207 --> 00:00:01,442
FRONT LINES.

2
00:00:01,442 --> 00:00:02,843
BUT FIRST, ROSANNE AND THE RACE

3
00:00:02,843 --> 00:00:04,043
TO BLAME TRUMP.

4
00:00:04,043 --> 00:00:07,448
THAT'S THE FOCUS OF TONIGHT'S

5
00:00:07,448 --> 00:00:13,621
ANGLE.

6
00:00:13,621 --> 00:00:16,323
WOULDN'T YOU KNOW IT, WE SOLVED

7
00:00:16,323 --> 00:00:18,025
A TWITTER MYSTERY.

8
00:00:18,025 --> 00:00:19,493
WELL DONALD TRUMP HIMSELF MAY

9
00:00:19,493 --> 00:00:20,828
HAVE WELL TAKEN POSSESSION OF

10
00:00:20,828 --> 00:00:21,662
ROSEANNE BARR'S ACCOUNT AND IT

11
00:00:21,662 --> 00:00:23,497
TAPPED OUT THE TWEET THAT LED TO

12
00:00:23,497 --> 00:00:27,234
THE DEMISE OF HER HIT SITCOM AND

13
00:00:27,234 --> 00:00:29,036
HER ENTIRE CAREER.

14
00:00:29,036 --> 00:00:29,503
LISTEN CLOSELY.

15
00:00:29,503 --> 00:00:32,039
ALL ROADS LEAD BACK TO TRUMP.

16
00:00:32,039 --> 00:00:34,041
>> WE KNOW WHAT DONALD TRUMP

17
00:00:34,041 --> 00:00:34,608
THINKS.

18
00:00:34,608 --> 00:00:36,644
WE KNOW WHAT ROSEANNE BARR

19
00:00:36,644 --> 00:00:37,178
THINKS.

20
00:00:37,178 --> 00:00:40,447
IT'S TIME FOR US TO STOP PLAYING

21
00:00:40,447 --> 00:00:46,187
AROUND WITH SOFT WORDS, BY

22
00:00:46,187 --> 00:00:49,023
SAYING OH, WELL, THEY ARE SAYING

23
00:00:49,023 --> 00:00:50,624
INSENSITIVE THINGS.

24
00:00:50,624 --> 00:00:52,626
NO, IT'S RACIST.

25
00:00:52,626 --> 00:00:53,527
THEY ARE EXHIBITING RACIST

26
00:00:53,527 --> 00:00:54,028
BEHAVIOR.

27
00:00:54,028 --> 00:00:54,695
>> I'M NOT SOMEONE WHO HAS

28
00:00:54,695 --> 00:00:57,498
TRUMPS ARRANGEMENT SYNDROME AND

29
00:00:57,498 --> 00:00:58,499
BLAMES DONALD TRUMP FOR

30
00:00:58,499 --> 00:01:00,401
EVERYTHING BUT, THIS RIGHT HERE

31
00:01:00,401 --> 00:01:01,835
IS A DIRECT BYPRODUCT OF HOW

32
00:01:01,835 --> 00:01:03,904
DONALD TRUMP BEHAVES.

33
00:01:03,904 --> 00:01:06,440
>> THE THING THAT A SORT OF THE

34
00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:07,141
BACKGROUND OF ALL OF THIS IS

35
00:01:07,141 --> 00:01:09,009
THAT THE PRESIDENT CAN BE

36
00:01:09,009 --> 00:01:11,078
RACIST, AND NOTHING HAPPENED TO

37
00:01:11,078 --> 00:01:11,679
HIM.

38
00:01:11,679 --> 00:01:13,547
>> Laura: SO NOW THEY DO

39
00:01:13,547 --> 00:01:17,618
BELIEVE IN GUILT BY ASSOCIATION.

40
00:01:17,618 --> 00:01:19,520
WELL, THEY DIDN'T SUBSCRIBE TO

41
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:21,822
THIS BELIEF WHEN THIS HAPPENED.

42
00:01:21,822 --> 00:01:25,826
>> NO NO NO.

43
00:01:25,826 --> 00:01:27,194
GOD BLESS AMERICA.

44
00:01:27,194 --> 00:01:28,229
AMERICA.

45
00:01:28,229 --> 00:01:30,464
THAT'S IN THE BIBLE FOR KILLING

46
00:01:30,464 --> 00:01:33,634
INNOCENT PEOPLE.

47
00:01:33,634 --> 00:01:36,237
>> Laura: EVEN THOUGH

48
00:01:36,237 --> 00:01:38,038
PRESIDENT OBAMA SAT IN JEREMIAH

49
00:01:38,038 --> 00:01:40,074
WRIGHT'S P WAS YEARS MARINATING

50
00:01:40,074 --> 00:01:43,210
IN THAT HATE, WE WERE TOLD THAT

51
00:01:43,210 --> 00:01:45,212
HIS COMMENTS WERE NOT

52
00:01:45,212 --> 00:01:46,814
REPRESENTATIVE OF OBAMA'S OWN

53
00:01:46,814 --> 00:01:47,147
BELIEFS.

54
00:01:47,147 --> 00:01:49,283
THIS, DESPITE THE FACT THAT,

55
00:01:49,283 --> 00:01:51,885
UNLIKE TRUMP AND ROSEANNE, THE

56
00:01:51,885 --> 00:01:54,421
OBAMA'S WERE CLOSE TO RIGHT.

57
00:01:54,421 --> 00:01:56,757
HE WAS THE PRESIDENT'S SPIRITUAL

58
00:01:56,757 --> 00:01:58,659
MENTOR FOR YEARS.

59
00:01:58,659 --> 00:02:01,428
AND WHO CAN FORGET THIS 2005 JIM

60
00:02:01,428 --> 00:02:02,329
WHICH WAS CONVENIENTLY HIDDEN

61
00:02:02,329 --> 00:02:04,698
FROM PUBLIC VIEW BY THE

62
00:02:04,698 --> 00:02:06,667
PHOTOGRAPHER FOR YEARS.

63
00:02:06,667 --> 00:02:08,301
THAT'S A BUTTE.

64
00:02:08,301 --> 00:02:09,637
WELL, WE NEVER SAW THAT PICK

65
00:02:09,637 --> 00:02:12,940
UNTIL OBAMA LEFT OFFICE.

66
00:02:12,940 --> 00:02:15,843
YOU SEE THE LEFT PROTECTS AND

67
00:02:15,843 --> 00:02:17,444
DEFENDS THEIR OWN BECAUSE THEY

68
00:02:17,444 --> 00:02:21,482
ARE IMMUNE TO CRITICIZE THEM FOR

69
00:02:21,482 --> 00:02:22,116
THEIR UNSAVORY POLITICAL

70
00:02:22,116 --> 00:02:22,616
ASSOCIATIONS.

71
00:02:22,616 --> 00:02:25,019
BUT THE PRESIDENT CALLS AN

72
00:02:25,019 --> 00:02:26,453
ACTRESS AND CONGRATULATES HER

73
00:02:26,453 --> 00:02:28,055
FOR HER RATINGS SUCCESS, AND

74
00:02:28,055 --> 00:02:29,657
SUDDENLY HE IS RESPONSIBLE FOR

75
00:02:29,657 --> 00:02:32,159
EVERYTHING SHE HAS EVER DONE OR

76
00:02:32,159 --> 00:02:35,362
WILL DO.

77
00:02:35,362 --> 00:02:37,931
>> WHEN YOU HAVE A PRESIDENT

78
00:02:37,931 --> 00:02:40,467
THAT STARTED HIS CAREER ON THE

79
00:02:40,467 --> 00:02:42,069
BREATH TERRORISM, SAYING HE

80
00:02:42,069 --> 00:02:43,604
ISN'T ONE OF US, WHEN HE'S DONE

81
00:02:43,604 --> 00:02:47,441
EVERYTHING HE CAN TO DO DOG

82
00:02:47,441 --> 00:02:49,209
WHISTLING AROUND THIS ISSUE OF

83
00:02:49,209 --> 00:02:51,011
RACE, PEOPLE LIKE ROSEANNE

84
00:02:51,011 --> 00:02:53,213
FEEL THEY ARE EMPOWERED.

85
00:02:53,213 --> 00:02:54,848
>> Laura: WHAT A FRAUD.

86
00:02:54,848 --> 00:02:57,751
THIS IS THE MAN WHO BROUGHT US

87
00:02:57,751 --> 00:03:00,888
THE FAKE TAWANA BRAWLEY CASE.

88
00:03:00,888 --> 00:03:04,224
AND THAT WAS WHEN HE WASN'T

89
00:03:04,224 --> 00:03:06,627
EVADING TAXES OR SHAKING DOWN

90
00:03:06,627 --> 00:03:07,061
CORPORATIONS.

91
00:03:07,061 --> 00:03:09,830
AND THIS IS WHO MSNBC WHEELS OUT

92
00:03:09,830 --> 00:03:13,200
ON AS AN EXPERT.

93
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:15,769
SHARPTON ON BIGOTRY AND CIVILITY

94
00:03:15,769 --> 00:03:16,704
IN AMERICA?

95
00:03:16,704 --> 00:03:17,037
PLEASE.

96
00:03:17,037 --> 00:03:19,440
THE LEFT HAS TO TAG IT

97
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:21,342
ROSEANNE'S RACIAL MISDEED TO

98
00:03:21,342 --> 00:03:24,812
TRUMP, WHY?

99
00:03:24,812 --> 00:03:26,613
BECAUSE THEY HAVE NO SUBSTANTIVE

100
00:03:26,613 --> 00:03:28,482
ANSWERS TO THE PROBLEMS FACING

101
00:03:28,482 --> 00:03:29,917
MINORITY COMMUNITIES TODAY.

102
00:03:29,917 --> 00:03:36,223
THEIR ONLY RECOURSE IS TO DO

103
00:03:36,223 --> 00:03:37,491
THIS TO DEMONIZE THEIR

104
00:03:37,491 --> 00:03:38,192
OPPONENTS.

105
00:03:38,192 --> 00:03:38,859
MEANWHILE PRESIDENT TRUMP IS

106
00:03:38,859 --> 00:03:42,429
ACTUALLY DELIVERING UNDENIABLE

107
00:03:42,429 --> 00:03:43,263
RESULTS.

108
00:03:43,263 --> 00:03:44,231
WE KNOW UNEMPLOYMENT AMONG

109
00:03:44,231 --> 00:03:47,034
BLACKS AND HISPANICS IS DOWN TO

110
00:03:47,034 --> 00:03:47,901
HISTORICAL LOWS.

111
00:03:47,901 --> 00:03:50,104
WE KNOW THEY ARE TRYING TO READ

112
00:03:50,104 --> 00:03:53,440
THEIR COMMUNITIES OF GANGS LIKE

113
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:54,675
MS-13, AND THE PRESIDENT IS

114
00:03:54,675 --> 00:03:56,110
WORKING WITH CONGRESS TO PASS

115
00:03:56,110 --> 00:03:59,346
PRISON REFORM.

116
00:03:59,346 --> 00:04:02,015
ALL OF THIS HAS CAUSE TO

117
00:04:02,015 --> 00:04:05,652
SUPPORT, AND GROW AMONG MINORITY

118
00:04:05,652 --> 00:04:06,854
GROUPS, MODEST GAINS.

119
00:04:06,854 --> 00:04:08,355
BUT THE LAST OF COURSE REFUSES

120
00:04:08,355 --> 00:04:09,757
TO APPLAUD ANY OF TRUMPS

121
00:04:09,757 --> 00:04:11,425
PROGRESS OR WORK WITH HIM, EVEN

122
00:04:11,425 --> 00:04:14,428
ON ISSUES WHERE THEY HAVE COMMON

123
00:04:14,428 --> 00:04:15,062
GROUND.

124
00:04:15,062 --> 00:04:16,863
THAT IS HOW FANATICAL THEY ARE.

125
00:04:16,863 --> 00:04:19,899
INSTEAD, WHAT THE LEFT DOES IS

126
00:04:19,899 --> 00:04:21,668
THEY PLOT A WAY ON HOW TO

127
00:04:21,668 --> 00:04:23,637
EXPLOIT THE NEXT MOMENT OF

128
00:04:23,637 --> 00:04:25,038
RACIAL OUTRAGE.

129
00:04:25,038 --> 00:04:28,442
HERE IS HOW HOOVER INSTITUTIONS

130
00:04:28,442 --> 00:04:30,344
FELLOW AND PHENOMENAL AUTHOR

131
00:04:30,344 --> 00:04:31,578
SHELBY STEELE WHO ACTUALLY LIVED

132
00:04:31,578 --> 00:04:33,080
THROUGH SEGREGATION IN THE

133
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:34,615
SOUTH, HOW HE SEES IT FROM TODAY

134
00:04:34,615 --> 00:04:36,550
ON THE RADIO SHOW.

135
00:04:36,550 --> 00:04:38,118
>> IT'S AMAZING TO ME THAT THE

136
00:04:38,118 --> 00:04:43,023
AMOUNT OF CREATIVITY AND

137
00:04:43,023 --> 00:04:45,859
IMAGINATION THAT GOES INTO SOME

138
00:04:45,859 --> 00:04:46,827
REINVENTING RACISM,

139
00:04:46,827 --> 00:04:47,861
VIRTUALIZATION IS POWER, AND IF

140
00:04:47,861 --> 00:04:50,831
THE MONEY.

141
00:04:50,831 --> 00:04:54,101
THIS -- THESE ARE PEOPLE WHO ARE

142
00:04:54,101 --> 00:04:57,538
PURSUING A RACE-FREE WORLD, A

143
00:04:57,538 --> 00:04:58,839
WORLD FREE OF RACISM.

144
00:04:58,839 --> 00:05:02,609
BUT THESE ARE PEOPLE WHO ARE

145
00:05:02,609 --> 00:05:04,445
PURSUING WEALTH.

146
00:05:04,445 --> 00:05:05,279
THEY ARE RACIAL ENTREPRENEURS.

147
00:05:05,279 --> 00:05:09,850
THEY MAKE CAREERS OUT OF THIS.

148
00:05:09,850 --> 00:05:11,852
THE WHITE MIDDLE CLASS TODAY IS

149
00:05:11,852 --> 00:05:15,255
SADLY SUPPORTED BY DIVERSITY

150
00:05:15,255 --> 00:05:16,957
WORK AND PROGRAMS.

151
00:05:16,957 --> 00:05:18,325
>> Laura: AGAIN, THAT'S FROM

152
00:05:18,325 --> 00:05:21,061
AN AFRICAN-AMERICAN MAN WHO

153
00:05:21,061 --> 00:05:22,196
LIVED THROUGH REAL RACISM,

154
00:05:22,196 --> 00:05:24,331
SUFFERED THROUGH SEGREGATION.

155
00:05:24,331 --> 00:05:28,302
HIS COMMENTS?

156
00:05:28,302 --> 00:05:32,306
WELL, PEOPLE OF COURSE READ IT

157
00:05:32,306 --> 00:05:34,341
ROSEANN'S TWEET AS TOTALLY

158
00:05:34,341 --> 00:05:36,043
BIASED.

159
00:05:36,043 --> 00:05:36,810
SHE HERSELF SAYS IT'S

160
00:05:36,810 --> 00:05:37,444
INDEFENSIBLE.

161
00:05:37,444 --> 00:05:41,248
BUT THERE OTHER FORMS OF BIAS

162
00:05:41,248 --> 00:05:42,683
THAT MALIGNING GOOD AND

163
00:05:42,683 --> 00:05:44,651
HARDWORKING AMERICANS EVERY DAY.

164
00:05:44,651 --> 00:05:47,821
REMEMBER THE WOMEN WHO VOTED FOR

165
00:05:47,821 --> 00:05:48,121
TRUMP?

166
00:05:48,121 --> 00:05:50,958
>> IN LIGHT OF THIS LAST

167
00:05:50,958 --> 00:05:52,326
ELECTION, I AM CONCERNED ABOUT

168
00:05:52,326 --> 00:05:56,096
US AS WOMEN, AND HOW WE THINK.

169
00:05:56,096 --> 00:05:59,233

CONVERSATION WITH OURSELVES AS

171

WOMEN.

172
00:06:01,268 --> 00:06:03,036
THIS IS NOT AN EXTERNAL

173
00:06:03,036 --> 00:06:06,440
CONVERSATION, THAT'S ON US.

174
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:08,775
>> Laura: THEN THEY HAVE

175
00:06:08,775 --> 00:06:12,012
COMMENTS LIKE, FROM HER TELL US

176
00:06:12,012 --> 00:06:12,846
WHAT TO DO.

177
00:06:12,846 --> 00:06:14,414
REALLY?

178
00:06:14,414 --> 00:06:17,050
A BLACK RAPPER WHO SUPPORTS

179
00:06:17,050 --> 00:06:17,351
TRUMP.

NEGATIVE TO GET IT.

SAYING DON'T BE TOO HARD ON MY

HUSBAND TO COME UP DON'T MAKE IT

SEEM LIKE IT'S GOING THROUGH

189
00:06:30,364 --> 00:06:34,434
SOME KIND OF MENTAL BREAKDOWN.

190
00:06:34,434 --> 00:06:38,605
AND WE THINK THAT HE HAS LOST

00:06:38,605 --> 00:06:38,972
HIS MIND.

192
00:06:38,972 --> 00:06:47,614
>> TRADITIONAL CHRISTIANS.

193
00:06:47,614 --> 00:06:51,585
>> ONE THING TO TALK TO JESUS,

194
00:06:51,585 --> 00:06:52,819
AND IT'S ANOTHER THING WHEN

195
00:06:52,819 --> 00:06:56,089
JESUS TALKS TO GO.

196
00:06:56,089 --> 00:07:00,027
>> Laura: EXACTLY.

197
00:07:00,027 --> 00:07:02,029
THAT'S CALLED MENTAL ILLNESS IF

198
00:07:02,029 --> 00:07:03,030
I'M NOT CORRECT.

199
00:07:03,030 --> 00:07:04,831
>> Laura: WE ARE BASICALLY

200
00:07:04,831 --> 00:07:06,033
TALKING PRETTY MUCH ABOUT ANY

201
00:07:06,033 --> 00:07:08,635
AND ALL TRUMP SUPPORTERS.

202
00:07:08,635 --> 00:07:10,704
>> YOU COULD PUT HALF OF TRUMP

203
00:07:10,704 --> 00:07:12,306
SUPPORTERS INTO WHAT I CALL THE

204
00:07:12,306 --> 00:07:14,841
BASKET OF DEPLORABLE'S.

205
00:07:14,841 --> 00:07:16,843
>> Laura: WELL THINK ABOUT IT

206
00:07:16,843 --> 00:07:18,211
THIS OTHER WAY.

207
00:07:18,211 --> 00:07:20,480
IF TRUMP CREATED A SAFE SPACE

208
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:22,916
FOR ROSEANN TO WRITE THIS

209
00:07:22,916 --> 00:07:28,689
INFLAMMATORY TWEET, MAYBE WITH

210
00:07:28,689 --> 00:07:31,258
THAT DEPLORABLE'S COMMENT,

211
00:07:31,258 --> 00:07:32,059
HILLARY CLINTON INSPIRED THIS.

212
00:07:32,059 --> 00:07:33,860
>> TENS OF MILLIONS OF PEOPLE

213
00:07:33,860 --> 00:07:36,430
VOTED FOR HIM, AFTER HE SHOWED

214
00:07:36,430 --> 00:07:40,267
HIS CARDS, FOR YEARS.

215
00:07:40,267 --> 00:07:40,567
AND --

216
00:07:40,567 --> 00:07:43,704
>> ARE YOU SAYING THEY WERE

217
00:07:43,704 --> 00:07:44,605
RACIST?

218
00:07:44,605 --> 00:07:44,938
>> YES.

219
00:07:44,938 --> 00:07:47,441
>> Laura: WHILE THEY ARE

220
00:07:47,441 --> 00:07:48,842
DEPLORABLE AFTER ALL.

221
00:07:48,842 --> 00:07:50,043
ROSEANN HAS NOW BEEN

222
00:07:50,043 --> 00:07:51,478
EXCOMMUNICATED FROM THE PUBLIC

223
00:07:51,478 --> 00:07:53,246
SQUARE FOR COMMENTS THAT ABC

224
00:07:53,246 --> 00:07:54,848
RIGHTFULLY CHARACTERIZED AS

225
00:07:54,848 --> 00:07:55,983
ABHORRENT, REPUGNANT AND

226
00:07:55,983 --> 00:07:58,285
INCONSISTENT WITH OUR VALUES.

227
00:07:58,285 --> 00:08:00,120
MY QUESTION IS, WHEN WILL THE

228
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:00,854
DAY OF RECKONING COME FOR THOSE

229
00:08:00,854 --> 00:08:04,524
ON THE LEFT, WHOSE OWN ABHORRENT

230
00:08:04,524 --> 00:00:00,000
AND REPUGNANT VIEWS ARE
