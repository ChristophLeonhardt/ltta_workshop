WE ARE IN A CULTURAL MOMENT,
WE ARE IN A VITAL POLITICAL
MOMENT.
JUST AS WE ARE MOVING IN THE
RIGHT DIRECTION IN GENDER
EQUALITY, WE ARE MOVING IN THE
WRONG DIRECTION WHEN IT COMES
TO POLICY.
ONE PARTY IS OVERWHELMINGLY TO
BLAME.
WE DISCOVERED THAT LAST
THURSDAY.
CHRISTINE FORD IS A GOOD
PERSON CAUGHT UP IN AN UGLY
WAR.
IT WAS A SMALL DETAIL THAT
GAVE THE GAME AWAY.
THE REVELATION THAT EVEN AS
THE DEMOCRATS WERE HOLDING THE
SEXUAL ASSAULT ALLEGATION,
FROM THE FBI AND FROM BRETT
KAVANAUGH HIMSELF, THEY KNEW
THEY WERE GOING TO MAKE HER
NAME PUBLIC, THEY KNEW THEY
WERE GOING TO DO IT AFTER THE
STRENGTH SO NOW WE KNOW THE
DEMOCRATS WERE NOT PROTECTING
A VICTIM OF SEXUAL ASSAULT,
THEY WERE PREPARING HER FOR
USE AS APPLICABLE WEAPON.
WHEN I WATCH THAT HEARING,
SOMETHING CHANGED FOR ME.
I WOKE UP TO THE TRUTH ABOUT
THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY
ESTABLISHMENT.
THIS WHOLE THING, IT'S NOT
ABOUT WOMEN'S RIGHTS.
IF IT WAS THEY WOULD BE
EQUALLY OUTRAGED ABOUT THEIR
OWN ABUSER KEITH ELLISON.
IT'S NOT ABOUT OVER TO
OVERTURNING THE PATRIARCHY IS
ABOUT OVERTURNING THE
ELECTION.
THEY SEE IT THAT IF THEY LET
THE PRESIDENT FILL THE SEAT
THEIR POWER IS LOSS FOR
GENERATION OR MORE.
THEY WILL TAKE ANY PRICE TO
TAKE THAT POWER.
THROW HER TO THE WOLVES, JUDGE
KAVANAUGH, WHO CARES, THE
SUPREME COURT, THROUGH THAT AS
LONG AS WE WIT.
THE FABRIC OF OUR SOCIETY, RIP
IT TO PIECES AS LONG AS WE
KEEP THE BIGGEST ONE.
YOU KNOW ME, I TRY TO BE
REASONABLE, OPEN-MINDED, I
HATE PARTISANSHIP.
I WANT HELP BUILD THE POPULACE
MOVEMENT BEYOND PARTY, ONE
THAT IS PRO- WORKER,
PROFAMILY, PRO- AMERICA, BUT I
CAN'T TAKE THESE ESTABLISHMENT
DEMOCRATS ANYMORE.
THESE IDENTITY POLITICS IDIOT
FOR RECKLESSLY DIVIDING THIS
COUNTRY, BLACK AGAINST WHITE,
YOUNG AGAINST OLD, A AGAINST
STRAIGHT AND MEN AGAINST
WOMEN.
WHATEVER HAPPENED WITH THE
BRETT KAVANAUGH SITUATION,
WHETHER HE'S CONFIRMED OR
BROUGHT DOWN BY NEW
ALLEGATIONS.
THE WAY THAT THE DEMOCRATS
HAVE FOUGHT HIS NOMINATION
WILL HAVE A LASTING, CORROSIVE
EFFECT ON THIS COUNTRY.
BEFORE THURSDAY I JUST
DISAGREED WITH THEM.
NOW I'M FRIGHTENED OF THEM.
BECAUSE THE MASK WAS RIPPED
OFF.
UNDERNEATH ALL THAT POMPOUS
SANCTIMONIOUS PREENING ABOUT
SOCIAL JUSTICE AND BEING ON
THE RIGHT SIDE OF HISTORY,
THEY REMIND US OF THE DARKEST
DAYS OF HISTORY, THE SNARLING
AUTHORITARIANISM 20th
CENTURY EUROPE.
IT IS A FRIGHTENING FUTURE IF
THEY'RE ALLOWED TO PREVAIL.
FUTURE TO BORROW FROM GEORGE
ORWELL OF THE BOOT STOMPING ON
