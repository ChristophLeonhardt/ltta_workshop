00:00:04,290 --> 00:00:09,450
In February 2016, Iowa and New Hampshire will
receive huge media attention, as their residents

2
00:00:09,450 --> 00:00:13,120
are the first to vote for the upcoming presidential
nominees.

3
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:16,670
In Iowa, results come from in-person events
called “caucuses”.

4
00:00:16,670 --> 00:00:20,410
But in New Hampshire, the decision is the
result of a primary election.

5
00:00:20,410 --> 00:00:23,090
What is the difference between a caucus and
a primary?

6
00:00:23,090 --> 00:00:25,650
And how important are these in the general
election?

7
00:00:25,650 --> 00:00:30,590
Well, a caucus is essentially a voting party
for presidential nominees, held at a designated

8
00:00:30,590 --> 00:00:33,220
public space - like a school or a city center.

9
00:00:33,220 --> 00:00:37,270
The term dates back to the early 1800s when
political leaders would meet to deliberate

10
00:00:37,270 --> 00:00:39,140
over president and vice president nominations.

11
00:00:39,140 --> 00:00:44,640
The word “caucus” is actually an Algonquian
term meaning a “gathering of tribal chiefs”.

12
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:47,190
But today, any registered voter can attend
a caucus.

13
00:00:47,190 --> 00:00:53,760
In Iowa there are 99 caucuses, with anywhere
from 20 to 200 people expected at each meeting.

14
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:57,760
Caucus attendees discuss their party’s candidates
for several hours, then narrow down their

15
00:00:57,760 --> 00:01:00,720
choices through an in-person voting process.

16
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:06,759
The votes are tallied on-site, and a statewide
winner is chosen later that same night.

17
00:01:06,759 --> 00:01:10,760
Candidates who finish on top continue their
campaigns well into the election cycle, while

18
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:13,470
unpopular candidates usually drop out soon
after.

19
00:01:13,470 --> 00:01:17,500
Republicans and Democrats hold separate caucuses,
and each has their own set of rules.

20
00:01:17,500 --> 00:01:22,370
After opening remarks and discussion, Republicans
cast their votes on secret ballots, which

21
00:01:22,370 --> 00:01:24,270
is similar to a general election.

22
00:01:24,270 --> 00:01:27,970
Democrats, however, physically divide into
groups according to their preferred candidate,

23
00:01:27,970 --> 00:01:31,080
then try to persuade others to join their
side.

24
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:36,659
After hours of back-and-forth, any group with
less than 15% of attendees is eliminated,

25
00:01:36,659 --> 00:01:39,990
forcing those members to opt for one of the
remaining candidates.

26
00:01:39,990 --> 00:01:43,270
The group with the most members determines
the winning candidate.

27
00:01:43,270 --> 00:01:46,510
Caucuses were once the most common way for
states to choose presidential nominees.

28
00:01:46,510 --> 00:01:53,930
However today, only 10 states hold caucuses.

29
00:01:53,930 --> 00:01:59,510
The rest use primaries, which are almost indistinguishable
from the voting process in the general election.

30
00:01:59,510 --> 00:02:04,590
Unlike caucuses, which are mass public meetings,
primaries rely on secret voting from polling

31
00:02:04,590 --> 00:02:06,420
places and absentee ballots.

32
00:02:06,420 --> 00:02:11,049
Different states hold different types of primaries,
but in general they come in two basic forms.

33
00:02:11,049 --> 00:02:15,139
In an open primary, all registered voters
can vote for any candidate.

34
00:02:15,139 --> 00:02:20,900
That means that in 2016 a registered republican
could vote for Bernie Sanders, or a Democrat

35
00:02:20,900 --> 00:02:22,069
for Ted Cruz.

36
00:02:22,069 --> 00:02:27,090
But in a closed primary, voters can only vote
for candidates in their affiliated party,

37
00:02:27,090 --> 00:02:30,299
and independents have to change their party
affiliation to vote.

38
00:02:30,299 --> 00:02:35,389
New Hampshire is neither closed nor open because
while independents are allowed to vote, registered

39
00:02:35,389 --> 00:02:37,749
republicans and democrats must stick to their
party.

40
00:02:37,749 --> 00:02:40,090
This is called a semi-closed primary.

41
00:02:40,090 --> 00:02:43,730
Federal law doesn’t govern how states choose
their delegates, so states can decide whether

42
00:02:43,730 --> 00:02:45,930
they want to hold caucuses or primaries.

43
00:02:45,930 --> 00:02:50,819
Since 1970, the country has steadily moved
toward primaries, as they consistently yield

44
00:02:50,819 --> 00:02:56,340
greater voter turnout and are widely considered
to be a fairer way of choosing delegates.

45
00:02:56,340 --> 00:03:00,629
Because caucuses are funded by the political
parties themselves, whereas primary funds

46
00:03:00,629 --> 00:03:05,900
come from the state, some states prefer caucuses
as they are cheaper.

47
00:03:05,900 --> 00:03:07,799
Certain states have even switched back and
forth.

48
00:03:07,799 --> 00:03:12,299
For instance, Colorado switched to caucuses
back in 2000 to save money, but considered

49
00:03:12,299 --> 00:03:14,609
holding a primary for 2016.

50
00:03:14,609 --> 00:03:18,290
Caucuses have historically benefitted certain
types of candidates over others, as they tend

51
00:03:18,290 --> 00:03:20,629
to attract the most dedicated voters.

52
00:03:20,629 --> 00:03:25,459
This can ultimately skew the outcome, because
average voters or those with time constraints

53
00:03:25,459 --> 00:03:30,370
don’t usually take part in caucuses; while
they might be more likely to participate in

54
00:03:30,370 --> 00:03:31,370
primaries.

55
00:03:31,370 --> 00:03:35,650
But in the end, both elections carry equal
weight in the larger presidential race.

56
00:03:35,650 --> 00:03:40,879
Caucus and primary results are heavily emphasized
in the media but often fail to accurately

57
00:03:40,879 --> 00:03:44,980
predict who will win the presidential or even
the party seat.

58
00:03:44,980 --> 00:03:48,799
So, why exactly does Iowa get to host the
first caucus in the country?

59
00:03:48,799 --> 00:03:50,909
And what’s so important about that anyway?
