TRAGIC EVENT.

4
00:00:14,385 --> 00:00:15,085
THERE ARE TOO FEW WORDS TO

00:00:15,085 --> 00:00:17,922
DESCRIBE THE LAW SO GREAT.

6
00:00:17,922 --> 00:00:19,390

STILL FACE CHARGES AND HAVE NOT

21
00:00:43,914 --> 00:00:45,516

CONSUMED IN 82 MINUTES.

27
00:00:56,894 --> 00:00:58,996
HE LATER FELL DOWN A FLIGHT OF

28
00:00:58,996 --> 00:00:59,697
STAIRS, HE BECAME UNCONSCIOUS

29
00:00:59,697 --> 00:01:04,902

US TONIGHT.

36
00:01:13,544 --> 00:01:15,512
THIS IS THE FIRST INDIVIDUAL TO

37
00:01:15,512 --> 00:01:17,314
STEP UP AND TAKE ANY FORM OF

38
00:01:17,314 --> 00:01:18,916
RESPONSIBLY FOR WHAT HAPPENED,

39
00:01:18,916 --> 00:01:20,517
RIGHT?

40
00:01:20,517 --> 00:01:21,018
>> THAT'S CORRECT.

41
00:01:21,018 --> 00:01:22,353
THIS IS THE FIRST INDIVIDUAL WHO

42
00:01:22,353 --> 00:01:24,555
HAS STEPPED UP AND SAID THAT HE

43
00:01:24,555 --> 00:01:27,524
IS RESPONSIBLE, HE HAS ACTUALLY

44
00:01:27,524 --> 00:01:28,859
PLED GUILTY TO EIGHT COUNTS,

45
00:01:28,859 --> 00:01:31,362
ACTUALLY NINE COUNTS.

46
00:01:31,362 --> 00:01:31,962
>> Martha: THAT INCLUDES

47
00:01:31,962 --> 00:01:32,730
HAZING, WHAT ELSE DID HE PLEAD

48
00:01:32,730 --> 00:01:33,697
GUILTY TO, AND WHAT KIND OF

49
00:01:33,697 --> 00:01:36,333
POTENTIAL PUNISHMENT WILL BE

50
00:01:36,333 --> 00:01:38,335
ATTACHED?

51
00:01:38,335 --> 00:01:38,736
>> SURE.

52
00:01:38,736 --> 00:01:41,772
HE PLED GUILTY TO FOUR COUNTS OF

53
00:01:41,772 --> 00:01:46,176
HAZING, FOUR COUNTS OF SERVING

54
00:01:46,176 --> 00:01:50,648
ALCOHOLIC BEVERAGES AND ONE

55
00:01:50,648 --> 00:01:51,215
COUNT OF CONSUMPTION.

56
00:01:51,215 --> 00:01:51,915
HE ACTUALLY WAS UNDER THE AGE

57
00:01:51,915 --> 00:01:52,249
HIMSELF.

58
00:01:52,249 --> 00:01:52,783
HE WAS 20 YEARS OLD.

59
00:01:52,783 --> 00:01:53,517
BUT HERE'S THE REALLY IMPORTANT

60
00:01:53,517 --> 00:01:54,518
PART OF IT.

61
00:01:54,518 --> 00:01:56,520
THIS TOOK PLACE, HIS CONDUCT

62
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:57,955
TOOK PLACE IN THE SO-CALLED

63
00:01:57,955 --> 00:02:01,458
SOCIAL, WHICH WAS ACTUALLY AN

64
00:02:01,458 --> 00:02:02,359
EXTENSION OF HAZING AND IT WAS

65
00:02:02,359 --> 00:02:05,329
ACTUALLY CAUGHT ON THE BASEMENT

66
00:02:05,329 --> 00:02:06,597
VIDEO, WHICH OF COURSE THERE WAS

67
00:02:06,597 --> 00:02:08,499
AN ATTEMPT TO TRY TO CONCEAL IT.

68
00:02:08,499 --> 00:02:09,600
WE HAVE EVIDENCE THAT THEY

69
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:11,969
ATTEMPTED TO TRY TO CONCEAL,

70
00:02:11,969 --> 00:02:13,604
WHICH PROVED HIS GUILT AND HE

71
00:02:13,604 --> 00:02:14,505
ADMITTED GUILT TO SOMETHING

72
00:02:14,505 --> 00:02:16,306
WHICH IS BEING CONTESTED BY ALL

73
00:02:16,306 --> 00:02:18,142
THE OTHER DEFENDANTS.

74
00:02:18,142 --> 00:02:19,109
THE VERY IMPORTANT DAY PURITY

75
00:02:19,109 --> 00:02:20,444
>> Martha: SO WHAT IS THE

76
00:02:20,444 --> 00:02:23,947
IMPACT ON THE OTHER CASES?

77
00:02:23,947 --> 00:02:24,948
>> WELL, WE ARE HOPEFUL THAT HIS

78
00:02:24,948 --> 00:02:27,317
STEPS WILL BE FOLLOWED.

79
00:02:27,317 --> 00:02:30,721
WE ARE VERY HOPEFUL, AND I SPOKE

80
00:02:30,721 --> 00:02:31,422
WITH JIM PIAZZA JUST BEFORE I

81
00:02:31,422 --> 00:02:34,258
CAME ON YOUR SHOW, WE ARE ALL

82
00:02:34,258 --> 00:02:35,325
HOPEFUL THAT THERE WILL BE

83
00:02:35,325 --> 00:02:36,694
OTHERS WHO WILL FOLLOW SUIT.

84
00:02:36,694 --> 00:02:40,831
WE HOPE THAT THIS WILL INFORM

85
00:02:40,831 --> 00:02:42,166
THESE BROTHERS THAT THEY SHOULD

86
00:02:42,166 --> 00:02:46,136
COME FORWARD, THAT THEY SHOULD

87
00:02:46,136 --> 00:02:47,204
ACCEPT THEIR COMPLICITY IN WHAT

88
00:02:47,204 --> 00:02:48,772
WAS COLLECTIVELY A HORRIBLE

89
00:02:48,772 --> 00:02:51,542
EVENT WHICH LED TO TIM PIAZZA'S

90
00:02:51,542 --> 00:02:52,309
CATASTROPHIC INJURY AND THEN TO

91
00:02:52,309 --> 00:02:53,477
HIS DEATH.

92
00:02:53,477 --> 00:02:55,079
WE HOPE THAT THEY WILL COME

93
00:02:55,079 --> 00:02:55,412
FORWARD.

94
00:02:55,412 --> 00:02:56,113
MR. BURKE HAS DONE THE RIGHT

95
00:02:56,113 --> 00:02:58,348
THING HERE.

96
00:02:58,348 --> 00:02:59,717
>> Martha: THE SENTENCING WILL

97
00:02:59,717 --> 00:03:01,051
BE JULY 31ST, AND THAT'S GOING

98
00:03:01,051 --> 00:03:03,554
TO BE THE FIRST OPPORTUNITY THAT

99
00:03:03,554 --> 00:03:05,089
THE PIAZZAS, WHO HAVE SPOKEN

100
00:03:05,089 --> 00:03:06,623
HERE ON OUR SHOW MANY TIMES, AND

101
00:03:06,623 --> 00:03:08,625
OUR THOUGHTS ARE WITH THEM AS WE

102
00:03:08,625 --> 00:03:09,359
GO THROUGH THIS PROCESS, THEY

103
00:03:09,359 --> 00:03:13,430
WILL BE ABLE TO MAKE -- WILL

104
00:03:13,430 --> 00:03:14,531
THEY DO THAT?

105
00:03:14,531 --> 00:03:15,065
>> THAT'S CORRECT.

106
00:03:15,065 --> 00:03:20,337
JIM AND EVELYN PIAZZA, TIM

107
00:03:20,337 --> 00:03:22,306
PIAZZA'S COURAGEOUS PARENTS,

108
00:03:22,306 --> 00:03:23,707
CRUSADERS NOT ONLY ON BEHALF OF

109
00:03:23,707 --> 00:03:25,109
JUSTICE FOR TIM, BUT ON BEHALF

110
00:03:25,109 --> 00:03:26,343
OF HAZING AND ABUSE ON COLLEGE

111
00:03:26,343 --> 00:03:27,211
CAMPUSES, THEY WILL BE HEARD NOW

112
00:03:27,211 --> 00:03:30,114
FOR THE FIRST TIME IN A VICTIM

113
00:03:30,114 --> 00:03:30,614
IMPACT STATEMENT.

114
00:03:30,614 --> 00:03:33,417
THAT ALSO WILL BE A BANNER AND A

115
00:03:33,417 --> 00:03:35,352
VERY IMPORTANT DAY.

116
00:03:35,352 --> 00:03:36,587
>> Martha: WHAT IS THE SORT OF

117
00:03:36,587 --> 00:03:39,123
STRONGEST CHARGES THAT REMAIN

118
00:03:39,123 --> 00:03:40,324
FOR THE OTHER MEMBERS OF THE

119
00:03:40,324 --> 00:03:42,059
FRATERNITY, AND DO YOU THINK

120
00:03:42,059 --> 00:03:44,128
THAT ULTIMATELY ANYBODY WILL DO

121
00:03:44,128 --> 00:03:44,428
TIME?

122
00:03:44,428 --> 00:03:45,529
WHAT KIND OF PUNISHMENT DO YOU

123
00:03:45,529 --> 00:03:49,566
THINK IS POSSIBLE HERE?

124
00:03:49,566 --> 00:03:51,335
>> WELL, PUNISHMENT IS OF COURSE

125
00:03:51,335 --> 00:03:53,103
AN IMPORTANT PART OF DETERRENCE

126
00:03:53,103 --> 00:03:54,037
AND THERE ARE MANY INDIVIDUALS

127
00:03:54,037 --> 00:03:56,440
FACING MANY YEARS IN JAIL.

128
00:03:56,440 --> 00:04:00,344
THE ATTORNEY GENERAL HAS BEEN

129
00:04:00,344 --> 00:04:01,979
STEADFAST IN TRYING TO REINSTATE

130
00:04:01,979 --> 00:04:03,881
THE CHARGES OF INVOLUNTARY

131
00:04:03,881 --> 00:04:04,915
MANSLAUGHTER.

132
00:04:04,915 --> 00:04:07,317
THERE CURRENTLY ARE CHARGES OF

133
00:04:07,317 --> 00:04:09,086
RECKLESS ENDANGERMENT AS WELL AS

134
00:04:09,086 --> 00:04:10,554
HAZING AGAINST MANY INDIVIDUALS.

135
00:04:10,554 --> 00:04:13,724
MR. BURKE HIMSELF FACES EIGHT

136
00:04:13,724 --> 00:04:14,525
COUNTS THAT EACH CARRY WITH IT

137
00:04:14,525 --> 00:04:17,094
POTENTIALLY A YEAR IN JAIL.

138
00:04:17,094 --> 00:04:19,129
AND OF COURSE YOU HAVE THAT

139
00:04:19,129 --> 00:04:20,329
MULTIPLIED BY MANY INDIVIDUALS.

140
00:04:20,329 --> 00:04:21,265
SO THERE ARE SERIOUS CHARGES

141
00:04:21,265 --> 00:04:23,934
WITH SERIOUS POTENTIAL JAIL

142
00:04:23,934 --> 00:04:24,735
TIME.

143
00:04:24,735 --> 00:04:26,136
WE ARE HOPEFUL NOT THAT PEOPLE

144
00:04:26,136 --> 00:04:28,238
GO TO JAIL FOR THE SAKE OF GOING

145
00:04:28,238 --> 00:04:30,474
TO JAIL, BUT RATHER FOR THE SAKE

146
00:04:30,474 --> 00:04:33,610
OF BEING A DETERRENT FROM THIS

147
00:04:33,610 --> 00:04:34,244
HAPPENING IN THE FUTURE.

148
00:04:34,244 --> 00:04:34,878
>> Martha: ABSOLUTELY, AND

149
00:04:34,878 --> 00:04:37,181
THIS IS SOMETHING THAT YOUNG

150
00:04:37,181 --> 00:04:39,316
MEN, AND WOMEN, THIS HAPPENS IN

151
00:04:39,316 --> 00:04:39,983
SORORITIES TOO, ACROSS THE

152
00:04:39,983 --> 00:04:41,552
COUNTRY NEED TO PAY ATTENTION

153
00:04:41,552 --> 00:04:42,553
TO.

154
00:04:42,553 --> 00:04:43,287
THEY SHOULD BE TALKING ABOUT IT

155
00:04:43,287 --> 00:04:44,288
IN THEIR MEETINGS ON CAMPUS

156
00:04:44,288 --> 00:04:47,925
ABOUT THIS SO THAT IT DOESN'T

157
00:04:47,925 --> 00:04:49,126
HAPPEN TO ANOTHER BEAUTIFUL

158
00:04:49,126 --> 00:04:50,260
YOUNG WIFE LIKE TIM PIAZZA AND

159
00:04:50,260 --> 00:04:50,661
HIS FAMILY.

160
00:04:50,661 --> 00:04:53,964
>> I AGREE.

161
00:04:53,964 --> 00:04:55,732
MARTHA, I MIGHT ADD THAT IN

162
00:04:55,732 --> 00:00:00,000
PENNSYLVANIA WE ARE MOVING
