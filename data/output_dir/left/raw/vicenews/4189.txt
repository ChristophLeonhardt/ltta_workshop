1
00:00:24,420 --> 00:00:29,380
Hurricane Irma has been downgraded to
a tropical storm as it blows into Georgia,

2
00:00:29,380 --> 00:00:36,220
leaving Florida reeling from the second major
hurricane to hit the United States in two weeks.

3
00:00:36,220 --> 00:00:41,960
About six-and-a-half million people in the state
were ordered to evacuate ahead of the storm,

4
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:44,720
but most Floridians are hurricane veterans,

5
00:00:44,720 --> 00:00:48,720
and many made their own decisions
about whether or not to leave.

6
00:00:48,720 --> 00:00:50,240
In the city of Homestead,

7
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:54,000
which was destroyed by
Hurricane Andrew 25 years ago,

8
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,060
the Olvera family decided to ride out
this latest hurricane at home.

9
00:01:07,380 --> 00:01:10,140
— My parents are coming over
because they’re in a flood zone,

10
00:01:10,159 --> 00:01:12,000
so they’re going to be coming over with us—

11
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,980
which is my mom, my father,

12
00:01:13,980 --> 00:01:16,700
and my mom’s mom, which is my kids’ great-grandma.

13
00:01:16,700 --> 00:01:17,820
And she’s 80.

14
00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:19,600
And the fact that we’re going to be all together,

15
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:21,420
I think it’s what’s going to help us,

16
00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:26,040
you know, survive it and stay sane
and be okay with what’s going on.

17
00:01:27,180 --> 00:01:30,000
— Good morning, everybody.

18
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:34,760
— We couldn’t escape it no matter what we did.

19
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:37,000
I mean, it’s going to be going all the way up.

20
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,100
Where can we go?

21
00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:39,440
We’re on a peninsula.

22
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:41,560
There’s, you know… there’s only north.

23
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:44,860
But now, it’s traveling north too.

24
00:01:44,860 --> 00:01:49,600
So I just thought of the traffic and
trying to get my kids loaded up into a car,

25
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:51,900
being somewhere where we’re not familiar with.

26
00:01:51,900 --> 00:01:53,560
At least here we know where we’re at.

27
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:54,560
We know where things are at,

28
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:57,470
and in the case of an emergency, we know where to go.

29
00:01:57,470 --> 00:01:59,080
We know where the hospital is.

30
00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:01,220
Being somewhere where we’re not familiar with,

31
00:02:01,220 --> 00:02:02,499
trying to Google everything—

32
00:02:02,499 --> 00:02:03,840
and if the cell towers are down,

33
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:06,820
there’s no way for us to find out anything.

34
00:02:06,820 --> 00:02:08,840
So I think that was the scariest part.

35
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:13,960
My dad built this house,
it took us about six years to build.

36
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:15,960
And thank God that my dad,

37
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:18,400
you know, he’s been in construction for so long,

38
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:20,760
he was able to build us a nice, sturdy home.

39
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:23,080
And I’m really proud of his work.

40
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:25,620
Being that it’s, you know, cement concrete with rebar,

41
00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:27,500
I think we’ll be okay.

42
00:02:28,220 --> 00:02:30,000
— We’ll be back!

43
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:38,320
— They’re reporting tornadoes about
10 miles from where we’re at right now.

44
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:41,260
We’re under a tornado watch.

45
00:02:41,260 --> 00:02:43,600
They’re extending it until 8:15,

46
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:47,660
and other tornado warnings have
been issued to the Redlands,

47
00:02:47,660 --> 00:02:50,320
and that’s where my mother-in-law lives right now.

48
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:06,500
We all just screamed!

49
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:11,620
I think because he built this home,

50
00:03:11,620 --> 00:03:14,360
going through Andrew, he built it stronger.

51
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:16,720
So that’s why I was more confident to stay.

52
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:18,680
And just the experience of having to come back—

53
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:22,400
as a kid, I remember having to
come back and it was really bad.

54
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:26,400
The devastation of what he built
was no longer what it was.

55
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:50,000
— Strong winds…

56
00:04:28,300 --> 00:04:30,720
— We were so sheltered here throughout the storm

57
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:32,940
that it didn’t feel like it was that much.

58
00:04:32,940 --> 00:04:34,640
Of course a couple of debris,

59
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:36,000
but just driving around town…

60
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,400
it’s like, you really did see, it’s bad.

61
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:42,960
I guess because we didn’t have as much damage
and we had a couple of trees down,

62
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:44,440
it didn’t feel as bad.

63
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:45,600
But now thinking about it,

64
00:04:45,610 --> 00:04:48,010
it was really bad and I’m happy
that people were able to leave,

65
00:04:48,010 --> 00:04:49,760
the ones that did leave.

66
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:52,580
I think for us, we lucked out on that,

67
00:04:52,580 --> 00:04:54,980
where we know and we’re safe.

68
00:04:54,980 --> 00:04:56,880
And having just to come back in,

69
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:59,160
it’s going to be a really, really, really hard time—

70
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:02,260
running out of gas, not having food, having babies—

71
00:05:02,260 --> 00:05:05,360
on the road, it’s not easy traveling at all either.

72
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:08,940
So to me, I think we made the best decision to stay.

73
00:05:08,940 --> 00:05:12,910
I could just imagine how scary it was
for these people that had the trees fall down.

74
00:05:12,910 --> 00:05:15,040
I mean, we didn’t have any of that.

75
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:19,000
Look at them—those have been there for years.

76
00:05:19,420 --> 00:05:21,440
We used to play in those trees.

77
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:23,100
And now look at them.

78
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:28,460
Oh my God, it fell on their house.

79
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:29,740
You guys are good, though?

80
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:30,420
— Yeah, yeah.

81
00:05:30,420 --> 00:05:31,700
— Oh, awesome. The boys?

82
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:32,560
— Doing good. You guys?

83
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:33,720
— Yeah, we’re good.

84
00:05:34,260 --> 00:05:37,340
You guys don’t have power then neither, right?

85
00:05:37,340 --> 00:05:38,780
Do you guys have running water?

86
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:40,540
Oh, okay. So that’s good.

87
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:43,740
— You still got liquor?

88
00:05:43,740 --> 00:05:46,530
Okay, that gives me a reason to come back.

89
00:05:47,660 --> 00:05:49,720
— How you are you, honey?

90
00:05:49,940 --> 00:05:50,860
— Look how lucky we were.

91
00:05:51,020 --> 00:05:51,920
— I know!

92
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:53,120
It looks like—

93
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:55,240
we were asking if you guys had
any leaks or anything in it,

94
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:56,880
but he says no, nothing.

95
00:05:56,890 --> 00:05:58,010
And you guys have the generator—

96
00:05:58,010 --> 00:06:00,140
yeah, we don’t have power either.

97
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:04,100
This weather will always be what it is.

98
00:06:04,100 --> 00:06:05,140
You’re living in paradise,

99
00:06:05,140 --> 00:06:07,520
but it comes with some consequences.

100
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:09,220
And some downfalls.

101
00:06:09,220 --> 00:06:11,540
But if I can only deal with this once every 10 years,

102
00:06:11,540 --> 00:06:12,400
then I’m good.

103
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:14,160
I’ll stay here.

104
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:15,880
This is my house.

105
00:06:15,880 --> 00:00:00,000
A storm’s not going to chase us away.
