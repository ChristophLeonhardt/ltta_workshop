KEEP IT RUNNING. MY NEXT GUEST KEPT IT GOING. IF YOU WANTED AN FBI INVESTIGATION YOU SHOULD HAVE COME TO US. YOU WANTED TO HOLD THIS SEAT. YOU WANT POWER AND I HOPE YOU NEVER GET IT. YOU KNEW ABOUT IT AND HELD IT. YOU HAD NO INTENTION OF PROTECTING DR. FORD. SHE'S AS MUCH OF A VICTIM AS YOU ARE. SENATOR IT'S GOOD TO HAVE YOU THIS MORNING. THANK YOU. THANK YOU FOR YOUR LEADERSHIP AND COURAGE. WHAT PROMPTED YOU? OUTRAGE. I'VE KNOWN BRETT. HE'S GONE THROUGH SIX FBI INVESTIGATIONS. HE'S APPOINTED MORE WOMEN TO WORK FOR HIM. THEY TRIED TO DESTROY HIS LIFE. THIS IS ABOUT KEEPING THE SEAT OPEN. THERE ARE NO RULES WHEN IT COMES TO BRETT KAVANAUGH. I HONORED OBAMA'S ELECTION. HE PICKED TWO NOMINATIONS. THEY DON'T WANT TO HONOR TRUMP'S ABILITY TO PICK A FINE MAN. WHEN THEY ASKED FOR THIS TO CONTINUE IT WAS A BRIDGE TOO FAR. I SPOKE IN A LOT OF WAYS THAT REPUBLICANS COULD RELATE TO. I'M A BIPARTISAN GUY AND CONTINUES TO BE. WHEN IT'S ABOUT JUDICIAL NOMINEES I WILL MAKE SURE THEY ARE TREATED FAIRLY. Reporter: WHAT IS YOUR THOUGHT NOW THEY ARE DELAYING FOR ANOTHER WEEK. JEFF FLAKE HAS BEEN A FRIEND OF MINE FOR A LONG TIME. SUZANNE COLLINS AND LISA ARE ALL FINE SENATORS. THEY WOULD LIKE A SUPPLEMENTAL FBI BACKGROUND INVESTIGATION. DR. FORD CAN'T TELL US WHEN OR WHERE IT HAPPENED. THE COMMITTEE SPOKE TO KAISER AND MS. KAISER TOLD US SHE DOESN'T REFUTE WHAT DOCTOR FORD SAID BUT SHE WASN'T AT A PARTY. SHE'S CONFUSED. MARK JUDGE SAID IT DIDN'T HAPPEN. P.J. SAID I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT. THE FBI WILL INTERVIEW THESE PEOPLE AND ASK MARK JUDGE IF THEY HAVE SEEN BRETT KAVANAUGH DRUG WOMEN AND PARTICIPATE IN THE CLAIMS. WELCOME BACK. WE ARE HERE WITH SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM. WE HEARD FROM THOSE PEOPLE AND MANY SAID I WASN'T AT THE PARTY AND DON'T HAVE RECKLESS. WE TOLD THAT TO THE COMMITTEE. THE SENATORS WOULD LIKE TO DOUBLE-CHECK. MS. RAMIREZ HAS REFUSED TO TALK TO US. HER ALLEGATIONS WOULDN'T BE PRINTED BY THE NEW YORK TIMES FOR A GOOD REASON. WE'LL VOTE THIS COMING WEEK. THE FBI SUPPLEMENTAL INVESTIGATION SHOULD BE DONE EARLY THIS WEEK. WE'LL HAVE A FINAL PASSAGE VOTE LATER IN THE WEEK. CONIF I CONFF I CONFIRI I'M HIGHLY CONFIDENT HE'LL BE CONFIRMED. HE'S A GOOD MAN. HE'S THE BEST CHOICE PRESIDENT TRUMP COULD HAVE MADE. I'LL TELL YOU WHAT WILL HAPPEN NEXT IF YOU WILL ALLOW. PLEASE. OKAY, THIS IS WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN. I'LL ASK SENATOR GRASSILY ABOUT HOW THIS HEARING PROCESS WAS HIJACKED BEYOND ETHICAL ASPECTS. THE SLASH AND BURN ASPECTS OF IT AND ABUSE DR. FORD'S TRUST. WE'LL START WITH THE FOLLOWING CONCEPT. DR. FORD SAID AT THE HEARING SHE DIDN'T KNOW THE COMMITTEE WOULD COME TO CALIFORNIA AND TAKE HER TESTIMONY IN A PRIVATE SETTING. THIS IS WHAT SHE SAID. I JUST APPRECIATE YOU DID OFFER THAT. I WASN'T CLEAR ON WHAT THE OFFER WAS. IF YOU WOULD HAVE COME OUT TO SEE ME I WOULD HAVE HAPPILY HOSTED YOU AND SPOKE WITH YOU OUT THERE. IT WASN'T CLEAR TO ME THAT THAT WAS THE CASE. HOW COULD THAT NOT BE CLEAR TO HER? LET ME TELL YOU WHAT THE COMMITTEE DID. ON SEPTEMBER 19, THE STAFF TOLD GRASSILY TO HER ATTORNEY. WE'LL SPEAK TO DR. FORD AT ANY TIME AND PLACE CONVENIENT TO HER. WE ALSO OFFER THE INVESTIGATORS TO MEET WITH DR. FORD ANYWHERE ANY TIME. THIS IS ANOTHER E-MAIL. GRASSILY TWEETS COME TO US OR WE'LL COME TO YOU. I'LL HAVE MY STAFF TRAVEL TO CALIFORNIA TO OBTAIN HER TESTIMONY. A LETTER FROM GRASSILY TO FEINSTEIN. DR. FORD'S ATTORNEY REPLIES. DR. FORD HAS ASKED ME TO LET YOU KNOW SHE APPRECIATES THE OPTIONS YOU HAVE SUGGESTED. CATS E-MAILED BACK. I'M GOING TO FIND OUT WHY SHE DIDN'T KNOW HER OPTIONS. I'M GOING TO FINE OUT WHO IN FEINSTEINS STAFF RECOMMENDED CATS TO BE DOCTOR FORD'S LAWYER. IT'S IMPROPER FOR SENATORS TO RECOMMEND LAWYERS TO CONSTITUENTS. IF HE THOUGHT SHE NEEDED A LAWYER WHY DIDN'T YOU COME FORWARD AND TELL US ABOUT THE ALLEGATIONS. I'LL TRY TO FIND OUT WHO USED HER TRUST. I DON'T BELIEVE FEINSTEIN DID THIS AND DR. FORD'S LAWYER. NO FRIEND WOULD DO THIS TO HER. THE PERSON WHO SENT THIS ANONYMOUS LETTER AND DESTROYED HER TRUST HAD A POLITICAL AGENDA. I'LL GET TO THE BOTTOM OF IT. I WILL FIND OUT WHO LEAKED ANONYMOUS LETTER. IT HAD NO POST PARK OR RETURN ADDRESS CLAIMING THAT JUDGE KAVANAUGH DID SOMETHING IN 1988 AND 1998. SOMEONE LEAKED THAT AND RAN IT AS A STORY. I CAN'T IMAGE IF A DEMOCRATIC COMMITTEE WOULD HAVE DONE THIS. THE BOTTOM LINE IS WE'LL LOOK INTO A BETRAYAL OF TRUST WITH DR. FORD. WE'LL LOOK AT COMMITTEE RULES. WE'LL SEE IF WE CAN PROVE WHAT'S OBVIOUS. THIS WASN'T ABOUT PROTECTING DR FORD BUT DELAYING THE HEARING. IT'S ABOUT RUNNING OUT THE CLOCK AND NEVER CONFRONTING HIM IN REALTIME TO PUT US IN THE BOX WE ARE IN. PEOPLE WOULD ALSO WANT TO KNOW IF LAWS WERE BROKEN IN TERMS OF REVEALING YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION. RAND PAUL IS CALLING FOR AN INVESTIGATION ABOUT WHO PUB PUBBISH PUBLISHED THE PERSONAL INFORMATION OF YOU AND YOUR PARTNERS. THIS IS THE SECOND TIME I HAD TO CHANGE MY PHONE NUMBER. THE FIRST TIME WAS WHEN PRESIDENT TRUMP DID THIS. I'M NOT WORRIED ABOUT MY PHONE NUMBER BUT I AM WORRIED ABOUT MY ADDRESS SENT OUT. WHO DID IT? I DON'T KNOW, I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW. I WANT TO CHANGE THE PROCESS. IF THIS IS THE NEW NORM GOD HELP US ALL. WHO WOULD WANT TO COME BEFORE THIS COMMITTEE. I HOPE THE PEOPLE WHO DID IT DON'T GET AWAY WITH IT. I WOULD LIKE TO FIND OUT WHO DESTROYED DR. FORD'S TRUST AND OUTED HER WHEN SHE WANTED TO BE ANONYMOUS. SENT A DOCUMENT TO AN OUTLET. I ALSO WANT TO KNOW WHAT WILL.ED TO THE FIFTH ACCUSER. WE RECEIVED AN ACCUSATION FROM A MAN IN RHODE ISLAND THAT A FEMALE FRIEND WAS TAKEN OUT BY JUDGE AND KAVANAUGH. HE WENT DOWN AND BEAT BOTH OF
