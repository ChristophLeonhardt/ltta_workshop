00:00:14,429 --> 00:00:16,560
similar and if you mash them up would

00:00:34,590 --> 00:00:36,000
my dissertation he was so supportive

20
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,129
especially in the final crucial days

21
00:00:38,129 --> 00:00:39,570

fell to the asshole count he also found

35
00:01:07,380 --> 00:01:09,150
to the factual inaccuracies camp because

36
00:01:09,150 --> 00:01:10,590
I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> know what special wisdom you</font>

00:01:20,189 --> 00:01:22,130
because the sky<font color="#CCCCCC"> just was like so</font>

43
00:01:22,130 --> 00:01:25,380
ridiculously high and mighty or whatever

44
00:01:25,380 --> 00:01:28,400

47
00:01:34,110 --> 00:01:35,369
maybe I'll follow this up with like a

box of<font color="#E5E5E5"> donuts do you use think coke 17</font>

and brownies my body isn't my central

51
00:01:41,579 --> 00:01:43,020
source of confidence it never has been

52
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:45,420
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I am so over the stage where some</font>

53
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:46,829
pathetic little person in YouTube

55
00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:49,950
me by telling me that I've put<font color="#CCCCCC"> on weight</font>

56
00:01:49,950 --> 00:01:51,630
it's not about<font color="#E5E5E5"> an important comment and</font>

57
00:01:51,630 --> 00:01:53,220
<font color="#CCCCCC">what's more you didn't hurt my feelings</font>

58
00:01:53,220 --> 00:01:54,210
right thing because I know your

59
00:01:54,210 --> 00:01:56,100
fellowship but today's but I'm rereading

60
00:01:56,100 --> 00:01:58,439
divergent by Veronica Roth the<font color="#E5E5E5"> sequel</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

61
00:01:58,439 --> 00:02:00,329
this insurgent is already out even

62
00:02:00,329 --> 00:02:01,740
though they have this really cool cover

63
00:02:01,740 --> 00:02:03,390
for the<font color="#E5E5E5"> UK paperback originally they</font>

64
00:02:03,390 --> 00:02:05,399
just recently redid the cover and it's

65
00:02:05,399 --> 00:02:07,290
so ugly and the second one insurgent

66
00:02:07,290 --> 00:02:09,989
looks like the new<font color="#CCCCCC"> fast copper and it's</font>

67
00:02:09,989 --> 00:02:12,239
just so ugly the<font color="#CCCCCC"> US cover for insurgent</font>

68
00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:12,630
looks

69
00:02:12,630 --> 00:02:14,010
a lot like this so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to be</font>

70
00:02:14,010 --> 00:02:15,930
waiting<font color="#CCCCCC"> until I'm in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> california in june</font>

71
00:02:15,930 --> 00:02:17,550
i finished it breaker which is currently

72
00:02:17,550 --> 00:02:19,320
helping to work as my tripod

73
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:20,610
breaker was nice because it's a little

74
00:02:20,610 --> 00:02:22,200
bit different from<font color="#E5E5E5"> the normal dystopian</font>

75
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:23,880
that I had been<font color="#E5E5E5"> reading but it does</font>

76
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:25,440
again fall into that sort of slightly

77
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:27,000
predictable vein that noise is the

78
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,500
boiler by the way occasionally it was a

79
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:30,450
bit preachy I think again<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's that</font>

80
00:02:30,450 --> 00:02:32,130
thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> that across universities which</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

81
00:02:32,130 --> 00:02:34,080
really<font color="#CCCCCC"> lying where it sort of harks back</font>

82
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:35,640
to the mistakes that people were making

83
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:37,470
now in a way that wasn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

84
00:02:37,470 --> 00:02:39,330
necessary because anyone who was reading

85
00:02:39,330 --> 00:02:41,220
it could tell that you know certain

86
00:02:41,220 --> 00:02:42,420
things were implied you don't have to

87
00:02:42,420 --> 00:02:45,210
say<font color="#CCCCCC"> oh the people</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> back then only knew of</font>

88
00:02:45,210 --> 00:02:47,670
sort of thing it's kind of like a and

89
00:02:47,670 --> 00:02:49,800
where it was really<font color="#E5E5E5"> hard to locate where</font>

90
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:52,530
<font color="#CCCCCC">the story was set at first but I'd know</font>

91
00:02:52,530 --> 00:02:54,150
a third of the way and get more<font color="#E5E5E5"> and more</font>

92
00:02:54,150 --> 00:02:55,920
clues about where it sets and<font color="#E5E5E5"> the choice</font>

93
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:57,810
of location i think was racing because

94
00:02:57,810 --> 00:03:01,620
it tied in with a event that would have

95
00:03:01,620 --> 00:03:03,300
<font color="#CCCCCC">happened a few years with</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> all this book</font>

96
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:05,100
came out I didn't know<font color="#E5E5E5"> how to be a bit</font>

97
00:03:05,100 --> 00:03:07,680
less fake break is basically break

98
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:09,540
apart the stuff on these ships that wash

99
00:03:09,540 --> 00:03:11,100
up on the shore they get out<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the</font>

100
00:03:11,100 --> 00:03:12,630
copper to get out anything that's worth

101
00:03:12,630 --> 00:03:14,160
saving basically metal that has

102
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:16,020
entrusted and one of the light crudes

103
00:03:16,020 --> 00:03:17,340
probably the best of a light group

104
00:03:17,340 --> 00:03:18,900
called<font color="#E5E5E5"> nail</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> oh who's the one of the</font>

105
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:20,220
protagonist<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the book gets himself</font>

106
00:03:20,220 --> 00:03:23,520
into a tight spot very early<font color="#CCCCCC"> on and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> also</font>

107
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:25,860
quickly establishes ideas of royalty and

108
00:03:25,860 --> 00:03:28,380
crew and family and that sort of thing

109
00:03:28,380 --> 00:03:29,820
it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> just a bit was a good book it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

110
00:03:29,820 --> 00:03:31,530
enjoyed<font color="#CCCCCC"> it but I didn't always say as</font>

111
00:03:31,530 --> 00:03:32,910
out this world<font color="#E5E5E5"> but that might just be</font>

112
00:03:32,910 --> 00:03:34,410
because I've read so many<font color="#E5E5E5"> just open</font>

113
00:03:34,410 --> 00:03:36,210
books but<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you do still want it just</font>

114
00:03:36,210 --> 00:03:37,230
open book but you want something

115
00:03:37,230 --> 00:03:39,090
slightly different I would say go for

116
00:03:39,090 --> 00:03:40,650
ship breaker doesn't take too long the

117
00:03:40,650 --> 00:03:43,500
font is quite big and it's only 350

118
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:44,880
pages so now I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to get</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> into</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

119
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:47,550
and I'll see you guys tomorrow<font color="#E5E5E5"> bye</font>

120
00:03:47,550 --> 00:03:49,170
thanks for<font color="#E5E5E5"> the wonderful feedback I'm</font>
