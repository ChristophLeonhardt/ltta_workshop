bring in Chris Matthews the host of hardball Chris of course on days like today nights like tonight we think of the greatness of this man we've lost a great American patriot a great public servant a senator a warrior a politician imperfect he'd be the first to admit and as I was just saying on the 9th anniversary of Teddy Kennedy's death from the same terrible brain cancer well well I said this earlier tonight and I I still think it's what the reason people love the gladiatorial aspect of politics where it's certainly one against the other and there's a real combat to it and you look for guts spiritual guts you look for people that stick to what they believe and there would be their own person and John McCain was always his own person I mean he didn't he wasn't a knee-jerk lefty or a knee-jerk righty he didn't fit the mold which was there for so many of these other politicians just sort of slip into he was always John John McCain and he could be disconcerting you could love him one day and it really meant that the next day because he wasn't there to make you like him and you would love him on mccain-feingold on campaign reform and you may not like him on being hawkish but he was always John McCain he when I I found him to be a character out of the movies in the sense that if you were to write a romantic movie about American politics and the US Senate especially and you wanted to have heroes and people that really stood out and had guts profiles in courage of you well he would be a perfect candidate in real life for that romantic role he was the classic US senator if you ever want to grow up to be a senator I think you'd want to grow up to be John McCain he wouldn't grow up to be just one of the votes for either party he'd want to be someone who everyone wondered about where they going to go and how they going to vote in which their conscience is going to lead them to and and I also like the fact that he was a statesman in the sense that he even though he could be incredibly tough on his opponents and bitter at times he really did stand up for his opponent that Barack Obama and a couple of critical moments one was when that woman in the crowd said that he was an Arab and she meant that in the worst possible way of saying something and McCain could have said yeah I can just got along with that sort of slur it was a slur to her and instead he said no no he's a decent man we just had to disagree in point that is so rare in politics today he also gave a most wonderful testimonial to a Barack Obama when they were going head to head about a couple weeks before the election in 2008 he was at the out Smith dinner and I was there and I remember I went back and dug it up we showed it last night I hope everybody gets to see it again he just it was the most grand endorsement underwear testimonial to his opponent that you don't hear in politics they was wonderful and he did it knowing that he was much the underdog as you know India two and a half weeks before that election the market was dropping and everything was killing a haywire and he was paying the brunt of it and I thought that died that was the best on McCain and Chris the fact that he has still been a force in this last year even while he's suffering from this brain cancer fighting the cancer certainly in his vote against the repeal of Obamacare last July 28th but also a year a year ago July 28th 2017 but in his speech that speech in July in his his statement after Helsinki he has tried to hold the White House to account for the things that he McCain believes in well you know I don't want to say what everybody else is saying about life these days but there there was a quotient of decency and politics until recently where you didn't make fun of your opponents appearance especially maybe if you're a mayor you're making fun of a woman's appearance or something as low down as that that was undone you didn't make nicknames up about your opponents you didn't drive them into the mud you pointed them you out argued them you made your case and you can do it aggressively but he didn't diminish their very being i'ma Kane was that old-school and I think he he was beaten up in that 2000 election they went after his family whenever they said he had I had a illegitimate daughter had turned out he had obviously had it it was someone from South Asia that he had adopted he and Cindy had adopted but they spread the rumors in South Carolina in that primary that it was his illegitimate daughter they said his wife had drug problems they were throwing everything at him and he still stuck with in politics he came back again after you almost had not go up in the early going and not in 2008 he kept going and going and just he wouldn't quit and I think that endurance that he showed over the Hanoi held him all those years where he was just getting beat up and tortured and basically crippled and above his waist and he he just stuck with it and had a sense of humor he's a tough guy head I think he had some bitterness but he didn't let it drive him I think he resented some people like double young people that didn't serve in Vietnam the way he did didn't suffer the way he did but seemed to come out on top I'm sure he did but if the public man I think was a hero and a grand heroes our colleagues said earlier tonight he has had it grandness to him something out of the movies and you reference that Al Smith dinner in 2008 of course a campaign year you were there we've got some of that tape let's say that testimonial to Barack Obama by his competitor John McCain I don't want it getting out of this room but my opponent is an impressive fellow in many ways political opponents can have a little trouble seeing the best in each other but I've had a few glimpses of this man at his best and I admire his great skill energy and determination it's not for nothing that he's inspired so many folks in his own party and beyond senator Obama talks about making history and he's made quite a bit of it already there was a time when the mere invitation of an African American citizen to dine at the White House was taken as an outrage and an insult in many quarters today is a world away from the cruel and prideful bigotry of that time and good riddance I can't wish my opponent luck but I do wish him well Chris that I'm glad you brought that up because that is quite a speech and the the dignity and the honor that he brings to that kind of that he brought to that kind of occasion was classic John McCain well that's why we care and it's why people like you and I spent our lives covering these guys because at their best they are something else something else hey there I'm Chris Hayes from MSNBC thanks for watching MSNBC on
