Europe is looking to bolster its joint defensive with pest go they permanent structured cooperation pact well 25 ye you states have already signed up pesco comprises 18 projects in different spheres of influence some of these will duplicate NATO functions well let's have a closer look at some of these crossovers like NATO pesco will conduct train and assist missions similarly it will dedicate resources to fighting and preventing cyber attacks and it will also establish crisis resolution centers or NATO head yen Stoltenberg says this project will strengthen the European pillar within NATO Oh top EU officials have also praised the pesco pact EU foreign policy chief federica mogherini called the move historic while jean-claude Juncker also welcomed it pointing out that EU security cannot be outsourced however the foreign minister of Poland expressed his concerns he called pesco an experiment and raised doubts where the Europe needs a second defensive body in addition to NATO want to discuss this issue further I'm now joined by political commentators your britmore you all thank you very much for joining us well can europe afford to splash out on another military alliance sorry I didn't hear hello John I'll just repeat the question can Europe afford to splash out to spend big on another military alliance well this is actually you know you hope you and bureaucracy and militarism going wild because you see what's the point of the military is to wage war you can either wage the defensive war if you are under attack of an offensive war if we attack other countries now you can attack weak countries of strong countries now defending ourselves against whom against obviously against Russia but who can think for a second that Russia would learn to war against one of its neighbors I mean you see I mean they are bound to lose that war because the relationship of strength is is not good and they don't want a nuclear war nobody wants a nuclear war so I don't see how it means makes sense you befriend Excel because we don't have any enemies now of course we could also attack Russia that would be suicidal too for the same reason that the only thing that's left is to attack weaker state now we have seen the success of that in Afghanistan in Libya in Syria in Iraq do we really want another of such adventure I mean otherwise you see this is just a waste of money you are using that I mean when we do this militaristic thing we do three things we keep the military happy and busy because they want to have a mission as they say we terminate to the military industrial complex which is just wasting money but that's that's something which we do and then of course we also make all kinds of pundits expert intellectuals journalists etc we can be happy that they can celebrate the European Union and this new mission and his new meaning to Europe etc meanwhile the citizens are fed up with Europe they are going to be enthusiastic about you hop because of that this is a completely bureaucratic interview and it has nothing to do with the people the concern of the people etc and so it continues the absurdity of the European construction I'm sorry this is a this is bound to be a failure of course it will exist in that sense it will be a success but you know what's going to are what is it going to accomplish preserve peace we don't have war we don't have any danger of war the only problem is terrorism and that's not going to help fight terrorism well it's also look at some of the individual concerns I mean Poland has concerns about pesco with the foreign minister saying that the country's military may fall into foreign hands I mean how realistic is that as a concern you mean they are concerned that this is weakening NATO hmm do you see the problem is that of course Pisco Pisco is not going to defend Europe alone without NATO I mean the problem is that you have given the relationship of forces Europe doesn't need to be defended I think there was no European army whatsoever Russia would not invade us because invading our country means occupying it and it means you know governing it if you really colonize a country then you have to govern it you must realize that in Iraq Afghanistan Syria etc we are not governing those country you've been destroying them and the old colonial is not even the control of the Soviet Union of our Eastern Europe was of course forcing people to you know take care of the country that they occupy or the control but the Russians not have any desire I think to take care of Poland why would they do that and so I see no reason whatsoever I mean of course the poles are hysterical about the Russians but that's an old story that the poles not like the Russian so this take every opportunity to stir up hostility towards Russia but and of course there are historical reason for that but I don't think there is any reason in the present for that and that's always what matters what is the situation at present Russia is not the Soviet Union doesn't have its strength and doesn't have its ambitions and even the Soviet Union it's a complicated story so I mean it seems to me that this is just pure bureaucratic bureaucracy going wild and of course there is a risk of war if you wish because increasing military odds always involves response from the other P other side and then an accident can happen but you know unless they want to plan a new war against whom I don't know I mean you see recently they have ridiculed themselves the West has ridiculed itself by either accepting or moving the Ambassador US Embassy to Tel Aviv annex to to Jerusalem and said in Jerusalem as the capital of Europe having very Marilyn responds this is a real concern yes sorry John well I'm afraid we're going to have to wrap it up there political commentator Jean bricmont thank you very much indeed for your thoughts thank you
