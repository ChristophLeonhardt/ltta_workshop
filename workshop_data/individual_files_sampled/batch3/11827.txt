hi I'm Max Keiser this is the Kaiser report hey how would you like to sound like you live in Los Angeles one easy lesson repeat after me the 405 was jammed I had to take the 101 Stacy I'm not sure if that technically works but one is always at least half hour late here because the traffic is way worse always than even your Google Maps tells you so nevertheless while we've been in LA of course I want to stay on a story that nobody else has covered except for some of the print media we're gonna look at this because something happened at the UN General Assembly behind all the big headlines about the big crazy stuff that you know in Trump speech and stuff like that there was one thing that happened and it comes from Africa and it's a story about China and Africa first I'm going to start with this surprising story from the Ghana news and it reads China Africa relations is not colonialism a coup fo auto tells u n president Nana auto Dunkwa a coup fo ATO mounted the podium at the United Nations headquarters in New York and told the world to discard any notion that the movement of Ghana and some African countries towards China would result in the recolonization of the continent by a new power quote this is not a uniquely Ghanaian or African phenomenon it has not been lost on us that the developed rich and well-established countries have been paying regular visits to China and seeking to open new economic ties and improve upon existing ones he noted so a lot of people are telling African nations you shouldn't deal with China you shouldn't let them build your infrastructure you shouldn't let them invest in you because it's just colonization and he's pointing out the hypocrisy that well why do all these why is Google building dragonfly for them why are all these trade representatives traveling to China and trying to open up deals in China why can't we do deals at China right they recognize the difference between trade and colonization so trade is like for like Africa is getting something in return in their trade relations with chyna colonialization is like we take all your natural resources and you get nothing that's colonialization but Africa does not have the perception that that's what's going on because it's easy to understand that what they're getting from China has enduring value it's hard money probably you could put it in those terms and so it has enduring trade value going forward and this is what is lost on the countries like the United States which is mired in the perception fiat money where you get something for nothing some of the last shows we've done where they have this sort of thing of they don't actually want to help people they want to like feel good about themselves and by giving them some money giving them some Aid and not actually developing it here the gun and president says that we in Ghana must build roads bridges railways ports schools and hospitals and we must create jobs to keep our young people engaged he noted also that you know we for the past few decades we've lived under this Western sort of aid system and nothing has happened we haven't grown we're still in this situation and we need some more we need infrastructure we need infrastructure upon which to develop an economy but without that we're not gonna get further ahead right once again I mean they are going to engage in trade which is peaceful the u.s. is building military bases in Africa that is a war based economy China wants to be a trade based economy going forward into the 21st century which one will prosper well well I think we're going to find out here's the Washington Post take on the story and as surprisingly if they do see that China in Africa has been fantastic for competition because remember part of the situation that you and I have discussed about what's gone wrong with the global economy is when the Soviet Union collapsed they collapse because their system could not compete with capitalism but it did also make us lazy because we didn't have anybody to challenge our ideology and our policies with a different perhaps better policy forcing us up our game this is why competition is good China is offering no-strings-attached aid to Africa here's what that means you know China has just recently given a sixty billion dollars worth of loans and aid to Africa no strings attached it seems like a lot of money they point out but that's just a blow that 0.7% target by the OECD countries to invest in aid and development and in developing nations and this is only 0.49 percent of China's GDP but China's rise as a major donor and investor in Africa the Washington Post points out has led to renewed competition in the continent the European Union for example launched the Africa EU strategic partnership in 2007 and pledged to mobilize more than fifty four billion dollars in sustainable investment for Africa by 2020 in July 2018 the US Congress passed the better utilization of investments leading to Development Act to compete with China's growing presence in Africa so driving competition has been good for Africa it's been good for basically the EU and US corporations that have to compete with these Chinese investments right competition in trade is peaceful and it promotes peace trade is the peaceful way that humans have evolved for hundreds of thousands of millions of years and so in Africa really the cradle of humanity the cradle of Homo sapiens is we understand that our role on planet earth is now ready to take on all comers as they begin to enter the 21st century with such advantages that they have like leapfrogging all the fiat money banking system right into cryptocurrency so they're ready to be really a huge growth story in 21st century yep again so they point out again that the competition between donors has led to great outcomes in Africa and then the Washington Post asked what comes first good governance or development so this is the no-strings-attached thing so China does not try to impose any sort of restrictions on their aid in relation to things like government corruption or government institutions or like cultural differences so here they look at some studies so this is the Washington Post again remember they say one question to ask is whether good governance leads to economic development this is one of the underlying assumptions of making aid conditional some scholars suggest the causal arrow may actually be reversed that is some initial level if economic development is needed to enable institutions of good governance to generate further growth and development in fact China's own development trajectory demonstrates that the relationship between governance and growth cannot be simplified as a chicken or egg situation that's patently obvious because trade comes before governance because trade only works if both parties feel like they're getting a fair deal if one party does not feel they're getting a fair deal then trade collapses and none of the benefits of trade occurs there ask me it like for like it's called hard money it's called the evolution of the trade as part of our DNA as humans and governance is an abstract it's a construct it does not predate trade then you end up with a Soviet Union type of situation they're trying to create the perfect governance and then trade comes later that does not work so they follow up with this with more evidence and more studies showing that economic development first then governance recent evidence shows that China can help countries such as Kenya and Ethiopia realize such initial growth through investment industrialization a study based on extensive fieldwork in Africa similarly concludes that quote China's growing involvement is strongly positive for Africa's economies governments and workers on a broader scale scholars have found that Chinese funded infrastructure projects result in increased economic activities and reduced inequality so remember our model helps a lot of people in Seattle in San Francisco in Los Angeles and Washington DC in particular feel very good about themselves of teaching these people how to behave and they clean that they're their end game is to bring in equipment to reduce inequality but here they're showing that the Chinese just like trusting these people to want to engage in trade but you want to want to not have violence want to not be told that you guys are deplorable and until you stop acting deplorable we're not going to give you any more money so there in fact that these studies done by Western institutions and universities have found that in fact the Chinese model seems to be doing better than our I feel good about myself because I work for the World Bank or I work for the IMF I work for some sort of NGO look in America it's a similar situation like Airbnb reinvented lodging there were regulations didn't come till much later crypto would happen before there regulations will never occur because it's totally self regulated you know uber happened and it was completely unregulated and it's changing the regulatory framework financial innovation first regulations second Africa saying we want to be a start-up continent we want to do trade first do the regulations later to any extent that we need regulations but you don't want government first that's called socialism and it never works it never will work you want trade first that's in our DNA goes back a million years it'll always be that case people want like for like they want to have a communication they want to have interaction we trade biological information to propel the species we trade language with your photosynthesis we're trading carbon for oxygen you know the trade is in our DNA not governance governance is not part of the reality you never will be so here again we're from covering Africa Africa's is welcoming this investment from China we covered recently that Latin American leaders afraid of course because of the bloody history there of invasions and coos and stuff like that they haven't spoken on the record but like this guy did in the UN but they've said like they're welcoming Chinese money because the US has abandoned them and they're they're not investing in things like infrastructure now here's another competitive story a country ignored long by Western investors but now is on the on the radar of Western investors u.s. confirms effort to stop Kwame in Papua New Guinea the u.s. is working to stop Chinese telecom giant Huawei from building a major Internet infrastructure project in Papua New Guinea in the latest sign of international efforts to curb China's broadening influence in the Pacific the u.s. was working alongside Japan and Australia to develop a counteroffer to highways plans u.s. charged a fair James Caruso told Australia state broadcaster on Friday this is not to say don't do business with China it is up to us to be competitive he says so they're trying to come up with a better project for the indo-pacific region because China's is moving in there fast with all of those Treasuries and us acids and financial assets that they need to spend and they're building a network classic end of empire the u.s. is trying to cling to this idea of the US dollar reserve currency empire that they built over post-world war ii era where everyone gets into debt to the america and pays homage to America China Russia Iran Africa you can name it they're all saying no we want mercantilism even Trump wants mercantilism we want to treat we want to trade directly bilaterally we don't want to be part of the globalization anymore but also I think it's establishing Papua New Guinea who's ever talked about that that's never even discussed nobody cares about it it's only the simple hubristic sort of big deals so it's US and Europe or you know the NAFTA and it's nobody wants it so all these other countries smaller countries smaller economies still developing have apparently been left out they feel abandoned they want to make their economies great again they want to participate in globalization because they could all see on Twitter and Facebook and other meet social media that the world is moving forward and they want to be part of it but unless they can get capital in this world of capitalism they need you know they need to go wherever the deal is and whoever will build the infrastructure for them to be connected onto the global highway that is global trade Papua New Guinea you're doing you're on the right track will come to see you Papua New Guinea we're on our way the flight leaving tomorrow we got to take a break when we come back more coming away don't go away welcome back to the castle report I'm Max Keiser time now to go to Steve Beauregard welcome Steve hey max good to see you again I would say you're one of the first generation oh geez original gangster Bitcoin and crypto and we've known each other for a long time and when we're in Los Angeles you know I guess you wanted the founders of silicon beach right so I can beat the loss about silicon beach briefly yeah we're now sort of calling it blockchain beach but back in the day we started a place called bit drop list where we were bringing all the Bitcoin companies in and a go coin took the master lease on that but unfortunately mount GOx happened and nobody else could pay their rent so that kind of imploded but I think it'd be a great thing now but there's so much momentum around town now you can't go into even a local bar or pub now without hearing blockchain Bitcoin yo is this that it all comes up yeah it's everywhere it's so tell us a little bit more about go coin and then block yeah go coins to him real well so there's growing their merchants base so it's for online payments as you know and we're taking a bunch of new cryptocurrencies not just Bitcoin litecoin and dogecoin like the old days we know about a Bitcoin cash soon at aetherium we've had a - we had a couple of others up our sleeve so we're just kind of picking them slowly and strategically you know I talked about - for a second because you know one of the greatest things about crypto is that it can help people that are unbanked or going through incredible financial duress and in Venezuela and now Argentina - in the - community have really made inroads and they're really introducing crypto and it's really making a huge difference politically do you think that's a wave now in 2018 we're gonna see build going forward yeah I do I do I think that we're gonna see more Kryptos sort of strategically move into different spaces and I've always said it's gonna be the multi token multi chain world and these are all networks I mean then and they they're going to expand that the pace are going to expand but a lot of people are all Bitcoin purists think it's you know winner-take-all but I like - I like the project I like the team and it's one of the reasons we added them to go point right they have that governance model we're part of the mining applicants right there and we've seen like cheap air is one of our merchants and they get a lot of - you know purchases on they're cheap air right right and so go coin is processing essentially for crypto and merchants sign up that's right and they can take crypto and where do you see the trends in the US what are we going to see like uber or a big big or Amazon or somebody really get into this in a big way you know you would know you're on the front line Steve tell us what's happening you know I'm a little shocked they haven't already it's really pretty surprising to me that we haven't seen in an uber coin or one of these guys but I think some of that is there's a lot of uncertainty from the regulatory areas and then you get the state by state regulatory overtop of the federal but I think in the next two years you're gonna see one of these big players step in because it's just it's gonna get frothy again yeah the froth you know we're in a retrenchment you and I've been through three at least three seventy eighty percent crashes yep and that's been kind of the nature of Bitcoin since the last big there's the 2014 mount God's crash you know you reference that that was a huge one and now we've got this 2017 2018 move back you know that 2017 period could be taught it said in terms of the ICEA the initial coin offering right and what's your view on the initial point offering and what's the future of that what are your thoughts there yeah I think a lot of people just were victimized by the pump and dumps of a lot of the coins that went out a lot of the big buyers would say hey we're gonna hold these for a long time and what they turned out to do is when they got issued their tokens they turn around wait for the right time and then we dump them back into the market and then move on to the next one so I think there was some you know regulatory oversight did start to come in and there's a lot of sort of guidance given and I think that was a good thing for the market so now what seems to be more popular is what they're calling these stos which is the security token offerings right sto security token offering so how is that different yeah so the difference is where the utility token is kind of like you know you want to go to the carnival and you want to get on the rides you need those tokens in order to get on the rides the security token is actually a piece of equity in the company so it's just like any other issuing the difference is now you'll have more available liquidity to your to your token so that's basically just an equity offering right but by joking izing it your took okay so you're putting securities on the blockchain right so how is the SEC I mean that falls directly under their purview I would say that's right that's right and so it's just like any other offering you know you have reg D you know reggae and what they call reggae plus so every time I hear the reggae all I think of this Marley it's right in Jamaica doing the reggae Mon and so you have now interestingly now I found this out recently you are an Airbnb super host yes we are so tell me what that means and you have a property in Malibu and what's interesting is that the company is trying to offer to their super hosts equity in Airbnb so let's talk about this a little bit yeah it's interesting it's really my wife Lee Fox that's what she spends a lot of her time managing that property and really does a fantastic job with it and but the the idea here is that you'll be able to as an owner of one of these properties and hosting with Airbnb is get equity in the company just like an employee would you had equity and a company they work for even though you're not an employee as an Airbnb host in a way it's sort of the new economy sharing economy type of an employee so it's a different way it's like the next generation of an employee yeah it's interesting because people are talking about these gig economy employees and workers and they're underpaid and they're not really getting a big wage and the company itself doesn't even classify these workers as employees or independent independent contractors but it seems that giving equity to more people there's a way to get more people involved in this economy in America that is driven by financialization it's not driven by wages I mean it used to be wages in the 70s and 80s maybe right but since the 80s the America's gone into a period of pure financialization and everything is traded and tokenized so an easy way to get folks involved would be okay we're just going to give you a piece of equity it doesn't really cut in if companies are buying back their own stock with money they're browing for nothing from the central bank why can't these companies give some equity away to people who were actually doing the work to build the value in these companies Steve absolutely they shouldn't have to be an accredited investor I mean the little guy who's driving around the uber he's acting almost like he works for the company but he has no ability to get you know an equity ownership in that company based on his unless he's you know secretly has a million dollars somewhere or made two hundred fifty thousand dollars of last year the Reg D requirements he doesn't meet them so he can't buy the stock and so this you're just gifting that essentially gifting the stock in their account and now their equity participants I mean the companies that have tried equity ownership have done well and the companies that pay well done have done well here in the in Los Angeles the in-and-out burger where they pay their folks very well and it's a belove chain and there's very little turnover right and companies that offer equity do do well what why doesn't that message get through to a wider spectrum why is why is Amazon you know think that having one guy with a two hundred and sixty billion dollars right and having guys who on the floor having the plastic bottles right I don't get it why is that what are your thoughts on that yeah and that's our that's an interesting one I I don't begrudge anybody who's been very successful in their ability to build up as much wealth as they can but I do think there is a definitely give back there's a point at which you got to look at your employees you have to look at what they're offering to the company and collectively you're going to build more loyalty among those employees by you know cutting them in on it if you will so what's happening at block block a lot of exciting things at block as you probably know we launched metronome about a month and a half ago and that was our new foundational cryptocurrency and that's the first of its type Dow project you know what call it distribute the autonomous organization and it's it's a group of smart contracts that anybody can trade against the metronome pair metronome meter pair 24 by 7 it's all out there available trading pair without going through an exchange okay so the first day that was launched on the ethereum blockchain was spectacularly problematic or a crash or a problem what we threw like what what was learned there and what's happened and you guys obviously evolved and right what what so what did you learn from that and why is this different yeah the main lesson is really you have to audit your code and set it up to multiple audits of the code so we had the top auditors in the world I look at the metronome code and come back we made a couple of fine Tunes but thankfully our team did a bang-up job and it went into production it's behaving exactly as we expected it daily supply auction every single day is available so comes out at twice the price of the previous day and then it descends down to a descending price auction and a fascinating project and so anyone interested metronome IO the owner's manual great read chef Garza did a fantastic job architecting this all right so you know you talk about metronome when we talked about go coin and they take multiple coins you know there is a bit of a political split in the crypto space in the Bitcoin space you have the Bitcoin maximalists right you know who are very die-hard and they have a very I would say dim view of anything that's not Bitcoin and the other camp is basically more in the laissez-faire let let the market decide well let's just bring out some different coins in the middle would be a kind of an argument that the market is so so fresh so young and that the learning curve for the average person is pretty steep and so it's maybe too much of an obstacle at this point to confuse the market with so many different offerings you know instead of just focusing on one and we saw this played out with Bitcoin cash where this was an attempt to really dominate Bitcoin right and almost take over Bitcoin and fortunately the protocol is designed in such a genius way and the incentives are balanced so brilliantly that it repelled yes this hostile act is are there a statement there's an absolute fair statement but what I like about Bitcoin cash is by forking that Network you now have people now aligned with the coin that they want to be aligned with they have the governance that they want and bitcoin is the governance that they want and so Bitcoin cash got to say look we're going to increase the block size and it's paid off for them their transaction times are faster their fees are lower so they can do some things that Bitcoin isn't very good at like transactions okay well maneuver into that second layer now with the lightning networks and other development where do you think that it's just a matter of bitcoins lag time kind of spawned this altcoin market with Manero different features and people said yeah we can't wait anymore we're impatient right and one thing that's great about Bitcoin of course is the creator is anonymous right we don't know who it is these other coins they have some personalities yes and it like Vitalik over at the etherium you've got Roger ver Bitcoin cash etc is that working against these coins to some degree or what's your thoughts on that that's interesting I think to some degree there is sort of the the cult of personality that grows around you know characters like that I know vitalik and Roger both reasonably well and both really great guys so nothing personal against them but you know they're there they do get a following and that ends up taking a personality that also as an ethos that goes into into the coin and what the governance is going to look like great stable it's good to have you back on so I guess I should you mention because Geico coin is the place for merchants anywhere in the world right that's right do you want to take crypto and join the revolution go to go coin thanks man the Kaiser report all right thank you all right well that's gonna do it for this edition of the cars report with me Max Keiser and Stacy Herbert want to think our guest Steve Beauregard of go coin and Block B loq you're gonna reach us on Twitter it's guys report it's the next time bye Oh
