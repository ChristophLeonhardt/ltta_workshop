1
00:00:00,516 --> 00:00:00,982
CHANGE THE LAWS.

2
00:00:00,983 --> 00:00:03,685
THEY LIKE HIM.

3
00:00:03,686 --> 00:00:05,353
>> Melissa: ERIC, LET ME START

4
00:00:05,354 --> 00:00:06,288
WITH YOU.

5
00:00:06,289 --> 00:00:07,189
IT'S LOGICAL THAT THE U.N. WOULD

6
00:00:07,190 --> 00:00:10,525
GO DOWN THERE AND IT SET UP A

7
00:00:10,526 --> 00:00:13,495
PLACE TO PROCESS PEOPLE, TO LOOK

8
00:00:13,496 --> 00:00:14,696
FOR REFUGEES AND WHERE THEY

9
00:00:14,697 --> 00:00:17,332
SHOULD GO, WHY WASN'T THIS DONE

10
00:00:17,333 --> 00:00:17,666
BEFORE?

11
00:00:17,667 --> 00:00:19,100
>> BEFORE THEY HAD TO TRAVEL

12
00:00:19,101 --> 00:00:21,303
THROUGH AN ENTIRE COUNTRY WHICH

13
00:00:21,304 --> 00:00:23,104
IS A FAIRLY LONG COUNTRY.

14
00:00:23,105 --> 00:00:24,706
ISN'T IT A RELIEF?

15
00:00:24,707 --> 00:00:26,041
ASIDE FROM SENDING THE MILITARY

16
00:00:26,042 --> 00:00:28,109
TO OUR BORDER, ASIDE FROM

17
00:00:28,110 --> 00:00:29,911
SETTING UP REFUGEE CAMPS ON OUR

18
00:00:29,912 --> 00:00:31,479
BORDER, ISN'T IT A GREAT RELIEF

19
00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:34,216
THAT HE ALSO SAID, YOU KNOW, WE

20
00:00:34,217 --> 00:00:35,884
WILL STOP FUNDING ALL THE

21
00:00:35,885 --> 00:00:36,818
COUNTRIES WHO AREN'T HELPING.

22
00:00:36,819 --> 00:00:39,020
WE GIVE HUNDREDS AND HUNDREDS OF

23
00:00:39,021 --> 00:00:39,754
BILLIONS OF DOLLARS OF FOREIGN

24
00:00:39,755 --> 00:00:42,023
AID EVERY YEAR TO COUNTRIES

25
00:00:42,024 --> 00:00:43,458
AROUND THE WORLD.

26
00:00:43,459 --> 00:00:44,192
IRAN GAVE HUNDREDS OF BILLIONS

27
00:00:44,193 --> 00:00:46,728
OF DOLLARS TO IRAN, A COUNTRY

28
00:00:46,729 --> 00:00:47,796
WHO ABSOLUTELY HATES OUR GUTS

29
00:00:47,797 --> 00:00:49,865
AND LOOK WHAT WE GET FOR IT?

30
00:00:49,866 --> 00:00:52,300
WE GIVE SO MUCH FOREIGN AID TO

31
00:00:52,301 --> 00:00:54,102
COUNTRIES AROUND THE WORLD,

32
00:00:54,103 --> 00:00:56,137
MILLIONS TO HONDURAS AND ALL

33
00:00:56,138 --> 00:00:56,671
THESE COUNTRIES.

34
00:00:56,672 --> 00:00:58,907
HE SAYS, YOU KNOW WHAT?

35
00:00:58,908 --> 00:00:59,641
I WILL STOP GIVING YOU FOREIGN

36
00:00:59,642 --> 00:01:01,543
AID IF YOU DON'T TAKE CARE OF

37
00:01:01,544 --> 00:01:02,544
THIS PROBLEM.

38
00:01:02,545 --> 00:01:04,212
MAKE SURE THIS DOESN'T SHOW UP

39
00:01:04,212 --> 00:01:05,547
ON OUR SOUTHERN BORDER.

40
00:01:05,548 --> 00:01:07,916
>> Melissa: PEOPLE WOULD SAY

41
00:01:07,917 --> 00:01:08,516
THAT'S HEARTLESS.

42
00:01:08,517 --> 00:01:09,351
>> Eric Trump: IT'S NOT

43
00:01:09,352 --> 00:01:10,051
HEARTLESS AT ALL.

44
00:01:10,052 --> 00:01:11,853
YOU HAVE TO PROTECT THE COUNTRY,

45
00:01:11,854 --> 00:01:13,622
YOU HAVE TO PROTECT THE BORDER.

46
00:01:13,623 --> 00:01:14,756
THERE'S AN ARTICLE THAT CAME OUT

47
00:01:14,757 --> 00:01:16,391
THAT SAID THAT THEY FOUND OVER

48
00:01:16,392 --> 00:01:18,560
100 ICES MEMBERS AND ONE OF

49
00:01:18,561 --> 00:01:19,361
THESE COUNTRIES.

50
00:01:19,362 --> 00:01:20,228
THOSE PEOPLE COULD CLEARLY BE

51
00:01:20,229 --> 00:01:22,664
COMING UP THROUGH THE BORDER AS

52
00:01:22,665 --> 00:01:23,798
WELL, IT'S NOT HEARTLESS.

53
00:01:23,799 --> 00:01:26,568
YOU HAVE A COUNTRY, THEY COME

54
00:01:26,569 --> 00:01:28,470
INTO THIS COUNTRY ILLEGALLY.

55
00:01:28,471 --> 00:01:30,105
I'M THE PRODUCT OF IMMIGRATION.

56
00:01:30,106 --> 00:01:32,207
PEOPLE SAY THEY ARE

57
00:01:32,208 --> 00:01:33,441
ANTI-IMMIGRANT OR YOU ARE

58
00:01:33,442 --> 00:01:33,808
ANTI-THIS.

59
00:01:33,809 --> 00:01:37,712
MY MOM WASN'T BORN IN THE

60
00:01:37,713 --> 00:01:38,313
UNITED STATES.

61
00:01:38,314 --> 00:01:39,514
MY FATHER'S CURRENT WIFE WASN'T

62
00:01:39,515 --> 00:01:40,282
BORN IN THE U.S.

63
00:01:40,283 --> 00:01:42,717
BUT THEY CAME INTO THE COUNTRY

64
00:01:42,718 --> 00:01:43,285
LEGALLY.

65
00:01:43,286 --> 00:01:44,552
THEY LEARNED THE LANGUAGE, THEY

66
00:01:44,553 --> 00:01:46,488
TOOK THE TESTS, THEY DID

67
00:01:46,489 --> 00:01:47,656
EVERYTHING THAT THEY NEEDED TO

68
00:01:47,657 --> 00:01:48,089
DO.

69
00:01:48,090 --> 00:01:50,325
YOU CAN'T JUST HAVE 4,000 PEOPLE

70
00:01:50,326 --> 00:01:51,927
WALK INTO A COUNTRY.

71
00:01:51,928 --> 00:01:53,595
IN THOSE COUNTRIES NEED TO

72
00:01:53,596 --> 00:01:56,097
CONTROL THEIR OWN POPULATIONS.

73
00:01:56,098 --> 00:01:57,499
>> WE FOUND OUT THAT THERE IS A

74
00:01:57,500 --> 00:01:59,935
NEW STUDY DONE BY A YALE MIT

75
00:01:59,936 --> 00:02:01,736
RESEARCH ARE THE ESTIMATES ARE

76
00:02:01,737 --> 00:02:03,071
22 MILLION ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS IN

77
00:02:03,072 --> 00:02:05,106
THIS COUNTRY WHICH IS ROUGHLY

78
00:02:05,107 --> 00:02:06,107
DOUBLE WHAT THE STATED NUMBER

79
00:02:06,108 --> 00:02:06,374
IS.

80
00:02:06,375 --> 00:02:09,511
I THINK THAT WHAT IS GOING ON

81
00:02:09,512 --> 00:02:10,312
WITH MEXICO, AND WORKING WITH

82
00:02:10,312 --> 00:02:11,413
THE UNITED NATIONS

83
00:02:11,414 --> 00:02:14,049
UNITED NATIONS, AGAIN, IT

84
00:02:14,050 --> 00:02:16,851
TAKES -- IT WHACKS AT THAT KIND

85
00:02:16,852 --> 00:02:20,522
OF NARRATIVE FROM THE DERANGED,

86
00:02:20,523 --> 00:02:22,490
LIBERAL LEFT, THE

87
00:02:22,491 --> 00:02:23,191
PRESIDENT TRUMP HATES MEXICO.

88
00:02:23,192 --> 00:02:25,093
AND IT SPEAKS TO WHAT HAS BEEN

89
00:02:25,094 --> 00:02:26,661
GOING ON WITH MEXICO.

90
00:02:26,662 --> 00:02:28,296
WE HAVE INCREASED THE CREDIT

91
00:02:28,297 --> 00:02:30,598
LINE AVAILABLE TO MEXICO, UPPING

92
00:02:30,599 --> 00:02:32,334
IT TO $9 BILLION.

93
00:02:32,335 --> 00:02:34,536
AND WHAT HAPPENED WITH THE

94
00:02:34,537 --> 00:02:35,303
RENEGOTIATION OF NAFTA?

95
00:02:35,304 --> 00:02:36,504
THE FIRST PORTION OF THAT IS

96
00:02:36,505 --> 00:02:39,708
GOING TO LIFT WORKERS IN THAT

97
00:02:39,709 --> 00:02:41,776
COUNTRY, IT WILL LIFT WAGES FOR

98
00:02:41,777 --> 00:02:43,878
AUTO WORKERS IN MEXICO, AND THAT

99
00:02:43,879 --> 00:02:46,348
PIECE GOT DONE BEFORE EVEN

100
00:02:46,349 --> 00:02:46,881
CANADA.

101
00:02:46,882 --> 00:02:48,049
SO AGAIN, WHAT IS HAPPENING WITH

102
00:02:48,050 --> 00:02:50,685
OUR SOUTHERN NEIGHBOR IS PRETTY

103
00:02:50,686 --> 00:02:51,953
INCREDIBLE IN TERMS OF HOW THIS

104
00:02:51,954 --> 00:02:55,090
RELATIONSHIP CAME DOWN.

105
00:02:55,091 --> 00:02:55,790
>> Eric Trump: THE DEMOCRATS

106
00:02:55,791 --> 00:03:00,061
RAN ON THIS NOTION THAT TRUMP,

107
00:03:00,062 --> 00:03:01,863
YOU ARE ANTI-HISPANIC OR

108
00:03:01,864 --> 00:03:04,199
ANTI-THIS OR ANTI-THAT, AND

109
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:04,966
RECESS, ANY OTHER WORD YOU COULD

110
00:03:04,967 --> 00:03:08,303
THINK OF THEY THREW THERE.

111
00:03:08,304 --> 00:03:09,404
WE SEE THAT WHEN THE PRESIDENT

112
00:03:09,405 --> 00:03:11,106
OF THE COUNTRY COMES OUT AND

113
00:03:11,107 --> 00:03:15,143
SAYS, THIS IS WHAT THEY DID.

114
00:03:15,144 --> 00:03:18,246
THE FIRST PEOPLE WILLING TO SIT

115
00:03:18,247 --> 00:03:20,248
THERE AND RENEGOTIATE NAFTA,

116
00:03:20,249 --> 00:03:26,021
THEIR RELATIONSHIP IS INCREDIBL

117
00:03:26,022 --> 00:03:26,421
INCREDIBLE.

118
00:03:26,422 --> 00:03:28,189
THIS IS ONE OF THE BEST THINGS

119
00:03:28,190 --> 00:03:30,959
THAT WE CAN DO, EMPOWER THE

120
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:31,693
MEXICAN GOVERNMENT TO TAKE CARE

121
00:03:31,694 --> 00:03:35,196
OF THEMSELVES AND IT BE THAT

122
00:03:35,197 --> 00:03:38,299
FROM CENTRAL AMERICA.

123
00:03:38,300 --> 00:03:39,067
CENTRAL AMERICA EVEN MORE SO

124
00:03:39,068 --> 00:03:39,834
THAN MEXICO IS THE CHALLENGE

125
00:03:39,835 --> 00:03:42,637
WHERE YOU HAVE GANGS, OR YOU

126
00:03:42,638 --> 00:03:47,075
HAVE HUMAN RIGHTS ISSUES.

127
00:03:47,076 --> 00:03:51,479
AND WE CAN ACTUALLY PARTNER WITH

128
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:52,714
THE NEW UNITED NATIONS OR

129
00:03:52,715 --> 00:03:53,882
GOVERNMENT OF MEXICO.

130
00:03:53,883 --> 00:03:55,116
THAT NOT ONLY HELPS THE

131
00:03:55,117 --> 00:03:56,117
UNITED STATES BUT MEXICO, AND

132
00:03:56,118 --> 00:03:59,854
THOSE THAT ARE TRYING TO BE

133
00:03:59,855 --> 00:04:09,497
MIGRANTS AND FIND A WAY OUT.

134
00:04:09,498 --> 00:04:11,966
AND WHAT WE CAN DO IS WORK WITH

135
00:04:11,967 --> 00:04:12,700
THE MEXICAN GOVERNMENT AND THE

136
00:04:12,701 --> 00:04:16,071
UNITED NATIONS TO FIND OUT A WAY

137
00:04:16,072 --> 00:04:16,805
TO PROTECT THOSE INDIVIDUALS AND

138
00:04:16,805 --> 00:04:21,475
TO GIVE A SAFE HARBOR.

139
00:04:21,476 --> 00:04:25,880
>> YOU ALSO HAVE TO TAKE INTO

140
00:04:25,881 --> 00:04:27,115
ACCOUNT THOSE THINGS.

141
00:04:27,116 --> 00:04:28,216
WHAT'S HEARTLESS AS SENDING YOUR

142
00:04:28,217 --> 00:04:29,717
CHILD ALONE THROUGH MEXICO TO BE

143
00:04:29,718 --> 00:04:31,753
PAIRED UP WITH A SMUGGLER OR

144
00:04:31,754 --> 00:04:32,620
SOMEONE CLAIMING TO BE THEIR

145
00:04:32,621 --> 00:04:32,954
PARENTS.

146
00:04:32,955 --> 00:04:36,191
THERE HAVE BEEN MULTIPLE CASES

147
00:04:36,192 --> 00:04:37,892
AND MULTIPLE STORIES SINCE THE

148
00:04:37,893 --> 00:04:38,927
WHOLE OUTRAGE OVER THE CHILD

149
00:04:38,928 --> 00:04:41,463
MINOR CRISIS SHOWING THAT THE

150
00:04:41,464 --> 00:04:42,697
PARENT OF THE LITTLE GIRL OR

151
00:04:42,698 --> 00:04:43,832
LITTLE BOY THAT WAS BROUGHT FROM

152
00:04:43,833 --> 00:04:47,202
HONDURAS OR GUATEMALA WAS BEING

153
00:04:47,203 --> 00:04:47,969
SEXUALLY ABUSED AND MOLESTED BY

154
00:04:47,970 --> 00:04:48,837
THE PARENT WHO HAD NO DNA

155
00:04:48,838 --> 00:04:50,839
CONNECTION TO THE KID.

156
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:57,779
THE PROBLEM IS, ACCORDING TO THE

157
00:04:57,780 --> 00:04:58,513
U.S. LAW, THE PRESIDENT IS DOING

158
00:04:58,514 --> 00:04:59,214
EVERYTHING HE CAN THROUGH THE

159
00:04:59,215 --> 00:05:00,849
EXECUTIVE BRANCH, TELLING MEXICO

160
00:05:00,850 --> 00:05:08,990
TO HELP US, AND CONGRESS

161
00:05:08,991 --> 00:05:11,326
ESSENTIALLY GIVES THEM FREE

162
00:05:11,327 --> 00:05:13,528
REIGN TO GET INTO THE COUNTRY.

163
00:05:13,529 --> 00:05:18,299
OUR IMMIGRATION LAWS DO NOT

164
00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:19,501
COMPLIED WITH CHILDREN AS A

165
00:05:19,502 --> 00:05:21,402
RESULT OF THE WAY THE LAW IS

166
00:05:21,403 --> 00:05:22,103
WRITTEN RIGHT NOW.

167
00:05:22,104 --> 00:05:23,771
SO IT'S UP TO CONGRESS AS THE

168
00:05:23,772 --> 00:05:25,740
DEMOCRATS POINTED OUT, AND THE

169
00:05:25,741 --> 00:05:27,775
CONGRESS TO DECIDE, DO YOU WANT

170
00:05:27,776 --> 00:05:28,910
CHILDREN TO BE ABUSED AS THEY

171
00:05:28,911 --> 00:05:31,045
ARE COMING UP AS MIGRANTS

172
00:05:31,046 --> 00:05:31,679
THROUGH THIS PROCESS?

173
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:34,516
AND WHY IS IT THAT MEXICAN

174
00:05:34,517 --> 00:05:35,183
CITIZENS ARE SUBJECT TO

175
00:05:35,184 --> 00:05:38,786
DIFFERENT LAWS THAN CITIZENS OF

176
00:05:38,787 --> 00:05:40,922
OTHER SOUTH AMERICAN COUNTRIES?

177
00:05:40,923 --> 00:05:41,723
>> Melissa: I HAVE TO THINK

178
00:05:41,724 --> 00:05:44,859
THAT THERE WAS SOME CONNECTION,

179
00:05:44,860 --> 00:05:45,860
PEOPLE DON'T SEE THE CONNECTION

180
00:05:45,861 --> 00:05:47,028
BETWEEN THE TARIFFS AND THE

181
00:05:47,029 --> 00:05:48,830
TRADE WARS AND THE IDEA WE ARE

182
00:05:48,831 --> 00:05:50,331
TRYING TO NAME RENEGOTIATE TRADE

183
00:05:50,332 --> 00:05:51,799
DEALS, AND THEN THESE OTHER

184
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:52,333
ISSUES.

185
00:05:52,334 --> 00:05:54,536
I HAVE TO THINK THAT EMBEDDED

186
00:05:54,537 --> 00:05:55,737
SOMEWHERE IN THE USMCA WAS ALSO

187
00:05:55,738 --> 00:05:57,539
CONVERSATION ABOUT HOW WE ARE

188
00:05:57,540 --> 00:06:00,542
DEALING WITH THIS OTHER ISSUE?

189
00:06:00,543 --> 00:06:02,343
ARE THOSE TALKS INTERMINGLED?

190
00:06:02,344 --> 00:06:04,946
>> AND PROBABLY OVERALL

191
00:06:04,947 --> 00:06:05,747
RELATIONSHIP MEANING PEOPLE ARE

192
00:06:05,748 --> 00:06:06,981
SITTING DOWN AND TALKING AND

193
00:06:06,982 --> 00:06:08,550
COMING UP WITH SOMETHING THAT

194
00:06:08,551 --> 00:06:09,951
WORKS FOR EVERYBODY.

195
00:06:09,952 --> 00:06:10,752
THINK ABOUT THE RELATIONSHIP

196
00:06:10,753 --> 00:06:12,153
THAT U.S. AND MEXICO COULD HAVE

197
00:06:12,154 --> 00:06:17,892
AND I THINK NOW IS HAVING.

198
00:06:17,893 --> 00:06:19,527
YOU HAVE COUNTRIES LIKE CHINA

199
00:06:19,528 --> 00:06:21,296
THAT HAVE TAKEN JOBS AND

200
00:06:21,297 --> 00:06:22,497
EVERYTHING, THEY ARE HALFWAY

201
00:06:22,498 --> 00:06:23,097
ACROSS THE WORLD.

202
00:06:23,098 --> 00:06:25,733
LOOK AT WHERE MEXICO IS

203
00:06:25,734 --> 00:06:26,134
POSSESSION.

204
00:06:26,135 --> 00:06:27,335
MEXICO HAS SUCH AN INCREDIBLE

205
00:06:27,336 --> 00:06:29,003
OPPORTUNITY IN SO MANY WAYS,

206
00:06:29,004 --> 00:06:31,506
THEY ARE OUR NEIGHBOR.

207
00:06:31,507 --> 00:06:33,708
NO DIFFERENT THAN CANADA.

208
00:06:33,709 --> 00:06:35,910
THAT IS WHAT NAFTA USED TO BE,

209
00:06:35,911 --> 00:06:37,145
WE SHOULD BE ABSOLUTELY TIGHT AT

210
00:06:37,146 --> 00:06:39,514
THE HIP, NOT JUST WITH SOCIAL

211
00:06:39,515 --> 00:06:43,685
ISSUES BUT MILITARY AND

212
00:06:43,686 --> 00:06:44,052
SECURITY.

213
00:06:44,053 --> 00:06:46,321

214
00:06:46,322 --> 00:06:48,456
>> PRESIDENT TRUMP IS ACTUALLY

215
00:06:48,457 --> 00:06:49,324
CLOSER IN HIS IMMIGRATION POLICY

216
00:06:49,325 --> 00:06:50,124
STANDPOINT TO THE MEXICAN

217
00:06:50,125 --> 00:06:52,160
GOVERNMENT ON THE LEFT IS TO THE

218
00:06:52,161 --> 00:06:53,928
MEXICAN GOVERNMENT.

219
00:06:53,929 --> 00:06:54,929
MEXICO DOESN'T WANT CENTRAL

220
00:06:54,930 --> 00:06:55,897
AMERICANS ILLEGALLY EMIGRATING

221
00:06:55,898 --> 00:06:57,832
TO THE COUNTRY EITHER, WHEREAS

222
00:06:57,833 --> 00:07:00,134

00:07:00,135 --> 00:07:01,736
AND INTO THE UNITED STATES.

224
00:07:01,737 --> 00:07:03,338
NOW PRESIDENT TRUMP IS ENGAGING

225
00:07:03,339 --> 00:07:04,739
THE MEXICAN GOVERNMENT AND

226
00:07:04,740 --> 00:07:05,740
ENGAGING THE AMBASSADOR AND

00:07:05,741 --> 00:07:07,642
SAYING, I WANT YOU TO STOP THIS

228
00:07:07,643 --> 00:07:08,343
PROBLEM.

229
00:07:08,344 --> 00:07:09,344
YOU DON'T WANT THIS COUNTRY

230
00:07:09,345 --> 00:07:10,578
STAYING IN YOUR COUNTRY

231
00:07:10,579 --> 00:07:13,181

ARE.

236
00:07:19,154 --> 00:07:20,154
>> WHEN THE PRESIDENT TALKS

237
00:07:20,155 --> 00:07:21,089
ABOUT IMMIGRATION AND WHAT'S

238
00:07:21,090 --> 00:07:22,824
GOING ON IN MEXICO, THAT SPEAKS

239
00:07:22,825 --> 00:07:24,926
DIRECTLY TO HIS FACE.

240
00:07:24,927 --> 00:07:25,793
HOWEVER ITS MIDTERM ELECTION

241
00:07:25,794 --> 00:07:26,995
SEASON AND IT HIGHLIGHTS WHAT

242
00:07:26,996 --> 00:07:28,763
CONGRESS HAS NOT GOT DONE FOR

243
00:07:28,764 --> 00:07:30,465

THAT IS A FIGHT YET TO COME.

249
00:07:37,606 --> 00:07:40,508
THE PRESIDENT SAID HE WILL VETO

250
00:07:40,509 --> 00:07:41,309
IT IF HE DOESN'T HAVE IT AND

251
00:07:41,310 --> 00:07:42,710
