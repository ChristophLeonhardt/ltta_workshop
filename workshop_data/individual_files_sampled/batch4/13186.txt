genius.com so we begin today with the fact that 300 newspapers 300 newspapers across the country have all decided that it is deeply necessary and important to come out against President Trump 300 newspapers all across the country this thing was led by the Boston Globe the Boston Globe coordinated this entire stick and I guess the idea here is to show that the media is not in collusion against President Trump by colluding against President Trump it makes perfect sense all the way across the board the Boston Globe has its own very long editorial all about this and they write a central pillar of President Trump's politics is a sustained assault on the Free Press journalists are not classified as fellow Americans but rather the enemy of the people this relentless assault on the Free Press has dangerous consequences we asked editorial boards from across the country liberal and conservative large and small but mostly liberal to join us today to address this fundamental threats in their own words than their hundreds of editorials and they show some poll results about how much Americans trust the press and what these poll results show it's kind of fascinating is that it's not just a matter of conservatives not trusting the press a lot of people don't trust the press about 26% of all independents say the news media are the enemy of the American people that's registered independents not Republicans not Democrats and when you look at the numbers with regard to for example the New York Times what you see is that only about 37% of independents actually about 37% believe the New York Times is untrustworthy about 60% believe it's trustworthy well you would figure that independence if the New York Times were actually trustworthy independence would be up near 100% are you'd figure Republicans would be 100% against Democrats would be 100% for and independence would be 100% for cuz independents are independent minded instead it turns out that the New York Times can only get about 6 and 10 even from independence but I guess we're supposed to believe that all of the distrust of the media began with President Trump and that's what the Boston Globe says the Boston Globe says that the president is stoking domestic division for political and personal gain he's asking his audiences to follow him into fantasia his they quote President Trump saying this just stick with us don't believe the crap you see from these people the newse just remember what you're seeing in what you're reading is not what's happening and the Boston Globe says this sounds like George Orwell's 1984 the problem of course is that the media have been engaged in undermining their own credibility for quite a while now the the suggestion that the media are just good stewards of the truth and that only when President Trump levels these unfair nasty attacks and people that's when things go wrong it's just not true in any sense there's no evidence for it okay the in fact the evidence is all on the other side Republicans have been anti media since long before I was born you know I was writing about how terrible the media was when I first started writing when I was 17 years old the media has been garbage when it comes to reporting an objective truth for as long as I have been alive and as long as many of the people in this audience have been alive and then they're shocked when President Trump says this is all fake news and then people will start to ignore the news well President Trump wasn't going to leave well enough alone President Trump jumped on Twitter and did what President Trump does best that's right Jude said some crap because that's a shtick right as they say many times on the show the president on his headstone you know when his time comes after 120 years when the president goes on his headstone it'll say 45th presidents of the United States he sent a lot of crap so here is what President Trump had says had to say that the fake news media is the opposition party it is very bad for a great country but we are winning and it's hard not to see the fake news media as the opposition party when 300 of them are coordinating to attack the administration and to attack Trump remember what President Trump has done in terms of policy to crack down on the news media is not even remotely comparable to what the Obama administration actually did to crack down on certain members of the news media they legitimately wiretapped people like James Rosen at Fox News they wiretap The Associated Press so president from says many things but I think a lot of us become background noises the truth most Americans know that when President Trump says stuff it's because he says a lot of stuff but don't worry he said more stuff so here is what he said he said now this one is real galaxy brain I I can't really I pulled over this one for a while and I couldn't come to any clear conclusion as to what it's supposed to say maybe we are just maybe maybe he's operating on a different plane I mean I think he is but I don't think it's the way that most people think is here's why he says the Boston Globe which was sold to the failing New York Times for one point three billion dollars plus eight hundred million dollars in losses and investment or 2.1 billion dollars was then sold by the Times for $1 now the globe is in collusion with other papers and Free Press prove it I sort of feel like Winona Ryder at the Oscars just kind of looking around randomly trying to figure out what exactly this is supposed to mean I mean it is good to know the president can add together 1.3 billion and 800 million that's good hey that part of his math is good but I don't know what the rest of this tweet means I am not I'm not sure and then what I like at the very end is when he says prove it like he's gonna say prove it Inspector Clouseau is gonna bust through the doors like I have the proof right Sherlock Holmes is going to wander in Ozone say sir I've proven it like I don't I don't understand what this is but you know president saying stuff and the stuff continues so he finishes up this way he says there is nothing that I would want more for our country then true freedom of the press the fact is that the press is free to write and say anything it was but much of what it says is fake news pushing a political agenda or just plain trying to hurt people honesty wins okay so again I have a lot of sympathy for this position there's a certain irony just to be perfectly frank and the president placing in all capital letters letters honesty wins but I mean even with that said what he is saying is basically true and the media cannot fathom why it is that so many people do not trust them well the clearest example of why people do not trust the mainstream media to be found is the narrative over the past 48 hours over the taking away of John Brennan security clearance so John Brennan was the head of the CIA under Barack Obama and John Brennan is a garbage heap John Brennan is just terrible John Brendan lied to the American Congress any full-scale lied to them he said that people weren't being surveilled when they were being a surveilled and John Brennan was instrumental in pushing information that was not good enough to actually indict President Trump on or to get the Trump campaign on with regard to collusion he was instrumental in pushing all of that information over to Harry Reid he was instrumental in making sure that all of it hit the press and then he goes on television and he says a lot of things about how collusion is real he has an editorial in the New York Times today about how collusion is real I kid you not write it it's a full-on editorial and the title of it is President Trump's claims of no collusion are hogwash that is the name of the column and then he goes through about 800 words and you're waiting for him to actually prove this thing okay well if you are the big truth teller if you are the great truth teller who ought to retain your security clearance maybe you ought to provide some proof that the collusion actually happened but you get all the way through the article and there's nothing there and here's what he says he says mr. Trump's claims of no collusion are in a word hogwash the only questions that remain are whether the collusion that took place constituted criminally liable conspiracy whether obstruction of justice occurred to cover up any collusion or conspiracy and how many members of Trump incorporated attempted to defraud the government by laundering and concealing the movement of money into their pockets now I need to take that more slowly so you understand how absurd that statement is ray says there's no the claims have no clue janar hogwash the only things we have to know are were there what did collusion happen that's really what he's saying he's saying absolutely collusion happened the only question yet to be answered is whether collusion actually happened and then he cites Paul Manafort who there are no accusations in Paul Manafort trial that Paul Manafort actually colluded with the Russians to affect the election in any way that is not part of Paul Manafort trial by the way Paul Manafort may get off the jury sent a note to the judge today asking the definition of reasonable doubt I used to work in a prosecutor's office that's never a good sign he says that Rick Gates raises Rick Gates has involved inclusion again there is no evidence that Rick Gates is involved in any collusion between the Trump campaign and the Russian government all of the charges with regard to mana four and gates predate their involvement with the Trump campaign but Brendon concludes his piece in The New York Times thusly he says mr. Trump clearly has become more desperate to protect himself in those close to him which is why he made the politically motivated decision to revoke my security clearance in an attempt to scare into silence others who might dare challenge him yes clearly Brennan has been frightened into silence in the pages of the New York Times clearly the president has been over successful at shutting John Brennan down say says that it's important that the special counsel does work so the entire left has come out in support of John Brennan ignoring the fact that John Brennan has been a corrupt official that he has been extraordinarily political since leaving office and honestly there should be a blanket rule that when you leave office and you're no longer part of the administration you probably should lose your security clearance anyway I'm very confused I'm confused by folks who say that there's some sort of right to keep your security security clearance after you leave off it's like do you really think the Trump administration is gonna call up John Brennan for advice it's never going to happen there's no reason for any of that to happen but the media have jumped on this with both feet and we'll get to that in just a second but first let's talk about the possibility of an emergency when an emergency strikes what is your first impulse if your answer is run to the grocery store you're likely to find chaos and nothing but empty shelves how do you avoid all of this well it's pretty easy use today and you make a plan you're prepared and one practical place to start is storing up food in your home you can trust my Patriot supply for your food storage so you'll be ready for earthquakes hurricanes long term power outages and more here's a great special that makes it simple every person in your household should have a two-week emergency food supply from my Patriot supply these kids are just 75 bucks right now they contain 92 servings of breakfasts lunches and dinners take action call eight eight eight eight oh three 14 13 or go to my special website prepare with been calm listen the government recommends they have some food in your house in case of emergency because they may not be able to get to you and you never want to be reliant on the government anyway this makes sure that you and your family are safe if god forbid people can't get to you and you need food the food lasts up to 25 years in storage meals compact in a rugged slimline tote - it is only 75 bucks rest tonight knowing that you're prepared order your food kit 888 803 1413 or at prepare with Ben comm make sure you are not left unprepared prepare with Ben calm so the argument from the left with regard to John Brennan is that John Brennan actually had a right to keep his security clearance now President Trump did what President Trump does as I've said many times he said stuff about this now he didn't actually have to say stuff about this what he should have just said is ya chump Brendan didn't like that guy he worked for the Obama administration don't trust him no security clearance instead he decided that he was going to do a 20-minute impromptu interview with The Wall Street Journal I swear I'm being president from Sandler it's like watching my two and a half year old son hey you just did I'm rooting for him but I know that if I don't watch him for five seconds he's gonna break his face on something so he told the Wall Street Journal during this 20 minute impromptu interview who said I called the rigged witch hunt a sham and these people let it so I think it's something that had to be done okay well that's partially true but the problem is when it makes it look like it's a political hit when it looks like you're pursuing a political hit against your political opponents people are likely going to complain about it and complain that their First Amendment rights have been violated that you're discriminating against them on the basis of their politics from a governmental point of view all he had to do is just say listen John Brennan security clearance is gone instead he listed basically all the people he doesn't like and then he said I'm taking your security security clearance which wasn't supremely smart however the overblown reaction to this is truly something to watch so John Brennan right who is a hysterical hisi just pissy human being John Brennan goes on national television and he starts ranting and raving about tyrants and despots remember this is the guy who lied to the Congress of the United States about whether he is spying on you and he is talking about how it's tyrannical despotism for his security clearance that he hasn't used in over two years to be removed from him John Brennan one of the geniuses of our age I've seen this type of behavior and actions on the part of foreign tyrants and despots and autocrats for many many years during my CIA and a security career I never ever thought that I would see it here in the I stay absolutely how dare somebody remove a piece of paper he wasn't using and that he had no right to have in the first place how dare this happened and the media of course blow this up to gargantuan proportions they find everyone they can to come out and talk about this the latest person who they have brought out to talk about this he's retired Admiral William McRaven most famous for having been the guy who oversaw the the operation that ended with the death of Osama bin Laden so there's a full op-ed in the Washington Post by Admiral McRaven talking about how terrible it is that John Brennan security clearance was removed and here is what his op-ed had to say he said few Americans have done more to protect this country than John he is a man of unparalleled integrity whose honesty and character have never been in question except by those who don't know him and people who watch TV I mean Admiral McRaven did some wonderful things but Admiral McRaven is in fact a Democrat who doesn't like President Trump he's spoken out against President Trump many times before and yet this is being touted as some sort of great evidence that President Trump did something deeply wrong now the hilarious thing is that past administrations have used their power to strip paperwork away from people before you remember early on in the Clinton administration for example they removed a bunch of people in the travel office in the travel office who they didn't like and it's called travelgate nothing ever came of it this sort of thing isn't remarkably uncommon but the fact that media decide to over blow it it's just more evidence that the media are who the media are which is why they feel the necessity to in unison all 300 papers unite and talk about President Trump meanwhile the media have decided that they're going to increase their capacity to to go after President Trump by continuing to push forward Omarosa Manigault so I'm Rosa Manigault will not leave she has now been fired I kid you not she was fired let's see twice by the Clinton administration you know that did you she worked for the she worked for Gore in the Clinton administration she's fired twice by the Clinton administration then she was fired three times on the apprentice and now she's been fired once by the Trump White House and undoubtedly at some point she'll say something nice Trump will hire again and then fire her again so this is I think I think that it is inevitable that she will eventually enter double digits in terms of the number of times that she is fired so she was on MSNBC and she is talking about how she has brand-new tapes now Omarosa is desperate for money this is a woman of course who was most famous for being nearly sociopathic on the Prentis and then Trump in a brilliant piece of hiring decided let's bring her into the White House which was not it didn't quite fall under his rubric of hiring all the best people but he hired her anyway in any case she now has taped everyone in the White House and I talked to folks in the White House and everybody thinks they're on tape from Omarosa because she was pretty much walking around the White House like John Cusack and say anything with a boom box with a tape recorder in it so she went on MSNBC today to talk about her newest tape now her tapes are really big nothing burgers nothing that she's broken via tape so far is really of any worth like she went out her first tape was John Kelly fired me okay right cuz you're terrible of course John Kelly fired you it's just a shot that he hadn't fired you before then there was a tape of her and Trump talking about how Trump didn't know that she was fired and that's just because Trump actually the dirty little secret his Trump doesn't like firing people but he likes other people to fire people for him so there was that tape that came out not a big deal then she has a new tape is it the dastardly and word tape we've been hearing so much about no it's a tape of her talking to Larry Trump right the least known of the Trump's and nice lady but I mean just because her last name is Trump doesn't mean that she is deeply important to American politics in a way that merits this sort of conversation Omarosa releases tape of Lara Trump and what is large from doing she's offering her 15,000 dollars a month to join the campaign which has happened in virtually everyone who's ever left the Trump employ everyone ends up on their feet inside a super PAC org from campaign that's the way politics works Omarosa releases this thing on MSNBC and oh it's the end of the world so here's MSNBC with Omarosa treating her as though she's a whistleblower in a Hollywood movie when all that happened was somebody offered her a bunch of money to go be useless at another place the media treated this as those as a giant payoff oh wow Lehrer Trump is trying to pay off amorosa it's not a giant payoff this is how politics works you leave one place you get a job at another there's nothing special here but the media of course went wild over this and then they wonder why we don't trust them they're so desperate to get Trump that they will do legitimately anything Penn Jillette who's a magician and also a libertarian he was on the apprentice as as one of the people on the apprentice with from and he did an interview in which he talked about Trump says kind of raunchy things off camera which yes we know and then he suggested that he wouldn't actually he didn't think that Trump had said the n-word but he wasn't going to say specifically what he thought Trump is said because he just didn't remember this prompted Stephen Colbert the execrable Stephen Colbert who was Yabu is right Stephen Colbert he decided that he was going to try to get Penn Jillette to say the N word to say that Trump actually said the N word the desperation that just ripples off these people in waves is astonishing look at the desperation in Stephen Colbert trying to convince Penn Jillette to please please provide the political kill shot that will take down the president okay pick through the word that Donald Trump said I want you to picture I want you to picture I want you to picture what that card was do you have it firmly in mind picture picture the word he said do you have the word in mind is this your word this is this is what passes for comedy these days is basically just shouting about how President Trump is a racist and again all this goes back to that fundamental question as to why the media have earned artists trust but it really isn't even the political stuff in which the media has earned our distrust it's the cultural stuff because the truth is it's the media's level of scorn for people like you people like me people like everybody in this audience it's the level of scorn for everybody who does not live in LA or New York or believe the same things that they do it's that level of scorn that really drives our distrust of the media because we feel like every time they make an error there's an agenda behind the error every time they are dishonest it's not just that they've lied about something is that there is a true agenda behind the dishonesty so the best example of this that I could find today was Trevor Noah Trevor Noah who as I've been saying for a long time is in a running gun better indeed boo so Trevor Noah who's been in a running gun battle for least funny human being in the United States with Amy Schumer and Samantha bee Samantha bee is out in front by by a length and then Trevor Noah is is running a narrow second followed by Amy Schumer that says Amy Schumer hasn't made a movie in like three months but it you know all three of them are pretty awful in any in any case Trevor Noah ends on Comedy Central and he decides to go after the Catholic Church now the reason this is bad is not because everybody isn't horrified by the latest stories we talked about it yesterday on the podcast the latest stories about what's going on inside the Catholic Church the cover-ups inside the Catholic Church there's a story in Pennsylvania 300 priests were basically covered up for by the archdiocese in Pennsylvania a thousand kids who are abused minimum is really horrifying horrifying stuff but as I said on my podcast yesterday and a couple of days ago it is deeply important to recognize that institutions that deal with children routinely have problems with this and they routinely cover things up and that's not an excuse for the Catholic Church in any way but it is to suggest that singling out the Catholic Church as uniquely evil in this way is being intellectually dishonest hey can you can say that it's evil the treatment here is evil their treatment of the priest is evil the treatment of the kids evil you can say all of that because Catholics will agree with you right every you Catholic who saw this thing was sick to their stomach over the past week there's not a single Catholic in America or anywhere around the world who saw this story and saw how these priests were treated who didn't feel sick to their stomach and if you're a religious person of any stripe you should feel sick to your stomach that any religious institution would cover up for that but listen to what Trevor Noah has to say about it because this is a bridge further than that and this is why people in sort of mainstream America people who believe in God people who are religious feel that the media are coming after them hammer and tongs and are just waiting for an opportunity to stab us in the eye just in Pennsylvania like we're not even counting the rest of America and Europe and Africa and I'm sorry guys at some point I feel like we need to stop calling at a church and start calling it what it is I'm a less-than Club with an opening prayer because that's what it feels like that's an amazing statement right the Catholic Church is now molesting club with an opening prayer so question for Trevor Noah he works in Hollywood Hollywood not quite known for its shall we say sexual limits Hollywood where Roman Polanski wins an Oscar after raping a fourteen-year-old girl Hollywood where Woody Allen is still working Hollywood were Harvey Weinstein worked for years and years and years side by side with people like Trevor Noah how many people does Trevor Noah know who've actually abused people my guess is more than a few he may not know about the specific abuse but I promise you there are lots of people in Hollywood who do sexual abuse in Hollywood is rampant does he have you ever heard Trevor Noah say anything like Hollywood is molestation factory without an opening prayer have you ever heard anything like that of course not about the public schools when you ever hear anybody on the Left talk about sexual abuse inside the public schools there was an Associated Press report from May 2017 it found 17,000 official reports official reports of sex assaults on students from fall 2011 to spring 2015 it's amazing 17,000 official reports we were talking in Sylvania about 1000 reports over the course of 30 years here you're talking about in the public schools 17,000 official reports of sex assaults on students in four years alone according to Hofstra University researcher Cheryl Shake shaft who performs a study for the DIA the Department of Education in 2002 the physical sexual abuse of students in schools is likely more than 100 times the abuse by priests a federal report found four hundred and twenty-two thousand California public school students would be victimized by sexual abuse before graduation which was every time more than the entire California Catholic school enrollment it was a survey from the American Association of University Women it found that 1 in 10 students from 8th to 11th grade said they'd been subjected to sexual comments pornography peeping or sexual contact from a teacher or school employee which would mean four point five million students across America between kindergarten and 12th grade who suffered sexual abuse by an educator have you ever heard anybody on the Left talked about any of that stuff of course not even when the media reported it's relegated to secondary status which is one of the reasons why media will say yeah well we covered it right but did you cover it with the same sort of alacrity and anger that you cover abuse in the Catholic Church if the answer is no I have to assume the reason you are covering the Catholic Church differently then cover the sanctified public schools is because you like the public schools and you don't like the Catholic Church that is the rationale and it feels like every day there's a new assault from the left on fundamental values that the New York Times is constantly promoting a certain agenda with regard to key values that we all hold dear right key values like you know mothers and fathers I have to have to go through this there's a great editorial and when I'm great I mean it's just awful freakin garbage over the New York Times by a guy named Kevin Noble maelard he is a professor I believe at Syracuse University and he was working on a book about modern fatherhood in America which is always a bad sign his the title of his pieces when being a good dad gets you promoted to mommy okay and here's what he says he says I'm a sucker for dramatic homecomings I love stories of reunited siblings and I devour videos of dogs greeting returning soldiers but I participate in my own reunion spectacle every weekday when I pick up my three-year-old from preschool she charges at me like I'm an unattended bowl of cheddar goldfish mommy she squeals horseshoeing is the dude horseshoeing her tiny arms around my neck before she calls the emotion with the demand for food mommy you have snack my partner mama who is female is not there I like that we have to clarify all these things now not my wife my partner mama , who is female thanks for that he says when our daughter says mommy she's talking to me her father when my partner heard about this she left it's always weird to hear people who have a child together talk about their partners is that they formed in an LLC to have the kid since neither one of us corrected our daughter we assumed it was all part of language development then she went all in announcing that she has two mommies to the amusement of the lesbian parents at school yeah I have um used to because I'm a professor of family law so it's my job to analyze these types of occurrences as part of some larger issue well then we are paying you too much money my friend as in this case I'm intrigued by children's selection of names for their parents and what it possibly signifies you know it probably signifies that your kids a kid and it's kind of dumb okay breaking news as the father of kids two kids under five kids are stupid man I mean like I love them they're really smart for their age my daughter is brilliant for her age which means that she's four and a half and she takes a violin lesson and she can play like uh note and it means that she is on the verge of reading and it means that if she were twenty she'd be really stupid because when you're four-and-a-half and dumb right and so if my daughter is calling me Mommy or calling my wife daddy or something fair assumption that she hasn't come up with some grand sociological scheme to rejigger the definition of gender in American society most likely it's that she's dumb but no but no according to the New York Times this is an indicator of something deep and profound happening shifting within the nature of gender in the United States this guy says our other child to his five called both parents mama when he started talking maybe it's just that maybe if both your kids doing it now I'm starting to have suspicions our other child who's five called both parents mama when he started talking it must have meant old person because he once called our neighbor a six year old southern man mama again going back to my theory the kids are dumb at the time I was amused but slightly worried that this baby was bestowing maternity on anyone who held him I tried to steer him toward Papa but that was too much consonantal labor for this particular in from infants he settled on me me I was never threatened then this is the best part I was never thrilled about the actual name Dada which in American culture is someone who tells bad jokes and wears socks with sandals this part actually this is where we get into the culture gap when I think of my own father my father is a deeply devout human being a deeply responsible human by the way my mom worked my dad was at home because my mom was the breadwinner my mom went out and she worked all day and my dad was home raising us okay he was still my dad because you know the basic definition of dad honestly when you boil all the other things out the basic definition of dad is when it's time for an ass-whooping who do you call there is not a teenage boy on earth who's afraid of his mother it just doesn't work that way hey dad is the guy who is there to instill values and make sure those values are instilled dad is the guy who's makes sure they're to make sure that there is responsibility that is implemented in the children and mom is there for comfort now both parents have roles in both of those areas but those roles do have differentiation men have a more primary role when it comes to instilling virtue and ensuring that particularly boys are prepared for taking responsibility and making sure that girls feel protected and mom is there to make sure that everyone feels supported right that is the basic differentiation again my parents did some both but in my family where I take care of my I'm actually home with my kids more than my wife is at this point because as you may know my wife is a doc when someone skins their knee it's my wife's job to come in and fix that now be true even if she weren't a doctor and when it's time for the foot to come down then that's that's my job I want to talk a little bit more about this in just a second but first we're gonna have to go over and subscribe over at daily wire comm for those of you who are

greg gutfeld stopping by so check that out we're the largest fastest growing conservative podcast in the nation soda can to continue with this guy's idiotic piece over the New York Times and again going back to the theme the reason that we distrust the media is because they're constantly promulgating this sort of cultural change under the guise of journalism so this professor writes dad is is not a good guy right he's the lord of the grill and the Duke of fix-it he's the best of the good guys but when it comes to the nitty-gritty of parenting mom schedules the appointments buys the clothes and makes the playdates it is a common division of labor for most HEC heterosexual couples moms do more when I moved in with my partner we talked about gender norms I'll bet you did my friend said when I was younger I welcomed gender subversions in pop culture staples like Kramer vs Kramer mr. mom mrs. Doubtfire and even that pre Chuckie my buddy doll as an adult I'm still trying to do more and then he quotes in 1953 children's book called daddies and says what do daddies do all day daddies work while children play correct but this is very bad it's very bad right instead daddy is supposed to be mommy basically and so he's actually very pleased that he is called mommy he just hopes that one day there really won't be titles mommy and daddy instead it'll just be smoo I don't know what term we'll use for mommy and daddy that is by gender but apparently there's women says I presented the issue of my children's naming innovations to a fellow academic one who speaks fluent Berkeley which is to say that they were hit on the head as a child who told me that the Mimi mommy dialectic is a liminal space for interpolating and/or repudiating hegemony parental gender binaries at which point everybody ran is I thought about this mouthful of jargon for a long time I still think about it I like most modern men want to be taken seriously as a parent in my own right however my kids choose to name me I think of all the other fathers the single ones the stay-at-home ones the gay ones even the dad ones who do more than earn paychecks and babysit we are knocking at the door for an interview at the toughest job in the world waiting to be let in the idea that if you want to take care of your kids more hours per day that this makes you mommy is just a way to obliterate gender distinctions it's just a way to pretend that men and women are exactly the same and they play exactly the same role that's foolish it's not the amount of time you spend with your kids that makes you a mommy or a daddy it's how you interact with your kids it is indeed the quality of that interaction and the attitude that you take during that interaction it's there's a great video on YouTube sort of contrasting how moms and dads deal with small children and it shows a mother with her kid on like a little tricycle and she's trying to make sure the kid doesn't fall off the tricycle it's all really cute and they're moving really slowly and they have to make sure that the kid doesn't pull over and then the dad comes in and that grabs the tricycle and starts swinging it around the room men and women are different one of the most beautiful things in life the fact that the left wants to obliterate those distinctions the fact the left wants to destroy all that is really truly troubling in a serious way and the reason why we don't trust people on the left to promulgate this this sort of nonsense okay now meanwhile it's not just people on the left in media tell us what people on left in social media so over at Twitter they have decided they are now going to limit what you can see Jack Dorsey did an interview this week he's the head of Twitter in which he suggested that it was his job to guide people toward healthier conversation here's what he had to say we want to take a broader view in terms of what our service can provide and that ability to show some of the darkest places in the world shine light on them and try to disarm it and try to engage it in a way that gets us to a healthier public conversation where we can all participate and we can all debate and we don't fear our safety and we feel protected that is our goal we are not here to have Jack Dorsey tell us what a healthy conversation constitutes or have him pick for us what we can and cannot see on Twitter the same people the same people at the New York Times who promulgate the worst kinds of ideas are the same people who are going to social media and saying should elevate us as fact tellers and you should downgrade everybody we disagree with this is dangerous stuff and it's why so many people are kicking back against what actually has become a hegemonic news media attempting to cramp the diversity of viewpoints that really should be exploding in the media ecosystem and meanwhile I have to tell you that there's a there's an awful awful story I want to tell you about because it says something about human nature to shift topics for a few minutes there's this story from the New York Times by a person named real Kamini kalamaki and it's a story of these two people and their names are Jay Austin and Lauren Geoghan I think is how it's pronounced here's what happened they were remember that they're American citizens and they decided to go on a bike trip around the world and they decided to go into areas that are not particularly safe one of the areas of the bike trip they went on was an area in Tajikistan which is right on the Afghan border and it turns out that when they did some Isis members is the first Isis attack in the country I believe some Isis members basically ran them off the road with the truck and then stabbed them to death the reason that this story is so horrifying is because what it says about people's view of evil and human nature and so here's what the New York Times suggests the New York Times says asked why they put their office jobs and set off on a biking journey around the world the young American couple offered a simple explanation they'd grown tired of the meetings and teleconferences of the time sheets and password changes there's magic out there in this great big beautiful world wrote Jay Austin who along with his partner Lauren Geoghan gave his two weeks notice last year before shipping his bicycle to Africa and they went you know for more than a year they just went biking around everywhere and there on July 29th in in Tajikistan a carload of men who are believed to have recorded a video pledging allegiance to Isis spotted them a grainy cell phone clip recorded by a driver shows what happened next the men's dive was sedan passes the cyclists and then makes a sharp u-turn it doubles back aims directly for the bikers ramming into them and lurching over their fallen forms and all four people were killed mr. Austin miss Geoghan and cyclists from Switzerland and Netherlands and then Isis released a video in which they made a pledge to kill disbelievers the reason that this story is is worth talking about because of the worldview of the people who went biking it's obviously the it's a tragic terrible terrible story but the reason that these folks decided they were going to do this is because what they said is that evil is a human construct here's what mr. Austen wrote before he was killed here well you read the papers and you're led to believe that the world is a big scary place people the narrative goes are not to be trusted people are bad people are evil I don't buy it evil is a make-believe concept we've invented to deal with the complexities of fellow humans holding values and beliefs and perspectives different than our own by and large humans are kind self-interested sometimes myopic sometimes but kind generous and wonderful and kind no greater revelation has come from our journey than this and then of course they were murdered by Isis it's it's I mean terrible story but this view is very very common among folks who tend to be on the left side of the political aisle it even includes some folks who are libertarian ish in the sense that they believe that there don't necessarily need to be social systems that inculcate virtue in children that people aren't by necessity self-interested in the self-interest is good and therefore you can lead people to their own devices I generally grant governmental grounds and do not agree that it is not our job to instill virtue or that people are by nature good I don't think people are by nature good I think people are by nature capable of both good and capable of evil now what he says here is kind of interesting when he says evils and make-believe concepts we've invented to deal with complexities of fellow humans holding values and beliefs and perspectives different than our own this suggests that there is no such thing as an evil value system which of course is not true there are plenty of evil value systems and failure to adjudicate between value systems failure to say certain value systems are worse than other value systems allows those value systems to thrive to rise and to eventually take over because one of the great lies that we're told when we're children is that good is more powerful than evil good is not more powerful than evil good can only triumph when there are lots of good people and a lot fewer evil people evil is a lot more powerful than good and this is proof right the story is proof of that because these folks went on this bicycle journey all over the world ninety nine out of every hundred people they met nice people all over the world all it takes is one person who wants to stab you in the face for their religion and it turns out that evil wins which is why we have to be constantly vigilant for evil it's why we have to build systems to contain evil and check evil it's why we have to have a power military to fight evil it's why we have to constantly be looking at value systems in determining whether those value systems are more likely to create evil action if we're not actually doing that then we're not doing our jobs as moral human beings I believe and it creates a naive generation of people who have lived under the protection of the most powerful military in human history who've lived under the protection of the West but believe that the natural state of human beings is to be like this that is not true the natural state of human beings is poverty war and death Hobbes is right about that okay that's the natural state of human beings it is only a civilized system a civilized worldview a government that is limited in scope that allows us to live free and allows us to bring up our children in such a way that they don't become evil but instead become good good value driven human beings that make the world a better place all righty so now it's time for some things I like and then some things I hate so things I like very sad news that a recent Aretha Franklin passed today that obviously everybody is very upset about and you'll remember her great performance in Blues Brothers she really had an unbelievable gift her voice is just spectacular this is some of the best Aretha Franklin ever from from Blues Brothers have you never seen the movie by the way it's a very funny movie it's and Aretha Franklin it's worthwhile modem kind of her place in the culture Aretha Franklin came about at a time when there was no such thing really as a black solo female artist in in the pop genre there were some jazz artists but but not in in sort of this area gospel was not a mainstream form yet and she kind of brought it over into into the mainstream and of course you can tell her talent because honestly like there are a lot of women like Diana Ross a very good-looking woman Aretha Franklin was a normal-looking person who just had an unbelievable gift and so you know obviously it very sad for her to pass and her music is gonna live on beyond her other things that I like so Glenn Close ready to Hollywood actress actually said something halfway intelligent today it was great she was talking about this it II just idiotic new movement by the left that says that you can only play a character if you are like that character in real life so you can only print play a transgender person if you are a transgender person you can only play a gay person if you are a gay person you can only play Superman if you can fly you can only play a space alien if in fact you descend from Thanos right you can't that's how all this is gonna work well Glenn Close who is still she can get away with this because she's a major actress has been in town for four decades she says um I thought we were actors I thought that was like our thing say here's what she had to say people who are producing and directing properties like that need to go out of their way to give people like you know if you're playing trance and get trans actors jobs but they also should have the opportunity to cast the best person I think acting is a craft you know I think I personally think on that anyone should be able to play anyone well it's gonna be very sad when her career ends because that you're not allowed to say these sorts of things in Hollywood anymore and proof of this is in the things that I hate there's one of the stars of Queer Eye for the straight guy I came out and said that not all Republicans are racist I know it's a revelation but this person was destroyed for it so here is what this this fellow had to say about Republicans I'm not advocating for racism I'm definitely not advocating for Donald Trump who sucks but I am saying that from the left if you want to get us into a safer place nationally so that we can have LGBT rights and we can continue having equality then we have to be able to not demonize the right you got shellacked for this right that's exactly right this guy's exactly right he doesn't think like anybody in this room does probably but that's great that he actually is willing to recognize that his career will be over this is the thing you cannot say on the left well the left claims they want to reach out to all of us they don't actually want to reach out to all of us they prefer to call everybody on this side of the aisle a Nazi and a racist and a terrible person and then castigate us for our immorality it makes it very comfortable for them to push crappy policy you never have to justify your policy if the guy on the other side is a Nazi but this but this person says something good it's just sad to me that this person was attacked for all of it okay other things that I hate so yesterday you will recall that Andrew Cuomo said that America was never that great yeah and Andrew Cuomo who is indeed the stupider Cuomo brother as he proved this week a difficult title to seize from his brother Crispin well Cynthia Nixon responded it was really funny cuz Cynthia Nixon is running against him for governor of New York and Cynthia Nixon responded by saying that he's a fake he's a phony he talks like he thinks socialists talk so now she gets to outflank him by saying like he's not anti-american enough hey she's gradually dragging Andrew Cuomo along with her just like the socialist wing of the Democratic Party is dragging the entire Democratic Party along with them hand over hand by rope it's pretty amazing and you can see it even in our best friend Hillary Clinton who is back she's back okay so there's a there's a video that was going around the internet of this little 11 year old girl who was kneeling for the pledge of allegiance now if at 11 years old you're kneeling for the pledge of allegiance it's fair to say that you've probably been indoctrinated by your parents in certain political viewpoints here's what this little girl did and there's a news story about it and then we'll show you what Hillary had to say about it I decided to kneel for the school pledge and what I did so my teacher she um she came up to me and she told me that um what she basically implied I was disrespecting the country she brought up her family overseas which to my current beliefs is that she like legally this is not okay so I feel bad for this girl I honestly I feel bad for the girl because her parents put her in the position of doing this in front of her teacher and classmates it is true that under Supreme Court law she does not have to actually stand for the Pledge of Allegiance or anything like that right they think that's compelled speech you can't do that in a classroom however it is also true that it is bad for eleven-year-old girls to be taught that they should not stand for the Pledge of Allegiance which is a unifying feature of the United States and simply recognizes that we live in the greatest country ever found it so how far has the Democratic Party moved here was Hillary Clinton's response on Twitter she tweeted this out it takes courage to exercise your right to protest injustice especially when you're 11 keep up the good work Mariana okay I can't imagine how in the world this woman lost the presidency to Donald Trump how how could that possibly have happened the fact that the fact that the Democrats are so deeply uncomfortable with basic patriotism is one of the reasons why the Democrats are losing the middle of the country it's also one of the reasons why the country is being torn apart it's torn in half because once the American flag becomes something that is controversial what exactly do we share anymore we don't share religion we don't share central values we don't share a belief in the Constitution we don't believe I share a belief in God given rights protected by limited government we don't believe in any of these things if the basic symbolism of we at least like the country goes away there's not much left so it's it's it's really disturbing that Hillary's doing this now I promised one of our producers Colton Holden is Quentin's job on the show is to find weird stuff and Colton spends a lot of time on the internet finding weird stuff he says it's for the show I assume that I assume that he's telling the truth and he showed me this very very weird thing that I felt I felt compelled to talk about there are now people who dress adults who dress as babies as a fetish it's an actual thing and there's video of these people and this exists on this planet on planet earth and I hesitate to inflict this on you but I'm just that cruel so here is a in a video about this demonstrating you know what some of the I would say more fringe elements well what less understood elements put less understood elements of our population go through in pursuing their jollies an adult baby is somebody who enjoys dressing up and acting like a baby well I've got my diaper changing materials nice and close I've got my puppy dog mobile when I have to make a number two it's in the toilet and no I don't sit in a wet diaper all day long and of course I've got mine on some of my favorite adult baby activities would be playing with my my DUPLO Legos you can build anything or you can imagine Colton you're fired the reason to talk about this is because when we say that we may be infantilizing our adults when we may be saying that may that if we look at that we go yeah that seems strange maybe we shouldn't all be like super cool with that sort of thing then that's considered intolerant it is intolerant because how first of all I have a question how do we know that that isn't actually a baby he identifies as a baby how do we know that that is not in fact a small child in a giant man's body I mean I feel like we are being absolutely adult nor we're being age normative and that is just wrong we should totally not mock this in any way whatsoever when when tolerance gets to the point where men dressing in diapers and lying in cribs is considered part of a media coverage that ought to be you know given that sort of credit I think maybe the country has gone wrong maybe we've brought up our kids a little bit wrong so to go back to the main theme of the show until people start recognizing that there are some certain basic values that we may want to inculcate in our kids there ended up like that then we then we're going to have some real problems in the country okay well we will see you back here next time i'm ben shapiro this is the ben shapiro show the basic eurozone is produced by Sonia Villarreal executive producer Jeremy Borah senior producer Jonathan hey our supervising
