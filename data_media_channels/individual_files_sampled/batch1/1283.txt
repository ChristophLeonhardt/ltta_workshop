the gap between wish and poise getting wider most of the world's wealth generated last year ended up in the pockets of already of beverage people while billions are struggling simply to survive why can't the world be more it world this is inside story hello and welcome to the program I'm Hoshi mahabhava the rich are getting richer and the poor poorer Oxfam's latest report on inequality paints a stark picture of a widening gap between the world's haves and the have-nots 82% of global wealth generated last year went to the richest 1% of the population for the 3.7 billion people who make up the poorest half of the world there was an no increase in wealth Oxfam pins much of the blame on the erosion of workers rights and big business having too much influence over government policymaking in an attempt to balance the scales the charity is calling for a minimum wage people can live on higher taxes on the rate and more spending on public services like health and education according to Oxfam's data 42 billionaires control as much wealth as the poorest half of the world's population as of early January Amazon boss Jeff Bezos is the world's richest man with a fortune topping a hundred billion dollars only one out of ten of the world's billionaires are women L'Oreal heiress liliane bettencourt was worth nearly 40 billion dollars when she died last year and most billionaires are from Asia with China leading the pack its booming economy can produce two new billionaires every week let's bring in our panel joining us from London Vicki price an economist at the Centre for economics and business research from Rabat Latin Haddad a Moroccan MP and professor at mohamed v university also in london philippe LeGrande an economist and author of European Spring why our economies and politics are in a mess and how to put them right welcome to you all let me start by asking miss price this why has income inequality worsened over the last decade or so well the truth is that income inequality if you're looking it across the world has not worsened in the sense that many people have come out of the poverty line hundreds of million of in China for example but also India are now earning course every more than that did before but what has been happening while this growth has been going on in a number of countries that are now sort of developing in a very reasonable way what has been going on is that in fact the distribution of wealth has not held up in any sensible way so what we found is that you know looking at the data but Oxford has done that particularly well in that report it is that a lot of the wealth has been concentrated in in too few hands in the developing world it's been going on of course in the developed for some time but the developing world is suffering significantly from the fact that the money has not been distributed fairly across and and people often earn very low wages which are hardly able to support them mr. Haddad is it because of the way business is conducted in the modern time is it because of globalization is there any particular reason why we're having this gap well I think that there is this gap because there is a sense I mean like a lot of leeway that has been given to a lot of rich people in this sense that there are tax breaks there are also a lot of incentives when the capital moves from the global north to the global south there is also a lot of I mean there is the theory actually that has been going on for a lot of for for so many decades now there was what is good for the rich is also good for the poor in the sense that the more wealth you create on the upper level then a lot of it will go or some of it will go down to the others in terms of job creation in terms of business opportunities but what is happening is like there is there is some sort of growth in the wealth worldwide and some of the poor are less poor in some of the countries but the problem is like the share between those who are rich and those who are poor is widening in the sense that there are more people up on the upper level making more money than those who are actually like on the of the poorest kind of levels so I think that is yes it's globalization it's also theories that exist within about how to do business and what is the best way of actually achieving economic development mr. Legrand there is a tangle here between the wealth inequality and income inequality if you look at the global a wealth generated a 67 percent is in Europe and United States of America two percent in Africa so is there any element of instability war conflicts that is very conducive to this situation or do you think more is something intrinsic to the capitalistic system on its own I think its first of all it's important to point out that yes there are very big disparities in global wealth and in global income and it's important that we try to reduce them at the same time it's misleading to suggest that only a few billionaires are benefiting from the global economic system and the poorest half of the population are not the share of the world population living in extreme poverty has fallen from 35 percent in 1990 to 10 percent you look at real wages in China of the past decade they've trebled and the garment workers who the Oxford Oxford points who in their report in Vietnam and in Bangladesh are actually doing much better typically than most people in those economies and so I think it's quite wrong to suggest that somehow it's only benefiting the very wealthiest at the same time there clearly is a big problem and I think partly it's due to globalization in the sense that before those who are successful were successful at a local level now they can be successful at a global level the market is much bigger and therefore the rewards of the one of the most successful are larger second of all the explosion of the financial sector and all the wealth that has been taken by the participants and they're not necessarily the investors in the financial sector and then thirdly you've seen I think increased monopoly power of some companies and them using that monopoly power to reward they're CEOs in an excessive way mm-hmm mr. price I mean even before Oxfam issued the report this is something that has galvanized attention for quite some time if you remember a French economist Thomas Piketty said in his book that as long as the rate returning capital is bigger than the growth you will continue to have the same problem basically which is a tiny minority ended up with loads of cash and billions of people suffering well I'm afraid that's probably the case but I think it's worth looking at what is going on in a number of economies the reality is that a lot of the money has not been used for public spending more generally to improve infrastructure health education for people particularly for women in a number of areas the oxford report highlights that so it's not just the case of perhaps wealth being concentrated in a few hands because of capitalism and so on the way that it's been developed that Thomas Piketty has spoken about it is also that policies within individual countries have just not done the right thing and that's where the focus needs to be of course we need to do something about having greater access to the money and everyone in fact paying a fair tax but you need a real restructuring of the way in which government is run and also the way in which companies are operating those countries themselves are treating their own workers corporate social responsibility was something everyone was talking about and it recently seems to be slightly forgotten but some of the recommendations in the Oxfam report are that this should be huge amount of spending done by the public sector that one should watch what happens and what you subcontract to the private sector thinks that we also see of course in the developed world being an issue but and but more generally does require an awful lot of money to be directed the right way so technical support but also frowning upon the way in which some of the the leaders of various countries operate more controls of what happens to the money that should be legitimately staying in the country a lot of corruption is there that is not so we're talking about an organizational Ostrom can necessarily solve overnight talking about it has been the national corporation basically a new rule yeah I see mr. Haddad now you on the other hand you have conservative economists saying that the only way out of this inequality is basically tax cuts and government delegation instead of imposing taxes on wealth well III don't I don't think so I think that there needs to be some sort of business environments where people can invest so some sorts of tax incentives are good but I think reducing really like the corporate tax and also the income tax so much and then don't not having for example taxes on capital gains or on dividends is not the way to go and and as the Oxfam kind of report showed if there is only 1.5 like percent taxes on the billionaires that will probably like deal with the education problem that exists in in in in developing countries so so I think that there needs to be like a fair system of taxation in the sense that it's not a lot of pressure on the business but at the same time I mean I think we need to generate a lot of a lot of income and resources you know when there are for example like pressures from international organization a lot of the African countries but also South Asian countries and Latin American countries in order to balance the budgets also to have like some sorts of macroeconomic sound and that's what really like gets kind of sacrificed are the spending on education and spending on health and all of that and I think those kinds of you cannot have that you cannot have like reduction in terms of spending and at the same time I mean have reductions in taxes I think that's something that is probably like mathematically impossible therefore I think some sorts of tax system which does not give tax breaks for the rich and a lot of the rich although they may get like tax breaks I mean some of that money is not reinvested in the economy as the Conservatives theorists like Stella grant how can we juggle the need to implement those reforms and at the same time take into account a new changing dynamic in the world technology for example has been taken away jobs from the middle middle class how can you address this situation where the world is moving faster words in your territory you're absolutely right to say that technology has been taking away some jobs it's also been creating new ones the road to success is to try and accelerate the benefits that we get from technology while ensuring those benefits are widely shared and while equipping workers with the skills to acquire the new jobs that are being created and indeed to continue changing jobs over time I think looking at the poorest half who are the focus of the oboz population who are the focus of the Oxfam report I think there's lots that can be done at a national level in terms of raising minimum wages and ensuring that labor regulations are properly enforced there's lots that could be done in terms of ensuring that taxes are raised more efficiently that they actually are progressive very often in developing countries they hit the poor hardest and the rich not at all that they focus on wealth and not just on incomes and in particular on wealth that can't move so for example property which is easier to tax than more flighty forms of wealth and that there must there be a government that genuinely works to improve the living conditions of everyone not a government that is captured by cronies of of the ruling class and cosseted businesses so you know the model is a development of countries such as South Korea which invested very quickly in education for all in infrastructure and ensuring a competition among firms not oligopolies that exploit the population miss price I mean the moment you talk about how to move forward then you have two options people would tell you countries that provide more equal distribution of income like Scandinavia for example could be a role model at the same time you get the same reaction from people in the u.s. telling you that's class warfare we should not allow for any system that one to prevail I mean how can we balance the two approaches one which is in favor for more private sector to be aggressive and one which says no we need to have the public and the private sector come together to solve this issue I think the public sector and the private sector have to work together there is no doubt about that but if you compare countries which have a quantum of equality where the state sector works it's quite large and works quite well perhaps with the private sector and you look at others where this isn't the case and you have a more unequal Society there isn't any direct link that tells you that one grows less fast and the other certainly if you look at the short to medium term but if you keep those inequalities going for a long period of time what you get is a huge disruption and dissatisfaction in the country and therefore you get fewer people wanting to invest and lower growth so there are long term negative impacts of having that inequality remain and what is more you then get people moving out of the country perhaps particularly those who can afford to go elsewhere and that you you rob the the talent from the countries you leave them behind with less productivity and less growth but also then you accentuate the problem for the rest because of huge migration flows that we are seeing right now so I'm afraid what needs to happen is that sort of two prong thing first of all to see whether there is some money that can be transferred either by taxing perhaps some other very wealthy but also the Western countries paying more into the developing world and they've done so far so it's not just relief and and and support for famines and so on but actual proper economic development money going in but working very closely with the government so that would be the the first way of doing it and the other thing is to possibly think of the types of sanctions that that can can be used against countries that don't follow that principle because in in reality you know if they can carry on trading just as I did before despite the fact population is suffering actually in relation to just a few people in the center or at the top then you you don't actually get anywhere so there has to be a system that is working across in terms of trade rules for taxation whether we accept any Goods for people or even oil from countries which actually don't do the right thing so it is it is something that does this I said earlier require quite a lot of working across but with international organizations which are very important like the IMF the World Bank which are there as well and working quite closely with speak of a system that works through mr. Haddad in Morocco a country that faces financial constraints basically there's been always this debate about the need to impose higher minimum wage greater access to education for to shrink the wealth gap is this something that is feasible I let me just speak to the question of International Development I think what is happening right now if you look at the International Development scene there about like 14 billion dollars that is spent by rich countries on poor countries but at the same time with a lot of the investments and globalization and a lot of the big kind of businesses in the global South they reap out something like 6 trillion dollars in terms of tax breaks in terms of profits in terms also of cheap labor and all of that so it's a very in equal kind of situation in terms of International Development I mean I think it can work but I mean not really like that that was so I think what what needs to happen is to have like a fair kind of system financial system which now like profits more I mean like the global North it's it's it's very advantageous to a lot of the businesses but also took a lot of the wealthy people in the global but I mean like talking about what needs to be done I think one of the things that that needs to be done is actually cash conditional cash transfers to the poor that's something that needs to be done it needs to be conditional but it needs also to be I compile it but some sort of skill training for a lot of the poor and I think it has works in a lot of countries the other thing is like a lot of people have moved from poverty and then they are now in the middle class but they are very vulnerable because they are close to poverty they can fall back any kind of time so strengthening those through education through incentives through different kinds of supports so that they can stay in the middle class but also have the right skills in order to function is something that needs to be done but I mean like for a lot of countries including Morocco but also in the global South generally what needs to happen is to move away from the clientelist kind of system where there are revolving doors between the businesses and the political elite that's one of the problems a lot of the business people are also part of the political elite a lot of the politicians become businessmen and there are all kinds of like pass throughs that happen and this is and I think it needs to be an oversight and also very very good system of transparency and accountability over sides and this particular angle mr. Haddad this is going to be my question to mr. Legrand I mean we're talking about the need to reform the financial system and it's owned by the same time people are saying that what needs to be done first of all is to ensure that the one-percent elite that accumulates wealth stops using the political establishment to further advance its own economic agenda how can you how can you implement it yes well I mean I think financial reform has to be right at the top of the global agenda you know it's amazing we've had the worst financial crisis since the 1930s and there's been a bit of tinkering around the edges but basically the system is intact and now with the election of President Trump there's talking of the United States going backwards on some of the regulations have been put into place and I think there's a very big difference between the global businesses which are being attacked often in this Oxfam report which perhaps could behave better but at the same time are creating products that people genuinely want and employing people doing valuable things and a financial sector which sometimes does productive things like helping to finance companies but on the other hand often does engages in destabilizing speculation blows up bubbles causes crises and enriches the participants in that system and not necessarily the investors and then when things go wrong use their links to governments to get bailed out and you know I think that's the deep cause of the or troubles that we're seeing in Europe and in North America the sense of injustice is completely understandable and right and very very little has been done of it and I think if there has to be a focus are for reform really cutting the financial sector down to size ensuring it serves the needs of the real economy rather than its own and ensuring that when things go wrong the people in the financial sector bear the losses rather than being inflated on society as a whole has to be an absolutely top priority mr. price I mean in this particular part of the world we're talking about an area beset by wars conflicts instability massive destruction you talk about the need for hundreds of billions of dollars in the near future to be able to address the situation is this something which is the instability that is marring the region that it was as the situation he asked for this gap that we're talking about I'm afraid so so conflicts don't help at all and of course they create quite a lot of uncertainty but of course we've seen the humanitarian costs that are there rebuilding it afterwards takes a long time and it has already done terrible things to the fabric of society so getting back to something more sensible takes time so any way that one can avoid those conflicts to begin with and it's easier said than done of course but also being absolutely prepared to help with the reconstruction afterwards is also significant to allow therefore the cooperation between businesses and and government to come back so that there is some certainty when companies invest and I understand exactly what what we've just been talking about which is the financial sector sometimes not being very helpful but we do need the funding there is just no doubt about it that somehow or other one requires big transfers of funds maybe marshal farmers about that like we had after the yea marshall plan of sorts so the size of the Marshall Plan funds which we needed in Europe we actually need an awful lot in very places in the developing world particularly in areas of conflict and this migration that I mentioned earlier needs to be tackled that way too but I think just one short point about corruption I think that is something quite significant when Oxfam talks about taxing the money and and making sure I guess this is it we often don't actually know where that money is I'm afraid I'll just have to get one last questions mr. Lester had that in less than a minute please when you see the leader of the United States of America saying that there's absolutely no way we can give money to the rest of the world unless they are on board or with us are you concerned that the idea of cooperation and the rich helping the poor might come to an end why I think he's also like a question of leadership and I think the country like the United States should go on leading in terms of international development but also in in support in all the kinds of UN agencies but other also I mean other actors on the ground that are doing like fabulous work in terms of poverty reductions I think it's not it's it's in the interests of the United States was also its interests of the leadership but I mean should that happen I think there are other kinds of players that will come in I mean like China is ready to move in as as the Langer I mean it has the money it has also the power to do that first you also go can I just go very very basic question of the Middle East it I mean like Dean yeah very briefly the inequality and injustice is also one of the factors that led to the revolutions whether it in so many of those kinds of can thank you so the inequality it leads to revolution most of the revolutions actually don't don't don't create equality we're running out of time lesson had that Vicki price and Philip Legrand thank you very much indeed for your time your contribution to the program and thank you too for watching you can see that program again anytime by visiting our website aljazeera.com for further discussion go to our Facebook page that's facebook.com forward slash AJ inside story you can also join the conversation on twitter our handle is at aj inside story from me Hashim the whole team here bye for now you
