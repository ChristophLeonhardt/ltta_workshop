there was a student at a Texas High School who posted a video to Twitter of the schools dress code skit that they made she claimed today my school was shown this video so sad how only girls are shown as the violators I understand why my school has a dress code but what about the boys who wear shorts or show their shoulders it's 2018 why are we still over sexualizing teen girls check out the video okay follow me so what are you in here for I'm wearing a she then went on to claim stuff about inclusiveness and gender and non-binary and race and you know all of that whole rhetoric blah blah blah and everyone is just supporting her on Twitter I don't get it yes these young girls have a different dress code to the boys sure maybe they can try and get a boys version of this dress code video made but they're going beyond saying hey what about the guys they're acting like we should wear whatever we want why are you judging us and sexualizing us i watch the video and the girls were not dressed appropriately not only were they wearing really short shorts but it looked like they were dressed to go to bed look at those baggy shirts what is that that is not what a decent adult goes out of the house and goes to class in is just disrespectful to the teachers and the institution of learning why have we gone this far is there no self-respect no accountability no respect for others and learning I'm a firm believer in dressing appropriately it's perfectly acceptable to teach young girls to be women this is why we need to bring back finishing school and etiquette if you want to see more from me and the rest of the rebel team like and subscribe you
