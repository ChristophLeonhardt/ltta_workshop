Armed rangers guard Sudan, the worldâ€™s last
male northern white rhino.
Poachers have nearly wiped out the species,
killing 1,215 rhinos in 2014.
In Asia, many believe rhino horn can cure
certain illnesses, like cancer.
Rhino horns are said to be worth more than
gold; a single horn can cost over $100,000
on the black market.
As of 2013, only 29,000 rhinos remain in the
wild.
Wildlife experts hope to use artificial methods
of reproduction to save the northern white
rhino from extinction.
