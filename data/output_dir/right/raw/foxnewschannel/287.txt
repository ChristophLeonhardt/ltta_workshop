EQUIVALENT OF DONALD TRUMP AND

80
00:03:12,710 --> 00:03:13,810
FIGHT BACK LIKE HE DOES OR

81
00:03:13,811 --> 00:03:17,981
SHOULD THEY STAND FOR SOMETHING

82
00:03:17,982 --> 00:03:19,682
AS MICHELLE OBAMA WOULD SAY,

83
00:03:19,683 --> 00:03:20,617
HIGHER?

84
00:03:20,618 --> 00:03:22,118
THEY DON'T KNOW WHICH DIRECTION

85
00:03:22,119 --> 00:03:23,019

86
00:03:23,020 --> 00:03:29,292
ESPECIALLY IN THE ACTIVIST BASE.

87
00:03:29,293 --> 00:03:35,899

88
00:03:35,900 --> 00:03:40,336
BE AN EVEN TOUGHER DEBATE.

89
00:03:40,337 --> 00:03:45,275

00:03:46,677 --> 00:03:48,211
NIGHT FOR WEEKS FROM NOW.

92
00:03:48,212 --> 00:03:50,213
THIS IS NOT A GENIE THAT GETS

93
00:03:50,214 --> 00:03:52,816
EASILY PUT BACK IN THE BOTTLE,

94
00:03:52,817 --> 00:03:56,019
IT IS THE EERIE FEELING OF THE

95
00:03:56,020 --> 00:03:57,020
1960s OR 1970s RADICALISM.

96
00:03:57,021 --> 00:03:59,589
WE ARE JUST GETTING IT TO THE

98
00:04:00,491 --> 00:04:04,961

99
00:04:04,962 --> 00:04:05,395

104
00:04:12,236 --> 00:04:14,437
INTERESTING FOR ONE REASON OR

105
00:04:14,438 --> 00:04:14,771
ANOTHER.

106
00:04:14,772 --> 00:04:17,640
>> I LOOKED AT THE ARIZONA RACE

107
00:04:17,641 --> 00:04:19,209
BECAUSE SUDDENLY, IT'S MORE

108
00:04:19,209 --> 00:04:20,809
PERSONAL TO ME.

109
00:04:20,810 --> 00:04:23,613

112
00:04:25,749 --> 00:04:26,149
>> YES.

113
00:04:26,150 --> 00:04:28,084
THE NEWS THAT CAME OUT TODAY WAS

114
00:04:28,085 --> 00:04:29,686
THAT SHE HOSTED LYNN STEWART WHO

115
00:04:29,687 --> 00:04:33,990

120
00:04:39,563 --> 00:04:41,598
TURNS OUT THAT LYNN WAS LATER ON

O'ROURKE GETS CROWDS OF LIKE

136
00:05:12,663 --> 00:05:14,264
50,000 AND NOBODY THAT I'VE

00:05:14,265 --> 00:05:15,431
TALKED TO ACTUALLY THINKS THAT

138
00:05:15,432 --> 00:05:16,733
HE'S GOING TO WIN IT, BUT THE

139
00:05:16,734 --> 00:05:18,935

00:05:18,936 --> 00:05:20,803
THE FIELDS OR FERTILIZING THE

141
00:05:20,804 --> 00:05:22,772

144
00:05:26,010 --> 00:05:26,409
PURPLE.

145
00:05:26,410 --> 00:05:27,176
THEY'VE BEEN DISAPPOINTED IN THE

146
00:05:27,177 --> 00:05:29,078
PAST BUT THIS TIME THEY THINK

147
00:05:29,079 --> 00:05:30,246
THEY WILL MAKE INROADS.

148
00:05:30,247 --> 00:05:31,915
>> I PICKED THE MONTANA SENATE

149
00:05:31,916 --> 00:05:35,518
RACE, THE INCUMBENT IS THE

150
00:05:35,519 --> 00:05:39,155
SENATE, AND I THINK IT'S THE

151
00:05:39,156 --> 00:05:41,991
BEST CHANCE FOR A REPUBLICAN

152
00:05:41,992 --> 00:05:44,394
PICKUP THAT IS NOT GETTING VERY

153
00:05:44,395 --> 00:05:44,861
MUCH ATTENTION.

154
00:05:44,862 --> 00:05:46,162
THE POLLS ARE VERY, VERY CLOSE

155
00:05:46,163 --> 00:05:49,732
AND REPUBLICANS ARE WAITING FOR

156
00:05:49,733 --> 00:05:50,600
ASP 15 EFFECT.

157
00:05:50,601 --> 00:05:55,638
WE BELIEVE IT WILL TAKE PLACE

158
00:05:55,639 --> 00:05:59,409
AND EARLY VOTING STARTS NEXT

159
00:05:59,410 --> 00:05:59,876
WEEK IN MONTANA.

160
00:05:59,877 --> 00:06:03,413
SO IF THERE IS ANOTHER CAVANAUGH

161
00:06:03,414 --> 00:00:00,000
EFFECT AND WHEN IT'S STRONGEST,
