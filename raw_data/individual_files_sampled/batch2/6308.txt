Lindsay Joel writes in Schenck jr. oh because Ciara reads the tweets from time to time I just completed my first mission as part of the TYT army I'm proud to be progressive hashtag too strong hashtag DUI t army hash tighty-whitey live so you might be wondering wait a minute what's going on here are we sending people out on missions okay so yes today the TYT army launched now i told you that there are secret missions we did one of those secret missions today and it was to correct the record on something that was being said about alexandria Acacio cortez and our victory so we didn't know how many people would sign up when we asked for people people to join the army and and to go on these missions and do it through social media and the media and affect the conversation because it's time to progressives fought back and it within the first couple of hours three hundred and twenty-one people had signed up and then four hundred and sixty-seven and then five hundred and twenty-one and then I lost track so that army was launched today when we have results we will get them to you and and by the way I'm gonna want to feature some of you guys so so so some of you guys who did the best work on it and got results can't wait to give you credit now speaking of which there's so many good news today from the progressive worlds Wolf Pack had a giant victory yesterday I mean you wonder about armies now we got a couple of different armies and going in in different directions but all headed towards progress so wolf pack wants to get money out of politics there's a state senator who killed the legislation when it had already passed one of the houses in Maryland and was set to passed the Senate but he couldn't get out of committee because she decided not to vote for it because some Democratic lobbyists whispered in her ear so Wolfpack decided sorry but you gotta go it's not personal but if you're gonna vote to keep money in politics you're gone now she's an incumbent and she's been incumbent for a long time so she's not that easy right so but there was Antonio Hayes who was running against her and Wolfpack gave him he don't give it to him it's a it's does an independent expenditure not coordinated but they spent $50,000 on that race you know how much difference $40,000 makes in a local race a lot okay and so did we were we able to defeat the incoming only with a stick and Tonio Hayes our candidate won by 30 points so check yourself before you wreck yourself next time you decide to vote against Wolfpack careful what you wish for did you tell anyone to hold his beer it's like oh you're gonna vote for money in politics hold my beer that makes no sense that be the work that you're doing your words okay anyway so by the way if you want to participate of Matt I let me give you both wolf dash pack.com slash stick that is specifically for Wolf Pack to raise money for consequences okay those are political sticks and they work so the person who voted against us gone in retirement okay now if you want to be part of the TYT arm etui t.com slash army okay and be part of those legendary forces that are now unleashed upon the internet we are going to be polite and civil and that's real okay but we are going to correct people where they are wrong where the trolls come with misinformation and lies we come with truth and facts okay now one more piece of great news Alexandra at Casa Cortez has a lot of you know last night did a stunning upset of Joe Crowley the number four Democrat in the House it was even Michael Schur last night said no in all of his years of covering politics probably among the top four biggest upsets in American congressional modern history in our lifetimes so it's amazing and she's a justice Democrat she was in the first batch of just Democrats so now I love this the press is now growing around going oh my god we missed it we missed it well some of us didn't miss it and and so we hit by the way you know how many times we interviewed and did pieces on Alexandria over a dozen times 34 videos all in all okay and when everybody's like oh she has no chance well apparently we thought she had a chance so we have 34 videos on her over a million views for a candidate that before nobody had heard of but we believed that's why we're home of the progressives okay so now the New York Times scrambling trying to figure out who the next candidates gonna be I'm gonna quote the New York Times guys and you're gonna love this the next race to watch is the August 7th Democratic primary for in Kansas that's in politically mixed suburban Kansas City where Clinton narrowly won in 2016 and labor lawyer Brent welder has the backing of Sanders and the p triple c now they didn't mention just democrats there and brent is a just democrat but that's okay god bless let's just get Brent's name out there it's almost as if we know how to pick up okay so they continued it on and on I'll give you one more paragraph but you should read the whole thing welder a Sanders delegates at the 2016 Democratic Commission is running on an agenda that includes single-payer health insurance in his hope of taking on Republican Kevin Yoder who was elected in the 2010 Republican wave when the GOP took over the house now they didn't mention the Yoder is already losing to Brent by seven points in a poll so that's awesome and they mentioned some of his opponents including my favorite Mike macam McCammon who is famous for and did York Times said if we told you this months and months ago but they said he's famous for leading from the center might not be working out okay so TYT Kansas dot-com we already raised in $50,000 for hiring staff to organize his volunteers and then we showed you the staff that you guys hired and they're in Kansas right now kicking ass okay now the next 30,000 is to make sure that everybody that district here's about Brent welder because when they hear the progressive message has happened in Ocasio Cortez race they love it the problem in the past was they never heard it because the money was drowning it out well we got hundreds of volunteers and we got you guys so let me see TYT Kansas comm China raisin thirty thousand dollars there last night it was a 235 the number of individual donors as I said can I see three hundred and the audience said wrong you'll see four hundred and fifty okay so now it's at four eighty one can I see six hundred by the end of the show just and it could be a dollar it could be five dollars it could be twenty seven it doesn't matter okay but small dollar donation is making giant difference let's go win the next one and the next one the next one but brent is up next TYT Kansas comm make that happen so great news all across the board for all
