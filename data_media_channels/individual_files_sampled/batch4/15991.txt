Ice Cube the wrapper is now involved in the NFL controversy and I will tell you why coming up today on the Hollywood conservative for the rebel I learned some surprising things today about rapper actor producer Ice Cube I guess I never really had a solid opinion of the guy because I don't really know him his rap group NWA in w80 that was way before my time I only ever really knew him as an actor but I started looking up interviews of him because of my story today and I learned some really surprising things first of all he just started a new basketball league of retired NBA stars he did an interview with CBS's Tracy Smith and frankly he sounds like a solid guy I think I can say that who thinks for himself he talks about his working-class parents he grew up in a gang neighborhood in LA but was raised in a two-parent household which we all know how highly uncommon that is I believe the statistics solidly sits at 24% for kids in the black community growing up without father so that could certainly be a part of his success but he says his father is his hero oh but I also found some of the comments that he made during this interview to be quite telling in discussing recruiting the retired NBA men who kind of get lost after leaving the pros he says this if you kept your game up we have a place for you and that's a great feeling gracious it almost sounds like he is in meritocrat test anyway before I dive into how he ties in with everything I've got to give you a little bit of background on a few other things first of all the NFL controversy everybody knows about that the kneeling the fists in the air as this past week I think during the preseason games it's been going on for a few seasons and I can only speak for myself but I think that I can collectively say that we are all very very sick of it no one even knows what they're protesting you ask one of these NFL players and they can't even define what it is they are so outraged over that they feel the need to disgrace and disrespect our flag our members of the millet and our law enforcement in the process so in recent months the dallas cowboys owner jerry brown has spoken on the topic saying i guess in a nutshell that his players will not be participating in any of the kneeling shenanigans the Cowboys quarterback is dak Prescott he was a college football star he played at Mississippi State when I was at Auburn we played him each season while he was there and believe me he gave my tiger's eye run for their money anyway he graduated from college went on to the NFL and when he was asked in a recent interview about these NFL protests he separated from his fellow players and said that he thought the NFL games were neither the time nor the venue to protest well of course shame on him how dare he step out of line with his kneeling brethren anyway he did and within a couple of days a mural went up in Dallas depicting Prescott as the character from the movie get out now if you haven't seen that movie it is about a black kid whose brain is basically taken over and he is mentally enslaved by rich white people so they're obviously making the comparison of Prescott being mentally enslaved and beholden to Cowboys owner Jerry Jones okay so here's how this ties in with icecube our national celebrity stalking news agency TMZ they caught up with icecube and asked him what he thought about dak Prescott being depicted this way and the backlash that he has received from his comments an IceCube said that the mural is quote-unquote BS but he said it and said that dak should quote/unquote do what you want to do man f everybody know nonsense and he's not wrong it's free speech the sad thing is is that nowadays free speech is getting very very expensive anyways happy Monday everybody thanks for watching I'm Amanda head the Hollywood conservative for the rebel if you enjoyed my commentary and want to hear more from all of us here at the rebels subscribe to our premium content at www.affordablecomm.com
