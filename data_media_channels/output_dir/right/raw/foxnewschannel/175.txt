STEVE: ONE THING THAT EVEN

2
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:07,573
PRESIDENT TRUMP'S BIGGEST

3
00:00:07,574 --> 00:00:08,941
CRITICS CAN'T SAY IS THAT

4
00:00:08,942 --> 00:00:10,109
HASN'T KEPT HIS PROMISES

5
00:00:10,110 --> 00:00:11,911
THOUGH HE HAS FALLEN SHORT

6
00:00:11,912 --> 00:00:12,945
ON A FEW OF THE CAMPAIGN

7
00:00:12,946 --> 00:00:13,613
PLEDGES, THE PRESIDENT HAS

8
00:00:13,614 --> 00:00:15,014
BEEN TRUE TO HIS WORD.

9
00:00:15,015 --> 00:00:16,349
A NEW OP-ED FROM "THE

10
00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:17,583
WASHINGTON POST ARGUES THAT

11
00:00:17,584 --> 00:00:18,818
PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS NOT ONLY

12
00:00:18,819 --> 00:00:20,786
KEPT HIS PROMISES, HE HAS

13
00:00:20,787 --> 00:00:24,023
SHOWN THAT HE IS THE MOST

14
00:00:24,024 --> 00:00:25,825
HONEST PRESIDENT EVER.

INSTITUTED MARC THIESSEN.

20
00:00:36,603 --> 00:00:38,938

21
00:00:38,939 --> 00:00:40,239
STEVE: HE IS THE MOST HONEST

22
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:41,707

TO US.

25
00:00:43,810 --> 00:00:45,745
>> WELL, SO HE -- IT'S

26
00:00:45,746 --> 00:00:46,879
OBVIOUS THAT THE PRESIDENT

27
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:48,281
TAKES LIBERTIES WITH THE

28
00:00:48,282 --> 00:00:49,448
TRUTH THOUGH HE WAS

29
00:00:49,449 --> 00:00:50,750
CERTAINLY RIGHT ABOUT

30
00:00:50,751 --> 00:00:52,218
ELIZABETH WARREN THAT'S FOR

31
00:00:52,219 --> 00:00:52,518
SURE.

32
00:00:52,519 --> 00:00:55,288
WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE REAL

33
00:00:55,289 --> 00:00:56,856
BAROMETER OF PRESIDENTIAL

34
00:00:56,857 --> 00:00:58,257
TRUTHFULNESS WHICH IS

35
00:00:58,258 --> 00:00:58,858
PROMISE-KEEPING HE IS

36
00:00:58,859 --> 00:00:59,859
PROBABLY THE MOST HONEST

37
00:00:59,860 --> 00:01:01,160
PRESIDENT IN AMERICAN

38
00:01:01,161 --> 00:01:02,762
HISTORY FOR BETTER OR WORSE

39
00:01:02,763 --> 00:01:03,362
WHETHER YOU AGREE OR

40
00:01:03,363 --> 00:01:04,230
DISAGREE WITH HIS POLICIES

41
00:01:04,230 --> 00:01:06,866
HE HAS DONE EXACTLY WHAT HE

42
00:01:06,867 --> 00:01:09,869
WOULD DO AS PRESIDENT.

43
00:01:09,870 --> 00:01:11,437
MOVE THE EMBASSY TO

44
00:01:11,438 --> 00:01:13,472
JERUSALEM AND RECOGNIZE AS

45
00:01:13,473 --> 00:01:13,973
CAPITAL.

46
00:01:13,974 --> 00:01:15,041
THREE ADMINISTRATIONS

47
00:01:15,042 --> 00:01:15,741
PROMISED TO DO THAT HE IS

48
00:01:15,742 --> 00:01:17,910
THE ONLY ONE DELIVERED.

49
00:01:17,911 --> 00:01:18,911
PROMISED TO DESTROY ISIS.

50
00:01:18,912 --> 00:01:20,813
HE PROMISED TO IMPOSE A

51
00:01:20,814 --> 00:01:21,714
TRAVEL BAN.

52
00:01:21,715 --> 00:01:22,848
I PERSONALLY DON'T AGREE

53
00:01:22,849 --> 00:01:23,883
WITH THE TRAVEL BADGE.

54
00:01:23,884 --> 00:01:25,017
HE PROMISED TO DO AND IT THE

55
00:01:25,018 --> 00:01:26,619
SUPREME COURT UPHELD IT.

56
00:01:26,620 --> 00:01:28,321
ON THE ECONOMY HE PROMISED A

57
00:01:28,322 --> 00:01:30,022
TAX REFORM AND MASSIVE

58
00:01:30,023 --> 00:01:30,690
REGULATORY ROLL BACK.

59
00:01:30,691 --> 00:01:32,258
HE HAS DONE IT ON ENERGY, HE

60
00:01:32,259 --> 00:01:35,828
PROM MISSIONED TO OPEN UP

61
00:01:35,829 --> 00:01:37,897
THE ARTIC ANWR AND APPROVE

62
00:01:37,898 --> 00:01:39,465
THE KEYSTONE AND DO COAT

63
00:01:39,466 --> 00:01:40,733
ACCESS PIPELINES AND PULL

64
00:01:40,734 --> 00:01:41,767
OUT OF THE PARIS CLIMATE

65
00:01:41,768 --> 00:01:42,868
ACCORD AND HE HAS DONE IT

66
00:01:42,869 --> 00:01:44,337
YOU GO DOWN THE LIST OF

67
00:01:44,338 --> 00:01:46,606
THINGS HE PROMISED TO DO HE

68
00:01:46,607 --> 00:01:47,974
HAS DONE THEM ONE AFTER

69
00:01:47,975 --> 00:01:48,307
ANOTHER.

70
00:01:48,308 --> 00:01:50,243
WHEN IT COMES TO HONESTY

71
00:01:50,244 --> 00:01:52,511
WHAT AMERICANS EXPECT FROM A

72
00:01:52,512 --> 00:01:52,878
PRESIDENT.

73
00:01:52,879 --> 00:01:53,879
THEY EXPECT THEM TO KEEP

74
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:54,780
THEIR PROMISES AND DONALD

75
00:01:54,781 --> 00:01:56,782
TRUMP DOES THAT EVERY DAY.

76
00:01:56,783 --> 00:01:57,683
STEVE: FOR THE THINGS HE HAS

77
00:01:57,684 --> 00:01:58,851
NOT BEEN ABLE TO ACHIEVE

78
00:01:58,852 --> 00:02:00,653
LIKE THE WALL OR REPEALING

79
00:02:00,654 --> 00:02:01,020
OBAMACARE.

80
00:02:01,021 --> 00:02:02,755
NO, HE HAS TRIED HARD BUT HE

81
00:02:02,756 --> 00:02:06,559
IS IN WASHINGTON.

82
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:08,461
>> THAT'S ABSOLUTELY RIGHT.

83
00:02:08,461 --> 00:02:09,794
HE HAS MADE AN EFFORT AND

84
00:02:09,795 --> 00:02:11,062
DEMOCRATIC OBSTRUCTION AND

85
00:02:11,064 --> 00:02:12,531
RESISTANCE THAT HAS BLOCKED

86
00:02:12,532 --> 00:02:14,000
IT OR IN THE CASE OF

87
00:02:14,001 --> 00:02:15,401
OBAMACARE, IT'S BEEN, YOU

88
00:02:15,402 --> 00:02:16,435
KNOW, ONE VOTE ON THE

89
00:02:16,436 --> 00:02:17,136
REPUBLICAN SIDE.

90
00:02:17,137 --> 00:02:19,572
AND THEN WHEN HE HAS PULLED

91
00:02:19,573 --> 00:02:21,941
BACK ON THE CAMPAIGN PROMISE

92
00:02:21,942 --> 00:02:23,142
LIKE PULLING TROOPS OUT OF

93
00:02:23,143 --> 00:02:24,410
AFGHANISTAN, IT WAS AFTER A

94
00:02:24,411 --> 00:02:25,878
CAREFUL REVIEW, IF YOU READ

95
00:02:25,879 --> 00:02:28,481
BOB WOODWARD'S BOOK, IT'S

96
00:02:28,482 --> 00:02:28,881
COMFORTING.

97
00:02:28,882 --> 00:02:30,950
TOOK A CAREFUL REVIEW SPENT

98
00:02:30,951 --> 00:02:34,553
A LOT OF TIME GRILLING HIS

99
00:02:34,554 --> 00:02:35,554
AND THAT'S WHAT YOU WANT A

100
00:02:35,555 --> 00:02:36,856
PRESIDENT TO DO.

101
00:02:36,857 --> 00:02:37,623
STEVE: HIS JOB APPROVAL

102
00:02:37,624 --> 00:02:39,158
NUMBER HAS BEEN GOING UP.

103
00:02:39,159 --> 00:02:41,160
ABC NEWS POLL SHOWS TRUMP

104
00:02:41,161 --> 00:02:45,464
HAS 41% APPROVAL UP FROM 36%

105
00:02:45,465 --> 00:02:46,966
IN AUGUST.

106
00:02:46,967 --> 00:02:47,833
MARC, WHEN YOU LOOK AT

107
00:02:47,834 --> 00:02:48,634
HEADLINES FROM ORGANIZATIONS

108
00:02:48,635 --> 00:02:49,969
THAT ARE NOT NECESSARILY IN

109
00:02:49,970 --> 00:02:51,304
HIS CAMP, THEY GIVE HIM

110
00:02:51,305 --> 00:02:52,338
CREDIT FOR THE ECONOMY.

111
00:02:52,339 --> 00:02:53,172
CNN, TRUMP IS RIGHT.

112
00:02:53,173 --> 00:02:54,440
THE ECONOMY IS DOING WELL

113
00:02:54,441 --> 00:02:56,475
ANSWERED DESERVES SOME

114
00:02:56,476 --> 00:02:56,809
CREDIT.

115
00:02:56,810 --> 00:03:00,146
NPR, U.S. ECONOMY SURGES TO

116
00:03:00,147 --> 00:03:01,981
4.1% PACE SECOND QUARTER IN

117
00:03:01,982 --> 00:03:03,482
THE CHICAGO TRIB.

118
00:03:03,483 --> 00:03:04,583
THIS IS WHAT A BOOMING

119
00:03:04,584 --> 00:03:05,518
ECONOMY FEELS LIKE.

120
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:06,652
THAT'S GOT TO MAKE THE

121
00:03:06,653 --> 00:03:07,787
PRESIDENT FEEL LIKE HE IS ON

122
00:03:07,788 --> 00:03:09,422
THE RIGHT TRACK.

123
00:03:09,423 --> 00:03:10,122
>> ABSOLUTELY.

124
00:03:10,123 --> 00:03:11,057
HERE IS THE RIGHT THING.

125
00:03:11,058 --> 00:03:13,526
THE ECONOMY IS RISING 4.2

126
00:03:13,527 --> 00:03:15,027
POURS ECONOMIC GROWTH.

127
00:03:15,028 --> 00:03:15,728
BEST MANUFACTURING JOB

128
00:03:15,729 --> 00:03:17,430
GROWTH IN 23 YEARS.

129
00:03:17,431 --> 00:03:18,931
LOWEST UNEMPLOYMENT CLAIMS

130
00:03:18,932 --> 00:03:20,266
IN 23 YEARS.

131
00:03:20,267 --> 00:03:21,534
THE COMMITTEE IS BOOMING.

132
00:03:21,535 --> 00:03:22,902
HIS APPROVAL RATING IS NOT.

133
00:03:22,903 --> 00:03:24,804
YOU HAVE TO ASK YOURSELF WHY

134
00:03:24,805 --> 00:03:25,705
IS THAT?

135
00:03:25,706 --> 00:03:26,972
THERE SHOULD BE MILLIONS OF

136
00:03:26,973 --> 00:03:28,374
AMERICANS WHO ARE SEEING THE

137
00:03:28,375 --> 00:03:29,508
EFFECTS OF THE TRUMP ECONOMY

138
00:03:29,509 --> 00:03:30,910
WHO HAVE BEEN LIFTED UP BY

139
00:03:30,911 --> 00:03:32,578
THE TRUMP ECONOMY.

140
00:03:32,579 --> 00:03:33,746
I OUGHT TO GIVE THIS GUY A

141
00:03:33,747 --> 00:03:34,914
SECOND LOOK AND THAT'S NOT

142
00:03:34,915 --> 00:03:35,281
HAPPENING.

143
00:03:35,282 --> 00:03:36,549
THE QUESTION IS WHY IS THAT?

144
00:03:36,550 --> 00:03:37,383
ONE OF THE REASONS IS

145
00:03:37,384 --> 00:03:39,285
BECAUSE HE HAS NOT -- HE HAS

146
00:03:39,286 --> 00:03:40,853
BEEN VERY FOCUSED ON FEEDING

147
00:03:40,854 --> 00:03:41,287
HIS BASE.

148
00:03:41,288 --> 00:03:43,322
HE HAS NOT BEEN AS FOCUSED

149
00:03:43,323 --> 00:03:44,890
ON REACHING TOUT PEOPLE WHO

150
00:03:44,891 --> 00:03:46,459
DON'T YET AGREE WITH HIM WHO

151
00:03:46,460 --> 00:03:47,126
COULD BE COMING.

152
00:03:47,127 --> 00:00:00,000
IN HE NEEDS TO DO A BETTER
