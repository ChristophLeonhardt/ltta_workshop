00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,979
hi<font color="#E5E5E5"> everyone so yesterday I tweeted that</font>

2
00:00:01,979 --> 00:00:03,389
I've been standing up myself a lot more

3
00:00:03,389 --> 00:00:04,680
recently and then it's been a<font color="#E5E5E5"> wonderful</font>

4
00:00:04,680 --> 00:00:06,359
amazing thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I got</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> really</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> big</font>

5
00:00:06,359 --> 00:00:07,680
response to that lots of people wanted

6
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:09,360
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> know how lots people wanting advice</font>

7
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:11,130
generally even though i'm about to give

8
00:00:11,130 --> 00:00:12,599
you a list<font color="#E5E5E5"> of five ways to stand up for</font>

9
00:00:12,599 --> 00:00:14,490
yourself it's not things that can be

10
00:00:14,490 --> 00:00:17,369
<font color="#E5E5E5">easily accepted and internalized it's</font>

11
00:00:17,369 --> 00:00:18,810
some things that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have to work</font>

12
00:00:18,810 --> 00:00:21,029
towards understanding for yourself part

13
00:00:21,029 --> 00:00:22,560
of that<font color="#E5E5E5"> is through experience standing</font>

14
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:24,480
up for yourself which makes it kind of a

15
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:28,349
weird paradox and then also part of that

16
00:00:28,349 --> 00:00:30,390
is doing things like reading books like

17
00:00:30,390 --> 00:00:32,040
cleaning and valuing those discussions

18
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:34,920
and valuing working on<font color="#CCCCCC"> yourself but I've</font>

19
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:35,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">come to believe that learning to stand</font>

20
00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:36,960
up<font color="#CCCCCC"> for yourself is one of the most</font>

21
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:38,160
important things that you can learn and

22
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:40,050
also that I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> very lucky because I have</font>

23
00:00:40,050 --> 00:00:41,670
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> really great group of friends we</font>

24
00:00:41,670 --> 00:00:43,230
talked about the sort<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> stuff I have</font>

25
00:00:43,230 --> 00:00:44,670
ways to stand<font color="#E5E5E5"> up for yourself first</font>

26
00:00:44,670 --> 00:00:46,379
don't feel<font color="#CCCCCC"> like you have to apologize</font>

27
00:00:46,379 --> 00:00:48,239
<font color="#CCCCCC">for everything that's a big thing that's</font>

28
00:00:48,239 --> 00:00:49,980
in like in writing that I've been

29
00:00:49,980 --> 00:00:51,840
reading a lot recently but it's also so

30
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:53,280
true the other day I was attitude

31
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:55,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">platform and this guy came up to me</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

32
00:00:55,110 --> 00:00:56,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">there something really creepy but</font>

33
00:00:56,460 --> 00:00:57,660
because I jumped because I was<font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> very</font>

34
00:00:57,660 --> 00:00:59,579
surprised<font color="#CCCCCC"> to see</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> him I apologize as well</font>

35
00:00:59,579 --> 00:01:01,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">and my default reaction is to apologize</font>

36
00:01:01,710 --> 00:01:04,080
and that kind of shows up a<font color="#CCCCCC"> lot and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm</font>

37
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:05,129
talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> to other people about things</font>

38
00:01:05,129 --> 00:01:08,310
that I<font color="#E5E5E5"> am NOT okay with I'm like oh I'm</font>

39
00:01:08,310 --> 00:01:09,600
really<font color="#CCCCCC"> sorry for saying this I'm really</font>

40
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:10,950
sorry for thinking this but this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> what</font>

41
00:01:10,950 --> 00:01:12,360
I think I don't think that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> good way</font>

42
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:14,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">to preface any form of standing up for</font>

43
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:15,509
yourself I think you have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> teach</font>

44
00:01:15,509 --> 00:01:17,100
yourself<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you don't have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

45
00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:19,409
apologize<font color="#E5E5E5"> for having that opinion which</font>

46
00:01:19,409 --> 00:01:21,119
goes on<font color="#E5E5E5"> to number two you are allowed an</font>

47
00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:23,070
opinion as long as<font color="#CCCCCC"> you open to the idea</font>

48
00:01:23,070 --> 00:01:24,330
that you might<font color="#E5E5E5"> be wrong I mean like</font>

49
00:01:24,330 --> 00:01:26,159
that's an important caveat but you are

50
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:28,799
completely allowed an opinion and<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

51
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:30,720
also are allowed to<font color="#E5E5E5"> feel fairly certain</font>

52
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:32,130
about it as well<font color="#E5E5E5"> and in this</font>

53
00:01:32,130 --> 00:01:33,390
conversation sometimes it might come

54
00:01:33,390 --> 00:01:34,619
<font color="#CCCCCC">about that you do</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have to admit you're</font>

55
00:01:34,619 --> 00:01:36,450
wrong and admitting you're wrong can be

56
00:01:36,450 --> 00:01:38,369
horrible and you are inclined to get

57
00:01:38,369 --> 00:01:39,900
defensive but here's the thing a<font color="#CCCCCC"> lot the</font>

58
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:41,430
time you don't know how your opinion

59
00:01:41,430 --> 00:01:43,079
works until you talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> about it and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> how</font>

60
00:01:43,079 --> 00:01:44,790
the other sides of that happening works

61
00:01:44,790 --> 00:01:45,930
especially if you're seeing something

62
00:01:45,930 --> 00:01:48,360
just can't see another possibility for

63
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:50,909
that opinion for that<font color="#E5E5E5"> point of view you</font>

64
00:01:50,909 --> 00:01:52,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">have to just</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> talk about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it and have to</font>

65
00:01:52,380 --> 00:01:54,000
get<font color="#E5E5E5"> those other points of view this was</font>

66
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:54,869
thinking when you're having those

67
00:01:54,869 --> 00:01:57,299
conversations that person who needs to

68
00:01:57,299 --> 00:01:59,880
change their mind is feeling<font color="#CCCCCC"> embarrassed</font>

69
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:01,560
probably and it would be<font color="#E5E5E5"> more</font>

70
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:03,390
embarrassing for them to publicly admit

71
00:02:03,390 --> 00:02:04,770
that they want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> change their mind and</font>

72
00:02:04,770 --> 00:02:06,719
they are likely to get defensive but

73
00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:07,740
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> what ever you need as part of</font>

74
00:02:07,740 --> 00:02:09,330
standing<font color="#E5E5E5"> up for yourself and it's part</font>

75
00:02:09,330 --> 00:02:11,220
of understanding how people work lucky

76
00:02:11,220 --> 00:02:12,720
number<font color="#E5E5E5"> three not everyone is going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

77
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:13,500
like you

78
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:16,140
it's like a really thing to say but

79
00:02:16,140 --> 00:02:17,490
not everyone is<font color="#CCCCCC"> gonna like you and</font>

80
00:02:17,490 --> 00:02:19,590
that's fine like it doesn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> mean</font>

81
00:02:19,590 --> 00:02:21,000
everyone's going to hate you and be

82
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,070
horrible about<font color="#CCCCCC"> your</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> time and like just</font>

83
00:02:23,070 --> 00:02:24,540
constantly be thinking about you<font color="#CCCCCC"> in a</font>

84
00:02:24,540 --> 00:02:26,460
negative way but just doesn't mean that

85
00:02:26,460 --> 00:02:27,570
there were going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be in love with you</font>

86
00:02:27,570 --> 00:02:29,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">some people honestly just won't care and</font>

87
00:02:29,190 --> 00:02:30,360
that in itself could feel horrible

88
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:31,709
because we're taught that being relevant

89
00:02:31,709 --> 00:02:33,570
matters and not only<font color="#E5E5E5"> we taught that we</font>

90
00:02:33,570 --> 00:02:36,240
taught how to be relevant<font color="#E5E5E5"> and we're told</font>

91
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:37,860
that we have to do<font color="#E5E5E5"> certain things and</font>

92
00:02:37,860 --> 00:02:39,540
tick certain boxes to being relevant

93
00:02:39,540 --> 00:02:42,120
especially a celebrity culture for many

94
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:44,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">asses women for many of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> us as</font>

95
00:02:44,780 --> 00:02:47,700
impressionable people and it's part of

96
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:49,320
advertising and it's part of a social

97
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:51,150
thing and this you know there's all the

98
00:02:51,150 --> 00:02:52,860
stuff that's telling us how to be

99
00:02:52,860 --> 00:02:54,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">relevant but I promise you you are</font>

100
00:02:54,690 --> 00:02:56,100
relevant the only thing I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think when you</font>

101
00:02:56,100 --> 00:02:57,450
<font color="#CCCCCC">think about when it comes to relevance</font>

102
00:02:57,450 --> 00:02:59,670
is respect and respecting yourself and

103
00:02:59,670 --> 00:03:01,080
respecting other people which is

104
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:02,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">basically what number four is you</font>

105
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:06,180
deserve<font color="#E5E5E5"> you deserve as much respect as</font>

106
00:03:06,180 --> 00:03:07,920
you give other people I for a very long

107
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:09,959
time def<font color="#CCCCCC"> knee gave a lot</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of other people</font>

108
00:03:09,959 --> 00:03:12,750
respect no really admired them and I

109
00:03:12,750 --> 00:03:14,760
really treated them well but<font color="#CCCCCC"> I didn't</font>

110
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:16,230
ever feel like I decided<font color="#CCCCCC"> that respect</font>

111
00:03:16,230 --> 00:03:17,519
like I hadn't earned it yet because I

112
00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:19,620
<font color="#CCCCCC">wasn't old enough or whatever because I</font>

113
00:03:19,620 --> 00:03:22,590
was crazy I don't even know like I just

114
00:03:22,590 --> 00:03:24,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">I didn't ever feel like I deserve</font>

115
00:03:24,180 --> 00:03:26,040
<font color="#CCCCCC">respect but you do you all deserve</font>

116
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:27,780
respect doesn't mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> can be a</font>

117
00:03:27,780 --> 00:03:29,220
complete dick about it because you do

118
00:03:29,220 --> 00:03:30,330
need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to give that respect to other</font>

119
00:03:30,330 --> 00:03:32,250
people as well but<font color="#E5E5E5"> you also do have to</font>

120
00:03:32,250 --> 00:03:33,900
respect their opinions all the time you

121
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:34,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">respect their right to have an opinion</font>

122
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:37,760
but if their opinion is crappy and

123
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:39,810
ridiculous you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> call them out on it</font>

124
00:03:39,810 --> 00:03:40,950
that's fine there's a big part of

125
00:03:40,950 --> 00:03:42,030
standing<font color="#E5E5E5"> up for yourself as well it's</font>

126
00:03:42,030 --> 00:03:44,670
like oh yeah it's hard it's complicated

127
00:03:44,670 --> 00:03:45,989
<font color="#E5E5E5">because like what do you respecting what</font>

128
00:03:45,989 --> 00:03:47,970
you don't respect and what makes you not

129
00:03:47,970 --> 00:03:50,970
aware of other people being their own

130
00:03:50,970 --> 00:03:52,380
little entities and going on in their

131
00:03:52,380 --> 00:03:53,850
own little heads what makes things

132
00:03:53,850 --> 00:03:55,320
changed like nothing's ever going to

133
00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:56,730
change if no one ever does anything and

134
00:03:56,730 --> 00:03:57,690
I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> not the time standing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> up for</font>

135
00:03:57,690 --> 00:03:58,950
yourself is so difficult because it

136
00:03:58,950 --> 00:04:01,230
interrupts this very calm and natural

137
00:04:01,230 --> 00:04:02,549
way that we've learnt function around

138
00:04:02,549 --> 00:04:03,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">each other because it makes things</font>

139
00:04:03,690 --> 00:04:05,340
easier like that brushing the thing

140
00:04:05,340 --> 00:04:07,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">under the rug it is a lot easier to just</font>

141
00:04:07,980 --> 00:04:09,870
keep going with the status<font color="#CCCCCC"> quo</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and not</font>

142
00:04:09,870 --> 00:04:11,910
and not having those difficult

143
00:04:11,910 --> 00:04:13,620
conversations that interrupt things that

144
00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:15,000
<font color="#CCCCCC">also doesn't make it any better for</font>

145
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,680
anyone I don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> think and the last</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> thing</font>

146
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:18,358
<font color="#E5E5E5">which i think is kind of coming across</font>

147
00:04:18,358 --> 00:04:19,798
in this video's I'm getting more all

148
00:04:19,798 --> 00:04:22,108
riled up thank you<font color="#CCCCCC"> better in a way is to</font>

149
00:04:22,108 --> 00:04:26,290
be clear and direct but but

150
00:04:26,290 --> 00:04:29,230
important you are not any weaker or less

151
00:04:29,230 --> 00:04:31,750
correct or less entitled to your opinion

152
00:04:31,750 --> 00:04:34,630
because<font color="#CCCCCC"> your emotional or because you</font>

153
00:04:34,630 --> 00:04:37,330
are fumbling your words and people will

154
00:04:37,330 --> 00:04:38,740
catch you out because of that<font color="#CCCCCC"> because</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

155
00:04:38,740 --> 00:04:39,790
say oh you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> just being emotional</font>

156
00:04:39,790 --> 00:04:41,380
you're just being hysterical you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font>

157
00:04:41,380 --> 00:04:43,870
being five or ten or<font color="#E5E5E5"> fifteen or twenty</font>

158
00:04:43,870 --> 00:04:46,000
one or whatever like no that is<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

159
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,430
valid as much as possible try and take a

160
00:04:48,430 --> 00:04:50,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">deep breath and move on and collect</font>

161
00:04:50,740 --> 00:04:52,210
yourself but sometimes<font color="#CCCCCC"> that won't be</font>

162
00:04:52,210 --> 00:04:54,070
possible and that<font color="#E5E5E5"> doesn't make what you</font>

163
00:04:54,070 --> 00:04:55,960
have to say any less valid and when you

164
00:04:55,960 --> 00:04:57,460
know that and you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can say what I know</font>

165
00:04:57,460 --> 00:04:58,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">I'm mess right now but this is something</font>

166
00:04:58,750 --> 00:05:00,760
that really matters to<font color="#E5E5E5"> me and don't also</font>

167
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:02,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">be afraid if you don't get emotional and</font>

168
00:05:02,650 --> 00:05:04,660
people<font color="#E5E5E5"> just think you're picking a fight</font>

169
00:05:04,660 --> 00:05:06,160
and just be like well yeah I know I'm

170
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:07,390
<font color="#CCCCCC">not into this right now but doesn't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> mean</font>

171
00:05:07,390 --> 00:05:09,100
it doesn't matter to me so it works both

172
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:10,840
ways those are just some things I've

173
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:12,310
been<font color="#E5E5E5"> learning and I've</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> gasps</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I set up</font>

174
00:05:12,310 --> 00:05:13,600
and trying to internalise because it's

175
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:14,710
one thing to acknowledge them and

176
00:05:14,710 --> 00:05:16,480
another thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> make yourself really</font>

177
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:18,160
really believe them but I'm getting

178
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:19,480
there and I hope some of you are getting

179
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:20,980
there as well I hope all of you getting

180
00:05:20,980 --> 00:05:23,500
there as well and I hope that you will

181
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:25,060
feel like it's okay<font color="#CCCCCC"> to send up for</font>

182
00:05:25,060 --> 00:05:26,770
yourself because it's not only<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay it's</font>

183
00:05:26,770 --> 00:05:28,210
great and it's good and you should

184
00:05:28,210 --> 00:05:31,390
really assert your right to be a<font color="#CCCCCC"> person</font>

185
00:05:31,390 --> 00:05:32,800
but I do completely van on understa

186
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:34,750
specially with the internet like it's

187
00:05:34,750 --> 00:05:36,400
changing or not as well because it is

188
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:37,960
scarier to stand up for yourself knowing

189
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:39,730
that people in<font color="#CCCCCC"> two or three</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> years time</font>

190
00:05:39,730 --> 00:05:41,200
will call<font color="#E5E5E5"> you out on that opinion and</font>

191
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:43,300
still hold it as a current opinion like

192
00:05:43,300 --> 00:05:44,950
that's another side of it that makes it

193
00:05:44,950 --> 00:05:46,420
really difficult but yeah I hope<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

194
