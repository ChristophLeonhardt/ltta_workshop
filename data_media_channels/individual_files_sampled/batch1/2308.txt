I was surprised by how much evidence there is that to be happy and even to be healthy we really need to have strong relationships with other people well what is the key to happiness there's a couple different ways you could answer that question depending on how you frame it but one thing absolutely that ancient philosophers and contemporary scientists would agree is that a key and perhaps the key to happiness is relationships we need to feel like we can confide we have to feel like we belong we have to be able to get support and just as important for happiness we need to be able to give support we need enduring intimate bond so anytime you're trying to think about how to be happier thinking about relationships whether it's deepening relationships or broadening relationships is probably something that's going to be really helpful for you in making yourself happier so if you're debating like should I go to all the trouble to go to my college reunion or should I spring for the expense of going to my friend's wedding or should I bother to join that book group or should I does it make sense for me to spend a little time chatting with my co-workers instead of just like sitting down and getting my work done if it's something that's going to strengthen a relationship it's probably something that's going to boost your happiness in the long run and I was just surprised by how consistently that shows up in sort of any way you look at happiness and health this is a result that just over and over it comes up
