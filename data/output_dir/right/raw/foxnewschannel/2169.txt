34
00:00:56,218 --> 00:00:56,885
STEVE: WHY DO YOU THINK THE

35
00:00:56,885 --> 00:00:57,486
PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED

36
00:00:57,486 --> 00:01:00,923

00:01:00,923 --> 00:01:01,356

>> YOU KNOW, EVENTS ON THE

39
00:01:03,525 --> 00:01:04,025
KOREAN PENINSULA.

40
00:01:04,025 --> 00:01:05,093
THE LEADER OF NORTH KOREA

41
00:01:05,093 --> 00:01:05,794
AND SOUTH KOREA COMING

42
00:01:05,794 --> 00:01:07,429
TOGETHER WOULD HAVE BEEN

43
00:01:07,429 --> 00:01:08,196
UNIMAGINABLE JUST A FEW

44
00:01:08,196 --> 00:01:09,064
WEEKS AGO.

45
00:01:09,064 --> 00:01:10,232
FRANKLY THE RESPONSE FROM

46
00:01:10,232 --> 00:01:12,234
MANY IN THE MEDIA HAS BEEN

47
00:01:12,234 --> 00:01:13,468
MUTED AND I THINK PRESIDENT

48
00:01:13,468 --> 00:01:15,671
TRUMP IS SHOWING THAT PEACE

49
00:01:15,671 --> 00:01:17,139
THROUGH STRENGTH IS WORKING

50
00:01:17,139 --> 00:01:19,174
AND THE ONLY REASON THAT THE

51
00:01:19,174 --> 00:01:20,275
EVIL DICTATOR FROM NORTH

52
00:01:20,275 --> 00:01:21,710
KOREA IS COMING TO THE TABLE

53
00:01:21,710 --> 00:01:24,146
IS BECAUSE THIS PRESIDENT

54
00:01:24,146 --> 00:01:25,447
HAS STARED HIM DOWN.

55
00:01:25,447 --> 00:01:27,316
AND AS PEACE COMES TO THE

56
00:01:27,316 --> 00:01:29,284
KOREAN PENINSULA, DO I

57
00:01:29,284 --> 00:01:31,120
BELIEVE PRESIDENT TRUMP

58
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:33,555
DESERVES THE NOBEL PEACE

59
00:01:33,555 --> 00:01:33,922
PRIZE.

60
00:01:33,922 --> 00:01:34,556
STEVE: CHAIRMAN, IT DOES

61
00:01:34,556 --> 00:01:35,624
LOOK AS IF THERE ARE

62
00:01:35,624 --> 00:01:36,859
TANGIBLE RULES THAT HE IS

63
00:01:36,859 --> 00:01:37,793
GETTING THINGS DONE, BECAUSE

64
00:01:37,793 --> 00:01:39,094
NOT ONLY WILL THE LOCATION

65
00:01:39,094 --> 00:01:40,596

66
00:01:40,596 --> 00:01:42,798

00:01:43,866 --> 00:01:44,900
STORY IS THE FACT THAT IT

69
00:01:44,900 --> 00:01:45,934
SOUNDS LIKE THE NORTH

70
00:01:45,934 --> 00:01:47,202
KOREANS ARE ABOUT TO RELEASE

71
00:01:47,202 --> 00:01:48,270
THOSE THREE AMERICANS, JUST

72
00:01:48,270 --> 00:01:49,838
TO SHOW THAT THEY WANT TO

73
00:01:49,838 --> 00:01:52,174
WHEEL AND DEAL WITH THIS

74
00:01:52,174 --> 00:01:52,741
PRESIDENT.

00:01:55,044 --> 00:01:57,379
LISTEN, WE ARE A LONG WAY

78
00:01:57,379 --> 00:01:57,679

79
00:01:57,679 --> 00:01:58,714
THIS NORTH KOREAN LEADER IS

80
00:01:58,714 --> 00:02:00,716
A RUTHLESS GUY WHO HAS LIED

81
00:02:00,716 --> 00:02:02,384
TO PEOPLE BEFORE THERE ARE

82
00:02:02,384 --> 00:02:03,318
TANGIBLE STEPS ALREADY

00:02:03,318 --> 00:02:03,685
HAPPENING.

KOREA, TALKING ABOUT ENDING

87
00:02:09,358 --> 00:02:10,425
THOSE NUCLEAR PROGRAMS.

88
00:02:10,425 --> 00:02:11,327
THE NORTH KOREAN LEADER HAS

89
00:02:11,327 --> 00:02:13,329
ALREADY ENDED HIS TESTING

90
00:02:13,329 --> 00:02:13,796
PROGRAM.

91
00:02:13,796 --> 00:02:14,797
THERE ARE MAJOR STEPS

92
00:02:14,797 --> 00:02:16,065
HAPPENING AND, AGAIN, THE

93
00:02:16,065 --> 00:02:16,999
ONLY REASON IT'S HAPPENING

94
00:02:16,999 --> 00:02:18,534
IS BECAUSE OF THIS

95
00:02:18,534 --> 00:02:19,702
PRESIDENT'S STRONG

96
00:02:19,702 --> 00:02:20,102

00:02:28,978 --> 00:02:30,246
RESPONDING RIGHT NOW IF THIS

105
00:02:30,246 --> 00:02:31,915

NOBEL PEACE PRIZE BEFORE HE

122
00:02:51,234 --> 00:02:51,801
