Donald Trump has had his first medical exam as president and the results indicate that he's extremely healthy its cholesterol a little high but according to the doctor that analyzed his health he is in good shape dr. Ronnie Jackson is the person who conducted these tests and it not only incorporated a physical exam but also a cognitive exam because of the fact that so many people have been questioning Trump's mental fitness for office now according to the official medical record Trump stands at 75 inches tall or 6 feet 3 inches tall and weighs 239 pounds which indicates that he is overweight but his BMI indicates that he is not considered obese his doctor was quoted as saying Trump has incredible genes and if he had a healthier diet over the past 20 years he might live to be 200 in fact why don't we hear from his doctor again this is the same doctor by the way who performed medical exams on Obama so it doesn't appear that there is any type of partisan issue here but I want you to hear from him yourself so take a look guy who eats McDonald's identified chicks with all those diet cokes and never exercises isn't as good a shape that he stays in it's called genetics I don't know it's some people have you know just great genes you know I told the president that he had a healthier diet over the last 20 years he might live to be 200 years old I don't know I mean he he has incredible he has incredible genes I just assume okay so he has incredible genes now that was something that was covered by Genki on yesterday's show but there's a little twist and the twist of the story is that these medical reports have now led to the so-called birther movement awesome a play on the birther movement obviously which was something that Trump pushed for when he claimed that Obama wasn't born in the United States and used to show everyone his birth certificate now the girth er movement I believe was coined by Chris Hayes he tweeted about it as anyone coined birther for the those who believe the president weighs more than his doctor reports and then the conspiracy theories began the comparisons between Trump and athletes Trump and our former President Barack Obama now Brock Obama's height was six foot one and this new medical report on Trump indicates he's six foot three but if you look at pictures of them standing side by side that doesn't appear to be the case well you know Ben mankiewicz says pictures don't tell a thousand words they lie so it could depend on the angle etc so I I'm not a guru and by the way I don't know if you know this but I'm 160 pounds are you really know sorry because I my mind went nevermind I'm not gonna okay so I'm largely going to defend Donald Trump on this because it's a pointless conspiracy so what right even if he's lying and I don't know why the doctor would lie the doctor is a super legit doctor he's been the White House doctor since 2013 it's not important it's not relevant but you know that's the thing about conspiracy theories the minute they start they start to look more more plausible every minute so then the people found out that on his driver's license he's actually listed as six-foot-two now I look at that and go who cares 6-3 6-2 was a big deal but then hold on hold on then I read a little bit more into it people are like if he was 6 2 and 239 pounds trumps he would go from being overweight categorically based on BMI to obese now is there anyone in the country who would care about whether they're called obese or not more than Donald Trump right something like wait that's a little plausible right and then yesterday when I covered this story and I showed that same clip I noted like Ronnie Jackson is sweating his ass off up there ok he's like on the lights and he's like frazzled and he's like no no it's true it's true he's 239 pounds it's 30 out of 30 on the cognitive score but so what there's lights there and it doesn't mean anything but you start to put it together oh yeah you know it's it's interesting because I think the girth er movement is funny mostly because it's a play off of the birther movement you know Oh a name alone it's taking off it's pretty funny um I don't like I don't I don't really like nitpicking about like his weight you know what I mean it makes me uncomfortable it also makes me uncomfortable when people speculate about his mental health I will admit that his behavior seems erratic he seems to do things that don't seem normal say things that don't seem normal but based on this you know cognitive tests that he was given he shows no signs of dementia or Alzheimer's the exact test that they gave him is known as the Montreal cognitive assessment and it's a very simple test but apparently it's very effective in determining whether or not an individual has dementia or Alzheimer's now it detects 94% of people who do have dementia and a score of 26 or lower indicates that you probably are developing dementia now he received a score of 30 but what they do is they have you draw a cube and then you know what I mean like it's not like they gave him a genius test you know like people are treating it as if like that smarts mad America no he just he doesn't have signs of dementia which is a good thing good I'm glad he doesn't now there's more that I want to get to because Sanjay Gupta has immersed himself in the middle of this controversy because he believes that Trump does in fact have heart disease okay so let's go to graphic 33 according to Gupta he found that trumps coronary calcium score was alarming noting Jackson's data that shows in 2009 it was 34 and in 2018 it's 133 any score above 100 is at high risk of a heart attack or heart disease within three to five years look I'm not a medical professional I don't know right but I just feel uncomfortable with someone who's not like testing Trump himself chiming in on this either you know what I mean look I'm gonna defend Trump on that one too first of all damage Jim I'm not a doctor I'm a talk show host and so of course I don't know what a score of 133 means I read it I understood what Sanjay Gupta's saying but it's just it seems sensationalistic to call it heart disease it makes it sound like he's gonna have a heart attack any second and his doctor says no they did coronary test on him and he's fine so and you could argue over that particular number but so what I mean even if he was at risk for heart disease and yeah right point it just it's just irrelevant in that sense and then also people who kept posting pictures comparing Trump to athletes who happen to weigh more so we have a few examples of that let's go to graphic 45 I just I mean I yeah anyway look look it's we don't know I don't know I let's just keep looking at these pictures okay yeah yeah muscle weighs more than fat these are not the best ways of determining whether or not he's lying about his weight and III don't care so let's move on with our lives okay but I'm gonna say one last thing again once the conspiracy start they they're like big catch on waffles you see those pictures they even got to me I was like wait a minute there's no way that guy's 239 and that guy's 239 and then Johnny pie got me yeah I think he's like he's like just know weighs 230 okay and then apparently another part of theory is that he got the the kind of test ahead of time that they insisted on taking it because it's out there in public and they had him study for it okay if that's true that's so wonderfully prophetic but ya know but that's that didn't happen okay we don't know no fake this actually might be literally fake news okay anyway but so my bottom line on all this is Trump today he's bragging about the 30 out of 30 that doesn't test how intelligent you are it's not an IQ test it tests whether you have dementia yeah that is the lower bar ever we have an idiot president going around hey hey I don't have dementia aren't I so smart look at me my people Jean I'm not mentally deficient well that goes to show that perhaps you're not that bright if your bar is I don't have dementia and I'm proud you just watch the video by The Young Turks the home of the revolution if you'd like to get the full
