>> Melissa: WE WANT TO BRING
YOU A FOX NEWS ALERT RIGHT NOW
ON THE SITUATION WITH
ATTORNEY GENERAL ROD ROSENSTEIN
IN THE NEWS THAT HAS BEEN AROUND
IN THE NEWS THAT HAS BEEN AROUND
HIM ALL MORNING NOW AND THIS
IDEA THAT HE WENT TO THE
WHITE HOUSE TO POTENTIALLY
EITHER TENDER HIS RESIGNATION OR
EITHER TENDER HIS RESIGNATION OR
BE FIRED.
THIS IS FROM SARAH SANDERS RIGHT
THIS IS FROM SARAH SANDERS RIGHT
NOW.
AT THE REQUEST OF DEPUTY
ATTORNEY GENERAL ROD ROSENSTEIN,
ATTORNEY GENERAL ROD ROSENSTEIN,
HE AND PRESIDENT TRUMP HAVE HAD
AN EXTENDED CONVERSATION TO
DISCUSS THE RECENT NEWS STORY
BECAUSE THE PRESIDENT IS AT THE
UNITED NATIONS GENERAL ASSEMBLY
AND HAD FULL SCHEDULED LEADERS
FROM AROUND THE WORLD, THEY WILL
FROM AROUND THE WORLD, THEY WILL
MEET ON THURSDAY WHEN THE
PRESIDENT RETURNS TO
WASHINGTON, D.C., THURSDAY.
>> Kennedy: HOW WE ARE, THAT
PLAYS INTO MY THEORY THAT THIS
IS ALL TO GET KAVANAUGH OFF OF
THE FRONT PAGE.
THURSDAY IS A DUAL TESTIMONY
BETWEEN DR. CHRISTINE FORD AND
JUDGE BRETT KAVANAUGH WHERE
THEY’RE BOTH GOING TO GO BEFORE
THE SENATE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE,
SHALL GO FIRST AND HE’LL GO
SECOND.
WILL PUBLICLY MAKE THOSE ON THE
MAKE ACCUSATIONS UNDER OATH THAT
MAKE ACCUSATIONS UNDER OATH THAT
HE WILL ANSWER TO THEM.
THIS IS A VERY DRAMATIC DAY,
INCREDIBLY PIVOTAL NOT ONLY FOR
THE SUPREME COURT BUT FOR JUDGE
BRETT KAVANAUGH’S FUTURE CAREER
AS A JURIST AND IF THIS IS
HAPPENING, IF ROD ROSENSTEIN
MIGHT RESIGN, MAKE IT FIRED ON
THURSDAY, JUST TAKES SOME OF
THESE AWAY.
>> Christopher: WAS IN THE
NEWS THAT HE HAD ALREADY BEEN
FIRED OR RESIGNED?
EITHER WAY, WAS KIND OF
UNDERCUTS A LOT OF THE REPORTING
UNDERCUTS A LOT OF THE REPORTING
AND I WONDER HOW MANY SOURCES
WERE ACTUALLY INVOLVED IN THIS
REPORTING PERIOD >> Harris:
THAT IS A JOURNALISM THAT I’M
TALKING ABOUT.
TO FIGURE OUT WHO KNEW WHAT AND
FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE WATCHING
FOX NEWS, KIND OF REPORTING IT
AS IT’S HAPPENING BUT WE ARE
TALKING ABOUT THE POSSIBILITIES
BECAUSE OF THE ARTICLE THAT’S
COME OUT, BECAUSE OF THE
CONFLICTS OF INTERESTS THAT ARE
REPORTING SHOWED.
BUT YOU DID HAVE SOME THAT HAVE
JUMPED THE SHARK SO FAR.
>> Christopher: IS NOT A GOOD
LOOK FOR REPORTERS AND I DON’T
THINK JONATHAN SWANN DOES IS BUT
THINK JONATHAN SWANN DOES IS BUT
FOR A LOT OF THEM, THE BAR IS
ETHICS HERE, RESISTANCE HERE,
AND THEY’RE GOING TO BE ABLE TO
WRITE HISTORY CLASSES ON THIS IN
WRITE HISTORY CLASSES ON THIS IN
THE FUTURE AND HOW JOURNALISM
CHANGED UNDER TRUMP AND IF IT
CAN NEVER COME BACK.
>> Harris: AGAIN, ALWAYS A
POSSIBILITY THAT THEY TALK TODAY
POSSIBILITY THAT THEY TALK TODAY
AND SOMETHING COMES AFTER.
>> Jessica: THAT’S WHAT I
THOUGHT WAS GOING TO HAPPEN.
JONATHAN SWAN HAS BEEN GREAT AND
JONATHAN SWAN HAS BEEN GREAT AND
A LOT OF THINGS SO I DON’T THINK
A LOT OF THINGS SO I DON’T THINK
UNDERCUT HIM AS A REPORTER HERE
HAS BEEN QUITE CLEAR THAT CHIEF
OF STAFF JOHN KELLY IS QUITE
FOND OF HIM, SEEMS LIKE THAT’S
HIS LEAK.
I ACTUALLY THOUGHT THAT
ROSENSTEIN WOULD GO IN THERE AND
ROSENSTEIN WOULD GO IN THERE AND
TALK TO HIM AND REMAIN IN THE
JOB.
THAT IT WOULD BE A CLEARING OF
THE AIR BECAUSE I THINK THE
PRESIDENT HAS BEEN INSTRUCTED
ENOUGH TIMES THAT FIRING JEFF
SESSIONS OR ROD ROSENSTEIN IS
INCREDIBLY BAD FOR MIDTERM
PROCESS AND IN NOVEMBER, THERE
WILL BE A FULL REEVALUATION.
>> Melissa: THAT COULD EXACTLY
BE WHY WE SAW THAT LEAKED TO
"THE NEW YORK TIMES" AT THE
PRESIDENT KNOWS IT WOULD BE
UNWISE TO FIRE HIM AHEAD OF THE
MIDTERMS AND THERE ARE THOSE
AGAINST THE PRESIDENT WHO ARE
LEAKING TO "THE NEW YORK TIMES"
AND TRYING TO GOAD HIM INTO
DOING IT THE SAME WAY.
>> Kennedy: SPEAKING OF LEAKS,
IF YOU HAVE FOUR DIFFERENT
STORIES CIRCULATING WITHIN THE
WHITE HOUSE AND YOU SEE THEM IN
FOUR DIFFERENT PLACES, YOU CAN
THEN SEE WHO WAS A SOURCE FOR
WHICH PUBLICATION AND THIS MAY
