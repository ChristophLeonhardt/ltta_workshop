Twitter and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I just sat in disbelief and</font>

13
00:00:23,730 --> 00:00:26,580
then it was already like what Z blue<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

14
00:00:26,580 --> 00:00:28,199
log on to facebook like wednesday night

15
00:00:28,199 --> 00:00:31,019
and there is lavish Reynolds like

16
00:00:31,019 --> 00:00:33,120
holding all her composure together as

17
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:35,969
her boyfriend is like gasping his last

18
00:00:35,969 --> 00:00:37,829
breast with her four-year-old child in

19
00:00:37,829 --> 00:00:39,149
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> backseat and then</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this police</font>

20
00:00:39,149 --> 00:00:40,950
officer with<font color="#E5E5E5"> the gun through still</font>

21
00:00:40,950 --> 00:00:42,989
through the window yelling explicit us

22
00:00:42,989 --> 00:00:46,680
at them and I really just felt so so we

23
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:49,739
are talking<font color="#E5E5E5"> about the police brutality</font>

24
00:00:49,739 --> 00:00:50,879
and what you should<font color="#CCCCCC"> really be calling</font>

25
00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:53,010
extrajudicial killings<font color="#CCCCCC"> extra-judicial</font>

26
00:00:53,010 --> 00:00:56,039
killings<font color="#E5E5E5"> just realizing how much more</font>

27
00:00:56,039 --> 00:00:57,930
black people are look so negatively upon

28
00:00:57,930 --> 00:01:00,690
because when lavish was like the cop was

29
00:01:00,690 --> 00:01:02,010
like yelling at her and she said no

30
00:01:02,010 --> 00:01:04,199
worries<font color="#E5E5E5"> sir you know when I say no</font>

31
00:01:04,199 --> 00:01:06,299
worries I say no<font color="#E5E5E5"> worries because I don't</font>

32
00:01:06,299 --> 00:01:07,290
<font color="#CCCCCC">want you to perceive me in a certain way</font>

33
00:01:07,290 --> 00:01:08,729
I'm not<font color="#CCCCCC"> going to be a sassy black I'm</font>

34
00:01:08,729 --> 00:01:10,140
<font color="#CCCCCC">not having any</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of your stereotype any of</font>

35
00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:11,369
her negative pejoratives against black

36
00:01:11,369 --> 00:01:12,840
women I'm not trying<font color="#CCCCCC"> to let you have any</font>

37
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:14,220
of those and in a moment when her

38
00:01:14,220 --> 00:01:16,229
boyfriend is like dying she says no

39
00:01:16,229 --> 00:01:17,580
worries because she knows where this

40
00:01:17,580 --> 00:01:19,290
video is going<font color="#E5E5E5"> and she knows how people</font>

41
00:01:19,290 --> 00:01:21,360
will tear her apart because they are

42
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:24,830
gonna perceive her as a poor black woman

43
00:01:24,830 --> 00:01:26,700
emotionally it was<font color="#E5E5E5"> already super heavy</font>

44
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:27,900
for me it's like y'all I'm trying to

45
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:29,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">change how I perceive the world how I</font>

46
00:01:29,430 --> 00:01:31,290
proceed people I'm gonna change how we

47
00:01:31,290 --> 00:01:32,850
are perceived I go to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> black lives</font>

48
00:01:32,850 --> 00:01:33,990
matter march because i live in downtown

<font color="#CCCCCC">Dallas and I felt like maybe somebody</font>

50
00:01:36,630 --> 00:01:37,560
had like a better way of articulating

51
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:39,509
inter had the magical answer and I was

52
00:01:39,509 --> 00:01:41,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">feeling so helpless and so I walked I</font>

53
00:01:41,850 --> 00:01:44,009
walk<font color="#CCCCCC"> to Bell Park and I went</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to the</font>

54
00:01:44,009 --> 00:01:45,329
black lives matter campaign I just

55
00:01:45,329 --> 00:01:46,920
embraced how beautiful what to see all

56
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:48,509

57
00:01:48,509 --> 00:01:50,280

<font color="#E5E5E5">that was shooting how beautifully sad</font>

61
00:01:55,079 --> 00:01:56,610
that was and then I understand that I'm

00:01:56,610 --> 00:01:57,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">gonna have to commit a part of my life</font>

63
00:01:57,960 --> 00:02:00,540
in order to find this change that some

64
00:02:00,540 --> 00:02:01,439
people are gonna sit at home and

65
00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:03,540
criticize over like I was already hurt

66
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:05,579

the respectability politics<font color="#E5E5E5"> about how</font>

74
00:02:16,450 --> 00:02:18,370
many black people were taking this

75
00:02:18,370 --> 00:02:20,860
opportunity to to further cash trade us

76
00:02:20,860 --> 00:02:22,510

become the<font color="#E5E5E5"> perfect victim and of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> course</font>

millennial narcissistic and yes if I was

118
00:03:44,850 --> 00:03:48,310
experiencing a mass shooting like a

119
00:03:48,310 --> 00:03:51,610
moment in American history I am right

120
00:03:51,610 --> 00:03:56,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">here right now experiencing it</font>

121
00:04:00,790 --> 00:04:04,840
I still<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't know how to process it in</font>

122
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:06,700
one moment we were having a peaceful

123
00:04:06,700 --> 00:04:09,670
protest<font color="#CCCCCC"> I felt some of the helplessness</font>

124
00:04:09,670 --> 00:04:12,129
like kind of sift away I<font color="#CCCCCC"> felt like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I had</font>

125
00:04:12,129 --> 00:04:15,570
a very very small piece of Silas and

126
00:04:15,570 --> 00:04:18,160
five police officers are<font color="#E5E5E5"> now dead the</font>

127
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:21,728
idea that somebody could easily access

128
00:04:21,728 --> 00:04:25,060
that many guns stockpile and plan<font color="#CCCCCC"> he and</font>

129
00:04:25,060 --> 00:04:26,860
even the police<font color="#E5E5E5"> who are armed and</font>

130
00:04:26,860 --> 00:04:28,840
trained to stop the bad guy could not

131
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:32,350
stop this sniper or this attack they

132
00:04:32,350 --> 00:04:34,750
couldn't stop it like think<font color="#CCCCCC"> about that</font>

133
00:04:34,750 --> 00:04:36,669
part<font color="#E5E5E5"> of what's really sad for me is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

134
00:04:36,669 --> 00:04:38,139
people are now going to use this as a

135
00:04:38,139 --> 00:04:41,500
reason to not participate in protest

136
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:43,660
this amplifies the criticism that comes

137
00:04:43,660 --> 00:04:46,539
to people that like to benefit from<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

138
00:04:46,539 --> 00:04:47,620
sacrifice we don't want to participate

139
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:49,449
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the sacrifice and on the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> flip side</font>

140
00:04:49,449 --> 00:04:53,680
I'm already<font color="#E5E5E5"> mourning the idea that has</font>

141
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:55,479
black people we<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't have a right to</font>

142
00:04:55,479 --> 00:04:57,759
just be humans and to live and now I

143
00:04:57,759 --> 00:04:59,710
feel<font color="#E5E5E5"> like I have to exert extra humility</font>

144
00:04:59,710 --> 00:05:01,840
to show proof of my morning for the

145
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:03,460
police<font color="#E5E5E5"> who lost their life like why is</font>

146
00:05:03,460 --> 00:05:06,010
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> my duty when nobody even mourns the</font>

147
00:05:06,010 --> 00:05:08,139
passing of my people I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> looking at</font>

negative stereotypes in justifying this
