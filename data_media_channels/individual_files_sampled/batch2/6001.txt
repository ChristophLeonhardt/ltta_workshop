that has begun to catch on in America now which I love I'm also going to tell you about something that happened in Massachusetts related a wolf pack that I think you will that is super inspirational okay so first this is this this is the website that you can go to to donate for the for the wedding registry obviously that goes to wolf pack to fight to get money out of politics wolf dash pack.com slash wedding if you don't remember it's let me show you the pictures it's Rebecca Chan and Justin Hayashi who did this wonderful act of what we're calling the red white and blue wedding man that looks lovely god bless their hearts those are real Americans right there and and so then we said you know what guys why don't we go further here and actually encourage others to do it and we said email and if you'd like to do it more together at wolf dash pack.com and guess what people did they started emailing in and going you know what I'm gonna do the same thing I love this country and I love you guys so together at wolf dash pack.com if you want to participate and if you're doing it by the way you can do hashtag Wolfpack wedding and so now let me show you and more people that have begun to do it so here is Ryan and Amanda metropoliz and they said we're getting married we're gonna put it in our wedding registry wolf dash pack.com slash wedding okay and then Gabby and Andrew from Boston they're doing it and then skip from Washington said hey you know what I'm not getting married I'm 50/50 brother well you know what I'm about to have a 50th birthday I want people to give to Wolf Pack instead of and by the way you're also can give some other presents too we were getting married as well but wolf dash pack.com slash wedding even if your doing birthdays or anything else along those lines there are patriots in america they want to get the money out and and you do through small donors and and that's exactly what wolf packs doing and so you know we're fighting in all these different states and we've already got to pass in five states what we need is 34 states to call for a convention so we can get that amendment go around Congress so we don't need Congress okay so now we're fighting in Massachusetts that's the state we don't have yet but I think we will and they decided they were gonna have a committee here hearing first of all you've credit to the Wolfpack sponsor representative Carmen Gentilly who's testified there bless his heart there's a lot of great Americans I want to give credit to they're also chair the committee representative John Mahoney he was a Wolfpack co-sponsor I guess what happened people started showing up and all of a sudden there was 60 people in a committee hearing when normally committee hearings are not really lighting the place up right and so I you know there's some folks testifying there that you could see and then one of the folks that were testifying was Matt Missoula he is our organizing director in Massachusetts he's not a politician he's had a lot of lobbyists he's Matt Missoula from Massachusetts and he went and guess what happened all the representatives heard from him that's how democracy is supposed to work I know it's amazing what it does and it n it almost never does on the national level but at the state level a guy who actually cares and says hey you know what if we have private financing of Elections they will work for private interests why don't we do something else why don't we do election reform why don't we get the money out and they're like all right Matt gonna step up to the plate and he did and then they did a fund meet up afterwards in in Boston after the committee hearing 40 showed up from our side and then there was another group we the people Massachusetts that had another 20 folks show up and then a a wall went had to drink together but mainly I want to tell you about this next person that's Erika Gore's there she is and Erika has great anxiety she has epilepsy so she was great anxiety and it was it makes her hard to participate with the team but she cares so much about this issue so she wanted to testify in a public hearing takes tremendous courage and she wound up collapsing in front of the whole crowd you know what she did afterwards she got up she got up and testified and said I want to get the money out because I'm afraid the insurance companies are gonna control the legislators and if I lose my insurance I could die I don't want that I want you guys to represent me the voters the public not the people financing the elections it's people like that like Erica that are gonna save this country and all the people who are doing weddings birthdays the center so bless her heart and you know you get these inspirational stories every once a while and I'm amazed by him where's the woman in New York who had a broken back and was making calls from her hospital bed there was the person who again had incredible shyness but had gathered up the girl courage for the first time to go and speak to legislators there's somebody who was disabled and they couldn't get out so they said all right well then I'm gonna make more phone calls than anybody's ever made for a wolf pack in North Carolina so join us join us wolf dash pack.com slash States and that's how you volunteer you find out you know how you can help in your own state whether it's Massachusetts that's happening right now whether it's states like New Mexico and Hawaii that we're so close last year New Hampshire there's so many of these states where we're on the edge well it is truly non partisan we're getting a lot of Republicans to vote with us as well they don't like crony capitalism they know that they need election reform 93% of the country agrees that means a whole ton of Republicans and Democrats and libertarians and liberals and moderates everyone they say that unfortunately right now the politicians represent the donors and not the voters and we've got to change that if we got to bring our democracy back so for this particular campaign we're trying to get to a hundred thousand dollars so that Wolfpack can launch the next mission and tell you about that mission and that mission is gonna be super exciting and it's gonna involve really going after some people and making sure that their voice is heard and their power is used so wolf dash pack.com slash wedding it started as a red white and blue wedding for the people who are serving the big donors it might end up in just the red wedding let's see how that turns out but let's get them to $100,000
