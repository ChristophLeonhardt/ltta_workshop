1
00:00:01,290 --> 00:00:02,291
ROLE IN SUPPORTING THE TURKISH

2
00:00:02,291 --> 00:00:02,692
GOVERNMENT.

3
00:00:02,692 --> 00:00:04,694
THEY DID NOT RESPOND AS THEY

4
00:00:04,694 --> 00:00:07,129
HAVE NOT RESPONDED FOREARM AND A

5
00:00:07,129 --> 00:00:08,898
REQUEST, BUT WE ARE GOING TO

6
00:00:08,898 --> 00:00:09,699
KEEP TRYING.

7
00:00:09,699 --> 00:00:10,599
THE ACADEMY HAS LEANED LEFT FOR

8
00:00:10,599 --> 00:00:13,536
A LONG TIME BUT MANY SCHOOLS

9
00:00:13,536 --> 00:00:15,705
THAT TILT IS BECOMING

10
00:00:15,705 --> 00:00:16,439
MONOLITHIC, UTTERLY MONOLITHIC.

11
00:00:16,439 --> 00:00:18,107
A NEW REPORT LOOKS AT THE

12
00:00:18,107 --> 00:00:19,909
FACULTY AT MORE THAN 50 TOP

13
00:00:19,909 --> 00:00:21,310
LIBERAL ARTS COLLEGES AND FOUND

14
00:00:21,310 --> 00:00:22,511
THAT IF THE SERVICE ACADEMIES

15
00:00:22,511 --> 00:00:25,247
ARE EXCLUDED, AIR FORCE, NAVY,

16
00:00:25,247 --> 00:00:27,717
ARMY, REGISTERED DEMOCRATS

17
00:00:27,717 --> 00:00:28,884
OUTNUMBER REGISTERED REPUBLICANS

18
00:00:28,884 --> 00:00:30,086
MORE THAN 12-1.

19
00:00:30,086 --> 00:00:32,320
MUCH MORE THAN THAT ON SOME

20
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:35,057
CAMPUSES.

21
00:00:35,057 --> 00:00:37,493
THIS LACK OF IDEOLOGICAL

22
00:00:37,493 --> 00:00:38,894
DIVERSITY IS BREEDING ARROGANCE

23
00:00:38,894 --> 00:00:41,497
AMONG OTHER THINGS, SAISON.

24
00:00:41,497 --> 00:00:43,032
GERARD ALEXANDER IS A POLITICAL

25
00:00:43,032 --> 00:00:44,533
SCIENCE WERE PRESSURE,

26
00:00:44,533 --> 00:00:45,501
PROFESSOR.

27
00:00:45,501 --> 00:00:46,435
HE WROTE A GREAT PIECE FOR

28
00:00:46,435 --> 00:00:48,370
"THE NEW YORK TIMES" OVER THE

29
00:00:48,370 --> 00:00:49,405
WEEKEND, MORNING LIBERALS WERE

30
00:00:49,405 --> 00:00:50,539
NOT AS SMART AS YOU THINK.

31
00:00:50,539 --> 00:00:51,607
THANKS FOR COMING ON.

32
00:00:51,607 --> 00:00:53,609
>> THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME.

33
00:00:53,609 --> 00:00:55,044
>> Tucker: SO WHAT DO YOU MEAN

34
00:00:55,044 --> 00:00:56,479
BY THAT, LIBERALS, YOU ARE NOT

35
00:00:56,479 --> 00:00:58,280
AS SMART AS YOU THINK YOU MIGHT

36
00:00:58,280 --> 00:00:59,682
>> AS EVERY WRITER KNOWS, THEY

37
00:00:59,682 --> 00:01:00,449
DON'T CHOOSE THEIR OWN TITLES

38
00:01:00,449 --> 00:01:02,718
AND I MIGHT HAVE PREFERRED

39
00:01:02,718 --> 00:01:05,688
SOMETHING A LITTLE LESS LIKE

40
00:01:05,688 --> 00:01:06,388
CLICKBAIT OR AGGRESSIVE AND I

41
00:01:06,388 --> 00:01:07,890
WAS TRYING TO COMMUNICATE TO

42
00:01:07,890 --> 00:01:09,191
LIBERALS, MANY OF WHOM I THINK

43
00:01:09,191 --> 00:01:11,494
MEAN WELL THE COUNTRY AND DON'T

44
00:01:11,494 --> 00:01:12,561
REALIZE THE EFFECTS THEY ARE

45
00:01:12,561 --> 00:01:16,732
HAVING THAT THEIR TONE, THEIR

46
00:01:16,732 --> 00:01:17,900
APPROACH TO A LOT OF OUR

47
00:01:17,900 --> 00:01:18,601
NATIONAL CONVERSATIONS ABOUT A

48
00:01:18,601 --> 00:01:21,103
WHOLE SLEW OF ISSUES, IT CAN

49
00:01:21,103 --> 00:01:23,172
ATTRACT AND PERSUADE PEOPLE

50
00:01:23,172 --> 00:01:28,010
GIVING A SPEECH FROM AN    FROMA

51
00:01:28,010 --> 00:01:29,345
STAGE, USING ALL KINDS OF THE

52
00:01:29,345 --> 00:01:31,480
PLATFORMS THEY HAVE AN AMERICAN

53
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:32,314
LIFE, THE PROMINENCE THEY HAVE

54
00:01:32,314 --> 00:01:33,182
AN AMERICAN LIFE, THERE ARE

55
00:01:33,182 --> 00:01:35,751
TIMES WHEN I CAN BE USED TO SET

56
00:01:35,751 --> 00:01:37,520
AN EXAMPLE TO EDUCATE, TO

57
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:38,721
ATTRACT, TO LEND CELEBRITY AND

58
00:01:38,721 --> 00:01:40,356
CREDIBILITY TO POINTS OF VIEW,

59
00:01:40,356 --> 00:01:41,590
BUT IT'S DISTRESSING TO ME HOW

60
00:01:41,590 --> 00:01:43,826
OFTEN THOSE PLATFORMS END UP

61
00:01:43,826 --> 00:01:45,828
BEING USED IN WAYS THAT

62
00:01:45,828 --> 00:01:46,562
COMMUNICATE SELF-RIGHTEOUSNESS,

63
00:01:46,562 --> 00:01:51,133
A TONE OF INTELLECTUAL AND MORAL

64
00:01:51,133 --> 00:01:51,534
SUPERIORITY.

65
00:01:51,534 --> 00:01:53,102
HOW OFTEN THEY ARE USED TO BE

66
00:01:53,102 --> 00:01:54,904
RATE INSTEAD OF PERSUADE AND I

67
00:01:54,904 --> 00:01:55,671
THINK ONE OF THE EFFECTS

68
00:01:55,671 --> 00:01:56,405
LIBERALS DON'T REALIZE THEY ARE

69
00:01:56,405 --> 00:01:58,474
HAVING IS HOW MUCH THEY ARE

70
00:01:58,474 --> 00:01:59,942
ALIENATING OTHER PEOPLE.

71
00:01:59,942 --> 00:02:00,776
I THINK IT'S ALMOST ENTIRELY

72
00:02:00,776 --> 00:02:02,444
INADVERTENT AND I THINK IT'S ONE

73
00:02:02,444 --> 00:02:04,380
OF MANY TRENDS IN AMERICAN LIFE

74
00:02:04,380 --> 00:02:05,281
THAT'S REALLY UNHELPFUL THAT WE

75
00:02:05,281 --> 00:02:07,349
COULD BETTER AVOID AND I TRY TO

76
00:02:07,349 --> 00:02:09,551
GIVE ANY ARTICLE AN IDEA OF WAYS

77
00:02:09,551 --> 00:02:11,520
THEY MIGHT TRY TO AVOID DOING

78
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:12,688
THAT.

79
00:02:12,688 --> 00:02:13,322
>> Tucker: DIVERSITY WAS

80
00:02:13,322 --> 00:02:14,690
SUPPOSED TO BE THE GUARD RAIL

81
00:02:14,690 --> 00:02:15,891
THAT PREVENTED PEOPLE FROM GOING

82
00:02:15,891 --> 00:02:17,960
OFF ENTER SELF-RIGHTEOUSNESS AND

83
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:20,496
LACK OF SELF-AWARENESS.

84
00:02:20,496 --> 00:02:21,564
HAVING PEOPLE AROUND WHO

85
00:02:21,564 --> 00:02:23,199
DISAGREE WITH YOU AND BRING

86
00:02:23,199 --> 00:02:23,966
DIFFERENT LIFE EXPERIENCES TO

87
00:02:23,966 --> 00:02:24,733
THE CONVERSATION WAS SUPPOSED TO

88
00:02:24,733 --> 00:02:26,335
BROADEN US.

89
00:02:26,335 --> 00:02:28,204
IF IN MOST UNIVERSITIES THERE IS

90
00:02:28,204 --> 00:02:29,138
NOBODY WHO DOESN'T AGREE WITH

91
00:02:29,138 --> 00:02:30,806
YOU, YOU NEVER MEET ANYBODY WITH

92
00:02:30,806 --> 00:02:32,875
A DIFFERENT VIEW, WHY WOULDN'T

93
00:02:32,875 --> 00:02:33,609
YOU BECOME ARROGANT AND DUMB

94
00:02:33,609 --> 00:02:36,679
OVER TIME AS THEY HAVE?

95
00:02:36,679 --> 00:02:37,613
>> IT'S A SERIOUS PROBLEM.

96
00:02:37,613 --> 00:02:40,649
LIBERALS HAVE BEEN SUCH GREAT

97
00:02:40,649 --> 00:02:41,917
FORCES IN MODERN AMERICAN LIFE

98
00:02:41,917 --> 00:02:42,618
OR BRINGING CERTAIN KINDS OF

99
00:02:42,618 --> 00:02:45,287
DIVERSITY TO THE TABLE AND BEING

100
00:02:45,287 --> 00:02:47,122
ENTHUSIASTIC ABOUT THAT.

101
00:02:47,122 --> 00:02:50,092
WHO DOESN'T THINK AMERICA HAS

102
00:02:50,092 --> 00:02:51,293
BENEFITED FROM MORE

103
00:02:51,293 --> 00:02:52,328
AFRICAN-AMERICAN FACES, MORE

104
00:02:52,328 --> 00:02:54,563
HISPANIC VOICES, MORE WOMEN IN

105
00:02:54,563 --> 00:02:56,298
PROMINENT POSITIONS, AMERICA HAS

106
00:02:56,298 --> 00:02:57,066
BEEN OFFENDED INTELLECTUALLY AND

107
00:02:57,066 --> 00:02:57,900
OTHERWISE FROM THAT BUT THEY

108
00:02:57,900 --> 00:02:59,602
REALLY HAVE HAD A BLIND SPOT

109
00:02:59,602 --> 00:03:00,669
WHEN IT COMES TO WHAT SOME

110
00:03:00,669 --> 00:03:01,904
PEOPLE I ADMIRE GREATLY HAVE

111
00:03:01,904 --> 00:03:04,473
STARTED CALLING VIEWPOINT

112
00:03:04,473 --> 00:03:06,709
DIVERSITY, MAY BE BETTER THAN

113
00:03:06,709 --> 00:03:07,309
IDEOLOGICAL DIVERSITY.

114
00:03:07,309 --> 00:03:07,943
>> Tucker: WAIT A SECOND,

115
00:03:07,943 --> 00:03:10,346
WHAT'S THE POINT OF ETHNIC OR

116
00:03:10,346 --> 00:03:12,314
GENDER DIVERSITY IF NOT TO BRING

117
00:03:12,314 --> 00:03:12,848
VIEWPOINT DIVERSITY?

118
00:03:12,848 --> 00:03:15,084
I THOUGHT THAT WAS THE POINT.

119
00:03:15,084 --> 00:03:17,887
HOW CAN -- IN OTHER WORDS, IF

120
00:03:17,887 --> 00:03:19,121
YOU HAVE A GROUP OF PEOPLE WHO

121
00:03:19,121 --> 00:03:19,889
ALL LOOKED DIFFERENT BUT COME

122
00:03:19,889 --> 00:03:21,290
FROM THE SAME CULTURE AND HAVE

123
00:03:21,290 --> 00:03:23,692
THE SAME VIEWS, HOW WAS THAT IN

124
00:03:23,692 --> 00:03:24,293
ANY SENSE DIVERSE?

125
00:03:24,293 --> 00:03:25,527
>> ORIGINALLY THEY DIDN'T COME

126
00:03:25,527 --> 00:03:26,929
FROM THE SAME VIEWPOINTS.

127
00:03:26,929 --> 00:03:28,364
PEOPLE WHO CAME FROM THE

128
00:03:28,364 --> 00:03:30,299
JIM CROW SOUTH HAD VERY

129
00:03:30,299 --> 00:03:31,400
DIFFERENT LIFE EXPERIENCES THAN

130
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:32,334
UPPER-MIDDLE-CLASS NORTHERNERS.

131
00:03:32,334 --> 00:03:34,670
BUT INCREASINGLY WHAT HAS

132
00:03:34,670 --> 00:03:35,371
HAPPENED, ESPECIALLY THROUGH

133
00:03:35,371 --> 00:03:39,541
AMERICAN UNIVERSITIES IS A TREND

134
00:03:39,541 --> 00:03:41,143
TOWARDS GENDER AND ETHNIC

135
00:03:41,143 --> 00:03:42,611
DIVERSITY, RACIAL DIVERSITY, BUT

136
00:03:42,611 --> 00:03:43,779
NOT INTELLECTUAL DIVERSITY.

137
00:03:43,779 --> 00:03:45,414
I THINK THAT HAS BEEN REALLY

138
00:03:45,414 --> 00:03:46,782
COSTLY AND JUST SOME OF THE WAYS

139
00:03:46,782 --> 00:03:47,683
YOU ARE SUGGESTING.

140
00:03:47,683 --> 00:03:50,753
IT BREEDS, AMONG OTHER THINGS,

141
00:03:50,753 --> 00:03:51,353
INCREDIBLE INTELLECTUAL

142
00:03:51,353 --> 00:03:54,256
COMPLACENCY AND I THINK THAT IN

143
00:03:54,256 --> 00:03:56,091
A SENSE, VIEWPOINTS THAT

144
00:03:56,091 --> 00:03:56,892
CONSERVATIVES MIGHT BOYS COME

145
00:03:56,892 --> 00:03:57,893
UNDER TREMENDOUS CRITICAL

146
00:03:57,893 --> 00:04:00,829
SCRUTINY, ARE REALLY A QUESTION

147
00:04:00,829 --> 00:04:02,898
OR REALLY RAKED OVER THE COALS

148
00:04:02,898 --> 00:04:04,867
AND OFTEN PRESUMPTIVELY REJECTED

149
00:04:04,867 --> 00:04:05,634
AS ILLEGITIMATE OR UNPERSUASIVE.

150
00:04:05,634 --> 00:04:07,736
WHEREAS A LOT OF ASSUMPTIONS

151
00:04:07,736 --> 00:04:09,538
HELD BY PEOPLE IN THE AMERICAN

152
00:04:09,538 --> 00:04:12,908
LEFT GO UNEXAMINED FOR LONG

153
00:04:12,908 --> 00:04:13,275
PERIODS.

154
00:04:13,275 --> 00:04:14,910
THAT'S THE KIND OF INTELLECTUAL

155
00:04:14,910 --> 00:04:16,411
ENVIRONMENT IN WHICH ERROR CAN

156
00:04:16,411 --> 00:04:18,380
THRIVE, IN WHICH ORTHODOXIES CAN

157
00:04:18,380 --> 00:04:21,283
GEL AND IN WHICH, YOU ARE RIGHT,

158
00:04:21,283 --> 00:04:22,551
IN WHICH VIEWPOINTS CAN BE,

159
00:04:22,551 --> 00:04:24,553
INSTEAD OF DIVERSE, THEY CAN END

160
00:04:24,553 --> 00:04:25,321
UP BECOMING HOMOGENIZED.

161
00:04:25,321 --> 00:04:26,622
THERE'S A REAL DANGER THAT

162
00:04:26,622 --> 00:04:27,289
THAT'S WHAT'S HAPPENING.

163
00:04:27,289 --> 00:04:28,057
NOT IN THE SENSE THAT ALL PEOPLE

164
00:04:28,057 --> 00:04:29,325
IN THE LEFT AGREE WITH EACH

165
00:04:29,325 --> 00:04:31,226
OTHER BECAUSE OUR CAMPUSES THEY

166
00:04:31,226 --> 00:04:31,527
DON'T.

167
00:04:31,527 --> 00:04:34,330
ANY ACADEMIC KNOWS THAT.

168
00:04:34,330 --> 00:04:35,331
BUT ORTHODOXY AND HOMOGENEITY IN

169
00:04:35,331 --> 00:04:37,132
THE SENSE THAT THEY STOP

170
00:04:37,132 --> 00:04:37,900
REFLECTING THE TRUE DIVERSITY

171
00:04:37,900 --> 00:04:38,667
INTELLECTUALLY OF THE WHOLE

172
00:04:38,667 --> 00:04:40,202
COUNTRY.

173
00:04:40,336 --> 00:04:42,304
>> Tucker: NICELY PUT.

174
00:04:42,304 --> 00:00:00,000
I'M GLAD THAT YOU ARE IN THAT
