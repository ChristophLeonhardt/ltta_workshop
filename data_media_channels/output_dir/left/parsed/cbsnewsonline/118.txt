COUNCIL ARE UNITED ON THE FINAL 
DENUCLEARIZATION OF NORTH KOREA 
AS AGREED TO BY KIM JONG-UN. 
NEGOTIATIONS ARE CRITICAL TO 
ACHIEVING THIS GOAL, MEMBERS OF 
THE UN SECURITY COUNCIL, AND 
MEMBER STATES, HAVE UNANIMOUSLY 
AGREED TO FULLY ENFORCE 
SANCTIONS ON NORTH KOREA, WE 
EXPECT THEM TO CONTINUE TO 
HONOR THOSE COMMITMENTS. 
WHEN SANCTIONS ARE NOT IN 
FORCE, THE PROSPECTS FOR THE 
SUCCESSFUL DENUCLEARIZATION OF 
NORTH KOREA ARE DIMINISHED. 
RIGHT NOW, NORTH KOREA IS 
ILLEGALLY SMUGGLING PETROLEUM 
PRODUCTS AT A LEVEL THAT FAR 
EXCEEDS THE QUOTA ESTABLISHD 
BY THE UNITED NATIONS. 
THESE ILLEGAL SHIP TO SHIP 
TRANSFERS ARE THE MOST 
ROMINENT MEANS BY WHICH THIS 
IS HAPPENING 
THEY HAPPENED AT LEAST 89 TIMES 
IN THE FIRST FIVE MONTHS OF 
THIS YEAR, AND THEY CONTINUE TO 
OCCUR. 
THE UNITED STATES REMINDS EVERY 
UN MEMBER STATE OF ITS 
RESPONSIBILITY TO STOP ILLEGAL 
SHIP TO SHIP TRANSFERS, AND WE 
URGE THEM TO STEP UP THEIR 
ENFORCEMENT EFFORTS AS WELL. 
WE MUST ALSO CRACKDOWN ANOTHER 
SANCTIONS, SMUGGLING OF COAL BY 
SEA, OVER LAND BORDERS, AND THE 
PRESENCE OF NORTH KOREAN 
GUESTWORKERS IN CERTAIN 
COUNTRIES. 
NORTH KOREAN CYBER THEFTS, 
GENERATING SIGNIFICANT REVENUES 
FOR THE REGIME, THEY MUST BE 
STOPPED. 
PRESIDENT TRUMP REMAINS UPBEAT 
ABOUT THE PROSPECTS OF 
DENUCLEARIZATION OF NORTH KOREA.
SO DO I. AS PROGRESS IS 
HAPPENING. 
IT IS THE TRUMP 
ADMINISTRATION'S HOPE THAT ONE 
DAY, THE D PRK COULD BE IN OUR 
MIDST HERE IN THE UNITED 
NATIONS, NOT AS A PARIAH BUT AS 
A FRIEND, IMAGINE UN SECURITY 
COUNCIL MEETINGS WHERE DPRK  
NUCLEAR PROGRAMS WERE NOT THE 
AGENDA TIME AND TIME AGAIN. 
WE WILL BE ABLE TO FOCUS OUR 
ENERGY ON SO MANY PROBLEMS THAT 
FACE OUR WORLD, I BELIEVE THAT 
REALITY IS POSSIBLE, AND SO 
DOES PRESIDENT TRUMP, BUT IT 
WILL TAKE FULL ENFORCEMENT OF 
SANCTIONS TO GET THERE, IT WILL 
ALSO TAKE KIM JONG-UN FOLLOWING 
THROUGH ON HIS PERSONAL 
COMMITMENTS THAT HE MADE TO 
PRESIDENT TRUMP IN SINGAPORE. 
THE PATH AHEAD IS NOT EASY, IT 
WILL TAKE TIME, BUT OUR HOPE IS 
FOR A SAFER WORLD FOR ARLISS, 
AND A BRIGHTER FUTURE FOR NORTH 
KOREA, IS OUR OBJECTIVE, AND 
HOPE ENDURES.
>>> I AM VERY GRATEFUL TO 
SECRETARY MIKE POMPEO FOR 
COMING OUT AND MEETING WITH THE 
SECURITY COUNCIL TODAY, THIS IS 
WHAT WE KNOW. 
18 MONTHS AGO WHEN I CAME IN, 
OUR BIGGEST CONCERN WAS NORTH 
KOREA. 
EVERYONE WAS WONDERING WHEN THE 
NEW TEST WAS GOING TO HAPPEN, 
WHEN THE NEW THREAT WOULD OCCUR,
AND THE ENTIRE INTERNATIONAL 
COMMUNITY KNEW SOMETHING HAD TO 
HAPPEN. 
IT WAS A HERCULEAN TASK BY THE 
SECURITY COUNCIL TO PASS THREE 
MASSIVE SANCTIONS PACKAGES. 
GETTING RID OF ALL EXPORTS, 90% 
OF THEIR TRADE, 30% OF THEIR 
OIL, EXPELLING ALL LABOR 
WORKERS AND SCHEDULING THAT 
DOWN, MAKING SURE ALL JOINT 
VENTURES STOPPED. ALL OF THAT, 
COMBINED WITH THE INTERNATIONAL 
COMMUNITY COMING TOGETHER AND 
EXPELLING DIPLOMATS AND 
STALLING COMMUNICATION, AND 
WITH THE PRESIDENTS TOUGH 
STANCE, ALL OF THAT WAS REALLY 
THE COMBINATION THAT BROUGHT 
NORTH KOREA TO THE TABLE. 
NOW, NORTH KOREA AND THE U.S. 
HAVE STARTED TO HAVE TALKS, AS 
THOSE THINGS ARE HAPPENING, WE 
AND THE SECURITY COUNCIL AND 
THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY 
HAVE TO SUPPORT THOSE TALKS, 
THE BEST WAY WE CAN SUPPORT 
THOSE TALKS IS TO NOT LOOSEN 
THE SANCTIONS. 
WHAT WE HAVE BEEN SEEING IS, 
CERTAIN COUNTRIES WANTING TO DO 
WAIVERS, CERTAIN COUNTRIES 
SAYING LET'S LIFT SANCTIONS, 
CERTAIN COUNTRIES WANTING TO DO 
MORE. 
AND I APPRECIATE SECRETARY MIKE 
POMPEO COMING, AND WE 
APPRECIATE, WE CAN'T DO ONE 
THING UNTIL WE SEE NORTH KOREA 
RESPOND TO THEIR PROMISE TO 
DENUCLEARIZE, WE HAVE TO SEE 
SOME SORT OF ACTION, UNTIL THAT 
HAPPENS, THE SECURITY COUNCIL 
IS GOING TO HOLD TIGHT, THE 
INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY, WE ASK 
YOU TO HOLD TIGHT AS WE GO 
FORWARD. 
THE PROBLEM THAT WE ARE 
ENCOUNTERING IS THAT SOME OF 
OUR FRIENDS HAVE DECIDED THAT 
THEY WANT TO GO AROUND THE 
RULES. 
YOU SAW THAT THERE WERE 
VIOLATIONS OF THE OIL BAND, AS 
THE SECRETARY SAID, WE HAVE 
SEEN 89 TIMES WERE THAT HAS 
HAPPENED, WE HAVE PHOTOGRAPHIC 
PROOF OF SHIP TO SHIP TRANSFERS.
AND OUR FRIENDS, WHAT WE 
DECIDED WAS LET'S MAKE SURE 
THAT THIS STOPS. 
SO THE U.S. PUT A HALT TO ALL 
ADDITIONAL REFINED PETROLEUM ÃºS 
CHINA AND RUSSIA BLOCKED IT. 
NOW, FOR CHINA AND RUSSIA TO 
BLOCK IT, WHAT ARE THEY TELLING 
US? 
ARE THEY TELLING US THAT THEY 
WANT TO CONTINUE SUPPLYING THE 
SOIL? 
THEY CLAIM THAT THEY NEED MORE 
INFORMATION, WE DON'T NEED ANY 
MORE INFORMATION, THE SANCTIONS 
COMMITTEE HAS WHAT IT NEEDS, WE 
ALL KNOW WHAT IS GOING FORWARD, 
PUT PRESSURE ON CHINA AND 
RUSSIA TO ABIDE AND BE GOOD 
HELPERS THROUGH THIS SITUATION, 
AND HELP US CONTINUE WITH 
DENUCLEARIZATION, SO THIS WAS A 
DAY A VERY FRANK TALK BETWEEN 
THE SECRETARY, THE FOREIGN 
MINISTER OF SOUTH KOREA, OUR 
JAPANESE FRIENDS AS WELL, AS 
WELL AS THE SECURITY COUNCIL, 
TO SAY THAT IF WE WANT TO SEE 
SUCCESS, WE HAVE TO SEE A 
RESPONSE FROM KIM JONG-UN, AND 
CONTINUE TO HOLD THE LINE UNTIL 
THAT HAPPENS. 
A VERY SUCCESSFUL DAY, 
PROMISING THAT THE SECURITY 
COUNCIL HAS REMAINED UNITED AND 
CONTINUING TO PUT PRESSURE ON 
OUR MEMBERS TO NOT FALL THROUGH 
-- FALL THROUGH ON THAT PROCESS.
>> YOU MENTIONED THAT RUSSIA 
HAS NOT BEEN THAT HELPFUL IN 
REGARDS TO SANCTIONS 
ENFORCEMENT. 
DID THE PRESIDENT MENTION THAT 
IN HIS MEETING WITH NORTH KOREA 
-- WITH PRESIDENT PUTIN? 
IS RUSSIA RENEGING ON AN 
AGREEMENT THAT IT MADE WITH THE 
PRESIDENT? 
WHAT ELSE TO THE TWO PRESIDENTS 
AGREE TO -- WHAT ELSE DID THE 2 
PRESIDENTS AGREE TO WHEN THEY 
MET? 
>> THERE HAVE BEEN MANY PLACES 
WHERE THE RUSSIANS HAVE BEEN 
HELPFUL, THEY HAVE DONE MANY 
THINGS TO ENFORCE SANCTIONS, 
AND WE ARE DEEPLY APPRECIATIVE 
OF THAT. 
WHAT WE NEED NOW THOUGH, IS WE 
NEED TO CONTINUE THAT. 
THIS IS NOT AN AMERICAN DEMAND 
FOR THE NORTH KOREANS TO 
DENUCLEARIZE, IT IS THE WORLD'S 
DEMAND, SO WHERE WE FIND ISSUES 
WHERE ANY COUNTRY, WHETHER IT 
IS RUSSIA, OR SOMEONE ELSE NOT 
DOING THEIR PART TO ENFORCE IT, 
WE PROVIDE INFORMATION TO THEM, 
THE WORLD CAN SEE IT, WE WILL 
REQUEST THAT EVERY COUNTRY IN 
THE WORLD DO THEIR PART.
>> THERE WAS THIS QUESTION 
ABOUT RUSSIA, WHY IS IT A GOOD 
IDEA FOR THE PRESIDENT TO INVITE
VLADIMIR PUTIN TO THE WHITE 
HOUSE? 
WHAT DOES THE U.S. HAVE TO GAIN 
FROM THAT VISIT? 
>> I AM HAPPY THAT THE TWO 
LEADERS OF IMPORTANT COUNTRIES 
ARE CONTINUING TO MEET, IF IT 
TAKES PLACE IN WASHINGTON, IT 
IS ALL TO THE GOOD, THOSE 
CONVERSATIONS ARE INCREDIBLY 
IMPORTANT. 
WE HAVE OUR SENIOR LEADERS 
MEETING ACROSS THE WORLD, IT IS 
VALUABLE TO THE PEOPLE OF 
UNITD STATES OF AMERICA, THAT 
PRESIDENT PUTIN AND TRUMP 
CONTINUE TO ENGAGE IN DIALOGUE 
TO RESOLVE THE DIFFICULT ISSUES 
THAT ARE COUNTRIES FACE. 
I THINK THIS MAKES ENORMOUS 
SENSE, I AM HOPEFUL THE MEETING 
WILL TAKE PLACE THIS FALL.>> 
MR. SECRETARY, WHAT CONCRETE 
STEPS DO YOU NEED TO TAKE AN 
NORTH KOREA TO TAKE, TO SHOW 
THAT THEY ARE COMMITTED TO 
DENUCLEARIZATION. 
AND ON RUSSIA, THEY SAID THEY 
SENT A PROPOSAL TO WASHINGTON 
ABOUT THE RETURN OF MILLIONS OF 
SYRIAN REFUGEES, BASED ON AN 
AGREEMENT THAT WAS REACHED BY 
PRESIDENT PUTIN AND TRUMP, HAVE 
YOU SEEN THAT?>> I WILL TAKE 
THE SECOND ONE FIRST, LOTS OF 
DISCUSSION TAKING PLACE, A 
DISCUSSION BETWEEN PRESIDENT 
TRUMP AND PRESIDENT PUTIN ABOUT 
THE SYRIAN REFUGEE ISSUE, THE 
PRESIDENT SHARED WITH ME THE 
CONVERSATIONS THEY HAD, IT IS 
IMPORTANT TO THE WORLD THAT AT 
THE RIGHT TIME THROUGH A 
VOLUNTARY MECHANISM, THESE 
REFUGEES HAVE BEEN ABLE TO 
RETURN TO THEIR COUNTRY, WE ARE 
WORKING ON THIS PROBLEM, SO 
PRESIDENT PUTIN AND PRESIDENT 
TRUMP DID DISCUSS THAT, LOTS OF 
WORK TO IMPLEMENT THAT, UNITED 
STATES WAS TO BE PART OF 
ACHIEVING THAT RESOLUTION IN 
SYRIA. 
YOUR FIRST QUESTION WAS ABOUT 
WHAT WE NEED TO SEE, IT IS 
PRETTY STRAIGHTFORWARD. 
IT IS NOT MY DESCRIPTION OF 
WHAT NEEDS TO TAKE PLACE, 
CHAIRMAN KIM MADE A PROMISE, HE 
TOLD NOT ONLY PRESIDENT TRUMP, 
BUT PRESIDENT MOON, THAT HE WAS 
PREPARED TO DENUCLEARIZE. 
THE SCOPE AND SCALE IS AGREED 
TO, THE NORTH KOREANS 
UNDERSTAND WHAT THAT MEANS, 
THERE IS NO MISTAKE ABOUT WHAT 
THE SCOPE OF DENUCLEARIZATION 
LOOKS LIKE, WE NEED TO SEE 
CHAIRMAN KIM DO WHAT HE 
PROMISED THE WORLD HE WOULD DO. 
IT IS NOT FANCY, BUT IT IS THE 
TRUTH.
>> THANK YOU, EVERYONE.
>>> WE HAVE BEEN LISTENING TO 
SECRETARY OF STATE MIKE POMPEO 
AND NIKKI HALEY, THE AMBASSADOR 
TO THE UNITED NATIONS, THEY MET 
WITH THE SECURITY COUNCIL THIS 
MORNING, THE MAIN FOCUS WAS TO 
CONTINUE TO PUSH THE 
ENFORCEMENT OF SANCTIONS 
AGAINST NORTH KOREA, MIKE 
POMPEO SAYING THAT CHAIRMAN KIM 
NEEDS TO FOLLOW THROUGH WITH 
HIS PERSONAL COMMITMENT THAT HE 
MADE WITH DONALD TRUMP, THAT HE 
WOULD DENUCLEARIZE, THAT IS TO 
BE VERIFIED, BUT THERE SEEMS TO 
BE AN ISSUE OF THE VIOLATIONS 
OF THE SANCTIONS THAT NORTH 
KOREA IS ABLE TO PURCHASE 
PETROLEUM PRODUCTS, AND THEY 
WANT TO SORT OF REINFORCE THE 
IDEA THAT THIS IS AN ILLEGAL 
ACTIVITY, PUSHING AN EFFORT TO 
ENCOURAGE MEMBER STATES, NOT TO 
BREAK THE SANCTIONS, AND CHINA 
AND MORE IMPORTANTLY RUSSIA, 
BLOCKED THAT EFFORT. 
THE REASON IT IS IMPORTANT IS 
BECAUSE THE PRESIDENT HAS BEEN 
TWEETING HIS APPRECIATION, OF 
HOW MUCH WORK RUSSIA HAS DONE, 
AND HOW RUSSIA HAS HELPED SO 
MUCH WITH NORTH KOREA. 
SO IF THEY ARE HELPING, WHY ARE 
THEY BLOCKING AN EFFORT TO 
REINFORCE THE SANCTIONS, ONE OF 
THE MANY QUESTIONS TO BE 
ASKED.>>> FOR NOW, WE WILL TAKE 
A BIT OF A BREAK RIGHT NOW, WE 
WILL HAVE MORE NEWS TO COME, 
YOU ARE STREAMING CBSN.
