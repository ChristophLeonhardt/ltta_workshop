I'm here in Worcester Worcester was the place where the three-year-old boy was allegedly attacked with acid whilst he was out shopping with his mom and it's a story that's shocked people all over the UK I'm here to find out more about acid attacks in this acid capital of the world and find out a little bit more about what's really going on when Mark van dong and dad walked into the hospital he couldn't find his son he asked the doctor where he was up the rooms he'd just been looking in the doctor told him his son was in room 1 his dad couldn't believe it he'd already looked in there but didn't recognize his own child Mark had suffered 25% burns to his body because of the acid that was thrown at him he lost his left eye his left ear his left leg had to be amputated his skin had to be surgically removed because it was so damaged he was paralyzed from the neck down who's in agony from the itching and the acid had burnt away into his bones the man had no life at all in September Mark's girlfriend ex-girlfriend now ballina Wallace went out and she bought a one liter bottle of acid so a liter looks like this she removed the label and she reached out acid attacks online and the effects of acid attacks on the night of the 22nd of September mark van Dongen made the fateful decision to stay the night at her flat he awoke in the early hours of the morning and berlina Wallace was stood over him holding the acid and she threw it all over his face and his body she was screaming if I can't have you no one else will faced with the prospect of losing his voice as well mark could no longer endure the psychological and physical torture of his condition he went to Belgium and he ended his own life with the help of euthanasia doctors the euthanasia doctors said they had never known someone be able to endure a life of such torture and pain one of the things about this acid that can be bought in these stores and makes you realize that as knives and guns are harder to get hold of this becomes a natural weapon of choice also if you get caught after you've thrown it you haven't got it on you and a female point of view if you use this it doesn't involve actual blunt trauma or force so you can see why this becomes a weapon that's widely used in the UK so in order to make acid a bit harder to get hold of the government have introduced regulations like you have to have ID if you're going to buy acid online at many stores actually have removed acid from sale and stores also won't sell to anybody if you haven't got proof of ID but despite this and despite the government introducing an offensive weapons bill it remains remarkably easy to get your hands on acid so I've just googled how to buy acid online and after I've sifted through the kind of drugs ordering that you can also do online I could get some LSD fairly simply if I wanted it I could order assets online right here I can choose sulfuric acid this is sulfuric acid at 98 percent concentrates I can simply add that to my cart a final total of what I'll be charged this is for 1 liter of sulfuric acid at 98 percent I'm gonna pay 7 pounds 25 delivery of 9 go to checkout and I final this is what I'll be charged and then once I've just simply entered my address and checked my payment details I can place my order and the acid will arrive at my address in 10 working days it took me what 30 seconds to order a liter of acid to my home address and as much as we can talk about regulation and as much as I can understand how difficult this is to police surely it has to be harder than this to get hold of something that could completely destroy people's lives I'm here at a home bargain store in Worcester where an alleged acid attack on a 3 year old boy in his stroller happen here in store and you know the really weird thing about being here and the wit idea that someone came in this place and attacked a woman and her child allegedly with acid is it's the most normal of settings this place is the most benign of places it's literally normal Ville and right here a group of men decided to attack a woman allegedly with acid and caught her child instead the woman was just outside here being comforted by other shoppers and paramedics screaming what have they done to my son what have they done to my son this is a active and ongoing court case so I have to be a little bit careful what I say but the six men who have been alleged to be involved in this incident wear acid was thrown on a three-year-old boy will appear here at Worcester crown court later this month one of those men is a 39 year old Afghan asylum seeker he can't be named for legal reasons but he's the father of the three-year-old boy involved in a suspected deliberate acid attack another of the guys is also an Afghan national and there's four other men who have also been involved they've been charged and they will all be appearing here all six men will appear here Worcester Crown Court at the end of this month and if I could ask them one question you know I'd ask them was it worth it the UK has earned itself the dubious title of acid capital of the world and the acid survivors Trust International confirms that the UK has the highest rate of acid attacks per capita anywhere on the planet unlike in other countries where victims are typically women in the UK most of the victims are men and the suspects tend to be male as well in 2016 77 percent of suspects were men it's also true that certain boroughs of London have a clear correlation between acid attacks and demographics in the three worst affected boroughs that would be knew him barking and dagenham and Tower Hamlets there is a high number of acid attacks and a very large population of Indian and Pakistani origin and acid attacks in these countries are particularly common but in reality only six percent of the suspects in London in the last 15 years were Asian 32 percent were white European and 38 percent of suspects were afro-caribbean and the same is true for victims as well over half the victims were white European and around a quarter were afro-caribbean in the UK everything you know about acid attacks is likely to be untrue the victims tend to be male the perpetrators tend to be male and the worst offenders are white Europeans or afro-caribbean this graph shows acid attacks in London over time so since 2010 and the number attacks back in 2010 were about 300 and that number has changed slightly it has gone up and it's gone down but what's really alarming about this graph and what it shows really well is the trend and the trend is on the up in 2017 there were 465 acid attacks in London alone and that's in just one year and I think that's the truly terrifying thing is that this trend doesn't show any sign of slowing down anytime soon I've learned a lot about acid attacks while I've been here in Worcester and one of the things I've really noticed is that the government is cracking down they are making it harder to get hold of acid in store and they are also increasing the penalties for those found with it or using it but what I think is our best defense the defense will rely on against acid attacks is to imagine they happen somewhere else they happen to other people in other places like in London or just to someone else and what I've realized being here in this super normal town filled with super lovely super polite people is acid attacks don't just happen in London acid attacks happen in perfectly polite towns and cities - and there's no reason acid attacks can't happen in a perfectly polite city near you at rebel media we believe in getting out and about to bring you the truths that the mainstream media are too lazy or not prepared to tell to hear more of my work join me at Hopkins worldcom you
