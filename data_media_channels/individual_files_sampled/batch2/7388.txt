a double-car bombing occurred in Somalia over the weekend killing more than 3 300 individuals and wounding more than 300 others now the bombing has not been claimed by any terrorist organization although there is some evidence to indicate that al-shabaab an Islamist group was behind the attack now recent reporting by the Guardian and other news outlets indicate that the double car bombing was done in response to a us-led anti-terrorism mission that was carried out in August that unfortunately only killed civilians 10 of which did die others who were wounded so let me give you the details on this latest attack first let me just say that this is the biggest terror attack bombing with the most victims in Somalia of all time in all time and so it was a story that deserved to be in the headlines of you know every major news outlet in the US but it hasn't really gotten much coverage now the man who killed more than 300 people with a truck bomb in the center of Mogadishu on Saturday was a former soldier in Somalia's army whose hometown was raided by local troops and US Special Forces two months ago in a controversial operation in which 10 civilians were killed now initially the US government indicated that oh they were attacking leaders of Islamist groups these radicals who are dangerous but reporting later indicated that no that is not what happened all of those individuals who died were in fact civilians following the raid this is the raid that happened this past August in which three children ages between 6 and 10 died local tribal elders called for revenge against the Somali government and its allies the United States being one of its allies the 10 people were civilians they were killed accidentally the government and relatives will discuss about compensation we send condolences to the families that was according to one of the politicians in Somalia following that failed you know Counter Terrorist counterterrorism mission so real quick there so just so we're absolutely clear the Somali government admitted yes they were in fact civilians that were killed and it was totally botched so there's no dispute about that and and in fact they are offering what they call blood money the relatives of the murdered civilians that's right and including the three kids families obviously and they went they got granular they went all the way down to compensating them for their animals that were killed in the raid etc now earlier in today's show I gave a US Special Forces a lot of credit for the work that they did in Raqqa and retaking that city but from time to time it goes disastrously wrong as it did in this case and if ever there was a case of us killing civilians with by accident we hope obviously and in this case I think it was coming back to haunt us and the and our allies boy this is this is it this is as bad a case as you can get now you know we make fun of Joe Scarborough because he famously once said he's trying to figure out why Islam ik radicals do terrorism so I don't know they hate us because they hate us and I repeated it three times no oftentimes they hate us because we killed one of their family members right in fact we have stats about that leader in this particular story right we do and and so I want to back up a little bit because there's a lot of context that I think a lot of Americans are unaware of because stories like this don't get attention so do most Americans know what we're doing in Yemen or what we're doing in Somalia probably not and the reality is you know drone strikes began in Yemen and Somalia under the Obama administration and he got criticized for that on this show on a regular basis however the drone strikes have been amplified under the Trump administration he has essentially lifted combat restrictions and opened the floodgates for more drone strikes in Somalia and in Yemen and so in in Somalia there has been a civil war raging since 2009 and it is a war against the government of Somalia is aiming for a more secular country and you know various Islamic groups al-shabaab being one of them and so al-shabaab throughout the civil war has basically taken over certain parts of Somalia and then because of you know u.s. involvement in other international countries getting involved they have lost certain territories and it goes on and on and on but one thing that you should keep in mind is after this us-led counterterrorism efforts in August that led to the deaths of these ten civilians some of which were children al-shabaab used imagery of their dead bodies in order to recruit individuals into their terrorist organization and so we have to be careful with what we're doing you have to make sure the Intel is foolproof and that you're not killing innocent civilians and and essentially being incredibly counterproductive in this foreign policy so look the guy who did the bombing is the one most responsible of course no one's taking away responsibility from him at the same time actions have consequences so let's be careful about our actions and I gotta be honest with you I used to be more of an interventionist so the situation in Somalia is really difficult and if the government asks us for help in fighting Islamic radicals I am very very tempted to give him that help because I don't want Islamic radicals taking over Somalia or other countries on the other hand when we intervene we have made one mess after another after another and so at what point do we realize that intervention is generally counterproductive and and here we are again on another day when it has been wildly counterproductive for mention is wildly counterproductive and so I'm not saying that you know we shouldn't ever get involved if there are terrorist organizations that are taking over entire countries overthrowing you know secular governments or whatever it is but I am saying that if you are going to utilize you know different military methods like drone strikes for instance it's not you know some frivolous thing you have to be careful with the type of Intel you have when you're trying to take people out if you're killing innocent civilians it will come and and by you you know in the behind and that's exactly what's happening here now let's go to the double car bombing that happened this past weekend let's give you some details officials say that it involved two vehicles a Toyota Noah minivan and a much larger truck carrying around 772 pounds of military-grade and homemade explosives the target for both vehicles was the heavily guarded airport compound in Mogadishu where the United Nations most embassies and the headquarters of the 22,000 strong African Union peacekeeping force AMISOM are based so this wasn't an intentional attack against you know different government agencies and also international agencies that are supportive of the current Somali government and so of course these Islamic because Islamist terrorists are trying to target them and take them out the minivan was stopped at a checkpoint several hundred meters short of its target and the driver detained the bomb later detonated possibly set off by remote control or by security officials I also want to note that as of Monday around 167 bodies were buried and they were unidentified because they were so badly burned that the government couldn't identify who the victims were also the bigger truck bomb was detonated at a busy crossroads at least a kilometer from the Medina gate the explosion ignited a fuel truck nearby which caused a massive fireball let me give a couple more piece of context here first of all let's also note that in May when this raid happened oh okay there has been a number of raids one in August led to the 10 civilians being killed okay so the I'm sorry the one in May led to two of our troops being wounded in a u.s. Navy SEAL being killed so it's not just Somali civilians that are dying here but our guys also died there's so none of this has gone well at all but I think the most important stat is the one I really wanted to give you guys the United Nations did a study on why people join up with radical groups and commit acts of terrorism of the more than five hundred former members of militant organizations interviewed for the reports 71 percent pointed to quote government action including quote killing of a family member or friend or arrest of a family member or friend as the incident that prompted them to join a group so when people say I don't know why they do it well it turns out we actually have decent evidence as to why they do it 71 percent of the time which is an overwhelming majority it's because someone they know was either arrested or killed by a government they they then later got radicalized against and committed a terrorist act against so some of the issues are certainly complicated but there are also some simple explanations you kill someone's family member they're gonna want to kill you that's kind of how it works and that is why intervention that we have done for decades and decades in the Middle East has backfired on us because the more people we kill the more people they want to kill in return and that's the state of play right now watch the young turks commercial-free downloaded a stream it watch it any way you like at TYT Network comm slash join
