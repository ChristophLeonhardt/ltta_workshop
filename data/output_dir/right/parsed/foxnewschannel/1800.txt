INTERVIEW WITH THE SECRETARY
POMPEO RIGHT AFTER OUR SHOW AT
2:00 P.M. EASTERN.
IT'S A GREAT INTERVIEW.
>> INDEED YOUR
>> U.S. EMBASSY OFFICIALLY
RELOCATES FROM TEL AVIV TO
JERUSALEM.
THE MOVE COMES AMID HIGH
TENSIONS BETWEEN ISRAEL AND
IRAN.
MORE ON THE IRANIAN SIDE IN A
MINUTE.
THIS OF COURSE MARKS COMPLETION
OF A MAJOR CAMPAIGN PROMISE FOR
THE PRESIDENT AND CLEARLY A SHOW
OF SUPPORT FOR ISRAEL BY THE
ADMINISTRATION.
WITH THAT, DAVID KING, SPOKESMAN
FOR PRIME MINISTER BENJAMIN
NETANYAHU.
24 HOURS IN THE BIG CELEBRATION.
GOOD TO SEE YOU.
LET'S LOOK BEYOND TOMORROW.
BIG CELEBRATION PLANNED BY THE
PRIME MINISTER AND THE ISRAELIS
OR PALESTINIANS AREN'T HAPPY
ABOUT IT.
THEY PLAN MAJOR PROTESTS.
LET'S LOOK TOWARDS TUESDAY AT
FORWARD.
HOW DOES THIS CHANGE THINGS?
>> WELL, CHANGES THINGS IN TWO
FUNDAMENTAL WAYS.
IT RESTORES THE BALANCE OF TRUTH
TO THE REGION AND RECOGNIZES ONE
OF THE MOST ANCIENT AND OBVIOUS
TRUTHS THERE EVER WAS IN
JERUSALEM AS THE CAPITAL OF
ISRAEL V. JEWISH PEOPLE FOR 3000
YEARS AND CAPITAL OF THE STATE
FOR 70 YEARS AND IT'S HIGH TIME
THE REST OF THE WORLD RECOGNIZE
IT AS WELL.
IT ALSO ADVANCES PEACE IN A VERY
MAJOR WAY BECAUSE PEACE CANNOT
BE BUILT ON A FOUNDATION OF
LIES.
HE'S HAS TO BE BUILT ON A
FOUNDATION OF TRUTH AND THIS IS
THE FIRST TIME IN A VERY LONG
TIME WHERE WE ARE STUDYING WHAT
THE TRUTH HAS BEEN SAID ABOUT
JERUSALEM, ISRAEL, THIS REGION
AND THAT'S PRECISELY WHY IT IS A
WONDERFUL STEP.
LELAND: THAT IS AN ANALYSIS THAT
I HAVE NOT QUITE HEARD FROM
SHALL WE SAY THE PALESTINIAN
SIDE.
THEY ARE GOING TO WALK AWAY
ESSENTIALLY FROM THE NEGOTIATING
TABLE AND RETURN, SOME WOULD
CALL OF VIOLENCE.
OTHERS WOULD CALL A PROTEST,
WHETHER IT BE IN GAZA OR THE
WEST BANK.
THE IDF IS READY FOR WHATEVER
COMES THIS WEEK THEY SAY.
DOES THEM WALK GOING AWAY REALLY
MATTER TO YOUR GOVERNMENT?
>> SURE IT MATTERS.
IT MAKES IT A LOT HARDER TO
OBTAIN.
PALESTINIAN LEADERSHIP HAS
WALKED AWAY A LONG TIME AGO.
THEY SAID NO TO EVERY SINGLE ONE
OF OUR OVERTURES FOR
NEGOTIATIONS.
INSTEAD THEY PAY HUNDREDS OF
MILLIONS OF DOLLARS TO
TERRORISTS AND MURDERERS AND
FAMILIES OF TERRORIST.
ONE EXAMPLE, WHO MURDERED ALMOST
AN ENTIRE FAMILY IS BEING PAID
$2 MILLION OVER THE COURSE OF
HIS LIFETIME.
IMAGINE A $2 MILLION TO DO IF IT
WENT TO PEACE INSTEAD OF
TERRORISTS.
IT'S NOT THE FIRST TIME THE
PALACE AND INTERCEDE NO.
WE HOPE THEY SAY YES BECAUSE THE
DIALOGUE AND DISCUSSION AND
COMPROMISE.
>> BUT DAVID, IF THERE ARE
EVENTS THAT HAPPENED THAT YOUR
GOVERNMENT PUSHED FOR, WHICH WAS
DISMISSED FROM TEL AVIV TO
JERUSALEM AND NOW YOU SAY
BECAUSE OF THIS MOVE THE
PALESTINIANS HAVE DONE SOMETHING
THAT MAKES PEACE HARDER TO COME
BY.
HOW CAN YOU HAVE IT BOTH WAYS?
>> IT'S NOT BOTH WAYS.
THEY SAID NO LONG BEFORE IT WAS
MOVED TO JERUSALEM.
LELAND: HOW DO YOU MAKE THINGS
EASIER?
>> IT MAKES IT EASIER BECAUSE
THE REST OF THE WORLD CAN SAY TO
THE PALESTINIANS AT TIME TO GET
REAL.
THIS IS THE CAPITAL OF ISRAEL
AND ITS NOT GOING ANYWHERE.
IT WILL BE THE CAPITAL OF
ISRAEL.
SO ONE OF THE WORLD IN THE
PALACE INDIANS ENTERTAIN
FANTASIES, MAYBE IT'S NOT IN
JERUSALEM.
RIGHT BEHIND ME IS THE KNESSET,
THE GOVERNMENT AND THE SUPREME
COURT IN THE PRIME MINISTER'S
OFFICE IN THE FOREIGN TRADE ALL
HERE IN JERUSALEM.
FOR THE VERY FIRST TIME IN A
LONG TIME, IT TELLS THE REST OF
THE WORLD THIS IS EXACTLY WHERE
THE CAPITAL IS.
IT'S TIME TO GET REAL.
>> I STOOD WHERE YOU ARE MANY
TIMES ANY APPRECIATE YOU STAYING
FOCUSED WITH THE SOUNDS OF WHAT
A SUNDAY NIGHT IN JERUSALEM
BEHIND YOU.
BY WAY OF EXPLANATION, DO OUR
VIEWERS KNOW BY NOW TO THE ISSUE
OF IRAN?
IT DOESN'T SEEM TO WANT PEACE
WITH ANYBODY BE AT THE ATTACK ON
ISRAEL FROM SYRIA A COUPLE DAYS
AGO.
OR CHANTING DEATH TO AMERICA IN
THE STREETS ON FRIDAY.
LISTEN TO THE SECRETARY OF STATE
ON "FOX NEWS SUNDAY" TO GET YOUR
REACTION.
>> I THINK HASSAN ROUHANI NEEDS
TO EXPLAIN WHY IS THE CASE THAT
WHILE THE AGREEMENT WAS IN PLACE
IRAN CONTINUED ACROSS THE MIDDLE
EAST.
LELAND: HOW CONCERNED IS YOUR
COUNTRY WOULD YOU PLAN TO DO
ABOUT IT?
>> ARRANGE A SHOT 20 MISSILES
INTO ISRAEL.
IRAN HAS MOVED ITS ARMY A
THOUSAND MILES WEST.
WHAT ON EARTH IS HE DOING AT
ISRAEL'S BORDER?
TO GET THE ANSWER TO THAT
QUESTION COME YOU HAVE TO LISTEN
TO WHAT THE LEADERSHIP SAYS.
THEY ARE NOT JUST SHOUTING DEATH
TO ISRAEL.
THEY ARE SHOUTING DEATH TO
AMERICA AND THEY SAID OVER AND
OVER AGAIN WE WILL ANNIHILATE
THE STATE OF ISRAEL.
A FEW DAYS AGO THE PRIME
MINISTER EXPOSED OVER 100,000
SECRET DOCUMENTS FROM IRAN,
SECRET NUCLEAR ARCHIVE WHICH
PROVES BEYOND A SHADOW OF A
DOUBT THAT IRAN HAD A
COMPREHENSIVE PROGRAM TO BUILD A
NUCLEAR WEAPON IN THE IRANIAN
LEADERSHIP WAS LYING THROUGH ITS
TEETH ARE JUST A FEW DAYS AGO
THE FOREIGN MINISTER SAID WE
NEVER WANTED TO BUILD A BOMB
EXCEPT FOR THE FACT THAT THEY
HAD AN ENTIRE METHODICALLY
CATALOGED ARSENAL -- ARCHIVE.
LELAND: DAVID, THIS BRINGS UP AN
IMPORTANT POINT AND THAT IS
REASONABLE PEOPLE COULD AGREE
THERE WAS NOT A LOT OF LOVE LOST
BETWEEN PRESIDENT OBAMA AND YOUR
PRIME MINISTER NETANYAHU AND
SOME FUNDAMENTAL DISAGREEMENTS
ABOUT IRAN'S NUCLEAR PROGRAM.
WHAT IS IT LIKE NOW TO HAVE AN
ADMINISTRATION THAT IS SO
SUPPORTIVE OF ISRAEL, SO
SUPPORTIVE OF YOUR ACTIONS
AGAINST IRAN AND IN LOCKSTEP?
>> WELL, LET ME SAY THE
RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE UNITED
STATES OF AMERICA AND ISRAEL HAS
NEVER BEEN STRONGER THAN IT IS
TODAY.
THIS IS A PROFOUNDLY IMPORTANT
WEEK.
THE RECOGNITION OF JERUSALEM,
THE MOVING OF THE EMBASSY AND
THE ENDING OF THE IRAN NUCLEAR
DEAL, WHICH PUT IRAN ON THE PATH
TOWARDS AN ARSENAL OF NUCLEAR
WEAPONS AND HAD IDEAL BEEN
ALLOWED TO CONTINUE, IRAN
WOULD'VE BEEN WELL PLACED TO
HAVE A MASSIVE AMOUNT OF
ENRICHED URANIUM FOR ONE
SINGULAR PURPOSE.
THE DESTRUCTION OF ISRAEL.
I KNOW THAT AMERICA IS SUCH A
STRONG ALLY AND THEY COULDN'T
STAND BY AND LET THAT HAPPEN.
THERE'S A TREMENDOUS TREMENDOUS
CONVERGENCE NOT JUST OF INTEREST
AND OF VALUES, BUT A WAY OF
SEEING THE MIDDLE EAST TODAY AND
IT'S NO DOUBT THAT IRAN REMAINS
THE BIGGEST THREAT IN THE ENTIRE
MIDDLE EAST AND IT'S IMPORTANT
ENTIRE WORLD AND EVERYBODY WAS
PEACE AND HUMAN RIGHTS AND
JUSTICE WORK TO CHANGE THE
POLICIES OF THIS DANGEROUS
REGIME IN TEHRAN.
>> NOTEWORTHY NOW, THERE ARE SO
MANY ARAB COUNTRIES THAT AGREE
WITH THE SENTIMENT THAT IRAN NOW
IS THE BIGGEST THREAT TO PEACE,
WHETHER IT BE THE SAUDI'S ARE
SOME OF THE GULF STATES AS WELL.
