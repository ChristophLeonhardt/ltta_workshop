extra party with tight security 40,000 people turned out this weekend in Paris to protest the French president's economic reforms and what they're calling a party for micron the heavy police things as a result of this week's Mayday rallies that did turn violent now although this event generally passed out off without incident at least one police officer is reported to have been injured Shallah do been skis among the protesters so the police have just moved into the Basti area which is the end part of the protest and they have started making what seemed to me some arrests so far that's after some of the protesters damaged a van you might be able to see in the distance smashing the screen and they also attempted to set it on fire there are around a 2000 John calm a police out and course in Paris today to try and keep the violence at this protest to a minimum after the violence that was witnessed on the May Day protests on Tuesday when almost 200 people also were arrested from a ground crowd of around at 1200 ultra militant leftists as they were described by the police now you may be able to see behind me some of the people have covered their faces and they're generally people who describe themselves as being anti-capitalist anti-fascist and they don't want to be seen and identified now many of the people came here to protest against the policies of the Macan government over the last year that's because on Monday it is a year since he was elected for the moment it feels like it is quite a calm but tense standoff between the police and the protesters here as the police have moved in to try and protect this area where the protesters had been trying to damage some of this property but as you can properly hear they're describing the police in their chants as being race and these are people who tend to hate the police I mean normally we hear them saying all the world hates the police you get a sense of that tension of these protesters who initially came here to protest against that year in power of mr. Macklin but what they are is against the system capitalism and pretty much anything that go against the the natural form of what they want and what they want they've said in the past is to bring that power to the street
