1
00:00:00,392 --> 00:00:01,760
SAYING NO, WE DON'T WANT TO DO

2
00:00:01,760 --> 00:00:03,696
ANYTHING THAT WOULD SOLVE THE

3
00:00:03,696 --> 00:00:04,029
PROBLEM.

4
00:00:04,029 --> 00:00:06,565
WE WANT TO FOCUS ON TRUMP AT ALL

5
00:00:06,565 --> 00:00:06,865
TIMES.

6
00:00:06,865 --> 00:00:08,167
>> Bret: STANDBY.

7
00:00:08,167 --> 00:00:09,969
MARK MEADOWS WALKING OUT,

8
00:00:09,969 --> 00:00:10,569
JOINING US.

9
00:00:10,569 --> 00:00:11,837
THANKS FOR BEING HERE.

10
00:00:11,837 --> 00:00:13,839
GIVE US THE INSIDE SCOOP.

11
00:00:13,839 --> 00:00:17,676
>> OBVIOUSLY IT WAS A LONG

12
00:00:17,676 --> 00:00:19,411
MEETING WHERE THE PRESIDENT WAS

13
00:00:19,411 --> 00:00:20,546
TALKING ABOUT NOT ONLY THE

14
00:00:20,546 --> 00:00:21,313
AGENDA ON IMMIGRATION BUT WHAT

15
00:00:21,313 --> 00:00:22,081
WE HAVE ACCOMPLISHED AND WHAT WE

16
00:00:22,081 --> 00:00:24,750
NEED TO DO FROM HERE.

17
00:00:24,750 --> 00:00:25,851
IT'S ALL ABOUT GETTING IT DONE.

18
00:00:25,851 --> 00:00:27,753
HE REALLY WANTS US TO MAKE SURE

19
00:00:27,753 --> 00:00:29,855
WE PUT UP 218 VOTES ON THE HOUSE

20
00:00:29,855 --> 00:00:31,857
FLOOR THIS WEEK.

21
00:00:31,857 --> 00:00:35,160
HE SAID HE IS BEHIND US 1000%.

22
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:36,462
OBVIOUSLY WANTS TO DEAL WITH

23
00:00:36,462 --> 00:00:37,129
THIS SEPARATION ISSUE WITH

24
00:00:37,129 --> 00:00:41,133
CHILDREN AT THE BORDER.

25
00:00:41,133 --> 00:00:42,234
BOTH BILLS DO THAT.

26
00:00:42,234 --> 00:00:45,571
THE COMPROMISE BILL OR THE

27
00:00:45,571 --> 00:00:46,472
LEADERSHIP BILL IS CERTAINLY THE

28
00:00:46,472 --> 00:00:49,274
ONE THAT SEEMS TO HAVE THE MOST,

29
00:00:49,274 --> 00:00:51,777
THE HIGHEST PROBABILITY OF

30
00:00:51,777 --> 00:00:52,311
GETTING TWO TO 18.

31
00:00:52,311 --> 00:00:55,748
>> Bret: THE PRESIDENT WALKED

32
00:00:55,748 --> 00:00:56,749
BY.

33
00:00:56,749 --> 00:00:58,684
DEMOCRATS CHANTING ABOUT GETTING

34
00:00:58,684 --> 00:00:59,752
FAMILIES TOGETHER.

35
00:00:59,752 --> 00:01:00,652
DID THE PRESIDENT SAY THAT HE

36
00:01:00,652 --> 00:01:04,790
KNOWS THAT HE CAN DO A CHANGE

37
00:01:04,790 --> 00:01:05,157
HIMSELF?

38
00:01:05,157 --> 00:01:06,792
HOW DID HE PLAY IT WITH THE

39
00:01:06,792 --> 00:01:07,359
LEGISLATION?

40
00:01:07,359 --> 00:01:08,560
>> HE DIDN'T DO THAT.

41
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:10,062
HE HAD SECRETARY NIELSEN THERE

42
00:01:10,062 --> 00:01:12,097
AND OBVIOUSLY SHE WAS THERE THE

43
00:01:12,097 --> 00:01:13,499
ROOM AND TALKING ABOUT THE FACT

44
00:01:13,499 --> 00:01:16,368
THAT WE HAVE GOT TO FIND A REAL

45
00:01:16,368 --> 00:01:16,869
SOLUTION TO THIS.

46
00:01:16,869 --> 00:01:19,104
THIS IS MORE A LEGISLATIVE

47
00:01:19,104 --> 00:01:19,471
SOLUTION.

48
00:01:19,471 --> 00:01:21,206
THIS IS SOMETHING WE HAVE BEEN

49
00:01:21,206 --> 00:01:23,008
DEALING WITH A LONG TIME.

50
00:01:23,008 --> 00:01:24,610
WHEN YOU LOOK AT PRODUCTION OF

51
00:01:24,610 --> 00:01:28,480
CHILDREN, THAT'S WHY THIS DEGREE

52
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:29,181
CAME DOWN ORIGINALLY.

53
00:01:29,181 --> 00:01:31,784
THEY BELIEVE IT'S BEST WE GET A

54
00:01:31,784 --> 00:01:32,351
LEGISLATIVE SOLUTION.

55
00:01:32,351 --> 00:01:33,585
I THINK THERE ARE SOME NARROW

56
00:01:33,585 --> 00:01:36,255
BILLS IN THE HOUSE AND SENATE

57
00:01:36,255 --> 00:01:39,792
THAT WILL ADDRESS THIS ISSUE.

58
00:01:39,792 --> 00:01:41,660
I AM HEARING CHUCK SCHUMER IS

59
00:01:41,660 --> 00:01:43,562
NOT SUPPORTIVE OF ANY

60
00:01:43,562 --> 00:01:44,096
LEGISLATIVE EFFORT.

61
00:01:44,096 --> 00:01:45,397
>> Bret: WE REPORT ABOUT AND

62
00:01:45,397 --> 00:01:47,199
THAT'S WHAT HE SAID TODAY TO

63
00:01:47,199 --> 00:01:47,566
REPORTERS.

64
00:01:47,566 --> 00:01:48,967
THERE IS NOT A REPUBLICAN

65
00:01:48,967 --> 00:01:50,569
LEGISLATIVE SOLUTION THAT

66
00:01:50,569 --> 00:01:52,204
DEMOCRATS WILL SIGN ONTO.

67
00:01:52,204 --> 00:01:52,971
YOUR REACTION.

68
00:01:52,971 --> 00:01:54,606
>> MY REACTION IS READ THE

69
00:01:54,606 --> 00:01:55,074
BILLS.

70
00:01:55,074 --> 00:01:58,644
WE HAVE INTRODUCED A BILL,

71
00:01:58,644 --> 00:01:59,378
SENATOR TED CRUZ HAS INTRODUCED

72
00:01:59,378 --> 00:02:00,813
A BILL.

73
00:02:00,813 --> 00:02:02,948
IS HE SAYING THAT THERE IS NO

74
00:02:02,948 --> 00:02:03,615
LEGISLATIVE SOLUTION?

75
00:02:03,615 --> 00:02:05,684
WHEN YOU LOOK AT THAT, I THINK

76
00:02:05,684 --> 00:02:06,418
THE AMERICAN PEOPLE WANT US TO

77
00:02:06,418 --> 00:02:06,952
SOLVE IT.

78
00:02:06,952 --> 00:02:08,353
I'VE BEEN GETTING CALLS ALL DAY

79
00:02:08,353 --> 00:02:08,787
LONG.

80
00:02:08,787 --> 00:02:10,989
AT THE SAME TIME, THEY WANT US

81
00:02:10,989 --> 00:02:12,591
TO COME TOGETHER, DEMOCRATS AND

82
00:02:12,591 --> 00:02:12,991
REPUBLICANS.

83
00:02:12,991 --> 00:02:14,793
A NUMBER OF US ARE GIVING THEM

84
00:02:14,793 --> 00:02:16,095
THE OPPORTUNITY TO DO THAT.

85
00:02:16,095 --> 00:02:17,596
>> Bret: I WANT TO LISTEN IN

86
00:02:17,596 --> 00:02:20,365
AND SEE IF THE PRESIDENT SAYS

87
00:02:20,365 --> 00:02:21,433
ANYTHING AS HE IS WITH THE HOUSE

88
00:02:21,433 --> 00:02:25,571
MAJORITY LEADER, McCARTHY.

89
00:02:25,571 --> 00:02:32,578
>> Reporter: MR. PRESIDENT  .

90
00:02:32,578 --> 00:02:33,445
>> President Trump: THESE LAWS

91
00:02:33,445 --> 00:02:35,147
HAVE BEEN BROKEN FOR MANY YEARS,

92
00:02:35,147 --> 00:02:35,481
DECADES.

93
00:02:35,481 --> 00:02:38,550
WE HAD A GREAT MEETING.

94
00:02:38,550 --> 00:02:39,585
>> Bret: REITERATING WHAT HE

95
00:02:39,585 --> 00:02:40,686
SAID GOING IN, THAT THE LAWS

96
00:02:40,686 --> 00:02:43,355
HAVE BEEN BROKEN FOR DECADES.

97
00:02:43,355 --> 00:02:44,089
I HAD A GREAT.

98
00:02:44,089 --> 00:02:47,559
DID HE TALK A LOT ABOUT

99
00:02:47,559 --> 00:02:48,594
IMMIGRATION OR WAS IT A MIXED?

100
00:02:48,594 --> 00:02:50,562
>> IT WAS A MIX.

101
00:02:50,562 --> 00:02:51,230
HE STARTED WITH IMMIGRATION.

102
00:02:51,230 --> 00:02:55,634
HE CAME BACK TO IMMIGRATION AT

103
00:02:55,634 --> 00:02:56,602
THE MIDDLE AND AN KNACKERED WE

104
00:02:56,602 --> 00:02:58,537
TALKED ABOUT REGULATION, WE

105
00:02:58,537 --> 00:03:01,240
TALKED ABOUT THE ASSOCIATION OF

106
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:03,442
HEALTH PLANS TO BRING DOWN

107
00:03:03,442 --> 00:03:07,379
PREMIUMS FOR HEALTH CARE THAT HE

108
00:03:07,379 --> 00:03:09,181
IS SIGNING WITH THE SECRETARY OF

109
00:03:09,181 --> 00:03:09,781
LABOR.

110
00:03:09,781 --> 00:03:10,616
>> Bret: IS THEIR URGENCY HERE

111
00:03:10,616 --> 00:03:13,485
OR IS THIS AN ISSUE BOTH SIDES

112
00:03:13,485 --> 00:03:14,786
ARE PLAYING POLITICS WITH?

113
00:03:14,786 --> 00:03:16,889
>> OUR SIDE IS NOT PLAYING

114
00:03:16,889 --> 00:03:17,789
POLITICS WITH IT.

115
00:03:17,789 --> 00:03:20,025
I HAD MY STAFF WORKING FOR THE

116
00:03:20,025 --> 00:03:23,996
WEEKEND, BUT A LEGISLATIVE FIX.

117
00:03:23,996 --> 00:03:25,230
77 PAGES THAT WE WORKED AROUND

118
00:03:25,230 --> 00:03:26,265
THE CLOCK TO GET INTRODUCED

119
00:03:26,265 --> 00:03:26,565
TODAY.

120
00:03:26,565 --> 00:03:30,169
WE DID THAT AT NOON.

121
00:03:30,169 --> 00:03:32,371
IT'S ABOUT GETTING THE JOB DONE

122
00:03:32,371 --> 00:03:32,671
RIGHT.

123
00:03:32,671 --> 00:03:34,973
UNFORTUNATELY, IT'S BEEN A

124
00:03:34,973 --> 00:03:35,908
POLITICAL FOOTBALL BACK AND

125
00:03:35,908 --> 00:03:36,909
FORTH AND WHEN YOU'RE DEALING

126
00:03:36,909 --> 00:03:38,510
WITH PEOPLE'S LIVES, YOU'VE GOT

127
00:03:38,510 --> 00:03:40,212
TO MAKE SURE YOU GET IT DONE

128
00:03:40,212 --> 00:03:40,512
RIGHT.

129
00:03:40,512 --> 00:03:41,980
HOPEFULLY WE WELL AND I BELIEVE

130
00:03:41,980 --> 00:03:43,382
WE WELL THIS WEEK.

131
00:03:43,382 --> 00:03:47,753
>> Bret: WERE REPUBLICAN

132
00:03:47,753 --> 00:03:49,855
SAYING WE NEED TO DO A NARROW

133
00:03:49,855 --> 00:03:51,223
BILL OR THE PRESIDENT HAS TO

134
00:03:51,223 --> 00:03:51,757
CHANGE THE DYNAMIC?

135
00:03:51,757 --> 00:03:56,528
>> THE FOCUS WAS ON THE

136
00:03:56,528 --> 00:03:57,396
COMPREHENSIVE BILLS.

137
00:03:57,396 --> 00:03:59,298
THERE WAS DISCUSSION ABOUT A

138
00:03:59,298 --> 00:03:59,765
NARROW BILL.

139
00:03:59,765 --> 00:04:00,999
THE SEPARATION ISSUE DID COME UP

140
00:04:00,999 --> 00:04:05,404
A COUPLE TIMES, AND THE

141
00:04:05,404 --> 00:04:06,171
PRESIDENT WAS VERY COMPASSIONATE

142
00:04:06,171 --> 00:04:07,773
ABOUT IT, TALKED ABOUT HIS

143
00:04:07,773 --> 00:04:08,974
DAUGHTER BRINGING THAT UP,

144
00:04:08,974 --> 00:04:09,308
IVANKA.

145
00:04:09,308 --> 00:04:11,376
WHEN YOU LOOK AT THAT, IT'S NOT

146
00:04:11,376 --> 00:04:12,678
LOST ON HIM THAT WE'VE GOT TO

147
00:04:12,678 --> 00:04:13,045
FIX THIS.

148
00:04:13,045 --> 00:04:15,814
BUT AT THE SAME TIME, WE'VE GOT

149
00:04:15,814 --> 00:00:00,000
THIS FOR WEEK.
