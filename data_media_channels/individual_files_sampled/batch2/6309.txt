Republicans have been historically resistant to any and all attempts to regulate guns in the country in fact some Democrats who lean conservative have been resistant and it's interesting to see that after the mass shooting that took place in Las Vegas killing fifty-eight innocent individuals now some Republicans and even the NRA are changing their tune about one specific part that the shooter was able to legally purchase now this has to do with bump stocks bump stocks are devices that essentially turn a semi-automatic weapon to a weapon that acts as an automatic weapon and police officials have confirmed that they found 12 weapons in the shooters hotel room that were fashioned with bump stocks now interestingly enough the NRA has released a statement saying that yeah maybe Congress should consider regulation of this device let me read you their exact statement of course there's a little political jab in the beginning of it despite the fact that the Obama administration approved the sale of bump stocks at on at least two occasions the National Rifle Association Association is calling on the ATF to immediately review whether these devices comply with federal law the NRA believes that device is designed to allow semi-automatic rifles to function like fully automatic rifles should be subject to additional regulations so there's two things happening there they say that the ATF should review these devices to see if they comply with federal law they also say that the Obama regulate administration okayed it who do you think okayed it the ATF that's right it's a statement from the ATF so this is a very strange thing to say I love the second part I love the second part where it says we think that that we should have you know the the law which says no automatic weapons which has been in place for many since the eighties the spirit of that law is we don't we don't want to automatic weapons because we don't want rounds to be fired off that fast we should make sure that in practice that's what we're making sure happens is that people don't fire off rounds that fast but to send it back to the ATF you're just doing the same thing again right you are absolutely right about that and I like that you specified it because look what they were referring to when they said the Obama administration okay did these bump stocks was correct but in revealing that they also reveal that they might be a little disingenuous in their statements so let me give you the the historical context of it okay so I'm gonna skip ahead to graphic 19 a and it there were two companies that were trying to market these bump stocks but they were concerned about their legality and so they wanted to make sure that they could talk to the government about it and make sure they're complying with federal laws in marketing the devices to Texas companies bump fire systems and slide fire solutions were apparently concerned that they would not be legal but in June of 2010 the Bureau of Alcohol Tobacco Firearms and Explosives or ATF sent a letter saying that the companies bump stock product is a firearm part and is not regulated as a firearm under the gun control act or the National Firearms Act so that is the first time that the Obama administration you know okayed the bump stocks now I was trying to find an example of the second time that the NRA referenced in their statement I couldn't find anything but the only thing I did find was that Dianne Feinstein introduced a bill back in January of 2013 asking to ban bump stocks and Republicans and some Democrats were so resistant to that legislation which also included other gun control measures that it didn't even come up for a vote so maybe that's the second time that they're referring to but I don't see any other example of the Obama administration trying to ban it trying to approve it bump stocks aren't the only thing that allows your gun to do this right that's what's so true that's what's it's it's great you want to say Obama okayed it fine burn you got me I'm sorry oh let's get rid of them yeah what I'm concerned about now is we're gonna focus on bump stocks not the other I mean there's so many devices out there there's one that's like a glove that just has a little device on the end that goes like this there's another one that's like a little clip that goes behind your gun your trigger so that you pull on the trigger and it pushes back and that happens there's another one that looks like a Gatling gun wheel that you just stick in there and you go like this and it shoots just as fast when you look when you read the actual letter that the ATF sent back to the manufacturers who to their credit the makers of this were like I want to make sure that it's legal so they went through their process if you read that use this the ATF is like you know I read my law and my law says it needs to have certain in order to ban something it needs to be a gun with certain internal mechanisms that fire quickly and this doesn't seem to have that so the NRA isn't is encouraging that regulations we put in place but that would take an act of Congress which they control you're right and and so the legislation that's written can't specifically single out bump stocks it has to be written in such a way that makes it clear that any type of device that transforms a semi-automatic weapon to an automatic one is outlawed it's banned right so they look that's why the wording of the legislation is so important and you know my second point that's related to that is and I'm guilty of this as well now I want to be honest about it a lot of times when it comes to people who are in Congress drafting this legislation a lot of them don't even really understand how a lot of these weapons work or what's out there on the market and and I'm cognizant of that and I'm also cognizant of my own limitation so I try to be careful in what I proposed and I try to be careful about you know understanding what I'm talking about because I don't want to miss inform anyone but these are lawmakers who have strong positions on gun control or strong positions against them and you just want to make sure that these lawmakers don't act out of emotion and they actually like look at the market and look at what's out there and and draft legislation that's specific enough to you know deal with issues that would lead to terrible situations like this mass shooting not even just out of emotion out of reflex is what it is like there's this one quote from the Gun Owners of America that says we see this as an item that is certainly protected by the Second Amendment and realistically there are already on the market so passing the law banning them isn't going to stop the bad guys like this creep in Las Vegas it's it's like the Second Amendment say it say the words Second Amendment evil will do evil and move on yeah I actually want to cite that quote because it comes from a very specific person his name is Eric Pratt he is the executive director of Gun Owners of America and he's basically saying like well you know it's already out there in the market and criminals are gonna be criminals so whatever I just that I can't believe anyone buys that argument because then you can apply that argument to anything you could apply to anything you could say terrorists are gonna be terrorists so how about we don't vet anyone that comes into the country why are we gonna pass regulations vetting Muslims vetting anyone who cares let them in because if the bad guys want to come into the country they're gonna come into the country part of me says like the difference someone at the ATF will say we'll just need to write a letter that says actually we looked at it and the spirit of the existing legislation is such that we want to ban the rapid-fire is what we're getting at and and and that wording as it exists is is okay to ban these these things the the sad truth is with this situation and a ton of other situations revolving around gun violence is these things are sold out yeah they are the two companies that I mentioned earlier that originally went to the ATF to see whether the device would be legal their websites have crashed because of high demand people are super excited and jazzed about it which is insane I want to read you a quote from one I would say courageous person in admitting to the public that he loves the idea of this this part let's go to graphic 21 he says this is private citizen but he spoke to the press about it he says I don't even have the gun for it meeting the gun for the bump stock but I want the stock just to have it down the line I just like the idea of them and want to see how it feels and if it's worth it for a hundred dollars it's almost not a bad investment to buy it try it out and sell it if I don't like it I mean just that you know it's a commercial want to towards something that's used to kill so many people is amazing to me it's just like any product you're you're introducing an element of scarcity and impending the idea that it would not be around anymore so people are gonna gobble them up yeah and have them it's but that's no reason not to do this like there is every reason to stop the production of these products so that people do not go and get them so that it does not happen again and and I am really happy that the NRA said this I hope that everyone understands this is not the only you can't just say bump stocks done let's move on there are other items just like this and if you are going to outlaw the bump stock which a lot of people say is too hard to use because you have to like push and pull at the same time these other ones are just like you put your finger in and that's it we've got to get rid of things that makes semi-automatic weapons behave as automatic weapons agree the difference between the amount of bullets this shooter put off and a fully automatic weapon was four bullets in a minute it was 90 and 94 or something like that as opposed to in San Bernardino it was like 24 right which is still a lot but but you can't argue against the fact yeah I agree with you now I'm just real quick just to be fair that was the statement from the NRA some Republicans are also saying that the regulation should be considered that it doesn't necessarily mean that these lawmakers these Republican lawmakers want the regulation and are aggressive about it but they're saying it should be considered if you like this video you probably like independent media the best way to support independent media become a member
