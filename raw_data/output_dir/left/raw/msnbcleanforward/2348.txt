joining me now Julia what's the latest

8
00:00:13,460 --> 00:00:16,049
<font color="#CCCCCC">so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Andy I think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a big takeaway here is</font>

9
00:00:16,049 --> 00:00:18,150
<font color="#CCCCCC">that there are</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> nearly 3,000 children</font>

10
00:00:18,150 --> 00:00:20,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">that HHS is working to reunite we</font>

11
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:21,539
<font color="#E5E5E5">previously</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> thought they just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> had</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

12
00:00:21,539 --> 00:00:23,939
little over<font color="#CCCCCC"> 2000 in their custody</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

13
00:00:23,939 --> 00:00:26,730
reason<font color="#E5E5E5"> that number is bigger HHS says is</font>

14
00:00:26,730 --> 00:00:28,590
because<font color="#CCCCCC"> the court order is requiring</font>

15
00:00:28,590 --> 00:00:30,750
them to<font color="#CCCCCC"> look back even before Trump</font>

16
00:00:30,750 --> 00:00:32,700
<font color="#CCCCCC">started that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> zero tolerance policy</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> so</font>

17
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:34,079
these are children who<font color="#E5E5E5"> were separated</font>

18
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:36,540
perhaps before<font color="#E5E5E5"> May 6 when that went to</font>

19
00:00:36,540 --> 00:00:38,190
effect they<font color="#CCCCCC"> also</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think that some of</font>

20
00:00:38,190 --> 00:00:39,840
<font color="#CCCCCC">these children</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> might have been separated</font>

21
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:41,969
on their journey<font color="#E5E5E5"> maybe by smugglers and</font>

22
00:00:41,969 --> 00:00:43,500
they don't understand<font color="#CCCCCC"> that they weren't</font>

23
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:45,420
<font color="#CCCCCC">actually separated by the US</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> government</font>

24
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:46,980
so they say the number<font color="#E5E5E5"> could come down</font>

25
00:00:46,980 --> 00:00:49,230
<font color="#CCCCCC">but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> they</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> these very strict court</font>

deported with their families going

39
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:17,460
forward they'll be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to keep them</font>
