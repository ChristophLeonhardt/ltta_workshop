welcome back if the Trump administration wants to cut a lasting deal with North Korea though probably are gonna have to sell it to Congress the lack of a congressionally ratified deal is what ended up sinking President Obama's deal with Iran so what does Congress think joining me now is somebody who took the lead on taking on President Obama in the around a little Arkansas Republican Senator Tom cotton and I'm curious what he thinks of this deal now senator cotton welcome back to the show hey Chuck it's good to be on with you so I know I've seen what you've said to Hugh and I know you're you're sort of I guess you're a cautious skeptic or an optimistic skeptic but what is the role you want Congress to play on this deal and do you want it to be just as stringent as what as what you did with the Obama administration in the Iran deal well Chuck let me address your first point first I think it's important to say that we don't yet have a deal with North Korea we have commitments from Kim jong-un to denuclearize North Korea but as the president said in this press conference earlier today it's going to take many months to negotiate that out with secretary Pompeo leading the negotiations on our side and we should be skeptical because of the Kim family's long history of duplicity in these kind of negotiations whatever happens however I think it will be able agreement and it will have longevity that other agreements have not in the past if Congress or I should say the Senate ratifies it as treaty secretary Pompeo said he wants to do that as has the president when you get 67 senators to agree to anything that by definition represents a widespread broad bipartisan agreement among the American people that's the way to have a durable stable lasting agreement with North Korea if Kim jong-un is serious about his commitments I want to bring up a statement you put out about him about a month ago you wrote this North Korea is a long history of demanding concessions merely to negotiate well past administration's of both parties have fallen for this ruse I commend the president for seeing through Kim jong-un's fraud as I have long said our maximum pressure campaign on North Korea must continue now you put out that statement in that 48-hour period where I think the president canceled the summit then it went back on I have to say it certainly looks to me as if the president can gave concessions in order to negotiate which is what you were hoping he wouldn't do here what do you think changed well Chuck I think the main point is that the president hasn't given any concessions on the most important measures we have that brought North Korea to the negotiating table which is our maximum pressure campaign of economic sanctions and financial isolation an interdiction of the illicit shipments at sea the meeting today was a meeting that needed occur on a face-to-face basis to start down these negotiating next steps but past administration's of both parties have been too willing to relax sanctions on North Korea simply for the fact of sitting down to start negotiating or for easily reverse promise that's what President Trump and secretary Pompeo have said we will not do and I don't expect we well in the months ahead the president though already gave a huge concession as far as some are concerned by number one calling off military exercises with with South Korea and number two calling them provocative and war games which is the rhetoric of China and North Korea Chris or Chuck I think the Secretary of Defense has since come out and said he was aware of the president's decision and he supports it will maintain full readiness we continue our day to day training exercises with South Korean troops also the single biggest exercise we conduct with South Korean troops every year old Eagle just occurred about a month ago so we'll have 10 or 11 months before that exercise begins again to know whether Kim jong-un is keeping his commitments and I'm pretty confident we'll know well in advance at that time whether he is keeping his commitments and it doesn't sound like you would have doesn't sound like you would have recommend advised the president that put that on the table in this first meeting I would simply I would simply have said we should continue to negotiate at the ministerial level secretary Pompeo and maybe Kim Jong Gul with whom he met in New York but again the biggest single exercise we have happens in the spring it just happens we have about 10 - or 11 months before it happens again secretary of Madison said it won't impair our readiness our troops on the South Korean peninsula will remain ready to fight tonight the president though does seem intent on eventually getting the US military out of that region out of South Korea I was just talking with Ambassador Hill as he said there's 3,000 years of historical reasons historical evidence as to why the Koreans aren't interested in China being their security umbrella and that they still would like the United States to be that security umbrella are you concerned that the president doesn't believe in these security umbrellas for our allies no I think the president recognizes that South Korea and Japan are our two critical partners in Northeast Asia we have large number of troops in both countries both countries pay most of the cost of having those troops there one thing I think the president is acknowledging though is if we do have you know a breakthrough with North Korea not just to denuclearize but perhaps to allow the korean people's to begin to negotiate to finally sign a peace treaty 53 years after the Korean War ended and maybe potentially even reunify as Germany yet and after the fall of the Cold War then we would reconsider our posture on the Korean Peninsula but Chuck that's years away the immediate thing we have to do is make sure that we denuclearize North Korea holding Kim jong-un to his commitments in the meantime continue our millet presents in South Korea and Japan which is a guarantee of stability in that region which is so critical to our economic security as well I'm gonna ask you about ZTE you I think in a bipartisan way have been among the leaders in this if essentially pushing back on the Trump administration for cutting a deal to try to resurrect ZTE you have said you believe the death penalty for this company this telecommuting a Chinese based telecommunication company is in fact good policy why do you why was the Trump administration trying to negotiate a deal for ZTE why are they trying to prop up this company back up well Chuck ZTE in what way and essentially any Chinese telecom company is an arm of the Chinese Communist Party but let's put this decision in context for a year ZTE and Huawei rein while becoming ZTE became the fourth largest telecom company in the world when the president took office he began to change that and in fact earlier this year they issued an order that was essentially the death penalty on ZTE because it prevented them from getting access to critical American goods that they needed to do business Xi Jinping personally pleaded with him to negotiate it down to like without parole if you will I think the death penalty I think the death penalty is the right penalty for ZTE behavior and for their work with the Chinese Communist Party are you confident that the president won't veto essentially the the defense authorization bill this is what it would be linked to that he won't veto it over this I am Chuck the annual defense authorization bill contains the authorization for many critical programs that keep our country safe and support our troops and their families we have many months to get on this I'm pleased that 100 senators agreed with me on the threat that Z companies like ZTE and Huawei posed to America but we still have to negotiate with the house and then send it to the president for his signature what if there happens on this particular bill though the American people need to know that companies like ZTE and Huawei are threat to our national security and a threat to their privacy would you ever use a Z a phone that was had ZTE service and as Merkley wouldn't I hope you wouldn't either Chuck and in fact I've asked that question of every leader of our intelligence community in open hearings and not a single one have said that they would use it and in fact I said that's not really a fair question since you're all leading intelligence agencies what about members of your church or your family or your neighbors and they said they wouldn't recommend for anyone to use a ZTE or Huawei telephone or product well that does say a lot Senator Tom cotton Republican from Arkansas thank you sir for coming on sharing the views much appreciate it thanks Chuck hello youtubers if you're watching this it means you've checked out our channel so thank you now do me a favor subscribe by clicking on that button down there click on any of the videos to watch the latest interviews and highlights from MTV daily and MSNBC you get more Meet the Press content every morning and the first read newsletter if you're tired of content that you don't know anything about where it came from you don't have to have that problem with us NBC News MSNBC MTP and the Meet the Press mindset right here for you on youtube subscribe now
