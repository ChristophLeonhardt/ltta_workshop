<font color="#E5E5E5">forward to who trying to get it out of</font>

11
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:23,250
the way which was to eat some baby food

12
00:00:23,250 --> 00:00:26,820
<font color="#CCCCCC">sunday</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> chicken dinner now to wear all of</font>

00:00:35,910 --> 00:00:40,309
at one time without choking

16
00:00:50,310 --> 00:00:52,810
the only way I could describe that was

17
00:00:52,810 --> 00:00:58,780
eating<font color="#E5E5E5"> cold lumpy sick blue she make a</font>

18
00:00:58,780 --> 00:01:01,210
bubble each end and then you<font color="#CCCCCC"> twist them</font>

19
00:01:01,210 --> 00:01:05,560
like that<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay drinking some ketchup but</font>

20
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:08,020
I feel because it's a birthday normally

21
00:01:08,020 --> 00:01:10,030
you have a drink for someone so I'm

22
00:01:10,030 --> 00:01:12,070
gonna fill the rest of this with beer

23
00:01:12,070 --> 00:01:17,920
and you twist a unique fish yeah it's a

24
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:19,330
very thick beer I must admit when

25
00:01:19,330 --> 00:01:20,830
stirring it so I've got some fish

26
00:01:20,830 --> 00:01:28,360

30
00:01:53,119 --> 00:01:58,000
but I think this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a good attempt</font>

31
00:01:58,420 --> 00:02:00,500
compared to the other food challenges

32
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:04,930
