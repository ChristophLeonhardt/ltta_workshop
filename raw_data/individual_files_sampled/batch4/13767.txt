check it out keep your teeth clean it's great okay so let's start with the London terror attack because that's obviously a bigger international news than than what happened at Berkeley so in London as I say there was a terror attack it is not clear who perpetrated the terror attack as of yet I don't think that would be idle speculation to suggest that it is highly probable that this was some sort of Islamic terror cell the reason being that this is exactly in line with the sort of attack that Islamic terror cells have done in the past that could be wrong and as I say if it's wrong I'm happy to correct it but the fact is that we've had situations like this in the past in London just back in late October I believe there was a situation like this in which somebody tried to bomb the subway and it ended up being a guy who's a new convert to radical Islam according to the Sun Terre cops probing the Parsons green attack have no idea who detonated the bucket bomb that injured 29 so they've raised the number on rush hour tube train today the Met Police denied earlier reports that a suspect for the cowardly terror act had been identified using CC CCTV and you can see a picture of the bomb here this is what it looks like it's it's obviously got wires coming out of it whenever there's an explosion the first thing people think is is it Obama obviously this is pretty clearly a bomb so president Trump immediately takes to Twitter and begins tweeting things out so this is where you know I agree with Trump's general sentiment but I wish that he would wait for more information because he's the president I'm not and me speculating not quite the same thing as the president because the president has inside information and so people in Britain were a little upset with him because here's what he tweeted another attack in London by a loser terrorist okay fine he said these are sick and demented people who are in the sights of Scotland Yard must be proactive it's that second sentence that's a problem for some of the folks in London saying why are you giving away classified information on Twitter right how do you know that they were in the sights of Scotland Yard he says loser terrorists moppy's out must be dealt with in a much tougher manner the Internet is their main you main recruitment tool which we must cut off and use better yeah well I don't know what that means but sure and then he finishes by saying the travel ban into the United States should be far larger tougher and more specific but stupidly that would not be political politically correct me you should talk to the President of the United States about that you know somebody could actually promulgate an order like that look none of this is to rip on in Trump really because I think that trumps general sentiment which is that the West needs to get tougher on terror is obviously true and I've seen the left go nuts over these tweets again I think the critiques I just gave of the tweets are measured but real but they have not gone not to over Sadiq Khan who's the London Mayor who continues to go out there and say things like terrorists will not divide our community terrorists will not ruin our multicultural city again if that's your top priority in the aftermath of people nearly being murdered on your subway then I would suggest your priorities are not in order the fact is the reason that a lot of people trust Trump on terror is because it seems like his priorities are straight he's much much less worried about the sensitivities of the multicultural crowd than he is in finding killing imprisoning terrorists and that's what the government is there to do the government is not there to foster multiculturalism the government is there to protect your right to life and if they are not doing that they are not fulfilling their most basic duty so for all of the talk about how Trump is the bad guy today all I would say is that London has seen this is now the fifth major terror attack in London over the past nine months in the last 10 months four of those five were Islamic terror attacks and Tariq NAND and the head of the the London Mayor City Khan has done a pretty terrible job of tamping all of that down insofar as he has the power to do so okay so now to talk about the speech at Berkeley last night so to lead off I think that it's important to note a few things first of all there's a temptation on some parts of the left on some parts of the more radical left to immediately label everybody on the right a white supremacist Nazi to justify violence last night the City of Berkeley and Berkeley UC Berkeley spent six hundred thousand dollars on security for this event six hundred thousand dollars on security that's an enormous amount of money that 700 police officers out there lined up around the buildings they had state troopers on call day they basically showed up with a small army and the reason they did that is not because of me I'm not a particularly threatening fellow I haven't been in a fight since I was like 15 years old 16 years old okay the idea that I was gonna show up at Berkeley and start shattering windows uh Turley insane but in order for some members of the radical left to justify the sort of activity that they've been suing for the last year they have to declare that everyone who shows up in Berkeley who's slightly to the right of Glenn Greenwald must therefore be a terrorist Nazi sympathizer so one of the people who said this yesterday on Twitter was a guy named two Rican is she who considers himself an anti-racism activist Sarika she is also the dolt who put out an anti racism it was an anti racism organization with a logo that looked exactly like the swastika and everybody on Twitter started laughing at him and then he got sad and took it down anyway here is what he tweeted these we'd suspected white supremacist ben shapiro who tries to mask his racist rhetoric by claiming to be jewish is in Berkeley now hashtag Ben at Berkeley yeah there are a few things wrong with this wait suspected white suspected by whom of being a white supremacist by whom has he liked has anyone watched this show has anybody seen anything I've written for the past fifteen years like white supremacist what now and then he says that I love this I'm trying to race and mask my racist rhetoric am i claiming to be Jewish man what a long con I have going here I really played the part you know going home and not turning on my phone on Sabbath and keeping kosher and all that kind of it like boy I really I'm very sophisticated in this comics is the best way to mask your white supremacy is to wear a yarmulke and keep kosher for virtually your entire adult life that is the best way to do it that's the best way claiming to be Jewish really like that's how the thing Patricia Heaton tweeted back at him and she said I'm pretty sure he's actually Orthodox like he won't come to my Saturday night dinner parties until after sunset and he won't eat any of my food yeah but everybody's a white supremacist right this is the way it works everybody's white supremacist here are some pictures from the the the idiot left students who who wanted to who wanted to portray me as such yesterday so they put up a giant sign in the Student Union across the way from the building where I was speaking Zellerbach Hall and here's what it says it says we say no to your white supremacist BS we say no dear white supremacist BS which is weird since I don't really spout white supremacist BS and also I oppose white supremacist BS but it doesn't matter everybody's a Nazi everybody is a Nazi and why not then there are pictures of chalk right they were writing things like F the police F your donors you or free speech kills really who died yesterday anyone anyone if I had the power to kill people with my speech boy my life would be a lot better and also I would definitely be targeting people who are not at Berkeley like I'd start with Isis I started ice people were we're putting out F ben shapiro of course which is i mean frankly i heard that the office all the time so it's not that impressive also there's it's a free speech is not hate speech well I mean honestly should probably reverse that slogan hate speech is not free speech because otherwise doesn't make a lot of sense some free speech is aid speech and vice versa in fact there's no actual category of hate speech that's something that you make up there is hateful speech my favorite is the pretty butterfly that they put up there I really like the pretty butterfly but there are some people who also shocked on the ground Ben sharp hero is not welcome well if he can't get my name right I'm sure Ben sharp hero would be very hesitant to come to campus but I was not I was not particularly intimidated by your chokings I'm sorry but like what did they think that I was gonna look oh there's chalk ooh some of my favorite other other chokings were the head of the UC Berkeley the Chancellor of UC Berkeley's woman whom Carol Crist and that Carol Crist her last name is spelled precisely like Jesus Christ and so they were a bunch of slogans that were written down like Christ must go and I just thought that's gonna confuse a lot of people I mean I'm sure that tell a lot of people at Berkeley feel but that it's gonna confuse some people so the protesters showed up on mass and they had a lot of silly things to say so here are some of the protesters shouting after the police which is just a charming thing to say these are the people who the left says her you know a lot of the left says they're just wonderful and nice I mean they weren't violence of what they say is totally cool after the police okay so they're shouting at the cops and then this is my favorite the protesters started chanting speech is violence speech is violence okay so then it's funny cuz they seem to be engaging in speech right there but nobody was dying or being hit its speech is not violence you stupid people of course speech is not violence so because of all of this as I said in my speech yesterday the the fact is that the speech is violence crowd are the people who lend all the gas for the tank of an Tifa because Antipa says speeches violence therefore they get to show up and burn things when people come and talk which is just utterly asinine and 74 shows up where a lot of these people show up and there's some crossover between the two groups now I want to get to show you the security arrangements yesterday because they truly were unbelievable I do want to compliment Berkeley on their security arrangements I think that they made some mistakes as far as crowd control with regard to people coming into the building that's not the fault of the police but you know they they ruled out the top half of the auditorium we have over 3,000 people who wanted to come well over 3,000 people there a bunch of liberals who tried to claim tickets and then didn't show up and instead of handing those out to a standby line of 150 or 200 people the police instead seized the tickets so the room which wouldn't easily fit two thousand and we had three thousand people who wanted to come and end up being about eight hundred people instead which is the fault of the UC Berkeley administration but the security was really amazing and I'll show you some pictures in just a second but first I want to say thank you to our sponsors over at the u.s. concealed-carry Association so it's the middle of the night you hear glass shattering it's somebody at your front door and they're trying to break in you go to your safe you take out your gun here comes the the intruder and you shoot them that's the end of the story right well not so much because when the police arrived they don't shake your hand they put you in the police car to take you away they have to interview you interrogate you they may arrest you even if you did the right thing and that's why you need to know exactly what you should and should not say to the police it is the single most important thing you can discover today that could mean the difference between freedom and a jail cell even if you do the right thing especially if you do the right thing go to defend my family now doc and over its offend my family now calm you can claim your copy of the US CCA's free guide that will uncover the six things you didn't know what happened when the police arrived and it goes through all the things you need to know about what to tell the police about what you are likely to experience with the police the six things you didn't know what happened when the police arrived go over to defend my family now DICOM you get that for free it's like 160 pages of good advice defend my family now calm go over and check it out USC CA provides you all the protection that you need in case you actually have to god forbid use a gun in self-defense ok so I want to show you some of the security that UC Berkeley committed to and good for Berkeley good for Berkeley good for the PD I can tell you how speaking to one of the police officers yesterday and the police officers were basically saying we have been waiting to be unshackled by the politicians for well over a year we've been waiting for years to truly be told that we're allowed to do our jobs we've been waiting for it I got I mean there's one one police officer I spokes a bunch of police officers yesterday there's one police officer thank you to all the police officers who provided a safe secure place for free speech to flourish one of the police officers said I got to be honest with you like fancy 4 shows up I'm not gonna be disappointed because they were out in force ok this is some tape of just the police officers arriving to move around Zellerbach Hall the place where I was speaking look at this if you look at this hundreds and hundreds of police officers and an Tifa couldn't do anything right because all the police officers were there as well they should have been and tpho was stymied the police officers had been told that if they if they saw anyone with the masks they were to immediately arrest them also you're not allowed to carry weapons within a certain radius of the hall so there were nine arrests last night it's amazing the police is saying well there was no violence at this event last night it was a peaceful protest imagine if there have been nine people arrested at a tea party protest and what the headlines would have been it wouldn't have been peaceful protests or largely peaceful protests nine people were arrested last night and this was one of the arrests last night there is a what Berkeley side called a big kerfuffle a man shoved a woman and police immediately rushed in and arrested the guy there were nine people arrested I'll have to show you at some point the the clips the pictures of these people they're definitely from among life's winners there they're some of the saddest looking human beings that you have ever seen I hear is so the security was top-notch and it needs to be top-notch because this is what happens if you don't nip violence in the bud it grows and I hope that the security is just as good next week when the so-called free speech week shows up when when folks like Milo and Bannon and Coulter show up I disagree with them strenuously I think Milo as I've said many times is is a blot on the conservative movement because he's not particularly conservative and also because he's a provocateur and says some pretty terrible things but does he have free speech rights in Berkeley you bet your ass he does and I hope the police provide him and the rest of free speech week the same sort of protection that they provided me I assume that they're coordinating if they're not then then the police should make that clear but obviously if this is the sort of security that's necessary in order to preserve a free speech at Berkeley this is the sort of security that's necessary until it's no longer necessary it has become largely necessary again because what auntie Phil likes to do is they hide in crowds there these terrorist tactics they hide among civilians and then when the time is ripe they pull a mask over their face rush out do violence and rush back into the crowd and then they take off the mask and they take off their jacket and then it's hard to identify them the police were told right away if there's a problem you grab them and that's exactly what happened there's no violence the speech went off just fine and the speech itself I think was it was fun I enjoyed it here's a I'll show you a couple of clips from the speech you can go to our YouTube page or we have posted it and you can watch the entire thing there are over a hundred thousand people watching it in live time last night simultaneously it already has well over half a million views here is a little bit of the beginning of the speech where I talk explicitly about antiva thanks to Antipa and the supposed anti-fascist brigade for exposing what the radical left it truly is all of America is watching because you guys are so stupid it's horrifying i am grateful and you can all go to hell you pathetic lying stupid jackasses so yeah i didn't hold back on them particularly but i also went after the alt-right a little bit later in the speech so the media is funny there's some folks on the Left who continue to maintain that I'm alright which again you have to be an insane person to believe this you have to be functionally illiterate to believe this but I did spend some time going after the all right because that's the right thing to do because all right white supremacism is idiotic and evil but I think the the clip that is the most popular today is this clip of me debating abortion with one of the with one of the students oh we don't sorry we don't have that one if you want to see that one then you're gonna have to go over to our YouTube page it's on our Facebook it's on our Twitter it's going viral so you should go check that one out because that one's very popular maybe we'll play it on Monday so we'll make sure that we have it then but please go over to our face but it's a good reason to subscribe to our YouTube channel go over and subscribe to our YouTube channel and you can go see that particular clip how frustrated what are the folks at Auntie feh well this video is going around I hope it's real maybe it's fake but if it's not I hope it's real of a black bloc guy trying to lift up a trash can because he wants to hurl it through a window he neglects to see that the thing is bolted down to the cement since stupid and that was pretty much a good summary of an tyfa's night last night I do love that there was apparently some girl who's asked by a member of the media about counseling and here's what she said she said just taught this is Sofia Lee so young I think this is pronounced and she is a journalist for the for world mag she said just talked to a Berkeley freshman who said she'll be seeking counseling after been at Berkeley event she's not attending his speech yeah unfortunately that's how it goes at Berkeley but I think that it was a really valuable event I think it showed the country that we can have civilized discourse that we can all come out against violence that we can all rip white supremacy together that there are still points of unity in this country and that you do have to let the police do their jobs if you wish to have a civilized society you can't let violent people run around and then praise them as though they're doing says that the Heroes of Normandy when the fact is that they are nothing but a bunch of street thug morons okay so what Berkeley thing was it was a great I hope it was an optimistic point for people is an optimistic point for me I think was an optimistic point for a lot of folks right left and center who may disagree with a lot of the things that I say but recognize that there still rights to say things with which I disagree on and even on places like like Berkeley campus okay other news so Chelsea Manning is embroiled once again in controversy and Chelsea Manning I do love this story just a little bit Chelsea Manning was invited by Harvard to be a Kennedy School Fellow okay to be a Kennedy School Fellow which I don't know why Chelsea Manning wasn't upset about the misgendering because Chelsea man is in a visiting fellow Chelsea Manning isn't a fellow Chelsea Manning is a woman don't you know so anyway it was announced that this convicted traitor to the United States was going to be a visiting fellow at Harvard and immediately a bunch of people resigned their positions at Harvard over a bunch of the other fellows including Mike Marella former CIA director he said listen I've served this country this person undermined our country and is a traitor I'm not gonna be called the visiting fellow if this person's gonna be called a visiting fellow so Harvard walked it back they said we still want Chelsea Manning to speak which is totally fine I think that's appropriate and then they said but we're not gonna say that this person should be a fellow because it's too much of an honorific and there's been some blowback on it so we're not gonna do that hey here is what the Dean his name is Elmendorf the Dean of the Harvard Kennedy School had to say about he said we invited Chelsea Manning to spend a day at Kennedy School specifically we invited her to meet with students and others who are interested in talking with her and then to give remarks in the forum where the audience would have ample opportunity as with all of our speakers to ask hard questions and challenge what she has said or done fair enough on that basis we also named Chelsea Manning a visiting fellow we did not intend to honor her in any way or to endorse any of her words or deeds as we do not honor or endorse any fellow ok that's nonsense hey I've been called I've had fellowships at particular institutions before I was for example a publius fellow over at Claremont Institute okay that was an honorific of course it's an honorific they were idiots to give an honorific to Chelsea Manning I speak on campuses all the time without honorifics okay it wasn't like they called me a UC Berkeley visiting fellow last night I was just a guy who came to speak okay and Chelsea Manning is just a guy who came to speak who is proclaimed a woman by the media Chelsea Manning it was very upset about this and tweeted in all emojis I mean if you watch Chelsea Manning's Twitter feed one of the amazing things is when you see somebody who's that gifted when the use of emojis I know the first thing you think is I wish I could take a class from that person at Harvard Kennedy School of Government I really wish that that person would educate me in the use of hieroglyphics because clearly this is a person who's got it all together but I'll read you Chelsea Manning's tweets in just a moment first I want to say thank you to our sponsors over at up side so I travel an awful lot and when we travel here at the Ben

you're a woman then why is your Twitter handle XY Chelsea which technically means that you're a man at one point I'm gonna have to go through a full explanation for why biological men are biological men and my biological women are biological woman but I assumed everyone had taken fifth grade biology in any case Chelsea Manning tweeted out honored to be first disinvited trans woman visiting Harvard fellow and then it's a weird sad / happy emoji they Cho marginalized voices under CIA pressure sunglass emoji rainbow emoji heart emoji hashtag we got this genius I can't I mean as a graduate of Harvard Law School who went there because I got 176 on my LSAT out of 180 and had an graduated summa cum laude from from UCLA I know then when I think intellectual caliber I think heavy-duty intellectual caliber I think Chelsea Manning Chelsea Manning and then Chelsea Manning tweeted so Harvard says Sean Spicer and Corey Lewandowski bring something to the table and add something to the conversation and not me and then these the sunglass emoji rainbow emoji heart emoji hashtag we got this I don't understand what we got this is supposed to mean and I don't understand what all those emojis are supposed to mean maybe Chelsea Manning is just too sophisticated this is why I need a classic Chelsea Manning an emoji use okay so am i a big fan of Sean Spicer or poor Lewandowski particularly no but they do bring something to the table they are not traitors they're not traitors to the United States okay I don't like Corey Lewandowski but Corey Lewandowski didn't leak American military secrets to WikiLeaks which was then apparently utilized by terror groups that's it they've got to step up on you dude I mean like really that's let's be frank about this okay Chelsea Manning would still be in prison if it were not for the fact that Chelsea Manning is trans that is legitimately the only reason that Chelsea Manning is out of prison right now the the opposition to Chelsea Manning then Bradley Manning began long before Bradley Manning identified as a woman it began with the fact that Bradley Manning was leaking American military secrets thousands of pages of American military secrets to the Russian front group WikiLeaks okay that is that is why people were angry and now after the trans stuff that Obama tell we have to let Chelsea Manning out because Chelsea Manning's a hero a trans hero everybody's a hero medal medal of honor and now she in and now Chelsea Manning is saying that they're not bringing Chelsea Manning because Chelsea Manning's a trans woman no I would guarantee you that Harvard Kennedy has had trans women speak therefore as fellows before if they have not I bet they will in the near future I I went there okay if you think that the the nonsense the nonsense propaganda about transgenderism does not dominate at Harvard you're out of your mind of course it dominates at Harvard but apparently Harvard is now some retrograde conservative bastion incredible to me since I spent three years there not one day and I guess I just don't understand because I don't understand why there's a rainbow emoji in a sunglass emoji and a hashtag we got this everybody's a child it's all childish nonsense okay in other news from President Trump continues to receive blowback from the right over his daca deal apparently one of the things that's happening here is the John Kelly Trump's chief of staff is basically limiting his access to the news treating him like a small child not allowing him to view opposing points of view because it puts Trump in a bad bad mood and then he his opinion so he hasn't seen that Ann Coulter is really going after him I mean Ann is just on a rampage against President Trump she's saying now that she wasn't conned she says that that Trump is a horse who didn't win place or show even if she said yesterday that maybe he ought to be impeached she said this guy is like a couch he picks up whatever the person sitting on him is wearing so whatever hit was his audience wants him to say he says which is why some of us have been concerned okay I like that and I've been friend friendly with Ann for 17 years I've known Ann since I was 16 years old you know Ann is a very charming person when Ann says that some of us have been concerned like listen I'm glad that Ann has a standard she has more of a standard than a lot of people on the right who backed Trump just because he's Trump but when she says this is why some of us have been concerned she wrote a book called in Trump we trust that was the name of the book eeep ler abyss awesome okay all the people who say they weren't conned you got to feel a little bit conned right I mean they were there pumping that we had to trust from you know Trump was the guy that we had to follow Steve King who again another person who I've met and and I think Steve King's a nice guy but Steve King was blasting Trump up with all big Trump supporter very early on congressman from Iowa here is Steve King blasting Trump over the wall last night on CNN so you heard him right big beautiful wall and then today it's gonna come later and now it's about a renovation is the wall ever gonna happen we were gonna have the Rolls Royce of a big beautiful wall the first the first section of that is inspiring to me to hear that hearin the second part kind of says that the Rolls Royce is now going to be an overhaul jalopy yeah that's pretty brutal from Steve King there Tucker Carlson said the same thing he said first of all points to anybody who uses the word jalopy Tucker says no reason that he has no reason to be optimistic about President Trump on this deal so Tucker doesn't trust him either the president seems confident it will all work out in the end but there's no reason to be optimistic the fate of daca recipients is by far the best piece of leverage he has or ever will have if he gives it away for free none of his other immigration priorities the priorities he ran on and won the presidency with will even be considered all those border security measures hearing about their ridiculous they mean nothing they haven't worked and in any case they'll be rolled back instantly the next time a Democratic president wins if this president doesn't get funding for a wall now it will never be built period okay so I mean tucker is going after really hard there and for a reason okay John Podesta who hates Trump right John Podesta was Hillary Clinton's campaign manager and he's out there and all of his weirdness saying that it's great that Trump wants border protection we'd give him that we'd love to give him some new border protection for sure John Podesta last night he met with the two leaders they struck a deal and he should push forward with it more border security in exchange for making dock a permanent and that would be good for those young people it would be good for the country and I think a majority of the public would support that okay so it's pretty obvious that the Democrats are getting what they want out of President Trump and president Trump is being given some bad advice on all of this he continues to maintain that he is going to that he's going to push forward with this deal don't worry there will be a wall later now is it is he gonna lose his base over this I don't think he is I really don't think the President Trump is gonna lose his base over this and the reason I don't think that he's gonna lose his base over this is because I think that there are a lot of people who are our follow-the-leader when it comes to President Trump there's a study very interesting study that came out recently by a couple of people named Michael Barbara and Jeremy Pope at Brigham Young University and here's what they said they said there are there are a large number of party loyalists in the United States their claims to being a self-defined conservative our suspect group loyalty is the much more profound motivator of opinion than are any ideological principles they found that liberal cues from Trump moved Republicans in a liberal direction more so than conservative cues from Trump moved Republicans in a conservative direction how big was the effect when Trump went to the left more than 15% in a liberal direction due to it from cue that means that when Trump goes lefty on immigration a bunch of his base will follow him in fact they've measured how flexible the base was on various on various issues the base was least flexible on guns and abortion those were the two issues where they were least flexible they were the most flexible on immigration and climate change and those are the issues and immigration particularly is the area where Trump is now is now moving so will he lose his base I think that it's a mistake to look at Steve Bannon or Ann Coulter or Tucker Carlson and say these are the people who are demonstrative of the fact that Trump's gonna lose his base I don't think that Trump is gonna lose his base over this and I think Trump knows it which is not a good thing right this is the problem with with not following ideas following people instead okay so I quickly want to say thank you to our friends over at tracker comm so one of the things I definitely did not have to worry about when I was headed up to Berkeley is losing my keys the reason I didn't have to worry about losing my keys is because I have a tracker on my keys the tracker device is a coin size device you stick it on your keys you can put it in your wallet and it beeps when you alert it from your phone so you never have to lose your keys again you never have to spend half an hour looking for keys then you're late to your appointment because of it it's it's really helped my marriage because my wife loses her keys and her phone particularly a lot it works in Reverse too by the way one of the cool things about the tracker program is that if you hit the track or button and you don't know where your phone is and your phone is on silent we've all had this problem the tracker program overrides that and rings anyway it rings your phone even if your phone is on silent which is just terrific because how many times have you lost your phone and then you can't find it you're trying to ring it with somebody else's phone you can't that that's what the ring there that's what sorry tracker is for that's what tracker does tracker has changed everything with the all new tracker pixel and you won't have to worry about losing anything ever again go to the tracker comm the track arrghh comm

your life is just significantly better in every single way okay time for some things I like and some things that I hate and then we'll get to the mailbag so quickly a thing that I like to been doing Disney movies all like this one is a charming film it has what Walt Walt Walt Disney called his favorite single shot in the history of all of his films in Cinderella here is a little bit of the preview you will have only to the stroke and the spell will be broken and everything will be as it was before it's like a dream a wonderful dream come true Cinderella is that in the area you tend to think of her as pretty milquetoast character Cinderella but in this film she gets kind of sassy with the step with the stepmother a little bit and it's it's rather charming it's a single favorite shot which we didn't show in this preview is there's the shot where she's wearing her torn dress because the stepsisters and stepmother of torn up her dress and then the fairy godmother shows up and you see the magical bolts come from her wand and it goes all the way up and around her dress and then it comes down and when it comes down she's wearing a new dress and that was Walt Disney single he said that was a single favorite shot in all of his movies so that's kind of a cool thing okay yeah there it is we can show that that shot that's that's anything um so here's the shot can we play that yeah there we go this shot it's a beautiful shot very cool so okay other things that I like when Tucker Carlson dismissed an aunt Eva professor who was apparently half giraffe on his show and it was pretty amazing here was Tucker going after a person who must be in the Guinness Book of World Records for longest neck in human history I mean this is it's pretty press if it makes you think that Lamarckian evolution versus Darwinian evolution is real then one day he saw a tree outside his house wanted to eat from and just stretched but here is here is Tucker Carlson going up against an Antipa professor these rights know my position is that communities have the right to defend themselves against groups that actively seek to eliminate members of that community to defend themselves against violence or violence I mean we were talking about it but no but physical violence so fucking about a history a group that has a history like we're just we're we're suddenly in this a historical world where we're not killing roof or way Michael Page doesn't exist where I unders Breivik doesn't exist are you kidding me no are you really a professor by the way what does Richard Spencer have a right to speak in public Richard Spencer is a danger to society when he speaks in public what he is doing he is publicly recruiting people to his very violent movement very violently so does he have a right to speak in public I don't think he has a right to speak in public unopposed and that is ultimately what the purpose of an Tifa is is to show and oppose him but it's not opposition you shut people down you prevent them from speaking and you commit violence against them I know a number of people don't tell me I know people have been knocked down and beaten by people from antifa so that is true it does happen we have it on tape we just roll the tape so you're saying is that justified yes I believe that communities have the right to defend themselves against threats to them serve their community ideas they don't like no explicitly said that they want to eliminate those people from our society even inflating you're conflating violence with ideas no if I raised my hand to strike you you have no right to straight you have to be put in order to raise your hand to strike me you have to think that you're gonna strike me and when you when you are going out in public as a protester explicitly saying that you want to eliminate most of the people from this country I believe most of the people in this country have the right to say no that's not okay okay but it's you're absolutely right to say it's not okay what you don't have a right is to prevent me from saying what I think even if you disagree and you definitely don't have a right to commit violence against me and you're blurring the lines there and by the way don't you work at a criminal okay you don't have the right to do that you have the right to make a character but eventually this professor and went loping off to the savanna to to graze with the rest of the herd so Tucker Carlson went on Safari and and bagged himself a giraffe so oh I want to talk about some things that I hate and then we'll do the mailbag but first you

subscribe to youtube watch you can watch the videos from Berkeley last night all of them are interesting and good now so go check that out we are the largest conservative podcast in the nation okay time for a couple of quick things I hate that we'll do some mailbag so the first thing that I hate is there's a host who is a named Anthony Bourdain and Anthony Bourdain I am not a fan of I think his show is not good he goes around to various places and taste their food and talk about how wonderful book culture is and generally their food is garbage and so as their culture in any case here is Anthony Bourdain and he was talking in he was talking in some weird way about what he would feed to president Trump and he was cornered by TMZ I guess and he was asked what he would serve Trump at North Korean dictator Kim jong-un at an imaginary peace summit and here's what he had to say if Trump and Kingdra moon you're gonna have a bit of a summit to find men relations and they want to do Takeda whoa disturb him walk okay hemlock and then he says he's joking hemlock of course is poison so he'd poison both of them well what a what a charmer he is because trumping him jungling are exactly the same yet another CNN host you can't contain himself right on the heels of Kathy Griffin with her beheaded trump mask good times okay other things that I hate Floyd Mayweather came out yesterday and he was praising Trump's with what they called locker room talk during the campaign he said it's great because he speaks like a real man he speak like a real man spoke romance be like man she had a fetter see yeah I had to squeeze her at a great I had to grab a fat right here I was talking to him privately about grabbing the ground but just so he talking like I mean to talk I'm in black room talk mmm I'm a man I'm saying you know I am bi great about me so I think that we should all be concerned when Floyd Mayweather is complimenting the presidents of the United States on his manliness Floyd Mayweather in a five-month span in 2001-2002 pled guilty to two counts of battery domestic violence in November 2003 he was arrested and charged with two counts of battery for allegedly fighting with two women at a Las Vegas at a nightclub he was later convicted of misdemeanor battery ordered to serve a hundred hours of community service according to the AP one of the accusers testified that Mayweather punched her on the cheek and then punched another woman on the back of her head as used to her she tried to help in December 2011 he pled guilty to one count of misdemeanor battery domestic violence no contest to two counts of harassment for hitting the mother of three of his children now how many kids he has or how many mothers they have he was sentenced to 90 days in jail and released after 60 when Floyd Mayweather is complimenting you on your manliness let me suggest that you're doing something wrong okay it's that simple okay time for some mailbag so let's jump right in James says I've seen a lot of Millennials make the argument that conservatives have outdated morals do morals get outdated or is this just an excuse for the left to engage in moral relativism it's definitely an excuse for the left to engage in moral relativism the the idea that morals become outdated morals are based on the on the vagaries of human nature on the evils of human nature and morals do not become outdated just because you think that you have come up with a reason not to engage in the morals now does not say that morality has not the way people see morality has not evolved obviously I mean slavery was a thing in virtually every society up until the last 200 years that's one way in which morality evolved but to say that all morality is outdated you need to explain if you're gonna change a moral you need to explain why the moral needs to be changed and really what is the inherent value in the morality itself so as I've said before I think that the G K Chesterton line here about morality is is pretty much right but if we're seeing the right and the left is that when it comes to changing morals for example think of the think of offense that you find in the middle of a field the left the person from watt says this fence has no reason to be there I may as well just get rid of it the person on the right says listen until I'm not gonna let you get rid of it until you explain to me why it's there in the first place think why an institution is there in the first place and then think whether you should get rid of it you need to understand why something is there in the first place I don't think that conservatives have quote-unquote outdated morals I do think that that is an excuse for the most part by people not to evolve morality but to get rid of it entirely in favor of what they think is moral as a religious person I couldn't think otherwise I mean I think there is such a thing as an eternal God who creates an eternal an internal moral code for for human beings Ryan says hey Ben with all that's going on in the debt ceiling debate would you please clear this up for my friends in me does the debt ceiling give the government permission to spend money or doesn't give the government permission to pay back money it has already borrowed thanks Ryan so it gives them it gives the government permission to borrow more money to pay off the money that it's already borrowed okay so so government is in debt right and we have to pay off the debt well how do we pay off the debt we can't just raise taxes and take people's money without an active legislature the debt ceiling allows the government to borrow more money in order to pay off the money that it's already borrowed sell more bonds in order to pay it's basically think of it this way you have a credit card you have a credit card bill that's due you don't have any cash in the bank what do you do you go find a 0% APR credit card you transfer the balance from your first credit card to the 0% APR credit card and then you try and make a living and then pay it back that's what the debt ceiling really is so does the debt ceiling have to get raised it has to get raised unless you're going to immediately cut expenditures but is it also something that should be used as a leverage point in order to cut future government spending I believe it is Jacob says what is your view on the privacy versus security debate and how do you feel about the sentiments of tradition being used to fill voids in the Constitution well you know when it comes to filling voids in the Constitution my general view is that you have to rely on the people of the United States to fill those voids as opposed to trying to rewrite the Constitution in the name of your own personal values like Jacob suggests Griswold versus Connecticut and Bowers V Hardwick and roe v wade Griswold versus Connecticut which is a ruling that says that contraceptive use is a private thing and therefore it's protected by the Constitution there's two questions you're asking one is constitutional question and one is a question about how I feel personally about privacy versus security I don't think the state has a role in regulating what you do inside your bedroom that's not the same question as whether the Constitution prohibits a state from invading that space and the answer to that is that the Constitution is silent about whether a state can ban contraceptives for unmarried couples for example so that means that the state can do that under the Constitution now you may have a state constitution that says differently but this is why and a republic you have a legislature if you don't like that policy elect people to over overturn that policy Nathan says hey Ben my wife and I have been trying to have a baby for some time it looks like we'll need to go the route of IVF my concern is that part of the IVF process is fertilizing a significant number of eggs which means we'll either need to have many babies or eventually destroy the excess fertilized eggs I'm not sure if the moral thing to do here is I'm extremely pro-life but also pro a happy wife thoughts well here's my thought you know IVF is morally complex because the obvious intent is to create a child might kill one but if you believe that life begins at conception then that means that you are better off from moral point of view using in vitro to fertilize say as many babies as you're willing to have at one time and then some of them will implant some of them won't but what you shouldn't do is is you know if fertilized certain number of eggs and then kill something off purposely because you don't want to use those eggs now that seems to me to be a serious moral quandary Daniel says do you think all great empires or civilizations fall for the same reason if America ceases to exist at some point in the future what do you think would be the primary factors of the downfall well no they don't no fail to exist for the same reason but reality basically hits all civilizations and depending on how the civilization is constructed it hits the civilization in a different way if America ceases to exist I think the primary factor in the downfall would probably be the overreaching government the overreaching federal government that sees fit to in all of our lives and all of our money and all of our property ownership and all of how we run our businesses I think that will cause the collapse because people will simply not want to abide by those rules Josh would say hey Ben I'm a nerve how do you feel about asking for the father's permission before proposing Thanks okay so if your fiancee wants you to do it do it I feel I have to say this is one area where I may have changed my opinion because I am I'm now father so it is that sort of change things I remember my wife really wanted me to ask her dad's permission as a traditional thing because her dad is Moroccan Israeli and she thought it would mean a lot to him and I really was was annoyed with it because it's like you're old enough to get married what happens if he says no he doesn't know I'm still marrying you so what's the point of this little charade but as a sign of respect I think it's probably a good idea so you should probably do it Daniel says hey Ben if you have to choose a country to live in that wasn't the USA or Israel where would you choose to live well I mean I really only want to live in the United States I think that Australia I like english-speaking countries to be honest with you Australia Canada Great Britain Italy some beautiful country I really like Italy a lot Italy is a really pretty country there are there a lot of but I have to have to admit that my I'm not the most well-traveled person I've been to England and I've been to I've been to France and I have been to Italy but that is about it outside of the continental United States and in Hawaii I also I was in Israel for my wedding okay let's see Clayton says do you think religious leaders should openly share their personal political views on specific issues or candidates on platforms like Facebook and Twitter or is that unethical well I don't think it's unethical I think that it's actually good to know where people stand politically what I do think is unethical is for religious leaders to actually hide the religious point of view on political issues that is unethical the whole point of religion is to help promulgate values politics have a values intersect very often and if you are hiding politics in religion in order to not alienate some of your group that's because you're doing a bad job as a religious leader Thomas says should new parent such as myself be worried about sending our young children to public schools pending the recent news of gender swapping indoctrination and other far-left ideals that seem to be growing in the public education system is private or homeschooling the way to go listen I've always felt the private or homeschooling is the way to go if you can afford it or if you can spend time there been a good public schools by the way I went to public school that was really great called Edison Elementary School in Burbank I went to one that was not as great called Walter Reed in North Hollywood but I'm not saying that all public schools are equally bad but I would obviously be worried about the the way that the public school system is run with respect to the values it promulgates jackson says hey Ben do you believe there's a way for people in sports to protest what they believe without it being seen as disrespectful by the public yes don't attack general symbols with which we all agree there are plenty of ways for sports figures to come out and say listen I think that this is an injustice and then we all go okay alright well that's what you think that's fine but when you kneel for the national anthem that is a symbol of unity for the United States when you kneel at the sight of the flag that's a symbol of unity and there's nothing to the sports or not sports I would suggest however that you know if you if you are a sports figure and you want to get political you should know that comes the cost because you are stepping outside your area of expertise just as if I were to step into the sporting world I wouldn't expect a kobe bryant would allow me to sink jumper after jumper without blocking me okay the fact is that's not my venue politics is my venue if you're a sports person you step into my venue you're on my turf now Brad's has been what is your next book about you know what I'm gonna save that one because I'm working on a proposal let's say I'm hoping that it will be my magnum opus it's sort of my broad view of life and the decline of the West so if that titillates you then prepare yourself it'll be ready in 16 years no I should be having I should be making that proposal pretty quickly and then I'll tell you all about it as soon as that is clear okay so we finally made the weekend long week guys but we will be back here on Monday with much much more I believe I'm off the end of next week is the end of next week is Rosh Hashanah so it'll be a bit of a truncated week for me on that and so make sure you're here on Monday to get all of the news I'm Ben Shapiro this is the Ben Shapiro show
