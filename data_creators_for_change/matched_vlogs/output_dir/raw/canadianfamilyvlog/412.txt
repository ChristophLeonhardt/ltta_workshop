11
00:00:33,190 --> 00:00:36,010

12
00:00:36,010 --> 00:00:39,309
I'm late<font color="#CCCCCC"> for freaking co-op I have a</font>

00:00:48,010 --> 00:00:50,409
factoring inside I thought<font color="#E5E5E5"> it was like</font>

17
00:00:50,409 --> 00:00:53,079

know how to add and subtract multiply

21
00:01:02,890 --> 00:01:05,000
