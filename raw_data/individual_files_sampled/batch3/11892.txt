another news terrorists and rebels occupying the enclaves of Eastern Goethe just outside the capital Damascus have reportedly started fighting each other that's according to the Russian reconciliation center for Syria it says the infighting began after one of the rebel groups was urged to separate from al-nusra terrorists in exchange for negotiations on conditions for their safe passage out of the war ravaged area earlier the reconciliation center struck a deal with rebels with some rebels which allowed 52 civilians half of them children to safely leave the enclaves through a humanitarian corridor it's the first time civilians have been able to use the corridor there as intended previously they were either fired at by militants or resorted to using a using a passing aid convoy as cover and this is what the situation there looks like now the Syrian government has regained a large portion of eastern goota as you can see essentially isolating the militants into three separate pockets and civilians who lived in these territories under militant rule are now sharing their stories two RTG gajadhar offers more now on the deal that allowed dozens of civilians to leave the fighting militants in control of the area have led them out almost two weeks after Russia and Syria opened humanitarian corridors not an act of goodwill on behalf of the rebel factions but part of a deal Russia and Syria led some anti-government fighters safely flee with their families and in exchange fighters in gutte would allow 50 civilians to leave the war zone as well we've been suffering horribly for seven years we all stayed neutral in Misrata but we couldn't leave couldn't do anything they didn't let us leave controlled and put pressure on us we haven't seen any of the AIDS sent to us we haven't seen any money nothing they took everything from us militants treat civilians in East gouta as a bargaining chip making sure that if anyone flees they do it on the fighters terms the gloves were off from the start the Russian Defense Ministry has reported that the paths to safety were shelled almost religiously precisely to prevent anyone from fleeing to Damascus trying to escape the Hellfire between the government forces and militant groups whose fighters far too often side with terrorists you have all sorts of needs inside water today the priority remains medical help that we need to reach with people inside water and food aid as well gunfire on TV ooh la la la la la Manny Larkin well as Europe without the surge it Kirra a diagonal Savita key the new buster he reacted in a banana Tasha mushy beautifully uh Kelly Mumper hope adem√°s Lucinda Hey what they said about FEMA ten years reactor ministries I'm sorry Ralph clapping good luck doula political analyst ali ibrahim says the infighting between militants in eastern guter is caused by the lack of choice they have amid serious anti-terror operation there I think because of the pressure of the military pressure of the Syrian army which could size about 60% of the total area of the occupied territories of the Estrin Goethe I think that brusha passed those militants to look for other choices one of these choices is to go out of of Goethe to a blip or some of them want to surrender because there's an amnesty decree released by President Assad for those militants who want to stop fighting the state so this kind of disagreement and because of the narrow range of choices for those militants at this point the fighting began to take place between those militants
