00:00:08,919 --> 00:00:09,585
>> WHAT ABOUT THE

2
00:00:09,586 --> 00:00:10,319
ATTORNEY GENERAL JEFF SESSIONS?

3
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:13,589
>> WE WILL SEE WHAT HAPPENS COME

MIDTERMS --

5
00:00:13,991 --> 00:00:15,324
>> BUT EVERYBODY THINKS --

6
00:00:15,325 --> 00:00:16,926
>> I WAS DISAPPOINTED THAT HE

7
00:00:16,927 --> 00:00:19,328
RECUSED HIMSELF, AND MANY PEOPLE

8
00:00:19,329 --> 00:00:20,863
THINK I WAS RIGHT ON THAT.

9
00:00:20,864 --> 00:00:23,799
>> Martha: NEWS TONIGHT, IS

10
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:24,533
ATTORNEY GENERAL JEFF SESSIONS

11
00:00:24,534 --> 00:00:25,267
NOW RESPONDING TO PRESIDENT

12
00:00:25,268 --> 00:00:28,337
TRUMP'S LATEST DIG ON HIM?

13
00:00:28,338 --> 00:00:31,307
AND RESPONDING TO THE LATEST

14
00:00:31,308 --> 00:00:32,041
ROUND OF CRITICISM AT A DOJ NEWS

15
00:00:32,042 --> 00:00:33,709
CONFERENCE.

16
00:00:33,710 --> 00:00:36,245
>> HE'S BEEN FRUSTRATED BY MY

17
00:00:36,246 --> 00:00:38,481
RECRUITERS

18
00:00:38,482 --> 00:00:39,348
RECUSAL, BUT WE HAVE BEEN SO

19
00:00:39,349 --> 00:00:44,587
PLEASED AND HONORED TO BE GIVEN

20
00:00:44,588 --> 00:00:46,155
THE RESPONSIBILITY TO USE HIS

21
00:00:46,156 --> 00:00:48,290
AGENDA AT THE DEPARTMENT OF

22
00:00:48,291 --> 00:00:49,892
JUSTICE.

23
00:00:49,893 --> 00:00:52,194
I AM PLEASED AND HONORED TO HAVE

24
00:00:52,195 --> 00:00:54,096
THAT RESPONSIBILITY, AND I WILL

25
00:00:54,097 --> 00:00:55,031
DO SO AS LONG AS IT'S

26
00:00:55,032 --> 00:00:58,567
APPROPRIATE FOR ME TO DO SO.

27
00:00:58,568 --> 00:01:01,470
>> Martha: JIM JORDAN OF OHIO,

28
00:01:01,471 --> 00:01:03,172
A MEMBER OF THE HOUSE JUDICIARY

29
00:01:03,173 --> 00:01:03,973
COMMITTEE, CONGRESSMAN, GOOD TO

30
00:01:03,974 --> 00:01:05,141
SEE YOU TONIGHT.

31
00:01:05,141 --> 00:01:06,542
THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE.

32
00:01:06,543 --> 00:01:07,943
IF YOUR REACTION.

33
00:01:07,944 --> 00:01:10,312
YOU'VE BEEN VERY CRITICAL OF THE

34
00:01:10,313 --> 00:01:11,080
ATTORNEY GENERAL.

35
00:01:11,081 --> 00:01:11,747
I THINK THE ATTORNEY GENERAL

36
00:01:11,748 --> 00:01:16,085
DOESN'T THINK PEOPLE FOCUS

37
00:01:16,086 --> 00:01:17,453
ENOUGH ON THE WORK THEY ARE

38
00:01:17,454 --> 00:01:17,920
DOING.

39
00:01:17,921 --> 00:01:20,423
>> ROD ROSENSTEIN IS IN CHARGE

40
00:01:20,424 --> 00:01:21,557
OF THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT, NOT

41
00:01:21,558 --> 00:01:23,325
JEFF SESSIONS, AND IS ALSO

42
00:01:23,326 --> 00:01:24,593
OBVIOUS THAT THE PRESIDENT IS

43
00:01:24,594 --> 00:01:26,395
GOING TO BE LOOKING FOR A NEW

44
00:01:26,396 --> 00:01:27,329
ATTORNEY GENERAL.

45
00:01:27,330 --> 00:01:28,531
I THINK THAT'S PRETTY CLEAR.

46
00:01:28,532 --> 00:01:29,331
MY GUESS THAT WILL HAPPEN

47
00:01:29,332 --> 00:01:31,534
SOMETIME IN THE NOT-SO-DISTANT

48
00:01:31,535 --> 00:01:31,867
FUTURE.

49
00:01:31,868 --> 00:01:33,736
JEFF SESSIONS IS A GOOD MAN, A

50
00:01:33,737 --> 00:01:35,504
GOOD SENATOR, BUT I THINK IT'S

51
00:01:35,505 --> 00:01:37,373
THE PRESIDENT OF THE

52
00:01:37,374 --> 00:01:40,576
UNITED STATES WANTS AN

53
00:01:40,577 --> 00:01:43,212
ATTORNEY GENERAL WHO WILL

54
00:01:43,213 --> 00:01:44,313
CONDUCT MATTERS DIFFERENTLY, AND

55
00:01:44,314 --> 00:01:46,749
I THINK THAT WILL HAPPEN IN THE

56
00:01:46,750 --> 00:01:48,284
NOT-TOO-DISTANT FUTURE.

57
00:01:48,285 --> 00:01:49,085
>> Martha: VERY CRITICAL OF

58
00:01:49,086 --> 00:01:49,685
ROD ROSENSTEIN, AS WELL.

59
00:01:49,686 --> 00:01:54,390
HE'S BEEN TRYING TO GET THE DOJ

60
00:01:54,391 --> 00:01:55,124
TO TURN OVER A LOT OF DOCUMENTS.

61
00:01:55,125 --> 00:01:56,392
THE PRESIDENT FEELS FOR NOW HE'S

62
00:01:56,393 --> 00:01:57,927
OFF THE HOOK.

63
00:01:57,928 --> 00:01:59,195
ARE YOU OKAY WITH THAT?

64
00:01:59,196 --> 00:02:01,530
>> NOW, I'M NOT OKAY WITH THAT.

65
00:02:01,531 --> 00:02:03,933
WE SUBPOENAED FOR THE MEMOS, WE

66
00:02:03,934 --> 00:02:04,734
HAVEN'T RECEIVED THOSE.

67
00:02:04,735 --> 00:02:07,036
WE ASKED FOR THE AUGUST 2ND MEMO

68
00:02:07,037 --> 00:02:10,339
OF 2017 WHERE ROD ROSENSTEIN

69
00:02:10,340 --> 00:02:11,607
ALTERED THE SCOPE OF SPECIAL

70
00:02:11,608 --> 00:02:12,241
COUNSEL ROBERT MUELLER'S

71
00:02:12,242 --> 00:02:12,675
INVESTIGATION.

72
00:02:12,676 --> 00:02:15,745
HE WON'T LET US SEE THAT.

73
00:02:15,746 --> 00:02:17,613
WE'VE ASKED FOR BRUCE OHR'S

74
00:02:17,614 --> 00:02:20,015
THREE OH TWOS, AND HE WON'T LET

75
00:02:20,016 --> 00:02:20,916
US SEE THOSE.

76
00:02:20,917 --> 00:02:23,719
ON TOP OF ALL THAT, HE WAS A

77
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:24,420
NO-SHOW LAST WEEK WHEN HE WAS

78
00:02:24,421 --> 00:02:26,155
ASKED TO COME IN AND GIVE US

79
00:02:26,156 --> 00:02:28,090
ANSWERS UNDER OATH AND NOW

80
00:02:28,091 --> 00:02:30,326
TODAY, A KEY PLAYER IN THIS

81
00:02:30,327 --> 00:02:32,027
WHOLE AFFAIR TOOK THE FIFTH.

82
00:02:32,028 --> 00:02:34,463
SO NO, I HAVE AS BIG A BEEF WITH

83
00:02:34,464 --> 00:02:36,899
ROD ROSENSTEIN AS I DO WITH JEFF

84
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:38,134
SESSIONS BECAUSE ROD ROSENSTEIN

85
00:02:38,135 --> 00:02:39,235
IS THE ONE MAKING IT DIFFICULT

86
00:02:39,236 --> 00:02:41,737
TO DO OUR JOB AS A SEPARATE BUT

87
00:02:41,738 --> 00:02:43,105
EQUAL BRANCH OF GOVERNMENT.

88
00:02:43,106 --> 00:02:44,707
>> Martha: 'S ROD ROSENSTEIN'S

89
00:02:44,708 --> 00:02:45,407
ATTORNEY DISAGREES WITH YOU,

90
00:02:45,408 --> 00:02:48,310
WHICH I'M SURE IT IS NOT A BIG

91
00:02:48,311 --> 00:02:48,677
SURPRISE.

92
00:02:48,678 --> 00:02:51,180
TALKING ABOUT YOU GUYS, WATCH.

93
00:02:51,181 --> 00:02:55,885
>> THIS COMMITTEE HAS LARGELY

94
00:02:55,886 --> 00:02:59,088
CONDUCTED ITS BUSINESS THROUGH

95
00:02:59,089 --> 00:03:00,289
SECRET, CONFIDENTIAL INTERVIEWS,

96
00:03:00,290 --> 00:03:02,892
BINDING WITNESSES AND THEIR

97
00:03:02,893 --> 00:03:04,727
COUNSEL, TO SILENCE, WHILE THE

98
00:03:04,728 --> 00:03:06,195
MEMBERS WALK OUTSIDE TO ALL OF

99
00:03:06,196 --> 00:03:08,998
YOU, THE MEDIA, AND THE PUBLIC,

100
00:03:08,999 --> 00:03:10,299
AND SELECTIVELY LEAK FROM THOSE

101
00:03:10,300 --> 00:03:12,201
INTERVIEWS TO TELL YOU WHAT THEY

102
00:03:12,202 --> 00:03:15,070
WANT YOU TO HEAR.

103
00:03:15,071 --> 00:03:16,672
>> Martha: THUS GLENN

104
00:03:16,673 --> 00:03:17,406
SIMPSON'S ATTORNEY VERSION OF

105
00:03:17,407 --> 00:03:18,874
THIS.

106
00:03:18,875 --> 00:03:20,476
>> GLENN SIMPSON TOOK THE FIFTH

107
00:03:20,477 --> 00:03:20,776
TODAY.

108
00:03:20,777 --> 00:03:22,077
YOU TAKE THE FIFTH IF YOU

109
00:03:22,078 --> 00:03:23,279
BELIEVE YOU HAVE SOME KIND OF

110
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:24,713
CRIMINAL LIABILITY.

111
00:03:24,714 --> 00:03:26,115
THAT'S THE ONLY REASON YOU TAKE

112
00:03:26,116 --> 00:03:26,482
THE FIFTH.

113
00:03:26,483 --> 00:03:28,450
I THINK THAT'S WHY HE DID THAT,

114
00:03:28,451 --> 00:03:31,287
BECAUSE OF HE'S DOING IT JUST TO

115
00:03:31,288 --> 00:03:32,288
OBSTRUCT A CONGRESSIONAL

116
00:03:32,289 --> 00:03:33,055
INVESTIGATION, THAT'S WRONG, IS

117
00:03:33,056 --> 00:03:33,355
ALSO.

118
00:03:33,356 --> 00:03:35,691
I THINK HE DID IT BECAUSE HE'S

119
00:03:35,692 --> 00:03:36,725
CONCERNED ABOUT CRIMINAL

120
00:03:36,726 --> 00:03:37,092
LIABILITY.

121
00:03:37,093 --> 00:03:39,295
TO SAY THAT WE ARE THE PROBLEM?

122
00:03:39,296 --> 00:03:39,895
REMEMBER WHAT HAPPENED.

123
00:03:39,896 --> 00:03:42,865
THE CLINTON CAMPAIGN HIRED GLENN

124
00:03:42,866 --> 00:03:45,067
SIMPSON WHO THEN WENT OUT AND

125
00:03:45,068 --> 00:03:46,435
HIRED A FOREIGNER AND THE WIFE

126
00:03:46,436 --> 00:03:48,637
OF A TOP JUSTICE DEPARTMENT

127
00:03:48,638 --> 00:03:51,941
OFFICIAL TO PRODUCE THE DOSSIER

128
00:03:51,942 --> 00:03:53,108
THAT THEY THEN FUNNELED TO BRUCE

129
00:03:53,109 --> 00:03:55,110
OHR WHO GAVE IT TO THE FBI, WHO

130
00:03:55,111 --> 00:03:56,512
THEN WENT TO THE SECRET COURT SO

131
00:03:56,513 --> 00:03:58,948
THEY COULD GET A WARRANT TO SPY

132
00:03:58,949 --> 00:04:00,149
ON PRESIDENT TRUMP'S CAMPAIGN.

133
00:04:00,150 --> 00:04:02,117
AND THEY ARE ACCUSING US OF

134
00:04:02,118 --> 00:04:04,153
WRONGDOING FOR TRYING TO GET

135
00:04:04,154 --> 00:04:05,287
ANSWERS FOR HOW THAT ALL TOOK

136
00:04:05,288 --> 00:04:07,289
PLACE CUSTOMERS THAT IS JUST

137
00:04:07,290 --> 00:04:07,690
RIDICULOUS.

138
00:04:07,691 --> 00:04:10,459
HE TOOK THE FIFTH BECAUSE HE'S

139
00:04:10,460 --> 00:04:11,327
CONCERNED ABOUT CRIMINAL

140
00:04:11,328 --> 00:04:12,161
LIABILITY AND I THINK JOHN SAID

141
00:04:12,162 --> 00:04:14,029
THIS A COUPLE DAYS AGO AND SAID

142
00:04:14,030 --> 00:04:16,131
IT WELL, ONE THING TO ONE

143
00:04:16,132 --> 00:04:19,101
COMMITTEE, AND ANOTHER WITNESS

144
00:04:19,101 --> 00:04:21,102
FOR OUR COMMITTEE, THE JUDICIARY

145
00:04:21,103 --> 00:04:22,671
COMMITTEE, WHO SAID EXACTLY THE

146
00:04:22,672 --> 00:04:23,038
OPPOSITE.

147
00:04:23,039 --> 00:04:24,506
THAT'S WHAT HE MOST LIKELY TOOK

148
00:04:24,507 --> 00:04:25,040
THE FIFTH TODAY.

149
00:04:25,041 --> 00:00:00,000
>> Martha: THE WIFE OF BRUCE
