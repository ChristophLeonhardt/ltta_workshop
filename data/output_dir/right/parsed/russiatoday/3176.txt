with the passion over Catalan
independence having apparently cooled
off Madrid is now taking precautions to
ensure things stay that way the Spanish
government has introduced an unusual ban
in Barcelona targeting the city's
fountains a bounch yellow because it
means freedom for our political
prisoners it is the color of freedoms
this seems silly to me because yellow is
just the normal color I think it's a
desperate campaign by politicians trying
to stop the independence movement that
very often is complete nonsense
it's pointless everybody has already
decided how they will vote on 21st and
that won't change by seeing yellow or
another color
I mean I'm broke you know they banned
yellow but another color could be used
that's just absurd
