yeah we're on a mission from God
this terrible shirt I sleep in this
terrible shirt
seven days a week because when Francine
wakes up and she sees this she smiles
just because I don't put my roads in
every episode doesn't mean I don't run
every day because I do and I'm going for
a run
right now days when you exercise it's
easy to eat healthier on days when you
don't exercise you see garbage all day I
don't get that running its cheeseburgers
and no shakes I was looking at old
footage yesterday and I saw some video
footage of this studio from last summer
here's the thing about this studio this
place I built this place from the ground
up this studio this is like my sanctuary
this is where I work this is where I
make things this is my happy place is
just mean here this is my tree fort this
place is like a physical manifestation
of Who I am
whoo and as I was looking at that old
footage in that video it was a macula
tin here this place was perfect all the
time and now and now it's like this
claustrophobic dump in here I've got no
one to blame for the current state of
affairs but myself I guess I've just
been prioritizing making videos over
taking care of the studio and those two
things really are mutually exclusive I
should not be decoupling them I also
just keep telling myself as soon as the
new space is ready as soon as the news
but the new space is ready it is
magnificent over here the white lights
are up right now that's why it's so
clean and white in here but look how
nice this is this place is ready for
work there have been a lot of haters
questioning the integrity of this loft
this is sound especially when
considering this is only a storage loft
nobody see me working up here if
anything this loft was wildly over built
there's
that this is gonna fall out and anyone
beneath it like it would take something
bigger than an earthquake in order for
this to think I mean that's just basics
big night tonight tonight
date night we don't get date night often
cuz it's like it's hard to get a
babysitter and then we just like our
nights with the bait but tonight is date
night I'm very excited about it we're
seeing some sort of movie about grocery
stores or a produce or something like
that it's gonna be great
unless Han
are you excited about about date night
which part of date night I don't know
you don't seem very enthusiastic
what's wrong with your stomach these are
control top genes
what does that mean means like spanks

blessed if you like that kind of thing I
personally would like a larger you don't
want to do it no more babies well one
I'm getting old and two this whole Zika
thing is like maybe stereo channel yeah

this episode to get so personal I do I
want another baby but Zika scary it's
really scary
I was literally eating dinner in that
one square mile zone that's like on the
CDC do not travel to area in Miami
do you mean when we broke up once
because you told me to sit up straight
hey you should so straight you sit like
a slouch we're not there just after
three green lights so we're gonna walk
Kandice eyes on her walking shoes
how are your feet
sleeping my cat like getting a charley
horse you want to piggyback everything's
in there thank you
nobody interesting here at all
what's up being okay
when you come these things the snacks
are free but it's usually just like it's
not all the snacks like tonight it looks
like beer and popcorn yourself
no way they put us together assigned
seating but they put us with friends
tonight which is great sitting next to
Gabe we've been working on this movie
for like ten years it's been a real
passion project for us which I
acknowledge is weird for a movie about a
talking hot dog but that's the reality
of my life but this is sausage party you

fast to wrote an entire movie it's a
problem he's very talented I can't film
