1
00:00:00,720 --> 00:00:04,230
I thought I understood how the loans were
gonna work when I started, and

2
00:00:04,230 --> 00:00:07,060
it's talking about the interest that's
accruing every day.

3
00:00:07,060 --> 00:00:09,780
Right.
So, that's a little scary to look at.

4
00:00:09,780 --> 00:00:14,240
At the same time that college has become
more important, it's become so

5
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:16,770
much more expensive and complicated than
it used to be.

6
00:00:16,770 --> 00:00:19,390
Yeah.
And, it, it, it is just not possible for

7
00:00:19,390 --> 00:00:23,280
the parents to be able to finance you
know, a,

8
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:25,944
a bunch of kids all at the same time.

9
00:00:25,944 --> 00:00:29,862
And, and that's where, society's just
gotta make an investment.

10
00:00:52,547 --> 00:00:58,049
I have the honor and the pleasure of
introducing, President Barack Obama.

11
00:00:58,049 --> 00:00:58,932
Hello Atlanta.

12
00:01:01,881 --> 00:01:06,877
The reason I want to come here today is
because I believe that higher education,

13
00:01:06,877 --> 00:01:11,501
as you believe is one of the best
investments that anybody can make in their

14
00:01:11,501 --> 00:01:12,120
future.

15
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:14,390
We're trying to make sure that across the
board, more and

16
00:01:14,390 --> 00:01:16,640
more young people can afford to go to
college, and

17
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:21,930
then afterwards, aren't so burdened with
debt that you can't do anything else.

18
00:01:21,930 --> 00:01:23,950
We're, we're gonna try something new.

19
00:01:23,950 --> 00:01:27,050
It doesn't involve new spending or
bureaucracy.

20
00:01:27,050 --> 00:01:32,510
It's just a simple organizing principle,
that I want all of us to sign on to.

21
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:34,530
A declaration of values.

22
00:01:35,540 --> 00:01:41,010
What I'm calling a Student Aid Bills of
Right, a Student Aid Bill of Rights.

23
00:01:41,010 --> 00:01:45,870
And it says, every student deserve access
to a quality affordable education.

24
00:01:45,870 --> 00:01:49,680
Every student should be able to access the
resources to pay for college.

25
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:53,670
Every borrower has the right to an
affordable repayment plan.

26
00:01:53,670 --> 00:01:58,160
Every borrower, has the right to quality
customer service, reliable information,

27
00:01:58,160 --> 00:02:02,370
and fair treatment even if they struggle
to repay their loans.

28
00:02:02,370 --> 00:02:06,660
It's a simple set of principles, that if
everybody signed onto,

29
00:02:06,660 --> 00:02:12,070
it can focus our attention into one simple
basic idea, which is, make sure

30
00:02:12,070 --> 00:02:15,710
that when you're doing the right thing
that you're society has got your back.

31
00:02:18,610 --> 00:02:19,550
Thank you, everybody.

32
00:02:19,550 --> 00:02:20,070
God bless you.

33
00:02:21,823 --> 00:02:25,187
Thank you.

34
00:02:36,313 --> 00:02:37,033
Hello, everybody.

35
00:02:37,033 --> 00:02:38,141
Hi.

36
00:02:38,141 --> 00:02:38,798
You got your crew here.

37
00:02:38,798 --> 00:02:39,842
We do, we do.

38
00:02:39,842 --> 00:02:41,305
We have our great students right here.

39
00:02:41,305 --> 00:02:42,536
How are you?

40
00:02:42,536 --> 00:02:43,372
Gabriel.

41
00:02:43,372 --> 00:02:45,113
Gabriel?
Nice to see you man.

42
00:02:45,113 --> 00:02:46,065
Good to see you.

43
00:02:46,065 --> 00:02:46,947
Hi how are you.

44
00:02:46,947 --> 00:02:48,201
Hi I'm Meyers.

45
00:02:48,201 --> 00:02:49,502
Good to see you.

46
00:02:49,502 --> 00:02:50,337
Hey how you doing?

47
00:02:50,337 --> 00:02:50,941
What's your name?

48
00:02:50,941 --> 00:02:51,800
Antoine.

49
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:52,659
Good to see you Antoine.

50
00:02:52,659 --> 00:02:53,774
Good to see you too.

51
00:02:53,774 --> 00:02:54,796
Alright.

52
00:02:54,796 --> 00:02:55,492
Hi I'm Laura.

53
00:02:55,492 --> 00:02:56,467
Hey Laura.
Good to see you.

54
00:02:56,467 --> 00:02:57,396
So how's it goin everybody?

55
00:02:57,396 --> 00:02:58,162
It's goin all right.

56
00:02:58,162 --> 00:03:03,320
So, today, I've, I have been focused on
college affordability,

57
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:06,570
which is I assume is on everybody's minds.

58
00:03:06,570 --> 00:03:07,720
Yeah
Yeah

59
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:08,840
Didn't you just

60
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:10,580
pay off your loans in 2004.

61
00:03:10,580 --> 00:03:11,100
Yes.

62
00:03:11,100 --> 00:03:13,790
2000, basically the year I was elected to
Senate.

63
00:03:13,790 --> 00:03:15,500
The year before I became a US Senator,

64
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:20,270
was when we when we finished paying off
all of our loans.

65
00:03:20,270 --> 00:03:24,180
Combined, Michelle and mine bill was
higher than our mortgage.

66
00:03:24,180 --> 00:03:29,840
And, right now student debt, is actually
higher than credit card debt.

67
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:32,870
Over 40 million people currently with
student debt.

68
00:03:32,870 --> 00:03:34,060
Yeah.
So this is a,

69
00:03:34,060 --> 00:03:36,194
a massive generational challenge.

70
00:03:36,194 --> 00:03:39,370
Yeah
There are all kinds of

71
00:03:39,370 --> 00:03:40,940
things that we can do.

72
00:03:40,940 --> 00:03:44,820
But it's gonna require cooperation between
the states, who have to put more money

73
00:03:44,820 --> 00:03:49,020
into it, the federal government, who have
to think about how we can

74
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:56,560
lower the debt burden and make sure it's
managed better the student.

75
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:00,940
And the parents who are gonna have to be,
get, be better consumers and so

76
00:04:00,940 --> 00:04:04,000
a lot of what we're trying to do is like,
know before you owe.

77
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:08,400
And figure out how to, you know, for
example graduate on time.

78
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:11,460
One of the things students think about is,
oh, I'll take five years,

79
00:04:11,460 --> 00:04:12,740
I'll take fewer credits.

80
00:04:12,740 --> 00:04:17,740
Not thinking about the fact that, if
you're not out in four years, you know,

81
00:04:17,740 --> 00:04:20,649
each, each semester that you're taking,
you know,

82
00:04:20,649 --> 00:04:23,170
that's just more debt so that's important.

83
00:04:23,170 --> 00:04:26,720
And then, working with the schools to
partner with community colleges, and

84
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:27,610
even partner with high schools,

85
00:04:27,610 --> 00:04:29,640
because you guys have already taken some
college courses, right?

86
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:30,260
Yes.
Yes, sir.

87
00:04:30,260 --> 00:04:32,680
I read a little bit about your, each of
your backgrounds.

88
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:37,530
Give me a a sense of sort of how you think
about affording college, maybe we'll start

89
00:04:37,530 --> 00:04:40,695
with the folks who are already in school
now and how you're thinking about debt.

90
00:04:40,695 --> 00:04:43,220
Did you feel like, you had enough
information.

91
00:04:43,220 --> 00:04:44,910
Cuz I, I know from Michelle and

92
00:04:44,910 --> 00:04:47,390
my perspective, we didn't have a lot of
guidance going in.

93
00:04:48,390 --> 00:04:51,130
We had to kinda make it up as we went
along.

94
00:04:51,130 --> 00:04:53,470
How have things gone for you guys
generally?

95
00:04:53,470 --> 00:04:56,140
We were talking, Laura and I, about, about
this earlier.

96
00:04:56,140 --> 00:05:00,340
Yeah, so when I was in high school, I'm
from Sarasota, Florida.

97
00:05:00,340 --> 00:05:04,390
And there really wasn't much guidance as
far as how to prepare for

98
00:05:04,390 --> 00:05:06,585
college besides, you know, take AP
classes.

99
00:05:06,585 --> 00:05:07,250
Right
That kind of thing.

100
00:05:07,250 --> 00:05:07,760
Right.

101
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:11,110
So, my senior year, I pretty much got like
a game plan down.

102
00:05:11,110 --> 00:05:12,610
Yeah.
I applied for

103
00:05:12,610 --> 00:05:17,720
about 50 scholarships my senior year, and
I wrote about 70 essays.

104
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:18,840
Yeah, it was pretty crazy.

105
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:19,850
Yeah, it is.
It was like,

106
00:05:19,850 --> 00:05:22,150
it was hard to keep up good grades while
doing that.

107
00:05:22,150 --> 00:05:23,050
I can only imagine, yeah.

108
00:05:23,050 --> 00:05:24,610
Yeah and.

109
00:05:24,610 --> 00:05:25,700
How did that turn out?

110
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:27,530
It actually turned out really well for me.

111
00:05:27,530 --> 00:05:30,880
But my little brother is currently going
through the same thing that I went through

112
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:31,860
as a senior.

113
00:05:31,860 --> 00:05:33,240
He's really struggling.

114
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:35,230
So, it probably won't be the same for him.

115
00:05:35,230 --> 00:05:37,770
Yeah. Yeah. Well, that was pretty
enterprising of you to,

116
00:05:37,770 --> 00:05:41,050
to have that ability to go out there and
find it on your own.

117
00:05:41,050 --> 00:05:44,470
So I would say my situation is very
similar to yours, as unfortunately,

118
00:05:44,470 --> 00:05:47,860
I have a few scholarships pay my way
through school right now, so.

119
00:05:47,860 --> 00:05:48,640
That's great
So

120
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:50,150
yeah
That's why you got a smile

121
00:05:50,150 --> 00:05:51,520
on your face
Yeah

122
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:52,360
That's outstanding.

123
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:55,550
I just wanna see like, I guess me
personally wanna see that,

124
00:05:55,550 --> 00:05:57,400
that opportunity like, I guess.

125
00:05:57,400 --> 00:05:58,580
Available for everybody
Right.

126
00:05:58,580 --> 00:06:01,400
Available for everybody
So how about, how about for you?

127
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:05,280
I'm from Georgia, so I had the
opportunity,

128
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:09,160
if I stayed in state, to receive the Zell
Miller Hope scholarships.

129
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:09,660
Exactly.

130
00:06:09,660 --> 00:06:13,810
That's for high school students who keep a
certain grade point average and

131
00:06:13,810 --> 00:06:15,880
it's financed by the Georgia lottery,
right?

132
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:16,660
Yes.

133
00:06:16,660 --> 00:06:17,162
Yeah.
So,

134
00:06:17,162 --> 00:06:21,306
my first year in college I had a
combination of student loans and

135
00:06:21,306 --> 00:06:23,348
the Zell Miller scholarship.

136
00:06:23,348 --> 00:06:27,813
My parents have been also taking out
private loans from 401K to help pay for

137
00:06:27,813 --> 00:06:32,218
my school so I'm gonna have some debt to
pay off afterwards, for sure.

138
00:06:32,218 --> 00:06:35,635
Are there other issues that you think
would have helped you or

139
00:06:35,635 --> 00:06:39,462
that surprised you when you were going
through this whole process?

140
00:06:39,462 --> 00:06:42,866
I thought I understood how the loans were
gonna work when I started, and

141
00:06:42,866 --> 00:06:46,655
they said, you won't have to start paying
off your loans until after school.

142
00:06:46,655 --> 00:06:48,690
Mm-hm
And

143
00:06:48,690 --> 00:06:52,440
I get email quarterly that update me on
what my loan status is,

144
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:55,440
and it's talking about the interest that's
accruing every day.

145
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:57,660
Right.
So, it's a little scary to look at, too.

146
00:06:57,660 --> 00:06:58,390
Yeah.
Yeah.

147
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:02,640
Now, Michelle'd spoken to your school,
right?

148
00:07:02,640 --> 00:07:03,517
Yes.
Was she well behaved?

149
00:07:05,050 --> 00:07:06,280
She, she didn't cause a ruckus?

150
00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:07,040
No.

151
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:08,490
Okay, I wanna make sure.

152
00:07:08,490 --> 00:07:12,240
And then part of her message was
encouraging folks to know how to

153
00:07:13,420 --> 00:07:15,960
apply to schools, have a, have a,

154
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:20,080
a broader range of schools that they were
looking at, knowing what's possible.

155
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:22,640
So you guys are just going, about to go
through this process.

156
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:25,008
How, how, how are you thinking about it?

157
00:07:25,008 --> 00:07:29,976
And so, honestly, like, I've always been
that top student, so academics is easy.

158
00:07:29,976 --> 00:07:34,880
And I have a Presidential scholarship, but
with the cost of living, room and

159
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:37,897
board, tuition, and extra fees it's still,

160
00:07:37,897 --> 00:07:42,370
it's almost no putting a dent in the
financial piece of what I need.

161
00:07:42,370 --> 00:07:45,000
And so, it's almost like scholarships
don't matter.

162
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:48,500
And also, Antoine you were talking about,
you know, you got a great scholarship.

163
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:52,073
Yeah, yeah.
So I have, I'm an oldest of six children.

164
00:07:52,073 --> 00:07:54,650
Mm-hm.
I have younger siblings like directly

165
00:07:54,650 --> 00:08:00,440
behind me, one year, two year and they
plan on attending college as me, as well.

166
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:04,330
And I, fortunately I have a scholarship
and I, I will be attending college.

167
00:08:04,330 --> 00:08:07,570
But the question is, like, how would they
able to attend?

168
00:08:07,570 --> 00:08:09,430
Right.
Back to back in a two year span?

169
00:08:09,430 --> 00:08:10,870
Right.
You know, for

170
00:08:10,870 --> 00:08:14,010
families like yours where you've got a
bunch of kids and,

171
00:08:14,010 --> 00:08:16,450
you know, mom who's working, maybe dad's
not in the home.

172
00:08:16,450 --> 00:08:20,290
You know, that's how it was for me, I had
my grandparents who were helping.

173
00:08:20,290 --> 00:08:25,273
It, it is just not possible for the
parents to be able to finance you know,

174
00:08:25,273 --> 00:08:27,550
a bunch of kids all at the same time.

175
00:08:29,210 --> 00:08:32,820
And, and that's where society's just got
make an investment.

176
00:08:32,820 --> 00:08:37,309
At the same time that college has become
more important, it's become so

177
00:08:37,309 --> 00:08:39,719
much more expensive and complicated than
it used to be.

178
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:43,508
Yeah.
And for most people your parent's age.

179
00:08:43,508 --> 00:08:44,948
Mm-hm.

180
00:08:44,948 --> 00:08:49,830
You know, the cost particularly of an
in-state school was pretty modest.

181
00:08:49,830 --> 00:08:52,700
You might have a little bit of debt but by
the time you came out,

182
00:08:52,700 --> 00:08:55,980
it was the kind of debt that you could pay
off in a year, maybe two years.

183
00:08:55,980 --> 00:08:57,180
And that shifted.

184
00:08:57,180 --> 00:08:58,090
Two things happened.

185
00:08:58,090 --> 00:09:04,520
One was that state legislatures,

186
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:10,250
significantly cut back on their support
for state universities and colleges.

187
00:09:10,250 --> 00:09:15,150
So all of these things have changed that
make it more challenging for all of you.

188
00:09:15,150 --> 00:09:18,310
And that's part of why what we've done,
is, first of all,

189
00:09:18,310 --> 00:09:20,710
cut out the banks from the student loan
program.

190
00:09:20,710 --> 00:09:22,670
So that the money is going directly to
students.

191
00:09:22,670 --> 00:09:29,280
That left more money for to For Pell
Grants and, and things like that.

192
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:32,890
Now what we're doing is we're spending a
lot of time working with colleges to have

193
00:09:32,890 --> 00:09:34,790
figure out how you keep costs down.

194
00:09:34,790 --> 00:09:39,590
And how do you make sure students coming
in know what they're going owe?

195
00:09:39,590 --> 00:09:43,940
Because one of the big problems is that
university will recruit.

196
00:09:43,940 --> 00:09:44,773
And say don't worry.

197
00:09:44,773 --> 00:09:45,283
Mm-hm.

198
00:09:45,283 --> 00:09:45,864
Yeah.

199
00:09:45,864 --> 00:09:46,537
You'll be fine.

200
00:09:46,537 --> 00:09:47,884
You don't hear anything about it.

201
00:09:47,884 --> 00:09:51,869
But you don't know what, and then in your
excerpt interview, as you're about to

202
00:09:51,869 --> 00:09:55,244
leave, somebody in the financial aid
office says, oh, by the way-.

203
00:09:55,244 --> 00:09:55,825
Here's your bill.

204
00:09:55,825 --> 00:09:58,564
Interest has been accruing, here's how
much debt you got,

205
00:09:58,564 --> 00:10:00,724
here's what your monthly payment looks
like.

206
00:10:00,724 --> 00:10:01,467
Right.

207
00:10:01,467 --> 00:10:03,417
And it's challenging.

208
00:10:03,417 --> 00:10:08,549
One of the things that I proposed this
year was, making community colleges free.

209
00:10:08,549 --> 00:10:13,292
For a lot of students the community
colleges is the pathway even to get into

210
00:10:13,292 --> 00:10:14,911
a four year university.

211
00:10:14,911 --> 00:10:15,578
Right.
And

212
00:10:15,578 --> 00:10:19,601
if you can make that free then they can
transfer credits, and then the fewer

213
00:10:19,601 --> 00:10:23,567
classes you have to take at the four year
institution which is more expensive,

214
00:10:23,567 --> 00:10:26,390
you know, the less that you're gonna have.

215
00:10:26,390 --> 00:10:30,210
It may turn that your siblings, some of
them, if they don't get scholarships,

216
00:10:30,210 --> 00:10:33,500
may have to use this community college
route first.

217
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:35,800
It's still gonna be a good investment for
them though.

218
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:41,730
There is a difference of about $28,000 a
year, between

219
00:10:41,730 --> 00:10:45,430
the average salary of somebody who's a
college grad and somebody who's not.

220
00:10:45,430 --> 00:10:47,340
I mean, it's a huge spread.

221
00:10:47,340 --> 00:10:51,550
So even if you're taking on debt, it's
still gonna pay off.

222
00:10:51,550 --> 00:10:55,390
Previous generations, they had no debt.

223
00:10:55,390 --> 00:10:59,230
And as a consequence, earlier on they
could start buying a home, or

224
00:10:59,230 --> 00:11:00,019
they could start a business.

225
00:11:00,019 --> 00:11:00,580
Mm-hm.
Yeah.

226
00:11:00,580 --> 00:11:03,240
You know, they were just able to save
money.

227
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:06,510
And for my generation, even, but

228
00:11:06,510 --> 00:11:11,180
certainly the folks coming behind me, a
lot of folks, you know,

229
00:11:11,180 --> 00:11:14,140
they're in their 40s and they've still got
loans that they're paying on,

230
00:11:14,140 --> 00:11:18,890
which means that, you know, where that
money could have been used for

231
00:11:18,890 --> 00:11:22,420
them to start a, start a life, you know,
might have been different.

232
00:11:22,420 --> 00:11:23,990
I have a question, if I'm allowed.

233
00:11:23,990 --> 00:11:24,930
Of course.

234
00:11:26,218 --> 00:11:27,305
America used to fund,

235
00:11:27,305 --> 00:11:30,870
you were mentioning a well, the states
used to fund education a lot more.

236
00:11:30,870 --> 00:11:34,200
America used to fund education a lot more.

237
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:40,280
And now, we have a system where the
government actually makes money off of,

238
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:42,420
of the federal wealth.

239
00:11:42,420 --> 00:11:46,660
How do we get back to funding education
and,

240
00:11:46,660 --> 00:11:49,710
off the money that in many cases has
already been spent.

241
00:11:49,710 --> 00:11:51,220
Well, couple things I'd say.

242
00:11:51,220 --> 00:11:54,878
First of all, at the state legislative
level, governors and

243
00:11:54,878 --> 00:11:59,380
state legislators have to understand that
probably the most important

244
00:11:59,380 --> 00:12:03,696
competitive advantage they now have is the
quality of their workforce.

245
00:12:03,696 --> 00:12:04,555
Mm-hm.

246
00:12:04,555 --> 00:12:10,479
So you are defeating yourself if you're
cutting back on education spending,

247
00:12:10,479 --> 00:12:14,340
and it's important for higher education.

248
00:12:14,340 --> 00:12:15,620
But they used to know that.

249
00:12:15,620 --> 00:12:16,420
What happened?

250
00:12:16,420 --> 00:12:22,230
Well, part of what happened was the, the
no tax mentality locked in.

251
00:12:22,230 --> 00:12:27,090
Once you started capping revenues, at the
same time

252
00:12:27,090 --> 00:12:31,030
as things like three strikes are out,
criminal laws we've got into place.

253
00:12:31,030 --> 00:12:35,410
Now you've got a huge demand for more
prison cells.

254
00:12:35,410 --> 00:12:40,720
That money starts getting siphoned off
into a different place.

255
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:43,040
Healthcare costs start going and

256
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:46,930
fairness to a lot of states they had to
figure out how to pay for Medicaid.

257
00:12:46,930 --> 00:12:50,980
So all those dollars start moving away
from higher education.

258
00:12:50,980 --> 00:12:55,560
And you know, the idea of charging tuition
and

259
00:12:55,560 --> 00:13:00,110
putting the burden back on the user, the
student, that became the,

260
00:13:00,110 --> 00:13:02,380
the path of least resistance from a lot of
universities.

261
00:13:02,380 --> 00:13:05,890
Now, you can make that up, by raising
taxes.

262
00:13:05,890 --> 00:13:09,160
But once again it comes down to the
choices that we make as a society.

263
00:13:10,260 --> 00:13:15,220
Do we think this is important enough that
we want to make that investment.

264
00:13:15,220 --> 00:13:17,910
And I think we should.

265
00:13:17,910 --> 00:13:20,410
Not everybody's gonna have to have a
four-year degree.

266
00:13:20,410 --> 00:13:23,590
But everybody's gonna have to have
something about what

267
00:13:23,590 --> 00:13:24,820
they were doing in high school.

268
00:13:26,350 --> 00:13:32,940
Unless, you know, unless you're Lebrun
James, or, you know, or Kanye.

269
00:13:32,940 --> 00:13:35,000
Anyone have a last question for the
President?

270
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,060
Suddenly, we're out of time.

271
00:13:36,060 --> 00:13:40,550
I was just wanting to know what you were
hoping to get from talking to students

272
00:13:40,550 --> 00:13:41,078
in Atlanta.

273
00:13:41,078 --> 00:13:47,060
You know the, I'll be honest with you,
some of it's completely selfish on my part

274
00:13:47,060 --> 00:13:52,420
when I talk to you guys I, I I get
inspired.

275
00:13:52,420 --> 00:13:57,388
You know, I get excited about what the
future holds because, you know, I'm,

276
00:13:57,388 --> 00:13:58,180
I'm now 53.

277
00:13:58,180 --> 00:14:00,440
Malia's starting to look at colleges now.

278
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:02,390
So I've got a little bit of perspective.

279
00:14:02,390 --> 00:14:07,240
And when I talk to you guys I, I, I get
inspired.

280
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:10,270
You know, I, I get excited about what the
future holds.

281
00:14:10,270 --> 00:14:11,400
The world's in good hands.

282
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:14,070
We got, we got a next generation of people
who are gonna do great stuff.

283
00:14:14,070 --> 00:14:17,010
And that makes me encouraged.

284
00:14:17,010 --> 00:14:18,590
You guys, you guys encourage me.

285
00:14:18,590 --> 00:14:20,058
Thank you.
All right?

286
00:14:20,058 --> 00:14:21,777
Thank you, Mr. President for taking the
time.

287
00:14:21,777 --> 00:14:22,334
I enjoyed it.

288
00:14:22,334 --> 00:14:23,007
Thank you.

289
00:14:23,007 --> 00:14:24,075
You guys want to take a picture together?

290
00:14:24,075 --> 00:14:25,445
Yes.

291
00:14:25,445 --> 00:14:27,790
Just, just so you can send it to mom.

292
00:14:27,790 --> 00:14:28,440
Oh, yeah.

293
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:30,640
Hey mom.

294
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:33,061
All right, everybody say cheese.

295
00:14:33,061 --> 00:14:33,561
Cheese.

296
00:14:35,247 --> 00:14:37,662
When she selects nuance it's, you know?

297
00:14:37,662 --> 00:14:38,162
Cheese.

298
00:14:42,213 --> 00:14:43,211
We good?
Okay, we got it.

299
00:14:43,211 --> 00:14:43,722
Thank you.

300
00:14:43,722 --> 00:14:44,332
Fantastic.

301
00:14:44,332 --> 00:14:47,071
Thank you for coming into our, our studio.

302
00:14:47,071 --> 00:14:47,954
Good luck to you.

303
00:14:49,036 --> 00:14:50,184
Thank you.

304
00:14:50,184 --> 00:14:51,320
Good to see.

305
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:55,030
Congratulations your parents must be so
proud of you.

306
00:14:55,030 --> 00:14:56,610
It's funny.
Take care.

307
00:14:56,610 --> 00:00:00,000
All right.
