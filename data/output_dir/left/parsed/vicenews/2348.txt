Tell me when you guys are ready.
We announced we were going to be talking to
you.
Yeah.
And we said on the internet send us some
questions.
Right.
Because we want to have a dialogue.
Yeah.
And we'll ask the president.
And the internet blew up.
It was incredible.
I do a lot of environmental pieces and
whenever I do an environmental piece,
out come the box, out come the eggs, you
know on Twitter.
Right.
Because there's all kinds of negative
stuff-.
That they want to caused up.
That's every day for you.
Yeah.
How do you do it?
How do you handle the, the controversy,
the negativity?
Yeah.
Why be pres-, it's, are you a masochist?
You know, l, l, let me tell you, this is a
fun job.
Right.
I, every day I wake up and
I get a bird's eye view on what's going on
everywhere in the world.
Hm.
I can have as much of an impact
on the things that are important to people
as anybody on the planet?
Right.
You know,
if you're applying yourself steadily every
single day to
the job and you're keeping your North Star
which is,
when I leave this office I want things to
be a little bit better.
Then the day to day criticism, the
chatter,
the noise, is something that you end up
blocking out.
And the longer you're in the job the more
you're likely to take the long view.
Let's take something like climate change.
Let's.
We just got back from Antarctica and
Antarctica is melting,
Greenland is melting as fast as they can.
Sea levels are rising, yet many people are
putting their head in the sand.
It's right over the hill, Shane.
Yeah.
Pine Island and
Thwaites are right over the hill, 100
miles from here.
Yeah.
All that ice, it's just a matter of time,
is going to fall down to sea.
If I can change how the country thinks
about this.
Mm-hm.
As, as a serious, immediate threat.
Not some distant vague thing.
Which is crucial.
If I can encourage and gain commitments
from the Chinese
to put forward a serious plan to start
curbing their greenhouse gases.
And that then allows us to leverage the
entire world for
the conference that will be taking this
place this year in, in Paris.
And if I'm able to double fuel efficiency
standards, and if I'm able to
make appliances more efficient, and to
double the production of clean energy.
If I'm able to do all those things now,
when I'm done.
We're still going to have a heck of a
problem, but
we will have made enough progress that,
the next president and
the next generations can start building on
it, you start getting some momentum.
Which is rational, sane
That's a great answer,
however
Yeah.
You have people.
For example Senator Inhofe whose whose
throwing snowballs,
whose saying the greatest hoax perpetrated
on the American
public is that we can do anything about
climate change or that it's even real.
Senator from Oklahoma.
We keep hearing that 2014 has been the
warmest year on record.
I asked the chair, do you know what this
is?
It's a snowball.
And, that's just from outside here.
So it's very, very cold out.
Very unseasonal.
So here Mr. President, catch this.
Throwing a snowball would be funny-
Yeah.
If it weren't for
the fact that he's chairman of the Senate
committee on the environment.
That's disturbing.
So you have a very sane and rational plan,
but
we're not acting in a sane and rational
way.
Yeah.
Well I, and I, I, I'll tell you.
Climate change is an example of the
hardest problems to solve,
the hardest thing to do in politics and in
government is to make
sacrifices now for a long term payoff.
But here's, here's what keeps me
optimistic.
Is, you talk to Malia and Sasha, you know?
Mm-hm.
16 and 13.
Mm-hm.
And the sophistication and awareness that
they have about environmental issues,
compared to my generation or yours.
Yeah.
They're way ahead of the game.
There's always gonna be resistance to
change.
And some of that is gonna be generational.
I guarantee you that the Republican party
will have to change it's approach
to climate change, because voters will
insist upon it.
The challenge on something like climate
change is,
there comes a point of no return.
Mm-hm.
And you do have to make sure that we get
at this thing quick enough and
with enough force, to be able to make a
difference.
Why is the resistance so strong?
Well some of it's economic.
If you poll folks, they're concerned about
climate change.
But they're more concerned about gas
prices.
Right.
You can't fault somebody for being
concerned about paying the bills or
being able to fill up your tank to get to
your job.
In some cases, though, you have elected
officials who are shills for
the oil companies or the fossil fuel
industry.
And there's a lot of money involved.
Typically in Congress the committees of
jurisdiction, like the energy committees,
are populated by folks from places that
pump a lot of oil and pump a lot of gas.
In our research the environment or
global warming is the number one issue
for, for Gen Y.
But another issue is dysfunction.
Yeah.
You know,
it seems that from the outside that.
From the inside too.
That Washington, if you look at global
warming for example.
Yeah.
And you're right, the younger generation,
there is no debate.
Yeah.
Yet they see.
This fighting, this gridlock in-
Yeah.
In Washington.
Or for other things.
Just for example, now sort of chicken
that's being played
with Department of Homeland Security for
example.
Republicans are playing politics with the
critical funding.
For the Department of Homeland Security
and threatening a shut down.
The President's executive amnesty is
lawless and unconstitutional.
These are things that our taxes pay for.
Right.
Yet
it seems to be a game that's being played.
And young people are dissatisfied and
angry, but they don't know what to do.
What would you, what would you tell them?
Well, let me say a couple things.
A lot of times, from the outside, and
sometimes mainstream media reports this
as a food fight, and it's a problem of
both parties just being partisan.
Well, that's just not accurate.
On climate change, 90% of Democrats agree
with me and
90% of Republicans oppose any action on
it.
And a sizable portion of their party deny
it even exists.
There have been times in history where
Democrats have been unreasonable.
Mm.
There have been times where
Republicans have led the way.
But right now, on a lot of the issues that
young people care about,
it's not both sides arguing and creating
gridlock.
You've got one side that is denying the
facts.
Mm.
Who are often motivated, principally,
by opposing whatever it is that I propose.
Now, that's not inevitable to our
democracy.
That's some,
that's a phase that the Republican Party's
going through right now.
And it'll outgrow that phase.
The thing that we do have to worry about
is the fact that
the pace of change globally is so quick.
Mm.
That we may not have the luxury
of 20 years or ten years of not getting a
lot done.
Mm-hm.
If we want to deal with not just climate
change but the potential for a pandemic.
With terrorism, with the challenges around
cyber security.
Some of these things are just moving.
One thing young people could do
immediately-
Yes.
Is vote.
Okay.
And the fact of the matter is, is that in
the last midterm election,
about a third of eligible voters voted.
Mm-hm.
And so, if you've got gridlock and you've
got people who aren't producing,
the fact that a lot of them got rewarded
with reelection and
the people who were in power creating the
gridlock stayed in power,
that's the consequence of everybody
staying home and acting cynical.
And the minute you withdraw in that way
from the process of politics,
well, then you're destined to have the
existing power structures call the shots.
47 Republican senators put their names
today to this open letter to Iran
informing Iran that any nuclear agreement
not voted in by Congress will be viewed
as, quote, nothing more than an executive
agreement between President Obama and
Ayatollah Khamenei.
How does it feel when you're trying to get
a deal done with Iran,
for example, and then you have senators
who are sending separate letters?
Yeah.
Well, it I'm embarrassed for them.
Yeah.
Because it's not how America does
business.
Mm-hm.
I think it's entirely legitimate for
my friends in the Senate who signed that
letter to ask very
hard questions about how can we assure
that Iran's not getting a nuclear weapon.
You know, why would we lift sanctions now
given
how they're causing problems in other part
of the world.
Given the venomous things they've said
about Israel.
You know, how can we even negotiate with
them?
Now, I will have responses to each of
those questions, and
I will say that I've committed to making
sure Iran doesn't have a nuclear weapon.
I'm prepared to take all options to
prevent them from getting a nuclear
weapon, but the absolute best option is a
diplomatic resolution.
And if we do get a deal, it's going to be
because I can verify that they won't have
a weapon and I will have the international
community helping us verify that.
We can have that debate.
For them to address a letter to the
Ayatollah,
the supreme leader of Iran, who they claim
is our mortal enemy, and
their basic argument to them is, don't
deal with our president,
because you can't trust him to follow through
on an agreement.
That's close to unprecedented.
Mm-hm.
We were
looking at the history to see if there was
an example of it.
We couldn't find one.
And by doing so, they were effectively
making common cause with the hardliners in
Iran who also don't want any kind of
diplomatic resolution,
because they are invested in getting a nuclear
weapon.
Mm-hm.
So this is a good example, I think, of
where the state of our politics.
Sure.
That leads Republicans to be more worried
about a Tea Party primary than they are
about what ordinary folks are thinking.
It damages the country, it damages our
standing, it's not productive.
In this day and age where we've got such
big issues, we can't afford it.
We embedded with ISIL last summer for a
month.
One of the biggest questions that I had
was, how did they become so
popular so fast?
How did they get so many foreign fighters
from America, from the UK-.
Mm-hm.
You know, from Scandinavia,
from all over the world, go there,
outstrip al-Qaeda almost overnight?
Yeah.
And so, A, how did they become so popular
out of nowhere?
And then, B, how do we stop them?
Two things.
One is ISIL is a direct outgrowth of
Al-Qaeda in Iraq.
Mm-hm.
That grew out of our invasion.
Which is an example of unintended
consequences,
which is why we should generally aim
before we shoot.
We've got a 60 country coalition.
We will slowly push back ISIL out of Iraq.
I'm confident that will happen.
But what I'm worried about, and
what we have to stay worried about, is,
even if ISIL is defeated,
the underlying problem of disaffected
Sunnis around the world,
but particularly in some of these areas,
including Libya, including Yemen.
Where a young man who's growing up, has no
education and
has no prospects for the future, is
looking around, and
the one way that he can get validation,
power, respect as if he's a fighter.
And this looks like the toughest gang
around, so let me affiliate with them.
Mm-hm.
And now you're giving me a, a religious
rationale for doing this.
That's a problem we're gonna have, have
generally and
we can't keep on thinking about
counter-terrorism and
security as entirely separate from
diplomacy, development, education.
All these things that are considered soft,
but
in fact, are vital to our national
security.
And we do not fund those.
If you asked the average person, how much
do we spend on foreign aid?
They'll say, 25% of the federal budget.
Right.
Well it's a little over 1%.
Mm-hm.
We should be thinking about making
investments there
that ultimately save us from having to
send our young men and women
to fight or having folks come here and,
and doing great harm.
This is the last question.
All right.
Our number one question
from everyone on the Internet.
Yeah.
Was, and this might seem flippant, but
with the War on Drugs.
Yeah.
With too many people in prisons,
like we said, it's hurting education.
Right.
States are legalizing marijuana.
Right.
It seems like an inevitability.
I declare this war over.
We're ending a failed policy of
prohibition.
For young people, I'm sorry, but if you
legalize marijuana,
it would be the biggest part of your
legacy.
So what are your thoughts on that?
Well first of all, it shouldn't be young
people's biggest priority.
Right.
The.
It was our, it was our, it was our most
popular.
I, I, no I understand 'cause, 'cause sometimes
on the, the White House website and
petitions you know we get the same.
So let's put it in perspective, young
people I understand this is
important to you but, you know, you should
be thinking about climate change.
Right.
The economy, jobs, war and peace.
Maybe way at the bottom you should be
thinking about marijuana.
I, I'd separate out the issue of
decriminalization
of marijuana from encouraging its use.
I think there is no doubt that our
criminal justice system generally is so
heavily skewed towards cracking down on
non-violent drug offenders.
Mm-hm.
That, it has not just had a,
a terrible effect on, many communities,
particularly communities of color.
Rendering a lot of folks unemployable,
because they got felony records.
Disproportionate prison sentences.
It costs a huge amount of money to states,
and
a lot of states are staring to figure that
out.
But, what I'm encouraged by is,
you're starting to see, not just liberal
Democrats, but also some con-,
very conservative Republicans recognize
this doesn't make sense.
Including sort of the Libertarian wing of
the Republican party.
And they see the money in it.
And they see the money and, and how costly
it is to incarcerate.
So, we may actually be able to make some
progress on the decriminalization side.
At a certain point if enough states, end
up,
decriminalizing, then Congress may then,
you know, reschedule marijuana.
Mm-hm.
And I always say to folks, you know,
legalization or
decriminalization is not a panacea.
Do you feel the same way about meth?
Mm-hm.
Do we feel the same way about coke?
How about crack?
How about heroin?
And, and, and, there is a legitimate, I
think, concern about the overall effects
this has on society and, and particularly
vulnerable parts of our society.
Substance abuse, generally legal and
illegal substances, is a problem.
Locking somebody up for 20 years is
probably not the best strategy.
And that's something that we have to re,
rethink as society as a whole.
Mr. President, I'd like to thank you for
your time today and
I'd like to thank you for coming here and
talking about, young issues or issues for
young people as well as being with the
students.
I had a great time.
Thank you.
All right, we got it.
Thanks, Mr. President.
Appreciate it, man.
Do you guys want to take a picture with
the crew before I get out of here?
Come on, guys.
