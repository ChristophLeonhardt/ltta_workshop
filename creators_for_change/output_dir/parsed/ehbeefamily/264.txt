first you'll need some water you'll need
scissors or sky skeezers whatever you

dish soap any soap around the house a
sock I would recommend like these fuzzy
kind of socks like kind of this material
you would need a permanent marker a
rubber band a plate for your water and
your soap and you will need an empty
water bottle father would you like to do

I'd say permanent marker to draw a line
around where you want to cut your water

around there ask your parents before you
do anything cut cut cut cut

your thumb on top of the water bottles
but wait wait just there you have to put
on your rubber band so that it doesn't
fall off now you have your bubble
dispenser grab your soap I'm using dish
soap and pour some in to this
okay now just mix it around don't worry
people I've washed my hands okay and you
see how it's a little bit watery that is
okay just a little bit more so is there
a formula there is not a formula you can
add as much of anything as you want any

consistency and now after we've done
