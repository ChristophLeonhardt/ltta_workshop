As soon as China announced
it would remove term limits
on the presidency, its censors
and propaganda machine
kicked into gear.
The surprise move would
clear the way for Xi Jinping
to stay in power indefinitely.
It’s a break from
China’s decades-old rules
to prevent power from being too
centralized around one person.
“In China, the most important
political announcements
are made through the
state-owned news organizations.
This explosive news was announced
by Xinhua news agency
on Sunday in the afternoon.”
So how did officials
try to spin the news?
On Weibo, China’s version
of Twitter, China.com
published this video
focusing on the central role
of the president.
“In the face of the complicated
domestic and international
situation, this will
further promote
the sustainable development
of various great causes.”
China Central Television
ran a similar editorial,
stating that “the people
love their dear leader.”
Global Times, a Chinese daily,
published an editorial
recommending that people
“firmly support the
constitution amendment suggestion,
which is both the rational choice
and our belief.”
But the same day, it
published an editorial
that depicted the news
in a softer light,
saying, “The change doesn’t mean
that the Chinese president will
have a lifelong tenure.”
The People’s Liberation Army Daily
is the voice of the military.
It published a write-up
saying that soldiers
and armed policemen all
support the decision.
"President Xi Jinping
has consolidated
his control of the army,
and all of the soldiers
are supporting him 100 percent."
State-run media tried to control
the narrative in Hong Kong, too.
“That video was made
by the Ta Kung Pao.
It’s a pro-Beijing
Hong Kong newspaper.
And I think the most
important part of the video
is trying to let people know
that the Chinese constitution
actually had been
changed four times
in the past several decades.
So it’s not a big deal.
So people don’t
need to freak out.”
But not everyone
was on board.
Chinese citizens took
to social media networks
to voice their
disagreements.
One user said he couldn’t use
the word “disagree” on Weibo,
because it was
apparently a violation
of the social platform‘s terms.
But perhaps not surprisingly,
those comments
were swiftly removed
from the web.
