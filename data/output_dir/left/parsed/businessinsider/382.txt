when they would go up to the mountains
and they would come back they would tell
us you know that it's a care of himself
he didn't do drugs himself he didn't
drink he wanted us to keep his mind and
his body healthy he would take vitamins
he was a very violent man so everybody
was intimidated by him he didn't have to
yell he would just study people and it's
like he was looking right through them
you know he was just studying everything
everywhere they were saying because in
this business you know nobody trusts
anybody but he had a soft side for my
husband and my brother-in-law
and I'm sure that they crushed him when
they decided to cooperate and this is
why he was extradited to the United
States
