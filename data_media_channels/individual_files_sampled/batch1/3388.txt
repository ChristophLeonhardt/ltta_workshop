it wasn't always one nation under WWE for decades the pro wrestling landscape operated under a system defined by territories the word territory was used to describe an individual pro wrestling promotion each territory was defined by informal boundaries and in most cases run by a single promoter he had like approximately thirty or forty wrestling territories at one time in North America and the reason was so successful is because the guys that had the that owned the territories and ran the territories had the only game in town of that genre they had no competition within the genre pro wrestling and when there's only three TV stations in most markets they had the world by the short hairs right here the $100,000 challenge but each territory had its own stable of talent stars who could fill arenas and draw viewers on local TV broadcasts many of wrestling's biggest stars emerge from the territories like Hulk Hogan of the AWA in Minneapolis Bret Hart from Stampede Wrestling in Calgary and Ric Flair and mid-atlantic Championship Wrestling in Charlotte and up in the Northeast there was the worldwide Wrestling Federation or WWWF this territory was run by Vincent J McMahon father of Vincent Kennedy McMahon in 1982 the younger Vince McMahon bought the company by then renamed the WWF from his father McMahon's goal to make the WWF the premier Pro Wrestling promotion in the United States and later the world here's what he told Sports Illustrated in 1991 in the old days that were wrestling fiefdom zall over the country each with its own little Lord in charge there were maybe 30 of these tiny kingdoms in the US and if I hadn't bought out my dad there would still be 30 of them fragmented and struggling I of course had no allegiance to those little Lords so without allegiance to the other territories McMahon began his quest for domination and he quickly realized the key to his eventual victory cable in 1983 McMahon made a deal with the USA Network which put the WWF on the Nash whilst age no one had any idea of Abel he was coming out they see that show in LA they see that show in st. Louis he got show in Minneapolis Wow what is that kid Vince McMahon doing he's ruining us and I'm gonna tell you something they hated him but the talent loved him popular wrestlers began to leave their territories for the WWF with promises of increased exposure and bigger paydays well the territories were out of business they start developing new stars they refuse to change their ways of how they promoted and they they self-destructed and of course being man comes along what a big vision and he also facilitates their becoming irrelevant by creating competition in the marketplace and the reason a lot of wrestling promoters think McMahon is the enemy is because they didn't like our position but McMahon would soon have some competition of his own in the form of media mogul Ted Turner in 1988 Turner acquired Jim Crockett Promotions which ever saw valuable promotions in the central states south east and mid-atlantic territories this acquisition resulted in Turner's national promotion World Championship Wrestling or WCW by the 1990s WWF and WCW were the only two national promotions was sustained momentum the two companies were embroiled in a bitter battle during that decade and a period known as the Monday Night Wars WWF which eventually became known as WWE prevailed and Vince McMahon bought WCW in 2001 for a mere 4.2 million dollars in today WWE is a billion dollar company with millions of fans around the world some smaller promotions exist but there's no denying that WWE is the biggest show in the world and Vince McMahon remains the king of the pro wrestling universe you
