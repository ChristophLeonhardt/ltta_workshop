1
00:00:01,652 --> 00:00:03,487
EVERYONE SHOULD REJECT.

00:00:03,487 --> 00:00:03,888
TUCKER.

00:00:03,888 --> 00:00:04,622

00:00:04,622 --> 00:00:06,257
THANKS A LOT FOR THAT.

00:00:06,257 --> 00:00:07,324
TODAY'S REPORT IS DAMNING.

6
00:00:07,324 --> 00:00:08,359
COULD IT HAVE BEEN WORSE

7
00:00:08,359 --> 00:00:09,960
WITH THE ORIGINAL FINDING

8
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:11,262

REPUBLICAN WHO REPRESENTS

00:00:13,297 --> 00:00:13,631
OHIO.

13
00:00:13,631 --> 00:00:14,799
HE HAS INTRODUCED A

14
00:00:14,799 --> 00:00:15,533
RESOLUTION CALLING FOR THE

15
00:00:15,533 --> 00:00:17,368

00:00:21,672 --> 00:00:22,606
CONGRESSMAN, THANKS A LOT

22
00:00:23,073 --> 00:00:24,074
>> YOU BET.

23
00:00:24,074 --> 00:00:25,676
GOOD TO SEE YOU, TUCKER.

24
00:00:25,676 --> 00:00:26,744
>> Tucker: YOU SUSPECT THIS

25
00:00:26,744 --> 00:00:27,945
IS NOT ALL THERE IS.

26
00:00:27,945 --> 00:00:29,280
>> WE HAVE BEEN ASKING FOR

27
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:29,980
ALL KINDS OF DOCUMENTS.

28
00:00:29,980 --> 00:00:31,182
>> WE HAVE CAUGHT THEM

29
00:00:31,182 --> 00:00:31,849
HIDING DOCUMENTS.

30
00:00:31,849 --> 00:00:33,083
HOW ABOUT THE FACT, TUCKER,

31
00:00:33,083 --> 00:00:34,718
WE HAVE SEEN ALL THESE TEXT

32
00:00:34,718 --> 00:00:35,386
MESSAGES, THOUSANDS.

33
00:00:35,386 --> 00:00:37,655
THE ATTORNEY GENERAL SAID, I

34
00:00:37,655 --> 00:00:38,422
FORGET, 50,000 TEXT MESSAGES

35
00:00:38,422 --> 00:00:39,490
BETWEEN STRZOK AND PAGE.

36
00:00:39,490 --> 00:00:40,958
THE ONE MOST TELLING WAS THE

37
00:00:40,958 --> 00:00:43,794
ONE THAT SAYS WE'LL STOP

38
00:00:43,794 --> 00:00:44,094
TRUMP.

39
00:00:44,094 --> 00:00:45,796
WE DON'T SEE THAT ONE UNTIL

40
00:00:45,796 --> 00:00:46,163
TODAY?

41
00:00:46,163 --> 00:00:47,498
SO, YEAH, THEY HAVEN'T

42
00:00:47,498 --> 00:00:48,933
COMPLIED WITH SUBPOENAS FROM

43
00:00:48,933 --> 00:00:50,134
CHAIRMAN GOODLATTE,

44
00:00:50,134 --> 00:00:51,268
SUBPOENAS FROM CHAIRMAN

45
00:00:51,268 --> 00:00:51,602

46
00:00:51,602 --> 00:00:53,370
WE HAVE CAUGHT THEM TRYING

47
00:00:53,370 --> 00:00:54,605
TO HIDE INFORMATION FROM US.

48
00:00:54,605 --> 00:00:56,273
THEY KEPT THIS TEXT MESSAGE

49
00:00:56,273 --> 00:00:56,774
UNTIL TODAY.

50
00:00:56,774 --> 00:00:58,275
OF COURSE WE WANT THE

51
00:00:58,275 --> 00:00:59,477
INFORMATION SO WE CAN DO OUR

52
00:00:59,477 --> 00:00:59,743
JOB.

53
00:00:59,743 --> 00:01:00,978
LAST THING I WOULD SAY IS

54
00:01:00,978 --> 00:01:02,079
JUST REMEMBER IT WAS A

55
00:01:02,079 --> 00:01:03,147
COUPLE DAYS AGO THAT WE

56
00:01:03,147 --> 00:01:04,882
LEARNED THAT ROD ROSENSTEIN,

57
00:01:04,882 --> 00:01:06,383
WHO IN ESSENCE RUNS THE

58
00:01:06,383 --> 00:01:07,218
DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE RIGHT

59
00:01:07,218 --> 00:01:08,486
NOW WAS THREATENING STAFF

60
00:01:08,486 --> 00:01:09,386
MEMBERS ON THE INTELLIGENCE

61
00:01:09,386 --> 00:01:09,753
COMMITTEE.

62
00:01:09,753 --> 00:01:10,988
SO WHEN YOU PUT ALL THIS

63
00:01:10,988 --> 00:01:12,056
TOGETHER, OF COURSE WE NEED

64
00:01:12,056 --> 00:01:13,224
A RESOLUTION SAYING GIVE US

65
00:01:13,224 --> 00:01:14,525

OUR JOB AND GET ANSWERS FOR

67
00:01:15,659 --> 00:01:18,262
THE AMERICAN PEOPLE.

68
00:01:18,262 --> 00:01:18,929
>> Tucker: SO UNIDENTIFIED

69
00:01:18,929 --> 00:01:20,498
FBI LAWYER NUMBER TWO IN

70
00:01:20,498 --> 00:01:22,399
THIS DOCUMENT IS QUOTED

71
00:01:22,399 --> 00:01:23,534
LAMENTING THE FACT HE DIDN'T

00:01:23,534 --> 00:01:26,437
TRY HARDER TO GETS HILLARY

73
00:01:26,437 --> 00:01:28,038

76
00:01:30,808 --> 00:01:32,209
AND HE GOES TO WORK FOR

77
00:01:32,209 --> 00:01:32,543
MUELLER.

78
00:01:32,543 --> 00:01:33,811
WHY DON'T I AS A CITIZEN

79
00:01:33,811 --> 00:01:35,412
HAVE A TRITE KNOW WHO THAT

80
00:01:35,412 --> 00:01:36,714
IS AND WHAT IS HE DOING NOW.

81
00:01:36,714 --> 00:01:37,781
>> I AGREE WITH YOU.

82
00:01:37,781 --> 00:01:39,183
IN FACT WE TWEETED HOW THE

83
00:01:39,183 --> 00:01:40,050
WHO IS LAWYER NUMBER TWO.

84
00:01:40,050 --> 00:01:40,985
WE WANT TO KNOW.

85
00:01:40,985 --> 00:01:42,119

INVESTIGATION.

89
00:01:45,723 --> 00:01:47,925
HE WAS THE LEAD LAWYER

90
00:01:47,925 --> 00:01:49,159
PRIMARY LAWYER ON THE TRUMP

91
00:01:49,159 --> 00:01:50,094
RUSSIA INVESTIGATION.

92
00:01:50,094 --> 00:01:51,495
ALL THREE OF THOSE

93
00:01:51,495 --> 00:01:52,129
INDIVIDUALS WENT ON THE

94
00:01:52,129 --> 00:01:53,163
MUELLER TEAM.

95
00:01:53,163 --> 00:01:54,365
SUBSEQUENTLY KICKED OFF THE

96
00:01:54,365 --> 00:01:55,799
MUELLER TEAM BECAUSE OF

97
00:01:55,799 --> 00:01:56,700
ANIMUS THEY HAD AGAINST

98
00:01:56,700 --> 00:01:57,201
PRESIDENT TRUMP.

99
00:01:57,201 --> 00:01:57,868
IT'S INTERESTING.

100
00:01:57,868 --> 00:01:58,802
THE THREE PEOPLE THAT COME

101
00:01:58,802 --> 00:01:59,870

102
00:01:59,870 --> 00:02:01,038
MUELLER'S TEAM ALL WERE ON

103
00:02:01,038 --> 00:02:01,772

104
00:02:01,772 --> 00:02:02,873
ALL WERE ON THE RUSSIAN

105
00:02:02,873 --> 00:02:03,307

THAT'S INTERESTING TO ME.

109
00:02:06,176 --> 00:02:07,378
SO, YEAH, WE NEED TO FIND

110
00:02:07,378 --> 00:02:08,545
OUT WHO THIS INDIVIDUAL IS

111
00:02:08,545 --> 00:02:09,613
AND BRING HIM IN.

112
00:02:09,613 --> 00:02:11,348

115
00:02:12,683 --> 00:02:13,817
REMEMBER WHEN THIS HAPPENED.

116
00:02:13,817 --> 00:02:15,953
THIS IS A TEXT MESSAGE FROM

117
00:02:15,953 --> 00:02:16,353
AUGUST 8TH.

118
00:02:16,353 --> 00:02:19,156
SO PETER STRZOK OPENS THE

119
00:02:19,156 --> 00:02:19,790

SIX DAYS LATER WE HAVE THE

123
00:02:23,761 --> 00:02:24,194

124
00:02:24,194 --> 00:02:25,729
WE HAVE AN INSURANCE POLICY

125
00:02:25,729 --> 00:02:27,298
TO MAKE SURE -- IF THAT

126
00:02:27,298 --> 00:02:28,532
DOESN'T SHOW WHERE THESE

127
00:02:28,532 --> 00:02:29,466
