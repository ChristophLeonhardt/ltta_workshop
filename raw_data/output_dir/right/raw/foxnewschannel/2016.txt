00:01:03,119 --> 00:01:05,254
OF THE DEAL NEGOTIATING STYLE OF

TRUMP AND THEN TRUMP, WHEN HE

34
00:01:06,355 --> 00:01:08,291
CAME INTO OFFICE, I THINK

35
00:01:08,291 --> 00:01:10,393
EVERYBODY REALIZED THERE WAS AN

36
00:01:10,393 --> 00:01:13,696
ASYMMETRY WITH CHINA WHETHER IT

37
00:01:13,696 --> 00:01:14,597
WAS INFRINGEMENT OR COPYRIGHT OR

38
00:01:14,597 --> 00:01:15,965
TECHNOLOGY APPROPRIATION FROM

39
00:01:15,965 --> 00:01:18,701
AMERICAN COMPANIES AND DUMPING

00:01:18,701 --> 00:01:20,736
AND CYBER WARFARE, ET CETERA,

41
00:01:20,736 --> 00:01:22,171
ET CETERA, AND THAT THEORY THAT

42
00:01:22,171 --> 00:01:25,474
IF WE WORK TO GIVE THESE

43
00:01:25,474 --> 00:01:26,509
CONCESSIONS TO CHINA IN THE

44
00:01:26,509 --> 00:01:28,210

INTO THE FAMILY OF NATIONS AND

46
00:01:29,512 --> 00:01:30,279
THEIR AFFLUENCE AND THEIR

47
00:01:30,279 --> 00:01:32,682
ECONOMIC BOOM WOULD MAKE THEM

48
00:01:32,682 --> 00:01:33,916
DEMOCRATIZED AND THEY WOULD BE

49
00:01:33,916 --> 00:01:35,318
SORT OF A HELPFUL PLAYER IN THE

50
00:01:35,318 --> 00:01:36,385

REVEALED TO BE FLAWED.

00:01:38,387 --> 00:01:40,623

ABOUT THESE ASYMMETRICAL -- THE

54
00:01:43,192 --> 00:01:44,460

55
00:01:44,460 --> 00:01:47,463
NATO CONTRIBUTIONS THAT WE

56
00:01:47,463 --> 00:01:48,864
THOUGHT WHAT WAS NORMAL REALLY

57
00:01:48,864 --> 00:01:49,198
WASN'T.

58
00:01:49,198 --> 00:01:49,899
IT WAS PREDICATED ON THE IDEA

59
00:01:49,899 --> 00:01:52,034
THAT WE WERE SO STRONG AND

60
00:01:52,034 --> 00:01:53,302
POWERFUL WE COULD ALWAYS MAKE

00:01:55,738 --> 00:01:57,673
PEOPLE IN BETWEEN THE COAST SAID

63
00:01:57,673 --> 00:01:59,075
WE DON'T WANT TO MAKE

64
00:01:59,075 --> 00:02:00,509
CONCESSIONS BECAUSE WE ARE NOT

65
00:02:00,509 --> 00:02:02,812
AS POWERFUL, AT LEAST WE AREN'T.

66
00:02:02,812 --> 00:02:04,547
AND AS AFFLUENT AS YOU PEOPLE

00:02:04,547 --> 00:02:06,849
WHO CREATE THESE DEALS.

68
00:02:06,849 --> 00:02:09,651

69
00:02:09,651 --> 00:02:10,686

SEE HOW TRUMP HAS SHIFTED THE

74

DEBATE ON CHINA.

75
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:19,362
I WAS GOING BACK JUST GOOGLING

76
00:02:19,362 --> 00:02:22,865
TRUMP WAS RIGHT ON CHINA.

77
00:02:22,865 --> 00:02:23,466
FINANCIAL TIMES -- I'M

78
00:02:23,466 --> 00:02:26,936
PARAPHRASING, MARCO RUBIO'S WAY

79
00:02:26,936 --> 00:02:29,038
OVER, PROBABLY TO THE RIGHT OF

80
00:02:29,038 --> 00:02:30,706
TRUMP ON CHINA AND NOW IT IS

81
00:02:30,706 --> 00:02:31,640
PRETTY MUCH COMMONLY THOUGHT

82
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:32,842
CHINA IS CHEATING ON A WHOLE

83
00:02:32,842 --> 00:02:34,443
HOST OF ISSUES, THEY ARE

84
00:02:34,443 --> 00:02:35,711
STEALING A LOT OF OUR

85
00:02:35,711 --> 00:02:36,612
INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY AND THEY

86
00:02:36,612 --> 00:02:38,647
ARE POISED TO ECLIPSE THE

87
00:02:38,647 --> 00:02:42,785
UNITED STATES IN A LOT OF

88
00:02:42,785 --> 00:02:43,452
DIFFERENT WAYS UNLESS WE

89
00:02:43,452 --> 00:02:44,453
RECALIBRATE AT LEAST THE PLAYING

90
00:02:44,453 --> 00:02:45,054
FIELD.

91
00:02:45,054 --> 00:02:46,455
WHERE DO THINGS STAND NOW, AND

92
00:02:46,455 --> 00:02:47,857
THEN WE WILL MOVE TO THE IRAN

93
00:02:47,857 --> 00:02:49,458
DEAL VERY QUICK.

94
00:02:49,458 --> 00:02:50,159
>> THEY ARE MARKUP POWERFUL.

95
00:02:50,159 --> 00:02:52,495
THEY ARE A LARGER ECONOMY.

96
00:02:52,495 --> 00:02:53,796
THEIR ABILITY TO PROMOTE THEIR

97
00:02:53,796 --> 00:02:54,764
OWN COMPANIES BECAUSE THEY ARE

98
00:02:54,764 --> 00:02:56,599
NOT BECOMING A FREE MARKET

99
00:02:56,599 --> 00:02:58,300
ECONOMY IS MAKING IT MUCH HARDER

100
00:02:58,300 --> 00:02:59,468
FOR THE AMERICANS TO HAVE

101
00:02:59,468 --> 00:03:00,069
ACCESS.

102
00:03:00,069 --> 00:03:01,270
TRUMP HAS BEEN HITTING THEM

103
00:03:01,270 --> 00:03:02,071
PARTICULARLY HARD ON THE

104
00:03:02,071 --> 00:03:03,706
TECHNOLOGY SIDE AND THAT'S WHERE

105
00:03:03,706 --> 00:03:05,107
FRANKLY WE DON'T HAVE A LOT OF

106
00:03:05,107 --> 00:03:05,574
INTERDEPENDENCE.

107
00:03:05,574 --> 00:03:06,308
THAT'S WHERE I THINK THE

108
00:03:06,308 --> 00:03:07,510
RELATIONSHIP IS GOING TO BE MORE

109
00:03:07,510 --> 00:03:07,910
CHALLENGING.

110
00:03:07,910 --> 00:03:11,113
ON TRADE, THEY WANT TO EXPORT TO

111
00:03:11,113 --> 00:03:12,481
US, WE WANT TO IMPORT FROM THEM

112
00:03:12,481 --> 00:03:14,216
AND A LOT OF OUR COMPANIES THAT

113
00:03:14,216 --> 00:03:16,685
ARE ACTUALLY MANUFACTURING AND

114
00:03:16,685 --> 00:03:17,353
EXPORTING, I DON'T THINK THE

115
00:03:17,353 --> 00:03:18,587
HEADLINE IS GOING TO LEAD TO A

116
00:03:18,587 --> 00:03:18,988
TRADE WAR.

117
00:03:18,988 --> 00:03:20,089
I THINK BOTH SIDES WILL ACTUALLY

118
00:03:20,089 --> 00:03:22,691
END UP NEGOTIATING.

119
00:03:22,691 --> 00:03:24,060
>> Laura: LET'S GO TO YOU ON

120
00:03:24,060 --> 00:03:25,528
THE ISSUE OF THE IRAN DEAL.

121
00:03:25,528 --> 00:03:27,496
THE BIG ISSUE TOMORROW.

122
00:03:27,496 --> 00:03:28,164
HERE'S THE HEADLINE FROM THE

123
00:03:28,164 --> 00:03:30,266
TELEGRAPH TONIGHT.

124
00:03:30,266 --> 00:03:32,334
IF TRUMP SCRAPS THE IRAN NUCLEAR

125
00:03:32,334 --> 00:03:32,935
AGREEMENT, WHY SHOULD

126
00:03:32,935 --> 00:03:33,636
NORTH KOREA MAKE ITS OWN DEAL

127
00:03:33,636 --> 00:03:35,237
WITH AMERICA?

128
00:03:35,237 --> 00:03:36,639
THAT'S THE CONVENTIONAL WISDOM,

129
00:03:36,639 --> 00:03:38,140
IT'S GOING TO BE BAD FOR

130
00:03:38,140 --> 00:03:38,808
NORTH KOREA, I THINK YOU CAN

131
00:03:38,808 --> 00:03:41,477
MAKE THE OTHER ARGUMENT.

132
00:03:41,477 --> 00:03:42,578
YOU CAN SAY ACTUALLY SHOWS THAT

133
00:03:42,578 --> 00:03:44,880
TRUMP WILL NOT SIGN ON TO A DEAL

134
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:46,916
THAT HE VIEWS IS NOT IN OUR

135
00:03:46,916 --> 00:03:47,683
INTEREST OR THE INTEREST OF OUR

136
00:03:47,683 --> 00:03:48,551
MIDDLE EASTERN ALLIES.

137
00:03:48,551 --> 00:03:52,221
YOUR REACTION TO THIS POTENTIAL

138
00:03:52,221 --> 00:03:54,457
MOVE?

139
00:03:54,457 --> 00:03:56,692
>> I AGREE WITH THE LATTER

140
00:03:56,692 --> 00:03:57,426
INTERPRETATION, THAT NORTH KOREA

141
00:03:57,426 --> 00:03:58,160
WILL GET A MESSAGE THAT IF IT'S

142
00:03:58,160 --> 00:04:00,196
NOT SYMMETRICAL IT'S NOT GOING

143
00:04:00,196 --> 00:04:01,630
TO STAND THE TEST OF TIME, BUT

144
00:04:01,630 --> 00:04:02,364
MORE IMPORTANTLY, WE SHOULDN'T

145
00:04:02,364 --> 00:04:05,234
EVEN BE HERE BECAUSE THAT SHOULD

146
00:04:05,234 --> 00:04:06,368
HAVE BEEN A TREATY AND OBAMA DID

147
00:04:06,368 --> 00:04:07,236
NOT HAVE THE VOTES IN THE

148
00:04:07,236 --> 00:04:11,207
CONGRESS, THE SENATE AND SO HE

149
00:04:11,207 --> 00:04:12,108
WENT AROUND THEM AND THE SAD

150
00:04:12,108 --> 00:04:13,342
THING ABOUT IT -- THEY WERE

151
00:04:13,342 --> 00:04:18,447
BLEEDING ABOUT 125, ABOUT

152
00:04:18,447 --> 00:04:19,281
150 BILLION A YEAR.

153
00:04:19,281 --> 00:04:21,350
I GIVE THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION

154
00:04:21,350 --> 00:04:22,518
CREDIT FOR FINALLY RATCHETING UP

155
00:04:22,518 --> 00:04:22,952
THE SANCTIONS.

156
00:04:22,952 --> 00:04:26,455
OVER THE LIKES OF THE FIRST TEN

157
00:04:26,455 --> 00:04:27,289
AND THE ADDITIONAL FIVE YEARS

158
00:04:27,289 --> 00:04:28,023
THEY WILL HAVE ABOUT A HALF A

159
00:04:28,023 --> 00:04:30,392
TRILLION TO 700 BILLION THAT

160
00:04:30,392 --> 00:04:31,160
THEY OTHERWISE WOULDN'T HAVE HAD

161
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:32,895
AND WE CAN SEE WHERE THAT IS

162
00:04:32,895 --> 00:04:35,531
GOING.

163
00:04:35,664 --> 00:04:36,765
IT'S GOING TO SHOOT MISSILES

164
00:04:36,765 --> 00:04:37,800
INTO SAUDI ARABIA.

165
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:40,870
IT'S GOING FOR HAS BLAH IT

166
00:04:40,870 --> 00:04:42,004
WASN'T MORE THAN SIX MONTHS

167
00:04:42,004 --> 00:04:44,273
AFTER THIS TREATY AND THEY WERE

168
00:04:44,273 --> 00:04:47,176
SHOOTING A MISSILE AT THE

169
00:04:47,176 --> 00:04:47,776
USS TRUMAN.

170
00:04:47,776 --> 00:04:51,180
THEY HIJACKED -- IT DIDN'T HAVE

171
00:04:51,180 --> 00:04:52,715
THE ADDED EFFECT OF AFFECTING

172
00:04:52,715 --> 00:04:54,016
THEIR MISSILE PROGRAM OR THEIR

173
00:04:54,016 --> 00:04:55,518
BEHAVIOR AND I DON'T THINK THEY

174
00:04:55,518 --> 00:04:56,385
WERE GOING TO BE ABLE TO PRODUCE

175
00:04:56,385 --> 00:04:58,954
ANY NUCLEAR WEAPONS IN THAT

176
00:04:58,954 --> 00:04:59,455
TENURE.

177
00:04:59,455 --> 00:05:00,856
NOT BECAUSE THEY HAD CIVIL

178
00:05:00,856 --> 00:05:02,858
UNREST AND THEIR ECONOMY WAS

179
00:05:02,858 --> 00:05:03,192
RUINED.

180
00:05:03,192 --> 00:05:05,327
NOW THEY'VE GOT A GREEN LIGHT IN

181
00:05:05,327 --> 00:05:06,729
TEN YEARS AND I THINK THEY WILL

182
00:05:06,729 --> 00:05:08,097
TAKE ADVANTAGE OF IT.

183
00:05:08,097 --> 00:05:09,565
>> Laura: WHERE DOES THIS

184
00:05:09,565 --> 00:05:10,065
STAND TONIGHT?

185
00:05:10,065 --> 00:05:11,700
>> TWO THINGS I WOULD SAY.

186
00:05:11,700 --> 00:05:14,136
THE FIRST IS THAT WE KNOW ALL OF

187
00:05:14,136 --> 00:05:16,438
AMERICA'S ALLIES IN EUROPE

188
00:05:16,438 --> 00:05:16,972
STRONGLY OPPOSE THE

189
00:05:16,972 --> 00:05:18,674
UNITED STATES LEADING BY

190
00:05:18,674 --> 00:05:19,041
OURSELVES.

191
00:05:19,041 --> 00:05:21,076
THE FRENCH AND THE GERMAN

192
00:05:21,076 --> 00:05:21,810
LEADERS WERE HERE ASKING TRUMP

193
00:05:21,810 --> 00:05:22,711
TO GIVE THEM SOME TIME SO THAT

194
00:05:22,711 --> 00:05:25,281
THEY COULD TRY TO COME UP WITH

195
00:05:25,281 --> 00:05:26,782
WHAT WOULD BE A TOUGHER DEAL

196
00:05:26,782 --> 00:05:27,483
AGAINST THE IRANIANS.

197
00:05:27,483 --> 00:05:28,184
IF I WAS ADVISING TRUMP RIGHT

198
00:05:28,184 --> 00:05:32,054
NOW I WOULD SAY MAY 12TH IS YOUR

199
00:05:32,054 --> 00:05:34,056
DEADLINE, GIVE THEM TWO MORE

200
00:05:34,056 --> 00:05:35,257
MONTHS AND IF IT TURNS OUT THEY

201
00:05:35,257 --> 00:05:36,492
DON'T COME UP WITH ANYTHING

202
00:05:36,492 --> 00:05:38,027
ELSE, YOU SAY IT'S THEIR FAULT.

203
00:05:38,027 --> 00:05:39,862
YOU LISTEN TO THE ALICE, YOU

204
00:05:39,862 --> 00:05:40,896
HAVE THE ABILITY TO BLAME THEM.

205
00:05:40,896 --> 00:05:41,830
IF THEY GIVE YOU SOMETHING

206
00:05:41,830 --> 00:05:43,866
BETTER THAN YOU ARE A HERO AND

207
00:05:43,866 --> 00:05:45,467
YOU'VE ALSO GOT BETTER

208
00:05:45,467 --> 00:05:46,468
CREDIBILITY ON IRAN.

209
00:05:46,468 --> 00:05:47,269
ONE OTHER POINT, TRUMP NEVER

210
00:05:47,269 --> 00:05:49,538
BRINGS UP THE FACT THAT THE ONE

211
00:05:49,538 --> 00:05:50,306
THING AMERICANS CARE ABOUT IS

212
00:05:50,306 --> 00:05:51,774
NOT THE MIDDLE EAST BUT THEY

213
00:05:51,774 --> 00:05:53,275
WANT OIL PRICES DOWN.

214
00:05:53,275 --> 00:00:00,000
THIS DEAL IS ACTUALLY KEEPING
