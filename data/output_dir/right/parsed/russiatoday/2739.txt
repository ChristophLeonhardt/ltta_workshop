now there was widespread panic on the
u.s. pacific islands of Hawaii on
Saturday over an official alert telling
people to run for cover because of a
ballistic missile threat although it did
turn out to be a false alarm people were
sent text messages and TV broadcasts
were interrupted to raise the alarm
within minutes though officials scramble
to reassure people that in fact there
was no threat a local congresswoman did
tweet there is no incoming missile the
message was sent out inadvertently but
locals were already rushing for for
cover and safety was some trying to take
shelter in storm drains the Governor of
Hawaii apologized for the incident and
blamed it on an employee pushing a
button by mistake
