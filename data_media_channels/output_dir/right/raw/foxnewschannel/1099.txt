1
00:00:00,153 --> 00:00:01,221
PROTECTIONS ON OPEN VENUES

2
00:00:01,221 --> 00:00:02,755
LIKE CONCERTS AND SPORTING

3
00:00:02,755 --> 00:00:03,089
EVENTS.

4
00:00:03,089 --> 00:00:04,090
THEY ARE KEEPING AN EYE NOW

5
00:00:04,090 --> 00:00:08,728
ON THE SKY.

6
00:00:08,728 --> 00:00:10,029
BRIAN?

7
00:00:10,029 --> 00:00:11,464
INTERESTING WEEK OF PRIMARY

8
00:00:11,464 --> 00:00:13,533
RESULTS MAINLY IN

9
00:00:13,533 --> 00:00:13,933
CALIFORNIA.

10
00:00:13,933 --> 00:00:15,134
14 DISTRICTS WITH HOUSE

11
00:00:15,134 --> 00:00:15,435
SEATS.

12
00:00:15,435 --> 00:00:16,736
THEY THOUGHT THEY COULD FLIP

13
00:00:16,736 --> 00:00:17,036
THEM.

14
00:00:17,036 --> 00:00:17,737
SOME MIGHT.

15
00:00:17,737 --> 00:00:18,805
SEVEN OF THOSE WERE CARRIED

16
00:00:18,805 --> 00:00:20,673
BY HILLARY IN 2016.

17
00:00:20,673 --> 00:00:21,541
DESPITE DEMOCRATS TARGETING

18
00:00:21,541 --> 00:00:22,308
THESE SEATS.

19
00:00:22,308 --> 00:00:24,143
SO FAR THEY FAILED TO

20
00:00:24,143 --> 00:00:25,111
ACHIEVE THE SO-CALLED BLUE

21
00:00:25,111 --> 00:00:27,113
WAVE OR BIG BLUE SHUTOUT

22
00:00:27,113 --> 00:00:28,348
BECAUSE OF THE SO-CALLED

23
00:00:28,348 --> 00:00:29,282
JUNGLE PRIMARY AND ALL SEVEN

24
00:00:29,282 --> 00:00:30,617
OF THE PRIMARIES A

25
00:00:30,617 --> 00:00:31,217
REPUBLICAN CANDIDATE HAS

26
00:00:31,217 --> 00:00:32,619
COME OUT AHEAD AND HAS A

27
00:00:32,619 --> 00:00:33,486
CHANCE TO WIN IN NOE.

28
00:00:33,486 --> 00:00:34,954
WHAT CAN WE LEARN MOVING

29
00:00:34,954 --> 00:00:35,755
FORWARD ABOUT THE ISSUES AND

30
00:00:35,755 --> 00:00:36,723
THE RESULTS?

31
00:00:36,723 --> 00:00:38,758
HERE TO DISCUSS IT IS FINE

32
00:00:38,758 --> 00:00:39,926
POLSTER PANEL WE HAVE LEE

33
00:00:39,926 --> 00:00:41,194
CARTER PLAYING OUTSIDE

34
00:00:41,194 --> 00:00:42,962
RIGHT.

35
00:00:42,962 --> 00:00:45,765
PLAYING IN THE SHAMANSKY AND

36
00:00:45,765 --> 00:00:46,132
PARTNERS.

37
00:00:46,132 --> 00:00:48,334
IN THE MIDDLE.

38
00:00:48,334 --> 00:00:49,435
DAVID BILL O'REILLY HERE

39
00:00:49,435 --> 00:00:53,906
CHIEF ELECTION ANALYST FOR

40
00:00:53,906 --> 00:00:54,507
THE "WEEKLY STANDARD."

41
00:00:54,507 --> 00:00:57,110
GIVE ME THE TWO MOST POPULAR

42
00:00:57,110 --> 00:00:57,777
CANDIDATES REGARDLESS OF THE

43
00:00:57,777 --> 00:00:58,144
PARTY.

44
00:00:58,144 --> 00:00:58,745
WHAT WERE THE RESULTS?

45
00:00:58,745 --> 00:01:00,380
>> THE RESULTS WERE NOT I

46
00:01:00,380 --> 00:01:01,080
THINK WHAT THE DEMOCRATS

47
00:01:01,080 --> 00:01:01,781
HOPES THEM TO BE.

48
00:01:01,781 --> 00:01:03,316
I THINK THE REPUBLICANS HELD

49
00:01:03,316 --> 00:01:04,050
STRONG WHERE THEY NEEDED TO

50
00:01:04,050 --> 00:01:05,418
AND THE DEMOCRATS DIDN'T DO

51
00:01:05,418 --> 00:01:08,187
AS WELL AS THEY HAD HOPED TO

52
00:01:08,187 --> 00:01:09,289
DO THAT'S IN LARGE PART

53
00:01:09,289 --> 00:01:10,356
BECAUSE THERE WAS A BIG

54
00:01:10,356 --> 00:01:14,260
DIVIDE BETWEEN THE DEMOCRATS

55
00:01:14,260 --> 00:01:15,628
I DON'T THINK WE SAW THE

56
00:01:15,628 --> 00:01:16,329
ALIGNMENT THEY WERE HOPING

57
00:01:16,329 --> 00:01:17,196
TO HAVE.

58
00:01:17,196 --> 00:01:18,131
ULTIMATELY I THINK IN

59
00:01:18,131 --> 00:01:18,731
CALIFORNIA THEY ARE NOT

60
00:01:18,731 --> 00:01:20,400
QUITE AS LEFT AS PEOPLE HAD

61
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:20,733
THOUGHT.

62
00:01:20,733 --> 00:01:22,035
THERE ARE ISSUES THAT ARE

63
00:01:22,035 --> 00:01:22,635
REALLY APPEALING ON THE

64
00:01:22,635 --> 00:01:23,903
REPUBLICAN SIDE AND THOSE

65
00:01:23,903 --> 00:01:26,372
ISSUES COME DOWN TO HOW THEY

66
00:01:26,372 --> 00:01:27,807
LOOK AT TRADE, SANCTUARY

67
00:01:27,807 --> 00:01:28,975
CITIES AND IMMIGRATION.

68
00:01:28,975 --> 00:01:31,311
REALLY HOPING IN CALIFORNIA

69
00:01:31,311 --> 00:01:34,147
FOR BIPARTISAN IMMIGRATION

70
00:01:34,147 --> 00:01:34,547
LEGISLATION.

71
00:01:34,547 --> 00:01:35,682
THREE OUT OF FOUR FOLKS ARE

72
00:01:35,682 --> 00:01:36,549
SAYING THAT'S WHAT THEY WANT

73
00:01:36,549 --> 00:01:37,016
TO SEE.

74
00:01:37,016 --> 00:01:38,217
>> THINK WANT TO SEE SOME

75
00:01:38,217 --> 00:01:38,985
TYPE OF DEAL MADE.

76
00:01:38,985 --> 00:01:39,585
>> THAT'S RIGHT.

77
00:01:39,585 --> 00:01:40,920
>> BOTH PARTIES ARE AFRAID

78
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:42,555
TO DO A DEAL, AREN'T THEY,

79
00:01:42,555 --> 00:01:42,855
ADAM?

80
00:01:42,855 --> 00:01:43,690
>> FIRST OF ALL, TO GO BACK

81
00:01:43,690 --> 00:01:45,658
TO THE JUNGLE PRIMARY FOR A

82
00:01:45,658 --> 00:01:45,992
SECOND.

83
00:01:45,992 --> 00:01:47,493
I THINK THE JUNGLE PRIMARIES

84
00:01:47,493 --> 00:01:49,829
ARE A TERRIBLE IDEA.

85
00:01:49,829 --> 00:01:51,397
CYNICAL ATTEMPT TO KIND OF

86
00:01:51,397 --> 00:01:52,799
RIG THE SYSTEM ALMOST, YOU

87
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:53,933
KNOW, YOU TAKE A VERY

88
00:01:53,933 --> 00:01:55,535
DEMOCRATIC STATE LIKE

89
00:01:55,535 --> 00:01:56,035
CALIFORNIA, SURE.

90
00:01:56,035 --> 00:01:57,403
THEY WOULD LOVE A JUNGLE

91
00:01:57,403 --> 00:01:57,737
PRIMARY.

92
00:01:57,737 --> 00:01:58,638
THEY WOULD LOVE TWO

93
00:01:58,638 --> 00:01:59,572
DEMOCRATS TO RUN AGAINST

94
00:01:59,572 --> 00:02:01,441
EACH OTHER IN A GENERAL.

95
00:02:01,441 --> 00:02:02,742
CUTTING OUT CHOICE, OKAY.

96
00:02:02,742 --> 00:02:03,976
AND IT'S JUST BETWEEN TWO

97
00:02:03,976 --> 00:02:05,311
DEMOCRATS NOW AND THERE IS

98
00:02:05,311 --> 00:02:07,380
NO REAL REPUBLICAN

99
00:02:07,380 --> 00:02:07,914
REPRESENTATION.

100
00:02:07,914 --> 00:02:08,481
BRIAN: JUST MOVING ON

101
00:02:08,481 --> 00:02:08,815
THOUGH?

102
00:02:08,815 --> 00:02:09,749
>> MOVING ON THOUGH, I HAVE

103
00:02:09,749 --> 00:02:11,150
GOT TO TELL YOU THOUGH, I

104
00:02:11,150 --> 00:02:12,652
THINK REPUBLICANS ARE

105
00:02:12,652 --> 00:02:13,019
ENERGIZED.

106
00:02:13,019 --> 00:02:14,187
THE PROBLEM IS JUST ONE OF

107
00:02:14,187 --> 00:02:14,520
NUMBERS.

108
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:15,922
IN A STATE LIKE CALIFORNIA,

109
00:02:15,922 --> 00:02:16,656
YOU KNOW, REPUBLICANS ARE

110
00:02:16,656 --> 00:02:17,657
JUST LIMITED.

111
00:02:17,657 --> 00:02:19,158
HAVE YOU GOT TO ATTRACT ALL

112
00:02:19,158 --> 00:02:19,859
THESE INDEPENDENT VOTERS WHO

113
00:02:19,859 --> 00:02:22,428
ARE NOW REGISTERING.

114
00:02:22,428 --> 00:02:24,297
BRIAN: LOOK AT ROHRABACHER'S

115
00:02:24,297 --> 00:02:25,698
SEAT AND ED ROYCE'S SEAT.

116
00:02:25,698 --> 00:02:26,733
THEY SHOULD BE RED.

117
00:02:26,733 --> 00:02:28,034
EVEN THOUGH THE STATE IS

118
00:02:28,034 --> 00:02:32,038
BLUE.

119
00:02:32,038 --> 00:02:32,538
RIGHT?

120
00:02:32,538 --> 00:02:34,841
>> RIGHT A LOT OF THESE

121
00:02:34,841 --> 00:02:36,476
SEATS ARE MID TRANSITION.

122
00:02:36,476 --> 00:02:39,078
DEFERRING RACIALLY AND

123
00:02:39,078 --> 00:02:39,712
ETHNICALLY AND AT THE SAME

124
00:02:39,712 --> 00:02:41,581
TIME THE DEMOCRATS BECOMING

125
00:02:41,581 --> 00:02:42,682
MORE URBANIZED PARTY.

126
00:02:42,682 --> 00:02:44,350
HAVE YOU THOSE TREND LINES

127
00:02:44,350 --> 00:02:45,418
POINTING IN THE DEMOCRATS'

128
00:02:45,418 --> 00:02:45,885
DIRECTION.

129
00:02:45,885 --> 00:02:46,919
OPPOSITE TREND LINES

130
00:02:46,919 --> 00:02:48,955
ELSEWHERE IN THE COUNTRY.

131
00:02:48,955 --> 00:02:50,523
OVERALL MY TAKE ON TUESDAY'S

132
00:02:50,523 --> 00:02:51,557
RESULTS IS THAT IT DIDN'T

133
00:02:51,557 --> 00:02:52,592
TELL US ANYTHING WE DIDN'T

134
00:02:52,592 --> 00:02:54,160
KNOW BY LOOKING AT THE

135
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:55,762
GENERIC BALLOT POLLS.

136
00:02:55,762 --> 00:02:56,396
PRESIDENTIAL APPROVAL AND

137
00:02:56,396 --> 00:02:58,998
SOME OF THESE OTHER NATIONAL

138
00:02:58,998 --> 00:02:59,465
INDICATORS.

139
00:02:59,465 --> 00:03:00,133
BRIAN: LEE, TELL ME WHAT

140
00:03:00,133 --> 00:03:00,833
DEMOCRATS SHOULD BE SAYING

141
00:03:00,833 --> 00:03:02,168
IN THE NEXT SIX MONTHS TO

142
00:03:02,168 --> 00:03:03,269
HELP THEM LOCK THE SEAT AND

143
00:03:03,269 --> 00:03:04,203
WHAT THE REPUBLICANS SHOULD

144
00:03:04,203 --> 00:03:06,672
BE SAYING TO HELP THEM LOCK

145
00:03:06,672 --> 00:03:07,206
THE SEAT.

146
00:03:07,206 --> 00:03:08,775
>> DEMOCRATS HAVE TO RUN TO

147
00:03:08,775 --> 00:03:12,145
THE MIDDLE NOT RESIST AT ALL

148
00:03:12,145 --> 00:03:12,478
COST.

149
00:03:12,478 --> 00:03:14,881
GAVIN NEWSOM RESIST WITH

150
00:03:14,881 --> 00:03:16,015
RESULTS, NOT ONE THAT IS

151
00:03:16,015 --> 00:03:16,983
GOING TO APPEAL.

152
00:03:16,983 --> 00:03:18,017
PEOPLE WANT TO SEE

153
00:03:18,017 --> 00:03:20,553
COMPROMISE AND ISSUES HAPPEN

154
00:03:20,553 --> 00:03:22,922
THAT ARE MORE IN THE MIDDLE.

155
00:03:22,922 --> 00:03:24,257
CONOR LAMB WAS A GOOD

156
00:03:24,257 --> 00:03:26,092
BLUEPRINT FOR WHAT A

157
00:03:26,092 --> 00:03:26,759
DEMOCRATIC CANDIDATE SHOULD

158
00:03:26,759 --> 00:03:27,927
LOOK LIKE IF THEY ARE GOING

159
00:03:27,927 --> 00:03:30,530
TO WIN IN THEIR DISTRICT.

160
00:03:30,530 --> 00:03:31,631
BRIAN: DEMOCRATS ARE SAYING

161
00:03:31,631 --> 00:03:36,436
STOP SAYING IMPEACH, RIGHT?

162
00:03:36,436 --> 00:03:38,638
PRESIDENT IS SAYING BRING IT

163
00:03:38,638 --> 00:03:38,905
UP.

164
00:03:38,905 --> 00:03:40,540
>> WE SEE PRESIDENT TRUMP'S

165
00:03:40,540 --> 00:03:42,341
APPROVAL RATING CLIMBING,

166
00:03:42,341 --> 00:03:43,075
CLIMBING, CLIMBING.

167
00:03:43,075 --> 00:03:44,343
THE ECONOMY GROWING.

168
00:03:44,343 --> 00:03:47,447
AT SOME POINT THIS

169
00:03:47,447 --> 00:03:49,482
IMPEACHMENT IS FALLING ON

170
00:03:49,482 --> 00:03:49,916
DEAF EARS.

171
00:03:49,916 --> 00:03:52,018
ONLY APPEALING TO THE MOST

172
00:03:52,018 --> 00:03:53,686
PARTISAN PROGRESSIVE LIBERAL

173
00:03:53,686 --> 00:03:54,053
RESISTER.

174
00:03:54,053 --> 00:03:54,887
THE REST OF THE COUNTRY

175
00:03:54,887 --> 00:03:56,889
DOESN'T WANT TO HEAR IT.

176
00:03:56,889 --> 00:03:58,090
BRIAN: DAVID, TIMELY, WHAT'S

177
00:03:58,090 --> 00:03:58,858
YOUR TAKE AWAY?

178
00:03:58,858 --> 00:04:01,327
>> FROM THE JUNE 5TH RHYME

179
00:04:01,327 --> 00:04:01,661
MARRIES?

180
00:04:01,661 --> 00:04:02,495
AGAIN, IT'S MOSTLY WHAT WE

181
00:04:02,495 --> 00:04:03,496
HAVE SEEN BEFORE.

182
00:04:03,496 --> 00:04:04,430
THE PARTY ESTABLISHMENT ON

183
00:04:04,430 --> 00:04:06,132
BOTH SIDES HAVE BEEN GETTING

184
00:04:06,132 --> 00:04:07,300
THE CANDIDATES WHAT THEY

185
00:04:07,300 --> 00:04:07,633
WANTED.

186
00:04:07,633 --> 00:04:08,568
YOU HAVE A DEMOCRATIC

187
00:04:08,568 --> 00:04:09,802
ADVANTAGE IN THE GENERIC

188
00:04:09,802 --> 00:04:10,136
BALLOT.

189
00:04:10,136 --> 00:04:11,103
WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE HOUSE

190
00:04:11,103 --> 00:04:12,205
VOTES, IT SORT OF SHAKES OUT

191
00:04:12,205 --> 00:04:13,506
IN A WAY THAT MAKES SENSE

192
00:04:13,506 --> 00:04:15,808
WITH THAT.

193
00:04:15,808 --> 00:04:17,577
A LOT HAS CHANGED OVER THE

194
00:04:17,577 --> 00:04:19,045
