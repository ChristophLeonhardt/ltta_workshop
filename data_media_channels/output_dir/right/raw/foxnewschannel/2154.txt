1
00:00:09,065 --> 00:00:09,966
>> Neil: PRESIDENT TRUMP IS FOND

2
00:00:09,966 --> 00:00:12,635
OF CALLING OUT THE MEDIA ON FAKE

3
00:00:12,635 --> 00:00:12,935
NEWS.

4
00:00:12,935 --> 00:00:14,771
BUT IS HE THE ONE GIVING THEM

5
00:00:14,771 --> 00:00:15,705
REAL AMMUNITION?

6
00:00:15,705 --> 00:00:16,973
MAYBE NOT INTENTIONALLY.

7
00:00:16,973 --> 00:00:18,941
I'LL GIVE YOU THE BENEFIT OF THE

8
00:00:18,941 --> 00:00:21,711
DOUBT, MR. PRESIDENT AND SAY NOT

9
00:00:21,711 --> 00:00:22,145
DELIBERATELY.

10
00:00:22,145 --> 00:00:23,546
BUT CONSISTENTLY.

11
00:00:23,546 --> 00:00:25,048
SO LET ME BE CLEAR,

12
00:00:25,048 --> 00:00:26,115
MR. PRESIDENT.

13
00:00:26,115 --> 00:00:28,351
HOW CAN YOU DRAIN THE SWAMP IF

14
00:00:28,351 --> 00:00:30,386
YOU'RE THE ONE THAT KEEPS

15
00:00:30,386 --> 00:00:30,920
MUDDYING THE WATERS?

16
00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:34,223
YOU DIDN'T KNOW ABOUT THE

17
00:00:34,223 --> 00:00:40,129
$130,000 PAYMENT TO A PORN STAR

18
00:00:40,129 --> 00:00:40,830
TILL YOU DID.

19
00:00:40,830 --> 00:00:42,231
YOU ACKNOWLEDGED TODAY YOU WERE

20
00:00:42,231 --> 00:00:43,766
THE GUY BEHIND THE RETAINER

21
00:00:43,766 --> 00:00:45,268
PAYMENT THAT TOOK CARE OF THIS.

22
00:00:45,268 --> 00:00:48,104
YOU INSIST THAT MONEY FROM THE

23
00:00:48,104 --> 00:00:49,906
CAMPAIGN OR CAMPAIGN

24
00:00:49,906 --> 00:00:51,507
CONTRIBUTIONS PLAYED NO ROLE IN

25
00:00:51,507 --> 00:00:52,208
THIS TRANSACTION.

26
00:00:52,208 --> 00:00:53,209
OF THAT YOU'RE SURE.

27
00:00:53,209 --> 00:00:55,645
THE THING IS, NOT 24 HOURS AGO,

28
00:00:55,645 --> 00:00:58,014
SIR, YOU COULDN'T RECALL ANY OF

29
00:00:58,014 --> 00:00:58,348
THIS.

30
00:00:58,348 --> 00:00:59,916
YOU SEEM VERY SURE.

31
00:00:59,916 --> 00:01:01,684
I'M NOT SAYING YOU'RE A LIAR.

32
00:01:01,684 --> 00:01:04,420
YOU'RE A PRESIDENT, YOU'RE BUSY.

33
00:01:04,420 --> 00:01:08,024
I'M HAVING A DEVIL OF A TIME

34
00:01:08,024 --> 00:01:09,759
FIGURING OUT WHICH NEWS IS FAKE.

35
00:01:09,759 --> 00:01:11,694
YOUR OWN WORDS GAVE ME LOTS OF

36
00:01:11,694 --> 00:01:11,994
PAUSE.

37
00:01:11,994 --> 00:01:13,930
LIKE THE TIME YOU SAID THE

38
00:01:13,930 --> 00:01:15,665
RUSSIANS DIDN'T INTERFERE IN THE

39
00:01:15,665 --> 00:01:17,333
2016 ELECTIONS UNTIL THE

40
00:01:17,333 --> 00:01:18,568
REPUBLICANS HAD TO REMIND YOU

41
00:01:18,568 --> 00:01:19,102
THEY DID.

42
00:01:19,102 --> 00:01:21,170
MONTHS LATER, YOU SAID, WELL, I

43
00:01:21,170 --> 00:01:22,372
NEVER SAID THAT RUSSIA DIDN'T

44
00:01:22,372 --> 00:01:24,841
MEDDLE IN THE ELECTION WHEN IN

45
00:01:24,841 --> 00:01:26,209
FACT YOU HAD A LOT.

46
00:01:26,209 --> 00:01:28,344
NONE OF THIS MAKES ME A NEVER

47
00:01:28,344 --> 00:01:28,911
TRUMPER.

48
00:01:28,911 --> 00:01:31,247
JUST CONFUSED.

49
00:01:31,247 --> 00:01:32,715
WHEN YOU CLAIMS YOUR TAX CUT WAS

50
00:01:32,715 --> 00:01:40,289
IN THE BIGGEST IN HISTORY WHEN

51
00:01:40,289 --> 00:01:43,092
IT WASN'T.

52
00:01:43,092 --> 00:01:47,130
OR THAT YOUR JOB ISN'T THAT BAD

53
00:01:47,130 --> 00:01:48,898
RELATIVE TO OTHER PRESIDENTS.

54
00:01:48,898 --> 00:01:50,166
THEY'RE WORSE THAN MOST

55
00:01:50,166 --> 00:01:52,869
PRESIDENTS AT THIS STAGE.

56
00:01:52,869 --> 00:01:55,138
THAT CAN CHANGE, BUT WHAT IS

57
00:01:55,138 --> 00:01:56,606
WEIRD, THE PATTERN DOES NOT.

58
00:01:56,606 --> 00:01:58,708
LIKE THE TIME YOU SAY RUMORS OF

59
00:01:58,708 --> 00:02:01,444
REX TILLERSON'S DEPARTURE AT THE

60
00:02:01,444 --> 00:02:02,512
STATEMENT DEPARTMENT WERE FALSE

61
00:02:02,512 --> 00:02:04,280
UNTIL THEY WEREN'T.

62
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:06,249
OR YOUR FORMER CHIEF OF STAFF,

63
00:02:06,249 --> 00:02:07,950
LANCE PRIEBUS WASN'T GOING

64
00:02:07,950 --> 00:02:08,584
ANYWHERE UNTIL HE WAS.

65
00:02:08,584 --> 00:02:11,387
OUR YOUR ECONOMIC ADVISER, GARY

66
00:02:11,387 --> 00:02:13,689
COHN, WAS DOING A GREAT JOB

67
00:02:13,689 --> 00:02:14,424
UNTIL HE WASN'T.

68
00:02:14,424 --> 00:02:17,627
WHEN YOU LOVE STEVE BANNON UNTIL

69
00:02:17,627 --> 00:02:18,127
YOU DIDN'T.

70
00:02:18,127 --> 00:02:19,896
SWORE BY JEFF SESSIONS UNTIL YOU

71
00:02:19,896 --> 00:02:20,930
SWORE AT HIM.

72
00:02:20,930 --> 00:02:21,964
HAD YOU REMEMBER LEGAL TEAM

73
00:02:21,964 --> 00:02:23,032
LOCKED IN PLACE UNTIL IT WAS

74
00:02:23,032 --> 00:02:23,533
PRESIDENT.

75
00:02:23,533 --> 00:02:25,067
DENIED REPORTS THAT YOU WERE

76
00:02:25,067 --> 00:02:26,803
EVER THINKING ABOUT FIRING

77
00:02:26,803 --> 00:02:28,070
ROBERT MUELLER EVEN AS YOU NOW

78
00:02:28,070 --> 00:02:29,906
THREAT TO GET INVOLVED AT THE

79
00:02:29,906 --> 00:02:30,473
JUSTICE DEPARTMENT.

80
00:02:30,473 --> 00:02:32,875
NOBODY OF THIS MAKES YOU EVIL.

81
00:02:32,875 --> 00:02:35,144
I'M SURE YOU CAN UNDERSTAND WHY

82
00:02:35,144 --> 00:02:37,413
EVEN YOUR FRIENDS SAY THESE

83
00:02:37,413 --> 00:02:38,181
INCONSISTENCIES DON'T MAKE YOU

84
00:02:38,181 --> 00:02:40,049
LOOK GOOD OR DO ANYTHING TO HELP

85
00:02:40,049 --> 00:02:43,052
ADVANCE YOUR POLICIES, MANY OF

86
00:02:43,052 --> 00:02:44,587
WHICH ARE VERY GOOD OR THE

87
00:02:44,587 --> 00:02:45,922
PROSPECTS FOR PEACE WITH NORTH

88
00:02:45,922 --> 00:02:46,722
KOREA.

89
00:02:46,722 --> 00:02:48,191
THAT IS REMARKABLY GOOD.

90
00:02:48,191 --> 00:02:50,293
ALL OF THIS STUFF YOU KEEP

91
00:02:50,293 --> 00:02:53,496
BLURTING OUT REMARKABLY BAD

92
00:02:53,496 --> 00:02:53,830
TIMING.

93
00:02:53,830 --> 00:02:55,932
IT'S NOT THAT THESE

94
00:02:55,932 --> 00:02:58,067
EXAGGERATIONS AND OMISSIONS AND

95
00:02:58,067 --> 00:02:59,535
MISSTATEMENTS ARE NOW AND THEN.

96
00:02:59,535 --> 00:03:01,504
MORE LIKE NOW AND THEN SOMETHING

97
00:03:01,504 --> 00:03:02,472
ELSE, ALWAYS SOMETHING ELSE.

98
00:03:02,472 --> 00:03:04,373
LIKE THE TIME YOU CLAIMED YOU

99
00:03:04,373 --> 00:03:05,475
SIGNED MORE BILLS THAN ANY

100
00:03:05,475 --> 00:03:07,710
PRESIDENT EVER, NEGLECTING TO

101
00:03:07,710 --> 00:03:11,747
MENTION THE OTHER FOUR

102
00:03:11,747 --> 00:03:16,886
PRESIDENTS THAT SIGNED MORE.

103
00:03:16,886 --> 00:03:22,492
BRAGGED ABOUT THE NATIONAL DEBT

104
00:03:22,492 --> 00:03:23,659
BEING DOWN AND IT'S SOARED.

105
00:03:23,659 --> 00:03:25,194
IT'S NOT WHAT YOU'RE OMITTING.

106
00:03:25,194 --> 00:03:26,929
IT'S WHAT YOU KEEP STATING AND

107
00:03:26,929 --> 00:03:27,630
NEVER CORRECTING.

108
00:03:27,630 --> 00:03:30,600
LIKE WHEN YOU SAID THERE WAS A

109
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:31,534
SERIOUS VOTER FRAUD IN

110
00:03:31,534 --> 00:03:33,236
NEW HAMPSHIRE AND THERE WASN'T.

111
00:03:33,236 --> 00:03:35,171
THE SAME ABOUT REPEATED CLAIMS

112
00:03:35,171 --> 00:03:38,207
OF VOTER FRAUD IN VIRGINIA OR

113
00:03:38,207 --> 00:03:39,575
THERE WEREN'T.

114
00:03:39,575 --> 00:03:41,410
MILLIONS OF ILLEGALS VOTED IN

115
00:03:41,410 --> 00:03:43,679
THE LAST ELECTION AND THEY

116
00:03:43,679 --> 00:03:44,013
DIDN'T.

117
00:03:44,013 --> 00:03:45,815
AND WHEN YOU TALKED UP YOUR

118
00:03:45,815 --> 00:03:49,252
MASSIVE LANDSLIDE IN THE

119
00:03:49,252 --> 00:03:51,387
ELECTORAL COLLEGE BUT THERE

120
00:03:51,387 --> 00:03:52,355
WASN'T.

121
00:03:52,355 --> 00:03:54,891
AGAIN, NONE OF THIS MAKES WHAT

122
00:03:54,891 --> 00:03:55,791
YOU SAY FAKE.

123
00:03:55,791 --> 00:03:57,927
JUST CALLING OUT THE PRESSER

124
00:03:57,927 --> 00:03:59,862
BEING SO OF A BIT OF A STRETCH.

125
00:03:59,862 --> 00:04:01,430
YOU'RE RIGHT TO SAY SOME OF THEM

126
00:04:01,430 --> 00:04:02,965
ARE OUT TO GET YOU.

127
00:04:02,965 --> 00:04:05,134
OFTENTIMES THEY'RE USING YOUR

128
00:04:05,134 --> 00:04:07,436
OWN WORDS TO BASH YOU.

129
00:04:07,436 --> 00:04:10,006
YOUR BASE PROBABLY MIGHT NOT

130
00:04:10,006 --> 00:04:10,306
CARE.

131
00:04:10,306 --> 00:04:11,073
BUT YOU SHOULD.

132
00:04:11,073 --> 00:04:15,444
I GUESS YOU'RE TOO BUSY DRAINING

133
00:04:15,444 --> 00:04:16,812
THE SWAM TOP STOP AND SMELL THE

134
00:04:16,812 --> 00:04:20,116
STINK YOU'RE CREATING.

135
00:04:20,249 --> 00:00:00,000
THAT'S YOUR STINK.
