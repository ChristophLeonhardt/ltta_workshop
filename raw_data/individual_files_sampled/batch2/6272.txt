November 1st it marked the first day of open enrollment for Obamacare under the federal health insurance exchange and the numbers that we're seeing may actually come as somewhat of a surprise to Republicans so we're actually seeing a surge in Obamacare signups even as Democrats feared that there might be a decrease after the Trump administrate get administration excuse me significantly cut back on Obamacare ads the administration cut the outreach budget by ninety percent but take a look at these numbers we'll put a graphic up there on the screen for you the hill is reporting the source close to the enrollment process reveals a hundred thousand people signed up this time last year and and now we're looking at this year we're looking at two hundred thousand have selected a plan for 2018 and then judging the traffic on healthcare.gov on November first last year we had 750 thousand whereas a million people have visited healthcare.gov this year important to note that the enrollment period has been cut in half by the Trump administration so it's only lasting for 45 days this year ending on December 15th do you guys think that by pulling back the outreach budget that actually is what do you think is the cause of the surge in numbers could that have been part of this cause I do think it has something to do with the uncertainty of people wondering what is going to the fate of the health care system as it is now I did see something that said signups early in the enrollment season are often people renewing their coverage not new enrollees but we do see that all those hits to the website show that there is a peaked level of interest at least at least interests yeah at least at least there's interest and now the question is will that roll over into people going to their locally elected officials publicly elected officials and asking for a change in what we see this administration rolling back and some of the again some of these insane cuts out cutting that outreach budget by 90% is real I mean that's like you're gutting they're gutting it they're going health care right now and we'll have to see if this increased interest perhaps leads to a change I have to say I think that this is I think it's not enough I think this is you know I mean what what the Trump administration wants is for Obamacare to fail and unfortunately these numbers aren't encouraging enough for me to make a hard line and say that Obamacare isn't fail yes yeah it's at the beginning but this is the thing I think we a lot of times underestimate the things that Donald Trump says is actually promoting he's big on promotion and saying what he's gonna do and he says something he's entertainer by listens oh my god if I could my face out there is gonna be get PR he's been talking to he and Republicans even before when he came in I've been talking about shutting down Obamacare and how unpopular it is and how everyone hates Obama and they keep talking about it so they've already they've already promoted it so much more than having when they cut down on the funding that goes out and tells people about it they're promoting it way larger than anyone else would have before so even people who support him we've had these kinds of polls before where people support the president but then when it comes to the real things that affect their lives they they still want their Medicare they still want their programs they're like well yeah you're not gonna take away what I need so even people who support him on the surface still go and be like well yeah my knees hurting the doctor a very important point a very good rule of thumb in politics that almost is always true is that any expansion of the welfare state whether it's Social Security or Medicare or anything like this once it metastasizes and takes hold within the population becomes very popular and very difficult to rollback I mean Social Security was enacted in the 1960s and despite the fact that you know there's been bipartisan agreement amongst the leads to cut Social Security for as long as I've been watching politics they've been unable to because voters like it and it's one of the few things that they're able to you know because it's a check in the mail that they get every month right so the expansion of Obamacare as sort of compromised and has you know kind of half measure even though was a Republican method all the all the problems with Obamacare it was still an expansion of the welfare state that does help people in their day to day lives that shows that despite the vicious attacks from the right with which is why they're so desperate to roll it back before it really takes hold it just shows that it's remarkably popular despite sort of you know a full-scale media attack from the right so you know this is why Republicans are always so afraid of any sort of expansion to the welfare state that's why they they all they're always looking to cut it back as much as possible because once it takes hold it's very very difficult I think what you said grace where we're getting towards the end of the year here and there is seemingly a source of a sort of panic or anxiety about what the future of health care in this country is and I mean Republicans still haven't delivered on their promise to to repeal and replace Obamacare which is something that they have been banging the drum about for for several years down
