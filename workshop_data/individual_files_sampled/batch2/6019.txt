Donald Trump is apparently given the Secretary of Defense full autonomous control to set troop levels in Afghanistan which actually follows a trend we know that months ago he took off much of the the civilian sort of independent oversight of air strikes being launched in places like Syria and Afghanistan we know what effect that's had there have been far more dead civilians in the wake of that policy change than before it and many are concerned about this change in terms of uh Afghanistan I mean we're supposed to have civilian control of the military here in the US and it seems like Donald Trump not too interested in continuing that which perhaps under Trump is okay but going forward when we have other presidents uh I would hope that we would re-establish that long-standing tradition as well one more way that Trump Care could theoretically screw you over uh it is likely that in the final version that the Senate will vote on will be an elimination of the elimination on annual and lifetime spending caps on your insurance so basically under Obama care they couldn't say if you go over a certain dollar amount in one year over the course of your life that you cap out and can't have any more benefits any more uh it's likely that those caps will return and it will affect a lot of people it's estimated that annual limits could hit 27 million Americans every year and the lifetime caps will hit at least 20 million and think about what would have to happen to you for you to hit those lifetime caps I mean that means that you've had horrific accidents or some sort of serious chronic illness for a number of years and suddenly your insurance could be 100% worthless so look forward to that if the Senate actually does vote in favor of Trump care was talking to uh of all people uh pop this morning uh so that I got lifetime limits on so I immediately showered but then after that uh no um uh uh but we were discussing how what the Democrats need to do regarding the AHCA is that was is um because there's the argument of course that and all this Russia talk that that did perhaps you could argue that that the the focus on Russia is allowing issues that is allowing the Republicans to do things like sort of without it with seemingly without enough people paying attention have the Senate pass a version of the AHCA muscle I mean look Claire McCaskill we played a video so we've returned Obama I mean obviously cover about here and HC many times which is the past week probably three to five times and uh we showed last week Claire McCaskill was pushing for them to commit to open hearings she's trying and they just refused to do is they're don't care it's like it but I mean I would do it I would recommend that there'd be like a moratorium that the Democrats acknowledge like hey for the next five days the media was talk about a fine we're not talking about Russia because we're not gonna let them do this well look I think that would be great move I think anything that puts more pressure sort of did to every Democrat on every show this weekend says I'm not talking about Russia's weekend because what this what they're about to do is outrageous and have wire that I think we share but it needs to be a cohesive thought out strategy like Indiana needs I think to be big yeah and then you can go back and talk about a Russian fact should go back and don't know well I would support that I know that you watching the show necessarily you can't force them to do or not do anything but of course you can put pressure on your senators regardless of whether you come from blue or red state you can call into the Senate switchboard and put pressure on them I read reports today that Lisa Murkowski is apparently very uncomfortable about the current state of the HCA which means that perhaps with a little bit of pressure she can be pushed to do the right thing but actually in reference to yesterday's news of the tragic shooting near the Capitol a Republican congressman introduced a bill today that would allow those with concealed carry permits from their home states to exercise concealed carry inside of the District of Columbia now of course the obvious reaction should be I think this wouldn't have had any effect on what happened yesterday since even those who exercised concealed carry probably don't carry their guns onto a baseball field but this is the response that we will see after every mass shooting more gun rights more gun sales it's the solution that never actually solves anything and a great and uh you know what just it you know we don't need everyone's uh hot take on something like this right after this happens you know so I'm not I'm not advocating that this is not the right time talking about gun control when you have a mass shooting exactly the right times talk about gun control but uh well we don't have all the information yet when we are unclear on the extent of Steve Scalise is injuries when we don't know exactly what happened again there the degree I was awake and following on Twitter and then on websites when it happened yesterday uh uh since it was up very early and and just a number of things that were reported in the first hour many of them turned out to be wrong yeah first two three four five hours abscess people really need to calm down the first hours hold on a sec the story's not going anywhere in your your incredibly valuable take on it uh will be okay tomorrow exactly yeah yeah I don't think you're actually allowed to correctly identify the person commits an act like this until you've dragged one or two completely innocent people through the social media grinder and that happened in this case as well I'm finally a you probably remember from less than a month ago uh the Turkish president was in DC there was a protest outside of the place that he was staying and then while other people attacked the protesters his security forces also ran out and began beating peaceful protesters thankfully arrest warrants have now been issued for members of President arrow on security detail uh they're also warrants out for two Americans as well I think they're slightly more likely to get those two people than the security forces but it is good that they are actually taking some action on this we can't encourage the security forces of foreign dignitaries to begin beating people they disagree with not Leslie let's go leave that to Turkey they can do it make sure that they will but yeah uh so that's a good step although we don't know if it'll actually result in any action membership helps fund the Young Turks you know one great thing about that that means we're not accountable to anyone but you guys that's why we're strong together because we built the show around you come build it
