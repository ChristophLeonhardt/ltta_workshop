1
00:00:08,520 --> 00:00:09,910
“ooh, my goodness.”

2
00:00:09,910 --> 00:00:10,820
But in college,

3
00:00:21,980 --> 00:00:27,760
In a 2015 NCAA survey, female hockey players
reported concussions more often than male

4
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:28,980
football players.

5
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:34,180
And that’s consistent with previous surveys
showing women’s ice hockey on par with men’s

6
00:00:34,180 --> 00:00:36,440
wrestling, football, and hockey.

7
00:00:36,860 --> 00:00:37,640
“ohhh!”

8
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:43,800
So, compared to other athletes, why do women
playing hockey have such a high rate of concussion?

9
00:00:46,100 --> 00:00:52,359
“So I was a full-time student at Harvard
playing Division 1 hockey for my school team

10
00:00:52,359 --> 00:00:54,760
and leaving school for different stints."

11
00:00:54,760 --> 00:00:57,100
“Pucci flipshot and a score!!"

12
00:00:57,100 --> 00:00:58,120
"Josephine Pucci...”

13
00:00:58,180 --> 00:00:59,880
“...third goal of the year for Josephine
Pucci…”

14
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:04,120
“The morning of a couple gold medal
games for the world championships, I was submitting

15
00:01:04,120 --> 00:01:10,360
papers that had to be submitted for school
and then would suit up in the USA jersey that evening."

16
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:12,860
“Number 24, Josephine Pucci”

17
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:17,900
In 2014, Josephine Pucci won a silver medal
at the Sochi winter Olympics,

18
00:01:17,900 --> 00:01:20,160
but she almost didn’t make it.

19
00:01:20,220 --> 00:01:24,460
“ I got my concussion ten months before
Olympic tryouts and

20
00:01:24,460 --> 00:01:29,360
I remember just, kind of, being on my
elbows looking at the bench and...

21
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:35,260
“...I was so close to, you know, hoping
to reach my lifelong goal of hopefully competing

22
00:01:35,260 --> 00:01:39,340
in the Olympics and then suddenly I was in
a position where I wasn’t sure if I would

23
00:01:39,340 --> 00:01:41,840
be able to attend tryouts because of symptoms.”

24
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:46,580
After overcoming her injury to play Sochi,
Pucci returned to school and decided to end

25
00:01:46,580 --> 00:01:47,750
her hockey career.

26
00:01:47,750 --> 00:01:53,619
“...making that phone call...that I’d
be stepping away...was one of the hardest

27
00:01:53,619 --> 00:02:01,380
things I’d ever done...but after I called
and spoke with them at USA Hockey it just

28
00:02:01,380 --> 00:02:02,760
felt so right.”

29
00:02:02,780 --> 00:02:05,880
Compared to college sports like basketball
or tennis,

30
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:09,180
Ice hockey is faster,
played on harder surfaces,

31
00:02:09,180 --> 00:02:11,380
And involves more collisions.

32
00:02:12,700 --> 00:02:15,870
Which explains part of why players are getting
concussions,

33
00:02:15,870 --> 00:02:19,580
But answering the other part, “why women?”,
is less intuitive

34
00:02:19,580 --> 00:02:21,730
because it isn’t only hockey.

35
00:02:21,730 --> 00:02:23,180
In soccer,
basketball,

36
00:02:23,180 --> 00:02:27,680
and other comparable men’s sports,
women have a higher rate of concussion.

37
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:30,330
In fact, all the experts I talked to agreed
that

38
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:38,880
What experts can’t agree on, is why...

39
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:42,320
“Females athletes are more knowledgeable about signs and symptoms..”

40
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:44,600
for me, neck strength is a big component…”

41
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:46,200
"where a woman is in her period,"

42
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:47,560
"of course the style, level of play"

43
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:50,200
"X differences between the structures of these nerve fibers"

44
00:02:50,460 --> 00:02:52,660
But there are some common factors researchers

45
00:02:52,660 --> 00:02:55,240
point to: “a lot of people forget that this"

46
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:57,720
is also based upon reporting.

47
00:02:57,720 --> 00:03:03,620
Zachary Kerr authored the 2015 NCAA survey
and now researches concussions at the University

48
00:03:03,620 --> 00:03:04,620
of North Carolina.

49
00:03:04,620 --> 00:03:10,640
So, it may not be the fact that men are sustaining
less concussions than women.

50
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:15,620
Maybe women may have a better knowledge
of concussions. Perhaps we as men are more

51
00:03:15,629 --> 00:03:20,290
stubborn with our healthcare. Women are more
likely to disclose issues in general and we

52
00:03:20,290 --> 00:03:24,049
are just seeing that transferred over to the
topic of concussions.

53
00:03:24,049 --> 00:03:28,310
Besides a willingness to report, social bias
can still be a factor.

54
00:03:28,310 --> 00:03:30,049
“It’s not just about the individual.

55
00:03:30,049 --> 00:03:35,489
It’s also about his or her interpersonal
relationships with teammates, with their parents,

56
00:03:35,489 --> 00:03:36,489
with the coaches.

57
00:03:36,489 --> 00:03:42,090
So, for men, the cultural, social gender roles
are that we can be aggressive,

58
00:03:42,090 --> 00:03:47,190
But, for women, there’s always that stereotype
of them having to follow that rule of being

59
00:03:47,190 --> 00:03:48,950
sugar, spice and everything nice.

60
00:03:48,950 --> 00:03:56,250
“A lot of times that's said in a sort of
negative connotation type of way, as if women are

61
00:03:56,250 --> 00:04:02,220
weaker for reporting symptoms and that’s
something that I just really disagree with and

62
00:04:02,220 --> 00:04:07,230
I feel like, if women are in fact reporting
symptoms at a higher rate than men then they

63
00:04:07,230 --> 00:04:08,409
should be applauded for that.

64
00:04:08,409 --> 00:04:11,740
You don’t show how tough you are by playing
through concussion symptoms.”

65
00:04:12,260 --> 00:04:17,740
Another factor is style of play. Because unlike
the men’s game, which allows checking, it

66
00:04:17,750 --> 00:04:19,610
isn’t legal in women’s hockey.

67
00:04:19,610 --> 00:04:23,020
When they’re children, girls and boys play
by the same rules,

68
00:04:23,020 --> 00:04:26,920
but when they turn into teenagers, boys are
allowed to start checking.

69
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:29,250
There’s even a manual for it.

70
00:04:30,140 --> 00:04:34,080
“That’s the biggest difference between
men and women, is the checking,

71
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:40,600
But, when I played boys hockey, I played checking
and I don’t think I ever had a concussion

72
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:42,030
playing boys hockey.

73
00:04:42,030 --> 00:04:46,540
By college, men learn to be on the lookout,
which doesn’t mean female players avoid

74
00:04:46,540 --> 00:04:49,910
contact, but they might focus on speed and skill

75
00:04:49,910 --> 00:04:52,200
instead of anticipating being hit on the ice.

76
00:04:52,820 --> 00:04:56,980
"Every time I had the puck, I was ready to brace myself for a hit.

77
00:04:56,980 --> 00:04:59,380
You were forced to keep your head on a swivel.

78
00:04:59,380 --> 00:05:01,780
Whereas with the women, you're not supposed to be getting hit."

79
00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:04,380
"I don't know if it necessarily falls on not being

80
00:05:04,380 --> 00:05:11,840
‘taught’ the right way, but I think part of it is definitely
not being instilled with this idea of constantly

81
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:14,700
being prepared for body contact.”

82
00:05:15,010 --> 00:05:20,460
"Beyond sociocultural factors, researchers are
asking whether the explanation could be biological.

83
00:05:20,470 --> 00:05:25,040
There’s also the physiological aspects that
need to be explored."

84
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:27,610
Things such as: neck strength,
hormones,

85
00:05:27,610 --> 00:05:30,610
the neurostructural aspects as well.

86
00:05:30,610 --> 00:05:34,720
So far, scientific answers aren’t conclusive,
but that shouldn’t prevent change in the

87
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:35,720
meantime.

88
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:39,760
"We can make changes now, until the science
catches up

89
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:42,990
in regards to what factors are really contributing

90
00:05:42,990 --> 00:05:46,410
to the vulnerabilities of, you know, getting
head injuries.”

91
00:05:46,410 --> 00:05:49,600
In the NFL, advanced research,

92
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:50,600
Rule changes,

93
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:51,600
“Hitting a runner in the helmet area”

94
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:52,670
And injury protocols

95
00:05:52,670 --> 00:05:54,630
“...undoubtedly going through concussion
protocol…”

96
00:05:54,630 --> 00:05:59,140
Only became possible once the league acknowledged
data linking football to brain injuries.

97
00:06:00,180 --> 00:06:04,080
For female hockey players in college,
there’s a similar need for change.

98
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:10,780
“A lot of times I get the question, ‘would
you let your kids play ice hockey’ and my

99
00:06:10,780 --> 00:06:15,180
answer may beat around the bush to a certain
extent but it’s usually: Well, I hope by

100
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:17,840
the time I have kids that we’ll know more.”

101
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:20,300
That's the end of this video, but

102
00:06:20,300 --> 00:06:22,620
there's a lot more I wish I could have covered here,

103
00:06:22,620 --> 00:06:27,620
so I'm gonna leave some links below, where you can find more information about the research that's being done,

104
00:06:27,620 --> 00:06:30,740
as well as resources for anyone that's interested in the topic.

105
00:06:30,740 --> 00:00:00,000
Thanks for watching.
