Berlin authorities have circulated a brochure among kindergarten staff that focuses on such issues as transgender identity and same-sex marriage the booklet designed to help teachers explain these sensitive topics to children has certainly sparked some controversy Peter Oliver picks up the story Berlin is a city famed for its liberal and inclusive attitudes to sex and sexuality but conservatives in the German capital are upset at a new guide for kindergarten teachers that they say goes into too much detail and is aimed at kids that are too young the idea is to give educators the information they need to be sensitive to children coming from non-binary families say children that have same-sex parents or transgender parents it doesn't have the most catchy of names but what it has done certainly ruffle some feathers among those in Angela Merkel's CDU party children should be allowed to be children and not be confronted with things like these it's also come in for criticism from the opposition alternative for Germany party well it's very simple we believe sex education is important and of course a young young adult should know about sex family planning and all the rest but please not in the kindergarten give them some space let them be children don't force this issue onto them it's not even a problem for them they want to play around they want to discover the world so please let them be children leave them alone these subjects will come to them soon enough in school or at home and the parents talk about this but not at an age of five or six years that is far too early on the streets of Berlin opinion is mixed on when is the right time to be discussing with children issues of sexuality do you think that children in kindergarten should be taught about same-sex couples and about transgender people yes because it's so normal nowadays to to be with people surrounded by people in all gender conditions or no gender sexualities and all this stuff I don't think it's the right age I think when they receive sex education in school that's you know I think that's thinking in the one hand I think it's okay on the other and I don't I'm very much in favor of that idea so yes I do and why I think it's the important factor of life so I think children should be taught about all factors of life and this is just one of them the left-wing coalition of the Social Democrats greens and the Left Party that runs Berlin city government are accusing those on the right wing of politics have been overly prudish and unwilling to discuss the issue after their attempt to scandalize the handouts on sexual and gender diversity for teachers didn't work the CDU would prefer not to talk about the issue there's very little chance of the Berlin City Government repealing this booklet however discussions over sex and sexuality and talking about it in kindergarten are set to continue in fact there's a petition going round that has already almost 50,000 signatures from those who want to see this particular booklet stopped Peter Oliver RT Berlin
