1
00:00:01,982 --> 00:00:02,782
TUCKER.

2
00:00:02,783 --> 00:00:03,450
>> Tucker: TRACE GALLAGHER,

3
00:00:03,451 --> 00:00:05,652
THANKS FOR THAT.

4
00:00:05,653 --> 00:00:07,821
THE PIPE BOMBS OF COURSE ARE ONE

5
00:00:07,822 --> 00:00:11,758
OF MANY EXAMPLES OF ATTEMPTED

6
00:00:11,759 --> 00:00:12,992
AND ACTUAL POLITICAL VIOLENCE

7
00:00:12,993 --> 00:00:13,827
WE'D SEEN.

8
00:00:13,828 --> 00:00:16,396
ONE OF THE MOST NOTABLE WAS A

9
00:00:16,397 --> 00:00:18,031
ATTEMPTED MASSACRE IN THE SUMMER

10
00:00:18,032 --> 00:00:22,535
OF 2017, SO CONGRESSMAN STEVE

11
00:00:22,536 --> 00:00:24,003
SCALISE WAS GRAZED THOUGH MY

12
00:00:24,004 --> 00:00:24,471
GRAVELY WOUNDED.

13
00:00:24,472 --> 00:00:25,438
IN RESPONSE TO THE PIPE BY

14
00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:27,540
MAILING HE TWEETED "THESE

15
00:00:27,541 --> 00:00:28,742
ATTEMPTED ATTACKS THAT HAVE BEEN

16
00:00:28,743 --> 00:00:30,777
MADE OR BEYOND CRIMINAL, THEY

17
00:00:30,778 --> 00:00:31,811
ARE ACTS OF TERROR.

18
00:00:31,812 --> 00:00:33,480
IT VIOLENCE AND TERROR HAVE NO

19
00:00:33,481 --> 00:00:34,114
PLACE IN OUR POLITICS OR

20
00:00:34,115 --> 00:00:36,483
ANYWHERE ELSE IN OUR SOCIETY.

21
00:00:36,484 --> 00:00:38,451
THE CONGRESSMAN JOINS US

22
00:00:38,452 --> 00:00:38,818
TONIGHT.

23
00:00:38,819 --> 00:00:39,986
THANKS VERY MUCH FOR COMING ON.

24
00:00:39,987 --> 00:00:41,921
WHAT WAS YOUR FIRST REACTION

25
00:00:41,922 --> 00:00:47,627
WHEN YOU SAW THIS NEWS TODAY?

26
00:00:47,628 --> 00:00:49,796
>> ITS ANGER.

27
00:00:49,797 --> 00:00:51,297
THIS ISN'T THE WAY THAT WE

28
00:00:51,298 --> 00:00:52,632
SHOULD EXPECT AMERICA TO BE

29
00:00:52,633 --> 00:00:52,999
TURNING.

30
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,868
YOU ARE SEEING MORE AND MORE OF

31
00:00:54,869 --> 00:00:55,602
THIS AND CLEARLY YOU ARE SEEING

32
00:00:55,603 --> 00:00:57,937
IT ON BOTH SIDES.

33
00:00:57,938 --> 00:00:59,372
WE ALL NEED TO BE CALLING IT

34
00:00:59,373 --> 00:00:59,639
OUT.

35
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:00,874
OBVIOUSLY WE NEED TO FIND OUT

36
00:01:00,875 --> 00:01:01,941
WHAT HAPPENED IN THE FBI IS IN

37
00:01:01,942 --> 00:01:02,742
THE PROCESS OF DOING IT.

38
00:01:02,743 --> 00:01:05,779
I FEEL VERY CONFIDENT THAT OUR

39
00:01:05,780 --> 00:01:06,479
LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICIALS ARE

40
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:07,414
ULTIMATELY GOING TO FIND OUT WHO

41
00:01:07,415 --> 00:01:10,049
DID THIS AND IF IT'S ONE OR

42
00:01:10,050 --> 00:01:11,117
MULTIPLE PEOPLE, TO BRING THEM

43
00:01:11,118 --> 00:01:11,851
TO JUSTICE AND DO IT AS SWIFTLY

44
00:01:11,852 --> 00:01:13,553
AS POSSIBLE.

45
00:01:13,554 --> 00:01:15,021
>> Tucker: 'S OF THE CONDEMNED

46
00:01:15,022 --> 00:01:18,591
THESE ACTS AND WAS IMMEDIATELY

47
00:01:18,592 --> 00:01:19,325
REBUKED BY THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY

48
00:01:19,326 --> 00:01:20,427
FORWARD CONDEMNING THE ACTS NOT

49
00:01:20,428 --> 00:01:22,629
QUITE ENOUGH, WHAT YOU MAKE OF

50
00:01:22,630 --> 00:01:25,231
THAT?

51
00:01:25,232 --> 00:01:26,399
>> I THOUGHT THAT WAS A MISTAKE

52
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:28,001
ON THEIR PART TO CRITICIZE THE

53
00:01:28,002 --> 00:01:28,435
PRESIDENT.

54
00:01:28,436 --> 00:01:29,736
I THINK IT WAS IMPORTANT TO THE

55
00:01:29,737 --> 00:01:30,603
PRESIDENT DID COME OUT WITH A

56
00:01:30,604 --> 00:01:32,071
STATEMENT THE WAY HE DID,

57
00:01:32,072 --> 00:01:32,439
STRONGLY.

58
00:01:32,440 --> 00:01:35,675
I HEARD SILENCE A LOT OF TIMES

59
00:01:35,676 --> 00:01:37,177
WHEN REPUBLICANS WERE UNDER

60
00:01:37,178 --> 00:01:38,478
ATTACK FROM DEMOCRAT LEADERS.

61
00:01:38,479 --> 00:01:40,513
WE ALL SHOULD BE CALLING THIS

62
00:01:40,514 --> 00:01:41,014
OUT.

63
00:01:41,015 --> 00:01:42,315
WHEN A REPUBLICAN OR DEMOCRAT IS

64
00:01:42,316 --> 00:01:43,316
UNDER ATTACK -- FIRST OF ALL, WE

65
00:01:43,317 --> 00:01:45,118
DON'T EVEN KNOW WHO DID IT.

66
00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:46,619
WE SHOULD BE TRYING TO FIND OUT

67
00:01:46,620 --> 00:01:47,654
WHO DID IT BUT WE SHOULD BE

68
00:01:47,655 --> 00:01:48,488
CRITICIZING THE ACT WHETHER IT'S

69
00:01:48,489 --> 00:01:51,224
A REPUBLICAN OR DEMOCRAT.

70
00:01:51,225 --> 00:01:52,492
SOME PEOPLE ONLY CRITICIZE WHEN

71
00:01:52,493 --> 00:01:53,493
IT'S A DEMOCRAT UNDER ATTACK.

72
00:01:53,494 --> 00:01:55,595
AND THE MEDIA, BY THE WAY, WAS

73
00:01:55,596 --> 00:01:56,262
UNDER ATTACK AND THERE'S NO

74
00:01:56,263 --> 00:01:59,599
PLACE FOR THAT EITHER.

75
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:01,434
>> Tucker: HOW DO WE

76
00:02:01,435 --> 00:02:02,001
DE-ESCALATE THIS?

77
00:02:02,002 --> 00:02:02,836
THINGS SEEM TO BE MOVING IN A

78
00:02:02,837 --> 00:02:04,838
DIRECTION THAT'S OMINOUS AND SO

79
00:02:04,839 --> 00:02:08,308
WHAT OUR LEADERS NEED TO DO TO

80
00:02:08,309 --> 00:02:13,146
PULL US BACK TO >> I THINK THE

81
00:02:13,147 --> 00:02:14,280
MOST IMPORTANT THING IS TO GET

82
00:02:14,281 --> 00:02:16,416
BACK TO WHAT MADE THIS COUNTRY

83
00:02:16,417 --> 00:02:16,716
GREAT.

84
00:02:16,717 --> 00:02:17,817
OUR FOUNDERS DIDN'T SET UP SOME

85
00:02:17,818 --> 00:02:18,785
KIND OF SYSTEM WHERE EVERYBODY

86
00:02:18,786 --> 00:02:20,987
HAD TO THINK THE SAME WAY.

87
00:02:20,988 --> 00:02:22,622
IN FACT, THEY CHALLENGED THEIR

88
00:02:22,623 --> 00:02:23,857
GOVERNMENT AND THEY WANTED A

89
00:02:23,858 --> 00:02:25,925
SYSTEM WHERE INDIVIDUAL PEOPLE

90
00:02:25,926 --> 00:02:26,759
CAN SPEAK THEIR VIEWS AND EVEN

91
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:28,528
SPEAK OUT AGAINST THEIR

92
00:02:28,529 --> 00:02:30,497
GOVERNMENT AND THEY PUT THE

93
00:02:30,498 --> 00:02:31,264
FIRST AMENDMENT ULTIMATELY IN

94
00:02:31,265 --> 00:02:32,732
THE CONSTITUTION TO ENSURE THAT

95
00:02:32,733 --> 00:02:36,002
RIGHT BUT THE DIFFERENCE IS WE

96
00:02:36,003 --> 00:02:37,203
ALL HAVE OUR DISAGREEMENTS.

97
00:02:37,204 --> 00:02:38,438
YOU SHOULD NEVER MAKE THOSE

98
00:02:38,439 --> 00:02:39,205
PERSONAL AND YOU SHOULD NEVER

99
00:02:39,206 --> 00:02:40,640
THINK THAT VIOLENCE IS A WAY TO

100
00:02:40,641 --> 00:02:43,610
SETTLE OUR POLITICAL DIFFERENCE

101
00:02:43,611 --> 00:02:44,010
DIFFERENCES.

102
00:02:44,011 --> 00:02:44,711
WE SETTLE THEM AT THE BALLOT

103
00:02:44,712 --> 00:02:44,978
BOX.

104
00:02:44,979 --> 00:02:46,279
WE HAVE AN ELECTION IN 13 DAYS,

105
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:48,414
THAT'S WHERE WE SETTLE OUR

106
00:02:48,415 --> 00:02:49,015
DIFFERENCES.

107
00:02:49,016 --> 00:02:51,017
VIOLENCE IS NEVER AN ANSWER TO

108
00:02:51,018 --> 00:02:51,551
SOMEBODY'S POLITICAL

109
00:02:51,552 --> 00:02:53,186
DISAGREEMENT WITH SOMEBODY ELSE.

110
00:02:53,187 --> 00:02:54,220
>> Tucker: IT'S A WISE AND

111
00:02:54,221 --> 00:02:55,288
INTERESTING POINT YOU MAKE.

112
00:02:55,289 --> 00:02:56,389
YOU ARE SANE PEOPLE FEEL LESS

113
00:02:56,390 --> 00:02:58,591
FREE TO EXPRESS THEIR OPINIONS

114
00:02:58,592 --> 00:02:59,792
NOW THAN THEY HAVE IN PREVIOUS

115
00:02:59,793 --> 00:03:01,294
GENERATIONS AND THAT PART OF THE

116
00:03:01,295 --> 00:03:06,266
REASON THINGS ARE SO VOLATILE?

117
00:03:06,267 --> 00:03:06,966
>> WHEN SOMEBODY TRIES TO USE

118
00:03:06,967 --> 00:03:08,935
THREATS OR INTIMIDATION IF LIKE

119
00:03:08,936 --> 00:03:11,204
THE SCHOOLYARD BULLY.

120
00:03:11,205 --> 00:03:12,105
IF THEY DON'T WANT TO CONFRONT

121
00:03:12,106 --> 00:03:14,574
THEIR OWN DEMONS THEY TRY TO

122
00:03:14,575 --> 00:03:16,676
THREATEN YOU AND SCARE YOU AWAY

123
00:03:16,677 --> 00:03:18,011
FROM JUST LIVING YOUR EVERYDAY

124
00:03:18,012 --> 00:03:18,745
LIFE AND THAT'S NOT WHO WE ARE

125
00:03:18,746 --> 00:03:20,179
AS AMERICANS.

126
00:03:20,180 --> 00:03:22,382
YOU SAW AFTER SEPTEMBER 11TH

127
00:03:22,383 --> 00:03:24,417
WHEN OUR VERY WAY OF LIFE WAS

128
00:03:24,418 --> 00:03:26,519
UNDER ATTACK BY PEOPLE WHO HAD A

129
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:27,820
TOTALLY DIFFERENT VIEWPOINT OF

130
00:03:27,821 --> 00:03:29,055
AMERICA AND WHAT IT STANDS FOR

131
00:03:29,056 --> 00:03:30,056
AND WE CAME TOGETHER AS A

132
00:03:30,057 --> 00:03:31,057
COUNTRY AND WE SAID WE ARE NOT

133
00:03:31,058 --> 00:03:31,925
GOING TO BACK DOWN, WE ARE NOT

134
00:03:31,926 --> 00:03:34,661
GOING TO CHANGE WHO WE ARE AND

135
00:03:34,662 --> 00:03:35,995
WE SHOULDN'T DO IT HERE EITHER

136
00:03:35,996 --> 00:03:37,430
BUT WE SHOULD BE EQUALLY

137
00:03:37,431 --> 00:03:37,830
VIGILANT.

138
00:03:37,831 --> 00:03:39,232
REPUBLICAN AND DEMOCRAT, NO

139
00:03:39,233 --> 00:03:41,034
MATTER WHO WAS UNDER ATTACK,

140
00:03:41,035 --> 00:03:41,768
THAT IT'S WRONG FOR WHOEVER DID

141
00:03:41,769 --> 00:03:42,335
THE ATTACK.

142
00:03:42,336 --> 00:03:43,770
IT LETS FIND OUT THE DETAILS,

143
00:03:43,771 --> 00:03:45,104
DON'T TRY TO DEFLECT BLAME TRY

144
00:03:45,105 --> 00:03:48,074
TO BLAME SOMEBODY ELSE WHO HAD

145
00:03:48,075 --> 00:03:49,409
NOTHING TO DO WITH IT.

146
00:03:49,410 --> 00:03:50,109
LET'S ACTUALLY GO AFTER THE

147
00:03:50,110 --> 00:03:50,577
PEOPLE WHO DID.

148
00:03:50,578 --> 00:03:52,412
THAT'S WHAT WE SHOULD DO AND

149
00:03:52,413 --> 00:03:55,448
COMING TOGETHER AS AMERICANS AND

150
00:03:55,449 --> 00:03:56,416
AGAIN, IT'S NOT ABOUT

151
00:03:56,417 --> 00:03:56,816
PHILOSOPHY.

152
00:03:56,817 --> 00:03:58,217
I'M A CONSERVATIVE, I HAVE

153
00:03:58,218 --> 00:03:59,185
LIBERAL FRIENDS.

154
00:03:59,186 --> 00:03:59,953
I DISAGREEMENTS WITH THEM BUT I

155
00:03:59,954 --> 00:04:01,521
DON'T MAKE IT PERSONAL AND NONE

156
00:04:01,522 --> 00:04:02,889
OF US SHOULD MAKE IT PERSONAL.

157
00:04:02,890 --> 00:04:03,623
WE SHOULD WANT TO FIND OUT WHO

158
00:04:03,624 --> 00:04:05,792
DID IT.

159
00:04:05,793 --> 00:04:06,392
GET THE FACTS.

160
00:04:06,393 --> 00:04:07,627
DON'T GO TRYING TO BRING PEOPLE

161
00:04:07,628 --> 00:04:08,561
THAT HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH

162
00:04:08,562 --> 00:04:08,861
THIS.

163
00:04:08,862 --> 00:04:10,396
LET'S ALL BE FOCUSED ON COMING

164
00:04:10,397 --> 00:04:11,831
TOGETHER IN FINDING OUT WHO DID

165
00:04:11,832 --> 00:00:00,000
IT AND BRINGING THEM TO JUSTICE.
