1
00:00:01,264 --> 00:00:03,032
WILL HE RECERTIFY THAT DEAL OR

2
00:00:03,032 --> 00:00:03,799
STEP THE UNITED STATES AWAY FROM

3
00:00:03,799 --> 00:00:04,066
IT?

4
00:00:04,066 --> 00:00:07,603
KEEP WATCHING.

5
00:00:07,603 --> 00:00:08,404
>> Jessica: FOX NEWS ALERT,

6
00:00:08,404 --> 00:00:10,206
VOTERS HEADING TO THE POLLS IN

7
00:00:10,206 --> 00:00:11,507
FOUR STATES THAT COULD TEST

8
00:00:11,507 --> 00:00:14,443
PRESIDENT TRUMP'S CLOUT WITH

9
00:00:14,443 --> 00:00:15,544
G.O.P. VOTERS PARTICULARLY IN

10
00:00:15,544 --> 00:00:15,978
WEST VIRGINIA.

11
00:00:15,978 --> 00:00:16,712
A PRESIDENTIAL EMERGING FELLOW

12
00:00:16,712 --> 00:00:19,682
REPUBLICANS TO VOTE AGAINST

13
00:00:19,682 --> 00:00:21,584
DON BLANKENSHIP WHO HAS BEEN TO

14
00:00:21,584 --> 00:00:21,917
PRISON.

15
00:00:21,917 --> 00:00:24,220
BLANKENSHIP SAYING HE IS

16
00:00:24,220 --> 00:00:24,887
TRUMPIER THEN TRUMP AND NOT

17
00:00:24,887 --> 00:00:29,058
BACKING DOWN.

18
00:00:29,058 --> 00:00:30,126
SO THERE ARE FOUR STATES WITH

19
00:00:30,126 --> 00:00:32,061
PRIMARIES TODAY.

20
00:00:32,061 --> 00:00:33,663
IT HAS FELT TO ME LIKE THIS IS

21
00:00:33,663 --> 00:00:34,697
THE ONLY ONE THAT'S GOING ON

22
00:00:34,697 --> 00:00:38,200
HERE IN WEST VIRGINIA.

23
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:41,871
AS OUR GUEST HERE, WHAT DO YOU

24
00:00:42,004 --> 00:00:43,706
IS THAT TRUMPIER THEN TRUMP

25
00:00:43,706 --> 00:00:44,307
HEADED TO MANSION LAND?

26
00:00:44,307 --> 00:00:46,809
>> Gianno: I THINK THE

27
00:00:46,809 --> 00:00:47,877
PRESIDENT HAS LEARNED A LESSON

28
00:00:47,877 --> 00:00:50,146
WHEN IT COMES TO ROY MOORE IN

29
00:00:50,146 --> 00:00:50,479
ALABAMA.

30
00:00:50,479 --> 00:00:52,248
I THINK JOE MANCHIN WHO IS

31
00:00:52,248 --> 00:00:53,049
CURRENTLY VISITING SENATOR THERE

32
00:00:53,049 --> 00:00:56,018
IS A VERY POPULAR AND I KNOW

33
00:00:56,018 --> 00:00:58,154
THAT THERE'S TWO SEATS BEING

34
00:00:58,154 --> 00:00:58,888
TARGETED BY REPUBLICANS IN AREAS

35
00:00:58,888 --> 00:01:02,024
THAT DEMOCRATS -- WHERE

36
00:01:02,024 --> 00:01:02,792
PRESIDENT TRUMP WIN AND DEMOCRAT

37
00:01:02,792 --> 00:01:03,225
AREAS.

38
00:01:03,225 --> 00:01:05,027
BY A LOT SO THIS IS A VERY

39
00:01:05,027 --> 00:01:05,494
IMPORTANT SEAT.

40
00:01:05,494 --> 00:01:06,862
AND JUST THE FACT THAT THIS IS A

41
00:01:06,862 --> 00:01:08,230
GREAT EXAMPLE AS TO WHAT WE CAN

42
00:01:08,230 --> 00:01:08,964
DO IN TERMS OF MOVING FORWARD

43
00:01:08,964 --> 00:01:12,201
WITH A STRATEGY, THIS

44
00:01:12,201 --> 00:01:12,935
IMPEACHMENT TALK THAT'S BEEN

45
00:01:12,935 --> 00:01:14,570
COMING UP ACROSS THE SPECTRUM IS

46
00:01:14,570 --> 00:01:16,405
SOMETHING THAT IS VERY SERIOUS.

47
00:01:16,405 --> 00:01:20,476
I SPOKE WITH A MEMBER OF THE

48
00:01:20,476 --> 00:01:21,110
HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES

49
00:01:21,110 --> 00:01:22,611
RECENTLY WHO SAID THAT IF WE

50
00:01:22,611 --> 00:01:23,312
DON'T GET THE SENATE, IF WE

51
00:01:23,312 --> 00:01:24,547
DON'T KEEP THE SENATE AND WE

52
00:01:24,547 --> 00:01:28,017
LOSE THE HOUSE, THERE CAN LEAD

53
00:01:28,017 --> 00:01:28,818
TO VERY SERIOUS IMPLICATIONS.

54
00:01:28,818 --> 00:01:30,453
SO THIS IS BEYOND JUST MOVING

55
00:01:30,453 --> 00:01:31,253
THE PRESIDENT'S AGENDA FORWARD.

56
00:01:31,253 --> 00:01:33,055
IF THIS CAN GO INTO THE

57
00:01:33,055 --> 00:01:34,423
IMPEACHMENT CONVERSATION IF WE

58
00:01:34,423 --> 00:01:35,591
DON'T PICK UP SEATS OR MAINTAIN

59
00:01:35,591 --> 00:01:37,560
CONTROL OF THE SENATE.

60
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:38,427
>> Harris: 'S IS A PLACE WHERE

61
00:01:38,427 --> 00:01:40,162
THE PRESIDENT SHOULD OR SHOULD

62
00:01:40,162 --> 00:01:40,830
NOT STEP IN?

63
00:01:40,830 --> 00:01:43,232
WHAT HE DID IS DRAW ATTENTION TO

64
00:01:43,232 --> 00:01:45,568
A RACE THAT NOW IS SPLIT AMONG

65
00:01:45,568 --> 00:01:47,403
THREE PEOPLE STATISTICALLY.

66
00:01:47,403 --> 00:01:49,805
I THINK DON BLANKENSHIP IS UP BY

67
00:01:49,805 --> 00:01:50,339
A COUPLE OF POINTS.

68
00:01:50,339 --> 00:01:51,006
>> Rachel: I DON'T THINK YOU

69
00:01:51,006 --> 00:01:51,474
SHOULD STEP IN.

70
00:01:51,474 --> 00:01:54,377
I DON'T.

71
00:01:54,377 --> 00:01:56,145
I KNOW YOU WORKED FOR

72
00:01:56,145 --> 00:01:57,847
GOVERNOR ROMNEY.

73
00:01:57,847 --> 00:01:59,448
WHEN HE RAN AGAINST OBAMA IN

74
00:01:59,448 --> 00:02:02,051
THAT SECOND TERM, HE FELT LIKE A

75
00:02:02,051 --> 00:02:02,651
PREOBAMA CANDIDATE IN A

76
00:02:02,651 --> 00:02:04,820
POST-OBAMA WORLD.

77
00:02:04,820 --> 00:02:06,155
AND WHEN I SAW THE DEBATE

78
00:02:06,155 --> 00:02:09,824
BETWEEN THE VIRGINIA CANDIDATE,

79
00:02:09,824 --> 00:02:10,925
I DIDN'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT ANY

80
00:02:10,925 --> 00:02:11,794
OF THEM BUT IT STRUCK ME THAT

81
00:02:11,794 --> 00:02:15,664
THE OTHER TWO CANDIDATES WERE

82
00:02:15,664 --> 00:02:19,602
PRETRUMP CANDIDATES AND THAT

83
00:02:19,602 --> 00:02:20,603
BLANKENSHIP WAS SO AUTHENTIC.

84
00:02:20,603 --> 00:02:23,005
I REMEMBER THEY ASKED ALL THREE

85
00:02:23,005 --> 00:02:23,606
OF THEM REALLY DIFFICULT

86
00:02:23,606 --> 00:02:25,074
QUESTIONS AND THE TWO OTHER

87
00:02:25,074 --> 00:02:26,842
CANDIDATES DID THIS SORT OF

88
00:02:26,842 --> 00:02:28,010
POLITICIAN TALKING POINT WHERE

89
00:02:28,010 --> 00:02:29,879
THEY AVOIDED THE DIFFICULT

90
00:02:29,879 --> 00:02:30,646
QUESTION, DIDN'T ANSWER DIRECTLY

91
00:02:30,646 --> 00:02:32,782
IN THE OTHER GUY WHO HAD REALLY

92
00:02:32,782 --> 00:02:35,918
THE WORST WITH PRISON AND PEOPLE

93
00:02:35,918 --> 00:00:00,000
WHO DIED IN HIS CHARGE, HE
