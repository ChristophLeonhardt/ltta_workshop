it came as a great surprise to me that
this photo of a normal
I'm sorry naked bottom the whole of
Instagram is packed with photos just
like it I can't understand why it has
triggered such a response the hockey
club posted it because they admired my
foot bottom the idea was as simple as
that
so what we serve finances for that the
very concept of sexism is not
appropriate here spot I've hired me to
add a little bit of sexuality to their
predominantly male team the exploitation
of my sexuality is approved by me people
who like themselves often face a public
backlash but what's the point of staying
fit good-looking and spending the most
part of my life in the gym if I can't
display it no that won't change
you
