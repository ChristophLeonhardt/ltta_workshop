there's never been like that in modern
Russia it is huge in scope hundreds of
thousands of troops thousands of
aircraft entire fleets multiple
countries
for stock which means East in Russian
will test hundreds of divisions
regiments fleets a system-wide
stress test basically if there are
weaknesses cracks or laziness and the
Russian military they'll find out
Hieu outraged how dare Russia do this
they must be preparing for a new world
war or to invade NATO or to invade NATO
in the new world war the usual
fear-mongering
which is notably absent when others
carry out military exercises and despite
NATO observers being invited to attend
maneuvers are not directed against other
countries and are consistent with our
military doctrine which is defensive
hysterics aside this promises to be a
spectacle to remember and will be there
in Russia's Far East with the latest and
the greatest from Vostok 2018
