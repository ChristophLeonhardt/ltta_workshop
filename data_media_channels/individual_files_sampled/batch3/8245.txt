THIS IS "SPECIAL REPORT." ♪ ♪ Mike: GEECHINGS, WELCOME TO WASHINGTON. I'M MIKE EMANUEL IN FOR BRET BAIER. STRIVE TO BE WORTHY OF THE SACK FILES OF THE COUNTRY'S FALLEN MILITARY HEROES. ON THIS MEMORIAL DAY THE PRESIDENT AND HIS TEAM ARE ACTIVELY ENGAGED IN TRYING TO REDUCE THE CHANCE IN WAR IN WHAT COULD BE THE WORLD'S MOST DANGEROUS NEIGHBORHOOD. WE HAVE A REPORT FROM THE KOREAN PENINSULA IN THE MOMENT. KEVIN CORKE IS AT THE WHITE HOUSE. GOOD EVENING, KEVIN. GOOD EVENING, MIKE. SOLEMN DAY FOR THE PRESIDENT. SPEECHES, SONGS AND OF COURSE HEART FELT SALUTES FOR THE FOLKS WHO PAID THE ULTIMATE PRICE FOR OUR COUNTRY IN DEFENDING OUR FREEDOM. ALSO A DAY FULL OF NEW QUESTIONS ABOUT A BREWING SPY SCANDAL THAT THREATENS TO OVERRUN THE DOJ AND FBI. WE ARE GATHERED HERE ON THE SACRED SOIL OF ARLINGTON NATIONAL CEMETERY TO HONOR THE LIVES AND DEEDS OF AMERICA'S GREATEST HEROES. THE MEN AND WOMEN WHO LAID DOWN THEIR LIVES FOR OUR FREEDOM. ♪ OH SAY DOES THAT. IN MARKING THE SECOND MEMORIAL DAY OF HIS PRESIDENCY, PRESIDENT TRUMP TODAY CALLED ON ALL AMERICANS TO NEVER FORGET THE SACRIFICE OF FALLEN U.S. SERVICE MEMBERS. SAYING THEY SHARED A LOVE MORE DEEP AND MORE PURE THAN MOST WILL EVER KNOW. AMONG THE MANY VETERANS IN THE AUDIENCE TODAY, 94-YEAR-OLD BOB DOLE. FORMER KANSAS SENATOR WHO SPENT NEARLY FOUR DECADES IN CONGRESS AND WOUNDED IN COMBAT IN WORLD WAR II. HE RECEIVED A THUNDER RUSS OVATION GATHERING. WHILE THE PRESIDENT SPENT THIS MEMORIAL DAY HONORING THE MEMORIES OF THE FALLEN ON HALLOWED GROUND AND ONLINE HE BEGAN BY FOCUSING HIS ATTENTION TO A DISCUSSION ON FOX NEWS ON SO-CALLED SPY GATE IDEAS THAT THE FBI PLACED INFORMANT INTO AND AROUND THE CAMPAIGN DURING AND AFTER THE 2016 ELECTION. ON TWITTER PRESIDENT TRUMP JONATHAN TURLEY WHO TOLD FOX THAT THE PRESIDENT DESERVES SOME ANSWERS. SAID OF OUSTING AG SALLY YATES I FIND HER ACTIONS TO BE REALLY QUITE UNBELIEVABLE. AND SAID IF THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION PUT THE OPPOSING CAMPAIGN'S PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE OR HIS CAMPAIGN UNDER INVESTIGATION, THAT RAISES LEGITIMATE QUESTIONS, ADDING IT GOES TO THE HEART OF OUR ELECTORAL SYSTEM. WE SHOULD GET EVERYONE INVOLVED IN. GET THEM ON THE RECORD AND GET THAT RECORD TO THE PUBLIC. AT SOME POINT WE HAVE TO COME BACK TOGETHER AS A COUNTRY. THIS DIVISION IS GETTING DEEPER. IT'S BECAUSE POLITICIANS ON BOTH SIDES ARE PLAYING GAMES WITH THESE INVESTIGATIONS. WHILE NEW YORK DEMOCRATIC SENATOR CHUCK SCHUMER NOTED IN A TWEET THE MUELLER INVESTIGATION'S 19 INDICTMENTS AND THREE GUILTY PLEAS, HE FAILED TO MENTION THAT THERE HAS BEEN NO EVIDENCE OF RUSSIAN COLLUSION UNCOVERED BY THE SPECIAL COUNSEL WHO MAY NOT, IF THE PRESIDENT'S LAWYERS HAVE THEIR WAY, GET AN OPPORTUNITY TO INTERVIEW THE PRESIDENT IN THE RUSSIA PROBE. THE REALITY IS, WE'RE NOT GOING TO SIT THEM DOWN IF THIS IS A TRAP FOR PERJURY. AND UNTIL WE'RE CONVINCED OF THAT AND IF THEY DON'T SHOW US THESE DOCUMENTS, WE ARE JUST GOING TO HAVE TO SAY NO. GIULIANI SAYS THE PRESIDENT INSISTS HE WANTS TO SIT DOWN WITH THE SPECIAL COUNSEL. IN FACT, HE SAID AS MUCH ON THE RECORD, MIKE. IT'S ALSO IMPORTANT TO POINT OUT THAT HIS LAWYERS, AT LEAST FOR NOW, ARE ADVISING AGAINST IT.
