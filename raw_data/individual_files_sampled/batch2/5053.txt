50:52 I would have had you don't hear that every day as we said earlier shouts of shame while Democrat Joe Manchin was explaining his decision to vote for judge Kavanaugh met by those protesters in the hallway outside his office the outrage spilled into the streets we imagine it will this weekend as well it'll know about no doubt rather be a driving force in this election and the next as the cook Political Report put it today what we don't know is where all the energy that we are seeing on the right and the left goes once the nomination fight is over and then in a day that was already filled with its own remarkable moments we wanted to bring you this from Republican Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley do you have the sense now that you want to see a woman on the committee for on the Republican side we can i mean don't forget compared to a lot of committee meetings we have we have an executive every thursday and so it's a lot of work maybe they don't want to do it as they say that happened today and with us tonight Mara gay a member of the New York Times editorial board Josh Gerstein White House reporter for Politico we are happy to say that both our MSNBC contributors so morrow we have that and we have the sum total of today you this week wrote a a poignant personal piece in the opinion section of the New York Times about your life experience what do we do about the entire community of American women who look at a dr. Ford look at Amara gay and say yes you that story that's me you know it's a really first of all it's a sad day should be a sad day for all Americans but it's very difficult for those of us who are sexual assault survivors I think there's a time to grieve but I think there's a real risk here that people become so despairing that they don't participate and they feel as though their vote doesn't count and they don't show up to the polls and so you know my immediate thought was okay let's not despair well it's not lingering that lets actually organize and and channel that into you know wins at the the polling booth the other thing I would say is that I've been thinking a lot about my dad and his experience you know my father is black my mother is white but my dad grew up in segregated Detroit and been in segregated South Carolina he drank from a from a black only water fountain and so I think if when you compare the experience of black Americans to what's going on today with the me2 movement you really think about it as a long-term game and really that's kind of where we are right now I mean I think there's a lot of frustration about it's been a year since the me2 movement started what do we have to show for it today was a huge blow but there are seeds being sown every time a woman tells her story or in some cases a man and I think you know we need to kind of keep that perspective of you know you live to fight another day this is a long battle so just I think thinking about endurance is important here and just settling in for a long fight thank you for that Josh did you find any profiles encouraged today on Capitol Hill was it harder for a hike camp to vote no was it harder for a mansion to vote yes that kind of thing I think Brian the Heitkamp vote is one that that could cost her although she seems to be down a little bit in the polls so she may be in some trouble already I think Claire McCaskill is another person in Missouri who could suffer for her vote here but I do wonder if at least in the short to medium term maybe we're making a little too much of this I mean it is a generational potential shift in the court even without the Blasi Ford allegations that came up we're talking about a potentially a tectonics shiftin in the court that could affect it for one or two generations but I wonder if maybe is not even measured in election cycles but in news cycles there's so much noise so much cacophony that comes from this White House that within a within a matter of a couple of weeks this issue might be overtaken in the in the public mind by the president's latest insult directed at somebody on the campaign trail or some other controversy about an insider turning on the president it's really hard to measure and these things always seem searing and kind of apocalyptic in the moment mara speaking of generational and tectonic changes do you think the optics of the Republicans on the Judiciary Committee might change in the next Congress to quote chairman Grassley I'm wondering if there will be women senators it's very hard work and will they be willing to step up and do the hard you know you really couldn't write better campaign literature for Democrats so let's see how the party is able to capitalize on that but this really does seem to bring out you know the Republicans inner caveman I'm not quite sure where they're going with this none of that's going to be helpful in November you know it does it does it does hinge on turnout at this point but I do think that we'll see a demographic shift in those who are in power and I think there are a lot of very angry women I was actually out just on the street yesterday in New York City and I in a wild in the wild yeah and I bumped into a group of you know very passionate protesters anti Cavanaugh protesters making their way from Times Square to Trump Tower and I've seen a lot of protests I was a reporter for a very long time opinion writer but boy I've seen a lot of protest and I haven't felt the anger as viscerally as I felt it yesterday and so if people are in the streets and in our experience I'm sure you feel family then they usually show up to the polls so I do expect that we're going to see more women in office Josh I'm sorry I have to limit you to a brief closing note but do you see any of that in the wild in the wilds of DC something organically starting up think of the explosion of the women's March after inauguration yeah I mean I think we do live in an era where reaction seems very very strong and very capable of delivering people to the polls that's been the lesson of the last few elections in fact of Donald Trump's election I think many people would see that as a force of reaction and so the question is whether that anger on that side of the equation among Democrats among women in particular is going to prove to be a more motivating force than the sort of unity that the Republicans took away from this fight which was a significant you know development on their side but maybe not one that's as big as having that anger that gets you to the polls on Election Day hey there I'm Chris Hayes from MSNBC thanks for
