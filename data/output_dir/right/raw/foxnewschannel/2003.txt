1
00:00:01,330 --> 00:00:03,266
THE U.S. HAS BEEN IN

2
00:00:03,266 --> 00:00:03,933
CONSULTATION WITH ITS ALLIES

3
00:00:03,933 --> 00:00:05,234
ABOUT A NEW DEAL IN THOSE

4
00:00:05,234 --> 00:00:05,868
CONSULTATIONS WILL RESUME

5
00:00:05,868 --> 00:00:08,037
TOMORROW MORNING.

6
00:00:08,037 --> 00:00:09,238
>> Shepard: WE WILL BE BACK TO

7
00:00:09,238 --> 00:00:10,273
YOU IN A MOMENT.

8
00:00:10,273 --> 00:00:15,445
AT FIRST, JOHN ALTERMAN AT THE

9
00:00:15,445 --> 00:00:16,446
STRATEGIC AND INTERNATIONAL

10
00:00:16,446 --> 00:00:17,246
STUDIES NONPROFIT ORGANIZATION.

11
00:00:17,246 --> 00:00:18,948
HE ALSO STARRED IN THE STATE

12
00:00:18,948 --> 00:00:19,415
DEPARTMENT UNDER

13
00:00:19,415 --> 00:00:25,455
PRESIDENT GEORGE FW HW BUSH.

14
00:00:25,455 --> 00:00:26,656
FIRST OF ALL, YOUR INITIAL

15
00:00:26,656 --> 00:00:31,928
ACTION TO WHAT HAPPENED >> >>

16
00:00:31,928 --> 00:00:34,497
-- A REACTION TO WHAT HAPPENED?

17
00:00:34,497 --> 00:00:38,501
>> FIRST OF ALL, HE SAID WE ARE

18
00:00:38,634 --> 00:00:40,837
CLEARLY.

19
00:00:40,837 --> 00:00:43,506
THE DEAL DOESN'T HAVE A WAY TO

20
00:00:43,506 --> 00:00:43,873
WITHDRAW.

21
00:00:43,873 --> 00:00:45,475
AND I HAD TO GO TO THE TREASURY

22
00:00:45,475 --> 00:00:46,409
DEPARTMENT WEBSITE TO UNDERSTAND

23
00:00:46,409 --> 00:00:47,944
WHAT JOHN ROBERTS JUST

24
00:00:47,944 --> 00:00:49,045
EXPLAINED, THERE IS A 90 DAY

25
00:00:49,045 --> 00:00:51,280
WINDOW AND I 180 DAY WINDOW.

26
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:52,281
I THOUGHT THE PRESIDENT WOULD BE

27
00:00:52,281 --> 00:00:54,050
MORE IN THE WEEDS ON WHAT HE WAS

28
00:00:54,050 --> 00:00:57,653
DOING, HE JUST SAID, WE ARE DONE

29
00:00:57,653 --> 00:00:58,121
WITH THIS DEAL.

30
00:00:58,121 --> 00:00:59,122
>> Shepard: IT WHEN YOU SAID

31
00:00:59,122 --> 00:01:00,857
IT, YOU ARE DONE WITH IT, DID

32
00:01:00,857 --> 00:01:02,925
THIS DEAL OFFER A WAY TO PULL

33
00:01:02,925 --> 00:01:04,060
OUT OF ITSELF, OR ARE WE JUST

34
00:01:04,060 --> 00:01:06,662
SAYING THAT WE ARE GOING TO

35
00:01:06,662 --> 00:01:07,463
VIOLATE THE DEAL?

36
00:01:07,463 --> 00:01:08,831
THE RULES ON US FOR THE

37
00:01:08,831 --> 00:01:10,366
FOLLOWING, AND NOW WE ARE

38
00:01:10,366 --> 00:01:13,236
CHANGING THEM?

39
00:01:13,236 --> 00:01:15,238
SPEAK TO THE DEAL DIDN'T HAVE A

40
00:01:15,238 --> 00:01:15,872
PROVISION FOR WITHDRAWAL.

41
00:01:15,872 --> 00:01:17,940
WE ARE ESSENTIALLY SAYING WE ARE

42
00:01:17,940 --> 00:01:18,641
WILLFULLY WITHDRAWING.

43
00:01:18,641 --> 00:01:21,711
THE DEAL DOES HAVE A WAY FOR THE

44
00:01:21,711 --> 00:01:22,712
IRANIANS TO COMPLAIN THAT WE ARE

45
00:01:22,712 --> 00:01:23,846
NOT COMPLYING, WHETHER THEY GO

46
00:01:23,846 --> 00:01:26,048
THAT WAY OR NOT, I DON'T KNOW.

47
00:01:26,048 --> 00:01:27,450
IT SEEMS THAT OUR EUROPEAN

48
00:01:27,450 --> 00:01:28,351
ALLIES HAVE A LOT OF HARD

49
00:01:28,351 --> 00:01:30,453
DECISIONS TO MAKE ABOUT HOW THEY

50
00:01:30,453 --> 00:01:32,088
ARE TREATING THE UNITED STATES.

51
00:01:32,088 --> 00:01:33,022
I THINK COUNTRIES LIKE CHINA AND

52
00:01:33,022 --> 00:01:34,457
RUSSIA WERE PARTIES TO THE DEAL

53
00:01:34,457 --> 00:01:37,460
BUT HAVE THEIR OWN DEAL WITH THE

54
00:01:37,460 --> 00:01:38,828
UNITED STATES SEE SOME

55
00:01:38,828 --> 00:01:39,262
OPPORTUNITIES.

56
00:01:39,262 --> 00:01:40,997
I THINK FRANKLY, IRAN MAY SEE

57
00:01:40,997 --> 00:01:42,665
SOME OPPORTUNITIES TO TRY TO

58
00:01:42,665 --> 00:01:43,432
SPLIT THE UNITED STATES FROM ITS

59
00:01:43,432 --> 00:01:46,235
ALLIES IN MANY WAYS WHICH MAY BE

60
00:01:46,235 --> 00:01:47,837
THEIR FIRST BEST COURSE GOING

61
00:01:47,837 --> 00:01:48,171
FORWARD.

62
00:01:48,171 --> 00:01:49,272
>> Shepard: IT LOOKS LIKE THE

63
00:01:49,272 --> 00:01:51,641
PRESIDENT HAS JUST ANNOUNCED

64
00:01:51,641 --> 00:01:53,442
THAT HE WILL NEGOTIATE -- HE HAS

65
00:01:53,442 --> 00:01:54,177
ORDERED HIS FOREIGN LEADERS TO

66
00:01:54,177 --> 00:01:56,512
NEGOTIATE WITH OTHER PARTIES TO

67
00:01:56,512 --> 00:01:59,515
THIS DEAL.

68
00:01:59,515 --> 00:02:01,551
THEN HE SAID SOMEWHAT

69
00:02:01,551 --> 00:02:04,854
THREATENINGLY, IF NEGOTIATIONS

70
00:02:04,854 --> 00:02:07,456
FAIL, THE ISLAMIC REPUBLIC WILL

71
00:02:07,456 --> 00:02:10,993
ENRICH >> URANIUM MORE THAN

72
00:02:10,993 --> 00:02:11,360
BEFORE...

73
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:12,862
IN NEXT WEEKS.

74
00:02:12,862 --> 00:02:15,965
OUR >> WHAT ARE WE TO MAKE OF

75
00:02:15,965 --> 00:02:16,265
THAT?

76
00:02:16,265 --> 00:02:17,466
>> John: I THINK THE IRANIANS

77
00:02:17,466 --> 00:02:18,467
ARE TRYING TO SHOW THAT THEY

78
00:02:18,467 --> 00:02:19,936
HAVE A STRONG HAND, THEY ARE NOT

79
00:02:19,936 --> 00:02:23,072
WEAK AND THEY ARE NOT SCARED.

80
00:02:23,072 --> 00:02:24,307
THEIR ECONOMY, FRANKLY, WITH ALL

81
00:02:24,307 --> 00:02:26,409
OF THEIR OIL IS ABOUT THE STATE

82
00:02:26,409 --> 00:02:28,477
OF SIZE OF THE STATE OF

83
00:02:28,477 --> 00:02:29,278
MARYLAND.

84
00:02:29,278 --> 00:02:29,979
IT'S NOT A GLOBAL SUPER POWER

85
00:02:29,979 --> 00:02:32,315
HOUR AND THEY ARE COMING UP

86
00:02:32,315 --> 00:02:34,851
AGAINST MUCH STRONGER COUNTRIES.

87
00:02:34,851 --> 00:02:37,019
AGAIN, I THINK THE PRESIDENT HAS

88
00:02:37,019 --> 00:02:42,291
A HARD TASK AHEAD OF HIM, AND

89
00:02:42,291 --> 00:02:44,627
THE U.S. JUST WITHDREW THE

90
00:02:44,627 --> 00:02:47,063
SANCTIONS THAT APPLIED TO OTHER

91
00:02:47,063 --> 00:02:48,064
COUNTRIES, SECONDARY SANCTIONS.

92
00:02:48,064 --> 00:02:49,866
IT'S STILL ILLEGAL FOR AMERICANS

93
00:02:49,866 --> 00:02:51,534
TO DO BUSINESS WITH IRAN,

94
00:02:51,534 --> 00:02:52,835
WHETHER OTHER COUNTRIES WILL GO

95
00:02:52,835 --> 00:02:54,604
ALONG WITH THE REPOSSESSION OF

96
00:02:54,604 --> 00:02:57,006
AMERICAN SAINT >> SANCTIONS,

97
00:02:57,006 --> 00:02:57,840
UNDER THIS CONTEXT WHEN THE

98
00:02:57,840 --> 00:02:59,242
PRESIDENT JUST SAID WE COULD

99
00:02:59,242 --> 00:03:01,077
HAVE HAD A BETTER DEAL, I THINK

100
00:03:01,077 --> 00:03:03,112
REMAINS TO BE SEEN HOW THE

101
00:03:03,112 --> 00:03:05,414
FRENCH DECIDE TO PLAY THIS, THE

102
00:03:05,414 --> 00:03:06,716
BRITISH AND THE GERMANS, LET

103
00:03:06,716 --> 00:03:07,516
ALONE THE CHINESE AND THE

104
00:03:07,516 --> 00:03:07,917
RUSSIANS.

105
00:03:07,917 --> 00:03:09,252
I THINK WILL BE A VERY

106
00:03:09,252 --> 00:03:11,087
INTERESTING SEVERAL MONTHS AHEAD

107
00:03:11,087 --> 00:03:12,622
WHEN IT COMES TO IRAN POLICY.

108
00:03:12,622 --> 00:03:14,657
>> Shepard: I'M OUT OF TIME,

109
00:03:14,657 --> 00:03:17,360
BUT BEFORE WE GO, INTERNALLY IN

110
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:25,868
IRAN, THE HARD LEADER OF THAT

111
00:03:25,868 --> 00:03:27,370
ISLAMIC STATE, THERE HAS BEEN

112
00:03:27,370 --> 00:03:28,871
EXTREME PUSH AND PULL AND

113
00:03:28,871 --> 00:03:30,106
FRICTION WITHIN THE COUNTRY ON

114
00:03:30,106 --> 00:03:33,175
WHO WILL HAVE CONTROL OF THIS

115
00:03:33,175 --> 00:03:34,410
GOVERNMENT.

116
00:03:34,410 --> 00:03:35,111
WHAT EFFECT DOES THIS HAVE ON

117
00:03:35,111 --> 00:03:40,116
THAT RELATIONSHIP AND THE MORE

118
00:03:40,116 --> 00:03:41,250
HARDLINERS.

119
00:03:41,250 --> 00:03:44,654
I WOULDN'T CALL HIM A MODERATE,

120
00:03:44,654 --> 00:03:48,124
I WOULD CALL HIM A PRAGMATIST.

121
00:03:48,124 --> 00:03:50,092
I THINK HE WAS ANGRY AT IRAN AND

122
00:03:50,092 --> 00:03:51,093
HELPED UNITE THE WORLD TO PUT

123
00:03:51,093 --> 00:03:52,428
THE SANCTIONS ON IRAN THAT

124
00:03:52,428 --> 00:03:56,065
BROUGHT THEM TO THE JCPOA.

125
00:03:56,065 --> 00:03:59,335
>> Shepard: BUT IT INTERNALLY,

126
00:03:59,335 --> 00:04:04,874
WHAT DID HE    THAT GET HIM?

127
00:04:04,874 --> 00:04:06,909
WHAT DOES THIS DO TO THE MAN WE

128
00:04:06,909 --> 00:04:08,244
WERE NEGOTIATING WITH INSIDE OF

129
00:04:08,244 --> 00:04:10,379
IRAN AND HOW DOES THAT AFFECT

130
00:04:10,379 --> 00:04:11,480
THE WORLD STAGE?

131
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:12,581
SPEAK TO I DON'T THINK HE WAS

132
00:04:12,581 --> 00:04:16,351
EVER OUR FRIEND, I THINK HE WAS

133
00:04:16,351 --> 00:04:17,753
A PRAGMATIST, WHETHER HE WANTS

134
00:04:17,753 --> 00:04:19,454
TO BE A PRAGMATIST WHO WANTS TO

135
00:04:19,454 --> 00:04:20,389
RAISE TENSIONS, I DON'T THINK HE

136
00:04:20,389 --> 00:00:00,000
IS A MODERATE
