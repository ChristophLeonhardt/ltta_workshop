17
00:00:28,980 --> 00:00:30,750

18
00:00:30,750 --> 00:00:31,980
as a minor Granger because I want to

19
00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:33,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">talk to you about my</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> favorite books and</font>

20
00:00:33,660 --> 00:00:34,649
because I want to tell you about this

21
00:00:34,649 --> 00:00:36,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">really cool campaign that saved the</font>

22
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,579
children UK doing called read on get on

23
00:00:38,579 --> 00:00:39,899
anyway so I know this is true for

24
00:00:39,899 --> 00:00:41,520
probably quite a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of you but Hermione</font>

25
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:43,260
Granger was such an important character

26
00:00:43,260 --> 00:00:45,899
to me<font color="#E5E5E5"> growing up my red hair upon the</font>

27
00:00:45,899 --> 00:00:47,390
Philosopher's Stone when I was<font color="#E5E5E5"> six and</font>

28
00:00:47,390 --> 00:00:50,039
already<font color="#E5E5E5"> by the age I was what you would</font>

29
00:00:50,039 --> 00:00:51,809
call and no at all<font color="#E5E5E5"> and i'm still a bit</font>

30
00:00:51,809 --> 00:00:54,239
like that and I yeah I fall<font color="#E5E5E5"> into that</font>

31
00:00:54,239 --> 00:00:56,070
character quite often but never quite as

32
00:00:56,070 --> 00:00:57,960
intensely as when i was in school and

33
00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:00,149
going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> school and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> felt sometimes</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> very</font>

34
00:01:00,149 --> 00:01:03,030
visible for being the person who knew

35
00:01:03,030 --> 00:01:05,188
the answer wanted to know the<font color="#E5E5E5"> answer or</font>

36
00:01:05,188 --> 00:01:06,869
who was interested in doing the reading

37
00:01:06,869 --> 00:01:08,580
on all<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> stuff you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> become a bit</font>

38
00:01:08,580 --> 00:01:10,320
snooty in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> wigs this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is like a self</font>

39
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:13,049
protection mechanism and I hadn't really

40
00:01:13,049 --> 00:01:15,000
seen<font color="#CCCCCC"> that in fiction and I hadn't really</font>

41
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,770
seen<font color="#CCCCCC"> that in anyone until I read her my</font>

42
00:01:16,770 --> 00:01:18,450
Granger<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then as I got older the</font>

43
00:01:18,450 --> 00:01:19,860
great thing to me was that I<font color="#E5E5E5"> was</font>

44
00:01:19,860 --> 00:01:21,180
watching all these television shows and

45
00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:22,560
all these films which would have<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

46
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:24,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">makeover point when all of a sudden the</font>

47
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:26,460
ugly duckling would become the beautiful

48
00:01:26,460 --> 00:01:28,049
swan and that just wasn't the case with

49
00:01:28,049 --> 00:01:30,240
her money<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mean she had that scene in</font>

50
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:32,159
the euro and the high water goblet of

51
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:34,049
fire and she'd spent hours and hours

52
00:01:34,049 --> 00:01:35,970
make it her sleek and getting it all

53
00:01:35,970 --> 00:01:37,619
ready and like just just putting

54
00:01:37,619 --> 00:01:39,030
everything together but for her it just

55
00:01:39,030 --> 00:01:40,409
wasn't really something she<font color="#E5E5E5"> wanted to</font>

56
00:01:40,409 --> 00:01:42,299
<font color="#E5E5E5">spend hours of her day doing so she</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font>

57
00:01:42,299 --> 00:01:43,500
went back<font color="#CCCCCC"> to like what she was</font>

58
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:44,700
comfortable in I thought<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> was really</font>

59
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:46,680
<font color="#CCCCCC">cool I had never seen that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> anywhere</font>

60
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:48,840
anywhere that bit was particularly

61
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:50,640
gratifying to me she's a logical thinker

62
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:52,470
she's very daring a lot of ways she

63
00:01:52,470 --> 00:01:54,060
thinks the<font color="#E5E5E5"> best of teachers she can</font>

64
00:01:54,060 --> 00:01:56,070
often be found in a library like yeah

65
00:01:56,070 --> 00:01:57,570
there were quite a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of similarities</font>

66
00:01:57,570 --> 00:01:59,610
there and she<font color="#E5E5E5"> was and continues to be my</font>

67
00:01:59,610 --> 00:02:01,590
hero so thank you JK Rowling for Miley

68
00:02:01,590 --> 00:02:03,630
grindr Save the Children's read on get

69
00:02:03,630 --> 00:02:05,610
on campaign is based on the new research

70
00:02:05,610 --> 00:02:08,098
<font color="#E5E5E5">that shows that one in four children who</font>

71
00:02:08,098 --> 00:02:09,660
are leaving school at the age of the lab

72
00:02:09,660 --> 00:02:11,730
so leaving primary school are unable<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

73
00:02:11,730 --> 00:02:13,860
read well and this figure increases

74
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:15,750
hugely when you look at the poorest

75
00:02:15,750 --> 00:02:17,280
children forty percent of those kids

76
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:19,260
leaving school are unable to<font color="#CCCCCC"> read well</font>

77
00:02:19,260 --> 00:02:21,030
so as of the beginning of this week save

78
00:02:21,030 --> 00:02:22,710
the children<font color="#CCCCCC"> have partnered with leaning</font>

79
00:02:22,710 --> 00:02:24,360
charities and teachers businesses

80
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:26,040
floggers to work towards the mission<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

81
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:29,970
<font color="#CCCCCC">that by 2025 every child at</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> age 11 will</font>

82
00:02:29,970 --> 00:02:31,890
be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to read well the born to read</font>

83
00:02:31,890 --> 00:02:33,360
program is getting ready to roll<font color="#E5E5E5"> out</font>

84
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:37,710
<font color="#CCCCCC">over</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> 7,000 helpers for 23,000 pupils and</font>

85
00:02:37,710 --> 00:02:39,180
they'll be sent to schools and deprived

86
00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:40,920
areas of the country but obviously for

87
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:42,390
this you need books and I<font color="#CCCCCC"> love these</font>

88
00:02:42,390 --> 00:02:43,830
schools don't have the resources for

89
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:46,680
those books so that's where you come in

90
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:49,230
so this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> task at hand five pounds</font>

91
00:02:49,230 --> 00:02:52,140
<font color="#CCCCCC">will buy a kid of book and 70 pounds</font>

92
00:02:52,140 --> 00:02:54,090
will buy a kid a box of books for a year

93
00:02:54,090 --> 00:02:56,250
so if<font color="#E5E5E5"> we all come together that we can</font>

94
00:02:56,250 --> 00:02:57,840
help them out and<font color="#E5E5E5"> provide them with the</font>

95
00:02:57,840 --> 00:02:59,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">resources they need to how about as many</font>

96
00:02:59,430 --> 00:03:01,080
kids as possible<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll put a link in the</font>

97
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:02,340
description bar where you can find out

98
00:03:02,340 --> 00:03:03,900
more<font color="#E5E5E5"> information about the campaign but</font>

99
00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:04,950
state the children ourselves something

100
00:03:04,950 --> 00:03:06,960
really cool if you text Harry as in

101
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:08,220
Harry Potter because I dressed up<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's</font>

102
00:03:08,220 --> 00:03:10,350
my knee and they set that<font color="#CCCCCC"> up</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just me if</font>

103
00:03:10,350 --> 00:03:13,110
you text Harry<font color="#E5E5E5"> 27 triple zero eight then</font>

104
00:03:13,110 --> 00:03:15,090
you will donate five pounds to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> cause</font>

105
00:03:15,090 --> 00:03:16,920
and it's just from<font color="#E5E5E5"> your phone and it</font>

106
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:18,180
<font color="#CCCCCC">will</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just be taking off your phone</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> bills</font>

107
00:03:18,180 --> 00:03:22,140
super easy donating Harry 27 00 08 but

108
00:03:22,140 --> 00:03:23,730
yes let's get these kids some books and

109
00:03:23,730 --> 00:03:25,410
