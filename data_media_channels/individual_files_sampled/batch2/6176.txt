RECENTLY WE GAVE YOU THE STORY OF A NURSE WHO WOULD NOT LET A POLICE OFFICER TAKE THE BLOOD OF SOMEONE WHO WAS UNCONSCIOUS AND IN HER CARE. THIS WAS A SALT LAKE CITY-BASED NURSE, ALEX WUBBELS, AND A POLICE OFFICER HAD COME IN AND DEMANDED TO GET A BLOOD SAMPLE FROM THE PERSON WHO WAS KNOCKOUT. LET ME GIVE YOU SOME CONTEXT THAT IS IMPORTANT SHE'S RIGHT BY LAW, AS WE WILL GET INTO IN A SECOND. HE DID NOT HAVE THE GUY'S CONSENT BECAUSE HE'S PASSED OUT, AND HE WAS NOT WANTED IN ANY KIND OF CRIME, THERE WAS NO WARRANT, NO NEED FOR A WARRANT, BECAUSE HE WAS A VICTIM. SO WHAT HAPPENED WAS THERE WAS A HIGH-SPEED CHASE, THE PERSON IN THE HOSPITAL WAS NOT INVOLVED IN THE HIGH-SPEED CHASE. THE GUY THE COPS WERE CHASING CRASHED INTO THE TRUCK DRIVER WHO IS IN THE HOSPITAL, THE GUY DOING THE HIGH-SPEED CHASE, DEAD. IT TURNS OUT THE COPS ARE NOT SUPPOSED TO DO THAT HIGH-SPEED CHASE, SO THEY MIGHT HAVE SOME RESPONSIBILITY. SO CONVENIENTLY, THEY SEND AN OFFICER DOWN TO GET THE BLOOD OF THE INNOCENT TRUCK DRIVER. GOD FORBID HE SMOKED MARIJUANA OR ANYTHING ELSE 40 DAYS AGO, THAT MIGHT SHOW UP IN HIS BLOOD, AND THEY GO, I MEAN, ARE THE COPS RESPONSIBLE? I DON'T KNOW, LOOK AT THE TRUCK DRIVER WHO APPEARED TO BE INNOCENT, BUT THERE'S SOMETHING IN HIS BLOOD. HE DIDN'T GIVE CONSENT TO THAT, YOU DON'T HAVE THE RIGHT TO ROB THE GUY OF HIS BLOOD OR HIS CONSENT OR ANYTHING ALONG THOSE LINES, SO THE NURSE STOOD UP FOR HER PATIENT EXACTLY LIKE SHE WAS SUPPOSED TO, AND NOW THE POLICE DEPARTMENT HAS ACTUALLY APOLOGIZED AND SAID THEIR ACTIONS WERE ABSOLUTELY UNACCOUNTABLE. I WANT TO SHOW YOU A SMALL SNIPPET FROM THAT VIDEO BEFORE I TELL YOU CONSERVATIVE REACTION TO THIS, WHICH IS IN SOME WAYS OF COURSE PRINTABLE, BUT GRUESOME AND RIDICULOUS ANYWAY. HERE IS WHAT HAPPENED AT THE TAIL END OF THAT CONFRONTATION. NO, WE'RE DONE. WE'RE DONE, YOU'RE UNDER ARREST. SOMEBODY HELP ME! STOP! YOU'RE ASSAULTING ME, STOP! STOP, I'VE DONE NOTHING WRONG! I'VE DONE NOTHING WRONG! THIS IS CRAZY! IT IS INDEED CRAZY, WE SHOULD HAVE DONE THIS, BUT WE DIDN'T, I SHOULD KNOW BETTER, BUT A VERY FINE POPEHAT WAS PRESCIENT ENOUGH TO WRITE THIS TWEET AT THE TIME MAN, HE NAILED IT. AND HERE COMES DAILY CALLER STEPPING UP TO THE PLATE, THEY HAVE A HOT TAKE ON IT WHAT KIND OF MONSTER WATCHES THAT VIDEO AND SAYS FINALLY, THE NURSE GOT WHAT IS COMING TO HER. TRYING TO STAND UP FOR HER PATIENT AND PROTECT THE LAW BY THE WAY, THE POLICE DEPARTMENT AGREED TO THE PROVISIONS SHE WAS TALKING ABOUT A YEAR AGO, THAT SAME POLICE DEPARTMENT AGREED TO THOSE TERMS. SO NO, SOMEHOW THE COPS ALWAYS HAVE TO BE RIGHT, NO MATTER WHAT GOES WRONG. GREGG RE, AT THE DAILY CALLER, WHO WROTE THIS PIECE, SAYS THAT ALREADY SHOWS THAT THEY ARE DEAD WRONG. THERE IS NO CONSERVATIVE IN AMERICA WHO IS RIGHT WHEN IT SAYS IT'S A CLOSE CASE. IF THEY ARE ANYWHERE NEAR RIGHT THEY SAY WE ARE TOTALLY RIGHT. THIS ONE IS CLOSE, CLOSER THAN IT APPEARS COME ON. LET'S GO TO THE SUBSTANCE HERE. HE SAYS PAYNE IS THE OFFICER THERE OKAY, IF THAT'S HOW YOU WANT TO ROLL. AND I'M SURE THAT THE VICIOUS PEOPLE WHO READ THE DAILY CALLER ARE LIKE, YEAH, WE MADE HER HOWL. GOOD JOB, COP, WAY TO DO THAT TO THAT POOR NURSE. SHE HAD IT COMING. I WONDER IF IT WAS A PREREQUISITE FOR GREGG RE WRITING THIS PIECE TO FOAM AT THE MOUTH WHILE TYPING. HE GOES ON TO SAY LOOK, EVERYONE KNOWS THAT THERE IS THIS EXCEPTION FOR EXIGENT CIRCUMSTANCES, THEN HE GOES ON TO PATRONIZE EVERYONE, WRITING ABOUT HOW IF SOMEONE RUNS INTO YOUR HOUSE WITH DRUGS, THE COPS CAN TEST HIM. IN THIS CASE, WE HAVE AN INNOCENT VICTIM WHO WAS RUN INTO AND HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH THE CRASH. IT IS NOT AN EXIGENT CIRCUMSTANCE, THEY AREN'T CHASING ANYONE DOWN, SO THE ANALOGY DOESN'T HOLD IT ALL. LET ME GO TO MEDIAITE, WHICH EXPLAINS SO ABSOLUTELY WRONG ON THE LAW, WRONG ON THE CONSTITUTION, WRONG IN EVERY WAY, BUT THAT'S NOT WHY THEY WROTE THE PIECE. THEY WROTE THE PIECE SO THEY CAN SAY COPS ARE ALWAYS RIGHT, AND IF YOU STAND IN THEIR WAY THEY WILL CRUSH YOU. YES! YOU ARE AN INNOCENT NURSE PROTECTING YOUR PATIENTS? YOU HAD IT COMING! THEY DON'T LIKE THAT BECAUSE THEIR AUDIENCE DOESN'T LIKE IT. YOU AND I LOOK AT THAT WITH DISGUST AND DISDAIN, MOST AMERICANS DO, BUT THE DAILY CALLER AUDIENCE THINKS YES, FINALLY SOMEONE STOOD UP TO THOSE NURSES AND MADE THEM PAY. THIS IS THE KIND OF VICIOUS, AND YES, DEPLORABLE, CONSERVATIVE BASE ONLINE THAT READS THIS CRAP.
