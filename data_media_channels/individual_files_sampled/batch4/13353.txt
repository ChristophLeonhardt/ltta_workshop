thank you for being here thanks for having me so you had the hardest job on planet Earth a White House press secretary spokesman for the president United States how would you rate your tenure at the White House you can be a letter grade numerical siskel and ebert thumbs up how do you think that you did looking back on it now I you know I I think that considering the nature of Trump's presidency that he was a disrupter that this is a guy he didn't come at this with a group of political loyalists that a lot of people have had in the past I think we did really well when you look at what we accomplished in the first six months and the groundwork that that laid to things like tax reform you know I think it really was a disruptive time but it also was a productive time absolutely I certainly agree with that can you take us behind the scenes a little bit I've always wondered about that job more than the chief of staff more than even the president what it is like in that pressure cooker for the press secretary what does a typical day look like it's a great question because I think there's a question of what does the job normally look like and what does it look like under a trump administration because and one of the things that I did is really speak to a lot of my predecessors and try to understand the battle rhythm of the day what happens the the process that they all understood that was vastly different under Trump because you know for the most part throughout my career and throughout the career of most press people you're advising the principal as far as what to say when to say it and you know even what platform to use with Trump he's pretty much the lead on a lot of those things and that's a very different dynamic and when he came to the briefing obviously the intensity in scrutiny during the Trump administration was vastly different than it has been under any previous administration and so the job in itself is very very different than then then it was in the past and part of the you know you mentioned the book earlier I I walked through a day-in-the-life what I used to be like to get ready every day and the only way to really you know the short end of it it was like getting ready for a final exam every day well you know I really look forward to reading it I I'd always try to read the book before the interview but I don't have a copy yet so I'm eagerly looking forward because it sounds really good and I agree obviously the Trump administration is just a different beast than these previous administrations I thought you handled yourself wonderfully I was a big cheerleader of Sean Spicer and Sean Spicer universe one I knew there was one out there yeah right you know it's funny yeah can I tell you a funny story that you you just brought that up I'm on I've been at an event for my son in the last hour so and I walked in and one of the other parents said gosh that tweet you put out about Trudeau was hysterical and I said are you being serious because you know that's not me right and they were like what do you mean that's like you're following a parody account that is a lot of people will see those tweets all the time and I think the reason the parody works so well is it because the account of Sean's spicier or the you know the the spicier version it actually does channel a lot of that spirit you brought to it I mean you I actually always I always felt you were I feel you were far kinder to those blood sucking leeches in the media then they deserved it all I thought you know you handled them very well do you have any regrets about them I found they would always try to gin up these fake gaffes about you like you know you were lost in the bushes or something or you made a completely accurate statement about the number of people who view the inauguration and they would pretend like you were saying these crazy things do you have regrets about that you wish you had I don't have been harder on them or something well there's a lot of interactions that that I've had you know whether it's personal or professional when I look back and say you know could I have been better at that and I think just because there you know it's it's a lot of the advice that I look back on with stuff that you know most of our moms teach us right two wrongs don't make a right just because they said it doesn't mean you do too and and and so there were times when I think I probably let them get a let them get the better of me once in a while or I we escalated too quickly but you're right I mean there were times when I looked at and I thought to myself wait a second the job of the press secretary is to speak on the after the president of the administration the American people and it was too often that I had to talk about myself and that's that's not a good place to be as a pressed person right well this gets to a real question because there seems to be this media crack up in the last few years in the old days the network's dominated Republicans had to play with these guys even though they were quite hostile now we have all of these other outlets we have twitter we have live-streaming you've been in Republican communications for a long time but you know people know you primarily as the press secretary you were communications director for the RNC House Budget Committee chief strategist to the RNC you've known them for a long time this question has two parts should Republicans still talk to outlets that are hostile to them the New York Times or should we tell these lefty mouthpieces to go pound sand and second are there any good journalists that you would still recommend these guys are doing hard work they're not just partisan hacks to great questions on the first one yes we should talk to them because you don't seed ground you don't grow the audience you don't allow people to hear conservative ideas if you ignore them I believe just like you know that if you look at what what the church does in terms of missionaries the idea is to go out there and to spread the good news and I think if you are a social and fiscal conservative then part of what you want to do is go out there and explain to people because what happens more than anything is a lot of these Main Street outlets either you know cover conservatives in a very nasty way or don't cover issues of importance and so by being out there it allows people who might be watching this oh hey I never thought of that issue in that way or I never knew that I shared the views of you know a particular person might be espousing them on a policy or what have you and so I think it's a great way to grow the movement and secondly yeah there are a lot of great reporters in that briefing room and you know the interesting thing is and I actually have a part in the book where I talk about this where there are some really good reporters at a lot of reputable outlets it's not it's not always just the broad brush the Washington Post the New York Times or whatever there are good reporters in a lot of these institutions and what I want to do is make sure that we call balls and strikes better call out the bad reporters and then we praise the good ones because when we just say fake news or the New York Times is horrible then we sort of dismiss the ones that are actually doing a decent job and I think what what has really killed things is two things one is social media where reporters almost acted as if people don't have Twitter accounts themselves because they express these opinions and things that really expose their liberal bias and second is the need for a lot of these reporters to get on television will make them say and do outrageous things to sort of get themselves bucked that makes perfect sense that that you know the the sensationalism of it obviously not every reporter is just Jim Acosta who I believe is played by Will Ferrell these days on television that you know there are there are people at these outlets who aren't just the editors there they're all are doing work and I agree I think it might be something about our Catholicism that we just are perfectly willing to talk to anybody go into the belly of the beast but I have taken too much of your time you've got to run you were you were with your family right now that's another thank you you know the funny thing is after reading your book I really felt inspired you know people ask me all the time why do I want to write a book and I just felt your book really laid out a lot of the policies but I think we're so key to the Democrats current state of being that I just needed to kind of put my thoughts to paper but I I think it was it was a lot more writing than and you probably did well perhaps although I did a lot of research and I will say Sean I always knew you were I always knew you were a gentleman but now I know that you're a scholar as well so I look forward to reading yours there were a couple at some point we have more time I want to debate a couple of the issues that you raised in there right around the 200 page mark I thought you got into some pretty meaty stuff it does it's an esoteric reading too so what will really have to go into the different layers that we have there but I suppose that'll be for a future episode John thank you so much for being here I really appreciate it and I'll talk to you next time you bet thank you
