00:00:20,154 --> 00:00:21,545
DIG THROUGH THE BIBLE TO FIND PASSAGES THAT LENT THEMSELVES TO

14
00:00:21,588 --> 00:00:23,213
PASSAGES THAT LENT THEMSELVES TO THE CURRENT BORDER PRACTICE OF

00:02:00,121 --> 00:02:01,980
THAT’S JUST A SMALL SAMPLING OF WHAT’S IN THE WIEBLBIBLE.

65
00:02:02,023 --> 00:02:03,714
WHAT’S IN THE WIEBLBIBLE. JOINING US NOW, JAMES MARTIN,

00:02:13,435 --> 00:02:15,126
JESUIT MAGAZINE. I DON’T DO A LOT OF VERSE.

69
00:02:15,136 --> 00:02:16,027
I DON’T DO A LOT OF VERSE. I’VE STUDIED VERSE.

70
00:02:16,070 --> 00:02:17,061
I’VE STUDIED VERSE. I DON’T DO THAT.

71
00:02:17,105 --> 00:02:18,496
I DON’T DO THAT. BUT ADMINISTRATION HAS FORCED

72
00:02:18,506 --> 00:02:19,530
BUT ADMINISTRATION HAS FORCED THIS DISCUSSION UPON US, BECAUSE

73
00:02:19,540 --> 00:02:21,632
THIS DISCUSSION UPON US, BECAUSE THEY HAVE SAID IT’S THE BIBLICAL

74
00:02:21,642 --> 00:02:22,500
THEY HAVE SAID IT’S THE BIBLICAL THING TO DO.

75
00:02:22,510 --> 00:02:24,202
THING TO DO. I DON’T THINK THERE IS A

76
00:02:24,212 --> 00:02:26,704
I DON’T THINK THERE IS A CHRISTIAN, A MUSLIM, OR A JEW IN

77
00:02:26,715 --> 00:02:28,940
CHRISTIAN, A MUSLIM, OR A JEW IN THIS COUNTRY WHO CAN FIND ME IN

THIS COUNTRY WHO CAN FIND ME IN THEIR HOLY BOOK REFERENCES THAT

79
00:02:32,620 --> 00:02:33,344
THEIR HOLY BOOK REFERENCES THAT SUGGEST THAT THAT IS

80
00:02:33,354 --> 00:02:33,744
SUGGEST THAT THAT IS APPROPRIATE.

81
00:02:33,755 --> 00:02:35,146
APPROPRIATE. >> I THINK YOU’RE RIGHT.

82
00:02:35,156 --> 00:02:36,748
>> I THINK YOU’RE RIGHT. I THINK WHAT THEY’RE DOING IS

83
00:02:36,758 --> 00:02:37,715
I THINK WHAT THEY’RE DOING IS CALLED PROOF TEXTING.

84
00:02:37,726 --> 00:02:39,450
CALLED PROOF TEXTING. YOU TAKE A VERSE OF THE GOSPELS

85
00:02:39,493 --> 00:02:41,652
YOU TAKE A VERSE OF THE GOSPELS OR THE OLD TESTAMENT OUT OF

86
00:02:41,663 --> 00:02:44,756
OR THE OLD TESTAMENT OUT OF CONTEXT AND THROW IT AT PEOPLE

87
00:02:44,766 --> 00:02:45,890
CONTEXT AND THROW IT AT PEOPLE WEAPONIZING THE BIBLE.

88
00:02:45,934 --> 00:02:47,458
WEAPONIZING THE BIBLE. THE ENTIRE BIBLE AND CERTAINLY

89
00:02:47,502 --> 00:02:49,360
THE ENTIRE BIBLE AND CERTAINLY IF WE’RE TALKING ABOUT A

90
00:02:49,370 --> 00:02:51,162
IF WE’RE TALKING ABOUT A CHRISTIAN POINT OF VIEW IS IN

91
00:02:51,172 --> 00:02:53,898
CHRISTIAN POINT OF VIEW IS IN FAVOR OF THE POOR AND THOSE

92
00:02:53,942 --> 00:02:54,966
FAVOR OF THE POOR AND THOSE STRUGGLING.

93
00:02:54,976 --> 00:02:57,168
STRUGGLING. AND IN FACT, JESUS’S TEST FOR

94
00:02:57,178 --> 00:02:59,471
AND IN FACT, JESUS’S TEST FOR WHETHER OR NOT YOU GET INTO HEF

95
00:02:59,514 --> 00:03:01,406
WHETHER OR NOT YOU GET INTO HEF SEASON HOW YOU TREATED POOR AND

96
00:03:01,449 --> 00:03:02,173
SEASON HOW YOU TREATED POOR AND STRUGGLING PEOPLE AND THE

97
00:03:02,216 --> 00:03:02,540
STRUGGLING PEOPLE AND THE STRANGER.

98
00:03:02,584 --> 00:03:03,241
STRANGER. IT’S CLEAR.

99
00:03:03,251 --> 00:03:06,444
IT’S CLEAR. AND THEIR USE OF IT IS

100
00:03:06,454 --> 00:03:06,844
AND THEIR USE OF IT IS DISGRACEFUL.

101
00:03:06,855 --> 00:03:11,650
DISGRACEFUL. >> I WOULD RATHER NOT HAVE THE

102
00:03:11,660 --> 00:03:13,985
>> I WOULD RATHER NOT HAVE THE CONVERSATION IN THAT CONTEXT.

103
00:03:14,029 --> 00:03:15,353
CONVERSATION IN THAT CONTEXT. WE HAVE OTHER GOOD POLITICAL

104
00:03:15,397 --> 00:03:16,554
WE HAVE OTHER GOOD POLITICAL CONTEXTS TO HAVE THEM.

105
00:03:16,565 --> 00:03:17,589
CONTEXTS TO HAVE THEM. INCLUDING THE FACT THAT THAT WE

106
00:03:17,632 --> 00:03:18,924
INCLUDING THE FACT THAT THAT WE SIGNED ONTO INTERNATIONAL

107
00:03:18,967 --> 00:03:19,891
SIGNED ONTO INTERNATIONAL AGREEMENTS ABOUT THE WAY WE

108
00:03:19,935 --> 00:03:22,527
AGREEMENTS ABOUT THE WAY WE TREAT REFUGEES, BUT YOU BRING UP

109
00:03:22,571 --> 00:03:23,295
TREAT REFUGEES, BUT YOU BRING UP AN IMPORTANT POINT.

110
00:03:23,338 --> 00:03:27,766
AN IMPORTANT POINT. IF YOU ARE GOING TO TAKE A HOLY

111
00:03:27,809 --> 00:03:30,201
IF YOU ARE GOING TO TAKE A HOLY BOOK AND WEAPON NEWSIZE IT, YOU

112
00:03:30,212 --> 00:03:31,103
BOOK AND WEAPON NEWSIZE IT, YOU TO HAVE THE OTHER SIDE OF THE

113
00:03:31,146 --> 00:03:31,470
TO HAVE THE OTHER SIDE OF THE ARGUMENT.

114
00:03:31,513 --> 00:03:33,505
ARGUMENT. I DO NOT ENJOY TAKING FIVE

115
00:03:33,548 --> 00:03:34,740
I DO NOT ENJOY TAKING FIVE VERSES OUT OF THE BIBLE AND

116
00:03:34,783 --> 00:03:36,408
VERSES OUT OF THE BIBLE AND QUOTING IT OUT OF CONTEXT.

117
00:03:36,451 --> 00:03:38,910
QUOTING IT OUT OF CONTEXT. IF PEOPLE READ THE BIBLE OR

118
00:03:38,921 --> 00:03:40,612
IF PEOPLE READ THE BIBLE OR KORAN, THEY SHOULD READ IT IN

119
00:03:40,622 --> 00:03:40,946
KORAN, THEY SHOULD READ IT IN CONTEXT.

120
00:03:40,989 --> 00:03:42,180
CONTEXT. >> WE SHOULD AVOID GETTING INTO

121
00:03:42,190 --> 00:03:43,515
>> WE SHOULD AVOID GETTING INTO BACK AND FORTH AS YOU’RE

122
00:03:43,525 --> 00:03:43,915
BACK AND FORTH AS YOU’RE SUGGESTING.

123
00:03:43,925 --> 00:03:45,884
SUGGESTING. THE OVERALL SPIRIT OF THE BIBLE,

124
00:03:45,894 --> 00:03:48,019
THE OVERALL SPIRIT OF THE BIBLE, RIGHT, IS CARING FOR THE POOR,

125
00:03:48,030 --> 00:03:50,622
RIGHT, IS CARING FOR THE POOR, AND BEING LOVING AND

AND BEING LOVING AND COMPASSIONATE AND MERCIFUL.

127
00:03:53,201 --> 00:03:55,126
COMPASSIONATE AND MERCIFUL. I CANNOT IMAGINE ANYONE THINKING

128
00:03:55,137 --> 00:03:57,229
I CANNOT IMAGINE ANYONE THINKING JESUS WOULD APPROVE OF RIPPING

129
00:03:57,239 --> 00:03:58,897
JESUS WOULD APPROVE OF RIPPING CHILDREN FROM THEIR PARENTS.

130
00:03:58,907 --> 00:04:00,699
CHILDREN FROM THEIR PARENTS. NOW, I MEAN, IT GOES AGAINST

131
00:04:00,709 --> 00:04:02,501
NOW, I MEAN, IT GOES AGAINST PRETTY MUCH THE ENTIRE BIBLE IN

132
00:04:02,511 --> 00:04:06,038
PRETTY MUCH THE ENTIRE BIBLE IN THE ETHOS OF JESUS, AND IT’S

133
00:04:06,081 --> 00:04:07,072
THE ETHOS OF JESUS, AND IT’S UNCHISUN

134
00:04:07,116 --> 00:04:08,340
UNCHISUN UN-CHRISTIAN

135
00:04:08,384 --> 00:04:08,774
UN-CHRISTIAN UN-CHRISTIAN.

00:04:14,523 --> 00:04:15,013
HAVE SAID THIS IS A BRIDGE TOO FAR FOR US.

141
00:04:15,024 --> 00:04:15,747
FAR FOR US. >> YEAH.
