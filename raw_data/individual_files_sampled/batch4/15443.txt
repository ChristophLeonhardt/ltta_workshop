the meeting between President Trump and kim jeong-hoon has been on the minds of nearly everyone in america and much of the rest of the world now for me being born in the 80s all I have really ever known his conflict between the Koreas and between DPRK and the rest of the world but their resolve or future resolve of this conflict isn't really even something that candidate Trump was elected on but it sure is something that he is running with now and of course Hollywood is doubting his success and rooting for his failure as Bill Maher admitted earlier this week the left is rooting for Trump's failure because they believe that that's the only way to get rid of him by the way they will not get rid of him especially now anyway late night hosts had a grand old time casting dispersions and doubt that this meeting was anything other than Kabuki theater and a terrible decision by this administration that resulted in propping up a dictator and playing into his hand for worldwide domination because remember according to the left Trump being elected will be the end of the world so let's just go through a few of the transcripts from the days leading up to the Sun little Jimmy Kimmel during his show said that the two leaders would fall in love because of their similarities which is ironic because shutting down the beliefs of others something he does regularly essentially cutting off their freedoms as actually the objective of the left not Donald Trump on his show Jimmy Kimmel said this tonight's meeting will be one-on-one with a couple of translators and that's it Trump said he hopes that he and kim jeong-hoon like each other Kim is a brutal dictator who stars his people and murders his political enemies they're definitely going to like each other they might even fall in love my hope is that the summit ends with Trump giving kim jeong-hoon a rose and kim jeong-hoon eating it obviously making a reference to the TV show The Bachelor shameless plug for his own network programming on ABC Stephen Colbert who I usually find to be even more belligerent and says ignorant as Jimmy Kimmel he actually took a softer approach in an interview with in this MSNBC's Chris Matthews he said this the objective is denuclearization which I said is a worthy goal if he can get it god bless him give him the Nobel Prize I don't care just make the world safer he goes on to say this but experts are saying that the chance they will give up their nukes are very slim and yet Kim gets what he wants which is equal footing with the most powerful man in the world okay first of all equal footing give me a freakin break liberals saw this as a bad thing because again seeing Trump succeed is like salt on a slug but also they think that this elevates Kim jong-un and gives him credibility but wouldn't you say that that's better than say I don't know pallets of cash worth a half a million dollars I certainly would so here are the reasons why I think this time around is different because everyone is talking about how North Korea has made this promise before and they didn't make good on their end of the bargain and that's definitely true but there are some major differences this time around major differences number one last time there was no signature it was basically a verbal commitment things are different when pen hits the pad number two oh hey there mister brutal dictator signing that piece of paper we see you yes we saw him sign it it was televised as both leaders signed the agreement what does that matter worldwide attention and worldwide credibility and meat that means that we will be trolling you Chairman Kim we are holding you accountable the whole world will be and difference number three your own country will also be trolling you because guess what coverage of this summit was all over DPRK state television so they're gonna be holding you accountable to another difference and we learned this lesson from another little Jimmy Jimmy Carter and old Slick Willy Bill Clinton no payments up front in fact the opposite we are sustaining our sanctions until terms are met and difference number five for where am I the threat of repercussion was non-existent before this time around chairman Kim knows that Trump will put his money where his mouth and that if he does not hold up his end of the bargain there will be swift and severe repercussions so Jimmy Kimmel establishment politicians liberals Hollywood elites suck it it's gonna happen and it's gonna be so good and Trump is going to get another four years for it and hopefully a Peace Prize and it's going to make you even more deranged than you already are but you have no one to blame but yourselves after all it's thanks to your peeps kicking the can down the road that this is even an issue everybody thanks so much for watching I'm Amanda head for the rebel if you enjoyed my commentary and want to hear more from all of us here at the rebels subscribe to our premium content at www.affordablecomm.com
