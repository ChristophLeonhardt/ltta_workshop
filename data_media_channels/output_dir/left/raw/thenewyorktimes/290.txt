1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,520
“We want change,
we want change ...”

2
00:00:02,520 --> 00:00:05,700
“I don’t understand why
I could still go in a store

3
00:00:05,700 --> 00:00:07,650
and buy a weapon of war.”

4
00:00:07,650 --> 00:00:10,680
“There’s no better time than
now to talk about gun control.”

5
00:00:10,680 --> 00:00:13,380
These are calls the
American public has heard before.

6
00:00:14,220 --> 00:00:15,430
After Orlando —

7
00:00:15,430 --> 00:00:17,820
“Democrats and Republicans
we spoke with agree,

8
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:20,340
suspected terrorists,
like the Orlando shooter,

9
00:00:20,340 --> 00:00:22,810
should not be allowed
to purchase firearms.”

10
00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:24,450
After Sandy Hook —

11
00:00:24,450 --> 00:00:28,800
“90 percent of Americans support
universal background checks.”

12
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:30,480
After each mass
shooting, there’s

13
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:32,910
a surge of public support
for stricter gun control.

14
00:00:32,910 --> 00:00:35,070
“A new poll from
Quinnipiac University

15
00:00:35,070 --> 00:00:38,340
shows record high support
for stricter gun laws.”

16
00:00:38,340 --> 00:00:41,430
So why hasn’t Washington put
stricter gun laws on the books?

17
00:00:41,430 --> 00:00:44,760
There are several factors,
ranging from partisan divides

18
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:48,410
to gun owner activism to
the N.R.A.'s political clout.

19
00:00:49,650 --> 00:00:51,960
No. 1: There’s
broad support, but also

20
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:53,820
big divisions on gun control.

21
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:56,490
The most comprehensive
data is from 2017,

22
00:00:56,490 --> 00:00:58,740
and it shows that
60 percent of Americans

23
00:00:58,740 --> 00:01:00,720
say they want
stricter gun laws.

24
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:02,340
Support is even higher for
things like

25
00:01:02,340 --> 00:01:04,650
a 30-day waiting period for gun sales

26
00:01:04,650 --> 00:01:06,640
and universal background checks.

27
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:10,060
But dig deeper, and you find
the devil is in the details —

28
00:01:10,060 --> 00:01:11,770
and the divides.

29
00:01:11,770 --> 00:01:14,770
Most Democratic voters
want stricter gun laws.

30
00:01:14,770 --> 00:01:17,700
But less than 1 in 4
Republicans agree.

31
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:19,860
Most Americans who
don’t own firearms

32
00:01:19,860 --> 00:01:23,190
say easy access to legal
guns fuels gun violence.

33
00:01:23,190 --> 00:01:25,490
Fewer than half
of gun owners agree

34
00:01:25,490 --> 00:01:28,350
Non-owners want to ban
assault-style weapons,

35
00:01:28,350 --> 00:01:30,620
while most gun owners don’t.

36
00:01:30,620 --> 00:01:33,000
“The person is the criminal,
not the weapon.”

37
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,160
Gun owners may be a
minority, but they’re

38
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:37,860
a very focused and
vocal minority.

39
00:01:37,860 --> 00:01:40,530
Only about 3 in 10
Americans own a gun.

40
00:01:40,530 --> 00:01:43,590
But to them, gun control is
not merely a policy issue —

41
00:01:43,590 --> 00:01:44,580
it’s personal.

42
00:01:44,580 --> 00:01:47,790
Nearly 40 percent say they always
have a loaded firearm

43
00:01:47,790 --> 00:01:49,440
at the ready in their home.

44
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:51,700
74 percent say the
right to own a gun

45
00:01:51,700 --> 00:01:53,940
is “essential” to their freedom.

46
00:01:53,940 --> 00:01:56,850
Gun owners are much more
likely to contact lawmakers

47
00:01:56,850 --> 00:01:59,670
about gun policy,
compared to non-owners,

48
00:01:59,670 --> 00:02:03,810
and far more likely to donate
to gun advocacy and policy groups.

49
00:02:03,810 --> 00:02:07,590
No. 3: The N.R.A. is a
formidable force in politics.

50
00:02:07,590 --> 00:02:09,870
Less than 20 percent of gun
owners in America

51
00:02:09,870 --> 00:02:11,730
say they belong to the N.R.A.,

52
00:02:11,730 --> 00:02:13,620
but it’s big enough,
and disciplined enough,

53
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:16,620
to turn elections and to
end political careers.

54
00:02:16,620 --> 00:02:18,680
Part of what makes the N.R.A.
so formidable

55
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:19,650
is the money it spends

56
00:02:19,650 --> 00:02:21,000
helping friendly
politicians

57
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,880
and attacking those deemed enemies.

58
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:24,990
“Ross voted against your gun rights.”

59
00:02:24,990 --> 00:02:26,670
The N.R.A.'s vast
marketing efforts

60
00:02:26,670 --> 00:02:29,010
have helped turn gun
ownership into a badge

61
00:02:29,010 --> 00:02:30,100
of cultural identity.

62
00:02:30,100 --> 00:02:31,470
“It is not about politics.

63
00:02:31,470 --> 00:02:32,880
It is a way of life.

64
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:35,200
I feel like we should be able
to express that.”

65
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:37,110
And their catchphrases
have become ubiquitous.

66
00:02:37,110 --> 00:02:38,840
”You know, the guns don't kill people,"

67
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:40,630
people kill people.”

68
00:02:40,630 --> 00:02:44,160
No. 4: The N.R.A.'s
leaders are more hard-line

69
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:45,820
than its members.

70
00:02:45,820 --> 00:02:48,930
Polls show the N.R.A. members
do support some gun control policies,

71
00:02:48,930 --> 00:02:51,910
like outlawing sales
to the mentally ill,

72
00:02:51,910 --> 00:02:54,070
and people on terror watch lists.

73
00:02:54,070 --> 00:02:56,900
Most also favor
universal background checks.

74
00:02:56,900 --> 00:02:59,820
But time and time again,
N.R.A. leaders in Washington

75
00:02:59,820 --> 00:03:01,460
work to kill these proposals.

76
00:03:01,460 --> 00:03:02,650
After Sandy Hook,

77
00:03:02,650 --> 00:03:05,410
N.R.A. leaders flipped the
script on mass shootings.

78
00:03:05,410 --> 00:03:07,920
Instead of combating calls
for new gun control,

79
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:10,010
they actually demanded
more gun rights.

80
00:03:10,010 --> 00:03:15,640
“The only thing that stops
a bad guy with a gun

81
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:17,720
is a good guy with a gun.”

82
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:19,360
And finally, no. 5.

83
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:22,610
Are Americans really clamoring
for more gun control?

84
00:03:22,610 --> 00:03:24,080
Maybe not.

85
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:26,840
We see spikes and public
support for stricter laws

86
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:30,600
in the wake of mass shootings
like Columbine, Sandy Hook

87
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:32,140
and Las Vegas.

88
00:03:32,140 --> 00:03:33,760
But in a matter of weeks,

89
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:34,700
the bumps fade.

90
00:03:34,700 --> 00:03:37,880
In fact, overall Americans
have actually less supportive

91
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:40,300
of gun control over the past 25 years.

92
00:03:41,120 --> 00:00:00,000
The shootings, meanwhile,
continue.
