after a year of hunting there's no evidence that any of this was done in cooperation with anyone in the Trump campaign is that the real headline that's certainly one of the headlines to come out of the Friday announcement there's no evidence of any collusion with the Trump campaign that hasn't stopped CNN you know they went to the home of a trump supporter who happened to share a facebook post she agreed with that she didn't realize was sponsored by Russian trolls and they tried to insinuate that she was part of this Russian campaign and this poor woman was hounded on her front lawn by CNN you know it's just totally ridiculous the people who are determined to drive Trump out of office because he's allegedly some kind of foreign agent of Vladimir Putin or something like that they will latch on to any fact even if it controverts their own argument and they will latch on to anything with the word Russia in it and try to make it bend to their narrative yeah but I think you know if you look at what the trolls were accused of doing I mean aside from the fact that it may not have complied with campaign finance laws and a mailer compliant complied with lobbying disclosures there's nothing actually wrong constitutionally or legally with what they did there are troll farms that exist in this country there are domestic troll farms George Soros and the networks that he funds they are known to run commenters who go on to websites and leave anti conservative comments who troll others on Twitter right now how my own organization my company Breitbart news is being trolled by people sometimes anonymous on Twitter and they're part of organized efforts and sometimes these are well-funded organized efforts and it's perfectly legal it's irritating but it's the First Amendment it's freedom of speech so it's not clear to me that there's any real constitutional validity to this prosecution that they announced on Friday because the Russian troll farm was simply doing what people are entitled to do in the United States including foreigners the First Amendment is not exclusive to American citizens on American soil if you're here you know the right to freedom of speech now that might mean you also have to register if you're a lobbyist you might have to report any sort of in-kind contributions to one campaign or another but it's not clear where they really violated those laws so we're gonna see if this prosecution moves ahead but I just think it's laughable but then people think this is some sort of new activity I mean there's so much astroturf out there David Axelrod used it to help Obama Robert creamer used it to help Hillary Clinton this is not new this these are the sort of tactics Americans use all the time in elections this Russian one was spectacularly ineffective in terms of changing the elective election outcome but spectacularly effective in dividing Americans over that outcome and playing into divisions that the media were already created that's an excerpt from my daily TV show the Ezra Levante show no one leaves behind a paywall but I thought you'd like this video so we put it on YouTube if you want to subscribe to watch the daily show every day including always two interviews a day and I read my hate mail just click on this screen and become a Premium Member you
