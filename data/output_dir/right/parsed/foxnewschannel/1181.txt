LEGAL TEAM IN JANUARY SAID HE
DID DICTATE THE STATEMENT.
MARTHA?
>> Martha: OKAY.
THANK YOU FOR THE UPDATE FROM
THE WHITE HOUSE TONIGHT.
JUDGE NAPOLITANO JOINS US NOW.
JUDGE, WHAT DO YOU THINK?
>> I THINK THAT THE LETTER WAS
A DISGRACE AND HARMFUL.
>> Martha: THE JANUARY MEM
ROW?
>> JANUARY MEMO.
I DON'T KNOW HOW IT GOT OUT OR
WHY THE WHITE HOUSE WOULD LEAK
IT.
IT SHOWS SOPHOMORE RICK VIEW
OF -- SOPHOMORIC VIEW OF THE
LAW.
THEY CITED THE WRONG STATUTE.
THIS IS SAYING TWO THINGS.
THE PRESIDENT CANNOT COMMIT
OBSTRUCTION OF JUSTICE BECAUSE
HE CAN ORDER ANYBODY
PROSECUTED OR FIRE ANYBODY HE
WANTS.
HE CAN.
BUT IF HE DOES SO FOR A
CORRUPT PURPOSE THAT WOULD BE
THE DEFINITION OF OBSTRUCTION
OF JUSTICE.
THEY FORGOT THAT PART.
THE SECOND ARGUMENT THEY MAKE
HE CAN INTERFERE WITH THEFEIN
THEFEIN -- F.B.I.
INVESTIGATION.
BUT THAT IS NOT OBSTRUCTION.
BUT THAT WAS AMENDED 2002 TO
SAY IF IT INTENDED TO PRODUCE
EVIDENCE --
>> Martha: THESE ARE LAWYERS
FOR THE PRESIDENT OF THE
UNITED STATES.
YOU THINK HE HAS A GOOD LEGAL
TEAM.
NOW HE HAS RUDY GIULIANI AND
JAY SEKULOW.
>> IT'S DIFFICULT FOR ME TO
CRITICIZE THEM BECAUSE I KNOW
THEM ALL PERSONALLY AND
INTERACTED WITH MANY.
JAY HERE AND OTHERS IN THE
OTHER ENVIRONMENTS.
>> Martha: SURE.
>> BUT THEY ARE NOT SERVING
HIM WELL WHEN THEY NEEDLESSLY
SHOW THEIR CARDS AND SAY HE
CAN IMPEACH HIMSELF.
WHY RAISE THE ISSUE?
RUDY GIULIANI --
>> Martha: HE COULD PARDON
HIMSELF.
>> A -- CORRECT.
A BRILLIANT PROSECUTOR SAYING
THAT HE COULD ORDER JAMES
COMEY SHOT IN THE OVAL OFFICE
AND NOT PROSECUTED FOR THAT?
THAT IS ABSURD AND VIOLATION
OF THE LAW.
HE COULD BE ARRESTED, TRIED,
RELEASED OR TRIED AFTER HE
LEAVES THE WHITE HOUSE.
BUT NO ONE WOULD LET THE
ATTEMPTED MURDER OR MURDER NOT
TO BE CHARGED.
GIULIANI KNOWS THAT.
>> Martha: SHOULD HE FIRE
GIULIANI FOR THAT?
>> I DON'T KNOW.
THEY HAVE A RELATIONSHIP OF
WHICH I'M UNFAMILIAR.
PERHAPS THE TRUMP WANTS RUDY
CAUSING THE CHAOS.
BUT HE IS CAUSING CHAOS AND HE
CAUSING PEOPLE LIKE YOU AND ME
AND THE COLLEAGUES HERE AND
ELSEWHERE TO TALK ABOUT THE
ABSURD OFF-THE-WALL THINGS
LIKE CAN THE PRESIDENT PARDON
HIMSELF?
>> Martha: THE 500th DAY
OF THE PRESIDENCY.
THE PRESIDENT TWEETED ONE
TWEET ABOUT THAT.
HE FEELS HE GOT SO MUCH
ACCOMPLISHED BUT DID PROBABLY
NINE OR TEN OVER THE WEEKEND
ABOUT ALL OF THIS.
>> THE PRESIDENT HAS MUCH OF
WHICH TO BE PROUD ON HIS
500th DAY IN OFFICE.
BUT WHETHER OR NOT HE SHOULD
PARDON HIMSELF IS NOT AMONG
THEM.
MOST RESPECTFULLY, IF BOB
MUELLER'S OFFICE IS
UNCONSTITUTIONAL, WHY DID YOU
SANCTION THE RUSSIANS THAT HE
INDICTED AND WHY ARE YOU
LAWYERS INTERACTING WITH AN
UNCONSTITUTIONAL ENTITY?
I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE ANSWER
WOULD BE.
>> Martha: GOOD ARGUMENT.
