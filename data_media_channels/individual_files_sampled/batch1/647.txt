for 32 years Filipinos have come together to celebrate a watershed moment in their history when a revolution forced President Ferdinand Marcos from power in recent years that unity has been tainted by partisan politics between political dynasties and concerns the current leader Rodrigo Duterte is too nostalgic of the Marcos era it's important to stand up now especially since last year we saw that this administration blatantly disregarded our history that they buried the dictator Marcos and now he sees the same authoritarian tendencies from the current regime from the current government after 20 years in power Marcos was toppled in an army backed revolt after he was accused of cheating in the presidential election when Filipinos flooded Edson a main road in Manila demanding an end to corruption and human rights abuses thousands were killed for voicing opposition to his rule Duterte war on drugs reminds many of a darker time because thousands more Filipinos have been killed despite that and opposition from these protesters and others such as the Roman Catholic Church Duterte remains popular able to withstand whatever criticism he gets from rights groups the media and his political opponents Ed said evolution that we are celebrating decades more than three decades after continues to define what we are as a nation which is a Democratic Society a republican government where there is a rule of law not of men the problem with EDA is after that so we all went home Duterte wished the protesters well calling the anniversary a time for unity in the name of democracy but unlike his predecessors he wasn't there to deliver his message or hear how polarized his policies have made these Filipinos feel Andrew Chappell al Jazeera
