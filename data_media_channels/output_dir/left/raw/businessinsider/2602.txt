1
00:00:00,110 --> 00:00:02,760
- You had to be deaf,
dumb, and blind not to see

2
00:00:02,760 --> 00:00:04,310
what was going on.

3
00:00:04,310 --> 00:00:08,450
And in particular you had
to be willfully ignorant

4
00:00:08,450 --> 00:00:11,723
if you didn't see the implications
of the Ryazan incident.

5
00:00:26,940 --> 00:00:31,280
In the summer of 1999 the approval rating

6
00:00:31,280 --> 00:00:34,640
of former President Yeltsin was 2%.

7
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:38,700
There appeared to be no
chance whatever that Putin,

8
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:41,600
who was designated by
Yeltsin as his successor

9
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:44,890
could possibly become the
next Russian president.

10
00:00:44,890 --> 00:00:47,720
The apartment bombings changed everything.

11
00:00:47,720 --> 00:00:50,090
It was said after those buildings went up

12
00:00:50,090 --> 00:00:53,413
that now we're living in a
completely different country.

13
00:01:01,550 --> 00:01:05,640
Putin came forward as the
savior of the country.

14
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:09,750
He was put in charge of a war in Chechnya.

15
00:01:09,750 --> 00:01:11,640
The bombings were blamed on Chechens

16
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:16,640
without any evidence
whatsoever, and as a result of

17
00:01:17,450 --> 00:01:20,400
the successful prosecution of that war,

18
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:23,603
against all odds he was elected
the next Russian president.

19
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:37,330
The apartment bombings
appear to be the keystone

20
00:01:37,330 --> 00:01:41,960
of a plot to confuse
Russian public opinion,

21
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:46,460
to create terror, to
distract the Russian public,

22
00:01:46,460 --> 00:01:50,320
to redirect their anger
away from the corruption

23
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:55,320
that had flourished under
Yeltsin, and toward the Chechens

24
00:01:55,670 --> 00:01:58,140
who had had for a number of years

25
00:01:58,140 --> 00:02:01,570
a semi-independent government in Chechnya

26
00:02:01,570 --> 00:02:05,290
and in that way create the
conditions for the Russian people

27
00:02:05,290 --> 00:02:09,520
to vote in what they absolutely
consciously did not want,

28
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:12,930
which was a successor to Yeltsin
who would protect Yeltsin.

29
00:02:12,930 --> 00:02:15,010
There was an enormous amount of material

30
00:02:15,010 --> 00:02:19,200
in the Russian newspaper
Novaya Gazeta which pointed to

31
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:22,970
the possibility and in
fact to the likelihood

32
00:02:22,970 --> 00:02:27,100
that the authorities themselves
blew up those buildings.

33
00:02:27,100 --> 00:02:30,969
At the same time a fifth
bomb was discovered

34
00:02:30,969 --> 00:02:34,620
in the basement of an
apartment building in Ryazan,

35
00:02:34,620 --> 00:02:36,880
which is a city southeast of Moscow.

36
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:41,430
And I went to Ryazan after
the bomb was discovered

37
00:02:41,430 --> 00:02:44,870
and diffused to talk to local
residents and it was clear

38
00:02:44,870 --> 00:02:48,570
from those conversations
that what took place

39
00:02:48,570 --> 00:02:51,440
was a genuine attempt to
blow up a fifth building.

40
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:53,190
The authorities said that this was only

41
00:02:53,190 --> 00:02:57,350
a training exercise, but
it was nothing of the kind.

42
00:02:57,350 --> 00:03:00,670
And what was most important
was that three persons

43
00:03:00,670 --> 00:03:04,240
were arrested for putting a
bomb in a building in Ryazan.

44
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:06,230
They turned out to be not Chechens,

45
00:03:06,230 --> 00:03:08,820
not terrorists in the usual sense,

46
00:03:08,820 --> 00:03:12,480
but rather agents of the
Federal Securities Service

47
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:14,050
which is the FSB.

48
00:03:14,050 --> 00:03:17,623
I asked for documents
from the CIA from the FBI,

49
00:03:18,618 --> 00:03:21,310
from the directorate of
national intelligence

50
00:03:21,310 --> 00:03:22,550
from the state department.

51
00:03:22,550 --> 00:03:25,270
I got very, very little
that was of any use.

52
00:03:25,270 --> 00:03:28,800
But I did get a few documents
from the state department

53
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:31,750
which indicated that their
sources of information

54
00:03:31,750 --> 00:03:34,580
were telling them that
the apartment bombings

55
00:03:34,580 --> 00:03:36,340
were extremely suspicious.

56
00:03:36,340 --> 00:03:39,080
You had to be deaf, dumb,
and blind not to see

57
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:40,610
what was going on.

58
00:03:40,610 --> 00:03:44,770
And in particular you had
to be willfully ignorant

59
00:03:44,770 --> 00:03:48,960
if you didn't see the implications
of the Ryazan incident

60
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:52,650
in which three FSB agents
were arrested for putting

61
00:03:52,650 --> 00:03:55,620
a fifth bomb in a building,
even though the bomb

62
00:03:55,620 --> 00:03:58,590
didn't go off it was a live bomb.

63
00:03:58,590 --> 00:00:00,000
What was it doing in the basement
of an apartment building?
