rational elections is it is it possible there could be anything that we're gonna go to the president now he's speaking again he's a very talented that was the president in another handshake with Kim jong-un this time the president sang an answer to a question what did he learn about Kim today he said and this is the highest compliment you can get from Donald Trump he said I learned he's a very talented man and Jason Johnson that is the president's favorite word when it comes to a high compliment he sees everything in terms of that word that rules show business talent oh yes Talent performing a lot of people don't know this I was waiting for him to actually say a lot of people don't know this ken plays the piano or something like that I mean but again you know this is what I was saying before about this may be a present uniquely suited to speak to Kim Jong hoon because they both understand the power of flattery because they're both grotesquely insecure men despite having a tremendous amount of control domestically now again I also think he sort of told on himself here with this second set of questions and these awkward handshakes they're doing in the hallway he said we're gonna meet many times that's probably the deal that that's probably what they signed that they're going to have future meetings if those meetings accomplish anything I don't know is dinners Rodman gonna be there as Pompeo gonna be there but they probably just agreed that they're gonna have future meetings and Trump will continue to say that chemist talented and Kim will say things about him back home and both of them will feel like they accomplished something when in fact nothing has really changed ambassador Michael McFaul on this notion that they're gonna meet many times the next thing that will be in the air the next question that will be in the air is will there be a White House meeting should there be some threshold for that well Lawrence I want to see the document I want to see the word denuclearization in the document as a goal that has been agreed to without that that the process doesn't matter let's just be clear about that if we haven't agreed to what is the objective that has been agreed to by both sides then the other meetings as just process and I think we should say it's a failure but if it is there and if Kim jong-un has just signed a piece of paper saying he is signing up for a process to get rid of all of his nuclear weapons that would be an achievement now live from Singapore by NBC News global correspondent bill Neely bill are there any indication about what the two leaders have just signed no none whatsoever they've signed the document president Trump calls it very important and pretty comprehensive you know the easy part is over the photo-op and signing this document now the hard part begins whatever's in it and we'll be listening very closely and watching very closely as your previous contributor said four words like denuclearization or verifiable or irreversible but you know the hard part will take place over the next months on years lots of fine words here you know Kim said the world will see a major change it's a historic meeting we're determined to leave the past behind but we've heard fine words from the North Koreans before I mean they've signed agreements before 1994 chiefly but also when the 2000 agreements to shut down a nuclear reactor agreements to freeze work on nuclear weapons and tests even signing the nuclear non-proliferation treaty 1994 big agreement and then we discovered in 2002 that they had been cheating all along Kim is playing the long game here here's a guy who wants to be in power for 20 30 40 years he knows president Trump will only be in power for three years or seven years the skeptics would say he's just trying to weight the United States oh now whether that's true or not we still again going back to what I said we don't know what's in this agreement yes the optics are great and this will go down very very well in North Korea because here is the leader of the US and North Korea on equal status look at the flags behind the two leaders six North Korean flags six American flags the numbers of officials matching exactly on each side in North Korean terms this is their leader not just being treated as a normal leader but being treated as an equal to the most powerful man on the planet this will go down well in North Korea but going back to your first question what's in it will possibly find out when we hear from President Trump at a news conference here in a few hours time lawrence ambassador McFaul the the president we've seen tonight is a president who's treating the dictator of North Korea with more respect than we have seen him give any other head of state yeah I don't like the photo-op just to be clear I'm glad it plays well in North Korea it doesn't play well here in Palo Alto with me there's no reason you have to use that language to sign that deal and again try it we're waiting to see what it is right that will tell a lot of things but you don't need to call them your best friend to sign a deal about nuclear weapons
