I want to bring back the anchor of this hour my partner in friend Ali Velshi who is outside CNN's headquarters in New York with Senator Jeff Flake it needs to so it can be done politicians very responsibility to do it and if we can you know if we can model better behavior I think as politicians candidates will pick up on it and you know I think the voters need to reward it as well yeah right now there's no political market for saying I'm going to reach across the aisle yeah if you say that in a campaign it ends up in your opponent's ads it can't be that way what can because you haven't been shy about about saying what the president can do this is a moment fortunately it hasn't no bombs have gone off her mark no one has been injured but this is one of those moments that scares the nation a little bit is what can the president frankly his words just a few moments ago were great he said what he should have said we've got to tone it down and be more civil I hope he follows it through and we'll see in the next rally for example when you which will happen tonight tonight I mean if they're lock her up chance that he doesn't say hey that's inappropriate don't do that or if he is talking about a journalist it's been beat up and that's okay I mean that's that's wrong he needs to follow up what he said with actions and and if he models that kind of behavior it helps the rest of the politicians as well this has been a bit of a cause of yours now what happens when you're not in office when you're not running again where do you take that platform to have this particular conversation about civility and respect in politics I'll still be around I'll use any platform I can we have to change there are big problems that we've got to face there are real enemies that we have outside of this country to bigger enemies to be creating those amongst us yeah and treating our political opponents as if they're enemies so I'll be speaking out with whatever platform I have one question here our colleagues here at CNN are often criticized by the presidents or many of us that's okay but how do we get to the point where we understand that that's actually the job of the press that we are to hold you all to account on that that is I mean it's a politician's job to take it Franklin and I said the enemy of the people the president needs to know that that phrase does not have a noble pedigree and that we have a record number a number of journalists being detained and being killed overseas and and you can't you can't here be using that kind of language it's just just been senator thanks for your time thank you hey there I'm Chris Hayes from MSNBC thanks for watching MSNBC on youtube if you want to keep up to date with the videos we're putting out you can click subscribe just below me or click over on this list to see lots of other great videos
