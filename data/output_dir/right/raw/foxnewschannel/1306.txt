3
00:00:10,996 --> 00:00:12,398
ONE OF THE MOST

4
00:00:12,398 --> 00:00:13,198
DISTINGUISHED AND CERTAINLY

5
00:00:13,198 --> 00:00:14,300
ONE OF THE MOST FAMOUS

6
00:00:14,300 --> 00:00:16,535
LIBERALS IN THIS COUNTRY.

7
00:00:16,535 --> 00:00:17,970
INCREASINGLY HE DOESN'T HAVE

8
00:00:17,970 --> 00:00:19,738
MUCH HOME LEFT ON THE LEFT

9
00:00:19,738 --> 00:00:21,106
BECAUSE HE REFUSES TO

00:00:21,106 --> 00:00:22,041
PARTICIPATE IN DOG THAT THE

11
00:00:22,041 --> 00:00:24,276

PRESIDENT.

13
00:00:24,643 --> 00:00:26,145
DERSHOWITZ HAS SHARP SOLID

14
00:00:26,145 --> 00:00:26,712
CRITICIZED THE MUELLER

15
00:00:26,712 --> 00:00:27,212
INVESTIGATION.

16
00:00:27,212 --> 00:00:28,580
HE SAYS JUSTIFYING ATTACKS

FOR SAYING THAT HE SAYS HIS

20
00:00:32,718 --> 00:00:33,986
LIBERAL FRIENDS DON'T INVITE

21
00:00:33,986 --> 00:00:35,020
HIM TO DINNER PARTIES

22
00:00:35,020 --> 00:00:36,689
ANYMORE AND SOME BARK AT

23
00:00:36,689 --> 00:00:36,955
HIM.

24
00:00:36,955 --> 00:00:37,623
PROFESSOR DERSHOWITZ JOINS

25
00:00:37,623 --> 00:00:38,757

PROFESSOR, THANKS FOR COMING

27
00:00:39,692 --> 00:00:39,958

28
00:00:39,958 --> 00:00:41,527
>> THANK YOU.

29
00:00:41,527 --> 00:00:42,761
>> Tucker: YOU HAVE TAKEN

30
00:00:42,761 --> 00:00:44,229
UNPOPULAR, REALLY UNPOPULAR

31
00:00:44,229 --> 00:00:45,097
POSITIONS, SOME THAT I

32
00:00:45,097 --> 00:00:45,798
DISAGREE WITH OVER THE

33
00:00:45,798 --> 00:00:46,098
YEARS.

34
00:00:46,098 --> 00:00:47,733
AND YOU HAVEN'T HAD THIS

35
00:00:47,733 --> 00:00:48,067
PROBLEM.

36
00:00:48,067 --> 00:00:49,468
>> NO.

37
00:00:49,468 --> 00:00:50,035
>> Tucker: WHAT'S THE

38
00:00:50,035 --> 00:00:50,436
DIFFERENCE?

39
00:00:50,436 --> 00:00:52,337
>> WELL, IT'S TRUMP.

40
00:00:52,337 --> 00:00:58,143
TRUMP CHANGES EVERYTHING.

41
00:00:58,143 --> 00:00:59,745
>> JUST YESTERDAY ON

42
00:00:59,745 --> 00:01:00,679
MARTHA'S VINEYARD THERE WAS

43
00:01:00,679 --> 00:01:01,513
A DINNER PARTY.

44
00:01:01,513 --> 00:01:03,749
MY WIFE AND I WAS NOT

45
00:01:03,749 --> 00:01:04,083
INVITED.

46
00:01:04,083 --> 00:01:05,016
APPARENTLY I WAS THE SUBJECT

47
00:01:05,016 --> 00:01:06,518
OF THE CONVERSATION.

48
00:01:06,518 --> 00:01:07,086
PEOPLE ASKING WHAT'S

49
00:01:07,086 --> 00:01:08,153
HAPPENED TO DERSHOWITZ?

50
00:01:08,153 --> 00:01:10,656
WHY HAS HE TURNED TO THE

51
00:01:10,656 --> 00:01:10,956
RIGHT?

52
00:01:10,956 --> 00:01:12,291
AND I WISH I HAD BEEN THERE

53
00:01:12,291 --> 00:01:13,325
BECAUSE I YOU WOULD HAVE

54
00:01:13,325 --> 00:01:14,526
POINTED MY FINGER AT MY

55
00:01:14,526 --> 00:01:15,527
LIBERAL FRIENDS AND SAID

56
00:01:15,527 --> 00:01:16,695
IT'S ALL YOUR FAULT.

57
00:01:16,695 --> 00:01:17,529
IF HAD YOU WORKED THIS HARD

58
00:01:17,529 --> 00:01:18,897
FOR THE ELECTION OF HILLARY

59
00:01:18,897 --> 00:01:20,365
CLINTON AS I DID AND IF SHE

60
00:01:20,365 --> 00:01:21,934
HAD BEEN ELECTED AND THEY

61
00:01:21,934 --> 00:01:23,168
WERE TRYING TO IMPEACH OR

62
00:01:23,168 --> 00:01:24,837
CHARGE HER, I WOULD BE

63
00:01:24,837 --> 00:01:25,804
SAYING EXACTLY THE SAME

64
00:01:25,804 --> 00:01:28,807
THINGS IN DEFENSE OF HER

65
00:01:28,807 --> 00:01:29,141
RIGHTS.

66
00:01:29,141 --> 00:01:30,142
AS I DID IN THE DEFENSE OF

67
00:01:30,142 --> 00:01:30,943
THE RIGHTS OF BILL CLINTON

68
00:01:30,943 --> 00:01:32,411
AND ALSO IN DEFENSE OF THE

69
00:01:32,411 --> 00:01:33,478
RIGHTS OF RICHARD NIXON

70
00:01:33,478 --> 00:01:36,214
GOING BACK TO THE 1970S.

71
00:01:36,214 --> 00:01:38,917
I HAVE NOT CHANGED.

72
00:01:38,917 --> 00:01:41,353
THEY HAVE.

73
00:01:41,353 --> 00:01:41,887
>> Tucker: JUST AS A

74
00:01:41,887 --> 00:01:42,587
REFERENCE POINT, YOU WERE

75
00:01:42,587 --> 00:01:43,822
INVOLVED IN THE DEFENSE FOR

76
00:01:43,822 --> 00:01:46,458
A LITTLE WHILE ANYWAY OF

77
00:01:46,458 --> 00:01:47,959
O.J. SIMPSON ACCUSED OF

78
00:01:47,959 --> 00:01:49,294
KILLING TO TWO PEOPLE WITH A

79
00:01:49,294 --> 00:01:49,594
KNIFE.

80
00:01:49,594 --> 00:01:51,396
WHEN YOU WENT TO MARTHA'S

81
00:01:51,396 --> 00:01:53,031
VINEYARD DURING THOSE YEARS

82
00:01:53,031 --> 00:01:54,699
IN 1995 AND 1996, DID PEOPLE

83
00:01:54,699 --> 00:01:55,967
ATTACK YOU AT DINNER PARTIES

84
00:01:55,967 --> 00:01:56,334
FOR THAT.

85
00:01:56,334 --> 00:01:57,269
>> A LITTLE BIT.

86
00:01:57,269 --> 00:01:58,537
NOT AS MUCH AS THIS.

87
00:01:58,537 --> 00:01:59,438
NEVER BEEN LIKE THIS.

88
00:01:59,438 --> 00:02:01,106
THIS TIME IT INCLUDES SOME

89
00:02:01,106 --> 00:02:02,107
OF MY RELATIVES.

90
00:02:02,107 --> 00:02:03,208
AS I SAID THE ONLY THING

91
00:02:03,208 --> 00:02:04,876
THAT HURTS ME IS THAT UP

92
00:02:04,876 --> 00:02:06,812
UNTIL NOW PEOPLE WHO ARE MY

93
00:02:06,812 --> 00:02:07,979
RELATIVES WOULD TELL ME OH,

94
00:02:07,979 --> 00:02:09,247
PEOPLE COME OVER TO YOU AND

95
00:02:09,247 --> 00:02:13,385
SAID YOU ARE RELATED TO ALAN

96
00:02:13,385 --> 00:02:14,486
DERSHOWITZ, WOW NOW THEY

97
00:02:14,486 --> 00:02:16,721
SAID YOU ARE RELATED TO ALAN

98
00:02:16,721 --> 00:02:17,522
DERSHOWITZ HOW CAN YOU

99
00:02:17,522 --> 00:02:18,623
JUSTIFY WHAT HE HAS BEEN

100
00:02:18,623 --> 00:02:19,524
SAYING ABOUT DONALD TRUMP?

101
00:02:19,524 --> 00:02:21,660
SO IT EFFECTS MY RELATIVES.

102
00:02:21,660 --> 00:02:22,761
THAT HURTS ME.

103
00:02:22,761 --> 00:02:23,762
I HAVE A THICK SKIN.

104
00:02:23,762 --> 00:02:24,796
I HAVE BEEN DOING THIS FOR

105
00:02:24,796 --> 00:02:25,096
YEARS.

106
00:02:25,096 --> 00:02:26,364
I HAVE DEVELOPED THE

107
00:02:26,364 --> 00:02:27,466
THICKEST SKIN IMAGINABLE.

108
00:02:27,466 --> 00:02:29,167
BY THE WAY, A LOT OF THE

109
00:02:29,167 --> 00:02:30,969
TWEETS THAT I GET HUNDREDS

110
00:02:30,969 --> 00:02:33,638
OF TWEETS AND MESSAGES A LOT

111
00:02:33,638 --> 00:02:36,608
OF THEM, NOT ONLY FOCUS ON

112
00:02:36,608 --> 00:02:37,242
WHAT I HAVE BEEN SAYING

113
00:02:37,242 --> 00:02:38,210
ABOUT THE CONSTITUTIONAL

114
00:02:38,210 --> 00:02:39,778
RIGHTS OF DONALD TRUMP, BUT

115
00:02:39,778 --> 00:02:42,647
THEY RELATED TO ME BEING

116
00:02:42,647 --> 00:02:45,450
PRO-ISRAEL AND JEWISH AND

117
00:02:45,450 --> 00:02:46,451
MAKING ANTI-SEMITIC THING

118
00:02:46,451 --> 00:02:47,552
OUT OF IT AS WELL.

119
00:02:47,552 --> 00:02:49,521
AND SO, YOU KNOW, THERE IS

120
00:02:49,521 --> 00:02:52,090
NOT ONLY SOME -- TOO MUCH

121
00:02:52,090 --> 00:02:53,058
ANTISEMITISM ON THE RIGHT,

122
00:02:53,058 --> 00:02:54,559
THERE IS QUITE A BIT ON IT

123
00:02:54,559 --> 00:02:58,763
ON THE ANTI-TRUMP AS WELL.

124
00:02:58,763 --> 00:03:00,031
>> Tucker: I HAVE NOTICED

125
00:03:00,031 --> 00:03:01,199
THAT YOU HAVE BEEN AT THIS,

126
00:03:01,199 --> 00:03:03,368
I WOULDN'T WANT TO GUESS

127
00:03:03,368 --> 00:03:04,869
HALF A CENTURY.

128
00:03:04,869 --> 00:03:05,737
FOREFRONT OF THE CIVIL

129
00:03:05,737 --> 00:03:06,638
LIBERTARIAN LEFT.

130
00:03:06,638 --> 00:03:08,072
HAS THAT GROUP SHRUNK?

131
00:03:08,072 --> 00:03:09,407
IS IT NOT JUST TRUMP BUT

132
00:03:09,407 --> 00:03:10,708
MAYBE THE LEFT IS LESS

133
00:03:10,708 --> 00:03:11,843
INTERESTED IN TRADITIONAL

134
00:03:11,843 --> 00:03:12,844
CIVIL LIBERTIES THAN IT USED

135
00:03:12,844 --> 00:03:13,378
TO BE?

136
00:03:13,378 --> 00:03:15,847
>> SHRUNK, THERE ARE NO

137
00:03:15,847 --> 00:03:16,815
CIVIL LIBERTARIANS LEFT ON

138
00:03:16,815 --> 00:03:17,715
THE LEFT.

139
00:03:17,715 --> 00:03:18,917
CERTAINLY NOT THE AMERICAN

140
00:03:18,917 --> 00:03:19,551
CIVIL LIBERTIES UNION.

141
00:03:19,551 --> 00:03:20,752
THEY WERE THE ONES WHO SAID

142
00:03:20,752 --> 00:03:22,854
THAT THE RAID ON COHEN'S

143
00:03:22,854 --> 00:03:25,456
OFFICE TAKING HIS LAWYER

144
00:03:25,456 --> 00:03:26,858
CLIENT FILES WAS A GOOD

145
00:03:26,858 --> 00:03:27,158
THING.

146
00:03:27,158 --> 00:03:29,694
NOT EVEN SUGGESTING WHAT I

147
00:03:29,694 --> 00:03:31,129
SUGGESTED AND ULTIMATELY

148
00:03:31,129 --> 00:03:32,096
ADOPTED BY THE JUDGE TO HAVE

149
00:03:32,096 --> 00:03:33,998
A JUDICIAL MONITOR GOING

150
00:03:33,998 --> 00:03:34,332
THROUGH.

151
00:03:34,332 --> 00:03:35,967
ALL OF THESE EMAILS.

152
00:03:35,967 --> 00:03:37,402
THE ACLU IS DEAD IN THE

153
00:03:37,402 --> 00:03:38,803
WATER WHEN IT COMES TO

154
00:03:38,803 --> 00:03:40,104
DEFENDING THE CIVIL

155
00:03:40,104 --> 00:03:41,573
LIBERTIES OF PEOPLE WHO THEY

156
00:03:41,573 --> 00:03:42,507
DON'T AGREE WITH.

157
00:03:42,507 --> 00:03:43,842
AND THAT'S JUST AWFUL.

158
00:03:43,842 --> 00:03:45,810
THERE ARE STILL SOME CIVIL

159
00:03:45,810 --> 00:03:46,511
LIBERTARIANS LEFT.

160
00:03:46,511 --> 00:03:47,779
BUT YOU CAN COUNT THEM ON

161
00:03:47,779 --> 00:03:48,346
ONE HAND.

162
00:03:48,346 --> 00:03:49,447
EVERYBODY HAS TO PASS THE

163
00:03:49,447 --> 00:03:50,582
SHOE ON THE OTHER FOOT TEST.

164
00:03:50,582 --> 00:03:52,283
IF THE SHOE WERE ON THE

165
00:03:52,283 --> 00:03:53,318
OTHER FOOT, WOULD YOU BE

166
00:03:53,318 --> 00:03:54,619
TAKING THE SAME POSITION YOU

167
00:03:54,619 --> 00:03:55,753
ARE TAKING TODAY?

168
00:03:55,753 --> 00:03:56,688
I PASSED THAT TEST.

169
00:03:56,688 --> 00:03:57,856
THERE ARE SOME OTHERS WHO

170
00:03:57,856 --> 00:03:58,556
PASSED THAT TEST.

171
00:03:58,556 --> 00:03:59,858
BUT TOO MANY BOTH ON THE

172
00:03:59,858 --> 00:04:01,459
RIGHT AND ON THE LEFT DON'T

173
00:04:01,459 --> 00:04:03,328
PASS THE TEST.

174
00:04:03,328 --> 00:04:03,862
>> Tucker: I AGREE.

175
00:04:03,862 --> 00:04:04,762
WITH HILLARY CLINTON HAD

176
00:04:04,762 --> 00:04:05,930
BEEN ELECTED A LOT OF THE

177
00:04:05,930 --> 00:04:06,731
PEOPLE SUPPORTING ME AND

178
00:04:06,731 --> 00:04:07,398
DEFINITING ME ON THE RIGHT

179
00:04:07,398 --> 00:04:09,500
WOULD BE ATTACKING ME FOR

180
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:10,168
CRITICIZING THE PROSECUTION

181
00:04:10,168 --> 00:04:11,035
OR THE IMPEACHMENT OF

182
00:04:11,035 --> 00:04:12,003
HILLARY CLINTON.

183
00:04:12,003 --> 00:04:14,005
WE NEED NEUTRAL PRINCIPLES.

184
00:04:14,005 --> 00:04:15,573
WE NEED STANDARDS OF

185
00:04:15,573 --> 00:04:16,874
CONSTITUTIONALITY THAT ARE

186
00:04:16,874 --> 00:04:19,010
APOLITICAL AND I REFUSE TO

187
00:04:19,010 --> 00:04:21,579
ALLOW PARTISAN POLITICS TO

188
00:04:21,579 --> 00:04:23,414
PREEMPT MY VIEWS ON THE

189
00:04:23,414 --> 00:04:24,215
CONSTITUTION WHICH HAVE

190
00:04:24,215 --> 00:04:25,783
STAYED THE SAME FOR 50

191
00:04:25,783 --> 00:04:26,351
YEARS.

192
00:04:26,351 --> 00:04:26,818
>> Tucker: AMEN.

193
00:04:26,818 --> 00:04:28,052
