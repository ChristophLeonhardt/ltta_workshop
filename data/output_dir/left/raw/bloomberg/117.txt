1
00:00:02,520 --> 00:00:06,380
Americans own more guns than anybody else
on earth.

2
00:00:06,380 --> 00:00:11,940
Firearms are involved in the deaths of more
than 33,000 people in the U.S. annually.

3
00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:15,340
Every time another mass shooting occurs in
the U.S.,

4
00:00:15,340 --> 00:00:18,200
it sparks arguments over gun ownership rights.

5
00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:19,620
Here's the situation.

6
00:00:19,620 --> 00:00:23,796
In 2017, pro-gun advocates got a boost when
Republicans gained control

7
00:00:23,796 --> 00:00:26,720
of the White House and both chambers of Congress.

8
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:31,690
In February Congressional Republicans rolled
back a rule adopted by President Barack Obama

9
00:00:31,690 --> 00:00:34,341
in 2016 that was aimed at preventing people with

10
00:00:34,341 --> 00:00:37,060
serious mental health problems from buying guns.

11
00:00:37,100 --> 00:00:41,720
"The yeas are 235 and the nays are 180. The joint resolution is passed."

12
00:00:41,720 --> 00:00:45,520
But that was just the most recent time Congress
has dealt with gun restrictions.

13
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:50,260
Back in 2013, Congress defeated a bill to expand
background checks.

14
00:00:50,260 --> 00:00:54,380
This was just months after a mass shooting
took place at Sandy Hook Elementary School

15
00:00:54,380 --> 00:00:57,600
in Newtown, Connecticut where 20 children
were killed.

16
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:01,580
In the U.S., 25 children die from bullet wounds
each week.

17
00:01:01,660 --> 00:01:04,080
Gun rules are largely determined by states.

18
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:10,080
Since 2013, Democrat led states like California
and Oregon have expanded gun restrictions.

19
00:01:10,090 --> 00:01:14,840
Though a majority of states have weakened restrictions
and many now permit guns in more places.

20
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:18,960
Like schools, restaurants, churches and public
buildings.

21
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:23,820
Also all 50 states allow people to carry weapons
that are concealed from public view

22
00:01:23,820 --> 00:01:27,819
and many states have expanded rights to use guns in
self defense.

23
00:01:27,820 --> 00:01:31,680
The U.S.'s original gun law is almost as old
as the country itself.

24
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:35,720
The Second Amendment right of the people to
keep and bear arms was established in the

25
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:41,520
18th century to allow states to form militias
to protect themselves against the federal government.

26
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:44,780
In 2008, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that
the amendment protected the

27
00:01:44,780 --> 00:01:47,700
gun rights of individuals, not just militias.

28
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:53,020
As many as 310 million guns are now thought
to be in private hands.

29
00:01:53,300 --> 00:01:54,880
Here's the argument.

30
00:01:54,889 --> 00:01:56,920
The National Rifle Association...

31
00:01:56,920 --> 00:01:57,920
"And let's fight for freedom."

32
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:02,300
and its allies argue that gun regulations
only hurt law abiding gun owners

33
00:02:02,300 --> 00:02:04,220
because criminals simply ignore them.

34
00:02:05,060 --> 00:02:08,424
Since Congress let a ban on assault weapons
expire in 2004,

35
00:02:08,424 --> 00:02:11,660
violent crime in America has fallen significantly.

36
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:15,760
And fatal and non-fatal shootings have also
declined.

37
00:02:15,860 --> 00:02:21,090
Meanwhile, gun control advocates say limiting
weapons will drive down gun related crimes.

38
00:02:21,090 --> 00:02:24,143
And they point to Australia where strict gun
ownership laws

39
00:02:24,143 --> 00:02:27,110
were enacted after a historic massacre in 1996.

40
00:02:27,110 --> 00:02:30,090
Since then there have been 0 mass shootings.

41
00:02:30,090 --> 00:02:33,170
And firearms related death rates have plummeted.

42
00:02:33,170 --> 00:02:38,380
So while politicians try to tighten or loosen
gun laws from one administration to the next,

43
00:02:38,380 --> 00:00:00,000
U.S. citizens continue to be caught in the
middle of this legislative gun fight.
