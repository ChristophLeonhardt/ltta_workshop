so after President Donald Trump announced that the US will rightfully recognize Jerusalem as Israel's capital and the US Embassy will be relocated there the usual suspects took umbrage to that Proclamation and decided to write some really terse letters to the editors of their local newspapers no they didn't do that rather the anti-us anti Israeli crowd responded with violence or they used their indoctrinated children as real-life props for photo ops but even more pathetic is a media that just can't bring itself to report on such hatred and violence because well I guess it just doesn't fit the progressive PC narrative now does it joining me in the studio is our fearless leader and rebel commander Ezra Levent great to have you again on rebel roundup Ezra I spear David fantastic now as we're surely news is news and when you see an identifiable group being targeted in this case Jews I would say it is unethical and irresponsible not to report this yet as the saying goes the silence is deafening however what do you think is the unspoken strategy behind the media turning a blind eye to certain Muslims behaving badly well that's the thing they they have a narrative and anything that falls outside their expected storyline they throw those facts out it would be like a scientist having a theory you know that's how the scientific process work you have a theory a hypothesis you test it against the facts if the facts don't fit your theory you throw out your hypothesis and come up with a new idea in journalism they do the opposite their narrative their hypothesis to explain the world their worldview is Muslims good Western world bad the only people who are anti-semitic are white neo-nazi skinheads if a Muslim does something anti-semitic trying to try not to see it if you see it try not to report it if he report it don't say it's Muslim if it's Muslim say it's not real Islam so the instead of changing their hypothesis they throw out the facts and the facts is the Muslim world is extremely anti-semitic not every single must and we know many wonderful Muslims including who work here at the rebel but the disproportion of Muslims don't like Jews they don't like Westerners and it comes from the Koran which is an anti infidel document and listen there's different ways to approach a Koran just like theirs you can take the Christian in the Jewish Bible in various degrees of literally also but these journalists turn a blind eye to it maybe a personal example three years ago in Calgary we had a pro-israel rally right outside City Hall there were some Palestinian men across the street with the Palestinian flag chanting at us and the cops were keeping them back there were a ton of journalists there they started chanting all Heil Hitler all hail Hitler now I don't think that should be against the law to say that but that sure is newsworthy isn't it you've got Palestinians chanting Heil Heil Hitler they were saying Heil Hitler in front of the cops face to a bunch of Jews and there were Calgary Herald reporters who were standing right there and saw it but they said these Palestinian youth are saying things I don't even want to report well then why don't you unreported hey that was an excerpt from my weekly show rebel roundup in which we highlight the best stories of the week with your favorite rebels if you want to see the full show please sign up to become a Premium Member you
