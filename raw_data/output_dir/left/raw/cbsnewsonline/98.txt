1
00:00:00,667 --> 00:00:02,735
HEARD MORE LATER ON AND WE 

2
00:00:02,735 --> 00:00:04,070
HEARD A LOT OF SIRENS AS WELL 

3
00:00:04,070 --> 00:00:04,837
SO FAR THIS MORNING. 

4
00:00:04,837 --> 00:00:09,476
>> WE ARE TALKING ABOUT A 

5
00:00:09,476 --> 00:00:12,512
SERIES OF GUNSHOTS, POTENTIALLY 

6
00:00:12,512 --> 00:00:13,480
SOME THAT -- SOMETHING PROMPTED 

7
00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:14,881
THAT INITIAL POLICE RESPONSE 

8
00:00:14,881 --> 00:00:18,184
THAT YOU SAW THEN HEARD MORE 

9
00:00:18,184 --> 00:00:18,751
SHOTS. 

10
00:00:18,751 --> 00:00:19,318
CAN YOU DESCRIBE THE SHOT? 

11
00:00:19,318 --> 00:00:20,586
WE HAD DESCRIPTIONS THAT IT WAS 

12
00:00:20,586 --> 00:00:23,022
NOT LIKE A BOOM LIKE A SHOTGUN 

13
00:00:23,022 --> 00:00:25,424
BUT A CRACK, CRACK LIKE A 

14
00:00:25,424 --> 00:00:26,592
HANDGUN OR ASSAULT RIFLE. 

15
00:00:26,592 --> 00:00:29,429
>> I FEEL LIKE IT WAS HANDGUN. 

16
00:00:29,429 --> 00:00:31,798
I'M GUESSING IT WAS WHATEVER 

17
00:00:31,798 --> 00:00:33,399
POLICE CARRY ON THEM. 

18
00:00:33,399 --> 00:00:34,200
IT WAS A CRACK, CRACK, CRACK 

19
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:35,501
LIKE FOUR IN A ROW. 

20
00:00:35,501 --> 00:00:38,371
AND I COULD HEAR IT REALLY 

21
00:00:38,371 --> 00:00:40,540
CLOSE BECAUSE I KNEW WHERE THEY 

22
00:00:40,540 --> 00:00:41,541
WERE LOCATED BECAUSE I HAD SEEN 

23
00:00:41,541 --> 00:00:44,243
THEM SHOW UP AT THE LOCATION. 

24
00:00:44,243 --> 00:00:46,980
BUT IT WAS A CRACK, CRACK, NOT 

25
00:00:46,980 --> 00:00:47,580
A BIG GUN. 

26
00:00:47,580 --> 00:00:49,082
I DON'T REALLY KNOW GUNS BUT IT 

27
00:00:49,082 --> 00:00:51,217
WAS A CRACK, CRACK. 

28
00:00:51,217 --> 00:00:53,786
>> AGAIN, WERE THEY IN RAPID 

29
00:00:53,786 --> 00:00:57,290
SUCCESSION OR AN EXCHANGE OF 

30
00:00:57,290 --> 00:01:00,093
FIRE BACK AND FORTH WITH A 

31
00:01:00,093 --> 00:01:00,326
DELAY. 

32
00:01:00,326 --> 00:01:02,062
>> THE ONCE I HEARD -- ONES I 

33
00:01:02,062 --> 00:01:02,628
HEARD WERE RAPID. 

34
00:01:02,628 --> 00:01:05,665
>> YOU ARE IN A CHILD CARE 

35
00:01:05,665 --> 00:01:05,899
CENTER. 

36
00:01:05,899 --> 00:01:07,333
WHAT HAVE YOU BEEN INSTRUCTED 

37
00:01:07,333 --> 00:01:08,934
TO DO AND WHAT ARE YOU DOING? 

38
00:01:08,934 --> 00:01:11,070
>> WE HAVE OUR CENTER ON 

39
00:01:11,070 --> 00:01:11,671
LOCKDOWN. 

40
00:01:11,671 --> 00:01:14,574
WE HAVE A FEW KIDS HERE. 

41
00:01:14,574 --> 00:01:16,776
WE HAVE ABOUT 23 KIDS IN OUR 

42
00:01:16,776 --> 00:01:17,777
CARE CURRENTLY THAT WERE 

43
00:01:17,777 --> 00:01:20,480
DROPPED OFF BEFORE WE WENT ON 

44
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:21,581
LOCKDOWN BECAUSE WE WERE 

45
00:01:21,581 --> 00:01:25,685
UNAWARE OF HOW SERIOUS THE 

46
00:01:25,685 --> 00:01:27,086
SITUATION WAS IN THE BEGINNING. 

47
00:01:27,086 --> 00:01:28,888
SO, WE ARE NOT HAVING ANYONE 

48
00:01:28,888 --> 00:01:30,323
COME IN OR LEAVE. 

49
00:01:30,323 --> 00:01:31,891
WE HAVE ALL THE DOORS LOCKED 

50
00:01:31,891 --> 00:01:36,362
AND ON TOP OF THAT, WE DO HAVE 

51
00:01:36,362 --> 00:01:36,762
SECURITY DOORS. 

52
00:01:36,762 --> 00:01:41,701
SO, WE HAVE TWO DOORS PROTECTED 

53
00:01:41,701 --> 00:01:42,001
RIGHT NOW. 

54
00:01:42,001 --> 00:01:44,003
SO, THAT'S WHAT WE ARE DOING. 

55
00:01:44,003 --> 00:01:45,872
THE REASON WHY WE DECIDED TO GO 

56
00:01:45,872 --> 00:01:48,575
ON LOCKDOWN AND HOW WE FOUND 

57
00:01:48,575 --> 00:01:50,777
OUT WAS I CALLED THE 

58
00:01:50,777 --> 00:01:52,278
NONEMERGENCY LINE HERE IN 

59
00:01:52,278 --> 00:01:54,180
FREDERICTON AND THE LADY WAS 

60
00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:56,683
VERY URGENT AND TOLD ME TO GO 

61
00:01:56,683 --> 00:01:57,850
ON LOCKDOWN. 

62
00:01:57,850 --> 00:01:58,117
SO, YEAH. 

63
00:01:58,117 --> 00:02:00,086
>> WE ARE TALKING ABOUT 

64
00:02:00,086 --> 00:02:03,890
CHILDREN UNDER THE AGE OF 5? 

65
00:02:03,890 --> 00:02:07,760
>> WE HAVE CHILDREN -- WE HAVE 

66
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:09,696
INFANTS, 2-YEAR-OLD, 3, 4-YEAR-

67
00:02:09,696 --> 00:02:12,165
OLD AND 5-YEAR-OLD AND 6-YEAR-

68
00:02:12,165 --> 00:02:14,367
OLD AND 7-YEAR-OLD HERE TODAY. 

69
00:02:14,367 --> 00:02:15,034
>> HOW ARE THEY DOING? 

70
00:02:15,034 --> 00:02:24,377
>> THEY HAVE NO IDEA, WHICH IS 

71
00:02:24,377 --> 00:02:24,577
GOOD. 

72
00:02:24,577 --> 00:02:26,912
THEY ARE WATCHING A MOVIE. 

73
00:02:26,912 --> 00:02:29,182
THEY THINK IT'S COOL TO HANG 

74
00:02:29,182 --> 00:02:30,149
OUT WITH THEIR SIBLINGS. 

75
00:02:30,149 --> 00:02:31,284
THEY DON'T KNOW OTHERWISE. 

76
00:02:31,284 --> 00:02:33,786
>> THEY ARE DOING FINE. 

77
00:02:33,786 --> 00:02:35,554
AS LONG AS THE MOVIE IS ON. 

78
00:02:35,554 --> 00:02:37,490
HOW ARE YOU DOING? 

79
00:02:37,490 --> 00:02:38,458
THIS MUST BE STRESSFUL? 

80
00:02:38,458 --> 00:02:40,926
>> BEING IN CHARGE, IT IS. 

81
00:02:40,926 --> 00:02:42,795
IT'S SCARY BECAUSE I FEEL 

82
00:02:42,795 --> 00:02:44,664
RESPONSIBLE FOR THESE CHILDREN 

83
00:02:44,664 --> 00:02:45,164
AND THE STAFF. 

84
00:02:45,164 --> 00:02:49,736
AND WE HAVE BEEN TALKING ABOUT 

85
00:02:49,736 --> 00:02:52,405
HOW IT'S FEELING LIKE THE 

86
00:02:52,405 --> 00:02:52,805
MONCTON SHOOTING. 

87
00:02:52,805 --> 00:02:54,674
I'M SURE YOU KNOW WHEN THAT 

88
00:02:54,674 --> 00:02:54,941
HAPPENED. 

89
00:02:54,941 --> 00:02:58,511
SO, THAT'S WHAT WE ARE FEELING 

90
00:02:58,511 --> 00:02:58,811
RIGHT NOW. 

91
00:02:58,811 --> 00:03:03,683
IT'S SCARY THAT IT'S IN OUR 

92
00:03:03,683 --> 00:03:04,650
HOME RIGHT DOWN THE STREET. 

93
00:03:04,650 --> 00:03:08,188
>> WE HAVE BEEN TRYING TO 

94
00:03:08,188 --> 00:03:09,389
DESCRIBE THE AREA ITSELF. 

95
00:03:09,389 --> 00:03:10,590
BROOKSIDE DRIVE, THE AREA THAT 

96
00:03:10,590 --> 00:03:12,325
IS STILL, AS WE UNDERSTAND IT, 

97
00:03:12,325 --> 00:03:13,860
UNDER THE POLICE LOCK DOWN IS 

98
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:15,194
MAIN STREET TO RING ROAD. 

99
00:03:15,194 --> 00:03:19,098
THAT IS A LONG AREA. 

100
00:03:19,098 --> 00:03:20,733
THE ACTIVITY BE LIKE AT, SAY, 

101
00:03:20,733 --> 00:03:23,803
7:30 OR 8:00 A.M. 

102
00:03:23,803 --> 00:03:26,338
YOUR TIME WHEN THIS STARTED? 

103
00:03:26,338 --> 00:03:31,511
>> WELL, AT THAT TIME, THAT 

104
00:03:31,511 --> 00:03:33,079
ROAD IS VERY HEAVILY POPULATED. 

105
00:03:33,079 --> 00:03:35,748
THERE IS A LOT OF HOMES AND 

106
00:03:35,748 --> 00:03:36,048
APARTMENTS. 

107
00:03:36,048 --> 00:03:38,484
AND I WAS OUT ON THE ROAD. 

108
00:03:38,484 --> 00:03:42,188
I WENT TO TIM MORE TONS. 

109
00:03:42,188 --> 00:03:43,389
EVERYONE WENT TO TIM HORTON 

110
00:03:43,389 --> 00:03:48,427
BECAUSE THERE IS ONE THERE. 

111
00:03:48,427 --> 00:03:49,195
THINGS ARE SLOWER LATELY 

112
00:03:49,195 --> 00:03:51,397
BECAUSE WE HAVE CONSTRUCTION ON 

113
00:03:51,397 --> 00:03:52,598
RING ROAD, THE HIGHWAY THAT 

114
00:03:52,598 --> 00:03:54,133
PEOPLE TAKE TO GET TO THE SOUTH 

115
00:03:54,133 --> 00:03:55,134
SIDE. 

116
00:03:55,134 --> 00:03:59,305
WE ARE ON THE NORTH SIDE. 

117
00:03:59,305 --> 00:04:00,106
ASSOCIATION IT'S BACKED UP. 

118
00:04:00,106 --> 00:04:01,507
SO, EVERYONE WAS HEADING TO 

119
00:04:01,507 --> 00:04:01,707
WORK. 

120
00:04:01,707 --> 00:04:04,110
THERE ARE PEOPLE WALKING TO 

121
00:04:04,110 --> 00:04:05,678
WORK AND BIKING TO WORK. 

122
00:04:05,678 --> 00:04:07,080
IT'S EVERYONE OUT AND ABOUT 

123
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:09,449
DOING THEIR THING, WALKING 

124
00:04:09,449 --> 00:04:14,120
THEIR DOGS LIKE A TYPICAL 

125
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:14,387
MORNING. 

126
00:04:14,387 --> 00:04:16,488
THAT IS HOW IT LOOKS WHEN I GO 

127
00:04:16,488 --> 00:04:16,988
TO WORK. 

128
00:04:16,988 --> 00:04:17,490
I LIVE IN THE AREA. 

129
00:04:17,490 --> 00:04:20,192
I DON'T THINK I WOULD BE ABLE 

130
00:04:20,192 --> 00:04:23,996
TO GET HOME RIGHT NOW BECAUSE 

131
00:04:23,996 --> 00:04:28,034
OF THE LOCK DOWN. 

132
00:04:28,034 --> 00:04:28,667
SO THAT'S INTERESTING. 

133
00:04:28,667 --> 00:04:30,536
>> YOU ARE THERE WITH A COUPLE 

134
00:04:30,536 --> 00:04:32,272
OF DOZEN KIDS UNDER THE AGE OF 

135
00:04:32,272 --> 00:04:33,806
7 WATCHING A MOVIE AND YOU HAVE 

136
00:04:33,806 --> 00:04:44,584
THE STRESS OF DEALING WITH THE 

137
00:04:44,584 --> 00:04:44,851
SIDEWALKS.

138
00:04:44,851 --> 00:04:46,285
-- DEALING WITH THE SITUATION. 

139
00:04:46,285 --> 00:04:48,454
>> WE HAD A LOT OF PARENTS CALL 

140
00:04:48,454 --> 00:04:50,590
AND CONCERNED WITH THE KIDS 

141
00:04:50,590 --> 00:04:51,190
THAT ARE HERE. 

142
00:04:51,190 --> 00:04:57,764
PARENTS THAT DROPPED OFF AND WE 

143
00:04:57,764 --> 00:04:59,999
HAVE ASSURED THEM THAT WE ARE 

144
00:04:59,999 --> 00:05:02,535
KEEPING THEM SAFE, THEY DON'T 

145
00:05:02,535 --> 00:05:03,001
KNOW ANYTHING. 

146
00:05:03,001 --> 00:05:05,270
FOR THE PARENTS THAT TRIED TO 

147
00:05:05,270 --> 00:05:10,476
DROP OFF WHEN WE WERE ON 

148
00:05:10,476 --> 00:05:11,911
LOCKDOWN, THEY DROVE HOME 

149
00:05:11,911 --> 00:05:13,512
BECAUSE THE AREA, THE FAMILIES 

150
00:05:13,512 --> 00:05:14,914
ALL LIVE IN THE BROOKSIDE DRIVE 

151
00:05:14,914 --> 00:05:15,114
AREA. 

152
00:05:15,114 --> 00:05:17,684
SO, WE HAVE A LOT OF PARENTS AT 

153
00:05:17,684 --> 00:05:18,717
HOME ON LOCKDOWN WITH THEIR 

154
00:05:18,717 --> 00:05:19,285
CHILDREN. 

155
00:05:19,285 --> 00:05:21,988
WE HAVE A LOT OF PARENTS THAT 

156
00:05:21,988 --> 00:05:23,489
ARE ACTUALLY DEALING WITH THE 

157
00:05:23,489 --> 00:05:27,093
SITUATION CURRENTLY BECAUSE WE 

158
00:05:27,093 --> 00:05:28,995
HAVE A LOT OF POLICE OFFICERS 

159
00:05:28,995 --> 00:05:29,395
AS PARENTS HERE. 

160
00:05:29,395 --> 00:05:33,433
SO, WE HAVE A FEW OF THEIR 

161
00:05:33,433 --> 00:05:33,666
KIDDOS. 

162
00:05:33,666 --> 00:05:35,568
SO, IT'S SCARY THAT WE ARE 

163
00:05:35,568 --> 00:05:37,103
AWARE OF SOME POLICE OFFICERS 

164
00:05:37,103 --> 00:05:37,804
THAT ARE DOWN. 

165
00:05:37,804 --> 00:05:43,176
SO, OUR HEARTS ARE KIND OF 

166
00:05:43,176 --> 00:05:46,078
THERE, TOO, I GUESS WITH THEM. 

167
00:05:46,078 --> 00:05:47,446
>> RACHEL, YOU ARE DOING GREAT. 

168
00:05:47,446 --> 00:05:49,882
YOU HAVE THE AND OF A LOT OF 

169
00:05:49,882 --> 00:05:51,050
LITTLE LIVES IN YOUR HANDS. 

170
00:05:51,050 --> 00:05:52,318
YOU ARE DOING A GREAT JOB. 

171
00:05:52,318 --> 00:05:55,188
THANK YOU FOR TELLING US WHAT 

172
00:05:55,188 --> 00:05:56,923
YOU KNOW ABOUT THIS AND 

173
00:05:56,923 --> 00:05:57,323
INFORMING PEOPLE. 

174
00:05:57,323 --> 00:05:59,559
WE HAVEN'T TOLD PEOPLE WHERE 

175
00:05:59,559 --> 00:06:01,394
YOU ARE OTHER THAN THAT YOU ARE 

176
00:06:01,394 --> 00:06:03,128
CARING FOR YOUNG PEOPLE. 

177
00:06:03,128 --> 00:06:04,597
WE ARE EMPHASIZING AGAIN POLICE 

178
00:06:04,597 --> 00:06:07,033
ARE SAYING THAT THEY WANT 

179
00:06:07,033 --> 00:06:09,001
PEOPLE TO BE CAREFUL ABOUT 

180
00:06:09,001 --> 00:06:10,736
POSTING ANYTHING ON SOCIAL 

181
00:06:10,736 --> 00:06:10,970
MEDIA. 

182
00:06:10,970 --> 00:06:13,806
DON'T BE TELLING PEOPLE WHERE 

183
00:06:13,806 --> 00:06:15,308
YOU ARE OR WHERE YOU ARE HIDING 

184
00:06:15,308 --> 00:06:17,877
BECAUSE IT IS CLEARLY AN 

185
00:06:17,877 --> 00:06:18,511

DIFFICULT SITUATION IN YOUR

00:06:51,811 --> 00:06:52,612
WHAT DO YOU KNOW? 

205

>> ABSOLUTELY, JOHN. 

206
00:06:53,112 --> 00:06:57,416
THERE IS A LOT OF CONCERN FOR

ACROSS -- DIRECTLY ACROSS RIVER 

211
00:07:07,093 --> 00:07:07,660
FROM DOWNTOWN FREDERICTON. 

212
00:07:07,660 --> 00:07:09,195
THIS IS NOT THE KIND OF 

213
00:07:09,195 --> 00:07:11,297
INCIDENT THIS COMMUNITY IS USED 

214
00:07:11,297 --> 00:07:11,497
TO. 

215
00:07:11,497 --> 00:07:13,633
PEOPLE ARE TRYING TO GET AS 

216
00:07:13,633 --> 00:07:14,300
MUCH INFORMATION AS POSSIBLE. 

217
00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:15,835
THE BOTTOM LINE IS, THERE IS A 

218
00:07:15,835 --> 00:07:18,004
LOT MORE WE DON'T KNOW, JOHN. 

219
00:07:18,004 --> 00:07:21,107
WE KNOW THAT THE POLICE HAVE 

220
00:07:21,107 --> 00:07:21,908
CONFIRMED FOUR FATALITIES. 

221
00:07:21,908 --> 00:07:23,609
WE DON'T KNOW THE CIRCUMSTANCES 

222
00:07:23,609 --> 00:07:25,778
OF THOSE DEATHS AT ALL YET, 

223
00:07:25,778 --> 00:07:28,447
ONLY THAT THEY TOOK PLACE IN 

224
00:07:28,447 --> 00:07:28,980
THE BROOKSIDE DRIVE AREA. 

225
00:07:28,980 --> 00:07:31,284
THERE IS A SHOPPING MALL THERE 

226
00:07:31,284 --> 00:07:32,919
AND A SMALL COMMUNITY PLAZA. 

227
00:07:32,919 --> 00:07:34,420
IT'S A BUSY PLACE THIS TIME OF 

228
00:07:34,420 --> 00:07:35,721
MORNINGBECAUSE PEOPLE ARE 

229
00:07:35,721 --> 00:07:37,523
TRYING TO GET TO WORK. 

230
00:07:37,523 --> 00:07:39,292
PERHAPS LESS BUSY GIVEN THAT 

231
00:07:39,292 --> 00:07:42,495
IT'S AUGUST AND A LOT OF PEOPLE 

232
00:07:42,495 --> 00:07:45,363
ARE ON VACATION. 

233
00:07:45,363 --> 00:07:46,666
NONETHELESS, THAT AREA, THAT 

234
00:07:46,666 --> 00:07:48,234
NEIGHBORHOOD HAS BEEN WARNED 

235
00:07:48,234 --> 00:07:49,669
THAT PEOPLE IN THEIR BUSINESSES 

236
00:07:49,669 --> 00:07:52,205
AND HOMES SHOULD STAY INSIDE, 

237
00:07:52,205 --> 00:07:53,739
LOCK THE DOORS AND HUNKER DOWN 

238
00:07:53,739 --> 00:07:56,108
FOR THE TIME BEING UNTIL WE GET 

239
00:07:56,108 --> 00:07:59,579
GREATER CLARITY ON WHAT IS 

240
00:07:59,579 --> 00:08:00,112
GOING ON HERE. 

241
00:08:00,112 --> 00:08:01,514
POLICE ARE DRESSED IN S.W.A.T. 

242
00:08:01,514 --> 00:08:03,216
GEAR SEEN IN THE STREET AND 

243
00:08:03,216 --> 00:08:07,386
BEYOND THAT, WE ARE WAITING FOR 

244
00:08:07,386 --> 00:08:08,921
INFORMATION LIKE EVERYONE ELSE. 

245
00:08:08,921 --> 00:08:10,155
>> FOUR PEOPLE KILLED. 

246
00:08:10,155 --> 00:08:10,623
>> YEAH. 

247
00:08:10,623 --> 00:08:12,725
>> HORRIFIC FOR ANY COMMUNITY. 

248
00:08:12,725 --> 00:08:15,328
WE ARE TRYING TO GET A 

249
00:08:15,328 --> 00:08:16,429
DESCRIPTION AND SENSE OF THE 

250
00:08:16,429 --> 00:08:18,463
AREA THIS TAKE PLACE IN. 

251
00:08:18,463 --> 00:08:20,766
IT NORMALLY WOULD BE BUSY AT 

252
00:08:20,766 --> 00:08:22,034
THIS TIME AND QUITE 

253
00:08:22,034 --> 00:08:22,367
RESIDENTIAL? 

254
00:08:22,367 --> 00:08:23,368
>> THAT'S RIGHT. 

255
00:08:23,368 --> 00:08:25,705
THERE IS A LARGE MALL, THE 

256
00:08:25,705 --> 00:08:28,107
BROOKSIDE MALL AS WELL AS A 

257
00:08:28,107 --> 00:08:34,914
SMALLER MALL DOWN THE STREET 

258
00:08:34,914 --> 00:08:39,952
THAT HAS A TIM HORTON'S. 

259
00:08:39,952 --> 00:08:40,452
HEAVILY POPULATED WITH 

260
00:08:40,452 --> 00:08:41,986
RESIDENTIAL HOUSING. 

261
00:08:41,986 --> 00:08:43,422
NOT THE SORT OF NEIGHBORHOOD 

262
00:08:43,422 --> 00:08:49,795
THAT YOU WOULD EXPECT THIS KIND 

263
00:08:49,795 --> 00:08:50,095
OF THING. 

264
00:08:50,095 --> 00:08:51,898
AT THIS TIME OF DAY MOST PEOPLE 

265
00:08:51,898 --> 00:08:53,566
WOULD BE GETTING READY TO GO TO 

266
00:08:53,566 --> 00:08:56,569
WORK AND GET IN THEIR CARS AND 

267
00:08:56,569 --> 00:08:58,003
BEGIN THE SHORT TREK TO THEIR 

268
00:08:58,003 --> 00:08:59,905
JOBS AND PEOPLE MAY NOT BE ABLE 

269
00:08:59,905 --> 00:09:01,206
TO DO THAT THIS MORNING BECAUSE 

270
00:09:01,206 --> 00:09:04,510
THEY HAVE BEEN TOLD BY THE 

271
00:09:04,510 --> 00:09:06,646
POLICE TO STAY INSIDE THEIR 

272
00:09:06,646 --> 00:09:09,548
HOMES AND AWAIT FURTHER NOTICE. 

273
00:09:09,548 --> 00:09:11,183
WE HAVE JUST APPROACHING THE 

274
00:09:11,183 --> 00:09:13,119
BRIDGE TO THE NORTH SIDE NOW. 

275
00:09:13,119 --> 00:09:13,986
WHERE THERE WOULD NORMALLY BE 

276
00:09:13,986 --> 00:09:16,722
TRAFFIC AT THIS TIME OF THE 

277
00:09:16,722 --> 00:09:20,192
DAY, THE BRIDGE IS PRETTY WELL 

278
00:09:20,192 --> 00:09:20,425
EMPTY. 

279
00:09:20,425 --> 00:09:22,994
AS WE GET CLOSER, I'M SURE WE 

280
00:09:22,994 --> 00:09:26,131
WILL FIND A HEAVIER AND HEAVIER 

281
00:09:26,131 --> 00:09:26,699
POLICE PRESENCE. 

282
00:09:26,699 --> 00:09:28,568
ONE OF MY COLLEAGUES WAS SAYING 

283
00:09:28,568 --> 00:09:31,404
THAT HE NOTICED A HEAVY POLICE 

284
00:09:31,404 --> 00:09:33,806
PRESENCE THIS MORNING JUST 

285
00:09:33,806 --> 00:09:37,009
AFTER 8:00 WHEN THIS IS 

286
00:09:37,009 --> 00:09:37,876
BELIEVED TO HAVE HAPPENED. 

287
00:09:37,876 --> 00:09:40,712
POLICE ARE SEARCHING THROUGH 

288
00:09:40,712 --> 00:09:42,981
THE NEIGHBORHOOD. 

289
00:09:42,981 --> 00:09:48,087
IT'S BELIEVED DEALER SEARCHING 

290
00:09:48,087 --> 00:09:48,520
FOR AN INDIVIDUAL. 

291
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:49,688
WE DON'T KNOW WHAT IS BEHIND 

292
00:09:49,688 --> 00:09:51,924
THIS, THE NATURE OF THE 

293
00:09:51,924 --> 00:09:53,426
FATALITIES, IF THEY INVOLVE 

294
00:09:53,426 --> 00:09:54,627
EMERGENCY PERSONNEL OR NOT. 

295
00:09:54,627 --> 00:09:55,695
WHAT WILL BE RUNNING THROUGH 

296
00:09:55,695 --> 00:09:59,599
THE MINDS OF MOST PEOPLE IS THE 

297
00:09:59,599 --> 00:10:01,267
TERRIBLE SITUATION THAT 

298
00:10:01,267 --> 00:10:04,270
OCCURRED IN MONKTON, ONE OF THE 

299
00:10:04,270 --> 00:10:08,541
OTHER THREE MAJOR CITIES IN NEW 

300
00:10:08,541 --> 00:10:10,309
BRUNSWICK IN 2014 WHEN OFFICERS 

301
00:10:10,309 --> 00:10:11,510
WERE FATALITIES IN A DIRE 

302
00:10:11,510 --> 00:10:11,910
SITUATION THERE. 

303
00:10:11,910 --> 00:10:14,613
THERE WILL BE A LOT OF CONCERN. 

304
00:10:14,613 --> 00:10:17,450
THAT WILL BE FOREMOST IN 

305
00:10:17,450 --> 00:10:23,322
PEOPLE'S MINDS AS THEY RESPOND 

306
00:10:23,322 --> 00:10:24,323
TO THE POLICE DEPARTMENT AND 

307
00:10:24,323 --> 00:10:27,026
URGING TO STAY INSIDE AND STAY 

308
00:10:27,026 --> 00:10:29,228
AWAY FROM BROOKSIDE. 

309
00:10:29,228 --> 00:10:30,730
>> YOU SAID THE MONKTON 

310
00:10:30,730 --> 00:10:32,031
INCIDENT AND WE TALKED TO 

311
00:10:32,031 --> 00:10:33,733
WITNESSES RECALLING THAT AND 

312
00:10:33,733 --> 00:10:35,468
DEEP CONCERN ABOUT WHAT IS 

313
00:10:35,468 --> 00:10:36,669
UNFOLDING WHERE YOU ARE. 

314
00:10:36,669 --> 00:10:38,738
WE DO NOT KNOW THE IDENTITIES 

315
00:10:38,738 --> 00:10:40,105
OF THOSE FOUR PEOPLE KILLED. 

316
00:10:40,105 --> 00:10:49,248
WE HAVE TO FAME SIZE THAT AT 

317
00:10:49,248 --> 00:10:50,048
THIS POINT. 

318
00:10:50,048 --> 00:10:55,688
THERE IS AN E TF HERE, 

319
00:10:55,688 --> 00:10:56,121
EMERGENCY S.W.A.T. 

320
00:10:56,121 --> 00:10:56,355
TEAMS. 

321
00:10:56,355 --> 00:10:56,955
RCNP IS NOT THE POLICE FORCE 

322
00:10:56,955 --> 00:11:02,328
FOR THE CITY BUT A PRESENCE IN 

323
00:11:02,328 --> 00:11:03,028
THE AREA. 

324
00:11:03,028 --> 00:11:03,729
>> ABSOLUTELY. 

325
00:11:03,729 --> 00:11:06,365
THE RCNP ARE THE MUNICIPAL 

326
00:11:06,365 --> 00:11:10,770
POLICE FORCE FOR MANY SMALLER 

327
00:11:10,770 --> 00:11:12,237
COMMUNITIES IN NEW BRUNSWICK. 

328
00:11:12,237 --> 00:11:17,076
THEY WORK WITH THE LARGER 

329
00:11:17,076 --> 00:11:26,385
MUNICIPAL POLICE FORCES IN ST. 

330
00:11:26,385 --> 00:11:30,022
JOHN AND OTHER COMMUNITIES.

331
00:11:30,022 --> 00:11:32,958
YOU CAN BET THEY ARE CON FIRING 

332
00:11:32,958 --> 00:11:34,126
WITH COLLEAGUES WHAT IS -- 

333
00:11:34,126 --> 00:11:34,826
CONFERRING WITH COLLEAGUES WHAT 

334
00:11:34,826 --> 00:11:37,129
IS NEEDED AND WHAT THEY CAN DO 

335
00:11:37,129 --> 00:11:38,264
TO HELP. 

336
00:11:38,264 --> 00:11:39,531
THE MOST DIFFICULT THING IS 

337
00:11:39,531 --> 00:11:41,433
GETTING CLARITY ON WHAT HAS 

338
00:11:41,433 --> 00:11:45,137
HAPPENED HERE TO RESULT IN THE 

339
00:11:45,137 --> 00:11:47,573
FOUR FATALITIES THAT WE ARE 

340
00:11:47,573 --> 00:11:48,473
TALKING ABOUT. 

341
00:11:48,473 --> 00:11:50,743
AND PEOPLE IN THE NORTH SIDE OF 

342
00:11:50,743 --> 00:11:52,044
FREDERICTON WILL BE ANXIOUS TO 

343
00:11:52,044 --> 00:11:53,712
UNDERSTAND WHAT WILL BE GOING 

344
00:11:53,712 --> 00:11:58,150
ON AND WHEN THEY WILL BE SAFE 

345
00:11:58,150 --> 00:11:59,484
TO LEAVE THEIR HOMES. 

346
00:11:59,484 --> 00:12:05,324
ON BROOKSIDE DRIVE, THE 

347
00:12:05,324 --> 00:12:07,726

00:12:07,726 --> 00:12:09,862
SUBDIVISIONS, THERE ARE

CONDOMINIUM BUILDINGS AND 

350
00:12:10,930 --> 00:12:12,698
PEOPLE WILL BE HUNKERED DOWN IN 

351
00:12:12,698 --> 00:12:15,067
THEIR HOMES UNTIL THEY GET THE 

352
00:12:15,067 --> 00:12:16,702
ALL CLEAR FROM THE POLICE. 

353
00:12:16,702 --> 00:12:18,137
>> HARRY, THANK YOU SO MUCH. 

354
00:12:18,137 --> 00:12:20,172

IN WHAT SEEMS TO BE MOSTLY A 

386
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:16,128
RESIDENTIAL AREA TO STAY IN 

387
00:13:16,128 --> 00:13:16,461
THEIR HOMES. 

388
00:13:16,461 --> 00:13:18,631
THEY ARE ASKING EVERYONE ELSE 

389
00:13:18,631 --> 00:13:20,466
TO AVOID THE AREA. 

390
00:13:20,466 --> 00:13:23,502
THIS IS STILL AN ACTIVE 

391
00:13:23,502 --> 00:13:23,802
SITUATION. 

392
00:13:23,802 --> 00:13:25,604
THEY HAVE BROUGHT IN AN ARMORED

THEY ARE WALKING PEOPLE OUT OF 

403
00:13:40,552 --> 00:13:40,819

THEY DO 0 NOT WANT -- THEY DO 

413
00:13:57,769 --> 00:14:01,807

414
00:14:01,807 --> 00:14:04,443
DISSEMINATED IN THE PUBLIC 

415
00:14:04,443 --> 00:14:04,843
OFFICER. 

416
00:14:04,843 --> 00:14:06,111
PAUL VIOLLIS IS STANDING BY. 

417
00:14:06,111 --> 00:14:07,512
YOU ARE A SECURITY ANALYST. 

418
00:14:07,512 --> 00:14:09,448
SOME PEOPLE ARE BEING ALLOWED 

419
00:14:09,448 --> 00:14:10,416
TO LEAVE THE AREA. 

420
00:14:10,416 --> 00:14:11,450
POLICE ARE ESCORTING THEM OUT. 

421
00:14:11,450 --> 00:14:13,319
THEY HAVE A S.W.A.T. 

422
00:14:13,319 --> 00:14:15,254
TEAM THERE, AN ARMORED VEHICLE 

423
00:14:15,254 --> 00:14:16,956
THERE, WHAT CAN YOU SORT OF 

424
00:14:16,956 --> 00:14:18,123
GIVE ME BASED ON THE 

425
00:14:18,123 --> 00:14:20,459
INFORMATION THAT WE KNOW SO FAR 

426
00:14:20,459 --> 00:14:22,127
ABOUT HOW THINGS ARE UNFOLDING. 

427
00:14:22,127 --> 00:14:24,964
>> BASED AGAIN ON THE GREAT 

428
00:14:24,964 --> 00:14:26,498
FOOTAGE WE ARE GETTING FROM 

429
00:14:26,498 --> 00:14:28,767
CBSN ONLINE SHOWING THE PICTURE 

430
00:14:28,767 --> 00:14:31,070
OF THE SCENE RIGHT NOW, CLEARLY 

431
00:14:31,070 --> 00:14:33,639
THEY HAVE AN OUTER PERIMETER 

432
00:14:33,639 --> 00:14:34,139
AND INNER PERIMETER. 

433
00:14:34,139 --> 00:14:38,677
THEY ARE REMOVING PEOPLE FROM 

434
00:14:38,677 --> 00:14:39,578
THEIR HOMES WHICH MEANS THAT 

435
00:14:39,578 --> 00:14:42,948
THEY HAVE NARROWED DOWN WHERE A 

436
00:14:42,948 --> 00:14:45,016
SHOOTER IS OR SHOOTERS. 

437
00:14:45,016 --> 00:14:48,554
IF NOT HAVE ALREADY MITIGATED 

438
00:14:48,554 --> 00:14:48,954
THE RISK. 

439
00:14:48,954 --> 00:14:50,022
NOW THEY CLEARLY UNDERSTAND 

440
00:14:50,022 --> 00:14:52,658
WHAT IS A DANGER ZONE AND WHAT 

441
00:14:52,658 --> 00:14:54,492
IS OUTSIDE THE DANGER ZONE. 

442
00:14:54,492 --> 00:14:59,531
OUTSIDE THE DANGER ZONE, THEY 

443
00:14:59,531 --> 00:14:59,931
WILL EVACUATE. 

444
00:14:59,931 --> 00:15:01,400
ALL OF THESE ARE ARE GOOD SIGNS 

445
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:02,468
FOR THE GENERAL PUCK LIKE. 

446
00:15:02,468 --> 00:15:06,138
THAT IS TELLING US THAT LAW 

447
00:15:06,138 --> 00:15:08,407
ENFORCEMENT HAS GUN TO CONTAIN 

448
00:15:08,407 --> 00:15:10,843
IF NOT ALREADY CONTAINED THE 

449
00:15:10,843 --> 00:15:12,010
SITUATION AND THEY ARE 

450
00:15:12,010 --> 00:15:13,211
BEGINNING TO CLEANSE IT. 

451
00:15:13,211 --> 00:15:14,613
>> THAT IS GOOD NEWS. 

452
00:15:14,613 --> 00:15:16,749
WE REALLY DON'T KNOW WHAT IS 

453
00:15:16,749 --> 00:15:17,149
GOING ON HERE. 

454
00:15:17,149 --> 00:15:19,752
WE DON'T KNOW IF THIS IS SIMPLY 

455
00:15:19,752 --> 00:15:21,120
A DOMESTIC SITUATION BECAUSE 

456
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:23,622
IT'S IN A RESIDENTIAL AREA OR 

457
00:15:23,622 --> 00:15:25,690
IF IT HAS LARGER, BROADER 

458
00:15:25,690 --> 00:15:26,024
IMPLICATIONS. 

459
00:15:26,024 --> 00:15:28,360
YOU DON'T WANT TO TAKE ANY 

460
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:28,627
CHANCES. 

461
00:15:28,627 --> 00:15:30,362
WE REMEMBER IN TORONTO NOT TOO 

462
00:15:30,362 --> 00:15:34,266
LONG AGO THERE WAS A MASS 

463
00:15:34,266 --> 00:15:35,834
SHOOTING THERE. 

464
00:15:35,834 --> 00:15:42,041
A SINGLE SHOOTING IN THE 

465
00:15:42,041 --> 00:15:44,710
DANFORTH AREA RANDOMLY SHOOTING 

466
00:15:44,710 --> 00:15:45,077
PEOPLE. 

467
00:15:45,077 --> 00:15:46,111
THE FAMILY SAID IT HAD NOTHING 

468
00:15:46,111 --> 00:15:48,813
TO DO WITH A TERRORIST ATTACK. 

469
00:15:48,813 --> 00:15:49,982
HE WAS SEVERELY ILL. 

470
00:15:49,982 --> 00:15:51,283
WHEN WE SEE THESE MASS 

471
00:15:51,283 --> 00:15:52,751
SHOOTINGS WE WANT TO PAY 

472
00:15:52,751 --> 00:15:53,585
PARTICULAR ATTENTION TO IT 

473
00:15:53,585 --> 00:15:55,554
BECAUSE WE DON'T KNOW HOW 

474
00:15:55,554 --> 00:15:56,021
THINGS WILL UNFOLD. 

475
00:15:56,021 --> 00:15:59,191
PAUL, I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR 

476
00:15:59,191 --> 00:16:00,459
YOUR INPUT AND EXPERTISE. 

477
00:16:00,459 --> 00:16:03,095
YOU ARE ALWAYS HERE WHEN WE 

478
00:16:03,095 --> 00:16:03,362
NEED IT. 

479
00:16:03,362 --> 00:16:05,064
FOR EVERYONE ELSE WE WILL DIP 

480
00:16:05,064 --> 00:16:17,109
BACK IN TO THE LOCAL CBC 

481
00:16:17,109 --> 00:16:22,081
COVERAGE CAN YOU TALK ABOUT THE 

482
00:16:22,081 --> 00:16:23,649
NEIGHBORHOOD, THIS LONG STRETCH 

483
00:16:23,649 --> 00:16:24,016
OF BROOKSIDE. 

484
00:16:24,016 --> 00:16:29,555
>> THE AREA THAT WE ARE IN IS A 

485
00:16:29,555 --> 00:16:30,188
RESIDENTIAL NEIGHBORHOOD. 

486
00:16:30,188 --> 00:16:34,960
THERE ARE LOTS OF HOMES WITH 

487
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:35,526
ATTACHED GARAGES. 

488
00:16:35,526 --> 00:16:36,962
THERE ARE APARTMENT BUILDINGS. 

489
00:16:36,962 --> 00:16:39,130
IT LOOKED LIKE A FAMILY 

490
00:16:39,130 --> 00:16:40,832
ORIENTED AREA IN FREDERICTON. 

491
00:16:40,832 --> 00:16:42,501
>> SO, AN AREA WHERE AT THAT 

492
00:16:42,501 --> 00:16:44,103
HOUR, AGAIN, EARLY IN THE 

493
00:16:44,103 --> 00:16:45,604
MORNING, YOU WOULD HAVE PEOPLE 

494
00:16:45,604 --> 00:16:47,373
HEADING TO WORK, SENDING KIDS 

495
00:16:47,373 --> 00:16:49,541
TO SCHOOL AND GOING FOR COFFEE, 

496
00:16:49,541 --> 00:16:49,808
RIGHT? 

497
00:16:49,808 --> 00:16:50,976
>> YEAH, I MEAN, THIS IS AN 

498
00:16:50,976 --> 00:16:55,781
AREA WHERE PEOPLE WOULD HAVE 

499
00:16:55,781 --> 00:16:57,549
BEEN GOING ABOUT THEIR REGULAR 

500
00:16:57,549 --> 00:16:57,749
DAY. 

501
00:16:57,749 --> 00:16:58,450
THAT CHANGED SUDDENLY THIS 

502
00:16:58,450 --> 00:16:59,184
MORNING. 

503
00:16:59,184 --> 00:17:00,485
>> CAN YOU GIVE US A SENSE -- 

504
00:17:00,485 --> 00:17:01,787
WE CAN'T BE SPECIFIC ABOUT 

505
00:17:01,787 --> 00:17:03,388
POLICE AND WHERE THEY ARE OR 

506
00:17:03,388 --> 00:17:05,656
WHAT THEY ARE DOING, BUT THIS 

507
00:17:05,656 --> 00:17:09,060
WOULD OBVIOUSY BE A FULL COURT 

508
00:17:09,060 --> 00:17:10,061
PRESS FOR THE POLICE IN 

509
00:17:10,061 --> 00:17:12,964
FREDERICTON AND IN A POSITION 

510
00:17:12,964 --> 00:17:14,800
TO BRING IN THE RCNP IN THE 

511
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:15,300
INVESTIGATION AS WELL. 

512
00:17:15,300 --> 00:17:16,568
CAN YOU TALK ABOUT WHAT ASSETS 

513
00:17:16,568 --> 00:17:19,170
ARE THERE ON THE GROUND IN 

514
00:17:19,170 --> 00:17:20,538
TERMS OF POLICE PRESENCE? 

515
00:17:20,538 --> 00:17:24,175
>> THERE IS A LARGE POLICE 

516
00:17:24,175 --> 00:17:24,776
PRESENCE. 

517
00:17:24,776 --> 00:17:26,979
WHILE I CAN'T SPEAK TO THE 

518
00:17:26,979 --> 00:17:28,380
SPECIFICS OF WHERE THEY ARE AND 

519
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:31,216
WHAT THEY HAVE, THERE IS A 

520
00:17:31,216 --> 00:17:33,685
LARGE POLICE PRESENCE ON SCENE 

521
00:17:33,685 --> 00:17:34,920
AS WELL AS FIRE DEPARTMENTS. 

522
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:37,055
THERE WAS AN AMBULANCE HERE BUT 

523
00:17:37,055 --> 00:17:39,124
IT HAS SINCE LEFT THE SCENE. 

524
00:17:39,124 --> 00:17:41,526
BUT OTHER THAN THAT, IT'S A 

525
00:17:41,526 --> 00:17:42,226
VERY LARGE POLICE PRESENCE. 

526
00:17:42,226 --> 00:17:44,063
>> AND WE HAVE BEEN LOOKING AT 

527
00:17:44,063 --> 00:17:45,464
VIDEO THAT YOU SENT IN WITH THE 

528
00:17:45,464 --> 00:17:56,175
FIRE TRUCK THERE AND AMBULANCE 

529
00:17:56,175 --> 00:17:56,475
AS WELL. 

530
00:17:56,475 --> 00:18:01,146
>> NATALIE, THANK YOU FOR YOUR 

531
00:18:01,146 --> 00:18:01,813
REPORTING. 

532
00:18:01,813 --> 00:18:02,413
ELIZABETH HAMPTON LIVES NEAR 

533
00:18:02,413 --> 00:18:04,349
THE SCENE. 

534
00:18:04,349 --> 00:18:08,487
THIS IS WHAT SHE HAD TO SAY. 

535
00:18:08,487 --> 00:18:09,521
I THOUGHT I HEARD FOUR. 

536
00:18:09,521 --> 00:18:11,390
I THOUGHT THESE WOULD HAVE BEEN 

537
00:18:11,390 --> 00:18:15,093
THE ONES I HEARD ABOUT 20 AFTER 

538
00:18:15,093 --> 00:18:15,394
8:00. 

539
00:18:15,394 --> 00:18:16,895
I THOUGHT THEY SOUNDED LIKE 

540
00:18:16,895 --> 00:18:17,863
POLICE CARS THAN ANYTHING ELSE. 

541
00:18:17,863 --> 00:18:20,632
THE ONLY KIND OF SHOTS I'M USED 

542
00:18:20,632 --> 00:18:22,301
TO HEARING IN THIS NEIGHBORHOOD 

543
00:18:22,301 --> 00:18:23,602
ARE DURING HUNTING SEASON. 

544
00:18:23,602 --> 00:18:24,770
THAT'S THE ONLY THING I COULD 

545
00:18:24,770 --> 00:18:25,704
COMPARE THEM WITH AND THEY 

546
00:18:25,704 --> 00:18:29,575
DIDN'T SOUND LIKE THAT. 

547
00:18:29,575 --> 00:18:32,678
>> YOU ARE SAYING IT WAS RATHER 

548
00:18:32,678 --> 00:18:39,685
NOT A BOOM LIKE A SHOTGUN BUT A 

549
00:18:39,685 --> 00:18:40,018
CRACK CRACK. 

550
00:18:40,018 --> 00:18:40,485
>> NOT RAPID. 

551
00:18:40,485 --> 00:18:41,753
A TIME BETWEEN THEM. 

552
00:18:41,753 --> 00:18:44,089
>> LIKE THEY WERE COMING FROM 

553
00:18:44,089 --> 00:18:44,456

742
00:25:14,713 --> 00:25:16,414
THE IDEA THAT THIS AREA STILL

US, WHAT DID YOU HEAR? 

883
00:29:28,866 --> 00:29:30,869
>> AROUND 7:00 THIS MORNING I 

884
00:29:30,869 --> 00:29:33,438
HEARD WHAT I THOUGHT WERE 

885
00:29:33,438 --> 00:29:33,971
FIRECRACKERS INITIALLY. 

886
00:29:33,971 --> 00:29:35,640
LIKE A BANG, FOLLOWED BY A 

887
00:29:35,640 --> 00:29:39,978
BANG, BANG, BANG AND RAPID FIRE 

888
00:29:39,978 --> 00:29:41,579
THEN ANOTHER BANG. 

889
00:29:41,579 --> 00:29:43,848
I THOUGHT IT WAS A PECULIARIZE 

890
00:29:43,848 --> 00:29:46,016
QUEENS, THEN A FEW MOMENTS 

891
00:29:46,016 --> 00:29:47,352
úLAT 

892
00:29:47,352 --> 00:29:49,687
FIGURE OUT WHAT IT WAS THAT I 

893
00:29:49,687 --> 00:29:52,724
WAS HEARING AND I HEARD IT 

894
00:29:52,724 --> 00:29:53,357
AGAIN, MUCH LOUDER. 

895
00:29:53,357 --> 00:29:57,795
I CONCLUDED IT WAS GUNSHOTS BUT 

896
00:29:57,795 --> 00:30:00,464
I WASN'T SURE AT THAT POINT. 

897
00:30:00,464 --> 00:30:02,967
>> SO, THE SITUATION YOU ARE 

898
00:30:02,967 --> 00:30:04,269
TALKING ABOUT HERE, ANYWAY YOU 

899
00:30:04,269 --> 00:30:06,838
COULD COUNT OR QUALIFY THE 

900
00:30:06,838 --> 00:30:09,874
NUMBER OF SHOTS THAT YOU HEARD? 

901
00:30:09,874 --> 00:30:15,446
WELL, IN TOTAL, MAYBE OVER A 15-

902
00:30:15,446 --> 00:30:17,414
MINUTE PERIOD I WOULD ESTIMATE 

903
00:30:17,414 --> 00:30:17,681
LIKE 15. 

904
00:30:17,681 --> 00:30:19,550
THEN ROUGHLY -- THEY ALL 

905
00:30:19,550 --> 00:30:22,253
SOUNDED THE SAME, LIKE THE SAME 

906
00:30:22,253 --> 00:30:24,155
FREQUENCY, SAME SORT OF SOUND. 

907
00:30:24,155 --> 00:30:26,658
THEN ROUGHLY 20 MINUTES LATER I 

908
00:30:26,658 --> 00:30:31,262
HEARD A LOUD SOUND THAT HAD A 

909
00:30:31,262 --> 00:30:32,463
MUCH DIFFERENT PITCH. 

910
00:30:32,463 --> 00:30:33,330
I THOUGHT IT WATTS A RIFLE BUT 

911
00:30:33,330 --> 00:30:35,166
I DON'T KNOW -- WAS A RIFLE BUT 

912
00:30:35,166 --> 00:30:35,666
I DON'T KNOW. 

913
00:30:35,666 --> 00:30:37,368
>> WAS THERE A SENSE THAT IT 

914
00:30:37,368 --> 00:30:40,838
WAS A BACK ANT FORTH OR A 

915
00:30:40,838 --> 00:30:43,308
SINGLE INDIVIDUAL SHOOTING IN A 

916
00:30:43,308 --> 00:30:43,975
PARTICULAR DIRECTION? 

917
00:30:43,975 --> 00:30:46,244
>> I REALLY DON'T KNOW. 

918
00:30:46,244 --> 00:30:49,147
ALL I COULD HEAR WAS THE 

919
00:30:49,147 --> 00:30:50,348

UNAWARE OF HOW SERIOUS THE 

1295
00:42:44,928 --> 00:42:46,129
SITUATION WAS IN THE BEGINNING. 

1296
00:42:46,129 --> 00:42:47,931

THEY THINK IT'S COOL TO HANG 

1306
00:43:10,220 --> 00:43:12,989

1307
00:43:12,989 --> 00:43:13,423
THEY ARE HAPPY. 

1308
00:43:13,423 --> 00:43:15,893

FIRED AND ONE IN CUSTODY -- ONE 

1395
00:46:12,502 --> 00:46:12,935
SUSPECT IN CUSTODY. 

1396
00:46:12,935 --> 00:46:14,671
LET'S HEAR FROM ONE OF THE 

1397
00:46:14,671 --> 00:46:19,877
WITNESSES ABOUT EXACTLY WHAT 

1398
00:46:19,877 --> 00:46:20,643
THEY HEARD THIS MORNING. 

1399
00:46:20,643 --> 00:46:23,980
AROUND 7:00 I HEARD WHAT I 

1400
00:46:23,980 --> 00:46:24,781
THOUGHT WERE FIRECRACKERS 

1401
00:46:24,781 --> 00:46:25,682
INITIALLY. 

1402
00:46:25,682 --> 00:46:27,584
A BANG FOLLOWED BY A BANG, 

1403
00:46:27,584 --> 00:46:29,286
BANG, BANG, THEN RAPID FIRE 

1404
00:46:29,286 --> 00:46:31,421
THEN ANOTHER BANG. 

1405
00:46:31,421 --> 00:46:33,757
I THOUGHT IT WAS A PECULIARIZE 

1406
00:46:33,757 --> 00:46:34,391
QUEENS. 

1407
00:46:34,391 --> 00:46:36,493
A FEW MINUTES LATER I STEPPED 

1408
00:46:36,493 --> 00:46:38,195
OUTSIDE TO MAKE SURE, TRYING TO 

1409
00:46:38,195 --> 00:46:40,363
FIGURE OUT WHAT I WAS HEARING. 

1410
00:46:40,363 --> 00:46:43,566
I HEARD IT AGAIN BUT LOUDER. 

1411
00:46:43,566 --> 00:46:45,035
IT SOUNDED THE SAME. 

1412
00:46:45,035 --> 00:46:47,104
THE SAME FREQUENCY, SAME SORT 

1413
00:46:47,104 --> 00:46:47,571
OF SOUND. 

1414
00:46:47,571 --> 00:46:49,773
THEN ROUGHLY 20 MINUTES LATER I 

1415
00:46:49,773 --> 00:46:53,677
HEARD A LOUD SOUND THAT HAD A 

1416
00:46:53,677 --> 00:46:55,012
MUCH DIFFERENT PITCH TO IT. 

1417
00:46:55,012 --> 00:47:04,187
I THOUGHT IT WAS A RIFLE BUT I 

1418
00:47:04,187 --> 00:47:04,487
DON'T KNOW. 

1419
00:47:04,487 --> 00:47:05,188
>> AROUND 7:00 A.M. 

1420
00:47:05,188 --> 00:47:08,125
LOCAL TIME THEY HEARD SHOTS 

1421
00:47:08,125 --> 00:47:08,358
FIRED. 

1422
00:47:08,358 --> 00:47:09,593
WITNESSES WERE HEARING SHOTS 

1423
00:47:09,593 --> 00:47:10,794
FIRED THROUGHOUT 7:00 TO 8:00 

1424
00:47:10,794 --> 00:47:11,194
A.M. 

1425
00:47:11,194 --> 00:47:13,763
SO, THERE COULD BE A PERIOD 

1426
00:47:13,763 --> 00:47:15,332
THERE, A TIME -- CHUNK OF TIME 

1427
00:47:15,332 --> 00:47:17,100
WHEN THERE WERE SHOTS BEING 

1428
00:47:17,100 --> 00:47:17,333
FIRED. 

1429
00:47:17,333 --> 00:47:23,206
WE DON'T KNOW WHERE OR WHO WAS 

1430
00:47:23,206 --> 00:47:23,606
FIRING THE SHOTS. 

1431
00:47:23,606 --> 00:47:26,009
WE KNOW A COUPLE OF HOURS 

1432
00:47:26,009 --> 00:47:27,144
LATER, 2 1/2 HOURS, IS THAT 

1433

00:47:28,879 --> 00:47:29,746
CUSTODY. 

1435
00:47:29,746 --> 00:47:31,114
THIS IS AN ACTIVE SCENE. 

1436
00:47:31,114 --> 00:47:32,082
IT'S WORTH MENTIONING AGAIN AND 

1437
00:47:32,082 --> 00:47:34,418
AGAIN AND AGAIN AS WE GET 

1438
00:47:34,418 --> 00:47:35,686

THIS IS STILL AN ACTIVE SCENE. 

1445
00:47:44,527 --> 00:47:46,662
THERE IS POLICE WORK GOING ON. 

1446
00:47:46,662 --> 00:47:51,735
THEY DON'T WANT ANY OF THEIR 

1447
00:47:51,735 --> 00:47:52,401
ACTIVITIES TO BE REVEALED. 

1448
00:47:52,401 --> 00:47:52,903

SOCIAL MEDIA THAT WOULD 

1452
00:47:56,506 --> 00:47:57,207
INDICATE WHERE THE POLICE ARE.

WARNING PEOPLE ABOUT. 

1455
00:47:59,843 --> 00:48:01,611
THEY SHOULD BE ABLE TO DO THEIR 

1456
00:48:01,611 --> 00:48:04,748
JOBS WITHOUT INDIVIDUALS THEY 

1457
00:48:04,748 --> 00:48:11,588
ARE LOOKING FOR KNOWING WHERE 

1458
00:48:11,588 --> 00:48:12,222
