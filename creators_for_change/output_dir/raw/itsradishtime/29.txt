00:00:00,130 --> 00:00:02,920
Hi friends,
How many days do you have left?

2
00:00:02,920 --> 00:00:07,230
Say there was a ticking clock on your life
where at the end of it, you could lose your

3
00:00:07,230 --> 00:00:12,590
driver’s license, your job, your enrollment
in school, your home, your family.

4
00:00:12,590 --> 00:00:14,820
All of it goes away when the clock hits zero.

5
00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:17,109
How many days would you have left.

6
00:00:17,109 --> 00:00:18,539
400?

7
00:00:18,539 --> 00:00:19,980
100?

8
00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:21,410
30?

9
00:00:21,410 --> 00:00:22,849
None?

10
00:00:22,849 --> 00:00:27,839
For some of you watching this, for DACA recipients,
this isn’t an imaginary scenario.

11
00:00:27,839 --> 00:00:28,839
This is your life.

12
00:00:28,839 --> 00:00:30,939
For the rest of you, listen up.

13
00:00:30,939 --> 00:00:35,870
Immigrant youth in the United States are part
of our communities and part of our country,

14
00:00:35,870 --> 00:00:38,300
and right now they’re under attack.

15
00:00:38,300 --> 00:00:42,480
Undocumented youth used to be able to apply
for a program called DACA , or deferred action

16
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:47,160
for childhood arrivals, to be able to legally
work and go to school and a whole bunch of

17
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:52,079
other things in the US. but since the current
administration put an end to the program,

18
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:58,320
hundreds of immigrant youth, hundreds of dreamers
are losing their legal protection every day.

19
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:01,480
Their lives as they know them, are on that
ticking clock.

20
00:01:01,480 --> 00:01:04,010
And there’s only one way we can stop it
from running out.

21
00:01:04,010 --> 00:01:06,830
So that’s why this Project for Awesome,
I’m supporting United We Dream.

22
00:01:06,830 --> 00:01:11,609
United We Dream is The largest organization
fighting to protect immigrant rights, led

23
00:01:11,609 --> 00:01:12,609
by immigrant youth.

24
00:01:12,609 --> 00:01:17,469
One of them, Adrian Reyna, talked to me about
what they do.

25
00:01:17,469 --> 00:01:23,429
And it is immigrant youth like me who are
working to achieve justice for immigrant communities

26
00:01:23,429 --> 00:01:25,740
all over the country.

27
00:01:25,740 --> 00:01:31,359
These are people that you work with, people
that you go to school with, These are people

28
00:01:31,359 --> 00:01:35,090
who have been here most of their lives.

29
00:01:35,090 --> 00:01:36,580
We are undocumented.

30
00:01:36,580 --> 00:01:42,840
And right now we’re fighting to pass the
dream act, which would be a piece of legislation

31
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:49,259
in the US Congress that would allow undocumented
immigrants who were impacted by the decision

32
00:01:49,259 --> 00:01:55,510
of the termination of the DACA program to
be able to have a pathway to citizenship.

33
00:01:55,510 --> 00:02:01,099
The Dream Act would provide a path to citizenship
to the 800,000 immigrant young people who

34
00:02:01,099 --> 00:02:03,009
are losing their DACA protections every day.

35
00:02:03,009 --> 00:02:07,959
And by the way, United We Dream led the campaign
that helped get DACA in the first place.

36
00:02:07,959 --> 00:02:12,170
So they’ve been at the forefront of this
fight for immigrant rights for a long time.

37
00:02:12,170 --> 00:02:16,530
But we’re at a critical moment for this
fight because the Dream Act has broad, bipartisan

38
00:02:16,530 --> 00:02:22,450
support recent polls show that 76% of americans
are in favor of the Dream Act, and the bill

39
00:02:22,450 --> 00:02:26,870
has Republican and Democratic co-sponsors
in both the house and senate.

40
00:02:26,870 --> 00:02:28,360
It just needs a vote.

41
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:30,640
And it needs a vote by the end of the year.

42
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:35,140
And it is urgent that we get this passed by
the end of the year because so many people

43
00:02:35,140 --> 00:02:36,670
have fallen out of status.

44
00:02:36,670 --> 00:02:42,580
Already over 11,000 people have lost protections
and are now at risk of deportation.

45
00:02:42,580 --> 00:02:50,400
And every day that passes without it passing
122 people lose protection, and are put at

46
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:51,760
risk of deportation.

47
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:56,650
United We Dream has worked to get DACA, they’ve
worked to provide education access for immigrants,

48
00:02:56,650 --> 00:03:02,340
they’ve worked to protect LGBTQ+ immigrants,
and now they’re working to get Dream in

49
00:03:02,340 --> 00:03:03,510
just the same way.

50
00:03:03,510 --> 00:03:07,370
They assemble a diverse group of leaders,
with immigrant youth at the forefront.

51
00:03:07,370 --> 00:03:10,160
And they put their voices and their bodies
on the line.

52
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:16,900
I want you to understand that for undocumented
youth, this is extremely dangerous work.

53
00:03:16,900 --> 00:03:20,310
Dreamers are risking arrest risking their
status trying to be heard.

54
00:03:20,310 --> 00:03:21,310
Trying to ask their representatives to see
them and treat them as human beings.

55
00:03:21,310 --> 00:03:22,820
So we need to stand with them.

56
00:03:22,820 --> 00:03:23,820
Here’s how.

57
00:03:23,820 --> 00:03:26,910
Right now we all know that right now there’s
a lot of hate going on, right?

58
00:03:26,910 --> 00:03:32,340
Like a lot of people are talking about how
immigrants are bad for America, and I think

59
00:03:32,340 --> 00:03:36,960
that this is the time where we need to articulate
a vision of justice.

60
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:41,260
Really be vocal about why we need the Dream
Act to pass this year.

61
00:03:41,260 --> 00:03:44,070
You can go to www.weareheretostay.org.

62
00:03:44,070 --> 00:03:51,600
There’s a sample script that you can use
to call your representatives and your senators

63
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:55,140
urging them to get the Dream Act passed before
the end of the year.

64
00:03:55,140 --> 00:04:01,100
If you are a citizen, a permanent resident,
or whatever immigration status you’re on,

65
00:04:01,100 --> 00:04:02,640
this is our fight together.

66
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:04,730
Dreamers need our support Now.

67
00:04:04,730 --> 00:04:06,730
Like I cannot stress that enough.

68
00:04:06,730 --> 00:04:07,730
Now.

69
00:04:07,730 --> 00:04:08,740
Before the end of the year.

70
00:04:08,740 --> 00:04:12,819
And they’re going to need our support after
that too, because xenophobia won’t go away

71
00:04:12,819 --> 00:04:13,819
with just one bill.

72
00:04:13,819 --> 00:04:17,750

76
00:04:32,340 --> 00:04:33,340
2017.

77
00:04:33,340 --> 00:04:36,310
Immigrants are people, they are part of us.

78
00:04:36,310 --> 00:04:40,250
Let’s make sure they are safe and welcome
in our shared home.

79
00:04:40,250 --> 00:04:41,840
Thanks, and happy Project For Awesome!

80
