again Here I am talking about how the left are defiling our arts and entertainment and everything we have known to grow up with this time it is the CW show Supergirl and they have cast a trans actress it's not that big of a deal but if you notice the article every single sentence not just the headline not just the whole main point of the story but every sentence says the word transgender so this is what I don't understand are they women or are they trans its trans its own thing because whenever we say that they're not women they get pissed off and they claim that they're actually real women and that there is no difference between genders but then next thing you know their whole campaign whether it's modeling or acting or being a superhero is that they want to claim that it's trans the character dreamer is not human so can she really be trans if so are they trying to push that trans would be common throughout the universe and not just a product of Earthlings if dreamer was left on earth as a child or transitioned after coming to earth does that mean trans is a product of environment and not biological the show has alien immigration in its storyline but it will be interesting to see if they have her transitioned before arriving or after if not it can be criticized as environmental she also comes from a matriarchal society that combined with modern feminism on earth might have influenced the desire to be woman her powers are also seeing the future primarily is this is subtle way of pushing trans matriarchy as the future they are trying to claim that they are real women but then they want to promote their agenda of trans trans trans everywhere I mean most people wouldn't really have a problem if they didn't know and you just acted and did your part I mean people were really upset about Scarlett Johansson trying to take a trans role and that's another example of how they want to market the niche of trans and keep that to its own thing but then they want to claim women's things as well and run in races and play in our sports and act like they are real women and get their periods yes believe it or not there is someone that tweeted that they get periods that that is not taught in schools and how wrong that is I can't keep up with this if you want to see more from me and the rest of the rebel team like and subscribe you
