we want to get now to some developing news that is breaking just this minute over on Capitol Hill and that is word of another Republican deciding to leave Congress we're talking about charlie dent Garrett Haake is over on Capitol Hill Garrett I was just handed the statement from charlie den announcing his intention to resign basically next month right talk us through this yeah Holly this is interesting so Charlie dent who would be a very familiar face to most of our viewers he's a on television quite a lot of very much a moderate Republican talks about himself as somebody in the sensible center represented a Philadelphia suburbs area for quite some time he had announced at the very beginning of this past year that he would be retiring at the end of his term but now in this statement just released by his office today says in fact he will resign his seat in May the statement doesn't get into specifics about why he might be doing so although it does serve as a reminder that in an election year once we get to the summer months there is very little legislating left to be done here on Capitol Hill focus here will shift almost entirely to the reelection efforts particularly for those folks in the house who have to run every two years but dent is somebody who I think a lot of people consider to be almost a dying breed and in Republican circles a northeastern moderate Republican who never embraced President Trump and who never embraced the tea party effort that preceded him sort of a man who essentially I think would say got left behind by his own party in terms of what he represents and what the party represents he had been a voice of some degree of caution about the Trump movement and of the movement of his party towards becoming Donald Trump's party and now announcing today that come May he will hang it up and return to Pennsylvania but Garrett pragmatically does this just Charlie dents departure from Congress at this point in time in May realistically legislatively change anything I get the sense that while he may be a voice speaking out against Donald Trump then it again on cable and and and over on the hill it doesn't seem like he is a swing vote when it comes to actual policy and my off base you know you're right on Ali I mean he's somebody who would be generally allied with leadership you know you would see him this is somebody who's gonna vote with Paul Ryan and vote against the freedom caucus folks time and time again it might make this a tiny gradient more difficult for leadership to pass something in which they know they might lose conservative votes but again when you're talking May you're talking the start of election season so I don't think you're going to see too many of those big fights in which Charlie dents vote would be crucial and he kind of in a similar way to Jeff Flake in the Senate got to a point where he's essentially speaking for himself there aren't a bunch of other Republican lawmakers lined up behind Charlie den who say as goes Charlie dent so go I he has been something of a lone dissenter in a lot of ways Garrett Haake doing double duty for us this morning over on Capitol Hill Garrett thank you my friend appreciate it hey there I'm Chris Hayes from MSNBC thanks for watching MSNBC on youtube if you want to keep up to date with the videos we're putting out you can click subscribe just below me or click over on this list to see lots of other great videos
