00:00:02,785 --> 00:00:04,854
>> Laura: THE AHS SECRETARY WILL

2
00:00:04,854 --> 00:00:08,758
BE UNVEILING THE POLICY.

3
00:00:08,758 --> 00:00:11,294
COMING UP, A HIGH DIVE OFF THE

4
00:00:11,294 --> 00:00:12,829
DEEP END.

5
00:00:12,829 --> 00:00:14,998
HIS PIECE ON WEDNESDAY WAS

6
00:00:14,998 --> 00:00:17,867
HEADLINED TRUMP IS NO LONGER THE

7
00:00:17,867 --> 00:00:23,306
WORST PERSON IN GOVERNMENT.

8
00:00:23,439 --> 00:00:23,740
NO.

9
00:00:23,740 --> 00:00:25,441
NOT SCOTT PRUETT, NO.

10
00:00:25,441 --> 00:00:26,943
IT'S VICE PRESIDENT MIKE PENCE.

11
00:00:26,943 --> 00:00:30,613
LOW KEY, SELF-EFFACING AND LOYAL

12
00:00:30,613 --> 00:00:33,983
MIKE PENCE, HOW COULD THAT BE?

13
00:00:33,983 --> 00:00:44,327
GEORGE WILL HAS A CON FISHCY

14
00:00:44,327 --> 00:00:44,360
GEORGE WILL HAS A CON FI CCY

15
00:00:44,360 --> 00:00:44,460
GEORGE WILL HAS A CON FI CONSPIR

16
00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:44,494
GEORGE WILL HAS A CON FI CONSPIC

17
00:00:44,494 --> 00:00:44,727
GEORGE WILL HAS A CON FI CONSPI.

18
00:00:44,727 --> 00:00:47,764
HE COULD BECOME THE MOST

19
00:00:47,764 --> 00:00:49,098
REPULSIVE FIGURE.

20
00:00:49,098 --> 00:00:50,900
TRUMP PICKED PENCE BECAUSE

21
00:00:50,900 --> 00:00:53,703
AMERICA WOULD HAVE SUCH

22
00:00:53,703 --> 00:00:56,339
REVULSION FOR HIS VP, IT WOULD

23
00:00:56,339 --> 00:00:59,275
TAKE THE HEAT OFF THE PRESIDENT

24
00:00:59,275 --> 00:00:59,642
HIMSELF.

25
00:00:59,642 --> 00:01:03,446
WHAT MAKES PENCE SO REPULSIVE?

26
00:01:03,446 --> 00:01:05,648
WILL CITED THE POST CALCULATIONS

27
00:01:05,648 --> 00:01:09,218
THAT DURING A CABINET MEETING

28
00:01:09,218 --> 00:01:11,387
PENCE PRAISED TRUMP ONCE EVERY

29
00:01:11,387 --> 00:01:13,689
12 SECOND FOR THREE MINUTES WITH

30
00:01:13,689 --> 00:01:16,926
SUCH COMMENTS AS, QUOTE, I AM

31
00:01:16,926 --> 00:01:18,327
DEEPLY HUMBLED.

32
00:01:18,327 --> 00:01:21,864
HE DOESN'T FIND THE HUMILITY

33
00:01:21,864 --> 00:01:23,566
REPULSIVE, HE SEEMS TO HAVE SOME

34
00:01:23,566 --> 00:01:29,772
KIND OF ISSUE WITH PENCE'S FACE.

35
00:01:29,906 --> 00:01:34,644
THE FAVORITE PINUPS, THE SPIRIT

36
00:01:34,644 --> 00:01:38,548
AND THE VICIOUS PORTION REQUIRE.

37
00:01:38,548 --> 00:01:41,150
WILL WAS OFFENDED THAT PENCE

38
00:01:41,150 --> 00:01:42,585
WOULD CALL HIMSELF HONORED BY

39
00:01:42,585 --> 00:01:47,390
THE PRESENCE OF FORMER SHERIFF

40
00:01:47,390 --> 00:01:49,725
JOE APIYO.

41
00:01:49,725 --> 00:01:51,928
HE CALLED HIM A TIRELESS

42
00:01:51,928 --> 00:01:53,496
CHAMPION OF THE RULE OF LAW.

43
00:01:53,496 --> 00:01:57,033
ACCORDING TO THE REPULSIVE

44
00:01:57,033 --> 00:01:58,501
HUMILITY, RESPECT FOR THE LAW,

45
00:01:58,501 --> 00:02:02,972
MAKE HIM THE AUTHENTIC VOICE OF

46
00:02:02,972 --> 00:02:05,975
TODAY'S REPUBLICAN PARTY.

47
00:02:05,975 --> 00:02:07,643
WELL, THE ACCUSATIONS WERE

48
00:02:07,643 --> 00:02:09,479
PICKED UP BY THE FEEDBACK LOOP

49
00:02:09,479 --> 00:02:12,482
ON THE LEFT AS AN OPPORTUNITY TO

50
00:02:12,482 --> 00:02:14,083
SMEAR THE VICE PRESIDENT.

51
00:02:14,083 --> 00:02:16,853
>> WHO IS MIKE PENCE?

52
00:02:16,853 --> 00:02:17,487
I DON'T KNOW.

53
00:02:17,487 --> 00:02:20,723
HE DOESN'T SEEM TO HAVE CORE

54
00:02:20,723 --> 00:02:23,159
CONVICTS OR BELIEFS BEYOND

55
00:02:23,159 --> 00:02:24,093
WHATEVER DONALD TRUMP DECIDED

56
00:02:24,093 --> 00:02:24,627
THEY ARE.

57
00:02:24,627 --> 00:02:26,596
>> HE'S STRIKING THIS BALANCE,

58
00:02:26,596 --> 00:02:31,534
TRYING TO BE THE MAN THAT WILL

59
00:02:31,534 --> 00:02:33,336
INHERIT THE MANTLE OF TRUMP.

60
00:02:33,336 --> 00:02:35,705
>> THERE ARE TWO VICE

61
00:02:35,705 --> 00:02:36,105
PRESIDENTS.

62
00:02:36,105 --> 00:02:39,242
THOSE ACCUSED OF BEING OUT FOR

63
00:02:39,242 --> 00:02:40,443
THEMSELVES THAT THEY ARE NOT

64
00:02:40,443 --> 00:02:42,612
SERVING THE PRESIDENT WHO PICKED

65
00:02:42,612 --> 00:02:46,616
THEM AND THOSE ACCUSED OF BEING

66
00:02:46,616 --> 00:02:49,752
SLAVISHLY LOYAL LAP DOGS.

67
00:02:49,752 --> 00:02:51,821
MIKE PENCE DECIDED TO BE THE

68
00:02:51,821 --> 00:02:52,155
LATTER.

69
00:02:52,155 --> 00:02:56,626
>> HE IS A TITANIC FRAUD.

70
00:02:56,626 --> 00:02:59,061
HE'S THE MOST OF ALL THE

71
00:02:59,061 --> 00:03:00,796
CULTISTS IN THE CABINET.

72
00:03:00,796 --> 00:03:04,500
WE HAVE NEVER SEEN SUCH

73
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:07,703
SLOBBERINGER

74
00:03:07,703 --> 00:03:09,038
SLOBBERING IN THIS COUNTRY THAN

75
00:03:09,038 --> 00:03:12,008
WE DO WITH MIKE PENCE.

76
00:03:12,008 --> 00:03:13,309
>> Laura: CONSIDER THE SOURCE,

77
00:03:13,309 --> 00:03:14,744
MY FRIEND.

78
00:03:14,744 --> 00:03:17,146
IS PENCE REALLY THE WORST PERSON

79
00:03:17,146 --> 00:03:18,181
IN GOVERNMENT?

80
00:03:18,181 --> 00:03:20,516
WHY ARE THE PENCE HATERS LASHING

81
00:03:20,516 --> 00:03:21,884
OUT NOW?

82
00:03:21,884 --> 00:03:24,587
IT'S INTERESTING.

83
00:03:24,587 --> 00:03:27,723
LET'S ASK MARK LOTTER, AND

84
00:03:27,723 --> 00:03:30,626
DEMOCRATIC PARTY ACTIVIST, CHRIS

85
00:03:30,626 --> 00:03:31,227
HAN.

86
00:03:31,227 --> 00:03:33,029
MARK, LET'S GO TO YOU.

87
00:03:33,029 --> 00:03:37,433
I HAVE KNOWN MIKE PENCE WHEN HE

88
00:03:37,433 --> 00:03:39,202
WAS IN CONGRESS.

89
00:03:39,202 --> 00:03:41,270
I FOUND THAT FROM GEORGE WILL

90
00:03:41,270 --> 00:03:42,004
REALLY SAD.

91
00:03:42,004 --> 00:03:43,873
HE'S HAD AN UNBELIEVABLE CAREER

92
00:03:43,873 --> 00:03:47,710
AS ONE OF THE PREMIER

93
00:03:47,710 --> 00:03:48,511
COLUMNISTS, WRITERS IN THE

94
00:03:48,511 --> 00:03:50,213
UNITED STATES, HE DOESN'T LIKE

95
00:03:50,213 --> 00:03:51,614
DONALD TRUMP, THAT'S FINE.

96
00:03:51,614 --> 00:03:54,083
BUT I THOUGHT IT WAS FILLED WITH

97
00:03:54,083 --> 00:03:55,851
SUCH LOW BLOWS.

98
00:03:55,851 --> 00:03:58,187
I WASN'T EVEN ANGRY ABOUT IT.

99
00:03:58,187 --> 00:04:00,690
I WAS SAD ABOUT IT.

100
00:04:00,690 --> 00:04:05,628
>> IN 1986 HE WROTE A COLUMN

101
00:04:05,628 --> 00:04:07,196
CALLED THEN VICE PRESIDENT

102
00:04:07,196 --> 00:04:10,166
GEORGE BUSH A LAP DOG.

103
00:04:10,166 --> 00:04:14,270
HE WOULD GO ON TO BE A

104
00:04:14,270 --> 00:04:15,838
TRANSFORMATIONAL PRESIDENT.

105
00:04:15,838 --> 00:04:19,007
HE HAS A PROBLEM WITH VICE

106
00:04:19,007 --> 00:04:20,041
PRESIDENTS WHO SERVE PRESIDENTS

107
00:04:20,041 --> 00:04:21,277
OF THE UNITED STATES.

108
00:04:21,277 --> 00:04:23,212
TO GET TO USE A BASEBALL TERM I

109
00:04:23,212 --> 00:04:25,648
KNOW GEORGE WOULD LIKE, THE BEST

110
00:04:25,648 --> 00:04:30,219
PLAYERS IN THE WORLD MISS SEVEN

111
00:04:30,219 --> 00:04:32,488
OUT OF TEN TIMES.

112
00:04:32,488 --> 00:04:35,291
HE STRUCK OUT IN THE DIRT.

113
00:04:35,291 --> 00:04:37,026
>> Laura: THERE WERE OVERTONES

114
00:04:37,026 --> 00:04:37,994
IN THIS COLUMN.

115
00:04:37,994 --> 00:04:40,963
HE WAS PICKED UP BY MEDIA

116
00:04:40,963 --> 00:04:41,397
FIGURES.

117
00:04:41,397 --> 00:04:48,371
HE TALKS ABOUT HOW HE GENUFLEX

118
00:04:48,371 --> 00:04:50,406
AT THE ALTER.

119
00:04:50,406 --> 00:04:53,342
IT SEEMED CONDESCENDING ABOUT

120
00:04:53,342 --> 00:04:55,411
MIKE PENCE'S FACE, QUESTIONING

121
00:04:55,411 --> 00:04:57,480
HIS FACE, YOU ARE NOT A REAL

122
00:04:57,480 --> 00:04:57,980
QUESTION.

123
00:04:57,980 --> 00:05:00,783
HE DIDN'T WRITE THAT.

124
00:05:00,783 --> 00:05:03,786
YOU CAN READ BETWEEN THE LINES.

125
00:05:03,786 --> 00:05:04,787
I LIKE GEORGE WILL.

126
00:05:04,787 --> 00:05:07,390
A LOT OF PEOPLE DON'T LIKE HIM.

127
00:05:07,390 --> 00:05:08,991
I HAVE KNOWN HIM FOR A LONG

128
00:05:08,991 --> 00:05:09,292
TIME.

129
00:05:09,292 --> 00:05:11,994
IT PAINS ME TO SAY THIS, BUT I

130
00:05:11,994 --> 00:05:14,163
THOUGHT THE COLUMN WAS BENEATH

131
00:05:14,163 --> 00:05:16,399
HIM AND FILLED WITH LOW BLOWS

132
00:05:16,399 --> 00:05:18,768
AND NOT AT ALL IN ANY WAY

133
00:05:18,768 --> 00:05:20,303
ILLUSTRATIVE OF THE MAN WHO MIKE

134
00:05:20,303 --> 00:05:21,070
PENCE IS.

135
00:05:21,070 --> 00:05:23,105
HE'S A WONDERFUL PERSON AND I

136
00:05:23,105 --> 00:05:26,409
THINK A VERY EFFECTIVE VICE

137
00:05:26,409 --> 00:05:26,776
PRESIDENT.

138
00:05:26,776 --> 00:05:29,378
>> THE COLUMN GOT PICKED UP

139
00:05:29,378 --> 00:05:30,379
BROADLY BECAUSE THE VICE

140
00:05:30,379 --> 00:05:36,385
PRESIDENT DECIDED TO PLAGIARIZE

141
00:05:36,385 --> 00:05:36,986
RICHARD NIXON.

142
00:05:36,986 --> 00:05:39,188
WHILE I DO THINK THE TONE WAS

143
00:05:39,188 --> 00:05:41,424
HARSH, IT'S NOT LIKE GEORGE WILL

144
00:05:41,424 --> 00:05:42,925
SAID HIS OPINION DOESN'T MATTER

145
00:05:42,925 --> 00:05:44,593
BECAUSE HE'S ABOUT TO DIE, WHICH

146
00:05:44,593 --> 00:05:46,629
IS SOMETHING THAT'S BEEN SAID

147
00:05:46,629 --> 00:05:48,030
INSIDE THE WHITE HOUSE THESE

148
00:05:48,030 --> 00:05:48,331
DAYS.

149
00:05:48,331 --> 00:05:50,166
WE GOT TO BACK OFF ON THIS IS

150
00:05:50,166 --> 00:05:51,767
SUCH A BAD THING.

151
00:05:51,767 --> 00:05:53,869
THE VICE PRESIDENT IS THE

152
00:05:53,869 --> 00:05:56,772
BOOT-LIQUOR IN CHIEF IN THIS

153
00:05:56,772 --> 00:05:57,239
ADMINISTRATION.

154
00:05:57,239 --> 00:06:00,343
HE PRAISES THE PRESIDENT, HE

155
00:06:00,343 --> 00:06:01,811
KISSES HIS BUTT.

156
00:06:01,811 --> 00:06:04,046
WHAT'S SAD, IN TO 20 THIS

157
00:06:04,046 --> 00:06:06,349
PRESIDENT WILL DROP HIM FROM THE

158
00:06:06,349 --> 00:06:07,616
TICKET BECAUSE THIS PRESIDENT

159
00:06:07,616 --> 00:06:09,051
CARES ABOUT RATINGS.

160
00:06:09,051 --> 00:06:10,986
WHO HE PICKS AT THE CONVENTION

161
00:06:10,986 --> 00:06:13,289
WILL BE THE BIGGEST RATINGS

162
00:06:13,289 --> 00:06:14,990
NIGHT OF THAT WEEK.

163
00:06:14,990 --> 00:06:16,025
MR. PENCE, YOU MIGHT WANT TO

164
00:06:16,025 --> 00:06:17,426
STAND UP TO THIS PRESIDENT

165
00:06:17,426 --> 00:06:18,594
BECAUSE HE'S NOT GOING TO STAND

166
00:06:18,594 --> 00:06:22,398
BY YOU IN THE END.

167
00:06:22,398 --> 00:06:24,133
>> Laura: WERE YOU CONCERNED

168
00:06:24,133 --> 00:06:26,335
ABOUT VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN

169
00:06:26,335 --> 00:06:28,003
TAKING ON OBAMA?

170
00:06:28,003 --> 00:06:29,905
I'M TRYING TO REMEMBER, WAIT, HE

171
00:06:29,905 --> 00:06:32,508
NEVER DID.

172
00:06:32,508 --> 00:06:36,645
WHEN DID VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN

173
00:06:36,645 --> 00:06:40,316
TAKE ON OBAMA FOR CREWING UP THE

174
00:06:40,316 --> 00:06:42,785
HEALTHCARE WEBSITE, FOR HOUNDING

175
00:06:42,785 --> 00:06:46,021
PEOPLE WHO APPLIED FOR IRS

176
00:06:46,021 --> 00:06:46,455
STATUS.

177
00:06:46,455 --> 00:06:48,824
WHEN DID BIDEN COME OUT AND

178
00:06:48,824 --> 00:06:52,094
CHALLENGE OBAMA'S ABUSE OF

179
00:06:52,094 --> 00:06:54,130
POWER?

180
00:06:54,130 --> 00:06:54,630
NEVER.

181
00:06:54,630 --> 00:06:57,400
WHY GO AFTER MIKE PENCE.

182
00:06:57,400 --> 00:07:01,203
YOU DIDN'T CRITICIZE BIDEN

183
00:07:01,203 --> 00:07:03,205
BECAUSE HIS ROLE IS TO SUPPORT

184
00:07:03,205 --> 00:07:06,242
THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED

185
00:07:06,242 --> 00:07:06,575
STATES.

186
00:07:06,575 --> 00:07:09,845
>> WHY IS MIKE PENCE BEING

187
00:07:09,845 --> 00:07:10,212
ATTACKED?

188
00:07:10,212 --> 00:07:12,681
IT'S ABOUT PRIDE AND EVE GO OF

189
00:07:12,681 --> 00:07:15,418
THESE NEVER-TRUMP WRITERS.

190
00:07:15,418 --> 00:07:17,186
THEY CAN'T ADMIT THE AAGAIN

191
00:07:17,186 --> 00:07:22,124
TODAY IS THE MOST CONSERVATIVE

192
00:07:22,124 --> 00:07:22,458
AGENDA.

193
00:07:22,458 --> 00:07:25,928
MIKE PENCE, A MAN WITH A 99%

194
00:07:25,928 --> 00:07:27,363
VOTING RECORD, I DON'T KNOW WHAT

195
00:07:27,363 --> 00:07:29,131
HE EVER GOT WRONG, BUT HE GOT

196
00:07:29,131 --> 00:07:32,435
ONE THING WRONG, ONE TIME, IN

197
00:07:32,435 --> 00:07:34,136
ALL THE TIME IN CONGRESS, YOU

198
00:07:34,136 --> 00:07:36,238
GET ATTACKED BY THESE PEOPLE

199
00:07:36,238 --> 00:07:39,642
BECAUSE THEY THINK WE ARE

200
00:07:39,642 --> 00:07:40,042
DEPLORABLE.

201
00:07:40,042 --> 00:07:40,743
THEY DON'T THINK WE HAVE ANY

202
00:07:40,743 --> 00:07:44,079
MORAL STANDING TO MAKE THE CASE

203
00:07:44,079 --> 00:07:45,881
THAT WHAT DONALD TRUMP IS DOING

204
00:07:45,881 --> 00:07:48,250
IS THE RIGHT THING.

205
00:07:48,250 --> 00:07:49,318
>> Laura: WHEN HILLARY TALKED

206
00:07:49,318 --> 00:07:52,421
ABOUT THE BASKET OF DEPLORABLES.

207
00:07:52,421 --> 00:07:54,590
GEORGE WILL, IN THIS MOMENT, HAS

208
00:07:54,590 --> 00:07:56,659
MORE IN COMMON WITH THEIR VIEW

209
00:07:56,659 --> 00:07:59,061
OF MIDDLE AMERICA FROM WHERE

210
00:07:59,061 --> 00:08:00,329
MIKE PENCE CAME THAN HE DOES

211
00:08:00,329 --> 00:08:03,866
WITH THE CONSERVATIVE VOTERS

212
00:08:03,866 --> 00:08:08,671
ACROSS AMERICA WHO SAID WE ARE

213
00:08:08,804 --> 00:08:13,342
ARE GOING TO TAKE SOMEBODY WHO

214
00:08:13,342 --> 00:08:15,511
TAKES A WRECKING BALL.

215
00:08:15,511 --> 00:08:16,912
IT'S UNBECOMING.

216
00:08:16,912 --> 00:08:18,848
MILLIONS OF AMERICANS ARE

217
00:08:18,848 --> 00:08:21,450
HORRIBLE, AWFUL, RACIST,

218
00:08:21,450 --> 00:08:23,986
TERRIBLE PEOPLE.

219
00:08:23,986 --> 00:08:24,320
REALLY?

220
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:25,688
GOOD LUCK BUILDING A MOVEMENT ON

221
00:08:25,688 --> 00:08:26,388
THAT DAY.

222
00:08:26,388 --> 00:08:28,224
>> THIS IS NOT THE FIRST TIME

223
00:08:28,224 --> 00:08:29,458
THIS HAPPENED.

224
00:08:29,458 --> 00:08:34,129
SAME THING HAPPENED IN 1980 WHEN

225
00:08:34,129 --> 00:08:37,967
THE AMERICAN PEOPLE TURNED THEIR

226
00:08:37,967 --> 00:08:39,467
BACK ON THE REPUBLICANS.

227
00:08:39,467 --> 00:08:41,035
THEY DID IT IN PRESIDENT TRUMP

228
00:08:41,035 --> 00:08:46,275
AND THE ELITISTS CAN'T GET OVER

229
00:08:46,275 --> 00:08:47,710
IT.

230
00:08:47,710 --> 00:08:49,345
>> Laura: TRUMP DOESN'T KEEP A

231
00:08:49,345 --> 00:08:53,649
THEY SORRIES BY HIS BED.

232
00:08:53,649 --> 00:08:55,784
IT'S THE SEVEN SYLLABLE WORDS.

233
00:08:55,784 --> 00:08:57,653
I LIKE THAT.

234
00:08:57,653 --> 00:08:59,255
BUT GO AHEAD, CHRIS.

235
00:08:59,255 --> 00:09:01,190
MY CONCERN HERE IS THAT THE

236
00:09:01,190 --> 00:09:03,592
TIMING OF THIS IS CURIOUS, THEY

237
00:09:03,592 --> 00:09:05,895
ARE STRIKING OUT ON TRUMP.

238
00:09:05,895 --> 00:09:08,230
TRUMP'S NUMBERS ARE GOING UP.

239
00:09:08,230 --> 00:09:09,532
THEY THINK THEY CAN GET

240
00:09:09,532 --> 00:09:10,833
SOMETHING ON PENCE.

241
00:09:10,833 --> 00:09:12,668
TRUMP'S NUMBERS ARE IMPROVING

242
00:09:12,668 --> 00:09:14,036
BECAUSE THE RESULTS ARE THERE

243
00:09:14,036 --> 00:09:15,371
FOR THE AMERICAN PEOPLE.

244
00:09:15,371 --> 00:09:18,274
>> NOBODY IS GOING TO BASE THEIR

245
00:09:18,274 --> 00:09:20,009
NUMBERS ON TRUMP ON WHAT PENCE

246
00:09:20,009 --> 00:09:21,110
IS DOING.

247
00:09:21,110 --> 00:09:23,012
I THINK GEORGE WILL HAD A

248
00:09:23,012 --> 00:09:25,714
FEELING ABOUT MIKE PENCE BASED

249
00:09:25,714 --> 00:09:27,216
ON WHAT HAPPENED IN ARIZONA WHEN

250
00:09:27,216 --> 00:09:29,151
HE WENT OUT THERE.

251
00:09:29,151 --> 00:09:31,420
A LOT OF PEOPLE HAVE REASON TO

252
00:09:31,420 --> 00:09:33,923
THINK JOE IS SOMEBODY WHO NOT BE

253
00:09:33,923 --> 00:09:36,058
TOUTED BY THE VICE PRESIDENT OR

254
00:09:36,058 --> 00:09:37,560
THE PRESIDENT.

255
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:40,996
HE DISOBEYED A COURT ORDER WHAT

256
00:09:40,996 --> 00:09:42,698
HE DID WAS RACIST.

257
00:09:42,698 --> 00:09:44,733
SO I THINK GEORGE WILL SEES

258
00:09:44,733 --> 00:09:45,034
THAT.

259
00:09:45,034 --> 00:09:46,335
THIS IS NOT THE REPUBLICAN

260
00:09:46,335 --> 00:09:48,037
PARTY, THIS IS NOT THE

261
00:09:48,037 --> 00:09:49,939
CONSERVATIVE MOVEMENT HE GREW UP

262
00:09:49,939 --> 00:09:50,239
WITH.

263
00:09:50,239 --> 00:09:54,109
HE WOULD LIKE TO SEE MIKE PENCE

264
00:09:54,109 --> 00:09:57,813
BE THE BACKBONE TO

265
00:09:57,813 --> 00:09:58,280
CONSERVATIVISM.

266
00:09:58,280 --> 00:10:00,516
MIKE PENCE HAS BEEN A

267
00:10:00,516 --> 00:10:01,951
CONSERVATIVE ALL HIS LIFE.

268
00:10:01,951 --> 00:10:04,787
SO IF HE'S BECOMING MORE LIKE

269
00:10:04,787 --> 00:10:07,056
DONALD TRUMP, THEN CONSERVATIVES

270
00:10:07,056 --> 00:10:09,158
WILL HAVE A PROBLEM WITH THAT.

271
00:10:09,158 --> 00:10:10,392
THAT'S WHAT HE WAS LASHING OUT

272
00:10:10,392 --> 00:10:11,160
ABOUT IT.

273
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:12,595
YOU WANT PEOPLE TO TALK ABOUT

274
00:10:12,595 --> 00:10:15,331
IT, YOU BETTER SAY SOME CRAZY

275
00:10:15,331 --> 00:10:15,664
THINGS.

276
00:10:15,664 --> 00:10:16,966
>> YOU ARE GOING GOOD.

277
00:10:16,966 --> 00:10:18,701
ALL I WOULD SAY THIS, DO WE WANT

278
00:10:18,701 --> 00:10:22,371
TO WIN OR DO WE NOT WANT TO WIN?

279
00:10:22,371 --> 00:10:24,974
IF THE PRESIDENT TALKED ABOUT

280
00:10:24,974 --> 00:10:25,841
WINNING.

281
00:10:25,841 --> 00:10:28,110
CONSERVATIVES ARE GETTING MORE

282
00:10:28,110 --> 00:10:28,410
DONE.

283
00:10:28,410 --> 00:10:31,647
WE ARE IN A WINDOW --

284
00:10:31,647 --> 00:10:39,121
>> Laura: AZAR IS GOING TO BE

285
00:10:39,121 --> 00:10:39,388
BIG.

286
00:10:39,388 --> 00:10:41,323
HE CLERKED WITH ME.

287
00:10:41,323 --> 00:10:43,859
HE COULD HAVE BEEN A CABINET

288
00:10:43,859 --> 00:10:44,226
SECRETARY.

289
00:10:44,226 --> 00:10:45,594
HE'S DOING THIS BECAUSE WE GOT

290
00:10:45,594 --> 00:10:47,262
TO GET THIS PRESCRIPTION DRUG

291
00:10:47,262 --> 00:10:49,198
STUFF, THIS HAS TO BE TACKLED.

292
00:10:49,198 --> 00:10:52,501
HE WILL DO A LOT MORE.

293
00:10:52,501 --> 00:10:54,503
THESE -- HOLD ON, CHRIS.

294
00:10:54,503 --> 00:10:56,438
THESE ARE PEOPLE OF REAL

295
00:10:56,438 --> 00:10:57,740
SUBSTANCE WHO ARE DOING REALLY

296
00:10:57,740 --> 00:10:59,308
HARD WORK.

297
00:10:59,308 --> 00:11:06,649
I THINK IT REALLY URKS PEOPLE.

298
00:11:06,649 --> 00:11:08,584
WHEN STEVE SCHMIDT, BECAUSE HE

299
00:11:08,584 --> 00:11:18,293
RAN A GREAT CAMPAIGN WITH

300
00:11:18,293 --> 00:11:18,627
PAILEN.

301
00:11:18,627 --> 00:11:20,929
>> WE HAVE LISTENED TO THIS GUY

302
00:11:20,929 --> 00:11:24,333
FOR MANY YEARS ON HIS MORAL HIGH

303
00:11:24,333 --> 00:11:25,234
HORSE.

304
00:11:25,234 --> 00:11:27,970
ASSAULTING THE DIGNITY OF GUY

305
00:11:27,970 --> 00:11:31,707
PEOPLE, ACROSS THE BOARD.

306
00:11:31,707 --> 00:11:35,778
HIS MORAL PREENING IS FAMOUS

307
00:11:35,778 --> 00:11:39,915
THROUGHOUT THE LAND.

308
00:11:39,915 --> 00:11:40,649
>> Laura: HE JUST SWORE IN A GUY

309
00:11:40,649 --> 00:11:42,718
AMERICAN TO BE A NEW AMBASSADOR

310
00:11:42,718 --> 00:11:45,988
TO GERMANY.

311
00:11:45,988 --> 00:11:48,190
SO IF YOU ARE A FAITHFUL

312
00:11:48,190 --> 00:11:51,360
CHRISTIAN AS HE IS, HE'S, BY

313
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:53,796
NATURE HOMOPHOBIC.

314
00:11:53,796 --> 00:11:56,131
YOU CAN'T DISAGREE.

315
00:11:56,131 --> 00:12:02,037
IT'S A LITANY.

316
00:12:02,037 --> 00:12:07,376
>> HE PANDERS TO PEOPLE WHO ARE

317
00:12:07,376 --> 00:12:07,776
HOMOPHOBIC.

318
00:12:07,776 --> 00:12:09,812
I THINK THIS IS A GREAT THING

319
00:12:09,812 --> 00:12:11,613
FOR THE COUNTRY, THE

320
00:12:11,613 --> 00:12:12,748
ADMINISTRATION AND AMERICA.

321
00:12:12,748 --> 00:12:13,515
LOOK AT THE TIMING.

322
00:12:13,515 --> 00:12:15,884
IF YOU LOOK AT THE POLLS, IT'S

323
00:12:15,884 --> 00:12:18,954
THE RIGHT TRACK, WRONG TRACK,

324
00:12:18,954 --> 00:12:20,155
IMPROVING.

325
00:12:20,155 --> 00:12:21,957
TRUMPS NUMBERS GET BETTER.

326
00:12:21,957 --> 00:12:24,460
YOU KNOW THE ONLY PLACE HE'S

327
00:12:24,460 --> 00:12:24,760
WEAK?

328
00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:25,861
FOREIGN AFFAIRS.

329
00:12:25,861 --> 00:12:29,164
WHAT THE DEMOCRATS ARE SEEING IS

330
00:12:29,164 --> 00:12:30,899
THIS BIG BLUE WAVE IS STARTING

331
00:12:30,899 --> 00:12:33,769
TO GO AWAY.

332
00:12:33,769 --> 00:12:37,639
>> Laura: CHRIS, I WANT TO PLAY

333
00:12:37,639 --> 00:12:48,951
A BYTE FROM NICOLE WALLACE.

334
00:12:48,951 --> 00:12:51,754
>> WHY CAN'T YOU SAY IF HE SAYS

335
00:12:51,754 --> 00:12:56,024
THAT, SHE WILL BE FIRED.

336
00:12:56,024 --> 00:12:59,194
>> Laura: HOW DO YOU RESIST THE

337
00:12:59,194 --> 00:13:02,097
TEMPTATION TO RUN UP AND RING

338
00:13:02,097 --> 00:13:04,700
HER NECK?

339
00:13:04,700 --> 00:13:07,836
SHE SAID IT'S GETTING TO HER,

340
00:13:07,836 --> 00:13:09,638
USED POORLY CHOSEN WORD.

341
00:13:09,638 --> 00:13:10,773
FOR THAT I'M SORRY.

342
00:13:10,773 --> 00:13:14,009
THEY ARE TALKING ABOUT THE

343
00:13:14,009 --> 00:13:16,979
COMMENT MADE BY STADLER.

344
00:13:16,979 --> 00:13:18,781
IT WAS MADE IN PRIVATE.

345
00:13:18,781 --> 00:13:21,350
>> WELL, HOLD ON A MINUTE, GUYS.

346
00:13:21,350 --> 00:13:26,789
YOU KNOW, LOOK, MATT, MATT,

347
00:13:26,789 --> 00:13:28,590
NICOLE APOLOGIZED, THE WHITE

348
00:13:28,590 --> 00:13:32,294
HOUSE SHOULD APOLOGIZE ABOUT THE

349
00:13:32,294 --> 00:13:33,495
AMERICAN HERO.

350
00:13:33,495 --> 00:13:36,231
I DON'T KNOW WHY?

351
00:13:36,231 --> 00:13:38,867
JOHN McCAIN, I DON'T AGREE

352
00:13:38,867 --> 00:13:42,771
WITH JOHN McCAIN ON A LOT OF

353
00:13:42,771 --> 00:13:47,176
THINGS, HE IS A HERO.

354
00:13:47,176 --> 00:13:48,844
>> YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT HAPPENED

355
00:13:48,844 --> 00:13:50,946
IN A PRIVATE MEETING.

356
00:13:50,946 --> 00:13:52,147
NONE OF US KNOWS.

357
00:13:52,147 --> 00:13:53,816
>> THEY ADMITTED IT.

358
00:13:53,816 --> 00:13:56,552
>> I THINK JOHN McCAIN

359
00:13:56,552 --> 00:13:58,554
DESERVES HIS PEACE AND QUIET.

360
00:13:58,554 --> 00:14:00,189
BUT HE STILL HAS A VOTING

361
00:14:00,189 --> 00:14:00,589
RECORD.

362
00:14:00,589 --> 00:14:02,424
IT'S OKAY TO TALK ABOUT IT AND

363
00:14:02,424 --> 00:14:04,827
OKAY TO TALK ABOUT HIM OPPOSING

364
00:14:04,827 --> 00:14:07,496
THE PRESIDENT'S NOMINEE.

365
00:14:07,496 --> 00:14:10,899
>> Laura: YOU KNOW WHAT JOHN

366
00:14:10,899 --> 00:14:11,733
McCAIN SAID?

367
00:14:11,733 --> 00:14:14,937
>> MATT, SO MUCH RHETORIC THAT

368
00:14:14,937 --> 00:14:16,905
NEEDS TO CALM DOWN, IT START AT

369
00:14:16,905 --> 00:14:20,342
THE TOP, STARTS WITH THE

370
00:14:20,342 --> 00:14:20,709
PRESIDENT.

371
00:14:20,709 --> 00:14:23,512
>> NOW YOU ARE GOING TO

372
00:14:23,512 --> 00:14:24,313
ATTACK --

373
00:14:24,313 --> 00:14:26,248
>> Laura: WELL, I THINK CHRIS,

374
00:14:26,248 --> 00:14:29,218
CHRIS, WE CAN GO BACK AND I CAN

375
00:14:29,218 --> 00:14:31,153
CHERRY PICK THE BRIGHT LIGHTS OF

376
00:14:31,153 --> 00:14:32,788
THE LEFT AND THE ENTERTAINMENT

377
00:14:32,788 --> 00:14:35,157
INDUSTRY AND MEDIA, NOW WE ARE

378
00:14:35,157 --> 00:14:36,291
THREATENING TO CHOKE PEOPLE.

379
00:14:36,291 --> 00:14:39,161
WE ARE GOING TO BLOW THE WHITE

380
00:14:39,161 --> 00:14:41,296
HOUSE UP.

381
00:14:41,296 --> 00:14:44,600
IF WE ARE GOING TO TALK ABOUT

382
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:48,136
VITREAL, CHECK OUT MY TWITTER

383
00:14:48,136 --> 00:14:48,437
FEED.

384
00:14:48,437 --> 00:14:50,539
>> AND MINE.

385
00:14:50,539 --> 00:14:52,975
>> Laura: DON'T PRETEND TO BE

386
00:14:52,975 --> 00:14:55,711
LIKE THESE SHRINKING VIOLETS.

387
00:14:55,711 --> 00:14:58,380
JOHN McCAIN IS A HERO.

388
00:14:58,380 --> 00:15:00,082
HE DISAGREED WITH THE PRESIDENT.

389
00:15:00,082 --> 00:15:02,184
HE SAID DON'T FEEL SORRY FOR ME.

390
00:15:02,184 --> 00:15:04,953
I'M GOING TO FIGHT MY FIGHT,

391
00:15:04,953 --> 00:15:07,656
HE'S NOT SOMEONE WHO WANT TO BE

392
00:15:07,656 --> 00:15:09,324
TREATED WITH KIT GLOVES.

393
00:15:09,324 --> 00:15:11,760
HE'S A TOUGH GUY WHO CAN HANDLE

394
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:14,596
HIMSELF AND HE'S AN AMAZING

395
00:15:14,596 --> 00:15:14,930
PERSON.

396
00:15:14,930 --> 00:15:16,832
>> IT'S EASY FOR THE WHITE HOUSE

397
00:15:16,832 --> 00:15:19,668
TO SAY THAT WAS UNFORTUNATE, WE

398
00:15:19,668 --> 00:15:20,035
APOLOGIZE.

399
00:15:20,035 --> 00:15:22,871
THEY ARE GOING THROUGH A TRYING

400
00:15:22,871 --> 00:15:23,171
TIME.

401
00:15:23,171 --> 00:15:24,706
>> CALL THEM.

402
00:15:24,706 --> 00:15:26,141
LET'S NOT TRY --

403
00:15:26,141 --> 00:15:29,978
>> SHE CALLED MEGAN McCAIN.

404
00:15:29,978 --> 00:15:31,914
SARAH NEEDS TO SAY SOMETHING

405
00:15:31,914 --> 00:15:32,981
FROM THE PODIUM.

406
00:15:32,981 --> 00:15:35,717
>> WE HAVE POLICY DISAGREEMENTS

407
00:15:35,717 --> 00:15:37,786
WITH MSNBC.

408
00:15:37,786 --> 00:15:40,155
HE CALLS THE PRESIDENT AND ACTS

409
00:15:40,155 --> 00:15:42,624
LIKE HE HAS THE MORAL HIGH

410
00:15:42,624 --> 00:15:42,958
GROUND.

411
00:15:42,958 --> 00:15:45,394
SAME THING FOR NICOLE AND THESE

412
00:15:45,394 --> 00:15:47,763
PEOPLE WHO ATTACK ALL OF US

413
00:15:47,763 --> 00:15:49,765
REPUBLICAN WHOSE STAND WITH THE

414
00:15:49,765 --> 00:15:50,132
PRESIDENT.

415
00:15:50,132 --> 00:15:52,034
>> IT'S DIFFERENT WHEN IT COMES

416
00:15:52,034 --> 00:15:53,101
FROM THE WHITE HOUSE.

417
00:15:53,101 --> 00:15:54,970
YOU USED TO WORK THERE.

418
00:15:54,970 --> 00:15:58,674
>> MY WIFE WORKS THERE, AND I

419
00:15:58,674 --> 00:16:01,276
DON'T THINK YOU SHOULD SMUDGE

420
00:16:01,276 --> 00:16:02,177
THE CHARACTERS.

421
00:16:02,177 --> 00:16:04,346
>> I'M NOT.

422
00:16:04,346 --> 00:16:06,648
THEY ARE SMUDGING THEIR OWN

423
00:16:06,648 --> 00:16:07,215
CHARACTERS.

424
00:16:07,215 --> 00:16:09,084
>> Laura: MOCKING PEOPLE'S FACE,

425
00:16:09,084 --> 00:16:16,258
IF IT WERE DONE AGAINST ANIS

426
00:16:16,258 --> 00:16:18,193
ISLAMIC INDIVIDUAL, MIKE PENCE

427
00:16:18,193 --> 00:16:20,395
HAS BEEN MOCKED REPEATEDLY BY

428
00:16:20,395 --> 00:16:22,698
THE POPULAR CULTURE THAT ARE

429
00:16:22,698 --> 00:16:24,766
FANS AND FANATICS OF THE LEFT.

430
00:16:24,766 --> 00:16:27,135
IT'S BEEN TOLERATED, IT'S A WINK

431
00:16:27,135 --> 00:16:28,637
AND NOD.

432
00:16:28,637 --> 00:16:31,273
THEY THINK CHRISTIANS ARE

433
00:16:31,273 --> 00:16:31,707
STUPID.

434
00:16:31,707 --> 00:16:34,643
ANYONE WHO SUPPORTS TRUMP IS AN

435
00:16:34,643 --> 00:16:35,110
IDIOT.

436
00:16:35,110 --> 00:00:00,000
I THINK IT'S BACKFIRING.
