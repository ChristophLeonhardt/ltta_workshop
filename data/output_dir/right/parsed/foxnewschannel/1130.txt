>> NEW DETAIL UNCOVERS LINK TO
THE IRAN NUCLEAR DEAL.
THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION GREEN
LIGHTED IRANIAN ACCESS TO THE
U.S. BANKING SYSTEM AND WOULD
HAVE ALLOWED THE TRANSFER OF
BILLIONS THERE'S AMERICAN
INSTITUTIONS.
THIS FELT LIKE A BOMB SHELL TO
ME.
>> IRAN HAD ACCESS TO A NUMBER
OF BANK ACCOUNTS AROUND THE
WORLD BECAUSE OF THE IRAN
NUCLEAR DEAL.
BUT THEY HAD A PROBLEM WITH THIS
ONE BANK ACCOUNT IN OMAN.
THEY HAD $6 BILLION THERE AND
THE MONEY WAS IN LOCAL CURRENCY.
IF THEY WANTED THE MONEY, THEY
WOULD HAVE TO CONVERT IT TO
EUROS OR DOLLARS.
SO THE UNITED STATES WITH THE
OBAMA ADMINISTRATION GRANTED A
LICENSE TO ESSENTIALLY HELP OUT
IRAN, ALLOW IT TO DIVERT THE
MONEY THROUGH A U.S. BANK AND
CONVERT IT TO EUROS EVEN THOUGH
OFFICIALS WOULD SAY THAT THEY
WEREN'T GOING TO ALLOW THEM TO
DO THAT.
>> THE IRANIANS WANTED ACCESS TO
THE U.S. FINANCIAL SYSTEM.
I THINK THEY WERE MAKING THAT A
CONDITION FOR THE AGREEMENT, FOR
THE FINAL AGREEMENT.
AND SO ALTHOUGH THEY WERE SAYING
TO THE CONGRESS, THE OFFICIALS
AT THE TREASURY DEPARTMENT THAT
THERE WAS NO ACCESS, IN FACT
THEY GRANTED A SPECIFIC LICENSE
TO HAVE ACCESS TO THE SYSTEM.
>> A FORMER ADMINISTRATION
OFFICIAL REFUSED TO GO ON THE
RECORD AND TELLS US THE LICENSE
FULFILLED ACCESS TO LET IRAN GET
THE MONEY OVERSEAS.
THE LICENSE CANNOT BE DESCRIBED
AS GIVING ACCESS TO THE U.S.
FINANCIAL SYSTEM.
THE REPORT SAYS THAT IRAN NEVER
TOOK ADVANTAGE OF THIS BECAUSE
THE U.S. PUSHED TWO BANKS TO
EXECUTE THE DEAL AND THE BANKS
REFUSED BECAUSE THEY DIDN'T WANT
TO DO BUSINESS WITH IRAN.
EVENTUALLY IRAN GOT THE MONEY
