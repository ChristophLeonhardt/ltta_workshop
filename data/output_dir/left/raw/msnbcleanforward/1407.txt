HAS FAULTED THE PROSECUTION ON SEVERAL OCCASIONS FOR MAKING

00:01:39,233 --> 00:01:41,426
SEVERAL OCCASIONS FOR MAKING FACIAL EXPRESSIONS AND SO FORTH

38
00:01:41,469 --> 00:01:49,266
FACIAL EXPRESSIONS AND SO FORTH SO THEY’RE MORE STATE THAN

39
00:01:49,277 --> 00:01:49,566
SO THEY’RE MORE STATE THAN USUAL.

40
00:01:49,577 --> 00:01:51,302
USUAL. WE HEARD THE PROSECUTOR SAY HE

41
00:01:51,312 --> 00:01:54,205
WE HEARD THE PROSECUTOR SAY HE WAS HAPPY BECAUSE THEY WERE ABLE

42

WEREN’T TRYING TO PREPARE FOR THE NEXT DAY’S TESTIMONY.

45
00:01:57,918 --> 00:01:59,376
THE NEXT DAY’S TESTIMONY. I THINK THE QUESTIONS THAT CAME

46
00:01:59,387 --> 00:02:00,912
I THINK THE QUESTIONS THAT CAME IN ON THURSDAY HAD TO BE

47
00:02:00,922 --> 00:02:01,812
IN ON THURSDAY HAD TO BE UNSETTLING FOR THE PROSECUTION

48
00:02:01,856 --> 00:02:02,913
UNSETTLING FOR THE PROSECUTION IF THEY THOUGHT MAYBE THEY WOULD

49
00:02:02,924 --> 00:02:04,615
IF THEY THOUGHT MAYBE THEY WOULD GET A VERDICT HERE WITHIN A

50
00:02:04,626 --> 00:02:07,084
GET A VERDICT HERE WITHIN A MATTER OF A FEW HOURS THAT THIS

51
00:02:07,128 --> 00:02:11,122
MATTER OF A FEW HOURS THAT THIS CASE WAS A SLAM DUNK.

52
00:02:11,132 --> 00:02:11,789
CASE WAS A SLAM DUNK. SOME OF THEM SUGGESTED THAT

53
00:02:11,799 --> 00:02:12,824
SOME OF THEM SUGGESTED THAT JURORS WANT TO POUR THROUGH THIS

54
00:02:12,867 --> 00:02:14,025
JURORS WANT TO POUR THROUGH THIS EVIDENCE IN DETAIL AND THAT WE

55
00:02:14,035 --> 00:02:20,965
EVIDENCE IN DETAIL AND THAT WE COULD BE HERE A WHILE I THINK

56
00:02:21,008 --> 00:02:22,533
COULD BE HERE A WHILE I THINK THE DEFENSE MAY BE OVERSTATING

57
00:02:22,576 --> 00:02:24,802
THE DEFENSE MAY BE OVERSTATING BUT I THINK THE PROSECUTION HAS

58
00:02:24,846 --> 00:02:25,703
BUT I THINK THE PROSECUTION HAS SOME REASONS TO BE CONCERNED.

59
00:02:25,714 --> 00:02:27,104
SOME REASONS TO BE CONCERNED. >> WE SHOWED THE PRESIDENT

60

ATTORNEY SAYING HE WAS HAPPY THE PRESIDENT DID THAT.

00:02:33,154 --> 00:02:35,613
PRESIDENT DID THAT. ALSO OUR OWN PETER ALEXANDER

ALSO OUR OWN PETER ALEXANDER ASKED THE PRESIDENT ABOUT THE

66
00:02:38,660 --> 00:02:39,450
ASKED THE PRESIDENT ABOUT THE POSSIBILITY IF THERE’S A

67
00:02:39,461 --> 00:02:43,120
POSSIBILITY IF THERE’S A CONVICTION OF A PARDON FOR PAUL

68

00:02:50,304 --> 00:02:51,395
>> I DON’T TALK ABOUT THAT CHLT. >> THE PRESIDENT DIDN’T WANT TO

73
00:02:51,439 --> 00:02:52,964
>> THE PRESIDENT DIDN’T WANT TO TALK ABOUT IT BUT THE COMMENTS

74
00:02:53,007 --> 00:02:54,132
TALK ABOUT IT BUT THE COMMENTS HAVE PEOPLE TALKING ABOUT IT.

75
00:02:54,175 --> 00:02:56,234
HAVE PEOPLE TALKING ABOUT IT. >> WELL, THE PRESIDENT HAS I

76
00:02:56,244 --> 00:02:58,937
>> WELL, THE PRESIDENT HAS I THINK ABUSED HIS PARDON POWER

77
00:02:58,947 --> 00:03:01,373
THINK ABUSED HIS PARDON POWER WHICH IS I ADMIT COMPLETELY

78
00:03:01,383 --> 00:03:05,076
WHICH IS I ADMIT COMPLETELY UNLIMITED BUT IT’S PERHAPS TIME

79
00:03:05,087 --> 00:03:08,446
UNLIMITED BUT IT’S PERHAPS TIME FOR A CONSTITUTIONAL LOOK AT

80
00:03:08,456 --> 00:03:08,846
FOR A CONSTITUTIONAL LOOK AT THAT.

81
00:03:08,857 --> 00:03:10,548
THAT. BECAUSE WITHOUT ANY RESTRICTIONS

82
00:03:10,559 --> 00:03:12,884
BECAUSE WITHOUT ANY RESTRICTIONS ON HIM HE HAS PARDONED PEOPLE

83
00:03:12,927 --> 00:03:14,319
ON HIM HE HAS PARDONED PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN HELD IN CONTEMPT

84
00:03:14,362 --> 00:03:14,986
WHO HAVE BEEN HELD IN CONTEMPT OF COURT.

85
00:03:15,029 --> 00:03:17,088
OF COURT. HE HAS PARDONED PEOPLE WHO HAVE

86
00:03:17,098 --> 00:03:20,391
HE HAS PARDONED PEOPLE WHO HAVE VIOLATED VERY SERIOUS LAWS.

87
00:03:20,402 --> 00:03:22,661
VIOLATED VERY SERIOUS LAWS. AND I DON’T KNOW THAT HE WOULD

88
00:03:22,704 --> 00:03:24,796
AND I DON’T KNOW THAT HE WOULD PARDON ANYONE HERE BECAUSE IT

89
00:03:24,839 --> 00:03:26,197
PARDON ANYONE HERE BECAUSE IT DOESN’T DO HIM -- THAT IS DONALD

90
00:03:26,208 --> 00:03:27,332
DOESN’T DO HIM -- THAT IS DONALD TRUMP -- ANY GOOD.

91
00:03:27,375 --> 00:03:28,800
TRUMP -- ANY GOOD. AND DONALD TRUMP SEEMS TO

92
00:03:28,810 --> 00:03:32,771
AND DONALD TRUMP SEEMS TO PROTECT MOSTLY HIMSELF.

93
00:03:32,781 --> 00:03:34,372
PROTECT MOSTLY HIMSELF. THE PAUL MANAFORT WERE PARDONED

94
00:03:34,383 --> 00:03:39,411
THE PAUL MANAFORT WERE PARDONED HE WOULD HAVE TO TESTIFY.

95
00:03:39,454 --> 00:03:41,313
HE WOULD HAVE TO TESTIFY. HE COULD NOT AVOID THAT, HE

96
00:03:41,323 --> 00:03:44,449
HE COULD NOT AVOID THAT, HE WOULD LOSE HIS FIFTH AMENDMENT

97
00:03:44,493 --> 00:03:46,184
WOULD LOSE HIS FIFTH AMENDMENT PRIVILEGE AND THAT WOULD BE A

98
00:03:46,195 --> 00:03:46,985
PRIVILEGE AND THAT WOULD BE A PROBLEM FOR DONALD TRUMP.

99
00:03:46,995 --> 00:03:49,321
PROBLEM FOR DONALD TRUMP. NOW IT’S TRUE THAT DONALD TRUMP

100
00:03:49,331 --> 00:03:50,088
NOW IT’S TRUE THAT DONALD TRUMP PARDONED JOE ARPAIO SO HE COULD

101
00:03:50,098 --> 00:03:53,291
PARDONED JOE ARPAIO SO HE COULD DO THE SAME IN THIS CASE IF

102
00:03:53,302 --> 00:03:59,831
DO THE SAME IN THIS CASE IF MANAFORT REFUSES TO TESTIFY BUT

103
00:03:59,842 --> 00:04:01,099
MANAFORT REFUSES TO TESTIFY BUT I THINK THE REPUBLICANS WILL

104
00:04:01,109 --> 00:04:02,500
I THINK THE REPUBLICANS WILL GROW A SPINE AND THEY WILL SAY

105
00:04:02,511 --> 00:04:04,236
GROW A SPINE AND THEY WILL SAY ENOUGH IS ENOUGH AND WE CAN’T

106
00:04:04,246 --> 00:04:05,604
ENOUGH IS ENOUGH AND WE CAN’T LET HIM KEEP GOING THIS WAY AND

107
00:04:05,614 --> 00:04:08,740
LET HIM KEEP GOING THIS WAY AND WE NEED TO GET THE TRUTH OUT SO

108
00:04:08,784 --> 00:04:10,375
WE NEED TO GET THE TRUTH OUT SO I DO AGREE WITH EVERYTHING JOSH

109
00:04:10,419 --> 00:04:18,150
I DO AGREE WITH EVERYTHING JOSH SAID EARLIER ABOUT THE CONCERNS.

110
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:19,451
SAID EARLIER ABOUT THE CONCERNS. I WOULD BE SHOCKED IF THERE WAS

111
00:04:19,461 --> 00:04:20,953
I WOULD BE SHOCKED IF THERE WAS A VERDICT BEFORE THREE OR FOUR

112
00:04:20,995 --> 00:04:21,252
A VERDICT BEFORE THREE OR FOUR DAYS.

113
00:04:21,262 --> 00:04:22,654
DAYS. THEY HAVE TO CONSIDER 18 COUNTS

114
00:04:22,665 --> 00:00:00,000
THEY HAVE TO CONSIDER 18 COUNTS AND JURIES TAKE THEIR
