peace in the magazines upcoming issue is a deep dive into the dossier compiled by former British spy Christopher Steele on President Donald Trump's ties with Russia in the peace chain writes in part this in conversations with friends Christopher Steele said he hoped that in five years he'd look back and laugh at the whole experience but he tended toward pessimism no matter how the drama turned out I will take this to my grave he often predicted a longtime friend of Steel's pointed out to me that Steele was in a singularly unenviable predicament the dossier had infuriated both Vladimir Putin and Donald Trump by divulging allegedly corrupt dealings between them you've got oligarchs running both superpowers the friend said and incredibly they both hate this same guy that would kind of be a bummer it's kind of a bummer his life is sort of a mess and Ally yeah thanks to American politics really so I mean I think that you know one of the things that really surprised me I was trying to figure out so did he tell the truth or is he part of some conspiracy to work with Hillary Clinton to bring you know Trump down and and the the truth he's really kind of a whistleblower who totally believed what he was saying and he kept trying to get people he was saying the Russians are coming the Russians are coming and contrary to the conspiracy theories mostly no one listened as particularly I mean he went he went to the FBI and they kind of dragged their feet he went to the State Department he went is looking up there he went to the FBI and actually was frustrated because the FBI kept putting it on the back burner except I didn't the FBI move on this faster regarding the Russian part of it it was you know I have to say having been one of the reporters backgrounded by him when still did finally meet with reporters very late in the game it was so hard to believe there was a Russian conspiracy or or that this story could be true and it was also it also was very complicated it there's a lot of criminology it was it took there was a big learning curve in this country and and the thing is he's a Russian expert and before he wrote that dossier he was he'd written a big study of Russian meddling in other Western elections so he was very aware of the possibility of what could happen and what might be coming our way Jay and his work has now obviously been completely politicized and you've even seen Republican senators chuck Grassley and Lindsey Graham refer him for criminal prosecution the Department of Justice arguing that he committed a crime in line to the FBI I'm curious how does he feel about this now having done what I assumed he thought was kind of a service to the United States and trying to to reveal what he knew about Donald Trump and connections to Russians what does he feel about now being accused of being a criminal by politicians here I you know the thing is I did the first interview with anybody close to him his partner because he's not steals not allowed to talk but the partner explained what he thinks which is you know it's been shocking to him it's completely he feels he has tried to been a loyal ally to the United States for 30 years first working with mi6 sharing intelligence he did backgrounders for Michael Hayden he did a memo that was given done Russia to directly to Obama and and he feels that the Western alliance is incredibly important and he tried to warn them and he ends up being called a criminal Wow it's in cran and in the meantime since he first started talking about this so much of what he has suggested it happened has happened isn't it true I know I mean it piece by piece it's falling into place and it's not just we who feel this but the intelligence community is saying it so there are three top former intelligence people in this piece on the record saying so much of it is is it's looking stronger and truer by the day and the other thing that is in here is the first there's a there's a scene where Obama's briefed on this and Comey for the first time is revealed to say that this man is someone who we consider reliable we know his sources and sub sources we think they're rely Wow and his findings are consistent with what we see which bad so he worked for British and he worked for British intelligence and then now he's in this partisan game because the steel dossier was used by the Clinton ministration through the hyper-partisan but in your assessment is he Paul Revere or is he Benedict Donald well if you were an American I would say much closer to Paul Revere but the difference is he was actually instead of riding out on his horse and screaming in public he was working through channels because he's very he's a spy he was trying to do the right thing work quietly with the FBI at first quietly with the State Department and they just kept putting it in safes and not moving on it and you said he was so aware of the implications of what could happen and is did he on the lurid part of the dossier the sexual operations he was hesitant well his partner said to him do you really want to tell the country this you know you are going to be this is going to have be a problem if we go out and say that that the president is involved engaged in this kind of sexual activity but he's such a straight arrow his friends say that he said we can't cherry pick the intelligence right the information is the information it would distort it if you kept it out keep it in and thus we have the that that episode yeah well and again if we there's absolutely no verification of all of that though there had been other stories leading in a certain direction over the past couple months I have a question the question that I've never really figured out exactly whose idea was it to first start this who paid for it I you know we got you you had breaking news six months ago that conservative website the Washington I think free beacon had asked him to investigate some things about Trump and then we had heard that supporters of Marco Rubio had paid money for him to investigate things about Trump I don't think he was ever tied to Marcos pacifically but some people given Marco money during the primary and then we heard during the general election it was Hillary Clinton's campaign that was funding this what what's what's the true story it starts with the free beacon which is run by or largely controlled and owned by Paul singer a New York financier who doesn't like is he's a conservative he's a Republican but he didn't like Trump right and he was hoping to find dirt that would take down Trump from the from the right from from the Republicans so that's where the dossier began actually it's it's where the investigation began but it's really when Hillary came on that the firm that was doing that investigation fusion GPS then hired they they then hired steel so he'd but he did not know he was working for the Hillary campaign for a couple months he knew he figured he's not an idiot he figured he was working for Democrats trying to take down Trump but he didn't know for sure but he did tell the FBI right away I think this is probably political you know this is coming out of political my campaign is my client is probably political he said but he wasn't going to change it my it was so not in his in his interest to slant it because he's in business trying to sell the excellence of his reporting his sources and if it were slanted and if he were making up facts whole cloth he wouldn't have gone to the Federal Bureau of Investigations saying information for you that's just what the intelligence community people I interviewed said they were very impressed they thought he had to have believed in himself or he wouldn't have subjected it to the FBI right that's a good way to the truth former Trump administration you would never have an apple guy in a political campaign go to the FBI then like that what happened because you're just asking for trouble lying to the FBI at any time right and some bad thing his firm had gone to the FBI he had worked with the FBI on a number of investigations in the past and his firm had also gone to German authorities when they thought they were their former intelligence officers so they were trying to tip they were trying to tip off in there and explain again one more time really quick they missed it why didn't the FBI take him seriously at first I I don't know they haven't answered there are still a lot of unanswered questions you know who I think is going to figure out the bottom line on all this is is the Special Counsel robert muller because he can subpoena that records and get bank records and travel records and that'll be the final verdict i think it's a new yorkers jane mayer thank you thank you very much as well as mika both similar problems with your chickens if only we have birds we die but i said this morning when I heard you talking about chance I
