joining me right now is Sean Shaw he is running for Florida Attorney General in what should be an interesting and perhaps close race in Florida obviously the governor's race they're also very important interesting and potentially close so Sean welcome to the program hey I'm happy to be here thanks for having me yeah absolutely so you have what I would view to be great proposals if you win I want to get to those soon but first I want to talk to your opponent about your opponent a little bit Ashlee moody so she's backing Pam Bondi who has been at term-limited out here Pam Bondi well-known despicable character in national politics unfortunately in my opinion from Florida her defense of abortion restrictions passed by the legislature she wants to join the lawsuit to destroy Obamacare but you know I get it she's a terrible Republican who isn't but the part that still gets me is and I know that this should be just as obvious but I still I have trouble believing so she still supports stand your ground she looks to stand your ground in the state of Florida thinks this is working really well is it is that really the case that's really the case I'm at a loss just like you are Republicans seem to be so slow to react to this cycle that is a poem and you're right I mean I was one of the people that was at the church when we had the parents and al Sharpton and a bunch of other people and we worshiped and called for a change in the stand-your-ground laws and you know we had five people running for governor at the time every single one of them showed up Republicans either were silent or they went back in there in our very cages and said yeah we support stand your ground and listen I don't know if your viewers have seen it I've seen the video many times with brother Marquis McLaughlin getting gunned down in a Clearwater gas station parking lot for doing nothing more than standing up for his family and that's wrong and I'll do everything I can to repeal that law yeah yeah I know we showed it over and over again right people getting gunned down when there was absolutely no need it's sickening so now let's talk about what you would do if you win as Attorney General now there's a couple of issues that you work you would work on that would be very relevant to the national stage I want to get the Trump in a second but first off you have as your number one priority going after the pharmaceutical companies so right well why and to just tell us more about that being here in Florida as in a lot of states the pharmaceutical industry has simply flooded Florida with opioids and not only have they flooded them with opioids the marketing behind those opioids are often false deceptive claiming that they're not habit-forming and have led to really an opioid crisis here in Florida in other places one of the few things that I would continue that pam body has done was that lawsuit there's been a lawsuit filed against big pharma to go after them for this opioid crisis I would continue to do that but you've probably hit on the only thing that I would continue that Pam Bondi has done yeah and and I think that there's also differences in degree in how aggressively can go after the pharmaceutical companies and exactly I mean that's one of the cases we make in this race is look I tend to be the most aggressive Attorney General in the country that's what I'm running to be I'm not ready to be anything less and I'm pretty transparent with that and I tell people in mixed audiences wherever I speak Florida you elect me you're gonna get an aggressive attorney general if you don't want that then maybe I'm not your guy but when I'm around talking to people and the numbers and all the feelings we have here on the ground people want a change they want someone that is aggressive and they want someone that's gonna hold everyone accountable yeah it's about protecting people's lives opioid deaths spiked by over thirty five percent in just 2016 in Florida so yeah and and that's what an Attorney General's supposed to do protect the citizens of the state so now there's also issues of criminal justice reform so it talked to us about your different stances on on the issues involved with same criminal justice reform look when I say that I am for criminal justice reform I mean everything I mean bail reform I mean bandits minimums I mean how are we charged juveniles as adults how we ought to be really trying to have people go to substance abuse rather than just lock them up our jails in Florida and I bet other places around the country just full of people with nothing but simple possession charges we've got to do something about it and quite frankly I've got to make the legislature change some laws here in Florida and hopefully we could work with the next democratic governor that done - Florida is in for some wonderful changes in a lot of ways this is simply one of them I was talking to the audience early today and I said if you believe in criminal justice reform you will elect Democrats at the top of the ticket because we are the ones that will get it done Republicans have been in charge here in Florida 20 years they talk about criminal justice reform I have seen none of it yet I'm a member of the state legislature we've done nothing on criminal justice reform it will not happen until we elect different people regardless of the speeches and pontification and wonderful flowery language you hear nothing has happened here in Florida and it won't until we elect different people so you've got a variety of interesting people backing you move on is banging you , Harris moms demand action the Miami Herald they've endorsed you correct we've gotten the Miami Herald we've gotten the sun-sentinel we've gotten the Palm Beach Post we've gotten a lot of newspapers look this is these are different things on the ground here in Florida these are different times this is not normal what you're seeing on the ground here in Florida is simply nothing short of amazing I mean I was in Flagler County last night and the room was packed and for your listeners and viewers Flagler County I didn't know had that many Democrats and so everywhere we go the energy on the ground is amazing I've been a Democrat in Florida I have born and raised in Florida I have never seen anything like this times are changing the people of Florida want something different than what they've had and I'm just glad to be a part of it representatives show when Rick DeSantis now made that infamous comment about how the people of Florida should not monkey around with the race given that Andrew Gilliam his opponent is African American do you think that that Wanda backfiring on them that it's energized a lot of people to show up to the polls absolutely a black man is nominated governor and in less than 12 hours our racial comment is made of course that has motivated us but it's not just that it's 20 years of that it's 20 years of that compounded by Trump who is the worst of the worst but let me also say this politicians are very careful with what we say politicians know every word that come out of their mouth is parsed and looked over and if you think monkey around was an accident then you and I disagree it was on purpose it was a dog whistle and it's straight out of the PlayBook of Donald Trump that's what he does that's how he won he won by dividing us and we're gonna take it back by uniting those against him uniting good people to back up what the American Dream is and we're gonna win in Florida because we've got a vision for people of what to vote for not just what to vote against yeah represent oh sure I am gonna disagree with you a little bit it was not a dog whistle it was a human whistle it was clear as day and and I said on the show immediately that was on purpose they thought it's gonna motivate their own voters who they believe apparently are racist to come up and show show up and vote for them but I think he miscalculated I think there's a lot more good people in Florida than there are the people who was trying to appeal to so but I you brought up Trump this is very important in your particular race Trump has a lot of businesses in Florida I'm not overly convinced that he's been handling them above board would you be investigating his businesses if you became Florida Attorney General that's the greatest question we've got today man of course we've made a huge point of the fact that it is illegal to personally profit from the presidency steam arguments Clause the United States Constitution the Democratic Attorney General's in Washington DC and in Maryland have filed suit that suit has survived several procedural attacks and it's still going on Florida will be the next state to join the minute I'm elected and there's Mar Lago in Florida there's Trump Towers and there's a myriad of businesses and charitable organizations there's questions about how those charities are paying funds that aren't necessarily charitable in Trump's case we are absolutely gonna do that and listen we're gonna do it because as Attorney General I'm gonna go after anyone that's doing wrong no matter who you are or where you are and we're gonna get to the bottom of whether the president is profiting from the presidency yeah I it's maddening to the average citizen to see that there are some folks who appear to be too big to jail and and when too often in this country when Attorney General's talk about crime they only mean physical crime or a blue-collar crime but they never talk about white-collar crime wouldn't it be great to have an attorney general that represents everybody and goes after every kind of crime you listen my background politically and personally is that I've been a consumer advocate all of my life all I've done are represent working families and work and represent consumers against big corporate interests that's what I've done all my life that's why this race is kind of how its unfolded that's why I'm getting attacked pretty heavily by you know who it's because I think they understand that I'm gonna hold everyone accountable I've said there's no need to be scared of an attorney general Shan Shan if you're doing right if you're not doing anything wrong you're not gonna hear from me but if you are doing something wrong I don't care how big you are what kind of company you are where you are you are going to hear from me and that's how an attorney general oughta act this is not the office for someone that doesn't have political courage this is not the office if you don't want to be aggressive this is not the office if you want to get along with everybody and all of those things I've made clear we intend to use this office to the as much power as it contains to go after people doing wrong yeah music to my ears it might be Florida but winter and Shawn Shaw are coming at least the wrongdoers all right everybody the website is Shawn
