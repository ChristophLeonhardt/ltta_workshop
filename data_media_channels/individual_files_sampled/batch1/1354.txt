an early morning bugle call summons revelers onto the streets of Recife it's called the rooster of the dawn the highlight of Carnaval in northeastern Brazil is capital where at least a million people parade past the giant bird we wait for Carnaval all year it's something spectacular that's in all of our hearts here in Pernambuco where we hear and dance the rhythm of our region above all the fribble genre where brass band music is accompanied by an acrobatic dance in a massive street party where Brazilians can forget their economic and political woes its culture roots joy for our people who've been suffering so much lately Carnival lasts for five days a period of unbridled revelry ending just before Lent which on the Christian calendar marks a 40 day period of fasting and prayer since it first began here in the 1800s the crowds of people huddle away to clear the way from the back to the mansion after the emancipation of slavery and until this day it's become a massive outdoor affair it's a carnival made up of so many diverse people that just want to have fun unlike in Rio where lavish samba schools spend millions of dollars often from questionable sources here it's all grassroots every neighborhood in household comes out to parade no one's too young or too old to celebrate resumes most traditional carnival you see a human are JC de Recife Brazil
