Seven billion people inhabit
planet Earth, and their fates
rest in the hands
of these two men.
“Uh, they will
be doing things.
And, uh, I think he
wants to do things.
I think he wants to, uh, we’ll be
doing something on it.”
What if we’ve been
overthinking foreign policy
all along?
And what the world really
needed was a movie trailer?
No, really.
This actually happened.
Trump made a fake
movie trailer
to deal with an
actual nuclear threat.
“I showed it to
him today, and I
think he loved it.”
From the administration who
tanked the Iran nuclear
deal, which eliminated
98% of Iran’s enriched
uranium, comes an epic mash-up
of stock footage.
Like these horses running through water.
This guy dunking and
this girl in a field.
Donald Trump plays
the Dotard,
and Kim Jong un is Rocket
Man.
In his performance, Trump doesn’t hold back.
Suspending military
exercises with South Korea.
“I think it’s inappropriate
to be having war games.”
As for Kim’s performance,
he gives... nothing,
really, because he
made no concessions.
Nothing about a timetable
for denuclearization
or verification
or even destroying
intercontinental
ballistic missiles.
“Can you ensure anything?
Can I ensure that you’re
going to be able to sit down
properly when you sit down?
I mean, you can’t
ensure anything.”
But look at this cloud.
And this guy doing VR.
And this really fast train.
Many people are saying this
could be a Nobel Prize-
winning performance.
New York Times says, “Holy , I
can’t believe this is real.”
Critics are raving, “What about
Kim Jong-un’s human rights
violations and these
concentration camps?”
But look at these fast boats.
Machu Picchu, and
these beautiful condos
on the beach.
“You see that whenever they
are exploding their cannons
into the ocean.
I said, ‘Boy, look at that.
Wouldn‘t that make a
great condo?’”
Coming to North Korea on a
smuggled thumb drive soon.
“Really, he’s got
a great personality.
He’s a, you know, funny guy.
He’s a very smart guy.
He’s a great negotiator.
