Rhys recorded down so this guy has been
out here for the past forty minutes
he always kicking more snow off the back
he's been doing this from there it's
absolutely absurd
I don't we didn't think he's even worked
off the back window looking what's who
ever kick a bit of snow eh I should be
able to make it up the whole Hill you
just know that if it was a survival
situation for mankind he'd be the first
to snuff it I was like you could just do
this backwards would you go back
backwards again I don't if I'm gonna
take from this he's just snuffed up he's
even gone the pavement so sorry it's not
conduit for the road he's gone under
with the right and a half what I
probably did stop the video in a minute
and if you just put us on the P you
pretty much experience in exactly what
we are
oh look he's actually making it worse
over there look at that that's insane
they recognized the device all day Oh
having cold conditions the next three
weeks madness this has been there so
long that it is just blew up again
is that yeah at least the windows going
guys are just worked out we're not going
anywhere it will be out in five minutes
after break and some collection of
thoughts it's hilarious
it really is I love how he's Park now he
wasn't on the side the road where he was
before just there well there he's now in
the middle of the road at corner
yeah he's breaking another car
and track vehicle oh my word
pretty well that shit you know the
reality is that's my car
and there's no way it's going to work
today after that he'll lose
