obviously your your prominence has just blown up in the last year and a half we were talking before the show about why that is and why there are so many people who suddenly are very angry about you I notice there's an article in Politico suggesting that young angry white males you are now their their leader so congratulations oh you have I want to ask you about that why do you think that number one your profiles become so big of late and number two why do you think it is that so many members of the of the left are so angry about that why are they characterizing people who listen to you as angry and enraged young white well we could we can look at the characterization to begin with you know because I think it speaks to the pathology of the radical left instantly they're absolutely incapable of viewing the world except through group identity terms you know and so if someone comes out and disagrees with them then they have to characterize them by their fundamental group attribute whatever that happens to be maybe its gender because that's a favorite or maybe it's race and so angry white men young there we go sexist ageist and racist all at once right they're angry young white men well it has to be that way if you're going to be the if you're gonna play the leftist game because that's the only way that you can look at the world and then if you can't make your opponent reprehensible in some manner and it's strange that they would attempt to make them reprehensible on the grounds of race age and sex since that's precisely what they stand against hypothetically but if you can't make your enemy reprehensible along some dimension then you have to contend with them seriously and so you know if I'm not an all right fascist like Hitler you know or Milo you know Phyllis which was how I was characterized in Canada because the radical leftist can't even get their bloody insults straight he's like Hitler or Milo you know Alice it's like because there's no difference between them right no obvious difference it's just another attempt to Hillary as far as I can tell
