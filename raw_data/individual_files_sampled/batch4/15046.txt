the winners of president Trump's 2017 fake news awards have been announced we're gonna run through them we're gonna see what he left out and we're gonna contrast their fake news against his real-world successes all right the winners of the 2017 fake news Awards are here I was expected CNN had a really strong showing but I think a couple were left out let's run through them number one the New York Times Paul Krugman he claimed that when Trump was elected the economy would never recover businesses are doing incredibly well Apple is investing nearly half a billion dollars in creating 22,000 jobs the Dow smashed 26,000 the Nasdaq 7,000 make news Paul Krugman you deserve your award number two ABC News's Brian Ross chokes and sentence markets in a downward spiral after a fake news report on Russia illusion what needs to be said Brian Ross was essentially suspended from ABC demoted but shamed globally which was the best part of all or fake news well-deserved award number three CNN falsely reported that Donald Trump then candidate Donald Trump and his son Donald Trump jr. false had access to hacked documents from WikiLeaks before they were publicly released thereby proving collusion between the Trump campaign and WikiLeaks WikiLeaks that's alleged to be in collusion with the Russian government except the information was false and this all stemmed from a Donald Trump jr. tweet that the left said came it was about WikiLeaks information they claimed that he tweeted it before WikiLeaks publicly released the info a quick google search proved they were wrong it was fake news they never vetted it they just wanted to attack Donald Trump jr. ran with the story didn't get the story and for that they get a well-deserved well-earned fake news award number four time falsely reported that President Trump removed the bust of Martin luther king jr from The Oval Office never happened fake news again they never researched it never sourced it never vetted it and they were very silent when Barack Obama actually removed a bust of Winston Churchill number five Washington Post falsely reported the president's massive sold-out rally in Pensacola Florida was empty Dave Weigel from The Washington Post took a photo hours before Trump got there and hours before the doors were opened for the general public and then while the rally was going on or even afterward he posted photos of the empty arena that wasn't yet open as from the rally while it was ongoing now I had this happen to me in South Florida I debunked a Reuters reporter I believe she was from Reuters she did the same thing at the route at the rally here in Broward County in South Florida we as press got in much earlier I was sitting in the area and this woman was sitting off to my left I little have figured that out from the picture she later released when they opened the doors it was packed there had to be ten twelve thousand people there and it was even more impressive because it was a torrential parental South Florida rain storm the Ramon's coming down in buckets there was about six inches of water on the ground the arena was still full people were energized to see Donald Trump and later that day while I was in the arena the BB&T center big venue here concerts or hockey teams play there she put these photos up and I was checking Twitter I saw them I was at the venue sitting just to her right I mean I don't know about 50 60 feet to her right I put up my own photos tagged her and she started to backpedal that she was at a bad angle and the section she shot was actually a section that wasn't open and it was her mistake no she was trying to say that a packed rally was empty we thoroughly thoroughly debunked her thank God my photo my tweet went viral but the mainstream media's been doing this Washington Post earns the award Dave Weigel personally should have been named in this one though number six this was a great one you remember this one CNN falsely edited a video to make it appear that President Trump defiantly overfed fish during a visit to Japan well it was actually japan's Prime Minister Abe that started feeding the fish as much food but think about how stupid this was in addition to CNN deceptively editing the video and taking out the parts with the Japanese Prime Minister also feeding the fish they were really trying to paint a narrative that Donald Trump is a guy who indiscriminately wants to overfeed a koi pond and kill the fish I mean there Trump derangement syndrome is so out of control but the stuff they come up with it hit the president is now just bizarre number seven it's a great one CNN falsely reported that Anthony scaramouche is meeting with a Russian thief also important about Anthony scaramouche he's meeting with a Russian but retracted it due to a significant breakdown in process reseeding employees that resign over this one and what they fail to mention in this piece is that scaramouche II is suing them for a hundred million bucks that you would think if somebody sued you for a hundred million bucks I know I would I'm gonna sue me for a hundred million bucks for me falling down on the job I'd probably stop falling down on the job but no CNN doubles down they continue the fake news they don't care about these these nine figure lawsuits that they'll probably lose they're so hell-bent on destroying Trump that they're willing to run their whole network into the ground to do it number eight Newsweek falsely reported that Polish first lady I'll get at kornhauser Duda did not chick president Trump's hands and you remember this they used a bunch of photos showing the first lady not shaking his hand but failed to use the photo vividly and clearly showing the First Lady of Poland shaking president Trump's hand that's not deceptive selective editing and an editorial process that is bias against the president I don't know what it what is photo existed of her shaking his hand they chose not to use it they created a story it never happened when they had photo evidence that it did in some cultures they call that lying the media lies I know you can't believe it but they do number nine as CN n falsely reported that FBI director James Comey would dispute president Trump's claim that he was told he is not under an investigation not only was it fake news homie in fact did tell President Trump he was not under investigation never retracted the claim CNN looked like absolute morons once again CNN looked like morons 1 number 10 the New York Times mostly claimed on the front page for the Trump administration had hidden a climate report while the Washington Post's had to run a headline New York Times guilty of large screw-up on climate change story so when fake news Washington Post is debunking the fake news New York Times it's just glorious I love watching the left eat each other number 11 last but not least the entire Russia collusion narrative ergo the entire mainstream media gets an award a fake news award for pushing a false Russia collusion narrative Donald Trump tweeted earlier this month well now that collusion with Russia is proven to be a total hoax and the only collusion is with Hillary and the FBI and Russia the fake news media mainstream media and this phony new book Wolf's book hitting out at every are hitting out at every new front imaginable they should try winning an election sad well that drove them nuts now while the fake news media was focused on fake failures of President Trump they ignored massive successes so let's go through those this is from the gops actual website the Republican National Committee's website number one the economy has created nearly 2 million jobs and gained over a trillion dollars in wealth the president's inauguration that'll be in addition to the four trillion dollars being repatriated in the hands of Americans and businesses due to tax reform in deregulation I'd call that a pretty big win I'd call that pretty significant wouldn't you mainstream media won't report on it I think that's that's pretty uh pretty good one for any administration they don't want to tell you about it number two African Americans and Hispanics are enjoying the lowest unemployment rate in history well they can't report on that cuz that debunks to hold Trump is a racist narrative Barack Obama african-american unemployment under Obama hit record highs the economy was a disaster Rumph is putting people of color back to work he's really failing as a racist isn't he man is the least racist person he sued they have moral hago integrated when he bought it he took on he took on the wealthiest of the wealthy and Palm Beach to have his club integrated it is a disgrace they called this man a racist number three the president signed historic historic tax cuts and relief for hardworking Americans not seen since Ronald Reagan and I'll combine number four with number three the president Trump's plan to cut regulations has exceeded the two out of every one mandate he's issuing 22d regulatory actions for every one regulatory action and I'll even add number three in there the president has unleashed an American energy boom by ending Obama era regulations approving the Keystone pipeline auctioning off millions of new acres for energy exploration and opening up an more and we're seeing the results in our economy well going back to work I was sitting with two very high net worth businesspeople last night they are making tons of investments in new projects in new companies and sectors they've never invested in before who men are about to create five hundred to a thousand jobs with their investments this is the evil 1% the evil greedy 1% they're not greedy at all these are kind philanthropic people we're getting people back to work that the engines of our economy and now they have increased capital to do it and one of these guys said to me his mantra in life is leaving people better off than he found them that pretty much debunked the less narrative of the evil 1% right he said I've been very fortunate I've made a lot of money I'm very wealthy I want to leave people better off than I found them if I can invest in these new businesses great concepts and I can put 500 a thousand people to work I'll be a very happy man sort of sort of really just crushes the evil one-percenter narrative the economy is doing so so well and Trump's policies Trump's policies are responsible number six Isis is crushed Obama said Isis was a multi-generational problem Trump crushed him at about nine months no more even needs to be said on that number seven Donald Trump followed through on his promise to recognize Jerusalem as the capitalist State of Israel and move the embassy or to the State Department move the embassy there a loud and clear message to bad actors in Middle East region that Israel is our ally they're our most important strategic partner we're gonna back them up they're gonna back us up and you're seeing the ripple effect now that region is starting to feel a little bit safer and I feel that we can add some stability I don't think I'll ever fully stabilize the Middle East but I feel that this renewed partnership with Israel after Obama treating them like garbage for eight years is going to strengthen the security of the region in the Middle East as a whole in Jordan has been a pretty good partner as well and if we could all work together and neutralize Iran and help the people protesting their form a new democratic government we've done more for the Middle East and the last four administration's combined number eight with president Trump's encouragement this one's a great one more member nations are paying their fair share for the common defense and the NATO alliance I remember during the election oh my god trump is asking NATO nations to pay or standing in the world is going to be crushed everybody's gonna exit NATO the u.s. is gonna go it alone we're all gonna die it's Armageddon when Trump told the NATO nations to pay their fair share you know what they said okay and they broke out their checkbooks and they paid Obama never asked Obama was the world's doormat he never asked them to pay their fair share now Trump's doing it with the UN they're gonna pay as well Obama instead sent billions to Iran so that they could build nukes with North Korea Trump steps and he says we're gonna end that and by the way you guys owe us money buck up pay us those nations said ok they signed the check they paid our NATO alliances have never been stronger Poland is thriving it's a frontline of Defense polling if Russia would ever get too aggressive I mean the world is so much safer under this administration number nine is really important find the veterans accountability and Whistleblower Protection Act to allow senior officials in the VA the fire failing employees and it establishes safeguards to protect whistleblowers we owe no greater debt to anyone than we do our veterans young guys in their 20s coming home losing limbs eyes traumatic brain injuries post-traumatic stress disorder and the VA was a mess well now under this act people can be fired people are being held accountable whistleblowers now have protection and you talk to any veteran there's they'll tell you it's still bad but it's getting better it's getting better and and I think that this should be I know every American agrees with me it's not what I think I know every American agrees with me and I would I would agree that our or Canadian friends agree with me as well because you have your own veterans coming back from this conflict we owe our veterans everything for the sacrifices they and their families give our nation's their health care their their post trauma treatment when they come home should be a pleasure for them not the hell it currently is at the VA and president Trump is finally doing something about that and that was long long overdue we need to do much much more number 10 President Trump kept his promise and appointed Associate Justice Neil gorsek to the US Supreme Court he's also appointed outstanding federal judges and down here in Florida in the Southern District of Florida we have five vacancies on a federal bench I've seen the ten names that have gone up to the president's desk I personally know two of them these are all exceptional jurists I know some others by reputation I personally know two the two that I know hardcore conservatives both of impeccable national security credentials now one of them was actually a good personal friend Amnon is the only woman whose name is being floated I think she's gonna get her judgeship and there are a few people I know who are more deserving this woman loves her nation he was a national security prosecutor he's just an outstanding human being outstanding American a great conservative she is going to be an asset through the judiciary in the federal bench now what were some things that were left out well I think there were more wins and then we got to look at what's going on with Immigration and Customs Enforcement being able to do their jobs the respect for law enforcement and the rule of law and with regards to the fake news Awards I would have liked to have seen three other categories special mention in broadcast television and that would have gone to Jim Acosta and brian Stelter over at CNN special mentioned for print that should have gone to Maggie Haberman and Glen thrush and special mention for periodicals just give it to Vanity Fair because they've all of a sudden jumped into the political fray with their own special blend of fake news but what's most glorious is watching the mainstream media implode and watching their allies in the Democratic National Committee lose their minds over Trump successes and their inability to control the narrative because the president and now us well we're all calling out the fake news
