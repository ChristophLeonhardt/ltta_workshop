the deep state is circling the wagons to protect special counsel Robert Muller I'll tell you all about it well something very disturbing is happening that lends credibility to the theory that there is an establishment move on both sides of the aisle by Republicans and by Democrats even by Republicans who have been very vocally supportive of the president like then to Sherry chairman Charles Grassley some of the chuck Grassley I don't like what's going on right now they're now moving to put a bill into committee starting in Grassley's Judiciary Committee to Protect robert muller now my my concern about this has nothing to do with my support for Donald Trump look I've been overwhelmingly supportive of the president on this show on air in other places but I'm also critical when need be I understand why the President signed the 1.3 trillion dollar spending bill but I wish he hadn't and I think he should have vetoed he should have sent a message he would have gotten his military funding Americans want their military funded but this is really troubling because this is now showing us that there's pressure by the establishment on the Republican side to not protect this president but to instead protect who I feel to be an unethical unrestricted improper actor Robert Muller I don't believe he's acting in good faith and many many legal experts are now coming over to our side of reasoning so to to push a bill into committee and a bipartisan bill into committee that protects special counsels well it has nothing to do with Donald Trump it strikes at the heart of our Constitution see the founding fathers never intended for there to be a shadow Department of Justice because that leads to a shadow government when you can have all of these unconfirmed people that are appointed by one player remember Robert Muller was appointed by one guy Rod Rosenstein who should be fired today but our system was never intended to have one person appointed by one other person who opera who operates outside of checks and balances it was never the way our system was intended to run it truly is a constitutional crisis and Congress has no business putting provisions in place to take away the authority of the presidency to fire people appointed by the executive branch it's exactly why checks and balances exists it's exactly why checks and balances exist it exists so that Congress Democrats in Congress and establishment Republicans who might not like an outsider president can't take away his power but fire people who work for him cuz Muller ultimately works for Donald Trump he was appointed by Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein which is a function who works for DOJ which is an agency of the executive branch and firing any of those people is a function of the executive branch or the president now this entire thing has made some very strange bedfellows right if you had said to me five years ago 42 years ago that liberal law professor of Harvard Law School Alan Dershowitz was gonna be one of Donald Trump's most staunchest defenders when he became a very conservative president I tell you to either stop drinking or give me some what you're drinking because it's good stuff but that's exactly what happened well really interesting story at a Newsmax now Bill O'Reilly's been doing some work over there and former Special Counsel President Bill Clinton not special counsel in the investigative sense but a very close adviser he was special counsel to Bill Clinton on the one on many of the scandals around the Clinton administration longtime friend of Bill Clinton Lanny Davis hold Bill O'Reilly that he is provided documents that Lanny Davis provided documents the Department of Justice may reduce you he has provided documents the Department of Justice investigators demonstrating the investigation into Hillary Clinton's emails was punched and predicted that the much-anticipated inspector general's report on the FBI handle it as handling of Hillary's email investigation will be quote intensely critical of former FBI director James Comey and former deputy director Andrew McCabe you heard that right let me explain it again Lanny Davis was like this with the Clintons he was also a very good person in front of george w bush from yale but like this with the Clintons provided information to the DOJ that says call me and McCabe botched the investigation into Hillary's emails that's just mind-blowing to me in many respects but in others it isn't interestingly enough guys like Manny Davis got slammed but I had some personal dealings with him back when I was very active in the online security world they told you before I was in media I had a company we tracked sexual predators pedophiles terror fundraisers recruiters online and I sat on a few boards and I sat on a few task forces and committees and on one of them sat Lanny Davis and he was this you know well very well known figure this was during the Bush administration the early days of the Bush administration into the early days of the Obama administration and Lanny Davis was this you know very well known and very well connected DC power broker who was one of the nicest people to me from day one and really an ethical and honest guy in the context in which I worked with him he heard both arguments he advocated for some very conservative positions that he thought made sense he advocated for some very liberal positions that he thought made sense but he was never a blind partisan he was never a blind partisan and he was always very approachable it was always very easy to talk to you know real smart lawyer always very easy to give advice one of the other guys on that panel was Richard Blumenthal senator dick Blumenthal from Connecticut who Ben was the Attorney General of Connecticut both Democrats both guys that I thought I wouldn't get along with Blumenthal was an absolutely horrible unfriendly miserable human being Lanny Davis was a gentleman really really nice man really I I found him to be a really honest and ethical guy so you know in the in the abstract looking at him as a clinton ally this would be shocking as some people having dealt with him on a professional level this doesn't surprise me this it really doesn't surprise me it surprises me though that after all these years he would drop the bomb on Clinton who knows what Hillary did to him over the years like she's done many many people there's so many more elements to this story I mean we're we're learning more and more things by the day some really new and disturbing information has come out on Peter stroke and Lisa page the to texting lovebirds and potential relationships between Andrew McCain his wife and Bill and Hillary Clinton there's potentially a friendship that goes back years and I'm gonna tell you all about that on my longer show off the cuff Declassified today right here on the rebel this McCabe Rosen's team Muller
