Moeller I want to tell you so bad I can't I'm not gonna but Bob Muller he hasn't spoken in public since this rush approach launched a year ago but SNL has deployed more than one actor to imagine what Muller might be like and whether he will ever answer this big question about collusion now witnesses say the real Muller is a stinks like presence who sits quietly along the wall as his investigators grill people and most of those people don't talk a lot about their experience if you have spoken out the most infamous being former Trump aids Sam Nunn Berg who claimed he defy Muller before cooperating as well as the wife of George papadopolis who's also told us about what went on this grand jury is taking this very very seriously to the extent that I was able to look at them mostly because I was facing the person whose question he may to the extent of zentral of them they were taking notes they were focus they were interested were the investigators professional or were they aggressive how is it for you the situation was clearly intimidating but they were very professional very fair I never felt like rested in any way professional and thorough another Trump aide who faced these investigators Michael Caputo saying something that could intimidate anyone who wants to hide from Muller explaining that Muller will know more than you do the malla team knew more about what I did in 2016 than I knew myself and I think they know more about the Trump campaign than anyone that ever worked there they're clearly focused on trying to identify some Russian collusion I'm joined by David priests the former CIA officer who used to give Bob Muller his morning intelligence briefing daily and also Wall Street Journal's Shelby Holliday who's been reporting on the Muller probe is back with us David speak to the point that Michael says which is both true but counterintuitive how could someone else know more about something than what live through but the whole point of intelligence whether you gather it the way you did at CIA or the way investigators do in a criminal probe is to gather the knowledge of way more than one person yeah it makes sense because our memories are infallible but facts remain and Bob Muller has access in this investigation to a range of things he has facts coming from other witnesses he has fact coming from foreign intelligence he has facts coming from bank records and transactions coming through the Treasury Department's Office called FinCEN the Financial Crimes enforcement network he's got no shortage of information his job is to process it his job is to put all that together and say what is the picture here and what pieces are we missing that we need to ask others about or what pieces do we think are here that we can see if people are telling the truth right and that goes - let me let me build on that and play something for you that goes to the sort of the old-school part of Muller has that almost a character or a fact-finder that I think has taken root in the public imagination we showed the SNL clips because in this moment right now there is I think a fascination with people who work only with facts I want to play his his maybe long-forgotten testimony about a very dramatic time when there was that Hospital confrontation in the Bush administration James Comey was involved Alberto Gonzalez was involved Ashcroft was involved and when asked about it he stuck to the most spare factual rendering he could under oath Bob Muller and didn't want to get into anything beyond the facts take a look were you surprised when you received the phone call from mr. Comey indicating if there was going to be this visit to mr. Ashcroft by gonzales and cart it was out of the ordinary tell me why you decided to make notes of your conversation with mr. Ashcroft it was out of the ordinary out of the ordinary how does that square with the man you worked with and that style that matches up very closely in fact he's not somebody who liked to show his cards he played things close to his vest but in my case I was the one there to answer his questions about foreign intelligence so that he could put this puzzle together and in doing so what I found was same mannerism you saw there played out on the other side which is when he's not receiving questions but asking them it was always with a purpose when he asked questions when he dug down into details that I didn't think he'd be interested in I later found out there was always a reason sometimes it didn't come until the end of the questioning and I found out ha he knows something from his work at the bureau or talking with other senior officials that I didn't know but now I see why he did this he was on a fishing expedition he thought he knew more than you do you think he was smarter than you I think he was much better at putting together information at the tactical and the strategic level at the same time than virtually anyone I worked with in my entire career at CIA in the State Department I never saw somebody who could simultaneously be following each detail and then at the same time jump to the big picture question and back again so rapidly it was it was fun to watch him work on that Shelby I can say that I've been speaking to some of the witnesses and possibly potential witnesses and everybody has this fear of Muller not just not just because he is the sphinx-like presence who maybe sits against the wall and listens but because for the exact same reasons we were just talking about he knows everything and he is very organized he is very efficient we hear that he just goes through questions his team goes through questions with a purpose no one is just kind of chatting or taking about this chilling no they they have a mission in there just hanging out there not hanging out what's gonna actively pursuing collusion as Michael Caputo said they look not just about obstruction take a look at something that began to get reported out on the beat as it happened because we had Sam Nunn Berg on some people remember that but long before stormy Daniels became a criminal case in New York we learned that Muller was asking some of these questions mm-hmm did Miller's folks ask anything that related to these issues around payments to people or women well look they asked if I had ever heard anything about that and my answer is I never have I've never heard you say that publicly before in your FBI interview with Miller tonight they were asking about payments to women they were asking if I knew anything about and though I mean we have to say we only know a few glimpses of what's happening in the Moller investigation because of witnesses like Sam who are willing to speak up a lot of witnesses aren't willing to tell us what they were asked we don't even know who all the witnesses are I think that's the biggest mystery of this investigation even members of Congress don't know what Muller has know as they have been simultaneously probing possible Russia collusion so it's just this giant mystery novel and you never know what page it ends on well and that's why it's fascinating to talk to some of these witnesses who are able legally to talk most of them choose not to on the advice of counsel the type who do come out may have their own reasons as journalists we can always speculate on why someone wants to do that but it's been very informative to hear at least as you say some of those glimpses hey I'm alright Melbourne from MSNBC you can see more of our videos right here or better yet subscribe to our YouTube channel below you could have been anywhere in the world that you're here with us and we appreciate that
