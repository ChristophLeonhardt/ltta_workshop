chemical weapons capabilities of Syrian dictator Bashar al-assad a combined operation with the Armed Forces of France and the United Kingdom is now underway we thank them both tonight I want to speak with you about why we have taken this action one year ago Assad launched a savage chemical weapons attack against his own innocent people the United States responded with 58 missile strikes that destroyed 20% of the syrian air force last Saturday the Assad regime again deployed chemical weapons to slaughter innocent civilians this time in the town of DOMA near the Syrian capital of Damascus this massacre was a significant escalation in a pattern of chemical weapons use by that very terrible regime the evil and the despicable attacked left mothers and fathers infants and children thrashing and pain and gasping for air these are not the actions of a man they are crimes of a monster instead following the horrors of World War one a century ago civilized nations joined together to ban chemical warfare chemical weapons are uniquely dangerous not only because they inflict gruesome suffering but because even small amounts can unleash widespread devastation the purpose of our actions tonight is to establish a strong deterrent against the production spread and use of chemical weapons establishing this deterrent is a vital national security interest of the United States the combined American British and French response to these atrocities will integrate all instruments of our national power military economic and diplomatic we are prepared to sustain this response until the Syrian regime stops its use of prohibited chemical agents I also have a message tonight for the two governments most responsible for supporting equipping and financing the criminal Assad regime to Iran and to Russia I asked what kind of a nation wants to be associated with the mass murder of innocent men women and children the nations of the world can be judged by the friends they keep no nation can succeed in the long run by promoting rogue States brutal tyrants and murderous dictators in 2013 President Putin and his government promised the world that they would guarantee the elimination of Syria's chemical weapons Assad's recent attack and today's response are the direct result of Russia's failure to keep that promise Russia must decide if it will continue down this dark path or if it will join with civilized nations as a force for stability and peace hopefully some day we'll get along with Russia and maybe even Iran but maybe not I will say this the United States has a lot to offer with the greatest and most powerful economy in the history of the world in Syria the United States with but a small force being used to eliminate what is left of Isis is doing what is necessary to protect the American people over the last year nearly 100 percent of the territory once controlled by the so-called Isis Caliphate in Syria and Iraq has been liberated and eliminated the United States has also rebuilt our friendships across the Middle East we have asked our partners to take greater responsibility for securing their home region including contributing large amounts of money for the resources equipment and all of the anti-isis effort increased engagement from our friends including Saudi Arabia the United Arab Emirates Qatar Egypt and others can ensure that Iran does not profit from the eradication of Isis America does not seek an indefinite presence in Syria under no circumstances as other nations step up their contributions we look forward to the day when we can bring our warriors home and great warriors they are looking around a very troubled world Americans have no illusions we cannot purge the world of evil or act everywhere there is tyranny no amount of American blood or treasure can produce lasting peace and security in the Middle East it's a troubled place we will try to make it better but it is a troubled place the United States will be a partner and a friend but the fate of the region lies in the hands of its own people in the last century we look straight into the darkest places of the human soul we saw the anguish that can be unleashed and the evil that can take hold by the end of World War one more than 1 million people had been killed or injured by chemical weapons we never want to see that ghastly specter return so today the nations of Britain France and the United States of America have marshal their righteous power against barbarism and brutality tonight I ask all Americans to say a prayer for our noble warriors and our allies as they carry out their missions we pray that God will bring comfort to those suffering in Syria we pray that God will guide the whole region toward a future of dignity and a peace and we pray that God will continue to watch over and bless the United States of America thank you and good night thank you
