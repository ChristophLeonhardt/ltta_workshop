I have several implants actually I have two products and three prototypes steam plants can be used to replace many things door locks keys for cars things like that but the implant process is pretty straightforward it's typically done with a needle so maybe a little bit bigger needle than than maybe a blood draw but that the pain is about the same in reality these personal use applications are more secure in many cases than what you would use to just buy food like a credit card or debit card any kind of electronic transaction is actually involving several other companies maybe five or ten other companies including your bank and you're letting them know where you were how much you spent at what time of day so the privacy invasion is actually much less with a personal use device like those ethical concerns I think in most cases bio hackers are self experimenting so there's a limitation on those concerns I believe for companies like what we're doing where we're actually commercializing some of the technology I think the idea that you know we would bring a dangerous technology to to the market is really not founded I mean we've done batteries of tests and we're actually looking to get FDA approval estates and seee mark and they use I do see this this idea of human augmentation through you know minimal procedures I think that's the future I mean we're tool using species and as our tools get smaller and more capable and more advanced they're just going to be inside of us that's just the way that it's going to go I think the most interesting thing that could happen with biohacking and would be a full cognitive upgrade meaning your biological brain and synapses are connected digitally to computer that has expansive capabilities you know one day you might say I have to think about a really hard problem I'm gonna I'm gonna pay Amazon to give me more brain power right and then you could think of it and then when you're done you would shut down that extra brain power and it would just be something you could expand at will
