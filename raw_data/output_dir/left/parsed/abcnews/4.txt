>> WE'VE COVERED A GREAT DEAL OF
TERRITORY.
I JUST LEFT, AS YOU KNOW, PRIME 
MINISTER ABE OF JAPAN, WE'RE 
STARTING TRADE TALKS WITH JAPAN.
THEY WERE NOT WILLING FOR YEARS 
TO TALK TRADE AND NOW THEY'RE 
WILLING TO TALK TRADE AND I'M 
SURE WE'LL MAKE A VERY GOOD 
DEAL.
JUST CONCLUDED, AS YOU KNOW, TWO
DAYS AGO, SIGNED A DEAL WITH 
SOUTH KOREA, TRADE DEAL, 
TREMENDOUS DEAL WITH SOUTH 
KOREA.
MEANS A LOT OF BUSINESS FOR OUR 
FARMERS.
WE'RE OPENING UP FOR FARMERS.
WE'RE OPENING UP FOR A LOT OF 
DIFFERENT GROUPS.
WE'RE GOING TO BE ABLE TO SELL 
MUCH MORE THAN DOUBLE THE NUMBER
OF AUTOMOBILES THAT WE WERE 
ALLOWED UNDER A DEAL THAT WAS 
TOTALLY DEFECTIVE THAT WAS THERE
BEFORE.
AND SO WE'RE VERY HAPPY WITH 
THAT.
THAT DEAL IS ACTUALLY CONCLUDED.
WE'RE VERY WELL ALONG THE WAY 
WITH MEXICO, THE RELATIONSHIP IS
VERY GOOD AND WITH CANADA, WE'LL
SEE WHAT HAPPENS.
THEY CHARGE US 300% TARIFFS ON 
DAIRY PRODUCTS, WE CAN'T HAVE 
THAT.
WE CAN'T HAVE THAT.
WITH CHINA, AS YOU KNOW, WE PUT 
OUT AN ANNOUNCEMENT TODAY, THEY 
WOULD LIKE TO SEE ME LOSE AN 
ELECTION BECAUSE THEY'VE NEVER 
BEEN CHALLENGED LIKE THIS, BUT I
WANT TO OPEN UP CHINA TO OUR 
FARMERS AND TO OUR 
INDUSTRIALISTS AND OUR COMPANIES
AND CHINA IS NOT OPEN, BUT WE'RE
OPEN TO THEM.
THEY CHARGE US 25%, 35%, 55% FOR
THINGS AND WE CHARGE THEM 
NOTHING IN TERMS OF COMING INTO 
THE COUNTRY.
CARS, THEY'RE 25% AND WE'RE AT 
2% AND 2.5% AND DON'T EVEN 
COLLECT IT, BUT WE COLLECT IT 
NOW.
SO, WE'RE DOING VERY WELL IN OUR
SITUATION WITH CHINA, ON TRADE.
I HAVE A GREAT RELATIONSHIP WITH
THE PRESIDENT OF CHINA, 
PRESIDENT XI.
BUT IT'S GOT TO BE A TWO-WAY 
STREET.
FOR 25 YEARS OR LONGER, IT WAS 
NOT.
AND TRILLIONS AND TRILLIONS OF 
DOLLARS WAS TAKEN OUT OF THE 
UNITED STATES FOR THE BENEFIT OF
CHINA.
WE JUST CAN'T HAVE THAT.
WE HAVE TO MAKE IT FAIR.
SO, WE'RE AT $250 BILLION NOW AT
25% INTEREST AND A LOT OF MONEY 
IS COME SPOOGING INTO OUR COFFE.
AND IT HAS ABSOLUTELY NO IMPACT 
ON OUR COMPANY, WHICH I SAID IT 
WOULDN'T.
IN FACT, STEEL IS LIKE THE 
HOTTEST INDUSTRY THERE IS.
IF YOU LOOK AT WHAT HAPPENED 
WITH STEEL, WE'RE CHARGING A 25%
TARIFF FOR THE DUMPERS.
THEY DUMP MASSIVE AMOUNTS OF 
STEEL, THEY WANT TO PUT THE 
STEEL COMPANIES OUT OF BUSINESS.
THEY'LL COME IN AND CHARGE FIVE 
TIMES MORE THAN YOU EVER THOUGHT
POSSIBLE.
WE NEED STEEL AND WE NEED 
ALUMINUM AND THOSE INDUSTRIES 
ARE DOING WELL, BUT STEEL IS 
INCREDIBLE.
U.S. STEEL IS OPENING UP A 
MINIMUM OF EIGHT PLANTS.
NEWCORE IS OPENING UP PLANTS, 
THESE ARE BIG PLANTS.
$750 MILLION, $1 BILLION PLANTS,
IN SOME CASES.
SO, WHAT'S HAPPENING WITH THE 
STEEL INDUSTRY IS VERY EXCITING 
TO ME.
IT'S BEING REBUILT OVERNIGHT.
IF YOU LOOK AT THE MINERS AND 
COAL, IF YOU LOOK AT ENERGY, 
LNG, JAPAN JUST GAVE US SOME 
NUMBERS THAT ARE INCREDIBLE.
THEY'RE DOUBLING THE AMOUNT THAT
THEY'RE GOING TO BE BUYING FOR 
JAPAN.
THEY'RE TAKING THE LNG AND 
THEY'RE DOUBLING IT UP.
I SAID, YOU HAVE TO DO ME A 
FAVOR, WE DON'T WANT THESE BIG 
DEFICITS.
YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO BUY 
MORE.
THEY'RE BUYING MASSIVE AMOUNTS 
OF EQUIPMENT AND MILITARY 
EQUIPMENT AND OTHER COUNTRIES 
ARE DOING THE SAME THING.
BECAUSE WE HAVE TRADE IMBALANCES
WITH ALMOST EVERYBODY.
IT'S A RARE EXCEPTION THAT WE 
DON'T.
SO, WE ARE DOING GREAT AS A 
COUNTRY.
UNFORTUNATELY, THEY JUST RAISED 
INTEREST RATES A LITTLE BIT.
I'M NOT HAPPY ABOUT THAT, 
BECAUSE I KNOW IT'S GOING TO BE 
A QUESTION.
I AM NOT HAPPY ABOUT THAT.
I'D RATHER PAY DOWN DEBT OR DO 
OTHER THINGS, CREATE MORE  JOBS 
SO, I'M WORRIED ABOUT THE FACT 
THAT THEY SEEM TO LIKE RAISING 
INTEREST RATES.
WE CAN DO OTHER THINGS WITH THE 
MONEY.
AND -- BUT THEY RAISED THEM, AND
THEY'RE RAISING THEM BECAUSE 
WE'RE DOING SO WELL.
WE'RE DOING MUCH BETTER THAN I 
HAD PROJECTED IN TERMS OF WHEN I
WAS CAMPAIGNING, I SAID WE WERE 
GOING TO DO THIS AND WE'RE DOING
MUCH BETTER THAN -- THAN ANYBODY
EVER THOUGHT POSSIBLE.
AND I WILL SAY, IF OTHERS GOT
IN, IT WOULD HAVE BEEN JUST THE 
OPPOSITE, BECAUSE THEY WERE 
GOING TO PUT RESTRICTIONS ON, 
THEY WERE GOING TO PUT 
REGULATIONS ON, THEY WERE GOING 
TO CHOKE THE ECONOMY AS IT WAS 
ALREADY CHOKING, BUT IT WOULD 
HAVE BEEN WORSE AND THEY WERE 
GOING TO RAISE YOUR TAXES, 
THAT'S WHAT THEY WANT TO DO NOW,
IF THEY EVER GOT CONTROL.
WHICH I DON'T THINK THEY'LL HAVE
CONTROL FOR A LONG TIME.
SO, WITH THAT BEING SAID, WE'LL 
TAKE SOME QUESTIONS AND, YES, 
PLEASE, JOHN, GO AHEAD.
WE HAVE PLENTY OF TIME.
>> MR. PRESIDENT, THANK YOU VERY
MUCH.
OF COURSE, WHAT YOU'RE LOOKING 
FORWARD TO TOMORROW IS THE 
HEARINGS WITH JUDGE KAVANAUGH 
BEFORE THE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE.
>> YES, YES.
>> IN 1991, WHEN JOE BIDEN 
PASSED A LAW INTO THE BUSH 41 
WHITE HOUSE, THE ALLEGATIONS 
THAT AKNEE THAT HILL RAISED 
AGAINST CLARENCE THOMAS, THE 
BUSH WHITE HOUSE ASKED THE FBI 
TO LOOK INTO IT AS PART OF JUDGE
THOMAS' BACKGROUND 
INVESTIGATION.
NOT A CRIMINAL INVESTIGATION, 
BUT THE BACKGROUND 
INVESTIGATION.
WHEN THESE ALLEGATIONS WERE 
RAISED, WHY DIDN'T THIS WHITE 
HOUSE DO THE SAME THING, AND 
WITH ALL OF THE ALLEGATIONS THAT
ARE COMING OUT NOW ABOUT JUDGE 
KAVANAUGH, WAS THERE AN 
OPPORTUNITY MISSED HERE TO HAVE 
INVESTIGATIORS LOOK INTO THIS AD
GET SOME SORT OF CLARITY ONE WAY
OR THE OTHER?
>> WELL, THE FBI TOLD US, 
THEY'VE INVESTIGATED JUDGE 
KAVANAUGH SIX TIMES, FIVE TIMES,
MANY TIMES OVER THE YEARS.
THEY KNOW HIM VERY WELL.
BUT HERE THERE WAS NOTHING TO 
INVESTIGATE, FROM AT LEAST ONE 
STANDPOINT, THEY DIDN'T KNOW THE
LOCATION, THEY DIDN'T KNOW THE 
TIME, THEY DIDN'T KNOW THE YEAR.
THEY DIDN'T KNOW ANYTHING.
AND IT'S LIKE, WHERE DO YOU GO?
ALSO, IT'S NOT FOR THE FBI, IF 
YOU LOOK AT WHAT JOE BIDEN SAID,
HE SAID THEY DON'T DO THIS, AND 
HE SAID IT VERY CLEARLY, SO -- I
THINK WHEN YOU REALLY LOOK AT IT
ALL, IT'S NOT GOING TO CHANGE 
ANY OF THE DEMOCRATS' MINDS.
THEY'RE OBSTRUCTIONISTS.
THEY'RE ACTUALLY CON ARTISTS, 
BECAUSE THEY KNOW HOW QUALITY 
THIS MAN IS, AND THEY'VE 
DESTROYED A MAN'S REPUTATION AND
THEY WANT TO DESTROY IT EVEN 
MORE.
AND I THINK PEOPLE ARE GOING TO 
SEE THAT IN THE MIDTERMS.
WHAT THEY'VE DONE TO THIS 
FAMILY, WHAT THEY'VE DONE TO 
THESE CHILDREN, THESE BEAUTIFUL 
CHILDREN OF HIS AND WHAT THEY'VE
DONE TO HIS WIFE, AND THEY KNOW 
IT'S A BIG, FAT CON JOB.
AND THEY GO INTO A ROOM AND I 
GUARANTEE YOU THEY LAUGH LIKE 
HELL AS WHAT THEY PULLED OFF ON 
YOU AND ON THE PUBLIC.
THEY LAUGH LIKE HELL.
SO, IT WOULDN'T HAVE MATTERED IF
THE FBI CAME BACK WITH THE 
CLEANEST SCORE AND YOU 
UNDERSTAND THAT VERY WELL, JOHN.
IF THEY WOULD HAVE COME BACK 
WITH THE MOST PERFECT, WE FOUND 
EVERYTHING AND HE'S PERFECTLY 
INNOCENT OF EVERYTHING, IT 
WOULDN'T HAVE MADE A DIFFERENCE.
YOU WOULDN'T HAVE GOTTEN ONE 
VOTE.
NOW, WE WILL GET VOTES FROM THE 
DEMOCRATS IF WE WIN.
YOU'LL HAVE THREE, FOUR OR FIVE 
DEMOCRATS GIVING US VOTES, 
BECAUSE THEY'RE IN STATES THAT I
WON BY 30 AND 40 POINTS AND 
THEY'RE GOING TO GIVE US VOTES.
BUT OTHER THAN THAT, YOU 
PROBABLY WON'T GET ANY, JOHN.
YES, GO AHEAD.
PLEASE.
>> MR. PRESIDENT, THERE ARE NOW 
THREE WOMEN ACCUSING JUDGE 
KAVANAUGH OF SEXUAL MISCONDUCT.
ARE YOU SAYING THAT ALL THREE OF
THOSE WOMEN ARE LIARS?
IS THERE ANYTHING THAT CAN BE 
SAID TOMORROW THAT COULD CAUSE 
YOU TO WITHDRAW THE NOMINATION?
ANYTHING AT ALL -- 
>> I WON'T GET INTO THAT GAME.
I ONLY TELL YOU THIS.
THIS IS ONE OF THE HIGHEST 
QUALITY PEOPLE THAT I'VE EVER 
MET.
AND EVERYBODY THAT KNOWS HIM 
SAYS THE SAME THING.
AND THESE ARE ALL FALSE, TO ME, 
THESE ARE FALSE ACCUSATIONS IN 
CERTAIN CASES AND CERTAIN CASES,
EVEN THE MEDIA AGREES WITH THAT.
I CAN ONLY SAY THAT WHAT THEY'VE
DONE TO THIS MAN IS INCREDIBLE.
YOU KNOW, IT'S VERY INTERESTING,
I PICK A LOT OF JUDGES, I HAVE 
145 JUDGES I WILL BE PICKING BY 
THE END OF A FAIRLY SHORT PERIOD
OF TIME, BECAUSE PRESIDENT OBAMA
WASN'T BIG ON PICKING JUDGES.
WHEN INGOT THERE, I SAID, WHO IS
THIS POSSIBLE?
I HAVE 145, INCLUDING COURT OF 
APPEALS JUDGES.
AND THEY JUST DIDN'T DO IT, YOU 
KNOW WHY?
THEY GOT TIRED, THEY GOT 
COMPLACENT.
SOMETHING HAPPENED.
I HAVE 145 JUDGES.
EVERYBODY WANTS TO BE A FEDERAL 
JUDGE.
NOT JUST A SUPREME COURT JUDGE, 
I'M TALKING ABOUT COURT OF 
APPEALS, I'M TALKING ABOUT 
DISTRICT COURT.
I DON'T THINK THEY'RE GOING TO 
WANT TO SO MUCH, I'LL BE CALLING
PEOPLE AND WE'LL HAVE PEOPLE 
CALLING PEOPLE THAT DO THIS AND 
PEOPLE ARE GOING TO BE SCARED, 
BECAUSE WE COULD SAY IT ABOUT 
YOU, 35 YEARS AGO, YOU MET -- 
AND YOU MIGHT KNOW -- YOU MIGHT 
NOT KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON.
WHAT IS GOING ON?
WHY DID THEY WAIT SO LONG?
WHY DID SENATOR FEINSTEIN WAIT 
UNTIL THE HEARINGS WERE OVER AND
MAKE THIS CASE?
WHY DIDN'T SHE BRING IT RIGHT AT
THE BEGINNING, WHEN YOU ASKED 
ABOUT, AS AN EXAMPLE, THE FBI, 
WHY DIDN'T THEY BRING THIS RIGHT
AT THE BEGINNING?
DURING THE HEARING?
YOU WOULD HAVE HAD ALL THE TIME 
IN THE WORLD FOR THE FBI, IT 
WOULD HAVE BEEN FINE.
NOW, THE FBI, AS YOU KNOW, DID 
INVESTIGATE THIS TIME, AS THEY 
HAVE FIVE OR SIX OTHER TIMES, 
AND THEY DID A VERY THOROUGH 
INVESTIGATION, BUT THIS IS A BIG
CON JOB.
AND I WOULD LOVE TO BE IN THE 
ROOM WITH THE DEMOCRATS, CLOSE 
THE DOOR, YOU GUYS ARE ALL AWAY 
OUTSIDE WAITING AND SCHUMER AND 
HIS BUDDIES ARE ALL IN THERE 
LAUGHING, HOW WE FOOLED YOU ALL.
LET'S JUST STOP THEM, A BIG, FAT
CON.
>> MR. PRESIDENT, IF I CAN 
FOLLOW UP.
IF YOU HAVE DAUGHTERS.
YOU CAN UNDERSTAND WHY A VICTIM 
OF SEXUAL ASSAULT WOULD NOT 
REPORT IT AT THE TIME?
DON'T YOU UNDERSTAND -- 
>> BY THE WAY, I ONLY SAY THIS.
36 YEARS, NO CHARGE, NO 
NOTHING -- 
>> BUT THAT HAPPENS OFTEN.
>> PEOPLE ARE GOING TO HAVE TO 
MAKE A DECISION.
36 YEARS, THERE'S NO CHARGE.
ALL OF A SUDDEN, THE HEARINGS 
ARE OVER AND THE RUMORS START 
COMING OUT AND THEN YOU HAVE 
THIS OTHER CON ARTIST, AVENATTI,
COME OUT WITH ANOTHER BEAUTY 
TODAY.
ONLY I SAY THAT YOU HAVE TO LOOK
AT THE FACTS, THE SENATORS ARE 
VERY CAPABLE PEOPLE, THEY'RE 
VERY GOOD PEOPLE, I KNOW MANY OF
THEM, THEY'RE FRIENDS OF MINE.
THESE ARE VERY TALENTED, VERY 
GOOD PEOPLE, AND THEY'RE GOING 
TO VOTE.
THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE TO BELIEVE
WHAT THEY BELIEVE.
I CAN -- WHEN I LOOK AT WHAT'S 
HAPPENED TO THE REPUTATION OF A 
GREAT GENTLEMAN, A GREAT 
INTELLECT, A BRILLIANT MAN, 
SOMEBODY WHO HAS A CHANCE TO BE 
ONE OF OUR GREAT SUPREME COURT 
JUSTICES IN HISTORY INTELLECT 
CHULLY, I THINK IT'S A CHANGE.
YES, PLEASE.
>> MR. PRESIDENT, YESTERDAY AT 
THE SPEECH, AT THE U.N., YOU 
SPOKE ABOUT HOW VENEZUELA'S 
PROBLEM WAS BECAUSE OF CUBA AND 
THE CASTROS, HOW THEY WENT IN 
THERE AND THEY BROUGHT SOCIALISM
AND COMMUNISM TO VENEZUELA AND 
NOW TO NICARAGUA, AS WELL.
MR. PRESIDENT, ARE YOU GOING TO 
BE MORE PROACTIVE NOW AGAINST 
CUBA, AS WELL?
>> I'VE BEEN VERY PROACTIVE 
AGAINST CUBA.
I DON'T LIKE WHAT'S HAPPENING IN
CUBA.
AS YOU KNOW, PRESIDENT OBAMA 
GAVE THEM A PASS, AND I DIDN'T 
LIKE IT.
NEITHER DO CUBAN PEOPLE, BASED 
IN MIAMI AND BASED IN OUR 
COUNTRY THAT CAME FROM CUBA AND 
SUFFERED IN CUBA.
I DON'T LIKE WHAT HE DID.
I'VE ENDED MUCH OF IT, MOST OF 
IT.
I DON'T LIKE WHAT'S HAPPENING IN
CUBA AND I CERTAINLY DON'T LIKE 
WHAT'S HAPPENING IN VENEZUELA.
YES, PLEASE.
GO AHEAD.
>> MR. PRESIDENT, JUST TO FINISH
REALLY FAST, YOU SAID ALSO THAT 
YOU HAD A CALL TO ACTION TO ASK 
THE LEADERS AROUND THE WORLD TO 
ALSO END SOCIALISM.
WOULD YOU LIKE TO BE 
RECOGNIZED -- 
>> WELL, I WOULDN'T SAY THAT 
SOCIALISM HAS BEEN WORKING 
REALLY WELL AROUND THE WORLD.
YOU CAN LOOK AT VENEZUELA, YOUR 
NUMBER ONE, I GUESS THE ONE 
THAT'S MOST OBVIOUS, BUT YOU 
TAKE A LOOK AROUND THE WORLD, 
SOCIALISM IS NOT EXACTLY RIDING 
HIGH.
PLEASE.
GO AHEAD.
>> THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
IF YOU DON'T MIND, AFTER I'M 
FINISHED, IF ONE OF OUR FEMALE 
COLLEAGUES COULD GO AFTER ME, 
THAT WOULD BE GREAT.
MR. PRESIDENT, JUST TO FOLLOW UP
ON THESE ALLEGATIONS AGAINST -- 
>> WHAT DOES HE MEAN BY THAT?
EXPLAIN?
WHAT IS -- 
>> I THINK IT WOULD BE GREAT IF 
A FEMALE REPORTER -- 
>> WHAT DOES IT MEAN?
>> IT WOULD BE GREAT IF A FEMALE
REPORTER WOULD ASK YOU A 
QUESTION ABOUT THIS ISSUE.
>> I WOULDN'T MIND IT AT ALL.
>> LET ME -- 
>> WOULDN'T MAKE ANY DIFFERENCE 
TO ME.
GO AHEAD.
>> IF I COULD FOLLOW UP ON JON 
AND JOHN'S QUESTION, WHY IS IT, 
MR. PRESIDENT, THAT YOU ALWAYS 
SEEM TO SIDE WITH THE ACCUSED 
AND NOT THE ACCUSER?
YOU HAVE THREE WOMEN HERE WHO 
ARE ALL MAKING ALLEGATIONS, WHO 
ARE ALL ASKING THAT THEIR 
STORIES BE HEARD, AND, YOU KNOW,
IF YOU LOOK AT THE CASE OF ROY 
MOORE, IF YOU LOOK AT THE CASE 
OF ONE OF YOUR STAFFERS, YOU 
SEEM TO, TIME AND AGAIN, SIDE 
WITH THE ACCUSED AND NOT THE 
ACCUSER.
IS THAT BECAUSE OF THE MANY 
ALLEGATIONS THAT YOU'VE HAD MADE
AGAINST YOU OVER THE YEARS IN. 
>> WELL, FIRST OF ALL, I WASN'T 
HAPPY WITH ROY MOORE, LET'S GET 
THAT STRAIGHT, BUT ROY MOORE WAS
A -- 
>> YOU STOOD BY HIM.
>> A REPUBLICAN CANDIDATE, AND I
WOULD HAVE RATHER HAD A 
REPUBLICAN CANDIDATE WIN.
I WAS VERY HAPPY WITH LUTHER 
STRANGE, WHO WAS A TERRIFIC MAN 
FROM ALABAMA, BUT LUTHER STRANGE
HAD A LOT OF THINGS GOING 
AGAINST HIM.
AS FAR AS WOMEN, WHETHER IT'S A 
MAN OR A WOMAN, THESE ARE, YOU 
KNOW, IT CAN HAPPEN THE OTHER 
WAY, ALLEGATIONS CAN GO THE 
OTHER WAY, ALSO.
YOU UNDERSTAND THAT.
AND WHETHER IT WAS A MAN OR A 
WOMAN, 30 YEARS AGO, 36 YEARS 
AGO, IN FACT, THEY DON'T EVEN 
KNOW HOW MANY YEARS AGO BECAUSE 
NOBODY NO
KNOWS WHAT THE TIME IS.
AND I COULD PICK AS AN EXAMPLE, 
HOPEFULLY I WON'T HAVE TO DO IT 
AS A REPLACEMENT, BECAUSE 
HOPEFULLY THIS IS GOING TO GO 
VERY WELL ON THURSDAY, IT'S 
GOING TO GO VERY WELL ON MONDAY 
OR SATURDAY OR SUNDAY OR 
WHENEVER THEY VOTE, BUT I COULD 
PICK A WOMAN AND SHE COULD HAVE 
CHARGES MADE FROM MANY YEARS AGO
ALSO.
>> BUT DON'T YOU UNDERSTAND, 
SIR -- 
>> I WOULD LOOK AT THE 
CHARACTER -- WHAT I HAVE TO 
DO -- 
>> YOU'VE RAISED DOUBTS ABOUT 
THESE ACCUSERS. 
>>> DON'T THINK PEOPLE ARE 
RELUCTANT TO COME FORWARD.
THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE A CHANCE 
TO SPEAK -- EXCUSE ME.
THEY HAVE A MAJOR CHANCE TO 
SPEAK.
AND IT WILL BE TOMORROW, I 
ASSUME.
WE'VE DELAYED THIS, MEANING THE 
REPUBLICAN SENATORS, NOT ME, THE
REPUBLICAN SENATORS HAVE DELAYED
THIS FOR WEEKS NOW.
THEY'RE GIVING THE WOMEN A MAJOR
CHANCE TO SPEAK.
NOW IT'S POSSIBLE I'LL HEAR THAT
AND I'LL SAY, HEY, I'M CHANGING 
MY MIND.
THAT IS POSSIBLE.
WE WANT TO GIVE THEM A CHANCE TO
SPEAK.
>> ALL THREE SHOULD HAVE THE 
CHANCE?
>> WELL, WHOEVER IS GIVEN A 
CHANCE, WE'VE DELAYED IT A LONG 
TIME.
BUT THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE A BIG 
SHOT AT MAKING THEIR CASE, AND, 
YOU KNOW WHAT, I CAN BE 
PERSUADED, ALSO, OKAY?
YES, PLEASE, GO AHEAD.
GO AHEAD.
I'D LIKE TO GO -- YES, GO AHEAD,
PLEASE.
>> THANK YOU, MR. PRESIDENT.
A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS FOR YOU TO
FOLLOW UP ON SOME ANSWERS THAT I
DIDN'T HEAR IF YOU, IF YOU WOULD
ALLOW ME A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS.
FIRST OF ALL, DO YOU THINK THESE
WOMEN, ALL THREE OF THEM, ARE 
LIARS?
Y YES OR NO?
>> I CAN'T TELL YOU.
I JUST HEARD ABOUT ONE A LITTLE 
WHILE AGO.
I CAN TELL YOU HER LAWYER IS A 
LOW LIFE, OKAY?
SO, I CAN'T TELL YOU WHETHER OR 
NOT THEY'RE LIARS UNTIL I HEAR 
THEM.
I DON'T KNOW WHAT HAPPENED 
TODAY, BECAUSE I'VE BEEN VERY 
BUSY WITH JAPAN, WITH SOUTH 
KOREA WITH CHINA AND ABOUT SEVEN
OTHER COUNTRIES, AND I CHAIRED 
THE SECURITY COUNCIL.
SO, I DON'T KNOW ABOUT TODAY'S 
PERSON THAT CAME FORWARD.
I DO KNOW ABOUT THE LAWYER AND 
YOU DON'T GET MUCH WORSE, BAD 
REPUTATION, TO TAKE A LOOK AT 
HIS PAST, SO, AS FAR AS THE 
OTHER WOMEN ARE CONCERNED, I'M 
GOING TO SEE WHAT HAPPENS 
TOMORROW.
I'M GOING TO BE WATCHING, YOU 
KNOW, BELIEVE IT OR NOT.
I'M GOING TO SEE WHAT'S SAID.
IT'S POSSIBLE THAT THEY WILL BE 
CONVINCING.
NOW, WITH ALL OF THAT BEING 
SAID, JUDGE BRETT KAVANAUGH HAS 
BEEN, FOR MANY YEARS, ONE OF THE
MOST RESPECTED PEOPLE IN 
WASHINGTON.
HE'S BEEN ON, I GUESS YOU'D CALL
IT THE SECOND-HIGHEST COURT.
AND EVERY SINGLE PERSON WHO 
KNOWS HIM, A LOT OF PEOPLE KNOW 
HIM WELL.
AND THOSE PEOPLE DON'T BELIEVE 
WHAT'S GOING ON.
I CAN ALWAYS BE CONVINCED.
I HAVE TO HEAR IT.
>> IT SOUNDS LIKE WHAT YOU'RE 
SAYING IS, THERE IS A SITUATION,
THERE IS A SCENARIO UNDERWHICH 
YOU WOULD WITHDRAW THE 
NOMINATION.
IS THAT CORRECT?
>> IF I THOUGHT HE WAS GUILTY OF
SOMETHING LIKE THIS, YEAH, SURE.
>> YOU WILL WAIT UNTIL TOMORROW 
TO MAKE YOUR MIND?
>> I WANT TO WATCH.
I HOPE I CAN WATCH.
I'M MEETING WITH LOOT T OF 
COUNTRIES TOMORROW.
BUT I WILL BE ABLE TO WATCH.
AND I'LL RELY ON SOME VERY FAIR 
AND TALENTED REPUBLICAN SENATORS
WHO -- LOOK, IF WE BROUGHT 
GEORGE WASHINGTON HERE AND WE 
SAID, WE HAVE GEORGE WASHINGTON,
THE DEMOCRATS WOULD VOTE AGAINST
HIM, JUST SO YOU UNDERSTAND.
AND HE MAY HAVE HAD A BAD PAST, 
WHO KNOWS, YOU KNOW.
HE MAY HAVE HAD SOME, I THINK, 
ACCUSATIONS MADE.
DIDN'T HE HAVE A COUPLE OF 
THINGS IN HIS PAST?
GEORGE WASHINGTON WOULD BE VOTED
AGAINST 100% BY SCHUMER AND THE 
CON ARTISTS.
100%, 100%.
SO, IT REALLY DOESN'T MATTER 
FROM THEIR STANDPOINT.
THAT'S WHY WHEN JOHN ASKED ABOUT
THE FBI, IF THE FBI DID THE MOST
THOROUGH INVESTIGATION IN THE 
HISTORY OF THE FBI AND THEY 
FOUND HIM TO BE 100% PERFECT, HE
WOULD LOSE EVERY SINGLE VOTE.
NOW, IF THE REPUBLICANS WIN 
TOMORROW, I THINK YOU'RE GOING 
TO GET SOME VOTES.
FROM THE DEMOCRATS, YOU KNOW 
WHY?
BECAUSE WE KNOW WHY.
IT'S POLITICS.
OKAY, LET'S GO.
ONE MORE QUESTION.
I'D LIKE TO ASK ABOUT THREE 
QUESTIONS, IT'S NOT FAIR TO 
EVERYONE ELSE.
SHOULD I LET HER ASK ANOTHER 
QUESTION?
GO AHEAD.
>> TO FOLLOW UP ON A QUESTION 
THAT A COLLEAGUE ASKED, AS WELL,
ABOUT THE BENEFIT OF THE DOUBT 
THAT YOU HAVE GIVEN TO PEOPLE 
LIKE ROY MOORE, TO ROGER AILES, 
TO BRETT KAVANAUGH, THEY'RE ALL 
MEN.
WHY IS THAT -- 
>> IT'S NOT A BENEFIT OF THE 
DOUBT.
I'VE KNOWN THEM -- I'VE KNOWN 
THEM FOR A LONG TIME.
AND A -- A LOT OF THESE PEOPLE.
A LOT OF PEOPLE.
AND SOME I'VE BEEN DISPOINTED 
WITH, I HAVE BEEN DISAPPOINTED 
WITH SOME,OTHERS, YOU KNOW, 
THERE ARE CHARGES THAT ARE 
PRETTY WEAK.
I'VE KNOWN PEOPLE FOR A LONG 
TIME.
I NEVER SAW THEM DO ANYTHING 
WRONG.
I NEVER SAW THEM DO ANYTHING 
WRONG.
AND THERE ARE SOME THAT 
PROBABLY, I CAN TELL YOU, THERE 
ARE SOME THAT I'VE BEEN WATCHING
FOR A LONG TIME AND IN A COUPLE 
OF CASES THEY WEREN'T 
REPUBLICANS, IN A LOT OF CASES, 
THEY WERE NOT, THEY WERE EXACTLY
THE OPPOSITE, BUT I'VE BEEN 
WATCHING THEM FOR A LONG TIME, 
AND I KNEW FOR A LONG TIME THESE
WERE NOT GOOD PEOPLE, AND THEY 
WERER IN BROUGHT UP.
OKAY.
YES, MA'AM, GO AHEAD.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH, BY THE WAY.
THANK YOU.
>> THANK YOU, MR. PRESIDENT.
WHEN THE ALLEGATIONS FIRST 
SURFACED, YOU INITIALLY SAID HOW
IMPORTANT IT WAS FOR DR. FORD TO
TESTIFY AND THAT YOU WANTED TO 
HEAR FROM HER.
>> I DO.
I WISH IT COULD HAVE GONE 
QUICKER.
>> WELL, YOU ALSO SAID THAT IF 
WHAT SHE SAID WERE AS BAD AS SHE
CLAIMS, SURELY HER OR HER 
PARENTS WOULD HAVE REPORTED IT.
AND JUST TODAY YOU SAID YOU -- 
>> WELL, THERE IS THE TRUTH.
THERE IS THE CHANCE THAT HER 
PARENTS COULD HAVE REPORTED IT 
26 YEARS AGO.
>> SO MY QUESTION IS -- 
>> IT DOESN'T MEAN THEY HAVE TO 
REPORT IT, BECAUSE IN SOME 
INSTANCES, PEOPLE KEEP IT QUIET,
IT'S A VERY TOUGH SITUATION FOR 
A WOMAN, THERE'S NO QUESTION 
ABOUT IT.
AND IN SOME CASES, THEY DO 
REPORT IT.
FRANKLY, HAD THEIR REPORTED IT, 
IT WOULD HAVE BEEN PRETTY 
AMAZING, WOULDN'T IT?
BUT I GUESS THEY DIDN'T, AND 
THAT'S OKAY.
I'M NOT SAYING THEY HAD TO 
REPORT IT.
BECAUSE IT'S A VERY PERSONAL 
THING, IT'S A VERY BIG PROBLEM.
THERE'S NO QUESTION ABOUT IT.
>> DO YOU WANT TO HEAR HER STORY
BECAUSE -- YOU ALREADY MADE UP 
YOUR MIND.
>> THEY WOULD HAVE GIVEN HER 
TIME LAST WEEK.
THIS IS THE UNITED STATES 
SENATE.
THIS IS THE MOST IMPORTANT 
POSITION THAT A PRESIDENT CAN 
GIVE OUT, I THINK WE CAN SAY, BY
FAR.
I'VE ACTUALLY HEARD IT'S THE 
MOST IMPORTANT DECISION A 
PRESIDENT CAN MAKE.
I DISAGREE WITH THAT.
WAR AND PEACE, I ALWAYS SAY, WAR
AND PEACE, AND AFTER THAT, 
SUPREME COURT JUSTICE, RIGHT?
I LOOK FORWARD TO HEARING FROM 
HER.
WE COULD HAVE HEAR FROM HER LAST
WEEK.
WE COULD HAVE HEARD FROM HER FOR
A LONG TIME.
IT WILL BE INTERESTING TO HEAR 
WHAT SHE HAS TO SAY, OKAY?
>> LET ME FOLLOW UP ON JIM'S 
QUESTION THAT I DON'T THINK WE 
GOT AN ANSWER TO.
>> WHICH ONE, WHICH QUESTION?
WHO?
>> HOW HAVE YOUR PERSONAL 
EXPERIENCES BEING ACCUSED -- 
>> I'VE BEEN ACCUSED.
FALSE ACCUSATIONS.
>> RIGHT.
>> I'VE BEEN ACCUSED.
AND I WAS ACCUSED BY, I BELIEVE 
IT WAS FOUR WOMEN, YOU CAN CHECK
WITH SEAN HANNITY, YOU CAN CHECK
WITH FOX, BECAUSE THEY COVERED 
IT VERY STRONGLY -- 
>> AND HOW HAVE THOSE -- 
>> EXCUSE ME.
I WAS ACCUSED BY FOUR OR FIVE 
WOMEN THAT GOT PAID A LOT OF 
MONEY TO MAKE UP STORIES ABOUT 
ME.
WE CAUGHT THEM AND THE 
MAINSTREAM MEDIA REFUSED TO PUT 
IT ON TELEVISION.
THEY REFUSED TO WRITE ABOUT IT.
THERE WERE FOUR WOMEN AND MAYBE 
MORE, I THINK THE NUMBER IS FOUR
OR FIVE, BUT ONE HAD A MORTGAGE 
PAID OFF HER HOUSE, $52,000.
ANOTHER ONE HAD OTHER THINGS 
HAPPEN.
AND THE ONE THAT REPORTED IT, I 
BELIEVE, WAS OFFERED $750,000 TO
SAY BAD THINGS ABOUT ME AND SHE 
IS THE ONE THAT REPORTED IT.
THIS WOMAN IS INCREDIBLE.
SHE REPORTED IT INSTEAD OF 
TAKING THE MONEY.
SO, I'VE HAD NUMEROUS 
ACCUSATIONS ABOUT ME.
>> RIGHT.
>> THEY MADE FALSE STATEMENTS 
ABOUT ME, KNOWING THEY WERE 
FALSE.
I NEVER MET THEM.
I NEVER MET THESE PEOPLE.
AND WHAT DID THEY DO, WHAT DID 
THEY GO?
THEY TOOK MONEY IN ORDER TO SAY 
BAD THINGS.
I'VE HAD STORIES WRITTEN IN "THE
NEW YORK TIMES," FRONT PAGE, 
ABOUT FOUR WOMEN, THE WHOLE TOP 
CENTER FRONT PAGE OF "THE NEW 
YORK TIMES".
I THINK IT WAS FOUR BIG 
PICTURES, I SAID, WOW, THAT'S A 
BIG THING, WHAT'S THAT?
THESE WERE WOMEN THAT WERE 
QUOTED SAYING BAD THINGS ABOUT 
ME.
NOT THE WORST THINGS ABOUT ME, 
BUT BAD THINGS.
AND I SAID, GEE, THAT'S TOO BAD.
I KNEW THEM A LONG TIME AGO, 15,
20 YEARS AGO.
THAT'S TOO BAD.
I'M SURPRISED AT THAT.
AND THEN I SEE THEM ON 
TELEVISION, NOTHING TO DO WITH 
ME, THE NEXT DAY, OR DAY LATER, 
THEY WERE INCENSED, THEY SAID, 
DONALD TRUMP IS A NICE GUY, WE 
NEVER SAID THIS.
"THE NEW YORK TIMES" DID FALSE 
REPORTING.
THEY'RE FAKE NEWS.
AND, YOU KNOW WHAT?
"THE NEW YORK TIMES" WOULD NOT 
REPORT THAT THEIR STORY WAS 
FAKE.
THESE WOMEN SAID GREAT THINGS, 
NOT ONLY DID THEY NOT SAY THE 
BAD STUFF, THEY SAID GREAT 
THINGS ABOUT ME.
FRONT PAGE.
AND THOSE WOMEN, THEY'RE 
INCREDIBLE WOMEN, THEY WENT ON 
TELEVISION AND THEY DIDN'T WANT 
TO, AND I DIDN'T ASK THEM, AND 
THEY SAID "THE NEW YORK TIMES" 
MADE IT UP.
THEY GAVE FALSE QUOTES.
AND THEY WENT ON A LOT OF SHOWS,
THEY WERE REALLY INCENSED AND 
THEY COULDN'T BELIEVE IT.
THAT'S WHY -- PEOPLE KNOW THAT A
LOT OF THE NEWS IS FAKE, AND A 
LOT OF THE PEOPLE SITTING HERE 
ARE FAKE.
BUT 20% OF THEM ARE WONDERFUL, 
OKAY?
>> IF I COULD ACTUALLY ASK ME 
QUESTION, MR. TRUMP.
YOU DIDN'T LET ME ASK MY 
QUESTION.
>> YOU'VE BEEN ASKING A QUESTION
FOR TEN MINUTES.
PLEASE SIT DOWN.
>> I'M ASK ING YOU, HOW DID THOE
IMPACT YOUR OPINIONS ON THE 
ALLEGATIONS -- 
>> WELL, IT DOES IMPACT MY 
OPINION, BECAUSE I'VE HAD A LOT 
OF FALSE CHARGES MADE AGAINST 
ME.
I'M A VERY FAMOUS PERSON, 
UNFORTUNATELY.
I'VE BEEN A FAMOUS PERSON FOR A 
LONG TIME.
BUT I'VE HAD A LOT OF FALSE 
CHARGES MADE AGAINST ME.
REALLY FALSE CHARGES.
I KNOW FRIENDS THAT HAVE HAD 
FALSE CHARGES.
PEOPLE WANT FAME, THEY WANT 
MONEY, THEY WANT WHATEVER.
SO, WHEN I SEE IT, I VIEW IT 
DIFFERENTLY THAN SOMEBODY AT 
HOME SITTING AT HOME WATCHING 
TELEVISION WHERE THEY SAY, OH, 
JUDGE KAVANAUGH THIS OR THAT.
IT'S HAPPENED TO ME MANY TIMES.
I'VE HAD MANY FALSE CHARGES.
I HAD A WOMAN SITTING IN AN 
AIRPLANE AND I ATTACKED HER 
WHILE PEOPLE WERE COMING ON THE 
PLANE AND I HAVE A NUMBER ONE 
BEST SELLER OUT?
IT WAS A TOTAL PHONY STORY.
THERE ARE MANY OF THEM.
SO, WHEN YOU SAY, DOES IT AFFECT
ME IN TERMS OF MY THINKING IN 
RESPECT TO JUDGE KAVANAUGH, 
ABSOLUTELY, BECAUSE I'VE HAD IT 
MANY TIMES, AND IF THE NEWS 
WOULD HAVE REPORTED THESE FOUR 
PEOPLE, I COULDN'T BELIEVE IT, 
WHEN I HEARD THAT THEY CAUGHT 
THESE FOUR PEOPLE, I SAID, WOW, 
THAT'S A BIG STORY.
AND IT WAS, FOR FOX.
OKAY.
>> THANK YOU, MR. PRESIDENT.
EARLIER TODAY, AND JUST NOW, YOU
MADE A SIGNIFICANT ALLEGATION 
AGAINST THE CHINESE GOVERNMENT.
YOU SUGGESTED THAT THE CHINESE 
HAD MEDDLED IN OR ARE 
MEDDLING -- 
>> THAT'S RIGHT.
THAT'S WHAT I HEARD.
>> WHAT EVIDENCE DO YOU HAVE OF 
THAT, SIR?
>> WE HAVE EVIDENCE.
WE HAVE EVIDENCE.
IT WILL COME OUT.
I CAN'T TELL YOU NOW, BUT IT 
DIDN'T COME OUT OF NOWHERE, THAT
I CAN TELL YOU.
THEY'VE ACTUALLY ADMITTED THAT 
THEY'RE GOING AFTER FARMERS.
I THINK MOST OF YOU CAN COVER 
THAT, I LIKE THAT YOU'RE SHAKING
YOUR HEAD, YES, I'M GOING TO ASK
YOU THE NEXT QUESTION BECAUSE OF
THAT, OKAY?
PROBABLY GOING TO BE THE KILLER 
OF ALL QUESTIONS.
>> WHY MAKE THE CHARGE NOW IF 
YOU'RE NOT GOING TO COME FORWARD
WITH THE EVIDENCE?
>> CHINA NOW PUT ON $250 BILLION
AND THEY'RE PAYING 25% ON THAT, 
THEY'RE PAYING BILLIONS -- THIS 
HAS NEVER HAPPENED TO CHINA.
AND I LIKE CHINA, AND I LIKE 
PRESIDENT XI A LOT.
I THINK HE'S A FRIEND OF MINE.
HE MAY NOT BE ANYMORE, BUT I 
THINK HE PROBABLY RESPECTS -- 
FROM WHAT I HEAR, IF YOU LOOK AT
MR. PILLSBURY, THE LEADING 
AUTHORITY ON CHINA, HE WAS ON A 
SHOW, I WON'T MENTION THE NAME 
OF THE SHOW, RECENTLY, AND HE 
WAS SAYING THAT CHINA HAS TOTAL 
RESPECT FOR DONALD TRUMP AND FOR
DONALD TRUMP'S VERY, VERY LARGE 
BRAIN.
HE SAID DONALD TRUMP -- THEY 
DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO.
NEVER HAPPENED.
WELL, ONE THING THEY'RE TRYING 
TO DO IS,THEY'RE TRYING TO 
CONVINCE PEOPLE TO GO AGAINST 
DONALD TRUMP.
A NORMAL PERSON WHO HAS NO 
CONCEPT OF WHAT THE HELL HE'S 
DOING WOULD CONTINUE TO LET 
CHINA CONTINUE TO TAKE MONEY OUT
OF OUR COUNTRY.
THEY WERE BUILDING 29 MASSIVE 
BRIDGES, LIKE THE GEORGE 
WASHINGTON BRIDGE, THEY ARE 
BUILDING THINGS THAT WE DON'T 
BUILD ANYMORE.
BUT WE'RE STARTING TO BUILD THEM
AGAIN.
AND OUR ECONOMY NOW IS HOTTER 
THAN IT'S EVER BEEN.
I DON'T KNOW IF YOU SAW THE 
CONFIDENCE LEVELS THIS MORNING 
THAT JUST CAME OUT, FANTASTIC.
AND IN ALL FAIRNESS TO THE FED 
RAISING RATES, THEY'RE RAISING 
RATES BECAUSE WE'VE NEVER DONE 
LIKE WE'RE DOING NOW.
AND ONE OF THE THINGS THAT IS 
NICE ABOUT THE RATES, THE PEOPLE
THAT WERE HURT THE WORST BY 
THESE ZERO INTEREST RATES, YOU 
KNOW, WHEN PRESIDENT OBAMA HAD 
AN ECONOMY THAT WAS -- IT WAS 
THE WORST COMEBACK SINCE THE 
GREAT DEPRESSION AND YOU'VE ALL 
HEARD THAT, BUT REMEMBER, HE WAS
PLAYING WITH ZERO INTEREST 
MONEY.
HE WAS PLAYING WITH FUNNY MONEY.
THAT'S EASY.
I'M PLAYING WITH FAIRLY 
EXPENSIVE MONEY.
SO, WHEN HE DOES THAT, THE 
PEOPLE THAT BENEFIT ARE PEOPLE 
THAT ACTUALLY, IN THEIR WHOLE 
LIFE, THEY WOULD SAVE 10%, 15%, 
20% OF THEIR SALARY, THOSE 
PEOPLE GOT KILLED, BECAUSE THEY 
PUT THEIR MONEY IN THE BANK, 
THEY WERE GOING TO LIVE OFF THE 
INTEREST AND THERE WAS NO 
INTEREST.
NOW THOSE PEOPLE ARE STARTING TO
GET INTEREST, AND THOSE ARE THE 
PEOPLE, FRANKLY, THAT DESERVE 
TO, YOU KNOW, THEY DID A GREAT 
JOB.
THE PEOPLE THAT DID IT RIGHT, 
THE PEOPLE THAT DID THE BEST JOB
GOT HURT THE MOST.
SO, IN ONE SENSE, I LIKE IT, BUT
BASICALLY, I'M A LOW INTEREST 
RATE PERSON.
YES, MA'AM?
YES, GO AHEAD.
>> MR. PRESIDENT, YOU HAVE 
ANOTHER MEETING TOMORROW WITH 
ROD ROSENSTEIN.
>> YES. 
>> ARE YOU PLANNING TO FIRE ROD 
ROSENSTEIN?
>> I'M TALKING TO HIM.
WE'VE HAD A GOOD TALK.
HE SAID HE NEVER SAID IT.
HE SAID HE DOESN'T BELIEVE IT, 
HE SAID HE HAS A LOT OF RESPECT 
FOR ME.
AND HE WAS VERY NICE AND WE'LL 
SEE.
AND HE'S A MEMBER OF THE TRUMP 
ADMINISTRATION IN THAT SENSE, IN
THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT, I WOULD 
CERTAINLY PREFER NOT DOING THAT.
THERE WAS NO COLLUSION, THERE 
WAS NO OBSTRUCTION, UNLESS YOU 
CALL OBSTRUCTION THE FACT THAT I
FIGHT BACK, I DO FIGHT BACK, I 
REALLY FIGHT BACK.
I MEAN, IF YOU CALL THAT 
OBSTRUCTION, THAT'S FINE.
BUT THERE'S NO OBSTRUCTION, 
THERE'S NO COLLUSION.
I'M GOING TO MEET WITH HIM 
TOMORROW.
I MAY CALL ROD TONIGHT OR 
TOMORROW AND ASK FOR A LITTLE 
BIT OF A DELAY TO THE MEETING 
BECAUSE I DON'T WANT TO DO 
ANYTHING THAT GETS IN THE WAY OF
THIS VERY IMPORTANT SUPREME 
COURT PICK.
SO, I DON'T WANT IT COMPETING 
AND HURTING THE DECISION, ONE 
WAY OR THE OTHER, DECISION.
AGAIN, I WANT TO HEAR WHAT SHE 
HAS TO SAY.
BUT I DON'T WANT -- SO, I MAY 
DELAY THAT.
I'M GOING TO SEE.
I DON'T WANT TO DO ANYTHING 
THAT'S GOING TO CONFLICT WITH 
THAT.
BUT MY PREFERENCE WOULD BE TO 
KEEP HIM.
AND TO LET HIM FINISH UP, YOU 
KNOW, I CALLED IT A WITCH HUNT.
AND IT IS A WITCH HUNT.
IF YOU LOOK AT THE FBI 
STATEMENTS WITH STRZOK AND HIS 
LOVER, LISA PAGE, IF YOU LOOK AT
ALL THE THINGS THAT HAVE GONE ON
IN THE FBI, IF YOU LOOK AT 
McCABE TAKING $700,000 FROM A 
HILLARY CLINTON PAC, 
ESSENTIALLY, RUN BY TERRY 
McAULIFFE, WHO IS HER BEST 
FRIEND IN THE WORLD, HE GIVES 
THEM HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF 
DOLLARS AND HE'S IN CHARGE OF 
HER CAMPAIGN AND HIS WIFE IS 
GETTING ALL OF THIS MONEY TO 
RUN, SHE LOST, I MEAN, WHAT'S 
GOING ON?
IF YOU LOOK AT THE HORRIBLE 
STATEMENTS, LIKE, WAY TO GO, 
PAGE, GREAT STORY YOU PUT INTO A
NEWSPAPER, NOW WE'LL GO AND 
INVESTIGATE THAT GROUP.
IT'S TERRIBLE.
WE HAVE CAUGHT PEOPLE DOING 
THINGS THAT ARE TERRIBLE.
I WOULD MUCH PREFER KEEPING ROD 
ROSENSTEIN, MUCH PREFER.
MANY PEOPLE SAY I HAVE THE RIGHT
TO ABSOLUTELY FIRE HIM, HE SAID 
HE DID NOT SAY IT, HE SAID HE 
DOES NOT BELIEVE THAT, AND 
NOBODY IN THIS ROOM BELIEVES IT,
BY THE WAY.
I DEAL WITH THE PEOPLE IN THIS 
ROOM.
I WAS WITH MIKE POMPEO BEFORE, 
WE WERE DEALING WITH A VERY HIGH
LEVEL WITH JAPAN AND I WAS 
SAYING THINGS THAT NOBODY IN THE
ROOM EVEN UNDERSTOOD AND I SAID 
THEM A LONG TIME AGO AND I WAS 
RIGHT.
HE SAID, THAT'S NOT THE 25th 
AMENDMENT I'M LOOKING AT.
>> YOU DON'T THINK ANYONE IN 
YOUR ADMINISTRATION HAS 
DISCUSSED USING THE 25th 
AMENDMENT AGAINST YOU.
>> ENEMIES -- 
>> WITHIN YOUR ADMINISTRATION IN
YOUR CABINET?
>> THEY'RE NOT IN LOVE WITH ME.
THEY'RE NOT GOING TO BEAT ME IN 
THE ELECTION, THEY KNOW THAT.
THEY'RE NOT GOING TO BEAT ME.
THE PEOPLE THAT I'M LOOKING AT 
ARE TOTAL LIGHTWEIGHTS.
I DREAM OF RUNNING AGAINST THOSE
PEOPLE.
>> WITHIN YOUR ADMINISTRATION?
>> THEY'RE NOT GOING TO BEAT ME.
I'M AGAINST WHAT THEY WANT TO 
DO.
I'M IN FAVOR OF LAW ENFORCEMENT,
I'M IN FAVOR OF SAFETY AND 
SECURITY AND LOW TAXES, I WANT 
LOW TAXES.
I WANT BORDERS.
WE'RE GETTING ANOTHER 1.6 
BILLION IN BORDERS.
I WANT BORDERS.
WE'VE SPENT 3.2 AND WE'RE 
GETTING ANOTHER 1.6 AND THEN 
WE'LL GET THE WHOLE THING AND 
COMPLETE THE WALL.
THEY DON'T WANT THAT.
THEY DON'T WANT THAT.
THEY DON'T WANT THE THINGS THAT 
I HAVE.
NOW, I MUST SAY, I KNOW MANY OF 
THE DEMOCRATS, THEY'LL SAY 
THINGS AND THEN WINK AT ME.
AND AGAIN, IT'S THE SAME OLD 
STORY.
THEY'LL SAY THINGS, THEY DON'T 
MEAN IT.
IT'S POLITICS.
THE REASON THEY DON'T WANT ME IS
BECAUSE THEY WANT TO RUN THE 
SHOW.
THEY WANT IT.
IT'S POWER, IT'S WHOEVER YOU 
WANT TO CALL IT.
BUT WHAT THEY'VE DONE HERE IS A 
DISGRACE, A TOTAL DISGRACE.
AND WHAT THEY DO -- I KNOW IT'S 
SORT OF INTERESTING, IN ONE 
CASE, THEY SAY, HE'S A FASCIST, 
HE'S TAKING OVER THE GOVERNMENT,
HE'S THE MOST POWERFUL PRESIDENT
EVER, HE'S A HORRIBLE HUMAN 
BEING, HE WANTS TO TAKE OVER THE
ENTIRE GOVERNMENT AND HE'S GOING
TO DO IT, WE CAN'T STOP HIM.
THAT DIDN'T WORK.
THE NEXT WEEK, HE SAID, AH, HE'S
INCOMPETENT.
IN ONE CASE, I'M TAKING OVER THE
WORLD AND THE OTHER CASE, HE'S 
INCOMPETENT.
THEY TRIED THAT FOR A WEEK, THAT
DIDN'T WORK.
LOOK.
THESE ARE VERY DISHONEST PEOPLE.
THESE ARE CON ARTISTS.
AND THE PRESS KNOWS IT, BUT THE 
PRESS DOESN'T WRITE IT.
WOW.
THAT'S A LOT OF HANDS.
THAT'S A LOT OF -- STEVE, GO 
AHEAD.
HERE'S A VERY HIGH QUALITY 
PERSON, THIS MAN, BUT HE'LL 
PROBABLY HIT ME WITH A BAD ONE.
GO AHEAD, GIVE IT TO ME.
>> YOU'RE GETTING LETTERS FROM 
CHAIRMAN KIM, WHY DO YOU NEED A 
SECOND SUMMIT WITH THE NORTH 
KOREAN LEADER SO SOON?
AND WHAT -- 
>> BECAUSE EIDEHE'D LIKE IT.
>> AND WHAT WOULD IT BE FOR?
>> SO, I'VE RECEIVED TWO LETTERS
FROM CHAIRMAN KIM.
THEY'RE INCREDIBLE LETTERS.
THEY'RE LETTERS THAT ARE 
MAGNIFICENT IN THE SENSE OF HIS 
FEELING FOR WANTING TO GET THIS 
DONE.
I REALLY BELIEVE HE WANTS TO GET
IT DONE.
I MAY BE WRONG.
I HEARD SOMEBODY ON A NERCERTAI 
NETWORK LAST NIGHT SAY WHY HAS 
PRESIDENT TRUMP GIVEN SO MUCH TO
NORTH KOREA, I SAID, WAIT A 
MINUTE.
I ASKED SARAH HUCKABEE, PLEASE 
CALL THIS PERSON.
I GAVE NOTHING, OTHER THAN A 
MET.
WHAT DID I GIVE HIM?
I DIDN'T DO WHAT OBAMA DID, GIVE
HIM $1.8 BILLION IN CASH TO GET 
BACK FOUR HOSTAGES.
I GOT BACK OUR HOSTAGES, I NEVER
PAID THEM ANYTHING.
I HAVEN'T PAID THEM 10 CENTS.
BUT HE WANTS TO MAKE A DEAL AND 
I'D LIKE TO MAUCK A DEAL.
WE ACTUALLY HAVE A VERY GOOD 
RELATIONSHIP.
A LOT DIFFERENT THAN THE LAST 
TIME WE WERE AT THE UNITED 
NATIONS.
THAT WAS A LITTLE BIT ROUGH.
DON'T FORGET, THAT TIME, THEY 
SAID, OH, TRUMP IS SAYING THESE 
HORRIBLE THINGS, HE'S GOING TO 
GET US INTO A WAR.
YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE A WAR IF I 
WASN'T ELECTED, YOU'D BE IN A 
WAR.
AND PRESIDENT OBAMA ESSENTIALLY 
SAID THE SAME THING.
HE WAS READY TO GO TO WAR.
YOU WOULD HAVE HAD A WAR AND YOU
WOULD HAVE LOST MILLIONS, NOT 
THOUSANDS, YOU WOULD HAVE LOST 
MILLIONS OF PEOPLE.
SEOUL HAS 30 MILLION PEOPLE 40 
MILES AND 30 MILES FROM THIS 
VERY DANGEROUS BORDER.
IF I WASN'T ELECTED, YOU WOULD 
HAVE HAD A WAR.
PRESIDENT OBAMA THOUGHT YOU HAD 
TO GO TO WAR.
YOU KNOW HOW CLOSE HE WAS TO 
PRESSING THE TRIGGER FOR WAR?
MILLIONS OF PEOPLE.
WITH ME, NOBODY'S TALKING ABOUT 
THAT.
NOBODY'S TALKING ABOUT THAT.
WE HAVE A VERY GOOD 
RELATIONSHIP.
HE LIKES ME, I LIKE HIM, WE GET 
ALONG.
HE WROTE ME TWO OF THE MOST 
BEAUTIFUL LETTERS.
WHEN I SHOWED ONE OF THE 
LETTERS, JUST ONE, TO PRIME 
MINISTER ABE, HE SAID, THIS IS 
ACTUALLY A GROUNDBREAKING 
LETTER.
THIS IS AN INCREDIBLE -- THIS IS
AN HISTORIC LETTER, AND IT IS.
IT'S A BEAUTIFUL -- IT'S A 
BEAUTIFUL PIECE OF ART.
AND I THINK WE'RE GOING TO MAKE 
A DEAL.
WILL WE MAKE A DEAL, STEVE, I 
DON'T REALLY KNOW, BUT I THINK 
WE'RE GOING TO -- IN THE 
MEANTIME, AND I'VE SAID IT, I 
DON'T WANT TO BORE YOU, NO 
ROCKETS, NO MISSILES, NO NUCLEAR
TESTS.
YOU KNOW, FOR OVER A YEAR.
WELL, YOU HAVEN'T SEEN.
BEFORE I GOT HERE, EVERYBODY IN 
THE ROOM THOUGHT YOU WERE GOING 
TO WAR.
AND THEN WHAT HAPPENED, IT WAS 
FUNNY.
THEY SAID, HE WAS TERRIBLE, HE 
WAS SO ROUGH WITH CHAIRMAN KIM, 
KIM JONG-UN.
HE WAS SO ROUGH, IT'S TERRIBLE.
WELL, I HAD A GREAT MEETING WITH
PRESIDENT PEWUPUTIN.
AND ON THIS ONE, HE SAID, HE WAS
TOO SOFT ON PRESIDENT PUTIN.
WE DISCUSSED EVERYTHING.
UKRAINE, SYRIA, ISRAEL AND 
ISRAEL'S PROTECTION, WE HAD A 
GREAT MEETING.
THEY WANTED ME TO END UP IN A 
BOXING MATCH.
AND, YOU KNOW WHAT?
IF I WAS KILLER TOUGH WITH 
PRESIDENT PUTIN, THEY WOULD HAVE
SAID, HE WAS TOO TOUGH.
YOU CAN'T WIN WITH THESE PEOPLE,
BUT YOU JUST KEEP GOING.
>> HOW LONG DO YOU THINK IT 
SHOULD TAKE NORTH CKOREA TO 
DENUCLEARIZE?
>> STEVE, I DON'T WANT TO GET 
INTO THE TIME GAME, YOU THOUGH 
WHY?
I TOLD MIKE POMPEO, I SAID, 
MIKE, DON'T GET INTO THE TIME 
GAME.
WE STOPPED THEM, THEY'RE TAKING 
DOWN PLANTS, THEY'RE TAKING DOWN
A LOT OF DIFFERENT TESTING 
AREAS, THEY'RE GOING TO TAKE 
DOWN SOME MORE, YOU'LL BE 
HEARING ABOUT THAT VERY SOON, I 
DON'T WANT TO GO AHEAD OF 
MYSELF, BUT YOU'LL BE HEARING 
ABOUT IT SOON.
THEY HAVE NO INTEREST RIGHT NOW 
IN TESTING NUCLEAR -- YOU KNOW, 
WE HAD A CASE JUST ABOUT WHEN I 
WAS COMING INTO OFFICE, YOU'LL 
REMEMBER IT, WHERE THERE WAS A 
MASSIVE, THEY THOUGHT IT WAS AN 
EARTHQUAKE.
A MOUNTAIN MOVED OVER AN INCH 
AND A HALF.
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT MOUNTAINS.
NORTH KOREA IS VERY MOUNTAINOUS,
BEAUTIFUL LAND.
THIS MOUNTAIN ACTUALLY SHIFTED.
IT SHIFTED.
AND SOMEBODY THOUGHT IT WAS AN 
EARTHQUAKE AND THEY FOUND OUT, 
NO, THIS WAS NUCLEAR TESTING.
SHIFTED A MOUNTAIN.
I'M TALKING ABOUT SERIOUS STUFF.
SERIOUS SIZE.
WHEN I CAME IN AND CERTAINLY 
BEFORE I CAME IN, AND EVEN AT 
THE BEGINNING OF MINE, BECAUSE I
WAS HAVING RHETORICAL, YOU KNOW,
CONTESTS EARLY, I GUESS YOU 
COULD CALL IT, WITH CHAIRMAN 
KIM, WHICH WE BOTH SMILE AT NOW 
AND WE LAUGH AT, BUT EVERYBODY 
THOUGHT THAT WAS A HORRIBLE 
THING.
WE'VE HAD MANY PRESIDENTS, WERE 
UNABLE TO DO ANYTHING.
ANYTHING AT ALL WITH NORTH 
KOREA.
WE NOW HAVE A GOOD RELATIONSHIP.
WE HAVE A GOOD RELATIONSHIP.
AND MOST IMPORTANTLY, ALL OF THE
THINGS THAT YOU'VE BEEN HEARING 
ABOUT THE HORROR STORIES, IN MY 
OPINION, THEY'RE DONE.
COULD THEY START UP AGAIN, YES.
I'M A DEAL GUY.
COULD THEY START?
YES.
COULD BE WE DON'T WORK IT OUT.
I THINK I HAVE IT RIGHT HERE.
I THINK THAT WHAT WE'VE DONE 
BEHIND THE SCENES, WHICH NOBODY 
REALLY KNOWS ABOUT, I DON'T 
BLAME YOU FOR NOT KNOWING ABOUT,
YOU KNOW, PERSONAL LETTERS, 
PRIVATE LETTERS, BUT SAYING THEY
WANT TO GET IT DONE.
WE KNOW MUCH MORE THAN THE MEDIA
FOR A CHANGE, MUCH MORE, BUT IF 
YOU SAW WHAT'S GOING ON BEHIND 
THE SCENES, I THINK YOU'D BE 
VERY IMPRESSED.
WE WERE A COUNTRY GOING TO WAR.
I REALLY BELIEVE THAT PRESIDENT 
OBAMA WOULD ADMIT THAT HE SAID 
IT'S BEEN FAR HIS BIGGEST 
PROBLEM.
WHEN I SAT WITH HIM PRIOR TO 
GOING TO OFFICE, GOING INTO 
OFFICE, HE SAID TO ME THAT'S BY 
FAR THE BIGGEST PROBLEM, AND HE 
SAID TO ME THAT HE WAS VERY 
CLOSE TO GOING INTO WAR.
AND MILLIONS OF PEOPLE -- NOT, 
YOU KNOW, THEY SAY, OH, 
THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE -- NO, NOT 
THOUSANDS.
MILLIONS OF PEOPLE WOULD HAVE 
BEEN KILLED, AND THAT COULD HAVE
LEFT -- YOU'RE RIGHT NEXT TO 
CHINA, THAT COULD HAVE BEEN A 
WORLD WAR VERY EASILY.
RIGHT NOW WE'RE IN A GREAT 
POSITION.
I DON'T WANT TO PLAY THE TIME 
GAME.
I TOLD MIKE POMPEO, DON'T LET 
THEM DO THAT TO YOU.
I HAVEN'T GIVEN ANYTHING.
AND ALL OF A SUDDEN, WE GOT 
BACK, A FEW WEEKS AGO, I THINK 
WE WERE BACK, LIKE, TWO AND A 
HALF MONTHS FROM THE SUMMIT, 
WHICH WAS A GREAT SUCCESS, AND 
PEOPLE ARE SCREAMING, WHAT'S 
TAKING SO LONG?
I SAID, OH, I GET IT.
YOU HAVE TO UNDERSTAND THE 
MEDIA, I'VE BEEN DEALING WITH 
THE MEDIA ALL MY LIFE, TOO MUCH,
TOO MUCH.
THEY'RE SCREAMING AND I SAW THAT
AND OUR GUYS WERE -- AND NOT 
MIKE, BUT OUR GUYS WERE BEING, 
WELL, WE'RE WORKI ING AS FAST -I
SAID, I GOT ALL THE TIME IN THE 
WORLD.
I DON'T HAVE TO RUSH IT.
THERE'S NO, YOU KNOW, CESSATION 
OF SANCTIONS.
I DIDN'T TAKE ANY SANCTIONS OFF.
I DID SEE A REPORTER LAST NIGHT,
I GUY A LIKE PERSONALLY A LOT.
AND HE ASKED A QUESTION TO 
PRESIDENT MOON OF SOUTH KOREA, 
HE SAID, WHY DID THE PRESIDENT 
GIVE SO MUCH?
I DIDN'T GIVE ANYTHING.
I GAVE NOTHING.
WHAT I HAVE I GIVEN?
OTHER THAN SOME TIME.
YES.
I FLEW TO SINGAPORE, WE HAD A 
MEETING.
NOW, GIVING WOULD BE IF I TOOK 
THE SANCTIONS OFF.
I DIDN'T WANT TO DO -- IF YOU 
ASK GENERAL MATTIS, FOR A YEAR 
AND A HALF, I SAID, WHY DON'T WE
STOP THESE RIDICULOUS, IN MY 
OPINION, THE MILITARY GAMES, I 
CALL THEM THE MILITARY GAMES.
IF I TOLD YOU HOW MUCH THOSE 
GAMES COST, AND FRANKLY, I TOLD 
SOUTH KOREA, YOU SHOULD BE 
PAYING FOR THESE GAMES.
WE PAY FOR THEM.
THEY SAID, WELL, WE FLY THE 
PLANES IN FROM A SHORT DISTANCE 
AWAY.
WHERE IS THAT?
GUAM.
HOW LONG A TRIP IS THAT?
SEVEN HOURS.
WE'RE FLYING MASSIVE BOMBERS.
I WANTED TO STOP THIS FOR A LONG
TIME.
I CONSIDER THAT AN ASSET.
BUT WE'RE SAVING, BY THE WAY, 
JUST FOR THE TAXPAYER, WE'RE 
SAVING A FORTUNE.
AND IF WE NEED THEM, WE CAN 
START THEM UP IMMEDIATELY.
IF I THINK WE NEED THEM, I'LL 
START THEM BEFORE THE GENERALS 
WILL START THEM.
THE FACT IS, THIS REPORTER SAID 
THAT, I SAID WHAT HAVE WE DONE?
I HAVEN'T GIVEN ANYTHING.
AND WE'RE REALLY ONTO THE CUSP, 
I THINK WE'RE REALLY GOING TO DO
SOMETHING THAT'S GOING TO BE 
VERY IMPORTANT.
BUT WE'RE NOT PLAYING THE TIME 
GAME.
IF IT TAKES TWO YEARS, THREE 
YEARS OR FIVE MONTHS, DOESN'T 
MATTER.
THERE'S NO NUCLEAR TESTING AND 
THERE'S NO TESTING OF ROCKETS.
YES, MA'AM, GO AHEAD.
GO AHEAD.
PLEASE.
THIS IS THE ONE THAT WAS NODDING
WITH EVERY NICE THING I SAID, 
SO, WATCH THIS QUESTION.
>> FROM SKY NEWS.
>> OKAY, GOOD, SKY NEWS.
CONGRATULATIONS ON THE PURCHASE.
>> NOTHING TO DO WITH ME.
>> I HOPE YOU BENEFITED.
GO AHEAD.
>> ARE YOU AT ALL CONCERNED 
ABOUT THE MESSAGE THAT IS BEING 
SENT TO THE WOMEN WHO ARE 
WATCHING THIS WHEN YOU USE 
LANGUAGE LIKE CON JOB IN 
RELATION TO ALLEGATIONS OF 
SEXUAL -- 
>> I'VE USED MUCH WORSE 
LANGUAGE.
THAT'S PROBABLY THE NICEST 
PHRASE I'VE USED.
CON JOB.
IT'S A CON JOB BY THE DEMOCRATS.
THEY KNOW IT.
>> WHAT ABOUT THE MESSAGE THAT'S
BEING SENT TO WOMEN -- 
>> THEY DID THE SAME THING WITH 
THE RUSSIA INVESTIGATION.
THEY TRIED TO CONVINCE PEOPLE 
THAT I HAD SOMETHING TO DO WITH 
RUSSIA.
THERE WAS NO COLLUSION.
THINK OF IT.
I'M IN WISCONSIN, I'M IN 
MICHIGAN, I SAY, GEE, WE'RE NOT 
DOING WELL, I WON BOTH THOSE 
STATES.
WE'RE NOT DOING WELL.
AH, LET ME CALL THE RUSSIANS TO 
HELP.
DOES ANYBODY REALLY BELIEVE 
THAT?
IT'S A CON JOB.
AND I WATCH THESE GUYS, LITTLE 
ADAM SCHIFF AND ALL THE GUYS, HE
TAKES A CALL FROM A RUSSIAN WHO 
TURNED OUT TO BE A FAKER, YOU 
KNOW, HE WAS A COMEDIAN OR 
SOMETHING.
THIS IS SO AND SO CALLING.
WHY IS HE TAKING A CALL FROM A 
RUSSIAN?
SENATOR WARNER TOOK A CALL FROM 
A RUSSIAN.
HE WAS A COMEDIAN OR SOMETHING.
BUT HE SAID, WE HAVE PICTURES OF
PRESIDENT TRUMP -- OH, WHERE CAN
I GET THEM?
IF WE EVER DID THAT IT WOULD BE 
LIKE A BIG DEAL.
YEAH, IT'S A CON JOB.
AND IT'S NOT A BAD TERM.
IT'S NOT A BAD TERM AT ALL.
I'LL TELL YOU ONE THING I CAN 
SAY.
I'VE HAD A LOT OF PEOPLE TALKING
ABOUT THIS TO ME WITH RESPECT TO
WHAT'S HAPPENING, BECAUSE IT'S A
HORRIBLE PRECEDENT.
I'M GOING TO HAVE TO GET OTHER 
JUDGES AND OTHER SUPREME COURT 
JUDGES, POSSIBLY.
I COULD HAVE A LOT OF SUPREME 
COURT JUDGES, MORE THAN TWO.
AND WHEN I CALLED UP BRETT 
KAVANAUGH, SPOKE TO HIM AND HIS 
FAMILY AND TOLD THEM THAT I 
CHOSE THEM, THEY WERE SO HAPPY 
AND SO HONORED, IT WAS AS 
THOUGH, I MEAN, THE BIGGEST 
THING THAT'S EVER HAPPENED, AND 
I UNDERSTAND THAT.
U.S. SUPREME COURT.
I DON'T WANT TO BE IN A POSITION
WHERE PEOPLE SAY NO THANKS, NO 
THANKS, YOU KNOW, I -- I SPOKE 
TO SOMEBODY 38 YEARS AGO AND IT 
MAY NOT BE GOOD.
WE HAVE A COUNTRY TO RUN.
WE WANT THE BEST TALENT IN THE 
WORLD.
BUT I'LL TELL YOU THIS, THE 
PEOPLE THAT HAVE COMPLAINED TO 
ME ABOUT IT THE MOST ABOUT 
WHAT'S HAPPENING ARE WOMEN.
WOMEN ARE VERY ANGRY.
YOU KNOW, I GOT 52% WITH WOMEN, 
EVERYONE SAID THIS COULDN'T 
HAPPEN, 52%.
WOMEN ARE SO ANGRY.
AND I FRANKLY THINK THAT -- I 
THINK THEY LIKE WHAT THE 
REPUBLICANS ARE DOING, BUT I 
THINK THEY WOULD HAVE LIKED TO 
HAVE SEEN IT GO A LOT FASTER.
BUT GIVE THEM THEIR DAY IN 
COURT, LET SOMEBODY ELSE HAVE A 
DAY IN COURT.
BUT THE ONES THAT I FIND -- I 
MEAN, I HAVE MEN THAT DON'T LIKE
IT, BUT I HAVE WOMEN THAT ARE 
INCENSED AT WHAT'S GOING ON.
I'VE ALWAYS SAID WOMEN ARE 
SMARTER THAN MEN.
I'VE SAID THAT A LOT.
AND I MEAN IT.
BUT WOMEN -- WOMEN ARE INCENSED 
AT WHAT'S GOING ON.
YES, GO AHEAD.
GO AHEAD.
GO AHEAD, IN THE BACK.
WHO ARE YOU, WHERE ARE YOU 
FROM -- YEAH, YOU.
GUY LOOKS LIKE HE'S SHOCKED.
THIS IS GOING TO BE NOT GOOD.
GUY LOOKS TOTALLY STUNNED.
HAVE YOU EVER BEEN PICKED BEFORE
FOR A QUESTION?
>> YES, SIR, BUT NOT FROM THE 
PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
I WANT TO, SIR, ASK Y-- 
>> YOU SAID FROM WHERE?
>> FROM NORTHERN IRAQ, I'M A 
KURD.
>> GREAT PEOPLE, GREAT PEOPLE.
>> MR. PRESIDENT -- 
>> ARE YOU A KURD?
>> MR. PRESIDENT -- 
>> THEY'RE GREAT PEOPLE, THEY'RE
GREAT FIGHTERS.
I LIKE THEM A LOT.
I LIKE THIS QUESTION.
>> MR. PRESIDENT, YOU ALWAYS SAY
YOU SUPPORT YOUR ALLIES.
KURDS RIGHT NOW, AFTER THE 
DEFEAT OF ISIS, ARE UNDER A LOT 
OF PRESSURE IN SYRIA AND IN IRAQ
BY MANY ADVERSARIES.
WHAT WILL YOU DO TO ELEVATE 
THEIR POSITION TO SUPPORT THEM, 
AFTER THEY HELPED THE UNITED 
STATES TO DEFEAT ISIS?
>> WELL, WE ARE HELPING THEM A 
LOT AND WE'VE BEEN VERY FRIENDLY
WITH THEM.
AS YOU KNOW, WE'VE FOUGHT 
SIDE-BY-SIDE AND WE HAVE 
DEFEATED ISIS, ESSENTIALLY, VERY
SHORT WHILE AGO, IN THE MIDDLE 
EAST.
AND WE DID IT WITH A LOT OF HELP
FROM THE KURDS.
AND THEY ARE, THEY'RE GREAT 
FIGHTERS.
YOU KNOW, SOME PEOPLE ARE GREAT 
FIGHTERS AND SOME PEOPLE AREN'T.
THE KURDS ARE GREAT FIGHTERS AND
GREAT, GREAT PEOPLE.
WE'RE DISCUSSING THAT SITUATION 
EXACTLY RIGHT NOW.
>> WHAT WILL YOU DO TO SUPPORT 
THEM?
>> I'M JUST TELLING YOU, WE'RE 
GOING TO BE DISCUSSING THAT 
SITUATION.
WE HAVE ALREADY STARTED 
DISCUSSING THAT SITUATION, BUT 
WE HAVE HAD TREMENDOUS SUPPORT 
FROM THE KURDS IN DEFEATING 
ISIS.
>> AND ABOUT SYRIA, SIR, IN YOUR
SPEECH -- 
>> AH, YES, GO.
UH-OH.
YOU DON'T NEED IT.
>> MR. PRESIDENT, SUSAN LEE FROM
FOX BUSINESS.
DID YOU REJECT A ONE-ON-ONE 
MEETING WITH THE CANADIAN PRIME 
MINISTER?
>> YEAH, I DID.
>> WHY?
>> BECAUSE HIS TARIFFS ARE TOO 
HIGH AND HE DOESN'T SEEM TO WANT
TO MOVE AND I TOLD HIM FORGET 
ABOUT IT.
AND FRANKLY, WE'RE THINKING 
ABOUT JUST TAXING CARS COMING IN
FROM CANADA.
THAT'S THE BIG ONE.
WE'RE VERY UNHAPPY WITH THE 
NEGOTIATIONS AND THE NEGOTIATING
STYLE OF CANADA.
WE DON'T LIKE THEIR 
REPRESENTATIVE VERY MUCH.
THEY'VE TAKEN -- I LOVE CANADA, 
BY THE WAY, I HAVE EVERYBODY, SO
MANY FRIENDS, BUT THAT HAS 
NOTHING TO DO WITH THIS.
I'M RESPPRESENTING THE UNITED 
STATES.
MEXICO WAS TOTALLY, I MEAN, THEY
WERE GREAT.
BY THE WAY, THE NEW PRESIDENT 
HAS BEEN GREAT.
THE DEAL IS DONE.
NOW IT HAS TO GO THROUGH 
CONGRESS AND A LOT OF THINGS 
HAVE TO HAPPEN, BUT WE'VE DONE, 
BOB LIGHTHIZER, WHO IS HERE SOME
PLACE, WHERE'S BOB?
BOB LIGHTHIZER'S DONE A GREAT 
JOB OF NEGOTIATING, AS THEY 
HAVE, BUT THE DEAL IS DONE.
>> MR. PRESIDENT -- 
>> BUT CANADA HAS TREATED US 
VERY BADLY.
THEY'VE TREATED OUR FARMERS IN 
WISCONSIN AND NEW YORK STATE AND
A LOT OF OTHER STATES VERY 
BADLY.
DAIRY PRODUCTS, 300%.
300%.
HOW DO YOU SELL A DAIRY PRODUCT 
AT 300%?
THE ANSWER IS, YOU DON'T.
WHAT IT IS IS A BARRIER.
IT'S BASICALLY, THEY'RE SAYING, 
WE DON'T HAVE ANY BARRIERS, BY 
THE WAY, IT'S 300%, YOU DON'T 
SEND IT IN BECAUSE YOU CAN'T 
COMPETE.
SO, CANADA HAS A LONG WAY TO GO.
I MUST BE HONEST, WE'RE NOT 
GETTING ALONG WITH THEIR 
NEGOTIATORS.
WE THINK THEY HAVE TAKEN 
ADVANTAGE OF OUR COUNTRY FOR A 
LONG TIME.
WE HAD PEOPLE THAT DIDN'T KNOW 
WHAT THEY WERE DOING.
THAT'S WHY WE HAD OVER THE LAST 
FIVE OR SIX YEARS, IF YOU 
AVERAGE IT OUT, WE HAD $800 
BILLION A YEAR IN TRADE LOSSES.
IT'S RIDICULOUS.
IT'S NOT GOING TO HAPPEN.
>> MR. PRESIDENT, NAFTA, WHAT 
DOES THAT MEAN FOR NAFTA?
WILL YOU BE PULLING OUT OF 
NAFTA?
>> I DON'T LIKE NAFTA.
I NEVER LIKED IT.
IT'S BEEN VERY BAD FOR THE 
UNITED STATES.
IT'S BEEN GREAT FOR CANADA, IT'S
BEEN GREAT FOR MEXICO.
>> WILL YOU PULL OUT -- 
>> I'M NOT GOING TO USE THE NAME
NAFTA.
I REFUSE TO USE IT.
I'VE SEEN THOUSANDS OF PLANTS 
AND FACTORIES CLOSE.
I'VE SEEN MILLIONS OF JOBS LOST 
TO AUTO COMPANIES THAT MOVE.
MEXICO HAS 25% OF OUR AUTO 
BUSINESS NOW BECAUSE OF NAFTA.
UNDER OUR DEAL, NOT GOING TO 
HAPPEN ANYMORE, HATE TO TELL 
YOU, IT'S NOT.
WE'RE GOING TO KEEP COMPANIES.
I TOLD THE MEXICANS, WE HAVE TO 
KEEP COMPANIES.
BUT THEY'RE GETTING A LOT ALSO, 
THEY'RE GETTING A LOT OF GOOD 
THINGS.
MEXICO MADE A VERY GOOD DEAL.
BUT WITH CANADA, IT'S VERY 
TOUGH.
WHAT WE'RE DOING IS, IF WE MADE 
A DEAL WITH CANADA, WHICH IS, 
YOU KNOW, A GOOD CHANCE STILL, 
BUT I'M NOT MAKING ANYTHING NEAR
WHAT THEY WANT TO DO.
>> ARE YOU GOING TO NOTIFY 
CONGRESS OF PULLING OUT OF 
NAFTA?
>> WE'RE PROBABLY GOING TO CALL 
IT THE USMC, LIKE, THE UNITED 
STATES MARINE CORPS, WHICH I 
LOVE, GENERAL KELLY LIKES IT 
EVEN MORE.
WHERE IS GENERAL KELLY, HE LIKES
THAT, USMC, WHICH WOULD BE U.S.,
MEXICO, CANADA, BUT IT WILL 
PROBABLY BE, POSSIBLY BE JUST 
USM, IT WILL BE UNITED STATES 
AND MEXICO.
CANADA WILL COME ALONG.
IF CANADA DOESN'T MAKE A DEAL 
WITH US, WE'RE GOING TO MAKE A 
MUCH BETTER DEAL.
WE'RE GOING TO TAX THE CARS THAT
COME IN, WE WILL PUT BILLIONS 
AND BILLIONS OF DOLLARS INTO OUR
TREASURY AND, FRANKLY, WE'LL BE 
VERY HAPPY, BECAUSE IT'S 
ACTUALLY MORE MONEY THAN YOU CAN
MAKE UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCE WITH
MAKING A DEAL.
GOOD JOB, TOO.
YOU DO A VERY GOOD JOB.
REALLY.
YES, PLEASE.
GO AHEAD.
>> THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR 
TIME, MR. PRESIDENT.
TWO QUICKLY QUESTIONS.
WHAT WILL BE THE USA RELATIONS 
WITH THE KURDS?
>> OH, I THOUGHT I JUST ANSWERED
THAT.
>> POST-ISIS.
>> OKAY, WE'RE TRYING TO GET 
ALONG VERY WELL.
WE DO GET ALONG GREAT WITH THE 
KURDS.
WE'RE TRYING TO HELP THEM A LOT.
DON'T FORGET, THAT'S THEIR 
TERRITORY.
I WANT TO HELP THEM.
GO AHEAD, WHAT'S NEXT.
THEY FOUGHT WITH US.
THEY DIED WITH US.
WE LOST TENS OF THOUSANDS OF 
KURDS DIED FIGHTING ISIS.
THEY DIED FOR US AND WITH US AND
FOR THEMSELVES.
THEY DIED FOR THEMSELVES.
BUT THEY'RE GREAT PEOPLE.
AND WE HAVE NOT -- WE DON'T 
FORGET.
I DON'T FORGET WHAT HAPPENS SOME
DAY LATER, BUT I CAN TELL YOU 
THAT I DON'T FORGET.
THESE ARE GREAT PEOPLE.
OKAY.
YES, MA'AM, PLEASE.
>> ABOUT IRAN, MR. PRESIDENT, 
ABOUT IRAN WHAT IS YOUR CLEAR 
PLAN TO STOP IRANIAN INFLUENCE 
IN IRAQ, IN SYRIA AND 
ESPECIALLY -- 
>> WELL, I THINK YOU'VE SEEN, I 
MUST TELL YOU, I DON'T MIND YOUR
QUESTION.
>> THANK YOU.
>> I THINK THERE'S BEEN NO 
GREATER CHANGE, OTHER THAN MAYBE
CHINA, BECAUSE CHINA, 
UNFORTUNATELY, THEIR MARKETS 
HAVE DROPPED, WOULD YOU SAY, 30%
IN THE LAST FOUR MONTHS, RIGHT?
I THINK I WATCHED YOU RECENTLY 
WHEN YOU SAID THAT.
A LOT.
THERE'S BEEN NO, OTHER THAN 
MAYBE THAT, BUT EVEN THAT, 
BECAUSE CHINA IS A VERY SPECIAL 
PLACE.
AND IRAN IS A VERY SPECIAL 
PLACE.
BUT I THINK THERE'S BEEN NO 
COUNTRY THAT'S CHANGED SO MUCH 
AS IRAN.
IN THE LAST SIX MONTHS SINCE I 
TOOK OFF THE HORRIBLE, HORRIBLE 
IRAN NUCLEAR DEAL, AS THEY 
CALLED IT, ONE OF THE DUMBEST 
DEALS EVER MADE, AS AN EXAMPLE, 
WHY DIDN'T THEY TAKE CARE OF 
YEMEN IN THE DEAL, WHY DIDN'T 
THEY TAKE CARE OF SYRIA IN THE 
DEAL?
YOU KNOW WHAT THE REASON WAS?
IT WAS TOO COMPLICATED.
WE'RE GIVING $150 BILLION.
WE PAID $1.8 BILLION IN CASH, IN
CASH, THE ROOM WOULD BE FILLED 
UP WITH $100 BUL BILLS.
WE GAVE $1.8 BILLION IN CASH.
WHY DIDN'T WE TAKE CARE OF 
YEMEN?
WHY DIDN'T WE TAKE CARE OF SYRIA
AND OTHER -- AND HE SAID, 
BECAUSE IT WAS TOO COMPLICATED.
WELL, YOU JUST GAVE THEM ALL 
YOUR CARDS.
YOU GAVE THEM $150 BILLION.
AND NOW YEMEN IS A MESS, BUT 
IT'S GETTING BETTER.
AND SYRIA'S A MESS.
AND I WAS RESPONSIBLE, AND I 
HOPE IT STAYS THAT WAY, WHEN I 
PUT OUT ON SOCIAL MEDIA A FEW 
WEEKS AGO ABOUT IDLIB PROVINCE.
I SAID, DON'T DO IT.
I'LL TELL YOU, IT HAPPENED WHERE
I WAS AT A MEETING WITH A LOT OF
SUPPORTERS AND A WOMAN STOOD UP 
AND SHE SAID, THERE'S A PROVINCE
IN SYRIA WITH 3 MILLION PEOPLE.
RIGHT NOW, THE IRANIANS, THE 
RUSSIANS AND THE SYRIANS 
SURROUNDING THEIR PROVINCE, AND 
THEY'RE GOING TO KILL MY SISTER 
AND THEY'RE GOING TO KILL 
MILLIONS OF PEOPLE IN ORDER TO 
GET RID OF 25,000 OR 35,000 
TERRORISTS OR ENEMIES OF THEIRS,
BUT I THINK WE CAN CALL THEM 
TERRORISTS.
AND I SAID, THAT'S NOT GOING TO 
HAPPEN.
I DIDN'T HEAR OF IDLIB PROVINCE.
AND I CAME BACK TO NEW YORK AND 
I PICKED UP THE FAILING "NEW 
YORK TIMES," I HATE TO ADMIT IT 
WAS "THE NEW YORK TIMES," BUT IT
WAS THE FAILING "NEW YORK 
TIMES."
THERE WAS A STORY, AND THERE WAS
THE SAME STORY.
WHY WOULD ANYONE DO THAT WITH 3 
MILLION PEOPLE?
AND IT SAID THEY WERE BEING 
SURROUNDED AND THINK WERE GOING 
IN STARTING LITERALLY THE NEXT 
DAY THEY WERE GOING TO DROP 
BOMBS ALL OVER THE PLACE AND 
PERHAPS KILL MILLIONS OF PEOPLE 
IN ORDER TO GET 35,000 
TERRORISTS.
AND I PUT OUT ON SOCIAL MEDIA 
AND ELSEWHERE, I GAVE MIKE 
POMPEO, JOHN BOLTON, EVERYBODY 
THESE ORDERS, DON'T LET IT 
HAPPEN.
I SAID, DON'T LET IT HAPPEN.
THAT DOESN'T MEAN THEY CAN'T BE 
SELECTIVE, THEY CAN'T BE, YOU 
KNOW, GO IN AND -- THEY'VE GOT 
TO DO WHAT THEY'VE GOT TO DO 
WITH TERRORISTS, ASSUME THEY'RE 
TERRORISTS, BUT DON'T KILL 
MILLIONS OF PEOPLE.
AND IT STOPPED.
YOU SAW THAT.
NOBODY'S GOING TO GIVE ME 
CREDIT, BUT THAT'S OKAY.
THAT'S OKAY.
BECAUSE THE PEOPLE KNOW.
I HAVE HAD MORE SYRIANS THANK ME
FOR THAT -- THIS WAS ABOUT FOUR 
WEEKS AGO, I PUT THAT OUT.
I SAID, THEY'RE SURROUNDING A 
CITY OF 3 MILLION PEOPLE, 
THEY'RE GOING TO START BOMBING 
THE CITY, DON'T LET IT HAPPEN.
AND I MEANT IT, TOO, I MEANT IT.
AND MILLIONS OF PEOPLE HAVE BEEN
SAVED, AND I GAVE TODAY GREAT 
CREDIT TO IRAN, I DON'T KNOW IF 
YOU HEARD THAT, I GAVE GREAT 
CREDIT TO IRAN, TO RUSSIA AND TO
SYRIA FOR NOT DOING IT.
NOW, I HOPE IT'S GOING TO BE 
SURGICAL, MEANING GO IN AND DO, 
IT'S LENGTHY AND EVERYTHING 
ELSE.
AND THEY POSSIBLY HAVE TO DO IT.
BUT I THINK MILLIONS OF PEOPLE 
WOULD HAVE BEEN KILLED.
AND THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN A 
SHAME.
AND HOPEFULLY -- AND I HAVE TO 
TELL YOU, TURKEY HAS BEEN A BIG 
HELP.
TURKEY HAS BEEN GREAT.
TURKEY HAS HELPED US VERY MUCH 
WITH THAT WHOLE SITUATION.
YES, YES.
>> THANK YOU, MR. PRESIDENT.
>> THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
>> TOUCHING BACK ON IRAN, OF 
COURSE, THIS WEEK, YOU PUT OUT A
CALL TO ACTION TO OTHER 
COUNTRIES TO RALLY WITH AMERICA 
TO PUT PRESSURE ON IRAN.
ROUHANI STILL CALLING FOR THE 
U.S. TO COME BACK INTO THE OLD 
DEAL.
BUT AFTER MEETING WITH WORLD 
LEADERS THIS WEEK, DID YOU MAKE 
ANY PROGRESS TOWARDS A POTENTIAL
NEW DEAL?
>> DOESN'T MATTER WHAT WORLD 
LEADERS THINK ON IRAN.
IRAN'S GOING TO COME BACK TO ME 
AND THEY'RE GOING TO MAKE A GOOD
DEAL.
I THINK.
MAYBE NOT.
DEALS, YOU NEVER KNOW.
BUT THEY'RE SUFFERING GREATLY.
THEY'RE HAVING RIOTS IN EVERY 
CITY.
FAR GREATER THAN THEY WERE 
DURING THE GREEN PERIOD WITH 
PRESIDENT OBAMA.
FAR GREATER, WHEN PRESIDENT 
OBAMA STUCK UP FOR GOVERNMENT, 
NOT THE PEOPLE.
HE PROBABLY WOULD HAVE HAD A 
MUCH DIFFERENT IRAN HAD HE NOT 
DOPE THAT.
BUT I'M STICKING WITH THE 
PEOPLE.
I AM WITH THE PEOPLE OF IRAN.
BUT HERE'S THE THING.
THEY HAVE RAMPANT INFLATION.
THEIR MONEY IS WORTHLESS.
EVERYTHING IS GOING WRONG.
YOU CAN'T BUY BREAD.
YOU CAN'T DO ANYTHING.
IT'S A DISASTER.
AT SOME POINT, I THINK THEY'RE 
GOING TO WANT TO COME BACK AND 
THEY'RE GOING TO SAY, HEY, CAN 
WE DO SOMETHING?
AND VERY SIMPLE, I JUST DON'T 
WANT THEM TO HAVE NUCLEAR 
WEAPONS, THAT'S ALL.
IS THAT TOO MUCH TO ASK?
I DON'T WANT THEM TO HAVE 
NUCLEAR WEAPONS.
I WANT THEM TO HAVE A GREAT 
ECONOMY.
I WANT THEM TO SELL SO MUCH OIL 
SO THAT THE OIL PRICES -- I'M 
NOT HAPPY WITH OPEC.
I TOLD THEM, I'M NOT HAPPY WITH 
OPEC.
WE TAKE CARE OF ALL THESE 
PEOPLE, WE DEFEND THEM, THEY 
WOULDN'T THERE FOR TWO WEEKS IF 
IT WASN'T FOR ME AND THE UNITED 
STATES AND OUR MUCH STRONGER 
ARMED FORCES THAN IT WAS, 
BECAUSE OUR ARMED FORCES WAS 
DEPLETED, WE HAD OLD EQUIPMENT.
YOU KNOW BETTER THAN ANYBODY, 
716 BILLION, WE HAVE THE MOST 
INCREDIBLE NEW JETS AND 
EVERYTHING.
WE NEED IT.
NOT THAT I WANT TO SPEND IT, 
THOUGH IT IS JOBS, IT'S ALL MADE
IN THE UNITED STATES.
BUT IRAN HAS TO COME BACK AND 
THEY HAVE TO TALK.
AND I'M NOT DOING THIS FROM 
STRENGTH OR WEAKNESS.
I'M JUST SAYING AT SOME POINT 
THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE TO COME 
BACK.
IF YOU LOOK AT WHAT'S GOING ON, 
COMPANIES ARE LEAVING LEFT AND 
RIGHT.
MERCEDES B-BENZ JUST LEFT.
THEY'RE ALL LEAVES.
THEY DON'T WANT TO BE IN IRAN.
THEY HAVE A CHOICE.
DO THEY WANT TO BE WITH IRAN OR 
DO THEY WANT TO BE WITH US?
AND WE PICKED UP $10 TRILLION 
SINCE MY ELECTION.
WE WERE BEING CAUGHT BY CHINA, 
NOW IT'S GOING THE OTHER WAY.
PEOPLE CAN'T BELIEVE IT.
PEOPLE HAVE NEVER SEEN THIS 
SITUATION WITH CHINA.
EVERYTHING'S ALWAYS BEEN FOR 20 
YEARS, OH, CHINA'S SO GREAT, 
CHINA'S SO GREAT.
YOU DON'T HEAR THAT SO MUCH 
ANYMORE.
I LOVE CHINA.
I THINK THEY'RE GREAT.
BUT YOU DON'T HEAR THAT SO MUCH 
ANYMORE.
YOU KNOW WHO IS GREAT NOW?
WE'RE GREAT NOW.
OKAY, HOW ABOUT JUST A COUPLE 
MORE?
I COULD BE -- I COULD BE DOING 
THIS ALL DAY LONG.
I COULD BE DOING THIS ALL DAY 
LONG.
SHOULD WE CONTINUE FOR A LITTLE 
WHILE, IT DOESN'T MATTER TO ME?
COUPLE MORE?
I DON'T CARE.
"NEW YORK TIMES."
COME ON.
STAND UP.
GO AHEAD.
NO, I'M TALKING ABOUT "THE 
TIMES" IS FAILING.
YOU ARE FAR FROM FAILING.
>> YOU WERE POINTING TO ME, SO 
YOU MEANT ME.
>> "THE TIMES," VERY 
INTERESTING, I THINK THEY'RE 
GOING TO ENDORSE ME.
I THINK THAT ABC, WELL, FOX, I 
LIKE FOX, I REALLY DO.
I THINK ABC, CBS, NBC, THE 
TIMES, THEY'RE ALL GOING TO 
ENDORSE ME, BECAUSE IF THEY 
DON'T, THEY'RE GOING OUT OF 
BUSINESS.
CAN YOU IMAGINE IF YOU DIDN'T 
HAVE ME?
GO AHEAD WHAT WOULD YOU LIKE TO 
SAY?
>> I KNOW YOU WERE POINTING TO 
ME, BUT I POINT FOR PBS NEWS 
OUTLET.
>> I KNOW THAT.
>> I WANT TO ASK YOU, YESTERDAY,
YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT YOUR 
ADMINISTRATION'S ACCOMPLISHMENTS
AT THE UNITED NATIONS AND A LOT 
OF THE LEADERS LAUGHED.
WHY DO YOU THINK -- 
>> WELL, THAT'S FAKE NEWS.
>> WHAT WAS THAT EXPERIENCE 
LIKE?
>> IT WAS FAKE NEWS AND IT WAS 
COVERED THAT WAY.
SO, I SAID THAT SINCE MY 
ELECTION, OUR ECONOMY HAS BECOME
THE HOTTEST IN THE WORLD.
TAX REDUCTIONS, REGULATIONS, 
CONFIDENCE LEVELS ARE THE 
HIGHEST IN 18 YEARS, REALLY SOON
TO BE HISTORIC.
UNEMPLOYMENT IS THE LOWEST IN 
THE HISTORY OF OUR COUNTRY, YOU 
LOOK AT BLACK UNEMPLOYMENT, YOU 
LOOK AT ASIAN UNEMPLOYMENT, YOU 
LOOK AT WOMEN 65 YEARS.
THE UNEMPLOYMENT NUMBERS ARE 
AMONG THE BEST WE'VE EVER HAD 
EVER.
THE NUMBERS OF NEW COMPANIES 
POURING INTO OUR COUNTRY, WHICH 
NOBODY THOUGHT WAS POSSIBLE.
AND I SAID THIS AND I WAS IN 
FRONT OF A LARGE GROUP OF HIGHLY
PROFESSIONAL PEOPLE, MOST OF 
WHOM ARE FROM EITHER OTHER 
COUNTRIES OR THE UNITED NATIONS,
PEOPLE THAT AREN'T BIG INTO 
CLAPPING, APPLAUDING, SMILING.
AND I HEARD A LITTLE RUSTLE, AS 
I SAID, OUR COUNTRY IS NOW 
STRONGER THAN EVER BEFORE.
IT'S TRUE.
I HEARD A LITTLE RUSTLE, I SAID,
IT'S TRUE.
I DIDN'T KNOW THERE WOULD BE 
THAT KIND -- THEY WEREN'T 
LAUGHING AT ME.
THEY WERE LAUGHING WITH ME.
WE HAD FUN.
THAT WAS NOT LAUGHING AT ME.
SO, THE FAKE NEWS SAID, PEOPLE 
LAUGHED AT PRESIDENT TRUMP.
THEY DIDN'T LAUGH AT ME.
PEOPLE HAD A GOOD TIME WITH ME.
WE WERE DOING IT TOGETHER.
WE HAD A GOOD TIME.
THEY RESPECT WHAT I'VE DONE.
THE UNITED STATES IS RESPECTED 
AGAIN.
UNITED STATES WAS NOT RESPECTED.
EVERYBODY WAS TAKING ADVANTAGE 
OF US, FROM JOBS AND TAKING OUR 
COMPANIES AND NOT PAYING THE 
PRICE, TO SO MANY OTHER THINGS, 
EVEN MILITARY PROTECTION.
I TOLD A NUMBER OF COUNTRIES 
OVER THE LAST FEW DAYS, I SAID, 
LISTEN.
YOU'RE A VERY RICH COUNTRY.
WE PROTECT YOU.
WITHOUT OUR PROTECTION, YOU 
WOULD HAVE REAL PROBLEMS.
>> I WANT TO -- 
>> I SAID, YOU SHOULD REIMBURSE 
US FOR THIS PROTECTION.
WHY ARE WE PROTECTING YOU?
AND YOU WANT TO KNOW WHAT THEY 
SAID?
AFTER ABOUT TWO MINUTES OF 
TALKING, THEY AGREED WITH ME.
AND YOU CAN ASK THIS GROUP OF 
VERY TALENTED PEOPLE.
THEY AGREED WITH ME.
BUT THEY SAID, ONE OF THEM SAID,
BUT MR. PRESIDENT, NOBODY EVER 
ASKED US, THEY NEVER ASKED US 
FOR THAT.
NOBODY'S EVER SAID, YOU SHOULD 
PAY.
THESE ARE REALLY WEALTHY 
COUNTRIES.
I MEAN, I'LL BE HONEST, I JUST 
ASKED JAPAN, I SAID, WE'RE 
DEFENDING YOU, YOU'RE A VERY 
WEALTHY COUNTRY.
YOU'RE SENDING US MILLIONS OF 
CARS, WE HAVE A TREMENDOUS TRADE
DEFICIT WITH YOU.
AND WE'RE DEFENDING YOU AND 
WE'RE SUBSIDIZING YOUR MILITARY 
WITH A MASSIVE AMOUNT OF MONEY.
I SAID IT TO SOUTH KOREA.
WE HAVE 32,000 SOLDIERS IN SOUTH
KOREA.
THEY'RE VERY WEALTHY.
THESE ARE GREAT COUNTRIES.
THESE ARE VERY WEALTHY 
COUNTRIES.
I SAID, WHY AREN'T YOU 
REIMBURSING US FOR OUR COSTS?
AND YOU THOUGH WHAT, THEY LOOK 
AT ME AND THEY CAN'T ANSWER, 
BECAUSE THERE'S NO ANSWER.
IF THEY'RE A POOR COUNTRY AND 
THEY NEEDED PROTECTION AND 
PEOPLE WERE GOING TO DIE, I'M 
ALL FOR PROTECTING THEM, I DON'T
WANT 10 CENTS.
BUT WHEN WEALTHY COUNTRIES THAT 
HAVE MASSIVE TRADE SURPLUSES 
WITH US, MASSIVE, AND THEN ON 
TOP OF THAT, WE'RE PAYING FOR 
THEIR MILITARY OR WE'RE PAYING 
FOR A LOT OF THEIR MILITARY, 
THAT DOESN'T WORK.
HOW ABOUT TWO MORE AND -- 
>> MR. PRESIDENT, REALLY 
QUICKLY, MR. PRESIDENT, YOU SAID
YOU FEEL A KINSHIP, YOU SAID YOU
FEEL A KINSHIP WITH BRETT 
KAVANAUGH AND -- MR. PRESIDENT, 
REALLY QUICKLY, YOU SAID YOU 
FELT A KINSHIP WITH BRETT 
KAVANAUGH, YOUR FALSE 
ALLEGATIONS THAT YOU FEEL LIKE 
WERE MADE AGAINST YOU MAKE YOU 
FEEL LIKE YOU DON'T WANT TO 
BELIEVE THIS WOMEN.
WHAT -- 
>> I DIDN'T SAY THAT.
FAKE NEWS.
>> PLEASE EXPLAIN THEN WHAT YOU 
WERE TALKING ABOUT.
>> BY THE WAY, YOU THINK YOU DO 
A VERY GOOD JOB.
BUT I DIDN'T SAY THAT.
I DO WATCH YOU AND YOU THINK YOU
DO A VERY GOOD JOB.
>> COULD YOU EXPLAIN WHAT YOU 
MEANT?
>> EXACTLY.
I LOOK FORWARD TO WATCHING HER.
I DO WANT TO HEAR WHAT SHE SAYS.
AND MAYBE SHE'LL SAY, I COULD BE
CONVINCED OF ANYTHING.
MAYBE SHE'LL SAY SOMETHING.
BUT IN THE MEANTIME, I HAVE TO 
TELL YOU, HE'S ONE OF THE 
HIGHEST QUALITY MAN BEINGS.
HE'S A TREMENDOUS MAN.
HE'S A GREAT INTELLECT.
HE WAS NUMBER ONE AT YALE -- 
>> SO YOU DON'T FEEL A KINSHIP 
WITH HIM?
>> HE WAS A GREAT STUDENT IN 
LAW.
HE WAS, YOU KNOW, I'VE HEARD HIS
NAME, I DIDN'T KNOW HIM, DIDN'T 
KNOW HIM, UNTIL THIS WHOLE 
THING.
I DIDN'T KNOW HIM.
BUT I HEARD HIS NAME FOR TEN 
YEARS.
AND YOU KNOW HOW I HEARD HIS 
NAME?
EVERYBODY WAS SAYING, HE SHOULD 
BE ON THE SUPREME COURT.
I SAID, WHO IS HE?
HIS NAME IS BRETT KAVANAUGH.
AND HE SHOULD BE, HE'S THE MOST 
BRILLIANT PERSON, HE'S THE MOST 
BRILLIANT LAWYER -- THEY WERE 
TALKING ABOUT HIM ON THE SUPREME
COURT TEN YEARS AGO.
WITH ALL OF THAT, I WANT TO HEAR
WHAT SHE HAS TO SAID.
>> YOU SAID THAT YOU FEEL LIKE 
THERE HAVE BEEN NUMEROUS FALSE 
ALLEGATIONS AGAINST YOU AND THAT
BECAUSE -- 
>> I'VE HAD MANY FALSE -- 
>> YOU UNDERSTAND WHAT HE'S 
GOING THROUGH.
>> I'VE HAD MANY FALSE 
STATEMENTS AGAINST ME AND IF THE
PRESS WOULD HAVE REPORTED, I 
WOULD HAVE BEEN VERY HAPPY.
JOHN ROBERTS WOULD TELL YOU, YOU
COVERED THE STORY WHERE THE 
WOMEN WERE PAID TO SAY BAD 
THINGS ABOUT ME.
SEAN HANNITY COVERED IT.
I WILL TELL YOU, WHEN -- I SAW 
THAT ON SEAN HANNITY, I ACTUALLY
CALLED HIM.
BELIEVE IT OR NOT.
I DON'T SPEAK TO HIM VERY MUCH.
BUT I RESPECT HIM.
I CALLED HIM.
I SAID, THIS IS THE BIGGEST 
STORY, THIS IS A BIG, BIG STORY.
HE AGREED WITH ME.
THE NEXT DAY, I PICKED UP THE 
PAPERS, THERE WASN'T ONE WORD 
ABOUT IT.
I WATCHED ABC NEWS, JON, I 
WATCHED NBC, I WATCHED CBS, I 
DIDN'T WATCH CNN, BUT NEXT TIME 
I WILL.
>> ARE YOU OKAY WITH -- 
>> I WATCHED EVERYTHING.
THERE WASN'T ONE STORY OTHER 
THAN FOX.
AND IT'S A BIG STORY.
IT'S A SHAME.
OKAY, THANK YOU.
THANK YOU.
>> IS IT OKAY IF I GIVE IT TO 
"THE NEW YORK TIMES" MR. 
PRESIDENT?
>> THAT'S ENOUGH.
GOOD JOB.
>> MR. PRESIDENT, COULD I ASK A 
QUESTION SINCE I AM FROM "THE 
NEW YORK TIMES" BEFORE THIS 
GENTLEMAN?
>> SINCE YOU'RE WHERE?
>> I'M ACTUALLY FROM "THE NEW 
YORK TIMES."
SHE IS MY FORMER COLLEAGUE, WE 
MISS HER.
BUT I WAS -- 
>> I DON'T BLAME YOU.
I'LL LET YOU DO IT AFTER HE 
DOES.
IS THAT OKAY?
>> THAT'S PERFECTLY WELL.
>> IN HONOR OF A PAPER I ONCE 
LOVED.
THANK YOU.
GO AHEAD.
>> MR. PRESIDENT, I'M WITH TRU 
NEWS.
TODAY, YOU MET WITH BIBI 
NETANYAHU AND YOU BROUGHT UP 
THAT YOU SUPPORTED A TWO-STATE 
SOLUTION FOR THE 
PALESTINIAN/ISRAELI CRISIS 
THERE.
>> I DO.
>> CAN YOU GIVE US ANYMORE 
PREVIEW, WHAT THIS GREAT DEAL --
>> I WOULD LOVE TO MAKE A DEAL 
WITH THE ISRAELIS AND THE 
PALESTINIANS.
MY WHOLE LIFE, I WAS TOLD, 
THAT'S THE TOUGHEST DEAL.
I DISAGREE, I THINK HEALTH CARE 
IS PROBABLY TOUGHER, THAT'S THE 
TRUTH.
BUT IT IS TOUGH.
WE'RE GOING TO TAKE CARE OF 
THAT, TOO.
THAT'S GOING TO BE TAKEN CARE 
OF.
WE'VE TAKEN CARE OF A LOT OF IT.
ALL MY LIFE, I'VE HEARD THE DEAL
BETWEEN THE PALESTINIANS AND THE
ISRAELIS IS THE TOUGHEST DEAL.
EVERYTHING TOUGH ABOUT THAT.
I THINK WE'RE GOING TO MAKE A 
DEAL.
I THINK WE'RE GOING TO MAKE A 
DEAL.
SO, AT ONE OF OUR MANY MEETINGS 
TODAY, I WAS WITH BIBI 
NETANYAHU, A MAN WHO I HAVE A 
LOT OF RESPECT FOR.
MAN THAT'S BEEN VERY NICE TO ME,
HAPPY THAT I DID THE WHOLE THING
WITH JERUSALEM.
WE'RE GOING TO OPEN IN FOUR 
MONTHS FOR LESS THAN $500,000.
AND THE BUDGET WAS OVER A 
BILLION DOLLARS, RIGHT?
>> YES.
>> SO, WE SAVED A BILLION 
DOLLARS.
THAT'S NOT SO BAD.
AND IT'S OPEN.
AND IT'S BEAUTIFUL.
JERUSALEM STONE.
SOME OF MY FAVORITE STUFF.
I WILL TELL YOU, THE QUESTION, 
SOMEBODY SAID TODAY, WELL, THIS 
IS FIRST NEWS CONFERENCE IN A 
LONG TIME, I SAID, WHAT DO YOU 
MEAN?
I DID FIVE TODAY.
EVERY TIME I SIT, I TAKE A LOT 
OF QUESTIONS FROM PEOPLE THAT 
ARE SCREAMING LIKE MANIACS IN 
THE BACK OF THE ROOM, MEANING 
REPORTERS, AND ONE OF THE 
REPORTERS, I WON'T SAY THAT IT 
WAS JOHN ROBERTS THAT SAID THAT,
BUT ONE OF THE -- IT WAS, BUT 
THAT'S OKAY.
DON'T FEEL GUILTY, JOHN.
BUT ONE OF THE REPORTERS THAT 
WAS SCREAMING ASKED ABOUT THE 
ONE STATE/TWO STATE.
AND I SAID, I THINK THE 
TWO-STATE WILL HAPPEN, I THINK 
IT'S IN ONE WAY MORE DIFFICULT, 
BECAUSE IT'S A REAL ESTATE DEAL,
BECAUSE YOU NEED MEETS AND 
BOUNDS AND YOU NEED LOTS OF 
CARVEOUTS.
IT'S ACTUALLY A LITTLE TOUGHER 
DEAL.
BUT ANOTHER WAY IT WORKS BETTER,
BECAUSE YOU HAVE PEOPLE 
GOVERNING THEMSELVES AND, SO, 
THEY ASKED ME ABOUT THAT, I 
SAID, WELL, I THINK THE 
TWO-STATE WILL HAPPEN, I THINK 
WE'RE GOING TO GO DOWN THE 
TWO-STATE ROAD.
AND I'M GLAD I GOT IT OUT.
AND JARED, WHO IS SO INVOLVED, 
HE LOVES ISRAEL, HE LOVES 
ISRAEL.
BUT HE'S ALSO GOING TO BE VERY 
FAIR WITH THE PALESTINIANS.
HE UNDERSTANDS IT TAKES TWO 
PEOPLE TO BE HAPPY.
TWO GROUPS OF PEOPLE TO BE 
HAPPY.
EVERYBODY'S GOT TO BE HAPPY.
AND THAT'S WHY IT'S SO TOUGH, 
BECAUSE THERE'S BEEN SO MUCH 
HATRED AND ANGER FOR SO MANY 
YEARS, THAT'S WHAT PROBABLY THE 
NUMBER ONE INGREDIENT OF 
TOUGHNESS IS, BUT THEY ASKED ME,
I SAID, I THINK IT'S GOING TO BE
A TWO-STATE.
AND YOU THOUGH WHAT I DID TODAY?
BY SAYING THAT, I PUT IT OUT 
THERE.
AND IF YOU ASK MOST OF THE 
PEOPLE IN ISRAEL, THEY AGREE 
WITH THAT.
BUT NOBODY WANTED TO SAY IT.
IT'S A BIG THING TO PUT IT OUT.
IT'S A VERY BIG THING TO PUT IT 
OUT.
NOW, BOTTOM LINE, IF THE 
ISRAELIS AND THE PALESTINIANS 
WANT ONE STATE, THAT'S OKAY WITH
ME, IF THEY WANT TWO STATES, 
THAT'S OKAY WITH ME.
I'M HAPPY IF THEY'RE HAPPY.
I'M A FACILITATOR, I WANT TO SEE
IF I CAN GET A DEAL DONE SO THAT
PEOPLE DON'T GET KILLED ANYMORE.
WHEN WE HAD, IN SAUDI ARABIA, WE
HAD ONE OF THE GREAT CONFERENCES
IN HISTORY, MANY OF YOU WERE 
THERE, PROBABLY ALL OF YOU WERE 
THERE.
ONE OF THE MOST BEAUTIFUL TWO 
DAYS.
THAT AND CHINA.
TWO OF THE MOST INCREDIBLE 
EVENTS I'VE EVER SEEN, SAW -- 
I'VE NEVER SEEN ANYTHING LIKE 
IT.
AND WE HAD, I BELIEVE, 58 MUSLIM
COUNTRIES, THE LEADERS, THE 
KINGS, THE ABSOLUTE LEADERS, 
THERE WAS PHONE IN SECOND PLACE.
THEY WERE THE LEADERS OF ALL.
UNBEKNOWNST TO EVERYBODY ELSE, 
IT WASN'T A SETUP, THEY'D COME 
UP TO ME AND SAID, SIR, YOU 
CAN'T HAVE PEACE IN THE MIDDLE 
EAST WITHOUT PEACE BETWEEN THE 
ISRAELIS AND THE MRUNPALESTINIA.
I SAID, WHY DOES THAT MATTER SO 
MUCH?
THEY SAID, IT JUST IS IMPOSSIBLE
TO MAKE PEACE IN THE MIDDLE EAST
UNLESS YOU HAVE IT BETWEEN THE 
ISRAELIS.
SO, I HEARD THAT FROM ONE, THE 
KING OF SAUDI ARABIA, WHO IS A 
GREAT GUY.
AND THEN SOMEBODY ELSE CAME UP 
AND HE WASN'T TOLD, OH, GO UP 
AND SAY IT.
I KNOW WHERE THEY'RE COMING 
FROM.
AND I MUST HAVE HAD 12 LEADERS 
SAY IT AND THEY JUST SAID IT.
AND I STARTED TO REALIZE THAT 
PEACE BETWEEN ISRAEL AND THE 
PALESTINIANSES FOR THE MIDDLE 
EAST IS A VERY IMPORTANT THING.
AND WE'RE TRYING VERY HARD TO 
GET IT.
I THINK PROBABLY TWO-STATE IS 
MORE LIKELY, BUT YOU KNOW WHAT?
IF THEY DO A SINGLE, IF THEY DO 
A DOUBLE, I'M OKAY WITH IT IF 
THEY'RE BOTH HAPPY.
IF THEY'RE BOTH HAPPY, I'M OKAY 
WITH EITHER.
I THINK THE TWO-STATE IS MORE 
LIKELY.
OKAY, HOW ABOUT -- 
>> "NEW YORK TIMES"?
>> AH -- 
>> OKAY.
>> I WOULD HAVE GOTTEN A BAD 
STORY "ININ "THE NEW YORK TIMS".
>> WE'RE KIND OF THRIVING THESE 
DAYS.
>> SAY THANK YOU, MR. TRUMP.
>> I THINK I'LL STOP SHORT OF 
THAT.
>> ALL MY LIFE, I'VE HAD SOME ON
THE FRONT PAGE OF "THE NEW YORK 
TIMES" AND NOW I THINK I AVERAGE
THREE, FOUR A DAY, RIGHT?
AND OF THE THREE OF FOUR, 
THEY'RE ALL NEGATIVE, NO MATTER 
WHAT I DO, THEY'RE NEGATIVE.
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT, THAT'S OKAY.
I STILL LOVE THE PAPER.
>> I WANTED TO COME BACK TO 
CHINA, BECAUSE I THINK WHAT YOU 
ANNOUNCED TODAY WAS REALLY 
IMPORTANT.
>> I AGREE.
>> YOU TALK ABOUT THIS 
FRIENDSHIP YOU HAVE WITH XI 
JINPING, AND YET, ESSENTIALLY, 
WHAT YOU DID TODAY IS ACCUSED 
HIS GOVERNMENT OF INTERFERING IN
OUR INTERNAL AFFAIRS -- 
>> THAT'S RIGHT.
>> SUBVERTING OUR DEMOCRATIC 
PROCESS AND DOING IT TO HURT 
YOU, THE REPUBLICAN PARTY -- 
>> DOING IT TO HELP THEM.
>> AND YOUR BACKERS.
>> DOING IT TO HELP THEM.
>> SO, HOW CAN A GUY THAT DOES 
THAT BE YOUR FRIEND?
>> WELL, I THINK THAT WE ARE 
ABLE TO -- AND MAYBE HE'S NOT 
ANYMORE.
I'LL BE HONEST WITH YOU, I THINK
WE HAD A VERY GOOD FRIENDSHIP.
I THINK WE HAD A VERY GOOD 
RELATIONSHIP.
WE UNDERSTAND EACH OTHER.
THEY ARE DOING STUDIES ON DONALD
TRUMP, THEY'RE TRYING TO FIGURE 
IT ALL OUT, BECAUSE THIS HAS 
NEVER HAPPENED BEFORE.
THINK OF IT.
YOU'VE COVERED VERY WELL, YOU'VE
NEVER SEEN THIS HAPPEN.
THEY'RE HAVING BIG PROBLEMS.
I DON'T WANT THEM TO HAVE 
PROBLEMS, BUT THEY HAVE TO MAKE 
A FAIR DEAL.
JUST LIKE CANADA'S GOT TO MAKE A
FAIR DEAL.
I BELIEVE THAT HE AND I HAVE A 
VERY GOOD CHEMISTRY TOGETHER.
AND I CAN TELL YOU ABOUT THAT 
WITH LEADERS, AND THERE ARE SOME
I DON'T WANT TO HAVE A CHEMISTRY
WITH THEM, AND FOR THOSE PEOPLE,
I'LL HAVE POMPEO, NIKKI, BOLTON,
JARED, I CAN GO, OUR GENERAL, IF
THEY CAN'T DO IT, I'LL HAVE 
SARAH HUCKABEE DO IT, RIGHT?
FOR THE MOST PART, I'M VERY GOOD
WITH PRIME MINISTER ABE, VERY 
GOOD WITH PRESIDENT MOON.
BY THE WAY, WHAT PRESIDENT MOON 
SAID LAST NIGHT, I KNOW YOU 
WON'T REPORT IT, BUT HE WAS 
INTERVIEWED LAST NIGHT AND HE 
ASKED HIM ABOUT ME.
I CAN'T SAY BECAUSE YOU WOULD 
SAY I'M TOO BRAGGADOCIOUS, BUT 
WHAT HE SAID ABOUT ME LAST NIGHT
WAS AN UNBELIEVABLE THING.
COULDN'T HAVE HAPPENED WITHOUT 
PRESIDENT TRUMP AND IT NEVER 
WOULD HAPPEN WITHOUT PRESIDENT 
TRUMP.
AND NOBODY ELSE COULD DO IT.
I MEAN, YOU'LL TAKE A LOOK, BUT 
I WILL TELL YOU, CHINA IS VERY 
SPECIAL.
VERY SPECIAL.
THEY'RE INCREDIBLE PEOPLE.
IT'S AN INCREDIBLE COUNTRY.
WHAT THEY'VE DONE IS 
UNBELIEVABLE.
AND IT ALL STARTED WITH THE WTO.
THERE WAS A DEFECTIVE DEAL AND 
IT ALL STARTED.
WITHOUT THE WTO, CHINA IS NOT 
CHINA THE WAY IT IS TODAY, AND 
IT STARTED AS BY OUR PEOPLE THAT
ARE STANDING RIGHT IN THIS 
POSITION THAT ARE IN THE OVAL 
OFFICE, ANOTHER WAY OF SAYING 
IT, ALLOWED THEM TO GET AWAY 
WITH MURDER.
ALLOWED A LOT OF COUNTRIES TO 
GET AWAY WITH MURDER.
I THINK WE STILL PROBABLY HAVE A
VERY GOOD RELATIONSHIP, BUT YOU 
KNOW WHAT, IN HONOR OF YOU, I 
WILL, TOMORROW, MAKE A CALL TO 
HIM, SAY, HEY, HOW YOU DOING?
OKAY?
CAN I -- YOU DON'T MIND PAYING 
BILLIONS OF DOLLARS A MONTH.
>> I JUST HAVE TWO SMALL 
FOLLOWUPS.
ONE IS, HOW WOULD YOU COMPARE 
THE LEVEL OF INTERFERENCE YOU 
SAY TODAY FROM THE CHINESE TO 
WHAT THE RUSSIANS DID IN 2016.
>> WELL, I THINK IT'S DIFFERENT.
IF YOU LOOK AT "THE DES MOINES 
REGISTER," THEY HAVE ADS THAT 
ARE MADE TO LOOK LIKE 
EDITORIALS, SAYING ABOUT, OH, 
YOU HAVE TO STOP TRUMP, YOU HAVE
TO STOP HIM.
MY FARMERS ARE SOED GOO.
THEY ARE PATRIOTS.
YOU KNOW, ON A NETWORK THAT 
DOESN'T LIKE ME VERY MUCH, WHICH
IS MOST OF THEM, BUT A NETWORK 
THAT DIDN'T -- DOESN'T REALLY 
TREATMENT ME VERY GOOD, THEY 
INTERVIEWED FARMERS AND THEY GOT
HURT BECAUSE, YOU KNOW, ALL OF A
SUDDEN CHINA STOPS BY.
BY THE WAY, THEY'VE STARTED 
BUYING AGAIN, I DON'T KNOW IF 
YOU NOTICED.
SOYBEANS ARE GOING UP, THINGS 
ARE GOING UP, WE'VE HAD VERY 
LITTLE HURT FROM WHAT I'VE DONE,
IN FACT, THE MARKETS HAVE GONE 
UP AND THE FARMERS ARE GOING TO 
DO GREAT, BUT ULTIMATELY, BUT 
THEY HAD FARMERS.
AND THESE GUYS ARE AMAZING.
I LOVE THEM.
AND THEY VOTED FOR ME AND THEY 
LOVE ME.
AND THEY SAID, WE DON'T CARE IF 
WE GET HURT, HE'S DOING THE 
RIGHT THING.
AND, YOU KNOW, A LOT OF PEOPLE, 
IT'S A COMPLEX GAME.
A LOT OF PEOPLE DON'T KNOW 
EXACTLY WHAT IT IS, THEY DON'T 
KNOW HOW TO DEFINE TARIFF, IT IS
REALLY DIFFERENT THAN A TAX, 
THOUGH IT'S GETTING CLOSE.
BUT THEY KNOW THAT FOR THE FIRST
TIME IN MANY, MANY YEARS, THEY 
HAVE A PRESIDENT THAT'S FIGHTING
FOR THEM.
THAT'S NOT LETTING THEIR JOBS BE
TAKEN TO OTHER COUNTRIES.
THAT'S NOT ALLOWING THE KIND OF 
ABUSE THAT -- I MEAN, WHEN YOU 
LOOK AT WHAT HAPPENED AS AN 
EXAMPLE WITH NAFTA, AND FOR 
YEARS, BECAUSE IT WAS NEVER 
CHANGED, NAFTA WAS A DEFECTIVE 
DEAL THE DAY IT WAS SIGNED.
YOU KNOW WHY?
BECAUSE THEY HAD A VAT TEXT OF 
17% AND NOBODY FROM THIS COUNTRY
KNEW THAT, AND BY THE TIME THEY 
FOUND OUT, WHICH WAS ABOUT A 
WEEK LATER, NOBODY WENT AND 
CHANGED IT.
SO, YOU WENT MANY YEARS, AND 
THEY NEVER CHANGED IT.
THERE WAS A VAT TAX THAT MEXICO 
GOT.
SO, WE WERE 17 OR 16 POINTS 
BEHIND BEFORE WE EVEN STARTED.
NAFTA WAS A HORRIBLE THING.
SO, THE FARMERS AND, BY THE WAY,
THE STEELWORKERS, YOU KNOW, I 
STOPPED THE DUMPING, THE DUMPING
WAS HORRIBLE.
AND NOW IF THEY WANT TO DUMP, 
THAT'S OKAY, BUT THEY'VE GOT TO 
PAY THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA
25% ON EVERYTHING THEY DUMP.
THAT'S OKAY.
BUT AS I TOLD YOU BEFORE, STEEL 
IS DOING PHENOMENALLY WELL.
BUT THE FARMERS SAY, THIS MAN'S 
FIGHTING FOR US, NO PRESIDENT 
HAS EVER FOUGHT FOR US BEFORE.
AND YOU REALLY HAVE TO STUDY 
WHAT'S HAPPENED OVER THE 15 
YEARS.
THE FARMERS HAVE BEEN DECIMATED 
OVER A 15-YEAR PERIOD.
THEY'VE BEEN DECIMATED.
FARMERS ARE GOING TO COME OUT 
GREAT.
THEY'RE GREAT, GREAT PATRIOTS.
I THINK WE SHOULD FINISH WITH 
THAT ONE, IS THAT OKAY?
OKAY.
GO AHEAD, LET'S GO.
FAST.
>> SURE.
>> ALWAYS LIKE TO FINISH WITH A 
GOOD ONE.
ELTON JOHN SAID, WHEN YOU HIT 
THAT LAST TUNE AND IT'S GOOD, 
DON'T GO BACK.
>> WELL -- 
>> HAVE YOU EVER SEEN, THEY 
DO -- THEY HIT THE LAST TUNE, 
EVERYONE GOES CRAZY, THEY GO 
BACK FOR AN ENCORE, RIGHT?
AND THEY DON'T HIT IT.
AND THEY LEAVE, EVERYONE LEAVES,
THAT WASN'T A VERY GOOD 
CONFERENCE.
>> WELL, ONE FINAL QUESTION -- 
>> DON'T MAKE ME WRONG.
>> AHEAD OF TOMORROW'S HEARING, 
BECAUSE YOU WERE ASKED -- 
>> ABOUT THE HEARING TOMORROW.
YOU WERE ASKED EARLIER ABOUT THE
MESSAGE THAT YOU ARE SENDING TO 
THE WOMEN OF THE COUNTRY.
WHAT ABOUT THE MESSAGE THAT YOU 
MAY BE SENDING TO YOUNG MEN?
YOU'RE A FATHER.
WHAT DOES THIS MOMENT THAT WE'RE
IN, THE CULTURAL MOMENT -- 
>> IT'S A VERY BIG CULTURAL 
MOMENT.
>> RIGHT.
WHAT MESSAGE ARE YOU SENDING TO 
THE YOUNG MEN OF AMERICA?
>> YOU'RE RIGHT.
I THINK IT'S A GREAT QUESTION.
THIS IS A VERY BIG MOMENT FOR 
OUR COUNTRY.
BECAUSE YOU HAVE A MAN WHO IS 
VERY OUTSTANDING, BUT HE'S GOT 
VERY STRONG CHARGES AGAINST HIM.
PROBABLY CHARGES THAT NOBODY'S 
GOING TO BE ABLE TO PROVE.
SO, I COULD HAVE YOU CHOSEN FOR 
A POSITION, I COULD HAVE YOU OR 
YOU, ANYBODY, AND SOMEBODY COULD
SAY -- AND IT'S HAPPENED TO ME.
MANY TIMES.
WHERE FALSE STATEMENTS ARE MADE.
AND HONESTLY, NOBODY KNOWS WHO 
TO BELIEVE.
I COULD PICK ANOTHER SUPREME 
COURT JUSTICE, I COULD PICK 
ANOTHER ONE, ANOTHER ONE, 
ANOTHER ONE, THIS COULD GO ON 
FOREVER.
SOMEBODY COULD COME AND SAY, 30 
YEARS AGO, 25 YEARS AGO, 10 
YEARS AGO, 5 YEARS AGO, HE DID A
HORRIBLE THING TO ME.
HE DID THIS, HE DID THAT, HE DID
THAT.
AND HONESTLY, IT'S A VERY 
DANGEROUS PERIOD IN OUR COUNTRY.
AND IT'S BEING PERPETRATED BY 
SOME VERY EVIL PEOPLE, SOME OF 
THEM ARE DEMOCRATS, I MUST SAY, 
BECAUSE SOME OF THEM KNOW THAT 
THIS IS JUST A GAME THAT THEY'RE
PLAYING.
IT'S A CON GAME, IT'S AT THE 
HIGHEST LEVEL.
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE UNITED 
STATES SUPREME COURT.
THIS CAN GO ON FOREVER.
I CAN PICK FIVE OTHER PEOPLE AT 
A CERTAIN POINT, PEOPLE ARE 
GOING TO SAY, NO THANK YOU.
THIS IS THE MOST COVETED JOB, 
PROBABLY IN THE WORLD.
AND, YOU KNOW WHAT, I WOULD 
HONESTLY SAY, BECAUSE I 
INTERVIEWED GREAT PEOPLE FOR 
THIS JOB, HE'S GREAT, BUT I 
INTERVIEWED OTHER GREAT PEOPLE 
FOR THIS JOB.
I COULD CONCEIVABLY IMAGINE 
GOING TO ONE OF THEM AND SAYING,
IT'S TOO BAD WHAT HAPPENED TO 
THIS WONDERFUL MAN.
BUT I'M GOING TO CHOOSE YOU 
NUMBER TWO.
I WANT YOU TO GO, AND I COULD 
CONCEIVABLY BE TURNED DOWN BY 
SOMEBODY THAT DESPERATELY WANTED
THIS JOB TWO MONTHS AGO.
SO, THIS IS -- 
>> WITH RESPECT SIR -- 
>> THIS IS BEYOND SUPREME COURT.
THERE'S NOTHING BEYOND SUPREME 
COURT, THIS IS BEYOND SUPREME 
COURT.
THIS IS EVERYTHING TO DO WITH 
OUR COUNTRY.
WHEN YOU ARE GUILTY, UNTIL 
PROVEN INNOCENT, IT'S JUST NOT 
SUPPOSED TO BE THAT WAY.
ALWAYS I HEARD YOU'RE INNOCENT 
UNTIL PROVEN GUILTY.
I'VE HEARD THIS FOR SO LONG AND 
IT'S SUCH A BEAUTIFUL PHRASE.
IN THIS CASE, YOU'RE GUILTY 
UNTIL PROVEN INNOCENT.
I THINK THAT IS A VERY, VERY 
DANGEROUS STANDARD FOR OUR 
COUNTRY.
WITH THAT BEING SAID, I LOOK 
FORWARD TO WHAT SHE HAS TO SAY.
I ALSO LOOK VERY FORWARD TO WHAT
JUDGE KAVANAUGH HAS TO SAY.
I THINK IT'S GOING TO BE A VERY,
VERY IMPORTANT DAY IN THE 
HISTORY OF OUR COUNTRY.
I WANT TO THANK YOU ALL.
WE'LL DO IT AGAIN.
>> SIR, THE MESSAGE TO YOUNG 
MEN?
YOUNG TEENAGER MEN?
NOTHING TO SAY, SIR?
>> WELL, THAT WAS SOMETHING.
ABOUT AN HOUR AND 20 MINUTES 
FROM PRESIDENT TRUMP, 
FREE-WHEELING, AT TIMES 
FACTUALLY CHALLENGED PRESS 
CONFERENCE.
CRITICIZED THE FEDERAL RESERVE 
FOR RAISING INTEREST RATES.
CRITICISM FOR CHINA.
SEEMED TO SAY THERE WAS NOT 
GOING TO BE A TRADE DEAL WITH 
CANADA AND CHINA.
CRITICIZING THEIR INTERFERENCE 
IN OUR ELECTION.
AND THE PRESIDENT, THE HEART OF 
THE PRESS CONFERENCE, OF COURSE,
THOSE QUESTIONS ABOUT BRETT 
KAVANAUGH, THREE WOMEN HAVE NOW 
COME FORWARD WITH ACCUSATIONS 
AGAINST BRETT KAVANAUGH.
THE PRESIDENT CALLED THEM FALSE 
ACCUSATIONS, CALLED THIS ALL, 
RETURNED TO THIS PHRASE MANY 
TIMES, A BIG CON JOB RUN BY 
DEMOCRATS.
ALSO QUESTIONED WHY THE WOMEN 
HADN'T COME FORWARD EARLIER, BUT
AT THE SAME TIME, SAYING HE'S 
LOOKING FORWARD TO HEARING WHAT 
DR. FORD HAS TO SAY TOMORROW.
AND THAT HE COULD MAKE UP HIS 
MIND AFTER HEARING THAT.
I WANT TO BRING IN JON KARL, OUR
CHIEF WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT.
JON, IT'S HARD TO SUMMARIZE THAT
IN JUST A FEW WORDS.
BUT I'M NOT SURE THAT HE HELPED 
BRETT KAVANAUGH'S CASE TODAY.
>> AH, NO, GEORGE.
FIRST OF ALL, AN EXTRAORDINARY 
PERFORMANCE BY THE PRESIDENT.
BUT HE WAS ALL OVER THE MAP.
AT SOME POINTS, CALLING THIS A 
CON JOB, ALL OF THE ALLEGATIONS 
AGAINST BRETT KAVANAUGH.
AT OTHER TIMES, SOUNDING LIKE HE
MIGHT WELL CUT HIM LOOSE, IF HE 
DOESN'T LIKE WHAT HE HEARS AT 
THE HEARING.
HE EVEN SAID, GEORGE, THAT HE 
MAY CANCEL HIS MUCH-ANTICIPATED 
MEETING WITH THE DEPUTY ATTORNEY
GENERAL ROD ROSENSTEIN TOMORROW 
BECAUSE HE WANTS THE FOCUS, ALL 
THE FOCUS INCLUDING HIS OWN 
FOCUS, TO BE ON THAT HEARING 
TOMORROW WITH KAVANAUGH AND HIS 
ACCUSER, CHRISTINE BLASEY FORD.
>> AND THE PRESIDENT ADMITTING 
HIS OWN EXPERIENCE WITH WOMEN 
MAKING ACCUSATIONS AGAINST HIM 
FOR SEXUAL MISCONDUCT ALSO 
HAVING A GREAT IMPACT ON HIS -- 
ON HIS VIEWS ON THIS MATTER.
WE'RE GOING TO SIGN OFF RIGHT 
NOW, OF COURSE, WE'RE GOING TO 
BE COVERING THAT HEARING 
TOMORROW LIVE STARTING AT 10:00 
EASTERN, I'LL BE ANCHORING THAT 
COVERA
