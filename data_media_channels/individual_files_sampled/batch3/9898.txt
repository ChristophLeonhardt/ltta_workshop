COMMON GROUND AND BRINGS PEACE TO THE PENINSULA. GREG PALKOT IS LIVE IN SEOUL, SOUTH KOREA. GREG? HI, DANA. THERE'S A LOT OF HOPEFUL BUT CAUTIOUS WATCHING HERE IN SOUTH KOREA. DOINGS IN SINGAPORE, THIS PLACE RIGHT UNDER THE NUCLEAR GUN OF NORTH KOREA IN RECENT MONTHS AND RECENT YEARS. THERE WAS A CONVERSATION ON MONDAY BETWEEN PRESIDENT TRUMP AND SOUTH KOREAN PRESIDENT MOON JAE-IN. MOON WISHED HIM HOPES FOR A SUCCESSFUL SUMMIT BUT ALSO WARNED IN A STATEMENT AFTERWARDS THIS COULD ONLY BE THE START OF A PROCESS THAT COULD TAKE YEARS. WORD FROM SECRETARY STATE POMPEO THAT NEW SECURITY GUARANTEES MIGHT BE OFFERED NORTH KOREA IN ANY SUMMIT NEGOTIATIONS. THAT HAS FOLKS WONDERING ABOUT THE STATUS, THE FUTURE STATUS OF SOME 28,500 U.S. TROOPS THAT HAVE BEEN GUARDING THIS PLACE FOR SOME TIME. ALSO POSSIBLY A FORMAL END TO THE KOREAN WAR. THAT CONFLICT WAS HALTED WITH A CEASE FIRE, AN ARMISTICE 65 YEARS AGO. EVERYBODY WE TALKED TO SAID THAT COULD BE A COMPLICATED ISSUE THAT COULD TAKE TIME TO SORT OUT. ANOTHER SIGN OF CHANGE ABOUT 35 MILES TO THE NORTH OF WHERE WE ARE, ACROSS THE DMZ IN NORTH KOREA, STATE MEDIA DESCRIBED WITH PICTURES WHAT KIM JONG-UN WAS DOING FOR ITS PUBLIC, THE ACTIVITIES IN SINGAPORE. THIS IS SOMETHING UNUSUAL. FINALLY, PRESIDENT TRUMP. HE'S BEEN SEEN HERE IN MIXED CREWS. SOMETIMES HE'S DESCRIBED AS MORE UN PREDICTABLE UN PREDICTABL UNPRREDICTABL UNPREDDICTABL UNPREDICCTABL UNPREDICTAABL UNPREDICTABLL UNPREDICTABLE UNPREDICTABLE A UNPREDICTABLE AS UNPREDICTABLE AS K UNPREDICTABLE AS KIM UNPREDICTABLE AS KIM JO UNPREDICTABLE AS KIM JONG UNPREDICTABLE AS KIM JONG-U UNPREDICTABLE AS KIM JONG-UN. PEEP IN THE GOVERNMENT AND PUBLIC SAY HE SHOULD BE GIVEN CREDIT FOR MOVING THIS SITUATION TO WHERE IT IS NOW, A SIT-DOWN BETWEEN THESE TWO LEADERS. HERE'S WHAT ONE ANALYST TOLD US. TAKE A LISTEN. WE ON THE KOREAN PENINSULA WILL BE LOOKING AT IT FROM THE POINT OF VIEW OF WHAT IS IN IT FOR US. FROM THAT PERSPECTIVE, THIS MAN IS A REVOLUTIONARY. A REVOLUTIONARY? HE'S DONE SOMETHING THAT NOBODY ELSE HAS BEEN WILLING TO DO. SOMETHING THAT NO ONE ELSE IS WILLING TO DO, SIT DOWN WE LEARNED TUESDAY, TWO HOURS TUESDAY ONE TO ONE. BACK TO YOU. Dana: GREG, DO YOU THINK THAT THE NORTH KOREAN STATE TELEVISION LET THAT INFORMATION KNOWN ABOUT KIM JONG-UN'S WHEREABOUTS BECAUSE OF SOCIAL MEDIA AND THE INTERNET? THEY TRY TO CLAMP DOWN THAT IT'S HARDER TO KEEP INFORMATION LIKE THAT AWAY FROM EVERYBODY. THE SECOND QUESTION, DO YOU FEEL LIKE THE PEACE DEAL SHOULD BE HELD BACK BECAUSE IT'S LEVERAGE FOR THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES IF KIM JONG-UN DOESN'T WANT TO GO THE FULL THE COMPLETE VERIFIABLE, IRREVOCABLE DENUCLEARIZATION? DANA, TO YOUR FIRST POINT, YES. THAT'S WHAT I THOUGHT, TOO. FROM OUR TIMES IN NORTH KOREA, WE'RE LEARNING THAT MORE AND MORE INFORMATION IS GETTING TO THE PUBLIC IN THE NORTH AND THE REGIME THOUGHT THEY MIGHT NOT HOLD IT BACK. ANOTHER WAY OF LOOKING AT IT, THIS SHOWS A BIT OF A RESPONSIBILITY FOR WHAT IS GOING ON IN SINGAPORE AND COULD BE POSITIVELY THAT THE REGIME IS TALKING ABOUT THIS EVENT BEFORE IT HAPPENED. AS FOR THE PEACE TREATY, YES, IT IS NUMBER 1, COMPLICATED, AND NUMBER 2, COULD BE LEVERAGE FOR
