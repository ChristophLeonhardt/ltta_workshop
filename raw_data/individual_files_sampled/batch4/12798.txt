now before we get going here into the topic at hand I I got to tell you I just stopped at the store a few minutes ago and I was walking out to my car and I see I mean you know I see this all the time and anyone who's been following me for a while you know that I've complained about this it's not a complaint it's more of a campaign of awareness I have been in the midst of a an awareness campaign for years now about this problem but it was just it was one of the worst I've seen I think because it's been it's rainy here and people are just so they get even lazier and they just want to get back to their cars but I'm walking back to my car they're they're just shopping carts strewn everywhere in the parking lot all over the plur there was even one that was turned upside down so somebody had turned it upside down you know so that it wouldn't roll into somebody's car which thank you for that but there's also there are these cart Corral's positioned okay you know the cart into places where you can return your car to there's like seven of them positioned all throughout this parking lot so that no matter where you're parked you could not possibly be more than like twenty or thirty feet from one of them yet even the twenty or thirty feet is too far for people to walk so they just they said I'll just leave my cart here I'll even turn it upside down maybe but most people just leave it like I'll just leave it here because it's rainy and windy and I don't wanna have to walk twenty or thirty feet well guess what it's rainy and windy that means that the wind is gonna come and blow your cart which has wheels and it's gonna blow it probably into somebody else's parked vehicle and cause damage to their vehicle because you are too lazy to walk twenty or thirty feet or got it now you might say well what if I'm in a parking lot where they don't have cart Corral's I don't have to walk all the way back to the store and return it to the store oh my goodness what a what a tragedy that would be the you might have to walk forty feet then 40 whole feet how could you possibly manage to do that well I'll tell you how you manage to do it you I mean how whatever process you followed in order to get the cart to begin with just do that again repeat that process and ever you did however you managed whatever whatever whatever magic trick you had to pull in order to initially come in contact with that cart do that again in Reverse and Lee and and and that's how you could put the card away it's really not that difficult this is now if you want to if you want this is there is no greater evidence of the of the disintegration of human society than shopping carts that people just leave all over a parking lot um anyway um I wrote a piece on Friday published Friday night and you know I was making a point about the the scandals in in the Catholic Church and as I as I and I want to try to elaborate on this argument if you didn't read the piece or even if you did point that I was trying to make is that the sex abuse scandal in the church is is is not a pedophilia scandal okay the problem isn't pedophilia unlike what we're told and what you hear in the media about all the so-called pedophile priests and so on the problem is not pedophilia the problem is gay priests in the church and the statistics bear this out this is not me judge not this is not a theory that I'm positing this is just a fact it's really indisputable this is what statistics show and most prominently there was something called the John Jay report that was I think the most extensive report published on the sex scandal in the church and it shows that the vast majority of victims the vast majority of victims were male and the vast majority were not prepubescent children and pedophilia by definition is the sexual assault of a prepubescent child so by definition most of this was not pedophilia and then on top of that of course every single perpetrator was male obviously so what does that tell us that tells us that what happened in the church and it's may still be happening to some extent is an epidemic of gay men assaulting mostly teenage boys now it is true that that very same study that I mentioned the John Jay report it you know you can there are there are people who are looking to absolve the gay priests and so they will point to that very same study because that study did also try to claim that homosexuality had nothing to do with the assaults although it said statistically that them in the majority cases this these were these were men assaulting teenage boys or post pubescent boys they said in the report well but it had nothing to do with homosexuality had nothing to do with orientation but this is an assumption I think a a ridiculous assumption that is not borne out by the statistics what what the researchers tried to say is that well yes this was all male-on-male stuff but it wasn't because of orientation but how could that possibly be the case you mean a man who molest a fourteen-year-old boy doesn't have a homosexual orientation then what does he have if that's not a homosexual orientation then what is it and of course this problem encompasses more than just the assault of minors homosexuality is rampant in the priesthood there was an article in Slate few years ago which is and I and I cite this because it's far from most conservative publication but an article in Satan's lates adapted from a book called the sex effect which details how homosexuality became so common in the priesthood and now they now they say it's between 15 and 50 percent of priests are gay now that's a really wide margin okay between 15 and 50 percent and I think that 50% is probably overstating it considerably but the point is that homosexuals are are significantly over-represented in the priesthood in comparison to society at large and this is a process that really kicked into high gear as it were in the 60s and 70s so the priesthood started to become a haven for gay men in the 60s and then also in the 60s the molestation of altar boys started to become a huge problem hmm so in the 60s you've got a bunch of homosexuals who start to join the priesthood and the priesthood becomes becomes becomes a haven for homosexuality and then around that same time you've got a bunch of teenage boys who are being molested and assaulted by priests is it is it is it possible to see a connection between those two things could we possibly connect them maybe is it just a coincidence that gay priests exist in such large numbers protected by gay cabal's in the church and at the same time there happened to be a bunch of priests molesting pubescent boys can we really claim that those two realities are completely distinct and separate and that there is no bridge connecting them whatsoever let's consider let's taking a consideration the case of Cardinal McCarrick is one of the most prominent Cardinals in in the United States in the world really and he's been I think he's in his 70s maybe older now so he's been around for a long time he's been accused of preying upon young boys including an eleven year old boy so he has been accused of molesting boys so this is another example of minors being assaulted but when those accusations started coming out and then all this other information about Cardinal McCarrick came out most of the stories that have come out about him revolve around his sexual exploits with seminarians and seminarians are grown men in their 20s so it's probably true that he did he was grooming and molesting boys but we know that he was he was also involved in a lot of sexual activity with grown men yet we're told that his homosexuality is irrelevant or even according to the media and according to apologists they'll even say well he's not a homosexual because he's interested in children well but if he's not homosexual then why is he involved with all these grown men as well in fact all of these priests who was of who have who have assaulted boys you tell me you really think that they haven't also been involved with men as well I mean how could that be if Cardinal McCarrick were not a homosexual then isn't it true that he would not have molested boys how could we possibly dispute this and that's not to claim that all homosexuals molest boys but that is the claim that among men only homosexuals molest boys a non homosexual by definition would not be attracted to males so even if they even if a non homosexual is a scumbag sex predator there are plenty in that category heterosexuals who are also make sex predators but they're not gonna go after boys because they're not attracted to males because they're not homosexuals a lot of people for some reason I've been angry at me for saying this and they've claimed that well a man who assaults a minor can't be gay because sexual assault is about power it's not about sex so these are men who want power and nothing more but this of course is absurd and you hear this a lot about about sexual assault well sexual assault is all about power it's not about sex it's not about orientation well of course it's about all of those things what do you mean it's just about power that's ridiculous if there are plenty of people out there who who enjoy having power and lording it over others and manipulating and coercing there are a lot of bad people like that but there are many ways to achieve power and domination over another person without getting sex involved into it so if you do achieve that power through sex then that tells me that there's something about the sex itself which obviously you enjoy so it is also about the sex 80% of the victims in the church have been males eighty percent so is it difficult to see how thousands of boys would have been spared this experience if there had not been so many homosexuals in the priesthood is that difficult to understand why do we have so much difficulty with this am I saying that by getting rid of the homosexuals in the priesthood we could all but solve the problem of sexual assault in the church yes that is exactly what I'm saying and this that eighty percent eighty percent of the victims are males 100% of the perpetrators are males so if there were no homosexual priests then those victims who were males would not have been victimized obviously or are we going to pretend that even a heterosexual may decide to molest a fifteen year old boy is that what we're going to pretend now for that for the sake of absolving the gay priests and absolving homosexuals of everything are we gonna actually pretend that and if so then honestly i have no idea what the words heterosexual and homosexual even mean anymore and i guess that's part of the point is that we're not supposed to know what any words mean because they mean you know whatever whatever essentially the left needs them to mean in the moment by the way you can accuse me of homophobia all you want but it's not as though i am one who ignores cases of heterosexual abuse no in fact i think i'm one of the only people in america who is not ignoring the epidemic of mostly heterosexual abuse in the school system i talk about that all the time hardly anyone else talks about it there's basically no public interest in the in in this epidemic and i have not been able to drum up hardly any public interest I mean I wrote a I wrote an article all about the sexual assault epidemic and I had all the statistics and they are startling shocking horrifying statistics of just how prevalent sexual assault is in the in the school system and I wrote about this you know a couple months ago and I think the article got like 10,000 views nobody cared nobody nobody just nobody's interested they just don't care they don't want to hear about it but not for lacking not for lack of trying on my part sex abuse in the schools is is many times more common than it is in the Catholic Church and this is this mostly consists of men assaulting girl students and women assaulting boy students this is a big problem too and what do I say about that I say and I have said many times that look it's probably not a good idea to have women in their 20s teaching teenage boys just like it's probably not a good idea to have men in their 20s teaching teenage girls and it may be true that we don't have much of a choice in the public school system and and and that probably is accurate but there are there are serious problems inherent in this arrangement and we are seeing those problems bear themselves out so ideally you know the ideal environment for education would be to segregate boys and girls and have them in completely different schools and especially when you get into the older grades with the older boys and the older girls in those grades you would have men teaching the boys in almost every case and for the girls you had you would have women teaching the girls that would be now I know that that is not for public schools that is not feasible it's never gonna happen but I'm saying that that is the ideal scenario and when you start mixing when you take heterosexual women in their 20s and you have them teaching sixteen year old boys it is not I'm not theorizing that maybe that could lead to problems I am observing that it has led to an enormous amount of problems same when when the gender when the genders are reversed in a similar way and and look this is not there's this really stupid thing people do where they they look at a reality like the reality I'm talking about now and they'll say yeah but you know it shouldn't be that way I mean it shouldn't be that we you should we should be able to have 25 year old women teaching sixteen and seventeen year old boys and we should be able to do that without any sexual activity happening which we should be able to yeah we should be able to but we are not able to okay that it that should be the case but it is not the case it's just not again I'm not making this up this is just the this is what's happening so we can either acknowledge the reality and adjust accordingly or we can just plunge ahead you know making no changes whatsoever and then nothing gets better in a similar way it is not a good idea to have homosexual men living together in seminaries and rector ease and working closely with teenage boys it is not a good idea this again is not a homophobic theory of my part this is just a fact and so if it's homophobic at all it is a homophobic fact it is not a good idea it will lead to problems and we have seen those problems in the Catholic Church bear themselves out for 50 years we have seen the problem manifest itself thousands and thousands and thousands of times for 50 years this is what happens when you take homosexual men especially when they're supposed to be supposed to be a religious environment of celibacy and chastity and you put them all together in a you know in in in houses together and then you have working with teenage boys this is what happens it is simply moral cowardice to hide from us it is moral cowardice and when I've been talking about this over the last few days I have been scolded many times by by supposed Christians and even yeah I've gotten a few messages from priests I've also gotten messages in support of what I'm saying from priests and from laypeople but I've got plenty of messages on the other end of that spectrum saying how dare you how dare you say this how dare you how dare you slander all of these gay priests how dare you implicate homosexuality in this scandal how dare you I am so upset at you okay it may may make you feel better to wear your finger and you know take the side take take sides with the world and say oh no we must never say anything critical of homosexuals at all ever I know that makes you feel better and I and I know that it does but you're being a coward you're just being a ridiculous coward and you know it because you know that what I'm saying is true it's the there is there is no argument against it it's just the reality and there are so many I mean the church when I say the church I mean the Christian Church I mean Chris and um Christianity itself in the West everybody it is it is it is infested with moral cowards who simply will not stand up and say even the most self-evident truths if those truths are politically incorrect one other point about this and I think it's important for us to realize because I've heard from some Protestants who say who say oh you know I'm so glad this doesn't happen in Archer I mean this is a Catholic problem you know this is what happens with Catholics I'm so glad this isn't a problem in our church well this is a problem in Protestant churches too this is a problem as well I say this is a problem in in in Christian among Christians in the West especially mainly read briefly from a New York Times article the three companies that insure a majority of Protestant churches say they typically receive upward of 260 reports a year of children younger than 18 being sexually abused by members of the clergy church staff members volunteers or congregants in Protestant churches 260 a year which actually averages out to more than have been victimized in the Catholic Church so this is a big problem in Protestant churches - it's not it's not taught and nobody talks about it just like with the public schools and nobody talks about it no one discusses it nobody seems to care because we have focused all of our energy on the Catholic Church but the reality is this is a societal problem that has bled into all of the churches and so this goes back to Jesus saying you know don't look at the speck in your brother's eye you've got a log in your own well it just so happens that among Christian churches they all have logs in their eyes and so you we all got to look at the logs with each Church has to look with at the logs within its own eyes you know this is a problem in society we see all you know so we see it in the religious institutions obviously we've seen it in media and Hollywood we see it in the public school system it's a societal problem and although the Christian Church should stand above these problems and should be a shining light in example to all is not what is happening because also over the last 50 60 70 years Christianity in the West has kind of allowed itself to sink down into the muck and the mud with secular culture and has become in so many ways an extension of secular culture not something that transcends it or stands above it or leads it or guides it and this is one terrible symptom of that problem so it's time for us to just look at the reality of the situation to face it and to act accordingly thanks for watching everybody thanks for listening Godspeed you
