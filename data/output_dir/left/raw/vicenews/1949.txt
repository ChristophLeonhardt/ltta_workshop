thanks for having me on the show

20
00:00:58,010 --> 00:01:00,270
specifically I wanted to talk about the

21
00:01:00,270 --> 00:01:03,270
article<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you wrote about prep and</font>

22
00:01:03,270 --> 00:01:06,710
about how maybe<font color="#E5E5E5"> US doctors are hindering</font>

23
00:01:06,710 --> 00:01:11,130
HIV prevention and you got very graphic

24
00:01:11,130 --> 00:01:13,439
early on<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the article which I</font>

25
00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:16,619
appreciated by quoting someone that says

26
00:01:16,619 --> 00:01:19,439
that their doctor uh potentially or

27
00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:21,900
allegedly asked them if they wanted to

28
00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:25,770
be a cumdumpster but my<font color="#E5E5E5"> question goes a</font>

29
00:01:25,770 --> 00:01:28,380
little bit in a different direction to

30
00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:32,310
actually organizations mainly AIDS

31
00:01:32,310 --> 00:01:34,380
Healthcare Foundation they have been

32
00:01:34,380 --> 00:01:38,759
very very adamantly let's<font color="#E5E5E5"> just say</font>

33
00:01:38,759 --> 00:01:42,390
they've been loudly against really

34
00:01:42,390 --> 00:01:45,570
getting behind prep like the rest of the

35
00:01:45,570 --> 00:01:48,899
world their organizations the CDC the

36
00:01:48,899 --> 00:01:53,250
World<font color="#E5E5E5"> Health Organization the HRC the</font>

37
00:01:53,250 --> 00:01:55,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">White House now with the strategic HIV</font>

38
00:01:55,710 --> 00:01:58,590
strategy update that just happened

39
00:01:58,590 --> 00:02:02,009
everyone's behind using prep or if it's

40
00:02:02,009 --> 00:02:03,570
right for people<font color="#E5E5E5"> but AIDS Healthcare</font>

41
00:02:03,570 --> 00:02:06,509
Foundation has spent tons of money to

42
00:02:06,509 --> 00:02:08,098
kind of tell everyone why it's not a

43
00:02:08,098 --> 00:02:10,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">good idea do you think that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is helpful</font>

44
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:13,860
in the grand scheme of the discussion

45
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:17,310
and is a possibility that Michael

46
00:02:17,310 --> 00:02:19,350
Weinstein with<font color="#CCCCCC"> a child AIDS Healthcare</font>

47
00:02:19,350 --> 00:02:23,460
Foundation has actually caused a lot of

48
00:02:23,460 --> 00:02:27,660
this confusion so first actually let's

49
00:02:27,660 --> 00:02:29,400
back up because<font color="#E5E5E5"> some people might not</font>

50
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:32,040
know what<font color="#CCCCCC"> truvada is what prep is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we're</font>

51
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:33,180
throwing all these words around so I

52
00:02:33,180 --> 00:02:35,580
wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to find them first</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> so first</font>

53
00:02:35,580 --> 00:02:37,740
<font color="#CCCCCC">truvada is one of the antiretroviral</font>

54
00:02:37,740 --> 00:02:39,870
drugs that is prescribed to AIDS

55
00:02:39,870 --> 00:02:42,690
patients or AIDS patients goodness HIV

56
00:02:42,690 --> 00:02:44,760
patients to sort of keep their viral

57
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:46,890
loads down to make<font color="#CCCCCC"> sure that they don't</font>

58
00:02:46,890 --> 00:02:52,770
get really sick so<font color="#E5E5E5"> then what they'll do</font>

59
00:02:52,770 --> 00:02:56,340
for prevention miss<font color="#CCCCCC"> truvada as prep is</font>

60
00:02:56,340 --> 00:02:59,760
to give sort of the full dose of one of

61
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:02,160
three antiretrovirals this one is

62
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:05,550
<font color="#CCCCCC">truvada which is actually I believe a</font>

63
00:03:05,550 --> 00:03:07,440
combination of two antiretrovirals<font color="#E5E5E5"> yeah</font>

64
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:11,130
it is getting<font color="#E5E5E5"> look confusing myself but</font>

65
00:03:11,130 --> 00:03:13,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">basically what they'll do is they will</font>

66
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:16,620
prescribe that every day to people who

67
00:03:16,620 --> 00:03:22,049
are<font color="#E5E5E5"> at risk of getting HIV so this the</font>

68
00:03:22,049 --> 00:03:25,860
CDC says is is anyone<font color="#E5E5E5"> who is having sex</font>

69
00:03:25,860 --> 00:03:29,820
without condoms with partners who may or

70
00:03:29,820 --> 00:03:32,459
may not have HIV so if you don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font>

71
00:03:32,459 --> 00:03:34,560
and you're not always using new condom

72
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:35,820
this is sort of<font color="#E5E5E5"> something</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that you can</font>

73
00:03:35,820 --> 00:03:37,769
do to<font color="#CCCCCC"> protect yourself and the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> CDC</font>

74
00:03:37,769 --> 00:03:39,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">recommends it as you said the world</font>

75
00:03:39,660 --> 00:03:41,220
health organization recommends it a

76
00:03:41,220 --> 00:03:42,720
bunch of<font color="#E5E5E5"> other organizations recommended</font>

77
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:46,310
the AIDS Healthcare Foundation is

78
00:03:46,310 --> 00:03:48,810
questioning it they're saying well is

79
00:03:48,810 --> 00:03:54,060
the CDC right about this and<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're</font>

80
00:03:54,060 --> 00:03:57,390
advertising sort of that question and

81
00:03:57,390 --> 00:03:59,820
your question is is this causing harm is

82
00:03:59,820 --> 00:04:02,549
this causing confusion with doctors and

83
00:04:02,549 --> 00:04:05,010
I i mean i think that doctors are paying

84
00:04:05,010 --> 00:04:06,690
<font color="#CCCCCC">attention to the CDC and the World</font>

85
00:04:06,690 --> 00:04:10,470
Health Organization so I I think that

86
00:04:10,470 --> 00:04:14,180
that's important to sort of keep in mind

87
00:04:14,180 --> 00:04:16,579
should they question things I mean

88
00:04:16,579 --> 00:04:18,750
everybody should question things all the

89
00:04:18,750 --> 00:04:21,540
time is it causing confusion<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think</font>

90
00:04:21,540 --> 00:04:23,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">that from what I can see and I'm</font>

91
00:04:23,550 --> 00:04:25,020
actually curious about what you're

92
00:04:25,020 --> 00:04:27,389
seeing sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of out there but but</font>

93
00:04:27,389 --> 00:04:29,520
sort of my conversations people are

94
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:31,770
asking the question what is this how do

95
00:04:31,770 --> 00:04:33,780
I get it who do i need to ask about<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

96
00:04:33,780 --> 00:04:35,099
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> i actually haven't seen a whole lot</font>

97
00:04:35,099 --> 00:04:36,810
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> well maybe I shouldn't take it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I I</font>

98
00:04:36,810 --> 00:04:40,080
haven't heard<font color="#CCCCCC"> that have you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> uh yeah I</font>

99
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:42,120
mean it's a good question and actually I

100
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:44,490
have I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> lot of the yeah a lot of</font>

101
00:04:44,490 --> 00:04:46,349
the talking points<font color="#CCCCCC"> that I see on social</font>

102
00:04:46,349 --> 00:04:49,229
media come directly from some of that

103
00:04:49,229 --> 00:04:53,520
propaganda against the prevention method

104
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:56,520
and and let me just<font color="#E5E5E5"> State this for the</font>

105
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:58,590
record<font color="#CCCCCC"> that I don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> believe that</font>

106
00:04:58,590 --> 00:05:00,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">everyone should that's HIV negative</font>

107
00:05:00,810 --> 00:05:03,029
should be on prep I think that it's the

108
00:05:03,029 --> 00:05:04,620
conversation<font color="#CCCCCC"> that should happen between</font>

109
00:05:04,620 --> 00:05:07,889
a patient and a physician or anybody

110
00:05:07,889 --> 00:05:09,689
else involved in<font color="#CCCCCC"> that decision making</font>

111
00:05:09,689 --> 00:05:11,699
and that we should support<font color="#E5E5E5"> whatever</font>

112
00:05:11,699 --> 00:05:14,580
decision is made from that I'm I'm about

113
00:05:14,580 --> 00:05:17,129
informed decisions and then not judging

114
00:05:17,129 --> 00:05:20,339
people based on<font color="#E5E5E5"> that however with all of</font>

115
00:05:20,339 --> 00:05:23,960
that disclaimer the statistics<font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font>

116
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:29,610
amazing at prep preventing HIV maybe it

117
00:05:29,610 --> 00:05:33,569
doesn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> prevent STDs uh but the point of</font>

118
00:05:33,569 --> 00:05:36,990
<font color="#CCCCCC">that medication is to prevent HIV and</font>

119
00:05:36,990 --> 00:05:40,289
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that very</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> very well if it's</font>

120
00:05:40,289 --> 00:05:43,139
taken with<font color="#CCCCCC"> today well yeah well in it</font>

121
00:05:43,139 --> 00:05:46,860
still yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> absolutely which adherence is</font>

122
00:05:46,860 --> 00:05:48,810
is always a concern but even when it

123
00:05:48,810 --> 00:05:52,919
hasn't been taken every day the next

124
00:05:52,919 --> 00:05:54,569
question that I have for you is like

125
00:05:54,569 --> 00:05:56,939
<font color="#E5E5E5">wear condoms fit into the entire</font>

126
00:05:56,939 --> 00:06:02,270
discussion prep<font color="#CCCCCC"> truvada is the only</font>

127
00:06:02,270 --> 00:06:06,000
fda-approved prevention method for HIV

128
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,360
at all condoms have never even been

129
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:11,909
tested or approved for anal sex by<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

130
00:06:11,909 --> 00:06:15,360
<font color="#CCCCCC">FDA in 25 years it's crazy to me that</font>

131
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:18,870
that we can't even<font color="#E5E5E5"> get them to test and</font>

132
00:06:18,870 --> 00:06:20,009
so it makes you<font color="#E5E5E5"> wonder do they know</font>

133
00:06:20,009 --> 00:06:22,409
something we don't I'm not against

134
00:06:22,409 --> 00:06:24,719
condoms all I'm saying is if we know

135
00:06:24,719 --> 00:06:28,610
prep works then we<font color="#E5E5E5"> should support it but</font>

136
00:06:28,610 --> 00:06:32,699
Gilead is not not even<font color="#CCCCCC"> really putting</font>

137
00:06:32,699 --> 00:06:35,310
money towards it why do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you think that</font>

138
00:06:35,310 --> 00:06:37,979
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> aren't they the beneficiaries</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

139
00:06:37,979 --> 00:06:40,620
people taking<font color="#CCCCCC"> the medication side</font>

140
00:06:40,620 --> 00:06:45,290
I mean financially in theory<font color="#CCCCCC"> yes um so</font>

141
00:06:45,290 --> 00:06:50,610
actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> I thought</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about this so the</font>

142
00:06:50,610 --> 00:06:54,540
short answer is I don't know up but I

143
00:06:54,540 --> 00:06:56,580
did look into have you ever looked at

144
00:06:56,580 --> 00:06:59,820
ProPublica's dollars for docs do you

145
00:06:59,820 --> 00:07:01,650
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm talking yeah it I've heard</font>

146
00:07:01,650 --> 00:07:03,660
<font color="#CCCCCC">about it I have it so basically</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font>

147
00:07:03,660 --> 00:07:05,520
online you can check it out and what

148
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:07,080
they've done is they've looked<font color="#E5E5E5"> at how</font>

149
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:10,320
much pharma companies are spending by

150
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:13,320
paying doctors to sort of speak publicly

151
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:16,949
at conferences how often<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're you</font>

152
00:07:16,949 --> 00:07:20,190
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> taking them out to meals to talk to</font>

153
00:07:20,190 --> 00:07:22,229
them about drugs etc etc and we<font color="#E5E5E5"> sort of</font>

154
00:07:22,229 --> 00:07:24,900
know that<font color="#CCCCCC"> this happens across Varma and</font>

155
00:07:24,900 --> 00:07:27,750
then so i looked i<font color="#E5E5E5"> used this tool and I</font>

156
00:07:27,750 --> 00:07:32,720
looked up Gilead and I saw<font color="#E5E5E5"> that their</font>

157
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:36,510
thousand-dollar hepatitis C pill now I'm

158
00:07:36,510 --> 00:07:38,789
forgetting the name<font color="#CCCCCC"> saval d I believe it</font>

159
00:07:38,789 --> 00:07:41,760
is that they spent somewhere in the

160
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:46,260
neighborhood of 2.5 million on that but

161
00:07:46,260 --> 00:07:47,970
then I looked down and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> found</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> truvada</font>

162
00:07:47,970 --> 00:07:49,950
and it's not even broken down between

163
00:07:49,950 --> 00:07:52,889
<font color="#CCCCCC">truvada and truvada</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is prep and they</font>

164
00:07:52,889 --> 00:07:55,740
only spent<font color="#CCCCCC"> 55 thousand so and that's</font>

165
00:07:55,740 --> 00:07:58,470
again not on<font color="#E5E5E5"> TV ads or print ads or</font>

166
00:07:58,470 --> 00:08:00,270
anything like that that's just<font color="#E5E5E5"> how</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> much</font>

167
00:08:00,270 --> 00:08:03,690
they're spending on doctors and on this

168
00:08:03,690 --> 00:08:05,729
sort of promotional dollars for docs

169
00:08:05,729 --> 00:08:08,520
front so I mean it's definitely<font color="#E5E5E5"> worth</font>

170
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:11,699
exploring but I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't know the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> exact</font>

171
00:08:11,699 --> 00:08:13,889
answer as to why that's sort of the fact

172
00:08:13,889 --> 00:08:15,270
to it that I came<font color="#E5E5E5"> up</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with when I was</font>

173
00:08:15,270 --> 00:08:17,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">thinking</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about this question that's</font>

174
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:19,889
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> interesting and good for you for</font>

175
00:08:19,889 --> 00:08:23,580
finding that so d one thing that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm</font>

176
00:08:23,580 --> 00:08:26,250
finding in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the south and I'm a very</font>

177
00:08:26,250 --> 00:08:28,919
outspoken hiv-positive activist that

178
00:08:28,919 --> 00:08:31,470
uses social media to encourage people

179
00:08:31,470 --> 00:08:33,958
but also hold people accountable like

180
00:08:33,958 --> 00:08:36,809
insurance companies or prescription

181
00:08:36,809 --> 00:08:38,490
benefit companies and one thing in your

182
00:08:38,490 --> 00:08:42,570
article that that I I thought was really

183
00:08:42,570 --> 00:08:45,480
important is that this almost

184
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:48,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">shaming</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I think is how the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the article</font>

185
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:49,770
phrased it and I've<font color="#E5E5E5"> heard other places</font>

186
00:08:49,770 --> 00:08:53,050
but that really is<font color="#CCCCCC"> happening</font>

187
00:08:53,050 --> 00:08:57,010
I in I'm in Nashville and in Tennessee

188
00:08:57,010 --> 00:09:00,190
I've started an underground like dr.

189
00:09:00,190 --> 00:09:02,920
list for people that are negative that

190
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:05,380
go to their regular physicians and

191
00:09:05,380 --> 00:09:08,050
aren't able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get the prescription that</font>

192
00:09:08,050 --> 00:09:10,630
they want because their doctor says oh

193
00:09:10,630 --> 00:09:14,500
I'm too conservative for that um which

194
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:16,240
I'm like you're not got<font color="#E5E5E5"> it you don't</font>

195
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:18,459
have to take<font color="#E5E5E5"> the medicine you know so it</font>

196
00:09:18,459 --> 00:09:20,920
shouldn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> be about you doctor but I've</font>

197
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:23,560
sort of an<font color="#E5E5E5"> underground list that that</font>

198
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:26,589
basically provides prep friendly doctors

199
00:09:26,589 --> 00:09:30,880
or at least how people can get it but

200
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:33,430
one thing that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> don't think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is that</font>

201
00:09:33,430 --> 00:09:35,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">we've talked enough about is what if</font>

202
00:09:35,380 --> 00:09:39,339
condoms took fifty four weeks to get

203
00:09:39,339 --> 00:09:42,610
access<font color="#E5E5E5"> to and that's how long and I've</font>

204
00:09:42,610 --> 00:09:44,950
posted an article on my blog at someone

205
00:09:44,950 --> 00:09:47,230
in Louisiana it took fifty four weeks

206
00:09:47,230 --> 00:09:49,750
for them to get access<font color="#E5E5E5"> from the day they</font>

207
00:09:49,750 --> 00:09:52,810
decided they wanted prep<font color="#CCCCCC"> truvada to the</font>

208
00:09:52,810 --> 00:09:54,610
day that<font color="#CCCCCC"> they had the pill in their hand</font>

209
00:09:54,610 --> 00:09:57,520
it was fifty four weeks<font color="#CCCCCC"> is probably</font>

210
00:09:57,520 --> 00:09:59,980
average from what I've learned sorry to

211
00:09:59,980 --> 00:10:03,339
interrupt you yeah no no and how does

212
00:10:03,339 --> 00:10:06,130
<font color="#CCCCCC">that really speak into</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> health care I</font>

213
00:10:06,130 --> 00:10:08,110
know the next article that<font color="#E5E5E5"> that people</font>

214
00:10:08,110 --> 00:10:10,570
that will talk about<font color="#E5E5E5"> is has to do with</font>

215
00:10:10,570 --> 00:10:13,420
just LGBT health care in general but but

216
00:10:13,420 --> 00:10:17,620
the access of the drug goes beyond just

217
00:10:17,620 --> 00:10:19,959
the doctors<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's then once you get the</font>

218
00:10:19,959 --> 00:10:21,750
prescription go into the pharmacy

219
00:10:21,750 --> 00:10:24,070
handing them your insurance card the

220
00:10:24,070 --> 00:10:26,649
insurance companies are denying it the

221
00:10:26,649 --> 00:10:29,110
first<font color="#E5E5E5"> round almost every time and then</font>

222
00:10:29,110 --> 00:10:31,270
you have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> appeal and then appeal again</font>

223
00:10:31,270 --> 00:10:33,760
and then they're finally saying okay<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

224
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:35,709
<font color="#E5E5E5">know we'll cover it or we'll cover</font>

225
00:10:35,709 --> 00:10:37,089
partial of it but don't you think that

226
00:10:37,089 --> 00:10:40,300
speaks larger to kind of these problems

227
00:10:40,300 --> 00:10:42,970
that we have with LGBT health care in

228
00:10:42,970 --> 00:10:45,850
general I mean I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> it speaks i mean</font>

229
00:10:45,850 --> 00:10:50,440
honestly so so wait the concise question

230
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:54,820
is sorry so you want to know<font color="#CCCCCC"> just if you</font>

231
00:10:54,820 --> 00:10:56,350
could give<font color="#CCCCCC"> me the question in one</font>

232
00:10:56,350 --> 00:10:58,839
sentence sorry yeah no that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay and</font>

233
00:10:58,839 --> 00:11:00,490
giving in one sentence is probably

234
00:11:00,490 --> 00:11:02,079
impossible for me because I'm a talker

235
00:11:02,079 --> 00:11:05,320
but do you think that<font color="#CCCCCC"> the access to this</font>

236
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:06,579
medication

237
00:11:06,579 --> 00:11:10,959
translates to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> bigger problem</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of LGBT</font>

238
00:11:10,959 --> 00:11:14,980
health care in general not um those

239
00:11:14,980 --> 00:11:17,019
individuals not having the access that

240
00:11:17,019 --> 00:11:20,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">they need waiting for yeah I mean I</font>

241
00:11:20,350 --> 00:11:23,980
think yes so basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> like the issue</font>

242
00:11:23,980 --> 00:11:26,589
here is is sort of almost a personal

243
00:11:26,589 --> 00:11:28,179
bias is that sort of what you're getting

244
00:11:28,179 --> 00:11:30,519
at that sort of goes to the LGBT med

245
00:11:30,519 --> 00:11:31,809
school curriculum where they're sort of

246
00:11:31,809 --> 00:11:35,049
talking about<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know basically one of</font>

247
00:11:35,049 --> 00:11:36,309
<font color="#E5E5E5">the big things</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that they're teaching is</font>

248
00:11:36,309 --> 00:11:38,499
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay you can believe whatever</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you want</font>

249
00:11:38,499 --> 00:11:41,110
to believe about LGBT individuals but

250
00:11:41,110 --> 00:11:42,699
what you have to do as a doctor as

251
00:11:42,699 --> 00:11:46,059
<font color="#E5E5E5">whatever is put the patient first and</font>

252
00:11:46,059 --> 00:11:49,360
sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of push your individual implicit</font>

253
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:51,670
explicit biases aside and put the

254
00:11:51,670 --> 00:11:53,559
patient first and that's sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of what</font>

255
00:11:53,559 --> 00:11:55,720
they're now trying trying to teach down

256
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:58,119
at the University of Louisville and then

257
00:11:58,119 --> 00:12:00,129
to sort of just<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk very very briefly</font>

258
00:12:00,129 --> 00:12:01,600
and then I think we probably have to

259
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:04,959
<font color="#E5E5E5">move on about the prescription and</font>

260
00:12:04,959 --> 00:12:07,629
coverage and all of that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I would say to</font>

261
00:12:07,629 --> 00:12:12,089
everyone to look into any kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> Gilead</font>

262
00:12:12,089 --> 00:12:14,709
coupon program<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think that they do have</font>

263
00:12:14,709 --> 00:12:16,299
<font color="#E5E5E5">a program</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to sort of help people get</font>

264
00:12:16,299 --> 00:12:19,720
access to it and then certain states and

265
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:23,439
cities also have programs that sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

266
00:12:23,439 --> 00:12:25,629
help people get access to them and if

267
00:12:25,629 --> 00:12:26,889
you don't know<font color="#CCCCCC"> about them that's a</font>

268
00:12:26,889 --> 00:12:29,019
problem but like if<font color="#CCCCCC"> you're interested</font>

269
00:12:29,019 --> 00:12:32,619
look into it so yeah great thank you so

270
00:12:32,619 --> 00:12:35,110
<font color="#CCCCCC">much thank</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you yeah yeah we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> feel their</font>

271
00:12:35,110 --> 00:12:37,059
skype collars on right now but actually

272
00:12:37,059 --> 00:12:39,369
the tweet that just came in Aaron Brown

273
00:12:39,369 --> 00:12:40,480
wants to know what<font color="#E5E5E5"> does prep</font>

274
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:42,459
accessibility look like for undocumented

275
00:12:42,459 --> 00:12:44,410
people same<font color="#E5E5E5"> question for incarcerated</font>

276
00:12:44,410 --> 00:12:48,369
people who so the short answer is I'm

277
00:12:48,369 --> 00:12:51,339
not entirely sure but what we know is

278
00:12:51,339 --> 00:12:53,519
that sort of the most at-risk

279
00:12:53,519 --> 00:12:58,110
populations for for for contracting HIV

280
00:12:58,110 --> 00:13:03,429
our minority individuals minority gay

281
00:13:03,429 --> 00:13:06,579
individuals so it's very important to

282
00:13:06,579 --> 00:13:08,860
get it to them as far as i know i think

283
00:13:08,860 --> 00:13:11,829
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's probably less accessible to this</font>

284
00:13:11,829 --> 00:13:14,639
population and for incarcerated people

285
00:13:14,639 --> 00:13:18,929
that's that's another tough one because

286
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:22,540
you know these are<font color="#E5E5E5"> people who we know</font>

287
00:13:22,540 --> 00:13:26,920
you know pop maybe are having sex behind

288
00:13:26,920 --> 00:13:30,580
bars um make probably some of<font color="#E5E5E5"> them</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font>

289
00:13:30,580 --> 00:13:32,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">HIV positive it's definitely</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a good</font>

290
00:13:32,950 --> 00:13:35,140
question Erin I'm I just<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't know the</font>

291
00:13:35,140 --> 00:13:38,680
answer alright<font color="#E5E5E5"> great so next up we have</font>

292
00:13:38,680 --> 00:13:42,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">Anna on skype sahai dahana hi Sydney hi</font>

293
00:13:42,550 --> 00:13:44,410
Anna thanks for talking to me today

294
00:13:44,410 --> 00:13:48,130
thanks for<font color="#E5E5E5"> talking to me my first</font>

295
00:13:48,130 --> 00:13:50,650
question pertains both to your<font color="#CCCCCC"> truvada</font>

296
00:13:50,650 --> 00:13:53,230
shaming<font color="#E5E5E5"> piece and the LGBT med school</font>

297
00:13:53,230 --> 00:13:55,840
curriculum piece and it may may wonder

298
00:13:55,840 --> 00:13:58,000
<font color="#CCCCCC">how we could hold doctors accountable</font>

299
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,220
for what they<font color="#CCCCCC"> say that's discriminatory</font>

300
00:14:00,220 --> 00:14:03,160
or biased and that leads to negligent

301
00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:05,800
medical care when conversations between

302
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:07,780
doctors and patients often take place

303
00:14:07,780 --> 00:14:09,460
behind closed doors and with no

304
00:14:09,460 --> 00:14:12,550
eyewitnesses yeah so that's tough and

305
00:14:12,550 --> 00:14:14,890
actually sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of in my reporting i came</font>

306
00:14:14,890 --> 00:14:16,900
across sort of two different situations

307
00:14:16,900 --> 00:14:18,130
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> neither of them were really</font>

308
00:14:18,130 --> 00:14:21,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">perfectly resolved so we had the person</font>

309
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:24,730
in the beginning who alleged that when

310
00:14:24,730 --> 00:14:26,830
he asked for<font color="#CCCCCC"> truvada s prep he was</font>

311
00:14:26,830 --> 00:14:29,650
called a dumpster but<font color="#E5E5E5"> the thing is</font>

312
00:14:29,650 --> 00:14:33,400
he didn't you know you react to<font color="#E5E5E5"> that and</font>

313
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:36,339
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can imagine being horrified and you</font>

314
00:14:36,339 --> 00:14:38,650
feel terrible and the first<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing you</font>

315
00:14:38,650 --> 00:14:40,510
want to do is you know go home and bury

316
00:14:40,510 --> 00:14:44,470
your face in a pillow but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

317
00:14:44,470 --> 00:14:47,710
for if that ever happens to<font color="#E5E5E5"> anyone they</font>

318
00:14:47,710 --> 00:14:50,800
should report it to the organization

319
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:53,710
report like make a record of it make

320
00:14:53,710 --> 00:14:56,560
<font color="#CCCCCC">sure that the organization the doctor's</font>

321
00:14:56,560 --> 00:14:58,360
office knows that this happened make

322
00:14:58,360 --> 00:15:00,339
sure that the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Medical Board</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> knows that</font>

323
00:15:00,339 --> 00:15:02,530
this happened do whatever you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can to</font>

324
00:15:02,530 --> 00:15:04,570
make sure there's a record<font color="#E5E5E5"> of it so the</font>

325
00:15:04,570 --> 00:15:07,780
the other person in my LGBT med school

326
00:15:07,780 --> 00:15:11,410
program was the gay man who had strep

327
00:15:11,410 --> 00:15:14,140
throat mm-hmm and went into<font color="#E5E5E5"> the doctor's</font>

328
00:15:14,140 --> 00:15:16,089
office<font color="#E5E5E5"> and said I have a sore throat and</font>

329
00:15:16,089 --> 00:15:17,710
the doctor said what's your sexual

330
00:15:17,710 --> 00:15:20,050
orientation and<font color="#CCCCCC"> he answered honestly and</font>

331
00:15:20,050 --> 00:15:22,270
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> doctor said well you have HIV I</font>

332
00:15:22,270 --> 00:15:25,780
think and I<font color="#CCCCCC"> can't help you so that</font>

333
00:15:25,780 --> 00:15:29,110
person<font color="#CCCCCC"> did make a complaint and the</font>

334
00:15:29,110 --> 00:15:31,870
doctor alleged that<font color="#E5E5E5"> their responded by</font>

335
00:15:31,870 --> 00:15:32,620
saying this was

336
00:15:32,620 --> 00:15:35,410
actually an insurance dispute I wanted

337
00:15:35,410 --> 00:15:39,220
an HIV test he had had 13 weeks before

338
00:15:39,220 --> 00:15:40,690
but didn't have<font color="#E5E5E5"> a record of it because I</font>

339
00:15:40,690 --> 00:15:43,030
guess it was an<font color="#E5E5E5"> anonymous free testing</font>

340
00:15:43,030 --> 00:15:46,870
facility and she wanted a new test but

341
00:15:46,870 --> 00:15:49,360
he wasn't covered by insurance so he

342
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:50,860
wasn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> sure how much it would cost and</font>

343
00:15:50,860 --> 00:15:53,050
there was sort of a dispute there so the

344
00:15:53,050 --> 00:15:54,580
long story<font color="#E5E5E5"> short is that the Medical</font>

345
00:15:54,580 --> 00:15:57,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">Board and this was in Kentucky said well</font>

346
00:15:57,790 --> 00:15:59,440
we think that there<font color="#CCCCCC"> should be a warning</font>

347
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:02,200
<font color="#CCCCCC">led a letter of some kind in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

348
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:03,910
doctors file but<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's not enough for a</font>

349
00:16:03,910 --> 00:16:05,740
disciplinary action so it is hard i

350
00:16:05,740 --> 00:16:07,120
think when there's<font color="#CCCCCC"> this sort of hearsay</font>

351
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:09,670
situation but as a patient the best

352
00:16:09,670 --> 00:16:11,260
thing that anyone can do is make sure

353
00:16:11,260 --> 00:16:13,870
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> they report these things make sure</font>

354
00:16:13,870 --> 00:16:16,870
that there's a record because<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's</font>

355
00:16:16,870 --> 00:16:19,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">sort of your best your best bet going</font>

356
00:16:19,510 --> 00:16:24,250
<font color="#CCCCCC">forward that would be my advice great</font>

357
00:16:24,250 --> 00:16:26,710
thank<font color="#E5E5E5"> you mm-hmm and my</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> next question</font>

358
00:16:26,710 --> 00:16:28,620
has to do<font color="#CCCCCC"> with the med</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> school piece I</font>

359
00:16:28,620 --> 00:16:31,450
regarding transgender patients are the

360
00:16:31,450 --> 00:16:33,130
med students<font color="#E5E5E5"> at the University of</font>

361
00:16:33,130 --> 00:16:35,680
Louisville getting educated not just

362
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:37,930
some important sensitivity issues like

363
00:16:37,930 --> 00:16:40,960
pronoun miss usage or not you know

364
00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:43,030
having trans women in hospital rooms

365
00:16:43,030 --> 00:16:46,360
with men but also on a medical<font color="#CCCCCC"> treatment</font>

366
00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:49,690
specific to the trans population and for

367
00:16:49,690 --> 00:16:51,880
example<font color="#CCCCCC"> the right dosage</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and combination</font>

368
00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:54,610
of hormones for trans men or women or

369
00:16:54,610 --> 00:16:56,470
what the various<font color="#E5E5E5"> sex reassignment</font>

370
00:16:56,470 --> 00:17:00,220
surgeries are sure so first it's

371
00:17:00,220 --> 00:17:01,510
important<font color="#E5E5E5"> to note that with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this program</font>

372
00:17:01,510 --> 00:17:05,619
<font color="#E5E5E5">it is the first that sort it's the</font>

373
00:17:05,619 --> 00:17:08,470
University<font color="#CCCCCC"> of Louisville in Kentucky but</font>

374
00:17:08,470 --> 00:17:11,200
it's the first one<font color="#CCCCCC"> that pilot program</font>

375
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:12,640
through the Association of American

376
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:15,220
Medical Colleges and they've sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of set</font>

377
00:17:15,220 --> 00:17:17,440
I believe 30 different areas for

378
00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:19,329
standards where they want<font color="#E5E5E5"> them to be</font>

379
00:17:19,329 --> 00:17:20,560
part of the curriculum and what this is

380
00:17:20,560 --> 00:17:24,609
is the first you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know LGBT education is</font>

381
00:17:24,609 --> 00:17:26,710
sprinkled throughout the entire four

382
00:17:26,710 --> 00:17:29,440
years however<font color="#E5E5E5"> this just started so they</font>

383
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:30,640
were developing<font color="#CCCCCC"> the first year</font>

384
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:32,500
curriculum you know over the summer over

385
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:36,100
the last year so those kids kids adults

386
00:17:36,100 --> 00:17:39,010
young adults um started over the<font color="#E5E5E5"> summer</font>

387
00:17:39,010 --> 00:17:43,330
and are working<font color="#CCCCCC"> now</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think that</font>

388
00:17:43,330 --> 00:17:44,800
they'll probably go into those<font color="#CCCCCC"> things</font>

389
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:45,850
there are

390
00:17:45,850 --> 00:17:48,669
sort of there is research to say who

391
00:17:48,669 --> 00:17:51,340
needs what dosage of hormones if you're

392
00:17:51,340 --> 00:17:53,470
a smoker what do we do because<font color="#CCCCCC"> that puts</font>

393
00:17:53,470 --> 00:17:55,030
you at risk for blood clots sort of like

394
00:17:55,030 --> 00:17:56,919
if you're on birth control birth control

395
00:17:56,919 --> 00:17:59,020
and smoking can make blood clots and

396
00:17:59,020 --> 00:18:01,900
that's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> good so I imagine that those</font>

397
00:18:01,900 --> 00:18:03,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">things will be part of it but I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think</font>

398
00:18:03,610 --> 00:18:05,200
right<font color="#E5E5E5"> now we have to also keep in mind</font>

399
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:06,669
that they're<font color="#CCCCCC"> just in their first year so</font>

400
00:18:06,669 --> 00:18:07,929
I'm not sure how much they'll be getting

401
00:18:07,929 --> 00:18:11,620
into<font color="#E5E5E5"> it so I know that their first class</font>

402
00:18:11,620 --> 00:18:14,890
was a broad class on substance abuse and

403
00:18:14,890 --> 00:18:17,620
what they wanted to do was add in so

404
00:18:17,620 --> 00:18:19,299
it's not<font color="#CCCCCC"> just you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know this is</font>

405
00:18:19,299 --> 00:18:21,340
everything<font color="#E5E5E5"> you need to know about LGBT</font>

406
00:18:21,340 --> 00:18:23,080
people in one day<font color="#CCCCCC"> and it's an elective</font>

407
00:18:23,080 --> 00:18:25,150
course this is part of their entire

408
00:18:25,150 --> 00:18:26,830
curriculum and part of that one class

409
00:18:26,830 --> 00:18:30,490
was ok LGBT people are more at risk for

410
00:18:30,490 --> 00:18:32,500
this group and that group is more at

411
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:36,220
risk for substance abuse so it's sort of

412
00:18:36,220 --> 00:18:38,020
sprinkled in like that I imagine that

413
00:18:38,020 --> 00:18:39,940
it's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be more than just a</font>

414
00:18:39,940 --> 00:18:43,210
pronoun usage mm-hmm and in that scene

415
00:18:43,210 --> 00:18:45,340
piece I just had a question as purely

416
00:18:45,340 --> 00:18:48,580
curiosity and with the man who had the

417
00:18:48,580 --> 00:18:51,130
sore throat who the doctor said<font color="#CCCCCC"> oh you</font>

418
00:18:51,130 --> 00:18:55,330
have HIV and you didn't name him and in

419
00:18:55,330 --> 00:18:58,510
your piece and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I just wondering um the</font>

420
00:18:58,510 --> 00:19:00,280
journalistic decision behind that I know

421
00:19:00,280 --> 00:19:02,830
it was something about a letter you read

422
00:19:02,830 --> 00:19:06,789
a letter so it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> a public record so I</font>

423
00:19:06,789 --> 00:19:09,309
had the red letter I had<font color="#E5E5E5"> the response</font>

424
00:19:09,309 --> 00:19:12,250
from<font color="#E5E5E5"> the doctor etc but the reason that</font>

425
00:19:12,250 --> 00:19:15,010
I didn't name him is because even though

426
00:19:15,010 --> 00:19:17,110
this is a public record I wasn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> able to</font>

427
00:19:17,110 --> 00:19:19,600
reach him and I didn't want him<font color="#E5E5E5"> to sort</font>

428
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:22,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">of see this maybe I mean yes he wanted</font>

429
00:19:22,870 --> 00:19:25,480
to report it etc and and that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> good but</font>

430
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:28,299
maybe he you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> wasn't prepared to see</font>

431
00:19:28,299 --> 00:19:30,010
it in this way I just sort of wanted to

432
00:19:30,010 --> 00:19:31,419
give him some kind of warning that it

433
00:19:31,419 --> 00:19:33,250
would be on vice news and because i

434
00:19:33,250 --> 00:19:35,140
wasn't able to<font color="#E5E5E5"> reach him I was like well</font>

435
00:19:35,140 --> 00:19:37,690
I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is important it's clear</font>

436
00:19:37,690 --> 00:19:39,070
that this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a public record so we can</font>

437
00:19:39,070 --> 00:19:40,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">talk</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it but I'm not going to name</font>

438
00:19:40,450 --> 00:19:42,760
this guy just in case yeah that's very

439
00:19:42,760 --> 00:19:46,150

446
00:20:01,590 --> 00:20:04,990
before<font color="#CCCCCC"> we begin I wanted to address the</font>

447
00:20:04,990 --> 00:20:10,330
ongoing discussion of medical power such

448
00:20:10,330 --> 00:20:14,200
as in the erotic case with the

449
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:18,640
specifically the dumpster quote when

450
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:21,610
a doctor enters a room they already have

451
00:20:21,610 --> 00:20:24,910
an existing position of power over a

452
00:20:24,910 --> 00:20:27,280
patient<font color="#CCCCCC"> and a patient is already</font>

453
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:30,700
undergoing so much medical stress in

454
00:20:30,700 --> 00:20:33,789
their body that they're<font color="#CCCCCC"> just the active</font>

455
00:20:33,789 --> 00:20:38,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">advocating for themselves is like that's</font>

456
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:40,929
a force of political power<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mean that's</font>

457
00:20:40,929 --> 00:20:45,130
a force that I don't know that is a

458
00:20:45,130 --> 00:20:48,280
political act to speak up and advocate

459
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:50,049
<font color="#CCCCCC">for themselves in the room reporting</font>

460
00:20:50,049 --> 00:20:53,919
beyond that takes a like in a measure of

461
00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:57,909
strength beyond just speaking up mom I'm

462
00:20:57,909 --> 00:21:01,210
I'm a queer disabled woman I'm

463
00:21:01,210 --> 00:21:04,120
cisgendered so I don't deal with trans

464
00:21:04,120 --> 00:21:07,720
issues but I speak with many other

465
00:21:07,720 --> 00:21:10,390
people on a daily basis who talked a lot

466
00:21:10,390 --> 00:21:13,390
about the strength that you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know they</font>

467
00:21:13,390 --> 00:21:15,250
have to summon to just speak up for

468
00:21:15,250 --> 00:21:17,980
themselves with doctors who like

469
00:21:17,980 --> 00:21:19,990
disbelieve they're invisible illnesses

470
00:21:19,990 --> 00:21:24,360
and in the room<font color="#CCCCCC"> so it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> very difficult</font>

471
00:21:24,360 --> 00:21:29,679
which also says that when you're dealing

472
00:21:29,679 --> 00:21:31,630
with a care provider who kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of like</font>

473
00:21:31,630 --> 00:21:33,940
temporarily ignores their belief

474
00:21:33,940 --> 00:21:41,130
structure such as like with LGBT issues

475
00:21:41,130 --> 00:21:46,690
in order<font color="#CCCCCC"> to provide care is that going</font>

476
00:21:46,690 --> 00:21:49,150
to inhibit like the intimacy necessary

477
00:21:49,150 --> 00:21:55,090
in making difficult decisions so I feel

478
00:21:55,090 --> 00:21:56,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">like there were a couple questions in</font>

479
00:21:56,320 --> 00:21:58,419
there so I might break them up a<font color="#CCCCCC"> little</font>

480
00:21:58,419 --> 00:22:01,299
bit so let's tackle this one first and

481
00:22:01,299 --> 00:22:05,740
this is does sort of ignoring your

482
00:22:05,740 --> 00:22:07,399
belief system

483
00:22:07,399 --> 00:22:09,440
hurt your ability to sort of care for

484
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:10,429
the patient and I think in this

485
00:22:10,429 --> 00:22:13,669
situation what they're saying what the

486
00:22:13,669 --> 00:22:16,279
curriculum is is trying to do is sort of

487
00:22:16,279 --> 00:22:18,349
acknowledge that you know yes there are

488
00:22:18,349 --> 00:22:21,649
some<font color="#E5E5E5"> people who have biases against LGBT</font>

489
00:22:21,649 --> 00:22:23,989
and sometimes<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's just an implicit</font>

490
00:22:23,989 --> 00:22:25,570
bias that they don't even know<font color="#CCCCCC"> about and</font>

491
00:22:25,570 --> 00:22:28,039
they're acknowledging that so they want

492
00:22:28,039 --> 00:22:31,729
<font color="#E5E5E5">to say okay you maybe have this implicit</font>

493
00:22:31,729 --> 00:22:33,799
bias explicit bias what we need<font color="#E5E5E5"> you to</font>

494
00:22:33,799 --> 00:22:36,889
<font color="#E5E5E5">do is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to push it aside and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> put the</font>

495
00:22:36,889 --> 00:22:38,149
patient first so I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you're</font>

496
00:22:38,149 --> 00:22:41,629
putting<font color="#CCCCCC"> the patient first then that's</font>

497
00:22:41,629 --> 00:22:44,029
that's the goal it doesn't matter you

498
00:22:44,029 --> 00:22:47,809
<font color="#E5E5E5">know how you feel about lgd LGBT people</font>

499
00:22:47,809 --> 00:22:51,200
in general your focus is<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay what is</font>

500
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:52,460
wrong<font color="#E5E5E5"> with this person what does this</font>

501
00:22:52,460 --> 00:22:56,509
person need how can i fix<font color="#E5E5E5"> it yeah I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> mean</font>

502
00:22:56,509 --> 00:22:58,339
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's a platonic ideal in medicine but</font>

503
00:22:58,339 --> 00:23:01,969
there's always medicine deals with these

504
00:23:01,969 --> 00:23:05,119
like very intimate issues um such as

505
00:23:05,119 --> 00:23:08,479
like when to prescribe medicine when to

506
00:23:08,479 --> 00:23:11,029
refer to<font color="#E5E5E5"> psychiatric issues and when to</font>

507
00:23:11,029 --> 00:23:14,570
talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> about things like sex and death huh</font>

508
00:23:14,570 --> 00:23:17,149
and when to address these with a patient

509
00:23:17,149 --> 00:23:20,690
and these<font color="#E5E5E5"> are really these are things</font>

510
00:23:20,690 --> 00:23:22,369
that hit close to home and sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of go</font>

511
00:23:22,369 --> 00:23:26,330
beyond the scope of like just bodily

512
00:23:26,330 --> 00:23:28,129
things and they they kind of cross over

513
00:23:28,129 --> 00:23:31,779
into belief systems a lot of the time so

514
00:23:31,779 --> 00:23:34,789
that's when I kind of wonder<font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font>

515
00:23:34,789 --> 00:23:38,210
whether or<font color="#E5E5E5"> not a patient would really be</font>

516
00:23:38,210 --> 00:23:40,429
able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to trust their doctor or their care</font>

517
00:23:40,429 --> 00:23:44,450
provider enough to like really believe

518
00:23:44,450 --> 00:23:46,279
that they're receiving the best care I

519
00:23:46,279 --> 00:23:48,200
mean as Josh mentioned with the lists

520
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:51,830
every patient has an every patient

521
00:23:51,830 --> 00:23:54,109
advocacy group has these secret lists I

522
00:23:54,109 --> 00:23:56,089
mean I<font color="#E5E5E5"> know that I've</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> been a part of a</font>

523
00:23:56,089 --> 00:23:57,649
couple<font color="#CCCCCC"> of groups and we have these</font>

524
00:23:57,649 --> 00:23:59,570
secret lists because you know who the

525
00:23:59,570 --> 00:24:00,739
good doctors are and<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know who the</font>

526
00:24:00,739 --> 00:24:04,820
bad doctors are um so<font color="#E5E5E5"> so in this</font>

527
00:24:04,820 --> 00:24:07,190
situation are<font color="#CCCCCC"> you so if you think that</font>

528
00:24:07,190 --> 00:24:08,739
you don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a good doctor I think if</font>

529
00:24:08,739 --> 00:24:11,659
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't trust your doctor that's the</font>

530
00:24:11,659 --> 00:24:13,580
problem<font color="#E5E5E5"> you need to find a doctor who</font>

531
00:24:13,580 --> 00:24:15,529
you trust and it's a hassle to find

532
00:24:15,529 --> 00:24:18,109
doctors in general not necessarily to

533
00:24:18,109 --> 00:24:19,870
find them but to find one<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

534
00:24:19,870 --> 00:24:21,730
works for<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and you feel really</font>

535
00:24:21,730 --> 00:24:24,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">comfortable with but I think just sort</font>

536
00:24:24,130 --> 00:24:26,800
of being very<font color="#CCCCCC"> clear</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> out in the open if</font>

537
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:29,130
someone's not asking you the question

538
00:24:29,130 --> 00:24:32,710
tell them see how you know feel them<font color="#E5E5E5"> out</font>

539
00:24:32,710 --> 00:24:35,860
for yourself and I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> I think what</font>

540
00:24:35,860 --> 00:24:37,150
you're doing is really<font color="#E5E5E5"> the right thing</font>

541
00:24:37,150 --> 00:24:39,940
these underground groups talking among

542
00:24:39,940 --> 00:24:43,809
people who are you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know like you and and</font>

543
00:24:43,809 --> 00:24:46,360
what do they<font color="#CCCCCC"> think and find</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the right</font>

544
00:24:46,360 --> 00:24:48,640
person so<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're I mean sure it can be</font>

545
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:50,260
hard to speak up and if you don't feel

546
00:24:50,260 --> 00:24:51,760
like you're gelling with that person I

547
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:55,000
mean medicine medicine is weird medicine

548
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:57,460
is the<font color="#CCCCCC"> only time in which you will walk</font>

549
00:24:57,460 --> 00:24:59,710
into a room meet a stranger and<font color="#CCCCCC"> they</font>

550
00:24:59,710 --> 00:25:00,940
will tell you to undress and you'll be

551
00:25:00,940 --> 00:25:05,380
like okay that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> fine so yep so I mean</font>

552
00:25:05,380 --> 00:25:07,090
it's important to to find someone that

553
00:25:07,090 --> 00:25:08,320
you're comfortable<font color="#CCCCCC"> with and if you're</font>

554
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:10,570
not comfortable get out go find someone

555
00:25:10,570 --> 00:25:12,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">else don't get out completely which is</font>

556
00:25:12,550 --> 00:25:15,160
one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the issues with why they're sort</font>

557
00:25:15,160 --> 00:25:17,429
of creating this pilot program is that

558
00:25:17,429 --> 00:25:21,190
LGBT folks are not<font color="#E5E5E5"> always going to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

559
00:25:21,190 --> 00:25:22,510
doctor if you have a bad experience you

560
00:25:22,510 --> 00:25:24,730
might not come back for a year so I

561
00:25:24,730 --> 00:25:27,309
think you know finding the<font color="#E5E5E5"> right person</font>

562
00:25:27,309 --> 00:25:30,190
talking<font color="#E5E5E5"> to your peers</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> helped who can</font>

563
00:25:30,190 --> 00:25:31,890
maybe help you find the right person

564
00:25:31,890 --> 00:25:34,420
that's important<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you're doing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

565
00:25:34,420 --> 00:25:37,510
right thing thank you the other article

566
00:25:37,510 --> 00:25:39,250
that I had<font color="#E5E5E5"> questions about was about</font>

567
00:25:39,250 --> 00:25:41,230
your article<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> right to die</font>

568
00:25:41,230 --> 00:25:45,790
legislation yep and as a person with a

569
00:25:45,790 --> 00:25:49,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">disability I'm wondering about the</font>

570
00:25:49,960 --> 00:25:51,940
greater restrictions on pain medications

571
00:25:51,940 --> 00:25:53,380
in our country that are<font color="#E5E5E5"> being pushed at</font>

572
00:25:53,380 --> 00:25:55,540
the same<font color="#E5E5E5"> time as the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> right to diet</font>

573
00:25:55,540 --> 00:25:59,770
legislation and it seems<font color="#E5E5E5"> to me and a lot</font>

574
00:25:59,770 --> 00:26:01,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">of other</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> people in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the disability rights</font>

575
00:26:01,240 --> 00:26:04,390
movement that this legislation is less

576
00:26:04,390 --> 00:26:08,230
about our quality of life than it is

577
00:26:08,230 --> 00:26:12,280
about controlling our bodies<font color="#CCCCCC"> hmm so I</font>

578
00:26:12,280 --> 00:26:15,370
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mean a lot of that legislation</font>

579
00:26:15,370 --> 00:26:18,880
is to<font color="#E5E5E5"> prevent sort of addiction to</font>

580
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:20,860
prescription painkillers correct is that

581
00:26:20,860 --> 00:26:23,080
what we're talking about kind of I mean

582
00:26:23,080 --> 00:26:25,120
<font color="#CCCCCC">kind of except you can't really</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> prevent</font>

583
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:27,760
addiction I mean addicts are going to

584
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:29,950
access medication any way that they can

585
00:26:29,950 --> 00:26:33,250
and really I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think they</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> don't</font>

586
00:26:33,250 --> 00:26:37,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">I mean I'll let you speak sorry I mean</font>

587
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:39,730
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> if</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we addressed things like</font>

588
00:26:39,730 --> 00:26:42,310
mandatory sentencing minimums we could

589
00:26:42,310 --> 00:26:44,200
sort of circumvent a lot of the issues

590
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:47,320
and right to die um and give patients

591
00:26:47,320 --> 00:26:51,460
more<font color="#E5E5E5"> bodily autonomy which is one of the</font>

592
00:26:51,460 --> 00:26:53,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">things that Brittany Menard talked about</font>

593
00:26:53,890 --> 00:26:56,740
repeatedly in her you know as<font color="#CCCCCC"> you wrote</font>

594
00:26:56,740 --> 00:27:01,690
very moving video but bodily autonomy is

595
00:27:01,690 --> 00:27:03,400
not something that right to die actually

596
00:27:03,400 --> 00:27:06,400
gives patients with disabilities so it's

597
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:09,340
definitely it's an interesting question

598
00:27:09,340 --> 00:27:12,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm not i hope</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i can answer it well</font>

599
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:13,780
enough actually one of the questions

600
00:27:13,780 --> 00:27:16,600
that I had from some Stanford doctors

601
00:27:16,600 --> 00:27:18,700
who were<font color="#E5E5E5"> sort of in the hospice world</font>

602
00:27:18,700 --> 00:27:22,060
was about this and one<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the things</font>

603
00:27:22,060 --> 00:27:24,220
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> they because in there a Stanford so</font>

604
00:27:24,220 --> 00:27:25,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">they're in California and they don't</font>

605
00:27:25,960 --> 00:27:27,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">have the right to die yet they don't</font>

606
00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:29,800
have this legislation it's something

607
00:27:29,800 --> 00:27:31,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">that I think they</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just reintroduced last</font>

608
00:27:31,750 --> 00:27:33,520
week or<font color="#E5E5E5"> the week before now times</font>

609
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:36,310
getting away from me<font color="#E5E5E5"> but they said that</font>

610
00:27:36,310 --> 00:27:39,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">when their patients in hospice</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

611
00:27:39,970 --> 00:27:42,820
end-of-life ask them about end-of-life

612
00:27:42,820 --> 00:27:46,270
care they<font color="#E5E5E5"> usually had an underlying</font>

613
00:27:46,270 --> 00:27:49,630
reason<font color="#CCCCCC"> for doing so their pain wasn't</font>

614
00:27:49,630 --> 00:27:53,500
being managed well there no one had

615
00:27:53,500 --> 00:27:55,480
talked to them about what dying might

616
00:27:55,480 --> 00:27:57,480
actually be like with their illness

617
00:27:57,480 --> 00:27:59,620
things like<font color="#E5E5E5"> that they just didn't know</font>

618
00:27:59,620 --> 00:28:01,630
they didn't feel like they had control

619
00:28:01,630 --> 00:28:02,920
day and feel like they had all the

620
00:28:02,920 --> 00:28:04,450
knowledge and they said once they

621
00:28:04,450 --> 00:28:06,280
started addressing those things their

622
00:28:06,280 --> 00:28:08,140
patients stopped asking for the right

623
00:28:08,140 --> 00:28:10,030
today I'm not<font color="#E5E5E5"> necessarily saying that</font>

624
00:28:10,030 --> 00:28:15,850
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not something that is you know it's</font>

625
00:28:15,850 --> 00:28:17,980
tough<font color="#CCCCCC"> but that was just sort of an</font>

626
00:28:17,980 --> 00:28:19,420
interesting thing I didn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> get to put in</font>

627
00:28:19,420 --> 00:28:21,120
the article at least I don't think I did

628
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:23,830
I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that those are things that come</font>

629
00:28:23,830 --> 00:28:25,600
<font color="#CCCCCC">up with intimacy in illness and the</font>

630
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:28,210
intimate nature of a doctor-patient

631
00:28:28,210 --> 00:28:30,700
relationship that I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that doctors</font>

632
00:28:30,700 --> 00:28:32,290
and patients need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to have and I think</font>

633
00:28:32,290 --> 00:28:34,240
that these are discussions that need to

634
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:35,950
happen early on in the diagnostic

635
00:28:35,950 --> 00:28:38,890
process and I also think that rather

636
00:28:38,890 --> 00:28:40,900
than fighting for right to die

637
00:28:40,900 --> 00:28:42,820
legislation right now we should<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

638
00:28:42,820 --> 00:28:46,450
fighting for access<font color="#CCCCCC"> to care across the</font>

639
00:28:46,450 --> 00:28:47,110
board as

640
00:28:47,110 --> 00:28:48,720
early as possible and access to

641
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:51,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">medication as early as possible and</font>

642
00:28:51,580 --> 00:28:55,420
access to<font color="#E5E5E5"> all</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of the care possible as</font>

643
00:28:55,420 --> 00:29:01,020
early<font color="#CCCCCC"> as possible and as I don't know as</font>

644
00:29:01,350 --> 00:29:05,160
economically viable as possible right

645
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:09,400
rather<font color="#E5E5E5"> than pushing us out right</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I mean</font>

646
00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:11,530
these are all very important things and

647
00:29:11,530 --> 00:29:14,230
I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's probably I mean right</font>

648
00:29:14,230 --> 00:29:16,360
today's definitely something that no one

649
00:29:16,360 --> 00:29:19,090
wants<font color="#E5E5E5"> to necessarily talk about until</font>

650
00:29:19,090 --> 00:29:21,730
you really get farther down that road

651
00:29:21,730 --> 00:29:23,799
because I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> there might be an a</font>

652
00:29:23,799 --> 00:29:26,080
night truth be told I don't know for

653
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:29,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">sure but you also don't want to scare a</font>

654
00:29:29,340 --> 00:29:31,929
patient I'm sure that there's an issue

655
00:29:31,929 --> 00:29:34,210
there as soon as they're diagnosed well

656
00:29:34,210 --> 00:29:38,230
you disagree I'm arias I mean I think

657
00:29:38,230 --> 00:29:39,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">that it is something that you have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

658
00:29:39,580 --> 00:29:41,260
start talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> as soon as you can</font>

659
00:29:41,260 --> 00:29:43,090
and I think you have to start<font color="#E5E5E5"> talking</font>

660
00:29:43,090 --> 00:29:45,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">about end-of-life options I've been in</font>

661
00:29:45,250 --> 00:29:46,990
hospital situations where they've talked

662
00:29:46,990 --> 00:29:49,540
to me about dying in a ham-fisted way

663
00:29:49,540 --> 00:29:51,070
and they haven't been doctors that I've

664
00:29:51,070 --> 00:29:53,440
seen<font color="#E5E5E5"> before they've been new doctors and</font>

665
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:55,419
they've<font color="#CCCCCC"> just talked to me about okay</font>

666
00:29:55,419 --> 00:29:57,190
well you should start considering this

667
00:29:57,190 --> 00:29:58,900
your quality of life is going to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font>

668
00:29:58,900 --> 00:30:01,000
awful and they've just<font color="#E5E5E5"> told me these</font>

669
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:03,040
things and if I wasn't an advocate<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

670
00:30:03,040 --> 00:30:05,710
if I<font color="#E5E5E5"> wasn't as informed as I was and if</font>

671
00:30:05,710 --> 00:30:11,200
I if I wasn't me basically I would be a

672
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:14,080
lot more depressed I would be devastated

673
00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:19,690
by the things I was<font color="#E5E5E5"> being told and it's</font>

674
00:30:19,690 --> 00:30:21,940
just not the way it<font color="#CCCCCC"> should be done you</font>

675
00:30:21,940 --> 00:30:24,010
should really have these conversations

676
00:30:24,010 --> 00:30:27,090
with<font color="#E5E5E5"> your doctor's earlier and there</font>

677
00:30:27,090 --> 00:30:30,330
there should<font color="#E5E5E5"> be trust in intimacy</font>

678
00:30:30,330 --> 00:30:33,540
between doctors and patients mm-hmm

679
00:30:33,540 --> 00:30:36,990
that's it yeah no I<font color="#CCCCCC"> mean that's a good</font>

680
00:30:36,990 --> 00:30:40,600
<font color="#CCCCCC">point and your experiences is very</font>

681
00:30:40,600 --> 00:30:43,059
<font color="#CCCCCC">valuable and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I think probably for this</font>

682
00:30:43,059 --> 00:30:45,490
particular issue contributes more than I

683
00:30:45,490 --> 00:30:47,290
do to the show so thank you<font color="#E5E5E5"> for sharing</font>

684
00:30:47,290 --> 00:30:51,910
it with us thank you yeah all right

685
00:30:51,910 --> 00:30:53,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">thank you very</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> much was a very</font>

686
00:30:53,350 --> 00:30:55,510
enlightening an important topic to talk

687
00:30:55,510 --> 00:30:57,880
about why don't we say thank you<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

688
00:30:57,880 --> 00:30:59,120
everyone watching at home

689
00:30:59,120 --> 00:31:02,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay um thanks so much to everybody</font>

690
00:31:02,510 --> 00:31:04,610
watching I'm Sydney<font color="#CCCCCC"> lufkin health</font>

691
00:31:04,610 --> 00:31:06,559
reporter at vice news and this was on

692
00:31:06,559 --> 00:31:08,809
<font color="#CCCCCC">the line thank you you need to</font>

693
00:31:08,809 --> 00:31:10,250
understand that people are coming in

694
00:31:10,250 --> 00:31:13,640
begging for this drug and they know they

695
00:31:13,640 --> 00:31:15,980
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to take it every day and so they do</font>

696
00:31:15,980 --> 00:31:19,100
I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> we could be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> sitting on something</font>

697
00:31:19,100 --> 00:31:20,390
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> could change the course of this</font>

698
00:31:20,390 --> 00:31:22,700
epidemic I think it remains to be seen

699
00:31:22,700 --> 00:00:00,000
how well we can make prep available
