SOUTH KOREA.
WHAT'S BEEN REACTION FROM
GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS THERE TO
THE SUMMIT.
HELLO.
>> Reporter: HELLO.
THE OFFICIAL WORLD WE'RE SEEING
FROM THE SOUTH KOREAN'S
PRESIDENT'S OFFICE IS HEARTFELT
AND GLOWING AND THEY DESCRIBE IT
AS AN HISTORIC EVENT.
SOUTH KOREAN PRESIDENT MOON HAD
A LOT TO DO TO THE RUN-UP TO
THIS DIPLOMATIC MEETING AND
THERE WAS SOME GRUMBLINGS
DISRUPTING MILITARY EXERCISES
AND WE GET GET INDICATION FROM
THE GOVERNMENT THEY DIDN'T HAVE
TOO MUCH ADVANCED WORD ON THIS
AND STRESSED THE IMPORTANCE OF
THE DRILLS FROM A SYMBOLIC AND
PRACTICAL NATURE AND HOPEFULLY
IT'S NOT SET IN STONE.
THE OTHER CONCERN FROM EXPERTS
REGARDING THE OUTCOME OF THE
SUMMIT NOT TOO MUCH ADVANCEMENT
REGARDING DENUCLEARIZATION
EXCEPT FOR THE DESTRUCTION OF
THE ONE TEST SITE WE REPORTED.
AND NO WORD ON MOVEMENT TOWARDS
THE END OF THE KOREAN WAR.
ONE POSITIVE NOTE THOUGH COMING
OUT OF THIS, THOUGH, THE WORD
FROM NORTH KOREA IT WILL ASSIST
IN RECOVERY OF REMAINS FROM
SOLDIERS 7,700 STILL REMAIN
UNACCOUNTED FOR 65 YEARS LATER.
>> Bill: I WONDER WHAT THE
PEOPLE THINK THERE.
REACTION THERE.
>> Reporter: WE WENT OUT TO THE
SEOUL VERSION OF GRAND CENTRAL
STATION AND PEOPLE WERE GLUED TO
THE TV SCREENS WATCHING
PRESIDENT TRUMP AND KIM JONG-UN
EMERGE AND SHAKE HANDS AND THERE
WAS APPLAUSE.
ONE PERSON SAID IT'S BETTER TO
BE FACE TO FACE THAN ON PHONES
OR PAPER OR WAR.
WE HEARD FROM ANOTHER INDIVIDUAL
HE SAID THAT COMMUNICATION IS
KEY.
WE HEARD FROM A YOUNG LADY AND
SHE HAD A SIMPLE MESSAGE.
I WANT PEACE ON THE KOREAN
PENINSULA.
I CAN TELL YOU, BILL, OUR TEAM
HAS BEEN HERE MULTIPLE OCCASIONS
IN THE PAST FEW MONTHS AND WE'VE
BEEN CLOSER TO NUCLEAR WAR THAN
PEACE.
