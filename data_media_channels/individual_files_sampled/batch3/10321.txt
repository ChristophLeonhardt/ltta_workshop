Germany slammed President Trump's new trade tariffs on the EU saying that damaging the economy the US has already course increased rates on steel and at a million for Europe and for its key NATO ally Turkey we won't let Washington dictate to us with whom we can do business this trade war is slowing down and destroying economic growth and creating new uncertainties to say cat among the pigeons is rather understate but let's get live tour Europe correspondent Peter Pollock Oliver get the view from Central Europe there Germany is it heading for a full-blown trade war here with Trump or what are the thoughts well what we've heard from Peter altmire there the economy minister ISM saying in no way will Europe be dictator - or Germany be dictated to by the United States over who they can do business with now this goes back to the announcement last week by Donald Trump where he said that anyone that does business with Iran won't be doing business with the United States that in turn was in relation to Donald Trump's decision to pull the United States out of the 2015 Iran nuclear deal and everything that came with that regarding trade now what that would mean ultimately would be European giants like the the oil company total also car manufacturers like Renault and Daimler who are currently operating in Iran that they would be denied access to the United States market something that would be unthinkable what we've heard from mr. Altmire there is a statement saying look this can't go on we don't want to see this type of trade war escalate and the fact that we're hearing it from mr. Altmire should be taken is that this is the words coming from Angela Merkel the German Chancellor is never one to come forward with a statement unless she really has to and if we look back on pizza out Meyers previous experience between 2013 to to 2018 he was referred to essentially is the most powerful man in Berlin he was the head of the Chancellery so if he's saying it we can pretty much guaranteed an angle and Merkel is thinking that as well and they aren't alone in Europe about being worried over what a trade war could bring this is a birthday for the world Twitter's totally unacceptable using the message carry the threats of a spiral of escalation that will result in damaging everyone nobody wins in a trade war there are only casualties European response will be United and firm well in this interview that Peter altmire gave to one of the big Sunday newspapers here in Germany he did also praised the deal that had been done in July between jean-claude Juncker and Donald Trump for a trade deal between the EU and and the United States as well but still very much the the warning signal signals on for what a potential trade war could bring and it's not just Europe that is feeling the pinch of sanctions are sorry I beg your pardon of air tariffs from the United States Turkey as well has been hit with a well a huge increase on tariffs of exporting its metals to the US 20% on aluminium 50% on steel that it exports to the United States this is after Turkey didn't meet a deadline that was set last Wednesday by Washington to release a United States citizen who's also a pastor who's being detained in Turkey now Donald Trump calls the charges against this man bogus the Turkish side say that he has links to the the banned Kurdish Workers Party knee also has ties to the attempted coup that tried to overthrow President Erdogan back in 2016 now President Erdogan for his side says that if these type of tariffs keep being put in place then Turkey may look elsewhere for its allies we will respond to the one declaring a war of trade to the whole world by aiming at new markets finding new corporations and allies but if this trade war deepens that dollar trade war that Donald Trump has been threatening the world with if this deepens well that is essentially kryptonite to business a creates uncertainty and uncertainty does no good for anybody's economy anywhere in the world mr. reale vicious circle isn't as you just sayin Pete thanks the update for now you
