1
00:00:08,780 --> 00:00:10,549
>> Neil: NANCY PELOSI IS

2
00:00:10,549 --> 00:00:12,250
POO-POOED THE LATEST NUMBER.

3
00:00:12,250 --> 00:00:14,052
THE HEADLINES COULDN'T FIND

4
00:00:14,052 --> 00:00:15,554
ENOUGH WORDS TO PRAISE IT.

5
00:00:15,554 --> 00:00:17,222
IT'S DOING TOO LITTLE TO THE

6
00:00:17,222 --> 00:00:18,790
FAMILIES HIT WITH SOARING NEW

7
00:00:18,790 --> 00:00:20,625
COSTS UNDER THE REPUBLICAN'S

8
00:00:20,625 --> 00:00:21,059
WATCH.

9
00:00:21,059 --> 00:00:22,494
WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THAT?

10
00:00:22,494 --> 00:00:25,163
>> I THINK IT'S JUST ABSURD.

11
00:00:25,163 --> 00:00:26,932
THE DEMOCRATS, NANCY'S REACHING

12
00:00:26,932 --> 00:00:27,265
THERE.

13
00:00:27,265 --> 00:00:28,333
THE DEMOCRATS WILL HAVE THEIR

14
00:00:28,333 --> 00:00:28,900
TALKING POINTS.

15
00:00:28,900 --> 00:00:31,036
THEY DON'T HAVE AN ALTERNATIVE.

16
00:00:31,036 --> 00:00:33,905
SO THEY PIVOT OFF TO IDENTITY

17
00:00:33,905 --> 00:00:35,040
POLITICS, NEGATIVE STUFF.

18
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:36,675
THEY DON'T HAVE A ECONOMIC PLAN.

19
00:00:36,675 --> 00:00:37,509
THEY NEVER HAVE.

20
00:00:37,509 --> 00:00:40,879
THEY CAN'T TELL YOU WHAT CAUSES

21
00:00:40,879 --> 00:00:43,248
ECONOMIC GROWTH.

22
00:00:43,248 --> 00:00:47,485
>> Neil: NOT A FOX NEWS ALERT TO

23
00:00:47,485 --> 00:00:49,321
SAYING THE BLUE WAVE MIGHT NOT

24
00:00:49,321 --> 00:00:50,889
BE THE WAVE THAT DEMOCRATS

25
00:00:50,889 --> 00:00:53,625
ENVISIONED OR THEY HAVE A REMOTE

26
00:00:53,625 --> 00:00:55,327
CHANCE OF TAKING OVER THE HOUSE

27
00:00:55,327 --> 00:00:57,062
LET ALONE OF GAINING IN THE

28
00:00:57,062 --> 00:00:58,763
SENATE.

29
00:00:58,763 --> 00:00:59,931
NEITHER WILL HAPPEN BECAUSE THE

30
00:00:59,931 --> 00:01:04,836
ECONOMY IS ON FIRE AND WE MIGHT

31
00:01:04,970 --> 00:01:07,606
THE COUNTRY INCLUDING

32
00:01:07,606 --> 00:01:08,006
CALIFORNIA.

33
00:01:08,006 --> 00:01:09,074
THAT'S WHERE YOU'LL FIND PETER

34
00:01:09,074 --> 00:01:10,976
DOOCY WITH THE LATEST.

35
00:01:10,976 --> 00:01:12,277
HEY, PETER.

36
00:01:12,277 --> 00:01:14,212
>> NEIL, ALL THAT A CANDIDATE

37
00:01:14,212 --> 00:01:16,748
HAS TO DO IS TO ADVANCE OUT IS

38
00:01:16,748 --> 00:01:18,550
FINISH FIRST OR SECOND PLACE IN

39
00:01:18,550 --> 00:01:19,651
THEIR DISTRICT REGARDLESS OF

40
00:01:19,651 --> 00:01:21,319
THEIR POLITICAL PARTY.

41
00:01:21,319 --> 00:01:23,021
THERE ARE SO MANY DEMOCRATS

42
00:01:23,021 --> 00:01:25,890
RUNNING IN SOME OF THESE

43
00:01:25,890 --> 00:01:28,793
DISTRICTS THAT THEIR SUPPORT MAY

44
00:01:28,793 --> 00:01:30,462
BE WATERED DOWN AND THE

45
00:01:30,462 --> 00:01:32,364
REPUBLICANS MAY GET THE TOP TWO

46
00:01:32,364 --> 00:01:32,697
SPOTS.

47
00:01:32,697 --> 00:01:35,133
SO ONE DEMOCRAT NOW TRYING TO

48
00:01:35,133 --> 00:01:38,169
CONSOLIDATE SUPPORT IS HARLEY

49
00:01:38,169 --> 00:01:38,470
RUDA.

50
00:01:38,470 --> 00:01:40,271
>> OUR GOAL IS TO CONTINUE TO

51
00:01:40,271 --> 00:01:41,973
COMMUNICATE TO THE VOTER WHY WE

52
00:01:41,973 --> 00:01:43,942
ARE THE BEST CHOICE, KNOCKING ON

53
00:01:43,942 --> 00:01:47,912
DOORS, PHONE BANKING, DOING THE

54
00:01:47,912 --> 00:01:49,280
THINGS THAT SUCCESSFUL CAMPAIGNS

55
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:49,547
DO.

56
00:01:49,547 --> 00:01:51,883
IF WE DO IT AND OFTEN, WE'LL BE

57
00:01:51,883 --> 00:01:53,351
ONE OF THOSE TWO CANDIDATES THAT

58
00:01:53,351 --> 00:01:55,086
MOVES FORWARD TO THE GENERAL.

59
00:01:55,086 --> 00:01:58,723
>> IF HE DOESN'T FINISH IN THE

60
00:01:58,723 --> 00:02:04,229
TOP TWO, SCOTT BAUGH MAY BE THE

61
00:02:04,229 --> 00:02:05,997
SECOND REPUBLICAN ON THE BALL

62
00:02:05,997 --> 00:02:08,066
LOT, WHICH WOULD REALLY HURT

63
00:02:08,066 --> 00:02:10,068
NANCY PELOSI'S PLAN TO FLIP THE

64
00:02:10,068 --> 00:02:10,368
HOUSE.

65
00:02:10,368 --> 00:02:11,970
>> THE MORE SEATS YOU TAKE OFF

66
00:02:11,970 --> 00:02:13,705
THE TABLE, THE MORE SHE HAS TO

67
00:02:13,705 --> 00:02:17,108
RAN EVERY CAMPAIGN PERFECTLY.

68
00:02:17,108 --> 00:02:19,210
WE KNOW THAT'S NOT HAPPENING.

69
00:02:19,210 --> 00:02:22,514
>> IN TERMS OF CAMPAIGN ISSUES,

70
00:02:22,514 --> 00:02:24,916
REPUBLICANS ARE TRYING TO KEEP

71
00:02:24,916 --> 00:02:26,084
RETIRING REPUBLICAN DARRELL

72
00:02:26,084 --> 00:02:28,586
ISSA'S SEAT WITH AN AGENDA THAT

73
00:02:28,586 --> 00:02:29,954
MIRROR'S PRESIDENT TRUMP'S.

74
00:02:29,954 --> 00:02:33,658
>> TAXES ARE HUGE.

75
00:02:33,658 --> 00:02:35,760
SO IS THE SANCTUARY STATE, THE

76
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:38,730
CATCH AND RELEASE.

77
00:02:38,730 --> 00:02:40,799
EVERYTHING HAPPENED OUT OF

78
00:02:40,799 --> 00:02:42,100
SACRAMENTO IS HITTING HARD.

79
00:02:42,100 --> 00:02:44,636
ALL THE DEMOCRATS HAVE IS

80
00:02:44,636 --> 00:02:44,969
RESIST.

81
00:02:44,969 --> 00:02:45,937
>> DEMOCRATS IN THAT DISTRICT

82
00:02:45,937 --> 00:02:47,372
THINK THAT THEY HAVE GOT THE

83
00:02:47,372 --> 00:02:47,939
UPPER HAND.

84
00:02:47,939 --> 00:02:51,776
ONE OF THE TOP DEMOCRATIC

85
00:02:51,776 --> 00:02:53,912
CONTENDERS MIKE LEVIN SAYS HE

86
00:02:53,912 --> 00:02:56,781
THINKS HE CAN CLEAN UP THE

87
00:02:56,781 --> 00:02:58,149
SAN DIEGO COASTLINE THAN DARRELL

88
00:02:58,149 --> 00:03:01,052
ISSA WAS ABLE TO AS THE REP.

89
00:03:01,052 --> 00:03:01,453
NEIL?

90
00:03:01,453 --> 00:03:02,954
>> Neil: THANKS.

91
00:03:02,954 --> 00:03:06,791
LET'S GO TO TOM BEVIN FROM REAL

92
00:03:06,791 --> 00:03:07,525
CLEAR POLITICS.

93
00:03:07,525 --> 00:03:10,628
THE BLUE WAVE WAS THE CONSENSUS

94
00:03:10,628 --> 00:03:10,995
OPINION.

95
00:03:10,995 --> 00:03:13,031
NOW IMPROVING ECONOMIC NUMBERS,

96
00:03:13,031 --> 00:03:13,932
THE EMPLOYMENT REPORT AND

97
00:03:13,932 --> 00:03:15,734
GROWING PERCEPTIONS ON THE PART

98
00:03:15,734 --> 00:03:18,536
OF MANY AMERICANS THAT WELL,

99
00:03:18,536 --> 00:03:19,671
MAYBE KEEPING REPUBLICANS IN

100
00:03:19,671 --> 00:03:20,939
CHARGE OF CONGRESS IS NOT A BAD

101
00:03:20,939 --> 00:03:21,239
IDEA.

102
00:03:21,239 --> 00:03:23,341
THAT TOO CAN CHANGE.

103
00:03:23,341 --> 00:03:24,709
WHAT IS GOING ON HERE?

104
00:03:24,709 --> 00:03:27,979
>> WELL, YOU'RE RIGHT, NEIL.

105
00:03:27,979 --> 00:03:29,114
IF THE COMMIT, THE PRESIDENT'S

106
00:03:29,114 --> 00:03:33,518
JOB APPROVAL IS UP, THE GENERIC

107
00:03:33,518 --> 00:03:37,088
BALLOT HAS BEEN SLIDING FOR THE

108
00:03:37,088 --> 00:03:37,455
DEMOCRATS.

109
00:03:37,455 --> 00:03:40,358
THINGS ARE LOOKING BETTER FOR

110
00:03:40,358 --> 00:03:41,326
REPUBLICANS THAN THEY WERE A FEW

111
00:03:41,326 --> 00:03:42,127
WEEKS AGO.

112
00:03:42,127 --> 00:03:43,194
PETER IS RIGHT.

113
00:03:43,194 --> 00:03:44,162
FOR HOUSE DEMOCRATS IN

114
00:03:44,162 --> 00:03:45,864
PARTICULAR, SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA

115
00:03:45,864 --> 00:03:47,232
IS THE KEY.

116
00:03:47,232 --> 00:03:49,667
THERE'S SEVEN DISTRICTS IN THE

117
00:03:49,667 --> 00:03:52,303
STATE OF CALIFORNIA THAT HILLARY

118
00:03:52,303 --> 00:03:54,339
CLINTON WON IN 2016.

119
00:03:54,339 --> 00:03:55,807
THEY'RE TARGETING THE THREE IN

120
00:03:55,807 --> 00:03:57,809
SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA IN

121
00:03:57,809 --> 00:03:58,376
PARTICULAR.

122
00:03:58,376 --> 00:04:00,078
IF THEY GET SHUTOUT OF THOSE

123
00:04:00,078 --> 00:04:02,647
RACES IN NOVEMBER, THAT WILL BE

124
00:04:02,647 --> 00:04:05,650
A SIGNIFICANT BLOW OF

125
00:04:05,650 --> 00:04:06,951
RECAPTURING HOUSE OF

126
00:04:06,951 --> 00:04:07,452
REPRESENTATIVES.

127
00:04:07,452 --> 00:04:08,119
>> Neil: WHAT I DON'T

128
00:04:08,119 --> 00:04:09,954
UNDERSTAND, PEOPLE HAVE BEEN

129
00:04:09,954 --> 00:04:11,923
EXPLAINING TO ME, THIS NEW

130
00:04:11,923 --> 00:04:13,491
PROCEDURE THAT STARTED UNDER

131
00:04:13,491 --> 00:04:14,993
ARNOLD SCHWARZENEGGER THAT THEY

132
00:04:14,993 --> 00:04:16,961
WOULD ALLOW THE TOP TWO

133
00:04:16,961 --> 00:04:19,798
FINISHERS TO BE THE WINNERS IN A

134
00:04:19,798 --> 00:04:21,366
PRIMARY BATTLE SO OPEN TO BOTH

135
00:04:21,366 --> 00:04:23,968
SIDES, SEE HOW IT GOES, IT WAS

136
00:04:23,968 --> 00:04:25,236
SUPPOSED TO INCREASE A

137
00:04:25,236 --> 00:04:28,439
MODERATION IN POLITICS, THAT

138
00:04:28,439 --> 00:04:29,674
MODERATES WOULD WIN AND NOT

139
00:04:29,674 --> 00:04:31,209
NECESSARILY A BAD THING AND THAT

140
00:04:31,209 --> 00:04:34,112
DEMOCRATS ARE SALIVATING AT THE

141
00:04:34,112 --> 00:04:37,949
PROSPECT THAT IT WOULD BE GOOD

142
00:04:37,949 --> 00:04:41,386
FOR THEM.

143
00:04:41,386 --> 00:04:42,987
UNFORTUNATELY TOO MANY DEMOCRATS

144
00:04:42,987 --> 00:04:44,756
ENTERED AND COULD BE DIVIDING

145
00:04:44,756 --> 00:04:45,156
THE VOTE.

146
00:04:45,156 --> 00:04:46,224
>> YEAH.

147
00:04:46,224 --> 00:04:49,994
IT'S BEST OF INTENTION BUT

148
00:04:49,994 --> 00:04:51,296
UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES.

149
00:04:51,296 --> 00:04:53,998
DEMOCRATS THOUGHT THIS WOULD

150
00:04:53,998 --> 00:04:56,734
GIVE US A HAND WHERE THERE'S

151
00:04:56,734 --> 00:04:59,904
MORE DEMOCRATS THAN REPUBLICANS.

152
00:04:59,904 --> 00:05:02,273
THERE'S SO MANY DEMOCRATS EAGER

153
00:05:02,273 --> 00:05:04,909
TO RUN, PASSIONATE ABOUT

154
00:05:04,909 --> 00:05:05,777
RESISTANCE, WANT TO FIGHT

155
00:05:05,777 --> 00:05:07,178
AGAINST TRUMP, ET CETERA.

156
00:05:07,178 --> 00:05:09,180
YOU FOUND IN A FEW DISTRICTS THE

157
00:05:09,180 --> 00:05:10,381
PARTIES HAD A TOUGH TIME TRYING

158
00:05:10,381 --> 00:05:11,082
TO CONTROL THEM.

159
00:05:11,082 --> 00:05:12,784
NOBODY WILL DROP OUT.

160
00:05:12,784 --> 00:05:14,652
THEY'RE FIGHTING TOOTH AND NAIL.

161
00:05:14,652 --> 00:05:16,321
IT IS SPLITTING THE VOTE,

162
00:05:16,321 --> 00:05:19,224
CAUSING THEM BIG TIME PROBLEMS.

163
00:05:19,224 --> 00:05:21,292
AGAIN, IF THEY CAN SHUTOUT ONE,

164
00:05:21,292 --> 00:05:23,094
TWO OR ALL THREE RACES, IT'S

165
00:05:23,094 --> 00:05:25,230
GOING TO BE A SERIOUS PROBLEM

166
00:05:25,230 --> 00:05:26,097
FOR THEM COME NOVEMBER.

167
00:05:26,097 --> 00:05:28,366
>> Neil: AREN'T THE ONES ANGRY

168
00:05:28,366 --> 00:05:30,668
THE MORE LIKELY TO GET TO THE

169
00:05:30,668 --> 00:05:32,070
POLES AND THOSE SATISFIED WITH

170
00:05:32,070 --> 00:05:33,304
THE ECONOMY, THE MARKETS OR BOTH

171
00:05:33,304 --> 00:05:34,239
LESS LIKELY?

172
00:05:34,239 --> 00:05:36,474
ISN'T THAT THE CLASSIC RULE OF

173
00:05:36,474 --> 00:05:36,774
THUMB?

174
00:05:36,774 --> 00:05:37,976
>> Neil: WELL, LOOK, I THINK

175
00:05:37,976 --> 00:05:39,577
THAT -- YOU BRING UP A GREAT

176
00:05:39,577 --> 00:05:41,045
POINT, WHICH IS FOR REPUBLICANS,

177
00:05:41,045 --> 00:05:42,413
THE GOOD ECONOMY IS A DOUBLE

178
00:05:42,413 --> 00:05:42,981
EDGE SORT.

179
00:05:42,981 --> 00:05:46,117
THE BETTER IT IS, THE MORE

180
00:05:46,117 --> 00:05:47,886
PEOPLE WORE PRY ABOUT OTHER

181
00:05:47,886 --> 00:05:49,087
THINGS, HEALTHCARE, EDUCATION.

182
00:05:49,087 --> 00:05:50,955
COULD BE A DRAG ON THEM.

183
00:05:50,955 --> 00:05:52,490
DEMOCRATS HAVE BEEN ENERGIZED

184
00:05:52,490 --> 00:05:52,991
THIS YEAR.

185
00:05:52,991 --> 00:05:56,594
BUT AGAIN, WHEN YOU HAVE SO MANY

186
00:05:56,594 --> 00:05:58,563
COMPETITIVE CANDIDATES IN THESE

187
00:05:58,563 --> 00:06:03,801
SEATS, YOU KNOW, DILUTING THE

188
00:06:03,801 --> 00:06:05,603
VOTE, SPLITTING THE VOTE.

189
00:06:05,603 --> 00:06:07,071
IN NOVEMBER, IT'S ABOUT TURNING

190
