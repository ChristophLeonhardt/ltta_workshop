1
00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:03,550
There’s a two-letter word that we hear everywhere.

2
00:00:03,550 --> 00:00:04,720
OK.

3
00:00:04,720 --> 00:00:06,820
Okay.

4
00:00:06,920 --> 00:00:08,880
OK, are you OK Annie?

5
00:00:08,900 --> 00:00:11,460
OK OK OK, OK ladies…

6
00:00:11,460 --> 00:00:14,440
OK might be the most recognizable word on
the planet.

7
00:00:14,450 --> 00:00:15,450
OK!

8
00:00:15,450 --> 00:00:16,450
OK.

9
00:00:16,450 --> 00:00:20,280
It’s essential to how we communicate with
each other, and even with our technology.

10
00:00:20,280 --> 00:00:23,240
Alexa, turn off the living room light.

11
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:24,240
OK.

12
00:00:24,680 --> 00:00:27,450
You probably use it every day – even if
you don’t notice it.

13
00:00:27,450 --> 00:00:30,369
But, what does OK actually mean?

14
00:00:30,369 --> 00:00:32,079
And where did it come from?

15
00:00:32,540 --> 00:00:33,079
Hm.

16
00:00:33,079 --> 00:00:34,079
OK.

17
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:35,079
Okay then.

18
00:00:35,079 --> 00:00:36,979
OK, thank you.

19
00:00:36,979 --> 00:00:42,510
OK actually traces back to an 1830s fad of
intentionally misspelling abbreviations.

20
00:00:42,510 --> 00:00:47,210
Young “intellectual” types in Boston delighted
those “in the know” with butchered coded

21
00:00:47,210 --> 00:00:55,429
messages such as KC, or “knuff ced”, KY,
“know yuse,” and OW, “oll wright.”

22
00:00:55,429 --> 00:00:56,429
Haha.

23
00:00:56,429 --> 00:01:03,660
But thanks to a couple of lucky breaks, one
abbreviation rose above the rest: OK, or “oll korrect."

24
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:08,140
In the early 1800s, “all correct” was
a common phrase used to confirm that everything

25
00:01:08,140 --> 00:01:09,260
was in order.

26
00:01:09,260 --> 00:01:16,030
Its abbreviated cousin started going mainstream
on March 23, 1839, when OK was first published

27
00:01:16,030 --> 00:01:17,750
in the Boston Morning Post.

28
00:01:17,750 --> 00:01:22,610
Soon other papers picked up on the joke and
spread it around the country, until OK was

29
00:01:22,610 --> 00:01:26,820
something everyone knew about, not just a
few Boston insiders.

30
00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:31,880
And OK’s newfound popularity even prompted
a flailing US president from Kinderhook, New York,

31
00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:35,700
to adopt it as a nickname during his
1840 reelection campaign.

32
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:40,780
Van Buren’s supporters formed OK Clubs all
over the country, and their message was pretty

33
00:01:40,780 --> 00:01:43,690
clear: Old Kinderhook was “oll korrect.”

34
00:01:43,690 --> 00:01:47,630
The campaign was highly publicized and turned
pretty nasty in the press.

35
00:01:47,630 --> 00:01:51,380
His opponents ended up turning the abbreviation
around on him, saying it stood for “Orful

36
00:01:51,380 --> 00:01:53,900
Konspiracy” or “Orful Katastrophe”

37
00:01:55,140 --> 00:01:55,640
Hah.

38
00:01:56,120 --> 00:02:00,120
In the end, even a clever nickname didn’t
save Van Buren’s presidency.

39
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:01,850
But it was a win for OK.

40
00:02:01,850 --> 00:02:06,550
That 1840 presidential campaign firmly established
OK in the American vernacular.

41
00:02:06,550 --> 00:02:10,959
And while similar abbreviations fell out of
fashion, OK made the crossover from slang

42
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:16,220
into legitimate, functional use thanks to
one invention: the telegraph.

43
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:20,400
If we lower the bridge, the current flows
to the sounder.

44
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:24,620
At the other end, the current energizes an
electromagnet and this attracts the armature.

45
00:02:24,620 --> 00:02:27,760
The armature clicks down against a screw and
taps out a message.

46
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:32,450
The telegraph debuted in 1844, just five years
after OK.

47
00:02:32,450 --> 00:02:37,610
It transmitted short messages in the form
of electric pulses, with combinations of dots

48
00:02:37,610 --> 00:02:41,550
and dashes representing letters of the alphabet.

49
00:02:41,550 --> 00:02:43,420
This was OK’s moment to shine.

50
00:02:43,420 --> 00:02:47,780
The two letters were easy to tap out and very
unlikely to be confused with anything else.

51
00:02:47,780 --> 00:02:52,409
It was quickly adopted as a standard acknowledgement
of a transmission received, especially by

52
00:02:52,409 --> 00:02:54,980
operators on the expanding US railroad.

53
00:02:54,980 --> 00:02:59,969
This telegraphic manual from 1865 even goes
as far as to say that “no message is ever

54
00:02:59,969 --> 00:03:04,190
regarded as transmitted until the office receiving
it gives O K.”

55
00:03:04,190 --> 00:03:06,020
OK had become serious business.

56
00:03:06,020 --> 00:03:09,739
But there’s another big reason the two letters
stuck around, and it’s not just because

57
00:03:09,740 --> 00:03:10,900
they’re easy to communicate.

58
00:03:10,900 --> 00:03:12,969
It has to do with how OK looks.

59
00:03:12,969 --> 00:03:16,769
Or more specifically, how the letter K looks
and sounds.

60
00:03:16,769 --> 00:03:20,939
It’s really uncommon to start a word with
the letter K in English — it’s ranked

61
00:03:20,939 --> 00:03:23,080
around 22nd in the alphabet.

62
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:27,239
That rarity spurred a “Kraze for K” at
the turn of the century in advertising and

63
00:03:27,239 --> 00:03:32,299
print, where companies replaced hard Cs with
Ks in order to Katch your eye.

64
00:03:32,299 --> 00:03:37,419
The idea was that modifying a word — like
Klearflax Linen Rugs or this Kook-Rite Stove,

65
00:03:37,419 --> 00:03:40,310
for example — would draw more attention
to it.

66
00:03:40,310 --> 00:03:45,169
And that’s still a visual strategy: We see
K represented in modern corporate logos, like

67
00:03:45,169 --> 00:03:47,160
Krispy-Kreme and Kool-Aid.

68
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:49,980
It’s the K that makes it so memorable.

69
00:03:49,989 --> 00:03:55,400
By the 1890s, OK’s Bostonian origins were
already mostly forgotten, and newspapers began

70
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:59,749
to debate its history — often perpetuating
myths in the process that some people still

71
00:03:59,749 --> 00:04:00,749
believe.

72
00:04:00,749 --> 00:04:05,050
Like the claim that it comes from the Choctaw
word ‘okeh,’ which means ‘so it is.’

73
00:04:05,050 --> 00:04:07,769
Choctaw gave us the word OK…

74
00:04:07,769 --> 00:04:12,340
OK’s beginnings had become obscure but it
didn’t really matter anymore — the word

75
00:04:12,340 --> 00:04:13,950
was embedded in our language.

76
00:04:13,950 --> 00:04:17,310
Today, we use it as the ultimate “neutral
affirmative.”

77
00:04:17,310 --> 00:04:18,310
OK then.

78
00:04:18,310 --> 00:04:19,500
Okay then.

79
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:21,070
Learn to truly love yourself.

80
00:04:21,070 --> 00:04:22,070
OK.

81
00:04:22,070 --> 00:04:22,560
OK.

82
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:23,560
Get yourself up here!

83
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:24,760
OK!

84
00:04:25,060 --> 00:04:27,160
I don’t know what to say.

85
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:28,600
Say OK.

86
00:04:30,660 --> 00:04:31,160
OK.

87
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:33,030
It’s settled then!

88
00:04:33,030 --> 00:04:37,910
Allan Metcalf wrote the definitive history
of OK, and he explains that the word “affirms

89
00:04:37,910 --> 00:04:41,730
without evaluating,” meaning it doesn’t
convey any feelings — it just acknowledges

90
00:04:41,730 --> 00:04:42,960
and accepts information.

91
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:46,080
If you “got home OK,” it just means you
were unharmed.

92
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:49,670
If your “food was OK,” then it was acceptable.

93
00:04:49,670 --> 00:04:51,610
And “OK” confirms a change of plans.

94
00:04:51,610 --> 00:04:55,950
It’s is sort of a reflex at this point — we
don’t even keep track of how much we use

95
00:04:55,950 --> 00:04:56,440
it.

96
00:04:56,440 --> 00:05:01,660
Which might be why OK was arguably the first
word spoken when humans landed on the moon.

97
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:13,640
Not bad for a corny joke from the 1830s.

98
00:05:14,340 --> 00:00:00,000
Alright guys, cut it out.
