00:00:02,520 --> 00:00:07,080
The design of the modern tennis racket goes
back to England in 1874

2
00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:10,680
and a man named Major Walter Clopton Wingfield.

3
00:00:10,680 --> 00:00:13,620
Wingfield patented the rules for a game known
as lawn tennis,

4
00:00:13,620 --> 00:00:17,440
standardising elements like balls, nets and rackets.

5
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:22,430
For the next century rackets would be made
of wood and remain similar in shape to Wingfield's

6
00:00:22,430 --> 00:00:23,990
original design.

7
00:00:23,990 --> 00:00:29,630
But in 1961 French tennis legend Rene Lacoste
unveiled a radical invention.

8
00:00:29,630 --> 00:00:35,150
"The Crocodile" - as he was nicknamed - had
made a prototype using metal.

9
00:00:35,150 --> 00:00:40,410
Just a few years later Wilson released the
T-2000, the first stainless steel racket whose

10
00:00:40,410 --> 00:00:45,460
futuristic design caught the eye of players
like Billie Jean King and Jimmy Connors.

11
00:00:45,460 --> 00:00:51,060
Its small head and open throat reduced air
resistance and helped Connors win the US Open

12
00:00:51,060 --> 00:00:52,700
5 times.

13
00:00:52,700 --> 00:00:59,630
The 1970s ushered in an era of aluminium which
was lighter and easier to mould than steel.

14
00:00:59,630 --> 00:01:04,390
This was followed by fashionable oversized
racquets that had a larger sweet spot and

15
00:01:04,390 --> 00:01:06,390
gave players more power.

16
00:01:06,390 --> 00:01:12,049
Eventually the quest for lightness and durability
led to graphite rackets as well as other materials

17
00:01:12,049 --> 00:01:14,700
like kevlar and graphene.

18
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:19,840
Today Wilson and French brand Babolat dominate
both the men’s and women’s game with the

19
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:25,619
two brands winning 71% of professional tournaments
in 2017.

20
00:01:25,619 --> 00:00:00,000
Precise and powerful this is the design that’s
helped to create legends with every stroke.
