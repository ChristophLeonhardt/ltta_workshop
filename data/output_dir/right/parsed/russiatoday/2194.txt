over to Florida now where four people
have been confirmed dead after a newly
installed pedestrian bridge crossing a
road collapsed my number of vehicles are
still trapped under the bridge and
emergency rescue teams continue to
search for people buried in the rubble
now the cause for the collapse has not
been determined so far the bridge was
installed less than a week ago at
Florida International University
University said the method used in the
construction was supposed to reduce
risks to workers and pedestrians and
minimize traffic disruption
