several airlines are re-examining their practices after a recent incident on a United Airlines jet United Airlines overbooked the flight and offered $1,000 to any passenger who would give up his ticket when no one did the airline randomly selected a passenger and had the police drag him from the plane smashing his face into the armrest as they went the passenger was then taken out on the tarmac and shot to death and his head was later stuck on a pike and set outside the United check-in desk with a sign that read next time take the thousand dollars United CEO Oscar desaad later issued a statement defending the airlines actions saying that beating and killing passengers was a much cheaper form of in-flight entertainment than those annoying little TVs in the backs of the seats it's nearly impossible to hear movie dialogue over the jet engines desaad said whereas nothing says entertainment like watching your passengers body bounce around in the aisle as he's being dragged away in handcuffs desaad later apologized for his statement saying quote I was just kidding and if you don't think it's funny our flight and tent attendants will be happy to kick the crap out of you no I'm kidding and if you can't take a joke we may have to shove a bag of tasteless pretzels down your throat no I'm kidding unquote unwilling to let United out do them in the public relations department American Airlines soon entered the competition for best customer service a recent video I'm not making this up a recent video taken by a passenger shows an American flight attendant ripping a stroller out of the hands of a sobbing mother who is holding two children witnesses say the flight attendant hit the mother with the stroller as he was grabbing it and narrowly missed hitting one of the babies when a male passenger tried to defend the mother the flight attendant offered to fight him American says the flight attendants behavior as part of a new service the airline is providing to cut down on the number of annoying babies on flights American says the babies tend to cry and irritate the other passengers and the airline feels that by brutalizing the children's mother's they'll send a message to babies to stay away if they know what's good for them the airline's statement said and this is a real quote the actions of our team member do not appear to reflect patience or empathy unquote it's not clear whether the lack of patience and empathy refers to the part where the attendant clocked the sobbing mom with the stroll as she tearfully begged him to give the stroller back or when he later served a passenger a box lunch containing a sponge cake that tasted like a bunch of lint held together with paste in the aftermath of these two incidents American and United discussing whether to merge their companies into one enormous collection of empty planes that no one ever flies on again trigger warning I'm Andrew Clavin and this is the Andrew Clavin show all right the last day before the Clavin last weekend a shorter Clavin this weekend begins but we have Robert Spencer here Robert Spencer this is not Richard Spencer I keep it fixing him up Richard Spencer is the Nazi Robert Spencer is one of the foremost experts on jihad and Islam he is the director of jihad watch which is over at the David Horowitz Freedom Center I always I really like Bob because he's one of the nicest you know people around very mild-mannered but it's what he does takes so much courage to say the things he says and he's just very direct and he really knows his stuff so we're gonna talk to him we're gonna stay on Facebook so you can watch the interview but you might want to come over to the Daily wired.com and subscribe because then you can be in the mailbag next week and also if you subscribe for a year it's only a lousy eight bucks a month come on what's wrong with you if you subscribe for a year we will send you a free copy of the arroyo excellent film about the border troubles and we'll send it to you for free on DVD for a year subscription all right Scott Adams you know the the Dilbert guy who does the Dilbert cartoons in the newspaper Scott Adams has become one of the most interesting observers of the Trump administration he doesn't really deal with policy what he does is he deals with Trump as a as a businessman as a guy who likes to convince people and he had a funny column on his blog where he says everyone observing politics seems to agree on two things about a president's first hundred days in office one a hundred days is a meaningless arbitrary marker for a president's performance that is likely to be more misleading than useful and two let's treat it like it's important that's basically what we're gonna do today the hundred days 100 days is a totally phony deadline you know it started with FDR because Roosevelt called a special session of Congress to deal with the depression to deal with the crash and the special session of Congress lasted a hundred days and that is what they're talking about if nowadays if you judged a hundred days by how much Congress works it would last for I think six years because they take every every other day off so the first thing I want to start with is this interview that Reuters did with Trump this is a genuinely touching interview where Trump talks about his feelings about it just listen to what he says you I love my right I love my previous life I loved my previous life I had so many things I I actually this is more work than in my previous life I thought it would be easier I thought it was more of a I'm a details oriented person I think you would say that but I do miss my old life this I like to work so that's not a problem but this is actually more work and while I had very little privacy in my old life because you know I've been famous for a long time I really this is this is much less privacy than I've ever seen before I mean this is you know something something that's really amazing at the same time you're really into your own little cocoon because you have such massive protection that you really can't go anywhere yeah I mean I used to like I was able to go out to restaurants and even though people know who I was I like to what I like to drive I can't drive any it's kind of touching I mean you can make fun of them you know like I didn't know their job of being president the United States was gonna be hard it's like it's kind of like it's like a reality star didn't realize there was actual reality you know reality there's reality TV and then there's reality you know it's like you didn't notice that he just sounds to me like the dog who caught the car though you know like he saw he thought like I could be President you know so as a result of this I mean obviously people are picking on Trump you know say ously the left is picking on him I'll talk about that in a sec but like but but everybody's sort of saying well he hasn't done all the things he said he was gonna do and of course he made a totally realist and realistic list of things that he was gonna do and plus he's had to become he's had to drop some of the rhetoric that he uses you know he go in with China and he was gonna declare that they were currency manipulators and then he sits down with the Chinese President and he says can you give me some help with North Korea because these people are nuts and they're gonna blow us all to kingdom come and like then maybe it's not so good to call the guy a currency manipulator when you need help in something really serious like this even though China is a currency manipulator and it just the way he's dealt with his his staff you know it's not that Steve Bannon is gone the presses are constantly firing Steve Bannon but Steve man is still there he's just kind of keeping these guys back at Kellyanne Conway and he's put Jared Kushner who's more of a sort of you know presentable centrist face I mean I said when Trump got elected that I thought he was going to be an okay middle-of-the-road Democrat president basically you know not a not a leftist like Obama but still kind of a Democrat presidency so far you know if you take obviously Neil Gorsuch no Democrat would have appointed him and the attack on regulations which is something very near and dear to my heart here's karl rove talking about the accomplishments of the first hundred days he says he recruited an impressive cabinet especially in the foreign policy and national security error areas and this is another thing i mean not to just blow my horn it's the thing I was right about as Rex Tillerson has been absolutely great he was on with Bret Baier last night gave a long interview just he was he was humble he was straightforward he said he understood that running a company was not the same thing as dealing with matters of life and death you know Trump himself Trump himself seems humbled by the office and this is one of the things you know Shapiro and I the night Ben Shapiro neither night he got elected Shapiro says well said well you know power has never been good for anybody has never improved anybody and I said the other side of that which is you know it's true Howard doesn't improve people most of the time but the other side of that is the gravity of the office has frequently lifted people to a higher level even Obama who I really thought was the worst president of my lifetime even he started to understand that he was dealing with something that was a little bit almost bigger than himself you know almost he almost started to realize it was bigger than himself but Trump has realized that and the I forgot to get his name ruddy from Newsmax was a pal of Trump said that after the Syria bombing you know he kind of congratulated Trump on how well it went and Trump was very solemn about it you know he didn't brag about it he understood that people died in these things and you know some times it's some innocent guy who's just walking by who dies and even though you have to fight wars it's not a pretty thing more from Rovi said his spectacular Supreme Court nominee was confirmed and mr. Trump green light of the Keystone XL and Dakota access pipelines you forget these things because they kind of come and go he took action against Syria adopted a surprisingly tough line on Russia and held positive meetings with world leaders mr. Trump froze hiring of many federal workers required rescinding two regulations of equal cost for every new rule created signed laws repealing last minute Obama regulations that cost the economy billions the stock market is up around 14% since election day and consumers are far more confident than they've been in years mr. Trump also points to nixing the trans-pacific partnership and issuing dozens of executive orders browbeating Ford and carrier to keep jobs in America and slowing illegal immigration Scott Adams the Dilbert guy again says most of the problems with the Trump administration are imaginary what Adams point is is that there's nothing to compare Trump's hundred days to because no one has ever had the situations that he has you could find similar things but it's always different so there's no scientific basis on which to compare anything but Scott Adams says he has all these imaginary problems he has imagined problems on his tax returns imagine blackmail by Russia imagine poor performance based on imagining a control case of another imaginary president doing the same job at the same time but doing it faster imaginary belief that doing things you prefer he not do is similar to not being competent imagine staff problems that are bigger than they are imagine nuclear holocaust that happens because of Trump's imaginary ins you know that if you read Rudge we have all been killed by North Korea like 15 times in the last couple of weeks imagine problems caused by his ignoring of facts that don't matter imagine future climate calamity they could be right but for now it is imaginary because complex models have a bad track record that one thing of course that we have to point out is the lack of substantial legislation and that's the thing that you know you can you can blame Trump for this and obviously a president's job is to lead and to inspire and to guide the Congress but but there is genuinely something wrong with the Republicans in Congress right now they are not getting the picture first of all a lot of them don't Tromp remember Trump took over their party and they he was not the guy any of them wanted and they don't they're not inspired to help him out you know but if they would put their country first I mean if I were in this situation and I think Paul Ryan has tried to do this but he hasn't been effective so far if I were in this situation what I would do is I would sit down with the guys and say look if let's say Trump is bad at convincing the Congress to do what he wants let's say that's the case I would sit down with Congress say look this is us we have to do this we have to deliver for the president because otherwise we are going to betray our country and and lose our seats you know this is kind of what Paul Ryan was saying he was saying that like we owe the people this here is Paul Ryan talking about the promises they make I think people seats are at risk if we don't do what we said we would do we all campaigns on repealing and replacing this law that is collapsing the American health care system in the individual market is in peril right now we have a moral obligation to prevent people from getting hurt to stop damage from being continued and we promised that we would do this if you violate your promise if you commit the sin of apocrypha and out in politics that's the greater risk I think to a person see so you know that that's exactly right and I think that that's what these guys have to find out on and I'm like like singling out the freedom caucus the Conservatives of the moderates and all this they now say they now got a new compromise on health care and I'll talk about this another time I really like this compromise on health care they're not for some of the reasons you think it's got something to make everybody angry but it gives States a chance to opt out and since Obamacare is collapsing I think a lot of states are gonna do that I think it's an actual brilliant compromise mark Meadows the head of the freedom caucus says he thinks they've got the votes to get this through it's not necessarily a more conservative bill but it is a bill that lowers premiums for the American people allows us to hopefully get on to tax reform in a very quick fashion in the coming day so I want to be clear here the votes are there from the house freedom caucus as well as the Republicans in the House of Representatives I'm not the whip for the entire GOP conference and so I appreciate you clarifying that certainly from the house freedom caucus we took an official position which means more than 80% of our members are on board actually it's a little bit more than that and so based on a previous whip count as long as we don't have any more defections I think that we will be there so if that happens and then he can move on to his he's got this massive new tax reform bill which I really like as well because it's not just a tax cut which Republicans are always very good at doing it's a genuine reform of the tax system the first one we've had since Reagan it isn't deeply deeply necessary conservatives are complaining that he hasn't got wall funding because the Democrats are threatening to shut down Congress and of course shut down the government of course whenever the conte government gets shut down it's the Republicans fault in the press so the Republicans are very shy of having that happen and Trump seems to be giving way on getting funding for the wall right now the funny thing about the wall is you know he has really has cut back on illegal immigration just by enforcing the laws we have he has cut by back on illegal immigration I doubt a wall is gonna make much difference I doubt it is most people don't care whether he builds a wall but he did say it every single day of his campaign and people like Ann Coulter are really like hammering away at it and it's is symbolic at this point of his getting stuff done but one thing I just want to mention and then we're gonna bring on Robert Spencer from jihad watch but the one thing I really want to mention is that the press the first hundred days of the Trump administration of the press the press has covered itself in shame they have disgraced themselves if it were possible to disgrace themselves in order to disgrace yourself you have to have some grace the press the media basically threw away all its grace all its credibility not covering the scandals of the Obama administration not giving Obama a fair coverage but basically hey geography seeing him turning him in into a saint and now they've just unleashed against Trump in a way that it just makes them they're liars they're just liars it's constant line if you don't believe me I have to play this this is CBS this is not this is a news story okay Trump came out with his tax reform plan and it's very very difficult to parse how tax reform is going to play out you know really takes a lot of mathematics to figure out who's going to be affected how and things don't go the way you seem the New York Times headline which they later changed as they always do they disappear their headlines but their first headline was something like I'm talking from memory but it was you know Trump issues new tax reform plan that will help the wealthiest you know that's well that's what it will do here is CBS this guy Scott Pelley where Ted Baxter as I call him from The Mary Tyler Moore Show Scott Pelley this is his lead-in and this is not an editorial this is his lead-in to Trump's tax reform today the Trump administration rushed out a plan for historic tax cuts high on hyperbole but with only a dollop of detail the list of aspirations looked more like an attempt to beat the 100 day mark in the Trump presidency rather than a serious proposal to reform the tax code on paper everyone's in for a break personal income taxes corporate taxes savings for the rich and the dead but nothing on how to implement it or pay for it far from legislation the president's bullet points today were loaded into a starting gun that signals the beginning of a race of lobbyists and special interests to rewrite America's 70,000 page tax code Wow I mean you know it's like hey Scott nobody asked your opinion looks like report the news you know people are turning these people want to get the news Scott Pelley is betraying it and the thing is the guy is Ted Baxter he's got the silver hair he's got the deep voice he's an idiot I just got to replay this cut of Ted Baxter from The Mary Tyler Moore Show the the classic Scott Pelley newsman Washington cases in the news make that the case Watergate and my incredible sources tell me exclusively we will continue to keep our eye on the latest developments there elsewhere around the nation more weather heading our way and some especially good news for residents of our area despite the tornado watch and severe hurricane warning today's pollution index was only six six that's six of course sex is on a scale of one to seven and that's the same type of scale we use at home with our bachelors at home and we're back on our weight watchers speaking of their trouble in South America here's a special report via satellite from the special correspondent muck wrecker muck that Scott Pelley or Ted Baxter that I can't you never see the two of them together at the same time so they may be the same person this by the way this stuff with Trump is the total opposite of the way Obama was greeted during hers first hundred days John Hayward at Breitbart lists the ways it's worth taking a look Time magazine dubbed the obama administration a historic presidency at the top of its hundred day special coverage then brought in joe klein to declare obama start the most impressive of any president since FBR FDR mark halperin gushed that obama was instantly comfortable and highly skilled at the hardest job in the world Halpern faulted Obama only for a handful of public missteps comparisons to FDR were ubiquitous and Obama's hundred days covered so you know Trump has been swimming upstream I have said repeatedly that he is a man who learns things which i think is really impressive and I'm still willing to give him a chance he is so much better than I feared he would be I was wrong in my predictions of disaster and I'm just delighted to say it more to come so will we will find out if it really is up to the GOP it really is up to Congress now how this goes and if they just insist on not doing their jobs because they dislike Trump they'll be like the guy who poisons himself hoping somebody else will die because it's there they're the ones who will go down it maybe as well as Trump but there they will certainly go down all right let's bring on Robert Spencer he is the director of jihad watch a program of the David Horowitz Freedom Center he's the author of 16 books including the New York Times bestsellers the politically incorrect guy to Islam and the Crusades and the truth about Mohammed his latest book is the complete infidels guide to Iran and coming in this year is the complete infidels guide to free speech and its enemies I so I guess Robert are gonna be writing about Berkeley and the our universities I guess it's all in there it's good to see you by the way and I was pointing out that I think you are a courageous fellow and you always do it with a great deal of good humor and you always seem so easygoing but I never liked to sit too close to you because I so let me ask you I mean you have you have been just steadfast in not letting people forget about the jihad not letting people forget about America's enemies people committed to destroying us you've seen Trump elected how are you feeling about the first hundred days in regard to the fight against jihad well it's like night and day from Obama like you were saying about the other issues obviously Trump is trying to do something in the first place about domestic jihad attacks by limiting immigration from jihadi hot spots and he's been stymied in that but she can't fault him for doing for for that that's something that comes from he's leftist activist judges what's interesting about both of the blocks on his executive orders is that despite the manifest realities that the executive orders were dealing with they just brushed them all aside there are 72 jihadis who have been convicted of jihad activity from the countries listed in the ban and they claimed that there wasn't any significant jihad threat from those countries that there is very specific US law giving the president the responsibility and the right and the authority to limit immigration for any reason and neither one of the blocks on his executive orders even mentioned that law this is raw judicial dictatorship they were not interpreting the law they were not deciding whether or not his executive orders were in accord with the law they were ignoring the law and legislating their own leftist agenda well let me ask you this then I mean obviously I agree with all that but what about his actions you know in Syria his actions with Iran do you think that he is handling the actual Middle East Wars in a better way than Obama was I'll tell you Andrew I was very concerned when he bombed the Asad Air Base and it's not because I don't know that assad is a scoundrel but you got to ask the old Leninist question who benefits uh uh beneficiary if you take out Assad is going to be the al Qaeda groups that Obama was backing to his everlasting shame and Isis the Islamic state and the Russians are backing Assad because they realized that and there's just no good guy in this game now at the same time having said all that you also have to grant that behind Assad is Iran and Trump has very strongly put Iran on notice and so we've got to deal with the twin threats of Iran and Isis and he's got to navigate that very carefully and and he hit the ISIS base in Afghanistan right after he hit Assad so it looks to me like he's trying to deal with both sides of the situation you know I was just in Oberlin you know this very very liberal college and I was giving his speech and one of the things that I said was that there's no such thing as Islamophobia I was just pointing out that nobody is phobic about you know there's nobody in America who suddenly has an irrational fear of Islam that just came out of the air that didn't happen and they were very upset that I said this the kids were just really they really thought this was bad there was a story the other day out of just a it's a minor story but out of London that Katie Spencer this TV personality there tweeted about some jihadi and she made some remark and everybody attacked her this idea that somehow is jihad is our fault okay well let me let me start with this let me start with this question is jihad an existential threat to us I mean every day I see about North Korea is jihad an existential threat certainly absolutely just like North Korea Isis has repeatedly called upon Muslims in the West to commit jihad attacks jihad massacres against American civilians British civilians French and so on they have called upon Muslims to do this and they have been obeyed there have been numerous Muslims including Omar Mateen the pulse nightclub Massacre the pulse nightclub mass murderer who killed forty nine people there and we did another fifty three many others the San Bernardino killers who said they doing it in obedience to the call of Isis and the idea here is not just a soap and differentiating mayhem but to overwhelm our law enforcement apparatus they can't keep track of all the plots and will ultimately collapse that might seem far-fetched but actually we have seen it again and again now that there's a jihadi and then we hear yes he was known to authorities but they weren't tracking him because they had other people they thought were scarier that they were dealing with is the problem here it seems to me the great question of the day and I and I know you have a very definite opinion about this but the great question of the day seems to me is the problem Islam or is this a cancer on the face of Islam is the is the violence inherent in Islamic religion obviously we're not saying all people are violent but is the violence inherent is in Islamic religion or is it a cancer growing on the religion for other reasons there are key distinctions that have to be made for that Andrew one is the one you just made between Muslims and Islam what islam teaches is one thing but how every Muslim puts it into practice is another Jesus says turn the other cheek and love your enemies that doesn't mean that every Christian is a sweetheart and it's the same thing in Islam in Islam it says kill them wherever you find them three times in the Quran it says wage war against the people of the book that's Jews and Christians until they pay the jizya attacks with willing submission and feel themselves subdued it says when you meet the unbelievers strike the next that is behead them and so these things are in the Quran and this is the unalterable perfect word of Allah that is valid for all time this doesn't mean every Muslim is gonna carry that out but that's not a cancer on Islam that is Islam itself okay then why is it what is this thing with with Westerners and this happened in Overland and it's happening in London with this girl Katie Spencer what is this urge while I was talking somebody started shouting out you know the problem is our imperialism not their religion well let me divide this into two questions first obviously we have done things that have helped jihad like our relationship with Saudi Arabia I think has sometimes been beneficial to the jihadis oh yeah so we have a role we have played a role in this it's fair to say we have played and exacerbating this problem isn't oh yeah absolutely but the jihad is a lot older than the United States of America and it's not as there was no Byzantine Imperial Imperial imperialism against Arabia the Byzantines were interested in Arabia the Persians weren't invading Arabia nobody was bothering them and they came out of Arabia and conquered all the Middle East and North Africa and had an empire stretching from Spain to India within a hundred years none of those places that were conquered in those Jihad's had been threatening the Muslims or invading Islamic lands so what is it with Westerners why why'd Westerners immediately look to blame themselves why when somebody tweets about a terrorist and gets angry and she said something like and Ramadan hasn't even started yet wait at least hungry then he'll really get mean and people just piled on or called they reported her to the police and all the stuff what is it with the West that we blame ourselves for their bad philosophy well you know Muslim advocacy groups in the US and in Britain most of which are tied to the Muslim Brotherhood they have very skillfully played the victim card they have played upon the West's traumas the the worst sin in the United States is racism and that's from our national history and people are definitely afraid of being charged with racism so Muslims have come in very skillfully even though Islam is not a race portrayed any criticism of Islam or even of Jihad terror as some kind of racist bigotry and they have cowed the left into going along with that because that is the cardinal sin that everybody wants to avoid that well that's a brilliant answer I asked a tough question that is a good answer looking forward what are the you know solutions I remember when I was at our friend David Horowitz one of his gatherings Geert we'll ders was there and he was talking and I was sitting next to Michael Barone and we'll ders said you know we should we should stop them from building mosques and I remember Barone who tends to kind of murmur to himself going wait we can't do that you know we have a constitution that protects you know freedom of religion and freedom of worship what solutions do you see I mean what do you see you know we nobody is willing to crack down on religion in America unless of course it's the Christian religion but what what solutions do you see for the United States that don't violate our commitment to free religion well absolutely we have to remember that every that the Constitution grants the freedom of religion but the Constitution grants the freedom of religion in order to protect and defend the United States not giving people an excuse for treason and Sedition it's not some sort of license to break all other American laws and then claim the freedom of religion as your excuse the freedom of religion means where there other laws begin and the you know there's precedent for this the US Supreme Court in 1890 said that the Utah would not be allowed to become a state unless the Latter day Saints outlawed polygamy and this was a matter of their religious freedom but there was an ash compelling national interest that was considered all of that and it would seem to me the same way here Muslims are perfectly free to practice their religion and Crake to a lot Bob read the Quran consider Muhammad a prophet and so on but that does not give them a license to perform female genital mutilation honor killing jihad warfare any of the things that are mandated in the car Islamic teaching that are at variance with American law so you wouldn't you wouldn't stop the practice of Islam what you would stop is simply the crimes the growth that you feel grow out of Islam is that fair to say yeah and when a preacher is preaching that this that it Sharia has to replace the US Constitution as is preached in many American mosques today is the basis it's shown then that has to be understood as frankly seditious and prosecuted according interesting okay well Robert well I'm gonna I hope you'll come back and talk as the Trump administration continues and we can talk about his strategies Robert Spencer the director of jihad watch the author of the politically incorrect guide to Islam in the upcoming is an out yet the complete in Vitelli guide to free speech is that out yet right when he says all right the complete infidels guide to Iran is already out and the complete infidels guy to free speech and its enemies from Robert Spencer the director of jihad watch which you can that's jihad watch.org watch.org okay great thanks a lot Robert it's good to see you and I'll thank you all right - guy is very sharp and he knows he knows like every word in the Koran and every you know period and like I said that we do him by remote cuz we're all afraid of dying my snake lost all right speaking of Islam by the way in The Wall Street Journal today my pal Paul besten has a spectacular piece in The Wall Street Journal op-ed page about Muhammad Ali and it really turned my head because I did not know this about Ali he talks about why he refused to go to Vietnam why he refused the draft and that of course has been sort of depicted as this heroic decision standing up against the Vietnam War and Paul besten is writing a book about boxing and he comes out with the truth and he's very well documented in detail and I won't tell you about it because I think you should just go read it it's in the Wall Street Journal as I am coming in to stuff I like yesterday you know one of the things about the right conservatives that I've been complaining about now for quite a long time is our failure to engage in the culture and I love to see the fact that as right-wingers are coming up the young young right-wingers are coming up they are developing I saw this at Oberlin with the conservatives and libertarians there they're developing this impish troller sense of humor that is starting to bleed out and it's absolutely terrific yesterday this was the biggest laugh I had yesterday a place called freedom tombs all right put out a cartoon about ben shapiro talking to live the way Ben talks to liberals well you know it down college campuses this thing had me in stitches just play the whole thing that's really funny so you've supported like this really racist idea that health care should not be for free and I just wanted to ask about that okay so here's how this works gang honestly if you can't see that a universal health care system is bad for America you're wasting my time okay okay folks so the health care cost crisis didn't actually begin until the government got involved by creating Medicare and Medicaid because when you artificially stimulate demand there's no incentive to lower price not to mention you are not entitled to the product of somebody else's labor that's called slavery gang okay this is what would actually happen under a universal healthcare system here's what a single-payer health care system would actually do okay folks it would actually make doctors literal slaves who would have to live in cabins on a plantation somewhere alright folks and the idea and the idea that doctors are just your slaves you can you can you know marry without their consent and then make half doctor have regular people babies with okay well then what happens to the babies are they now doctors are they slave doctors who have to be doctors are they free look at now what King okay so that's why that system would just never work but but what I should just get health care I should just get it for free you can't see the red rays just blast out of Shapiro's eyes and just destroy the guy and by the way you know it's a cartoon but that was a real event that actually does actually can do that you know I actually can shoot those rays out of his eyes I just love that it was really really funny alright stuff I like a shout out to today's last end of the week stuff I like is exactly the same as the stuff I liked before because last week I played a song that I just love an old song called angeleka and I heard it from these guys who opened for Bill Cosby a million years ago and I have not had not been able to find them and I have to shout out to listener Alex Smith about three people only only three people came up with this but Alex Smith came up with it first he found these people the pair extraordinaire and I sent Alex a copy of my book the great good thing a secular Jew comes to faith in Christ I gave him a choice between that and we're wolf cop and he took that but I was really grateful I looked for these guys for over a year and I'm like I'm a good internet guy you know I can find things on the Internet I could not for the life of me find them and they're not available in some of their stuff is in CD one or two of their pieces are in CD but this particular album with angeleka on it is not you can't get it anyway but in vinyl and they were two guys who they it was just a vocalist and a bass player that's all it was and Carl Mathis Kraig was the vocalist he died in 2012 he became an actor and he did good works in Dallas running a scholarship for kids interested in the arts the bass player was a Marcus Hemphill and he became went on to become a New York playwright and TV writer and you actually wrote for the Bill Cosby Show after opening for Cosby but both of them teamed up they were both from Texas I think and they teamed up to become the pair extraordinaire and they were a popular jazz duo and they performed in Greenwich Village and they recorded several albums and they were open for Bill Cosby and Bill Dana nobody remembers Bill Danny but he was a big comedian in the time and appeared on Dean Martin's and Danny Kaye's television shows on stage in Las Vegas and they were just spectacular there really were good and you can hear the thing that I loved about their rendition about angeleka which nobody else gets this including last week I think that we played the guy who wrote the song and he didn't get it the song is overdramatic it's like a very very sentimental big song and so they play it down and they just kind of sing it in a very naturalistic way and kind of play into the jazz of it and it really is beautiful and kind of a it's really a heartbreaking song and very very touching the way they do it the pair extraordinaire and thank you to listener Alex Smith for finding
