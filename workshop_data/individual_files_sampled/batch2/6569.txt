if you're concerned about programs that offer student loan forgiveness under the trump administration you should be but it turns out that Congress actually included some funding to help those with student loan debt in their new spending bill so let me give you the details on it keep in mind that this is by no means a big fix or even a small fix it is a miniscule fix but it could positively impact your life and I want to make sure you have the information about it now this story has to do with the public service loan forgiveness program which was implemented under the Bush administration the whole point of the program was to offer student loan forgiveness to individuals who take up jobs in public service or for nonprofits and as long as they work at that organization for ten years and make payments toward their student loan in those ten years after that decade is up that student loan would be forgiven now there was some worry that the Trump administration would not honor the program and there was a lack of funding to honor the program however Congress has included some funding in their recent spending bill to help with this issue now as part of the new 1.3 trillion dollar federal spending bill Congress authorized a 350 million dollar fix to fund a popular student loan forgiveness plan that many financial experts say is currently failing now in order to qualify you'll still need to have a loan from this direct program you've had to have made all your payments in full and on time in that 10 year span and you had to have worked ten years in a public service job with a qualifying employer now as long as you meet all of those requirements you could apply to have your debt forgiven in about two months so in two months they will open up the application process now the forgiveness plan will be given out on a first come first serve basis the reason why I mention that is because 350 million dollars obviously is not enough to help all students who are part of this program which is frustrating because it is unprecedented for Congress to implement something on this first come first basis however I mean there's something like a lot of the tax credits for electric vehicles and things like that had a certain amount that it was large enough that presumably most people would be able to get it right so it wasn't stringent but there there was a cap so let me let me give you the caveat so you understand what I mean what I mean is this program was implemented without this first-come first-served basis and now it's being put on top exactly so there were people who under the Bush administration thought hey this is a good deal I want to have my loans forgiven in ten years so I'm gonna apply for this program and I'm gonna do exactly what this program needs me to do so they entered public service or worked for a non-profit they made their payments toward their loan dutifully you know over the last decade and then BOOM under the Trump administration mmm we're only gonna apply a 350 million dollar funding effort toward this and it's first-come first-served basis that's what I mean yeah so they kind of reneged on a promise that was made under the Bush administration but still if you do want to see this continue past when this money runs out it could be that future spending bills will be similar I know that Trump wasn't a fan of it partially based on what's in the bill and partially based on we're now seeing reports today that he doesn't actually know what's in it I'm never gonna sign a bill like this again I don't know what's in it but I don't like it ya know we're gonna sign it no that's a strong position yeah but anyway but maybe we'll have more bills like this that will continue it maybe not maybe we need a fundamental change to Congress to hopefully ensure that these sorts of programs will be fund in the future but yeah that look that spending bill overall we talked about it when it was passed they spent way too much money in the military that there's a number of things I disagree with them that are huge waste of money but they did get quite a few things like this and didn't fund a number of different programs that I found most objectionable so I know we're not supposed to say anything positive really ever but certainly about the people who are in government right now but it could have been much worse as 350 million dollars is a tiny unnoticeable fragment of 1.3 trillion dollars but for the people who will have their student loans forgiven as a result of this program that's very positive and again I want to make sure that if you were part of this program that you stay on top of this and when you're able to apply for the loan forgiveness in about two months you go for it because again first come first serve basis and I just want to look out for you guys oh and one other thing if you're a conservative doesn't like this program and especially doesn't love having to continually fund it over and over and over let's just have to ition free public access to college system we have to worry about the debt after all I'd like that I mean it's it is fascinating that we always have enough money to fund weapons manufacturers and private contractors in the Defense Department but we don't have the money to help out our fellow Americans and and help them wipe their debt after dedicating a decade of their lives to public service what you just watched was one of the videos that we do today but we actually do a whole two-hour show every single day it's a podcast you could watch it a video or listen
