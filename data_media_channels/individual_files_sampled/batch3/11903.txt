hello their friend Max Keiser this is the Kaiser report the show that expands your mind and your pocketbook sometimes Jason obviously this is the ninth birthday week of Bitcoin so I'm gonna stick on this but I know also a lot of people have not only indigestion from the new year still but they also have indigestion from the you know baptism by market crashes and volatility you know most people got into Bitcoin in 2017 and they only saw up a parabolic up and it was like it was like pennies from heaven it was like wonderful and then a lot of volatility hit over Christmas so I'm assuming there's a lot of indigestion and fear and panic and self-loathing and all sorts of stuff happening so we're gonna look at this article that Jameson lop as we mentioned when we were hanging out with him for the Bitcoin birthday party last night and I want to talk about a take a step back to understand where Bitcoin came from and by understanding the genesis of the Genesis block that happened on January 3rd 2009 I understand where the future might be what might happen in 9 years from now Bitcoin and the rise of the cypher punks this is an important term to understand and the cypherpunks because right now most of the attention for all the newbies involved in cryptocurrency is all about the corporate side everything on CNBC Bloomberg what they're focusing on and for us to watch CNBC and Bloomberg it's quite interesting because it's it's not at all what most people it all the OGIS like the original gangsters of Bitcoin nobody really talks about these aren't what are important to the Bitcoin community but it's a corporate side and that's their side of the story but we're looking at the origin what happened from Bitcoin to blockchain to distributed Ledger's the cryptocurrency space is fast evolving to the point where it can be difficult to see which direction that's headed but we're not without clues while many of the innovations in the space are new they are built on deck aids of work that led to this point by tracing this history we can understand the motivations behind the movement that spawned Bitcoin and share his vision for the future so he starts with the history which was in the 70s and at that time cryptography was invented and created and developed by the US military by that likes of the NSA and CIA mostly NSA so they developed cryptography and it was at that time that all of the guys with the knowledge of that this was considered basically state secret was like you know you can't just sell somebody US military technology this was considered military technology to tell them about cryptography to tell them about encryption so in the 70s was crypto war one there was crypto war one the cryptographers against the government they wanted to open-source it and share this encryption technology in order to keep the Internet and communication private this notion of privacy not secrecy but privacy for the individual participating online the idea of privacy is enshrined in the Constitution clearly you can interpret there the right to assemble as the right to assemble and communicate privately they think about if that were not the case before the American Revolution if there were no private meetings and think about the American Revolutionary War without George Washington's ability to send message privately out there in the the colonies to to organize the the war against the the Empire yeah well he obviously needed secrecy these were secrets he was keeping from the crown and there is a legitimate reason for secrecy and all these early cryptographers did understand that you wanted secrets kept from your enemies and you know it will during World War two we didn't want the Nazis to have our our knowledge we use those you know Native Americans said they spoke the language that they not just going to speak we were keeping information secret from them however there's privacy these curtains are open right now behind us because where everybody's going to watch this on you - were not trying to hide anything we're happy for anybody to walk past there and look at us but if we were walking around naked or in our underwear or you know just hanging out with our friends here we do much we you could possibly be Dutch if you've ever been to answer them they don't seem to have curtains they don't seem to mind not having much privacy but nevertheless we're not we're American and we're in America and you know you you want to keep some things private you went your own intimate private space this is what they want to maintain for the people so then he goes into the 1980s he lists a few of the key people remember this the title of this article is Bitcoin and the rise of the cypherpunks it's really we can't get into it here we don't have enough time but you should go read it and find out the history of it but it was in 1992 where the term cypherpunks was first coined San Francisco of course everything happens there in 1992 Eric Hughes Timothy C May and John Gilmer founded a small group that met monthly at Gilmore's company Cygnus solutions in the San Francisco Bay Area the group was humorously termed cypherpunks as a derivation of cipher and cyberpunk the cypherpunks mailing list was formed at the same time and just a few months later Eric Hughes published a cypherpunks manifesto he wrote privacy is necessary for an open society in the electronic age privacy is not secrecy a private matter is something one does not want the world to know but a secret matter is something one doesn't want anybody to know privacy is the power to selectively reveal oneself to the world so this was the birth of the cyberpunk movement and this these are the people the cypherpunks who invented the technology that is Bitcoin that that is the foundation upon which Bitcoin is built right they were getting into the how we got to Genesis block and the idea of having private messages sent require electronically required advances in technology and I believe at some point in this story the government's work in creating encryption was kind of released wasn't it it was it was released finally after big battles between these guys in the 90s in in San Francisco and the government and there were threats to arrest them there were threats that they were a revealing state secrets and that's important to understand and that's in the the documentation here that he's talking about but then the technology here just like remember in the last episode we talked about the Precambrian explosion of all these ideas emerging here here are the ideas that went into it in in the you know biological life there were creatures with seven eyes creatures with ten eyes creatures with three eyes you know there were all sorts of attempts at various configurations but you could see that eyes were going to be a good evolutionary design it was it was useful and eventually two eyes was the one that was settled on that was a standard upon which many biological creatures emerged that is what those guys those cypherpunks were laying out the basically the standards upon which bitcoin was built and one of the things of how to keep your messages private how to secure it was it just sent incentivize people to keep it private and he mentions that in 1997 dr. Adam back created hash cash which was designed as an anti-spam mechanism that would essentially add a time and computational cost to send an email thus making spam on economical he envisioned that hash cash would be easier for people to use than dr. charms digit cash which was created a decade earlier since there was no need for the creation of an account hashcash even has some protection against double spending then later he mentions that dr. way day published a proposal for B money a practical way to enforce contractual agreements between anonymous actors he described two interesting concepts that should sound familiar first a protocol in which every participant maintains a separate database of how much money belongs to user secondly a variant of the first system where the accounts of who has how much money are kept by a subset of the participants who are incentivized to remain honest by putting their money on the line so Bitcoin obviously copies some of those in evolved it evolves from those concepts right well you know I say often that if you look at gold is a periodic element number 79 and has unique attributes that make it great for money so you think Bitcoin not born in a vacuum and it's got 40 years of history to it and it's evolved through all these technologies it's a unique protocol and it like gold it is attracting a huge amount of capital force forth for this achievement and you can't say that you can simply go out there and create another one there are competitors of course just like there are competing species on planet earth for energy and survival but there's only one apex predator that is man at the moment before he dies from all the garbage then he goes into the 2000s you mentioned goals and that's one of the ideas like all the ideas from our history of money from our history of privacy of being humans and evolving higher intellectual you know you know speaking freely amongst each other in these groups and speaking about ideas no matter how crazy or stupid they might seem and they eventually emerge into powerful you know robust systems so he mentions Hal Finney who recently passed away he in 2004 created work which was called the reusable proof of work which built on facts Hashcash and then of course nick szabo in 2005 he did bitgold which was a digital collectable so these ideas obviously you know bitcoin is often called big gold 2.0 it's it's in fact the IRS does qualify it as a commodity as a property and asset like gold so you know these are the this is the evolution and then he's predicting where the future will go that's right and also the white paper the Satoshi white paper is it's a bitcoin assistant for digital cash transmission to moving digital cash digital cash paraphrasing which is sets off most inquiries into this onto a bit of a skewed path because they're looking at it in one use case the the replacement for the payments use case which is to ignore the entire history of this entire movement and to ignore everything else that this can possibly do including obvious references to gold and is mentioned in the white paper gold it comes from derivation from a bit gold and just always been store values always been key to this whole thing store value means of exchange a payment system or actually what the the Genesis the origin of this is about privacy I mean ultimately and the ability to protect that electronically ended up with where we are today the cyberpunk movement is the genesis movement to understand it no one's even should buy any Bitcoin without first studying the cypherpunks that's my feeling Satoshi white paper in 2008 did mention it he mentioned Hashcash MB money and he in fact Satoshi emailed Wade a directly and mentioned that he learned about be money from doctor back so this is he whoever Satoshi are they were came from the cyberpunk movement and it's important to understand and research cyberpunk because many people have piled into Bitcoin they might now be distressed about prices and other that but it's about an idea it's much bigger than just prices or doctor back is still alive he's on Twitter he's on Twitter and if you have a quite you know if you want to find out what it's about is it really Bitcoin cash asked him asked out your back what he thinks about it he'll give you the straight dope alright well we got to take a break we'll be back with a lot more right after the break welcome back to the Kaiser report I'm Max Keiser time now to go to Miami speak with Richard Hart he's a Bitcoin enthusiast who knows what he's talking about actually when it comes to technology and derivatives trading I've been following his YouTube channel for quite some time now Richard Hart welcome Thank You max pleasure being here I guess we can't avoid we got to look at this Bitcoin cash it's trading just now there's a lot of drama it's the drama of the Month Club on Bitcoin always you've got some insight into what's happening a Bitcoin cache can you dive into that a little bit Richard well I mean it's real simple if I if I made a Kaiser report cache and then you know had somebody dress up like you make a separate channel and then told everyone that it was the real Max Keiser you'd be pretty upset about that I mean you put a lot of years and work into building up your brand and making something of quality to have someone else come along that had nearly no say and how the thing was built never wrote an improvement proposal never improved the code you know basically a leech you know if a leech came along and said that Max Keiser cash was the real Max Keiser Report you'd be pretty upset about that and in the normal business world it would be illegal it's brand dilution it's you know stealing the goodwill of another company through confusion for your get-rich-quick project so you know I don't like I don't like people that pretend to compete I like real competition real competition means you get your own name you build your own unique value add and you compete you compete on price you compete on features you know if you cheat and you just copy and confuse people and have the maximum similar logo the maximum similar name the maximum similar user experience but behind the scenes it's totally fake you know the same developers don't work on your project the technology is lagging behind you know it it's gross and it would be illegal and any legacy business but because no one owns the BIC or you know name it's hard for them to find a legal standing by which to sue the imposters which is unfortunate so there's a couple of points here first is as you're getting into there its plagiarism clearly the Bitcoin cash is plagiarizing they're they're pirating the the Bitcoin name and also I guess you could point to folks in this drama like Roger ver for example they have control over Bitcoin calm the domain name which is very misleading because people go there having heard about Bitcoin and then they're led into something completely different you mentioned on your podcast before and your YouTube channel that the developers that created Bitcoin an actor like Roger Vera's profited handsomely from that so it's a real kick in the teeth - then plagiarize and steal the name steal the brand and come up with this clone or to come up with a you know a bad Chinese imitation that some have called it but there's another part of the drama and that now you've got financial media like CNBC CNBC Fast Money are now entering into this without doing any due diligence without doing any research they're pushing what's clearly a fraud and but this is this is I want to get your take on this because this is new to the whole crypto history in space in that you've got now CNBC Bloomberg and other mainstream financial news is now covering crypto how is this going to play out your thoughts Richard libertarians hate government intervention laws rules they want everything to be peer-to-peer they don't want Big Brother involved and they forget how be the past really was and every one of these laws and regulations came about because someone was doing something evil or shady and as time goes on had these laws of protected people they forget why the law was first instance instantiated so you know you've got people shilling their own bags on financial media that are heavily invested and that tie of activity is not legal in the in the stock market you know you if you're if you're the CEO of a publicly listed company you have to abide by strict rules regarding forward-looking statements and making promises to people and insider trading and because cryptocurrencies are not regulated in that way all of the problems that you saw in the past from people talking their own book insider trading you know wash trading where you pump up the price by selling to yourself at increasingly higher prices you know all of those problems are they're back they're here again and it's just funny for for people that hate the government so much to complain and cry for government invention intervention when things go wrong like this be cash lunch on G Dax they told everyone that it was going to come out in January then they surprised launched it why would you surprise launch a new financial product increasing volatility volatility decreasing people's time to plan decreasing people's time to have their coins where they need to be terribly terribly stupid - no one's benefit except insiders and you know if if there was ever a reason to see the financial regulators come down on cryptocurrency businesses in the United States like going against your own roadmap and instantly listing something against your own advice days earlier I couldn't think of a more clear reason to demand it you mentioned coinbase they're in G Dax out there in San Francisco headed up by Brian Armstrong this has been a tension in the crypto community for a while because you've got the corporate crypto community you've got for example coinbase you've got bitpay you've got other big corporations who are tied in with VC money they're looking for exit strategies they're looking for quick profits this has been a bit of a tension because on the other hand there's a part of the community I guess you could call it the cypherpunk community going back to the origins of Bitcoin and the technology that came out of the cyberpunk movement and so these two are not pitted against each other in a new on one hand you could say this has been going on for our since the creation of Bitcoin this has always been tension there but secondarily or in another way the questions got to be asked if in fact we're recreating all the problems we had with Wall Street all over again what's the prognosis for Bitcoin will it get through this latest drama will your thoughts on that you know you talk about conflict of interest one of the investors in Pitt pays Roger ver Roger ver pumps be cash heart he holds a majority of his savings in B cash so he says publicly and it would match with clothing that he wears which is always a B CH please shirt used to be a Bitcoin shirt you know Bitcoin Jesus turned into Bitcoin Judas now the only things he says about Bitcoin are negative and demeaning just pretty insulting based on the fact that his little get rich quick project is built on the hard work and effort and labor of the Bitcoin coders that built it you know when he stole their work or is benefiting from their work when he forked it and didn't just take the code took the name took the logo and so now we don't have that problem just with Roger ver we also have that problem with Brian Armstrong coinbase he doesn't like Bitcoin he holds a majority of his wealth and aetherium so I hear and every time you hear him speak about that coin versus aetherium he says you got to go where the developers are going which i think is pretty funny because that's where the developers are going to lose money that's where they get lured into a honey trap of making buggy smart contracts that lose millions of dollars it's much harder to make buggy smart contracts in Bitcoin that lose millions of dollars because we've purposely restricted the attack surface so it's harder to screw up and lose money so less money is lost well Brian Armstrong one of the you know the CEO of the biggest on border in the United States right now doesn't like Bitcoin so much so he has an implemented segue which gives us twice the processing power and you know more security transaction mail abilities cured a sick boost has cured all these good things that came from Sega being implemented you know Brian Armstrong's team doesn't do and his team also doesn't improve the Bitcoin protocol no one on his developer team makes any improvements to Bitcoin well that's pretty terrible you know when they're a core product that they sell the most of which is Bitcoin he speaks negatively about publicly and his team does nothing to improve and he rolls in the diss copy this terrible copy that doesn't even have seg wit it's bad and it's all conflict of interests and you know I I would be happy to see a financial regulator or the directors of coinbase replace him asiya because I do not believe he is treating their core product fairly and if you saw this most recent launch of the B cache token surprise release which wrecked a lot of people's entire wealth you know life savings lost I don't it doesn't seem like the kind of guy that should be in charge of a billion dollar endeavor let's for a moment here talk about what your view is about let's say bitcoins push back I mean what what's happening on the other side of the equation we have continued adoption continued awareness where do you see where do you give me some good news on Bitcoin you know Bitcoin is the only product that has good legal backing so there's laws which specifically named Bitcoin that allow you to get good bank earning relationships with it to get custodial services for instance through Gemini where a larger institution could purchase a bunch of Bitcoin and have a licensed insured bonded reason to believe it wouldn't get stolen or hacked other cryptocurrencies don't have that we also have the CM II futures largest market in the entire planet by the CBOE which does about a quarter of the volume which is still quite amazing we have the best developers in the entire world working on this we've got first mover advantage the greatest liquidity the most secure platform software that you know isn't buggy really works doesn't have emergency down targeting problems like the fake imposters have had and you know we do have some problems we have a unit bias problem where you people want to own a single coin of a thing and since Milly bits isn't popular they choose things like like coin or be cash because they're cheaper and you know that puts Bitcoin at a disadvantage on a product like coin base where people just want to buy they just want to get in they don't have time to figure out what's good and why so they just click market buy and you know they got they used to have three products there they could market by now they've got fourth product unfortunately the worst possible product you could add or close and it's gonna be a fight you know if Wall Street wants to step in and start long in the futures the bitcoins gonna you know take more dominance and the old coins will die more Wall Street doesn't want to step in and start long in that futures contract and take advantage of the new cool institutional relationships then I think the all coins are gonna pump and people are gonna take advantage of that units bias and try and get that next you know smaller market cap easier to pump coin that might give them a higher percentage return it's gonna be a fight so Richard you've been in the game since I believe 2011 we started covering Bitcoin in 2011 you know we've been in it almost from the inception we've seen more than once at least three or four times massive corrections in the space 50 60 70 percent ninety percent in one case where are we on the timeline there do you I mean first of all I guess it's all right instead of asking you that question let me ask you this can you stick around for a second segment and we'll get into that in a second segment yeah I love it anyway thanks for being on this segment Richard Hart and that's gonna do it for this edition of the Kaiser report with me max Kaiser and Stacy Herbert I'd like to thank our guest Richard Hart he's got an outstanding YouTube channel check it out if you want to catch us on Twitter it's Kaiser report until next time bye y'all you
