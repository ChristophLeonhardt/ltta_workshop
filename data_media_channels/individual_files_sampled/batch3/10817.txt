Jamal Kershaw gee I can't say it you can't spill it and a week ago most of us had never heard of him but in case you missed it he is suddenly become the biggest story in the world exiled Saudi journalist Jamal khashoggi walked into the Saudi consulate in Istanbul and didn't come out at least not in one piece we think there are allegations of murder dismemberment by Saudi hit squads bone saws and a gruesome audio recording of it all going down many are asking the question how could this possibly happen to a high-profile exile who's been writing critical stories about the Saudi regime for The Washington Post ever since Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman tried to silence him your guess is as good as mine although Trump thinks it could be some rogue killers lucky me the US has said that the Saudis will carry out a full investigation into what happened in their own consulate that should put minds at ease others are wondering why Turkey's President Erdogan who's not particularly known for his love of critical journalists retaining their life and Liberty happens to be so upset about this particular journalist who happens to be one of his closest friends we just don't know what we do know is that this situation is proving a little awkward for some people it risks uncovering one of the biggest secrets in geopolitics and that is that everyone is a fucking hypocrite for the West this is all one big pain in the backside there's a dead journalist which they hate but a big fat bucket load of Saudi cash which they love it's a choice between the basic human right to keep breathing and government's desire to keep selling murderous weapons to despots that's a no brainer we can expect the US and Europe to impose wide-ranging sanctions on Saudi Arabia any day now then there's the dip so Saudi leader Mohammed bin Salman or MBS which is the BS nickname he's picked up his attempt at rebranding himself as a cuddly reformer appears to be severely hampered by all the killing he's been ordering allegedly you know who's really angry though Yemen one Khashoggi gets more headlines than thousands of Yemeni civilians killed by the Saudi regime make friends with the president right for The Washington Post then people will care
