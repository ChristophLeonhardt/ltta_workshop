and you thought that door-to-door salesman Hawking energy contracts were skilled in the fine art of double-talk well these guys are mere ham and Egger is compared to progressive politicians people who simply can't answer the simplest question by employing a straight answer last month ex Ontario Premier Kathleen Wynne achieved a new pinnacle in that which is known as doublespeak remember this whopper sorry not sorry you know what sorry not sorry really means it means not sorry if you don't believe me next time you get into a tiff with your significant other and you're thinking about kissing and making up just try saying sorry not sorry as your Mia culpa for if you do you shall remain in a state of domestic warfare but speaking with a forked tongue achieved a new benchmark recently thanks to new baffle gab off authored by former President Bill Clinton mr. Clinton was interviewed by NBC's Craig Melvin and the thorny I said thorny issue of Monica Lewinsky came up after touching upon how things have radically changed visa vie sexual harassment due to the me2 movement Melvin asked Clinton if he's ever personally apologized to Lewinsky here's Melvin's question verbatim and Clinton's absolutely bizarre answer did you ever apologize yes did you catch that bill actually answered the question with no yes that's what I heard here let's play it again did you ever apologize and no yes and who talked about the fast and the curious but if there's anything at Clinton excels at its the arts of meaningless fast talk and what does it all mean no yes like it's a new word in the lexicon sort of like a hybrid of maybe and it's just as useless to I mean next time you're at McDonald's and you're asked if you want fries with that quarter pounder just say no yes all you're gonna do is piss off a lot of hungry people by unnecessarily holding them up in the line and whereas sorry not sorry was something to behold no yes takes baffle gab to a whole new level of course speaking of that Lewinsky girl we all remember Clinton's original answer in 1998 20 was asked if he had a sexual affair with her I did not have sexual relations with that woman miss Lewinsky caught red-handed right so well not so fast folks because you see through the lens of revisionist history here's how we now dissect that statement clinton-style here goes first sentence I did not have sexual relations period full stop now new sentence with that woman Sammy : miss Lewinsky beginning of an incomplete sentence so you see joke's on us folks bill never lied you thought that statement was simply a run-on sentence one sentence but it clearly wasn't you see grammarians know full well that it's all about the art of punctuation and the precise order of words and as the great George Carlin once said you can prick your finger but don't finger your prick by the way kudos to mr. Melvin for later in the interview trying yet again to get a straight answer regarding that personal apology thingy to Lewinsky but they don't call Clinton Slick Willy for nothing you are giving one side and omitting mr. president I'm not I'm not trying to present aside no no you asked me if I agreed the answer is no I know and I asked if you'd ever apologize and you said you had I have you've apologized I apologize to everybody in the world you got that folks mr. Clinton says he publicly apologized to everybody in the world and because Miss Lewinsky is indeed a resident of planet Earth therefore his statement can be clearly interpreted as a personal apology do I make myself clear as an unwanted light Fred as clear as an azure sky of deepest summer in the meantime all these years later Bill Clinton remains as slippery as Teflon slathered in wd-40 and chin up ex-premier win look on the bright side next to ex-president Bill Clinton you could probably get away with adopting the nickname Honest Kathleen for the rabble dot media I'm David the men's Oy menzies hey folks you may have heard the rebel has a brand new app please download that app and take the rebel with you wherever you go you
