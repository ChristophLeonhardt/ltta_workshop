27
00:00:38,714 --> 00:00:43,218
SO FAR, IT IS JUST A RUMOR.

THERE IS NO QUESTION ABOUT IT.

50
00:01:20,690 --> 00:01:22,924

PERSONALLY.

81
00:02:17,013 --> 00:02:18,880
THAT WILL NOT BE SOMETHING THAT

I AM CONSIDERING CHANGING THE

89
00:02:27,923 --> 00:02:28,723
IMMIGRATION LAWS.

90
00:02:28,724 --> 00:02:30,291
WE HAVE THE WORST, AS THE

91
00:02:30,292 --> 00:02:32,327
GOVERNOR CAN TELL YOU, AS

92
00:02:32,328 --> 00:02:33,928
EVERYBODY CAN TELL YOU, FROM

93
00:02:33,929 --> 00:02:35,330
YOUR TIME AS GOVERNOR.

94
00:02:35,331 --> 00:02:38,700
WE HAVE THE WORST IMMIGRATION

95
00:02:38,701 --> 00:02:40,602
LAWS AND THE DUMBEST IMMIGRATION

96
00:02:40,603 --> 00:02:41,903
LAWS IN THE HISTORY OF THE

97
00:02:41,904 --> 00:02:42,203
WORLD.

98
00:02:42,204 --> 00:02:43,671
THERE IS NO COUNTRY IN THE WORLD

99
00:02:43,672 --> 00:02:45,974
THAT HAS SUCH STUPID LAWS AS WE

100
00:02:45,975 --> 00:02:46,241
DO.

101
00:02:46,242 --> 00:02:47,776
SOMEBODY COMES INTO OUR COUNTRY.

102
00:02:47,777 --> 00:02:50,812
THEY PUT ONE FOOT ON OUR LAND

103
00:02:50,813 --> 00:02:52,213
AND WE HAVE TO BRING THEM

104
00:02:52,214 --> 00:02:53,581
THROUGH A LONG COURT PROCESS OR

105
00:02:53,582 --> 00:02:55,150
WE HAVE CATCH AND RELEASE, WHICH

106
00:02:55,151 --> 00:02:56,084
IS EVEN WORSE.

107
00:02:56,085 --> 00:02:57,118
WE CATCH THEM.

108
00:02:57,119 --> 00:02:59,687
WE CATCH THEM, WE FIND OUT THEY

109
00:02:59,688 --> 00:03:00,455
ARE A CRIMINAL.

110
00:03:00,456 --> 00:03:01,756
WE WRITE THEM UP.

111
00:03:01,757 --> 00:03:03,258
THEN, WE RELEASE THEM AND TELL

112
00:03:03,259 --> 00:03:04,859
THEM TO COME BACK IN THREE, FOUR

113
00:03:04,860 --> 00:03:06,127
YEARS FOR A COURT CASE.

114
00:03:06,128 --> 00:03:08,463
THEY NEVER SHOW UP.

115
00:03:08,464 --> 00:03:09,931
WE HAVE THE DUMBEST HERE BECAUSE

116
00:03:09,932 --> 00:03:12,534
OF THE DEMOCRATS, BECAUSE THEY

117
00:03:12,535 --> 00:03:14,402
WANT TO HAVE THESE LAWS THAT

118
00:03:14,403 --> 00:03:14,669
WAY.

119
00:03:14,670 --> 00:03:15,637
IT IS SO CRAZY.

120
00:03:15,638 --> 00:03:17,238
WE ARE GETTING THEM CHANGED ONE

121
00:03:17,239 --> 00:03:17,806
BY ONE.

122
00:03:17,807 --> 00:03:20,041
WE ARE VERY TOUGH ON THE BORDER.

123
00:03:20,042 --> 00:03:21,176
WE HAVE TO BE.

124
00:03:21,177 --> 00:03:22,544
WE ARE LOOKING AT ALL

125
00:03:22,545 --> 00:03:23,311
IMMIGRATION LAWS.

126
00:03:23,312 --> 00:03:25,780
THEY ARE A DISASTER, A LAUGHING

127
00:03:25,781 --> 00:03:26,848
STOCK ALL OVER THE WORLD.

128
00:03:26,849 --> 00:03:28,883
THIS COUNTRY WILL NEVER BE A

129
00:03:28,884 --> 00:00:00,000
LAUGHING STOCK WHEN I'M RUNNING
