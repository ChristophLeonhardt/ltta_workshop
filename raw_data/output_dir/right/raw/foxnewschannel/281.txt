1
00:00:05,472 --> 00:00:06,973
>> Tucker: WHY ARE SO MANY YOUNG

2
00:00:06,974 --> 00:00:08,841
PEOPLE SO ANGRY?

3
00:00:08,842 --> 00:00:11,544
IT'S MOSTLY ECONOMICS.

4
00:00:11,545 --> 00:00:14,046
ERIC WEINSTEIN GOT THE CORE OF

5
00:00:14,047 --> 00:00:14,313
IT.

6
00:00:14,314 --> 00:00:15,815
HE SAID A YOUNG BREAD WINNER

7
00:00:15,816 --> 00:00:17,850
NEEDS TO BY A REASONABLY PRICED

8
00:00:17,851 --> 00:00:21,354
HOME IN A DECENT TOWN WITH MANY

9
00:00:21,355 --> 00:00:22,555
OPPORTUNITIES AND PROVIDE FOR A

10
00:00:22,556 --> 00:00:25,892
SECOND PARENT TO STAY HOME AND

11
00:00:25,893 --> 00:00:26,826
RAISE YOUNG CHILDREN.

12
00:00:26,827 --> 00:00:29,896
A NATION CANNOT PROVIDE

13
00:00:29,897 --> 00:00:31,430
SUFFICIENT OPPORTUNITIES FOR

14
00:00:31,431 --> 00:00:33,166
YOUNG FOLKS TO TEND TO THE

15
00:00:33,167 --> 00:00:34,834
RAISES OF KIDS, WE HAVE

16
00:00:34,835 --> 00:00:35,201
PROBLEMS.

17
00:00:35,202 --> 00:00:37,136
WE DO.

18
00:00:37,137 --> 00:00:39,071
WE ORIGINALLY TALKED TO BRAD

19
00:00:39,072 --> 00:00:40,873
WILCOX FROM THE NATIONAL

20
00:00:40,874 --> 00:00:42,742
MARRIAGE PROJECTS ABOUT THIS.

21
00:00:42,743 --> 00:00:45,011
>> THANK YOU FOR COMING ON.

22
00:00:45,012 --> 00:00:47,813
AS I WATCH THE PERENNIAL

23
00:00:47,814 --> 00:00:49,348
POPULARITY OF SOCIALISM COME

24
00:00:49,349 --> 00:00:51,617
BACK, PEOPLE MY AGE THINK

25
00:00:51,618 --> 00:00:52,251
SOCIALISM?

26
00:00:52,252 --> 00:00:52,585
REALLY?

27
00:00:52,586 --> 00:00:55,855
WHAT IS THE APPEAL.

28
00:00:55,856 --> 00:00:57,924
WHAT COULD BE THE APPEAL?

29
00:00:57,925 --> 00:01:00,226
I SEE NUMBERS LIKE THESE AND SAY

30
00:01:00,227 --> 00:01:03,696
IF WE DON'T FIX THEM, WE'LL GET

31
00:01:03,697 --> 00:01:04,063
SOCIALISM.

32
00:01:04,063 --> 00:01:05,831
>> A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE CONCERNED

33
00:01:05,832 --> 00:01:08,834
ABOUT THINGS LIKE HEALTHCARE,

34
00:01:08,835 --> 00:01:11,237
EMPLOYMENT, DEBT AND THEY SEE

35
00:01:11,238 --> 00:01:12,939
THE GOVERNMENT AS A GOOD PLACE

36
00:01:12,940 --> 00:01:15,875
FOR THEM TO SEE GREATER SECURITY

37
00:01:15,876 --> 00:01:17,276
GIVEN THE BROADER CONTEXT WE'RE

38
00:01:17,277 --> 00:01:18,211
SEEING TODAY IN AMERICA.

39
00:01:18,212 --> 00:01:20,079
>> I WANT TO ZERO IN ON

40
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:20,446
MARRIAGE.

41
00:01:20,447 --> 00:01:21,747
I KNOW YOU FOLLOW THAT.

42
00:01:21,748 --> 00:01:25,218
YOU STUDY IT CLOSELY.

43
00:01:25,219 --> 00:01:27,954
MARRIAGE IS AMONG MANY OTHER

44
00:01:27,955 --> 00:01:30,156
THINGS AN INDICATOR AND CAUSE OF

45
00:01:30,157 --> 00:01:30,556
PROSPERITY.

46
00:01:30,557 --> 00:01:32,291
MARRIED PEOPLE WITH KIDS TEND TO

47
00:01:32,292 --> 00:01:33,659
BE MORE ECONOMICALLY STABLE.

48
00:01:33,660 --> 00:01:35,995
WHAT CAN WE DO TO REVERSE THE

49
00:01:35,996 --> 00:01:37,196
TREND THAT IS CAUSING YOUNG

50
00:01:37,197 --> 00:01:39,899
PEOPLE TO DELAY OR AVOID

51
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:40,499
MARRIAGE ENTIRELY?

52
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:42,735
>> WELL, YOU KNOW, THERE'S A

53
00:01:42,736 --> 00:01:44,270
COUPLE THINGS THAT WE CAN DO.

54
00:01:44,271 --> 00:01:46,138
ONE THING WE CAN DO IS GET RID

55
00:01:46,139 --> 00:01:47,573
OF THE MARRIAGE PENALTIES THAT

56
00:01:47,574 --> 00:01:50,076
FACE YOUNGER ADULTS AND POORER

57
00:01:50,077 --> 00:01:52,712
ADULTS AND THINGS LIKE MEDICAID,

58
00:01:52,713 --> 00:01:55,414
THE EIPC FOOD STAMPS.

59
00:01:55,415 --> 00:01:58,217
WE CAN ALSO DO MORE TO THINK

60
00:01:58,218 --> 00:02:01,854
ABOUT THINGS LIKE DOING MORE

61
00:02:01,855 --> 00:02:03,155
SUBSIDIZED WORKING CLASS WAGES

62
00:02:03,156 --> 00:02:04,991
AND I ALSO THINK WE HAVE TO

63
00:02:04,992 --> 00:02:06,559
THINK ABOUT THE CULTURAL CONTEST

64
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:07,627
THAT WE'RE LIVING IN.

65
00:02:07,628 --> 00:02:10,496
THINK ABOUT WAYS THAT WE CAN

66
00:02:10,497 --> 00:02:12,398
MAKE MARRIAGE BOTH MORE

67
00:02:12,399 --> 00:02:14,433
APPEALING AND THE POP CULTURE

68
00:02:14,434 --> 00:02:17,236
AND TO THINK ALSO ABOUT WAYS

69
00:02:17,237 --> 00:02:20,106
THAT WE CAN DO MORE TO SPEND

70
00:02:20,107 --> 00:02:22,408
TIME IN PERSON AND LESS TIME

71
00:02:22,409 --> 00:02:24,043
ONLINE.

72
00:02:24,044 --> 00:02:27,313
LOOKS LIKE JOHN CULTURE IS

73
00:02:27,314 --> 00:02:28,914
PLAYING A BIG ROLE IN THE

74
00:02:28,915 --> 00:02:31,117
RE-RITA FOR MARRIAGE AND THE

75
00:02:31,118 --> 00:02:33,219
RETREAT FOR FERTILITY IN THE

76
00:02:33,220 --> 00:02:33,853
U.S.

77
00:02:33,854 --> 00:02:40,526
>> ALL OF US HAVE AN INTEREST IN

78
00:02:40,527 --> 00:02:40,826
THIS.

79
00:02:40,827 --> 00:02:44,096
MARRIED KIDS ARE NOT CALLING FOR

80
00:02:44,097 --> 00:02:45,264
ANTIFA.

81
00:02:45,265 --> 00:02:46,432
A COUNTRY WITH A LOT OF

82
00:02:46,433 --> 00:02:47,867
UNMARRIED PEOPLE IS A VOLATILE

83
00:02:47,868 --> 00:02:48,200
COUNTRY.

84
00:02:48,201 --> 00:02:49,869
WHY DON'T OUR POLICY MAKERS TAKE

85
00:02:49,870 --> 00:02:50,903
THIS SERIOUSLY?

86
00:02:50,904 --> 00:02:54,140
>> YOU KNOW, I THINK A LOT --

87
00:02:54,141 --> 00:02:56,275
PEOPLE THINK OF MARRIAGE AS A

88
00:02:56,276 --> 00:02:59,178
PRIVATE ISSUE AND THE GOVERNMENT

89
00:02:59,179 --> 00:03:00,813
CANNOT AND SHOULDN'T DO ANYTHING

90
00:03:00,814 --> 00:03:02,281
ABOUT MARRIAGE AND FERTILITY.

91
00:03:02,282 --> 00:03:03,516
THEY DON'T SEE WHAT HAPPENS IN

92
00:03:03,517 --> 00:03:05,418
OUR FAMILIES AS A LOT TO DO WITH

93
00:03:05,419 --> 00:03:07,053
WHAT IS HAPPENING IN OUR

94
00:03:07,054 --> 00:03:08,321
COMMUNITIES AND IN OUR COUNTRY

95
00:03:08,322 --> 00:03:09,355
MORE GENERALLY.

96
00:03:09,356 --> 00:03:11,691
>> Tucker: EXACTLY.

97
00:03:11,692 --> 00:03:13,025
THAT'S AN OBVIOUS POINT.

98
00:03:13,026 --> 00:03:14,860
WHY ISN'T EVERYBODY SAYING THAT?

99
00:03:14,861 --> 00:03:17,763
WHY DO WE IGNORE THIS AS A CAUSE

100
00:03:17,764 --> 00:03:19,799
OF SOCIAL VOLATILITY?

101
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:21,300
VOLATILITY WRECKING THE COUNTRY?

102
00:03:21,301 --> 00:03:22,835
WHY DOES NOBODY SAY THAT?

103
00:03:22,836 --> 00:03:24,937
>> I THINK IT'S OBVIOUSLY --

104
00:03:24,938 --> 00:03:26,639
THINGS RELATED TO DIVORCE AND

105
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:27,740
SINGLE PARENTING COMPETITIONS

106
00:03:27,741 --> 00:03:29,342
ARE SENSITIVE FOR A LOT OF US.

107
00:03:29,343 --> 00:03:33,579
WE KNOW PEOPLE HAVE BEEN IN

108
00:03:33,580 --> 00:03:34,480
DIFFICULT SITUATIONS.

109
00:03:34,481 --> 00:03:37,016
THERE'S A RELUCTANCE TO ENGAGE.

110
00:03:37,017 --> 00:03:38,184
THE SCIENCE IS CLEAR.

111
00:03:38,185 --> 00:03:40,519
WE'VE SEEN WORK AT HARVARD THAT

112
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:42,655
INDICATES WE'RE IN THE BEST

113
00:03:42,656 --> 00:03:44,256
PREDICTORS OF MOBILITY FOR POOR

114
00:03:44,257 --> 00:03:46,158
KIDS IN COMMUNITIES ACROSS THE

115
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:47,560
COUNTRY IS THE SHARE OF TWO

116
00:03:47,561 --> 00:03:51,664
PARENTS IN A COMMUNITY.

117
00:03:51,665 --> 00:00:00,000
>> Tucker: OF COURSE IT IS.
