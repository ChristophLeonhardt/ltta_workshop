>> Shannon: DOUG McKELWAY

2
00:00:01,549 --> 00:00:03,917
LIVE AT THE WHITE HOUSE.

3
00:00:03,918 --> 00:00:05,085
THANK YOU.

4
00:00:05,086 --> 00:00:06,086
BIG GAMBIT FOR DEMOCRATS

5
00:00:06,087 --> 00:00:07,654
CARRYING ON THE FIGHT AND EVEN

6
00:00:07,655 --> 00:00:08,689
DISCUSSING IMPEACHMENT

7
00:00:08,690 --> 00:00:10,090
SUPREME COURT JUSTICE BRETT

8
00:00:10,091 --> 00:00:12,259
KAVANAUGH.

9
00:00:12,260 --> 00:00:14,695
>> WE SEEK TRUTH TO SET THE

10
00:00:14,696 --> 00:00:15,996
RECORD STRAIGHT, YES.

11
00:00:15,997 --> 00:00:19,333
THAT DOES NOT MEAN WE'LL BE

12
00:00:19,334 --> 00:00:19,900
MAKING A PRIORITY OF

13
00:00:19,901 --> 00:00:20,467
IMPEACHMENT.

14
00:00:20,468 --> 00:00:21,702
>> DEMOCRATS ARE SHOOTING

15
00:00:21,703 --> 00:00:22,469
THEMSELVES IN THE FOOT.

16
00:00:22,470 --> 00:00:25,038
WE OUGHT TO BE MOVING FORWARD.

17
00:00:25,039 --> 00:00:26,940
LET'S CHARGE JUSTICE KAVANAUGH

18
00:00:26,941 --> 00:00:30,210
ON HIS PERFORMANCE AS A JUSTICE

19
00:00:30,211 --> 00:00:32,279
ON THE SUPREME COURT.

20
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:33,680
>> Shannon: LET'S BRING IN

21
00:00:33,681 --> 00:00:35,082
GEORGE WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY

22
00:00:35,083 --> 00:00:35,749
CONSTITUTIONAL LAW PROFESSOR

23
00:00:35,750 --> 00:00:36,216
JONATHAN TURLEY.

24
00:00:36,217 --> 00:00:36,917
GOOD TO SEE YOU.

25
00:00:36,918 --> 00:00:41,121
WHAT YOU MAKE OF THIS DISCUSSIO

26
00:00:41,122 --> 00:00:41,888
DISCUSSION?

27
00:00:41,889 --> 00:00:43,890
BAD OR GOOD TO DISCUSS

28
00:00:43,891 --> 00:00:44,291
IMPEACHMENT?

29
00:00:44,292 --> 00:00:45,692
>> IT'S TERRIBLE ADVICE.

30
00:00:45,693 --> 00:00:47,494
THERE HAS TO BE SOME FINALITY IN

31
00:00:47,495 --> 00:00:48,262
THE SYSTEM.

32
00:00:48,263 --> 00:00:49,896
THERE SHOULD BE RESPECT FOR THE

33
00:00:49,897 --> 00:00:50,297
INSTITUTION.

34
00:00:50,298 --> 00:00:52,666
IF THE DEMOCRATS WANT TO CREATE

35
00:00:52,667 --> 00:00:54,034
THIS MONSTER, THEN THEY HAVE TO

36
00:00:54,035 --> 00:00:55,702
WONDER HOW THEY'RE GOING TO

37
00:00:55,703 --> 00:00:57,104
CONTROL IT.

38
00:00:57,105 --> 00:00:58,405
THERE WERE ALLEGATIONS ELENA

39
00:00:58,406 --> 00:00:59,539
KAGAN WAS NOT ENTIRELY TRUTHFUL

40
00:00:59,540 --> 00:01:01,708
IN HER TESTIMONY, BUT PEOPLE

41
00:01:01,709 --> 00:01:02,709
DIDN'T CALL FOR INVESTIGATION

42
00:01:02,710 --> 00:01:03,744
AND HER IMPEACHMENT.

43
00:01:03,745 --> 00:01:06,280
AT SOME POINT, YOU'RE DOING

44
00:01:06,281 --> 00:01:07,748
SERIOUS HARM TO THE VERY

45
00:01:07,749 --> 00:01:08,448
FOUNDATIONS OF OUR SYSTEM AND

46
00:01:08,449 --> 00:01:11,685
THAT'S WHAT'S HAPPENING HERE.

47
00:01:11,686 --> 00:01:13,520
IF EVERY CONFIRMATION CAN BE

48
00:01:13,521 --> 00:01:15,289
REDONE WHEN A MAJORITY SHIFTS,

49
00:01:15,290 --> 00:01:16,356
THEN WERE GOING TO LOSE THE

50
00:01:16,357 --> 00:01:17,524
STABILITY THAT THE COURT HAS

51
00:01:17,525 --> 00:01:18,125
HAD.

52
00:01:18,126 --> 00:01:19,726
WE HAVE BEEN THROUGH TERRIBLE

53
00:01:19,727 --> 00:01:21,428
THINGS IN THIS COUNTRY, THINGS

54
00:01:21,429 --> 00:01:23,130
THAT WOULD BREAK A LOT OF

55
00:01:23,131 --> 00:01:24,097
CONSTITUTIONAL SYSTEMS INTO

56
00:01:24,098 --> 00:01:24,698
SMALL PIECES.

57
00:01:24,699 --> 00:01:25,465
WE HAVE SURVIVED IN PART BECAUSE

58
00:01:25,466 --> 00:01:28,902
OF THAT STABILITY AND NOT IN

59
00:01:28,903 --> 00:01:30,070
SMALL PART BECAUSE OF THE

60
00:01:30,071 --> 00:01:30,504
SUPREME COURT.

61
00:01:30,505 --> 00:01:31,238
>> Shannon: SEEMS LIKE THERE'S

62
00:01:31,239 --> 00:01:33,173
A LITTLE BIT OF SPLIT, EVEN

63
00:01:33,174 --> 00:01:34,508
WITHIN THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY

64
00:01:34,509 --> 00:01:35,409
BECAUSE EITHER TOP LEADERS LIKE

65
00:01:35,410 --> 00:01:37,377
FORMER SPEAKER AND HOPING TO BE

66
00:01:37,378 --> 00:01:38,178
SPEAKER AGAIN NANCY PELOSI SAY

67
00:01:38,179 --> 00:01:39,913
THINGS LIKE THIS NOT A PRIORITY.

68
00:01:39,914 --> 00:01:41,415
IT'S NOT A TOP THING.

69
00:01:41,416 --> 00:01:42,683
CONGRESSMAN NADLER, WHO WOULD BE

70
00:01:42,684 --> 00:01:44,918
THE TOP MEMBER NOW, THE CHAIR OF

71
00:01:44,919 --> 00:01:47,754
THE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE IF THEY

72
00:01:47,755 --> 00:01:48,989
TOOK BACK THE HOUSE THAT "IT'S

73
00:01:48,990 --> 00:01:51,758
NOT SOMETHING WE ARE EAGER TO DO

74
00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:53,760
BUT THE SENATE HAVING FAILED TO

75
00:01:53,761 --> 00:01:55,529
DO ITS CONSTITUTIONALLY MANDATED

76
00:01:55,530 --> 00:01:57,164
JOB, WE ARE GOING TO HAVE TO DO

77
00:01:57,165 --> 00:01:58,965
SOMETHING TO PROVIDE A CHECK AND

78
00:01:58,966 --> 00:02:00,067
BALANCE TO PROTECT THE RULE OF

79
00:02:00,068 --> 00:02:01,868
LAW AND PROTECT THE LEGITIMACY

80
00:02:01,869 --> 00:02:03,103
OF 1 OF OUR MOST IMPORTANT

81
00:02:03,104 --> 00:02:03,537
INSTITUTIONS."

82
00:02:03,538 --> 00:02:04,604
YOU TOUCHED ON THIS.

83
00:02:04,605 --> 00:02:06,039
THERE'S A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO

84
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:09,676
THINK IF YOU CAN SOMEHOW PUT

85
00:02:09,676 --> 00:02:10,743
THIS ASTERISK OR TAINT ON JUST

86
00:02:10,745 --> 00:02:13,714
KAVANAUGH, IT RENDERS WHAT FLOWS

87
00:02:13,715 --> 00:02:14,581
FROM THE COURT POSSIBLY

88
00:02:14,582 --> 00:02:15,482
LEGITIMATE AS WELL.

89
00:02:15,483 --> 00:02:16,917
>> WHAT I AM MOST DISAPPOINTED

90
00:02:16,918 --> 00:02:19,286
IN IS THAT IT WAS NOT LONG AGO

91
00:02:19,287 --> 00:02:20,921
WHEN THERE WERE REAL

92
00:02:20,922 --> 00:02:21,688
INSTITUTIONALISTS, PEOPLE OF

93
00:02:21,689 --> 00:02:23,490
INTEGRITY IN CONGRESS, ON BOTH

94
00:02:23,491 --> 00:02:24,958
PARTIES WHO WOULD HAVE DENOUNCED

95
00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:26,293
THIS IMMEDIATELY.

96
00:02:26,294 --> 00:02:27,894
I WAS SHOCKED THAT LEADING

97
00:02:27,895 --> 00:02:29,296
DEMOCRATS DIDN'T IMMEDIATELY SAY

98
00:02:29,297 --> 00:02:29,930
NO, THIS IS WRONG.

99
00:02:29,931 --> 00:02:32,065
THIS IS THE BRIDGE WE WON'T

100
00:02:32,066 --> 00:02:32,499
CROSS.

101
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:34,701
BUT THERE SEEMS TO BE A NEW

102
00:02:34,702 --> 00:02:37,104
DEVELOPMENT WHERE WE HAVE GIVEN

103
00:02:37,105 --> 00:02:38,472
LICENSE FOR PEOPLE TO BE

104
00:02:38,473 --> 00:02:41,475
ENRAGED, TO FEEL THEY NO LONGER

105
00:02:41,476 --> 00:02:43,110
HAVE TO BE FAIR OR EMPATHETIC.

106
00:02:43,111 --> 00:02:45,312
PEOPLE HAVE TO WONDER, YOU KNOW,

107
00:02:45,313 --> 00:02:47,714
IT'S LIKE THE SAYING ABOUT

108
00:02:47,715 --> 00:02:49,416
SATURN, THAT REVOLUTIONS LIKE

109
00:02:49,417 --> 00:02:50,717
SATURN DEVOUR THEIR YOUNG.

110
00:02:50,718 --> 00:02:52,119
THE DEMOCRATS HAVE TO BE VERY

111
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:53,620
CAREFUL, IF THEY UNLEASH THIS,

112
00:02:53,621 --> 00:02:54,788
THEY MIGHT FIND THAT IT COMES

113
00:02:54,789 --> 00:02:56,456
BACK TO HOT THEM IN THE YEARS TO

114
00:02:56,457 --> 00:02:56,757
COME.

115
00:02:56,758 --> 00:02:58,125
>> Shannon: I WANT TO PLAY A

116
00:02:58,126 --> 00:02:59,760
LITTLE BIT OF WHAT NOW JUSTICE

117
00:02:59,761 --> 00:03:00,794
KAVANAUGH SAID TONIGHT, KNOWING

118
00:03:00,795 --> 00:03:02,996
THAT HE'S GOING TO BE OPEN TO

119
00:03:02,997 --> 00:03:03,930
THIS CRITICISM ABOUT BEING TOO

120
00:03:03,931 --> 00:03:04,598
PARTISAN OR POLITICAL.

121
00:03:04,599 --> 00:03:06,666
HERE'S WHAT HE SAID.

122
00:03:06,667 --> 00:03:08,802
>> MY GOAL IS TO BE A GREAT

123
00:03:08,803 --> 00:03:14,107
JUSTICE FOR ALL AMERICANS AND

124
00:03:14,108 --> 00:03:14,908
FOR ALL OF AMERICA.

125
00:03:14,909 --> 00:03:17,444
I WILL WORK VERY HARD TO ACHIEVE

126
00:03:17,445 --> 00:03:19,279
THAT GOAL.

127
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:20,947
I WAS NOT APPOINTED TO SERVE ONE

128
00:03:20,948 --> 00:03:22,816
PARTY OR ONE INTEREST.

129
00:03:22,817 --> 00:03:25,585
BUT TO SERVE ONE NATION.

130
00:03:25,586 --> 00:03:26,720
>> Shannon: I NOTICED HE SAID

131
00:03:26,721 --> 00:03:28,955
I'M GOING TO BE A MEMBER OF THE

132
00:03:28,956 --> 00:03:29,256
TEAM.

133
00:03:29,257 --> 00:03:32,259
I WILL BE A TEAM PLAYER.

134
00:03:32,260 --> 00:03:33,560
ALL OTHER EIGHT JUSTICES WERE

135
00:03:33,561 --> 00:03:34,027
THERE TONIGHT.

136
00:03:34,028 --> 00:03:35,462
>> YEAH, AND THIS IS A VERY

137
00:03:35,463 --> 00:03:36,263
CLOSE KNIT GROUP.

138
00:03:36,264 --> 00:03:37,497
THEY HAVE TO BE.

139
00:03:37,498 --> 00:03:39,499
THERE'S ONLY NINE OF THEM.

140
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:41,067
HE'S GOING TO CAST ONE OF THOSE

141
00:03:41,068 --> 00:03:41,868
MODES.

142
00:03:41,869 --> 00:03:43,570
WITH HIS WIKIPEDIA PAGE BEGIN

143
00:03:43,571 --> 00:03:44,171
WITH THIS CONTROVERSY?

144
00:03:44,172 --> 00:03:46,006
YOU BET BUT IT WON'T END THERE.

145
00:03:46,007 --> 00:03:48,508
HE'S GOING TO HAVE YEARS OF

146
00:03:48,509 --> 00:03:50,243
CASES, DECADES, THAT'S CALLED A

147
00:03:50,244 --> 00:03:50,577
LEGACY.

148
00:03:50,578 --> 00:03:52,078
IT DOESN'T REALLY MATTER IN THE

149
00:03:52,079 --> 00:03:52,479
END.

150
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:54,247
HE KNOWS THAT.

151
00:03:54,248 --> 00:03:56,883
HE WILL BE LARGELY REMEMBERED BY

152
00:03:56,884 --> 00:03:59,085
THE CASES HE WRITES, AND HE HAS

153
00:03:59,086 --> 00:04:01,288
DECADES TO DO IT.

154
00:04:01,289 --> 00:04:01,855
>> Shannon: POSSIBLY

155
00:04:01,856 --> 00:04:03,924
OVERTURNING THE CHEVRON

156
00:04:03,925 --> 00:04:05,258
DEFERENCE.

157
00:04:05,259 --> 00:04:05,959
THIS CHECK ON ADMINISTRATIVE

158
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:09,196
AGENCY IN THEIR POWER.

159
00:04:09,197 --> 00:04:10,464
>> IT'S SIGNIFICANT.

160
00:04:10,465 --> 00:04:11,865
THIS DOCKET WAS MADE FOR

161
00:04:11,866 --> 00:04:12,232
KAVANAUGH.

162
00:04:12,233 --> 00:04:14,034
IT'S A COINCIDENCE BUT HE'S

163
00:04:14,035 --> 00:04:15,368
STARTING OUT IN ALL THE AREAS

164
00:04:15,369 --> 00:04:17,404
WHERE HE IS LIKELY TO REALLY

165
00:04:17,404 --> 00:04:20,272
TAKE THE COURT IN A DIFFERENT

166
00:04:20,274 --> 00:04:22,108
DIRECTION FROM JUSTICE KENNEDY.

167
00:04:22,108 --> 00:04:23,677
CRIMINAL CASES, ENVIRONMENTAL

168
00:04:23,678 --> 00:00:00,000
CASES, EXECUTIVE POWER CASES.
