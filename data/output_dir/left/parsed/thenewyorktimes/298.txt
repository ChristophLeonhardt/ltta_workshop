NRATV is a relatively
new online platform for
the nation’s foremost gun rights
organization to disseminate its
views, from gun safety to gun
culture to, most crucially,
the politics of gun ownership,
especially around large,
mass casualty events.
What you saw happen
almost immediately
after the Florida shooting
was N.R.A. hosts on NRATV talking
about how the
mainstream media was
lying to you about the role
of the N.R.A. in the shooting.
“The headlines are nothing
short of despicable.
Look at this one: ‘Trained by
the N.R.A.,’ writes The Daily News.”
Essentially, what’s
played out on NRATV
is a political campaign
to stifle any efforts
at rewriting gun laws before
they get off the ground.
“But no new law would have
stopped this monster,
that’s a fact. We need
more good guys with guns
around because seconds
count in these situations.”
“You want to protect
our kids or not?
Or you want to jerk around?”
Interestingly, a lot of the
stories that they cover
have nothing to do
with guns at all.
“Dana, phony fake frauds are
what I call the leaders
of these women’s marches.”
“It’s an exclusive little clique
of far left Shariah apologists. ...”
If what the N.R.A. is
doing with NRATV is trying
to reach as broad an audience
possible, then they need to make
their programming tailored to
issues that aren’t as specific
and niche as guns.
“To those who bring bias
and propaganda to CNN,
The Washington Post
and The New York Times,
your time is running out.”
“You put the lies
of Colin Kaepernick
on a pedestal. You celebrate
his hatred of our police.”
It’s going to be political,
it’s going to be entertainment.
“This is it — the big final test.”
It’s going to be informative.
Sometimes a mix of
all of those things.
So one example is
this show called
“Noir,” which is hosted by
a former Navy SEAL named Dom,
who shows you various techniques
at fighting off bad guys
with your pistol.
But then, of course, it’s
also highly politically
and racially charged.
You have the element
of crime. In this case
perpetrated by an
African-American man
against a white woman.
“I would never tell
a law-abiding citizen
to outsource their personal
safety to the government
anyway.”
You know, the N.R.A.
wouldn’t talk to us
on the record for this story.
So it’s hard to know what its
reach with NRATV really is.
There’s a big potential
to reach a lot of people.
“Wave it proudly.
If people take a knee,
drown out their disrespect
with a unified roaring
chant of U.S.A., U.S.A.”
