IMPORTANT THAN SCORING CHEAP POLITICAL POINTS AGAINST A PRESIDENT YOU DIDN'T VOTE FOR. DON'T YOU THINK? THAT'S THE "ANGLE." NOW AS PROMISED MY EXCLUSIVE INTERVIEW WITH ATTORNEY FOR PRESIDENT TRUMP. RUDY GIULIANI. WE ARE JOINED BY FORMER NEW YORK MAYOR AND COUNSEL TO THE TRUMP TEAM. YOU MADE A LOT OF NEWS LAST TIME YOU WERE ON THE NETWORK. WHAT WAS THE ISSUE? REIMBURSEMENT OF PAYMENTS TO MICHAEL COHEN FOR THE STORMY DANIELS SETTLEMENT. WE FOUND OUT THE PRESIDENT DID DISCLOSE THAT. WAS THIS DONE A COUPLE OF WEEKS YES, AND THE PRESIDENT WAS AWARE OF IT AND ENDORSED A STRATEGY. WE WOULD NOT DO IT WITHOUT HIM. HE IS THE SILENT. HE HAS TREMENDOUS JUDGMENT ABOUT THINGS LIKE THIS. THEY AGREED WITH US IT HAD BEEN FULLY DISCLOSED. I HAD A LITTLE DISAGREEMENT WITH HIM BUT IT'S PETTY. I DON'T BELIEVE IT HAD TO BE EXPOSED. I SAY IT WAS AN EXPENDITURE. Laura: AND HE SAYS IT'S A LIABILITY? IT'S IMPORTANT FOR DISCLOSURE PURPOSES. WHICH WE DECIDED OUT OF CAUTION WE WOULD DISCLOSE THIS. Laura: HE SAID THAT THE PAYMENT MADE BY MR. MICHAEL COHEN IS REQUIRED TO BE REPORTED AS A LIABILITY. WE AGREE WITH THAT. HE DISCLOSED IT. WE DON'T AGREE I DON'T AGREE IT'S A LIABILITY. BECAUSE I KNOW THE NATURE OF IT. IT DIDN'T MATTER AT THIS POINT. Laura: ANOTHER FORMER ETHICES OFFICER SAID THIS IS A TANTAMOUNT TO A CRIMINAL REFERRAL. . NO IT'S NOT. YOU JUST LEAD THE LANGUAGE. Laura: ANOTHER OFFICER SAID: NO, IT'S NOT. IF IT WAS IT WOULD SAY CRIMINAL REFERRAL. THE PRESIDENT CAN'T DISCLOSE MORE THAN HE KNOWS. WE ARE VERY COMFORTABLE WITH IT AND MUELLER SHOULD BRING THIS TO A CLOSE. IT'S BEEN A YEAR. 1.4-MILLION DOCUMENTS AND INTERVIEWED 28 WITNESSES AND HE HAS NOTHING. WHICH IS WHY HE WANTS TO BRING THE PRESIDENT TO AN INTERVIEW. WE DEMAND: TELL US WHAT YOU HAVE TO GET FROM AN INTERVIEW THAT YOU DON'T ALREADY HAVE? HE HAS ALL OF THE FACTS TO MAKE A DECISION. Laura: WHY WOULD YOU AGREE TO AN INTERVIEW NOW? A LOT OF FORMER CRIMINAL DEFENSE ATTORNEYS HAVE MULLED THIS FOR SOMETIME. GIVEN EVERYTHING DISCOVERED ABOUT HOLDING BACK DOCUMENTS, WHY WOULD YOU AGREE UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES TO ALLOW PRESIDENT TRUMP TO GO THERE? THERE WOULD BE A NARROW AREA WHERE WE MIGHT AGREE IF THEY COULD TELL US WHY THEY NEED IT. THEY HAVE HIS EXPLANATIONS OF EVERYTHING AND 1.4 MILLION DOCUMENTS AND WITNESSES. IF THEY ARE GOING TO DISBELIEVE HIM, THEY ARE GOING TO DISBELIEVE HIM. THE FACT IS WE HAVE TO KNOW WHAT DO YOU WANT CLARIFIED? IF THEY TOLD US, IF WE GAVE THE EXPLANATION, THEY WOULD END IT, FINE. WE ARE TRYING TO GET THEM TO END THIS. THIS IS NOT GOOD FOR THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. THE SPECIAL COUNSEL'S OFFICE DOESN'T UNDERSTAND THEY ARE INTERFERING WITH THINGS BIGGER THAN THEM OR US. Laura: YOU SAID THERE IS A PLAN-B AND C IF MUELLER DOESN'T WRAP THIS UP. GOING INTO THE SECOND YEAR. YOU KNOW HOW MUCH TIME THIS TAKES. BILL CLINTON FOUND THAT OUT? WE WILL DEMAND AN ANSWER. WE COOPERATED BEYOND ANY OTHER PRESIDENT EVER COOPERATED. ALL OF THOSE DOCUMENTS, 1.4 MILLION AND ALL OF THOSE WITNESSES. Laura: WHAT IS THE PLAN-B AND C. FIRING MUELLER OR COMEY? NO, THEN WE START FROM DAY 1 AGAIN. WE WILL FIND OUT WHAT LEGAL REMEDIES ARE AVAILABLE TO US INCLUDING CHALLENGING A SUBPOENA. THE SAME REASON THEY CAN'T INDICT HIM. Laura: WHICH MUELLER AGREED TO TODAY. I DON'T THINK THEY AGREE TO THE PROCESS QUESTION. THE SAME REASON THEY CAN'T INDICT HIM, THEY CAN'T ISSUE A SUBPOENA TO HIM. CLINTON OPPOSED A SUBPOENA AND THEN VOLUNTARILY COMPLIED. Laura: YOUR HOLD PAL ON MSNBC SAID. THESE FOLKS CAN'T GET THEIR STORIES STRAIGHT. THEY CAN'T FIGURE OUT WHAT THEY WANT TO DO. THEY SHOULD HAVE TOLD THE TRUTH A LONG TIME AGO. MR. GIULIANI HAS BEEN LYING TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ABOUT HOW THIS OCCURRED AND WHEN IT OCCURRED. ACCORDING TO THE DISCLOSURE TODAY, IT OCCURRED BACK IN 2017. . I DON'T THINK I EVER CHANGED THAT. THE PAYMENT TOOK PLACE IN 2017. THE REIMBURSE THE REIMBURAL THE REIMBURAL W THE REIMBURAL WAS THE REIMBURAL WAS 2 THE REIMBURAL WAS 201 THE REIMBURAL WAS 2016 THE REIMBURAL WAS 2016 A THE REIMBURAL WAS 2016 AND THE REIMBURAL WAS 2016 AND T THE REIMBURAL WAS 2016 AND THE PAYMENT WAS 2017. HE WAS NOT THERE FOR IT. I DON'T THINK HE IS A REAL LAWYER. HE IS A MAKE BELIEVE LAWYER. HE HAS ALL KINDS OF LAWSUIT AND I THINK HE IS TRYING TO BAIL HIM OUT. I DON'T WANT TO TALK ABOUT HIM. I WANT TO TALK ABOUT MUELLER. AVANATI MEANS NOTHING. Laura: YOU ARE NOT WORRIED ABOUT COHEN? NOT A LICK. IT'S ONLY ABOUT MUELLER GETTING THE DARN THING OVER WITH. HE OWES THAT TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. Laura: THE HEAD OF THE LEFT LEANING ETHICES GROUP, COMMITTEE FOR RESPONSIBLE ETHICES IN WASHINGTON, SAID, BECAUSE WE JUST LEARNED ABOUT THIS LIABILITY RECENTLY, THAT THE PRESIDENT DISCLOSED, WE WONDER WHAT OTHER LIABILITIES ARE OUT THERE. THEY ISSUED A LONG STATEMENT TODAY. THEY FILED THE ACTION THAT LED TO THE DISCLOSURE OF THE STATEMENTS. WELL, I DON'T KNOW WHAT HE IS TALKING ABOUT. I CAN'T POSSIBLY RESPOND TO ALL OF THE PRESIDENT'S POLITICAL ENEMIES. I IGNORE THEM. I THINK THEIR STATEMENTS ARE NOT WORTH ANYTHING. WHO CARES WHAT THEY SAY? Laura: HOW MANY MEETINGS HAVE YOU HAD WITH THE MUELLER TEAM? ONE. WE HAVE FIVE LETTERS WITH THEM. THREE GOING BACK TO DOWD FOR THINGS WE NEED TO KNOW. WE HAD NO RESPONSE FROM THEM. THEY BASICALLY JUST Laura: YOU ARE ASKING FOR? WHAT DO THEY REALLY NEED TO KNOW? WHAT KIND OF ASSURANCES DO WE HAVE TO GET IT OVER QUICKLY LIKE THEY DID FOR CLINTON? I WANTED TO ASK FOR THE HILLARY CLINTON TREATMENT. I WANTED THE REPORT 2 WEEKS IN ADVANCE. LAUERING LAUERING. . CLEARING MY CLIENT. NO OATHS AND JUST AN INTERVIEW AND QUESTIONS IN ADVANCE UPON WE DIDN'T GET HILLARY CLINTON TREATMENT. THE PRESIDENT WOULD HAVE BEEN EMBARRASSED. Laura: THERE IS CONCERN THAT THE DOJ IS NOT TURNING OVER DOCUMENTS UNLESS THEY ARE THREATENED WITH CONTEMPT OF CONGRESS. NUNES MALIGNED BY THE LIBERAL MEDIA. CRITICIZED FOR NOT READING SOME DOCUMENTS. WHAT IS YOUR SENSE, GIVEN YOUR BACKGROUND AS A U.S. ATTORNEY, WHAT IS GOING ON? THE ATTORNEY GENERAL HAS THE ROLE THAT ROSENSTEIN HAS NOW. I CAN'T IMAGINE NOT COMPLYING WITH A REQUEST FOR SUCH SENSITIVE DOCUMENTS WITH CONGRESS. THEY WON'T GIVE UP THE AUTHORIZATION TO PROCEED AGAINST MANAFORT OR AGAINST COHEN. WHY? JUDGE ELLIS LAID INTO THEM PRETTY HARD. WE WERE HAVING A PRETTY GOOD DIALOGUE WITH THEM. I THINK THEY ARE SHELL SHOCKED. THEY ARE THE DARLINGS OF THE MEDIA. ALL OF A SUDDEN THEIR INTEGRITY IS IN QUESTION ABOUT THE TACTICS THEY USED. INDICTING MANAFORT. 2005? THE PRESIDENT DIDN'T KNOW MANAFORT IN 2005. IF HE DID, THERE WAS NO MEANINGFUL RELATIONSHIP. Laura: THE STORY BROKEN BY THE RUSSIAN OLIGARCH VISITED BY THE FBI IN NEW YORK. HE IS ON THE SANCTIONS LIST. VISITED BY THE FBI. THEY SAID WE HAVE THIS IDEA THAT PAUL MANAFORT WAS COLLUDING WITH THE RUSSIANS FOR THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN. DO YOU WANT TO HELP US? AND A PERSON WHO CAN'T STAND MANAFORT SAID I CAN'T LIKE THIS GUY. THE IDEA THAT MANAFORT IS COLLUDING, HE LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS THEM OUT OF THE ROOM. IT DOESN'T LOOK WAS DISCLOSED.UG IT DOESN'T LOOK WAS DISCLOSED.US IT DOESN'T LOOK WAS DISCLOSED.UT IT DOESN'T LOOK WAS DISCLOSED.UE IT DOESN'T LOOK WAS DISCLOSED.U IT DOESN'T LOOK WAS DISCLOSED.UU IT DOESN'T LOOK WAS DISCLOSED.U IT DOESN'T LOOK WAS DISCLOSED.UF THE ROOM. IT DOESN'T LOOK WAS DISCLOSED. IF WE WALKED INTO A HEARING WITH THEM, I DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY WOULD NOT TELL US. I KNOW THEY HAVE PLENTY IT'S ABOUT TIME TO GET THE DARN THING OVER WITH. SAY ENOUGH. WE TORTURED THIS PRESIDENT ENOUGH. MEANWHILE, LOOK AT WHAT HE ACCOMPLISHED WITH ALL OF THIS ON HIS BACK. IT'S LIKE A BIG WEIGHT ON HIS BACK. BACK. KOREA AND CHINA. Laura: MICHAEL SAID THIS. IF THERE IS A CONFLICT OF INTEREST, IT WOULD JEOPARDIZE THE INVESTIGATION. THAT'S RIGHT. WHAT ABOUT PLACING A SPY IN THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN. Laura: DO YOU BELIEVE HAPPENED? I DON'T KNOW. Laura: DOES THE PRESIDENT BELIEVE THAT HAPPENED? I DON'T THINK WE WANT TO BELIEVE IT OR NOT. PEOPLE WHO BREAK INTO MANAFORT'S HOME IN THE MORNING IN A WHITE COLLAR CASE WHEN HE WAS PRODUCING DOCUMENTS WHO BREAK INTO COHEN'S LAW OFFICE. A LAW OFFICE. I NEVER DID THAT AND I WAS AN AGGRESSIVE PROSECUTOR. I NEVER HAD THE BENEFIT OF AN INTERVIEW TO DECIDE WHETHER TO PROSECUTE OR NOT. I DIDN'T NEED IT. THESE GUYS ARE GOING BEYOND WHAT IS NORMALLY DONE.
