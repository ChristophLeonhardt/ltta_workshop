1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,019
the Mexican officials saying that all of
the children are counted for either they

2
00:00:04,019 --> 00:00:08,400
were killed when the earthquake happened
they're saying 19 kids were killed there

3
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:12,030
11 were pulled out the others that were
in the hospital have all been accounted

4
00:00:12,030 --> 00:00:15,299
for they're with their families their
family knows where they are so they

5
00:00:15,299 --> 00:00:20,369
don't have any missing or kids who are
unaccounted for they believe that they

6
00:00:20,369 --> 00:00:25,710
may have an adult who is buried beneath
the rubble still either a teacher or

7
00:00:25,710 --> 00:00:30,359
somebody else who was at the school they
are trying to get to that person same

8
00:00:30,359 --> 00:00:34,020
way through two different ways now one
from the roof and one from the side

9
00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:37,020
trying to get down to that person and
get them assistance I want to show you

10
00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:42,750
though that the frenetic activity going
on here right now these are very very

11
00:00:42,750 --> 00:00:48,059
large very heavy pieces of Steel that
they're proving in to the area they need

12
00:00:48,059 --> 00:00:52,410
to shore up right now they've been
moving steel beams lots of wood but the

13
00:00:52,410 --> 00:00:56,489
the steel is new very large steel beams
that they're moving in there it is

14
00:00:56,489 --> 00:01:00,690
precarious work back there it is like
trying to prop up a boulder with a bunch

15
00:01:00,690 --> 00:01:04,949
of toothpicks basically there was one
part of the building that did collapse

16
00:01:04,949 --> 00:01:09,930
as they were working on it in the last
24 hours so they are going very very

17
00:01:09,930 --> 00:01:14,189
slow literally brick by brick handful of
earth by handful of earth they're

18
00:01:14,189 --> 00:01:17,820
handing it off to align a human chain of
people who are then taking it to a

19
00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:22,560
central location so it is slow
methodical and difficult and hopefully

20
00:01:22,560 --> 00:00:00,000
it will result in somebody coming out of
this alive
