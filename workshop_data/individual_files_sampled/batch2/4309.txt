I believe you have a live camera with Ronnie Jackson thanks guys I appreciate it sir you're definitely not withdrawing you're going to continue this processor Thank You Andrea I'm not sure if we're still up here or when you took that but we we had a chance to ask dr. Jackson these same questions again he gave very much the same answers that he did on arriving in senator Moran's office here for this meeting which was previously scheduled saying that he's looking forward to answering the questions that the Senators have about him and about his background but not taking the opportunity to answer any of those questions I listed off some of would have been the reported allegations against him in other news organizations he did not address any of them specifically I asked him if he would categorically deny that any of these allegations are true he wouldn't do that either but says he wants to keep going with this essentially wants to answer these senators questions although at least not in this moment in time but again sounding very much like a man who intends to continue does not intend to withdraw and again here meeting with their Republican senator on the committee that will have to approve him so doing the legwork to get past what is now this postponement of his hearing for an indeterminate period of time let's in fact play that tape of you cornering him there on the in the hallway on Capitol Hill dr. Jackson can you say anything at all about these allegations that have come out against you in the last few days now I just say that I was looking forward to the hearing tomorrow kind of disappointed that it's been postponed but I'm looking forward to getting to reschedule and answering everybody's questions you've seen the allegations a hostile work environment allegations about essentially drinking on the job over prescribing medications are you saying those are categorically untrue I'm saying I I'm looking forward to hearing so we can sit down and I can explain everything to everyone in the answer all the Senators questions no there was not thanks guys I appreciate it sir you're definitely not withdrawing you're gonna continue this processor so Garrett as you just pointed out clearly not answering the questions now but proceeding as though this nomination is going ahead this is to be to be continued this is obviously a major story a major setback for the White House today hey there I'm Chris Hayes from MSNBC thanks for watching MSNBC on YouTube if you want to keep up to date with the videos we're putting out you can click subscribe just below me or click over on this list to see lots of other great videos
