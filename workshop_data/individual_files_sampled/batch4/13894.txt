talk to my friends over at birchgold.com slash Ben slash Ben's so they know that we sent you okay so we begin today with this story that has been making the rounds on Twitter and in the news that George HW Bush supposedly sexually harassed some actresses so let me give you the information then I will and then I'll explain my my perspective on this so basically this week there's an actress named Heather Lynch whose most famously on turn where she played Abigail and she accused former President George HW Bush of sexual harassment in 2014 when Bush was 91 and already in a wheelchair Bush apologized through his spokesman on Wednesday morning saying that President Bush would never intentionally caused anyone distress and he sincerely apologizes if his attempt at humor offended miss Lynn and then they released another statement and here's the statement that they released ok quote an agent three President Bush has been confined to a wheelchair for roughly five years so his arm falls on the lower waist of people with whom he takes pictures to try to put people at ease the president routinely tells the same joke and on occasion he has patted women's rears and what he intended to be a good-natured manner some obscene and his innocent others clearly viewed as inappropriate to anyone he has offended President Bush apologizes most sincerely so dead spin of course doing the hard yeoman Lee work of reporting found out that the dirty joke that Lindh referred to in her statement went something like this apparently a tipster past word about the heather Lynn incident to Deadspin we were told that Bush had during a photo op groped her and told her that his favorite magician was David Copperfield while fondling her which I mean okay hey that's that's really is that him in any case so here that there was another actress who came out and she said that he's done the same thing where's this actress named Jordana grolnick and she was working at a main production of Hunchback of Notre Dom when Bush attended and she said we all circled around him and Barbara for a photo I was right next to him he reached his right hand around to my behind and as we smelled for the photo he asked the group do you want to know who my favorite magician is and as I felt my his hands iggins my flesh she said David coppaFeel okay so they're the reason I'm smiling is because this is all ridiculous okay so they because it's ridiculous in one sense and not ridiculous in the other I mean just the image of a 93 year old president shouting David Copperfield as you grab someone is a little bit humorous in any case there there are a couple things about this that I think are worthy of note one is President HW Bush is is George HW Bush now in the throes of dementia so he has Parkinson's disease there are there are associations between Parkinson's disease and dementia over the past eight years or so I've heard from people he has been slipping a little bit has President HW Bush and so if you go to an age old old age home people act inappropriately all the time now there's two type of old people who act inappropriately some who are actually suffering from dementia and some who just feel like screw it F it to life I'm old I can do it I want if this is the latter then I'm not gonna make excuses for this behavior because here's the reality if my wife were groped on the behind while some old guy shouted David Copperfield I would not be a happy camper and I assume neither would she now this idea that it's okay because Bush is older because he was a war hero I don't buy that if it's okay it's only okay because he was you know in the throes of dementia right if you want to say that he's not responsible for his actions then that's something I buy but this idea that it's not some form of sexual harassment for him to do that I don't buy if he is doing this out of his own free will and volition and there's no mental attitude and I will give you the case in point bringing back our old campaign shoe right I use to have a shoe on the desk or put it on the other foot if this were Bill Clinton I think Bill Clinton grabbed a woman's butt and shout at David Copperfield everyone on the right would go nuts and say right because this is Bill Clinton so there people will say right because Bill Clinton has a record of this HW doesn't that's true but that's why I suggest that maybe we ought to hold off until there's more information on exactly what hwn ttle state is but people who are making light of this I don't think that it's something that ought to be completely made light of or dismissed out of hand and people are saying that Heather Lin should be ashamed for even saying anything about it I just don't again I'm really more torn on this than I think a lot of other people are on the right okay and maybe that's an unpopular point of view but frankly I don't really care I think it's inappropriate for guys to grab girls behind and shout cop-a-feel whether they're 23 or 93 if they're can in control of their actions and just because you've done some good things in your life doesn't mean everything becomes good there's one of my chief complaints about how people gauge human beings I'll say he's a good man and then by saying he's a good man they mean everything that he does forever we have to see is good good people do bad things good people do stupid things right overall the judgment can be the person's good and the person can Dill's do still do some dumb things or still do some some bad things in any case this is case in point of sexual harassment number one from today's from today's news case in point number two is one that the left will immediately say is not sexual harassment in any way and that's because the person at issue is Ellen DeGeneres and Ellen DeGeneres is a famous in well beloved Hollywood lesbian so the reason that that is relevant her sexuality is because Ellen DeGeneres tweeted this out yesterday this is a tweet of her on Katy Perry's birthday and it's a picture of Ellen DeGeneres staring directly into Katy Perry's cleavage from about 6 inches away as her partner Portia de Rossi laughs next to her I think is Portia de Rossi correct I'm pretty sure and and then Katy Perry is kind of smiling into the camera slightly awkwardly and it says happy birthday Katy Perry it's time to bring out the big balloons right a direct reference to her breasts now let me just suggest if any man tweeted out this exact photo this exact photo if Ellen's head or Harvey Weinstein's head we would be talking about this was more evidence of sexual harassment in Hollywood Ellen DeGeneres is a very very powerful host and the fact that Katy Perry seems to be smiling here is not the issue right I mean there are plenty of pictures where Harvey Weinstein is posing with smiling women who he sexually harassed or sexually assaulted the fact is that there's a double standard with how we treat these situations and as I have been now saying for weeks we need some sort of singular standard as to what constitutes appropriate behavior and what does not Ellen DeGeneres is a lesbian which means that this is you know hurt acting upon objects of her sexual desire if a man did the same thing we would be saying this is totally inappropriate how dare he and it doesn't matter the Katy Perry smiling it just shows how toxic masculinity has infused everyone the whole point here is the double standard and double standard applies everywhere Mark Halperin it just was essentially fired from NBC News he said he resigned her took time off to spend more time with his with his genitals but in any case Mark Halperin the accusations are that he allegedly sexually assaulted up to five women sexually harassed her assaulted up to five women that he would push them up against the wall groped them press his genitals against them this is Mark Halperin the guy Road Game Change very famous reporter he's on the NBC News every day has has talked about sexual assault in the most in the most indignant of terms sexual assault is his horrible sexual harassment is horrible and then meanwhile in the back room he's grabbing he's grabbing the interns apparently this goes to show you also the the not only do we have a double standard with regard to people we like with double standard with regard to ourselves the stuff that we do we human beings have unique capacity to do this we can engage in many of the sins that we condemn other people for and the mark of a good human being is that you think enough about this to think whether in fact you are upholding the standard that you seek to promulgate that you're upholding the standard that you seek to push if you're not doing that then we all need to do better and I think we can all do better on on these scores but the reason I'm pointing out these three different scenarios the HW the ellen degeneres and the mark halperin situations is because these double standards have been in place for a very long time and we need to decide as a society what sort of behavior we are willing to accept I think the behavior should be this men do not touch women without their permission that's the behavior right we're done here and it's not the same thing if a man asks to a bar it's not the same thing if a man says that a girl is beautiful today it's not the same thing if a man says that she that he likes a girl's dress okay a woman's dress not the same thing at all we need to make some actual separations here but instead what I feel like this is devolved into is now we're just as usual conversations in America has evolved into who's the victim today and then we all come out and say it's terrible that person was victimized and then we said no standard by which we can determine whether someone is victim or not until they proclaim themselves a victim at which point we say that our victim right so if we had found out the HW Bush Heather Lin thing just through a third party source not through Heather Lind then we would have had to decide in societies there's something okay or not she declared that she was offended therefore it was bad if she had declared that she was not offended then it would have been fine hey action is not subjective when it comes to societal standards it's not subjective you don't get to decide whether an activity is good or bad for me right I as a member of society determine whether it's an activity is good or bad and I'm getting kind of tired of this routine where something is not harassment so long as I'm not offended but it is harassment if I am offended we're gonna need to draw some lines if we actually want to enforce those lines I want to talk a little bit about a little bit about another story that's that's pretty devastating out of the state of Texas yesterday and then I want to get into what I really want to talk about today at length which is the split inside the Republican Party but first I want to say thank you to our

the the DC Court of Appeals ruled that a seventeen-year-old illegal immigrant could abort her baby in the United States without going through the the hoops that Texas law requires so here is the story the seventeen year old girl jumped the border while she was pregnant and then decided to obtain an abortion under Texas law minors have to receive parental consent or judicial waiver for an abortion and Texas bans abortion after week 20 so the clock was sort of ticking here she wanted to get an abortion before week 20 so that it would be legal even though you know she jumped the border illegally and while the young woman ended up receiving a judicial waiver she then had to schedule a sonogram and consult and a consultation with a doctor which is also under Texas law they say you have to actually look at what the baby is before you kill the baby so that you are not abiding by the mythology that this is just a cluster of cells I mean this is what a 16 week old baby looks like okay when we talked about she aborted a 16 week old baby yes yesterday this is what a 16 week old baby looks like do we have that graphic yeah this is what I mean it's a human right I mean I've seen em the ultrasounds of my own children at this age to pretend this is anything other than a human baby is just to be scientifically illiterate and also block yourself from basic fact in any case she was she was kept in the detention center so she couldn't go to her appointment so she sued and the government contended that she had options for leaving federal custody right she could just go home right the Coogee they could deport her they could send her back to her home country or she could find a sponsor you know she could find somebody who's willing to take her in that would then be her legal guardian the legal guardian would give permission and then she'd be good to go but the idea that Texas law would have to change because she's an illegal immigrant that something Texas wasn't willing to do so the DC Court of Appeals instead ruled that this woman had a right to an abortion the woman immediately headed off to an abortion clinic before it could be appealed and she went and had the baby killed she said people I don't even know are trying to make me change my mind I made my decision and that is between me and God again abortion is not just a matter between you and God it's a matter as to which society has a say just as if you were to murder a baby after birth we all have a say in that that's not between you and God that's between you the babies society and God right we all have a say in this one the part of this that's really horrifying is not just you know a girl having an abortion at sixteen weeks which is inherently horrifying from any view that places the sanctity of human life at the center it's horrifying the way that some people are left responded so the ACLU tweeted this out they tweeted breaking justice prevailed today for Jane Doe she was able to get an abortion early this morning hashtag justice for Jane yay dead baby justice for Jane this is one movement that I've seen on the left that really is quite horrifying this idea that abortion is not something to be ashamed of or to be morally conflicted about it's something to celebrate that her obtaining an abortion is a victory for justice in the United States certainly not justice for the baby okay a baby at 16 weeks is about the size of an avocado it's four and a half inches long head to rump about three and a half ounces the legs are developed the head is more erect they started growing toenails the heart is pumping about 25 quarts of blood every day okay baby has an independent blood type has an independent DNA and you saw the picture I mean the baby's baby but the left celebrates nonetheless treating the u.s. as an abortion Haven should be something of which we are deeply ashamed and the idea that you come to the United States and therefore you have a right to an abortion and even if you're here illegally is is pretty astonishing to me and should be astonishing I think to a lot of other folks okay so now I want to get to the topic that has preoccupied me this morning there's an article over The Daily Beast that I find quite fascinating about the future of the Republican Party in the aftermath of Jeff Flake in the aftermath of bob Corker the aftermath of all of these people who are who are leaving the Republican Party or retiring or suggesting that it's the end of the Republican Party and all the rest of it one of the one of the theories that has been out there is that Steve Bannon and Donald Trump are now solely in charge of the Republican Party and that these people cannot be stopped that basically they run the place so say I'm Stein I so when soup saying I'm I think insects pronounce and in Lachlan Marquis have an article today out at the Daily Beast and it says establishment Republicans agree Steve Bannon is kicking our ass and say in the escalating war within the Republican Party there's one fact that both sides increasingly agree on the forces being ushered by Steve Bannon are currently winning the former White House chief strategist and chairman of Breitbart news has pledged to purge the GOP of its squishy establishment members a delineation he said extends to everyone in the Senate saved Ted Cruz which is ironic considering how Breitbart went after Ted Cruz in the primaries so far this cycle even his critics concede he's encountered like push back and then rick wilson who is an anti-trump GOP strategist he compared ban him to Isis leader Abu Bakr al-baghdadi which is a wild overstatement and say he's funded by billionaires has a shallow catchy much a message that appeals to marginally educated fanatics and the like and the idea here is that Bannon is now the force inside the Republican Party that if you oppose Trump you cannot survive on anything not just you oppose him generally you oppose him on any issue you will not survive and been and will lead the charge so I'm trying to break down this theory because I'm trying to see what exactly is true and what is not here number one there seems to be an idea after the philosophical Bandhan ISM and philosophical trumpism are on the rise this is the nationalist populist movement we've heard so much about that says that we have to close all our borders and we can't engage in trade anymore and that immigrants are not welcome here anymore and that we ought to spend enormous amounts of money on public works projects and all of this right this is the nationalist populist sort of far-right european movement and this is what's on the rise in the united states we are told i do not see the evidence of that i don't see the evidence of that the reason i don't see the evidence of that is there is a poll that's out today from the from pew or rather it's sorry yes Pew Research Center and they do a political typology looking at Fisher on the right and they break down conservatives into several different groups okay they call their their core conservatives country first conservatives markets market skeptic Republicans and new eera enterprisers so core conservatives are basically described as people who believe that the future of the country is is bright and that involvement in global economy is good because it provides the us with new markets and opportunities for growth and they believe that in get that immigration is generally a good because it's providing more people for the economy to work with and they believe that the government has already done enough on environmental regulations and they've believed that the United States has basically achieved racial parity at least in terms of law you know this is sort of the core conservative message that by far represents the largest share of politically engaged Republicans forty three percent of politically engaged Republicans are core conservatives I am a core conservative I know because they have a little quiz over a Pew Research and you can tell which one you are I am a core conservative okay so I am with the majority or at least the plurality of the of the politically engaged Republicans next to come what they call the country first conservatives these are people who are unhappy with the nation's course they're highly critical of immigration and they're wary of US global involvement so this would be the nationalist populist group it's a much smaller segment of the base according to Pew Research a much smaller segment of the base then there's the market skeptic Republicans and these are people who say banks and financial institutions have a positive effect on the way things are going in the country so these would be the these are P weather sorry the opposite most of them say that banks and other financial institutions have a negative effect on the way things are going in the country so this would be the populist okay there's a very small group and then finally you have the New Era enterprisers who are sort of open borders open trade and they say everything is great but they also want more regulations of the environment this would basically be the Jeff Flake wing of the party so when you break it down what you see is that by far the largest group by far the largest group are people core the core conservatives right the 43% of all politically engaged Republicans and then much smaller percentage our market skeptic Republicans who would be the nationalist populist and country first conservatives and then the new era enterprisers so where is the shift for Trump right if the idea was that President Trump was going to be the the guy assured in a new era of philosophy or that Bannon ISM was on the rise there's not much to actually suggest that's true there's really not much to suggest that's true right instead what it looks like is that core conservatives still are the moving force inside the party and core conservatives along with the new era and surprises along with Jeff Flake would represent 59% of the Republican Party right that is a solid majority those numbers really haven't changed so trumpism and Bandhan ISM are not a thing right there's no philosophically consistent trumpism abandon ISM the other proof of this is the fact that all of the candidates that Bannon himself has approved of don't agree with each other right so there's this idea that that bannon's philosophy is now ascendant in the Republican Party that's not true okay Roy Moore has very little in common with the ante Tarkanian the guy who who Bannon has endorsed in the Nevada Senate run they both have very little in common with Ted Cruz who apparently Bannon likes they have very little in common with Kelly Ward Roy Moore is sort of more in line with Kelly Ward than Danny Tarkanian is there's a congressman named Michael Grimm out in New York is pretty socially liberal as far as I can see and Bannon has endorsed him none of these people have anything in common right they're all over the place so why is been and endorsing them I'll explain in just a second what this suggested that Bannon is meant trumpism are not a philosophy driving the Republican Party this is why I objected to jeff flakes analysis yesterday in which Jeff Flake suggested that it's hard for a pro FreeMarkets Pro immigration Republicans get elected that is not true 59% of Republicans agree with that basic principle according to this pupil so no that's not true okay so maybe if it's not the Bandon ISM as a philosophy or trumpism as a philosophy driving the future of the Republican it's Trump or Bandhan themselves and here again I disagree the reason I disagree is because Trump went to war on behalf of Luther strange in Alabama and Luther strange lost Steve Bannon tried to take credit for Luther strange losing but the fact is Luther strange was going to lose anyway because Roy Moore was the outsider and Roy Moore was way more well known than Steve Bannon was in Alabama Steve Bannon is an afterthought in Alabama and the fact is that Stevens Breitbart didn't even back Roy Moore in the original primary in Alabama they backed mo Brooks who finished third so this idea that Bannon has some sort of outsized influence as a human being like as a person like he's the leader of a movement it's not true he's a lot of money from the Mercer's behind him but he's not somebody who's actually leading the movement he's not somebody who's crafting the movement around him and he is the great leader again there's not a lot of evidence to back any of this there's not a lot of evidence to back any of this so you know so what exactly is going on what exactly is going on here I'll explain in just a second but first I want to

they know that we sent you that always helps us okay so if it's not the trumpism and Bannen ism our dominance in a sentence if it's not that Trump himself is the moving force in the Republican Party or Bannon isn't the moving force in the Republican Party then what exactly is going on why are Trump and Bannon important figures why are we even talking about them well I think it has much more to do with the attitude than anything else what exactly unifies all of the candidates that bannon's endorsing what exactly unifies all of the candidates that Trump has backed what unifies the support for Trump it's all attitude it's a feeling from Republicans the Republicans have been squishes for too long that Jeff Flake was a squish and he was more intent on earning strange new respect from the left then he wasn't actually fighting for conservative principles this is why the right is a lot more tolerant to Ben Sasse who's very anti Trump than it is a Jeff Flake right SAS is widely perceived as somebody who's actually conservative because he is he has the third most conservative voting record in the United States Senate but we're willing to overlook you know a lot of his anti Trump rhetoric at least from supporters are because he is very conservative and because he's shown that he's willing to fight the left if you're willing to fight the left then you can fight Trump too when Trump does something wrong but if you're not willing to fight the left and it seems like all of your criticisms into is reserved for Trump people assume bad motivations and I think not entirely without cause not entirely without cause the truth is that the Republican Party has been motivated by an anti-establishment anger since 2009 long before anyone knew about Trump long before anyone knew about ban and no one cared about Trump Trump was just some guy to The Apprentice and battle is just some schmuck who walked around Los Angeles pretending he was important right Steve Danon was not a thing in 2009 in 2009 the movement started to cast out these Republican establishment types who apparently had caved to the Democrats right the Tea Party was launched in opposition to Republican establishment types Mitch McConnell was already a curse word in 2009 2010 among Republicans he was hey this is just a fact the Dave brat won defeated Eric Cantor and I think it was 2010 specifically because of this right Dave brat defeated I want to see when he was elected so sorry I guess he was elected in 2014 Dave brat defeated his the incumbent Eric Cantor in 2014 and a huge shock because this had already been a burgeoning movement Trump wasn't running been and wasn't important at that point so what exactly happened here the answer is there's a lot of anger there's a lot of anger and some of it is is proper and some of it is correct but some of it is not right some of this is some of this is not and this is the problem what is driving the Republican bus right now is the anger okay the elephant has always been anger the elephant the room has always been anger some of that time it's been directed in proper directions against Obamacare against stimulus packages against establishment Republicans who are weak but some of the time the person who has hopped up atop the elephant is leading the anger elephant in the wrong direction and the anger elephant is basically willing to go wherever there is the most anger it feeds off of anger now I wrote a piece this morning based on a George RR Martin's short story this george RR martin short story which i really like it was it was a short story called the monkey treatment and the monkey treatment is about this guy in in penny Dorchester is this obese fat guy and he wants to get skinny and one day in a restaurant he runs into a guy he used to go to a basically a Jenny Craig program with name Henry Henry Maroney and Henry Maroney is looking skinny he's a little bit gaunt but it looks like he's lost a ton of weight and so Kenny Dorchester asks Henry Maroney where'd you do this he's well you know as this place we can get the monkey treatment and so and so Kenny goes there and the monkey treatment is exactly what it sounds like it is literally a monkey it turns out to an invisible monkey he's literally a monkey that jumps on your back and then whenever you try to eat something it grabs the food out of your hand and eats it and over the course of the story the monkey continues to grow bigger and bigger it's a horror story the monkey continues to grow bigger and bigger and bigger insults its 800-pound gorilla on top of on top of his back Kenny dorchester has lost the weight but now he's basically reduced to nothing but skin and bones in the very end of the story he ends up basically throwing himself from the eighth story of a building he survives by crushing the monkey on his back and then he goes right back to eating enormous amounts of food right this is this is the basic idea the reason that I cite this story is because I think that's sort of what the anger monkey has become on the right I've said for many for for many years that I think one of the problems with anger is that anger has to be properly directed righteous indignation is a useful thing and righteous indignation is something worthwhile Andrew Breitbart wrote a book by that name being indignant being angry because something has angered you is worthwhile if it has a specific target but what is not worthwhile what is not useful is the is this misdirected anger at anything and everything and whoever seems the angriest who ever projects anger the best becomes your ally right if you if you project a swagger a machismo then somehow this is going to mean that you are a bigger fighter right this is why the he fights thing worked for President Trump it worked for President Trump because he was he was pushing that anger and so it was easy for him to hop atop the anger elephant but if the anger elephant is is if Trump goes up against the anger elephant the anger elephant wins which is exactly what happened in Alabama if Bannon goes up against the anger elephant the anger elephant wins Bannon does have a gift and so does Trump for channeling the anger elephant but they are not in charge of the anger elephant any more than the rider is in charge of the elephant of the Alpha really wants to buy him the biggest problem for conservative Republicans who oppose Trump is that they have to acknowledge that a lot of the anger is justified and then they have to channel that anger in positive directions they can't just say all anger is wrong because that's not true and they can't just say all anger is right because that's not true either that's say some anger is right and some anger is wrong and here's how I propose channeling our outrage and here's why the outrage is justified right the outrage is justified when you're talking about things against which is justified it is not justified just as a generalized sense of grievance and if we don't realize that then the anger is gonna take over the party and destroy the party the anger is going to reduce conservatism this is how Republicans treated anger in 2009 we felt like the Republican Party was fat it was morbidly obese it was lazy it didn't fight and so he took the anger Monken we put it right on the back of the of the obese Republican Party and the anger monkey immediately started eating all of the goods and that was good for a while right we were we were taking away Democratic power all across the aisle across the state legislatures we weren't in 13 governorships we were winning a thousand seats across the across the country were winning the house who weren't in the Senate all of that was good but there came a point at which we stopped depriving the anger monkey of food right we just kept feeding it and the anger monkey just kept eating and now we are being reduced to the sad sack of bones conservatism is at least when it goes up against the anger monkeys the anger monkey has to be deprived when the anger monkey is not correct and that requires us to use our reason and not just our amygdala became emotional response is not enough anymore

the anger monkey what is the proper angle to take with regard to President Trump the proper angle to take with regard to President Trump is exactly the same angle that I've used with every other president and that I used for Trump during the campaign it is the good Trump bad Trump model when Trump does bad things you criticize him heartily and when he does good things you praise him heartily but I'll tell you two things that you don't do you don't do the everything trumpet has ever done is bad because that's not true because that's not how human beings work and you know do the everyone should just shut up and ignore what Trump is doing because that's not right either when Trump does something wrong then he should be hit for it so here are the two things you should not do the first is Jeff Flake basically saying despairing of the party I can't win a primary because I'm too anti Trump because I am - glorious - wonderful the reason Jeff Flake can't win a primary is because he's perceived as an establishment squish because he moved to the left upon being elected to the Senate and then he spent the rest of his time bashing Trump without ever once lifting a finger against the left and so people perceived him as a squish but that's not the way he's gonna play it well the bottom line is if I were to run a campaign that I could be proud of and where I didn't have to cozy up to the president and his positions or his behavior I could not win in a Republican primary that's the bottom line it's it's it's not that you have to just be with the President on policy you can't question his behavior and still be a Republican in good standing apparently in a Republican primary I don't see the evidence for that at all I really don't Jeff Flake was again really implies down to 18% approval rating he was really unpopular upon being elected so that's just not factually accurate but this idea that the Republican Party has to be thrown under the bus in order to save Trump that something Trump wants you to believe in it's something Jeff Flake wants you to believe I don't think it's something that's true the other thing you shouldn't do is what Ted Cruz did here really I like senator Cruz but when Ted Cruz says you know everybody in Congress should just shut up and stop talking about Trump we've got a job to do when Trump says bad things you have to speak out because you still have moral credibility on your own right you are still an individual with the capacity to say when bad things happen regardless from from whom these bad things spring here's Cruz making this point well look I think everybody should stop bickering and engaging in just personal attacks I think should focus on doing our job that's what my focus is I'll say everyday walking down the hall of the Capitol that there is a swarm of reporters like locust that's endzone and they want to comment on so one so said this so-and-so said this and it and it's like you're back in junior high I really don't care who passed a note to the cute girls and pigtails we've got a job to do dammit and and so all of this nonsense I got nothing to say and everyone shut up and do your job okay look you should have something to say when the nonsense actually impacts policy there's some times when it's just Trump mouthing off about bob Corker or something and they're like really that's between them but when Trump says stuff that's that's actually egregious when he attacks a Goldstar Widow for example you know then then you should sound off and if you're not sounding off I think you're doing something wrong just from a moral point of view I don't think the Republican Party opposes that I don't think most conservatives oppose that I think most conservatives just want to know that you are not more interested in tearing down Trump than you are in fighting the left that's all most conservatives want to know that's all and if you're willing to do that I think you want a primary but if you are more concerned with tearing down Trump personally than you are with fighting bad stuff where wherever you see it whether it's the left or Trump then I think that you're it's gonna be hard for you to buy credibility in a Republican primary okay so in other news an FEC complaint has now been filed against the Hillary Clinton campaign this is according to media I the DNC and Hillary Clinton's campaign violated campaign finance laws by failing to accurately disclose payments related to the so-called Trump dossier the nonpartisan campaign Legal Center said in a complaint filed today with the Federal Election Commission according to recent reports in the media marquel is who also serves as the Clinton campaign lawyer paid Oppo research from fusion GPS to produce the dossier which exposed alleged connections between Trump and the Russian government it also contains salacious allegations about Trump's personal escapades so there are a couple issues that still have to be resolved as I said yesterday about the Trump dossier in order for Hilary and her team to have done anything deeply wrong okay number one you can pay for Oppo research number one you can you you can pay for Apple Research people do it all the time there are two questions one why did they lie about it right why did Mark Elias said that they had nothing to do with paying for the Oppo research number two did Hillary Clinton or on her team know that Christopher steel was being funneled information by members of the Russian government the dossier itself contains all of this okay the dossier itself byron york points this house describes one source as quote a senior Russian Foreign Ministry figure it describes another source is a form of top-level Russian intelligence officer still active inside the Kremlin dossier source II is a senior Russian financial official so this does raise questions as to whether Christopher steel was basically acting as go-between for Russian Intel that was trying to dig up dirt on Trump and then pass it through the election system in an attempt to screw up the election system if Hillary knew that was the case then it looks a lot more like the Donald Trump jr. situation right the Donald Trump jr. situation was somebody emailed him said I have a lawyer from the Russian government who wants to talk to you because Russian wants to help and Trump jr. says sounds great maybe they have Oppo that was basically the story and it turns out the Oppo didn't pass hands nothing may have come of it but it showed Trump juniors willingness to work with members people who are close to the Russian government in order to do this it is possible that's what happened here if Christopher Steele was working with the Russian government to come up with this information we don't know that and we don't know that Hillary Clinton knew that was true even if she knew that the dossier existed so those are questions that still have to be answered but the idea that that there was some sort of collusion on the other side going on is not as implausible as it was four days ago let's let's put it this way and Trump makes exactly that point here is President Trump saying the hoax is all turned around now they lost it by a lot they didn't know what to say so they made up the whole Russia hoax now it's turning out that the hoax has turned around and you look at what's happened with Russia and you look at the uranium deal and you look at the fake dossier so that's all turned around okay so one of the big questions here is whether it discredits the entire dossier that some of these allegations that were in the dossier were false or whether some of the allegations were true the reason that's important is because the FBI investigation is at least in part predicated on some of the allegations inside the steel dossier apparently some of them have actually been confirmed meetings between from officials and Russian sources for example but most of them have not right like the P tape the idea that Trump there was tape of Trump hiring prostitutes to pee on a bed that Obama and his wife slept on in Moscow or something but even people on the left are beginning to recognize that this is a problem for Hillary Clinton a New York Times reporter named Nick Conte Essaouira he said yesterday openly that this situation looks sort of like the reverse of the Trump junior Russia meeting Donald Trump jr. and another campaign officials meeting with the the Kremlin connected Russian attorney we've been reporting on that ostensibly to gather dirt on on Hillary Clinton how is this different from that it's kind of a mirror image and look you know you know parties engage in opposition research all the time admittedly this is a extreme example to hire former intelligence agency but these firms like fusion GPS are there because there is a market for them companies and trade associations pay them for this research sometimes campaign performance kind of research on their own I've gotten plenty of research documents from the RNC and their President Trump and I've gotten research documents from the DNC under Tom Perez right so the only question of separation people are trying to say that it's exactly like the Trump jr. thing the question of separation is did the Hillary Clinton campaign know that the information was coming from the Russian government did still know the information was coming from the Russian government is therefore compromised did the FBI know all of that if all those parties knew then you can actually make the case that there was some sort of collusion going on with the Russian government if you can't then you're saying that without any basis in evidence so all I'm suggesting is that we'd be objective about how we viewed the situation what the evidence says and what the evidence does not where Trump is on more solid ground is where he continues to rip on Hillary Clinton and the and the Obama DOJ and FBI for allowing the the uranium sale to Raza Tom on in 2010 this was of course the scandal in which Hillary Clinton was the head of the State Department the State Department gave the green light to the Russian Atomic Energy Agency to pick up 20 percent of all US uranium supply at the same time the FBI knew that the Barossa tom was attempting to corrupt truck drivers and engage in law breaking inside the united states meanwhile the Russian government was giving the Clinton Foundation noodles of cash here's Trump going off on that yesterday I think the uranium sale to Russia the way it was done so underhanded with tremendous amounts of money being passed I actually think that's Watergate modern age he may be right I mean it's not good I don't really like the Watergate comparison generally because there is actual evidence and hard proof but it's not it's not great stuff no it is also worth noting that everyone's hands look a little bit dirty here there's a story out today that Trump's data guru from came originally Dhaka was reaching out actively to the WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange WikiLeaks is largely assumed to be a Russian cutout for help in locating and publicizing 33,000 missing emails from Hillary's private server again this demonstrates willingness by Trump officials to reach out to people connected with Russia for information so all of this is dirty all of this is ugly the question is going to be how much of it broke the law and how much of it amounts to actual collusion with a foreign government that has interests that are opposite to those of the United States okay time for some things I like things I hate and then a very brief Big Ideas so things I like today so as I said over my vacation I read war and peace it took a while it was long it is quite good I was rereading an essay that my father showed me yesterday from commentary magazine I'm pairing them to the author of the essay on Anna Karenina Leo Tolstoy's Anna Karenina and it really is a fabulous essay explaining Tolstoy view of human relationships and why it is that Tolstoy is so gifted at getting inside people's minds to express the joy of living as opposed to Dostoevsky who is who's very focused on sort of the pain inherent in living the book Anna Karenina is a fabulous book I remember the first time I read Anna Karenina I was I think 13 and it is it I loved it then I love it now Levin who is one of the main characters of the book he's sort of a secondary character in a certain sense because the Anna Karenina does kind of love triangle with her husband and Vronsky is the is the main part of the book but Levin and his his falling in love with and Mary and Kitty presents the other part of the book Levin's discovery of why life is at the end of the book is one of the great uplifting passages in all of world literature Tolstoy is always more uplifting than dusty husky Dostoevsky is much more about looking at the fact that all of us are fallen creatures and can fall and toast is about the fact that all of us have the possibility for uplift and there's sort of two sides of the same coin in that sense Tolstoy was a very conservative guy in certain ways and when you read his books which are largely about can you find fulfillment in the sort of lasting love that comes with marriage and that comes with children and that comes with building a life together as opposed to romantic love a lot of people see Anna Karenina as the Anna's some sort of proto feminist figure a heroic proto feminist figure hemmed in by the constraints of society that's complete mystery of Anna Karenina that is not what the book is about the book is about why Anna is doing something wrong and y11 is doing something and y11 and Kitty are doing the right thing right that's what the book is about terrific book Anna Karenina and not B not because of the way the left interprets it too often okay time for some things that I hate so the thing I hate today is the use of Ivy League college to associated to dismiss everything so yesterday President Trump was being you know suggest it was suggested that he was uncivil and he was unkind and uncivil and so President Trump responded this way don't understand I went to an Ivy League college I was a nice student I did very well I'm a very intelligent person you know like the fact is I think I really believe I think the press creates a different image of Donald Trump than the real the real person I'm pretty sure that Trump creates his own image I mean he's one of the most gifted image makers in the history of American life and by the idea that this this in and of itself demonstrates a certain lack of class if you think civility is connected to intelligence you know nothing either about civility or intelligence really if you think civility class decency these things are connected to intelligence let me introduce you to all the people that I went to school with okay there are a lot of people I went to school with very high IQs I went to a junior high magnet school or he had to have an IQ above you know quote unquote genius-level IQ they give you a basic IQ test to get into this magnet school and I was at the very low end of getting in and so there were people there with IQs of 180 there were people that were thy Q's of 170 and when I remember thinking half these people are going to end up in prison and sure enough it turns out that some of them are actually in prison I can name a couple of moths out my head the reason being that intelligence and decency are not always aligned and so for Trump's respond to a question about civility and decency by saying I went to an Ivy League college is pretty ridiculous also by the way intelligent people don't have to go around on a daily basis expressing that they are very smart people that's just not something that they have to do generally I know exciting out with a lot of very intelligent people all the time Trump but this is Trump's tech you know I'm not gonna I'm not gonna fault him too much on that because this is his deal he also said yesterday he has one of the great memories of all time right like really this is what he said I was born with a certain intellect the fact is you have to be born and blessed with something up here god help me by giving me a certain brain it's this it's not my salesmanship it's what this you know that is the brain power I have like a very very high aptitude I'm pretty good at English I always did very nicely in English we like I'm a smart person I'm very good at English okay again yeah this isn't gonna turn into a riff on Donald Trump's intelligence level suffice it to say I think his own opinion of Zach he was probably inflated but but he said he has one of the great memories of all time again just showing once again that intelligence and and decency are not always aligned okay time for the big idea so the big idea today right by the way that was not again it's not a specific urban Trump there are people on the left you think the same thing they think that because they live in big cities and they're very smart that this therefore confers some sort of decency on them they're better people because of this know being a decent person means be acting decently not being smart and reading and reading a lot of navikev okay the big idea today very quickly people have been using the term trickle-down economics a lot in the media recently that's because of the tax cuts that have been proposed the idea that people at the top of the of the spectrum are gonna get a lot more of their money back than people at the bottom of the spectrum which makes sense because they're paying a lot more of their money into the government they say this is trickle-down economics and what do you think that those rich people are just gonna trickle that money down to other people no trickle-down economics is a term that was not coined by the right it's a term coined by the left the idea here is that the people at the top of the income spectrum are the people most likely to invest in new products and services why because they don't have to worry about that extra income going toward feeding their families if you have an excess of capital that excess of Capital either goes into a bank where it is lent out by the bank at risk to other places that are innovating or the rich people go and spend that money on new innovations that make your life better okay people who are spent as I've said many many times the person who's earning $40,000 a year and gets back eight hundred dollars that's great that's terrific but that $800 is not going to create an iPhone Apple getting a getting its money back is going to create an iPhone and the reason for that is because excess capital means investments in new products and the greater the the the greater the concentration of access capital the greater the possibility of that you know the the idea is not to transfer wealth from the rich to the from the poor to the rich or from the rich to the poor the point is that everybody should be able to invest in the products they see fit but the products that require the most research and the most time and expenditure are the ones that are gonna change the most lives and so the idea that we that trickle-down economics is about some rich guys spending on a yacht that's not really the suggestion the suggestion instead is that rich people having more of their own money back are likely to put it into a bank which will lend it out to other business projects or they are more likely to invest it in up-and-coming business projects because they don't have to put dinner on the table for their family okay we'll be back here tomorrow for the mailbag i'm ben shapiro this is the ben shapiro show
