THE CDC IS PLANTING SEEDS OF
DISEASE.
WE DID
THIS, LET'S GO RIGHT TO THE
PHOTO.
PEOPLE FOUND THE UTTERLY
DISGUSTING.
THEY SAID IN RESPONSE, HERE ARE
SOME TWEETS.
SORRY WE TICKED SOME OF YOU
OFF.
YOU CHEEKY BASTARDS.
THEY GOT THEIR POINT ACROSS, I
WOULD CALL THIS EFFECTIVE
COMMUNICATION.
EVEN THOUGH WE ARE NOT IN AN
AREA WHERE THERE IS A
RISK -- WE AREN'T, RIGHT?
YOU COULD GET TICKS ANYWHERE.
HERE?
I THOUGHT THERE WERE A NUMBER OF
COUNTIES.
OH MY GOD.
I DON'T KNOW IF IT'S LA
COUNTY, BUT I'M FROM
VENTURA COUNTY, THEY SPREAD
AWARENESS ABOUT TAKING YOUR
DOGS FOR A HIKE.
I GUESS THAT IT'S TIME TO
RENEW MY MORBID FEAR OF TICKS.
I'VE HAD ONE EVER SINCE THE
REAL WORLD SEATTLE.
I KNOW EXACTLY WHAT YOU'RE
TALKING ABOUT.
SHE HAD LYME DISEASE AND
YOU WATCH YOUR WHOLE LYME
DISEASE JOURNEY AND THEN
SOMEBODY JUST QUESTIONING
WHETHER SHE WAS SICK OR DISEASED
AND FROM THAT MOMENT ON, I
HAVE BEEN INSPECTING ALL OF MY
SURROUNDINGS.
GREAT REAL WORLD SEATTLE
REFERENCE.
THAT WAS LIKE SEASON THREE OR
SOMETHING.
IT WAS A LITTLE LATER THAN
THAT.
THANK YOU FOR THAT AND
ACTUALLY, MOST PEOPLE SAY THEY
GET 30,000 CASES OF LYME DISEASE
YEAR, AND IT IS ACTUALLY
CLOSER TO 300,000.
THEY DID GET THE POINT ACROSS.
ANY FURTHER THOUGHTS ON LINE
DISEASE?
I NEVER HAD LYME DISEASE,
I DON'T HAVE PERSONAL
EXPERIENCE WITH IT, BUT I AM
OKAY WITH EATING POPPYSEED
AGAIN, I AM NOT WEEK.
GOOD FOR YOU.
THEY SAID:
MAY TO JULY IS 
LYME DISEASE TAKE
SEASON, PEOPLE ARE HIKING, YOUR
DOG AND HAVE A TECH, IT IS ON
MUFFINS APPARENTLY.
TAKES ARE IN HALF OF ALL US
COUNTIES AND THEY CAN LEAD
TO ARTHRITIS, HEART PROBLEMS AND
DEGENERATIVE NERVE DISEASES.
BE EXTRA SAFE.
WE'RE DOING OUR PART TO RAISE
AWARENESS ABOUT LYME DISEASE.
