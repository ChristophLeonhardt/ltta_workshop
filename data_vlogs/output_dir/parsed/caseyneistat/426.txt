I said it before and I'll say it again
life moves pretty fast it's not about
personality matrixels and charts it's
all about the b-bumps in your heart
I stay in Mexico
Candace leaves in 55 minutes my flights

most of the morning at yes

and texts a minute that whole day was
wasted and then after 24 hours you're
like oh wait I'm on holiday all right

lot of golf party there's a lot of golf
golf starting that takes place at this
hotel

minutes our room key doesn't work she's
about to have a freakout

this fancy hotel room forever
Candace is going to get on a plane and I
have to be out by 1:00 because that's

turbulence on this plane

the fact thing you don't have to speak
or talk to or interact with a human
being when you rent a car that's how
everything should be and this is not an
endorsement of Hertz rental car you sort
of have to deal with a human she's very
nice thank you so much total sweetheart
something bad just happened
see what happened it wasn't my fault
okay it's okay I've always wanted to go
over those spiked things there was one
lucky day
you got to see this
I only blew one of four tires which
really not that bad definitely pop this
is alright ran over this thing
who that is sir yeah
not a puppet I'm oh it's flat alright
it should say this on the other side
no one else sees the humor in this but I
think it's pretty funny the gate also
crashed out in the car look at this mark
has this happened before
dad
how is that happening before and they
don't fix it you would think that all
right this is my hotel room seems pretty
nice great trip see you tomorrow
