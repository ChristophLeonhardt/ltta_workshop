dear mr. Clavin I'm a conservative teacher in the public education system I emphasize the Constitution and this applications as much as I can in my class I teach social studies by the way I have great rapport with my students and support from the majority of parents but in the last couple years I've gotten a few emails from parents insisting that I'm pushing a Republican agenda in my classroom because of my emphasis on founding documents I've always taken special care in my class to show multiple sides of issues and my students know one of the main mattresses in my class is to ask questions and filter things for yourself any advice for me moving forward well I certainly think you should address the teacher the parents who are complaining and explain your point of view I certainly think that you should let your students know that they are free to voice their opinions when you have these discussions I mean that sounds like you do that already make sure that and and make sure because you are a conservative your job is not to teach conservatives and your job is to teach the kids to think and to teach them the facts so you know do it do a searching moral inventory and make sure that these parents who are complaining don't have anything to complain about I mean it's possible you know we all make mistakes as possible that you do shade over to the right to your natural bias to the right so make sure you correct that and that you're just teaching the founding documents and what the founders thought about the founding documents and then let the students debate them from a point of being informed by your information by the fact that they now know they're not just talking about their feelings they're talking about what is actually in the documents and why they agree or disagree or whatever and you know you should so that's that's my answer you should address the parents you should look into yourself and make sure that they don't have a case and you should and you should make sure that the kids know that they can say whatever they want to say
