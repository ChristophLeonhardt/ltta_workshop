bring an Internet problem right now we're going to take a second to try and fix it so it's buffering oh there we're back thanks very much that's what happens when you go live and you never know what's going to happen in the world of live Internet and we've got about three different internet connections at the rebel here we like to have different internet connections in case one goes down I mean if you're in the internet business you really should have a redundancy and we have I think two or three thanks for your patience my point is Tommy Robbins you you you hey welcome back well I'm I apologize for that snafu there we're in a strange bunker type environment here at the rebel and we had to actually dig a trench to have a special fiber line put in to get a good internet here that was not there was still sort of rickety so we literally have three different companies providing internet to us here at the rebel and obviously the main one we relied on there went down I apologize for keeping you waiting and I am impressed the more the hundred of you stuck around through that I think you have a longer attention span than I do if I was watching something and it went dead for five six minutes that I'd I mean I I have like a five or six second attention span so I thank you very much Rover my god we're up to 200 already thank you very much wake up says extended by 11 minutes all right well I'll see I mean when we'll go a few minutes longer today thank you for sticking around and please understand that we do we do have the redundancy but it took us a while to sort of do the switcheroo there so thanks very much as I was saying that we would love to talk about things here at the rebel are one of our mottos is the other side of the story and boy when it comes to islamification and free speech we really need to hear the other side of the story don't we especially in this age of censorship when we're really seeing the merger between the alt left the postmodern marxist and the Sharia expansionist the soft jihad of of censorship that comes along with Islam the two of them have joined forces against our traditional Western values and the United Kingdom which was the source of some of these freedoms is actually shuttering itself America I think is the leading bastion of free speech in the world we in Canada somewhere between the two I don't have any news for you today about Tommy Robinson other than I see the usual suspects are bashing Morrissey the UK singer the former lead singer of The Smiths for being an independent thinker for saying he doesn't just like taurine late taury labor he wants another one party to have a chance he came out in support of a party in the United Kingdom called for Britain and his leader in marine waters the king he said that the imprisonment of Tommy Robinson Misaki I should note and I read to you some of morsi's quotes yesterday I should note that Morrissey did not even say I agree with everything Tommy Robinson says it does I mean it's almost impossible for anyone to say they agree with everything someone else does all Morris he said is that the treatment of Tommy Robinson at the hands of the court was shocking and indeed it was shocking and and we know was shocking because every media outlet in the UK left or right reported on it you don't report on unremarkable things it was truly remarkable but because Morrissey is not joining the you know five minutes of hate against Tommy Robinson he was denounced but today we're going to talk about three things that don't have to do with a good friend Tommy and that is some a little bit of news from the states and a little bit of news from here in Canada we're going to talk about Donald Trump pardoning three people I understand the Trump has pardoned a grand total of seven people in his 500 days as president and that contrast with well over a thousand people that Barack Obama has either commuted or pardoned in his eight years so Donald Trump seems to be far behind other presidents in using that presidential power but he used it actually just a just yesterday I think in the case of a woman who had served more than twenty years look at the details of that story in a moment a few interesting pardons done by Donald Trump and I want to read them and show you some videotape of them because it's the left hates it the left hates it the Donald Trump is pardoning people that the progressive left would claim to support but they never lifted a finger for so we'll talk about that I also want to show you Samantha bee the offensive comedian man I'm allowed to say she's offend so I don't want to censor her anything I think she's just and I think actually there can be some great comedy that's offensive I mean Eddie Murphy when he came on the scene was shockingly offensive I actually don't mind offensive comedy I think Howard Stern is pretty funny and I can't think of anyone more offensive the name the thing is what actually offends me about Samantha me she's not funny she's not funny all right and I want to start off though with a story that Canadians will find interesting and Justin Trudeau's fans and critics around the world will find interesting it's Justin Trudeau the self-described male feminist well wouldn't you know an old editorial has surfaced it was from the year 2000 so granted it was 18 years ago but Trudeau was in his mid-20s he was not a child he was a grown-up and this story written by a newspaper in Creston British Columbia accuses Justin Trudeau of groping a pretty young journalist who made the mistake of getting within hands reach of Trudeau keep that up on the screen I'm gonna read it it's an editorial called open eyes and they quote because it's this excuse that I think is even more dramatic I'm sorry if I had known you were reporting for a national paper I never would have been so forward those were the words that were spoken to it put that back up there I want to keep reading a little bit more from the story to explain it those were the words that were spoken to in advance the Creston Advanced reporter by Justin Trudeau son of former prime minister Pierre Trudeau on August 4 Trudeau who was in Creston to celebrate the kokanee summit festival put on by the Columbia brewery apologized a day late for inappropriately handling the reporter while she was on assignment not only for the advance but also for the National Post event Cooper son if I had known you were reporting for a national paper it's not a rare incident to have a young reporter especially a female who's working for a small community newspaper be considered an underling to their more predominant associates and blatantly disrespected because of it but shouldn't the son of a former prime minister be aware of the rights and wrongs that go along with public socializing and it goes on to describe Justin Trudeau groping someone I the fact that this story has remained unreported during Justin Trudeau's election in 2015 and during the whole me - movement and only has come to light now on the Internet shows you how calcified Canada's media party is I'm going to show you Breitbart calm which actually did a story on a Breitbart calm is based in the United States Justin Trudeau accused of groping reporter in 2000 look how they started in every cent really resurfaced editorial Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau appears to apologize for inappropriately handling female reporter and it goes on as of this moment I don't see any mainstream media in Canada or actually other than Breitbart in the state's covering this story if it was about Donald Trump groping someone in year 2000 of course we would hear about it we know that we did hear about it it was probably the biggest cannon blast at Donald Trump in the 2016 campaign not that he had groped someone but rather that he had talked about groping someone in a locker talking banter with a reporter from NBC and they recorded the audio why is a grope by Trudeau that he apologized for the day later saying I'm sorry wouldn't it be so forward had I known you were a reporter because then you would tell people about what I'm really like why is that only reported by the Foreign Press it reminds me of when Justin Trudeau got in trouble for that people kind common can we pull up the people kind video clip you know what I'm talking about or maybe some of you don't a few months back Justin Trudeau was doing a press call it certain not a press scrap was doing a town-hall meeting and he was asking severely normal Canadians the little people for their questions and one woman went on a little bit about women or the future of the world and we loved women let me know when we've got that clip guys and and she was saying that well we have to we have to the sake of mankind or something and he interrupted her he positively interrupt her and say no no we don't say mankind we say people kind no that's actually not a Fame the word people kind is not a real word here let me show you the video just to remind you what that looked like so we'd like you to look what we would like to say people kind not necessarily mankind is more inclusive so he interrupted her any man's plane to her but he made up a word there's no such things people kind some people say human kind so he's such a male feminist and everywhere he goes he talks about what a male feminist he is he's in high-level negotiations with Donald Trump of the United States right now about a NAFTA free-trade agreement he went to Davos Switzerland to speak to the World Economic Forum and he talked about bringing feminist policies into the boardroom he's never been in the boardroom of course he's never run anything other than his mouth he's brought in requirements for oil and gas industry in Canada to meet a gender analysis I don't really know how you do a gender analysis of oil and gas other than to say well in Canada we actually allow women to drive cars not so in Saudi Arabia maybe that's our gender analysis of so Trudeau was such a hot male feminist and it is my thesis but the noisier a man is about being a male feminist the more likely he is overcompensating and pre-empting and laying down you know but I'm but I'm a good guy message tracks for when his me to moment comes out if you look at every single me to predator from Harvey Weinstein at the top on down they're all male feminists in Canada the worst me to moment was a Women's Studies major who had a job at the CBC his name was Jan gamma she talked about what a feminist he was he spoke in that sexy voice all the time ladies I'm really on your side he was a male feminist he actually took women's studies and it turned out that he would physically smash women in the face on dates again and again and again and again the CBC heard of these accusations they actually set up a war room to discredit the accusers and he was finally revealed and fired my theory is the louder the male feminists the more likely is that covering up their own track record of misconduct and wouldn't you know it Justin Trudeau a born-again feminist it is credibly accused of groping by a reporter well why is that reporter being silent all these years who is that reporter we still don't know can you imagine that you are actually a reporter who was actually groped by Justin Trudeau according to its crest in advance and you won't even report it because maybe you're actually in love with Trudeau yourself I want to show you again how foreign press cover Canada's gropey Trudeau's more than the Canadian presses I just sent here's an old article if we could put that up on the screen for a second here this is from a US newspaper I just here it is Pierre gave her a black eye now what are we talking about here let me call up this original here is from the Milwaukee Sentinel can you keep this on the screen for a bit so this was a story from March 28th 1979 in the Milwaukee Sentinel so this isn't some obscure blog this isn't some Twitter this is in the age of bricks and mortar newspapers you well I what can I say we're having internet problems I don't think it's the deep state trying to shut us down I think it's just crappy internet and I apologize to you we sell 184 folks sticking around maybe they're sticking around for the chatter I don't know what you heard me say there before we were cut off but I was reading from the Milwaukee Sentinel which is a mainstream publication it's not just an obscure blog or Twitter feed we're talking about 1979 here where Pierre Trudeau beat Justin Trudeau's mum Margaret Trudeau let me read three key paragraphs in case that was cut off so I'm reading from the Milwaukee Sentinel March 28 1979 and again my point here is Trudeau men aren't exactly the nicest when it comes to women Justin Trudeau has a hell of a role model when it comes to women and as usual it falls to the Foreign Press to have a critical review of the Trudeau's more than the Canadian Press so let me read from this Milwaukee Sentinel article March 28 1979 Pierre slugged me she said the next morning he's given me a black eye but things are gonna be okay he doesn't mind my being a photographer actually I was quite pleased it was the first time in a very long time very long wild that I'd been able to get a response from Pierre he got all his hostility out and he hasn't shown me so much attention in years it showed he really loved me she said contentedly in a strange way it's made us closer I guess I felt this was his way of showing he cared Pierre must have felt closer to me because that night he was very macho all right I'll stop reading but it's a very lengthy article about how Justin Trudeau's dad Pierre Trudeau beat Margaret so badly he gave her a black eye um I'm not saying that Justin Trudeau beats women I don't think Justin Trudeau does but I'm saying that Justin Trudeau grew up in a home where beating his mum was normal it was a bizarre marriage to begin with Pierre Trudeau was decades older than Margaret Trudeau he married her she was what 21 or something I'd have to check and he was what almost triple her age it was doomed from the outset but I don't know it was just too glamorous for anyone to in any fancy people to object to and maybe that's the same of Justin Trudeau he's just too glamorous for people to object I think that we know only a fraction of Justin Trudeau's private life we know from his own confession that he loves doing illegal drugs even since he's become MP you think he'd sort of grow up and as MP even if he loved drugs that maybe he would at least follow the law as the top law maker and if he didn't believe in marijuana laws then he should revise them but to me what I what other things does he do we know he loves alcohol can we call up the clip of Justin Trudeau and meeting with David Axelrod in Chicago and again I don't think there's anything illegal about drinking to excess and getting so drunk you're wobbly but we've seen from the manifests and the access to information requests about Justin Trudeau's flights on Canada's version of Air Force One do they consume thousands of dollars worth of wine on these flights I mean I just maybe it's just a few extremely expensive bottles but I don't think so I think they're getting drunk on these planes and again I'm not against people drinking and I'm not saying that the Prime Minister can't drink I think it's a little bit dangerous to to be drunk as the Prime Minister because you never know when a shocking tragedy or incident might strike and you need your wits about you both George W Bush and Donald Trump are teetotalers Bush because he used to be an addict and went cold turkey Trump says he's never had alcohol ever since he was a young person he knew it would be wrong for him you don't want a drunk as your president or prime minister because what happens if god forbid you're drunk and a 9/11 happens at 1:00 a.m. when you're drunk how do you make decisions when you're drunk take a look at this video of Justin Trudeau meeting David Axelrod in Chicago I don't know why Trudeau was meeting Axelrod he's a former big shot in the Obama campaign Trudeau meets with Democrats instead of meeting with Trump's team we're trying to negotiate an after take a look at Trudeau so drunk he was literally wobbling one wobble two wobbles three wobbles take a look it's longer than that there's another version where he steps back and that's a good one you see the first wobble and you see the second wobble but that goes longer because when he sits down there's a third wobble if we can find that I'd like to show it I mean you get the feeling there he was sort of staggered a little bit but I think if you see when he sits down you get the full impact of it's not critical to show it but I guess when my larger point is we've never actually vetted Justin Trudeau just the same way Barack Obama was never actually vetted was that something that we only learned about Barack Obama hanging out with Lewis Farrakhan the racist Nation of Islam leader after 8 years of Barack Obama's president so you're saying that no reporter no investigative journalists no private I knew that Barack Obama was chummy with Louis Farrakhan until after Obama was president I'm sorry I don't believe that there's so many things about Barack Obama that we we never knew we never there's huge gaps in his history no one recalls him from his student days at Harvard he was the editor of the Harvard Law Review but he actually never published anything never wrote anything where was he who is he what was he doing 8 years as president we know so little about him not so with Donald Trump whose life has been inspected minutely Justin Trudeau we don't know his history we don't we know that he boasted once to an Iranian newspaper that he had been to 90 countries just sort of as a tourist can you even name 90 countries let alone visit them if you visited four countries a year and I mean we're I mean I'm not talking about just going to you could go to a bunch of little European countries I suppose in a week but nine you're travelling to all the continents you take in years so what was it doing what was he like besides marijuana what drugs was he into did he get into any criminal trouble what what do we know about him here we have a story from the crest in advance that he groped a reporter in 2000 and then said whoops I didn't know you were an important person I wouldn't groped you what else is the media covering up about Justin Trudeau because our Canadian media is very dot so I don't quite know all right I apologize again for the problems with the live stream there I promise we'll get it tidied up for tomorrow I thank you for sticking around looks like we have 500 people back I salute you I salute you for coming back I think we should proceed with the next item because it's already 1234 and we spent a little bit of time with our Internet Stan foods I want to show you something that I found heartening it Donald Trump has used the power that a president has to pardon it's that's an awesome power you could theoretically use that power to pardon a murderer or a terrorist if you want obviously it's something that you want to use rarely you don't want to just pardon on mass theoretically that could be done there's no limits to it theoretically the president the United States could have pardoned an entire prison now often presidents wait till the last day of their term to do the heavy lifting of the pardoning because they do pardons that they know the public will not like and so they don't want to do it when they're that can take any political flack Donald Trump doesn't care he's proud of his pardons I see a super Jack come in let me just quickly read it rare Groove says thank you for your support of Tommy that's all I want him to say well that's nice to you to say I support Tommy because I got to know him and become a friend I wouldn't say we're that close but we're more like that's me and that's him we're not like that's me and that's him now I'm joking right I've visited Tommy probably half a dozen times in the UK over the year he worked for us and I talked to him on the phone a fair bit he's quite a character the thing about Tommy he's the same in person as Ian and is on TV he's a little bit of a rascal a little bit of a troublemaker hey team while I'm just could you look up a video remember that where Tommy went to the home of a reporter at night which was a terrible idea and the cops come and and the cop says what's your name and Tommy gives them an answer that's a joke do you know that what I'm talking about I just want to show that clip Tommy is set to rascal it just made me think of he's so he's such a trickster I want to show you this and would you make a joke like this too Polly will call I'll show you the video when my team gets it i reaiiy see another super tweet from Cindy Moxxi any news on Tommy free time well unfortunately we have no news because no appeal has been filed and if there is no appeal to be filed we won't have news he will likely be released before the duration of his 13 months sentence in Canada that's called parole and you're not in the United Kingdom that's called tag that's just what they call it you're tagged they put a little tag on your ankle and anklets like a GPS that this sort of tracks you so Tommy might get out who knows in four months or so that's still an enormous amount of time to serve I want to get back to Donald Trump but I hear in my ear that my team has found the video of Tommy let me show you this video so let me just give me some bang I mean my point is what Tommy's really like he's a rascal and he's a handful and so this was some reporter who had called Tommy far right and Tommy hates that because he's not far right being for free speech and against the cyma fication is not far right and he hates that because they're just trying to say you're not saying he's does not say at all it's the opposite so he goes to this reporters house then he went after dark I don't think it's a good idea to go to someone's house after dark in an aggressive manner it's one of the many stresses of dealing with Tommy I mean doing in the daytime but after dark there's an element of Menace are you there to rob I mean obviously he wasn't but it's no surprise that the police come so there's Tommy and he's been in trouble with the law before okay and he's outside this reporters house and this reporters probably some sort of a big shot and the reporter called the cops and the cops are coming and they don't know are they going into a hot situation is it a robber or who is it so this is a stressful situation right and what would you or I do we'd say oh crap the police are here just go home let me show you a top but Tommy Robinson said when the police showed up at night when Tommy was doing a door knock on some guy's house roll the clip yeah so is Phil just Phil going mcgroin yeah ma Steven Leonard house film ago you did get it like fil morning fil mcgroin the cop was there writing him up eating a little bit of trouble okay and that cop seemed like a nice enough guy I mean if if I was a policeman and someone phoned and said it's night time and there's a guy outside my house knocking on my door he's not going away yeah I'd go check it out what's going on the cop comes he's riding up Tommy hey what's your name Phil okay Phil what's your name mimic groom I don't even know what Phil my groin means I mean I know what a groin is I know what Phil I don't know how you feel a groin I don't maybe it's a British ISM but but he get my the cop he's not arresting him but he's riding up a very official piece of paper and Tommy is not just cool as a cucumber he's he's making jokes he's making jokes to the cop and the cop says what's your name and you'll notice he gave him his legal name Stephen Lennon Tommy Robinson is a nickname his real name is Stephen Lennon so Tommy actually did give his real name to the cop there but not before going with a practical joke for a long time I mean it seemed long to me it's probably less than a minute but when a cop is filling out a form with your name what's your name Phil what's your last name mcgroin how do you spell that he spelt like like he kept that joke going as long as he could and he was giggling I'm giggling now too but I'm laughing because it's soap so he was giggling in the moment that's Tommy Robinson I see a new super chat it's supposed to feel my groin feel my groin kyle fairchild says okay now I get it it wasn't Phil it's feel my groin that's funny I I didn't understand Phil Phil my groin feeling okay thank you for explaining I'm a little bit slow on the uptake yeah thank you for explaining the job to me that's funny jelly a policeman oh my god Tommy would you agree with me my viewer friends that Tommy is a rascal would you agree with me that he's a handful let me tell you we've had a number of handfuls work for the rebel over the years some of the men for not to mention by name we've had a lot of characters passed through the rabble over the years but would you agree with me that Tommy probably has the biggest personality of all of them and sometimes he would stress me out you don't think I was just a tiny bit stressed out that he's engaging the cop in that manner there was the occasion he went to court in Canterbury and he didn't just stress me out he put us in a five-alarm situation where we got a legal dream team and got him out and he's a bit of a handful because Tommy Tommy's not built to have a boss of any sort even a boss who likes him obviously I like Tommy he's Tommy and I built for a boss Tommy drives you crazy Tommy is probably the most stubborn person I've ever met in my life that's not a cause to throw a guy in jail stubbornness that Tommy showed by going to that courthouse in Leeds despite being under suspended sentence from Canterbury is not a reason to imprison him simply being stubborn is not a crime and I put it to you what Tommy did outside Leeds did not break any law and was not a contempt of court he did not reveal any confidences from the trial inside he did not call the criminals criminals he called them accused or alleged criminals he only read a BBC publication with the names of the accused and if Tommy goes to prison for that how does the BBC itself not so I'm I'm laughing at Tommy the rascal I'm pulling my hair out at Tommy the rascal I'm telling you that he's as stubborn in real life as he looks on TV not everyone you know he's self-deprecating he stuff that I mean he's not the tallest guy and he makes fun of his lack of height all the luck he's self-deprecating he's funny even that feel mcgroin you gotta admit that's a little bit funny people who meet Tommy like him because he's hail-fellow-well-met and and even when we were dry when we would occasionally drive through the UK countryside going he always goes to the north of Britain and we would be at the gas station and he would go and we were all stretch our legs because these were long drives and people would come up and he would meet anyone including Muslims who really made a beeline towards Tommy Tommy would always start on the right foot we would always start friendly assume the best you know he was cautious you could see he was looking around and his cousin keV was there in case anything went sideways but Tommy always had a friendly approach he called everyone bruv or mate your friendly little British isms and I think his imprisonment is unjust and that's why we talk about him alright enough about Tony I just need I just wanted to show you that little joke from Tommy Robinson um let's let's talk about I told you about Justin Trudeau and how his dad his mom used to give her a black I told you how Justin Trudeau himself is now being outed as being a groper some years ago and the Canadian media has kept it a secret for eighteen years showed you that Tommy video that was not planned things team for funding a video in a hurry let me show you a clip of Alice Johnson a black woman who had a peripheral role in in a drug deal she was not a drug kingpin she landed life in prison without parole I mean you think Tommy Robinson stream in this harsh imagine being in prison for decades for making one dumb move for decades let me show you the sheer joy and hope you want to see the dictionary definition of joy and redemption and a second chance we'll watch this lady I'm free to start over I cannot this is the greatest day of my life I cannot my heart it's just bursting with gratitude for what has taken place what has happened to me today I had to report back to my unit team and when I got there my my case manager mr. hollar he Dow he was calling I do I had an attorney call but I still didn't know what it was and when they all came on then I heard Kim Kardashian some voice and she was the one who told me that I was that it had happened that I was free that I was I was going to reach her like family Kim told me when she left that White House meeting that no matter how this turns out that she will never stop fighting for me until I come home so it this she's an incredible woman an amazing woman god bless all of y'all - even covering this I have to say this god Bless America - I want to say just President Trump I am going to make one ground that you gave me the second chance in life I will not disappoint the American sobbing oh hi there was another part of the clip and maybe we'll even find it is she she says I praise Jesus in fact if we can find them do we have that one the praise Jesus one there's a great clip of Alice Johnson saying my praise Jesus this couldn't be done without ID I Love You Jesus he praises she she praises Kim Kardashian and then she praises Donald John Trump uses all three of his names and she goes on for quite a bit it doesn't surprise me that that clip we showed there which was taken from CNN excised her very specific reference to Donald Trump if we can find that one I'd like to play this not critically important but I but the very fact that that CNN clip cut out her extended praise Trump it's not a surprise to me because it's such a beautiful story and if we can find that other clip where she she names the big three Jesus first got to give Him praise Kim Kardashian the Queen and then Donald J Trump president the United States why didn't Barack Obama pardon this woman she's a black woman I mean did 95 percent of black women vote for Obama 99 percent that's the demographic group that votes more in line as an ethnic group that any others did use vote Democrats 60 70 % Hispanics about the same but black women it's very overwhelmingly Obama support why didn't why didn't Barack Obama pardon her I don't know why um I have a list in front of me of a short list of people that Barack Obama has so excuse me that Donald Trump is pardoned and includes Jack Johnson now he's dead now he's deceased but he was the first black heavyweight boxing champion and he was convicted 105 years ago like in 1913 of transporting a white woman across Dateline's which was against the law Jim Crow laws back then like it was a racist law and and over the course of his life he spent ten months in prison he and he was a great fighter he's a great boxer and Sylvester Stallone brought that case to the attention of Trump and for years people have been trying to exonerate and pardoned Jack Johnson no relation to Alice Johnson I'm sure so again you've got a black sports hero a groundbreaking man in the african-american community sports I mean remember sports weren't always integrated right so here you have a black heavyweight boxing champion who was probably convicted properly but under an odious law do you know what I mean I'm not saying that the trial was unfair in its procedure but the substance of it you know it was a racist law that was on the books in 1913 so for a man to serve time in jail for racist law that strikes me as something that ought to be pardoned why didn't Barack Obama do that he was busy pardoning all sorts of weird I mean and the Democrats are the worst of this they pardoned their big donors mark Rich's a name that comes to mind huge donors dinesh d'souza was someone that donald trump pardoned very recently he is Indian Canadian I'm not sure what his religion is but he's from India originally I think he's going or something and he was arrested and imprisoned on trumped-up charges he donated I think ten thousand dollars and didn't comply with a election financing laws in the state so he's sent to prison Rosie O'Donnell just for comparison just a few weeks ago was revealed she did exactly the same thing as Dinesh D'Souza five times making donations in different names from different average addresses which suggests a guilty mind no charges let alone imprisonment so Trump pardoned D'Souza I think it's a symbol that he was going to undo the political convictions and prosecutions of the Obama era there was one more example I mentioned it was a Orthodox Jew who was the executive of a kosher meatpacking company's name is Sholem Reuben and nine years ago he was convicted of money laundering which involved him sending banks fake statements to make his company look richer than it was to borrow more money so it was a little bit of fraud he was sentenced to 27 years in prison which seemed quite harsh and and Democrats and Republicans alike called for his pardoning four years and Trump did it so he so these aren't I mean Dinesh D'Souza is a right winger it's true but his case was so out of line with sentencing norms and prosecution norms so I would put to you the case of this Jewish butcher 27 year prison sentence Alice Johnson 21 years for a tiny rule and I'm not condoning drug dealing I'm just saying really 21 years and the old case of the black heavyweight boxer who should never be in charged was charged under a bizarre racial law that's how Trump is using the power of the pardon I think it's wonderful and the fact that Kim Kardashian and Sylvester Stallone were involved to bring these cases to Trump's attention yeah it looks a little goofy but if they're using their celebrity for good and I think it is good in these cases what's wrong with that we hear celebrities opining on the stupidest things all the time I think Sloan Wester Stallone and Kim Kardashian can put a little check mark in the good things they've done in their life to help get people I'm in the case of Jack Johnson I mean obviously he's dead it will not give him any relief but it sets the historical record straight and I think Sylvester Stallone I think he did a good thing and Kim Kardashian does a lot of silly things a lot of gossipy celebrity things that have little matter and substance but I put it to you that what Kim Kardashian did using her celebrity to get access to the President to get a genuine good thing done do we have that that other tape from now we don't hey I've saw it on Twitter it was just really nice her sheer joy and talking about how she was born again really it's really nice my point is that this is so unusual that celebrities actually do something normally they just virtue signal you know there was a there was a movie I think forgetting Sarah Silverman was what it was called and Russell Brand was an actor and then he is singer Justin could you look up that video called we want to do something by infants or Oh Russell Brand played a character in this movie saving Silverman a rock star who was extremely loose and and he in the movie he was the leader of a band called infant sorrow isn't that it's silly right there and he was such an outrageous it's actually a pretty funny movie it was the first thing I'd really seen Russell Brand in and he made this real music video as this fake band infant sorrow and the video is we got to do something and I just want to show you and it was mocking celebrities who said we just kind of do something man just got to do something do we have that video handy let me just play for you 60 seconds Russell Brand pretending to be infants or Oh doing a song that is just nails 99% of Hollywood but in this case it doesn't nail Sly Stallone or Kim Kardashian who are real watch this Russell Brand video bleh bleh mother earth has been feeling unsatisfied I'd say it's plane from Lauren the sweet ladies started to cry fires crackle and blaze and the raise of a burning Harden I don't forget smart tune playing went for the day that she dies now we gotta do something before Mother Earth do something my breath is bad stuff in the world so mr. president all right we don't have to watch more it's just we got to do something man maybe I'll just make your video say we got to do something man I was looking at the comments as we were playing that and someone corrects me and says that Alice Johnson was had her sentence commuted not pardoned I appreciate the clarification and I also realized that I said the movie was called forgetting Sarah Silverman instead of forgetting sarah marshall but you get my point I hope you do that most of the time Hollywood praises itself for virtue signaling like at the Oscars denouncing global warming or something but actually to use your personal capital with the president to ask for a favor for someone you've never met I think that actually is a my esteem for Kim Kardashian which was extremely low is now less low okay it's 1257 oh my god we're almost out of time and I was going to show you Samantha bee and her fake apology non-apology you know what let me save that for tomorrow unless shorts the clip how long is the clip you know what we don't even have time to play the whole clip I'm gonna do that tomorrow okay I apologize we lost or you won we run five minutes late today let's run five minutes late because we had at least five minutes with the internet shenanigans okay just to recap mm-hmm Samantha be an unfunny Canadian there are funny Canadians Samantha B ain't one of them she's one of those comedians who think that in the era of Donald Trump just saying Democrat talking points with a laugh track underneath them is comedy I don't think that's true so the other day she called Ivanka Trump a feckless Cu NT but she said the word obviously was bleep before when - TV no I know enough about the world of TV having had a show on the National Sun News Network and doing my shows here at our more low lower scale Internet productions that you write a script and it is reviewed by producers and in the case of Samantha B it would probably be reviewed by lawyers and here at our little rebel news network at least five people or six people see my comments before I do my 8 p.m. show not this I'm doing I'm going live right here with you right now and I'm just unscripted but Samantha bees show is scripted it's written it's fed into a teleprompter she reads it people who touch that include her shows various producers the person who rules the teleprompter for her like they would not surprise me if if five people here five or six people here see my 8:00 p.m. show before it goes at least the text of it I can't imagine that fewer than 10 people reviewed and approved Samantha bees script it wasn't an off-the-cuff remark this was around the same time Roseanne Barr was fired from ABC for her top-rated sitcom because she made ad a joke that she regretted immediately apologized for it sincerely immediately off-the-cuff on Twitter Twitter's instant Samantha bee was scripted there was no accident to call Ivanka Trump that name and it was not an independent act of her accident or a gaffe take a look at her so-called apology take a look hi I'm Samantha beam you know a lot of people were offended and angry that I used an epithet to describe the president's daughter and advisor last week it is a word I have used on the show many times hoping to reclaim it this time I used it as an insult across the line I regret it and I do apologize for that the problem is that many women have heard that word at the worst moments of their lives a lot of them don't want that word reclaimed they want it gone and I don't blame them I don't want to inflict more pain on them I want this show to be challenging and I want it to be honest but I never intended it to hurt anyone except Ted Cruz many men were also offended by my use of the word I do not care about that I hate that this distracted from more important issues I hate that I did something to contribute to the nightmare of 24-hour news cycles that were all white knuckling through I should have known that a potty mouth insult would be inherently more interesting to them than juvenile immigration policy I would do anything to help those kids I hate that this distracted from them so to them I am also sorry and look if you are worried about the death of civility don't sweat it I'm a comedian people who hone their voices in basement bars while yelling back at drunk hecklers are definitely not Paragons of civility I am I'm really sorry that I said that word but you know what civility is just nice words maybe we should all worry a little bit more about the niceness of our actions okay thanks for listening by the way can you google that I tweeted it the other day it's a Daily wire story about Samantha B's husband's working to keep poor black kids out of their school today Lee Weyer stir just Samantha be husband like school I want to show that in a second I'm just talking to our producers here let me let me go through that apology there did she say sorry to Ivanka Trump no actually she didn't did she she didn't go watch it again she did not apologize to the person she she called that name to step1 step2 an apology isn't I'm sorry but it's I'm sorry we got and I'm sorry but and then a minute of forty-five of but didn't we mmm she says her offense was if you listen to her her meaning is I'm sorry because I distracted from the real offense that the Trump administration is doing so it's I'm sorry you were offended I'm sorry you reacted the way you did I'm sorry I gave my enemies ammo not I'm sorry for what I did and what's with the I'm sorry what about the word sorry and but I think one of the grossest parts was oh I we have to do something we have to do so what have you done Samantha be like what have you done I know what Kim Kardashian in Sly Stallone just did they did something can we put up that daily wire I just do here we go Samantha B's husband fights to keep poor black kids out of his children's school this was from last year in the Daily wire Jason Jones is not only a former correspondent for the left-wing Daily Show he is also husband to Samantha bee one of the leftist leaders of the so-called resistance movement against President Trump oh and Jones doesn't want the city of New York to move his children's school to a location that would make it more accessible to poor black kids ski scroll down a little bit both Samantha B and Jason Jones are wealthy and very white according to the Civil Rights Project New York is not the liberal utopia it is advertised to be at least if you're not white and wealthy just like when Democrats around the South Democrat around New York has managed to create the most racially segregated schools in the country let me read this in one paragraph and then I'll come back New York is the most segregated schools in the country in 2009 black and Latino students in the state had the highest concentration in intensely segregated public schools less than 10 percent white enrollment the lowest exposure to white students and the most uneven distribution with white students across schools heavily impacting these state rankings is New York City of the largest one most segregated public school systems in the nation just a little bit more I'll read a little more Slate reports that one of the reasons for this is that in the Upper West Side of Manhattan the most left-wing part of this left-wing state there's never-ending resistance you'll pardon the use of that word - opening up predominantly white schools to underprivileged minority students in other words these rich white left-wingers want their schools to remain rich and white the current Upper West Side focuses on public school 452 which according to slate has a NE I won't go on but it's Samantha B who is working hard or at least her husband is to keep poor black kids out of school cuz you know they're not our kind dear and so what have you done Samantha be in your life I don't mean ranting and swearing at women and debasing them what are you actually done besides keep black kids out of your school cuz you know they're not our kind they're not like us you know I said before about comedians being unfunny it's not funny just to read a Democrat talking point with the laugh track that was not funny there yeah so I don't think it's not for me to accept an apology on behalf of Ivanka Trump but there was no apology offered to Ivanka Trump and by the way um I don't think Ivanka Trump would want an apology I don't think she would value an apology from Samantha B and I don't think one was offered in any genuine way I think it's something I mean I have a rule apologize once a year whether i need to or not that's sort of a joke obviously we all need to apologize for something more than once a year when you actually do make a genuine apology for something that you are genuinely contrite about it is an enormous ly liberating feeling Samantha B in that one minute 45 second ironic apology I'm sorry you were offended I'm sorry Republicans reacted this way I'm not sorry for what I acted there was no genuine contrition there so what we did not see was an apology what we saw was oh shoot I should have been smarter because this blew up in my face an apology is actually done often in in private not as a showboat attempt that was PR damage control that's a Kathy Griffin type apology Democrats aren't very good for apologizing for things because they generally don't admit they're wrong you saw the other day I showed you a clip of Bill Clinton saying no I haven't apologized to to Monica Lewinsky other than him publicly he melted down when in a shock move a reporter said well you've never called her privately no no no no no no it's been 20 years in the oven you haven't even lifted up the phone no no no no no that's Democrats for you there's a lesson there I think I think if conservatives genuinely would feel like their spiritual and mental health would improve by making a genuine apology go ahead and make a genuine apology for your own sake but don't make an apology to appease your enemies Roseanne apologized for her tweet and was sacked within minutes Samantha be doubled down in Kahoot with her team that was a retrenchment in the Anna counter-attack that was not an apology there's a saying don't apologize don't explain and the left has a down pat I think maybe sometimes we on the right need to do it a bit too although I don't want to ever be as gross as them alright folks is 107 one went seven minutes longer today because we had about seven minutes worth of Internet problems I appreciate the 700 of you for sticking around through those problems I apologize we'll take a look at what happens when we're offline and try and make it a little bit better for tomorrow but thanks to our team for working very speedily to get it working again I look forward to seeing you tomorrow if we have Tomi news we'll share it my problem is I don't think we have Tommy News because until there's an appeal filed the news is another day in prison for Tommy which i think is a grave injustice until tonight if you watch my 8:00 p.m. show or tomorrow at noon if you watch this which you do on behalf of all of us here at rebel world headquarters goodbye and keep fighting for freedom you
