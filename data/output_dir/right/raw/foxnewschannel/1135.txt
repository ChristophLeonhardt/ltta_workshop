PRIMARY COVERAGE TONIGHT.

4
00:00:12,785 --> 00:00:14,053
WE HEARD A SHORT TIME AGO FROM

5
00:00:14,053 --> 00:00:16,489
THE REPUBLICANS, TALKING ABOUT

6
00:00:16,489 --> 00:00:17,357
GAS TAXES IN CALIFORNIA AND I

7
00:00:17,357 --> 00:00:19,392
THINK YOU'RE A CITY REVOLT.

8
00:00:19,392 --> 00:00:20,193
WONDERING WHETHER DEMOCRATIC

9
00:00:20,193 --> 00:00:22,095
ENTHUSIASM IS THERE TONIGHT.

10
00:00:22,095 --> 00:00:24,430
LET'S ASK A MAN WHO SHOULD KNOW.

11
00:00:24,430 --> 00:00:25,365
COMMUNICATIONS DIRECTOR FOR THE

12
00:00:25,365 --> 00:00:26,232
DEMOCRATIC CONGRESSIONAL

13
00:00:26,232 --> 00:00:27,767
CAMPAIGN COMMITTEE, JOINING US

00:00:27,767 --> 00:00:29,669
NOW ON THE PHONE.

15
00:00:29,802 --> 00:00:31,004
THANK YOU FOR BEING WITH US.

16
00:00:31,004 --> 00:00:32,405
WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF WHAT WE HAVE

17
00:00:32,405 --> 00:00:33,539
SEEN ACROSS THE COUNTRY?

18
00:00:33,539 --> 00:00:35,375
>> YES, THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME

19
00:00:35,375 --> 00:00:35,808
COME SHANNON.

20
00:00:35,808 --> 00:00:38,211
I THINK WE ARE SEEING THAT

21
00:00:38,211 --> 00:00:40,480
DEMOCRATIC ENTHUSIASM IS ONCE

22
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:44,751
AGAIN, DON NOT IN THESE PRIMARY

23
00:00:44,751 --> 00:00:45,952
RACES.

24
00:00:45,952 --> 00:00:48,554
IN NEW JERSEY, IOWA, AND IN

25
00:00:48,554 --> 00:00:48,988
CALIFORNIA.

26
00:00:48,988 --> 00:00:50,957
WE ARE REALLY EXCITED ABOUT THE

27
00:00:50,957 --> 00:00:52,392
CANDIDATES WHO ARE WINNING THESE

28
00:00:52,392 --> 00:00:53,793
PRIMARIES AND EMERGING FROM

29
00:00:53,793 --> 00:00:55,161
THESE RACES, CANDIDATES WITH

30
00:00:55,161 --> 00:00:56,896
DEEP TIES TO THESE DISTRICTS AND

31
00:00:56,896 --> 00:00:58,698
WE THINK THEY'LL GO ONTO A LOT

32
00:00:58,698 --> 00:00:59,299
OF SUCCESS IN NOVEMBER.

33
00:00:59,299 --> 00:01:01,401
>> Shannon: I WANT TO REDO

34
00:01:01,401 --> 00:01:02,802
SOMETHING WE HAVE EARLIER FROM

35
00:01:02,802 --> 00:01:05,171
THE "WASHINGTON EXAMINER."

36
00:01:05,171 --> 00:01:07,140
"THE DEMOCRATS BIGGEST CHALLENGE

37
00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:07,540
IS INTERNAL.

38
00:01:07,540 --> 00:01:09,409
THEIR ENTHUSIASM IS LEFT OF

39
00:01:09,409 --> 00:01:10,877
CENTER BUT THEIR PATH TO THE

40
00:01:10,877 --> 00:01:12,879
MAJORITY IS SMACK DAB IN THE

41
00:01:12,879 --> 00:01:13,212
CENTER."

42
00:01:13,212 --> 00:01:14,981
TO GAIN BACK THE SEATS THEY LOST

43
00:01:14,981 --> 00:01:17,583
IN THEIR PITCH LEFT BETWEEN

44
00:01:17,583 --> 00:01:18,952
292,016, THEY NEED TO CENTER

45
00:01:18,952 --> 00:01:19,419
THEMSELVES.

46
00:01:19,419 --> 00:01:22,588
WHAT IS THE FOCUS OF THE PARTY?

47
00:01:22,588 --> 00:01:24,057
THERE NEEDS TO BE ENERGY AND THE

48
00:01:24,057 --> 00:01:26,392
FURTHER LEFT, BUT ARE YOU

49
00:01:26,392 --> 00:01:27,860
SEEING, THINKING ABOUT THAT AND

50
00:01:27,860 --> 00:01:28,528
WEIGHING IT AS YOU LOOK AT

51
00:01:28,528 --> 00:01:33,166
CANDIDATES TO BACK IN THE

52
00:01:33,166 --> 00:01:34,100
PRIMARY END OF THE GENERAL?

53
00:01:34,100 --> 00:01:37,637
>> THE FOCUS OF THE PRIMARY

54
00:01:37,770 --> 00:01:39,973
HAS BEEN TWO ISSUES,

55
00:01:39,973 --> 00:01:41,407
HEALTH CARE, AND THE TAX BILL

56
00:01:41,407 --> 00:01:42,909
THAT THE REPUBLICAN CONGRESS

57
00:01:42,909 --> 00:01:44,010
PASSED AND PRESIDENT TRUMP

58
00:01:44,010 --> 00:01:45,611
SIGNED INTO LAW.

59
00:01:45,611 --> 00:01:47,613
ON HEALTH CARE, WE SAW A REVOLT

60
00:01:47,613 --> 00:01:49,349
ACROSS THE COUNTRY AGAINST

61
00:01:49,349 --> 00:01:50,750
REPUBLICAN ATTEMPTS REP

62
00:01:50,750 --> 00:01:52,085
HEALTH CARE AWAY FROM WORKING

63
00:01:52,085 --> 00:01:52,418
PEOPLE.

64
00:01:52,418 --> 00:01:57,724
EVEN IN THE TAX BILL, BECAUSE OF

65
00:01:57,724 --> 00:01:59,859
THE PROVISIONS IN IT,

66
00:01:59,859 --> 00:02:01,694
HEALTH CARE PREMIUMS WILL SPIKE

67
00:02:01,694 --> 00:02:02,929
ACROSS THE COUNTRY DUE TO THE

68
00:02:02,929 --> 00:02:05,198
IRRESPONSIBLE REPUBLICAN TAX

69
00:02:05,198 --> 00:02:05,498
PLAN.

70
00:02:05,498 --> 00:02:06,833
OUR CANDIDATES ARE IN THE

71
00:02:06,833 --> 00:02:08,067
DISTRICT TALKING ABOUT

72
00:02:08,067 --> 00:02:08,868
HEALTH CARE, TALKING ABOUT THE

73
00:02:08,868 --> 00:02:11,404
TAX BILL, AND WHAT IT MEANS FOR

74
00:02:11,404 --> 00:02:11,904
THESE DISTRICTS.

75
00:02:11,904 --> 00:02:13,072
THESE CANDIDATES UNDERSTAND THE

76
00:02:13,072 --> 00:02:13,973
DISTRICTS THEY ARE RUNNING IN,

77
00:02:13,973 --> 00:02:15,074
THEY ARE OUT THERE EVERY DAY

78
00:02:15,074 --> 00:02:16,042
TALKING TO VOTERS.

79
00:02:16,042 --> 00:02:17,510
WE FEEL REALLY GOOD ABOUT THE

80
00:02:17,510 --> 00:02:18,411
MESSAGE THEY ARE DELIVERING

81
00:02:18,411 --> 00:02:18,945
ACROSS THE COUNTRY.

82
00:02:18,945 --> 00:02:20,646
>> Shannon: AS YOU KNOW, THE

83
00:02:20,646 --> 00:02:22,515
NONPARTISAN TAX POLICY CENTER, A

84
00:02:22,515 --> 00:02:23,950
LOT OF PEOPLE THINK LEADS TO THE

85
00:02:23,950 --> 00:02:25,518
LEFT, THAT 85% OF AMERICANS WERE

86
00:02:25,518 --> 00:02:26,919
GETTING CAUGHT UNDER THE TAX

87
00:02:26,919 --> 00:02:29,188
BILL, 10% WOULD REMAIN THE SAME,

88
00:02:29,188 --> 00:02:30,490
5% MAY HAVE A HIKE.

89
00:02:30,490 --> 00:02:31,491
POLLING SHOWS THAT MORE THE

90
00:02:31,491 --> 00:02:32,658
PEOPLE LEARNED ABOUT IT, THE

91
00:02:32,658 --> 00:02:33,593
MORE THEY SEE THEIR PAYCHECKS,

92
00:02:33,593 --> 00:02:35,528
THEY THINK IT IS NOT SUCH A BAD

93
00:02:35,528 --> 00:02:36,329
THING, GROWING IN POPULARITY.

94
00:02:36,329 --> 00:02:38,598
HOW DO YOU RUN AGAINST THAT?

95
00:02:38,598 --> 00:02:41,901
>> WE HAVEN'T SEEN HUNDRED IS

96
00:02:41,901 --> 00:02:44,570
GROWING IN POPULARITY.

97
00:02:44,570 --> 00:02:45,304
ULTIMATELY, A BIG PROBLEM WITH

98
00:02:45,304 --> 00:02:46,973
THE TAX BILL, IN ADDITION TO THE

99
00:02:46,973 --> 00:02:47,673
HEALTH CARE PREMIUM INCREASES

100
00:02:47,673 --> 00:02:49,776
THAT IT WILL LEAD TO, IS THAT IT

101
00:02:49,776 --> 00:02:51,377
WAS USUALLY WEIGHTED TOWARD

102
00:02:51,377 --> 00:02:53,746
LARGER CORPORATION, CORPORATIONS

103
00:02:53,746 --> 00:02:54,380
ON THE WEALTHY.

104
00:02:54,380 --> 00:02:55,248
AMERICANS UNDERSTAND THAT

105
00:02:55,248 --> 00:02:57,183
IMBALANCE IN THE BILL, AND I

106
00:02:57,183 --> 00:02:57,984
THINK THAT MANY AMERICANS WILL

107
00:02:57,984 --> 00:02:59,185
AGREE THAT THERE ARE BETTER

108
00:02:59,185 --> 00:03:01,754
THINGS TO SPEND $1.5 TRILLION ON

109
00:03:01,754 --> 00:03:04,357
THAT MASSIVE TAX CUTS FOR LARGE

110
00:03:04,357 --> 00:03:05,124
CORPORATIONS, AND THE WEALTHIEST

111
00:03:05,124 --> 00:03:08,194
AMERICANS YOU DON'T NEED IT.

112
00:03:08,194 --> 00:03:10,029
>> Shannon: ALSO INCLUDING 85%

113
00:03:10,029 --> 00:03:12,165
OF AMERICANS.

114
00:03:12,165 --> 00:03:13,266
85%.

115
00:03:13,266 --> 00:03:14,300
THOSE AREN'T MY NUMBERS.

116
00:03:14,300 --> 00:03:16,202
>> WE ARE NOT DISPUTING THAT

117
00:03:16,202 --> 00:03:19,439
SOME AMERICANS WILL GET SOME TAX

118
00:03:19,439 --> 00:03:20,840
CUTS IN THIS BILL.

119
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:27,113
BUT THEY UNDERSTAND THAT THE

120
00:03:27,113 --> 00:03:27,780
LION'S SHARE OF THE TAX CUTS

121
00:03:27,780 --> 00:03:28,481
WENT TO THESE CORPORATIONS AND

122
00:03:28,481 --> 00:03:29,048
WENT TO THE WEALTHIEST

123
00:03:29,048 --> 00:03:29,415
AMERICANS.

124
00:03:29,415 --> 00:03:30,316
AND MANY AMERICANS HAVE SAID,

125
00:03:30,316 --> 00:03:31,551
MAYBE THEY GET A LITTLE BIT THAT

126
00:03:31,551 --> 00:03:33,219
HELPS AND THAT'S GREAT BUT THEY

127
00:03:33,219 --> 00:03:34,954
SEE THAT IT'S A VERY UNBALANCED

128
00:03:34,954 --> 00:03:35,388
BILL.

129
00:03:35,388 --> 00:03:36,789
I THINK THERE'S A LOT OF

130
00:03:36,789 --> 00:03:37,557
QUESTIONS AS TO WHY REPUBLICAN

131
00:03:37,557 --> 00:03:38,691
MEMBERS THOUGHT IT WAS MORE

132
00:03:38,691 --> 00:03:40,626
IMPORTANT TO GIVE THESE KINDS OF

133
00:03:40,626 --> 00:03:41,594
TAX CUTS TO CORPORATIONS AND TO

134
00:03:41,594 --> 00:03:42,495
THE WEALTHY WHEN THERE ARE A LOT

135
00:03:42,495 --> 00:03:44,297
OF OTHER THINGS WE COULD SPEND

136
00:03:44,297 --> 00:03:44,730
THAT MONEY ON.

137
00:03:44,730 --> 00:03:45,832
>> Shannon: WE KNOW THOSE ARE

138
00:03:45,832 --> 00:03:47,033
THE SECTORS OF SOCIETY THAT ALSO

139
00:03:47,033 --> 00:03:49,836
PAY BY FAR THE LARGEST MARGIN OF

140
00:03:49,836 --> 00:03:50,603
THE TAXES.

141
00:03:50,603 --> 00:03:51,871
PATRICK, I HEAR YOU.

142
00:03:51,871 --> 00:00:00,000
WE THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR
