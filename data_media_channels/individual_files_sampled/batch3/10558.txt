bamboozled the entire world and I'm very glad that President Trump has said well you know enough of that we're not going to be hoodwinked we're not going to be taken for a ride we're gonna have to do a serious serious change here to make sure that Iran does not have nuclear weapons that means that this deal was a terrible deal why give this speech in English and do it in such a big way well because I wanted the world to hear it all of it while Bibi may claim he's trying to convince the world that really isn't true the only person he needs to convince is Trump and given Trump's past rhetoric that may not be so difficult to do Donald Trump made it clear he didn't like the deal back in the days of his campaign and Netanyahu's presentation more showmanship than facts seemed to really mesh with Trump tonight I'm here to tell you one thing Iran lied I think of anything what's happening today and what's happened over the last little while and what we've learned has really shown that I've been 100 percent right his presentation was largely in English and he went all out to prove that Iran is developing nuclear weapons he presented thousands of documents CDs as part of his PowerPoint presentation except almost all of it was old some of the stuff be be presented as undisputable evidence dated to 1993 almost nothing beyond 2003 experts said John Brennan former CIA director said Netanyahu showed nothing that indicated that Iran had violated the nuclear deal and the international atomic agency agrees the agency had no credible indications of activities in Iran relevant to the development of a nuclear explosive device after 2009 the US after Bibi stunt said that this proves that Iran quote has a robust clandestine nuclear weapons program a few hours later they changed it quietly to Iran quote had a robust clandestine nuclear weapons program they blamed clerical error for that one nonetheless they say Iran is still dishonest Iran lied on the front end they were dishonest actors so far it's been entirely unconvincing experts aren't buying it US officials skeptical pundits unconvinced European allies urging Trump to come to his senses and reconsider almost everyone else is too but Benjamin Netanyahu has his charms he's done it before there is no question whatsoever that Saddam is seeking and is working and is advancing towards the development of nuclear weapons no question whatsoever see how confident he was only an invasion and thousands of deaths later did we find out that Bibi had lied his charms never worked with Obama they didn't get along all that well but they got along great with Bush and it looks like it's working with Trump great friends those two they've both claimed well just some background hailed as a huge diplomatic success the Iran nuclear deal was hammered out back in 2015 that was between the US China Britain Russia France and Germany negotiations took nine years ending a sustained period of stalemate over a rounds nuclear activities Tehran agreed to strict limits on its nuclear program and also to open up its facilities to international experts in return some sanctions against the country were lifted well Daniel McAdams executive director at the Ron Paul Institute for peace on prosperity says the Israeli leader wants to maneuver the u.s. into a confrontation with Iran Netanyahu knows very well that he cannot take on Iran on his own Bibi is playing trump like a fiddle but look around Trump he's got all the same losers that were in power in 2002 who lied us into going into Iraq well we're supposed to believe that somehow just a week or so before Trump has to make his decision on Iran that all of a sudden they've come into this amazing information here let us rush to share with you this information telling you how evil they are it's all pure theatrics just like it's ridiculous bomb thing at the UN it's just a desperate ploy to lie us into another war
