after weeks of working with sources in
San Juan we met with the leadership of
one of Puerto Rico street gangs these
guys run the show in the projects and
control the illicit trade of drugs and
guns on the ice we told them we wanted
to see some firepower so they hooked us
up with what they said was their best
psychotic an assassin who we followed
into the jungle outside of Gondor
one of the worst slums on the island to
show us the tools of his trade our guys
not willing to talk on camera but he's
going to show us the guns and what he's
got let me go so alright what he's
showing me is that they built a chip
into the back right here and this turns
this handgun which you can buy almost
anywhere into a fully automatic weapon
and you have a high-capacity magazine -
well he's going to demo for us right now
watch this
one of things I learned on this trip is
that it's super hard to actually shoot
guns legally here so in order to to test
their illegal they gotta come out
here and practice it looks like we have
some high caliber rifles this is that
they brought out for us this right here
is an ar-15 this right here is make a
table viously is like one of the most
famous weapons in the world the
coalition of COFF favorite of insurgents
and african dictatorships and one of the
things that he told me is that they
actually need these weapons to defend
themselves against the police said the
police here are super corrupt and and so
that's why they have these high-powered
weapons and then finally this is a ak-47
frame this uses this 30 round magazine
to fire shotgun shells basically just
locked and loaded in rack dak
so just blast off the just dumped a
bunch of rounds from the a K into the
clearing barrel you can actually feel it
smoking from the heat from the rounds
you can smell it and no like now we
got to get out of here
we're out
