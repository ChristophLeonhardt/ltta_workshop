I was an instructor I'd come back from two combat deployments to Iraq Joc when I'd work together in battle Ramadi and I was training leaders and teaching the next generation of sea leaders all the students are broken into teams and so there's there's seven guys assigned to a boat and they're carrying these big 200-pound rubber boats that's that's their team and each one of those boats has a leader the senior guy that is the boat crew leader one boat crew is winning every race and they get rewarded by sitting out the next race and another boat crew is losing every race and they were miserably fallen behind the rest of the pack coming in 50 yards behind everybody else and you could hear him yelling and screaming and blaming things on each other we decided to perform a little leadership experiment we pulled the two leaders out and we swapped them out we put the leader of the bad boat crew boat crew six and mokra to put the leader of the good book of bokor two in bokor six and then we set them back out there lo and behold the boat crew that was failing the worst poker in the class book were six now when's the next race I didn't even know how that was going to go as we watched it but it's just a glaring example to me of that this this principle is actually true there are no bad teams only bad leaders and so it's up to the leader to believe that it's possible for the team to do better believe it's possible to win get the entire team to believe it's possible to win and get them all focused on the mission working together in order to accomplish that mission and that's just how critical it isn't jock and I work together in a number of different areas where we saw that happen where a platoon struggle a tasket struggled and you replace that that that leader a new leader comes in and turns bad performance into good
