all right joining us from Washington with look at Axios am political reporter for Axios Alexei McCammon Alexei good morning to you talk to you about your one big thing this morning sure so today's one big thing is a look inside president Trump's 2023 election campaign staffers close to him have told us that they have about fewer than 10 staff members working on this quiet re-election campaign for 2020 in the basement of the Republican National Committee here in Washington DC and the message they're going to push in 2020 during the election is one of the economy and security and change ha interesting change from an incumbent incumbent to say the least talking about the state so they're focusing on and how they plan to focus on those states which they think are most vulnerable income 2020 there are two states that president Trump's re-election campaign is really focusing on in hopes of picking up and that's Minnesota and Colorado and you'll remember in 2016 president Trump barely lost Minnesota without even really trying or sort of catering his campaign message to Minnesota and his strategy for Colorado is to sort of emphasize this message that he has been sort of hands-off on marijuana laws in various states and try to use that as a selling point to pick up two states that he lost in 2016 I know that Axios is also looking at the role of Brad parts Cal who is Trump's digital media director back in 2016 now serving as the manager of the 20/20 campaign quite a jump for him what are you learning about his strategy going forward looking ahead to 2020 you know that's the really interesting thing about Brad Parks Cal as you just mentioned he was the digital director in 2016 now he's the campaign manager for 2020 which is a big jump and it shows just what the Trump campaign team thinks is successful for him which is focusing on this sort of digital first strategy and that's what we can expect from Brad parse Cal another thing that really helped Trump in 2016 was sort of the element of surprise he came into this election in 2016 and ambushed the other candidates and you know the media and voters with how successful he could ultimately be they will not have that advantage now so Brad Parks Cal we can expect him to work on a longer range strategy that is more systematic and one that is digital first that also incorporates this sort of technological innovation and corporate efficiency so so so just how it evolved is the president going to be working with par scale going forward we're told that Brad parse Cal and the president are talking pretty frequently almost daily parse Cal is showing him polling numbers that is showing his disapproval is getting lower and we know how much the president loves seeing polling numbers about his approval rating and they're talking on the phone they're hitting the road together and this is something that is you know Brad parse Cal's baby so to speak and he has to sort of sell his strategy to the President and that is reflected in the way they're communicating often and extensively about what to expect in 2020 and I know Axios is looking at a lot today what are you guys gonna be watching so today there are four primaries and different states happening across the country from Idaho to Pennsylvania there's a lot to keep up with but one thing I would suggest to viewers is to really focus on Pennsylvania there are 18 congressional races one Senate primary and those will sort of show I think whether or not we are truly in the year of the woman because there are 21 women running for the US House of Representatives in Pennsylvania all right Alexi McCammon for us thank you we're gonna be reading Axios a.m. in just a little bit and to all of our viewers out there you too can sign up for the newsletter at Axios com hey there I'm Chris Hayes from MSNBC thanks for watching MSNBC on youtube if you want to keep up to date with the videos we're putting out you can click subscribe just below me or click over on this list to see lots of other great videos
