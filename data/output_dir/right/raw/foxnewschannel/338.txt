1
00:00:04,871 --> 00:00:07,440
>> HE WAS VERY AGGRESSIVE, VERY

2
00:00:07,441 --> 00:00:07,873
SLOPPY.

3
00:00:07,874 --> 00:00:09,108
MEAN DRUNK.

4
00:00:09,109 --> 00:00:11,777
HE WOULD PUSH HIS BODY AGAINST

5
00:00:11,778 --> 00:00:12,945
THEIRS, GROPE THEM.

6
00:00:12,946 --> 00:00:14,747
>> THERE'S THINGS SHE TOLD US ON

7
00:00:14,748 --> 00:00:15,715
CAMERA THAT DIFFER FROM HER

8
00:00:15,716 --> 00:00:17,149
WRITTEN STATEMENT.

9
00:00:17,150 --> 00:00:19,719
ALL AFTERNOON, THE LITTLE LIES,

10
00:00:19,720 --> 00:00:21,554
LYING OVER AND OVER AGAINST HIS

11
00:00:21,555 --> 00:00:22,255
YEAR BOOK PAGE.

12
00:00:22,256 --> 00:00:24,257
>> I KNOW THAT IF HE GETS TO THE

13
00:00:24,258 --> 00:00:25,591
SUPREME COURT, A GOOD CHUNK OF

14
00:00:25,592 --> 00:00:26,792
THIS COUNTRY WILL THINK THAT

15
00:00:26,793 --> 00:00:28,194
SOMEBODY THAT GOT AWAY WITH

16
00:00:28,195 --> 00:00:31,330
SEXUAL ASSAULT IS SITTING ON THE

17
00:00:31,331 --> 00:00:32,531
SUPREME COURT.

18
00:00:32,531 --> 00:00:34,567
>> Ed: NEW CALLS FROM LEGAL

19
00:00:34,568 --> 00:00:35,835
EXPERTS URGING JUDGE KAVANAUGH

20
00:00:35,836 --> 00:00:37,703
TO TAKE ACTION AGAINST SOME OF

21
00:00:37,704 --> 00:00:39,338
THOSE UNCORROBORATED CLAIMS

22
00:00:39,339 --> 00:00:41,140
PUSHED IN THE MEDIA NIGHT AFTER

23
00:00:41,141 --> 00:00:41,874
NIGHT.

24
00:00:41,875 --> 00:00:43,576
ALLEGATIONS THAT KAVANAUGH SAYS

25
00:00:43,577 --> 00:00:46,412
HAVE RUINED HIS GOOD NAME.

26
00:00:46,413 --> 00:00:48,247
>> THIS HAS DESTROYED MY FAMILY

27
00:00:48,248 --> 00:00:50,316
AND MY GOOD NAME.

28
00:00:50,317 --> 00:00:52,952
A GOOD NAME BUILT UP THROUGH

29
00:00:52,953 --> 00:00:54,487
DECADES OF VERY HARD WORK AND

30
00:00:54,488 --> 00:00:57,556
PUBLIC SERVICE AT THE HIGHEST

31
00:00:57,557 --> 00:00:58,691
LEVELS OF THE AMERICAN

32
00:00:58,692 --> 00:01:01,694
GOVERNMENT.

33
00:01:01,695 --> 00:01:05,164
>> Ed: MY NEXT GUEST WRITING,

34
00:01:05,165 --> 00:01:06,465
UNSOLICITED ADVICE TO JUDGE

35
00:01:06,466 --> 00:01:08,868
KAVANAUGH, SUE THEM ALL.

36
00:01:08,869 --> 00:01:12,271
ATTORNEY ELLEN WOOD IS A

37
00:01:12,272 --> 00:01:14,140
REPUTATION PROTECTION EXPERT.

38
00:01:14,141 --> 00:01:14,573
GOOD EVENING.

39
00:01:14,574 --> 00:01:15,074
>> GOOD EVENING.

40
00:01:15,075 --> 00:01:16,375
>> Ed: YOU'VE HEARD THE

41
00:01:16,376 --> 00:01:17,310
ALLEGATIONS.

42
00:01:17,311 --> 00:01:18,878
YOU HEARD THEM ALL.

43
00:01:18,879 --> 00:01:22,081
WHAT IS MOST ACTIONABLE?

44
00:01:22,082 --> 00:01:23,716
CALLING SOMEONE A LIAR IS PAR

45
00:01:23,717 --> 00:01:25,618
FOR THE COURSE IN WASHINGTON.

46
00:01:25,619 --> 00:01:27,486
SLOP MY MEAN DRUNK, SOMEONE

47
00:01:27,487 --> 00:01:29,689
GUILTY OF SEXUAL ASSAULT WITHOUT

48
00:01:29,690 --> 00:01:30,489
EVIDENCE.

49
00:01:30,490 --> 00:01:32,191
WHAT DO YOU SEE IS ACTIONABLE?

50
00:01:32,192 --> 00:01:34,560
>> WELL, LET ME GIVE YOU AN

51
00:01:34,561 --> 00:01:34,894
EXAMPLE.

52
00:01:34,895 --> 00:01:37,630
WHEN NBC MADE THE DECISION TO

53
00:01:37,631 --> 00:01:40,666
PUT MRS. SWETNICK ON THEIR AIR,

54
00:01:40,667 --> 00:01:42,468
THEY ADMITTED THAT THEY COULD

55
00:01:42,469 --> 00:01:46,505
NOT CORROBORATE HER STORY.

56
00:01:46,506 --> 00:01:47,540
THAT'S RECKLESSNESS.

57
00:01:47,541 --> 00:01:49,542
AND WHEN YOU DO THAT, WHEN YOU

58
00:01:49,543 --> 00:01:57,416
PUT SOMEONE ON THE AIR TO MAKE

59
00:01:57,417 --> 00:02:00,886
ACCUSATIONS OF A HEINOUS CRIME,

60
00:02:00,887 --> 00:02:02,722
YOU OUGHT TO BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE

61
00:02:02,723 --> 00:02:03,689
FOR IT.

62
00:02:03,690 --> 00:02:06,425
>> Ed: YOU AND I BOTH KNOW "THE

63
00:02:06,426 --> 00:02:13,432
NEW YORK TIMES" VERSUS SULLIVAN,

64
00:02:13,433 --> 00:02:16,202
NBC WILL SAY WE WERE

65
00:02:16,203 --> 00:02:17,203
TRANSPARENT, WE COULDN'T CONFIRM

66
00:02:17,204 --> 00:02:19,472
IT BUT WE WERE AIRING IT AND

67
00:02:19,473 --> 00:02:20,272
TRYING TO GIVE JUDGE KAVANAUGH

68
00:02:20,273 --> 00:02:20,973
HIS SIDE.

69
00:02:20,974 --> 00:02:22,141
WHAT SAY YOU?

70
00:02:22,142 --> 00:02:24,977
>> I SAY THE SHOUT OF GUILTY IS

71
00:02:24,978 --> 00:02:27,179
NEVER OVERCOME BY THE GUILTY OF

72
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:27,546
INNOCENCE.

73
00:02:27,547 --> 00:02:30,149
NBC CAN DISCLAIM THEIR ACTIONS

74
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:32,752
OR EXPLAIN THEM AWAY BUT IT'S

75
00:02:32,753 --> 00:02:33,185
IRRESPONSIBLE.

76
00:02:33,186 --> 00:02:34,220
"NEW YORK TIMES" VERSUS

77
00:02:34,221 --> 00:02:34,587
SULLIVAN.

78
00:02:34,588 --> 00:02:36,822
I'M AWARE OF THAT DECISION.

79
00:02:36,823 --> 00:02:39,125
IT'S NOT EASY TO SUE IF YOU'RE A

80
00:02:39,126 --> 00:02:42,762
PUBLIC FIGURE TO PROVE ACTUAL

81
00:02:42,763 --> 00:02:43,729
MALICE.

82
00:02:43,730 --> 00:02:46,932
ACTUAL MALICE CAN GO WITH A

83
00:02:46,933 --> 00:02:54,140
RECKLESS DISREGARD FOR TRUTHITY.

84
00:02:54,141 --> 00:02:56,909
NBC ACTED RECKLESSLY AND DIDN'T

85
00:02:56,910 --> 00:02:59,011
HAVE ANY REGARD FOR TRUTH OR

86
00:02:59,012 --> 00:02:59,378
FALSITY.

87
00:02:59,379 --> 00:03:01,714
>> Ed: AND SHE ALLEGED AMONG

88
00:03:01,715 --> 00:03:04,417
OTHER THINGS, GANG RAPE.

89
00:03:04,418 --> 00:03:06,252
SHE COULDN'T PLACE JUDGE

90
00:03:06,253 --> 00:03:07,720
KAVANAUGH AS SOMEONE THERE.

91
00:03:07,721 --> 00:03:09,522
BUT HE MAY HAVE SPIKED THE

92
00:03:09,523 --> 00:03:11,557
PUNCH.

93
00:03:11,558 --> 00:03:16,929
HE VEHEMENTLY DENIES IT AND

94
00:03:16,930 --> 00:03:22,368
MICHAEL AVENATTI SAYS THAT IF

95
00:03:22,369 --> 00:03:24,370
THEY'RE ALL CONVINCED THAT MY

96
00:03:24,371 --> 00:03:27,072
CLIENT IS LYING, HE'S INNOCENT,

97
00:03:27,073 --> 00:03:29,942
HIS REPUTATION IS DAMAGED FOR NO

98
00:03:29,943 --> 00:03:32,011
REASON, HE SHOULD SUE US TODAY.

99
00:03:32,012 --> 00:03:34,180
I HOPE HE DOES SO SO WE CAN

100
00:03:34,181 --> 00:03:35,381
PROVE THE TRUTH.

101
00:03:35,382 --> 00:03:37,483
HE THINKS IF YOU OPEN THIS UP TO

102
00:03:37,484 --> 00:03:38,751
DISCOVERY, A JUSTICE ON THE

103
00:03:38,752 --> 00:03:40,386
SUPREME COURT DOESN'T WANT TO GO

104
00:03:40,387 --> 00:03:44,623
THROUGH DISCOVERY AND THAT

105
00:03:44,624 --> 00:03:45,491
PAINFUL PROCESS.

106
00:03:45,492 --> 00:03:47,593
>> MICHAEL AVENATTI WANTS TO BE

107
00:03:47,594 --> 00:03:49,028
SUED BECAUSE HE WANTS AN EXCUSE

108
00:03:49,029 --> 00:03:52,198
TO REMAIN RELEVANT IN THE PUBLIC

109
00:03:52,199 --> 00:03:55,367
EYE AS HE APPARENTLY CAMPAIGNS

110
00:03:55,368 --> 00:03:57,136
TO THE UNITED STATES.

111
00:03:57,137 --> 00:03:59,238
LOOK, THE BURDEN OF PROOF IT

112
00:03:59,239 --> 00:04:01,006
DOES FLIP THE SYSTEM ON ITS

113
00:04:01,007 --> 00:04:01,307
HEAD.

114
00:04:01,308 --> 00:04:02,975
NOT UNLIKE WHAT THEY TRIED TO DO

115
00:04:02,976 --> 00:04:05,878
TO JUDGE KAVANAUGH AND THE

116
00:04:05,879 --> 00:04:06,212
HEARING.

117
00:04:06,213 --> 00:04:08,481
WHEN YOU FILE A LIBEL LAWSUIT,

118
00:04:08,482 --> 00:04:10,149
YOU HAVE THE BURDEN OF PROOF.

119
00:04:10,150 --> 00:04:12,351
WHEN YOU HAVE AN ACCUSATION SO

120
00:04:12,352 --> 00:04:15,387
HEINOUS TO ACCUSE THIS MAN,

121
00:04:15,388 --> 00:04:17,890
BEING INVOLVED IN GANG RAPE,

122
00:04:17,891 --> 00:04:19,558
SEXUAL ASSAULT, SOMETIMES THE

123
00:04:19,559 --> 00:04:21,227
DECISION HAS TO BE THAT DOING

124
00:04:21,228 --> 00:04:23,562
NOTHING IS UNACCEPTABLE.

125
00:04:23,563 --> 00:04:24,830
I DON'T EXPECT JUDGE KAVANAUGH

126
00:04:24,831 --> 00:04:26,031
WILL FILE A LAWSUIT.

127
00:04:26,032 --> 00:04:28,000
HE WILL SPEND THE NEXT FEW YEARS

128
00:04:28,001 --> 00:04:29,268
HOPEFULLY WRITING SOME

129
00:04:29,269 --> 00:04:31,871
INCREDIBLE DECISIONS ON THE

130
00:04:31,872 --> 00:04:32,671
UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT AS

131
00:04:32,672 --> 00:04:34,540
OPPOSED TO BEING A LITIGANT IN A

132
00:04:34,541 --> 00:04:35,274
CIVIL LAWSUIT.

133
00:04:35,275 --> 00:04:37,209
BUT THAT DOESN'T CHANGE MY

134
00:04:37,210 --> 00:04:37,543
ADVICE.

135
00:04:37,544 --> 00:04:38,978
THE MESSAGE SHOULD BE SENT.

136
00:04:38,979 --> 00:04:40,045
PEOPLE NEEDS TO KNOW THERE NEEDS

137
00:04:40,046 --> 00:04:41,447
TO BE ACCOUNTABILITY.

138
00:04:41,448 --> 00:04:42,548
>> Ed: HOW DO YOU WEIGH THAT?

139
00:04:42,549 --> 00:04:43,549
THERE'S A COST BENEFIT.

140
00:04:43,550 --> 00:04:45,951
I HEAR YOU AND I SAY THIS MAN

141
00:04:45,952 --> 00:04:47,786
SAYS HIS REPUTATION WAS UNFAIRLY

142
00:04:47,787 --> 00:04:48,153
DESTROYED.

143
00:04:48,154 --> 00:04:48,921
HE SHOULD STAND UP.

144
00:04:48,922 --> 00:04:51,524
ON THE OTHER HAND AS YOU SAID,

145
00:04:51,525 --> 00:04:52,858
IF HE IS IN FACT CONFIRMED

146
00:04:52,859 --> 00:04:55,895
TOMORROW AS WE EXPECT AND WE'LL

147
00:04:55,896 --> 00:04:57,429
SEE IF THERE'S A SNAG, HE'S GOT

148
00:04:57,430 --> 00:04:59,064
MORE IMPORTANT BUSINESS TO DO.

149
00:04:59,065 --> 00:05:01,367
SHOULD HE BE WASTING TIME

150
00:05:01,368 --> 00:05:02,368
BECAUSE IT WOULDN'T BE A WASTE

151
00:05:02,369 --> 00:05:04,336
BUT YOU AND OTHERS BUT SHOULD HE

152
00:05:04,337 --> 00:05:05,704
SPEND TIME ON THE HIGH COURT

153
00:05:05,705 --> 00:05:07,106
DEALING WITH MICHAEL AVENATTI

154
00:05:07,107 --> 00:05:10,109
AND THE REST OR SHOULD HE JUST

155
00:05:10,110 --> 00:05:12,044
MOVE ON?

156
00:05:12,045 --> 00:05:14,013
>> I THINK HE HAS ACTIONABLE

157
00:05:14,014 --> 00:05:14,313
CASES.

158
00:05:14,314 --> 00:05:16,448
I WOULD RECOMMEND TO HIM THAT

159
00:05:16,449 --> 00:05:18,951
THEY HAVE MERIT.

160
00:05:18,952 --> 00:05:22,688
THE CLIENT HAS TO DECIDE THAT

161
00:05:22,689 --> 00:05:25,157
COST BENEFIT PRO AND CON

162
00:05:25,158 --> 00:05:25,524
ANALYSIS.

163
00:05:25,525 --> 00:05:27,726
IT WOULD BE UNDERSTANDABLE FOR

164
00:05:27,727 --> 00:05:29,361
HIM TO PUT ASIDE HIS RIGHT TO

165
00:05:29,362 --> 00:05:32,231
CLEAR HIS NAME IN A COURT OF LAW

166
00:05:32,232 --> 00:05:34,567
SO THAT HE CAN WORK FOR THE NEXT

167
00:05:34,568 --> 00:05:35,801
SEVERAL YEARS ON MAKING SURE

168
00:05:35,802 --> 00:05:37,269
THAT THE RIGHTS OF THE AMERICAN

169
00:05:37,270 --> 00:05:39,405
PUBLIC ARE ENFORCED UNDER THE

170
00:05:39,406 --> 00:05:39,838
CONSTITUTION.

171
00:05:39,839 --> 00:05:40,806
I CAN UNDERSTAND THE CHOICE.

172
00:05:40,807 --> 00:05:43,409
IT DOESN'T CHANGE THE FACT THAT

173
00:05:43,410 --> 00:05:46,178
THE PUBLIC NEEDS TO KNOW THAT

174
00:05:46,179 --> 00:05:47,580
EVEN WITH THE SUPREME COURT

175
00:05:47,581 --> 00:05:49,648
JUSTICE WE CANNOT TOLERATE THIS

176
00:05:49,649 --> 00:05:52,985
IDEA OF ACCUSATIONS THAT ARE

177
00:05:52,986 --> 00:05:55,087
UNSUPPORTED BEING TURNED INTO

178
00:05:55,088 --> 00:05:56,355
FINDINGS OF GUILT.

179
00:05:56,356 --> 00:05:58,390
UNSUPPORTED ACCUSATIONS CANNOT

180
00:05:58,391 --> 00:05:59,758
BE THE BASIS FOR SAYING THAT

181
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:01,293
SOMEONE IS GUILTY OF A CRIME.

182
00:06:01,294 --> 00:06:03,495
THERE'S GOT TO BE DUE PROCESS IN

183
00:06:03,496 --> 00:06:06,265
THIS COUNTRY, AND PEOPLE DON'T

184
00:06:06,266 --> 00:06:08,067
SEEM TO GIVE A LOT OF CREDENCE

185
00:06:08,068 --> 00:06:09,268
TO DUE PROCESS.

186
00:06:09,269 --> 00:06:10,369
I BELIEVE PEOPLE WOULD IF THE

187
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:12,004
TIME COMES WHERE THEY WANT TO

188
00:06:12,005 --> 00:06:14,907
RELY ON IT TO PROTECT THEIR

189
00:06:14,908 --> 00:06:17,610
REPUTATIONS AND THE REPUTATIONS

190
00:06:17,611 --> 00:06:19,345
OF THEIR FAMILY.

191
00:06:19,346 --> 00:06:20,679
>> Ed: HAVE YOU EVER SEEN WHAT

192
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:22,348
MANY HAVE BELIEVED TO BE A

193
00:06:22,349 --> 00:06:24,283
CHARACTER ASSASSINATION LIKE

194
00:06:24,284 --> 00:06:24,583
THIS?

195
00:06:24,584 --> 00:06:26,118
LIKE I SAID ON SOCIAL MEDIA,

196
00:06:26,119 --> 00:06:27,653
PEOPLE ARE ATTACKING EACH OTHER

197
00:06:27,654 --> 00:06:28,687
ALL THE TIME.

198
00:06:28,688 --> 00:06:30,856
HAVE YOU EVER SEEN ANYTHING LIKE

199
00:06:30,857 --> 00:06:31,156
THIS?

200
00:06:31,157 --> 00:06:33,025
>> IT'S GOTTEN A LOT WORSE, ED,

201
00:06:33,026 --> 00:06:34,793
BECAUSE OF THE SOCIAL MEDIA.

202
00:06:34,794 --> 00:06:37,329
I'LL TELL YOU WHAT THEY DID TO

203
00:06:37,330 --> 00:06:38,864
RICHARD JEWEL, GARY CONDITT.

204
00:06:38,865 --> 00:06:41,367
I'VE HAD A LOT OF CLIENTS WHERE

205
00:06:41,368 --> 00:06:44,303
THE ACCUSATIONS HAVE BEEN

206
00:06:44,304 --> 00:06:45,204
EGREGIOUS AND HEINOUS.

207
00:06:45,205 --> 00:06:46,605
THIS PROBABLY TAKES THE CAKE.

208
00:06:46,606 --> 00:06:48,674
THIS IS PROBABLY THE WORST CASE

209
00:06:48,675 --> 00:06:51,343
OF SUSTAINED ACCUSATIONS AGAINST

210
00:06:51,344 --> 00:06:54,079
A MAN WITH AN IMPECCABLE LIFE

211
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:55,514
HISTORY AS AN ADULT.

212
00:06:55,515 --> 00:06:57,983
I'VE NEVER SEEN THE MEDIA STOOP

213
00:06:57,984 --> 00:06:59,485
TO THIS LEVEL OF RECKLESSNESS.

214
00:06:59,486 --> 00:07:02,721
THEY NEED TO BE HELD

215
00:07:02,722 --> 00:07:03,122
ACCOUNTABLE.

216
00:07:03,123 --> 00:07:04,757
IF NOT IN THIS CASE, IN ANOTHER

217
00:07:04,758 --> 00:00:00,000
CASE IF THEY DO IT AGAIN.
