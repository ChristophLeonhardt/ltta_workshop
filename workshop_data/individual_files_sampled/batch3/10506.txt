a rise in violent crime in Germany's Lower Saxony region is being linked to an increase in migrants in the government back study but is it really that simple porous layer takes a look why have reports of violent crime in one German state increased by more than 10 percent in the last two years all this is exactly what a group of criminologist at Zurich University of Applied Science set out to find and what they established is that there is a link between the increased violent crimes in Lower Saxony and the influx of migrants but the authors say there are a number of important contributing factors the first and foremost is the age of the migrants most are men between the ages of 14 and 30 now generally speaking people in this age bracket are more likely to commit acts of a violent nature than people in other age groups secondly where they come from is important migrants who come from Syria Iraq and Afghanistan tend not to carry out the same number of violent acts as migrants for example that are coming from North Africa and then third what is also relevant is the fact that there is a lack of women among the migrants only 1/4 of migrants are female which means that you have groups of young men without their wives their mothers or their sisters and they are more likely to carry out the acts of a violent nature now these findings do reflect earlier reporting that suggests that there is an increase in acts of a violent nature that are connected to the migrant crisis since 2015 more than a million migrants have arrived here in Germany but say the authors there is an important mitigating factor and this is and it could be that people may be more likely to report acts violent acts that are carried out by migrants then if they were carried out by local Germans now criminologists believe that only integration isn't a solution and to bring down the high level of crime rates a migrants from our point of view the study shows once again that we must not abandon those who come to us but actively provide integration that means for example compulsory and comprehensive integration and language courses more places in kitten gardens in schools let's ask people here in Berlin what they think I think I would say that this is coming from both sides the more people that come the more the dissatisfaction will be from those who have lived here longer I think that's something that should be driven by politics but then at the end of the day it's to us it's a partisan society that we all need to change and integrate people better by changing our behavior one of the more radical solutions would be to deport the immigrants from Germany integration is tough it's all day they need to work at some point being an immigrant and working is a different story we kind of try to - yeah get them get them something worthwhile to do wireless solution to the problem continues to be sought the sad reality is that a violent crimes continue Paulus Lea RT Berlin well the chairman of the Vice pardon academy for integration believes the same behavioural patterns can be found actually among any group regardless of whether they have a migrant background or not what is written in the report is basically a common sense that people without any perspective with the living standards which are very hard are more common to go into the thinking about criminal activities if we talk about integration of immigrants it's a dialogue and from the one side for integration you have to build perspectives and give them the chance to be one part of this society but on the other hand you have to hear the worries about the Germans and find together with those people who have worries solutions which can help for a better future together
