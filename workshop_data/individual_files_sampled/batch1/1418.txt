in 2016 concerned that leaving the EU might result in chaos were dismissed as project fear by brexit supporters but with just 5 months to go until Britain leaves the EU and still no agreement on the terms of departure millions of people are now very afraid indeed not for my generation yes we're going to be completely stuffed with this but for my children's future and my grandchildren's future we could have all of our rights taken away we could have all of our trade deals taken and for students we are vulnerable to that and it's all futures that are going to be destroyed before the bat this was a massive turnout people came from all over the UK to attend and the crowd was at least 5 times larger than the 100000 originally predicted by the organisers there was a significantly smaller Pro brexit event in the northern town of Harrogate on Saturday Nigel Farage urging the prime minister to just get on with it the evidence suggests about a third of those that voted remain now say we're Democrats so we think the government should simply get on with it and that's our message get on with it fulfill your promises to us you've said if we voted to leave it would happen it needs to but what is it the people's vote campaigners say the it promised and voted for in 2016 is not what's going to be delivered in March next year as the weeks and months pass with no agreed brexit deal the pressure for a people's vote is growing but what's uncertain is whether the government will actually grant a people's vote and what the question will be if they do once they've given us the vote then we can argue about what the question should be and without question it should be do you want to devastate the United Kingdom and create catastrophic consequences for the economy or do you want to say near you the option to stay in the EU will definitely be on the ballot paper because it is Parliament itself that will decide what the question is the Prime Minister is still refusing to hold another referendum and the opposition Labour Party seems reluctant to force one but the pressure from the voting public may yet force their hand Paul Brennan al Jazeera central London
