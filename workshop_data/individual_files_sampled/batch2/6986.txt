after George papadopolis pleaded guilty in the FBI investigation into possible Russian interference in this past election Donald Trump and his team essentially said well Papadopoulos wasn't really an important part of our campaign she's the coffee boy not a big deal of course in the past Trump had referred to Papadopoulos as a quote great guy and there was this photo take a look at graphic 38 where Papadopoulos is right there sitting at a table with Donald Trump and it seems as though he's more than just a coffee boy well now we have interesting comments coming from his fiancee her name is Simona man jayante and she is not a US citizen she's apparently an Italian citizen but she wanted to speak up about this whole situation because she has some inside information about what Papadopoulos relationship with the Trump team really was like and she's not pleased with the coffee boy comments so let's get right to it let's watch the first video here she is speaking to ABC Professor Joseph Smith stood the man described in court records as an overseas professor with substantial connections to Russian government officials who told Papadopoulos about Russians possessing dirt on Hillary Clinton in the form of thousands of emails so you've known professor Massoud for some time for several years more than George so if it turns out he was working for the Russian government doesn't sound like you'd be surprised no absolutely not do you think he sought out George because George was working for the Trump presidential campaign I know that he was interested in George because he was working for Trump okay so that's part one let's take a look at the next video George is a remarkable a young man with an incredible experience in the professional experience in the field of energy and the oil policies this experience led him to get into the campaign and to advise the president at only 28 years old he set up meetings with leaders all over the world it was constantly in touch with a high-level official campaign and it never took any initiative as far as I know unauthorized constantly in touch you say with members of the campaign was he in touch with the chief strategist Steve Bannon yes as far as I know yes I know it's him Bannon Michael Flynn he was in touch with Michael Flynn general Flynn yes as well and this is by email by phone being based in London was some miscommunication where via email so you're saying he had communications with top levels of the campaign yes everything he was doing is with the knowledge of those officials as far as I know absolutely yes I never took any initiative without the blessing of the campaign and and you believe that he can demonstrate that absolutely yes I know this is a weird story why she why is the girlfriend of Papadopoulos so I'm gonna ABC News she said at one point that she had seen correspondence between Papadopoulos and Steve banning a Michael Flynn why why is he showing you that that's super weird and then then FBI decided that okay that they're that like she's not involved and and why does she know that same Russian guy every part of this story is super weird look I I think I agree with you there's something a little shady about what's going on but I also do know that pillow talk happens right and so that's that's his fiancee so she has some pretty interesting insight that she wants to share now I don't know how much of it is is true how much of it is accurate but I do think look I am inclined and again this is just my opinion I'm inclined to believe that Papadopoulos had a much larger role within the Trump campaign than just bringing people coffee or being a coffee boy that I mean minimizing his role was you know a play by the Trump team to make it seem as though they knew nothing about all this communication with the Russians I not buy enough she is she is responding to their having belittled his role at all and she hearing that around and goes are you kidding me all the things that he did for you and you're just gonna throw him under the bus and cut him off from all of you guys he was he did so many things that you asked him to do that's that's at least the intuitive thing for me is her trying to make him either seem more important that he was sure why not but also if if she logically to me if she heard them trying to you know throw him under the bus she just wants to reestablish the fact that he did play an integral role and you wouldn't have had any of those meetings that you all were asking about if it weren't for George doing what George does best and by the way she also talks about how Trump is unlikely to be a fan of what Papadopoulos will expose to the investigators so I want to go I want to I don't know it helps it helps him if what he is a it helps Papadopoulos if what he is able to give the government on the rest of the Trump campaign is important right yeah ends up being important so she wants to underscore that that through-line so look I think Trump did it we've discussed it a million times so I should be happy that she's coming out and saying that he was a really important player in the Trump campaign there's something off about super weird yeah my radar is going off so take whatever she's saying with a grain of salt so so look a couple of things of course he wasn't a coffee boy he was you know another hand me he wasn't in line to become Secretary of State either so but we know what he did I don't know why we need this we know what he did he because he's told the FBI already told a special counselor already which is he was supposed to set up meetings with the Russians that's bad enough I don't need his girlfriend to tell me that but we need a femme fatale in the story that's what I think it is okay I want to show you one more video um because she talks about Trump specifically and I think it's interesting take a look how surprised do you think I and everyone watching at home will be when they learn the whole story I think it's a it's very interesting that George will write a book about it and really saying is idle sorry giving it more details about what's happening with the president from what you know will the president be happy with the story George tells I I don't I mean I think it's right to dismiss George as a coffee boy so I'm sure not to be happy to to read that there are consistent evidences that it was not a coffee boy of course he wasn't a coffee boy he was in the meetings where he said hey do you want me to go talk to the Russians to set up a meeting with Trump and the Russians some said yeah that'll be awesome and apparently a session said no don't do that then later forgot that he said that it's just it's just such a soap opera that's what it plays out as and the Trump administration wants you to feel like he is the guy and I don't know if in True Lies bill Paxton's character who's like trying to tell someone that he is that he is like this secret agent spy when really is just a used-car salesman like that's what the Trump administration wants you to believe is that these this couple is a bunch of try-hards who want to get their names in the papers when really they weren't doing anything but on the other hand what if those try-hards were exactly the kind of people that the Trump administration needed in order to accomplish the goals that they set out because the whole campaign was a bunch of trihard a bunch of misfits who got thrown out there there have been write-ups in The New York Times about lobbyists who end up ended up now having a huge role on K Street when really they couldn't even get a phone call before but it turned out they knew one of the rejects that ended up being in power in the Trump campaign apparatus that's what it is and it would be interesting to see as this all plays out what actually the story was because I think it will be a mix of soap opera and like actual intrigue yeah and I just like to correct one thing that Ana said you said that Trump had called hit Papadopoulos a gray card guy fake news he called Owen excellent guy if you like The Young Turks you'll love Young Turks membership TYT Network dot-com sighs
