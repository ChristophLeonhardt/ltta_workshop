for 27 years in prison Nelson Mandela's communications with the outside world consisted mainly of letters written from his prison cell words were his principal means of keeping alive friendships and family ties religious faith and political conviction our cause is just it is a fight for human dignity and for an honorable life often heavily censored or never delivered at all most of the letters appear in a new volume of Mandela's prison writings launched in Johannesburg this week many published for the first time offer new insights into one of the world's most famous figures during some of his darkest times one of those milestone books that will open a chapter of how wars need not restrict our vision that freedom didn't just come for free it was tough that Madiba too felt the pain my deepest message is one we can all learn from that we all need to do something good in the world and wherever we live wherever we are to make sure that this kind of life that he had to live through will never happen again some of Mandela's captors became confidants others proxies for the wider struggle against South Africa's apartheid government I should like us to fight over principles and ideas and without personal hatred so at the end of the battle whatever the results might be I can proudly shake hands with you a recurring theme is the pain of family separation the father of five who missed the funeral of his eldest son and wasn't allowed visits from his toddler daughters until they turned 16 do not worry about me now I am happy well and full of strength and hope the only thing I long for is you in meticulous handwriting after their mother Winnie was arrested yet again Mandela offers the support of an absent parent my darlings once again our beloved mummy has been arrested and now she and daddy are away in jail she gave up pleasure and comfort in return for a life full of hardship and misery because of the deep love she has for her people and her country the letter concludes we have a lot of friends and they will look after you and one day mummy and daddy will return Jonah hull al-jazeera
