PRESIDENT TO FAIL AT ALL COSTS.
WE WILL EXPLAIN ALL OF THIS IN A
VERY IMPORTANT BREAKING NEWS
OPENING MONOLOGUE.
ALL RIGHT.
IT IS NOW DAY 352 OF MUELLER'S
WITCHHUNT.
STILL ZERO EVIDENCE.
A FEDERAL JUDGE COURAGEOUSLY
STANDING UP TO THIS TOTALLY OUT

CAMPAIGN, THE JUDGE ASKED.
LET ME TELL YOU, FOLKS, WE'RE
ALL FIGHTING BATTLES, BUT I LOVE
