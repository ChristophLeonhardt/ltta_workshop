surge to the polls having one of their largest midterm primary election turnouts in the state in more than 16 years but far more Republican voters showed up at the polls across the state than usual as well joining us now national political correspondent for NBC News and MSNBC Steve Kornacki he's live at the big board and in Austin Texas professor at the lyndon b johnson school of public affairs at the university of texas MSNBC contributor Victoria DeFrancesco Soto Steve we will start with you as you're dressed in your casual Kornacki chic which we always like to see it means it's been a big election night what are your big takeaways from Texas yeah let's start on that issue would turnout look this is sort of the first statewide primary the 28th midterm season a lot of questions here were we gonna see a big surge on the Democratic side maybe signs of not so much energy on the Republican side well okay they go to the top of the ballot yesterday the gubernatorial race statewide primary they weren't great primaries but you get a sense of how many ballots were cast on each side and looking at one point five million Republican bouts that's the most in primary history in Texas Republicans broke their own record this Democratic number is over a million that is up significantly from what Democrats have been getting in the past but if you look at that gap yeah it's about 60% of the ballots cast yesterday where Republicans whoa that wasn't supposed to happen about 60% were Republican about 40% were Democrats historically what does that mean that puts Democrats in better shape than they were in 2014 in 2010 those were very bad midterm years for them not as good shape as they were in though in 2006 that was a great midterm year for them maybe if you go all the way back to 2002 well 2002 Democrats actually had more ballots cast than Republicans in Texas so that's one thing we're keeping an eye on another thing we were looking at here too is some of these congressional primaries where Democrats think they have a chance to not go off Republicans one in particular this is in the seventh district this is suburban Houston this is a Republican district and what was so interesting about this Democratic primary national Democrats panicked about that low that also wasn't supposed to happen let me try that one more time National Democrats and see if we can get that up this is where you start breaking stuff there we go Laura Moser national Democrats tried to sink her campaign they said look she's probably had been living in Washington just move the stated wrote a disparaging comments about living in Texas well there was a backlash to what the National Democrats tried to do now look there's runoffs in Texas she's gonna be in the runoff if you look at the votes that were just cast yesterday on Election Day she did much better than in the early vote looks like clear signs of a backlash there so that's one to keep an eye on Markey race one of the closest nationally for the house national Democrats don't like this candidate but voters in the district may that's something and very quickly of course you got the Senate primary this fall you're gonna have a Roarke Cruz mmm 62% for o'rourke in a primary he was supposed to win very easily that number may not be as exciting as Democrats we're hoping for there hey so so Steve it looks like reports that we've been hearing leading and talking about registration and early voting Democrats up 105 percent Republicans up 10% looks like a lot of those reports about a big blue wave coming in Texas once again overhyped and I say once again because we've been hearing about of the coming blue wave in Texas now for about as long as we heard about the the coming red wave in Pennsylvania up until Donald Trump's win to date it's been the great white whale of democratic politics the idea of flipping Texas blue I will say look that the turnout is a sign of clear energy on the Democratic side again for Democrats in Texas that's a phenomenal number but again for Republicans that also shatters a record I think the other lesson from this too though is look when we talk about the early vote take it with a gigantic grain of salt in the future this is one of the big lessons the last few elections in Texas all those reports about early votes one thing to keep in mind the numbers are only counted when they do these early vote release totals they're only counted in the in the run-up to election day in the top 15 counties that's when you're usually seeing in the news top 15 counties in terms of population much more democratic so that's going to skew things right there so again look if you're a Democrat and you just said you're gonna get more than a million votes yesterday I think you're happy but if you're a Republican and you broke the record you're not upset about that either okay so Victor thanks for checking out MSNBC on YouTube and make sure you subscribe to stay
