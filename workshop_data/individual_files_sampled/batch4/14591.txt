there is something of a stereotype when it comes to oscar-nominated movies in what they look like it's either an epic masterpiece or a boundary-pushing controversial small film or even a heartfelt indie well Lady Bird may fall into the last category and may be a conservative movie please do not tell anyone that's voting in the Academy I'm Ben Davies this is pure Hollywood ladybird was directed by Greta Gerwig who is in fact a woman and this has been talked about at nauseam like I don't know why they want to just not say that this is the best directed movie period but no it has to be the best female directed movie which i think is stupid and inane gender-neutral category it should just be Best Picture and I'm sure Greta would like to be known as just the best director period not just the best woman director hopefully they don't try to politicize it and she definitely deserves to be nominated it was a great movie this movie was also received very well receiving 99% on Rotten Tomatoes and the budget was only ten million dollars but still grossed almost fifty million dollars in the box office so this was a big big success but was it a good movie my viewer review is a 5 out of 5 now this is definitely not my cup of tea kind of movie in fact it's not even my shot of whiskey which is always better anyway which is why I'm gonna definitely give it a five out of five and not a four out of five now this movie feels a little bit to me like Slumdog Millionaire a movie that I actually like a little bit more that did really well the Oscars as well including winning Best Picture on that is because the characters are very relatable to situations are believable and there is a tangible heartbeat to this movie itself as you watch it now the characters are deeply and wonderfully drawn by Greta and this allows you to care as you go on this quirky coming-of-age tale for an hour and a half this movie is emotional it's funny it's entertaining it's surprisingly deep and it is for a cyst for a quirky kind of commie coming-of-age tale it is suspiciously real as you go through and watch this story unfold my critic review is a four out of five this is a clinic on no dead weight in a movie the hardest thing to create the hardest thing to do as a director a writer is to cut down your story every single moment and look and scene feels like you're amputating your arm when you get to the cutting room floor and have to condense it but it's the most important thing in trying to get a story that everyone can relate to that doesn't bore anyone and this movie took everything out because all the moments are small and intimate and perfectly done every joke and emotional point lands because you're not bogged down by anything the dialogue is some of the best too I've ever heard particularly between Lady Bird and her mother it is so real and relatable and quick and specific I it's a testament and to her writing and the creation of this story in the characters my performance award goes to I hope I'm saying this right sorce Ronan and Laurie Metcalf both who are actually nominated for the Oscar for their performances as lead actress and support actress for their roles my faith in values is a four out of five now this does not mean this is a take your kid to the movie to watch kind of piece no please don't do this is a lot of stuff in the movie a lot of language sexual moments a lot of graphic stuff to just it's not that kind of movie and neither that kind of faith and values but what I love is that the values are great the significance and importance of religion is there and it's told through the eyes of the youth and this is great because of course when we're young and stupid we're more liberal and when we're older more wise we're conservative but the picture of struggles temptation are not diminished and downplayed in the movie it is very real when you watch it the mother is particularly hard to be around at times for sure but it is great when the best scenes the movie is when you get to see her backstory she's arguing with Lady Bird about cleaning up a room and saying she needs to put away her stuff she doesn't respect anything I was gonna stuff Lady Bird is a most in tears and she's like has it didn't your mom ever like lets you not put every single piece of clothing perfectly in your drawer and she just looked at her and she's like my mother was an abusive alcoholic and then leaves and it's so great to set the backstory of her mother being you know portrayed on to the daughter now even though the daughter never actually cleans her room the entire time it's constantly dirty because it's an issue that she really has but yes the mother is a little bit overbearing but there's also a reason for that and you get to see still the love and the respect for one another because everyone still says your mother is awesome she loves you that's the fact that she is paying attention that shows her intense love for you and the brothers girl from the movie is like you should do the sacrifice you she made for me she does even know me she took me in did all the stuff it is great to see yes these are real these conflicts are real and they're important but with the big picture of it you can still see that these are so important like the family the values being together loving each other caring about each other it was still it doesn't offset the fact that there are still issues that we go through Lady Bird also acting out in school is completely understandable these adolescent situations and they were funny it's quirky it's real stuff we've all seen all been through all this kind of stuff and is done seamlessly and so fast it is so artful the way that they showed all of them however what I love about it is that though all these acts you can see they're almost justified like of course I would want to do that too I want to reach out here or rebelle here but what's great is it never glorifies any of those actions those consequences those decisions she made never live up to the beautiful expectation of what it's really going to be about it doesn't glorify premarital sex even though it says that obviously it shows that it does happen it's in there gonna be as good as you think it is it's going to be or as beneficial as you think it's gonna be no nothing that she does to act out actually ends up being great for her one of the best parts of this movie to me though is still how it wraps up you get to see a girl whose dream was to get out and have things to be happy when she does she finally makes it to New York out of her small towns at this college and for a moment not the entire time but for a moment she finally understands and appreciates everything that she had in this small town everything she took for granted her family her relationships and even yes even the religious upbringing all these values that were so important to her when she finally sees the forest for the trees somewhere else when she finally crosses that fence to the other side and sees the grass is not greener over here and you get to see that appreciation and understanding for those values and his principles and how important they really are I truly do hope that this movie does well because it seems to be one of the few movies that has not been nominated or potentially nominated for its political slant and bias I'm Ben Davies this is pure Hollywood and another fantastic news you can now download the rebel up and take me with you wherever you go to get exclusive content and the entire rebel lineup you
