Laura: IT'S TIME FOR OUR "SEEN AND UNSEEN" SEGMENT WHERE WE EXPOSE WHAT'S BEHIND THE BIG CULTURAL STORIES OF THE DAY. WE KICK OFF TODAY'S EDITION WAS SOMETHING SO RIDICULOUS THAT IT HAS TO BE SEEN TO BELIEVED. THIS IS A CANDIDATE FOR CONGRESS MAKING A COMPLETE BUFFOON OF HIMSELF IN A DESPERATE BID FOR VOTES. HERETO FOR FILL US IN IS THE AUTHOR OF THE BEST-SELLING AUTHOR SERIES WILL WHILE KEEP HE FEELS CONGRESS HAS BEEN TALKING OVER EACH OTHER IN REGARD TO SCHOOL SAFETY. THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION WOULD LIKE TO ARM TEACHERS. TILLMAN HAS A DIFFERENT APPROACH AND HE DEMONSTRATES IT. AND POWER SCHOOLS AND TEACHERS WITH NONLETHAL SELF DEFENSE TOOLS, LIKE THIS CAN OF PEPPER SPRAY. TRUST ME, THIS. ANYONE. IN THEIR TRACKS. NOW I JUST CAN'T SEE ANYTHING. FOR LESS THAN $1 PER PERSON IN THE U.S., WE CAN HAVE A SECURE CANISTER OF PEPPER SPRAY IN EVERY CLASSROOM IN AMERICA. IT'S UNBEARABLE, IT'S LIKE A LULLABY YOUR EYES. THE AD IS LIKE A LULLABY IN EYES. THANK GOD HE IS NOT A WILD GAME ADVOCATE. HE WOULD BE SETTING OFF BEAR TRAPS AND BLEEDING ALL OVER THE FLOOR. Laura: HE LOOKS LIKE HE IS WATERBOARDING HIMSELF. IN THE END I WANTED TO SPRAY MYSELF WITH PEPPER SPRAY SO I DIDN'T HAVE TO WATCH. HE COULD HAVE A NEW SHOW CALLED THE CANDIDATES AGAINST THE WORLD. HE COULD BREATHE IN CARBON MONOXIDE, DRINK TOILET WATER Laura: AND THERE IS A CERTAIN TYPE OF BLACK SPIDER THAT'S ON THE ENDANGERED SPECIES SO I'M LIVING WITH HIM. AND, HE'S A DEMOCRATIC CANDIDATE FOR A HOUSE SEAT IN COLORADO. Laura: DISTURBING. SO WHAT'S GOING ON WITH THE BISHOP OF TUCSON? AT ONE POINT, THE BISHOP OF TUCSON, ARIZONA, AS YOU MENTIONED, EDWARD WEISS AND BERGER SEEM TO MORALLY EQUATE THOSE ENFORCING THE BORDER WITH PEOPLE COMMITTING ABORTIONS. SPEAKING ABOUT BORDER SECURITY THAT TAKES THE PART IN SEPARATING FAMILIES. WATCH. IN LIGHT OF THE PENALTIES THAT ARE THERE FOR LIFE ISSUES, I'M SIMPLY ASKING THE QUESTION IF PERHAPS OUR AFFAIRS COMMITTEE COULD GIVE RECOMMENDATIONS TO THOSE OF US WHO ARE BORDER BISHOPS ON THE POSSIBILITY OF CANONICAL PENALTIES FOR CATHOLICS WHO ARE INVOLVED IN THIS. FOR THE SALVATION OF THESE PEOPLE'S SOULS. MAYBE IT IS TIME FOR US TO LOOK AT CANONICAL PENALTIES. MAYBE IT'S TIME FOR YOU TO READ A CANON LAW. WHAT IS HE TALKING ABOUT? CANONICAL PENALTIES MEAN RESCINDING THE SACRAMENTS. I GOT A CALL FROM SOME BORDER SECURITY GUYS. I SAID WHEN NANCY PELOSI GETS THE LETTER OF RESIGNATION YOU CAN WORRY. BUT THE PACK CATHOLIC W BUT THE PACK CATHOLIC E BUT THE PACK CATHOLIC H BUT THE PACK CATHOLIC V BUT THE PACK CATHOLIC E BUT THE PACK CATHOLIC T BUT THE PACK CATHOLIC O BUT THE PACK CATHOLIC C BUT THE PACK CATHOLIC M BUT THE PACK CATHOLIC E BUT THE PACK CATHOLIC U BUT THE PACK CATHOLIC P WITH POLICIES THAT DON'T INCENTIVIZE PEOPLE TO SEND THEIR CHILDREN ALONE ACROSS THE BORDER CHILDREN ALONE ACROSS THE BORDE BORDER. THAT'S WHAT'S HAPPENING NOW. AND THAT'S HAPPENING IN YOUR HOME COUNTRY AND HERE. AND ORDERLY. ALL RIGHT, WHAT DOES GOD LOOK LIKE? 60 SECONDS. THE UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA DID A STUDY, FIVE YEARS AND 11 AMERICANS. THIS IS WHAT THEY THINK GOD LOOKS LIKE. Laura: THAT LOOKS LIKE OE OF THE GUYS IN THE CONTROL ROOM IN NEW YORK. IT'S NICK ROBERTSON, HE IS BASICALLY A NICE WHITE GUY. NO. PEOPLE TEND TO PROJECT THEIR IMAGE AND THEIR BELIEFS ONTO THEIR IMAGE OF GOD. SO I THOUGHT, I WOULD WE DEFINE GOD? SO I CAME UP WITH MY OWN IMAGES. HERE IS WHAT I THINK. FRANK SINATRA AND JOHN HOUSTON IN THE GREATEST STORY. NOW YOUR PICKS. Laura: MY PICKS ARE CHARLTON HESTON THAT SEEMS LIKE GOD. GOD CAN'T LOOK LIKE THE KID IN THE APPLE COMMERCIAL, LIKE MACINTOSH VERSUS PC. THAT'S LIKE A MILLENNIAL THING. LIKE GOD HAS SKINNY JEANS, A MAN BUN AND HE IS ALSO A BOY. WE WANT A GUY WITH SOME AUTHORITY AND GRAVITAS BUT I THINK WE CAN AGREE THAT GOD DOES NOT LOOK LIKE THIS. Laura: THESE TWO. I NEVER BOUGHT EITHER ONE OF THOSE. YOU WANT GOD TO SOUND LIKE HIM. GEORGE BURNS WAS HILARIOUS. WE DON'T WANT GOD TO SOUND
