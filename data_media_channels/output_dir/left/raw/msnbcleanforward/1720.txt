THE KOCHS WILL CERTAINLY NOT HAVE THE TYPE OF WHITE HOUSE

165
00:04:59,535 --> 00:05:01,093
HAVE THE TYPE OF WHITE HOUSE THAT WOULD BE ABLE TO FUNCTION

166
00:05:01,137 --> 00:05:02,728
THAT WOULD BE ABLE TO FUNCTION PROPERLY IF THEY CARRIED ABOUT

167
00:05:02,739 --> 00:05:03,596
PROPERLY IF THEY CARRIED ABOUT LIBERTARIAN VALUES.

168
00:05:03,606 --> 00:05:05,631
LIBERTARIAN VALUES. WITH THAT SAID, THIS REALLY

169
00:05:05,675 --> 00:05:07,433
WITH THAT SAID, THIS REALLY SHOWS WHAT PEOPLE LIKE STEVE

170
00:05:07,443 --> 00:05:10,536
SHOWS WHAT PEOPLE LIKE STEVE BANNON AND OTHERS AND TRUMP WAS

171
00:05:10,546 --> 00:05:10,870
BANNON AND OTHERS AND TRUMP WAS ARGUING.

172
00:05:10,913 --> 00:05:13,339
ARGUING. I CAN TELL YOU THIS IS WHAT WE

173
00:05:13,382 --> 00:05:16,375
I CAN TELL YOU THIS IS WHAT WE TALKED ABOUT WITH TRUMP, HOW THE

174
00:05:16,419 --> 00:05:18,144
TALKED ABOUT WITH TRUMP, HOW THE KOCH BROTHERS WON, WERE GOING TO

175
00:05:18,154 --> 00:05:20,513
KOCH BROTHERS WON, WERE GOING TO GO AGAINST HIM, AND NUMBER TWO,

176
00:05:20,523 --> 00:05:22,148
GO AGAINST HIM, AND NUMBER TWO, THE BASE OF THE DEMOCRAT PARTY

177
00:05:22,191 --> 00:05:23,383
THE BASE OF THE DEMOCRAT PARTY ON THE OTHER SIDE DOES NOT LIKE

178
00:05:23,426 --> 00:05:25,351
ON THE OTHER SIDE DOES NOT LIKE THIS BIG MONEY.

179
00:05:25,361 --> 00:05:28,054
THIS BIG MONEY. THE KOCHS ARE WHINING BECAUSE

180
00:05:28,097 --> 00:05:29,155
THE KOCHS ARE WHINING BECAUSE THEY DON’T LIKE THE PRESIDENT’S

181
00:05:29,165 --> 00:05:30,156
THEY DON’T LIKE THE PRESIDENT’S TRADE POLICIES.

182
00:05:30,166 --> 00:05:32,859
TRADE POLICIES. >> LET ME GO TO YOU, SAM, AND

183
00:05:32,869 --> 00:05:34,160
>> LET ME GO TO YOU, SAM, AND THEN HOWARD, THERE DOES SEEM TO

184
00:05:34,170 --> 00:05:35,495
THEN HOWARD, THERE DOES SEEM TO BE OVERLAP OF AGREEMENT, AND A

185
00:05:35,538 --> 00:05:38,331
BE OVERLAP OF AGREEMENT, AND A LOT OF PEOPLE WOULD NOT EXPECT

186
00:05:38,341 --> 00:05:38,865
LOT OF PEOPLE WOULD NOT EXPECT THAT FROM BOTH OF YOU.

187
00:05:38,908 --> 00:05:41,935
THAT FROM BOTH OF YOU. WHAT YOU’RE BOTH GETTING AT SD

188
00:05:41,978 --> 00:05:43,569
WHAT YOU’RE BOTH GETTING AT SD IDEA, WE SHOWED THE VIDEOS, AND

189
00:05:43,613 --> 00:05:45,137
IDEA, WE SHOWED THE VIDEOS, AND THEY’RE WELCOME TO COME ON "THE

190
00:05:45,181 --> 00:05:46,039
THEY’RE WELCOME TO COME ON "THE BEAT" AT ANY TIME, THEIR

191
00:05:46,049 --> 00:05:48,274
BEAT" AT ANY TIME, THEIR ARGUMENT IS THAT THEY ARE

192
00:05:48,285 --> 00:05:49,275
ARGUMENT IS THAT THEY ARE IDEOLOGICAL ON THE RIGHT AND

193
00:05:49,285 --> 00:05:50,643
IDEOLOGICAL ON THE RIGHT AND THAT’S WHY THEY DO THINGS.

194
00:05:50,653 --> 00:05:52,378
THAT’S WHY THEY DO THINGS. VIEWERS HAVE HEARD GOVERNOR DEAN

195
00:05:52,421 --> 00:05:55,214
VIEWERS HAVE HEARD GOVERNOR DEAN AND NOW YOU, SAM, SAY THAT’S NOT

196
00:05:55,258 --> 00:05:55,548
AND NOW YOU, SAM, SAY THAT’S NOT TRUE.

197
00:05:55,558 --> 00:05:57,683
TRUE. THEY ARE JUST A CORPORATE ENTITY

198
00:05:57,694 --> 00:05:59,185
THEY ARE JUST A CORPORATE ENTITY THAT IS JUST DOING WHAT’S GOOD

199
00:05:59,229 --> 00:06:00,453
THAT IS JUST DOING WHAT’S GOOD FOR THEIR BOTTOM LINE.

200
00:06:00,497 --> 00:06:02,255
FOR THEIR BOTTOM LINE. BUT THAT DOESN’T SOUND GOOD IN

201
00:06:02,265 --> 00:06:02,589
BUT THAT DOESN’T SOUND GOOD IN POLITICS.

202
00:06:02,632 --> 00:06:06,493
POLITICS. SO THEY’VE BUILT A FOE OR FAKE

203
00:06:06,503 --> 00:06:07,394
SO THEY’VE BUILT A FOE OR FAKE CONSERVATISM AROUND THAT.

204
00:06:07,404 --> 00:06:10,163
CONSERVATISM AROUND THAT. A VERITABLE CANDY SHELL WHEN THE

205
00:06:10,206 --> 00:06:12,665
A VERITABLE CANDY SHELL WHEN THE REAL ACTION IS IN THE -- IN THE

206
00:06:12,676 --> 00:06:13,400
REAL ACTION IS IN THE -- IN THE CARAMEL CENTER WHERE ALL THE

207
00:06:13,410 --> 00:06:14,301
CARAMEL CENTER WHERE ALL THE MONEY IS BEING MADE.

208
00:06:14,344 --> 00:06:17,271
MONEY IS BEING MADE. I KNOW, SAM, THAT THAT’S THE

209
00:06:17,314 --> 00:06:19,072
I KNOW, SAM, THAT THAT’S THE KIND OF ANALOGY YOU AND I CAN

210
00:06:19,082 --> 00:06:21,474
KIND OF ANALOGY YOU AND I CAN RELATE TO BECAUSE I KNOW YOU

211
00:06:21,484 --> 00:06:24,010
RELATE TO BECAUSE I KNOW YOU LIKE THAT GREEN ROOM CANDY I DO.

212
00:06:24,053 --> 00:06:25,044
LIKE THAT GREEN ROOM CANDY I DO. IS THAT RIGHT?

213
00:06:25,088 --> 00:06:26,279
IS THAT RIGHT? SPEAK TO THAT.

214
00:06:26,289 --> 00:06:27,680
SPEAK TO THAT. >> WHEN YOU SHOWED THEIR AD,

215
00:06:27,691 --> 00:06:29,316
>> WHEN YOU SHOWED THEIR AD, THEIR AD WAS CONCERNED WITH ONE

216
00:06:29,326 --> 00:06:30,584
THEIR AD WAS CONCERNED WITH ONE ISSUE, THE ISSUE WAS

217
00:06:30,594 --> 00:06:31,017
ISSUE, THE ISSUE WAS PROTECTIONISM.

218
00:06:31,028 --> 00:06:32,785
PROTECTIONISM. SO WHEN THE PRESIDENT IS IN A

219
00:06:32,796 --> 00:06:34,121
SO WHEN THE PRESIDENT IS IN A TRADE WAR RIGHT NOW, AND HE IS

220
00:06:34,131 --> 00:06:35,422
TRADE WAR RIGHT NOW, AND HE IS IN A TRADE WAR, PARTICULARLY

221
00:06:35,466 --> 00:06:39,126
IN A TRADE WAR, PARTICULARLY WITH CHINA, IF YOU LOOK AT THE

222
00:06:39,136 --> 00:06:41,462
WITH CHINA, IF YOU LOOK AT THE KOCH SUPPLY LINE ON ENERGY, THEY

223
00:06:41,505 --> 00:06:44,731
KOCH SUPPLY LINE ON ENERGY, THEY CAN GET HIT ON BOTH SIDES,

224
00:06:44,742 --> 00:06:46,433
CAN GET HIT ON BOTH SIDES, VIS-A-VIS THE TARIFFS THAT CHINA

225
00:06:46,443 --> 00:06:50,203
VIS-A-VIS THE TARIFFS THAT CHINA PUTS ON AND THE TARIFFS THE

226
00:06:50,213 --> 00:06:53,206
PUTS ON AND THE TARIFFS THE PRESIDENT IS PUTTING ON CHINESE

227
00:06:53,216 --> 00:06:53,540
PRESIDENT IS PUTTING ON CHINESE IMPORTS.

228
00:06:53,550 --> 00:06:54,641
IMPORTS. IT GOES TO BIG MONEY AND

229
00:06:54,651 --> 00:06:55,008
IT GOES TO BIG MONEY AND POLITICS.

230
00:06:55,018 --> 00:06:57,043
POLITICS. WHAT I WOULD SAY IS WHAT HAVE

231
00:06:57,054 --> 00:07:00,714
WHAT I WOULD SAY IS WHAT HAVE THE KOCHS NOT GOTTEN POLICYWISE

232
00:07:00,724 --> 00:07:01,815
THE KOCHS NOT GOTTEN POLICYWISE FROM THIS PRESIDENT THEY COULD

233
00:07:01,825 --> 00:07:02,349
FROM THIS PRESIDENT THEY COULD ARGUE ABOUT?

234
00:07:02,359 --> 00:07:04,151
ARGUE ABOUT? THEY’RE GOING TO PRETEND AS IF

235
00:07:04,194 --> 00:07:05,119
THEY’RE GOING TO PRETEND AS IF THIS IS IDEOLOGICAL.

236
00:07:05,162 --> 00:07:09,056
THIS IS IDEOLOGICAL. THEY’RE BASICALLY ACTING LIKE

237
00:07:09,099 --> 00:07:09,590
THEY’RE BASICALLY ACTING LIKE GLUTTONOUS PIGS.

238
00:07:09,633 --> 00:07:11,425
GLUTTONOUS PIGS. >> HOWARD?

239
00:07:11,435 --> 00:07:13,160
>> HOWARD? >> YOU KNOW, I THINK TRUMP IS

240
00:07:13,203 --> 00:07:13,927
>> YOU KNOW, I THINK TRUMP IS WRONG ABOUT PROTECTIONISM.

241
00:07:13,971 --> 00:07:15,062
WRONG ABOUT PROTECTIONISM. IT’S A MISTAKE.

242
00:07:15,105 --> 00:07:16,730
IT’S A MISTAKE. IT’S GOING TO CATCH UP WITH US,

243
00:07:16,774 --> 00:07:20,167
IT’S GOING TO CATCH UP WITH US, IT’S GOING TO EVENTUALLY UNDO A

244
00:07:20,177 --> 00:07:21,268
IT’S GOING TO EVENTUALLY UNDO A GREAT ECONOMIC EXPANSION WE’VE

245
00:07:21,278 --> 00:07:22,870
GREAT ECONOMIC EXPANSION WE’VE HAD SINCE 2009.

246
00:07:22,913 --> 00:07:24,972
HAD SINCE 2009. SO, YOU KNOW, THE MERITS OF THE

247
00:07:24,982 --> 00:07:27,441
SO, YOU KNOW, THE MERITS OF THE ARGUMENT MAY BE WITH THE KOCHS.

248
00:07:27,484 --> 00:07:30,377
ARGUMENT MAY BE WITH THE KOCHS. THE PROBLEM IS, THE KOCHS HAVE

249
00:07:30,387 --> 00:07:32,145
THE PROBLEM IS, THE KOCHS HAVE NO RESPECT AMONG PEOPLE WHO

250
00:07:32,156 --> 00:07:32,780
NO RESPECT AMONG PEOPLE WHO THINK ABOUT THE FUTURE OF

251
00:07:32,790 --> 00:07:33,681
THINK ABOUT THE FUTURE OF AMERICA AT ALL.

252
00:07:33,724 --> 00:07:35,616
AMERICA AT ALL. THEY’VE TRIED TO BUY THEIR WAY

253
00:07:35,659 --> 00:07:37,484
THEY’VE TRIED TO BUY THEIR WAY IN TO RESPECTABILITY BY KNOW

254
00:07:37,528 --> 00:07:38,685
IN TO RESPECTABILITY BY KNOW NATING HUGE AMOUNTS OF MONEY TO

255
00:07:38,696 --> 00:07:40,121
NATING HUGE AMOUNTS OF MONEY TO VARIOUS CAUSES, SOME OF WHICH

256
00:07:40,164 --> 00:07:40,754
VARIOUS CAUSES, SOME OF WHICH ARE GOOD.

257
00:07:40,765 --> 00:07:42,055
ARE GOOD. I HAPPEN TO LIKE THE

258
00:07:42,066 --> 00:07:44,859
I HAPPEN TO LIKE THE METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART IN

259
00:07:44,869 --> 00:07:45,493
METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART IN NEW YORK.

260
00:07:45,503 --> 00:07:47,661
NEW YORK. THEY GET A TON OF MONEY FROM THE

261
00:07:47,672 --> 00:07:49,497
THEY GET A TON OF MONEY FROM THE KOCH BROTHERS.

262
00:07:49,540 --> 00:07:52,166
KOCH BROTHERS. BEST THING, IGNORE THE KOCH

263
00:07:52,209 --> 00:07:53,701
BEST THING, IGNORE THE KOCH BROTHERS, DON’T PAY ATTENTION TO

264
00:07:53,744 --> 00:07:56,771
BROTHERS, DON’T PAY ATTENTION TO WHAT THEIR MOTIVES ARE, DO PAY

265
00:07:56,814 --> 00:07:57,705
WHAT THEIR MOTIVES ARE, DO PAY ATTENTION TO THE DAMAGE THEY’RE

266
00:07:57,715 --> 00:07:58,906
ATTENTION TO THE DAMAGE THEY’RE DOING TO THE UNITED STATES OF

267
00:07:58,916 --> 00:07:59,206
DOING TO THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.

268
00:07:59,250 --> 00:08:01,642
AMERICA. WE TRULY NEED -- ONE OF THE

269
00:08:01,686 --> 00:08:02,910
WE TRULY NEED -- ONE OF THE REASONS I THINK BRETT KAVANAUGH

270
00:08:02,954 --> 00:08:04,545
REASONS I THINK BRETT KAVANAUGH IS A TERRIBLE IDEA FOR JUSTICE

271
00:08:04,588 --> 00:08:06,613
IS A TERRIBLE IDEA FOR JUSTICE IS WE HAVE GOT TO UNDO CITIZENS

272
00:08:06,624 --> 00:08:06,914
IS WE HAVE GOT TO UNDO CITIZENS UNITED.

273
00:08:06,958 --> 00:08:08,549
UNITED. THE ONLY WAY TO DO THAT IS THE

274
00:08:08,592 --> 00:08:11,318
THE ONLY WAY TO DO THAT IS THE SUPREME COURT.

275
00:08:11,329 --> 00:08:13,287
SUPREME COURT. KAVANAUGH WILL VOTE IN THE WRONG

276
00:08:13,298 --> 00:08:16,290
KAVANAUGH WILL VOTE IN THE WRONG WAY ON THAT ISSUE.

277
00:08:16,300 --> 00:08:18,826
WAY ON THAT ISSUE. >> ARI --

278
00:08:18,836 --> 00:08:19,927
>> ARI -- >> I’M ALMOST OUT OF TIME.

279
00:08:19,970 --> 00:08:21,095
>> I’M ALMOST OUT OF TIME. I WANTED TO GET YOUR REACTION TO

280
00:08:21,138 --> 00:08:23,731
I WANTED TO GET YOUR REACTION TO YOUR FORMER MENTOR ROGER STONE

281
00:08:23,741 --> 00:08:24,932
YOUR FORMER MENTOR ROGER STONE SPEAKING OUT TONIGHT.

282
00:08:24,976 --> 00:08:26,667
SPEAKING OUT TONIGHT. AND ONE OF HIS ASSOCIATES GOING

283
00:08:26,711 --> 00:08:28,302
AND ONE OF HIS ASSOCIATES GOING INTO THE MUELLER GRAND JURY BOX.

284
00:08:28,313 --> 00:08:29,403
INTO THE MUELLER GRAND JURY BOX. DO YOU THINK THAT ROGER’S

285
00:08:29,413 --> 00:08:30,804
DO YOU THINK THAT ROGER’S PLAYING THIS RIGHT?

286
00:08:30,815 --> 00:08:33,641
PLAYING THIS RIGHT? DO YOU THINK HE FACES ANY

287
00:08:33,684 --> 00:08:34,341
DO YOU THINK HE FACES ANY VULNERABILITY AS A POTENTIAL

288
00:08:34,352 --> 00:08:34,742
VULNERABILITY AS A POTENTIAL TARGET HERE?

289
00:08:34,751 --> 00:08:37,944
TARGET HERE? >> WELL, LOOK, AS I’VE SAID,

290
00:08:37,955 --> 00:08:39,413
>> WELL, LOOK, AS I’VE SAID, ROGER IS A CRITICAL PIECE FOR

291
00:08:39,457 --> 00:08:40,948
ROGER IS A CRITICAL PIECE FOR MUELLER’S NARRATIVE.

292
00:08:40,958 --> 00:08:43,150
MUELLER’S NARRATIVE. THIS IS MY VIEW TO SET UP, LET’S

293
00:08:43,193 --> 00:08:45,887
THIS IS MY VIEW TO SET UP, LET’S SAY, THE WATERGATE NARRATIVE

294
00:08:45,930 --> 00:08:48,156
SAY, THE WATERGATE NARRATIVE WHERE YOU HAVE ALL THESE

295
00:08:48,199 --> 00:08:51,526
WHERE YOU HAVE ALL THESE ASSOCIATES MAKING IT LOOK AS IF

296
00:08:51,569 --> 00:08:53,928
ASSOCIATES MAKING IT LOOK AS IF THIS BREAK-IN WAS INVOLVED OR

297
00:08:53,938 --> 00:08:56,364
THIS BREAK-IN WAS INVOLVED OR CONNECTED TO THE PRESIDENT.

298
00:08:56,407 --> 00:08:57,031
CONNECTED TO THE PRESIDENT. THEY’RE GOING INTO ROGER’S

299
00:08:57,075 --> 00:08:57,665
THEY’RE GOING INTO ROGER’S PERSONAL FINANCES.

300
00:08:57,676 --> 00:09:00,067
PERSONAL FINANCES. SO WHEN I THINK WHEN ROGER IS

301
00:09:00,078 --> 00:09:02,670
SO WHEN I THINK WHEN ROGER IS INDICTED, UNFORTUNATELY I DON’T

302
00:09:02,681 --> 00:09:03,471
INDICTED, UNFORTUNATELY I DON’T SUPPORT IT, YOU’LL HAVE SOME --

303
00:09:03,514 --> 00:09:04,639
SUPPORT IT, YOU’LL HAVE SOME -- >> YOU EXPECT HIM TO BE

304
00:09:04,682 --> 00:09:05,039
>> YOU EXPECT HIM TO BE INDICTED.

305
00:09:05,049 --> 00:09:06,774
INDICTED. >> YES, I DO, AND YOU’RE GOING

306
00:09:06,785 --> 00:09:07,876
>> YES, I DO, AND YOU’RE GOING TO HAVE SOME BROAD CHARGE THAT

307
00:09:07,919 --> 00:09:09,244
TO HAVE SOME BROAD CHARGE THAT HE WAS PART OF A CONSPIRACY TO

308
00:09:09,287 --> 00:09:10,545
HE WAS PART OF A CONSPIRACY TO DEFRAUD AMERICA, THEN BACKED UP

309
00:09:10,555 --> 00:09:13,982
DEFRAUD AMERICA, THEN BACKED UP WITH A BUNCH OF FINANCIAL

310
00:09:14,025 --> 00:09:14,316
WITH A BUNCH OF FINANCIAL CHARGES.

311
00:09:14,359 --> 00:09:15,550
CHARGES. AND THIS WOULD NOT HAVE HAPPENED

312
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:17,786
AND THIS WOULD NOT HAVE HAPPENED BUT FOR THIS SPECIAL COUNSEL.

313
00:09:17,796 --> 00:09:20,855
BUT FOR THIS SPECIAL COUNSEL. I -- LET’S SEE WHAT HAPPENS.

314
00:09:20,866 --> 00:09:21,756
I -- LET’S SEE WHAT HAPPENS. WITH THAT SAID, I HOPE THAT

315
00:09:21,766 --> 00:09:23,791
WITH THAT SAID, I HOPE THAT ANDREW MILLER CONTINUES TO FIGHT

316
00:09:23,802 --> 00:09:24,859
ANDREW MILLER CONTINUES TO FIGHT THE DECISION HE GOT ALL THE WAY

317
00:09:24,870 --> 00:09:25,893
THE DECISION HE GOT ALL THE WAY UP TO THE SUPREME COURT BECAUSE

318
00:09:25,904 --> 00:00:00,000
UP TO THE SUPREME COURT BECAUSE IT’S A VERY IMPORTANT DECISION
