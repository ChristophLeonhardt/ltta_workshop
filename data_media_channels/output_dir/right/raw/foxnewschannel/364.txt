A PART OF SENATOR’S COLLINS

SPEECH ON THE SENATE FLOOR.

11
00:00:30,939 --> 00:00:34,442
>> I DO NOT BELIEVE THAT THESE

12
00:00:34,443 --> 00:00:40,582
CHARGES CAN FAIRLY PREVENT JUDGE

13
00:00:40,583 --> 00:00:42,116
KAVANAUGH WHEN SERVING ON THE

14
00:00:42,117 --> 00:00:42,417
COURT.

15
00:00:42,418 --> 00:00:44,819
TO THAT LEAKER WHO I HOPE IS

16
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:48,289
LISTENING NOW, LET ME SAY THAT

17
00:00:48,290 --> 00:00:53,461
WHAT YOU DID WAS UNCONSCIONABLE.

18
00:00:53,462 --> 00:00:55,597
SO PUBLIC CONFIDENCE IN OUR

19
00:00:55,598 --> 00:00:59,868
JUDICIARY AND OUR HIGHEST COURT

20
00:00:59,869 --> 00:01:02,437

00:01:02,438 --> 00:01:06,675
MR. PRESIDENT, I WILL VOTE TO

McCONNELL’S BIG WIN.

26
00:01:17,086 --> 00:01:19,087
THE WHITE HOUSE RESPONDED WITH

27
00:01:19,088 --> 00:01:20,656
THIS TWEET FROM SARAH SANDERS.

28
00:01:20,657 --> 00:01:22,124
THANK YOU, SENATOR COLLINS FOR

29
00:01:22,125 --> 00:01:23,358
STANDING BY YOUR CONVICTIONS AND

30
00:01:23,359 --> 00:01:30,032
DOING THE RIGHT THING TO CONFIRM
STANDING BY YOUR CONVICTIONS AND

31
00:01:30,033 --> 00:01:30,033
DOING THE RIGHT THING TO CONFIRM

32
00:01:30,033 --> 00:01:31,333
JUDGE KAVANAUGH.

33
00:01:31,334 --> 00:01:34,903
I THINK WE ALL WATCHED COLLINS

34
00:01:34,904 --> 00:01:35,237
SPEECH.

35
00:01:35,238 --> 00:01:36,305
IT WAS AN IMPORTANT SPEECH.

36
00:01:36,306 --> 00:01:37,906
I WONDER WHAT YOU THOUGHT OF IT.

37
00:01:37,907 --> 00:01:42,745
>> STARTED TALKING AND I

38
00:01:42,746 --> 00:01:43,412
STARTED YAWNING.

39
00:01:43,413 --> 00:01:44,847
I REALIZED I AM MISSING

40
00:01:44,848 --> 00:01:46,115
SOMETHING HUGE.

41
00:01:46,116 --> 00:01:47,950
I AM NOT TRAINED TO HEAR IT.

42
00:01:47,951 --> 00:01:51,087
WE SPENT SO MUCH TIME WITH

43
00:01:51,088 --> 00:01:52,221
SHORT, LOUD TRUMPIAN SPEECHES.

44
00:01:52,222 --> 00:01:53,656
THIS MIGHT BE THE MOST IMPORTANT

45
00:01:53,657 --> 00:01:56,058
SPEECH I HAVE HEARD IN YEARS.

46
00:01:56,059 --> 00:01:58,928
SHE WAS NOT JUST DEFENDING

47
00:01:58,929 --> 00:01:59,295
KAVANAUGH.

48
00:01:59,296 --> 00:02:00,663
SHE WAS DEFENDING HOURLY SYSTEM

49
00:02:00,664 --> 00:02:06,169
AND TRYING TO PRESERVE THE

50
00:02:06,170 --> 00:02:06,569
INSTITUTION.

51
00:02:06,570 --> 00:02:08,304
SHE WAS LIKE PREVIOUSLY IN THE

52
00:02:08,305 --> 00:02:08,704
GOVERNMENT.

53
00:02:08,705 --> 00:02:11,140
SHE WENT FROM THE BEGINNING TO

54
00:02:11,141 --> 00:02:12,709
THE PRESENT TIME AND TOOK US

55
00:02:12,710 --> 00:02:15,845
THROUGH THE RESISTANCE AND HIS

56
00:02:15,846 --> 00:02:16,446
LEGAL BACKGROUND.

57
00:02:16,447 --> 00:02:18,114
SHE WAS A HAMMER OF REASON GOING

58
00:02:18,115 --> 00:02:19,549
THROUGH ALL OF THIS STUFF.

59
00:02:19,550 --> 00:02:21,818
SHE BROUGHT US FROM THE START TO

60
00:02:21,819 --> 00:02:23,653
THE FINISH PROVIDING COVER FOR

61
00:02:23,654 --> 00:02:24,354
EVERYBODY ELSE.

62
00:02:24,355 --> 00:02:25,788
SHE SPOKE NOT FOR KAVANAUGH.

63
00:02:25,789 --> 00:02:28,358
SHE WAS SPEAKING FOR US.

64
00:02:28,359 --> 00:02:31,027
I GO TO TWITTER BECAUSE I SEE

65
00:02:31,028 --> 00:02:33,763
OTHER MEDIA MAKING JOKES ABOUT

66
00:02:33,764 --> 00:02:34,030
HER.

67
00:02:34,031 --> 00:02:37,867
MALE REPORTERS MOCKING HER

68
00:02:37,868 --> 00:02:40,704
BECAUSE SHE IS SLOW OR BORING.

69
00:02:40,705 --> 00:02:42,439
BUT THEY ARE DUMBER THAN ME FOR

70
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:43,006
DOING THAT.

71
00:02:43,007 --> 00:02:46,243
THEY ARE MAKING FUN OF A WOMAN.

72
00:02:46,244 --> 00:02:46,843
A BRAVE WOMAN.

73
00:02:46,844 --> 00:02:49,446
SHE’LL BE HARASSED FOR THE REST

74
00:02:49,447 --> 00:02:50,180
OF HER LIFE.

75
00:02:50,181 --> 00:02:53,517
>> SHE DECIDED TO DO IT ON

76
00:02:53,518 --> 00:02:55,152
MERITS.

77
00:02:55,153 --> 00:02:59,189
THIS WAS NOT A PARTISAN DECISION

78
00:02:59,190 --> 00:02:59,623
FOR HER.

79
00:02:59,624 --> 00:03:01,892
>> IT SHOULD NOT BE THIS CLOSE.

80
00:03:01,893 --> 00:03:04,928
THE MEDIA HAS BEEN COMPLICIT IN

81
00:03:04,929 --> 00:03:07,898
SPREADING THE DISINFORMATION.

82
00:03:07,899 --> 00:03:09,733
THE MEDIA IGNORED AND THE

83
00:03:09,734 --> 00:03:11,568
THE LETTER FROM FORD’S BOYFRIEND

84
00:03:11,569 --> 00:03:17,608
THAT RAISED CREDIBILITY ISSUES,

85
00:03:17,609 --> 00:03:18,676
BOYFRIEND OF JULIE SWETNICK

86
00:03:18,677 --> 00:03:20,311
RAISED QUESTIONS ABOUT HER

87
00:03:20,312 --> 00:03:22,413
CREDIBILITY AND PARTICIPATING IN

88
00:03:22,414 --> 00:03:24,281
UNSAFFORY THINGS THAT I CAN’T

89
00:03:24,282 --> 00:03:25,683
SAY ON TELEVISION.

90
00:03:25,684 --> 00:03:29,954
HER HISTORY OF FRIVOLOUS

91
00:03:29,955 --> 00:03:30,321
LAWSUITS.

92
00:03:30,322 --> 00:03:35,059
AND THEY BURIED THE MITCHELL

93
00:03:35,060 --> 00:03:35,393
REPORT.

94
00:03:35,394 --> 00:03:37,595
THE MEDIA BURIED THAT.

95
00:03:37,596 --> 00:03:38,796
THEY NEVER TALKED ABOUT ALL OF

96
00:03:38,797 --> 00:03:41,332
THE WITNESSES ALLEGED THAT COULD

97
00:03:41,333 --> 00:03:43,668
NOT CORROBORATE THIS STORY FROM
THE WITNESSES ALLEGED THAT COULD

98
00:03:43,669 --> 00:03:43,669
NOT CORROBORATE THIS STORY FROM

99
00:03:43,669 --> 00:03:43,968
FORD.

100
00:03:43,969 --> 00:03:46,704
THERE WAS AN INTERESTING POLLING

101
00:03:46,705 --> 00:03:47,872
QUESTION.

102
00:03:47,873 --> 00:03:55,113
IT WAS UNDER 50% PUBLIC SUPPORT

103
00:03:55,114 --> 00:03:56,948
FOR THE KAVANAUGH CONFIRMATION.

104
00:03:56,949 --> 00:03:59,450
YOU WERE TOLD THAT THE ALLEGED

105
00:03:59,451 --> 00:04:01,619
WITNESSES COULD NOT CORROBORATE

106
00:04:01,620 --> 00:04:03,221
FORD IT SKY ROCKETS TO 60%.

107
00:04:03,222 --> 00:04:06,491
STILL THINGS ARE LEAKING.

108
00:04:06,492 --> 00:04:14,699
THE FRIEND OF FORD ALLEGEDLY

109
00:04:14,700 --> 00:04:15,567
TRIED TO GET THEM TO CHANGE

110
00:04:15,568 --> 00:04:17,068
THEIR STORY.

111
00:04:17,069 --> 00:04:19,237
A FORMER FBI AGENT.

112
00:04:19,238 --> 00:04:20,772
SHE WAS COACHED BY FORD ON HOW

113
00:04:20,773 --> 00:04:22,641
TO TAKE A POLYGRAH TEST.

114
00:04:22,642 --> 00:04:25,310
THIS WOMAN IS REPRESENTED BY A

115
00:04:25,311 --> 00:04:27,813
LAWYER WHO LEFT THE JUSTICE

116
00:04:27,814 --> 00:04:29,014
DEPARTMENT IN A HUFF OVER

117
00:04:29,015 --> 00:04:31,083
TRUMP’S ELECTION AND OVERSAW THE

118
00:04:31,084 --> 00:04:32,217
HILLARY CLINTON PROBE.

119
00:04:32,218 --> 00:04:33,919
VERY SKETCHY STUFF.

120
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:38,590
GRASSLEY IS ALLUDING TO MORE

121
00:04:38,591 --> 00:04:41,026
COORDINATION BETWEEN FORD’S TEAM

122
00:04:41,027 --> 00:04:44,797
AND DIANNE FEINSTEIN.

123
00:04:44,798 --> 00:04:47,332
SUSAN COLLINS MENTIONED THESE

124
00:04:47,333 --> 00:04:47,666
THINGS.

125
00:04:47,667 --> 00:04:49,301
THESE ANTICS.

126
00:04:49,302 --> 00:04:53,172
THE AVANATI ACCUSATIONS DIDN’T

127
00:04:53,173 --> 00:04:53,705
HELP.

128
00:04:53,706 --> 00:04:54,573
EVERYTHING THAT THESE PEOPLE DO

129
00:04:54,574 --> 00:04:57,409
IN THE HALLWAYS IS NOT HELPING.

130
00:04:57,410 --> 00:04:58,711
YOU HAVE TO LOOK BACK AT THIS

131
00:04:58,712 --> 00:05:00,813
THING AND SAY THE DEMOCRATS

132
00:05:00,814 --> 00:05:01,747
OVER-PLAYED THEIR HAND HERE.

133
00:05:01,748 --> 00:05:05,251
>> DID YOU THINK GIVEN ALL OF

134
00:05:05,252 --> 00:05:08,053
YOUR EXPERIENCE --

135
00:05:08,054 --> 00:05:09,855
>> I CAN’T BELIEVE I SAT HERE

136
00:05:09,856 --> 00:05:12,958
AND LISTENED TO THAT WITHOUT

137
00:05:12,959 --> 00:05:14,894
ERUPTING IN RAGE OR BEGAN TO

138
00:05:14,895 --> 00:05:16,295
SHOW MY EXPLOSIVE PASSIONS.

139
00:05:16,296 --> 00:05:17,296
I AM NOT JUDGE KAVANAUGH.

140
00:05:17,297 --> 00:05:20,333
I DON’T GET A CHANCE TO CRY.

141
00:05:20,334 --> 00:05:21,834
>> ONLY WOMEN CRY?

142
00:05:21,835 --> 00:05:24,237
THAT’S VERY SEXIST TO MAKE FUN

143
00:05:24,238 --> 00:05:25,538
OF A MAN FOR CRYING.

144
00:05:25,539 --> 00:05:26,973
>> I NEVER MADE FUN OF ANYBODY

145
00:05:26,974 --> 00:05:27,306
CRYING.

146
00:05:27,307 --> 00:05:30,643
I HAVE SEEN A LOT OF MEN CRY IN

147
00:05:30,644 --> 00:05:31,010
MY LIFE.

148
00:05:31,011 --> 00:05:34,247
>> I DID THAT ONCE AFTER ONE

149
00:05:34,248 --> 00:05:34,547
SHOW.

150
00:05:34,548 --> 00:05:35,081
>> [LAUGHING].

151
00:05:35,082 --> 00:05:36,816
>> IF I HAD A TISSUE I WOULD

152
00:05:36,817 --> 00:05:38,484
GIVE IT TO YOU NOW.

153
00:05:38,485 --> 00:05:41,921
I COULD SING AND YOU WOULD CRY.

154
00:05:41,922 --> 00:05:44,490
>> UP UNTIL SUSAN COLLINS GAVE

155
00:05:44,491 --> 00:05:45,658
HER SPEECH DID YOU THINK THERE

156
00:05:45,659 --> 00:05:48,094
WAS A CHANCE THAT THE

157
00:05:48,095 --> 00:05:50,196
REPUBLICANS MIGHT NOT GET THIS

158
00:05:50,197 --> 00:05:50,797
CONFIRMATION DONE?

159
00:05:50,798 --> 00:05:53,166
>> WHEN IT COMES TO SENATE

160
00:05:53,167 --> 00:05:55,869
NOMINATIONS FOR JUDICIAL

161
00:05:55,870 --> 00:05:57,003
POSITIONS, THE REPUBLICANS HAVE

162
00:05:57,004 --> 00:05:57,837
ONLY ONE SPEED:

163
00:05:57,838 --> 00:05:59,806
GO AHEAD AND GET IT DONE.

164
00:05:59,807 --> 00:06:01,675
WE SAW WITH GARLAND.

165
00:06:01,676 --> 00:06:04,244
HE DIDN’T GET A HEARING.

166
00:06:04,245 --> 00:06:05,946
WE SAW WITH JUSTICE GORSUCH, HE

167
00:06:05,947 --> 00:06:07,747
GOT A HEARING.

168
00:06:07,748 --> 00:06:09,916
THEY GOT IT DONE.

169
00:06:09,917 --> 00:06:11,184
THREE DEMOCRATS WALKED ACROSS

170
00:06:11,185 --> 00:06:12,919
THE AISLE TO SUPPORT HIM.

171
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:15,455
LOOK, I AM NOT GOING TO SIT HERE

172
00:06:15,456 --> 00:06:17,190
AND BELITTLE THE WOMEN WHO HAVE
LOOK, I AM NOT GOING TO SIT HERE

173
00:06:17,191 --> 00:06:17,191
AND BELITTLE THE WOMEN WHO HAVE

174
00:06:17,191 --> 00:06:18,025
COME FORWARD.

175
00:06:18,026 --> 00:06:21,562
I WON’T TRY TO BRING BACK OLD

176
00:06:21,563 --> 00:06:22,796
CONVERSATION BUSY THEIR PAST

177
00:06:22,797 --> 00:06:24,498
BECAUSE THEY ARE NOT APPLYING

178
00:06:24,499 --> 00:06:28,569
FOR A LIFETIME POSITION ON THE

179
00:06:28,570 --> 00:06:29,436
CEREMENT.

180
00:06:29,437 --> 00:06:30,671
-- SUPREME COURT.

181
00:06:30,672 --> 00:06:32,439
JUDGE KAVANAUGH SHOULD HAVE

182
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:33,474
EXPECTED THAT HIS LIFE HISTORY

183
00:06:33,475 --> 00:06:34,541
WOULD COME UP.

184
00:06:34,542 --> 00:06:36,176
WE EXPECT THAT WITH A CANDIDATE

185
00:06:36,177 --> 00:06:38,379
FOR PRESIDENT -- SORRY, I

186
00:06:38,380 --> 00:06:38,979
TOUCHED YOU.

187
00:06:38,980 --> 00:06:40,948
>> I LIKE BEING TOUCHED.

188
00:06:40,949 --> 00:06:43,017
I AM FROM AN ITALIAN FAMILY AND

189
00:06:43,018 --> 00:06:44,785
WE ARE ALWAYS TOUCHING EACH

190

YOU CAN’T ANTICIPATE THAT YOU

195
00:06:57,032 --> 00:06:59,634

THE MANNER OF NOT JUST HEARINGS
YOUR ENTIRE PAST WILL COME UP IN

THE MANNER OF NOT JUST HEARINGS

200
00:07:07,843 --> 00:07:09,911
BUT A MANNER OF INVESTIGATIONS.

201
00:07:09,912 --> 00:07:12,280

IT APPEARS THEY HAVE THE VOTES.

206
00:07:16,752 --> 00:07:17,785
WE DON’T KNOW.

207
00:07:17,786 --> 00:07:19,754
PEOPLE WHO ARE STILL UPSET.

208
00:07:19,755 --> 00:07:23,057
PEOPLE STILL WANT TO WEIGH IN.

THE MOST POWERFUL SENATOR IS

227
00:08:05,134 --> 00:08:06,535
SENATOR JOE MANCHIN.

228
00:08:06,536 --> 00:08:07,970
HE IS NOT JUST SOMEBODY THAT

229
00:08:07,971 --> 00:08:11,206
SAYS I AM PRO GUN AND

230
00:08:11,207 --> 00:08:11,673
ANTI-OBAMACARE.

231
00:08:11,674 --> 00:08:13,208
THIS IS THE FIRST TIME HE HAS

232
00:08:13,209 --> 00:08:18,781
HAD A MAJOR VOTE AS A SO-CALLED

233
00:08:18,782 --> 00:08:21,784
MODERATE DEMOCRAT.

GO ACROSS THE AISLE AND VOTE.

240
00:08:33,964 --> 00:08:36,265
I WOULD SAY THIS ABOUT THIS

241
00:08:36,265 --> 00:08:37,198
WHOLE THING.

242
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:38,701
>> WE HAVE A CHANCE TO TALK

243
00:08:38,702 --> 00:08:40,403
ABOUT JOE MANCHIN IN A MOMENT.

HOLD THAT THOUGHT.

245
00:08:41,538 --> 00:08:44,240
WE’LL WILL GET TO JOHN ROBERTS.

00:08:44,241 --> 00:08:45,408
HE HAS BREAKING NEWS ABOUT HIM.

247
00:08:45,409 --> 00:08:48,544

248
00:08:48,545 --> 00:08:52,915
COMPREHENSIVE SPEECHES IN QUITE

249
00:08:52,916 --> 00:08:53,282
SOMETIME.

250
00:08:53,283 --> 00:08:56,052
THERE WERE NO BAD GUYS.

251
00:08:56,053 --> 00:08:59,455
THE ONLY BAD GUY WAS THE

252
00:08:59,456 --> 00:09:00,890
LEASHING.

253
00:09:00,891 --> 00:09:04,127
-- LEAKER.

254
00:09:04,128 --> 00:09:05,862
FEINSTEIN I KNOW YOU WOULD NOT

255
00:09:05,863 --> 00:09:07,263
DO THAT.

256
00:09:07,264 --> 00:09:09,399
SHE IS TRYING TO RE-START.

257
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:11,100
SHE IS TRYING TO START FRESH.

258
00:09:11,101 --> 00:09:15,105
LET’S SAY THE NEXT THING IS

259
00:09:15,106 --> 00:09:15,438
OPIOIDS.

260
00:09:15,439 --> 00:09:16,806
SOMETHING WE CAN DO TOGETHER.

261
00:09:16,807 --> 00:09:19,576
I THINK WE ARE STARING AT THE

262
00:09:19,577 --> 00:09:21,177
CLIFF AND NOBODY WANTS TO JUMP.

263
00:09:21,178 --> 00:09:22,212
NOT REPUBLICANS OR DEMOCRATS.

264
00:09:22,213 --> 00:09:24,781
I THINK THE NEXT TIME YOU HAVE

265
00:09:24,782 --> 00:09:27,150
ME BACK HERE IN 2021, WE WILL

266
00:09:27,151 --> 00:09:28,185
HAVE A SITUATION WHERE PEOPLE

267
00:09:28,186 --> 00:09:29,953
ARE MAKING DEALS AGAIN.

268
00:09:29,954 --> 00:09:31,321
>> SPEAK OF JOE MANCHIN THE

269
00:09:31,322 --> 00:09:32,422
SENATOR FROM WEST VIRGINIA.

270
00:09:32,423 --> 00:09:33,857
JOHN ROBERTS IS AT THE WHITE

271
00:09:33,858 --> 00:09:35,792
HOUSE.

272
00:09:35,793 --> 00:09:38,995
I THINK YOU HAVE SOME TIDBIT

273
00:09:38,996 --> 00:09:40,597
ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED TODAY?

274
00:09:40,598 --> 00:09:41,531
>> I DO.

275
00:09:41,532 --> 00:09:43,667
FIRST TO BRIAN’S POINT, YOU

276
00:09:43,668 --> 00:09:46,670
COULD LAY A SAFE BET THAT

277
00:09:46,671 --> 00:09:48,939
PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS BEEN

278
00:09:48,940 --> 00:09:50,140
CAMPAIGNING HEAVILY IN WEST

279
00:09:50,141 --> 00:09:53,444
VIRGINIA AND MAY NOT MAKE ANY

280
00:09:53,445 --> 00:09:56,480
MORE CAMPAIGN APPEARANCES THERE.

281
00:09:56,481 --> 00:09:59,183
JOE MANCHIN WAS A BIG PART OF

282
00:09:59,184 --> 00:09:59,750
THIS.

283
00:09:59,751 --> 00:10:02,286
I TALKED TO THE WHITE HOUSE

284
00:10:02,287 --> 00:10:02,653
OFFICIALS.

285
00:10:02,654 --> 00:10:04,021
AFTER THE CLOTURE VOTE.

286
00:10:04,022 --> 00:10:05,856
DO YOU THINK YOU CAN HOLD TO ON

287
00:10:05,857 --> 00:10:06,190
MANCHIN?

288
00:10:06,191 --> 00:10:06,857
THEY SAID YES.

289
00:10:06,858 --> 00:10:09,426
THAT THIS MORNING SENATOR JOE

290
00:10:09,427 --> 00:10:10,494
THE REASON FOR THAT OPTIMISM WAS

291
00:10:10,495 --> 00:10:11,395
MANCHIN CALLED THE WHITE HOUSE

292
00:10:11,396 --> 00:10:14,064
A YES ON THE CONFIRMATION FOR

293
00:10:14,065 --> 00:10:17,968
AND SAID THAT HE WAS GOING TO BE

294
00:10:17,969 --> 00:10:18,536
BRETT KAVANAUGH.

295
00:10:18,537 --> 00:10:19,937
PEOPLE AROUND HERE WERE HAPPY

296
00:10:19,938 --> 00:10:22,640
TODAY THINKING THIS WOULD GO

297
00:10:22,641 --> 00:10:23,574
THROUGH.

298
00:10:23,575 --> 00:10:27,311
THE ONE WILD CARD WAS SUSAN

299
00:10:27,312 --> 00:10:27,778
COLLINS.

300
00:10:27,779 --> 00:10:28,813
SHE DIDN’T CALL THE WHITE HOUSE

301
00:10:28,814 --> 00:10:31,883
TO SAY SHE WOULD BE A YES.

302
00:10:31,884 --> 00:10:32,750
WHITE HOUSE OFFICIALS ASSUMED IF

303
00:10:32,751 --> 00:10:34,719
SHE WAS GOING TO BE A NO, THAT

304
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:36,320
SHE WOULD HAVE CALLED TO INFORM

305
00:10:36,321 --> 00:10:37,722
THEM OF THAT.

306
00:10:37,723 --> 00:10:40,425

US.

310
00:10:42,962 --> 00:10:47,265
THEY WERE HANGING ON EVERY WORD

311
00:10:47,266 --> 00:10:49,667
SHE SAID.

312
00:10:49,668 --> 00:10:53,104

IF SOMETHING WERE TO HAPPEN, HE

322
00:11:08,154 --> 00:11:09,154
COULD COME BACK.

323
00:11:09,155 --> 00:11:11,890
IT’S A SAFE BET TO SAY THE

324
00:11:11,891 --> 00:11:14,626
VICE-PRESIDENT WILL PROBABLY BE

325
00:11:14,627 --> 00:11:16,461
AROUND TOWN JUST IN CASE.

326
00:11:16,462 --> 00:11:18,263

327
00:11:18,264 --> 00:11:18,764
>> A COMMENT.

328
00:11:18,765 --> 00:11:19,865

>> IT BETTER BE.

331
00:11:25,805 --> 00:11:28,640
>> IF I WERE JOE MANCHIN I WOULD

332
00:11:28,641 --> 00:11:30,008
HAVE HELD OUT FOR MORE.

333
00:11:30,009 --> 00:11:32,878
REMEMBER OBAMACARE AND HOW THEY

334
00:11:32,879 --> 00:11:34,146
GOT THROUGH.

335
00:11:34,147 --> 00:11:37,583
THE CORN HUSKER KICKBACK?

336
00:11:37,584 --> 00:11:41,420
WHAT DID HE GET THROUGH.

337
00:11:41,421 --> 00:11:46,025
OBAMA GOT THAT THROUGH WITH

338
00:11:46,026 --> 00:11:47,726
BRIBES AND LIES.

339
00:11:47,727 --> 00:11:48,394
THIS WAS MAYBE LUNCH?

340
00:11:48,395 --> 00:11:50,162
>> WE COULD HAVE GOTTEN MORE.

341
00:11:50,163 --> 00:11:51,964
>> I THINK HE DID ACTUALLY

342
00:11:51,965 --> 00:11:54,033
DEMAND A PIECE OF WEDDING CAKE

343
00:11:54,034 --> 00:11:55,267
FROM SENATOR DAINES WHEN HE

344
00:11:55,268 --> 00:11:56,669
COMES BACK FROM MONTANA.

345
00:11:56,670 --> 00:11:57,903
THIS WOULD HAPPEN.

346
00:11:57,904 --> 00:12:00,840
THIS IS NOT TO SAY ANYTHING LIKE

347
00:12:00,841 --> 00:12:03,342
YOU WILL REMEMBER 2 YEARS AGO

348
00:12:03,343 --> 00:12:08,881

A LOT OF PEOPLE SAID THEY WOULD

00:12:13,420 --> 00:12:16,189
NOT BE SURPRISED TO SEE JOE

00:12:21,428 --> 00:12:24,397
2024.

PRIORITIES USA HAVE ANNOUNCED

THE U.S. SENATE RACE.

369
00:12:55,963 --> 00:12:57,431
I WOULD ADVISE THEM TO CONTINUE

>> I TRIED TO FIND A JOKE THAT

377
00:13:11,613 --> 00:13:13,547
WOULD MAKE A 4-YEAR-OLD LAUGH.

378
00:13:13,548 --> 00:13:15,415
I THINK I EVEN FAILED.

379
00:13:15,416 --> 00:13:18,852
THE THING THAT DRIVES ME NUTS.

380
00:13:18,853 --> 00:13:22,256
WITNESS TAMPERING, IT’S ANOTHER

381
00:13:22,257 --> 00:13:23,123
BLACKOUT.

382
00:13:23,124 --> 00:13:25,025
THAT’S A BIG PIECE OF THIS.

383
00:13:25,026 --> 00:13:26,560
>> YOU BROUGHT IT UP YESTERDAY.

384
00:13:26,561 --> 00:13:29,096
>> THEY ARE MORE OBSESSED WITH

385
00:13:29,097 --> 00:13:31,231
ICE CUBANS.

386
00:13:31,232 --> 00:13:32,233
-- CUBES.

387
00:13:32,234 --> 00:13:35,202
CHASING MELTING ICE AND NOT

388
00:13:35,203 --> 00:13:35,503
THIS.

389
00:13:35,504 --> 00:13:37,171
I AM INTERESTED IN GRASSLEY’S

390
00:13:37,172 --> 00:13:43,377
LETTER DEMANDING THE

391
00:13:43,378 --> 00:13:46,314
CORRESPONDENCE WITH KATZ.

00:13:48,016 --> 00:13:49,450
IT WEIRD HOW EVERYBODY IS SILENT
AND THE BAR ASSOCIATION, I FIND

00:13:49,451 --> 00:13:49,451
IT WEIRD HOW EVERYBODY IS SILENT

395
00:13:49,451 --> 00:13:50,418
NOW ABOUT AVANATI.

396
00:13:50,419 --> 00:13:53,588
I THINK THAT EVEN THE DEMOCRATS

397
00:13:53,589 --> 00:13:58,192
ARE REALIZING HE PLAYED A GREAT
I THINK THAT EVEN THE DEMOCRATS

398
00:13:58,193 --> 00:13:58,193
ARE REALIZING HE PLAYED A GREAT

399
00:13:58,193 --> 00:14:00,261
ROLE IN DESTROYING THE

400
00:14:00,262 --> 00:14:02,397
DEMOCRATIC PARTY.

401
00:14:02,398 --> 00:14:04,932
IF HE NEVER ENTERED THE PICTURE

402
00:14:04,933 --> 00:14:07,835
YOU WOULD JUST HAVE FORD AND NOT
IF HE NEVER ENTERED THE PICTURE

403
00:14:07,836 --> 00:14:07,836
YOU WOULD JUST HAVE FORD AND NOT

404
00:14:07,836 --> 00:14:09,637
THIS CRAZY GANG RAPE STORY.

405
00:14:09,638 --> 00:14:12,740
I THINK AVANATI IS A REPUBLICAN

406
00:14:12,741 --> 00:14:13,041
PLANT.

407
00:14:13,042 --> 00:14:15,610
>> I THINK YOU ARE 100% RIGHT.

408
00:14:15,611 --> 00:14:17,112
THE STORY WAS DEMOCRATS WERE

409
00:14:17,113 --> 00:14:19,147
SAYING WHAT IS HE DOING?

410
00:14:19,148 --> 00:14:28,256
>> GUYS, THIS IS NOT OVER.

411
00:14:28,257 --> 00:14:30,992
>> [LAUGHING].

412
00:14:30,993 --> 00:14:34,062
>> [OVERLAPPING TALKING].

413
00:14:34,063 --> 00:14:36,932
>> WHAT DOES THIS MEAN FOR THE

414
00:14:36,933 --> 00:14:37,466
MID-TERMS?

415
00:14:37,467 --> 00:14:39,935
PEOPLE ON THE DEMOCRATIC SIDE --

416
00:14:39,936 --> 00:14:41,136
THE REPUBLICAN SIDE THEY WERE

417
00:14:41,137 --> 00:14:44,873
MOTIVATED WHEN IT LOOKED LIKE HE

418
00:14:44,874 --> 00:14:45,974
WOULD NOT GET THROUGH.

419
00:14:45,975 --> 00:14:47,876
ARE THEY STILL MOTIVATED?

420
00:14:47,877 --> 00:14:50,012
>> ARE LOSERS MORE MOTIVATED

421
00:14:50,013 --> 00:14:51,513
BECAUSE THEY ARE ANGRY?

422
00:14:51,514 --> 00:14:55,984
>> 32 DAYS FROM NOW -- FIRST,

423
00:14:55,985 --> 00:14:58,253
MANY STATES ARE VOTING.

424
00:14:58,254 --> 00:14:59,922

PEOPLE ARE TURNING IN THEIR

BALLOTS.

429
00:15:09,766 --> 00:15:12,501
THIS WILL IMPACT THE MID-TERMS.

430
00:15:12,502 --> 00:15:16,272
PEOPLE WILL BE GALVANIZED ON THE

431
00:15:16,273 --> 00:15:18,340
LEFT AND THE RIGHT.

432
00:15:18,341 --> 00:15:20,209
THEY WILL DECIDE THIS ISSUE IS

433

THE THAT GALVANIZED THEM TO

00:15:25,148 --> 00:15:25,448
VOTE.

435
00:15:25,449 --> 00:15:27,983
>> CHUCK SCHUMER THIS MORNING.

436
00:15:27,984 --> 00:15:30,119
TALKING ABOUT THE KAVANAUGH

437
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:30,920
HEARINGS COMPARED TO THE

438
00:15:30,921 --> 00:15:31,687
CLARENCE THOMAS HEARINGS.

439
00:15:31,688 --> 00:15:34,957
COULD WE PLAY THAT?

440
00:15:34,958 --> 00:15:36,526
>> THE DAM BROKE UNDER THE

441
00:15:36,527 --> 00:15:39,095
WEIGHT OF CREDIBILITY

442
00:15:39,096 --> 00:15:41,230
ALLEGATIONS THAT JUDGE KAVANAUGH

443
00:15:41,231 --> 00:15:43,900
COMMITTED A SEXUAL ASSAULT IN

444
00:15:43,901 --> 00:15:46,002
HIGH SCHOOL.

445
00:15:46,003 --> 00:15:48,738
IN 2018, THE REPUBLICAN MAJORITY

446
00:15:48,739 --> 00:15:51,741
CONDUCTED A HEARING THAT MADE

447
00:15:51,742 --> 00:15:54,777
THE ANITA HILL HEARINGS IN 1991

448
00:15:54,778 --> 00:15:57,013
LOOK FAIR BY COMPARISON.

449
00:15:57,014 --> 00:16:00,450
>> WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THAT,

450
00:16:00,451 --> 00:16:00,750
JESSE?

451
00:16:00,751 --> 00:16:03,386
>> WELL, LISTEN IT’S A HUGE

452
00:16:03,387 --> 00:16:05,388
DIFFERENCE IN THAT STORY.

453
00:16:05,389 --> 00:16:09,759
THE BOTTOM LINE, CHUCK LOST AND

454
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:10,360
MITCH MCCONNELL WON.

455
00:16:10,361 --> 00:16:12,295
IT WAS A HUGE VICTORY FOR MITCH

456
00:16:12,296 --> 00:16:12,762
McCONNELL.

457
00:16:12,763 --> 00:16:16,066
JUST AS BIG FOR GRASSLEY AND FOR

458
00:16:16,067 --> 00:16:16,499
DONALD TRUMP.

459
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:17,467
THINK ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED HERE.

460
00:16:17,468 --> 00:16:19,069
YOU HAVE A WINDOW.

461
00:16:19,070 --> 00:16:20,070
TWO YEAR WINDOW.

462
00:16:20,071 --> 00:16:21,338
YOU HAVE THE WHITE HOUSE AND THE

463
00:16:21,339 --> 00:16:24,174
SENATE AND YOU HAVE THE HOUSE.

464
00:16:24,175 --> 00:16:25,876
THE AMOUNT OF STUFF THAT THIS

465
00:16:25,877 --> 00:16:27,177
CONGRESS AND THIS ABOUT THE GOT

466
00:16:27,178 --> 00:16:29,980
DONE IN THIS VERY SMALL WINDOW,
CONGRESS AND THIS ABOUT THE GOT

467
00:16:29,981 --> 00:16:29,981
DONE IN THIS VERY SMALL WINDOW,

468
00:16:29,981 --> 00:16:30,614
HISTORIC OPPORTUNITY.

469
00:16:30,615 --> 00:16:32,849
WAS ENORMOUS.

470
00:16:32,850 --> 00:16:37,387
YOU THINK ABOUT TWO SUPREME

471
00:16:37,388 --> 00:16:39,056
COURT JUSTICES.

472
00:16:39,057 --> 00:16:41,992
ISIS, AND NORTH KOREA AND TAX

473
00:16:41,993 --> 00:16:44,762
CUTS AND REPEALING OBAMACARE.

474
00:16:44,763 --> 00:16:45,996
>> NEW NAFTA.

475
00:16:45,997 --> 00:16:48,198
>> A SWEEP OF THE AGENDA FOR THE

476
00:16:48,199 --> 00:16:49,366
CONSERVATIVE CAUSE.

477
00:16:49,367 --> 00:16:51,101
I THINK PEOPLE RESPECT THE FACT

478
00:16:51,102 --> 00:16:52,903
THAT THIS PRESIDENT DID NOT BACK
I THINK PEOPLE RESPECT THE FACT

479
00:16:52,904 --> 00:16:52,904
THAT THIS PRESIDENT DID NOT BACK

480
00:16:52,904 --> 00:16:53,237
DOWN.

481
00:16:53,238 --> 00:16:54,338
THAT MITCH MCCONNELL DID NOT

482
00:16:54,339 --> 00:16:55,239
BACK DOWN.

483
00:16:55,240 --> 00:16:57,308
A LOT OF REPUBLICANS WOULD HAVE

484
00:16:57,309 --> 00:16:58,876
GOTTEN SQUISHY IN THIS SITUATION
A LOT OF REPUBLICANS WOULD HAVE

485
00:16:58,877 --> 00:16:58,877
GOTTEN SQUISHY IN THIS SITUATION

486
00:16:58,877 --> 00:17:06,684
IN THE FACE OF THIS HYSTERICAL

487
00:17:06,685 --> 00:17:07,852
DEMOCRATIC ONSLAUGHT.

488
00:17:07,853 --> 00:17:09,687
THEY HUNG TOUGH AND BASED IT ON

489
00:17:09,688 --> 00:17:09,987
FACTS.

490
00:17:09,988 --> 00:17:12,523
I BELIEVE THEY WILL BE REWARDED

491
00:17:12,523 --> 00:17:15,091
FOR THAT IN THE MID-TERMS.

492
00:17:15,093 --> 00:17:15,860
>> SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM SAID

493
00:17:15,861 --> 00:17:17,495
NOTHING BROUGHT THE REPUBLICANS

494
00:17:17,496 --> 00:17:20,631
TOGETHER LIKE THIS HAS.

495
00:17:20,632 --> 00:17:23,768
HE IS NOT PARTISAN.

496
00:17:23,769 --> 00:17:24,502
YOU NEVER KNOW WHERE LINDSEY

497
00:17:24,502 --> 00:17:26,603
GRAHAM IS COMING FROM.

498
00:17:26,605 --> 00:17:29,240
HE IS UP SET AT THE PRESIDENT

499
00:17:29,241 --> 00:17:30,274
BEING NICE TO THE NORTH KOREA

500
00:17:30,275 --> 00:17:31,476
LEADER AND GOLFING WITH HIM ON

501
00:17:31,477 --> 00:17:32,443
THE WEEKENDS.

502
00:17:32,444 --> 00:17:34,846
THAT’S WHY HE IS SO VALUABLE NOW

503
00:17:34,847 --> 00:17:35,179
OVERALL.

504
00:17:35,180 --> 00:17:36,814
A COUPLE OF THINGS HAPPENED.

505
00:17:36,815 --> 00:17:41,386
IN THE BEGINNING "ME TOO" AND

506
00:17:41,387 --> 00:17:43,121
HARVEY WEINSTEIN.

507
00:17:43,122 --> 00:17:44,489
SEXUAL ASSAULT IS SERIOUS.

508
00:17:44,490 --> 00:17:46,257
BUT IT CHANGED DID HE DO IT BACK

509
00:17:46,258 --> 00:17:46,925
IN HIGH SCHOOL?

510
00:17:46,926 --> 00:17:47,525
WHAT HAPPENED?

511
00:17:47,526 --> 00:17:49,928
ALL OF A SUDDEN PEOPLE SAID

512
00:17:49,929 --> 00:17:51,896
WOMEN SHOULD GET THEIR RIGHTS

513
00:17:51,897 --> 00:17:54,466
AND BE HEARD, THEY HAVE SONS,

514
00:17:54,467 --> 00:17:59,037
BROTHERS, HUSBANDS AND WONDER

515
00:17:59,038 --> 00:18:02,874
WHAT IF WOMEN ALSO HAVE A MALE

516
00:18:02,875 --> 00:18:04,242
COUNTERPART WHO FIND THEMSELVES

517
00:18:04,243 --> 00:18:06,912
IN TROUBLE?

518
00:18:06,913 --> 00:18:09,114
THE THIRD THING WAS IN MY

519
00:18:09,115 --> 00:18:10,782
UNOFFICIAL POLL, A LOT OF PEOPLE

520
00:18:10,783 --> 00:18:12,250
DRANK IN HIGH SCHOOL AND

521
00:18:12,251 --> 00:18:13,652
COLLEGE.

522
00:18:13,653 --> 00:18:15,254
ESPECIALLY WHEN THE AGE WAS 18.

523
00:18:15,255 --> 00:18:16,288
>> DID THEY THROW ICE?

524
00:18:16,289 --> 00:18:19,791
>> THAT’S WHAT I AM SAYING.

525
00:18:19,792 --> 00:18:21,260
THEY WENT FROM SEXUAL ASSAULT

526
00:18:21,261 --> 00:18:28,667
DEAD SERIOUS TO A

527
00:18:28,668 --> 00:18:29,868
DEAD SERIOUS TO I HAD A FEW

528
00:18:29,869 --> 00:18:31,303
BEERS IN HIGH SCHOOL.

529
00:18:31,304 --> 00:18:33,172
PEOPLE SAY NOW YOU CAN’T HAVE A

530
00:18:33,173 --> 00:18:35,307
BEER IN HIGH SCHOOL OR COLLEGE.

531
00:18:35,308 --> 00:18:36,575
IF SOMEONE IN THE HALLWAY

532
00:18:36,576 --> 00:18:38,944
DOESN’T LIKE YOU, THEY BECOME A

533
00:18:38,945 --> 00:18:39,245
STAR.

534
00:18:39,246 --> 00:18:42,114
>> IT DOESN’T MATTER WHAT AGE

535
00:18:42,115 --> 00:18:42,815
SEXUAL ASSAULT OCCURS.

536
00:18:42,816 --> 00:18:44,116
>> IT MATTERS IF IT OCCURRED.

537
00:18:44,117 --> 00:18:47,086
>> IT MATTERS THAT PEOPLE ARE

538
00:18:47,087 --> 00:18:50,389
ABLE TO DESCRIBE THEIR TRAUMA

539
00:18:50,390 --> 00:18:53,726
AND SPEAK THEIR TRUTH.

540
00:18:53,727 --> 00:18:56,796
>> TREAT IT SERIOUSLY.

541
00:18:56,797 --> 00:18:58,598
>> IT RUINS LIVES AND NOT JUST

542
00:18:58,599 --> 00:19:00,333
IN TERMS OF PUBLIC REPUTATION

543
00:19:00,334 --> 00:19:03,035
BUT IN TERMS OF PEOPLE’S ABILITY

544
00:19:03,036 --> 00:19:08,274
TO LIVE THEIR TRUTH.

545
00:19:08,275 --> 00:19:11,244
SEXUAL ASSAULT AND SEXUAL

546
00:19:11,245 --> 00:19:13,546
HARASSMENT ARE BOTH CRIMES.

547
00:19:13,547 --> 00:19:15,381
THEY WERE NOT RECOGNIZED AS A

548
00:19:15,382 --> 00:19:18,852
CRIME 5 DECADES AGO?

549
00:19:18,853 --> 00:19:20,320
>> SEXUAL ASSAULT?

550
00:19:20,321 --> 00:19:21,387
>> SEXUAL HARASSMENT.

551
00:19:21,388 --> 00:19:23,156
>> OKAY, SEPARATE THEM.

552
00:19:23,157 --> 00:19:26,025
>> TWO DIFFERENT THINGS AS YOU

553
00:19:26,026 --> 00:19:26,326
KNOW.

554
00:19:26,327 --> 00:19:28,228
ONE YEAR AGO AFTER THE "ME TOO"

555
00:19:28,229 --> 00:19:30,764
MOVEMENT CAME ABOUT, NINE

556
00:19:30,765 --> 00:19:32,332
MEMBERS OF CONGRESS HAD TO

557
00:19:32,333 --> 00:19:35,735
RESIGN BECAUSE OF ALLEGATIONS OF

558
00:19:35,736 --> 00:19:37,537
SEXUAL ASSAULT.

559
00:19:37,538 --> 00:19:38,805
THEN THERE HAS BEEN 2 WHITE

560
00:19:38,806 --> 00:19:44,010
HOUSE AIDES WHO HAD TO STEP DOWN

561

OF THOSE PEOPLE, THEY DID IT.

569
00:20:00,895 --> 00:20:02,729
THEY SHOULD RESIGN.

570
00:20:02,730 --> 00:20:04,064
THEY SHOULD GET OUT.

571
00:20:04,065 --> 00:20:05,566
BRETT KAVANAUGH SAID I NEVER MET

572
00:20:05,567 --> 00:20:05,899

573
00:20:05,900 --> 00:20:09,636

WHAT YOU ARE DOING, YOU ARE

579
00:20:17,412 --> 00:20:18,679
GENERALIZING BEHAVIOR TO AN

EXAMPLES.

583
00:20:22,083 --> 00:20:25,519
YOU ARE GENERALIZING TO SOMEBODY

584
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:28,022
WHO IS INNOCENT.

585
00:20:28,023 --> 00:20:30,624
JUST BECAUSE SOMEONE ELSE DID

586
00:20:30,625 --> 00:20:32,093
SOMETHING, DOESN’T MEAN THIS

587
00:20:32,094 --> 00:20:34,495
PERSON DID IT.

588
00:20:34,496 --> 00:20:35,863
THAT’S CALLED PREJUDICE.

589
00:20:35,864 --> 00:20:37,198
TAKING AWAY THE RIGHTS OF THE

590
00:20:37,199 --> 00:20:38,032
INDIVIDUAL IS PREJUDICE.

591
00:20:38,033 --> 00:20:39,600
THAT’S WHY THIS MID-TERM IS SO

592
00:20:39,601 --> 00:20:40,434
IMPORTANT.

593
00:20:40,435 --> 00:20:42,170
WE NEED TO TEACH THE DEMOCRATIC

612
00:21:29,819 --> 00:21:32,521
THAT WAS GEORGE HERBERT WALKER

BUSH AND A DEMOCRATIC CHAIR SAID

614
00:21:34,223 --> 00:21:35,223
INVESTIGATE THESE ALLEGATIONS.

615
00:21:35,224 --> 00:21:36,892
THAT’S THE POINT I AM MAKING.

616
00:21:36,893 --> 00:21:39,461
I AM NOT GENERALIZING.
