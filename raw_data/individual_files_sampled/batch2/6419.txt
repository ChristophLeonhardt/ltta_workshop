just Democrats the strong progressive wing of the Democratic Party was launched earlier this year in fact a couple of days after Donald Trump's inauguration I was one of the founders and I'm still one of the founders of course by definition anyway and so Scott kolinsky from the TYT Network his shows a secular target check it out and the rest of the team is largely from Bernie Sanders campaign in 2016 so real progressives real strong and totally uncorrupted no PAC money okay we're not interested in corporate money and we're not taking corporate PAC money go to just Democrats comm and read the entire platform if you're a progressive I think you'll love it and it is actually deeply popular with Americans almost everything on that platform tests and a majority of Americans agree I'm almost all of it at over 60% of Americans agreeing so why wouldn't people run on it well don't worry they are and here comes the candidates so so far just Democrats had 16 candidates until yesterday let me show you who those folks are by the way look at how wonderful that diversity is okay and one is an incumbent ROH Khanna everyone else is running in primaries some in Republican seats some in Democratic seats we have no issue with replacing corporate Democrats we'd love to do that of course the ultimate objective is to replace Republicans and actually get progressive policies but now let me show you another picture we now have 29 candidates 13 new candidates announced today and you've got to raise money for these folks if you don't want corporate money taking over our politics we've got to fighting with small donor money we don't need anywhere near the amount of money do they have but we do need money for infrastructure and 29 candidates is a lot of candidates so go to justice Democrats calm slash go and make your voice heard replace corporate Democrats most importantly replace those right-wing conservatives I just want to tell you about two of them you should please go to the website and check out all their stories and and also make sure that you've got adjust Democrats in your neck of the woods and if you do please support them Valen here donate do whatever you need to do okay so just king is a candidate in Pennsylvania's 16th district she's going against incumbent Lloyd Schmucker he's a Republican and he has a distinction of having raised the most amount of money in the house from the NRA so he's completely unmoved by all the massacres all the mass shootings it continues to take a tremendous amount of NRA money and do exactly what he's paid to do that's exactly the kind of corruption we can't stand now if you say well he's a Republican in wife's being that part of Pennsylvania that's deeply read yes and no this is an R plus 5 seat meaning the Republicans have an advantage of just 5 points and in 2008 Obama won this district so it is winnable once the corporate Democrats get out of the way and we actually run strongly progressive campaigns that appeal to voters things like Medicare for all so you all have insurance not just some of us cause for also your kids can actually live the American Dream not just rich people's kids $15 minimum wage so you can actually have a living wage and and not be paid seven dollars and 25 cents which is atrociously low but Smuckers gonna argue for lower wages have that argument can't wait and the fact that the corporate democrats don't fight the republicans on things when they say we should have lower wages is insane jess is not gonna make that mistake just as democrats are not gonna make that mistake so go support Jess King and then I want to tell you about Doug Applegate he's a marine colonel and unabashed Bernie supporter and progressive and he's running against darrell Issa you know he almost beat him last time he only lost by 1,500 votes it darrell Issa was such a special snowflake that when Applegate ran accurate ads about him he went and cried to the courts and said you should about me not there well the court disagreed and made eisah pay Applegate $45,000 which is awesome see that's a real fighter Isis this close to losing is one of the worst because in Congress go make that happen go to justice Democrats calm / go real progressives running real strong campaigns for real change you support all the candidates when you go to just a quick hats calm / go make it happen today I'm excited man can you imagine let us whisper of a dream I mean look I want all in the wind but if if just half of those 29 candidates won and also they were you know 15 just Democrats in the house that would be an earthquake everybody in Washington would go what is this because right now I got to be honest with you they have tremendous disdain for progressives they think oh you guys have no real power you're never gonna do anything you're never gonna win elections please please prove them wrong these are great candidates Cory Bush is leading the protest in st. Louis she's a real fighter think democratic and come in there lacy clays got clay feet doesn't show up to any of the protests he says oh I'm not like my dad his dad was an actual civil rights leader does that mean I'm not like my dad it shouldn't you be embarrassed that you're not like your dad and you're not showing up and leading the people you were supposed to represent I can go on and on pollachius Swearengen it going running as joe Manchin in West Virginia let's go let's go that's why it's just this Democrats that cops I should go let's get progressive victories I know we can if you liked this video you probably like independent media the best way to support independent media become a member of the Young Turks TYT Network comm slash join
