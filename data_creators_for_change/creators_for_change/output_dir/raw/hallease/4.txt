1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:01,570
- Hey, everyone, I'm Hallease Beast,

2
00:00:01,570 --> 00:00:04,130
a digital storyteller and video producer.

3
00:00:04,130 --> 00:00:05,440
- Hey, and I'm Mr. Hallease.

4
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:08,660
I am a fan of Aqua Lungers,

5
00:00:08,660 --> 00:00:10,830
which is made by WarpedCore Studios

6
00:00:10,830 --> 00:00:13,233
and available on Steam, and I'm a nurse.

7
00:00:13,233 --> 00:00:14,360
(Hallease laughs)

8
00:00:14,360 --> 00:00:16,656
- Wow, and this is the Beast Cast,

9
00:00:16,656 --> 00:00:18,380
your favorite aunt and uncle

10
00:00:18,380 --> 00:00:20,120
talking about all things married life,

11
00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:22,440
and things like such as.

12
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:23,844
- Roll the music!

13
00:00:23,844 --> 00:00:26,927
(electro punk music)

14
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:38,610
- So, Mr. Hallease mentioned Aqua Lungers.

15
00:00:38,610 --> 00:00:41,220
That is our friend Diego's video game

16
00:00:41,220 --> 00:00:42,330
that he came out with.

17
00:00:42,330 --> 00:00:44,030
He built the whole thing from scratch

18
00:00:44,030 --> 00:00:49,030
and we're just like, we're
fans of just him, so.

19
00:00:49,547 --> 00:00:51,490
- And it's a fun game.

20
00:00:51,490 --> 00:00:53,180
- It's like legitimately a good game.

21
00:00:53,180 --> 00:00:56,870
If you follow this channel,
then you have seen Diego before.

22
00:00:56,870 --> 00:00:58,570
Anyway, we can't. (laughs)

23
00:00:58,570 --> 00:01:01,080
- I'm just saying--
- Well, we can.

24
00:01:01,080 --> 00:01:04,104
But you know, they wanna get
to the meat of the content.

25
00:01:04,104 --> 00:01:05,096
- He's a good dude.

26
00:01:05,096 --> 00:01:05,929
- He is a very good dude.

27
00:01:05,929 --> 00:01:07,670
- Today's content, or today's topic is.

28
00:01:07,670 --> 00:01:09,600
- Yes, so today's topic,

29
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:13,470
in true clickbait fashion, and
riding a wave, if you will.

30
00:01:13,470 --> 00:01:17,830
We're discussing Will Smith
and Jada Pinkett Smith's--

31
00:01:17,830 --> 00:01:20,143
- Red Table.
- Red Table Talk episode.

32
00:01:20,143 --> 00:01:22,607
Because why not, you know?

33
00:01:22,607 --> 00:01:24,232
Those of y'all listening,

34
00:01:24,232 --> 00:01:27,784
these podcast episodes
end up on YouTube as well.

35
00:01:27,784 --> 00:01:30,580
But if you watch Will Smith on YouTube,

36
00:01:30,580 --> 00:01:35,530
he literally did like a
crossover platform situation

37
00:01:35,530 --> 00:01:36,780
in one of his vlogs.

38
00:01:36,780 --> 00:01:40,540
And essentially cross-promoted
not only his YouTube channel

39
00:01:40,540 --> 00:01:43,250
but also Red Table Talk,
which is his wife's show

40
00:01:43,250 --> 00:01:44,900
that is on Facebook.

41
00:01:44,900 --> 00:01:47,830
And so for me as a video
producer watching it,

42
00:01:47,830 --> 00:01:50,207
like watching the whole
crossover of two different

43
00:01:50,207 --> 00:01:55,207
essentially arenas in
content creation, I was like,

44
00:01:55,431 --> 00:02:00,230
Dag, y'all did that, you know? (laughing)

45
00:02:00,230 --> 00:02:04,140
So purely from the production
perspective, mad respect.

46
00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:08,210
I wanted to talk about, there
was a point in that episode

47
00:02:08,210 --> 00:02:11,326
that they discussed that
hit me that I wanted to like

48
00:02:11,326 --> 00:02:15,530
dive in with you a little
bit in relation to us.

49
00:02:15,530 --> 00:02:17,440
And so I'm gonna play it

50
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:18,997
so y'all can hear/see it.

51
00:02:18,997 --> 00:02:21,390
- You know how, I'm a scientist.

52
00:02:21,390 --> 00:02:22,920
So everything is science for me.

53
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:24,467
- Yes.

54
00:02:24,467 --> 00:02:27,237
- I read somethin' when
we first got together

55
00:02:27,237 --> 00:02:32,237
that the most successful men
in history have been married.

56
00:02:34,119 --> 00:02:35,377
- Right.

57
00:02:35,377 --> 00:02:36,210
- Right?
- Right.

58
00:02:37,558 --> 00:02:42,558
- And for me, I knew that
I would squander my life

59
00:02:43,010 --> 00:02:44,370
if I was runnin' around.

60
00:02:44,370 --> 00:02:45,743
- Yeah.
- Right, okay.

61
00:02:47,001 --> 00:02:51,613
- The way my mind works, I
can only excel for a woman.

62
00:02:52,782 --> 00:02:54,938
- Aw!
- Like I can't--

63
00:02:54,938 --> 00:02:56,498
- Aw!
(laughing)

64
00:02:56,498 --> 00:02:59,000
- I think a lot of men
are like that, though.

65
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:03,730
I think women are true motivators for men.

66
00:03:03,730 --> 00:03:08,730
- And the one thing that I
think has been the greatest

67
00:03:10,430 --> 00:03:13,470
motivator and asset for me with you

68
00:03:13,470 --> 00:03:17,820
is your absolute refusal
to accept anything from me

69
00:03:17,820 --> 00:03:20,190
other than the best that
I could possibly be.

70
00:03:20,190 --> 00:03:21,533
- Right, and vice versa.

71
00:03:22,780 --> 00:03:24,978
- The Aw! from Willow?
- That's his daughter.

72
00:03:24,978 --> 00:03:25,811
- [Both] Yeah.

73
00:03:25,811 --> 00:03:26,810
- No, I'm just hearing the
Aw, and it's like, well,

74
00:03:26,810 --> 00:03:28,402
so you're Aw-ing--

75
00:03:28,402 --> 00:03:29,830
- That's a little
condescending. (chuckles)

76
00:03:29,830 --> 00:03:31,440
- It is condescending and
I'm sorry that it is, but.

77
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:34,576
- No, her, she is a little
condescending in that.

78
00:03:34,576 --> 00:03:36,323
- So I don't think that is condescending,

79
00:03:36,323 --> 00:03:37,773
I just think that is naivete.

80
00:03:39,750 --> 00:03:42,406
Because she's like, Oh, well, my.

81
00:03:42,406 --> 00:03:44,270
I'm hearing like a romantic thing

82
00:03:44,270 --> 00:03:46,350
and I'm hearing a romantic
thing coming from my dad.

83
00:03:46,350 --> 00:03:48,310
Your father figure is
kind of like who you base

84
00:03:48,310 --> 00:03:50,590
and who you compare other males into.

85
00:03:50,590 --> 00:03:51,423
Man, this is--
- That's true.

86
00:03:51,423 --> 00:03:52,871
- This is another podcast episode.

87
00:03:52,871 --> 00:03:54,341
- Which is true, yeah.

88
00:03:54,341 --> 00:03:55,330
- Anyway, but she was
like, Aw, that's so cute.

89
00:03:55,330 --> 00:03:57,240
And it's like, yeah, but,

90
00:03:57,240 --> 00:04:00,400
if you listen.
- If you really listen.

91
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:02,370
- Or if you listen to like
everything else that we heard,

92
00:04:02,370 --> 00:04:03,430
and again, that's all editing,

93
00:04:03,430 --> 00:04:05,760
but everything else leading up to that

94
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:08,640
was how there was friction
and there was stuff going on.

95
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:10,320
And then just like,
this one romantic thing.

96
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:11,723
Aw!
- Yeah.

97
00:04:11,723 --> 00:04:14,290
I found it very interesting
'cause I could see that parallel

98
00:04:14,290 --> 00:04:15,601
with you and I as well.

99
00:04:15,601 --> 00:04:20,019
I feel like once the
more serious we became,

100
00:04:20,019 --> 00:04:24,550
the more serious you became
about your own trajectory

101
00:04:24,550 --> 00:04:26,290
and where you were trying to go.

102
00:04:26,290 --> 00:04:27,780
- You mind if I take first crack at this?

103
00:04:27,780 --> 00:04:30,124
- No, 'cause the other
thing I don't wanna reduce

104
00:04:30,124 --> 00:04:34,090
the reason why you've had the trajectory

105
00:04:34,090 --> 00:04:35,980
of a career you've had is
because you got married.

106
00:04:35,980 --> 00:04:37,860
I don't wanna reduce it to that, either.

107
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:40,500
I just wanna see how much of
it really was a factor for you.

108
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:44,660
- So initially I didn't
think that I fell under that.

109
00:04:44,660 --> 00:04:48,360
That I also found that a
woman, or like my partner,

110
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:50,400
was a strong motivator for me.

111
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:52,990
But then you reminded me, No,
remember when we got married.

112
00:04:52,990 --> 00:04:55,840
And then the brain remembered.

113
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:59,120
Oh, right, I worked that much harder.

114
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:01,770
There was that much more
drive to get something done.

115
00:05:03,430 --> 00:05:05,321
So there's intrinsic and extrinsic factors

116
00:05:05,321 --> 00:05:08,970
into why that's true, for me at least.

117
00:05:08,970 --> 00:05:11,670
So intrinsically, within
the marriage itself,

118
00:05:11,670 --> 00:05:12,920
just between the two partners.

119
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:16,144
Your life decisions affect two people now.

120
00:05:16,144 --> 00:05:18,590
So regardless of how much
communication you have

121
00:05:18,590 --> 00:05:21,189
between you and your spouse,
you are always gonna feel

122
00:05:21,189 --> 00:05:25,713
that there's kinda this
unspoken like expectation.

123
00:05:26,570 --> 00:05:31,570
That you know, again, it's not
just my life, it's our life.

124
00:05:31,930 --> 00:05:34,190
And so it's not just my
income, it's our income.

125
00:05:34,190 --> 00:05:36,114
And so regardless of
whether they're saying,

126
00:05:36,114 --> 00:05:38,400
Oh, well we don't have enough money,

127
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:40,040
or you know, It'd be nice
if we had this or that.

128
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:42,160
And like beyond materialistic stuff.

129
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:47,160
You just feel like, Am I
doing enough for our unit?

130
00:05:47,339 --> 00:05:49,770
Excuse me, and at the time
when we first got married,

131
00:05:49,770 --> 00:05:51,291
the answer was obviously No.

132
00:05:51,291 --> 00:05:52,310
(Hallease laughs)

133
00:05:52,310 --> 00:05:54,440
But and then if you look extrinsic,

134
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:56,704
like external to the marriage,

135
00:05:56,704 --> 00:06:00,380
then there's the family.

136
00:06:00,380 --> 00:06:03,923
So it's not necessarily my
family, it's more your family.

137
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:08,310
And again, not that there was
any pressure or expectations,

138
00:06:08,310 --> 00:06:11,424
but there was the perceived pressures of,

139
00:06:11,424 --> 00:06:13,280
How are you providing for my daughter?

140
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:16,629
And again, all of this is very, you know,

141
00:06:16,629 --> 00:06:17,803
very hetero or whatever.

142
00:06:17,803 --> 00:06:19,980
And then aside from that,

143
00:06:19,980 --> 00:06:20,813
there's society.
- Right.

144
00:06:20,813 --> 00:06:22,430
- So it's like, How are y'all doin',

145
00:06:22,430 --> 00:06:23,490
What are you doing?

146
00:06:23,490 --> 00:06:25,810
- And when they say, How are y'all doing,

147
00:06:25,810 --> 00:06:27,860
there's this unspoken understanding

148
00:06:27,860 --> 00:06:30,054
that most people are
coming at that from like,

149
00:06:30,054 --> 00:06:33,240
if they're asking me it's more like,

150
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:36,855
Are you as the wife being
provided for, you know?

151
00:06:36,855 --> 00:06:41,619
That's like the perception,
the projection that's onto you.

152
00:06:41,619 --> 00:06:44,460
- From the male perspective,
it's, How are you providing

153
00:06:44,460 --> 00:06:47,113
for your family or unit or whatever.

154
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:52,070
And again, we talked about
this last night at dinner.

155
00:06:52,070 --> 00:06:56,431
Talking about the perils of maleness.

156
00:06:56,431 --> 00:06:57,436
(Hallease laughs)

157
00:06:57,436 --> 00:06:59,014
You know, it's like, (moans).

158
00:06:59,014 --> 00:07:00,350
- It must be so hard being a man. (laughs)

159
00:07:00,350 --> 00:07:05,350
- Just having the burden of
carrying around male genitalia.

160
00:07:05,355 --> 00:07:06,480
(Hallease laughs)

161
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:09,213
It's just like, it wears on you.

162
00:07:11,369 --> 00:07:13,046
Having all of that privilege.

163
00:07:13,046 --> 00:07:13,879
- I know!

164
00:07:13,879 --> 00:07:18,879
But there is something, which
is why feminism is important.

165
00:07:19,330 --> 00:07:21,261
Because then it becomes, it's not about,

166
00:07:21,261 --> 00:07:23,740
Oh, well just women need to be on top.

167
00:07:23,740 --> 00:07:27,180
No, it's about pulling away some of that

168
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:33,700
pressure and strain that is not necessary.

169
00:07:33,700 --> 00:07:38,100
It's not necessary for you
to feel this way as a man,

170
00:07:38,100 --> 00:07:41,190
what you need to provide
to me as your wife,

171
00:07:41,190 --> 00:07:43,760
if anything at all, you know?

172
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:48,000
Equality, part of that is
like, it will trickle up,

173
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,696
it will help you. (laughs)

174
00:07:49,696 --> 00:07:52,750
- So what really like,
aside from you know,

175
00:07:52,750 --> 00:07:54,457
there's like internal
and external factors.

176
00:07:54,457 --> 00:07:58,508
It's really like being in a
marriage holds up a mirror

177
00:07:58,508 --> 00:08:00,500
to your life.

178
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:03,460
If someone holds up a
mirror to you in a marriage,

179
00:08:03,460 --> 00:08:05,365
and you do not see...

180
00:08:05,365 --> 00:08:08,244
It shouldn't be like, Oh, I see my flaws.

181
00:08:08,244 --> 00:08:11,060
It should be like, Oh, I see the ways

182
00:08:11,060 --> 00:08:12,818
that I should be improving.

183
00:08:12,818 --> 00:08:16,320
But yeah, so it's not like me feeling like

184
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:19,760
I need to be the pinnacle, I
need to be like the fulcrum,

185
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:22,460
the thing that like holds
everything up, right?

186
00:08:22,460 --> 00:08:25,760
But it's, Am I contributing
as much as I could?

187
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:28,463
No, do I have the drive to do better, yes.

188
00:08:28,463 --> 00:08:30,500
Do I have the means of doing better, yes.

189
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:33,293
I have the mental faculties
and I have the education.

190
00:08:33,293 --> 00:08:37,763
And the ability to get student
loans or whatever, but.

191
00:08:37,763 --> 00:08:38,596
(Hallease laughs)

192
00:08:38,596 --> 00:08:41,381
Like I have the means, I know
which resources to tap into

193
00:08:41,381 --> 00:08:43,289
to achieve this.

194
00:08:43,289 --> 00:08:45,378
Do I have the drive to achieve it, yes.

195
00:08:45,378 --> 00:08:46,638
Then do it.

196
00:08:46,638 --> 00:08:48,676
- Hey.
- Hi.

197
00:08:48,676 --> 00:08:50,377
- Hi.
- It's good to smeet you.

198
00:08:50,377 --> 00:08:53,313
- (laughs) It's good to smeet you.

199
00:08:53,313 --> 00:08:57,570
Thank you for checking in on
this Beast Cast videocast.

200
00:08:57,570 --> 00:08:59,367
If you don't know already,

201
00:08:59,367 --> 00:09:03,670
you can support this
Beast Cast in a few ways.

202
00:09:03,670 --> 00:09:05,330
The first being,

203
00:09:05,330 --> 00:09:06,343
let the ads play.

204
00:09:07,370 --> 00:09:08,320
- Let 'em play out.

205
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:09,870
We know they're ridiculous sometimes.

206
00:09:09,870 --> 00:09:10,992
- Very ridiculous.

207
00:09:10,992 --> 00:09:11,970
- We know there's a lot
of propaganda out there.

208
00:09:11,970 --> 00:09:14,110
We know there's some ridiculous stuff

209
00:09:14,110 --> 00:09:15,739
bein' pushed onto you.

210
00:09:15,739 --> 00:09:18,980
But if the spirit moves you.

211
00:09:18,980 --> 00:09:20,330
- It does help.

212
00:09:20,330 --> 00:09:21,163
- Let 'em play out.

213
00:09:21,163 --> 00:09:22,620
- Yeah, it helps a lot.

214
00:09:22,620 --> 00:09:25,073
Another thing you can
do is like this video.

215
00:09:25,073 --> 00:09:26,807
That helps as well.

216
00:09:26,807 --> 00:09:30,130
The other thing you can
do is support the channel

217
00:09:30,130 --> 00:09:32,570
on Patreon so that way we can continue

218
00:09:32,570 --> 00:09:35,700
to push out these Beast Casts weekly.

219
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:37,500
Every little bit helps.

220
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:40,140
There's no minimum to what you can give

221
00:09:40,140 --> 00:09:42,050
but you can set a monthly max.

222
00:09:42,050 --> 00:09:46,210
So you know, let it work
within your budget, amen.

223
00:09:46,210 --> 00:09:49,500
And then finally, the other
thing if the spirit moves you,

224
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:51,680
leave a comment below, good or bad.

225
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:54,990
'Cause criticism is
how you grow, you know.

226
00:09:54,990 --> 00:09:56,932
I always want things to get better.

227
00:09:56,932 --> 00:09:59,480
I don't want people to just blindly

228
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:00,930
like everything, you know.

229
00:10:00,930 --> 00:10:03,020
If you have a critique...

230
00:10:04,410 --> 00:10:05,620
Comments below, please leave it.

231
00:10:05,620 --> 00:10:07,090
- But again, keep it constructive.

232
00:10:07,090 --> 00:10:08,320
- Constructive criticism.

233
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:12,944
- Right, if you're gonna talk
about, like, racist things.

234
00:10:12,944 --> 00:10:13,943
(Hallease laughs)

235
00:10:13,943 --> 00:10:14,942
You can do whatever.

236
00:10:14,942 --> 00:10:16,478
- People gonna do what they do, love.

237
00:10:16,478 --> 00:10:17,866
- We will see it.

238
00:10:17,866 --> 00:10:18,699
- People gonna do what they wanna do.

239
00:10:18,699 --> 00:10:19,532
- Well yeah, sure.

240
00:10:19,532 --> 00:10:20,625
- You can't.

241
00:10:20,625 --> 00:10:22,540
People gonna do what they wanna do.

242
00:10:22,540 --> 00:10:24,476
- Just reaching out into the ether,

243
00:10:24,476 --> 00:10:27,740
be positive about it, if
you're gonna do somethin'.

244
00:10:27,740 --> 00:10:29,453
We appreciate it.
- All right, okay, cool.

245
00:10:29,453 --> 00:10:31,170
(Hallease laughs)

246
00:10:31,170 --> 00:10:33,199
- The complete opposite is
gonna happen, cool, right?

247
00:10:33,199 --> 00:10:34,974
- Back to the Beast Cast!
- Whoo!

248
00:10:34,974 --> 00:10:38,159
- For me in my career,
marriage was not the catalyst

249
00:10:38,159 --> 00:10:40,408
for me to push myself.

250
00:10:40,408 --> 00:10:43,810
I always had, I'd been
already doing it, you know.

251
00:10:43,810 --> 00:10:44,810
And you had, too.

252
00:10:44,810 --> 00:10:46,410
'Cause you had already
achieved quite a bit,

253
00:10:46,410 --> 00:10:48,240
considering where you had come from

254
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:49,810
and what you had, you know.

255
00:10:49,810 --> 00:10:51,432
Like, considering your circumstance.

256
00:10:51,432 --> 00:10:52,630
- Dangit, I keep hitting this.

257
00:10:52,630 --> 00:10:56,920
So I mean, I had already, I
had graduated from my college.

258
00:10:56,920 --> 00:10:58,180
- Yeah, he went to, you went to.

259
00:10:58,180 --> 00:10:59,013
You should say that.

260
00:10:59,013 --> 00:11:00,590
You went to Notre Dame, that's a big deal,

261
00:11:00,590 --> 00:11:03,576
considering you're from a
border city, a border town.

262
00:11:03,576 --> 00:11:07,551
You grew up in a more
or less middle class.

263
00:11:07,551 --> 00:11:11,323
- See, but so all of that,
like I had to break away from.

264
00:11:11,323 --> 00:11:13,210
This is like, Oh I
graduated from Notre Dame.

265
00:11:13,210 --> 00:11:15,890
But like to what, like
what did I get out of it?

266
00:11:15,890 --> 00:11:17,920
I had a bachelor's degree.

267
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:19,010
And it was from Notre Dame.

268
00:11:19,010 --> 00:11:20,760
Notre Dame is what it
is, but it's not an Ivy.

269
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:23,158
And it's like there's all these
little detractions, right?

270
00:11:23,158 --> 00:11:28,000
But I graduated, moved back
home, worked as a uniclerk.

271
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:31,254
But I did that for six months
and then saved up enough money

272
00:11:31,254 --> 00:11:33,510
to move to San Antonio.

273
00:11:33,510 --> 00:11:36,750
Found a job in San Antonio
that was just gonna be

274
00:11:36,750 --> 00:11:39,420
the placeholder while
I went back to school.

275
00:11:39,420 --> 00:11:41,192
And I wanted to go back,

276
00:11:41,192 --> 00:11:45,435
get a biology degree, so
I had enrolled at UTSA

277
00:11:45,435 --> 00:11:48,940
to take science courses,
to build up my resume,

278
00:11:48,940 --> 00:11:51,210
to get into med school.

279
00:11:51,210 --> 00:11:53,070
That's what I was trying to do.

280
00:11:53,070 --> 00:11:56,360
But that fell through and
I ended up treading water

281
00:11:56,360 --> 00:11:58,630
in that call center for
a little bit longer,

282
00:11:58,630 --> 00:11:59,463
and just thinking,

283
00:11:59,463 --> 00:12:01,050
Well how can I manifest
this into something?

284
00:12:01,050 --> 00:12:03,589
And then you came along.

285
00:12:03,589 --> 00:12:05,498
Another opportunity had popped up

286
00:12:05,498 --> 00:12:10,498
for me to move into not
administration in a call center,

287
00:12:11,110 --> 00:12:14,650
but like slightly above
like the underlings

288
00:12:14,650 --> 00:12:15,927
that are toiling away

289
00:12:15,927 --> 00:12:16,960
(Hallease laughs)

290
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:17,880
on the phones.

291
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:20,640
And we could've stayed here

292
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:22,215
but it was better for
you to move to Austin.

293
00:12:22,215 --> 00:12:27,213
And so doing a tabula rasa,
like a clean slate thing

294
00:12:27,213 --> 00:12:30,980
in Austin was like, Okay,
I'm back in healthcare

295
00:12:30,980 --> 00:12:33,373
as a uniclerk because that's
the experience that I had.

296
00:12:33,373 --> 00:12:36,609
What can I do to do something with this?

297
00:12:36,609 --> 00:12:41,609
And so there was a drive
but it had stalled.

298
00:12:41,940 --> 00:12:44,340
And then there was that
kickstart again of looking myself

299
00:12:44,340 --> 00:12:46,391
in the mirror, What am I
contributing to the marriage?

300
00:12:46,391 --> 00:12:49,287
My wife is trying to be
successful with stuff.

301
00:12:49,287 --> 00:12:51,523
Is this all I can be?

302
00:12:51,523 --> 00:12:53,190
(Hallease murmurs)

303
00:12:53,190 --> 00:12:55,960
No, so...

304
00:12:55,960 --> 00:12:58,360
Again, it's just like
that self-reflection.

305
00:12:58,360 --> 00:13:00,000
- So would you say that
money is the big motivator

306
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:00,833
for you then?

307
00:13:03,550 --> 00:13:05,785
- Enabling us to have a level of comfort,

308
00:13:05,785 --> 00:13:07,170
that's what it was.

309
00:13:07,170 --> 00:13:08,911
- Okay.
- To me.

310
00:13:08,911 --> 00:13:12,036
But, yeah, so I don't wanna say

311
00:13:12,036 --> 00:13:14,999
again, that the marriage or that you were

312
00:13:14,999 --> 00:13:16,830
what jump-started it for me.

313
00:13:16,830 --> 00:13:21,204
It was just confronting my inner demon.

314
00:13:21,204 --> 00:13:24,060
Confronting my issues of saying like,

315
00:13:24,060 --> 00:13:26,905
I know that you're not
happy with where you're at.

316
00:13:26,905 --> 00:13:29,180
And I know you wanted to do better.

317
00:13:29,180 --> 00:13:31,323
You've wanted to do
better for two years now.

318
00:13:31,323 --> 00:13:33,710
So then do something about it.

319
00:13:33,710 --> 00:13:34,770
- So not settling.

320
00:13:34,770 --> 00:13:36,380
- And the other thing, not settling.

321
00:13:36,380 --> 00:13:38,580
And the other thing is,
when we were dating.

322
00:13:40,030 --> 00:13:42,720
We had come on this conversation before,

323
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:47,720
and you had said if you
ever got to the point

324
00:13:48,260 --> 00:13:52,186
where you were just complacent
and you had no drive,

325
00:13:52,186 --> 00:13:54,940
I don't know if I could be with you.

326
00:13:54,940 --> 00:13:55,773
- Did I say that to you?

327
00:13:55,773 --> 00:13:57,352
- You said that to me.

328
00:13:57,352 --> 00:13:59,090
- Oh! (laughs)

329
00:13:59,090 --> 00:14:00,293
- Well, 'cause essentially it's like,

330
00:14:00,293 --> 00:14:02,290
well if you ever--

331
00:14:02,290 --> 00:14:03,710
- Dang, I was cutthroat. (laughs)

332
00:14:03,710 --> 00:14:05,990
- Well no, I mean, but you made sense.

333
00:14:05,990 --> 00:14:08,900
- Which is true, I can't be
with someone who's complacent.

334
00:14:08,900 --> 00:14:11,030
- Right, so if I woulda just
stayed at a call center,

335
00:14:11,030 --> 00:14:12,485
- Oh yeah, I woulda been like...

336
00:14:12,485 --> 00:14:14,033
- And become like a call center manager,

337
00:14:14,033 --> 00:14:14,866
and then whatever.
- Yeah, no.

338
00:14:14,866 --> 00:14:15,920
Well, not even that, it's not even about--

339
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:17,919
- One, I would've hated myself.

340
00:14:17,919 --> 00:14:19,396
- Well no, it's not even about
where or what you would be.

341
00:14:19,396 --> 00:14:20,830
It's just like, if your drive

342
00:14:20,830 --> 00:14:22,960
is to be the best call
center manager you can be--

343
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:24,910
- Then do it.
- Then, okay.

344
00:14:24,910 --> 00:14:26,620
I can support that drive.

345
00:14:26,620 --> 00:14:28,660
For me it was more just like,
I don't care what you wanna do

346
00:14:28,660 --> 00:14:31,750
with your life, you just need
to have the drive and do it.

347
00:14:31,750 --> 00:14:33,494
- Oh so now you remember!

348
00:14:33,494 --> 00:14:35,256
Now you remember.
(Hallease laughs)

349
00:14:35,256 --> 00:14:37,300
- Yeah. (chuckles)

350
00:14:37,300 --> 00:14:40,090
- But so that was the other impetus,

351
00:14:40,090 --> 00:14:41,670
that was the other spark.
- Dang, I said that?

352
00:14:41,670 --> 00:14:45,800
- Sorry, so I kind of
took the reins there.

353
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:46,790
- No, that's fine.

354
00:14:46,790 --> 00:14:49,113
I mean, like I just wanted
to talk to you about it.

355
00:14:49,113 --> 00:14:52,320
Because the way I heard
that was just, like.

356
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:54,178
I don't know if it's just men,

357
00:14:54,178 --> 00:14:56,020
especially someone like Will Smith.

358
00:14:56,020 --> 00:14:57,320
I mean, he's always had drive.

359
00:14:57,320 --> 00:14:59,222
He was already on Fresh
Prince before he met--

360
00:14:59,222 --> 00:15:00,260
- I just thought that.

361
00:15:00,260 --> 00:15:01,800
- Yeah, he was already on Fresh Prince

362
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:03,681
before he met Jada, right?

363
00:15:03,681 --> 00:15:07,563
So he already obviously
had motivation, obviously.

364
00:15:08,882 --> 00:15:11,740
But the fact that he feels like

365
00:15:11,740 --> 00:15:13,498
the motivation came from her,

366
00:15:13,498 --> 00:15:17,710
rather than of his own accord,
even though it's obvious

367
00:15:17,710 --> 00:15:19,429
if you see the trajectory of his career,

368
00:15:19,429 --> 00:15:21,929
he already had it, you know?

369
00:15:21,929 --> 00:15:24,030
Why her?

370
00:15:24,030 --> 00:15:29,030
Or like, why is he reducing
his own motivation to her?

371
00:15:29,618 --> 00:15:33,309
- That might've just been the
fact that he's playing to,

372
00:15:33,309 --> 00:15:35,390
which audience are you playing to?

373
00:15:35,390 --> 00:15:37,400
- Mm, okay.

374
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:38,233
That's a fair point.

375
00:15:38,233 --> 00:15:39,110
- Who listens to Red Table?

376
00:15:39,110 --> 00:15:40,440
- Yeah, it's gonna be
mostly women, I mean.

377
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:42,580
- Right, but you elicit the same response

378
00:15:42,580 --> 00:15:43,860
that his daughter had.

379
00:15:43,860 --> 00:15:46,532
Which was you hear this wholesome man,

380
00:15:46,532 --> 00:15:49,885
this like, I mean, essentially
America's sweetheart.

381
00:15:49,885 --> 00:15:52,040
- Yeah, yeah totally.
- As a man.

382
00:15:52,040 --> 00:15:55,240
This really approachable, like, dude.

383
00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:57,552
And he says, Oh I would not be able to,

384
00:15:57,552 --> 00:16:00,047
like I would've squandered my life, like,

385
00:16:00,047 --> 00:16:02,570
looking for something,
if I wasn't with you.

386
00:16:02,570 --> 00:16:03,403
Something along those lines.

387
00:16:03,403 --> 00:16:05,280
- Well squandered, he's talking
about like if he was playing

388
00:16:05,280 --> 00:16:07,520
fast and loose and just
having women, and you know.

389
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:09,610
- Or just like not being in a
stable relationship, I guess.

390
00:16:09,610 --> 00:16:10,786
- Right, yeah.

391
00:16:10,786 --> 00:16:12,793
- And then his daughter
cooed at it, and she said,

392
00:16:12,793 --> 00:16:13,979
- [Both] Aw.

393
00:16:13,979 --> 00:16:14,812
- And that's the reaction--

394
00:16:14,812 --> 00:16:17,410
- That he wants everyone
watching online to have.

395
00:16:17,410 --> 00:16:20,177
- And again, we're not saying
that he's manipulative, but.

396
00:16:20,177 --> 00:16:21,910
- No, that could genuinely be.

397
00:16:21,910 --> 00:16:24,050
- If you see how well
catered all of this was,

398
00:16:24,050 --> 00:16:25,504
and your point--

399
00:16:25,504 --> 00:16:26,559
- Yes. (laughs)

400
00:16:26,559 --> 00:16:27,910
- How am I, like I expect it now.

401
00:16:27,910 --> 00:16:29,130
Like that's probably what he did.

402
00:16:29,130 --> 00:16:32,755
- Right, and he even mentions in part two

403
00:16:32,755 --> 00:16:35,250
where they talk about he is very,

404
00:16:35,250 --> 00:16:37,502
he talks about how he was very aware

405
00:16:37,502 --> 00:16:42,140
of how his family is
perceived by everybody.

406
00:16:42,140 --> 00:16:46,430
Which, to his credit,
you should be, you know.

407
00:16:46,430 --> 00:16:48,833
If you have that much
clout around yourself,

408
00:16:48,833 --> 00:16:52,874
unfortunately, you need to
be self-aware, you know.

409
00:16:52,874 --> 00:16:55,850
- Right, everything you say--
- Everything you say and do--

410
00:16:55,850 --> 00:16:57,310
- Will be worked over
with a fine-tooth comb.

411
00:16:57,310 --> 00:16:59,510
- Does matter, so you
have to have that level

412
00:16:59,510 --> 00:17:01,370
of self-awareness in your life.

413
00:17:01,370 --> 00:17:04,646
Even with us, like,
we're nobody. (chuckles)

414
00:17:04,646 --> 00:17:08,367
And I am still self-aware
of what I represent.

415
00:17:08,367 --> 00:17:09,729
- I am a somebody.

416
00:17:09,730 --> 00:17:11,157
- To you.

417
00:17:11,157 --> 00:17:12,797
- I am a strong, independent woman.

418
00:17:12,798 --> 00:17:13,967
(Hallease laughs)

419
00:17:13,967 --> 00:17:15,010
Who plays Aqua Lungers.

420
00:17:15,010 --> 00:17:16,631
Aqua Lungers out on Steam.

421
00:17:16,631 --> 00:17:18,305
- Stop it. (laughs)

422
00:17:18,305 --> 00:17:20,551
But I'm very much aware of just

423
00:17:20,551 --> 00:17:24,969
how I am perceived by everyone.

424
00:17:24,970 --> 00:17:27,162
- I mean, so okay, let's do the feminist,

425
00:17:27,162 --> 00:17:29,880
let's play this from a
feminist spin then, right?

426
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:30,750
- Okay, yeah.

427
00:17:30,750 --> 00:17:34,994
- So why is he saying that
a woman has to be an object

428
00:17:34,994 --> 00:17:37,483
of like manipulation?

429
00:17:37,483 --> 00:17:38,620
- Oh!
- So it's like,

430
00:17:38,620 --> 00:17:41,612
Oh, well, I find that I work best

431
00:17:41,612 --> 00:17:44,620
through like, with a woman.

432
00:17:44,620 --> 00:17:47,684
Not necessarily pushing
me, but like for a woman.

433
00:17:47,684 --> 00:17:50,780
And it's like, that sounds
like it should be empowering

434
00:17:50,780 --> 00:17:52,293
to a woman--
- But it's not.

435
00:17:52,293 --> 00:17:53,930
- But it's really more like
you're just using them.

436
00:17:53,930 --> 00:17:55,580
- Which, that's gonna be the next thing

437
00:17:55,580 --> 00:17:56,413
I was gonna bring up.

438
00:17:56,413 --> 00:17:58,563
- For your own gain, sorry.
- When she, when they talk--

439
00:17:58,563 --> 00:18:00,900
No but yeah, when she talked about.

440
00:18:00,900 --> 00:18:02,519
Yeah, I cut you off, I'm sorry.

441
00:18:02,519 --> 00:18:04,775
(Hallease chuckles)
- Coffee.

442
00:18:04,775 --> 00:18:07,165
- When Jada talks about how they met,

443
00:18:07,165 --> 00:18:11,612
and how she had bought
a ranch in Baltimore.

444
00:18:11,612 --> 00:18:15,300
And then he called and was
like all slick about it.

445
00:18:15,300 --> 00:18:16,133
Well, you're seeing me now.

446
00:18:16,133 --> 00:18:18,870
And she was like, Okay,
and just flew right back.

447
00:18:18,870 --> 00:18:21,030
And never stepped foot on that ranch.

448
00:18:21,030 --> 00:18:24,040
And Willow talks and mentions
like, Oh, well you know

449
00:18:24,040 --> 00:18:26,400
I know that growing up with you now.

450
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:29,950
I know that life that
was something you wanted.

451
00:18:29,950 --> 00:18:31,880
And then she didn't pursue it.

452
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:33,692
And true, it's of her own,
she made a choice, right?

453
00:18:33,692 --> 00:18:35,899
We all make choices.

454
00:18:35,899 --> 00:18:38,620
But it for me it spoke to a certain level

455
00:18:38,620 --> 00:18:41,060
of how much women in general,

456
00:18:41,060 --> 00:18:44,370
especially once they get
married, feel this pressure,

457
00:18:44,370 --> 00:18:46,910
whether the spouse is actually
presenting that pressure

458
00:18:46,910 --> 00:18:51,910
to them or not, to bend and
lose a bit of themselves.

459
00:18:52,620 --> 00:18:54,630
- Homogenize to like, yeah.

460
00:18:54,630 --> 00:18:56,650
- Yeah, to lose a bit of themselves.

461
00:18:56,650 --> 00:18:59,540
'Cause I could see, you
know and she of course,

462
00:18:59,540 --> 00:19:02,240
you know, the beauty of time, right?

463
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:05,370
She's like, Well, yeah, I
lost it, but what did I gain?

464
00:19:05,370 --> 00:19:07,270
And of course, you know, her
daughter's sitting right there.

465
00:19:07,270 --> 00:19:09,643
And she is happy about that, and her son.

466
00:19:09,643 --> 00:19:12,920
But it is like, that was a life

467
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:14,570
you wanted for yourself, you know?

468
00:19:14,570 --> 00:19:16,370
- What's a good example of that

469
00:19:16,370 --> 00:19:19,200
is you possibly staying in L.A.--

470
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:20,950
- Mm-hm.

471
00:19:20,950 --> 00:19:23,798
- If you weren't married
or like in a relationship.

472
00:19:23,798 --> 00:19:27,050
And then also the last name thing.

473
00:19:27,050 --> 00:19:28,320
'Cause that bothered you, too.

474
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:30,496
- Dude, that bothered me a lot!

475
00:19:30,496 --> 00:19:31,329
- If you wanna talk
about those two things?

476
00:19:31,329 --> 00:19:33,177
- I think I even, if you go
back far enough on my channel,

477
00:19:33,177 --> 00:19:34,847
there's a video about it. (laughs)

478
00:19:34,847 --> 00:19:38,050
- Oh, you slammed me on the
channel way back when, cool.

479
00:19:38,050 --> 00:19:39,929
- I didn't slam you, I just--
- Link in the video above.

480
00:19:39,929 --> 00:19:43,946
- (laughs) Yeah, so, yeah.

481
00:19:43,946 --> 00:19:48,140
When I was in my undergraduate at UT,

482
00:19:48,140 --> 00:19:50,152
the whole entire reason I went to UT

483
00:19:50,152 --> 00:19:51,900
was for their film school.

484
00:19:51,900 --> 00:19:54,450
And the whole reason I went
to that specific film school

485
00:19:54,450 --> 00:19:57,625
was because they offered a
domestic study abroad program

486
00:19:57,625 --> 00:20:00,498
where you could fly to L.A.
and spend a semester in L.A.

487
00:20:00,498 --> 00:20:03,200
interning, learning the
business, and all that.

488
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:05,270
And the idea being that
like, ideally you'd do that

489
00:20:05,270 --> 00:20:08,280
as one of your last semesters
and you'd just stay out there.

490
00:20:08,280 --> 00:20:11,600
And you've spearheaded
yourself to start a career.

491
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:13,250
- This is the University of Texas,

492
00:20:13,250 --> 00:20:14,720
not the University of Tennessee.

493
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:15,870
- Sorry.
- The UT.

494
00:20:15,870 --> 00:20:19,159
- Sorry, the University
of Texas at Austin.

495
00:20:19,159 --> 00:20:19,992
- Right, the proper one.

496
00:20:19,992 --> 00:20:21,206
And then just start a
flame war with Tennessee.

497
00:20:21,206 --> 00:20:23,145
- (Hallease laughs) Stop it!

498
00:20:23,145 --> 00:20:28,145
So yeah, I had been studying
to do this UT L.A. program

499
00:20:28,204 --> 00:20:31,124
for a while and then I met you.

500
00:20:31,124 --> 00:20:36,124
And I remember that was
a point of (chuckles).

501
00:20:36,490 --> 00:20:39,810
I remember that was a point of
contention for us for a bit,

502
00:20:39,810 --> 00:20:44,490
was that I already, I remember
I let you know from the jump,

503
00:20:44,490 --> 00:20:46,200
like, I'm still going to L.A.

504
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:50,640
That's not, I'm not changing
that just because I met you.

505
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:52,710
Even though I love you very much

506
00:20:52,710 --> 00:20:55,282
and I want this relationship to work.

507
00:20:55,282 --> 00:20:56,810
I will be very, I know I will resent you

508
00:20:56,810 --> 00:20:59,777
if I don't go and try, you know?

509
00:20:59,777 --> 00:21:02,648
And you were not okay for,
I mean, you got over it.

510
00:21:02,648 --> 00:21:06,231
Leading up to me going, 'cause
it was like, I'm going, so.

511
00:21:06,231 --> 00:21:09,112
- And I don't necessarily know.

512
00:21:09,112 --> 00:21:12,600
So it wasn't you leaving that bothered me.

513
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:16,810
It was the prospect or the idea

514
00:21:16,810 --> 00:21:19,140
that you would not come back.

515
00:21:19,140 --> 00:21:21,310
Like you would go there
and either you would

516
00:21:21,310 --> 00:21:22,530
like fall in love with the city,

517
00:21:22,530 --> 00:21:23,810
fall in love with the culture,

518
00:21:23,810 --> 00:21:25,980
or like find a really good job.

519
00:21:25,980 --> 00:21:29,777
And then, like you would
not come back and so then.

520
00:21:29,777 --> 00:21:32,330
It got in my head, and there's like,

521
00:21:32,330 --> 00:21:34,803
Oh well, I don't need to stay here anyway.

522
00:21:34,803 --> 00:21:37,470
Like, I'll just move
over there if need be.

523
00:21:37,470 --> 00:21:38,720
- Right, yeah.

524
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:40,563
- But that also led me to proposing,

525
00:21:40,563 --> 00:21:44,150
which I still contend was not a trap.

526
00:21:44,150 --> 00:21:46,715
Like it was not me ensnaring you.

527
00:21:46,715 --> 00:21:51,676
I still say that I was just
showing you my commitment.

528
00:21:51,676 --> 00:21:53,690
(both laugh)

529
00:21:53,690 --> 00:21:56,183
I was just showing you
my commitment in that,

530
00:21:56,183 --> 00:21:58,567
it's like, I am serious
enough in this relationship

531
00:21:58,567 --> 00:22:01,976
that there is something for you here.

532
00:22:01,976 --> 00:22:04,608
Regardless of whether--
- Where here is?

533
00:22:04,608 --> 00:22:07,380
- Whether you're coming
back to San Antonio.

534
00:22:07,380 --> 00:22:09,210
Like, I am committed to you.

535
00:22:09,210 --> 00:22:10,460
So if you're gonna stay in L.A.,

536
00:22:10,460 --> 00:22:12,723
I will go to L.A. and find a job.

537
00:22:12,723 --> 00:22:16,859
And I believe that's what
I had told you on the phone

538
00:22:16,859 --> 00:22:18,318
at some point.

539
00:22:18,318 --> 00:22:19,151
- Right, it was.

540
00:22:20,527 --> 00:22:24,713
So fast forward, I went out
to L.A. already engaged.

541
00:22:26,510 --> 00:22:31,060
And so that definitely painted
a color of how I saw L.A.

542
00:22:31,060 --> 00:22:34,066
And you know, whether L.A.
had worked out or not,

543
00:22:34,066 --> 00:22:37,228
what I ended up coming back from that was,

544
00:22:37,228 --> 00:22:40,480
I do not regret going out there, you know.

545
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:42,710
I do not regret doing that for myself,

546
00:22:42,710 --> 00:22:44,940
'cause it was a vision I'd
had for myself before you.

547
00:22:44,940 --> 00:22:47,940
And it was something I
had worked so hard for

548
00:22:47,940 --> 00:22:49,970
to build towards myself.

549
00:22:49,970 --> 00:22:54,720
And for me it was, like, tying
it back to Will and Jada,

550
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:56,811
like knowing that Jada
never even got to experience

551
00:22:56,811 --> 00:22:59,430
that life for herself.

552
00:22:59,430 --> 00:23:01,940
And it was something that she obviously,

553
00:23:01,940 --> 00:23:03,870
actively wanted to pursue.

554
00:23:03,870 --> 00:23:05,750
Where it's like, you stopped acting.

555
00:23:05,750 --> 00:23:07,350
You made the money you wanted to make,

556
00:23:07,350 --> 00:23:10,160
stopped acting, and set yourself up

557
00:23:10,160 --> 00:23:11,910
to have the life you wanted.

558
00:23:11,910 --> 00:23:15,170
And you didn't even get
the opportunity to do that,

559
00:23:15,170 --> 00:23:17,325
of your own choice, but still.

560
00:23:17,325 --> 00:23:19,950
You missed it, you know what I mean?

561
00:23:19,950 --> 00:23:21,560
- Right, so she could've just said,

562
00:23:21,560 --> 00:23:24,277
Sure, but you're coming to me.
- Make it work.

563
00:23:24,277 --> 00:23:26,250
You're coming to me or we're gonna do

564
00:23:26,250 --> 00:23:28,940
some distance situation,
something, you know.

565
00:23:28,940 --> 00:23:31,314
- But they were both very young
in the relationship, anyway.

566
00:23:31,314 --> 00:23:32,940
- So were we, though.

567
00:23:32,940 --> 00:23:34,592
- Well yeah, but you do stupid things.

568
00:23:34,592 --> 00:23:35,685
- Well, yeah.

569
00:23:35,685 --> 00:23:37,380
- Well I'm not saying what
she did was stupid, but.

570
00:23:37,380 --> 00:23:38,927
I'm sure she might have
done things differently

571
00:23:38,927 --> 00:23:42,100
had it been Jada as she is now

572
00:23:42,100 --> 00:23:44,190
as opposed to Jada back when it happened.

573
00:23:44,190 --> 00:23:45,160
- Yeah, totally.

574
00:23:45,160 --> 00:23:47,580
So that was a bit that we,

575
00:23:47,580 --> 00:23:49,518
that was a stint that we went through,

576
00:23:49,518 --> 00:23:54,518
of one of us having
motivation and like dedication

577
00:23:54,890 --> 00:23:57,451
to an idea regardless of the other person

578
00:23:57,451 --> 00:23:59,960
that we wanted to pursue.

579
00:23:59,960 --> 00:24:02,871
And then also, yeah, when
we finally did get married,

580
00:24:02,871 --> 00:24:07,421
I definitely had like an
internal conflict with myself

581
00:24:07,421 --> 00:24:09,861
on the name change.

582
00:24:09,861 --> 00:24:14,014
Because I think a lot of it was because

583
00:24:14,014 --> 00:24:16,217
I had defined myself.

584
00:24:16,217 --> 00:24:21,217
I didn't realize how much I was...

585
00:24:23,220 --> 00:24:24,130
Like, just with the name change,

586
00:24:24,130 --> 00:24:27,050
how much you're forsaking your family.

587
00:24:27,050 --> 00:24:28,920
- Well, how much your
identity is tied to that.

588
00:24:28,920 --> 00:24:30,853
- Yeah, to your name, you know.

589
00:24:30,853 --> 00:24:32,930
- 'Cause you had brought up,

590
00:24:32,930 --> 00:24:34,865
well would you change your name?

591
00:24:34,865 --> 00:24:36,550
And I was protective of it, too.

592
00:24:36,550 --> 00:24:37,940
- Yeah, you were like, No!

593
00:24:37,940 --> 00:24:40,490
And I remember telling you, like--

594
00:24:40,490 --> 00:24:42,227
- What a part of the patriarchy, right?

595
00:24:42,227 --> 00:24:44,013
(both laugh)

596
00:24:44,013 --> 00:24:45,897
Idiot!
- Past you!

597
00:24:45,897 --> 00:24:50,210
Also and I remember
breaking it down to you.

598
00:24:50,210 --> 00:24:53,940
Like, yeah, I mean, you see
yourself as a Narvaez, right?

599
00:24:53,940 --> 00:24:55,820
It's like, I am a Clemons, though,

600
00:24:55,820 --> 00:24:59,010
that's not leaving me just
because I'm married to you.

601
00:24:59,010 --> 00:25:01,195
I'm still who I am.

602
00:25:01,195 --> 00:25:04,340
I don't wanna forsake my family.

603
00:25:04,340 --> 00:25:06,520
- Right, so would you?

604
00:25:06,520 --> 00:25:08,510
Okay, so what was the
compromise that you did?

605
00:25:08,510 --> 00:25:09,343
- So the compromise.

606
00:25:09,343 --> 00:25:11,240
Well it wasn't necessarily a compromise.

607
00:25:11,240 --> 00:25:12,810
It was just something
my mother told me to do

608
00:25:12,810 --> 00:25:15,776
because of the way Social Security works,

609
00:25:15,776 --> 00:25:17,600
which is very frustrating.

610
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:21,080
So my full name is technically,

611
00:25:21,080 --> 00:25:24,623
my last name is technically
Clemons Narvaez.

612
00:25:24,623 --> 00:25:25,550
- No hyphen.
- No hyphen,

613
00:25:25,550 --> 00:25:26,810
but there's a space.

614
00:25:26,810 --> 00:25:29,780
But that wasn't a compromise,

615
00:25:29,780 --> 00:25:32,627
that was a technicality. (laughs)

616
00:25:32,627 --> 00:25:35,190
- Oh, and so I'm sure that
I know that your opinion

617
00:25:35,190 --> 00:25:36,220
of it is still the same.

618
00:25:36,220 --> 00:25:39,453
Would you do the same thing
if you could do it over again?

619
00:25:41,500 --> 00:25:45,640
- Hindsight now, yes.

620
00:25:45,640 --> 00:25:47,172
- Oh you would still do it.

621
00:25:47,172 --> 00:25:48,005
- I would still do it.

622
00:25:48,005 --> 00:25:50,030
Only because--
- What?

623
00:25:50,030 --> 00:25:51,060
- I'm gonna explain why, though.

624
00:25:51,060 --> 00:25:53,584
Because from an artist perspective,

625
00:25:53,584 --> 00:25:57,569
Hallease Narvaez sounds
better than Hallease Clemons.

626
00:25:57,569 --> 00:26:01,860
That's it, that's the
only reason. (laughs)

627
00:26:01,860 --> 00:26:04,085
- If y'all are furrowing
your brow at home,

628
00:26:04,085 --> 00:26:05,981
I am doing the same thing.

629
00:26:05,981 --> 00:26:07,579
- I'm not gonna lie to you.

630
00:26:07,579 --> 00:26:10,320
Artistically, like as an artist.

631
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:12,361
So many artists change their names, right?

632
00:26:12,361 --> 00:26:15,060
- But I mean, if y'all
want a justification

633
00:26:15,060 --> 00:26:16,480
that Mr. Hallease is a monster,

634
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:19,537
I mean, I guess this episode is that.

635
00:26:19,537 --> 00:26:20,817
(Hallease laughs)

636
00:26:20,817 --> 00:26:22,460
That we were gonna put
that out for prosperity,

637
00:26:22,460 --> 00:26:24,910
or what do you call
it, is that prosperity?

638
00:26:24,910 --> 00:26:26,900
- But so here's another reason why though.

639
00:26:26,900 --> 00:26:27,733
- Now what's my (chuckles) sorry.

640
00:26:27,733 --> 00:26:29,940
- No but here's another reason why,

641
00:26:29,940 --> 00:26:32,360
if I could go back I wouldn't change--

642
00:26:32,360 --> 00:26:34,059
- Posterity!

643
00:26:34,059 --> 00:26:35,220
(both laugh)

644
00:26:35,220 --> 00:26:36,580
Doing something for posterity.

645
00:26:36,580 --> 00:26:38,868
It's gonna kill me,
someone's gonna correct me.

646
00:26:38,868 --> 00:26:40,460
They're like, No, stupid!

647
00:26:40,460 --> 00:26:41,791
You graduated from where?

648
00:26:41,791 --> 00:26:43,917
- Oh my God.
- Idiot!

649
00:26:46,047 --> 00:26:48,780
- But yeah, another reason
why if I could go back

650
00:26:48,780 --> 00:26:51,290
I would still keep it,

651
00:26:51,290 --> 00:26:54,122
is because I realized later on

652
00:26:54,122 --> 00:26:58,434
that having Hallease was my
way to still keep my identity

653
00:26:58,434 --> 00:27:02,400
but also acknowledge the commitment to you

654
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:03,373
that I had, too.

655
00:27:04,256 --> 00:27:05,514
- Honoring the past, but--

656
00:27:05,514 --> 00:27:06,820
- Honoring the past, but
acknowledging my new future.

657
00:27:06,820 --> 00:27:09,050
So Hallease, for those
of y'all who don't know,

658
00:27:09,050 --> 00:27:11,230
I go by my middle name, which is Hallease.

659
00:27:11,230 --> 00:27:15,093
And that's my grandmother,
I was named after her.

660
00:27:15,093 --> 00:27:20,093
And so, yeah, going by that
is like a way to always honor

661
00:27:20,370 --> 00:27:23,530
where I've come from and
maintain that identity.

662
00:27:23,530 --> 00:27:26,670
But and also recognize that I
am part of a different family

663
00:27:26,670 --> 00:27:28,620
too, now, Narvaez.

664
00:27:28,620 --> 00:27:29,490
And have that, too.

665
00:27:29,490 --> 00:27:33,110
So in hindsight, yeah, I would still

666
00:27:33,110 --> 00:27:36,754
go by Narvaez or whatever.

667
00:27:36,754 --> 00:27:37,866
- Excuse me?

668
00:27:37,866 --> 00:27:38,699
(Hallease chuckles)

669
00:27:38,699 --> 00:27:39,532
Or whatever.

670
00:27:39,532 --> 00:27:40,633
- Or whatever, yeah.

671
00:27:41,679 --> 00:27:44,870
But it's tough, man,
workin' through all that.

672
00:27:44,870 --> 00:27:46,140
From the feminine perspective.

673
00:27:46,140 --> 00:27:47,627
'Cause I mean like, you didn't
have to think about that.

674
00:27:47,627 --> 00:27:49,180
- That's the whole point
of getting married.

675
00:27:49,180 --> 00:27:54,180
It's just like this big
social show of force, that...

676
00:27:55,360 --> 00:27:57,830
Acknowledge before God
and all the other people

677
00:27:57,830 --> 00:28:00,163
who effectively are the
god in your community,

678
00:28:00,163 --> 00:28:02,500
and dictate who and what you are.

679
00:28:02,500 --> 00:28:04,810
- Ooh, gettin' deep.

680
00:28:04,810 --> 00:28:07,034
- Then it is known to them

681
00:28:07,034 --> 00:28:11,124
that you are now merged as one being.

682
00:28:11,124 --> 00:28:13,610
- One flesh.

683
00:28:13,610 --> 00:28:15,627
- If you try to break it apart,

684
00:28:15,627 --> 00:28:16,460
we still gonna talk behind your back.

685
00:28:16,460 --> 00:28:19,530
Oh, she was with that man, that nasty man

686
00:28:19,530 --> 00:28:22,790
that made her do things,
change her last name, ugh!

687
00:28:22,790 --> 00:28:24,631
- You had some difficulties
when I was entertaining

688
00:28:24,631 --> 00:28:26,630
the idea of not changing my name.

689
00:28:26,630 --> 00:28:29,070
- But I also, so you said
I didn't have to go through

690
00:28:29,070 --> 00:28:29,903
the same thing.

691
00:28:29,903 --> 00:28:32,610
But you had asked me
and like propositioned,

692
00:28:32,610 --> 00:28:35,600
if I would actually
legitimately change my name.

693
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:37,010
And so there was a couple days

694
00:28:37,010 --> 00:28:39,008
where I was actually thinking about it.

695
00:28:39,008 --> 00:28:40,930
Like, it wasn't the same level of distress

696
00:28:40,930 --> 00:28:42,850
that you went through.

697
00:28:42,850 --> 00:28:46,440
At least, like I'm not comparing it.

698
00:28:46,440 --> 00:28:48,380
- No, but.
- But internally, it was...

699
00:28:48,380 --> 00:28:50,130
- Yeah, you were like,
Oh, well damn. (laughs)

700
00:28:50,130 --> 00:28:53,927
- I mean, we had even
like thought about it,

701
00:28:53,927 --> 00:28:56,225
like what if we just changed
our names completely?

702
00:28:56,225 --> 00:28:59,373
- Yeah, didn't we entertain that?

703
00:28:59,373 --> 00:29:01,853
We were like, what if we just
came up with a new name then?

704
00:29:03,222 --> 00:29:04,370
Yeah, but then we were like,

705
00:29:04,370 --> 00:29:05,930
No, we're not ridiculous like that.

706
00:29:05,930 --> 00:29:08,120
We can't take it that
far, that's too much.

707
00:29:08,120 --> 00:29:09,480
- Well I mean it's like, it's two people

708
00:29:09,480 --> 00:29:11,980
coming together as one, so
like we could've done that.

709
00:29:11,980 --> 00:29:13,031
- We could've.

710
00:29:13,031 --> 00:29:17,346
Our families were already like,
these people are (laughs).

711
00:29:17,346 --> 00:29:18,992
- We eloped.

712
00:29:18,992 --> 00:29:21,320
- We were already a lot for
both sides of the family

713
00:29:21,320 --> 00:29:23,120
to deal with, we were
already a lot. (laughs)

714
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:24,697
- Whatever, man.

715
00:29:24,697 --> 00:29:25,530
- We didn't need to push it.

716
00:29:25,530 --> 00:29:26,587
- Leave and cleave.

717
00:29:26,587 --> 00:29:29,340
- (laughs) Check that episode out.

718
00:29:29,340 --> 00:29:31,170
- So, in summary.

719
00:29:31,170 --> 00:29:32,003
- In summary.

720
00:29:32,003 --> 00:29:33,632
- Mr. Hallease is a monster.

721
00:29:33,632 --> 00:29:34,960
(Hallease laughs)

722
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:39,960
Will Smith used his wife for
his own gain, I did, too.

723
00:29:40,015 --> 00:29:44,080
We're all flawed as far as men, and...

724
00:29:45,800 --> 00:29:48,480
- No, in summary.

725
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:51,674
In summary, it's hard. (laughs)

726
00:29:51,674 --> 00:29:55,372
In summary, you have outside forces.

727
00:29:55,372 --> 00:29:56,933
- And inside forces.
- In summary,

728
00:29:57,922 --> 00:29:58,940
and inside forces.

729
00:29:58,940 --> 00:30:00,465
Full circle.

730
00:30:00,465 --> 00:30:01,680
- That was my idea.

731
00:30:01,680 --> 00:30:03,710
- Yeah, well it's like, you have...

732
00:30:03,710 --> 00:30:04,993
No one's right,

733
00:30:05,960 --> 00:30:07,300
I think is what the summary is.

734
00:30:07,300 --> 00:30:08,967
- Is that just what we're gonna

735
00:30:08,967 --> 00:30:09,800
come to every single episode?

736
00:30:09,800 --> 00:30:11,300
- Well, it's just like you're just people.

737
00:30:11,300 --> 00:30:13,550
You're just trying to
figure it out, you know.

738
00:30:13,550 --> 00:30:16,150
And you have a lot of outside forces

739
00:30:16,150 --> 00:30:18,390
as far as like social
structures and things like that

740
00:30:18,390 --> 00:30:19,340
you have to deal with.

741
00:30:19,340 --> 00:30:21,775
And either you conform to them,

742
00:30:21,775 --> 00:30:26,203
or you make a concerted
effort to push past them.

743
00:30:27,510 --> 00:30:32,510
And much of our story is
pushing past them. (laughing)

744
00:30:32,525 --> 00:30:35,356
Sometimes begrudgingly.

745
00:30:35,356 --> 00:30:39,908
To me, at the epicenter of
what I feel like my job is

746
00:30:39,908 --> 00:30:41,560
as your wife...

747
00:30:42,920 --> 00:30:47,920
Is to help you to be the best
version of yourself, right.

748
00:30:48,023 --> 00:30:51,940
That's what I define being a wife as.

749
00:30:51,940 --> 00:30:53,490
Nothing else.

750
00:30:53,490 --> 00:30:54,590
- And I feel the same.

751
00:30:55,530 --> 00:30:59,420
- How do you define being a
partner in a relationship?

752
00:30:59,420 --> 00:31:01,099
What does that mean to you?

753
00:31:01,099 --> 00:31:02,330
- And think about the
influences that you have

754
00:31:02,330 --> 00:31:03,163
with other people.

755
00:31:03,163 --> 00:31:05,084
- Yeah, what do you
expect from your partner

756
00:31:05,084 --> 00:31:08,680
because of social constructs and culture.

757
00:31:08,680 --> 00:31:11,380
And are those things actually good,

758
00:31:11,380 --> 00:31:13,434
or do you think they might
be actually detrimental?

759
00:31:13,434 --> 00:31:15,920
But anyway, you know, for what it's worth,

760
00:31:15,920 --> 00:31:17,310
Will and Jada, thanks.

761
00:31:17,310 --> 00:31:18,650
We'll see y'all next week, bye!

762
00:31:18,650 --> 00:00:00,000
- Goodbye!
(Hallease laughs)
