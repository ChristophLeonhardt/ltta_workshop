wine lovers I think often like to open old wine I think it's really one of the interesting things that we get to explore but at the same time it's really difficult to open there's a tool called an osso you can google it it's a H - s oh and it's just a little two-pronged kind of handle that will slide down the side of a cork they're super inexpensive and it makes opening an old bottle of wine so much easier because you don't actually have to penetrate the cork you just go around it you usually don't break things that way there's a little bit more of an expensive version usually around a hundred dollars called adarand which is a corkscrew also combo which is really useful too if you want to splurge kind of a newer thing on the market is the core oven which I'm sure a lot of people have heard of which allows you to kind of drink part of a wine by accessing it through a needle and replacing the void with an inert gas argon and I think for preserving the wine for a week or two you really can have a wine be almost exact to the way it was when you opened it when you really test kind of great wines or older ones for a longer period there is a change there's definitely not the same thing as opening a fresh bottle and opening a bottle that had some of it taken out you know five months later it's not the same thing but it's still pretty close and I think that's a pretty interesting gift for a wine lover
