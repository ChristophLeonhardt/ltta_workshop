00:00:02,490 --> 00:00:05,130
descended into a subterranean passage by

3
00:00:05,130 --> 00:00:07,589
moving stairs there in an opening many

4
00:00:07,589 --> 00:00:09,840
many meters below the earth I stood with

5
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:12,480
my fellow humans we waited and time

6
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:14,670
granted us a cylindrical metal device

7
00:00:14,670 --> 00:00:17,160
with a great rule of Rushton and panels

8
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:19,439
<font color="#E5E5E5">on its side opened to let us in and that</font>

00:00:19,439 --> 00:00:21,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">I was out once inside one of the</font>

vertebrae of<font color="#E5E5E5"> this great beast and</font>

11
00:00:23,130 --> 00:00:25,199
leaning against the edge I watched his

people to count glass squares I to

13
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:30,150
barely thinking brought out my own and

14
00:00:30,150 --> 00:00:32,399
tapping the rectangular device caused it

15
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:33,809
to produce light through there<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

16
00:00:33,809 --> 00:00:35,550
connected to an invisible system

00:00:35,550 --> 00:00:37,559
accessible<font color="#E5E5E5"> even though it was so far</font>

00:00:37,559 --> 00:00:39,329
below<font color="#CCCCCC"> the ground it's a system that can</font>

19
00:00:39,329 --> 00:00:41,430
even<font color="#E5E5E5"> now be accessed from many many</font>

20
00:00:41,430 --> 00:00:43,559
kilometers above the ground when you're

21
00:00:43,559 --> 00:00:45,180
moving through space and<font color="#E5E5E5"> a tin of a</font>

different sort through it I've had

23
00:00:46,860 --> 00:00:48,960
several forms of entertainment keeping

24
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:51,090
up with and keeping updated those people

25
00:00:51,090 --> 00:00:52,980
i seed for a few days once a year

26
00:00:52,980 --> 00:00:54,840
keeping up<font color="#E5E5E5"> with those people who I never</font>

27

see and never know but<font color="#E5E5E5"> you still matter</font>

28
00:00:57,059 --> 00:00:58,620
because they still live here on this

29
00:00:58,620 --> 00:01:00,480
strange thing but nothing was quite so

30
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:02,129
<font color="#E5E5E5">entertaining as watching everyone else</font>

31
00:01:02,129 --> 00:01:04,080
as they were individually caught up in

32
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:05,970
their own little<font color="#E5E5E5"> universe staring at</font>

33
00:01:05,970 --> 00:01:08,250
glass panes of different sizes it was as

34
00:01:08,250 --> 00:01:09,990
I watched them that I realized this is

35
00:01:09,990 --> 00:01:11,970
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> future I've read about without even</font>

36
00:01:11,970 --> 00:01:13,979
noticing I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> already there and although</font>

we<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't live underwater too many</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">there I saw these people as characters</font>

43
00:01:26,189 --> 00:01:28,590
from the wasteland by TS Eliot with each

commutes but I still find it strangely

48
00:01:36,390 --> 00:01:38,310
comforting to know that the automation

51
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:44,490
developing new ways of looking at<font color="#CCCCCC"> our</font>

at once and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I sort of only just noticed</font>

00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:01,979
that would allow this film to be

screened in some big important cinemas
