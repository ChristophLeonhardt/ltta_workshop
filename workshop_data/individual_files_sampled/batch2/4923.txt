elie to you first you have watched this play out over the last four days what in the world do you make of it well it's just it's the typical chaos except it's about something it seems more grave than what we typically deal with at the White House there is a lot of confusion and and trying to figure out every time the president opens his mouth they have to backtrack it and so there is even with the president some understanding that what he did Monday did not work and they need it to do a walk back but you can see deep within the president's DNA his first answer is usually what he believes when he was put on the spot standing next to Putin Monday in Helsinki several times to to condemn what Putin did to accept it to blame him to tell him not to do it again he refused to do it almost sort of the childlike stubbornness that we see from this president who just refuses to follow what his advisers tell him to do doesn't want to be put in a box but when he sees the coverage so negative reflected back to him then he realizes okay we've got to walk this back but even that has seemed half-hearted a couple days ago saying well it was just this one double negative and that should clear it up and then he responds to in question yesterday and he says you know mouths know several times and then we're supposed to believe that he was just saying he didn't want to answer the question it's ludicrous and and this is the sort of back and forth that we see at the president the president wants to to be praised and and told he's doing the right thing and yet he can't get off this this thing that he has deep inside him where he just refuses to really be tough on Vladimir Putin it wasn't just this would-wouldn't double- controversy watch the entirety of president Trump's press conference with Vladimir Putin and to say well I just wanna spoke on this one point is utter nonsense Malcolm I want to play for you a bit more we showed it earlier about president what President Trump said about Vladimir Putin in his interview with Jeff Glor on CBS take a look if you believe US intelligence agencies is Putin lying to you I don't want to get into whether or not he's lying I can only say that I do have confidence in our intelligence agencies as currently constituted I think we have excellent people in the agencies and when they tell me something it means a lot okay do you think that gives Malcolm the intelligence community the assurance they need it was just a couple days ago that Dan coats without clearance from the White House reiterated his statement yes the lat the lights are blinking Russia is still trying to interfere well the US intelligence community is going to do their job day in and day out without any concern whether the president believes them or not their job is to produce information he's the consumer and you know there's that old saw you know that throughout the community that you can lead a consumer to intelligence but you can't make them think this president on the other hand absolutely flat-out does not believe anything that US intelligence says to him especially when it comes to him in some reform and it violates the meta-narrative that's in his head about how the world works and I have to tell you that meta-narrative is not intrinsic to Donald Trump that was put there by the Russians he has a dump in as far back as 2013 he has adopted their worldview and that's precisely what the Russians have always wanted and so now he defaults to their position because that's how he was grounded in foreign policy that narrative of Russia good their money good they want to be partners with him they will enrich him in some way and everybody else is out to get him it's going to be very difficult going forward with anything until this president either diss abuses himself of this this this opinion or until some action forces us to have a new administration okay but let's be honest he's never actually going to do that according to the New York Times before the inauguration in January of 2017 President Trump was alerted that it was Putin who personally pushed this to help with this cyber attack and still even with that interview mike lupica with Jeff Glor he says well seeing that he is that the head of that country I guess I hold him responsible I want to show what the cover of Time magazine looks like this week because it's chilling it's Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin's face mashed together and we could laugh and say it's creepy but how serious is it Stephanie here's how you know that he said what he thought the other day in Helsinki because when he went to his sanitation engineers at Fox he didn't think he had to do any cleaning up okay and and and so what you're watching now like at the next Winter Olympics they're gonna name figure skating moves after everything this president has done over the last three or four days and and this thing of The Times story today I was talking to a Republican senator a month after Donald Trump got elected and he said I have to tell you there's a lot of Russia stuff banging around this town right now and even in the intelligence briefings he'd already had this senator said when the subject of Russia comes up he doesn't want to talk about it it's not just Republican senators I've I have spoken to people inside the White House former administration members who have said the moment Russia or president Trump's taxes enter the conversation the wheels come off he does not want to touch it Eli I want to share what President Trump said he did behind closed doors of Putin because remember they had a meeting for over two and a half hours and we have no idea what was said in there the important thing frankly was the meeting that lasted for two and a half hours or almost two and a half hours and in that meeting we discussed many many things that were very very positive for both countries what tangibly emerged from that conversation what what do you feel you achieved I think we achieved a lot things emerged that were very important okay things that were very important he hasn't told them hold us what they are yet Russia is leading us to believe some sort of verbal agreements were struck as it relates to our military and it sounds as though the State Department is trying to figure out what that is what do you make of this Malcolm well you know there whatever happened in that meeting Donald Trump thinks it's an agreement the Russians have printed the stay after word that there was a series of agreements on strategic cooperation between the Defense Department and their Russian Ministry of Defence supposedly something related to this the START treaty the strategic nuclear arms reduction treaty and relationships between the United States that are remain unspoken no one knows anything about that except Donald Trump and the Russians and if he cut a deal with them that no one else knows about they're gonna shove that down our throats let me tell you I'm one of the first people in former US intelligence that has actually come out and said Donald Trump has been co-opted by the Russians and everything that happened in Helsinki after Helsinki and technically over the last few years has just done nothing but solidify that I think he works in the interest of Russia because to him he thinks they are his base and that it will benefit them and the same way that he thinks that the Republican Party and the people that voted for so he's never going to cross them and he whatever deal he made is going to become a tyrant very fast do you think his base cares if President Trump actually took the stance and said so what Vladimir Putin and Russia helped us defeat Hillary Clinton isn't that what you wanted how do you think president Trump's base would take that Eli well I mean just based on the the reader feedback that I get this week from a lot of Trump supporters they don't want to hear anything other than what Trump is saying which is that he's improving relationships with Russia and that we're out to get him by criticize her pointing out things that he says that seem counter to American national security interests and so that is sort of where the Trump base is even on this eve although though the difference I suppose is that we've seen Republicans in Congress react to this and come back at the president in a in a much tougher way than we've seen them do really on anything else whether that amounts to anything beyond rhetoric so far we'll we'll see but as far as the Trump voter heart exactly define who that is but I would say at this point they're not too fazed by what happened on Monday we go all week long you have been talking about how he has elevated this hoodlum okay and and with an economy that's what the xxx xxx largest trading partner okay thank Chile and UAE except there is a lot of gas lighting that goes on all the time between this president and his base but the worst that is going on this week in the shadow of Helsinki is that Putin isn't that bad and guess what he is okay Malcolm I turn to you on this then one of the things they could have discussed in that closed-door meeting is the idea that robert muller could interview the russians indicted in exchange for russia being able to interview americans like former ambassador michael mcfaul i want to share what sarah Sanders said about that there was some conversation about it but there wasn't a commitment made on behalf of the United States and the president will work with his team and will let you know if there's an announcement on that front okay and I want to share what former Secretary of State John Kerry tweeted after that the administration needs to make it unequivocally clear that in a million years this would not be under consideration . . not something that should require half a second of consultation dangerous malcolm well let me use a technical intelligence term to describe my opinion about that this is crazy okay you are we do not suborn the justice department of the united states to a hostile powers act you know their their prosecutorial office which took part in a crime attacking the united states trying to distribute dirty-tricks information hacking into a political party and trying to fundamentally break down the establishment of the the base fundamentals of the American electoral process we don't do that and George Washington John Jay all the ghosts of our founding fathers are spinning in their graves Donald Trump does not know what he's talking about because in the presence of Vladimir Putin for some bizarre strange reason he seems to become a supine puppy and just go along with ever ridiculous idea that he has he does not and did not speak for the United States at that conference and people need to hold him accountable well it's a bizarre strange reason or maybe it isn't Michael you know it's funny he responded to the reaction about him when when he was coming back but what about the reaction to the shameful idea that Michael McFaul who served this country would ever have to go over and be interviewed by the agents for a whole diplomatic community our State Department no and you wonder how what the reaction would be from this White House if McFaul was someone who had been nice to this president who had been complimentary to
