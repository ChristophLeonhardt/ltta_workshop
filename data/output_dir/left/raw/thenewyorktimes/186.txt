1
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:07,652
Four more meals left,
and I’m out of the hole.

2
00:01:07,652 --> 00:01:09,510
Can’t sleep the night before.

3
00:01:13,540 --> 00:01:15,280
Waiting, waiting.

4
00:01:17,610 --> 00:01:19,120
Oh my God, waiting.

5
00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:25,670
Trying not to jones out.

6
00:01:25,670 --> 00:01:31,380
Knowing it’s coming, but
wishing it was faster.

7
00:01:31,380 --> 00:01:35,310
It’s finally here, and
I start the ritual.

8
00:01:35,310 --> 00:01:40,840
I load it up … and shove it in.

9
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:44,710
Draw back. Make sure you don’t
miss because it’ll hurt.

10
00:01:47,300 --> 00:01:51,530
Sending it. Feeling the rush.

11
00:01:51,530 --> 00:01:57,270
Every hair stands up,
and you start sweating.

12
00:01:57,270 --> 00:02:00,280
Getting that cough.
Huh!

13
00:02:01,190 --> 00:02:03,780
That’s the best part.

14
00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:06,642
Starting to spin.

15
00:02:08,270 --> 00:02:11,012
Out of control.

16
00:02:33,690 --> 00:02:36,294
Like, we have 
one chance. Like …

17
00:02:36,294 --> 00:02:38,420
one chance to get the girls back.
That’s it, John.

18
00:02:38,420 --> 00:02:40,012
That is it.

19
00:02:40,012 --> 00:02:42,672
And if we fuck up, we
don’t get them back.

20
00:02:42,672 --> 00:02:43,897
I'm not going to —

21
00:02:43,907 --> 00:02:45,470
They’re going up for
fucking adoption.

22
00:02:45,470 --> 00:02:46,750
My sister’s going
to raise those kids.

23
00:02:46,750 --> 00:02:48,220
Your uncle’s going
to raise those girls.

24
00:02:48,220 --> 00:02:49,460
No, it ain’t going to
happen like that, because

25
00:02:49,460 --> 00:02:51,033
I am going to fucking
straighten out,

26
00:02:51,033 --> 00:02:52,489
and I’m going to smarten up.

27
00:02:54,970 --> 00:02:57,710
I’m not going to let
that happen, Saundra.

28
00:02:57,710 --> 00:03:02,082
If I have to go to a fucking
six-month rehab to get our girls back …

29
00:03:02,082 --> 00:03:03,520
I will.

30
00:03:21,690 --> 00:03:24,870
[police dispatcher] There’s a vehicle 
almost going into the ditch.

31
00:03:30,098 --> 00:03:31,568
[radio chatter]

32
00:03:53,292 --> 00:03:54,467
I don’t know.

33
00:03:54,467 --> 00:03:55,925
I’ve seen police,
and I always feel

34
00:03:55,925 --> 00:03:56,830
like they’re looking at me.

35
00:03:56,830 --> 00:03:59,074
I always feel like everyone’s
looking at me, really.

36
00:04:02,420 --> 00:04:05,130
I know.

37
00:04:06,999 --> 00:04:08,540
No, but it just
seems like every time

38
00:04:08,540 --> 00:04:10,090
I see a cop drive by me, right?

39
00:04:10,090 --> 00:04:12,014
That’s a cop right there.

40
00:04:14,836 --> 00:04:20,911
(SINGING) Sometimes I feel
like I don’t have a partner.

41
00:04:20,911 --> 00:04:29,893
Sometimes I feel like my only
friend is the city I live in.

42
00:05:45,802 --> 00:05:47,260
So first of all,
how are you doing?

43
00:05:47,260 --> 00:05:47,760
No.

44
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:49,145
No?
— No.

45
00:05:49,145 --> 00:05:50,045
Still struggling?

46
00:05:50,045 --> 00:05:53,313
Yeah, I’ve been not really
having a place to stay.

47
00:05:53,313 --> 00:05:55,890
Yeah, that makes things
even harder, right?

48
00:05:55,890 --> 00:06:00,600
Yeah, I know that I’m going
to ever stop until I want to.

49
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:02,340
Or until you’re stopped, right?

50
00:06:02,340 --> 00:06:03,390
Right.

51
00:06:03,390 --> 00:06:05,403
Honestly, what changed
it all is — that.

52
00:06:05,403 --> 00:06:08,360
When I started doing it,
that changed everything.

53
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:10,000
Right, that’s a game
changer in itself.

54
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,020
Absolutely.

55
00:06:11,020 --> 00:06:13,690
Ultimately, you know it’s
not going to end up anywhere good.

56
00:06:13,690 --> 00:06:16,670
Right, and I’ve never been to
rehab or anything like that before.

57
00:06:16,670 --> 00:06:19,960
The only time I’ve
kicked is, you know …

58
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:22,390
I have done it on
the streets on my own.

59
00:06:22,390 --> 00:06:23,230
Right.

60
00:06:23,230 --> 00:06:25,840
But it never lasted for too
long, maybe two months,

61
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:26,850
two and half months.

62
00:06:26,850 --> 00:06:28,750
But jail is the
only way it’s ever

63
00:06:28,750 --> 00:06:30,580
really stopped for a while.

64
00:06:30,580 --> 00:06:32,850
And the other thing
is too, though, is

65
00:06:32,850 --> 00:06:37,210
being stuck in that cycle of,
like, being on the streets.

66
00:06:37,210 --> 00:06:38,410
You know everybody in town.

67
00:06:38,410 --> 00:06:41,060
You’ve been around this town
your whole life, so it’s like —

68
00:06:41,060 --> 00:06:42,280
And you have a reputat —

69
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:44,190
people expect certain
things from you.

70
00:06:44,190 --> 00:06:46,690
Right, people are coming
to you looking for stuff,

71
00:06:46,690 --> 00:06:48,190
or you’re seeing them.

72
00:06:48,190 --> 00:06:49,850
And you know they have stuff.

73
00:06:49,850 --> 00:06:50,980
Right.

74
00:06:50,980 --> 00:06:52,885
The chances of
staying clean are —

75
00:06:52,885 --> 00:06:53,950
Slim to none.

76
00:06:57,270 --> 00:06:58,593
Can you see me now?

77
00:06:58,593 --> 00:06:59,520
Hi.

78
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:01,550
Hi, baby.

79
00:07:01,550 --> 00:07:04,870
I miss you.

80
00:07:04,870 --> 00:07:05,870
Hey, baby.

81
00:07:05,870 --> 00:07:07,384
You are getting so big.

82
00:07:10,290 --> 00:07:11,810
I love you.

83
00:07:11,810 --> 00:07:12,310
Hi.

84
00:07:12,310 --> 00:07:14,030
Hi, chunker munkers.

85
00:07:14,030 --> 00:07:15,735
I love you.

86
00:07:15,735 --> 00:07:17,475
See how excited she is?

87
00:07:17,475 --> 00:07:19,946
She doesn’t look as
excited to see me.

88
00:07:19,946 --> 00:07:20,840
Daddy.

89
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:23,100
Hi, baby girl.

90
00:07:23,100 --> 00:07:24,710
I miss you so much.

91
00:07:29,690 --> 00:07:30,550
She’s so excited.

92
00:07:30,550 --> 00:07:32,570
Hey, sweetie.

93
00:07:32,570 --> 00:07:33,450
We love you.

94
00:07:33,450 --> 00:07:34,770
What?

95
00:07:34,770 --> 00:07:35,700
What?

96
00:07:35,700 --> 00:07:37,605
Love you.

97
00:07:37,605 --> 00:07:39,000
Love you too.

98
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:39,980
I love you, Bella.

99
00:07:39,980 --> 00:07:41,453
I see you tomorrow, O.K.?

100
00:07:41,453 --> 00:07:42,703
Together forever, never apart.

101
00:07:42,703 --> 00:07:44,993
Maybe in distance,
but never in heart.

102
00:07:44,993 --> 00:07:46,590
That’s right, baby.

103
00:07:46,590 --> 00:07:48,960
Together forever, never apart.

104
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:52,580
Maybe in distance,
but never in heart.

105
00:07:52,580 --> 00:07:55,620
Because you’re in
my heart always.

106
00:07:55,620 --> 00:07:56,570
Careful, honey.

107
00:07:56,570 --> 00:07:58,530
I just did a handstand.

108
00:07:58,530 --> 00:07:59,245
No way.

109
00:07:59,245 --> 00:08:02,350
It’s because you’re so talented.

110
00:08:02,350 --> 00:08:03,390
Hey, I love you, baby.

111
00:08:05,910 --> 00:08:07,530
I love you.

112
00:08:07,530 --> 00:08:08,070
I love you.

113
00:08:08,070 --> 00:08:11,640
I’ll see you tomorrow, O.K.?

114
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:12,441
O.K.?

115
00:08:12,441 --> 00:08:12,940
O.K.

116
00:08:12,940 --> 00:08:13,260
I love you.

117
00:08:13,260 --> 00:08:13,920
Love you, baby.

118
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:16,341
Sweet dreams.

119
00:08:16,341 --> 00:08:20,730
(SINGING) Anything you can
do, I can do better.

120
00:08:20,730 --> 00:08:23,050
Anything you can
do, I can do better.

121
00:08:23,050 --> 00:08:27,260
I can do anything
better than you.

122
00:08:27,260 --> 00:08:29,530
No, you can’t.

123
00:08:29,530 --> 00:08:30,390
Yes, I can.

124
00:08:30,390 --> 00:08:32,549
Anything you can do,
I can do greater.

125
00:08:32,549 --> 00:08:37,438
Anything you — wait,
how did it go again?

126
00:08:42,850 --> 00:08:47,500
(SINGING) And I never liked
to admit that I was wrong.

127
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:52,206
I’ve been so caught in my job,
didn’t see what’s going on.

128
00:08:52,206 --> 00:08:57,684
But now I know, I’m better
sleeping on my own.

129
00:08:57,684 --> 00:09:02,596
'Cause if you like that way you
look that much, oh baby,

130
00:09:02,596 --> 00:09:04,588
you should go and fuck yourself.

131
00:09:04,588 --> 00:09:07,576
I will. I do.

132
00:09:07,576 --> 00:09:09,070
What?

133
00:09:09,070 --> 00:09:11,060
You will and what?

134
00:09:11,060 --> 00:09:12,160
I do.

135
00:09:14,548 --> 00:09:15,644
It’s great.

136
00:10:35,915 --> 00:10:41,300
[phone ringing]

137
00:10:49,850 --> 00:10:52,760
Hey, John, it’s Phil
from Navigating Recovery.

138
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:53,620
I’m calling, man.

139
00:10:53,620 --> 00:10:56,920
I haven’t heard from you
or seen you recently.

140
00:10:56,920 --> 00:11:01,060
And I was hoping that we
could get together soon

141
00:11:01,060 --> 00:11:04,840
and work on a plan to
help you out here, man.

142
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:05,840
Give us a call.

143
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:06,562
All right, John.

144
00:11:06,562 --> 00:11:08,480
Take care, buddy.
Bye.

145
00:12:51,220 --> 00:12:53,813
I’m here for you, O.K.?

146
00:12:53,813 --> 00:12:57,000
You got to take care of you
before you can take care of —

147
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,820
I know the way the
heart wants to go, O.K.?

148
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:01,010
Follow it, O.K.?

149
00:13:01,010 --> 00:13:02,760
Follow it.

150
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:04,160
Why, why, why, why?

151
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:06,130
You know why, O.K.?

152
00:13:06,130 --> 00:13:09,160
You know why, and you can
take care of yourself.

153
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:10,606
Fucked up, fucked up, fuck up.

154
00:13:10,606 --> 00:13:12,710
O.K., and all those kids
ain’t going to fucking

155
00:13:12,710 --> 00:13:14,609
remember a goddamn thing, O.K.?

156
00:13:14,609 --> 00:13:16,540
And they’ll love that guy, and you
can be that daddy that you are,

157
00:13:16,540 --> 00:13:17,590
and that husband.

158
00:13:17,590 --> 00:13:19,150
She loves you to
death, and I don’t

159
00:13:19,150 --> 00:13:20,800
think you should
cheat them like that.

160
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:22,591
You know, you’re cheating
them out of you, O.K.?

161
00:13:22,591 --> 00:13:24,674
Because “you” is a good person.

162
00:13:24,674 --> 00:13:25,640
O.K.?

163
00:13:25,640 --> 00:13:30,560
(OVER RADIO) He is suspended
and on probation.

164
00:13:30,810 --> 00:13:31,650
I’m trying.

165
00:13:31,650 --> 00:13:33,611
It’s just hard.

166
00:13:33,611 --> 00:13:35,110
People take one
look at me, and they

167
00:13:35,110 --> 00:13:37,690
think they know everything.

168
00:13:37,690 --> 00:13:40,950
Just because I know what I
look like, and it’s not fair.

169
00:13:40,950 --> 00:13:43,190
And I try to be
understanding and patient.

170
00:13:43,190 --> 00:13:49,300
But … I’m a human being, too.

171
00:13:49,300 --> 00:13:50,674
People don’t know me.

172
00:13:51,444 --> 00:13:54,940
When was the last time you used?

173
00:13:54,940 --> 00:13:56,405
A few days ago.
— A few days ago?

174
00:13:56,405 --> 00:13:57,170
Yeah.

175
00:13:57,170 --> 00:13:58,540
Are you O.K.?

176
00:13:58,540 --> 00:14:00,354
Yeah, I just don’t
want to do it anymore.

177
00:14:00,354 --> 00:14:01,472
Did you get sick?

178
00:14:03,780 --> 00:14:09,320
Yeah, I mean it’s like …
at that point,

179
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:13,300
when I need some place to
sleep, or some place

180
00:14:13,300 --> 00:14:15,300
to take a shower, or something.

181
00:14:15,300 --> 00:14:19,220
It’s like I’m going
to go somewhere,

182
00:14:19,220 --> 00:14:22,320
and any place I go, people use.
And they …

183
00:14:24,484 --> 00:14:26,860
It’s like fucked up.

184
00:14:26,860 --> 00:14:29,140
In my life, like a
way of showing love

185
00:14:29,140 --> 00:14:31,895
is by giving something
that destroys them.

186
00:14:31,895 --> 00:14:32,770
You know what I mean?

187
00:14:32,770 --> 00:14:36,679
Like, that’s how you show love.

188
00:14:36,679 --> 00:14:38,290
And to the rest of society,
and the rest of the world,

189
00:14:38,290 --> 00:14:40,172
it’s like, “What the fuck?”

190
00:14:47,090 --> 00:14:51,170
(OVER TELEPHONE) Hey, John.
Phil from Navigating Recovery.

191
00:14:51,175 --> 00:14:54,890
Man, I’m just starting to get
worried about your situation.

192
00:14:54,890 --> 00:14:59,090
You know, I know that your
probation officer, Trish,

193
00:14:59,090 --> 00:15:01,570
is getting to the end
of her rope,

194
00:15:01,570 --> 00:15:03,870
and I don’t want to see her
send you back to jail.

195
00:15:03,870 --> 00:15:07,250
So if you get this message,
man, give me a call.

196
00:15:07,250 --> 00:15:11,120
I’m still here to help you,
and I’d really like to do that.

197
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:12,710
So give me a call, man.

198
00:15:12,710 --> 00:15:13,820
All right, take care.

199
00:15:13,820 --> 00:15:15,470
Bye.

200
00:15:15,470 --> 00:15:15,970
Every time.

201
00:15:15,970 --> 00:15:20,180
Is that what I do
when I get high, too?

202
00:15:20,180 --> 00:15:21,855
Hey, crazy lady.

203
00:15:21,855 --> 00:15:24,780
You all right?

204
00:15:24,780 --> 00:15:26,280
I just want to get out of here.

205
00:15:26,280 --> 00:15:27,160
Just on your face.

206
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:29,888
Put some in your hands,
and splash it on your face.

207
00:15:45,510 --> 00:15:51,220
So like, getting out hopeful …
and finding nothing.

208
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:59,785
Trying hard … 
but there’s no support.

209
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:07,182
I seek … success

210
00:16:07,182 --> 00:16:09,712
but I find destruction.

211
00:16:11,950 --> 00:00:00,000
Oblivion awaits.
