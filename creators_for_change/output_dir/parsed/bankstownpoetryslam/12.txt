basically about my father he passed away
when I was 50 so it was kind of like him
not being able to sing God and whenever
the poem is missing grits over the days
that Noah now he longed to see his
little girl spark a feat of you for if
his days could see rays of song the
plants would not go as the ring would
see me for tree branches would watch me
break and like the vouchers I'd scream
the call from this nightmare I'd never
wake I hope he's resting peacefully
among the little brown soil without his
loving affection my Hanuman
