GRIFF: PRESIDENT TRUMP
ORDERING ONE MORE
INVESTIGATION OF JUDGE BRETT
KAVANAUGH AND STANDING
BEHIND HIS SUPREME COURT
NOMINEE.
THE PRESIDENT TWEETING
YESTERDAY:  JUST STARTED
TONIGHT OUR SEVENTH FBI
INVESTIGATION OF JUDGE BRETT
KAVANAUGH.
HE WILL SOME DAY BE
RECOGNIZED AS A TRULY GREAT
JUSTICE OF THE UNITED STATES
SUPREME COURT.
SO WHAT HAPPENS NEXT?
HERE TO WEIGH IN IS
LOUISIANA'S CONGRESSMAN BILL
CASSIDY.
GOOD MORNING, SIR, HOW ARE
YOU?
>> GOOD MORNING.
HOW ARE YOU?
>> GOOD.
SO, WHAT HAPPENS NEXT?
WALK ME THROUGH IT.
>> YEAH.
CLEARLY THERE WILL BE AN FBI
INVESTIGATION.
PRESUMABLY THEY HAVE SEVEN
DAYS, THIS IS DAY ONE.
IF YOU WILL, THIS IS PART OF
A BROADER DEMOCRATIC
STRATEGY TO COORDINATE IN
THAT COORDINATION TO SEEK TO
DELAY.
HOW MANY MORE CHARGES CAN BE
BROUGHT OUT TO SMEAR THIS
MAN TO CREATE LEGITIMATE
DOUBTS IN THE MINDS OF SOME,
THE AMERICAN PUBLIC.
IT'S A TACTIC OF ACCORD
NATION LEADING TO THE DELAY.
THERE IS OTHER THINGS THE
FBI SHOULD DO BUT IT SHOULD
INVESTIGATE WHETHER, INDEED,
THERE IS THIS INTENT TO
COORDINATE, IN FACT, THE
ACTUAL COORDINATION.
>> THAT'S A GREAT POINT YOU
BRING OUT.
DO YOU BELIEVE THAT THE FBI
SHOULD INVESTIGATE WHO
LEAKED DR. FORD'S LETTER?
YOUR COLLEAGUE, SENATOR
CORNYN CALLING OUT RANKING
MEMBER DIANNE FEINSTEIN
ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT HER
OFFICE LEAKED IT SHOULD THAT
BE LOOKED INTO WHO LEAKED
DR. FORD'S LETTER?
>> THERE IS AT LEAST TWO
SENATORS THAT CHALLENGE
JUDGE KAVANAUGH'S ASSERTION
THAT THIS IS PART OF A
COORDINATED EFFORT, TWO.
NOW, IF THEY ARE TRYING TO
CAST DOUBTS UPON HIS
JUDGMENT, I ACTUALLY THINK
HE SHOWED INSIGHT.
LET'S ACTUALLY INVESTIGATE.
ASK DIANNE FEINSTEIN UNDER
OATH DID SHE LEAK IT AND
THEN ASK HER A, BY THE WAY,
WE SHOULD ALSO SEEK TO GET
THE -- DR. FORD'S THERAPIST
RECORDS.
IT SHOULD BE LOOKED AT WITH
COMPASSION.
NOT RELEASED TO THE PUBLIC.
THERE SHOULD BE SOMEBODY WHO
KNOWS WHAT THEY ARE LOOKING
AT WHEN THEY SEE THERAPY
NOTES.
BUT THAT'S ALL SHE HAS
OFFERED FOR CORROBORATION.
THAT SHOULD ALSO BE LOOKED
AT TO SEE IF IT TRULY DOES
CORROBORATE.
BECAUSE THAT'S ALL THAT HAS
BEEN OFFERED BY HER SIDE.
AND THEN LOOK AT THIS
PATTERN OF DELAY,
COORDINATION, AND
OBFUSCATION.
GRIFF: SENATOR, HOW WILL
YOUR COLLEAGUES ON THE OTHER
SIDE WHO HAVE PLAYED
POLITICS ALL ALONG AS MANY
HAVE SUGGESTED, HOW WILL
THAT AFFECT IN ULTIMATE VOTE
FOR JUDGE KAVANAUGH?
>> YEAH.
I THINK THAT -- I THINK MOST
PEOPLE ON THE REPUBLICAN
SIDE SEE IT FOR WHAT IT'S
WORTH.
IT IS A PATTERN OF LEAKS,
SET TO DELAY AND TO
CHARACTER ASSASSINATE.
THINGS BEING RELEASED THAT
SHOULD NOT BE PUBLISHED
BECAUSE THERE IS NO SUPPORT
FOR THEM.
BUT, BECAUSE IT'S RELEASED.
IT FEEDS INTO THE DELAY.
>> I JUST WANT TO PRESSURE
YOU A LITTLE BIT BECAUSE
WHAT YOUR COLLEAGUE SENATOR
LINDSEY GRAHAM DID WAS TO
TRULY REACH ACROSS PARTISAN
ISLES, IF YOU WILL, TO SAY
LOOK AT WHAT WE ARE DOING.
WE ARE BETTER THAN THIS, IF
THIS INVESTIGATION DOES
PROVE THAT THE POLITICS ARE
BEING PLAYED ON THE
DEMOCRATIC SIDE, SHOULD WE
THEN SEE SOMETHING OUT OF
THEM?
>> YEAH, HOPEFULLY.
I HOPE.
I HOPE TRUTH IS MORE
IMPORTANT THAN CHARACTER
ASSASSINATION.
AN IDEOLOGY.
IT WON'T BE FOR SOME.
FOR SOME OTHERS, I HOPE THAT
IT WILL BE.
AND WE SHOULD NOT SET A
STANDARD THAT YOU CAN DO
CHARACTER ASSASSINATION,
KIND OF A COORDINATED
PATTERN OF IT TO BRING
SOMEBODY DOWN THAT IS A
DANGEROUS PLACE FOR OUR
SOCIETY TO MOVE INTO.
KIND OF LIKE THE BOOK 1984.
GRIFF: SENATOR BILL CASSIDY,
THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR
TIME.
