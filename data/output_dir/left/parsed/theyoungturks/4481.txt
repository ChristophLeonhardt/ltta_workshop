NEW PARENTS ARE TRYING OUT THE
LATEST TREND IN HAVING BABIES.
THEY ARE DOING SOMETHING KNOWN
AS LOTUS BIRTH, WHERE THEY KEEP
THE PLACENTA ATTACHED TO THE
BABY FOR A LONGER PERIOD OF
TIME, SOMETIMES DAYS,
AND THE WHOLE IDEA OF THIS IS
THAT IT HELPS IMPROVE THE BABY'S
IMMUNE SYSTEM, AND HAS ALL SORTS
OF POSITIVE PHYSICAL BENEFITS.
NOW, ACCORDING TO ATTENTION,
THERE'S A RAPIDLY GROWING TREND
AMONG NEW BIRTH PARENTS, WHERE
THEY ARE DELAYING THE COURT
CUTTING FOR DAYS, ALLOWING THE
PLACENTA TO DETACH ON ITS OWN.
SO, WHAT USUALLY HAPPENS IS
A NERVOUS FATHER COMES IN AND
CUT THE UMBILICAL CORD, BUT IN
THIS CASE THIS DOES NOT HAPPEN.
ACCORDING TO THOSE WHO PRACTICE
AND ADVOCATE FOR IT, LOTUS BIRTH
FACILITATES AN INTENSE BOND
BETWEEN MOTHER AND CHILD; IT'S
ALSO CLAIMED TO HELP BABIES
BITE OFF INFECTIONS,
SEVERE JAUNDICE, AND IMMUNE
SYSTEM DISEASES BY KEEPING
THE BABY ATTACHED TO THE
MOTHER'S BLOOD.
HOWEVER, THERE ARE A NUMBER
OF GYNECOLOGISTS SPEAKING
OUT AGAINST IT,
AND THEY SAY THAT THIS ACTUALLY
INCREASES THE CHANCE OF
INFECTION.
AMY TUTOR, A GYNECOLOGIST WHO
BLOGS AS SKEPTICAL OB, CALLS
LOTUS BIRTH A BIZARRE PRACTICE
WITH NO MEDICAL BENEFIT AND
CONSIDERABLE RISK, PARTICULARLY
MASSIVE INFECTION, AND A STUDY
IN 2016 FOUND AT LEAST ONE LOTUS
BIRTH BABY HAD TO BE READMITTED
TO THE HOSPITAL AFTER HER LIVER
EXPERIENCED SOME PROBLEMS.
SO, I AM THE MOST OPEN-MINDED
MAN IN AMERICA, EVERYBODY
KNOWS THIS.
DEFINITELY.
WHEN IT COMES TO HOUSING OR
UNDEREMPLOYMENT, BUT
ANYWAY, LET'S MOVE ON.
SO, AS I WAS READING THIS STORY
I THOUGHT, WELL, LOOK, HAVING
CONNECTION TO THE MOTHER'S
BLOOD, THERE'S A REASON WHY YOU
HAVE THE PLACENTA INSIDE THE
WOMB IN THE FIRST PLACE,
THERE COULD BE SOME LOGIC TO
THAT.
BUT I THOUGHT, COUPLE DAYS?
THAT DOESN'T SEEM RIGHT.
AND THEN, ONE WOMAN SAID THAT,
IRON AND STEM CELLS ARE
DELIVERED TO THE BABIES STORES.
I DON'T KNOW IF THAT'S AN
ENGLISH VERNACULAR, I DON'T KNOW
WHAT STORES ARE, BUT THAT'S OKAY
I'M PROBABLY IGNORANT ON THAT.
BUT I WAS LIKE, DELIVERING
IRON AND STEM CELLS, MAYBE,
MAYBE, BUT THREE DAYS IN?
PROBABLY NOT.
AND THEN THEY SAID, OH IT ALSO
HAS METAPHYSICAL BENEFITS, AND I
WAS LIKE, I'M OUT.
THIS IS NONSENSE, TOTAL GARBAGE,
THERE'S NO WAY.
BUT EVEN THEN, THE GYNECOLOGIST
THAT YOU QUOTED, ANA, SAID THAT,
FOR A COUPLE HOURS THERE IS SOME
LOGIC IN KEEPING THE PLACENTA,
EVEN THOUGH IT'S KIND OF GROSS.
YOU HAVE A ROTTING PIECE OF
HUMAN WHATEVER ATTACHED YOU
ARE BABY.
IT IS ROTTING, IT IS ROTTING.
THEY SAY LIKE, YOU CAN CURE IT
WITH SALT.
DON'T CURE IT WITH SALT, HAVE
YOUR BABY.
YOU KNOW WHAT WILL MAKE YOUR
BABY HEALTHY?
TAKING CARE OF IT, NOT KEEPING
A ROTTING PIECE OF HUMAN
TISSUE ATTACHED TO IT.
YEAH, AND IT'S WEIRD, AND THE
LOTUS, IT SOUNDS 単
IT SOUNDS LIKE A YOGA THING.
YEAH, WHICH IS THE FIRST WAY I
KNOW IT IS STRANGE, AND NOT
MEDICALLY SOUND.
YOU SEE THE PICTURES OF THE
MOMS, THEY ARE CARRYING THE
BABY, AND YOU SEE THE SACK 単
IT'S TOO MUCH WORK.
IT IS STRANGE.
THERE'S A REASON WHY GOD
INVENTED HOSPITALS.
A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE GOING TO GET
AT ME, AND THEY ARE GOING TO
SAY, NO, AND I HAVE FRIENDS WHO
ARE DELIVERED IN THE WHOLE
THING, WITH THE MIDWIFE AND THE
BATHTUB, AND IT WAS IN LIQUID.
IF I WERE WEALTHY, BUT I WOULD
DO IS, I WOULD TURN MY BATHROOM
INTO A SPA-LIKE HOSPITAL
SITUATION.
I WANT A MIDWIFE THERE.
NO OFFENSE TO MIDWIVES, BUT YOU
ARE NOT GOOD ENOUGH.
I WANT TO DOCTOR.
WHAT IF SOMETHING GOES WRONG?
WHAT IF I'M LOSING TOO MUCH
BLOOD?
WHAT IS MY BIG LIFE 単 WHAT IS MY
MIDWIFE GOING TO DO?
CALL THE DOCTOR.
IN NO WAY IS ANYONE I KNOW
GIVING DELIVERED 単
GIVING BIRTH WITHOUT A DOCTOR
RIGHT THERE.
FOR THE DOCTOR BEING IN A
DIFFERENT BUILDING, NO WE
ARE NOT DOING THAT.
SO, I KNOW THERE IS A WHOLE
RANGE, AND GOD BLESS YOU IF
YOU DO THAT RANGE, AND WE
ARE PROBABLY BEING TOO
JUDGMENTAL, BUT THE LOTUS BIRTH?
DON'T DO THAT.
THE PLACENTA, IF YOU WANT TO
KEEP IT FOR A COUPLE
MINUTES, COUPLE HOURS.
IF YOU WANT TO EAT YOUR
PLACENTA.
NO!
SOME WOMEN DO IT.
OR HAVE A HOME BIRTH, THAT'S
FINE.
BUT DON'T KEEP IT PASSED A
COUPLE HOURS, BECAUSE IT'S
DEAD CELLS AT THAT POINT,
AND THEY DON'T PASS ON
NUTRIENTS, THEY PASS ON
INFECTION.
YOU ARE GOING TO HURT YOUR KIDS,
SO I DON'T CARE HOW NICE IT
SOUNDS, LOTUS BIRTH, DON'T DO
IT, YOU'RE GOING TO GET THE
POOR KIDS SICK.
REMEMBER, WE ARE SUPPOSED TO
BELIEVE IN SCIENCE.
YOU KNOW WHAT KIND OF BIRTH I'M
IN FAVOR OF?
SCIENCE BIRTH.
