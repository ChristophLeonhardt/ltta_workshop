so I would say the most successful bosses don't have a personality type right there's not traits or attributes but there are things that they do being a boss is not it's not a value judgment it's a job and here are the things that great bosses do they start by forming relationship with each of their employees and they form these relationships not by schmoozing after work but in the way that they fulfill there are three key responsibilities they create a culture of feedback they build a great and cohesive team and they achieve results collaboratively and the most important thing that boss will do in all three of these areas is to be a partner to each person on their team not to be a micromanager and that gets a lot of a lot of talk in sort of it's pretty common knowledge that you shouldn't be a micro manager however one mistake I see often especially new managers but even some experienced managers make is in the effort to avoid micromanaging they just become absentee bosses they sort of disappear from view and they they don't really help the people who are working for them achieve success and if somebody comes to work for you it's because you've got something to offer so you you owe them your thought partnership
