1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,639
hey everyone hope all is well I often

2
00:00:02,639 --> 00:00:04,290
get asked why I have a<font color="#E5E5E5"> problem with</font>

3
00:00:04,290 --> 00:00:07,140
money and the monetary<font color="#CCCCCC"> system well for</font>

4
00:00:07,140 --> 00:00:08,880
me it's because<font color="#CCCCCC"> we live in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> an age now</font>

5
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:10,769
where we have<font color="#CCCCCC"> the technology and</font>

6
00:00:10,769 --> 00:00:12,870
know-how to produce enough for everybody

7
00:00:12,870 --> 00:00:15,360
on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the planet so why aren't we doing it</font>

8
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:16,920
well it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> because the monetary system</font>

9
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:19,890
inhibits us which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> so ironic because</font>

10
00:00:19,890 --> 00:00:21,779
the reason money was first brought into

11
00:00:21,779 --> 00:00:24,000
play was to<font color="#E5E5E5"> replace the barter system</font>

12
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,609
and to help with the allocation of goods

13
00:00:26,609 --> 00:00:30,269
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> services which are scarce and that's</font>

14
00:00:30,269 --> 00:00:34,140
a good<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing however as we've moved</font>

15
00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:36,690
along in society we actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> can see the</font>

16
00:00:36,690 --> 00:00:39,360
problems with this system so how is

17
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:43,469
there value in money well it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> because</font>

18
00:00:43,469 --> 00:00:46,649
<font color="#CCCCCC">of supply and demand the more a good is</font>

19
00:00:46,649 --> 00:00:48,899
demanded the higher the price and<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

20
00:00:48,899 --> 00:00:51,600
more you supply of a good or service the

21
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:53,610
lower the price so if<font color="#CCCCCC"> we were to think</font>

22
00:00:53,610 --> 00:00:56,129
of money generally and have a

23
00:00:56,129 --> 00:00:58,829
hypothetical of let's say it was to rain

24
00:00:58,829 --> 00:01:01,500
tonight but it was<font color="#CCCCCC"> no ordinary</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> rain it</font>

25
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:03,719
<font color="#E5E5E5">was to rain money what would happen</font>

26
00:01:03,719 --> 00:01:05,670
people<font color="#CCCCCC"> would go outside</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and grab all the</font>

27
00:01:05,670 --> 00:01:07,439
money they could<font color="#E5E5E5"> and bring it inside</font>

28
00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:10,439
because money the more money have the

29
00:01:10,439 --> 00:01:12,720
greater your purchasing power and you

30
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:14,159
are only as free as your purchasing

31
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:18,299
power in today's society but<font color="#E5E5E5"> if it was</font>

32
00:01:18,299 --> 00:01:21,270
to keep raining money for days weeks<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

33
00:01:21,270 --> 00:01:23,369
<font color="#E5E5E5">months where people's keep doing that</font>

34
00:01:23,369 --> 00:01:26,700
and probably not they not<font color="#CCCCCC"> only ignore</font>

35
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:28,229
the money that was outside because it

36
00:01:28,229 --> 00:01:30,329
was so much of<font color="#E5E5E5"> it they'd actually take</font>

37
00:01:30,329 --> 00:01:31,590
the money inside<font color="#E5E5E5"> their homes and</font>

38
00:01:31,590 --> 00:01:33,240
probably throw it out because<font color="#E5E5E5"> they don't</font>

39
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:35,909
want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> waste all this space with bits</font>

40
00:01:35,909 --> 00:01:38,159
of paper that actually have no real

41
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:40,439
value now because there is so much of it

42
00:01:40,439 --> 00:01:42,540
in the money supply<font color="#E5E5E5"> and that's what</font>

43
00:01:42,540 --> 00:01:43,560
we're seeing happening all around the

44
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:45,450
world today with governments printing

45
00:01:45,450 --> 00:01:46,950
money again and<font color="#E5E5E5"> again to try and deal</font>

46
00:01:46,950 --> 00:01:49,140
with these debt bubbles which is called

47
00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:51,540
quantitative easing but if we<font color="#CCCCCC"> were</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

48
00:01:51,540 --> 00:01:53,610
look at goods and services now let's

49
00:01:53,610 --> 00:01:59,310
look at air and sea water do we<font color="#E5E5E5"> sell it</font>

50
00:01:59,310 --> 00:02:01,890
no and why<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't we sell it because</font>

51
00:02:01,890 --> 00:02:03,719
there is an abundance of it there<font color="#CCCCCC"> is so</font>

52
00:02:03,719 --> 00:02:06,030
much of it it wouldn't be<font color="#E5E5E5"> a profitable</font>

53
00:02:06,030 --> 00:02:08,399
business model but<font color="#E5E5E5"> if we were to take</font>

54
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:10,709
<font color="#E5E5E5">st. like diamonds did you know that</font>

55
00:02:10,709 --> 00:02:13,319
diamonds are artificially scarce they're

56
00:02:13,319 --> 00:02:14,010
actually not

57
00:02:14,010 --> 00:02:15,959
expensive if we<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually put on the</font>

58
00:02:15,959 --> 00:02:18,959
<font color="#CCCCCC">market as many as many diamonds as were</font>

59
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:21,120
found in the ground<font color="#E5E5E5"> because if they find</font>

60
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:24,060
too many they storm away<font color="#E5E5E5"> or</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> burnham</font>

61
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:25,590
because its carbon and therefore it

62
00:02:25,590 --> 00:02:28,650
artificially drives the price up and we

63
00:02:28,650 --> 00:02:30,959
could look at news articles where wind

64
00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:34,019
turbines<font color="#CCCCCC"> have been producing too much</font>

65
00:02:34,019 --> 00:02:37,500
wind energy and therefore governments

66
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:39,659
have paid them<font color="#CCCCCC"> to turn them off because</font>

67
00:02:39,659 --> 00:02:41,730
<font color="#CCCCCC">it was driving down the price of energy</font>

68
00:02:41,730 --> 00:02:44,159
<font color="#E5E5E5">which is just ridiculous and therefore</font>

69
00:02:44,159 --> 00:02:46,859
if<font color="#CCCCCC"> we were to look</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> at farming that is</font>

70
00:02:46,859 --> 00:02:48,209
<font color="#E5E5E5">exactly the problem we have in the world</font>

71
00:02:48,209 --> 00:02:50,790
today farmers in the UK get fined if

72
00:02:50,790 --> 00:02:52,109
they produce too much of a particular

73
00:02:52,109 --> 00:02:54,870
crop because by producing too much it

74
00:02:54,870 --> 00:02:58,139
drives down the amount<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> money they can</font>

75
00:02:58,139 --> 00:03:01,620
get for crops and thus it puts them out

76
00:03:01,620 --> 00:03:04,799
of business and that<font color="#CCCCCC"> everybody is the</font>

77
00:03:04,799 --> 00:03:08,400
sad irony of the monetary<font color="#CCCCCC"> system that it</font>

78
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:10,650
will<font color="#E5E5E5"> never allow us to produce enough</font>

79
00:03:10,650 --> 00:03:14,340
food or enough access to food for

80
00:03:14,340 --> 00:03:15,989
everybody in the world because today we

81
00:03:15,989 --> 00:03:17,220
actually produce enough food for

82
00:03:17,220 --> 00:03:19,349
everybody in the world but not not

83
00:03:19,349 --> 00:03:21,480
everyone has access to it because if

84
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:24,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">everyone had access to food it wouldn't</font>

85
00:03:24,150 --> 00:03:26,519
be<font color="#CCCCCC"> a profitable business and that ladies</font>

86
00:03:26,519 --> 00:03:28,379
and gentlemen is the challenge<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we</font>

87
00:03:28,379 --> 00:03:31,459
<font color="#CCCCCC">have in the 21st century</font>

88
00:03:35,050 --> 00:00:00,000
thanks a lot and a dios<font color="#CCCCCC"> the next time</font>
