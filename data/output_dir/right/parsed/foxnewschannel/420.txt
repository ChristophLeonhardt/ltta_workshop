TRACKED HIM DOWN.
STEVE: BUT, THEY HAVE GOT
THEIR MAN.
MEANWHILE, HILLARY CLINTON
IS GOING BACK AFTER THE
DEPLORABLE THEME WITH SOME
OF HER FAVORITE THAT FAILED
IN 2016.
>> HE HAS BEEN RACIST.
HE HAS BEEN SEXIST.
HE HAS BEEN ISLAMOPHOBIC.
HE HAS BEEN ANTI-LBGTQ.
I MEAN, THERE IS A LONG
LIST.
HE TALKS TO THAT AMERICA.
HE TALKS TO THEM ALL THE
TIME IT IS A VERY HARD CORE
WHO ARE RESPONDING TO HIM
AND SUPPORTING HIM.
AINSLEY: HILLARY CLINTON
RATTLING OFF LIST OF
INSULTS.
HERE TO REACT IS FOX NATION
HOST TOMI LAHREN.
>> GOOD TO SEE YOU GUYS.
WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO WITH
HILLARY.
AINSLEY: TUCKER CARLSON
SAYING THIS IS DEPLORABLE
2.0.
ATTACKING THE PEOPLE WHO
VOTED FOR PRESIDENT TRUMP.
IT SOUNDS LIKE.
>> WELL, YOU GUYS ARE
EXACTLY RIGHT.
EARLIER, WHEN SHE IS
ATTACKING PRESIDENT DONALD
TRUMP.
SHE IS ACTUALLY ATTACKING
AMERICANS AND SHE IS
ATTACKING HIS SUPPORTERS.
AND SHE COULDN'T BE MORE
TONE DEAF.
WHAT SHE IS REALLY DOING
WHEN SHE IS SAYING HE IS
RACIST AND DISTRACT FROM THE
POINT THAT BLACK
UNEMPLOYMENT IS HISTORIC
LOWS.
WHEN SHE IS SAYING HE IS
SEXIST TRYING TO DISTRACT
FROM THE G.D.P. GROWTH OVER
4%.
WHEN SHE SAYS HE IS
ISLAMOPHOBIC.
TRYING TO DISTRACT FROM THE
FACT COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF
OVERSEEING THE ISIS.
TRYING TO ACCOMPLISHMENTS,
AND DISTRACT VOTERS.
IT'S NOT GOING TO WORK.
STEVE: MEANWHILE, TOMI, YOU
HAVE A NUMBER OF MEMBERS OF
THE MAINSTREAM MEDIA.
THEY HAVE TRIED TO DO THEIR
BEST, IT APPEARS, TO
DIMINISH JUDGE KAVANAUGH.
I KNOW THERE WAS A "U.S.A.
TODAY" OPINION PIECE THAT
SAID THAT KAVANAUGH SHOULD
STAY OFF THE BASKETBALL
COURTS.
HE SHOULD NOT BE COACHING
CHILDREN.
AND THEN THERE WAS A CARTOON
THAT WAS WIDELY CIRCULATED
THAT SHOWED KAVANAUGH'S
10-YEAR-OLD DAUGHTER PRAYING
FOR DR. FORD.
AND THERE IT IS RIGHT THERE.
WHAT DO YOU THINK IS GOING
ON HERE?
IT LOOKS LIKE SOME IS ALL IN
ON KILLING KAVANAUGH.
>> IMAGINE THAT OF COURSE.
THE MAINSTREAM MEDIA IS ALL
IN ON KILLING ANYTHING THAT
HAS TO DO WITH PRAWFN AND
KAVANAUGH IS JUST ANOTHER
SYMPTOM OF OF THAT TRUMP
DERANGEMENT SYNDROME.
FURTHERMORE, THEY ARE NOT
HELPING THEMSELVES BY DOING.
THIS ALL THEY ARE DOING FOR
KAVANAUGH SUPPORTERS, FOR
TRUMP SUPPORTERS AND
AMERICANS CONCERNED WITH DUE
PROCESS.
JUSTICE AND HAVING A GREAT
SUPREME COURT JUSTICE.
ALL THEY ARE DOING IN THE
MAINSTREAM MEDIA AND ON THE
LEFT ARE ENCOURAGING TRUMP
SUPPORTERS AND RED WAIVE TO
COME OUT IN FORCE.
WHAT THEY THINK THEY ARE
DOING IS CHANGING THE MINDS
OF VOTERS AND THINK THEY ARE
GOING TO MAKE A BLUE WAVE.
IN FACT WHAT THEY ARE DOING
IS STRENGTH THE RED WAVE,
THEY WILL SEE THAT IN
NOVEMBER.
BRIAN: REPUBLICANS ARE
BEGINNING TO SURGE IN THE
GENERIC POLL.
WONDER HOW MUCH IS GOING TO
HINGE ON KAVANAUGH
ESPECIALLY HEIDI HEITKAMP
DOWN BY 10 POINTS IN NORTH
DAKOTA.
DEMOCRATIC SENATOR THERE
MIGHT SHE NOT HAVE A CHOICE
TO VOTE FOR BRETT KAVANAUGH?
>> I HOPE THAT SOME OF THESE
DEMOCRATS IN VULNERABLE
STATES LIKE NORTH DAKOTA ARE
REALLY PAYING ATTENTION TO
WHAT'S GOING ON THIS DOESN'T
EVEN FALL ON PARTY LINES
AMERICANS ARE QUITE TIRED OF
IT.
>> 344 MINUTES ON
ACCUSATIONS AGAINST
CAUSATIVE AMONGST THE
NETWORKS.
14 MINUTES ON KAVANAUGH'S
DENIALS.
AND THIS IS MEDIA RESEARCH
CENTER LOOKED AT ABC, CBS,
AND NTSB MORNING AND EVENING
NEWS BETWEEN SEPTEMBER 13TH
AND THE 24TH.
WHAT'S YOUR REACTION TO
THAT?
IS THAT FAIR?
>> WELL, OF COURSE IT'S NOT
FAIR.
BUT I THINK OUT AMERICAN
PEOPLE GO OUTSIDE OF A LOT
OF THINGS FROM NEWS AS WELL.
THEY ARE LOOKING AT SOCIAL
MEDIA.
THEY AT WATCHING FOX NEWS TO
GET THE REAL STORY.
THEY ARE PAYING ATTENTION TO
OTHER PEOPLE THAT HAVE
ANALYSIS ON THIS.
BECAUSE THEY DON'T TRUST THE
MAINSTREAM MEDIA.
THE LEFTIST MAINSTREAM MEDIA
ANYMORE.
AGAIN, THEY ARE SHOOTING
THEMSELVES IN THE FOOT WITH
THIS CONTINUOUS, NEGATIVE
COVERAGE BECAUSE THE
AMERICAN PEOPLE DON'T WANT
TO SEE A GOOD MAN BE TREATED
THIS WAY.
DOESN'T MATTER IF HE IS
CONSERVATIVE, LIBERAL, OR IN
THE MIDDLE.
THE AMERICAN PEOPLE DO NOT
WANT TO SEE THIS HAPPEN TO A
GOOD MAN.
STEVE: WELL, THE FBI REPORT
COULD BE SUBMITTED TO THE
ADMINISTRATION LATER TODAY.
COULD BE A VOTE LATER THIS
WEEK.
SO STAY TUNED.
TOMI, THANK YOU VERY MUCH
FOR JOINING US U OF COURSE,
ONE OF THE HOSTS FROM FOX
NATION.
