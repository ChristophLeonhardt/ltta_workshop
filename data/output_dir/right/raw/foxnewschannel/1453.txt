1
00:00:09,019 --> 00:00:09,719
>> Laura: PICKING UP WHERE WE

2
00:00:09,719 --> 00:00:11,488
LEFT OFF IN LAST NIGHTS ANGLE,

3
00:00:11,488 --> 00:00:13,657
WE ARE LOOKING INTO THE ROLE

4
00:00:13,657 --> 00:00:15,792
FORMER OBAMA OFFICIALS PLAYED IN

5
00:00:15,792 --> 00:00:16,993
SETTING AN INTEL TRAP AGAINST

6
00:00:16,993 --> 00:00:17,494
THE TRUMP CHAIN.

7
00:00:17,494 --> 00:00:21,565
BUT THE DAM OF EVIDENCE NOW

8
00:00:21,565 --> 00:00:22,632
BURSTING, FORMER OBAMA OFFICIALS

9
00:00:22,632 --> 00:00:24,968
ARE TRYING TO MUDDY THE WATERS

10
00:00:24,968 --> 00:00:26,336
BUT DOING SO IN CONFUSION.

11
00:00:26,336 --> 00:00:29,106
>> IS THERE ANYTHING IN THE

12
00:00:29,106 --> 00:00:31,108
DOSSIER THAT HAS BEEN DISPROVEN?

13
00:00:31,108 --> 00:00:33,009
>> NO, SOME OF IT HASN'T BEEN

14
00:00:33,009 --> 00:00:34,878
PROVEN AND SOME OF IT HASN'T

15
00:00:34,878 --> 00:00:37,180
BEEN -- NO.

16
00:00:37,180 --> 00:00:41,251
I GUESS THE SHORT ANSWER TO THE

17
00:00:41,251 --> 00:00:43,220
QUESTION, THERE IS NO

18
00:00:43,220 --> 00:00:55,599
COOPERATION OF THAT

19
00:01:03,039 --> 00:01:03,406
KNOWLEDGE.

20
00:01:03,406 --> 00:01:04,040
>> Laura: NOTHING HAS BEEN

21
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:04,407
DISPROVED?

22
00:01:04,407 --> 00:01:04,908
HOW WOULD HE KNOW?

23
00:01:04,908 --> 00:01:05,642
HE HASN'T BEEN THE DIRECTOR FOR

24
00:01:05,642 --> 00:01:06,143
A YEAR AND A HALF.

25
00:01:06,143 --> 00:01:06,776
AND THAT'S OPPOSITE OF THE

26
00:01:06,776 --> 00:01:07,077
TREES.

27
00:01:07,077 --> 00:01:07,777
NONE OF THE WILD CLAIMS IN THE

28
00:01:07,777 --> 00:01:08,478
DOSSIER HAVE BEEN PROVEN, NOT

29
00:01:08,478 --> 00:01:08,845
PUBLICLY.

30
00:01:08,845 --> 00:01:09,579
YOU CAN BET IF ANYONE WERE TRUE,

31
00:01:09,579 --> 00:01:10,247
THAT WOULD BE FOUND BY NOW.

32
00:01:10,247 --> 00:01:10,947
FLAPPERS STATEMENT ISN'T EVEN

33
00:01:10,947 --> 00:01:11,515
ACCURATE, THE DOSSIER

34
00:01:11,515 --> 00:01:12,349
INCORRECTLY CLAIMED THAT

35
00:01:12,349 --> 00:01:14,885
MICHAEL: WENT TO PRAGUE TO MEET

36
00:01:14,885 --> 00:01:15,385
WITH THE RUSSIANS.

37
00:01:15,385 --> 00:01:17,287
OF COURSE HE'S NEVER BEEN TO

38
00:01:17,287 --> 00:01:19,089
PRAGUE, NO PUBLIC EVIDENCE OF

39
00:01:19,089 --> 00:01:19,523
THAT.

40
00:01:19,523 --> 00:01:20,690
BUT WHAT'S REALLY TELLING ABOUT

41
00:01:20,690 --> 00:01:22,526
CLAPPER'S REMARK IS THAT HE

42
00:01:22,526 --> 00:01:24,394
GIVES AWAY THE DEEP STATE

43
00:01:24,394 --> 00:01:25,128
STRATEGY.

44
00:01:25,128 --> 00:01:26,930
WHAT IS IT?

45
00:01:26,930 --> 00:01:28,331
IT'S BASICALLY CREATE SO MUCH

46
00:01:28,331 --> 00:01:28,965
DOUBT AND CONFUSION THAT

47
00:01:28,965 --> 00:01:30,567
AMERICANS GIVE UP TRYING TO MAKE

48
00:01:30,567 --> 00:01:31,935
SENSE OF ANY OF IT.

49
00:01:31,935 --> 00:01:34,638
TO THAT END, CLAPPER AND FELLOW

50
00:01:34,638 --> 00:01:36,573
OBAMA ALUMS ARE PUSHING THE LINE

51
00:01:36,573 --> 00:01:40,277
THAT, IF A DOSSIER CAN'T BE

52
00:01:40,277 --> 00:01:43,113
DISPROVED, IT MUST BE TRUE.

53
00:01:43,113 --> 00:01:44,881
WELL LET'S DISCUSS HOW WELL THAT

54
00:01:44,881 --> 00:01:47,050
STRATEGY WILL WORK IN LIGHT OF

55
00:01:47,050 --> 00:01:49,886
ALL THE RECENT DEVELOPMENTS WITH

56
00:01:49,886 --> 00:01:51,788
FORMER CIA ANALYST JOHN KERRY

57
00:01:51,788 --> 00:01:52,455
ARCO, REPUBLICAN CONGRESSMAN

58
00:01:52,455 --> 00:01:58,161
STEVE RUSSELL, AND ASSISTANT

59
00:01:58,161 --> 00:01:59,095
ATTORNEY GENERAL ROBERT DISTRICT

60
00:01:59,095 --> 00:02:00,697
ON MIKE DRISCOLL.

61
00:02:00,697 --> 00:02:02,699
CONGRESSMAN, THIS IS WILD.

62
00:02:02,699 --> 00:02:05,502
I MEAN THE NEVER ENDING MEDIA

63
00:02:05,502 --> 00:02:06,903
APPEARANCES BY JIM KLAPPER.

64
00:02:06,903 --> 00:02:08,305
WE WERE JOKING EARLIER, HE MUST

65
00:02:08,305 --> 00:02:09,906
BE PROMOTING A BOOK.

66
00:02:09,906 --> 00:02:10,840
AND HE IS INDEED.

67
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:13,376
WHAT'S YOUR TAKE ON WHAT HE SAID

68
00:02:13,376 --> 00:02:14,511
RIGHT THERE?

69
00:02:14,511 --> 00:02:16,913
>> IT JUST SHOWS THAT THIS IS

70
00:02:16,913 --> 00:02:17,847
REALLY A HOUSE OF CARDS.

71
00:02:17,847 --> 00:02:19,549
YOU THINK THEY ARE TRYING TO

72
00:02:19,549 --> 00:02:20,317
MAKE SOMETHING THAT THERE IS NO

73
00:02:20,317 --> 00:02:21,985
EVIDENCE OF AND WHEN THEY TALK

74
00:02:21,985 --> 00:02:25,288
ABOUT PEOPLE BEING GUILTY AND

75
00:02:25,288 --> 00:02:26,690
ADDS NO EVIDENCE OF COLLUSION.

76
00:02:26,690 --> 00:02:28,925
THEY SEE RIGHT THROUGH THIS AND

77
00:02:28,925 --> 00:02:30,994
IT'S A CONTINUAL STRAW MAN

78
00:02:30,994 --> 00:02:33,797
ARGUMENT AND THEY CONTINUE TO

79
00:02:33,797 --> 00:02:35,832
PUSH IT EVERY WAY THEY CAN.

80
00:02:35,832 --> 00:02:38,168
>> Laura: THAT MEETING AT THE

81
00:02:38,168 --> 00:02:40,770
WHITE HOUSE TODAY, IT'S NOT

82
00:02:40,770 --> 00:02:44,174
CLEAR WHAT DOCUMENTS WERE

83
00:02:44,174 --> 00:02:45,075
ACTUALLY PRESENTED TO DEVIN

84
00:02:45,075 --> 00:02:46,376
NUNES OR TO TREY GADDY.

85
00:02:46,376 --> 00:02:48,211
WERE THEY ABLE TO LOOK AT THE

86
00:02:48,211 --> 00:02:50,013
DOCUMENTS WERE NOT LOOK AT THE

87
00:02:50,013 --> 00:02:50,614
DOCUMENTS?

88
00:02:50,614 --> 00:02:54,017
THE DETAILS OF THE MEETING WILL

89
00:02:54,017 --> 00:02:54,818
NOT BE RELEASED.

90
00:02:54,818 --> 00:02:57,287
>> THEY WERE TIGHT-LIPPED ABOUT

91
00:02:57,287 --> 00:02:57,587
THIS.

92
00:02:57,587 --> 00:02:59,990
>> AS THEY SHOULD BE.

93
00:02:59,990 --> 00:03:02,826
BUT I THINK THE BIGGER CONCERN

94
00:03:02,826 --> 00:03:04,060
IS, WILL DEVON NUNEZ AND TREY

95
00:03:04,060 --> 00:03:07,430
GOWDY BE ABLE TO GET THE

96
00:03:07,430 --> 00:03:08,064
INFORMATION, LOOK AT THE

97
00:03:08,064 --> 00:03:09,833
INFORMATION WITHOUT REDUCTION?

98
00:03:09,833 --> 00:03:11,134
WE SEE THESE PROBLEMS WHERE THEY

99
00:03:11,134 --> 00:03:14,070
WILL REDACT THINGS, WITHHOLDING

100
00:03:14,070 --> 00:03:15,038
IT FROM CONGRESS.

101
00:03:15,038 --> 00:03:17,774
WELL, SINCE 1840 IN THE

102
00:03:17,774 --> 00:03:19,042
OVERSIGHT COMMITTEE, WE HAVE

103
00:03:19,042 --> 00:03:19,643
THAT RESPONSIBILITY.

104
00:03:19,643 --> 00:03:21,177
NOTHING SHOULD BE REDACTED FROM

105
00:03:21,177 --> 00:03:23,747
CONGRESS, THEY NEED TO GET TO

106
00:03:23,747 --> 00:03:24,714
THE FACTS.

107
00:03:24,714 --> 00:03:26,283
>> Laura: THIS IS WHAT ADAM

108
00:03:26,283 --> 00:03:28,852
SCHIFF SAID ABOUT THE MEETING,

109
00:03:28,852 --> 00:03:29,252
LET'S WATCH.

110
00:03:29,252 --> 00:03:31,121
>> NOTHING WE HEARD TODAY HAS

111
00:03:31,121 --> 00:03:32,722
CHANGED OUR VIEW, THAT THERE IS

112
00:03:32,722 --> 00:03:34,124
NO EVIDENCE TO SUPPORT ANY

113
00:03:34,124 --> 00:03:37,360
ALLEGATION THAT THE FBI OR ANY

114
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:39,129
INTELLIGENCE AGENCY PLACED A SPY

115
00:03:39,129 --> 00:03:41,331
IN THE KEY TRUMP CAMPAIGN OR

116
00:03:41,331 --> 00:03:43,600
OTHERWISE FAILED TO FOLLOW

117
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:46,069
APPROPRIATE PROCEDURES AND

118
00:03:46,069 --> 00:03:46,970
PROTOCOLS.

119
00:03:46,970 --> 00:03:48,204
>> Laura: APPARENTLY THEY

120
00:03:48,204 --> 00:03:49,139
ACTUALLY DIDN'T HAVE THE ACCESS

121
00:03:49,139 --> 00:03:50,573
TO THE DOCUMENTS THAT THEY

122
00:03:50,573 --> 00:03:55,912
WANTED, AT LEAST IT'S NOT CLEAR

123
00:03:55,912 --> 00:03:59,416
THAT THEY DID.

124
00:03:59,416 --> 00:04:00,116
APPARENTLY THEY DIDN'T SEE ALL

125
00:04:00,116 --> 00:04:00,684
THE DOCUMENTS, AGAIN.

126
00:04:00,684 --> 00:04:01,451
>> AND WHAT I TOOK FROM WHAT HE

127
00:04:01,451 --> 00:04:02,252
SAID, IT'S VERY CAREFULLY WORDED

128
00:04:02,252 --> 00:04:02,619
STATEMENT.

129
00:04:02,619 --> 00:04:03,353
THERE IS NO EVIDENCE THAT THEY

130
00:04:03,353 --> 00:04:05,922
PLACED A SPY IN THE CAMPAIGN.

131
00:04:05,922 --> 00:04:08,124
I COULD STILL MEAN YOU HAD A

132
00:04:08,124 --> 00:04:10,527
CONFIDENTIAL INFORMANT CONTACT

133
00:04:10,527 --> 00:04:11,995
PEOPLE ON THE CAMPAIGN AND

134
00:04:11,995 --> 00:04:12,996
RECORD THEIR CONVERSATION, IT

135
00:04:12,996 --> 00:04:14,798
MEANS THEY DIDN'T HAVE AN IN BED

136
00:04:14,798 --> 00:04:16,132
IN THE CAMPAIGN.

137
00:04:16,132 --> 00:04:17,934
I GET THAT, BUT IT'S NOT

138
00:04:17,934 --> 00:04:19,502
NECESSARILY WHAT IS OF MOST

139
00:04:19,502 --> 00:04:20,337
CONCERN TO CONGRESS.

140
00:04:20,337 --> 00:04:22,038
I THINK WHAT IS INTERESTING TO

141
00:04:22,038 --> 00:04:23,373
ME IS THAT TRUMP COULD

142
00:04:23,373 --> 00:04:24,007
DECLASSIFY ALL THIS STUFF

143
00:04:24,007 --> 00:04:26,376
HIMSELF WITH THE STROKE OF A

144
00:04:26,376 --> 00:04:26,943
PEN.

145
00:04:26,943 --> 00:04:28,812
HE'S ACTUALLY SHOWING SOME

146
00:04:28,812 --> 00:04:31,181
DEFERENCE TO THE DOJ.

147
00:04:31,181 --> 00:04:32,515
HE'S ALMOST PLAYING A MEDIATING

148
00:04:32,515 --> 00:04:34,617
ROLE RATHER THAN ACTING AS THE

149
00:04:34,617 --> 00:04:35,985
HEAD OF THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH

150
00:04:35,985 --> 00:04:37,587
SAME, CONGRESS HAS A POINT,

151
00:04:37,587 --> 00:04:39,589
THERE NEEDS TO BE MORE

152
00:04:39,589 --> 00:04:40,390
TRANSPARENCY HERE.

153
00:04:40,390 --> 00:04:44,060
I'M NOT GOING TO FORCE YOU TO

154
00:04:44,060 --> 00:04:45,995
DISCLOSE EVERYTHING.

155
00:04:45,995 --> 00:04:47,397
>> Laura: HONEST REASONS FOR

156
00:04:47,397 --> 00:04:47,764
REDUCTION.

157
00:04:47,764 --> 00:04:50,700
>> BUT I COULDN'T GET OVER THE

158
00:04:50,700 --> 00:04:52,435
$70,000 CONFERENCE ROOM TABLE

159
00:04:52,435 --> 00:04:53,670
THAT SENATOR MCCAIN BROUGHT.

160
00:04:53,670 --> 00:04:55,638
>> THEN THEY GET ON BEN CARSON'S

161
00:04:55,638 --> 00:04:56,840
WIFE FOR THE TABLE.

162
00:04:56,840 --> 00:04:58,842
HOW MUCH WAS THAT?

163
00:04:58,842 --> 00:04:59,175
11,000?

164
00:04:59,175 --> 00:05:02,512
WHERE DO THEY GET THEIR TABLES?

165
00:05:02,512 --> 00:05:07,350
THEY MUST GO TO THE STOREHOUSE

166
00:05:07,350 --> 00:05:07,751
OR WHATEVER.

167
00:05:07,751 --> 00:05:09,319
COME ON.

168
00:05:09,319 --> 00:05:10,019
WE'VE BEEN TALKING A LOT ABOUT

169
00:05:10,019 --> 00:05:10,687
THE OVERREACH OF THE

170
00:05:10,687 --> 00:05:11,287
SURVEILLANCE STATE.

171
00:05:11,287 --> 00:05:14,724
I DID A BIG PIECE ON THIS LAST

172
00:05:14,724 --> 00:05:15,024
NIGHT.

173
00:05:15,024 --> 00:05:17,861
SINCE 9/11, I GUESS ALL THESE

174
00:05:17,861 --> 00:05:19,796
GOOD INTENTIONS -- WE WANT TO

175
00:05:19,796 --> 00:05:22,532
KEEP THE NATION SAFE, BUT WE

176
00:05:22,532 --> 00:05:23,933
HAVE CREATED A SURVEILLANCE

177
00:05:23,933 --> 00:05:27,570
SUPERSTATE IN THIS COUNTRY.

178
00:05:27,570 --> 00:05:31,074
AND I THINK ALL THESE PEOPLE AT

179
00:05:31,074 --> 00:05:32,609
THE TOP THINK THEY ARE BEYOND

180
00:05:32,609 --> 00:05:34,310
REPROACH AND THEY ARE SO

181
00:05:34,310 --> 00:05:35,945
CONFIDENT THAT THEY ARE RIGHT,

182
00:05:35,945 --> 00:05:38,415
THEY WANT TO DO WHAT THEY WANT

183
00:05:38,415 --> 00:05:40,350
TO DO WITH IMPUNITY.

184
00:05:40,350 --> 00:05:41,951
AND THAT'S THE DEEP STATE.

185
00:05:41,951 --> 00:05:45,989
>> I'M GLAD YOU CALL IT THE DEEP

186
00:05:45,989 --> 00:05:47,957
STATE BECAUSE IT EXISTS.

187
00:05:47,957 --> 00:05:51,995
IT'S THERE, AND IT'S POWER

188
00:05:51,995 --> 00:05:53,696
FOREVER.

189
00:05:53,696 --> 00:05:57,200
AND THOSE PATRIOTS AT THE CIA

190
00:05:57,200 --> 00:05:58,968
AND ELSEWHERE, MANY OF THEM CAME

191
00:05:58,968 --> 00:06:01,237
OF AGE AND ENTERED INTO THE

192
00:06:01,237 --> 00:06:02,305
SENIOR INTELLIGENCE SERVICE

193
00:06:02,305 --> 00:06:03,373
DURING THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION.

194
00:06:03,373 --> 00:06:05,375
FOR MANY OF THEM THAT'S WHERE

195
00:06:05,375 --> 00:06:05,942
THEIR LOYALTIES LIE.

196
00:06:05,942 --> 00:06:08,545
SO THERE REALLY IS A DEEP STATE.

197
00:06:08,545 --> 00:06:10,547
THE CONGRESSMAN MANDATE A VERY

198
00:06:10,547 --> 00:06:12,449
IMPORTANT POINT ALSO AND THAT'S

199
00:06:12,449 --> 00:06:14,350
ABOUT CONGRESSIONAL OVERSIGHT.

200
00:06:14,350 --> 00:06:17,153
THE CIA AS PART OF ITS VERY

201
00:06:17,153 --> 00:06:18,655
NATURE PUSHES BACK ON

202
00:06:18,655 --> 00:06:24,527
CONGRESSIONAL OVERSIGHT, AND

203
00:06:24,527 --> 00:06:29,532
THEY HAVE TO FIGHT FOR ITS

204
00:06:29,532 --> 00:06:30,066
RIGHTFUL OVERSIGHT.

205
00:06:30,066 --> 00:06:35,305
>> AND HE LEAKED THE INFORMATION

206
00:06:35,305 --> 00:06:37,173
ABOUT WATERBOARDING, LONG STORY,

207
00:06:37,173 --> 00:06:39,409
MOST OF THE CHARGES WERE DROPPED

208
00:06:39,409 --> 00:06:40,910
AND ONE REMAINS.

209
00:06:40,910 --> 00:06:43,580
BUT YOU FELT WHAT HAPPENED WHEN

210
00:06:43,580 --> 00:06:45,748
YOU DECIDED TO SAY, IT DIDN'T

211
00:06:45,748 --> 00:06:46,916
SEEM RIGHT TO YOU.

212
00:06:46,916 --> 00:06:50,520
LIKE I DON'T LOSE SLEEP ABOUT

213
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:52,155
WATERBOARDING, I KNOW A LOT OF

214
00:06:52,155 --> 00:06:52,522
PEOPLE DO.

215
00:06:52,522 --> 00:06:54,424
BUT YOU FEEL THAT THE WAY THINGS

216
00:06:54,424 --> 00:06:57,193
HAVE DEVELOPED IN THIS COUNTRY

217
00:06:57,193 --> 00:06:58,595
WITH THE EXPLOSION OF THE INTEL

218
00:06:58,595 --> 00:07:01,331
AGENCIES THAT IT'S VERY HARD FOR

219
00:07:01,331 --> 00:07:04,133
CONGRESSMAN RUSSELL AND DEVIN

220
00:07:04,133 --> 00:07:05,201
NUNES, TREY GOWDY AND FRANKLY

221
00:07:05,201 --> 00:07:08,738
THE DEMOCRATS IF THEY WERE ON TO

222
00:07:08,738 --> 00:07:11,341
ACTUALLY SEE, WHAT'S GOING ON

223
00:07:11,341 --> 00:07:11,975
HERE.

224
00:07:11,975 --> 00:07:14,511
YOU HAVE THESE SITES, AND YOU

225
00:07:14,511 --> 00:07:17,113
WONDER, WHAT'S HAPPENING HERE.

226
00:07:17,113 --> 00:07:19,182
IT HAS A NATURAL TENSION, BUT

227
00:07:19,182 --> 00:07:21,117
IT'S WORSE THE BIGGER THE INTEL

228
00:07:21,117 --> 00:07:22,852
STATE IS, THE SUPERSTATE, THE

229
00:07:22,852 --> 00:07:25,688
HARDER IT IS.

230
00:07:25,688 --> 00:07:27,957
>> CORRECT.

231
00:07:27,957 --> 00:07:31,127
AND REMEMBER I GOT FAR WORSE.

232
00:07:31,127 --> 00:07:33,696
JOHN BRENNAN HAD WHAT FORMER

233
00:07:33,696 --> 00:07:37,934
COLLEAGUES OF MINE HAVE SAID IS

234
00:07:37,934 --> 00:07:49,312
A NIXONIAN OBSESSION.

235
00:07:49,312 --> 00:07:51,581
THAT'S NEARLY THREE TIMES AS ALL

236
00:07:51,581 --> 00:07:53,516
PREVIOUS PRESIDENTS COMBINED AND

237
00:07:53,516 --> 00:07:54,717
IT WASN'T REALLY ABOUT THOSE

238
00:07:54,717 --> 00:07:55,118
INDIVIDUALS.

239
00:07:55,118 --> 00:07:56,219
IT WAS ABOUT SENDING A MESSAGE

240
00:07:56,219 --> 00:07:58,922
TO THE REST OF THE INTELLIGENCE

241
00:07:58,922 --> 00:08:00,423
COMMITTEE TO KEEP YOUR MOUTH

242
00:08:00,423 --> 00:08:00,723
SHUT.

243
00:08:00,723 --> 00:08:01,491
>> Laura: DON'T YOU DARE.

244
00:08:01,491 --> 00:08:05,094
THAT'S A LITTLE MAFIA ASKED.

245
00:08:05,094 --> 00:08:06,696
CONGRESSMAN, I WANT YOU BOTH TO

246
00:08:06,696 --> 00:08:07,030
RESPOND.

247
00:08:07,030 --> 00:08:09,532
YOU CAN SEE WHERE THIS IS GOING.

248
00:08:09,532 --> 00:08:13,403
THE LEFT IS TRYING TO FIND THE

249
00:08:13,536 --> 00:08:15,004
I DON'T THINK INFORMANTS IN THE

250
00:08:15,004 --> 00:08:17,140
CAMPAIGN ARE TRYING TO MAKE

251
00:08:17,140 --> 00:08:18,741
CONTACT WITH THE CAMPAIGN AS A

252
00:08:18,741 --> 00:08:19,342
SIDE ISSUE.

253
00:08:19,342 --> 00:08:21,344
I THINK IT'S A SIDE ISSUE WHEN

254
00:08:21,344 --> 00:08:23,246
THEY SAY, THE PRESIDENT'S LAWYER

255
00:08:23,246 --> 00:08:24,380
AND CHIEF OF STAFF WERE AT A

256
00:08:24,380 --> 00:08:26,149
MEETING FOR A SHORT PERIOD OF

257
00:08:26,149 --> 00:08:26,449
TIME.

258
00:08:26,449 --> 00:08:29,218
THEY WERE FREAKING OUT ABOUT

259
00:08:29,218 --> 00:08:30,753
THIS TODAY, LET'S WATCH.

260
00:08:30,753 --> 00:08:32,589
>> I WAS STUNNED WHEN I HEARD

261
00:08:32,589 --> 00:08:34,357
EMMET FLOOD ATTENDED, EVEN IF HE

262
00:08:34,357 --> 00:08:35,390
WASN'T THERE FOR THE CLASSIFIED

263
00:08:35,390 --> 00:08:38,361
PART OF IT, THAT HE WOULD EVEN

264
00:08:38,361 --> 00:08:38,995
SHOW HIS PRESENCE.

265
00:08:38,995 --> 00:08:40,797
>> THE PRESENCE OF EMMET FLOOD

266
00:08:40,797 --> 00:08:43,765
EVEN IF IT WAS JUST TO MAKE

267
00:08:43,765 --> 00:08:47,570
INTRODUCTORY REMARKS CLEARLY NOW

268
00:08:47,704 --> 00:08:51,975
>> WHAT WE SAW TODAY WAS

269
00:08:51,975 --> 00:08:54,010
IMPROPER, AND IT DID RISK

270
00:08:54,010 --> 00:08:57,280
UNDERMINING PARTS OF THE MUELLER

271
00:08:57,280 --> 00:08:57,614
PROGRAM.

272
00:08:57,614 --> 00:08:59,916
>> Laura: I DON'T KNOW IF

273
00:08:59,916 --> 00:09:01,317
THESE PEOPLE KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT

274
00:09:01,317 --> 00:09:02,085
THE LAW.

275
00:09:02,085 --> 00:09:04,320
THEY WERE THERE TO SAY, WE WANT

276
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:08,124
TO HELP, WE WANT TRANSPARENCY.

277
00:09:08,124 --> 00:09:09,926
AND THEY STAYED APPARENTLY FOR A

278
00:09:09,926 --> 00:09:12,495
SHORTER PERIOD OF TIME, AND THEN

279
00:09:12,495 --> 00:09:13,129
THEY WERE GONE.

280
00:09:13,129 --> 00:09:18,301
>> IT'S THE TYPICAL PLAYBOOK.

281
00:09:18,301 --> 00:09:21,204
PUT UP SOME SHINY OBJECT AND

282
00:09:21,204 --> 00:09:25,274
DISTRACT FROM THE FACT.

283
00:09:25,274 --> 00:09:26,075
>> ROBERT.

284
00:09:26,075 --> 00:09:28,778
>> AGAIN, IT'S KIND OF

285
00:09:28,778 --> 00:09:29,312
COMMONPLACE.

286
00:09:29,312 --> 00:09:30,346
THE PRESIDENT AGAIN IS PLAYING A

287
00:09:30,346 --> 00:09:31,948
MEDIATING ROLE IN THIS AND I

288
00:09:31,948 --> 00:09:32,682
THINK ALL THAT HAPPENED WAS A

289
00:09:32,682 --> 00:09:36,686
FLOOD WAS THERE AT THE

290
00:09:36,686 --> 00:09:37,920
BEGINNING, HE SAID THE PRESIDENT

291
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:39,889
WANTS YOU GUYS TO RELEASE AS

292
00:09:39,889 --> 00:09:42,158
MUCH AS YOU CAN, AND THEN THEY

293
00:09:42,158 --> 00:09:45,461
WALKED OUT PRIOR TO THE

294
00:09:45,461 --> 00:09:46,095
CLASSIFIED PORTION OF THE

295
00:09:46,095 --> 00:09:48,031
BRIEFINGS.

296
00:09:48,031 --> 00:09:59,842
>> Laura:

297
00:10:14,357 --> 00:10:15,091
MEETING, LIKE CALLING ON YOU AND

298
00:10:15,091 --> 00:10:15,358
YOU.

299
00:10:15,358 --> 00:10:15,958
THAT'S HOW IT WENT DOWN.

300
00:10:15,958 --> 00:10:16,659
>> YOU HAVE TO PICK A BRANCH,

301
00:10:16,659 --> 00:10:17,260
AND THE DOJ WORK FOR THE

302
00:10:17,260 --> 00:10:17,827
PRESIDENT SO IT'S NOT

303
00:10:17,827 --> 00:10:18,394
INAPPROPRIATE FOR THE

304
00:10:18,394 --> 00:10:19,028
PRESIDENT AND WHITE HOUSE

305
00:10:19,028 --> 00:10:19,696
COUNSEL TO SAY PRIOR TO THE

306
00:10:19,696 --> 00:10:20,430
MEETING, WE WORK FOR US, HERE'S

307
00:10:20,430 --> 00:10:21,130
WHERE THE BOSS WANTS TO GO FOR

308
00:10:21,130 --> 00:10:21,431
THIS.

309
00:10:21,431 --> 00:10:22,131
HE WANTS MAXIMUM TRANSPARENCY.

310
00:10:22,131 --> 00:10:22,799
>> Laura: I HAVE TO ASK YOU,

311
00:10:22,799 --> 00:10:23,533
WHAT IS THE LIKELIHOOD THAT ONLY

312
00:10:23,533 --> 00:10:23,966
ONE INFORMANT.

313
00:10:23,966 --> 00:10:27,003
THIS HAPLESS HELPER, APPARENTLY,

314
00:10:27,003 --> 00:10:27,670
THIS PROFESSOR, IS THE ONLY

315
00:10:27,670 --> 00:10:28,404
PERSON WHO WAS TASKED WITH SOME

316
00:10:28,404 --> 00:10:29,105
TYPE OF OUTREACH TO THE TRUMP

317
00:10:29,105 --> 00:10:29,472
CAMPAIGN.

318
00:10:29,472 --> 00:10:30,173
DOESN'T THAT SEEM ODD THAT IT

319
00:10:30,173 --> 00:10:31,140
WOULD BE JUST ONE GUY?

320
00:10:31,140 --> 00:10:33,910
IF THEY REALLY WANT TO GET

321
00:10:33,910 --> 00:10:36,779
ANSWERS, JUST ONE GUY?

322
00:10:36,779 --> 00:10:38,114
>> THE AUSTRALIAN CONTACT WAS

323
00:10:38,114 --> 00:10:40,116
THE ONE THAT WAS ALWAYS A

324
00:10:40,116 --> 00:10:40,717
QUESTION TO ME.

325
00:10:40,717 --> 00:10:42,618
I'VE BEEN IN A LOT OF BARS WITH

326
00:10:42,618 --> 00:10:43,986
A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO HAVE SAID

327
00:10:43,986 --> 00:10:45,922
STUPID STUFF, AND THE NOTION

328
00:10:45,922 --> 00:10:47,757
THAT I WOULD RUN TO THE FBI OR

329
00:10:47,757 --> 00:10:49,392
RUN TO AN INTELLIGENCE AGENCY

330
00:10:49,392 --> 00:10:54,063
BASED ON A LATE NIGHT

331
00:10:54,063 --> 00:10:58,101
CONVERSATION, AND IT SEEMS KIND

332
00:10:58,101 --> 00:11:04,941
OF STRANGE TO ME.

333
00:11:04,941 --> 00:11:12,115
AND IT'S COMMON BEHAVIOR,

334
00:11:12,115 --> 00:11:14,917
>> Laura: WE ARE ALMOST OUT OF

335
00:11:14,917 --> 00:11:17,086
TIME, BUT I WILL BRING MORE

336
00:11:17,086 --> 00:11:17,487
PEOPLE BACK.

337
00:11:17,487 --> 00:11:25,928
I WOULD BRING A LEG AT TERRA

338
00:11:25,928 --> 00:11:27,630
POLSKA, AND I WOULD GET ALL

339
00:11:27,630 --> 00:11:28,531
THESE PEOPLE BACK.

340
00:11:28,531 --> 00:11:31,534
THEY ARE NOT GETTING THE ANSWERS

341
00:11:31,534 --> 00:11:32,535
WE DESERVE.

342
00:11:32,535 --> 00:00:00,000
AND BRINGING PEOPLE BACK TO
