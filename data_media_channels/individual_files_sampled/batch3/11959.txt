speaking of Russia gate the Democratic minority in the US House Intelligence Committee has claimed it's exposed what it calls Russia's effort to sow discord online and to prove it they've published hundreds of tweets by our Twitter account RT comm by the way if you aren't following yet now is a good time to start well we'll cross live for more details on this story to our Washington correspondent Samira Khan Samira fill us in on what's been happening well the House Intelligence Committee closed its investigation into alleged Russian interference back in April after failing to find any conclusive evidence linking Russia to the crime but today the same committee has publicly released all of our networks Twitter adds a move which appears to be an attempt to save the Russia gate Theory from extinction a representative Adam Schiff released a statement explaining the decision saying by releasing this Twitter data we hope that researchers will continue their important work exposing any additional Russian operators who use similar tactics and themes and provide the American people with additional information to protect our elections and political debate in the future and the official statement also contained a hundred page document listing each and every one of our T's advertisers and Promoted Tweets from 2016 all 1,700 of them but most of these tweets weren't in any way related to the election some of them even non political stories so the assumption that our networks tweets somehow influenced the u.s. presidential election and trumps favor sounds pretty outlandish considering that some of the tweets included on the list were not political at all but apparently those tweets are examples of tactics and themes used by Russian operators that managed to influence American voters and handed Trump his historic election victory so we looked into how many tweets were actually election related about 22% at most and to be even more precise Hillary Clinton was mentioned about a hundred times and Donald Trump about a hundred and seventy five times it should be noted that Twitter approached us before the election with a multi-million dollar advertising proposal to promote our election coverage we rejected that proposal after that Twitter under pressure from the US government banned us from advertising on its form despite the fact we weren't violating in any of their rules so considering that we can't have ver tiser promote any of our tweets logically speaking the house Intel committee shouldn't be worried about us influencing the outcome of the 2018 midterm election so we'll just have to see what happens with that yeah we certainly will artis Mirek on their reporting live from Washington you
