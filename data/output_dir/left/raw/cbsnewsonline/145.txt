1
00:00:00,934 --> 00:00:04,437
MANY CONSERVATIVES AFTER HE WAS 

2
00:00:04,437 --> 00:00:05,105
INSTALLED. 

3
00:00:05,105 --> 00:00:06,039
>> WELL, HE FRUSTRATED 

4
00:00:06,039 --> 00:00:06,539
CONSERVATIVES. 

5
00:00:06,539 --> 00:00:08,041
JUSTICE KENNEDY WAS THE THIRD 

6
00:00:08,041 --> 00:00:10,610
NOMINEE TO FILL THE SEAT BACK 

7
00:00:10,610 --> 00:00:13,079
WHEN HE WAS NOMINATED IN 1987 

8
00:00:13,079 --> 00:00:14,647
BECAUSE THE FIRST TWO NOMINEES, 

9
00:00:14,647 --> 00:00:18,251
ROBERT BORKE WAS VOTED DOWN IN 

10
00:00:18,251 --> 00:00:20,387
THE SENATE AND DANIEL GINSBURG 

11
00:00:20,387 --> 00:00:21,388
HAD TO WITHDRAW HIS NOMINATION. 

12
00:00:21,388 --> 00:00:25,959
SO IN SOME WAYS HE WAS SEEN AS 

13
00:00:25,959 --> 00:00:27,226
A CONSENSUS PICK. 

14
00:00:27,226 --> 00:00:28,428
HE WAS CONFIRMED IN 1988. 

15
00:00:28,428 --> 00:00:30,797
AND THEN HE GOT ON THE COURT 

16
00:00:30,797 --> 00:00:33,967
AND HE BEGAN ISSUING A NUMBER 

17
00:00:33,967 --> 00:00:34,901
OF CONSERVATIVE DECISIONS. 

18
00:00:34,901 --> 00:00:36,269
HE WAS CONSERVATIVE THIS TERM, 

19
00:00:36,269 --> 00:00:36,770
BY THE WAY. 

20
00:00:36,770 --> 00:00:40,740
HE DID WRITE THAT I AM 

21
00:00:40,740 --> 00:00:41,941
PASSIONED DISSENT IN THE 

22
00:00:41,941 --> 00:00:44,544
OBAMACARE CASE WHEN THE COURT 

23
00:00:44,544 --> 00:00:46,045
VOTE TODAY UPHOLD PRESIDENT 

24
00:00:46,045 --> 00:00:47,013
OBAMA'S SIGNATURE ACHIEVEMENT. 

25
00:00:47,013 --> 00:00:48,381
THE MESSAGE HERE AND THE TAKE 

26
00:00:48,381 --> 00:00:50,417
AWAY IS HE IS CONSIDERED A 

27
00:00:50,417 --> 00:00:50,717
SWING VOTE. 

28
00:00:50,717 --> 00:00:55,388
HE WAS THE KEY VOTE IN REFUSING 

29
00:00:55,388 --> 00:00:58,057
TO OVERTURN ROE VERSUS WADE. 

30
00:00:58,057 --> 00:01:00,493
HE WAS WITH LIBERALS ON A 

31
00:01:00,493 --> 00:01:01,494
NUMBER OF SOCIAL ISSUES. 

32
00:01:01,494 --> 00:01:03,430
IF NOT VOTING WITH LIBERALS ON 

33
00:01:03,430 --> 00:01:05,965
THE SOCIAL ISSUES, HE WOULD 

34
00:01:05,965 --> 00:01:09,002
SORT OF CONSTRAIN THE BOLDER 

35
00:01:09,002 --> 00:01:10,236
CONSERVATIVES ON THE COURT. 

36
00:01:10,236 --> 00:01:14,207
THEY MAY BE WILLING TO GO 

37
00:01:14,207 --> 00:01:14,574
FURTHER. 

38
00:01:14,574 --> 00:01:16,009
LET'S END AFFIRMATIVE ACTION 

39
00:01:16,009 --> 00:01:16,843
AND JUSTICE KENNEDY WAS THERE 

40
00:01:16,843 --> 00:01:19,746
PULLING THEM BACK A LITTLE BIT. 

41
00:01:19,746 --> 00:01:21,681
THE KEY TO UNDERSTANDING HIM, 

42
00:01:21,681 --> 00:01:22,314
MANY PEOPLE HAVE SPECULATED 

43
00:01:22,314 --> 00:01:24,350
THAT HE WOULD NEVER SAY NEVER 

44
00:01:24,350 --> 00:01:25,885
ON SOME OF THOSE SOCIAL ISSUES. 

45
00:01:25,885 --> 00:01:27,353
NOW WE WILL -- WE MAY WELL HAVE 

46
00:01:27,353 --> 00:01:29,923
A NOMINEE THAT IS WILLING TO BE 

47
00:01:29,923 --> 00:01:31,957
A LITTLE MORE BOLD. 

48
00:01:31,957 --> 00:01:34,093
>> SO, JEN, THE SCALIA SEAT WAS 

49
00:01:34,093 --> 00:01:35,027
OPEN FOR 14 MONTHS. 

50
00:01:35,027 --> 00:01:36,829
HOW LONG WOULD YOU EXPECT THIS 

51
00:01:36,829 --> 00:01:38,064
SEAT TO REMAIN VACANT FOR? 

52
00:01:38,064 --> 00:01:39,065
>> NOT THAT LONG. 

53
00:01:39,065 --> 00:01:42,368
I WOULD EXPECT YOU WILL SEE A 

54
00:01:42,368 --> 00:01:43,369
NEW JUSTICE NOMINATED BY 

55
00:01:43,369 --> 00:01:44,571
PRESIDENT TRUMP AND CONFIRMED 

56
00:01:44,571 --> 00:01:46,806
BY THE SENATE OVER THE SUMMER 

57
00:01:46,806 --> 00:01:48,508
AND IN PLACE TO HEAR ARGUMENTS 

58
00:01:48,508 --> 00:01:50,310
WHEN THE JUSTICES RETURN FROM 

59
00:01:50,310 --> 00:01:51,811
THEIR RECESS THE FIRST MONDAY 

60
00:01:51,811 --> 00:01:52,144
IN OCTOBER. 

61
00:01:52,144 --> 00:01:57,317
AND THERE WILL BE VERY LITTLE 

62
00:01:57,317 --> 00:02:00,185
DEMOCRATS CAN DO ABOUT IT. 

63
00:02:00,185 --> 00:02:00,486
>> OKAY. 

64
00:02:00,486 --> 00:02:01,921
JEN CRAWFORD FROM D.C. WE WILL 

65
00:02:01,921 --> 00:02:04,023

KENNEDY. 

72
00:02:12,632 --> 00:02:13,299
LONG, LONG A SWING VOTE. 

73
00:02:13,299 --> 00:02:15,735

THE NEWS FROM THE SUPREME COURT

00:02:26,779 --> 00:02:27,546
JUSTICE KENNEDY IS RETIRING.

TO CBSNEWS.COM. 

84
00:02:41,828 --> 00:02:42,829
>>> SHE IS A CONTRIBUTING 

85
00:02:42,829 --> 00:02:47,767
EDITOR AT NEWS WEEK AND A 

86
00:02:47,767 --> 00:02:48,501
SENIOR EDITOR AT SLATE. 

87
00:02:48,501 --> 00:02:49,569
DALIA, WHAT IS YOUR 

88
00:02:49,569 --> 00:02:51,304
INTERPRETATION OF THIS NEWS? 

89
00:02:51,304 --> 00:02:51,771
ARE YOU SURPRISED? 

90
00:02:51,771 --> 00:02:53,406
THERE WERE RUMORS THAT THE 

91
00:02:53,406 --> 00:02:53,906
JUSTICE MIGHT RETIRE. 

92
00:02:53,906 --> 00:02:54,173
>> YEAH. 

93
00:02:54,173 --> 00:02:55,975
I DON'T THINK IT WAS A 

94
00:02:55,975 --> 00:02:56,376
SURPRISE. 

95
00:02:56,376 --> 00:02:58,945
I THINK WE KNEW HE WANT TODAY 

96
00:02:58,945 --> 00:03:00,980
GO A YEAR AGO -- HE WANTED TO 

97
00:03:00,980 --> 00:03:02,649
GO A YEAR AGO. 

98
00:03:02,649 --> 00:03:05,918
WE WERE RAMPED UP, READY FOR 

99
00:03:05,918 --> 00:03:06,118
THAT. 

100
00:03:06,118 --> 00:03:07,720
THERE WERE A FEW ISSUES THAT HE 

101
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:09,923
WANT TODAY RESOLVE THAT HE HAD 

102
00:03:09,923 --> 00:03:10,890
BEEN THINKING ABOUT FOR 

103
00:03:10,890 --> 00:03:11,224
DECADES. 

104
00:03:11,224 --> 00:03:12,091
HE HUNG OUT TO RESOLVE THEM. 

105
00:03:12,091 --> 00:03:14,727
IT IS NOT A SURPRISE AT ALL. 

106
00:03:14,727 --> 00:03:15,127
HE IS 81. 

107
00:03:15,127 --> 00:03:16,195
IT IS FAIRLY CLEAR FROM HIS 

108
00:03:16,195 --> 00:03:17,230
DECISION THAT THE END OF THIS 

109
00:03:17,230 --> 00:03:20,266
TERM JUST IN THE LAST COUPLE OF 

110
00:03:20,266 --> 00:03:21,200
WEEKS THAT HE'S DONE WHAT HE 

111
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:24,237
NEEDS TO DO AND HE IS READY TO 

112
00:03:24,237 --> 00:03:24,437
GO. 

113
00:03:24,437 --> 00:03:26,372
SO I THINK IN SOME SENSE THE 

114
00:03:26,372 --> 00:03:27,774
SURPRISE WAS THAT HE STAYED A 

115
00:03:27,774 --> 00:03:29,709
YEAR BEYOND WHEN HE TOLD US HE 

116
00:03:29,709 --> 00:03:30,309
PRETTY MUCH WANTED TO GO. 

117
00:03:30,309 --> 00:03:34,647
>> WHAT DO YOU THINK WERE THOSE 

118
00:03:34,647 --> 00:03:36,582
UNRESOLVED ISSUES THAT HE 

119
00:03:36,582 --> 00:03:37,817
WANTED TO ADDRESS BEFORE 

120
00:03:37,817 --> 00:03:38,084
RETIRING? 

121
00:03:38,084 --> 00:03:40,520
>> INTERESTINGLY THE BIG ONE 

122
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:40,953
WAS GERRYMANDERING. 

123
00:03:40,953 --> 00:03:43,489
HE HAD BEEN WAITING FOR DECADES 

124
00:03:43,489 --> 00:03:45,959
TO FIND WHAT HE CALLED A 

125
00:03:45,959 --> 00:03:50,830
STANDARD FOR WHAT WOULD BE AN 

126
00:03:50,830 --> 00:03:51,363
UNCONSTITUTIONAL PARTISAN 

127
00:03:51,363 --> 00:03:51,697
GERRYMANDER. 

128
00:03:51,697 --> 00:03:52,865
AND INTERESTING IN THE GILL 

129
00:03:52,865 --> 00:03:54,834
CASE HE DECIDED NOT TO DECIDE. 

130
00:03:54,834 --> 00:03:56,903
HE HAD TWO VEHICLES THIS TERM 

131
00:03:56,903 --> 00:03:59,772
THAT COULD HAVE BEEN THAT. 

132
00:03:59,772 --> 00:04:00,773
THE COURT KICKED THOSE AWAY. 

133
00:04:00,773 --> 00:04:03,009
AND SO IF THAT'S THE THING THAT 

134
00:04:03,009 --> 00:04:04,877
HE WANTED TO GET SORTED AFTER 

135
00:04:04,877 --> 00:04:07,313
DECADES OF WAITING AND SEEING, 

136
00:04:07,313 --> 00:04:08,348
WAITING FOR THE PERFECT 

137
00:04:08,348 --> 00:04:09,949
VEHICLE, HE ACTUALLY DIDN'T GET 

138
00:04:09,949 --> 00:04:10,282
THAT DONE. 

139
00:04:10,282 --> 00:04:13,319
I ALSO THINK HE PROBABLY WANT 

140
00:04:13,319 --> 00:04:14,454
TODAY STAY ON -- WANTED TO TRY 

141
00:04:14,454 --> 00:04:16,622
TO STAY ON A YEAR TO RESOLVE 

142
00:04:16,622 --> 00:04:17,857
THE TRAVEL BAN THAT CAME DOWN 

143
00:04:17,857 --> 00:04:20,392
YESTERDAY AND HE WAS THE FIFTH 

144
00:04:20,392 --> 00:04:21,627
CRITICAL VOTE TO UPHOLD THE 

145
00:04:21,627 --> 00:04:21,927
TRAVEL BAN. 

146
00:04:21,927 --> 00:04:23,129
>> WE'RE GOING TO HOLD YOU 

147
00:04:23,129 --> 00:04:23,462
RIGHT THERE. 

148
00:04:23,462 --> 00:04:26,899
IF YOU COULD STAND BY FOR US. 

149
00:04:26,899 --> 00:04:32,472
WE'RE GOING TO BRING IN JAN 

150
00:04:32,472 --> 00:04:34,607
CRAWFORD JOINING US FROM 

151
00:04:34,607 --> 00:04:34,907
WASHINGTON. 

152
00:04:34,907 --> 00:04:35,441
NOT ENTIRELY A SURPRISE. 

153
00:04:35,441 --> 00:04:36,676
WHAT DOES THIS MEAN FOR THE 

154
00:04:36,676 --> 00:04:37,844
FUTURE OF THE COURT, GIVEN THE 

155
00:04:37,844 --> 00:04:40,246
FACT THAT HE WAS SUCH A 

156
00:04:40,246 --> 00:04:41,147
CRITICAL SWING VOTE. 

157
00:04:41,147 --> 00:04:43,016
>> WELL, I DON'T WANT TO 

158
00:04:43,016 --> 00:04:45,752
OVERSTATE THE IDEA THAT KENNEDY 

159
00:04:45,752 --> 00:04:46,753
WAS SOME MODERATE CONSERVATIVE, 

160
00:04:46,753 --> 00:04:47,987
YOU KNOW, WHO WAS KIND OF -- WE 

161
00:04:47,987 --> 00:04:48,988
NEVER KNEW WHAT HE WAS GOING TO 

162
00:04:48,988 --> 00:04:49,288
DO. 

163
00:04:49,288 --> 00:04:52,992
AT THE END OF THE DAY, HE WAS A 

164
00:04:52,992 --> 00:04:53,325
CONSERVATIVE. 

165
00:04:53,325 --> 00:04:54,494
BUT HE HAD THAT LIBERTARIAN 

166
00:04:54,494 --> 00:04:54,727
STREAK. 

167
00:04:54,727 --> 00:04:56,195
SO HE MADE A NUMBER OF KEY 

168
00:04:56,195 --> 00:05:00,566
RULINGS ON SOME OF THE SOCIAL 

169
00:05:00,566 --> 00:05:01,667
ISSUES, SIDING WITH LIBERALS. 

170
00:05:01,667 --> 00:05:03,369
SO AS A RESULT, YOU SAW HIM 

171
00:05:03,369 --> 00:05:04,904
VOTING AS HE DID ON ABORTION 

172
00:05:04,904 --> 00:05:06,339
AND GAY RIGHTS AND HE WOULD 

173
00:05:06,339 --> 00:05:08,140
RESTRAIN SOME OF THE BOLDER 

174
00:05:08,140 --> 00:05:08,507
CONSERVATIVES. 

175
00:05:08,507 --> 00:05:09,709
I DON'T THINK WE'RE GOING TO 

176
00:05:09,709 --> 00:05:10,977
GET A NOMINEE WHO IS LIKE THAT. 

177
00:05:10,977 --> 00:05:12,645
I THINK PRESIDENT TRUMP IS 

178
00:05:12,645 --> 00:05:14,513
GOING TO PUT ON A STRONG 

179
00:05:14,513 --> 00:05:16,049
CONSERVATIVE, SOMEONE WHO IS IN 

180
00:05:16,049 --> 00:05:19,118
THE MOLD OF A JUSTICE SCALIA OR 

181
00:05:19,118 --> 00:05:19,585
NOW A JUSTICE THOMAS. 

182
00:05:19,585 --> 00:05:21,487
THAT IS WHAT HE IS GOING TO BE 

183
00:05:21,487 --> 00:05:21,820
LOOKING FOR. 

184
00:05:21,820 --> 00:05:23,556
THOSE ARE ALL OF THE NOMINEES 

185
00:05:23,556 --> 00:05:25,091
ALREADY WE BELIEVE WHO ARE ON 

186
00:05:25,091 --> 00:05:25,724
THE SHORT LIST THAT. 

187
00:05:25,724 --> 00:05:27,360
WILL CHANGE THE SUPREME COURT. 

188
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:28,628
IT WILL MOVE THE COURT MORE 

189
00:05:28,628 --> 00:05:30,062
SOLIDLY TO THE RIGHT FOR A 

190
00:05:30,062 --> 00:05:32,398
GENERATION. 

191
00:05:32,398 --> 00:05:34,033
>> HOW EASILY AND QUICKLY DO 

192
00:05:34,033 --> 00:05:36,135
YOU THINK A JUSTICE WILL BE 

193
00:05:36,135 --> 00:05:37,837
CONFIRMED, A NOMINEE WILL BE 

194
00:05:37,837 --> 00:05:39,672
CONFIRMED, ESPECIALLY GIVEN 

195
00:05:39,672 --> 00:05:41,941
WHAT HAPPENED LAST TIME WHEN -- 

196
00:05:41,941 --> 00:05:44,043
WHEN SENATE DEMOCRATS TRIED TO 

197
00:05:44,043 --> 00:05:44,410
BLOCK GORSUCH. 

198
00:05:44,410 --> 00:05:46,979
>> I THINK IT WILL BE VERY EASY 

199
00:05:46,979 --> 00:05:49,015
TO GET A NOMINEE CONFIRMED AND 

200
00:05:49,015 --> 00:05:49,949
IT WILL HAPPEN QUICKLY. 

201
00:05:49,949 --> 00:05:52,118
THERE IS NOTHING THAT DEMOCRATS 

202
00:05:52,118 --> 00:05:52,485
CAN DO IT. 

203
00:05:52,485 --> 00:05:56,355
THEY MADE THE DECISION TO 

204
00:05:56,355 --> 00:05:57,556
FILIBUSTER NEIL GORSUCH WHO WAS 

205
00:05:57,556 --> 00:06:00,359
REPLACING SCALIA ON THE SUPREME 

206
00:06:00,359 --> 00:06:00,693
COURT. 

207
00:06:00,693 --> 00:06:01,994
THAT ENABLED MITCH MCCONNELL, 

208
00:06:01,994 --> 00:06:03,529
THE SENATE MAJORITY LEADER, TO 

209
00:06:03,529 --> 00:06:05,865
KIND OF BLOW UP THE FILIBUSTER 

210
00:06:05,865 --> 00:06:07,366
WITH REPUBLICANS ON BOARD, EVEN 

211
00:06:07,366 --> 00:06:08,033
MODERATE REPUBLICANS ON BOARD. 

212
00:06:08,033 --> 00:06:10,470
I DON'T THINK IT WOULD HAVE 

213
00:06:10,470 --> 00:06:12,705
BEEN AS EASY TO BLOW UP THE 

214
00:06:12,705 --> 00:06:13,472
FILIBUSTER FOR THIS NOMINEE. 

215
00:06:13,472 --> 00:06:15,274
WHAT WE'RE GOING TO SEE IS THIS 

216
00:06:15,274 --> 00:06:16,642
NOMINATION IS GOING TO TURN ON 

217
00:06:16,642 --> 00:06:19,245
THE -- KIND OF THE HANDS OF THE 

218
00:06:19,245 --> 00:06:20,245
MODERATE CONSERVATIVES WHO ARE 

219
00:06:20,245 --> 00:06:23,983
IN THE SENATE F IT IS OKAY WITH 

220
00:06:23,983 --> 00:06:25,451
SUZANNE COLINS, THAT IS WHO THE 

221
00:06:25,451 --> 00:06:26,953
NOMINEE IS GOING TO BE. 

222
00:06:26,953 --> 00:06:28,020
THEY'RE GOING TO BE RESTRAINING 

223
00:06:28,020 --> 00:06:29,789
VOICES FOR THIS NOMINATION, NOT 

224
00:06:29,789 --> 00:06:30,390
THE DEMOCRATS. 

225
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:31,391
>> DO YOU EXPECT THIS 

226
00:06:31,391 --> 00:06:33,225
CONFIRMATION TO HAPPEN BEFORE 

227
00:06:33,225 --> 00:06:34,594
THE MID TERMS, BEFORE -- 

228
00:06:34,594 --> 00:06:34,827
>> YES. 

229
00:06:34,827 --> 00:06:37,663
>> MORE DEMOCRATS MAY COME IN? 

230
00:06:37,663 --> 00:06:37,930
>> YES. 

231
00:06:37,930 --> 00:06:38,231
ABSOLUTELY. 

232
00:06:38,231 --> 00:06:40,233
WE CAN SAY THAT WITH CERTAINTY. 

233
00:06:40,233 --> 00:06:42,435
AND I DO BELIEVE YOU WILL HAVE 

234
00:06:42,435 --> 00:06:43,536
A NEW JUSTICE ON THE SUPREME 

235
00:06:43,536 --> 00:06:46,872
COURT FOR THE FIRST MONDAY IN 

236
00:06:46,872 --> 00:06:47,306
OCTOBER. 

237
00:06:47,306 --> 00:06:49,375
>> JAN CRAWFORD, THANK YOU SO 

238
00:06:49,375 --> 00:06:49,608
MUCH. 

239
00:06:49,608 --> 00:06:50,576
MAJOR GARRETT JOINS US NOW FROM 

240
00:06:50,576 --> 00:06:52,345
THE NORTH LAWN OF THE WHITE 

241
00:06:52,345 --> 00:06:52,578
HOUSE. 

242
00:06:52,578 --> 00:06:54,280
MAJOR, THE PRESIDENT WILL NOW 

243
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:55,815
HAVE A CHANCE TO NOMINATE A 

244
00:06:55,815 --> 00:06:58,050
SECOND JUSTICE TO THE COURT. 

245
00:06:58,050 --> 00:06:59,452
HOW SIGNIFICANT IS THIS, 

246
00:06:59,452 --> 00:07:00,786
ESPECIALLY GIVEN WHAT HAPPENED 

247
00:07:00,786 --> 00:07:03,689
DURING THE GORSUCH NOMINATION? 

248
00:07:03,689 --> 00:07:05,224
>> WELL, IT IS ENORMOUSLY 

249
00:07:05,224 --> 00:07:05,591
SIGNIFICANT. 

250
00:07:05,591 --> 00:07:07,293
ONE OF THE MOST SIGNIFICANT 

251
00:07:07,293 --> 00:07:09,061
POWER THAT'S ANY PRESIDENT 

252
00:07:09,061 --> 00:07:09,429
POSSESSES. 

253
00:07:09,429 --> 00:07:11,431
WITH NEIL GORSUCH, PRESIDENT 

254
00:07:11,431 --> 00:07:18,638
TRUMP INDICATED THAT HE WOULD 

255
00:07:18,638 --> 00:07:20,573
LOOK FOR CONSERVATIVE 

256
00:07:20,573 --> 00:07:21,574
JURORRISTS IN THE MOLD OF 

257
00:07:21,574 --> 00:07:21,807
SCALIA. 

258
00:07:21,807 --> 00:07:25,111
BE THAT PERSON A MAN OR A 

259
00:07:25,111 --> 00:07:25,411
WOMAN. 

260
00:07:25,411 --> 00:07:26,512
AND AS JAN ACCURATELY 

261
00:07:26,512 --> 00:07:28,147
SUMMARIZED JUST A SECOND AGO, 

262
00:07:28,147 --> 00:07:30,116
THAT NOMINEE IS LIKELY TO 

263
00:07:30,116 --> 00:07:31,550
RECEIVE A VERY FAVORABLE 

264
00:07:31,550 --> 00:07:33,386
EMBRACE BY THE SENATE 

265
00:07:33,386 --> 00:07:35,455
REPUBLICAN LEADERSHIP AND THE 

266
00:07:35,455 --> 00:07:36,422
SENATE REPUBLICAN RANK AND 

267
00:07:36,422 --> 00:07:36,789
FILE. 

268
00:07:36,789 --> 00:07:37,790
THOSE CONFIRMATION HEARINGS 

269
00:07:37,790 --> 00:07:38,658
WILL BE SCHEDULED RAPIDLY. 

270
00:07:38,658 --> 00:07:40,793
THEY WILL BE CONDUCTED AND A 

271
00:07:40,793 --> 00:07:43,563
VOTE WILL BE HELD IN THE MID 

272
00:07:43,563 --> 00:07:45,097
TERM ELECTION ATMOSPHERE. 

273
00:07:45,097 --> 00:07:46,332
THAT WILL HAVE TWO 

274
00:07:46,332 --> 00:07:46,665
CONSEQUENCES. 

275
00:07:46,665 --> 00:07:47,199
BOTH OF THEM POLITICAL. 

276
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:49,268
WE WILL GET TO THE LEGAL 

277
00:07:49,268 --> 00:07:49,868
CONSEQUENCES IN A SECOND. 

278
00:07:49,868 --> 00:07:53,472
BUT THE POLITICS OF THIS IS 

279
00:07:53,472 --> 00:07:54,005
EXTREMELY IMPORTANT. 

280
00:07:54,005 --> 00:07:57,477
THE SECOND TRUMP NOMINEE TO THE 

281
00:07:57,477 --> 00:07:59,946
HIGH COURT WILL BE A 

282
00:07:59,946 --> 00:08:01,948
GALVANIZING CALL TO REPUBLICANS 

283
00:08:01,948 --> 00:08:03,149
TO SUPPORT REPUBLICANS ON THE 

284
00:08:03,149 --> 00:08:05,151
BALLOT IN SENATE AND HOUSE 

285
00:08:05,151 --> 00:08:06,518
RACES IN THE MID TERMS. 

286
00:08:06,518 --> 00:08:09,555
THIS IS IN ESSENCE FROM JUSTICE 

287
00:08:09,555 --> 00:08:12,024
KENNEDY A POLITICAL GIFT TO THE 

288
00:08:12,024 --> 00:08:13,859
REPUBLICAN PARTY AND PRESIDENT 

289
00:08:13,859 --> 00:08:14,092
TRUMP. 

290
00:08:14,092 --> 00:08:17,797
BECAUSE ONE ISSUE HAS BEEN A 

291
00:08:17,797 --> 00:08:18,931
GALVANIZING AND MOTIVATING 

292
00:08:18,931 --> 00:08:19,632
COMPONENT FOR BASE REPUBLICANS 

293
00:08:19,632 --> 00:08:19,932
THROUGHOUT. 

294
00:08:19,932 --> 00:08:21,634
AND IT HAS BEEN THE FUTURE OF 

295
00:08:21,634 --> 00:08:24,303
THE SUPREME COURT, THE FUTURE 

296
00:08:24,303 --> 00:08:25,137
OF THE FEDERAL BENCH GENERALLY. 

297
00:08:25,137 --> 00:08:27,039
PRESIDENT TRUMP REFERS TO IT 

298
00:08:27,039 --> 00:08:27,339
REPEATEDLY. 

299
00:08:27,339 --> 00:08:29,942
IT WAS A SIGNIFICANT ASPECT OF 

300
00:08:29,942 --> 00:08:30,943
HIS VICTORY IN 2016. 

301
00:08:30,943 --> 00:08:32,979
IF YOU LOOK AT THE EXIT POLLING 

302
00:08:32,979 --> 00:08:35,481
DATA ABOUT HOW MANY TRUMP 

303
00:08:35,481 --> 00:08:36,448
SUPPORTERS IDENTIFIED THE 

304
00:08:36,448 --> 00:08:37,650
SUPREME COURT AS THE MOST 

305
00:08:37,650 --> 00:08:40,019
IMPORTANT OR AMONG THE MOST 

306
00:08:40,019 --> 00:08:41,587
IMPORTANT ISSUES, THOSE NUMBERS 

307
00:08:41,587 --> 00:08:43,289
DEPENDING ON THE STATE RANGED 

308
00:08:43,289 --> 00:08:45,891
FROM 20 TO 25 IN SOME CASES 

309
00:08:45,891 --> 00:08:46,091
30%. 

310
00:08:46,091 --> 00:08:48,327
IT WAS A BIG MOTIVATING FACTOR 

311
00:08:48,327 --> 00:08:48,661
THEN. 

312
00:08:48,661 --> 00:08:49,328
IT WILL BE IN 2018. 

313
00:08:49,328 --> 00:08:51,731
ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE 

314
00:08:51,731 --> 00:08:53,966
POLITICAL AISLE, WE HAVE KIND 

315
00:08:53,966 --> 00:08:56,035
OF A CONSTELLATION OF LEGAL 

316
00:08:56,035 --> 00:08:57,369
ISSUES LATELY THAT HAVE GRABBED 

317
00:08:57,369 --> 00:08:58,604
THE ATTENTION OF DEMOCRATS AND 

318
00:08:58,604 --> 00:09:00,940
THE FUTURE OF THE SUPREME COURT 

319
00:09:00,940 --> 00:09:02,808
WILL MOTIVATE THEM EVEN MORE. 

320
00:09:02,808 --> 00:09:04,043
THERE WILL BE TREMENDOUS 

321
00:09:04,043 --> 00:09:07,279
PRESSURE ON DEMOCRATS TO DO 

322
00:09:07,279 --> 00:09:09,482
WHAT THEY CAN TO RESIST AND 

323
00:09:09,482 --> 00:09:11,584
THEY WILL PROBABLY FAIL IN THAT 

324
00:09:11,584 --> 00:09:13,786
RESISTANCE T WILL BE USED IN 

325
00:09:13,786 --> 00:09:15,221
THE MID TERMS FOR VOTERS LOOK 

326
00:09:15,221 --> 00:09:17,957
AT WHAT IS HAPPENING TO THE 

327
00:09:17,957 --> 00:09:18,624
LEGAL CONSTRUCT OF OUR COUNTRY. 

328
00:09:18,624 --> 00:09:20,059
LOOK AT WHAT IS GOING ON. 

329
00:09:20,059 --> 00:09:20,960
YOU'VE GOT TO VOTE DEMOCRAT IF 

330
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:24,864
YOU WANT TO SLOW THAT DOWN AND 

331
00:09:24,864 --> 00:09:25,631
YOU'VE GOT TO THINK MORE 

332
00:09:25,631 --> 00:09:26,999
HOLISTICALLY, IF YOU WILL, 

333
00:09:26,999 --> 00:09:29,335
ABOUT THE FUTURE OF THE FEDERAL 

334
00:09:29,335 --> 00:09:31,137
BENCH IN NOT JUST MID TERM 

335
00:09:31,137 --> 00:09:34,907
ELECTIONS IN 2018 BUT FOR THE 

336
00:09:34,907 --> 00:09:36,175
PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION IN 2020. 

337
00:09:36,175 --> 00:09:37,209
SO ONE THING THAT JAN KNOWS ALL 

338
00:09:37,209 --> 00:09:39,545
TOO WELL IS THAT THE COURT 

339
00:09:39,545 --> 00:09:45,418
ITSELF AND ITS FUTURE IS NO 

340
00:09:45,418 --> 00:09:46,719
LONGER LIMITED TO DEBATES ABOUT 

341
00:09:46,719 --> 00:09:49,055
LEGALISMS, PRECEDENT AND ALL OF 

342
00:09:49,055 --> 00:09:51,657
THOSE SORTS OF OTHER LEGAL 

343
00:09:51,657 --> 00:09:52,024
TERMS. 

344
00:09:52,024 --> 00:09:54,459
IT IS ALSO ABOUT POLITICS. 

345
00:09:54,459 --> 00:09:55,628
MOTIVATIONAL POLITICS, BASE 

346
00:09:55,628 --> 00:09:57,629
POLITICS ON BOTH SIDES. 

347
00:09:57,629 --> 00:10:00,132
AND JUSTICE KENNEDY'S ANNOUNCED 

348
00:10:00,132 --> 00:10:01,100
RETIREMENT WILL BE A 

349
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:02,234
GALVANIZING FORCE FOR 

350
00:10:02,234 --> 00:10:03,502
REPUBLICANS AND DEMOCRATS IN 

351
00:10:03,502 --> 00:10:04,503
THE MID TERM ELECTIONS. 

352
00:10:04,503 --> 00:10:06,504
>> HOW MUCH WILL THIS VALIDATE 

353
00:10:06,504 --> 00:10:07,239
THE PRESIDENT HIMSELF? 

354
00:10:07,239 --> 00:10:08,040
WE SAW YESTERDAY WHEN THE 

355
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:10,042
SUPREME COURT SIDED WITH THE 

356
00:10:10,042 --> 00:10:12,111
PRESIDENT ON THE TRAVEL BAN. 

357
00:10:12,111 --> 00:10:13,946
THAT REALLY PUMPED THE 

358
00:10:13,946 --> 00:10:16,515
PRESIDENT UP IN TERMS OF HIS -- 

359
00:10:16,515 --> 00:10:19,151
HIS BELIEF THAT HE WAS RIGHT 

360
00:10:19,151 --> 00:10:19,451
ALL ALONG. 

361
00:10:19,451 --> 00:10:20,820
IF WE HAVE ANOTHER JUSTICE THAT 

362
00:10:20,820 --> 00:10:23,255
WAS NOMINATED BY THE PRESIDENT 

363
00:10:23,255 --> 00:10:25,824
ON THE BENCH WHO MAY SIDE WITH 

364
00:10:25,824 --> 00:10:28,194
THE PRESIDENT, OF COURSE EACH 

365
00:10:28,194 --> 00:10:29,862
JUSTICE LOOKS AT THE LEGAL 

366
00:10:29,862 --> 00:10:30,662
CONSTRAINTS ON EACH DECISION. 

367
00:10:30,662 --> 00:10:32,531
BUT IF WE SEE ANOTHER NOMINEE, 

368
00:10:32,531 --> 00:10:34,066
ANOTHER JUSTICE ON THE BENCH 

369
00:10:34,066 --> 00:10:35,401
THAT WAS NOMINATED BY THE 

370
00:10:35,401 --> 00:10:37,970
PRESIDENT, HOW WILL THAT AFFECT 

371
00:10:37,970 --> 00:10:40,039
THE PRESIDENT HIMSELF AND HIS 

372
00:10:40,039 --> 00:10:42,608
-- HIS FEELING OF HIS -- 

373
00:10:42,608 --> 00:10:44,744
FEELING BEHIND HIS OWN 

374
00:10:44,744 --> 00:10:45,044
DECISIONS? 

375
00:10:45,044 --> 00:10:48,547
>> WELL, THE TRAVEL BAN, IT IS 

376
00:10:48,547 --> 00:10:50,116
IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER, WAS 

377
00:10:50,116 --> 00:10:52,151
OKAYED BY THE SUPREME COURT IN 

378
00:10:52,151 --> 00:10:52,651
ITS THIRD VARIATION. 

379
00:10:52,651 --> 00:10:54,553
I DON'T THINK IT IS CLEAR BASED 

380
00:10:54,553 --> 00:10:56,355
ON READING THE COURT'S 

381
00:10:56,355 --> 00:10:58,089
DECISION, EVEN BY THAT NARROW 5-

382
00:10:58,089 --> 00:10:59,892
4 MAJORITY OPINION, THAT WOULD 

383
00:10:59,892 --> 00:11:01,694
HAVE BEEN AN ENDORSEMENT FROM 

384
00:11:01,694 --> 00:11:04,096
THE SUPREME COURT'S POINT OF 

385
00:11:04,096 --> 00:11:05,464
VIEW CONSTITUTIONALLY OF EITHER 

386
00:11:05,464 --> 00:11:07,967
TRAVEL BAN 2 OR TRAVEL BAN 1. 

387
00:11:07,967 --> 00:11:09,769
SO THE PRESIDENT HAD TO 

388
00:11:09,769 --> 00:11:10,770
SIGNIFICANTLY ALTER HIS 

389
00:11:10,770 --> 00:11:12,471
ORIENTATION TO THAT ISSUE TO 

390
00:11:12,471 --> 00:11:13,038
WIN SUPREME COURT APPROVAL. 

391
00:11:13,038 --> 00:11:14,039
THAT IS OF COURSE WHY THEY DID 

392
00:11:14,039 --> 00:11:17,610
IT. 

393
00:11:17,610 --> 00:11:19,512
SO THAT IS ALWAYS SOMETHING 

394
00:11:19,512 --> 00:11:21,747
WORTH UNDERSCORING IN THE 

395
00:11:21,747 --> 00:11:22,180
TRAVEL BAN CASE. 

396
00:11:22,180 --> 00:11:24,116
YES, IT WAS VINDICATION BUT IT 

397
00:11:24,116 --> 00:11:24,917
CAME AFTER THE THIRD VARIATION, 

398
00:11:24,917 --> 00:11:26,552
TRYING TO INTERPRET WHAT THE 

399
00:11:26,552 --> 00:11:27,353
PRESIDENT WANT TODAY 

400
00:11:27,353 --> 00:11:27,720
ACCOMPLISH. 

401
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:29,421
LOOK, THE PRESIDENT'S POINT OF 

402
00:11:29,421 --> 00:11:33,392
VIEW ABOUT THE SUPREME COURT IS 

403
00:11:33,392 --> 00:11:36,629
VERY MUCH CONSISTENT WITH THAT 

404
00:11:36,629 --> 00:11:37,797
OF JUDICIAL CONSERVATIVES WHO 

405
00:11:37,797 --> 00:11:39,732
WANT JURISTS ON THE FEDERAL 

406
00:11:39,732 --> 00:11:41,133
BENCH, AT THE DISTRICT COURT 

407
00:11:41,133 --> 00:11:42,001
LEVEL, THE APPEAL AT COURT 

408
00:11:42,001 --> 00:11:44,370
LEVEL AND THE SUPREME COURT 

409
00:11:44,370 --> 00:11:47,773
THAT HAVE A NARROW 

410
00:11:47,773 --> 00:11:48,774
INTERPRETATION OF 

411
00:11:48,774 --> 00:11:49,341
CONSTITUTIONAL EVOLUTION. 

412
00:11:49,341 --> 00:11:50,776
THEY WANT THINGS CONSISTENT 

413
00:11:50,776 --> 00:11:52,411
WITH PRECEDENT BUT THEY'RE NOT 

414
00:11:52,411 --> 00:11:53,879
INTERESTED NEXT PANNING THE 

415
00:11:53,879 --> 00:11:57,717
REACH OR DEFINITIONS OF WHAT IS 

416
00:11:57,717 --> 00:11:58,951
LEGAL UNDER THE CONSTITUTION. 

417
00:11:58,951 --> 00:12:00,352
INTRODUCING NEW PROTECTED 

418
00:12:00,352 --> 00:12:01,987
CLASSES OR NEW PROTECTED 

419
00:12:01,987 --> 00:12:02,521
BEHAVIORS. 

420
00:12:02,521 --> 00:12:04,523
THEY WANT TO BE VERY 

421
00:12:04,523 --> 00:12:04,856
CONSTRAINED. 

422
00:12:04,856 --> 00:12:06,492
AND AS CLOSE AS POSSIBLE AS 

423
00:12:06,492 --> 00:12:08,427
THEY WOULD ARGUE IT TO THE 

424
00:12:08,427 --> 00:12:09,495
ORIGINAL -- WHAT THEY CALL THE 

425
00:12:09,495 --> 00:12:11,764
ORIGIN TENT OF THE 

426
00:12:11,764 --> 00:12:12,631
CONSTITUTION. 

427
00:12:12,631 --> 00:12:13,766
THAT IS THE PRESIDENT'S 

428
00:12:13,766 --> 00:12:14,066
FRAMEWORK. 

429
00:12:14,066 --> 00:12:16,235
HE HAS, IF YOU WILL, 

430
00:12:16,235 --> 00:12:18,971
SUBCONTRACTED MOST OF THAT WORK 

431
00:12:18,971 --> 00:12:19,772
TO SOMETHING CALLED THE 

432
00:12:19,772 --> 00:12:20,906
FEDERALIST SOCIETY WHICH HAS 

433
00:12:20,906 --> 00:12:22,908
BEEN IN WASHINGTON FOR MORE 

434
00:12:22,908 --> 00:12:23,576
THAN 30 YEARS. 

435
00:12:23,576 --> 00:12:24,810
JAN IS VERY FAMILIAR WITH IT, 

436
00:12:24,810 --> 00:12:26,711
AS ARE THE LEGAL EXPERTS IN 

437
00:12:26,711 --> 00:12:27,012
WASHINGTON. 

438
00:12:27,012 --> 00:12:30,416
THEY HAVE THIS VIEW, THEY HAVE 

439
00:12:30,416 --> 00:12:32,418
SPENT 30 YEARS QUIETLY 

440
00:12:32,418 --> 00:12:34,553
CONSISTENTLY AT LAW SCHOOLS, ON 

441
00:12:34,553 --> 00:12:35,955
FEDERAL BENCHES, ON STATE 

442
00:12:35,955 --> 00:12:37,656
BENCHES TRYING TO RECRUIT THOSE 

443
00:12:37,656 --> 00:12:39,492
WHO HAVE A LIKE MINDED APPROACH 

444
00:12:39,492 --> 00:12:40,192
TO THE LAW AND THE 

445
00:12:40,192 --> 00:12:43,095
CONSTITUTION. 

446
00:12:43,095 --> 00:12:44,430
THIS ORGANIZATION, THE 

447
00:12:44,430 --> 00:12:45,331
FEDERALIST SOCIETY, HAS NOW 

448
00:12:45,331 --> 00:12:49,268
PROVIDED MANY, IF NOT MOST OF 

449
00:12:49,268 --> 00:12:51,237
THE NAMES SUBMIT TODAY THIS 

450
00:12:51,237 --> 00:12:52,271
WHITE HOUSE FOR NOMINATION 

451
00:12:52,271 --> 00:12:54,039
EITHER TO LOWER FEDERAL COURT 

452
00:12:54,039 --> 00:12:54,873
APPOINTMENTS AND NOMINATIONS OR 

453
00:12:54,873 --> 00:12:57,576
TO THE HIGH COURT. 

454
00:12:57,576 --> 00:13:01,347
AND THE PRESIDENT, PRESIDENT 

455
00:13:01,347 --> 00:13:03,015
TRUMP, HAS ESSENTIALLY INVESTED 

456
00:13:03,015 --> 00:13:04,049
THIS GROUP ALMOST SOLELY WITH 

457
00:13:04,049 --> 00:13:07,353
THE POWER TO JUDGE WHO IS AND 

458
00:13:07,353 --> 00:13:09,054
WHO IS NOT SUITABLE FOR 

459
00:13:09,054 --> 00:13:11,690
NOMINATION BY THIS WHITE HOUSE. 

460
00:13:11,690 --> 00:13:15,194
IT IS NOT A DIRECT CONDUIT FROM 

461
00:13:15,194 --> 00:13:16,629
THE FEDERALIST SOCIETY TO THE 

462
00:13:16,629 --> 00:13:20,299
FEDERAL BENCH, BUT IT IS A VERY 

463
00:13:20,299 --> 00:13:20,766
INFLUENTIAL CONDUIT. 

464
00:13:20,766 --> 00:13:21,834
AND THAT ORGANIZATION WILL HAVE 

465
00:13:21,834 --> 00:13:24,236
A GREAT DEAL OF INFLUENCE ON 

466
00:13:24,236 --> 00:13:26,939
SHAPING THOSE ON THE SHORT LIST 

467
00:13:26,939 --> 00:13:28,007
FOR THE SUPREME COURT VACANCY 

468
00:13:28,007 --> 00:13:31,410
AND WHOEVER IT IS THE PRESIDENT 

469
00:13:31,410 --> 00:13:32,511
ULTIMATELY NOMINATES. 

470
00:13:32,511 --> 00:13:33,445
>> SPEAKING OF THAT SHORT LIST, 

471
00:13:33,445 --> 00:13:34,613
THE PRESIDENT HAS JUST SAID 

472
00:13:34,613 --> 00:13:36,549
WHILE APPEARING WITH THE 

473
00:13:36,549 --> 00:13:37,383
PRESIDENT OF PORTUGAL THAT HE 

474
00:13:37,383 --> 00:13:38,584
WILL IMMEDIATELY BEGIN THE 

475
00:13:38,584 --> 00:13:41,520
SEARCH FOR A NEW SUPREME COURT 

476
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:42,021
JUSTICE. 

477
00:13:42,021 --> 00:13:44,423
HE SAID THAT PERSON WILL COME 

478
00:13:44,423 --> 00:13:46,224
FROM THE PREVIOUSLY RELEASED 

479
00:13:46,224 --> 00:13:46,724
LIST OF 25 CANDIDATES. 

480
00:13:46,724 --> 00:13:48,794
WHAT DO WE KNOW ABOUT THIS LIST 

481
00:13:48,794 --> 00:13:50,162
AND WHO IS ON IT, MAJOR? 

482
00:13:50,162 --> 00:13:52,031
>> WELL, YOU CAN EASILY FIND T 

483
00:13:52,031 --> 00:13:55,134
I CAN'T GIVE YOU ALL 25 NAMES. 

484
00:13:55,134 --> 00:13:56,768
IT IS EASILY LOCATEABLE. 

485
00:13:56,768 --> 00:13:57,335
JUST GOOGLE IT. 

486
00:13:57,335 --> 00:13:59,204
WHAT IS IMPORTANT ABOUT THE 

487
00:13:59,204 --> 00:14:01,740
LIST IS THAT IT IS THE THIRD 

488
00:14:01,740 --> 00:14:03,242
VARIATION OF A LIST THAT 

489
00:14:03,242 --> 00:14:04,810
CANDIDATE TRUMP PROPOUNDED 

490
00:14:04,810 --> 00:14:05,443
DURING THE CAMPAIGN. 

491
00:14:05,443 --> 00:14:10,849
AND IT WAS A NOVELTY. 

492
00:14:10,849 --> 00:14:12,151
IT WAS BRAND-NEW FOR SOMEONE TO 

493
00:14:12,151 --> 00:14:13,485
SAY I'M DEVELOPING A LIST FOR 

494
00:14:13,485 --> 00:14:13,852
SUPREME COURT. 

495
00:14:13,852 --> 00:14:16,188
AS THE SECOND LIST CAME OUT, 

496
00:14:16,188 --> 00:14:17,122
THAT CANDIDATE, DONALD TRUMP, 

497
00:14:17,122 --> 00:14:18,457
UNLIKE ANYONE FOR EITHER PARTY 

498
00:14:18,457 --> 00:14:19,458
SAID THAT'S THE LIST. 

499
00:14:19,458 --> 00:14:21,159
I WILL PICO OWE IF I'M ELECTED, 

500
00:14:21,159 --> 00:14:22,728
I WILL PICK FROM THAT LIST AND 

501
00:14:22,728 --> 00:14:25,063
I WILL INTRODUCE NOBODY ELSE. 

502
00:14:25,063 --> 00:14:27,265
SO YOU CAN APPRAISE ME AS A 

503
00:14:27,265 --> 00:14:28,267
POTENTIAL PRESIDENT AND THE 

504
00:14:28,267 --> 00:14:29,969
SUPREME COURT BASED ON THIS 

505
00:14:29,969 --> 00:14:31,770
LIST I'M GIVING YOU TO 

506
00:14:31,770 --> 00:14:32,571
EVALUATE. 

507
00:14:32,571 --> 00:14:34,840
THAT WAS A SIGNAL DURING THE 

508
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:37,176
CAMPAIGN FROM DONALD TRUMP TO 

509
00:14:37,176 --> 00:14:38,943
JUDICIAL CONSERVATIVES AND ALL 

510
00:14:38,943 --> 00:14:39,611
REPUBLICAN MINDED VOTERS WHO 

511
00:14:39,611 --> 00:14:40,880
CARED ABOUT THE FUTURE OF THE 

512
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:42,948
SUPREME COURT, HERE IS MY LIST. 

513
00:14:42,948 --> 00:14:43,782
I'M TAKING IT SERIOUSLY. 

514
00:14:43,782 --> 00:14:44,683
I VETTED THIS LIST. 

515
00:14:44,683 --> 00:14:45,551
YOU CAN VET THE LIST. 

516
00:14:45,551 --> 00:14:48,721
AND IF YOU LIKE IT, MAYBE YOU 

517
00:14:48,721 --> 00:14:50,122
WILL SUPPORT ME. 

518
00:14:50,122 --> 00:14:52,924
IT WAS AN INNOVATIVE APPROACH 

519
00:14:52,924 --> 00:14:53,759
TO COMBINING POLITICS AND THE 

520
00:14:53,759 --> 00:14:55,861
FUTURE OF THE SUPREME COURT. 

521
00:14:55,861 --> 00:14:57,129
AND IT WORKED. 

522
00:14:57,129 --> 00:14:59,698
AND FROM THAT LIST, THE 

523
00:14:59,698 --> 00:15:01,000
PRESIDENT HAS DEVELOPED 

524
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,634
CREDIBILITY ON THIS ISSUE WITH 

525
00:15:02,634 --> 00:15:04,069
THE BASE REPUBLICAN VOTERS. 

526
00:15:04,069 --> 00:15:06,071
THAT LIST IS A REINFORCING 

527
00:15:06,071 --> 00:15:06,739
MECHANISM IN HIS CONVERSATION 

528
00:15:06,739 --> 00:15:08,339
WITH HIM ABOUT THE FUTURE OF 

529
00:15:08,339 --> 00:15:08,773
THE COURT. 

530
00:15:08,773 --> 00:15:10,642
LIKE I SAID, YOU CAN FIND ALL 

531
00:15:10,642 --> 00:15:11,877
25 NAMES ONLINE THAT. 

532
00:15:11,877 --> 00:15:13,278
IS EASY TO DO. 

533
00:15:13,278 --> 00:15:15,814
THE MORE IMPORTANT THING IS 

534
00:15:15,814 --> 00:15:16,482
THIS LIST IS REAL. 

535
00:15:16,482 --> 00:15:18,717
IT HAS BEEN THE WELL SPRING 

536
00:15:18,717 --> 00:15:21,320
FROM WHICH THE PRESIDENT HAS 

537
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:22,421
CHOSEN NOT JUST NEIL GORSUCH 

538
00:15:22,421 --> 00:15:24,156
BUT OTHERS TO THE HIGH POSITION 

539
00:15:24,156 --> 00:15:24,823
ON THE FEDERAL BENCH. 

540
00:15:24,823 --> 00:15:26,925
IT IS PART AND PARCEL OF WHAT 

541
00:15:26,925 --> 00:15:28,994
THEN CANDIDATE CREATED AS A 

542
00:15:28,994 --> 00:15:29,995
UNIQUE CONVERSATION ON THIS 

543
00:15:29,995 --> 00:15:34,633
TOPIC AND A REAL TIME POLITICAL 

544
00:15:34,633 --> 00:15:35,034
CONTEXT. 

545
00:15:35,034 --> 00:15:36,368
HE DESERVES YOU ARE LOOKING IN 

546
00:15:36,368 --> 00:15:37,936
THE HISTORY OF AMERICAN 

547
00:15:37,936 --> 00:15:39,271
POLITICS CREDIT FOR INNOVATION. 

548
00:15:39,271 --> 00:15:39,838
NOBODY HAD EVER DONE THAT 

549
00:15:39,838 --> 00:15:40,071
BEFORE. 

550
00:15:40,071 --> 00:15:43,042
I HAVE TALKED TO A LOT OF 

551
00:15:43,042 --> 00:15:44,142
REPUBLICANS WHO CAN'T IMAGINE A 

552
00:15:44,142 --> 00:15:46,845
SCENARIO AFTER DONALD TRUMP HAS 

553
00:15:46,845 --> 00:15:49,248
LEFT THE POLITICAL STAGE IN 

554
00:15:49,248 --> 00:15:50,049
AMERICA IN WHICH A REPUBLICAN 

555
00:15:50,049 --> 00:15:51,850
WILL NOT DO A SIMILAR THING, 

556
00:15:51,850 --> 00:15:53,252
HAVE A SUPREME COURT LIST AND 

557
00:15:53,252 --> 00:15:53,785
SAY I VETTED IT. 

558
00:15:53,785 --> 00:15:55,621
NOW YOU CAN VET THAT LIST. 

559
00:15:55,621 --> 00:15:57,422
AND IN THE PROCESS VET ME AS A 

560
00:15:57,422 --> 00:16:00,225
WAY OF DECIDING WHETHER OR NOT 

561
00:16:00,225 --> 00:16:01,392
I'M WORTHY OF YOUR SUPPORT. 

562
00:16:01,392 --> 00:16:02,461
IN THIS ONE RESPECT, ON THE 

563
00:16:02,461 --> 00:16:04,562
POLITICS OF THE LAW AND THE 

564
00:16:04,562 --> 00:16:05,998
POLITICS OF THE JUDICIARY, 

565
00:16:05,998 --> 00:16:08,100
DONALD TRUMP WAS INNOVATIVE AND 

566
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:08,700
IT WORKED FOR HIM. 

567
00:16:08,700 --> 00:16:11,036
>> THANK YOU SO MUCH, MAJOR 

568
00:16:11,036 --> 00:16:11,336
GARRETT. 

569
00:16:11,336 --> 00:16:12,972
WE JUST SHOWED THAT LIST OF 

570
00:16:12,972 --> 00:16:13,505
OTHER POTENTIAL NOMINEES. 

571
00:16:13,505 --> 00:16:15,140
AND WE ARE WAITING TO HEAR FROM 

572
00:16:15,140 --> 00:16:15,841
THE PRESIDENT WHO IS MAKING 

573
00:16:15,841 --> 00:16:17,276
REMARKS AT THE WHITE HOUSE 

574
00:16:17,276 --> 00:16:21,013
WHILE HE MEETS WITH THE 

575
00:16:21,013 --> 00:16:22,247
PRESIDENT OF PORTUGAL. 

576
00:16:22,247 --> 00:16:23,214
LET'S BRING BACK ILIA SHAPIRO. 

577
00:16:23,214 --> 00:16:26,785
HE IS A SENIOR FELLOW AT THE 

578
00:16:26,785 --> 00:16:27,152
KATO INSTITUTE. 

579
00:16:27,152 --> 00:16:28,854
>> HOW CRITICAL IS THIS TIMING, 

580
00:16:28,854 --> 00:16:30,722
ESPECIALLY AHEAD OF THE MID 

581
00:16:30,722 --> 00:16:31,256
TERMS. 

582
00:16:31,256 --> 00:16:32,657
>> WELL, YOU PUT YOUR FINGER ON 

583
00:16:32,657 --> 00:16:32,824
IT. 

584
00:16:32,824 --> 00:16:34,960
I DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH OF A 

585
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:36,795
CALCULATION THIS WAS FOR 

586
00:16:36,795 --> 00:16:39,431
KENNEDY BUT CERTAINLY GIVEN THE 

587
00:16:39,431 --> 00:16:42,368
CHANCE DEMOCRATS COULD TAKE THE 

588
00:16:42,368 --> 00:16:43,469
SENATE IN NOVEMBER, THIS ALLOWS 

589
00:16:43,469 --> 00:16:45,204
THE PRESIDENT TRUMP AND THE 

590
00:16:45,204 --> 00:16:46,872
REPUBLICAN MAJORITY IN THE 

591
00:16:46,872 --> 00:16:48,240
SENATE TO FILL THAT SEAT. 

592
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:50,442
AND SO THIS IS VERY DIFFERENT 

593
00:16:50,442 --> 00:16:52,511
THAN HAD HE WAITED ANOTHER 

594
00:16:52,511 --> 00:16:52,911
YEAR. 

595
00:16:52,911 --> 00:16:54,746
BECAUSE I THINK GIVEN THE 

596
00:16:54,746 --> 00:16:56,148
GORSUCH PRECEDENT, I DON'T 

597
00:16:56,148 --> 00:16:57,950
THINK WE WILL EVER SEE A 

598
00:16:57,950 --> 00:17:01,520
JUSTICE CONFIRMED TO A SEAT BY 

599
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:04,790
A SENATE OF THE OPPOSITE PARTY 

600
00:17:04,790 --> 00:17:05,423
TO THE WHITE HOUSE. 

601
00:17:05,423 --> 00:17:06,858
CERTAINLY NOT THE LAST YEAR 

602
00:17:06,858 --> 00:17:08,627
BEFORE ELECTION AND PROBABLY 

603
00:17:08,627 --> 00:17:09,560
EVEN LONGER THAN THAT. 

604
00:17:09,560 --> 00:17:11,262
SO THE TIMING IS AWES PISHES. 

605
00:17:11,262 --> 00:17:11,997
AND MITCH MCCONNELL ESPECIALLY 

606
00:17:11,997 --> 00:17:13,866
THE LAST WEEK OR TWO HAS BEEN 

607
00:17:13,866 --> 00:17:15,200
GIVING A LOT OF INTERVIEWS 

608
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:17,636
TALKING ABOUT HOW JUDGES IS THE 

609
00:17:17,636 --> 00:17:18,303
BIGGEST PART OF HIS LEGACY. 

610
00:17:18,303 --> 00:17:19,805
I THINK THAT IS ABSOLUTELY 

611
00:17:19,805 --> 00:17:20,973
RIGHT. 

612
00:17:20,973 --> 00:17:22,441
AND HERE HE GETS A CHANCE TO 

613
00:17:22,441 --> 00:17:22,941
GUILD THAT LILY. 

614
00:17:22,941 --> 00:17:25,611
AND PRESIDENT TRUMP COULD GO 

615
00:17:25,611 --> 00:17:27,112
DOWN AS VERY INFLUENTIAL, NOT 

616
00:17:27,112 --> 00:17:29,548
FOR ANYTHING THAT HE MAKES NEWS 

617
00:17:29,548 --> 00:17:31,850
FOR, TWEETS ABOUT BUT SIMPLY 

618
00:17:31,850 --> 00:17:33,819
FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO APPOINT 

619
00:17:33,819 --> 00:17:35,120
WELL NOW A SECOND JUSTICE AND A 

620
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:36,889
SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF THE LOWER 

621
00:17:36,889 --> 00:17:37,222
COURTS. 

622
00:17:37,222 --> 00:17:38,123
AND THAT IS FOR LIFE. 

623
00:17:38,123 --> 00:17:39,491
THAT IS REGARDLESS OF WHETHER 

624
00:17:39,491 --> 00:17:41,727
HE LOSES THE WHITE HOUSE NOW IN 

625
00:17:41,727 --> 00:17:43,729
TWO YEARS, SIX YEARS OR 

626
00:17:43,729 --> 00:17:44,096
ANYTHING ELSE. 

627
00:17:44,096 --> 00:17:45,030
>> WHEN WE WERE SPEAKING 

628
00:17:45,030 --> 00:17:46,265
EARLIER WE WERE TALKING ABOUT 

629
00:17:46,265 --> 00:17:48,700
THE LETTER THAT THE JUSTICE 

630
00:17:48,700 --> 00:17:50,969
GAVE TO THE PRESIDENT 

631
00:17:50,969 --> 00:17:51,670
ANNOUNCING HIS RETIREMENT. 

632
00:17:51,670 --> 00:17:52,638
THE DECISION IS EFFECTIVE JULY 

633
00:17:52,638 --> 00:17:53,171
31st THIS YEAR. 

634
00:17:53,171 --> 00:17:54,706
THERE IS NO CHANCE THAT HE WILL 

635
00:17:54,706 --> 00:17:57,776
WAIT UNTIL THERE IS A 

636
00:17:57,776 --> 00:17:58,477
REPLACEMENT IN PLACE. 

637
00:17:58,477 --> 00:18:01,313
HOW TYPICAL IS THIS FOR HIM NOT 

638
00:18:01,313 --> 00:18:03,815
TO EXTEND HIS RETIREMENT, 

639
00:18:03,815 --> 00:18:06,752
REALLY MAKE IT DEFINITIVE? 

640
00:18:06,752 --> 00:18:07,486
>> IT IS DEPENDENT. 

641
00:18:07,486 --> 00:18:10,956
DIFFERENT JUSTICES HAVE DONE IT 

642
00:18:10,956 --> 00:18:11,657
IN DIFFERENT WAYS. 

643
00:18:11,657 --> 00:18:13,225
JUSTICE O'CONNOR ANNOUNCED SHE 

644
00:18:13,225 --> 00:18:15,861
WOULD LEAVE WHEN HER SUCCESSOR 

645
00:18:15,861 --> 00:18:16,228
WAS CONFIRMED. 

646
00:18:16,228 --> 00:18:18,997
THAT ALLOWED A SEAMLESS 

647
00:18:18,997 --> 00:18:20,232
TRANSITION TO JUSTICE ELIDO IN 

648
00:18:20,232 --> 00:18:23,602
THE MIDDLE OF THAT PARTICULAR 

649
00:18:23,602 --> 00:18:23,869
TERM. 

650
00:18:23,869 --> 00:18:25,070
OTHER JUSTICES HAVE SAID 

651
00:18:25,070 --> 00:18:26,938
IMMEDIATELY I THINK WHEN 

652
00:18:26,938 --> 00:18:27,906
MARSHALL ANNOUNCED HIS 

653
00:18:27,906 --> 00:18:28,874
RETIREMENT, HE WAS ALLOWED TO 

654
00:18:28,874 --> 00:18:30,275
ANNOUNCE IT IN OPEN COURT THE 

655
00:18:30,275 --> 00:18:31,410
LAST DAY OF THE TERM, WHICH 

656
00:18:31,410 --> 00:18:32,945
WOULD HAVE BEEN THIS MORNING 

657
00:18:32,945 --> 00:18:34,446
WHEN THEY WERE ANNOUNCING THEIR 

658
00:18:34,446 --> 00:18:38,617
OPINION, ANNOUNCED THAT HE WAS 

659
00:18:38,617 --> 00:18:39,084
RETIRING IMMEDIATELY. 

660
00:18:39,084 --> 00:18:39,852
HERE SOMETHING IN BETWEEN THE 

661
00:18:39,852 --> 00:18:41,820
TWO OPTIONS SAYING I'LL GIVE IT 

662
00:18:41,820 --> 00:18:42,087
A MONTH. 

663
00:18:42,087 --> 00:18:43,322
BUT THAT REALLY GIVEN THAT IT 

664
00:18:43,322 --> 00:18:45,390
IS THE SUMMER, IT IS NO 

665
00:18:45,390 --> 00:18:48,360
DIFFERENT THAN IF HE WOULD HAVE 

666
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:49,962
ANNOUNCED HE WAS RETIRING 

667
00:18:49,962 --> 00:18:50,295
IMMEDIATELY. 

668
00:18:50,295 --> 00:18:52,664
THE DIFFERENT JUSTICES DO IT IN 

669
00:18:52,664 --> 00:18:53,031
DIFFERENT WAYS. 

670
00:18:53,031 --> 00:18:54,666
BUT THIS GIVES THE WHOLE SUMMER 

671
00:18:54,666 --> 00:18:56,902
AND THE COURT IS NOT DUE TO 

672
00:18:56,902 --> 00:18:57,970
PICK UP AGAIN UNTIL EARLY 

673
00:18:57,970 --> 00:18:58,237
OCTOBER. 

674
00:18:58,237 --> 00:19:00,205
GIVES ALL OF THAT TIME FOR -- 

675
00:19:00,205 --> 00:19:01,940
TO PICK A NOMINEE, TO HOLD 

676
00:19:01,940 --> 00:19:03,208
HEARINGS AND HAVE A 

677
00:19:03,208 --> 00:19:03,641
CONFIRMATION VOTE. 

678
00:19:03,641 --> 00:19:05,077
SO THERE IS TIME TO HAVE THE 

679
00:19:05,077 --> 00:19:06,945
NORMAL KIND OF PROCESS THAT WE 

680
00:19:06,945 --> 00:19:09,014
DID NOT OBVIOUSLY SEE AFTER 

681
00:19:09,014 --> 00:19:09,748
JUSTICE SCALIA'S DEATH. 

682
00:19:09,748 --> 00:19:10,949
>> IS THERE ANY CHANCE THAT 

683
00:19:10,949 --> 00:19:13,252
THIS SEAT WILL BE VACANT LIKE 

684
00:19:13,252 --> 00:19:14,953
IT WAS AFTER SCALIA DIED OR IS 

685
00:19:14,953 --> 00:19:24,196
THAT CHANCE GONE NOW THAT THE 

686
00:19:24,196 --> 00:19:25,097
FILIBUSTER MECHANISM HAS BEEN 

687
00:19:25,097 --> 00:19:25,397
DISMANDED. 

688
00:19:25,397 --> 00:19:29,468
>> IT DEPENDS ON PURE CHANCE 

689
00:19:29,468 --> 00:19:29,801
AND NUMBERS. 

690
00:19:29,801 --> 00:19:30,702
WHOEVER PRESIDENT TRUMP PICKS, 

691
00:19:30,702 --> 00:19:32,571
HE WILL FIRST RUN IT BY THE 

692
00:19:32,571 --> 00:19:37,909
MOST MODERATE MEMBERS OF THE 

693
00:19:37,909 --> 00:19:39,011
REPUBLICAN CAUCUS. 

694
00:19:39,011 --> 00:19:39,844
SUSAN COLLINS OF MAINE. 

695
00:19:39,844 --> 00:19:40,312
JOHN MCCAIN'S HEALTH. 

696
00:19:40,312 --> 00:19:42,980
WOULD HE BE ABLE TO MAKE IT 

697
00:19:42,980 --> 00:19:43,548
BACK. 

698
00:19:43,548 --> 00:19:45,950
OR WILL -- YOU KNOW, IT IS NOT 

699
00:19:45,950 --> 00:19:46,818
INCONCEIVABLE THAT MIKE PENCE 

700
00:19:46,818 --> 00:19:50,088
MAY HAVE TO BREAK A TIE VOTE. 

701
00:19:50,088 --> 00:19:51,990
ASSUMING THAT THOSE MORE 

702
00:19:51,990 --> 00:19:54,059
MODERATE SWING, IF YOU WILL, 

703
00:19:54,059 --> 00:19:56,762
REPUBLICAN SENATE VOTES ARE ON 

704
00:19:56,762 --> 00:19:58,463
BOARD, THEN GIVEN THE NO 

705
00:19:58,463 --> 00:20:00,332
FILIBUSTER, THIS IS -- SHOULD 

706
00:20:00,332 --> 00:20:00,799
BE SMOOTH SAILING. 

707
00:20:00,799 --> 00:20:04,102
AND HOW DO YOU THINK HIS 

708
00:20:04,102 --> 00:20:06,104
DEPARTURE WILL IMPACT CHIEF 

709
00:20:06,104 --> 00:20:07,139
JUSTICE JOHN ROBERTS. 

710
00:20:07,139 --> 00:20:08,407
>> WELL, ROBERTS WILL GAIN IN 

711
00:20:08,407 --> 00:20:08,874
POWER. 

712
00:20:08,874 --> 00:20:09,675
THE CHIEF JUSTICE IS OF COURSE 

713
00:20:09,675 --> 00:20:12,043
ONLY ONE OF THE NINE VOTES. 

714
00:20:12,043 --> 00:20:14,513
HE DOESN'T GET MORE VOTES THAN 

715
00:20:14,513 --> 00:20:14,713
THAT. 

716
00:20:14,713 --> 00:20:15,413
HE DOES HAVE AN ASSIGNMENT 

717
00:20:15,413 --> 00:20:17,449
POWER WHEN HE'S IN THE 

718
00:20:17,449 --> 00:20:17,716
MAJORITY. 

719
00:20:17,716 --> 00:20:19,918
HE CAN PICK WHO GETS TO WRITE 

720
00:20:19,918 --> 00:20:22,487
THE OPINIONS AND THERE ARE 

721
00:20:22,487 --> 00:20:22,987
ADMINISTRATIVE TASKS. 

722
00:20:22,987 --> 00:20:24,990
NOW HE WILL BECOME THE VERY 

723
00:20:24,990 --> 00:20:25,657
MIDDLE OF THE COURT. 

724
00:20:25,657 --> 00:20:28,093
MEANING FOUR JUSTICES WILL BE 

725
00:20:28,093 --> 00:20:28,727
TO HIS LEFT. 

726
00:20:28,727 --> 00:20:35,033
FOUR WILL BE TO HIS RIGHT. 

727
00:20:35,033 --> 00:20:37,002
IDEOLOGICALLY NOT JUST 

728
00:20:37,002 --> 00:20:37,736
LOGISTICALLY HOW THE COURT 

729
00:20:37,736 --> 00:20:38,103
SITS. 

730
00:20:38,103 --> 00:20:39,304
IF SOME PEOPLE HAD BEEN CALLING 

731
00:20:39,304 --> 00:20:41,073
THE COURT THE KENNEDY COURT 

732
00:20:41,073 --> 00:20:41,907
BECAUSE THE RETIRING JUSTICE 

733
00:20:41,907 --> 00:20:43,609
KENNEDY HAS BEEN THE SWING VOTE 

734
00:20:43,609 --> 00:20:45,544
ON SO MANY ISSUES, NOW THE 

735
00:20:45,544 --> 00:20:46,745
ROBERTS COURT NAMED AFTER THE 

736
00:20:46,745 --> 00:20:49,047
CHIEF JUSTICE WILL ALSO BE THE 

737
00:20:49,047 --> 00:20:52,084
ROBERTS COURT IN TERMS OF WHO 

738
00:20:52,084 --> 00:20:53,885
HAS THE POSITION OF POWER. 

739
00:20:53,885 --> 00:20:54,886
>> THANK YOU SO MUCH. 

740
00:20:54,886 --> 00:20:57,322
>>> JUST TO RECAP WHAT WE HAVE 

741
00:20:57,322 --> 00:20:59,791
BEEN LEARNING OF COURSE JUSTICE 

742
00:20:59,791 --> 00:21:01,492
ANTHONY KENNEDY HAS ANNOUNCED 

743
00:21:01,492 --> 00:21:01,960
HIS RETIREMENT. 

744
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:03,395
THIS IS THE LETTER THAT HE SENT 

745
00:21:03,395 --> 00:21:05,230
TO PRESIDENT TRUMP SAYING THAT 

746
00:21:05,230 --> 00:21:07,199
HIS -- BEFORE WE DO THAT, LET'S 

747
00:21:07,199 --> 00:21:08,799
LISTEN IN TO MITCH MCCONNELL 

748
00:21:08,799 --> 00:21:11,103
WHO IS MAKING REMARKS. 

749
00:21:11,269 --> 00:21:13,538
I SUGGEST THE ABSENCE OF A

750
00:21:13,538 --> 00:21:13,805
QUORUM.

751
00:21:13,805 --> 00:21:14,672
THE PRESIDING OFFICER: THE CLERK

752
00:21:14,672 --> 00:21:19,711
WILL CALL THE ROLL.

753
00:21:21,747 --> 00:21:22,147
>> MR. ALEXANDER. 

754
00:21:22,147 --> 00:21:24,282
>> THIS ALL HAPPENS THE DAY 

755
00:21:24,282 --> 00:21:28,053
THAT JUSTICE ANTONIN SCALIA -- 

756
00:21:28,053 --> 00:21:30,722
I'M SORRY, JUSTICE ANTHONY 

757
00:21:30,722 --> 00:21:31,923
KENNEDY ANNOUNCES HIS 

758
00:21:31,923 --> 00:21:32,391
RETIREMENT. 

759
00:21:32,391 --> 00:21:34,793
THIS IS A LETTER THAT HE GAVE 

760
00:21:34,793 --> 00:21:35,694
PRESIDENT TRUMP EFFECTIVE 

761
00:21:35,694 --> 00:21:36,728
IMMEDIATELY JULY 31st, HE IS 

762
00:21:36,728 --> 00:21:36,995
RETIRING. 

763
00:21:36,995 --> 00:21:39,698
THIS IS SOMETHING THAT HAD BEEN 

764
00:21:39,698 --> 00:21:39,965
RUMORED. 

765
00:21:39,965 --> 00:21:43,235
BUT THE TIMING IS VERY 

766
00:21:43,235 --> 00:21:43,568
INTERESTING. 

767
00:21:43,568 --> 00:21:44,670
LET'S BRING IN A CONTRIBUTING 

768
00:21:44,670 --> 00:21:48,573
EDITOR AT NEWS WEEK AND A 

769
00:21:48,573 --> 00:21:49,474
SENIOR EDITOR AT SLATE. 

770
00:21:49,474 --> 00:21:50,976
DALIA, HOW KEY WAS HIS VOTE? 

771
00:21:50,976 --> 00:21:51,943
HE WAS CONSIDERED THE JUSTICE 

772
00:21:51,943 --> 00:21:53,845
MOST LIKELY TO BE A SWING VOTE. 

773
00:21:55,647 --> 00:21:55,881
>> YES. 

774
00:21:55,881 --> 00:21:57,983
HE WAS WITHOUT DOUBT TO THE 

775
00:21:57,983 --> 00:22:00,485
EXTENT THAT ANYBODY SWUNG, IT 

776
00:22:00,485 --> 00:22:02,020
WAS HIM. 

777
00:22:02,020 --> 00:22:04,389
HE KIND OF INHERITED THAT 

778
00:22:04,389 --> 00:22:04,956
MANTLE FROM O'CONNOR. 

779
00:22:04,956 --> 00:22:06,792
HISTORICALLY SHE HAD BEEN THE 

780
00:22:06,792 --> 00:22:09,094
FIFTH DECIDING VOTE ONE WAY OR 

781
00:22:09,094 --> 00:22:10,061
THE OTHER. 

782
00:22:10,061 --> 00:22:11,163
WHEN SHE RETIRED, HE WAS 

783
00:22:11,163 --> 00:22:13,732
WITHOUT A DOUBT THE PERSON ON 

784
00:22:13,732 --> 00:22:15,767
THE COURT MOST LIKELY TO MAKE 

785
00:22:15,767 --> 00:22:18,670
UP THE 5-4 IN ONE DIRECTION OR 

786
00:22:18,670 --> 00:22:18,937
ANOTHER. 

787
00:22:18,937 --> 00:22:19,771
I THINK JAN CRAWFORD MADE THE 

788
00:22:19,771 --> 00:22:23,141
POINT AND I THINK IT IS RIGHT 

789
00:22:23,141 --> 00:22:25,143
THAT DIDN'T MAKE HIM A 

790
00:22:25,143 --> 00:22:25,944
CENTRALIST. 

791
00:22:25,944 --> 00:22:27,345
IT MADE HIM A CONSERVATIVE 

792
00:22:27,345 --> 00:22:28,980
JUSTICE WHO ON OCCASION, 

793
00:22:28,980 --> 00:22:32,084
PARTICULARLY ON AREAS THAT WERE 

794
00:22:32,084 --> 00:22:35,220
REALLY IMPORTANT TO HIM, GAY 

795
00:22:35,220 --> 00:22:35,820
RIGHTS, WOMEN'S REPRODUCTIVE 

796
00:22:35,820 --> 00:22:37,055
RIGHTS, AFFIRMATIVE ACTION, 

797
00:22:37,055 --> 00:22:38,323
WOULD SOMETIMES ALIGN HIMSELF 

798
00:22:38,323 --> 00:22:40,225
WITH THE FOUR JUSTICES ON THE 

799
00:22:40,225 --> 00:22:40,425
LEFT. 

800
00:22:40,425 --> 00:22:42,961
SO TO THE EXTENT THAT WE DON'T 

801
00:22:42,961 --> 00:22:43,895
HAVE THAT PERSON AFTER  JULY 

802
00:22:43,895 --> 00:22:46,731
31st, I THINK THAT IS ACCURATE. 

803
00:22:46,731 --> 00:22:48,533
IT IS A BIG, BIG SEAT TO FILL. 

804
00:22:48,533 --> 00:22:51,703
>> NOW, HE WAS NOMINATED BY A 

805
00:22:51,703 --> 00:22:52,203
CONSERVATIVE PRESIDENT. 

806
00:22:52,203 --> 00:22:55,206
IS THIS A BLOW TO DEMOCRATS? 

807
00:22:55,206 --> 00:22:58,009
>> WELL,I THINK IT IS A 

808
00:22:58,009 --> 00:22:59,745
TREMENDOUS BLOW TO DEMOCRATS, 

809
00:22:59,745 --> 00:23:02,314
BOTH INSOFAR AS HE WILL WITHOUT 

810
00:23:02,314 --> 00:23:05,517
A DOUBT BE REPLACED BY SOMEONE 

811
00:23:05,517 --> 00:23:07,853
FAR TO HIS RIGHT. 

812
00:23:07,853 --> 00:23:09,621
SOMEONE MUCH MORE LIKE NEIL 

813
00:23:09,621 --> 00:23:10,355
GORSUCH THAN LIKE JOHN ROBERTS. 

814
00:23:10,355 --> 00:23:12,757
SO I THINK IT IS A BLOW IN THAT 

815
00:23:12,757 --> 00:23:13,124
SENSE. 

816
00:23:13,124 --> 00:23:15,560
I THINK IT IS ALSO A BLOW IN 

817
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:19,030
THAT THERE'S A LEGACY HERE. 

818
00:23:19,030 --> 00:23:21,967
THERE'S AN ENORMOUS LEGACY IN 

819
00:23:21,967 --> 00:23:22,933
WHICH ANTHONY KENNEDY HELD THE 

820
00:23:22,933 --> 00:23:26,738
COURT IN CHECK. 

821
00:23:26,738 --> 00:23:29,407
IN TERMS OF OVERRULING ROE V. 

822
00:23:29,407 --> 00:23:29,975
WADE. 

823
00:23:29,975 --> 00:23:31,843
IN TERMS OF NOT ALLOWING 

824
00:23:31,843 --> 00:23:32,276
MARRIAGE EQUALITY. 

825
00:23:32,276 --> 00:23:35,113
THERE WAS AN AREA AFTER AREA 

826
00:23:35,113 --> 00:23:36,415
THAT HE WAS THE DECISIVE VOTE. 

827
00:23:36,415 --> 00:23:38,984
AND I DON'T THINK IT IS 

828
00:23:38,984 --> 00:23:40,218
OVERSTATEMENT TO SUGGEST THAT 

829
00:23:40,218 --> 00:23:42,888
ALL OF THOSE AREAS OF THE LAW 

830
00:23:42,888 --> 00:23:44,489
IN WHICH HE WAS THE DECISIVE 

831
00:23:44,489 --> 00:23:46,257
FIFTH VOTE ARE NOW GOING TO BE 

832
00:23:46,257 --> 00:23:46,791
UP FOR GRABS. 

833
00:23:46,791 --> 00:23:47,158
>> THANK YOU. 

834
00:23:47,158 --> 00:23:48,894
WE WANT IT TAKE YOU NOW TO THE 

835
00:23:48,894 --> 00:23:50,395
WHITE HOUSE WHERE MOMENTS AGO 

836
00:23:50,395 --> 00:23:52,998
THE PRESIDENT ADDRESSED THE 

837
00:23:52,998 --> 00:23:53,631
RETIREMENT OF JUSTICE KENNEDY. 

838
00:23:53,631 --> 00:23:54,132
LET'S LISTEN IN. 

839
00:23:54,132 --> 00:23:56,334
>> I HAVE RESPECTED FOR A LONG 

840
00:23:56,334 --> 00:23:56,635
TIME. 

841
00:23:56,635 --> 00:23:57,969
HE'S BEEN A GREAT JUSTICE OF 

842
00:23:57,969 --> 00:24:02,107
THE SUPREME COURT. 

843
00:24:02,107 --> 00:24:06,478
HE -- HE IS A MAN WHO IS 

844
00:24:06,478 --> 00:24:08,346
DISPLAYED GREAT VISION, 

845
00:24:08,346 --> 00:24:09,848
TREMENDOUS VISION AND 

846
00:24:09,848 --> 00:24:10,248
TREMENDOUS HEART. 

847
00:24:10,248 --> 00:24:12,383
AND HE WILL BE MISSED. 

848
00:24:12,383 --> 00:24:15,052
BUT HE WILL BE RETIRING. 

849
00:24:15,052 --> 00:24:17,556
AND WE WILL BEGIN OUR SEARCH 

850
00:24:17,556 --> 00:24:21,960
FOR A NEW JUSTICE OF THE UNITED 

851
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:25,063
STATES SUPREME COURT. 

852
00:24:25,063 --> 00:24:25,663
THAT WILL BEGIN IMMEDIATELY. 

853
00:24:25,663 --> 00:24:27,065
AND HOPEFULLY WE'RE GOING TO 

854
00:24:27,065 --> 00:24:30,135
PICK SOMEBODY WHO WILL BE AS 

855
00:24:30,135 --> 00:24:30,468
OUTSTANDING. 

856
00:24:30,468 --> 00:24:33,939
SO I JUST WANT TO THANK JUSTICE 

857
00:24:33,939 --> 00:24:38,276
KENNEDY FOR THE YEARS OF 

858
00:24:38,276 --> 00:24:38,709
TREMENDOUS SERVICE. 

859
00:24:38,709 --> 00:24:40,478
HE'S A VERY SPECTACULAR MAN. 

860
00:24:40,478 --> 00:24:42,347
HE REALLY IS A SPECTACULAR MAN. 

861
00:24:42,347 --> 00:24:44,783
AND I KNOW THAT HE WILL BE 

862
00:24:44,783 --> 00:24:46,785
AROUND HOPEFULLY FOR A LONG 

863
00:24:46,785 --> 00:24:48,086
TIME TO ADVISE AND I BELIEVE 

864
00:24:48,086 --> 00:24:50,555
HE'S GOING TO BE TEACHING AND 

865
00:24:50,555 --> 00:24:51,890
DOING OTHER THINGS. 

866
00:24:51,890 --> 00:24:52,390
SO THANK YOU SO JUSTICE 

867
00:24:52,390 --> 00:24:54,526
KENNEDY. 

868
00:24:54,526 --> 00:24:58,063
OKAY. 

869
00:24:58,063 --> 00:24:59,464
THANK YOU. 

870
00:24:59,464 --> 00:25:00,465
>> THANK YOU. 

871
00:25:00,465 --> 00:25:00,932
THANK YOU, EVERYONE. 

872
00:25:00,932 --> 00:25:02,233
>> WE HAVE OBVIOUSLY NUMEROUS 

873
00:25:02,233 --> 00:25:02,701
PEOPLE. 

874
00:25:02,701 --> 00:25:04,002
WE HAVE A LIST OF 25 PEOPLE 

875
00:25:04,002 --> 00:25:07,572
THAT I ACTUALLY HAD DURING MY 

876
00:25:07,572 --> 00:25:07,839
ELECTION. 

877
00:25:07,839 --> 00:25:11,710
I HAD 20 AND THEN I ADDED FIVE 

878
00:25:11,710 --> 00:25:12,310
A LITTLE WHILE AGO. 

879
00:25:12,310 --> 00:25:15,413
WE HAVE A VERY EXCELLENT LIST 

880
00:25:15,413 --> 00:25:19,017
OF GREAT TALENTED HIGHLY 

881
00:25:19,017 --> 00:25:20,552
EDUCATED, HIGHLY INTELLIGENT, 

882
00:25:20,552 --> 00:25:21,152
HOPEFULLY TREMENDOUS PEOPLE. 

883
00:25:21,152 --> 00:25:24,522
I THINK THE LIST IS VERY 

884
00:25:24,522 --> 00:25:24,855
OUTSTANDING. 

885
00:25:24,855 --> 00:25:26,858
WHEN I WAS RUNNING, I PUT DOWN 

886
00:25:26,858 --> 00:25:28,593
A LIST OF 20 PEOPLE. 

887
00:25:28,593 --> 00:25:30,562
BECAUSE NOT BEING A POLITICIAN, 

888
00:25:30,562 --> 00:25:32,063
I THINK PEOPLE WANTED TO HEAR 

889
00:25:32,063 --> 00:25:37,002
WHAT SOME OF MY CHOICES MAY BE. 

890
00:25:37,002 --> 00:25:37,902
AND IT WAS PRETTY EFFECTIVE. 

891
00:25:37,902 --> 00:25:39,404
AND I THINK YOU SEE THE KIND OF 

892
00:25:39,404 --> 00:25:40,939
QUALITY THAT WE'RE LOOKING AT 

893
00:25:40,939 --> 00:25:44,542
WHEN YOU LOOK AT THAT LIST. 

894
00:25:44,542 --> 00:25:47,012
BUT I DID ADD -- I ADDED FIVE 

895
00:25:47,012 --> 00:25:48,380
ADDITIONAL PEOPLE TO THE LIST. 

896
00:25:48,380 --> 00:25:51,583
SO IT WILL BE SOMEBODY FROM 

897
00:25:51,583 --> 00:25:51,883
THAT LIST. 

898
00:25:51,883 --> 00:25:53,818
SO WE HAVE NOW BOILED IT DOWN 

899
00:25:53,818 --> 00:26:00,325
TO ABOUT 25 PEOPLE. 

900
00:26:00,325 --> 00:26:00,558
>> NO. 

901
00:26:00,558 --> 00:26:02,093
I WILL TELL YOU WE FOUGHT VERY 

902
00:26:02,093 --> 00:26:03,561
HARD TO GET IT HERE. 

903
00:26:03,561 --> 00:26:05,163
I THINK THEY'RE DOING A 

904
00:26:05,163 --> 00:26:09,334
FANTASTIC JOB WITH THE WORLD 

905
00:26:09,334 --> 00:26:09,701
CUP RIGHT NOW. 

906
00:26:09,701 --> 00:26:11,269
IT IS IN RUSSIA. 

907
00:26:11,269 --> 00:26:14,172
AND I WILL TELL YOU THAT IT IS 

908
00:26:14,172 --> 00:26:14,439
EXCITING. 

909
00:26:14,439 --> 00:26:16,074
MY SON LOVES SOCCER AND HE 

910
00:26:16,074 --> 00:26:17,008
LOVES WATCHING THE WORLD CUP. 

911
00:26:17,008 --> 00:26:18,810
AND THEY HAVE REALLY DONE A 

912
00:26:18,810 --> 00:26:21,946
FANTASTIC JOB WITH THE WORLD 

913
00:26:21,946 --> 00:26:22,146
CUP. 

914
00:26:22,146 --> 00:26:23,281
IT IS EXCITING. 

915
00:26:23,281 --> 00:26:24,749
EVEN IF YOU'RE A NON-SOCCER 

916
00:26:24,749 --> 00:26:24,949
FAN. 

917
00:26:24,949 --> 00:26:26,518
I'M A SOCCER FAN A LITTLE BIT 

918
00:26:26,518 --> 00:26:27,786
BUT I DON'T HAVE MUCH TIME. 

919
00:26:27,786 --> 00:26:29,220
>> WHO ARE YOU ROOTING FOR. 

920
00:26:29,220 --> 00:26:31,056
>> I'M ROOTING FOR EVERYBODY TO 

921
00:26:31,056 --> 00:26:31,323
DO WELL. 

922
00:26:31,323 --> 00:26:34,993
BUT I THINK THE VENUE HAS BEEN 

923
00:26:34,993 --> 00:26:35,293
FANTASTIC. 

924
00:26:35,293 --> 00:26:35,793
THEY REALLY HAVE SHOWN 

925
00:26:35,793 --> 00:26:36,327
SOMETHING VERY SPECIAL. 

926
00:26:36,327 --> 00:26:37,796
I FOUGHT VERY HARD TO GET IT 

927
00:26:37,796 --> 00:26:40,198
FOR THE UNITED STATES, MEXICO 

928
00:26:40,198 --> 00:26:41,065
AND CANADA. 

929
00:26:41,065 --> 00:26:43,935
AS YOU PROBABLY HAVE HEARD. 

930
00:26:43,935 --> 00:26:45,570
AND WE WERE HONORED TO BE 

931
00:26:45,570 --> 00:26:45,870
CHOSEN. 

932
00:26:45,870 --> 00:26:48,340
AND THIS IS A GREAT GENTLEMAN 

933
00:26:48,340 --> 00:26:50,775
AND A GREAT SOCCER FAN TOO. 

934
00:26:50,775 --> 00:26:52,510
BUT WE -- WE WERE VERY HONOR TO 

935
00:26:52,510 --> 00:26:54,212
BE CHOSEN FOR THE WORLD CUP. 

936
00:26:54,212 --> 00:27:01,352
SO WE LOOK FORWARD TO THAT. 

937
00:27:01,352 --> 00:27:01,719
>> MOST LIKELY. 

938
00:27:01,719 --> 00:27:05,924
JOHN BOLTON IS OVER IN RUSSIA 

939
00:27:05,924 --> 00:27:06,424
RIGHT NOW. 

940
00:27:06,424 --> 00:27:08,526
I JUST SAW WATCHING MEDIA THAT 

941
00:27:08,526 --> 00:27:11,162
HE'S -- HE'S MET WITH PRESIDENT 

942
00:27:11,162 --> 00:27:11,395
PUTIN. 

943
00:27:11,395 --> 00:27:13,832
I HAVEN'T GOTTEN THE FULL 

944
00:27:13,832 --> 00:27:14,132
REPORT YET. 

945
00:27:14,132 --> 00:27:16,034
IT LOOKS LIKE WE WILL BE 

946
00:27:16,034 --> 00:27:18,503
MEETING SOME TIME IN THE NOT 

947
00:27:18,503 --> 00:27:18,970
TOO DISTANT FUTURE. 

948
00:27:18,970 --> 00:27:20,839
I SAID IT FROM DAY ONE, GETTING 

949
00:27:20,839 --> 00:27:21,939
ALONG WITH RUSSIA AND CHINA AND 

950
00:27:21,939 --> 00:27:23,174
EVERYBODY IS A VERY GOOD THING. 

951
00:27:23,174 --> 00:27:24,609
IT IS GOOD FOR THE WORLD, IT IS 

952
00:27:24,609 --> 00:27:26,277
GOOD FOR US, IT IS GOOD FOR 

953
00:27:26,277 --> 00:27:28,179
EVERYBODY. 

954
00:27:28,179 --> 00:27:29,948
SO WE WILL PROBABLY BE MEETING 

955
00:27:29,948 --> 00:27:33,284
SOMETIME AROUND MY TRIP TO 

956
00:27:33,284 --> 00:27:33,651
EUROPE. 

957
00:27:33,651 --> 00:27:33,918
>> WHERE. 

958
00:27:33,918 --> 00:27:35,220
>> IT HASN'T BEEN DETERMINED 

959
00:27:35,220 --> 00:27:35,420
YET. 

960
00:27:35,420 --> 00:27:38,323
PROBABLY I WILL KNOW WITHIN AN 

961
00:27:38,323 --> 00:27:38,690
HOUR. 

962
00:27:38,690 --> 00:27:39,924
>> AND WHAT ABOUT THE 

963
00:27:39,924 --> 00:27:41,459
INJUNCTION ON IMMIGRATION. 

964
00:27:41,459 --> 00:27:44,162
WILL YOU FIGHT THAT. 

965
00:27:44,162 --> 00:27:47,432
THE JUDGE SAYS FAMILIED SHOULD 

966
00:27:47,432 --> 00:27:47,765
BE REUNITED. 

967
00:27:47,765 --> 00:27:48,933
>> WE BELIEVE FAMILIES SHOULD 

968
00:27:48,933 --> 00:27:49,333
BE TOGETHER ALSO. 

969
00:27:49,333 --> 00:27:51,068
THERE'S NOT A LOT TO FIGHT. 

970
00:27:51,068 --> 00:27:54,005
WHAT WE REALLY DO IS WE BELIEVE 

971
00:27:54,005 --> 00:27:55,139
IN VERY STRONG BORDERS. 

972
00:27:55,139 --> 00:27:55,406
NO CRIME. 

973
00:27:55,406 --> 00:27:57,275
AND THE DEMOCRATS BELIEVE IN 

974
00:27:57,275 --> 00:27:57,875
OPEN BORDERS AND PLENTY OF 

975
00:27:57,875 --> 00:27:58,109
CRIME. 

976
00:27:58,109 --> 00:28:00,412
BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT YOU GET 

977
00:28:00,412 --> 00:28:01,346
WITH THE OPEN BORDERS. 

978
00:28:01,346 --> 00:28:02,914
I WOULD LIKE TO INTRODUCE 

979
00:28:02,914 --> 00:28:05,282
HOWEVER THE PRESIDENT OF 

980
00:28:05,282 --> 00:28:05,549
PORTUGAL. 

981
00:28:05,549 --> 00:28:07,719
AND I'M SORRY TO BOTHER YOU, 

982
00:28:07,719 --> 00:28:09,921
BUT IN OUR COUNTRY, THE 

983
00:28:09,921 --> 00:28:10,789
SELECTION OF A JUSTICE OF THE 

984
00:28:10,789 --> 00:28:12,857
UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT IS 

985
00:28:12,857 --> 00:28:14,325
CONSIDERED I THINK WE CAN ALL 

986
00:28:14,325 --> 00:28:16,861
SAY ONE OF THE -- ONE OF THE 

987
00:28:16,861 --> 00:28:18,530
MOST IMPORTANT EVENTS, ONE OF 

988
00:28:18,530 --> 00:28:20,131
THE MOST IMPORTANT THINGS FOR 

989
00:28:20,131 --> 00:28:20,464
OUR COUNTRY. 

990
00:28:20,464 --> 00:28:21,966
I MEAN YOU SEE THE DECISION 

991
00:28:21,966 --> 00:28:24,135
THAT'S JUST CAME DOWN, HOW BIG 

992
00:28:24,135 --> 00:28:25,870
THEY ARE, HOW VITAL THEY ARE. 

993
00:28:25,870 --> 00:28:28,273
AND THEY CAN SWING DIFFERENT 

994
00:28:28,273 --> 00:28:29,974
WAYS DEPENDING ON WHO IT -- WHO 

995
00:28:29,974 --> 00:28:31,509
THEY MIGHT BE IN THE COURTS. 

996
00:28:31,509 --> 00:28:34,245
SO IT HAS ALWAYS BEEN 

997
00:28:34,245 --> 00:28:37,048
CONSIDERED A TREMENDOUS -- A 

998
00:28:37,048 --> 00:28:37,681
TREMENDOUSLY IMPORTANT THINGS. 

999
00:28:37,681 --> 00:28:38,382
SOME PEOPLE THINK OUTSIDE OF 

1000
00:28:38,382 --> 00:28:40,218
WAR AND PEACE OBVIOUSLY IT IS 

1001
00:28:40,218 --> 00:28:43,288
THE MOST IMPORTANT THING THAT 

1002
00:28:43,288 --> 00:28:44,389
YOU CAN HAVE. 

1003
00:28:44,389 --> 00:28:46,424
BUT ANOTHER VERY IMPORTANT 

1004
00:28:46,424 --> 00:28:48,126
THING IS INTRODUCING THE 

1005
00:28:48,126 --> 00:28:48,993
PRESIDENT, THE HIGHLY 

1006
00:28:48,993 --> 00:28:50,995
RESPECTED, I MUST SAY, 

1007
00:28:50,995 --> 00:28:52,430
PRESIDENT OF PORTUGAL. 

1008
00:28:52,430 --> 00:28:56,000
THANK YOU. 

1009
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:59,370
>> THANK YOU, PRESIDENT. 

1010
00:28:59,370 --> 00:29:00,038
AS A CONSTITUTIONAL LAW 

1011
00:29:00,038 --> 00:29:01,706
PROFESSOR, I KNOW HOW IMPORTANT 

1012
00:29:01,706 --> 00:29:03,707
IT IS WHEN A JUSTICE IN YOUR 

1013
00:29:03,707 --> 00:29:07,445
SUPREME COURT RETIRES. 

1014
00:29:07,445 --> 00:29:09,547
BECAUSE IT IS A KEY 

1015
00:29:09,547 --> 00:29:09,880
INSTITUTION. 

1016
00:29:09,880 --> 00:29:11,882
SO I JUST HEARD THE NEWS. 

1017
00:29:11,882 --> 00:29:14,319
AND I IMAGINE HOW IMPORTANT IT 

1018
00:29:14,319 --> 00:29:18,623
IS FOR YOU AND FOR ANY IN THE 

1019
00:29:18,623 --> 00:29:18,990
UNITED STATES. 

1020
00:29:18,990 --> 00:29:20,258
ANYWAY, I WOULD LIKE TO TELL 

1021
00:29:20,258 --> 00:29:22,327
YOU THAT WE HAVE A VERY LONG 

1022
00:29:22,327 --> 00:29:27,665
LASTING FRIENDSHIP AND 

1023
00:29:27,665 --> 00:29:28,199
PARTNERSHIP. 

1024
00:29:28,199 --> 00:29:28,432
>> YES. 

1025
00:29:28,432 --> 00:29:30,068
>> THAT STARTED. 

1026
00:29:30,068 --> 00:29:30,902
WE R■ECOGNIZED YOU. 

1027
00:29:30,902 --> 00:29:31,669
WE WERE THE FIRST NEUTRAL 

1028
00:29:31,669 --> 00:29:42,814
COMPANY TO RECOGNIZE THE UNITED 

1029
00:29:42,814 --> 00:29:43,247

1030
00:29:43,247 --> 00:29:43,848
OUR OLDEST ALLY ENGLAND. 

1031
00:29:43,848 --> 00:29:49,020
I DON'T KNOW IF YOU KNOW IT, 

1032
00:29:49,020 --> 00:29:51,956
BUT YOUR FOUNDING FATHERS 

1033
00:29:51,956 --> 00:29:53,691

OUR WINE, WITH MADERA WINE. 

1035
00:29:57,929 --> 00:29:58,796
>> GOOD TASTE. 

1036
00:29:58,796 --> 00:30:02,033
>> LONG, LONG STARTED OUR 

1037
00:30:02,033 --> 00:30:04,402
FRIENDSHIP, PARTNERSHIPPED 

1038
00:30:04,402 --> 00:30:09,374
BASED ON COMMON VAL -- 

1039
00:30:09,374 --> 00:30:12,644
PARTNERSHIP, BASED ON COMMON 

1040
00:30:12,644 --> 00:30:13,344
DEMOCRACY AND HUMAN RIGHTS. 

1041
00:30:13,344 --> 00:30:17,949
FELLOW CITIZENS THAT ARE BOTH 

1042
00:30:17,949 --> 00:30:22,453
AMERICAN AND PORTUGUESE. 

1043
00:30:22,453 --> 00:30:23,955
THEY LOVE PORTUGAL. 

1044
00:30:23,955 --> 00:30:26,124
THERE ARE AROUND 1,500,000 

1045
00:30:26,124 --> 00:30:26,758
PORTUGUESE AMERICANS LIVING 

1046
00:30:26,758 --> 00:30:27,224
HERE. 

1047
00:30:27,224 --> 00:30:29,126
IT IS NOT JUST A POLITICAL AND 

1048
00:30:29,126 --> 00:30:29,960
ECONOMIC ALLIANCE. 

1049
00:30:29,960 --> 00:30:31,796
IT IS MORE THAN THAT. 

1050
00:30:31,796 --> 00:30:33,764
IT IS SOMETHING VERY HUMAN. 

1051
00:30:33,764 --> 00:30:34,064
>> RIGHT. 

1052
00:30:34,064 --> 00:30:40,171
>> BECAUSE THEY'RE SPEAKING OF 

1053
00:30:40,171 --> 00:30:42,807
ONE MILLION AND 400,000 PEOPLE 

1054
00:30:42,807 --> 00:30:45,943
THAT HAVE LOVE FOR TWO 

1055
00:30:45,943 --> 00:30:47,478
COUNTRIES AT THE SAME TIME. 

1056
00:30:47,478 --> 00:30:49,814
AS YOU SPOKE OF SOCCER, LET ME 

1057
00:30:49,814 --> 00:30:51,549
ASK YOU, MAKE A SUGGESTION. 

1058
00:30:51,549 --> 00:30:51,816
>> OKAY. 

1059
00:30:51,816 --> 00:30:53,584
>> IF YOU'RE GOING TO MEET MR. 

1060
00:30:53,584 --> 00:30:53,985
PUTIN. 

1061
00:30:53,985 --> 00:30:55,720
I WAS WITH HIM LAST WEEK. 

1062
00:30:55,720 --> 00:30:55,987
>> GOOD. 

1063
00:30:55,987 --> 00:30:57,956
>> HE ASKED ME TO GREET YOU. 

1064
00:30:57,956 --> 00:31:01,592
OF COURSE HE WAS EXPECTING YOUR 

1065
00:31:01,592 --> 00:31:02,060
VISIT. 

1066
00:31:02,060 --> 00:31:06,931
BUT ANYWAY, DON'T FORGET THAT 

1067
00:31:06,931 --> 00:31:09,334
PORTUGAL HAS THE BEST IN THE 

1068
00:31:09,334 --> 00:31:09,600
WORLD. 

1069
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:11,502
I'M SURE THAT YOUR SON KNOWS 

1070
00:31:11,502 --> 00:31:12,069
IT. 

1071
00:31:12,069 --> 00:31:12,536
>> HE KNOWS IT WELL. 

1072
00:31:12,536 --> 00:31:15,740
>> DON'T FORGET IF YOU EVER GO 

1073
00:31:15,740 --> 00:31:19,978
TO RUSSIA DURING THE 

1074
00:31:19,978 --> 00:31:20,678
CHAMPIONSHIP, DON'T FORGET 

1075
00:31:20,678 --> 00:31:23,681
PORTUGUESE WANTS TO WIN. 

1076
00:31:23,681 --> 00:31:25,850
>> YOU'RE DOING VERY WELL. 

1077
00:31:25,850 --> 00:31:28,586
>> HE IS DOING VERY, VERY, VERY 

1078
00:31:28,586 --> 00:31:28,786
WELL. 

1079
00:31:28,786 --> 00:31:31,055
>> HOW GOOD A PLAYER IS HE? 

1080
00:31:31,055 --> 00:31:31,656
>> I'M VERY IMPRESSED. 

1081
00:31:31,656 --> 00:31:34,158
HE IS THE BEST PLAYER OF THE 

1082
00:31:34,158 --> 00:31:34,391
WORLD. 

1083
00:31:34,391 --> 00:31:37,795
IN A SENSE, WELL, I THINK HE 

1084
00:31:37,795 --> 00:31:40,965
HAS BEEN A SUCCESS. 

1085
00:31:40,965 --> 00:31:41,232
>> YEAH. 

1086
00:31:41,232 --> 00:31:42,800
I THINK -- 

1087
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:45,069
>> NO DOUBT ABOUT IT FOR THE 

1088
00:31:45,069 --> 00:31:45,770
WORLD. 

1089
00:31:45,770 --> 00:31:51,075
>> WILL CHRISTIAN EVER RUN FOR 

1090
00:31:51,075 --> 00:31:53,344
PRESIDENT AGAINST YOU? 

1091
00:31:53,344 --> 00:31:55,613
HE WOULDN'T WIN. 

1092
00:31:55,613 --> 00:31:57,948
>> I MUST TELL YOU -- IT IS A 

1093
00:31:57,948 --> 00:31:58,382
LITTLE DIFFERENT. 

1094
00:31:58,382 --> 00:32:01,019
>> WHEN DID YOU LEARN THAT 

1095
00:32:01,019 --> 00:32:01,953
JUSTICE KENNEDY WAS RETIRING. 

1096
00:32:01,953 --> 00:32:03,087
>> ABOUT HALF AN HOUR AGO. 

1097
00:32:03,087 --> 00:32:03,721
>> WERE YOU SURPRISED. 

1098
00:32:03,721 --> 00:32:05,523
>> HE CAME TO THE WHITE HOUSE. 

1099
00:32:05,523 --> 00:32:07,124
WE HAD A WONDERFUL DISCUSSION 

1100
00:32:07,124 --> 00:32:09,260
JUST PRIOR TO MEETING THE 

1101
00:32:09,260 --> 00:32:09,560
PRESIDENT. 

1102
00:32:09,560 --> 00:32:10,194
AND REALLY HAD A VERY DEEP 

1103
00:32:10,194 --> 00:32:13,364
DISCUSSION. 

1104
00:32:13,364 --> 00:32:15,600
I GOT HIS IDEAS ON THINGS, 

1105
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:16,935
INCLUDING I ASKED HIM IF HE HAD 

1106
00:32:16,935 --> 00:32:20,738
CERTAIN PEOPLE THAT HE HAD 

1107
00:32:20,738 --> 00:32:21,706
GREAT RESPECT FOR THAT 

1108
00:32:21,706 --> 00:32:22,840
POTENTIALLY COULD TAKE HIS 

1109
00:32:22,840 --> 00:32:25,276
SEAT, WHICH IS A VERY HARD SEAT 

1110
00:32:25,276 --> 00:32:25,677
TO FILL. 

1111
00:32:25,677 --> 00:32:27,445
SO WE TALKED ABOUT DIFFERENT 

1112
00:32:27,445 --> 00:32:27,678
THINGS. 

1113
00:32:27,678 --> 00:32:30,648
AND HE WAS HERE FOR ABOUT HALF 

1114
00:32:30,648 --> 00:32:30,914
AN HOUR. 

1115
00:32:30,914 --> 00:32:32,717
I DON'T THINK YOU FOLKS SAW HIM 

1116
00:32:32,717 --> 00:32:34,652
COME IN AND OUT, DID YOU? 

1117
00:32:34,652 --> 00:32:35,019
I'M SHOCKED. 

1118
00:32:35,019 --> 00:32:36,754
BOY, THEY HAVE DONE A GREAT 

1119
00:32:36,754 --> 00:32:36,954
JOB. 

1120
00:32:36,954 --> 00:32:38,789
THAT IS A SHOCKER. 

1121
00:32:38,789 --> 00:32:39,723
THAT'S A SHOCKER. 

1122
00:32:39,723 --> 00:32:41,526
BUT YEAH WE HAD A -- HE JUST 

1123
00:32:41,526 --> 00:32:43,094
LEFT A LITTLE WHILE AGO, JUST 

1124
00:32:43,094 --> 00:32:44,462
PRIOR TO MEETING THE PRESIDENT. 

1125
00:32:44,462 --> 00:32:48,800
>> WOULD YOU TELL US WHO HE 

1126
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:49,133
RECOMMENDED. 

1127
00:32:49,133 --> 00:32:49,367
>> NO. 

1128
00:32:49,367 --> 00:32:49,933
I WON'T DO THAT. 

1129
00:32:49,933 --> 00:32:51,636
BUT HE HAS -- YOU KNOW, THERE 

1130
00:32:51,636 --> 00:32:53,504
ARE CERTAIN NAMES THAT ARE JUST 

1131
00:32:53,504 --> 00:32:53,837
OUTSTANDING. 

1132
00:32:53,837 --> 00:32:56,474
NAMES THAT YOU ALREADY KNOW, TO 

1133
00:32:56,474 --> 00:32:57,942
BE HONEST WITH YOU. 

1134
00:32:57,942 --> 00:33:01,179
THEY ARE NAMES THAT YOU KNOW, 

1135
00:33:01,179 --> 00:33:02,413
OUTSTANDING, HIGHLY RESPECTED. 

1136
00:33:02,413 --> 00:33:04,282
NAMES YOU THAT WOULD KNOW, 

1137
00:33:04,282 --> 00:33:04,582
PRESIDENT. 

1138
00:33:04,582 --> 00:33:05,550
WE WILL BE LOOKING ATHE THEM 

1139
00:33:05,550 --> 00:33:06,517
AND OTHERS BUT THEY WILL COME 

1140
00:33:06,517 --> 00:33:08,886
FROM THE LIST OF 25 PEOPLE. 

1141
00:33:08,886 --> 00:33:09,187
OKAY. 

1142
00:33:09,187 --> 00:33:11,522
>> MR. PRESIDENT, IT IS AN 

1143
00:33:11,522 --> 00:33:11,889
ELECTION YEAR. 

1144
00:33:11,889 --> 00:33:13,057
WOULD YOU CONSIDER HOLDING THAT 

1145
00:33:13,057 --> 00:33:14,926
SPOT OPEN UNTIL THE MAKEUP OF 

1146
00:33:14,926 --> 00:33:15,927
CONGRESS IS DETERMINED COME 

1147
00:33:15,927 --> 00:33:16,194
NOVEMBER. 

1148
00:33:16,194 --> 00:33:17,195
>> I HAVEN'T REALLY THOUGHT 

1149
00:33:17,195 --> 00:33:17,495
ABOUT THAT. 

1150
00:33:17,495 --> 00:33:19,864
I THINK YOU NEED TO GO AS 

1151
00:33:19,864 --> 00:33:20,530
QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE. 

1152
00:33:20,530 --> 00:33:21,064
IT IS A PROCESS. 

1153
00:33:21,064 --> 00:33:22,200
I HAVEN'T THOUGHT ABOUT THAT. 

1154
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:24,101
WE HAD A BIG DAY YESTERDAY. 

1155
00:33:24,101 --> 00:33:26,871
VERY BIG. 

1156
00:33:26,871 --> 00:33:27,939
WE HAD A GREAT DECISION TODAY 

1157
00:33:27,939 --> 00:33:29,607
IN TERMS OF WHAT WAS JUST 

1158
00:33:29,607 --> 00:33:31,776
RELEASED BY THE SUPREME COURT 

1159
00:33:31,776 --> 00:33:32,076
YESTERDAY. 

1160
00:33:32,076 --> 00:33:33,544
OBVIOUSLY WITH THE TRAVEL BAN 

1161
00:33:33,544 --> 00:33:35,012
IT WAS EXTREMELY BIG. 

1162
00:33:35,012 --> 00:33:37,115
AND WE HAD SOME TREMENDOUS 

1163
00:33:37,115 --> 00:33:37,748
ELECTION. 

1164
00:33:37,748 --> 00:33:40,084
SOUTH CAROLINA FROM MY OWN 

1165
00:33:40,084 --> 00:33:41,285
STANDPOINT, SOUTH CAROLINA, THE 

1166
00:33:41,285 --> 00:33:42,653
GOVERNOR, McMASTER WAS A BIG 

1167
00:33:42,653 --> 00:33:42,853
WIN. 

1168
00:33:42,853 --> 00:33:43,788
AS YOU KNOW, I WAS VERY MUCH 

1169
00:33:43,788 --> 00:33:47,625
INVOLVED IN NEW YORK WITH THE 

1170
00:33:47,625 --> 00:33:48,092
CONGRESSMAN, DONOVAN. 

1171
00:33:48,092 --> 00:33:48,692
SO WE'RE VERY HAPPY. 

1172
00:33:48,692 --> 00:33:50,461
WE'RE -- THIS WAS A GOOD FEW 

1173
00:33:50,461 --> 00:33:50,661
DAYS. 

1174
00:33:50,661 --> 00:33:53,331
NOW I GET TO TAP IT OFF WITH 

1175
00:33:53,331 --> 00:33:55,032
MEETING WITH THE PRESIDENT OF 

1176
00:33:55,032 --> 00:33:55,299
PORTUGAL. 

1177
00:33:55,299 --> 00:33:55,966
AND PORTUGAL HAS BEEN ACTUALLY 

1178
00:33:55,966 --> 00:33:58,068
VERY IMPORTANT TO OUR NATION. 

1179
00:33:58,068 --> 00:33:58,970
AND YOU'RE RIGHT, WE HAVE ABOUT 

1180
00:33:58,970 --> 00:34:01,539
A MILLION AND A HALF PEOPLE 

1181
00:34:01,539 --> 00:34:01,972
FROM PORTUGAL HERE. 

1182
00:34:01,972 --> 00:34:03,474
THAT IS VERY IMPORTANT. 

1183
00:34:04,775 --> 00:34:05,009
>> NO. 

1184
00:34:05,009 --> 00:34:06,711
I WANT THEM TO DO WHAT THEY 

1185
00:34:06,711 --> 00:34:07,178
WANT. 

1186
00:34:07,178 --> 00:34:08,012
YOU KNOW, THE PROBLEM WE HAVE 

1187
00:34:08,012 --> 00:34:11,748
-- AND I TOLD THEM THIS 

1188
00:34:11,748 --> 00:34:13,784
MORNING, I SAID, PASS IT IF YOU 

1189
00:34:13,784 --> 00:34:13,984
CAN. 

1190
00:34:13,984 --> 00:34:16,353
I ALSO WANT HEM TO DO WHAT THEY 

1191
00:34:16,353 --> 00:34:16,621
WANT. 

1192
00:34:16,621 --> 00:34:18,322
WE HAVE A BIG IMMIGRATION BILL, 

1193
00:34:18,322 --> 00:34:19,090
LIKE YOU DO. 

1194
00:34:19,090 --> 00:34:20,056
AND EVERYBODY TALKS ABOUT 

1195
00:34:20,056 --> 00:34:20,424
IMMIGRATION. 

1196
00:34:20,424 --> 00:34:22,092
NOW I THINK MORE THAN EVER 

1197
00:34:22,092 --> 00:34:23,393
BEFORE. 

1198
00:34:23,393 --> 00:34:25,730
I TOLD THEM A FEW HOURS AGO, I 

1199
00:34:25,730 --> 00:34:28,199
SAID, LOOK, PASS SOMETHING OR 

1200
00:34:28,199 --> 00:34:30,768
COME BACK WITH SOMETHING THAT 

1201
00:34:30,768 --> 00:34:32,937
WOULD -- BUT GET SOMETHING YOU 

1202
00:34:32,937 --> 00:34:33,137
WANT. 

1203
00:34:33,137 --> 00:34:35,473
WE NEED DEMOCRAT VOTES IN THE 

1204
00:34:35,473 --> 00:34:36,040
SENATE. 

1205
00:34:36,040 --> 00:34:37,341
THAT'S WHY I DON'T GET OVERLY 

1206
00:34:37,341 --> 00:34:38,074
EXCITED WITH THE HOUSE BILL 

1207
00:34:38,074 --> 00:34:39,911
RIGHT NOW BECAUSE IT WON'T PASS 

1208
00:34:39,911 --> 00:34:40,911
IN THE SENATE. 

1209
00:34:40,911 --> 00:34:42,647
YOU'RE NOT GOING TO GET THE 

1210
00:34:42,647 --> 00:34:43,648
DEMOCRATS TO VOTE ANYTHING. 

1211
00:34:43,648 --> 00:34:45,516
IF WE GAVE THEM 100% OF WHAT 

1212
00:34:45,516 --> 00:34:46,617
THEY WANTED AND THEN DOUBLED 

1213
00:34:46,617 --> 00:34:47,851
IT, THEY STILL WOULDN'T PASS IT 

1214
00:34:47,851 --> 00:34:49,387
BECAUSE THEY THINK IT IS A GOOD 

1215
00:34:49,387 --> 00:34:49,786
ELECTION POINT. 

1216
00:34:49,786 --> 00:34:53,857
I THINK IT IS GOOD FOR US. 

1217
00:34:53,857 --> 00:34:54,524
BECAUSE I THINK STRONG BORDERS 

1218
00:34:54,524 --> 00:34:57,528
-- I DON'T EVEN KNOW HOW YOU 

1219
00:34:57,528 --> 00:34:58,229
FEEL ABOT THAT. 

1220
00:34:58,229 --> 00:34:59,564
BUT I THINK STRONG BORDERS AND 

1221
00:34:59,564 --> 00:35:01,064
NO CRIME, THAT IS US. 

1222
00:35:01,064 --> 00:35:03,401
THAT WILL BE A GREAT ELECTION 

1223
00:35:03,401 --> 00:35:03,901
POINT FOR US. 

1224
00:35:03,901 --> 00:35:05,937
SO I TOLD THEM TWO HOURS AGO, I 

1225
00:35:05,937 --> 00:35:08,306
SAID, YOU KNOW, DO WHAT YOU 

1226
00:35:08,306 --> 00:35:08,506
WANT. 

1227
00:35:08,506 --> 00:35:10,408
AND ULTIMATELY WE WILL COME TO 

1228
00:35:10,408 --> 00:35:10,708
SOMETHING. 

1229
00:35:10,708 --> 00:35:12,009
AND PERHAPS IT WILL BE AFTER 

1230
00:35:12,009 --> 00:35:12,443
THE ELECTION. 

1231
00:35:12,443 --> 00:35:14,144
MAYBE IT WILL BE BEFORE. 

1232
00:35:14,144 --> 00:35:15,313
AS OF THIS MOMENT, DEMOCRATS 

1233
00:35:15,313 --> 00:35:17,714
ARE NOT GOING TO VOTE FOR 

1234
00:35:17,714 --> 00:35:18,049
ANYTHING. 

1235
00:35:18,049 --> 00:35:19,683
THEY REALLY ARE RESISTING OR 

1236
00:35:19,683 --> 00:35:21,919
OBSTRUCTING. 

1237
00:35:21,919 --> 00:35:22,119
OKAY. 

1238
00:35:22,119 --> 00:35:22,486
THANK YOU VERY MUCH. 

1239
00:35:26,023 --> 00:35:27,791
>> DO YOU EXPECT AN OUTCOME. 

1240
00:35:27,791 --> 00:35:30,328
>> I THINK WE WILL BE TALKING 

1241
00:35:30,328 --> 00:35:30,995
ABOUT SYRIA AND UKRAINE. 

1242
00:35:30,995 --> 00:35:32,530
I THINK WE WILL BE TALKING 

1243
00:35:32,530 --> 00:35:34,231
ABOUT MANY OTHER SUBJECTS. 

1244
00:35:34,231 --> 00:35:37,334
AND WE WILL SEE WHAT HAPPENS. 

1245
00:35:37,334 --> 00:35:40,037
YOU NEVER KNOW ABOUT MEETINGS 

1246
00:35:40,037 --> 00:35:40,504
WHAT HAPPENS. 

1247
00:35:40,504 --> 00:35:42,840
I THINK GOOD THINGS CAN COME 

1248
00:35:42,840 --> 00:35:43,407
WITH MEETING WITH PEOPLE. 

1249
00:35:43,407 --> 00:35:45,042
WE HAD A GREAT MEETING WITH THE 

1250
00:35:45,042 --> 00:35:46,310
PRESIDENT OF CHINA A EVERY 

1251
00:35:46,310 --> 00:35:48,679
PLACE THAT I HAVE BEEN WE HAVE 

1252
00:35:48,679 --> 00:35:49,179
HAD GREAT MEETINGS. 

1253
00:35:49,179 --> 00:35:51,582
MAYBE SOMETHING POSITIVE WILL 

1254
00:35:51,582 --> 00:35:53,885
COME OUT OF IT. 

1255
00:36:23,914 --> 00:36:25,949
>> MEAN YOU GET COMPLACENT AND 

1256
00:36:25,949 --> 00:36:26,384
HE LOST. 

1257
00:36:26,384 --> 00:36:27,952
THAT'S A BIG LOSS. 

1258
00:36:27,952 --> 00:36:29,353
THAT WAS A SHOCKING LOSS. 

1259
00:36:29,353 --> 00:36:30,321
BUT IT IS WHAT IT IS. 

1260
00:36:30,321 --> 00:36:33,891
THANK YOU ALL VERY MUCH. 

1261
00:36:33,891 --> 00:36:34,191
THANK YOU. 

1262
00:36:34,191 --> 00:36:39,096
THANK YOU. 

1263
00:36:39,096 --> 00:36:39,930
>> THEY'RE DOING GREAT. 

1264
00:36:39,930 --> 00:36:41,766
BY THE WAY, THE STEEL INDUSTRY 

1265
00:36:41,766 --> 00:36:42,833
IS ABSOLUTELY DOING GREAT. 

1266
00:36:42,833 --> 00:36:43,901
THE TARIFFS HAVE BEEN 

1267
00:36:43,901 --> 00:36:44,201
INCREDIBLE. 

1268
00:36:44,201 --> 00:36:45,769
AND THE STEEL INDUSTRY IS DOING 

1269
00:36:45,769 --> 00:36:46,003
GREAT. 

1270
00:36:46,003 --> 00:36:48,339
AND OUR COUNTRY IS DOING GREAT. 

1271
00:36:48,339 --> 00:36:48,906
YOU'RE SEEING THE RESULTS. 

1272
00:36:48,906 --> 00:36:50,541
THE NUMBERS COMING OUT FROM THE 

1273
00:36:50,541 --> 00:36:52,076
COMPANIES ARE FAR BEYOND WHAT 

1274
00:36:52,076 --> 00:36:53,143
ANYBODY EVER THOUGHT POSSIBLE. 

1275
00:36:53,143 --> 00:36:54,312
WE'RE DOING REALLY GOOD. 

1276
00:36:54,312 --> 00:36:56,347
BUT WE HAVE TO HAVE FAIR TRADE 

1277
00:36:56,347 --> 00:36:58,582
DEALS AND WE'RE WORKING ON 

1278
00:36:58,582 --> 00:36:59,783
REALLY FAIR TRADE DEALS. 

1279
00:36:59,783 --> 00:37:02,253
WE'RE WORKING WITH YOUR 

1280
00:37:02,253 --> 00:37:04,388
REPRESENTATIVES ON FAIR TRADE 

1281
00:37:04,388 --> 00:37:04,521
DEALS. 

1282
00:37:06,490 --> 00:37:06,723
>> YES. 

1283
00:37:06,723 --> 00:37:09,560
YES. 

1284
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:10,027
>> THAT IS GOOD NEWS. 

1285
00:37:10,027 --> 00:37:10,828
>> THANK YOU EVERYBODY. 

1286
00:37:10,828 --> 00:37:19,637
>> IT HAS TO BE VERY GOOD. 

1287
00:37:19,637 --> 00:37:21,038
>> PROBABLY AFTER. 

1288
00:37:21,038 --> 00:37:23,307
>> THANK YOU, SIR. 

1289
00:37:23,307 --> 00:37:25,710
>> THANK YOU VERY MUCH. 

1290
00:37:25,710 --> 00:37:29,447
>> COULD BE. 

1291
00:37:29,447 --> 00:37:30,748
IT WILL BE ANNOUNCED. 

1292
00:37:30,748 --> 00:37:34,184
>> LET'S GO. 

1293
00:37:34,184 --> 00:37:35,586
LET'S KEEP GOING. 

1294
00:37:35,586 --> 00:37:38,456
>> SIR, LET'S GO. 

1295
00:37:38,456 --> 00:37:39,557
>> YOU'VE BEEN LISTENING TO 

1296
00:37:39,557 --> 00:37:40,190
PRESIDENT TRUMP ADDRESS 

1297
00:37:40,190 --> 00:37:41,625
REPORTERS AT THE WHITE HOUSE. 

1298
00:37:41,625 --> 00:37:44,829
HE GAVE MORE INFORMATION ABOUT 

1299
00:37:44,829 --> 00:37:45,429
ANTHONY KENNEDY'S RETIREMENT. 

1300
00:37:45,429 --> 00:37:46,063
HE SAID JUSTICE KENNEDY DID GO 

1301
00:37:46,063 --> 00:37:47,632
INFORM THE WHITE HOUSE TO MEET 

1302
00:37:47,632 --> 00:37:48,132
WITH THE PRESIDENT. 

1303
00:37:48,132 --> 00:37:50,167
THEY SPENT ABOUT HALF AN HOUR 

1304
00:37:50,167 --> 00:37:50,434
TALKING. 

1305
00:37:50,434 --> 00:37:52,203
AND PRESIDENT TRUMP SAID HE 

1306
00:37:52,203 --> 00:37:54,972
ASKED THE JUSTICE FOR HIS 

1307
00:37:54,972 --> 00:37:55,472
RECOMMENDATIONS FOR A 

1308
00:37:55,472 --> 00:37:55,806
REPLACEMENT. 

1309
00:37:55,806 --> 00:37:57,541
THEY DISCUSSED THE FACT THAT 

1310
00:37:57,541 --> 00:38:00,778
THERE IS A LIST OF 25 POTENTIAL 

1311
00:38:00,778 --> 00:38:01,212
CANDIDATES. 

1312
00:38:01,212 --> 00:38:03,013
THAT WAS CREATED DURING THE 

1313
00:38:03,013 --> 00:38:04,114
TRUMP CAMPAIGN. 

1314
00:38:04,114 --> 00:38:05,282
LET'S BRING IN MAJOR GARRETT, 

1315
00:38:05,282 --> 00:38:06,517
OUR CHIEF WHITE HOUSE 

1316
00:38:06,517 --> 00:38:06,884
CORRESPONDENT. 

1317
00:38:06,884 --> 00:38:07,518
MAJOR IS JOINING US FROM THE 

1318
00:38:07,518 --> 00:38:09,987
NORTH LAWN OF THE WHITE HOUSE. 

1319
00:38:09,987 --> 00:38:12,189
MAJOR, FOR OUR VIEWERS JUST 

1320
00:38:12,189 --> 00:38:14,124
JOINING US, TELL US ABOUT THIS 

1321
00:38:14,124 --> 00:38:15,760
LIST AND ITS ORIGINS. 

1322
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:17,962
>> SO IT STARTED OFF AS A 

1323
00:38:17,962 --> 00:38:19,396
GENERAL LIST OF PREFERENCES. 

1324
00:38:19,396 --> 00:38:20,497
I CAN'T REMEMBER THE EXACT 

1325
00:38:20,497 --> 00:38:24,268
NUMBER WHEN IT FIRST CAME OUT. 

1326
00:38:24,268 --> 00:38:25,970
IT WAS LIKE 13, 14, 15. 

1327
00:38:25,970 --> 00:38:29,340
THEN IT BECAME A DEFINED LIST 

1328
00:38:29,340 --> 00:38:29,707
OF 20. 

1329
00:38:29,707 --> 00:38:32,209
THEN A NAME WAS ADDED IN 

1330
00:38:32,209 --> 00:38:32,776
SEPTEMBER, OCTOBER OF 2016. 

1331
00:38:32,776 --> 00:38:33,944
THAT'S WHEN CANDIDATE TRUMP 

1332
00:38:33,944 --> 00:38:35,813
SAID THIS IS MY LIST. 

1333
00:38:35,813 --> 00:38:38,682
IF I'M ELECTED THE PERSON I 

1334
00:38:38,682 --> 00:38:40,951
NOMINATE TO FILL THE SEAT OF 

1335
00:38:40,951 --> 00:38:43,854
SCALIA WILL COME FROM THIS 

1336
00:38:43,854 --> 00:38:44,054
LIST. 

1337
00:38:44,054 --> 00:38:44,321
JUDGE ME. 

1338
00:38:44,321 --> 00:38:44,788
JUDGE MY CANDIDACY. 

1339
00:38:44,788 --> 00:38:45,689
AND IF YOU WILL, JUDGE THE 

1340
00:38:45,689 --> 00:38:48,926
FUTURE OF THE COURT BASED ON 

1341
00:38:48,926 --> 00:38:49,226
THIS LIST. 

1342
00:38:49,226 --> 00:38:52,096
AS HE WAS PRESIDENT, THAT LIST 

1343
00:38:52,096 --> 00:38:54,432
GREW TO 25. 

1344
00:38:54,432 --> 00:38:56,367
AND THE PRESIDENT REAFFIRMED 

1345
00:38:56,367 --> 00:39:00,004
THAT THAT LIST IS CENTRAL TO 

1346
00:39:00,004 --> 00:39:01,038
HIS ALREADY ESTABLISHED VETTING 

1347
00:39:01,038 --> 00:39:01,305
PROCESS. 

1348
00:39:01,305 --> 00:39:02,106
AND WHEN THE PRESIDENT IN THE 

1349
00:39:02,106 --> 00:39:04,442
EAST ROOM OF THE WHITE HOUSE 

1350
00:39:04,442 --> 00:39:05,643
VERY EARLY IN HIS PRESIDENCY, 

1351
00:39:05,643 --> 00:39:08,179
BEFORE THE END OF JANUARY, 

1352
00:39:08,179 --> 00:39:12,049
ANNOUNCED NEIL GORSUCH AS HIS 

1353
00:39:12,049 --> 00:39:12,883
NOMINEE, HE DESCRIBED HIS 

1354
00:39:12,883 --> 00:39:14,051
SELECTION PROCESS JUSTIFIABLY 

1355
00:39:14,051 --> 00:39:16,587
AS THE MOST TRANSPARENT IN 

1356
00:39:16,587 --> 00:39:16,987
AMERICAN HISTORY. 

1357
00:39:16,987 --> 00:39:17,187
WHY? 

1358
00:39:17,187 --> 00:39:19,023
BECAUSE NEVER BEFORE HAD THERE 

1359
00:39:19,023 --> 00:39:20,157
BEEN A LIST. 

1360
00:39:20,157 --> 00:39:22,125
AND THAT LIST WAS FOLLOWED. 

1361
00:39:22,125 --> 00:39:24,628
NEIL GORSUCH WAS ON THAT SECOND 

1362
00:39:24,628 --> 00:39:25,595
LIST OF 20, THEN 21. 

1363
00:39:25,595 --> 00:39:27,298
SO WHOEVER THIS NOMINEE IS AND 

1364
00:39:27,298 --> 00:39:29,266
THE PRESIDENT SAID THE PROCESS 

1365
00:39:29,266 --> 00:39:32,536
OF VETTING THE NEXT PERSON HAS 

1366
00:39:32,536 --> 00:39:33,036
BEGUN IMMEDIATELY. 

1367
00:39:33,036 --> 00:39:33,937
I WOULD ANTICIPATE THAT NAME 

1368
00:39:33,937 --> 00:39:36,240
BEING PUT FORTH WITHIN A WEEK 

1369
00:39:36,240 --> 00:39:38,042
OR TWO AT THE MOMENT IS COMING 

1370
00:39:38,042 --> 00:39:39,643
FROM THIS LIST OF 25. 

1371
00:39:39,643 --> 00:39:41,545
AND THEN AS THE PRESIDENT WAS 

1372
00:39:41,545 --> 00:39:44,748
ASKED, WELL, WHY NOT WAIT TO 

1373
00:39:44,748 --> 00:39:45,615
HAVE AN INTERVENING ELECTION. 

1374
00:39:45,615 --> 00:39:46,050
NO. 

1375
00:39:46,050 --> 00:39:46,951
WE HAVEN'T THOUGHT ABOUT THAT. 

1376
00:39:46,951 --> 00:39:49,386
THERE IS NOT ONE CHANCE THAT 

1377
00:39:49,386 --> 00:39:52,089
THIS WHITE HOUSE OR THE 

1378
00:39:52,089 --> 00:39:53,624
SYMPATHETIC AND IN SOLIDARITY 

1379
00:39:53,624 --> 00:39:55,159
SENATE REPUBLICAN LEADERSHIP 

1380
00:39:55,159 --> 00:39:55,459
WILL WAIT. 

1381
00:39:55,459 --> 00:39:57,628
AS SOON AS THE NOMINEE IS 

1382
00:39:57,628 --> 00:39:58,462
ANNOUNCED THE CONFIRMATION 

1383
00:39:58,462 --> 00:39:59,930
PROCESS WILL BEGIN EXAMINE YOU 

1384
00:39:59,930 --> 00:40:01,799
CAN BE CERTAIN THERE BE A 

1385
00:40:01,799 --> 00:40:02,600
CONFIRMATION VOTE BEFORE THE 

1386
00:40:02,600 --> 00:40:05,735
MID TERM ELECTIONS TO FILL THE 

1387
00:40:05,735 --> 00:40:05,936
SEAT. 

1388
00:40:05,936 --> 00:40:08,906
NOW, JUST MEDEVAC HABIT BY THE 

1389
00:40:08,906 --> 00:40:10,341
RETIREMENT OF JUSTICE ANTHONY 

1390
00:40:10,341 --> 00:40:10,608
KENNEDY. 

1391
00:40:10,608 --> 00:40:12,209
>> WE HEARD THE PRESIDENT 

1392
00:40:12,209 --> 00:40:15,012
MENTION THERE ARE FRONTRUNNERS 

1393
00:40:15,012 --> 00:40:16,180
THAT ARE WELL KNOWN. 

1394
00:40:16,180 --> 00:40:18,582
HE EVEN SAID THE PRESIDENT OF 

1395
00:40:18,582 --> 00:40:21,385
PORTUGAL MAY KNOW THE NAMES OF 

1396
00:40:21,385 --> 00:40:21,885
THE FRONT RUNNERS. 

1397
00:40:21,885 --> 00:40:23,854
THE PRESIDENT WAS ASKED ABOUT 

1398
00:40:23,854 --> 00:40:25,923
THE UPCOMING SUMMIT WITH 

1399
00:40:25,923 --> 00:40:26,857
PRESIDENT PUTIN OF RUSSIA. 

1400
00:40:26,857 --> 00:40:28,292
I'M WONDERING, MAJOR, HOW MUCH 

1401
00:40:28,292 --> 00:40:32,163
IS RUSSIAN INTERFERENCE IN THE 

1402
00:40:32,163 --> 00:40:33,330
U.S. ELECTION GOING TO BE 

1403
00:40:33,330 --> 00:40:34,164
HANGING OVER THIS SUMMIT. 

1404
00:40:34,164 --> 00:40:35,799
>> IT WILL HANG OVER IT FOR 

1405
00:40:35,799 --> 00:40:36,066
CERTAIN. 

1406
00:40:36,066 --> 00:40:37,234
WHEN THE PRESIDENT WAS ASKED 

1407
00:40:37,234 --> 00:40:42,706
WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO TALK 

1408
00:40:42,706 --> 00:40:42,939
ABOUT? 

1409
00:40:42,939 --> 00:40:43,573
SYRIA, UKRAINE, ANOTHER GOLDEN 

1410
00:40:43,573 --> 00:40:45,943
OPPORTUNITY FOR THE PRESIDENT 

1411
00:40:45,943 --> 00:40:48,612
TO SAY SOMETHING ABOUT RUSSIAN 

1412
00:40:48,612 --> 00:40:50,881
INTERFERENCE IN THE 2016 

1413
00:40:50,881 --> 00:40:51,348
ELECTION, THOROUGHLY 

1414
00:40:51,348 --> 00:40:51,982
ESTABLISHED. 

1415
00:40:51,982 --> 00:40:53,517
THERE IS A BODY OF EVIDENCE 

1416
00:40:53,517 --> 00:40:54,385
GROWING IN SIGNIFICANCE THAT 

1417
00:40:54,385 --> 00:40:56,520
THERE IS AT THE MARGIN SOME 

1418
00:40:56,520 --> 00:40:58,188
MECHANISMS BY WHICH USING THE 

1419
00:40:58,188 --> 00:40:59,323
SAME TACTICS RUSSIANS ARE 

1420
00:40:59,323 --> 00:41:01,592
TRYING TO INTERFERE WITH THE 

1421
00:41:01,592 --> 00:41:03,227
CONVERSATION ABOUT THE 2018 

1422
00:41:03,227 --> 00:41:03,493
ELECTION. 

1423
00:41:03,493 --> 00:41:05,796
NOT A WORD SAID FROM THE 

1424
00:41:05,796 --> 00:41:06,096
PRESIDENT. 

1425
00:41:06,096 --> 00:41:06,764
THERE ARE NUMEROUS 

1426
00:41:06,764 --> 00:41:07,565
OPPORTUNITIES. 

1427
00:41:07,565 --> 00:41:11,835
THIS IS JUST THE LATEST IN 

1428
00:41:11,835 --> 00:41:13,938
WHICH HE SERVED UP ON A PLATTER 

1429
00:41:13,938 --> 00:41:15,506
THE OPPORTUNITY TO SAY 

1430
00:41:15,506 --> 00:41:17,374
SOMETHING, JUST RECOGNIZE IT 

1431
00:41:17,374 --> 00:41:19,410
FIRST, CRITICIZE IT SECOND, 

1432
00:41:19,410 --> 00:41:21,612
ABOUT RUSSIAN INTERFERENCE IN 

1433
00:41:21,612 --> 00:41:22,045
AMERICAN POLITICS. 

1434
00:41:22,045 --> 00:41:23,347
THE PRESIDENT, AGAIN, LET THAT 

1435
00:41:23,347 --> 00:41:26,483
OPPORTUNITY LAPSE AND GO BY THE 

1436
00:41:26,483 --> 00:41:27,651
WAYSIDE. 

1437
00:41:27,651 --> 00:41:29,253
SO WHETHER THEY DISCUSS IT 

1438
00:41:29,253 --> 00:41:30,888
DIRECTLY OR NOT, IT WILL 

1439
00:41:30,888 --> 00:41:34,024
OVERHANG BECAUSE IT IS A 

1440
00:41:34,024 --> 00:41:35,326
SERIOUS ISSUE. 

1441
00:41:35,326 --> 00:41:36,593
IT'S GOT BIPARTISAN CONCERN. 

1442
00:41:36,593 --> 00:41:38,095
THERE ARE NUMEROUS ONGOING 

1443
00:41:38,095 --> 00:41:38,629
INVESTIGATIONS. 

1444
00:41:38,629 --> 00:41:40,397
SOME OF THEM JUST TECHNICAL AND 

1445
00:41:40,397 --> 00:41:40,664
TACTICAL. 

1446
00:41:40,664 --> 00:41:43,534
HOW DID IT HAPPEN, WHAT WERE 

1447
00:41:43,534 --> 00:41:43,867
THE METHODS. 

1448
00:41:43,867 --> 00:41:45,769
SOME WITH POTENTIAL CRIMINAL 

1449
00:41:45,769 --> 00:41:47,104
ASPECTS TO THEM. 

1450
00:41:47,104 --> 00:41:48,806
THE ROBERT MUELLER 

1451
00:41:48,806 --> 00:41:49,940
INVESTIGATION CERTAINLY ABOUT 

1452
00:41:49,940 --> 00:41:50,541
THIS ISSUE. 

1453
00:41:50,541 --> 00:41:52,109
LOTS OF PEOPLE HAVE GENERALIZED 

1454
00:41:52,109 --> 00:41:56,146
AND VERY SHARP CONCERNS ABOUT 

1455
00:41:56,146 --> 00:41:56,379
THIS. 

1456
00:41:56,379 --> 00:41:58,048
AND GIVEN OPPORTUNITY AFTER 

1457
00:41:58,048 --> 00:41:59,550
OPPORTUNITY AFTER OPPORTUNITY 

1458
00:41:59,550 --> 00:42:01,719
SO BOTH NOTE THAT AND TO 

1459
00:42:01,719 --> 00:42:02,486
CRITICIZE IT, PRESIDENT TRUMP 

1460
00:42:02,486 --> 00:42:04,655
HAS LEFT EVERY ONE OF THOSE 

1461
00:42:04,655 --> 00:42:05,455
OPPORTUNITIES PASS HIM BY. 

1462
00:42:05,455 --> 00:42:06,690
WHAT IS INTERESTING, IT WILL 

1463
00:42:06,690 --> 00:42:08,058
HAPPEN SOMETIME IN MID JULY ON 

1464
00:42:08,058 --> 00:42:10,494
THE OTHER SIDE OF THE TRIP TO 

1465
00:42:10,494 --> 00:42:11,027
THE NATO SUMMIT. 

1466
00:42:11,027 --> 00:42:17,968
THE TWO PLACES MOST LIKELY TO 

1467
00:42:17,968 --> 00:42:20,004
BE THE HOST, AUSTRIA AND 

1468
00:42:20,004 --> 00:42:20,271
FINLAND. 

1469
00:42:20,271 --> 00:42:25,075
PEOPLE BELIEVE IT WILL BE IN 

1470
00:42:25,075 --> 00:42:26,243
FINLAND FOR GEOGRAPHIC 

1471
00:42:26,243 --> 00:42:26,510
PURPOSES. 

1472
00:42:26,510 --> 00:42:28,946
FOR THE PRESIDENT TO GET THERE 

1473
00:42:28,946 --> 00:42:29,780
AND PRESIDENT PUTIN TO GET 

1474
00:42:29,780 --> 00:42:32,616
THERE AND GET BACK FOR THE 

1475
00:42:32,616 --> 00:42:32,916
WORLD CUP. 

1476
00:42:32,916 --> 00:42:33,951
I WOULD THINK THAT FINLAND WILL 

1477
00:42:33,951 --> 00:42:35,085
PROBABLY BE THE PLACE THAT IT 

1478
00:42:35,085 --> 00:42:35,352
WILL BE. 

1479
00:42:35,352 --> 00:42:36,654
>> THE ONE THING THAT THE 

1480
00:42:36,654 --> 00:42:38,389
PRESIDENT DID SAY ON THE TOPIC 

1481
00:42:38,389 --> 00:42:39,390
OF RUSSIA WAS SIMPLY THEY'RE 

1482
00:42:39,390 --> 00:42:41,492
DOING A GREAT JOB WITH THE 

1483
00:42:41,492 --> 00:42:41,792
WORLD CUP. 

1484
00:42:41,792 --> 00:42:44,061
NOTHING WE HEARD THERE ABOUT 

1485
00:42:44,061 --> 00:42:45,095
RUSSIAN INTERFERENCE. 

1486
00:42:45,095 --> 00:42:47,565
NOW, COMING BACK TO JUSTICE 

1487
00:42:47,565 --> 00:42:52,970
KENNEDY, SENATE MAJORITY LEADER 

1488
00:42:52,970 --> 00:43:01,945
MITCH NOT -- MITCH MCCONNELL 

1489
00:43:01,945 --> 00:43:03,380
SAID THEY WILL PROCEED 

1490
00:43:03,380 --> 00:43:03,947
IMMEDIATELY. 

1491
00:43:03,947 --> 00:43:04,981
>> THERE ARE PROCEDURAL THINGS 

1492
00:43:04,981 --> 00:43:07,651
THAT YOU CAN SLOW THINGS DOWN 

1493
00:43:07,651 --> 00:43:08,686
BUT I GUARANTEE YOU IF 

1494
00:43:08,686 --> 00:43:09,453
REPUBLICANS INTO TOWED HAVE 

1495
00:43:09,453 --> 00:43:10,220
OVERNIGHT SESSIONS OR WEEKEND 

1496
00:43:10,220 --> 00:43:11,522
SESSIONS JUST TO RUN OUT THE 

1497
00:43:11,522 --> 00:43:13,190
CLOCK, THEY WILL DO IT. 

1498
00:43:13,190 --> 00:43:15,125
WHAT EVER IS REQUIRED UNDER 

1499
00:43:15,125 --> 00:43:17,328
SENATE PROCEDURES TO GET THE 

1500
00:43:17,328 --> 00:43:19,697
HEARINGS HELD, THE VOTE THROUGH 

1501
00:43:19,697 --> 00:43:20,998
THE COMMITTEE, WHICH IS THE 

1502
00:43:20,998 --> 00:43:21,966
JUDICIARY COMMITTEE, AND THEN 

1503
00:43:21,966 --> 00:43:24,068
THE FLOOR VOTE TO HAVE 

1504
00:43:24,068 --> 00:43:24,668
CONFIRMATION, SENATE 

1505
00:43:24,668 --> 00:43:26,537
REPUBLICANS WILL DO IT TO GET 

1506
00:43:26,537 --> 00:43:28,973
THIS JUSTICE ON THE BENCH. 

1507
00:43:28,973 --> 00:43:31,208
TO REPLACE KENNEDY, AND TO HAVE 

1508
00:43:31,208 --> 00:43:34,044
A SECOND TRUMP PERSON ON THE 

1509
00:43:34,044 --> 00:43:37,281
SUPREME COURT. 

1510
00:43:37,281 --> 00:43:37,781
THEREBY ESTABLISHING A 

1511
00:43:37,781 --> 00:43:38,849
SUBSTANTIAL LEGACY ALREADY 

1512
00:43:38,849 --> 00:43:41,018
BEFORE THE END OF HIS SECOND 

1513
00:43:41,018 --> 00:43:43,287
YEAR IN OFFICE, NOT ONLY ON THE 

1514
00:43:43,287 --> 00:43:44,288
SUPREME COURT BUT I THINK JAN 

1515
00:43:44,288 --> 00:43:45,188
MADE REFERENCE TO THIS. 

1516
00:43:45,188 --> 00:43:48,626
IF SHE DIDN'T, I WILL MAKE THE 

1517
00:43:48,626 --> 00:43:48,926
POINT NOW. 

1518
00:43:48,926 --> 00:43:50,360
NO PRESIDENT IN AMERICAN 

1519
00:43:50,360 --> 00:43:54,331
HISTORY HAS NOMINATED AND SEEN 

1520
00:43:54,331 --> 00:43:55,432
CONFIRMED MORE APPELLATE 

1521
00:43:55,432 --> 00:43:57,101
JUSTICES ON THE FEDERAL BENCH 

1522
00:43:57,101 --> 00:43:57,601
THAN PRESIDENT TRUMP. 

1523
00:43:57,601 --> 00:44:00,204
THAT IS ANOTHER WAY IN WHICH HE 

1524
00:44:00,204 --> 00:44:00,837
IS RESHAPING THE FEDERAL 

1525
00:44:00,837 --> 00:44:01,137
JUDICIARY. 

1526
00:44:01,137 --> 00:44:02,005
NOT JUST AT THE SUPREME COURT 

1527
00:44:02,005 --> 00:44:04,374
BUT AT THE APPEAL AT COURTS. 

1528
00:44:04,374 --> 00:44:05,976
AND THERE ARE LOTS OF TRUMP 

1529
00:44:05,976 --> 00:44:07,377
NOMINEE THAT'S HAVE BEEN 

1530
00:44:07,377 --> 00:44:10,581
SUBMITTED AND APPROVED FOR 

1531
00:44:10,581 --> 00:44:11,315
DISTRICT COURT POSITIONS AS 

1532
00:44:11,315 --> 00:44:11,615
WELL. 

1533
00:44:11,615 --> 00:44:15,653
SO ALREADY THERE IS A TRUMP 

1534
00:44:15,653 --> 00:44:18,088
LEGACY ON THE FEDERAL BENCH. 

1535
00:44:18,088 --> 00:44:20,257
A SECOND SUPREME COURT NOMINEE 

1536
00:44:20,257 --> 00:44:20,824
WILL EVEN MORE. 

1537
00:44:20,824 --> 00:44:29,767
>> DO YOU THINK THIS WILL 

1538
00:44:29,767 --> 00:44:31,168
EMBOLDEN, KNOWING THAT TWO 

1539
00:44:31,168 --> 00:44:32,135
JUDGES WERE HAND PICKED BY HIM. 

1540
00:44:32,135 --> 00:44:34,438
>> THAT IS SOMETHING THAT THE 

1541
00:44:34,438 --> 00:44:34,971
DEMOCRATS WILL SUGGEST. 

1542
00:44:34,971 --> 00:44:37,341
YOU WILL HAVE TO WAIT AND SEE 

1543
00:44:37,341 --> 00:44:37,874
HOW THINGS SHAKE OUT. 

1544
00:44:37,874 --> 00:44:40,744
THE PRESIDENT AND THE SUPREME 

1545
00:44:40,744 --> 00:44:41,879
COURT DECISION ON THE TRAVEL 

1546
00:44:41,879 --> 00:44:44,214
BAN SAID SOMETHING THAT I THINK 

1547
00:44:44,214 --> 00:44:45,248
WAS IMPORTANT. 

1548
00:44:45,248 --> 00:44:46,116
SEPARATE FROM WHO DONALD TRUMP 

1549
00:44:46,116 --> 00:44:48,652
IS AND WHAT DONALD TRUMP SAID 

1550
00:44:48,652 --> 00:44:49,519
ABOUT IMMIGRATION POLICY. 

1551
00:44:49,519 --> 00:44:51,722
THE SUPREME COURT SAID LONG 

1552
00:44:51,722 --> 00:44:52,255
BEFORE DONALD TRUMP THE 

1553
00:44:52,255 --> 00:44:55,492
CONSTITUTION OF THE UNITED 

1554
00:44:55,492 --> 00:44:56,059
STATES INVESTED TREMENDOUS 

1555
00:44:56,059 --> 00:44:57,628
AUTHORITY IN THE PRESIDENT OF 

1556
00:44:57,628 --> 00:44:58,061
THE UNITED STATES. 

1557
00:44:58,061 --> 00:45:00,864
AND THE OFFICE OF THE 

1558
00:45:00,864 --> 00:45:02,466
PRESIDENCY TO DEAL WITH 

1559
00:45:02,466 --> 00:45:05,869
IMMIGRATION POLICY GENERALLY 

1560
00:45:05,869 --> 00:45:07,838
AND VERY SPECIFICALLY TO HAVE 

1561
00:45:07,838 --> 00:45:09,072
WIDE LATITUDE ON QUESTIONS OF 

1562
00:45:09,072 --> 00:45:11,575
IMMIGRATION POLICY AS THEY 

1563
00:45:11,575 --> 00:45:12,242
RELATE TODAY NATIONAL SECURITY. 

1564
00:45:12,242 --> 00:45:13,377
THE SUPREME COURT WENT OUT OF 

1565
00:45:13,377 --> 00:45:17,881
ITS WAY TO SAY THIS WAS A 

1566
00:45:17,881 --> 00:45:18,648
PREEXISTING CONSTITUTIONAL 

1567
00:45:18,648 --> 00:45:19,516
PREROGATIVE OF EVERY PRESIDENT. 

1568
00:45:19,516 --> 00:45:20,751
REGARDLESS OF WHO THE OCCUPANT 

1569
00:45:20,751 --> 00:45:23,053
IS NOW AND REGARDLESS OF WHAT 

1570
00:45:23,053 --> 00:45:24,388
THAT OCCUPANT SAID AS A 

1571
00:45:24,388 --> 00:45:25,589
CANDIDATE OR AS PRESIDENT, THIS 

1572
00:45:25,589 --> 00:45:26,223
AUTHORITY HAS ALWAYS BEEN 

1573
00:45:26,223 --> 00:45:27,991
THERE. 

1574
00:45:27,991 --> 00:45:32,129
SO THE QUESTION FOR THE SUPREME 

1575
00:45:32,129 --> 00:45:34,431
COURT WAS, DID TRAVEL BAN 3.0 

1576
00:45:34,431 --> 00:45:35,866
FALL WITHIN THAT LONG 

1577
00:45:35,866 --> 00:45:37,000
ESTABLISHED LEGAL AUTHORITY. 

1578
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:39,369
THE SUPREME COURT BY A 5-4 

1579
00:45:39,369 --> 00:45:40,470
NARROW MAJORITY, I GRANT YOU, 

1580
00:45:40,470 --> 00:45:44,274
SAID YES, IT DID. 

1581
00:45:44,274 --> 00:45:48,512
SO TO ASK THE QUESTION, WAS THE 

1582
00:45:48,512 --> 00:45:50,180
PRESIDENT EMBOLDENED IN THE 

1583
00:45:50,180 --> 00:45:50,581
FIRST PLACE? 

1584
00:45:50,581 --> 00:45:52,015
KNOW THOUGHT HE HAD THAT POWER. 

1585
00:45:52,015 --> 00:45:53,784
IT TURNS OUT UNDER THE THIRD 

1586
00:45:53,784 --> 00:45:56,420
VARIATION OF THE TRAVEL BAN IN 

1587
00:45:56,420 --> 00:45:57,120
FACT HE DID. 

1588
00:45:57,120 --> 00:45:58,655
IF HE TRIED THAT ON TRAVEL BAN 

1589
00:45:58,655 --> 00:46:00,691
1 AND 2, HE WOULD HAVE FAILED 

1590
00:46:00,691 --> 00:46:02,125
BECAUSE THE SUPREME COURT'S 

1591
00:46:02,125 --> 00:46:03,894
DECISION MADE IT PRETTY CLEAR, 

1592
00:46:03,894 --> 00:46:05,329
EVEN THOUGH IT DIDN'T SAY 

1593
00:46:05,329 --> 00:46:06,630
EXPLICITLY, NEITHER ONE OF THE 

1594
00:46:06,630 --> 00:46:11,869
FIRST TWO TRAVEL BAN VARIATIONS 

1595
00:46:11,869 --> 00:46:12,803
WOULD HAVE PASSED 

1596
00:46:12,803 --> 00:46:13,336
CONSTITUTIONAL SCRUTINY. 

1597
00:46:13,336 --> 00:46:18,008
SO THAT IN ITSELF IS AN EXAMPLE 

1598
00:46:18,008 --> 00:46:21,378
OF HOW THE PRESIDENT DIDN'T 

1599
00:46:21,378 --> 00:46:22,713
NECESSARILY FEEL EMBOLDEED AND 

1600
00:46:22,713 --> 00:46:24,581
HAD TO REWORK HIS OWN POLICY. 

1601
00:46:24,581 --> 00:46:26,183
SO EVERY PRESIDENT HAS TO LOOK 

1602
00:46:26,183 --> 00:46:28,886
AT EXISTING LAW AND THE WAY 

1603
00:46:28,886 --> 00:46:31,121
THAT THE SUPREME COURT HAS 

1604
00:46:31,121 --> 00:46:31,821
HISTORICALLY DEALT WITH CASES. 

1605
00:46:31,821 --> 00:46:33,857
AND PLENTY OF PRESIDENTS HAVE 

1606
00:46:33,857 --> 00:46:34,658
LEARNED JUST BECAUSE YOU 

1607
00:46:34,658 --> 00:46:36,293
NOMINATE AND SEE CONFIRMED ON 

1608
00:46:36,293 --> 00:46:37,628
YOUR WATCH SOMEONE ON THE 

1609
00:46:37,628 --> 00:46:38,562
SUPREME COURT DOESN'T MEAN 

1610
00:46:38,562 --> 00:46:39,763
THEY'RE GOING TO BE AND IT 

1611
00:46:39,763 --> 00:46:41,965
DOESN'T MEAN THAT THEY OUGHT TO 

1612
00:46:41,965 --> 00:46:44,935
BE A RELIABLE VOTE ON BEHALF OF 

1613
00:46:44,935 --> 00:46:45,369
YOUR AGENDA. 

1614
00:46:45,369 --> 00:46:46,770
LOTS OF PRESIDENTS HAVE BEEN 

1615
00:46:46,770 --> 00:46:47,571
BURNED BY THAT. 

1616
00:46:47,571 --> 00:46:49,339
MORE OF THEM REPUBLICAN THAN 

1617
00:46:49,339 --> 00:46:50,040
DEMOCRAT IN RECENT TIMES. 

1618
00:46:50,040 --> 00:46:51,341
BUT THAT IS ALWAYS SOMETHING 

1619
00:46:51,341 --> 00:46:53,310
THAT PRESIDENTS HAVE IN THE 

1620
00:46:53,310 --> 00:46:53,910
BACK OF THEIR MINDS. 

1621
00:46:53,910 --> 00:46:55,412
SO I'M NOT SURE THAT I WOULD BE 

1622
00:46:55,412 --> 00:46:57,648
PREPARED TO SAY THAT THE 

1623
00:46:57,648 --> 00:47:03,587
PRESIDENT WOULD OR WOULD NOT 

1624
00:47:03,587 --> 00:47:04,454
FEEL EMBOLDENED. 

1625
00:47:04,454 --> 00:47:09,960
IT WILL BE UP TO THE VOTERS TO 

1626
00:47:09,960 --> 00:47:10,193
DECIDE. 

1627
00:47:10,193 --> 00:47:12,729
>> THANK YOU FOR THAT ANALYSIS. 

1628
00:47:12,729 --> 00:47:14,197
FOR NOW A QUICK BREAK. 

1629
00:47:14,197 --> 00:00:00,000
YOU'RE STREAMING CBSN.
