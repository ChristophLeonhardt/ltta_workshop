1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,589
so I<font color="#E5E5E5"> just saw the Steve Jobs film which</font>

2
00:00:01,589 --> 00:00:04,110
I thought was exquisite it was one of

3
00:00:04,110 --> 00:00:06,330
those<font color="#E5E5E5"> films were left not having the</font>

4
00:00:06,330 --> 00:00:08,820
worked to talk about<font color="#E5E5E5"> it so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> naturally i'm</font>

5
00:00:08,820 --> 00:00:10,440
going to walk and<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk about it bit too</font>

6
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:11,940
close something that I'm realizing rest

7
00:00:11,940 --> 00:00:13,380
of me is that my<font color="#E5E5E5"> favorite films and</font>

8
00:00:13,380 --> 00:00:16,170
favorite programs my favorite general

9
00:00:16,170 --> 00:00:18,660
things are anything<font color="#CCCCCC"> that has clearly</font>

10
00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:21,180
made and clearly demonstrates an

11
00:00:21,180 --> 00:00:23,820
ensemble that celebrates the Istanbul

12
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:26,849
and that gives<font color="#E5E5E5"> us that kind of balance</font>

13
00:00:26,849 --> 00:00:31,019
to the performance<font color="#CCCCCC"> that includes</font>

14
00:00:31,019 --> 00:00:32,729
everyone in a way I don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> know if that</font>

15
00:00:32,729 --> 00:00:34,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">makes a lot of sense even though it was</font>

16
00:00:34,590 --> 00:00:37,860
clearly about this one person it was

17
00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:39,870
more than that it was a look into the

18
00:00:39,870 --> 00:00:41,629
people that surrounded him and they were

19
00:00:41,629 --> 00:00:45,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">secondary of secondary importance even</font>

20
00:00:45,180 --> 00:00:46,980
though you have that<font color="#E5E5E5"> very clear</font>

21
00:00:46,980 --> 00:00:49,590
perspective of<font color="#CCCCCC"> Steve Jobs another's</font>

22
00:00:49,590 --> 00:00:51,090
cultural figure who we think of as a

23
00:00:51,090 --> 00:00:52,980
singular figure rather than in the

24
00:00:52,980 --> 00:00:54,809
context of the ensemble<font color="#E5E5E5"> or at least</font>

25
00:00:54,809 --> 00:00:56,699
culturally<font color="#CCCCCC"> or at least misset select the</font>

26
00:00:56,699 --> 00:00:58,440
media perception of him and yet it was

27
00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:00,559
an ensemble it was so textured it was so

28
00:01:00,559 --> 00:01:03,930
precise and yet you really got the

29
00:01:03,930 --> 00:01:05,729
feeling of the atmosphere<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's split</font>

30
00:01:05,729 --> 00:01:07,140
into three acts and I won't you know

31
00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:08,850
spoil and I think it<font color="#E5E5E5"> was as long as a</font>

32
00:01:08,850 --> 00:01:11,850
metal<font color="#E5E5E5"> detector to me but it also behaved</font>

33
00:01:11,850 --> 00:01:14,760
like a play and again<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's something</font>

34
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:16,650
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I really like about Aristotle's</font>

35
00:01:16,650 --> 00:01:18,210
writing it is also<font color="#E5E5E5"> something that I</font>

36
00:01:18,210 --> 00:01:19,619
think Danny Boyle does exceptionally

37
00:01:19,619 --> 00:01:22,830
well and I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think this film though felt</font>

38
00:01:22,830 --> 00:01:25,380
like something very different from them

39
00:01:25,380 --> 00:01:28,350
both<font color="#E5E5E5"> because it wasn't an ego project it</font>

40
00:01:28,350 --> 00:01:29,850
doesn't feel like<font color="#E5E5E5"> an eagle project I</font>

41
00:01:29,850 --> 00:01:31,860
just felt like they wanted to tell this

42
00:01:31,860 --> 00:01:34,120
particular story and

43
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:38,020
ease they wanted to<font color="#E5E5E5"> show these people</font>

44
00:01:38,020 --> 00:01:40,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">they wanted to show a slice of what</font>

45
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:42,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">these people are it was also incredibly</font>

46
00:01:42,490 --> 00:01:45,040
emotional on<font color="#CCCCCC"> Sony different level so one</font>

47
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:47,320
because we only ever had Apple Macs and

48
00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:50,260
my family my dad absolutely loved apple

49
00:01:50,260 --> 00:01:53,290
<font color="#CCCCCC">and he celebrated apple and even when as</font>

50
00:01:53,290 --> 00:01:55,630
a young kid I was like where we have a

51
00:01:55,630 --> 00:01:58,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">PC cuz on pc i can maybe before the sims</font>

52
00:01:58,150 --> 00:01:59,680
and I Canada because it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> more expensive</font>

53
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:02,050
I remember getting the imax<font color="#E5E5E5"> i remembered</font>

54
00:02:02,050 --> 00:02:03,760
there's sort of ravenous hunger with

55
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:05,650
which point out sort them and strangely

56
00:02:05,650 --> 00:02:07,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">there even pictures of steve jobs</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> they</font>

57
00:02:07,090 --> 00:02:09,610
<font color="#CCCCCC">look exactly like my dad it's incredibly</font>

58
00:02:09,610 --> 00:02:11,380
weird and<font color="#E5E5E5"> i do think i'm reading too</font>

59
00:02:11,380 --> 00:02:12,940
much into it to say<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's a film</font>

60
00:02:12,940 --> 00:02:15,400
about fatherhood and all different<font color="#CCCCCC"> kinds</font>

61
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:17,260
of fatherhood but as acting or that it

62
00:02:17,260 --> 00:02:18,580
also<font color="#E5E5E5"> made me think a lot about the</font>

63
00:02:18,580 --> 00:02:20,740
immense changes and the possibilities

64
00:02:20,740 --> 00:02:24,070
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> the whole world that computers have</font>

65
00:02:24,070 --> 00:02:27,760
given me in my<font color="#CCCCCC"> life personally and the</font>

66
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:30,160
friends and and the creative fulfillment

67
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:37,810
but also the ability to do my work and<font color="#E5E5E5"> i</font>

68
00:02:37,810 --> 00:02:39,160
don't mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> that necessarily</font>

69
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:42,940
professionally but took to create what<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

70
00:02:42,940 --> 00:02:46,000
want to create to put words<font color="#E5E5E5"> to things to</font>

71
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,570
make things out of the pieces that i

72
00:02:49,570 --> 00:02:51,459
find like that's what computers have

73
00:02:51,459 --> 00:02:53,730
given me and that's something that i

74
00:02:53,730 --> 00:02:57,670
think is is celebrated with in kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

75
00:02:57,670 --> 00:02:59,709
quiet way in<font color="#E5E5E5"> steve jobs and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i'd also</font>

76
00:02:59,709 --> 00:03:02,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">didn't expect that to be the case i also</font>

77
00:03:02,050 --> 00:03:03,070
thought that it was incredibly

78
00:03:03,070 --> 00:03:04,600
structurally sound and that is something

79
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:06,010
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I really struggle with I have a</font>

80
00:03:06,010 --> 00:03:07,840
terrible sense of structure so when I

81
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:09,340
see it done right in any form of

82
00:03:09,340 --> 00:03:11,739
storytelling I have great<font color="#CCCCCC"> admiration for</font>

83
00:03:11,739 --> 00:03:13,090
it why don't you say something about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

84
00:03:13,090 --> 00:03:14,320
word that keeps going to mind for me

85
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:14,750
English

86
00:03:14,750 --> 00:03:17,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">precisely because</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that there has</font>

87
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:20,150
recently been a real focus and I would

88
00:03:20,150 --> 00:03:23,480
always say an obsession with realism in

89
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:26,630
a very literal sense in a very dry kind

90
00:03:26,630 --> 00:03:28,520
of sense it's kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of like we're so used</font>

91
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:31,220
to having<font color="#E5E5E5"> things in this very high</font>

92
00:03:31,220 --> 00:03:33,340
definition<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're trying so hard to</font>

93
00:03:33,340 --> 00:03:36,770
rehear it the way things look and feel

94
00:03:36,770 --> 00:03:38,630
from<font color="#CCCCCC"> the human eye</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> from a human</font>

95
00:03:38,630 --> 00:03:42,650
experience<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we forget communally I</font>

96
00:03:42,650 --> 00:03:46,430
think that that's not necessarily<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

97
00:03:46,430 --> 00:03:50,120
purpose of the things<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we experience</font>

98
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:52,250
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> things that we create and things</font>

99
00:03:52,250 --> 00:03:55,730
that we experience I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think we lose a lot</font>

100
00:03:55,730 --> 00:03:57,650
when<font color="#CCCCCC"> the only</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> style that is culturally</font>

101
00:03:57,650 --> 00:04:02,900
acceptable to us is realism as someone

102
00:04:02,900 --> 00:04:05,060
who is huge lover of magical realism but

103
00:04:05,060 --> 00:04:08,540
also someone who is<font color="#E5E5E5"> usually Rufus</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

104
00:04:08,540 --> 00:04:11,350
poetry of heightened language

105
00:04:11,350 --> 00:04:14,090
experiences being presented in different

106
00:04:14,090 --> 00:04:16,310
ways interpreted by different people

107
00:04:16,310 --> 00:04:18,589
because that adds something because it

108
00:04:18,589 --> 00:04:20,660
says<font color="#E5E5E5"> something</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> different it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> doesn't have</font>

109
00:04:20,660 --> 00:04:23,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">to be realistic doesn't have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be 2d</font>

110
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:25,840
but it also doesn't have to be like

111
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:28,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">forging all sensors at all times so when</font>

112
00:04:28,820 --> 00:04:30,770
I say precise and when I say it's like a

113
00:04:30,770 --> 00:04:34,490
play a big part of that<font color="#CCCCCC"> is seeing where</font>

114
00:04:34,490 --> 00:04:36,230
someone is standing the way that they're

115
00:04:36,230 --> 00:04:38,150
standing which may not<font color="#CCCCCC"> be a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> quote</font>

116
00:04:38,150 --> 00:04:40,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">unquote natural pose and maybe in a</font>

117
00:04:40,340 --> 00:04:43,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">quote unquote documentary situation they</font>

118
00:04:43,460 --> 00:04:45,380
wouldn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> stand in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that exact position</font>

119
00:04:45,380 --> 00:04:46,700
there's a scene where Jeff Daniels

120
00:04:46,700 --> 00:04:48,730
character is standing facing away and

121
00:04:48,730 --> 00:04:51,560
the choice to do that like the choice to

122
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:53,540
place him in that position<font color="#E5E5E5"> and the</font>

123
00:04:53,540 --> 00:04:55,940
choice for him to stand that that is not

124
00:04:55,940 --> 00:04:59,690
<font color="#CCCCCC">a realistic choice but it is a creative</font>

125
00:04:59,690 --> 00:05:03,169
choice and I don't know it just in this

126
00:05:03,169 --> 00:05:04,490
might sound really obvious now that I'm

127
00:05:04,490 --> 00:05:06,620
saying it sounds<font color="#E5E5E5"> really obvious but I</font>

128
00:05:06,620 --> 00:05:11,290
feel like<font color="#E5E5E5"> we have lost we've lost the</font>

129
00:05:11,290 --> 00:05:14,210
weave communally lost the ability to see

130
00:05:14,210 --> 00:05:15,919
that as something valuable in and of

131
00:05:15,919 --> 00:05:19,220
itself aside from whether or not it's

132
00:05:19,220 --> 00:05:22,340
realistic and I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> realism is a</font>

133
00:05:22,340 --> 00:05:24,099
really

134
00:05:24,099 --> 00:05:27,470
barometer for creative experience and

135
00:05:27,470 --> 00:05:29,210
creative production because you can't

136
00:05:29,210 --> 00:05:31,849
present something entirely realistically

137
00:05:31,849 --> 00:05:36,590
and and what realism means isn't making

138
00:05:36,590 --> 00:05:39,530
it exactly the way it happened because

139
00:05:39,530 --> 00:05:41,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">we all have different memories of how</font>

140
00:05:41,990 --> 00:05:43,879
<font color="#E5E5E5">something happened and you don't</font>

141
00:05:43,879 --> 00:05:45,889
experience things only<font color="#E5E5E5"> through your eyes</font>

142
00:05:45,889 --> 00:05:48,530
who experience them through that feeling

143
00:05:48,530 --> 00:05:51,259
<font color="#E5E5E5">planta ribs you experience them through</font>

144
00:05:51,259 --> 00:05:54,580
the way someone made<font color="#CCCCCC"> you feel and threw</font>

145
00:05:54,580 --> 00:05:57,139
the weigh-in event stuff<font color="#E5E5E5"> like there's</font>

146
00:05:57,139 --> 00:05:59,030
something<font color="#CCCCCC"> very</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> intangible and textured</font>

147
00:05:59,030 --> 00:06:00,889
about this girl for me I really<font color="#CCCCCC"> do feel</font>

148
00:06:00,889 --> 00:06:05,050
like I have lost the ability to explain

149
00:06:05,050 --> 00:06:07,849
things that i love but i also think<font color="#E5E5E5"> look</font>

150
00:06:07,849 --> 00:06:09,560
part of that was because this film did

151
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:12,259
take my breath away a little bit you

152
00:06:12,259 --> 00:06:13,819
know why it was so different I don't

153
00:06:13,819 --> 00:06:15,379
know what about it was so different I

154
00:06:15,379 --> 00:06:17,319
<font color="#CCCCCC">don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know whether it was just this like</font>

155
00:06:17,319 --> 00:06:20,560
intersection of of circles and just

156
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:25,819
filming in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the middle of what I like to</font>

157
00:06:25,819 --> 00:06:28,190
watch and this very life emotional

158
00:06:28,190 --> 00:06:33,550
moment and this this<font color="#E5E5E5"> significant thing</font>

159
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:35,660
twenty percent contemporary human

160
00:06:35,660 --> 00:06:40,220
history the computer and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> internet</font>

161
00:06:40,220 --> 00:06:43,009
and the way we interact with<font color="#E5E5E5"> people the</font>

162
00:06:43,009 --> 00:06:45,229
way we make things<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm going on like a</font>

mute delete right now performance-wise

164
00:06:46,940 --> 00:06:48,590
<font color="#CCCCCC">Kate Winslet has long been one of my</font>

165
00:06:48,590 --> 00:06:50,419
<font color="#E5E5E5">favorite actresses and I think that she</font>

166
00:06:50,419 --> 00:06:52,460
especially stepped it up for this<font color="#CCCCCC"> so</font>

167
00:06:52,460 --> 00:06:54,080
there's an incredible<font color="#CCCCCC"> counter</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> character</font>

168
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:55,759
and that<font color="#E5E5E5"> clearly comes from her as well</font>

169
00:06:55,759 --> 00:06:58,520
as from the writing that doesn't put her

170
00:06:58,520 --> 00:07:00,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">sack into anyone even though she is not</font>

171
00:07:00,590 --> 00:07:02,389
the title<font color="#E5E5E5"> character even though I would</font>

172
00:07:02,389 --> 00:07:03,800
have loved that I would love a film

173
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:06,259
about her it doesn't feel<font color="#CCCCCC"> like it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

174
00:07:06,259 --> 00:07:07,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">a film about you know there are so many</font>

175
00:07:07,910 --> 00:07:09,979
things that I'm seeing right now why

176
00:07:09,979 --> 00:07:12,530
<font color="#CCCCCC">even though there is a fantastic woman</font>

177
00:07:12,530 --> 00:07:14,419
there<font color="#E5E5E5"> and she's strong she's still step</font>

178
00:07:14,419 --> 00:07:16,669
into the main and this didn't feel like

179
00:07:16,669 --> 00:07:18,770
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> she wasn't the means to an end she</font>

180
00:07:18,770 --> 00:07:20,570
was like a driving force in herself and

181
00:07:20,570 --> 00:07:22,970
yeah I<font color="#CCCCCC"> was really really impressed by</font>

182
00:07:22,970 --> 00:07:24,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">that in as much as I spoke about how</font>

183
00:07:24,410 --> 00:07:26,509
excited it was about this film I was<font color="#CCCCCC"> so</font>

184
00:07:26,509 --> 00:07:28,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">scared I was going to just like it I did</font>

185
00:07:28,370 --> 00:07:29,750
feel that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I was</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> either going to love it</font>

186
00:07:29,750 --> 00:07:31,910
or hate her but I didn't think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that I</font>

187
00:07:31,910 --> 00:07:34,070
would leave with this this feeling that

188
00:07:34,070 --> 00:07:35,810
I have right now<font color="#CCCCCC"> I didn't think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that I</font>

189
00:07:35,810 --> 00:07:37,400
would leave with this deep<font color="#E5E5E5"> draw to it</font>

190
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:40,820
but then also this need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to kind of see</font>

191
00:07:40,820 --> 00:07:44,200
it more and more and more and<font color="#E5E5E5"> understand</font>

192
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:46,450
they<font color="#CCCCCC"> made it you know to understand how</font>

193
00:07:46,450 --> 00:07:48,790
they made<font color="#CCCCCC"> it happen the only other thing</font>

194
00:07:48,790 --> 00:07:49,990
that I can think that I have that

195
00:07:49,990 --> 00:07:52,780
feeling for in any way similar to it is

196
00:07:52,780 --> 00:07:55,210
the West room because again that's

197
00:07:55,210 --> 00:07:57,880
that's that's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> balance as a balance</font>

198
00:07:57,880 --> 00:08:00,400
that in the best episodes in the best

199
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:02,890
moments the tone is just right the

200
00:08:02,890 --> 00:08:04,840
rhythm is just right the actor was just

201
00:08:04,840 --> 00:08:06,910
absolutely<font color="#CCCCCC"> on point</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I yes I finished the</font>

202
00:08:06,910 --> 00:08:08,650
film wanting to see it immediately again

203
00:08:08,650 --> 00:08:11,020
in fact I would have stayed in the

204
00:08:11,020 --> 00:08:13,090
cinema and watched it once again<font color="#E5E5E5"> back to</font>

205
00:08:13,090 --> 00:08:15,460
back but I had to be getting on<font color="#CCCCCC"> with my</font>

206
00:08:15,460 --> 00:08:18,340
<font color="#CCCCCC">day and enjoying some fun on the lake</font>

207
00:08:18,340 --> 00:08:20,590
shore to<font color="#CCCCCC"> shore I don't want to make</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

208
00:08:20,590 --> 00:08:22,240
all about my dad because it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not this</font>

209
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:24,280
this feeling that I have after it isn't

210
00:08:24,280 --> 00:08:26,020
entirely about this my life isn't

211
00:08:26,020 --> 00:08:28,390
entirely about this loss that happened

212
00:08:28,390 --> 00:08:31,210
four years ago it<font color="#CCCCCC"> is something different</font>

213
00:08:31,210 --> 00:08:33,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">to that but it definitely does give you</font>

214
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:35,320
a different filter through which you see

215
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:38,080
your experiences I think losing a parent

216
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:40,000
does that and then having a sort of

217
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,830
disconnection from it i think<font color="#E5E5E5"> does</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

218
00:08:41,830 --> 00:08:44,410
too and<font color="#CCCCCC"> i think it's only really now</font>

219
00:08:44,410 --> 00:08:46,960
that I'm properly<font color="#E5E5E5"> processing a lot of it</font>

220
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:48,940
when I finish the film<font color="#E5E5E5"> I also did Phil</font>

221
00:08:48,940 --> 00:08:50,500
metzli sad that I can't show it to him

222
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:52,270
and I'm in Toronto and he was going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

223
00:08:52,270 --> 00:08:53,980
take<font color="#E5E5E5"> US Canada and I didn't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font>

224
00:08:53,980 --> 00:08:55,780
probably would have just lightened that

225
00:08:55,780 --> 00:09:00,520
I think it's it it captured the

226
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:05,110
importance of what the contribution that

227
00:09:05,110 --> 00:09:09,070
that man had to my dad's life to my life

228
00:09:09,070 --> 00:09:11,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">and that i would have liked him to have</font>

229
00:09:11,230 --> 00:09:14,860
seen it so it's it's it's very strange

230
00:09:14,860 --> 00:09:16,060
when you just realize all the things

231
00:09:16,060 --> 00:09:20,380
that that time just things go on the

232
00:09:20,380 --> 00:09:23,950
other thing things continue and things

233
00:09:23,950 --> 00:09:26,120
continue to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be made that</font>

234
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:29,210
it feels astonishingly underfed<font color="#CCCCCC"> some</font>

235
00:09:29,210 --> 00:09:31,790
people won't be<font color="#E5E5E5"> able to see use but so</font>

236
00:09:31,790 --> 00:09:34,100
it goes anyway<font color="#E5E5E5"> I am now going to look</font>

237
00:09:34,100 --> 00:09:36,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">around in the Sun and enjoy it and think</font>

238
00:09:36,830 --> 00:09:40,070
<font color="#CCCCCC">about films that I really loved and look</font>

239
00:09:40,070 --> 00:09:41,900
forward<font color="#E5E5E5"> to seeing it again but then also</font>

240
00:09:41,900 --> 00:09:45,080
make the most of my last 12 hours or so

241
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:47,990
in Toronto and I've been filming a lot

242
00:09:47,990 --> 00:09:49,520
I've been filming a lot of so many

243
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:52,220
things and editing none of it but I hope

244
00:09:52,220 --> 00:09:53,660
you're all doing well and not carry the

245
00:09:53,660 --> 00:09:55,610
conversation on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the toilet for sure I</font>

246
00:09:55,610 --> 00:09:58,760
wish selects identity picture it's

247
00:09:58,760 --> 00:10:00,470
pretty amazing it's a pirate ship

248
00:10:00,470 --> 00:10:02,890
for sure

249
00:10:03,930 --> 00:00:00,000
Oh
