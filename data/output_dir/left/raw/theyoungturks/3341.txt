1
00:00:00,130 --> 00:00:04,630
THE WOMAN IN THE VIRAL PHOTO OF
A BIKER FLIPPING OFF TRUMP'S

2
00:00:04,630 --> 00:00:08,580
MOTORCADE HAS BEEN FIRED OVER
THE IMAGE.

3
00:00:08,580 --> 00:00:13,059
THIS WOMAN IS JULIE BRISTOW MAN,
A 50-YEAR-OLD MOTHER OF TWO.

4
00:00:13,059 --> 00:00:15,940
SHE SAID SHE WAS STUNNED THAT
SOMEONE HAD TAKEN A PICTURE

5
00:00:15,940 --> 00:00:18,400
OF HER GIVING TRUMP THE MIDDLE
FINGER.

6
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:22,010
APPARENTLY HE WAS DRIVING BACK
FROM A GOLF COURSE AND SHE

7
00:00:22,010 --> 00:00:23,279
WAS ALONG THE ROUTE.

8
00:00:23,279 --> 00:00:26,859
SHE SAYS SHE GAVE IN THE MIDDLE
FINGER A FEW TIMES AND THE

9
00:00:26,859 --> 00:00:29,170
PICTURE WAS SNAPPED BY A WHITE
HOUSE PHOTOGRAPHER.

10
00:00:29,170 --> 00:00:30,869
IT HAS SINCE GONE VIRAL.

11
00:00:30,869 --> 00:00:34,480
AS THE PHOTO CIRCULATED ONLINE
SHE DECIDED TO TELL HER

12
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:40,390
COMPANY WHAT HAPPENED.

13
00:00:40,390 --> 00:00:43,670
WHEN SHE WENT TO WORK ON MONDAY
– BY TUESDAY HER BOSS IS CALLED

14
00:00:43,670 --> 00:00:48,650
INTO A MEETING AND HAD VIOLATED
THE COMPANY POLICY BY

15
00:00:48,650 --> 00:01:02,070
MAKING THE PICTURE OR PROFILE
PICTURE.

16
00:01:02,070 --> 00:01:05,850
SHE WANTED TO GIVE HER COMPANY A
HEADS UP, THEN ON TUESDAY

17
00:01:05,850 --> 00:01:07,869
THEY FIRED HER OVER THIS PHOTO.

18
00:01:07,869 --> 00:01:21,399
THE COMPANY SAID THE 

19
00:01:21,399 --> 00:01:23,420
PHOTO COULD
HURT THEIR BUSINESS BECAUSE

20
00:01:23,420 --> 00:01:27,179
THEY ARE A GOVERNMENT
CONTRACTOR.

21
00:01:27,179 --> 00:01:40,740
THAT LOGIC DIDN'T SEEM TO HOLD
TRUE IN OTHER CASES.

22
00:01:40,740 --> 00:01:53,069
IT SEEMS LIKE THEY ARE MAY BE A
LITTLE BIT OF A POLITICAL

23
00:01:53,069 --> 00:01:55,829
BIAS THERE.

24
00:01:55,829 --> 00:01:59,090
IT SEEMS ABSURD THAT HE WOULD
KEEP HIS JOB FOR SAYING THAT BUT

25
00:01:59,090 --> 00:02:03,360
THEN FLIPPING OFF TRUMP'S
MOTORCADE, THAT SEEMED MORE

26
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:14,440
OBSCENE AND RUDE THAN USING THAT
SORT OF LANGUAGE ONLINE.

27
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:17,950
IT SEEMS SORT OF ANTITHETICAL TO
A LOT OF THE RHETORIC YOU HERE.

28
00:02:17,950 --> 00:02:23,830
THEY ARE ALL AGAINST THIS PC
CULTURE, AND THEN SOMEBODY FLIPS

29
00:02:23,830 --> 00:02:26,220
SOMEBODY OFTEN THEY ARE
FIRED OVER THAT?

30
00:02:26,220 --> 00:02:30,310
IT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE.

31
00:02:30,310 --> 00:02:36,310
>> THAT IS KIND OF THE DANGER OF
SOCIAL MEDIA.

32
00:02:36,310 --> 00:02:39,830
THERE'S A LOT OF PERKS, BUT ON
THE DOWNSIDE IF YOU DO

33
00:02:39,830 --> 00:02:41,640
SOMETHING LIKE THIS WHICH IS
FREEDOM OF SPEECH

34
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:44,940
TECHNICALLY AND THEN YOU USE IT
AS YOUR PROFILE PICTURE AND THEN

35
00:02:44,940 --> 00:02:48,770
PEOPLE IDENTIFY WHERE YOU WORK,
THEY KIND OF GO HAND IN HAND.

36
00:02:48,770 --> 00:02:52,130
I DON'T REALLY AGREE WITH HER
USING IT AS HER FACEBOOK

37
00:02:52,130 --> 00:02:55,660
PHOTO BUT AT THE SAME TIME IT IS
KIND OF CRAZY THAT SHE GOT

38
00:02:55,660 --> 00:02:56,920
FIRED OVER THAT.

39
00:02:56,920 --> 00:02:59,680
>> I THINK IT IS EXACTLY RIGHT.

40
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:01,940
>>YOU REALLY ARE ASKING FOR IT.

41
00:03:01,940 --> 00:03:05,190
YOU ARE LOOKING FOR TROUBLE.

42
00:03:05,190 --> 00:03:08,500
>>AND THEN YOU GO TO HR AND YOU
POINTED OUT TO THEM.

43
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:14,450
YOU MIGHT HAVE ACTUALLY BEEN
ABLE TO GET AWAY WITH IT.

44
00:03:14,450 --> 00:03:16,830
BUT THERE IS NOTHING IN THE
PICTURE THAT NECESSARILY

45
00:03:16,830 --> 00:03:19,520
INDICATED WHO SHE WAS.

46
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:22,460
THERE COULD'VE BEEN ANONYMITY
BUT CLEARLY SHE WASN'T GOOD

47
00:03:22,460 --> 00:03:23,590
WITH THAT.

48
00:03:23,590 --> 00:03:30,260
>>SHE WAS PROUD OF WHAT SHE DID,
BUT THEN TO MAKE IT AS YOUR

49
00:03:30,260 --> 00:03:36,990
SOCIAL IDENTITY – WHAT IF PEOPLE
GO TO THAT BUSINESS AND SAY THIS

50
00:03:36,990 --> 00:03:40,490
EMPLOYEE IS WORKING THERE, AND
THEN IT BECOMES THEIR

51
00:03:40,490 --> 00:03:41,610
BURDEN AND RESPONSIBILITY.

52
00:03:41,610 --> 00:03:45,750
I FEEL LIKE THEY REALLY DIDN'T
HAVE A CHOICE BUT TO DO THAT.

53
00:03:45,750 --> 00:03:50,960
>> THE LAST THING ON THIS, IF
YOU ARE AWARE OF THE CULTURE AT

54
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:54,320
YOUR ORGANIZATION YOU SHOULD BE
AWARE OF THE KINDS OF THINGS

55
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:58,210
THAT YOU CAN POST ON SOCIAL
MEDIA.

56
00:03:58,210 --> 00:04:02,100
BUT HAVING SAID THAT, THERE IS
CLEARLY THE KIND OF

57
00:04:02,100 --> 00:04:04,950
CONTRADICTION THAT HANNAH JUST
OUTLINED.

58
00:04:04,950 --> 00:04:16,798
LIKE I CAN CALL PEOPLE
LIBTARD SAND THAT IS NOT

59
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:18,839
OBSCENE?

60
00:04:18,839 --> 00:04:20,599
>> BUT IF YOU'RE LOOKING AT THE
CULTURE OF THE COMPANY

61
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:27,860
AND SOME YOU CAN GET AWAY WITH
IT.

62
00:04:27,860 --> 00:04:33,730
>> THIS COMPARATIVELY IS NOT THE
SAME SORT OF THING AT ALL.

63
00:04:33,730 --> 00:04:48,539
>> THAN THEY SHOULD HAVE
CONSEQUENCES AS WELL.

64
00:04:48,539 --> 00:04:54,530
>> I FEEL A LITTLE CONFLICTED
AND I DO THINK THAT TO SOME

65
00:04:54,530 --> 00:05:00,150
EXTENT YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO
EXPRESS YOURSELF HOW YOU

66
00:05:00,150 --> 00:05:02,290
PLEASE IN YOUR FREE TIME.

67
00:05:02,290 --> 00:05:06,530
IF YOU ARE ON COMPANY TIME, OR
IN A BUSINESS SITUATION,

68
00:05:06,530 --> 00:05:07,530
THAT IS ANOTHER STORY.

69
00:05:07,530 --> 00:05:12,680
>>THAT'S WHAT SHE SAID, IT WAS
NOT COMPANY TIME.

70
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:14,650
>> SOCIAL MEDIA COMPLICATES IT
BECAUSE PEOPLE CAN SEE

71
00:05:14,650 --> 00:05:17,960
WHERE YOU WORK.

72
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:21,600
>>YEAH, DON'T POST WHERE YOU
WORK.

73
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:26,440
>>BULLETS HAVE SOME FREEDOM OF
EXPRESSION.

74
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:32,950
>> DO YOU FEEL LIKE IN OUR
SOCIETY WE DO KIND OF BASE

75
00:05:32,950 --> 00:05:35,840
THINGS ON OUR OWN
POLITICAL VIEWS?

76
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:38,370
DO YOU THINK THAT LIBERALS DO
THAT AS WELL?

77
00:05:38,370 --> 00:05:40,220
OR DO YOU THINK IT IS JUST
SOMETHING THAT THE RIGHT

78
00:05:40,220 --> 00:05:41,750
DOES MORE?

79
00:05:41,750 --> 00:05:51,380
>> NO, I THINK IF I HAD SEEN
SOMEBODY FLIPPING OFF OBAMA OR

80
00:05:51,380 --> 00:05:54,639
BERNIE SANDERS AND HAVE THEIR
JOB LISTED, I DON'T THINK

81
00:05:54,639 --> 00:05:56,870
THEY SHOULD BE FIRED, OF COURSE
NOT.

82
00:05:56,870 --> 00:06:00,310
WE ARE GOING TO GET TO A STORY
THE NEXT STORY WERE GOING

83
00:06:00,310 --> 00:06:03,630
TO DO IS TALKING ABOUT RAND PAUL
BEING ASSAULTED.

84
00:06:03,630 --> 00:06:05,381
I DON'T AGREE WITH RAND PAUL,
BUT I DON'T BELIEVE YOU

85
00:06:05,381 --> 00:06:07,880
SHOULD BE ASSAULTED.

86
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:10,890
YOU CAN DISAGREE WITH SOMEBODY'S
POLITICAL OPINIONS OR AGREE WITH

87
00:06:10,890 --> 00:06:16,580
THEM, BUT STILL I THINK THERE
ARE CERTAIN COURSES OF ACTION

88
00:06:16,580 --> 00:06:18,840
THAT SHOULD NOT TAKE PLACE
BECAUSE –

89
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:22,220
>>I THINK SHE WAS JUST SORT OF
INVITING –

90
00:06:22,220 --> 00:06:23,220
>>I

91
00:06:23,220 --> 00:06:26,070
THINK WE ALL AGREE THAT MAYBE IT
WASN'T THE SMARTEST THING.

92
00:06:26,070 --> 00:06:30,250
BUT TO YOUR POINT IT IS IRONIC
BECAUSE THE SIDE OF THE

93
00:06:30,250 --> 00:06:33,240
AISLE THAT CALLS OUT SNOWFLAKES
ALL THE TIME FOR POLITICAL

94
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:40,430
CORRECTNESS CAN'T TAKE A LITTLE
FLIP OF THE BIRD IN TRAFFIC.

95
00:06:40,430 --> 00:06:42,800
>>IT WAS CLEARLY JUST
EXPRESSION.

96
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:47,450
>>I THOUGHT IT WAS FUNNY WHEN IT
FIRST BROKE.

97
00:06:47,450 --> 00:06:52,720
>>SHE'S DOING SOMETHING THAT A
LOT OF US FEEL.

98
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:55,650
>> PLUS IT WASN'T A PICTURE OF
HER IN FRONT OF THE WHITE HOUSE

99
00:06:55,650 --> 00:07:00,540
SO SHE WASN'T REALLY IN THE
HEART OF INTENSE CONTROVERSY BUT

100
00:07:00,540 --> 00:07:09,770
AS WE ALL NOW HAVE SAID, HER
TERRITORY WAS NOT SO –

101
00:07:09,770 --> 00:07:14,510
>>I DON'T PUT THE SPECIFICS AS
TO WHAT I DO.

102
00:07:14,510 --> 00:07:20,430
I PUT THE SPECIFIC PLACES I
CONTRIBUTE TO BECAUSE I

103
00:07:20,430 --> 00:07:23,520
DON'T WANT PEOPLE – IT IS JUST
TOO MUCH INFORMATION.

104
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:26,540
IF YOU ARE AN OUTSPOKEN PERSON
AND YOU HAVE SOCIAL MEDIA THERE

105
00:07:26,540 --> 00:07:33,050
ARE THINGS YOU CAN DO TO MAKE
SURE YOU HAVE A SAFE SPACE

106
00:07:33,050 --> 00:07:34,490
FOR YOUR OPINION.

107
00:07:34,490 --> 00:07:37,580
IF YOU DON'T DO THAT, PEOPLE
WILL DISAGREE AND

108
00:07:37,580 --> 00:07:39,950
ULTIMATELY FIRE YOU, LIKE THIS
WOMAN.

109
00:07:39,950 --> 00:07:43,960
I HAVE FRIENDS WHO DON'T REALLY
PUT THEIR GOVERNMENT NAME ON

110
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:46,180
FACEBOOK, THEY HAVE ANOTHER NAME
AND THEY DON'T PUT THEIR

111
00:07:46,180 --> 00:07:54,710
OCCUPATION SO IT IS LIKE THEIR
FREE SPACE – IT IS THEIR FREE

112
00:07:54,710 --> 00:08:00,130
SPACE TO KIND OF SAY WHAT THEY
WANT AND DO WHAT THEY WANT.

113
00:08:00,130 --> 00:08:02,510
IF THAT'S WHAT YOU WANT TO DO,
AND YOU WANT TO HAVE YOUR

114
00:08:02,510 --> 00:08:05,050
PROFILE PICTURE LIKE THAT,
THEN YOU SHOULD HAVE YOUR

115
00:08:05,050 --> 00:08:06,800
OCCUPATION UNDER THERE.

116
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:12,520
>>HOW WOULD THAT HAVE CHANGED
IT?

117
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:16,131
>>MAYBE IT WOULD'VE TAKEN A
LITTLE LONGER FOR THEM TO

118
00:08:16,131 --> 00:08:20,139
IDENTIFY WHO SHE WAS?

119
00:08:20,139 --> 00:08:29,540
>> I FEEL LIKE IF YOU ARE
TAKING A PICTURE OF YOURSELF –

120
00:08:29,540 --> 00:08:30,540
THAT IS ONE THING.

121
00:08:30,540 --> 00:08:33,779
BUT THIS IS THE MOST INNOCUOUS
THING IN THE ENTIRE WORLD.

122
00:08:33,779 --> 00:08:38,070
>> AND YOU CAN'T EVEN TELL WHO
SHE IS, IT'S NOT LIKE SHE'S

123
00:08:38,070 --> 00:08:42,690
WEARING A COMPANY JACKET.

124
00:08:42,690 --> 00:00:00,000
>> TOO ABSURD.
