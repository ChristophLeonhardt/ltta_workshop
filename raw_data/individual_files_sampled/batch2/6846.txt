conservatives have hit a new low on fake news so low that they're just making fake interviews now Alexandria thanks for being here thank you thank you for having me do you have any experience that qualifies you for this job this videos going viral on Facebook with over 1 million views in less than a day and it's about this conservative millennial less racist Tommie replacement doctoring an interview that Alexandria cause zio Cortes did with Margaret Hoover and of course CR T V didn't label it a satire until they got called out and the video has been retweeted by intellectual champions of the right like Ben Shapiro even but I guess it's not shocking when it features gross mischaracterizations like this one what socialism into your own words unprecedented concentration of wealth at the very top tippy top of the 1% Wow I'm I'm kind of surprised to hear you admit that yeah you're right that that's socialism see our TV I guess if you believe that the top 1% will hoard all the wealth under a socialist system as it currently does in ours we might as well get health care and free education while we're at it right now this is great one it's larious because you've seen all the see our TV ads talking about how tired they are of mainstream media lying to you but then there's also the same platform that gave Gavin McGinnis a show Gavin McGinnis who started the openly violent proud boys cult which routinely gives white nationalists like Lauren southern a platform and now they pull off some shit like this and slap on the satire label after they get called out as if the intended audience wasn't fooled by this before the label just look at the comments people are like oh she's such a dummy she's such an idiot no you're the idiot but here's why this is great these goons are absolutely terrified because for the first time in a long time some within the Democratic Party are pushing for economic justice these are ideas that may restore some much-needed balance to our unjust economic system and it has Republicans absolutely shaking like Sean Hannity you're dad's favorite radicalize ur last night a 28 year old socialist from New York defeated longtime Democratic incumbent in a congressional primary race for views for policy positions are actually downright scary these are the positions that Sean Hannity on ironically used on his platform to talk about is downright scary positions like Medicare for all which has over well mning majority support housing is a human right in a country where more than half a million homeless Americans are on the street right now a lot of them are veterans actually a Federal jobs guarantee nearly half of Americans in favor of this as well gun control assault weapons ban criminal justice reform and private prisons are you for keeping private prisons Sean Hannity is wrong with you solidarity with Puerto Rico 70% of Americans believe that border Rico isn't getting the assistant it needs mobilizing against climate change clean campaign finance more than eighty percent of Americans want money out of politics they want finance reform higher education for all 62 percent of Americans support that women's rights support seniors your entire audience is seniors Sean anody why'd you put this on here if these ideas are scary to you buddy you're about to get mortified when so many fuckin Americans wake up but I'm actually happy I'm happy that Fox News is giving our ideas more of a platform than mainstream media effort would just look at this lady from The Daily Caller who bravely attended Cortes victory speech and lived to tell Fox News about it talk about things that everybody wants especially like if you're a parent they talk about education for your kids health care for your kids these the things that you want absolutely terrifying things that you want how dare they I like the way the system is currently set up where the wealthy keep getting wealthier in my school district is forced to go to four days a week everything is fine I was mostly uncomfortable because I was surrounded by a group of people who were talking about how they had gotten involved because they were tired of being angry all the time then it seems like so much effort to be angry about everything instead of to focus on what you could do to change it yeah this is a wake up call America we're all angry it doesn't matter what your background is doesn't matter what you thought your political opinion was for the longest time we are the only people fighting for your rights and both the Liberals in mainstream media and the elitists at Fox News know this if you're tired of being angry all the time you should just try giving economic justice on top of social justice a try
