At the height of the 2016 election researchers
released a report warning about a strange
propaganda technique.
Another day, another lie, another conspiracy
theory, another falsehood.
They called it the "firehose of falsehood."
When a propagandist bombards people with more
lies than they can possibly keep up.
Why all these lies?
Why is it lie after lie after lie?
According to the report, these lies don't
have to be believable.
It wasn't just a lie.
It was such a bad obvious lie.
Researchers found that even obvious lies had
the potential to be highly effective at shaping
public opinion.
I mean he just says things and then they are
the truth in the world of the Donald.
The thing is, that report wasn't about Trump.
It didn't even mention him.
It was about Russian propaganda.
And it raised an interesting question: How
could a powerful leader benefit from telling
obvious lies?
We've signed more bills than any president
ever.
The president just simply lies for no reason.
I was against the war in Iraq.
Why lie about something that you don't have
to lie about?
You have people registered in two states.
They vote twice.
Why does he keep repeating it if it's obviously
not true?
We're going to get to Trump in a minute.
Hell yeah!
But before that, we have to talk to Christopher
Paul.
I'm a senior social scientist at the RAND
Corporation.
He co-wrote the report on Russian firehosing
and he described it as having four key characteristics.
Russian propaganda is high volume and multichannel.
It's rapid, continuous, and repetitive.
It makes no commitment to objective reality.
And it makes no commitment to consistency.
Oooh, sounds like Trump.
Can you give me a second?
I'm building a narrative here.
The first two characteristics are pretty standard
for propaganda.
Research shows that if we hear a lie from
multiple sources, we think of it as more credible.
The same is true for lies we hear repeatedly.
The more familiar we are with a lie, the more
likely we are to think of it as true.
But the last two characteristics — no commitment
to objective reality or consistency — that's
surprising.
They don't care that much about the truth.
Much of their propaganda is either completely
false or has a kernel of truth.
Maybe the most jarring example this was in
2014, when the world watched as Russian troops
entered Ukraine.
There were a bunch of Russian soldiers wearing
uniforms without insignia and those were dubbed
“little green men.”
This was a huge deal.
Russia was essentially invading a country
they had said they were not going to invade.
But when Putin was asked about it:
Were these Russian soldiers?
No.
These were local self-defense forces.
Putin vehemently denied.
“No no, the little green men are not Russian
soldiers.”
It wasn't just that Putin was lying.
He was lying about something so obvious.
There was footage of the soldiers airing on
TV.
Russian troops spreading out throughout the
strategic Crimean Peninsula.
And then, a few weeks later, he just said
the opposite.
Of course, we had our servicemen.
They were acting very correctly.
No “I'm sorry.”
No “I misspoke.”
Just, “Of course we have troops there.”
This is counterintuitive.
This is not what I expected.
I come from an influence background that says
credibility is king and the truth will always
win.
Part of being a good liar is not getting caught.
Making sure your lies are at least somewhat
believable.
When Dick Cheney said, "There is no doubt
Saddam Hussein now has weapons of mass destruction,"
he was lying, but to most people who aren't
intelligence experts, it sounded credible.
If someone asks, "Hey did you eat my sandwich?"
You'd say, "Nope.
I brought my lunch from home."
You wouldn't say, "You never had a sandwich."
But when it comes the firehosing, believability
doesn't really matter.
I think being willing to not be seen as credible
is okay with the Russians.
We'll come back to this.
But right now it's
TRUMP TIME!
Trump time.
Since the election, people have pointed out
that Trump uses firehosing too.
I really had no view that this would be anything
that anyone would think about applying to
American politics.
That's not what I'm about.
I am concerned with foreign intervention in
our political processes.
Okay, fine.
Donovan, bring in the second interview please.
Thank you.
I think it can be deceptive just how different
they look.
But despite the different styles, I think
they do the exact same thing.
This is Masha Gessen.
She's a Russian-American journalist, activist,
and all around badass.
And she's been warning about the similarities
between Trump and Putin for years.
They just create sort of this unmanageable
volume of falsehood.
Gessen argues that firehosing — telling
and retelling obvious lies — isn't about
persuasion.
It's about power.
When Putin says there are no troops in Crimea
or when Trump says he never mocked a disabled
reporter, they're not just lying.
They're asserting that they are not constrained
by reality.
That everything, even things that are totally
obvious to us, can be challenged.
That's a very clear demonstration of power.
You have to engage with what he said even
though it's false.
Those last two features a firehosing — the
shamelessness, the inconsistency — they're
kind of the point.
The way that they lie that makes the obviousness
of the lie part of the powerplay.
Yes, I know that you know what I'm saying
is absurd, and I assert my right to say whatever
I want whenever I want to.
He keeps urinating on the sidewalk and we
have to keep wiping it up.
Not the sidewalk, the living room rug.
Yeah.
On the rug!
What are you cheering for right now?
Our knee-jerk reaction to lies like this is
to fact-check them.
Fact checkers are having a field day with
this one.
President Obama did not found ISIS.
He was not wiretapped, there was no warrant
out.
It is not the biggest tax cut in US history
as the fact-checkers have noted.
But if the goal of firehosing is to assert
power, fact-checking misses the point.
There is nothing quite so humiliating and
disempowering as trying to prove the truth.
Think of a schoolyard bully who says, "Why
are you hitting yourself?
Why are you hitting yourself?"
Degrading you by forcing you to argue with
the obvious.
"Why are you hitting yourself?
Why are you hitting yourself?"
Yeah, you'd know about being bullied.
I sure would.
Thank you.
And I think that's kind of what it feels like
when we fact-check Trump.
It's sullying.
You feel like you've engaged with something
that actually shouldn't be a part of the public
sphere.
Firehosing turns even the most obvious of
facts into a messy, mind-numbing political
fight.
Every time he gets fact-checked Trump lashes
out.
They just don't want to report the truth.
Sarah Sanders blames the media.
If anything has been inflamed it's the dishonesty
that often takes place by the news media.
And something that should not have even been
up for debate starts to look like just another
screaming match where no one really seems
credible.
Donald Trump lies and he lies compulsively.
So this very simple human assumption that
you can know what's true, that assumption
is taken away from you.
You have to work for the truth and the hope
is that, yeah, you'll get exhausted and you'll
eventually give up.
I'm getting depressed.
I know, buddy.
I'm almost done.
We're all almost done.
The ultimate goal of firehosing isn't to pass
lies off as truth.
It's to rob concepts like facts and reality
of their power.
You stand by that claim about him?
I don't stand by anything.
I have my own opinions, you can have your
own opinions.
To reduce truth to just a position.
Isn't it important just to, like, have factual
debates when discussing these things?
Well, as you just commented, there's lots
of different ways of looking at it.
You're saying it's a falsehood and they're
giving alternative facts.
It's somebody's version of the truth, not
the truth.
Truth is truth.
I don't mean to go like...
No it isn't truth.
Truth isn't truth.
And if that sounds a little abstract, just
listen to what Putin said during his press
conference with Trump in July.
As to who is to be believed, you can trust
no one.
He defends the interests of the United States
of America.
And I do defend the interests of the Russian Federation.
So Putin just basically wanted to establish
as a baseline that no one can be trusted.
Everybody's pursuing their own strategic interests
and there's no such thing as the truth.
And a few days later Trump took that argument
a step further.
And just remember, what you're seeing and
what you're reading is not what's happening.
Just stick with us.
Don't believe the crap you see from these
people, the fake news.
Just stick with us.
Essentially, reality is about picking sides.
They're basically saying there's no war between
people who know the truth and people who are
lying.
There's only positional warfare.
Whoever has a better position.
Whoever has objectively more power owns reality.
And it's remarkable how effective that is.
Maybe you can just start acting like you have
total power and it will not exactly give you
total power but it will give you a hell of
a lot more power than an American president
should have.
You never had a sandwich.
You never had a...
Come on man, you're killing me.
Don't look at him if you don't have to.
You never had... we have to unmic him.
All right.
You're off the set.
