okay is this funny did I miss the part where SNL turned into literally just a fundraiser for Democrats it's really really awful remember this on Saturday Night Live is a show that used to be funny at some point and now we've got a bunch of women who can't sing it first of all if you can't sing don't sing okay I'm a good violinist and I don't make my violin playing the centerpiece of what I do because I'm not at the level of Hilary Hahn right these women cannot sing at all and yet SNL features them every week singing and I guess that the me to movement means that they also get to sing badly but they get to see more often because I guess the day they're there social justice warrior ring Jessica Chastain by the way is it unbelievably wealthy right judge Jessica Chastain made at least a couple of million dollars for the Martian and people are complaining Oh Matt Damon made 18 million dollars for the Martian and Jessica Chastain only made a couple of million bucks for the Martian right she's in it for like ten minutes it was just a contestant even in the Martian I got I'm gonna remember her being in it right the entire movie is Matt Damon on Mars that's the entire film of course he made more money also Matt Damon happens to be something called a box office draw and nobody goes to see a Jessica Chastain movie no one I like Jessica Chastain is an actress I think she's good but the idea that people went to see zero dark thirty because they were desperate to see Jessica Chastain in a film what is Molly's game earned I want to look at the earnings from Molly's game okay Molly's game is now out so what's it let's look at the let's look at the box office let's see if we can get some box office stat for that massive hit right is now earned twenty eight point one million dollars miss Sloan right which she also said which she also starred in last year earn a whopping in nine point 1 million dollars at the box office ok the last time the judge I'm gonna look up Jessica Chastain's I am IMDB because whenever people complain about the wage gap in Hollywood it makes no sense whatsoever all of her films that have been successful we're successful because everyone else right because everyone else in the film is a box-office draw now that should be totally Frank about this here are the films that she started where she was the leading lady okay woman walks ahead never even heard of it zookeeper his wife her nothing miss Sloan a total box-office bomb crimson peak mmm the Martian Matt Damon star made lots of money a most violent year very small film and the Oscar it's a her and Oscar Isaac she's very good in it again very small film interstellar she's not the star of it Matthew McConaughey's the star of it and it's Christopher Nolan film so I made lots of money the disappearance of Eleanor Rigby made no money Salome mama she's mama and Annabelle okay but but it's but that is not actually or no she's Annabelle in the movie mama which I've never even heard of zeros aren't 30 like these are not big box office draws none of them zero of these things are big box office drugs but we're supposed to worry about her wage gap with Matt Damon okay like I'm gonna read you Matt Damon's IMDB okay okay Matt Damon's IMDB heard of the films that Matt Damon has starred in over the last few years okay he was the producer on Jason Bourne which made a bajillion dollars okay he was also let's see what did he what he acted oh so he was he was in Thor Ragnarok where he was uncredited he's in the great wall which made a bajillion dollars in China Jason Bourne made a bajillion dollars the Martian a bajillion dollars interstellar bajillion dollars i Elysium which is a big-budget but it busted you know the guy's actually a box-office run then people are like oh well why is she earning what's the Matt Damon okay what women are marching for if you're marching for we want to be treated equally then I'm gonna treat you equal you suck at singing don't sing ever again on national TV okay let's just start with that and also if you're gonna stand for equality I'd like half of Jessica Chastain's paycheck for every movie that she makes because my goodness all these women on SNL I mean for the quality and by the way everyone on SNL should donate their salary to charity given the fact they suck so much lately just awful
