let's be honest Megan Markel does not deserve to become a member of the royal family and I for one will not be celebrating the royal wedding this is a tough one for me I am a staunch royalist I love the royal family I love the institution of the royal family but I just can't bring myself to celebrate the royal wedding I don't think Megan Markel is suitable for royalty I don't think she is so I won't be celebrating the royal wedding well we call it a royal wedding Harry's not exactly a royal is he it seems like this royal wedding is not like any other royal wedding we've ever had there's a lot of reasons why I don't think marquel is ready or suitable even for royalty but the first thing I want to note is that her mental sort of politics her lefty American politics where I say in American that's not fair we've got them in England as well but her lefty politics are even infiltrating the wedding there's a story here the daily edge whatever that is and it says there's a very interesting feminist detail on Prince Harry and Megan markle's wedding invitations and basically just to sum up the article which I've read so you don't have to the article is talking about how usually the invitation will say miss Marcal and mr. so it says miss and mr. but actually on this it says ms/ms and mr. and the they're talking about the fact that oh well if you're a girl you grow up ms miss become MS or become mrs. and it's not fair when you get married your title changes blue it's fair it's feminist it's on unfair blah blah but the articles talking about how it always a great modern step forward that she's using ms instead of miss and I can't help but thinking am I the only one when you were a kid you were a taught that as a young girl you're a Miss as you get older you usually married you become mrs. but if you're divorced or not married and old then your MS that's what I was taught as a kid isn't that what everyone else does let's face it Megan Markel is getting on a bit I mean she's only late 30s but you know it's she's older than Harry and she's a divorcee hence the is right and here's another thing I find it funny that I keep agreeing with arch feminist Germaine Greer recently I agree with her on the whole trans issue and she's also come out saying that she thinks Megan Michaels gonna leave Harry let's watch this video I think it's she's she will see vistas of boredom that are unbelievable but I think the pressure to escape from the firm is crushing so what do you think the prospects are third Prince Harry and Megan Merkel I think she'll bolt she bolted before she was out the door I think she'll bolt I hope in a way that she'll Bowl but maybe she'll take Harry with her she thinks she'll bolt I think she probably will it seems to me that Michaels just a bit of a Fame hungry kind of person you know out quite annoying at attention seeking sort of vain person and her own friends have said it so it says in the article in the Express here Megan Marco became so addicted to fame that when she finally hit the big time as an actress on suits she divorced her first husband and sent in the wedding ring back in the post according to a bombshell report her former best pals since childhood Nanaki pretty said when Megan gained stardom as an actress on TV show suits it completely changed her and she drifted away from her first husband Trevor engleson 41 and her own brother warned Prince Harry against marrying her the article in here is says why was Megan's brother against the Royal Wedding the 51 year old from Oregon claimed Megan had abandoned her father despite him pouring money into her career when she first started out he wrote what kind of person starts out by using her own father until he's bankrupt then forgets about him in Mexico leaving him broke over mostly all her debts and when it's time to pay him back she forgets her own father like she never knew him so there's a lot of reports I mean it's it seems like too much of a coincidence there's so much out there saying how she changed after she became famous and I think she just doesn't seem like a particularly nice person but my real issue with her my real issue is that she's political now if you know British politics the the British using the foundation of British society the royal family are above politics the monarch is above politics the royal family is not to meddle in political issues and yet she's one of the most political people I've ever seen no he can't blame her for being political when she didn't know she was going to become a member of the royal family but the question is is someone with such a a real political past suitable for the royal family or even deserving of the royal family I mean listen to her on this video banging about on about feminism and how Trump's a misogynist yes of course Trump is device and think about just female voters alone right I mean like I think it was in 2012 like the Republican Party lost the female vote by 12 points that's a huge number and with this misogynistic as Trump is and so vocal about it that's a huge chunk of it you're not just voting for a woman if it's Hillary just because she's a woman but certainly because Trump has made it easy to see that you don't really want that kind of world so the newest member of the royal family is a trumpeting of feminist mental case I mean how can we have someone in the royal family who's meant to be non-political when we know exactly where she stands and here's the thing she hasn't just given up the politics to become a member of the royal family she's carried on with it there's an article here from The Telegraph where she said she said that Prince Harry is a feminist here's the article Meghan Marco has proclaimed her thoroughly modern man a proud feminist as the pair embarked on their first official visit to Wales undertaking a long walk about to greet admirers who waited for hours in the cold for them miss Marcal was complimented by Jessica Phillips 23 for her outspoken views on equality miss Phillips said she was so lovely I said it was really lovely to have a feminist in the royal family gesturing to her fiance the former actress told her he's a feminist - who the hell does she think she is who does she think she what connection does she have to our royal family every British person most British people understand the deep connection the deep love we have for that family she's got no connection to it at all apart from the fact that she's shagging Harry who's not even a royal and she comes in oh he's a feminist as well bringing the whole family into disrepute who does she think she is the Queen and Prince Philip have set a standard I love that woman I love that man I I'm terrified of the day they die and I'm terrified of what the royal family is becoming wills and Kate I don't mind I quite like Kate actually I thought she's coming to this family and done a very very good job but let's be honest Meghan Markell will never be worthy of being royalty her husband is not royalty and this whole wedding is a shambles and I think Britain should be ashamed of it if you want to see more from
