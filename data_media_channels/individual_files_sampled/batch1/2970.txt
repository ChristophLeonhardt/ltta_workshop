getting a top-secret clearance for better or worse isn't as difficult as you might think you fill out a form gives all kinds of background data information about where you've traveled around the world and then a federal agent will go and interview your friends and family members and find out a little bit more about you they'll ask about where you've traveled to are you a drug user they'll ask your friends and family would you trust this person with classified information and then it goes through a review and if you don't have any red flags you'll get a top secret clearance now a top secret clearance you have to remember it's not like you get a TS and all of a sudden they read you into you know the Roswell landing you'll only be read into the program so that you need to know something about so there is a such thing as need to know what's also interesting about that is it's not necessarily applied in this day and age if you look at all these staffers and Congress and the White House the National Security Council's ballooned up to like hundreds of people at this point and they're all being read on to covert operations and you have to ask yourself why what for and then it can't be any surprise that this stuff starts leaking out to the press when so many of these bureaucrats know about it
