there is no correlation between trade deficit with a particular country and that country doing better than we are that's just not the way any of this works but the Trump administration is not doing this for economic reasons they're doing it for cultural reasons so here let me explain why they're doing this for cultural reasons again there's a picture okay yeah politics is about pictures policy is about stories politics is about narratives when I say trade deficit doesn't matter it's true but Trump is telling a different story and the story the President Trump is telling is a story that goes something like this once upon a time there are booming industries in the United States large-scale factories these big buildings located in Detroit where people worked on employment lines where they worked on on manufacturing lines and they worked there for 50 years and they got the gold watch and then they went home and they had enough money based on that one salary to support their families why can't we go back to something like that and the answer is because America's economy is much more developed you have better stuff now you have cheaper stuff now the businesses that we work in are better to work in than those businesses if you had a choice between working in a Pittsburgh smelter and working in the Pittsburgh healthcare industry you would choose to work in the Pittsburgh healthcare industry Pittsburgh by the way is doing quite well right the Pittsburgh unemployment statistic right now the Pittsburgh unemployment rate currently is 4.6 percent as of September 2017 okay that is lower than Pennsylvania as a whole it's lower than Philadelphia at 6.0 percent that's because Pittsburgh has totally shifted how it works Pittsburgh has become one of more beautiful cities in the Union Pittsburgh is is is clean now it is a service industry it is a health care industry driven city but Trump doesn't like that he wants to go back to the pictures from the Deerhunter where you got we've got Christopher Walken working in giant gloves right he wants to go back to the pictures from Breaking Away where you've got the the father working in in in a quarry and that's what Trump thinks industry looks like it's just ridiculous it's just ridiculous Iran by the way has a trade surplus Iran is number 15 in the world and trade surplus is their economy something that you'd like is that something that you think makes any sense here are the countries with the largest trade deficit by contrast the three largest cut three largest trade deficits in the world United States UK Canada those economies sound pretty good to you because they are pretty good right India is a growing economy they have a trade deficit France has a pretty a pretty significant trade deficit Australia has a significant trade deficit again no correlation between having a trade deficit and and having a poor economy but again it's not about that it's about Trump thinking he's gonna win politically because he promised a bunch of people in manufacturing industries he's gonna bring their jobs back I said at the time that's a lie those jobs aren't coming back those jobs left because of technology they did not leave because of global competition and they certainly are not going to be protected by killing jobs in other industries because all the surplus is I mean all it all tariffs is is a tax that is being placed on everyone else for the benefit of some so if you think that for example the ethanol industry the ethanol industry needs to be subsidized by the federal government I don't think so I think that it's nasty to protects me to pay off a bunch of farmers in Iowa I don't see why that's useful
