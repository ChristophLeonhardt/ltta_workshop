ALMOST EVERY SITUATION. Neil: THANKS, RICH. SPEAKING OF CHUCK SCHUMER. REMEMBER WHEN THE IRANIAN DEAL WAS CRAFTED BY BARACK OBAMA? THIS WAS CHUCK SCHUMER. WE SHOULD NOT GO FORWARD WITH THIS AGREEMENT. THIS EVIL REGIME HAS STAYED IN POWER WITHOUT A SLIGHT THREAT TO THEIR BEING OVERTHROWN. THE ODDS ARE TOO HIGH, TOO HIGH THAT IT WILL STAY FLAWED. Neil: THIS DANGEROUS AGREEMENT, THE EVIL AGREEMENT. YOU'D THINK WHEN THIS PRESIDENT WALKED AWAY FROM IT, CHUCK SCHUMER WOULD WELCOME IN. OF COURSE. TAKE A LOOK. THERE'S NO REPORTS THAT IRAN HAS VIOLATED THE AGREEMENT. Neil: ENTER ABBOTT AND COSTELLO. BUT BACK IN 2015 I DON'T KNOW. INCONSISTENCY. FORMER CIA ANALYST, BUCK SEXTON. BUCK, COME ON. HE WAS AMONG FOUR SENATORS THAT WAS AGAINST THIS FOR VALID REASONS AT THE TIME. THE HOUSE TOOK IT UP AS A RESOLUTION. DIDN'T GO ANYWHERE. YOU CAN'T HAVE IT BOTH WAYS, CAN YOU? IF YOU'RE CHUCK SCHUMER YOU THINK YOU CAN. LOOK, THE IRAN DEAL WITHDRAWAL BY PRESIDENT TRUMP IS A PROMISE KEPT. I THINK THAT FOR PEOPLE THAT CARE ABOUT CONSTITUTIONALISM, SEPARATION OF POWERS, WE SHOULDN'T HAVE A PRECEDENT THAT PRESIDENTS CAN USE THEIR DISCRETION TO BIND DEALS THAT DON'T GO THROUGH THE SENATE. THAT'S ANOTHER ADDED BENEFIT OF THIS. ON TOP OF THE FACT THAT IT WAS A BAD DEAL. DIDN'T DEAL WITH SOME ISSUES THAT WERE CLEARLY CENTRAL TO WHAT WE WANT WITH IRAN, WHICH IS DEFANG WHAT WILL BE A NUCLEAR STATE AT SOME POINT IN THE FUTURE. NORTH KOREA, BY THE WAY, SAYING THIS IS NO BIG DEAL, KIM JONG-UN COULD VERY WELL HAVE HELD ON TO THOSE HOSTAGES TO GIVE HIM ADDITIONAL LEVERAGE GOING INTO THIS SUMMIT. I THINK THAT IF HE HAD NO PLANS TO EVEN HEAR TRUMP OUT, THAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN THE WAY FORWARD FOR HIM. AT A MINIMUM, IT'S A CONFIDENCE BUILDING MEASURE AND OBVIOUSLY GREAT NEWS FOR THE AMERICAN PEOPLE AND THE FAMILIES THAT GET BACK THEIR FAMILY MEMBERS. I'D LIKE TO SEE MORE CHEERFULNESS FROM DEMOCRATS ON THAT FOR OBVIOUS REASONS. Neil: YOU KNOW, FOR OBVIOUS REASONS, I HAVE TO ASK YOU A LITTLE BIT ABOUT WHAT'S GOING ON. THE OIL MARKET RESPONSE TO THIS. SEEMS A LITTLE ARCANE HERE. BUT OIL IS RUNNING UP. STILL AT MULTIYEAR HIGHS. THE FEELING SEEMS TO BE THAT WE COULD SEE OIL TAKEN OFF THE MARKET. THE IRANIANS COULD BE IN A WORLD OF HURT HERE. SANCTIONS. YOU KNOW THE DRILL. IF THE WORLD FINANCIAL MARKETS, OUR OWN INCLUDED WERE CONCERNED ABOUT IT, THEY HAD A FUNNY WAY OF SHOWING IT. WHO IS RIGHT HERE? A LOT OF THAT IS PRICED INTO THIS, NEIL. PEOPLE WERE EXPECTING THAT TRUMP FOR QUITE A WHILE WAS GOING TO PULL OUT OF THIS DEAL. WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE CAPACITY OF THE U.S. BECAUSE OF SHALE AND ALSO JUST THE EXCESS CAPACITY ON THE MARKET AROUND THE WORLD RIGHT NOW, I'M NOT SURE THAT ANYONE WOULD EXPECT TO BE A MAJOR OIL SHOCK FROM IRAN HAVING ITS CAPACITY TAKEN OFF OF THE MARKET. CERTAINLY FROM A GLOBAL FINANCIAL PERSPECTIVE, TRUMP HAS DONE SO MUCH THAT I THINK HAS GIVEN THE MARKET THE SENSE OF STABILITY THAT WE'RE NOT GOING TO SEE SHOCKS FROM THINGS LIKE THE IRAN DEAL. WE WON'T SEE PEOPLE ALL OF A SUDDEN GET SPOOKED. A LOT OF THE CONVENTIONAL WISDOM, THE PEOPLE USING GEO POLITICS OR THAT USE GEO POLITICS FOR A BAROMETER FOR WHERE THE MARKET IS GOING HAVE BEEN PROVEN WRONG TIME AND TIME AGAIN. SO THAT FACTORS INTO THE THINKING. Neil: SO RIGHT ABOUT THAT. WHAT IF WE'RE THE ONLY ONES THAT DO THIS? IN OTHER WORDS, THE FIVE COUNTRIES THAT SIGNED ON, ENGLAND, FRANCE, GERMANY, CHINA, THEY DON'T SIGN ON TO WHAT WE'RE DOING AND WE'RE DOING THIS ALONE, THEN WHAT? I THINK WE HAVE MORE LEVERAGE WITH OUR ALLIES. PERHAPS THAT'S NOT THE RIGHT WORDS. WE HAVE BETTER WAYS OF ESTABLISHING WITH THEM A MEANS OF GETTING A NEW DEALS. KEEP IN MIND, THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION IS NOT SAYING WE JUST WANT SANCTIONS WITH IRAN. WE HAVE NOTHING ELSE PLANNED. THEY WANT A RENEGOTIATION OF THE DEAL. PRESIDENT RUN THE RAN AS A NEGOTIATOR. HE'S GOING TO ALLIES WHERE POMPEO AND THE REST OF THE TEAM AND SAY LOOK, WE HAVE THE UPPER HAND HERE IN DEALING WITH THE IRANIANS. THEY CAN HAVE A NUCLEAR WEAPONS PROGRAM. THEY CANNOT HAVE BOTH. WE, MEANING US AND OUR ALLIES, SHOULD BE WORKING TOWARDS THAT END. THAT INCLUDES BALLISTIC MISSILES AS PART OF THIS. THAT INCLUDES INSPECTIONS OF MILITARY SITES THAT THE IRANIANS HAVE THAT WERE EXCLUDED AND NO SUN SET PROVISIONS. THAT WAS THE FATAL FLAW FROM THE BEGINNING THAT EVERYBODY SAID AND SAID UNLESS YOU GET A RADICALLY DIFFERENT REVISION, THE RADICALS WILL BE IN CHARGE. HOW COULD THIS WORK?
