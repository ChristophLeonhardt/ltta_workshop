just before we turn the camera on you mentioned that the university has made a public statement even today I haven't seen that yet if it's a public statement obviously we can talk about it can you tell me what news Wilfred Laurier has for us today on this endless manner yeah well actually it's some good news the president has issued a statement and she's giving some of the findings from the independent investigation that took place and I've made the list one of the things she said was the meeting that Lindsay was subjected to never should have happened another thing that she says is it's clear that there was no formal complaint now that already was leaked out in the press but she acknowledges that but she also says that there was misapplication of university policy and and that's interesting to me because that is a positive sign that they might try to actually take a or put a rein on some of the crazy diversity and equity stuff that's been coming out of the diversity and equity office also here's the big one they finally have it in print that Lindsay did no wrong by showing a video from public television that that that hasn't been admitted yet but now it has and that was part of what we were seeing from the president today yeah well I can only imagine how much pressure she's in I mean I'd like to say that I would be a free speech absolutist especially when you're the president of university I mean if not there then we're easy for me to say I don't have thousands of trigger warnings safeSpace loving toxic you know positionality problematize errs running around hounding me I'm guessing in this one the alumni donors called the shot and and maybe some very old school professors who believe in freedom but you're right the statement you've just read is a little bit of positive news I know you've been one of Lindsey Sheppard's champions on campus I haven't spoken with her I mean I've had some e-mails back and forth with her a few weeks ago but I'm not in touch with her I get the sense that she doesn't want to hang around there why would she talk about toxic environment I think that I think she should if she's going to pursue her studies I she should go somewhere else that doesn't need a month to figure out that Orwell was a warning not a prescription well she's a really tough cookie and I would say that she just might stay if for no other reason then to try and make changes for the better and and she's a woman of integrity and the more I get to know her the more I can say that everything that you see from her in the from the first recording all the way to any other interview she's done she is as full of integrity as as she appears that's an excerpt from my daily TV show the Ezra Levant show normally it's behind a paywall but I thought you'd like this video so we put it on YouTube if you want to subscribe to watch the daily show every day including always two interviews today and I read my hate mail just click on this screen and become a Premium Member you
