your mattress should be cleaned in the following method you want to remove everything you've got your sheets you've got your mattress protector hopefully I hope you have a mattress protector on there it's a very important thing to have and then you can just air it out for a little bit you might want to open your windows to your mattress might be a little stinky it's fine we've all been there and you can take baking soda and sprinkle baking soda what I like to do is have a sifter and pour baking soda into the sifter and then just tap the side of the sifter and let it sort of spread evenly over the top of the mattress let it fit like that you can even leave it for an hour baking sort of pretty innocuous in the sense that it won't harm anything it will only help your situation it will only help remove odors and then you can use a vacuum with brush attachment you want the vacuum attachment to be very clean by the way it's going on your mattress and some companies even have their own special vacuum attachments just for mattresses so you can investigate that as well and then you want to vacuum very thoroughly the top to remove all that baking soda and once that's done you can air it out a little bit longer and then put your seat back on
