YOU MAY HAVE SEEN NEWS OF THE
BRIDGE COLLAPSE AT FLORIDA
INTERNATIONAL UNIVERSITY.
THEY
WERE BUILDING A BRIDGE.
IT WAS
950 TONS AND THEY CALLED IT AN
INSTANT BRIDGE WHILE THEY WERE
BUILDING IT, IT COLLAPSED ON
TRAFFIC THAT WAS ALLOWED TO PASS
UNDERNEATH IT AT THE TIME.
THERE'S AN ONGOING INVESTIGATION
AS TO WHAT WENT ON.
MARCO RUBIO
TRYING TO CLARIFY THINK THINGS
LIKE THEY WERE SUPPOSED TO
TIGHTEN THE CABLES ON IT AND
THEY ORDERED SOMEONE TO TIGHTEN
IT BUT BEFORE THEY COULD BE
TIGHTENED THIS HAPPENS BUT THERE
IS AN ONGOING INVESTIGATION.
ONE OF THE COMPANIES BEHIND IT
MADE A STATEMENT IN THE WAKE OF
THE EVENT GOT IT IS CALLED FIGG
BRIDGE ENGINEERS.
THEY SAID:
IT 
LOOKS LIKE A PRETTY SOLID
APOLOGY BUT THERE WAS A BIT IN
THE MIDDLE THAT IN OUR 40 YEAR
HISTORY NOTHING LIKE THIS HAS
HAPPENED.
BUT NEWS HAS SURFACED:
AS A RESULT THE FIRM WAS FINED
$20,000.
IT IS JUST WEIRD, IT IS A
FAMILY COMPANY, THAT YOU WOULD
MENTION THAT SOMETHING HAPPENED
AS RECENTLY AS 2012.
ALSO I THOUGHT I READ THAT
THEY PUT IT UP IN SIX HOURS AND
THAT THERE WAS PLANS NOT EVEN TO
HAVE THIS BRIDGE READY UNTIL
NEXT YEAR, SO WHAT IS THE RUSH?
WHAT IS THE PAYOFF?
IT IS A FOOTBRIDGE, GO AROUND.
WHY WOULD THEY RISK PEOPLE'S
LIVES?
IT IS THIS NEW CONSTRUCTION
METHOD CALLED ACCELERATED
BRIDGE CONSTRUCTION.
ON NAME ALONE I VOTE NO.
IT WAS ACTUALLY DEVELOPED IN
PART AT FIU WHICH IS WHY I
THINK THEY SAW THIS AS A
PUBLICITY OPPORTUNITY AND
IT WAS DEVELOPED WITH A COUPLE
OF OTHER UNIVERSITIES BUT
THE WHOLE IDEA IS A GOES UP IN
SIX HOURS AS OPPOSED TO
OBSTRUCTING TRAFFIC FOR
24 OR NOT EVEN,
24 WEEKS OR HOWEVER LONG IT
TAKES TO BUILD A BRIDGE.
HERE WHEN THEY BUILT THE
BRIDGE OVER THE 405
IT SHUT DOWN TRAFFIC FOR LIKE
DAYS, ENTIRE DAYS AT A TIME.
EXACTLY.
I AM NEVER DEFENDING ANYTHING
THEY DO TO ENHANCE THE 405 AND
NOT ANYWAY, BECAUSE THEY DID
THAT, IT DIDN'T COLLAPSE AND
PEOPLE DIDN'T DIE.
THAT LEADS TO
THE MOST IMPORTANT POINT WHICH
IS WE
HAVE TO CONSTANTLY DEFEAT THESE
RIGHT-WING MYTHOLOGIES AND SO
THEY SAY, REGULATION IS ALWAYS
BAD, IT SLOWS EVERYTHING DOWN.
YOU HAVE TO DEREGULATE.
WELL,
IT KIND OF DEPENDS, DOESN'T IT
QUESTO IF THERE IS
OVERREGULATION, WHICH IS
ENTIRELY POSSIBLE, THEN YES, YOU
SHOULD DEREGULATE A LITTLE BIT.
IF WALL STREET KEEPS CRASHING
THE ECONOMY, I WOULD STEP OF THE
REGULATION RATHER THAN STEP IT
DOWN AS AN EXAMPLE SAW IN
BRIDGES, LET'S KEEP THE
REGULATIONS UP BECAUSE IF
BRIDGES FALL THEN PEOPLE DIE AND
IT IS KIND OF A BAD IDEA.
BUILDINGS USED TO COLLAPSE ALL
OF THE TIME BACK IN THE DAY.
WE
DID NOT KNOW HOW TO BUILD THEM
TO BE EARTHQUAKE RESISTANT,
WHEN EARTHQUAKE HITS BUT WE
DID KNOW BUT THERE WERE NO
REGULATIONS ENFORCING IT SO IT
WAS CHEAPER TO BUILD A
BUILDING WITHOUT THOSE REQUIRED
REGULATIONS BUILT-IN.
ROLLERS ETC.
IT DOES COST MORE TO BUILD THE
BUILDING IN LA NOW, BECAUSE WHY?
IN THE MIDDLE OF AN EARTHQUAKE,
YOU WERE SUPER PSYCHED THAT
THEY BUILT IT THAT WAY
BECAUSE WHEN THE 90
TON SLAB OF CONCRETE BALLS ON
YOUR HEAD, A KIND OF HURTS.
IT IS TERRIBLE.
MCM, THE
OTHER COMPANY THAT WAS INVOLVED
IN ACTUAL CONSTRUCTION SAID
THAT, OR WAS REPORTED THAT THEY
ALSO HAD 11 VIOLATION 620 13 AND
HAD BEEN FINED $50,000 OVER THAT
TIME.
THAT WAS REPORTED IN TIME
MAGAZINE THROUGH STATS FROM
OSHA.
ONE LAST WEIRD POINT I WANT
TO MAKE ON THE STORY.
WOLF PAC
IS AN ORGANIZATION TO GET MONEY
OUT OF POLITICS,
WOLF-PAC.COM/GO.
GET MONEY OUT
OF POLITICS.
ANYWAY, I AM SUPER
PROUD OF THE PEOPLE IN AND THERE
A LOT OF VETERANS IN THE GROUP
BECAUSE THEY THINK IT MAKES
SENSE, AND IT IS FIGHTING FOR
FREEDOM IN A DIFFERENT WAY.
THERE ARE A LOT OF TEACHERS IN
THE GROUP BECAUSE THEY FIND THAT
IT HELPS BECAUSE I GET
FRUSTRATED WITH WHAT HAPPENS IN
THE SCHOOL SYSTEM AND THEY WANT
TO KNOW HOW TO FIX IT.
THEY
LOGICALLY FIGURE OUT THAT IT IS
MONEY IN POLITICS BUT THERE ARE
ALSO A LOT OF ENGINEERS AND I
TALKED TO A COUPLE OF ENGINEERS
IN A ROW COUPLE OF YEARS AGO,
REMEMBER HAVING THIS
CONVERSATIONS WITH THE
VOLUNTEERS AND I WAS LIKE WHAT
DREW YOU TO WOLFPAC?
ONE
OF THEM MADE A GREAT COMMENT
THAT I QUOTE FROM TIME TO TIME
ON THE SHOW.
YOU CANNOT HALF
BUILD A BRIDGE.
IF YOU ARE AN
ENGINEER YOU HAVE TO GET THE
BRIDGE HUNDRED PERCENT
RIGHT AND SO THEY THINK WOLFPACK
IS LOGICAL AND IT BRINGS
ALL THE WAY TO A MENU MEANT
THAT ACTUAL SOLVES A PROBLEM
WHICH IS RIGHT NEXT TO THEM TO
SAY THAT I WAS REMINDED OF
THAT READING THE STORY.
YOU CAN'T EVEN 99%
BUILT A BRIDGE.
IF YOU ARE AN ENGINEER YOU
HAVE TO GET A 100% RIGHT.
THAT IS WHY REGULATIONS ARE
IMPORTANT IN CASES LIKE THIS.
