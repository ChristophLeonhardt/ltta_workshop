you're the average of the five people you associate with most that was advice I got when I was a teenager that I think is the best advice I probably ever received financially emotionally physically everything on every level you are the average of the five people you spend the most time with I surround myself with those people now honestly and it's it's not because I'm just choosing my friends to average up I mean I enjoy hanging out with these people as well and I've known a lot of them for many many years but they don't have to be older than me they could be the same age they could be younger but maybe have better developed zen-like capabilities like Matt Mullenweg he was thought of as the lead developer of WordPress which power is more than 25% of the Internet at this point Kevin Rose would be another serial entrepreneur Kevin Kelly who is much older than I am who is I think the the true world's most interesting man then they're people like Maria Popova I've gotten to know her ability to consume high quality information and distill it and then put out beautiful prose it gives me something to aspire to and Tony Robbins the more I get to know him the more impressed I am what you see is what you get Tony on stage is Tony in person those are a few that come to mind right off the bat
