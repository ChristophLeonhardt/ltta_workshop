1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:03,110
SEATTLE HAS A NEW PLAN TO AT
LEAST PARTIALLY DEMOCRATIZE

2
00:00:03,110 --> 00:00:05,660
CAMPAIGN-FINANCE OR AN
EXPERIMENT TO MOVE IN THAT

3
00:00:05,660 --> 00:00:09,150
DIRECTION ANYWAY, AND SOME
CONSERVATIVES ARE NOT HAPPY

4
00:00:09,150 --> 00:00:10,150
ABOUT IT.

5
00:00:10,150 --> 00:00:13,010
THEY HAVE A NEW DEMOCRACY
VOUCHER PROGRAM THAT PROVIDES

6
00:00:13,010 --> 00:00:16,970
EVERY ELIGIBLE SEATTLE RESIDENT
WITH $100 IN TAXPAYER-FUNDED

7
00:00:16,970 --> 00:00:19,819
VOUCHERS TO DONATE TO THE
CANDIDATES OF THEIR CHOICE.

8
00:00:19,819 --> 00:00:22,150
THAT MEANS THAT THEORETICALLY,
REGARDLESS OF WHETHER YOU

9
00:00:22,150 --> 00:00:25,189
ARE ONE OF THE PRIVILEGED YOU
CAN GIVE THOUSANDS UPON

10
00:00:25,189 --> 00:00:27,220
THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS IN EVERY
ELECTION OR YOU ARE A

11
00:00:27,220 --> 00:00:32,029
PERSON WHO EVEN GIVING 10 OR $20
IS DIFFICULT, YOU KNOW WILL HAVE

12
00:00:32,029 --> 00:00:37,000
THE OPPORTUNITY TO EXERCISE YOUR
SPEECH IN THE FORM OF MONEY.

13
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,860
THIS PROGRAM WAS CREATED BY A
VOTER APPROVED BALLOT

14
00:00:39,860 --> 00:00:43,370
MEASURE IN NOVEMBER 2015
AND IS FUNDED BY A 10 YEAR $30

15
00:00:43,370 --> 00:00:45,030
MILLION PROPERTY TAX LEVY.

16
00:00:45,030 --> 00:00:47,289
THAT IS WHERE THE TROUBLE IS
COMING FROM DOCTOR

17
00:00:47,289 --> 00:00:49,210
REGISTERED VOTERS ARE
AUTOMATICALLY SENT TO VOUCHERS.

18
00:00:49,210 --> 00:00:51,449
THOSE WHO ARE NOT REGISTERED AND
THOSE WITHOUT A PERMANENT

19
00:00:51,449 --> 00:00:54,609
ADDRESS EDGES HOMELESS PEOPLE
CAN APPLY IN MELBOURNE

20
00:00:54,609 --> 00:00:56,359
PRESENT THE CITY COMMISSION.

21
00:00:56,359 --> 00:00:59,480
THIS ALSO ENCOURAGES PEOPLE TO
REGISTER BECAUSE THEY WILL

22
00:00:59,480 --> 00:01:02,989
GET ACCESS TO THAT FREE MONEY TO
PRODUCE PAY WITH, BUT IF YOU

23
00:01:02,989 --> 00:01:06,200
AREN'T, YOU STILL CAN'T GET IT
OF COURSE WHICH IS GOOD TO SEE.

24
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:07,850
IT'S ARTIE MAKING A BIG
DIFFERENCE AT LEAST FOR

25
00:01:07,850 --> 00:01:08,850
CERTAIN CANDIDATES.

26
00:01:08,850 --> 00:01:11,040
JOHN GRANT IS A LEFTIST CITY
COUNCIL CANDIDATE.

27
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:14,170
HE HAS MADE THE VOUCHERS A
CENTERPIECE OF HIS CAMPAIGN

28
00:01:14,170 --> 00:01:18,380
AND ACTIVISM IN REGARDS TO THE
HOMELESS SPECIFICALLY.

29
00:01:18,380 --> 00:01:23,250
OF THE $145,933 IN DONATIONS
THAT HE IS RECEIVED, ALMOST

30
00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:26,361
ALL OF IT HAS COME FROM THOSE
VOUCHERS AND SO COURSE HE

31
00:01:26,361 --> 00:01:28,020
IS A BIG PROPONENT OF IT.

32
00:01:28,020 --> 00:01:30,510
HE SAID SPECIFICALLY, I TOOK A
PLEDGE NOT TO ACCEPT ANY

33
00:01:30,510 --> 00:01:32,320
MONEY FROM CORPORATIONS AND
DEVELOPERS.

34
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:34,890
I WANTED TO SHOW THAT DEMOCRACY
VOUCHERS CAN SUPPORT

35
00:01:34,890 --> 00:01:37,170
GRASSROOTS CAMPAIGNS THAT WANT
TO ADDRESS THE STOMACH

36
00:01:37,170 --> 00:01:38,200
ISSUES LIKE HOMELESSNESS.

37
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:40,950
AND IF YOU THINK ABOUT THE WHOLE
CITY HAVING ACCESS TO THESE

38
00:01:40,950 --> 00:01:44,979
VOUCHERS A MEANS THAT CANDIDATES
WHO WANT TO GET ELECTED CITYWIDE

39
00:01:44,979 --> 00:01:48,700
NOW THEY CAN'T JUST GO TO ONE OR
TWO BIG DONORS OR CORPORATIONS.

40
00:01:48,700 --> 00:01:51,680
THEY THEORETICALLY CAN USE THE
SORT OF PATH THAT JOHN

41
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:54,841
KRANTZ OR BERNIE SANDERS HAVE
USED WERE YOU APPEALED TO THE

42
00:01:54,841 --> 00:02:00,090
ACTUAL PEOPLE WHOSE VOICES WILL
BE AMPLIFIED BY THIS EXPERIMENT.

43
00:02:00,090 --> 00:02:02,590
CONSERVATIVE SHOULD CELEBRATE
THIS BECAUSE THEY THINK MONEY A

44
00:02:02,590 --> 00:02:06,509
SPEECH SO WHAT THIS DOES IS IT
ALLOWS MORE PEOPLE TO SPEAK SO

45
00:02:06,509 --> 00:02:10,020
CELEBRATING OUR FREEDOM OF
SPEECH AND THEY TOLD US

46
00:02:10,020 --> 00:02:13,290
THAT NO, IT'S NOT THAT THE COKE
BROTHERS AND SHELDON ADELSON

47
00:02:13,290 --> 00:02:17,640
AND ALL THOSE GUYS WANT TO JUST
LEGALLY BRIBE POLITICIANS.

48
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:21,370
NO, THEY DON'T WANT TO DO THAT,
THEY JUST WANT TO SPEAK

49
00:02:21,370 --> 00:02:24,350
BECAUSE THEY LOVE FREEDOM OF
SPEECH.

50
00:02:24,350 --> 00:02:25,570
SPEAKING.

51
00:02:25,570 --> 00:02:29,030
NOW ALL OF A SUDDEN IN SEATTLE,
YOU HAVE FREEDOM OF SPEECH

52
00:02:29,030 --> 00:02:33,550
BY THEIR DEFINITION, NO, WE
DON'T LIKE IT WHEN YOU SPEAK.

53
00:02:33,550 --> 00:02:35,280
THEY ARE OPPOSED TO THIS
PROGRAM.

54
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:36,420
SO THERE IS A LAWSUIT.

55
00:02:36,420 --> 00:02:39,680
THE LIBERTARIAN LAW FORM PACIFIC
LEGAL FOUNDATION IS REPRESENTING

56
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:42,270
TO SEATTLE HOMEOWNERS IN THE
LAWSUIT AGAINST THE CITY.

57
00:02:42,270 --> 00:02:44,660
THEY ALLEGE THAT DEMOCRACY
VOUCHERS VIOLATE THEIR FIRST

58
00:02:44,660 --> 00:02:47,960
AMENDMENT RIGHTS BECAUSE THE
TAXES ARE FUNDING CANDIDATES A

59
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:50,340
POSTOP FOR THE PARTICULAR PEOPLE
I'M SURE THAT THAT IS A BIG

60
00:02:50,340 --> 00:02:54,450
THING BUT THE PROPERTY TAX BY
ITSELF IS GOING TO ALWAYS HAVE

61
00:02:54,450 --> 00:02:57,900
REPERCUSSIONS, LEGAL
REPERCUSSIONS FROM THOSE

62
00:02:57,900 --> 00:02:58,900
OUT TO PAY IT.

63
00:02:58,900 --> 00:03:00,790
THIS IS BRILLIANT.

64
00:03:00,790 --> 00:03:04,310
THE LAWSUIT SUCKS, BUT THE FACT
THAT PROPERTY TAXES ARE

65
00:03:04,310 --> 00:03:08,450
BEING GIVEN, USES ROUTERS AND
BEING GIVEN TO HOMELESS

66
00:03:08,450 --> 00:03:11,760
PEOPLE TO THEN BE ABLE TO VOTE
FOR THE CANDIDATE THEY WANT

67
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:13,900
IN THEIR CITY IS AMAZING.

68
00:03:13,900 --> 00:03:15,590
I'M FROM SAN FRANCISCO.

69
00:03:15,590 --> 00:03:18,120
WE HAVE A HORRIBLE, WERE
PROBABLY ONE OF THE MOST

70
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:19,780
UNEQUAL CITIES IN THIS COUNTRY.

71
00:03:19,780 --> 00:03:25,840
WE HAVE A TECH BOOM AND A RAGING
HOMELESSNESS PROBLEM AND IT

72
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:29,420
IS NOT GOING AWAY ANYTIME SOON
AND I WOULD LOVE TO SEE SAN

73
00:03:29,420 --> 00:03:30,420
FRANCISCO IMPLEMENT THIS.

74
00:03:30,420 --> 00:03:31,420
YOU WILL SEE CHANGES.

75
00:03:31,420 --> 00:03:35,150
THIS IS DEMOCRACY IN ACTION,
IT'S AMAZING.

76
00:03:35,150 --> 00:03:38,710
PROPERTY TAXES GIVEN TO HOMELESS
PEOPLE TO VOTE WITH THEIR

77
00:03:38,710 --> 00:03:41,470
DOLLARS AND HAVE SPEECH WITH
MONEY IS THE ONLY SPEECH

78
00:03:41,470 --> 00:03:43,090
THAT COUNTS OF COURSE.

79
00:03:43,090 --> 00:03:44,210
YES.

80
00:03:44,210 --> 00:03:49,260
NOW, I LOVE THAT LAWSUIT
BECAUSE OF HOW HILARIOUS IT

81
00:03:49,260 --> 00:03:50,880
IS ON A COUPLE ACCOUNTS.

82
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:55,200
THEY SAY LOOK, BECAUSE OF THE
FIRST AMENDMENT, RICH PEOPLE GET

83
00:03:55,200 --> 00:04:00,060
TO SPEAK IN ELECTIONS BY PUTTING
IN LITERALLY BILLIONS OF DOLLARS

84
00:04:00,060 --> 00:04:02,670
INTO CAMPAIGN CONTRIBUTIONS AND
INDEPENDENT EXPENDITURES.

85
00:04:02,670 --> 00:04:05,820
THE FIRST AMENDMENT ALLOWS RICH
PEOPLE TO SPEAK.

86
00:04:05,820 --> 00:04:10,030
THE FIRST AMENDMENT ALSO SHUT
SUPPORT PEOPLE BECAUSE

87
00:04:10,030 --> 00:04:12,641
ACCORDING TO THIS LAWSUIT, THE
FIRST AMENDMENT, THEIR

88
00:04:12,641 --> 00:04:15,330
FIRST AMENDMENT RIGHTS, THE RICH
AND POVERTY PEOPLE FIRST

89
00:04:15,330 --> 00:04:18,019
AMENDMENT RIGHTS MEANS YOU SHUT
THE HELL UP.

90
00:04:18,019 --> 00:04:20,889
I'M NOT GIVING YOU ANY DEMOCRACY
VOUCHERS, WE'RE NOT DOING

91
00:04:20,889 --> 00:04:22,400
PUBLIC FINANCING.

92
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:24,319
YOU ARE NOT GOING TO GET ANY
VOICE.

93
00:04:24,319 --> 00:04:25,720
I GET ALL THE WAYS YOU GET NONE
OF IT.

94
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:28,030
YOU SEE HOW I BELIEVE IN THE
FIRST AMENDMENT.

95
00:04:28,030 --> 00:04:31,620
IT'S AMAZING HOW THAT WORKS.

96
00:04:31,620 --> 00:04:34,439
NOW ARE THEY GOING TO WIN
BECAUSE HE MAY GET SEDUCED INTO

97
00:04:34,439 --> 00:04:36,990
AN ARGUMENT LIKE WAIT A MINUTE,
IF I'M OPPOSED TO SOMETHING

98
00:04:36,990 --> 00:04:41,759
IN MY TAXES ARE USED FOR A
PROGRAM I DISAGREE WITH

99
00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:43,650
MAYBE THAT DOES VIOLATE MY
FREEDOM OF SPEECH.

100
00:04:43,650 --> 00:04:46,280
HAS AN INTERESTING RING TO IT.

101
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:50,669
NO, YOUR TAXES ARE USED FOR
THINGS YOU DISAGREE WITH

102
00:04:50,669 --> 00:04:51,669
ALL OF THE TIME.

103
00:04:51,669 --> 00:04:53,750
MY TAXES WERE USED TO EVADE A
RACK.

104
00:04:53,750 --> 00:04:56,030
I REALLY REALLY DISAGREE WITH
THAT.

105
00:04:56,030 --> 00:04:58,410
JUST BECAUSE MY TAXES WERE USED
FOR THAT,

106
00:04:58,410 --> 00:04:59,650
YOU SHOULD SUE.

107
00:04:59,650 --> 00:05:00,889
COLLECTED BY LAWSUIT.

108
00:05:00,889 --> 00:05:04,020
JUST BECAUSE I DISAGREED WITH
THE GOVERNMENT ACTION THAT

109
00:05:04,020 --> 00:05:08,030
WAS TAKEN WITH MY TAXPAYER MONEY
DOESN'T MEAN THEY ELATED MY

110
00:05:08,030 --> 00:05:09,280
FIRST AMENDMENT RIGHTS.

111
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:12,120
I COULD ALSO SPEAK OUT AGAINST
THE IRAQ WAR AND DID.

112
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:15,910
THAT IS MY FIRST AMENDMENT
RIGHT, NOTHING YOU GET TO

113
00:05:15,910 --> 00:05:18,219
USE TAXES FOR ONLY THE THINGS I
AGREE WITH.

114
00:05:18,219 --> 00:05:21,069
BY THE WAY, CONSERVATIVES, YOU
WANT TO REALLY TINGLE WITH

115
00:05:21,069 --> 00:05:22,169
THAT ONE?

116
00:05:22,169 --> 00:05:23,659
LET'S GO TO THE POLLS AND FIND
OUT WHAT THE AMERICAN

117
00:05:23,659 --> 00:05:27,020
PEOPLE ARE ACTUALLY FAVOR OF AND
IF YOU DO ANYTHING OPPOSITE

118
00:05:27,020 --> 00:05:29,630
TO THAT LIKE TAX CUTS FOR THE
RICH, SORRY, YOU VIOLATED

119
00:05:29,630 --> 00:05:31,259
OUR FIRST AMENDMENT RIGHTS.

120
00:05:31,259 --> 00:05:35,139
SUBSIDIES, YOU TAKE OUR TAXPAYER
MONEY AND GIVE ITS OIL

121
00:05:35,139 --> 00:05:38,300
COMPANIES, THE MOST PROFITABLE
RICHEST COUNTRIES IN THE WORLD?

122
00:05:38,300 --> 00:05:40,610
SORRY, YOU VIOLATED MY FIRST
AMENDMENT RIGHTS, I DON'T

123
00:05:40,610 --> 00:05:41,939
AGREE WITH THAT.

124
00:05:41,939 --> 00:05:47,490
THAT IS NOT A REAL LEGAL CLAIM,
IT'S JUST A WAY TO TRY TO SHUT

125
00:05:47,490 --> 00:05:50,870
REGULAR PEOPLE UP AND MAINTAIN
POWER ONLY FOR THE RICH.

126
00:05:50,870 --> 00:05:52,659
LIBERTARIAN LAW FIRM?

127
00:05:52,659 --> 00:05:56,660
HOW MANY OF THOSE ARE THERE?

128
00:05:56,660 --> 00:05:59,990
WHERE IS THE LAWSUIT AGAINST ALL
THIS DARK MONEY, AGAINST

129
00:05:59,990 --> 00:06:00,990
THE COKE BROTHERS?

130
00:06:00,990 --> 00:06:05,770
HONESTLY, THIS IS THE
LIBERTARIAN SORT OF INSANE

131
00:06:05,770 --> 00:06:09,919
CIRCLE JERK THAT IS JUST LIKE
WHEN ARE WE DECRYING ALL

132
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:11,850
THE MONEY THAT IS IN OUR
POLITICS HERE?

133
00:06:11,850 --> 00:06:12,850
DEVILS ADVOCATE, POSSIBLY,
ESPECIALLY BECAUSE YOU ARE

134
00:06:12,850 --> 00:06:13,850
ON THE PANEL.

135
00:06:13,850 --> 00:06:14,850
1ST OF ALL HE WANT TO SAY THAT
THESE SORTS OF EXPERIMENTS

136
00:06:14,850 --> 00:06:15,850
HAPPENING IN CITY AND STATES I
THINK IS ONE OF THE BEST

137
00:06:15,850 --> 00:06:16,850
THINGS ABOUT AMERICA, THAT WE
CAN DO THIS, THAT'S WHY IT

138
00:06:16,850 --> 00:06:17,850
MAKES HIM ANY VIDEOS ABOUT THE
EXPERIMENTS WITH INCOME AND

139
00:06:17,850 --> 00:06:18,850
THE HIGHER MINIMUM WAGES AND
CITIES, ALL OF THAT.

140
00:06:18,850 --> 00:06:19,850
DEVILS ADVOCATE THOUGH,
THEORETICALLY, AND I KNOW THAT

141
00:06:19,850 --> 00:06:20,850
THEY ARE NOT MUTUALLY EXCLUSIVE,
IF THE PROBLEM IS MONEY IN

142
00:06:20,850 --> 00:06:21,850
POLITICS, IS THE SOLUTION MORE
MONEY AND POLITICS?

143
00:06:21,850 --> 00:06:22,850
BECAUSE THIS PROGRAM DOES SORT
OF SAY MONEY IS SPEECH,

144
00:06:22,850 --> 00:06:23,850
SPEECHES MONEY.

145
00:06:23,850 --> 00:06:24,850
OKAY, HOLD ON.

146
00:06:24,850 --> 00:06:25,850
IT'S A PERFECTLY GOOD QUESTION.

147
00:06:25,850 --> 00:06:26,850
THAT IS WAY ACTUALLY, I AM NOT
SPENDING TIME OR ENERGY, MEANING

148
00:06:26,850 --> 00:06:27,850
WHAT

149
00:06:27,850 --> 00:06:28,850
I PUSH FOR IN WOLFPAC IN THIS
DIRECTION BECAUSE I THINK WE

150
00:06:28,850 --> 00:06:29,850
SHOULD GO IN THE OPPOSITE
DIRECTION OF MONEY IS NOT SPEECH

151
00:06:29,850 --> 00:06:30,850
AND WE SHOULD JUST PUBLICLY
FINANCE ALL ELECTIONS PERIOD.

152
00:06:30,850 --> 00:06:31,850
NO PRIVATE FINANCING.

153
00:06:31,850 --> 00:06:36,370
I AM NOT GIVING YOU $100 VOUCHER
WHILE THE KOCH BROTHERS HAVE

154
00:06:36,370 --> 00:06:38,770
$400 MILLION THEY ARE GOING TO
PUT INTO THIS ELECTION CYCLE.

155
00:06:38,770 --> 00:06:40,610
I'M GOING TO TAKE ALL THE MONEY
OUT.

156
00:06:40,610 --> 00:06:43,560
IF YOU PRIVATELY FINANCED
ELECTIONS, YOU WILL HAVE

157
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:46,770
REPRESENTATIVES WORKING FOR THE
PEOPLE WHO FINANCE THEM.

158
00:06:46,770 --> 00:06:48,860
IF YOU PUBLICLY FINANCED
ELECTIONS, THEY MIGHT

159
00:06:48,860 --> 00:06:50,949
ACTUALLY WORK FOR YOU, THE
PUBLIC.

160
00:06:50,949 --> 00:06:54,680
ONE THING THAT IS OVERPLAYED
IN MY OPINION ABOUT THIS

161
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:57,319
LEGISLATION IS THAT PEOPLE KEEP
TALKING ABOUT THE HOMELESS,

162
00:06:57,319 --> 00:06:59,080
BUT NO, EVERYBODY GETS A
VOUCHER.

163
00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:02,419
THE HOMELESS ALSO GET IT WHICH
IS AMAZING BECAUSE IN OUR

164
00:07:02,419 --> 00:07:05,710
WORLD WE ARE LIKE, HOMELESS, ARE
YOU EVEN HUMAN?

165
00:07:05,710 --> 00:07:06,710
YES,

166
00:07:06,710 --> 00:07:09,740
WE TREATED THEM AS HOMO SAPIENS,
GREAT, AMAZING.

167
00:07:09,740 --> 00:07:11,289
BUT EVERYBODY GETS A VOUCHER.

168
00:07:11,289 --> 00:07:14,449
YOU ARE A CARPENTER, A SMALL
BUSINESS OWNER, WORK FOR

169
00:07:14,449 --> 00:07:16,309
MINIMUM WAGE, YOU GET ONE.

170
00:07:16,309 --> 00:07:18,400
IT IS NOT MY PREFERRED

171
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:22,740
ROUTE, BUT IT IS WAY BETTER
THAN THE CURRENT SYSTEM SO I

172
00:07:22,740 --> 00:07:24,699
WANT TO SUPPORT ALL THE PEOPLE
DOING DIFFERENT KINDS OF

173
00:07:24,699 --> 00:07:27,400
EXPERIMENTATION TO GET TO THE
RIGHT ANSWER.

174
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:29,539
I HAPPEN TO THINK THERE'S A
LITTLE BIT OF OVEREMPHASIS

175
00:07:29,539 --> 00:07:32,539
ON THIS PARTICULAR TRACK, BUT
THEY GOT IT DONE IN SEATTLE AND

176
00:07:32,539 --> 00:07:35,999
I WANT THEM TO SUCCEED AND MAYBE
BY THE WAY, MAYBE THAT IS A

177
00:07:35,999 --> 00:07:36,999
BETTER TRACK.

178
00:07:36,999 --> 00:07:38,349
LET'S FIND OUT.

179
00:07:38,349 --> 00:07:42,379
IT'S CERTAINLY WAY BETTER THAN
WHAT WE HAVE NOW.

180
00:07:42,379 --> 00:07:45,289
IT AT LEAST EVENS THE PLAYING
FIELD A LITTLE BIT SO GREAT

181
00:07:45,289 --> 00:07:50,729
CREDIT TO THE PEOPLE WHO GOT IT
DONE AND IF THE COURTS REJECT

182
00:07:50,729 --> 00:07:54,660
THIS, FOR CHRIST'S SAKE.

183
00:07:54,660 --> 00:07:57,319
THE PROBLEM WITH THE COURTS IS
THAT POLITICIANS APPOINT

184
00:07:57,319 --> 00:08:01,559
THEM AND POLITICIANS ARE NOW
ALMOST COMPLETELY CORRUPTED

185
00:08:01,559 --> 00:08:04,969
AND IT IS GOING UPSTREAM
TOWARD THE COURTS AND IT HAS,

186
00:08:04,969 --> 00:08:07,819
THAT'S WHY THE SUPREME COURT
IS CORRUPTED.

187
00:08:07,819 --> 00:08:08,819
WE HAVE TO HURRY.

188
00:08:08,819 --> 00:08:12,140
THAT IS WHY, AGAIN, I WANT AN
AMENDMENT TO END ALL OF

189
00:08:12,140 --> 00:08:13,140
THIS NONSENSE.

190
00:08:13,140 --> 00:08:15,400
THE ONLY THING ABOVE THE COURTS
AS AN AMENDMENT.

191
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:16,930
LET'S DO BOTH THOUGH.

192
00:08:16,930 --> 00:08:22,419
IF YOU ARE DOING THIS, GODSPEED
TO YOU AND WE ALL HAVE YOUR

193
00:08:22,419 --> 00:08:25,699
BACK, BUT LET'S ALSO MAKE SURE
WE GET AN AMENDMENT TO END

194
00:08:25,699 --> 00:08:27,499
ALL THE NONSENSE.

195
00:08:27,499 --> 00:00:00,000
WOLFñPAC.COM TO DO THAT.
