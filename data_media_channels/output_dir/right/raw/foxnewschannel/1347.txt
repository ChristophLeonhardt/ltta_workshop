1
00:00:02,377 --> 00:00:02,678
PART.

2
00:00:02,678 --> 00:00:04,146
WHAT DID RUSSIA DO?

3
00:00:04,146 --> 00:00:04,780
>> Martha: THANK YOU VERY

4
00:00:04,780 --> 00:00:05,080
MUCH.

5
00:00:05,080 --> 00:00:05,747
GOOD TO SEE YOU,

6
00:00:05,747 --> 00:00:06,148
CONGRESSMAN.

7
00:00:06,148 --> 00:00:08,016
>> YES, MA’AM.

8
00:00:08,016 --> 00:00:08,684
>> Martha: ALSO WITH US

9
00:00:08,684 --> 00:00:10,018
TONIGHT FOX NEWS SENIOR

10
00:00:10,018 --> 00:00:11,753
JUDICIAL ANALYST JUDGE

11
00:00:11,753 --> 00:00:12,688
ANDREW NAPOLITANO WHO HAS

12
00:00:12,688 --> 00:00:14,223
BEEN LISTENING TO THIS.

13
00:00:14,223 --> 00:00:15,691
YOUR THOUGHTS, JUDGE ON WHAT

14
00:00:15,691 --> 00:00:17,059
THE CONGRESSMAN AND I WERE

15
00:00:17,059 --> 00:00:18,627
TALKING IN TERMS OF THIS SPY

16
00:00:18,627 --> 00:00:19,294
ISSUE WHETHER OR NOT THE

17
00:00:19,294 --> 00:00:19,862
PRESIDENT SHOULD BE

18
00:00:19,862 --> 00:00:20,396
CONCERNED ABOUT IT.

19
00:00:20,396 --> 00:00:21,630
>> FULL DISCLOSURE,

20
00:00:21,630 --> 00:00:23,332
CONGRESSMAN GOWDY AND I ARE

21
00:00:23,332 --> 00:00:24,133
BUDDIES AND WE HAVE

22
00:00:24,133 --> 00:00:24,967
DISCUSSED THIS BEFORE I

23
00:00:24,967 --> 00:00:26,769
LISTENED TO HIM TONIGHT.

24
00:00:26,769 --> 00:00:27,937
HE IS REALLY THE PERFECT

25
00:00:27,937 --> 00:00:29,305
PERSON TO TALK TO ABOUT THIS

26
00:00:29,305 --> 00:00:30,573
BECAUSE HE HAS SEEN A LOT OF

27
00:00:30,573 --> 00:00:31,540
THINGS THAT THE REST OF US

28
00:00:31,540 --> 00:00:34,643
HAVE NOT SEEN.

29
00:00:34,643 --> 00:00:36,312
BUT THE ALLEGATIONS BY MAYOR

30
00:00:36,312 --> 00:00:37,113
GIULIANI OVER THE WEEKEND

31
00:00:37,113 --> 00:00:38,047
WHICH WOULD LEAD TO US

32
00:00:38,047 --> 00:00:38,948
BELIEVE THAT THE TRUMP

33
00:00:38,948 --> 00:00:40,049
PEOPLE THINK THAT THE FBI

34
00:00:40,049 --> 00:00:43,719
HAD AN UNDERCOVER AGENT WHO

35
00:00:43,719 --> 00:00:45,354
HIS WAY INTO THE CAMPAIGN

36
00:00:45,354 --> 00:00:47,356
AND WAS THERE AS A SPY ON

37
00:00:47,356 --> 00:00:49,325
THE CAMPAIGN SEEM TO BE

38
00:00:49,325 --> 00:00:49,692
BASELESS.

39
00:00:49,692 --> 00:00:50,359
THERE IS NO EVIDENCE FOR

40
00:00:50,359 --> 00:00:51,260
THAT WHATSOEVER.

41
00:00:51,260 --> 00:00:52,528
BUT THE OTHER ALLEGATION

42
00:00:52,528 --> 00:00:53,663
ABOUT THIS PROFESSOR WHOSE

43
00:00:53,663 --> 00:00:55,231
NAME WE ARE NOT SUPPOSED TO

44
00:00:55,231 --> 00:00:56,399
MENTION, TALKING TO PEOPLE

45
00:00:56,399 --> 00:00:57,767
ON THE PERIPHERY OF THE

46
00:00:57,767 --> 00:01:00,536
CAMPAIGN, THAT IS STANDARD

47
00:01:00,536 --> 00:01:02,505
OPERATING PROCEDURE IN

48
00:01:02,505 --> 00:01:04,007
INTELLIGENCE GATHERING AND

49
00:01:04,007 --> 00:01:05,775
IN CRIMINAL INVESTIGATIONS.

50
00:01:05,775 --> 00:01:06,543
>> Martha: ALL RIGHT.

51
00:01:06,543 --> 00:01:08,278
BUT, OBVIOUSLY, THE

52
00:01:08,278 --> 00:01:09,412
PRESIDENT IS CONCERNED ABOUT

53
00:01:09,412 --> 00:01:10,713
THE EXISTENCE OF THAT

54
00:01:10,713 --> 00:01:11,047
PERSON.

55
00:01:11,047 --> 00:01:12,749
HE FEELS LIKE THERE WAS

56
00:01:12,749 --> 00:01:15,719
SOMEONE SPYING ON THE

57
00:01:15,719 --> 00:01:16,853
CAMPAIGN AND IT JUST GOES

58
00:01:16,853 --> 00:01:17,821
BACK TO THE OTHER QUESTION

59
00:01:17,821 --> 00:01:18,989
ABOUT IF THAT WERE THE CASE,

60
00:01:18,989 --> 00:01:20,056
AND THE PRESIDENT SAID I

61
00:01:20,056 --> 00:01:21,324
WANT TO KNOW IF ANYBODY IS

62
00:01:21,324 --> 00:01:22,792
WORKING WITH RUSSIA, WHY WAS

63
00:01:22,792 --> 00:01:24,661
HE NOT SORT OF CLUED IN TO

64
00:01:24,661 --> 00:01:25,595
THAT AND HE TALKED ABOUT

65
00:01:25,595 --> 00:01:26,897
THAT IN A TWEET OVER THIS

66
00:01:26,897 --> 00:01:27,597
WEEKEND, TOO.

67
00:01:27,597 --> 00:01:28,498
SHOULD HE HAVE BEEN?

68
00:01:28,498 --> 00:01:30,500
>> IN MY OPINION, YES.

69
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:31,902
BUT, QUITE FRANKLY, THAT’S A

70
00:01:31,902 --> 00:01:33,503
JUDGMENT CALL.

71
00:01:33,503 --> 00:01:34,838
SOMETIMES YOU DON’T WANT TO

72
00:01:34,838 --> 00:01:35,972
TELL PEOPLE THAT YOU ARE

73
00:01:35,972 --> 00:01:38,141
WORRIED ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT

74
00:01:38,141 --> 00:01:39,409
THEIR ORGANIZATION HAS BEEN

75
00:01:39,409 --> 00:01:40,711
INVADED, SO TO SPEAK.

76
00:01:40,711 --> 00:01:41,612
BECAUSE YOU DON’T WANT THAT

77
00:01:41,612 --> 00:01:45,482
WORD TO GET OUT THERE.

78
00:01:45,482 --> 00:01:46,116
>> Martha: JUDGE, THEY ARE

79
00:01:46,116 --> 00:01:47,251
CLAIMING THAT INVASION WAS

80
00:01:47,251 --> 00:01:49,119
SO DEEP IT IMPACTED THE

81
00:01:49,119 --> 00:01:49,586
OUTCOME OF THE

82
00:01:49,586 --> 00:01:50,120
INVESTIGATION.

83
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:51,488
THAT’S WHAT JIM CLAPPER

84
00:01:51,488 --> 00:01:51,789
SAYS.

85
00:01:51,789 --> 00:01:53,023
>> YES.

86
00:01:53,023 --> 00:01:54,558
>> Martha: THAT’S A CRIME IN

87
00:01:54,558 --> 00:01:54,925
PROGRESS.

88
00:01:54,925 --> 00:01:56,560
HOW YOU CANNOT STEP IN SAY

89
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:58,395
YOU, YOU AND YOU ARE OFF THE

90
00:01:58,395 --> 00:01:58,762
CAMPAIGN.

91
00:01:58,762 --> 00:02:00,297
WE WANT TO KNOW WHO YOU HAVE

92
00:02:00,297 --> 00:02:01,065
BEEN TALKING TO.

93
00:02:01,065 --> 00:02:02,733
IS IT NOT STOPPING A CRIME

94
00:02:02,733 --> 00:02:03,133
IN PROGRESS?

95
00:02:03,133 --> 00:02:04,635
>> I UNDERSTAND THE

96
00:02:04,635 --> 00:02:05,336
PRESIDENT’S FRUSTRATION THAT

97
00:02:05,336 --> 00:02:07,404
HE WAS NOT INFORMED OF THE

98
00:02:07,404 --> 00:02:09,440
FACT THAT HIS CAMPAIGN WAS

99
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:10,374
BEING INVESTIGATED.

100
00:02:10,374 --> 00:02:11,542
NOT BECAUSE THEY THINK THE

101
00:02:11,542 --> 00:02:13,477
CAMPAIGN DID ANYTHING WRONG

102
00:02:13,477 --> 00:02:15,479
BUT SOME PEOPLE MAY HAVE

103
00:02:15,479 --> 00:02:17,348
UNWITTINGLY OR PERHAPS

104
00:02:17,348 --> 00:02:18,549
WITTINGLY WELCOMED THE

105
00:02:18,549 --> 00:02:20,618
RUSSIAN INVOLVEMENT IN THE

106
00:02:20,618 --> 00:02:21,285
CAMPAIGN THAT DONALD TRUMP

107
00:02:21,285 --> 00:02:22,453
DIDN’T KNOW ABOUT IT WHAT I

108
00:02:22,453 --> 00:02:24,288
HAVE TOLD THE CANDIDATE I

109
00:02:24,288 --> 00:02:24,922
WOULD HAVE.

110
00:02:24,922 --> 00:02:25,957
BUT I RESPECT THE JUDGMENT

111
00:02:25,957 --> 00:02:27,391
OF THOSE WHO DECIDED NOT TO

112
00:02:27,391 --> 00:02:28,092
TELL HIM.

113
00:02:28,092 --> 00:02:29,460
NOW, LOOK, IF THEY WERE

114
00:02:29,460 --> 00:02:31,462
THERE FOR SOME NEFARIOUS

115
00:02:31,462 --> 00:02:33,064
REASON, THE ONE GIULIANI

116
00:02:33,064 --> 00:02:34,165
SUGGESTED, TO GATHER DATA

117
00:02:34,165 --> 00:02:35,133
FROM THE CAMPAIGN AND PASS

118
00:02:35,133 --> 00:02:36,300
IT TO THE WEST WING AND PASS

119
00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:37,735
IT TO MRS. CLINTON, I WOULD

120
00:02:37,735 --> 00:02:38,903
WANT TO SEE EVIDENCE OF THAT

121
00:02:38,903 --> 00:00:00,000
BEFORE I MADE AN ALLEGATION
