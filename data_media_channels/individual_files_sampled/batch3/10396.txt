one welcome to worlds apart it is often said that the United Nations is only as good as its member states allow it to be but what happens when those member states deliberately start to act up can't the institution itself its legacy these synergies it cranes proof that the whole is greater than the sum of its parts well to discuss that I'm now joined by the United Nations secretary-general Antonio Guterres secretary-general first of all let me welcome you here in Moscow it's great to see you thank you very much for your time let me start with congratulating you on of Portugal's victory over Morocco on Wednesday did you have a chance to watch the game yes I watched the game and let's be clear when we won the game but we didn't play very well exactly and that's why you're leading me to my next question because according to that game stats the Moroccan swear batter across the board in terms of the possession of the ball in terms of the shot shots on-target etc but they still lost and I wonder if you often see this kind of dynamic at the United Nations when the country puts up a good game but the final score is still not in its favor no it happens all the time not only that everywhere I mean I remember in football in the past so we sometimes there's very good teams and we would lose the games and say we warned mortally I think yesterday we have lost morally but what betters is now not in football but in the context of international relations what is essential is for countries to be able to come together and to face the global challenges we have today that are dramatic challenges understanding that we cannot do it alone with multilateral organizations and we need multilateral governance and you need International Cooperation speaking of which the biggest most influential player in the UN is still the United States which just recently withdrew from the UN Human Rights Council I understand that the objects of it are not very positive within actual terms what kind of a fallout do you expect from that well of course I would strongly prefer and I said system is the first moment that the United States would stay in the Human Rights Council I believe the human rights architecture is a very important element in the awareness right is one of the pillars United Nations and I hope that sooner or later sooner rather than later the US will be able to come back as I said I strongly believe that in today's world we need multilateral responses the Americans cited both criticism and bias as as the reasons for the walkout and the United Nations Security Council certainly is not the only body to criticize either Israel or the United States for that matter I wonder if you have any concerns at all whether that kind of precedent could be repeated and if the United States can pull out from the United Nations all together I mean let's let's be clear the United States plays a very important role in the United States is a founding member like the Russians and of course one thing is to be out of one or two areas that are more outside peripheric the other thing is to be of course involved in the center level activities of the UN and I believe this will go on more I am a true believer that when one looks at United States and the Russian Federation those two countries have in many aspects common interests sometimes they are fighting but they have common interests and if we look at the Middle East that is the area that we have been that was mentioned about this decision the global Middle East in the area where I'm I strongly believe that geostrategic interests of the United States and the Russian Federation and not antimony on the country I think the Geo synthetic endures are similar and I strongly hope that the divisions that have existed the countries will be overcome and that the two countries will be able to have a strong cooperation allowing the international system to work there is no way in which the international system like ours can work without a solid cooperation between the two most important superpowers let me ask specifically about the reasons cited for the American walkout these allegations of bias is certainly not new I'm sure you've heard Russia China Sea or many other countries make similar claims after unfavorable votes but none of them ever walked out of the Council simply because I think most of them realized that they are not limited to one single issue they the value of the council is broader do you take this American withdrawal to mean that the United States at this moment of time doesn't care about anything else but Israel now look in relation to the Human Rights Council the u.s. position has not always been the same the West was out then it came in now is going out again which means that there is a I see a balance in the American public opinion and in the American institutions depending on the party that the party that is in that has shown different attitudes in relation to the Human Rights Council so I don't think we should generalize these I think this is a very specific area where we have always in the US with a I would say position in positional position in so let's hope that in the future the US would come back now speaking about the the nature of that criticism I know that the UN envoy and poverty Philip Alston has just submitted a report very critical of trumps president Trump's tax overhaul claiming that it overwhelmingly benefited the wealthy and worsened inequality and I wonder even if that is perhaps a little bit too personal it's one thing to criticize any given country's track record and another thing to you know - individual president's policies before it was actually fully implemented we have in the UN several things you have the UN Secretariat you have the different bodies namely the Security Council the General Assembly Minh Rights Council and anyway of Special Rapporteurs that act independently and that present the reports criticising countries here and there on the most different issues which of course do not necessarily represent the position of the enemy in its entirety my position on this has always been very clear I think it is better to do it always taking the country into account not personalizing things and in the UN with a very strong concern in the UN Secretariat we need to be impartial and we need not to politicize issues to treat them based on the truth and based on the charter of the United Nations but I didn't suggesting that certain people within the UN went against your direct advice because if I if you let me to call that report it specifically pointed out that the policies pursued over the past year seem deliberately designed to remove basic protections from the court it seems like a fairly targeted short usually said this is a report by a Special Rapporteur that is independent it's it's an opinion that of course needs to be taken into account can see that but doesn't represent the position the formal position of the UN but you know those are very delicate issues because I'm sure you would agree with me that the the position of the American president of President Trump at this point of time his actions are crucial for the future of your organization and he's known as somebody who is very sensitive and sometimes very reactive to the criticism do you think that kind of statements are wise in the current environment I don't think it will be the reason for any crisis as I said in my way the two of doing things different people does things in different ways my way to do things and to do my job is not to personalize and to do things based on impartiality and the objective analysis of situations but of course people are different we have and I think it's important when you have independent reporters on these kind of issues to respect their independence that doesn't mean that we subscribe what we say but we respect that independence because if not everybody then will be manipulated and this of course would completely undermine the respectability of those independent bodies that are an important component of the international community but of course as I said independent reporters are one thing the UN Secretariat is another now let me ask you about one more issue that's a lot in the news today that you yourself weighed in and this is the Trump administration's immigration policy particularly the practice of separating children from their parents who cross into the United States legally mr. Trump has just sought to reverse that policy by his executive order and I wonder what the US Secretary General have really understood how this man functions what can possibly persuade him to change his mind as he just did on the immigration they should personalize things I think we need to look at policies his policies exist when that policy was published was to say that in my opinion that is not a good thing my experience as a Commissioner for Refugees is always that to separate families is something that can have very negative consequences for the people and then of course for the society in general and I'm glad that the policy will be reversed and I've seen that many other actors in the international community and in the US politics including in the family expressed their opinion as I said let's the best way to be active in my opinion is not to personalize is to look into things objectively and if we do it in a way that is impersonal if you do it in a way that is objective I think that's the best way to convince people to do the right thing let's try to look at it and partially Trump's policies are usually couched in moral terms but I think there is a very real legal dilemma there it is not good in any way to separate children from their parents but I think it would also agree that the United States is entitled and has the right to prosecute people who cross into its territory illegally so I wonder whether the humane way would be to put those children in jail together with their parents or perhaps to brand those parents a waiver from prosecution simply because they happen to be parents well countries have the right to have their own migration policies but migration policies need also to respect human rights migration policies in the management of borders it's also to be protective sensitive namely respecting international refugee law I myself am against the criminalization of someone just because someone entered not legally in the country you see refugees there's no other chance to escape but to cross the border that not in a legal way so I'm not in favor of the policy of our criminalization but as I said I recognize countries have the right to define their own migration policies what is important is that they do it in respect to human rights 3min dignity because migrants are also human beings that need to be considered and respected absolutely and we would all do our best for our children but I think I mean I don't represent Fox News here but I think it is important to recognize that we are not talking about you know Syrian mothers fleeing for their lives we are talking about Mexican mothers and fathers who try to find a better future for their kids but they they're living a vibrant developing country so I I'm Portuguese in the 60s 1,500,000 portuguese left that country at the time walking into France and they were basically moving because of poverty and basically because they wanted a better life now it doesn't mean that I think everybody should do it but I have a lot of respect for people that in the case of the Mediterranean put their lives at risk crossing the Mediterranean with the aspiration to provide for their children a better life and when they could have so again I am totally against smuggling their people but I have a deep respect for the people that try to do something to come out look at Honduras Salvador and and Guatemala there is more people killed in these countries by the different gangs that operate then in the Syrian war so we are in situations that are sometimes desperate which means that in these flows of people you have people that flee only because of economic reasons but we have also people that have been victims of persecution so again countries have the right to define their policies countries have the right to send back migrants but all that needs to be done in respect for the basic human rights and for the dignity of people now migration is obviously a very contentious issue not only in the United States but also in Europe which used to be as you just pointed out more welcoming towards migrants and refugees let me tell you something about my English my mother is 94 years old what was not a very rich country as you know my mother is 94 years old I visit my mother when I go back to port every month and she has always one person taking care of it 24 hours by 24 hours independently of the family I've never seen a Portuguese taking care of my mother and in most of the European countries you have fertility indexes of 1.2 1.3 1.4 migration is also necessary what is this what is needed in my opinion is to recognize that need and then to organize it with interest to avoid is illegal migration to organize migration to create opportunities for legal migration taking into account the in sub-sites and the instance of people we need to look at migration as a normal thing in which states need to have the responsibility to organize them properly instead of living to this desperate situation in which people flee because there is nothing there is nothing in place to allow for normal flows that take into account the needs of countries of origin and the needs of countries of estimation secretary-general I had a chance to interview you I think it was four years ago when you were UN High Commissioner for Refugees and you said pretty much the same thing that migration has to be managed and balanced in the four years that have passed do you think the countries have learned how to do it in a balanced way that you know that is the problem you have today I think I was right four years ago and I'm still right and the fact that this is not being sincerely assumed it's creating the chaotic situation that we see in many parts of the world in which by aggression became the issue the issue in many electoral campaigns and because of that you see populist countries and of populist parties xenophobic movements and others gaining ground in many countries if migration will be managed properly in respect for the interests of the countries but also for the interests of the people I think these would not be the issue that is driving the politics in so many countries now one of the reasons why migration keeps on increasing and we are now having record number of more than 68 million people being displaced globally one reason displaced by conflict or conflict and you said recently that the number of those violent conflicts is now the highest in 30 years the number of people killed and those conflicts has risen tenfold since 2005 which you said makes conflict prevention and mediation all the more important and I would think that the United Nations is the most natural venue for that why is it not more successful in mediating all those changes you know normally when we are successful nobody notices but I'll just give you an example an example there was an actual election in Liberia and the election Liberia was contested as you know and there was a problem whether the results would be recognized or not I've sent President Obasanjo one of our members of our ally level panel of mediation that's was there in the day talking to the two candidates to make sure that they would accept results and that there would not be a disturbance as we have seen in many other parts and if there was a problem to go to the court and whatever we are now doing the same in mediation together with the African Union and the SAVAK in relation to Madagascar we have done the same in discreetly in Sierra Leone which means there are lots of activity we are mediating at the present moment doing our best to avoid a dramatic battle for the city of what I recognize that the family is wearing it know what what it is is difficult and the reason is very simple power relations is well became much less clear I remember the Cold War I remember a unipolar world now the world is kind of a chaotic it's moving hopefully into a multipolar world and I'm a strong defender of the idea that the world should be organized in a multipolar way but today we have a chaotic world in predictability impunity is the name of the game you see lots of vectors I mean how many armies are there now fighting inside Syria for example it's very difficult to mediate in these circumstances but having said so one reason more to make prevention the priority of priorities to do everything to address root causes of conflict to do everything to create conditions for communities not to create the level of tension that leads them to conflict but you are absolutely right we are far from being successful because this world now is a difficult to all the complex world where we have multiplicity vectors and the multiplicity of spoilers creating havoc in so many areas with the enormous suffering of the people well secretary-general let us take a very short break now we will be back in just a few moments stay tuned welcome back to worlds apart with the UN secretary-general Antonio Guterres secretary-general it's been about the year-and-a-half since you took this position and from the very beginning you were faced with this challenge of the diminishing American presence both in financial terms and some would say moral terms and I assume that led you to rely more on other actors and other players has it worked out did other have other players that of that game in in the light of American diminishing Primus strong supporter said there's a multipolar world so I think we independently of what the United States does I think we need to be able to promote circumstances in which a multiplicity of vectors a symbol more and more relevant role is that you see more and more countries being active in the context of United Nations and that is very much welcome from me independently of the position of the United Nations the United States I mean fortunately until now the United States have in relation to the key financial commitments of the UN maintained their position there are as I said as you said some areas in peripheral areas where the USS left but in relation to the central aspects the US has maintained but independently of that it's important to have a multiplicity of actors and it is that equilibrium that allows for a UN to be more impartial and more effective given how important the United States still is both to the funding in the running of your organization I'm sure as Secretary General you had to run through several contingency plans I wonder in your planning whether you see this change posture of the United States as something temporary that may change to your let's say six years down the line or is it a permanent change I think it's important to recognize first of all that we have been able to maintain with the US a working relationship the US ambassador nikki Haley has been extremely constructive in addressing the difficulties that we face the latest statement about relations talking about relations we're talking about relations with the Secretariat and the solution of the problems that might of course do right they have their own political positions on many issues I'm not talking about that talk about the constructive relationship with the Secretariat I think we have managed to have a constructive relationship and we want to keep it but as I said we we need to have a world and the United Nations in which many actors act together creating an environment of impartiality and equilibrium 12 the world or the United Nations or whatever only dependent on one or two countries is not a good thing well I know you have long argued against you the USS disengagement from global affairs and I wonder if this engagement is the right one because from my point of view it's not that the Trump administration is it's not engaging I think it is engaging in very unorthodox ways for example take North Korea we've just witnessed the first-ever historic meeting between the two heads of state but it came after you know essentially teetering on the brink of a war if you are a very seasoned diplomat what do you think about this kind of approach to diplomacy well let's be honest I think we are facing what can be one of the most important success stories in addressing a complex conflict situation so we can criticize when we can criticize but I must say that a recent summit that took place in Singapore is a remarkable achievement and I congratulate the two leaders that had the courage to do it in circumstances that were complex of course there were lots of episodes before but even during these episodes I remember very well I with the agreement of the six countries as a relevant you know there is a six-party talks with the agreement of the six I've sent my undersecretary general on political affairs at the time Jeffrey Feltman to Pyongyang exactly with the objective to try to prepare the conditions for this kind of the I log to be possible which means even at the heat of the conflict it was possible with the agreement of all for the UN to play a role trying to create the conditions to bring people together that's all well I don't know if you but mr. Trump also suggested that he can apply this kind of personal diplomacy to Russia and for example ask President Putin to get out of Syria or Ukraine I don't know about you I would be a little bit nervous about where that conversation can lead them I want to ask you what do you actually think about the current state of the us-russian relations given the presence the very massive presence of Navy in the present Putin recently and I said to both the same namely in relation to the situation in the Middle East and in Syria my belief that I have said it already that the geostrategic interests of Russia and United States in the Middle East coincide and that in my opinion it's extremely important for the future of the Middle East that the two countries come together and have a common strategy and I think that I mean it is always easy and I understand that from the point of view of the media it's much better if you have big fights but from the point of view of the world it's very important that countries are able to come together to overcome the divisions and to understand that their common interests especially in this world where terrorism became so dangerous their common interests are more important than the difference is that you say that Russian and American common interests in Syria overlap somehow and they are grave doubts and grave concerns in this city that the United States may be moving towards creating some sort of partition in Syria I'm sure you heard John Bolton the national security adviser to mr. Trump advocating the creation of the so-called Sunni Stan which would comprise certain parts of Syria and Iraq what do you think about this idea even if it has a chance to bring we had the opportunity to talk both with Americans and Russians on this issue and one thing that I believe is absolutely essential is to preserve the territorial integrity of Syria as Iraq and other countries in the region to to try now to do some kind of new sykes-picot in my opinion would be a suicide move now there are certain issues that are absolutely essential to the UN legacy one of them is the Palestinian territories it was the United Nations after all which ratified the partition of the Palestine which allowed for the creation of Israel alongside an Arab state the promise that was never and I think that is now actively sabotage do you think the Palestinians still have a reasonable hope of seeing their own state and wouldn't it be more moral more honest to tell them you guys go and build your life somewhere else no I don't think that's it that is acceptable I I'm a strong supporter of the two-state solution I don't think there is a thing it's really I don't think there is a plan B I think that to abandon it is not realistic because to abandon it was to condemn that territory to a kind of confrontation in which the consequences would be absolutely devastating look at what happened recently in Gaza let's not make sure let's make sure that this doesn't be has become the situation in the whole area a two-state solution might still be possible if we overcome the present divisions to abandon that idea in my opinion is a huge risk and I don't think that we can consider that the two-state solution should be abandoned I'm not sure about the anybody I'm sure about what I believe I am a strong believer that the two-state solution is essential because a one-state solution would mean what would mean that everybody would have the same the status quo I don't think it's possible to be maintained never is eternal nothing is eternal in the world and I believe our role is not to maintain status quo in which people suffer and in which the risks for peace and security are there at any every moment I think our role is to overcome the status quo and create a stable peaceful solution where two peoples are able to live together in respect for their own security well secretary-general we have to live but they are really appreciate your time today and I invite our viewers to keep this conversation going on our social media pages and hope to see you again same place same time here on worlds apart
