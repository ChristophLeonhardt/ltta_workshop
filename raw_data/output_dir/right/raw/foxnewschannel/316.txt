LIVES OF THE PEOPLE THAT MATTER

132
00:04:26,076 --> 00:04:27,076

BEEFED UP IN WAYS WE NEVER

00:04:37,421 --> 00:04:40,156
IMAGINED JUST 2 SHORT YEARS AGO.

139
00:04:40,157 --> 00:04:42,024

EVERYTHING ELSE HAS GONE BY THE

142
00:04:43,894 --> 00:04:44,427
WAY SIDE.

143
00:04:44,428 --> 00:04:46,262
ARE YOU OKAY WITH WHAT THEY DID

144
00:04:46,263 --> 00:04:46,963
TO KAVANAUGH?

145
00:04:46,964 --> 00:04:48,397
IS THIS THE AMERICA YOU WANT TO

146
00:04:48,398 --> 00:04:50,666
PASS ON TO YOUR CHILDREN?

DR. FORD WAS HEARD AND

150
00:04:59,209 --> 00:05:01,043
RESPECTFULLY TREATED.

151
00:05:01,044 --> 00:05:02,845
WE WANT A CONSTITUTIONAL PROCESS

152
00:05:02,846 --> 00:05:05,281
THAT PROTECTS ALL OF US.

153
00:05:05,282 --> 00:05:06,415
WHAT DO YOU HAVE TO LOSE?

154
00:05:06,416 --> 00:05:08,151
WELL, IF WE LOSE, YOU HAVE A LOT

155
00:05:08,152 --> 00:05:08,584
TO LOSE.

156
00:05:08,585 --> 00:05:13,122
YOU WILL HAVE A SMALLER MILITARY

157
00:05:13,123 --> 00:05:14,190
AND BIGGER GOVERNMENT.

158
00:05:14,191 --> 00:05:15,691
IF THEY WIN YOU WILL HAVE A

159
00:05:15,692 --> 00:05:17,693
BUNCH OF PEOPLE WHO ARE

160
00:05:17,694 --> 00:05:18,694
ORGANIZED AROUND THE IDEA OF

161
00:05:18,695 --> 00:05:19,228
HATING TRUMP.

162
00:05:19,229 --> 00:05:21,464
THERE IS A LOT TO LOSE IF YOU

163
00:05:21,465 --> 00:05:23,499
TURN OVER POWER TO MY DEMOCRATIC

164
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:23,900
COLLEAGUES.

165
00:05:23,901 --> 00:05:28,871
THERE IS A LOT TO LOSE IN THIS

166
00:05:28,872 --> 00:05:29,872

HAPPENED WITHOUT YOU.
