1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,770
senator what makes you think that you
can win your Republican primary in your

2
00:00:04,770 --> 00:00:10,260
state with the president attacking you
and you going after him the people in

3
00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:16,379
Arizona tend to elect independent minded
principled senators Barry Goldwater John

4
00:00:16,379 --> 00:00:22,320
McCain I think the voters here expect me
to have my own franchise to represent

5
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:27,480
them not to be a rubber stamp for the
president so I'm quite comfortable being

6
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:31,920
where I am I would hate to be tethered
to any president Republican or Democrat

7
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:36,719
in every position they take that's not
what a senator is supposed to do but

8
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:42,149
Senator 88% of Republicans in your home
state of Arizona voted for Donald Trump

9
00:00:42,149 --> 00:00:47,309
in November you might be right about the
general voters in Arizona but we're

10
00:00:47,309 --> 00:00:52,050
talking about an intra Republican war
that it one of the battlefields is right

11
00:00:52,050 --> 00:00:58,829
there and you're leading the charge
against the Trump the Trump voters no

12
00:00:58,829 --> 00:01:02,489
that's not that's not the case
what I'm doing is voting on a

13
00:01:02,489 --> 00:01:06,780
conservative basis that's my philosophy
I will support the president when I

14
00:01:06,780 --> 00:01:10,590
believe he's right I've supported many
of the agenda items that he's put

15
00:01:10,590 --> 00:00:00,000
forward I'll oppose those that I think
he's wrong on
