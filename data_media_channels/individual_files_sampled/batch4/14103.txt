you I'm answer levan it's June 21st and you're watching battleground oh hi everybody I am Ezra Levant I am the rebel commander here at the rebel dot media we're based in Canada we have viewers around the world we talk about things in the United States and the UK here in Canada and elsewhere of course and for about a month and a half now we've been doing this thing called super chat it's a new invention by YouTube it's live chat live streaming which is not new in itself but the super chat feature that's what's new that's what YouTube calls it it lets people make comments that are put in a bold highlight and appended to the top of the comment box there by paying couple bucks five bucks I've even seen someone put in 50 bucks and what's great for content creators like us is that youtube shares the dough with us I think we get 70% of the revenues or something I'm not sure so it's a good way to replace the revenue that YouTube demonetised from conservative commentary sites from us but it's also a fun way I mean I see I think I saw one just popped by there a second ago up no I didn't it it when it's in super chat it's very bright to see we've talked a lot about different things over the last few months including a big subject for the last month is Tommy Robinson and his imprisonment Tommy used to work for us as our reporter in the UK he went independent earlier this spring but we kept in touch and we were shocked when he was swiftly arrested and thrown in prison short hours thereafter and we've been helping out a little bit with a crowdfunding campaign to pay for as long as I understand we might have some news on the legal front as soon as today wouldn't that be good I'm not saying it's over I'm saying that we're fighting back but you knew that already from going to save Tommy I don't have any Tommy news for you today I probably will have some tomorrow but I will talk about some other things that it's just I tell you the Trump derangement syndrome it is strong out there what do you think should happen if an unaccompanied minor that is a young person crosses the border illegally from Mexico without his parents what should be done with that child if they're in the hands of a human trafficker like a game like ms-13 or just some non gang you know smuggler should they be set free should they be imprisoned with strange adults of course they should be detained separately and about 80% of the minors who cross the border are not with their own families but let's say they are crossing illegal with their parents should they be put into an adult prison with their their parents and the reason I say prison is because it's breaking the law it's a criminal act to break into the United States it's not a criminal act to walk up to a border crossing and apply for a son that's not against the law there are ten American consulates throughout Mexico where such an application process can be made legally as well you go to the US Embassy or any of the consulates and say hi I'd like to apply for asylum you're not going to be arrested they're going to either say yes or no they'll start by saying fill out the paperwork the reason these kids are detained is because they are accompanying a lawbreaker they themselves are actually breaking the law - although you wouldn't hold a child accountable for that this is not a new thing I'd like to show you some clips showing how long-standing this policy is be I mean did you think it was just invented did you think then until this moment young people were put in that out prisons in America you think that that's how it goes you think for Americans in prison for Canadians in prison for Brits in prison do you think their kids go into prison with them that did you think that's how it was it's almost like the media thinks it's how well hey let's let's start with the Clinton State of the Union address more than 20 years ago listen a little bit - bill we are a nation of immigrants but we are also a nation of laws it is wrong and ultimately self-defeating for a nation of immigrants to met the kind of abuse of our immigration laws we have seen in recent years and we must do more to stop it I'm pretty obvious here's that Diane Feinstein even earlier than that this is going back 25 years now and that's why the issue is now joined with two million illegal immigrants it's it's a competition for space whether the space is a job the space is a home a place in a classroom it becomes a competition for space this is a country that's based on immigration and we all know that and yet at times you become so overtaxed you have to concentrate on saying the people we should be here are those who come legally at this time and we've got to for the time being enforce our borders that's a pretty amazing few amazing things there first of all the Dianne Feinstein has been in the Senate for as long as she has back then she said 2 million illegals the number the lowest estimate today is 13 million but she's so right competition for jobs competition for social services competition for her affections would be something I'd add there are so many illegals in California now that she has decided to throw in her lot with them hasn't she let me show you one more clip this is from Barack Obama just four years ago our message absolutely is don't send your children unaccompanied on trains or through through a bunch of smugglers we don't even know how many of these kids don't make it and may have been waylaid into sex trafficking or killed because they fell off a train we have no way of tracking them so that is our direct message to the families in Central America do not send your children to the borders if they do make it they'll get sent back more importantly they may not make it in answer to his point there we do have estimates of how many of these children are sexually exploited the answers between 40 and 60% so pretty much half of all kids being brought the border our molested raped or exploited pressured into providing sex either to the traffickers themselves or to the people the traffickers payment them out to I think it was yesterday maybe was a day before we showed you some images I think they might have been from the Obama administration of children in detention centers because as you heard there they send them back and before they send them back they detain them and it doesn't look good to have kids in detention but that is how it is so it is in Canada to do we have the website of Canada's child detention let CBC had a little story on it yesterday I'm shocked the CBC even dared to dare to show it you don't think we detain kids as well you think that we put kids Lewis Canada aims to avoid detaining migrant children but it happens hey man it happens McGill study on Canadian practice finds psychiatric and academic difficulties long after detention but look at that headline there it's written so lovingly by Benjamin Schindler of the CBC which is Canada State bracket hey Mon I mean we totally aim to avoid detaining my grandchildren but it happens it's accidental Mon I mean no one really wanted I mean what does that mean Canada aims to I mean either does this suggest it was actually that I'm sorry man I am your kid I totally aimed not to man but it happens it happens I love that passive wording not that is the law of Canada and Justin Trudeau as the chief legislate or in and enforces the law man it happens it just happened hey what's that kid doing it's like you're doing behind but it dude stop being so accusatory that just happens I mean it's like it's like this rash man don't blame me okay I'm gonna stop do it I don't even know what accent or impression that was it's just sort of my my dude it just it just happened okay do we have the Trudeau preening clip is yesterday when the whole of the mainstream media was in absolute freak out mode because like homelessness like any social ills that were ignored for eight years under Barack Obama Obama they have been rediscovered now that there's a Trump to blame you can't blame Trump for unemployment or the economy because it's the best ever unemployment is the lowest ever for blacks the lowest ever for Hispanics I saw that business confidence amongst manufacturers is at 95% the largest ever recorded so you can't blame Trump for economic ills so how about for things that have been going on that would make a fella cry or a journalist cry and that is a detained child do we have the Trudeau web printing clip let's take a look at it right now what's going on in the United States is wrong I can't imagine what the family's living through this are enduring obviously this is not the way we do things in Canada can can you get a clip from the movie the wedding crashers called just the tip I got a call for that clip and it's called just the tip so that's Justin Trudeau putting on his best drama teacher voice you know he does the he does the head bob thing he does he does the eye thing and he gets his romantic voice he gets his sexy voice going on and he he looks at all the reporters especially the lady reporters and he says I just can't believe what these kids are going through and it pains me very deeply and that I'm horrified and ladies I want you to know I'm totally not like that Donald Trump and if I were to grope you like I grew up that female reporter in Creston be seen it would be a pleasant grope not the group of Donald Trump who's an old man so he does his sexy voice do you have just the tip I call it my just the tip voice for those of you who don't know what I'm talking about you've missed a funny movie called the wedding crashers I would like you to hear Vince Vaughn I think that's the name of the actor in the movie the wedding crashers and whenever I hear Justin Trudeau go into his I'm deeply upset about the misogyny of Donald Trump it's not like my misogyny when I grew up that girl in Creston and I want you to know ladies that I'm deeply concerned about Donald Trump putting kids in cages we would never do that in Canada unless as the CBC says it just it just happened we aim not to do that in Canada sometimes it happens but it's not like the states where Donald Trump is a very bad man how we doing with just a tip okay great I'll send it to you you know what I'm talking about a wedding crashers just the tip there it is it's a it's the first thing that pops up oh so that's yeah it's it's an obscure joke but it's I can't help but think of Vince Vaughn when he he's got this it's I'll play it for big enough and we'll play it for you I'll come back to it but I just can't get Justin Trudeau out of when I when I see Justin Trudeau in his sexy voice mode it reminds me of Vince Vaughn in his sexy voice mode we'll get back to that in the meantime what's the opposite of sexy think what is the opposite of sexy like a dead squirrel on the highway what what could you know make you lose the mood in about two seconds Hillary Clinton so here take a look at Hillary Clinton talking about kids and how they got to go back and take a look they should be sent back as soon as it can be determined who responsible adults and their families are because there are concerns about whether all of them can be sent back but I think all of them who can be should be reunited with their families that one there I think so what do you think so what do you think of Hillary Clinton do you think there's been a single politician over the past 20 years who was responsible for administering the US government policy whether it was Democrat a Republican who did not enforce that law now I'm not saying they enforced it with vigor but they all I mean Barack Obama Hillary Clinton when she was in the cabinet that law was enforced you saw clips Bill Clinton Barack Obama Dallin four slots just down the media select we have just a tip all right you're probably thinking answer woody what's this just the tip bit what's that about what are you talking about I'm I want you to watch this just the tip clip from a comedy called wedding crashers and then I want to play that Justin Trudeau clip again and for the rest for the rest of your life when you hear Justin Trudeau going to go into his sexy mode it's he's on the phone he's talking to someone on the phone we don't have it all right okay we'll find it I know you were so deep into this now we got to find it it's the Trudeau voice he puts on when he wants you to know he deeply deeply cares it's the voice he uses when he after a terrorist attack after a Muslim terrorist attack he wants you to know in his sexy voice that this is a time for unity in diversity and ladies diversity is our strength all right keep looking for just the tip because once you see that clip of Vince Vaughn saying just the tip you'll never be able to look at Justin Trudeau without thinking of it because he's such a faker he's a he's a fake substitute drama teacher and it still works I think with about 35% of the population but I point out to you that Justin Trudeau's support in the polls is lower than Donald Trump support in the polls and Justin Trudeau just lost a safe by-election seat in Quebec the Conservatives got more than 50% in like a 5 Party race all right Donald Trump did bend the knee or blink he said all right we're gonna stop some of this separation business so show the clip of Trump do we have a clip of Trump signing the executive order thank you very much we're signing an executive order I consider to be a very important executive order it's about keeping families together while at the same time being sure that we have a very powerful very strong border and border security will be equal if not greater than previously okay you can have a lot of happy people so long time been going on for 60 years 60 years nobody's taking care of it nobody's had the political courage to take care of it but we're going to take care of it it's been going on it's been going on for a long time all right so so what's gonna happen if kids aren't gonna be separated anymore if Donald Trump did blink well then are we gonna send both parents and kids home here's the the blaze with the response from Nancy Pelosi and the Democrats were they pleased they were crying they were bawling they were saying it was nazi-like no no they're actually outraged now that any one of those faces that anyone would still be upset looking at wheat from Camilla Harris who's being touted as a possible presidential contender this executive order doesn't fix the crisis oh hang on I thought it did indefinitely detaining children with their families in camps is inhumane and will not make us safe hang on hang on hang on hang on hang on hang on I thought you didn't want the kids detained separately like Justin Trudeau does and now you're saying you don't want them detained with their families I think you just don't want any illegals detained anywhere ever ever I think that's what's going on here any luck on the just a tip guys no I'll wait for you to tell me if you find it maybe we'll have to do it tomorrow all right I see a couple super chests coming in Craig McDonald says that was your Catherine McKenna axe and a little bit you know Catherine McKenna does vocal fry you know that vocal fry it said it's a Kardashian sound it's when you go that's the Kardashian think she's got the valley girl thing but she's also got the vocal fry I can't do I can't do the vocal fry very well same thing one says leftist logic us is evil yet everyone must enter isn't that the truth if the u.s. is so odious why does everyone want to get in there why does you know why do people leave Mexico for the United States if it's so racist and awful well that's obviously not true so before Trump ended as he accurately describes a policy that predates him by decades they were super grossest we showed you yesterday Peter Fonda saying he wanted the Secretary of Homeland Security literally stripped naked put in a cage lashed and the whole thing filmed that's just like this weird violent fantasy that he just put out there and Twitter didn't ban him his movie studio Sony Pictures didn't drop him compare that to Roseanne bars treatment you had just absolute insanity out there including from Canadians who really want to be part of that Trump derangement down there there's so many Canadians who really really want to be anti Trump warriors including a CBC dramatic actor named Pat - so let me put up his tweet here so hold this up so we have Peter Fonda saying we should rip Baron Trump from his mother's arms put him in a cage with pedophiles and see if mother will stand up against the giant asshole she's married to 90 million people in the streets on the same weekend so so super weird really really really weird and don't from junior barons stepbrother says you're clearly a sick individual and everyone it's an internet badass but rather than attack an eleven-year-old like a bully and a coward why don't you pick on someone a little bit bigger let me know it's a good response by Donald Trump jr. I think and then Pat - so to the rescue don't worry we're coming for Chloe - I think Chloe is the name of one of Donald Trump juniors kids so Pat does so he so digs this sexual violence threat by Henry Fonda Henry Fonda Peter Henry Fonda's against his full name but even after Donald Trump says you're sick stop picking on an 11 year old don't be a bully this freak Pat does so says we're coming for your daughter - what does that mean what is coming for Chloe - I would you rip Chloe away from Donald Trump jr. would you would you kidnap her would you put her in the cage with a pedophile are you a pedophile you saying that you're going to see at least Henry Fonda said with a pedophile so Henry front himself is not saying I am a pedophile he's saying put a make it with a pedophile but here Pat - so switches from a pedophile third person to first person plural wee-wee includes me Pat - so are you coming for Chloe - who's this we you're including yourself in it are you saying that which which part of this are you gonna do are you gonna rip Chloe away from Donald Trump jr. or are you the pedophile or you a bit of both or who the hell are you well go to his IMDB page he's a CBC star Patrick do so so many productions with the CBC you can cease with 20 of this average 22 minutes and all these other CBC productions bunch of other junk - he's a bit of a loser he's with the beaverton TV shows lots of cbc stuff so he made an apology let's read his apology I sincerely apologize to Donald Trump jr. and his family for the reckless tweet that I posted earlier today my careless words were mine alone and do not reflect the values or beliefs of any individual or organization associated with me overwhelmed by recent events of the US border I let my emotions get the best of me and made a failed totally inappropriate attempt at humor Oh always oh is that what that was we're coming for Chloe - is that that it's just a joke haha come on you guys it was just a joke you guys I mean come on you didn't get it yeah I remember I'm truly sorry but it's just a joke you you square I mean what's not funny about you know we're coming for Chloe - we're gonna put her in a cage and and with her pedophile minute and we are gonna rape her or something I don't know what happens we put a child in the cage with the pepper but you guys it's a tempted humor and I was it was emotional I was emotional I let my emotions get the best of me okay so that's the excuse of Pat - so wants for himself and and yeah he's an idiot and maybe he was emotional and not in control of his own emotions and he probably googled Donald Trump juniors kids names I mean who would know offhand um do you know Donald I mean I know Donald Trump's name and he's got a brother named Eric and I think I know the names of their wives I wouldn't want any Vanessa is one of them or something Laura is one of them there's a vodka and cherry okay Beth I've just told you all and Baron I've just told you all the names of the Trump family that I know I don't know the names of the kids you've got to be a little bit creepy how do you know the names of Chloe I assume that's Tom from juniors daughter so this I was emotional man and I started googling Donald Trump's daughter and then I wrote this sick fantasy where I yeah yeah you put a lot of thought into your sick gross sexual violence fantasy didn't you but you just read a little tweet of apology and no problem because you were emotional and come on guys this is a joke I'm a comedian what are you square do you think he's been fired by anyone you think he's but I mean obviously he's still on Twitter he hasn't been stripped of his Twitter account like Peter henry fonda a Roseanne Barr made sort of a lame joke by accident about one of Barack Obama's admirers advisers valerie jarrett i think is her name made a joke about battle of the apes or some Planet of the Apes and I don't think she knew that valerie jarrett was black or half black or something and she immediately apologized but people said oh you're calling her a napier racist she was fired from her number-one show she immediately said she didn't know what it was there was an accident she immediately apologized like 200 apology tweets and it was clear from the context she didn't mean it in that way but she was off with her head but this patch is so that's all it takes and and peter henry fonda you know no problem he's got his movie coming out with so many pictures because look it's it's Trump and his family and of course you're allowed to be indulged indulge in violent sexual fantasies about their children because their trumpets and we know better it's unbelievable let me check I want to make sure I haven't missed any Super chats up there's one there Tom young John my name is Ezra and I'm a funny guy no I'm sorry I haven't been funny today I try my accents they don't work I try you know what I just for an accent to work at least in my case I've got to be I've got to be surrounded by it you've got to be interacting with people with that axe and you've got to really listen and catch the few words that are like the real like he got it like Tommy use of the word mate and bruv and you got it started to start working those in I showed you the clip yesterday of those two British comedians doing Michael Caine like got a really really listen listen listen listen that and and I just can't make the vocal fry' sound all right I want to take a very short break now we have a promo for John Cardillo show called off the cuff and what do you take a look at that will come right back today on off the cuff Declassified a controversial police shooting in East Pittsburg Pennsylvania please shut a young black man in the back but might that have been justified law enforcement expert Ben manage joins me to discuss the detention and arrest process for illegal aliens forget it debunk a lot of bad information president Trump signs an executive order eliminated those filed parent separations at the border or Diddy and Peter Fonda gets a pass for disgraceful tweets that I believe would have gotten any conservative permanently banned from Twitter all right I was trying to find it there I was trying to find Vince Vaughn during the break there I'm gonna find it for tomorrow that's my promise I'm not gonna keep looking for it okay I hear in my ear that my friend Justin has a clip we're gonna try it all why am i is it a funny joke yeah it was sort of funny probably not as funny as I think it is his wedding crashers a funny movie it's a pretty funny movie is this just the tip thing funny I think it was funny I mean I think that movie came out like what 20 years ago and I was younger and my sense of humor is different but his tone of voice his attempted sexy persuasion is exactly the same shyster huckster sound I hear when Justin Trudeau locks eyes and she just had word ladies with any just there's different kind of Justin Trudeau speeches there's the stammer uh that's the Justin Trudeau stammer that sometimes he goes for the sexy substitute teacher and if you just throw in the word ladies okay Justin's been looking for this clip let's see if he's got the clip here's Vince Vaughn you just really want to know we gonna get hopped up enough to make some bad decisions perhaps play a little game called just a tip just for a second just to see how it feels or popped out you're on my hair okay okay you put that's what you can't see it and thank you hey Janice great talk okay maybe that's all it is maybe that's all it is maybe I'm misremembering a stupid joke from my youth but I think that's I think that's the best I'm gonna do um all right let's get back on track I'll give up on the just the tip thing I'll come back I'll come back to you another day with proper clips that show you what I really think of Justin Trudeau when he goes dude drama teacher ladies unlike Donald Trump when I put kids in detention its with love unlike Donald Trump who when he puts kids in detention ladies he does so out of misogyny just try that when when Justin Trudeau is looking at the camera and he shakes his head a little bit just add the word ladies every sentence to what he says and I think that really brings all the true doughnuts of it all right let's take a few more comments I don't see super chest right now over this one here moon man hey bro where's your streaming license that's right that is you know what that's right you need a license in the UK the BBC you got to pay a TV license did you know that it's one of the things I've learned or you brav if you buy a TV and they actually try and track down people who are using TVs that don't have a license and they prosecute I don't know how often they prosecute but it's like a creep you could theoretically I think go to jail in the UK if you don't pay your TV tax it's just it's just one of the the funny wrinkles there okay Sheila Gunn this voice is however convinced me to work first County Sheila ladies no thank god that's not true okay I'm gonna start you know what I've tried way too hard but I did just do that next time you see Jamie there's a different stammer e stuff okay let me give you another wild goose chase Hanna and Justin find Justin Trudeau on North Korea a few months ago when he does this stammer and this pause and Trudeau has like a 30-second pause on North Korea do you know the one I'm talking about so there's your stammer Trudeau you're us and um Trudeau that's the real Trudeau when he's off script and then there's the one where they say okay Justin go in with that Hey ladies so with the hey ladies one if you just add the word ladies you'll be okay okay let's get back on track Gabriel Swift says it's a felony not to have a TV license in the UK well I don't know enough about the law in the UK to know it's at a felony or misdemeanor do they even have that terminology in the UK I hear in my ear that Justin is very quickly found that that Trudeau North Korea's stammer here take a listen we need to ensure that we are working together with our allies to find a path forward there because a nuclear power like North Korea that has shown a level of irresponsibility and fundamentally responsibility to not use a word like crazy which I will not use is is of real concern yeah that was that was sort of a brain hiccup there he was trying not to get in trouble he I mean that's just a really big gap and I think that that was a bird in the background it was like sort of like crickets there wasn't it um I have one more request Hanna and Justin it's the david axelrod triple stumble the full one i want to see all three stumbles I'm really working Hannah and Justin hard today I'm throwing things at them bait we start off our super chats I've got a list of clips and websites in my hand but listen this is sort of the stream just this and I just want to you know I should do a whole show I mean I did a show on Katharine McKenna's vocal fry I did and and you know we should get a clip from that because I actually practiced the vocal fry a lot for that one but we should do one on on Trudeau the valley girl because he I mean you just saw him there but there you know that Justin Trudeau has used marijuana his whole life and he has acknowledged that he continued to use marijuana after he was elected now any healthy media would would have a question about that like who's your dealer where did you smoke were you in in government of canada property like you know the Parliament Buildings were you at your official residence who delivered it to you did were you dealing with like a like a criminal or or did you buy it from your staff who dealt with a criminal or did did you smoke with other MPs or cabinet ministers or your staff or were you smoking at home with your with your kids I mean you're you're a grown man now are you worried that someone might blackmail you you're the prime minister and marijuana was not yet legalized it's actually not yet officially legalized the regulations have not been promulgated so you're the prime minister you're breaking the law are you not worried that someone can blackmail you you're not worried about the police what about the propriety of a lawmaker being a lawbreaker but really I mean how much did you pay and how did you order it did you have like someone and yourself only you did what did your RCMP Guards say or did did they see it what did they say did they did you ask them to usher in the drug dealer was it were you with Gerald BOTS or Catherine McKenna or Seamus Seamus O'Regan who has a lot of substance abuse problems I'm not picking on him I'm just saying maybe you guys get drunk and stoned together something - do you ever smoke up on your flights I mean we know they drink thousands of dollars of booze on those flights his trip to India $5,000 worth of wine there's a lot of wine do you just smoke up all you have you ever smoked drugs in other jurisdictions are you worried about breaking let's see these are normal questions I think that I'm in imagine if Donald Trump acknowledged that he was doing illegal drugs after he was elected I'm not talking about 30 40 50 years ago when he was young I've dug but after he was elected Justin Trudeau has acknowledged that he does drugs I don't know when the last I mean since he's been elected are you not curious who sold him the drugs and when did he use government marrow did he expense mine Justin Trudeau's not good at paying for things himself don't you think there's real questions I want to show you when Trudeau went to Chicago recently Trudeau's visited the United States I checked 15 times he's telling other people boycott USA he can't get enough of the United States he's I was going down and meet political schemers on the Left like David Axelrod or because America's great city he loves going to San Francisco he loves going there Hollywood he loves going to New York who doesn't so when Trudeau says don't go to America we got a boycott then yeah how about you start buddy he's gone 15 times in two years like he just every month or two I mean and so often he takes his whole clan his whole crews whole entourage with them I'm gonna show you a video of when Justin Trudeau flew to Chicago he's been going to the 7 inch or 15 times I think he's only met Trump twice in the States I could be wrong correct me if I'm wrong Amy's three times he goes to the States 15 times cuz he loves meeting he loves meeting leftist activists George Soros he spent with George service several times in the States let me show you what he meant David Axelrod who is if I'm not mistaken the chair campaign chair of Obama's 2008 campaign Oh Axelrod is now he's got some semi academic position or whatever but doesn't even matter and Trudeau was there and true that just flown down so he was on one of these boozy flights and I want to show you Trudeau stands up to shake his hand now maybe you're tired maybe you're I don't know so if you stand up and shake hands and Wabble once I'm not gonna say guys drunk for wobbling once you don't you wobble twice okay you you you were tired and then you stumbled but I call this the triple wobble let me know when we got it it's it's the video of Justin Trudeau at some putt and he had been just answering questions in his dopey way a little bit of the ladies you know I'm different than Donald Trump because I'm a male feminist and he shakes the head of it it's just I like to play a game called just the tip that's what Vince Vaughn my Vince Vaughn joke didn't land today I'm not talking about his lady's voice I'm talking about his substance abuse this is okay to talk about how much he drinks $5,000 on the flight on this trip - it's okay to talk about if I mean if Donald Trump I mean we had drugs we know how the media party covered Rob Ford's various addictions drugs alcohol cruelly is the answer don't you think the questions I asked about Justin Trudeau and drug use they're not cruel they're just real questions hey check out this video Justin Trudeau David Axelrod look at the triple stumble take a look thank you so much and you're free and then another stumble let's and he reaches down to look I think there were five stumbles can you play that again five stumbles stop after each stumble let's take a look at that again I think we need a minute obviously I want to play that again okay go thank you so much okay that it's not a strange sort of a stumble sort of a wobble yet who said stumble was another wobble okay now he's trying to show that he's stable Oh a little wobble he has to steady himself he bends over that was a that wasn't a triple wobble that was a quintuple wobble what do you think should look at this clip from when Trudeau met with that I think that's a I think that's a quintuple wobble what do you think tired disoriented tired from one the guy works like two hours a day skips question period half the time fifty-six vacation since becoming Prime Minister being years tired maybe wouldn't be a jet lag issue Chicago is only one time so over from Ottawa it's very short flight why do you think you wobble bear five times drunk or high or something else my being mean my being meaner than the Toronto Star and the CBC word of Rob Ford alright let's take a look at maybe I've missed some super chats all right let's get back on track here one of the things we talk about here at the rebel is freedom of speech and we talked about how the other day I think yesterday we showed you have something called the Canadians for Canadian journalist for free expression have abandoned their belief in freedom of speech and I'm afraid that the ACLU is backing away from it too and that I find troubling because the ACLU whatever else you think of how left-wing they are they've defended the toughest cases and they make a point they're saying we don't agree with these people they would the tradition was to send a black lawyer or a Jewish lawyer to defend the neo-nazi defendant which was their way of saying obviously we hate this guy's message but we know that we have to defend his freedom of speech they offered or it's ours tomorrow so take a look at the ACLU has to say the ACLU retreats from freedom of expression of free expression this is in The Wall Street Journal the organization declares its speech it doesn't like can inflict serious harms and impede progress by when the kaminer the American Civil Liberties Union has explicitly endorsed the view that free speech can harm marginalized groups by undermining their civil rights quote speech that denigrates at Scripps can inflict serious harms and is intended to and often will impede progress towards equality the ACLU declares in new guidelines governing case selection and conflicts between competing values or priorities and you know what their their right speech can impede other priorities and values absolutely spicy speech controversial speech means speech hateful speech Nazi speech whatever it can impede harmony and happiness and serenity it absolutely can but that's why we call it free speech is that the speech is free from those other priorities and if you're for free speech you're for free speech even though it counters other priorities that's otherwise it's not called free speech freedom of speech means your speech will not be infringed by I mean no one says they want to silence your speech for no reason they always have a reason sometimes the reasons are pretty good but the whole point about freedom of speech is that you saying we value speech so much inherently that it will trump other concerns unless it's so such a staggering concern like the free speech is actually in the form of a credible and imminent death threat the free speech is actually you know an exhortation to commit terrorism so that the essence of the speech is not just free speech in itself but it's actually a murderous threat the terrorist act but it has to be that dramatic simply marginalizing people off speech marginalizes someone if it's political speech the ACLU used to know that free speech is a tool for marginalized people think of Martin Luther King what did he have did he have all the money no did he have all the political power no did he have what did he have he had free speech and an argument it was the great equalizer how about the suffragettes let's go back a hundred years did they have political power no by definition they did not did they have I don't know military power did they have all the dough no I think of Mahatma Gandhi it was the the power of his speech and his actions of course his hunger strikes for example which required a free press to transmit them to the people it was his self-sacrifice and his accompanying free speech that pricked the conscience of the United Kingdom of the British Empire what's the commonality between Mahatma Gandhi and India Martin Luther King the suffragettes I'd throw gay rights in there - well those are those are the marginalised groups who don't have the dough who don't have the political power don't have physical power military power violent power other sources of power corporate power all they have to take on the real power is the power of their ideas communicated through free speech and was their free speech offensive of course by definition it was it was offensive to the order of the day to the status quo in fact let me turn it around on the ACLU marginalized groups offending people if we didn't have free speech every one of those people I just mentioned censorship could have would have should have been used to shut them up was Martin Luther King offensive to plenty of people he was including plenty of people in the establishment if you now say if the ACLU now says that they believe that other values like harmony and not offending and not hurting feelings and not being offensive can trump the inherent and essential value of free speech Martin Luther King would have been jailed the suffragettes would have been jailed I remember I was once arguing with a law student who actually migrated to Canada from a Rwanda and he said he was in a class and the teacher asked who was a Hutu and who was a Tutsi those were two warring factions in Rwanda and he said my experience in Rwanda tells me we need hate speech laws and I thought oh my god do you think that if there were hate speech laws in Rwanda the those laws wouldn't have been used to shut you up I mean if a government is willing to use a gun to murder you you don't think they would use a hate speech law to silence your complaints about it like do you really think that a government imposed censorship isn't used in the interests of the government do you doubt that if there wasn't the First Amendment that some segregationist politician would have used that against Martin Luther King do you doubt if there wasn't a First Amendment some anti suffragette lawmaker a hundred years ago wouldn't have taken action against the suffragettes do you really think that government censorship is only in your hands and I had an interview with Alan Bukhari I don't think we put it online yet and that's the thing is so we were talking about how do you deal with Twitter and Facebook how do you have government regulate them in a way that if the next Barack Obama becomes president you're okay with the tools you've given the power because you know that when you give government censorship power it's not just Donald Trump for Stephen Harper that's going to use those tools it's Justin sexy voice Trudeau and Barack Obama I see a super chat let me just take a look here Keith McIntosh loves super chat concept idea proposed to YouTube to implement some of our idea to allow for tipping for regular videos often a like doesn't do justice for video that's very well done ability to dip ten cents to a dollar would be great that's a good idea I have interacted with YouTube management on three occasions and those three occasions have convinced me that that they don't listen to people they just don't listen and yeah so if you have a suggestion to make to YouTube put it out there I mean I think that's a good idea by the way and they'll take their car believe me I think they take 30 percent of the super chat but yeah I I have no power whatsoever I mean PewDiePie himself the number one subscribed YouTube channel I think they'd ignore him to they just have their own in impenetrable decisions and decision making approaches it's so 51 I think I spent about half an hour today rambling on about Vince Vaughn wedding crashers and probably a misremembered joke about Justin Trudeau but I think I I think it was good to show you the North Korea um clip and the quintuple stumble with David Axelrod there are a couple of super chats that are missing and they go to them now I don't know I just I wanted to I really wanted to make the point the citizen through I just whenever he looks at and Bob's the head I just think I'm not a girl you're trying to unburrow right now Justin you're a grown up now and stop smoking the weed and stop trying to unburrow me and just pretend you're a grown out super-shot same thing one says one up Justin by doing battle ground drunk as what some would say my scattered shows is tantamount to that moon man two dollars if you let other men plow your wife you win Justin well that is very bad that is a very bad thing to say and I'm it's uh first of all I understand you're referring to the apocryphal Justin Trudeau if you let if you kill terrorists you let them win so I know you're not implying that Justin Trudeau allows other men to have their way with his wife I want to clarify I understand your obscure joke and it's not what some people might think it means that said can we have two Lamond Amparo Justin Trudeau and Jian Ghomeshi because what better way to end the show then again a clip so creepy that if this were Donald Trump you would have memorized it by now because you would have seen it 1,000 times the clip I'm about to show you is from a Quebec TV show called to LeMond non-power that means that's French for that everybody's talking the whole world's talking and it's a very high rated show in Quebec and Justin Trudeau went on the show with his lovely wife Sophie and went on with a fella name is Jian Ghomeshi who was a CBC radio host who was later fired for his bizarre fifty shades of gray abusiveness but Fifty Shades of Grey tried to make it look cool and sexy Jian Ghomeshi confessed and it was proven in court he was not convicted of a crime but what came out in court is that he would date women and when they just wouldn't expect it he would choke them or smashed him in the face so hard they're had their ears would ring he was just pure violent it wasn't like a it wasn't even like a BDSM thing it was like oh I've got you in my room now I'm going to literally beat the beat you bloody beat you black and blue and he did this for years so he was a really freaky really freaky freaky Queen you know really freaky creep and he was it was covered up the CBC literally had a war room designed to discredit his accusers do we have that to him on on problem all right look at this what can I say take a look very handsome Thank You Justin I think because the show again show the whole thing in it there's a longer version of that give me five seconds before and five seconds after can we do that so this is Justin Trudeau in the buckskin jacket his wife Sophie and Jian Ghomeshi is the Persian Canadian and and she says kiss him I want to show 5 seconds before cuz I want to show the banter give me ten seconds before it and she says kiss him Sophie Gregoire Trudeau says to her husband kiss is Yan Gomes she and he turns to her and winks and just moves on take a look wait William Shatner jay-z radio and Jane Fonda Paul McCartney a Leonard torn cammies Evy Alice you are not excusing and there was the only one he did in the world and why yeah yeah it was a great very very handsome thank you Justin I think because the show has a reputation I would hope so there we go shreya shaadi he's very you're very handsome so zhanka man she says I was the only one in the world who got an interview with Leonard Cohen and Trudeau says well it's because you're very handsome and Sophie Gregoire Trudeau his wife says kiss him and he just turns her to her and winks at her and goes back to things is that weird yeah it's a little weird don't you think I think it's a little bit weird does it mean anything I have no idea no idea is that underreported yeah have you ever seen that before you ever seen that before can you call up Sheila's video on Sophie Gregoire and the drink you know what I'm talking about I see super chat Keith McIntosh but but you're Ezra Levin what part of that doesn't YouTube listen when I met with YouTube I was complaining about their D monetization of our videos they we literally there's three words that I know if we put it in the headline of a video YouTube refuses to sell ads Trudeau feminism or Isis they just you put we put the word feminist and in a headline they won't they won't put an ad on it these won't it's it's not even a human decision I'm sure it's just an algorithm we can appeal those but it takes 48 hours to appeal and by that time the news is still 99% of the viewers of where I'll forgive for that video ever be gone let me know when we have this video and again what I'm about to show you a video that is gross it's an attempt at humor I acknowledge that someone's trying to be funny not all jokes are front is very hard to be funny I guess what I'm saying to you is if Melania Trump made this video or Stephen Harper's wife Lorene Harper had made this video or Andrew sheers wife I don't remember her name made this video would you have seen it before I'm gonna show you a video from Sophie Gregoire Trudeau from a few years back I'm not sure if they were married then I think they were and it's in French but it doesn't even matter can we play with Sheila did commentary let's skip Sheila's commentary I just want to show the raw stuff itself take a look ahead you don't approve anything well the Fallujah let's go play with a nosotros victor she approached me people have transformed a sectarian feminism our own inexperience sauce well if that cash is all right the phony chefs under NASA Chuy Mata scored you know is an attack prevent speak up sweaty she demanded attention especially little dopamine incidents from Omaha and Alicia shavanasa on returns from me that connection engine 1e Lena so facilities to go hello hello personalist or not so some of the coaches for jihad for me no son mark no de feminine met the ball tonight on a little abou the tape blessed Jessica's a brunette not afraid to test a John we sit the farmer Capone and Rodger Baskerville you know that pay Elmira Salle de Bain Nikki Bella this with Coco hell eliminar 0.08 sit home voila the to Ridgeway stay quiet may come as a function over John that's a good its lead look too well they're not in rusty the club events come to see this Thomas today it's not but I've seen I've seen enough it's so gross we did a video on this Sheila gonna redo the video it goes on and let me tell you it gets grosser now do I know that this is a joke yes I know it's a joke or an attempt at a joke do I think this is real no I don't think this is real it goes on and on and on and on and on you can find it on our website do I think do I think that you're not allowed to make gross jokes no I think you should be able to make gross jokes was that to Lamont amparo kiss him business real I don't know probably a joke my point is this and it goes to the Trump derangement syndrome we talked about earlier with pets so if Melania Trump had done that if Trump and Melania had had that kissing moment thing do you think you would have seen that a hundred thousand times by now I think you would and I think that goes to the fact that the media party you just can't trust a word they say alright that's the strangest and weirdest battleground we've ever done a little bit rambling and I misremembered the wedding crashers I haven't seen that movie in 15 20 years so forgive me I gave you instead a lot of justin trudeau weirdness cuz you know you're not gonna get it on the CBC the state broadcaster I see it's 101 we're a little bit over time on behalf of all of us here rebel world headquarters until tomorrow good night and keep fighting for freedom you
