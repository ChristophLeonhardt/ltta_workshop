hey-ho let's go and that's me
multitasking both giving her a nice warm
greeting for the beginning of this video
whilst also boasting the full extent of
my knowledge of the remains
I do love my iPhone for me it's a
lifestyle product some of you may
remember the video I did a couple of
years ago about ambience which is an
iPhone app that allows you to listen to
interesting sounds as you drift off to
sleep including that of a dog eating a
biscuit because we all need that in our
lives right especially we don't have a
dog well in that video I mentioned the
time I was caught sleep talking and ever
since I've been curious to know what do
I sound like when I sleep talk sleep
talk recorder should do the trick this
app is so simple you basically click the
bed icon before you go to sleep and put
it on the side of your bed with the
microphone facing you and then when you
wake up it'll give you a list of all the
time sound was picked up and you can
listen through them favorite them upload
them etc and the results have been quite
freaky to say the least
there was actually one sound in
particular that really made me cringe
which was this one
that my friends is the sound of me
grinding my teeth whilst wearing a mouth
guard and now I don't wear it because I
was dreaming of playing American
football handegg just stress but most of
the recordings have been very funny
anything from me saying yes to sleep
lulling right and even reciting the
Lord's Prayer the kingdom come and
before that I hadn't even said the
Lord's press it's like primary school so
I thought we can make a game out of this
the rules are simple
I play you a series of recordings and
you put in the comments below your
interpretations number one seems to be
maybe a lot closer than it is now number
two I was doing I'm bucket of poo number
three number four second they're all
both against him no but they're all the
same thing throw things your help
they handstand number five yeah I think
do it you know must talk with them in
number six though they are HOF
number seven anyone was ever getting
anything at number eight you hold ok ok
bonus one you ready for this ok here we
go
you know yes you know you stupid stupid
oh ok that last one wasn't real ok the
others were but that wasn't I was just
yanking your chain
what no no I didn't mean your bike is
it's a metaphor I picked up when I was
in the US off the ground no picked up as
in I'd learnt it up forget it there is
no right or wrong in this quiz just most
likely and least likely answers but I am
looking forward to hearing you
and if you want to be creepy and listen
to all future recordings of me
sleep-talking
the link is in the description to this
video so have a good one and a Dios til
next just one second
hello what you can't be serious
Nicki Minaj wants to do what with me
