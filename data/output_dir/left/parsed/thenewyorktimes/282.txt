Hi, I’m Ava DuVernay,
the director
of “A Wrinkle in Time."
So at this point in
“A Wrinkle in Time,"
this is Meg’s first world.
So she’s just hopped
to her first planet.
And one of the reasons why I
really wanted to do this movie
was just the very
image of a girl
of color traversing
through the universe,
having these adventures.
In this moment Meg Murry — 
played by my great leading lady
Storm Reid —
she’s being asked
to talk to flowers.
Because everyone knows that
flowers are the best gossipers
in the universe.
And one of the things
about the design of this
is I wanted it to feel
like our characters were
in a world that was somewhat
real, but somewhat animated.
So I wanted to make sure
that it wasn’t hyper-real.
We’re not trying to make
everything look real.
We like the fact
that the flowers have
a bit of a cartoon quality.
I always wanted to
step inside a cartoon.
So this is basically Meg
stepping inside of it.
Here Mrs. Whatsit — played
by Reese Witherspoon —
turns into creature Whatsit.
And this is a big
change from the book.
In the book creature
Whatsit is a centaur —
half woman, half horse.
What we wanted to do is update
Madeleine L’Engle’s beautiful
work in “A Wrinkle in
Time” — the author —
and create something that
hadn’t been seen before.
Because we’ve seen
centaurs on screen.
So we created this
beautiful leaf-like creature
who pulls from the environment.
And creature Whatsit
it now looks like this.
And this quote by Mrs. Who — 
played by Mindy Kaling —
Dang.
And observed by
Oprah Winfrey as Mrs.
Which — is another update
to Madeline L’Engle’s work
to create a new vision
of “A Wrinkle in Time."
Oh.
Woo-hoo.
