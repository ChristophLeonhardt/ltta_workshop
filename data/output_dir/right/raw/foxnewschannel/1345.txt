1
00:00:01,474 --> 00:00:04,210
ABC AFTER LEAD ACTOR MADE

2
00:00:04,210 --> 00:00:06,179
SOME REMARKS ON TWITTER THAT

3
00:00:06,179 --> 00:00:06,980
SHE REGRETTED.

4
00:00:06,980 --> 00:00:08,448
FOR NOW OUR EYES ARE ON THE

5
00:00:08,448 --> 00:00:09,849
PRESIDENT WHO HAS ENJOYED

6
00:00:09,849 --> 00:00:12,052
RISING APPROVAL RATINGS AND

7
00:00:12,052 --> 00:00:15,388
INTERVENING MORE AND

8
00:00:15,388 --> 00:00:16,856
EARIVELY BEFORE MIDTERM

9
00:00:16,856 --> 00:00:18,024
ELECTIONS.

10
00:00:18,024 --> 00:00:19,726
MID TERMS TYPICALLY GO BADLY

11
00:00:19,726 --> 00:00:23,997
FOR THE INCUMBENT PARTY:  WE

12
00:00:23,997 --> 00:00:26,833
ARE JOINT TONIGHT BY SENIOR

13
00:00:26,833 --> 00:00:29,770
POLITICAL ANALYST BRIT HUME.

14
00:00:29,770 --> 00:00:30,704
WOULD THESE HELP THE

15
00:00:30,704 --> 00:00:31,071
CANDIDATE.

16
00:00:31,071 --> 00:00:33,340
>> THE CANDIDATE WHO IS.

17
00:00:33,340 --> 00:00:34,174
>> Tucker: FOR WHOM THE

18
00:00:34,174 --> 00:00:35,008
PRESIDENT IS STUMPING.

19
00:00:35,008 --> 00:00:36,677
>> I THINK IN THIS CASE.

20
00:00:36,677 --> 00:00:37,611
THE STATE OF TENNESSEE IS A

21
00:00:37,611 --> 00:00:38,578
STATE THAT THE PRESIDENT

22
00:00:38,578 --> 00:00:39,146
CARRIED EASILY.

23
00:00:39,146 --> 00:00:41,481
THERE IS A REASONABLY

24
00:00:41,481 --> 00:00:42,182
POPULAR CANDIDATE ON THE

25
00:00:42,182 --> 00:00:44,551
OTHER SIDE PHIL BRED SON WHO

26
00:00:44,551 --> 00:00:47,054
WAS GOVERNOR AND HAS BEEN

27
00:00:47,054 --> 00:00:47,821
WELL-REGARDED IN THE STATE.

28
00:00:47,821 --> 00:00:49,523
HE IS AHEAD IN WHAT FEW

29
00:00:49,523 --> 00:00:50,357
POLLS THERE ARE.

30
00:00:50,357 --> 00:00:52,626
SO, BUT MARSHA BLACKBURN HAS

31
00:00:52,626 --> 00:00:53,494
A REAL CHANCE TO TAKE THE

32
00:00:53,494 --> 00:00:58,132
SEAT FOR THE REPUBLICANS AND

33
00:00:58,132 --> 00:01:00,167
SHE WILL NEED THE SUPPORT OF

34
00:01:00,167 --> 00:01:01,068
THE TRUMP.

35
00:01:01,068 --> 00:01:02,136
SHE WILL CERTAINLY NEED THAT

36
00:01:02,136 --> 00:01:03,404
AND HIS BEING THERE HELPS

37
00:01:03,404 --> 00:01:04,538
WITH THAT OTHER THING ABOUT

38
00:01:04,538 --> 00:01:08,742
IT OF COURSE IS HE LOVES

39
00:01:08,742 --> 00:01:09,109
THIS.

40
00:01:09,109 --> 00:01:10,244
>> Tucker: HE DOES LOVE IT.

41
00:01:10,244 --> 00:01:11,378
NO DOUBT ABOUT THAT.

42
00:01:11,378 --> 00:01:13,114
>> IN WASHINGTON HE FEELS

43
00:01:13,114 --> 00:01:14,715
COOPSD UP AND CRITICIZED AND

44
00:01:14,715 --> 00:01:16,250
KIND OF LIKE A MAN ON AN

45
00:01:16,250 --> 00:01:17,318
ISLAND AND HE GETS OUT TO

46
00:01:17,318 --> 00:01:19,120
THESE RALLIES WHERE HE PACKS

47
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:20,888
THESE HUGE HOUSES AND ALL

48
00:01:20,888 --> 00:01:21,722
FULLY ADVANCED BY HIS TEAM

49
00:01:21,722 --> 00:01:23,224
AND PEOPLE COME AND CHEER

50
00:01:23,224 --> 00:01:24,625
WILDLY FOR HIM AND IT MAKES

51
00:01:24,625 --> 00:01:27,795
HIM FEEL GOOD BILL CLINTON

52
00:01:27,795 --> 00:01:28,830
WAS THE SAME WAY.

53
00:01:28,830 --> 00:01:29,931
HE GOT ENERGY FROM IT.

54
00:01:29,931 --> 00:01:31,265
PEOPLE WHO COVERED HIM ON

55
00:01:31,265 --> 00:01:32,100
HIS CAMPAIGN, WHICH I

56
00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:33,267
COVERED HIM AS PRESIDENT BUT

57
00:01:33,267 --> 00:01:34,769
NOT ON THE CAMPAIGN WOULD

58
00:01:34,769 --> 00:01:35,536
SAY AT THE END OF THE DAY,

59
00:01:35,536 --> 00:01:36,471
EVERYONE WOULD BE EXHAUSTED

60
00:01:36,471 --> 00:01:39,007
AND HE SEEMED TO BE SOME

61
00:01:39,007 --> 00:01:40,742
RALLY AND PEOPLE CHEERING

62
00:01:40,742 --> 00:01:42,143
LIKE MAD AND HE WAS FULL CRY

63
00:01:42,143 --> 00:01:43,878
AND ROARING WITH ENERGY AND

64
00:01:43,878 --> 00:01:45,013
COULDN’T GET ENOUGH OF IT

65
00:01:45,013 --> 00:01:47,248
TRUMP SEEMS MUCH THE SAME

66
00:01:47,248 --> 00:01:47,582
WAY.

67
00:01:47,582 --> 00:01:48,416
>> Tucker: THE DEBATE OVER

68
00:01:48,416 --> 00:01:49,217
WHOSE PARTY IS THE

69
00:01:49,217 --> 00:01:50,618
REPUBLICAN PARTY IT’S

70
00:01:50,618 --> 00:01:51,085
TRUMP’S PARTY.

71
00:01:51,085 --> 00:01:51,920
>> IT IS.

72
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:53,321
BUT CONSIDER -- I THINK IT’S

73
00:01:53,321 --> 00:01:54,889
ALSO FAIR TO SAY, TUCKER,

74
00:01:54,889 --> 00:01:56,124
FOR ALL THE TALK ABOUT HOW

75
00:01:56,124 --> 00:01:57,058
THE PARTY HAS BEEN

76
00:01:57,058 --> 00:01:58,193
COMPLETELY TAKEN OVER BY

77
00:01:58,193 --> 00:02:00,562
TRUMP AND THE -- AND IT WILL

78
00:02:00,562 --> 00:02:02,397
NOT -- IT WILL BE HIS PARTY

79
00:02:02,397 --> 00:02:04,099
IN PERPETUITY, I THINK THE

80
00:02:04,099 --> 00:02:07,002
REPUBLICAN PARTY AND ITS

81
00:02:07,135 --> 00:02:08,303
INFLUENCE ON HIM THAN HE HAS

82
00:02:08,303 --> 00:02:09,638
HAD ON THEM.

83
00:02:09,638 --> 00:02:10,271
>> Tucker: WHY DO YOU SAY

84
00:02:10,271 --> 00:02:10,572
THAT?

85
00:02:10,572 --> 00:02:11,473
>> BECAUSE YOU LOOK AT THE

86
00:02:11,473 --> 00:02:13,241
ISSUES, RIGHT?

87
00:02:13,241 --> 00:02:13,542
TAXES.

88
00:02:13,542 --> 00:02:14,676
HE TALKED ABOUT THAT.

89
00:02:14,676 --> 00:02:17,245
THAT’S A CENTRAL REPUBLICAN

90
00:02:17,245 --> 00:02:17,712
TENET.

91
00:02:17,712 --> 00:02:19,815
STRONGER DEFENSE, ALSO,

92
00:02:19,815 --> 00:02:21,650
LIKEWISE A CENTRAL REPUCK

93
00:02:21,650 --> 00:02:25,921
REPUBLICAN TENET.

94
00:02:25,921 --> 00:02:29,057
DEREGULATION, THAT’S A BEEN

95
00:02:29,057 --> 00:02:31,894
A REPUBLICAN RED LETTER

96
00:02:31,894 --> 00:02:32,861
ISSUE FOREVER.

97
00:02:32,861 --> 00:02:34,163
ONLY ISSUES WHICH HE HAS

98
00:02:34,163 --> 00:02:35,230
DEPARTED ARE IMMIGRATION AND

99
00:02:35,230 --> 00:02:35,531
TRADE.

100
00:02:35,531 --> 00:02:36,966
IT’S NOT AT ALL CLEAR WHEN

101
00:02:36,966 --> 00:02:40,569
ALL IS SAID AND DONE WHETHER

102
00:02:40,569 --> 00:02:42,104
WHAT COMES OUT OF ALL OF

103
00:02:42,104 --> 00:02:44,273
THIS THE POLICIES THAT

104
00:02:44,273 --> 00:02:45,441
EMERGE ARE OBJECTIONABLE TO

105
00:02:45,441 --> 00:02:47,042
THE REPUBLICAN MAINSTREAM.

106
00:02:47,042 --> 00:02:48,043
>> Tucker: IF THERE WERE A

107
00:02:48,043 --> 00:02:49,245
THIRD PARTY CHALLENGE.

108
00:02:49,245 --> 00:02:50,679
WHAT WOULD THE THIRD PARTY

109
00:02:50,679 --> 00:02:51,847
CHALLENGER RUN ON EXACTLY.

110
00:02:51,847 --> 00:02:54,049
>> WELL A THIRD PARTY

111
00:02:54,049 --> 00:03:02,959
CHALLENGE TO TRUMP OR A

112
00:03:02,959 --> 00:03:03,392
CANDIDATE?

113
00:03:03,392 --> 00:03:03,960
>> Tucker: CANDIDATE.

114
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:04,860
>> IT WOULD HAVE TO BE ON

115
00:03:04,860 --> 00:03:06,062
THE ISSUE OF PERSONAL

116
00:03:06,062 --> 00:03:06,429
CHARACTER.

117
00:03:06,429 --> 00:03:09,365
PEOPLE WOULD SAY, YOU KNOW,

118
00:03:09,365 --> 00:03:11,367
WHICH IS THE ISSUE THAT GOT

119
00:03:11,367 --> 00:03:12,668
GEORGE W. BUSH ELECTED BUT

120
00:03:12,668 --> 00:03:13,836
NOT NECESSARILY WITHIN THE

121
00:03:13,836 --> 00:03:16,305
REPUBLICAN RANKS.

122
00:03:16,305 --> 00:03:18,241
WHITE HOUSE, OF COURSE IN

123
00:03:18,241 --> 00:03:19,676
THE AFTERMATH OF THE CLINTON

124
00:03:19,676 --> 00:03:20,610
SCANDALS THAT CARRIED WEIGHT

125
00:03:20,610 --> 00:03:22,078
AND DAMAGING TO AL GORE WHO

126
00:03:22,078 --> 00:03:23,446
HAD TO FIGHT -- HE HAD TO

127
00:03:23,446 --> 00:03:24,480
MAKE THE DECISION HOW

128
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:26,082
CLOSELY TO LINK HIMSELF TO

129
00:03:26,082 --> 00:03:30,420
CLINTON AND THE ROBUST

130
00:03:30,420 --> 00:03:31,454
ECONOMY AND WAS ARGUED

131
00:03:31,454 --> 00:03:32,288
FOREVER THAT HE DIDN’T DO

132
00:03:32,288 --> 00:03:34,924
THAT ENOUGH OR HE DID IT TOO

133
00:03:34,924 --> 00:03:35,225
MUCH.

134
00:03:35,225 --> 00:03:37,427
THAT WAS A BURDEN ON HIM FOR

135
00:03:37,427 --> 00:03:38,762
SURE.

136
00:03:38,762 --> 00:03:41,731
AND BUSH CAPITALIZED ON IT.

137
00:03:41,731 --> 00:03:43,733
WHETHER THAT WILL WORK IN A

138
00:03:43,733 --> 00:03:45,735
REPUBLICAN PRIMARY AT THIS

139
00:03:45,735 --> 00:03:46,336
STAGE I DON’T THINK SO.

140
00:03:46,336 --> 00:03:47,838
I THINK TRUMP HAS TAKEN OVER

141
00:03:47,838 --> 00:03:48,705
MOST OF THE REPUBLICAN

142
00:03:48,705 --> 00:03:50,173
AGENDA.

143
00:03:50,173 --> 00:03:50,841
>> Tucker: SO ON THE ISSUES,

144
00:03:50,841 --> 00:03:52,008
YOU DON’T SEE ANY KIND OF

145
00:03:52,008 --> 00:03:52,876
CHALLENGE FOR THE

146
00:03:52,876 --> 00:03:53,276
NOMINATION?

147
00:03:53,276 --> 00:03:57,080
>> WELL, PEOPLE.

148
00:03:57,080 --> 00:03:57,748
I DON’T THINK ANYONE CAN

149
00:03:57,748 --> 00:03:58,582
CHALLENGE HIM FROM THE LEFT

150
00:03:58,582 --> 00:03:59,516
ON IMMIGRATION OR

151
00:03:59,516 --> 00:04:01,084
PARTICULARLY ON TRADE.

152
00:04:01,084 --> 00:04:02,252
ALTHOUGH ONE OF THE PROBLEMS

153
00:04:02,252 --> 00:04:04,454
WITH TRUMP’S TRADE AGENDA IS

154
00:04:04,454 --> 00:04:05,389
THAT IT COULD GO WRONG.

155
00:04:05,389 --> 00:04:06,823
AND WE COULD END UP, YOU

156
00:04:06,823 --> 00:04:08,158
KNOW, WITH TRADE BARRIERS

157
00:04:08,158 --> 00:04:08,459
UP.

158
00:04:08,459 --> 00:04:11,662
WE HAVE SORT OF BACKED INTO

159
00:04:11,662 --> 00:04:17,001
OR, YOU KNOW, SORT OF

160
00:04:17,134 --> 00:04:18,369
AND THE ECONOMY COULD GET

161
00:04:18,369 --> 00:04:20,237
HURT BY THAT.

162
00:04:20,237 --> 00:04:21,404
AND, YOU KNOW, YOU COULD

163
00:04:21,404 --> 00:04:22,306
HAVE SOMEBODY RUNNING

164
00:04:22,306 --> 00:04:23,140
AGAINST HIM ON THE ECONOMY.

165
00:04:23,140 --> 00:04:24,408
BUT THE ECONOMY WOULD HAVE

166
00:04:24,408 --> 00:04:26,143
TO GO PRETTY FAR SOUTH FROM

167
00:04:26,143 --> 00:04:29,046
WHERE IT IS NOW FOR THAT TO

168
00:04:29,046 --> 00:04:29,380
HAPPEN.

169
00:04:29,380 --> 00:04:31,549
>> HOW BOOYED DO YOU THINK

170
00:04:31,549 --> 00:04:32,950
TRUMP IS REPUBLICANS ARE BY

171
00:04:32,950 --> 00:04:34,418
THE POTENTIAL NORTH KOREAN

172
00:04:34,418 --> 00:04:34,719
DEAL?

173
00:04:34,719 --> 00:04:38,422
>> WELL, I THINK TRUMP WAS

174
00:04:38,422 --> 00:04:39,991
PRETTY EXCITED ABOUT IT,

175
00:04:39,991 --> 00:04:41,859
ABOUT THE POTENTIAL OF IT I

176
00:04:41,859 --> 00:04:43,160
WILL SAY THIS.

177
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:45,997
MY CONCERN HAS BEEN AND IS

178
00:04:45,997 --> 00:04:50,535
NOW THAT HE GETS INTO THE

179
00:04:50,535 --> 00:04:51,335
SUMMIT AND THE POSSIBILITY

180
00:04:51,335 --> 00:04:52,870
OF A DEAL THAT WOULD

181
00:04:52,870 --> 00:04:54,105
DENUCLEARIZE IT AND END THE

182
00:04:54,105 --> 00:04:55,006
KOREAN WAR AND THE REST OF

183
00:04:55,006 --> 00:04:56,641
IT THAT HE MAKES A BAD DEAL.

184
00:04:56,641 --> 00:04:59,043
THAT HE GETS EUCHRED WHICH

185
00:04:59,043 --> 00:05:01,145
IS WHAT HAS HAPPENED BEFORE

186
00:05:01,145 --> 00:05:01,546
REPEATEDLY.

187
00:05:01,546 --> 00:05:02,680
SO FAR THOUGH, IT SEEMS TO

188
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:04,282
ME THAT DESPITE HIS EXCITED

189
00:05:04,282 --> 00:05:05,683
TALK AND HIS BUYING IN AT

190
00:05:05,683 --> 00:05:07,685
LEAST A LITTLE BIT TO THE

191
00:05:07,685 --> 00:05:08,853
NOBEL PRIZE TALK, HIS

192
00:05:08,853 --> 00:05:09,888
WILLINGNESS TO SAY OKAY,

193
00:05:09,888 --> 00:05:11,656
THIS IS OFF SUGGESTS TO ME

194
00:05:11,656 --> 00:05:13,658
THAT, YOU KNOW, HE HAS HIS

195
00:05:13,658 --> 00:05:14,626
EYES WIDE OPEN AND THE

196
00:05:14,626 --> 00:05:16,061
PEOPLE AROUND HIM DO, TOO.

197
00:05:16,061 --> 00:05:17,929
IF HE GETS OVER THERE OR IF

198
00:05:17,929 --> 00:05:18,997
THEY TRY TO ORGANIZE THIS

199
00:05:18,997 --> 00:05:20,365
THING AND IT’S COMING TO PUT

200
00:05:20,365 --> 00:05:21,866
THAT, THAT HE IS WILLING TO

201
00:05:21,866 --> 00:05:22,867
WALK AWAY.

202
00:05:22,867 --> 00:05:24,269
BUT IF HE DIDN’T DO THAT.

203
00:05:24,269 --> 00:05:25,904
AND HE GOT INTO A BAD DEAL,

204
00:05:25,904 --> 00:05:30,242
THAT MIGHT LEAVE

205
00:05:30,242 --> 00:05:31,209
VULNERABILITY.

206
00:05:31,209 --> 00:05:32,177
>> YOU POINTING IN THE RIGHT

207
00:05:32,177 --> 00:05:33,111
DIRECTION FOR REPUBLICANS,

208
00:05:33,111 --> 00:05:33,678
FOR THE WHITE HOUSE.

209
00:05:33,678 --> 00:05:35,781
>> THEY CERTAINLY LOOK A LOT

210
00:05:35,781 --> 00:05:37,115
BETTER THAN THEY DID SIX

211
00:05:37,115 --> 00:05:38,250
MONTHS AGO.

212
00:05:38,250 --> 00:05:39,451
>> Tucker: MUCH BETTER.

213
00:05:39,451 --> 00:05:40,385
WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IF

214
00:05:40,385 --> 00:05:41,753
DEMOCRATS FAILED TO RETAKE

215
00:05:41,753 --> 00:05:42,187
THE HOUSE OF

216
00:05:42,187 --> 00:05:42,654
REPRESENTATIVES?

217
00:05:42,654 --> 00:05:44,056
WHAT WOULD THE RECKONING BE

218
00:05:44,056 --> 00:05:45,057
LIKE DO YOU THINK WITHIN THE

219
00:05:45,057 --> 00:05:45,557
DEMOCRATIC PARTY?

220
00:05:45,557 --> 00:05:47,159
>> IT WOULD BE PRETTY

221
00:05:47,159 --> 00:05:47,693
SERIOUS.

222
00:05:47,693 --> 00:05:49,595
I THINK THE MESSAGE THAT

223
00:05:49,595 --> 00:05:50,429
WOULD PROBABLY COME OUT OF

224
00:05:50,429 --> 00:05:51,964
THAT WOULD BE THAT BEING,

225
00:05:51,964 --> 00:05:53,966
YOU KNOW, JUST

226
00:05:53,966 --> 00:05:54,767
OVERWHELMINGLY ANTI-TRUMP IS

227
00:05:54,767 --> 00:05:56,268
NOT ENOUGH.

228
00:05:56,268 --> 00:05:58,170
THAT WHILE THAT AWAKENS THE

229
00:05:58,170 --> 00:06:00,105
SENTIMENTS IN THE BASE AND

230
00:06:00,105 --> 00:06:01,140
RESPONSIBLE FOR A LOT OF THE

231
00:06:01,140 --> 00:06:02,107
ENERGY IN THE DEMOCRATIC

232
00:06:02,107 --> 00:06:03,509
PARTY THESE DAYS, THAT THAT

233
00:06:03,509 --> 00:06:04,810
IN ITSELF IS NOT ENOUGH.

234
00:06:04,810 --> 00:06:05,978
IT’S TOO NEGATIVE.

235
00:06:05,978 --> 00:06:06,846
DOESN’T PAINT A PICTURE OF

236
00:06:06,846 --> 00:06:08,080
HOW MUCH BETTER THINGS COULD

237
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:10,082
BE.

238
00:06:10,082 --> 00:06:12,651
IT DOESN’T REALLY AROUSE

239
00:06:12,651 --> 00:06:13,652
PEOPLE -- MOST PEOPLE ARE

240
00:06:13,652 --> 00:06:14,787
NOT PASSIONATE ONE WAY OR

241
00:06:14,787 --> 00:06:15,721
THE OTHER.

242
00:06:15,721 --> 00:06:16,756
MOST PEOPLE WILLING TO VOTE

243
00:06:16,756 --> 00:06:18,190
ON A MIDTERM WANT TO HEAR

244
00:06:18,190 --> 00:06:19,225
FROM SOMEBODY WHO SAYS,

245
00:06:19,225 --> 00:06:20,259
LOOK, I CAN MAKE THINGS

246
00:06:20,259 --> 00:06:21,861
BETTER FOR YOU AND HERE IS

247
00:06:21,861 --> 00:06:22,929
HOW.

248
00:06:22,929 --> 00:06:23,829
AND IF YOU HAVEN’T GOT THAT

249
00:06:23,829 --> 00:06:26,232
IN A WAY THAT AND IF YOU RUN

250
00:06:26,232 --> 00:06:27,400
AS A DEMOCRAT, SOME

251
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:28,768
DEMOCRATS SEEM PREPARED TO

252
00:06:28,768 --> 00:06:29,068
DO IT.

253
00:06:29,068 --> 00:06:30,303
VOTE FOR ME, I WILL RAISE

254
00:06:30,303 --> 00:06:31,137
YOUR TAXES.

255
00:06:31,137 --> 00:06:32,071
THAT’S PROBABLY NOT GOING TO

256
00:06:32,071 --> 00:06:34,273
WORK EITHER.

257
00:06:34,273 --> 00:06:36,109
>> Tucker: DO YOU SEE ANY

258
00:06:36,109 --> 00:06:37,110
STIRRINGS IN THE DEMOCRATIC

259
00:06:37,110 --> 00:06:38,411
PARTY WHICH IS REALIGNS AGO

260
00:06:38,411 --> 00:06:39,779
I THINK THE REPUBLICAN PARTY

261
00:06:39,779 --> 00:06:41,547
IS THOUGH IT GETS LITTLE

262
00:06:41,547 --> 00:06:41,915
COVERAGE.

263
00:06:41,915 --> 00:06:45,351
ANY STIRRINGS OF A POSITIVE

264
00:06:45,351 --> 00:06:45,685
AGENDA.

265
00:06:45,685 --> 00:06:46,619
WE ARE AGAINST TRUMP OF

266
00:06:46,619 --> 00:06:47,587
COURSE WE ARE BUT HERE IS

267
00:06:47,587 --> 00:06:48,888
WHAT WE ARE FOVMENT DO YOU

268
00:06:48,888 --> 00:06:50,056
SEE ANYTHING ALONG THOSE

269
00:06:50,056 --> 00:06:50,356
LINES.

270
00:06:50,356 --> 00:06:50,990
>> GROW.

271
00:06:50,990 --> 00:06:52,292
I’M NOT SURE HOW WE WOULD

272
00:06:52,292 --> 00:06:52,592
KNOW.

273
00:06:52,592 --> 00:06:53,793
THE TRUTH IS WHEN YOU GET

274
00:06:53,793 --> 00:06:55,261
DOWN TO IT, TUCKER, THERE

275
00:06:55,261 --> 00:06:57,397
ARE NOT A LOT OF NEW IDEAS.

276
00:06:57,397 --> 00:06:58,698
YOU ARE USUALLY FOR REIGNING

277
00:06:58,698 --> 00:07:00,667
IN GOVERNMENT.

278
00:07:00,667 --> 00:07:01,601
CONTROLLING SPENDING

279
00:07:01,601 --> 00:07:02,435
ALTHOUGH REPUBLICANS HAVE

280
00:07:02,435 --> 00:07:03,803
KIND OF GIVEN UP ON THAT.

281
00:07:03,803 --> 00:07:05,505
AND AT LEAST IN RECENT

282
00:07:05,505 --> 00:07:05,806
TIMES.

283
00:07:05,806 --> 00:07:07,574
LOWER TAXES.

284
00:07:07,574 --> 00:07:09,876
STERNER DEFENSE.

285
00:07:09,876 --> 00:07:10,811
TOUGHER FOREIGN POLICY.

286
00:07:10,811 --> 00:07:11,845
ALL OF THAT RIGHT?

287
00:07:11,845 --> 00:07:12,646
SOFT REGULATION.

288
00:07:12,646 --> 00:07:13,613
DEMOCRATS ARE FOR THE

289
00:07:13,613 --> 00:07:14,281
OPPOSITE THINGS.

290
00:07:14,281 --> 00:07:15,449
AND THEY ALWAYS WILL BE.

291
00:07:15,449 --> 00:07:16,650
THAT’S WHAT THEY ARE ABOUT.

292
00:07:16,650 --> 00:07:18,185
YOU KNOW, SO YOU CAN RUN ON

293
00:07:18,185 --> 00:07:19,486
A PLATFORM THAT SAYS LOOK,

294
00:07:19,486 --> 00:07:20,754
YOU KNOW, TRUMP IS

295
00:07:20,754 --> 00:07:22,022
DESTROYING THE ENVIRONMENT.

296
00:07:22,022 --> 00:07:24,625
IS HE LETTING THE CORPORATE

297
00:07:24,625 --> 00:07:25,792
MOGULS RUN AMUCK AND BIG

298
00:07:25,792 --> 00:07:26,860
BANKS ARE CASHING IN AS

299
00:07:26,860 --> 00:07:27,494
NEVER BEFORE.

300
00:07:27,494 --> 00:07:28,996
WE HAVE GOT TO PUT A STOP TO

301
00:07:28,996 --> 00:07:29,296
THIS.

302
00:07:29,296 --> 00:07:31,065
THAT WILL ATTRACT SOME

303
00:07:31,065 --> 00:07:31,432
SUPPORT.

304
00:07:31,432 --> 00:07:32,533
THAT SEEMS PRETTY TIRED

305
00:07:32,533 --> 00:00:00,000
RIGHT NOW.
