So you've arrived in Myanmar and
managed to convert your cash
to kyat, the local currency.
But what do you do if you don't want
to carry huge stacks of dirty bills?
>> It's already closed.
It's already closed.
>> After years of reporting for the
country, I've got a little secret.
I like to come right here, just off
Merchant Street in Yangon, where for
a price you can replace torn,
stained kyat notes with fresh,
clean bills.
>> Where are the,
you have new notes?
>> 
>> Yeah.
>> Are they videotaping?
>> Oh.
They don't want that camera.
>> Oh, I forgot to add.
I'm not sure this is entirely legal.
Technically, money
exchanges need to be done
at government approved
money changers.
Zaw Lin!
Can you come here?
I can't speak .
>> He often comes here
to exchange money.
>> Yes it's true.
>> You want to take 500 bills?
>> They are taking photos.
>> No, they are just taking
photos of his dollars.
>> No, no 5,000, understand?
>> I think he is saying 1000 bills.
>> You mean like this?
No.
>> 
>> This one.
Yeah?
>> Oh, you mean 5,000 bills.
>> No.
>> We don't have them.
>> Maybe.
Okay.
500 okay?
500?
>> It might be a little sketchy, but
I get what I came for in no time.
