1
00:00:17,133 --> 00:00:20,213
They are called primitive dogs
because they haven't been

2
00:00:20,213 --> 00:00:22,533
changed or touched by man.

3
00:00:22,533 --> 00:00:25,833
This is how they were 3,500 years ago

4
00:00:25,833 --> 00:00:28,453
and you can see them in the
Peruvian pottery.

5
00:00:28,453 --> 00:00:32,052
These dogs, not long ago,
have been declared

6
00:00:32,052 --> 00:00:33,643
national patrimony.

7
00:00:33,643 --> 00:00:36,813
They are as important as Machu Picchu.

8
00:00:37,933 --> 00:00:43,633
I always say that these dogs are
really a living treasure.

9
00:00:43,633 --> 00:00:48,243
And, they have passed all the
difficulties and lived until today

10
00:00:48,243 --> 00:00:00,000
loving the human being.
