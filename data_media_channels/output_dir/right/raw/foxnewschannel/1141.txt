1
00:00:00,982 --> 00:00:02,383
ELSE TO EXPLAIN BECAUSE GENNIFER

2
00:00:02,383 --> 00:00:03,284
FLOWERS HAS A SHOCKING

3
00:00:03,284 --> 00:00:06,087
REVELATION AND IT JOINS US NOW

4
00:00:06,087 --> 00:00:07,421
FOR AN EXCLUSIVE INTERVIEW.

5
00:00:07,421 --> 00:00:09,023
HER FIRST IN SIX YEARS.

6
00:00:09,023 --> 00:00:11,292
JENNIFER, IT'S GREAT TO SEE YOU.

7
00:00:11,292 --> 00:00:13,961
I KNOW THIS MUST HAVE BEEN WILD

8
00:00:13,961 --> 00:00:14,662
FOR YOU TO WATCH THIS OVER THE

9
00:00:14,662 --> 00:00:20,401
LAST FEW DAYS, ALL OVER AGAIN.

10
00:00:20,401 --> 00:00:21,135
FIRST, YOUR INITIAL REACTION TO

11
00:00:21,135 --> 00:00:23,371
WATCHING HIM.

12
00:00:23,371 --> 00:00:25,206
HE CLEARLY HAD THE BODY

13
00:00:25,206 --> 00:00:27,608
LANGUAGE, ARMS CROSSED, AND HE

14
00:00:27,608 --> 00:00:29,176
WAS VERY ANGRY THAT THIS

15
00:00:29,176 --> 00:00:32,445
REPORTER ASKED HIM KIND OF SOME

16
00:00:32,445 --> 00:00:34,715
FAIRLY LOGICAL QUESTIONS I WOULD

17
00:00:34,715 --> 00:00:36,918
IMAGINE.

18
00:00:36,918 --> 00:00:37,785
>> RIGHT.

19
00:00:37,785 --> 00:00:39,186
WHILE MY FIRST IMPRESSION WAS HE

20
00:00:39,186 --> 00:00:40,988
IS NOT AS GOOD OF A LIAR AS HE

21
00:00:40,988 --> 00:00:43,758
IS TO BE, OR NOT ON HIS GAME

22
00:00:43,758 --> 00:00:46,627
WHERE THAT IS CONCERNED.

23
00:00:46,627 --> 00:00:48,763
AND I AM ADVOCATING THAT BILL BE

24
00:00:48,763 --> 00:00:50,197
PROSECUTED FOR HIS SEX CRIMES

25
00:00:50,197 --> 00:00:51,365
JUST LIKE HARVEY WEINSTEIN HAS

26
00:00:51,365 --> 00:00:53,968
BEEN ARRESTED AND BILL COSBY IS

27
00:00:53,968 --> 00:00:55,770
ABOUT TO BE SENTENCED.

28
00:00:55,770 --> 00:00:57,772
WHY NOT A BILL CLINTON?

29
00:00:57,772 --> 00:00:58,205
HE'S NERVOUS.

30
00:00:58,205 --> 00:00:59,740
THAT'S WHY HE IS ACTING THAT

31
00:00:59,740 --> 00:01:02,510
WAY, AND PROBABLY HAS SOME

32
00:01:02,510 --> 00:01:04,010
HEALTH PROBLEMS AND IT HAS

33
00:01:04,010 --> 00:01:09,383
AFFECTED HIS ABILITY TO RESPOND

34
00:01:09,383 --> 00:01:11,185
AS WELL AS HE USED TO AND TELL

35
00:01:11,185 --> 00:01:12,987
LIES AS GOOD AS HE IS TWO.

36
00:01:12,987 --> 00:01:14,789
>> Laura: IF YOU ARE A YOUNG

37
00:01:14,789 --> 00:01:16,490
WOMAN, 27 YEARS OLD WHEN HE

38
00:01:16,490 --> 00:01:18,192
FIRST GOT INVOLVED WITH HIM.

39
00:01:18,192 --> 00:01:19,994
HE WAS MARRIED AND THAT YOU WERE

40
00:01:19,994 --> 00:01:22,396
NOT, AND YOU STARTED HAVING THIS

41
00:01:22,396 --> 00:01:23,931
RELATIONSHIP.

42
00:01:23,931 --> 00:01:27,368
AT SOME POINT, YOU HAVE NOW

43
00:01:27,368 --> 00:01:29,370
DECIDED THAT IT BECAME A

44
00:01:29,370 --> 00:01:32,773
NONCONSENSUAL HARASSMENT

45
00:01:32,773 --> 00:01:33,975
RELATIONSHIP, WHICH DOESN'T

46
00:01:33,975 --> 00:01:35,977
REALLY COMPORT WITH HOW YOU WERE

47
00:01:35,977 --> 00:01:36,811
ORIGINALLY CLASSIFIED THIS.

48
00:01:36,811 --> 00:01:37,745
SO NOW HOW ARE YOU ALL THESE

49
00:01:37,745 --> 00:01:43,050
YEARS LATER CLAIMING THAT IT WAS

50
00:01:43,050 --> 00:01:44,552
NONCONSENSUAL AT SOME POINT?

51
00:01:44,552 --> 00:01:46,687
>> IT'S VERY INTERESTING BECAUSE

52
00:01:46,687 --> 00:01:51,158
BACK IN 1977 WHEN I MET BILL, WE

53
00:01:51,158 --> 00:01:52,627
DIDN'T HAVE THE LAWS TO PROTECT

54
00:01:52,627 --> 00:01:52,893
US.

55
00:01:52,893 --> 00:01:55,997
WE AS WOMEN, I WAS IN THE

56
00:01:55,997 --> 00:01:57,198
WORKPLACE OF A MAN'S WORLD AND I

57
00:01:57,198 --> 00:01:58,966
HAD TO DO THE BEST THAT I COULD.

58
00:01:58,966 --> 00:02:01,168
WHEN I FIRST MET BILL CLINTON IT

59
00:02:01,168 --> 00:02:03,037
WAS WHEN I WAS SENT OUT ON MY

60
00:02:03,037 --> 00:02:04,772
FIRST STORY BY MYSELF AFTER MY

61
00:02:04,772 --> 00:02:06,607
TRAINING WITH MY CAMERA MAN.

62
00:02:06,607 --> 00:02:08,408
HE CAME OUT ON TO ME THAT NIGHT,

63
00:02:08,408 --> 00:02:10,845
I TOLD HIM TO KNOCK IT OFF.

64
00:02:10,845 --> 00:02:12,413
HE PROCEEDED TO CONTINUE TO COME

65
00:02:12,413 --> 00:02:14,882
ONTO ME FOR THREE MONTHS BEFORE

66
00:02:14,882 --> 00:02:16,450
I DECIDED THAT I WANTED TO HAVE

67
00:02:16,450 --> 00:02:18,686
A RELATIONSHIP WITH HIM, WHICH

68
00:02:18,686 --> 00:02:22,490
AT THAT POINT WAS CONSENSUAL.

69
00:02:22,490 --> 00:02:24,325
IN TODAY'S STANDARDS, AND IN

70
00:02:24,325 --> 00:02:26,160
HINDSIGHT, IT WAS DEFINITELY

71
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:26,661
SEXUAL HARASSMENT.

72
00:02:26,661 --> 00:02:28,562
I WAS A LITTLE BIT ASHAMED TO

73
00:02:28,562 --> 00:02:32,600
ADMIT THAT BECAUSE IN A WAY, I

74
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:35,169
FELT GUILTY BECAUSE I WAS A

75
00:02:35,169 --> 00:02:36,570
WILLING PARTICIPANT, AT A POINT.

76
00:02:36,570 --> 00:02:38,773
SO I FELT GUILTY ABOUT SAYING

77
00:02:38,773 --> 00:02:40,374
THAT I WAS SEXUALLY HARASSED IN

78
00:02:40,374 --> 00:02:41,976
THE BEGINNING.

79
00:02:41,976 --> 00:02:44,812
BUT IT DEFINITELY WAS,

80
00:02:44,812 --> 00:02:45,980
ABSOLUTELY.

81
00:02:45,980 --> 00:02:47,281
AND THEN -- >> Laura: WHEN HE

82
00:02:47,281 --> 00:02:52,553
IS THEY WANT HIM PROSECUTED --

83
00:02:52,553 --> 00:02:54,355
>> WHY NOT?

84
00:02:54,355 --> 00:02:55,556
>> Laura: FOR

85
00:02:55,556 --> 00:02:57,358
SEXUAL HARASSMENT, THAT'S A

86
00:02:57,358 --> 00:02:57,758
CIVIL CASE.

87
00:02:57,758 --> 00:03:08,769
FOR CRIMINAL PROSECUTION -- >>

88
00:03:08,769 --> 00:03:09,470
HE JUANITA.

89
00:03:09,470 --> 00:03:12,506
I'VE MET HER, SHE'S A BEAUTIFUL

90
00:03:12,506 --> 00:03:12,840
PERSON.

91
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:15,176
LIKE HILLARY I WANTED TO BE IN

92
00:03:15,176 --> 00:03:16,477
DENIAL, I WANTED DENY THESE

93
00:03:16,477 --> 00:03:17,878
THINGS COULD HAPPEN BECAUSE I

94
00:03:17,878 --> 00:03:19,714
FELT LIKE THAT WASN'T THE PERSON

95
00:03:19,714 --> 00:03:21,382
THAT I HAD KNOWN.

96
00:03:21,382 --> 00:03:22,950
BUT WHEN I MET HER THE FIRST

97
00:03:22,950 --> 00:03:24,418
TIME AND REALIZE THAT SHE WAS A

98
00:03:24,418 --> 00:03:26,053
VERY GENUINE PERSON AND HAD NO

99
00:03:26,053 --> 00:03:28,255
REASON TO LIE ABOUT THAT, I HAD

100
00:03:28,255 --> 00:03:30,391
TO COME TO TERMS WITH THE FACT

101
00:03:30,391 --> 00:03:32,493
THAT HE WAS VERY CAPABLE AND IT

102
00:03:32,493 --> 00:03:34,562
DID DO THAT.

103
00:03:34,562 --> 00:03:35,429
WHY SHOULDN'T HE BE PROSECUTED

104
00:03:35,429 --> 00:03:40,034
FOR RATE AS BILL COSBY HAS, AND

105
00:03:40,034 --> 00:03:42,970
HARVEY WEINSTEIN?

106
00:03:42,970 --> 00:03:44,972
WHY SHOULDN'T HE BE?

107
00:03:44,972 --> 00:03:47,308
WHY DON'T THEY ARREST HILLARY AS

108
00:03:47,308 --> 00:03:51,345
A COCONSPIRATOR BECAUSE SHE SHE

109
00:03:51,345 --> 00:03:52,980
HAS ALLOWED HIM -- SHE HAS BEEN

110
00:03:52,980 --> 00:03:55,349
THE PERSON THAT HAS LET HIM GO.

111
00:03:55,349 --> 00:03:57,384
AND BE THE ENABLER THAT HAS LET

112
00:03:57,384 --> 00:04:01,255
HIM GO AND DO WHAT HE HAS DONE

113
00:04:01,255 --> 00:04:01,622
TO WOMEN.

114
00:04:01,622 --> 00:04:03,591
>> Laura: BY THE WAY, WE

115
00:04:03,591 --> 00:04:05,793
REACHED OUT TO THE CLINTON

116
00:04:05,793 --> 00:04:06,827
FOUNDATION COME TO

117
00:04:06,827 --> 00:04:07,595
BILL CLINTON'S PERSONAL ATTORNEY

118
00:04:07,595 --> 00:04:10,030
DAVID KENDALL ABOUT THIS STORY

119
00:04:10,030 --> 00:04:11,398
AND ABOUT YOUR NEW ALLEGATIONS,

120
00:04:11,398 --> 00:04:14,568
AND WE DID NOT GET A RESPONSE,

121
00:04:14,568 --> 00:04:16,803
SO WE DID ATTEMPT TO DO THAT.

122
00:04:16,803 --> 00:04:18,706
>> OF COURSE NOT.

123
00:04:18,706 --> 00:04:20,673
>> Laura: I WANT TO PLAY A

124
00:04:20,673 --> 00:04:22,009
SNIPPET FROM BILL CLINTON, THIS

125
00:04:22,009 --> 00:04:27,014
WAS ALSO FROM THE NEW YORK EVENT

126
00:04:27,014 --> 00:04:27,414
LAST NIGHT.

127
00:04:27,414 --> 00:04:29,350
LET'S WATCH.

128
00:04:29,350 --> 00:04:32,586
>> I SUPPORT THE "ME TOO"

129
00:04:32,586 --> 00:04:34,155
MOVEMENT, AND I THINK IT'S LONG

130
00:04:34,155 --> 00:04:34,989
OVERDUE.

131
00:04:34,989 --> 00:04:38,492
I'VE ALWAYS TRIED TO IS

132
00:04:38,492 --> 00:04:42,163
SUPPORTED IN THE POLICIES I'VE

133
00:04:42,163 --> 00:04:42,530
ADVANCED.

134
00:04:42,530 --> 00:04:46,834
>> Laura: WHILE HE SAYS HE

135
00:04:46,834 --> 00:04:49,770
GENERALLY SUPPORTS THE MOVEMENT,

136
00:04:49,770 --> 00:04:52,439
GENNIFER, AND HE WANTS PEOPLE TO

137
00:04:52,439 --> 00:04:54,775
BELIEVE HIM AT THIS POINT.

138
00:04:54,775 --> 00:04:56,377
>> THAT'S THE FOURTH BIGGEST

139
00:04:56,377 --> 00:04:58,979
LIE, AND YOU KNOW SOME OF WHAT

140
00:04:58,979 --> 00:04:59,814
THE OTHERS ARE.

141
00:04:59,814 --> 00:05:04,251
HE WOULD SAY THAT, OF COURSE.

142
00:05:04,251 --> 00:05:06,787
WHAT WOULD HE SAY THAT BUT THAT

143
00:05:06,787 --> 00:05:08,889
HE WAS A IN SUPPORT OF IT.

144
00:05:08,889 --> 00:05:14,361
I WOULD LIKE FOR THE "ME TOO"

145
00:05:14,361 --> 00:05:19,567
MOVEMENT TO RECOGNIZE MYSELF AND

146
00:05:19,567 --> 00:05:21,035
PAULA AND WANITA AND OTHER WOMEN

147
00:05:21,035 --> 00:05:22,837
THAT MANY, MANY YEARS AGO HAVE

148
00:05:22,837 --> 00:05:24,638
COME UP WITH CLAIMS OF

149
00:05:24,638 --> 00:05:28,075
SEXUAL HARASSMENT BY

150
00:05:28,075 --> 00:05:28,509
BILL CLINTON.

151
00:05:28,509 --> 00:05:39,186
WE ARE THE "ME NOT" MOVEMENT IS

152
00:05:39,186 --> 00:05:39,753
WHAT WE ARE.

153
00:05:39,753 --> 00:05:43,591
>> Laura: WHY DO YOU SAY THAT?

154
00:05:43,591 --> 00:05:44,792
'S BEFORE THEY GET AWAY WITH

155
00:05:44,792 --> 00:05:47,595
THINGS AND THIS IS JUST ANOTHER

156
00:05:47,595 --> 00:05:48,696
INSTANCE OF THAT.

157
00:05:48,696 --> 00:05:54,201
HE HASN'T BEEN HELD ACCOUNTABLE.

158
00:05:54,201 --> 00:05:58,072
>> Laura: I THINK THE "ME TOO"

159
00:05:58,072 --> 00:05:59,273
MOVEMENT, LOTS OF GOOD STUFF

160
00:05:59,273 --> 00:06:03,711
GOING ON BUT SADLY A LOT OF IT

161
00:06:03,711 --> 00:06:04,778
IS POLITICIZED.

162
00:06:04,778 --> 00:06:05,779
KIND OF LIKE WANTING A BROAD

163
00:06:05,779 --> 00:06:07,615
RECORD, THEY DON'T COUNT.

164
00:06:07,615 --> 00:06:09,583
PEOPLE LIKE KATHLEEN WILLEY,

165
00:06:09,583 --> 00:06:10,417
THEY DON'T COUNT.

166
00:06:10,417 --> 00:06:12,386
HOW ARE YOU DOING, BY THE WAY,

167
00:06:12,386 --> 00:06:14,989
HOW ARE YOU DOING AFTER ALL

168
00:06:14,989 --> 00:06:16,190
THESE YEARS?

169
00:06:16,190 --> 00:06:19,159
YOU LOOK GREAT, BY THE WAY.

170
00:06:19,159 --> 00:06:21,061
>> Gennifer: THANK YOU, AND

171
00:06:21,061 --> 00:06:21,662
GOD BLESS YOU.

172
00:06:21,662 --> 00:06:23,397
I LOVE YOU BY THE WAY.

173
00:06:23,397 --> 00:06:25,599
I'M DOING FINE, I'M DOING A

174
00:06:25,599 --> 00:06:26,567
REBOOT OF MY BOOK.

175
00:06:26,567 --> 00:06:28,802
I LOST MY MOTHER IN JULY OF LAST

176
00:06:28,802 --> 00:06:31,405
YEAR, SO THAT HAS BEEN A HUGE

177
00:06:31,405 --> 00:06:32,606
THING TO OVERCOME.

178
00:06:32,606 --> 00:06:35,009
BUT I'M DOING GOOD, THANKS FOR

179
00:06:35,009 --> 00:06:36,010
ASKING.

180
00:06:36,010 --> 00:00:00,000
AND THANKS FOR HAVING ME.
