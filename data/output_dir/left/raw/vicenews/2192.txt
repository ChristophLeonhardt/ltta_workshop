1
00:00:00,510 --> 00:00:09,840
I think most Americans would agree that

2
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:13,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">for defense or security some lawful</font>

3
00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:15,990
surveillance is fine but in some cases

4
00:00:15,990 --> 00:00:18,690
it sort of went beyond that you worry

5
00:00:18,690 --> 00:00:21,060
about that well sure that's why we have

6
00:00:21,060 --> 00:00:24,860
to do this very carefully

7
00:00:35,010 --> 00:00:37,350
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> greatest fear that I have regarding</font>

8
00:00:37,350 --> 00:00:42,239
<font color="#E5E5E5">the outcome for America of these</font>

9
00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:45,769
disclosures is that<font color="#E5E5E5"> nothing will change</font>

10
00:00:49,379 --> 00:00:52,540
mr. Snowden has been accused of leaking

11
00:00:52,540 --> 00:00:55,329
classified information and he faces

12
00:00:55,329 --> 00:00:57,040
felony charges here in the United<font color="#CCCCCC"> States</font>

13
00:00:57,040 --> 00:00:59,710
what's your view of him and<font color="#E5E5E5"> his motives</font>

14
00:00:59,710 --> 00:01:02,260
it Edward<font color="#CCCCCC"> Snowden is a hero a patriot</font>

15
00:01:02,260 --> 00:01:04,869
would not run away and look for refuge

16
00:01:04,869 --> 00:01:07,420
in Russia Cuba or some other country a

17
00:01:07,420 --> 00:01:09,700
patriot would stand up in the United

18
00:01:09,700 --> 00:01:11,740
<font color="#CCCCCC">States and make his case to the American</font>

19
00:01:11,740 --> 00:01:14,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">people</font>

20
00:01:33,220 --> 00:01:36,410
through successes and strains our ties

21
00:01:36,410 --> 00:01:39,800
have broadly endured but I believe we

22
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:41,780
<font color="#CCCCCC">must renew the bonds of trust and</font>

23
00:01:41,780 --> 00:01:44,300
rebuild<font color="#E5E5E5"> the bridge between the Pentagon</font>

24
00:01:44,300 --> 00:01:47,680
in Silicon Valley

25
00:01:57,330 --> 00:01:59,710
now you can correct<font color="#E5E5E5"> me if I'm wrong I</font>

26
00:01:59,710 --> 00:02:02,890
believe your your physicists elementary

27
00:02:02,890 --> 00:02:04,630
particle physics elementary fine

28
00:02:04,630 --> 00:02:07,170
distinction right so you're a scientist

29
00:02:07,170 --> 00:02:10,060
you're also you know nap<font color="#E5E5E5"> Secretary of</font>

00:02:10,060 --> 00:02:14,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">Defense under the DoD you run also the</font>

31
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:19,090
NSA do you have a job to do to fix the

32
00:02:19,090 --> 00:02:22,450
bridges with Silicon Valley after<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

33
00:02:22,450 --> 00:02:25,630
NSA surveillance problem yes we

34
00:02:25,630 --> 00:02:27,730
definitely do and that's a good way of

35
00:02:27,730 --> 00:02:29,860
putting in build bridges because the

36
00:02:29,860 --> 00:02:33,130
Snowden disclosures put people in a bad

37
00:02:33,130 --> 00:02:36,130
position and I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> we need to</font>

38
00:02:36,130 --> 00:02:38,709
emphasize a couple of things<font color="#CCCCCC"> about how</font>

39
00:02:38,709 --> 00:02:41,530
we try to conduct ourselves<font color="#E5E5E5"> right one is</font>

40
00:02:41,530 --> 00:02:43,780
we try to do only<font color="#E5E5E5"> things that are lawful</font>

41
00:02:43,780 --> 00:02:46,300
and appropriate second our whole purpose

42
00:02:46,300 --> 00:02:49,030
is to<font color="#E5E5E5"> protect</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> people and facilitate</font>

43
00:02:49,030 --> 00:02:50,920
<font color="#CCCCCC">internet commerce as by</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the way the</font>

44
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:52,480
Defense Department des for many decades

45
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:55,570
and the Snowden revelations there's no

46
00:02:55,570 --> 00:02:58,690
<font color="#CCCCCC">question about it created a barrier</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

47
00:02:58,690 --> 00:03:02,590
suspicion President Obama says don't

48
00:03:02,590 --> 00:03:04,510
worry it's only metadata he's<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

49
00:03:04,510 --> 00:03:06,730
saying don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> worry you're all just under</font>

50
00:03:06,730 --> 00:03:08,890
surveillance I think most Americans

51
00:03:08,890 --> 00:03:12,250
would agree that<font color="#E5E5E5"> for defense or security</font>

52
00:03:12,250 --> 00:03:15,730
some lawful surveillance is fine but in

53
00:03:15,730 --> 00:03:17,799
some cases it sort of went beyond that

54
00:03:17,799 --> 00:03:19,600
you know one of the definitions of a

55
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:21,660
police state is having the police

56
00:03:21,660 --> 00:03:23,830
watching you at all times knowing what

57
00:03:23,830 --> 00:03:25,239
you're doing at all times do you worry

58
00:03:25,239 --> 00:03:27,640
about that well sure that's why we have

59
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:30,790
to do this very carefully we need to

60
00:03:30,790 --> 00:03:32,950
behave in<font color="#CCCCCC"> such a way but also be</font>

61
00:03:32,950 --> 00:03:34,780
<font color="#CCCCCC">understood to behave you to such a way</font>

62
00:03:34,780 --> 00:03:36,489
that we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not trying to get into</font>

63
00:03:36,489 --> 00:03:39,010
anybody's business or their thoughts

64
00:03:39,010 --> 00:03:41,799
<font color="#E5E5E5">we're trying to protect people against</font>

65
00:03:41,799 --> 00:03:44,680
terrorists against intellectual property

66
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:47,410
thieves and you can't just say<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you</font>

67
00:03:47,410 --> 00:03:49,660
have to prove<font color="#CCCCCC"> that and that means we</font>

68
00:03:49,660 --> 00:03:53,680
have to operate under laws we can't tell

69
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:55,530
people everything we're doing

70
00:03:55,530 --> 00:03:57,900
and still protect them that's why<font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font>

71
00:03:57,900 --> 00:04:00,510
have a<font color="#E5E5E5"> Congress that's why we have laws</font>

72
00:04:00,510 --> 00:04:03,060
and ports and so forth so that they can

73
00:04:03,060 --> 00:04:05,550
check on us and believe<font color="#E5E5E5"> me we tell them</font>

74
00:04:05,550 --> 00:04:07,800
everything we're doing it's very very

75
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:10,590
difficult I think to have a transparent

76
00:04:10,590 --> 00:04:14,430
debate about secret programs approved by

77
00:04:14,430 --> 00:04:17,160
a secret court issuing secret court

78
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:19,858
orders based on secret interpretations

79
00:04:19,858 --> 00:04:22,800
of the law I know that<font color="#CCCCCC"> this is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the first</font>

80
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:26,490
time in 20 years that a sitting

81
00:04:26,490 --> 00:04:30,180
Secretary of<font color="#E5E5E5"> Defense has visited Silicon</font>

82
00:04:30,180 --> 00:04:34,140
Valley why now well<font color="#E5E5E5"> because it's one of</font>

83
00:04:34,140 --> 00:04:35,970
the hubs of American innovation and

84
00:04:35,970 --> 00:04:38,790
because the institution I'm responsible

85
00:04:38,790 --> 00:04:42,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">for the department defense we need to</font>

stay the best in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> world the only way</font>

87
00:04:45,270 --> 00:04:46,950
to do that just like any business that

88
00:04:46,950 --> 00:04:48,990
wants to be cutting<font color="#E5E5E5"> edge if we're going</font>

89
00:04:48,990 --> 00:04:51,210
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be cutting edge we have to be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> open to</font>

change and we have to be<font color="#CCCCCC"> open to the</font>

91
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:55,380
rest of the world I would like to

92

<font color="#E5E5E5">continue to attract the very best to the</font>

93
00:04:58,889 --> 00:05:01,620
US military and to the Department of

94
00:05:01,620 --> 00:05:03,330
Defense mission we want to be an

95
00:05:03,330 --> 00:05:05,160
environment where kids who are

96
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:08,100
innovative and really smart want to be

97
00:05:08,100 --> 00:05:09,540
even if they don't spend their whole

98
00:05:09,540 --> 00:05:11,970
life there just spend a couple<font color="#E5E5E5"> years</font>

with<font color="#E5E5E5"> us we'll get something out of it</font>

100
00:05:13,860 --> 00:05:15,660
they'll get something out of a mutual

00:05:15,660 --> 00:05:18,600
benefit mr.<font color="#CCCCCC"> secretary thank you very</font>

102
