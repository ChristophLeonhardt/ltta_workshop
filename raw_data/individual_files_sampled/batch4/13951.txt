President Trump is making single-life braid again at least for one Florida woman who says she's divorcing her husband in part over his inability to deal with her love for the commander-in-chief according to divorce records Palm Beach State Attorney Dave Arenberg and his wife Lynne Ehrenberg the former Miami Dolphins cheerleader are parting ways for a variety of reasons ranging from Muslim willingness to have children to her politics quote a staunch Republican and supporter of President Trump Lynne also said she felt increasingly isolated in their marriage their public relations release stated Ehrenburg is a Democrat Lynne is a Republican it wasn't an issue at first but that was before the Hillary Trump saga I should explain and as that built the tension in our relationship built David Ehrenburg was tangentially involved in the 2016 election when he dropped assault charges against then Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski he worked with Trump at Merrill our ago for years but after Trump's political rise he tried to distance himself I'm walking through red carpet Lyndon state and he's snaking through the bushes he'd asked me not to take pictures he wouldn't want me to post them I didn't listen to him she said she took selfies with Trump at her husband didn't like it obviously Lynne is hungry for some publicity but there are a few lessons from this tragic tale of marital woe first to publicity hungry people probably shouldn't marry each other this seems like a lesson that the scare emojis have also learned in the recent past their agendas obviously weren't aligned and if mrs. ehrenburg's agenda deviated from her husband she seemed happy to ignore his agenda in favor of her own and vice versa second people have different political preferences should think seriously before tying the knot politics often reflects deeper values and while we're fond of papering over those differences because of her the reality of marriage requires that two people share a set of values in order to live a successful life together finally the Trump era has polarized people in a unique way that's because Trump himself is polarizing he's loud he's brash with a thousand character flaws that endear him to some innately and others people tend to see feelings about Trump as a referendum on character and that speaks to the problem with treating our politicians and celebrities in general the point of politics is that we have certain policies and ideas we would like to see promulgated and politicians are a vehicle for those policies and ideas the character of politicians only matters insofar as it speaks to the trustworthiness and capable 'no supper s'en making promises with regard to policy but now policy has taken a backseat to the attitude of politicians we care a lot more about what Asians are like and what they say then what we'd like them to do that means that if someone likes Trump we tend to judge them not with regard to the policies they'd like to promote but with regard to their apparent approbation of Trump's shortcomings that's often inaccurate even nasty attempt to improve motivation and publicity marriages don't tend to end quietly outside the glare of the press I'm Ben Shapiro this is the Ben Shapiro show oh there's a lot happening in the news I'm still a little bit wife dad to be honest with you we had a debate with Chang lugar Eiger last night at I'm still bad with his last name but it was a lot of fun over political on last night huge crowd like 3,000 people we had to move the auditorium mostly fans of the show fans of mine it was great thank you all for coming out really appreciate it we did a Q&A as well that was fantastic 800 900 people showed up standing room only there's a real hunger I think for politics and for and for truth-telling and honesty in politics and I really do appreciate that that's that's the case it was actually a really good debate it was a substance of debate I was not expecting it to be to be honest with you I thought it was going to devolve into name-calling and nastiness because I teach shanks debates with Ann Coulter and Dinesh D'Souza in the last couple of years but Chang really did stick to the topics which is fantastic and I think I did too and it was a really good back-and-forth I'll let you be the judge of who you thought won but it was it was really great we're going to play some clips of it tomorrow we're pulling all the clips of it today so it will have some material tomorrow it was fascinating and interesting and I think really good I

okay so the big news over the weekend we discussed it a little bit on Friday is that Reince Priebus is gone so that happened shortly after we filmed our show on Friday I post a little Facebook note about it but the situation surrounding Priebus being ousted was really quite incredible so previous was fired apparently they took him to that he was there still debate over whether he had resigned the previous day so remember we have to reverse chorus for a second remember Anthony scaramouche he was hired as the new White House head of comms and Skinner Moochie had designed on being the guy closest to Trump that meant that he wanted to oust previous so he did an interview on the record with the new yorker in which he suggested that Steve ban in order to perform anatomically impossible acts upon himself and suggested that Reince Priebus was a paranoid schizophrenic who was always afraid someone was out to get him it turns out someone was out to get him a guy named Anthony scaramouche II as it turns out and after that interview happened Trump didn't discipline scare emoji he didn't say anything about skin when she's saying anything bad he didn't say that that was inappropriate none of that apparently according to the New York Post he loved the interview of scaramouche because this is who Trump is a trump is a combative guy who has a potty mouth and really likes when people yell at each other he sort of finds it entertaining he really is in terms of personnel a lot like the Joker from Dark Knight you know break this pool cue there's only one slot available apparently he was angry at Bryan's previous according to reports which is just hilarious who's angry at Rhines that Ryan's didn't fire back at scare Moochie so he liked that scaramouche she was saying that Bryan's was a paranoid schizophrenic who didn't have trump's best intentions at heart and he was angry at Reince that ryan's didn't slap scare emoji back so he can watch the slap fight which is a very Joffrey Baratheon thing to do I mean it's pretty incredible so chosen the next day Reince supposed that they apparently run supposedly resigns except that he didn't really resign he went on a plane with Trump to Long Island where Trump did a speech to some sort of police event which is controversial in themself and because Trump said something about how if you're if you're a police officer don't be too gentle with suspects like putting a hand on the top of their head when they get in the car so they don't bump their head they just killed somebody why are you doing that what not some of that but in any case you know I think that's a bit of exaggerated I don't think Trump was openly calling for police brutality but in any case what what happened is that Ryan's gets on the plane he comes back on the plane well they're on the plane Trump tweets out that Ryan's has been fired and he's been replaced by General John Kelly Kelly is the head of the Department of Homeland Security so Ryan says I resigned yesterday but that doesn't explain why I was on the plane so they get out of the plane and Ryan's gets in a car with apparently dance Covino who's one of the comms directors over at the White House as well as a newsman and with the third person and then scavino and Bannon get out of that car get in another car and drive in the opposite direction and Reince Priebus just drives off into the sunset it really was very much like the scene from The Godfather you know leave the gun take the cannoli and Ryan says Ryan so sort of left there by himself so Trump now has to paper this over so on Friday he says Reince is great I love friends sure I didn't say anything when people were saying as a paranoid schizophrenic sure I've been tripping on paper for months secretly sure I think he's a doofus but you just great unbelievable tremendous go John Kelly will do a fantastic job general Kelly has been a star got an incredible job does far respected by everybody a great great American Reince Priebus a good man thank you very much John Keller is a great American rice cream is easy dude I knew him for a little while yeah okay so this so there's a lot of hope when the Trump administration from from followers then now that Kelly who's general is in charge in terms of the White House chief of staff there will be a little more structure to this because so far we have seen the exit of the National Security Adviser the firing of the FBI director Trump attacking his own attorney general we have seen the ouster of Reince Priebus and we've seen the ouster of Sean Spicer it's a lot of turnover in any organization that's a lot of turnover like here at the Ben Shapiro show we've actually had the same staff since day one because we did a pretty good job of selecting our staff Trump said he had selected the best people yeah hard to argue that when you're firing somebody every couple of months there's plenty tweet from somebody on Friday says is Trump aware that he doesn't have to fire somebody every Friday because the Friday before was Sean Spicer and then last week was itwas Reince Priebus and this is one of the reasons why you're seeing his approval rating plummet among Republicans there's a feeling that Trump is in over his head and that he doesn't actually know it he's doing the combination of the fact that Trump care went down in flames last week even skinnier appeal went down in flames and Trump came into office pledging this is going to be easy i'ma repeal Obamacare and the greatest deal maker who ever was and then none of that gets done and he doesn't even really campaign for very hard a lot of people were very upset about that and then you combine that with all of the turnover and his administration and it feels like he doesn't really know any students there's a Rasmussen poll out today Rasmussen has been the friendliest poll to Donald Trump he's down to 39% in the Rasmussen ratings ten days ago he was it excuse me 44% in the Rasmussen poll so he's dropped five points 61 percent disapproving John Nolte has been a staunch support rights for The Daily wire love John he and I disagree about a lot of things but he's great guy he writes a he Key's he writes a piece today about this Rasmussen poll and it's appropriately brutal he says the failure of the Obamacare repeal bill maybe for forever is inexpressibly demoralizing and infuriating - Trump supporters whether or not you blame the president for the failure of the Republican Party to keep a seven-year promise I promise that defined them and justified their existence as a majority from still assured and reassured us he would make this happen Trump ran on getting things done and on top of tax reform in a border wall between the u.s. and Mexico repealing Obamacare was his three Biggie's the Obamacare repeal knocks some of the luster off of Trump and his biggest selling point his deal-making skills secondly the chaos in the Trump administration finally became real with the resignations and firings of press secretary Sean Spicer chief of staff Reince Priebus and the newly installed communications director Anthony scaramouche's gobsmacking unforgivably hypocritical breathtakingly obscene comments leaks to New York Magazine scaramouche's the man from hired to get the White House communications department in shipshape and to stop all these leaks to the corrupt media and what is the first thing that's idiot is does he runs to the corrupt media leaks like crazy and causes a massive distraction just when the Russia story is beginning to collapse under the weight of the facts Trump hired this man Trump did this debacle is on Trump that's appropriately brutal language I think from John Nolte who's been a strong strong supporter of President Trump throughout the primary throughout the general and as president he's getting it from all sides as Trump and I think deservedly so at this point he needs to do a better job now one of the things that is is frustrating about the way that the previous firing was done is he was fired in such a brutal and demeaning manner that when Priebus then went on national TV and said everything's okay nobody believed them so he went on national TV and he talked about how everything is just spectacular it's just great didn't interview with Breitbart and you interview at CNN here's the one from CNN where he talks you what Blitzer he says everything has just it could not be better just unbelievably great he knows I think intuitively when things need the change I've seen it now for a year and a half on this wild ride with the president that that I love being a part of but he intuitively determined that it was time to do something differently and I think he's right okay so I think he's right to fire me and replace me I mean this sort of kind of kiss he asked to reform Reince Priebus comes off that way because everybody knows the kind of cast that's going on inside again that's scaramouche's fault okay it's government you went out and made clear what kind of cast was happening here and that's the guy Trump chose that's the guy Trump chose to put his faith in if you want to project if you want to project stability this is what's amazing about this Trump is good at some things one of the things he's really terrific at and has been his entire career has been image right there's been his entire career Trump actually isn't that great of real estate but he is fantastic at image right scare emoji too scared which in that grade investing but he's fantastic an image rights government she's the kind of guy who spent a hundred thousand dollars to get a cameo in Wall Street ooh really drops $100,000 to the Comfort to the studio so you could get like a five second cameo in Wall Street to one of the biggest bombs in recent history it's all about image creation for Trump if you want to create the image of a president who's in charge knows what he's doing this passive-aggressive tweeting and then sending out your director of comms to talk about how Steve Annan wants to suck his own clock that does not actually that is not actually forward the agenda in any real way I mean on the same day the Priebus was saying that everything is on board everybody is great this is all terrific he's now going on national television having tonight that he's a leaker are you the leaker in the White House dick ulis wolf come on give me a break I'm not going to get into his well why not respond to his I'm not going to because it doesn't honor the president it doesn't honor the president again all that makes Brian's previous look like he's a weakling because if you really wanted to honor the president the president's the one who hired scare emoji so what you have is the look of people who are trying to be one of the Trump like previous they look like suckers and the people who are trying to be loyal in the way scare Moochie is attacking all the people they perceive as Trump enemies they look like sycophants none of this is good for a White House that is trying to project calm into an American political system that is really riled up at this point now there is some good news in all the surgeons the economy continues to grow 2.6 percent growth in the second quarter which is good strong growth Trump has been saying he wants four percent growth not going to happen but if he got us to 2.6 percent growth every quarter that's that strong growth that'd be fantastic that is largely because and this is I think a point that a lot from supporters make that is correct there is a feeling that no matter what Trump does at this point with the Republican Congress and we say it's not going to make things economically worse you're not going to see them passing lots of regulations you're not going to see him taking a lot of harsh stances against the business community at least you're not going to do that the the success of business relies on predictability if you're a business owner what you don't want is your taxes being jacked up every five minutes or lowered and then jacked up and lowered and jacked up you just don't know how to hire people under those circumstances Trump even his incompetence provides a certain level of stability because you know that nothing is going to get done so you may as well assume the system that's in place now is the system that's going in place six months from now but in terms of foreign policy this does have some real ramifications which I'm going to talk about in just a second but first I want to say thank you to our sponsors over at Realty shares so if you are looking into investing and one of the places you want to invest is in the real estate market but you don't know that much about

and check it out realty shares calm / that okay so as I say the chaos when when it's being shrugged off but there's just more evidence of chaos it makes people feel discomforted we've heard now for well over a year that there was gonna be a reset at some like that was going to make people feel solid first the reset happened with Bannon and Bannon did a pretty good job with the campaign as much as I dislike him personally you got to give credit where credit is due you did a good job with getting Trump under control for a lot of the campaign and then after the election after Trump was mouthing off there's vo Keys assembling this fantastic cabinet and they will keep him under control and then he starts firing people in his cabinet and now again we're getting the same routine we're getting the same routine now John Kelly is coming in and now he's coming in as a strong replacement finally things will be under control at the White House here's Jon Karl from ABC News making that case he comes in as a much more powerful chief of staff than right previous ever was if you remember Martha when Priebus became chief of staff he was announced along with Steve Bannon as the chief strategist with Jared Kushner as a senior advisor now the power of all three positions theoretically at least will reside with general Kelley he will have authority that Reince Priebus never had but as you know the issue throughout these first six months is that the real chief of staff in that way that White House has been Donald Trump so the question is whether or not he will truly cede that authority to general Kelley and if you'll listen to him so that is the question apparently general Kelley was told by his wife do you not take this job do not do it and the early rumors were that everything's going to run from Kelley now and then immediately within an hour that was debunked immediately there were people saying that scare Moochie would not report to Kelley he would report directly to Trump once you have many channels of communication to the top of the line you got a problem okay at our company I wouldn't let Mathis talk to me not Sondra but but but the fact is that we do have a line of communication when it comes to serious personnel issues for example you go up the chain this is true at any company okay the idea you can have everybody going to the boss with everything leads to chaos inside the administration this is an administration that needs solidity right now because they are not getting a lot of policy wins and so the feeling of chaos has ramifications one of those ramifications that you are seeing America's enemies feeling emboldened there are a couple of things that have happened in the last two weeks that make America's enemies feel like they might be able to get away with something the first thing I think that happened is Trump attacking his own attorney general but not firing him I actually think that it's not just the attacks on sessions that are bad but if you are going to attack your own AG you need to fire him okay you need to demonstrate that you are a strong guy not a chling who just whines about the people he works with I don't go around the office whining about the people who work for me if I don't like them I fire them that's what bosses do okay if Trump is the biggest boss in the world which he is then if you are Trump and you don't like your AG and you keep them around that makes it look like you do not have a credible commitment to actually carry through your commitment that's why GLAAD Miren putas now starting get aggressive you expel a ting 755 American diplomats over the weekend North Korea fires off another missile they say this is an ICBM that is capable of hitting large swathes of the United States we're seeing America's enemies begin to get more aggressive and here's the question is this a White House that is prepared for disaster is this a White House that is prepared for bad things to happen remember with all the chaos with all the tumult with all of this happening nothing externally bad has happened to the Trump administration the economy has been very solid the economy has been very strong on the poor and on the foreign policy sphere no major moves has actually been made Landro Putin is not making major moves yet China is not making major moves yet everybody was trying to figure out is Trump bluffing or is Trump really a crazy guy who might do anything yeah after Syria after Trump hit Syria with the missile there was a feeling like we just can't predict this guy he might go nuts and he might fire a missile now it looks more like what Trump is is actually very predictable he's not unpredictably unpredictably crazy which might actually be a good thing this is one of the cases for Trump on foreign policy but he might actually be super predictable that is he has a knee-jerk response to aggression which is he fires a missile but then he chickens out then he decides you know what I can't do anything here I don't want to risk my own image and political capital to do anything and you could see America's enemy start to take advantage that's why Mike Pence is flying over to a lot of the NATO countries trying to reassure them that they were protected from Putin if I were a NATO comment country right now I would be a little less sanguine about the prospects that President Trump would intervene should Russia start to actually get aggressive in any serious way Trump is the image of the presidency matters that's why people elected Trump they elected Trump to be the image he was on TV the strong powerful leader right this is still his image according to polls the strong powerful leader who's effective at what he does right now he has not been effective right now he does not look strong right now he looks like he is presiding over a chaotic household he looks like a stepfather in a chaotic household where no one knows where dinner is coming from the tonight that is not what you need from the President of the United States it has some predictable effects for health care as well we'll talk about that in just a second but for that you're gonna have

subscribe we always appreciate it we are the largest conservative podcast in the nation you so the impression of chaos inside the administration has real politic ramifications one of those ramifications as we saw last week was the fact that Trump was not able in any real way to rally support behind any form of a healthcare belt and you saw him yes it like last week he tweeted out Republicans pass pass health care to make it better do it and John had horrors from commentary magazine he said what exactly is it and I tweeted back it John it and that's sort of the problem you don't know what it is so when Trump supports something you don't know what it is that he is supporting and so I think Trump actually made a bit of a boo-boo so Trump has been saying openly and publicly we need to let Obamacare implode let it collapse let it implode let it collapse let it go down in flames he's actually not wrong okay Obamacare is a crappy scheme Obamacare is a garbage scheme but the idea that you are going to let Obamacare implode that's something you don't say out loud that something you say in strategy sessions so to give you a point of a point of contrast go back to 2013 Ted Cruz says we're not going to fund Obamacare from the from the Congress of the Congressional side and we're not going to pass a budget that includes funding for Obamacare and Obama says fine I won't sign a budget that doesn't include funding for Obamacare so what does Obama do right the government shuts down when it turns out when the government shut down nothing bad happened everyone was pretty much okay the zombies did not wander the streets there was no foreign invasion members the military were still getting paid everything was still basic Social Security checks were still going out you know everything was still basically working because essential services still run in a government shutdown everything was basically okay but somehow Obama had to suggest to Americans that true disaster was waiting just around the corner so what did he do he quietly went out and he closed open air war memorials he closed the national parks you remember this is a big scandal at the time this back in December 2012 I believe in January 2013 and he was doing it on purpose right he was clearly shutting these open air war memorials where again it's an open-air memorial it's literally just a statue in a park and he was closing them down and putting chains around them and preventing people from getting it preventing war veterans from getting in to visit memorials to their war buddies he was doing all of that in order to up the pain factor and we on the right were going nuts I remember we're saying he's doing this on purpose because he's trying to make something that isn't that bad into something that is absolutely terrible so that he can put pressure on the American people and that's gross he got away with it because he was smart enough to recognize that he couldn't openly hit it now imagine how that would have gone if he had said that if you'd said listen we're in the middle of government shutdown you know and in a government shutdown I understand things aren't that bad but I'm gonna make things worse I want you to feel the pipe and if you feel the pipe I think that you will be more likely to support my agenda it would have undercut his agenda right we already gone that's kind of a douchey thing to do really we all would have said that seems kind of yucky so that's what has to happen with Obamacare so what Trump really should be doing right now he should be saying well the Obamacare structure is unworkable we're seeing in many many states Obamacare exchanges don't have even a single provider the individual market is being crushed by the weight of these regulations and President Obama was signing over illegal subsidies he was trying to he was trying to buck up he was trying to fill in the gaps in his own crappy plan by doing something illegal and I don't care what the Supreme Court has to say about this there is nothing in Obamacare that allows me legally to give funding to these insurance companies and so I'm not going to give funding to these insurance companies if States want to fill in the gaps that's their business but Democrats need to relieve the regulations if the prices are going up that's because I am unwilling to cheat I am unwilling to spend money that is not allocated by law in order to prop up a Democrats crappy system I'm not going to do that because that crappy system is foreclosing us from having a better system and if Democrats want the system to continue sucking then it's on them it's not on me I'm just following the law as it's written and I'm not going to participate in bailouts just because the insurance just because the Democrats want me to so that's what he should say here's what he actually says which is saying what his actual strategy is maybe in his own head now the last part by the way all everything I just said is true right I wouldn't even be him lying all that is true but instead here's what he says women advice are turning the tide in the battle against ms-13 but we need more resources from Congress and we're getting them Congress is actually opening up and really doing a job they should have approved healthcare last night but you can't have everything boy oh boy they've been working on that one for seven years can you believe that to swamp but we'll get it done we're good you know I said from the beginning let obamacare implode and then do it I turned out to be right let Obamacare implode okay when he says that it sounds like he is now taking ownership of Obamacare imploding right that's like the case where okay there's a there's a person who's drowning in a river and you say okay well how can we save that person there are two ways to save the person one is there's a person who's a better swimmer than you and you need to incentivize that person to go swim so you say listen I can't do it right I'm not capable of actually saving that person I can jump in the river but I can't save that person there's no way for me to save that person you should go do it or we can work together and we can go out there together and try and save that person right or what you could do is you could take let him drown let him drown the problem with the pr4 let him drown as it sounds like you're okay with letting people's around right and this is what the emma-crats are going to do this is a campaign ad for Democrats okay what they're going to do is they're going to cut let Obamacare implode with the rising premiums now they're going to say the rising premiums are Trump's fall because you could prevent this but he's not going to prevent this he tweeted out this morning from between if Obamacare is hurting people and it is why shouldn't it hurt the insurance companies and why should Congress not be paying with the public pays so I think so I agree totally what the Congress should be paying what the public pays force them into the individual markets they live with the consequences of the system they've set up for everyone else totally fine with that but why shouldn't it hurt the insurance companies is a Bernie Sanders argument that is not a conservative argument the reason insurance companies right now are charging higher premiums is because of the Obamacare regulations when you say things like why shouldn't it hurt the insurance companies that's Bernie Sanders's case Bernie Sanders says what we should actually do if we want to hurt the insurance companies is we should just nationalize the whole thing Medicare for all medve kapha all right that's the routine that they are pushing toward so again how you approach the issue matters I want to see Obamacare go probably far more than president Trump does I've said from the beginning Obamacare actually corrupts the soul of the country but you know President Trump is pursuing the right goal in the wrong way and every time you pursue the right goal in the wrong way you end up not achieving the goal and actually undercutting the goal you can see how this is all a democratic ad right Chuck Schumer yesterday starts to use it as a democratic add here the Senate Minority Leader president Trump did a tweet last night and a tweet this morning not presidential his tweet last night said we're going to let the system collapse we're going to hurt innocent people because we're angry we lost politically that is small that is not what a president does and I hope our Senate colleagues our house colleagues on his side of the aisle will turn a deaf ear on that okay so you at the Democratic ad you can see it playing out in real time and they're going to be Republican to go along with that Democratic ad like Susan Collins from Maine who is a quote-unquote moderate Republican she now is trying to take ownership of this whole thing she says health care is in our court right if we don't fix it it's our fault President Trump as you know is hoping to revive the effort to repeal and replace Obamacare he needs the vote of one more senator in order to flip someone's vote whether yours or Murkowski or McCain's the president appears to be threatening to cut off funding for the health care plans that members of Congress receive would that kind of pressure change your vote no but you know the ball is really in our court right now there are serious problems for the ACA we're seeing collapsing markets and some areas of the country where even though people have subsidies they're not going to be able to buy an insurance policy so our job is not done and what we need to do is to remember my friend Lamar Alexander's words which is that he says that Congress doesn't do comprehensive well we need to go back to committee to the help committee what he's doing so he's probably really driving a unified health plan from the right and the left is she really doing that or is what he's doing actually creating opposition to himself from the quote unquote moderate Republicans like Suzanne Collins and the left that's going to blame Trump for everything now it's not good PR Bernie Sanders again he actually did this last night right this is Bernie Sanders yesterday saying Trump also said they're trying to dump it on Trump and Trump is making it easy because he's actually not doing the one part of his job he's supposed to be best at the imaging right that's the party's supposed to be a master at that's the part where he's supposed to be dominant that's the party doing the worst here's Bernie Sanders looking all weird with the tongue out of his mouth here about how great for his room guys talking about how Trump is going to threaten all Americans as well as my pudding cup and perhaps my second vacation home you know I really think it's incomprehensible that we have a President of the United States and what's the sabotage health care in America make life more difficult for millions of people who are struggling now to get the health insurance they need and to pay for that health insurance maybe the president should put down his stopped his quit twittering tweeting for a while and understand that America today is the only country only major country on earth not to guarantee health care to all people and the solution is not to throw tens of millions of people off of health insurance that they currently have okay so this is their whole stick and they're going to beating those drums Trump needs to do a better job with this now that said I think there's a critique that's growing among some people who were not Pro Trump during the last election cycle that I think is wrong and I think it's actually wrongheaded it's kind of interesting so John Kasich says that because of John Kasich god help us that work John Kasich John Kasich Florida the occurence Ohio Governor a Raisin in the Sun John Kasich I'm talking about how Trump's first six months have him worried for the country I'm worried about our country obviously Chris and here's the thing you know the White House is Romney winery solution it has great power but when I think about the people who have been able to lend voice to amplify that power what we need and I think perhaps the president can get there i sur hope so is sort of the sense of unity of hopefulness not of division but of lifting and and I think we're not seeing enough we're not seeing that right now okay so he's very critical of Trump he's always been critical of Trump he also looks like a wadded piece of paper the one through your pocket in the wash in any case John Kasich doing this routine you know that he's just discouraged by the state of the country Jeff Flake did the same thing in Arizona he says the GOP has lost its way we may have we may have lost what we were supposed to be I think similarly today the party has lost its way we've given into nativism and protectionism and I think that if we're going to be a governing party in the future in a majority party we've got to go back to traditional conservatism limited government economic freedom individual responsibility respect for free trade those are the principles that made us who we are okay so I agree with his basic principles but the idea the party is given in two nativism or any of this stuff I think that's an overreach into what 2016 was listen I've worried about this stuff too I've talked about it repeatedly I've said that I think that you know the anti trade tendencies of the Republican Party they're playing follow the leader but what I'm actually seeing I'm actually saying it's encouraging to me if then seeing that there are still people people who might disagree on a lot of this stuff who still have standards for Trump and that is a big thing that's a big thing because the fact is if your standard is going to be the man or your standard is going to be the principle now your principles may differ from mine but at least if you're say if your principles are still there then we can argue about the validity of the principles we're not just arguing about Trump the man I don't care about Trump the man Trump the man doesn't matter to me as I've said before politics used to exist on the basis of principles right there's a right-left spectrum it was the x-axis on politics and you from right to left you know if I was all the way out here on the right now there is a y-axis and that is Trump and people now judge each other based on whether they are pro Trump or anti Trump because I am at a zero on Pro Trump or anti Trump sometimes he's great sometimes you sucks I don't care you know I'm still all the way out to the right here but because I'm zero on the Trump scale there are a lot of people who tend to think that I'm moderate which is bizarre because I'm the most right-wing person that I know the problem is that if you're on the white spectrum and all you care about is a wide spectrum then the X spectrum completely disappeared it completely disappears that x axis completely disappears you can't argue with people on a different axis than you I can't argue with people or on that Y axis when I'm not even on the y axis I'm not on completely different axis and so what I'm actually seeing and I think is good is that there are people with whom I disagree who still are holding Trump to a standards one of those people is Laura Ingraham I've been very critical of Laura I think that she was very sick of panic toward Trump during the election cycle I thought that she glossed over a lot of things about him they're not conservative I think that she fibs to her audience sometimes about about what Trump's actual agenda was but Laura at least has limits and you see that right so Laura over the weekend she came out and she said scaramouche she's the adult right this is this guy that Trump hired is an idiot and he's and he's actually undermining the Trump administration antenna this is good this is encouraging Tucker Carlson Newt Gingrich they're starting to say the same things that means that there is some standard again I may not agree with their standard I may think that they've waited until too long to get upset about what Trump is doing but at least it means that there is still a rational debate that can be had along that x-axis because I can I can have a discussion with people who differ from me where they are on the x-axis I can't have a discussion with people who just want to talk about why Trump is God or why Trump is is Satan that's not a conversation that's worthwhile having here is Laura Ingraham basically for one's being critical of President Trump I think this is this I'm sorry I like scare emoji I think he's really talented but this episode is humiliating to the president I think it ultimately humiliates him it does not serve the communication of this agenda well I'm probably going to tick him off by saying it but I say it out of deep love and affection I'm not helping his agenda at all so you can see that he Lord is still trying to cater to people who are all the way up here on the wide spectrum but she at least has a breaking point if you have a breaking point you can be part of the political conversation if you don't have a breaking point if you'll stand for anything or if you'll stand for nothing from Trump then you're not part of a rational political conversation user part of a pro Trump cult or an anti-trump cult and I'm not interested in having a conversation with either of those things okay before I get the things I like and things I hate first I want to say thank you to our sponsors over at Skillshare so you live in a very fluid world with regard to the job market it's not like you can be in a job for 20 years and expect

that I have ever seen in politics because what the hell I mean just like what in the world and as I said on Friday one of the problems with the Trump administration and one of the glories of the Trump administration is that if you duck out of the room for five minutes to take a dump you miss Laurey news cycles scarer Moochie has contributed to this in magical ways I do love a man who who called his book something like jumping over the rabbit hole and then said that he did that as a reference to Lewis and Carroll now Lewis Carroll Lewis and Carroll you know like the explorers of the Northwest Lewis and Clark but in any case it pretty amazing scaramouche is just the joy and since I now root for entertainment not just policy victory I'm starting to give up on policy decree unfortunately because I don't see this Congress being effective and I think this president needs to get his act together now that would only for entertainment scaramouche you must stay it is imperative that scaramouche you remain as part of this administration no matter how many times he says that other administration other administration officials are attempting to perform bizarre sex acts on themselves from SNL skits with Will Ferrell performing yoga in any case I've decided to do a whole series of references to Skinner Moochie this week in honor the new White House communications director that this one is basically eight versions of scaramouche II in a suit it is Wall Street the starting charleshayne in the 1980s Oliver Stone had a series of films that really quite good like back to back in the 1980s this is a film that he made directly after platoon and of course it's become famous for Michael Douglas's terrific performances Gordon Gekko I here's some of the trailer from a director of platoon the next battle is in the creative jungle of them all Wall Street it all down as I know time the stock is plummeting when it hits a teen idol something big is going down I want you to fill out the missing picture mr. Gekko that's not exactly what I do or you can create your honor it is no license that's inside information for power you're not inside you are outside I want you with advice with your trade your peace of mind just the beginning pound if any trouble does arise you are on your own the trail does stop with you pearl piece of the action and remain that money all it takes is a little inside information I don't care where I get it and thank you for my head you can trade everything you believe in is yours you can teach your blind to sit or everything you ever wanted I got a strange call from the FCC a very very enlightening challenge obviously the take on Wall Street is the wall stories all based on insider information which is not your personal there's a good libertarian argument that insider information should actually be legal the reason that they say this is because they say that otherwise what you end up with is that the public actually has less information generally you can follow a few key players and if you just followed what the investors were doing who actually are at the company you'd immediately know something was going wrong with the company and sell your stock so it actually be more transparent this is the case made by libertarians thanks actually a pretty strong case economically speaking that insider information shouldn't be barred because people are going to do it anyway and in fact the people with the ultimate insider information are people in Congress who know which legislation is going to be passed impacting the the economy in any case it's a really cynical take on Wall Street that is far too broad the truth is that the vast majority of stock pickers do not actually outperform the market one of the great myths of stock picking is that if you invest your money at goldman sachs the particular trader the bad guy is going to be just a wild success for the next ten years the number of people who have been wild successes who outperform the market you know who picked stocks just they're great at picking stocks really really low the market is a highly transparent and it is very difficult to beat the market the idea that you can you speak the market is you maybe may do it on one-off basis but doing it repeatedly is nearly impossible but the film itself is really good and it's funny because Gordon Gekko is supposed to be the villain but his greed is good speech which is basically sort of a 9r and take on economics not a bad summary of ein Ron's objectivism and actually true one of the things that's really funny about this is that they make out this movie I can do a whole think about the economics with its moving but they make out the unions as the great winners in all of us okay the unions in this case one of the things that happens in this movie is that the union which is run by Charlie Sheen's dad Martin Sheen in the film is trying to bargain with an airline the airline is losing money and the unions are still trying to claw for their piece now he makes the union's a lot more conciliatory then they actually are in real life but Gordon Gekko looks at this and he says okay well I'll buy the airline I'll gut the airline I can sell it off for pieces it's cheaper to do that and I'll make more money that way bargaining with these unions and instead of you saying well maybe the Union should cut a better deal with management in order for them to operate an airline in a competitive price right and stop losing money they makes you feel like he's the bad guy for coming in and buying a company and then and then redistributing the airplane basically selling the airplanes to more efficient companies but from the prop from perspective of the consumer what Gordon Gekko does is better from the perspective of the consumer than what the union is attempting to do in wall street it's really it's an interesting counter like if you watch and then dude the economic counter to it it's actually a really interesting analysis but it's kind of cool Oliver Stone who is a complete nutjob is he's super talented director he made in this period he made Salvador with James was which is a very good movie the next movie made was platoon which is a very good movie the next movie he made was Wall Street which is a very good movie movie made after that is talk radio which is a very good movie and they made born on the 4th of July which not a big fan of and the doors which I'm not having tonight in the mid JFK which again is propaganda but it's a very good movie talent is Andrew Clavin like to say talent Falls equally on the on the good and the evil Oliver Stone is not a good man who used back for years the who go Chavez regime in Venezuela which is now garbage but it's but it's pretty he is a talented filmmaker for sure okay time for some things that I hate okay so first thing that I hate there's this run in between chris Christie the Governor of New Jersey and a Cubs fan is in a Brewers Cubs game and Chris Christie is getting a lot of crap for this but that does not seem appropriate to me here's what happened that can bake with that own breakfast if I had sister she was walking through the Cubs fan started heckling him and he he yelled his name apparently the guy said I yelled his name and told him that he sucked I called him a hypocrite because I thought that it needed to be said and I think it's one thing for Chris Christie to catch a ball at a Mets game which I like the last weekend then he got booted which I was just generally hilarious but don't like harass the guy on a personal level okay like as somebody who is in public a lot it would be very irritating to me if you just heckled me on a personal level I I'm like I'll live with it it's fine it comes along with the territory but for people to be getting all over Christie because Christie went him and said you know you're you're a big shot before walking away from the fan I can't get on Chris Christie's case for that I really can't and people are all over him for it not so much okay the other thing that I hate today is JK Rowling people are so eager to nail Trump that they are just saying things about him that are plainly untrue so there was a video of it looked like a kid in a wheelchair trying to shake Trump 10 and then Trump not shaking his hand but the problem is that that's not true Trump spent more time with the kid in the wheelchair than anyone else is actual video of Trump with the kid in the wheelchair and it is not it's obvious that he's not ignoring the kid in the wheelchair but that didn't stop JK Rowling we actually we have the video so this is the actual video of Trump with the kid in the wheelchair so there's a cute local kid in the wheelchair and people are trying to suggest that Trump was ignoring the kid the kid want to handshake first of all kids like three kids were three don't handshake really but he was really nice to the kid JK rowling didn't stop her again when you are a big name author in a different field you feel the need to be a jerk I guess like Stephen King or JK Rowling she tweeted when someone shows you who they are believe them Maya Andrew first of all anyone who quotes Maya Angelou is just a complete bag of annoyance when someone come on and she says Trump imitated a disabled reporter now he pretends not to see a child in a wheelchair as though frightened he might catch his condition hey number one never happened number two on the invitation of disabled reporter this is one of those things where the more I watch and watch it now probably ten times so I think it's good know so I think that he was obviously imitating the reporter I don't think it's perfectly obvious at all because Trump does his imitation of like thing people he doesn't like the same way every time with this and the weird voice but in any case she says this monster of narcissism values only himself in his pale reflections the disabled minorities transgender people the poor women almost related to him by ties of blood and therefore his creations are treated with contempt because they do not resemble Trump my mother used a wheelchair I witnessed people uncomfortable around her disability but if they had a shred of decency they got over it so yes a clip of Trump looking deliberately over a disabled child's head ignoring his outstretched hand was touched me on the raw that man occupies the most powerful office in the free world and his daily outrages against civilized norms are having a corrosive effect how stunning and how horrible that Trump cannot bring himself to shake the hand of a small boy who only wanted to touch the president um yeah except that that's a bunch of absolute garbage that thing has 58 thousand retweets and Counting actually I'm sorry the first one with Maya Angelou is 160 mm likes so it just shows you how eager people are to confirm their biases about particular people including Trump listen you can be critical of Trump I'm highly critical of Trump but that does not mean you get to make crap up about him that makes you a bad person okay so we'll be back here tomorrow I'll use the full recap of the debate with Schenk we will have a bunch of clips at that point and I look forward to seeing you then I'm Ben Shapiro this is the venture Pierrot show
