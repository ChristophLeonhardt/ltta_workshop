For this Olympics, we
have 21 total suitcases.
They’re all the size
of Ford Focuses.
Small trucks.
Small trucks.
Because we want to
make sure that we’re
prepared for anything.
I mean, what if we get
sent to the mountains?
We’ve got to have
a boot for that.
What if we’re doing a solid
interview with the president
of somewhere?
We have to have a
brooch for that.
I feel like, when you’re
competing at the Olympics,
the costume that you wear has
to portray not only the music
and the story of
your choreography
but also who you are as a
person, what you’re all about,
what you feel beautiful in.
And of course, it has to
stretch and move with you.
I loved getting
into the character
of whatever I was skating to.
So I skated attached to
Anastasia, for example,
for my Olympic short program.
And I tried to copy her dress
as much as I could, just so you
feel like, when you
step on the ice,
this is a representation
of your entire performance.
Probably at 13 or
14, I really didn’t
know what my style would be.
It was mainly whatever
I wanted to wear.
When I was a teenager, my
style was very pop princess.
I was very into the Christina
Aguileras and 'N Syncs
of the world.
My style was definitely
a work in progress.
Yeah.
Mine was too.
I feel like I’m thinking
back to — remember
when Uggs with, like,
the jean skirt was in?
Were you still a
teenager for that?
Yeah.
I was.
That wasn't our time.
Yeah.
You’ve got to know
your face and your body
and your style and your vibe.
And I rocked those bangs.
And I was full.
And my mom cut them with
the Conair curling iron.
Remember where
you used to just —
Those were around
the world bangs.
Yep.
I feel like I credit my parents
to keeping me very grounded
and down to earth
and never feeling
like I should be
anything but who I was.
I grew up lower middle class
in the middle of nowhere
in Pennsylvania.
And my parents were both very
different from their families.
And they always talked
about the importance
of being who you are,
and if you are different,
celebrating that and being
as special as you can be,
because coming from a town like
I did, everyone’s the same.
It’s 99.9% white Christians
who may or may not
have had a close run in with a
cow at one point in their life.
And that’s where I come from.
So my mom was like,
Johnny, go be special.
Go do you.
So when I’m choosing the things
I wear or the things I say,
it all really does
come from the heart,
because that’s all I know.
I don’t know how
to create an image.
I don’t know how
to be premeditated.
And I don’t know
how or understand
why anybody would
want to lie just
for the sake of people thinking
better or worse of them.
I’m going to be who I am
from the time I wake up
to the time I go
to bed until I die.
And there’s nothing that’s
going to change that.
We like to provide our
viewers with an atmosphere.
It isn’t just, these are
the people that are talking,
and these are the
people that are skating.
Why not start off a show and
get people ready for what
they’re going to see?
We are Olympians.
So every Olympic cycle,
we start training as soon
as the Olympics are over.
So as soon as we get
the go-ahead and the O.K.
that we’re going
to work in Beijing,
we’re going to be preparing.
