said oh you fucked up I said but I still
don't think it exists because I never
made one he said because I played a part
of the third verse does it exist I said
you may have made a different song
because I know I made it and I started
elaborating so he gets it in his mind I
said that it's not the third verse ha that's a
different song you don't have a first or
second verse how can you have a third verse
he said no bro, I got a third verse and a fourth and a fifth and a sixth
at this point, I'm like what the f**k bro?
