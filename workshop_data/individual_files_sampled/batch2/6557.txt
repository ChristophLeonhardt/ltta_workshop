YouTube had to take down a video today that unfortunately for a brief period of time was the number one trending video on YouTube and that number one trending video spread helps spread this false narrative that the students who are protesting for better gun regulation are not in fact students from parkland Florida but that they are child actors who are just trying to stir the pot and who are paid by people like George Soros now in the video I didn't get a chance to look at it before it was taken down but it's been described as accusing david hog one of the more outspoken students of forgetting his rehearsed lines and it's all a lie it's all an effort to discredit and smear these students so we don't actually have real change in the country in regard to these gun laws now i could understand why youtube would take it down but jenk you have a different perspective yeah i don't think they should have taken it down and you know i'll tell you why is it garbage of course it is is it horribly untrue of course it is and so what do they do these all these conspiracy theorists do two things they just have to pick one other dot and then they say okay this happened and then this happened connect the dots so what's the dot in this case once david hog was in california and happened to be in a somehow in a video where he was involved with a lifeguard and so they're like aha he's not actually from floridays from california and then we were gonna make up a quote about how he want to always wanted to be an actor and whenever there's a crisis lifeguard shooting crisis he became a crisis actor and unfortunately there's a lot of gullible people mainly on the right tiny bit on the left but a lot of them in the country now way higher percentage that i would have expected to go uh-huh okay we have connected the dots no you haven't it turns out he was on vacation and in california and that happened it has nothing doing anything and no that could of course about him wanting to be an actor or Photoshop non-trivial yeah etc right so and come on have you no freaking decency and they don't so why do I argue that they shouldn't have taken it down because look look at YouTube it's filled with conspiracy theories and where do you draw the line so okay you can say all right then I got to take down in four simple Wars a huge channel littered it's littered with conspiracy theories yeah so where's the downside I don't get it nothing but upside so far continue okay so look a lot of people believe in him a lot of people believe in its political ideology look I think you're insane if you believe that there are 80 percent human 80 percent grill 80 percent pig hybrids and that the frogs are gay or because of the water or the Pepsi or whatever he believes right allow me allow me to be absolutely clear in what I think where I draw the line okay so let me pick someone who I disagree with often but I wouldn't want to ban them from anything including YouTube ben shapiro don't agree with him on 98% of the things that he says probably but I would never want to ban him because he's an honest actor do you see what I'm saying yeah barely but yes you know what I mean like he's not as far as I know ben shapiro doesn't go out of his way to intentionally defame people and smear them because that's what Infowars does they mess with people's lives they mess with people's reputation but anna is a super hard line to draw so if you go to Ben's website so 99% of the city used to be 97 now it's 99 percent of the world scientists agree that climate change is real and it's Man right right and he will twist that you will find one thing that is the makes up a thing about how no in fact 97% of the world's scientists don't agree or you know go look at it you're don't don't waste your time but so ok it's not a conspiracy theory but it is wildly misrepresent of and Ben is smart enough to know that he's obviously misrepresenting what the scientists and it's it's we're dealing with a stat a sad state of affairs where it's like yes I get it like giving him a pass it seems like you're you're yet having a double standard there but understand what I'm saying here what I'm saying is that there is a big difference between the Ben Shapiro's of the world who might twist the data to fit their agenda and the people who peddle conspiracy theories like pizza gate for instance right that's where people are either defamed to the point where their reputations could be destroyed right ruining their lives or it could lead to actual violence it could incite violence in this case we're talking about kids these people aren't even adults yet they're children and they're being smeared by these right wing lunatics and who knows what kind of danger might come their way because of these types of videos that's the thing that I worry about no I understand that Anna but I looked I wouldn't let you draw the line but it doesn't really matter because you're not gonna be the one drawing the line you know who's gonna draw the line eventually the establishment and the establishment is not going to draw it where you draw it and you might draw it at a reasonable place but you know what they're gonna say and they're saying it now and they're putting all the pressure in the world on YouTube and in in in this store every saqqaq on YouTube allows this another disaster ok so obviously not only do I not agree with it I know it's fake I all this stuff and we fight against it tooth and nail every single day but then they will say well I kind of don't like your opinion either I know and yes it is a slippery slope and it's scary but I will also say this what are we gonna do like what are we gonna do because at this point I feel like anything that that we do is a wasted effort because Americans have absolutely no media literacy whatsoever none none they fall victim to all sorts of propaganda and I'm not just talking about propaganda from foreign bad actors I'm talking about propaganda from here the United States of America they will fall for anything I see all sorts of nonsense shared on my social media feeds on a regular basis where the most crazy accusations the the biggest lunatic peddling the most ridiculous conspiracy theory is taken seriously they'll have hundreds thousands of views my own friends and family members will share it on their feet because Americans have no media literacy that's the reason why it's so easy for you know foreign countries to get involved and spread divisive content here I know but look so Libya so what's the answer what do we do I don't know so first of all you cannot fix all of humanity so and you're not gonna curtail it by taking some freedoms away now look I don't think freedoms are unlimited so I'm not in the camp of the Second Amendment is unlimited etc right but but in terms of political speech it is super important to allow it even though it allows the monsters to spread their lies and Center first of all is it just America as hell no you go to any country huge chunks of the country believe in massive conspiracy theories right so it is partly in our nature because we we can't it's hard for us to figure out the universe so by the way there's a conspiracy theory that a guy walked on water was born of a virgin and then converts water and no twine and billions of people believe that there's another conspiracy theory that a guy talked to Allah on a mountaintop and then Allah told them to have sex with everybody's wives okay and a billion and a 1.6 billion people believe that so we can't stop people believing wrong things I'll tell you right now the minute you allow for that they're gonna come for all of us and look let's see even talk about conspiracy theories one of the theories that are put in a conspiracy theory bucket is the JFK assassination no the conspiracy is that a bullet zigzags in midair that's insanity but the establishment has declared that it is the truth so that is not remotely true the RFK thing is not remotely true but then under that rubric you're banned from ever discussing that that is really dangerous so these guys are dangerous but the opposite I think is even worse okay so the only way to do it is to keep on fighting them and I know it's a long hard Jenk and we're losing we're losing we're losing let's keep it real really is this short term yes Donald Trump is in office I'm not just talking about Donald Trump I'm talking about the way Americans think the way Americans act I'm talking about our disarmed minority and Trump won the election with a minority look in the I know that it is really hard not to get Scourge and i know it's really hard to believe in the long term but in the long term what's gonna happen yes some percentage of people will believe nonsense no matter what they believed it even before there was the internet in YouTube right but in the end a lot of people will go you know what I and I've seen this happen with my own eyes hundreds of times people emailing texting telling me in person I used to believe in then I was like wow that's really weird well that was wrong well I know that what is wrong oh well I don't and then people realize eventually that these a lot of these right-wing websites and and channels are garbage so at some point lie after lie after lie that you say okay let me just move on to things that are true and so and then we can agree or disagree as long as we're on the same planet and we're agree on what the facts are then we could have our different opinions so look the New York Times is doing great now now you could argue that they have an establishment bias etc etc but at least people are saying I'm going to go subscribe to them because I at least trust them so people in the long run will gravitate towards things that they trust and you got to earn that trust through years and years and after burning people's trust over and over again they will lose most of the people not all the people but most of the people so because and and the alternative of trying to enforce our opinions or some other establishment figures opinions on everyone else I think is a terrible lie but understand that that is not what I'm advocating for I am advocating for taking down content that is specifically defamatory with the intention of smearing and discrediting people that whoever made the video disagrees with that is around talk I'm not talking about establishment Pro establishment versus anti-establishment opinion I'm not even talking about opinion I am talking about people who intentionally smear others and defame others and especially in this case where there are kids involved okay great point Anna so if they have breakin broken the law in some demonstrable way so if Alex Jones thinks that the frogs are gay it doesn't matter they're not people nobody cares about you D framing the defaming of frogs or you believe in your hybrids your lizard people it doesn't matter but if you call someone a lizard person or you know it's someone in particular and you defame them in a way that is provable etc and you say well okay now that's a violation of law and you should take action there than I would agree with you because it is specifically targeting people and spreading lies about that's right if you like this video bless your heart we got a lot more where that came
