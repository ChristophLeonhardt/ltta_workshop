1
00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:04,910
These are 3 red wines that are made from the same grape, but at different prices.

2
00:00:04,910 --> 00:00:08,900
The most expensive: a 2011Honig cabernet sauvignon

3
00:00:08,900 --> 00:00:15,459
from Napa Valley. Wine Spectator magazine
rated it Outstanding. And it cost 5 times more than

4
00:00:15,459 --> 00:00:19,739
the one on the right.
So does it taste 5 times better?

5
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:29,940
19 Vox staffers tasted and rated each of the
wines. And almost half of them correctly identified

6
00:00:29,950 --> 00:00:33,820
the most expensive one. But that’s
not because they liked it more.

7
00:00:33,820 --> 00:00:36,740
"Very nuanced. Complex. Didn't enjoy it."

8
00:00:36,740 --> 00:00:41,660
The average ratings of the cheapest and most
expensive wine were actually the same.

9
00:00:41,660 --> 00:00:45,820
"I'm glad I have cheap taste. That's going to make my life really easy."

10
00:00:45,820 --> 00:00:51,100
And this is consistent with a 2008 study
that compiled 6,000 blind tastings in the

11
00:00:51,100 --> 00:00:55,899
US. It found that unless they had undergone
wine training, people didn’t actually prefer the

12
00:00:55,899 --> 00:01:00,159
taste of more expensive wines. In fact they
enjoyed them slightly less.

13
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:01,780
"Yeah, that's really not very pleasant."

14
00:01:01,780 --> 00:01:04,720
There seems to be something about wine that can make us feel a bit lost.

15
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:06,720
“That has sort of an oaky afterbirth."

16
00:01:07,940 --> 00:01:11,520
That’s probably why a single
movie can move the whole wine market.

17
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:16,069
“That's tasty.” “That’s 100% pinot
noir. Single vineyard. They don’t even make

18
00:01:16,069 --> 00:01:18,590
it anymore.”
After Sideways was released, sales of Pinot

19
00:01:18,590 --> 00:01:22,189
Noir jumped up compared to other red wines.
And sales of merlot?

20
00:01:22,189 --> 00:01:25,789
“I’m not drinking any f*cking merlot.”
They slowed down.

21
00:01:25,789 --> 00:01:31,279
But who decides what good wine is? 
Professional judges give medals in wine competitions,

22
00:01:31,279 --> 00:01:35,590
but they’re really inconsistent
One statistician showed that most wines that

23
00:01:35,590 --> 00:01:40,509
received the highest score in one 
competition also got the lowest score in another.

24
00:01:40,509 --> 00:01:44,349
This is the distribution of gold medals that
you would expect if they were awarded by random

25
00:01:44,349 --> 00:01:50,569
chance. It looks a lot like the actual distribution
of gold medals entered in US wine competitions.

26
00:01:50,569 --> 00:01:55,109
That suggests judges often disagree with each
other. But it gets worse: they often disagree

27
00:01:55,109 --> 00:02:00,679
with themselves. When surreptitiously given
the same wine 3 times, only 1 in 10 of the

28
00:02:00,679 --> 00:02:05,929
judges at the California State Fair wine competition
consistently awarded it the same medal.

29
00:02:05,929 --> 00:02:10,598
Wine ratings published in magazines can be
all over the map too. Here’s how two of

30
00:02:10,598 --> 00:02:13,549
the top critics described the same wine in
2004.

31
00:02:13,549 --> 00:02:19,209
“A brilliant effort”  “completely unappetizing”
“a wine of sublime richness” “overripe

32
00:02:19,209 --> 00:02:24,099
aromas” “remarkable freshness and definition”
“more reminiscent of a late-harvest zinfandel

33
00:02:24,099 --> 00:02:29,180
than a red bordeaux.”
One problem is that not all wine publications

34
00:02:29,180 --> 00:02:33,409
require tasters to be blind to the price
and the brand.

35
00:02:33,409 --> 00:02:38,329
And that matters because people can’t seem
to avoid associating price with quality.

36
00:02:38,329 --> 00:02:42,079
One experiment in Australia showed that people
rated the same wine higher when they thought

37
00:02:42,079 --> 00:02:48,840
it was $53 rather than $16 or $6. But get
this - the experimenters had actually made that wine

38
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:54,370
objectively worse by adding tartaric acid.
It didn’t matter -- the price tag overwhelmed

39
00:02:54,370 --> 00:02:57,689
their own taste buds.
In another study, scientists scanned the brains

40
00:02:57,689 --> 00:03:02,290
of people tasting wines they thought were
either $10 or $90. In reality, it was the

41
00:03:02,290 --> 00:03:08,030
same wine, but when they thought it was expensive,
their brains showed more activity in a region

42
00:03:08,030 --> 00:03:10,379
associated with pleasant tastes
and smells.

43
00:03:10,379 --> 00:03:16,199
so expensive wines may actually taste better after
all, as long as you know that they’re expensive.

44
00:03:16,199 --> 00:00:00,000
"You can feel free to finish it if you want." "I'll take the expensive one."
