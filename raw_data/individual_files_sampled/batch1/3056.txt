in your statement you said that you and the FBI leadership team decided not to discuss the president's actions with attorney general sessions even though he had not recused himself what was it about the Attorney General's own interactions with the Russians or his behavior with regard to the investigation that would have led the entire leadership of the FBI to make this decision our judgment as I recall was that he was very close to and inevitably going to recuse himself for a variety of reasons we also were aware of facts that I can't discuss in an open setting that would make his continued engagement in a Russia related investigation problematic and so we were we were convinced in fact I think we had already heard that the career people were recommending that he recused himself that he was not going to be in contact with Russia related matters much longer and that turned out to be the case
