1
00:00:12,581 --> 00:00:13,282
>> Martha: BREAKING TONIGHT,

2
00:00:13,282 --> 00:00:14,016
PRESIDENT TRUMP ON OP ED SAID

3
00:00:14,016 --> 00:00:15,117
THAT HE TOLD HIS DEPUTY ATTORNEY

4
00:00:15,117 --> 00:00:16,385
GENERAL ROD ROSENSTEIN WHAT TO

5
00:00:16,385 --> 00:00:17,552
SAY IN A CRUCIAL MEMO THAT

6
00:00:17,552 --> 00:00:20,956
PLAYED A ROLE IN THE FIRING OF

7
00:00:20,956 --> 00:00:21,590
JAMES COMEY.

8
00:00:21,590 --> 00:00:23,558
TELLING FOX NEWS THAT

9
00:00:23,558 --> 00:00:24,393
PRESIDENT TRUMP WANTED HIM TO

10
00:00:24,393 --> 00:00:25,861
MAKE IT CLEAR THAT HE WAS NOT

11
00:00:25,861 --> 00:00:27,162
UNDER INVESTIGATION IN THE

12
00:00:27,162 --> 00:00:27,763
RUSSIA PROBE.

13
00:00:27,763 --> 00:00:29,398
BACK TO THAT TODAY TWEETING THAT

14
00:00:29,398 --> 00:00:33,135
RUSSIA HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH

15
00:00:33,135 --> 00:00:34,736
THE COMEY FIRING, FIRING ANDREW

16
00:00:34,736 --> 00:00:36,104
McCABE, WRITING A MEMO AS IT

17
00:00:36,104 --> 00:00:38,006
WAS HAPPENING, AND NOW THAT MEMO

18
00:00:38,006 --> 00:00:39,341
WAS IN THE HANDS OF ROBERT

19
00:00:39,341 --> 00:00:39,675
MUELLER.

20
00:00:39,675 --> 00:00:42,344
HERE NOW JONATHAN TURLEY,

21
00:00:42,344 --> 00:00:42,978
WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY LAW

22
00:00:42,978 --> 00:00:44,413
PROFESSOR TO REACT TO THAT,

23
00:00:44,413 --> 00:00:47,950
JONATHAN, GOOD TO SEE YOU.

24
00:00:47,950 --> 00:00:49,818
SO WHAT IS THE SIGNIFICANCE OF

25
00:00:49,818 --> 00:00:50,752
THE McCABE MEMO THAT HE WROTE

26
00:00:50,752 --> 00:00:52,454
AND TURNED OVER?

27
00:00:52,454 --> 00:00:54,556
>> IT IS HARD TO SAY, I THINK

28
00:00:54,556 --> 00:00:56,758
THAT ULTIMATELY IT MAY SAY MORE

29
00:00:56,758 --> 00:00:57,459
ABOUT THE McCABE'S MIND-SET

30
00:00:57,459 --> 00:00:59,761
THAN THE PRESIDENTS.

31
00:00:59,761 --> 00:01:01,964
THE PRESIDENT WAS CLEAR, HE TOLD

32
00:01:01,964 --> 00:01:03,665
EVERYBODY FROM THE FBI DIRECTOR

33
00:01:03,665 --> 00:01:05,767
TO HIS BARBER THAT HE WANTED IT

34
00:01:05,767 --> 00:01:07,636
TO BE MADE PUBLIC THAT HE WAS

35
00:01:07,636 --> 00:01:09,738
NOT A TARGET OR SUBJECT OF THE

36
00:01:09,738 --> 00:01:10,172
INVESTIGATION.

37
00:01:10,172 --> 00:01:11,139
HE HAD BEEN VERY CONSISTENT

38
00:01:11,139 --> 00:01:12,174
ABOUT THAT.

39
00:01:12,174 --> 00:01:14,343
ALL OF THE WITNESSES HAVE SAID

40
00:01:14,343 --> 00:01:14,977
THAT.

41
00:01:14,977 --> 00:01:17,012
IT IS NOT TOO SURPRISING THAT HE

42
00:01:17,012 --> 00:01:19,314
SUGGESTED THE SAME MANTRA.

43
00:01:19,314 --> 00:01:20,549
IT MIGHT BE AN OBSESSION TO BE

44
00:01:20,549 --> 00:01:23,218
SURE, BUT IT IS NOT A COVER

45
00:01:23,218 --> 00:01:23,752
STORY.

46
00:01:23,752 --> 00:01:25,253
AT LEAST FOR PEOPLE LOOKING AT

47
00:01:25,253 --> 00:01:26,355
IT OBJECTIVELY.

48
00:01:26,355 --> 00:01:28,256
IF McCABE WROTE THE MEMO,

49
00:01:28,256 --> 00:01:29,358
BECAUSE HE FELT THAT THE

50
00:01:29,358 --> 00:01:30,559
PRESIDENT WAS TRYING TO CREATE A

51
00:01:30,559 --> 00:01:32,427
COVER STORY, IT DOES RAISE THE

52
00:01:32,427 --> 00:01:35,163
QUESTION HOW McCABE VIEWED THE

53
00:01:35,163 --> 00:01:36,498
PRESIDENT AND HIS MOTIVATION.

54
00:01:36,498 --> 00:01:37,532
SO THE MEMO MAY SAY A LOT ABOUT

55
00:01:37,532 --> 00:01:40,369
BOTH MEN.

56
00:01:40,369 --> 00:01:41,436
>> Martha: HERE IS ONE OF THE

57
00:01:41,436 --> 00:01:42,137
TWEETS THAT THE PRESIDENT PUT

58
00:01:42,137 --> 00:01:45,540
OUT TODAY.

59
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:47,309
"NOT THAT IT MATTERS, BUT I

60
00:01:47,309 --> 00:01:48,643
NEVER FIRED JAMES COMEY BECAUSE

61
00:01:48,643 --> 00:01:49,611
OF RUSSIA.

62
00:01:49,611 --> 00:01:50,278
THE CORRUPT MAINSTREAM MEDIA

63
00:01:50,278 --> 00:01:51,346
LOVES TO PUSH THE NARRATIVE, BUT

64
00:01:51,346 --> 00:01:56,585
THEY KNOW IT IS NOT TRUE.

65
00:01:56,585 --> 00:01:58,120
"WHAT EVERYBODY TOOK OFF WAS A

66
00:01:58,120 --> 00:02:00,722
SOUND BITE FROM NBC BACK IN

67
00:02:00,722 --> 00:02:01,923
2017.

68
00:02:01,923 --> 00:02:04,326
>> AND IN FACT WHEN I DECIDED TO

69
00:02:04,326 --> 00:02:06,828
JUST DO IT, I SAID TO MYSELF, I

70
00:02:06,828 --> 00:02:09,531
SAID, YOU KNOW, THIS RUSSIA

71
00:02:09,531 --> 00:02:11,433
THING WITH TRUMP-RUSSIA IS A

72
00:02:11,433 --> 00:02:13,268
MADE UP STORY, IT IS AN EXCUSE

73
00:02:13,268 --> 00:02:15,570
BY THE DEMOCRATS LOSING AN

74
00:02:15,570 --> 00:02:17,139
ELECTION.

75
00:02:17,139 --> 00:02:18,040
>> Martha: JONATHAN TURLEY,

76
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:20,409
THE QUESTION IS, IF THAT WAS IN

77
00:02:20,409 --> 00:02:22,477
HIS MIND THAT HE WANTED ROD

78
00:02:22,477 --> 00:02:24,279
ROSENSTEIN TO SAY THAT HE WAS

79
00:02:24,279 --> 00:02:25,080
NOT UNDER INVESTIGATION, WE KNOW

80
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:27,516
THAT THAT WAS STUCK IN HIS CLAW

81
00:02:27,516 --> 00:02:29,985
THAT HE WANTED JAMES COMEY TO

82
00:02:29,985 --> 00:02:31,520
SAY THAT AS WELL.

83
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:33,455
IS THERE ANYTHING ILLEGAL ABOUT

84
00:02:33,455 --> 00:02:33,922
THAT?

85
00:02:33,922 --> 00:02:35,190
OR IS THAT OBSTRUCTION IN ANY

86
00:02:35,190 --> 00:02:37,059
WAY IN OF ITSELF?

87
00:02:37,059 --> 00:02:39,528
>> TWO-POINT SHOULD BE MADE,

88
00:02:39,528 --> 00:02:40,929
OBVIOUSLY THIS WAS SELF

89
00:02:40,929 --> 00:02:41,897
IMMOLATION, I DO NOT UNDERSTAND

90
00:02:41,897 --> 00:02:43,532
WHY THE PRESIDENT WOULD SAY

91
00:02:43,532 --> 00:02:43,832
THAT.

92
00:02:43,832 --> 00:02:45,567
BUT IN FAIRNESS TO HIM, HE WENT

93
00:02:45,567 --> 00:02:47,302
ON IN THE SAME INTERVIEW AND HE

94
00:02:47,302 --> 00:02:50,739
SAID, I UNDERSTAND BY FIRING

95
00:02:50,739 --> 00:02:51,840
COMEY, I'M LIKELY TO PROLONG

96
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:52,974
THIS INVESTIGATION.

97
00:02:52,974 --> 00:02:54,109
HE ALSO INDICATED THAT HE

98
00:02:54,109 --> 00:02:54,876
UNDERSTOOD THE INVESTIGATION HAD

99
00:02:54,876 --> 00:02:57,512
TO RUN ITS COURSE.

100
00:02:57,512 --> 00:02:59,114
COMEY SAID THAT THE PRESIDENT

101
00:02:59,114 --> 00:03:00,282
AGREED WITH HIM THAT THE

102
00:03:00,282 --> 00:03:01,583
INVESTIGATION SHOULD RUN ITS

103
00:03:01,583 --> 00:03:01,917
COURSE.

104
00:03:01,917 --> 00:03:03,118
SO THE RHETORIC IS NOT AS CLEAR

105
00:03:03,118 --> 00:03:05,153
AS PEOPLE MAKE IT OUT TO BE.

106
00:03:05,153 --> 00:03:07,489
BUT IN TERMS OF OBSTRUCTION, I

107
00:03:07,489 --> 00:03:09,958
THINK THAT THERE IS NO CREDIBLE

108
00:03:09,958 --> 00:03:11,059
EVIDENCE BASED ON THE COMEY

109
00:03:11,059 --> 00:03:13,161
FIRING TO MAKE OUT A CRIMINAL

110
00:03:13,161 --> 00:03:13,495
CHARGE.

111
00:03:13,495 --> 00:03:16,765
THERE WERE PLENTY OF REASONS FOR

112
00:03:16,765 --> 00:03:18,733
TRUMP TO FIRE COMEY.

113
00:03:18,733 --> 00:03:20,535
THE ROSENSTEIN LETTER REVEALS

114
00:03:20,535 --> 00:03:23,138
WHAT EVERYBODY ALREADY KNOWS,

115
00:03:23,138 --> 00:03:25,140
WHICH IS THE REPUBLICANS AND

116
00:03:25,140 --> 00:03:26,508
DEMOCRATS ALIKE, FORMER JUSTICE

117
00:03:26,508 --> 00:03:28,143
OFFICIAL FELT THAT HE SHOULD BE

118
00:03:28,143 --> 00:03:29,144
FIRED.

119
00:03:29,144 --> 00:03:30,445
HE HAD A PERFECTLY VALID REASON

120
00:03:30,445 --> 00:03:32,347
TO DO SO.

121
00:03:32,347 --> 00:03:33,348
THE STATEMENT OBVIOUSLY IT HAS

122
00:03:33,348 --> 00:03:34,749
COST HIM A GREAT DEAL, BUT I DO

123
00:03:34,749 --> 00:03:35,984
NOT THINK THAT IT MAKES OUT A

124
00:03:35,984 --> 00:03:38,120
CASE FOR OBSTRUCTION.

125
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:38,854
>> Martha: REALLY ALL DEPENDS

126
00:03:38,854 --> 00:03:41,156
IN THE END, WE ARE ALL WAITING

127
00:03:41,156 --> 00:03:41,857
FOR THE REPORT FROM ROBERT

128
00:03:41,857 --> 00:03:42,691
MUELLER AND HOW HE INTERPRETS

129
00:03:42,691 --> 00:03:43,625
IT.

130
00:03:43,625 --> 00:03:44,326
BUT ACCORDING TO THE STORIES,

131
00:03:44,326 --> 00:03:47,729
THERE IS A BREATHLESS STORY OF

132
00:03:47,729 --> 00:03:48,663
US IN THE DAY THAT PUSHES

133
00:03:48,663 --> 00:03:49,931
FORWARD THE NARRATIVE INTEREST

134
00:03:49,931 --> 00:03:52,167
TO GET INTO THE MIND OF ROBERT

135
00:03:52,167 --> 00:03:52,901
MUELLER HOW HE IS INTERPRETING

136
00:03:52,901 --> 00:03:53,301
ALL OF THIS.

137
00:03:53,301 --> 00:03:55,670
BUT THE BOTTOM LINE IS, THAT WE

138
00:03:55,670 --> 00:03:56,972
DO NOT KNOW HOW HE IS

139
00:03:56,972 --> 00:03:57,672
INTERPRETING ALL OF THIS.

140
00:03:57,672 --> 00:03:59,207
>> I THINK THAT THAT IS

141
00:03:59,207 --> 00:03:59,741
ABSOLUTELY RIGHT.

142
00:03:59,741 --> 00:04:02,744
I CAN TELL YOU THAT FROM A

143
00:04:02,744 --> 00:04:04,346
CRIMINAL DEFENSE STANDPOINT,

144
00:04:04,346 --> 00:04:05,046
PEOPLE ARE FOOLING THEMSELVES

145
00:04:05,046 --> 00:04:07,415
WHEN THEY SAY, BELIEVE THAT THE

146
00:04:07,415 --> 00:04:08,984
COMEY FIRING ALONE WOULD BE THE

147
00:04:08,984 --> 00:04:11,586
BASIS OF AN OBSTRUCTION CASE.

148
00:04:11,586 --> 00:04:12,988
MOREOVER, THE PRESIDENT HAS A

149
00:04:12,988 --> 00:04:15,590
GOOD BASIS TO ARGUE, EVEN HIS

150
00:04:15,590 --> 00:04:16,690
PROBLEMS WITH JEFF SESSIONS DID

151
00:04:16,690 --> 00:04:17,591
NOT AMOUNT TO OBSTRUCTION.

152
00:04:17,591 --> 00:04:19,394
I THINK THAT HE IS WRONG ABOUT

153
00:04:19,394 --> 00:04:19,995
JEFF SESSIONS.

154
00:04:19,995 --> 00:04:21,196
I THINK THAT JEFF SESSIONS TOOK

155
00:04:21,196 --> 00:04:22,230
THE RIGHT STEP.

156
00:04:22,230 --> 00:04:24,666
I THINK THAT THAT WAS THE

157
00:04:24,666 --> 00:04:25,834
ETHICAL COURSE TO TAKE.

158
00:04:25,834 --> 00:04:27,135
BUT THE PRESIDENT CAN SAY THAT

159
00:04:27,135 --> 00:04:29,771
HE FELT THAT THE FBI WAS HOSTILE

160
00:04:29,771 --> 00:04:30,138
TERRITORY.

161
00:04:30,138 --> 00:04:31,339
AND THAT'S WHEN HE CAME INTO

162
00:04:31,339 --> 00:04:32,541
OFFICE AND FOUND OUT THAT THE

163
00:04:32,541 --> 00:04:33,575
FBI WAS INVESTIGATING HIM, HE

164
00:04:33,575 --> 00:04:35,177
WANTED TO HAVE ONE OF HIS OWN

165
00:04:35,177 --> 00:04:37,646
PEOPLE AT THE TOP OF THAT

166
00:04:37,646 --> 00:04:38,513
INVESTIGATION.

167
00:04:38,513 --> 00:04:39,714
NOW, THAT DOES NOT MAKE FOR

168
00:04:39,714 --> 00:04:40,715
OBSTRUCTION.

169
00:04:40,715 --> 00:00:00,000
HE MAY BE BAD JUDGMENT ON HIS
