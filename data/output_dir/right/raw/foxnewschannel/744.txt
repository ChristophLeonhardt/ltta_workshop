1
00:00:06,356 --> 00:00:07,789
THE RESTAURANT.

2
00:00:07,790 --> 00:00:10,525
I DID NOT CREATE THAT.

3
00:00:10,526 --> 00:00:16,265
>> AUTHOR OF THE NEW BOOK "THE

4
00:00:16,265 --> 00:00:17,833
BRIEFING" AND ARI FLEISCHER,

5
00:00:17,834 --> 00:00:18,500
ALSO A FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR.

6
00:00:18,501 --> 00:00:20,102
YOU HAVE BOTH BEEN IN SARAH

7
00:00:20,103 --> 00:00:21,837
SANDERS' SHOES AND WORK FOR

8
00:00:21,838 --> 00:00:22,571
ADMINISTRATIONS THAT AT TIMES

9
00:00:22,572 --> 00:00:24,806
WERE UNDER PRESSURE FOR VARIOUS

10
00:00:24,807 --> 00:00:25,274
THINGS.

11
00:00:25,275 --> 00:00:29,344
SEAN, HAVE YOU EVER SEEN

12
00:00:29,345 --> 00:00:46,862
ANYTHING LIKE THIS?

13
00:00:46,863 --> 00:00:46,995
ANYTHING LIKE THIS?

14
00:00:46,996 --> 00:00:47,663
>> I HAD A COUPLE UNPLEASANT

15
00:00:47,664 --> 00:00:48,397
INTERACTIONS BUT NEVER ANYTHING

16
00:00:48,398 --> 00:00:49,131
TO THE EXTENT THAT WE ARE SEEING

17
00:00:49,132 --> 00:00:49,398
NOW.

18
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:51,400
TRADITION OF PEOPLE BEING ABLE

19
00:00:51,401 --> 00:00:52,134
TO EXPRESS THEMSELVES PEACEFULLY

20
00:00:52,135 --> 00:00:52,768
AND CIVILLY, RESPECTFULLY.

21
00:00:52,769 --> 00:00:53,502
EVEN AT TIMES, ON RESPECTFULLY,

22
00:00:54,771 --> 00:00:55,470
MARCH TOWARDS A LITTLE BIT OF

23
00:00:55,471 --> 00:00:56,171
VIOLENCE IS WHAT IS EXTREMELY

24
00:01:01,544 --> 00:01:03,512
WHEN MAXINE WATERS SAID IT, YOU

25
00:01:03,513 --> 00:01:04,546
SHOULD PUSH BACK ON THEM, CREATE

26
00:01:04,547 --> 00:01:06,748
A CROWD AND YOU PUSH BACK ON

27
00:01:06,749 --> 00:01:08,183
THEM, I THINK THAT'S VERY

28
00:01:08,184 --> 00:01:09,184
TROUBLING.

29
00:01:09,185 --> 00:01:11,219
THE IDEA OF SEEMINGLY USING

30
00:01:11,220 --> 00:01:12,821
FORCE TO HURT SOMEBODY, YOU HAVE

31
00:01:12,822 --> 00:01:15,290
SEEN PEOPLE GO AND NOW MAKE THIS

32
00:01:15,291 --> 00:01:16,391
PERSONAL, GOING TO THEIR PLACES

33
00:01:16,392 --> 00:01:17,893
OF BUSINESS, PLACES WHERE THEY

34
00:01:17,894 --> 00:01:18,327
ARE EATING.

35
00:01:18,328 --> 00:01:19,795
IT'S NOT JUST A THREAT TO THEM

36
00:01:19,796 --> 00:01:22,130
BUT A THREAT TO THEIR FAMILIES

37
00:01:22,131 --> 00:01:23,665
AND A THREAT TO THOSE AROUND

38
00:01:23,666 --> 00:01:24,199
THEM.

39
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:25,400
MY THOUGHT, I MIGHT REMIND YOU

40
00:01:25,401 --> 00:01:27,202
THAT IT WAS A YEAR AGO THAT AN

41
00:01:27,203 --> 00:01:28,870
ACTIVIST ON THE LEFT TOOK THIS

42
00:01:28,871 --> 00:01:30,872
TO A WHOLE NEW LEVEL AND WENT

43
00:01:35,244 --> 00:01:38,914
INCLUDING STEVE SCALISE WAS

44
00:01:38,915 --> 00:01:39,548
SHOT, ONLY BECAUSE OF HIS

45
00:01:39,549 --> 00:01:40,916
POLITICAL BELIEFS.

46
00:01:40,917 --> 00:01:42,551
WE HAVE STARTED TO SEE THAT

47
00:01:42,552 --> 00:01:43,852
CREEP BACK INTO THE DIALOG AGAIN

48
00:01:43,853 --> 00:01:45,921
IN A VERY SCARY AND TROUBLING

49
00:01:45,922 --> 00:01:48,924
WAY AND IT'S GOT TO STOP.

50
00:01:48,925 --> 00:01:50,592
>> I THINK THERE IS A CUT

51
00:01:50,593 --> 00:01:51,326
LEGITIMATE CONCERN THAT SOMEONE

52
00:01:51,327 --> 00:01:54,596
COULD GET HURT IN ALL OF THIS.

53
00:01:54,597 --> 00:01:55,931
IT'S NOT A GAME.

54
00:02:01,537 --> 00:02:04,206
THIS WHOLE SCENARIO, IT IS

55
00:02:04,207 --> 00:02:06,842
FRIGHTENING.

56
00:02:06,843 --> 00:02:07,943
THIS IS ELYSE JORDAN TALKING

57
00:02:07,944 --> 00:02:10,112
ABOUT IT THIS MORNING.

58
00:02:10,113 --> 00:02:12,514
>> SHOULD SOMEONE WHO LIES

59
00:02:12,515 --> 00:02:15,117
CONSTANTLY AND ENABLES THE

60
00:02:15,118 --> 00:02:17,319
PRESIDENT'S LIES BE OPENLY

61
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:18,353
WELCOMED INTO SOCIETY, WHEREVER

62
00:02:18,354 --> 00:02:19,554
THEY PLEASE?

63
00:02:19,555 --> 00:02:21,490
SHOULD THEY FACE ANY KIND OF

64
00:02:21,491 --> 00:02:24,760
SOCIAL OR SOCIETAL PRESSURE?

65
00:02:24,761 --> 00:02:25,427
I AM INCREASINGLY WEIGHING

66
00:02:25,428 --> 00:02:33,335
TOWARDS A "YES" ."

67
00:02:33,336 --> 00:02:34,336
>> Martha: RE?

68
00:02:34,337 --> 00:02:35,904
>> OH, MY GOD.

69
00:02:35,905 --> 00:02:37,439
THERE'S ENOUGH IN THIS SOCIETY,

70
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:40,809
YOU DON'T ENGAGE IN THOSE TYPES

71
00:02:40,810 --> 00:02:42,444
OF PRACTICES.

72
00:02:42,445 --> 00:02:43,145
AND, MAXINE BASICALLY DENIED

73
00:02:43,146 --> 00:02:45,113
THAT SHE CALLED ON PEOPLE TO

74
00:02:45,114 --> 00:02:46,548
HARASS OTHERS.

75
00:02:46,549 --> 00:02:47,949
NO PEACE, NO REST.

76
00:02:47,950 --> 00:02:50,552
SO SHE IS STILL STICKING BY WHAT

77
00:02:50,553 --> 00:02:51,253
SHE HAS DONE.

78
00:02:51,254 --> 00:02:54,156
NOW SENATOR SCHUMER TO HIS

79
00:02:54,157 --> 00:02:55,290
CREDIT, THE DEMOCRAT MINORITY

80
00:02:55,291 --> 00:02:56,358
LEADER WENT DOWN TO THE FLOOR OF

81
00:02:56,359 --> 00:02:58,660
THE SENATE AND REALLY CONDEMNED

82
00:02:58,661 --> 00:02:58,927
HER.

83
00:02:58,928 --> 00:03:02,531
NANCY PELOSI PUT A MILQUETOAST

84
00:03:02,532 --> 00:03:03,732
ACCOMMODATION OF MAXINE WATERS.

85
00:03:03,733 --> 00:03:04,966
BUT THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES

86
00:03:04,967 --> 00:03:06,768
WHERE SHE SERVES, DO YOU NEED TO

87
00:03:06,769 --> 00:03:07,135
GET ASKED?

88
00:03:07,136 --> 00:03:10,939
THE PRESS NEEDS TO HAVE A

89
00:03:10,940 --> 00:03:13,408
FEEDING FRENZY AMONG THE LEFT AS

90
00:03:13,409 --> 00:03:15,777
THEY ALWAYS DO ON THE RIGHT.

91
00:03:15,778 --> 00:03:16,545
IT'S HER TURN NOW.

92
00:03:16,546 --> 00:03:18,346
FRANKLY I'M AT THE POINT WHERE,

93
00:03:18,347 --> 00:03:20,348
IF SHE CONTINUES TO DOUBLE DOWN

94
00:03:20,349 --> 00:03:22,751
COME THE HOUSE WILL TAKE UP A

95
00:03:22,752 --> 00:03:23,952
MOTION TO CENSOR HER.

96
00:03:23,953 --> 00:03:25,153
BECAUSE THIS DOES LEAD TO

97
00:03:25,154 --> 00:03:26,755
VIOLENCE AND IF YOU REMEMBER THE

98
00:03:26,756 --> 00:03:28,790
FAMILY RESEARCH CENTER, THAT WAS

99
00:03:28,791 --> 00:03:30,492
ALSO THE VICTIM OF A GUNSHOT

100
00:03:30,493 --> 00:03:32,160
ATTACK ON AN ACTIVIST WHO DIDN'T

101
00:03:32,161 --> 00:03:33,762
LIKE WITH THE FAMILY RESEARCH

102
00:03:33,763 --> 00:03:34,596
CENTER STOOD FOR.

103
00:03:34,597 --> 00:03:36,398
SEAN MADE THE POINT ABOUT

104
00:03:39,202 --> 00:03:42,204
AND DON'T FORGET ABOUT CAMPAIGN

105
00:03:44,841 --> 00:03:46,208
THIS LEADS TO THINGS I GO TOO

106
00:03:46,209 --> 00:03:48,643
FAR AND YOU NEED TO STAND UP NOW

107
00:03:48,644 --> 00:03:49,945
FOR CIVIL DISCOURSE AND IT'S UP

108
00:03:49,946 --> 00:03:53,715
TO THE DEMOCRATS TO LEAVE THAT

109
00:03:56,519 --> 00:03:57,752
STARS ALSO FEEL LIKE THEY CAN

110
00:03:57,753 --> 00:04:01,323
WEIGH IN ON ALL THIS STUFF.

111
00:04:01,324 --> 00:04:01,823
AND MUSICIANS.

112
00:04:01,824 --> 00:04:05,694
LET'S MAKE A DEAL WITH THE TRUMP

113
00:04:05,695 --> 00:04:07,696
ADMINISTRATION AND REUNITE ALL

114
00:04:07,697 --> 00:04:08,163
THOSE FAMILIES.

115
00:04:08,164 --> 00:04:09,731
AND THEN YOU CAN GO OUT TO EAT

116
00:04:09,732 --> 00:04:10,432
WHEREVER YOU WANT.

117
00:04:10,433 --> 00:04:13,335
THE OTHER PART OF THIS, THIS

118
00:04:13,336 --> 00:04:16,838
POLICY -- THIS IS WHAT BOTHERS

119
00:04:16,839 --> 00:04:18,140
ME THE MOST.

120
00:04:18,141 --> 00:04:19,307
WE NEED TO HAVE A DISCUSSION

121
00:04:19,308 --> 00:04:21,209
ABOUT THE POLICY AND WHY IT'S

122
00:04:21,209 --> 00:04:22,143
GOING ON.

123
00:04:22,145 --> 00:04:23,945
GRANTED, THERE HAS BEEN A RAMP

124
00:04:23,946 --> 00:04:26,848
UP HERE BECAUSE THERE IS A ZERO

125
00:04:26,849 --> 00:04:27,749
TOLERANCE OF -- WHICH

126
00:04:27,750 --> 00:04:28,617
ESSENTIALLY MEANT THAT THE LAWS

127
00:04:28,618 --> 00:04:31,720
THAT WERE ON THE BOOKS AND THE

128
00:04:31,721 --> 00:04:32,420
DECISION BY THE NINTH CIRCUIT

129
00:04:32,421 --> 00:04:34,322
COURT MEANT THAT ALL OF THAT WAS

130
00:04:34,323 --> 00:04:35,924
GOING TO BE ENACTED.

131
00:04:35,925 --> 00:04:36,925
THAT SAYS IF YOU ARE APPREHENDED

132
00:04:36,926 --> 00:04:40,562
IT, YOU WILL BE SEPARATED

133
00:04:40,563 --> 00:04:41,429
BECAUSE THAT COURT DECIDED THAT

134
00:04:41,430 --> 00:04:47,469
IT WAS NOT PROPER TO INCARCERATE

135
00:04:47,470 --> 00:04:52,541
THE FAMILIES TOGETHER.

136
00:04:52,542 --> 00:04:57,245
AND, THE PICTURES WERE EXACTLY

137
00:04:57,246 --> 00:04:57,812
LIKE THEY WERE THEN.

138
00:04:57,813 --> 00:05:00,749
SO THIS HAS BEEN LOST IN THE

139
00:05:04,153 --> 00:05:04,953
HYSTERICAL BACK THEN.

140
00:05:04,954 --> 00:05:07,189
>> TWO QUICK COMMENTS ON THAT.

141
00:05:07,190 --> 00:05:08,823
NUMBER ONE, WHEN I FOUND

142
00:05:08,824 --> 00:05:10,559
TROUBLING ABOUT THE SARAH

143
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:11,526
SANDERS INCIDENT WAS IN

144
00:05:11,527 --> 00:05:12,327
JOHN ROBERTS' REPORT EARLIER IN

145
00:05:12,328 --> 00:05:13,929
THE PROGRAM.

146
00:05:13,930 --> 00:05:15,764
HE TALKED ABOUT THE FACT THAT

147
00:05:15,765 --> 00:05:16,965
AFTER SARAH POLITELY DECIDED TO

148
00:05:16,966 --> 00:05:19,134
GET UP, NOT MAKE A SCENE AND

149
00:05:19,135 --> 00:05:22,537
LEAVE THE RESTAURANT, MANY

150
00:05:22,538 --> 00:05:23,271
PEOPLE ACCORDING TO JOHN'S

151
00:05:23,272 --> 00:05:24,773
REPORT GOT UP AND FOLLOWED HER

152
00:05:24,774 --> 00:05:26,541
DOWN THE STREET, TRYING TO

153
00:05:26,542 --> 00:05:27,409
HARASS HER FURTHER.

154
00:05:27,410 --> 00:05:28,944
THIS HAS GONE WELL BEYOND

155
00:05:28,945 --> 00:05:30,545
STATING AN OPINION OR FREE

156
00:05:30,546 --> 00:05:32,547
SPEECH, IT'S NOW INTIMIDATION

157
00:05:32,548 --> 00:05:33,615
AND THREATENING VIOLENCE WHICH I

158
00:05:33,616 --> 00:05:35,917
THINK IS CROSSING A BIG LINE.

159
00:05:35,918 --> 00:05:38,353
BUT TO YOUR POINT, WE HAVE A WAY

160
00:05:38,354 --> 00:05:47,128
IN A DEMOCRACY TO NOT TAKE

161
00:05:47,129 --> 00:05:48,563
PEOPLE.

162
00:05:48,564 --> 00:05:49,731
THE REALITY IS, THE PRESIDENT OF

163
00:05:49,732 --> 00:05:51,132
THE UNITED STATES IS ENFORCING

164
00:05:51,133 --> 00:05:52,834
THE LAWS ON THE BOOKS.

165
00:05:52,835 --> 00:05:54,369
IF PEOPLE DON'T LIKE THE LAWS ON

166
00:05:54,370 --> 00:05:55,904
THE BOOKS, EITHER OR BOTH OF

167
00:05:55,905 --> 00:05:57,339
PEOPLE IN OR OUT THAT YOU LIKE

168
00:05:57,340 --> 00:05:58,440
OR ENCOURAGE THOSE IN OFFICE TO

169
00:05:58,441 --> 00:06:00,575
CHANGE THE LAW.

170
00:06:00,576 --> 00:06:02,744
WE DON'T RESORT TO VIOLENCE AND

171
00:06:02,745 --> 00:06:03,345
WE CERTAINLY DON'T

172
00:06:03,346 --> 00:06:03,778
ENCOURAGEMENT.

173
00:06:03,779 --> 00:06:05,614
AND LET ME SAY THIS, IT'S WRONG

174
00:06:05,615 --> 00:06:07,549
IF YOU ARE REPUBLICAN, WRONG IF

175
00:06:07,550 --> 00:06:08,550
YOU'RE A DEMOCRAT AND WRONG IF

176
00:06:08,551 --> 00:06:09,584
YOU ARE CONSERVATIVE.

177
00:06:09,585 --> 00:06:12,153
WE COULD SPEND THE REST OF THE

178
00:06:12,154 --> 00:06:13,355
NIGHT DEBATING WHO STARTED IT.

179
00:06:13,356 --> 00:06:14,522
I'D RATHER ENGAGE IN DISCUSSION

180
00:06:14,523 --> 00:06:15,957
OF HOW TO STOP IT AND HOW TO

181
00:06:15,958 --> 00:06:17,392
MOVE FORWARD BECAUSE THIS IS NOT

182
00:06:17,393 --> 00:06:18,760
THE RIGHT DIRECTION FOR OUR

183
00:06:18,761 --> 00:06:19,961
COUNTRY.

184
00:06:19,962 --> 00:06:20,662
WE NEED TO UNDERSTAND THAT WE

185
00:06:20,663 --> 00:06:24,532
CAN RESPECTFULLY DISAGREE ON

186
00:06:24,533 --> 00:06:25,734
POLITICS AND WE CAN BE

187
00:06:25,735 --> 00:06:28,136
RESPECTFUL OF OUR FELLOW MAN AND

188
00:06:28,137 --> 00:06:28,436
WOMAN.

189
00:06:28,437 --> 00:06:29,571
>> LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT THE

190
00:06:29,572 --> 00:06:31,373
PRESIDENT AND WHAT HE TWEETED

191
00:06:31,374 --> 00:06:32,140
EARLIER TODAY.

192
00:06:32,141 --> 00:06:34,943
THIS GOT QUITE A BIT OF

193
00:06:34,944 --> 00:06:35,343
ATTENTION.

194
00:06:35,344 --> 00:06:37,412
"WE CANNOT ALLOW ALL THESE

195
00:06:37,413 --> 00:06:38,947
PEOPLE TO INVADE OUR COUNTRY.

196
00:06:38,948 --> 00:06:39,948
WHEN SOMEONE COMES IN WE MUST

197
00:06:39,949 --> 00:06:41,983
IMMEDIATELY COME UP WITH NO

198
00:06:41,984 --> 00:06:43,618
JUDGES OR COURT CASES, BRING

199
00:06:43,619 --> 00:06:45,220
THEM BACK FROM WHERE THEY CAME.

200
00:06:45,221 --> 00:06:48,623
OUR SYSTEM IS MARGUERITE TO

201
00:06:48,624 --> 00:06:49,691
IMMIGRATION POLICIES AND OF LAW

202
00:06:49,692 --> 00:06:50,125
AND ORDER.

203
00:06:50,126 --> 00:06:54,195
WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT THAT, HE

204
00:06:54,196 --> 00:06:55,430
GOT A LOT OF HEAT.

205
00:06:55,431 --> 00:06:56,931
>> BORDER PATROL AGENT AND YOU

206
00:06:56,932 --> 00:06:58,199
SEE SOMEONE COMING ACROSS THE

207
00:06:58,200 --> 00:06:59,634
RIVER, CAN'T YOU JUST SEND THEM

208
00:06:59,635 --> 00:07:01,569
TO THE OTHER SIDE OF THE RIVER?

209
00:07:01,570 --> 00:07:04,606
WHY DO YOU HAVE TO LET THEM LAND

210
00:07:04,607 --> 00:07:06,174
AND GO THROUGH A WHOLE PORT

211
00:07:06,175 --> 00:07:06,508
PROCESS?

212
00:07:06,509 --> 00:07:08,576
ON THE OTHER HAND, WE ARE A

213
00:07:08,577 --> 00:07:09,577
NATION OF LAWS WHICH IS WHAT

214
00:07:09,578 --> 00:07:10,578
MAKES US GREAT.

215
00:07:10,579 --> 00:07:12,981
WHEN PEOPLE DO, AND THEY ARE AND

216
00:07:12,982 --> 00:07:14,983
OUR COUNTRY, AND THEY'VE CROSS

217
00:07:14,984 --> 00:07:16,584
THE BORDER UNDER OUR

218
00:07:16,585 --> 00:07:18,219
CONSTITUTION, ALL PERSONS, NOT

219
00:07:18,220 --> 00:07:19,621
CITIZENS BUT PERSONS ARE

220
00:07:23,693 --> 00:07:26,461
THAT'S WHAT MAKES US GREAT.

221
00:07:26,462 --> 00:07:29,331
IT IS SAID THAT LAWS ARE THE

222
00:07:29,332 --> 00:07:30,732
RESTRAINTS THAT MAKE US FREE.

223
00:07:30,733 --> 00:07:31,533
AND THAT'S TRUE.

224
00:07:31,534 --> 00:07:33,201
BUT THEY ARE RESTRAINTS AND

225
00:07:33,202 --> 00:07:34,769
THOSE RESTRAINTS COME WITH

226
00:07:34,770 --> 00:07:35,770
BURDENS.

227
00:07:35,771 --> 00:07:37,739
ONE OF THOSE BURDENS IS TO HAVE

228
00:07:37,740 --> 00:07:39,140
A JUDICIAL PROCESS IN PLACE.

229
00:07:39,141 --> 00:07:41,676
I HOPE IT'S FAST, QUICK AND FAIR

230
00:07:41,677 --> 00:07:44,546
AND PEOPLE WHO DON'T BELONG HERE

231
00:07:44,547 --> 00:07:46,348
SHOULDN'T BE HERE.

232
00:07:46,349 --> 00:07:50,952
>> I WAS TALKING 3-5 YEARS

233
00:07:50,953 --> 00:07:51,286
WAITING.

234
00:07:51,287 --> 00:07:54,122
SO ONCE YOU GET ACROSS THE

235
00:07:54,123 --> 00:07:59,761
BORDER YOU ARE 343 TO FIVE YEARS

236
00:07:59,762 --> 00:08:00,995
UNTIL THE JUDGE KICKS IN.

237
00:08:00,996 --> 00:08:02,430
>> YOU SHOULD BE THROWN OUT IF

238
00:08:02,431 --> 00:08:04,366
YOU DON'T BELONG HERE, BUT I

239
00:08:04,367 --> 00:08:06,167
WANT IMMIGRANTS TO COME TO THIS

240
00:08:06,168 --> 00:08:07,569
COUNTRY AND I WANT PEOPLE TO

241
00:08:07,570 --> 00:08:08,737
THINK AMERICA IS THE BEST

242
00:08:08,738 --> 00:08:09,938
COUNTRY, THE FIRST COUNTRY THEY

243
00:08:09,939 --> 00:08:13,341
WANT TO COME TO BUT, YOU HAVE TO

244
00:08:13,342 --> 00:08:14,175
COME HERE ILLEGALLY.

245
00:08:14,176 --> 00:08:16,778
YOUR FAMILY IS NEVER GOING TO BE

246
00:08:16,779 --> 00:08:17,879
SEPARATED.

247
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:19,547
YOUR FAMILY WILL PROBABLY THRIVE

248
00:08:19,548 --> 00:08:20,815
BEFORE THEM LIKE BECAUSE OF WHAT

249
00:08:20,816 --> 00:08:21,750
AMERICA OFFERS.

250
00:08:21,751 --> 00:08:22,851
BUT IF YOU DO SOMETHING ILLEGAL

251
00:08:22,852 --> 00:08:24,552
TO GET HERE IT'S A OFF BAD

252
00:08:24,553 --> 00:08:25,420
CONSEQUENCES FOR YOU AND

253
00:08:25,421 --> 00:08:26,588
EVERYBODY IN THE GOVERNMENT WHO

254
00:08:26,589 --> 00:08:29,357
HAS TO DEAL WITH WHAT YOU DID.

255
00:08:29,358 --> 00:08:30,458
>> Martha: SEAN, WE ARE

256
00:08:30,459 --> 00:08:31,526
WATCHING LEFT COLUMBIA AND WE

257
00:08:31,527 --> 00:08:33,762
KNOW THAT AIR FORCE ONE HAD TO

258
00:08:33,763 --> 00:08:35,163
CIRCLE BECAUSE OF THUNDERSTORMS

259
00:08:35,164 --> 00:08:36,364
IN THE AREA.

260
00:08:36,365 --> 00:08:37,565
THE PRESIDENT IS THERE TO

261
00:08:37,566 --> 00:08:39,768
SUPPORT HENRY McMASTER, AND HE

262
00:08:39,769 --> 00:08:41,936
HAS ANOTHER RALLY COMING UP

263
00:08:41,937 --> 00:08:42,404
LATER THIS WEEK.

264
00:08:42,405 --> 00:08:43,438
WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THE

265
00:08:43,438 --> 00:08:44,439
DECISION THAT THE PRESIDENT HAS

266
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:45,974
MADE IT TO GET BACK OUT ON THE

267
00:08:45,975 --> 00:08:48,209
ROAD AND BACK OUT TO DOING THESE

268
00:08:48,210 --> 00:08:48,543
RALLIES.

269
00:08:48,544 --> 00:08:50,278
WHAT DOES THAT TELL YOU?

270
00:08:50,279 --> 00:08:52,614
>> IT TELLS ME THAT HE

271
00:08:52,615 --> 00:08:54,149
UNDERSTANDS HOW IMPORTANT IT IS

272
00:08:54,150 --> 00:08:55,850
TO MAINTAIN A REPUBLICAN HOUSE

273
00:08:55,851 --> 00:08:56,251
AND SENATE.

274
00:08:59,155 --> 00:09:00,755
WORK WITH HIM.

275
00:09:00,756 --> 00:09:04,592
THEY ARE ALREADY FOCUSED SO I

276
00:09:04,593 --> 00:09:05,326
THINK THE PRESIDENT UNDERSTANDS

277
00:09:09,131 --> 00:09:12,734
UNDERSTAND THE BINARY CHOICES

278
00:09:12,735 --> 00:09:16,805
THEY MAKE.

279
00:09:16,806 --> 00:09:17,372
IT'S NANCY PELOSI AND

280
00:09:17,373 --> 00:09:18,440
CHUCK SCHUMER WHO ARE GOING TO

281
00:09:18,441 --> 00:09:20,141
RAISE OUR TAXES, SPEND MORE

282
00:09:20,142 --> 00:09:22,143
MONEY AND I THINK CONTINUE TO

283
00:09:22,144 --> 00:09:23,178
MAKE POOR DECISIONS ON POLICY.

284
00:09:23,179 --> 00:09:24,546
>> Martha: GREAT TO HAVE YOU

285
00:09:24,547 --> 00:00:00,000
GUYS WITH US, TO FORMER
