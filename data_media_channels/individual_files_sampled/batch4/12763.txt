Hogg's arguments I have a question for you guys who's ready to save America who's ready to make America the country that we say is on paper and make it the actual country that it wants to be I think it's the the most important thing to realize however it's the problems that we face as a country whether it be water in Flint Michigan or the amount of mass incarceration of people in Cuyler of color that can't vote in Florida the amount of eligible African Americans that would otherwise be eligible to vote that can't because of a previous conviction is 21% in Kentucky it's 26% in Mississippi and Alabama it's 15 to 16 percent these are people of color that have been historically discriminated against and still are to this day and have their voting rights taken away it's exactly turn that shame into your vote turn that shame into your vote except we're in Canada so here we have now David hogging the Democrats promoting election fraud Canadians go vote either really they really are trying to steal elections now probably what it is is he just forgot he was in Canada he doesn't know that much about politics the reason I point out this little segment though is I want to point out the racism of this argument we hear this a lot from Democrats they say you know we lock up all of our criminals we lock up so many criminals and by the way that's why the crime rate has decreased so markedly over the last few decades but we lock up our criminals and that is racist somehow and the premise of that argument is that criminals and black people are the same thing but they're not the same thing that's a bit that's a very offensive thing to say the Democrats keep saying that locking up criminals is not racist that's just a matter of justice black people are not criminals those are not synonymous and when they make that argument it really you just think you know that they are always arguing about white privilege you're think that is the most blind tone-deaf privileged argument I've ever heard but then he gets to correct the record on Canadians voting I can AI think Canadians can donate to political campaigns in the United States they can't well well vote here makes because this poor kid is is saying all of this nonsense he's spouting all of his ignorance and then he's turning to Michael Moore and he says do they can they can they donate to political no they can when you have to turn to Michael Moore to get your knowledge about the American political system you are in deep trouble that is not a good place to be in cities as well vote here and this is something that the left does all the time III noticed this whenever you argue about one particular issue with the left you'll help say their crazy point then you'll say your point and you'll shut down their idea and then they'll just change the topic and they'll say well what about this you see with abortion you say abortion is bad and we shouldn't have any abortion and it shouldn't be legal and they say yeah but how much welfare spending should we spend on kids you say well that's a separate topic I'm not talking about that you say you're talking about some war or something in the Iraq war and they say yeah well how much money should we spend on public schools so I'm not talking about public schools I'm trying I'm talking about the Iraq they keep moving it because they have to move the goal posts they don't have any argument on the topic that you're actually at talking about and then there is just the blithe ignorance and this was the PS teller resistance I took the lid off of my tumblr so that I could fill it up from Toronto take it away mr. Hogg I this question if to the IRS if you're watching on Facebook why aren't you auditing the President of the United States who likely got thirty million dollars from Russia via the NRA there's an active Department of Justice investigation into this that nobody's talking about also we're still at war in Afghanistan what the hell like I'm I'm 18 years old that war was started 17 years ago think about that also Cheez doodles are orange also it's kind of chilly outside now because it's the fall also you're just saying random facts also pepperoni pizza is delicious it's just sputtering and sputtering right yes of course we can discuss the war in Afghanistan i I don't know that think about that is really the best way to do it but this point he mentions which is that the NRA spent 30 million dollars that it got from Russia on the Trump campaign that is simply not true that is just flat-out false he says that nobody's talking about that we know how much money the NRA got from the Russians whoo boris and Natasha whoo the NRA received about $2,500 from the Russians that is slightly less slightly more rather than an order of magnitude off from what David August said two orders of magnitude off from what David Hogg said and the NRA has owned up to this they've said yeah we've gotten some money from a lot of different places and we can trace some Russian nationals they gave us about $2,500 now you might ask why was that number so low mostly because it's membership fees you know this if you join the NRA you pay 30 bucks a year 100 bucks a year and then you get your little membership card into the NRA so that's what he's talking about there's a big difference between that and 30 million dollars more importantly nonprofits can take money from whomever they like it's not like a political campaign they can take money from any sources they like how do we know this because the Clinton Foundation did this for years and years in a way that the left had told us that's perfectly fine do you remember Saudi Arabia gave the Clinton Foundation 25 million dollars which is close to the number that David Hogg's talking about maybe that's where he got the idea from so they give the Clinton Foundation 25 million dollars and then Hillary Clinton is Secretary of State approves a twenty nine billion dollar arms sale to Saudi Arabia that there might be some problems with that we might want to look into that but it's perfectly fine for the NRA to get membership dues from people around the world especially when those membership dues don't add up to very much this just shows the left is really not to be taken seriously here we've really entered into silly season they're getting basic facts wrong they don't care that they're getting basic facts wrong and I don't even want to just beat up on David hog because the elected Democrats and Democratic operatives are no better they're no more serious it's the the Democrat Party has decayed into a dying vaudeville show nowhere has that become clearer then at the Brett Kavanaugh confirmation hearings there was a big press release that came out over the weekend Democratic coalition so this is a super PAC that helps Democrats and left-wing candidates the Democratic coalition sends out this press release it says quote Democratic coalition files criminal complaint against judge Brett Kavanaugh for perjury in congressional testimony okay what's what are they talking about what they're talking about is that a decade or so ago it's during some congressional testimony they think that Break haveno lied even though actual legal experts don't think he lied at all and there's no evidence that he lied so that's what they're saying they're talking about perjury and a congressional testimony a decade ago which didn't happen then the press release goes on it says a separate judicial ethics complaint will be submitted on Monday to the clerk of the DC Circuit for Chief Judge Merrick garland to review oh how delicious Merrick garland passed over for the Supreme Court Barack Obama sort of nominated him Republicans wouldn't let him sit oh wow is this gonna be good the only problem with this tactic is that it's not even true it won't work and it's not even true we'll get to that in a second but first I have to thank wonderful sponsor Express VPN you know if you're watching this show I know that you look at some weird stuff on the Internet okay I know that you need to protect your privacy on the Internet if you I'm obvious I'm talking about daily wire comm you need to get expressvpn I'm serious you should not be on the internet open and exposed you need a VPN to just cover up all these security breaches we've been seeing all of the Facebook and Twitter and all the social media people going in front of Congress saying that they are not taking privacy seriously when you make an online purchase or even simply access your email you could be putting your private information at risk you're being tracked by social media by marketing companies all over the other day I was just talking about a type of shoe in the green room and then I started getting ads for the shoe that is really creepy noses on my phone thank goodness I use expressvpn on my computer it secures and anonymizes your internet browsing it encrypts your data it's just seven bucks a month do it do it today this is the best seven bucks you will spend go do it expressvpn comm slash michael mi CH AE l you will get three months free expressvpn expr ESS VPN comm slash michael mi CH AE l three months free with one-year package expressvpn comm slash michael that is the problem with this demo strategy the only problem with it is that it's not true they say they're filing a criminal complaint against Brett Kavanaugh the way we know this isn't true is that it isn't possible private citizens cannot file criminal complaints with the federal court system that's not how it works you can so what they did do is they wrote a letter to the Department of Justice and they said we really want you to punish Brett Kavanaugh so what actually what the press release should have said is press release breaking Democratic coalition writes a strongly worded letter a strongly worded letter to the other aspects by the way is Merrick garland is an appeals court judge so if they have some ethical complaint about judge Kavanaugh they're not it's not going to go to Merrick garland it's not going to go to a district judge period it's not going to go to an appeals judge it's gonna go to the entity that holds Bret Cavanaugh's law license even voxcom admits that this is nonsense and you know for voxcom to say it I don't defer to Viacom and a lot of issues but even the left here is saying this is all show but these are the big headlines over the weekend this is the big viral news story why are they doing this why are they running on craziness up in Toronto and these fake press releases that are just a pure lie in the headline it's because they have nothing else to run on what are they going to run on they box themselves in we've been hearing about Russia gate for two years this is this investigation the Muller investigation was going on for over two years and what have we gotten out of it we found out that Paul Manafort likes expensive suits and just in the last few days they've sentenced george papadapolis he's the trump staffer who spoke to a maltese professor who had ties to the Russian government who probably is best friends with Vladimir Putin I don't I made that last part up and what did the sentence deliver what have we got for George papadopolis 14 days in prison two weeks in prison 14 days 200 hours community service 13 months super supervised release a nine thousand dollar fine and 14 days in prison this really beggars belief this really beggars belief I think the Democrats put all of their eggs in this basket they were so shocked and upset by the 2016 election they said this can't happen we just have to undo it if they'd spent that time creating a positive agenda they might have something to run on right now but they don't so they're just retreating back and back they say it didn't happen it didn't really happen please no Trump's really a Manchurian Candidate nobody is believing them and so this question or the Democrats being obtuse or the Democrats being ignorant here I think at this point this far in it is very hard to conclude that they're not just being obtuse they're not playing a cynical vaudeville game and I've got some more evidence of this in what is undoubtedly the most ridiculous video on the Internet I this was going all around Twitter if this is from Liz plank at elle.com because in the Cavanaugh hearings abortion has been the big topic even when they're not openly talking about it everything is about roe v wade or you gonna overturn roe women's health that's the euphemism they use women's reproductive health that's the crazy euphemism they use because abortion and reproduction are diametrically opposed to one another so here is what passes for comedy and argumentation on the Left l.com making a video about abortion introducing male masturbation crisis centers sometimes self-love happens and just because you do it alone doesn't mean that you are alone no seriously how did you get in here look Trevor when you're going five against one you're not just rubbing one out in fact you're rubbing out 70 to 300 million sperm the actual seeds of life what men must respect these potential lives and that's where we come in as it is currently law in 35 states in the case of abortion we offer mandate a preliminary consultation up to 48 hours before your masturbation event after all we want you to be fully aware of all of your options and consequences when you choose to tickle your pickle look if you're under the age of 18 and are thinking about masturbation we'll ask your parents before you can follow Emily Ratajkowski Instagram to see where she travels do you get it do you get the point that she's the sort of point she's trying to make you get it what she's saying is that men masturbation is just like getting an abortion now I can't believe that I even have to explain this but I think I do because the left has failed biology 101 they failed health class they were probably all outside you know who knows what they were smoking behind the gymnasium that's probably why the legalization campaign is so big on the left right now a sperm cell is not the same thing as an unborn baby it's not the same thing genetically it's not the same thing biologically if you leave them uninterrupted one of them will just remain a cell the other one will become a full-grown human person who can make stupid videos like that one and I wonder if this is because they don't get the argument or they just refuse to engage with it they never engage with the argument at these Cavanagh hearings Kamala Harris Cory Booker they never engage with real arguments it was all shows and distractions to the other side and let's just drill down into what this is if Brett Kavanaugh is confirmed which he almost certainly will be people are worried these hostile to roe v wade and that he'll overturn roe v wade i'm not so sure about that ab n is not so sure about that Ben thinks that he would not actually have returned roe v wade they might play some further restrictions on abortion but that there's enough precedent that Cavanaugh in his judicial opinion wouldn't overturn it who knows we'll have to see what happens with the left is saying is that if roe v wade gets overturned then we're going to have abortion outlawed across the country that's not true what happens if roe v wade is overturned is that the question is returned to the states and some states will have legal abortion some states will not have legal abortion that's our federal system that's a wonderful thing what they're the left is also saying is that the Constitution has a right to abortion enshrined in it and I have to ask them I've never gotten a good answer to this do they really believe that James Madison and Alexander Hamilton sat down said okay we're gonna have a free speech in there yeah we're gonna have a balance of power separation of powers and oh hey Alexander don't forget the right to an abortion you can't forget the right to an abortion in there that's that's what we fought that revolution for isn't it Alexander of course not nobody thinks that that is the case but the left is not playing politics in good faith here they're not playing but they're interrupting the hearings they're making a total show of the hearing they're pretending that all of you know millions and millions of documents need to be read from when Brett Kavanaugh was in middle school or else we can't decide if he's an able judge the man's been a judge for a long time people on both sides of the aisle say he's a very competent judge they're not playing politics in good faith they know that they lost they're still really sore about lose in that election and rather than regrouping or using legal or serious means of trying to counter the current president they're throwing these hysterics they're just throwing a total temper tantrum and this is why total providence all nature is but art unknown to thee over the weekend to the US Open we got to see as Serena Williams embody the Democrat Party I wish I wish he had actually played her game at the at the Congress but Serena Williams if you didn't watch it the US Open a Naomi Osaka won she was not expected to win Serena Williams was expected to win and Serena Williams lost why did Serena Williams lose because she got outplayed by Naomi Osaka that's how that says sports work every conservative every Republican who was watching this game was watching Serena Williams have this meltdown and just thinking huh this looks a lot like national politics over the last two years huh if someone got outplayed and then rather than being a good sport about it they'd break down and start crying Roger Kimball wrote up this great piece on it where he kept referring to Serena Clinton and Hillary Williams so here is the the way this first started is that Serena Williams got called for cheating not big cheating not the crazy cheating but she got she was getting a sign from her coach and she got called out on it she didn't think she was going to get caught and she loses it here's Serena Williams Carlos Ramos to the chair you don't know that and understand why you may have thought out but that was coaching not I don't cheat you in the coaching violation Megan's a thumbs up and Serena's setting him straight that is not so not a good way to start if she gets called on this she immediately goes up deny deny deny and but by the way her coach later Patrick Mouratoglou admitted that he was giving the signal he did admit later so now she looks like she's got a lot of egg on her face and there were two aspects here one Serena Williams's first instinct is deny it get up in that guy's face say no what dare you call me on that that wasn't what it was I'm letting you know that but then you heard the commentator there the commentator said Oh Serena Williams is just setting him straight so well I don't know if she's setting him straight did she get the sign or not she did get the sign we all saw it there are cameras all over the place did she get the sign or not to Hillary Clinton wipe the server or not did Hillary Clinton get the money from Saudi Arabia or not we all saw it stop telling us not to believe our lying eyes but then it gets even worse from there because it starts out now Serena's getting really agitated really upset and then she finally loses her temper publicly sir smash that one carrot violation record abuse to mrs. rutter's code violation private email server code violation what do you mean private so Serena Williams just takes her her racket just smashes it on the ground which you're not supposed to do for a couple reasons one it's a violation and - it's not how a sportsman plays it's unsportsmanlike u @ you don't have any sportsmanship when you're doing that because it's not just all about Serena Williams she doesn't just get to win the game just cuz just because she is who she is Hillary Clinton doesn't get to become president just cuz Jessica the waltz her turn it's her she's waited long enough it's her turn that's all about Hillary there's no one else is even running are they it's just Hillary and all of the distractions and it's that same thing you know Hillary Clinton's private email server was discovered what did she do she just hurled a bunch of bleach bit on top of it she just wiped the whole thing up whoops sorry did you senator Clinton Secretary Clinton did you wipe your server what did I wipe it with a cloth just very very angry and then finally worst of all she just loses her cool at the umpire I didn't get coaching you need to take you need to make an announcement that I didn't get coaching I don't cheat I didn't get coaching how can you say that you are after cheating in my life I have a daughter in established right everything apology spoiler alert she's not gonna get her apology but as your you owe me an apology my opponents are deplorable and irredeemable you owe me you say you're sore it was the Macedonians it was the clique forms with the Russians there was okay Hillary yeah that's fine really looks awful totally losing her cool screaming she's sort of on the verge of tears and then what you heard in there you heard about 3/4 of the way through it's the beginning of the identity politics here that she said I have a daughter and I haven't cheated so what what does that have to do with anything we say I didn't cheat and then the the umpire can point out no you did I saw it and we all saw it you're your coach admitted it you did you know I didn't and I have a daughter okay I had a tuna sandwich for lunch great okay if we're talking about things that don't matter whatsoever she loses her cool and he stands firm now this is a pretty strict umpire Carlos Ramos apparently he's a little more rigid than other umpires but he's sticking to his guns fair enough and then when she's not getting what she wants when he's not gonna kowtow to her and said well you're crying okay you can have it she loses it and she goes full identity politics Serena was watching her coach give her hands emotion you can't Xavier thief because you stole away from me but I'm not a cheater for all the parents out there what would you do if your child behaved this way because listen now that argument goes she cuz you know you're a thief you're deplorable and irredeemable that's what that's what Sarina Clinton would have said she's like you're a thief and he's okay that's a violation that's verbal abuse you're not allowed to verbally abuse the umpire but I did it cuz you stole a point from me but no I didn't you cheated and I saw it and then I took a point for you well within the rules well but you but you should apologize no I'm not apologizing for anything do timeout you go to time it's true by they don't have timeout that's what they should have done that's what they should have done to Serena and and then we get we get the final straw this is the this is the Hillary Clinton what happened book this is the post-election what happened book of the US Open take it away Serena Clinton this is not fair I'm good I'm gonna lose a game just cuz I lost a game I'm what you're good telling me that just cuz I lost that game I'm gonna lose oh and and I I lost a point cuz I cheated and you're saying that's not fair to lose a point if you're cheap that's not fair I was supposed to win Wisconsin I was supposed to win Pennsylvania that's not fair that's not fair and so then you know that that's not a great argument you know I I lost and therefore I lost that's not fair so then she moves on she said so you're gonna take this away from me because I'm a woman I know we're gonna take it away from you because you lost we're actually not taking anything away from you it wasn't yours to begin with you lost it's actually Naomi Osaka's that's who as it is cuz she won and you lost you're taking it away cuz I'm a woman no they actually the winner is a woman - spoiler alert eight - break it to you you can't it you know if only if she had been playing a mate well if she had been playing a man you know it would have been over a lot longer a lot sooner than that but that's not it's not fair it's not fair it's not fair this is being a really bad sport and and it's too bad too because this girl Naomi Osaka did win you know Donald Trump did win somebody did win the election but it just becomes all about the loser when you're a really bad sport and this is why this is why disrespecting the flag is so bad this is why the all of that not my president stuff is so bad we'll explain why in a sec but I've got to say goodbye to Facebook and YouTube I'm sorry I can't believe we're still on Facebook and YouTube frankly I figured we'd have gotten censored a long time ago we're gonna talk about social media censorship at the very end and how you know they're permitting all of the freaking frogs to turn gay but before we do that I have got to tell you if you're on Daily wire calm it look it's ten bucks a month $100 for an annual membership you get me at the end or Clavin show you get the Ben Shapiro show you have to ask questions in the mail bag mail bags coming up on Thursday don't forget that you'll get to ask questions in the conversation next one up with the big boss himself ben shapiro but none of that matters this is what matters the leftist tears tumblr you get this is a frothy brew i actually don't know if it's even legal if it's non-toxic to mix up the David Hogg Democratic coalition and Serena Williams brew is this is that okay is that as any has that even been done before the only way that you can even try it I recommend is in the leftist tiers tumbler any other vessel will just dissolve in your hand it'll probably put burn marks on your hand don't do that don't let yourself be caught unawares go to daily wire calm get the leftist tears tumblr we'll be right back this is why all of this burn you know not burning the flag but kneeling in front of the flag disrespecting the flag Nike putting Colin Kaepernick on it's on it's ads all of the not my president stuff this is why it's so offensive is it so unsportsmanlike it this isn't how we're supposed to behave in a country when you look people lose elections the the politics swings back and forth and bagging where sometimes you're gonna lose lick your wounds regroup go back and I will say I don't think there's a moral equivalence here between the left and the right I think when the right lost the right regrouped there was a great movement called the Tea Party movement which was not about whining and screaming and making up things and saying it's not fair that I lost it was about going back to constitutional arguments going back I mean it was one of the greatest civics lessons in American history was the tea party they said no we need to get back to this we need to rein in this aspect of government we need to rein in the regulatory stay we needed up up up up up they had an agenda and they systematically kept electing people from the local all the way up to the federal level so they were able to do that in the Tea Party what is the left doing they're just whining and screaming trying to undo the election I really don't think there's moral equivalence and if you don't respect the flag then you're not respecting the if you're if you're disrespecting both the game you know actually having the national anthem in the sports game and the flag generally as a symbol of the country you're not playing along with the team you're going against the core aspect of American identity and that is really ugly nobody wants a country like that you know we've got to live with each other we've got to live with these people so you've got you've got to kind of get along and at the end of the game even if you lose and the other guy wins instead of throwing your racket on the ground you've got to go around and say okay good game I'll get you next time but good game and it's this aspect of partisanship that had me a little disappointed in senator Ben Sasse over the weekend here is senator Seth saying he might leave the GOP home state senator thanks so much for joining us I have to start yesterday you retweeted someone who said that they switched their party registration from Democrats and no party and you replied by saying you quote regularly consider switch switching from the Republican Party to becoming an independent as well why and what's stopping you from doing so yeah so I'm one of about eight people in the US Senate who's never been a politician before and I think I've been saying for three years that I conceive of myself as an independent conservative who caucuses with the Republicans but frankly neither of these parties have a long-term vision for the future of the country you know ten years from now where are we gonna be in the future of work when young people are disrupted out of jobs three times a decade future war and cyber that collapse a community like there's massive stuff happening in America and these parties are really pretty content to do 24-hour news cycles screaming at each other the main thing that the Democrats are for is being anti Republican an anti-trump but the main thing Republicans are for is being anti Democrat and anti CNN and here we go it seems to me I have heard this song before you hear this I also love the idea that Senator sass is complaining about politicians going on the 24-hour news cycle while he is on CNN while he is on the 24-hour news cycle I like senator sass I think he's super smart I think he could be a great help to the conservative movement into the GOP and to the country broadly but he's playing this game right now I call it being a Republican but not that kind of Republican it's really you got to say it really faster to youth you see this a lot with Republicans who want to be liked by CNN in the New York Times you seen a lot of college kids are like this they say oh I'm a Republican but I'm not that kind of Republican don't wait no I'm not a bad guy you know I I hope he cuts this out because first of all the New York Times is never going to like you CNN is never going to like you they're gonna use you while you're valuable to them well you're a good cudgel against other Republicans and then they're gonna totally dismiss you when you pose a threat to Democrats but also you need a team you do need a team I'm not saying we need super uber partisanship I'm just pointing out the reality of politics which is that it is a team sport and look at the left right now is the left getting less partisan do you think the Democrats are getting a less partisan all of a sudden that's not what I see in the wacky vaudeville show that's going on in the congressional hearings right now that's not what I'm seeing all across the country in fundraising I'm seeing them doubling down there there our candidates for the Democrats running on impeachment there's supposed to be a legal basis for impeachment they're throwing that out the window they're saying it's pure partisanship it's pure politics you need a team and that this is not the time to start sniping against your own guys I think people need to regroup because they're they're coming after us in a united front both in the civil society and in the government and nowhere is that more clear than in social media so you see this right now on the social media platforms a uniformly they are attacking people who issued left-wing orthodoxy and I'm choosing my words carefully here I'm not saying that they're just targeting conservatives where they're just targeting liberal Republicans or they're just targeting fiscal conservatives as socially Laura I'm not saying or they're just are getting wacko people who are at on the fringes that isn't true what they're doing is they're coming for every single person who is shoes leftist orthodoxy I'm making it to draw that distinction home I will point out that Apple has finally kicked Alex Jones off of its app so you know Alex Jones he's the conspiracy theorist he's the shirtless vitamin salesman but he was kicked off of Twitter why they initially they said he could stay on Twitter and they said he couldn't stay on Twitter they kicked him off of all of his social media platforms they kicked him off his podcast but the app was allowed to remain they never said that he violated a rule or anything they just kicked it off which means that now now that he's off of all of social media he's off of his app we will not be able to get important political commentary like this I don't like a button chemicals in the water it's they turn the friggin frogs gay yeah me neither me neither Alex but I point that out because look is this the conservative agenda to change the water so that the frickin frogs stop turning gay I don't think that's the conservative agenda but they're going after him too why why is the left going after him why is big tech going after Alex Jones because he's the easiest one to get he's the look who's gonna argue against taking that guy off of the air no no none of the self-respecting conservatives who read a lot of books and wear tweed jackets and things like that but he's just the entry point because they're gonna go after him then they're gonna go after Gavan McGinnis off of a bunch of social media platforms now Gavin he Kevin's been on Fox News Gavin's been a much more mainstream figure he found advice media then so then they're gonna and who are they gonna go after next who are they gonna go after next it's all of this line eventually over the weekend we saw Twitter kick-off not crazy Alex Jones not a comedian like Gavin McGinnis not they kicked off kris paronto who is a CIA security contractor at the Benghazi compound he was there fighting during the attack on our compound and our consulate in Benghazi why did they kick him off because he criticized and corrected the record when Barack Obama lied about Benghazi and they kicked him off of Twitter for that this is this is what he said he said quote well Barack Obama previously had said that Republicans and conservatives have delved into conspiracy theories about Benghazi what's the conspiracy theory so he responded kris paronto said benghazi is a conspiracy barack obama how about we do this let's put your cowardly behind on the top of a roof with six of your buddies and shoot RPGs and ak-47s at you while terrorists lob 81 millimeter mortars killing two of your buddies all well waiting for US support that you never sent hashtag scum so is it first of all how did they kick him off they probably were saying oh he threatened Barack Obama that's not a threat he is he is relating his experience at the Benghazi compound when help didn't come because the Obama administration did not respond appropriately to the Benghazi attack and then worse yet afterward they covered it up if anybody's going to talk about a conspiracy the conspiracy was from the Obama administration when they lied about it they said it wasn't a terrorist attack they blamed it on some ridiculous YouTube video and he corrects the record and he gets suspended for them he gets suspended this is what's happening this is a preview because the left broadly blames social media platforms for the 2016 election that before social media before all of the new media the left controlled the mainstream media narrative the the American voters couldn't get conservative perspectives if they weren't distorted and perverted by the left-wing lens of the mainstream media with the new media that came out with the internet with social media conservatives could get their point of view across unvarnished they could control their own message in their own political destiny and they have never forgiven them for that they're raking them over the coals social media is responding to it and it's only gonna get worse this is all about the midterms they're gonna and if it works in the midterms they're gonna amp it up for 2020 this is not the time for that I'm a Republican but not that kind of Republican attitude for sucking up to the New York Times or CNN we really should stop it if the Democrats win the midterms we get impeachment if the Democrats win the Senate we might get a conviction there's still a lot of things that we need to accomplish and it's time that we get serious about accomplishing it before the midterms okay now we've got to move on to things I hate and things I like why are we doing man well it's because for today and tomorrow I'm sitting in for Ben's radio show you know Ben has a radio show that goes at all across the country so I'm sitting in for that I want to really channel Ben you know I did sriracha Sean a happy Rosh Hashanah to all of my Jewish friends and so I really want to channel him and I don't have the yarmulke although Prager you did give me one a few years ago which I refer to as my prettier you mocha but I don't have that I'm not gonna really be able to do that I don't I don't know enough about the history of Rosh Hashanah it's the way I'm gonna channel is I'm gonna do things I hate and things I like I'll do it real quick things I hate waking up early to do Ben's radio show I really you know you know me I need to get at least 17 to 19 hours of sleep per night for Ben's radio show you got to wake up pretty early but that's okay because things I like is doing a Ben's radio show I don't even do we even tell Ben that I'm doing this I basically just kicked down the door and
