the nuclear option of being stripped of EU voting rights is hanging over Poland that's after Brussels activated article 7 for the first time in its history it is with a heavy heart that we have decided to initiate article 7 1 but the facts leave us no choice I stood before you in July when I clearly said that we'd almost reached a situation where we would need to invoke article 7 1 the situation since then it's not improved but deteriorated so we have no other option than to do this today I accept this decision calmly it's about politics not the rule of law the law was triggered over Warsaw's refusal to scrap or authoritarian judicial reforms giving ruling conservatives more control over its courts poland's president just insisted that they won't abandon those plants but the reforms were also under fire at home with thousands of people flooding the streets of the capital in protest last week na zdorovje VMs which part and president scheme EU experts told us that Brussels pressure on Warsaw will only make an already tense situation worse for the entire Union the EU s goal is to impose its power and to show who is the boss in the room the political climate has significantly changed and it is very different comparing to the moment when these states were accepted so this whole situation will only deepen the political crisis it's clearly a political maneuver against directed against government's on the right in the group of VC grad it's a threat to Poland to the Czech Republic to Slovakia to Hungary to Austria which has elected a prime minister on on the right who has made an alliance with the hard right so clearly the European Commission is is getting weaker and and they they do the wrong thing they take the wrong decision this will lead to a split within Europe that will go much deeper
