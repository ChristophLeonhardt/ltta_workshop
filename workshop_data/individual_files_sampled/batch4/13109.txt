Donald and stormy are fighting again the relationship between the President of the United States in the pornstar got stormy after Stormies defamation lawsuit against Trump was tossed by a judge in the aftermath Trump tweeted that stormy was a horse-faced stormy in turn suggested the president was sexually inadequate and called him tiny an arranged Trump then knocked back a couple of beers tore off his shirt and staggered into the street where he stood under Stormies balconies screaming her name at the top of his lungs finally stormy ran outside and her filmy nightgown to try to shut Trump up but when the two got close to each other their anger turned to fiery passion and stormy threw herself into trump's arms and Trump carried her up the stairs for a night of raucous lovemaking which left both the president and the stripper feeling simultaneously deeply satisfied and vaguely ashamed of their animalistic behavior Trump then retreated to the White House to deal with complex negotiations over the latest troubles in the Middle East but that night after some heavy drinking with friends stormy phone Trump and angrily told him she was returning the first edition of Baudelaires Flor de maio he had sent her as a peace offering Trump rushed to the bar to talk some sense into the porn star and the to wound up in his penthouse apartment where he led her to his secret Red Room stocked with sadomasochistic sex toys after tying her up in blindfolding her the commander-in-chief administered a sensual thrashing which aroused stormy so much she threw herself into Trump's arms for a night of raucous lovemaking which left both of them feeling simultaneously deeply satisfied and vaguely ashamed of their animalistic behavior somewhere near dawn a disheveled Trump stumbled back into the Oval Office where he announced he would be interviewing candidates for a new personal secretary who would carry his official documents in her teeth while crawling on her hands and knees apparently one s Daniels has applied for the position so I think we can all see where this scenario is headed Andrew Klavan and this is the Andrew Clavin show alright where's the mailbag day its mailbag day this

per in parentheses Clavin Robin Hood calm and I know what you're saying in parentheses but how do you spell the meals that you are craving there is an e integer but there are no easy there are no it's a speaking of Clavin we the universe has now reached peak Clavin when a the president the United States is trading insults on Twitter with a the porn star that he clearly slept with at some point the world has turned into one of my satires I wrote that Sat that opening today and I thought you know it's almost not a joke it's almost like right there you know and I'm suffering myself from a little cognitive dissonance at this point we're gonna give you a little complexity here so that's that should chase away but half the audience know black play I don't want complexity I just want black and right and right and wrong but there's there's no point coming here if you're not gonna hear what I actually have to stay here is the living truth ever since the Cavanaugh hearings I have been in a state of political bliss I really have I have been so happy with what has happened over the two years of the Trump administration I mean ups and downs crises and all this stuff and normal that's normal American life normal life in any country probably but the fact that there were still enough people to stand up that the kind of panic and left this bullying and lying and the massive massive influence of this dishonest corrupt press the fact that there was still guys who I had thought were had we had just dissolved into that sort of pudding of political realism you know guys like Lindsey Graham just said you know just kind of sitting there or whatever suddenly had this spine and stood up and that and it had to do with trumpet it really did have to do with Trump and it just has made me blissful and you know I know that the midterms are coming up and we don't know what the result of that is gonna be because I think it's gonna be a totally a turnout election and I don't think the polls can really tell us as much about turnout as they can about preferences so we don't know what's gonna happen so maybe in a couple of weeks I'll be miserable but right this minute I have been really blissful and it does make me laugh when Trump is calling this hooker I mean issues affair to call her a hooker she took money after sex I don't know let's call her points are calling her horseface and listen I understand when Samantha be called the Wonka Tromp the c-word the left was like well is that really bad is it you know is it really it's like yes it is but they can get away with it it's always fine for them and they called Trump everything in the world they call him a fascist they call him Hitler they sit and have discussions about how he's really Putin in disguise and the fact that and then that when they turn around when the left turns around says wow you really shouldn't call people horseface if you're president the United States you tend not to listen to him but I got to be honest it bugs me it bugs me Trump has done a great job and he has done a great job by being them he has stooped to their level he has done what people always said with people on the right and comment sections have always said to me no you know you're too nice you're too polite you got to get rid of that we got to fight the way they fight and they were right he broke through he's broken through political correctness he has broken their identity politics they're running around like chickens with their heads cut off if you guys show up if the right shows up for these midterms instead of just sitting around with a grim face on pounding their fists and cherry-picking between this Republican and not that Republican if you show up and the GOP wins in the midterms this will have been two of the greatest years for American governance that have existed in in the modern world really since Reagan these will be two fantastic years they're already two fantastic years so he's achieved a beautiful thing and he's achieved it by being as bad as they are and he's broken they're horrible you know identify deep politics but at the same time we have to stop and think for a minute is this really what we want our politics to be like from now on do we want the left do we want to beat the left politically but lose the culture so that I from now on our presidents are going to be these bores shouting or do we just think Trump is a one-off and we want to build something else after he's gone which is what I think we really should start thinking about that and one of the things we have to think about is the fact that the left has enslaved us with their identity politics groupthink which we throw back at them I've always thought this was wrong you know they say well blacks are this and that we say well you're just as racist as we are instead of saying I don't care about blacks I don't care about race I just don't care every time you mentioned the word color my eyes glaze over I think it's stupid I think it's stupid to rank people according to their color I think it's sinful I think it's ugly I think it's stupid mean we're not gonna do it I don't care what you say I don't care what your figures say I don't care anything about what you say I'm not going to listen instead we throw it back in their face now there was this recent poll that got covered a lot and I covered it that full 80% believe that political correctness is a problem in our country young people don't like it nobody likes it the only people who like it a little bit 66% hate it are people with post graduate degrees so it's good for the elites political correctness is good for the elites why because if people can't say things then we're going to keep the status quo you think it's revolutionary to keep people from saying things but it actually maintains the status quo if people are turned against each other the elites walk away with all the prizes so it's good for rich people it's good you know it's good for corporations and no no controversy no speech nothing like that but there's a part of the study that wasn't covered and Charles Lane wrote about at the Washington Post if you ever watch Fox News and you watch the Bret Baier show Charles Lane is a kind of civil voice of liberal descent on Fox News I always kind of enjoy having him there he shows up on the on the panel afterwards and he writes about the fact that in the same study it shows that 51 between 51 and 66 percent of Americans agree that there's a pressure to think a certain way about controversial topics and that they are afraid to speak out 68% report that it is acceptable for me the person reporting it is acceptable for me to express what I think about race or Islam only among people who are like me they're afraid of saying it in public on immigration 73% feel that way on gay lesbian and gender issues the figure is seventy percent seventy percent of Americans are afraid to say a man as a man and when he puts on the skirt he doesn't become a woman or maybe I disapprove of homosexuality which is perfectly reasonable point of view to have you know it's not it's not a reasonable point of view to hate people but it is a reasonable point of view that certain behaviors are wrong in certain behaviors or right you can you can argue it it should be debatable people are self censoring themselves now Charles Lane writes a certain measure of self-censorship is necessary to democracy to the extent that people refrain from gratuitously broadcasting bigotry it promotes trust and rational discourse but but for all that this report confronts us with a disturbing reality we're a long way from the double morality of Eastern Europe where people say one thing but are thinking another thing in their minds but we are apparently living among millions of our fellow citizens who routinely lie or dissemble about their political opinions out of fear and it's not I lived in England it's not just Eastern Europe where they did that they did it in England too people do not say what they mean they're afraid to even think what they think and that is a horrible horrible thing and they do it here's how they do it okay it's a it's basically a trick it's a rhetorical trick here's how it works four steps first they organize people into grievance groups right you're black you have a problem because you're black that's the only one where they have at least a historical as an historical reason for existing but they organize you into race and sex and transgender they've gotten to the point where they're gonna have people with red hair who believe they're women who were actually dressed as men you know they're gonna do anything they can to keep the divisions going so they organize people into grievance groups then the important one is they associate the grievances of those groups with the right so only the left can save them only government action and restraint using force which is what leftism is taking people's money restraining their speech that's what leftism is only use the use of force by the government can relieve that grievance okay so they associate the relief of grievance with the left and they three they demonize right-wing ideas as being somehow against those groups so everything you say turns into an insult against black people everything you say is an insult against women and it's always the group that is being offended right you know it's only in the West it's only in the West where we believe in individuals right but most of the world in this kind of groupthink and and so it's very powerful in the human mind and number four you demonize anyone who steps out of the grievance group to speak his/her own mind we saw that his or her own mind we saw that with Kanye West he escaped from the identity plantation they set the dogs after him the dogs being CNN and NBC and ABC in the New York Times they sent him after bring that guy back so that's how you do it you put people into group think which is very natural to mankind it's only in the West where we believe in individuals and and then you associate their grievances with the left everything the right says is an attack on them and of course any anyone in the grievance group of dares to think independently also is crucified the great person to talk about this with is my friend Jesse Lee Peterson he is he is when I met Jesse Lee Peterson I thought I was an honest man until I met Julia Peterson he's a pastor and author the host of the Jesse Lee Peterson show on Newsmax TV I am going to be with them at a upcoming Town Hall on Tuesday October 23rd at 7:00 p.m. Pacific is that over at bond Jesse can you hear me is that the bar is that the bar headquarters all right and thank you so much for being a part of that I'm honored that he'll be back I want everybody and their mama to come we're gonna have Republicans Democrats independent tristen's atheist everyone gonna come right all right and it's gonna be October 2 2013 p.m. at the headquarters of bond and Allen they can go to Jesse Lee Peterson dot-com to RSVP and get more information okay what are we gonna be talking about we're gonna be talking about the upcoming election Oh Holly you know who didn't think got a win why and why not their feelings about the great white hope you know you know you and I had a big debate during the primaries where you said Trump was gonna be great and I said he wasn't and you turned out to be so right how come how come you don't mock me more how come you don't they're like send me nasty tweets oh I told you so I believe I know your heart you want what's right you you you know you you walk what's right for the country for everybody really you're not like one of those evil people who just disagreed just to be disagreeing it's our respect men and women like you oh well thank you that's that's a lovely thing to say let's talk a little bit about this things but I gotta tell you this yeah the great white hope has been amazing so far he's been amazing he's been losing more than I even imagined that he would be and it's gonna get better you haven't seen anything yet he's gonna do you think how do you think the midterms are gonna go I that the Democrats will lose out again because they've been action awfully you know just hard I know so bad so even even you know the Democrats who are Democrats and decent people but they're Democrats I think that has been a turn-off for them now the 4,000 left right radicals they're going to go for the Democrats no matter what but the decent Democratic voters I think they have been completely turned off about what they've seen with it with the trial I mean with me hearing for judge Kavanagh with the attacks on the Republicans and people who disagree with them the encouragement of violence by the Wicked Witch of the West Maxine Waters I'm glad you didn't actually say that out loud Jesse you just know you're just thinking it their constant gonna lose out and they shouldn't lose out we don't need those type of people to being in charge of making decisions about our country you know you have been one of the really solid voices against identity politics which the left has used so powerfully yeah is it it seems to me there's some hope that it's crumbling in front of our eyes or is that is that too optimistic no it is crumbling and I've noticed for the last 20-something years I've been saying that there's no such thing as racism yep racism does not is this it has never existed it's a made-up lies or illusion and you hear this from a man who was born on a plantation I grew up under the Jim Crow laws I had to pick cotton and audit good stuff and I didn't hear the word racism growing up at all I heard it's a spiritual battle it's a warfare between good and evil inside the right or raw and there are good people in all races and there are bad people in all races and we should judge people based on character but there are children of the lie you see yeah I see that yeah what is the fallout from the vault steak TV okay yeah yeah be aware of the children of the lie they are made out of issue to appear to be physical and so they've come up with terms like racism sexism homophobia ISM Islam phobia ISM get began Islam right and so you can't saw a problem that doesn't exist but if you see it for what it is you see it as right or wrong you can resolve it and that's all the way we're gonna saw these problems from looking at exactly what they are and not what the children are allowed calling them when when you say there's no such thing as racism do you believe that there's such a thing as a racist no there's a hater a hater okay yeah and your father state you have anger right yeah and all men and women who have anger have been they have fallen away from God from within and from above and so they're in an illusion and Saints it is their father and so they're playing God by judging and hating their fellow man it's enough to see injustice and deal with it but don't resent it because when you resent it it blinds you and you're now subject to it yeah and so that's why people think it's about race because they're angry and can't really see what's going on so what I tell them to do is to go and forgive whomever they are angry at and most of the time it starts in the home with the parents go and forgive your parents and when you forgive them God will forgive you and he would take that spirit of darkness away from you and allow you to see there you can see it has nothing to do with male or female it has nothing to do with color is either right or good and evil in spirit oh yeah that's that is really I think if people for act we're actually able to think like that we'd be a lot further along the line to the kind of freedom we want to see no question about it but that's right now now I've already humbly you know it admitted that you were right about Trump and I was wrong the guy's doing a great job does does it bother you as as a pastor does it bother you this you know when he's saying tweeting insults at this woman this porn star stormy Daniels who I think it's pretty clear he actually had an affair with does it bother you to have a president who behaves in that in that way is that a negative of the country not one iota don't beat around the bush here you know it is one of the bit mistakes that Christians are made and that RINO Republicans have made in the past and that they try to cater and appease evil you cannot appease evil at all you can't give it any room in your personal life or public life because it will destroy you this whole mission is to deceive and destroy and so the Republicans have been afraid to stand up to evil and call it what it is but they have allowed themselves to be called every name in the book to a point that they're afraid to stand up for themselves if you call an evil war man evil all of a sudden you hate women if you call black people not all but most wrong you hate blacks but you've got to call it what it is because if you don't it will end up destroying you so when the president when these people tell if you notice Andrew they're always attacking and calling Christians all kind of names and and now they are attacking men every man on earth is now rape is a murderer I mean an abuser or a molester right they call you whatever they want but they cannot handle being called out and so by the president calling them out they all having a hissy fit it's like putting water on a witch they're screaming yeah all right but the Christians have to be careful not to be emotionally caught up in their overreaction to the press otherwise you gonna identify with evil rather than identify with good so I have to be logical and not emotional all right so fair enough but when when you look back on Trump's you know obviously kind of loose sex life and the the way he lived does that does that bother you at all do you think that's a bad example for instance so that you know you work you work with young men you try and get young men on the straight and narrow not not to live that kind of life is he a bad example to them not at all and the reason for that because that's who he was then there's not who he is today okay and we don't have a right if someone apologizes or repent and their life change we have to see that person for who they are now because we all have sinned I mean if you look back on my life I used to be so into having sex with women that I didn't even think I could live with ourselves but I realized now that that was wrong I was in a father state you know I had this anger for my mother and all men who have anger for their mothers hate all women so they become attraction to what they hate and so they try to get something for women that they don't have to give and that is love and men think sex is love but it's not right and so when I when I forgave my mother God forgave me he gave me back my old identity I no longer have her mindset and her emotions now I have the same perfect love for all people and so I'm not into having sex out of wedlock I could wait you know I can I could gain and get to know the person they get to know me without bringing the emotion of sex into it because the moment you have sex out of wedlock you're blinded to the person that you're dating the minute million women are blinded is based on emotion and so so I don't do that now I'm a different person now and so that's who I should be judged by or just serve about Who I am today not what I did in the past and that's how I see the president the president is not doing that today he said in a perfect example right now and that's what I appreciate about him fair enough fair enough I got to ask you one last question that I got to go but what was your reaction when you watched a Kanye in the Oval Office I was happy I was like right our thing because I know that it's influencing a lot of people especially young black men and women who have not heard out with me another black person stand up and that speaker too and say it like an ear now it'll be nice here if he had not cursed because we should give respect to the white house your home saying yeah but the fact that he's put it out there it's influencing a lot of black men and women and even Maxine uarter said the Wicked Witch with the low IQ she said she said that Kanye should be quiet because he should shut up or something because he is influencing other black people they know what black Americans to take a rule look at the Democratic Party and see that the party has used them and that a Republican party platform is the best platform for them God country freedom independent thinking an individual strong military the Democrats don't want to bless to see that because if the blast abandoned the Democratic Party is over for the party's over for them no question about it and that's what Kanye is doing he's influencing I hope so alright so I'm gonna be there at your town hall on Tuesday October 23rd October 23rd Tuesday at 7 p.m. Pacific and is there website people can go to look it up yeah jessamy peterson dot-com Jesse Lee Peterson calm Jesse it's always great talking to you look forward to seeing you at the Town Hall I totally enjoy talking to you you how you you ask that question you make good comments and I love talking to

coming up the mailbag another another driver drop dropped off the road all right from Adam hello Andrew I sincerely hope this reaches you as I have nowhere else to turn a my fiance and I have been engaged for about a year shortly after our engagement we found out she was pregnant we couldn't have been happier started doing everything we could together to prepare to bring our child into the world however she ended having up having a miscarriage at 12 weeks she started going into a downward spiral since then she's become an alcoholic she will not open up to me will not seek counseling with or without me and it feels more and more like we're not even in a relationship to top things off I just found out ironically she admitted this while intoxicated that a few months ago she got really drunk with some people at a bar ended up going to one of the stranger's house to continue hanging out with everyone and ended up cheating on me with one of them she claims to been so drunk that she cannot remember who it was I cannot begin to tell you how devastated and angry I am at her not just the adultery but that she kept acting like nothing happened for months all I could tell was that she was depressed and kept thinking it was due to the loss of our child not that she cheated on me and was keeping it from me I even asked her if she had cheated on me at one point and she lied right to my face now that she's told me she's groveling saying how sorry she isn't how much she loves me I just don't know if I can trust anything she says and I'm tempted to throw her out of the house any advice would be life-altering thank you well that's horrible it's really sad story I'm so sorry you lost the child I'm gonna be like blunt about this if I were in this situation I would get out of it and I'll tell you why you're talking about marriage marriage is for life it should be for life you should be thinking about it for life over the course of 40 or 50 years of your life you're going to laugh together and you're gonna cry together things terrible things are gonna happen and good things are going to happen that's every life every life what has happened here is she has revealed that there is some incredible internal structural weakness in her that a moment of grief which is a true moment of grief and I'm not in any way belittling her grief destroyed her destroy morality destroyed her self-control destroyed everything about her now that unless you are willing to sign on to someone who in that situation in a crisis situation is gonna fall apart on you and maybe cheat on you again I think it's at this stage in your relationship where you're not married this is the time to end that's what I would do and I know that's hard and I know it's a hard saying because you might say well don't you want to stand by her in her moment of grief if I were married to her yes if I were married to her and we had a child absolutely but in the situation that I that you're in this is a warning sign that over the course of the next decades when things like this will happen sad sad things will happen in life she's not gonna be able to handle it you're gonna be alone and you're gonna be toting around this wreck of a human being who can't even stay sober enough to keep your relationship intact so I'm I know it's judgmental but it's also your future you're talking about your future America the rest of your life is a long time and you want to find somebody that you can live with in harmony even in the bad times cuz the bad times will come alright well that was tough wasn't it yeah but the way I the way I see it from Matthew dear supreme leader of the multiverse I you know I like it when people use it is it so hard to ask people to use my time I've read your memoir the great good thing and can report that it didn't in fact change my life for the better so thank you I just finished reading dennis prager book the rationale Bible Exodus and believed that to change my life for the better I'm looking forward to reading that I'm now looking for annotated versions of the rest of the Bible there is an overabundance of recommendations online given that I found both your memoir and dennis prager x' work deeply moving can you recommend any annotated bible or annotate subset thereof that I should read next I have to tell you something I have never found an annotated Bible that I like and the reason is the reason is I'm not looking for someone to tell me this sort of Orthodox interpretation I'm looking for someone to set the the Bible in context so I know what the person who was writing it was trying to say so for instance if I'm reading the prophets I find the prophets very difficult to understand if I don't know the context in the history in which they're making their prophecies so to that end I can't recommend the Bible but I recommend sincerely not just out of nepotism but also out of nepotism my son is publishing his translation and commentary on Isaiah and it's spectacular I mean first of all he's got it so that you passed the it's on line and you pass the mouse over certain words and it comes up and tells you you know what is Assyria why does it matter in this context and then his commentary is very deep and rich he's a fairly intelligent fellow I don't know he's like you know as long as long as he doesn't come home and try to live off us as these must be a brilliant guy if you want to find it go to a twitter at spencer Clavin it's spe NC ER and no idea how you spell Clavin but it's at spencer Clavin on twitter and you can go from there and subscribe and they'll send it to you in an email but it really is good I'm not I'm not kidding there his Isaiah is good and I've just never found if you if you're listening to this listeners if you've got some commentary that you love some annotated Bible that you love let me know and I'll take a look at it I have bought a number of them and I've never quite found one that really did the trick for me from Brenton dear Supreme Leader Cleveland Clavin I've always wanted to get married but recently I've had a change of heart I'm in my early 30s and after a lot of disappointments over the years I finally decided that I like Who I am and don't need marriage to define my life then I met a girl it was just incredible that is the way this happens she's quite possibly the coolest girl I've ever known we have a lot in common I mean the process of developing a friendship with her I'm quite confident that she does not know that I like her I have a huge problem though I work with her I already deal with anxiety I've had multiple anxiety attacks including chest pains and I do not want to screw something up and potentially make my life miserable at work I'd like to ask her out but feel that the stakes are just too high should I just be satisfied with having a good friend and enjoy the single life or is it worth the gamble thanks Brent that's two questions really and and you've got to deal with the anxiety first but I mean you don't deal with the anxiety before you do anything else but you have to deal with the anxiety why are you so anxious what is making you like that have you always been like that is it something that happened in your life you know that you should not be walking around with anxiety attacks unless it is some physical thing you have and then you just have to live with it but what what it seems to me that you're saying it seems to me that you are giving in to these attacks what you're saying is if I approach this girl I put myself in a situation of anxiety which is true who you do you it's as you say a lot is at stake if you think you've met the girl who might be right for you so lots at stake so you're gonna be anxious if you approach her but why can't you handle an anxiety so I would deal with that I would deal with your anxiety get a counselor if you need one get a you know psychotherapist if you need one I deal with that and then yes I would definitely you know walk it getting out of the work place someplace where you're not where you're just having a cup of coffee together taking a walk together out of the workplace what I would say to her is this listen I do not want to make you uncomfortable I know that work is a difficult place for this but I find you a really appealing person and I would like to get to know you better if you're not in with that that's fine I will go back to just will just go back to working together but I want you to know that I feel that way and I'd like to know you better I mean you don't have to don't you don't have to like you know throw yourself down on your knees and propose to her just say you know you find her an appealing human being and would really like to get to know her better and see where that goes she may be waiting for you to do it I would guess my guess is that she is actually but but also you've got to deal with the anxiety because what you're saying is I'm gonna tale my life and bow to King anxiety let the anxiety control my life and you do not want to do that you want your life to be your life not your anxieties life from Therese I followed the Gosnell story closely when it was in the news what little coverage there was I watched the documentary a38 Owen Lancaster even though I knew how it ended the movie Gosnell had me on the edge of my seat at times how is that possible how did you write a suspense story for something that's such a well documented historic episode well I'm a crime writer I've been doing this all my life and the thing about suspense is what makes people suspenseful what makes a scene suspenseful is character so if the character is a stock character you're gonna get cheap suspense you can do that you can put you know he's the good guy he's on the cliff is he gonna fall off the cliff but good suspense writing elevated suspense writing creates characters that you care about and then you care about the outcome for them and you don't actually know even if you know what the historical outcome is you don't know what the outcome for the character is and you're living with if you if it's written well you're living in that character and course with a movie has to be acted well as as well you're living in that character and you're experiencing what they're experiencing and so it's suspenseful even if you know the ending because you're living through the suspense with them and that's how you do it I mean everything for me in writing is about not just the events it's about which character is in the events that's how you know you have a good story when you've got the right character to go with those events from Josie I am I believe it's pronounced recently I found out that my son-in-law is the grandson of an SS officer who was in a concentration camp Wow he said my my son in law says that he was a good Nazi who escaped to South America and had a daughter raised by a Brazilian family I grew up in post-war Belgium and heard all the stories of horror inflicted by the Nazis there were no good Nazis especially in the camps that's absolutely true my immediate emotional response was to detach from my son-in-law I don't believe I will ever be able to be in the same room with him I have a one-year-old granddaughter my question to you wise Andrew how can I have a relationship with him and my daughter I have suggested a divorce is that wrong yes it's definitely wrong first of all this guy didn't do anything this is his grandfather you do not get cursed by the evil that your grandfather did you're absolutely right there were no good Nazis there are no good Nazis in the camps it was a that fat foul vile satanic philosophy and their actions were satanic but this guy wasn't there he didn't do this she can't help who his grandfather was now he was obviously told like you know Elizabeth Warren he was told this family lore that there was some such a thing as a good Nazi what I would say about this is let it go for now let your anger go that let the subject go go in love to your son-in-law and your daughter and your granddaughter who needs you let them have their happy marriage do not get in the way that would be a foul thing to do that'd be the wrong thing to do after you've calmed down after you've recovered yourself and come back to yourself you can have a loving calm conversation about the fact that there were no good Nazis you don't have to get him he doesn't have to curse his grandfather you don't need to get him to that place but you can express that to him but I would not do it even for a year I would just wait until you've got your senses back because it's not right to blame he could be the son of a Nazi it would still not be right you judge him on his philosophy on what he does now if you find that in fact he's an anti-semite or he's hateful in some way that's a different story but that's not what you've told me what you've told me is just that his grant grandfather did something and that he has been told ways of dismissing it he may not know anything about the Holocaust he may not know anything about World War two the important thing for you to do is have a relationship with your daughter your granddaughter and your son-in-law and I think you need to let put this aside in love and and go forward it's just not right to curse somebody for the deeds of his grandfather it doesn't make any moral sense at all from norm guru drew I just got back from watching the Gosnell movie with my Tuesday morning Bible class it was the most disturbing movie I've ever seen I'm really glad I went to see it everyone in my group was speechless after the closing credits I've heard that a lot that the audience is speechless afterwards when we did regain the ability to speak all agreed that it was a marvelously done movie something I've thought about from this case how much of a time difference would there be in the baby being killed in the womb which would have been legal and the baby being killed after birth which got Gosnell convicted for murder is it merely a matter of minutes between legal abortion and illegal no it's not in most states the limit that is viability which is considered to be 20 weeks or something like that it's different in each state but it's it's usually around 20 weeks but when you think about 20 weeks for a minute it it's five months right that's like five months so a five month old fetus is a baby you know and it may not be viable outside the womb it's still a baby so it's still Savage a savage thing to do but it is legal Gosnell was doing them he was the place that people went to get late-term abortions many of them poor many of them black many of them had been had several abortions and we're basically using it as a form of birth control so anyway it's it there is a difference it's not like one minute the baby is in most states it's not the one minute you can do it in one the next minute you can but but it is there it is pretty far advanced to me to me 20 weeks is a pretty savage thing to do the entire thing to me is bar it's just barbarity I mean I think we have to get our minds right about this from Carlos you're conservative commander Clavin the Constitution is pretty great so I was wondering what changes of any would you make I probably add to the third amendment the government cannot force any wartime behavior on a citizenry and I wouldn't do that actually I think there are emergencies in which freedom takes second place that's why the left is always declaring emergencies you know it's like a climate change emergency because I always trying to get rid of freedom but there are real emergencies in which the government has to call you up the one thing I think the Constitution should have is it should forbid the federal government to redistribute money I know that every free nation ultimately develops a social spending system I think it should be done by the states if it's done at all I do not see the moral I see that I see the benefit of it but I think it has also crippled people there was a wonderful editorial about this I hope to talk about this another time but about how yes it has alleviated poverty social spending does Olivia levy a but it also reduces people the dependency at the same time so I think there should be other there are other ways of alleviating poverty beside that and I think it would be great if the Constitution just said you can't do it you can't do it it's not it's not the power isn't in the Constitution so you shouldn't be able to do it anyway it is all stuff that basically FDR bullied them into permitting all right I gotta wind up but I'll do one more dear Lord Clavin my brother and I used to be very close but he's not spoken with me or several other family members since the election he took great offense to a YouTube video that I shared and he labeled me a racist and unaware of my white privilege he tried to shame me rather than have a conversation I never complained about his left-wing causes emails and forwards over the years but the tolerance is not reciprocated he has such strong hatred for Trump and anything he touches and he has stated I'm done should I take him at his word or how might I reach out to him do I have or wait to wait for a Democrat to take the presidency before I can talk to my brother again I have this in my own life Jonathan it's it is really weird to me that I for eight years Obama they just don't understand they do not see themselves that Obama was just as offensive to me as Trump is to them in so many ways I never started I would argue with them about it but I never stopped talking to anybody I never cursed anybody I never say and yet they feel it's just fine to just write you out of their life like that it is an amazing act of sanctimony and self unawareness that word I have know that where there is no word for cluelessness about oneself and the only thing you can do is you know you can write one email one email to your brother and say look this is the way I feel about this I never did this to you I'm sorry you do this to me I'm always here for you I love you but I'm not gonna reach out to you and be insulted contact me when you calm down that's the only thing I think you can do and then you have to live with that you have to live with that I mean you have to live with when you say goodbye to somebody they might not come back you got to live with it like I said I have this in my own life I've had to do this with people I'm here for them if they want to come back and talk but at the same time I just think I cannot break through the sanctimonious idea that somehow by disagreeing with them politically you are committing an atrocity that means they should write you out of here your life is ridiculous tickety-boo news well as I say there's so much tickety-boo news I really have been in a state of bliss since the Kavanaugh you know the thing about the cabin I think is not Cavanaugh but I think he'll be an excellent judge it's not that it is the overcoming the turning back of this tide of panic and hysteria this media war that has been waging it was a victory over panic and hatred and the end of due process and and identity politics it just made me feel bliss but there's plenty of other reasons the u.s. is now the most competitive country in the world regaining the number one spot for the first sign since the collapse in 2008 all this talk that the recovery started with Obama is garbage because the recovery started would have started under a stuffed cat it would have started under anybody when you have a crash in America our economy is so strong it always bounds back in accordance with the crash so normally when the crash comes if it's a bad crash like this one was the recovery is big and strong and very quick and it and that is the way it has always been Milton Friedman pointed this out it's the way it's always been with Obama he sat on the recovery with his stupid healthcare bill with his complete regulation of businesses with his changing regulations and his incredible red tape and now Trump is taking that off and the economy is soaring but in keeping with that I want to mention the death of Paul Allen who was Bill Gates's partner in founding Microsoft Bill Gates said that personal computing would not have existed without him there's a little bit of an obit that's really an op-ed an editorial in The Wall Street Journal today in which they pointed out that the these founding of Apple and of of Microsoft and Apple came in the 1970s when first of all anybody would have said that IBM was going to be the greatest computer company but instead Microsoft and Apple came to dominate the desktop computer revolution but as it says in the Senate or the late 1970s were also a time full of angst about whether America's best days were over right this was happening when Jimmy Carter when Richard Nixon was you know when Watergate was happening when Jimmy Carter followed he was Jimmy Carter was gave that famous speech where he said America isn't a malaise and where did it come from and everybody the left was saying oh my goodness America is uncover Noble and this was just before Ronald Reagan came all I want to say about this is this that conservatives are very good at reading the tea leaves and seeing disaster but you do not know what's coming and you do not know what is happening now you do not know who is sitting in his bedroom who is a 15 year old somewhere sitting as bedroom dreaming the dreams that are going to make a beautiful beautiful future that is why we leave people free to make those futures that is why we don't try to write the future or have the government demand or command what the future is but just let people dreaming up in their garages dream it up in their bedrooms and set them free to do the things that they have to do there's fracking here because we have property rights the Microsoft and Apple became so big because we have capitalism when these big companies get so big they start to become socialists why because that kills the competition and leaves the monopoly free to them we should not let that happen we should always always be some Horning the little guy who dreams and the only way to support that little guy is to keep people free keeps socialism out and keep corporations from becoming what they ultimately become which is a force of a power pool that wants to preserve its power all right the backstage is coming this
