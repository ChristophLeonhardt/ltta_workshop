we had this big talk about competency during the primary in the general election whether someone's emotionally or emotionally ready for the presidency whether they have any experience that can be applied to it and this this is a reminder day by day it might help us in this particular case but we should recognize that like where someone is that on the ideological spectrum is not the only important variable for how they will govern as president there are a lot of other important things government is complicated not all of it can be easily torn down into dueling ideologies you need to have someone who understands at least something about human nature something about political institutions if you're going to have a country that can survive to the next presidency that that's why I'm people cell pence is no better that's ideologically totally true in some ways worse and he's craftier and maybe you'll get more things done I understand all that I want pence out of the pulpit and on the mound immediately because this fool this Donald Trump idiot could get us in a war with I keep thinking North Korea's the most volatile area and the one who can most blunder into and then all we've lost several hundred thousand civilians if not millions of civilians before we know what happened before he can get his juice break so god we've got to get him out of there okay for the sake of the country now again that's not up to us he won the election the only thing is if if he if he you know if the investigations show that he has he'd made a deal with the Russians that's that's the only way to get him out there there's no fantasy world I heard on Fox that's not a crime yeah there's no fantasy world where he steps down because we because he's a danger to the world that just doesn't exist that's not a law yeah and and there's no fantasy world where he's replaced by someone other than Mike Pence so that good buddy we got to get him out he is on he just you know how stupid I think he is I think I'm the standard bearer for like if this is a spectrum on the one I'm on the very end of the spectrum for my respect for his intelligence right like everyone's not people I like yeah Jake now you're going overboard no there is no going overboard with how stupid he is but today I wouldn't even further out on that spectrum if you don't know that there are tax breaks for the wealthy in this bill you don't know shit you don't know anything anything a danger to the whole effin world man like and that guy who doesn't know that you think he knows anything about the intricacies of North Korea that if we get into some sort of you know conflict with North Korea that he's going to have the mental capacity to make one right decision up let alone that doesn't he have to make you can get proof just Google the worst debate answer in history and I break down him talking about the nuclear triad he has no anything he doesn't know as much as I just said in that sentence we were so close to a nuclear showdown in the Cuban Missile Crisis and some people wanted in the u.s. game a lot of people in the US government wanted us to wanted us to go in that direction and JFK barely avoided it by threading a needle this guy thread a needle are you kidding me no capacity whatsoever and look I some libs might now start to feel kind of bad for him because he's so unintelligent that he's like borders on some mental deficiency like literally literally so he start to feel bad for him he's he says you know he's slow he's whatever right he's like he's not even on slow he's on rewind but you can't feel bad for him you got to feel bad for the rest because he's in charge will feel bad for him after we get him treatment but in the meanwhile we gotta get him out he's unbelievable dangers of the world okay anyway yeah let's hope he did a deal with the Russians what do you get for Young Turks membership it's a mystery only one way to find out TYT Network comm /join
