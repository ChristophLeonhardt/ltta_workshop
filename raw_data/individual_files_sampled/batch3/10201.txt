well welcome to Sophie unco I'm Sophie Shepherd not say the plans to further integrate EU member-states together are clashing with the rising tide of anti-eu sentiment across the continent the latest being Italy where the euro skeptics are now forming the new government how will the continental Union come out of this well a sit-down with Matteo Renzi Italy's former prime minister to talk about this a shocking euro skeptic where Italy is sending ripples through Berlin Paris and Brussels throwing doubt on EU plans for tighter integration what will the blocks answer be to the spread of anti-eu sentiment how can popular discontent within the Union be soothed and will it force through radical change in Europe guarantee it's really great to have you in our program it's been a long time we're trying to get you as a guest so amazing that you're here lots to talk about so Italy is about to become the first EU country having a populist government first in you like there were attempts in other countries but never happen so the two parties that form the coalition they're gonna be in the government they represent everything you oppose what are your thoughts about it my view is that we need a very good relation between government and people but this relation will be based and focused not on the slow Ghana and easy promises but on the results concrete projects great opportunities in Italy the election show a country divided with a victory for two parties will create a new government my view is now it's time to verify if the promise and the slogan of electoral campaign will be project lows realisation in the in the life day by day so I'm a DA position but I'm really curious we will see if after a great electoral campaign with great proposed for the citizen those Papa lists will be able to achieve results when your party was offered to form a coalition with the five star movement you said it's absurd and now they're forming the government probably the next Prime Minister will be from the party - do you still think it's absurd or maybe it was worth it forming a coalition with them maybe you could have done great things together I think there are a great difference between five star movement and Democrat Party and the people who voted for five star movement represent an idea of development for Italy different respected the people world for them good party and vice versa so if five star movement and democrat party should be able to create a government together nobody could understand in Italy because we are their rival we were the rivals during electoral campaign I think after elections wins make a government who lost make opposition so the idea to create a government between two rivals it's very strange now it's time for the five star movement to create a government now it's time for them word party to make a position I open and I believe as soon as possible very very soon in my dreams in my hopes and also my ideas will come back the time for us to come back to the power to come back to create a government so when you came in power in 2014 it was like this big breath of fresh air because this young man comes after this long period of stagnation and you said I will demolish the establishment do you feel like you've actually were able to do I think this is normal in the life in 2014 Italy had a GDP of minus 2% now the GDP is almost plus 2% in four years every year we have one point of GDP positive this is different respect to the past I know all the countries have a very best performance better performance but I know Italy in 2014 was a country really really in troubles now is it a new country with more energy in economy when I start as Prime I served I start my service as prime minister in 2014 February the number of employed jobs are 22 millions in my country now is 23 millions one medium more so in this period we increase number of job level of GDP capacity to attract foreign investments tourism culture manufactory export I'm really happy for the results of my country I know when you became establishment it's more difficult to maintain the fresh image the fresh approach but I know the role of Prime Minister is not maintained good your image the role of Prime Minister is save your country so four years ago my surveys are better but the number of jobs in Italy are worst I prefer to change direction of economy to change the results of GDP than save my personal image for my purse image I have time to come back because we keep time so yes I hope I am so why I mentioned you promising to demolish the establishment visited these people who are now in power are also coming to power on anti-establishment slogans and when you look at their ideas on paper they're very radical so and they don't have a majority in the parliament so most probably the reforms that they're proposing will go we under out there go checks in the parliament so whatever you have the outcome of this reforms is not going to be what they're proposing right now do you feel like you come to power with this anti-establishment sentiment but then at the end the system never really lets you change things completely this is a good question for a lot of reasons the sentiment anti politicians and anti-establishment was particularly supported in the last period from the social media campaign and from use of social particularly dark in my view I'm a very great fan of social media I want III was one of the first to use the Facebook and Twitter and Instagram in my country I know in the last period in the last years a lot of people a lot of politician used the social media not for change the country but for bitch for change the citizens the mind of citizens stress the elements of criticism of skepticism our angry against the politician and establishment it's normal but I believe this is very dangerous why because if today the pop lists won't election thanks to this sentiment art establishment became establishment the risk to have the same reaction and the same impact in the citizens so I believe a very important try to be very honest and pragmatic there is a project for Italy and for Europe a platform a program who is able to respect the promise made to election he made it the citizen during elections this is the point so the governor the people win the election have a very great responsibility let me be very clear for the populism everything is easy until to arrive government for Manila pan is easy France to have the same slogans the same politics the same message if she is she wasn't she wasn't able to win the election because tonight today tomorrow the man called to solve the problem in France is not is very easy for alternative for Deutschland in Germany his expression against migrants against establishment against anger America because every day every night every month is Angela Merkel the woman who is able who have to be able to solve the problem in Italy the situation is different because the man and the woman women with able to change the things are the populist and I believe for the populist everything is easy until you in the end they win the election I'm also very curious to see how long they're gonna stay in power because I remember you proposed a constitutional change you weren't a streamline the chaotic Italian government system with 65 governments in 70 years but Italians didn't have it didn't want it why is that I lost a very important battle and a lot of my friends told me why you risk your role your job your chair for a constitutional reform usually a prime minister lost the job for economy in Italy economy finally knows I'm an impetus and importer recovery why you lost for constitutional or for because I think for Italy is absolutely important to simplify the system let me be very clear I love my country I think my country is the most amazing country on the world I am really fall in love with the ability of entrepreneurs in Italy of artisan culture men and women so I really I'm really really exciting food when III think about my country but at the same time I know Italy's is maybe one of the most complicated countries around the world in terms of organization you know sixty-five government in 71 year Italy is a kingdom of beauty our intelligence of passion of food of love of wine but in terms of political organization we are not the number one out of the water we are terrible complicated I try to change I lost I lost my job but I think this was a correct fight this was a current battle you can lose some battles but if we the courage to try to change you lost at the first day one so just like Churchill what can I say Churchill is a totally different thing but I think you have to try you have to try this is very important but obviously if you try you can win and you came fill out I think this battle for Africa City Sheriff Aaron Burr was correct but the citizens decide to vote now and so now it's time to for other people we will come back we're gonna take a short break right now when we come back we'll continue talking to Matteo Renzi Solis former prime minister will talk more about Italy's future and the future of the European Union stay with us and we're back with Matteo Renzi to list former Prime Minister Renzi I just want to get all my questions then I'll have one question about immigration and I would love to talk to you about the future of European Union because I know you're very outspoken about it and notoriously anti-migrant might have Shalini will probably be interior minister he's saying he's gonna kick out half a million people out of the country when you were Prime Minister you were also very tough on immigration and illegal refugees and immigrants do you think that's the way to go it's very easy play with the fears of the people and in the history Italians were migrants in the history of the United States of America a lot of people come from America from Italy apart very brilliant and generous men and women who wrote the history of United States in part criminals killers people from mafia in the history of Europe in 1990 50 90 60 a lot of Italians live the south of our country and went in a Belgium in France in Germany and a lot of people suffered for that so we know who these they difficulties to be migrant Italy is an incredible and gorgeous country in a very delicate position because we are a natural bridge between Europe and Africa and if the politics refuse to play a role in Libya because this happened after the terrible decision of circusy and Cameron to go in Libya in Hillary Clinton the United States of America remember Barack Obama in the Atlantic interview decided to write the interview make an interview not write a book about the mistakes of this decision the decision of Europe and also Italy because Italy with the president berlusconi decided to go make war in Libya and my view is that after this decision we open a gate not from Libya to Italy but from Africa to Europe this gate arrived for the lack of political governance in African particularly Libya and for the lack of vision of European leaders I remember the discussions with my colleagues in 2015 when I was Prime Minister please help not Italy please help these people who died in the besi a woman who died in the sea pregnant a child who died in the sea okay maybe I lost two three points in the survey in the elections but I prefer saved human life then saved two points in my industry what would you do right now I mean he's not this not means I think everyone could arrive in Italy I I consider priority block the people in Africa and give them the opportunity to be able to create a new life in Africa particularly because I think that's a long perspective what about now people coming to your country should they be sent a lot of the number of migrants are really significantly discreet so now the situation is absolutely better than the past but I believe all Europe is able to have a strategy comma strategy for migration Europe lost herself for that reason we proposed when I was Prime Minister and I opening government will config this approach a very clear message now it's time to budget in European Union and you know the money is very important for European discussion my compose was that Italy gave every year a lot of money for all the countries more or less 20 billion euros and the will received only 12 15 billion euros every year so the balance is 6 7 8 billion euros gave to the other countries in Europe if the other countries particularly the Eastern countries with the most important people who receive the money from Italy decided to stop the welcome more correctly don't start with a welcome of migrants ok we respect this decision this decision but please Italy stop with the money all there is a solidarity for everything money migrants value oh if there is a solidarity to bring the money and to refuse migrants this is not solidarity this as an approach acceptable I hope a new government will continue with this strategy because this is the only strategy in the brief period to help Italy and Greece and other countries in the living and the managing of migrant or migrant migration crisis so this migration crisis in my opinion is probably one of the reasons why the Euroskeptic movement is so big and Europe hmm I grew up in France okay so back then it will be unthinkable for marine lepen father to get platforms or to meet channels to ever be second runner-up in a presidential campaign UK is one example you cannot you can be cynical and ironic about but I mean it's an undeniable fact that this movements are gaining force do you feel like you the pro-european force is the traditional politicians in Europe can gather together and strike back or are these forces here to stay forever now on the European landscape I agree with you is very different a relation between France of today and France of yesterday and the same is about brexit referendum if you think about sports of north of UK and the difference between London and Manchester or Liverpool sports but I think our skeptic business is very different the number of migrants in France is unbelievable or respected to the number of migrants in Italy is not simply migrants the cause of us kept appeasement in part yes I'm at the same time I think in part is the lack of political vision of Europe this is very very important thing Europe is an incredible experience of peace and prosperity after centuries of war after centuries of a civil war between Italy France Germany finally Europe became the place piece of dialogue but in the last period where is to reduce to Europe to only technical approach only a technician vision I think Europe is a place of vision for the future a global vision for the future and in this way I believe absolutely crucial to be able to give a message of change in the political leadership or your change because changing ah the pants because something is different for the next generation studies together Erasmus is the best think realized by European leaders not parameters of Maastricht the human values human cultural human rights civil rights is a part of identity of Europe so if we continue to discuss only about parameters of Maastricht fiscal compact six parts and we don't we are not able to give to the next generation a reason for the which to be proud to be European this is the reason of your skepticism so we have a lot of single problem single issues surely migrants surely the lack of employment of an employment is one of the most important problem of my country but in general a part of Europe surely the lack of good relation between some cities and other cities particularly in the ballet in the suburbs surely this is true this is a part of course of capped appeasement Euroskeptic visa white economy in finance no because it is not working for many countries it is rewinding one formula it's correct also if you think about some countries very rich you see the crow hop of the skepticism so alternative food - in a Germany with a very good performance in economy it's a strange message so it's not only economy it's also economy it's also economy but it's not only economy in my country is not only a manís problem because the rich Northeast vote for a populist party has Allegan order please this is a time for Europe to come back to great values to great vision to great ideas and I believe ideas and ideals and I believe this is possible if the new generation of native European because I'm Italian I'm Florentine I'm Italian but my my passport is Italian and I were so proud to be Italian but I also proud to be European citizen the next generation will be the generation who come back Europe to a side of value and not a little side of government but Erin see thank you very much for this interview all the best of luck with everything hopefully so much back to the power and then give us interviewing absolutely so
