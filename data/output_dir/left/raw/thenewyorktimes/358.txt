1
00:00:12,190 --> 00:00:15,849
I'm R.L. Stine and I write 
the "Goosebumps" books.

2
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:22,559
Well, I spend a lot of time in this room.
This is sort of my shrine to myself.

3
00:00:22,559 --> 00:00:27,379
I try to have a lot of atmosphere
in my office in case kids come to visit.

4
00:00:27,379 --> 00:00:30,479
As you can see I have a 
three-foot-long cockroach.

5
00:00:30,479 --> 00:00:33,669
You don't see that very often
in too many offices.

6
00:00:33,669 --> 00:00:39,539
I tell everyone that I caught it under 
the sink, but no one's believed me so far.

7
00:00:48,450 --> 00:00:53,019
We moved every room in the apartment
to make room for the pool table,

8
00:00:53,019 --> 00:00:56,469
and I was so excited 
to have my own pool table.

9
00:00:56,469 --> 00:00:58,999
And I turned out to be horrible at it.

10
00:00:58,999 --> 00:01:00,500
I'm just terrible.

11
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:02,670
I guess I just don't get the
geometry.

12
00:01:04,030 --> 00:01:08,200
A designer who 
saw a picture frame

13
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:11,419
that was made with marbles 
like these shutters,

14
00:01:11,419 --> 00:01:14,730
and she had the idea, 
she said, "Oh, look at the picture frame,

15
00:01:14,730 --> 00:01:16,400
those would make great shutters."

16
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:19,650
We had those made
with the marbles in it,

17
00:01:19,650 --> 00:01:24,149
and it's really quite remarkable.
It's lovely when the sun comes through.

18
00:01:25,029 --> 00:01:28,119
And you can see I have two
ventriloquist dummies.

19
00:01:28,119 --> 00:01:32,389
So, of course, Slappy the evil dummy 
is my most popular character.

20
00:01:32,389 --> 00:00:00,000
And the other one looks just like
me. How weird is that?
