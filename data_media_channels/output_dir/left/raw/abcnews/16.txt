OBVIOUSLY THE LOCATION OF THE 

75
00:02:05,892 --> 00:02:06,159
NEWSPAPER.

76
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:07,093

BRAD GARRETT FROM THE FBI IS ON 

85
00:02:24,744 --> 00:02:25,478
THE PHONE.

86
00:02:25,478 --> 00:02:26,412
WHEN YOU HEAR THE LOCATION, THIS

87
00:02:26,412 --> 00:02:27,613
WAS INSIDE A NEWSPAPER WHERE 

88
00:02:27,613 --> 00:02:29,616
THIS ACTIVE SHOOTER SITUATION IS

89
00:02:29,616 --> 00:02:31,050
UNFOLDING, WHAT DOES THIS TELL 

90
00:02:31,050 --> 00:02:31,216
YOU?

91
00:02:31,216 --> 00:02:33,652
>> IT TELLS ME THAT THERE HAS TO

92
00:02:33,652 --> 00:02:35,054
BE SOMETHING IN REFERENCE TO THE

93
00:02:35,054 --> 00:02:35,321
NEWSPAPER.

94
00:02:35,321 --> 00:02:38,758
I WOULD LOOK AT WHAT THEY HAVE 

95
00:02:38,758 --> 00:02:40,026
RECENTLY PUBLISHED, IN 

96
00:02:40,026 --> 00:02:40,727
PARTICULAR TODAY.

97
00:02:40,727 --> 00:02:44,763
IF THERE'S SOMETHING IN AN 

98
00:02:44,763 --> 00:02:46,799
ARTICLE OR EDITORIAL THAT WOULD 

99
00:02:46,799 --> 00:02:48,735
LEAD THEM POTENTIALLY TO 

100
00:02:48,735 --> 00:02:48,968
SOMEONE.

101
00:02:48,968 --> 00:02:50,503
DID THE SHOOTER ACTUALLY SAY 

102
00:02:50,503 --> 00:02:52,639
SOMETHING BEFORE HE COMMITTED 

103
00:02:52,639 --> 00:02:54,007
THE SHOOTING.

104
00:02:54,007 --> 00:02:56,009
IT MAY ALSO GIVE THEM SOME 

105
00:02:56,009 --> 00:02:58,711
INSIGHT AS TO WHAT THE 

106
00:02:58,711 --> 00:02:59,145
MOTIVATION MIGHT BE.

107
00:02:59,145 --> 00:03:00,346
>> OBVIOUSLY WE DON'T KNOW A 

108
00:03:00,346 --> 00:03:01,314
MOTIVE AT THIS HOUR.

109
00:03:01,314 --> 00:03:02,548
WE CERTAINLY DON'T EVEN KNOW 

110
00:03:02,548 --> 00:03:05,151
WHETHER THERE IS ANYONE IN 

111
00:03:05,151 --> 00:03:05,384
CUSTODY.

CERTAINLY GOING TO BE PART OF 

117
00:03:15,227 --> 00:03:17,196
THIS INVESTIGATION, FIGURING OUT

118
00:03:17,196 --> 00:03:18,431
WHY SOMEONE WOULD GO IN AND 

119
00:03:18,431 --> 00:03:19,599
TARGET SOMEONE INSIDE THE 

120
00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:19,866

BE QUITE A WHILE DETERMINING 

287
00:50:03,633 --> 00:50:05,368
WHAT OCCURRED, WHY IT OCCURRED 

288
00:50:05,368 --> 00:50:06,937
AND HOW IT OCCURRED.

289
00:50:06,937 --> 00:50:09,773
AS THE GOVERNOR MENTIONED, WE 

290
00:50:09,773 --> 00:50:11,174

SHOOTER, WE DO HAVE FATALITIES 

293
00:50:15,812 --> 00:50:18,348
AND WE DO HAVE SERIOUS INJURIES.

00:50:18,348 --> 00:50:20,884
WE ALSO HAVE MANY, MANY 

295
00:50:20,884 --> 00:50:22,018
WITNESSES THAT ARE BEING 

296
00:50:22,018 --> 00:50:23,787

00:50:31,161 --> 00:50:33,096
WE HAVE -- WE ARE ASKING THEM TO

301
00:50:33,096 --> 00:50:34,498

00:50:34,498 --> 00:50:37,000
THEY CAN COME AND ASSIST THEM 

303
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:37,968
WITH GETTING HOME SAFELY.

304
00:50:37,968 --> 00:50:41,004
AS RYAN MENTIONED BEFORE, OUR 

305
00:50:41,004 --> 00:50:41,671
CRIMINAL INVESTIGATION DIVISION 

306
00:50:41,671 --> 00:50:43,473
HAS ONE PERSON IN CUSTODY.

307
00:50:43,473 --> 00:50:47,644
THAT PERSON IS AT OUR CRIMINAL

311
00:50:53,350 --> 00:50:54,817
QUITE FREQUENTLY AND SHORTLY I 

312
00:50:54,817 --> 00:50:55,452

THE BUILDING IS SECURE FROM A 

315
00:51:01,124 --> 00:51:01,992
TACTICAL STANDPOINT.

316
00:51:01,992 --> 00:51:04,561
THAT MEANS THAT RIGHT NOW WE 

317
00:51:04,561 --> 00:51:05,762
BELIEVE THAT THERE NO OTHER 

318
00:51:05,762 --> 00:51:07,631
SHOOTERS IN THE BUILDING, BUT IT

319
00:51:07,631 --> 00:51:10,033
HAS NOT BEEN CLEARED FROM AN 

320
00:51:10,033 --> 00:51:11,868

00:51:11,868 --> 00:51:14,638

00:53:07,217 --> 00:53:09,319
THEY ENGAGED THE SUSPECT ONCE 

383
00:53:09,319 --> 00:53:13,523
THEY ARRIVED AT THE SCENE.

384
00:53:13,523 --> 00:53:15,392

TO DECLARE ANYONE DEAD, BUT IT'S

394
00:53:34,344 --> 00:53:34,577

A SITUATION HE SAID WOULD BE 

415
00:54:10,814 --> 00:54:14,017
HARD TO DESCRIBE FOR A WHILE.
