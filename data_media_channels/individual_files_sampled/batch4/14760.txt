meet Leon Sela who in May 2015 was a Ryerson University student an elementary school teacher of Arabic and a future English teacher for orphans in Istanbul a promising professional right what if I told you she's also the person who tweeted may God ruin the homes of the Jew Salah served as the events coordinator at the Ryerson chapter of students for justice and Palestine which of course is the group funded by people who donated twelve point four million dollars to Hamas her idea of justice though it seems remarkably like incitement to violence and a rejection of solutions with which even many Palestinians agree along with tweeting may god ruin the homes of the jew - a hashtag tweet Palestinian expressions in English watchdog group canary mission reports Allah also said no to States will not be a solution just get the hell out it's been enough I want to go to Palestine and enjoy my country and yet this is the side of the argument that accuses Israel of ethnic cleansing well that is a clip from our new video series everyday called campus unmasked you can see it at campus unmasked calm the idea is to shine a light of scrutiny on the kind of political extremism that students face at universities and colleges in Canada the United States across North America not just anti-israel and anti-semitic extremism as we saw there but anti Western anti industry extreme anti-fur I adore Skol us to violence things like that and the host of this daily series is Rob shim shock who joins us now via Skype great to see you rob and congratulations on campus unmasked thanks so much thanks for having me well it's nice to introduce you to the rebel family you are a journalist you work with the Daily Caller a conservative based news organization in the States but every day you do a video for us now at campus on mast tell me how you choose your stories there's so many campuses there's so much insanity what are the kind of things you look for on a given day sure so as you're mentioned with campus unmask were really concerned about incitement to violence so uh but you'll see you're the left often pearl clutch over like offensive speech but really with camps and masks we're looking for incitement of violence and we're looking for stories that involve groups like Antipa we're looking for stories in which groups really perpetuate falsehoods then lead to incitement to violence so for instance we had a university professor recently reinstated who was attributing Isis and 9/11 to Israel and is this kind of language this really a dehumanizing language often that makes new targets right or violence on campus I had another story which I reported that a student columnist she branded off brat members rapists even though this is of course like a ludicrous allegation and so this is really the type of language that then you see leads to violence you see the perpetrators of violence use these language to use these false smears yeah and sometimes actual terrorists or terrorist supporters are taken on tour on campus I mean I I saw one video that we had on campus unmasked a little while back about I think it was the son of a terrorist who was on campus I mean so it's not just people who say crazy things like the Jew should be killed in their homes sometimes actual terrorist supporters or terrorist affiliates are put on tour through campus and paid for by students unions or by the universities themselves it's incredible who who goes on tour on campuses am i right right and what's most startling is you see these activists continually being elevated to these positions of teacher professor and I just wonder when are we gonna see in the in merriam-webster the synonym for professor be propagandist or some kind of charlatan and really as you're saying yeah I remember I've reported on in Antipa activist Yvette allarakha who she doesn't teach higher education but she does teach middle schoolers and she's recruiting students to go to protests she's committing violence herself she's been arrested for assault then of course you had the infamous Berkeley bike lock professor who assaulted someone out in California so you definitely have professors not even not just perpetuating this false information and kind of making the false equivalency between hate speech and actual violence but then themselves committing violence sometimes yeah it's incredible how sensitive the left is towards any words that they don't like I mean we've had the case in Canada at Laurier University with Lindsey Shepard simply showing a very calm video clip in a class the whole university came down on her like a ton of bricks so she's an athame but you can take anti rioting professors and not only are they fine they're subsidized I tell you Rob there's no shortage of material I mean you do a video every day but there are literally thousands of examples of extremists Pro violent leftists on campus I mean there's there's thousands am i right right that's true I've been looking into a couple professors recently by the name of George super elomar who's at Drexel University and Mark Bray who's a visiting professor with Harvard ugly earth talk over there Dartmouth one of the Ivy League institutions and both of these professors are really trying to normalize the U of Antipa as some kind of like cool hip revolutionary movement and really they're just disparaging any criticism that it's a violent heretical movement by saying that while they're responding to fascism so some measure of violence is necessary yes well you do a lot of the research yourself obviously you're a proven journalist you you come across as young and energetic but you're actually quite seasoned as a reporter and we're delighted to have you on the team but people can submit their horror stories through the website campus on mass so you're always scanning for stories but if someone at University of Toronto or University of Calgary or McGill or anywhere in the states has a story they can actually upload we call it a campus incident report form right on the home page there that people can use am i right yes definitely police send tips and certainly some of my best stories that come from tips I remember there was one professor who is tweeting Trump must hang and then he tweeted two Republicans should be two Republicans should be murdered for each immigrant supported and this was sent to me from an anonymous tipster hmm that's incredible well listen Rob we're thrilled to have you on the team your journalism is outstanding you're focusing on something that I think all our viewers are interested in but especially anyone who is a student themselves who has kids kids in college or it's just interested in what happens in the university today generally Hanson that happens to the general Society you know short years later folks if you want to watch Rob's a videos he does a video in a written story every day go to campus on mass comm you can sign up for emails there and if you want to support us it is a crowd-funded website so that's the place to do it last word to you Rob right I just encourage people to definitely get involved on campus and then you can fight back against these movements using your own speech not violence of course yeah definitely get involved and what you see it this stuff really doesn't mean that much if it's just contain definitely try to share it with a larger audience and so whenever this stuff blows up you do get actual impacts that Professor that I mentioned earlier he said Trump must hang and wanted to it was same to Holden should be killed for each immigrant aborted he actually did get put on after my stories so his stuff if you report can actually have real institutional shame wow that's amazing well congratulations I I mean it's it's almost like an endless battle there are thousands of bad guys out there and my bad guys I mean folks fomenting violence fomenting hatred on the left but the fact that you're having some success already is incredible Rob thanks so much for this and good luck thanks a lot that's right all right there you have it Rob shim shock he is our reporter on the campus
