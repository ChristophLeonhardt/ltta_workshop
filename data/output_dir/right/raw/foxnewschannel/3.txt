THE HOUSE IS BEING.

18
00:00:40,998 --> 00:00:43,833
IF THEY INVEST THIS MUCH EFFORT.

19
00:00:43,834 --> 00:00:45,702
NORTH CAROLINA DOESN'T HAVE A

20
00:00:45,703 --> 00:00:46,236
SENATE RACE.

21
00:00:46,237 --> 00:00:49,939
THEY DON'T HAVE A GUBERNATORIAL

22
00:00:49,940 --> 00:00:50,240
RACE.

23
00:00:50,241 --> 00:00:52,108
IT'S 1 OF 435 HOUSE RACES.

24
00:00:52,109 --> 00:00:53,243

00:00:55,746 --> 00:00:58,915
ONE OF THE ARE THE THINGS ABOUT

28
00:00:58,916 --> 00:01:00,750
THIS, JUST AS BARACK OBAMA

29
00:01:00,751 --> 00:01:02,619
FOUND, YOU CAN'T GO EVERYWHERE.

30
00:01:02,620 --> 00:01:05,021
THERE IS A LIMITED NUMBER OF

31
00:01:05,022 --> 00:01:05,355
PLACES.

32
00:01:05,355 --> 00:01:06,589
THIS IS NOT A GOOD TIME FOR

33
00:01:06,590 --> 00:01:10,326
DONALD TRUMP TO BE IN OHIO OR IN

34
00:01:10,327 --> 00:01:10,760

HIS NUMBERS ARE LOW.

38
00:01:17,134 --> 00:01:20,270
WHERE HE IS NOT SO POPULAR

39
00:01:20,271 --> 00:01:22,472
ANYMORE.

40
00:01:22,473 --> 00:01:27,877
NORTH CAROLINA WILL INCREASE

41
00:01:27,878 --> 00:01:31,447
DEMOCRAT INTENSITY BUT THERE ARE

42
00:01:31,448 --> 00:01:35,251

IT WAS CLOSE ONCE AND SCOTT HAD

56
00:02:02,346 --> 00:02:04,214

00:02:17,261 --> 00:02:20,096
THE TIME IS RUNNING OUT QUICKLY.

65
00:02:20,097 --> 00:02:22,098

DECIDE ELECTIONS NARROWLY.

73
00:02:36,747 --> 00:02:38,581
