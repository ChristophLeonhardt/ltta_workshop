Justin Trudeau put more time in planning in care into his week-long dress-up party then he did into any diplomatic or business purposes in India it was not a business trip it was a family vacation cosplay fantasy as the kids would say a dress-up party with the power and the riches of a g7 government behind them that's why it was so weird it's also weird because he doesn't quite get it here's a tweet by an indian man named Navdeep singh i don't know who Navdeep singh is but he's talking about the Trudeau playing dress-up with Christy Duncan a junior cabinet minister who came along let me read what Singh said he said eat the newly Wed Indian couple Justin Trudeau wearing Indian groom costume and Christy Duncan wearing typical Indian Bridal maroon dress standing outside Hindu temple and Trudeau wearing wedding necklace Indian wedding custom perfect look I have no idea what an Indian bridal costume looks like I mean maybe that's as ridiculous as someone wearing a long white flowing dress here I don't think Justin Trudeau has any clue either I just think he's in one big childlike week-long costume party fantasy and as long as his vanity photographer keeps shooting he'll keep posing he literally posed in costume with a Bollywood star named Shahrukh Khan who as you can see his dress normally he is not wearing an ethnic costume he doesn't do that haven't the Trudeau's dress up while a Bollywood actor does not that's about as cringy as I don't know if you met Harrison Ford and he was dressed normally but you would be wearing a Star Wars costume that's our manchild prime minister for you if you having trouble understanding how weird this all is imagine if some foreign leader came to Canada for a week and one day he was dressed up as a Mountie in a wet red outfit in there and a hat and then the next day he dressed in an Aboriginal outfit and then another day he dressed up as a full-on cowboy not at the Stampede or anything just as he was tooling around the country we think he was putting us on maybe even mocking us for sure he would think he was unserious a clown or at least a showboat or maybe a little bit touched that's an excerpt from my daily TV show the Ezra Levant show normally it's behind a paywall but I thought you'd like this video so we put it on YouTube if you want to subscribe to watch the daily show every day including all ways to interview today and I read my hate mail just click on this screen and become a Premium Member you
