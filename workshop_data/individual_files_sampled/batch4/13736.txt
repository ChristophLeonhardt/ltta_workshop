Jack Phillips understands the fact that you cannot transition your sex and so he doesn't want to create a cake that that celebrates this this this impossible thing which makes sense now in the months that followed the the bakery received requests for cakes featuring marijuana use sexually explicit messages and satanic symbols one solicitation submitted by email asked the cake shop to create a three-tiered white cake depicting satan licking a sex toy phillips believes that scar dina made all of these requests but in any case three weeks after Phillips won at the High Court the Commission issued a probable cause determination finding that there was sufficient evidence to supports c√°rdenas claim of discrimination and in a somewhat strange development the probable cause finding reads that Phillips violated state law even though the proceedings are still in a preliminary stage okay so this is a mean you've got this this man who not only called asking for this ridiculous cake but then it seems like proceeded to call many more times asking for increasingly vulgar and ridiculous cakes he is the one harassing Jack Phillips yet of course the Colorado Civil Rights Commission finds that Jack Phillips may well be discriminating against him
