in this game you'll need to know about
words access general lexicography and
airdrop about me wh really have so the
first one is LOL and that's it there
any ideas what it could stand for I
thought it might be a band of you must
have lots of love lots of love love on
leave or something no not that lots of
lollies
it means laugh out loud
this one is our Oh al
no next reflects work that's not that no
a neighbor saying roof on fire love I
learnt this wish a man named Roland no a
rotten old death of something it could
be what would the ethany L stand for
through old rev ah
floral and the L
launch ok this stands for rolling on the
floor laughing F T W the same sure thing
it's not about laughing this one though
I love the waves
it's not nice is it my idea better right
no but the burr that is right for the
world for the world you've now got to
write
it's for the something 5 to win okay
right I'm going to say that ticket What
did he say five to give to women well
together you got that right because it
actually so for the win for the win it's
when something goes well for you if you
succeed it was for the win
okay this next one is OMG old man going
how could say I'm oh good you're correct
yeah but I'm like it oh my god
that's what it stands for okay this
one's a bit more of a tricky one
it's ttyl detail why the title but TT is
right tattle and you're all quite close
in terms of it's something that you
would end a conversation with TT it be -
Z - Z
talk to later
correct well done Fred pleasure that
stands for talk to you later be TW
abusive we don't know go a message
you're a bloody Twitter be there
Wednesday that's a very good one
I would it's not the right one I would
more likely use it for that then by the
way by the way correct Fred got it
well done you're on the bull with this
by the way yeah I feel it to me yeah
what well done Fred I f K any other king
and country
no ping pong over there it's away from
keyboard so if you were leaving the
computer you would be away from the
keyboard
this one is a s L I'm going to give a
clue of this I'm so long Hagen and so
wrong of will you were commenting on the
game from it that it's not that no Oh
sexist allowed now nearly I'm the middle
one the S is it actually doesn't mean
sex
whoever not that silly two toilets
it's not know the middle one stands for
sex as in the male war PDA yes so these
two are other questions that you would
ask someone when getting to know them
love to shake lay down yeah
I assumed you'd already be laying down
but it stands for age so what is your
age you're sexy you're male or female
and location where do you live so it's
age sex or location I M H Oh
gently going home immediately going home
it's not that no just oh I uh no it's
not
I must hop off that's a very good one
it's not though okay it's in my honest
opinion that's all it stands for this is
an TL Dr to their back not a family
oh you're right they'll check you know
the T does stand for two though it is
something you would say if you were
given a lot a lot to read and you didn't
fancy it what would you say wrong guru
proof okay you got the first two right
too long dry rot no okay it stands for
you were very close so I'll give you
half points of that
and three that was it that was it I was
very good and it's it stands for too
long don't read yes so if you ever see
anything it's gates he LDR and then you
sound pretty hip
you
