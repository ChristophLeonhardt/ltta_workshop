1
00:00:05,190 --> 00:00:08,670
Just last week, this land
was filled with villages,

2
00:00:08,670 --> 00:00:11,890
rice paddies and farms.

3
00:00:11,890 --> 00:00:15,720
Now, this is what’s left.

4
00:00:15,720 --> 00:00:21,480
Debris, livestock and
somewhere hundreds of people

5
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:24,820
stranded, missing or dead.

6
00:00:24,820 --> 00:00:27,520
This is Laos, a
single-party communist

7
00:00:27,520 --> 00:00:30,550
country that is one
of the poorest in Asia.

8
00:00:30,550 --> 00:00:33,100
On Monday, part of
a hydroelectric dam

9
00:00:33,100 --> 00:00:35,950
that was still under
construction collapsed.

10
00:00:35,950 --> 00:00:39,400
Water flooded the villages,
killing at least dozens

11
00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:43,225
and forcing thousands to flee.

12
00:00:43,225 --> 00:00:46,560
The journey here was
rough, with constant rain

13
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:47,775
and backbreaking roads.

14
00:00:50,510 --> 00:00:55,070
Challenging, especially
for rescue workers.

15
00:00:55,070 --> 00:00:57,920
We arrived in the tiny town
of Khom Kong, where

16
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:00,530
only hours earlier the
water levels had been up

17
00:01:00,530 --> 00:01:03,110
to the roofs.

18
00:01:03,110 --> 00:01:06,230
Villagers and soldiers trudged
through knee-high mud,

19
00:01:06,230 --> 00:01:08,362
at times not sure what
they were looking for.

20
00:01:11,736 --> 00:01:14,070
Lim Thong had spent
the past few nights

21
00:01:14,070 --> 00:01:16,792
sleeping on the roof
of his family’s shop.

22
00:01:16,792 --> 00:01:18,750
He and his wife
Wan Pheng were

23
00:01:18,750 --> 00:01:22,370
digging through the debris
to salvage what they could.

24
00:01:34,027 --> 00:01:36,360
Laotian Army rescue teams
are still searching in patrol.

25
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:42,120
Four days on, they say they’re
more likely to find bodies

26
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:43,560
than survivors.

27
00:01:47,420 --> 00:01:50,480
A few hours away, survivors
gathered at a school

28
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:52,850
for shelter.

29
00:01:52,850 --> 00:01:56,680
Earlier this week, the Laos
government said 27 had died

30
00:01:56,680 --> 00:01:59,630
and 131 are still missing.

31
00:01:59,630 --> 00:02:02,750
But experts say these numbers
are suspiciously low,

32
00:02:02,750 --> 00:02:06,900
and the reality here
may be a lot worse.

33
00:02:06,900 --> 00:02:08,479
The failure of
the dam, which was

34
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:10,490
part of a billion-dollar
project meant

35
00:02:10,490 --> 00:02:12,320
to boost the
country’s economy,

36
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:14,390
raises many questions.

37
00:02:14,390 --> 00:02:16,370
Who’s to blame
for the collapse?

38
00:02:16,370 --> 00:02:19,450
And why weren’t these
towns evacuated faster?

39
00:02:19,450 --> 00:02:21,470
But as the rains
continue to come,

40
00:02:21,470 --> 00:02:25,040
and rescue teams still
search for the missing,

41
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:26,990
villagers can only
wait for the waters

42
00:02:26,990 --> 00:02:29,120
to lower and hope
that they’ll still

43
00:02:29,120 --> 00:00:00,000
have a home to return to.
