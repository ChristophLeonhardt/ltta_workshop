Democrats lose their mind about Brett Cavanaugh's nomination Bob Woodward's book launches and Paul Krugman says Republicans are here to steal your health care oh happy day i'm ben shapiro this is the ben shapiro show today this very tumblr will be filled endlessly with the tears of all of the people at the Senate Judiciary Committee hearing it is fully insane over there where all the women have been reduced to the status of menial slaves under president pence and justice Kavanagh has forced them all into the back alleys for their abortions we'll talk about all of those things but first let's talk about what you're going to do during this incipient disaster as Brett Kavanaugh about to join the Supreme Court and reduce us all to penury to living in our homes having to eat from food storage well what are you gonna do when that happens the answer is you're gonna need my Patriot supply because the reality is that regardless of what the disaster is whether it's Brett Kavanaugh being appointed to the Supreme Court or whether it's net neutrality or whether it's actually just like an actual natural disaster where you can't leave your house or go to the grocery store you're going to need something in your house to get you through those times the answer cannot be to run to the grocery store in a lot of emergency situations because the shelves are already empty or the place is closed this is why you need my Patriot supply for food storage so you'll be ready for earthquakes hurricanes long term power outages and more here's a great special that makes it simple each person in your household should have a two-week emergency food supply from my Patriot supply the kits are only 75 bucks right now they contain ninety two servings of breakfast lunches and dinners take action

Kavanaugh hearings is upon us Brett Kavanaugh of course is president Trump's nominee to replace Justice Kennedy yesterday I mistakenly said who's gonna replace Scalia but that of course was justice Gorsuch he is there to replace Justice Kennedy and the left is going nuts over this because oh my god an establishment Republican but the most establishment of credentials is going to sit on the Supreme Court and there's nothing they can do to stop it there's nothing they can do to stop it because Harry Reid back in 2013 like an idiot utilize the nuclear option in order to get through a bunch of judicial nominees by President Obama over the filibuster so now it only requires 51 votes to put somebody on a federal court the Republicans have those 51 votes they will be using them for Brett Kavanaugh he will indeed sit on the nation's highest court now hilarious about all of this is the levels of panic to which the left have been rising in the in the last couple of days are fully crazy I mean fully fully crazy well show you some of that panic in just a second but Brett Kavanaugh is sitting there answering questions like what do you think about roe v wade and he's saying it's precedent and then he's asked about Planned Parenthood versus Casey and he says it's precedent on a precedent this does not sound like a dude who's going to overturn roe v wade this was always my criticism of judge Brett Kavanaugh I didn't think that he was the most right leaning person that the Republicans could have picked the most originalist person Republicans could have picked I think he'll be a pretty good judge I think he'll be a pretty good justice I don't think that he's going to be Thomas or Scalia I'm not sure that he's a solid vote to overrule roe v wade but it doesn't matter what he says at this point because the Democrats have basically already made up their mind and judicial hearings are useless because we now have something called the so the the the Ginsburg rule which is has been in place for some thirty years basically you can't expect a judge to answer questions about how they will decide an upcoming case or even what they really think of past precedent instead they just say it's precedent which is a legal description of the state of the law Roe is precedent but precedent is not binding on the Supreme Court because the Supreme Court can simply overrule precedents any time that it wants so all of this is to say that these judicial hearings are a complete waste of time they're utter nonsense that are waived for the for the Senators to grandstand and apparently for them to bring in all of their crazy friends to grandstand as well the hearings were interrupted in the first 40 minutes 44 times yesterday by various Democrats shouting out interruptions also there are a bunch of people who decided to shout at Brett Kavanaugh in the room people like Piper Perabo who's not been relevant since what coyote ugly she got arrested yesterday in the worst performance ironically since coyote ugly she got arrested yesterday Linda Sarsour of the women's March was also arrested in the room she was dragged out kicking and screaming and you know she is she's a delight and every in every possible way so all of these radicals in the room getting getting dragged away it's it's just it's just terrific it's just terrific here's some video of the protesters screaming because that was delightful we're not any negative patient and what chairman Leahy did during justice Kagan's this is another example of confidential documents or really interesting seeing them in the first place so here's the rule I think they should apply I think the rule they should apply here is that if you invited anybody in who disrupts the hearing you don't get to invite anybody in anymore if you are one of the Democratic senators and you allowed Code Pink to come in you'll add Linda Sarsour to come in then she got herself arrested because she's a dolt then you don't get to invite anybody anymore because that's not what these hearings are for if you want a protest there's plenty of space outside for you to protest your protests will be useless because this is a democratic process not a protesting and shouting process but screaming and whining are the way that the Democrats are dealing with the fact that they are not going to be able to get Merrick garland on the court to replace a Republican appointee like Justice Kennedy here is video of Linda Sarsour getting arrested yesterday she again is as delight catch you later Linda okay if you can understand what they're saying then you are a you have better hearing than I do all I hear is the shrieking of of some sort of primeval creature in the middle of an in the middle of a hearing room these are humans and I'm not calling her an animal all I'm saying is that shrieking is inaudible there is no way for you to tell what she is saying because she's shrieking like a the people in the room you're right everybody on that on that on that panel Orrin Hatch's going you know what I've changed my vote because Linda Sarsour is shrieking at me people in the middle of the country they're thinking yes disaster is disaster thy name be Brett Kavanaugh moderates in the middle of the country independence in the middle of the country they are thinking the apocalypse is upon us so now we've been told by the Democrats that women and trans folks will die because of Brett Kavanaugh everybody was going to die because of net neutrality everybody already died because of the tax cuts I mean how many times can people die already is it's wild it's it's it's pretty amazing stuff all of this should also remind you it should also remind you that when we get all of this nonsense from the left and from some members of the right about civility and our politics Trump being the beginning and end of civility in our politics he's the one who ruins civility yeah sure yeah right it's all about Trump this is what bugged me about the McCain funeral where he had George W Bush and Barack Obama standing up there kind of creating this mythologized past where everybody sort of got along and I was talking with a friend this morning about what bothered me about that idea so much and what bothered me about the idea is that there are those of us who actually believe that politics matter and all these politicians prey on us because what they do is they say you're right politics do matter and so you got Joe Biden on the Left saying we'll put y'all back in Chains and folks on the right saying this will be the end of the country unless we do something that's apocalyptic rhetoric from people on both sides of the aisle because they're saying yes you are right politics do matter and then as soon as somebody comes along and says you're right politics matters we're gonna fight this like a war you've been using this apocalyptic rhetoric this is going to be a political war we're gonna fight this like a war then they say well hold on we don't want to do that and so they've been they've been basically doing this WWE routine for a very long time where you have every major politician from both parties speaking like WWE wrestlers but then telling people they ought to take it seriously that it's not fake that in reality these issues actually matter and then when the people take those issues seriously and then when they elect a guy who is not a politician who takes the things seriously like Trump actually the personal conflict seriously regardless what you think of the guy then they say well no no he didn't understand that this was all part of the game didn't understand he missed it didn't understand was all part of the game there's a movie with Robert De Niro called the fan a long time ago about this kind of it's it's about a guy who is a fan of a baseball team and his baseball team is about to go to the World Series I think this is how the plot works and Robert De Niro is a fan of the baseball team and he is so enamored with his team's chances of making the World Series that he goes and he kidnaps the opposing star on the other baseball team and everybody in the world is like why would you possibly do that he's like well because I want my team to win because he took the conflict too seriously I feel like that's sort of what we've done with our politics a little bit which is we now root for the opposing teams the difference being their actual consequences to which team wins or losses and so you got the left claiming at the end of the world is nigh and the right claim in the end of the world is nigh and then the minute that somebody like Trump comes along and says okay fine if the end of the world is nigh let's treat this like the brawl that it is then all of a sudden people on both sides of the aisle they go whoa wait up wait up a second wait up a second we didn't really mean that stuff and so cool if you didn't mean it then why did you say it I agree the end of the world is not nigh I agreed that we're not at the end of the country I agree we're not on the verge of Civil War I think there are serious divisions about the future of the country but I think that most Americans are not engaged in those serious divisions I think that's an intellectual superstructure that really cares deeply about those divisions I think most Americans are just going about their daily business making basic assumptions about American life that that reflect the essential founding values of the country but I think there is this intellectual upper class where they have these battles and they know that it's Kabuki theater and then in the backroom they get a drink together but they don't let anyone else in on the secret that it's Kabuki theater in reality the actual Kabuki theater should be them getting along and they should be bashing each other again I find all of this really tiresome so what what politics really does look like in the country the way people feel right now is like Linda Sarsour the way people feel in the country is like Donald Trump they feel like that they like the wrestling is real that's what they feel like because you know what when it comes to the consequences the wrestling actually Israel and the fact that our politicians didn't take it as real for so long and preyed upon that impression to create enthusiasm for their mission while all the time knowing that they were just exaggerating the case that's what's created everybody bought into their vision everybody bought into the wrestling is real meme and now the wrestling is real once everybody believes the wrestling is real then they're gonna start brawling and that's basically where we are right now down to the point where everyone is now become delusional the left is fully delusional about these cabinet hearings and when I say delusional there were two stories that started making the rounds yesterday both of which are completely completely insane so Story number one is there is a woman named Xena Bosch Xena Bosch is a half Mexican half Jewish White House staffer and she is married to a US attorney I believe and Xena Bosch was sitting behind Brett Cavanaugh during these hearings and the left began claiming that she was making a white power symbol behind Brett Kavanaugh I kid you not this thing within a couple of hours this video of Xena Bosch who is legitimately just putting her hand on her arm they're saying she's making a covert White Power symbol for no reason just because that's her sitting racism or something like they've still not explained why exactly even if she wired white supremacist which she is not she's again a half Mexican half Jewish person Y example grandparents survived the Holocaust like why exactly she would be making a white power symbol behind Brett Kavanaugh is beyond me but they claimed that she was legitimately making a white power symbol behind Brett Kavanaugh and there were a thousand tweets about this right the left began tweeting about this incessantly major blue checkmark figures on the left began tweeting about all of this it's it's just insane the ACLU tweeted out spread the word its hashtag not okay neo-nazis are using the okay hand gesture in commutes to communicate a hateful message when using the gesture the fingers form letters wnp which stand for white power do not use this hand gesture it's not okay okay Barack Obama has used this hand gesture you see what I'm doing right now this is not a white power symbol I've been using the hand gesture for okay for my entire life as have you as have your parents because that's not a thing in fact the ADL recognized this is not a thing the anti-defamation league okay this is what they this is what they wrote back in September 2018 they updated it yesterday has the simple thumb and forefinger okay hand gesture become a common white supremacist hand signal not quite but it has become a popular gesture used by people across several segments of the right and far right including actual white supremacist who generally use it to trigger reactions or what they would describe as trolling the libs this is thanks to a 20-17 hoax campaign started by members of the notorious website 4chan that has since taken on a life of its own I'm gonna explain a little bit more about this in just one second but first let's talk about your use of stamps so listen I know I know that you love the post office but you probably don't want to go down to the post office spend the time in the car the whole deal instead why don't you just do all of your postage from your desk it's a lot easier and stamps calm brings all the great services of the post office directly to your desk 24/7 when it's convenient for you you can buy and print official US postage for any letter any package using your own computer and printer mail carrier picks it up just click print mail you're done couldn't be easier stamps calmly use it here at the Daily wire offices it's great it saves us all sorts of time which for us means money and right now when you use promo code Shapiro you get up to 55 bucks a free postage a digital scale and a four week trial go to stamps calm before you do anything else click on the radio microphone at the top of the homepage type in Shapiro that stamps comm again promo code Shapiro stamps comm promo code Shapiro stamp Stockholm is a great way to ensure that you are saving all the money you need to save and you don't actually have to go out to the post office just do it for me to ask stamps comm use promo code Shapiro for the special deal so the ADL continues by saying this is all thanks to a 27 hoaxes campaign started by members of the notorious website 4chan that has since taken on a life of its own the 4chan site is an anonymous discussion board with an outsized cultural impact on the internet it has been responsible for everything from the I Can Has Cheezburger cat meme to the concept of rickrolling there's little chant there is little that four channels like as much as a hoax and in recent months they've served up a number of faker ease with white supremacist themes to to largely credulous online audiences the okay hand gesture originated is one of these hoaxes in February 2017 when an anonymous 4chan er announced to operation Oh KKK telling other members we must flood Twitter and other social media websites claiming the OK hand sign is a symbol of white supremacy the user even provided a helpful graphic showing how the letters white power could be traced within an okay gesture I believe the way that it works is you can see it here in the in the ACLU meme supposedly it's like if you go like this then this is a w-4 like white and then I guess the power is like that thing I okay the whole thing is trolling the whole thing is stupidity it's all reddit making fun of you it's all fortune making fun of you and the entire left fell for it they said that Xena Bosch was responsible for white supremacy again a half Mexican half the Jews are so clever that they activated a half Mexican half Jewish person to unleash a white power symbol to hit the media and get Brett Kavanaugh nominated I guess something like that but there are a bunch of people on the Left who tweeted this stuff out like a lot of them if this became an actual thing on Twitter Keith - Keith - Maya or dumbass is the case maybe who is she what's up with the white power sign at MSNBC it's got to work in tweeted out it's the biggest mistake I've ever made real Donald Trump said after having to condemn a fellow white supremacist after charlottesville just in case you were wondering what side trump's on its on the side of the nazis the same side Republicans in Congress are on and then somebody replied so are some of the hearings notice her hand WTF okay you guys are idiot you guys are idiots this is like the left's pizza gate there they're idiots on all sides they're conspiracy theorists on all sides this is just the latest conspiracy theory but it is not the only conspiracy theory so there's another conspiracy theory going around yesterday there's promoted by a guy named Fred Guttenberg Fred Gutenberg's daughter was killed tragically in the parkland shooting in an act of tremendous evil obviously and Gutenberg is a motivated leftist he's been a motivated leftist for a long time and Guttenberg basically went to this hearing with the sole intention of trying to get Brett Kavanaugh not nominated he tweeted in advance that he wants to see Brett Kavanaugh not nominated and he was going to the hearing to try and stop that so he tweeted out here's what he tweeted he tweeted just walked up to judge Kavanagh as morning session ended put out my hand to introduce myself as Jaime Gutenberg's dad he pulled his hand back turned his back to me and walked away I guess he did not want to deal with the reality of gun violence okay this flew around the internet I mean flew around the internet chris cuomo claimed that this was a true story chris cuomo did a whole story about how Kavanagh had ignored fred Guttenberg all this was just Cavanaugh being vial to the parents of a parkland survivor yeah CNN is not fake news that they're just annapolis an apple and a bananas and banana and CNN is news not fake news news here's Chris Cuomo again really gaining on his brother in the dumb Cuomo brothers race he last week Andrew had pulled had like Secretariat but now here it comes like Man O'War up from behind pretty amazing stuff anyway here's Chris Cuomo giving credence to this story which turns out to be a fool why the judge should be asked why well justice is supposed to be blind but that means I'm biased not ignoring what is right in front of your face why did you do that I don't mean to indict him he may have a good reason it may have no reason may say I don't even know what you're talking about I didn't even know it was going on I just want to get out of there maybe but we need to hear it why because I hope that in Cavanaugh's mind Gutenberg didn't represent a set of beliefs that he finds so threatening but he couldn't even make contact that's why the judge oh my oh my god so judge Cavanaugh now has to explain why a Rando I mean it lets me Atlas beard opens Fred Gutenberg is not a famous person if you met Fred Gutenberg on the street you would have no idea who he was you were more likely to know who Steve Guttenberg is than who Fred Guttenberg is you have no clue who Fred Guttenberg is you've probably never seen his face this is not a famous human being it's not like Brad Pitt walked up to him and extended his hand okay it's a guy who would have to explain who he was now here is the actual video of what happened from inside the room you will see that this is not what happens okay judge Kavanagh is excused what you're gonna see here is judge Cavanaugh gets up Gutenberg approaches him from behind extends his hand Kavanagh turns to look at him and see what's going on and then security grabs him okay security is already on him and Cavanaugh walks away okay that's what happens there it's not that he stands there and then refuses to shake his hand you can see here comes security from behind to grab Cavanaugh now I have been in positions many positions in crowded areas where people are assuring me out of a room and people want to shake my hand this happens to me at university campuses all the time and if somebody extends their hand and security walks up to them I'm not gonna walk over there I assume that security is doing that for a reason do you really think that Brett Kavanaugh is really like you know what I can't shake this guy's hand because I know who he is and I just stain him I disdain him do you really think that that's credible in any way again you can see the video from behind as security runs up to grab Guttenberg because he's running up at a break to try and shake Cavanaugh sand again this was all planted this is all done on purpose Guttenberg said in advance that he was attempting to sink Cavanaugh's nomination and then suddenly he got exactly what he wants when Cavanaugh supposedly stiffs him what absolute horse crap it's just horse crap in the video shows that it's horse crap Cavanaugh had to change his story I mean not Cavanaugh Guttenberg had to change his story originally he claimed that Cavanaugh clearly hurt him and then cabin I decided to walk away then he claimed that maybe Cavanaugh didn't hear him it didn't matter he was featured all over the news last night all of this is sheer nonsense it's sure nonsense so Ben Sasse apparently now has to explain to Democrats how these judicial hearings are supposed to work and here is Ben Sasse senator from Nebraska giving a bit of an education to folks on how these hearings are supposed to work and how dumb these hearings have become I want to make just four brief points number one in our system the legislative branch is supposed to be the center of our politics number two it's not third consequence is that this transfer of power means the people yearn for a place where politics can actually be done and when we don't do a lot of big actual political debating here we transfer it to the Supreme Court and forth and finally we badly need to restore the proper duties and the balance of power from our constitutional system okay and he's right about all these things but we're not gonna do any of that stuff instead what we're gonna do is shout at each other and pretend that Fred Guttenberg got stiffed by Brett Kavanaugh and scream until were arrested and all the rest of this nonsense because the apocalyptic rhetoric is the is the name of the game it's what we are all supposed to focus in on and then as soon as anyone takes the apocalyptic rhetoric seriously and and says you know what I don't like you anymore because we're not gonna be friends we're not gonna pretend to be friends because hey the country is at stake then it's well don't you get the game don't you get how the game works you can't have it both ways either you can use the apocalyptic rhetoric and take this thing seriously or you could actually use true rhetoric and then maybe we could be a little bit civil to one another and not everything is the apocalypse and I'm sorry judge Brett Kavanaugh joining the Supreme Court is far from the apocalypse it is really really far from the apocalypse in just a second I'm gonna give you the latest on Bob Woodward who has a new book coming out and this of course has the left and it's his he because at any time there's a gossip book about the president they're up for it but first let's talk about a sexy topic your air filters I know you're thinking right now why do I want to think about my air filters the answer is because you haven't thought about it for a while and you're probably breathing gunk the reality is you need to go check out your air filters right now open up that vent what you're gonna see is a dirty air filter because you haven't replaced it forever which is why you need to head over to my friends over at filter buy this is especially important with 95% of the glow population breathing unsafe air so do the smart thing go to filter by comm America's leading provider of HVAC filters for homes and small businesses choose from over 600 sizes including custom options that chip free within 24 hours plus they support working Americans manufacturing all their filters right here in the United States save five percent when you subscribe for auto replacement so you'll never forget to change those filters ever again you will always ensure that you're breathing clean air filter by will save you time and money and you're gonna breathe better and apparently become more intelligent in the process I mean that's that's apparently what's happened all the folks at the office since we replaced the filters with filter by so stop procrastinating right now that's filter Bui com filter by comm tell them I sent you again its filter by comm filter bu ID I kind of get on that auto schedules to save five percent and then you never have to think about your filters ever again it's the meanwhile while all of this is going on the media are in a tizzy about President Trump as always because we now suffer from wilds at Trump derangement syndrome in the media Bob Woodward has a new book and his new book basically says that Trump is a senile old crazy person who doesn't know what he's doing which is not much of a claim since I think the entire two left thinks that and I think large swaths of the right have basically priced in all of the typical Trump craziness into whatever it is that President Trump does nonetheless we're going to hear all these stories about the chaos that is president Trump that I think the funniest part of this is the Bob Woodward it's a Trump is denying any of this is true members of his administration are denying any of this is true General James mad dog mattis says that Woodward is reporting on him is fiction and quote a product of someone's rich imagination because Woodward wrote the Matis once described Trump as having the understanding of a fifth or sixth grader when it comes to the Korean Peninsula mattis responded by saying the contemptuous words about the president attributed to me in Woodward's book were never uttered by me or in my presence while I generally enjoy reading fiction this is uniquely Washington brand of literature and his anonymous sources do not lend credibility this is not supremely shocking stuff Woodward is gonna claim people said stuff people in the administration didn't claim they didn't state say stuff this is the problem with anonymous sourcing it's he-said she-said according to the book mattis said after a meeting at which from questioned the US government spending money on the Korean Peninsula mattis supposedly said that he was exasperated and alarmed and he told close associates the president acted like and had the understanding of a fifth or sixth grader apparently the defense Chiefs said in his statement responsible policymaking in the real world is inherently messin messy though it is also essential that we challenge every assumption to find the best option he says in serving this administration the idea would show contempt for the elected commander-in-chief President Trump or tolerate disrespect to the office of the president from within our Defense Department is a product of someone's rich imagination so Madison already throwing shade at Bob Woodward's book but that's not stopping the press we're having a field day with all of this presidents from conversation with Bob Woodward Woodward apparently called up Trump and wanted to know why Trump wouldn't be interviewed for the book and from basically shied it off he basically says you know you didn't go through the proper channels here's Trump trying to pretend that Canton heard about Woodward's book and then saying that he did hear about Woodward's book we didn't want to talk to him the reality is Trump doesn't have to talk to to Bob Woodward there's nothing there that suggests that that Trump has to for any reason talk to Bob Woodward it's just another book that smacks the president know shot here people and like Kellyanne and Raj in Republican senators I mean nor the senators no they never called me about senator Graham said he had talked to you about talking to me now is that not true senator Graham actually mentioned it quickly on one meeting and that is true well that no but that is true so basically there's Trump basically saying I was mentioned to a lot of people that I should talk to you I've decided not to or if somebody else's fault would release the tapes basically to show that his research is true and then he has tapes from a lot of these people regardless I'm not saying anything in the book that is anything different from what people already believe about President Trump so for example the Washington Post reports a central theme of the book is the selfie machination is used by those in Trump's inner sanctum to try to control his impulses and prevent disasters both for the president personally and for the nation who's elected to lead woodward describes an administrative coup d'etat and a nervous breakdown of the executive branch with senior aides conspiring to pluck official papers from the president's desk so you couldn't see or sign them again and again woodward recounts at length how trumps national security team was shaken by his lack of curiosity and knowledge about world affairs and his contempt for the mainstream perspectives of military and intelligence leaders in one particular situation supposedly Gary cone actually took a document off of Trump's desk to prevent him from fighting which is actually somewhat hilarious and so there's all these stories about how how his advisers are basically attempting to rein President Trump in is all this believable of course this stuff's believable I'm not gonna sit here and pretend it's not believable that his advisors are all trying to rein him in and prevents him from doing dumb things that's not a shock in in any real way and Woodward reports on some of these overdramatic moments of escalation when Steve Bannon for example started screaming at Ivanka Trump calling her a GD staffer and saying you walk around this place act like you're in charge or not you're on staff and I found could Trump replying I'm not a staffer I'll never be a staffer and the first daughter and Reince Priebus saying when you put a snake in a rat in a falcon in a rabbit and a shark and a seal in a zoo without walls things start getting nasty and bloody okay I mean all this stuff like frankly who cares I I got to be honest with you who cares wait did you not know this is going on did you not really believe this is going on do you really believe that this place functions like a well-oiled machine of course it doesn't function like a well-oiled machine it functions like the set of The Apprentice except without all of the good editorial cuts it functions like what left got left on the cutting room at the apprentice because that's how Trump runs things hey and so far the economy is fine and we're on the middle of any foreign crisis and things are basically okay I will say the feeling of chaos from the Trump administration is really what's hurting president Trump's approval ratings now the latest the latest revelations from Woodward's book come courtesy of a cos so this is this is what Woodward writes the operations of the Oval Office and White House were less the art of the deal and more often the unraveling of the deal the unraveling was often right before your eyes at Trump rally on continuous loop there was no way not to look so here is some of the stuff that that would reports Trump to James clapper then Director of National Intelligence who briefed him at Trump Tower during the transition on the intelligence community's findings that Putin had interfere in the election quote I don't believe in human sources these are people who have sold their souls and sold out their country I don't trust human intelligence and these spies so he didn't believe but we know that he tweeted that stuff out already I think okay apparently secretary mattis said secretaries of the defense don't always get to choose the president they work for okay why would that be shocking Trump said to Tom Bossert the president's advisor for homeland security cyber security and counterterrorism who asked Trump if he had Minute quote I want to watch the Masters your cyber are gonna get me in a war with all your cyber bleep alright I mean like again baked into the cake man everybody knew all this stuff Trump was given a Reader's Digest version of the Hezbollah briefing and we knew this has been reported for years that Trump basically takes his security briefings in bite-sized chunks and apparently Trump was editing an upcoming speech with Rob Porter scribbling his thoughts and neat clean penmanship the president wrote trade is bad and I do I do love this apparently the books last paragraph is in the man and his presidency Trump Boyer John's out had seen the tragic flaw on the political back-and-forth the evasions denials the tweeting the obscure and crying fake news the indignation Trump had one overriding problem that that Dowd knew but could not bring himself to say to the president you're an effing liar yeah I don't know what's the media is going crazy over all this stuff I don't know why I will be frank with you I do not understand why there is nothing there that is new if you didn't know all this stuff about President Trump before it's because you haven't been watching or because you're willfully ignorant President Trump does not know a lot about politics he just doesn't okay that's that's okay yeah being ignorant about things does that mean you're a bad president it really doesn't like the great lie about being the president of the United States did you have to be an expert on things you really do not have to be an expert on things Jimmy Carter was a very smart man and a really truly awful President of the United States we've had a lot of presidents who are very smart and garbage presidents Woodrow Wilson was the Dean of Princeton University and one of the worst presidents in American history and you don't have to be great at organization either to be a decent president you know many administration's fed chaos in their first couple of years Bill Clinton had chaos in his first couple of years none of this is a real shock but the media are going to seize on it and claim that this means that Trump is senile and he shouldn't be President none of it has any relevance none of it is a big deal there's only one way in which any of this is a big deal and that's the feeling of constant chaos emanating from the White House and it leads me to believe that Trump should basically fire half of the people who are in the executive branch right now just to prevent them from leaking so that there is some sort of semblance of normalcy at least emanating from from the halls of the White House so we'll talk a little bit more about that plus a bad poll for Republicans a few bad polls for congressional Republican

conservative podcast in the nation so the polls for the president have dropped in the last couple of weeks people trying to figure out exactly why he's down to about thirty nine point six percent in the average approval rating he's been very sticky in his approval ratings like his high is 42 he's down near his lows right now the Congressional generic ballot is really bad right now we're talking about like an eight to ten point gap for Republicans on average in the Real Clear Politics poll average people trying to figure out why there are three big polls that have recently come out that are bad for the president in which he's in the 30s an approval rating for the first time in a long time and the reason is because all of the good news about the economy all of the good news about the country have been obscured by the feeling of total chaos and this is where the media really do play a role and where the president playing into the teeth of the media is really not useful it's where if the president went silent and deprived them of oxygen he'd be much better off so today for example the president decides that would be wise to tweet out about all of the media members who are targeting him and he tweets out with regard to supposedly libel on the part of the media he tweeted out let's see here it is isn't a shame isn't it a shame he's replying Bob Woodward that someone can write an article or book totally make up stories and part of a picture of a person that is literally the exact opposite of the fact and get away with it without retribution or cost don't know why Washington politicians don't change libel laws I mean let's be honest here it'd be very bad thing for the President of the United States if they changed the libel laws Ted Cruz would sue him for suggesting that his dad shot JFK's there's that I mean this is the president who said the National Enquirer should win a Pulitzer Prize but with all of that said when the president is feeding the flames here it is not good it's not useful it gives a feeling that that things are in uproar when really they are not and Trump says almost everyone agrees that my administration has done more in less than two years than any other administration in the history of our country I'm tough as hell on paper and if I weren't nothing would get done also I questioned everybody and everything which is why I got elected so that's fine that's fine and then he said here's what he should be tweeting right the Trump economy is booming with the help of House and Senate GOP a farm bill with snap work requirements will bolster farmers and get America back to work passed the farm bill with snap work requirements now I'm gonna show why it is that people here it is finally the president science sounding off on Nike as well because that's what we needed he said just like the NFL whose rings have gone way down Nikes getting absolutely killed with anger and boycotts I wonder if that any idea it would be this way as far as the NFL is concerned I just find it hard to watch and always will until they stand for the flag this feeling of WWE incipient chaos everybody is going nuts over each other all the time I will show you why it is that president Trump's approval ratings have been lowered the only one of those four Suites that's actually important is the one where he is calling for work requirements added to the farm bill that is the only one of those four tweets that means anything we're not changing libel laws the NFL can do it at once Nike and kids do it at once they're both corporations they're both gonna feel the brunt of what they've done and president Trump suggesting that how he runs his administration tweeting crazily with weird punctuation that's not how pull either the only one of those four tweets that matters is the one reason ELISA jesting a policy fix when it comes to food stamps here are the number of retweets on each of those tweets on the one I'm liable fifteen thousand retweets thirty five thousand comments fifty-nine thousand likes I'm the one about how greatest administration is forty eight thousand likes thirteen thousand retweets seventeen thousand comments on the farm bill five thousand comments six thousand retweets twenty seven thousand likes it's about half of all the other stuff no one pays attention when the president talks policy everyone pays attention when he engages in the culture war kind of stick where a forty six thousand likes for the anti Nike tweet people are tired people are tired they really are and I think most Americans are just weary at this point and the president constantly feeding into the narrative is driving the weariness I'm not saying that he can't fight back I think that it's good that he fights back when lies are told I think that's fine but I do think that it is a mistake that the President of the United States is constantly engaging it's it's extraordinarily exhausting for the American people who mostly just want to go about their business I was talking to a friend of mine Dave Rubin yesterday he just took off 30 days to be off the grid he like put his cell phone in a safe he didn't look at the news for 30 days he came back looking happier than I've seen him in quite a while and the reason is because in those thirty days it has been 10 years of news he whirring for the American public most Americans don't want to be bothered with government in fact the conservative pitch is that when government doesn't bother to you your life is happy when one of the ways government bothers you is when it's in your face all the time and a 24/7 news cycle where the president is feeding the flames every day and the media love it let's not pretend the media don't love it they love it they're into it all that's doing is making people annoyed I think that's really what's happening here I think the poll numbers are dropping for Trump and the Republicans because people are just annoyed and I think they're also dropping because Republicans aren't talking about key issues they're not talking about the things that are important they're busy running after the headline of the day there's a poll from YouGov showing half of those under 35 say America is special compared to 80 percent of people 55 and over you want to know why that is because Republicans don't talk about why America is special anymore they just talk about whatever is the latest outrage of the day chasing the headlines does not win hearts and minds speaking to true eternal values that actually matters those are the things that win hearts and minds and bring people over we have an inordinately large young people audience on the show we do a huge audience most of our audience on the show is actually under the age of 40 that's unusual the reason is because we talk about we try to talk about these eternal values the things that actually matter and when you fill all the space with chatter all the time all you're doing is allowing the left to subsume those greater eternal values under a narrative of chaos that's where the president should really really cut it out now speaking of stupid stories of the day I got to tell you this story from the UK Sun and there's an amazing story transgender woman in tears after bank account frozen as she sounded like a man on the phone yeah this is his story from a national newspaper a transgender woman was left in tears after her bank account was frozen because she sounded like a man over the phone like a man is in quotation marks Sophia Rees 47 said she was humiliated and embarrassed after telephone banking staff said she failed security checks because she didn't quote speak like a lady things went from bad to worse the next day when she went to pay for items in Tesco and discovered that Santander had frozen her account now she is fighting to ensure that other transgender people are not treated in the same way Sofia a customer service adviser living in Nottingham went into her local Santander branch to confront staff after the humiliating telephone ordeal she said the embarrassment and humiliation I felt was unbelievable they said my voice did not match my profile because it sounded like a man on the phone and not a woman the whole situation is inadmissible I was crying my eyes out and I am not that type of person at all I'm a very courteous person I am outgoing but to feel that way when all I asked for was my money to be transferred I feel mistreated Sophia informed Santander last November should no longer be named Sergio on the account but despite changing her registered name and telling phone banking staff she was a transgender woman they still treated her with suspicion well right because um this is what customer service is trained to do there's literally an entire identity theft ad campaign by Citibank that is on television on national television in which you see two old ladies sitting there speaking with the voice of southern men because the idea is that southern men have stolen their credit card if I were a customer service representative and somebody called in and said Perry this is Sofia can you open up the money but really Sofia you sound like a dude because in fact it turns out that Sofia is a biological man so we all have to be crazy now in order to make room for the feelings of various other human beings it's just amazing stuff and the madness of left is not restricted to that sort of thing the left has gone so crazy that they're not just killing basic ideas of rationality they're also killing the far left they're killing basic ideas of comedy so this is my favorite piece of the day this is from vulture by a person named Jesse David Fox the title of the piece is how funny does comedy need to be it turns out the left is now realizing that all of their comics are no longer funny they are going for as we've called it on the show clap derp right now not a term that I coined but a term that we have used on the show clapped her they're not going for laughter they just want people to cheer for them so here is what vulture writes why so serious to quote a famous clown is a question being asked about comedy more and more frequently by its consumers and by comedians themselves to the point where some are questioning if it can even be called comedy Nanette is more a TED talk than a stand-up special was a common refrain this summer is drew Michael even a stand-up special was a question I was asked about the audience free HBO tour to take it to scripted TV I'm frequently reminded of a joke from difficult people when did comedies become 30-minute dramas comedians and comedy writers are increasingly pushing the bounds of what it means for something to be a comedy in the most basic sense rewiring the relationship between comedies and jokes so what is comedy without jokes it's post comedy so it's not that comedians are unfunny because they've decided to politically engage and be really crappy political pundits like I would be a bad comedian they are very bad political pundits I know because I'm a professional but they say that this is not post comedy I do love this I'm now going to use this excuse on everything if I'm bad at cleaning up the house I'm gonna say to my wife you know what I'm just post cleaning the house I'm post cleaning the house you know we've moved on to a different level it's um kind of meta you may have a tough time understanding this but cleaning the house doesn't actually have to be cleaning the house it can really be more the perception that the house ought to be clean and then I didn't really do the cleaning but I think there's meaning in thinking about but not cleaning the house it's called post cleaning the house I'm gonna do this with everything all right I'm not gonna be entertaining on be incredibly boring well hello post entertainment it won't because does entertainment really need to be entertaining or is it that is that just our subjective perception of what entertainment ought to be entertaining maybe what entertainment ought to be is just my general with Andre except three hours will be eight hours of Wallace Shawn talking some dude about weird random art will do that for like eight hours I'm great it'll be post entertainment you may know that they you know that a form of art is dead when they've declared the art post art comedy is dead because they have now declared it post comedy vulture writes sure it sounds pretentious it's a pretentious shift especially for a form that has always seemed allergic to pretension but it seems like the best way to describe comedy it's looking more like the frowning mass than the smiling one or alternatively these people are not remotely funny because they can't be funny anymore because they've killed the joke the left has killed every joke because everything is offensive now so instead they've decided to opt for a bunch of of of clapping clap applause generating lines that rip on president Trump just amazing stuff okay time for some things I like and then some things that I hate so things that I like today there's a good book called the boys in the boat by Daniel James Brown it has been made into a documentary by PBS it's about the Washington rowing team and and them essentially rowing for gold at the 1936 Berlin Olympics it's really entertaining if you like Seabiscuit the book which is much better than the movie by the way by Laura Hillenbrand this isn't quite as good as that book but it is definitely in painting read and a moving read it's it's pretty great like you don't have to like rowing or know anything about rolling to enjoy the book I don't know anything about rowing I enjoyed the book you can go check it out right now the boys in the boat nine Americans in their epic quest for gold it's a nice kind of reminder that America used to be kind of an awesome place America is still an awesome place but America at least used to be united by certain basic ideas of hard work and and motivation and getting ahead and now it seems like America's motivated mostly by us kicking each other in the ass which is which is really irritating okay time for a bunch of things that I hate so let's do a lot of hate today so Monica Lewinsky was appearing at in Israel and the interviewer asked her if she expected an apology from former President Bill Clinton and then she got up and walked off the stage so here's here's what that sounded like there recently an interview and then DC news president former president was rather apologized and he said I apologize oh I'm so sorry I'm not going to be able to do this okay so here's what I hate about this can we stop playing victim for just a second the only reason Monica Lewinski is famous is because she once got on her knees for the President of the United States that is legitimately the only reason that she is famous so I feel bad for Monica Lewinsky I feel like she was mistreated particularly by the press that claimed that she was something terrible and awful when in fact she was just a young intern who was being put in a bad position by a man in power but if we were going to pretend that Monica Lewinsky gets to act offended by people asking questions about the only thing that has ever been politically relevant about her career I can't go there with you I can't Monica Lewinsky is not a victim she's a victim of Bill Clinton but she's not a victim and she's victim the press she's not a victim of the lady asking her about whether Bill Clinton ought to apologize to her that's a ridiculous insane thing there's no reason for that at all and so it's it's just I find this sort of stuff where we all get to take offense at everything it's really dumb okay other things that I hate as I've been talking about all show long the left apocalyptic rhetoric with regard to everything happening in the country it is more likely to lead to the actual apocalypse when you think everything is the apocalypse this leads people to take up war stances on issues that really don't merit it Eugene Robinson is complicit in this today he's writing over at the Washington Post and he has a piece called what's at stake in November democracy democracy itself is at stake if you really believe that if you really believe the democracy itself is at stake that if Democrats don't win back Congress in 2018 democracy is over you're out of your damn mind you're out of your mind if they don't win in 2018 there's very high likelihood that they will win in 2020 I remember Republicans were saying the same before 2010 democracy was over we were all going to die can we quit with all of the it's the last election nonsense look if the left gets elected terrible things will happen in American politics things I don't like and then guess what there will be more elections because America is not on the brink of collapse as a nation we are on the brink of a lot of bad things we're on the brink of hating each other more than ever we're on the brink of a collapse of our of our social fabric but that is going to that is going to long predate the death of democracy the exaggeration in which we suggest that democracy is basically at the end of its rope if Trump is is you get some Republican Congress is just nonsense Eugene Robinson says Trump desperately wants an attorney general who will shut Mullen in come in Jeff Sessions cannot do so because he's recused from the matter Republican senators once warned from not to dare fire sessions now seem resigned to the fact Trump will do just that it makes sense for Trump to make his move after the election if Republicans still control Congress he'll get away with it if Democrats take charge he won't if anyone asks you what's at stake in November just tell them democracy and justice guess what if from fires Jeff Sessions and Republicans don't do anything and then the next Attorney General fires Robert Muller do you think Trump's gonna win reelection in 2020 you think there won't be any reaction to that how you think Democrats are gonna do in 2020 if Trump goes forward with that stuff you think it'll be good I highly doubt it but we're gonna get this sort of insane rhetoric anyway from the left Paul Krugman doing the same thing he says that again the Republican program on health care is get sick go bankrupt and die so if you disagree with him and his ridiculous plans on health care if you think that the ACA needs to be wildly dismembered because it is a bad bill if you think that there are better ways to solve for market oriented solutions in health care then perhaps what you really ought to do is is what you really mean according to Paul Krugman is that you want everybody to die this sort of apocalyptic rant then they wonder why you get Trump again Trump is a symptom the reason why people say things like why you got Trump is because people want to see Trump is a cause this is why this phrase really crops up like I'm a deep level everybody on the left doesn't like the phrase why you got Trump because it implies that Trump is a symptom rather than a cause of our Civic collapse Trump is a symptom he is not the cause Trump is just the capstone on a couple of decades worth of really bad politics probably at least four decades worth going back to the the excesses of the 1970s and 1960s in terms of the growth of government a lot of good things happen in the nineteen sixties on civil rights and women's rights not a lot of good things happen in any other area of American life in the 1960s the 1960s radicalized our politics in tremendously damaging ways for a variety of reasons the idea that Trump is the is the be-all end-all though is what the left is banked on and this is why they can't stand why you got Trump but this is why you got Trump it is that you use the same slurs against John McCain and Mitt Romney and George W Bush you used against Trump and then you got Trump congratulations this is how you got there okay time for a quick Federalist paper so we're all the way on Federalist 44 Wow been doing this for a while James Madison wrote this one and in it he discusses why states should not be able to for example print their own currencies he said just that this is going to lead to an inflation race States racking up debt and then being able to inflate their way out of it as opposed to States racking up debts and then having to tax their way out of it this is basically correct although I think there's a case to be made that separate currencies among the states might not be the world's worst thing because then we would actually get to see the fiscal effects of being fiscally irresponsible like we see in California as opposed to simply kicking the can down the road and assuming that the federal government is going to pick up the slack because the US dollar is going to support all of that spending Madison also writes about the Necessary and Proper Clause this is the the clause of the Constitution that says that the federal government has all powers Necessary and Proper to the fulfillment of its specific duties under the Constitution of the United States the case Madison makes is that the Necessary and Proper Clause is enough of a restriction on the federal government that really we shouldn't worry about the growth of the federal government and Madison would have been right if all of our constitutional officers had done their job instead the Necessary and Proper Clause was expanded to include all sorts of means that were not in fact Necessary and Proper here's what Madison wrote he said a few parts of the Constitution have been assailed with more intemperance than this yet on a fair investigation of it no part can appear more completely invulnerable without the substance of this power the whole Constitution be a dead letter those who is those who object to the article therefore as a part of the Constitution can only mean that the form of the provision is improper in the first instance the success of the usurpation meaning if the government takes power well depend on the executive and judiciary departments which try to expound and give effects of the legislative acts and in the last resort a remedy must be obtained from the people who can buy the election more faithful representatives and all the acts of the usurpers in the end it's gonna be up to the people to protect the Constitution and this is where we fail the American people have not protected the Constitution we can blame our politicians as much as we want the civic education in our country sucks we have not studied what the bounds of the government ought to be or why they ought to be there and thus we have delegated all sorts of power to the feds and then we whine about it after the feds use that power against us that's a mistake on our parts in the end it all comes down to what the American people want and I think it's the I think it's an HL Mencken kind of aphorism that the American people deserve a want they deserve it good and hard then that's sort of in the Madisonian view well it's time for the American people to wake up and maybe take some blame for the fact that our politics is failing finally Madison in Federalist forty-four discusses the supremacy clause he says that we have to have a federal government that is supreme to the state government otherwise the state governments are going to supreme be supreme over the federal government and the whole thing won't work this obviously is is fundamentally correct okay so we'll be back here tomorrow with all the latest updates from the Brett Kavanaugh hearings and everything else I'm Ben Shapiro this is the Ben Shapiro show the Ben Shapiro show is produced by
