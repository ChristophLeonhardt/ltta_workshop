>> Sandra: HOUSE GOP LAWMAKERS
WANT ANSWERS FROM ROD
ROSENSTEIN ABOUT HIS STATEMENTS
ABOUT WIRING THE PRESIDENT.
>> ROD DESERVES TO BE HEARD OUT.
I APPRECIATE THE PRESIDENT
TALKING TO HIM THIS WEEK AND
WE'RE GOING TO TALK TO HIM.
I WANT TO KNOW WHAT HE SAID AND
I WANT TO KNOW WHAT HE MEANT
AND WHETHER ANYONE ELSE WAS
PRESENT FOR THESE MEETINGS.
>> Sandra: CONGRESSMAN ANDY
BIGGS OF THE HOUSE JUDICIARY
COMMITTEE.
GOOD TO SEE YOU.
WHAT DO YOU WANT TO KNOW?
>> WELL, I WANT THE KNOW THE
SAME THING.
I'VE GIVEN MR. ROSENSTEIN ON
THIS PARTICULAR ISSUE A LITTLE
BREAK.
IT WAS THE TIMES THAT REPORTED
IT AND ANDREW MCCABE THAT WAS
SUPPOSEDLY WITH HIM.
WE NEED TO KNOW HOW SERIOUS
THIS WAS BECAUSE THIS POINTS TO
ACTUALLY TAKE OVER THE AMERICAN
GOVERNMENT.
IF HE MEANT IT AND THIS IS
SOMETHING HE WAS POISED TO DO,
THIS IS REALLY PROBLEMATIC.
>> Sandra: ROSENSTEIN HAS
DENIED IT.
>> HE HAS DENIED IT BUT IN WAYS
THAT ARE AMBIGUOUS AND HE HAS
SAID WELL, WE WERE JUST JOKING
AROUND.
OTHERS PRESENT REPORTEDLY HAVE
SAID NO, HE WAS DEAD SERIOUS
AND WHY WE WANT MR. ROSENSTEIN
TO COME IN SO WE CAN GET HIM TO
TELL US HIS SIDE OF THE STORY.
>> Sandra: WHAT DO YOU THINK
WILL COME FROM THE CLOSED-DOOR
MEETING?
>> I THINK YOU'LL SEE HOPEFULLY
WE'LL GET TO THE BOTTOM OF THAT
BUT WANT TO TALK ABOUT THE FISA
DOCUMENTS AND WHY WE AREN'T
GETTING THOSE RELEASED AND WHY
THE DOCUMENTS WE'VE BEEN
WANTING HAVE BEEN REDACTED SO
HEAVILY AND WHY HE HAS
STONEWALLED US ON THAT STUFF.
I THINK THIS WILL BE A LITTLE
MORE BROAD THAN JUST THE
ALLEGATIONS THAT HE WAS GOING
TO WIRETAP THE PRESIDENT.
>> Sandra: MARK MEADOWS, HE
TWEETED OUT THE HOUSE
LEADERSHIP HAD AGREED TO CALL
ROSENSTEIN FOR THE CLOSED-DOOR
MEETING TO EXPLAIN HIS ALLEGE
COMMENTS ON WIRING THE
PRESIDENT.
WE'LL SEE IF IT GETS EXPANDED
AND WHERE IT GOES.
WHAT DO YOU THINK SHOULD HAPPEN
WITH ROD ROSENSTEIN?
>> WELL, I THINK HE SHOULD
RESIGN.
I HAVE FELT THAT WAY FOR A
NUMBER OF MONTHS NOW BECAUSE
EVERYTHING FROM THE FOURTH
RENEWAL OF THE FISA WARRANT
THAT HE SIGNED ALL THE WAY TO
HIS LAX SUPERVISION OF THE
MUELLER INVESTIGATION.
THE DOCUMENTS THAT HE HASN'T
PROVIDED INDICATES A PATTERN.
THAT'S WHY THIS IS SO TROUBLING
BECAUSE IT FITS INTO THE
PATTERN OF HIM SUBVERTING
PRESIDENT TRUMP FROM THE WAY
THE TIME HE WAS A CANDIDATE TO
NOW.
>> Sandra: ONE HOUSE DEMOCRAT
JERRY NADLER OF NEW YORK SAYS
REPUBLICAN COLLEAGUES CAN'T BE
LEFT ALONE IN THE ROOM WITH
ROSENSTEIN.
THERE IS A POSSIBILITY, I
SUPPOSE, ALSO HE DOESN'T SHOW
UP FOR THIS.
IF HE DOES, THOUGH, JERRY
NADLER SAID THEY WILL NOT
REFERENCING REPUBLICANS, THEY
WILL NOT STOP UNTIL THEIR
ATTEMPT TO UNDERMINE MUELLER'S
INVESTIGATION IS COMPLETE.
WHAT DO YOU SAY BACK TO
DEMOCRATS WHO SAY IT IS AN
EFFORT TO UNDERMINE THE
INVESTIGATION.
>> IT IS NOT AN EFFORT TO
UNDERMINE THE INVESTIGATION.
WE ARE TRYING TO GET AT THE
TRUTH.
MAKE IT TRANSPARENT.
WHAT WE'VE FOUND OUT EVERYTHING
THAT HAS COME OUT OF THESE
INVESTIGATIONS IT WAS THE
DEMOCRATS, HILLARY CLINTON THAT
WERE TRYING TO WORK WITH THE
RUSSIANS TO DEFEAT A POLITICAL
OPPONENT WHICH IS OUTRAGEOUS.
THEY NEED TO CONFESS UP TO THAT
AND LET US GET TO THE BOTTOM OF
THIS.
WE WON'T GET TO THE BOTTOM OF
IT WITH THE D.O.J. AND F.B.I.
OBFUSCATING AT THE HIGHEST
LEVELS.
>> Sandra: DO YOU THINK HE
SHOWS UP FOR THIS MEETING?
>> I THINK SO.
HE HAS COME PUBLICLY AND
TESTIFIED BEFORE US AND HE WILL
PROBABLY COME AGAIN.
>> Sandra: IF HE DOESN'T DO YOU
AGREE WITH ISSUING A SUBPOENA
AS MEADOWS SUGGESTED?
>> I SHOULD SAY WE SHOULD ISSUE
