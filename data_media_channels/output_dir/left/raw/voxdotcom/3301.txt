00:00:00,580 --> 00:00:04,160
Here’s a theory: Game Thrones is really
all about climate change.

2
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:05,700
Climate change

3
00:00:05,700 --> 00:00:09,360
We are hurtling toward the day when climate
change could be irreversible.

4
00:00:09,370 --> 00:00:12,799
Why it’s so bad, and why it’s so hard
to do anything about it.

5
00:00:12,799 --> 00:00:16,760
Think about the White Walkers, those horrifying
monsters with the zombie army that killed

6
00:00:16,760 --> 00:00:21,160
everyone in that crazy battle at Hardhome.
They’re an inhuman destructive force that

7
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:24,830
literally changes the weather during their
onslaught.

8
00:00:24,830 --> 00:00:28,560
Like climate change, the White Walkers are
a threat to the whole human race. Noble houses

9
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:32,650
like the Starks, the Lannisters, the Baratheons,
the Martells, and the Boltons are too busy

10
00:00:32,650 --> 00:00:35,940
fighting with each other over control of the
kingdom to come together over a common

11
00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:39,400
threat. Sometimes, they even deny that White
Walkers are real.

12
00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:44,600
I don’t believe that giants and ghouls and
White Walkers are lurking beyond the Wall.

13
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:49,790
You’ve probably seen charts of CO2 emissions
skyrocketing in the 20th and 21st centuries

14
00:00:49,790 --> 00:00:55,480
as humans industrialized. And you’ve probably
also seen charts that show just how bad that’s

15
00:00:55,480 --> 00:00:57,050
going to be if we don’t stop it.

16
00:00:57,050 --> 00:01:05,080
Rising flood levels, droughts, ocean acidification.
Climate change is this massive global threat.

17
00:01:05,080 --> 00:01:09,370
But stopping it requires the world’s biggest
nations —like China, India, and the US — to sacrifice

18
00:01:09,370 --> 00:01:14,010
a little in the short term and put away their political competition with each other.

19
00:01:14,010 --> 00:01:18,460
In the meantime, the world’s poorest people
— the Wildlings in the show — suffer.

20
00:01:18,460 --> 00:01:23,130
And the experts in the real world, our own
Night’s Watch, stand on the sidelines.

21
00:01:23,130 --> 00:01:27,670
That’s why Charli Carpenter, a political
scientist at the University of Massachusetts,

22
00:01:27,670 --> 00:01:30,650
calls Game of Thrones a "collective action story"

23
00:01:30,650 --> 00:01:36,030
"The story of the Northern Wall and the forces it holds at bay," she says, "is about the mistaken belief

24
00:01:36,030 --> 00:01:39,740
that the industrial civilization can stand against the changing forces of nature."

25
00:01:39,750 --> 00:01:44,190
People love yelling at the characters on the
show for ignoring the zombie threat in the

26
00:01:44,190 --> 00:01:49,000
north. But if our zombies are climate change,
and we’re not doing nearly enough to prevent

27
00:01:49,000 --> 00:00:00,000
catastrophic global warming, who should you really be annoyed with?
