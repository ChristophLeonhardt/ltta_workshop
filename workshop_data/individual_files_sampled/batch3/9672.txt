SINCE IRAN WILL PROBABLY NEVER PAY UP. ALL RIGHT, AINSLEY, OVER TO YOU. AINSLEY: THANK YOU, STEVE. I'M TALKING TO HEROES AT 20320 FEET MOUNT DENALI IS THE TALLEST PEEK: MARINES AND THE AIR FORCE ARE GOING TO TRY TO ATTEMPT TO CLIMB TO THE TOM OF IT ALL TO HELP OTHER VETERANS, ESPECIALLY WOMEN. IF SUCCESSFUL, RETIRED MARINE CORPS SERGEANT KIRSTIE ENNIS WOULD BECOME THE FIRST FEMALE VETERAN AMPUTEE TO ACCOMPLISH THIS AMAZING FEAT. CAITLIN SHEEHAN AND RETIRED MARINE CORPS SERGEANT KIRSTIE ENNIS OF SERVICE TO SUMMIT JOIN US NOW. GOOD MORNING, LADIES. GOOD MORNING. AINSLEY: HOW DID YOU Y'ALL GET INVOLVED IN THIS AND DECIDE YOU ARE GOING TO CLIMB THIS MOUNTAIN IN THE MIDDLE OF THE SNOW? WELL, THE FELLOWS HAD DONE IT. AND THERE ARE A LOT OF INCREDIBLE PROGRAMS OUT THERE FOR VETERANS TO DO EXPEDITIONARY PROGRAMMING AND NONE OF THEM WERE FOCUSED ON WOMEN. IDENTIFYING THAT NEED, WE DECIDED THAT WE WERE GOING TO DO IT. AINSLEY: HOW DID Y'ALL MEET. THROUGH A MUTUAL FRIEND. YOU GUYS HAVE SIMILAR MIND SETS AND SIMILAR INTERESTS AND WE HAVE SAME COMMON GOAL OF WANTING TO PAY IT FORWARD AND HELP OTHER PEOPLE SO THEY LINKED US UP. AINSLEY: THAT'S GREAT. I MET YOU AT BUILDING HOPE FOR HEROES EVENT AND YOU LOST YOUR LEG FIGHTING FOR OUR COUNTRY IN A HELICOPTER CRASH IN AFGHANISTAN. TELL THE FOLKS AT HOME WHAT YOU WENT THROUGH. IT'S BEEN A LONG ROAD. I JOINED AT 17 YEARS OLD. AND AS YOU SAID, ON MY LAST DEPLOYMENT MY HELICOPTER WENT DOWN AND AS A RESULT OF IT I SUSTAINED SOME PRETTY SERIOUS INJURY EVERYTHING FROM TRAMMATIC BRAIN INJURY AND LOSING MY LEG. IT WAS UPHILL BATTLE. I LOST THAT SENSE OF PURPOSE AND I STRUGGLED EMOTIONALLY AND MENTALLY. I WAS UNFORTUNATE THAT THIS FAMILY I ESTABLISHED BUILDING HOMES FOR HERO WAS INTRODUCED INTO MY LIFE THAT PROVIDED THE FRAMEWORK AND FOUNDATION FOR MY FUTURE FOR ME DOING WHAT I'M DOING NOW. AINSLEY: THAT WAS A FEW YEARS AGO. AND MY GOSH HAVE YOU BEEN THROUGH SO MUCH. SO MANY SURGERIES. YOUR MOM WAS SITTING NEXT TO YOU. AND WE WERE ALL IN TEARS HEARING YOUR STORY. TELL ME WHAT THE ORGANIZATION HAS DONE FOR YOU. THIS ORGANIZATION REALLY I MEAN, IT GIVES PEOPLE THEIR LIVES BACK. WE DON'T WANT PITY. WE WANT OPPORTUNITY. THESE HOMES AND THIS ORGANIZATION PROVIDES. AINSLEY: MORTGAGE-FREE, RIGHT? ABSOLUTELY. MORTGAGE-FREE. AINSLEY: THEY OUTFITTED THIS HOME IN COLORADO FOR YOUR NEEDS TO MAKE SURE YOU WERE SAFE AND COMFORTABLE. ABSOLUTELY. HOMES TAILORED SPECIFICALLY TO THE VETERANS. 'S NOT JUST A HOME. IT'S NOT JUST FOUR WALLS. FOR SOMEBODY LIKE ME WHO DOESN'T HAVE A FAMILY OR SOME WELL-ESTABLISHED CAREER. THAT'S WHAT'S GOING TO PROVIDE ME AN OPPORTUNITY TO MOVE FORWARD. AINSLEY: CAITLIN, YOU ARE INVOLVED WITH THE ORGANIZATION AS WELL. TELL ME ABOUT YOUR SERVICE. YOU ARE IN THE AIR FORCE. I SPENT FOUR YEARS ACTIVE DUTY. DEPLOYED A COUPLE TIMES. MY FRIENDS CALLED ME THE CONFUSED HIPPY. BUT, I WAS REALLY HONORED TO HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO SERVE AND IT WAS A DYNAMIC EXPERIENCE THAT LEFT ME WITH SOME INJURIES AS WELL. SO HAVING THE OPPORTUNITY TO FIND THE WILDERNESS, SUCH AN INCREDIBLY HEALING PLACE. IT WAS IMPORTANT FOR ME TO CONTINUE TO MAKE THAT ACCESSIBLE TO OTHER VETERANS. AINSLEY: MOST PEOPLE COULDN'T DO THIS CLIMB WITHOUT INJURIES. BOTH OF HAVE YOU SUSTAINED INJURIES AND YOU ARE STILL GOING TO DO. THIS ARE YOU NERVOUS ABOUT IT? YEAH. NOT AS NERVOUS AS I AM TO BE ON TV. AINSLEY: REALLY? YEAH. IT'S ITS OWN SEPARATE KIND OF NERVES. IT'S INCREDIBLE BEING TIED UP WITH THIS GAL LITERALLY ON A MOUNTAINSIDE BECAUSE IT TAKES THREE KINDS OF STAMINA. ONE OF THEM IS MENTAL. WE GOT THAT WE HAVE BOTH BEEN TRIED AND WE BOTH HAVE DETERMINATION. AINSLEY: WHEN IS IT, AND HOW CAN WE HELP? WE STEP OFF ON JUNE 1st. THAT'S WHEN WE GET UP TO THE GLACIER AND MAKE OUR ASSENT. CHECK US OUT. AND BUILDING HOMES FOR HEROES.ORG. LOOKING TO GIFT A HOME TO THE VETERAN AND THEIR FAMILY COMPLETELY FREE ONCE EVERY 11 DAYS THIS YEAR. AND, YEAH. WE ARE JUST REALLY STOKED TO BE A PART OF THIS. AINSLEY: DOWN AT GROUND ZERO AND LOST SO MANY PEOPLE ON 9/11 AND SAID I WANT TO DO SOMETHING TO GIVE BACK TO THIS COUNTRY AND THE ORGANIZATION HAS TAKEN OFF. ONE HOME EVERY 11 DAYS? THAT'S INCREDIBLE. BUILDING HOMES FOR HEROES.
