1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:05,160
this is the scene in puerto rico's main
international airports it's nighttime

2
00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:11,190
and people are lined up hoping for the
possibility of getting a seat on a

3
00:00:11,190 --> 00:00:17,940
flight the next day off of this island
but the chances are slim because all day

4
00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:22,560
Tuesday only about ten commercial
flights were able to fly out of this

5
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:28,050
important airport in part the US
military says because a key radar

6
00:00:28,050 --> 00:00:33,090
installation was destroyed was damaged
by Hurricane Maria so all of these

7
00:00:33,090 --> 00:00:37,860
people here are waiting first-come
first-serve hoping that in the morning

8
00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:41,129
they can get a seat on the next
Southwest Airlines flight off of here

9
00:00:41,129 --> 00:00:48,090
and some people even traveling with very
cute Rottweiler puppies waiting for

10
00:00:48,090 --> 00:00:52,079
their chance to get out of here but this
is tough people are traveling with

11
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:57,840
children and they're people who've been
stranded here in Puerto Rico for days I

12
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:01,320
spoke earlier over here I want to come
over and say hi again

13
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:07,229
hey you introduce yourself please and
you're here with your grandson three

14
00:01:07,229 --> 00:01:12,570
years old hey they're chenille say hi
shiny

15
00:01:12,570 --> 00:01:17,460
do you think do you have any guarantee
of getting on tomorrow's flight no not

16
00:01:17,460 --> 00:01:23,070
really because versus the family and
family of the crew and then the people

17
00:01:23,070 --> 00:01:29,870
that have plane tickets so what has the
airline told you that to do so just

18
00:01:33,050 --> 00:01:43,140
coming up so you guys are gonna be
sleeping on the floor here tonight thank

19
00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:46,979
you good to meet you and then part of
the problem here is the people have

20
00:01:46,979 --> 00:01:50,070
already been living on the island for
the better part of a week with no

21
00:01:50,070 --> 00:01:55,530
electricity with almost no running water
as well the US military insists the

22
00:01:55,530 --> 00:01:58,290
flight capacity will improve in the days
ahead

23
00:01:58,290 --> 00:02:04,830
but for now this is the very difficult
situation again nearly a week after the

24
00:02:04,830 --> 00:00:00,000
hurricane Maria struck this island Ivan
