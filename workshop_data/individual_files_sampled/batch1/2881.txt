but get real people if you've downloaded something a game something that entertains you or or something that helps your life or makes your life easier and it's free there's something wrong didn't your parents ever tell you there's nothing free in life I promise you you're paying something and what you're paying is your privacy every one of them asked for permission to turn on the microphone take photographs read your contact list why depends on the day I have an Android and because it's a smartphone there is nothing that I can possibly do to prevent people from spying on me I don't use this for anything important I take the battery out when I don't want to be watched when I want to make a phone call that's that's the secret I use a dumb phone something that can't be tapped into by planning software with the iPhone you don't have what you have you have virtually no choice on what's happening how the phone comes loaded and you can't take the battery out so there's no way that you can ever assure yourself that it's not listening to you who the Android I can go in and I can configure things that I want we move what I want you know try to get you know ten minutes of privacy here and there not many I play frozen freefall from Disney it's it's a fun game now that's also spying on you but they're all they're doing is taking information so they can sell you things whether they can sell that information to someone else who can sell you things that's fine you want to use them for marketing purposes and try to sell me stuff go ahead
