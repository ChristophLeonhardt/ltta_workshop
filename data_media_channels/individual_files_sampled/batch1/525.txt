political opinion the single mom with lots of kids the alcoholic drinking away his Dolman the immigrant sponging off the state where the Channel Four's benefit street Channel Five's benefits written headlines in the Sun or the Daily Express when it comes to stories about welfare recipients the British media rely on a cast of cliche characters they recycle over and over those narratives and those kind of images create and sustain divisions with two deserving and undeserving populations so between co-workers and shuckers between welfare dependence and hard-working families the whole set up of these programs is around there being like a lemon or telling everybody in this studio and you're telling everybody who's watching right now that we're mugs that we're idiots we're fools for going out to work because why don't we all just give up work and live on benefits they present the idea of a benefits culture and a benefits lifestyle as if people and benefits are a choosing to be there and that language that derogatory language feeds into casual contempt for the poor of course Kelly's going to be comfortable in the benefits system because she's got all this money coming in what we see his programs like mickr Margaret we all pay your benefits which creates intentionally and very clearly a division between the idea of taxpayers and benefit recipients as enemies Britons have been fed stories about the flaws in their social benefit system for years the tabloids were the first to discover the audience's for such stories and by 2013 TV producers were tapping into that same mark the BBC's we all pay your benefits came first similar offerings followed on other channels along with millions of viewers the programmes attracted plenty of criticism for the exploitation of people's hardship what has come to be known as poverty poor the term poverty porn is a pretty accurate reflection on this idea of watching poor people for entertainment and reading about poor people newspapers when it's it's for entertainment as opposed to an actual insight into these people's lives I'd be quite offended if people thought that benefits Britain was poverty porn because benefits Britain told the stories of people who live their lives with limited resources there's no reason why you shouldn't tell their story if you're putting programs out about people whose lives and on benefits and who live in poverty and those programs rate well then program makers will just continue to make those programs and that's exactly it these programs rate well but did they actually portray reality take the benefits cheap trope in the 2015-16 tax year fraudulent benefits claims cost the British state 1.9 billion pounds the cost of tax evasion that year 5.2 billion pounds add into the mix tax avoidance at 1.7 billion and you're at almost four times the cost of benefit fraud and that doesn't begin to include wealthy Britons hiding their assets offshore or tax loss to the shadow economy but the media especially the tabloid press disproportionately choose to direct our attention and outrage to the former leaving high-income fraudsters who are less telegenic and harder to find in the shadows I would love to see you know the flip side of that and a television show about tax avoiders that people are elites in the system and dodging attacks and so forth the hypocrisy surrounded what they choose to put on TV screens it will always target the most vulnerable as a programme maker you always choose the best stories the characters who will make the best television in one case we filmed with some Romanian Roma's who had come to the UK to claim benefits often unfortunately then took British benefits back to Romania and build themselves a home I'm gonna take the benefit for an England yeah in like this one quickly money we shouldn't shy away from stories that are true stories just because they are sensational or the contributors are outrageous in some way because our lodging so long as the context is there then that should be fine really key areas of misrepresentation are around the day-to-day life of people in receipt of out of work benefits and how far that's kind of characterised by maybe idleness and inactivity and kind of active choosing to be on benefits people routinely are really trying very hard to get into paid work when and where that's like a realistic option the British welfare state the provision of education childcare health and homes came about after the Second World War designed to ensure a good standard of living from the cradle to the grave while popular at the outset by the late 1970s much of the rhetoric from politicians and the press was anti welfare Social Security was depicted as a burden on the state not a citizen's right the explosion of reality TV programs about benefits has only made this image worse some benefits claimants have been transformed by these programs into celebrities media stars and in mini industry has since grown around them take barry tomes a PR agent who saw an opportunity in the new genre and took it he has a book of clients who are on benefits and he says when journalists and TV producers need help with some kind of benefit story they call him his clients can be offered anywhere between 150 pounds to 25 thousand pounds for a story and barry takes a cut he also told us that misrepresentation is a big part of the game any story that looks like a benefit recipient is spending big money that's the key so just take one of our clients marine Buchan is a good example Marie Buchan hadn't been in the press for a while and she wanted a horse or some people are going to go nuclear about you having a horse will be saying you've got eight children why on earth would you want to have a horse that's going to cost you so much money what everybody comes to clues and that horse must cost thousands of pounds so actually the facts that were printed were nothing like the truth but I was happy to run with that because that's what we do I don't decide if it's fact or fiction that's for the publisher to decide there's an exclusive some might call it fate writers and this media myth-making has a potentially more detrimental impact on politics since the financial crisis ten years ago cuts to welfare have been a constant feature of government policy to sell those policies politicians often rely on the same kind of stereotypes that TV producers and newspaper publishers do what we've got is these programs that are setting themselves up as journalism giving Tory politicians more ammunition in order to put through brutal legislation if you don't have sanctions essentially you don't condition about a quarter ahead you don't change behavior tabloid headlines have led to debates in the House of Commons with for example George Osborne talking about how taxpayers are subsidizing these lifestyles and this was after the Daily Mail headline vile product of welfare UK it's setting an agenda that the problem is people who exist in poverty not that they are not an economic crisis or not austerity because of people like Murray that's why we do have to bring a benefits caffeine in a country where Social Security cuts are having a real impact on people in need a media industry has grown creating its own set of beneficiaries it is the publishers producers PR agents and politicians who reap the benefits you could call it irresponsible or to use a term the media usually reserved for those on benefits shameless
