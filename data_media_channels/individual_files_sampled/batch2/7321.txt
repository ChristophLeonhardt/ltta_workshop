TODAY THE SENATE PASSED A NEW SET OF SANCTIONS ON BOTH RUSSIA AND IRAN. LET'S TALK ABOUT SOME OF THESE NEW SANCTIONS ON RUSSIA. THIS IS FROM THE PRESS BRIEFING BY THE WAY. THESE ARE SIGNIFICANT NEW SETS OF SANCTIONS. WE ARE RUNNING LOW ON TIME, BUT WHAT IS INTERESTING ABOUT THIS BILL WHICH JUST PASSED IS NOT THE NEW SANCTIONS, BUT THE NEW OVERSIGHT THAT CONGRESS IS GOING TO HAVE OVER THE CONTINUANCE OF THE SANCTIONS. A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE CONCERNED ABOUT WHAT AFFECT SOME SORT OF DEAL INVOLVING THE EASING OF SANCTIONS MIGHT'VE HAPPENED DURING THE ELECTION. WE'VE ALREADY HEARD FROM DIPLOMATS IN THE STATE DEPARTMENT THAT THERE HAVE BEEN TIMES THEY HAVE TRIED TO PUT PRESSURE ON THE STATE DEPARTMENT TO INDEPENDENTLY CALL FOR THE SANCTIONS TO BE ERASED. CONGRESS IS SAYING THEY WANT TO BE A PART OF THAT. IF HE TRIES TO DO THAT IN THE FUTURE THEY WILL BE ABLE TO STOP IT THEORETICALLY. HER TO VETO A BILL THAT PASSED THE SENATE 97 TO 2. IN REFERENCE TO WHAT I WAS JUST SAYING ñ CHUCK SCHUMER DESCRIBING THIS NEW SET OF OVERSIGHT RULES SAYS THIS. AND SO ORIGINALLY THEY HAD A SET OF SANCTIONS ON IRAN THAT WAS GOING TO BE PUT INTO EFFECT. THERE WERE TWO VOTES AGAINST THAT. THEN YOU HAVE THE FINAL SET OF SANCTIONS ON BOTH RUSSIA AND IRAN, TWO PEOPLE VOTED AGAINST THAT. RAND PAUL VOTED AGAINST IT, THE OTHER ROW, BERNIE SANDERS. SO WHY WAS THAT? WE HAVE HIS STATEMENT, REMEMBER THIS IS SANCTIONS ON BOTH RUSSIA AND IRAN. HERE IS WHAT HE SAID. TOGETHER OR SEPARATE? TOGETHER IN ONE PACKAGE. BERNIE SANDERS SAID THIS. REFERRING TO THE NUCLEAR TRADE A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO. I BELIEVE THESE NEW SANCTIONS COULD ENDANGER THE AGREEMENT THAT WAS SIGNED BETWEEN THE US, ITS PARTNERS AND IRAN IN 2015. THAT IS NOT A RISK WORTH TAKING. HE APPARENTLY SUPPORTS THE RUSSIA SET OF SANCTIONS, BUT HE BELIEVES THAT PUTTING THESE NEW SANCTIONS ON IRAN COULD CAUSE THEM TO FEEL LIKE STAYING IN THAT TREE IS NOT WORTH IT ANYMORE. AND IF THEY WERE TO BACK OUT THEY COULD RESUME THEIR EFFORTS TO BUILD BALLISTIC MISSILE TECHNOLOGY AS WELL AS NUCLEAR WEAPONS. THIS WON'T PASS THE HOUSE. THERE IS NO WAY THAT DONALD TRUMP DOESN'T ARGUE THAT THIS UNDERMINES EXECUTIVE AUTHORITY. HE CAN PROBABLY GET THE SENATE TO VOTE ON THE IRAN PART SEPARATELY IF HE NEEDED TO. BUT DEMOCRATS WILL TRY AND PUT THEM TOGETHER OBVIOUSLY. THE WHOLE WAY YOU WIN THIS BATTLE IS POLITICALLY. BUT NOW THERE IS A 97 TO 2 VOTE ON RECORD. WHICH YOU PROBABLY WON'T SEE ANOTHER. I DON'T KNOW ñ INDICATION HAS COME OUT FROM A SPOKESPERSON FOR PAUL RYAN SAYING THAT HE WAS A VOCAL PROPONENT FOR THE LAST GROUP OF SANCTIONS, BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN THAT HE COULD NOT DO WHAT YOU ARE ALLUDING TO. THAT HAS TO PASS THE HOUSE. INTERESTINGLY TODAY JOHN KERRY PUT OUT A STATEMENT ECHOING MUCH OF WHAT BERNIE SANDERS SAID ABOUT THE IRAN PORTION. SAYING THIS WOULD RISK IRAN PULLING OUT OF THAT TREATY WHICH IS DANGEROUS FOR A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT REASONS. THAT IS ONE THING TO CONSIDER. WE ARE STILL EARLY IN THE PROCESS, WE WANTED TO GET YOU UPDATED.
