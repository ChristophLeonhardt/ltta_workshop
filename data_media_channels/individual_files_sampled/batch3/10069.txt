York's largest police union suing its own commissioner and the city's administration - over the release of body cam footage this footage has serious implications not something for the safety and due process rights of police officers but for the privacy and rights of members of the public as well okay let's look at the story here the union claims the release of video from officers body cameras is basically a breach of citizens privacy adding that the administration uses quote arbitrary inconsistent parameters and is guided by again quote political considerations one case in points an incident last September when a man was shot after pointing a toy gun at police that video was released despite fears it could jeopardize an ongoing investigation former officer who blew the whistle on police activities believes the current system allows videos to be used for political gain I don't think it's an all of a sudden decision if you actually read the lawsuit in the very first paragraph it states clearly what it wants and all it's asking for and the gist of the complaint is for these body camera videos not to be used selectively for political gain that's that's all that it's asking for it's asking for a better system for these to be disseminated out onto the public and as of right now the two people that the complaint is listing against for seemingly abusing the authority is for mayor de Blasio and the police commissioner itself so the complaint says that it wants just not selective you videos being removed last year three body cam videos were released by the New York Police Department two of them showed officers shooting and killing suspects in fact a local news channel paid thirty six thousand dollars to show additional footage now the Union says the videos are selected to make a point and that the incidents could even be weeks or years apart all you may find some of the upcoming images distressing here next good on your stomach you're seeing police officers being pawns in political games there get political games and they need to be protected there in the middle buffer between the laws the law makers the people who they're supposed to patrol and police the laws over and then their body camera usage their their squad car video footage is all being used either for them or against them as a as a pawn moving game and it's just not fair
