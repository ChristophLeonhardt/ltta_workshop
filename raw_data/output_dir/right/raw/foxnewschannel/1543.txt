1
00:00:01,955 --> 00:00:03,389
IT WASN'T ANOTHER

2
00:00:03,389 --> 00:00:03,856
ADMINISTRATION.

3
00:00:03,856 --> 00:00:04,624
IT WAS THIS ADMINISTRATION THAT

4
00:00:04,624 --> 00:00:04,991
CLOSED IT.

5
00:00:04,991 --> 00:00:09,762
>> MY NEXT GUEST SENATOR MARCO

6
00:00:09,762 --> 00:00:11,164
RUBIO HARSHLY WENT AFTER THE

7
00:00:11,164 --> 00:00:12,265
PRESIDENT, SAYING ON TWITTER, IF

8
00:00:12,265 --> 00:00:14,767
THIS IS TRUE THEN ADMINISTRATION

9
00:00:14,767 --> 00:00:17,670
HAS SURRENDERED TO CHINA ON ZTE,

10
00:00:17,670 --> 00:00:19,372
MAKING CHANGES TO THEIR BOARD,

11
00:00:19,372 --> 00:00:26,512
AND A FINE WON'T STOP THEM FROM

12
00:00:26,512 --> 00:00:27,981
STEALING FROM UNITED STATES, BUT

13
00:00:27,981 --> 00:00:29,649
THIS IS TOO IMPORTANT TO BE

14
00:00:29,649 --> 00:00:29,949
OVER.

15
00:00:29,949 --> 00:00:33,886
WE WILL BEGIN WORKING ON

16
00:00:33,886 --> 00:00:36,155
VETO-PROOF CONGRESSIONAL ACTION.

17
00:00:36,155 --> 00:00:38,291
>> I JUST HEARD THE PRESIDENT

18
00:00:38,291 --> 00:00:38,658
SPEAKING.

19
00:00:38,658 --> 00:00:39,926
IF THAT'S THE DIRECTION WE'RE

20
00:00:39,926 --> 00:00:41,127
GOING, THAT'S GOOD NEWS.

21
00:00:41,127 --> 00:00:43,229
I'M GOING OFF THE NEWS REPORTS

22
00:00:43,229 --> 00:00:48,134
SAYING SOME IN HIS COMINGS

23
00:00:48,134 --> 00:00:49,836
ADMINISTRATION ARE PUSHING FOR A

24
00:00:49,836 --> 00:00:50,303
BIG DEAL.

25
00:00:50,303 --> 00:00:51,771
IT SHOULDN'T BE MIXED.

26
00:00:51,771 --> 00:00:54,207
WE HAVE A HUGE PROBLEM WITH

27
00:00:54,207 --> 00:00:54,507
CHINA.

28
00:00:54,507 --> 00:00:57,810
THEY FORCE OUR COMPANIES TO TURN

29
00:00:57,810 --> 00:00:59,445
OVER INTELLECTUAL PROPERTIES,

30
00:00:59,445 --> 00:00:59,779
SECRETS.

31
00:00:59,779 --> 00:01:01,814
YOU CAN'T DO BUSINESS IN CHINA

32
00:01:01,814 --> 00:01:03,049
UNLESS YOU DO THAT.

33
00:01:03,049 --> 00:01:04,751
MEANWHILE THEIR COMPANIES CAN DO

34
00:01:04,751 --> 00:01:05,652
WHATEVER THEY WANT HERE.

35
00:01:05,652 --> 00:01:07,353
THAT HAS TO BE FIXED, BECAUSE

36
00:01:07,353 --> 00:01:10,757
IT'S LONG TERM AND PROBLEMATIC.

37
00:01:10,757 --> 00:01:11,691
ZTE IS A CELLPHONE AND

38
00:01:11,691 --> 00:01:13,693
TECHNOLOGY COMPANY.

39
00:01:13,693 --> 00:01:15,194
THEY GOT CAUGHT INVOLVING THE

40
00:01:15,194 --> 00:01:16,896
IRAN DEAL, THE SANCTION IN NORTH

41
00:01:16,896 --> 00:01:17,196
KOREA.

42
00:01:17,196 --> 00:01:18,131
THEY GOT HIT WITH A BILLION

43
00:01:18,131 --> 00:01:19,866
DOLLAR FINE, AND WERE TOLD THEY

44
00:01:19,866 --> 00:01:21,668
HAD TO FIRE THE EMPLOYEES WHO

45
00:01:21,668 --> 00:01:22,035
DID THAT.

46
00:01:22,035 --> 00:01:24,671
YOU KNOW WHAT THEY DID?

47
00:01:24,671 --> 00:01:25,071
THEY LIED.

48
00:01:25,071 --> 00:01:26,472
THEY DIDN'T FIRE THE EMPLOYEES.

49
00:01:26,472 --> 00:01:27,774
THEY GAVE THEM A BONUS, AND

50
00:01:27,774 --> 00:01:29,809
TRIED TO COVER THAT UP AS WELL,

51
00:01:29,809 --> 00:01:31,544
LIKE THEY TRIED TO COVER UP THE

52
00:01:31,544 --> 00:01:32,145
VIOLATIONS.

53
00:01:32,145 --> 00:01:34,847
FINE, YOU CAN'T BUY OUR

54
00:01:34,847 --> 00:01:35,815
SEMICONDUCTORS, AND THAT PUT

55
00:01:35,815 --> 00:01:36,883
THEM OUT OF BUSINESS.

56
00:01:36,883 --> 00:01:39,452
THAT'S WHAT WEE NEED TO BE DOING

57
00:01:39,452 --> 00:01:41,954
WHEN THEY VIOLATE THESE THINGS.

58
00:01:41,954 --> 00:01:44,991
OTHERS SAY LET'S FINE THEM

59
00:01:44,991 --> 00:01:47,460
AGAIN, FIRE THE BOARD OF

60
00:01:47,460 --> 00:01:47,827
DIRECTORS.

61
00:01:47,827 --> 00:01:49,128
THEY'VE ALREADY DONE THAT ONCE.

62
00:01:49,128 --> 00:01:50,630
YOU USE THOSE PHONES, THEY CAN

63
00:01:50,630 --> 00:01:53,266
STEAL OUR SECRETS, SPY ON US.

64
00:01:53,266 --> 00:01:58,137
THEY EVEN HAVE SUBCONTRACTORS IN

65
00:01:58,137 --> 00:02:02,008
ZTE -- PEOPLE COULD BE USING

66
00:02:02,008 --> 00:02:05,712
HUAWEI TECHNOLOGY OR SOMETHING

67
00:02:05,712 --> 00:02:07,013
AND NOT KNOW IT.

68
00:02:07,013 --> 00:02:11,417
>> IN YOUR MIND, IS THERE NO

69
00:02:11,417 --> 00:02:14,554
NEGOTIATION TO ALLOW ZTE TO

70
00:02:14,554 --> 00:02:14,921
SURVIVE?

71
00:02:14,921 --> 00:02:16,089
THEY TOLD THE TRUMP

72
00:02:16,089 --> 00:02:17,156
ADMINISTRATION THEY'RE GOING TO

73
00:02:17,156 --> 00:02:17,690
GO BANKRUPT.

74
00:02:17,690 --> 00:02:18,725
THEY'RE GOING TO GO OUT OF

75
00:02:18,725 --> 00:02:19,826
BUSINESS AND WE NEED TO FIGURE

76
00:02:19,826 --> 00:02:20,927
THIS OUT.

77
00:02:20,927 --> 00:02:22,895
IS THERE ANY WAY YOU'D BE

78
00:02:22,895 --> 00:02:24,630
COMFORTABLE DEALING WITH ZTE

79
00:02:24,630 --> 00:02:24,931
EVER?

80
00:02:24,931 --> 00:02:26,132
>> FIRST OF ALL, WHAT ABOUT THE

81
00:02:26,132 --> 00:02:28,267
AMERICAN COMPANIES LIKE THE

82
00:02:28,267 --> 00:02:29,168
CHINESE HAVE BANKRUPTED, LIKE

83
00:02:29,168 --> 00:02:29,869
THE AMERICAN COMPANIES THAT

84
00:02:29,869 --> 00:02:31,237
PARTNER WITH THE CHINESE

85
00:02:31,237 --> 00:02:31,604
COMPANIES.

86
00:02:31,604 --> 00:02:33,039
THE CHINESE STEAL EVERYTHING YOU

87
00:02:33,039 --> 00:02:33,306
DO.

88
00:02:33,306 --> 00:02:35,475
ONCE THEY FIGURE OUT HOW TO DO,

89
00:02:35,475 --> 00:02:36,876
WE DON'T NEED YOU ANYMORE, WE'LL

90
00:02:36,876 --> 00:02:38,778
DO IT CHEAPER, BECAUSE OUR

91
00:02:38,778 --> 00:02:40,246
GOVERNMENT SUBSIDIZES US, AND

92
00:02:40,246 --> 00:02:41,247
YOU'RE OUT OF BUSINESS.

93
00:02:41,247 --> 00:02:42,882
NUMBER TWO, WE DIDN'T PUT THEM

94
00:02:42,882 --> 00:02:44,717
OUT OF BUSINESS, WE JUST SAID

95
00:02:44,717 --> 00:02:46,753
WE'RE NOT GOING TO SELL THEM

96
00:02:46,753 --> 00:02:52,291
AMERICAN SEMI CONDUCT

97
00:02:52,291 --> 00:02:52,325
AMERICAN SEMICCONDUCT

98
00:02:52,325 --> 00:02:52,358
AMERICAN SEMICONNDUCT

99
00:02:52,358 --> 00:02:52,392
AMERICAN SEMICONDUUCT

100
00:02:52,392 --> 00:02:52,425
AMERICAN SEMICONDUCTT

101
00:02:52,425 --> 00:02:52,692
AMERICAN SEMICONDUCTORS.

102
00:02:52,692 --> 00:02:53,459
I DON'T FEEL ABOUT THAT.

103
00:02:53,459 --> 00:02:55,161
I DON'T WORK FOR THE CHINESE

104
00:02:55,161 --> 00:02:55,561
GOVERNMENT.

105
00:02:55,561 --> 00:02:57,096
>> I UNDERSTAND, BUT YOU LOOK AT

106
00:02:57,096 --> 00:02:58,664
IT THE WAY YOU LOOK AT IT, WHICH

107
00:02:58,664 --> 00:03:00,500
I COMPLETELY UNDERSTAND, THE WAY

108
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:02,068
WE'VE DONE THIS FOR A LONG TIME.

109
00:03:02,068 --> 00:03:03,202
THE PRESIDENT IS LINKING A LOT

110
00:03:03,202 --> 00:03:04,637
OF THINGS THAT MANY PEOPLE ARE

111
00:03:04,637 --> 00:03:05,905
NOT COMFORTABLE WITH HAVING

112
00:03:05,905 --> 00:03:06,239
LINKED.

113
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:06,739
>> RIGHT.

114
00:03:06,739 --> 00:03:08,441
>> THIS IS DEFINITELY THE WAY

115
00:03:08,441 --> 00:03:10,877
THAT THE TRUMP FOREIGN POLICY

116
00:03:10,877 --> 00:03:12,278
DOCTRINE, IF YOU WILL, IS

117
00:03:12,278 --> 00:03:12,645
EMERGING.

118
00:03:12,645 --> 00:03:14,714
HE'S SAYING, LOOK, I WANT THEM

119
00:03:14,714 --> 00:03:15,715
TO HELP US WITH NORTH KOREA.

120
00:03:15,715 --> 00:03:16,816
I WANT TO LOWER THE TRADE

121
00:03:16,816 --> 00:03:18,351
DEFICIT WITH THE CHINESE.

122
00:03:18,351 --> 00:03:20,420
I WANT TO FIGURE OUT A WAY TO DO

123
00:03:20,420 --> 00:03:20,686
IT.

124
00:03:20,686 --> 00:03:21,954
THEY SAID TO THE ADMINISTRATION,

125
00:03:21,954 --> 00:03:24,056
IN SOME FORM OR ANOTHER, LOOK,

126
00:03:24,056 --> 00:03:26,659
GIVE US SLACK ON ZTE, AND THEN

127
00:03:26,659 --> 00:03:28,694
WE'RE GOING TO BUY A LOT MORE

128
00:03:28,694 --> 00:03:30,096
AMERICAN GOODS AND HELP YOU WITH

129
00:03:30,096 --> 00:03:30,763
THE NORTH KOREA SITUATION.

130
00:03:30,763 --> 00:03:31,197
>> YEAH.

131
00:03:31,197 --> 00:03:32,799
YOU SAID SOMETHING I DISAGREE

132
00:03:32,799 --> 00:03:33,099
WITH.

133
00:03:33,099 --> 00:03:34,700
THIS IS NOT THE WAY WE'VE ALWAYS

134
00:03:34,700 --> 00:03:35,768
DONE IT.

135
00:03:35,768 --> 00:03:37,303
THE WAY WE'VE ALWAYS DONE IT THE

136
00:03:37,303 --> 00:03:38,337
WAY THEY'RE GOING NOW.

137
00:03:38,337 --> 00:03:39,939
THAT IS THE CHINESE GO TO A

138
00:03:39,939 --> 00:03:41,574
BUNCH OF AMERICAN COMPANIES, A

139
00:03:41,574 --> 00:03:45,611
SEMI CONDUCTOR COOR

140
00:03:45,611 --> 00:03:45,645
SEMI CONDUCTOR COMR

141
00:03:45,645 --> 00:03:46,145
SEMI CONDUCTOR COMPANY AND SAY

142
00:03:46,145 --> 00:03:47,780
CAN YOU GO TO CONGRESS AND LOBBY

143
00:03:47,780 --> 00:03:50,249
THEM TO CHANGE THEIR MINDS?

144
00:03:50,249 --> 00:03:52,285
THEN THEY BACK OFF.

145
00:03:52,285 --> 00:03:54,587
THAT'S WHY THEY'VE GAINED AN

146
00:03:54,587 --> 00:03:56,422
ADVANTAGE US.

147
00:03:56,422 --> 00:03:58,691
NORTH KOREA IS IN CHINA'S

148
00:03:58,691 --> 00:03:59,058
INTERESTS.

149
00:03:59,058 --> 00:03:59,759
IF NORTH KOREA AND KIM JONG-UN

150
00:03:59,759 --> 00:04:01,394
GOES DOWN, A BUNCH OF NORTH

151
00:04:01,394 --> 00:04:03,129
KOREANS WILL COME ACROSS THE

152
00:04:03,129 --> 00:04:03,463
BORDER.

153
00:04:03,463 --> 00:04:05,498
THEY'RE NOT DOING US ANY FAVOR

154
00:04:05,498 --> 00:04:06,699
HELPING US WITH NORTH KOREA.

155
00:04:06,699 --> 00:04:07,834
THEY'RE CLOSER TO THAT CRAZY GUY

156
00:04:07,834 --> 00:04:08,434
THAN WE ARE.

157
00:04:08,434 --> 00:04:10,102
THEY SHOULD BE WORRIED ABOUT IT.

158
00:04:10,102 --> 00:04:11,270
NUMBER THREE, WHAT KIND OF DEAL

159
00:04:11,270 --> 00:04:15,441
IS IT WHERE THEY SAY WE'LL BUY

160
00:04:15,441 --> 00:04:17,142
MORE AGRICULTURE FROM AMERICA,

161
00:04:17,142 --> 00:04:18,310
AND IN RETURN WE'RE GOING TO

162
00:04:18,310 --> 00:04:19,278
KEEP STEALING YOUR STUFF.

163
00:04:19,278 --> 00:04:21,247
IN ABOUT FIVE OR EIGHT YEARS,

164
00:04:21,247 --> 00:04:23,249
THEY'LL DOMINATE BIOTECH,

165
00:04:23,249 --> 00:04:24,851
AEROSPACE, BE ABLE TO LISTEN IN

166
00:04:24,851 --> 00:04:26,719
TO OUR MILITARY SECRETS, USE

167
00:04:26,719 --> 00:04:27,019
THOSE.

168
00:04:27,019 --> 00:04:28,921
I MEAN, THEY ARE BUILDING

169
00:04:28,921 --> 00:04:29,789
AIRPLANES -- OUR AIRPLANES THAT

170
00:04:29,789 --> 00:04:31,190
TOOK US 20 YEARS TO INNOVATE,

171
00:04:31,190 --> 00:04:32,692
THESE GUYS ARE COMING UP WITH

172
00:04:32,692 --> 00:04:34,694
THESE THINGS IN TWO YEARS.

173
00:04:34,694 --> 00:04:36,729
THEY'RE EITHER THAT BRILLIANT,

174
00:04:36,729 --> 00:04:38,965
WHICH THEY'RE NOT, OR THEY'RE

175
00:04:38,965 --> 00:04:40,600
STEALING IT FROM US.

176
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:42,768
>> HERE'S MY QUESTION FOR YOU.

177
00:04:42,768 --> 00:04:44,904
IS CHINA JUST AN ENEMY?

178
00:04:44,904 --> 00:04:45,872
IS THERE ANYTHING WE CAN DEAL

179
00:04:45,872 --> 00:04:46,772
WITH THEM ON?

180
00:04:46,772 --> 00:04:48,274
WHEN YOU LOOK AT WHAT'S

181
00:04:48,274 --> 00:04:50,109
HAPPENING ON DISPUTED ISLAND,

182
00:04:50,109 --> 00:04:51,110
THEIR ECONOMIC GROWTH, THEIR

183
00:04:51,110 --> 00:04:53,513
GROWTH RATE, THEY WANT TO

184
00:04:53,513 --> 00:04:54,580
SURPASS US BY 2028.

185
00:04:54,580 --> 00:04:56,048
>> RIGHT.

186
00:04:56,048 --> 00:04:58,117
>> ARE THERE DEALS THAT COULD BE

187
00:04:58,117 --> 00:04:59,552
DONE OR SHOULD WE TREAT THEM IN

188
00:04:59,552 --> 00:05:01,220
A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT WAY AND

189
00:05:01,220 --> 00:05:03,189
SAY OBVIOUSLY YOU GUYS ARE OUT

190
00:05:03,189 --> 00:05:04,957
FOR YOURSELVES, WE'RE OUT FOR

191
00:05:04,957 --> 00:05:07,760
OURSELVES, AND THAT'S IT?

192
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:08,995
>> RIGHT NOW THERE'S AN

193
00:05:08,995 --> 00:05:09,362
IMBALANCE.

194
00:05:09,362 --> 00:05:11,464
WHEN YOU HAVE AN IMBALANCE, THE

195
00:05:11,464 --> 00:05:14,834
OTHER PLACE WILL TAKE ADVANTAGE

196
00:05:14,834 --> 00:05:16,302
OF YOU.

197
00:05:16,302 --> 00:05:18,404
YOU HAVE WARS OVER IMAMBULANCE.

198
00:05:18,404 --> 00:05:20,339
CHINESE COMPANIES CAN DO

199
00:05:20,339 --> 00:05:22,542
WHATEVER.

200
00:05:22,542 --> 00:05:24,176
AMERICAN COMPANIES AROUND

201
00:05:24,176 --> 00:05:26,879
ALLOWED INTO CHINA, AND IF THEY

202
00:05:26,879 --> 00:05:29,015
ARE IT'S BECAUSE THEY'VE

203
00:05:29,015 --> 00:05:30,016
PARTNERED WITH CHINESE

204
00:05:30,016 --> 00:05:31,050
COMPANIES, AND THEN THEY STEAL

205
00:05:31,050 --> 00:05:32,785
FROM YOU.

206
00:05:32,785 --> 00:05:33,886
FOR 20 YEARS, AMERICAN

207
00:05:33,886 --> 00:05:34,820
PRESIDENTS, BEFORE THIS ONE,

208
00:05:34,820 --> 00:05:36,789
MADE THE DECISION, DON'T WORRY

209
00:05:36,789 --> 00:05:38,324
ABOUT IT, ONCE THEY'RE RICH,

210
00:05:38,324 --> 00:05:40,226
THEY'RE GOING TO ACT MORE LIKE

211
00:05:40,226 --> 00:05:40,493
US.

212
00:05:40,493 --> 00:05:42,161
IT DIDN'T WORK OUT THAT WAY.

213
00:05:42,161 --> 00:05:49,435
NOW THEY'VE FINALLY REALIZED,

214
00:05:49,435 --> 00:05:50,836
AND IT'S ALMOST TOO LATE.

215
00:05:50,836 --> 00:05:53,506
WE'RE TURNING THEM INTO AN

216
00:05:53,506 --> 00:05:56,642
ENEMY, BY THIS IMBALANCE.

217
00:05:56,642 --> 00:05:57,543
UNTIL WE GET THIS THING BALANCED

218
00:05:57,543 --> 00:00:00,000
