ACTIONS. WE START WITH YOU TONIGHT, BUSY EVENING. SO MANY INTERESTING MOMENTS IN THAT INTERVIEW THAT YOU JUST DID WITH JAMES COMEY. WHAT STANDS OUT TO YOU? Bret: FIRST, THAT HE ACTUALLY SHOWED UP HERE AT THE GETTING UPDATES, SO WE SHIFTED THINGS AROUND. WHAT STOOD OUT TO ME WAS ONE, THAT HE SAID TO THIS DAY HE DOESN'T DEFINITIVELY KNOW THAT THE DOSSIER WAS FUNDED BY THE DNC AND HILLARY CLINTON. I FIND THAT FASCINATING, I FIND IT INTERESTING. I THINK AS YOU ARE PRESENTING THE DOSSIER AS A REASON TO SURVEY ALL CARTER PAGE TO A FISA COURT, WHY DON'T YOU KNOW? IT'S UNVERIFIED AND SALACIOUS, BUT IT'S FUNDED BY YOUR OPPONENT. I DON'T KNOW THE ANSWER TO THAT. I THOUGHT THAT'S WHAT REALLY STRUCK OUT. Martha: I AGREE. IT WAS LIKE A DEER IN HEADLIGHTS LOOK. I HAVE NO IDEA, WE SHOULD LOOK INTO THAT. THIS IS THE HEAD OF THE INVESTIGATIVE BUREAU OF THE UNITED STATES. THE USE OF QUESTIONS THAT ANYBODY WOULD WANT TO KNOW, SO YOU HAVE THIS DOCUMENT. WHERE DOES IT COME FROM, WHO GENERATED IT? HE BASICALLY SAID I WAS TOLD IT WAS A LEGITIMATE SOURCE AND THAT WAS ENOUGH FOR HIM. THE FBI DECIDED NOT TO BRING HIM ON, SO THEY MUST'VE KNOWN SOMETHING WAS UP WITH HIS CREDIBILITY. HE GOT FIRED BY THE FBI FOR LEAKING TO THE MEDIA. THE OTHER THING THAT STUCK OUT TO ME WAS ABOUT THE LEAKING OF THE MEMOS. AGAIN, HE PUSHED BACK ON THE WORD LEAKED. I TRIED TO GET FBI PROTOCOL AND THE DEPLOYMENT THAT HE'S DONE ABOUT WHAT A LEAK IS. ED WAS WORD PRODUCT. HE SAID HE GAVE IT TO A GOOD FRIEND, BUT IT TURNS OUT HE WAS ALSO WORKING AT THE FBI. WHY DOES THAT MATTER? WHAT WAS HIS JOB? HE WAS A GUY THAT YOU GAVE STUFF TOO? HE ALSO CONFIRMED THAT THE MEMOS WHICH WERE NOW CONSIDERED CLASSIFIED MEMOS WENT TO THREE OTHER PEOPLE. WE KNOW THAT THE FBI HAD TO SCRUB THE COMPUTER OF ONE OF THOSE PEOPLE AFTER THAT BECAUSE OF INTELLIGENCE. WHERE THIS GOES, I DON'T KNOW. Martha: IT WILL BE FASCINATING TO SEE WHAT THE IG FINDS BECAUSE THAT IS A MAJOR FORM OF CONTENTION RIGHT NOW. HE WAS MUCH ROUGHER ON HIM THAN JUST THAT AND JAMES COMEY SAID ABSOLUTELY NOT. THOSE ARE MY PRIVATE MEMORIES. IT WAS A DIARY THAT I WAS PUTTING TOGETHER AND IT WAS MY LIFE AS A PRIVATE CITIZEN, BUT THEY WERE GENERATED ON THE FBI'S PAYROLL AND COMPUTERS. I WONDER, WHICH ONE OF THOSE IS ACTUALLY THE CASE IN THE MINDS OF THE IG? WE DON'T KNOW, BUT WHAT WE DO KNOW IS IT'S GOING TO BE COMING OUT SOON ACCORDING TO LAWMAKERS ON THE HILL, THEY THINK IT'S GOING TO BE EXPLOSIVE BECAUSE THEY BEEN WORKING ON IT FOR A LONG TIME. THE OTHER THINGS THAT STRUCK ME ABOUT THE INTERVIEW IS WHAT HE SAID AT THE END, THAT HE WAS STILL THE FBI DIRECTOR TONIGHT. LISTENING TO THIS MEDIA ROLLOUT IN THIS BOOK, WHICH HAS DONE VERY WELL, HE HAS NOT SHIED AWAY FROM SAYING THE PRESIDENT IS MORALLY UNFIT, THAT PEOPLE SHOULD VOTE THEIR CONSCIOUS, BUT NOT VOTE FOR THIS GUY. YET, HE SAID AS OF TONIGHT, HAD HE NOT BEEN FIRED, HE WOULD STILL BE WORKING. HE WAS STILL BE WORKING WITH THIS PERSON.
