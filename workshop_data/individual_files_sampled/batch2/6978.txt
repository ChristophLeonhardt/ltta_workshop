DEMOCRATIC SENATORS WANT TO STEP UP AND DEFEND UNDOCUMENTED IMMIGRANTS, AND ALSO PROTECT THEM FROM SOME OF THE MORE DRACONIAN POLICIES THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION IS ROLLING OUT, SO SENATOR JEFF MERKLEY WANTED TO VISIT A DETENTION CENTER IN TEXAS, WHICH BY THE WAY USED TO BE A WALMART APPARENTLY, TO SEE HOW CHILDREN ARE BEING TREATED IN THAT DETENTION CENTER. REMEMBER, ONE OF THE NEWER POLICIES OF THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION IS TO SEPARATE CHILDREN FROM THEIR PARENTS AT THE BORDER ONCE THEY TRY TO COME INTO THE COUNTRY, AND IF THEY GET CAUGHT. WELL, HERE IS WHAT HAPPENED WHEN SENATOR MERKLEY SHOWED UP TO THE FACILITY IN BROWNSVILLE, TEXAS, TAKE A LOOK. IS YOUR SUPERVISOR COMING OUT? MR. SANCHEZ, YOU ARE THE SUPERVISOR? LET ME INTRODUCE YOU TO MY TEAM. WHAT I'LL BE WITH YOU IN JUST A MINUTE. THIS IS A GOOD TIME TO TALK. I'M NOT ALLOWED TO GIVE A STATEMENT BUT I CAN GIVE YOU A NUMBER OF PEOPLE WHO COULD GIVE YOU A STATEMENT. THAT'S ON YOUR WEBSITE TOO AND I APPRECIATE THAT BUT YOU ARE THE SUPERVISOR. I'LL BE WITH YOU GUYS IN A MINUTE. THE SUPERVISOR IS HERE. DO YOU GUYS MIND? I DON'T MIND AT ALL. AS WE WALK OFF THE PROPERTY, I'VE BEEN ASKED TO LEAVE, I WILL COMPLY WITH THAT. SO HE SAYS THAT HE WAS IN TOUCH WITH SOMEONE AT THE FACILITY TO GET PERMISSION TO SEE IT PRIOR TO SHOWING UP, HE DIDN'T JUST SHOW UP AND EXPECT TO BE LET IN, BUT THEY DENIED HIM ACCESS, AND KEEP IN MIND THAT THIS IS A DETENTION FACILITY THAT IS BEING RUN BY THE OFFICE OF REFUGEE RESETTLEMENT. THAT ORGANIZATION HAS BEEN IN THE NEWS QUITE A BIT LATELY BECAUSE OF THE MISSING MIGRANT CHILDREN WHO HAD COME INTO THE COUNTRY BACK IN 2014. SO THAT WAS A PROBLEM ON ITS OWN, BUT THAT PROBLEM WILL NOW BE EXACERBATED CONSIDERING THE FACT THAT CHILDREN WILL BE SEPARATED FROM THEIR PARENTS AS THEY ATTEMPT TO COME INTO THE COUNTRY. LET IT SINK IN THAT WE HAVE SECRET DETENTION CENTERS IN AMERICA WHERE WE ARE HOUSING KIDS WHO HAVE BEEN SEPARATED FROM THEIR FAMILIES, AND THAT WE WILL NOT ALLOW UNITED STATES SENATORS TO GO INSIDE THEM. THAT IS THE COUNTRY WE ARE IN NOW. YOU'RE NOT GOING TO LET A SENATOR GO IN? WHO CAN GO IN? CAN THE PRESIDENT GO IN? PRESUMABLY, RIGHT? HE IS THE ONE WHO SET THEM UP IN THE FIRST PLACE. I'M SURE THE VICE PRESIDENT CAN, I'M SURE THE DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY CAN. CAN REPUBLICAN SENATORS GO IN? CAN TED CRUZ GO IN? IT'S IN TEXAS, HE'S A SENATOR FROM TEXAS. MY GUESS IS YOU WOULD LET HIM IN. ARE ONLY DEMOCRATIC SENATORS BLOCKED FROM GOING IN, OR ARE ALL OF OUR REPRESENTATIVES NOT ALLOWED TO SEE WHERE WE KEEP THE KIDS? LET THAT SINK IN. WE LIVE IN A SO-CALLED DEMOCRACY COME OUR REPRESENTATIVES ARE NOT ALLOWED INTO THESE SECRET DETENTION CENTERS. LET'S NOTE THE IRONY THAT CONSERVATIVES SAID THAT OBAMA WAS GOING TO START FEMA CAMPS WHERE THEY WOULD SECRETLY DETAIN PEOPLE AND NOT ALLOW ANYONE TO SEE THEM. THEIR CONCERNS WERE AMERICANS, BUT IF YOU ARE A MINOR WHO HAPPENS TO BE UNDOCUMENTED, THEN WE WILL TAKE YOU AWAY FROM YOUR PARENTS AND JUST DETAIN YOU INDEFINITELY WHILE YOUR PARENTS SEEK PROSECUTION. BY THE WAY, OFTENTIMES THESE ARE PEOPLE WHO SEEK REFUGE IN THE UNITED STATES, AND TRUMP'S REACTION OR RESPONSE TO THEM IS YOU ARE TRYING TO COME INTO THE U.S., WE ARE GOING TO PROSECUTE YOU, TAKE YOUR KIDS AWAY, DETAIN THEM, AND BY THE WAY NOT ALLOW OTHERS TO COME SEE WHAT THE CONDITIONS ARE IN THE DETENTION CENTERS, AND THEN WE WILL PROSECUTE YOU. BY THE WAY, FOR-PROFIT PRISONS ARE MAKING A KILLING OFF OF U.S. TAX DOLLARS FUNDING THEM SO PEOPLE CAN BE IN THERE AWAITING PROSECUTION. OF WALMART TURNED INTO A SECRET DETENTION CENTER IS MAYBE THE PERFECT SYMBOL FOR RIGHT-WING AMERICA. THE WHOLE THING IS STOMACH CHURNING. I WANT TO GIVE CREDIT TO SENATOR MERKLEY HERE. SOME PEOPLE ASKED ME WHO DO YOU THINK ARE THE MOST PROGRESSIVE SENATORS IN THE COUNTRY? BERNIE SANDERS AND ELIZABETH WARREN ARE EASY ANSWERS, BUT IF YOU DON'T KNOW, JEFF MERKLEY IS CERTAINLY AT THE TOP OF THAT LIST, HE'S AMONG THE TOP THREE, MAYBE EVEN MORE PROGRESSIVE THAN THE OTHER TWO IN SOME REGARDS. AND SO I LOVE WHAT HE DID HERE, BECAUSE THE DEMOCRATS ARE USUALLY QUITE HAPLESS IN THEIR ATTEMPTS TO SHINE A LIGHT ON THINGS THAT ARE GOING WRONG. THEY WILL DO THESE PRESS CONFERENCES WHERE THEY WILL BEG THE REPUBLICANS, STOP BEING SO MEAN TO US. MERKLEY ACTUALLY SHOWED UP AND SAID CAN I SEE THE PEOPLE YOU ARE HOLDING? YOU ARE PART OF THE U.S. GOVERNMENT, I'M A SENATOR IN THE U.S. GOVERNMENT, CAN I SEE THESE PEOPLE? AND I LOVE THAT HE BROUGHT A CAMERA. IS IT A PHOTO OP? HE'S GOING TO BE ATTACKED BY REPUBLICANS ENDLESSLY FOR IT. IS IT FOR SELF-AGGRANDIZEMENT? NO, IT IS TO LITERALLY PROTECT THE MOST POWERLESS PEOPLE IN THE COUNTRY, CHILDREN TAKEN AWAY FROM THEIR PARENTS IN A FOREIGN COUNTRY AND LOCKED INTO A WALMART TURNED INTO A PRISON. AND HE GOES TO HELP THEM. BLESS HIS HEART, THAT'S HOW YOU FIGHT BACK. FOLLOWING HIS LIVE VIDEO ON FACEBOOK ON THIS VERY INCIDENT THERE WAS ANOTHER SENATOR WHO SPOKE OUT, THAT WAS SENATOR BOB MENENDEZ, AND HE SAID THE FOLLOWING VIA TWITTER ARE THEY EVER GOING TO CLARIFY OR EVER ALLOW ANY OF OUR REPRESENTATIVES TO SEE THESE KIDS, OR DO WE JUST LIVE IN A POLICE STATE NOW WHERE PEOPLE CAN GET LOCKED UP AND YOU NEVER SEE THEM AGAIN? WELL, THOSE ARE IMPORTANT QUESTIONS FOR THE CRAZY STATE OF AMERICA AS WE HAVE IT TODAY.
