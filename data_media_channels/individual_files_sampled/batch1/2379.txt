you just said that you want me to help you do the dishes I want you to want to do the dishes why what I want to do dishes ah almost nobody responds to criticism without becoming defensive in some way so what you want to do is you want to be alert to anything you might say that's going to make the person go on the counter-attack to defend him or herself you say something positive you make the person feel aware of your love and support and what you think is good about them and then you you add the other bit it's a lot easier to hear the hard things when somebody has reassured you that you're loved you also need to be really careful in conflict not to get into what I call shame trading somebody does something that hurts the other person and then that person criticizes the person who is criticized then feels bad and tries to make the other person's feel bad and then you go back and forth trying to figure out who's the one who deserves the blame who's the one that ought to be ashamed of his or her behavior this is a pattern you see all the time in relationship
