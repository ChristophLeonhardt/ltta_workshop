we are now inside the two-month window to the midterm shaping up as an enormous test for both parties the Dems need 23 seats to flip control the house experts on both sides see at least 40 seats as competitive Republicans are facing the challenge of unusual first term losses combined with the president whose latest approval rating is below 40 percent one Republican operative told Axios quote every metric leads you to one conclusion the likelihood of significant Republican losses in the House and state local level is increasing by the week with us tonight Mike Murphy veteran GOP strategist longtime adviser to Mitt Romney Jeb Bush and John McCain and Mike by thanking you for coming on and putting on my Mike Murphy autograph model glass frames I'm gonna read you further pull outs from the q PAC poll 60% he's not honest 57% doesn't have good leadership skills 55% doesn't care about average Americans 65% feel our president isn't level-headed 60% doesn't share the same value values that I as a voter have 55% not fit to serve as president Mike what would you do if you had to run this guy for Congress I would lock him in a skiff somewhere and hire a robot to impersonate him for the next 60 days because he's had no success on getting an economic message of discipline to argue the one thing he's got going for him you know these descriptor numbers are very important they're with the real political operatives look at the job approval bounces around 38 42 mostly in the margin of error but if you look at these descriptors every almost every number he's got a majority or in a few cases of super majority that are on the negative side of the description with pretty hard language so that just shows the majority energy building in the country to really really punish him in the elections and if I were one of those worried congressman again I'd wish he had something in the White House basement to do or he would not be heard or seen the rest of the campaign at least a fire in those 40 districts that are in the most trouble and might what do you do if you're what we used to define as a kind of garden-variety middle-of-the-road Republican running for let's say re-election in a middle-of-the-road Republican district they're still out there both of those categories what do you do in that case well there are a couple there are a few members who run television now talking about when they you know stood up to their party they're trying to get their own identity either as the local fixer I did the casework I helped this lady I stood up for the local issue they're trying to get some distance the problem is the president when these numbers are so heavily against him and - he's so ubiquitous all over TV I mean right now he's running around trying to the slap a polygraph on each cabinet member this drama is 24/7 in the earned media so your local ads it's metric for Congress can't really overcome that so it's extremely frustrating to these folks I know a bunch of them and they know in some ways their future is not really in their hands anymore hey there I'm Chris Hayes from MSNBC thanks for watching MSNBC on YouTube if you want to keep up to date with the videos we're putting out you can click subscribe just below me or click over on this list to see lots of other great videos
