>> HE HAS BEEN RACE
IGLESIAS.
HE HAS BEEN SEXIST.
HE HAS BEEN ISLAMOPHOBIC.
ANTI-LBGTQ.
THERE IS A LONG LIST.
HE TALKS TO THAT AMERICA.
HE TALKS TO THEM ALL THE
TIME.
THEY T. IS A VERY HARD CORE
WHO ARE RESPONDING TO HIM
AND SUPPORTING HIM.
BRIAN: THAT HARD CORE MADE
HIM PRESIDENT.
HILLARY CLINTON IS BACK
GOING AFTER THE PRESIDENT
AND HIS SUPPORTERS AGAIN.
OUR NEXT GUEST CALLS THIS
ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF THE
LEFT'S DANGEROUS AND
IRRESPONSIBLE RHETORIC.
OR IS, IT JUST HILLARY
CLINTON?
HERE TO EXPLAIN IS FORMER
WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY
SEAN SPICER.
SEAN, HILLARY CLINTON'S
NUMBERS HAVE NEVER BEEN SO
LOW AMONG DEMOCRATS IN TERMS
OF POPULARITY IS THAT THE
REASON TO BELIEVE OR IS SHE
JUST ECHOING EVERYBODY
ELSE'S MESSAGE?
>> I THINK THAT'S PART OF
THE REASON.
PART OF THE REASON SHE LOST
THE CAMPAIGN SHE DOESN'T
RECOGNIZE THE 60-PLUS
MILLION PEOPLE THAT VOTED
FOR DONALD TRUMP FOR
PRESIDENT BECAUSE MOST OF
THOSE PEOPLE WANTED A VOICE
IN WASHINGTON.
THEY FELT LIKE THE SYSTEM
WAS LEAVING BEHIND THEIR
HARD WORKING AMERICANS THAT
JUST WANT TO PLAY BY THE
RULES.
WORK A HARD DAY.
AND HAVE THEIR GOVERNMENT
RESPECT THEM.
AND I THINK HILLARY CLINTON
STILL DOESN'T GET THEM.
AND EQUALLY, I MEAN, YOU
LOOK, THERE WERE TWO SIDES
ON THAT STAGE.
NOT JUST HILLARY CLINTON.
BUT THIS GUY FROM THE
ATLANTIC JEFFREY GOLDBERG
WHO DIDN'T ASK A FOLLOW-UP
QUESTION.
LET SO.
GO BY THE WAYSIDE.
HE IS PARSTD THE PROBLEM.
NOT JUST HILLARY CLINTON BUT
A LOT ON THE LEFT IN THE
MEDIA DON'T GET HOW MANY
FOLKS IN AMERICA SHARE THE
CONCERNS AND THE JEANGTED
AND THE POLICY THAT DONALD
TRUMP IS FORWARDING.
>> ANOTHER MAJOR STORY.
THAT
REAT
RENAFTA IN AWAY I HAVE NOT HEARD
RENAFTA IN AWAY I HAVE NOT HEARA
RENAFTA IN AWAY I HAVE NOT HEARY
RENAFTA IN AWAY I HAVE NOT HEARN
THE PRESIDENT REDID NAFLT
RENAFTA IN AWAY I HAVE NOT HEARE
BE CRITICAL OF.
THIS BETTER DEAL THAT
ACTUALLY HAS TECH AND IP IN
IT WHICH WASN'T THERE IN THE
1980S, OBVIOUSLY, HAS GOTTEN
PRAISE FROM CHUCK SCHUMER.
YOU THINK THAT'S BEEN
BURIED, WHY?
>> WELL, BECAUSE IT'S A WIN
FOR THE PRESIDENT.
BUT, LOOK, THIS PRESIDENT
AND A LOT OF PRESIDENTS HAVE
TALKED ABOUT RENEGOTIATING
NAFTA AS YOU RECALL
PRESIDENT OBAMA SAID HE WAS
GOING TO DO THAT AS A
CANDIDATE.
NOTHING HAPPENED.
THIS PRESIDENT SAID HE WAS
GOING TO DO IT.
AND HE DID IT.
AND IT BENEFITS OUR WORKERS,
OUR FARMERS, OUR RANCHERS,
OUR MANUFACTURERS.
AS YOU POINTED OUT.
I MEAN, NAFTA IS TWO AND A
HALF DECADES OLD.
THE IDEA THAT THE
INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY
PRENDSES, THE DIGITAL
PROPERTY RIGHTS WERE ALL
UPDATED.
THE LABOR STANDARDS, THE
ENVIRONMENTAL STANDARDS,
THINGS THAT DEMOCRATS HAVE
TALKED ABOUT FOR YEARS.
THE STUFF FOR THE AUTO
WORKERS.
THIS TREMENDOUS FOR OUR AUTO
WORKERS.
DAIRY FARMERS IN WISCONSIN.
WHAT THE PRESIDENT DID WAS
REMARKABLE.
BRIAN: IT IS, GUESS WHO ELSE
IT HELPS?
UNION MEMBERS.
EVEN MEXICO MIGHT RAISE
