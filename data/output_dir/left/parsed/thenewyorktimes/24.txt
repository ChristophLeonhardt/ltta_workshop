“The big question
of this show is
how does a decent guy
become dead inside,
at least morally?”
“When I started ‘Breaking
Bad,’ I was always worried
about giving the characters
a problem that I didn’t see
a way out of.”
“So what now?”
“My philosophy has
changed over the years.
And in the writers' room,
if we can’t figure out
how this character is going
to deal with this problem,
maybe the audience
can’t either.
In episode seven, Jimmy’s
sidekick is arrested.”
“He’s a cop.”
“We’ve written
ourselves into a corner.
Then we’re like,
all right, great.
Now, we have to
get him out of it.
What do we do?
What comes next?
The cop was assaulted.
How do you get away with that
in any way, shape or form?”
“You know, we came up with
so many different ideas,
but I think the thing
that got me excited
was just the idea of
an ocean of letters.”
“A ‘Miracle on 34th
Street’ kind of scene.”
“Are you prosecuting
Santa Claus?”
“Your honor?”
“Because it looks like
‘Miracle on 34th Street’
in here.”
“We came up with the idea of
this letter writing campaign
and the idea of Jimmy
having to travel all the way
to Louisiana to get the right
postmark on these letters.”
“How does he write
these letters?
He’s switching hands,
and switching pencils,
and using different
grips, and so forth.
Those handwritings are still
going to start to converge.
So he needs to get some
people to help him with this.”
“Ah, Jeanetta.
Very nice.
I like the hearts
over the I's.
It’s a real nice touch.
Would you like to
do some postcards?
It’s $0.50 per.”
“Yeah.”
“Different pens, please.”
“O.K.”
“He’s a kind man and a
good friend to everyone.
Jesus, they do make him
sound like Santa Claus.”
“This one has a phone number.”
“Let me see this.”
“In the best scam,
the mark feels smart.
And that was where the whole
idea of doing the telephone
gag came in.
We want the ADA to be able
to make a call to anybody
and find out that
this is true.”
“Hello, there.
Free Will Baptist —
Pastor Hansford speaking.
Who this?”
“His lines of what he
would and wouldn’t do,
and who’s an appropriate
target and who is not —
they’re fading very quickly.”
“But here’s a moment
when Jimmy comes alive.
And it’s because
he’s risking a lot
and he’s getting
to play a role.
He’s using this
Louisiana accent.”
“I’m going to step
into the vestibule.”
“Which, to be honest
with you, is something
that I saw him
do on 'Mr. Show.'”
“Now, this all reminds
me of a humorous story
of the traveling salesman.”
“Oh, there we go.
Have you set a date
yet for Huell’s trial?”
“No, not yet.”
“Well, would you
do me a kindness
and ring me up when
you do because we
got a couple of charter buses.
We’re going to bring the
whole congregation up
to y’all in Albuquerque.”
“As writers, you’re always
fascinated with someone who’s
creating their own reality.
We’re hoping to have
the audience suspend
their disbelief.
And the con artist is hoping
to suspend the disbelief
of his or her mark.”
“We are con artists.
We are trying to
con the audience
into believing that these
are plausible fictions.”
“Bless you and I look
forward to meeting you.”
