A LOT OF ROAD CLOSURES ARE IN 
THE WAY. 
DON'T RUSH TO THE SCENE. 
DON'T TRY TO GO IN THAT AREA. 
IF YOU NEED TO CONTACT SOMEONE 
AT A SCHOOL OR BUSINESS, DO IT 
VIA TELEPHONE OR SOCIAL MEDIA. 
DO NOT COMPLICATE THE ALREADY 
CHAOTIC AND ACTIVE AREA. 
>> THE HARTFORD COUNTY SHERIFF 
IS SAYING THAT THE SITUATION IS 
STILL VERY FLUID. 
WE DON'T HAVE ANY FOR 
INFORMATION ABOUT THE SUSPECT 
OR THE SUSPECT MAY BE. 
YOU CAN SEE THIS SHOT FROM 
CHOPPER 13. 
WE ARE BEING TOLD THEY ARE ONLY 
ALLOWED TO GET SO CLOSE BECAUSE 
OF THAT AREA. 
THEY NEED TO KEEP THE SKIES 
CLEAR AS THEY CONTINUE TO 
INVESTIGATE. 
THAT SO THE POLICE CHOPPERS CAN 
GET TO WHERE THEY NEED TO GO. 
>> THERE ARE STILL TRYING TO 
GET AS MUCH INFORMATION AS 
POSSIBLE AND TRYING TO MAKE 
SURE THE VICTIMS IN THE CASE 
ARE IN THE HOSPITAL, CAN MAKE 
IT TO THE HOSPITAL. 
AGAIN, THIS IS A LIVE LOOK FROM 
CHOPPER 13. 
>> AS RICK MENTIONED EARLIER, 
AND MIKE, THIS IS NOT TOO FAR 
FROM THE LAST SCENE THAT WE 
COVERED. AS RICK MENTIONED, IT 
WAS A YEAR AGO WHEN THERE WERE 
THREE WORKERS WERE KILLED AT A 
FACILITY. 
RICK, JUST REFRESH IT FOR US. 
THERE WAS ANOTHER SHOOTING IN 
DELAWARE. 
THAT'S A CONCERN, OF COURSE, 
WHERE THE SUSPECT MAY BE TODAY. 
>> I'M GLAD YOU BROUGHT THAT UP.
I JUST SPOKE WITH AUTHORITIES 
LITERALLY ONE MINUTE TO GO. 
THE SUSPECT HAS NOT BEEN TAKEN 
INTO CUSTODY YET. 
IT IS STILL AN ACTIVE SEARCH. 
IS NOT AN ACTIVE SHOOTING 
SITUATION BUT THE SUSPECT HAS 
NOT BEEN TAKEN INTO CUSTODY. 
THAT IS CERTAINLY A CONCERN. 
WHERE IS HE AT? 
IS THERE ANYBODY ELSE INVOLVED? 
AS FAR AS THE MEDIA STAGING 
AREA GOES, IT IS VERY QUIET 
OVER HERE. 
ABOUT 20 MINUTES AGO THERE WAS 
AN AMBULANCE THAT RACED BY. 
ACTUALLY TWEETED THAT OUT. 
ALSO UP HERE FROM THE BALTIMORE 
AREA ALONG 95, WE SAW SEVERAL 
UNMARKED POLICE CARS SPEEDING 
APPEAR TO HARFORD COUNTY. 
AND THEN THIS ROAD THAT IS 
CURRENTLY  BLOCKED AND CHOPPER 
13 WAS OVER THE AREA OR STILL 
IS OVER THAT AREA, WHICH IS 
WHERE THE SHOOTING TOOK PLACE, 
WE SAW SEVERAL UNMARKED POLICE 
CARS TRYING TO GET INTO THAT 
AREA AS WELL. 
OBVIOUSLY TRYING TO DO WHAT 
THEY CAN TO HELP. 
YOU BRING UP THE TWO PREVIOUS 
SHOOTINGS. 
OF COURSE THE ONE A COUPLE OF 
YEARS AGO AT PANERA BREAD WITH 
DEPUTIES. 
AND THEN THE ONE ALMOST A YEAR 
AGO THAT TOOK PLACE AT ADVANCED 
GRANITE SOLUTIONS. 
WHEN YOU GET HERE AND FOR ME TO 
BE SITTING HERE RIGHT NOW, IT 
IS HARD NOT TO THINK ABOUT THE 
SHOOTINGS AND HARD TO BELIEVE 
THAT HERE WE ARE AGAIN, 
LITERALLY LESS THAN A YEAR 
LATER AND A POSSIBLE ANOTHER 
WORKPLACE SHOOTING. 
WE KNOW MULTIPLE PEOPLE WERE 
SHOT AND WE ARE EXPECTED TO GET 
AN UPDATE AROUND 11:45 WITH 
MORE INFORMATION ON THIS 
TRAGEDY. 
AGAIN, THAT SUSPECT HAS NOT 
BEEN TAKEN INTO CUSTODY YET. 
>> STANDBY. 
WE JUST WANT TO UPDATE PARENTS. 
CHART -- CHURCH CREEK 
ELEMENTARIES ON A MODIFIED 
LOCKDOWN. 
THIS IS A BUSINESS PARK. 
THERE ISN'T A SCHOOL IN THE 
IMMEDIATE FACILITY. 
BUT THEY ARE DOING THAT CHURCH 
CREEK OUT OF CAUTION. 
THAT IS PROBABLY THE CLOSEST 
ONE IN PROXIMITY TO THE 
SHOOTING. 
RICK, THAT SUSPECT HAS NOT BEEN 
CAUGHT. SO THEY DON'T KNOW WHERE
HE OR SHE MAY BE AT THIS POINT. 
WHAT ARE YOU HEARING ABOUT THE 
POSSIBLE MEDIA BRIEFING? 
ARE THEY STILL GATHERING 
INFORMATION ON THE SUSPECT AND 
VICTIMS AS WELL? 
>> Reporter: I'M SORRY. 
I COULDN'T HEAR IF YOU'RE 
TALKING. 
WE ARE TRYING TO FIX THE 
BATTERY. 
THAT MEDIA BRIEFING IS SET FOR 
11:45. 
THEY SAID THE SUSPECT HAS NOT 
BEEN TAKEN INTO CUSTODY. 
THIS IS NOT STILL AN ACTIVE 
SHOOTER SITUATION BUT THE 
SEARCH FOR THE ALLEGED SHOOTER 
CONTINUES. 
IN A SITUATION LIKE THIS, YOU 
HAVE TO WONDER IF THIS IS ONE 
INDIVIDUAL, WAS THERE MULTIPLE 
PEOPLE INVOLVED? 
WE DON'T KNOW THAT. 
WE ARE EXPECTED TO GET AN 
UPDATE IN LESS THAN AN HOUR. 
AS FAR AS THIS AREA, 
SPECIFICALLY THE MEDIA AREA 
STAGING AREA IS PRETTY QUIET. 
WE SAW ONE AMBULANCE RACE BIKE 
RECENTLY. 
WE KEEP REITERATING THE MASSIVE 
AMOUNT OF UNMARKED POLICE CARS 
THAT WERE RACING UP 95 TRYING 
TO GET TO THE SCENE. 
THERE ARE COUPLE OF HOMES BY 
HERE. 
OBVIOUSLY, A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE 
STARTING TO CIRCLE IT OUT AND 
TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT IS 
GOING ON. 
OF COURSE, THEY ARE WORRIED. 
IF KIDS ARE IN SCHOOL, -- A LOT 
OF CONCERN AND A LOT OF DETAILS 
THAT HAVE NOT BEEN RELEASED. 
>> RICK, THANK YOU SO MUCH. 
WE'LL KEEP COMING BACK TO YOU. 
KIMBERLY IS ON THE WAY ALSO. 
GOVERNOR LARRY HOGAN JUST SENT 
OUT ANOTHER TWEET. 
IT IS INTERESTING, WE ARE 
GETTING SO MUCH INFORMATION AT 
ONE TIME. 
>> VIA SOCIAL MEDIA. 
>> YES. 
>> HE JUST TWEETED OUT THAT THE 
SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT IS ON THE 
SCENE AND STANDING BY TO OFFER 
ADDITIONAL SUPPORT. 
THE ATF IS ON THE SCENE AND THE 
FBI AS WELL. 
THE KEY PIECE OF INFORMATION, 
THIS IS SOMEONE WHO LIVES IN 
ABERDEEN. 
THEY SAY IT IS QUITE ODD THAT 
THEY BOTH HAPPENED SO CLOSE TO 
THE PROVING GROUNDS. 
THE KEY PIECE OF INFORMATION IS 
THEY ARE STILL LOOKING FOR THE 
SUSPECT. 
>> AND WE DON'T KNOW AT THIS 
POINT. 
>> WE HAD SOME CONCERNS ABOUT 
AREA SCHOOLS BUT BECAUSE THIS 
IS A BUSINESS PARK, THE SCHOOLS 
ARE NOT VERY CLOSE TO THE 
LOCATION. 
IF YOU'RE JUST TUNING IN, 
CHURCH CREEK ELEMENTARY IS ON A 
MODIFIED LOCKDOWN. 
THERE IS NO THREAT TO THE 
SCHOOL AT THIS POINT. 
THAT IS JUST OUT OF PERCUSSION. 
AGAIN, IF YOU HAVE CHILDREN, 
CHURCH CREEK ELEMENTARY. 
IT'S ALMOST EVERY TO HAVE THEM 
THERE. 
WE DON'T KNOW WHERE THE SUSPECT 
IS. 
11:45 MEDIA BRIEFING SO WE KNOW 
WHERE THIS TOOK PLACE. 
>> ABSOLUTELY. 
AND THE WITNESS MIKE SPOKE WITH 
WAS SAYING THE SAME THING. 
THERE ARE ONLY THREE WAYS IN 
AND OUT OF THAT AREA. 
EVERYTHING IS JAMMED TONIGHT 
WITH CREWS TRYING TO GET IN AND 
GETTING PEOPLE OUT TO THE 
HOSPITAL. 
THE TRAFFIC IS TIGHT AND THINGS 
ARE MOVING QUICKLY. 
THEY ARE ASKING PEOPLE TO AVOID 
THE AREA. 
THIS IS NORTH OF ABERDEEN. 
A SHOOTING IN THE AREA, 
MULTIPLE PEOPLE HAVE BEEN SHOT. 
PEOPLE ARE AT SHOCK TRAUMA. 
>> HARFORD COUNTY FIRE AND EMS  
IS TWEETING OUT RIGHT NOW THAT 
THEY ARE WORKING A SHOOTING 
INCIDENT AT THE RITE AID 
DISTRIBUTION CENTER IN 
ABERDEEN. 
WE ARE WORKING TO CONFIRM THAT 
BUT THAT IS PER THE FIRE 
DEPARTMENT. 
WE KNOW THIS IS IN THE BUSINESS 
DICHTER BUT WE ARE WAITING TO 
CONFIRM WHICH BUSINESS. 
THAT IS PER THE FIRE DEPARTMENT.
>> WHAT YOU ARE LOOKING AT IS 
PEOPLE BEING EVACUATED. 
>> WE DON'T KNOW WHERE THEY ARE 
GOING AGAIN, WE WERE TOLD THIS 
AREA IS VERY TIGHT. 
OF COURSE, THEY ARE TRYING TO 
GET THE EMERGENCY VEHICLES IN 
AND OUT. 
WE WANT TO CHECK BACK IN WITH 
RICK. 
HE IS ON SCENE RIGHT NOW. 
CAN YOU TELL US WHAT YOU ARE 
SEEING? 
>> Reporter: -- 
>> WE ARE HAVING TROUBLE. 
THEY ARE SAYING MULTIPLE PEOPLE 
HAVE BEEN SHOT. 
IT IS UNCLEAR IF THEY ARE FATAL.
A CONGRESSMAN TWEETING THAT HE 
IS MONITORING THE SHOOTING IN 
ABERDEEN. 
AND THEY ARE PRAYING FOR 
VICTIMS AND LOVED ONES. 
RICK, YOU MENTIONED THAT POLICE 
ARE SAYING NUMBER SHOTS ARE 
BEING FIRED. 
THEY ARE STILL LOOKING FOR A 
SUSPECT. 
AND ALSO I'M WONDERING IF YOU 
GOT THAT UPDATE FROM HARFORD  
COUNTY FIRE. 
>> Reporter: THAT'S WHAT I'M 
LOOKING AT RIGHT NOW. 
HARFORD COUNTY  TWEETING OUT 
THAT THIS TOOK PLACE AT THE 
RITE AID DISTRIBUTION CENTER. 
MULTIPLE PEOPLE HAVE BEEN SHOT 
AT THE RITE AID DISTRIBUTION 
CENTER. 
I WANT TO GO TO CHOPPER 13. 
THEY ARE OVER THAT SCENE. 
EMPLOYEES ARE BEING EVACUATED 
AND PUT ON SCHOOL BUSES. 
AGAIN, THIS IS NEW INFORMATION. 
WE WERE JUST TOLD MOMENTS AGO 
THAT THIS TOOK PLACE AT THE 
RITE AID DISTRIBUTION CENTER 
WERE MULTIPLE PEOPLE WERE SHOT. 
WE ARE AT OLD PHILADELPHIA ROAD.
WE ARE EXPECTED TO GET AN 
UPDATE IN ABOUT 35 MINUTES. 
THE BIGGEST DETAILED THAT JUST 
UNFOLDED, THE SHOOTING TOOK 
PLACE AT THE RITE AID 
DISTRIBUTION CENTER OVER THAT 
SCENE. 
MULTIPLE PEOPLE ARE BEING 
EVACUATED. 
MULTIPLE PEOPLE WERE SHOT. 
WE SAW AN EVELYN'S RACE BY 
ABOUT 15 TO 20 MINUTES AGO. 
-- AMBULANCE RACE BY ABOUT 15 TO
20 MINUTES AGO. 
THAT SUSPECT IS NOT YET IN 
CUSTODY. 
WHERE GOING TO GET MORE 
INFORMATION WHEN THIS 
AVAILABILITY TAKES PLACE IN 
LESS THAN 35 MINUTES. 
WE'LL START TO PIECE TOGETHER 
THE SITUATION. 
>> RICK, I JUST PULLED UP THEIR 
FACEBOOK PAGE -- THE RITE AID 
JUST ABUSE PAGE AND I'M LOOKING 
AT -- DISTRIBUTION PAGE, AND 
I'M LOOKING AT COMMENTS FROM 
EMPLOYEES. 
SEVERAL PEOPLE ARE SAYING THAT 
EITHER THEY ARE INSIDER NEARBY. 
IT IS STILL UNCLEAR AT THIS 
POINT. 
WE DID SEE THOSE BUSES TAKING 
PEOPLE OUT. 
AS MANY AS 1000 PEOPLE WORK AT 
THAT DISTRIBUTION CENTER. 
WE ARE TRYING TO GET MORE 
INFORMATION ABOUT THAT AS WELL. 
>> THE VICTIMS WERE TAKEN TO 
DELAWARE AND HERE IN MARYLAND. 
LET'S GO BACK TO MIKE. 
>> HE IS ON THE SCENE. 
CAN YOU UPDATE US SO FAR? 
>> Reporter: WE MOVED A LITTLE 
BIT CLOSER. 
WE HAVE BEEN TALKING ABOUT THAT 
RITE AID DISTRIBUTION CENTER. 
HERE IT IS. 
YOU CAN SEE THE MASSIVE POLICE 
PRESENCE. 
FBI, FDF, MILITARY PEOPLE, I 
SEE SOME ATF PEOPLE. 
A MASSIVE, MASSIVE POLICE 
PRESENT DISTRICT PRESENCE. 
THIS IS WHERE SPESUTIA ROAD 
ENDS.  
YOU CAN SEE THE ROADS ARE 
BLOCKED OFF. 
WE ARE LOOKING AT VIDEO FROM 
CHOPPER 13. 
IT'S AN ACTIVE SCENE. 
WE MENTIONED HOW THOSE SCHOOL 
BUSES WERE HELPING TO EVACUATE 
PEOPLE. 
THOSE SCHOOL BUSES CAME IN HERE 
ON SPESUTIA ROAD  WHEN WE WERE 
LIVE A FEW MINUTES AGO. 
THEY WERE EMPTY AND BROUGHT 
THEM TO THE SCENE TO THE RITE 
AID DISTRIBUTION CENTER. 
WE ALSO SAW A HONDA THAT WAS AT 
THIS CORNER. 
POLICE TOLD THAT AWAY -- TOWED 
THAT AWAY. 
WE DON'T KNOW IF THAT WAS 
CONNECTED TO THE SCENE. 
JUST A FEW MOMENTS AGO, WE 
TALKED TO A WOMAN WHO LIVES AND 
WORKS IN THE AREA ABOUT WHAT 
SHE IS SAYING. 
YOUR SHE IS. 
>> IT'S VERY SCARY -- HERE SHE 
IS. 
>> IT'S VERY SCARY WHEN IT IS 
ON YOUR DOORSTEP. 
IT STILL DOESN'T MAKE IT REAL 
TO YOU. 
IT'S REAL FOR A LOT OF PEOPLE 
RIGHT NOW. 
AND THERE ARE A LOT OF PEOPLE 
STILL AFFECTED BY THIS. 
THEY ARE STILL LOOKING. 
IT HAS BEEN A FEW HOURS AT THIS 
POINT OR ABOUT AN HOUR AND A 
HALF. 
IT'S INSANE. 
IT STILL SINKING IN. 
IT STILL CRAZY. 
>> Reporter: SO SHE LIVES IN 
THE AREA AND CAN'T GO BACK TO 
HER HOME WHILE THIS IS STILL AN 
ACTIVE SITUATION HERE. 
A LOT OF PLACES ARE BLOCKED OFF 
YOUR STILL. 
WE SAW SOME MORE STATE POLICE 
CRUISERS COMING TO THE SCENE. 
NOW THERE IS A BACKHOE THAT 
THEY ARE PASSING THROUGH THE 
AREA. 
THIS IS THE ENTRANCE TO THE 
RITE AID DISTRIBUTION CENTER. 
IT IS THE ENTERPRISE BUSINESS 
PARK IS WHAT IT SAYS ON THE 
SIGN HERE. 
THIS IS WHERE SPESUTIA ROAD 
ENDS. 
AT 9:06 THIS MORNING  THOSE 
FIRST CALLS CAME IN FOR HELP. 
POLICE LATER CONFIRMED THAT 
THIS WAS A MASS SHOOTING 
INCIDENT HERE IN HARFORD 
COUNTY.  
WITHOUT THEM TAKE AWAY ONE CAR 
FROM THE SCENE. 
THEY ARE GOING TO RELEASE MORE 
INFORMATION IN ABOUT A HALF 
HOUR FROM NOW. 
THAT IS AT 11:45 THIS MORNING. 
IT HAS BEEN NERVE-RACKING FOR 
THE PEOPLE WHO LIVE AND WORK IN 
THIS AREA. 
WE DON'T KNOW THE EXTENT OF 
INJURIES TO THOSE VICTIMS. 
WE DID SEE MULTIPLE AMBULANCES 
LEAVING THE SCENE, TAKING THOSE 
VICTIMS TO TRAUMA CENTERS IN 
THE AREA AND WE ARE CONTINUING 
TO SEE POLICE ARRIVE WITH 
FLASHING LIGHTS HERE AT THE 
SCENE. 
THIS IS STILL A FLUID AND OPEN 
INVESTIGATION RIGHT HERE. 
THEY HAVE LOCAL POLICE AGENCIES 
FROM AROUND THE AREA AND 
FEDERAL HELP IN THE FORM OF THE 
ATF AND FBI. 
WE EXPECT TO HEAR MORE DETAILS 
ABOUT HOW THIS UNFOLDED, IF 
THEY KNOW ANY MOTIVE, THERE ARE 
A LOT OF QUESTIONS THAT NEED TO 
BE ANSWERED IN THIS. 
THEY NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT 
THIS AREA IS SAFE. 
SO THEY GO METICULOUSLY THROUGH 
ANY BUILDINGS IF NEED BE TO 
MAKE SURE IT IS ALL CLEAR. 
I'M SEEING A NUMBER OF ATF 
AGENTS ACROSS THE STREET RIGHT 
NOW. 
THEY ARE ON THE SCENE IN THIS 
ACTIVE SITUATION HERE IN 
HARFORD COUNTY ON  SPESUTIA 
ROAD  JUST ACROSS THE STREET 
FROM THIS BUSINESS PARK. 
AGAIN, WE'LL GET THAT BRIEFING 
AT 11:45 WHERE THEY CAN FILL IN 
SOME MORE GAPS IN WHAT UNFOLDED 
HERE JUST AFTER 9:00 THIS 
MORNING BACK TO YOU. 
>> MIKE, YOU MENTIONED THAT 
THEY HAVE TO COMB THROUGH THIS 
BUILDING. 
I'M LOOKING AT THIS RIGHT NOW. 
IT SAID THIS FACILITY IS 
959,000 SQUARE FEET. 
IT IS UNCLEAR WHERE THE 
SHOOTING HAPPENED. 
YOU CAN SEE JUST HOW ENORMOUS 
THIS FACILITY IS. 
AND WITH 1000 OR MORE EMPLOYEES 
HAVING TO BE TAKEN OUT, THIS IS 
GOING TO TAKE QUITE SOME TIME. 
>> Reporter: IT IS. 
WE SAW THREE TO FOUR SCHOOL 
BUNCHES -- SCHOOL BUSES. 
AS WE MENTIONED, WE BELIEVE 
THOSE WERE EVACUATING EMPLOYEES 
FROM THE BUILDING. 
I DON'T KNOW WHERE THE SHOOTING 
HAPPENED. 
AS THEY FILL IN MORE DETAILS 
ABOUT THAT, WE WILL ALERT THE 
PUBLIC IF THERE IS AN ALL CLEAR 
HERE. 
WE DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY MAY 
HAVE TO SEARCH THROUGH BUT 
TYPICALLY WHEN SOMETHING LIKE 
THIS HAPPENS, IF IT HAPPENS IN 
A BUILDING, THEY HAVE TO GO 
METICULOUSLY THROUGH THE 
BUILDING, EVERY INCH TO MAKE 
SURE IT IS SAFE FOR PEOPLE. 
AGAIN, WE ARE STILL WAITING FOR 
DETAILS ON HOW THIS UNFOLDED 
AND ABOUT THE NUMBER OF VICTIMS 
AND THE EXTENT OF THEIR 
INJURIES HERE. 
AS WE LOOK ACROSS THE SCENE, 
YOU CAN SEE THIS IS THE 
ENTRANCE TO THE ENTRANCE PRICE 
-- ENTERPRISE BUSINESS PARK. 
WE WILL GET MORE DETAILS IN A 
FEW MINUTES. 
THIS IS STILL EARLY IN THE 
INVESTIGATION. 
THEY ARE TRYING TO GET TO THE 
BOTTOM OF WHAT HAPPED HERE. 
BACK TO YOU. 
>> MIKE, THANK YOU. 
WE ALSO WANT TO CAUTION -- WE 
ARE FOLLOWING THIS ON SOCIAL 
MEDIA AND NOT ALL THE REPORTS 
ARE CORRECT. 
WE ARE ONLY GOING TO REPORT 
EXACTLY WHAT WE'RE HEARING FROM 
POLICE. 
WE ARE WAITING FOR THAT 
BRIEFING THAT SHOULD HAPPEN IN 
ABOUT HALF AN HOUR. 
RICK AND MIKE ARE LIFE THERE. 
-- LIVE THERE. 
>> ALL WE'RE SAYING IS THAT IT 
IS AN ACTIVE SCENE AND THERE 
ARE MULTIPLE VICTIMS. 
THAT'S ALL WE KNOW AT THIS 
TIME, OFFICIALLY. 
HERE'S A TWEET FROM THE HARFORD 
COUNTY  FIRE AND EMS. 
>> FIRE UNITS ARE WORKING IN A 
SHOOTING AT RITE AID 
DISTRIBUTION CENTER IN 
ABERDEEN.  
THE SCENE IS STILL VERY FLUID. 
WE DO KNOW THAT SEVERAL ROADS 
ARE ALSO CLOSED. 
THAT MEDIATE STAGING AREAS 
WHERE RICK IS NOW. 
>> AGAIN, THE GOVERNOR HAS SENT 
STATE POLICE TO ASSIST WITH THE 
HARFORD COUNTY SHERIFF'S 
DEPARTMENT.  
THE GOVERNOR SAYING WE STAND 
READY TO OFFER ADDITIONAL 
SUPPORT NEEDED. 
THERE IS TREMENDOUS RESPONSE TO 
THE SCENE, OF COURSE. 
>> AND THEN ALSO, KURT TWEETED 
THIS OUT. 
HE LIVES IN ABERDEEN. 
HE SAID ABERDEEN HAD A SIMILAR 
SHOOTING TWO YEARS AGO. 
IT IS QUITE ODD THAT THEY BOTH 
HAPPENED SO CLOSE AND SO CLOSE 
TO ABERDEEN PROVING GROUND 
WHICH IS VERY SAFE AND VERY 
WELL PROTECTED. 
LET'S GO BACK OUT LIVE TO RICK 
WHO IS IN THAT MEDIATE STAGING 
AREA. 
-- MEDIA STAGING AREA. 
IT'S VERY IMPORTANT FOR POLICE 
TO MONITOR WHERE THE SUSPECT 
COULD BE. 
>> Reporter: I WANT TO GET TO 
SOME NEW INFORMATION THAT JUST 
CAME IN MOMENTS AGO. 
SOURCES HAVE CONFIRMED THAT 
MULTIPLE PEOPLE HAVE BEEN 
KILLED IN THIS SHOOTING. 
AGAIN, LITERALLY MOMENTS AGO 
THAT ASSOCIATE PRESS SAYING 
SOURCES TELL THEM MULTIPLE 
PEOPLE HAVE BEEN KILLED IN THIS 
SHOOTING AT THE RITE AID 
DISTRIBUTION CENTER.  
IT TOOK PLACE AROUND 9:00 THIS 
MORNING OFF OF SPESUTIA ROAD.  
MULTIPLE PEOPLE ARE BEING 
EVACUATED FROM THAT BUILDING. 
OF BUILDING WERE MORE THAN 1000 
EMPLOYEES WORK. 
MULTIPLE PEOPLE WERE KILLED IN 
THIS HORRIFIC SHOOTING. 
THAT NEW INFORMATION COMING IN 
MOMENTS AGO. 
WE ARE EXPECTED TO GET AN 
UPDATE IN ABOUT 20 MINUTES. 
WE'RE EXPECTING TO TRY TO PIECE 
THIS TOGETHER. 
JUMPING BACK TO THE OTHER 
TRAGEDY A YEAR AGO TOOK PLACE 
ABOUT SEVEN MILES FROM HERE. 
THEY TOOK PLACE SO CLOSE. 
OBVIOUSLY, THAT WHEN TAKING 
PLACE AT A MUCH SMALLER 
WORKPLACE. 
ONLY ABOUT 20 OR 30 EMPLOYEES 
WITH THAT. 
THIS IS A LOT MORE SCARY WHEN 
YOU HAVE 1000 EMPLOYEES ARE SO 
INSIDE A DISTRIBUTION CENTER 
WHERE SHOTS RANG OUT AND 
MULTIPLE PEOPLE HAVE NOW BEEN 
KILLED. 
WE ARE EXPECTED TO GET AN 
UPDATE WITHIN ABOUT 20 MINUTES 
OR SO. 
THE GOVERNOR PUT OUT 
INFORMATION SAYING THAT THE 
STATE IS STANDING BY AND READY 
TO ASSIST IN ANY WAY POSSIBLE. 
HE CALLED THIS A HORRIFIC 
INCIDENT. 
MULTIPLE PEOPLE WERE KILLED. 
WE ARE EXPECTED TO GET AN 
UPDATE IN 20 MINUTES OR SO. 
>> RICK, WE WERE TALK ABOUT 
EDGEWOOD AND PANERA BREAD, WE 
HAVE HAD GREAT MILLS, THE 
CAPITAL GAZETTE, AND NOW THIS. 
>> THESE ARE CLEARLY EXPLOSIVE 
TIMES. 
WHAT RICK IS SAYING IS CORRECT, 
WE ARE SAYING THAT THIS 
INFORMATION COMES FROM AP. 
THEY ARE SETTING AN OFFICIAL AS 
A SOURCE. 
IF YOU KNOW SOMEONE WHO LIVES 
OR EXCUSE ME, WORKS IN THE 
AREA, WE DON'T HAVE NUMBERS IN 
TERMS OF VICTIMS. 
WE DON'T HAVE ANY IDENTITIES. 
AP IS CITING AN OFFICIAL AS A 
SOURCE OF SAYING THAT THERE ARE 
FATALITIES IN THAT'S MASS 
SHOOTING. 
CLEARLY IT IS EXTREMELY 
DISTRESSING FOR ANYONE WHO 
WORKS THERE, LIVES THERE, OR 
KNOW SOMEONE WHO WORKS THERE. 
>> WE ARE ALSO SEEING REPORTS 
THAT WE DON'T KNOW HOW THIS 
PERSON WAS CONNECTED BUT IT MAY 
HAVE BEEN A MAN OR WOMAN. 
WE DON'T KNOW MUCH ABOUT THE 
SUSPECT WE ARE WAITING TO HEAR 
FROM POLICE. 
AGAIN, SOME OF THE VICTIMS HAVE 
BEEN TAKEN TO MARYLAND 
HOSPITALS AND SOME HAVE BEEN 
TAKEN UP TO DELAWARE BECAUSE OF 
THE CLOSE PROXIMITY TO DELAWARE.
THIS IS JUST SOUTH OF ABERDEEN. 
YOU'RE LOOKING LIVE AT THE 
SCHOOL BUSES THAT ARE TAKING 
SOME OF THE EMPLOYEES FROM THE 
RITE AID DISTRIBUTION CENTER.  
WE ARE TOLD THERE ABOUT 1000 
EMPLOYEES. 
THE BUILDING IS ABOUT 959,000 
SQUARE FEET. 
>> WE ARE GOING TO GO BACK TO 
MIKE NOW WHO IS OUTSIDE OF THE 
VICINITY AWAITING OFFICIAL WORD 
FROM LAW ENFORCEMENT. 
ONCE AGAIN, THE REPORTS THAT 
THERE ARE MULTIPLE VICTIMS ARE 
BEING CITED BY AN AP REPORTER 
WHO SAYS THEY GOT THAT 
INFORMATION FROM A LAW 
ENFORCEMENT OFFICIAL WHO WANTS 
TO REMAIN ANONYMOUS. 
SO ALTHOUGH WE TRUST THE 
VALIDITY OF AN AP REPORTER WE 
WANT TO QUALIFY THAT 
INFORMATION FOR THOSE OF YOU 
WHO ARE EXTREMELY DISTRESSED. 
WE ARE THE LAST PRIORITY FOR 
LAW ENFORCEMENT RIGHT NOW. 
BUT THEY ARE GOING TO SOME SORT 
OF OFFICIAL STATEMENT WHICH WE 
WILL CARRY LIVE, OF COURSE. 
WE ARE NOW SEEING, AGAIN, 
MEDEVAC. 
IT IS VERY DISTRESSING FOR 
PEOPLE AT HOME TO CURE THINGS 
LIKE MULTIPLE VICTIMS. 
LET'S GO TO MIKE. 
MIKE. 
>> Reporter: THE MEDIC CAP -- 
MEDEVAC HELICOPTER IS JUST OVER 
MY HEAD. 
THERE WAS ANOTHER ONE LANDING 
HERE. 
WE SAW TWO PUBLIC SCHOOL BUSES. 
THEY BROUGHT THEM IN EMPTY, 
THEY ARE TAKING PEOPLE OUT AND 
HEADING OUT OF THE BUSINESS 
PARK FOLLOWED BY A NUMBER OF 
POLICE OFFICERS. 
AND THE AP AS YOU HAVE 
MENTIONED, I WANT TO READ THE 
EXACT BULLETIN AT 11:10 AM, AN 
OFFICIAL SAYS MULTIPLE PEOPLE 
HAVE BEEN KILLED IN A SHOOTING 
IN HARFORD COUNTY,  MARYLAND. 
THEY WEREN'T AUTHORIZED TO 
DISCUSS DETAILS BY NAME AND 
SPOKE ON CONDITION OF ANONYMITY 
TO THE ASSOCIATED PRESS. 
THE HARFORD COUNTY  SHERIFF'S 
OFFICE TWEETED THERE WAS A 
SHOOTING THAT INCLUDES MULTIPLE 
VICTIMS HERE. 
THE HELICOPTERS OVERHEAD HERE. 
THERE IS ANOTHER ONE THAT WAS 
LANDING. 
WE ARE MONITORING THE 
SITUATION. 
ALSO FROM CHOPPER 13 -- END 
THREE SCHOOL BUSES FILLED WITH 
PEOPLE FROM THIS BUSINESS PARK 
-- AND THREE SCHOOL BUSES 
FILLED WITH PEOPLE FROM THIS 
BUSINESS PARK. 
AGAIN, WE ARE WAITING FOR 
OFFICIAL WORD ON ANY FATALITIES 
FROM THE HARFORD COUNTY  
SHERIFF'S OFFICE AT THEIR PRESS 
BRIEFING WHICH IS SCHEDULED AT 
11:45. 
SO IT IS A FLUID SCENE HERE 
OUTSIDE OF THIS RITE AID 
DISTRIBUTION CENTER . AND STILL 
OFFICIALS ARE ARRIVING HERE AT 
THE SCENE. AGAIN, THE 
ASSOCIATED PRESS REPORTING THAT 
MULTIPLE PEOPLE HAVE BEEN 
KILLED IN THIS SHOOTING IN 
HARFORD COUNTY. 
I SEE A STATE POLICE  
SPOKESPERSON HERE AT THE SCENE 
JUST ACROSS THE STREET. BUT WE 
ARE THINKING THAT HARFORD 
COUNTY  SHERIFF'S OFFICE IS 
LEADING THE INVESTIGATION AND 
WILL BE PROVIDING THAT BRIEFING 
AS WE GET MORE -- AND YOU CAN 
SEE FROM THE LIVE CAMERA ON THE 
GROUND, I'M WATCHING THE 
MEDEVAC CHOPPER JUST A FEW FEET 
IN FRONT OF ME AS IT GOES DOWN 
HERE JUST OFF OF SPESUTIA ROAD. 
THAT CHOPPER IS LANDING NOW 
HERE AT THE SCENE. WE DON'T 
KNOW HOW THIS SITUATION UNFOLDED
AND IF THERE ARE MORE VICTIMS 
INSIDE. 
WE DON'T KNOW IF MEDEVAC WOULD 
NEED TO TRANSPORT TO A TRAUMA 
CENTER BUT WE ARE WATCHING THAT 
CHOPPER LAND AT THIS ENTERPRISE 
BUSINESS PARK  RIGHT NOW. AND 
MOMENTS AGO, WE SOUGHT THEM 
EVACUATE THREE BUSLOADS OF 
PEOPLE BEFORE THE CHOPPER THAT 
CIRCLED AROUND IS NO LANDING 
HERE AT THE ENTERPRISE BUSINESS 
PARK.  
ACCORDING TO THE AP, MULTIPLE 
PEOPLE ARE DEAD AFTER A 
SHOOTING THAT UNFOLDED JUST 
AFTER 9:00 THIS MORNING. 
>> SORRY TO INTERRUPT BUT THERE 
HAS BEEN AN UPDATE FROM AP. 
WHEN WE SAY MULTIPLE THEY ARE 
NOW SAYING THREE PEOPLE ARE 
DEAD. 
THERE MAY BE MANY MORE INJURED. 
BUT ACCORDING TO THE AP, THERE 
HAVE BEEN DEATHS AND THREE ARE 
DEAD. 
THEY ARE NOT SAYING THE 
IDENTITIES OF THE PEOPLE OR IF 
A SUSPECT IS AMONG THEM. 
THIS EVENT HAPPENED OVER TWO 
HOURS AGO. 
THE FACT THAT A MEDEVAC HAS 
JUST LANDED MEANS EITHER THEY 
HAVE FOUND ANOTHER VICTIM IN 
THE SEARCH OR THERE HAS BEEN 
DRAMATIC ELEMENT WITHIN THE LAST
HOUR OR SO. 
BECAUSE IT JUST LANDED JUST 
NOW. 
>> WE ALSO KNOW THE SUSPECT IS 
NOT IN CUSTODY. 
WE ARE GETTING REPORTS ABOUT 
THAT SUSPECT BUT WE ARE WAITING 
FROM -- FOR PROBATION FROM 
POLICE. 
-- CONFIRMATION FROM POLICE. 
SEVERAL AREAS NEARBY WERE 
VICTIMS COULD HAVE BEEN 
TRANSPORTED. 
AS DENISE MENTIONED, THREE HAVE 
BEEN CONFIRMED DEAD ACCORDING 
TO THE ASSOCIATED PRESS. 
HOWEVER, THERE MAY BE MORE 
VICTIMS AND THAT'S WHAT WE'RE 
TRYING TO FIGURE OUT. 
AT THIS POINT, WE AREN'T 
GETTING MUCH INFORMATION ABOUT 
THE SUSPECT WE DON'T KNOW IF 
THAT SUSPECT WORKS AT THAT 
FACILITY. 
WE DO KNOW ABOUT 1000 PEOPLE 
ARE EMPLOYED AT THAT FACILITY. 
IT IS INCREDIBLY LARGE. 
DENISE, CHURCH CREEK ELEMENTARY 
IS ON A LOCKDOWN. 
THAT IS OUT OF CAUTION. 
THAT IS THE CLOSEST SCHOOL BUT 
WE ARE STILL WAITING FOR 
INFORMATION. 
>> WE'LL CONTINUE TO COVER THIS 
LIFE -- LIVE. 
A MASS SHOOTING, AN ACTIVE 
SCENE AND THREE PEOPLE ARE DEAD.
>>> LIVE FROM TELEVISION HILL, 
THIS IS WJZ BREAKING NEWS. 
>> IF YOU'RE EXPECTING REGULAR 
PROGRAMMING WE ARE INTERRUPTING 
IT TO FOLLOW A SHOOTING THAT 
HAS TAKEN PLACE THIS MORNING AT 
ABOUT 9:06 AT AN INDUSTRIAL 
PARK IN HARFORD COUNTY.  
YOU'RE LOOKING LIVE AT THE SCENE
WHICH IS WHAT WE BELIEVE IS 
EIGHT RITE AID DISTRIBUTION 
CENTER.  
WE KNOW NOW IT IS AND -- AN 
ACTIVE SCENE. 
THERE ARE MULTIPLE VICTIMS AND 
WE BELIEVE THREE PEOPLE HAVE 
BEEN CONFIRMED DEAD IN THE 
SHOOTING. 
THAT IS WHAT WE KNOW AT THIS 
TIME. 
>> WE ARE GOING TO GO BACK TO 
RICK RITTER. 
THAT WAS JUST 11 MONTHS AGO 
WHERE THREE PEOPLE WERE KILLED 
IN THAT INCIDENT, LESS THAN 10 
MILES AWAY. 
>> Reporter: HARFORD COUNTY HAS 
DEALT WITH  AN INSANE AMOUNT OF 
GRIEF OVER THE LAST COUPLE OF 
YEARS. 
THAT SHOOTING TOOK PLACE ABOUT 
11 MONTHS AGO AT ADVANCED 
GRANITE SOLUTIONS. THAT'S A 
WORKPLACE THAT ONLY HAD ABOUT 
20 OR 30 EMPLOYEES. 
THIS ONE TAKING PLACE AT THE 
RITE AID DISTRIBUTION CENTER 
WITH MORE THAN 1000 EMPLOYEES.  
YOU BOTH MENTIONED THE NEW 
INFORMATION THAT JUST CAME IN 
FROM THE ASSOCIATED PRESS. 
THEY ARE NOW REPORTING THAT 
THREE PEOPLE HAVE BEEN KILLED 
IN THIS SHOOTING. 
THREE PEOPLE WERE KILLED, THAT 
IS ACCORDING TO THE ASSOCIATED 
PRESS. 
THIS TOOK PLACE AROUND 9:00 
THIS MORNING OFF THIS SPESUTIA 
ROAD AT THE RITE AID 
DISTRIBUTION CENTER.  
CHOPPER 13 WAS OVER THAT SCENE 
JUST A WHILE AGO. 
WE SAW HUNDREDS OF EMPLOYEES 
BEING EVACUATED FROM THAT 
WAREHOUSE AND BEING PUT ON 
SCHOOL BUSES. 
IT'S OBVIOUSLY A SCARY 
SITUATION. 
WE ARE TRYING TO PIECE TOGETHER 
THIS SITUATION. 
WE ARE LIVE RIGHT NOW AT THE 
MEDIA STAGING AREA.  
WE ARE ABOUT A MILE FROM WHERE 
THE SHOOTING TOOK PLACE. 
WE ARE EXPECTED TO GET AN 
UPDATE WITHIN THE NEXT 15 
MINUTES. 
I WAS TOLD THAT A SUSPECT HAS 
NOT BEEN TAKEN INTO CUSTODY 
YET. 
THERE ARE SOME REPORTS 
CIRCULATING THAT ARE SUGGESTING 
DIFFERENTLY. 
AUTHORITIES SAY RIGHT NOW THEY 
CANNOT SAY IF THAT SUSPECT WAS 
TAKEN INTO CUSTODY. 
HOPEFULLY WE'LL GET AN UPDATE 
WITHIN THE NEXT 15 MINUTES OR 
SO. 
>> WHAT YOU'RE SAYING IS WE CAN 
VERIFY. 
IT SEEMS LIKE THERE IS A LOT OF 
PANIC AND EMOTION IN THE 
COMMUNITY WHICH IS ENTIRELY 
UNDERSTANDABLE. 
INFORMATION STARTS GETTINGS 
BREAD LIKE CRAZY. 
-- GETTING SPREAD LIKE CRZY. 
ACCORDING TO AN AP REPORTER, 
THREE PEOPLE ARE BEING -- ARE 
DEAD. 
WE KNOW THE HARFORD COUNTY 
SHERIFF'S OFFICES THERE.  
THE FBI IS TWITTING OUT IT IS 
RESPONDING AS WELL AS THE ATF. 
THEIR AGENTS ARE RESPONDING AS 
WELL. 
AS WELL AS STATE POLICE. 
THE GOVERNOR SENT STATE POLICE 
THERE. 
THIS IS A VERY MASSIVE LOCATION.
YOU HAVE AN ARMY OF LAW 
ENFORCEMENT THERE RIGHT NOW. 
I IMAGINE -- TAKE A LOOK, IT 
LOOKS LIKE NATIONAL GUARD IS 
THERE. 
YOU HAVE A TREMENDOUS SEARCH 
GOING ON RIGHT NOW FOR ANY 
VICTIMS AND OR A SUSPECT. 
>> WE ARE ALSO WAITING TO HEAR 
FROM ABERDEEN POLICE REGARDING 
THIS SHOOTING. 
THEY ARE WORKING ON A STAGING 
AREA FOR FAMILIES TO BE 
REUNITED. 
THAT INFORMATION IS 
FORTHCOMING. 
WE'LL BRING YOU THAT AS QUICKLY 
AS POSSIBLE. 
WE ARE GOING TO GO NOW TO 
NICOLE WHO WERE STANDING BY. 
SO MUCH OF THIS INFORMATION IS 
BEING FILTERED IN THROUGH 
SOCIAL MEDIA. 
THAT'S HOW THE POLICE AND THE 
ATF AND THE FIRE DEPARTMENT ARE 
ALSO PROVIDING INFORMATION TO 
THE MEDIA SO WE CAN CONVEY THAT 
INFORMATION TO YOU. 
NICOLE, WHAT ARE YOU SEEING? 
>> Reporter: A LOT OF 
INFORMATION IS COMING IN. 
WE ARE SEEING PEOPLE MARKING 
THEM -- THEMSELVES SAFE ON 
TWITTER. 
I'M HURT AND ANGRY THAT THIS 
KEEPS HAPPENING AND I'M AFRAID 
OF HOW CLOSE THEY ARE GETTING. 
TO SOME PEOPLE STILL WON'T BE A 
WAKE-UP CALL MAKING ME EVEN 
MORE ANGRY. 
WE ALSO HAVE A TWEET FROM THE 
GOVERNOR WHO SAYS WE ARE 
CLOSELY MONITORING THE HORRIFIC 
SHOOTING. 
PRAYERS ARE WITH THOSE IMPACTED 
INCLUDING FIRST RESPONDERS. 
OF COURSE, THE STATE IS 
STANDING BY READY TO OFFER 
SUPPORT. 
IF YOU ARE IN THE AREA, WE DO 
HAVE A HASHTAG THAT WE ARE 
USING. 
DENISE. 
>> THANK YOU, NICOLE. 
YOU HAVE A LOT OF EMPLOYEES. 
WE DON'T HAVE NUMBERS YET BUT I 
AM SURE IT IS IN THE HUNDREDS. 
FAMILY MEMBERS ARE AT HOME 
WORRIED NOW. 
UNDERSTANDABLY SO. 
AS SOON AS WE GET VERIFIABLE 
INFORMATION WE WILL BRING THAT 
TO YOU. 
WE PROMISE. 
WE WILL REMAIN UNSEEN WITH OUR 
REPORTERS. 
>> I THINK THIS WAS BEFORE YOU 
JOINED US, ABOUT 1000 EMPLOYEES.
>> LOOK AT THE SIZE OF THAT. 
MASSIVE, MASSIVE INSTALLATION 
THERE. 
>> MORE THAN 900,000 SQUARE FEET
AND THERE ABOUT THREE DIFFERENT 
RITE AID DISTRIBUTION CENTER  S 
IN THIS AREA -- OR I SHOULD SAY 
ON THE EAST COAST. 
THIS IS ONE OF THE LARGEST. 
THEY HOUSE ALL SORTS OF 
MEDICINES IN ALL DIFFERENT PARTS
-- AS MIKE WAS EXPLAINING, THEY 
HAVE TO COMB THROUGH EVERY 
AREA. 
LET'S GO BACK TO MIKE. 
MIKE. 
>> Reporter: WE ALSO JUST 
LEARNED THAT A NUMBER OF PEOPLE 
WERE TAKEN TO HOPKINS BAYVIEW. 
THEY ARE GOING TO HOLD A PRESS 
CONFERENCE AT 12:30. 
WE ARE GOING TO BE COVERING 
THAT AS WELL AS AT 11:45 
HARFORD COUNTY SHERIFF'S OFFICE 
IS HOLDING A BRIEFING. 
WE SAW AN ATF CANINE GOING INTO 
THE SCENE. 
WE ALSO SAW SOME AGENTS WITH 
LARGE WEAPONS GOING INTO THE 
SCENE. 
THERE IS A SEMI THAT I AM 
WATCHING AS A COMES OUT OF THE 
ENTRANCE TO THE CENTER. 
THIS IS THE FIRST VEHICLE THAT 
IS NOT A POLICE VEHICLE THAT WE 
KNOW THAT I'VE SEEN LEAVING THE 
SCENE HERE. 
YOU CAN SEE A LARGE LAW 
ENFORCEMENT PRESENCE AS THAT 
SEMI LEAVES THE BUSINESS PARK 
HERE. ABOUT 10 MINUTES AGO, WE 
SAW THE MEDEVAC CHOPPER LAND. 
WE DON'T KNOW IF THEY ARE 
TRYING TO HELP OUT VICTIMS. 
WE HAVE NOT SEEN THAT CHAPTER 
-- CHOPPER LEAVE AT THIS POINT. 
YOU CAN SEE THE SEMI LEAVING 
THE BUSINESS PARK HERE IN 
HARFORD COUNTY.  
THIS IS ANOTHER POLICE VEHICLE 
BEHIND IT. 
POLICE HAVE BLOCKED OFF THIS 
SCENE. IT'S A SECURE SCENE. 
A LOT OF FEDERAL AGENTS ARE 
HERE. 
I MAY HAVE LOST MY AUDIO 
CONNECTION TO YOU. 
BUT AGAIN, WE ARE WAITING FOR 
BRIEFING IN ABOUT 10 MINUTES 
HERE. 
I HEAR YOU AGAIN. 
THERE YOU CAN SEE THAT RESCUE 
VEHICLE. 
HARFORD COUNTY  RESCUE VEHICLE 
IS HERE. 
AND THE SHERIFF'S OFFICE 
VEHICLES ARE BEHIND IT. 
THERE IS A CONTINGENT HERE 
COMING IN. FOUR DIFFERENT 
VEHICLES INCLUDING A 
MILITARIZED VEHICLE THAT IS 
HEADING TO THE ENTRANCE HERE OF 
THIS RITE AID DISTRIBUTION 
CENTER  ON SPESUTIA ROAD. 
FOUR DIFFERENT VEHICLES.  
WITHOUT THAT MEDEVAC CHOPPER 
LAND A FEW MINUTES AGO. 
AND THAT IS STILL ON THE SCENE. 
AGAIN, THEY ARE BRINGING IN 
MORE VEHICLES HERE. ACCORDING 
TO THE ASSOCIATED PRESS, THREE 
PEOPLE ARE DEAD HERE. 
WE ARE STILL WAITING TO HEAR 
MORE INFORMATION ABOUT THE 
SUSPECT HERE. 
WHAT YOU CAN SEE THIS IS STILL 
AN ACTIVE SCENE AS THIS 
CONTINGENT OF VEHICLES GOES 
INTO THE BUSINESS PARK HERE 
WHERE THE SHOOTING HAPPENED 
JUST ABOUT 2 1/2 HOURS AGO. 
AGAIN, THREE PEOPLE ARE DEAD ON 
THE SCENE. 
A BRIEFING TO COME IN A FEW 
MINUTES. 
AND STILL AN ACTIVE SEEN AS 
MORE LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS 
COME HERE. 
I SEE ANOTHER FOUR, SIX, SEVEN 
VEHICLES. 
THEY ARE JUST COMING AND COMING 
HERE ON SPESUTIA ROAD  AT THE 
ENTRANCE TO THE FACILITY HERE. 
IT LOOKS LIKE SOMETHING HAS 
HAPPENED. 
WE DON'T KNOW WHAT. 
WE DON'T KNOW THE STATUS OF THE 
SUSPECT OR SUSPECTS. AGAIN, A 
LARGE CONTINGENT OF OFFICERS 
ARE HERE AT THE SCENE AND WE 
WILL INTERNET ARE TO MONITOR 
THE SITUATION HERE ON SPESUTIA 
ROAD.  
>> WE WERE LOOKING LIFE AT THE 
STAGING AREA IN FRONT OF ONE OF 
THE AREAS. 
IT LOOKS AS IF LAW ENFORCEMENT 
IS ABOUT TO ENTER THE VEHICLE. 
THEY HAVE NO IDEA IF THERE ARE 
EXPLOSIVES LEFT BEHIND. 
WE DON'T KNOW, THE SUSPECT 
COULD BE INSIDE. 
IF THE SUSPECT IS INSIDE, WHICH 
AREA OF WHICH BUILDING? 
THAT'S WHY THERE IS THIS 
ENORMOUS POLICE PRESENCE. 
THEY HAVE TO DEAL WITH THE 
FACILITY. 
THE FACILITY TAKES PEOPLE AT 
EVERY ENTRANCE AND SCOURING 
EVERY INCH. 
AS OF 11:25, IT WAS STILL BE -- 
BEING CALLED AN ACTIVE SHOOTER 
SCENE. 
IF THERE IS A SUSPECT WHO HAS 
BEEN ARRESTED, WE HAVE NOT BEEN 
INFORMED. 
EVEN THOUGH THERE ARE RUMORS, 
WE HAVE NO WAY OF SAYING IF 
SOMEBODY IS IN CUSTODY. 
AS WE LOOK AT IT, THAT'S 
EXACTLY HOW IT APPEARS. 
THE MIKE, WE ARE GOING TO STAY 
-- 
>> MIKE, WE ARE GOING TO STAY 
WITH YOU. 
TELL US EXACTLY WHAT IS GOING 
ON. 
RESET THE SCENE IF YOU WILL. 
>> Reporter: AT 9:06 THE FIRST 
CALLS CAME IN FOR A SHOOTING 
HERE AT THIS RITE AID 
DISTRIBUTION CENTER . THAT'S ON 
SPESUTIA ROAD  IN HARFORD 
COUNTY ABOUT  10 MINUTES FROM 
THAT SHOOTING LAST YEAR. 
THEY ARE FAMILIAR WITH DEALING 
WITH THINGS LIKE THIS 
UNFORTUNATELY. 
THE ASSOCIATED PRESS FIRST 
REPORTED THERE WERE MULTIPLE 
FATALITIES AND THEN PROVIDED 
DETAILS THAT THERE WERE THREE 
PEOPLE DEAD CITING AN ANONYMOUS 
LAW ENFORCEMENT SOURCE. 
WE ARE STILL WAITING FOR 
OFFICIAL WORD FROM THE HARFORD 
COUNTY SHERIFF'S OFFICE.  
THEY ARE KEEPING PEOPLE BACK 
FROM THE ACTUAL BUSINESS PARK. 
HOWEVER, YOU CAN SEE THAT THEY 
HAVE A LARGE LAW ENFORCEMENT 
PRESENCE HERE INCLUDING FEDERAL 
AGENTS FROM THE ATF AND THE FBI 
WHO ARE HERE INVESTIGATING. 
JUST ABOUT 10 MINUTES AGO, WE 
SAW THE MEDEVAC TOUCHDOWN HERE. 
THAT WAS AFTER THEY EVACUATED 
SOME PEOPLE WHO WORK HERE ON 
THREE SCHOOL BUSES AND THEN 
MOMENTS AGO YOU SAW IT LIVE 
HERE ON WJZ WHEN LAW 
ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS CAME HERE 
INCLUDING A MILITARIZED 
VEHICLE. 
AND WHAT TYPICALLY HAPPENS, 
THEY HAVE TO GO INCH BY INCH IN 
THAT BUILDING AND MAKE SURE IT 
IS CLEAR AND THAT THE THREAT IS 
GONE. 
WE DON'T KNOW HOW MANY OTHER 
PEOPLE MAY HAVE BEEN INJURED. 
THAT AP REPORT SAYS THREE DEBT 
BUT WE DON'T KNOW THE EXTENT OF 
-- DEAD BUT WE DON'T KNOW THE 
EXTENT OF INJURIES. 
HOWEVER, WE DID SEE THEM TAKE 
AWAY A GRAY HONDA CIVIC THAT 
HAD CRIME TAPE AROUND IT. 
THAT WAS RIGHT BE FINE ME -- 
RIGHT BEHIND ME. THEY TOOK THAT 
AWAY ABOUT AN HOUR AGO. 
WE ALSO HAVE SEEN MULTIPLE LAW 
ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES STILL 
ARRIVING AT THE SCENE. 
THAT MEDEVAC HAS NOT YET -- AS 
FAR AS I HAVE BEEN ABLE TO 
HEAR, WE DID NOT SEE THAT 
MEDEVAC CHOPPER TAKE BACK OFF. 
WE KNOW THAT A NUMBER OF PEOPLE 
ARE BEING TREATED AT TRAUMA 
CENTERS IN THE AREA INCLUDING 
AT JOHN HOPKINS BAYVIEW. 
THEY ARE GOING TO HOLD A PRESS 
CONFERENCE AROUND 12:30. 
WE HOPE TO GET MORE DETAILS 
ABOUT THAT. 
THERE ARE NUMBER OF TRAUMA 
CENTERS IN THE AREA FROM 
BALTIMORE TO DELAWARE. 
WE ARE STILL WAITING ON A 
NUMBER OF INJURED AND PERHAPS 
SOME BASIC DETAILS ABOUT THE 
SEVERITY OF THOSE INJURIES AND 
A LOT OF PEOPLE HERE -- SOME 
PEOPLE ARE NOT ABLE TO GET TO 
WHERE THEY LIVE. 
THEY ARE CONCERNED. 
WE TALKED TO ONE WOMAN WHO SAID 
HOW CHAOTIC IT WAS, IT SEEMED 
LIKE ALL BROKE LOOSE -- LIKE ALL
-- BROKE LOOSE. 
ONE OF THE OFFICERS HAS A LARGE 
WEAPON AND IS WALKING OUT OF 
THE SCENE HERE, JUST ACROSS THE 
STREET FROM THIS BUSINESS PARK. 
WE ARE SEEING WHAT LOOKS LIKE A 
LITTLE BIT MORE ACTIVITY AND 
THE NUMBER OF AGENTS ARE ON THE 
SCENE. 
I WOULD SAY AT LEAST THREE 
DOZEN ARE HERE. 
AND THIS IS SPESUTIA ROAD , 
THIS IS THE ENTRANCE TO THE 
BUSINESS PARK. 
THE HARFORD COUNTY SHERIFF'S 
OFFICE  IS HAVING A PRESS 
CONFERENCE IN MINUTES. 
>> SORRY TO INTERRUPT YOU. IT 
DOES LOOK LIKE THEY ARE 
BEGINNING TO CONVENE FOR SOME 
SORT OF OFFICIAL NEWS CONFERENCE
. SADLY, WE HAVE A NEW 
VOCABULARY. 
ONE OF THEM IS FLUID. 
THE SITUATION IS FLUID. 
THE SITUATION HERE IS FLUID. 
PEOPLE LIVE IN THE VICINITY OF 
THIS INDUSTRIAL PARK ARE BEING 
URGED TO NOT COME IN THE AREA. 
STAY OUT OF THE AREA. 
I KNOW YOUR FIRST INSTINCT IF 
YOU KNOW SOMEONE WHO WORKS 
THERE IS TO GO THERE BUT THE 
BEST THING TO DO WOULD BE RIGHT 
NOW TO STAY WHERE YOU ARE AND 
TO CONTINUE TO LISTEN TO NEWS 
SOURCES AND WAIT FOR WORD. WE 
HOPE TO GET YOU THAT KIND OF 
INFORMATION IN A FEW MOMENTS 
WHEN WE'RE SUPPOSED TO HAVE A 
NEWS CONFERENCE. 
>> HARFORD COUNTY  SHERIFF ALSO 
REMINDING YOU TO LISTEN TO THEM 
FOR OFFICIAL INFORMATION. 
WE'RE TRYING TO DETERMINE WHERE 
THE LOCATION WILL BE. WE SAW 
SEVERAL SCHOOL BUSES TAKING 
EMPLOYEES OUT OF THE BUILDING. 
THERE ARE AT LEAST 1000 
EMPLOYEES THAT WORK AT THAT 
FACILITY. 
IT IS INCREDIBLY LARGE. 
CHOPPER 13 IS OVERHEAD. 
IT IS DIFFICULT FOR THEM TO GET 
CLOSE BECAUSE THOSE MEDEVAC 
HELICOPTERS WERE STILL LANDING 
AT THAT LOCATION. 
MIKE ALSO MENTIONED THAT SOME 
OF THE VICTIMS ARE BEING TAKEN 
TO DELAWARE HOSPITALS, MARYLAND 
HOSPITALS, AND THE BAYVIEW 
LOCATION AS WELL AS -- 
>> TRAUM CENTERS. 
>> THE CLOSEST WOULD BE SHOCK 
TRAUMA, OF COURSE. 
CHRISTIANA ALSO HAS A GOOD 
TRAUMA CENTER AS WELL. 
THERE IS A LOT OF INFORMATION 
THAT IS STILL FLOATING AROUND 
THERE. 
ESPECIALLY REGARDING THE 
SUSPECT. 
WE DON'T WANT TO REPORT 
INCORRECT INFORMATION. 
IT IS UNCLEAR IF THAT SUSPECT 
IS INFECTING CUSTODY. 
THE SHOOTING SITUATION -- IN 
FACT IN CUSTODY. THE SHOOTING 
SITUATION -- 
>> I WOULD TRUST YOUR LOCAL 
MEDIA. 
A LOT OF NATIONAL REPEATED -- 
MEDIA IS REPORTING INFORMATION 
THAT IS NOT CORRECT. 
THE BEST INFORMATION IS FROM 
LAW ENFORCEMENT. 
THAT WILL BE THE REAL 
INFORMATION. 
UNFORTUNATELY, WE DO HAVE TO 
SAY IT SEEMS TO BE CLEAR AT 
THIS POINT THAT THERE ARE 
FATALITIES. 
THE NUMBER WE HAVE RIGHT NOW IS 
THREE. 
THERE WERE ALSO MULTIPLE 
INJURIES. 
>> DENISE, WE'VE BEEN TALKING 
ABOUT THIS. 
THIS SEEMS ODDLY FAMILIAR. 
11 MONTHS AGO WE ALSO HAD THIS 
VERY SIMILAR SHOT OVER EDGEWOOD.
THAT WASN'T EVEN A YEAR AGO. 
THAT WAS WHEN THREE EMPLOYEES 
WERE SHOT AND THEN WENT UP 95 
AND THERE WAS ANOTHER SHOOTING 
IN DELAWARE AS WELL. 
THERE WAS ALSO THE PENURY -- AN 
ERA SHOOTING. 
THIS ONE IS AT THE RITE AID 
DISTRIBUTION CENTER.  
SINCE MARCH, A SHOOTING AT 
GREAT MILLS HIGH SCHOOL AND 
ALSO THE CAPITAL GAZETTE. IT IS 
DESERVING -- DISTURBING TO 
COVER THESE. 
THE MEDEVAC HELICOPTER IS NOW 
LEAVING. 
WHERE IT IS HEADING, IS UNCLEAR 
TO US. 
WE ARE STILL WAITING FOR THAT 
INFORMATION. 
THE PRESS CONFERENCE WAS 
SUPPOSED TO START TWO MINUTES 
AGO BUT WE KNOW HOW THAT GOES. 
>> WE ARE MAKING ASSUMPTIONS 
BUT I'M MAKING THE ASSUMPTION 
IF THE MEDEVAC JUST LANDED IN 
IS TAKING OFF NOW TWO AND HALF 
HOURS AFTER THE EVENT INITIALLY 
TOOK PLACE EITHER THEY ARE 
DISCOVERING MORE PEOPLE WHO 
WERE INJURED OR SOMETHING HAS 
DEVELOPED, SOMETHING DRAMATIC 
HAS DEVELOPED. 
>> DENISE, WE ARE GETTING THIS 
TOO FROM THE RITE AID. SUSAN 
HENDERSON IS WITH WRITING. 
SHE SAYS THIS HAPPENED AT THE 
SUPPORT -- RITE AID. 
SHE SAYS THIS IS HAPPENED AT 
THE SUPPORT CENTER. 
EXPORT -- A SUPPORT FACILITY 
ADJACENT TO A LARGER BUILDING. 
THAT IS QUITE BIG. 
>> INITIALLY, THE WORD WENT OUT 
THAT IT WAS A WORKPLACE 
SHOOTING. 
THAT CAN MEAN ANYTHING. 
A CODE BECASE -- IT COULD BE A 
ROBBERY, IT COULD BE A DISPUTE. 
WE JUST DON'T KNOW. 
THE MOST IMPORTANT QUESTION IS 
WHO ARE THESE VICTIMS SO THAT 
FAMILIES CAN REST EASY. 
WHO IS JUST FINE? 
WHO HAS BEEN EVACUATED AND IS 
JUST FINE? 
THOSE ARE THE MOST IMPORTANT 
QUESTIONS WE HOPE TO GET 
ANSWERS TO IN THE NEXT 10 TO 15 
MINUTES FROM LAW ENFORCEMENT 
WHO SAID THEY ARE GOING TO HAVE 
A NEWS CONFERENCE AT 11:45. 
>> ONE OF THE THINGS TOO, WE 
HEARD FROM NICOLE IF YOU 
MINUTES AGO SING PEOPLE WERE 
CHECKING IN ON FACEBOOK SAYING 
THEY ARE OKAY. 
WE ARE BEING TOLD IT IS STILL 
ON LOCKDOWN. 
PARTS ARE STILL BEING HELD ON 
LOCKDOWN AS EMPLOYEES ARE BEING 
TAKEN OUT. 
HE WORKS THERE FOR -- A DECADE 
AND KNOWS SOME OF THE PEOPLE. 
PEOPLE ARE STILL CHECKING IN TO 
LET LOVED ONES KNOW THEY ARE 
OKAY. 
WE STILL DON'T HAVE WORD ON 
THAT FAMILY REUNIFICATION 
CENTER. 
WE ARE TOLD WITHIN THE NEXT 
FIVE MINUTES THAT MEDIA 
BRIEFING WILL BE UNDERWAY. 
RICK RITTER IS STANDING BY. 
THIS HAS BECOME TOO FAMILIAR 
FOR THEM COVERING THESE 
WORKPLACE SHOOTINGS. 
DENISE, A GOOD POINT, SOMETIMES 
THESE ARE DOMESTIC SITUATIONS. 
AND UNFORTUNATELY IT OCCURS AT 
A WORKPLACE. 
IN OTHER SITUATIONS IT IS A 
DISGRUNTLED EMPLOYEE AS WE ARE 
AWARE. 
>> ANYTHING, ANYTHING, THIS CAN 
BE ANYTHING. 
IT'S A DRUG DISTRIBUTION 
CENTER. 
COULD HAVE BEEN A ROBBERY. 
WE LITERALLY KNOW NOTHING THAT 
WE COULD GIVE YOU. 
NO INFORMATION THAT IS 
VERIFIABLE EXCEPT FOR SETTLING 
THREE PEOPLE OF LOST THEIR 
LIVES THIS MORNING. 
THAT IS NOT INCLUDING A SUSPECT 
IS WHAT WE ARE TOLD. 
THOSE ARE THREE VICTIMS. 
>> LET'S GO BACK TO MIKE NOW 
WITH MORE. 
MIKE, THAT HELICOPTER HAS TAKEN 
OFF AGAIN. 
IT SOUNDS LIKE IT IS BEHIND 
YOU? 
>> Reporter: IT DID. 
IT DID. 
LITERALLY LIKE A MINUTES AGO IT 
WENT UP OVER THOSE TREES AND 
FLEW OVER THAT WAY. 
IT FIRST LANDED HERE ROUGHLY 10 
TO 15 MINUTES AGO. 
THERE WERE SEVERAL EMPTY 
HARFORD COUNTY  SCHOOL BUSES 
THAT WERE BROUGHT IN AND ABOUT 
A HALF HOUR LATER, WE SAW THOSE 
BUSES FILLED WITH PEOPLE 
LEAVING THE BUSINESS PARK WITH 
A NUMBER OF LAW ENFORCEMENT 
MEMBERS. 
THEN WE SAW THE MEDEVAC CHOPPER 
LAND HERE AT A LARGE BUILDING 
RIGHT HERE AT THE BUSINESS PARK,
THOMAS ACROSS THE STREET FROM 
WHERE I AM. 
AND THEN IT WAS PROBABLY 10 -- 
THERE WAS A MILITARIZED VEHICLE 
AND A LARGE LINE OF LAW 
ENFORCEMENT THAT CAME IN TO THE 
BUSINESS PARK, TO THE SCENE, 
AND THEN WE SAW THAT MEDEVAC 
CHOPPER TAKE OFF. 
NOW WE ARE SEEING A NUMBER OF 
LAW ENFORCEMENT VEHICLES LEAVING
AFTER THAT CHOPPER TOOK OFF. 
AND AS WE MENTIONED FROM THE 
ASSOCIATED PRESS, WE HEARD FROM 
A RITE AID SPOKESPERSON THAT 
THE SHOOTING HAPPENED AT A 
SUPPORT FACILITY ADJACENT TO A 
LARGER BUILDING HERE. 
A SUPPORT FACILITY ADJACENT TO 
A LARGER BUILDING HERE AT THE 
SCENE. 
SO, WE ARE THINKING THAT 
PERHAPS THERE WERE STILL SOME 
INJURED IN THERE AND SO THEY 
WANTED TO CLEAR OUT AS MANY 
CIVILIANS AS THEY COULD AND 
BROUGHT IN THAT MEDEVAC CHOPPER 
AND BROUGHT IN MORE LAW 
ENFORCEMENT SUPPORT AND THAT 
THAT CHOPPER LEFT THE SCENE. 
AS WE WERE TELLING YOU EARLIER, 
HERE IN HARFORD COUNTY  THEY 
HAVE TRAINED PARAMEDICS TO COME 
IN AND DEAL WITH THESE MASS 
SHOOTINGS SO THAT IT CAN BE A 
DANGEROUS, ACTIVE, FLUID 
SITUATION. 
THEY HAVE TRAINED THEM TO BE 
ABLE TO WORK AROUND THAT AND BE 
ABLE TO PROTECT THEIR OWN LIVES 
WHILE TRYING TO SAVE PEOPLE. 
SO THAT SOMEBODY DOESN'T BLEED 
TO DEATH OR DOESN'T GET -- 
ISN'T STUCK WHILE THEY'RE 
WAITING FOR PLEASE TO CLEAR THE 
BUILDING. 
SOMETIMES -- POLICE TO CLEAR 
THE BUILDING. 
SOMETIMES THEY WILL BRING IN 
RESPONDERS TO VICTIMS IN SAFE 
LOCATIONS. 
AND THAT HAS SAVED LIVES. 
WE SAW THEY DID THAT IN THE 
SHOOTING THAT HAPPENED LAST 
YEAR WITH THE MAN WHO WENT ON 
THE RUN AND DROVE TO DELAWARE 
AND SHOT SOMEONE THERE. 
HE IS STILL GOING ON TRIAL. 
HIS TRIAL IN DELAWARE IS OVER. 
THEY ALREADY HAD THAT TRAINING. 
UNFORTUNATELY, THEY ARE WELL 
VERSED IN THAT. 
AGAIN, THAT CHOPPER JUST LEFT 
HERE. 
WE KNOW THERE ARE MULTIPLE 
INJURED AS WELL WHO WERE TAKEN 
TO CHRISTIANA AND JOHNS HOPKINS 
BAYVIEW AND WE'RE EXPECTING TO 
HEAR MORE FROM BAYVIEW LATER ON 
TODAY. 
>> A QUICK QUESTION. 
ARE YOU HEARING ANYTHING? 
WE ARE GETTING WORD THAT THEY 
ARE TELLING PEOPLE TO GO TO -- 
GRACE. BUT I'M TRYING TO GET 
CONFIRMATION ON THAT. 
>> Reporter: THAT MAY BE TRUE. 
HOWEVER, THE HARFORD COUNTY 
SHERIFF'S OFFICE JUST SAID THEY 
WERE A FEW MINUTES DELAYED  BUT 
THEY ARE GOING TO GET THE 
BRIEFING UNDERWAY. 
I'M THINKING THEY WILL PROVIDE 
MORE INFORMATION ABOUT THAT. 
ALL WE KNOW FROM THE SCENE 
RIGHT HERE IS THAT THEY 
EVACUATED PEOPLE OUT. THEY 
BROUGHT THE MEDEVAC IN AND THEY 
HAVE A LARGE POLICE PRESENCE 
HERE. 
THERE ARE A LOT OF ATF AGENTS 
WHO ARE ARMED WITH VESTS. 
WE SAW ACTIVITY JUST A FEW 
MOMENTS AGO. 
AND WE STILL SEE A NUMBER OF 
POLICE OFFICERS STANDING BY 
HERE ON SPESUTIA ROAD . AND 
FROM WHAT THE RITE AID IS 
SAYING, THE SHOOTING HAPPENED 
AT A SUPPORT FACILITY THAT IS 
NEXT TO A LARGER BUILDING. 
THEY HAVE TO GO THROUGH HERE 
AND MAKE SURE THAT THEY COVER 
EVERY SQUARE FOOT OF THIS SO 
THAT IF THERE IS ANY RISK OR 
DANGER HERE, THAT THIS IS SAFE 
FOR PEOPLE. 
SO THIS IS STILL A DEVELOPING 
SITUATION HERE. POLICE HAVE NOT 
STOOD DOWN YET. 
YOU CAN SEE FROM THESE PICTURES 
JUST HOW MANY LAW ENFORCEMENT 
OFFICERS ARE HERE. THE NUMBER 
HAS JUST KEPT GROWING SINCE 
THIS WAS FIRST REPORTED A FEW 
MINUTES AFTER 9:00 THIS MORNING.
>> IT'S IRONIC IN A TERRIBLE 
WAY THAT THIS WOULD HAPPEN 
AGAIN IN HARFORD COUNTY.  
GENERALLY HARFORD COUNTY IS A 
SAFE COUNTY.  
THEY LOST 2:A BEAST -- LOST TWO 
DEPUTIES. 
THAT WAS THE FIRST DEPUTIES 
THEY HAD LOST IN DECADES. 
THESE SHOOTINGS CONTINUE TO 
HAPPEN. 
>> IT WAS JUST 11 MONTHS AGO 
THAT HE SHOT -- 
>> IT WAS OCTOBER. 
>> IT'S INTERESTING THAT YOU 
SAY THAT THE CAPITAL GAZETTE IS 
FOLLOWING THIS AS WELL. 
THEY JUST LOST THEIR OWN 
EMPLOYEES IN A WORKPLACE 
SHOOTING. THIS IS HAPPENED 
THREE TIMES HERE IN MARYLAND. 
THIS IS THE THIRD ONE SINCE 
MARCH. 
WE HAD GREAT MILLS HIGH SCHOOL, 
THE CAPITAL GAZETTE, AND OF 
COURSE AN ERA, AND EDGEWOOD 
LAST YEAR -- PANERA BREAD, AND 
EDWARD -- EDGEWOOD LAST YEAR. 
IT IS DCC VU UP HERE. 
A SUSPECT, CASUALTIES, PEOPLE 
BEING TAKEN TO HOSPITALS, IT'S 
SO DISTURBING TO CONTINUE 
FOLLOWING THIS. 
>> YES. 
IT'S DISTURBING. 
KIMBERLY HAS ARRIVED AT THE 
SCENE. 
I KNOW ARE TWEETING A COUPLE OF 
HOURS AGO. 
HE SAW THE RESPONSE AT THE 
SCENE. 
WHERE ARE YOU LOCATED NOW AND 
WHAT HAVE YOU SEEN? 
>> Reporter: WE ARE PUSHED BACK 
FROM THE SCENE. 
WE ARE ON OLD PHILADELPHIA ROAN.
WE ARE WAITING FOR THE PRESS 
CONFERENCE TO BEGIN. 
-- ROAD. 
WE ARE WAITING FOR THE PRESS 
CONFERENCE TO BEGIN. 
WE ARE WAITING ON A PRESS 
CONFERENCE TO BEGIN ANY MINUTE 
NOW. 
THIS WILL LIKELY BE THE FIRST 
OF MANY PRESS CONFERENCES TODAY.
LAW ENFORCEMENT IS GENERALLY 
GOOD ABOUT GIVING US ANY 
INFORMATION THEY CAN WHEN THEY 
CAN. 
WE EXPECT THAT THESE 
CONFERENCES COULD BE STAGGERED 
THROUGHOUT THE DAY AS THE 
SITUATION UNFOLDS. 
YOU KEEP REFERRING TO THIS AS A 
FLUID SITUATION. 
IT IS AN ACTIVE SHOOTER 
SITUATION. 
THAT IS NOT THE CASE FROM WHAT 
WE ARE TOLD BUT IT IS A FLUID 
SITUATION IN THE ASPECT THAT 
THIS INVESTIGATION IS REALLY 
JUST BEGINNING. 
WE FIRST HEARD REPORTS OF A 
ACTIVE SHOOTER AROUND 9:00 THIS 
MORNING. 
THIS IS LESS THAN THREE HOURS 
INTO THE INVESTIGATION. 
THIS HAS BECOME A MULTI-AGENCY 
EFFORT SO THAT INFORMATION WILL 
HAVE TO BE CORRELATED BETWEEN 
VARIOUS LAW ENFORCEMENT 
AGENCIES AND OF COURSE, THEY 
WANT TO MAKE SURE THEY GET THIS 
RIGHT. 
THEY HAVE ALREADY BEEN 
CAUTIONING TO MAKE SURE THAT 
YOU ARE GETTING YOUR NEWS FROM 
A CREDIBLE SOURCE. 
THEY ARE PROMISING AN OFFICIAL 
UPDATE ANY MOMENT. 
AS SOON AS WE CAN BRING THAT, 
WE WILL. 
A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE CLOSELY 
WATCHING THE SITUATION. 
>> I WANT TO INTERJECT. 
IT SEEMED TO IMPLY THAT IT IS 
NO LONGER AN ACTIVE SHOOTER 
SCENE? 
IS THAT CORRECT? 
>> Reporter: THOSE OF THE 
REPEATS WE HAVE -- REPORTS WE 
HAVE SEEN ON TWITTER. 
AGAIN, THEY ARE STILL UNSEEN. 
THOSE SOME -- ARE SOME OF THE 
REPORTS THAT WE ARE SEEING. 
THIS IS A VERY NEW 
INVESTIGATION. 
WE ARE WAITING ON AUTHORITIES 
TO UPDATE US. 
>> AND THOSE REPORTS ON 
TWITTER, ARE THOSE FROM RELIABLE
SOURCES? 
BECAUSE I'M HAPPY TO HEAR IT IF 
IT IS CORRECT. 
I WANT TO KNOW IF IT IS NO 
LONGER AN ACTIVE SCENE. 
>> Reporter: DENISE, I WILL WORK
TO CLARIFY THAT IN A FEW 
MINUTES. 
>> GOOD. 
I HOPE THAT'S CORRECT. 
>> KIMBERLY, THANK YOU SO MUCH. 
IF YOU ARE JUST JOINING US AND 
TUNING IN FOR WJZ NEWS AT NOON, 
WE ARE FOLLOWING BREAKING NEWS 
IN HARFORD COUNTY  WHERE WE 
HAVE CONFIRMED THAT THREE 
PEOPLE HAVE BEEN KILLED. 
>>> LIVE FROM TELEVISION HILL, 
THIS IS WJZ BREAKING NEWS. 
>> WELCOME BACK. WE HAVE BEEN 
ON THE SCENE ALL MORNING. 
WE ARE WAITING FOR A PRESS 
CONFERENCE FROM HARFORD COUNTY  
SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT AFTER 
THREE PEOPLE WERE KILLED AND 
SEVERAL MORE INJURED IN A 
WORKPLACE SHOOTING AT THE RITE 
AID DISTRIBUTION CENTER  IN 
HARFORD COUNTY. 
>> WE SAY WORKPLACE SHOOTING 
BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT HAPPENED.  
WE DON'T HAVE ANY IDEA IN TERMS 
OF MOTIVATION, ETC. 
THE ONLY INFORMATION WE CAN 
TELL YOU IS THAT THREE PEOPLE 
HAVE BEEN KILLED. THERE ARE 
OTHERS WHO OPEN INJURED. 
WE DON'T HAVE EXACT NUMBERS. 
IT WAS INITIALLY DESCRIBED AS 
MULTIPLE. 
BUT THAT'S ALL WE KNOW. 
>> WE ARE GOING TO GO LIVE OUT 
TO MIKE. 
MIKE. 
>> Reporter: WE ARE HERE AT 
SPESUTIA ROAD.  
RITE AID IS SAYING THIS 
OCCURRED AT A SUPPORT YIELDING
THAT IS NEXT TO A LARGER 
BUILDING HERE. 
WE HAVE SEEN A LARGE AND 
CONTINUING POLICE PRESENCE HERE.
WE ARE STILL WAITING TO HEAR 
FROM THE SHERIFF'S OFFICE. 
MULTIPLE ARE INJURED AND THEY 
HAVE BEEN TAKEN TO TRAUMA 
CENTERS IN THE AREA. 
WE HAVE SEEN ATF, FBI, FEDERAL 
AGENTS ON THE SCENE TRYING TO 
ASSIST IN HELPING FIND OUT WHAT 
EXACTLY HAPPENED. 
WE SAW THE CHOPPER LAND AND 
THEN TAKE OFF AGAIN. 
AND WE SAW SEVERAL MILITARY 
VEHICLES ARRIVING AT THE SCENE 
AT THIS DISTRIBUTION CENTER. 
THE FIRST CALLS CAME IN AT 9:06.
>> ALL RIGHT, WE HAVE BEEN 
WATCHING THE STORY UNFOLDING. 
SHOOTING JUST NORTHEAST OF 
BALTIMORE. IT LOOKS LIKE POLICE 
ARE GETTING READY TO UPDATE US 
WITH THE PRESS CONFERENCE. 
LET'S LISTEN. 
>> THIS IS STILL A VERY FLUID 
INVESTIGATION. 
WATCHING THE REPORTS, THERE IS 
A LOT OF MISS INFORMATION. 
-- MISINFORMATION. 
I URGE YOU TO FOLLOW THE 
SHERIFFS OFFICE ON TWITTER. 
WE WILL CONTINUE TO UPDATE YOU 
THROUGHOUT THE DAY. 
WILL NOT TAKE ANY QUESTIONS. 
AFTER THE STATEMENTS, I WILL 
LET YOU KNOW WHEN THE NEXT 
BRIEFING WILL BE. 
THANK YOU. 
>> ANOTHER TRAGIC EVENT FOR US 
THIS MORNING IN HARFORD COUNTY. 
I WANT TO THANK  EVERYBODY FOR 
PATIENTS. 
UNFORTUNATELY, WE HAVE BEEN 
STANDING HERE BEFORE. 
WE STAND HERE AGAIN TODAY. 
MANY PEOPLE HAVE BEEN AFFECTED 
BY THE EVENTS THIS MORNING. 
OUR PRAYERS AND THOUGHTS TO THE 
PEOPLE AFFECTED. 
WE ARE SO PRELIMINARY INTO THE 
INVESTIGATION. 
THERE ARE 1 MILLION QUESTIONS. 
WE ARE NOT GOING TO TAKE ANY 
QUESTIONS TODAY. 
AS KRISTI SAID, IT IS IMPORTANT 
THAT WE DEAL WITH FAX. 
THERE ARE FAMILIES THAT ARE 
HARMED FROM TODAY'S EVENT. 
WE DON'T WANT TO MAKE IT ANY 
WORSE. 
WE DON'T WANT TO BE PART OF 
THAT. 
PLEASE ALLOW US THE TIME TO 
GATHER FACTS AND SHOW THOSE 
WITH YOU. 
I'M GOING TO GIVE YOU AS MUCH 
INFORMATION AS WE CAN RIGHT 
NOW. 
IT IS VERY PRELIMINARY AND 
LIMITED. 
AT ABOUT 9:06 THIS MORNING, A 
REPORT CAME INTO THE DISPATCH 
CENTER FROM THE RITE AID 
úDISTR 
FIRED.  
IMMEDIATELY DEPUTIES AND 
OFFICERS AND TROOPERS AND OTHER 
FIRST RESPONDERS RESPONDED. WE 
WERE UNSEATED IN JUST OVER FIVE 
MINUTES. 
UNITS QUICKLY PAIRED UP TOGETHER
AND GOT INTO THE BUILDING TO 
RENDER FIRST AID WERE 
APPROPRIATE. 
AND WE ATTEMPTED TO LOCATE A 
SUSPECT OR SUSPECTS. 
AT THIS TIME I CAN CONFIRM 
MULTIPLE WOUNDED AND MULTIPLE 
FATALITIES. 
BASED ON WHAT WE KNOW RIGHT 
NOW, AND AGAIN THIS IS 
PRELIMINARY, THE LOAN SUSPECT 
IS IN CUSTODY AND IS IN 
CRITICAL CONDITION AT A LOCAL 
HOSPITAL. 
IT APPEARS TO BE A SINGLE 
WEAPON THAT WAS USED, A HANDGUN
. THERE WERE NO SHOTS FIRED BY 
ANY OF THE LAW ENFORCEMENT 
OFFICERS RESPONDING. 
WE DO NOT BELIEVE THERE IS AN 
ADDITIONAL THREAT ANYWHERE TO 
THE HARFORD COUNTY COMMUNITY.  
WE HAVE SET UP A FAMILY 
REUNIFICATION CENTER. 
AGAIN, THIS IS VERY EARLY. 
THE OFFICE WILL BE HAPPY TO GIVE
YOU MORE INFORMATION AS IT 
BECOMES AVAILABLE. 
AGAIN, KEEP THE VICTIM S IN 
YOUR THOUGHTS AND PRAYERS. 
WE ALSO HAVE TO THANK FELLOW 
FIRST RESPONDERS. 
WE HAVE RESPONDERS FROM THE 
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. 
THE FBI, ATF, STATE POLICE, 
NATURAL RESOURCES, THE LOCAL 
DEPARTMENTS, YOU NAME IT, AS WE 
HAVE SEEN IN THE COMMUNITY 
BEFORE, WHEN SOMETHING LIKE 
THIS HAPPENS, YOU CAN'T HAVE 
ENOUGH POLICE AND YOU CAN'T 
HAVE THEM FAST ENOUGH. 
WE ARE FORTUNATE THAT EVERYBODY 
WORKS SO WELL TOGETHER. 
WE WERE ON SCENE AND ABLE TO 
GET AS MUCH AID AS QUICKLY AS 
POSSIBLE. 
THAT'S WHAT WE HAVE AT THIS 
POINT. 
KRISTI WILL PUT IT OUT LATER 
WHEN WE HAVE ADDITIONAL 
DETAILS. 
I KNOW YOU ARE ANXIOUS. 
WE WILL BE AS TIMELY AS WE CAN. 
SERVE. 
-- SIR. 
>> BARRY GLASSMAN, I JUST GOT 
OFF THE PHONE WITH THE GOVERNOR 
A FEW MOMENTS AGO. 
I UPDATED THE GOVERNOR ON THE 
INCIDENT SO FAR AS WE KNOW IT. 
HE OFFERED ALL OF HIS RESOURCES 
AVAILABLE UNDER STATE 
GOVERNMENT. 
WE CERTAINLY APPRECIATE THAT. 
ALL THE ALLIED AGENCIES THAT 
RESPONDED -- I FOLLOWED THIS 
FROM THE MOMENT THE CALL CAME 
ON THE DISPATCH AND LISTENED TO 
THE RADIO TRANSMISSIONS. 
UNFORTUNATELY, TODAY WE HAVE 
ACTIVE SHOOTER DRILLING AND 
DRILLS AND I CAN TELL YOU AND 
TELL CITIZENS THAT EVERY AGENCY 
PERFORMED AT THE TOP OF THEIR 
PROFESSION. 
AND THE RESPONSE FROM ALL THE 
ALLIED AGENCIES WAS GREAT. 
WE RESPONDED WITH MEDICAL UNITS
. I AM THANKFUL TO ALL THE 
AGENCIES THAT CAME OUT TO HELP 
US TODAY TO GET THROUGH THIS 
WHICH IS BECOMING A TOO OFTEN 
OCCURRENCE NOT ONLY IN HARFORD 
COUNTY BUT IN THE COUNTRY.  
WE REALLY REACH OUT TO THOSE 
FAMILIES THAT ARE SUFFERING 
RIGHT NOW THAT I'VE LOST LOVED 
ONES. 
AND OFFER SERVICES AS WE BEGIN 
TO GET THEM REUNIFIED NOT ONLY 
WITH LOVED ONES BUT WITH 
WORKERS THAT HAVE BEEN 
DISPLACED. 
I CERTAINLY THINK ALL OF THE 
COURAGEOUS -- THANK ALL OF THE 
COURAGEOUS MEN AND WOMEN WHO 
HAVE HELPED US. 
>> ARE YOU SUGGESTING THAT THE 
SUSPECT SHOT IS -- HIS OR 
HERSELF? 
>> WE ARE NOT GIVING ADDITIONAL 
INFORMATION. 
THIS IS VERY FLUID. 
WE WILL PROVIDE YOU THE 
INFORMATION AS SOON AS WE HAVE 
IT. 
FOLLOW THE FEEDS. 
I WILL LET YOU KNOW WHEN THE 
NEXT BRIEFING WILL BE TODAY. 
THANK YOU. 
>> THANK YOU. 
>> SO WE HAVE THE LATEST 
INFORMATION ABOUT THE SHOOTING. 
IT STARTED ABOUT 9:00 THIS 
MORNING. 
WE KNOW NOW THAT THE OFFICERS 
SAY IT HAPPENED AT THE RITE AID 
DISTRIBUTION CENTER  IN THIS 
INDUSTRIAL PARK AREA. OFFICERS 
WERE CALLED AND GOT TO THE 
SCENE WITHIN FIVE MINUTES. 
IMMEDIATELY THEY STARTED 
WORKING ON PEOPLE THAT THEY 
SOUGHT THAT WERE WOUNDED. 
THE REPORTING IS THAT THIS 
PRESS CONFERENCE HAS NOT 
CONFIRMED IT BUT THREE PEOPLE 
WERE KILLED. 
MULTIPLE PEOPLE WERE WOUNDED 
AND THE SUSPECT IS IN CRITICAL 
CONDITION IN THE HOSPITAL. 
WHAT THEY SAID WAS THAT NO 
OFFICERS FIRED THEIR GUNS. SO 
WE DON'T KNOW IF THE SUSPECT IS 
IN MEDICAL CONDITION BECAUSE HE 
OR SHE SHOT THEM SELF OR IF 
SOMEONE ELSE HAD A GUN ON THE 
SCENE. 
ALL THEY ARE WILLING TO SAY IS 
THAT NO OFFICERS SHOT BUT THE 
SUSPECT IS IN CRITICAL 
CONDITION IN THE HOSPITAL. 
>> PAUL IS WITH THE SNOW AND 
JOINS US ON THE PHONE. 
PAUL, ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I 
THINK IS INTERESTING TO 
UNDERSTAND IS WHERE THIS 
HAPPENED IS AT A RITE AID 
DISTRIBUTION CENTER . IN A 
STATEMENT, THE RIGHT AID PEOPLE 
SAY THIS IS A LARGE FACILITY -- 
RIGHT AID -- PEOPLE SAY THIS IS 
A LARGE FACILITY. 
MY GUESS IS THAT THERE WOULD BE 
A LOT OF SECURITY. 
WHAT WOULD THE QUESTIONS YOU 
WOULD HAVE? 
>> I KNOW THERE HAS BEEN A LOT 
OF SPECULATION TO MALE OR 
FEMALE. 
I AM HEARING FEMALE. 
WAS THE PERSON AN EMPLOYEE? 
IF NOT, DID THE SHOOTER HAVE 
ANY KIND OF RELATION TO PEOPLE 
THAT WERE EMPLOYED AT THE 
DISTRIBUTION CENTER. 
WHEN WE START TO BREAK DOWN THE 
DEMOGRAPHIC THAT WE KNOW OF 
RIGHT NOW AND THE PEDIGREE THAT 
HAS BEEN PROVIDED, THIS LOOKS 
LIKE A WORKPLACE VIOLENCE 
RELATED INCIDENT OR DOMESTIC 
VIOLENCE. 
THAT IS GOING TO HAVE TO A LOT 
TO DO WITH THE RESPECT TO THE 
RELATIONSHIP. 
>> IF THIS IS A FEMALE SHOOTER, 
HOW RARE IS THAT? 
>> ANNE-MARIE,  UNFORTUNATELY, 
IT IS NOT AS WERE AS MOST 
PEOPLE THINK. 
OVER THE LAST 5 YEARS, WE HAVE 
SEEN A SIGNIFICANT MOVE OF THE 
NEEDLE AS IT RELATES TO FEMALES 
INVOLVED IN VIOLENT CASES. 
IT IS NOT AS RARE AS YOU THINK. 
CLEARLY THE MAJORITY BEING MEN, 
THERE IS NO DOUBT BUT IT IS NOT 
UNCOMMON TO SEE WOMEN. 
>> PAUL, BASED ON YOUR YEARS IN 
LAW ENFORCEMENT, -- AND I WAS 
REFERENCING THE DISTRIBUTION 
CENTER BECAUSE MY GUESS WOULD 
BE THAT THERE WOULD BE A GOOD 
LEVEL OF SECURITY AT A PLACE 
LIKE THIS. 
YOU POINTED OUT TO COULD BE 
WORKPLACE OR A DOMESTIC 
ALTERCATION, SOMEBODY WOULD 
HAVE TO BE TRUSTED TO BRING IN 
A WEAPON TO FACILITY LIKE THIS? 
UNLESS THERE PEOPLE THAT WALK 
AROUND WITH WEAPONS, MY GUESS 
IS THAT THEY CAME IN AND 
CONCEALED THAT WEAPON AND KNEW 
WHAT KIND OF LEVEL OF SECURITY 
WAS IN PLACE TO GET A WEAPON 
INTO A PLACE LIKE THIS. 
>> CHANCES ARE THAT YOU ARE 
CORRECT. 
ONE OF THE THINGS WE HAVE SEEN 
AND WE HAVE TALKED ABOUT THIS A 
NUMBER OF TIMES, IT IS NOT 
UNCOMMON FOR INDUSTRIAL PARKS 
SUCH AS THIS AND AREAS OUTSIDE 
OF MAJOR CITIES -- AND THIS IS 
OUTSIDE OF BALTIMORE, TO HAVE 
FAR LESS SECURITY THAN WHAT THE 
STANDARD WOULD CALL FOR. 
WHAT I MEAN BY THAT IS THAT IT 
WOULDN'T BE UNCOMMON IF WE WERE 
TO GO OUT THERE TO SEE THAT 
THEY HAD NO OUTER PERIMETER 
SECURITY AND THAT THEY HAD VERY 
LIMITED SECURITY INTO THE 
BUILDING. 
I DON'T KNOW WHAT IS THERE BUT 
I CAN TELL YOU IT WOULDN'T BE 
UNCOMMON IF WE FOUND OUT THAT 
WERE THE CASE. 
>> THIS COULD FALL INTO THE 
CATEGORY OF ONE OF THOSE SOFT 
TARGETS. 
IT IS A DISTRIBUTION CENTER. 
THEY ARE TRUCKS COMING IN AND 
OUT. 
THERE IS A LOT OF MOVEMENT. 
1000 PEOPLE RUNNING AROUND. 
IF YOU EVER WORKED IN SOMETHING 
LKE THIS -- BACK IN COLLEGE I 
WORKED IN A FACILITY SIMILAR TO 
THIS, COMING IN AND OUT IS NOT 
THAT HARD. 
THEIR DOORS BUT YOU CAN SEE 
WHERE THE TRUCKS ARE PARKED. 
THEIR WAYS TO GET IN AND OUT. 
I COULD SEE IF THIS PERSON 
WORKED THERE, HOW THEY COULD 
WALK IN WITHOUT BEING CHECKED. 
>> YOU ARE RIGHT, ANNE-MARIE 
GREEN . SOMEONE WITH NO COMINGS 
AND GOINGS AT THAT LOCATION -- 
IN DISTRIBUTION CENTERS THEY 
ARE SO LARGE THAT OFTENTIMES 
YOU HAVE PEOPLE WHO DON'T THINK 
ABOUT IT, LEAVING THE BACK DOOR 
OPEN SO PEOPLE CAN COME IN AND 
OUT TO SMOKE. 
PEOPLE WILL KNOW IF THEY CAN 
WALK IN AND OUT OF THOSE 
LOCATIONS AT THOSE POINTS OF 
ACCESS WITHOUT BEING DETECTED 
IF THERE WAS SECURITY. 
THERE ARE A NUMBER OF THINGS 
THAT HAVE TO BE EXAMINED. 
>> THIS WAS REFERENCED DURING A 
PRESS CONFERENCE. 
WHAT KIND OF STEPS ARE 
OFFICIALS ACROSS THIS COUNTRY 
DOING AS WE SEE INCREASING 
NUMBERS? WE HAVE ALWAYS HAD 
MASS SHOOTINGS GOING BACK TO 
THE UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS BUT WE 
HAVE SEEN INCREASING NUMBERS 
ACROSS THIS COUNTRY OVER THE 
LAST 10 OR 15 YEARS. 
YOU HEARD IT REFERENCED IN THE 
PRESS CONFERENCE WHERE THEY 
SAID THIS IS SOMETHING THEY 
TRAIN FOR. 
IS A STANDARD OPERATING 
PROCEDURE NOW ACROSS ALL POLICE 
DEPARTMENTS IN THIS COUNTRY 
THAT THEY TRAIN AND PREPARE FOR 
SOMETHING LIKE THIS? 
>> IT REALLY IS. 
IT REALLY IS. 
AND WHAT WE ARE SEEING IS THE 
USE OF TECHNOLOGY IN THE PUBLIC 
PRIVATE PARTNERSHIP. 
WHAT I MEAN, HYPOTHETICALLY IN 
THIS INDUSTRIAL PARK, THEY HAVE 
A SCHEMATIC OF THE BUILDING OR 
BUILDINGS. 
THEY SHARE THAT WITH LAW 
ENFORCEMENT AND S.W.A.T. 
TEAMS SO WHEN THEY ARE 
RESPONDING THEY CAN MORE 
EFFICIENTLY IDENTIFY WHERE THE 
SHOOTER IS AND WHERE TO GO AND 
HOW TO EVACUATE PEOPLE SAFELY. 
THIS IS SOMETHING THAT IS 
TRAINED FOR. 
THE USE OF TECHNOLOGY WITH 
RESPECT TO SHARING SCHEMATICS 
AS WELL AS THE INCORPORATION OF 
ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE THAT IS 
BEING SHARED ENABLES THEM TO 
HAVE EYES ON THE PROPERTY 
BEFORE THEY GET THERE. 
THESE ARE THINGS THAT MULTI-
JURISDICTIONS AND MULTI-
AGENCIES ARE WORKING TOGETHER ON
. YEARS AGO, IT WOULD JUST BE 
ONE AGENCY. 
NOW THEY ARE ALL WORKING 
TOGETHER AROUND THE COUNTRY. 
>> WE ARE SHOWING LIVE VIDEO OF 
THE SCENE RIGHT NOW. 
IT LOOKS LIKE IT IS PROBABLY 
THE FRONT DOOR OF THE FACILITY. 
THERE ARE A COUPLE OF LITTLE 
YELLOW MARKERS ON THE FLOOR. 
>> ISN'T THAT USUALLY FOR 
AMMUNITION? 
>> WHEN WE TALK ABOUT HOW WOULD 
THIS PERSON GET IN, MAYBE THEY 
WALKED IN THROUGH THE FRONT 
DOOR. úWHAT WE ARE ALSO SEEING, 
IS STILL -- DESPITE THE SCENE 
BEING SORT OF UNDER CONTROL, A 
LOT OF OFFICERS ARE WALKING 
THROUGH THE AREA. 
WHAT WOULD BE OCCURRING NOW 
THAT IT SEEMS LIKE THEY DO HAVE 
THE ONLY PERSON RESPONSIBLE FOR 
THIS, THE SHOOTER IN THE 
HOSPITAL, GRAVELY INJURED. 
WHAT ARE OFFICERS DOING NOW? 
>> THEY ARE LOOKING FOR ANY 
TYPE OF COLLATERAL EVIDENCE. 
REMEMBER, PART OF THIS,  ANNE-
MARIE,  WHILE YOU ARE SEEING 
THEM ON SCENE THERE ARE 
OFFICERS OFF-SITE THAT ARE 
LOOKING AT THE VIDEO FEEDS THAT 
THEY ARE GOING TO GET FROM THAT 
INDUSTRIAL PARK. 
THEY ARE FOLLOWING STEPS THAT 
THE SHOOTER MAY HAVE TAKEN AND 
THEN THEY ARE GOING TO STEP 
BACK AND CREATE A PERIMETER 
FROM THAT. 
SO THAT'S WHAT THEY ARE SEEING. 
THEY ARE LOOKING TO SEE IF 
THERE IS CLINICAL -- COLLATERAL 
EVIDENCE TO SEE IF THERE IS 
MORE INFORMATION THAN THEY ARE 
AWARE OF. 
>> PAUL, I THINK MOST AMERICANS 
CAN UNDERSTAND THE HISTORY OF 
WORKPLACE SHOOTINGS IN THIS 
COUNTRY AND WHY FROM TIME TO 
TIME PEOPLE HAVE CHOSEN TO 
CARRY OUT VIOLENCE AGAINST THEIR
COWORKERS OR AGAINST THE COMPANY
OR AN INSTITUTION BUT EXPLAINED 
THE EVIDENCE THAT EXISTS OUT 
THERE FROM LAW ENFORCEMENT, 
FROM THE FBI, AS TO WHY WHEN 
THERE IS A DOMESTIC VIOLENCE 
SITUATION THAT SOMEONE WOULD 
CHOOSE TO ATTACK A SPOUSE OR 
SOMEBODY THAT THEY HAVE HAD A 
RELATIONSHIP WITH AT THEIR 
PLACE OF BUSINESS AND NOT JUST 
AT THE HOME? 
>> THAT IS PROBABLY THE MOST -- 
QUESTION OF ALL. 
IT IS THE FASTEST-GROWING 
ASPECT IN THE UNITED STATES. 
AND IT HAS BEEN FOR THE LAST 
SEVEN STRAIGHT YEARS. 
THE REASON WHY IT IS SO 
DANGEROUS AT THE WORKPLACE AND 
WHY THE WORKPLACE IS CHOSEN, 
THE WORKPLACE REPRESENTS THAT 
ONE PORTION OF THAT DOMESTIC 
VIOLENCE BATTERERS LIFE THAT HE 
CAN'T CONTROL OR MAYBE SHE 
CAN'T CONTROL. 
REMEMBER IN DOMESTIC VIOLENCE 
SITUATIONS SO MUCH IS ABOUT 
CONTROLLING AND MANIPULATING 
AND MANEUVERING A LIFE AWAY 
FROM OTHERS. 
THE WORKPLACE IS A SAFE HAVEN 
TO THAT PERSON THAT IS BEING 
BATTERED. 
THAT'S WHY THE BATTERER, A 
PERSON THAT IS SEEKING TO 
CONTROL THAT INDIVIDUAL HAS TO 
DO THIS AT WORK. 
IT IS REALLY PUTTING A FLAG IN 
THE GROUND TO SAYING -- AND 
SAYING NOBODY IS GOING TO 
CONTROL THAT PERSON BUT ME. 
THAT'S WHERE THEY ARE GOING TO 
GO TO WORK. 
THEY ARE GOING TO PER -- PROOF 
THAT THIS PERSON CONTROLS THIS 
PERSON BUT ME. 
>> WE DON'T REALLY KNOW THE 
SITUATION. 
WE HAVE SEEN ENOUGH OF THESE 
SHOOTINGS AND OFTEN PEOPLE WHEN 
THEY CAN WALK IN SO EASILY HAVE 
A PERSONAL CONNECTION. 
BUT WE ARE STILL WAITING FOR 
THE DETAILS. 
>> PAUL, WE THANK YOU AS ALWAYS.
>> VLAD AND ANNE-MARIE, ALWAYS 
A PLEASURE. 
>> WE'RE GOING TO GO BACK TO  
WPG -- WJZ. 
THE STATION IS LIVE AT THE 
SCENE IN ABERDEEN, MARYLAND. 
LET'S TAKE YOU THERE. 
>> WE CAN'T SAY THAT ENOUGH, 
TWITTER IS LIKE A RUMOR LINE. 
YOU ONLY PAY ATTENTION TO 
RELIABLE TWEETS FROM RELIABLE 
SOURCES. 
>> AND THE SAME GOES FOR 
FACEBOOK. 
>> LET'S GO BACK TO RICK RIVER. 
THOUGHTS AND PRAYERS, THOUGHTS 
AND PRAYERS. 
RICK WAS LIVE AT A SCENE LESS 
THAN A YEAR AGO. 
IN THE NEXT FEW DAYS AS YOU 
SPOKE WITH SOME OF THE 
EMPLOYEES WHO WATCHED SOME OF 
THEIR COWORKERS GONE DOWN, IT 
HAS TO STOP. 
>> THERE IS NO OTHER WAY TO PUT 
IT. 
IT'S HORRIFIC AND A TRAGEDY AND 
NEEDS TO STOP. 
THIS IS THE THIRD MASS SHOOTING 
IN THE DISTRICT IN THE LAST 3 
YEARS. 
THE LAST ONE TAKING PLACE 
EXACTLY ABOUT 11 MONTHS AGO AT 
ADVANCED GRANITE SOLUTIONS. 
THIS TAKING PLACE AT THE RITE 
AID DISTRIBUTION CENTER WITH A 
LITTLE MORE THAN 1000 EMPLOYEES 
AND WE NOW KNOW THAT MULTIPLE  
PEOPLE WERE KILLED AND MULTIPLE 
PEOPLE WERE WOUNDED. 
WE KEEP TALKING ABOUT SOCIAL 
MEDIA. 
I'M STANDING BETWEEN MY LIFE 
SHOTS TRYING TO GO THROUGH THE 
POSTS. 
THIS IS THE HEARTBREAKING PART 
IS WATCHING LOVED ONES POST ON 
SOCIAL MEDIA AND TRYING TO GET 
IN CONTACT AND TRYING TO FIND 
OUT IF THEY ARE OKAY. 
ONE PERSON PUTTING OUT ANYBODY 
KNOW -- I'M NOT GOING TO SAY 
THE NAME -- LET US KNOW THAT 
SHE IS OKAY. 
ANOTHER PERSON SAYING MY MOM 
WAS IN THE WAREHOUSE. 
DOES ANYBODY HAVE ANY 
INFORMATION. 
A LOT OF PEOPLE WAITING TO SEE 
IF THEIR LOVED ONES ARE OKAY. 
IT IS OUR JOB TO SIT HERE AND 
REPORT BUT YOU KNOW IT IS HARD 
TO NOT BE A HUMAN TOO. 
KNOWING HOW DIFFICULT THIS IS 
FOR THESE FAMILIES AND THE 
ENTIRE COMMUNITY, FOR THE THIRD 
TIME IN 3 YEARS, IT'S HARD TO 
FATHOM TO SAY THE LEAST. 
>> IT IS, INDEED. 
THE PHONE NUMBER -- EXCUSE ME, 
WE DON'T HAVE ANY ANSWERS YET. 
THE PHONE NUMBER IS 410-838-
5800.  
IF YOU GET A TWEET FROM SOMEONE 
ASKING THAT, TELL THEM TO CALL 
THIS NUMBER, 410-838-5800.  
THAT IS THE OFFICIAL HOTLINE 
WHERE YOU WILL GET ANY 
INFORMATION THAT THE HARFORD 
COUNTY SHERIFFS DEPARTMENT HAS  
ON SOMEONE THAT YOU MAY KNOW BE 
WORRIED ABOUT. 
>> ALSO WE ARE GOING TO GO BACK 
LIVE TO MIKE. 
CHURCH CREEK ELEMENTARY WAS ON 
A MODIFIED LOCKDOWN OUT OF 
PRECAUTION. 
THIS IS AN INDUSTRIAL PARK AREA 
WHERE MIKE IS STANDING BY. 
UNFORTUNATELY, THERE ARE NOT 
MANY SCHOOLS IN THE AREA. 
THIS WAS SOLELY AS A 
PRECAUTION. 
MIKE. 
>> Reporter: I WANT TO GO 
THROUGH SOME OF THE TWEETS THAT 
THE HARFORD COUNTY  SHERIFFS 
OFFICE HAS SENT OUT TO RUN DOWN 
SOME OF THE MAIN POINTS. 
HE EXPRESSES HIS THOUGHTS AND 
PRAYERS. 
THEY ARE STILL IN THE 
PRELIMINARY STAGES OF THIS 
INVESTIGATION. 
WHEN SUSPECT IS IN CUSTODY. 
THE FIRST REPORT CAME OUT AT 
9:06 AT THE RITE AID 
DISTRIBUTION CENTER. 
THEY GOT YOUR WITHIN FIVE 
MINUTES.  
MULTIPLE PEOPLE ARE WOUNDED AND 
MULTIPLE FATALITIES. 
THEY HAVE NOT GIVEN A NUMBER. 
SOURCES ARE SAYING THERE ARE 
THREE PEOPLE DEAD. 
BUT AGAIN, HARFORD COUNTY  
SHERIFF IS SAYING MULTIPLE 
FATALITIES AND MULTIPLE WOUNDED.
THIS WAS A LOAN SUSPECT. 
THE SUSPECT IS IN CUSTODY IN 
CRITICAL CONDITION. 
WE DO NOT BELIEVE THERE IS A 
FURTHER THREAT TO THE 
COMMUNITY. 
THEY HAVE A FAMILY 
REUNIFICATION CENTER SET UP AT 
THE LEVEL VOLUNTEER FIRE HOUSE .
THEY ARE GOING TO RELEASE 
ADDITIONAL INFORMATION LATER 
TODAY. 
THEY THINK BACK PARTNERS WITH 
THE FBI, DEA, MARYLAND STATE 
POLICE, ABERDEEN POLICE, BEL 
AIR POLICE. 
THIS IS A HUGE PRESENCE OF LAW 
ENFORCEMENT. THE ATF TRYING TO 
USE RESOURCES TO TRACK THAT 
GUN. 
IT WAS A SINGLE GRAND CON -- 
HANDGUN. 
A LOAN SUSPECT IN THE SHOOTING. 
WE HAVE SEEN MEDEVAC HERE. 
WE BELIEVE THEY WERE AIRLIFTING 
PEOPLE FROM THE SCENE. 
WE SAW PEOPLE EVACUATED FROM 
THE SCENE. 
WE DON'T KNOW MUCH MORE ABOUT 
THE SUSPECT AT THIS POINT. 
POLICE ARE KEEPING THAT CLOSE 
TO THE VET -- VAST RIGHT NOW. 
-- VEST RIGHT NOW. 
POLICE SAY THEY DID NOT FIRE A 
SHOT IN THIS. 
WE ARE WAITING TO HEAR MORE 
INFORMATION. 
IF YOU REMEMBER THAT SHOOTING 
THAT HAPPENED 11 MONTHS AGO, WE 
HAD A SUSPECT ON THE LOOSE. 
THEY WERE PUTTING OUT THAT 
PERSON'S PICTURE. 
WE GOT A LOT MORE INFORMATION 
RIGHT OFF THE BAT IN THAT CASE. 
IN THIS CASE, IT IS DIFFERENT. 
THEY HAVE THE PERSON IN CUSTODY 
SO THEY DON'T WANT TO SAY TOO 
MUCH AND PIECE THIS TOGETHER. 
WE DON'T KNOW THE MOTIVE. 
>> MIKE, ALL DAY THEY REFUSED 
TO TAKE QUESTIONS, AS YOU JUST 
SAID THEY DID MAKE A SPECIFIC 
COMMENT WAS THAT NO STRUTS -- 
SHOTS WERE FIRED BY AN OFFICER 
WHICH WOULD LEAD THEM TO THINK 
THE SUSPECT WAS SHOT 
THEMSELVES. 
THEY DIDN'T ANSWER THAT BUT 
THAT'S THE ASSUMPTION. 
WOULD YOU AGREE? 
>> Reporter: I WOULD AGREE. 
I WOULD AGREE. 
OFFICIALLY WHAT THEY ARE SAYING 
IS THAT THIS SUSPECT IS IN 
CRITICAL CONDITION AND THEY DID 
NOT FIRE ANY SHOTS. 
OR AN OFFICER DID NOT FIRE 
SHOTS. 
WE WILL EVENTUALLY HEAR THIS 
PERSON'S NAME. 
WE DON'T KNOW IF THIS PERSON 
HAS BEEN INTERVIEWED AT THIS 
POINT. 
WE DON'T KNOW THE EXTENT OF THE 
INJURIES. 
I'M SURE THAT IS PART OF ALL OF 
THIS. 
A KEY COMPONENT ON IF THIS 
PERSON WILL COOPERATE AND 
EXACTLY WHY THAT PERSON OPENED 
FIRE AND THEIR NECKS INTO THIS 
BUSINESS HERE. 
WE DON'T KNOW WHAT THE MOMENT 
WAS -- MOTIVE WAS. 
AS THEY HAVE SAID REPEATEDLY, 
THIS IS STILL VERY PRELIMINARY 
OUT HERE. 
>> MIKE, WE ARE LOOKING AT LIVE 
PICTURE FROM CHOPPER 13 AS 
PEOPLE ARE BEING EVACUATED FROM 
THAT BUILDING. 
THEY HAVE BEEN TRANSPORTED BY 
SCHOOL BUSES. 
MORE THAN 1000 EMPLOYEES WORK 
AT THAT FACILITY. 
ALSO, WE ARE EXPECTING AN 
UPDATE FROM JOHNS HOPKINS 
BAYVIEW CAMPUS. 
SOME OF THE VICTIMS ARE 
TRANSPORTED THERE. 
MIKE, TO ASK ABOUT THE TIMELINE 
AS THIS UNFOLDED, WE ARE 
TALKING ABOUT 10 MINUTES AFTER 
9:00 THIS MORNING. 
THEN WE SAW THAT HELICOPTER 
LAND AND TAKE OFF BEHIND YOU. 
THAT WAS LESS THAN AN HOUR AGO. 
WE KEEP SAYING THAT IS A FLUID 
SCENE. IT'S UNCLEAR BUT THEY 
ARE STILL RESPONDING. 
>> Reporter: WE DON'T KNOW THE 
EXTENT OF THE INJURIES OF THE 
PEOPLE WHO WERE WOUNDED. 
WE ARE LIVE ON THE AIR AND A 
REPRESENTATIVE OF THE SHERIFF'S 
OFFICE, CHRISTIE HOPKINS, WE 
HAVE SPOKEN TO YOU BEFORE IN 
SITUATIONS LIKE THIS. 
WHAT WOULD BE YOUR MAIN MESSAGE 
TO THE COMMUNITY RIGHT NOW? 
>> I THINK WE ARE SEEING MORE 
AND MORE OF THESE SITUATIONS 
THAT THEY ARE NOT PREVENTABLE. 
KNOW COMMUNITY IS IMMUNE AND SO 
PREPARATION IS KEY. 
TRAINING IS KEY. 
WE SPENT MANY HOURS AND DAYS 
TRAINING PEOPLE ON EXACTLY WHAT 
TO DO IF THERE IS A WORKPLACE 
VIOLENCE INCIDENT OR AN ACTIVE 
SHOOTER AT THE MALL, YOUR 
WORKPLACE, WHEREVER IT MAY BE. 
WE HAVE TO CONTINUE TO LOOK AT 
THESE SITUATIONS AND 
INVESTIGATE WHY THEY HAPPEN BUT 
WE ALSO NEED TO BE TRAINING 
PEOPLE TO UNDERSTAND WHAT TO DO 
WHEN THIS IS AT YOUR DOORSTEP. 
THAT'S WHAT WE SAW TODAY. 
WE SAW PEOPLE TAKING 
PRECAUTIONS THAT WE HAVE TALKED 
ABOUT IN THE NEWS FOR SO LONG. 
WE ALSO SAW THE RESCUE TASK 
FORCE PUT IN PLACE. 
THAT'S SOMETHING WE SAW IT 
ADVANCED GRANITE WHEN THEY HAD 
THAT SHOOTING WHERE WE ARE NOW 
TRYING TO HAVE EMS PROVIDERS 
AND LAW ENFORCEMENT GO IN 
TOGETHER TO HOPEFULLY SAVE LIVES
INSIDE. 
>> PEOPLE ARE SAYING THEY WANT 
MORE INFORMATION AND HOW THIS 
UNFOLDED. 
I KNOW THE OFFICE IS SAYING 
HOLD ON A BIT. 
>> THIS IS A FLUID 
INVESTIGATION. 
THERE IS A LOT OF INFORMATION 
THAT IS PROVEN NOT TO BE TRUE. 
I VERY MUCH WOULD LIKE TO 
ENSURE THAT THE INFORMATION WE 
ARE GIVING THE COMMUNITY IS 
TRUE AND FACTUAL AND CONFIRMED 
INFORMATION. 
WE WILL CONTINUE TO UTILIZE 
RESOURCES. 
PLEASE FOLLOW US. 
THAT IS YOUR CONFIRMED SOURCE 
OF INFORMATION. 
WE WANT TO PROVIDE YOU ANSWERS 
AS MUCH AS WE WOULD LIKE TO 
HAVE THEM. 
AS SOON AS WE KNOW THEM, WE'LL 
LET THE COMMUNITY KNOW 
>> PEOPLE SHOULD FEEL LIKE THEY 
ARE IN ANY DANGER RIGHT NOW. 
>> WE HAVE NO REASON TO BELIEVE 
THERE IS ANY FURTHER THREAT. 
>> ANY OTHER MESSAGES FOR THE 
COMMUNITY? 
WE DID A STORY WITH YOU ABOUT 
THOSE FIRST RESPONDERS BEING 
TRAINED. 
I'M SURE THAT MADE A DIFFERENCE 
WITH THE OTHER SHOOTING 11 
MONTHS AGO. 
AND AGAIN TODAY, I'M SURE THAT 
KIND OF TRAINING WAS ESSENTIAL 
IN THIS? 
>> ABSOLUTELY. 
THOSE ARE THE TYPES OF TRAINING 
S THAT SAVE LIVES. 
>> THANK YOU. 
I KNOW WE WILL BE UPDATED BY 
YOU. 
THAT IS THE LATEST HERE. 
WE ARE AWAITING A PRESS 
CONFERENCE FROM JOHN HOPKINS 
BAYVIEW ABOUT MORE OF THE 
VICTIMS. THE SHERIFF OFFICE 
WILL NOT OFFICIALLY GIVE A 
NUMBER. 
THEY ARE SAYING MULTIPLE 
WOUNDED AND MULTIPLE FATALITIES.
I HAD PEOPLE ASK ON TWITTER, WE 
WANT TO KNOW WHAT HAPPENED? 
WHY CAN'T THEY GIVE OUT MORE 
INFORMATION? 
BE PATIENT. 
THIS IS PRELIMINARY. 
THIS IS JUST UNFOLDING. 
THERE IS A LOT THEY ARE TRYING 
TO LEARN AND THEY WANT TO MAKE 
SURE WHAT IS OUT THERE IS 
ACCURATE. 
YOU HEARD IT FROM THE SHERIFF'S 
OFFICE. 
YOU SAW THE PRESS CONFERENCE. 
WE ARE GOING TO CONTINUE TO 
FOLLOW THIS SITUATION. 
IT IS STILL A LARGE POLICE 
PRESENCE YOU'RE AT THE SCENE. 
>> PEOPLE ARE STILL BEING 
EVACUATED. 
IT IS UNDERSTANDABLE THAT THEY 
ARE NOT GIVING OUT INFORMATION. 
THE FIRST PRIORITY IS TO TREAT 
THE INJURED. WE DON'T KNOW HOW 
INJURED THEY MAY BE. 
THEY MAY BE CRITICAL. THEY WANT 
TO SAVE THEIR LIVES AND THEN 
IDENTIFY THEM AND THEN NOTIFY 
FAMILIES AND THEN THE PUBLIC. 
LET'S CONTINUE THE CONVERSATION 
THAT MIKE WAS HAVING WITH THE 
SPOKESWOMAN A MOMENT AGO. 
LET'S GO TO RICK RITTER TALKING 
ABOUT ACTIVE SHOOTER DRILLS. 
I KNOW HEARD THE EXECUTIVE 
TALKING ABOUT HOW THEY JUST HAD 
AN ACTIVE SHOOTER DRILL. 
ONE WOULD HOPE THAT EVERYBODY 
IN THE FACILITY KNEW WHAT TO DO 
WHEN THEY HEARD THERE WERE 
SHOTS FIRED. 
RICK. 
>> Reporter: DENISE, BARRY IS 
THE FIRST TO TELL YOU THEY HAVE 
A LOT OF EXPERIENCE WITH THIS 
WITH THREE MASS SHOOTINGS IN 3 
YEARS. 
THEY KNOW WHAT THEY ARE DOING. 
THAT'S WHY DEPUTIES WERE ABLE 
TO RESPOND WITHIN MINUTES WHEN 
THIS FIRST UNFOLDED AROUND 9:00 
THIS MORNING. 
THERE ARE A LOT OF QUESTIONS 
THAT ARE UNANSWERED RIGHT NOW. 
A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE BEGGING FOR 
MORE INFORMATION AND TRYING TO 
FIGURE OUT WHAT TOOK PLACE. 
NOW THAT WE KNOW THE SUSPECT IS 
IN CUSTODY IN CRITICAL 
CONDITION, YOU HAVE TO BELIEVE 
THAT AGENTS ARE DIGGING INTO 
THAT SUSPECT'S INFORMATION 
RIGHT NOW. 
HIS OR HER BACKGROUND, WHO THEY 
ARE WITH, THEIR CELL PHONE 
RECORDS, COMPUTERS, TRYING TO 
FIND OUT MORE. 
WE KNOW IT TOOK PLACE AROUND 
9:00 THIS MORNING. 
MULTIPLE PEOPLE WERE KILLED AND 
MULTIPLE WERE WOUNDED. 
CHOPPER 13 HAS STILL BEEN OVER 
THE SCENE. 
PEOPLE BEING EVACUATED OUT OF 
THAT RITE AID DISTRIBUTION 
CENTER.  
THERE ARE MORE THAN 1000 PEOPLE 
EMPLOYED. 
MULTIPLE PEOPLE HAVE BEEN SHOT 
MULTIPLE PEOPLE HAVE BEEN 
KILLED. 
THIS IS ANOTHER TRAGIC 
SITUATION. 
IT SEEMS LIKE JUST YESTERDAY I 
STOOD IN THIS AREA REPORTING ON 
ANOTHER MASS SHOOTING TAKING 
PLACE AT ADVANCED GRANITE 
SOLUTIONS. 
OBVIOUSLY THEY HAVE A LOT OF 
EXPERIENCE WITH THIS. 
THAT'S WHY DEPUTIES WERE ABLE 
TO RESPOND SO QUICKLY AND 
HOPEFULLY STOP IT BEFORE IT WAS 
A LOT WORSE. 
STILL A LOT OF QUESTIONS REMAIN 
UNANSWERED. 
WE DON'T KNOW HOW MANY PEOPLE 
WERE SHOT OR KILLED. 
HOPEFULLY WILL GET THAT WITHIN 
THE NEXT FEW HOURS. 
HERE AT THE MEDIA STAGING AREA  
THINGS HAVE QUIETED DOWN QUITE 
A BIT. 
IT LOOKS LIKE THE SHERIFF HAS 
LEFT THE SCENE. 
HOPEFULLY WE'LL GET ANOTHER 
UPDATE WITHIN THE NEXT FEW 
HOURS. 
IF YOU'RE JUST JOINING US, A 
SHOOTING AT THE RITE AID 
DISTRIBUTION CENTER, THE 
WAREHOUSE.  
THIS IS OFF OF SPESUTIA ROAD.  
MULTIPLE WILL KEEP WERE KILLED 
AND MULTIPLE PEOPLE INJURED. 
THE SUSPECT IS IN CUSTODY BUT 
IN CRITICAL CONDITION. 
>>> LIVE FROM TELEVISION HILL, 
THIS IS WJZ BREAKING NEWS. 
>> AS YOU JUST HEARD, WE ARE 
FOLLOWING THAT BREAKING NEWS 
OUT OF HARFORD COUNTY  WERE 
MULTIPLE PEOPLE HAVE BEEN SHOT. 
SEVERAL PEOPLE HAVE BEEN KILLED 
IN A WORKPLACE SHOOTING AT THE 
RITE AID DISTRIBUTION CENTER . 
WE ALSO KNOW THAT WE ARE 
WAITING FOR A PRESS CONFERENCE. 
WE ARE WAITING FOR A PRESS 
CONFERENCE WHERE SECURITY HAS 
STREETS BLOCKED AND MANY ARE 
WEARING BULLETPROOF VESTS. 
>> THEY CONTINUE TO EVACUATE 
WORKERS. AS YOU CAN IMAGINE, 
THEY WANT TO EVACUATE THE 
ENTIRE FACILITY TO SEARCH AND 
MAKE SURE IT IS SECURE AND MAKE 
SURE THERE ARE NO EXPLOSIVES OR 
ANYTHING ON SCENE. 
YOU NEED TO BE REASSURED IN AND 
GOING AS FAR AS THE SHERIFF'S 
OFFICE KNOWS, IT WAS A LOAN 
SUSPECT WHO IS IN CUSTODY IN 
CRITICAL CONDITION AND THE 
SHERIFF IS NOTIFYING THE 
COMMUNITY THAT THEY DO NOT HAVE 
REASON TO WORRY ABOUT A THREAT. 
>> WE HAVE SEEN HELICOPTERS 
GOING IN AND OUT WITHIN THE 
LAST HALF HOUR SO. 
MANY EMPLOYEES ARE STILL BEING 
ESCORTED OUT OF THE BUILDING.. 
MIKE SPOKE WITH A WITNESS WHO 
SAYS SHE SOUGHT MORE THAN A 
DOZEN AMBULANCES NEAR THE AREA. 
IT IS UNCLEAR HOW MANY PEOPLE 
HAVE BEEN SHOT. 
AGAIN, THE NICE -- IF THERE IS 
A SIGHT OF HER -- SILVERLINING, 
THERE IS NO IMMEDIATE THREAT. 
WE HAVE BEEN SAYING THAT THERE 
WAS A MODIFIED LOCKDOWN AT ONE 
OF THE ELEMENTARY SCHOOLS. 
THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN CHURCH 
CREEK. 
THAT WAS COMPLETELY AS A 
PRECAUTION. 
LET'S GO BACK TO MIKE WHO WAS 
ONE OF THE FIRST ON THE SCENE. 
>> Reporter: WE ARE STILL 
TRYING TO GATHER INFORMATION AS 
TO THE MOTIVE AS TO WHY THIS 
UNFOLDED. 
THE SHERIFF DID NOT TAKE ANY 
QUESTIONS. 
HE WANTED TO TELL THE COMMUNITY 
THAT THE AREA WAS SAFE AND 
THERE IS NO FURTHER THREAT. 
HE PROVIDED SOME INFORMATION 
ABOUT THAT -- 
>> WE HAVE BEEN DIPPING INTO 
LOCAL COVERAGE BUT IT LOOKS LIKE
DOCTORS ARE SPEAKING OUTSIDE OF 
THE HOSPITAL WERE A NUMBER OF 
THE VICTIMS ARE. 
LET'S LISTEN IN. 
>> I'M THE MEDICAL DIRECTOR 
HERE. 
ABOUT ALL I CAN TELL YOU IS 
THAT WE RECEIVED FOR PEOPLE 
FROM THE INCIDENT THIS MORNING. 
THEY ALL CAME AS A LEVEL TRUE 
THOMAS CENTER -- LEVEL TWO 
TRAUMA CENTER. 
WHERE WAITING FOR FAMILIES TO 
BE NOTIFIED BEFORE WE CAN GIVE 
YOU SPECIFICS. 
REALLY ALL I CAN TELL YOU IS 
THAT WE RECEIVED FOUR PATIENTS 
WITH WOUNDS EARLIER TODAY. 
>> . 
>> TO US THEY ARE ALL PATIENTS. 
EVERYTHING WE KNOW HIS SECOND 
AND THIRD HAND. 
I REALLY CAN'T COMMENT IF ONE 
IS A SHOOTER. 
>> . 
>> WE HAVE TO WAIT TO MAKE SURE 
FAMILIES ARE NOTIFIED BEFORE WE 
CAN GIVE YOU DETAILS. 
>> DID ALL FOUR HAVE GUNSHOT 
WOUNDS? 
>> YES. 
GUNSHOT WOUNDS. 
>>  
>> I THINK ALL I WANT TO SAY IS 
THEY ALL SUFFERED GUNSHOT 
WOUNDS. 
UNTIL WE HAVE A CHANCE TO TALK 
TO FAMILIES FIRST, I THINK THAT 
IS BEST FOR THE FAMILIES TO 
LEARN THEIR CONDITIONS FROM US 
DIRECTLY RATHER THAN THROUGH 
YOU, UNFORTUNATELY. 
YES. 
>> HAVE ANY OF THE VICTIMS BEEN 
TAKEN INTO SURGERY? 
>> SOME HAVE REQUIRED SURGICAL 
CARE. 
>> WERE THEY TAKEN BY MEDEVAC 
OR GROUND? 
>> BY GROUND. 
MARYLAND HAS AN EXCELLENT EMS 
SYSTEM. 
IT IS VERY WELL ORGANIZED. 
THEY ARE ALL BENEFICIARIES OF 
THAT SYSTEM. 
THEY WERE BROUGHT HERE RAPIDLY. 
>> CAN YOU GIVE US AN IDEA OF 
THEIR RARITY WHEN THEY WERE 
FIRST BROUGHT IN? 
>> IT HAS A TRIAGE SCALE. 
THEY WERE ALL CONSIDERED 
PRIORITY ONE. 
THAT'S BECAUSE THEY SUFFERED 
GUNSHOT WOUNDS. 
>>  
>> I CAN'T TELL YOU THAT UNTIL 
WE KNOW THE FAMILIES KNOW WHO 
IS HERE. 
THEY WENT TODAY ARRIVE? 
>> PROBABLY AROUND 10:00 A.M. 
>> ARE THEY ALL ADULTS? 
>> THEY ARE ALL ADULTS. 
>>  
>> I THINK THERE ARE SOME 
CONTACT NUMBERS FOR THEM TO 
CALL. 
I DON'T KNOW IF THEY CALLED THE 
HOSPITAL DIRECTLY THAT THEY ARE 
GOING TO SHARE MORE INFORMATION 
ABOUT SPECIFICS. 
I BELIEVE AUTHORITIES WILL 
NOTIFY ALL THE PATIENTS AND LET 
THEM KNOW THEY ARE HERE. 
ONCE WE HAVE HAD CONFIRMATION 
THAT HAS HAPPENED, THEN WE CAN 
GIVE MORE INFORMATION. 
>> WOULD YOU OFFER INSIGHT TO 
VIEWERS -- 
>> SO IN THE STATE OF MARYLAND, 
THERE IS AN ORGANIZATION CALLED 
MIMS.  
THEY ARE ALL TRAINED ON THE 
MIMS  PROTOCOLS. 
THERE ARE CERTAIN INJURIES THAT 
THEY WOULD DO BEST IF THEY CAME 
TO A DESIGNATED TRAUMA CENTER. 
SO IF THE PROVIDERS FEEL THEY 
MEET THOSE CRITERIA THEY WILL 
TAKE THEM TO DESIGNATED TRAUMA 
CENTERS WITHIN THE STATE OF 
MARYLAND. 
FOR THIS PART, BAY VIEW IS THE 
CLOSEST TRAUMA CENTER TO SERVE 
THEM. 
OTHER ONES WOULD BE JOHN HOPKINS
HOSPITAL AND SHOCK TRAUMA. 
AT LEAST IN THE TRAUMA 
COMMUNITY WE FEEL THAT THE 
OUTCOMES ARE IMPROVED BY GOING 
TO DESIGNATED TRAUMA CENTERS. 
THIS IS ONE EVENT WHERE THAT 
WILL PROBABLY PROVE TO BE TRUE. 
>>  
>> AT LEAST AT THIS TIME, WE 
ARE BUSINESS AS USUAL. 
WHEN WE DIDN'T KNOW HOW MANY 
PEOPLE WE WERE GETTING, WE KIND 
OF ADAPTED TO BE READY TO TAKE 
MORE PATIENTS. 
AGAIN, IN THE STATE OF MARYLAND,
THE STATE TRIED TO DISTRIBUTE 
PATIENTS BEST TO WHERE THERE WAS
RESOURCES AND CAPABILITY ABILITY
-- AVAILABLE. 
THEY TRIED TO OFFLOAD THE 
NUMBER OF CASUALTIES BY 
DISTURBING THEM TO OTHER TRAUMA 
CENTERS IN THE REGION. 
>> ARE ANY THE PEOPLE SAYING 
ANYTHING ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED? 
>> I HAVE NOT HAD CONVERSATIONS 
LIKE THAT WITH ANY PATIENT. 
I CAN'T SAY. 
>> CAN YOU TELL US BEHIND THE 
SCENES -- 
>> TO BE HONEST WHAT IS 
HAPPENING NOW IS AFTER THEY 
CAME IN AFTER THAT EVENT, 
THINGS WENT BACK TO BUSINESS AS 
USUAL. 
AS A TRAUMA CENTER, WE LOOK AT 
PATIENTS LIKE THIS IN MULTIPLE 
EVENTS OR SINGLE EVENTS AND WE 
TAKE CARE OF THEM. 
ONCE THE SURGE OCCURRED AND WE 
WERE COMFORTABLE THERE WEREN'T 
MORE PATIENTS COMING IN, THEN 
IT WAS BUSINESS AS USUAL AGAIN. 
>> ARE THEY IN THE TRAUMA ICU? 
>> WE HAVE A SINGLE SURGICAL 
ICU FOR TRAUMA AND OTHER 
SURGICAL PATIENTS. 
IF ANY OF THEM MERITED THAT 
CARE, THEY WOULD BE THERE. 
AGAIN, I DON'T WANT TO COMMENT 
ON SPECIFIC CONDITIONS OF ANY 
PATIENTS. 
>>  
>> ONCE WE HAVE CONFIRMATION 
THAT THE FAMILIES HAVE BEEN 
INFORMED THAT THE LOVED ONES 
ARE HERE AND THAT WE HAVE HAD A 
CHANCE TO TALK RECTALLY TO THE 
FAMILIES AND LET THEM KNOW THE 
CONDITIONS PERHAPS WE CAN SHARE 
MORE INFORMATION ABOUT THOSE 
SPECIFIC PATIENTS. 
>> AUTHORITIES ARE THE ONES 
THAT ARE REACHING OUT FOR THOSE 
CONTACTS. 
OKAY? 
THANK YOU. 
>> SO WE ARE NOT GETTING A LOT 
OF INFORMATION FROM DOCTORS 
HERE AT JOHN HOPKINS BAYVIEW. 
HE SAID THEY ARE TREATING THEM 
FOR GUNSHOT WOUNDS.  
THIS STEMS FROM A SHOOTING THAT 
HAPPENED MUCH EARLIER IN THE DAY
,  SHORTLY AFTER 9:00 AT THIS 
RITE AID DISTRIBUTION CENTER . 
WHAT WE ARE LEARNING IS THAT 
THE SHOOTER ENTERED THE FACILITY
AND BEGAN SHOOTING. 
WHAT WE HAVE LEARNED -- NOT 
FROM POLICE BUT THE ASSOCIATED 
PRESS AND IS YET TO BE 
CONFIRMED BY OFFICERS THAT AT 
LEAST THREE PEOPLE WERE KILLED. 
SEVERAL MORE WERE ALSO SHOT AND 
WOUNDED. 
IT APPEARS AS IF THE SHOOTER 
WAS ALSO WOUNDED. WE DON'T KNOW 
IF IT WAS A GUNSHOT WOUND OR 
NOT. 
THAT SHOOTER IS IN CRITICAL 
CONDITION IN THE HOSPITAL. 
>> ONE OF THE REASONS THERE 
WERE A LOT OF QUESTIONS THROWN 
AT THE DOCTOR BUT HE WASN'T 
GIVING INFORMATION IS BECAUSE 
SOME OF THE ONLY MEMBERS 
HAVEN'T BEEN NOTIFIED. 
ONCE WE GET MORE INFORMATION 
FROM THE HOSPITAL AND THE 
POLICE, WE'LL SHARE THAT WITH 
YOU. 
FIRST WE'RE GOING TO SEND YOU 
BACK TO WJZ IN BALTIMORE. 
LET'S LISTEN IN. 
>> I THINK THE AUTHORITIES ARE 
THE ONES THAT ARE REACHING OUT 
FOR THOSE CONTACTS. 
OKAY? 
ALL RIGHT. 
THANK YOU. 
>> WE HAVE BEEN LISTENING TO A 
DOCTOR AT JOHN HOPKINS BAYVIEW  
TALK ABOUT THE FOUR PATIENTS 
WHO WERE TAKEN TO THEIR TRAUMA 
CENTER. 
WHAT IS IMPORTANT THAT THERE 
ARE FOUR PATIENTS THAT ARE BEING
TREATED AT THE TRAUMA CENTER. 
TO HIM, TO THE HOSPITAL, THEY 
ARE PATIENTS. 
HE COULD NOT CONFIRM OR DENY IF 
THE SHOOTER WAS TAKEN TO JOHN 
HOPKINS BAYVIEW. 
>> I WAS HOPING SOMEBODY WOULD 
ASK , DEVON SAID THERE WERE 
SEVERAL GUARDS OUT THERE WITH 
THE PROOF VEST. 
>> DEVON TWEETED THIS. 
>> SO MY QUESTION IS, WHY? 
WHAT DO WE KNOW ABOUT THAT? 
ARE THEY STILL WALKING AROUND. 
MY UNDERSTANDING IS THERE IS 
NOT A THREAT TO THE HOSPITAL. 
THERE IS NOT AN IMMEDIATE 
úTHRE.
BUT IT IS AS CLEAR -- UNCLEAR 
AS TO WHY THAT IS THE CASE. 
LET'S GO BACK OUT TO RICK RITTER
LIVE WITH MORE. 
RICK. 
>> AGAIN, THAT WAS A DOCTOR FOR 
JOHN HOPKINS BAYVIEW  MEDICAL 
CENTER WHO SAID THEY RECEIVED 
FOUR PATIENTS BY GROUND. 
THEY WERE ALL PRIORITY ONE. 
SOME HAVE ALREADY UNDERGONE 
SURGERY. 
THEY ARE STILL TRYING TO NOTIFY 
FAMILIES. 
THAT GIVES YOU AN IDEA OF HOW 
MANY PEOPLE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT 
THAT IT BEEN IMPACTED OR 
INJURED. 
FOUR BY GROUND. 
MIKE HAS BEEN LIVE ON THE SCENE 
WITH THE MEDEVAC GOING UP AND 
DOWN AND UP AND DOWN. AT LEAST 
FOUR WERE TAKEN BY GROUND TO THE
JOHN HOPKINS BAYVIEW MEDICAL 
CENTER. 
WE HEARD FROM THE HARFORD 
COUNTY  SHERIFF A LITTLE WHILE 
AGO, PAINTING A GRIM PICTURE OF 
WHAT TOOK PLACE AT THIS RITE 
AID DISTRIBUTION CENTER TODAY 
SAYING THAT CAME  -- CALL CAME 
AROUND 9:00. 
DEPUTIES ARRIVED WITHIN ABOUT 
FIVE ME -- MINUTES. 
MULTIPLE PEOPLE HAVE BEEN 
KILLED AND MULTIPLE PEOPLE 
INJURED. 
THEY ARE NOT ELABORATING ON 
THAT. 
ALONE SUSPECT TAKEN INTO 
CUSTODY. 
THEY ARE NOT SAYING IF IT IS A 
FEMALE OR MALE. 
THEY ARE IN CRITICAL CONDITION. 
AGAIN WE HEARD FROM THE HARFORD 
COUNTY  SHERIFF AND EXECUTIVE. 
HERE'S WHAT HE HAD TO SAY. 
>> I FOLLOWED THIS FROM THE 
MOMENT THE CALL CAME IN ON 
DISPATCH. 
I LISTENED TO THE RADIO 
TRANSMISSIONS. 
UNFORTUNATELY IN TODAY'S WORLD 
WE HAVE ACTIVE SHOOTER DRILLING 
AND DRILLS. 
I CAN TELL YOU AND THE CITIZENS 
THAT EVERY AGENCY PERFORMED AT 
THE TOP OF THEIR PROFESSION. 
AND THE RESPONSE FROM ALL THE 
ALLIED AGENCIES WAS GREAT. 
VOLUNTEER FIRE AND EMS 
RESPONDED WITH MEDICAL UNITS. 
I'M THANKFUL TO ALL THE 
AGENCIES THAT CAME OUT TO HELP 
US TODAY TO GET THROUGH THIS. 
THIS IS BECOMING A TOO OFTEN 
OCCURRENCE NOT ONLY IN HARFORD 
COUNTY  -- 
>> Reporter: UNFORTUNATELY, 
THIS IS BECOMING THE NEW 
NORMAL. 
SO MANY AGENCIES ARE DOING 
TRAINING AND MAKING SURE THEY 
ARE UP TO THE FINEST STANDARDS 
IN ALL OF THIS. 
UNFORTUNATELY, THERE IS SO MUCH 
EXPERIENCE. 
THREE MASS SHOOTINGS IN 3 YEARS.
THE LAST ONE TAKING PLACE 
LITERALLY 11 MONTHS AGO ABOUT 
SEVEN MILES FROM HERE AT 
ANOTHER SHOOTING. 
THAT SUSPECT WAS TAKEN INTO 
CUSTODY MUCH LATER ON. 
THE SUSPECT IN THIS CASE IS IN 
CUSTODY IN CRITICAL CONDITION. 
THIS IS A HEARTBREAKING 
SCENARIO. 
LOVED ONES ARE TRYING TO FIND 
MORE INFORMATION. 
PEOPLE ARE REACHING OUT AND 
DROPPING THEIR NAMES ASKING IF 
THEY KNOW THEM. 
THAT'S THE HEARTBREAKING 
SITUATIONS THAT WE ARE STARTING 
TO HEAR ABOUT. 
AGAIN, MULTIPLE PEOPLE WERE 
KILLED AND MULTIPLE PEOPLE WERE 
WOUNDED. 
ALONE SUSPECT IS IN CUSTODY BUT 
IN CRITICAL CONDITION. 
NOW THAT THEY HAVE THAT 
SUSPECT, THEY OBVIOUSLY KNOW 
THE SUSPECT'S IDENTITY. 
THEY ARE GOING TO BE DIGGING 
INTO THEIR BACKGROUND AND 
TRYING TO GET MORE INFORMATION. 
COMPUTERS, CELL PHONE RECORDS, 
SPEAKING WITH PEOPLE HE OR SHE 
KNOWS AND TRYING TO FIGURE OUT 
WHY THIS UNFOLDED. 
>> RICK, INTERRUPTING YOU FOR A 
SECOND, YOU ARE ABSOLUTELY 
RIGHT. 
THERE ARE LOTS OF PEOPLE WHO 
ARE DISTRESSED. 
IN CASE YOU HAVE NOT HEARD, WE 
WILL REPEAT THIS THROUGHOUT THE 
DAY. 
THERE IS A PHONE NUMBER THAT 
THE HARFORD COUNTY  SHERIFF'S 
OFFICE HAS SET UP. 
WE DON'T HAVE ANSWERS. 
THE DOCTOR AT JOHN HOPKINS 
BAYVIEW  CAN'T GIVE 
INFORMATION. 
THE NUMBER IS 410-838-5800.  
FEEL FREE TO HAND THAT OUT ON 
SOCIAL MEDIA TO ANYONE WHO YOU 
THINK NEEDS TO KNOW IT. 
THAT IS 410-838-5800. 
THAT'S THE NUMBER THAT THE 
SHERIFF'S  OFFICE IS SET UP. IF 
YOU KNOW SOMEONE OR YOUR RELATED
TO SOMEONE, HOPE YOU CAN GET 
ANSWERS. 
I ALSO GOT A TWEET FROM AN 
OFFICIAL WHO SAID IT IS 
PROTOCOL TO WEAR A VEST WHEN 
RESPONDING TO ANY CALL 
INVOLVING THE POSSIBILITY OF 
PERSONAL HARM. 
THANK YOU SO MUCH. 
MY QUESTION IS REGARDING THE 
HOSPITAL SPECIFICALLY. 
HE DID SAY IT IS BUSINESS AS 
USUAL AS FAR AS THEY KNOW. 
ANYTIME YOU HAVE A SITUATION 
LIKE THIS, MY QUESTION WOULD BE 
IT'S UNCLEAR IF THE SUSPECT IN 
THE CASE WAS TAKEN TO JOHN 
HOPKINS BAYVIEW  AND IF THERE 
IS ANY THREAT TO ANYONE IN THAT 
TRAUMA DEPARTMENT. THAT'S WHY I 
WAS TRYING TO SEE THAT THERE 
WAS SOME SORT OF CONNECTION. 
I THINK THAT WILL COME TO LIGHT 
AS THIS INVESTIGATION 
PROGRESSES. 
ME THE DOCTOR SAID TO THE 
FACILITY, -- 
>> TO THE DOCTOR, THEY ARE 
PATIENTS. 
WHAT TIME DID YOU GET THERE, 
MIKE ASKED 9:20? 9:30? 
>> IT WAS IN THE 9:00 HOUR. 
ONE NEW DEVELOP,  THE JOHN 
HOPKINS BAYVIEW SHERIFF'S 
OFFICE  IS ASKING ANYONE WHO 
WAS STILL INSIDE THESE 
BUILDINGS HERE TO DIAL 911 SO 
THAT THEY KNOW WHERE THEY ARE. 
THEY HAVE TO GO THROUGH THESE 
BUILDINGS. 
I WILL REDO THE TWEET. 
AT THIS TIME THE HARFORD COUNTY 
SHERIFF'S OFFICE WOULD ASK 
ANYONE THAT MAY STILL BE IN THE 
BUILDING TO DIAL 911 SO DEPUTIES
CAN LOCATE YOU. 
STILL, A LOT OF POLICE ARE ON 
THE SCENE. 
THEY ARE EARLY IN THE 
INVESTIGATION. 
THEY HAVE TO GO THROUGH THAT 
BUILDING TO GIVE THE ALL CLEAR 
EVEN THOUGH WE KNOW THERE IS NO 
THREAT ACCORDING TO THE SHERIFF 
HERE. THEY HAVE TO GO THROUGH 
EVERY INCH OF THAT BUILDING. 
THAT IS SOMETHING WE HAVE SEEN 
THEM DO IN THIS VERY COUNTY, 
AFTER MASS SHOOTINGS. WE TALKED 
ABOUT BULLETPROOF VESTS AT THE 
HOSPITAL. 
YOU HEARD THE ONE QUESTION WAS 
-- WAS THE SUSPECTED SHOOTER 
TAKEN TO JOHN HOPKINS BAYVIEW ? 
THE DOCTOR WOULD NOT ANSWER 
THAT QUESTION. 
HE WOULD NOT PROVIDE THAT 
INFORMATION. 
WE DO KNOW THAT THE SUSPECT WAS 
CRITICALLY INJURED. LEASE 
DIDN'T FIRE THE BULLET THEY 
SAY. 
BUT THE SUSPECT WAS CRITICALLY 
INJURED. 
HE OR SHE WAS TAKEN TO A 
HOSPITAL. 
WE DON'T KNOW WHERE THAT 
SUSPECT IS AT THIS POINT. 
WE DON'T KNOW IF POLICE HAVE 
BEEN ABLE TO AT THIS POINT 
INTERVIEWED THE SUSPECT. 
BUT WE DID SPEAK TO SOME 
CIVILIAN PEOPLE OUT HERE AT THE 
SCENE ABOUT WHAT THEY HAVE SEEN.
LET'S TAKE A LISTEN TO THAT 
RIGHT NOW. 
>> IT HAS BEEN ABSOLUTELY CRAZY.
ALL THE ROADS ARE CUT OFF. 
THEY ARE NOT EVEN SUPPOSED TO 
LET CARS DOWN HERE. 
THEY ARE JUST USING ANY LARGER 
VEHICLES -- THEY ARE TELLING 
SOME PEOPLE TO DIVERT THROUGH 
THE GRAVEYARD, SOMEWHAT. 
THERE ARE SO MANY CARS. 
I THINK I COUNTED AT LEAST 13 
AMBULANCES. 
THAT WAS JUST WHEN I WAS 
COUNTING. 
AND A LOT OF VEHICLES, THEY ARE 
STILL LOOKING, INVESTIGATING. 
>> Reporter: THAT WAS EARLIER 
TODAY. 
WE HAVE TO TELL YOU THERE ARE 
STILL SOME ROADS BLOCKED OFF 
HERE IN FRONT OF THIS 
DISTRIBUTION CENTER. 
YOU CAN SEE THERE IS STILL A 
LARGE POLICE PRESENCE OUT HERE 
AT THE SCENE. 
AGAIN, THE HARFORD COUNTY  
SHERIFF'S OFFICE TO CALL 911 IF 
YOU'RE STILL INSIDE THE 
BUILDING. 
NOW WE ARE SEEING ANOTHER EMPTY 
HARFORD COUNTY  SCHOOL BUS 
GOING BACK TO THE SCENE. 
EARLIER WE SAW THREE SCHOOL 
BUSES THAT WERE BROUGHT IN 
HERE. 
I TOOK PEOPLE OUT ABOUT HALF AN 
HOUR LATER. 
WE ARE SEEING ANOTHER SCHOOL 
BUS ENTER THE ENTRANCE HERE TO 
THIS RITE AID DISTRIBUTION 
CENTER . PERHAPS THEY ARE 
GATHERING MORE PEOPLE TO TAKE 
THEM BACK OUT FROM THE SCENE. 
BUT ANOTHER SCHOOL BUSES 
ARRIVING HERE AT THE SCENE. 
IT APPEARS THAT THEY ARE STILL 
TRYING TO CLEAR THIS BUILDING 
AND MAKE SURE THAT THERE IS NO 
ONE INSIDE. 
THEY ARE STILL TRYING TO MAKE 
SURE THAT ANY CIVILIANS ARE OUT
. THAT IS ANOTHER ASPECT OF 
MAKING SURE THE SCENE IS 
TOTALLY UNDER CONTROL HERE. 
AS YOU HEARD FROM THAT WITNESS 
ON THE SCENE, IT IS JUST A 
CHAOTIC SITUATION. 
AND SOMETHING THAT IS SUCH A 
QUIET AREA AND YOU DON'T EXPECT 
IT. 
AND SADLY WE HAVE SEEN OTHER 
SHOOTINGS JUST DOWN THE ROAD 
HERE FROM PANERA BREAD TO 
ADVANCED GRANITE LAST YEAR. 
BUT ANOTHER SCHOOL BUSES 
ARRIVING ON THE SCENE AND 
TRYING TO CLEAR OUT THIS 
BUILDING AND ASKING PEOPLE IN 
THE BUILDING TO CALL 911 SO 
THEY CAN LOCATE THEM. 
THAT IS THOUGH LATEST FROM HERE 
IN FRONT OF THIS RITE AID 
DISTRIBUTION CENTER. 
>>  BRIEFLY, IF YOU'RE STILL 
THERE, WERE YOU NOT SURPRISED 
WHEN THE SHERIFF SAID IT WAS A 
SINGLE WEAPON? IT WAS A HANDGUN?
MULTIPLE FATALITIES, MULTIPLE 
INJURIES, AND A HANDGUN? 
>> Reporter: I MEAN, -- HE 
DIDN'T DESCRIBE THE WEAPON 
BEYOND THAT OR IF ANYTHING WAS 
USED TO ENHANCE THAT WEAPON. 
WE DON'T KNOW. 
IT WAS SURPRISING. 
RIGHT NOW, WE HAVE THE ATF OUT 
HERE. 
AND THERE WAS A LARGE ATF 
PRESENTS. I CAN TELL YOU. 
-- WE DON'T KNOW IF ANYTHING 
WAS USED TO ENHANCE THAT. YES 
IT WAS SURPRISING. 
WE HAVE TO WAIT AND SEE BUT 
FROM WHAT THE SHERIFF SAID, A 
HANDGUN AND HE ALONG WITH THE 
ATF ARE LOOKING MORE AT THAT 
WEAPON AND MORE DETAILS WILL 
COME OUT. 
THE THANK YOU, MIKE. 
>> WE WANT TO UPDATE YOU KNOW 
-- THE HARFORD COUNTY  SHERIFF 
IS UP LIGHTING -- UPDATING THE 
PHONE NUMBER. 
THE PHONE NUMBER IS NOW 410-638-
3826.  
A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE ASKING FOR 
HELP REUNITING WITH FAMILY 
MEMBERS. 
THE NUMBER IS 410-638-3826.  
WHERE GOING LIVE TO JOHN 
HOPKINS BAYVIEW.  
>> WE JUST HEARD FROM THE HEAD 
OF THE TRAUMA MEDICAL CENTER 
HERE AT BAYVIEW. 
THERE ARE A FEW CARS THAT ARE 
BLOCKING THINGS OFF. 
WE DID SEE SECURITY GUARDS 
WEARING BULLETPROOF VESTS. ONCE 
THEY RECEIVED EVERYONE, THEY 
HAVE FOUR PATIENTS HERE AND 
EVERYTHING WENT BACK TO NORMAL. 
HE SAID AGAIN, FOUR PEOPLE WERE 
BROUGHT HERE BY AMBULANCE AND 
TREATED AS A PRIORITY WHEN 
BECAUSE THEY ALL HAD GUNSHOT 
WOUNDS. 
THAT'S REALLY ALL THE 
INFORMATION THAT HE COULD SHARE 
WITH US. 
HE SAID THOSE PEOPLE'S FAMILIES 
HAVE NOT BEEN NOTIFIED AND 
POLICE ARE WORKING TO CONNECT 
WITH THEIR FAMILIES AND TELL 
THEM WHERE THEY ARE. 
WE DO NOT KNOW THE AGES, THE 
GENDERS, WE DON'T KNOW THE 
NATURE OF INJURIES OF THE 
VICTIMS THAT ARE HERE. 
SEVERAL OF THEM NEEDED SURGERY. 
THAT'S ALL THAT THE DOCTOR 
WOULD TELL US. 
OTHERWISE, THEY WERE BRACED FOR 
IMPACT HERE WHEN THEY HEARD 
THEY WERE GETTING VICTIMS FROM 
A MASS SHOOTING. 
THEY WERE PREPARED TO RECEIVE 
PEOPLE. 
ONCE THEY RECEIVED ONLY FOUR 
PATIENTS IT WENT BACK TO 
BUSINESS AS USUAL. 
OTHER FAMILIES MAY NOT NOTICE 
ANY DIFFERENCE WHEN THEY COME 
TO THE HOSPITAL HERE. 
ACTUALLY FOR LOOK TO THE LEFT, 
YOU CAN SEE TWO OF THE SECURITY 
GUARDS THAT HAVE THE 
BULLETPROOF THAT'S. 
THEY ARE JUST WALKING WITH -- 
VESTS. 
THEY ARE JUST WALKING WITH 
SECURITY HERE. 
HE SAYS WE WILL GET ANOTHER 
UPDATE AT 2:30. 
WE ARE HOPING WE MIGHT FIND OUT 
MORE INFORMATION ABOUT THE FOUR 
PATIENT THAT ARE HERE AND IF 
ONE OF THEM MAY BE THE SHOOTING 
SUSPECT. 
AGAIN, THE SUSPECT IS IN 
CRITICAL CONDITION BUT WE HAVE 
NOT BEEN TOLD WHAT HOSPITAL 
THAT PERSON IS THAT. 
THE DOCTOR SAID HERE THEY ARE 
ALL PATIENTS AND HE CAN'T TELL 
US THAT. 
>> THANK YOU VERY MUCH. 
NOW LET'S GO OVER TO NICOLE. 
SHE HAS BEEN CAREFULLY 
MONITORING SOCIAL MEDIA. 
>> WE ARE UP TO 18,000 TWEETS. 
THE HARFORD COUNTY SHERIFF'S  
DEPARTMENT EVERYTHING NEEDS TO 
BE VERIFIED AND MAKE SURE IT IS 
ACCURATE. 
WE ARE TRACKING SOCIAL MEDIA 
RIGHT NOW. 
THE LATEST TWEET CAME FROM THE 
SHERIFF SAYING THE OFFICE WANTS 
ANYBODY THAT MAY STILL BE IN 
THE BUILDING TO CALL 911 SO 
DEPUTIES CAN LOCATE YOU. 
IF YOU'RE STILL IN THAT 
BUILDING, THE DEPUTIES NEED YOU 
TO GIVE THEM A CALL. 
WE ALSO TAKE A LOOK AT SOME OF 
THE OTHER TWEETS. 
WE KNOW THERE WAS A LOAN 
SUSPECT THE SUSPECT IS IN 
CRITICAL CONDITION IN THE 
HOSPITAL AT THIS TIME. 
THE SHERIFF'S OFFICE IS ALSO 
CONFIRMING MULTIPLE WOUNDED AND 
MULTIPLE FATALITIES. 
THE FIRST REPORT CAME AT 9:06 
OF SHOTS FIRED AT THE RITE AID 
DISTRIBUTION CENTER . THEY WERE 
ON THE SCENE WITHIN FIVE 
MINUTES. 
WE KNOW ALL HANDS WERE ON BOARD.
THERE IS A FAMILY REUNIFICATION 
CENTER SET UP AT HAVRE DE GRACE 
.  THE ADDRESS IS 3633 LEVEL 
VILLAGE ROAD . AGAIN THAT IS 
FOR FAMILIES TRYING TO FIND 
LOVED ONES AND REUNITING. 
ANYTHING THAT YOU MAY BE 
SHARING OR SEEING MAKE SURE IT 
IS FROM A VERIFIED SOURCE. 
WE HAVE SEEN SOME PEOPLE 
CHECKING IN. 
WE ARE MONITORING NEW 
INFORMATION. 
IF YOU'RE STILL IN THE AREA, 
PLEASE CALL 911 SO DEPUTIES CAN 
FIND YOUR PICK 
>> THANK YOU, NICOLE. 
-- FINDS YOU. 
>> THANK YOU, NICOLE. 
AS WE HAVE BEEN TRYING TO TELL 
THOSE LISTENING TO OUR 
COVERAGE FROM OUR BALTIMORE 
STATION WJZ ON THAT DEADLY 
SHOOTING IN MARYLAND, AND 
HERE'S THE LATEST. 
MULTIPLE PEOPLE HAVE BEEN 
KILLED AND WOUNDED IN PERRYMAN 
WHICH IS ABOUT 30 MILES 
NORTHEAST OF BALTIMORE. 
THE SHOOTING HAPPENED AT A RITE 
AID DISTRIBUTION CENTER. 
THE INVESTIGATION IS STILL 
FLUID. 
BUT WE KNOW THAT THE F.B.I. 
AND THE A.A.T.F. 
ARE HELPING OUT. 
HERE'S HARFORD COUNTY SHERIFF 
JEFFLY GAHLER. 
>> BASED ON WHAT WE KNOW RIGHT 
NOW AND AGAIN VERY PRELIMINARY, 
THE LONE SUSPECT IN THIS 
INCIDENT IS IN CUSTODY AND IS 
IN CRITICAL CONDITION AT A 
LOCAL HOSPITAL. 
IT APPEARS TO BE A SINGLE 
WEAPON THAT WAS USED, A HANDGUN 
AND THERE WERE NO SHOTS FIRED 
BY ANY OF THE LAW ENFORCEMENT 
OFFICERS RESPONDING TO THE 
SCENE. 
>>>  THIS WAS THE THIRD 
SHOOTING AT A WORK PLACE IN THE 
LAST THREE DAYS. 
WE'LL HAVE MORE ON THIS AS WE 
LEARN IT. 
>>>  REPUBLICAN SENATORS WARN 
THAT TIMING IS RUNNING OUT FOR 
BRETT KAVANAUGH'S ACCUSER, 
PROFESSO CHRISTINE BLASEY FORD 
TO AGREE TO TESTIFY BEFORE THE 
SENATE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE. 
COMMITTEE CHAIRMAN CHUCK 
GRASSLEY TOLD FORD'S LAWYERS 
THE BURDEN IS ON THEM AND THAT 
THEY HAVE UNTIL 10:00 A.M. 
ON FRIDAY TO SAY WHETHER OR NOT 
FORD WILL TESTIFY. 
THE HEARING WOULD INCLUDE JUST 
TWO WITNESS, FORD AND 
KAVANAUGH. 
FORD'S LAWYER CALLED THE 
PROCESS, QUOTE, NOT A FAIR OR 
GOOD-FAITH INVESTIGATION, IN 
PART BECAUSE THE GOP HAS
