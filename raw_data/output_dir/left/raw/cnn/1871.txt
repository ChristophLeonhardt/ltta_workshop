00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,130
hundreds of evacuees are now making
their way inside the Osteen Houston

2
00:00:05,130 --> 00:00:09,800
megachurch this is yesterday afternoon
but there's been a lot of critics for

3
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:14,940
pastor Osteen saying that that church
should have welcomed victims much sooner

4
00:00:14,940 --> 00:00:19,560
the pastor wants to respond to his
critics he joins us now the church has

5
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:24,210
always been open we we our doors we've
received we received shelter victims

6
00:00:24,210 --> 00:00:28,380
just the first day or two but there was
a time Chris that the place was flooded

7
00:00:28,380 --> 00:00:31,260
that's that's not a true statement
people that say that aren't we have

8
00:00:31,260 --> 00:00:34,559
flood gates right behind me over to the
right and it was within a foot of that

9
00:00:34,559 --> 00:00:38,129
so there was a safety issue the first
day or two I mean you're seeing you know

10
00:00:38,129 --> 00:00:42,210
as well as I do this was a huge storm so
but the idea that we wouldn't receive

11
00:00:42,210 --> 00:00:47,010
people I mean we've been here in this
community for 60 years in Allison of

12
00:00:47,010 --> 00:00:51,600
tropical storm Allison we house 3,000
people so we've always been open there's

13
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:56,100
a big shelter four miles away the city
shelter that has all the dormitories

14
00:00:56,100 --> 00:00:59,789
once they filled up people started
coming here but how this notion got

15
00:00:59,789 --> 00:01:03,059
started that we're not a shelter and
we're not taking people in as a false
