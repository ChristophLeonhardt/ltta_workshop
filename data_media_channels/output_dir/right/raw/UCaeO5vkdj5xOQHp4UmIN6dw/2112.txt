00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">I believe that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the first principle of</font>

2
00:00:02,220 --> 00:00:04,080
conservatism is that truth matters you

3
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:05,609
know why truth matters truth matters

4
00:00:05,609 --> 00:00:07,620
because you have value as an individual

5
00:00:07,620 --> 00:00:10,380
and when I lie to you i am devaluing you

6
00:00:10,380 --> 00:00:13,019
as a human<font color="#E5E5E5"> being taking lies as part of</font>

7
00:00:13,019 --> 00:00:15,240
politics is<font color="#CCCCCC"> not acceptable suggesting</font>

8
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:16,949
that lying is<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so long as it's</font>

9
00:00:16,949 --> 00:00:18,000
someone on your side that<font color="#CCCCCC"> is not</font>

10
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,250
acceptable yours valuing people who have

11
00:00:20,250 --> 00:00:21,840
to make a free decision<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the basis of</font>

12
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:23,970
information they are given you cannot do

13
00:00:23,970 --> 00:00:26,160
that and see<font color="#CCCCCC"> yourself as a decent human</font>

14
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:28,590
being lies are not acceptable in

15
00:00:28,590 --> 00:00:30,660
politics just because it's politics just

16
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:31,859
because everybody else is cynical

17
00:00:31,859 --> 00:00:33,719
doesn't mean you have to be and just

18
00:00:33,719 --> 00:00:35,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">because that cynicism sometimes results</font>

19
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:37,050
in victory doesn't mean it results in

20
00:00:37,050 --> 00:00:39,090
ultimate victory because ultimately when

21
00:00:39,090 --> 00:00:40,410
<font color="#CCCCCC">you promised people</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> things they can't</font>

22
00:00:40,410 --> 00:00:42,930
deliver when you promised people<font color="#CCCCCC"> things</font>

23
00:00:42,930 --> 00:00:44,579
that are not delivered you end up

24
00:00:44,579 --> 00:00:45,680
undermining your own credibility

25
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:47,640
standing out to the side saying what

26
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:49,620
truth matters truth always matters and

27
00:00:49,620 --> 00:00:51,600
if<font color="#CCCCCC"> that means that sometimes we lose</font>

28
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:53,280
that means sometimes we lose in the end

29
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:55,199
the only things worth winning are the

30
00:00:55,199 --> 00:00:57,270
things that<font color="#E5E5E5"> are based on truth and I</font>

31
00:00:57,270 --> 00:00:58,469
know there's this mentality that now

32
00:00:58,469 --> 00:01:00,359
dominates on a certain segments of

33
00:01:00,359 --> 00:01:01,590
Republicans that<font color="#E5E5E5"> says okay well</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> if we</font>

34
00:01:01,590 --> 00:01:03,359
<font color="#E5E5E5">have to lie here here and here in order</font>

35
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:04,769
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get the bigger truth conservatism</font>

through that will be<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay that's not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> how</font>

37
00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:08,820
it works if you have to lie here here

38
00:01:08,820 --> 00:01:10,260
and here in<font color="#E5E5E5"> order to get conservatism</font>

39
