COULD BE A BIG FLOP FOR REPUBLICANS. WE BEGIN WITH HILLARY. HI, NEIL. NATIONAL DEMOCRATS TELL ME THIS CALIFORNIA PRIMARY IS MAKE OR BREAK. VOTING IS UNDERWAY RIGHT NOW IN HUNTINGTON BEACH, CALIFORNIA. ONE OF THE DISTRICTS DEMOCRATS POURED MILLIONS OF DOLLARS INTO. THEY HAVE BEEN COUNTING ON A BLUE WAVE HITTING CALIFORNIA TO ADD TO THEIR TALLY OF SEATS. NATIONAL DEMOCRATS TELL ME THEY'RE WORRIED THEY COULD BE LEFT OFF THE BALLOT ENTIRELY. THE DCCC HAS HAD TO DUMB MILLIONS IN RACES AND ASK CANDIDATES TO GET OUT. STILL, THEY'RE WORRIED IT WON'T BE ENOUGH. THEY'RE TARGETED TEN SEATS IN THE RACE. TWO ARE RETIRING. DARRELL ISSA AND ED ROYCE. AND THEY'RE TARGETING TWO SEATS THAT REPUBLICANS ARE TRYING TO HOLD ON TO. CONGRESSMAN WARBACKER AND MIMI WALTERS. THESE FOUR DISTRICTS VOTED FOR HILLARY CLINTON IN 2016. DEMOCRATS SAW AN ADVANTAGE TO USE IN 2018. I'M UP AGAINST TWO MILLIONAIRES AND WE KNOW THERE'S BILLIONAIRES THAT ARE FINANCING MOST OF WHAT THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY DOES. SO THE PUBLIC WILL WAKE UP TO THAT. IT'S NOT IN THE INTERESTS OF HARD WORKING PEOPLE TO SUPPORT SOME POLITICAL CLIQUE THAT IS TRYING TO BASICALLY CONTROL THE STATE AND CONTROL THEIR LIVES. I'M CONFIDENT AND THE REPUBLICAN PARTY IS ABOUT READY TO SURGE BACK IN CALIFORNIA AS COMPARED TO THIS BLUE WAVE THAT WE'RE BEING TOLD IS COMING. HERE IN HUNTINGTON BEACH, SCOTT BAH IS CLOSE FRIENDS WITH ROYBACKER BUT HE'SES WILL FIGHTING FOR HIS SEAT. HE SAID IF THE TWO FACE OFF IN NOVEMBER THAT WOULD LEAVE DEMOCRATS OFF THE BALLOT ENTIRELY. YOUR CHALLENGING A FELLOW REPUBLICAN. WHAT I WANT TO KNOW IS HOW DO YOU THINK THAT ACTUALLY HELPS REPUBLICANS ON PRIMARY DAY? IF THE REPUBLICANS HAVE TWO IN THE PLAYOFFS, TWO IN THE GENERAL ELECTION, IT MEANS THIS SEAT IS REMOVED FROM THE DEMOCRAT CALCULATION ALTOGETHER. THEY CAN'T WIN THE SEAT BECAUSE THEY DON'T HAVE A CANDIDATE IN THE GENERAL ELECTIONS. A DEMOCRATIC LOCK-OUT COULD BE A HUGE NIGHTMARE FOR NANCY PELOSI WHO SAID THE PATHWAY FOR VICTORY RUNS THROUGH CALIFORNIA. I TALKED TO DEMOCRATIC CANDIDATES THAT THEY HAVE HAND PICKED AND THEY'RE NOT READY TO VOCALIZE THEIR SUPPORT FOR A POTENTIAL SPEAKER PELOSI RUN IN
