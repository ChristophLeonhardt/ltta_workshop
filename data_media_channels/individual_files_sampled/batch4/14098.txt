all right a few days ago I chatted with you all about this ridiculous issue boiling here in America known as cultural appropriation well the supreme cultural appropriator white rapper Eminem is the subject of my rant today my target is on his head today because he's moved away from his yapping Chihuahua like antics annoying the crap out of Trump supporters as he runs his mouth about our president and he's now attacking the NRA and its members saying that we love our guns more than we love our children which would normally be very offensive if it weren't so utterly ridiculous but even that's not what's so irritating about this what's so annoying to me is the level of stupidity it takes to run your mouth like this when you've written so many songs glorifying guns and about killing people so let's go over some of his lyrics and don't worry our editors have been hard at work bleeping my video so you don't have to put your headphones in mom I apologize in advance I don't normally use this language unless I'm on the 405 in traffic and for those of you not familiar with California that is a freeway slash perpetual parking lot here in LA okay so exhibit number one is his song murder murder from his 1997 album Slim Shady the lyrics are as follows left the keys by the van with a gat in each hand went up in Eastland and shot a policeman a pulley a peace pit plan if a citizen by stands that is in my hands here's your lifespan by the way a gat as a pistol it's short for Gatling gun Lex ecologist placed the inception of the term around the Prohibition era so there's a little history lesson for you alright exhibit number two on his 1999 record appropriately titled kill you he brainstorms about various ways to commit murder including this warning to a woman put your hands down I ain't gonna shoot you i'ma pull you to this bullet and put it through you nice right his mother must be so proud and then there's this get off of his 2002 album where he says to a friend about his girlfriend I'm gonna kill this I'm gonna kill her I'm going to jail cuz I'm gonna kill this and yet in another song this one from 2004 called one shot two shot he says one shot two shot three shots four shots all I hear is gunshots this is where the fun stops bodies drop hit the floor and musics off party stops everybody hit the door somebody's looking shots off and I saved the best for last from his rap group d12 song get my gun he says I'm trying to pull the trigger it's stuck my is all jammed come on you being good for nothing my piece of shoot ah yeah what up say that again shot the bullet missed hit a brick pounced off it ricocheted back in his chin went through his on its way back hit his friend payback homie don't play that this spin to be on I told you to leave that alone or I'm gonna get my gun and it's a shame I'm too drunk to even aim and lyrics gosh I need to wash my mouth out with soap oh by the way Eminem NRA members are the most responsible gun owners in the country we don't mix guns and alcohol but then again if I started listing off the differences between Eminem and the NRA we would be here all night so I will refrain but you see what I'm saying here Eminem is one of the last people who should ever be running his mouth but I bet you he will and by the way he has a cute little pair of felonies carrying a concealed weapon without a license and assault with a deadly weapon so there you go thanks so much for watching everybody I'm Amanda head for the rebel you enjoyed my commentary and want to hear more from all of us here at the rebel subscribe to our premium content at WWWE a forward slash OHS and make sure you're following us on facebook and twitter and very important download our new app for the rebel media on the App Store just one little click and you will have access to all of our latest videos and your favorite rebel shows thanks so much for watching I'm Amanda head for the rebel
