If you can't afford your medication, AstraZeneca may be able to help. Tucker: THE LEFT WASN'T GOING TO LET IG'S REPORT GO UNANSWERED. EARLIER TODAY NEW YORK ATTORNEY GENERAL BARBARA UNDERWOOD ANNOUNCED NEW LAWSUIT AGAINST THE TRUMP FOUNDATION IN NEW YORK. THE SUIT SEEKS TO DESOLVE THE ORGANIZATION AND BAN TRUMP AS WELL AS HIS THREE CHILDREN FROM SERVING ON ANY NONPROFIT. DONALD TRUMP JR. IS ONE OF THE PEOPLE TARGETED BY THAT LAWSUIT AND HE JOINS US TONIGHT. DONALD TRUMP JR., THANKS FOR JOINING US. GOOD TO BE WITH YOU, TUCKER. HOW ARE YOU? Tucker: I'M DOING GREAT. BEFORE I ASK YOU ABOUT THE SUIT OF THE NONPROFIT. LET ME GET YOUR TAKE ON THE INSPECTOR GENERAL REPORT YOU SAW TODAY. PRETTY INCREDIBLE. I LOOK AT THE ATTORNEY GENERAL HR AT MAJOR CORPORATION, RIGHT? THEY'RE NOT REALLY THERE TO PROTECT THE INDIVIDUALS. THEY ARE THERE TO PROTECT THE CORPORATION. AS DAMNING AS IT WAS. IT PROBABLY DOESN'T GO FAR ENOUGH AS IT RELATES TO WHAT WAS REALLY GOING ON. I THINK REAL AMERICA, AND WHAT I HAVE BEEN SAYING FOR WEEKS AND LAST TIME I WAS ON WITH YOU, REAL AMERICA SEES WHAT'S GOING ON HERE. THEY SEE THAT THESE PHONY PLAYERS AT THE TOP OF THE FBI, NOT THE RANK AND FILE. NOT THE BOOTS ON THE GROUND. THE GUYS DOING THE REAL WORK. THEY SAID THESE LAWYERS THAT NEVER WENT THROUGH THOSE THINGS, HAD NEVER STARTED DOWN AT THE BOTTOM. THESE LAWYERS AT THE TOP WERE TRYING TO INFLUENCE AN ELECTION AND THEN UNDERMINE A PRESIDENCY. I LOOK AT JAMES COMEY. IT'S LIKE THE LIBERAL VERSION OF A SORORITY SISTER. LIKE IT'S PRETTY RIDICULOUS AT THIS POINT. WHEN I SEE WHAT'S GONE ON, I THINK I SEE WHAT EVERYONE ELSE IN AMERICA IS SEEING AND THEY SHOULD BE DISGUSTED. Tucker: IF YOU ARE A RIGHT OF CENTER PERSON NOT YOU SPECIFICALLY ANY PERSON AND YOU WERE CAUGHT UP IN AN FBI INVESTIGATION, WOULDN'T YOU WANT TO KNOW THAT THE MAN IDENTIFIED AS FBI LAWYER NUMBER TWO WASN'T ON YOUR INVESTIGATION? I THINK THAT WOULD BE KIND OF IMPORTANT. Tucker: WHY DON'T WE KNOW HIS NAME AND SHOULDN'T WE KNOW HIS NAME. THAT'S WHAT I DON'T UNDERSTAND. ALL OF THIS STUFF GOING ON. WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE STUFF AND I HAVE TALKED ABOUT IT WITH YOU ON YOUR SHOW. THE STUFF I HAVE GONE THROUGH OVER THE LAST 18 MONTHS, WHETHER IT BE ABOUT THE RUSSIA INVESTIGATION. IT'S THE BIGGEST DEAL 25 HOURS OF TESTIMONY IN FRONT OF CONGRESS. HILLARY CLINTON DOES 10 FOR BENGHAZI AND, GUESS WHAT? WHEN SHE AND THE DNC TEAM UP TO PAY A FOREIGN AGENT TO WORK WITH RUSSIA TO COMPILE A FAKE DOSSIER AND SPEND MILLIONS OF DOLLARS TO DO THIS THING, ALL OF WHICH HAS BEEN DEBUNKED. NONE OF IT PROVEN. CHASING THIS THING FOR TWO YEARS. NOTHING. LITERALLY NOTHING HAPPENS. SO I THINK IT JUST SLOWS THE FLAGRANT DOUBLE STANDARD. IF YOU ARE EVEN CENTER LET ALONE RIGHT OF CENTER YOU WOULD BE GETTING THE SAME THING. IF YOU ARE THE UBER LEFT, YOU CAN GET AWAY WITH AND DO WITH WHATEVER YOU WANT BECAUSE THERE IS NO ACCOUNTABILITY THERE. I THINK REAL PEOPLE, AGAIN, ARE STARTING TO SEE IT THEY SHOULD BE DISGUSTED. Tucker: SO Tucker: NEW YORK ATTORNEY GENERAL ANNOUNCED A SUIT AGAINST THE CLINTON FOUNDATION FOR I'M SORRY, I GOT THAT WRONG AGAINST THE TRUMP FOUNDATION. RIGHT. Tucker: AND YOU ARE NAMED IN IT. OF COURSE. Tucker: WHAT'S YOUR REACTION TO THAT. LISTEN, IT'S NONSENSE. IN THE END THIS IS A CHARITABLE THAT WAS FUNDED 50% BY MY FATHER'S OWN MONEY TO GO INTO GOOD DEESDZ. IT'S SOMETHING THAT ERIC SNEIDERMAN BEFORE HE WENT DOWN IN A BALL OF FLAMES AS ONE OF THE LEADERS OF THE ORIGINAL ME TOO MOVEMENT, YOU KNOW, WAS WORKING ON FOR YEARS WHERE IS HE RIGHT NOW? HE COULDN'T FOLLOW THROUGH. THEY DO THIS ON THE DAY THE IG REPORT TO BE ABLE TO DOMINATE THE NEWS CYCLE. GUESS WHAT? MOST OF THE MEDIA WILL CARRY BAGGAGE AND RUN WITH IT LIKE IT'S A BIG THING. IT REALLY ISN'T. THIS IS A MONEY THAT WENT TO GOOD AND CHARITABLE CAUSES. HALF OF WHICH WAS FUNDED ZERO EXPENSE RATIO. DIDN'T HAVE EMPLOYEES. WASN'T SENDING PEOPLE ON G-5S ALL OVER THE WORLD LIKE THE CLINTON FOUNDATION AT 90% EXPENSE RATIO. THAT'S THE STANDARD AND THE DOUBLE STANDARD BY WHICH WE HAVE TO LIVE AND WE'LL KEEP DOING THAT AND KEEP FIGHTING. WE WILL DO WHAT WE HAVE TO DO. BUT I THINK WHAT MY FATHER IS DOING IS DOING AN AMAZING JOB IN WASHINGTON, D.C. HE IS SHOWING THIS FLAGRANT DOUBLE STANDARD. IS HE HIGHLIGHTING IT TO THE PEOPLE. THEY ARE SEEING IT. THEY ARE FED UP. AND THEY ARE WATCHING HIM WIN DESPITE ALL OF THE NOISE. DESPITE ALL OF THE OBSTRUCTION. DESPITE ALL OF THE HYSTERIA ABOUT ANYTHING THAT DONALD TRUMP IS. I MEAN, I WATCHED LAST WEEK COMING FROM SINGAPORE AND WATCHING ALL THESE PEOPLE. THERE ARE PEOPLE ON THE LEFT I ALMOST FEEL AS THOUGH THEY WERE HOPING FOR A NUCLEAR WAR BECAUSE THEN THEY COULD SAY SEE, TRUMP FAILED. IT'S REALLY RIDICULOUS, TUCKER. IT'S GONE TOO FAR. Tucker: SO JUST TO GO BACK TO THE SUIT. I JUST WANT TO GET MY HEAD AROUND IT. IS THE IMPLICATION OR THE CLAIM THAT YOU GOT RICH BECAUSE YOU'RE NAMED IN IT, THAT YOU GOT RICH BY YOUR AFFILIATION WITH A NONPROFIT? DID YOU GET RICH. I'M NOT SURE WHAT THE CLAIM IS THE CLAIM IS THERE IS SOMEHOW MISMANAGEMENT. IN THE END THERE WERE NO SALARIES PAID. THERE IS NO EXPENSE. THERE ARE NO PAID MEMBERS OF THIS THING. WE'RE SITTING THERE AS ESSENTIALLY A BOARD TO SEE THAT THE MONEY THAT HE IS PUTTING IN THERE IS GOING OUT TO OTHER CHARITABLE CAUSES. THAT'S ALL IT IS. THIS ISN'T THE CLINTON FOUNDATION WHERE THEY ARE TAKING MONEY FROM FOREIGN GOVERNMENTS WHO ARE THEN GIVING TO THEIR FRIENDS TO FLY AROUND ON G-5S FOR PROJECTS THAT NEVER MATERIALIZE. YOU KNOW, IT'S REAL A LOT DIFFERENT. YOU CAN SEE A LIST OF ALL THE CHARITIES I WENT. TO SAY HALF OF THEM ARE VETERANS CHARITIES. Tucker: TO BE CLEAR, YOU NEVER TOOK A SALARY. I HAVE NEVER TAKEN A CENT FROM IT, NO. NEITHER ABOUT D. MY BROTHER, DID MY SISTER AND NEITHER DID MY FATHER. Tucker: I'M EVEN MORE CONFUSED. AS AM I. WE ARE USED TO IT BY NOW.
