because i had read the book I'd love the

8
00:00:15,330 --> 00:00:17,220

9
00:00:17,220 --> 00:00:19,109
a gap between how much I would be<font color="#CCCCCC"> able</font>

10

20
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:42,600
flick then I got all kind of weird about

21
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:44,730
it I was literally typing on my friend

22
00:00:44,730 --> 00:00:46,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">Ella's facebook LM on two dimension</font>

32
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:03,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">started getting all stressed about it</font>

33
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:04,890
mentally and it was just a chick flick

34
00:01:04,890 --> 00:01:09,540

35
00:01:09,540 --> 00:01:10,860
