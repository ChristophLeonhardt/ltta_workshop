IN 2010 HE TOOK IT FOR OUTLINING

29
00:00:47,498 --> 00:00:48,666
A DIFFERENT PRIORITY.

30
00:00:48,666 --> 00:00:49,500
>> OUR TOP POLITICAL PRIORITY

31
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:51,902

GARLAND TO THE COURT, HE

37
00:01:02,313 --> 00:01:04,282
DECLINED TO CONSIDER HIM.

38
00:01:04,282 --> 00:01:05,016
>> THE AMERICAN PEOPLE NEED TO

39
00:01:05,016 --> 00:01:06,851
WEIGH IN AND DECIDE WHO'S GOING

40
00:01:06,851 --> 00:01:09,053

>> HE IS REASONABLY ABLE TO

48
00:01:20,765 --> 00:01:22,900
CONTROL HIS PEOPLE.

49
00:01:22,900 --> 00:01:24,669
THAT IN ITSELF IS SOMETHING TO

50
00:01:24,669 --> 00:01:25,770
BE CREDITED WITH.

51
00:01:25,770 --> 00:01:27,772
>> HE'S ALSO THE RARE REPUBLICAN

52
00:01:27,772 --> 00:01:29,807
WHO DARES TO SHARE LAUGHS IN

53
00:01:29,807 --> 00:01:33,110
PUBLIC WITH HIS DEMOCRATIC

54
00:01:33,110 --> 00:01:33,544
COUNTERPARTS.

55
00:01:33,544 --> 00:01:34,278
>> HE PLAYS HIS CARDS CLOSE TO

56
00:01:34,278 --> 00:01:35,479
HIS CHEST BUT HE WILL JUST SIT

57
00:01:35,479 --> 00:01:37,481
THERE AND LISTEN AND LISTEN AND

58
00:01:37,481 --> 00:01:38,249
LISTEN.

59
00:01:38,249 --> 00:01:39,150
>> SOMETIMES REPUBLICANS BREAK

60
00:01:39,150 --> 00:01:40,718
RANKS, LIKE SENATOR TED CRUZ WHO

61
00:01:40,718 --> 00:01:41,986
ONCE CALLED McCONNELL OUT

62
00:01:41,986 --> 00:01:44,522
ABOUT THE EXPORT-IMPORT BANK.

63
00:01:44,522 --> 00:01:45,356
>> I CANNOT BELIEVE HE WOULD

64
00:01:45,356 --> 00:01:47,992
TELL A FLAT OUT LIE.

65
00:01:47,992 --> 00:01:48,893
>> THERE ARE ALSO REPUBLICAN

66
00:01:48,893 --> 00:01:50,661
CANDIDATES WHO TRY TO CAPITALIZE

67
00:01:50,661 --> 00:01:52,330
ON ANTI-McCONNELL SENTIMENT.

68
00:01:52,330 --> 00:01:55,466
>> ONE OF MY GOALS AS U.S.

69
00:01:55,466 --> 00:01:56,233
SENATOR WILL BE TO DITCH COCAINE

70
00:01:56,233 --> 00:01:57,835
MITCH.

71
00:01:57,835 --> 00:01:58,569
>> IN D.C. THERE'S NOT MUCH OF

72
00:01:58,569 --> 00:02:01,472
AN APPETITE TO REMOVE THE

73
00:02:01,472 --> 00:02:02,073
REPUBLICAN LEADER.

74
00:02:02,073 --> 00:02:03,708
>> HE'S BEEN RIGHT SO MANY TIMES

75
00:02:03,708 --> 00:02:04,475
SO IT BUILDS CONFIDENCE.

76
00:02:04,475 --> 00:02:07,078
>> BUT ON THIS, THE DAY THAT

77
00:02:07,078 --> 00:02:09,113
McCONNELL FINALLY BROKE THE

78
00:02:09,113 --> 00:02:10,214
RECORD, HIS OWN MEMBERS AREN'T

79
00:02:10,214 --> 00:02:11,949
LISTENING TO HIM.

80
00:02:11,949 --> 00:02:12,616
MULTIPLE REPUBLICAN SENATORS

81
00:02:12,616 --> 00:02:16,320
HAVE TOLD ME THAT TODAY AT LUNCH

82
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:18,222
McCONNELL IMPLORED REPUBLICANS

83
00:02:18,222 --> 00:02:20,424
TO STOP BLOCKING REPUBLICAN

84
00:02:20,424 --> 00:02:21,459
AMENDMENTS AND MULTIPLE

85
00:02:21,459 --> 00:02:22,860
REPUBLICAN SENATORS PROCEEDED TO

00:02:22,860 --> 00:00:00,000
LEAVE LUNCH AND BLOCK EACH
