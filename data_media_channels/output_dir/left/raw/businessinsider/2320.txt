00:00:12,019 --> 00:00:15,030
welcome back let's<font color="#E5E5E5"> get right to it is</font>

2
00:00:15,030 --> 00:00:17,340
Congress really<font color="#E5E5E5"> so corrupt that Wall</font>

3
00:00:17,340 --> 00:00:19,439
Street calls the shots the short answer

4
00:00:19,439 --> 00:00:22,410
is yes Congress really is so corrupt and

5
00:00:22,410 --> 00:00:24,210
Wall Street really does call the shots

6
00:00:24,210 --> 00:00:26,699
time after time we've seen attempts<font color="#E5E5E5"> at</font>

7
00:00:26,699 --> 00:00:29,910
financial regulation reform crushed<font color="#CCCCCC"> by</font>

8
00:00:29,910 --> 00:00:32,189
the Wall Street lobby how exactly<font color="#CCCCCC"> does</font>

9
00:00:32,189 --> 00:00:34,559
it do this mainly by appealing to the

10
00:00:34,559 --> 00:00:36,660
<font color="#CCCCCC">aspirations of people on Capitol Hill</font>

11
00:00:36,660 --> 00:00:40,290
the Capitol<font color="#CCCCCC"> Hill's staff particularly in</font>

12
00:00:40,290 --> 00:00:44,370
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Banking Committee all aspire to work</font>

13
00:00:44,370 --> 00:00:47,340
for Wall Street firms or lobbyists that

14
00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:49,289
work for Wall Street firms as long as

15
00:00:49,289 --> 00:00:51,120
that aspiration is dominant in their

16
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:52,920
lives there's no way they're going to do

17
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:55,530
<font color="#CCCCCC">anything that seriously works against</font>

18
00:00:55,530 --> 00:00:59,489
the interests of banks of large

19
00:00:59,489 --> 00:01:02,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">insurance companies were basically stuck</font>

20
00:01:02,070 --> 00:01:05,030
there there are three types of<font color="#E5E5E5"> people in</font>

21
00:01:05,030 --> 00:01:07,619
Washington DC<font color="#E5E5E5"> who are interested in the</font>

22
00:01:07,619 --> 00:01:10,110
financial system the first type are

23
00:01:10,110 --> 00:01:12,479
people who someday want to go work<font color="#E5E5E5"> for a</font>

24
00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:15,299
Wall Street firm those people<font color="#CCCCCC"> obviously</font>

25
00:01:15,299 --> 00:01:18,450
have a conflict<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> interest the second</font>

26
00:01:18,450 --> 00:01:20,130
type are people who used to<font color="#CCCCCC"> work for</font>

27
00:01:20,130 --> 00:01:21,990
Wall Street firm and plan on going back

28
00:01:21,990 --> 00:01:24,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's a revolving door and they are</font>

29
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:26,520
also dangerous the third type are the

30
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:28,530
people who<font color="#CCCCCC"> used to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> work for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a Wall</font>

31
00:01:28,530 --> 00:01:30,240
Street firm and never want to go back

32
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:31,770
it's important that we<font color="#E5E5E5"> make the</font>

33
00:01:31,770 --> 00:01:33,810
distinction<font color="#E5E5E5"> between those two types of</font>

34
00:01:33,810 --> 00:01:35,759
<font color="#CCCCCC">people everybody gets very upset when</font>

35
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:37,590
they see an investment banker go to work

36
00:01:37,590 --> 00:01:39,990
for<font color="#E5E5E5"> government the question isn't so</font>

37
00:01:39,990 --> 00:01:42,689
much whether it's dangerous just<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

38
00:01:42,689 --> 00:01:44,280
allow investment bankers in government

39
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:46,950
it's really whether it's not to allow

40
00:01:46,950 --> 00:01:48,600
government workers to go back to

41
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:50,340
investment banking there are ways to

42
00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:53,280
address us and we need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do that so</font>

43
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:55,460
let's move on in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the next</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> question</font>

44
00:01:55,460 --> 00:01:57,689
investment bankers who arguably might

45
00:01:57,689 --> 00:01:59,369
actually work for<font color="#CCCCCC"> the government I'm</font>

46
00:01:59,369 --> 00:02:01,290
talking about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the people at AIG</font>

47
00:02:01,290 --> 00:02:03,360
financial products<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's just revealed</font>

48
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:05,909
that they're about to pay out another

49
00:02:05,909 --> 00:02:08,729
<font color="#E5E5E5">100 million dollars in bonuses is this</font>

50
00:02:08,729 --> 00:02:11,489
outrageous of course it is this is these

51
00:02:11,489 --> 00:02:13,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">are people who work for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a company</font>

52
00:02:13,410 --> 00:02:15,930
is owned in large part by the US

53
00:02:15,930 --> 00:02:19,050
taxpayer it would be bankrupt it would

54
00:02:19,050 --> 00:02:20,700
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> been bankrupt a year and a half ago</font>

55
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:22,320
if<font color="#E5E5E5"> not for the support of the US</font>

56
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:24,510
<font color="#CCCCCC">government it would be bankrupt today if</font>

57
00:02:24,510 --> 00:02:26,490
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> remove that support yet they are</font>

58
00:02:26,490 --> 00:02:29,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">paying millions in bonuses to the very</font>

59
00:02:29,130 --> 00:02:32,460
division that wrecked the company so

60
00:02:32,460 --> 00:02:34,560
what<font color="#E5E5E5"> can we do about this nothing much</font>

61
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:36,510
I'm afraid we've decided that we're not

62
00:02:36,510 --> 00:02:38,400
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to liquidate AIG apparently that</font>

63
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:40,110
was the<font color="#E5E5E5"> original proposition we're going</font>

64
00:02:40,110 --> 00:02:42,120
to bail it out and then destroy<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

65
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:43,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">company apparently we're not going to do</font>

66
00:02:43,740 --> 00:02:45,840
that we're going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> keep it alive so as</font>

67
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:47,370
long<font color="#CCCCCC"> as we're dedicated to the</font>

68
00:02:47,370 --> 00:02:50,340
proposition that AIG must never die then

69
00:02:50,340 --> 00:02:52,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">we have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to keep paying these outrageous</font>

70
00:02:52,620 --> 00:02:55,860
bonuses to people I guess you get the

71
00:02:55,860 --> 00:02:57,780
financial system<font color="#E5E5E5"> and the government you</font>

72
00:02:57,780 --> 00:03:00,780
deserve this has been you ask we answer
