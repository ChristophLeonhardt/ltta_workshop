howdy welcome back to no filter most of us knew that the anti-immigrant rhetoric during Trump's presidential bid would open a can of white supremacist worms but the far right side e ology is even more extreme than expected because at some point while we were all distracted by Trump's scandals his administration in addition to his Fox News cheerleaders slowly moved their goalposts to target legal immigrants let's begin with the most recent example here's Laura Ingraham on Fox News clearly fear-mongering about massive demographic changes thanks to illegal and legal immigration in some parts of the country it does seem like the America that we know and love doesn't exist anymore massive demographic changes have been foisted upon the American people and their changes that none of us have were voted for and most of us don't like from Virginia to California we see stark examples of how radically in some ways the country has changed now much of this is related to both illegal and in some cases legal immigration that of course progressives love yeah that was pretty bad Ingram tried to walk back her statements after receiving backlash by saying her commentary had nothing to do with race here's the thing you can't pretend like your hate for immigrants isn't racially charged when you specifically highlight scary demographic changes in your ramped engram isn't the only person who has gone after legal immigrants there are actual White House officials who have already executed policy and have pending policies that would clamp down on immigrants who enter the country legally Stephen Miller Trump's proud white nationalist advisor was the one who crafted the administration's zero-tolerance immigration policy which separated children from their families as they were seeking asylum at the us-mexico border while much of the conservative narrative insisted that these immigrants were attempting to enter the country illegally evidence showed that many families were blocked from ports of entry which is the legal way of entering the United States as in an asylum seeker even the Center for Immigration Studies an anti immigrant I found this to be criminal and objectionable writing that quote although the US Customs and Border Protection has insisted that asylum seekers pass through ports of entry it has denied potential non Mexican asylum seekers access to the inspection area at ports of entry and left them stranded in Mexico the administration has criminally prosecuted and detained asylum seekers in order to deter others from coming it has separated children from their parents at the border okay when the Center for Immigration Studies write stuff like that you know your administration has gone too far but if you think that was a particularly horrendous moment in Trump's administration keep in mind that Stephen Miller isn't done yet NBC News broke the story of what Miller currently has up his sleeve the White House is now finalizing a proposal they don't need to go through Congress to get this done they can just do this through a rulemaking this would limit those immigrants from getting that citizenship or those green cards if they've ever been on public benefits that includes Obama care it includes child's health insurance it includes food stamps it includes a lot of programs that a lot that immigrants especially those working and low-wage jobs would need just to support their families and again these aren't illegal immigrants these are people lawfully in the United States trying to get status either as citizens or as legal permanent residents so let me just summarize if you are in the country legally with a green card and you are doing everything you can to legally obtain full citizenship in the United States Stephen Miller is doing everything he can to prevent that from happening on a recent episode of The Young Turks I shared more on this story these are people who are currently in the US with visas or with green cards they're individuals who are working paying taxes and so the Trump administration specifically Stephen Miller wants to make it impossible for them to ever gain citizenship I want to be clear for the for the second time these are people who are in the country legally they have green cards they are working they're paying taxes and being repetitive on purpose because I want to make sure everyone understands what's happening here Miller isn't our Miller is going to exploit this myth and it is a myth that undocumented immigrants are mooching off welfare programs to drum up support for his policy among conservatives but illegal immigrants do not qualify for federal government programs only people in the country legally do again these are people who pay taxes so they're entitled to help if they qualify for it NBC highlighted the story of a Haitian man named Louie Charles who has a green card owns a home and pays taxes but despite working 80 hours a week as a nursing assistant Charles had to use public programs to support his disabled daughter adult daughter because health care in this country is so outrageously expensive Charles is doing everything he can to legally gain full citizenship in America but under Miller's proposal his chances are slim to none and keep in mind that under Trump getting a green card is already much more difficult according to NBC News data from the first quarter of fiscal year 2018 indicates that the administration is on track for a decline in immigrants granted green cards by 20% I want to share data dispelling the myth that people in the country illegally abuse taxpayer-funded government programs they don't because they can't on a state level sometimes undocumented immigrants can qualify for programs in that state but according to econo fact org on a federal level unauthorized immigrants are ineligible for most major federally funded safety net programs including Temporary Assistance for Needy Families the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program and Supplemental Security income otherwise known as SSI they are also prohibited from non-emergency Medicaid the Children's Health Insurance Program and the Medicare program undocumented immigrants are not eligible to receive insurance subsidies under the Affordable Care Act or to participate in the ACA insurance exchanges I'm not done yet undocumented immigrants are not eligible to receive Social Security benefits even though many contribute 12 billion dollars a year to the system the only time federal taxpayers spent any money on undocumented immigrants is when they end up in emergency rooms which is why it's so important to pass comprehensive immigration reform so they can access preventative care instead of outrageously costly emergency services when looking at legal immigrants you'll see that even they don't abuse the system the way Trump's administration would have you believe in fact a study by the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities found that the biggest beneficiaries of government safety net of the government safety net are working-class whites the study indicates that of all working age adults without college degrees lifted out of poverty by safety net programs half are white while nearly a quarter are black only 1/5 1/5 or Hispanic remember that we're talking about people who are in the country legally they qualify for these programs this data completely disproves the narrative that Hispanics rely heavily on government programs the national account the National Academy of Sciences conducted its own immigration study in I'm sorry 2016 and found that less than 50 percent of legal immigrant households used Medicaid and food assistance but we have some more data for you when it comes to food assistance twenty three point nine percent of native-born Americans rely on the program while only twenty-one point five percent of immigrants do six point six percent of native-born Americans rely on affordable housing programs while only two point three percent of legal immigrants do and twenty five point two percent of native-born Americans rely on Medicaid while twenty one point five percent of legal immigrants - look I'm not sharing these numbers to demonize anyone weatherboard in the United States or someplace else we're talking about people who are here legally these are our fellow Americans and I find it our responsibility to look out for our country and help pull people out of poverty and into opportunity but we cannot and I will not allow this myth regarding immigrants to continue spreading like wildfire by bad actors like Stephen Miller it's an attempt to divide us through fear and hatred I believe Americans are far better than that and we shouldn't allow the Trump administration to manipulate us hey everyone I hope you enjoyed my show no filter and I actually film it every single Monday at 1:30 Pacific 4:30 Eastern so you can check it out live on YouTube TV just search for TYT
