TRUMP VISITED GIVING EVERY CHILD A START IN LIFE. AND I LOVE TALKING ABOUT THE FLOOD OF OPIOIDS, PATRICK MORRISEY AND HIS FAMILY LOBBYING IN WASHINGTON, D.C., CARDINAL HEALTH, NOT OUR STATE TO BIRD, IT IS THE PUSHER OF ALL OF THESE PILLS. HE AND HIS FAMILY LOBBYING FIRM HAVE MADE MILLIONS AND MILLIONS IN HIS 18 YEARS AS A D.C. LOBBYIST AND HILL STAFFORD. THEY HAVE FLOODED OUR STATE WITH THESE PAIN PILLS THAT HAVE DEVASTATED PEOPLE IN WEST VIRGINIA. IF YOU WANT TO SEE WHAT THE PROBLEM IS, IT IS THE PILL PUSHERS AND PATRICK MORRISEY IS REPRESENTING THOSE PEOPLE FOR YEARS AND MADE MILLIONS. Bret: OUR FIRST BELL OF THE EVENING, BUT MR. MORRISEY. THERE HE GOES YET AGAIN, DID YOUR MOM EVER TELL YOU THAT WE SHOULD WASH YOUR MOUTH OUT WITH SOAP WITH THOSE LIES? I'LL TELL YOU WHAT, OBVIOUSLY NOT ONLY PEOPLE KNOW THAT WE DID NOT WORK ON THOSE ISSUES IN THE PRIVATE SECTOR, BUT NO ONE HAS DONE MORE TO GO AFTER THE OPIOID EPIDEMIC, SUING, GOING AFTER $78 MILLION IN DAMAGES FROM THE PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANIES, RECENTLY WE WENT AFTER THE DEA, BECAUSE THAT FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AGENCY HAD BEEN BLANKETING THE STATE, RUBBER-STAMPING THE APPLICATIONS COMING IN, FLOODING WEST VIRGINIA WITH PILLS. WE WENT AFTER IT AND ARE PUTTING AN END TO THAT. EDUCATION IN THE SCHOOLS, AND OBVIOUSLY WE ARE GOING AFTER TREATMENT AS WELL. BECAUSE WE HAVE TO ADDRESS PEOPLE'S NEEDS IN THEIR HEADS AND THEIR HEARTS. I WILL CONCLUDE ON THIS NOTE, ALL OF US INCLUDING ME AND MY FAMILY, WE HAVE SEEN ISSUES WITH ADDICTION. THERE IS NO ONE HERE TONIGHT THAT HAS NOT FELT IT. AND FOR SOMEONE LIKE EVAN JENKINS TO KEEP THE POLITICAL DIALOGUE TO SAY THAT THINGS ARE NOT TRUE TO HIDE HIS DEEP LIBERAL BACKGROUND IS VERY SAD. Bret: MR. MORRISEY I UNDERSTAND, BUT AS ATTORNEY GENERAL YOU DID SEE WITH THE MAJOR PILL DISTRIBUTOR, BUT AT THE SAME TIME YOUR WIFE WAS LOBBYING FOR THAT PILL DISTRIBUTOR PERIOD IS THAT NOT A CONFLICT OF INTEREST? WE HAVE HANDLED EVERYTHING EXACTLY RIGHT, I THINK MOST PEOPLE IN THE STATE WOULD SAY THAT WE HAVE A MORE EFFECTIVE TAKING ON THE OPIOID EPIDEMIC THAN ANYONE. I NOTE WHEN I GOT INTO OFFICE THERE WAS NO SUBSTANCE ABUSE FIGHTING UNIT IN THE STATE. WE HAVE TURNED THINGS AROUND HER TO THE OTHER POINT, YOU CITED IT, THE STATISTICS FROM ON THE WATCH AS GOVERNOR. HE WAS SLEEPING AT THE SWITCH
