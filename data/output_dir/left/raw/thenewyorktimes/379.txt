1
00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:07,140
Here we are, in a very unusual
space, with six main windows

2
00:00:07,140 --> 00:00:09,560
into neighboring cells.
If you look straight up

3
00:00:09,560 --> 00:00:11,909
or straight down, everything
looks about normal.

4
00:00:11,909 --> 00:00:15,259
The cells above and below us
are just like the ones we're in.

5
00:00:15,269 --> 00:00:18,450
Let's move downward and 
follow this infinite column of cells

6
00:00:18,450 --> 00:00:20,330
as we watch more cells
come into view.

7
00:00:20,330 --> 00:00:22,870
In this direction, space behaves
the way we're used to in

8
00:00:22,870 --> 00:00:26,210
everyday life â€” it's euclidean.
But what about the cells

9
00:00:26,210 --> 00:00:28,720
around you to the side?
You'll notice something

10
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:31,730
different going on.
The four cells directly around you look

11
00:00:31,730 --> 00:00:34,127
pretty similar to the
one you're in, but as you look

12
00:00:34,127 --> 00:00:37,670
towards the horizon, they appear
to become taller and narrower.

13
00:00:37,670 --> 00:00:42,170
Let's go towards the horizon and 
see what shape these cells actually are.

14
00:00:42,170 --> 00:00:44,999
You could think of this as the
cells themselves warping

15
00:00:44,999 --> 00:00:47,500
and changing shape as we move.
But the way I think of it,

16
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:50,399
and the way this model was
programmed, has all cells as

17
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:54,400
being the same, unchanging shape
to begin with, and it's space itself

18
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:58,280
that is warped.
Along the horizontal plane,

19
00:00:58,280 --> 00:01:02,010
this space is hyperbolic.
It's curved in such a way that

20
00:01:02,010 --> 00:01:05,159
there's more room to fit more
cells, and that's why they

21
00:01:05,159 --> 00:01:09,360
appear squished from afar.
Now let's see what space looks like

22
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:14,140
when it's curved hyperbolically 
in all directions equally.

23
00:01:19,510 --> 00:01:22,759
As we move towards the horizon,
every cell is still the same,

24
00:01:22,759 --> 00:01:25,299
but rather than there being
just more room horizontally

25
00:01:25,299 --> 00:01:28,090
for more cells, making them appear
thinner, there's more room vertically

26
00:01:28,090 --> 00:01:32,419
as well, making them appear smaller 
in height than they really are.

27
00:01:32,419 --> 00:01:35,780
In the euclidean space we're used to, 
only four cubes can fit around one edge

28
00:01:35,780 --> 00:01:40,180
or four square cornered rooms.
But here in hyperbolic space,

29
00:01:40,180 --> 00:01:43,970
we can fit six cube-shaped rooms
around a single column.

30
00:01:43,970 --> 00:01:46,810
Let's go back to the space that's 
hyperbolic in just two directions

31
00:01:46,810 --> 00:01:50,019
and euclidean in the third.
The horizontal beams

32
00:01:50,019 --> 00:01:53,949
connect four cells as we'd 
expect from euclidean space.

33
00:01:53,950 --> 00:01:57,829
The vertical beams, on the other
hand, connect six cells.

34
00:01:57,829 --> 00:02:02,070
Let's start in this olive green cell 
and move around one of the columns.

35
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:05,429
First, we move straight into
a neighboring teal cell.

36
00:02:05,429 --> 00:02:08,440
At the center, we'll turn left 
90 degrees and go straight into

37
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:13,950
the sky blue cell.
From the center of this one,

38
00:02:13,950 --> 00:02:20,170
we'll make another 90 degree left turn 
to move into the light peach cell.

39
00:02:20,170 --> 00:02:24,039
From there, 90 degrees brings us
not to the original olive green cell,

40
00:02:24,039 --> 00:02:29,970
but this coral orange cell.
Another 90 degree left, and

41
00:02:29,970 --> 00:02:35,909
we're heading into the deep red cell.
And finally, our last turn,

42
00:02:35,909 --> 00:02:41,280
will bring us back to the 
olive green cell we started in.

43
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:44,340
The path we took around
that column was a regular

44
00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:48,440
hexagon with six right angles.
And that's the kind of thing that

45
00:02:48,440 --> 00:00:00,000
can happen when your 
space is curved.
