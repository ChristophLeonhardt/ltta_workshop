There’s a lot of talk
that the new Supreme Court,
one with two
Trump justices on it,
might overturn Roe v. Wade.
So the court can’t just
wake up one morning and say,
we’re overruling
Roe v. Wade.
I think supporters
of abortion rights
are right to be nervous,
but they’re maybe not
exactly right about
how to be nervous,
what to be nervous about.
It’s a shorthand, sure,
to say Roe v. Wade can
be overruled,
but that’s not the only,
or even the
most likely, outcome.
Let me take you through
the possible scenarios.
Let’s call the first
category the nuclear options.
These are the most extreme
and, therefore,
least likely scenarios.
The first one would
flip Roe on its head.
Roe says there’s a
constitutional right
to abortion.
The court could say the
Constitution prohibits
abortion in the interest
of protecting fetal life.
That would suggest that fetal
life is like any other life,
so that taking it
away would be murder.
So if the court were to go in
that very unlikely direction,
abortion would be outlawed
across the nation,
and women could
not get abortions
in the United States legally.
A second nuclear option
would be for the court
to do away with the right
to privacy established
in a case called
Griswold in 1965.
“The individual is entitled
to some private sector.”
That right to privacy is the
foundation for Roe v. Wade.
If the right to
privacy goes,
it would do away with the
basis for Roe v. Wade
and, therefore,
Roe v. Wade itself
and flip the issue
back to the states
and allow states to regulate
abortion as they wish.
The right to privacy
has been, and could be,
the foundation
of many rights,
so I don’t think it’s
likely the court will go
after the right to privacy.
A second possibility, and the
one everyone’s talking about,
is the court could
overrule Roe v. Wade.
Protesters: “Ho, ho,
Roe v. Wade has got to go.
Hey, hey, ho, ho.”
So in a post-Roe world,
you still have a right
to privacy.
But that right to
privacy does not
include a constitutional
right to abortion.
States would be free
to do what they wanted.
And some advocacy groups say
perhaps 22 states could make
abortion illegal entirely.
That’s probably not going
to happen anytime soon.
Protesters: “Hey, hey,
Roe v. Wade
is here to stay.”
Chief Justice John Roberts
is an incrementalist.
He takes things step by step,
and I don’t think
his first impulse
is going to be, let’s overrule
Roe v. Wade when there
are other ways
to get from here
to most of the way there.
The last scenario, and
the most likely one,
is for the court to chip
away at Roe v. Wade.
The court has already
upheld some restrictions
on abortion.
“The 5 to 4 majority
upheld a ban
on performing abortions
in public facilities.”
“The U.S. Supreme Court today
upheld the nationwide ban
on partial-birth abortion.”
“Medication abortion is
now effectively blocked
in Arkansas.”
Much more severe restrictions
on abortion rights
are a perfectly
imaginable scenario when
we have a new Supreme Court.
Here’s how that could happen.
States cannot impose
an undue burden
on women’s right to abortion.
That’s a fairly
malleable standard,
and it wouldn’t be hard
for the Supreme Court
to keep it in place,
but interpret it
slightly differently
and say states
can impose such restrictions.
A couple of years
ago, the court
heard a case from Texas.
And had the court
sustained the Texas law,
the number of clinics in
Texas would have dropped
from about 40 to about 10.
And that could rapidly
diminish the ability of women
to get abortions because
the nearest abortion clinic,
at a minimum, could
be hundreds of miles away.
It’s a little hard to
answer exactly what life
will look like
in a given state
because we’ll have
a patchwork of laws.
But what’s for sure is
that women in red states,
and particularly poor
women in red states,
will have a much harder
time getting abortions
as each successive abortion
restriction is sustained
by a court that
now has a solidly
conservative majority.
