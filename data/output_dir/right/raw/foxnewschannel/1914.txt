1
00:00:00,333 --> 00:00:01,167
>> OKAY.

2
00:00:01,167 --> 00:00:02,368
DO SOME MORE DIGGING OUT THERE

3
00:00:02,368 --> 00:00:05,038
AND WE WILL BE GETTING TO YOU

4
00:00:05,038 --> 00:00:06,205
THROUGH THE EVENING OF THE EARLY

5
00:00:06,205 --> 00:00:06,639
MORNING HOURS.

6
00:00:06,639 --> 00:00:10,410
JOINING US NOW FROM HERE IN OUR

7
00:00:10,410 --> 00:00:11,978
WASHINGTON BUREAU IS RETIRED

8
00:00:11,978 --> 00:00:13,580
LIEUTENANT COLONEL DANIEL DAVIS.

9
00:00:13,580 --> 00:00:16,416
HE IS RETIRED AFTER 21 YEARS OF

10
00:00:16,416 --> 00:00:17,984
ACTIVE SERVICE INCLUDING FOUR

11
00:00:17,984 --> 00:00:18,985
TOURS IN COMBAT ZONES.

12
00:00:18,985 --> 00:00:22,188
HE'S NOW A SENIOR FELLOW AND

13
00:00:22,188 --> 00:00:23,189
MILITARY EXPERT AT DEFENSE

14
00:00:23,189 --> 00:00:23,590
PRIORITIES.

15
00:00:23,590 --> 00:00:27,060
GOOD MORNING HERE IN THE EARLY

16
00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:27,694
HOURS.

17
00:00:27,694 --> 00:00:30,763
I AM STRUCK BY THE IMAGE OF THE

18
00:00:30,763 --> 00:00:32,865
AMERICAN FLAG WITH TWO FIRE

19
00:00:32,865 --> 00:00:36,970
ENGINES, IT'S A REMARKABLE

20
00:00:36,970 --> 00:00:38,571
MOMENT FOR AMERICA RIGHT NOW.

21
00:00:38,571 --> 00:00:40,173
>> IT IS.

22
00:00:40,173 --> 00:00:42,108
I ACTUALLY LANDED AT DULLES ONE

23
00:00:42,108 --> 00:00:43,776
TIME AND THERE WERE TWO FIRE

24
00:00:43,776 --> 00:00:45,445
TRUCKS OUT THERE THAT WERE

25
00:00:45,445 --> 00:00:47,180
SHOOTING WATER AS THE PLANE WENT

26
00:00:47,180 --> 00:00:47,547
UNDER IT.

27
00:00:47,547 --> 00:00:50,016
>> THEY LIKE TO DO THAT AS A

28
00:00:50,016 --> 00:00:50,750
SPECIAL GREETING.

29
00:00:50,750 --> 00:00:53,653
>> THEY DO, AND IT MEANS A LOT

30
00:00:53,653 --> 00:00:54,187
TO THEM.

31
00:00:54,187 --> 00:00:55,989
>> BEFORE WE GET TO THE

32
00:00:55,989 --> 00:00:57,056
SUBSTANCE OF ALL OF THIS, AN

33
00:00:57,056 --> 00:00:58,992
IMPORTANT THING THAT WE DON'T

34
00:00:58,992 --> 00:01:01,027
WANT TO FORGET, I SAW YOU

35
00:01:01,027 --> 00:01:03,429
NODDING YOUR HEAD WHEN LELAND

36
00:01:03,429 --> 00:01:08,434
WAS REPORTING ON THE FAMILY OF

37
00:01:08,568 --> 00:01:10,503
AND WE CAN'T FORGET THAT THIS IS

38
00:01:10,503 --> 00:01:11,237
A MURDEROUS REGIME THAT WE ARE

39
00:01:11,237 --> 00:01:13,773
DEALING WITH.

40
00:01:13,773 --> 00:01:15,842
WE ESSENTIALLY KILLED THIS YOUNG

41
00:01:15,842 --> 00:01:16,976
MAN.

42
00:01:16,976 --> 00:01:18,177
HE CAME BACK ALL TORTURED AND

43
00:01:18,177 --> 00:01:19,646
BEATEN DOWN, AND YOU JUST HAVE

44
00:01:19,646 --> 00:01:22,548
TO FEEL FOR HIS FAMILY TONIGHT.

45
00:01:22,548 --> 00:01:25,184
>> YOU DO.

46
00:01:25,184 --> 00:01:27,320
IT'S A TOUCHING MOMENT BECAUSE

47
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:28,388
SOME PEOPLE SAID LIKE IN THE

48
00:01:28,388 --> 00:01:30,189
STATE OF THE UNION ADDRESS, HE

49
00:01:30,189 --> 00:01:33,559
WAS USING IT AS A PROP TO MAKE

50
00:01:33,559 --> 00:01:33,960
HIS POINTS.

51
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:42,201
BUT THIS SHOWS THAT HE GENERALLY

52
00:01:42,201 --> 00:01:42,669
FEELS FOR HIM.

53
00:01:42,669 --> 00:01:44,804
>> SO WE ARE LEARNING TONIGHT

54
00:01:44,804 --> 00:01:48,808
THAT THE SECRETARY OF STATE MADE

55
00:01:48,808 --> 00:01:53,579
THIS PROVISION.

56
00:01:53,579 --> 00:01:55,381
THAT SUGGESTS TO ME THAT THE

57
00:01:55,381 --> 00:01:58,284
UNITED STATES IS PLAYING

58
00:01:58,284 --> 00:01:58,618
OFFENSE.

59
00:01:58,618 --> 00:01:58,951
>> YES.

60
00:01:58,951 --> 00:02:02,188
THEY ARE PLAYING FIRM, AND THEY

61
00:02:02,188 --> 00:02:03,990
ARE NOT GOING TO TALK FOR THE

62
00:02:03,990 --> 00:02:05,191
SAKE OF TALKING.

63
00:02:05,191 --> 00:02:06,392
IT'S A VERY POSITIVE DEVELOPMENT

64
00:02:06,392 --> 00:02:08,294
THAT THEY WERE ABLE TO SAY YES,

65
00:02:08,294 --> 00:02:10,229
THIS IS WHAT WE ARE GOING TO DO.

66
00:02:10,229 --> 00:02:11,731
THEY DIDN'T PLAY AROUND OR PUSH

67
00:02:11,731 --> 00:02:12,865
BACK AND SO IT'S A POSITIVE

68
00:02:12,865 --> 00:02:15,635
DEVELOPMENT AND I HOPE IT

69
00:02:15,635 --> 00:02:18,371
CONTINUES.

70
00:02:18,504 --> 00:02:19,405
LIKE NORTH KOREA MAKE

71
00:02:19,405 --> 00:02:20,873
SUGGESTIONS LIKE THIS, THEY

72
00:02:20,873 --> 00:02:22,675
RELEASED PRISONERS AND THEN THEY

73
00:02:22,675 --> 00:02:23,810
GO TO THE NEGOTIATING TABLE.

74
00:02:23,810 --> 00:02:25,611
I TRIED IT, WE DID ALL THESE

75
00:02:25,611 --> 00:02:28,014
THINGS, BUT WE ARE NOT GETTING

76
00:02:28,014 --> 00:02:28,614
WHAT WE WANT.

77
00:02:28,614 --> 00:02:31,017
I FOUND A FIST AND WALK AWAY.

78
00:02:31,017 --> 00:02:32,618
HOW SKEPTICAL SHOULD WE BE

79
00:02:32,618 --> 00:02:36,389
TONIGHT THAT THIS IS A LITTLE

80
00:02:36,389 --> 00:02:36,889
BIT OF GOODWILL.

81
00:02:36,889 --> 00:02:39,358
>> PRESIDENT TRUMP IS IN THE

82
00:02:39,358 --> 00:02:40,393
POWERFUL DOMINANT DECISION.

83
00:02:40,393 --> 00:02:42,161
TIME IS NOT RUNNING OUT FOR US

84
00:02:42,161 --> 00:02:45,064
BECAUSE WE HAVE ALL THE CARDS.

85
00:02:45,064 --> 00:02:51,204
OUR MILITARY, OUR POWERFUL

86
00:02:51,204 --> 00:02:53,973
MILITARY DETERRENT CAN KEEP US

87
00:02:53,973 --> 00:02:58,077
SAFE HERE BUT HE DOESN'T HAVE

88
00:02:58,077 --> 00:03:00,580
ALL THE TIME IN THE WORLD.

89
00:03:00,580 --> 00:03:02,648
HE CAN SAY, IF THIS ISN'T WORTH

90
00:03:02,648 --> 00:03:06,552
THE WAIT, I CAN WALK AWAY FROM

91
00:03:06,552 --> 00:03:06,853
HERE.

92
00:03:06,853 --> 00:03:12,759
AND WE ARE OKAY.

93
00:03:12,759 --> 00:03:15,194
ARE WE SEEING THE OUTLINES OF

94
00:03:15,194 --> 00:03:16,562
THE TRUNK DOCTRINE?

95
00:03:16,562 --> 00:03:18,965
>> I THINK WE ARE STARTING TO.

96
00:03:18,965 --> 00:03:20,600
HIS INSTINCTS ARE VERY GOOD ON

97
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:21,801
FOREIGN POLICY AND IT HAS BEEN,

98
00:03:21,801 --> 00:03:23,803
AND I HOPE TO SEE HIM CONTINUE

99
00:03:23,803 --> 00:03:24,237
ON WITH THAT.

100
00:03:24,237 --> 00:03:26,706
I THINK HE HAS A CHANCE BECAUSE

101
00:03:26,706 --> 00:03:28,608
OF HIS DISRUPTIVE NATURE, ONE OF

102
00:03:28,608 --> 00:03:30,243
THE REASONS HE GOT ELECTED IN

103
00:03:30,243 --> 00:03:32,011
THE FIRST PLACE, LET'S PLAY A

104
00:03:32,011 --> 00:03:34,013
BIG ROLE IN DIPLOMACY BECAUSE HE

105
00:03:34,013 --> 00:03:35,815
HAS A BIG CHANCE HERE TO

106
00:03:35,815 --> 00:03:36,516
ACCOMPLISH SOMETHING THAT NONE

107
00:03:36,516 --> 00:03:38,184
OF THE 12 PRESIDENTS THAT CAME

108
00:03:38,184 --> 00:03:39,652
BEFORE HIM HAS.

109
00:03:39,652 --> 00:00:00,000
AND THAT IS A TESTAMENT TO HIS
