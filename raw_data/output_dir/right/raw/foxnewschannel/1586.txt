1
00:00:00,532 --> 00:00:02,567
HANDLE THE TRUMP INVESTIGATION

2
00:00:02,567 --> 00:00:04,169
BUT THE CLINTON INVESTIGATION AS

3
00:00:04,302 --> 00:00:05,904
>> Martha: AS YOU SAY, MAYBE

4
00:00:05,904 --> 00:00:06,504
JUST A FEW DAYS AWAY.

5
00:00:06,504 --> 00:00:08,974
GREAT TO SEE YOU TONIGHT.

6
00:00:08,974 --> 00:00:10,375
NOW TO MY EXCLUSIVE INTERVIEW

7
00:00:10,375 --> 00:00:11,109
WITH THE VICE PRESIDENT STARTING

8
00:00:11,109 --> 00:00:14,212
WITH THAT MEETING AT THE

9
00:00:14,212 --> 00:00:14,779
WHITE HOUSE.

10
00:00:14,779 --> 00:00:16,047
>> Martha: I KNOW YOU JUST

11
00:00:16,047 --> 00:00:16,715
CAME FROM LUNCH WITH THE

12
00:00:16,715 --> 00:00:17,849
PRESIDENT AT THE WHITE HOUSE AND

13
00:00:17,849 --> 00:00:20,018
HE HAS ANOTHER MEETING COMING UP

14
00:00:20,018 --> 00:00:20,685
THIS AFTERNOON WITH ROD

15
00:00:20,685 --> 00:00:22,621
ROSENSTEIN AND CHRISTOPHER WRAY.

16
00:00:22,621 --> 00:00:23,788
WHAT DO YOU EXPECT WILL HAPPEN

17
00:00:23,788 --> 00:00:26,124
THERE, DO YOU HAVE ANY INSIGHT

18
00:00:26,124 --> 00:00:26,458
TO THAT?

19
00:00:26,458 --> 00:00:29,494
>> WITH THE REVELATIONS THAT

20
00:00:29,494 --> 00:00:30,261
ARMY CAMPAIGN MAY HAVE BEEN THE

21
00:00:30,261 --> 00:00:32,664
SUBJECT OF SURVEILLANCE BY THE

22
00:00:32,664 --> 00:00:34,799
FBI, THE PRESIDENT I THINK IS

23
00:00:34,799 --> 00:00:35,967
GRATEFUL THAT THE DEPARTMENT OF

24
00:00:35,967 --> 00:00:37,802
JUSTICE IS GOING TO HAVE THE

25
00:00:37,802 --> 00:00:39,237
INSPECTOR GENERAL LOOK INTO IT

26
00:00:39,237 --> 00:00:41,239
AND DETERMINE AND ENSURE THAT

27
00:00:41,239 --> 00:00:43,341
THERE WAS NO SURVEILLANCE DONE

28
00:00:43,341 --> 00:00:47,345
FOR POLITICAL PURPOSES AGAINST

29
00:00:47,345 --> 00:00:47,779
OUR CAMPAIGN.

30
00:00:47,779 --> 00:00:49,948
I THINK IT WOULD BE VERY

31
00:00:49,948 --> 00:00:50,582
TROUBLING TO MILLIONS OF

32
00:00:50,582 --> 00:00:51,816
AMERICANS IF THAT TOOK PLACE,

33
00:00:51,816 --> 00:00:54,819
BUT WE ARE VERY CONFIDENT THAT

34
00:00:54,819 --> 00:00:55,687
AS THE INSPECTOR GENERAL HAS

35
00:00:55,687 --> 00:00:57,322
BEEN DOING THEIR WORK, LOOKING

36
00:00:57,322 --> 00:01:00,558
AT THE CONDUCT OF THE FBI DURING

37
00:01:00,558 --> 00:01:02,260
THAT PERIOD, BY ADDING THEIR

38
00:01:02,260 --> 00:01:03,328
FOCUS TO THIS THAT WE WILL GET

39
00:01:03,328 --> 00:01:04,995
TO THE BOTTOM OF IT BECAUSE THE

40
00:01:04,995 --> 00:01:06,264
AMERICAN PEOPLE HAVE A RIGHT TO

41
00:01:06,264 --> 00:01:06,631
KNOW.

42
00:01:06,631 --> 00:01:07,332
>> Martha: IS THERE ANY

43
00:01:07,332 --> 00:01:09,267
SUGGESTION THAT THERE WILL BE A

44
00:01:09,267 --> 00:01:09,934
SECOND SPECIAL COUNSEL THAT

45
00:01:09,934 --> 00:01:11,970
WOULD BE DEDICATED TO THAT

46
00:01:11,970 --> 00:01:12,804
ENDEAVOR?

47
00:01:12,804 --> 00:01:14,472
>> I THINK AT THIS POINT THE

48
00:01:14,472 --> 00:01:16,007
DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE HAS MADE

49
00:01:16,007 --> 00:01:17,609
IT CLEAR THAT THEY WILL BE

50
00:01:17,609 --> 00:01:19,344
EXPANDING INSPECTOR GENERAL'S

51
00:01:19,344 --> 00:01:21,446
CURRENT INVESTIGATION TO INCLUDE

52
00:01:21,446 --> 00:01:24,215
THESE ALLEGATIONS AND WE DON'T

53
00:01:24,215 --> 00:01:27,018
KNOW WHAT HAPPENED.

54
00:01:27,018 --> 00:01:28,186
WE READ THE PRESS REPORTS BUT

55
00:01:28,186 --> 00:01:29,287
IT'S ALL VERY TROUBLING.

56
00:01:29,287 --> 00:01:31,056
IT'S ALL VERY TROUBLING TO THOSE

57
00:01:31,056 --> 00:01:34,292
OF US THAT HOLD THE FBI IN SUCH

58
00:01:34,292 --> 00:01:36,494
HIGH REGARD THAT THERE ARE EVEN

59
00:01:36,494 --> 00:01:38,797
ALLEGATIONS THAT PEOPLE WERE

60
00:01:38,797 --> 00:01:41,399
ASSIGNED TO SURVEILLED OR EVEN

61
00:01:41,399 --> 00:01:43,168
SPY ON OUR CAMPAIGN.

62
00:01:43,168 --> 00:01:44,269
BUT LOOK, THE INSPECTOR GENERAL

63
00:01:44,269 --> 00:01:46,004
HAS THE RESOURCES TO GET TO THE

64
00:01:46,004 --> 00:01:46,705
BOTTOM OF IT.

65
00:01:46,705 --> 00:01:49,007
HE'S BEEN WORKING ON A MAJOR

66
00:01:49,007 --> 00:01:50,608
REPORT ABOUT THE FBI'S CONDUCT

67
00:01:50,608 --> 00:01:52,177
AND BY EXPANDING INTO THIS ROLE

68
00:01:52,177 --> 00:01:52,877
WE ARE VERY CONFIDENT THAT WE

69
00:01:52,877 --> 00:01:54,179
WILL GET TO THE BOTTOM OF IT, WE

70
00:01:54,179 --> 00:01:55,413
WILL FIND OUT WHAT HAPPENED AND

71
00:01:55,413 --> 00:01:56,681
THE AMERICAN PEOPLE AND ALL OF

72
00:01:56,681 --> 00:01:58,883
US WILL HAVE THE FACTS.

73
00:01:58,883 --> 00:02:00,185
>> Martha: OBVIOUSLY ON THE

74
00:02:00,185 --> 00:02:01,186
HILL THEY'VE BEEN VERY

75
00:02:01,186 --> 00:02:01,920
FRUSTRATED WITH THE INFORMATION

76
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:03,188
THAT THEY'VE BEEN GETTING FROM

77
00:02:03,188 --> 00:02:04,556
THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE.

78
00:02:04,556 --> 00:02:06,791
THE PRESIDENT HAS THE ABILITY TO

79
00:02:06,791 --> 00:02:08,258
DECLASSIFY THOSE REPORTS SO THAT

80
00:02:08,258 --> 00:02:09,794
THEY COME THROUGH UNREDACTED SO

81
00:02:09,794 --> 00:02:10,995
THAT THERE'S BETTER

82
00:02:10,995 --> 00:02:12,197
TRANSPARENCY.

83
00:02:12,197 --> 00:02:14,099
WILL HE DO THAT?

84
00:02:14,099 --> 00:02:14,733
>> PRESIDENT TRUMP REALLY

85
00:02:14,733 --> 00:02:17,168
BELIEVES THAT IT'S IMPORTANT

86
00:02:17,168 --> 00:02:18,269
THAT WE PROVIDE THE ACCOUNTABLE

87
00:02:18,269 --> 00:02:20,505
COMMITTEES ON CAPITOL HILL WITH

88
00:02:20,505 --> 00:02:21,906
ALL THE INFORMATION THAT IS

89
00:02:21,906 --> 00:02:25,810
NECESSARY TO DO THEIR WORK.

90
00:02:25,810 --> 00:02:27,345
AND I KNOW THAT THE DEPARTMENT

91
00:02:27,345 --> 00:02:28,980
OF JUSTICE HAS ASSIGNED

92
00:02:28,980 --> 00:02:29,914
ADDITIONAL PERSONNEL TO FOCUS ON

93
00:02:29,914 --> 00:02:33,284
THAT, TO WORK THROUGH THOSE

94
00:02:33,284 --> 00:02:36,254
DOCUMENTS AND THAT INFORMATION

95
00:02:36,254 --> 00:02:38,790
AND WE WILL CONTINUE TO LOOK

96
00:02:38,790 --> 00:02:40,425
FORWARD TO THEM PROVIDING

97
00:02:40,425 --> 00:02:40,992
INFORMATION.

98
00:02:40,992 --> 00:02:41,993
>> Martha: MATT GATES SAYING

99
00:02:41,993 --> 00:02:43,161
THE PRESIDENT MUST DECLASSIFY

100
00:02:43,161 --> 00:02:43,628
THOSE DOCUMENTS.

101
00:02:43,628 --> 00:02:45,196
HE HAS THE AUTHORITY TO DO SO.

102
00:02:45,196 --> 00:02:47,232
DO YOU BELIEVE HE WILL?

103
00:02:47,232 --> 00:02:48,767
>> IT WILL BE THE PRESIDENT'S

104
00:02:48,767 --> 00:02:49,768
DECISION TO DETERMINE WHAT ED

105
00:02:49,768 --> 00:02:52,771
CLASSIFIES AND WHAT HE DOESN'T,

106
00:02:52,771 --> 00:02:54,372
BUT THE PRINCIPLE HERE THAT THE

107
00:02:54,372 --> 00:02:55,106
AMERICAN PEOPLE HAVE A RIGHT TO

108
00:02:55,106 --> 00:03:00,145
KNOW WHAT HAPPENED, THE PEOPLE'S

109
00:03:00,145 --> 00:03:01,613
CONGRESS OUGHT TO HAVE THE

110
00:03:01,613 --> 00:03:02,213
ABILITY TO REVIEW THOSE

111
00:03:02,213 --> 00:03:05,283
MATERIALS IN A TIMELY WAY IS A

112
00:03:05,283 --> 00:03:07,185
PRINCIPLE WE ADHERE TO IN THIS

113
00:03:07,185 --> 00:03:07,585
WHITE HOUSE.

114
00:03:07,585 --> 00:03:08,920
>> Martha: ONE OF THE PUNDITS

115
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:10,421
ON THE SUNDAY SHOWS SAID THIS IS

116
00:03:10,421 --> 00:03:12,023
BECOMING A BLUE-RED FIGHT AND

117
00:03:12,023 --> 00:03:13,925
THAT THE PRESIDENT LIKES IT THAT

118
00:03:13,925 --> 00:03:14,392
WAY.

119
00:03:14,392 --> 00:03:15,794
DO YOU THINK THAT'S TRUE?

120
00:03:15,794 --> 00:03:16,094
>> NO.

121
00:03:16,094 --> 00:03:20,465
I THINK THE AMERICAN PEOPLE, THE

122
00:03:20,465 --> 00:03:22,667
AMERICAN PEOPLE UNDERSTAND THAT

123
00:03:22,667 --> 00:03:25,537
WHEN IT COMES TO THE DEPARTMENT

124
00:03:25,537 --> 00:03:28,439
OF JUSTICE, WHEN IT COMES TO THE

125
00:03:28,439 --> 00:03:29,140
FBI, THAT WE HAVE THOUSANDS OF

126
00:03:29,140 --> 00:03:32,844
MEN AND WOMEN WHO EACH AND EVERY

127
00:03:32,844 --> 00:03:36,181
DAY ARE DEDICATED TO ENFORCING

128
00:03:36,181 --> 00:03:37,682
THE LAWS AND PROTECTING OUR

129
00:03:37,682 --> 00:03:39,250
FAMILIES AND PROTECTING OUR

130
00:03:39,250 --> 00:03:39,584
COUNTRY.

131
00:03:39,584 --> 00:03:43,154
BUT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ALSO

132
00:03:43,154 --> 00:03:46,591
HAVE A SENSE THAT WE ALL DO THAT

133
00:03:46,591 --> 00:03:48,960
THINGS WENT AWRY IN 2016 AND WE

134
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:51,029
NEED TO KNOW WHAT HAPPENED.

135
00:03:51,029 --> 00:03:51,796
WE NEED TO GET TO THE BOTTOM OF

136
00:03:51,796 --> 00:03:53,965
THE FACTS.

137
00:03:53,965 --> 00:03:55,166
>> Martha: YOU GOT SOME HEAT

138
00:03:55,166 --> 00:03:57,335
WHEN YOU WENT ON SOME OF THE

139
00:03:57,335 --> 00:03:59,504
SUNDAY SHOWS FOR SAYING THAT

140
00:03:59,637 --> 00:04:03,341
THEY COMPARED YOUR COMMENTS TO

141
00:04:03,341 --> 00:04:04,075
RICHARD NIXON SAYING THAT ALL

142
00:04:04,075 --> 00:04:05,143
THE DOCUMENTS HAD BEEN GIVEN AND

143
00:04:05,143 --> 00:04:06,444
THAT HE NEEDS TO BE WRAPPED UP.

144
00:04:06,444 --> 00:04:10,148
WHAT DO YOU SAY TO THAT, AND

145
00:04:10,148 --> 00:04:10,915
ALSO NOW RUDY GIULIANI IS SAYING

146
00:04:10,915 --> 00:04:12,984
HE BELIEVES IT WILL BE WRAPPED

147
00:04:12,984 --> 00:04:14,619
UP ON SEPTEMBER 1ST?

148
00:04:14,619 --> 00:04:16,353
>> I WAS ASKED WHAT I THOUGHT OF

149
00:04:16,353 --> 00:04:16,988
THE INVESTIGATION.

150
00:04:16,988 --> 00:04:19,156
I SAID THAT WE HAVE FULLY

151
00:04:19,156 --> 00:04:20,558
COOPERATED IN THIS

152
00:04:20,558 --> 00:04:21,192
INVESTIGATION.

153
00:04:21,192 --> 00:04:22,160
AS I SAID, OVER A MILLION

154
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:24,596
DOCUMENTS HAVE BEEN PROVIDED AND

155
00:04:24,596 --> 00:04:27,198
I JUST SAID FOR THE SAKE OF THE

156
00:04:27,198 --> 00:04:27,932
COUNTRY, AND I THINK IT'S TIME

157
00:04:27,932 --> 00:04:31,970
THAT THE SPECIAL COUNSEL WRAP IT

158
00:04:31,970 --> 00:04:33,638
UP AND I THINK THAT'S PROBABLY

159
00:04:33,638 --> 00:04:36,241
AN OPINION WIDELY SHARED BY

160
00:04:36,241 --> 00:04:41,980
PEOPLE ALL ACROSS AMERICA, THE

161
00:04:41,980 --> 00:04:42,714
TRUTH IS IT'S BEEN NOW MORE THAN

162
00:04:42,714 --> 00:04:43,047
A YEAR.

163
00:04:43,047 --> 00:04:45,850
THE SPECIAL COUNSEL HAS A TEAM

164
00:04:45,850 --> 00:04:46,684
AROUND THEM THAT HAS BEEN

165
00:04:46,684 --> 00:04:48,586
LOOKING INTO ALL OF THE

166
00:04:48,586 --> 00:04:49,654
ALLEGATIONS HERE AND WITH THE

167
00:04:49,654 --> 00:04:50,755
FULL COOPERATION OF THE

168
00:04:50,755 --> 00:04:51,522
WHITE HOUSE THEY HAVE BEEN ABLE

169
00:04:51,522 --> 00:04:52,891
TO ASSEMBLE THE FACTS AND I

170
00:04:52,891 --> 00:04:56,861
CONTINUE TO HOPE AND TO SAY VERY

171
00:04:56,861 --> 00:04:59,998
RESPECTFULLY THAT THE SPECIAL

172
00:04:59,998 --> 00:05:01,866
COUNSEL OUGHT TO, WITH ALL

173
00:05:01,866 --> 00:05:03,334
DELIBERATE MEANS, COMPLETE THEIR

174
00:05:03,334 --> 00:05:06,838
WORK AND PROVIDE THE INFORMATION

175
00:05:06,838 --> 00:05:09,540
TO THEIR LEADERSHIP OF THE

176
00:05:09,540 --> 00:05:11,276
DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE THAT WILL

177
00:05:11,276 --> 00:05:12,277
COME FROM THIS INVESTIGATION SO

178
00:05:12,277 --> 00:05:14,312
THAT WE CAN JUST SIMPLY MOVE ON

179
00:05:14,312 --> 00:05:14,879
AS A COUNTRY.

180
00:05:14,879 --> 00:05:16,781
>> Martha: LET'S TURN TO SOME

181
00:05:16,781 --> 00:05:17,982
OF THAT PROGRESS.

182
00:05:17,982 --> 00:05:19,817
NORTH KOREA, A MEETING TOMORROW

183
00:05:19,817 --> 00:05:22,186
WITH THE LEADER OF SOUTH KOREA,

184
00:05:22,186 --> 00:05:23,588
PRESIDENT MOON, WILL HAPPEN.

185
00:05:23,588 --> 00:05:25,023
IS THIS MOMENT WITH NORTH KOREA

186
00:05:25,023 --> 00:05:27,492
ON JUNE 12TH GOING TO HAPPEN?

187
00:05:27,492 --> 00:05:31,162
>> AS THE PRESIDENT OFTEN SAYS,

188
00:05:31,162 --> 00:05:31,696
MARTHA, WE WILL SEE.

189
00:05:31,696 --> 00:05:33,398
WHAT I CAN TELL YOU IS THAT FROM

190
00:05:33,398 --> 00:05:35,400
THE EARLY DAYS OF THIS

191
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:36,868
ADMINISTRATION PRESIDENT TRUMP

192
00:05:36,868 --> 00:05:38,636
MADE IT CLEAR THAT THIS TIME, IN

193
00:05:38,636 --> 00:05:40,672
THIS ADMINISTRATION IT WOULD BE

194
00:05:40,672 --> 00:05:42,707
DIFFERENT FROM PRIOR

195
00:05:42,707 --> 00:05:43,474
ADMINISTRATIONS WERE NORTH KOREA

196
00:05:43,474 --> 00:05:46,978
FOUND A WAY TO GET CONCESSIONS

197
00:05:46,978 --> 00:05:47,712
FROM THE UNITED STATES AND FROM

198
00:05:47,712 --> 00:05:51,215
COUNTRIES IN THE WEST IN

199
00:05:51,215 --> 00:05:51,950
EXCHANGE FOR ILLUSORY PROMISES

200
00:05:51,950 --> 00:05:54,585
ABOUT ABANDONING THEIR NUCLEAR

201
00:05:54,585 --> 00:05:55,386
WEAPONS PROGRAM.

202
00:05:55,386 --> 00:05:56,120
PRESIDENT TRUMP FROM EARLY ON

203
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:59,691
INITIATED WHAT WE CALL THE

204
00:05:59,691 --> 00:06:00,325
EXTREME PRESSURE CAMPAIGN.

205
00:06:00,325 --> 00:06:01,993
HE MARSHALED THE RESOURCES OF

206
00:06:01,993 --> 00:06:03,428
THE WORLD COMMUNITY TO BRING

207
00:06:03,428 --> 00:06:06,230
ECONOMIC AND DIPLOMATIC PRESSURE

208
00:06:06,230 --> 00:06:08,599
WHILE KEEPING ALL OPTIONS ON THE

209
00:06:08,599 --> 00:06:10,168
TABLE TO ACHIEVE THE OBJECTIVE

210
00:06:10,168 --> 00:06:12,170
OF A NUCLEAR-FREE KOREAN

211
00:06:12,170 --> 00:06:12,603
PENINSULA.

212
00:06:12,603 --> 00:06:14,772
WE HAVE STAYED ON THAT PRESENT

213
00:06:14,772 --> 00:06:15,940
COURSE, WE HAVE NEVER WAVERED

214
00:06:15,940 --> 00:06:16,274
FROM IT.

215
00:06:16,274 --> 00:06:19,911
BUT WHEN KIM JONG UN THREW THE

216
00:06:19,911 --> 00:06:21,779
SOUTH KOREANS REACHED OUT AND

217
00:06:21,779 --> 00:06:23,648
SAID HE HE WOULD SUSPEND HIS

218
00:06:23,648 --> 00:06:25,149
NUCLEAR TESTING, SUSPEND HIS

219
00:06:25,149 --> 00:06:27,852
BALLISTIC TESTING AND BE WILLING

220
00:06:27,852 --> 00:06:29,654
TO ACHIEVE COMPLETE

221
00:06:29,654 --> 00:06:32,190
DENUCLEARIZATION THROUGH TALKS

222
00:06:32,190 --> 00:06:34,792
IN EXCHANGE FOR A MEETING WITH

223
00:06:34,792 --> 00:06:35,526
PRESIDENT TRUMP, THIS PRESIDENT

224
00:06:35,526 --> 00:06:36,060
READILY SAID YES.

225
00:06:36,060 --> 00:06:38,363
THEY ASKED FOR THE MEETING AND

226
00:06:38,363 --> 00:06:41,032
WE CONTINUE TO BE OPEN TO IT,

227
00:06:41,032 --> 00:06:43,134
BUT REST ASSURED THAT THE

228
00:06:43,134 --> 00:06:45,203
UNITED STATES WILL CONTINUE ON

229
00:06:45,203 --> 00:06:47,105
THE PATH THAT WE ARE ON BECAUSE

230
00:06:47,105 --> 00:06:49,073
THIS PRESIDENT HAS MADE IT CLEAR

231
00:06:49,073 --> 00:06:51,109
THAT WE WILL NOT TOLERATE

232
00:06:51,109 --> 00:06:53,978
NORTH KOREA POSSESSING NUCLEAR

233
00:06:53,978 --> 00:06:54,979
WEAPONS AND BALLISTIC MISSILES

234
00:06:54,979 --> 00:06:56,214
THAT THREATEN THE UNITED STATES

235
00:06:56,214 --> 00:06:57,215
AND OUR ALLIES.

236
00:06:57,215 --> 00:06:58,583
>> Martha: IS THAT PROCESS OF

237
00:06:58,583 --> 00:06:59,484
DENUCLEARIZATION SOMETHING THAT

238
00:06:59,484 --> 00:07:01,619
COULD HAPPEN OVER TIME IN STAGES

239
00:07:01,619 --> 00:07:02,420
COULD HAPPEN OVER TIME IN STAGE

240
00:07:02,420 --> 00:07:02,754
STAGES?

241
00:07:02,754 --> 00:07:03,488
>> WITH THE PRESIDENT HAS MADE

242
00:07:03,488 --> 00:07:06,758
CLEAR IS THAT WE NEED COMPLETE

243
00:07:06,758 --> 00:07:10,561
AND VERIFIABLE AND IRREVERSIBLE

244
00:07:10,561 --> 00:07:12,630
DENUCLEARIZATION AND THERE'S

245
00:07:12,630 --> 00:07:14,499
OPPORTUNITIES AND BENEFITS FOR

246
00:07:14,499 --> 00:07:16,234
NORTH KOREA ONCE WE REACH THAT

247
00:07:16,234 --> 00:07:18,803
POINT OF NO RETURN.

248
00:07:18,803 --> 00:07:20,671
ONCE WE REACH THE POINT WHERE AS

249
00:07:20,671 --> 00:07:22,707
THEY DISMANTLE THEIR NUCLEAR

250
00:07:22,707 --> 00:07:25,276
WEAPONS PROGRAM WITH PROPER

251
00:07:25,276 --> 00:07:27,645
VERIFICATION AND FULL

252
00:07:27,645 --> 00:07:30,982
TRANSPARENCY THAT THEN

253
00:07:30,982 --> 00:07:32,016
PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS ALREADY

254
00:07:32,016 --> 00:07:33,918
ORGANIZED SUPPORT FROM JAPAN,

255
00:07:33,918 --> 00:07:34,719
FROM SOUTH KOREA, FROM OTHER

256
00:07:34,719 --> 00:07:37,622
NATIONS IN THE REGION INCLUDING

257
00:07:37,622 --> 00:07:39,357
CHINA TO ORGANIZE THE RESOURCES

258
00:07:39,357 --> 00:07:40,291
THAT WOULD CREATE A BRIGHTER

259
00:07:40,291 --> 00:07:43,361
FUTURE FOR THE KIM REGIME, A

260
00:07:43,361 --> 00:07:44,095
BRIGHTER FUTURE MORE IMPORTANTLY

261
00:07:44,095 --> 00:07:45,663
FOR THE PEOPLE OF NORTH KOREA,

262
00:07:45,663 --> 00:07:48,900
BUT IT ALL BEGINS WITH

263
00:07:48,900 --> 00:07:51,636
NORTH KOREA COMMITTING TO

264
00:07:51,636 --> 00:07:52,270
COMPLETE DENUCLEARIZATION,

265
00:07:52,270 --> 00:07:55,506
TAKING CONCRETE STEPS TO ACHIEVE

266
00:07:55,506 --> 00:07:56,974
THAT.

267
00:07:56,974 --> 00:07:58,342

PRESIDENT, WAS IT YOUR FEELING,

270
00:08:01,546 --> 00:08:02,914
I THINK THE SUMMIT IS GOING TO

271
00:08:02,914 --> 00:08:06,584
HAPPEN IN JUNE?

272
00:08:06,584 --> 00:08:08,052
>> LIKE I SAID, I THINK THAT IN

273
00:08:08,052 --> 00:08:09,954
OUR DISCUSSIONS WITH LEADERS IN

274
00:08:09,954 --> 00:08:12,123

WE CONTINUE TO BE OPEN TO

00:08:21,032 --> 00:08:23,067
ACHIEVING DENUCLEARIZATION ON

282
00:08:23,067 --> 00:08:26,471
THE KOREAN PENINSULA BY

283
00:08:26,471 --> 00:08:27,105
PEACEABLE MEANS.

284
00:08:27,105 --> 00:08:27,905
>> Martha: THERE ARE SOME

285
00:08:27,905 --> 00:08:29,040
REPORTS THAT THE PRESIDENT IS

286
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:30,608
CONCERNED THAT IF IT FAILS OR IT

287
00:08:30,608 --> 00:08:32,643
DOESN'T GO WELL IT COULD BE VERY

288
00:08:32,643 --> 00:08:33,376
EMBARRASSING TO HAVE GONE THIS

289
00:08:33,376 --> 00:08:35,913
FAR DOWN THE ROAD AND THAT HE IS

290
00:08:35,913 --> 00:08:38,381
SEEKING INPUT AS TO WHETHER OR

291
00:08:38,381 --> 00:08:39,150
NOT HE SHOULD MAYBE RETHINK THIS

292
00:08:39,150 --> 00:08:40,451
WHOLE THING.

293
00:08:40,451 --> 00:08:44,422
>> I FELT        I DON'T THINK P

294
00:08:44,422 --> 00:08:44,455
>> I FELT        I DON'T THINK E

295
00:08:44,455 --> 00:08:44,489
>> I FELT        I DON'T THINK I

>> I FELT        I DON'T THINK U

299
00:08:44,622 --> 00:08:45,189
>> I FELT        I DON'T THINK P

300
00:08:45,189 --> 00:08:46,324
IS THINKING ABOUT PUBLIC

301
00:08:46,324 --> 00:08:48,459
RELATIONS.

302
00:08:48,593 --> 00:08:49,260
HE'S THINKING ABOUT HOW WE

303
00:08:49,260 --> 00:08:52,830
ACHIEVE WHAT HAS ELUDED

304
00:08:52,830 --> 00:08:54,398
SUCCESSIVE AMERICAN

305
00:08:54,398 --> 00:08:54,999
ADMINISTRATIONS.

306
00:08:54,999 --> 00:08:55,633
TRUTHFULLY, THE CLINTON

307
00:08:55,633 --> 00:08:57,668
ADMINISTRATION, EVEN THE BUSH

308
00:08:57,668 --> 00:09:00,338
ADMINISTRATION GOT PLAYED IN THE

309
00:09:00,338 --> 00:09:01,205
PAST.

310
00:09:01,205 --> 00:09:03,307
WE OFFERED CONCESSIONS TO THE

311
00:09:03,307 --> 00:09:04,942
NORTH KOREAN REGIME IN EXCHANGE

312
00:09:04,942 --> 00:09:05,576
FOR PROMISES TO END THEIR

313
00:09:05,576 --> 00:09:08,379
NUCLEAR WEAPONS PROGRAMS ONLY TO

314
00:09:08,379 --> 00:09:09,113
SEE THEM BREAK THOSE PROMISES

315
00:09:09,113 --> 00:09:10,781
AND ABANDON THEM.

316
00:09:10,781 --> 00:09:12,216
IT WOULD BE A GREAT MISTAKE FOR

317
00:09:12,216 --> 00:09:14,352
KIM JONG UN TO THINK HE COULD

318
00:09:14,352 --> 00:09:16,420
PLAY DONALD TRUMP.

319
00:09:16,420 --> 00:09:17,054
>> Martha: CLEARLY THE

320
00:09:17,054 --> 00:09:17,755
PRESIDENT IS STILL WILLING TO

321
00:09:17,755 --> 00:09:19,090
WALK AWAY.

322
00:09:19,090 --> 00:09:23,995
>> THERE'S NO QUESTION, BUT WE

323
00:09:23,995 --> 00:09:26,097
HOPE FOR BETTER.

324
00:09:26,097 --> 00:09:30,601
WE REALLY HOPE THAT KIM JONG UN

325
00:09:30,601 --> 00:09:32,236
WILL SEIZE THE OPPORTUNITY TO

326
00:09:32,236 --> 00:09:36,174
DISMANTLE HIS NUCLEAR WEAPONS

327
00:09:36,174 --> 00:09:38,643
PROGRAM AND DO SO BY PEACEABLE

328
00:09:38,643 --> 00:09:39,577
MEANS.

329
00:09:39,577 --> 00:09:40,745
THERE WAS SOME TALK ABOUT THE

330
00:09:40,745 --> 00:09:43,514
LIBYA MODEL LAST WEEK AND AS THE

331
00:09:43,514 --> 00:09:49,787
PRESIDENT MADE CLEAR, THIS WILL

332
00:09:49,787 --> 00:09:51,055
ONLY END LIKE THE LIBYA MODEL

333
00:09:51,055 --> 00:09:53,357
ENDED IF KIM JONG UN DOESN'T

334
00:09:53,357 --> 00:09:53,758
MAKE A DEAL.

335
00:09:53,758 --> 00:09:54,792
>> Martha: SOME PEOPLE SAW

336
00:09:54,792 --> 00:09:56,861
THAT AS A THREAT.

337
00:09:56,861 --> 00:09:58,996
>> I THINK IT'S MORE OF A FACT.

338
00:09:58,996 --> 00:10:02,733
PRESIDENT TRUMP MADE IT CLEAR

339
00:10:02,733 --> 00:10:03,401
THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA

340
00:10:03,401 --> 00:10:04,101
UNDER HIS LEADERSHIP IS NOT

341
00:10:04,101 --> 00:10:08,206
GOING TO TOLERATE THE REGIME IN

342
00:10:08,206 --> 00:10:09,607
NORTH KOREA POSSESSING NUCLEAR

343
00:10:09,607 --> 00:10:10,341
WEAPONS AND BALLISTIC MISSILES

344
00:10:10,341 --> 00:10:13,177
THAT THREATEN THE UNITED STATES

345
00:10:13,177 --> 00:10:14,045
AND OUR ALLIES.

346
00:10:14,045 --> 00:10:16,547
WE'VE MADE IT CLEAR THAT WE ARE

347
00:10:16,547 --> 00:10:18,616
CONTINUING TO BRING ECONOMIC AND

348
00:10:18,616 --> 00:10:20,518
DIPLOMATIC PRESSURE TO BEAR ON

349
00:10:20,518 --> 00:10:21,852
NORTH KOREA THAT ALL OPTIONS ARE

350
00:10:21,852 --> 00:10:23,020
ON THE TABLE TO ACHIEVE THAT

351
00:10:23,020 --> 00:10:26,257
END, BUT THAT BEING SAID, WE'VE

352
00:10:26,257 --> 00:10:28,426
SEEN GREAT PROGRESS IN RECENT

353
00:10:28,426 --> 00:10:29,227
MONTHS.

354
00:10:29,227 --> 00:10:30,761
LAST MONTH'S INTER-KOREAN SUMMIT

355
00:10:30,761 --> 00:10:32,196
WHERE YOU SAW THE LEADERS OF

356
00:10:32,196 --> 00:10:33,331
NORTH AND SOUTH MEET AT THE BLUE

357
00:10:33,331 --> 00:10:36,834
HOUSE, HAVE THAT DISCUSSION.

358
00:10:36,834 --> 00:10:39,003
THE REALITY IS THAT WE HOPE FOR

359
00:10:39,003 --> 00:10:39,670
A PEACEABLE SOLUTION.

360
00:10:39,670 --> 00:10:42,473
THE PRESIDENT REMAINS OPEN TO A

361
00:10:42,473 --> 00:10:44,875
SUMMIT TAKING PLACE AND WILL

362
00:10:44,875 --> 00:10:48,379
CONTINUE TO PURSUE THAT PATH

363
00:10:48,379 --> 00:10:49,714
EVEN WHILE WE STAND STRONG ON

364
00:10:49,714 --> 00:10:51,582
THE OBJECTIVE OF

365
00:10:51,582 --> 00:10:52,850
DENUCLEARIZATION IN THE EXTREME

366
00:10:52,850 --> 00:10:53,985
PRESSURE CAMPAIGN THAT IS

367
00:10:53,985 --> 00:10:54,452
UNDERWAY TODAY.

368
00:10:54,452 --> 00:10:55,453
>> Martha: IF IT DOESN'T

369
00:10:55,453 --> 00:10:56,654
HAPPEN, THE MILITARY OPTION IS

370
00:10:56,654 --> 00:11:00,424
BASICALLY BACK ON THE TABLE.

371
00:11:00,424 --> 00:11:02,627
>> WELL, IT NEVER CAME OFF,

372
00:11:02,627 --> 00:11:03,594
MARTHA.

373
00:11:03,594 --> 00:11:04,095
THE TRUTH IS THAT

374
00:11:04,095 --> 00:11:06,297
PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS MADE IT

375
00:11:06,297 --> 00:11:07,031
CLEAR THAT THIS ADMINISTRATION

376
00:11:07,031 --> 00:11:10,501
WILL NOT TOLERATE THE REGIME IN

377
00:11:10,501 --> 00:11:12,403
