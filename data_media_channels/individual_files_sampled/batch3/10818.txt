NATO's come up with its own way of teaching it to youngsters the Alliance has released a Facebook game called the news hero players as opposed to learn how to separate truthful stories from the fake ones and as I said sure can Detroit welcome to NATO's new online weapon against misinformation it's the news hero I promised myself to report only the truth join me on my quest to filter the news some of the headlines about the game might imply that its developers have a bone to pick with Russia but on closer inspection it seems it doesn't have that much Russian fake news to decipher you might have thought that NATO's Latvia based strategic communications center of excellence could dig up something better especially given the lengths that went to last year trying to prove that Russian TV comedy was really an undercover propaganda machine and of course there's NATO's deep-seated suspicion of all things Russian we don't accept cyber propaganda we will not counter Russian propaganda with more propaganda we have to be able to counter this information with facts but NATO's new virtual reality world passions seem slightly more subdued you enter a rather suspiciously empty and slow-paced newsroom where you are the news editor in charge of deciding which reports are real and which are not by clicking on a folder with news stories in it accompanied by repetitive elevator music it's not yet clear how successful the game is in fighting fake news since it's yet to collect enough likes to be considered a viral success and so far it's had mixed reviews getting an egg for effort from some users but dismissed as a propaganda tool by others all you need to enjoy the game is a Facebook account and sign off your Facebook info to the Alliance in the process Anastasio check it out RT London you
