in what appears to be four or four what appears to be the first time ever this country is now systematically taking children from their parents at the border thanks to new directives issued by the Trump administration immigrants arriving to the border often seeking asylum so not trying to sneak in they're there to tell Border Patrol they're there are having their children ripped away from them immigrants and civil rights groups are saying they have never seen anything like this kids as young as nine years old or seven years old cases of children as young as 18 months okay ripped out of the arms of their mother and putting those children into government-run shelters for a very specific reason to punish the immigrants to serve as what White House chief of staff Jean Kelly called quote a tough deterrent in an NPR interview this month and when confronted with the idea that separating families and mothers from children is cruel he added quote the children will be taken care of put into foster care or whatever that's a verbatim quote or whatever and if Kelly's words or whatever about the fate of an 18 month old don't exactly fill you with confidence the federal government has the wherewithal the capacity or the intention to take care of these children their track record makes it clear that your doubts are warranted because last month the New York Times reported that HHS lost track of nearly 1500 migrant children placed with sponsors of more than 7,000 unaccompanied minors those are minors who come without parents who cross the border that's 1,500 children lost by the government here to help me understand what this administration is doing to these children and their families Leake learnt the deputy director the National immigrant Rights Project ACLU who was recently in El Paso and Laura st. John a legal director at the Florence project a non-profit in Arizona provides free legal services to people in immigration custody let me start with you Laura I just want to start a sort of factual basis which is the government's doing something they haven't been doing before which is to separate children from parents right that's correct Chris I mean what's happening right now is really unprecedented what we've seen here in Arizona is actually since January over 200 cases of parents being separated from their children and some of these children are extremely young as you mentioned we've actually seen children who are two years old regularly and just last week we saw a 53 week old infant in court without a parent I'm sorry I'm having a really hard time thinking about this so 53 week old infant comes with presumably his or her mother and they're apprehended by customs Border Patrol and then they're processed in some way and at some point someone from the government in a uniform comes and physically takes a 53 week old baby away from the mother that's correct yeah what happens oftentimes at the border is that the the parents are separated and taken into separate custody and the children are brought into the custody of the office of refugee resettlement and brought into shelters that are run by the government there are shelters and then like it's hard to run a child care system like who's watching the 53 week old infant so again it's the Office of refugee resettlement is tasked with housing children who are unaccompanied minors and in the past that's always referred to children who cross the border sort of on their own and and wasn't really involving young children like what we're seeing now but what we're seeing now is that because the government is separating the children from the parents the government is actually you know rendering these children as unaccompanied minors and making them unaccompanied and bringing them into these shelters so you've a so that makes them now I understand so you've got a situation where there are unaccompanied minors across the border by themselves or are and they tend to be 1415 like it you know and that's unfortunate that they're here by themselves and they need somewhere to go that's one situation but why create that situation is that what's happening okay so we're creating but I just want to be clear we didn't do that before policy used to be you show up with an 18 month old in your arms you're not gonna be given you're not gonna be told hey you can come to the u.s. you will be processed with that shot this is unprecedented this is the worst thing I've seen in 25 plus years of doing the civil rights work I mean I am talking to these mothers and they're describing their kids screaming mommy mommy don't let them take me away five years old years old and they're just being ripped away I really see them I really they don't see them they get to speak to them once in a while but of course if you're talking about an 18-month old two years old they can't even speak on the phone I really feel like these policy debates are becoming so abstract if the policy makers could sit in those ice offices down there at the border for a day and watch these little kids begging not to be taken away they're already traumatized from having to flee their countries and then they're taken away the medical evidence is overwhelming that we may be doing permanent trauma to these kids and yet the government's finding every way they can to try and justify it and let me make two points about the statements that the secretary has been putting out secretary nielsen she's saying you don't want your child taken away go to a port of entry and present yourself and so you want to cylon people who were presenting themselves including the Congolese mom who's the leaf plenaries presented themselves at a border still had their child taken away I want to talk about the story for a second woman fleeing the Congo she becomes the United States not sneaking in she's showing up at a port of entry to say I am here seeking asylum in America the beacon of Liberty with my child I throw myself on your mercy and the US government does what they put her in a makeshift hotel with the daughter for four days and then they say to them we want the daughter to come in another room for a second the daughter goes in the other room the mother then hears the child screaming please please don't take me away from my mommy the mother wasn't told for four days where the child was going she went to Chicago the mothers in San Diego Chicago was might as well be the moon for us someone from a little village in the Congo gets to speak to the daughter once every few weeks for a few minutes when we file the lawsuit then the government says well by the time she made it to the Congo she no longer had her papers well of course not and they said maybe she wasn't really the mother the judge says well why didn't you do a DNA test they do the DNA test which takes two seconds and where she's the mother where's the mother I want to read I want to read to you Laura from from one of the declarations from a Honduran mother named Miriam who is separated from 18 month old son just about that at that moment that happens the immigration officers made me walk out my son to a government vehicle and place my son in a car seat in the vehicle my son was crying as I put him in the seat I did have a chance to try to comfort my son because the officers slammed the door shut as soon as he was in the seat I was crying too I cry even now and I think about that moment when the border officer took my son away is that a is that a common is that happening a lot you know I think what what our clients report in terms of the devastation that they feel having been separated from their children I hear stories of that nature pretty regularly unfortunately and the type of devastation that we're talking about you know what what Lee mentioned we're a family separated mother doesn't know where her child is for four days that's entirely common right now in this administration is that children and parents who are separated sometimes don't have any way to communicate with each other for four days for weeks I've seen months where a parent had no idea where their child was after the US government took the child away um you're suing we are can they do this we don't believe they can we are waiting for the decision we think it will come any day we are hoping the judge says this can't happen any longer and I want to make one other point even the women who can fathers across the border they're being prosecuted we don't think asylum seekers every prosecutor but we've said to the government what we said in court is you want to prosecute them for this misdemeanor and they get a few days in jail they take the kid away for those few days give the child back after we have a client the named plaintiff in our case one of the named plaintiffs Lee did time serve for a few days for the prosecution it's been seven months they haven't returned her child where's the kid he's in a facility in Chicago and they told her in Chicago and she is in Texas and they told her your son is in Chicago and she said to us I don't know whether Chicago is a man a place a facility that's all they said to her your son is in Chicago your your your what is a lawsuit contend about why they do not have the power to do this I mean it's morally odious it's Rob viously despicable right sorry I'll meditite why is it not promising so we say the Due Process Clause prevents a family from being separated parent shot unless there's a compelling reason what that's traditionally meant is the parent is a danger to the child of course you separate if the parent is beating the child or neglectful or unfit but you don't just separate for no reason and we've and so now the government won't in court admit that they're doing it to punish and deter even though they that's what they were saying publicly so they're trying to come up with these railey they're not being clear about that no and so they're coming to these retroactive justifications like well so they're saying they're doing it for a reason not as a blanket policy but stop people from coming when the judge pressed and said well what's the reason they said well maybe it's not really the parent and the judge said well what about DNA and you know it just went like that one after another they are not admit they or say won't admit what the policy is they won't admit the rationale for the policy but when you go through their rationales and none of them makes sense it's clear why they're doing it they're doing it to deter asylums and just to be clear Laura like I just want to be clear on this because I know that there's a lot of things about the the way that immigration policy works in this country that have been broken and terrible for a long time and sometimes people find them in the Trump administration it turns out that there's there's been stuff like this happening for a long time but this is not that right right I mean you've been doing this work this is new yeah absolutely again this is this is unprecedented the the number of people that we are seeing being separated is like nothing I've seen and I've been here for nearly a decade in Arizona doing immigration work does it take a toll on the I keep thinking about having that job of taking a screaming child away does it take a toll on the people who are doing this you know I can't speak for for anybody who works for Border Patrol but I will say that I think what is happening is absolutely inhumane I think you mentioned that a lot of things about immigration law are complicated and can can be confusing and I would say this is not that situation you know taking parents and children and separating them for no good reason there is no reason to do that there it's just unjustifiable frankly and inhumane if you're watching this and you feel like that it is unjust falling and you mean I would really urge you to contact people that represent you in the United States government to tell them that you feel that way legal learn and Laura st.
