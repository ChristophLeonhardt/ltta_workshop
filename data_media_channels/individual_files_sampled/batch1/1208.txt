just a week after eleven black rhinos were moved to a new reserve in Kenya three-quarters of them have died early investigations indicate they were poisoned by the high level of salt in the water in their new home we've been doing this for decades moving rhinos in order to manage the populations because they are all isolated you want to prevent any inbreeding but this was a new sanctuary in Tsavo East's we used to have rhinos there they were all poached out and now we're bringing them back to that area so it's a very exciting possibility for Kenya but it's ended in tragedy this is actually a national disaster Kenya's tourism and Wildlife Minister has ordered the Wildlife Service to suspend the relocation of black rhinos while investigations continue moving rhinos can be a risky process it involves putting endangered animals to sleep for the journey and then reviving them but the loss of so many in one go is unprecedented in the past 12 years about 150 rhinos have been moved in this way but these deaths have doubled the mortality figure the uk-based charity save the rhinos estimates there are fewer than 5,500 black rhinos in the world all of them in Africa poaching is forcing wildlife parks to take such drastic measures nine rhinos were killed in Kenya last year and three more shot dead in May and their horns removed Kenya is leading the push for a total ban on ivory trading worldwide in April president Uhuru Kenyatta ordered the world's largest stock of ivory and rhino horn to be destroyed while rhino ivory fetches a high price preventing poaching remains a challenge Laura burden manly al Jazeera
