one of the very striking moments in the book is when you talk about how your top managers after you rebuild bridge water into a success again basically came to you and said look here's what Ray does well he's a genius money manager and thinker and so forth but here's what Ray doesn't do well and I have to read this because for anybody leading other people just a very startling quote says quote ray sometimes says or does things to employees that make them feel incompetent unnecessary humiliated overwhelmed belittled oppressed or otherwise bad and you say very candidly your first reaction was again like I don't want to do that these people I work with I don't want to have those consequences and on the other hand it's this radical straightforwardness and I want them to speak to me in a straightforward way so we were at a moment that's a that's a painful moment and then it's a moment of reflection should I not be as straightforward should they not be what could I do differently so what we decided to do was deal with it together like I thought that I should then ask the questions do you not want me to tell you what I think do you I would appreciate you doing the same with me in that straightforward so how should we be with each other and by agreeing how we should be with each other and writing those things down so that with this is what we're doing we began to get more of the management principles of how we are with each other because it's the key to their success but but it can be painful it can be under not understood well there are things in our brain neuroscientists tell me that there's a part of our brain which we call the prefrontal cortex the thoughtful part of our brain in which we sort of want to be sporadic ly straightforward we'd like to know what our weaknesses is because it's logical and then there's an emotional part of the brain we understand the amygdala that is the fight-or-flight and it takes disagreement and it converts that into a battle and it's not easy and so those two parts of our brains are at odds and if we understand that we work ourselves through at the end of the day can I be radically truthful with you like what's so bad about us being radically truthful with each other and radically transparent
