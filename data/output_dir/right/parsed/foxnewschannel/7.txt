>> Martha: WE ARE BACK LIVE ON
THE BORDER IN YUMA, ARIZONA.
MORE ON THE REALITY OF THIS, THE
AGING FENCE, THAT MANY SAY
DESPERATELY NEEDS TO BE
TRANSFORMED INTO A FULL-FLEDGED
BORDER WALL.
SO YOU ARE ABOUT TO VISIT THE
WALL, THIS IS THE WALL THAT THE
PRESIDENT HAS BEEN PROMISING.
AT THE 2-MILE STRETCH BUT IT
WILL GIVE EVERYONE A SENSE OF
WHAT IT WILL LOOK LIKE.
>> THAT'S RIGHT.
THIS IS ONE OF THOSE AREAS THAT
IT'S IMPORTANT TO HAVE A WALL.
IT'S NOT WILLY-NILLY.
WE SPENT A LOT OF TIME
DETERMINING WHERE THE SMUGGLING
ROUTES ARE, AND THAT'S WHERE WE
ARE BUILDING THE WALL.
>> Martha: THE PRESIDENT
TALKED ABOUT DRUGS COMING ACROSS
THE BORDER.
IT SAID TO BE WORSE THAN CRACK
COCAINE, AND, HOW DOES IT GET I
IN.
HOW ARE THESE KILO BRICKS OF
FENTANYL FINDING THEIR WAY
ACROSS THE BORDER?
>> >> WE HAVE ABOUT 7,000 PEOPLE
ACROSS ITS BORDER, AND WE HAVE
PEOPLE TO INSPECT AND ENSURE
THEY ARE NOT BRINGING CONTRABAND
WITH THEM.
AND, TO MAKE A SEIZURE, THE
INVESTIGATOR CAN TAKE ACTION
AGAINST THAT.
>> AND HOW THEY BRING THINGS
ACROSS THE BORDER, AND WE KNOW
WHERE THIS IS HAPPENING.
NOT ONLY LOOKING AT HOW WE GET
THESE PATHWAYS, BUT HOW IT'S
FUNDED AND HOW THEY SEND THEIR
PROCEEDS BACK.
ALL OF THAT IS PART OF THE ISIS
MISSION.
AND WE HAD AT MINISTERIAL THAT
WE CALLED FOR IN JULY IN
GUATEMALA, TO GET ALL OF THE
COUNTRIES TO WORK ON A REGIONAL
APPROACH.
THIS TCO THREAT IS REAL, AND
PART OF OUR PROMISE FOR SECURIT
SECURITY.
>> SO ON THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL
SAYING THEY WANTED TO BANISH
EYES, SAYING YOU GUYS WERE
BRUTAL, WHAT DO YOU SAY ABOUT
THAT?
>> I SAY THEY DON'T UNDERSTAND
THERE ARE 20,000 PUBLIC SERVANTS
OUT THERE GETTING UP EACH AND
EVERY DAY TO PROTECT THIS
COUNTRY AND THAT'S WHAT WE DO AT
I.C.E.
WE INVESTIGATE TRANSNATIONAL
CRIMINAL ORGANIZATIONS, TAKE
DOWN THE DARK WEB ORGANIZATIONS,
AND WE WORK WITH CDP TO TAKE THE
DETAINEES THAT THEY HAVE AND
TAKE THEM THROUGH THE DUE
PROCESS TO BE REMOVED.
THAT'S WHAT THE FOLKS AT I.C.E.
DO AND IT'S A NECESSARY ELEMENT
OF HOW THE DEPARTMENT ADDS TO
THE OVERALL SAFETY AND SECURITY
OF THE COUNTRY.
>> CYBER CRIMES, THAT'S WHAT
THEY FIGHT.
PROTECTING OUR COMMUNITIES.
HELPING STATE ORGANIZATIONS WITH
INVESTIGATIONS, THAT'S WHAT
I.C.E. DOES.
IT'S IRRESPONSIBLE AND DANGEROUS
FOR ANYONE TO THINK DIFFERENTLY.
>> ONE THING I WANTED TO ASK
ABOUT WAS THE QUESTION THAT CAME
UP ON FOX THIS MORNING ABOUT HOW
UNITED EVERYONE IS IN THE
OPERATIONS THAT YOU GUYS ARE
DOING, AND THAT THE
ADMINISTRATION AT THE
WHITE HOUSE.
THE SUGGESTION ONCE RAISED BY
BRANDON JUDD AT THE UNION, HE
SPEAKS FOR THE UNION OF THE
BORDER PATROL AND HE SUGGESTED
THAT BACK IN 2016 WHEN A LOT OF
THEM WERE ENDORSING
PRESIDENT TRUMP FOR OFFICE, YOU
ASKED THEM TO WITHDRAW THAT
ENDORSEMENT.
WHAT DO YOU SAY TO THAT,
COMMISSIONER?
>> IT'S NOT TRUE.
WE WORK CLOSELY WITH OUR UNIONS
TO ADVANCE THE BORDER PATROLS TO
PROTECTING OUR BORDER.
WHAT WE ARE DOING HERE ON THE
BORDER IS ADVANCING FOR SECURITY
PRIORITIES FOR THE
ADMINISTRATION, AND WE ARE
BUILDING THE WALL.
WE ARE ADDING AGENTS AND PUTTING
TECHNOLOGY IN PLACE.
>> SO YOU NEVER ASKED ANYONE TO
CHANGE YOUR ENDORSEMENT OF
PRESIDENT TRUMP?
>> THAT'S A BAD IDEA.
>> I WOULD BE SURPRISED TO HEAR
ANYONE SUGGEST THAT HE IS NOT
FULLY AND ON THE AGENDA.
