1
00:00:01,301 --> 00:00:04,270
TO SUPPORT THEM IN WHATEVER 

2
00:00:04,270 --> 00:00:04,971
THEY NEED. 

3
00:00:04,971 --> 00:00:06,372
THE PRESIDENT HAS A PHONE CALL 

4
00:00:06,372 --> 00:00:10,042
WITH THE PRIME MINISTER OF 

5
00:00:10,042 --> 00:00:10,276
JAPAN. 

6
00:00:10,276 --> 00:00:11,277
AND THEY CONTINUED TO 

7
00:00:11,277 --> 00:00:14,214
MAINTAINING SANCTIONS ON NORTH 

8
00:00:14,214 --> 00:00:14,447
KOREA. 

9
00:00:14,447 --> 00:00:16,382
AND THEY LOOK FORWARD TO SEEING 

10
00:00:16,382 --> 00:00:18,985
EACH OTHER AND TO CONTINUE 

11
00:00:18,985 --> 00:00:20,219
THESE IMPORTANT CONVERSATIONS 

12
00:00:20,219 --> 00:00:21,053
WITH ALLIES. 

13
00:00:21,053 --> 00:00:22,388
LASTLY, ON BEHALF OF OUR ENTIRE 

14
00:00:22,388 --> 00:00:25,492
ADMINISTRATION I WANT TO EXTEND 

15
00:00:25,492 --> 00:00:27,493
PRAYERS TO THE FAMILY, FRIENDS, 

16
00:00:27,493 --> 00:00:29,829
AND LOVED ONES OF MOLLIE 

17
00:00:29,829 --> 00:00:30,296
TIBBETTS. 

18
00:00:30,296 --> 00:00:32,198
THE NATION HAS WATCHED FOR 30 

19
00:00:32,198 --> 00:00:34,100
DAYS AS OFFICIALS HAVE SEARCHED 

20
00:00:34,100 --> 00:00:36,168
FOR MOLLIE, A RISING SOPHOMORE 

21
00:00:36,168 --> 00:00:37,636
AT THE UNIVERSITY OF IOWA. 

22
00:00:37,636 --> 00:00:38,604
SADLY, THE INDIVIDUAL BELIEVED 

23
00:00:38,604 --> 00:00:40,874
TO BE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE 

24
00:00:40,874 --> 00:00:42,976
MURDER IS AN ILLEGAL IMMIGRANT, 

25
00:00:42,976 --> 00:00:45,211
MAKING THIS AN UNFORTUNATE 

26
00:00:45,211 --> 00:00:48,314
REMINDER OF WHY WE NEED TO 

27
00:00:48,314 --> 00:00:49,615
STRENGTHEN OUR IMMIGRATION 

28
00:00:49,615 --> 00:00:49,815
LAWS. 

29
00:00:49,815 --> 00:00:53,219
THE BIBLE TELLS US THE LORD 

30
00:00:53,219 --> 00:00:56,588
HEALS THE BROKEN HEARTED. 

31
00:00:56,588 --> 00:01:01,227
THE TIBETS FAMILY -- WE ARE 

32
00:01:01,227 --> 00:01:06,432
GRIEVINGS WITH THEM. 

33
00:01:06,432 --> 00:01:15,708
>> MIKE ELKO MEN PLEADED GUILTY 

34
00:01:15,708 --> 00:01:17,710
TO PAYING STORMY DANIELS AND 

35
00:01:17,710 --> 00:01:18,277
KAREN McDOUGAL. 

36
00:01:18,277 --> 00:01:20,313
>> WE'VE STATED HE DID NOTHING 

37
00:01:20,313 --> 00:01:20,546
WRONG. 

38
00:01:20,546 --> 00:01:22,282
AND THERE ARE NO CHARGES AND 

39
00:01:22,282 --> 00:01:23,816
WE'VE COMMENTED ON THIS 

40
00:01:23,816 --> 00:01:24,384
EXTENSIVELY. 

41
00:01:24,384 --> 00:01:25,652
>> WHY NOT REPORT THESE 

42
00:01:25,652 --> 00:01:26,019
PAYMENTS. 

43
00:01:26,019 --> 00:01:27,020
>> AGAIN, I'M NOT GOING TO GET 

44
00:01:27,020 --> 00:01:30,523
INTO THE BACK AND FORTH 

45
00:01:30,523 --> 00:01:31,224
DETAILS. 

46
00:01:31,224 --> 00:01:33,026
I CAN TELL YOU AS THE PRESIDENT 

47
00:01:33,026 --> 00:01:37,130
HAS STATED, THERE ARE NO 

48
00:01:37,130 --> 00:01:37,930
CHARGES AGAINST HIM. 

49
00:01:37,930 --> 00:01:39,832
AND JUST BECAUSE MICHAEL COHEN 

50
00:01:39,832 --> 00:01:41,434
MADE A PLEA DEAL DOESN'T MEAN 

51
00:01:41,434 --> 00:01:42,735
THAT IMPLICATES THE PRESIDENT. 

52
00:01:42,735 --> 00:01:44,804
>> ARE YOU SAYING THAT THE 

53
00:01:44,804 --> 00:01:47,006
PRESIDENT HAS NEVER LIED TO THE 

54
00:01:47,006 --> 00:01:47,439
AMERICAN PEOPLE. 

55
00:01:47,439 --> 00:01:50,410
>> SO MANY PEOPLE LOOK AT THE 

56
00:01:50,410 --> 00:01:53,546
TAPE OF HIM ON AIR FORCE ONE. 

57
00:01:53,546 --> 00:01:55,582
HE SAID HE KNEW NOTHING ABOUT 

58
00:01:55,582 --> 00:01:56,115
THE PAYMENTS. 

59
00:01:56,115 --> 00:01:58,551
>> I THINK THAT'S A RIDICULOUS 

60
00:01:58,551 --> 00:01:58,851
ACCUSATION. 

61
00:01:58,851 --> 00:02:00,153
THE PRESIDENT HAS DONE NOTHING 

62
00:02:00,153 --> 00:02:02,355
WRONG AND THERE ARE NO CHARGES 

63
00:02:02,355 --> 00:02:02,822
AGAINST HIM. 

64
00:02:02,822 --> 00:02:04,089
>> THE PRESIDENT SAID TO FOX 

65
00:02:04,089 --> 00:02:09,862
NEWS THIS MORNING THAT THIS 

66
00:02:09,862 --> 00:02:11,364
COULD NOT HAVE BEEN AN ILLEGAL 

67
00:02:11,364 --> 00:02:12,732
CAMPAIGN CONTRIBUTION BECAUSE 

68
00:02:12,732 --> 00:02:13,399
HE GAVE THE MONEY. 

69
00:02:13,399 --> 00:02:16,135
HE PUT $60 MILLION OF HIS OWN 

70
00:02:16,135 --> 00:02:17,369
MONEY INTO THE CAMPAIGN. 

71
00:02:17,369 --> 00:02:19,706
HOW DO YOU DRAW THE LINE -- 

72
00:02:19,706 --> 00:02:22,041
MAYBE IT DIDN'T FLOW THROUGH 

73
00:02:22,041 --> 00:02:23,409
THE CAMPAIGN. 

74
00:02:23,409 --> 00:02:25,144
HOW DO YOU DRAW THE LINE 

75
00:02:25,144 --> 00:02:27,347
BETWEEN A CAMPAIGN CONVICTION. 

76
00:02:27,347 --> 00:02:28,348
>> I'M NOT GOING TO GET INTO 

77
00:02:28,348 --> 00:02:31,251
THE BACK AND FORTHS OF THE 

78
00:02:31,251 --> 00:02:32,185
LEGAL PART OF THAT. 

79
00:02:32,185 --> 00:02:33,886
I WOULD REFER YOU TO THE 

80
00:02:33,886 --> 00:02:34,319
OUTSIDE COUNSEL. 

81
00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:37,056
WHAT I CAN TELL YOU IS WHAT THE 

82
00:02:37,056 --> 00:02:38,290
PRESIDENT HAS STATED A NUMBER 

83
00:02:38,290 --> 00:02:40,460
OF TIMES, HE DID NOTHING WRONG 

84
00:02:40,460 --> 00:02:43,763
AND THERE ARE NO CHARGES 

85
00:02:43,763 --> 00:02:44,664
AGAINST HIM. 

86
00:02:44,664 --> 00:02:50,270
JUST BECAUSE MICHAEL COHEN HAS 

87
00:02:50,270 --> 00:02:52,538
MADE A DEAL DOESN'T MEAN 

88
00:02:52,538 --> 00:02:52,939
ANYTHING. 

89
00:02:52,939 --> 00:02:54,440
>> THE IMPLICATION IS THAT 

90
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:56,142
MICHAEL COHEN GAVE UP SOMETHING 

91
00:02:56,142 --> 00:02:57,543
THAT THE PRESIDENT WOULD RATHER 

92
00:02:57,543 --> 00:02:58,177
STAY SECRET. 

93
00:02:58,177 --> 00:02:59,879
IS THAT WHAT WE SHOULD READ 

94
00:02:59,879 --> 00:03:00,480
INTO THAT. 

95
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:02,382
>> THE PRESIDENT HAS EXPRESSED 

96
00:03:02,382 --> 00:03:03,783
HIS VIEWS ON THAT. 

97
00:03:03,783 --> 00:03:05,585
I DON'T HAVE ANYTHING FURTHER 

98
00:03:05,585 --> 00:03:07,186
TO ADD. 

99
00:03:07,186 --> 00:03:11,057
>> IS THE PRESIDENT PLANNING ON 

100
00:03:11,057 --> 00:03:12,157
OR INTENT ON PARDONING PAUL 

101
00:03:12,157 --> 00:03:12,424
MANAFORT. 

102
00:03:12,424 --> 00:03:13,793
>> THE MANAFORT CASE HAS 

103
00:03:13,793 --> 00:03:19,631
NOTHING TO DO WITH THE 

104
00:03:19,631 --> 00:03:23,903
PRESIDENT OR HIS CAMPAIGN OR 

105
00:03:23,903 --> 00:03:25,171
THE WHITE HOUSE. 

106
00:03:25,171 --> 00:03:27,073
>> THE PRESIDENT COULD STILL 

107
00:03:27,073 --> 00:03:30,576
HAVE THE POWER TO PARDON 

108
00:03:30,576 --> 00:03:30,843
MANAFORT. 

109
00:03:30,843 --> 00:03:31,877
HAS HE DISCUSSED THAT? 

110
00:03:31,877 --> 00:03:32,812
HAS IT COME OUT? 

111
00:03:32,812 --> 00:03:35,114
>> I'M NOT AWARE OF ANY 

112
00:03:35,114 --> 00:03:36,582
CONVERSATIONS REGARDING THAT. 

113
00:03:36,582 --> 00:03:39,018
>> OTHER THAN WHEN HE WAS ASKED 

114
00:03:39,018 --> 00:03:41,220
BY A NEWS OUTLET EARLIER THIS 

115
00:03:41,220 --> 00:03:46,326
WEEK AND HE SAID THAT HE HADN'T 

116
00:03:46,326 --> 00:03:48,127
BEEN THINKING ABOUT THAT AT 

117
00:03:48,127 --> 00:03:48,327
ALL. 

118
00:03:48,327 --> 00:03:50,930
>> IN TIMES LIKE THIS, NOT THAT 

119
00:03:50,930 --> 00:03:53,499
THERE MANY TIMES LIKE THIS, THE 

120
00:03:53,499 --> 00:03:55,802
WHITE HOUSE IS TRYING TO FIGURE 

121
00:03:55,802 --> 00:03:58,071
OUT IF THERE NEEDS TO BE 

122
00:03:58,071 --> 00:03:59,472
INTERNAL ADJUSTMENTS TO DEAL 

123
00:03:59,472 --> 00:04:01,874
WITH THE POLITICAL -- WITH THE 

124
00:04:01,874 --> 00:04:03,509
HILL, WITH VOTERS, WITH 

125
00:04:03,509 --> 00:04:04,877
LAWMAKERS. 

126
00:04:04,877 --> 00:04:07,714
IS THE WHITE HOUSE MAKING ANY 

127
00:04:07,714 --> 00:04:08,514
ADJUSTMENTS IN TERMS OF 

128
00:04:08,514 --> 00:04:13,920
RESPONSIBILITIES OF CHIEFS OF 

129
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:15,254
STAFF, OF COMMUNICATIONS TO 

130
00:04:15,254 --> 00:04:16,322
DONORS, COMMUNICATIONS TO 

131
00:04:16,322 --> 00:04:21,761
SUPPORTERS, HOW YOU WOULD 

132
00:04:21,761 --> 00:04:22,729
RESPOND TO PROTECTIVELY AND 

133
00:04:22,729 --> 00:04:23,629
OFFENSIVELY TO -- 

134
00:04:23,629 --> 00:04:27,934
>> I WOULDN'T VIEW IT THAT WAY 

135
00:04:27,934 --> 00:04:28,334
AT ALL. 

136
00:04:28,334 --> 00:04:29,469
AND WOULD DISAGREE WITH THE 

137
00:04:29,469 --> 00:04:31,069
PREMISE OF YOUR QUESTION. 

138
00:04:31,069 --> 00:04:33,306
THE WHITE HOUSE IS FOCUSED ON 

139
00:04:33,306 --> 00:04:35,241
THE SAME THINGS THAT WE WERE 

140
00:04:35,241 --> 00:04:38,411
FOCUSED ON THE FIRST DAY WE GOT 

141
00:04:38,411 --> 00:04:38,644
HERE. 

142
00:04:38,644 --> 00:04:40,980
ANDS THAT GROWING THE ECONOMY 

143
00:04:40,980 --> 00:04:43,049
WHICH IS DOING EXTREME WELL. 

144
00:04:43,049 --> 00:04:43,850
PROTECTING THE BORDERS, 

145
00:04:43,850 --> 00:04:44,951
STRENGTHENING THE SAFETY AND 

146
00:04:44,951 --> 00:04:47,253
SECURITY OF ALL AMERICANS, 

147
00:04:47,253 --> 00:04:49,555
THOSE ARE THE THINGS THAT WE'RE 

148
00:04:49,555 --> 00:04:50,456
FOCUSED ON DAY ONE, JANUARY 

149
00:04:50,456 --> 00:04:54,660
20th AND THOSE ARE THE THINGS 

150
00:04:54,660 --> 00:04:56,062
WE'RE FOCUSED ON NOW. 

151
00:04:56,062 --> 00:04:58,364
>> I WANT TO CONGRATULATE YOU. 

152
00:04:58,364 --> 00:05:02,769
THIS IS YOUR 100th BRIEFING AND 

153
00:05:02,769 --> 00:05:08,741
THERE'S NO WAY THIS IS EASY -- 

154
00:05:08,741 --> 00:05:09,942
SEVERAL REPUBLICAN OPERATIVES 

155
00:05:09,942 --> 00:05:11,544
TOLD ME -- PREDICTIONS COULD 

156
00:05:11,544 --> 00:05:15,114
DEPRESS TURNOUT AND SERVE TO 

157
00:05:15,114 --> 00:05:18,584
MAKE A BLUE WAVE BIGGER. 

158
00:05:18,584 --> 00:05:21,553
ARE YOU FAMILIAR WITH ANY 

159
00:05:21,553 --> 00:05:22,154
REPUBLICAN OPERATIVES THAT 

160
00:05:22,154 --> 00:05:24,690
WOULD MAKE THIS STATEMENT.  

161
00:05:24,690 --> 00:05:26,292
IN THE THING THAT'S GOING TO 

162
00:05:26,292 --> 00:05:29,262
ENCOURAGE PEOPLE IS THE LACK OF 

163
00:05:29,262 --> 00:05:30,763
A MESSAGE BY DEMOCRATS. 

164
00:05:30,763 --> 00:05:33,599
THEY HAVE NOTHING TO RUN ON 

165
00:05:33,599 --> 00:05:35,067
OTHER THAN ATTACKING THE 

166
00:05:35,067 --> 00:05:35,367
PRESIDENT. 

167
00:05:35,367 --> 00:05:38,938
WE HAVE AN INCREDIBLE STORY TO 

168
00:05:38,938 --> 00:05:39,138
TELL. 

169
00:05:39,138 --> 00:05:39,805
THE ECONOMY IS BOOMING. 

170
00:05:39,805 --> 00:05:40,472
RECORD NUMBERS JUST TODAY. 

171
00:05:40,472 --> 00:05:41,674
WE'RE GOING TO CONTINUE 

172
00:05:41,674 --> 00:05:43,443
FOCUSING ON THE THINGS THAT 

173
00:05:43,443 --> 00:05:44,577
AMERICANS CARE ABOUT. 

174
00:05:44,577 --> 00:05:47,980
AND I THINK THAT WILL BE 

175
00:05:47,980 --> 00:05:49,281
CERTAINLY WHAT ENCOURAGES THEM. 

176
00:05:49,281 --> 00:05:50,983
AND CERTAINLY WHAT WILL HELP 

177
00:05:50,983 --> 00:05:53,586
PUSH REPUBLICANS TO DO WELL IN 

178
00:05:53,586 --> 00:05:53,886
NOVEMBER. 

179
00:05:53,886 --> 00:05:55,854
>> YESTERDAY THE PRESIDENT 

180
00:05:55,854 --> 00:05:57,557
STATED THAT ISRAEL WILL PAY A 

181
00:05:57,557 --> 00:06:00,860
PRICE FOR THE -- NOT SURE 

182
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:01,894
THAT'S AN EXACT QUOTE. 

183
00:06:01,894 --> 00:06:03,796
SHOULD ISRAEL BE CONCERNED THE 

184
00:06:03,796 --> 00:06:05,064
PRICE -- NOT PREPARED OR 

185
00:06:05,064 --> 00:06:05,865
WILLING TO PAY. 

186
00:06:05,865 --> 00:06:06,899
>> WE THINK THAT THE 

187
00:06:06,899 --> 00:06:09,402
PRESIDENT'S DECISION WAS THE 

188
00:06:09,402 --> 00:06:12,338
RIGHT ONE TO MOVE THE EMBASSY. 

189
00:06:12,338 --> 00:06:13,873
SOMETHING THAT OTHER PRESIDENTS 

190
00:06:13,873 --> 00:06:16,175
PROMISED AND FAILED TO DO AND 

191
00:06:16,175 --> 00:06:17,777
THIS IS A PRESIDENT DELIVERING 

192
00:06:17,777 --> 00:06:19,478
ON THE PROMISES. 

193
00:06:19,478 --> 00:06:20,480
>> WHAT PRICE MIGHT ISRAEL HAVE 

194
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:20,880
TO PAY. 

195
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:23,382
>> I DON'T HAVE ANYTHING 

196
00:06:23,382 --> 00:06:24,116
FURTHER FOR YOU. 

197
00:06:24,116 --> 00:06:26,518
>> THANKS A LOT, SARAH. 

198
00:06:26,518 --> 00:06:30,022
SINCE THE GUILTY VERDICTS IN 

199
00:06:30,022 --> 00:06:32,458
THE PAUL MANAFORT TRIAL. 

200
00:06:32,458 --> 00:06:35,127
THE PRESIDENT HAS SAID KIND 

201
00:06:35,127 --> 00:06:35,695
THINGS ABOUT HIM. 

202
00:06:35,695 --> 00:06:37,897
HE'S SAID HE FEELS BADLY FOR 

203
00:06:37,897 --> 00:06:38,931
WHAT HAPPENED TO HIM. 

204
00:06:38,931 --> 00:06:43,002
HE REFUSED TO BREAK IN ORDER TO 

205
00:06:43,002 --> 00:06:43,936
GET A DEAL. 

206
00:06:43,936 --> 00:06:48,374
HE TWEETED SUCH RESPECT FOR A 

207
00:06:48,374 --> 00:06:48,975
BRAVE MAN. 

208
00:06:48,975 --> 00:06:51,878
IS HE A CANDIDATE FOR A 

209
00:06:51,878 --> 00:06:52,411
PRESIDENTIAL PARDON. 

210
00:06:52,411 --> 00:06:54,013
>> THAT'S NOT UP FOR 

211
00:06:54,013 --> 00:06:54,313
DISCUSSION. 

212
00:06:54,313 --> 00:06:56,982
>> CAN I ASK YOU ABOUT THE -- 

213
00:06:56,982 --> 00:06:58,417
SOME DEMOCRATS ARE SAYING THAT 

214
00:06:58,417 --> 00:07:02,522
THE NOMINATION SHOULD BE PUT ON 

215
00:07:02,522 --> 00:07:04,624
HOLD BECAUSE OF THE LEGAL 

216
00:07:04,624 --> 00:07:05,257
DEVELOPMENTS YESTERDAY. 

217
00:07:05,257 --> 00:07:09,228
SENATOR-- PUT OUT A STATEMENT. 

218
00:07:09,228 --> 00:07:12,131
THIS PRESIDENT WHO IS AN 

219
00:07:12,131 --> 00:07:15,034
UNINDICTED COCONSPIRATOR IN A 

220
00:07:15,034 --> 00:07:16,102
CRIMINAL MATTER DOES NOT 

221
00:07:16,102 --> 00:07:18,370
DESERVE THE COURTESY OF -- 

222
00:07:18,370 --> 00:07:20,706
>> THIS IS A DESPERATE AND 

223
00:07:20,706 --> 00:07:22,408
PATHETIC ATTEMPT BY DEMOCRATS 

224
00:07:22,408 --> 00:07:25,845
TO OBSTRUCT A VERY HIGHLY 

225
00:07:25,845 --> 00:07:26,511
QUALIFIED NOMINEE. 

226
00:07:26,511 --> 00:07:28,714
THE HEARING DATE IS SEPTEMBER 

227
00:07:28,714 --> 00:07:28,947
4th. 

228
00:07:28,947 --> 00:07:30,349
AND JUDGE KAVANAUGH WILL BE 

229
00:07:30,349 --> 00:07:30,582
THERE. 

230
00:07:30,582 --> 00:07:32,451
>> TRADE TALKS BETWEEN THE 

231
00:07:32,451 --> 00:07:35,454
UNITED STATES AND CHINA ARE 

232
00:07:35,454 --> 00:07:35,721
RESUMING. 

233
00:07:35,721 --> 00:07:37,723
THE PRESIDENT EXPRESSED LOW 

234
00:07:37,723 --> 00:07:38,891
EXPECTATIONS FOR THE TALKS. 

235
00:07:38,891 --> 00:07:40,426
I'M WONDERING IF THAT HAS 

236
00:07:40,426 --> 00:07:43,429
CHANGED AND WHAT YOU WOULD LIKE 

237
00:07:43,429 --> 00:07:45,865
TO SEE COME OUT OF THESE 

238
00:07:45,865 --> 00:07:46,198
DISCUSSIONS. 

239
00:07:46,198 --> 00:07:46,832
>> AS YOU SAID THESE 

240
00:07:46,832 --> 00:07:48,434
CONVERSATIONS WITH CONTINUING. 

241
00:07:48,434 --> 00:07:51,704
I DON'T HAVE ANY ANNOUNCEMENTS 

242
00:07:51,704 --> 00:07:51,971
ON THEM. 

243
00:07:51,971 --> 00:07:52,371
THEY ARE ONGOING. 

244
00:07:52,371 --> 00:07:53,205
CERTAINLY WHAT WE'D LIKE TO SEE 

245
00:07:53,205 --> 00:07:55,508
IS BETTER TRADE DEALS FOR 

246
00:07:55,508 --> 00:07:55,941
UNITED STATES. 

247
00:07:55,941 --> 00:07:59,044
THE PRESIDENT WANTS TO SEE 

248
00:07:59,044 --> 00:08:01,147
FREE, FAIR, AND MORE RECIPROCAL 

249
00:08:01,147 --> 00:08:04,150
TRADE WITH OTHER COUNTRIES, AND 

250
00:08:04,150 --> 00:08:06,052
WE'LL CONTINUE IN THOSE 

251
00:08:06,052 --> 00:08:06,519
CONVERSATIONS. 

252
00:08:06,519 --> 00:08:09,956
>> DOES THE PRESIDENT FEEL 

253
00:08:09,956 --> 00:08:11,357
BETRAYED BY MICHAEL COHEN AND 

254
00:08:11,357 --> 00:08:13,192
IS IS CONCERNED ABOUT WHAT HE 

255
00:08:13,192 --> 00:08:14,226
MIGHT SAY TO ROBERT MUELLER. 

256
00:08:14,226 --> 00:08:17,663
>> I DON'T THINK THE PRESIDENT 

257
00:08:17,663 --> 00:08:18,864
IS CONCERNED AT ALL. 

258
00:08:18,864 --> 00:08:21,067
HE KNOWS HE'S DONE NOTHING 

259
00:08:21,067 --> 00:08:24,637
WRONG AND THERE'S NO COLLUSION. 

260
00:08:24,637 --> 00:08:27,039
AND WE'LL CONTINUE FOCUSING ON 

261
00:08:27,039 --> 00:08:28,741
THE THINGS AMERICANS CARE 

262
00:08:28,741 --> 00:08:28,974
ABOUT. 

263
00:08:28,974 --> 00:08:32,812
>> DO YOU ANTICIPATE A DEAL ON 

264
00:08:32,812 --> 00:08:33,044
NAFTA? 

265
00:08:33,044 --> 00:08:36,682
>> I'M NOT GOING TO GET AHEAD 

266
00:08:36,682 --> 00:08:38,616
OF ANY POTENTIAL ANNOUNCEMENT. 

267
00:08:38,616 --> 00:08:40,385
FOR DECADES, NAFTA HAS HARMED 

268
00:08:40,385 --> 00:08:41,486
AMERICAN WORKERRINGS, WE'RE 

269
00:08:41,486 --> 00:08:43,389
FOCUSED ON DEALING WITH THOSE 

270
00:08:43,389 --> 00:08:43,990
PROBLEMS. 

271
00:08:43,990 --> 00:08:45,091
AND WE'LL LET YOU KNOW. 

272
00:08:45,091 --> 00:08:48,494
>> IN HIS INTERVIEW TODAY, THE 

273
00:08:48,494 --> 00:08:51,130
PRESIDENT SAID HE FOUND OUT 

274
00:08:51,130 --> 00:08:52,698
ABOUT THE PAYMENTS MICHAEL 

275
00:08:52,698 --> 00:08:53,532
COHEN MADE LATER ON. 

276
00:08:53,532 --> 00:08:55,201
BUT HE'S ON TAPE DISCUSSING HOW 

277
00:08:55,201 --> 00:08:57,470
TO MAKE ONE OF THE PAYMENTS. 

278
00:08:57,470 --> 00:08:59,304
HOW DO YOU EXPLAIN THAT. 

279
00:08:59,304 --> 00:09:00,973
>> ONCE AGAIN I'VE COMMENTED ON 

280
00:09:00,973 --> 00:09:01,607
THIS PRETTY EXTENSIVELY. 

281
00:09:01,607 --> 00:09:05,277
WHAT I CAN TELL YOU IS THAT THE 

282
00:09:05,277 --> 00:09:07,880
PRESIDENT KID NOTHING WRONG. 

283
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:10,383
THERE ARE NO CHARGES, THERE'S 

284
00:09:10,383 --> 00:09:10,716
NO COLLUSION. 

285
00:09:10,716 --> 00:09:11,484
FOR ANYTHING BEYOND THAT, I 

286
00:09:11,484 --> 00:09:12,585
WOULD REFER YOU -- 

287
00:09:12,585 --> 00:09:14,487
>> RUDY GIULIANI IS NOT A 

288
00:09:14,487 --> 00:09:19,091
SPOKESPERSON FOR THE PRESIDENT. 

289
00:09:19,091 --> 00:09:19,358
YOU ARE. 

290
00:09:19,358 --> 00:09:20,859
>> I'M AWARE OF THAT. 

291
00:09:20,859 --> 00:09:22,595
>> ON THE GROUNDS -- CONFIRMED 

292
00:09:22,595 --> 00:09:24,597
THAT IT IS THE PRESIDENT SAYING 

293
00:09:24,597 --> 00:09:24,797
THAT. 

294
00:09:24,797 --> 00:09:26,365
>> ONCE AGAIN, I HAVE ADDRESSED 

295
00:09:26,365 --> 00:09:28,401
THIS A NUMBER OF TIMES BECAUSE 

296
00:09:28,401 --> 00:09:30,703
YOU CONTINUE TO ASK THE SAME 

297
00:09:30,703 --> 00:09:31,470
QUESTIONS OVER AND OVER. 

298
00:09:31,470 --> 00:09:34,273
I'M NOT GOING TO GIVE YOU A 

299
00:09:34,273 --> 00:09:34,706
DIFFERENT ANSWER. 

300
00:09:34,706 --> 00:09:38,010
THERE'S NO COLLUSION, THAT'S 

301
00:09:38,010 --> 00:09:41,514
WHAT I CAN TELL YOU. 

302
00:09:41,514 --> 00:09:44,216
IF YOU WANT SOMETHING FURTHER. 

303
00:09:44,216 --> 00:09:45,784
I WOULD REFER YOU -- 

304
00:09:45,784 --> 00:09:48,787
>> DID NO HAVE AFFAIRS -- 

305
00:09:48,787 --> 00:09:50,255
>> WE'VE ADDRESSED THIS A 

306
00:09:50,255 --> 00:09:50,655
NUMBER OF TIMES. 

307
00:09:50,655 --> 00:09:54,126
>> FIRST, YOU SAID THAT THERE 

308
00:09:54,126 --> 00:09:55,627
HAVE BEEN NO DISCUSSIONS ABOUT 

309
00:09:55,627 --> 00:09:57,730
POTENTIA PARDON FOR PAUL 

310
00:09:57,730 --> 00:09:57,997
MANAFORT. 

311
00:09:57,997 --> 00:10:01,434
SO YOU'RE NOT RULING IT OUT 

312
00:10:01,434 --> 00:10:01,734
ENTIRELY. 

313
00:10:01,734 --> 00:10:02,567
IF THERE'S NO DISCUSSIONS. 

314
00:10:02,567 --> 00:10:04,236
THE PRESIDENT HAS NOT SAID HE 

315
00:10:04,236 --> 00:10:05,170
WON'T DO IT. 

316
00:10:05,170 --> 00:10:06,405
IT'S POSSIBLE THAT THERE COULD 

317
00:10:06,405 --> 00:10:07,306
BE A PARDON. 

318
00:10:07,306 --> 00:10:09,174
>> THE ONLY COMMENT THAT THE 

319
00:10:09,174 --> 00:10:12,645
PRESIDENT HAS MADE ON THIS WAS 

320
00:10:12,645 --> 00:10:14,580
WHEN HE WAS ASKED BY A NEWS 

321
00:10:14,580 --> 00:10:18,316
OUTLET AND HE SAID NO HE WAS 

322
00:10:18,316 --> 00:10:19,651
NOT CONSIDERING THAT. 

323
00:10:19,651 --> 00:10:20,152
BEYOND THAT. 

324
00:10:20,152 --> 00:10:21,754
>> THAT WAS BEFORE PAUL 

325
00:10:21,754 --> 00:10:22,755
MANAFORT WAS CONVICTED ON EIGHT 

326
00:10:22,755 --> 00:10:26,058
OF THE 18 COUNTS AT THE TIME 

327
00:10:26,058 --> 00:10:28,961
WHEN THE PRESIDENT WAS ASKED 

328
00:10:28,961 --> 00:10:29,194
THAT. 

329
00:10:29,194 --> 00:10:29,828
I'M ASKING NOW THAT HE'S BEEN 

330
00:10:29,828 --> 00:10:30,162
CONVICTED -- 

331
00:10:30,162 --> 00:10:31,263
>> THERE HAVE BEEN NO 

332
00:10:31,263 --> 00:10:32,965
DISCUSSIONS AT THE WHITE HOUSE 

333
00:10:32,965 --> 00:10:33,866
ON THAT MATTER. 

334
00:10:33,866 --> 00:10:36,201
>> ON A DIFFERENT POINT. 

335
00:10:36,201 --> 00:10:39,839
LAST TIME WE WERE IN HERE YOU 

336
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:42,241
READ OFF SOME EX-OFFICIALS AND 

337
00:10:42,241 --> 00:10:44,443
ONE CURRENT OFFICIAL WHO THE 

338
00:10:44,443 --> 00:10:45,377
PRESIDENT WAS CONSIDERING 

339
00:10:45,377 --> 00:10:47,580
TAKING AWAY THEIR SECURITY 

340
00:10:47,580 --> 00:10:48,080
CLEARANCE. 

341
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:48,413
FIRST OF ALL. 

342
00:10:48,413 --> 00:10:49,849
WHO IS CONDUCTING THAT REVIEW 

343
00:10:49,849 --> 00:10:51,484
TO DETERMINE WHETHER OR NOT THE 

344
00:10:51,484 --> 00:10:52,952
SECURITY CLEARANCES WILL BE 

345
00:10:52,952 --> 00:10:53,185
PULLED. 

346
00:10:53,185 --> 00:10:56,388
AND SECOND OF ALL I WANTED TO 

347
00:10:56,388 --> 00:10:57,689
ASK YOU ABOUT A TWEET. 

348
00:10:57,689 --> 00:10:59,158
THE PRESIDENT THOUGHT THAT 

349
00:10:59,158 --> 00:11:01,761
JAMES CLAPPER IS BEING NICE TO 

350
00:11:01,761 --> 00:11:05,264
HIM SO THAT HE DOESN'T LOSE HIS 

351
00:11:05,264 --> 00:11:05,731
SECURITY CLEARANCE. 

352
00:11:05,731 --> 00:11:07,166
IS THAT A THREAT THAT HE'LL 

353
00:11:07,166 --> 00:11:08,066
LOSE HIS SECURITY CLEARANCE. 

354
00:11:08,066 --> 00:11:10,169
>> I DON'T HAVE ANY 

355
00:11:10,169 --> 00:11:10,770
ANNOUNCEMENTS ON THAT FRONT. 

356
00:11:10,770 --> 00:11:12,538
WHEN WE HAVE AN ANNOUNCEMENT 

357
00:11:12,538 --> 00:11:13,372
I'LL LET YOU KNOW. 

358
00:11:13,372 --> 00:11:14,573
>> WHO IS  DOING THE REVIEWS? 

359
00:11:14,573 --> 00:11:18,544
>> A NUMBER OF PEOPLE AT THE 

360
00:11:18,544 --> 00:11:18,911
WHITE HOUSE. 

361
00:11:18,911 --> 00:11:21,046
>> IN THE TWEET THIS MORNING, 

362
00:11:21,046 --> 00:11:23,249
THE PRESIDENT WAS PRAISING HIM 

363
00:11:23,249 --> 00:11:24,783
FOR THE REFUSING TO COOPERATE 

364
00:11:24,783 --> 00:11:27,586
IN A WAY THAT WOULD IMPLICATE 

365
00:11:27,586 --> 00:11:28,587
HIM, THE PRESIDENT. 

366
00:11:28,587 --> 00:11:31,357
IS THAT WHAT HE MEANT TO 

367
00:11:31,357 --> 00:11:31,757
SUGGEST? 

368
00:11:31,757 --> 00:11:33,259
DOESN'T THAT SEEM TO SUGGEST 

369
00:11:33,259 --> 00:11:34,860
THAT LOYALTY TO HIM IS MORE 

370
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:39,365
IMPORTANT THAN ABIDING WITH THE 

371
00:11:39,365 --> 00:11:40,165
LAW OR COOPERATING WITH THE 

372
00:11:40,165 --> 00:11:41,300
GOVERNMENT. 

373
00:11:41,300 --> 00:11:42,301
>> MANAFORT CASE HAS NOTHING TO 

374
00:11:42,301 --> 00:11:46,071
DO WITH THE WHITE HOUSE. 

375
00:11:46,071 --> 00:11:48,140
THE PRESIDENT HAS EXPRESSED HIS 

376
00:11:48,140 --> 00:11:48,541
VIEWS. 

377
00:11:48,541 --> 00:11:50,543
>> MICHAEL COHEN'S LAWYER HAS 

378
00:11:50,543 --> 00:11:52,878
SUGGESTED PUBLICLY THAT THERE'S 

379
00:11:52,878 --> 00:11:53,979
NEW EVIDENCE ABOUT 

380
00:11:53,979 --> 00:11:54,980
FOREKNOWLEDGE OF ELECTION 

381
00:11:54,980 --> 00:11:55,481
HACKING. 

382
00:11:55,481 --> 00:11:57,783
DOES THE WHITE HOUSE MAINTAIN 

383
00:11:57,783 --> 00:11:59,585
THERE WAS NO FOREKNOWLEDGE OF 

384
00:11:59,585 --> 00:12:04,690
ANY ELECTION HACKING DURING THE 

385
00:12:04,690 --> 00:12:04,990
CAMPAIGN. 

386
00:12:04,990 --> 00:12:05,957
>> I'M NOT AWARE OF ANYTHING. 

387
00:12:05,957 --> 00:12:07,193
>> GIVEN THAT FIVE CONVICTED 

388
00:12:07,193 --> 00:12:09,295
FELONIES ARE LINKED TO THE 

389
00:12:09,295 --> 00:12:10,595
PRESIDENT OR HIS CAMPAIGN AND 

390
00:12:10,595 --> 00:12:11,897
GIVEN THAT THE PRESIDENT 

391
00:12:11,897 --> 00:12:13,298
PROMISED TO HIRE THE BEST 

392
00:12:13,298 --> 00:12:13,766
PEOPLE. 

393
00:12:13,766 --> 00:12:16,302
DID HE FAIL TO LIVE UP TO THAT 

394
00:12:16,302 --> 00:12:16,569
PROMISE. 

395
00:12:16,569 --> 00:12:18,237
>> THE PRESIDENT HAS EMPLOYED 

396
00:12:18,237 --> 00:12:20,172
THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE IN HIS 

397
00:12:20,172 --> 00:12:21,941
LIFETIME AND HAD INCREDIBLE 

398
00:12:21,941 --> 00:12:23,475
SUCCESSES BOTH IN BUSINESS AND 

399
00:12:23,475 --> 00:12:26,244
IN THE PUBLIC SERVICE. 

400
00:12:26,244 --> 00:12:28,881
HE'S THE PRESIDENT OF THE 

401
00:12:28,881 --> 00:12:30,516
UNITED STATES, I THINK HE'S 

402
00:12:30,516 --> 00:12:31,183
DOING QUITE WELL. 

403
00:12:31,183 --> 00:12:35,087
>> I UNDERSTAND THAT YOU DON'T 

404
00:12:35,087 --> 00:12:35,788
WANT TO ANSWER THE SAME 

405
00:12:35,788 --> 00:12:37,823
QUESTION -- I DIDN'T HEAR A 

406
00:12:37,823 --> 00:12:39,257
RESPONSE TO THE QUESTION. 

407
00:12:39,257 --> 00:12:43,161
DID HE LIE TO THE AMERICAN 

408
00:12:43,161 --> 00:12:43,996
PEOPLE WHEN HE TALKED ABOUT 

409
00:12:43,996 --> 00:12:44,196
THIS. 

410
00:12:44,196 --> 00:12:45,998
>> NO AND THE PRESIDENT HAS 

411
00:12:45,998 --> 00:12:48,500
ADDRESSED THIS A NUMBER OF 

412
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:48,733
TIMES. 

413
00:12:48,733 --> 00:12:50,903
>> THE PRESIDENT FEELS BADLY 

414
00:12:50,903 --> 00:12:52,271
FOR COHEN AND MANAFORT. 

415
00:12:52,271 --> 00:12:54,073
ONE OF THE MEN PLEADED GUILTY 

416
00:12:54,073 --> 00:12:56,475
AND THE OTHER WAS FOUND GUILTY 

417
00:12:56,475 --> 00:12:59,011
OF TAX FRAUD WHICH ROBBED THE 

418
00:12:59,011 --> 00:13:01,847
AMERICAN PUBLIC OF TAX DOLLARS 

419
00:13:01,847 --> 00:13:02,314
THEY WERE OWED. 

420
00:13:02,314 --> 00:13:04,249
WHY DOES HE FEEL BAD FOR EITHER 

421
00:13:04,249 --> 00:13:05,217
OF THESE MEN. 

422
00:13:05,217 --> 00:13:06,919
>> THE PRESIDENT HAS EXPRESSED 

423
00:13:06,919 --> 00:13:09,922
HIS VIEWS ON THIS MATTER AND I 

424
00:13:09,922 --> 00:13:12,391
HAVE NOTHING ELSE TO ADD. 

425
00:13:12,391 --> 00:13:14,226
>> DOES HE BELIEVE THERE'S AN 

426
00:13:14,226 --> 00:13:15,928
INTRINSIC PROBLEM WITH THE 

427
00:13:15,928 --> 00:13:17,830
JUSTICE DEPARTMENT OR DOES HE 

428
00:13:17,830 --> 00:13:19,031
ONLY BELIEVES IF SOMEONE CLOSE 

429
00:13:19,031 --> 00:13:22,434
TO HIM IS A VICTIM OF THE 

430
00:13:22,434 --> 00:13:22,935
JUSTICE DEPARTMENT. 

431
00:13:22,935 --> 00:13:25,104
>> NO, I THINK WE SEEN A LOT OF 

432
00:13:25,104 --> 00:13:26,305
CONCERNS COME OUT OF THE 

433
00:13:26,305 --> 00:13:28,107
ACTIVITIES OF PEOPLE THAT 

434
00:13:28,107 --> 00:13:31,577
WORKED AT THE DEPARTMENT OF 

435
00:13:31,577 --> 00:13:32,211
JUSTICE. 

436
00:13:32,211 --> 00:13:34,012
WHETHER IT'S PETER STRZOK OR 

437
00:13:34,012 --> 00:13:35,347
LISA PAGE OR JAMES COMEY. 

438
00:13:35,347 --> 00:13:36,848
WE'VE WALKED THROUGH THOSE A 

439
00:13:36,848 --> 00:13:44,556
NUMBER OF TIMES AND IT'S GIVEN 

440
00:13:44,556 --> 00:13:46,525
CAUSE FOR A LOT OF AMERICANS. 

441
00:13:46,525 --> 00:13:48,827
>> THE PRESIDENT -- HIS OWN 

442
00:13:48,827 --> 00:13:50,529
JUSTICE DEPARTMENT IS NOT DOING 

443
00:13:50,529 --> 00:13:50,796
ITS JOB. 

444
00:13:50,796 --> 00:13:52,531
>> AGAIN, CERTAINLY THE 

445
00:13:52,531 --> 00:13:54,033
PRESIDENT HAS EXPRESSED HIS 

446
00:13:54,033 --> 00:13:56,635
VIEWS ON THIS MATTER AND HE'S 

447
00:13:56,635 --> 00:13:58,504
RAISED CONCERNS ABOUT A NUMBER 

448
00:13:58,504 --> 00:14:00,506
OF OTHER PROBLEMS THAT HE'S 

449
00:14:00,506 --> 00:14:01,406
SEEN WITHIN THE DEPARTMENT OF 

450
00:14:01,406 --> 00:14:02,107
JUSTICE. 

451
00:14:02,107 --> 00:14:04,009
>> I WANTED TO FOLLOW UP ABOUT 

452
00:14:04,009 --> 00:14:07,813
THE COMMENTS ON FOX NEWS WITH 

453
00:14:07,813 --> 00:14:11,016
REGARD TO THE PAYMENTS TO MS. 

454
00:14:11,016 --> 00:14:12,584
DANIELS AND MS. McDOUGAL. 

455
00:14:12,584 --> 00:14:14,853
WHEN DID HE LEARN ABOUT THEM? 

456
00:14:14,853 --> 00:14:17,056
AND ARE THERE ANY OTHER 

457
00:14:17,056 --> 00:14:18,223
PAYMENTS? 

458
00:14:18,223 --> 00:14:21,427
OR ARE THOSE THE ONLY TWO WOMEN 

459
00:14:21,427 --> 00:14:22,294
WHO RECEIVED MONEY? 

460
00:14:22,294 --> 00:14:23,729
>> ONCE AGAIN, I'VE ADDRESSED 

461
00:14:23,729 --> 00:14:27,032
ALL I'M GOING TO SAY ON THE 

462
00:14:27,032 --> 00:14:29,835
COHEN ISSUE FOR THOSE SPECIFIC 

463
00:14:29,835 --> 00:14:31,369
QUESTIONS, I WOULD REFER YOU TO 

464
00:14:31,369 --> 00:14:31,636
COUNSEL. 

465
00:14:31,636 --> 00:14:33,906
>> CAN'T WE BRING THEM IN HERE 

466
00:14:33,906 --> 00:14:35,507
FOR THE BRIEFING? 

467
00:14:35,507 --> 00:14:36,809
>> THEY DON'T WORK AT THE WHITE 

468
00:14:36,809 --> 00:14:37,042
HOUSE. 

469
00:14:37,042 --> 00:14:40,245
BUT I WOULD ENCOURAGE YOU TO 

470
00:14:40,245 --> 00:14:43,549
REACH OUT TO THEM. 

471
00:14:43,549 --> 00:14:44,984
>> GOING BACK TO THE SECURITY 

472
00:14:44,984 --> 00:14:45,284
CLEARANCES. 

473
00:14:45,284 --> 00:14:48,854
ALL SIGNS ARE THIS IS THE FIRST 

474
00:14:48,854 --> 00:14:53,525
TIME A PRESIDENT PERSONALLY HAS 

475
00:14:53,525 --> 00:14:55,761
BEEN HANDLING THE REMOVAL OF 

476
00:14:55,761 --> 00:14:56,361
SECURITY CLEARANCES. 

477
00:14:56,361 --> 00:14:58,063
IT'S USUALLY DONE BY SUPERIORS, 

478
00:14:58,063 --> 00:15:00,666
EVEN IN THE LAST TWO BIG 

479
00:15:00,666 --> 00:15:04,269
ESPIONAGE CASES OF THE COLD 

480
00:15:04,269 --> 00:15:05,004
WAR. 

481
00:15:05,004 --> 00:15:07,306
THE URBAN -- OF 1961 AND FELIX 

482
00:15:07,306 --> 00:15:10,108
-- OF 1990, THE SECRETARY OF 

483
00:15:10,108 --> 00:15:14,279
STATE PULLED THE SECURITY 

484
00:15:14,279 --> 00:15:15,981
CLEARANCES OF PEOPLE WHO WERE 

485
00:15:15,981 --> 00:15:16,949
ACCUSED OF ESPIONAGE. 

486
00:15:16,949 --> 00:15:19,685
YOU SAID THE OTHERS ARE 

487
00:15:19,685 --> 00:15:20,418
REVIEWING IT. 

488
00:15:20,418 --> 00:15:21,086
WHO ARE THE OTHERS? 

489
00:15:21,086 --> 00:15:22,988
AND DOES THE PRESIDENT TAKE A 

490
00:15:22,988 --> 00:15:25,691
PERSONAL ROLE IN THE POTENTIAL 

491
00:15:25,691 --> 00:15:27,059
REMOVAL OF SECURITY CLEARANCES? 

492
00:15:27,059 --> 00:15:28,794
>> CERTAINLY THE PRESIDENT HAS 

493
00:15:28,794 --> 00:15:30,262
THE CONSTITUTIONAL AUTHORITY TO 

494
00:15:30,262 --> 00:15:31,162
DO SO. 

495
00:15:31,162 --> 00:15:33,665
I KNOW THIS WILL COME AS A 

496
00:15:33,665 --> 00:15:36,301
SHOCK TO YOU BUT I'M NOT AWARE 

497
00:15:36,301 --> 00:15:37,970
OF THE DETAILS OF THOSE CASES 

498
00:15:37,970 --> 00:15:38,403
YOU OUTLINED. 

499
00:15:38,403 --> 00:15:40,406
BUT THE PRESIDENT HAS THE 

500
00:15:40,406 --> 00:15:42,007
AUTHORITY TO MAKE THE DECISION. 

501
00:15:42,007 --> 00:15:43,742
AND SHE'S CONSULTING WITH THE 

502
00:15:43,742 --> 00:15:47,279
NATIONAL SECURITY TEAM AND 

503
00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:49,281
MEMBERS OF HIS LEGAL TEAM. 

504
00:15:49,281 --> 00:15:51,984
>> IS HE ALSO CONSIDERING A 

505
00:15:51,984 --> 00:15:54,486
POLICY OF JUST SIMPLY HAVING 

506
00:15:54,486 --> 00:15:56,088
ALL SECURITY PASSES TURNED IN 

507
00:15:56,088 --> 00:15:57,823
WHEN SOMEONE LEAVES GOVERNMENT 

508
00:15:57,823 --> 00:15:58,190
SERVICE? 

509
00:15:58,190 --> 00:15:59,591
>> I'M NOT AWARE OF THAT. 

510
00:15:59,591 --> 00:16:01,093
AS A POLICY CERTAINLY WE WOULD 

511
00:16:01,093 --> 00:16:03,495
LIKE THE ABILITY IF NEEDED TO 

512
00:16:03,495 --> 00:16:06,899
BE ABLE TO CONSULT WITH 

513
00:16:06,899 --> 00:16:08,200
INDIVIDUALS ON NATIONAL 

514
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:08,667
SECURITY MATTERS. 

515
00:16:08,667 --> 00:16:10,803
BUT THEY DO FEEL THE TEAM HERE 

516
00:16:10,803 --> 00:16:12,871
THAT WE SHOULD LOOK AT THE 

517
00:16:12,871 --> 00:16:15,207
SECURITY CLEARANCE PROCESS AS A 

518
00:16:15,207 --> 00:16:15,974
WHOLE. 

519
00:16:15,974 --> 00:16:16,875
MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT THERE 

520
00:16:16,875 --> 00:16:18,510
ARE ROUGHLY 5 MILLION PEOPLE 

521
00:16:18,510 --> 00:16:19,411
THAT HAVE SECURITY CLEARANCES 

522
00:16:19,411 --> 00:16:21,413
HERE IN THE UNITED STATES AND 

523
00:16:21,413 --> 00:16:24,216
WE'D LIKE TO TAKE A LOOK AT THE 

524
00:16:24,216 --> 00:16:29,121
OVERALL PROCESS OF WHO HAS AND 

525
00:16:29,121 --> 00:16:31,323
WHO MAINTAINS THE SECURITY 

526
00:16:31,323 --> 00:16:31,890
CLEARANCES. 

527
00:16:31,890 --> 00:16:33,158
>> YOU'RE RIGHT ABOUT THE 

528
00:16:33,158 --> 00:16:34,026
PRESIDENT HAVING CONSTITUTIONAL 

529
00:16:34,026 --> 00:16:34,726
AUTHORITY ABOUT SECURITY 

530
00:16:34,726 --> 00:16:36,762
CLEARANCES AS WELL AS PARDONS. 

531
00:16:36,762 --> 00:16:38,530
I GUESS THE QUESTION I HAVE IS 

532
00:16:38,530 --> 00:16:41,200
EVEN THOUGH HE HAS THAT 

533
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:43,502
AUTHORITY, IS ANYBODY IN THE 

534
00:16:43,502 --> 00:16:44,703
WHITE HOUSE THOUGHT ABOUT 

535
00:16:44,703 --> 00:16:46,872
PUTTING TOGETHER A BOARD TO 

536
00:16:46,872 --> 00:16:49,975
LOOK AT SECURITY CLEARANCES FOR 

537
00:16:49,975 --> 00:16:53,312
FORMER PERSONNEL AND PARDONS AS 

538
00:16:53,312 --> 00:16:53,512
WELL? 

539
00:16:53,512 --> 00:16:54,913
THE PRESIDENT DOESN'T SEEM TO 

540
00:16:54,913 --> 00:16:58,617
BE CONSULTING THE PARDON 

541
00:16:58,617 --> 00:17:00,752
ATTORNEYS IN THE A.G.'S OFFICE. 

542
00:17:00,752 --> 00:17:01,920
HAS HE THOUGHT OF DOING 

543
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:04,656
SOMETHING MORE TRANSPARENT. 

544
00:17:04,656 --> 00:17:06,825
>> AS THE REVIEW OF THE 

545
00:17:06,825 --> 00:17:08,227
SECURITY CLEARANCES, THERE IS A 

546
00:17:08,227 --> 00:17:10,229
WORKING GROUP LOOKING AT THE 

547
00:17:10,229 --> 00:17:10,796
OVERALL SECURITY CLEARANCE 

548
00:17:10,796 --> 00:17:11,063
PROCESS. 

549
00:17:11,063 --> 00:17:12,798
AND WHO MAINTAINS THOSE AND 

550
00:17:12,798 --> 00:17:15,634
WHETHER OR NOT THOSE ARE NEEDED 

551
00:17:15,634 --> 00:17:17,236
ACROSS THE BOARD WITHIN 

552
00:17:17,236 --> 00:17:18,069
GOVERNMENT. 

553
00:17:18,069 --> 00:17:20,071
IN TERMS OF THE PARDON PROCESS, 

554
00:17:20,071 --> 00:17:22,174
GWEN, THE PRESIDENT HAS THE 

555
00:17:22,174 --> 00:17:23,275
AUTHORITY TO CARRY OUT THOSE 

556
00:17:23,275 --> 00:17:25,176
DECISIONS, HE TAKES INPUT AND 

557
00:17:25,176 --> 00:17:32,017
LOOKS AT THEM ON A CASE BY CASE 

558
00:17:32,017 --> 00:17:32,250
BASIS. 

559
00:17:32,250 --> 00:17:34,119
>> YOU SAID THERE ARE PEOPLE 

560
00:17:34,119 --> 00:17:35,620
LOOKING AT SECURITY CLEARANCES. 

561
00:17:35,620 --> 00:17:37,823
>> THERE ARE A NUMBER OF 

562
00:17:37,823 --> 00:17:38,523
MEMBERS ON THE TEAM. 

563
00:17:38,523 --> 00:17:41,026
I KNOW THE CHIEF OF STAFF IS 

564
00:17:41,026 --> 00:17:41,893
INVOLVED IN THE PROCESS. 

565
00:17:41,893 --> 00:17:44,730
>> EARLIER THIS WEEK, THE 

566
00:17:44,730 --> 00:17:45,731
PRESIDENT TOLD OUR COLLEAGUES 

567
00:17:45,731 --> 00:17:46,397
AT REUTERS -- 

568
00:17:46,397 --> 00:17:47,865
>> CAN YOU SPEAK UP? 

569
00:17:47,865 --> 00:17:50,135
>> THE PRESIDENT SAID TO 

570
00:17:50,135 --> 00:17:53,105
REUTERS THAT HE COULD RUN IT IN 

571
00:17:53,105 --> 00:17:54,706
REFERENCE TO THE MUELLER 

572
00:17:54,706 --> 00:17:55,908
INVESTIGATION. 

573
00:17:55,908 --> 00:17:58,010
>> THE PRESIDENT HAS SAID MANY 

574
00:17:58,010 --> 00:17:59,644
TIMES THAT HE'S CHOSEN TO 

575
00:17:59,644 --> 00:18:00,746
REMAIN UNINVOLVED IN THIS 

576
00:18:00,746 --> 00:18:02,614
PROCESS AND THAT'S WHERE WE ARE 

577
00:18:02,614 --> 00:18:03,815
NOW. 

578
00:18:03,815 --> 00:18:06,618
>> IS THAT AN INDICATION THAT 

579
00:18:06,618 --> 00:18:08,020
HE'S THINKING ABOUT TAKING 

580
00:18:08,020 --> 00:18:09,388
ACTION AGAINST ROBERT MUELLER? 

581
00:18:09,388 --> 00:18:10,722
>> I'M NOT AWARE OF ANY 

582
00:18:10,722 --> 00:18:11,423
CONVERSATION. 

583
00:18:11,423 --> 00:18:13,158
>> IS IT AN INDICATION THAT THE 

584
00:18:13,158 --> 00:18:17,963
PRESIDENT SEES HIMSELF AS ABOVE 

585
00:18:17,963 --> 00:18:18,230
THE LAW? 

586
00:18:18,230 --> 00:18:19,831
>> NOT AT ALL. 

587
00:18:19,831 --> 00:18:23,101
>> SOME LEGAL EXPERTS ARE 

588
00:18:23,101 --> 00:18:25,204
SAYING THE PRESIDENT IS CORRUPT 

589
00:18:25,204 --> 00:18:28,607
AND THAT THERE ARE GROUNDS FOR 

590
00:18:28,607 --> 00:18:28,940
IMPEACHMENT. 

591
00:18:28,940 --> 00:18:29,608
IS THE WHITE HOUSE CONCERNED 

592
00:18:29,608 --> 00:18:32,844
ABOUT -- THAT THAT COULD HAVE 

593
00:18:32,844 --> 00:18:34,947
AN IMPACT IN THE ELECTIONS, THE 

594
00:18:34,947 --> 00:18:35,747
MIDTERM ELECTIONS. 

595
00:18:35,747 --> 00:18:39,751
AND DOES THE WHITE HOUSE TAKE 

596
00:18:39,751 --> 00:18:40,852
THE ALLEGATIONS SERIOUSLY. 

597
00:18:40,852 --> 00:18:42,654
>> CERTAINLY WE TAKE 

598
00:18:42,654 --> 00:18:43,422
ALLEGATIONS SERIOUSLY. 

599
00:18:43,422 --> 00:18:46,158
THE IDEA OF AN IMPEACHMENT IS A 

600
00:18:46,158 --> 00:18:47,426
SAD ATTEMPT BY DEMOCRATS. 

601
00:18:47,426 --> 00:18:49,461
THE ONLY MESSAGE THEY HAVE 

602
00:18:49,461 --> 00:18:52,864
GOING INTO THE MIDTERMS AND A 

603
00:18:52,864 --> 00:18:54,466
GREAT REMINDER OF WHY AMERICANS 

604
00:18:54,466 --> 00:18:55,968
SHOULD SUPPORT LIKE-MINDED 

605
00:18:55,968 --> 00:18:57,369
CANDIDATES LIKE THE PRESIDENT 

606
00:18:57,369 --> 00:18:58,603
FOCUSED ON CONTINUING TO GROW 

607
00:18:58,603 --> 00:19:01,139
THE ECONOMY, CONTINUING TO 

608
00:19:01,139 --> 00:19:02,908
SECURE OUR BOARDS, AND FOCUS ON 

609
00:19:02,908 --> 00:19:06,477
THE SAFETY AND SECURITY OF ALL 

610
00:19:06,477 --> 00:19:06,778
AMERICANS. 

611
00:19:06,778 --> 00:19:08,146
THE BIGGEST CONTRAST YOU COULD 

612
00:19:08,146 --> 00:19:09,248
POSSIBLY MAKE IS THE MESSAGE OF 

613
00:19:09,248 --> 00:19:11,950
THE DEMOCRATS WHICH IS NOTHING 

614
00:19:11,950 --> 00:19:15,854
MORE THAN ATTACKING THE 

615
00:19:15,854 --> 00:19:17,256
PRESIDENT AND LOOKING AT CHEAP 

616
00:19:17,256 --> 00:19:18,557
POLITICAL STUNTS WHILE THIS 

617
00:19:18,557 --> 00:19:20,359
WHITE HOUSE ARE FOCUSED ON 

618
00:19:20,359 --> 00:19:23,762
DOING GOOD THINGS FOR THE 

619
00:19:23,762 --> 00:19:24,296
AMERICAN PEOPLE. 

620
00:19:24,296 --> 00:19:25,029
>> EARLIER THIS WEEK, THE 

621
00:19:25,029 --> 00:19:28,634
PRESIDENT HAS TOUGH WORDS OF 

622
00:19:28,634 --> 00:19:29,468
CREDIT TIM FOR THE FEDERAL 

623
00:19:29,468 --> 00:19:29,868
RESERVE CHAIRMAN. 

624
00:19:29,868 --> 00:19:32,904
WHEN YOU -- WHETHER OR NOT THE 

625
00:19:32,904 --> 00:19:35,007
PRESIDENT BROUGHT UP THE 

626
00:19:35,007 --> 00:19:36,073
CRITICISM WITH POWELL DIRECTLY. 

627
00:19:36,073 --> 00:19:38,810
>> I BELIEVE THE LAST TIME THEY 

628
00:19:38,810 --> 00:19:43,482
MET -- I'D HAVE TO DOUBLE CHECK 

629
00:19:43,482 --> 00:19:45,550
-- WAS AROUND THE TIME THAT 

630
00:19:45,550 --> 00:19:47,085
JEROME POWELL TOOK HIS PLACE. 

631
00:19:47,085 --> 00:19:49,554
>> HAS HE SPOKEN TO HIM. 

632
00:19:49,554 --> 00:19:53,358
>> I'M NOT AWARE OF THAT. 

633
00:19:53,358 --> 00:19:54,760
>> THANK YOU, SARA. 

634
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:57,162
ON VENEZUELA, IS THE PRESIDENT 

635
00:19:57,162 --> 00:19:58,529
PLANNING ON GETTING INVOLVED 

636
00:19:58,529 --> 00:19:58,964
úT 

637
00:19:58,964 --> 00:20:00,866
THERE'S MILLIONS FLEEING THE 

638
00:20:00,866 --> 00:20:01,133
COUNTRY. 

639
00:20:01,133 --> 00:20:02,868
WHAT IS THE U.S. STANCE ON 

640
00:20:02,868 --> 00:20:03,969
VENEZUELA? 

641
00:20:03,969 --> 00:20:05,103
>> THE UNITED STATES CONTINUES 

642
00:20:05,103 --> 00:20:07,239
TO SUPPORT VENEZUELA'S 

643
00:20:07,239 --> 00:20:08,340
NEIGHBORS AND PROVIDE EMERGENCY 

644
00:20:08,340 --> 00:20:09,941
AID AND SHELTER TO VENEZUELA 

645
00:20:09,941 --> 00:20:11,943
AND ALSO CONTINUES TO STAND 

646
00:20:11,943 --> 00:20:13,478
WITH THE PEOPLE OF VENEZUELA. 

647
00:20:13,478 --> 00:20:15,747
AND WE'RE GOING TO KEEP ALL 

648
00:20:15,747 --> 00:20:17,081
OPTIONS ON THE TABLE. 

649
00:20:17,081 --> 00:20:19,885
AND WE'LL KEEP YOU POSTED IF WE 

650
00:20:19,885 --> 00:20:20,485
HAVE FURTHER ANNOUNCEMENTS. 

651
00:20:20,485 --> 00:20:22,688
WE'RE GOING TO WRAP UP SO WE 

652
00:20:22,688 --> 00:20:23,955
CAN JOIN THE PRESIDENT FOR THE 

653
00:20:23,955 --> 00:20:32,597
MEDAL OF HONOR CEREMONY.    

654
00:20:32,597 --> 00:20:35,467
>> WHEN ASKED ABOUT MICHAEL 

655
00:20:35,467 --> 00:20:36,868
COHEN, SARAH HUCKABEE SANDERS' 

656
00:20:36,868 --> 00:20:39,638
WORDS WERE HE DID NOTHING 

657
00:20:39,638 --> 00:20:39,938
WRONG. 

658
00:20:39,938 --> 00:20:40,572
INTERESTING STATEMENT TO MAKE. 

659
00:20:40,572 --> 00:20:42,741
MANY CONCERNS AND QUESTIONS AS 

660
00:20:42,741 --> 00:20:44,443
TO WHETHER A SITTING PRESIDENT 

661
00:20:44,443 --> 00:20:46,411
CAN BE INDICTED OR CHARGED 

662
00:20:46,411 --> 00:20:46,811
WHILE IN OFFICE. 

663
00:20:46,811 --> 00:20:50,182
AND THE LINE FROM THE WHITE 

664
00:20:50,182 --> 00:20:55,287
HOUSE IS -- THE PRESIDENT DID 

665
00:20:55,287 --> 00:20:56,088
NOTHING WRONG. 

666
00:20:56,088 --> 00:20:57,356
AND ON PAUL MANAFORT TALKING 

667
00:20:57,356 --> 00:20:58,089
ABOUT PARDONED, SARAH HUCKABEE 

668
00:20:58,089 --> 00:21:00,258
SANDERS SAYS THE CASE HAS 

669
00:21:00,258 --> 00:21:03,562
NOTHING TO DO WITH THE 

670
00:21:03,562 --> 00:21:04,563
PRESIDENT HIMSELF. 

671
00:21:04,563 --> 00:21:07,299
AND ALSO TALKING ABOUT WHETHER 

672
00:21:07,299 --> 00:21:11,436
A PARDON MIGHT BE ISSUED BY THE 

673
00:21:11,436 --> 00:21:11,870
PRESIDENT. 

674
00:21:11,870 --> 00:21:14,439
SANDERS SAYING THIS HAS NOT 

675
00:21:14,439 --> 00:21:15,540
SOMETHING UP FOR DISCUSSION. 

676
00:21:15,540 --> 00:21:18,243
I WANT TO BRING IN WHITE HOUSE 

677
00:21:18,243 --> 00:21:20,044
CORRESPONDENT WEIJIA JIANG. 

678
00:21:20,044 --> 00:21:25,584
WHAT IS YOUR TAKE ON WHAT WE 

679
00:21:25,584 --> 00:21:27,552
HEARD FROM SARAH SANDERS? 

680
00:21:27,552 --> 00:21:28,987
>> CERTAINLY SARAH SANDERS WAS 

681
00:21:28,987 --> 00:21:29,287
PREPARED. 

682
00:21:29,287 --> 00:21:31,890
SHE KNEW WHAT WAS THE HIGHLIGHT 

683
00:21:31,890 --> 00:21:34,058
A OF THE BRIEFING. 

684
00:21:34,058 --> 00:21:37,028
AND REGARDLESS OF HOW REPORTERS 

685
00:21:37,028 --> 00:21:38,597
ASKED HER ABOUT MICHAEL COHEN 

686
00:21:38,597 --> 00:21:39,464
AND PAUL MANAFORT. 

687
00:21:39,464 --> 00:21:40,499
THE ANSWER WAS THE SAME. 

688
00:21:40,499 --> 00:21:43,134
THE PRESIDENT DID NOTHING WRONG 

689
00:21:43,134 --> 00:21:45,570
AND THERE WAS NO COLLUSION. 

690
00:21:45,570 --> 00:21:47,072
WHEN WE WERE ASKING QUESTIONS 

691
00:21:47,072 --> 00:21:50,242
ABOUT MICHAEL COHEN, AND THAT 

692
00:21:50,242 --> 00:21:52,177
IS NOT PART OF THE SPECIAL 

693
00:21:52,177 --> 00:21:53,311
COUNSEL'S INVESTIGATION, WE 

694
00:21:53,311 --> 00:21:54,379
WERE ASKING ABOUT THE EXCHANGE 

695
00:21:54,379 --> 00:21:58,783
OF MONEY, THE LINE WAS THERE 

696
00:21:58,783 --> 00:21:59,216
WAS NO COLLUSION. 

697
00:21:59,216 --> 00:22:02,487
AND IT'S VERY CLEAR THAT SARAH 

698
00:22:02,487 --> 00:22:04,489
SANDERS WAS PROGRAMMED AND 

699
00:22:04,489 --> 00:22:08,326
READY TO DELIVER THAT ANSWER 

700
00:22:08,326 --> 00:22:10,695
WITHOUT PROVIDING ANY REAL 

701
00:22:10,695 --> 00:22:12,697
ANSWERS DESPITE THESE TWO 

702
00:22:12,697 --> 00:22:14,299
MASSIVE LEGAL BOMBSHELLS THAT 

703
00:22:14,299 --> 00:22:14,866
JUST EXPLODED YESTERDAY. 

704
00:22:14,866 --> 00:22:19,171
>> IS THERE A WAY TO GAUGE HOW 

705
00:22:19,171 --> 00:22:20,171
CONCERNED THE WHITE HOUSE AND 

706
00:22:20,171 --> 00:22:21,473
PARTICULARLY THE PRESIDENT IS 

707
00:22:21,473 --> 00:22:24,676
ABOUT WHAT MICHAEL COHEN COULD 

708
00:22:24,676 --> 00:22:27,379
TELL THE MUELLER INVESTIGATION. 

709
00:22:27,379 --> 00:22:29,581
>> NOT IN THIS ROOM BECAUSE 

710
00:22:29,581 --> 00:22:31,315
SANDERS, ALONG WITH OTHER 

711
00:22:31,315 --> 00:22:31,849
OFFICIALS, THE PRESIDENT 

712
00:22:31,849 --> 00:22:33,418
HIMSELF, HAVE INDICATED THEY 

713
00:22:33,418 --> 00:22:35,587
BELIEVE THAT MICHAEL COHEN IS 

714
00:22:35,587 --> 00:22:36,787
NOT A CREDIBLE WITNESS. 

715
00:22:36,787 --> 00:22:38,690
THEY DON'T BELIEVE HE HAS 

716
00:22:38,690 --> 00:22:40,492
ANYTHING TO OFFER 

717
00:22:40,492 --> 00:22:42,527
INVESTIGATORS. 

718
00:22:42,527 --> 00:22:47,032
AND THEY'RE TRYING TO PAINT HIM 

719
00:22:47,032 --> 00:22:47,332
AS A LIAR. 

720
00:22:47,332 --> 00:22:50,001
THEY ARE NOT EXPRESSING ANY 

721
00:22:50,001 --> 00:22:50,268
CONCERN. 

722
00:22:50,268 --> 00:22:54,072
IT'S INTERESTING TO LOOK AT THE 

723
00:22:54,072 --> 00:22:54,773
PRESIDENT'S LANGUAGE WHEN IT 

724
00:22:54,773 --> 00:22:55,874
COMES TO BOTH MEN. 

725
00:22:55,874 --> 00:22:57,876
PAINTING PAUL MANAFORT AS A 

726
00:22:57,876 --> 00:22:58,376
VICTIM. 

727
00:22:58,376 --> 00:23:00,178
HE WAS BADLY TREATED AND THIS 

728
00:23:00,178 --> 00:23:01,479
SHOULDN'T HAVE HAPPENED. 

729
00:23:01,479 --> 00:23:03,415
AND BRINGING UP THE FACT THIS 

730
00:23:03,415 --> 00:23:05,116
WAS A 12-YEAR-OLD TAX CASE. 

731
00:23:05,116 --> 00:23:06,951
I WANTED TO ASK HER ABOUT WHY 

732
00:23:06,951 --> 00:23:10,922
THE AGE OF A CRIME MATTERS IF 

733
00:23:10,922 --> 00:23:13,592
IT'S COVERED BY THE STATUTE OF 

734
00:23:13,592 --> 00:23:15,026
LIMITATIONS WITH THIS 

735
00:23:15,026 --> 00:23:15,326
PRESIDENT. 

736
00:23:15,326 --> 00:23:18,897
IN TERMS OF HOW CONCERNED HE 

737
00:23:18,897 --> 00:23:20,198
IS, CERTAINLY IN THIS ROOM, 

738
00:23:20,198 --> 00:23:22,601
SARAH SANDERS' MESSAGE IS THAT 

739
00:23:22,601 --> 00:23:24,602
HE IS NOT CONCERNED. 

740
00:23:24,602 --> 00:23:25,970
HE HAS NOT DONE ANYTHING WRONG. 

741
00:23:25,970 --> 00:23:27,372
>> IT WAS ALSO INTERESTING 

742
00:23:27,372 --> 00:23:30,175
BECAUSE THE PRESIDENT CLAIMS HE 

743
00:23:30,175 --> 00:23:34,212
LEARNED ABOUT THE PAYMENTS 

744
00:23:34,212 --> 00:23:35,947
AFTER THE FACT EVEN THOUGH 

745
00:23:35,947 --> 00:23:36,815
THERE'S TAPED RECORDINGS 

746
00:23:36,815 --> 00:23:37,782
TALKING ABOUT IT. 

747
00:23:37,782 --> 00:23:41,820
>> THIS ADDS TO THE SAGA OF 

748
00:23:41,820 --> 00:23:43,822
WHEN THE PRESIDENT KNEW WHAT 

749
00:23:43,822 --> 00:23:44,989
ABOUT THOSE PAYMENTS. 

750
00:23:44,989 --> 00:23:46,691
THE BIG HEADLINE TODAY FROM HIM 

751
00:23:46,691 --> 00:23:49,294
IS THAT IT DOESN'T MATTER WHEN 

752
00:23:49,294 --> 00:23:50,328
THE PAYMENTS WERE MADE. 

753
00:23:50,328 --> 00:23:54,132
THE MONEY DID NOT COME FROM 

754
00:23:54,132 --> 00:23:55,900
CAMPAIGN FINANCE. 

755
00:23:55,900 --> 00:23:58,036
IT CAME FROM HIM. 

756
00:23:58,036 --> 00:23:58,903
SO IT DOESN'T MATTER. 

757
00:23:58,903 --> 00:24:00,004
THAT'S NOT TRUE, RIGHT? 

758
00:24:00,004 --> 00:24:01,439
THERE'S NO CLEAR DISTINCTION OR 

759
00:24:01,439 --> 00:24:03,374
WAY TO DETERMINE WHERE THE 

760
00:24:03,374 --> 00:24:05,577
MONEY CAME FROM WHEN THE 

761
00:24:05,577 --> 00:24:07,212
PRESIDENT HIMSELF AS A PUBLIC 

762
00:24:07,212 --> 00:24:10,615
CITIZEN FUNNELED SO MUCH MONEY 

763
00:24:10,615 --> 00:24:12,550
INTO HIS OWN CAMPAIGN. 

764
00:24:12,550 --> 00:24:15,052
AND IN TERMS OF WHAT MATTERS 

765
00:24:15,052 --> 00:24:17,055
HERE, IT'S WHAT COHEN HAS NOW 

766
00:24:17,055 --> 00:24:18,723
POLICE DEPARTMENT GUILTY TO AND 

767
00:24:18,723 --> 00:24:19,624
HE BROUGHT THE PRESIDENT INTO 

768
00:24:19,624 --> 00:24:21,226
THOSE ACTIONS SAYING IT WAS THE 

769
00:24:21,226 --> 00:24:27,298
RESULT OF THE DIRECTION OF THE 

770
00:24:27,298 --> 00:24:27,599
PRESIDENT. 

771
00:24:27,599 --> 00:24:29,867
AND THEY ACTED IN COORDINATION. 

772
00:24:29,867 --> 00:24:32,103
AND SO SARAH SANDERS AGAIN SAID 

773
00:24:32,103 --> 00:24:34,806
SHE WOULD REFER THOSE QUESTION 

774
00:24:34,806 --> 00:24:36,474
TO THE OUTSIDE COUNSEL WITHOUT 

775
00:24:36,474 --> 00:24:37,809
PROVIDING ANSWERS ABOUT THE 

776
00:24:37,809 --> 00:24:39,944
TIMELINE THAT CONTINUES TO 

777
00:24:39,944 --> 00:24:42,447
CHANGE ABOUT WHEN THE PRESIDENT 

778
00:24:42,447 --> 00:24:44,549
KNEW WHAT IN REGARD TO THE 

779
00:24:44,549 --> 00:24:44,816
PAYMENTS. 

780
00:24:44,816 --> 00:24:46,952
HE SAID ABOARD AIR FORCE ONE HE 

781
00:24:46,952 --> 00:24:49,754
DID NOT KNOW ABOUT THE 

782
00:24:49,754 --> 00:24:50,255
PAYMENTS. 

783
00:24:50,255 --> 00:24:52,257
LATER ON HE ACKNOWLEDGED 

784
00:24:52,257 --> 00:24:53,625
REIMBURSING COHEN FOR THE 

785
00:24:53,625 --> 00:24:53,892
PAYMENTS. 

786
00:24:53,892 --> 00:24:55,827
AND SO EVEN THOUGH THAT 

787
00:24:55,827 --> 00:24:57,128
DISCREPANCY WAS BROUGHT UP 

788
00:24:57,128 --> 00:25:00,231
AGAIN TODAY, SANDERS SAID MANY 

789
00:25:00,231 --> 00:25:02,334
TIMES THAT THE PRESIDENT DID 

790
00:25:02,334 --> 00:25:02,601
NOT LIE. 

791
00:25:02,601 --> 00:25:06,204
>> I WANT TO ASK YOU ABOUT 

792
00:25:06,204 --> 00:25:07,405
SUPREME COURT NEWS. 

793
00:25:07,405 --> 00:25:08,773
WE KNOW DEMOCRATS ARE PUSHING 

794
00:25:08,773 --> 00:25:12,210
HARD TO SAY THAT IF PRESIDENT 

795
00:25:12,210 --> 00:25:13,277
TRUMP IS CONSIDERED A 

796
00:25:13,277 --> 00:25:14,746
COCONSPIRATOR, HE SHOULDN'T BE 

797
00:25:14,746 --> 00:25:17,449
ALLOWED TO PICK FOR THE SUPREME 

798
00:25:17,449 --> 00:25:17,682
COURT. 

799
00:25:17,682 --> 00:25:19,651
HAVE WE HEARD ANYTHING FROM THE 

800
00:25:19,651 --> 00:25:19,984
WHITE HOUSE? 

801
00:25:19,984 --> 00:25:21,352
>> THE WHITE HOUSE BRUSHED IT 

802
00:25:21,352 --> 00:25:22,520
OFF. 

803
00:25:22,520 --> 00:25:25,156
YOU HEARD SARAH SANDERS SAYING 

804
00:25:25,156 --> 00:25:28,560
THIS IS A PATHETIC ATTEMPT ON 

805
00:25:28,560 --> 00:25:31,763
THE PART OF DEMOCRATS TO 

806
00:25:31,763 --> 00:25:33,331
TAKEAWAY FROM THE PRESIDENT'S 

807
00:25:33,331 --> 00:25:34,366
NOMINEE. 

808
00:25:34,366 --> 00:25:36,000
BUT THESE NEW DEVELOPMENTS 

809
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,902
DIDN'T COME OUT OF NOWHERE. 

810
00:25:37,902 --> 00:25:39,337
THEY RESULTED FROM WHAT 

811
00:25:39,337 --> 00:25:40,839
HAPPENED YESTERDAY AND PAIRED 

812
00:25:40,839 --> 00:25:42,207
WITH JUDGE KAVANAUGH'S HISTORY 

813
00:25:42,207 --> 00:25:44,609
OF WHAT HE HAS WRITTEN IN 

814
00:25:44,609 --> 00:25:45,910
ACADEMIC ARTICLES AND WHAT HE 

815
00:25:45,910 --> 00:25:47,078
HAS SAID PUBLICLY ABOUT WHAT HE 

816
00:25:47,078 --> 00:25:53,151
BELIEVES THE PRESIDENT HAS TO 

817
00:25:53,151 --> 00:25:57,355
DO WHEN IT COMES TO CRIMINAL 

818
00:25:57,355 --> 00:25:57,722
INVESTIGATIONS. 

819
00:25:57,722 --> 00:25:58,957
HE DOES NOT BELIEVE THAT 

820
00:25:58,957 --> 00:26:00,058
PRESIDENTS OUGHT TO ALWAYS BE 

821
00:26:00,058 --> 00:26:01,960
PART OF THOSE BECAUSE THEY 

822
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:04,062
MIGHT BE A DISTRACTION TO THE 

823
00:26:04,062 --> 00:26:04,329
PRESIDEN. 

824
00:26:04,329 --> 00:26:05,563
AND THAT'S WHY DEMOCRATS ARE 

825
00:26:05,563 --> 00:26:06,364
CONCERNED AND WHY THEY'RE 

826
00:26:06,364 --> 00:26:09,434
BRINGING THIS UP RIGHT NOW THAT 

827
00:26:09,434 --> 00:26:11,769
THEY ARE CONCERNED THAT A 

828
00:26:11,769 --> 00:26:13,238
POTENTIAL SUPREME COURT JUDGE 

829
00:26:13,238 --> 00:26:16,841
DOES NOT BELIEVE EVEN IF A 

830
00:26:16,841 --> 00:26:18,043
PRESIDENT IS SUBPOENAED HE HAS 

831
00:26:18,043 --> 00:26:19,410
TO ANSWER TO THAT. 

832
00:26:19,410 --> 00:26:21,980
AND THE WHITE HOUSE IS NOT 

833
00:26:21,980 --> 00:26:23,682
REACTING TO THAT STRONGLY, 

834
00:26:23,682 --> 00:26:25,784
SAYING THIS IS JUST ANOTHER 

835
00:26:25,784 --> 00:26:28,887
GAME THAT THE DEMOCRATS ARE 

836
00:26:28,887 --> 00:26:31,256
PLAYING TRYING TO BLOCK THE 

837
00:26:31,256 --> 00:26:32,257
NOMINEE. 

838
00:26:32,257 --> 00:26:33,358
>> AND SEPTEMBER 4th HEARINGS 

839
00:26:33,358 --> 00:26:34,592
ON THE BOOKS. 

840
00:26:34,592 --> 00:26:35,560
WEIJIA JIANG, THANK YOU FOR

BREAK.
