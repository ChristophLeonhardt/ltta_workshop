Dana: THE FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION TAKING AIM AT LEADING PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANIES AS THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION VOWS TO LOWER THE COST OF PRESCRIPTION DRUGS. THE F.D.A. PUBLICLY CALLING OUT FIRMS THAT BLOCK EFFORTS TO PRODUCE GENERIC VERSIONS OF MANY POPULAR MEDICATIONS. DR. SCOTT GOTTLIEB IS COMMISSIONER OF THE FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION AND JOINS ME NOW. THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE. THANK YOU. Dana: YOU WERE GOING TO BE ON LATE LAST WEEK AND BECAUSE OF THE UNFORTUNATE, THE SAD SITUATION IN TEXAS WE WEREN'T ABLE TO DO THIS. BUT JUST LAST WEEK YOU MADE AN ANNOUNCEMENT SAYING THAT THE ISSUE OF GETTING DRUGS TO GENERICS IS A HIGH PRIORITY AND IT'S THE BEST WAY TO TRY TO GET THE PRICES DOWN. HOW WAS THAT ACTUALLY MET IN TERMS OF REACTION FROM THE PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANIES? WE ARE TAKING STEPS TO BRING COMPETITION IN THE MARKET ACROSS A RANGE OF DIFFERENT EFFORTS. LAST WEEK WE PUBLISHED THE NAMES OF COMPANY WHERE GENERIC FIRMS COME TO US TELLING US THEY ARE HAVING PROBLEMS GETTING ACCESS TO THE DOSES OF THE BRAND OF THE COMPANY DRUGS THEY NEED TO DO CLINICAL STUDIES TO GET THE GENERIC DRUGS ON THE MARKET IN THE FIRST PLACE. SO WE KNOW THAT SOMETIMES COMPANIES ADOPT TACTICS TO MAKE IT HARD FOR THE GENERIC COMPANIES TO GET THE CLOSAGE CLOSAGE DOSAGE FOR THE APPROVAL. SO WE PUBLISH A LIST OF THE 50 DRUGS WHERE THE GENERIC FIRMS ARE HAVING A HARD TIME. Dana: THE O.E.C.D., THE ORGANIZATION FOR ECONOMIC COOPERATION AND DEVELOPMENT SAYS THAT THE AVERAGE CITIZEN'S PRESCRIPTION DRUG COST IN 2015 IN DIFFERENT COMPANIES, U.K. IS $479. AND THE UNITED STATES IS $1,116. DO YOU THINK IF YOU WERE ABLE TO GET MORE OF THE DRUGS TO THE GENERICS THAT THE UNITED STATES, COMMITMENT ON THAT WOULD DRAMATICALLY DECLINE? THERE IS NOT A SILVER BULLET HERE. THERE IS NO SINGLE SOLUTION. BUT GETTING MORE COMPETITION IN THE MARKET HAS AN IMPACT ON THE PRICES. THIS IS NOT JUST JEER IF GENERIC DRUGS. IT'S ALSO BRANDED DRUGS. WE HAVE TO HAVE PRICE COMPETITION. PEOPLE WITH MONOPOLIES DON'T Dana: LET ME ASK ABOUT ONE OTHER THING. THE HOUSE PASSED THE RIGHT TO TRY BILL. TAKE A LISTEN TO PRESIDENT TRUMP ON THAT THE OTHER DAY. President Trump: RIGHT TO TRY PASSED. WE'LL SIGN IT POSSIBLE SOMETIME NEXT WEEK. THIS GIVES PEOPLE HOPE. WE CAN GO, THEY WILL SIGN A WAIVER AND THEY WILL USE WHAT THEY NEED. AND IN THIS CASES THEY WILL BE HELPED. Dana: THIS HAS BEEN A BIG PRIORITY FOR SOME FOR A LONG TIME. DO YOU THINK IT WILL HAVE AN IMPACT ON PEOPLE SEEKING SOME SORT OF HOPE IN TRIALS? WE THINK IT WOULD. WE HAVE A LONG-STANDING COMMITMENT TO TRY TO PROVIDE PROMISING DRUGS TO PARENTS WHO ARE OUT OF OPTIONS AND HAVE TERMINAL CONDITIONS. WE DO A GOOD JOB OF THAT. WE GET A LOT OF DRUGS TO PEOPLE FACING LONG ODDS OTHER TERMINAL DISEASES. WE THINK THIS IS A WAY TO GET ACCESS TO PRODUCTS IN CERTAIN SITUATIONS AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO IMPLEMENT IT. Dana: I'LL ASK ABOUT ANOTHER TOPIC SURE TO GET ATTENTION IF IT DOES SPREAD. THAT IS THE ISSUE OF EBOLA. IN CONGO THERE HAVE BEEN A COUPLE OF CASES THAT HAVE COME UP, THAT FORCES THERE, THE HEALTHCARE FORCES ARE TRYING TO CONTAIN IT. WHAT SORT OF RISKS DO WE HAVE HERE IN THE UNITED STATES IF THIS DOES NOT STAY CONTAINED? WELL, I THINK THE RISK TO US IN THE U.S. IS MINIMAL. BUT WE ARE NOT OUT OF THE WOODS WITH RESPECT TO THE D.R.C. THERE ARE SOME CASES POPPED UP THERE THAT ARE UNACCOUNTED FOR AND THAT MEANS WE HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO TRACE BACK HOW THE PEOPLE GOT THE INFECTION. SO THAT LEAVES OPEN TO QUESTION THERE MAY BE ADDITIONAL PEOPLE WHO ARE GOING TO COME DOWN WITH EBOLA THERE AND ADDITIONAL PEOPLE WHO ARE INFECTED. WE HAVE HAD A PARADIGM CHANGE. WE HAVE GONE FROM POSTURE OF CONTAINMENT TO ONE WE ARE ABLE TO OFFER PROTECTION WITH A NEW VACCINE. Dana: HOW IS THAT ABLE TO GET TO THE PEOPLE THERE? I KNOW DISTRIBUTION TO THIS TYPE OF VACCINE IS SOMETIMES DIFFICULT IN AFRICA. THIS ONE IN PARTICULAR BECAUSE IT HAS TO BE KEPT IN A VERY COLD TEMPERATURE. SO THEY HAVE BEEN ABLE TO DO IT. THEY GOT IT TO THE MAJOR CITY. UP TO 8,000 DOSES IN. THERE ARE MANY MORE DOSES THEY COULD BRING IN, IF THEY HAVE TO. THEY HAVE BEEN ABLE TO BRING IN THE LOGISTICS TO GET THE VACCINE DISTRIBUTED TO THE PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN IN CONTACT WITH SOME OF THOSE
