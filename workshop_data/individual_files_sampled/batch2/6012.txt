it's been a hundred and forty nine days since Donald Trump signed the original executive order to revoke visas and immediately halt travel from seven Muslim countries after multiple courts ruled the ban unconstitutional the administration watered it down but the courts still turned him down that is until this Monday is a no doubt major victory for the Trump administration as the High Court now has lifted the injunction on the travel ban now contrary to what trumpets claim this is not a major victory especially because the original ban was supposed to keep out Muslims you know until we figure things out now this version will still enact a banned travel from six Muslim nations but I guess Trump is exactly the kind of shitty master negotiator who would consider this a W because this version is very watered-down because the Supreme Court added a provision that the ban won't affect people with bona fide relationships with people or businesses in the United States if there is some pressing need from one of the four nationals from any one of these six countries they will be permitted to do so now enforcing that distinction will be problematic while issuing visas for new applicants because even though this provision was included to reduce confusion the historically incompetent TSA remains woefully underprepared to abruptly stop this many people from coming into the United States to be exact since 2006 900,000 people have traveled to the u.s. from these nations however as soon as the executive order was issued without any accompanying guidelines or protocols for enforcement chaos obviously ensued as thousands of travelers were abruptly stopped from entering the United States take Sudanese mr. and alameen for example she's a green card holder who was mid-flight when Trump put his order in effect I was questioned extensively about whether or not I knew of radical groups in Sudan I was asked to get share my social media handles it was a very uncomfortable pat-down I was touched in my chest and groin area and then I was handcuffed briefly and I imagine the years of vetting a Muslim refugee has to go through as they make the excruciatingly ly difficult decision to leave their friends and some family members behind because they look to us their foreign occupiers as one final Hail Mary for a better life and now some dick a TSA officer is standing in their way like an overzealous power-drunk nightclub bouncer was like we don't get paid enough to do this but I still have to touch you in your penis area just because the press it wants to use Muslims to fearmonger to his base of angry racist Hicks I will give it to the TSA though there's there's one thing that they're very good at and it's instagramming shit they find in people's luggage or things travelers ask if they can bring on board a plane also the TSA follows me on Instagram just kidding but you should god I'm shameless moving on you might say you're more concerned with the feelings of foreigners and the safety of Americans you're probably a Democrat because if we were truly concerned with safety instead of focusing on refugees from any of these countries we'd focus on white terror we set you free we didn't start slavery we ended it because domestically the real killer is terror committed on behalf of a cause that the u.s. government has historically never been really opposed to white nationalists was wrong it makes makes a way of bringing to an end a nation culture white nationalists affiliated killers have taken a hundred and nineteen live since September 12 2001 and are responsible for far more deaths than refugees from these nations which have killed and you might have guessed this zero or if Trump truly gave a fuck about these countries and their ties to terrorism we'd absolutely include Saudi Arabia in the list of banned countries Saudi is the biggest state sponsor of terrorism 15 of the 19 hijackers on 9/11 were Saudi nationalists but Saudi Arabia unlike these seven states that are really poor is stupid rich so rich that they just recently signed off on a three hundred and fifty billion dollar arms deal to escalate their conflict in Yemen a conflict in which they apply inhumane tactics like starvation to the innocent civilians of Yemen that we turn a blind eye to so the moral of the story is even if you take down a tower or two the US will still favor your kingdom as long as you're rich enough to pay the US government hush money the other reason why I mentioned the Saudi exemption is because it's the clearest indication that this band has absolutely nothing to do with national security and everything to do with fear-mongering instead because if national security was Donald's chief concern he would have spent the past couple of months trying to figure out what the hell is going on instead of sword dancing with Saudi monarchs in between his golf outings or if Donald really cared about the safety of America he'd fill the 16 high-up vacant positions of Department of Homeland Security you've heard of the DHS it's it's that government agency we created to prevent terror attacks also Donald cannot blame the Democrats so there's either even though he likes to eight of the positions don't even have a nominee but I guess it should come as no surprise that the agency responsible for handling this executive order is only half-filled since we have a half brain president doing a half-assed job after winning a half victory as a matter of fact none of this should come as a surprise to anyone during his campaign Trump repeatedly used Muslims as a political punching bag so when the White House says that it isn't discriminatory that's absolutely bullshit the ban was never about safety was never about taking a pause to reconsider immigration policies it was just to point the finger at another group of non-white problems while the GOP advances their lifelong goals of gutting federal agencies that are actually meant to protect citizens and our consumer interest or rip health care away from Americans who need it to give tax breaks to the wealthy few who don't ironically the Muslim ban was supposed to go on for 90 days to figure things out now we don't know how long it will go on until the Supreme Court figures things out I'm ass on piker please share this video with your friends if you think the Muslim ban is unconstitutional please don't forget to follow me on instagram anna sandeep Iker and on twitter tucson the Hun and this has been the breakdown
