00:00:03,341 --> 00:00:06,777
YOU DON'T TREAT YOURSELF WITH

2
00:00:06,778 --> 00:00:07,277
RESPECT.

3
00:00:07,278 --> 00:00:09,112

TO ANOTHER RESTAURANT.

13
00:00:39,877 --> 00:00:44,881
TARGETED WITH THESE WANTED

14
00:00:44,882 --> 00:00:48,618

16
00:00:51,389 --> 00:00:53,357
WHAT ARE YOU TELLING OTHER

CITIZEN'S ARREST.

19
00:01:08,606 --> 00:01:09,606
ANYTHING THAT VIOLATED THE LAW.

20
00:01:09,607 --> 00:01:10,841
HE DIDN'T.

21
00:01:10,842 --> 00:01:13,877
HE IS A POLICY GUY.

22
00:01:13,878 --> 00:01:15,779
YOU LABELED HIM WELL A MOMENT

23
00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:16,113
AGO.

24
00:01:16,114 --> 00:01:20,751
HE IS A VERY NERDY POLICY GUY.

25
00:01:26,190 --> 00:01:29,860
NOSE TO THE GRINDSTONE FELLOW.

26
00:01:29,861 --> 00:01:32,496
WHEN THIS BECOMES PERSONNEL AND

27
00:01:32,497 --> 00:01:33,663
PEOPLE TAKE IT AWAY FROM THE

28
00:01:33,664 --> 00:01:37,501
PUBLIC VENUES OF A TOWN HALL OR

29
00:01:40,738 --> 00:01:43,340
IT SO A PERSON LIKE PAM BONDI

30
00:01:53,384 --> 00:01:55,118
THAT'S THE KIND OF THING WE SAW

31
00:01:55,119 --> 00:01:57,754
AT LUNCH COUNTERS IN THE '60s.

32
00:01:57,755 --> 00:02:00,924
I THOUGHT WE WERE NEVER GOING TO

33
00:02:00,925 --> 00:02:02,392
SEE THAT AGAIN.

34
00:02:02,393 --> 00:02:05,562
IT'S SAD.

35
00:02:05,563 --> 00:02:10,600
>> Laura: SHE DIDN'T WANT TO

36
00:02:10,601 --> 00:02:14,237
MAKE A BIG STINK, BUT DID SHE

37
00:02:14,238 --> 00:02:16,139
SAY I SHOULD HAVE STAYED.

38
00:02:16,140 --> 00:02:19,109
LIKE THE AFRICAN-AMERICAN MEN AT

39
00:02:19,110 --> 00:02:21,111
STARBUCKS, THEY DECIDED TO COME.

40
00:02:21,112 --> 00:02:24,514
GET THE POLICE AND THROW ME OUT.

41
00:02:24,515 --> 00:02:25,615
DID SHE THINK THAT?

42
00:02:25,616 --> 00:02:26,650
>> NO, I DON'T THINK SO.

43
00:02:26,651 --> 00:02:28,919
MY DAUGHTER WAS NOT RAISEED TO

44
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:30,353
BE DISRUPTIVE.

45
00:02:30,354 --> 00:02:33,123
SHE DOESN'T HAVE THIS ATTITUDE

46
00:02:33,124 --> 00:02:35,725
THAT PEOPLE OWE HER SOMETHING.

47
00:02:35,726 --> 00:02:38,261
SHE BELIEVES THAT IF THE LADY

48
00:02:40,331 --> 00:02:42,432
I THINK HER ATTITUDE WAS I COULD

49
00:02:42,433 --> 00:02:44,601
STAY AND MAKE A SCENE.

50
00:02:44,602 --> 00:02:47,404
I COULD DEMAND THAT SHE SERVE

51
00:02:47,405 --> 00:02:50,173
ME, BUT HOW DOES THAT SERVE A

52
00:02:50,174 --> 00:02:51,541
GROWING LEVEL OF CIVILITY.

53
00:02:51,542 --> 00:02:52,876
IT DOESN'T.

54
00:02:52,877 --> 00:02:55,178
THE MANAGER MADE IT CLEAR SHE

55
00:02:55,179 --> 00:02:57,514
WANTED HER TO EXIT THE

56
00:03:00,351 --> 00:03:02,219
THAT'S THE WAY SOUTHERN WOMEN DO

57
00:03:02,220 --> 00:03:02,552
THINGS.

58
00:03:12,330 --> 00:03:14,598
THERE ARE PEOPLE IN THIS COUNTRY

59
00:03:14,599 --> 00:03:16,600
WHO SEEMED TO HAVE BEEN RAISED

60
00:03:16,601 --> 00:03:17,834
BY WOLVES RATHER THAN MOTHERS

61
00:03:17,835 --> 00:03:22,105
AND FATHERS WHO TAUGHT THEM GOOD

62
00:03:22,106 --> 00:03:22,439
MANNERS.

63
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:26,877
>> Laura: SARAH HAS A SECRET

64
00:03:26,878 --> 00:03:30,514
SERVICE DETAIL NOW WITH HER.

65
00:03:30,515 --> 00:03:35,819
IS SHE GOING TO BE DIABETES --

66
00:03:35,820 --> 00:03:39,589
DINING OUT IN WASHINGTON SOON?

67
00:03:42,660 --> 00:03:44,995
>> I CAN'T CONFIRM ABOUT THE

68
00:03:44,996 --> 00:03:45,328
DETAILS.

69
00:03:45,329 --> 00:03:46,730
I SAW IT ON TWITTER TONIGHT.

70
00:03:46,731 --> 00:03:50,333
THE FIRST I HAD SEEN THAT.

71
00:03:50,334 --> 00:03:51,701
2 THINGS, I AM GLAD.

72
00:03:51,702 --> 00:03:55,705
I THINK SHE NEEDS IT IN LIGHT OF

73
00:03:55,706 --> 00:04:00,477
PETER FONDA'S COMMENTS WHEN HE

74
00:04:00,478 --> 00:04:01,978
SAID HE HOPED SOMEONE WOULD

75
00:04:01,979 --> 00:04:04,981
BREAK INTO HER HOME AND KIDNAP

76
00:04:04,982 --> 00:04:06,917
HER CHILDREN.

77
00:04:06,918 --> 00:04:09,753
FONDA OUGHT TO BE IN JAIL

78
00:04:13,991 --> 00:04:16,860
AS BEST SHE CAN.

79
00:04:16,861 --> 00:04:18,595
THIS IS GIVING REPUBLICANS AND

80
00:04:18,596 --> 00:04:20,297
DEMOCRATS A REAL MESSAGE

81
00:04:20,298 --> 00:04:20,630
CLARITY.

82
00:04:20,630 --> 00:04:22,599
THE WAY I SEE IT:

83
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:24,701
FOR REPUBLICANS EVERY DAY IS THE

84
00:04:24,702 --> 00:04:25,168
4th OF JULY.

85
00:04:25,169 --> 00:04:28,138
FOR DEMOCRATS EVERY DAY IS

86
00:04:28,139 --> 00:04:30,206
HALLOWEEN.

87
00:04:30,207 --> 00:04:33,510
AMERICA WILL GET TO DECIDE WHOSE

88
00:04:33,511 --> 00:04:35,812
MESSAGE DO THEY WANT TO FOLLOW?

89
00:04:35,813 --> 00:00:00,000
THROWING EGGS AT PEOPLE'S HOMES?
