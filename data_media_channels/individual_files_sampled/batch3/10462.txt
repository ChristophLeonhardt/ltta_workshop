social media sensations Dimond and silk say that Facebook still hasn't informed them white restricted their viral protease without explanation the networking giant stopped notifications to their millions of subscribers then later claimed that the content was quote unsafe before emitting behaving inappropriately we have communicated directly with Diamond and silk about this issue the message they received last week was inaccurate and not reflective of the way we communicates with our community and the people who run pages on our platform we have provided them with more information about our policies and the tools that are applicable to their page and look forward to the opportunity to speak with them if Facebook still hasn't removed the restrictions while dominant silk insists that they still haven't received any explanation the duo became an internet hit for their comments during the 2016 US presidential election yet it's not the first time that they've been arbitrarily blocked online with YouTube D monetizing almost all of their videos last summer and I'm pleased to say that kind of speak to the ladies in question now diamond and silk join me on the line a pleasure to speak to you ladies some great confusion here Facebook in their statements saying they have communicated to you the reasons why you seems have transgressed their regulations and as I understand though you're saying that they have them what's going on they have not communicated with us we have not talked to any representative from Facebook we have not helped to our Zuckerberg that's right I haven't received an email so that the only communication we got was the other day when they say that they deemed our content and our brand which is us diamond and silk uh-huh unsafe to the community have you got any idea whatsoever why this is happening well I have no idea well you know what maybe it's because they are afraid that we are more conservative we are black women we support our president we support his agenda so maybe they are afraid of that but they need to get unafraid unafraid and they need to make their platform where it's not discriminatory where it is an even playing field on both sides of the aisle that's right what do you think about the media coverage of the way you've been treated as this kind of helped do you think of yet a positive support from the media forcing Facebook to address the issue so far I think we've had a positive outlook on this here yeah deal is we want Facebook to fix this here we want Facebook to be fair stop silencing our voices stop being biased we had the First Amendment rights here our freedom of speech of being spiteful and that must stop initially I understand there was talk of your content being labeled as unsafe when you heard that could you make any sense of it because you could you understand what they were trying to talk about that I didn't understand it when he said that our content and our brand is unsafe to the community our brand is diamond and silk diamond asuka's to black chicks that's down with politics that's right not only that we are conservative we love our country we love our president okay so when they said that I was offended by it we was appalled by it we look at this as being censorship discrimination defamation of character and even a violation of our civil rights so Dean to black women as if we are some type of animal hoodlums or somebody just out there just hanging out unsaved us that is appalling to me Facebook was going to have the answer to that why what was the reason because we don't know that's right and we couldn't appeal it they said that we could not appeal it and this was final you see this is a worrying trend it's been a lot of talk of this year or so about you know fake news and people can talk about just about anything they like on Facebook but it gets a bit tricky when it comes to politics I mean do you see this is a worrying direction what I do because first of all Facebook is a big huge entity okay and it's an entity that people from around the world join Facebook so we don't want to get into this here Lane where you have one person dictating what people can see and what people can hear right on this platform when they service millions around the world not just in the United States but millions around the world because that's where it gets danger do not stifle our silence people's free speech that's where it's dangerous that you got to be balanced and we know that they want to say that they are a private entity but you are open to the public when you are open to the public you cannot discriminate I'm interested on how kind of bold you feel about this because obviously Facebook's a huge platform and it gives you an opportunity to air your views but if you feel that they've wronged you to what extent do you take them on would you consider ditching them going to other platforms unless they change their ways why should I they need to fix their ways that's right they put this here in place take those algorithms that you have on our pages off to thumb down our videos to keep it where our millions of followers won't be able to view our videos or we don't come up in their news face let's take that stuff off our page Facebook is gonna have to fix that why do we have to run I'm not running anywhere I'm gonna stand right here when you write you fight you challenge and that's what I'm doing and I'm not talking about fist fighting I'm talking about come to the table that's because this can be resolved but Mark Zuckerberg who is the owner our Facebook is going to have to resolve it that's right do you think this could take you in a new direction maybe you could become champions fighting censorship on the internet maybe well I don't like people voices being silenced I don't like that's dangerous that's dangerous oh no no no no we live in that type of country everybody have a right to have a point of view whether you agree with it or not and sometimes we're just going to have to agree to disagree we're gonna have to learn how to do that I've got to ask you about Donald Trump you're famous for making your comments about him how do you assess his performance as president he's doing a phenomenal job and we love Him what about all the hostility there I mean he seems from judging from the other side of the world it feels like he's been under fire since day one is he being treated fairly by the media and the public well first of all you have to stop looking at fake news that's the number one thing okay stop looking at that because fake news is the ones that treats him unfairly but the American people love him because he fights for the people looks out for the American people and by golly that's why the American people love our president is he delivering on his his promises is he trying to deliver he is delivering we got tax cuts unemployment is all the way down home ownership is up he cut regulations so if you want to become an entrepreneur you can so we are doing phenomenal in our country and we're so proud is there anything that you're unhappy with about Donald Trump as president perhaps he's done that you wouldn't have liked I love everything that he's doing what we sent him to do that's right voted for businessman because we sit him up there because we wanted him to make America great again and truly that's what he's doing making America great again can he survive though because I could said he has been under constant attack now he's his lawyer he's being questioned constant calls for impeachment do you think he can actually last the full term is going to do his eight years is what's going to have that slide so all of this other stuff you talking about I don't want to hear okay gets thrown out the window yeah the deal is that we voted for the businessman that's right six it's a million of us got out and rush march to the polls and we voted for him he's doing his job he's doing what we sent him up there to do and as we are based in Moscow I'd like to ask you about relations with with Russia something that Donald Trump was keen to see improved he said you know it would be great if Russia and America get along it feels as though he's being opposed at every turn on that do you think that it's possible for the two countries to be on friendlier terms I don't know who knows well that was shortly it was sweet it was very diplomatic more diplomatic than some of the US diplomats I must say we've been listening to you today ladies I greatly appreciate your time some fascinating opinions there diamond and silk internet commentators my guest
