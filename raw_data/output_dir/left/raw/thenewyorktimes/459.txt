1
00:00:10,844 --> 00:00:14,014
You've never heard that
somebody ask an Italian person

2
00:00:14,014 --> 00:00:16,483
or a French person or an
American person or even

3
00:00:16,483 --> 00:00:20,487
maybe a Chinese person:
"Did you get integrated?"

4
00:00:20,487 --> 00:00:24,791
It's always about the Muslims
when it's about integration.

5
00:00:24,791 --> 00:00:28,862
And the fear — There's
a lot of fear in the society

6
00:00:28,862 --> 00:00:32,031
of Muslims —Muslim
men especially—

7
00:00:32,031 --> 00:00:35,402
that they are bad for
<b>our society and that

8
00:00:35,402 --> 00:00:37,871
they are bad for
the women.

9
00:00:38,738 --> 00:00:40,974
Integration is
so big word.

10
00:00:40,974 --> 00:00:44,144
It's my life, integration,
its always my life.

11
00:00:44,144 --> 00:00:48,882
I think a lot of people, they
think this word, it's meaning

12
00:00:48,882 --> 00:00:53,486
that you become a German
man, and it's impossible.

13
00:00:54,587 --> 00:00:59,626
We like in first place to eat.
Yeah, we cook a lot.

14
00:00:59,626 --> 00:01:05,165
We made a breakfast,
Omar made his hummus.

15
00:01:05,165 --> 00:01:07,333
And I made
scrambled eggs.

16
00:01:07,333 --> 00:01:10,637
It's not just my culture 
it's also Omar's culture.

17
00:01:10,637 --> 00:01:12,572
We have learned a
lot from each other.

18
00:01:12,572 --> 00:01:16,609
Cooking of course, Omar cooks
a lot of Syrian food very often.

19
00:01:16,609 --> 00:01:20,613
And I started also to learn
to eat it, and to cook it.

20
00:01:24,017 --> 00:01:28,088
I love to learn
another language.

21
00:01:28,088 --> 00:01:32,225
I find it so interesting
to learn another language.

22
00:01:32,225 --> 00:01:36,663
I am happy right now that I
am learning Deutsch — German.

23
00:01:36,663 --> 00:01:39,599
Actually with German
right now, I have

24
00:01:39,599 --> 00:01:41,568
more communication
with people.

25
00:01:41,568 --> 00:01:43,870
Two languages, </b>
it's better than one.</b>

26
00:01:45,271 --> 00:01:48,074
When we are in the flat,
we try to speak German as much

27
00:01:48,074 --> 00:01:51,811
as possible, and sometimes
we switch into English

28
00:01:51,811 --> 00:00:00,000
because it's also the language
we got to know each other.
