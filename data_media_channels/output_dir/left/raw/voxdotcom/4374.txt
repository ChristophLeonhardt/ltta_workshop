1
00:00:01,900 --> 00:00:08,719
Frasier and Friends and Caroline in the City
and Murphy Brown and I Love Lucy all have

2
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:10,360
one thing in common.

3
00:00:12,920 --> 00:00:15,740
No, it’s not all the audience laughter.

4
00:00:15,740 --> 00:00:19,520
They all kind of look…the same.

5
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:24,420
And the shots and lighting all are kinda the
same.

6
00:00:30,939 --> 00:00:35,890
These are three camera sitcoms, with very
familiar camera angles and lighting.

7
00:00:35,890 --> 00:00:41,720
And the guy who perfected the style of light
that would one day shine upon Urkel’s face?

8
00:00:41,720 --> 00:00:43,580
“Did I do that?”

9
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:52,160
It’s Karl Freund.

10
00:00:52,170 --> 00:00:55,770
The same guy who made...this.

11
00:00:55,770 --> 00:01:01,600
He was the German cinematographer behind the
look of “Metropolis,” the 1927 classic.

12
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:07,600
And there was actually a good reason that
a genius decided that going from this

13
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:12,000
to this was a challenge worth betting his
career on.

14
00:01:19,980 --> 00:01:22,659
This right here is cinematic history.

15
00:01:22,660 --> 00:01:25,200
It’s from 1924’s “The Last Laugh.”

16
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:31,360
For this movie, Karl Freund invented what
was probably the first dolly shot in history

17
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:34,680
- that’s when a camera moves on a cart or
a track.

18
00:01:37,190 --> 00:01:43,000
When Freund moved from Germany to Hollywood,
he continued to make visual masterpieces from

19
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:48,020
directing the original “The Mummy,” to
being the cinematographer on “Dracula.”

20
00:01:48,020 --> 00:01:53,640
This scene from Dracula is emblematic of his
work, with shadows and light serving as powerful

21
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:55,409
tools in the scene.

22
00:01:55,409 --> 00:02:00,440
With 1937’s “The Good Earth,” he won
an Academy Award for Cinematography.

23
00:02:00,440 --> 00:02:06,060
Freund’s art came from powerful imagery
and stark contrasts, like in this scene from

24
00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:06,800
Metropolis.

25
00:02:10,900 --> 00:02:13,659
I Love Lucy looked good - but pretty flat.

26
00:02:14,740 --> 00:02:18,660
That’s why it’s so surprising that he
thought it could be a breakthrough.

27
00:02:20,580 --> 00:02:26,120
We know Freund was nervous about making a
transition from movies like this to television

28
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:27,820
filmed in front of a live audience.

29
00:02:28,290 --> 00:02:33,480
Traditional movie lighting wouldn't work in
that environment and on a tight TV schedule.

30
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:34,100
Here's why.

31
00:02:35,109 --> 00:02:36,419
Dramatic lighting is cool.

32
00:02:36,420 --> 00:02:42,060
But if I move, the way people move in sitcoms,
I lose the light and the shot.

33
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:46,580
You also can't reset and move that light in front
of a live audience.

34
00:02:46,590 --> 00:02:52,780
The shot also has to be lit so that it can be shown
by three different cameras at the same time.

35
00:02:52,780 --> 00:02:58,769
That challenge appealed to Freund, and, laugh
track jokes aside, he wrote that a live studio

36
00:02:58,769 --> 00:03:03,380
audience had “an astonishing effect in stimulating
performers.”

37
00:03:05,049 --> 00:03:09,879
There were earlier experiments with live taping,
but Freund perfected it.

38
00:03:09,879 --> 00:03:15,430
You can see how he did it in I Love Lucy’s
very first episodes and in this on set picture.

39
00:03:15,430 --> 00:03:21,010
First, he put three cameras on his trademark
dollies - which is why these are called three

40
00:03:21,010 --> 00:03:22,290
camera sitcoms.

41
00:03:22,290 --> 00:03:28,159
Usually it has one camera in the middle, for
wide shots, and two on the sides for closeups.

42
00:03:28,159 --> 00:03:33,449
You can see it here, as well as in the tape
he used to mark the cameras’ positions.

43
00:03:33,449 --> 00:03:38,540
This is how it worked — letting cameras
move on the fly, without relighting.

44
00:03:38,540 --> 00:03:44,109
Cameramen coordinated at all times using headsets
and they were connected to the control room.

45
00:03:44,109 --> 00:03:49,709
To light this set up, Freund used an overhead
grid of lights like these and even put floor

46
00:03:49,709 --> 00:03:54,799
lights on the bottom of each camera to flatter
actors’ faces.

47
00:03:54,799 --> 00:03:55,980
This?

48
00:03:55,980 --> 00:03:57,740
This is not like I Love Lucy.

49
00:04:01,140 --> 00:04:05,120
He also placed microphones around the set
so they wouldn’t get in the way.

50
00:04:05,129 --> 00:04:09,780
Lucy and Ethel could bounce around the living
room without needing to stop taping — or

51
00:04:09,780 --> 00:04:11,340
stop the laughter.

52
00:04:11,340 --> 00:04:16,959
All of this let them keep a strict shooting
schedule with minimum reshoots after the show.

53
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:21,879
For Freund, all this visual work was in service
of making one sound possible.

54
00:04:27,420 --> 00:04:30,520
This is still kind of how it’s done today.

55
00:04:30,530 --> 00:04:34,680
Freund’s tricks established a template for
the three camera sitcom that’s still in

56
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:39,889
use today. As you can see it in “Vox”
- the first workplace sitcom where people

57
00:04:39,889 --> 00:04:40,920
actually work.

58
00:05:00,860 --> 00:05:05,379
Anyway, as you can see, there’s no need
to relight Dean as he crosses the room in

59
00:05:05,379 --> 00:05:08,889
this scene, only to be ignored by Ashley, because she's too busy working.

60
00:05:08,889 --> 00:05:13,949
Freund’s techniques did have drawbacks,
some of those drawbacks are visible in today’s

61
00:05:13,949 --> 00:05:18,740
sitcoms, and some are specific to the time
in which he worked.

62
00:05:18,740 --> 00:05:22,710
He had to put darker makeup on his actors
so they wouldn’t be blown out by the lights

63
00:05:22,710 --> 00:05:25,560
- and you can see it on Lucy and Ethel here.

64
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:30,310
In this scene, they were probably wearing
pastel clothing as well, because nothing could

65
00:05:30,310 --> 00:05:35,169
be too bright — film processing gave everything
higher contrast than normal.

66
00:05:35,169 --> 00:05:39,650
Even today the three camera sitcom has
a less adventurous look — as you can see

67
00:05:39,650 --> 00:05:43,710
as AJ and Ashley go through all their unread emails.

68
00:05:43,710 --> 00:05:49,310
It affects focus, too - look at the Big Bang
Theory next to its prequel, Young Sheldon.

69
00:05:49,310 --> 00:05:54,240
Big Bang Theory, the 3 camera sitcom, looks
pretty much like I Love Lucy.

70
00:05:54,240 --> 00:06:00,560
There are very few, or faint shadows, everything’s
in focus, and the camera angles are familiar.

71
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:06,409
Young Sheldon is single camera, like a movie,
and that allows it to have light and shadow

72
00:06:06,409 --> 00:06:08,550
and a gorgeous blurred background.

73
00:06:08,550 --> 00:06:15,319
But Freund’s innovation did help a live
audience — and us — see Friends, and Seinfeld,

74
00:06:15,319 --> 00:06:16,319
and Frasier.

75
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:22,090
As he wrote in 1953: “To have had the opportunity
to play a part in the success of the I Love

76
00:06:22,090 --> 00:06:27,740
Lucy show, which is now the No. 1 rated Television
show in the nation assures me the efforts

77
00:06:27,740 --> 00:06:31,419
to overcome the handicaps have not been in
vain.”

78
00:06:31,419 --> 00:06:33,629
Karl Freund was a genius.

79
00:06:33,629 --> 00:00:00,000
And sometimes even genius has a sense of humor.
