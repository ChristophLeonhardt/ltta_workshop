00:00:11,144 --> 00:00:13,947
ONE OF THE NETWORKS AND I SEE,

3
00:00:13,947 --> 00:00:16,416
DONALD TRUMP WHO IS NOT VERY

4
00:00:16,416 --> 00:00:16,750
POPULAR.

5
00:00:16,750 --> 00:00:18,385
I SAY, WHAT ARE YOU TALKING

6
00:00:18,385 --> 00:00:18,685
ABOUT?

7
00:00:18,685 --> 00:00:21,054
YOU SAW THE POLL COME OUT THAT

8
00:00:21,054 --> 00:00:21,822
I'M ABOVE OBAMA.

9
00:00:21,822 --> 00:00:23,657
BUT THEN YOU TURN TO FAKE NEWS

10
00:00:23,657 --> 00:00:25,926
AND THEY GO, DONALD TRUMP WHO IS

11
00:00:25,926 --> 00:00:27,394
NOT VERY POPULAR.

12
00:00:27,394 --> 00:00:30,230
I'M SAYING TO MYSELF, HOW DO

13
00:00:30,230 --> 00:00:33,066
THEY GET AWAY WITH IT.

14
00:00:33,066 --> 00:00:36,770
>> RASMUSSEN ONE OF THE MOST

15
00:00:36,770 --> 00:00:37,871
ACCURATE POLLS FOR THE ELECTION

16
00:00:37,871 --> 00:00:40,340
AND YOU'RE IN THAT CATEGORY AND

17
00:00:40,340 --> 00:00:42,676
YOU GET PUBLICITY.

18
00:00:42,676 --> 00:00:44,244
>> INDICTMENT OF THE MEDIA HAS

19
00:00:44,244 --> 00:00:46,213
BEEN CENTRAL TO BOTH PRESIDENT

20
00:00:46,213 --> 00:00:47,748
TRUMP'S CANDIDACY AND

21
00:00:47,748 --> 00:00:48,181
PRESIDENCY.

22
00:00:48,181 --> 00:00:50,317
LET'S BRING IN DIAMOND AND SILK,

23
00:00:50,317 --> 00:00:51,685
SOCIAL MEDIA STARS AND TRUMP

24
00:00:51,685 --> 00:00:52,085
SUPPORTERS.

25
00:00:52,085 --> 00:00:52,519
GOOD MORNING.

26
00:00:52,519 --> 00:00:53,654
THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR BEING

27
00:00:53,654 --> 00:00:53,954
HERE.

28
00:00:53,954 --> 00:00:55,355
THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN ALSO RELEASED

29
00:00:55,355 --> 00:00:58,058
WHAT THEY'RE CALLING AN

30
00:00:58,058 --> 00:00:59,026
ACCOUNTABILITY SURVEY ASKING

31
00:00:59,026 --> 00:00:59,926
PEOPLE THESE QUESTIONS.

32
00:00:59,926 --> 00:01:01,628
WE'LL PUT THEM ON THE SCREEN.

33
00:01:01,628 --> 00:01:04,096
THEY SAY, DO YOU TRUST THE

34
00:01:04,096 --> 00:01:05,565
SO-CALLED MAIN STREEN MEDIA.

35
00:01:05,565 --> 00:01:07,067
WHICH ISSUES DO THEY DO THE

36
00:01:07,067 --> 00:01:07,934
WORST JOB OF REPORTING ON

37
00:01:07,934 --> 00:01:09,069
PRESIDENT TRUMP.

38
00:01:09,069 --> 00:01:13,640
DO YOU FEEL THEY'RE TOO EAGER TO

39
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:14,207
SLUR CONSERVATIVES.

40
00:01:14,207 --> 00:01:16,243
I WOULD PRESUME YOU AGREE WITH A

41
00:01:16,243 --> 00:01:17,244
LOT OF THOSE.

42
00:01:17,244 --> 00:01:19,546
BUT THIS SURVEY AND ARGUMENT, IS

43
00:01:19,546 --> 00:01:20,647
IT RESONATING WITH THE AMERICAN

44
00:01:20,647 --> 00:01:20,981
PEOPLE?

45
00:01:20,981 --> 00:01:21,615
>> I THINK IT IS.

46
00:01:21,615 --> 00:01:21,948
>> YEAH.

47
00:01:21,948 --> 00:01:24,051
>> I THINK PEOPLE ARE TIRED OF

48
00:01:24,051 --> 00:01:27,187
THE FAKE NEWS, THE LEFT WING

49
00:01:27,187 --> 00:01:30,891
MEDIA SPREAD LIES, R AND

50
00:01:30,891 --> 00:01:30,924
MEDIA SPREAD LIES, A AND

51
00:01:30,924 --> 00:01:31,224
MEDIA SPREAD LIES, ANDND

52
00:01:31,224 --> 00:01:31,658
MEDIA SPREAD LIES, AND WANTING

53
00:01:31,658 --> 00:01:33,827
YOU TO GO ON WITH THE NARRATIVE.

54
00:01:33,827 --> 00:01:35,028
THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO BE FREE

55
00:01:35,028 --> 00:01:37,230
PRESS BUT THEY'RE TRYING TO BE A

56
00:01:37,230 --> 00:01:39,032
CONTROL PRESS WHERE THEY CONTROL

57
00:01:39,032 --> 00:01:40,867
THE MASSES OF PEOPLE WITH THEIR

58
00:01:40,867 --> 00:01:42,669
FAKE NEWS NARRATIVE AND IT'S GOT

59
00:01:42,669 --> 00:01:43,136
TO STOP.

60
00:01:43,136 --> 00:01:45,739
I'M SO HAPPY THAT THE TRUMP

61
00:01:45,739 --> 00:01:48,642
CAMPAIGN IS BRINGING AWARENESS

62
00:01:48,642 --> 00:01:49,142
TO THIS ISSUE.

63
00:01:49,142 --> 00:01:49,743
>> THAT'S RIGHT.

64
00:01:49,743 --> 00:01:51,244
>> MAYBE CONGRESS SHOULD CALL

65
00:01:51,244 --> 00:01:52,612
THEM UP TO THE HILL TO SEE

66
00:01:52,612 --> 00:01:53,747
WHAT'S GOING ON WITH THE MEDIA

67
00:01:53,747 --> 00:01:55,582
AND WHY DO THEY KEEP SMEARING

68
00:01:55,582 --> 00:01:56,416
PEOPLE LIKE THEY DO.

69
00:01:56,416 --> 00:01:57,651
>> ABSOLUTELY.

70
00:01:57,651 --> 00:01:57,951
NO.

71
00:01:57,951 --> 00:01:59,686
IT'S A REAL PROBLEM AND

72
00:01:59,686 --> 00:02:01,221
SOMETHING THAT'S BEEN ADDRESSED

73
00:02:01,221 --> 00:02:02,456
TIME AND TIME AGAIN BY THE

74
00:02:02,456 --> 00:02:02,823
CAMPAIGN.

75
00:02:02,823 --> 00:02:04,391
>> THERE IS A NEW REPORT OUT

76
00:02:04,391 --> 00:02:06,693
TALKING ABOUT THE WHITE HOUSE

77
00:02:06,693 --> 00:02:07,794
CORRESPONDENT'S ASSOCIATION,

78
00:02:07,794 --> 00:02:09,596
SAYING IT HAS BEEN EXPOSED THAT

79
00:02:09,596 --> 00:02:12,833
IT REGULARLY SPENDS 85% OF THEIR

80
00:02:12,833 --> 00:02:16,436
REVENUE ON ANNUAL PARTY, NOT ON

81
00:02:16,436 --> 00:02:19,473
SCHOLARSHIPS, WHAT IT'S MAINLY

82
00:02:19,473 --> 00:02:20,173
BEEN KNOWN FOR.

83
00:02:20,173 --> 00:02:21,675
ARE YOU SURPRISED BY THIS?

84
00:02:21,675 --> 00:02:24,377
>> THAT'S VERY SURPRISING.

85
00:02:24,377 --> 00:02:25,378
THEY ALWAYS POINT THE FINGER ON

86
00:02:25,378 --> 00:02:26,413
THE OTHER SIDE.

87
00:02:26,413 --> 00:02:28,315
BUT LOOK AT THEM.

88
00:02:28,315 --> 00:02:31,218
IT SCOLD

89
00:02:31,218 --> 00:02:31,251
IT CCOLD

90
00:02:31,251 --> 00:02:32,886
IT COULD BE A SLUSH FUND.

91
00:02:32,886 --> 00:02:35,355
YOU'RE GOING TO TAKE 85% ON A

92
00:02:35,355 --> 00:02:37,190
MEAL AND TO BASH SOMEBODY AND

93
00:02:37,190 --> 00:02:38,625
ONLY 15% ON WHAT IT'S SUPPOSED

94
00:02:38,625 --> 00:02:39,559
TO BE USED FOR.

95
00:02:39,559 --> 00:02:40,527
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

96
00:02:40,527 --> 00:02:41,027
>> THAT'S RIGHT.

97
00:02:41,027 --> 00:02:42,729
>> AND IT LOOKS LIKE SOMEBODY

98
00:02:42,729 --> 00:02:44,131
SHOULD CALL THEM OUT OR GET RID

99
00:02:44,131 --> 00:02:44,998
OF IT ALL TOGETHER.

100
00:02:44,998 --> 00:02:47,567
>> SOUNDS LIKE IT'S BEEN

101
00:02:47,567 --> 00:02:48,468
EXPOSED, ED, AT THIS POINT.

102
00:02:48,468 --> 00:02:50,804
>> I USED TO BE PRESIDENT OF THE

103
00:02:50,804 --> 00:02:51,505
CORRESPONDENT'S ASSOCIATION.

104
00:02:51,505 --> 00:02:53,240
I RAN THE DINNER ONE YEAR.

105
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:55,942
SO I TAKE ISSUE WITH YOU SAYING

106
00:02:55,942 --> 00:02:56,743
IT'S SLUSH FUND.

107
00:02:56,743 --> 00:02:57,978
SIT NOT A SLUSH FUND.

108
00:02:57,978 --> 00:02:59,646
I WAS THERE, I SAW

109
00:02:59,646 --> 00:03:00,447
ACCOUNTABILITY FOR IT.

110
00:03:00,447 --> 00:03:02,215
BUT I AGREE THAT A LOT MORE

111
00:03:02,215 --> 00:03:04,284
MONEY SHOULD GO TO SCHOLARSHIPS.

112
00:03:04,284 --> 00:03:05,452
I'M ON RECORD SAYING THAT.

113
00:03:05,452 --> 00:03:07,954
I WAS PRESIDENT AROUND 2012,

114
00:03:07,954 --> 00:03:08,255
2013.

115
00:03:08,255 --> 00:03:09,856
AND I THINK TOO MUCH IS SPENT ON

116
00:03:09,856 --> 00:03:11,324
THAT DINNER TO YOUR POINT AND

117
00:03:11,324 --> 00:03:13,260
NOT ENOUGH ON THE MONEY THAT WE

118
00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:15,462
SAY WE'RE GIVING TO THE NEXT

119
00:03:15,462 --> 00:03:16,563
GENERATION OF JOURNALISTS.

120
00:03:16,563 --> 00:03:17,731
IT'S NOT A SLUSH FUND.

121
00:03:17,731 --> 00:03:19,633
PEOPLE ARE NOT MISUSING THE

122
00:03:19,633 --> 00:03:19,933
MONEY.

123
00:03:19,933 --> 00:03:21,601
BUT I WAY AGREE WITH YOU THAT IT

124
00:03:21,601 --> 00:03:25,005
SHOULD BE ABOUT THE NEXT

125
00:03:25,005 --> 00:03:25,806
GENERATION.

126
00:03:25,806 --> 00:03:26,973
>> ABSOLUTELY.

127
00:03:26,973 --> 00:03:28,441
THAT'S MY PERSONAL OPINION.

128
00:03:28,441 --> 00:03:29,442
IT SOUNDS LIKE TO ME.

129
00:03:29,442 --> 00:03:29,843
>> YEAH.

130
00:03:29,843 --> 00:03:31,745
>> BUT YOU KNOW WHAT?

131
00:03:31,745 --> 00:03:33,413
IF YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE AN

132
00:03:33,413 --> 00:03:34,381
ORGANIZATION THAT'S SUPPOSED TO

133
00:03:34,381 --> 00:03:35,715
HELP PEOPLE WITH SCHOLARSHIPS,

134
00:03:35,715 --> 00:03:36,750
THEN USE THE MONEY FOR THAT.

135
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:38,952
BUT YOU'RE GOING TO TAKE 85% OF

136
00:03:38,952 --> 00:03:41,555
IT AND USE IT FOR SOMEONE TO EAT

137
00:03:41,555 --> 00:03:42,722
AND BASH SOMEONE?

138
00:03:42,722 --> 00:03:44,257
THAT'S APPALLING TO ME.

139
00:03:44,257 --> 00:03:45,659
>> WELL YOUR POINT IS THAT IT

140
00:03:45,659 --> 00:03:47,093
FEELS LIKE THE SWAMP.

141
00:03:47,093 --> 00:03:49,362
WE TELL YOU WE'RE ALL ABOUT THE

142
00:03:49,362 --> 00:03:50,297
SCHOLARSHIPS, ALL ABOUT THE

143
00:03:50,297 --> 00:03:50,597
KIDS.

144
00:03:50,597 --> 00:03:51,832
ALWAYS ABOUT THE KIDS.

145
00:03:51,832 --> 00:03:55,202
BUT 85% OF IT IS ASHT OUR

146
00:03:55,202 --> 00:03:55,235
BUT 85% OF IT IS ABOT OUR

147
00:03:55,235 --> 00:03:55,335
BUT 85% OF IT IS ABOUTOUR

148
00:03:55,335 --> 00:03:55,368
BUT 85% OF IT IS ABOUT OR

149
00:03:55,368 --> 00:03:56,169
BUT 85% OF IT IS ABOUT OUR

150
00:03:56,169 --> 00:03:58,405
TUXES, SPEECHES AND THE FANCY

151
00:03:58,405 --> 00:03:59,573
DRINKS THAT'S THE SWAMP FOR YOU.

152
00:03:59,573 --> 00:04:06,012
>> I'M NOT DIETING ED. INDICTING

153
00:04:06,012 --> 00:04:06,046
>> I'M NOT DIETING ED. INDICTINE

154
00:04:06,046 --> 00:04:06,680
>> I'M NOT DIETING ED. INDICTIN.

155
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:08,415
ROSIE O'DONNELL, TURNS OUT SHE

156
00:04:08,415 --> 00:04:12,552
LOVES DEMOCRATS SO MUCH THAT SHE

157
00:04:12,552 --> 00:04:15,055
GAVE TOO MUCH, WENT OVER THE

158
00:04:15,055 --> 00:04:16,890
DONATION LIMIT TO MULTIPLE

159
00:04:16,890 --> 00:04:17,390
DEMOCRATS.

160
00:04:17,390 --> 00:04:18,858
OVER THE LEGAL LIMIT.

161
00:04:18,858 --> 00:04:20,360
DOESN'T SURPRISE YOU THAT

162
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:22,896
ROSIE'S GIVING WOULD BE SO

163
00:04:22,896 --> 00:04:23,363
OVERLY GENEROUS.

164
00:04:23,363 --> 00:04:24,764
>> WHAT SURPRISED ME IS NOBODY

165
00:04:24,764 --> 00:04:27,100
HAS CALLED HER OUT, LIKE THE

166
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:27,467
DEMOCRATS.

167
00:04:27,467 --> 00:04:29,903
WHERE IS SHEILA JACKSON?

168
00:04:29,903 --> 00:04:33,740
WHERE IS HAKEEM JEFFRIES.

169
00:04:33,740 --> 00:04:38,378
WHERE IS THE FCC TO CALL HER OUT

170
00:04:38,378 --> 00:04:39,546
ABOUT OVERLY GIVING OF THE

171
00:04:39,546 --> 00:04:39,846
MONEY.

172
00:04:39,846 --> 00:04:40,347
>> THAT'S RIGHT.

173
00:04:40,347 --> 00:04:42,983
>> I FIND THE HYPOCRISY SO REAL

174
00:04:42,983 --> 00:04:44,784
AND SO UNBALANCED HERE.

175
00:04:44,784 --> 00:04:47,287
IF YOU'RE GOING TO ALWAYS HOLD A

176
00:04:47,287 --> 00:04:48,288
REPUBLICAN ACCOUNTABLE, YOU'RE

177
00:04:48,288 --> 00:04:50,790
GOING TO HAVE TO HOLD DEMOCRATS

178
00:04:50,790 --> 00:04:51,291
ACCOUNTABLE TOO.

179
00:04:51,291 --> 00:04:53,193
>> SHE USED FIVE DIFFERENT NEW

180
00:04:53,193 --> 00:04:55,528
YORK ADDRESSES, FOUR DIFFERENT

181
00:04:55,528 --> 00:04:57,163
VARIATIONS OF HER NAME.

182
00:04:57,163 --> 00:04:59,332
TO HER POINT, HOW DID THIS GO

183
00:04:59,332 --> 00:05:00,400
MISSING FOR SO LONG.

184
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:02,369
I DON'T CARE WHO YOU SUPPORT,

185
00:05:02,369 --> 00:05:03,937
THESE ARE THINGS THAT WE SHOULD

186
00:05:03,937 --> 00:05:04,337
KNOW ABOUT.

187
00:05:04,337 --> 00:05:06,439
DIAMOND AND SILK, ALWAYS GOOD TO

188
00:05:06,439 --> 00:05:06,806
HAVE YOU.
