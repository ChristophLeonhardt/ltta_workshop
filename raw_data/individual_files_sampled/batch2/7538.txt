now there's a couple different ways that Donald Trump could end his term one is it goes the whole four years and then he loses reelection of course I can go eight years and and then he would step down eight years four that's it good he's not gonna make it so if he's not gonna make it there are only two paths for him to leave impeachment and resignation wait there's actually a third so impeachment is the one that is most often talked about resignation could come for a number of reasons mainly because you're worried they're gonna impeach you but the third pass is a 25th amendment if you are mentally incompetent to carry on the duties of the office the vice-president combined with majorities in Congress can have your removed now some scholars say that it is a very very high standard meaning you know pretty much have to be in a coma others say no that's not the case at all we would just have to be absolutely sure that he is literally mentally incompetent to hold office not meaning that we think he's dumb that's a fairly easy case to make at this point I believe and probably could get a huge percentage of the country to agree with you but that he has some sort of issue which then leads us to speculation about this started a couple months ago by one of the top allies for the president Roger stone he said this before anyone else did listen they are going to claim that Donald Trump has Alzheimer's and that it is progressive and that is progressing and that is the source of his insanity but under the 25th amendment if a majority of the cabinet plus of the vice-president agree that the president is incapacitated well then he is removed and if he seeks to fight the charges it goes to the US House of Representatives where erosion among Republicans could destroy the trump presidency but this is the game plan watch carefully you're gonna see the word balls Ivers more and more in the next several days I believe that was Roger still in trying to plant a thought in people's heads it didn't stink almost no one talked about Alzheimer's at that time or a couple of days later but it is very interesting that it's his Trump sign that's putting that out there look I think you're very solid theory as to how Trump resigns is they said oh well he had a checkup and it turns out poor guys at early-stage Alzheimer's he's gonna have to step down now is he gonna do that because he's tired or that he's realizes opponents are correct that he doesn't have the mental capacity for leadership of course not no they would do that as the beginning of a defense for the charges against them on the Russian collusion I some of trumps lawyers have represented mob characters who claimed insanity that is the beginning of an insanity plea oh please please go in that direction for the good of the country for the good of the world one you'd resign from office to we get to say we told you it was crazy and three it's not a difference that's gonna work but it gives you a sense of how desperate they are it's his hide that starts it but it then starts to snowball in a hot mic moment two senators were caught talking about Donald Trump they said a lot of disparaging things but they also touched on this issue one was a Democrat Jack Reed the other one was a Republican Susan Collins listen to this I don't say that lightly and it's a kind of well look there's a Republican senator is saying he might be crazy so it has begun now we go to bob corker another republican senator a very respected one a very right-wing one from the south and nonetheless he said this president has not yet has not yet been able to demonstrate the stability nor some of the competence that he needs to demonstrate in order to be successful damn that is a guy who in the past is not really criticized Trump there's some Republicans who have he was not in that group for a guy that deeply right-wing to come out and say our president a head of the Republican Party might not have the stability or the mental competence to be president that should not be understated as that's a huge news event that happened on Friday so this is picking up steam Jackie Speier back on the Democratic side tweeted out POTUS is showing signs of erratic behavior and mental instability that placed the country in grave danger time to invoke - 25th amendment that's a US Congress person saying that when Adam Schiff was asked about it now he's a person who's higher up in Democratic leadership in the house he said you know I don't think we're at a point of thinking about the 25th amendment saying in the longer version of that interview I can see why people are concerned I can see why they're going in that direction but basically saying not yet which doesn't mean no that's outrageous no we wouldn't think about it just not quite yet and by the way Democrats for all that they're supposed to oppose Trump often are far more timid and opposing him than Republicans who are not on Trump's side whether it's bob corker Suzanne Collins or people like Jennifer Rubin very very conservative writer for The Washington Post when asked in a podcast if Trump is racist she said absolutely he basically sees the world in very simplistic terms and he categorizes people based on race and other factors along those lines which you shouldn't make decisions based on so when the time comes and Trump needs Republicans it appears that a lot of them are not going to be there for him and we're just at the beginning of this process now speaking of timid the mainstream media is incredibly timid when it comes to these type of topics nonetheless brian Stelter in a slightly awkward way brought up this issue over the weekend on CNN's reliable sources let's watch is the President of the United States a racist is he suffering from some kind of illness is he fit for office and if he's unfit then what these are upsetting polarizing questions that they're uncomfortable to ask but we in the national news media can't pretend like our readers and viewers aren't already absent they are asking is the President of the United States suffering from some sort of illness is he racist is he fit to be commander in chief and one more is it time for objective journalist and I don't mean opinion folks I mean down the middle journalists to address these questions head-on if so how in the world should they do that uh that's actually super simple I like to overly dramatic reading of that but but you just talk about them I know why CNN is very very light and do that because they don't want to be called the liberal media bob Corker is talking about it it's okay and by the way they wouldn't have brought enough if people like bob Corker what didn't give them permission to bring it up in a sense so is the president racist look we talked about that before he he clearly is I mean saying that he thinks the people who were protesting Nazis were just as culpable and in saying that many sides both sides do it he called him he called a counter protesters of Nazis very very violent he said there was very fine people on the Nazi side Jesus Christ anyway is he ill does he actually have Alzheimer's I have no idea I'm not his doctor and by the way these doctor doesn't know Trump rights though his own notes for the doctor the doctor pretty much admitted that goofball as he is is he unfit for office tips trade he is that's not a hard conversation at all now having said that that doesn't mean you could use the 25th amendment I'm gonna give you my thoughts on that in one second but I want to get your thoughts we're doing a poll TOI tea network.com slash 25th and the question is should Trump be disqualified from presidents feet for mental incompetence I mean it's a funny way of putting it but that's pretty much literally where the 24th amendment would do now again you need pence and you need majority of Congress it's not an easy thing to do do I think they should do it no look the guy's horribly incompetent I told you from day one and earlier than day one that his number one problem would not be the racism or his policies it would be his grotesque incompetence why do you think I did a segment called loser Donald where I found you a hundred examples of his incompetence before the election because I knew that that's his number one problem but we knew that before we voted so I don't think you should be able to replace a president just because he's monumentally dumb or you think he's monumentally offensive so if there is a crime and and Muller finds evidence of it warm up that impeachment machine I'll be the first person in that parade I think Trump is gonna resign and disgrace anyway you know he might even use this Alzheimer's defense that his buddy Roger stone has set up for him but in terms of pushing out a president because we don't like him that's an undemocratic principle that I'm not in favor of even with a monster like Donald Trump even though he's clearly incompetent in every way shape or form but the guy's not in a coma and we have no idea if he actually has an illness so I vote no but that's how bad it's gotten that we're having that conversation TYT membership gets your commercial-free young turks downloaded streaming podcasts that get all the network shows and support independent media TYT Network comm /join
