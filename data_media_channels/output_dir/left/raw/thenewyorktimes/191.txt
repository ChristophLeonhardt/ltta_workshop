1
00:00:00,988 --> 00:00:04,288
Homing pigeons, 
like people, have leaders,

2
00:00:04,288 --> 00:00:07,814
and those leaders are 
sometimes wrong.

3
00:00:09,644 --> 00:00:13,112
When that happens,
what do pigeons do?

4
00:00:14,519 --> 00:00:16,036
To answer that question,

5
00:00:16,036 --> 00:00:18,299
researchers outfitted
some pigeons

6
00:00:18,299 --> 00:00:21,157
with GPS backpacks 
like these.

7
00:00:22,319 --> 00:00:25,004
The devices recorded the
lines of flight.

8
00:00:25,004 --> 00:00:27,777
An analysis of all
that information

9
00:00:27,777 --> 00:00:33,028
showed which pigeons
were the leaders.

10
00:00:33,028 --> 00:00:35,127
For the experiment,
the researchers took

11
00:00:35,127 --> 00:00:38,058
the leaders and used
artificial lighting to shift

12
00:00:38,058 --> 00:00:40,004
their internal clocks.

13
00:00:40,004 --> 00:00:42,232
Pigeons use the sun
to navigate,

14
00:00:42,232 --> 00:00:45,542
so that messed up their
sense of direction.

15
00:00:45,542 --> 00:00:48,167
When they were released,
the leaders were confused

16
00:00:48,167 --> 00:00:50,742
and led their flocks astray.

17
00:00:53,642 --> 00:00:56,781
But either the leaders
realized they were wrong,

18
00:00:56,781 --> 00:00:58,097
and fell back in the flock,

19
00:00:58,097 --> 00:01:01,018
giving someone else a
chance to lead,

20
00:01:01,018 --> 00:01:03,824
or the flock 
collectively said:

21
00:01:03,824 --> 00:01:08,251
“Wait a minute.
This isn’t right.”

22
00:01:08,251 --> 00:01:10,206
Either way,
the pigeons figured out

23
00:01:10,206 --> 00:01:13,075
what the correct 
direction was.

24
00:01:13,075 --> 00:01:15,115
Sadly, these are pigeons,

25
00:01:15,115 --> 00:00:00,000
and this has nothing to do
with politics.
