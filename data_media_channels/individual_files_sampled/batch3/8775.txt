PRIVILEGE, I'M GOING TO CALL ON SENATOR FLAKE TO SPEAK. NORMALLY WE WOULD START THE VOTE RIGHT NOW BUT AS A POINT OF PERSONAL PRIVILEGE I WOULD CALL ON SENATOR FLAKE. THANK YOU. I HAVE BEEN SPEAKING WITH A NUMBER OF PEOPLE ON THE OTHER SIDE, WE HAVE HAD CONVERSATIONS ON GOING FOR A WHILE WITH REGARD TO MAKING SURE THAT WE DO DUE DILIGENCE HERE. AND I THINK IT WOULD BE PROPER TO DELAY THE FLOOR VOTE. FOR UP TO, BUT NOT MORE THAN ONE WEEK. IN ORDER TO LET THE FBI CONTINUE TO DO AN INVESTIGATION, LIMITED IN TIME AND SCOPE, THE CURRENT ALLEGATIONS THAT ARE THERE, LIMITED IN TIME TO MORE THAN ONE WEEK. I WILL VOTE TO ADVANCE THE BILL TO THE FLOOR WITH THAT UNDERSTANDING AND I'VE SPOKEN TO A FEW OTHER MEMBERS WHO ON MY SIDE OF THE AISLE MAY BE SUPPORTIVE AS WELL. THAT'S MY POSITION. I THINK THAT DOING DUE DILIGENCE IS IMPORTANT AND I WANT TO SAY THAT THIS COMMITTEE HAS ACTED PROPERLY. THE CHAIRMAN HAS BENT OVER BACKWARDS TO DO INVESTIGATIONS FROM THIS COMMITTEE. AND TO DELAY THIS VOTE IN THIS COMMITTEE FOR A WEEK SO THAT DR. FORD CAN BE HEARD. AND SHE WAS YESTERDAY. SO THAT'S WITHOUT AGREEMENT. I WILL VOTE TO ADVANCE THE BILL TO THE FLOOR. ONE SECOND, CAN DIANE SPEAK? WHAT ARE WE VOTING ON? WE ARE VOTING ON THE MOTION TO REPORT THE NOMINATION TO THE FLOOR. THAT'S NOT MY UNDERSTANDING, LET THE SENATOR EXPLAIN IT. MY UNDERSTANDING, THE DEMOCRATS COULD SPEAK TO IT, CHRIS OR YOU AS WE TALKED ABOUT BEFORE. THE DEMOCRATS WOULD ACCEPT AND ENDORSE ALL ONE WEEK FBI INVESTIGATION LIMITED IN TIME AND SCOPE. SINCE YOU ARE THE DECIDING VOTE HERE, WE WILL VOTE AND IF THERE'S ANY SORT OF DISCUSSION WE WILL DO THAT AFTER THE VOTE. CALL THE ROLE. MR KENNEDY, MR FLAKE, MR. DURBIN, . ON THE NOMINEE, NO. NO. MR. BOOKER? NO. MS. HARRIS? NO. MR. CHAIRMAN, THE VOTES ARE 11 NAY, 10 YEA. I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR GIVING US THE TIME TODAY TO HAVE IT IN A CONVERSATION. A NUMBER OF MY COLLEAGUES HAVE ASKED FOR A ONE WEEK DELAY IN ORDER THAT THERE MIGHT BE AN FBI INVESTIGATION OF WHAT ALLEGATIONS ARE CURRENTLY BEFORE THIS COMMITTEE. I RESPECT SENATOR FLAKE'S VIEW THAT IN HIS OPINION IT WAS BEST TO RESPECT YOUR HAVING GIVEN DR. FORD THE TIME TO BE HEARD YESTERDAY AND ADVANCE THE NOMINEE TO THE FLOOR. BUT IT IS MY HOPE THAT WE COULD WORK TOGETHER ON A BIPARTISAN BASIS TO DILIGENTLY PURSUE AN FBI INVESTIGATION WITHIN THE NEXT WEEK. NOT FOR THE PURPOSE OF DELAY BUT FOR THE PURPOSE OF INVESTIGATING FURTHER EITHER ALLEGATIONS MADE BY DR. FORD OR OTHERS WITH A GOAL TOWARDS DEMONSTRATING A BIPARTISAN COMMITMENT TO DILIGENTLY INVESTIGATE THESE ALLEGATIONS. THANK YOU, MR. CHAIRMAN. THANK YOU, SENATOR FLAKE. I WOULD SUPPORT THAT MOTION. I THINK WE DO NEED THIS INVESTIGATION. I SORT OF MISUNDERSTOOD SENATOR FLAKE WHAT YOU ARE DOING, I THOUGHT IT INCLUDED A ONE-WEEK INVESTIGATION. SO I WOULD LIKE TO SUPPORT THE MOTION FOR THAT INVESTIGATION. WE WILL TAKE TURNS A YEAR, SENATOR. I LOVE THIS COMMITTEE BUT WE ARE NOT THE MAJORITY. SENATOR FLAKE HAS MADE CLEAR WHAT IT WOULD TAKE HIM TO BE COMFORTABLE ON A FINAL PASSAGE VOTE. IT DOESN'T MATTER WHAT WE SAY HERE, THIS WILL BE UP TO SENATOR SCHUMER IN SENATOR McCONNELL. SENATOR LEAHY HE? MR. CHAIRMAN, I WANT TO MAKE SURE BECAUSE THIS IS SOMEWHAT UNPRECEDENTED. WHEN I DO AGREE WITH THE SENATOR FROM ARIZONA THAT WE SHOULD HAVE THIS FURTHER INVESTIGATION. SO MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT DURING THE WEEK THAT THAT IS TAKING PLACE, THERE WILL BE NO ACTION ON THE FLOOR OF THE UNITED STATES SENATE ON THIS NOMINATION. IS THAT CORRECT? I CANNOT SAY THAT LET ME SAY AGAIN. I CAN'T MAKE THAT STATEMENT FOR THE LEADERSHIP. I CAN ONLY SAY THAT I WOULD BE ONLY COMFORTABLE MOVING FORWARD ON THE FLOOR, I WILL MOVE IT OUT OF COMMITTEE. BUT I WILL ONLY BE COMFORTABLE MOVING ON THE FLOOR UNTIL THE FBI HAS DONE MORE INVESTIGATION THAN THEY HAVE ALREADY. IT MAY NOT TAKE THEM A WEEK. I UNDERSTANDING THAT SOME OF THESE WITNESSES MAY NOT WANT TO DISCUSS ANYTHING FURTHER. BUT, I THINK WE OWE THEM DUE DILIGENCE. FROM CHAIRMAN. MR. CHAIRMAN. JUST A MINUTE. ALL I HAVE SAID TO SENATOR FLAKE IS THAT I WOULD ADVOCATE FOR THE POSITION HE TOOK BUT I DON'T CONTROL THAT SENATOR? MR. CHAIRMAN. YES. SENATOR KLOBUCHAR. MR. CHAIRMAN, THERE ARE OTHER SENATORS AS WELL WHO MAY BE INTERESTED IN THIS NEGOTIATION ON THE REPUBLICAN SIDE AND THERE IS NOT REALLY A SET AGREEMENT HERE. ALL OF US HAVE ALREADY SAID WE ARE VOTING NO. IT IS SENATOR FLAKE WORKING WITH ALL OF US TO SAY FOR THE GOOD OF THE SENATE AND THE GOOD OF THE COURT, THE AMERICAN TEAM DESERVE TO HAVE THE FACTS FOLLOWED UP ON. AND I REALLY APPRECIATE HIS WILLINGNESS TO DO THAT. AND THAT IS WHAT THIS IS ABOUT. THIS IS SIMPLY ABOUT AND BY THE WAY, IF SENATOR MCCONNELL WANTS TO GO FORWARD IN LIGHT OF THAT AND WE STILL HAVE SEVERAL SENATORS THAT HAVEN'T SAID HOW THEY ARE VOTING ON THIS NOMINEE, I ACTUALLY THINK THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT WHAT JUST HAPPENED RIGHT NOW. IT DOESN'T HAVE TO HAVE AN AGREEMENT. IT IS ONE SENATOR WHO IS STANDING UP. SENATOR CORNYN? MR. CHAIRMAN, I JUST WANT TO EXPRESS MY APPRECIATION TO SENATOR FLAKE FOR ALLOWING THIS PROCESS TO MOVE FORWARD. THERE IS SOME DIFFERENCE OF OPINION AMONG US AS TO WHAT EXACTLY THE FBI INVESTIGATION WOULD CONSIST OF. SOME OF US THINK IT HAS BEEN CONCLUDED AND SUM ELEMENT SUPPLEMENTED BY THIS COMMITTEE'S INVESTIGATION OTHERS DISAGREE WITH THAT I RESPECT THE FACT THAT NOT ONLY SENATOR FLAKE ADVOCATED TO GIVE DR. FORD A CHANCE TO APPEAR IN FRONT OF THE COMMITTEE, WHICH WAS THE RIGHT THING TO DO, BUT ALSO THAT HE HAS ALLOWED THIS PROCESS TO MOVE FORWARD, SUBJECT TO FURTHER DISCUSSIONS ABOUT WHAT THE FBI MAY OR MAY NOT BE ABLE TO COME UP WITH. BUT, CERTAINLY, HE MAINTAINS HIS RIGHT TO CAST HIS VOTE YEA OR NEY AS HE SEES FIT AND MAINTAINS SIGNIFICANT LEVERAGE THAT WAY. BUT, I APPRECIATE HIS SUPPORT FOR A FULL AND FAIR HEARING FOR DR. FORD AND JUDGE KAVANAUGH AS WELL AS HIS WILLINGNESS TO ALLOW THIS TO GO FORWARD SUBJECT TO HIS REQUEST. MR. CHAIRMAN. SENATOR BLUMENTHAL, OUGHT TO CALL ON SENATOR FEINSTEIN. IF I, THROUGH THE CHAIR, COULD HAVE ASK A QUESTION OF SENATOR FLAKE, DOES YOUR AMENDMENT INCLUDE CONTINUING THE INVESTIGATION DURING THIS PERIOD OF TIME? IF I CAN RESPOND, THERE IS NO AMENDMENT. I'M SIMPLY STATING THE DISCUSSION THAT WE HAD BETWEEN US ALL AS S. THAT I WOULD HOPE AND I THINK WE HAD SOME AGREEMENT BEFORE HA THE DEMOCRATS WHO HAVE BEEN, I THINK, JUSTIFIABLY UNCOMFORTABLE MOVING AHEAD COULD PUBLICLY, IN AN EFFORT TO BRING THIS COUNTRY TOGETHER, SAY THAT WE WOULD FEEL BETTER, I'M NOT EXPECTING THEM TO VOTE YES, BUT NOT TO COMPLAIN THAT AN FBI INVESTIGATION HAS NOT OCCURRED. AND THIS IS WHAT I'M TRYING TO DO. THIS COUNTRY IS BEING RIPPED APART HERE. AND WE HAVE GOT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE DO DUE DILIGENCE. I THINK THIS COMMITTEE HAS DONE A GOOD JOB, BUT I DO THINK THAT WE CAN HAVE A SHORT PAUSE AND MAKE SURE THAT THE FBI CAN INVESTIGATE. MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT SOME OF US WOULD HAVE TO AND I'M PREPARED TO DO IT, MAKE A REQUEST TO THE WHITE HOUSE TO ASK THE FBI TO DO THAT INVESTIGATION. IT WOULD BE SHORT, AND LIMITED IN SCOPE TO THE CURRENT ALLEGATIONS THAT HAVE BEEN MADE. BUT, I WOULD JUST ENCOURAGE THE DEMOCRATS WHO WE TALKED TO BEFORE TO ENDORSE THAT KIND OF THING, THAT WE CAN
