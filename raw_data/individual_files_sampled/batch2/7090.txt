Trump's so-called election panel has asked all 50 states for voter role information essentially information on every voter in these states now Kansas secretary of state Kris Kobach who also happens to be the vice chairman of president Trump's Commission on election integrity is seeking several pieces of information about voters including their names birthdays the last four digits of their social security numbers and their voting history dating back to 2006 now the letter that was sent to the secretaries of state of all 50 states was obtained by the hill so the hill did the reporting on this and it direct states to turn over publicly available voter role data including if publicly available under the laws of your state the full first and last names of all registrants middle names or initials if available addresses dates of birth political party last four digits of Social Security if available and voter history from 2006 onward so this story was a late addition to our rundown today Michael Shore came in and he's like we need to cover this and so I want to actually throw it to you first to get your commentary what do you think why is this so problematic well it's first of all it's problematic because it's an invasion of privacy and this is somebody who has spent a good deal of his time trying to suppress votes he is an anti immigrant he's somebody who helped craft he's from Kansas remember but he helped craft craft SB 1070 in Arizona that very frightfully racist piece of legislation that was targeting immigrants in Arizona did something similar in Arkansas he's from Kansas let's keep reminding you guys he's the Kansas secretary of state and the SB 1070 was from several years ago so I just want to make sure that you guys are up-to-date on that it would essentially allow police officials to ask anyone for proof that they're in the country legally right so it essentially gave them a pass to profile people who weren't white and so yeah there were a lot of backlash it was like having a you know a national ID card practically which is something that we in this country don't have and there's their reasons to and not to have that but this is not this is not coming from the purest place so he is and he is a guy who has consistently said that there is voter fraud rampant voter fraud in this country supported the president when the president has said millions of fraudulent votes in the 2016 election and he is also someone who said he had all this proof for what happened in New Hampshire the reason Trump lost New Hampshire was because there were so many false votes of people coming in from Massachusetts to vote in New Hampshire none of this 0 was proven he is also the only state secretary of state in in the country who has the power to prosecute voter fraud and because he kind of granted himself that power in in a legislature like Kansas that is you know a majority Republican conservative legislature was able to get that power he has prosecuted some cases a handful a couple some where overturned on an appeal there is not a problem this is not a problem in America this administration and this guy think that it is so going after everybody on every voter roll down to Social Security numbers and so of course he's getting pushed back Terry McAuliffe the governor of Virginia said we are not going to participate maril in Connecticut she said we're not going to participate well participate with some of it we're not going to give information that isn't already public you know there's a guy called Jay Ashcroft I don't if you ever heard that name he's the secretary of state in Missouri and he has said that it's a great idea will participate it's funny where you're bedfellows come but that's that's so that's the hold of it this is dangerous this is voter suppression this is getting people this is intimidating people to register to vote if you have a felony if you don't if you have a misdemeanor if you are worried that you have something in your checkered past and you know that your social security number and your information and your address if you are being stalked if you are a woman who is abused and you don't want this information public then you're not going to give it and if registering to vote means you have to give it you're not gonna register to vote and guess who goes home happy yeah yeah and it's it's it's interesting that you bring that up because for me personally as I was reading the story the publishing of this information which they do intend on doing the letter also stipulates the documents submitted to the Commission will also be made available to the public first of all I I think most Americans regardless of where you lie on the political spectrum understand that when you publish information that contains things like your address and the last four digits of your social security number I mean you are just creating a wealth of information for people who want to hack into financial accounts and things like that so that's of course a concern of mine another concern is that this could be used as a form of political intimidation right the Trump administration is collecting data on you and they know who you voted for and how you voted since 2006 but finally it what if you are a public figure such as myself and you want to protect your address right and you've gone to extreme lengths to protect your address now this information is gonna be publicized no that's insane right and so it will absolutely discourage people from registering to vote well in a simple computer search to come up with your name and address in a nanosecond yeah I mean once these things once these files are available that way then it'll be very easy to find any of our our names and addresses and any American that you want to to to violate in terms of their privacy in that fashion well it's thought of the the voting process is so sacred here it's weird how you know you grow up with that sense that voting in America is really a sacred process and we celebrate it and we say this is the best process politically in the world I mean whether or not that's even true anymore but you have a sense of that the sanctity of what's going on with that vote and with your registration and now it's it's it's odd and if I can say almost unamerican to have it pierced this way sure you can say that mark okay well I just said okay yeah you're right though it is and it's it's when you you know John Lewis is in the Congress he'll probably have a thing or two to say about this this is another executive order from your president and he is following through on these the the this actually isn't the Commission itself was it was created out of executive order this is bad news voter intimidation in America has always gone on it's always come from one party in modern history it continues to and it has to be stopped and this is this is constitutionally challenging but if this is actually ties in this ties in with the other theme of this guy who's so true driven by ego that he's chasing this crap that he was throwing around about the election and all the illegal votes he thinks he won New Hampshire you're right mark he wants everybody to think he won New Hampshire and this is everyone thought that he was gonna drop this stuff once he became president hey you won like you dropped the Hillary Clinton thing you know lock her up let's drop it already I mean you're in now but he's not he's he's chasing this because he wants to say no dammit you're not dropping this I said it and you're not gonna make me a fool in fact I'm an established Commission to investigate this by the way commissioners cost money so it does cost taxpayer money to chase this guy's ego dream whatever it is this is gonna cost a ton of money it's gonna cost States money too cuz the states are gonna have to put these rolls together and even if I decide they don't want to put the rolls together they're gonna have to contestant Courtley and that's gonna cost money it's it cuz this guy's ego trip I know what you're thinking jank what do I get if I'm a young tourist member well I'm
