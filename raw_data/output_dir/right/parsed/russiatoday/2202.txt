reports now of a significant development
in the Syrian enclave of eastern Goethe
near Damascus hundreds of civilians are
now leaving the area controlled by rebel
and terror groups via a humanitarian
corridor established by Russia and Syria
these are live pictures from the area
we're showing you now the humanitarian
corridors were set up as part of an
effort to implement a UN resolution on a
ceasefire in Syria
however civilians rarely used them with
reports of militants taking hostages and
opening fire on those attempting to flee
the Syrian government's anti-terror
operation has forced many militants to
cut deals to let civilians go in
exchange for their own safety
