1
00:00:01,103 --> 00:00:02,371
THAT I COULD SAY TOO.

2
00:00:02,371 --> 00:00:06,208
IF I SAID THEM, HE'D NEVER BE

3
00:00:06,208 --> 00:00:06,842
ELECTED AGAIN.

4
00:00:06,842 --> 00:00:08,277
GRIFF: PRESIDENT TRUMP SLAMMING

5
00:00:08,277 --> 00:00:09,211
MONTANA SENATOR JOHN TESTER

6
00:00:09,211 --> 00:00:11,213
AFTER THE SECRET SERVICE

7
00:00:11,213 --> 00:00:12,781
DISPUTED ALLEGATIONS AGAINST

8
00:00:12,781 --> 00:00:15,551
RONNY JACKSON, SO IN A STATE

9
00:00:15,551 --> 00:00:17,252
WHERE TRUMP WON 57% OF THE VOTE

10
00:00:17,252 --> 00:00:19,221
JUST HOW VULNERABLE IS SENATOR

11
00:00:19,221 --> 00:00:20,956
TESTER IN THE MID-TERM ELECTIONS

12
00:00:20,956 --> 00:00:22,992
HERE TO BREAK IT DOWN DEPUTY

13
00:00:22,992 --> 00:00:25,995
NEWS EDITOR ALEXIA MCHAMMOND HOW

14
00:00:25,995 --> 00:00:26,528
ARE YOU?

15
00:00:26,528 --> 00:00:27,896
>>  GOOD MORNING I'M GOOD THANK

16
00:00:27,896 --> 00:00:28,897
YOU FOR HAVING ME.

17
00:00:28,897 --> 00:00:30,532
GRIFF: THIS IS GOING TO BE A BIG

18
00:00:30,532 --> 00:00:30,966
RACE.

19
00:00:30,966 --> 00:00:32,601
WHAT IS YOUR REACTION TO WHAT'S

20
00:00:32,601 --> 00:00:33,936
NOW CLEARLY BEEN A RACE THAT THE

21
00:00:33,936 --> 00:00:36,672
PRESIDENT IS GOING TO PUT

22
00:00:36,672 --> 00:00:37,906
ESSENTIALLY A BULLSEYE ON

23
00:00:37,906 --> 00:00:39,041
SENATOR TESTER'S BACK?

24
00:00:39,041 --> 00:00:40,643
>>  SENATOR TESTER IS PERHAPS

25
00:00:40,643 --> 00:00:42,678
THE MOST VULNERABLE DEMOCRATIC

26
00:00:42,678 --> 00:00:44,747
SENATOR IN THIS 2018 ELECTION.

27
00:00:44,747 --> 00:00:47,483
I'VE REPORTED ON THAT FOR AXIOS,

28
00:00:47,483 --> 00:00:49,551
AS YOU JUST MENTIONED NOW TRUMP

29
00:00:49,551 --> 00:00:52,521
WON HIS STATE OF MONTANA BY 20

30
00:00:52,521 --> 00:00:56,158
POINTS IN 20156, BUT CHAIRED TO

31
00:00:56,158 --> 00:00:57,726
TRUMP'S 58% IN A STATE WHICH IS

32
00:00:57,726 --> 00:00:58,894
MUCH HIGHER THAN HIS NATIONAL

33
00:00:58,894 --> 00:01:00,195
AVERAGE WHICH SUGGESTS AND SHOWS

34
00:01:00,195 --> 00:01:02,197
THAT MONTANA LOVES THE PRESIDENT

35
00:01:02,197 --> 00:01:04,066
AND YOU KNOW SENATOR TESTER IS

36
00:01:04,066 --> 00:01:05,968
AN INTERESTING SENATOR BECAUSE

37
00:01:05,968 --> 00:01:07,936
ALTHOUGH HE'S IN A VULNERABLE

38
00:01:07,936 --> 00:01:09,171
POSITION, HE DOESN'T ALWAYS ACT

39
00:01:09,171 --> 00:01:09,905
LIKE IT.

40
00:01:09,905 --> 00:01:11,707
HE IS THE ONLY RED STATE

41
00:01:11,707 --> 00:01:13,442
DEMOCRATIC SENATOR WHO VOTED

42
00:01:13,442 --> 00:01:14,576
AGAINST MIKE POMPEO AS SECRETARY

43
00:01:14,576 --> 00:01:16,512
OF STATE AND IN JANUARY HE VOTED

44
00:01:16,512 --> 00:01:17,346
TWICE AGAINST THE GOVERNMENT

45
00:01:17,346 --> 00:01:19,081
FUNDING BILL SO I THINK WE CAN

46
00:01:19,081 --> 00:01:22,484
FULLY EXPECT TRUMP TO SORT OF

47
00:01:22,484 --> 00:01:24,153
PRIORITIZE HIS SENATE RACE AND

48
00:01:24,153 --> 00:01:25,087
UNSEAT HIM COME NOVEMBER.

49
00:01:25,087 --> 00:01:26,388
GRIFF: NOW SENATOR TESTER IS

50
00:01:26,388 --> 00:01:27,923
ALSO WEIGHING IN PUTTING OUT A

51
00:01:27,923 --> 00:01:29,158
STATEMENT HERE WHERE HE SAYS

52
00:01:29,158 --> 00:01:31,160
IT'S MY DUTY TO MAKE SURE

53
00:01:31,160 --> 00:01:34,096
MONTANA VETERANS GET WHAT THEY

54
00:01:34,096 --> 00:01:35,831
NEED, AND HAVE EARNED AND I'LL

55
00:01:35,831 --> 00:01:38,167
NEVER STOP FIGHTING FOR THEM AS

56
00:01:38,167 --> 00:01:39,301
THEIR SENATOR.

57
00:01:39,301 --> 00:01:41,737
YOU KNOW, SENATOR TESTER ONLY

58
00:01:41,737 --> 00:01:43,906
WON THE 2012 RACE BY FOUR POINTS

59
00:01:43,906 --> 00:01:47,476
AND HE'S A MODERATE GUY IN THE

60
00:01:47,476 --> 00:01:49,712
MIDDLE TRYING TO PLAY BOTH SIDES

61
00:01:49,712 --> 00:01:51,146
AS YOU POINT OUT BUT YOU KNOW,

62
00:01:51,146 --> 00:01:54,416
HE HAD A REALLY BAD JANUARY DOWN

63
00:01:54,416 --> 00:01:55,050
18 POINTS.

64
00:01:55,050 --> 00:01:57,686
IS TESTER GOING TO BE A RACE

65
00:01:57,686 --> 00:01:59,855
WHERE DEMOCRATS BEGIN TO PULL

66
00:01:59,855 --> 00:02:01,857
RESOURCES OUT AND LET HIM FEND

67
00:02:01,857 --> 00:02:02,291
FOR HIS OWN?

68
00:02:02,291 --> 00:02:03,826
>>  I DON'T THINK WE CAN EXPECT

69
00:02:03,826 --> 00:02:04,126
THAT.

70
00:02:04,126 --> 00:02:05,861
I THINK IF ANYTHING WE WILL SEE

71
00:02:05,861 --> 00:02:07,096
DEMOCRATS SORT OF ADDING

72
00:02:07,096 --> 00:02:08,097
ADDITIONAL RESOURCES BECAUSE WE

73
00:02:08,097 --> 00:02:09,531
ARE SEEING HOW THE PRESIDENT IS

74
00:02:09,531 --> 00:02:10,598
GOING TO GET INVOLVED.

75
00:02:10,598 --> 00:02:12,201
THERE ARE A COUPLE OF THINGS

76
00:02:12,201 --> 00:02:13,602
THAT HELPED SENATOR TESTER.

77
00:02:13,602 --> 00:02:15,003
ONE IS THAT HE DOESN'T REALLY

78
00:02:15,003 --> 00:02:16,505
HAVE A STRONG FORMIDABLE

79
00:02:16,505 --> 00:02:18,507
REPUBLICAN CHALLENGER, AND HE'S

80
00:02:18,507 --> 00:02:19,108
OBVIOUSLY PART OF THE

81
00:02:19,108 --> 00:02:21,143
ADMINISTRATION NOW AND THE STATE

82
00:02:21,143 --> 00:02:22,111
ATTORNEY GENERAL DECIDED NOT TO

83
00:02:22,111 --> 00:02:23,545
RUN SO I THINK UNTIL THAT

84
00:02:23,545 --> 00:02:25,147
HAPPENS THAT COULD REALLY HELP

85
00:02:25,147 --> 00:02:27,516
TESTER IN HIS FAVOR BUT I WOULD

86
00:02:27,516 --> 00:02:28,517
EXPECT DEMOCRATS WOULD IF

87
00:02:28,517 --> 00:02:29,752
ANYTHING ADD ADDITIONAL

88
00:02:29,752 --> 00:00:00,000
RESOURCES TO HELP HIM.
