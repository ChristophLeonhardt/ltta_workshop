1
00:00:00,149 --> 00:00:05,290
MIKE POMPEO, THE HEAD OF THE
CIA AND TRUMP'S NOMINEE TO BE

2
00:00:05,290 --> 00:00:09,200
HIS SECRETARY OF STATE, HAS
APPARENTLY VISITED NORTH KOREA

3
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:11,450
AND SPOKEN TO OFFICIALS THERE.

4
00:00:11,450 --> 00:00:14,190
NOW, IT'S UNCLEAR IF THERE IS

5
00:00:14,190 --> 00:00:18,210
ANY REAL RESULT FROM THAT
MEETING, BUT TRUMP OF COURSE IS

6
00:00:18,210 --> 00:00:21,100
BRAGGING ABOUT IT, AND IN THE
MIDDLE OF DOING SO TWEETED

7
00:00:21,100 --> 00:00:22,760
SOMETHING THAT WAS INACCURATE.

8
00:00:22,760 --> 00:00:30,890
SO LET'S READ HIS TWEET AND I

9
00:00:30,890 --> 00:00:39,450
WILL TELL YOU WHAT IS INACCURATE
--

10
00:00:39,450 --> 00:00:40,450
>>

11
00:00:40,450 --> 00:00:42,360
>>OKAY.

12
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:46,780
SO THE PART OF THAT
TWEET THAT WAS NOT CORRECT HAD

13
00:00:46,780 --> 00:00:47,780
TO DO WITH THE TIMING --

14
00:00:47,780 --> 00:00:48,780
>>

15
00:00:48,780 --> 00:00:57,740
>>PEOPLE

16
00:00:57,740 --> 00:01:02,810
ARE GIVING HIM A HARD TIME ABOUT
THAT MISTAKE, BUT I'VE GOT TO BE

17
00:01:02,810 --> 00:01:05,601
HONEST WITH YOU, WHEN YOU LOOK
AT TRUMP AS A WHOLE AND ALL THE

18
00:01:05,601 --> 00:01:08,810
OTHER THINGS HE HAS TWEETED IN
THE PAST, THIS IS A SMALL ERROR.

19
00:01:08,810 --> 00:01:12,040
>>IT'S UNSURPRISING THAT HE HAD
NO IDEA WHEN THE MEETING

20
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:14,000
HAPPENED, HE DOESN'T DO HIS
HOMEWORK, ETC., BUT WE'VE BEEN

21
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,090
THROUGH THAT.

22
00:01:15,090 --> 00:01:17,420
ASS, IN TRUMP
WORLD THIS IS A TINY AIR

23
00:01:17,420 --> 00:01:20,830
COMPARED TO THE GIGANTIC
MISTAKES HE NORMALLY MAKES,

24
00:01:20,830 --> 00:01:24,920
INCLUDING IN THIS CASE TO ME THE
MUCH MORE INTERESTING PART WAS

25
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:27,820
HIM BLURTING OUT THAT WE ARE
HAVING VERY HIGH-LEVEL MEETINGS.

26
00:01:27,820 --> 00:01:31,590
>>THAT WAS THE PART I WAS ABOUT
TO GET TO, REPORTERS WERE TRYING

27
00:01:31,590 --> 00:01:36,620
TO DIG AROUND AND ASK ABOUT THIS
MEETING BECAUSE YESTERDAY TRUMP

28
00:01:36,620 --> 00:01:40,010
HAD BRAGGED ABOUT HOW THERE ARE
MEETINGS HAPPENING WITH NORTH

29
00:01:40,010 --> 00:01:43,190
KOREAN OFFICIALS AT VERY HIGH
LEVELS, AND SO OF COURSE THAT'S

30
00:01:43,190 --> 00:01:45,601
VAGUE AND PEOPLE WANTED TO KNOW
WHAT IS GOING ON, AND WHEN

31
00:01:45,601 --> 00:01:50,600
REPORTERS WERE ASKED THEY WERE
BASIC WE TOLD, HMM, WE DON'T

32
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:57,060
DISCUSS THE CIA AND THE
DIRECTOR'S TRAVEL.

33
00:01:57,060 --> 00:01:58,060
AND THEN

34
00:01:58,060 --> 00:02:00,979
TRUMP TWEETS THIS TODAY AND
ESSENTIALLY GOES AGAINST WHAT

35
00:02:00,979 --> 00:02:03,530
OTHER WHITE HOUSE OFFICIALS HAD
TOLD THE MEDIA.

36
00:02:03,530 --> 00:02:06,200
SO THESE ARE ALL THINGS TO TAKE
INTO CONSIDERATION, AGAIN

37
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:08,959
YET ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF TRUMP
GOING BACK AND FORTH ON

38
00:02:08,959 --> 00:02:11,190
CERTAIN THINGS, THE WHITE HOUSE
GOING BACK AND FORTH ON

39
00:02:11,190 --> 00:02:12,260
CERTAIN THINGS.

40
00:02:12,260 --> 00:02:16,279
>>THE GUY IS SUCH A CHILD.

41
00:02:16,279 --> 00:02:18,739
YOU
KNOW, I GROW TIRED OF SAYING IT,

42
00:02:18,739 --> 00:02:22,390
BUT YOU CAN'T NORMALIZE HOW
STUPID HE IS.

43
00:02:22,390 --> 00:02:23,989
SO ALL THE ADULTS

44
00:02:23,989 --> 00:02:29,030
GO, OKAY -- AND BY THE WAY, ON
THE SUBSTANCE OF THIS, IN TERMS

45
00:02:29,030 --> 00:02:33,249
OF NORTH KOREA NEGOTIATIONS WITH
SOUTH KOREA, I LOVE IT.

46
00:02:33,249 --> 00:02:34,249
I'M NOT

47
00:02:34,249 --> 00:02:37,980
AGAINST TRUMP' IS POLICY, SUCH
AS IT IS, FOR TODAY.

48
00:02:37,980 --> 00:02:39,080
OKAY?

49
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:40,080
BUT

50
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:41,159
YOU HAVE TO CALL IT LIKE IT IS.

51
00:02:41,159 --> 00:02:43,400
SO TRUMP -- ALL THE ADULTS GO

52
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:47,529
HEY, NOW THIS IS DELICATE, WE
WANT TO EXECUTE THIS POLICY IN A

53
00:02:47,529 --> 00:02:52,090
CORRECT WAY SO WE CAN ACTUALLY
GET TO PEACE, SO PLEASE DON'T

54
00:02:52,090 --> 00:02:55,510
TELL PEOPLE THAT THE HEAD OF OUR
CIA AND THE GUY YOU NOMINATED TO

55
00:02:55,510 --> 00:02:57,939
BE OUR SECRETARY OF STATE IS
GOING AND HAS PERSONALLY MET

56
00:02:57,939 --> 00:02:58,939
WITH KIM JONG-UN.

57
00:02:58,939 --> 00:03:02,279
HE'S LIKE, GOT
IT, NOT TALKING ABOUT IT.

58
00:03:02,279 --> 00:03:03,279
THEN

59
00:03:03,279 --> 00:03:05,730
HE GOES IN FRONT OF THE PRESS,
YOU WON'T BELIEVE WHAT I KNOW.

60
00:03:05,730 --> 00:03:07,569
OH, JESUS CHRIST.

61
00:03:07,569 --> 00:03:11,139
IT'S VERY HIGH
LEVEL, I CAN'T TELL YOU, BUT

62
00:03:11,139 --> 00:03:12,340
VERY HIGH-LEVEL.

63
00:03:12,340 --> 00:03:14,099
WHAT DID YOU
THINK PEOPLE WERE GOING TO DO?

64
00:03:14,099 --> 00:03:15,879
THEY ARE GOING TO ASK, WHAT HIGH
LEVEL?

65
00:03:15,879 --> 00:03:17,069
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING

66
00:03:17,069 --> 00:03:18,069
ABOUT?

67
00:03:18,069 --> 00:03:21,879
AND THE NEXT MORNING, HIS
OWN WHITE HOUSE PUTS OUT

68
00:03:21,879 --> 00:03:26,890
STATEMENTS -- NO, NO, THESE
RUMORS ARE NOT EXACTLY RIGHT,

69
00:03:26,890 --> 00:03:29,159
AND BLAH BLAH, IN THE NEXT
MORNING HE'S LIKE I'VE GOT A

70
00:03:29,159 --> 00:03:35,989
GREAT IDEA, I WILL DO A TWEET,
MIKE POMPEO MET WITH KIM

71
00:03:35,989 --> 00:03:36,989
JONG-UN.

72
00:03:36,989 --> 00:03:40,000
EVEN WHEN HE'S RIGHT HE FINDS A
WAY TO SCREW IT UP SO ROYALLY.

73
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,969
>>YES, AND EVEN WHEN HE'S RIGHT
DON'T GET EXCITED BECAUSE YOU

74
00:03:43,969 --> 00:03:47,230
DON'T KNOW HOW LONG HE'S GOING
TO REMAIN ON THE RIGHT SIDE OF

75
00:03:47,230 --> 00:03:48,230
THE ISSUE.

76
00:03:48,230 --> 00:03:52,980
NOW, LOOK, I AM HAPPY
THAT THE APPROACH TOWARD NORTH

77
00:03:52,980 --> 00:03:56,900
KOREA HAS CHANGED CONSIDERABLY,
BECAUSE NOT TOO LONG AGO TRUMP

78
00:03:56,900 --> 00:04:00,199
WAS TWEETING OUT THINGS TOWARD
KIM JONG-UN, MAKING FUN OF HIS

79
00:04:00,199 --> 00:04:03,089
PHYSICAL APPEARANCE, TALKING
ABOUT HOW HIS NUCLEAR BUTTON IS

80
00:04:03,089 --> 00:04:05,620
BIGGER THAN KIM JONG-UN'S
NUCLEAR BUTTON, JUST

81
00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:10,699
EMBARRASSING THE COUNTRY AS HE
DOES, BUT WHAT HE'S SAYING NOW

82
00:04:10,699 --> 00:04:14,499
IS GOOD IN A DIPLOMATIC SENSE,
BUT HE NOW ALSO KIND OF COMES

83
00:04:14,499 --> 00:04:17,738
OFF AS INCREDIBLY NAÅ“VE, AND
THIS IS FOLLOWING THE MEETING

84
00:04:17,738 --> 00:04:21,089
WITH POMPEO, SO I WANT TO READ
YOU A QUOTE FROM DONALD TRUMP.

85
00:04:21,089 --> 00:04:25,060
HE SAID -- I BELIEVE THERE'S A
LOT OF GOODWILL, THEY DO RESPECT

86
00:04:25,060 --> 00:04:29,440
US, MEANING NORTH KOREA, WE'RE
RESPECTFUL OF THEM.

87
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:36,650
>>HE CALLED KIM JONG-UN ROCKET
MAN BEFORE, HE SAID THE FAMOUS

88
00:04:36,650 --> 00:04:41,810
LINE ABOUT HOW WE WERE GOING TO
HAVE FIRE AND FURY AND USE POWER

89
00:04:41,810 --> 00:04:44,880
THE LIKES OF WHICH THE WORLD HAS
NEVER SEEN BEFORE.

90
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:45,880
HE BASICALLY

91
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:47,900
THREATENED TO NUKE THEM BEFORE,
HE CALLED THE GOVERNMENT OF

92
00:04:47,900 --> 00:04:51,970
NORTH KOREA CRUEL AND BARBARIC,
WHICH IS TRUE BY THE WAY.

93
00:04:51,970 --> 00:04:52,970
NOW

94
00:04:52,970 --> 00:04:56,349
HE'S LIKE THEY SAID SOME NICE
THINGS ABOUT ME, THEY RESPECT ME

95
00:04:56,349 --> 00:04:58,470
SO I SHOW A LITTLE RESPECT BACK,
OKAY?

96
00:04:58,470 --> 00:05:00,790
OH, WE ARE LED BY A TOTAL

97
00:05:00,790 --> 00:05:02,080
IMBECILE.

98
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:07,060
>>HE'S THE EASIEST PERSON,
EASIEST PERSON, TO MANIPULATE

99
00:05:07,060 --> 00:05:08,509
WHEN YOU REALLY THINK ABOUT IT.

100
00:05:08,509 --> 00:05:10,169
BECAUSE ALL YOU NEED TO DO IF

101
00:05:10,169 --> 00:05:13,270
YOU WANT TO MANIPULATE HIM AND
YOU WANT TO GET SOMETHING OUT OF

102
00:05:13,270 --> 00:05:16,530
HIM IS JUST COMPLEMENT HIM.

103
00:05:16,530 --> 00:05:17,530
>>IT'S THAT SIMPLE.

104
00:05:17,530 --> 00:05:20,760
>>SAY POSITIVE THINGS ABOUT HIM,
SAY YOU SUPPORT HIM, NEVER TRY

105
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:23,590
TO CROSS HIM, DON'T GIVE THE
APPEARANCE THAT YOU HAVE

106
00:05:23,590 --> 00:05:26,550
AMBITIONS TO REPLACE THEM, YOU
WILL BE FINE, YOU WILL GET WHAT

107
00:05:26,550 --> 00:05:27,550
YOU WANT.

108
00:05:27,550 --> 00:05:31,509
IN FACT THE LEADER OF
JAPAN IS DOING THIS BALANCING

109
00:05:31,509 --> 00:05:35,680
ACT RIGHT NOW BECAUSE HE WANTS
TO ENSURE THAT THESE TARIFFS

110
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:39,389
THAT TRUMP IS IMPOSING ON OTHER
COUNTRIES THAT DO TRADE WITH US

111
00:05:39,389 --> 00:05:42,069
DON'T AFFECT HIS COUNTRY, HE
DOESN'T WANT JAPAN TO BE

112
00:05:42,069 --> 00:05:46,280
IMPACTED, AND SO, YOU KNOW, HE'S
HAVING ALL THESE CALLS AND

113
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:50,180
MEETINGS WITH HIM EVEN THOUGH IT
MIGHT NOT BE POLITICALLY SAVVY

114
00:05:50,180 --> 00:05:52,780
TO DO SO, CONSIDERING HOW
THE U.S.

115
00:05:52,780 --> 00:05:54,849
IS APPROACHING NORTH KOREA RIGHT
NOW.

116
00:05:54,849 --> 00:05:58,469
>>OKAY, MORE CONTEXT ON THAT,
EVERY PART OF THIS IS AMAZING,

117
00:05:58,469 --> 00:06:02,439
SO PRIME MINISTER ABE GOES TO
MAR-A-LAGO, SPENDS TWO DAYS WITH

118
00:06:02,439 --> 00:06:05,659
DONALD TRUMP, TRUMP IN THE
MIDDLE OF IT ANNOUNCES THAT

119
00:06:05,659 --> 00:06:09,310
POMPEO IS GOING TO MEET
PERSONALLY WITH KIM JONG-UN.

120
00:06:09,310 --> 00:06:10,310
THE

121
00:06:10,310 --> 00:06:11,830
GOVERNMENT OF JAPAN IS NOT IN
FAVOR OF THAT.

122
00:06:11,830 --> 00:06:14,240
SO ABE IS LIKE,

123
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:15,240
WHAT?

124
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:17,900
YOU GUYS ARE MEETING WITH
THE NORTH KOREANS?

125
00:06:17,900 --> 00:06:18,979
OKAY.

126
00:06:18,979 --> 00:06:19,979
OF

127
00:06:19,979 --> 00:06:20,979
COURSE EVERYTHING IS GOING TO BE
FINE.

128
00:06:20,979 --> 00:06:21,979
BUT THEN HE'S LIKE WHAT

129
00:06:21,979 --> 00:06:22,979
ARE YOU GOING TO DO WITH THIS
GUY?

130
00:06:22,979 --> 00:06:23,979
BUT HE NEEDS TO MAKE SURE

131
00:06:23,979 --> 00:06:27,060
THEY AREN'T INCLUDED IN THE
SANCTIONS, SO HE HAS TO SIT

132
00:06:27,060 --> 00:06:29,090
THERE AND KISS DONALD TRUMP'S
ASS.

133
00:06:29,090 --> 00:06:33,150
IT'S SO HUMILIATING, SO HE

134
00:06:33,150 --> 00:06:36,669
GOES OUT AND HE'S LIKE, OH, MR.

135
00:06:36,669 --> 00:06:37,720
TRUMP, DONALD, YOU HAVE BEEN

136
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:38,720
FANTASTIC.

137
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:41,610
IT IS YOUR GREAT
COURAGE AND LEADERSHIP THAT HAS

138
00:06:41,610 --> 00:06:45,170
BROUGHT THIS TO A GOOD SITUATION
THAT WE ARE IN NOW.

139
00:06:45,170 --> 00:06:46,170
SOMEBODY

140
00:06:46,170 --> 00:06:47,210
HELP ME.

141
00:06:47,210 --> 00:06:48,660
RIGHT?

142
00:06:48,660 --> 00:06:50,889
BECAUSE THEY ALL
HAVE TO APPEASE THE MANCHILD,

143
00:06:50,889 --> 00:06:55,150
OTHERWISE HE WILL DO SOMETHING
STUPID AND BREAK ALL THE

144
00:06:55,150 --> 00:06:56,150
FURNITURE.

145
00:06:56,150 --> 00:06:59,460
I WANT TO GO BACK TO
ONE OTHER QUOTE FROM TRUMP ON

146
00:06:59,460 --> 00:07:00,460
NORTH KOREA.

147
00:07:00,460 --> 00:07:03,569
AND THEN GET TO
WHAT SHOULD BE ACTUALLY DO.

148
00:07:03,569 --> 00:07:08,900
EARLIER HE HAD SAID WITHOUT US,
AND WITHOUT ME IN PARTICULAR, I

149
00:07:08,900 --> 00:07:11,099
GUESS YOU WOULD HAVE TO SAY THAT
YOU WOULDN'T BE DISCUSSING

150
00:07:11,099 --> 00:07:14,400
ANYTHING, INCLUDING THE
OLYMPICS, WHICH WOULD HAVE BEEN

151
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:15,999
A FAILURE.

152
00:07:15,999 --> 00:07:17,949
SO HE'S SAYING THAT
NORTH AND SOUTH KOREA, WHICH ARE

153
00:07:17,949 --> 00:07:23,550
NOW DISCUSSING A PEACE TREATY,
RIGHT NOW THEY ARE IN AN

154
00:07:23,550 --> 00:07:26,289
ARMISTICE, SO THE WAR NEVER
TECHNICALLY ENDED, TRUMP OF

155
00:07:26,289 --> 00:07:30,379
COURSE SAID NOBODY KNOWS THAT --
OKAY, MOST PEOPLE DON'T KNOW

156
00:07:30,379 --> 00:07:32,629
THAT, THAT IS AN INTERESTING
FACT, BUT PEOPLE WHO ARE IN

157
00:07:32,629 --> 00:07:33,750
POLITICS KNOW IT.

158
00:07:33,750 --> 00:07:35,370
PEOPLE WHO ARE
PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES

159
00:07:35,370 --> 00:07:36,370
KNOW IT.

160
00:07:36,370 --> 00:07:37,930
BUT OF COURSE HE JUST
FOUND OUT.

161
00:07:37,930 --> 00:07:38,930
HE'S LIKE, DID YOU

162
00:07:38,930 --> 00:07:39,930
KNOW?

163
00:07:39,930 --> 00:07:41,819
NOBODY KNOWS, THAT WAR
DIDN'T ACTUALLY END, IT'S IN AN

164
00:07:41,819 --> 00:07:42,819
ARMISTICE.

165
00:07:42,819 --> 00:07:46,210
SO THEY ARE
DISCUSSING A PEACE TREATY, SO

166
00:07:46,210 --> 00:07:47,210
WHAT DOES TRUMP SAY?

167
00:07:47,210 --> 00:07:48,210
THEY
COULDN'T HAVE DONE IT WITHOUT

168
00:07:48,210 --> 00:07:53,080
ME, THEY WOULDN'T EVEN HAVE THE
OLYMPICS TOGETHER.

169
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:56,810
>>BUT THEY DID IT DESPITE YOU.

170
00:07:56,810 --> 00:08:00,099
BECAUSE HIS RHETORIC WAS SO

171
00:08:00,099 --> 00:08:04,979
TERRIFYING THAT LEADERS IN SOUTH
KOREA WERE LIKE, OKAY, LET'S

172
00:08:04,979 --> 00:08:07,069
FIND A WAY TO DE-ESCALATE THIS
SITUATION.

173
00:08:07,069 --> 00:08:08,130
SOUTH KOREA HAD TO BE

174
00:08:08,130 --> 00:08:12,490
THE ADULT IN THE ROOM AND GET
INTO DIRECT TALKS WITH NORTH

175
00:08:12,490 --> 00:08:13,490
KOREA.

176
00:08:13,490 --> 00:08:16,380
SO I GUESS HE'S KIND OF
RIGHT, YES, YOU ARE SO UNHINGED

177
00:08:16,380 --> 00:08:20,490
AND UNSTABLE THAT OTHER WORLD
LEADERS HAVE TO BASICALLY TAKE A

178
00:08:20,490 --> 00:08:25,469
LEADERSHIP ROLE IN THE
INTERNATIONAL WAY AND REACH OUT

179
00:08:25,469 --> 00:08:26,680
TO NORTH KOREA ON THEIR OWN.

180
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:28,580
I
MEAN, HE'S CRAZY, HE'S CRAZY,

181
00:08:28,580 --> 00:08:32,390
AND IT'S SCARY WHEN YOU CONSIDER
HOW UNSTABLE HE IS WHEN IT COMES

182
00:08:32,390 --> 00:08:34,419
TO THESE INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT
ISSUES.

183
00:08:34,419 --> 00:08:36,990
>>REPUBLICANS, IT REALLY DOESN'T
BOTHER YOU WHEN HE SAYS THINGS

184
00:08:36,990 --> 00:08:40,280
LIKE THE OLYMPUS WOULD HAVE BEEN
A FAILURE WITHOUT HIM?

185
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:41,280
IF YOU

186
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:43,179
HAD A PERSON LIKE THAT IN YOUR
REAL LIFE WENT AROUND BRAGGING

187
00:08:43,179 --> 00:08:46,460
ABOUT THINGS THEY HAD NOTHING TO
DO WITH AND MADE GRANDIOSE,

188
00:08:46,460 --> 00:08:49,350
PREPOSTEROUS STATEMENTS, LIKE
THE GUY DOESN'T COME TO YOUR

189
00:08:49,350 --> 00:08:51,650
WEDDING AND HE SAYS THE WEDDING
WOULD HAVE BEEN A FAILURE

190
00:08:51,650 --> 00:08:53,670
WITHOUT ME, YOU WOULD BE LIKE,
WHO ARE YOU?

191
00:08:53,670 --> 00:08:54,670
YOU ARE THE WORST

192
00:08:54,670 --> 00:08:56,070
PERSON IN THE WORLD.

193
00:08:56,070 --> 00:08:57,070
I BROUGHT
YOU AND YOUR WIFE TOGETHER.

194
00:08:57,070 --> 00:08:58,070
YOU

195
00:08:58,070 --> 00:08:59,070
DON'T EVEN KNOW MY WIFE.

196
00:08:59,070 --> 00:09:02,570
THE GUY
IS AN EGOMANIAC, AND YOU READ

197
00:09:02,570 --> 00:09:08,230
THAT STUFF, OH YEAH, OLYMPICS, A
FAILURE WITHOUT DONALD TRUMP.

198
00:09:08,230 --> 00:09:09,700
REALLY?

199
00:09:09,700 --> 00:09:11,830
THAT'S WHAT YOU HAVE
SUCCUMBED TO?

200
00:09:11,830 --> 00:09:12,830
THAT'S WHAT YOU

201
00:09:12,830 --> 00:09:14,350
ARE DEGRADED TO?

202
00:09:14,350 --> 00:09:17,110
FINALLY ON THE
POLICY, WE HAVE TRIED THIS

203
00:09:17,110 --> 00:09:21,570
BEFORE WITH NORTH KOREA IN THE
1990S AND RECENTLY, BOTH TIMES

204
00:09:21,570 --> 00:09:24,460
WHEN TRUMP SAID IT WAS SO STUPID
TO TALK TO NORTH KOREA, THEY

205
00:09:24,460 --> 00:09:27,600
ALWAYS RENEGE ON DEALS, DON'T
TALK TO THEM -- NOW HE'S GOING

206
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:30,540
TO DO SOMETHING UNPRECEDENTED
AND GO MEET WITH THE NORTH

207
00:09:30,540 --> 00:09:31,890
KOREAN LEADER.

208
00:09:31,890 --> 00:09:35,520
BUT DESPITE ALL
THAT, I SAY YES.

209
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:36,520
I WANT NORTH

210
00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:40,070
AND SOUTH KOREA TO DO A PEACE
TREATY, AND NORTH KOREA PROMISES

211
00:09:40,070 --> 00:09:41,160
THEY ARE GOING TO DENUCLEARIZE.

212
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:42,380
DO I TRUST THEM?

213
00:09:42,380 --> 00:09:43,380
HELL NO.

214
00:09:43,380 --> 00:09:44,380
THEY

215
00:09:44,380 --> 00:09:45,380
RENEGE ON OTHER DEALS.

216
00:09:45,380 --> 00:09:46,820
BUT IF
YOU REMEMBER, WITH BUSH --

217
00:09:46,820 --> 00:09:53,170
THAT'S ONE OF THE THINGS I USED
TO GIVE BUSH CREDIT FOR, TWO

218
00:09:53,170 --> 00:09:57,780
THINGS, THE AMOUNT OF MONEY HE
GAVE TO FIGHT AIDS IN AFRICA,

219
00:09:57,780 --> 00:10:01,570
THAT WAS GREAT FOR BUSH, AND HE
DIDN'T GO TO WAR WITH NORTH

220
00:10:01,570 --> 00:10:04,370
KOREA.

221
00:10:04,370 --> 00:10:06,680
IF WE GO TO WAR WE KNOW
WHAT HAPPENS, MILLIONS DIED.

222
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:07,680
IF

223
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:10,990
WE KEEP DELAYING THERE IS SOME
CHANCE THAT WE CAN PEACEABLY

224
00:10:10,990 --> 00:10:14,780
REMOVE THE DICTATOR IN NORTH
KOREA AND THAT AWFUL GOVERNMENT.

225
00:10:14,780 --> 00:10:16,890
SO I LOVE THAT SOUTH AND NORTH
KOREA ARE TRYING TO GET INTO

226
00:10:16,890 --> 00:10:20,780
SOME SORT OF PEACE DEAL, IF
TRUMP IS IN FAVOR OF THAT,

227
00:10:20,780 --> 00:10:25,890
GREAT, WONDERFUL, NO MATTER HOW
RIDICULOUS HE IS AND HOW HE

228
00:10:25,890 --> 00:10:27,880
BLUNDERS HIS WAY INTO IT.

229
00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:30,220
WHAT
I'M AFRAID OF IS THAT SOMETHING

230
00:10:30,220 --> 00:10:34,460
WILL GO WRONG AND INSTEAD OF
KISSING HIS ASS SOMEONE IS GOING

231
00:10:34,460 --> 00:10:39,050
TO ACCIDENTALLY INSULT HIM WHEN
HE GOES TO MEET KIM JONG-UN, AND

232
00:10:39,050 --> 00:10:41,710
THEN HE'S GOING TO TRY TO PROVE
HE HAS A BIGGER BUTTON.

233
00:10:41,710 --> 00:10:43,570
>>THAT'S TERRIFYING.

234
00:10:43,570 --> 00:10:46,720
>>THESE ARE TERRIFYING TIMES.

235
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:47,860
IT COULD GO IN A POSITIVE

236
00:10:47,860 --> 00:10:51,350
DIRECTION AND IF IT DOES I WILL
GIVE HIM A LOT OF CREDIT, OR IT

237
00:10:51,350 --> 00:10:54,990
COULD GO IN A DISASTROUS
DIRECTION.

238
00:10:54,990 --> 00:00:00,000
SO, BRACE FOR IMPACT.
