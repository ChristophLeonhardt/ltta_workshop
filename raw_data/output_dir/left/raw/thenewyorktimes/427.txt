1
00:00:12,410 --> 00:00:16,370
We were soldiers doing what
we were instructed to do.

2
00:00:16,370 --> 00:00:19,640
This is Bruce Jessen, a
former military psychologist

3
00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:24,650
who became a CIA contractor, and
his colleague, James Mitchell.

4
00:00:24,650 --> 00:00:28,070
Any expertise in the
art of interview?

5
00:00:28,070 --> 00:00:30,110
My god, I'm a
clinical psychologist.

6
00:00:30,110 --> 00:00:31,700
Interviews are what we do.

7
00:00:31,700 --> 00:00:34,520
They've been described as the
architects of the extremely

8
00:00:34,520 --> 00:00:38,360
harsh interrogation program
used at secret CIA prisons

9
00:00:38,360 --> 00:00:39,340
after 9/11.

10
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:46,500
Jim and I went into
a cubicle, sat down.

11
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:47,910
He sat down at the typewriter.

12
00:00:47,910 --> 00:00:52,500
And together, we rolled
out and typed up the list

13
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:56,630
that I've seen in the documents
here that was submitted.

14
00:00:56,630 --> 00:00:58,650
They're now defendants
in a case brought

15
00:00:58,650 --> 00:01:01,590
by some of the men
tortured in those prisons--

16
00:01:01,590 --> 00:01:06,630
Suleiman Salim, Mohamed
Ben Soud, and Obaidullah,

17
00:01:06,630 --> 00:01:10,230
the nephew of Gul Rahman,
who died in custody.

18
00:01:10,230 --> 00:01:13,350
This is the first time that
Mitchell and Jessen are facing

19
00:01:13,350 --> 00:01:15,630
lawyers for former detainees.

20
00:01:15,630 --> 00:01:18,210
We exclusively obtained
video depositions

21
00:01:18,210 --> 00:01:19,620
from the case,
which is scheduled

22
00:01:19,620 --> 00:01:21,510
for trial in September.

23
00:01:21,510 --> 00:01:23,340
Watch throughout as
Mitchell and Jessen

24
00:01:23,340 --> 00:01:25,920
attempt to defend
themselves, both rhetorically

25
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:27,390
and emotionally.

26
00:01:27,390 --> 00:01:30,240
If I want to get
information from you, Dror,

27
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:31,990
I don't want to slap you.

28
00:01:31,990 --> 00:01:33,530
I don't want to wall you.

29
00:01:33,530 --> 00:01:37,570
I don't want to waterboard
you, even if you're my enemy.

30
00:01:37,570 --> 00:01:40,710
Jessen, who's never spoken
publicly about his role,

31
00:01:40,710 --> 00:01:43,260
at times appears to
wrestle with what happened,

32
00:01:43,260 --> 00:01:45,870
whereas Mitchell, who wrote
a book about his experiences,

33
00:01:45,870 --> 00:01:48,840
comes off as more
polished and assertive.

34
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:53,550
I disagree with the suggestion
that we were architects,

35
00:01:53,550 --> 00:02:00,090
because we weren't breaking
new ground in the sense that

36
00:02:00,090 --> 00:02:01,200
architects do.

37
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:03,240
Mitchell and Jessen
didn't directly

38
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:06,540
interrogate the two surviving
men who brought this case,

39
00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:08,130
but the methods
they proposed were

40
00:02:08,130 --> 00:02:11,550
used on them and at
least 37 other men.

41
00:02:11,550 --> 00:02:13,770
A fascinating aspect
of these videos

42
00:02:13,770 --> 00:02:16,830
is how their accounts of
enhanced interrogation

43
00:02:16,830 --> 00:02:20,100
dramatically differ from
what the detainees describe.

44
00:02:20,100 --> 00:02:24,510
I'm a pretty good judge of
what it's like to be walled.

45
00:02:24,510 --> 00:02:26,010
And--

46
00:02:26,010 --> 00:02:27,180
[NON-ENGLISH]

47
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:29,850
I remember also them
putting a cloth around--

48
00:02:29,850 --> 00:02:32,975
tying a cloth around
my neck, and then they

49
00:02:32,975 --> 00:02:35,490
are punching me on the wall.

50
00:02:35,490 --> 00:02:36,990
Oh, it's discombobulating.

51
00:02:36,990 --> 00:02:39,042
It's not painful.

52
00:02:39,042 --> 00:02:41,250
My guess would be that some
of the folks sitting here

53
00:02:41,250 --> 00:02:42,390
have been walled.

54
00:02:42,390 --> 00:02:44,070
It stirs up your inner ears.

55
00:02:44,070 --> 00:02:48,570
And it's like being on one of
those whirlygigs or something.

56
00:02:48,570 --> 00:02:50,310
You move around quite a bit.

57
00:02:50,310 --> 00:02:59,760
And in fact, if it's painful,
you're doing it wrong.

58
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:03,720
There is a tether anchored
to the ceiling in the center

59
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:06,570
of the detention cell.

60
00:03:06,570 --> 00:03:11,190
The detainee has
handcuffs, and they're

61
00:03:11,190 --> 00:03:16,380
attached to the tether in
a way that they can't lie

62
00:03:16,380 --> 00:03:18,420
down or rest against the wall.

63
00:03:22,180 --> 00:03:24,720
They're monitored to make sure
they don't get edema if they

64
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:28,230
hang on the cuffs too much.

65
00:03:28,230 --> 00:03:30,990
Holding so-called stress
positions for hours

66
00:03:30,990 --> 00:03:34,070
was another technique
used on detainees.

67
00:03:34,070 --> 00:03:38,690
I remember being tied on the
wall, handcuffed on the wall,

68
00:03:38,690 --> 00:03:41,640
and I couldn't go
up or come down.

69
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:44,610
This is Jose Rodriguez,
former head of the CIA's

70
00:03:44,610 --> 00:03:46,410
Counterterrorism Center.

71
00:03:46,410 --> 00:03:51,360
On "60 Minutes,"
where you analogized

72
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:57,220
the stress positions to
working out in a gym.

73
00:03:57,220 --> 00:03:59,640
Correct.

74
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:01,940
Do you think that's
a good analogy

75
00:04:01,940 --> 00:04:05,490
to the kind of discomfort that
the stress positions caused?

76
00:04:05,490 --> 00:04:07,547
I can only imagine.

77
00:04:07,547 --> 00:04:08,880
So you don't know is the answer.

78
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:09,421
I don't know.

79
00:04:12,510 --> 00:04:15,900
I can't describe
how painful it was.

80
00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:17,579
Do you presently
experience the pain?

81
00:04:22,060 --> 00:04:23,130
Yes.

82
00:04:23,130 --> 00:04:27,130
Can you describe for me the
pain that you feel presently?

83
00:04:27,130 --> 00:04:28,140
[NON-ENGLISH]

84
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:37,445
Maybe I'll need to tie
you here for one hour

85
00:04:37,445 --> 00:04:40,130
so you can feel the pain if
you want to know the pain.

86
00:04:43,532 --> 00:04:44,460
We can take a break.

87
00:04:44,460 --> 00:04:46,500
We can take a break.

88
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:48,240
In this next section,
we hear Mitchell

89
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:51,870
talk in almost casual terms
about simulated drowning,

90
00:04:51,870 --> 00:04:54,360
which the U.S. had long
considered torture.

91
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:56,010
The plaintiffs in
this case were not

92
00:04:56,010 --> 00:04:58,960
subjected to this technique,
but other detainees were.

93
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:01,310
You thought waterboarding
was a bad thing,

94
00:05:01,310 --> 00:05:03,840
was a painful thing, right?

95
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:05,611
No, I thought it
could be done safely.

96
00:05:05,611 --> 00:05:07,110
I thought he would
be uncomfortable.

97
00:05:07,110 --> 00:05:09,150
It sucks.

98
00:05:09,150 --> 00:05:11,740
I don't know that it's painful.

99
00:05:11,740 --> 00:05:13,680
But it's distressing.

100
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:16,495
I saw an interview with you
where you said between somebody

101
00:05:16,495 --> 00:05:18,620
breaking their leg and
somebody being waterboarded,

102
00:05:18,620 --> 00:05:20,703
most people would choose
to have their leg broken.

103
00:05:20,703 --> 00:05:22,750
Do you remember saying
that in an interview?

104
00:05:22,750 --> 00:05:23,250
No.

105
00:05:29,270 --> 00:05:30,880
OK.

106
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:32,570
Now, you're using
the word "painful."

107
00:05:32,570 --> 00:05:34,570
I'm using the word
"distressing."

108
00:05:34,570 --> 00:05:39,490
The two things are not
synonymous in my mind.

109
00:05:39,490 --> 00:05:42,010
The pressure is designed
to be used in a way

110
00:05:42,010 --> 00:05:45,550
that it doesn't harm, but it
makes someone uncomfortable.

111
00:05:45,550 --> 00:05:51,890
And they're more
irritating than painful.

112
00:05:51,890 --> 00:05:54,530
This entire case, really,
gets to the question

113
00:05:54,530 --> 00:05:57,830
of personal responsibility
within a larger system.

114
00:05:57,830 --> 00:05:59,450
If you feel the
government is pressing

115
00:05:59,450 --> 00:06:03,450
you to cross boundaries, to
what extent should you resist?

116
00:06:03,450 --> 00:06:07,100
We also didn't want
to use waterboarding.

117
00:06:07,100 --> 00:06:10,400
We ended up in a
video conference

118
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:13,370
with Jose Rodriguez
and a bunch of folks.

119
00:06:13,370 --> 00:06:17,300
And prior to that,
Bruce and I had

120
00:06:17,300 --> 00:06:20,090
said we're not going
to continue doing this.

121
00:06:20,090 --> 00:06:24,350
And what they said was, well,
you guys have lost your spine.

122
00:06:24,350 --> 00:06:26,480
They kept telling me every
day a nuclear bomb was

123
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:28,670
going to be exploded
in the United States,

124
00:06:28,670 --> 00:06:31,420
and that because I told him
to stop, I had lost my nerve,

125
00:06:31,420 --> 00:06:34,490
and it was going to be my
fault if I didn't continue.

126
00:06:34,490 --> 00:06:37,160
I think the word that
was actually used

127
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:38,720
is that you guys are pussies.

128
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:41,150
There's going to be
another attack in America,

129
00:06:41,150 --> 00:06:44,030
and the blood of dead civilians
is going to be on your hands.

130
00:06:44,030 --> 00:06:45,700
If you won't follow
through with this,

131
00:06:45,700 --> 00:06:48,740
then we're going to send
somebody out there who will.

132
00:06:48,740 --> 00:06:51,680
Because we worked for them,
and they wanted it continued.

133
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:54,770
Justice Department lawyers
approved the techniques.

134
00:06:54,770 --> 00:06:57,680
Based in part on what
Mitchell and Jessen told them,

135
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:59,240
they concluded
that the techniques

136
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:01,244
would cause no lasting harm.

137
00:07:01,244 --> 00:07:02,660
And by their
reasoning, that meant

138
00:07:02,660 --> 00:07:04,910
they wouldn't amount to torture.

139
00:07:04,910 --> 00:07:07,400
Do you think that the enhanced
interrogation techniques

140
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:08,890
could result in long-term harm?

141
00:07:08,890 --> 00:07:09,390
No.

142
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:11,980
Why is that?

143
00:07:15,220 --> 00:07:17,120
It never did.

144
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:18,980
I don't know that for a fact.

145
00:07:18,980 --> 00:07:21,580
It's one of those things
that you can establish.

146
00:07:21,580 --> 00:07:23,510
If they're out there
and that happened,

147
00:07:23,510 --> 00:07:27,500
then show me the data.

148
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:31,520
I think none of the
men that I was involved

149
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:37,070
with while I was involved
with them experienced anything

150
00:07:37,070 --> 00:07:39,220
that would have led to that.

151
00:07:39,220 --> 00:07:42,410
I'm very convinced of that.

152
00:07:42,410 --> 00:07:47,810
Have you suffered any
psychological injuries

153
00:07:47,810 --> 00:07:50,310
as a result of your
captivity in Cobalt?

154
00:07:53,782 --> 00:07:55,270
Of course.

155
00:07:55,270 --> 00:07:56,262
What are they?

156
00:08:01,490 --> 00:08:03,230
Nightmares.

157
00:08:03,230 --> 00:08:06,108
Can you tell me about
these nightmares?

158
00:08:06,108 --> 00:08:09,080
[NON-ENGLISH]

159
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:14,930
It comes to me during my
sleep, and as if I'm still

160
00:08:14,930 --> 00:08:23,120
in prison in that horrible
place and shackled.

161
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:24,890
In addition to
recurring nightmares,

162
00:08:24,890 --> 00:08:29,090
Mr. Ben Soud describes feelings
of anxiety, fear, and worry.

163
00:08:29,090 --> 00:08:31,760
Salim also describes
ongoing effects.

164
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:36,350
When asked about his feelings
of isolation, he responds--

165
00:08:36,350 --> 00:08:40,010
I don't feel like
being with people.

166
00:08:40,010 --> 00:08:41,510
I like being by myself.

167
00:08:41,510 --> 00:08:46,340
And I don't like walking
around to see people.

168
00:08:46,340 --> 00:08:49,608
I feel like I'm so weakened,
I can't do anything.

169
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:54,310
Mitchell and Jessen
continued working

170
00:08:54,310 --> 00:08:56,260
with the CIA for many years.

171
00:08:56,260 --> 00:08:57,940
They set up a
contracting company,

172
00:08:57,940 --> 00:09:00,820
and ultimately, they ran
many aspects of the CIA's

173
00:09:00,820 --> 00:09:02,590
interrogation program.

174
00:09:02,590 --> 00:09:07,015
For that work, their company
received $81 million.

175
00:09:07,015 --> 00:09:09,640
In the end, whether or
