MORE TALKS WITH NORTH KOREA, AND THEN SOME. CHRIS. Chris: THANK YOU, GREG. NOW LET'S GET REACTION TO THE SUMMIT FROM REPUBLICAN SENATOR TOM COTTON OF ARKANSAS. THE IRAQ WAR VETERAN IS A MEMBER OF THE SENATE ARMED SERVICES' COMMITTEE AND HE JOINS US FROM CAPITOL HILL. SENATOR, FROM THE VERY START YOU HAVE BEEN IN YOUR OWN WORDS DEEPLY SKEPTICAL OF NORTH KOREA'S INTENTIONS. NOW THAT IT'S OVER, WHAT YOU THINK OF THE SUMMIT AND THE AGREEMENT THAT PRESIDENT TRUMP AND KIM JONG UN SIGNED? CHRIS, FIRST, THANKS FOR HAVING ME ON TO DISCUSS THIS INCREDIBLE DAY. I THINK THIS WAS AN IMPORTANT FIRST STEP BUT WE HAVE TO REMEMBER IT WAS ONLY A FIRST STEP. I AM SKEPTICAL OF KIM JONG UN'S COMMITMENT TO DENUCLEARIZING NORTH KOREA. I KNOW SECRETARY POMPEO HAS ARTIE LEFT FOR SOUTH KOREA AND THEN HE WILL BE IN CHINA TOMORROW. NOW IT'S TIME TO NEGOTIATE THE NITTY-GRITTY DETAILS OF VERIFIABLY AND IRREVERSIBLY THE NUCLEAR RISING NORTH KOREA PRESIDENT TRUMP HIMSELF SAID, IT MAY NOT WORK OUT BUT THEY HAD TO SIT DOWN AND HAVE DISAGREEMENT FACE-TO-FACE BEFORE WE COULD MOVE ONTO THE NEXT STAGE OF OUR NEGOTIATIONS. Chris: IN THE AGREEMENT, KIM COMMITS TO "THE COMPLETE DENUCLEARIZATION OF THE KOREAN PENINSULA." WE WILL HAVE TO WAIT AND SEE WHAT HE DOES IN TERMS OF NORTH KOREA, BUT ARE YOU CONCERNED THAT HE IS DEMANDING THAT ON OUR SIDE WE FOLD THE NUCLEAR UMBRELLA WE HAVE HAD FOR DECADES PROTECTING SOUTH KOREA AND JAPAN. NO, I'M NOT CONCERNED THAT THE PRESIDENT WOULD WITHDRAW THAT UMBRELLA FROM ANY OF OUR ALLIES. KIM JONG UN HOLDS THE ONLY NUCLEAR WEAPONS THAT ARE ON THE PENINSULA AND THAT IS ONE THING THAT IS SUCH A THREAT NOT ONLY TO SOUTH KOREA AND JAPAN AND THE AMERICAN CITIZENS, BUT TO THE UNITED STATES NOW THAT KIM JONG UN HAS MISSILES THAT CAN REACH THE UNITED STATES. PART OF THE LONG-STANDING AMERICAN POLICY IS THAT WE HAVE A NUCLEAR ARSENAL PART TO PROTECT OURSELVES AND OUR ALLIES SO THEY DON'T FEEL THE NEED TO OBTAIN NUCLEAR WEAPONS. I FEAR THAT SOUTH KOREA AND JAPAN AND TAIWAN WOULD WANT TO OBTAIN NUCLEAR WEAPONS IF WE WEREN'T WORKING TOWARDS THE DENUCLEARIZATION OF NORTH KOREA. Chris: THOUGHT, SENATOR, AS PRESIDENT TRUMP ANNOUNCED THAT HE IS GOING TO END JOINT U.S. MILITARY EXERCISES WITH SOUTH KOREA. DO YOU THINK THAT'S A GOOD IDEA? THE PRESIDENT SAID THEY WERE PAUSING THEM FOR THE TIME BEING. WE JUST HAD THE BIGGEST SINGLE EXERCISE EACH YEAR OCCURS IN THE SPRING THAT PROBABLY WON'T HAPPEN FOR ANOTHER NINE OR TEN MONTHS UNTIL THE SPRING OF 2019. I THINK WE WILL HAVE A PRETTY GOOD READ ON WHETHER KIM JONG UN IS GOING TO KEEP HIS COMMITMENT UNTIL THEN. SAID HE WAS AWARE OF THE SUSPENSION AND HE SUPPORTS THE DECISION. REGULAR, EVERYDAY TRAINING EXERCISES WILL OCCUR. SECRETARY MATTIS WOULDN'T HAVE SUPPORTED THE DECISION IF YOU WEREN'T CONFIDENT THAT OUR TROOPS WOULD BE FULLY READY TO DEFEND OUR INTEREST ON THE KOREAN PENINSULA. Chris: PRESIDENT TRUMP SAYS THAT HE MAY START EASING SANCTIONS ON NORTH KOREA, EVEN BEFORE IT ENDS ITS ENTIRE NUCLEAR PROGRAM, COMPLETELY DENUCLEARIZE, OFFERING THIS EXPLANATION. TAKE A LOOK. I THINK WE WILL DO IT AS FAST AS IT CAN BE DONE SCIENTIFICALLY. AS FAST AS I CAN BE DONE MECHANICALLY. I DON'T THINK I MEAN, I'VE READ HORROR STORIES, IT'S A 15 YEAR PROCESS. ASSUMING YOU WANTED TO DO IT QUICKLY, I DON'T BELIEVE THAT. I THINK WHOEVER WROTE THAT IS WRONG. BUT THERE WILL BE A POINT AT WHICH WHEN YOU ARE 20% THROUGH YOU CAN'T GO BACK. Chris: AS A MEMBER OF THE SENATE ARMED SERVICES' COMMITTEE, CAN YOU EXPLAIN WHAT THAT MEANS WHEN YOU ARE 20% THROUGH YOU CAN'T GO BACK? I DON'T THINK THAT WE SHOULD RELAX SANCTIONS IN ANY WAY UNTIL WE ARE FAR DOWN THE PATH IF NOT AT THE END OF THE ROAD OF NORTH KOREA'S DENUCLEARIZATION. I THINK THE PRESIDENT WAS USING THAT NUMBER AS AN EXAMPLE. HE WILL HAVE TO OPEN HIS COUNTRY TO WEAPONS INSPECTORS. HE WILL NEED TO MAKE A COMPLETE DECLARATION OF HIS NUCLEAR PROGRAM AND THEY WILL NEED TO DEVELOP STEPS TO REMOVE THOSE NUCLEAR MATERIALS AND CERTIFIED AND DENUCLEARIZE. THE PRESIDENT IS RIGHT THAT ONCE YOU GET FAR ENOUGH DOWN THAT ROAD IT WOULD BE VERY HARD TO REVERSE THOSE STEPS. WE SHOULD NOT RELAX SANCTIONS UP FRONT. THAT'S ONE REASON WHY I WAS OPPOSED TO DEAL WITH IRAN, BECAUSE WE WERE RELAXING SANCTIONS, GIVING CONCESSIONS ON THE FRONT END FOR AN EASILY REVERSED PROMISES AS OPPOSED TO GETTING CONCRETE ACTION FROM OUR ADVERSARY AND THEN TAKING ACTION INTO THAT PROCESS. Chris: IN THE MEANTIME, THE PRESIDENT SAYS THAT HE IS GOING TO MAINTAIN HIS SANCTIONS REGIME, ALTHOUGH HE'S NOT GOING TO CALL IT MAXIMUM PRESSURE ANYMORE, BUT HE DID SAY THAT SINCE THE NEGOTIATIONS HAD STARTED, CHINA HAS EASED UP ON SOME OF ITS TIGHT CONTROLS ON ACTIVITY ACROSS THE BORDER. IT SEEMS THAT SOUTH KOREA IS ANXIOUS TO BEGIN TRADE WITH NORTH KOREA AND THE QUESTION I HAVE IS HAS BY NORMALIZING THINGS, APPEARING HERE, MEETING WITH PRESIDENT MOON OF SOUTH KOREA, MEETING WITH CHINA, AS KIM JONG UN ALREADY SUCCEEDED TO SOME DEGREE IN WEAKENING THE MAXIMUM PRESSURE CAMPAIGN? NOT NECESSARILY BY THE UNITED STATES, BUT BY THE REST OF THE WORLD? NO, I DON'T THINK HE HAS. CHINA HAS ALWAYS DISPLAYED A DOUBLE GAME WHEN IT COMES TO NORTH KOREA ON THE ONE HAND SAYING THEY WANT TO DENUCLEARIZE NORTH KOREA BUT ON THE OTHER HAND PROPPING UP THE REGIME ECONOMICALLY, FINANCIALLY AND POLITICALLY. THEY REALLY ONLY CAME TO THE TABLE OVER THE LAST 18 MONTHS BECAUSE OF THE PRESIDENT'S APPROACH SINCE LAST JANUARY. THE SOUTH KOREAN ADMINISTRATION THAT TOOK OFFICE EARLIER THIS YEAR SIMPLY HAD A DIFFERENT APPROACH THAN PREVIOUS ADMINISTRATIONS. THE PRESIDENT HAS DONE A GOOD JOB OF DEVELOPING A RAPPORT WITH PRESIDENT MOON OF SOUTH KOREA AND TRYING TO KEEP A CLOSE ALLIANCE STRUCTURE BETWEEN SOUTH KOREA, JAPAN AND THE UNITED STATES TO ENSURE THAT THAT PRESSURE CAMPAIGN CONTINUES. THE PRESIDENT MAY NOT WANT TO SAY IT AFTER THE SUMMER, I WILL SAY IT, WE NEED TO CONTINUE MAXIMUM PRESSURE ON NORTH KOREA UNTIL THEY DENUCLEARIZE. Chris: FINALLY, PRESIDENT TRUMP HAD A NUMBER OF VERY OPTIMISTIC THINGS TO SAY ABOUT WHERE THINGS STAND NOW WITH NORTH KOREA. HERE ARE A FEW CLIPS. IT'S A VERY GREAT DAY, IT'S A VERY GREAT MOMENT IN THE HISTORY OF THE WORLD. I HAVE I THINK A VERY GOOD RELATIONSHIP WITH CHAIRMAN KIM RIGHT NOW. I REALLY DO. YOU CAN'T ENSURE ANYTHING. ALL I CAN SAY IS THEY WANT TO MAKE A DEAL. Chris: SENATOR, DO YOU SHARE PRESIDENT TRUMP'S OPTIMISM? WE SPLIT UP CERTAINLY BROKEN OUT OF THE RUT OF 25 YEARS OF FAILED U.S. POLICY TOWARDS NORTH KOREA. I DON'T KNOW IF KIM JONG UN IS GOING TO KEEP HIS COMMITMENTS WERE NOT THE PRESIDENT HAS SPENT HOURS WITH HIM NOW AND VERY FEW OF US HAVE THE BENEFIT OF THAT EXPERIENCE. I HOPE THE PRESIDENT IS RIGHT. BUT BECAUSE THE KIM REGIME, BOTH KIM JONG UN AND HIS FATHER AND HIS GRANDFATHER HAD A LONG HISTORY OF DUPLICITY. WE NEED TO CONTINUE OUR PRESSURE CAMPAIGN, WE NEED TO HOLD KIM JONG UN TO HIS COMMITMENTS. I THINK WE WILL FIND OUT IN A MATTER OF MONTHS WHETHER HE'S
