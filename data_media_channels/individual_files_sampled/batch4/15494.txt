firing a deputy director of the FBI that's big news that would be big news in any country regarding its federal police force but ironically Andrew McCabe is only a small part of the problem it's good the decision was taken it should have been taken earlier this is a man who was number two at the bureau who has found to have lied to federal investigators and also to leaked to the media and was behind the authorization of the application to spy on a member of the Trump campaign an application that led to that individual's surveillance by the intelligence community but the problem is much bigger than one man we now know if you look at all the names that have been covered in the well not the mainstream media but other media we know that there are at least a dozen individuals at the Department of Justice at the FBI or implicated in FISA gate and also server Gate with regards to how Hillary Clinton was exonerated from having top-secret information on a private server now what is to be done attorney General Sessions must take action to re-instill confidence in the FBI in the Department of Justice across the United States the FBI perhaps the most prestigious law enforcement organization in the world has been undermined its reputation dashed but just a handful of people we must have new investigations by people who do not come from the swamp who aren't part of the Washington Network we need to have people put together from field offices around the United States to get to the bottom of the political exploitation of the federal government for it for the purposes of a political campaign this will take time but it must be done sooner AG sessions gets work creating that task force the sooner that the FBI's reputation and the Department of Justice's can be rebuilt but it will take years to do so but there's even a more significant issue at hand for years we've been listening to individuals attack the Conservatives for their attitudes on national security well now we have a very serious national security issue Vladimir Putin was involved in a low-level way through his minions in the presidential election not in the way the left would have you believe in colluding with the Trump campaign but by causing mayhem buying advertisements on Facebook and by basically being a disruptive force at a low level on both sides of the campaign however he was very much interested in seeing our reputation as a nation undermined and he must be very very happy right now because there is an impression that if your last name is Clinton you get a pass you're protected members of the Obama administration will protect you even when you commit crimes that damages our reputation across the globe for decades the Russians have said American democracy is a chimera it's an illusion we're really not the nation we said we were we cannot allow a handful of people inside the last administration who are now holdovers in the Trump administration to give that impression any validity at the end of the day the political hacks who are part of this conspiracy to undermine a democratic election actually played into the hands of one of our very very old adversaries we need to recover that as much as we can as quickly as we can and that will only be done by making sure that the people who committed crimes for political reasons are brought to justice thank you for watching the Gawker briefing if you like this video please check out the rebel media YouTube channel follow me on Twitter at said Gawker that's s e be g RK a and share these videos on Facebook and Twitter because with your help we can push back on the fake news industrial complex and finally get the truth out god bless
