hi I'm Max Keiser hey you know what a Rube Goldberg machine is right it's like a mousetrap with like 15 different ways to get the ball through the hoop down the slide over to the roundabout and then down so top Donald Trump yes Stacy that was a Rube Goldberg opening nobody knows quite what you said but I'm gonna start with the Donald Trump tweet and nobody ever knows quite what he's saying either and that is President Xi of China and I are working together to give massive Chinese phone companies ZTE a way to get back into business fast too many jobs in China lost Commerce Department has been instructed to get it done this is a story highlighting the capricious nature of a US dollar empire remember we've had this exorbitant privilege for the last what 40 years since 1971 since we went off the gold standard we've had this exorbitant privilege as Charles de Gaulle's government pointed out that we were able to basically print money and get free goods from the rest of the world and this worked out quite well for a very long time and led to globalization and rise in global living standards and now it feels like once we erected one trade barrier one basically barrier by a swift to this financial this dollar financial system a few years ago against Iran and at that time our guest Jim Rickards said be careful what you do because if you use this weapon too often things could fall apart but this story about ZTE what happened to ZTE a massive Chinese telecoms company that got destroyed overnight by the US and now is trying they're trying to resurrect it is an interesting one right well you know Trump said that China's taking our jobs so here he is very near to having just been elected and he's making sure that China gets our jobs he's exporting our jobs back to China he took him back we know he's putting him back he's like so it is like a Rube Goldberg machine in that sense and it also reminds me what happens when you have a global economy that's completely tied together just-in-time delivery like a Gordian knot of trade if you try to move one little part with a sanction or tweak here it affects the entire ecosystem of all global trade but it's not like we're living in the 18th century or something where you put something on a ship and it takes a few weeks to get to the other side and no we're gonna settle that trade in gold no it's all instantaneous especially with blockchain coming into the mix it's instantaneously settled upon the execution of the trade it's instant settlement no banks even so Trump is like wallowing in there like a drunken Boris Yeltsin and like trying to figure out like well he's like completely bamboozling himself he's fooling himself and it also reminds me in the UK when they have the transportation system set up in different divisions so that the one companies doing the railway another company is doing the stops along the railway and they're competing with each other can the UK privatize these components of their transportation system so then they compete with each other and it doesn't work you can't get from point A to point B because there's two separate companies or five separate companies competing with each other to stop you from getting to your destination so you end up with hey our railway system is broken well here Trump's applying the same for cocktail logic to global trade and looking like of course here's a US dollar based trade system that has benefited us immensely yes we have lost a lot of jobs but we've gotten we receive a lot of goods for free he I'm gonna show you the consequences of imposing sanctions like they did on ZTE first I'll tell you about ZTE Chinese tech giant on brink of collapse in the US cold war this is from the New York Times when a China's most internationally successful tech suppliers with about 17 billion dollars in annual revenue ZTE is facing a death sentence the Commerce Department has blocked his access to American made components until 2025 saying the company failed to punish employees who violated trade controls against Iran and North Korea so they had already paid a billion dollar fine then they said they can't treat use any u.s. parts many of their components for their various products that they make are actually from the United States so basically they had to shut down fire 75,000 people around the world and 17 billion dollars from the global trade system evaporated but the point is that because of this as the New York Times points out as the Trump administration threatens a trade war to stymie China's plans for promoting events industries the firm's travails are proving an apt demonstration for China's leaders of exactly why the country needs to be more self-sufficient in technology Chris Lane a telecom analyst in Hong Kong with Sanford C Bernstein believes that china now has the resolve to whip its semiconductor business into world-leading shape even if it takes a decade to do so quote they're going to pour billions of dollars into preventing this from ever happening again he said in the long run strategically this might be worse for the US than the current situation so he's gonna force China into the arms of Iran was forcing Germany into the arms of Russia so he's creating a multipolar world which means a multi currency world which means blockchain Bitcoin world the biggest loser is the US dollar in America yeah in this case of course the US corporations have benefited from the semiconductor business that ZTE needs microchips from here so it's it's helped us manufacturers the US companies US employees now he's forcing ZTE out of business or he's trying to bring them back into business but he was he forced them out of business because you couldn't use us parts but remember there are many many other nations in the world and they all look at this and say well is there kind of going to be a point where we're gonna suddenly be cut off should we build our own manufacturing system to rely on any US components when it's it's quite possible that Trump or whoever comes becomes president knacks could do the same thing right you know what that is that's inflationary because up until now we've had this huge deflationary wave of globalization and the US dollar is a single source of borrowing which is then tied to the yen and you can get money for negative R interest rates but if everyone splits off into their own separate fiefdoms and they're gonna rebuild and replicate everyone's manufacturing capacity in five or six different countries that's frickin inflationary that means that the US dollar bond market the US Treasury market now 3% the highest it's been in years is going to 5 or 6 percent that means every mortgage America is going to go out of business Deutsche Bank a new report it's going out of business it's insolvent that'll set off another 2008 firestorm of global banking collapses it's happening now where's that money going to go Bitcoin about that Iran sanctions story this was another story that happened capriciously like with that it was so like the the the kings of england before the magna carta like it was very whimsical and like I'm gonna behead that enemy of mine I'm gonna be head my cousin because he insulted me at at you know Thanksgiving dinner but Thanksgiving dinner your house having like a burnt turkey breast but here at beheaded but here is another article about the consequences of using that sort of power of pulling the trigger on the power that you have to cut people off from the US dollar system time to break free from America this is from a blog called irrationality and you know Airbus has 10 percent of their components are made in the US so just ten percent of their components but because of that because Trump after all those years of negotiations and their Iranian deal and he decided to add a whim via tweet to just knock off that system and Europe has billions of dollars of new trade with Iran Airbus has a billions of dollars deal so suddenly Airbus can't do this then look at the consequences these are things said by French and German ministers french foreign minister jean-yves le drian complained that quote we feel that the extraterritoriality of their american sanctioned measures are unacceptable the europeans should not have to pay for the withdrawal from an agreement by the united states which they had themselves contributed meanwhile french finance minister bruno de mer asked yesterday do we want to be vassals who obeyed decisions taken by the united states while clinging to the hem of their trousers or do we want to say we have our own economic interests and remarkably the article goes on to point out that because of these Iranian sanctions they're actually discussing very high levels in Europe among the Ministerial class of devising an alternative to the Swift system this is really important to the demise if the fewer dollars you have circulating the fewer the less power you have to mess up the system and destroy your enemies by cutting them off from message right the system is censorship enabling right if the US doesn't like a stealing Asajj they can cut them off from all credit if the US doesn't like what's happening around they can cut them off from Swift right that's censorship enabling that goes against everything that you would normally believe is the story with free trade so America is on a free trade country it's not a capitalist country it's not believing in competition it's a monopolist country that believes in monopolization and they like to use the dollar as their bludgeon to beat people into submission and if you try to get out of the dollar whether it's Syria Iraq Libya or Iran that just actually said they're getting out of the dollar to go to Euro you get bum bum bum bum why cuz it's dollars collateralized by violence ultraviolence I believe it was under Obama actually that they first cut off somebody from the Swift system and again it was it was Jim Rickards who has done extensive writing and research about the dollar and gold and STRs and he said that was the we could rule that day that we we did that because yeah we we were like yeah we won that battle but we could leave Jim record to Toshi Nakamoto well the truth as they point out European politicians are now considering what measures they can take to protect themselves from American efforts to force them to comply with American sanctions policy according to Demara the EU is considering various avenues one of these he says involves looking at Europe's financial independence what can we do to give Europe more financial tools allowing it to be independent from the United States connected with this as a proposal to set up a purely European finance house to oversee euro denominated transactions with Iran and again that guy is the French finance minister in Euro denominator transactions in Iran call up Tony Clippy at bitpay and you can do bitcoins transactions with Iran between Germany and Europe all day long for zero percent transaction fees and no restrictions whatsoever get with the 21st century Germany don't let America take course but rid of all the troops by the way Germany that's a huge strain on your economy you don't need the US troops in frickin Berlin or ever get rid of them so I mean interestingly this system that we have now this Swift US dollar based system was basically set up because of the French finance minister de Gaulle called the the fact that America had this gold standard and yet a dollar standard as well on top of it that they had an exorbitant privilege and they called back the 300 million dollars worth of gold and that set off in motion the the ending of the Bretton Woods Agreement so here they are calling again they're pointing out like hey this where it's subject to these crazy there's a gall moment it's another de Gaulle moment and quickly in the last headline here this is from Reuters and they're talking about again these Iran sanctions and the consequences and that is Iran oil sanctions could advance China's petrol um this is from Reuters not from us China is positioned to be a chief beneficiary of the u.s. decision to withdraw from the Iran nuclear deal as it would give China leverage to demand oil imports be priced in un several currency experts said on Thursday so just just as invading Iraq and spending lord knows how many trillions of dollars killing lord knows how many hundreds of thousands because we're not allowed to audit how much we spent we're not allowed to audit how many we killed but the fact is it benefited Iran here again we're gonna benefit China it's like a blundering Empire not that it's unique to the US every Empire does the same thing they all become hubristic and think they can bully everybody Rome did it Spain did it Britain did it everybody thinks they could do this and it this is never different it's always the same yes always history repeats or rhymes or whatever well we got a lot more crazy stuff coming in the second half so don't go away stay right there welcome back to the consu report I'm Max Keiser time now to turn to Gabriel Abed he's the co-founder and CEO of bit a Barbados based crypto fin tech company making waves in the Caribbean Gabriel welcome hi max thank you for having me on the show it's great to have you on the show because we get to travel around the world and find out what's happening in crypto in different places and Barbados has suddenly become a hot spot in crypto tell us why Barbados is seeing a lot of uplift from foreign companies coming in and setting up on our shores for tax optimization purposes beautiful beaches stable relatively stable economy but it's actually it's actually Bermuda right now that's starting to starting to become the the mover and shaker in the Pine Caribbean as a matter of fact to be quite honest it's the entire Caribbean starting to bubble you're starting to see st. Lucia Anguilla Antigua many islands are starting to to rise up towards and having appreciation towards this technology because of the value incentives that it offers there are other territories competing to be a go-to destination for the crypto industry obviously in Puerto Rico they're making a big play for this and in Singapore there's a lot of activity and hotspots in Europe so in the Caribbean now you mentioned that there are tax advantages as there would be in Ireland for example Ireland attracts a lot of companies for the tax advantage and the beautiful beaches and I understand that even the government in these areas are becoming quite Pro crypto correct yes so just to correct something that we said I'm I'm definitely the founder a bit one of the founders I'm no longer CEO I would be focusing now on more working with various central banks around the world so that while you're wearing the camo because you're now the armed wing community taking on the banks and hand-to-hand combat well actually this is a gift from a friend and I were all white so so it wasn't good for the cameras so oh I see that's the cover story I don't really believe it I know that some shenanigans going on but tell us more continue don't mean to interrupt well you know in the shenanigans a lot of follies been happening in the Caribbean region I mean it's the reason why we built bit was to start allowing the region to have more of a unified currency based system or a financial sector right now we're talking about a nation that's plagued with multiple currencies high remittance costs high settlement times high unbanked population the underbanked and in the region is actually quite upsetting all right you recently presented a speech to the bermuda monetary authorities on central bank digital dollars tell us about that typically when you introduce central bank digital currencies to central bankers it goes quite over their head initially so a big part of the process a bit is to educate central banks on the importance of this technology and what it can do for them from a perception of the senior age the cash optimization from cash creation the point of where central banks yes in the inflationary world print money and that actual printing of money has both of costs and a resource based cost and economic costs of course it also misses out some of the key points that we want as citizens which is accountability and transparency and so you start to educate these guys that blockchain and Bitcoin isn't a scary monster it's something that you can wrap your head around as a matter of fact central banks can embrace it to build a parallel to that world so that you can actually start transitioning into the modern age of technology how does that dialog going he opened excellent excellent we pit comms been successful with a few central banks in the region most specifically the Eastern Caribbean Central Bank and why that's important marks is because Eastern Caribbean Central Bank is a currency union of eight islands so that one central bank being a pilot and test zone for a central bank digital currency allows for islands to settle in between themselves another thing that you may not know right inter-island settlement yes made facilitated by blockchain facilitate not had before I guess with that kind of efficiency so you're an archipelago I believe is the phrase that would work in this case a group of islands yes and so uniquely you need to have the blockchain kind of clearing trades in these different territory and previously they would have gone through other jurisdictions to do these clearing trades right so that's a huge benefit so they they see cost advantages moat nation sauce advantages time advantages economic uplift GDP growth eunbong citizens can now become banked because penetration rates of smartphones are over a hundred percent in some of the islands so now stable coin is what you're talking about right yes so the stable coin is a subset of the whole crypto space yes and it's the idea that you know we've got tether tether is a is a dollar surrogate if you will that's crypto and that that's kind of a stable coin yes so tell us about that a little bit explore them well this provides facilitation to avoid volatility for those that wish to have the advantages of sending and receiving digital dollar without what could be perceived as a disadvantage and the in the crypto space of the volatility so what a stable coin accomplishes is the ability to transact digital fee ads and are you bringing in a new stable coin the stable coin well bit itself as a company but they produce stable coins for governments they provide government's to tools to produce their own stable coin and Barbados is an example the Barbadian digital dollar it's nothing more than the Barbados dollar backed one-to-one by the barbells dollar but just digital that's a blockchain unit unlike ripple I would guess there's no big tree mine there's zero pre mine there's not possible the pre mine happens at Central by they mean that's a central bank is kind of like able to perform as a central bank but in this crypto space the entire archipelago absolutely and you guys have been are facilitating that and they serve both worlds marks it serves the the the old world of central bank's as it lets them have a bridge into crypto and it serves the crypto world because it allows them to have the bridge into the traditional network because you can't take cash and convert cash physical dollars easy to Bitcoin or other forms of mathematical programmable see but in the world of central bank total dollars there's a direct bridge and a communicational path that can be built alright fair enough now you facilitated a relationship with B Nance the one year old crypto currency exchange already raking in billions why Bermuda Bermuda offered regulatory clarity and for and I don't want to speak on behalf of Finance because it's not my company although I have a lot of respect for the CEO when Bermuda when the premier Bermuda made good on his promises to let me get this straight finance is moving into Bermuda the finance doesn't have a single headquarters as CC the CEO would have explained it by announce exists in many parts of the world with different types of services in different parts of the world they're looking to do what I believe is compliance and Bermuda which Bermuda has a lot of compliance officers a very large set of compliance officers so it's quite ideal for them from that perspective does that bring in more I guess volume and business so it's a good unit brings in jobs it brings an economic growth it puts them on the map and right a fact the year mentioning it shows that there have become a little bit more no I'm looking to get it all paid vacation well no actually I shouldn't say that I get maybe maybe a bathing suit I think that would fall under the you know the threshold of what would be reasonable in this situation and maybe hook me up with a speedo flag on the speedo I told you I mentioned earlier I'm excellent anyway let's move on Charlie Munger accuses you as a crypto currency trader are a demented who harvest baby brains how do you respond what we're changing the world so if that makes us demented we're changing the world for the better and these guys have had a chance to do it and they did nothing that's to choose from true facts they've had decades to change the world and to make a difference right so Charlie Munger for context he is the partner of Warren Buffett over there I'm aware of his statements and you know he and Warren have been bad-mouthing crypto and their own and Bill Gates was there as well which and Bill Gates was is a hero of mine and you know considering some of the things that he wrote back in 95 along the lines of digital currencies will help the unbanked agents and we're literally helping unbanked nation unbanked nations in the Caribbean and around the world with other central banks towards his exact mission of being able to solve people's problems right and Bill Gates is a twice-convicted predatory monopolist I'm not sure he's got a moral you know soap box on which to stand and lecture folks these guys they've made their way in this world and they've done well and but they're definitely wrong they're more than wrong the mathematics in this system is pure and it's good and and at the end of the day the consensus is is amongst all of us well clearly there's some screwless in that group because they said that oh they would short it if they could and yeah it's easy to short Bitcoin there's plenty ample right ways to short Bitcoin so they haven't even spent five minutes doing any research Nouriel Roubini makes comments about it obviously never looking at anything to do with the white paper paul krugman looks at this and he's famously said the internet would be as popular and we useless and never go anywhere and they have no feeling whatsoever for these technological realities guys to explain something as novel in this field as public/private key pair encryption right watch them fumble and then if they can't even get their heads around that concept and then who you to to judge mouthface currencies or protocols right so what is what is your five years from now what is gonna be happening in your world what do you what are your goals what's your five-year plan a bit or personal well both I mean because I think YouTube the the bit and you are kind of synonymous you know together in a big way we're just gonna go in five years give us the picture well four bit I see most central banks and monetary authorities adopting the bit process and the procedures towards issuance of their national currency base I see more bridges being built out between digital assets and digital currencies and central bank digital systems I see bit finalizing on its multilateral clearing facilities between unions for example carry comb and I see bit being uh the Caribbean community the Caribbean has one of strongest trade unions in the world called carry comb and bit can help unify that under a single trade unions yes so here's an interesting angle because typically the folks that are working for a living look at the crypto space they see the Lambos and they see all the cover stories on the business magazines and they don't think there's anything in it for them you would argue that there is something very important in it for them yeah absolutely are you kidding me I mean you can look into this thing and see Lambos and ten X's and moonshots from those who want to scream a working gang but for the working guy the the main thing is right now that there's so many different industries that can be disrupted and evolved with blockchain transparency transparency accountability integrity but it's the crypto you get purchasing power is not inflated away by the central bank but that's quite important you get saving money especially in the field of what we're doing we're issuing so long central banks to issue their digital dollar but now you're providing a bridge between one of the in my opinion safest asset classes in the world Bitcoin fantastic I mean this is such a multi-faceted story and when you're in the space as you are you get to wear the camo jacket and you also get to wear the Bitcoin socks I think there's a Bitcoin stocks need to get a shot of the Bitcoin socks this is the kind of forward-looking fashion statement that crypto pioneers can wear in public and get you know big applause for it but anyway we got to go Gabrielle thanks so much for being on the Kaiser report much thank you for having me all righty well that's gonna do it for this edition of the cars report with me max Kaiser and Stacy Herbert want to thank our guest Gabriel abet he's co-founder of bit a Barbados based crypto fin tech company making waves in the Caribbean until next time bye y'all
