1
00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:14,960
LAUREN SIVAN, WHO IS A
JOURNALIST IN LOS ANGELES IS

2
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:19,510
JOINING ME TO TALK ABOUT SOME OF
WHAT'S GOING ON IN THE COUNTRY

3
00:00:19,510 --> 00:00:23,800
RIGHT NOW IN REGARD TO SEXUAL
HARASSMENT, SEXUAL ASSAULT.

4
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:28,890
SHE IS AN INCREDIBLE REPORTER
BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY SHE IS ONE

5
00:00:28,890 --> 00:00:32,079
OF THE COURAGEOUS WOMEN WHO CAME
FORWARD WHEN THE HARVEY

6
00:00:32,079 --> 00:00:37,460
WEINSTEIN STORY BROKE AND SHE
SHARED ABOUT HER PRETTY HORRIBLE

7
00:00:37,460 --> 00:00:43,550
EXPERIENCE WITH HIM BACK IN 2007
I BELIEVE, AND I SAY IT'S

8
00:00:43,550 --> 00:00:47,760
COURAGEOUS BECAUSE A LOT OF
TIMES, WOMEN COME FORWARD AND

9
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:50,980
THEY SHARE THEIR EXPERIENCES AND
SIMILAR INSTANCES ESPECIALLY

10
00:00:50,980 --> 00:00:55,080
WHEN IT COMES TO A MAN WITH
POWER THEY'RE USUALLY MET

11
00:00:55,080 --> 00:00:57,220
WITH, IT GOES BEYOND SKEPTICISM.

12
00:00:57,220 --> 00:01:01,530
THEY ARE MET WITH BRUTAL
LANGUAGE, EVEN MORE

13
00:01:01,530 --> 00:01:05,110
DEGRADING TREATMENT AND IT WAS
SO IMPORTANT FOR THE STORY

14
00:01:05,110 --> 00:01:08,550
TO BREAK BECAUSE IT OPENED THE
FLOODGATES AND MADE A LOT

15
00:01:08,550 --> 00:01:10,630
OF OTHER WOMEN FEEL COMFORTABLE
COMING FORWARD SO THANK YOU

16
00:01:10,630 --> 00:01:11,630
FOR DOING THAT.

17
00:01:11,630 --> 00:01:12,729
THANK YOU FOR
JOINING ME.

18
00:01:12,729 --> 00:01:16,090
THANK FOR HAVING ME.

19
00:01:16,090 --> 00:01:19,159
FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO ARE
UNFAMILIAR WITH THE STORY,

20
00:01:19,159 --> 00:01:20,990
I REALLY DON'T WANT HER TO HAVE
TO GET INTO THE DETAILS

21
00:01:20,990 --> 00:01:23,880
AGAIN BUT I WANT TO QUICKLY
SUMMARIZE WHAT HE DID.

22
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:26,640
THIS HAPPENED BACK IN 2007
AT

23
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:29,950
A FAMOUS RESTAURANT
IN MANHATTAN.

24
00:01:29,950 --> 00:01:33,149
SHE WAS WITH HARVEY WEINSTEIN,
HE WAS SHOWING HER AROUND

25
00:01:33,149 --> 00:01:35,829
THE RESTAURANT, AT A
DIFFERENT RESTAURANT.

26
00:01:35,829 --> 00:01:39,340
AT THIS POINT IT WAS A CUBAN
RESTAURANT.

27
00:01:39,340 --> 00:01:43,720
SOCIALISTA WHICH IS NOW
CLOSED.

28
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:49,499
AT ONE POINT HE CORNERS HER
INTO THE BACK OF THE RESTAURANT

29
00:01:49,499 --> 00:01:55,359
AREA AND TRIES TO MAKE A MOVE ON
YOU, AND LAUREN, YOU TOLD HIM

30
00:01:55,359 --> 00:02:01,209
NO, I HAVE A BOYFRIEND AND AT
THAT POINT, HE SAYS, TELLS YOU

31
00:02:01,209 --> 00:02:04,619
TO JUST SHUT UP AND WATCH AND
THEN HE PULLED HIS PENIS

32
00:02:04,619 --> 00:02:07,950
OUT AND MASTURBATES IN FRONT OF
YOU.

33
00:02:07,950 --> 00:02:09,560
YEAH.

34
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:11,170
UNBELIEVABLE.

35
00:02:11,170 --> 00:02:13,709
THAT IS WHAT YOU WENT THROUGH
AND WHAT I AM CURIOUS ABOUT

36
00:02:13,709 --> 00:02:17,620
IS WHAT WAS THE REACTION THAT
YOU GOT FOLLOWING THE

37
00:02:17,620 --> 00:02:20,391
PUBLICATION OF ALL OF THESE
ALLEGATIONS, INCLUDING YOURS?

38
00:02:20,391 --> 00:02:25,230
YOU MEAN NOW?

39
00:02:25,230 --> 00:02:27,760
I CAME OUT INITIALLY BECAUSE THE
NEW YORK TIMES STORY CAME OUT

40
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:32,739
WITH ASHLEY JUDD AND ROSE
MCCOWAN WHO BRAVELY CAME OUT

41
00:02:32,739 --> 00:02:36,709
AGAINST HIM AND I WAS SO PROUD
OF THEM FOR DOING THAT AND I

42
00:02:36,709 --> 00:02:39,890
THOUGHT FINALLY, PEOPLE ARE
GONNA SEE WHAT HE'S LIKE AND

43
00:02:39,890 --> 00:02:43,689
THEN HE CAME OUT WITH THE
RIDICULOUS APOLOGY CALLING THEM

44
00:02:43,689 --> 00:02:46,360
LIARS BASICALLY, GOING ON SOME
POLITICAL RANT.

45
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:48,450
I DIDN'T UNDERSTAND WHAT HE WAS
TALKING ABOUT.

46
00:02:48,450 --> 00:02:50,069
IT MADE ME
FURIOUS

47
00:02:50,069 --> 00:02:53,870
BECAUSE I KNEW WHAT KIND OF GUY
HE WAS BASED ON THE ENCOUNTER I

48
00:02:53,870 --> 00:02:57,361
HAD WITH HIM 10 YEARS PRIOR SO
THAT IS WHY I DECIDED TO COME

49
00:02:57,361 --> 00:03:02,269
OUT PUBLICLY AND IT WAS
DEFINITELY SCARY.

50
00:03:02,269 --> 00:03:05,150
I DIDN'T SLEEP THE WHOLE NIGHT
BEFORE I KNEW IT WAS GOING

51
00:03:05,150 --> 00:03:07,460
TO BE PUBLISHED BECAUSE I STILL
WASN'T SURE I SHOULD ATTACH

52
00:03:07,460 --> 00:03:08,610
MY NAME TO IT.

53
00:03:08,610 --> 00:03:13,019
AS A WOMAN, IT IS LIKE, WHAT
DO YOU HAVE TO GAIN FROM THIS

54
00:03:13,019 --> 00:03:14,019
AND

55
00:03:14,019 --> 00:03:15,700
THEN FOR THE REST OF YOUR LIFE
ANY TIME SOMEONE GOOGLES

56
00:03:15,700 --> 00:03:17,400
YOUR NAME, THIS IS WHAT IS GOING
TO COME UP AND YOU DON'T

57
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:22,799
WANT TO BE FOREVER KNOWN AS THE
POTTED PLANT GIRL.

58
00:03:22,799 --> 00:03:29,480
AND NOT ONLY THAT, DID YOU
WORRY ABOUT THE REACTION TO IT?

59
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:33,680
BECAUSE I THINK ABOUT WOMEN
WHO COME FORWARD

60
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:35,920
SAYING THAT THEY'VE BEEN RAPED
OR SEXUALLY ASSAULTED AND A

61
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:40,409
LOT OF THEM ARE DRAGGED THROUGH
THE MUD AND I WONDER IF YOU

62
00:03:40,409 --> 00:03:43,930
HAD ANY OF THOSE FEARS BEFORE
THAT STORY WAS PUBLISHED,

63
00:03:43,930 --> 00:03:45,939
LIKE WHEN YOU COULDN'T
SLEEP?

64
00:03:45,939 --> 00:03:51,749
WELL, YEAH, I DID HAVE
SOME OF THOSE FEARS AND I

65
00:03:51,749 --> 00:03:54,780
THOUGHT THAT PEOPLE WOULD THINK,
WHAT'S HER AGENDA, WHAT IS

66
00:03:54,780 --> 00:03:57,469
HER ANGLE, WHY IS SHE DOING
THIS?

67
00:03:57,469 --> 00:03:59,120
THAT WAS KIND OF WHY I CAME
FORWARD.

68
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:00,120
I DIDN'T HAVE AN

69
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:02,439
AGENDA AND I DIDN'T WANT
ANYTHING FROM HARVEY WEINSTEIN.

70
00:04:02,439 --> 00:04:06,340
I DIDN'T WANT TO SUE HIM, HIS
MONEY, BE IN A MOVIE, NOTHING.

71
00:04:06,340 --> 00:04:09,349
I FELT LIKE PERHAPS MY VOICE
COULD VALIDATE THEIR VOICES

72
00:04:09,349 --> 00:04:12,020
BECAUSE I DID NOT WORK IN THE
INDUSTRY AND I DIDN'T HAVE

73
00:04:12,020 --> 00:04:15,510
TO WORK WITH HIM LIKE THEY DID.
AND THE REACTION, I

74
00:04:15,510 --> 00:04:17,350
WANT TO SAY 90% POSITIVE.

75
00:04:17,350 --> 00:04:20,620
90% OF WOMEN SAYING WOW, THANK
YOU FOR TELLING YOUR STORY

76
00:04:20,620 --> 00:04:24,320
AND SHARING THEIR OWN STORIES
WITH ME.

77
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:28,130
AS WITH ANYTHING, THERE ARE
PLENTY OF PEOPLE TROLLING ONLINE

78
00:04:28,130 --> 00:04:32,610
WHO WILL SAY, YOU KEPT QUIET FOR
10 YEARS AND YOU COULD'VE HELPED

79
00:04:32,610 --> 00:04:36,270
SOMEONE ELSE WHICH IS FRANKLY IS
NOT TRUE, NUMBER ONE AND NUMBER

80
00:04:36,270 --> 00:04:40,530
TWO, THAT IS WHAT WE NEED TO
CHANGE IS VICTIM BLAMING,

81
00:04:40,530 --> 00:04:43,980
THIS VICTIM SHAMING CULTURE
BECAUSE THAT IS EXACTLY WHY

82
00:04:43,980 --> 00:04:44,980
PEOPLE DON'T COME OUT.

83
00:04:44,980 --> 00:04:46,200
IF YOU
CAME OUT ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED IT

84
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:47,540
WOULD BE LIKE YOU ARE
OVERREACTING AND IT IS

85
00:04:47,540 --> 00:04:51,310
HARVEY WEINSTEIN SO GOOD LUCK
DIANE WE NEED TO COME OUT

86
00:04:51,310 --> 00:04:53,730
THEY SAY, WHAT TOOK YOU SO LONG
QUESTION YOU CAN'T WIN.

87
00:04:53,730 --> 00:04:55,610
I WANT TO GET TO THAT.

88
00:04:55,610 --> 00:04:59,740
THE QUESTION OF WHY IT TAKES
PEOPLE SEWING TO COME FORWARD.

89
00:04:59,740 --> 00:05:03,390
A WAS REPORTED AND UNFORTUNATELY
WE DIDN'T GET A CHANCE TO

90
00:05:03,390 --> 00:05:05,340
COVER THE STORY UNTIL NOW TO
THINK IT IS REALLY

91
00:05:05,340 --> 00:05:07,290
IMPORTANT TO DISCUSS IT.

92
00:05:07,290 --> 00:05:11,740
IT WAS REPORTED THAT HARVEY
WEINSTEIN WOULD HIRE OPPOSITION

93
00:05:11,740 --> 00:05:16,750
RESEARCHERS, VERY PROMINENT
OPPOSITION RESEARCHERS TO START

94
00:05:16,750 --> 00:05:21,750
SPYING ON THE ACCUSERS AND THEN
HE WOULD TRY TO PUSH FOR A SMEAR

95
00:05:21,750 --> 00:05:26,690
CAMPAIGN TO TAKE AWAY ANY
CREDIBILITY THAT THESE WOMEN MAY

96
00:05:26,690 --> 00:05:30,710
HAVE AND TO AGAIN DRAG THEM TO
THE MUD AND THE REASON WHY WE

97
00:05:30,710 --> 00:05:34,620
KNOW ABOUT THAT IS BECAUSE ROAD
IN PHARAOH SPOKE VERY CANDIDLY

98
00:05:34,620 --> 00:05:39,860
ABOUT WHO HE HIRED AND WHAT HE
PLANNED ON DOING AND SO THE

99
00:05:39,860 --> 00:05:43,380
COMPANY, THE FIRMS INCLUDED
KROLL, ONE OF THE LARGEST

100
00:05:43,380 --> 00:05:46,820
CORPORATE INTELLIGENCE COMPANIES
AND AN ENTERPRISE RUN

101
00:05:46,820 --> 00:05:51,370
LARGELY BY FORMER OFFICERS OF
ISREALI

102
00:05:51,370 --> 00:05:58,420
INTELLIGENCE AGENCIES SO IT WAS
ALSO BECOMING INCREASINGLY

103
00:05:58,420 --> 00:06:03,520
OBVIOUS THAT THIS WAS GOING ON
BECAUSE ROSE MCCOWAN WAS

104
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:06,570
NOTICING THAT PEOPLE WERE ASKING
HER VERY PERSONAL QUESTIONS AND

105
00:06:06,570 --> 00:06:08,960
FOLLOWING HER AROUND AND THEN IT
TURNED OUT SOME OF THESE PEOPLE

106
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:13,900
ENDED UP BEING SPIES AND
RESEARCHERS.

107
00:06:13,900 --> 00:06:17,710
AT LEAST MY TAKE IS THAT ANY
PERSON WHO IS NOT IN A

108
00:06:17,710 --> 00:06:21,650
POSITION OF POWER WOULD BE
FEARFUL THAT THEY WOULD BE

109
00:06:21,650 --> 00:06:24,570
FOLLOWED AROUND AND SMEARED
AND THEIR NAME WOULD BE

110
00:06:24,570 --> 00:06:26,300
COMPLETELY DESTROYED EVEN THOUGH
THEY ARE THE VICTIMS.

111
00:06:26,300 --> 00:06:29,720
AND WE SAW IT WITH THE
ITALIAN ACTRESS AND MODEL WHO

112
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:33,560
ACTUALLY HAD EVIDENCE, WHO HAD A
RECORDING, AN AUDIO RECORDING OF

113
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:40,040
HIM RELENTLESSLY DRAGGING HER
INTO HIS HOTEL ROOM AND YET,

114
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:43,830
NOTHING WAS DONE ABOUT THAT AND
THEN HE HAD JOURNALISTS AT THE

115
00:06:43,830 --> 00:06:47,890
NEW YORK POST WRITE ARTICLES
BASICALLY SMEARING HER

116
00:06:47,890 --> 00:06:49,900
SAYING, SHE IS ACCUSING HIM OF
WHAT?

117
00:06:49,900 --> 00:06:51,560
SHE SHOWED UP AT HIS PARTY.

118
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:53,190
SHE DID THIS AND THAT.

119
00:06:53,190 --> 00:06:55,380
INSINUATING THAT SHE WAS A LIAR
AND TRYING TO GET SOMETHING

120
00:06:55,380 --> 00:06:58,810
OUT OF HIM SO WHY WOULD ANYONE
HAD EVER COME FORWARD?

121
00:06:58,810 --> 00:07:02,020
THERE WAS NO WINNING AND IF
YOU HAD TO WORK IN THE

122
00:07:02,020 --> 00:07:05,280
INDUSTRY, IF YOU HAD TO WORK
WITH HIM, JUST IMAGINE

123
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:07,990
HAVING TO DEAL WITH THIS GUY.

124
00:07:07,990 --> 00:07:11,040
DARYL HANNAH SAID SHE WAS
MOVING A DRESSER IN FRONT OF HER

125
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:12,040
HOTEL

126
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:14,910
ROOM DOOR TO KEEP HIM OUT AND
WHEN SHE COMPLAINED ABOUT IT SHE

127
00:07:14,910 --> 00:07:17,050
WAS TAKEN OFF THE PRESS TOUR.

128
00:07:17,050 --> 00:07:18,640
JUST IMAGINE.

129
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:22,540
BEFORE RIGHT NOW THERE WAS NO
UPSIDE TO COMING FORWARD

130
00:07:22,540 --> 00:07:25,400
WITH YOUR STORY DIVER SOMETHING
YOU HAD TO KEEP A SECRET,

131
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:28,410
DEAL WITH, AND THEN TO THIS
WEIRD TAP DANCE WITH THIS

132
00:07:28,410 --> 00:07:31,610
PERSON IF YOU STILL HAD TO WORK
WITH HIM TO BE POLITE AND

133
00:07:31,610 --> 00:07:33,760
TRY TO JUST NOT BE ALONE WITH
HIM.

134
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:36,740
WOMEN SHOULDN'T HAVE TO DEAL
WITH THAT, ESPECIALLY IN

135
00:07:36,740 --> 00:07:37,740
THE WORKPLACE.

136
00:07:37,740 --> 00:07:39,950
NEW DID HAD TO DEAL WITH HIM
THAT YOU DIDN'T NECESSARILY

137
00:07:39,950 --> 00:07:43,560
TO COMMUNICATE WITH HIM BUT YOU
HAVE TO SEE THEM AROUND

138
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:46,300
FOLLOWING THAT PRETTY TERRIBLE
ENCOUNTER.

139
00:07:46,300 --> 00:07:49,430
WHEN I CAME TO HOLLYWOOD,
GADI I WOULD COVER RED CARPET

140
00:07:49,430 --> 00:07:52,680
EVENT ALL THE TIME SO HE WOULD
OFTENTIMES BE ON THE RED CARPET

141
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:56,810
BECAUSE A LOT OF HIS MOVIES GET
NOMINATED AND I JUST WHICH I MY

142
00:07:56,810 --> 00:08:00,250
BEST TO NEVER HAVE TO INTERVIEW
HIM OR PRETEND I DIDN'T SEE HIM

143
00:08:00,250 --> 00:08:05,350
IF HE WENT BY AND I THINK I DID
ONCE HAVE TO TALK TO HIM AT A

144
00:08:05,350 --> 00:08:10,910
RED CARPET YEARS AGO AND HE HAD
NO IDEA WHO I WAS.

145
00:08:10,910 --> 00:08:13,990
HE DIDN'T SHOW ANY RECOGNITION
WHICH I WAS GRATEFUL FOR,

146
00:08:13,990 --> 00:08:14,990
BY THE WAY.

147
00:08:14,990 --> 00:08:18,550
BUT IT IS TELLING.

148
00:08:18,550 --> 00:08:21,930
I THINK YOU WERE ON MEGYN
KELLY'S SHOW WHEN YOU SAID THIS,

149
00:08:21,930 --> 00:08:26,090
THAT THAT MADE IT ABUNDANTLY
CLEAR THAT YOU WERE NOT THE

150
00:08:26,090 --> 00:08:28,790
ONLY VICTIM, THAT THERE HAD BEEN
MANY OTHERS.

151
00:08:28,790 --> 00:08:31,150
I KNEW THAT NIGHT THAT
THIS GOES ON ALL THE TIME

152
00:08:31,150 --> 00:08:35,849
BECAUSE IT WAS LESS THAN AN HOUR
FROM MEETING HIM, A STRANGER,

153
00:08:35,849 --> 00:08:39,320
TO HAVING HIM EXPOSE HIMSELF.

154
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:40,760
DO THE MATH, OVER 30

155
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:43,150
YEARS, HOW MANY ENCOUNTERS HE
MUST'VE HAD WITH WOMEN THAT

156
00:08:43,150 --> 00:08:47,650
HE WOULD NEVER SEEK A THAT HE
DID SEE AGAIN.

157
00:08:47,650 --> 00:08:49,040
THERE HAVE TO BE THOUSANDS.

158
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:52,040
RIGHT OUT THERE PROBABLY
ARE MORE THAT I DON'T KNOW

159
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:55,230
ABOUT, BUT THE LATEST NUMBER
THAT I READ WAS 80

160
00:08:55,230 --> 00:09:00,740
WOMEN ACCUSING HIM OF SEXUAL
HARASSMENT, SEXUAL ASSAULT.

161
00:09:00,740 --> 00:09:03,910
I WANT TO CUT A WRAP OF THE
CONVERSATION BY TALKING ABOUT

162
00:09:03,910 --> 00:09:07,730
THE CULTURE BECAUSE THIS IS NOT
SIMPLY A HARVEY WEINSTEIN

163
00:09:07,730 --> 00:09:09,750
PROBLEM, IT IS NOT NICELY DID
INCIDENT.

164
00:09:09,750 --> 00:09:14,420
AS YOU GUYS KNOW, THIS IS NOW
TRANSFERRED ONTO OTHER

165
00:09:14,420 --> 00:09:17,690
PROFESSIONS, OTHER INDUSTRIES
AND IN MY OPINION, THIS

166
00:09:17,690 --> 00:09:21,950
SHOWS THAT THERE IS A CULTURAL
ISSUE HERE AND IT IS NOT A

167
00:09:21,950 --> 00:09:25,730
CULTURAL ISSUE SAYING, ALL MEN,
THEY NEED TO BE TALKED TO

168
00:09:25,730 --> 00:09:28,540
DOT IT SHOWS THAT THERE ARE
PEOPLE IN POSITIONS OF

169
00:09:28,540 --> 00:09:32,880
POWER WHO WILL ABUSE THAT POWER
AND THEY GET AWAY WITH IT.

170
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:36,990
THEY'VE GOTTEN AWAY WITH IT FOR
A LONG TIME AND I WANT TO GET

171
00:09:36,990 --> 00:09:39,940
YOUR SENSE OF WHAT THE FUTURE
HOLDS.

172
00:09:39,940 --> 00:09:42,670
DO YOU THINK THE OPENING OF THE
FLOODGATES IS REALLY GOING

173
00:09:42,670 --> 00:09:46,000
TO LEAD TO CHANGE OR IS THIS
JUST THE HOT STORY FOR THE

174
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,780
MOMENT AND THEN PEOPLE WILL LOSE
INTEREST?

175
00:09:48,780 --> 00:09:49,780
I HOPE NOT.

176
00:09:49,780 --> 00:09:54,500
I HOPE REAL CHANGE COMES AND I
WANT TO MAKE IT AS SPECIFIC AS

177
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:58,100
WE POSSIBLY CAN OVER WHAT THAT
CHANGE SHOULD AND COULD LOOK

178
00:09:58,100 --> 00:10:01,530
LIKE BECAUSE AS GREAT AS IS IT
IS TO HEAR ALL THE STORIES IN

179
00:10:01,530 --> 00:10:05,820
THE MEDIA CAMPAIGN, IF
EVERYTHING STAYS THE WAY IT WILL

180
00:10:05,820 --> 00:10:09,580
THEN NOTHING WILL CHANGE.

181
00:10:09,580 --> 00:10:10,990
AT
THE VERY LEAST I THINK NOW THE

182
00:10:10,990 --> 00:10:13,850
SOME NEW PEOPLE COME FORWARD I
THINK WOMEN WILL BE MUCH

183
00:10:13,850 --> 00:10:18,870
MORE, THEY WILL CALL IT OUTRIGHT
WHEN IT HAPPENS IN REAL

184
00:10:18,870 --> 00:10:19,870
TIME, RIGHT WHEN THEY SEE IT.

185
00:10:19,870 --> 00:10:22,960
THERE NO LONGER GOING TO HAVE
THAT TERRIFIED FEAR THAT NO

186
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:26,680
ONE WILL BELIEVE THEM OR THEY
WILL BE SHUT UP OR SMEARED.

187
00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:29,700
I THINK THAT THAT HAS MADE
IT MORE COMFORTABLE FOR

188
00:10:29,700 --> 00:10:30,700
WOMEN TO COME FORWARD.

189
00:10:30,700 --> 00:10:33,370
THE OTHER THING I THINK IS THIS
IDEA THAT THE RICH AND THE

190
00:10:33,370 --> 00:10:40,060
POWERFUL CAN PAY THEIR WAY OUT
OF TROUBLE, THAT NEEDS TO END.

191
00:10:40,060 --> 00:10:43,280
THE NONDISCLOSURE
AGREEMENTS IS SOMETHING THAT I

192
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:45,830
THINK NEEDS TO END WHEN IT COMES
TO SEXUAL HARASSMENT.

193
00:10:45,830 --> 00:10:50,840
TO PAY OFF A VICTIM BECAUSE OF
YOUR EGREGIOUS BEHAVIOR AND THEN

194
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:53,150
TO CONTINUE THAT BEHAVIOR
BECAUSE SHE CAN NO LONGER SPEAK

195
00:10:53,150 --> 00:10:56,870
ABOUT IT, THAT HAS TO END
BECAUSE IN MANY OF THESE CASES

196
00:10:56,870 --> 00:11:00,280
AS YOU BROUGHT UP, WE'RE NOT
JUST TALKING ABOUT AN

197
00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:01,350
OFF-COLOR COMMENT.

198
00:11:01,350 --> 00:11:05,250
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT ASSAULT,
RAPE, THOSE ARE FELONIES.

199
00:11:05,250 --> 00:11:06,590
CRIMES AND THEY SHOULD NOT BE
COVERED UP.

200
00:11:06,590 --> 00:11:16,840
THAT IS A GREAT POINT 
THAT I

201
00:11:16,840 --> 00:00:00,000
AGREE WITH YOU.
