1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:04,799
North Korea has the fifth largest active army
in the world and a history of erratic and

2
00:00:04,799 --> 00:00:09,200
aggressive behavior. That includes this past
August, when they threatened to attack the

3
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:14,559
US with nuclear force. So, how seriously should
we take a threat like that? How powerful is

4
00:00:14,559 --> 00:00:16,230
North Korea?

5
00:00:16,230 --> 00:00:20,689
As I said, North Korea has the fifth largest
active military in the world, which should

6
00:00:20,689 --> 00:00:25,710
not be taken lightly. They also have a huge
number of armaments -- an estimated 13,000

7
00:00:25,710 --> 00:00:30,289
guns along their border with South Korea.
If they were to attack South Korea, or any

8
00:00:30,289 --> 00:00:34,770
other nearby nation, they could inflict an
enormous amount of damage in a very short

9
00:00:34,770 --> 00:00:40,200
period of time. They could also potentially
overwhelm those nations with sheer manpower.

10
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:46,060
In addition to the 690,000 to 1.1 million
active troops North Korea is rumored to have,

11
00:00:46,060 --> 00:00:52,160
they may also have between 4.1 and up to 7.7
million soldiers in reserve. So, yes. They

12
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:56,560
are a legitimate threat. But... only to the
immediate surrounding nations, and only for

13
00:00:56,560 --> 00:00:58,290
a short period of time.

14
00:00:58,290 --> 00:01:03,400
North Korea’s air force and navy are extremely
outdated and under-used. According to experts,

15
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:08,440
they often don’t have enough fuel to keep
all of their planes operational, and consequently,

16
00:01:08,440 --> 00:01:13,610
a lot of their pilots have little experience
actually flying. They have a large navy, but

17
00:01:13,610 --> 00:01:18,770
it is the same problem there. Outdated technology
and not enough fuel. A prominent response

18
00:01:18,770 --> 00:01:22,880
by a better equipped nation, like the United
States, would quickly outdo North Korea’s

19
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:22,960
main forces. Experts also argue that North
Korea would be incapable of sustaining a long

20
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:24,800
term war. The country is already struggling
with food and fuel shortages.

21
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:28,370
Some even speculate that with or without a
war, the current North Korean leadership may

22
00:01:28,370 --> 00:01:34,180
not last. There are constantly rumors of impending
collapse or revolt. The central government

23
00:01:34,180 --> 00:01:39,470
is widely perceived as being extremely corrupt,
draconian, and mismanaged. And the gap between

24
00:01:39,470 --> 00:01:45,220
the people and their leaders is wide. A situation
that often ends in revolt or collapse. So,

25
00:01:45,220 --> 00:01:49,050
yes North Korea is a threat, like a bomb or
a gun is a threat. But, they aren't the great

26
00:01:49,050 --> 00:01:53,750
threat that a superpower would be, or even
a terrorist group could be, because North

27
00:01:53,750 --> 00:01:58,090
Korea is an isolated nation that does not
export harmful ideals; like Al Qaeda does

28
00:01:58,090 --> 00:02:01,040
now, or Soviet Russia did during the Cold
War.

29
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:05,990
This leaves us only one item left to discuss,
which is North Korea’s nuclear capabilities.

30
00:02:05,990 --> 00:02:07,540
Do they have the bomb?

31
00:02:07,540 --> 00:02:12,720
No, they do not have the bomb. They have the
materials to MAKE a bomb, but they are currently

32
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:17,720
unable to arm a warhead with those materials.
So, as of now, they can not launch a nuclear

33
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:23,110
strike. They can simply talk about it, which
isn’t particularly threatening.
