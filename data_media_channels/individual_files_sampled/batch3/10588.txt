hello I'm Max Keiser this is the Kaiser report the show that seeks to educate inform mesmerize and steal your crypto wallets while you're not watching while you're watching but unaware you see what happened there max tuned into the last episode his hands are in my shot but he tuned into the last episode and what he found was an explanation for why all his Bitcoin were missing out of that wallet oh my god why did you do it tell me so you know we had another Christmas present over Christmas and that was from Donald Trump and many people particularly in the markets anyway the equity markets and the Dow Jones and the sp500 they had a very good Christmas because tax forea sparks stock buying panic Dow does something it has never ever done before the Dow closed at its 70th record high of the year it has never done that before in its 100-plus history just so you could see the number of down months versus the number of up months see down months are in red this is going back to oh about 1988 and green is up months Donald Trump is the only one that has had never ending up months in the Dow Jones while he's been in his first year of president well it's not hard to explain why please explain it Max Keiser you know markets tend to go up and down based on things like the business cycle which is tied to interest rate cycles tied to global trade imbalances and trade cycles but what we've seen in the last 20 years in America and in the last 10 years in particular with interest rates near zero effectively the Federal Reserve Bank has opened the door to the vault of the S&P 500 and allowed a few corporations to run in and grab all stocks at zero cost to them tomber acquisition stock buybacks this is what I call America being taken private through a massive leveraged buyout financed by 0% interest rates so there is no I don't I don't think they will there will ever be a down market in that one we're like we are leaving the era of a free market capitalist system in America we're answering neo feudalism so there'll be a few private equity funds a few hedge funds and a few mega corporations alone ninety-five percent of all the equity and everyone else will be essentially serfs okay this is Donald Trump's legacy putting all kidding aside is that he's engineered neo feudalism in America if those who go with them are not opposed to it because they're being paid off it's like when Britain ended slavery they did so by paying off the slave masters a huge amount of money here in America they're ending free market capitalism and they're doing it by paying off the oligarchs American oligarchs a huge sack of money and full stop okay we'll get into some more of the particulars in a moment but I want to turn to another headline regarding tax cuts in the past and these you know they call them the tax holidays to encourage corporations like Apple which has hundreds of billions of dollars sitting overseas that they repatriate their money and bring it back in to the United States and the theory under Obama and the theory under you know George Bush the second was that this tax holiday would somehow encourage more jobs and growth in the economy well it never did firms spent 94 percent of 2004 tax holiday benefit on buybacks and dividends so mr. Dharmapala co-authored a working paper for the National Bureau of Economic Research that found that after companies brought back cash during a tax holiday in 2004 they spent 79 cents of every dollar on share repurchases and 15 cents on dividends so it just goes back to that you know basically it's 1% of the population or the top 20 percent that owned all of the shares of the sp500 so it's just going to a few people it's giving back money to the oligarchs I'm taking notes here because you're making such excellent points it was mr. dummy Kodama Paulo yes University of Chicago yes let's talk about this so jobs wages of purchasing power so this is not about jobs in the sense that you are creating jobs with wages that are meaningful in any way and additionally because of the massive printing and bailing out of banks everyone's purchasing power is eroding quite rapidly so they say there's no inflation that's a lie because it's miss Smith's interpreting the salient data one needs to look at to understand if this economy is in fact growing in any meaningful way this is the stock repurchase that you just mentioned again fuelled by zero money I can buy this building easily if I can borrow money at 0% I can make any offer in the world any I want to make I could offer this studio for a billion dollars doesn't make any difference if the interest I'm paying on my loan is zero I can offer anything if I'm if I'm buying a corporation for 10 billion 20 billion 30 billion 50 billion dollars using borrowed money and I pay zero on that money then I can make any offer I want I get all the income from the slaves the American slave class the permanent American underclass so dividends the buybacks and dividends most of it went to the rest of it did not much go into capital expenditure I investment in the future of these corporations here in America and thus wage growth or job growth in fact a lot of the rest went to mergers and acquisitions so I eat jobs getting cut because usually when there's a mergers and acquisition you see job cuts because that's how they create efficiency they cut half the jobs so in fact the tax holidays could actually be worse for the number of jobs rather than but it's great for the stock market exactly the mergers and acquisitions you're filling in all the details - exactly what I'm saying they the M&A the mergers and acquisitions are consolidating to the Ola darks that the jobs are being cut it's not about job growth when Trump says I'm creating jobs okay replace that puckering little orange lip with you know a sphincter because he's talking nonsense and the record proves it the data proves it in a reality driven world that that's clearly proven if you're in stocks you're getting a big payout America is being sold out essentially and it cost a bunch of money people are taking a sack of money America is dead dead dead dead because of this let's talk about the other situation here is that on the one hand you know now all the Democrats and MSNBC source are saying Oh Donald Trump is horrible and these are you know a giveaway to the oligarchs just as we've just said here but the fact is they reduce our taxes mine and yours to what we were paying in the United Kingdom and the United Kingdom has a National Health Service they have more of a welfare state than here less so than Europe as they're getting dismantling it but that raises a question well how progressive were our tax rates and are they because all of our taxes now anyway whether they're 40 percent or 20 percent or ninety percent or ten percent all of it goes to the military-industrial complex is connected guys to the military none of it goes anyway to a health care system or you know a more equitable distribution or economy and like that protects some of the weakest amongst us so in why are they not addressing where the actual taxes go if they want to be progressive you know the Democrats are the ones remember just at the in the budget when back in all yes or September Trump had asked for like a 10% increase and the Pentagon's budget and they were like no no no 15% you got to take more so they added like billions that Trump I didn't even ask for so where that's regressive why why are they now saying like virtually signalling the how progressive and and liberal and and how they care about the poor people like what why now and why did they focus all of their media airtime on a foreign country law over there you know Russia they didn't focus on domestic policy nobody even knew about this stuff until it happened look the corporate tax rate in America for the sp500 adjusted for tax tax avoidance and tax loopholes last year was roughly five percent yeah post this tax reform will be roughly five percent their taxes are going to exactly be exactly the same they don't pay taxes General Electric at a 70,000 page tax return that they filed and they paid zero tax as a matter of fact they got a tax rebate so the tax rate for corporations will be the same but this idea of lowering taxes is a vote grabber it's propaganda it's it's probably pass through taxes for small and medium-sized enterprises it's not General Electric it's not a pass through Apple is not a pass through Fox Corporation News Corporation are not pass throughs these are mama pops these are like people with a hundred thousand two hundred thousand three hundred thousand dollars sort of income there's the point you've made before is that they'll simply raise the obama care premium to offset any tax game yeah in other words you're not gonna see that game know you're not gonna get into your pocket is it whatever gain will always have to go to Lockheed Martin and Ray that's what we have here mmm-hmm you also mentioned savings and I wanted to bring this up this is a tweet from the st. Louis Fed a tweet from them this was before Christmas but you know I was so busy hypnotizing you and previous episode no and you were so reason unburdened of that hundred thousand Bitcoin that was weighing down on my conscious well this is from the st. Louis Fed and talk to you about savings and and the economy remarkable negative interest rates may seem ludicrous but not if they succeed in pushing people to invest in something more stimulating to the economy than government bonds so they're flirting negative interest rates and that this may be a good way to get people out of government bonds and into something more stimulating to the economy like what what's more stimulating to the economy at this point more more Lockheed Martin some more surveilling us or what the debt per household in America if you had the national debt the unaccounted for dad like Social Security and Medicare Medicaid the corporate debt and you had all that debt together I haven't seen the numbers lately but it's something in excess of $500,000 per household and because the debt cellars Wall Street who packages debt cells debt makes money and profits and fees from debt they feel like they need to make even greater profits they have a big fat cattle prod that they stick into everyone's back and they say negative interest rates are good for you go buy more go give us more of your money go into debt go buy margin go into Marge and give us more so this is abusive essentially Wall Street's been given a cattle prod and a noose and you can take your pick either you get electrocuted to near death or we're gonna kill you and Trump's like make America more larsson istic and more deadly Thank You Trump he's the last American president I predict hey stay tuned for the second half a whole lot more coming your way hi I'm welcome back to the Kaiser report I'm Max Keiser Hey we're here with Michael Pento Michael how are you I'm doing great thanks for having me back max I should mention you earth Pento port dolly um pent up portfolio strategies Penta port thought your money manager I do you're a gold lover oh you are kind of hedging your bet during these gold times of flatness to juice the returns a little bit so you're in the mart have an inflation deflation portfolio doesn't just buy gold in short stocks all the time now to stop clock here oh you do that so I have dividend stocks yeah I think the market has a few more months of fumes to run on or run over to cliff before falling a wily coyote before they drop for it cry actually craters let's talk a little bit about that so the market is defying expectations by continuing to trade higher what's driving it I mean come on what's driving take a guess it's Bitcoin no it's fifteen trillion dollars of artificial money printing from the Federal Reserve yes from the ECB from the BOJ the PBOC yeah absolutely you know let's just talk about how overvalued this this market is the market cap of stocks as a relationship to the economy is now a hundred and forty two percent max well a hundred and forty two that has never happened outside of the very tail end of 1999 and just before March of 2000 yeah okay so we are about as overvalued as we've ever been in the history of the market the average of that ratio is 50% so we're extremely dangerous here and it doesn't have much longer to go before absolutely craters in my opinion okay so that's so silver pigs you really should be heads right now if you just if you're in a Bayern hold situation be hedged I got a question for you speaking about central banks Stanley Druckenmiller who was 30 percent annualized rate of returns George Soros is money manager considered to be one of the best you know of all time he was on TV recently and he said that the Fed should stop their engineered deflation and engineer deflation yeah and they because all they're doing is causing asset bubbles engineer deflate in other words by keeping interest rates low right they are engineering the deflation in that they are keeping the zombie banks alive if the zombie banks were to collapse there's no shoots with the collapse then the bond market would collapse and interest rates would go to a more normal 4% 5% on your on the Treasury bond well I'll tell you what the Fed did do along with the other ecv they destroyed the entire free market worldwide there is no more free market they did that by printing fifteen trillion dollars taking interest rates to 0% why so you and I can borrow a lot more money you know because the savings rate on consumers now has plummeted to 3.2 percent it used to be 10 percent for decade after decade the people are not borrowing money that velocity money is dead the savings rate is 3.2 percent it's bad max max we've we've piled on as a nation 11 trillion dollars of debt since 2008 we're loaded with debt and for every 1% increase in interest rates mr. Drucker Miller says ok let's let interest rates rise which is what would happen if central bank stepped away the German Bundestag the hell is it doing a 30 basis points she should be 4% look at nominal GDP that's where the tenure should be the 10 years 30 beeps 1/3 of 1% should be 4 or 500 basis points okay for every 100 basis point 1% move up in interest rates we pay an extra 200 billion dollars in interest expense right okay consumers paid seven point four billion dollars in credit card interest just because the Fed raises raise rates four times okay we cannot tolerate real interest rates because this overvalued bloated stock market would come cratering down I advocate I defend mr. Druckenmiller we need to get back to reality right in the stock market let the markets dictate where interest rates should go right but don't be fooled we would have a deflationary depression that would pervade across the globe and I'm all for it because that's the only way we're gonna get back to a sustainable viable economy in the world I'm a little bit worked up a little bit upset because of this because people are being they're crying they're crowded into these bubbles which are extent all over the globe and they're going to get crushed so the sooner they burst and they will burst it's inevitable the sooner they burst the less people will get injured well it's beyond that because a Merry Christmas by the way yes we enjoy our figgy pudding but it's too late you know because there's not going to be a gradual normalization of interest rates there's gonna be an horrific crash because you remember they bailed out the creditors in 2008 and they just gave more money to build more leveraged Ponzi schemes in the sky with fiat money and fractional reserve banking and multiples and stock buybacks you know stock buybacks used to be illegal no now they're legal and so this when it falls off again it'll be catastrophic that we already have so I mean I understand you're positioning yourself you know you're hedging yourself you're ready to go short you think gold is something to go to in a rational rationalization of markets right and not now though we have about 10% of the portfolio's in gold because gold does not like rising real interest rates so right now you know we have mr. mr. Powell coming on to the Fed Janet yellen's last stand is going to be today she will like today which is a recorded interview but she was gonna raise rates again today December 13th that we record this interview she is supposedly gonna raise rates three or four more times in 2018 mr. Powell will be the one doing that not Janet Yellen and that means nominal rates are will be rising real interest rates will be rising and that's not very good for gold which is one of the reasons why bitcoin is outperforming gold because bitcoin you brought up Bitcoin not B but you brought up I did okay good I mean good for you congratulations though complimenti a great job Bitcoin I've been I've been asked about Bitcoin for two years now and for two years I've been dead wrong okay but bitcoin is not gold 2.0 it's not gold 0.2 Bitcoin if you understand a little bit of technology behind it yeah I think you have a private key you've got a public key what are they it's just about 64 numbers and letters numbers and letters aren't durable numbers and letters aren't rare numbers and letters aren't money and let's start back by the taxing authority of a government or the or the US military might here's the thing about there's numbers if these numbers and letters were backed by gold or oil which some private blockchains do then they have money but they're certainly not rare there's a thousand plus of these currencies out there and if I was you I'm gonna give you my early Christmas present take some profits okay that that's your thought couple of points so one aspect about Bitcoin that it gains a lot of attention people liked about it is that they can divorce themselves from the financial system they don't need to be associated with a bank they don't need to have anything to do with the banking system right they're completely outside of the banking system that's extremely appealing for a lot of people I understand that completely okay and we all know that you know that the value of something is what someone's willing to pay for it absolutely and the price to get out of the banking system yes you know and into Bitcoin yes is that currently what the price is number one decentralized no centralization speaks to the security of Bitcoin you said that there's nothing particularly sacred about the numeric alphanumeric Keys etc but it is an encrypted protocol that is secured by a network of nodes that audit it every ten minutes yes that give it anti-censorship quality so you know government no well I thought about you come in there and muck about I love that number too okay number three yeah there are other crypto currencies but nothing at this particular configuration of all the elements that make up the technology like gold is number 79 on the periodic table this uses money not you don't you don't use you know plutonium as money for four reasons because it doesn't have the physical qualities you would want in money you use gold and silver the same thing with these other cryptocurrencies there they're out there but then again with gold you have other silver palladium platinum it's like they're not making new elements every day Bitcoin no but but somebody I know it's decentralized but somebody decided hey let's work this thing and let's make good Bitcoin gold and Bitcoin cash and then you have a theory a man like coin crypto market right well i bitcoins 300 billion dollars one third the size of Apple Inc Inc is a very small market no CNBC has how much Bitcoin week this week oh it's you know everybody has an opinion about Bitcoin this year you said fifteen trillion money printed yes bail out banks etc what value did that money have in physical reality if you were to stick it all into a room and you were to examine it in terms of its intrinsic value beyond the printing on the paper sorry are we comparing currency with Bitcoin if king of worthless junk it's disgusting it's disgusting fiat currencies except you need them to pay taxes and they're backed by the military of the country here's my promise me the biggest problem with crypto currencies is this and I'm gonna ask you a question cuz I might I want your opinion on this if the government wanted to shut down cryptocurrencies I believe they could do it very easily now and let me explain I know they couldn't shut down the entire network but could they ban Bitcoin exchanges if they did so which they could do coin base and all these other they could do it very easily liquidity evaporates overnight then they could make it illegal suit conduct commerce in Bitcoin you need an application to use your Bitcoin very public application if if I could see it the government can see it so I'm not gonna risk fines or imprisonment why is the government and I I'm not a conspiracy theory person max but why is the government allowing so much rope for cryptocurrencies to hang themselves with I believe the government understands that we're going for another recession slash depression like we've never seen before in the globe and they're gonna need to abolish physical currency and they want the public to get used to using digital currencies we're gonna get something called a Fed coin in the near future which will allow them to impose negative nominal interest rates in the banking system and that's the reason why they're letting this cryptocurrency craze get so out of hand you bring up some great points and and you've done I've done some reading since the last time you are on the show not really to unpack some of these points that you're making first of all I would agree that the exchanges are a portent of vulnerability because the on-ramp from Fiat to crypto are at these exchanges the exchanges are vulnerable in two ways number one as you point out they could be outlawed in some way or shut down by the government number one number two we have a lot of banks out there that have been seeking and have been granted various patents and the under patent protection and patent law they could claim that these exchanges have to be shut down under intellectual property rights and I know having patents myself in this area how that could absolutely the other point in terms of migrating everyone off into digital coin or those digital coins that fed coin mm-hmm would be what would be a coin that has a time element to it like you are you're you get money but your money expires like a coupon and that's one way to can get people to spend I think it has a positive negative interest rate right so that's built into that then they have an interest in this now what about philosophy velocity of money yeah skyrocketing yeah inflation what would what because you're making in mind something like that Mack Maxwell Green reversal basic income SERP Newark oh oh we got to go can we pick this up at a next segment this is a real cliffhanger oh wow all right right there don't go away oh no hey goodbye goodbye goodbye for now thank you Michael Pento thank you for being on the show this has been the Kaiser report you can catch us on Twitter at Kaiser
