16
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:51,870
of the great reversal in what lemon what

17

20
00:00:57,360 --> 00:00:59,309
you know people who were stocking up on

21
00:00:59,309 --> 00:01:01,260
guns gun sales were shooting through the

22
00:01:01,260 --> 00:01:02,969
roof people were<font color="#E5E5E5"> talking about you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font>

23
00:01:02,969 --> 00:01:04,650
oh you know how much water do you have

24
00:01:04,650 --> 00:01:06,720
to have in your apartment to survive if

25
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:08,880
<font color="#CCCCCC">the if the water system</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> shuts down it</font>

26
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:12,840
was epic end of the earth time and then

27
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:15,540
the market proved that<font color="#E5E5E5"> everybody's an</font>

28
00:01:15,540 --> 00:01:17,520
idiot nobody knew what was going to

29
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:20,790
happen and it just shot right up for

30
00:01:20,790 --> 00:01:22,439
most<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the year we've hit a slump now</font>

31
00:01:22,439 --> 00:01:27,000
but<font color="#CCCCCC"> for most of the year it was a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the a</font>

32
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,640
tremendous rally that everybody badmouth

33
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:31,500
from the very beginning as soon<font color="#E5E5E5"> as it</font>

34
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:34,049
started everybody said uh you know the

35
00:01:34,049 --> 00:01:36,090
last a month it's a sucker's rare i get

36
00:01:36,090 --> 00:01:38,369
a lot take a profit yeah exactly and

37
00:01:38,369 --> 00:01:40,290
including a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the smartest</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> people</font>

38
00:01:40,290 --> 00:01:42,960
who saw the collapse coming<font color="#E5E5E5"> right and</font>

39
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:44,820
they couldn't appreciate when<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's or</font>

40
00:01:44,820 --> 00:01:46,380
not and what do you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know what are some</font>

41
00:01:46,380 --> 00:01:47,670
theories I mean I<font color="#CCCCCC"> guess the big one is</font>

42
00:01:47,670 --> 00:01:50,250
fed liquidity and the actions of Ben

43
00:01:50,250 --> 00:01:52,619
Bernanke just<font color="#E5E5E5"> absolute pushing dollars</font>

44
00:01:52,619 --> 00:01:54,540
in every corner of the world I'd yeah

45
00:01:54,540 --> 00:01:57,090
I'd seems to be the big they get a point

46
00:01:57,090 --> 00:01:59,040
the one thing I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think that the quiddity</font>

47
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:04,890
you know helped fuel a massive uh demand

48
00:02:04,890 --> 00:02:07,829
for people to you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know use those dollars</font>

49
00:02:07,829 --> 00:02:10,050
to go out and do some I also think that

50
00:02:10,050 --> 00:02:11,420
there was

51
00:02:11,420 --> 00:02:14,270
the things they kind of an unspoken uh

52
00:02:14,270 --> 00:02:16,459
thing that happened this year's with all

53
00:02:16,459 --> 00:02:17,810
the unemployment happening people

54
00:02:17,810 --> 00:02:20,120
weren't starting new businesses so money

55
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:22,550
that could have been you know put into

56
00:02:22,550 --> 00:02:24,500
somebody you know founding a new company

57
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:27,140
uh instead just went<font color="#E5E5E5"> into the stock</font>

58
00:02:27,140 --> 00:02:29,420
market I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> that helps do it too so</font>

59
00:02:29,420 --> 00:02:30,590
let's not real<font color="#E5E5E5"> quickly what do you think</font>

60
00:02:30,590 --> 00:02:32,630
the what what's the consensus now and

61
00:02:32,630 --> 00:02:35,330
what everyone so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is now seems lazy</font>

62
00:02:35,330 --> 00:02:37,850
see<font color="#CCCCCC"> yeah</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it seems to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that there's</font>

63
00:02:37,850 --> 00:02:41,840
we're gonna have a few more up months

64
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:44,150
and then sometime in the mid you know it

65
00:02:44,150 --> 00:02:47,750
depends the the more aggressive bear say

66
00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:50,090
you know Oh it'll be first quarter you

67
00:02:50,090 --> 00:02:52,340
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> sometime then things will drop off</font>

68
00:02:52,340 --> 00:02:54,110
some people say no no the rally will ask

69
00:02:54,110 --> 00:02:56,209
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the summer yeah everybody believes in</font>

70
00:02:56,209 --> 00:02:58,069
a million research reports and like

71
00:02:58,069 --> 00:02:59,450
things<font color="#E5E5E5"> will be good</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for a while with a</font>

72
00:02:59,450 --> 00:03:01,459
few more months and then the tightening

73
00:03:01,459 --> 00:03:03,200
will begin right and<font color="#CCCCCC"> Ben Bernanke's</font>

74
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:04,580
going to have to act to stave off

75
00:03:04,580 --> 00:03:06,530
inflation that's gonna kick right it'll

76
00:03:06,530 --> 00:03:09,319
either be<font color="#E5E5E5"> net Bernanke a foreign crisis</font>

77
00:03:09,319 --> 00:03:10,880
you know there that the causes are over

78
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:13,390
determined but everybody thinks<font color="#CCCCCC"> sometime</font>

79
00:03:13,390 --> 00:03:16,549
2010 and of<font color="#CCCCCC"> course everyone thinks</font>

80
00:03:16,549 --> 00:03:18,019
they're gonna be smart enough to sell

81
00:03:18,019 --> 00:03:19,430
when that happens right you know cuz

82
00:03:19,430 --> 00:03:21,079
there's no these classes like well we

83
00:03:21,079 --> 00:03:22,730
know are a little bit of<font color="#E5E5E5"> a bubble or</font>

84
00:03:22,730 --> 00:03:24,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">something but you have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to keep riding it</font>

85
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:26,450
out just<font color="#E5E5E5"> the key to make sure that you</font>

86
00:03:26,450 --> 00:03:28,850
definitely sell right what they say yeah

87
00:03:28,850 --> 00:03:30,560
we might be slightly<font color="#E5E5E5"> early gonna be you</font>

88
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:31,940
know is if there really are going to

89
00:03:31,940 --> 00:03:33,170
ring a bell and it's gonna be<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

90
00:03:33,170 --> 00:03:35,180
obvious right<font color="#CCCCCC"> exactly that that it'll</font>

91
00:03:35,180 --> 00:03:36,590
just happen I mean what will really

92
00:03:36,590 --> 00:03:39,230
happen is the market will do some will

93
00:03:39,230 --> 00:03:41,359
do<font color="#E5E5E5"> something again that nobody expects</font>

94
00:03:41,359 --> 00:03:43,640
either it will keep going up and it will

95
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:45,739
again be<font color="#CCCCCC"> the most hated Rhett the second</font>

96
00:03:45,739 --> 00:03:48,140
most hated rally ever or it will start

97
00:03:48,140 --> 00:03:50,120
to go down too early for people and

98
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:51,890
they'll say oh well but this isn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

99
00:03:51,890 --> 00:03:53,450
downturn<font color="#E5E5E5"> yeah right this is you know</font>

100
00:03:53,450 --> 00:03:55,430
don't get out<font color="#CCCCCC"> now because</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's going to</font>

101
00:03:55,430 --> 00:03:58,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">go up a little more and it what what all</font>

102
00:03:58,220 --> 00:03:59,569
this proves is that people<font color="#E5E5E5"> who think</font>

103
00:03:59,569 --> 00:04:01,880
that they can time the stock market but

104
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:03,380
they know the direction it's going to go

105
00:04:03,380 --> 00:04:05,840
over any short-term period are just

106
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:08,810
wrong nobody<font color="#E5E5E5"> gets it right and it's</font>

107
00:04:08,810 --> 00:04:10,579
<font color="#E5E5E5">probably you know this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is a great lesson</font>

108
00:04:10,579 --> 00:04:13,130
in that for the investors everywhere to

109
00:04:13,130 --> 00:04:15,049
learn and then real quickly just sort of

110
00:04:15,049 --> 00:04:16,639
what you know what let's talk about a

111
00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:19,029
<font color="#E5E5E5">few of the big risks for I mean I think</font>

112
00:04:19,029 --> 00:04:21,589
sovereign defaults is a huge risk has

113
00:04:21,589 --> 00:04:23,300
become in like the last two weeks<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's</font>

114
00:04:23,300 --> 00:04:24,320
all anyone right

115
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:26,150
well it started with Dubai right and

116
00:04:26,150 --> 00:04:28,250
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> focused everybody's attention now</font>

117
00:04:28,250 --> 00:04:29,690
we're really saying<font color="#E5E5E5"> Greece but you have</font>

118
00:04:29,690 --> 00:04:33,860
spain italy the these countries near

119
00:04:33,860 --> 00:04:35,690
large bodies of water<font color="#CCCCCC"> i guess you know i</font>

120
00:04:35,690 --> 00:04:38,170
well I guess that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> all countries but</font>

121
00:04:38,170 --> 00:04:42,200
you you<font color="#E5E5E5"> really want to right now there's</font>

122
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:43,910
this very strong chance because one

123
00:04:43,910 --> 00:04:45,350
<font color="#CCCCCC">thing that governments did very poorly</font>

124
00:04:45,350 --> 00:04:48,350
during the boom years was put in any

125
00:04:48,350 --> 00:04:50,090
fiscal discipline they all had deficit

126
00:04:50,090 --> 00:04:52,430
spending when their economies were going

127
00:04:52,430 --> 00:04:54,500
great<font color="#E5E5E5"> so once the economy started to</font>

128
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:56,500
tank and they had to ramp up the debt

129
00:04:56,500 --> 00:05:00,160
that is it has become you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> a sort of</font>

130
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:03,800
destruction and a massive economic scale

131
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:05,630
and there's no way for them to get out

132
00:05:05,630 --> 00:05:09,200
<font color="#CCCCCC">of it so I i think the sovereign debt is</font>

133
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:11,270
probably one of the big<font color="#CCCCCC"> crisis is the</font>

134
00:05:11,270 --> 00:05:12,920
other will be accounting scandals we're

135
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:14,120
going to have a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> more accounting</font>

136
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:16,100
scandals and that also tends to SAP

137
00:05:16,100 --> 00:05:18,590
confidence in markets you know it's the

138
00:05:18,590 --> 00:05:20,300
<font color="#CCCCCC">old Warren Buffett line when the tide</font>

139
00:05:20,300 --> 00:05:22,190
goes out you<font color="#E5E5E5"> see who's been swimming</font>

140
00:05:22,190 --> 00:05:24,950
naked I think we're not going to see

141
00:05:24,950 --> 00:05:26,540
accounting scandals justing companies

142
00:05:26,540 --> 00:05:29,390
but entire countries we don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> know sort</font>

143
00:05:29,390 --> 00:05:32,750
of how the chinese gdp how accurate is

144
00:05:32,750 --> 00:05:34,640
that calculated<font color="#E5E5E5"> in right if we start to</font>

145
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:35,990
get some indications that those things

146
00:05:35,990 --> 00:05:38,300
are phony investors may panic pull their

147
00:05:38,300 --> 00:05:40,520
money out<font color="#E5E5E5"> and we may have nation states</font>

148
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:43,250
turn into Enron or World Cup let's hope
