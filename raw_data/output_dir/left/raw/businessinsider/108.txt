1
00:00:08,180 --> 00:00:09,180
- I'm Sebastian Rotella.

2
00:00:09,180 --> 00:00:11,350
I'm the author of the novel Rip Crew

3
00:00:11,350 --> 00:00:13,710
and I'm a senior reporter at Propublica.

4
00:00:13,710 --> 00:00:16,160
Sicario was a, was a good movie, and some

5
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:18,040
of the things it portrayed
were very accurate,

6
00:00:18,040 --> 00:00:20,280
for example that shootout at the border,

7
00:00:20,280 --> 00:00:21,970
if you remember in Sicario when they're

8
00:00:21,970 --> 00:00:23,800
at the border crossing, stuck in traffic,

9
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:25,772
that has happened, and something
that I was very worried

10
00:00:25,772 --> 00:00:27,300
about when I was covering the border,

11
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:28,650
because you know that is a sort

12
00:00:28,650 --> 00:00:31,150
of a prime vulnerability moment

13
00:00:31,150 --> 00:00:32,604
when you're stuck in that
traffic at the border.

14
00:00:32,604 --> 00:00:35,410
There were other things
in, for example, in Sicario

15
00:00:35,410 --> 00:00:37,707
that I thought pushed the envelope,

16
00:00:37,707 --> 00:00:42,030
the sort of gratuitous and
casual torture taking place

17
00:00:42,030 --> 00:00:45,170
on US territory, that in
my experience, you know,

18
00:00:45,170 --> 00:00:47,820
it happens very rarely,
I'm really not aware of it.

19
00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:49,970
And that isn't because there aren't

20
00:00:49,970 --> 00:00:52,058
particularly Latin
American law enforcement

21
00:00:52,058 --> 00:00:54,390
and intelligence and military units

22
00:00:54,390 --> 00:00:56,880
that work with the US that
engage in that kind of activity,

23
00:00:56,880 --> 00:00:59,470
but it tends to happen
precisely in those countries.

24
00:00:59,470 --> 00:01:01,410
You know, the idea that
you would bring someone

25
00:01:01,410 --> 00:01:03,870
into the US to do that and expose yourself

26
00:01:03,870 --> 00:01:07,130
to all kinds of potential
prosecution and scandal,

27
00:01:07,130 --> 00:01:08,780
that did not ring true, for example.

28
00:01:08,780 --> 00:01:10,080
So it really depends.

29
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:12,510
I think Narcos is quite well-researched.

30
00:01:12,510 --> 00:01:15,970
What happens is, and I've done
this having written fiction,

31
00:01:15,970 --> 00:01:18,420
and having been involved
in projects where you move

32
00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:20,030
this stuff to the big screen,

33
00:01:20,030 --> 00:01:21,220
things have to be simplified,

34
00:01:21,220 --> 00:01:23,190
they have to be made dramatic,

35
00:01:23,190 --> 00:01:25,230
they have, you lose nuance,

36
00:01:25,230 --> 00:01:29,524
and oftentimes, they'll be
things that happen in real life

37
00:01:29,524 --> 00:01:31,780
that I think would make for good,

38
00:01:31,780 --> 00:01:34,260
it would be good on, on
a TV show or a movie,

39
00:01:34,260 --> 00:01:36,100
but they're harder to
portray because oftentimes

40
00:01:36,100 --> 00:01:38,410
they happen out of ineptitude.

41
00:01:38,410 --> 00:01:40,740
Right, I mean the scary
thing sometimes about

42
00:01:40,740 --> 00:01:42,860
this world is the combination of that,

43
00:01:42,860 --> 00:01:46,730
how lethal, but sometimes how
inept or how unsophisticated

44
00:01:46,730 --> 00:01:47,940
some of these actors are,

45
00:01:47,940 --> 00:01:50,690
that factor that is hard to
portray in the best series

46
00:01:50,690 --> 00:01:52,640
this question of ineptitude of the mix

47
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:56,860
of sophistication and coincidence and

48
00:01:56,860 --> 00:01:58,880
sort of human flaws,

49
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:00,123
I think when that is draw out in series,

50
00:02:00,123 --> 00:02:01,680
that is when they're at their best,

51
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:02,890
because I think that is very human

52
00:02:02,890 --> 00:02:04,280
and that is very real.

53
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:08,910
There is still a sense of
the drug lords in Mexico.

54
00:02:08,910 --> 00:02:10,590
You know people talk a
lot about Chapo Guzman,

55
00:02:10,590 --> 00:02:11,780
who was just captured.

56
00:02:11,780 --> 00:02:13,530
The thing about Chapo
Guzman is he was kind of

57
00:02:13,530 --> 00:02:16,260
the last of the drug lords of his style,

58
00:02:16,260 --> 00:02:19,430
and one of the reasons
that Mexico was so violent,

59
00:02:19,430 --> 00:02:21,520
and the drug violence and drug corruption

60
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:23,261
has gotten so bad is precisely because

61
00:02:23,261 --> 00:02:26,880
the generation of drug
lords like Chapo Guzman

62
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:28,260
has kind of died out,

63
00:02:28,260 --> 00:02:30,620
and the people who run
most of the cartels now,

64
00:02:30,620 --> 00:02:33,670
the cartels are adamized and
fragmented for one thing.

65
00:02:33,670 --> 00:02:35,840
And the other thing is what
you have is a phenomenon,

66
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:39,330
is as the drug lords like
Chapo Guzman have faded out,

67
00:02:39,330 --> 00:02:41,210
the trigger men, the
gun men, who pretty much

68
00:02:41,210 --> 00:02:43,870
resolve everything through
violence have risen.

69
00:02:43,870 --> 00:02:46,090
So it's not to say that Chapo Guzman

70
00:02:46,090 --> 00:02:47,740
and the Arellano-Felix brothers

71
00:02:47,740 --> 00:02:49,908
whom I covered in Tijuana
years ago and others,

72
00:02:49,908 --> 00:02:51,220
weren't violent.

73
00:02:51,220 --> 00:02:52,891
They were bloodthirsty and sadistic,

74
00:02:52,891 --> 00:02:57,130
but they also had a
sense of when to corrupt,

75
00:02:57,130 --> 00:02:58,290
rather than kill,

76
00:02:58,290 --> 00:03:00,360
when to do packs, when to,

77
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:01,930
how to, how to, how to approach this as a,

78
00:03:01,930 --> 00:03:03,360
as a business, as a violent business,

79
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:05,850
but a business, none the less.

80
00:03:05,850 --> 00:03:08,350
Whereas the drug cartels like the Zetas,

81
00:03:08,350 --> 00:03:10,680
and some of the remnants of other cartels

82
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:12,443
that have risen, the Zetas
were former commandos

83
00:03:12,443 --> 00:03:15,870
in Mexico actually military
men who took over and created

84
00:03:15,870 --> 00:03:16,970
their own cartel.

85
00:03:16,970 --> 00:03:19,400
Pretty much they resolve
everything through violence,

86
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:22,130
so people think about a drug lord

87
00:03:22,130 --> 00:03:23,580
sort of sitting on a throne somewhere

88
00:03:23,580 --> 00:03:25,960
and running this vast empire

89
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:27,713
and it's much more a series of smaller,

90
00:03:27,713 --> 00:03:31,710
very anarchic, dangerous, chaotic empires,

91
00:03:31,710 --> 00:03:33,810
that are, you know, that
have been splintered

92
00:03:33,810 --> 00:03:36,380
and fractured and that unfortunately has

93
00:03:36,380 --> 00:00:00,000
created more violence and not less.
