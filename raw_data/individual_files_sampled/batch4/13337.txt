on Monday BuzzFeed headlined these eight men owned as much wealth as half the world this vital bit of information came with this supporting facts courtesy of BuzzFeed special correspondent James ball and UK editorial developer Chris Applegate quote the world's eight richest men are worth four hundred and twenty six billion dollars the world's poorest three point seven billion people together own 409 billion dollars seventeen billion dollars less these statistics came courtesy of Oxfam BuzzFeed tuts quote the finding sheds stark light on the scale of inequality across the world with the figures also revealing that the wealthiest 1% of the population together own more than the remaining 99 percent combined the eight men who own as much as half the world are Microsoft founder Bill Gates Zara founder Amancio Ortega u2 US investor Warren Buffett Carlos Slim Hilo owner of Mexican conglomerate grupo Carso Amazon founder Jeff Bezos Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison and businessman and former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg Oxfam which routinely stumps for global redistribution ISM be wailed the health divided the wealth divide said quote well one in nine people on the planet will go to bed hungry tonight a small handful of billionaires have so much wealth they would need several lifetimes suspended the fact that a super rich elite are able to prosper at the expense of the rest of us at home and overseas shows how warped our economy has become inequality is not only keeping millions of people trapped in poverty it is fracturing our societies and poisoning our politics first off there is no indicator anywhere in this report that the wealth of the world's eight wealthiest men was ill-gotten there is no record of them enslaving people or robbing banks or burning down rival businesses the reason these people are rich is because they have founded businesses that created better products and services and engaged in more consensual transactions than and the other people on planet earth Bill Gates's Microsoft's created repeated at twelve thousand millionaires among his employees Microsoft currently employs more than a hundred thousand people Microsoft employees have been given one have given more than 1 billion dollars to charity Microsoft products have made millions of lives easier and better and millions of businesses cheaper to run the same is true for Amazon one of the world's great companies certainly as a consumer I benefit from Amazon every single day it's true Zara my wife loves it's for a facebook it's from Oracle among others where exactly is the great sin Oxfam's implication seems to be that wealth belongs to the collective and we must therefore reallocate it hence their language about a super-rich elite prospering at our expense but these rich people aren't prospering at the expense of others since 1981 the global extreme poverty rate has been sliced in half meanwhile from 1979 to 2014 the upper-middle class in America grew from 12% of the population to 30% of the population America's poor are doing better than the middle class in most places on earth thanks to the glories of free market economics and here's what Pew Research said in 2015 quote the u.s. stands head and shoulders above the rest of the world more than half 56% of Americans were high income by the global standard more than 32% were upper-middle income in other words almost 9 in 10 Americans had a standard of living that was above the global middle income standard only 7 percent of people in the United States were middle income 3% were low income and only 2% were poor the quest for income inequality is a fool's errand that's because the only way to rectify imbalances is to punish successful risk-taking the reason that investors make greater profits than those who do the actual work is because the investor takes the risk necessary in order to create a profit margin with which to pay those people Oxfam neglects to mention where the world's poorest people live according to the World Bank two-thirds of the world's poorest human beings live in India China Nigeria Bangladesh and Congo the Heritage Foundation index of economic freedom ranks these countries thusly in terms of their participation in free markets and their governmental dedication to rule of law and private property rights India ranks 120th Congo ranks 160 eighth China ranks 137 Nigeria ranks 129th Bangladesh ranks 130 first so Oxfam solution is to regulate markets more a richer world relies on freer markets both at home and abroad but the foolish inconsistent focus on income inequality merely provides cover for policies that actually enhance human suffering rather than mitigating it i'm ben shapiro this is the ben shapiro show so so glad that you could join us here on Martin Luther King Day a great day for America it's also a great day for me yesterday it was my birthday so who to me I'm now Christians

with all the birthday all the birthday paraphernalia put aside we can jump into jump into the news of the day so the big news of the day obviously its Martin Luther King Day and we will get to how Democrats are exploiting race because it's Martin Luther King Day but I want to start that with an article from guy named Oliver Thomas ok Oliver Thomas writes this piece for the for USA Today and the piece is totally not so the piece is titled this is why it's getting all sorts of attention the piece was titled White's killed MLK now we honor him ok so I wasn't there but what me OK my parents were around at that time one them in fact there were lots of white people around that time and it wasn't those people actually it was just like the guy who did it but what is this thing really about it's all about virtue signaling it's about virtue signaling so what the piece says is quote seems like every time dr. King showed up somewhere things got torn up or burned up so we killed him not me of course I'm not a racist but who thinks he is so we tried to fix it made his birthday a national holiday put him on a pedestal where we can honor him and he can't poke us in the eye this neglects a few kind of crucial issues with regard to the civil rights movement one lot of white Americans back the civil rights movement which is why it was successful it turns out that the black population of the United States is approximately 10% you know a lot of other race a lies in order to make a success if you are a minority group that's just the reality of politics ok second if you look at the faces in the Selma March pretty diverse group and it was Martin Luther King's recognition I'm like Malcolm X early Malcolm X it was Martin Luther King's recognition that you actually needed to work with people across the racial spectrum in order to move forward with individual civil rights that made him successful he was successful not just because he was a fantastic order and a really profound thinker and on racial matters but because he actually had the foresight to reach out to people who are not black as allies but today's civil rights leaders are not interested now Malcolm X actually won the the war I think Martin Luther King won the battle and Malcolm X won the war in a lot of ways because now we have racial polarization on all fronts not even late Malcolm X like after Malcolm X became an actual Muslim as opposed to a member of the Nation of Islam and and started talking about racial tolerance and then got shot for his trouble by the members of the Nation of Islam allegedly but like early Malcolm X like white Devils Malcolm X like there's a there's a certain resonance to that in today's politics that was supposed to be going on a while ago well so this white preacher there's this fellow Thomas Oliver Thomas he continues along these lines he says quote oh let tana he see Coates boil it down for you first of all you should never let tonic he see Coates boil down anything for you Tana he see Coates is a wildly overrated writer he's a wildly overrated thinker I mean I think the tiny he see Coates worldview can be summed up by the fact that he wrote in one of his pieces or in his book that he during 9/11 who's sitting on the top of his apartment building watching 9/11 happen and he didn't feel anything Tana heat c-code said quote white so this is a from Oliver Thomas white society was not achieved through wine tastings and ice cream socials but rather through the pillaging of life liberty labor and land insured through three centuries of kidnapping torture murder and rape we built an entire society on these bruised and broken backs that and countless Native Americans driven off their land I've been asked to speak in a Martin Luther King Day event me a white preacher speaking to a predominantly black audience filled with gifted preachers well here's the message no white person understands the black experience and this is what the left wants you to take away from Martin Luther King Day is that you should judge people by the color of their skin not the content of their character and we can never have a situation in which a little black child and a little white child hold hands and walk into the future together we can't have that because the black kid can't understand the white kid and mostly the white kid really can never understand the black head first of all this is just not factually true obviously we should rule Ament and to cry and remember the absolute evils of slavery and the horrors of Jim Crow but to suggest that American power was built on the back of slavery is economically illiterate illiterate and morally obtuse it really is slavery is not a an institution that benefits that benefit societies economically speaking it doesn't slavery is actually backwards this is one of the reasons why the north was wildly out competing the South during the Civil War I mean you would have imagined that the side with all the slaves would have won if slavery were all that great for the economy slavery is not good for the economy it turns out it turns out that wages are much better for the economy than slavery is so the idea that we built our economic power on the back of slavery is just not true we actually built our economic power in spite of slavery the great British Empire really became the great British Empire after outlawing slavery America got more powerful in spite of slavery we got more powerful in spite of Jim Crow not because of Jim Crow one of the things that a lot of the kind of revisionist racialist like to say is America only became powerful and wealthy because of Jim Crow are you kidding it turns out that taking 10% of your population and treating them like animals is not good for the economy it's not actually good for the economy you're losing all of the intellectual can forget about the moral issues involved forget about the moral evil of that you're losing all the intellectual capital you're losing all the hard work you're losing all the marketable skills the Constitution in the United States is great not because it enshrined slavery permanently but because it was a step toward abolishing slavery that's what the Constitution was designed to do when you hear people talk about the three-fifths law and how racist the three-fifths law was the whole purpose of the three-fifths law in the Constitution the whole purpose of the three-fifths provision is because the North did not want the south to be able to vote for continuing slavery by counting slaves as citizens for purposes of allocation of votes they came up with this compromise so they could actually actually have a functional country but the purpose of the three-fifths clause was partially to get rid of slavery the Declaration of Independence as Frederick Douglas made clear was not because it was particularly white people but because it was universal Frederick Douglas was very passionate about the Declaration of Independence so all of this is just historically not true but it's the message of it that's really gross so Martin Luther King did and the reason that you know you're proud to show videos of Martin Luther King to your kids my daughter is a little too young to understand it she's only just turning 3 next week but as soon as she's old enough to understand I'm gonna be proud and honored to show her speeches of Martin Luther King and at the at the march on Washington because King appealed to our common humanity's individual human beings the the fact that we could understand the black experience even if we could never fully experience it we can never fully experience what anyone else in society is going through I can't live somebody else's experience that's not possible but I can understand I can empathize with what they're going through and that allows me to realize I can think about what it would be like if I were they and then I can figure out what exactly what exactly to do about that that's the whole point common understanding is necessary in order to care anything if you're starting from the point of I can never understand you that actually leads to more tribalism not less tribalism why would I care about somebody I can't understand if the species of alien came down and there was no way to understand them would that generate more sympathy or less sympathy the whole purpose of establishing lines of communication is to understand each other better this is counterproductive racially Martin Luther King's whole shtick his whole spiel was that individual decency Trump's group grievance particularly for white folks like white folks can't do this group grievance routine against black folks they actually have to treat black folks as individuals and black folks likewise have to treat white folks as individuals so saying that all whites killed Martin Luther King is just as inane as saying all Democrats killed Martin Luther King it's just as inane and saying all Muslims are responsible for every terror attack it's silly it's counterproductive it doesn't actually establish the ties that need to happen in order to in order to achieve beyond which Islam is actually a philosophy white is not a philosophy it's a color and the fact is the Civil Rights Act was passed by a bunch of white people the fact is Jim Crow was ended by a bunch of white people yes it took black leadership to do that thank God for the black leaders thank God for people like John Willis we'll get to in a second but that doesn't mean that it didn't take a coalition of people across racial lines in order to reach success I mean if you want racial reconciliation the reason that Martin Luther King is a great figure and Malcolm X is not a great figure is because Malcolm X is Malcolm X's perspective on race is counterproductive and leads to polarization Martin Luther King's perspective on race is a deeply American one a uniquely American one and that's why we celebrate his birthday today now meanwhile Donald Trump has been elected president and of course that means it's time for the left to completely lose its freakin mind I mean they've gone completely nuts representative John Lewis led it off John Lewis of course was famous because he led the attempt to break a the segregated segregation in the south I was clubbed about the ears for his trouble and so real civil rights hero John Lewis but just because you know as I get older one of the things that I tend to realize is that there are no heroes there are no villains they're just people who do heroic things and people who do the Lennis things people are people are people but you can say if somebody is a saint you know over the course of their life then their sayings over the course of their life but a lot of people do heroic things also say stupid things a lot of people who do really villainous things also do good things and it's easier as a human being to label action rather than to label people I'll say that John Lewis was a civil rights hero he did very heroic things during the civil rights struggle that does not mean he's anywhere close to right on what he's about to say about Donald Trump here I don't see this president-elect has a legitimate president you do not consider him a legitimate president why is that I think the Russians participated in helping this man get elected and they helped destroyed the candidacy or Hillary Clinton I don't plan to attend a inauguration it would be the first one that I miss since I've been in Congress you cannot be at home with something that you feel that is wrong that's gonna send out it's gonna send a big message to a lot of people in this country that you don't believe he's a legitimate president I think there was a conspiracy on the part of the Russians in others to help him get a liked it that's not right that's not fair that's not open democratic process okay so you know whatever you think of the Russian interference in the election the fact is there is a legitimate vote held based on the information that was available to the public and Hillary Clinton lost so John Lewis is wrong here so Donald Trump naturally goes to Twitter to respond manure his tweets Congressman John Lewis should spend more time on fixing and helping his district which is in horrible shape and falling apart not to mention crime-infested rather than falsely complaining about the election results all talk talk talk no action or results sad hey there's that typical Trump sad with the exclamation point Congressman John Lewis should finally focus on the burning and crime-infested inner cities of the US I can use all the help I can get so you know is this typically subtly worded Donald Trump no this is pretty typical trumpet not wrong about the fact that if this were reversed everybody on the Left would lose their mind right if this were somebody saying that Hillary Clinton were not illegitimate president in fact when Donald Trump said that Barack Obama was not a legitimate president that he was born outside the United States everybody rightly went nuts now everybody's getting on Trump for this and they're a bunch of people on the Left who said that that Trump was attacking John Lewis racially Nina Turner who's a commentator on on CNN former former Ohio state senator Nina Turner this is what she had to say about Donald Trump's response to John Lewis well he's Congressman John Lewis I just want to say that to make sure that we gave him the record requisite respect that he deserves and fifty years ago everything that he did is still important today now I as a Democrat we know that the Russians had some impact but they didn't go vote on Election Day they didn't mess with the electronic data so there are some Democrats to get that and they didn't write the emails Democrats are gonna have to wear that but at the same time what the president-elect needs to do this is not the apprentice the White House edition his tweets were insensitive for him to categorize congressman Trump excuse me congressman Lewis's district as as in bad shape prime investor crime and that's not by the way fortune 500 companies it's about 58% of house American right institutions of higher learning it is diverse ethnically and it is diverse economically so my memo to my to my to my white elected officials not just a president elect Trump but a light a lot of white elected officials make this mistake in making the African American community a very homogenious they read us the wrong way they think everybody's poor everybody's broken down that is not the truth so they need to come and visit some African American community she's implying that Trump is a racist because he said that Lewis's district was crime-infested and an in bad shape here are the actual facts about John Lewis's district is George's fifth congressional district as compared to the state average in the national average okay here is from the Census Bureau the unemployment rate in John Lewis's district out of 2015 was 8.2 percent the state average was 5.5 percent the national average was 5 percent so is there way higher unemployment in John Lewis district answer yes there is much higher unemployment in John Lewis's district okay when it looks at when you look at the poverty rate the poverty is seventeen point three percent in Georgia's fifth District it's seventeen percent state average 13.5 percent nationally a little bit higher than the state average a lot higher than the national average now there are some major businesses that are located in John Lewis's district but the the crime rates are also they are higher in John Lewis's district okay so Atlanta is located inside Lewis's district it had the fourteenth highest violent crime rate in the United States in 2015 with 1120 violent crimes per 100,000 residents which is triple the national average that's triple the national average okay so is Trump wildly wrong on all of this no Trump isn't wildly wrong on all of this should Louis be doing a better job for his district yes he should be doing a better job for his district does one thing have to do with another know it was it the way that I would have phrased it no but to claim that Trump is a big racist because he's pointing out that Louis's district isn't in the greatest shape ever that is a stretch by the way he would say the same thing about some white persons districts right if a white person had insulted him he'd have said exactly the same thing and you know he would if you're on the left you know Trump has no-holds-barred if you if you attack him in any way he is going to loose the hounds of Twitter on you and that means that he's gonna call your district crime ridden and it's gonna be like compared to Mad Max and and it'll just be Mel Gibson running through the Australian wasteland according to Donald Trump doesn't matter I mean Mel he said Meryl Streep was an overrated actress because she insulted him at the Golden Globes do you really think that if John Lewis were white he wouldn't have said the same thing it's just really silly all around but the left is really attempting now to push this notion that Donald Trump is an illegitimate president we'll talk about that a little bit more in just a second but first I have to open my second gift of the day I am so you guys you really wrapped it up beautifully here so thank you for that I'll never be able to guess what this is oh it's your resignations no it isn't no actually it's

Facebook and YouTube so the left is fully invested in calling Donald Trump illegitimate and the right seems very perturbed about this oh it's totally inappropriate for them to say it's illegitimate that Trump is illegitimate okay the left did it for years okay the the left isn't it you know they've been saying that they said Bush was illegitimate they said that they say that right now Trump is illegitimate every time a Republican is elected it's illegitimate right everything is he'll admit that the right does and it's it's now coming from both sides right Donald Trump said that Barack Obama was basically illegitimate Paul Krugman who just a week ago was saying that Republicans are alienating too many people in polarizing the political discourse wrote a column in which he said let's not talk about mr. Trump's ravings instead let's ask whether mr. Lewis was right to say what he said is it okay morally and politically to declare the man about to move into the White House illegitimate yes it is in fact it's an act of patriotism so now we're back in the space where dissent is the highest form of patriotism blah blah blah blah blah it's just amazing how the positions switch as soon as the shoes on the other foot as soon as Trump gets elected then it's fine to say that the president is illegitimate if the results had been exactly the same and Republicans had said Hillary is illegitimate she should have been running she's a criminal the left was a how dare you you accept her she's your president she's your president you accept that it's just amazing there is no penalty by the way for calling the president just on a political note it's actually beneficial we've reached the point in American politics where casting the other side's winners as illegitimate is actually a very useful tactic it really the left did this for george w bush for years and years and years nancy pelosi did it for years and years and years it was very successful for her donald trump did it for Barack Obama he was very successful for him I think this is just part of the new political discourse and we're all gonna have to get used to it he's calling the other side illegitimate no matter what the actual results now the only time I haven't seen that is with Obama 2012 to Obama 2012 I didn't see a lot of Obama is an illegitimate president from the right even though he had obviously lied about what happened in Benghazi in order to prop himself up at the end of the election cycle even though the media were obviously propping him up he was a legitimate president I didn't see a lot of that from the right but it's become sort of a ball to be batted around by both sides so none of this is particularly surprising Dianne Feinstein is also saying that Donald Trump is illegitimate because Russia interfered we've got a huge destruction of our system going on so we have to we have to be full and robust in this look and I trust that we are I have worked with chairman before a long time and I believe that this can happen if it doesn't we will sing out loud and clear let me buttonhole something though you said you believe that Russia's interference altered the outcome of the election I do I believe that nation of a couple of things I think that and I think the FBI in the October Surprise I call it an October Surprise of announcing a subsequent investigation did have an impact and I believe the Clinton Pizza invented to turn October Surprise who knew but yes so the Democrats are just gonna keep saying this the Democratic chair candidate is saying the same thing that Trump was allegedly elected we can we can play that as well he's truth-telling I don't think this is about just Democrats this is Americans anyone with a smidgen of common sense can remember Donald Trump looking in the camera encouraging Russia to hack into our electoral process cheerleading them on and the idea that whatever information these members of Congress are getting out of this classified briefing had them storm out of that room makes it very clear that the decisions that the FBI made that we runnin unprecedented to get involved in the election against Hillary Clinton pick a winner pick a loser when they had so much information that was so damaging what have we been talking about since this man was allegedly elected oh yeah how coming haulage of knowledge that he achieved the necessary electoral votes and is legitimately elected president United States would you not well I haven't seen the classified briefing that the member you and I won an election might be asking as we continue here on the bench Shapiro show is whether this is good strategy or not cuz there's a bit of a split opening up in the Democratic Party we also got to talk about Trump going out for SNL we got to talk about Trump on Obamacare we got to talk about Trump on NATO EU the intelligence community Trump on we have tons coming up like a lot and these these guys work really hard to cut all of this audio so you're gonna want to be around to as we
