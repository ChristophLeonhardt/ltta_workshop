15
00:00:06,499 --> 00:00:08,534
THAT IS THE FOCUS OF TONIGHT'S

16
00:00:08,534 --> 00:00:11,137
ANGLE.

17
00:00:11,137 --> 00:00:12,338
EVERY COUNTRY HAS AN OBLIGATION

18
00:00:12,338 --> 00:00:14,940
TO PROTECT ITS BORDERS AND ITS

19
00:00:14,940 --> 00:00:16,942
CITIZENS, PARTICULARLY ONE AS

20
00:00:16,942 --> 00:00:18,577
EXTENSIVE AND GENEROUS AS THE

21
00:00:18,577 --> 00:00:19,945
UNITED STATES.

22
00:00:19,945 --> 00:00:21,247
FOR TOO LONG, IMMIGRATION LAW

23
00:00:21,247 --> 00:00:23,182
WAS IGNORED FRANKLY AND

24
00:00:23,182 --> 00:00:25,384
BASICALLY UNENFORCED.

25
00:00:25,384 --> 00:00:27,119
OBAMA TRIED TO KIND OF ENFORCE

26
00:00:27,119 --> 00:00:29,188
IT IN AN AD HOC FASHION BUT THE

27
00:00:29,188 --> 00:00:31,724
POLICIES WHICH I WILL GET TO A

28
00:00:31,724 --> 00:00:33,392
NEW MOMENT ONLY ENDED UP

29
00:00:33,392 --> 00:00:34,326
EXACERBATING OUR PROBLEMS

30
00:00:34,727 --> 00:00:35,327
AT THE BORDER.

31
00:00:35,327 --> 00:00:38,764
TODAY WE HAVE A FULL ON CRISIS.

32
00:00:38,764 --> 00:00:41,133
160% INCREASE THE NUMBER OF

33
00:00:41,133 --> 00:00:41,967
PEOPLE ILLEGALLY ENTERING THE

34
00:00:41,967 --> 00:00:44,136
UNITED STATES FROM JUST LAST

35
00:00:44,136 --> 00:00:45,171
YEAR.

36
00:00:45,171 --> 00:00:47,139
WHILE, THE PRESIDENT IS

37
00:00:47,139 --> 00:00:49,074
RESPONDING WITH A ZERO TOLERANCE

38
00:00:49,074 --> 00:00:51,677
MESSAGE WHICH SHE REITERATED

39
00:00:51,677 --> 00:00:51,977
TODAY.

40
00:00:51,977 --> 00:00:53,979
>> THE UNITED STATES WILL NOT BE

41
00:00:53,979 --> 00:00:59,518
A MIGRANT CAMP, AND IT WILL NOT

42
00:00:59,518 --> 00:01:00,820
BE A REFUGEE HOLDING FACILITY.

43
00:01:00,820 --> 00:01:03,722
IT WON'T BE.

44
00:01:03,722 --> 00:01:04,489
YOU LOOK AT WHAT'S HAPPENING IN

45
00:01:04,489 --> 00:01:04,956
EUROPE.

46
00:01:04,956 --> 00:01:06,392
YOU LOOK AT WHAT'S HAPPENING IN

47
00:01:06,392 --> 00:01:07,359
OTHER PLACES.

48
00:01:07,359 --> 00:01:08,327
WE CAN'T ALLOW THAT TO HAPPEN TO

49
00:01:08,327 --> 00:01:11,230
THE UNITED STATES, NOT ON MY

50
00:01:11,230 --> 00:01:12,131
WATCH.

51
00:01:12,131 --> 00:01:12,832
>> Laura: NOW, THE PRESIDENT

52
00:01:12,832 --> 00:01:16,769
IS NOT DOING -- NOW DOING WHAT E

53
00:01:16,769 --> 00:01:18,938
SHOULD'VE BEEN DOING ALL

54
00:01:18,938 --> 00:01:20,272
ALONG, PROSECUTING ALL BORDER

55
00:01:20,272 --> 00:01:20,639
CRUSHERS.

56
00:01:20,639 --> 00:01:21,941
IF YOUR ENTER THE COUNTRY

57
00:01:21,941 --> 00:01:23,642
ILLEGALLY YOU ARE BREAKING THE

58
00:01:23,642 --> 00:01:24,610
LAW FOR THE UNITED STATES IS NOT

59
00:01:24,610 --> 00:01:28,814
AN OPEN RAPACIOUS AND CENTER

60
00:01:28,814 --> 00:01:30,683
WERE ANY INDIGENOUS PERSON IN

61
00:01:30,683 --> 00:01:33,519
THE WORLD ASSUMES WE WILL TAKE

62
00:01:33,519 --> 00:01:34,286
CARE OF THEM AND THEIR

63
00:01:34,286 --> 00:01:34,653
FAMILIES.

64
00:01:34,653 --> 00:01:37,256
THERE IS A PROCESS AND IT HAS TO

65
00:01:37,256 --> 00:01:38,324
BE RESPECTED.

66
00:01:38,324 --> 00:01:40,259
HOMELAND SECURITY CHIEF KIRSTJEN

67
00:01:40,259 --> 00:01:41,193
NIELSEN SAID THIS TODAY.

68
00:01:41,193 --> 00:01:43,696
>> WE ARE A COMPASSIONATE

69
00:01:43,696 --> 00:01:45,731
COUNTRY THAT HAS TAKEN IN

70
00:01:45,731 --> 00:01:47,766
MILLIONS OF REFUGEES.

71
00:01:47,766 --> 00:01:48,767
SINCE 1975, THE UNITED STATES

72
00:01:48,767 --> 00:01:50,603
HAS WELCOMED MORE THAN 3 MILLION

73
00:01:50,603 --> 00:01:52,304
REFUGEES FROM ALL OVER THE WORLD

74
00:01:52,304 --> 00:01:52,872
REFUGEES FROM ALL OVER THE WORL

75
00:01:52,872 --> 00:01:53,339
WORLD.

76
00:01:53,339 --> 00:01:54,773
AND EACH YEAR, TYPICALLY ADMITS

77
00:01:54,773 --> 00:01:59,945
NEARLY TWO-THIRDS OF THE WORLD

78
00:01:59,945 --> 00:02:00,946
SETTLED REFUGEES.

79
00:02:00,946 --> 00:02:03,716
THAT IS MORE THAN ALL OTHER

80
00:02:03,716 --> 00:02:04,250
COUNTRIES COMBINED.

81
00:02:04,250 --> 00:02:05,718
WE WILL NOT APOLOGIZE FOR THE

82
00:02:05,718 --> 00:02:08,954
JOB WE DO OR FOR THE JOB

83
00:02:08,954 --> 00:02:09,687
LAW ENFORCEMENT DOES FOR DOING

84
00:02:09,687 --> 00:02:11,790
THE JOB THAT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE

85
00:02:11,790 --> 00:02:13,926
EXPECT US TO DO.

86
00:02:13,926 --> 00:02:16,662
ILLEGAL ACTIONS HAVE AND MUST

87
00:02:16,662 --> 00:02:19,331
HAVE CONS WITH THIS.

88
00:02:19,331 --> 00:02:20,132
NO MORE FREE PASSES.

89
00:02:20,132 --> 00:02:22,334
NO MORE GET-OUT-OF-JAIL-FREE

90
00:02:22,334 --> 00:02:23,936
CARDS.

91
00:02:23,936 --> 00:02:24,737
>> Laura: CONSISTENT WITH

92
00:02:24,737 --> 00:02:27,673
AMERICAN LAW WHEN THE PARTIES

93
00:02:27,673 --> 00:02:28,340
ARRESTED, YOUR CHILDREN ARE

94
00:02:28,340 --> 00:02:30,376
EITHER SENT TO RELATIVES OR THEY

95
00:02:30,376 --> 00:02:33,379
BECOME WARDS OF THE STATE.

96
00:02:33,379 --> 00:02:34,546
SINCE MORE ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS

97
00:02:34,546 --> 00:02:35,781
ARE RUSHING THE PARTICLE OR MORE

98
00:02:35,781 --> 00:02:37,917
KIDS ARE BEING SEPARATED FROM

99
00:02:37,917 --> 00:02:38,384
THEIR PARENTS.

100
00:02:38,384 --> 00:02:39,118
AND TEMPORARILY HOUSED IN WHAT

101
00:02:39,118 --> 00:02:41,887
ARE ESSENTIALLY SUMMER CAMPS OR,

102
00:02:41,887 --> 00:02:44,423
AS THE "SAN DIEGO UNION TRIBUNE"

103
00:02:44,423 --> 00:02:46,058
ASCRIBED THEM TO MAKE HIM AS

104
00:02:46,058 --> 00:02:47,159
LOOKING LIKE BASICALLY BOARDING

105
00:02:47,159 --> 00:02:48,460
SCHOOLS.

106
00:02:48,460 --> 00:02:49,428
HAVING LOST THE ARGUMENT AND

107
00:02:49,428 --> 00:02:51,497
FRANKLY THE LAST ELECTION,

108
00:02:51,497 --> 00:02:53,666
LIBERALS HAVE SEIZED ON THE

109
00:02:53,666 --> 00:02:56,468
SEPARATED CHILDREN AND TURNED

110
00:02:56,468 --> 00:02:58,871
THE ENTIRE IMAGE INTO A

111
00:02:58,871 --> 00:02:59,371
POLITICAL WEAPON.

112
00:02:59,371 --> 00:03:00,339
ATTEMPTING TO EMOTIONALLY

113
00:03:00,339 --> 00:03:01,507
MUTILATE THE PUBLIC'S PERCEPTION

114
00:03:01,507 --> 00:03:03,943
OF IMMIGRATION ENFORCEMENT.

115
00:03:03,943 --> 00:03:06,245
>> I HAVE READ THAT YOU SAID

116
00:03:06,245 --> 00:03:07,313
THAT THE SEPARATION, AND YOUR

117
00:03:07,313 --> 00:03:09,281
WORDS TO ME SAID IT'S NOTHING

118
00:03:09,281 --> 00:03:10,015
LESS THAN GOVERNMENT SANCTIONED

119
00:03:10,015 --> 00:03:12,384
CHILD ABUSE.

120
00:03:12,384 --> 00:03:13,585
DO YOU REALLY THINK THIS AMOUNTS

121
00:03:13,585 --> 00:03:15,955
TO CHILD ABUSE?

122
00:03:15,955 --> 00:03:17,456
>> THIS DOES AMOUNT TO CHILD

123
00:03:17,456 --> 00:03:17,957
ABUSE.

124
00:03:17,957 --> 00:03:19,358
ALL I CAN SAY AFTER TALKING TO

125
00:03:19,358 --> 00:03:21,961
THE PEOPLE, WATCHING THE PEOPLE,

126
00:03:21,961 --> 00:03:23,696
LISTENING TO THE PEOPLE THAT THE

127
00:03:23,696 --> 00:03:24,763
STATUE OF LIBERTY I THINK IT'S

128
00:03:24,763 --> 00:03:26,765
WEEPING RIGHT NOW.

129
00:03:26,765 --> 00:03:27,967
>> EFFECTIVELY ORPHANED

130
00:03:27,967 --> 00:03:28,734
THOUSANDS OF CHILDREN FROM THEIR

131
00:03:28,734 --> 00:03:29,201
PARENTS.

132
00:03:29,201 --> 00:03:30,869
>> I AM HEARTBROKEN BY WHAT'S

133
00:03:30,869 --> 00:03:31,971
HAPPENING, AND I WONDER WHAT

134
00:03:31,971 --> 00:03:33,038
THIS MEANS ABOUT THE FABRIC OF

135
00:03:33,038 --> 00:03:37,276
OUR COUNTRY.

136
00:03:37,276 --> 00:03:39,545
>> NOW, WHY ARE ALL THEIR

137
00:03:39,545 --> 00:03:41,146
HEARTS BREAKING IN UNISON NOW?

138
00:03:41,146 --> 00:03:43,949
WHY NO TEARS FOR THE VICTIMS OF

139
00:03:43,949 --> 00:03:45,451
ILLEGAL IMMIGRANT CRIME LIKE THE

140
00:03:45,451 --> 00:03:51,123
14-YEAR-OLD GIRL RAPED JUST LAST

141
00:03:51,123 --> 00:03:51,423
MONTH.

142
00:03:51,423 --> 00:03:54,827
OR DID THEIR HEARTBREAK WHEN

143
00:03:54,827 --> 00:03:57,896
SOMEONE WAS LEFT TO DIE AT THE

144
00:03:57,896 --> 00:04:00,766
SCENE OF A HIT-AND-RUN BY

145
00:04:00,766 --> 00:04:01,467
21-YEAR-OLD MEXICAN NATIONAL?

146
00:04:01,467 --> 00:04:02,468
HERE IS WHAT YOU ARE NOT

147
00:04:02,468 --> 00:04:03,268
HEARING.

148
00:04:03,268 --> 00:04:03,969
THE GOVERNMENT HAS VERY GOOD

149
00:04:03,969 --> 00:04:05,337
REASON FOR SEPARATING THESE

150
00:04:05,337 --> 00:04:06,939
CHILDREN FROM THEIR FAMILY

151
00:04:06,939 --> 00:04:07,973
UNITS.

152
00:04:07,973 --> 00:04:09,008
THE FIRST BEING THEY MAY NOT BE

153
00:04:09,008 --> 00:04:12,378
THE CHILD'S FAMILY AT ALL.

154
00:04:12,378 --> 00:04:15,080
CHILDREN HAVE BEEN KIDNAPPED,

155
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:17,082
TRAFFIC, AND USED BY INDIVIDUALS

156
00:04:17,082 --> 00:04:18,649
WHO CAN MORE EASILY SLIP INTO

157
00:04:18,649 --> 00:04:19,351
THE COUNTRY.

158
00:04:19,351 --> 00:04:20,552
THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION'S CATCH

159
00:04:20,552 --> 00:04:22,955
AND RELEASE POLICY ALLOW PEOPLE

160
00:04:22,955 --> 00:04:25,157
WITH CHILDREN TO ENTER THE

161
00:04:25,157 --> 00:04:25,991
UNITED STATES WITH ONLY A

162
00:04:25,991 --> 00:04:28,193
PROMISE TO SHOW UP FOR A LATER

163
00:04:28,193 --> 00:04:28,527
HEARING.

164
00:04:28,527 --> 00:04:30,229
A LOT OF THEM DIDN'T SHOW UP OF

165
00:04:30,229 --> 00:04:30,763
COURSE.

166
00:04:30,763 --> 00:04:32,464
THE HUMAN TRAFFICKERS AND THE

167
00:04:32,464 --> 00:04:35,467
DRUG CARTELS QUICKLY SEIZED ON

168
00:04:35,467 --> 00:04:37,803
THE WEAKNESS AND EXPLOITED IT.

169
00:04:37,803 --> 00:04:39,338
ROUTINELY TRAFFICKING PEOPLE

170
00:04:39,338 --> 00:04:40,506
ACROSS THE BORDER USING CHILDREN

171
00:04:40,506 --> 00:04:45,144
AT TIMES AS CAMOUFLAGE.

172
00:04:45,144 --> 00:04:46,211
THEN WHEN OBAMA ANNOUNCED TO

173
00:04:46,211 --> 00:04:48,680
DACA POLICY IN 2012, IT BECAME

174
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:50,916
YET ANOTHER LORD FOR ILLEGAL

175
00:04:50,916 --> 00:04:52,951
IMMIGRANTS.

176
00:04:52,951 --> 00:04:54,386
THE NUMBER OF UNACCOMPANIED

177
00:04:54,386 --> 00:04:55,554
MINORS FROM EL SALVADOR,

178
00:04:55,554 --> 00:04:56,955
GUATEMALA, AND HONDURAS, SURGED

179
00:04:56,955 --> 00:04:59,158
BETWEEN 2012 AND 2014.

180
00:04:59,158 --> 00:05:00,626
CHECK THIS OUT.

181
00:05:00,626 --> 00:05:04,163
BY MORE THAN 400%.

182
00:05:04,163 --> 00:05:05,230
THE NUMBER OF UNACCOMPANIED

183
00:05:05,230 --> 00:05:05,964
CHILDREN REFER TO THE OFFICE OF

184
00:05:05,964 --> 00:05:09,501
REFUGEE RESETTLEMENT TRIPLED

185
00:05:09,501 --> 00:05:16,675

186
00:05:16,675 --> 00:05:19,111
13,625 TO 40,810, ACCORDING TO

187
00:05:19,111 --> 00:05:22,347
THE GOVERNMENT STATISTICS.

188
00:05:22,347 --> 00:05:23,315
FROM THESE IMMIGRANTS COME FRESH

189
00:05:23,315 --> 00:05:26,752
RECRUITS FOR MS-13 AND OTHER

190
00:05:26,752 --> 00:05:28,153
GANGS THAT TERRORIZED AMERICAN

191
00:05:28,153 --> 00:05:29,354
CITIES FROM MARYLAND TO

192
00:05:29,354 --> 00:05:30,155
CALIFORNIA.

193
00:05:30,155 --> 00:05:31,957
WE HAVE TALKED TO THE OFFICIALS.

194
00:05:31,957 --> 00:05:33,192
WE HAVE TOLD THE STORIES.

195
00:05:33,192 --> 00:05:36,161
IN JUNE OF 2014, EVEN

196
00:05:36,161 --> 00:05:37,162
"THE WASHINGTON POST" HAD TO

197
00:05:37,162 --> 00:05:39,198
ADMIT THAT THE UNACCOMPANIED

198
00:05:39,198 --> 00:05:41,767
MINOR SURGE WAS "DRIVEN IN LARGE

199
00:05:41,767 --> 00:05:43,368
PART BY THE PERCEPTION THAT THEY

200
00:05:43,368 --> 00:05:45,671
WILL BE ALLOWED TO STAY UNDER

201
00:05:45,671 --> 00:05:47,005
THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION'S

202
00:05:47,005 --> 00:05:49,341
IMMIGRATION POLICY."

203
00:05:49,341 --> 00:05:52,311
ASTOUNDINGLY IN THE FISCAL YEAR

204
00:05:52,311 --> 00:05:54,146
2014, THE BORDER PATROL

205
00:05:54,146 --> 00:05:58,350
APPREHENDED 68,445 "FAMILY

206
00:05:58,350 --> 00:06:02,087
UNITS."

207
00:06:02,087 --> 00:06:03,755
FEEL, OF COURSE, WERE DEPORTED.

208
00:06:03,755 --> 00:06:05,691
THROW IN SANCTUARY CITIES, A LAX

209
00:06:05,691 --> 00:06:08,594
AMNESTY PROGRAM, AND IT'S A

210
00:06:08,594 --> 00:06:10,762
WONDER MORE ILLEGALS HAVEN'T

211
00:06:10,762 --> 00:06:11,063
COME.

212
00:06:11,063 --> 00:06:12,464
SO THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION IS

213
00:06:12,464 --> 00:06:15,267
NOW TRYING TO PICK UP THE PIECES

214
00:06:15,267 --> 00:06:17,369
OF THIS LAWLESS IMMIGRATION

215
00:06:17,369 --> 00:06:18,470
SYSTEM AFTER DECADES OF

216
00:06:18,470 --> 00:06:19,571
GOVERNMENTAL NEGLECT.

217
00:06:19,571 --> 00:06:21,240
THEY ARE ALSO TRYING TO

218
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:21,974
RESPONSIBLY PROTECT CHILDREN IN

219
00:06:21,974 --> 00:06:23,942
THE GOVERNMENT'S CARE.

220
00:06:23,942 --> 00:06:25,444
HERE ARE THE CIRCUMSTANCES UNDER

221
00:06:25,444 --> 00:06:27,346
WHICH THEY TEMPORARILY TAKEN TO

222
00:06:27,346 --> 00:06:29,081
CUSTODY OF CHILDREN.

223
00:06:29,081 --> 00:06:31,617
NUMBER ONE, WHEN DHS IS UNABLE

224
00:06:31,617 --> 00:06:32,584
TO VERIFY THE RELATIONSHIP

225
00:06:32,584 --> 00:06:35,387
BETWEEN THE ADULT IN THE CHILD.

226
00:06:35,387 --> 00:06:36,688
NUMBER TWO, WHEN DHS DETERMINES

227
00:06:36,688 --> 00:06:38,790
THAT A CHILD MAY BE AT RISK WITH

228
00:06:38,790 --> 00:06:41,760
THE PARENT OR THE LEGAL

229
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:43,362
GUARDIAN, AND THREE, WITH A

230
00:06:43,362 --> 00:06:45,430
PARENT OR LEGAL GUARDIAN IS

231
00:06:45,430 --> 00:06:47,733
REFERRED FOR CRIMINAL

232
00:06:47,733 --> 00:06:48,934
PROSECUTION.

233
00:06:48,934 --> 00:06:51,303
YOU ENTER INTO A NORMAL PORT OF

234
00:06:51,303 --> 00:06:52,037
ENTRY RATHER THAN COMING ACROSS

235
00:06:52,037 --> 00:06:54,373
THE BORDER ILLEGALLY AND THE

236
00:06:54,373 --> 00:06:56,141
CHANCES ARE YOU'RE NOT GOING TO

237
00:06:56,141 --> 00:06:56,942
BE SEPARATED FROM THEIR

238
00:06:56,942 --> 00:06:57,342
FAMILIES.

239
00:06:57,342 --> 00:06:59,144
BUT MOST OF THESE PEOPLE ARE

240
00:06:59,144 --> 00:07:00,579
COMING STRAIGHT ACROSS THE

241
00:07:00,579 --> 00:07:02,147
BORDER AS ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS,

242
00:07:02,147 --> 00:07:03,415
THEN CLAIMING SOME TYPE OF

243
00:07:03,415 --> 00:07:05,951
STATUS OR ASYLUM REQUEST.

244
00:07:05,951 --> 00:07:08,654
THIS ALL GOES BACK TO A 1997

245
00:07:08,654 --> 00:07:10,088
COURT RULING WE'VE TALKED ABOUT

246
00:07:10,088 --> 00:07:12,324
BEFORE ON THE SHOW CALLED THE

247
00:07:12,324 --> 00:07:13,892
FLORIDA SETTLEMENT WHICH FORBADE

248
00:07:13,892 --> 00:07:16,195
THE GOVERNMENT FROM HOLDING

249
00:07:16,195 --> 00:07:16,862
UNACCOMPANIED CHILDREN FROM

250
00:07:16,862 --> 00:07:19,364
WITHIN 20 DAYS.

251
00:07:19,364 --> 00:07:21,266
FOR THOSE TRAVELING WITH FAMILY

252
00:07:21,266 --> 00:07:21,567
UNITS.

253
00:07:21,567 --> 00:07:24,536
YOU HAVE A HEARING WITHIN 20

254
00:07:24,536 --> 00:07:25,671
DAYS, THEY HAVE TO BE

255
00:07:25,671 --> 00:07:26,939
RELEASED INTO THE COUNTRY.

256
00:07:26,939 --> 00:07:28,674
LEST YOU CAN BE SWAYED BY THE

257
00:07:28,674 --> 00:07:29,942
MEDIA REPORTS THAT THE CHILDREN

258
00:07:29,942 --> 00:07:31,476
ARE HOUSED IN CONCENTRATION CAPS

259
00:07:31,476 --> 00:07:33,212
OR CAGES, THE TRUTH IS THE U.S.

260
00:07:33,212 --> 00:07:35,280
TAX PAPER IS SPENDING A LOT ON

261
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:38,917
THE CARE OF THESE CHILDREN.

262
00:07:38,917 --> 00:07:42,321
NEARLY $35,000 PER YEAR PER

263
00:07:42,321 --> 00:07:44,590
CHILD.

264
00:07:44,590 --> 00:07:46,959
THEY HAVE A HIGHER STANDARD OF

265
00:07:46,959 --> 00:07:50,095
LIVING WITHIN THE 13 MILLION

266
00:07:50,095 --> 00:07:50,696
AMERICAN CHILDREN TODAY

267
00:07:50,696 --> 00:07:51,363
CURRENTLY LIVING BELOW THE

268
00:07:51,363 --> 00:07:53,198
POVERTY LINE.

269
00:07:53,198 --> 00:07:55,367
IT'S ABOUT 24,000 PER HOUSEHOLD.

270
00:07:55,367 --> 00:07:58,570
AS FOR THE CONDITIONS OF THE

271
00:07:58,704 --> 00:07:59,905
CHILDREN ARE HOUSED IN, THEY

272
00:07:59,905 --> 00:08:02,374
LIVE A LOT BETTER THAN SOME

273
00:08:02,374 --> 00:08:06,345
INNER-CITY KIDS ARE SAY THE

274
00:08:06,345 --> 00:08:07,112
11,472 HOMELESS VETERANS LIVING

275
00:08:07,112 --> 00:08:11,483
HERE IN CALIFORNIA.

276
00:08:11,483 --> 00:08:12,684
>> ANYTHING WE'VE SEEN, THE

277
00:08:12,684 --> 00:08:13,385
GOVERNMENT HAS PROVIDED.

278
00:08:13,385 --> 00:08:16,488
IT DOESN'T FEEL LIKE WE ARE IN

279
00:08:16,488 --> 00:08:16,989
THE UNITED STATES.

280
00:08:16,989 --> 00:08:18,190
>> DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND

281
00:08:18,190 --> 00:08:18,957
HUMAN SERVICES INVITED US INSIDE

282
00:08:18,957 --> 00:08:19,958
BECAUSE THEY WANTED TO SHOW US

283
00:08:19,958 --> 00:08:21,059
RELATIVELY SPEAKING HUG WITH THE

284
00:08:21,059 --> 00:08:22,961
CONDITIONS ARE, I GUESS YOU

285
00:08:22,961 --> 00:08:23,362
COULD SAY.

286
00:08:23,362 --> 00:08:24,196
THERE ARE LICENSED PROFESSIONALS

287
00:08:24,196 --> 00:08:25,163
AND THEY ARE TAKING CARE OF THE

288
00:08:25,163 --> 00:08:25,631
CHILDREN.

289
00:08:25,631 --> 00:08:26,732
THEY ARE NOT CAGES.

290
00:08:26,732 --> 00:08:30,369
THEY ARE NOT FENCES.

291
00:08:30,369 --> 00:08:31,236
>> Laura: IT'S JUST

292
00:08:31,236 --> 00:08:31,637
RIDICULOUS.

293
00:08:31,637 --> 00:08:33,272
THE BOTTOM LINE IS THESE KIDS

294
00:08:33,272 --> 00:08:34,373
SHOULD BE UNITED WITH HER

295
00:08:34,373 --> 00:08:36,375
PARENTS, FOR SURE.

296
00:08:36,375 --> 00:08:37,442
REUNITED WITH HER PARENTS.

297
00:08:37,442 --> 00:08:40,345
BACK IN THEIR HOME COUNTRIES.

298
00:08:40,345 --> 00:08:42,246
THEY SHOULD NOT BE BURDENS TO

299
00:08:42,246 --> 00:08:42,948
THE UNITED STATES TAXPAYER OR

300
00:08:42,948 --> 00:08:45,450
THROWN INTO A SYSTEM OF FOSTER

301
00:08:45,450 --> 00:08:46,652
CARE BY PARENTS WHO THINK COMING

302
00:08:46,652 --> 00:08:50,489
ACROSS THE BORDER WITH CHILDREN

303
00:08:50,489 --> 00:08:51,757
WOULD ASSURE THEM EVENTUALLY

304
00:08:51,757 --> 00:08:52,991
LEGALIZED STATUS.

305
00:08:52,991 --> 00:08:53,692
THE PRESIDENT WANTS THE

306
00:08:53,692 --> 00:08:57,195
SEPARATION TO END AS WELL.

307
00:08:57,195 --> 00:09:00,399
>> PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS SAID THIS

308
00:09:00,399 --> 00:09:01,767
LAWLESSNESS CANNOT CONTINUE.

309
00:09:01,767 --> 00:09:03,802
WE DO NOT WANT TO SEPARATE

310
00:09:03,802 --> 00:09:05,170
PARENTS FROM THEIR CHILDREN.

311
00:09:05,170 --> 00:09:06,271
YOU CAN BE SURE OF THAT.

312
00:09:06,271 --> 00:09:09,808
IF WE BUILD A WALL, WE PASSED

313
00:09:09,808 --> 00:09:11,810
SOME LEGISLATION, WE CLOSE SOME

314
00:09:11,810 --> 00:09:12,744
LOOPHOLES, WE WON'T FACE THESE

315
00:09:12,744 --> 00:09:15,547
TERRIBLE CHOICES.

316
00:09:15,547 --> 00:09:17,983
>> Laura: RATHER THAN TRY TO

317
00:09:17,983 --> 00:09:19,351
SCORE POLITICAL POINTS,

318
00:09:19,351 --> 00:09:20,252
DEMOCRATS AND REPUBLICANS LIKE

319
00:09:20,252 --> 00:09:21,687
SESSIONS IS INDICATED, SHOULD

320
00:09:21,687 --> 00:09:22,487
COME TOGETHER.

321
00:09:22,487 --> 00:09:24,156
THEY SHOULD DO WHAT'S BEST FOR

322
00:09:24,156 --> 00:09:26,792
THE COUNTRY, FOR THE AMERICAN

323
00:09:26,792 --> 00:09:28,694
CITIZEN AND THE AMERICAN WORKERS

324
00:09:28,694 --> 00:09:29,961
AND THESE IMMIGRANT CHILDREN.

325
00:09:29,961 --> 00:09:32,531
THE LAW SHOULD BE CHANGED SO

326
00:09:32,531 --> 00:09:34,066
THAT THE BORDER PATROL CAN TURN

327
00:09:34,066 --> 00:09:35,734
AWAY INDIVIDUALS AND FAMILY

328
00:09:35,734 --> 00:09:37,736
UNITS AT THE BORDER IF NECESSARY

329
00:09:37,736 --> 00:09:38,570
UNITS AT THE BORDER IF NECESSAR

330
00:09:38,570 --> 00:09:38,937
NECESSARY.

331
00:09:38,937 --> 00:09:39,671
TODAY, ONLY MEXICANS WHO CROSS

332
00:09:39,671 --> 00:09:42,174
THE BORDER ILLEGALLY CAN BE

333
00:09:42,174 --> 00:09:42,974
TURNED BACK.

334
00:09:42,974 --> 00:09:44,576
THAT'S ABSURD.

335
00:09:44,576 --> 00:09:46,445
OUR BORDER PATROL DOESN'T EXIST

336
00:09:46,445 --> 00:09:48,980
AS A WAVE AND FACILITATOR FOR

337
00:09:48,980 --> 00:09:50,549
ANY GROUP OF SUPPOSED FAMILY

338
00:09:50,549 --> 00:09:52,484
MEMBERS WHO MOUTHED THE SCRIPT

339
00:09:52,484 --> 00:09:54,119
GIVEN TO THEM BY LAWYERS,

340
00:09:54,119 --> 00:09:55,454
NONGOVERNMENTAL INSTITUTIONS OR

341
00:09:55,454 --> 00:09:57,789
OTHER PEOPLE IN THEIR HOME

342
00:09:57,789 --> 00:09:59,591
COUNTRIES THAT THEY MOUTH FOR

343
00:09:59,591 --> 00:10:00,158
ASYLUM.

344
00:10:00,158 --> 00:10:01,360
THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ARE FOOTING

345
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:04,363
A REALLY BIG BILL FOR WHAT IS

346
00:10:04,363 --> 00:10:06,565
TANTAMOUNT TO A SLOW ROLLING

347
00:10:06,565 --> 00:10:08,266
INVASION OF THE UNITED STATES.

348
00:10:08,266 --> 00:10:10,969
AND WE CAN NO LONGER PERMIT

349
00:10:10,969 --> 00:10:12,003
CENTRAL AMERICAN COUNTRIES TO

350
00:10:12,003 --> 00:10:13,071
EXPORT THEIR PROPERTY AND THEIR

351
00:10:13,071 --> 00:10:16,575
DESPERATION TO OUR NATION.

352
00:10:16,575 --> 00:10:19,745
OUR OWN CHILDREN, BLACK, WHITE,

353
00:10:19,745 --> 00:10:22,381
ASIAN, LATINO NEED HELP TOO.

354
00:10:22,381 --> 00:10:25,250
IN DETROIT, HERE IN L.A., IN

355
00:10:25,250 --> 00:10:28,687
HARTFORD, MIAMI, CHICAGO.

356
00:10:28,687 --> 00:10:30,789
SO WHY DON'T THE BUSHES AND

357
00:10:30,789 --> 00:10:32,357
OBAMA'S AND THESE LEFT-WING

358
00:10:32,357 --> 00:10:33,492
REPORTERS EMOTING TODAY THE

359
00:10:33,492 --> 00:10:34,793
WHITE HOUSE AND ALL THE

360
00:10:34,793 --> 00:10:35,427
PRO-AMNESTY DEMOCRATS AND

361
00:10:35,427 --> 00:10:36,161
REPUBLICANS, WHY DON'T THEY EVER

362
00:10:36,161 --> 00:10:40,165
WRITE OFF BEDS OR CRY FOR THOSE

363
00:10:40,165 --> 00:10:41,166
KIDS?

364
00:10:41,166 --> 00:10:42,200
YOU KNOW WHY?

365
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:44,369
BECAUSE THEY THINK THIS OVER THE

366
00:10:44,369 --> 00:00:00,000
AND THE MISREPRESENTED WILL OF
