so Hillary Clinton has now joined the Jill Stein quixotic recount effort in swing states including Wisconsin Pennsylvania in Michigan campaign Council mark Elias announced that while the Clinton campaign had no evidence of hacked voting systems they wanted to ensure the veracity of the vote quote because we had not uncovered any actionable evidence of hacking or outside attempts to alter the voting technology we had not planned to exercise this option ourselves but now that a recount has been initiated in Wisconsin we intend to participate in order to ensure the process proceeds in a manner that is fair to all sides unquote Stein is infamously launching the recount effort if you missed it in an obvious effort to raise money for the Green Party so what's the goal here well not to overturn election results clearly because Hillary lost but Ron Fournier of National Journal raises another awful horrifying possibility quote raising doubts about the legitimacy of the election even without overturning the results as part of Clinton's plans to keep her options open for 2020 make some calls you'll hear the same from her confidants except this would actually be the best-case scenario for Republicans hillary was a historically bad candidate she was the first female major party candidate in history and she was somehow unable to beat the guy who was caught on tape talking about grabbing woman by the bleep her husband was a president with significant blue-collar appeal she lost the blue collar white vote in historic fashion she and even matched Barack Obama's numbers among Hispanics after Trump openly said a judge of Mexican descent couldn't judge his case fairly she relied on Hollywood glitz rather than on-the-ground campaigning and she paid for it with the White House Hillary for re-election in 2020 would be incredible for Republicans who'd be so great she'd be back she'd be twice as annoying which is almost mathematically impossible she'd have half the enthusiasm again almost mathematically impossible and she doesn't have the energy level which means that she would be twice as dead meanwhile she would suck all of the oxygen out of the room preventing other candidates from rising her corruption would ensure any future Trump corruption would be negated as a campaign issue Republicans should pray for more Hillary Clinton in a way though Hillary doesn't really have much of a choice donations to the Clinton Foundation of plummeted since her loss since there's no pay if there's no pay for play what happens to her if she merely becomes a failed presidential candidate Hillary needs access in order to sell the access so watch for a Hillary comeback we can only hope and pray that once again Hillary's ego drives her to new lows I'm Ben

always excellent Fidel Castro bit the bullet 90 years too late I shouldn't say that maybe who's a good child I don't know but but certainly about 60 years too late he took over Cuba at age 32 so any time before that it could have gone that I've been alright he did an enormous amount of damage to people the media have treated him as though he was a controversial figure as opposed to a mass murdering barbaric dictator he was basically low-rent Stalin for people who don't know much about Fidel Castro and I want to go through and talk a little bit about what Fidel Castro actually did because the left will never tell you straight exactly what was wrong with Fidel Castro because the thing about Fidel Castro for the left is the left is pretty much fine the left is pretty much ok with anything that that will that other leftist to do they they're not in love with the mass murder but if mass murder has to get done in order to create the new utopia they can live with it so the front page of the New York Times said a revolutionary who defied the US and held Cuba in his thrall well he didn't actually hold Cuba in his thrall he actually created a giant gulag and sentenced everybody in the country to stay in it and he wasn't a revolutionary so much as he was a socialist dictator who murdered all dissidents but I think that it's important to go through some of the facts about about Fidel Castro so we will do that today so first of all Fidel Castro took over the country in 1959 he took over from a guy named general Batista general Batista was also a dictator but he was sort of a right-wing dictator and general Batista under Batista Cuba was one of the richest countries in Latin America it was on the upswing and sort of like not a good guy Bautista but sort of like Pinochet except less violent he was eventually gonna end up transitioning into a form of democracy in all likelihood instead there's a violent revolution with Castro and its source and here is Fidel Castro taking power here's what it looked like outside Havana's presidential palace hundreds of thousands rally at the call of revolutionary leader Fidel Castro who estimated their number at a million most of the throng wears the colors of Castro's 26th of July Movement they are in an exultant mood man who overthrew the Batista dictatorship calls on them to approve the public trials and executions of pro Batista figures guilty of war crimes and atrocities the executions some 250 to date have been widely criticized by many as too hasty and summary even if justified says Castro the Cuban revolutionary government no reason to offer explanations to America or to anyone except the people of Cuba Gastner asks his audience if it favors the summary court-martial and gets his answer in a roar of approval executing thousands and thousands of people he conspired with the mass murderer Che Guevara will talk about che in just a minute to overthrow Fugazi a Batista who was that dictator and then he began a guerrilla campaign resulting in his takeover of the island he immediately exiled priests he exiled all all religious figures he destroyed religious schools he nationalized all businesses he imprisoned and murders murdered his enemies within the first three months he had between 600 and 1100 people shot che guevara said is a direct quote from Shea this this piece of crap who you see people walking around with his face on t-shirts it's like walking around again with a solid t-shirt said to send men to the firing squad judicial proof is unnecessary is what Che Guevara said these procedures are in a que ik boos wha detail this is a revolution and a revolutionary must become a cold killing machine motivated by pure hate we must create a pedagogy of the paradigm that's the execution law so you have to teach people through the execution while Castro actually imprisoned more of his citizens by percentage than Hitler or Stalin by 1961 hit imprison to three hundred thousand human beings he asked the Soviet Union's actually nuke the United States in 1961 during the Cuban Missile Crisis Castro supported terrorist groups all over the world ranging from FARC and Colombia to Shining Path in Peru and the Sandinistas in Nicaragua hundreds of thousands of Cubans fled millions actually many drowned in the ocean thousands people drowned in the ocean as they attempted to sail to Florida between 1959 and 1992 at least two million Cubans fled Cuba now some of the lies that you'll be told is that he didn't impoverish q but he absolutely did the average GDP per capita in in Cuba when Castro took over was a little bit over $2,000 per person per year by 1999 the average GDP per capita remember there's a forty year period by 1999 the per capita GDP in the nation was $2,300 so it advanced $300 in 40 years according to discover the networks the average daily wage for agricultural workers in Cuba in 1958 was 3 bucks the average daily wage in France at the time was 2 dollars and 73 cents Cuba had in 1958 the year before Castro took over the highest standard of living of any latin-american country and half of Europe here's the Wall Street Journal the Cuba that Castro inherited was developing but relatively prosperous and ranked third in Latin America in doctors and dentists and daily calorie consumption per capita its infant mortality rate was the lowest in the region and the 13th lowest in the world Cubans were among the most literate Latins and had a vibrant civic life with private professional commercial religious and charitable organizations Castro destroyed all of it he ruined agriculture by imposing collective farms making Cuba dependent first on the Soviets and later on oil from Hugo Chavez's Venezuela in the past half-century Cuba's export growth has been less than Hades and now even doctors are scarce because so many are sent abroad to earn foreign currency hospitals don't even have sheets or aspirin the average monthly income is twenty dollars government food rations are inadequate as for that healthcare you always hear about the Cuban healthcare absolute crap there are three systems there the socialist revolutionaries you guy could care there the foreigners who come and pay with cash like Fat Michael Moore and then there is and then there is the actual people of Cuba this is according to Jane or blender of national reviews at hospitals and clinics our crumbling conditions are so unsanitary patients may be better off at home whatever home is if they do have to go to the hospital they must bring their own bed sheets soap towels food lightbulbs even toilet paper that's how poor healthcare is imagine you go to the hospital and you have to bring your own light bulbs and toilet paper basic medications are scarce doctors have been known to reuse latex gloves okay the whole point of latex gloves that you don't reuse them as for the infant mortality right they're constantly bragging about the infant mortality right that's because they do all sorts of prenatal checkup so they want to keep that statistic artificially high and the way that they do that is they do prenatal checkups if there's any danger to the pregnancy at all they simply abort the kid so the abortion rates in Cuba are extraordinarily extraordinarily high it really is a horrifying system of government and that's been brought about by the Castros but look how the media just worshipped the Castro so this is Ed Sullivan Ed Sullivan head-on Castro this is 1961 I believe or 1959 and here's ed Sullivan who's then the most popular television host in the United States praising Fidel Castro were you a baseball pitcher yes they were feature basketball basketball act we keep every every everything evidence part well undoubtedly all about exercise you didn't school prepare you for this role they helped me very much amount before the fine young man in a very smart young man with the help of God and our prayers and to help the American government he will come up with the sort of democracy down there that America could have he he'll create the sort of democracy America should have unbelievable this have a media tree to Fidel Castro a mass murdering dictator mass murdering dictator Castro on Face the Nation here's Castro appearing on face the nation's from 1959 Cuba is now very strong and with a tremendous force no body is enough powerful now the public opinion okay so he says the public opinion was right this is always what socialist revolutionaries would-be dictators say whenever somebody talks about public opinion making might right that's never a good thing it's why demagogues are scary right people who come up and they say well the public says I can do this doesn't matter what the law says doesn't matter what the Constitution says the people want it we'll have summary executions again tens of thousands of people murdered hundreds of thousands of people imprisoned by Fidel Castro talking about human rights three years later he was dead and he dead because he went into other parts of Latin America and attempted to lead coos their communist coos there's he's talking there about how nobody should interfere with Cuba and then he promptly went to Latin America and attempted to start a revolution in Bolivia and was killed for his trouble thank God he was really terrible human being che Guevara for you want to see what it was like for Cubans living in Castro's Cuba people still are by the way thanks to the incompetence of Barack Obama and this idiotic policy imposed over the last 50 years in the United States I've never been in favor of this policy that the United States has with regard to with regard to non assassination it makes no sense to me I don't see why literally millions upon millions generations of people should live in terror and suffering because we have to let an old piece of crap like an old disgusting desiccated piece of human debris like Fidel Castro live we wouldn't better off killing him but but here's here's what it was like in Cuba and still is like in Cuba people can't escape it's a giant prison here's some footage of Cuban refugees here's what people were doing just to get out of Castro's Cuba while all of these Westerners were praising Cuba as this Halcyon of light and liberty here is here's what it actually looked like for people try and get out in 2003 news media the world over broadcast this image a dozen Cubans sailing for freedom aboard an old green Chevy truck Luis and his three-year-old son on Hill were on board Luis explained to me that few new cars entered Cuba after the Revolution in the 1950s but his old one worked just fine he tells me he was scared building the boat in secret and pushing from shore in the dark of night but he was willing to risk everything for a better life in America okay I mean this is again hundreds of thousands of people attempting to escape Cuba in the early 1980s there are so many people trying to escape the Fidel Castro actually said fine and then he sent a huge number of kind of the the Cuban criminal class he let them escape he let all the criminals go to Miami and that's why he saw a major upsurge in crime and the drug trade in Miami in the early part of the 1980s but people have been attempting to float in cars I mean this how you ended up with with the situation with the was that Gonzalez what was the name of the the kid who was deported back to Cuba after his after his dad died on the way over from or his mother died on the way over from Cuba and then he was deported back to Cuba thanks to the Clinton administration people have been attempting to get out of Cuba for 450 years thanks to the Castro's I here's some footage of Castro's prisoners speaking about what it was like to be a dissident in Castro's Cuba it was like being in the depths of hell the suffering made me a little crazy but my husband and children wrote to me in that kept me going she said Cardona husband Hank Hill were arrested at a small anti-government demonstration in May 2014 their crime they say chanting down with Fidel Castro we're always saying yeah it's like I see you about a boy request more education for Cubans has been about fear and how to be afraid about how to avoid confrontation with the authorities because they have power they teach you what they want you to know but not really what goes on in the world he said that girl Dale and both were released on January 8th according to their prison papers the pair spent eight months behind bars of what they say were appalling conditions okay and that's not unusual lots of people died and just went missing in in Castro's prisons Castro had a special hatred for homosexuals so very early in his regime he basically rounded up homosexuals here is testimony from some gay folks who are rounded up by Fidel Castro and put in prison camps when Dominic Mooney that's a la la una lista de los can be asserted without program to know even otras when I were saying gawe Paulo's friend Catherine % e al exceeded every imaginable in stones nahi Nablus a la persona person being purged a year algo okay now here we are hanging there are people aware and Porter but people were shot and killed themselves as we see that important think that in continuation if the public are they were ashamed before the release to allow me you see unfamiliar class he had to go home and say some killed themselves okay that was not uncommon in Castro's Cuba and again this is somebody who mass executions were not were not uncommon in Castro's Cuba here is a here's a footage of one of the original executions this was released by the Castro regime very early on this was a supposedly a member of Batista's regime so it's a lightful folks delightful folks the reason that I do all of this is because the left in America and in the West glorified people like Castro they really do and it's truly disgusting so first we're gonna give you and we're gonna have to first let me take a break real fast and so let's say hello to our friends over at trunk club so on the lighter side obviously it's now Black Friday for Black Friday it's

are top-notch its trunk club.com slash been trunk club comm slash been so back to our story the reactions to the cast for death are really quite telling the difference between right and left on the Castro death is really quite amazing so Donald Trump gave what I thought is the best thing that he's done this entire campaign it's the best thing that I've done that I think that Donald Trump has done since he's since he announced here was Donald Trump's statement on the on the death of Fidel Castro and he didn't write this but doesn't matter he's the president-elect so he put it out it says quote today the world marks the passing of a brutal dictator who oppressed his own people for nearly six decades Fidel Castro's legacy is one of firing squads theft unimaginable suffering poverty and the denial of fundamental human rights while Cuba remains a totalitarian island it is my hope that today marks a move away from the horrors endured for so long and toward a future in which the wonderful Cuban people finally live in the freedom they so richly deserve though the tragedies deaths and pains caused by Fidel Castro cannot be erased our administration will do all it can to ensure the Cuban people can finally begin their journey to our prosperity and liberty I joined the many Cuban Americans who supported me so greatly in the presidential campaign including the brigade 2506 Veterans Association that endorsed me with the hope of one day soon seeing a free Cuba this is the best statement that there was from any world leader on this that's exactly right Fidel Castro does not deserve one iota of praise Reince Priebus came out and he said look you know Obama's famous deal that he did with it with the Castro's we'll just renege on it we're not going to do that anymore because that deal is a total train wreck and everybody knows it and anything that we can do to get rid of it we will know there's parts of it that may be very difficult to to get out of but we're going to look to a fresh look at it but fresh eyes on that deal and I can assure you if anyone can renegotiate that deal or do something about it make it better for the American people and that start a nuclear arms race in the Middle East it's going to be president-elect Trump okay so if he if he rips up the Cuba deal that would be a wonderful thing obviously Ted Cruz says the Obama administration has strengthened the Cuban regime clearly they have unfortunately the policies of the Obama administration have made that less likely what the Obama administration has done is strengthened Raul Castro Raul is the dictator now you know I asked my dad at dinner last night well what do you think happens now that Fidel is dead and and he shrugged and said Raul's been in charge for years that this is the system has gotten stronger and what Obama has done is funneled billions of dollars to Raul Castro which is being used to oppress dissidents you know in 2015 roughly 10,000 political arrests occurred in Cuba that is five times as many as occurred in 2010 when they were only about 2000 this tyrannical regime has gotten stronger because of a weak president weak foreign policy and it is very much my hope and belief that with a new president coming into office in January President Trump a new administration that that u.s. foreign policy not just to Cuba but towards our enemies whether they are Iran or North Korea will no longer be a policy of weakness and appeasement but instead using us strength to force and and press for change okay so that's the okay so here is the so that is the the left that's the right stake on on the Castro death for more for the left's take and this is where it really gets interesting you you're gonna have to go to Daley wire calm and subscribe we have to cut
