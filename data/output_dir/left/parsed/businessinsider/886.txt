the Supreme Court matters a great great
deal it matters for workers who want to
protect both their lives and their jobs
for employees who need to be able to
seek redress for discrimination for
parents who want their kids to get a
fair shake in the education system it is
with all this in mind that I I have come
to a decision about the current nominee
after careful deliberation I have
concluded that I cannot support judge
Neil Gorsuch his nomination to the
Supreme Court his nomination will have a
cloture vote he will have to earn 60
votes for confirmation my vote will be
no and I urge my colleagues to do the
same
