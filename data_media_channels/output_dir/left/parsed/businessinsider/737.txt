you gotta paint up evening because
you're a judge that you get some
advantage I've had to pay all my
ticket
first of all if you amass a significant
amount of parking tickets the key thing
is that interest and fines and can be
attached to those parts so if you get a
$100 parking ticket and you ignore it it
could go to $1,000 after a while and if
you get so much so the the city can get
a judgment against you they can they can
seize your vehicle they can screw up
your credit let's say you get 10 parking
tickets in New York and you move to
California and you don't pay the parking
tickets in New York the moment you
violate them you become liable for
whatever penalties or finds the the
municipality decided was reasonable for
that infraction it doesn't evaporate
just because you move out of town you
always have a better shot at going in
and saying yeah and and being humble
about it so yeah I'd like to resolve
this but here's my problem
most clerks working we're going to say
if people do they get tickets to this
how much time you need I'll give you to
come back but don't ignore me don't make
a fool of me if I had one theme its
honesty is the best policy
always always or don't say anything
you
