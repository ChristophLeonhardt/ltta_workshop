Barcelona where police have shot dead a man who tried to attack officers with a knife at a police station the incident is being treated as terrorism it happened outside within the compound of a police station in the west of the city earlier on Monday no other injuries have been reported the man was a 29 year old of Algerian origin who shouted God is greatest in Arabic as he launched his attack on Friday Spain marked one year since a terrorist drove a van into pedestrians in a crowded Barcelona Street killing 13 I saw many people running I saw the covered bodies of kids lying in the street this is a tragedy we saw an avalanche of people running in every direction it was total chaos we had no idea what was going on I didn't see the van I just heard a boom boom boom sound and people screaming well let's get more insight now from chris phillips chris is the former head of Britain's National Counterterrorism Security office and is always welcome on the program hi Chris Chris just out the description of the instant what is it about the knife attack that leads police to considered a terror attack as opposed to an assault against officers well I think quite simply the god is greatest' who's going to give them a big clue in that and of course it is almost exactly 12 months ago since we saw the attacks in Barcelona so they would have been on a bit of an alert time it's often often when you have periods like this where you had incidents anniversaries are quite important so I can I can quite understand why they would consider this a terrorist attack and it just goes to show just the sheer issue that the police forces around the around the continent of God dealing with individuals like this perhaps and of course on top of that they got the issue with with groups of people that may be still at large yeah that summer last year just was horrific wasn't it do you think that the attack was timed to coincide with the first anniversary of that in which 13 pedestrians died on a lot more could have yeah well that's often the case that anniversaries are very important to terrorists it it seems to spur them on to do other things as well there and and I think what we're seeing here is copycatting this is a clear copycat from other attacks that have taken place probably it'll turn out that this guy has got no training he's just a bit of an extremist maybe a bit of violent past and decides to go out in in a way that's going to kill the poor innocent police officer luckily they were able to deal with him very quickly I think we've got to remember though that this is this is really we've got away with another terrorist attack here last year 12 months ago that Barcelona attack was supposed to be three big vehicle bombs which would have been absolutely devastating and would have killed potentially hundreds of people rather than what we ended up with which was an individual driving a car down through las ramblas yes well Chris when you're talking about Barcelona it's one of the biggest tourist hotspots on the planet especially during summer there was already a lot of police on the streets how much more on alert our security services during I suppose sombre anniversaries of of terror atrocities a time when feelings are heightened yeah that's always a case that where there's anniversaries often it's june ramadan that attacks take place and that you know you get bigger groupings of attacks more killing if you like so i think these things are taken into account but of course when you're the police officer that suddenly gets confronted by an individual with a knife for no particular reason who comes at you it's a really difficult thing to deal with but i say again this is another lucky escape that we've had from a terrorist attack similar to what we had in london last week you know whether that's terrorism or not it was a bit lucky that the guy didn't do a very good job of what he was trying to attempt to do how do you view the situation in europe as a whole there's a lot more security and put in place it seems is there more to do is there anything that can be done when somebody has it in their mind that they're going to stage a terror attack like this well there's not much you can do with an individual like this who just out of the blue decides excuse me the blue decides to commit a fairly low-level terrorist attack there's there's nothing you can do other than deal with the threat as it happens what you can deal with is the is the groups the the more scary people really who are linked up in groups of people with guns and bombs making bombs and and with with an idea to kill hundreds of people as we saw in paris with a better plan are you hopeful that enough is being done on that particularly just briefly well yes the security services of course you're getting better thank goodness okay chris phillips thanks for coming the program once again always good to get your take former head of Britain's national counterterrorism security office you
