I want to go through John Bolton's record a little bit and and in a minute I'm gonna go through his record and rather fulsome and fashion we'll discuss what his actual views are and how they will impact the administration whether we should be worried about him the national security adviser HR McMaster is out this had been rumored for legitimately half a year one of the things that was really funny is that last week Trump tweeted out that HR McMaster was completely securing his job he also tweeted out that one of his lawyers again him John Dowd was completely securing his job and then that guy left the media had reported both of them were on the outs Trump of course has fake news it turns out that was not fake news because when Trump says fake news it's only fake news like forty percent of the time well the guy who was replacing HR McMaster McMaster was sort of a foreign policy policy establishment guy and somebody who believed in sort of realpolitik balance of power he tended to be relatively a kind of weirdly interventionist in certain areas and non-interventionist another he was he had kind of a squishy view of the Iran deal John Bolton's views are extraordinarily clear John Bolton is the person who had wanted for Secretary of State I think he'd be better in that role than his NSA but I'm happy to have him inside the administration Bolton of course was ambassador to the UN under george w bush he is not a neocon and people have said that he's in neocon he is not to define neocon there were two definitions of neocon definition number one is the historical definition which is somebody who is a lefty during the 1960s and then realized the errors of their ways they were in the in the popular phrase mugged by reality and became more conservative it was a specific movement of very heavily Jewish people in the 1960s like urban crystal and and Daniel Bell who's not Jewish but was a member of these these were the neo cons in the 1970s the people had shifted over to the other side Bolton was always a conservative so from by that definition he's not a neocon the other definition that's used is about people like Paul Wolfowitz who are very into nation-building the idea that we're supposed to go into a rock knock over Saddam and then stay there and build up the nation that was actually not something that Bolton suggested doing he said we had to get rid of Saddam because Saddam was funding terrorism and pursuing weapons of mass destruction according to every Intelligence Agency on earth but that doesn't mean that we shouldn't have turned the country back over to the Iraqis as soon as humanly possible instead of sticking around and pouring hundreds of thousands of more troops in there so he's been called a nation-building neocon for a while and that's not true he was in favor of the Arab Spring for example he is not averse to leaving American allies who happen to be dictators in power he was in favor of leaving Hosni Mubarak and power in Egypt so he is not a democracy first neocon in that sense so people are mischaracterizing in the situation democrats of course are going nuts over this chris matthews another they say the jump button got you just leave that mustache oh yeah jump boat and I get over here rump up my hair suits on wrinkled he's rolling here I do show jump boom that guy even has a mustache though yeah I said my wife Kathleen you even like mustache she said no how much let me see how about go mr. Hawkes because he promised the working men and women of those states that voted for him the gritty factory workers and other people who didn't like these worst cuz their kids do all the fighting and getting killed and losing their legs and everything else he said to them no more stupid Wars now he brings in the godfather of stupid Wars John Bolton anyway the congressman has been with us thank you so much Eric so of California he's got by these stupid wise John but who's John button small jumbles like Under Secretary of State for Near East affairs or something like at the time so you know again the idea that John Bolton was the architect of the Iraq war is just not true
