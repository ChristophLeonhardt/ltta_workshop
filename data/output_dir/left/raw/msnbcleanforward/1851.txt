AGGRIEVY. LET’S WALK THROUGH THIS.

55
00:01:47,074 --> 00:01:51,201
LET’S WALK THROUGH THIS. U.S. PRICES FOR STEAL ANDEL AND

56
00:01:51,212 --> 00:01:52,403
U.S. PRICES FOR STEAL ANDEL AND ALUMINUM ARE UP SINCE THE START

58
00:01:54,048 --> 00:01:57,876
OF THE YEAR. 33% FOR STEEL AND 11% FOR

59
00:01:57,918 --> 00:01:58,275
33% FOR STEEL AND 11% FOR ALUMINUM.

60
00:01:58,286 --> 00:01:59,810
ALUMINUM. IF YOU ARE A STEEL OR ALUMINUM

61
00:01:59,854 --> 00:02:01,145
IF YOU ARE A STEEL OR ALUMINUM PRODUCER LIKE U.S. STEEL, THAT’S

62
00:02:01,188 --> 00:02:01,512
PRODUCER LIKE U.S. STEEL, THAT’S AMAZING.

63
00:02:01,522 --> 00:02:03,114
AMAZING. BUT THERE ARE A LOT LESS JOBS IN

64
00:02:03,157 --> 00:02:05,316
BUT THERE ARE A LOT LESS JOBS IN THE ALUMINUM AND STEEL

65
00:02:05,326 --> 00:02:06,717
THE ALUMINUM AND STEEL PRODUCTION INDUSTRY THAN THOSE

66
00:02:06,727 --> 00:02:09,353
PRODUCTION INDUSTRY THAN THOSE WHO USE ALUMINUM AND STEAL.

67
00:02:09,396 --> 00:02:12,123
WHO USE ALUMINUM AND STEAL. SO IS THAT GOING TO AFFECT HOW

68
00:02:12,166 --> 00:02:13,024
SO IS THAT GOING TO AFFECT HOW MUCH WE PAY FOR BEER AND SODA

69
00:02:13,034 --> 00:02:14,625
MUCH WE PAY FOR BEER AND SODA AND THE JOBS IN THOSE

70
00:02:14,636 --> 00:02:15,025
AND THE JOBS IN THOSE INDUSTRIES?

71
00:02:15,036 --> 00:02:19,063
INDUSTRIES? >> WELL, IT VERY MUCH COULD,

72
00:02:19,107 --> 00:02:19,430
>> WELL, IT VERY MUCH COULD, STEPHANIE.

73
00:02:19,474 --> 00:02:20,164
STEPHANIE. U.S. BEER SUPPORTS 2.2 MILLION

74
00:02:20,208 --> 00:02:20,832
U.S. BEER SUPPORTS 2.2 MILLION AMERICAN JOBS.

75
00:02:20,875 --> 00:02:22,633
AMERICAN JOBS. AND THESE TAR RICHES ON ALUMINUM

76
00:02:22,644 --> 00:02:25,936
AND THESE TAR RICHES ON ALUMINUM AND ON STEAL, WE ESTIMATE AMOUNT

77
00:02:25,947 --> 00:02:28,606
AND ON STEAL, WE ESTIMATE AMOUNT TO A $350 MILLION TAX ON BEER

78
00:02:28,649 --> 00:02:29,440
TO A $350 MILLION TAX ON BEER BREWERS IN THE UNITED STATES.

79
00:02:29,450 --> 00:02:31,409
BREWERS IN THE UNITED STATES. FROM THE LARGEST BREWERS TO THE

FROM THE LARGEST BREWERS TO THE SMALLEST BREWERS.

81
00:02:32,453 --> 00:02:33,711
SMALLEST BREWERS. AND THOSE BREWERS ARE GOING TO

82
00:02:33,721 --> 00:02:35,647
AND THOSE BREWERS ARE GOING TO HAVE TO FIGURE OUT A WAY TO

83
00:02:35,690 --> 00:02:37,516
HAVE TO FIGURE OUT A WAY TO INCORPORATE THOSE ADDED COSTS IN

84
00:02:37,558 --> 00:02:38,549
INCORPORATE THOSE ADDED COSTS IN THEIR PRODUCTION.

85
00:02:38,592 --> 00:02:41,018
THEIR PRODUCTION. ALUMINUM IS THE SINGLE BIGGEST

86
00:02:41,062 --> 00:02:42,921
ALUMINUM IS THE SINGLE BIGGEST INPUT COSTS FOR AMERICAN BREWERS

87
00:02:42,931 --> 00:02:44,556
INPUT COSTS FOR AMERICAN BREWERS AND THESE TAXES ARE HAVING A

88
00:02:44,566 --> 00:02:46,357
AND THESE TAXES ARE HAVING A GREAT AFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS.

89
00:02:46,401 --> 00:02:47,291
GREAT AFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS. >> HOW MUCH MORE CAN CONSUMERS

90
00:02:47,335 --> 00:02:48,459

91
00:02:48,503 --> 00:02:49,760
BE EXPECTED TO PAY? >> WE’RE LUCKY ENOUGH IN THE

00:02:49,771 --> 00:02:51,730
>> WE’RE LUCKY ENOUGH IN THE UNITED STATES TO HAVE NEARLY

93
00:02:51,773 --> 00:02:53,865
UNITED STATES TO HAVE NEARLY 6,000 BREWERYIES IN THIS COUNTRY

94
00:02:53,908 --> 00:02:55,200
6,000 BREWERYIES IN THIS COUNTRY FROM THE LARGEST TO THE

95
00:02:55,243 --> 00:02:55,567
FROM THE LARGEST TO THE SMALLEST.

96
00:02:55,610 --> 00:02:57,168
SMALLEST. THOSE ARE 6,000 INDIVIDUAL

97
00:02:57,179 --> 00:02:57,568
THOSE ARE 6,000 INDIVIDUAL BUSINESSES.

98
00:02:57,579 --> 00:02:58,570
BUSINESSES. THEY’RE REALLY GOING TO HAVE TO

99
00:02:58,580 --> 00:02:59,938
THEY’RE REALLY GOING TO HAVE TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO DEAL WITH

100
00:02:59,981 --> 00:03:01,973
FIGURE OUT HOW TO DEAL WITH THESE COSTS.

101
00:03:01,983 --> 00:03:04,776
THESE COSTS. THE LAYOFF WORKERS, WE ESTIMATE

102
00:03:04,819 --> 00:03:06,811
THE LAYOFF WORKERS, WE ESTIMATE THESE TARIFFS COULD LEAD TO

103
00:03:06,855 --> 00:03:08,880
THESE TARIFFS COULD LEAD TO 20,000 LOST JOBS SUPPORTED BY

104
00:03:08,890 --> 00:03:11,983
20,000 LOST JOBS SUPPORTED BY AMERICAN BREWING.

105
00:03:12,026 --> 00:03:13,051
AMERICAN BREWING. RAISE PRICES.

106
00:03:13,094 --> 00:03:14,953
RAISE PRICES. CUT THEIR OFFERINGS.

107
00:03:14,963 --> 00:03:16,554
CUT THEIR OFFERINGS. SO EVERYONE IN BEER IS GOING TO

SO EVERYONE IN BEER IS GOING TO HAVE TO DEAL WITH THIS IN THEIR

109

>> WE BELIEVE THERE ARE. THAT’S WHY THIS POLICY IN OUR

166
00:04:57,100 --> 00:04:58,857
THAT’S WHY THIS POLICY IN OUR VIEW IS WRONG HEADED.

167
00:04:58,901 --> 00:05:00,159
VIEW IS WRONG HEADED. TARIFFS ARE TAXES.

168
00:05:00,169 --> 00:05:02,061
TARIFFS ARE TAXES. AND SOMEONE HAS TO PAY THOSE

169
00:05:02,071 --> 00:05:03,796
AND SOMEONE HAS TO PAY THOSE TAXES.

170
00:05:03,839 --> 00:05:04,497
TAXES. WHETHER IT BE THE CONSUMER OR

171
00:05:04,507 --> 00:05:06,632
WHETHER IT BE THE CONSUMER OR THE PRODUCER OF BEER AND OTHER

172
00:05:06,676 --> 00:05:08,768
THE PRODUCER OF BEER AND OTHER PRODUCTS THAT AMERICANS USE.

173
00:05:08,778 --> 00:05:10,903
PRODUCTS THAT AMERICANS USE. BEER IS A SHINING JEWEL IN

174
00:05:10,913 --> 00:05:12,605
BEER IS A SHINING JEWEL IN AMERICAN MANUFACTURING RIGHT

175
00:05:12,648 --> 00:05:12,872
AMERICAN MANUFACTURING RIGHT NOW.

176
00:05:12,915 --> 00:05:15,875
NOW. AS I SAY, 2.2 MILLION AMERICANS

177
00:05:15,885 --> 00:05:18,110
AS I SAY, 2.2 MILLION AMERICANS OWE THEIR LIVELIHOODS IN ONE WAY

178
00:05:18,154 --> 00:05:21,413
OWE THEIR LIVELIHOODS IN ONE WAY OR ANOTHER TO THE PRODUCTION AND

179
00:05:21,424 --> 00:05:22,515
OR ANOTHER TO THE PRODUCTION AND DISTRIBUTION OF BEER.

180
00:05:22,525 --> 00:05:24,650
DISTRIBUTION OF BEER. WE’RE CONCERNED THESE TARIFFS

181
00:05:24,694 --> 00:05:25,885
WE’RE CONCERNED THESE TARIFFS WILL HAVE A NEGATIVE IMPACT

182
00:05:25,895 --> 00:05:27,220
WILL HAVE A NEGATIVE IMPACT WHILE BRINGING BACK FEWER JOBS

183
00:05:27,230 --> 00:05:28,388
WHILE BRINGING BACK FEWER JOBS IN OTHER SECTORS.

184
00:05:28,398 --> 00:05:30,123
IN OTHER SECTORS. >> I WANT TO LOOK THAT UP.

185
00:05:30,166 --> 00:05:31,024
>> I WANT TO LOOK THAT UP. TARIFFS ARE TAXES.

186
00:05:31,034 --> 00:05:32,092
TARIFFS ARE TAXES. SOMEONE ELSE SAID THAT.

187
00:05:32,135 --> 00:00:00,000
SOMEONE ELSE SAID THAT. I REMEMBER WHO IT WAS.
