Alexandria Ocasio Cortez keeps opening her mouth and stupid statement just keep falling out that's life as a socialist coming up today on the Hollywood conservative four at the rebel I know I know I know this is starting to feel like a roast series and with all the dumb things she's saying I seriously could make a series out of this called what stupid thing Alexandria Ocasio Cortes said today so that same interview I spoke about yesterday where she tried to state that her opinion about the Israeli Palestine conflict was shaped by her humanitarian perspective of the fact that Israel has occupied Palestine so we talked yesterday about that and had a little impromptu history lesson and today it looks like we're gonna have to have a lesson on economics although considering Ocasio cortezes degree I think is in economics she clearly didn't learn anything so maybe we should just start over with her and go old school with all a good ol about me I mean it can't make her in dumber that's for sure so case in point her answer regarding current employment numbers in the US on firing line for PBS she was asked about unemployment as a you all surely know unemployment has plummeted especially in minority demographics so Ocasio Cortez is asked about that and with her degree in economics you can't believe what her explanations is she says this I think the unemployment numbers that you just talked about is part of the problem because we look at these figures and we say that unemployment is low and everything is fine right well unemployment is low because everyone has two jobs unemployment is low because people are working 60 70 80 hours a week and can barely feed their kids oh my freaking gosh your degrees in economics look as a business major I passed macro and micro by the hair of my chinny-chin-chin but even I know that that's not how you calculate unemployment that literally has nothing to do with unemployment in fact if you think about it logically if you take each person that is Cal is having a job and you give them another job a second job that would actually increase the unemployment rate because that person who was already counted as having a job who is now has a second job is taking that second job away from someone who's counted is not having a job at all so do you see so yeah Twitter had a heyday with this comment deservedly so if this chick gets voted into office in November her moron electorate deserves every crappy destructive piece of legislation that she puts forth so here's a tip for any of you who plan on running for office don't sleep through macro and microeconomics or hell even life I feel like you have to sleep through life to not know this anyway thanks for watching everybody I'm Amanda head the Hollywood conservative for the rebel if you enjoyed my commentary and want to hear more from all of us here at the rebels subscribe to our premium content at www.affordablecomm.com
