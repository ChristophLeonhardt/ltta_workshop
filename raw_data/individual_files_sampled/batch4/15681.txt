she has now this is cartwright deleted her twitter account Joe but not before we were able to save it and it's very revealing here's here's one of her tweets from 2015 Prime Minister Stephen Harper never bugged me as much as bugged most of you until Ford Fest last night so glad I never voted for him so it's a knock against Stephen Harper and a knock against Ford then she tweets out her support for Caroline Mulroney and the PC leadership campaign so in other words the one of the candidates that wanted Doug Ford's job and then there's various left leads here like she retweeted a tweet from Hillary Clinton trying to paint Trump as a racist but she has tweets that go directly after Rob Ford who you pointed that out yeah yeah and so she called him you know a ball of goo and different things like that but you mentioned Carolyn Mulrooney because that's what the game has for some people and I'm not saying for her but for some people is that they want our to fail in this election they want a minority government situation and then they want carolyn mulrooney to emerge as the leader and that's what all this sort of Fifth Column stuff is and I'm glad to report it and ice not just me saying that I did my own research on it yeah I talked to some people including right inside of Doug Ford's camp and he's now aware of it so watch out guys because he's on dia and you saw a little bit of that I know it's too late for you men Zoid because that's how it is with you yeah I'm gonna give them a little more time Doug is a good man and we'll give him a chance to kind of catch up to this don't forget it's a daunting task to take over a mess of a party and then go on this sort of your you're the face of it you've got to run it and you've got people that are kind of playing a double agent game behind your back it's not easy for you know Joe I I'm on the same wavelength as you and I know a lot of detractors will say oh oh here we go into conspiracy ville but I'm sorry we saw how fast this party turned on Patrick brown and and well they're liberals it's the only way they can beat them I mean I don't blame the names I mentioned before I mean I believe that Corey and people like that are in on it but they have to be smarter because the liberal people that will do this they have to do it and don't forget that what's happened here if you look at that after the first debate what happened was that all the support that would normally go to Kathleen Wynne went where it went over to the NDP and Andrea Horwath well and your whore what did nothing in that debate but try to get into the debate yeah and yet everybody says that so what the plan is and you can roll this back later the plan is is within seven to ten days they're gonna drop another bombshell on dog it could be similar but it around the sweet spot when they do it and then they're hoping that that would be the knockout punch and that support you know we'll be test driven on Andrea who has no real platform it's not realistic like what free you know manicures and pedicures and free massages and it goes on and on and on I don't know what the hell she's talking about and then I'll go back over to Kathleen Wynne who the media party will you know pump up and so Doug's got to really watch that if he wants to win this thing the last week was a disaster in terms of the flip flop so when we were teasing in the newsroom calling him Fosbury you know for the Fosbury flop now I don't blame him for it yeah I mean I he's ultimately responsible yeah but he's on to it now but it'd mean a lot of stuff was happening and luckily he's but a scot ocke that's an excerpt from my daily TV show the Ezra Levant show normally it's behind a paywall but I thought you'd like this video so we put it on YouTube if you want to subscribe to watch the daily show every day including always two interviews today and I read my hate mail just click on this screen and become a Premium Member you
