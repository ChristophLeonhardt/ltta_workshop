the 36 year old groping allegations against Brett Kavanaugh fall apart the economy soars to new heights and Democrat Senator mazie Hirono needs a fainting couch then the one and only Ken Starr joins the program to discuss the special counsel his old employee Brett Kavanaugh and just how wicked the Clintons really are even worse than you think finally the mail bag I'm Michael Knowles and this is the Michael Noel's show all right we've got to have the daily Kavanagh allegation update I guess that's all we do now that's all any show can do is talk about not credible allegations from 40 years ago about what a teenage Brett Kavanaugh did so this is all falling apart as I predicted by the way I would like a little credit here let the record show I never took these allegations seriously and they're even less serious today than they were yesterday or the day before so we've had a couple people come out and say I know I went to high school with them and I know that these are real and then the second anyone asks them a question they say I would never mind I take it back I take it back so that's not gonna work the the woman Christine blase Ford said that she was going to testify before Congress and then she didn't do that and then now they say they want an FBI investigation why I don't know I couldn't tell you what the FBI is going to do well there the FBI is just gonna go to the Oracle at Delphi and they're going to say so Oracle tell us what happened at a party that may or may not have even occurred 36 years ago they're gonna rub the crystal ball it's all thank goodness the federal government possesses this crystal ball to let us know what happened so that's obviously frivolous and absurd the Democrats first said that we need to hear this woman we need to hear this woman the Republicans don't want us to hear this woman and we're gonna hear her or else and then the woman said I'm not going to testify she said how dare those Republicans try to bring this woman to a hearing how dare they how insensitive she should never speak before a hearing so it's all all frivolous but I would like to give out for the first time ever on this show you know we're almost near awards season now we had the Emmys over the weekend and a month or two we'll get into the film Awards I want to give out the not a very serious person award the first annual not a very serious person award for her performance in the fake Brett Kavanaugh allegations that would go to Hawaii Democrat Senator mazie Hirono Maisie come accept your award guess who's perpetuating all of these kinds of actions it's some man in this country and I just want to say to the men in this country just shut up and step up do the right thing for a change you see I'm a little upset by this you know mazie Hirono setting women back hundreds of years where would you like a fainting couch man would you but the man I hate the man and it's all the men's fault it's okay it's okay you're there there there there it's okay step up and do it change for once she says by the way so first of all now all men are assailants or rapists or whatever according to this frivolous woman but then then she says men should step up and and do something good for once for once as though men have never done anything before I would like to point out not not to I I don't really believe in this sort of sexual conflict that mazie Hirono is bringing up but just to answer her point we know that men have stepped up and done great things before we know this even in recent history the evidence for that is that if American men had not stepped up and acted courageously and done the right thing then mazie Hirono and all of the other American women would be speaking German right now if they were even allowed to speak you know every every great war you know all of the defense of our country running the government starting me yeah there were a lot of I think men have done okay I think they've done okay over time amazing hero knows men men wah-wah-wah-wah all of the arguments by the way that have ever been made all of the sexist chauvinistic arguments or that you know women are more prone to be emotional and paint with a broad brush and you know that that's why they can't be in public life and then mazie Hirono just goes that i hate all the men well and then but then that actually isn't even the least serious thing she's she's done all day she goes on and someone asks her okay you're saying that these allegations of Brett Kavanaugh against Brett Kavanaugh are are fair they're real we should believe them what could Brett Kavanaugh do to prove them wrong and to exculpate himself here's what she says about what if anything could judge Kavanaugh stay in this yearing that would convince you that he didn't do what he's accused of he is saying that he didn't do it what else can he say so I set that aside and I look at what dr. Ford is saying and we've all said she makes a very credible claim so nothing you can do nothing what could Cavanaugh do to exculpate himself well he nothing nothing he can't say anything I don't believe anything he said even though he has an unimpeachable career in the public eye he's been a judge for 12 years but yeah okay I don't believe anything he said but then a woman who refuses to testify to speak to anybody on the record no witnesses the only witnesses that she can even muster up say it never happened calls it absolutely nuts that's the woman that we have to believe that is not a serious person mazie Hirono but it's also not a credible allegation you heard that word did you hear that she said that at the incredible these are credible allegations she's a credible accuser and this is a point on language that I think we all need to pay attention to you know they say brevity is the soul of wit so I try to always use an economy of words and when I write things and I bring this up a lot I did a Praeger video on the importance of language Democrats pervert the culture and pervert our politics by twisting language and we let them get away with it they just say slogans that are not true that distort reality that pervert reality and we let them get away with it sometimes we start using that language too and that's over time perverts the culture so I'd like it pointed I wrote a column on this a few days ago I talked about it on the show I never thought the allegations were credible even if the woman's not lying or even if she's misremembering or what I'm just saying the allegation itself is not credible why because there's no evidence for it it was made well after the fact in the heat of a political moment no witnesses the story has changed nothing about it is credible the Democrats have insisted from the beginning it's a credible allegations credible it's credible when we see this now they've got their talking points Dan Pfeiffer who's on one of those Lefty podcasts he's an old Obama bro he tweets out quote credibly accused sexual assailant Donald Trump put incredibly accused sexual assailant Brett Kavanaugh in the Supreme Court tells you everything you need to know about the Republican Party mm-hmm now what is credible mean here what it was credibly accused Donald Trump paid off a porn star apparently he paid off some other model or something I don't think stormy Daniels has accused him of assault I don't think any of the other public people have accused him of assault there are a lot of accusations that are surrounding a lot of these people but where is where is the credibility what what is grand obviously the brick haven't I think is absurd from susan kenedy fantasy at CNN quote it is worth pondering that if this doesn't make a difference and good money says it won't two of the nine justices of the US Supreme Court will have been credibly accused of serious sexual misconduct what a statement to the women of this country now she's referring to Clarence Thomas who in 1991 same exact thing happened he was about to go through and at the last minute they sprung up some allegation of sexual harassment by a woman named Anita Hill even though I need a hill it worked with him for a long time there had never been tours were open they've never heard anything about this I couldn't get good witnesses on it they totally railroaded him and it really damaged his reputation needlessly Brendan Nyhan who's a New York Times contributor quote imagine the reaction to future Supreme Court rulings on women's rights if two of five justices in the majority and the president have been credibly accused of sexual misconduct credibly accused credibly accused credibly they got their talking points today but that tweet sums up what this is really about because likely Cavanaugh is gonna get through I don't see how he's not gonna get through and a lot of insiders are saying within a week truly there's gonna be nothing left to this allegation but what they want to be able to do is once Cavanaugh is through be able to run for the rest of his life and say oh Cavett he was accused of sexual assault he's a rapist he's a rapist I mean there's no no evidence for any of that at all not even in the accusation but that's what they're gonna run on especially when it gets down to abortion questions and and Cory Robb and a lefty writer wrote quote if Cavanaugh is confirmed that means every 5-4 opinion authored by the courts conservative majority will include two men credibly accused of sexual harassment if that doesn't call into question the legitimacy of the institution and the rule of law blah blah blah blah blah he's underlining all of this he's saying haha we're about to undermine the legitimacy our of our institutions which they've been doing since 2016 and then Paul Krugman Paul Krugman former Enron adviser Paul Krugman writing in The New York Times quote once upon a time catching a Supreme Court nominee in a pretty obvious lie at the same time he's being credibly accused of other deceptions probably have been disqualifying but this is the modern GOP Paul Krugman a member of the party of Bill Clinton John F Kennedy FDR Ted Kennedy all the Kennedys Anthony Weiner keith Ellison okay okay buddy sure the thing that so we need to pay attention to this really closely because when you hear this language I think a lot of times people hear credibly accused credibly accused it's on all the news shows and they'll just say it they'll just spout it if you're a Democrat if you're a moderate of your centrist even some Republicans credit oh it's credible credible credit no no no that was just made up they pulled that out of thin air a Democrat communications firm which is likely advising that the party is involved here he said okay you got to use this credibly and well if they do this with videos whenever we have evidence of Democrats being degenerates on video they say oh it was a heavily edited video video is edited by definition all video is edited you started at a certain place you ended at another place you upload it you put it somewhere all video is that if they say heavily edited as if to mean untrue and they're saying credible accusations as if to say these are true allegations and there's no evidence for that at all you've got to pay careful attention because while we're talking about this well we're debating this this is the this is a worse part of the whole situation is they they have us playing on their territory so I think we've got to just put an end to it make this vote happen get past Kavanagh get past this nomination because the the actual headline today is that unemployment joblessness has hit a record low it is at the lowest level that it's been since 1969 that's under the economy of President Donald Trump what else has happened or stock market has hit a record high the Dow jumped 250 points today why is that because investors are not worried about the trade war that the Democrats told us was imminent that was on us right now and sober Republican said is not a real worry the economy has never been better it has never been better things are going great in this country and they've got us arguing about a 36 year old allegation where the woman can't say where it happened why it happened who was there she changes her story it only comes out at the 11th hour she won't she wants to testify she won't testify we're talking about that nonsense that pure fiction that they have crafted when we could be talking about the real economy around us the real political achievements of this administration and they're trying to play that for the midterms we should we should stop it stop all this nonsense give us give us a vote put him on the Supreme Court and move on because things are going very well I have I'm very very lucky to have one of the great figure is probably the most famous lawyer who isn't on the Supreme Court in the country a figure from all of our childhood Ken Starr who has he employed Brett Kavanaugh and a lot of the players actually who were in in the news cycles today he's been a judge he's been all over the place in politics and he's got a new book out contempt about the Clinton administration and the a special prosecutor investigation is the Independent Counsel investigation the Monica Lewinsky affair and on and on and on Ken Starr joins us to discuss his new book and everything else going on in the news all of which seems to involve him judge Starr thank you so much for being here my great pleasure thank you for having me on so judge story you have a unique vantage point I think in DC as you have held just about every important role and every role that we're seeing in the news cycle right now DC Circuit Court of Appeals judge Solicitor General Independent Counsel where you employed Brett Kavanaugh professor university president Chancellor now the author of contempt which I very very much enjoyed I urge everybody who is a political junkie to read it and not just that anybody who is confused by this news cycle to read it because it explains a lot of things that even I couldn't quite put together and also for Millennials I know a lot of Millennials watch the show judge story you are a central figure in our childhoods you were plastered all over television for all of our childhoods so to begin I want to begin with the job itself and then we can use that to go into the news cycle Cavan on and all of that there is a difference between an independent counsel a special counsel and a special prosecutor you very famously served as independent counsel during the Clinton administration and you write in the book that when you were offered the job you didn't think the job should exist you disagreed with the law that created the job so tell it tell us about that about the job and how it fits into our constitutional framework yeah and the constitutional point is very important but it's also very important at a practical operational level so it has both theoretical importance and practical importance under the Independent Counsel law I was appointed to serve as special prosecutor later named independent counsel as the law that Congress passed as amended by three judges to conduct an investigation of the President of the United States Bob Muller our current special counsel in the news is appointed not by three judges but he's appointed consistent with the traditions of our country and our law by the Attorney General of the United States are in this instance the acting Attorney General Rod Rosenstein I've learned that distinction of who appoint and then who ultimately can fire and who can guide and supervise lies all the practical and constitutional difference in the world I did not like the statute under which I was appointed because I felt and continue to feel that the appointing Authority for executive branch functions such as prosecutions of possible federal crimes should come from within the executive branch all is really responsible to the president the issue has always been for how much independence should this outsider brought in to conduct an investigation of the president or those most around him or her have and what the Independent Counsel law did was to say we want greater independence less of a connection to the Justice Department we're not going to cut the Justice Department out of the process entirely so my final point I was appointed by three judges but at the request of the Attorney General under the law Janet Reno who is President Clinton's Attorney General so under the statute the Congress passed in 1978 is a post watergate scandal reform a special division of judges was set up they would do the appointing but they rolled into operation only at the request of the Attorney General so under the statute passed by Congress in the wake of the Watergate scandal a law passed in 1978 three judges had the appointing power but they rolled into action only upon the request of the Attorney General who had information that oh something needs to be looked into an Independent Counsel should be appointed but I the Attorney General can't do the appointing and so the three judges on this special panel asked me to serve so let the record show as we stand along I didn't volunteer for the job but I was asked to serve and I did sir that's how I feel about my job as well as I didn't volunteer for this all this abuse here at the Daily wire so on that point because that really does clear things up I think a lot of people see these terms and they don't see the distinction the distinction between who appoints whom and where this falls III I'm not I'm not asking you to be too much of a political pundit but as you observe the Muller investigation all of the accusations from both sides from the President and from Democrats and from the left how do you think the investigation seems to be going should it wrap up are there calls for it to wrap up should it keep going on past the midterms how do you see it so far I think Bob Muller is doing his job and I have encouraged the president to leave him alone stop using I know exactly a good good luck yeah did you tweet it to him yeah that maybe that might that might send the message but no I I wanna I'm booked I love my country I want my president to succeed whether I agree or disagree with the president I want the president to do a good job and one of the messages in the book is that if you see I campaigned to demonize the prosecutor guess where that started it started in the Clinton years and in fact the Trump team has been reported to say we're just taking a play from the Bill Clinton playbook demonize the prosecutor and do everything you can to stand in the way deny delay and so forth now that having been said from what I have read Bob Mahler notwithstanding all the rhetoric and all the tweets has enjoyed the cooperation of the president and the president's team there's a huge issue as soon as the president going to be interviewed or not but the interview of the president if it happens would come only toward the end of the process so now to come back to your basic question I think Bob Mahler is if anything he's winding down in terms of the investigation of collusion now what we don't know is whether the Attorney General here the acting Attorney General rod Rosen Stein has expanded Bob Muller's investigation we know of course that is investigation immediately took him to Paul Manafort right and so there weren't just questions involving George papadopolis my general Flynn which had to do with the possibility of connections with the Trump campaign with Russian operatives or Russian interests getting the guilty plea recently this last week from Paul Manafort is enormous ly helpful to Paul Manafort I - mr. Muller yes mr. Muller - Bob Muller for obvious reasons not only to save time energy resources and so forth having to go into trial trials role is uncertain you never know what's going to happen but here's the key point Bob Millar now enjoys the full cooperation least that's what's called for into the agreement Paul Manafort so that helps get to the bottom of the whole issue of Russian collusion let me well okay I've seen no evidence of Russian collusion I know about the we all know about the Trump Tower meeting in June of 2016 but I think that's been pretty much flushed out and no charges have been brought at least thus far against anyone on the basis of that meeting and I want to return to what you mentioned the the Bill Clinton of it all the the Clinton playbook of it all because reading your book I really love it it's a trip down memory lane for me to my childhood and I'm seeing all of these characters crop up again rot Rosenstein crops up a lot of other people who we see in politics and of course the Clintons and Hillary Clinton in particular you don't paint a great picture of them including in the title of the book contempt how much of this owes to the Clintons how much did the Clinton administration and their handling of your work in particular but obviously other issues too how much did that poison our politics and lead to our currently toxic political environment I think it contributed to what President Clinton himself called the politics of personal destruction politics is a tough sport right James Stewart the Bueller surprised winning author of a book entitled bloodsport about the whole whitewater of fear before the trials began in Little Rock and our 14 convictions guilty pleas and so forth but what the Clintons did was to treat people with contempt for example monocle when treated with contempt right it wasn't just a denial it was he was the stalker she was narcissistic I mean there are different allegations and accusations made against her Paul of bourbon Jones who brought a sexual harassment lawsuit that sounds pretty familiar right a sexual harassment lawsuit again President Clinton for his actions that she likes occurred in Arkansas during the time he was governor well wanted huntin surrogates say the most demeaning thing she's trailer-park track and you imagine that and yet the culture was coarsened we think the culture is some of us have concerns about the directions of the culture but I will say this I was done that Bill Clinton personally and the people around Bill Clinton but demonized women who had had either a consensual relationship with the President or in the case of one eat abroad wreck a very colorful allegation that she had been raped and I mean raped by William Jefferson Clinton when he was Attorney General the state of Arkansas and one of the things that I don't say in the book even though I praise so many people in the press yes I praise so many people in the press is being truth seekers and one of those crews I'm gonna have to ask you about that afterward but please go on okay what yeah what yeah I'm sure I'm going on shut me up and I think that true no no please and Kooten well thank you included Lisa Myers of NBC News who first uncovered the story of the alleged rape and NBC News would not allow that to air now think of it now especially with social media now remember this is the time when some pretty famous and powerful people other than Bill Clinton we're doing some very nasty things and the workplace right and all these things are now coming out and and and and I think it's a healthy thing now I'm going to say this especially in light of the Brett Kavanaugh situation I believe in Brett Kavanaugh I totally respect him I've known him for so many years he was with me at my side during many years of the investigation we practice law together and I think the outpouring of support for him suggests that we are a long long well he just absolutely denied that this alleged episode ever happened with this person or with with with anyone anyone anywhere but you're so right it's one of the messages of the book I think we've grown up in certain respect as a couple and that question of the media and of Cavanaugh because I suppose you're right I suppose I can agree there are some some members of the media who are truth seekers though it's hard to find them these days and I remember even as a kid the media destroyed you I mean they targeted you you went from being criticized by Republicans as a squish as being too moderate to being this right-wing rock-ribbed knuckle drag within two days because the White House turned its attention on you in the media followed suit we're seeing this all the way up through a judge Cavanaugh now judge Cavanaugh has a lift with his apparently unimpeachable life this that you know we should all be so lucky that the worst our enemies could drag up on us is this story heard for the first time 35 years later but what is the media's role in all of this has that media role changed did it change under the Clinton administration or have they always been Bulldogs for one political view over the other for the Democrats over the Republicans yeah I have a more benign view of the press they're always going to be bad apples are gonna be partisans who have journalistic journal one might resonate credentials all right so they have credentials hey I'm a journalist I'm with newspaper X or media platform why but I'm very Jeffersonian about this so Jefferson hated the Federalists dominated press and was eager for more anti federalist newspapers to get started and so forth and yet he wisely knew we've got to have the Free Press we've got to have an aggressive free press so all I say is be careful who you're listening to assessment but always ask the question and am i hearing the truth am i hearing facts or am i hearing spent and what the and every White House says it's probably and operation I understand that but what Bill Clinton did with his operatives the James Carville's at the time to George Stephanopoulos and so forth those folks were masters at the art the evil and dark part of spinning a narrative but in the process I don't think Stephanopoulos ever do this but Carville definitely did he made sport of attacking people and so didn't Hillary Clinton Bill Clinton was much more elegant about it obviously he's naturally charming and charismatic guy I pay tribute to his many political gifts in the West but Hillary is cut from a different cloth she turned her back on her upbringing in the suburbs of Chicago when she went to Wellesley she became a radicalized you say oh that's a terrible thing to say no as I described in the book she became a follower and student of Saul Alinsky the author of rules for radicals and what is one of the rules for radicals no not rules for Christians rules for thoughtful secularists rules for kind a theist rules for radical and wants one of the key rules of radicals attack and destroy mm-hmm attack and destroy and lie lie lie on in the book you talk about how she was so brazen in saying I don't remember I don't know I don't recall I don't remember that you considered charging her with perjury III if I'm getting that right you got a right and thank you for noting that because you know part of the meta-narrative is host I found nothing in Arkansas and then went after the president because of a private consensual relationship so we all know that narrative even if you were a child you now know I mean that's just part of our modern history right totally wrong and so one of the reasons I wrote the book my memoir is to set the record straight to complete the records and here is a fact not fiction and I spent 14 criminal convictions in Arkansas and then most relevantly in light of your comment we seriously considered going before the grand jury a little Rock Arkansas in the spring of 1998 it's a and died Hillary Rodham plug but we made a professional judgment that we did not have the evidence sufficient evidence to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that she committed these offences so she was a very lucky person she should be down on her knees thank yous that image at night saying thank you dear Lord that for what I did that I was not prosecuted by the Independent Counsel absolutely and that image of Hillary Clinton on her knees praying I don't know does the does the saying go the angels take care of their own or I don't know it's a it's a different thing than that I don't know I don't know who she's praying to exactly I think the angels take care of drunks and lawyers that's right but and it's a you know throughout the book I love that you continually return to what is the truth we are after the truth everyone you're speaking to Monica Lewinsky whoever it is we're after the truth and it's something that maybe there isn't enough of these days so I really encourage people to read the book because you know I think a lot of us saw it on TV and we were told a certain narrative of what happened and and those issues are still affecting us today and it's it's important to get that record right judge sure I've taken up far too much of your time so I'll let you go thank you so much for being here though I really appreciate it oh great pleasure and thank you for promoting the book it's in many respects it's the cry from the heart about our country and how good our country is and that our system of law does in fact work it can be quite ugly a time but ugliness is not our system of law the ugliness is the human condition the human being in our system but our system is very structurally sound may we keep our system of a constitutional republic dr. Franklin asked us to do that on Constitution Day September 17 1787 may we continue to guard and love our constitutional republic amen Ken Starr one of the most insightful people in our public life so we've got a lot more to get to we have a whole mailbag today and I'm gonna I'm gonna get through all of them probably I want but I'm gonna try to get through all so if you are at daily wire calm thank you very much you help us keep the lights on in Co FFA in my cup if you were on Facebook and YouTube get out of there man get over to daily wire it's ten bucks a month $100 for an annual membership you get me you get the Andrew Klavan show you get the Ben Shapiro show you test questions in the mailbag like the one that's just coming up you get to ask questions in the conversation you get everything you get everything that you could ever want most importantly the leftist here's tumblr you get the mazie Hirono tumblr you but the man it's the men very very good Thank You senator Hirono go to daily we are calm we'll be right back with the mailbag let's jump right in from our room dear dr. Kofi Feng I often hear my leftist acquaintances of Caucasian descent say check your priveledge to each other what does this mean I honestly have never been quite sure what to make of this ridiculous phrase could you please explain it and deconstruct it for me yes it means shut up check your priveledge means shut up that's the only way that it has ever used that's all that it implies that's the only action that is requested by that phrase check your priveledge means shut up it means you have an opinion that I can't refute or argue against so I'm going to on the basis of your race or your sex or if you're a man who thinks he's a man or a woman who thinks she's a woman tell you to shut up so shut up that's what it means the reason that it's prevalent among left-wing circles is because everybody's got to serve somebody and leftist politics is a jealous angry God which will have no God before it so it replaces religion you know we've talked about this with environmentalism environmentalism global warming has all of the trappings of religion it has original sin and in the form of pollution it has indulgences in the form of carbon tax credits yet there are works that you can do there are you know there are things that you can do to bring yourself closer to the God mother nature Gaia whatever you want to call it earth day whatever this is also true in the check your priveledge in the intersectionality politics of identity race sex whatever which is that when they walk around and say check your priveledge it's a sort of inversion of maiya colpa Mia culpa mea Maxima culpa you know when you begin a mass you call to mind your sins and you say have sinned I confess my sins to you my brothers and sisters please pray for me to the Lord our God in in this case you're flipping and you're saying you're a sinner you're us you're bad you've committed the sin of being white you've committed the sin of being a man you've committed the sin of being a man who thinks he's a man you've committed the sin of being a man who's attracted to women and so it's an inversion it's a it's angry and you know it's not very charitable it's not very graceful it's not very loving but it is a feature of the of leftism and you should ignore it it's stupid it's ridiculous I never I'm kind of lucky because I'm I'm just swarthy enough you know I don't know where I fall in the privileged scale i but you would even see this sometimes I think people in colleges for instance who come from financial aid you know my family did not have a lot of money and I was on financial aid and I would notice this in college anyone who's a Republican this pilloried is being rich or coming from a lot of money or whatever and the impulse is to say no I didn't I didn't come from a lot of money I came from humble backgrounds I've had tough things in my life I think it's a huge mistake I don't think you should do that you should never engage with those hateful arguments if you get into a fight with a skunk it doesn't matter if you win you're gonna end up smelling very very bad don't give those premises away don't acknowledge the privileged thing just laugh at it laugh at it move on from Zachary dear Michael Corleone Al Pacino look-alike Noel's hooah big man excuse me I recently had an argument to prove God prove God to a friend of mine and the question came up that I really couldn't answer so I'll pose it to you if God can see the future and knows how it goes why create anything in the first place it's an interesting question that this hasn't occurred to me and it is worth noting you can't prove God you can make arguments for God but God is the basis of all meaningful speech so it sort of begs the question even those arguments but there were good arguments for God there's a lot of evidence for God the question is why would you create anything at all if you know how it's going to end how else could you create anything what are you talking about any artist who creates a work of art knows how it ends by definition because he creates the art so he creates the ending of it he's out of court if you're outside of time and space if you're outside of creation then you know about creation you know everything about creation but what what work of art would you create where you didn't know how it ended could you write a novel and not know how it ends could you make a movie and not know how it ends could you paint a picture and not know how it ends not know everything about it of course not Myra the relationship between God and man and is similar to the relationship between Shakespeare and Hamlet but Hamlet is the creation of Shakespeare he's outside of the book Shakespeare knows how Hamlet ends I won't spoil it for you if you haven't read it but of course I I don't I don't see that objection at all in fact that objection seems to me a good argument for God as we know God and there's a there's an extra part of the story because then the creator enters into the creation enters into the story and makes the greatest story ever told but you got to read you got to read past the first chapters to get to that part from Spencer o Knowles who knows how do you think we can maintain a sense of purpose whether as a society or as individuals if we reach a point by technological advances advances that will render work largely superfluous Spencer we won't because we're creative human beings are creative and so there's never a point at which we won't want to work Adam in the garden in perfection was given a job and he worked it is in our nature to work when people don't work they atrophy and fall away and die they spiritually and sometimes physically that now does that mean that I'm gonna at some point there won't be a robot that can clean my house yeah there's probably gonna be a robot that can clean my house that's great because then I can work on other things like not writing books maybe you ask the wrong guy this question but even if there is certain work that is automated that will just create other work because we are creative people and this is when people talk about artificial intelligence they say speak of the human mind is if the human mind is just a computer that only exists to solve problems presented to it that is such a misunderstanding of the human mind the human mind is creative we are made in the image of God the Creator and we are creative we essentially create there there is no robot that is going to stop me from creating or stop my impulse from creating that's that's a it you know in a very essential way what makes us human from Patrick to Knowles at all the other day I overheard someone who calls themselves asexual freethinker asking why consensual incest is wrong it was made very clear that he doesn't put any stock toward religions teaching on this and our moral viewpoints should be challenged on a regular basis by an honest and unbiased viewpoint he also mentioned that the argument for preventing the mental and physical dysfunctions brought on by such relations was a eugenic one and would effectively close off certain people from reproducing because it would likely result in the same thing this is this in mind how would you argue against this line of thought thanks and love to show Patrick what is unbiased thinking tell me what unbiased thinking is what what moral vision does not take into account metaphysics morals aren't a physical thing I can't this isn't a moral well leftist ears have a lot of moral value but they're not morals themselves and morals aren't a physical thing they are metaphysical things so when we discuss morality we discuss metaphysics which is in the realm of philosophy and theology and religion so if he says I want to discuss metaphysics without discussing metaphysics then he's a dumb-dumb and should realize the error of his ways but to the question itself why should consensual why is consensual incest wrong this has cropped up in a lot of news stories some teacher just got fired for asking this question to his students this has come up in a number of colleges and philosophy and psychology classes why is it wrong well you can't I suppose you can look at physical evidence which is that the kids are more likely to have disabilities and dysfunctions in them but even ignoring that why is it wrong in itself let's say that they used perfect sexual protection you know pills and prophylactics and this and that the other thing just the Union itself why is that it's because it is an attack on the family it attacks familial love it is unnatural it is against natural law which does exist and when we talk about natural rights we talk about human rights the only way that human rights and natural rights make any sense is if we talk about a natural law from which we can to which we can associate them so it is wrong now what is the if your friend says he doesn't want a moral argument for why it's immoral then I can't help him very much but if he's asking for something that is beyond the realm of metaphysics the only help I could give him is something that leon kass who's a terrific bioethicists genius out of UChicago he wrote out an essay about this probably 20 years ago about the wisdom of and I'm not saying that this should be the entirety of your argument for why incest is wrong but this might be a good starting point if you don't want to rise to the higher levels of philosophy or theology or whatever which is that there are certain things that we just feel to be wrong we feel it is wrong to watch a boy murder his grandmother you know or sleep with his sister or we see assaults on the family is wrong why is that it's something built into us certainly and there are two ways of approaching this it seems your friend is approaching it and saying well if I can't it rationally explained right now with his apparently limited rational faculties why it's wrong then it can't be wrong and then there's another way of approaching it which is why do I feel this way why does it seem to me into every great thinker ever that this is wrong perhaps they were on to something it's Chesterton's fence there there are two reformers you know you if you drive up in the middle of the wilderness and you see a white fence just right in the middle of nowhere one type of reformer says I see no reason for that fence to be there pull it down but the wiser reformer says before you pull that fence down you need to explain to me why that fence is there it when you explain to me why that fence is there then you can tell me why we should pull it down and this is the case with an issue like this and it's a broader point on politics this is something that the left and right differ on because I think and I'm firmly on the right I think that I could explain most of the views most of the opinions of the left most of my friends on though I've got a lot of friends on probably most of my friends would call themselves left wingers and I think that I understand and could explain most of their opinions and I think they could not explain most of my opinions that should tell you something you should be able to understand the other point of view before you refute it we still get some time from our room I bet that's the same Arun I don't think there are a lot of our UN's watching the show dear dr. Co FFA should we it's definitely the same one should we grant citizenship or permanent residency to immigrants who express consistently anti-american views in public like taking in me or calling America racist both my parents are immigrants from India and on the rare occasions when people in our community disparage America or the flag it bothers us that they are denigrating the country that gave us everything we have again the sentiment is rare but should people with these views be permitted to become citizens or should they just be judged on their economic merits thanks and may your cup overflow with Coe FFA yeah we should not allow those people to become citizens if you don't love the country you should not be allowed to become a citizen if you're already a citizen that's too bad I guess you know we'll have to deal with that but absolutely not but there are a couple points of view on this the one is this total open borders just you know make an idol at a free trade and what would be called globalism or imperialism which says yeah if you can add to our GDP by point zero zero zero two percent who cares if you're a Nazi come on into the country who cares if you hate our country who cares if you want to undercut our country and there's another view that says no in order to join the country you have to love the country you have to love what it's about you need to support it you need to know something about it you need to be brought into it that is the view people who don't love America should not be permitted to become Americans it's as simple as that and if they're here already and they're not citizens butum out get him on the next boat send him home from Andrew hello to the Daily wire representative from the Vatican my question concerns had to deal with selfishness in a relationship I've been single my whole life so I don't have a horse in this race sorry to hear that but my friends and their partners all seem to be focused on what they can get out of the relationship and not about the other person I was wondering what is the best way to quell these selfish tendencies also I could use some advice on how to get into the dating game as I've not yet participated in it for all 18 years of my life thanks love the superior daily wire podcast you have good taste sir it I find this is in to use conservative philosophy and public policy and economics it's very easy it's much easier to channel one's bad tendencies into a good tendency than to just try to stomp them out altogether so my argument for why you shouldn't be selfish in a romantic relationship or a marriage is that it will hurt you that hits that you're ultimately being self sacrificial or altom being self-destructive if you do that selfishness in a relationship will poison the relationship it will poison your life you will be miserable you will not you will look back on your relationship and think gosh what a waste of opportunity what a selfish little Ruffy and I was what word am I looking for a little bug that I was if you really are looking out for your own interests then in a relationship in a marriage you should be selfless and then you'll have a better time and your life will be better and you will grow and love and you will be have a smile on your pillow every night and you will wake up feeling joyful if you want to look out for your own self interests in a relationship don't be selfish from Matthew good day mr. Coe FFA was public speaking ever difficult for you assuming someone is not naturally charismatic how much of getting better at public speaking is just practicing it over and over and how much is it conquering your fear of failure or worry of what people think of you what is the relationship between this experience and this fear thanks big fan so I don't remember too much about when I was a baby but I have heard that I spoke at a very young age I think I observe started speaking at 11 months or something so there might be a national natural component to speaking publicly or being comfortable speaking and so perhaps some people are less naturally fit for that than others but I think much more important than that is practice and training over time you know i've i recommend acting classes to everybody i think it's very helpful it helps you understand characters it helps you study the human nature it helps you participate in an artistic field it gets you better at speaking it gets you better at knowing just the muscles of speaking sometimes people on twitter will make fun of me for enunciate we're having precise diction i've i've taken a lot of diction classes that's just the way I talk you know and it's good because then people can understand you more easily so I think you can overcome that very easily some of our great orators had speech problems Winston Churchill had a speech problem I don't think Abraham Lincoln was you know from the age of 2 just spouting off and listening to the sound of his own voice I don't think he was doing vaudeville shows or anything like that it can come with practice and and with practice then you have to have been you gain and confidence but it is a muscle it's a muscle like anything else a little a little pro tip here if you're ever doing a university play or something like that I think a lot of people when they're trying to memorize lines they just read them in their head so they'll have the script up and then just read them in their head and you won't that you won't memorize lines very effectively that way the way that you most effectively memorize lines is to say them in a very exaggerated way so you know for a question you could say dear Michael president cough FA dot that that that and you do that because there is a certain muscle memory and you'll and it will trigger other things people e in our culture a lot of people just want to have a rationalist view of everything to have everything abstracted and in the ethereal realm but you got to put it into your body and when you put it into your body it'll become a lot easier for you as for all right I'll get to I'll get to that and I'll get to the the next part of that if it pops up in another question from Kyle Michael I'm in college and there are a few girls in my classes that I'm interested in dating switch colleges dude one of the reasons why I haven't asked one of them out is because I do not have a car I could call an uber to pick her up walk take the bus or have her drive us I don't do this because I feel like it is my traditional responsibility to provide the transportation the real answer here is me Manning up and asking one of them out but then it comes to what is the most proper way for us to get around town thank you and I can't wait for your next Valentine's Day conversation Kyle don't worry about it you're in college don't worry about a car I never had a car in college I didn't have a car when I lived in the city I wouldn't worry about that depends if you're gonna go to a bar or a restaurant or something that's near where you and she live then you can walk I think that's perfectly fine or take an uber taking ubers are great because then you can drink a lot and not worry about killing somebody that's a win-win the this though does get to a point that I've talked about before when people ask me for dating advice you're not going to ask a girl out even if you like a girl even if you think she's cute and you think she's smart and funny or whatever because you're worried that you won't impress her by not having a car you're just thinking about you forget about that who cares what is it a bet is it about you showing off to a or isn't about you getting the girl get the girl dude get the girl I hope that helps I'll do one more one more I'm sorry I'm doing it too bad from Marc Michael your article here's all of the evidence
