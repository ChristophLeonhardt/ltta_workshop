LONG ISLAND, NEW YORK, AN AREA

10
00:00:20,404 --> 00:00:23,340
HIT HARD BY THE MURDEROUS MS-13

11
00:00:23,340 --> 00:00:24,208
GANG.

12
00:00:24,208 --> 00:00:28,412
>> WE ARE HERE TODAY TO DISCUSS

13
00:00:28,412 --> 00:00:30,781
THE MENACE OF MS-13.

14
00:00:30,781 --> 00:00:31,782
IT'S A MENACE.

15
00:00:31,782 --> 00:00:34,018
THEY EXPLOITED THE LOOPHOLES IN

16
00:00:34,018 --> 00:00:37,988
OUR LAWS TO ENTER THE COUNTRY AS

17
00:00:37,988 --> 00:00:39,190
UNACCOMPANIED ALIEN MINORS.

18
00:00:39,190 --> 00:00:40,825
THEY LOOKED SO INNOCENT.

19
00:00:40,825 --> 00:00:42,026
THEY ARE NOT INNOCENT.

20
00:00:42,026 --> 00:00:44,095
CRIPPLING LOOPHOLES IN OUR LAWS

21
00:00:44,095 --> 00:00:46,797
HAVE ENABLED MS-13 GANG MEMBERS

22
00:00:46,797 --> 00:00:49,400
AND OTHER CRIMINALS TO

23
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:50,401
INFILTRATE OUR COMMUNITIES.

24
00:00:50,401 --> 00:00:51,135
AND DEMOCRATS IN CONGRESS

25
00:00:51,135 --> 00:00:54,505
REFUSED TO CLOSE THESE LOOPHOLES

26
00:00:54,505 --> 00:00:56,240
REFUSED TO CLOSE THESE LOOPHOLE

27
00:00:56,240 --> 00:00:56,607
LOOPHOLES.

28
00:00:56,607 --> 00:00:57,775
INCLUDING THE DISGRACEFUL

29
00:00:57,775 --> 00:00:59,110
PRACTICE KNOWN AS CATCH AND

30
00:00:59,110 --> 00:01:00,010
RELEASE.

31
00:01:00,010 --> 00:01:01,979
35 THE PRESIDENT CALLING OUT

32
00:01:01,979 --> 00:01:04,181
DEMOCRATS WHO HE SAYS CAME TO

33
00:01:04,181 --> 00:01:06,283
THE DEFENSE OF MS-13 GANG

34
00:01:06,283 --> 00:01:08,753
MEMBERS AFTER HE CALLED THEM

35
00:01:08,753 --> 00:01:09,120
ANIMALS.

36
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:13,891
>> I NOTICED RECENTLY WHERE

37
00:01:13,891 --> 00:01:15,359
DEMOCRATS NANCY PELOSI AS AN

38
00:01:15,359 --> 00:01:19,497
EXAMPLE ARE TRYING TO DEFEND

39
00:01:19,497 --> 00:01:20,030
MS-13 GANG MEMBERS.

40
00:01:20,030 --> 00:01:25,169
I CALL THEM ANIMALS.

41
00:01:25,169 --> 00:01:28,105
AND I WAS MET WITH REBUKE.

42
00:01:28,105 --> 00:01:29,974
THEY SAID THEY ARE PEOPLE.

43
00:01:29,974 --> 00:01:32,209
THEY ARE NOT PEOPLE.

44
00:01:32,209 --> 00:01:33,144
THESE ARE ANIMALS.

45
00:01:33,144 --> 00:01:37,047
AND WE HAVE TO BE VERY, VERY

46
00:01:37,047 --> 00:01:38,616
TOUGH.

47
00:01:38,616 --> 00:01:40,651
>> Kimberly: MEANWHILE, A

48
00:01:40,651 --> 00:01:41,418
LOCAL POLICE COMMISSIONER

49
00:01:41,418 --> 00:01:43,788
SOUNDING THE ALARM ON JUST HOW

50
00:01:43,788 --> 00:01:46,056
DANGEROUS THESE GANGS ARE

51
00:01:46,056 --> 00:01:49,527
COMMUNITIES.

52
00:01:49,527 --> 00:01:49,994
>> WE NEED HELP.

53
00:01:49,994 --> 00:01:51,195
WHEN WE HAVE 40% OF OUR

54
00:01:51,195 --> 00:01:55,699
HOMICIDES ON MS-13 RELATED AND

55
00:01:55,699 --> 00:01:58,369
OUT OF THE SIX THEY COMMITTED,

56
00:01:58,369 --> 00:02:00,404
FOUR OF THEM WERE BUTCHERS WITH

57
00:02:00,404 --> 00:02:02,773
MACHETES AND BURIED IN SHALLOW

58
00:02:02,773 --> 00:02:03,107
GRAVES.

59
00:02:03,107 --> 00:02:04,608
THE FAMILIES CAN'T IDENTIFY AND

60
00:02:04,608 --> 00:02:05,409
CAN FIND THEM.

61
00:02:05,409 --> 00:02:06,644
WE NEED THAT SUPPORT FOR THE

62
00:02:06,644 --> 00:02:07,578
PRESIDENT.

63
00:02:07,578 --> 00:02:08,846
HE IS SUPPORTING OUR ENFORCEMENT

64
00:02:08,846 --> 00:02:09,180
EFFORTS.

65
00:02:09,180 --> 00:02:12,183
WE CAN ALSO USE SOME FUNDING.

66
00:02:12,183 --> 00:02:13,551
>> Kimberly: THE PRESIDENT

67
00:02:13,551 --> 00:02:15,586
TACKLING THIS ISSUE HEAD-ON,

68
00:02:15,586 --> 00:02:17,021
GREG, AND DOUBLING DOWN.

69
00:02:17,021 --> 00:02:17,989
HE FACED CRITICISM.

70
00:02:17,989 --> 00:02:21,592
HE SAID HE FACED REBUKE FOR

71
00:02:21,592 --> 00:02:22,226
CALLING AND IDENTIFYING

72
00:02:22,226 --> 00:02:24,028
SPECIFICALLY GANG MEMBERS FROM

73
00:02:24,028 --> 00:02:26,230
MS-13, CALLING THEM ANIMALS.

74
00:02:26,230 --> 00:02:27,865
HE REPEATED THAT TODAY.

75
00:02:27,865 --> 00:02:29,267
HAS SOME EVIDENCE TO BACK IT UP

76
00:02:29,267 --> 00:02:31,035
FROM THE LOCAL AUTHORITIES.

77
00:02:31,035 --> 00:02:33,037
>> Greg: POLITICALLY, THIS IS

78
00:02:33,037 --> 00:02:35,173
A BIG WIN FOR HIM.

79
00:02:35,173 --> 00:02:37,575
IN THIS ISSUE, TRUMP'S DANCEABLE

80
00:02:37,575 --> 00:02:38,776
REGISTER.

81
00:02:38,776 --> 00:02:41,913
FOR HIM, MS-13 STANDS FOR "MUST

82
00:02:41,913 --> 00:02:42,413
STOP."

83
00:02:42,413 --> 00:02:45,383
FOR DEMOCRATS IT STANDS FOR

84
00:02:45,383 --> 00:02:46,651
MISUNDERSTOOD.

85
00:02:46,651 --> 00:02:48,219
THE MORE HE SHOWS THE CONTRAST,

86
00:02:48,219 --> 00:02:50,988
THE BETTER IT IS BECAUSE THE

87
00:02:50,988 --> 00:02:51,989
MEDIA AND THE DEMOCRATS,

88
00:02:51,989 --> 00:02:53,391
CONTINUALLY WITH TRUMP THEY GET

89
00:02:53,391 --> 00:02:55,026
BOGGED DOWN IN LANGUAGE, AND

90
00:02:55,026 --> 00:02:55,793
THEY ALWAYS LOSE.

91
00:02:55,793 --> 00:02:58,796
THEY ARE SO WORRIED ABOUT THE

92
00:02:58,796 --> 00:03:00,097
WORDS, AND IT REVEALS LOPSIDED

93
00:03:00,097 --> 00:03:00,631
PRIORITIES.

94
00:03:00,631 --> 00:03:01,933
YOU HAVE A PRESIDENT WORRIED

95
00:03:01,933 --> 00:03:04,435
ABOUT JOBS, TERROR, NORTH KOREA,

96
00:03:04,435 --> 00:03:04,835
GANGS.

97
00:03:04,835 --> 00:03:07,505
MEANWHILE, YOU HAVE ANOTHER SIDE

98
00:03:07,505 --> 00:03:10,408
THAT'S CONCERNED THAT HE CALLS

99
00:03:10,408 --> 00:03:12,176
GANG MEMBERS ANIMALS.

100
00:03:12,176 --> 00:03:14,178
IMAGINE YOUR HOUSE BEING ON FIRE

101
00:03:14,178 --> 00:03:15,580
AND YOUR NEIGHBORS ARE

102
00:03:15,580 --> 00:03:16,247
COMPLAINING THAT THE FIRE

103
00:03:16,247 --> 00:03:18,583
ENGINES ARE TOO LOUD.

104
00:03:18,583 --> 00:03:19,517
THAT'S WHAT THIS IS.

105
00:03:19,517 --> 00:03:21,619
DEMOCRATS WORRYING ABOUT WHAT TO

106
00:03:21,619 --> 00:03:23,187
CALL GANG MEMBERS ARE NEIGHBORS

107
00:03:23,187 --> 00:03:25,122
THING HEY, COULD YOUR FIRE

108
00:03:25,122 --> 00:03:28,292
ENGINES KEEP IT DOWN WHILE THE

109
00:03:28,292 --> 00:03:28,693
HOUSE BURNS?

110
00:03:28,693 --> 00:03:31,862
>> Kimberly: CAN YOU IMAGINE?

111
00:03:31,862 --> 00:03:33,831
THREE ALARMS HERE FOR MS-13.

112
00:03:33,831 --> 00:03:35,399
SOMETHING NEEDS TO BE DONE.

113
00:03:35,399 --> 00:03:36,834
I SAW YOU REACTING TO THE

114
00:03:36,834 --> 00:03:40,371
STATISTICS IN TERMS OF NUMBER OF

115
00:03:40,371 --> 00:03:41,505
HOMICIDES AND THE HEINOUS NATURE

116
00:03:41,505 --> 00:03:42,974
OF THE CRIMES THEY COMMIT.

117
00:03:42,974 --> 00:03:44,809
>> Dana: I TALKED TO A FORMER

118
00:03:44,809 --> 00:03:46,477
PROSECUTOR TODAY WHO DID A LOT

119
00:03:46,477 --> 00:03:48,412
OF THESE CASES, ESPECIALLY IN

120
00:03:48,412 --> 00:03:50,982
MARYLAND, WHO SAID HE THINKS OF

121
00:03:50,982 --> 00:03:51,616
MS-13 AS THE MAFIA OF OUR

122
00:03:51,616 --> 00:03:52,016
GENERATION.

123
00:03:52,016 --> 00:03:53,851
ONE OF THE WAYS THEY HAVE GONE

124
00:03:53,851 --> 00:03:56,187
AFTER THEM IS LIKE THEY USED TO

125
00:03:56,187 --> 00:04:01,492
DO WITH THE MOB, WHICH IS RICO.

126
00:04:01,492 --> 00:04:02,960
I ASKED, WHAT LAWS, THE

127
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:04,395
PRESIDENT SAID TODAY WE NEED

128
00:04:04,395 --> 00:04:05,896
CONGRESS TO DO SOMETHING, WHAT

129
00:04:05,896 --> 00:04:06,631
DO YOU THINK CONGRESS COULD DO

130
00:04:06,631 --> 00:04:08,599
THE GOOD HELP LAW ENFORCEMENT?

131
00:04:08,599 --> 00:04:11,636
HE SAID HE DOES BELIEVE THE LAX

132
00:04:11,636 --> 00:04:12,436
BORDERS OF THE HUGE PROBLEM

133
00:04:12,436 --> 00:04:14,205
BECAUSE OF THE ABILITY TO

134
00:04:14,205 --> 00:04:16,173
REGENERATE AND THEY ARE

135
00:04:16,173 --> 00:04:18,541
RECRUITING AT YOUNGER AND

136
00:04:18,541 --> 00:04:18,976
YOUNGER AGES.

137
00:04:18,976 --> 00:04:21,212
THIS BRUTALITY, HE SAID IT'S

138
00:04:21,212 --> 00:04:23,881
ALMOST ISIS-LIKE THE KILLING,

139
00:04:23,881 --> 00:04:25,216
AND IT IS RATCHETING UP AND

140
00:04:25,216 --> 00:04:26,617
GETTING WORSE.

141
00:04:26,617 --> 00:04:28,886
HE ALSO SAID MS-13 WAS IN ABOUT

142
00:04:28,886 --> 00:04:30,955
TEN STATES IN 2005.

143
00:04:30,955 --> 00:04:35,459
BY THE LATE 2000s IN ALL 50

144
00:04:35,459 --> 00:04:37,595
STATES.

145
00:04:37,595 --> 00:04:39,797
THE THING, I THINK IT'S

146
00:04:39,797 --> 00:04:41,032
IMPORTANT TO BRING ATTENTION TO

147
00:04:41,032 --> 00:04:41,599
IT.

148
00:04:41,599 --> 00:04:42,300
CONNELL McSHANE WHEN HE WAS

149
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:43,668
DOING REPORTING FOR US TODAY,

150
00:04:43,668 --> 00:04:46,103
THERE'S A LOCAL DEMOCRATIC

151
00:04:46,103 --> 00:04:47,038
CONGRESS MEANT WHO IS NOT

152
00:04:47,038 --> 00:04:48,806
INVITED TO TODAY'S MEETING.

153
00:04:48,806 --> 00:04:50,374
I THINK THAT WAS A MISTAKE.

154
00:04:50,374 --> 00:04:52,610
HE SAID HE WOULD HAVE GONE IF HE

155
00:04:52,610 --> 00:04:53,611
HAD BEEN INVITED.

156
00:04:53,611 --> 00:04:55,379
WHY NOT TRY TO CO-OPT SOME OF

157
00:04:55,379 --> 00:04:57,415
THEM, DEMOCRATS, SO THAT YOU CAN

158
00:04:57,415 --> 00:04:59,050
MAKE IT A BIPARTISAN ISSUE.

159
00:04:59,050 --> 00:05:00,418
THESE PEOPLE WANT TO MAKE FUN OF

160
00:05:00,418 --> 00:05:01,819
THE PRESIDENT FIRST THING

161
00:05:01,819 --> 00:05:03,054
ANIMALS, THEY HAVE TO DEAL WITH

162
00:05:03,054 --> 00:05:05,456
THEIR OWN POLITICS ON THAT SIDE.

163
00:05:05,456 --> 00:05:09,360
IF YOU REALLY WANT TO SOLVE THE

164
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:13,431
PROBLEM, YOU NEED DEMOCRATS.

165
00:05:13,431 --> 00:05:14,499
>> Kimberly: GOOD EVENT OF.

166
00:05:14,499 --> 00:05:20,671
IT COULD BE EVEN BETTER.

167
00:05:20,805 --> 00:05:22,940
MS-13 ON LONG ISLAND ALONE.

168
00:05:22,940 --> 00:05:24,275
THE BACKDROP, THE PRESIDENT THAT

169
00:05:24,275 --> 00:05:26,611
SECURE OUR BORDERS, PROTECT OUR

170
00:05:26,611 --> 00:05:27,378
COMMUNITIES.

171
00:05:27,378 --> 00:05:28,412
SOMEONE SAID YOU CAN'T PROTECT

172
00:05:28,412 --> 00:05:30,114
THE COMMUNITY UNTIL YOU SECURE

173
00:05:30,114 --> 00:05:30,781
THE BORDER.

174
00:05:30,781 --> 00:05:32,250
THE PRESIDENT HAS THAT WIDE

175
00:05:32,250 --> 00:05:32,617
VIEW.

176
00:05:32,617 --> 00:05:33,618
THEY DO REGENERATE.

177
00:05:33,618 --> 00:05:34,852
THE CONTRAST BETWEEN THE FOLKS

178
00:05:34,852 --> 00:05:36,654
YELLING ABOUT THE ANIMALS

179
00:05:36,654 --> 00:05:37,622
COMMENT IS THAT THE PRESIDENT

180
00:05:37,622 --> 00:05:40,191
WANTS THE RULE OF LAW VERSUS

181
00:05:40,191 --> 00:05:40,625
LAWLESSNESS.

182
00:05:40,625 --> 00:05:42,593
HE WANTS BORDERS VERSUS OPEN

183
00:05:42,593 --> 00:05:43,261
BORDERS.

184
00:05:43,261 --> 00:05:46,798
HE BELIEVES MERIT-BASED

185
00:05:46,798 --> 00:05:48,867
IMMIGRATION IS BETTER THAN THE

186
00:05:48,867 --> 00:05:53,605
RUSSIAN ROULETTE OF WHO IS

187
00:05:53,605 --> 00:05:56,574
COMING, WHY ARE THEY COMING.

188
00:05:56,574 --> 00:05:57,776
THIS PRESIDENT IDENTIFIES

189
00:05:57,776 --> 00:05:59,511
OPPORTUNITIES TO EXPOSE THE LEFT

190
00:05:59,511 --> 00:06:01,613
AND THE INSANITY THEY PURSUE.

191
00:06:01,613 --> 00:06:03,381
CATCH AND RELEASE, SANCTUARY

192
00:06:03,381 --> 00:06:04,416
CITIES.

193
00:06:04,416 --> 00:06:05,617
MS-13 IS THAT EXAMPLE, AND

194
00:06:05,617 --> 00:06:06,551
EVERYONE KNOWS IT.

195
00:06:06,551 --> 00:06:08,153
IT'S A REAL PROBLEM FOR REAL

196
00:06:08,153 --> 00:06:08,720
PEOPLE IN THEIR LIVES.

197
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:11,323
I THINK HE HAS HIT THE NAIL ON

198
00:06:11,323 --> 00:06:11,690
THE HEAD.

199
00:06:11,690 --> 00:06:14,993
>> Kimberly: UNFORTUNATE

200
00:06:14,993 --> 00:06:16,628
POSITION, THE LEFT, RICHARD,

201
00:06:16,628 --> 00:06:18,396
THOUGH THEY ARE DEFENDING KIND

202
00:06:18,396 --> 00:06:19,531
OF THESE LAWLESS CRIMINALS.

203
00:06:19,531 --> 00:06:23,201
NOW THE PROLIFERATION HAS SPREAD

204
00:06:23,201 --> 00:06:26,538
TO ALL 50 STATES.

205
00:06:26,671 --> 00:06:28,173
SEEMS PERFECTLY APPROPRIATE

206
00:06:28,173 --> 00:06:28,807
BECAUSE THEY ARE DOMESTIC

207
00:06:28,807 --> 00:06:32,010
TERRORISTS IN TERMS OF CRIME,

208
00:06:32,010 --> 00:06:33,011
RACKETEERING, MURDERS THEY CARRY

209
00:06:33,011 --> 00:06:33,278
OUT.

210
00:06:33,278 --> 00:06:34,779
>> Richard: HERE IS MY TAKE ON

211
00:06:34,779 --> 00:06:35,080
THIS.

212
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:37,215
WHEN PRESIDENT TRUMP MADE THE

213
00:06:37,215 --> 00:06:38,616
ANIMALS COMMENT, HE COMPLAINED

214
00:06:38,616 --> 00:06:39,584
HE WAS TAKEN OUT OF CONTEXT, AND

215
00:06:39,584 --> 00:06:42,220
HE WAS.

216
00:06:42,220 --> 00:06:43,221
WHAT YOU'RE DOING WITH

217
00:06:43,221 --> 00:06:45,090
NANCY PELOSI NOW IS TAKING HER

218
00:06:45,090 --> 00:06:45,557
OUT OF CONTEXT.

219
00:06:45,557 --> 00:06:46,491
HER ARGUMENT WITH A LARGER

220
00:06:46,491 --> 00:06:48,493
NARRATIVE ABOUT WHAT THE

221
00:06:48,493 --> 00:06:50,261
PRESIDENT'S RHETORIC ON

222
00:06:50,261 --> 00:06:52,030
IMMIGRATION OVERALL AND HOW THIS

223
00:06:52,030 --> 00:06:53,398
ANIMAL COMMENT BLEEDS INTO THAT

224
00:06:53,398 --> 00:06:53,999
LARGER NARRATIVE.

225
00:06:53,999 --> 00:06:56,234
IT WAS NOTHING TO DO WITH MS-13.

226
00:06:56,234 --> 00:06:58,436
IF YOU ASK ANY DEMOCRAT ON

227
00:06:58,436 --> 00:06:59,804
CAPITOL HILL, THEY WOULD SAY

228
00:06:59,804 --> 00:07:01,106
YES, MS-13 IS HEINOUS.

229
00:07:01,106 --> 00:07:05,276
THEY ARE AWFUL AND THAT'S WHY WE

230
00:07:05,276 --> 00:07:06,144
NEED TO MAKE SURE GANGS LIKE

231
00:07:06,144 --> 00:07:07,645
THAT IN THIS COUNTRY DON'T

232
00:07:07,645 --> 00:07:08,046
SPREAD.

233
00:07:08,046 --> 00:07:09,114
YOU HAVE TO SEPARATE MS-13 FROM

234
00:07:09,114 --> 00:07:13,218
THOSE INDIVIDUALS WHO, FROM THE

235
00:07:13,218 --> 00:07:13,952
DREAMERS, YOU HAVE TO

236
00:07:13,952 --> 00:07:14,352
SEPARATE --

237
00:07:14,352 --> 00:07:17,989
LET ME FINISH.

238
00:07:17,989 --> 00:07:20,658
I THINK ABOUT THE MOTHER WHO

239
00:07:20,658 --> 00:07:22,193
LEFT GUATEMALA OR NICARAGUA OR

240
00:07:22,193 --> 00:07:23,294
EL SALVADOR, THE THREE MOST

241
00:07:23,294 --> 00:07:25,230
DANGEROUS COUNTRIES ON EARTH.

242
00:07:25,230 --> 00:07:26,664
WALKED 3,000 MATH WITH ALL THEIR

243
00:07:26,664 --> 00:07:27,932
BELONGINGS AND THEIR CHILDREN TO

244
00:07:27,932 --> 00:07:29,134
SEEK FREEDOM AND THE AMERICAN

245
00:07:29,134 --> 00:07:30,802
DREAM.

246
00:07:30,802 --> 00:07:32,037
THEY ARE NOWHERE NEAR WHAT MS-13

247
00:07:32,037 --> 00:07:32,303
IS.

248
00:07:32,303 --> 00:07:34,339
>> Greg: IT IS WHAT THEY ARE

249
00:07:34,339 --> 00:07:35,640
REFERRING TO.

250
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:37,709
>> Richard: YOU CANNOT

251
00:07:37,709 --> 00:07:39,210
CONFLATE.

252
00:07:39,210 --> 00:07:41,479
>> Pete: SHE PURPOSELY

253
00:07:41,479 --> 00:07:41,846
CONFLATED.

254
00:07:41,846 --> 00:07:46,951
WHEN TRUMP SAID MS-13       MS 1

255
00:07:46,951 --> 00:07:46,985
WHEN TRUMP SAID MS-13       MS

256
00:07:46,985 --> 00:07:47,018
WHEN TRUMP SAID MS-13       MS H

257
00:07:47,018 --> 00:07:47,085
WHEN TRUMP SAID MS-13       MS T

258
00:07:47,085 --> 00:07:47,118
WHEN TRUMP SAID MS-13       MS E

259
00:07:47,118 --> 00:07:47,352
WHEN TRUMP SAID MS-13       MS Y

260
00:07:47,352 --> 00:07:51,823
ARE ANIMALS, --

261
00:07:51,823 --> 00:07:52,557
THEY WANT TO MAKE PEOPLE THINK

262
00:07:52,557 --> 00:07:54,626
HE IS RACIST.

263
00:07:54,626 --> 00:07:56,428
>> Richard: YOU JUST TWISTED A

264
00:07:56,428 --> 00:07:57,162
WHOLE BUNCH OF THINGS TO CREATE

265
00:07:57,162 --> 00:07:59,831
ALTERNATIVE FACTS.

266
00:07:59,831 --> 00:08:02,233
>> Kimberly: NO, YOU DIDN'T.

267
00:08:02,233 --> 00:08:03,234
>> Richard: WHAT NANCY PELOSI

268
00:08:03,234 --> 00:08:04,569
WAS TRYING TO SAY WAS THE

269
00:08:04,569 --> 00:08:12,644
PREDATOR RHETORIC OVERALL.

270
00:08:12,644 --> 00:08:13,578
THE RHETORIC LEADS TO THE

271
00:08:13,578 --> 00:08:14,813
PROBLEM.

272
00:08:14,813 --> 00:08:16,514
>> Greg: THE ARGUMENT YOU ARE

273
00:08:16,514 --> 00:08:17,715
USING IS THAT IT REALLY DOESN'T

274
00:08:17,715 --> 00:08:19,651
MATTER WHAT TRUMP SAID NOW.

275
00:08:19,651 --> 00:08:23,421
IT'S WHAT HE SAID THEN.

276
00:08:23,421 --> 00:08:25,590
LAND ALSO ONE COULD ARGUE WHAT

277
00:08:25,590 --> 00:08:26,758
HE MEANT BACK THEN WAS EXACTLY

278
00:08:26,758 --> 00:08:28,927
WHAT HE MEANT NOW BUT HE DID IT

279
00:08:28,927 --> 00:08:30,395
IN A SLOPPY WAY.

280
00:08:30,395 --> 00:08:32,630
THE FACT IS THIS ARGUMENT CANNOT

281
00:08:32,630 --> 00:08:33,631
WORK.

282
00:08:33,631 --> 00:08:36,101
I DIDN'T ROB A BANK BUT MAY BE

283
00:08:36,101 --> 00:08:37,501
IN THE PAST I MIGHT HAVE, SO

284
00:08:37,501 --> 00:08:38,602
HE'S PROBABLY GUILTY.

285
00:08:38,602 --> 00:08:41,239
IF HE'S NOT GUILTY NOW, HE WAS

286
00:08:41,239 --> 00:08:42,440
PROBABLY GUILTY THEN.

287
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:43,207
IT'S AN ILLOGICAL ARGUMENT.

288
00:08:43,207 --> 00:08:45,310
YOU CAN'T SAY, AND I USE THIS

289
00:08:45,310 --> 00:08:47,612
ANALOGY BEFORE.

290
00:08:47,612 --> 00:08:48,613
WHEN YOU FIND A HATE CRIME AND

291
00:08:48,613 --> 00:08:50,215
IT TURNS OUT TO BE FALSE, THE

292
00:08:50,215 --> 00:08:52,917
LEFT SAYS WELL, IT'S FALSE HERE

293
00:08:52,917 --> 00:08:54,652
BUT IT COULD BE TRUE SOMEWHERE

294
00:08:54,652 --> 00:08:54,953
ELSE.

295
00:08:54,953 --> 00:08:59,491
IT'S ACTUALLY A DEFLECTION.

296
00:08:59,491 --> 00:09:02,861
ADMITTING TRUMP WAS RIGHT.

297
00:09:02,861 --> 00:09:06,531
>> Kimberly: YOU HEAR ABOUT

298
00:09:06,531 --> 00:09:07,799
PUBLIC SAFETY AND YOU CARE ABOUT

299
00:09:07,799 --> 00:09:08,900
PEOPLE BEING ABLE TO GO TO WORK

300
00:09:08,900 --> 00:09:10,702
AND TAKE THEIR KIDS TO SCHOOL,

301
00:09:10,702 --> 00:09:13,037
WHY WOULD YOU TAKE THE SIDE OF

302
00:09:13,037 --> 00:09:14,405
PEOPLE COMING IN COMMITTING

303
00:09:14,405 --> 00:09:20,145
HEINOUS CRIMES, MURDERS.

304
00:09:20,145 --> 00:09:23,014
>> Greg: WHY ARE YOU IN MS-13?

305
00:09:23,014 --> 00:09:25,617
>> Richard: I AM NOT.

306
00:09:25,617 --> 00:09:25,984
[LAUGHTER]

307
00:09:25,984 --> 00:09:27,652
>> Greg: WHY ARE YOU DENYING

308
00:09:27,652 --> 00:09:27,952
THIS?

309
00:09:27,952 --> 00:09:32,190
>> Richard: WE CAN ALL AGREE

310
00:09:32,190 --> 00:09:34,626
THAT HE IS TAKING NANCY PELOSI

311
00:09:34,626 --> 00:09:35,093
OUT OF CONTEXT.

312
00:09:35,093 --> 00:09:36,628
>> Greg: NO.

313
00:09:36,628 --> 00:09:39,297
SHE TOOK HIM OUT OF CONTEXT, AND

314
00:09:39,297 --> 00:09:40,064
HE RESPONDED.

315
00:09:40,064 --> 00:09:41,566
>> Richard: BY TAKING HER OUT

316
00:09:41,566 --> 00:09:44,369
OF CONTEXT.

317
00:09:44,502 --> 00:09:45,370
PLAYED THIS INCORRECTLY FROM A

318
00:09:45,370 --> 00:09:48,006
STRATEGIC STANDPOINT.

319
00:09:48,006 --> 00:09:50,408
THIS IS A COMMUNITY YOU WOULD

320
00:09:50,408 --> 00:09:51,809
THINK WOULD ACTUALLY LIKE IT IF

321
00:09:51,809 --> 00:09:54,012
THE DEMOCRATS THAT WE UNDERSTAND

322
00:09:54,012 --> 00:09:55,146
YOU ARE NOT LIKE THEM BUT WE ARE

323
00:09:55,146 --> 00:09:57,348
GOING TO PROTECT YOU BY GOING

324
00:09:57,348 --> 00:10:01,286
AFTER THEM.

325
00:10:01,286 --> 00:10:01,986
THE STRATEGY ON THIS DOESN'T

326
00:10:01,986 --> 00:10:04,189
MAKE ANY SENSE.

327
00:10:04,189 --> 00:10:05,390
>> Pete: JUST ADMIT ONE TIME

328
00:10:05,390 --> 00:10:07,926
THE PRESIDENT MIGHT BE RIGHT.

329
00:10:07,926 --> 00:10:12,397
>> Richard: WHEN THE

330
00:10:12,397 --> 00:10:14,032
PRESIDENT'S RIGHT, I WILL GIVE

331
00:10:14,032 --> 00:10:15,033
HIM CREDIT.

332
00:10:15,033 --> 00:10:18,369
BUT HE IS CONFLATING REGULAR

333
00:10:18,369 --> 00:10:18,803
IMMIGRANTS --

334
00:10:18,803 --> 00:10:19,971
>> Kimberly: WE ARE GOING TO

335
00:10:19,971 --> 00:10:23,808
AGREE TO DISAGREE ON THAT.

336
00:10:23,808 --> 00:10:25,009
WATCH THIS HEATED EXCHANGE

337
00:10:25,009 --> 00:10:29,147
BETWEEN THE HEAD OF I.C.E. AND A

338
00:10:29,147 --> 00:10:31,482
DEMOCRATIC CALIFORNIA

339
00:10:31,482 --> 00:10:33,718
CONGRESSWOMAN.

340
00:10:33,718 --> 00:10:34,285
>> WOULD LOVE TO PAINT

341
00:10:34,285 --> 00:10:37,222
IMMIGRANTS AS CRIMINALS.

342
00:10:37,222 --> 00:10:38,223
THAT'S NOT THE COMPLETE FACTS.

343
00:10:38,223 --> 00:10:40,058
IT MAKES ME SICK TO MY STOMACH

344
00:10:40,058 --> 00:10:43,027
TO KEEP HEARING OVER AND OVER

345
00:10:43,027 --> 00:10:44,028
AGAIN, PAINTING THE BROAD STROKE

346
00:10:44,028 --> 00:10:46,030
IN THE PICTURE AS THOUGH THESE

347
00:10:46,030 --> 00:10:47,398
ARE FOLKS WHO ARE COMING HERE TO

348
00:10:47,398 --> 00:10:47,899
DO HARM.

349
00:10:47,899 --> 00:10:50,602
>> NO ONE ON THIS PANEL IS

350
00:10:50,602 --> 00:10:51,636
ANTI-IMMIGRANT.

351
00:10:51,636 --> 00:10:52,604
WE ARE LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS

352
00:10:52,604 --> 00:10:54,339
ENFORCING THE LAW THAT YOU

353
00:10:54,339 --> 00:10:54,672
ENACTED.

354
00:10:54,672 --> 00:10:57,141
TO SAY WE ARE ANTI-IMMIGRANT IS

355
00:10:57,141 --> 00:10:58,409
WRONG.

356
00:10:58,409 --> 00:11:00,144
>> Kimberly: PEOPLE TAKING

357
00:11:00,144 --> 00:11:00,478
OFFENSE.

358
00:11:00,478 --> 00:11:01,746
THEY ARE NOT SAYING THEY ARE

359
00:11:01,746 --> 00:11:02,213
ANTI-IMMIGRANT.

360
00:11:02,213 --> 00:11:04,015
THEY ARE FOR UPHOLDING THE LOST

361
00:11:04,015 --> 00:11:05,617
ARE ON THE BOOKS.

362
00:11:05,617 --> 00:11:07,018
HOW IS IT ANTI-IMMIGRANT?

363
00:11:07,018 --> 00:11:09,120
HOW IS IT RACIST TO ENFORCE THE

364
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:10,421
LAW AND ENSURE PUBLIC SAFETY?

365
00:11:10,421 --> 00:11:12,857
>> Greg: IT IS CONFLATION.

366
00:11:12,857 --> 00:11:15,193
WE HAVE BEEN IN A SITUATION WE

367
00:11:15,193 --> 00:11:15,793
WILL TALK ABOUT ISLAMIC

368
00:11:15,793 --> 00:11:19,797
TERRORISM AND PEOPLE ACCUSE OF

369
00:11:19,797 --> 00:11:20,398
ISLAMAPHOBIA.

370
00:11:20,398 --> 00:11:21,232
I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT ISLAM.

371
00:11:21,232 --> 00:11:24,202
I AM TALKING ABOUT TERRORISTS

372
00:11:24,202 --> 00:11:26,170
WHO HAPPEN TO BE ISLAMIC.

373
00:11:26,170 --> 00:11:26,804
ISLAMIC TERRORISTS.

374
00:11:26,804 --> 00:11:28,806
I DIDN'T SAY ISLAM.
