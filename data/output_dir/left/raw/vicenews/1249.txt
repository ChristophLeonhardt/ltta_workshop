1
00:00:13,300 --> 00:00:14,520
I, Donald Trump, do solemnly swear…

2
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:17,720
We had a wonderful election, didn’t we?

3
00:00:17,900 --> 00:00:20,160
— 3 to 5-million illegal votes.
— We’re waiting to find out!

4
00:00:20,340 --> 00:00:21,840
I inherited a mess.

5
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,280
...repeal and replace…

6
00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:25,460
I could hold off the wall,
but I want to build the wall.

7
00:00:25,460 --> 00:00:26,400
We have to build the wall.

8
00:00:26,580 --> 00:00:27,340
...extreme vetting…

9
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:29,900
...destroying horrible regulations…

10
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:31,600
...maybe I wouldn’t be here,
if it wasn’t for Twitter…

11
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:34,300
I can’t believe I’m saying I’m a politician,
but I guess that’s what I am now.

12
00:00:34,460 --> 00:00:36,880
“Donald Trump wants to get along with Russia!”

13
00:00:37,060 --> 00:00:39,960
...radical Islamic terrorists…!

14
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:41,980
I don’t like to say what I’m doing.

15
00:00:42,140 --> 00:00:43,600
Let’s keep them guessing.

16
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:45,800
...hatred and venom…

17
00:00:45,900 --> 00:00:46,460
...disaster…

18
00:00:46,460 --> 00:00:47,140
...destruction…

19
00:00:47,140 --> 00:00:48,420
...nuclear holocaust…

20
00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:50,200
...the world is in trouble.

21
00:01:10,300 --> 00:01:13,120
— I’m going to this inauguration
to see the transition of power.

22
00:01:13,300 --> 00:01:17,960
— My hope is that he can change
his tone and unite a country.

23
00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:22,280
My fear is that he doesn’t, and
we continue to be a divided country.

24
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:26,500
— This is not the year for us
to sit down and watch.

25
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:30,680
We’re gonna be delegates, we’re going to the
convention, we’re going to the inauguration.

26
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:35,160
— As an American, I’m all for a peaceful transition.

27
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:39,180
But there’s a nice way to do stuff, and
there’s a Donald Trump way to do stuff.

28
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:44,100
— We don’t approve of Trump and
his ways, but, at the same time,

29
00:01:44,100 --> 00:01:45,800
he’s still gonna be President either way.

30
00:01:45,980 --> 00:01:47,000
— Are there concerns?

31
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,860
Yeah, but I’m not gonna be sitting
behind the President scared to death.

32
00:01:50,020 --> 00:01:52,560
— We’re gonna take this thing all the way.

33
00:01:52,740 --> 00:01:55,360
— Trump! Trump! Trump! Trump!

34
00:01:55,540 --> 00:01:57,480
— Love! Not hate!

35
00:01:57,480 --> 00:01:58,920
Makes America great!

36
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:02,400
Love! Not hate! Makes America great!

37
00:02:02,580 --> 00:02:05,660
— The idea for the project came,
I think, from a deep sadness.

38
00:02:05,660 --> 00:02:10,460
I knew at that time that I was gonna
go to the Women’s March in D.C.

39
00:02:10,460 --> 00:02:13,460
I realized that, as an LA girl, I’d be very cold,

40
00:02:13,460 --> 00:02:17,380
and I thought, well, you know, like,
maybe I could knit myself a hat.

41
00:02:17,380 --> 00:02:21,320
I’m such a beginner though, I figured,
if I could knit this hat, anyone could.

42
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:25,740
In that moment, I could just really see
this sea of pink happen,

43
00:02:25,740 --> 00:02:29,450
if it not just, like, a beanie with a
pom-pom, like, a classic hat.

44
00:02:29,450 --> 00:02:31,060
It’s a little different,

45
00:02:31,060 --> 00:02:35,200
and, of course, the wordplay with
“pussy” was, like, too much to ignore.

46
00:02:42,660 --> 00:02:50,060
— And this is protection of the nation from
foreign terrorist entry into the United States.

47
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:53,900
It’s big stuff.

48
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:55,340
— What does that say?

49
00:02:55,340 --> 00:03:00,420
What type of message are we sending
to our allies around the world?

50
00:03:01,900 --> 00:03:04,100
A number of people with valid visas,

51
00:03:04,100 --> 00:03:07,520
they got on the plane before
the executive order was issued,

52
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:09,560
and, when they got off the plane,
they were detained.

53
00:03:09,740 --> 00:03:11,279
— Refugees are welcome here!

54
00:03:11,279 --> 00:03:12,279
No hate!

55
00:03:12,279 --> 00:03:13,279
No fear!

56
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:14,280
Refugees are welcome here…!

57
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:15,440
— I understand one’s been released,

58
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:18,000
but there's still several people that have been detained.

59
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:24,200
— All of these people here are just attesting
to the fact that what they’re doing is not right.

60
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:28,340
— This is un-American, it’s unconstitutional, it’s illegal!

61
00:03:28,340 --> 00:03:30,780
We’ll do this for as long as it takes.

62
00:03:30,780 --> 00:03:32,600
This is our country!

63
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:43,300
— I think we have about 40 to 50
lawyers right now at the airport.

64
00:03:43,300 --> 00:03:46,400
About 25 are inside, and the rest are deployed
at the different terminals

65
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:49,040
that we know there are incoming flights from.

66
00:04:12,860 --> 00:04:15,960
— A federal court in Brooklyn
granted an emergency stay

67
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:20,340
for some affected by President Trump’s
executive orders regarding a refugee ban.

68
00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:32,320
— Thank you very much.

69
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:33,600
— You guys have a good day!

70
00:04:33,740 --> 00:04:35,600
— I love them! I love you!

71
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:55,220
— Jobs and millions of dollars lost because
two power stations are closing down.

72
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:05,320
— Every day I get up around 5 o'clock,
get myself ready for work.

73
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:08,500
I work at the Dayton Power and Light Killen Station.

74
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:12,060
Been there pretty much my whole adult life.

75
00:05:12,060 --> 00:05:15,060
I started up there right after I turned 21-years-old.

76
00:05:15,060 --> 00:05:18,820
The power plant’s pretty much all I know.

77
00:05:18,820 --> 00:05:24,760
I'm 56-years-old, and I'm going to
lose my job here in around 14 months.

78
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:26,920
And I'm not sure what I'm gonna do.

79
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:38,080
It's just so scary to think about
having to go to another job.

80
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:39,740
I mean, whether it's...

81
00:05:39,740 --> 00:05:42,560
No disrespect to McDonald's,
because I’ll work at McDonald's

82
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:44,640
if that’s what it takes to get health insurance.

83
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:47,800
But I don't know how I'll be with the public,

84
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:52,520
after working in such a close setting in a man’s world.

85
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:54,300
It’s gonna be a lot different for me.

86
00:05:54,300 --> 00:06:00,100
It’s just really sad, because I thought
the beginning of my life would be here,

87
00:06:00,100 --> 00:06:03,710
and the end of my work life would be here.

88
00:06:03,710 --> 00:06:06,090
I'm too young to really retire.

89
00:06:06,090 --> 00:06:08,120
I'm not going to have any health insurance,

90
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:11,120
and I don't have anybody to lean on, it's just me.

91
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:15,400
We were told in November, when they
announced that the plant was closing,

92
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:17,600
that Trump couldn't save us.

93
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:19,480
So I don't believe he can.

94
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:22,000
I believe it's too far gone.

95
00:06:24,420 --> 00:06:28,180
— I'm Jamie Dimon I'm the Chairman
and CEO of JPMorgan Chase.

96
00:06:28,180 --> 00:06:31,240
And I was recently named the Chairman
of the Business Roundtable.

97
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:36,520
I've always deeply believed that collaboration
between business, governments, civic society,

98
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:41,090
is the way to come up with the answers and solutions
to the problems that this wonderful country has.

99
00:06:41,090 --> 00:06:45,100
I've only been Chairman for a short period
of time, but this new administration,

100
00:06:45,100 --> 00:06:49,140
not just the President, but all the folks who
I've worked with, have been very responsive.

101
00:06:49,140 --> 00:06:53,140
Of course there's some backlash that I get,
including a little bit from my children,

102
00:06:53,140 --> 00:06:58,120
but... people get this huge confusion that, somehow,
because you're trying to help your government,

103
00:06:58,120 --> 00:07:00,340
you're supporting all of their policies.

104
00:07:00,340 --> 00:07:02,800
I don't think anyone supports all the policies,

105
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:06,320
and the good news for y’all is that the ones
we don't support, we've been pretty vocal about.

106
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:10,980
Having collaboration, working together,
is the way to fix the ills of the country.

107
00:07:10,980 --> 00:07:13,680
I did it for this President.
I did it for President Barack Obama.

108
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:15,700
I’d do it for anyone who’s in that office.

109
00:07:17,540 --> 00:07:21,020
— Our classic Gallup job approval rating is one question:

110
00:07:21,020 --> 00:07:25,300
“Do you approve or disapprove of the way blank,” whoever happens to be President,

111
00:07:25,300 --> 00:07:28,520
“is handling his job as President of the United States?”

112
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:32,040
— We’re just early on into the presidency.

113
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:34,060
And I think we have to give him a chance.

114
00:07:34,060 --> 00:07:39,060
I think it's great that he has chosen to stir things up,

115
00:07:39,060 --> 00:07:40,920
and that we’re not doing things traditionally,

116
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:43,560
because, obviously, traditionally doesn't work.

117
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:45,580
And I think that...

118
00:07:45,580 --> 00:07:48,460
he does some little bit questionable things.

119
00:07:48,460 --> 00:07:52,200
But I think, in the end,
his motives are in the right direction.

120
00:07:59,740 --> 00:08:04,480
— On February 9th, the President swore in
Attorney General Jeff Sessions,

121
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:09,480
then signed four executive orders designed
to look like he was getting tough on crime.

122
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:13,120
One called for the creation of an
anti-drug smuggling task force...

123
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:14,920
...that already exists.

124
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:18,620
Another created a succession plan
if the Attorney General dies...

125
00:08:18,620 --> 00:08:21,700
...and the two people below him also die.

126
00:08:21,700 --> 00:08:23,500
Trump likes executive orders.

127
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:25,960
So far, he's issued 29.

128
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:29,060
A few could have a real impact,
including the travel ban,

129
00:08:29,060 --> 00:08:31,120
despite being blocked in federal court.

130
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:35,659
But for the most part, they're just show business.

131
00:08:35,659 --> 00:08:39,259
Trump has signed orders encouraging
businesses to hire American,

132
00:08:39,260 --> 00:08:41,179
ordering up a report on trade deficits,

133
00:08:41,179 --> 00:08:44,660
and establishing a task force on rural prosperity.

134
00:08:44,660 --> 00:08:46,740
Executive orders can get attention,

135
00:08:46,740 --> 00:08:49,400
but Trump isn't using them to make actual policy.

136
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:52,220
For that, he turns off the cameras and pivots—

137
00:08:52,220 --> 00:08:55,600
to the little-known Congressional Review Act.

138
00:08:55,600 --> 00:09:00,140
The CRA allows Congress to get rid of
government regulations that it doesn't like,

139
00:09:00,140 --> 00:09:03,620
provided that it acts within 60 legislative days.

140
00:09:03,620 --> 00:09:06,100
Because the Trump presidency is still so young,

141
00:09:06,100 --> 00:09:09,700
the CRA’s time window reaches
back into the last administration,

142
00:09:09,700 --> 00:09:13,840
letting Trump and Congress
erase Obama-era regulations.

143
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:14,720
The catch?

144
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:19,280
Once rules are overturned by the CRA,
they can't be easily reinstated.

145
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:22,560
One CRA vote deleted a rule requiring oil companies

146
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:25,660
to report when they make payments
to foreign governments.

147
00:09:25,660 --> 00:09:30,600
Another CRA broadened states’ ability
to impose drug tests on the unemployed,

148
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:34,440
by striking a rule that state
unemployment compensation agencies

149
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:38,340
can only drug test people whose jobs
normally require drug testing,

150
00:09:38,340 --> 00:09:41,860
like flight attendants or armed security guards.

151
00:09:41,860 --> 00:09:46,700
Other CRAs have eliminated a prohibition
on coal companies dumping into streams,

152
00:09:46,700 --> 00:09:51,660
a directive requiring companies who drill on
public land to contain their carbon emissions,

153
00:09:51,660 --> 00:09:55,920
and a regulation that asks government
contractors bidding on new contracts

154
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:58,840
to disclose any recent violation of law.

155
00:09:58,840 --> 00:10:04,300
Until this year, the CRA had only been
used once since its creation in 1996.

156
00:10:04,300 --> 00:10:06,880
Trump has used the law 13 times.

157
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:10,400
He can continue to target Obama rules until early May.

158
00:10:19,140 --> 00:10:20,360
— My name is Andy Puzder.

159
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:25,480
I was Donald Trump's first nominee for
the position of Secretary of Labor.

160
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:31,300
When I got the phone call, I was at a hotel in
Washington, D.C. getting ready for my hearing.

161
00:10:31,300 --> 00:10:36,540
The first phone call was a discussion about
the fact that the leader didn't think he had the votes,

162
00:10:36,540 --> 00:10:40,900
and that, despite my aspirations
and desires and my willingness,

163
00:10:40,900 --> 00:10:43,920
I was not going to be the next Secretary of Labor.

164
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:45,700
I was disappointed.

165
00:10:45,700 --> 00:10:48,920
I really felt that, you know, somebody
who started out scooping ice cream,

166
00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:53,560
and cutting lawns, and painting houses, and
busting up concrete with the jackhammer,

167
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:55,940
playing in bands, working in a music store,

168
00:10:55,940 --> 00:11:00,840
and ended up being a successful
CEO of a major company,

169
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:03,260
I really felt that, my whole professional career,

170
00:11:03,260 --> 00:11:06,100
I'd been training for the position of Secretary of Labor.

171
00:11:06,100 --> 00:11:08,860
I didn't learn much about government,
I learned a lot about politics.

172
00:11:08,860 --> 00:11:14,840
I learned that, even to the extent that
you think that the truth is going to matter more

173
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:16,900
than the narrative that the other side can create,

174
00:11:16,900 --> 00:11:18,980
you're probably deceiving yourself.

175
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:30,580
— I'm Roger Stone,

176
00:11:30,580 --> 00:11:34,440
New York Times bestselling author and pundit.

177
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:42,780
I've been a political activist and a Republican
political consultant for almost 40 years.

178
00:11:42,790 --> 00:11:46,820
I think I may be under surveillance from the NSA,

179
00:11:46,820 --> 00:11:49,700
actually, the FBI, at the direction of the NSA,

180
00:11:49,700 --> 00:11:54,300
based on this false charge that
I have somehow colluded with the Russians

181
00:11:54,300 --> 00:11:56,960
to aid the election of Donald Trump.

182
00:11:58,120 --> 00:12:04,260
"The Smoking Gun" fake news site published
the fact that I had a direct message exchange

183
00:12:04,260 --> 00:12:10,580
with Guccifer 2.0, the hacker
who we believe was responsible

184
00:12:10,580 --> 00:12:16,260
for the original hack of the DNC document.

185
00:12:16,260 --> 00:12:25,900
I'm happy to show you the direct message
exchanges between Guccifer 2.0 and myself today.

186
00:12:25,900 --> 00:12:31,360
That is the full and total exchange
between Guccifer 2.0,

187
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:33,320
who is not a Russian hacker,

188
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:36,880
and me, on August 14th.

189
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:41,680
I come in on his being reinstated to Twitter.

190
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:43,280
I send him a retweet.

191
00:12:43,280 --> 00:12:46,660
He says I'm a great man,
offers to help me in any way he can—

192
00:12:46,660 --> 00:12:48,460
I did not respond to that.

193
00:12:48,460 --> 00:12:52,960
He sends me the link to a public website

194
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:56,250
that has a turnout model for the Democrats
in the presidential campaign.

195
00:12:56,250 --> 00:13:01,820
And no, I did not pass it onto the
Trump campaign or anyone else.

196
00:13:01,820 --> 00:13:02,720
That's it.

197
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:07,660
Certainly doesn't constitute treason or collusion.

198
00:13:07,660 --> 00:13:12,220
No one in their right mind would be
involved in espionage on Twitter.

199
00:13:12,220 --> 00:13:13,560
It's innocuous.

200
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:14,440
It's boring.

201
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:15,640
It’s banal.

202
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:16,640
It’s insignificant.

203
00:13:22,060 --> 00:13:23,700
Yes, I landed at Houston.

204
00:13:23,700 --> 00:13:26,020
It was about 2 p.m.

205
00:13:26,020 --> 00:13:30,220
I was interrogated by a young officer, actually.

206
00:13:30,230 --> 00:13:35,260
He asked me a lot of things
about my parents, about my family.

207
00:13:35,260 --> 00:13:40,760
He told me that I wasn't allowed to give
a lecture, and be paid for this lecture.

208
00:13:40,760 --> 00:13:43,920
He said, “You will be deported by the next plane.”

209
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:49,160
As a whole, I spent about 10 hours
in this room for people being checked,

210
00:13:49,160 --> 00:13:50,780
so-called “vetting,”

211
00:13:50,780 --> 00:13:57,320
and, finally, I was released because of an
intervention of a lawyer from the university.

212
00:13:57,320 --> 00:14:02,980
The officer who released me was a more
experienced officer than the previous one.

213
00:14:02,980 --> 00:14:07,700
And he said to me, “You know, the guy who
interrogated you was absolutely inexperienced."

214
00:14:07,700 --> 00:14:15,140
"He didn't know that there was an exception for
people giving lectures with a normal tourist visa.”

215
00:14:15,140 --> 00:14:18,820
What was really disturbing to me, this officer told me,

216
00:14:18,820 --> 00:14:22,720
“The next time you come to the U.S.,
you will have your passport, of course,"

217
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:25,560
"you will have a letter of invitation by university,"

218
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:32,940
"but bring with you the excerpt of the
U.S. immigration law to show to the officer.”

219
00:14:32,940 --> 00:14:40,020
So I said, “So, I have to show a U.S. Immigration Officer
what is the U.S. law? This is absolutely unbelievable.”

220
00:14:43,300 --> 00:14:45,680
— For the longest time under Obama,

221
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:49,100
I felt like the whole country has
told me how to think, how to act—

222
00:14:49,100 --> 00:14:52,520
just trying to tell me everything I thought was wrong.

223
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:57,820
Being pro-life, pro-weed, pro-Jesus, was all wrong.

224
00:14:57,820 --> 00:15:01,280
And he gave America balls,

225
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:05,500
he gave me the authorization to be who I really am.

226
00:15:12,540 --> 00:15:16,200
— I signed a letter, along with other law enforcement
leaders across the country,

227
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:20,470
concerned about the Trump administration's
stance on immigration.

228
00:15:20,470 --> 00:15:26,220
I'm being forced to, or they're trying to force me,
to do something that I can't do legally.

229
00:15:26,220 --> 00:15:30,560
that I don't have the resources to do,
and that I'm philosophically opposed to.

230
00:15:31,820 --> 00:15:34,480
— I don't know who Carter Page is,
I never had a conversation with Carter Page…

231
00:15:34,660 --> 00:15:37,020
— ...and, the other one, Carter Page,
I don’t even know who that is…

232
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:39,380
— Carter Page—mysterious figure
within the Trump orbit, who…

233
00:15:39,540 --> 00:15:41,460
— You're not a Russian agent.

234
00:15:41,620 --> 00:15:42,780
— Obviously not.

235
00:15:42,780 --> 00:15:46,520
It's so false, that it's hard to know where to even begin.

236
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:49,960
— What was your role in the Trump campaign exactly?

237
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:53,660
— I was a member of a... committee.

238
00:15:53,660 --> 00:16:01,360
It was a team that was named
back in March, and I provided, uh...

239
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:03,280
We got together and had some meetings.

240
00:16:03,280 --> 00:16:05,580
I didn't have any major role to begin with,

241
00:16:05,580 --> 00:16:09,020
so I think this is something that was used against me,

242
00:16:09,020 --> 00:16:14,800
where they just wanted to attack
then-candidate Trump.

243
00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:16,000
— What did that consist of?

244
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:19,680
Did you write briefing papers,
did you ever actually brief Trump?

245
00:16:19,840 --> 00:16:21,540
— I never actually briefed him.

246
00:16:21,540 --> 00:16:26,880
And, in retrospect, I'm glad I never did.

247
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:31,260
— Do you think that Russia interfered
in the U.S. election?

248
00:16:31,420 --> 00:16:38,360
— I have been so focused on the interference
that was done by, first, the Clinton campaign,

249
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:46,780
but also, now we know, with the FISA warrant,
with the support of the Obama administration.

250
00:16:46,780 --> 00:16:50,080
That, to me, had a much bigger impact.

251
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:54,540
— But surely you wouldn't be approving
of any foreign government

252
00:16:54,540 --> 00:16:57,080
trying to interfere with the
American electoral process.

253
00:16:57,240 --> 00:16:58,360
— Of course not.

254
00:16:58,540 --> 00:16:59,700
— I mean, including Russia.

255
00:16:59,860 --> 00:17:01,880
— Yeah, definitely not.

256
00:17:02,060 --> 00:17:05,900
— Do you think that Russia is a purely benign actor?

257
00:17:06,060 --> 00:17:07,420
— No one is perfect.

258
00:17:07,420 --> 00:17:12,240
No human on this planet and
no country on this planet is perfect.

259
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:17,940
One of the biggest misunderstandings is,
a lot of steps that they take sometimes,

260
00:17:17,940 --> 00:17:20,500
frankly, antagonistic steps.

261
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:24,620
It's largely a reaction to steps
that have been taken on our side.

262
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:29,400
— Do you think you became a little bit of, like,
an evangelist for this idea over the years?

263
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:33,320
— That people should look again at Russia?

264
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:41,820
Frankly speaking, given the fact that there's so
few people providing this alternative perspective,

265
00:17:41,820 --> 00:17:49,120
sometimes I actually admittedly, perhaps,
overcompensate a little bit by trying to factor that in.

266
00:17:49,300 --> 00:17:51,740
— Is there something that you're starting
to think now—like, “Oh, okay…”

267
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:54,700
— Well, certainly, I've paid a price for that.

268
00:17:54,860 --> 00:17:59,400
— How do you feel Trump's done in the
first 100 days with the U.S.-Russia relationship?

269
00:17:59,560 --> 00:18:06,500
— I think he has had monumental challenges, and
I was always so impressed during the campaign,

270
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:11,580
where people created these major obstacles,

271
00:18:11,580 --> 00:18:14,980
in almost all instances, based on complete lies,

272
00:18:14,980 --> 00:18:20,040
about his views on Russia,
and how nefarious and terrible that is.

273
00:18:20,040 --> 00:18:28,400
And yet, time after time, he had the political courage
and the moral courage to stand up and do what's right.

274
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:41,640
— Since the beginning of this administration,

275
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:47,020
we've witnessed a 50% increase
in people asking for help or assistance.

276
00:18:47,020 --> 00:18:53,800
Everyday, we have attorneys that are here
in our offices, providing free consultations.

277
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:28,340
— My name is John Dean.

278
00:19:28,340 --> 00:19:36,220
I was Richard Nixon's White House Counsel
when the arrests at the Watergate occurred.

279
00:19:36,220 --> 00:19:39,760
I find it pretty amazing that President Trump claims

280
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:43,860
that his predecessor, President Obama, wiretapped him.

281
00:19:43,860 --> 00:19:49,260
First of all, the procedures to do that are
so difficult today, unlike during Nixon's time,

282
00:19:49,260 --> 00:19:55,600
but the fact that Trump would claim that Obama
would use official government channels to do it,

283
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:59,920
and think that couldn't be resolved
almost instantly, is absurd.

284
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:03,680
And it has been resolved,
and it was an absurd charge.

285
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:08,540
It was, in fact, just a defamation by
one President against his predecessor.

286
00:20:08,540 --> 00:20:12,320
Nixon and Trump are two very different men

287
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:14,340
with a lot of similarities.

288
00:20:14,340 --> 00:20:18,600
Nixon is a little bit more...
probably sneakier than Trump.

289
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:22,020
But Trump, I think, is going to be
right up-front about what he's doing.

290
00:20:22,020 --> 00:20:26,040
But their mean streaks and their
revenge streaks are pretty visible.

291
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:26,200
Immigration pulled me aside and asked me
if they could ask me a couple of questions.

292
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:28,220
I said, “Okay, sure.”

293
00:21:28,220 --> 00:21:32,040
“What’s your name?” And I said, “Muhammad Ali, Jr.”

294
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:34,980
And then they asked me,
“Who gave you your name?”

295
00:21:34,980 --> 00:21:37,540
I said, “My mother and my father, duh.”

296
00:21:37,540 --> 00:21:41,440
And so, they asked me what was my religion.

297
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:44,940
And I was like, “I’m a Muslim, but what
does that have to do with my travel?”

298
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:48,900
— In the meantime, they rolled me into another room,

299
00:21:48,900 --> 00:21:51,040
and the first thing they asked me was,

300
00:21:51,050 --> 00:21:54,030
“What is your religion?”

301
00:21:54,030 --> 00:21:56,493
I just happened to have pictures with me,
to sign autographs,

302
00:21:56,500 --> 00:22:00,180
and they said, “Oh! You’re Muhammad Ali’s wife!

303
00:22:00,180 --> 00:22:02,960
"Oh, okay! Okay, you’re free to go.”

304
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:04,760
And I said, “Well, where’s my son?”

305
00:22:04,940 --> 00:22:07,380
And then, after that was up,
about four or five minutes,

306
00:22:07,380 --> 00:22:09,680
they told me I was free to go.

307
00:22:09,690 --> 00:22:11,900
We were invited to Washington, to Capitol Hill,

308
00:22:11,900 --> 00:22:14,040
to speak about this whole incident.

309
00:22:14,040 --> 00:22:18,160
They took me into a room,
and asked me the questions again.

310
00:22:20,420 --> 00:22:24,260
I presented my ID, he said,
“Oh, I’ve gotta call somebody.”

311
00:22:24,260 --> 00:22:25,640
We were like, “Who do you have to call?”

312
00:22:25,800 --> 00:22:26,780
— Homeland Security.

313
00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:29,440
— He said, “They’re checking something, I dunno.”

314
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:32,520
And then they said my ID was not valid.

315
00:22:32,520 --> 00:22:34,920
So that’s when I presented my passport.

316
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:38,420
But if I didn’t have a passport, I wouldn’t
have gotten back to Fort Lauderdale.

317
00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:44,280
— This is total harassment, total discrimination,
totally out of line and totally unacceptable.

318
00:22:44,440 --> 00:22:48,120
— And totally unconstitutional.

319
00:22:48,300 --> 00:22:48,800
— Yes.

320
00:22:53,140 --> 00:22:55,360
— I had been in Florida for a couple of days,

321
00:22:55,360 --> 00:23:00,240
and I’d gotten on my plane to come back
from Florida at 2 o’clock on that Friday.

322
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:03,000
And when I landed at 5 o’clock,

323
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:08,240
I saw a series of text messages and emails from
friends of mine from all across the country,

324
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:11,840
asking me things like, “Are you okay?” and “Is it true?”

325
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:15,220
It’s not remarkable at all for a
new President of another party

326
00:23:15,220 --> 00:23:18,640
to ask the United States attorneys and
other political appointees to resign.

327
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:25,650
What was completely unprecedented was the idea
that 46 of us would be asked to leave by midnight.

328
00:23:25,650 --> 00:23:28,520
So for me, effectively, it was seven hours’ notice.

329
00:23:28,520 --> 00:23:34,280
What saddens me is, I think it just
reflects a lack of appreciation,

330
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:36,920
and I don’t mean in the “clap clap” sense—“yay.”

331
00:23:36,920 --> 00:23:43,370
But I mean a lack of fundamental understanding
of the profound work that U.S. attorneys do

332
00:23:43,370 --> 00:23:47,080
in their communities completely apolitically.

333
00:23:48,460 --> 00:23:51,460
— But you know what, you’re asking me
a question, and I’m gonna answer it,

334
00:23:51,460 --> 00:23:52,320
which is, the President—

335
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:55,980
I’m sorry, please stop shaking your head again...

336
00:23:57,180 --> 00:24:00,060
— I am Mike McCurry, the former
White House Press Secretary

337
00:24:00,060 --> 00:24:04,549
to President Bill Clinton from 1995 to 1998.

338
00:24:04,549 --> 00:24:11,080
I think, sometimes, the press corps doesn’t have a lot
of sympathy for the role of the Press Secretary.

339
00:24:11,080 --> 00:24:14,820
Senior staff wants you, sometimes,
to be out there and

340
00:24:14,820 --> 00:24:18,940
be much more aggressive in dealing with
hostile questions from the press corps.

341
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:23,200
— I know the pool needs to get to
the vans, for the signing.

342
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:24,860
Thank you, I’ll be back tomorrow—

343
00:24:24,860 --> 00:24:26,920
We’re going to be five days in a row
this week, ladies and gentlemen.

344
00:24:27,100 --> 00:24:30,320
— But at the end of the day, you have
to maintain your own credibility

345
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:34,220
and make sure that the press corps sees you
as someone who shoots straight.

346
00:24:34,220 --> 00:24:37,240
It’s actually what the American public needs.

347
00:24:39,980 --> 00:24:44,120
— ISIS is making a tremendous amount of money
because they have certain oil camps, right?

348
00:24:44,120 --> 00:24:46,340
They have certain areas of oil that they took away.

349
00:24:46,360 --> 00:24:49,020
I would bomb the shit out of ‘em.

350
00:26:01,740 --> 00:26:03,100
—  Are you feeling better now?

351
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:22,300
— The battle in western Mosul has been
a more complex fight than in the East.

352
00:26:22,300 --> 00:26:28,220
The neighborhoods here are older, the streets
smaller, and ISIS is more heavily dug-in.

353
00:26:28,220 --> 00:26:33,560
But under the Trump administration, the U.S.-led
coalition has increased bombing in Iraq and Syria

354
00:26:33,560 --> 00:26:37,919
to an all-time high,
since Operation Inherent Resolve began.

355
00:26:37,920 --> 00:26:43,820
The site of the airstrike has been sealed
off to media, and an investigation is ongoing.

356
00:26:43,820 --> 00:26:48,960
We tried to get as close as we could,
but the area is still an active fight zone.

357
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:55,440
— What’s that sound that we hear now?

358
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:00,640
— American?
— American.

359
00:27:01,220 --> 00:27:04,980
— In a Skype interview,
the chief American spokesperson in Baghdad

360
00:27:04,980 --> 00:27:07,880
told us there had been a loosening
of the rules of engagement,

361
00:27:07,880 --> 00:27:10,160
starting at the beginning of the year.

362
00:27:10,300 --> 00:27:17,300
— The change was that, if we have eyes on
the target, with our forces on the ground,

363
00:27:17,300 --> 00:27:21,760
the commander who is on the ground
with those eyes on the target

364
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:25,140
can call in the airstrike without
going through a strike cell.

365
00:27:26,280 --> 00:27:31,560
— The spokesperson insisted they’re still doing
everything they can to avoid civilian casualties.

366
00:27:31,560 --> 00:27:35,620
But this change in policy is part of
the investigation into what went wrong.

367
00:27:35,620 --> 00:27:38,680
Right now, the details are still sketchy.

368
00:27:38,680 --> 00:27:42,440
Even the number of air strikes that took place isn’t clear.

369
00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:43,700
— So that’s your street?

370
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:56,540
— Miassar Hamdi says an airstrike hit his home
the morning after the March 17th attack.

371
00:28:01,700 --> 00:28:05,060
— And his daughter’s foot was partially severed.

372
00:28:05,060 --> 00:28:08,440
Some people say that this new
American President, Donald Trump,

373
00:28:08,440 --> 00:28:14,000
is following more aggressive strategy
with these types of airstrikes.

374
00:28:40,520 --> 00:28:42,840
— So far I approve of what he’s done,

375
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:45,560
I feel like he is keeping a lot of his promises

376
00:28:45,560 --> 00:28:49,830
that he had mentioned during the campaign.

377
00:28:49,830 --> 00:28:54,780
I really personally appreciate the executive order to...

378
00:28:54,780 --> 00:28:59,720
it’s not a full repeal, but starting
to work with the Affordable Care Act,

379
00:28:59,720 --> 00:29:02,320
and making it so that me, as an American citizen,

380
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:05,280
can make my own choice about healthcare.

381
00:29:08,300 --> 00:29:09,940
— We were very close.

382
00:29:09,940 --> 00:29:12,400
It was a very, very tight margin.

383
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:15,080
With no Democrat support, we couldn’t quite get there,

384
00:29:15,080 --> 00:29:18,820
we were just a very small number of votes short.

385
00:29:18,980 --> 00:29:21,780
— Everybody remembers the first 24 hours. You do.

386
00:29:21,780 --> 00:29:24,860
I went to pottery class, a ceramics class.

387
00:29:24,860 --> 00:29:28,780
I remember sitting there,
being like, “Fuck…” you know?

388
00:29:28,780 --> 00:29:30,860
Like, you just remember, everything’s, like, in slow-mo.

389
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:33,200
— What kind of cancer do you have? 
Like, what’s the specifics of yours?

390
00:29:33,340 --> 00:29:35,260
— Intraductal carcinoma.

391
00:29:35,280 --> 00:29:36,920
Well, I was stage one when I was diagnosed.

392
00:29:36,920 --> 00:29:40,140
And now, I’m stage three, because it spread.

393
00:29:40,300 --> 00:29:41,480
— Oh, so it spread since then.

394
00:29:41,660 --> 00:29:42,760
— It went into my lymph nodes.

395
00:29:42,940 --> 00:29:46,080
— So you’re a person who actually buys your
healthcare through the Obamacare exchange?

396
00:29:46,280 --> 00:29:46,880
— Yeah.

397
00:29:47,040 --> 00:29:48,840
— Because you and your partner
are small business, right?

398
00:29:49,020 --> 00:29:50,660
— Yes.

399
00:29:50,660 --> 00:29:51,980
We say you should know your fisherman.

400
00:29:51,990 --> 00:29:53,120
Just like you should know your farmer,

401
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:54,760
you should know where your food comes from.

402
00:29:54,760 --> 00:29:57,740
We want people to understand that
salmon are a really special thing,

403
00:29:57,740 --> 00:30:00,940
it’s not something to take for granted.

404
00:30:01,100 --> 00:30:04,400
— I know that Alaska is a crazy place to get insurance,

405
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:06,840
so what’s that process been like for Obamacare?

406
00:30:07,040 --> 00:30:10,360
— I had to choose between two
insurance plans at that time.

407
00:30:10,360 --> 00:30:13,600
And it’s since gone down to one
insurance plan on the Alaska market.

408
00:30:13,780 --> 00:30:15,480
— I’m on an island with you.

409
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:19,200
There are 3,000 people who live here,
there’s no roads in and out.

410
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:23,720
But you have a little hospital, so how does
that work for you in terms of healthcare?

411
00:30:23,880 --> 00:30:26,820
— Well, it means we have to leave to do big stuff.

412
00:30:26,820 --> 00:30:30,160
There’s no oncologist, there’s no cancer doctors.

413
00:30:30,160 --> 00:30:33,760
This fall, I had surgery down in Seattle.

414
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:36,680
And then, we came back here.

415
00:30:36,680 --> 00:30:42,420
And that’s when we realized that Moda was not
going to cover our facility here as in-network.

416
00:30:42,420 --> 00:30:45,620
And so, we’re realizing that, to do chemo,

417
00:30:45,620 --> 00:30:49,600
the cost for us was going to be significantly
less if we went down to Oregon,

418
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:53,820
where my parents live, and I’ve a lot of friends
and family that can help take care of us.

419
00:30:53,980 --> 00:30:55,640
— You had two insurance options, then?

420
00:30:55,800 --> 00:30:57,340
— We had two insurance options at that point.

421
00:30:57,520 --> 00:31:04,260
— And the one you had chosen didn’t cover the hospital
in your hometown for a chemo, specifically.

422
00:31:04,420 --> 00:31:05,380
— For anything.

423
00:31:05,540 --> 00:31:08,480
— Okay, and you didn’t know that
when you picked it, I guess.

424
00:31:08,680 --> 00:31:14,040
— Call me crazy, I just made the assumption that
one of the two insurers in Alaska would cover…

425
00:31:14,040 --> 00:31:14,800
...Alaska.

426
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:19,920
— You had to move to Oregon to get your chemo done,
until you could change insurance companies?

427
00:31:20,120 --> 00:31:21,080
— Exactly, yeah.

428
00:31:21,080 --> 00:31:25,580
Once I was able to switch from Moda
to Premera, it became in-network.

429
00:31:25,720 --> 00:31:27,420
— Okay, so then you were able to come back here?

430
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:29,620
— Yeah.

431
00:31:29,620 --> 00:31:32,380
We face a lot of uncertainty, right?

432
00:31:32,380 --> 00:31:35,400
Like it could go well, it could go bad.
It’s always changing.

433
00:31:35,400 --> 00:31:37,180
The rates go up every year.

434
00:31:37,180 --> 00:31:39,360
Now, we’re in this sort-of
hostile regulatory environment,

435
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:44,940
where the administration and the party that has power
doesn’t like the current healthcare system.

436
00:31:44,940 --> 00:31:51,900
I think there’s a disconnect between this,
“We’re Republicans, we’re pro-business,”

437
00:31:51,900 --> 00:31:57,440
but what they mean is “We’re pro-big insurance
companies making big bonuses for their CEOs.”

438
00:31:57,440 --> 00:31:59,500
They’re not talking about businesses like ours.

439
00:31:59,660 --> 00:32:03,020
— I’m talking to you of course, now,
after Trump is President,

440
00:32:03,020 --> 00:32:06,360
and it does feel like things are a little bit different
and a little bit more uncertain with healthcare,

441
00:32:06,360 --> 00:32:12,340
but, before that time, would you have called 
yourself a satisfied Obamacare customer?

442
00:32:12,500 --> 00:32:13,440
— No.

443
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:17,060
We kinda fell out the frying pan into the fire.

444
00:32:17,060 --> 00:32:19,820
I mean, before that, I was complaining
about Obamacare all the time.

445
00:32:19,820 --> 00:32:24,000
It’s not a solution for the long-term,
it doesn’t work for a lot of people,

446
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:25,240
it doesn’t work for middle class people,

447
00:32:25,240 --> 00:32:27,500
working class people who actually work,

448
00:32:27,500 --> 00:32:30,200
and then are, like, hampered by these big premiums.

449
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:31,620
Makes it hard to run a business.

450
00:32:31,780 --> 00:32:33,940
— You don’t want to see it repealed and replaced?

451
00:32:34,120 --> 00:32:37,520
— I want to see it repealed and
replaced with single-payer.

452
00:32:37,520 --> 00:32:41,520
This is, like, the great “emperor wears
no clothes” in American healthcare,

453
00:32:41,520 --> 00:32:44,300
because everyone’s like
“Sweet, let’s just expand Medicare.”

454
00:32:44,300 --> 00:32:45,880
And the Democrats and the Republicans are like,

455
00:32:45,880 --> 00:32:49,340
“No! We have to make it work for the insurance
companies! No! The government can’t be involved!”

456
00:32:49,340 --> 00:32:51,100
That’s all, like, horseshit.

457
00:32:51,280 --> 00:32:54,800
— How did it feel for you,
when that health care bill failed?

458
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:56,460
— Relief.

459
00:32:56,460 --> 00:32:58,560
Well, for us it was just like a very tangible relief.

460
00:32:58,560 --> 00:32:59,799
Sweet, you know?

461
00:32:59,799 --> 00:33:04,460
We can continue to get along and invest in
our business and be self-reliant as a family

462
00:33:04,460 --> 00:33:09,800
and not have to do a GoFundMe just to pay
for Malena’s deductibles and all that.

463
00:33:17,720 --> 00:33:19,340
— I'm Kyle Beaman.

464
00:33:19,340 --> 00:33:23,010
I work at Rexnord Bearings in Indianapolis, Indiana.

465
00:33:23,010 --> 00:33:24,880
I'm a quality control inspector.

466
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:28,840
I've been there just short of 10 years.

467
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:32,060
They announced that they were
shutting down the facility.

468
00:33:32,060 --> 00:33:37,640
They're going to move it to Monterrey, Mexico,
and also to McAllen, Texas.

469
00:33:37,640 --> 00:33:40,460
The real bad part was, was when they told us

470
00:33:40,460 --> 00:33:44,670
we were going to have to train
our counterparts for that job.

471
00:33:44,670 --> 00:33:48,520
I'm sorry, you should’ve had a better contingency plan

472
00:33:48,520 --> 00:33:52,299
when you thought that you were going to
move this plant just lickety-split to Mexico.

473
00:33:52,299 --> 00:33:54,150
I'm not mad at the Mexican people.

474
00:33:54,150 --> 00:33:56,760
I'm mad at Rexnord corporation.

475
00:33:56,760 --> 00:34:00,180
If I was to speak to Donald Trump,
President of the United States,

476
00:34:00,180 --> 00:34:04,650
I would say, “I'm happy you were elected."

477
00:34:04,650 --> 00:34:09,719
I'm happy that you are able to help Carrier,
I wish you could’ve done more for my company.

478
00:34:09,719 --> 00:34:12,859
If you can’t help us, help somebody else,

479
00:34:12,860 --> 00:34:15,620
because you said you were going
to bring jobs back to America,

480
00:34:15,620 --> 00:34:17,600
and I'm going to hold you to it.

481
00:35:11,960 --> 00:35:16,700
— Tonight, I ordered a targeted military strike

482
00:35:16,700 --> 00:35:24,840
on the airfield in Syria, from where
the chemical attack was launched.

483
00:35:27,560 --> 00:35:32,760
— He’s maybe, I think, gone a little too far
in some of the things that he has done,

484
00:35:32,760 --> 00:35:36,240
specifically the airstrikes in Syria.

485
00:35:36,240 --> 00:35:41,600
So I’m kind-of on the fence
right now with where he's at.

486
00:36:29,900 --> 00:36:33,000
— Has this place always looked like this...?

487
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:34,460
— No. God, no.

488
00:36:34,460 --> 00:36:41,020
In the heyday of that mill, 10, 15 years ago,
this place would be wall-to-wall.

489
00:36:41,020 --> 00:36:43,800
You come in here on a payday,
and they’d be three-deep at the bar.

490
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:45,500
I mean, it used to be a mill bar.

491
00:36:45,500 --> 00:36:48,000
30 years ago, I was the mayor of this joint.

492
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,680
If I wasn't working or sleeping, I was usually here.

493
00:36:50,680 --> 00:36:54,100
Right now, the economy’s not that bad in the country.

494
00:36:54,100 --> 00:36:56,980
It’s just the steel industry is in real trouble,

495
00:36:56,980 --> 00:37:02,670
and that's mainly due to imports
and trade rulings and things like that.

496
00:37:02,670 --> 00:37:07,240
Barack Obama wanted to do TPP,
we had a huge fight against that,

497
00:37:07,240 --> 00:37:09,520
we were totally opposed to that.

498
00:37:09,520 --> 00:37:14,220
We haven't had a lot of help from the government
when it comes to trade issues for…

499
00:37:14,220 --> 00:37:16,440
God, going back to before Bill Clinton.

500
00:37:16,600 --> 00:37:20,400
— But the plan is to reopen part of it
again, that's not helping?

501
00:37:20,540 --> 00:37:22,120
— Oh, it's helped some, yeah.

502
00:37:22,120 --> 00:37:26,200
But it's still, you know, 40% for sure.

503
00:37:26,420 --> 00:37:27,961
— You were rehired?
— Yes.

504
00:37:27,961 --> 00:37:29,680
Yeah, I went back in January.

505
00:37:29,840 --> 00:37:31,280
— You were…?
— I’m still laid-off.

506
00:37:31,400 --> 00:37:32,260
— Oh, you were not rehired.

507
00:37:32,420 --> 00:37:33,160
— No.

508
00:37:33,160 --> 00:37:37,700
I got laid-off  on the 29th of January in 2016, so…

509
00:37:37,860 --> 00:37:39,340
— You remember the day.

510
00:37:39,480 --> 00:37:40,080
— Yeah.

511
00:37:40,080 --> 00:37:44,180
It's been... 15, almost 15 months now.

512
00:37:44,180 --> 00:37:45,790
Just trying to get by, day by day.

513
00:37:45,790 --> 00:37:46,900
That's all you can do.

514
00:37:46,900 --> 00:37:52,800
And hope you're going to get that phone call,
and get called back to work, but...

515
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:55,640
you just don't know.

516
00:37:55,640 --> 00:37:56,760
— That's the hardest thing.

517
00:37:56,960 --> 00:38:00,140
— Mike, do you remember what it was like
when you got the phone call?

518
00:38:00,300 --> 00:38:02,640
— Yeah, I think I did a somersault, actually.

519
00:38:02,820 --> 00:38:03,940
— Do you feel secure in your job now?

520
00:38:04,140 --> 00:38:05,440
— No, I do not.

521
00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:08,920
I’m just worried about working in
the steel industry right now.

522
00:38:08,920 --> 00:38:12,100
Just because they hear that we're opening up,

523
00:38:12,100 --> 00:38:18,420
we are, but it's just a really, really, really small
amount of fortunate people that get to go back.

524
00:38:18,600 --> 00:38:22,900
— How does it make you feel
when the President steps up

525
00:38:22,900 --> 00:38:25,880
and takes credit for manufacturing jobs coming back?

526
00:38:26,060 --> 00:38:30,220
— We know well enough, after years and years
of doing that stuff,

527
00:38:30,220 --> 00:38:34,180
nobody's going to do anything in 100 days
that's gonna make something happen here now.

528
00:38:34,180 --> 00:38:39,040
He comes in, he signs an executive order,
and everybody thinks that just made it a law.

529
00:38:39,040 --> 00:38:40,720
I think it's pretty obvious, by the election,

530
00:38:40,720 --> 00:38:43,600
that a lot of people don't really know
how the government works.

531
00:38:57,060 --> 00:38:58,380
— My name is Heather Higginbottom,

532
00:38:58,380 --> 00:39:02,120
and I was the Deputy Secretary of State
for Management and Resources

533
00:39:02,120 --> 00:39:04,360
at the U.S. State Department.

534
00:39:04,360 --> 00:39:08,640
Some of the most important jobs to fill across
the government are the deputy positions.

535
00:39:08,640 --> 00:39:12,220
These are the number two positions
across all government agencies.

536
00:39:12,220 --> 00:39:15,040
When you don't have your senior positions filled,

537
00:39:15,040 --> 00:39:19,420
then you're not really being a good steward of
the federal government and its resources.

538
00:39:19,420 --> 00:39:24,280
Every transition, every administration goes
through a process of trying to fill positions,

539
00:39:24,280 --> 00:39:26,380
and it can take longer than people want.

540
00:39:26,380 --> 00:39:31,060
I don't think it's a crisis, but we really
need to see movement happening quickly,

541
00:39:31,060 --> 00:39:36,100
and we need to see people in these positions
empowered to to carry the policy agenda forward.

542
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:49,420
— This 100 days has been...

543
00:39:49,420 --> 00:39:52,280
it's like he's gambling
and playing with our lives.

544
00:39:52,280 --> 00:39:53,780
I have hope.

545
00:39:53,780 --> 00:39:56,940
I have hope for an impeachment process.

546
00:40:03,560 --> 00:40:05,520
— Things are happening so fast.

547
00:40:05,520 --> 00:40:07,240
Something happens almost every day.

548
00:40:07,240 --> 00:40:15,020
So I've got notes, but I've got 14 items on
the “pro” side, only one item on the “con” side,

549
00:40:15,020 --> 00:40:21,500
and that's in pencil, because that's
health care and health care is not settled yet.

550
00:40:21,500 --> 00:40:25,079
But we're only 100 days into a four year term.

551
00:40:25,080 --> 00:40:28,940
I think Trump’s on track to be one of
the greatest Presidents of history.

552
00:40:30,680 --> 00:40:33,900
— Let’s get your Trump shirt on.

553
00:40:34,060 --> 00:40:37,880
— If President Trump is watching this,
just keep on keeping on.

554
00:40:38,040 --> 00:40:43,800
— And also, I would say,
always stay in touch with the people.

555
00:40:43,800 --> 00:40:44,800
Always.

556
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:51,660
— Since inauguration, we received a lot of donations.

557
00:40:51,660 --> 00:40:53,180
We have new drums.

558
00:40:53,180 --> 00:40:57,440
We have the new blueprint for
the band room downstairs.

559
00:40:57,440 --> 00:40:59,240
I don't pay attention to any politics.

560
00:40:59,240 --> 00:41:01,930
I think the main reason why is,
I’m a college student.

561
00:41:01,930 --> 00:41:04,160
I have to do my work, I have to get it done.

562
00:41:08,740 --> 00:41:13,080
— I will say this is probably the most unique
first hundred days of any President.

563
00:41:13,080 --> 00:41:16,880
It's exciting because, as a Republican,
you have an opportunity to—

564
00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:19,160
things that I've been out here for six years trying to do,

565
00:41:19,160 --> 00:41:21,120
we now have an opportunity to do,

566
00:41:21,120 --> 00:41:23,840
to define government as Republican.

567
00:41:23,840 --> 00:41:25,920
But it's also been filled with a lot of disappointment.

568
00:41:25,920 --> 00:00:00,000
We'll see what the next couple hundred days look like.
