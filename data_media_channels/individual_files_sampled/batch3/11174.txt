members of Congress I had the high privilege and the distinct honor a prevent of presenting to you the President of the United States mr. speaker mr. vice president members of Congress the first lady of the United States and my fellow Americans less than one year has passed since I first stood at this podium in this majestic chamber to speak on behalf of the American people and to address their concerns their hopes and their dreams that night our new administration had already taken very swift action a new tide of optimism was already sweeping across our land each day since we have gone forward with a clear vision and a righteous mission to make America great again for all Americans over the last year we have made incredible progress and achieved extraordinary success we are faced challenges we expected and others we could never have imagined we have shared in the heights of victory and the pains of hardship we have endured floods and fires and storms but through it all we have seen the beauty of America soul and the steel in America's spine each test has forged new American heroes to remind us who we are and show us what we can be we saw the volunteers of the Cajun Navy racing to the rescue with their fishing boats to save people in the aftermath of a totally devastating hurricane we saw strangers shielding strangers from a hail of gunfire on the Las Vegas Strip we heard tales of Americans like Coast Guard Petty Officer Ashley Leppard who is here tonight in the gallery with melania Ashley was aboard one of the first helicopters on the scene in Houston during the hurricane Harvey through 18 hours of wind and rain Ashley braved live power lines and deep water to help save more than 40 lives Ashley we all thank you thank you very much we heard about Americans like firefighter David Dahlberg he's here with us also David faced down walls of flame to rescue almost 60 children trapped at a California summer camp threatened by those devastating wildfires to everyone still recovering in Texas Florida Louisiana Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands everywhere we are with you we love you and we always will pull through together always thank you to David and the brave people of California thank you very much David great job some trials over the past year touched this chamber very personally with us tonight is one of the toughest people ever to serve in this house a guy who took a bullet almost died and was back to work three and a half months later the legend from Louisiana congressman Steve Scalise I think they like you Steve we're incredibly grateful for the heroic efforts of the Capitol Police Officers the Alexandria Police and the doctors nurses and paramedics who saved his life and the lives of many others some in this room in the aftermath yes in the aftermath of that terrible shooting we came together not as Republicans or Democrats but as representatives of the people but it is not enough to come together only in times of tragedy tonight I call upon all of us to set aside our differences to seek out common ground and to summon the unity we need to deliver for the people this is really the key these are the people we were elected to serve over the last year the world has seen what we always know that no people on earth are so fearless or daring or determine as Americans if there is a mountain we climb it if there's a frontier we cross it if there's a challenge we tame it if there's an opportunity we seize it so let's begin tonight by recognizing that the state of our union is strong because our people are strong and together we are building a safe strong and proud America since the election we have created 2.4 million new jobs including including 200,000 new jobs in manufacturing alone tremendously after years and years of wage stagnation we are finally seeing rising wages unemployment claims have hit a 45-year low and something I'm very proud of african-american unemployment stands at the lowest rate ever recorded and Hispanic American unemployment has also reached the lowest levels in history small business confidence is at an all-time high the stock market has smashed one record after another gaining eight trillion dollars and more in value in just this short period of time the great news the great news for America's 401k retirement pension and college savings accounts have gone through the roof and just as I promised the American people from this podium 11 months ago we enacted the biggest tax cuts and reforms in American history our massive tax cuts provide tremendous relief for the middle class and small business to lower tax rates for hardworking Americans we nearly doubled the standard deduction for everyone now the first $24,000 earned by a married couple is completely tax-free we also doubled the child tax credit the typical family of four making $75,000 will see their tax bill reduced by $2,000 slashing their tax bill in half in April this will be the last time you will ever file under the old and very broken system and millions of Americans will have more take-home pay starting next month a lot more we eliminated an especially cruel tax that fell mostly on Americans making less than $50,000 a year forcing them to pay tremendous penalties simply because they couldn't afford government ordered health plans we repealed the core of the disastrous Obamacare the individual mandate is now gone we slashed the business tax rate from 35 percent all the way down to 21 percent so American companies can compete and win against anyone else anywhere in the world these changes alone are estimated to increase average family income by more than four thousand dollars a lot of money small businesses have also received a massive tax cut and can now deduct 20 percent of their business income here tonight our Steve Stoute and Sandy Keplinger of stout manufacturing a small beautiful business in Ohio they've just finished the best year in their 20 year history because of tax reform they are handing out raises hiring an additional 14 people and expanding into the building next door good feeling one of stabs employees Corey Adams is also with us tonight Corey is an all-american worker he supported himself through high school lost his job during the 2008 recession and was later hired by stab where he trained to become a welder like many hardworking Americans Corey plans to invest his tax cut rays into his new home and his two daughters education Corey please stand and he's a great welder I was told that by the man that owns that company that's doing so well so congratulations Cory since we passed tax cuts roughly three million workers have already gotten tax cut bonuses many of them thousands and thousands of dollars per worker and it's getting more every month every week Apple has just announced it plans to invest a total of 350 billion dollars in America and hire another 20,000 workers and just a little while ago ExxonMobil announced a fifty billion dollar investment in the United States just a little while this in fact is our new American moment there has never been a better time to start living the American dream so to every citizen watching at home tonight no matter where you've been or where you've come from this is your time if you work hard if you believe in yourself if you believe in America then you can dream anything you can be anything and together we can achieve absolutely anything tonight I want to talk about what kind of future we're going to have and what kind of a nation we're going to be all of us together as one team one people and one American family can do anything we all share the same home the same heart the same destiny and the same great American flag together we are rediscovering the American Way in America we know that faith and family not government and bureaucracy or the center of American life the motto is In God We Trust and we celebrate our police our military and our amazing veterans as heroes who deserve our total and unwavering support here tonight is Preston sharp a 12 year old boy from Redding California who noticed that Veterans graves were not marked with flags on Veterans Day he decided role by himself to change that and started a movement that has now placed 40,000 flags at the graves of our great heroes Preston a job well done young Patriots like Preston teach all of us about our civic duty as Americans and I met past in a little while ago and he is something very special that I can tell you great future thank you very much for all you've done Preston thank you very much Preston's reverence for those who have served our nation reminds us of why we salute our flag why we put our hands on our hearts for the pledge of allegiance and why we proudly stand for the national anthem Americans love their country and they deserve a government that shows them the same love and loyalty in return for the last year we have sought to restore the bonds of trust between our citizens and their government working with the Senate we are appointing judges who will interpret the Constitution as written including a great new Supreme Court justice and more Circuit Court judges than any new administration in the history of our country we are totally defending our Second Amendment and have taken historic actions to protect religious liberty and we are serving our brave veterans including giving our veterans choice in their health care decisions last year Congress also passed and I signed the landmark va Accountability Act since its passage my administration has already removed more than 1500 VA employees who fail to give our veterans the care they deserve and we are hiring talented people who love our vets as much as we do and I will not stop until our veterans are properly taken care of which has been my promise to them from the very beginning of this great journey all Americans deserve accountability and respect and that's what we are giving to our wonderful heroes our veterans thank you so tonight I call on Congress to empower every cabinet secretary with the authority to reward good workers and to remove federal employees who undermine the public trust or fail the American people in our drive to make Washington accountable we have eliminated more regulations in our first year than any Administration in the history of our country we have ended the war on American energy and we have ended the war on beautiful clean coal we are now very proudly an exporter of energy to the world in Detroit I halted government mandates that crippled America's great beautiful Auto Workers so that we can get Motor City revving its engines again and that's what's happening many car companies are now building and expanding plants in the United States something we haven't seen for decades Chrysler is moving a major plant from Mexico to Michigan Toyota and Mazda are opening up a plant in Alabama a big one and we haven't seen this in a long time it's all coming back very soon auto plants and other plants will be opening up all over our country this is all news Americans are totally unaccustomed to here for many years companies and jobs were only leaving us but now they are roaring back they're coming back they want to be where the action is they want to be in the United States of America that's what they want exciting progress is happening every single day to speed access to breakthrough cures and affordable generic drugs last year the FDA approved more new and generic drugs and medical devices than ever before in our country's history we also believe that patients with terminal conditions terminal illness should have access to experimental treatment immediately that could potentially save their lives people who are terminally ill should not have to go from country to country to seek a cure I want to give them a chance right here at home it's time for Congress to give these wonderful incredible Americans the right to tribe one of my greatest priorities is to reduce the price of prescription drugs in many other countries these drugs cost far less than what we pay in the United States and it's very very unfair that is why I've directed my administration to make fixing the injustice of high drug prices one of my top priorities for the year and prices will come down substantially watch America has also finally turned the page on decades of unfair trade deals that sacrificed our prosperity and shipped away our companies our jobs and our wealth our nation has lost its wealth but we're getting it back so fast the era of economic surrender is totally over from now on we expect trading relationships to be fair and very importantly reciprocal we will work to fix bad trade deals and negotiate new ones and they'll be good ones but they'll be fair and we will protect American workers and American intellectual property through strong enforcement of our trade rules as we rebuild our industries it is also time to rebuild our crumbling infrastructure America is a nation of builders we built the Empire State Building in just one year isn't it a disgrace that it can now take ten years just to get a minor permit approved for the building of a simple road I am asking both parties to come together to give us safe fast reliable and modern infrastructure that our economy needs and our people deserve tonight I'm calling on Congress to produce a bill that generates at least 1.5 trillion dollars for the new infrastructure investment that our country so desperately needs every federal dollar should be leveraged by partnering with state and local governments and where appropriate tapping into private sector investment to permanently fix the infrastructure deficit and we can do it any bill must also streamline the permitting and approval process getting it down to no more than two years and perhaps even one together we can reclaim our great building heritage we will build gleaming new roads bridges highways railways and waterways all across our land and we will do it with American Heart and American hands and American grit we want every American to know the dignity of a hard day's work we want every child to be safe in their home at night and we want every citizen to be proud of this land that we all love so much we can lift our citizens from welfare to work from dependence to independence and from poverty to prosperity as tax cuts create new jobs let's invest in Workforce Development and let's invest in job training which we need so badly let's open great vocational schools so our future workers can learn a craft and realise their full potential and let's support working families by supporting paid family leave as America regains its strength opportunity must be extended to all citizens that is why this year we will embark on reforming our prisons to help former inmates who have served their time get a second chance at life struggling communities especially immigrant communities will also be helped by immigration policies that focus on the best interests of American workers and American families for decades open borders have allowed drugs and gangs to pour into our most vulnerable communities they've allowed millions of low-wage workers to compete for jobs and wages against the poorest Americans most tragically they have caused the loss of many innocent lives here tonight our two fathers and two mothers Evelyn Rodriguez Freddie Cuevas Elisabeth Alvarado and Robert nickens their two teenage daughters Kayla Cuevas and Nisa Mickens were close friends on Long Island but in September 2016 on the eve of niece's 16th birthday such a happy time it should have been neither of them came home these two precious girls were brutally murdered murdered while walking together in their hometown six members of the savage ms-13 gang have been charged with Kayla and niece's murders many of these gang members took advantage of glaring loopholes in our laws to enter the country as illegal unaccompanied alien minors and wound up in Kayla and niece's high school Evelyn Elizabeth Freddie and Robert tonight everyone in this chamber is praying for you everyone in America is grieving for you please stand thank you very much I want you to know that 320 million hearts are right now breaking for you we love you thank you while we cannot imagine the depths of that kind of sorrow we can make sure that other families never have to endure this kind of pain tonight I am calling on Congress to finally close the deadly loopholes that have allowed ms-13 and other criminal gangs to break into our country we have proposed new legislation that will fix our immigration laws and support our ice and Border Patrol agents these are great people these are great great people that work so hard in the midst of such danger so that this can never happen again the United States is a compassionate nation we are proud that we do more than any other country anywhere in the world to help the needy the struggling and the underprivileged all over the world but as president of the United States my highest loyalty my greatest compassion my constant concern is for America's children America's struggling workers and America's forgotten communities I want our youth to grow up to achieve great things I want our poor to have their chance to rise so tonight I am extending an open hand to work with members of both parties Democrats and Republicans to protect our citizens of every background color religion and Creed my duty and the sacred duty of every elected official in this chamber is to defend Americans to protect their safety their families their communities and their right to the American Dream because Americans are dreamers too here tonight is one leader in the effort to defend our country Homeland Security Investigations special agent Celestino Martinez he goes by DJ and CJ he said call me either one so we'll call you CJ sir 15 years in the Air Force before becoming an ice agent and spending the last 15 years fighting gang violence and getting dangerous criminals off of our streets tough job at one point ms-13 leaders ordered CJ's murder and they wanted it to happen quickly but he did not cave to threats or to fear last May he commanded an operation to track down gang members on Long Island his team has arrested nearly 400 including more than 220 ms-13 gang members and I have to tell you what the Border Patrol and ice have done we have sent thousands and thousands and thousands of ms-13 horrible people out of this country or into our prisons so I just want to congratulate you CJ you're a brave guy thank you very much and is CJ what's the secret he said we're just tougher than they are and I like that in now let's get Congress to send you and all of the people in this great chamber have to do it we have no choice CJ we're going to send you reinforcements and we're going to send them to you quickly that's what your name over the next few weeks the House and Senate will be voting on an immigration reform package in recent months my administration has met extensively with both Democrats and Republicans to craft a bipartisan approach to immigration reform based on these discussions we presented Congress with a detailed proposal that should be supported by both parties as a fair compromise one where nobody gets everything they want but where our country gets the critical reforms it needs and must have here are the four pillars of our plan the first pillar of our framework generously offers a path to citizenship for 1.8 million illegal immigrants who were brought here by their parents at a young age that covers almost three times more people than the previous administration covered under our plan those who meet education and work requirements and show good moral character will be able to become full citizens of the United States over a 12-year period the second pillar fully secures the border that means building a great wall on the southern border and it means hiring more heroes like CJ to keep our communities safe crucially our plan closes the terrible loopholes exploited by criminals and terrorists to enter our country and it finally ends the horrible and dangerous practice of catch and release the third pillar ends the visa lottery a program that randomly hands out green cards without any regard for skill merit or the safety of American people it's time to begin moving toward a merit-based immigration system one that admits people who are skilled who want to work who will contribute to our society and who will love and respect our country the fourth and final pillar protects the nuclear family by ending chain migration under the current broken system a single immigrant can bring in virtually unlimited numbers of distant relatives under our plan we focus on the immediate family by limiting sponsorships to spouses and minor children this vital reform is necessary not just for our economy but for our security and for the future of America in recent weeks two terrorist attacks in New York were made possible by the Visa Lottery and chain migration in the age of terrorism these programs present risks we can just no longer afford it's time to reform these outdated immigration rules and finally bring our immigration system into the 21st century these four pillars represent a down the middle compromise and one that will create a safe modern and lawful immigration system for over 30 years Washington has tried and failed to solve this problem this Congress can be the one that finally makes it happen most importantly these four pillars will produce legislation that fulfills my ironclad pledge to sign a bill that puts America first so let's come together set politics aside and finally get the job done these reforms will also support our response to the terrible crisis of opioid and drug addiction never before has it been like it is now it is terrible we have to do something about it in 2016 we lost 64 thousand Americans to drug overdoses 174 deaths per day seven per hour we must get much tougher on drug dealers and pushers if we are going to succeed in stopping this scourge my administration is committed to fighting the drug epidemic and helping get treatment for those in need for those who have been so terribly hurt the struggle will be long and it will be difficult but as Americans always do in the end we will succeed we will prevail as we have seen tonight the most difficult challenges bring out the best in America we see a vivid expression of this truth in the story of the ohlet's family of New Mexico Ryan ha let's is 27 years old an officer with the Albuquerque Police Department he's here tonight with his wife Rebecca Thank You Ryan last year Ryan was on duty when he saw a pregnant homeless woman preparing to inject heroin when Ryan told her she was going to harm her unborn child she began to weep she told him she didn't know where to turn but badly wanted a safe home for her baby in that moment Ryan said he felt God speak to him you will do it because you can he heard those words he took out a picture of his wife and their four kids then he went home to tell his wife Rebecca in an instant she agreed to adopt the whole let's named their new daughter hope Ryan and Rebecca you embody the goodness of our nation thank you Thank You Ryan and Rebecca as we rebuild America's strength and confidence at home we are also restoring our strength and standing abroad around the world we face rogue regimes terrorist groups and rivals like China and Russia that challenge our interests our economy and our values in confronting these horrible dangers we know that weakness is the surest path to conflict an unmatched power is the surest means to our true and great defense for this reason I am asking Congress to end the dangerous defense sequester and fully fund our great military as part of our defense we must modernize and rebuild our nuclear arsenal hopefully never having to use it but making it so strong and so powerful that it will deter any acts of aggression by any other nation or anyone else perhaps someday in the future there will be a magical moment when the countries of the world will get together to eliminate their nuclear weapons unfortunately we are not there yet sadly last year I also pledged that we would work with our allies to extinguish Isis from the face of the earth one year later I am proud to report that the coalition to defeat Isis has liberated very close to 100% of the territory just recently held by these killers in Iraq and in Syria and in other locations as well but there is much more work to be done we will continue our fight until Isis is defeated Army Staff Sergeant Justin Peck is here tonight near Raqqa last November Justin and his comrade chief petty officer Kenton Stasi we're on a mission to clear buildings that Isis had rigged with explosives so that civilians could return to that city hopefully soon and hopefully safely clearing the second floor of a vital hospital Kenton Stasi was severely wounded by an explosion immediately Justin bounded into the booby-trapped and unbelievably dangerous and unsafe building and found Kenton but in very very bad shape he applied pressure to the wound and inserted a tube to reopen an airway he then performed CPR for 20 straight minutes during the ground transport and maintained artificial respiration through two and a half hours and through emergency surgery Kenton Stacy would have died if it were not for Justin's selfless love for his fellow warrior tonight Kenton is recovering in Texas Raqqa is liberated and Justin is wearing his new Bronze Star with a V for valor Staff Sergeant heck all of America see terrorists who do things like place bombs in civilian hospitals are evil when possible we have no choice but to annihilate them when necessary we must be able to detain and question them but we must be clear terrorists are not merely criminals they are unlawful enemy combatants and when captured overseas they should be treated like the terrorists they are in the past we have foolishly released hundreds and hundreds of dangerous territories only to meet them again on the battlefield including the Isis leader al Baghdadi who we captured who we had who we released so today I'm keeping another promise I just signed prior to walking in an order directing secretary mattis who is doing a great job thank you to reexamine our military detention policy and to keep open the detention facilities in Guantanamo Bay I am asking Congress to ensure that in the fight against Isis and al-qaeda we continue to have all necessary power to detain terrorists wherever we chase them down wherever we find them and in many cases them it will now be Guantanamo Bay at the same time as of a few months ago our warriors in Afghanistan have new rules of engagement along with their heroic Afghan partners our military is no longer undermined by artificial timelines and we no longer tell our enemies our plans last month I also took an action endorsed unanimously by the US Senate just months before I recognized Jerusalem as the capital of Israel shortly afterwards dozens of countries voted in the United Nations General Assembly against America's sovereign right to make this decision in 2016 American taxpayers generously sent those same countries more than twenty billion dollars in aid that is why tonight I am asking Congress to pass legislation to help ensure American foreign assistance dollars always serve American interests and only go to Friends of America not enemies as we strengthen friendships all around the world we are also restoring clarity about our adversaries when the people of Iran rose up against the crimes of their corrupt dictatorship I did not stay silent America stands with the people of Iran in their courageous struggle for freedom I am asking Congress to address the fundamental flaws in the terrible Iran nuclear deal my administration has also imposed tough sanctions on the communist and socialist dictatorships in Cuba and Venezuela but no regime has oppressed its own citizens more totally or brutally than the cruel dictatorship in North Korea North Korea's reckless pursuit of nuclear missiles could very soon threaten our homeland we are waging a campaign of maximum pressure to prevent that from ever happening past experience has taught us that complacency and concessions only invite aggression and provocation I will not repeat the mistakes of past administrations that got us into this very dangerous position we need only look at the depraved character of the North Korean regime to understand the nature of the nuclear threat it could pose to America and to our allies otto warmbier was a hard-working student at the University of Virginia and a great student he was on his way to study abroad in Asia I don't a tour to North Korea at its conclusion this wonderful young man was arrested and charged with crimes against the state after a shameful trial the dictatorship sentenced otto to 15 years of hard labor before returning him to America last June horribly injured and on the verge of death he passed away just days after his return Otto's wonderful parents Fred and Cindy warmbier are here with us tonight along with Otto's brother and sister Austin and Greta please credible people you are powerful witnesses to a menace that threatens our world and your strength truly inspires us all thank you very much tonight we pledge to honor Otto's memory with total American resolve thank you finally we are joined by one more witness to the ominous nature of this regime his name is mr. ji sung ho in 1996 sung ho was a starving boy in North Korea one day he tried to steal coal from a railroad car to barter for a few scraps of food which were very hard to get in the process he passed out on the train tracks exhausted from hunger he woke up as a train ran over his limbs he then endured multiple amputations without anything to dull the pain or the hurt his brother and sister gave what little food they had to help him recover and ate dirt themselves permanently stunting their own growth later he was tortured by North Korean authorities after returning from a brief visit to China his tormentors wanted to know if he'd met any Christians he had and he resolved after that to be free Seung ho travel thousands of miles on crutches all across China and Southeast Asia to freedom most of his family followed his father was caught trying to escape and was tortured to death today he lives in Seoul where he rescues other defectors and broadcasts into North Korea what the regime fears most the truth today he has a new lake but seung-ho I understand you still keep those old crutches as a reminder of how far you've come your great sacrifice is an inspiration to us all please thank you seung-ho story is a testament to the yearning of every human soul to live in freedom it was that same yearning for freedom that nearly two hundred and fifty years ago gave birth to a special place called America it was a small cluster of colonies caught between a great ocean and a vast wilderness it was home to an incredible people with a revolutionary idea that they could rule themselves that they could chart their own destiny and that together they could light up the entire world that is what our country has always been about that is what Americans have always stood for always strived for and always done atop the dome of this Capitol stands the statue of freedom she stands tall and dignified among the monuments to our ancestors who fought and lived and died to protect her monuments to Washington and Jefferson and Lincoln and King memorials to the heroes of Yorktown and Saratoga to young Americans who shed their blood on the shores of Normandy and the fields beyond and others who went down in the waters of the Pacific and the skies all over Asia and freedom stands tall over one more monument this one this Capitol this living monument this is the monument to the American people we're a people whose heroes live not only in the past but all around us defending hope pride and defending the American Way they work in every tray they sacrifice to raise a family they care for our children at home they defend our flag abroad and they are strong moms and brave kids they are firefighters and police officers and border agents medics and Marines but above all else they are Americans and this capital this city this nation belongs entirely to them our task is to respect them to listen to them to serve them to protect them and to always be worthy of them Americans fill the world with art and music they push the bounds of science and discovery and they forever remind us of what we should never ever forget the people dreamed this country the people built this country and it's the people who are making America great again as long as we are proud of who we are and what we are fighting for there is nothing we cannot achieve as long as we have confidence in our values faith in our citizens and trust in our God we will never fail our families will thrive our people will prosper and our nation will forever be safe and strong and proud and mighty and free thank you and God bless america good night
