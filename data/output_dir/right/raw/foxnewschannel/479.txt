1
00:00:13,478 --> 00:00:14,112
>> NORTH KOREA AGREED TO

2
00:00:14,112 --> 00:00:14,646
DISMANTLE THE SITE.

3
00:00:14,646 --> 00:00:15,380
ONLY IF IT HAS THE FORCES IN

4
00:00:15,380 --> 00:00:18,783
SOUTH KOREA FIRST.

5
00:00:18,783 --> 00:00:19,517
THE FOREIGN MINISTER SPEAKING

6
00:00:19,517 --> 00:00:20,085
BEFORE THE UN TODAY.

7
00:00:20,085 --> 00:00:20,819
WITHOUT ANY TRUST IN THE U.S.

8
00:00:20,819 --> 00:00:27,158
THERE WILL BE NO CONFIDENCE IN

9
00:00:27,158 --> 00:00:27,792
OUR NATIONAL SECURITY AND

10
00:00:27,792 --> 00:00:28,460
UNDER SUCH CIRCUMSTANCE AS

11
00:00:28,460 --> 00:00:29,127
THERE IS NO WAY WE WOULD

12
00:00:29,127 --> 00:00:33,064
DISARM OURSELVES FIRST.

13
00:00:33,064 --> 00:00:42,373
IT'S GREAT TO HAVE YOU HERE.

14
00:00:42,373 --> 00:00:43,108
THE PRESIDENT AND SECRETARY OF

15
00:00:43,108 --> 00:00:43,742
STATE SAYS WE ARE REAL

16
00:00:43,742 --> 00:00:49,214
PROGRESS THE ONE THING WE CAN

17
00:00:49,214 --> 00:00:52,584
SAY WE DON'T SEE WHAT'S GOING

18
00:00:52,584 --> 00:00:53,318
ON BEHIND THE SCENES BUT THE

19
00:00:53,318 --> 00:00:54,186
ONE THING YOU CAN'T SAY IS

20
00:00:54,186 --> 00:00:59,758
WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE FOREIGN

21
00:00:59,758 --> 00:01:00,392
MINISTER OF NORTH KOREA'S

22
00:01:00,392 --> 00:01:01,093
SPEECH THERE WAS NO SIGN OF

23
00:01:01,093 --> 00:01:01,526
REAL PROGRESS.

24
00:01:01,526 --> 00:01:02,327
THE SECOND HALF OF THAT SPEECH

25
00:01:02,327 --> 00:01:09,534
WAS QUITE BELLIGERENT.

26
00:01:09,534 --> 00:01:10,168
THEY SAID THE FOLLOWING.

27
00:01:10,168 --> 00:01:10,902
THE PERCEPTION THAT SANCTIONS

28
00:01:10,902 --> 00:01:11,670
CAN BRING US ON OUR NEEDS AS A

29
00:01:11,670 --> 00:01:12,371
PIPE DREAM OF THE PEOPLE WHO

30
00:01:12,371 --> 00:01:13,739
ARE IGNORANT ABOUT US.

31
00:01:13,739 --> 00:01:17,242
THEY ARE DEEPENING THE

32
00:01:17,242 --> 00:01:19,011
MISTRUST.

33
00:01:19,011 --> 00:01:27,553
THE THING IS IF THEY DON'T

34
00:01:27,553 --> 00:01:28,387
HAVE AN EFFECT WHY GO ON ABOUT

35
00:01:28,387 --> 00:01:28,687
THEM.

36
00:01:28,687 --> 00:01:29,254
THAT'S WHAT HE DID.

37
00:01:29,254 --> 00:01:29,988
THE WHOLE THING IN THE SPEECH

38
00:01:29,988 --> 00:01:32,891
YOU CAN HEAR IT THROUGHOUT THE

39
00:01:32,891 --> 00:01:33,458
PROBLEM IS MISTRUST.

40
00:01:33,458 --> 00:01:34,092
AND THE REASON WHY IT'S

41
00:01:34,092 --> 00:01:34,760
MISTRUST IS BECAUSE OF THE

42
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:39,398
UNITED STATES.

43
00:01:39,398 --> 00:01:40,098
BLAMING US FROM EVERYTHING

44
00:01:40,098 --> 00:01:40,566
UNDER THE SUN.

45
00:01:40,566 --> 00:01:41,333
RIGHT NOW, OF COURSE THERE IS

46
00:01:41,333 --> 00:01:42,668
A LOT OF MISTRUST.

47
00:01:42,668 --> 00:01:45,537
BECAUSE THEY INVADED THE SOUTH

48
00:01:45,537 --> 00:01:50,976
KOREANS OF 1950s.

49
00:01:50,976 --> 00:01:51,643
AND THEY SAID DON'T WORRY

50
00:01:51,643 --> 00:01:52,344
ABOUT THE PAST OBVIOUSLY WE

51
00:01:52,344 --> 00:01:55,647
SHOULD.

52
00:01:55,647 --> 00:01:57,116
>> THE GAMES THEY ARE

53
00:01:57,116 --> 00:02:00,953
PLAYING.

54
00:02:00,953 --> 00:02:01,553
WE ARE SEEING THE SAME

55
00:02:01,553 --> 00:00:00,000
PLAYBOOK FROM KIM JUNG UN.
