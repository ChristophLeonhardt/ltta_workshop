REDDIT HAS LAUNCHED ITS
NEWEST WAVE OF COMMUNITY BANS.
THEY'RE WIPING A CERTAIN
SUB-REDDITS THAT THEY BELIEVE
INSIGHT VIOLENCE OR LEAD TO
CERTAIN FORMS OF HATE SPEECH.
PEOPLE ARE NOT HAPPY ABOUT THIS
ESPECIALLY CONSIDERING THE FACT
THAT REDDIT HAD ALREADY HAD DONE
SOMETHING SIMILAR BACK IN 2015
AND PEOPLE WHO LIKE TO ENGAGE IN
THIS TYPE OF RHETORIC FEEL LIKE
THEIR SPEECHES BEING ATTACKED.
SO THEY RELEASED A STATEMENT
ABOUT THIS AND THEY WANTED TO
CLARIFY WHAT THEY MEANT IN
REGARD TO SUB REDDITS OR
COMMUNITIES THAT ARE
UNACCEPTABLE.
SO FAR, AS WE FILM THIS VIDEO,
THEY HAVE DONE AWAY WITH 18
COMMUNITIES.
POL IS SOME SORT OF EXTENSION OF
4CHAN YOU CAN IMAGINE THE
KIND OF CONVERSATION THAT WOULD
TAKE PLACE THERE.
THEY ALSO GOT RID OF SEX WITH
HORSES.
WHICH ACTUALLY IS PART
OF MY POINT.
AS USUAL, READY IS
A PRIVATE COMPANY AND THEY COULD
DO WHATEVER THEY WANT AND IT IS
NOT A FIRST AMENDMENT ISSUE.
IF
SOMEONE DOESN'T ONE SEX WITH
HORSES ON THEIR WEBSITE, YOU
HAVE TO BE ENTERED ABLE TO
UNDERSTAND THAT, REQUEST OF
THEIR NON-FAVOR OF BEASTIALITY
ARE NOT SEASON THERE CERTAINLY
NONE FAVOR OF ENCOURAGING
VIOLENCE SO I THINK IT IS THE
RIGHT MOVE.
I THINK THEY HAVE
EVERY RIGHT IN THE WORLD TO DO
THAT BUT I DO WANT TO DRAW A
DISTINCTION HERE.
THE DAILY
STORMER WHICH IS A NEO-NAZI
WEBSITE WHICH IS ATROCIOUS,
TERRIBLE, ETC., HAS BEEN
REJECTED BY SEVERAL WEB
COMPANIES AND NOW THEY'RE ON THE
DARK WEB AND THE ELECTRONIC
FRONTIER FOUNDATION WHICH BITES
HER INTERNET FREEDOM DISAGREES
WITH THAT AND I AGREE WITH THEM.
I THINK THAT IS A DIFFERENT
SITUATION BECAUSE THAT IS THEIR
OWN WEBSITE AND IT IS NOT
ALLOWED TO BE ON THE
REGULAR INTERNET.
IT IS NOT NECESSARILY A
GOVERNMENT ISSUE SO I AM
NOT SAYING IT IS
UNCONSTITUTIONAL, I JUST
DON'T AGREE WITH THAT POLICY.
BUT NOW YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT
VARIOUS PROVIDERS.
WHERE YOU
WOULD GO BUY THE URL OR AN
ONLINE ADDRESS FOR YOUR WEBSITE.
NOW
YOU ARE ESSENTIALLY, YOU'RE NOT
PRESSURING THEM BECAUSE YOU ARE
NOT SAYING THAT THEY SHOULD FACE
ANY SORT OF LEGAL RAMIFICATION
BUT THOSE ARE PRIVATE BENEFIT
BUSINESSES AS WELL.
GO DADDY GETS TO MAKE A
DECISION.
IF THEY DO NOT WANT TO HOST THAT
WEBSITE, THEY DON'T HAVE TO
HOST THAT WEBSITE.
I KNOW, THAT IS ABSOLUTELY
TRUE LEGALLY AND IT IS A
SUPERHARD DECISION BECAUSE THEY
ARE NAZIS.
IT IS VERY
UNDERSTANDABLE WHY GO DADDY OR
ANY OTHER COMPANY WOULD NOT ONE
TO BE ASSOCIATED THEM WITH IN
ANY WAY SHAPE OR FORM BUT IF
EVERYONE OF THOSE COMPANIES DO
THAT, THEY START TO EXPAND A
LITTLE BIT AND GO OKAY, THEN I
DON'T LIKE THIS KIND OF
CONTENT OR THAT KIND OF CONTENT.
THAT IS 
A DANGEROUS PRECEDENT.
