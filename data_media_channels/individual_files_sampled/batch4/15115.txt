yes even in the world of fun and games there's a different set of rules for Israel case in point the Abu Dhabi Grand Slam of Judo is forbidding Israeli athletes to wear national emblems and if an Israeli competitor is good enough to win a gold medal well the Israeli national anthem will not be played per standard protocol it's blatant discrimination of course and it has prompted Israel's culture and Sports Minister Miri Regev to write a letter to the International judo Federation quote the demand by tournament organisers to appear without symbols as contrary to the Mandate of international sports associations the main aim of which is to separate politics from sport end quote yes folks remember the good old days when politics and sports were separate entities these days one can't pick up the sports section of a newspaper without mistakenly believing you're reading the op-ed section and it's especially shameful in the Middle East when it comes to sports tournaments involving Israel it is now due regard that Israel's participation will typically lead to hostile reactions and even boycotts from Arab or Muslim organizations or athletes indeed check out this from last year's Olympic Games in Rio Egyptian judo competitor Islam al shahab ii refused to shake hands with his israeli opponent or SAS on who had just defeated them i think this is what's called being a sore loser on the plus side at least there was no repeat of the mass murder of israeli athletes at the hands of palestinian terrorists as was the case in 1972 anyway I'm sure the IOC will get right on this file hey maybe they'll make the Israeli judo team only compete against European squads you know pretend Israel is part of Europe rather than the Middle East that's how the people at FIFA running the world cup of soccer do things faced with too many Muslim nations stating they wouldn't share the same soccer pitch with Israeli players Israel has the qualify for the World Cup by playing powerhouse European teams rather than those squads in it so region yeah the world cup solution is to appease the bullies how shameful that's an excerpt from my daily TV show the Ezra Levant show normally it's behind a paywall but I thought you'd like this video so we put it on YouTube if you want to subscribe to watch the daily show every day including always two interviews today and I read my hate mail just click on this screen and become a Premium Member you
