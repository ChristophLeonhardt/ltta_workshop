TONY: AT HER ESTATE MIKE POMPEO
HITTING IRAN WITH THE STRONGEST
SANCTIONS IN HISTORY PLANNING A
PRESSURE CAMPAIGN IF IT DOESN'T
ABANDON NUCLEAR WORK.
ROB: EUROPE REASSURING IRAN IS
COMMITTED TO SALVAGING THE
NUCLEAR DEAL WITH OR WITHOUT THE
US.
WHY ARE OUR ALLIES SIDING WITH
THE COUNTRY KNOWN FOR ITS
FINANCIAL BACKING OF TERROR
ORGANIZATIONS?
HEATHER: HERE IS THE LEADER OF
THE BREXIT  MOVEMENT, NIGEL
FARAGE.
>> THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION AND
OTHERS MAKE THE DECISIONS FOR
THE EU.
THE BIG BANKS AND BIG BUSINESSES
ARE PREDOMINANT IN EVERYTHING WE
DO.
SINCE THE OBAMA DEAL A LOT OF
EUROPEAN COMPANIES HAVE INVESTED
IN IRAN AND THE REASON FOR
KEEPING VIDEOS TO PROTECT THE
INTERESTS OF COMPANIES WHO CARE
MORE ABOUT THEIR BOTTOM LINE
THAN THE SAFETY OF THE WORLD.
ALL OF THIS LEAVES THE UK IN A
DIFFICULT POSITION.
BORIS JOHNSON IS SIDING WITH THE
EUROPEAN UNION IN BRUSSELS AND
NOT AMERICA AND MANY WANT HIM TO
CHANGE HIS MIND.
ROB: HOW EFFECTIVE ARE THESE
SANCTIONS?
THE US IS ABLE TO PERMIT THE
STRONGEST SANCTIONS EVER ON
IRAN.
HOW EFFECTIVE WILL THAT BE IN
CHANGING THE COUNTRY WITH THE
EUROPEAN UNION DOING BUSINESS
WITH THIS COUNTRY?
>> IT WAS THE WAY TRUMP GOT
CHINA TO BE SERIOUS ON SANCTIONS
WITH NORTH KOREA, EFFECTIVELY A
MAJOR REASON, TO THE NEGOTIATING
TABLE.
AND A LOT OF MONEY WILL COME
INTO YOUR COUNTRY.
THE EUROPEAN UNION, DIFFICULT TO
SEE HOW EFFECTIVE THE AMERICAN
POLICY CAN BE IF THESE PEOPLE
CONTINUE ON THEIR CURRENT
COURSE.
JILLIAN: IT IS NOT A PIPE DREAM
TO ASK THE URANIUM LEADERSHIP TO
BEHAVE LIKE A NORMAL RESPONSIBLE
COUNTRY.
DO YOU THINK IT IS SIMPLE?
>> I THINK TO RENEGOTIATE A BAD
DEAL IS A SENSIBLE, GROWN-UP
THING TO DO.
THIS IRAN HE AND REGIME HAS BEEN
IN POWER FOR 40 YEARS BY ISLAMIC
FUNDAMENTALISTS, FANATICS.
AND IN LIBYA, OR IN A RACK,
WOULD BE A DIFFERENT DIMENSION
AND THAT IS WHY THE EU WERE TO
JOIN WITH AMERICA IN TOUGH
SANCTIONS ON IRAN THAT COULD
JUST LEAD TO PEOPLE BRINGING
DOWN THE ISLAMIC REGIME.
ROB: EMMANUEL MACRON CAME HERE
AND MET WITH THE PRESIDENT AND
SAID HE DOESN'T LIKE THE DEAL OR
THINK THE DEAL IS STRONG ENOUGH
BUT HIS CONCERN WAS WALKING AWAY
AT THIS POINT REDUCES OUR
CREDIBILITY IF WE WERE TO DO SO.
DO YOU THINK THE US LOST
CREDIBILITY IN A DEALMAKING
POSITION BY WALKING AWAY FROM A
DEAL?
>> KNOW.
IT IS CALLED DEMOCRACY.
OBAMA CHOSE TO PUT THE DEAL IN
PLACE.
HE STARTED IN GOOD FAITH, HOPING
IRAN WOULD BEHAVE THEMSELVES
ONCE THEIR ASSETS WERE FREE,
IRAN ACTUALLY THROUGH HEZBOLLAH,
HAMAS AND ITS ASSOCIATES AND
PROCESSES HAVE BEHAVED TERRIBLY.
THE AMERICAN ELECTORATE MADE A
DECISION, THEY VOTED FOR DONALD
TRUMP WHO SAID, THAT MAKES IT
LOOK LIKE A PROPER DEMOCRATIC
COUNTRY PREPARED TO GET THINGS
WRONG.
HEATHER: WE APPEAR GO WHEN
THERE'S A LOT OF CHANGE
HAPPENING SINCE THE
ADMINISTRATION TOOK OFFICE, DO
YOU THINK A LOT OF ALLIES WILL
COME ON BOARD WITH CHANGES
INCLUDING THIS?
>> I WORRY ABOUT THE EUROPEAN
UNION.
IT IS VERY MUCH INFLUENCED BY
BIG BANKS AND BIG BUSINESSES.
MONEY TALKS IN THIS CITY AND
THERE IS ROOM HERE FOR US IN THE
UNITED KINGDOM TO REVISIT THIS
AND I VERY MUCH BELIEVE THE WAY
DONALD TRUMP COMES TO THE UNITED
KINGDOM JULY 13TH WITH THERESA
MAY.
AND MAYBE MACRON AND OTHERS WILL
START TO THINK.
>> ON A LIGHTER NOTE YOU THROW A
HECKUVA WEDDING.
