so who are the 161 Canadian piggies at the trough this year according to this provisional delegate list well showed you the first name of the Canadians on the list the hapless Stephane Dion he got thrashed in the 2008 election Canada just destroyed for running on an anti global warming platform you remember it was called the green shift but he's got the last laugh hasn't he he's our overpaid special envoy to Europe then there's Catherine McKenna the Environment Minister and as I showed you earlier the next four names on the delegates list are extremely well paid people who really all have different varieties of the same jobs idol ambassador for climate change negotiator for climate change senior policy analyst for climate change ahead of climate action senior policy analyst for negotiations of course when you see the word seen here in the title that implies there's also a junior person like that to folks there is no Factory in Canada making Tesla's by the way there aren't thousands of people making solar panels in Canada for a living when politicians talk about green jobs these are the jobs they mean bureaucrats and lawyers and lobbyists and mooches the only green here is the money they get paid these are the green jobs but here's a key point every global warming loser in the country well they got on board from from the provinces from cities anyone who wants a free trip to Bonn or maybe take your free trip to Bonn and then while you're there you just hop on a quick training you go exploring in the rest of Europe instead I mean it's not very far to take a train into Paris just a few hours I mean would anyone really notice if the deputy assistant policy negotiator advised her global warming deputy went missing for a couple of days how would anyone even know I'm not going to go through every one that 161 names but here's just one Claude Odette Robitaille who is a Quebec government bureaucrat for every federal government bureaucrat on the global warming file you can expect each province has the same provincial version then so do probably the territory so just picking this moment as an example x 13 for each of the provinces and territories here's another one David Brent Bleek nee the Postal Workers Union has someone on the delegation what what yeah well why not it's a party here's Kaylee Frampton no I mean I was picking a name a random Kayla Brandon she's described as a ministerial assistant office of the Minister British Columbia Ministry of Environment and climate change change strategy they all have these very long titles don't they their business cards must be huge so who is Kaylee what kind of an assistant huge job title but it actually says very little doesn't it well here's her LinkedIn page she took photography in college I'm in women's studies of course and then she says this I'm quoting from her resume as part of the digital team during the BC election campaign I worked as a Content producer writing and editing content for digital platforms oh so she was a propaganda photographer for the campaign why why yes she was and she's apparently quite good I look at this she has her own company so the BC need Democrats instead of hiring some Paris fashion photographer for six grand like climate Barbie did they just brought their own campaign photographer with them jetting in all the way from BC but you'd have to spend some time digging to see what this ministerial assistant really did she was just a photographer she's not there to save the world she's there to do propaganda which is what all of them are there to do that's an excerpt from my daily TV show the yeas relevant show normally it's behind a paywall but I thought you'd like this video so we put it on YouTube if you want to subscribe to watch the daily show every day including always two interviews today and I read my hate mail just click on this screen and become a Premium Member you
