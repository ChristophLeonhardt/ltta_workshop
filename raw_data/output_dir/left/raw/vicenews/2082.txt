1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,760
every two minutes a woman is raped or

2
00:00:02,760 --> 00:00:05,150
sexually assaulted in America every

3
00:00:05,150 --> 00:00:08,880
person in this country has probably been

4
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:19,380
affected by it in some capacity hi I'm

5
00:00:19,380 --> 00:00:21,359
Liz fields I'm an editor here at vice

6
00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:23,550
news and I'm going to be speaking it

7
00:00:23,550 --> 00:00:28,320
today about a publish piece that focuses

8
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:30,779
on America's sexual assault kit backlog

9
00:00:30,779 --> 00:00:32,668
I really look forward to<font color="#CCCCCC"> receiving your</font>

10
00:00:32,668 --> 00:00:35,430
questions today it was thanks for coming

11
00:00:35,430 --> 00:00:37,469
on the show we've got a great group<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

12
00:00:37,469 --> 00:00:39,270
people who want to talk to you and first

13
00:00:39,270 --> 00:00:42,530
one is<font color="#CCCCCC"> leora so let's say</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> hi to the ER</font>

14
00:00:42,530 --> 00:00:46,079
meliora it<font color="#CCCCCC"> Liz how are you and well how</font>

15
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:49,110
are<font color="#E5E5E5"> you great thanks so I mean there's</font>

16
00:00:49,110 --> 00:00:53,160
so much widespread dismissal of the

17
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:56,039
claims of rape victims because<font color="#CCCCCC"> of this</font>

18
00:00:56,039 --> 00:00:58,559
larger culture of slut-shaming that we

19
00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:01,230
all exist in and reading your excellent

20
00:01:01,230 --> 00:01:03,629
piece you know I was reading it through

21
00:01:03,629 --> 00:01:05,790
this lens of the culture of slut-shaming

22
00:01:05,790 --> 00:01:09,900
and so my question to you is do you see

23
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:12,750
a connection you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know between this</font>

24
00:01:12,750 --> 00:01:14,610
mindset and we've seen<font color="#E5E5E5"> that in your</font>

25
00:01:14,610 --> 00:01:16,650
reporting on the part of law enforcement

26
00:01:16,650 --> 00:01:18,540
that they don't need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to take</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> these</font>

27
00:01:18,540 --> 00:01:20,820
claims seriously is there a<font color="#CCCCCC"> connection</font>

28
00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:23,220
between<font color="#E5E5E5"> that mindset and the existence</font>

29
00:01:23,220 --> 00:01:26,009
of this backlog that's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> great question</font>

30
00:01:26,009 --> 00:01:30,000
and in<font color="#CCCCCC"> my mind I think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> there is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a direct</font>

31
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,240
correlation<font color="#E5E5E5"> between the backlog of</font>

32
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:37,049
untested rape kits and this tendency to

33
00:01:37,049 --> 00:01:39,509
disbelieve will reject survivors claims

34
00:01:39,509 --> 00:01:42,450
of sexual assault when I<font color="#E5E5E5"> talked to Wendy</font>

35
00:01:42,450 --> 00:01:46,189
who is a survivor<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the story she</font>

36
00:01:46,189 --> 00:01:48,750
overwhelmingly had positive things to

37
00:01:48,750 --> 00:01:50,460
say about the way that the lake chels

38
00:01:50,460 --> 00:01:52,049
<font color="#CCCCCC">police department had handled her case</font>

39
00:01:52,049 --> 00:01:54,240
but she did mention a couple of

40
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:56,689
instances where she had received

41
00:01:56,689 --> 00:01:59,420
skepticism and disbelief on her behalf

42
00:01:59,420 --> 00:02:02,520
and one of those instances actually

43
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:04,500
happened right after she had gone

44
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:07,350
undergone this horrendous sort of very

45
00:02:07,350 --> 00:02:11,230
invasive hours-long rape kit exam

46
00:02:11,230 --> 00:02:13,750
and the responding officer came up to

47
00:02:13,750 --> 00:02:15,879
her<font color="#CCCCCC"> and said are you sure</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this isn't</font>

48
00:02:15,879 --> 00:02:18,549
<font color="#CCCCCC">just a rape deal I mean sorry</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a drug</font>

49
00:02:18,549 --> 00:02:23,769
deal gone bad and well so what I mean

50
00:02:23,769 --> 00:02:26,950
<font color="#CCCCCC">even if it was and it wasn't there is no</font>

51
00:02:26,950 --> 00:02:30,459
way that we can<font color="#E5E5E5"> correlate bombing a drug</font>

52
00:02:30,459 --> 00:02:32,470
deal gone bad with her claims of sexual

53
00:02:32,470 --> 00:02:35,440
assault and one of the other<font color="#CCCCCC"> things that</font>

54
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:37,540
I came<font color="#CCCCCC"> across in my research which was</font>

55
00:02:37,540 --> 00:02:39,129
very disturbing was that about

56
00:02:39,129 --> 00:02:42,579
eighty-six percent of sexual assault

57
00:02:42,579 --> 00:02:44,920
claims never make it past the police

58
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:49,390
reporting level and so that means that

59
00:02:49,390 --> 00:02:52,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">those cases never make it to prosecutors</font>

60
00:02:52,390 --> 00:02:56,019
and cases are shut and evidence shelved

61
00:02:56,019 --> 00:03:00,069
those rape kits never get tested so<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

62
00:03:00,069 --> 00:03:02,650
is an inherent problem that needs to be

63
00:03:02,650 --> 00:03:05,769
fixed but at the same time I<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't think</font>

64
00:03:05,769 --> 00:03:09,790
we can just put<font color="#CCCCCC"> that on to police and</font>

65
00:03:09,790 --> 00:03:12,269
law enforcement it's a<font color="#CCCCCC"> systemic thing</font>

66
00:03:12,269 --> 00:03:14,950
that affects all echelons of society

67
00:03:14,950 --> 00:03:19,000
from law enforcement to prosecution to

68
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:25,079
lawmakers and even everyday families

69
00:03:25,079 --> 00:03:27,970
colleagues and everyone else in society

70
00:03:27,970 --> 00:03:31,299
that do sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of have a tendency to</font>

71
00:03:31,299 --> 00:03:36,669
reject this the stories<font color="#CCCCCC"> of survivors and</font>

72
00:03:36,669 --> 00:03:38,650
it's something<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we need</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> address</font>

73
00:03:38,650 --> 00:03:41,680
as a society as well oh yeah absolutely

74
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:45,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">and I I create that it goes so much</font>

75
00:03:45,730 --> 00:03:47,230
larger and not to isolate law

76
00:03:47,230 --> 00:03:50,950
enforcement I just I'm pulling out an

77
00:03:50,950 --> 00:03:54,280
excerpt<font color="#E5E5E5"> from your article about how</font>

78
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:56,590
investigators said that<font color="#E5E5E5"> since she</font>

79
00:03:56,590 --> 00:03:58,389
couldn't recall the masked man's face

80
00:03:58,389 --> 00:04:00,400
<font color="#CCCCCC">and then one officer suggested she might</font>

81
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:02,590
be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to recognize his penis if she</font>

82
00:04:02,590 --> 00:04:05,139
saw<font color="#E5E5E5"> it again and that this elicited</font>

83
00:04:05,139 --> 00:04:07,930
laughter from others which of course is

84
00:04:07,930 --> 00:04:11,319
just such a horrifying<font color="#CCCCCC"> experience that</font>

85
00:04:11,319 --> 00:04:12,989
<font color="#E5E5E5">this young woman had to go through to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font>

86
00:04:12,989 --> 00:04:17,139
shamed in such a horrible<font color="#CCCCCC"> manner after</font>

87
00:04:17,139 --> 00:04:20,950
she had already been victimized and you

88
00:04:20,950 --> 00:04:22,510
know that really<font color="#E5E5E5"> just drove home</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

89
00:04:22,510 --> 00:04:24,230
point that

90
00:04:24,230 --> 00:04:26,930
many members<font color="#CCCCCC"> of law enforcement don't</font>

91
00:04:26,930 --> 00:04:30,500
have the training to recognize<font color="#E5E5E5"> that rape</font>

92
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:35,210
is is a crime like basic basic fact and

93
00:04:35,210 --> 00:04:36,830
yet certainly<font color="#E5E5E5"> in this case they really</font>

94
00:04:36,830 --> 00:04:40,220
bungled it big time so and I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

95
00:04:40,220 --> 00:04:42,850
you you know explored that really well

96
00:04:42,850 --> 00:04:46,550
well thanks but you know I the

97
00:04:46,550 --> 00:04:48,020
disturbing thing is that was a horrific

98
00:04:48,020 --> 00:04:50,750
moment especially as this just happened

99
00:04:50,750 --> 00:04:53,720
right after the trauma and you know as

100
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:56,840
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know memory is not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> forgiving of</font>

101
00:04:56,840 --> 00:04:59,360
trauma and so a lot of the time when

102
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:01,310
survivors can't immediately recall

103
00:05:01,310 --> 00:05:03,920
certain events or their stories change

104
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:06,380
when they remember new events it's often

105
00:05:06,380 --> 00:05:09,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">seen by police as a lack of cooperation</font>

106
00:05:09,890 --> 00:05:15,440
and that can<font color="#CCCCCC"> be changed</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> through police</font>

107
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:17,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">training and when I spoke</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to dr.</font>

108
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:20,390
Kimberly<font color="#E5E5E5"> Long's way who works for the</font>

109
00:05:20,390 --> 00:05:22,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">end violence against women international</font>

110
00:05:22,580 --> 00:05:25,970
which trains police<font color="#E5E5E5"> specifically and how</font>

111
00:05:25,970 --> 00:05:27,010
to deal with sexual assault

112
00:05:27,010 --> 00:05:31,600
investigations she revealed to me that

113
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:34,360
police have very little if at all

114
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:37,000
training and sexual assault

115
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:40,370
investigations which<font color="#E5E5E5"> something that you</font>

116
00:05:40,370 --> 00:05:43,340
know is is shocking because it so many

117
00:05:43,340 --> 00:05:46,400
of these happen every day you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know every</font>

118
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:48,740
two minutes a woman is raped or sexually

119
00:05:48,740 --> 00:05:53,470
assaulted in America and that's a lot of

120
00:05:53,470 --> 00:05:58,310
like but well not all of them<font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font>

121
00:05:58,310 --> 00:06:02,510
actually reported so even if we discount

122
00:06:02,510 --> 00:06:05,360
those and then we get<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the point where</font>

123
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:07,280
the women are actually tested in

124
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:10,970
hospital after that there's a whole

125
00:06:10,970 --> 00:06:13,670
bunch<font color="#E5E5E5"> of like thousands of these kids</font>

126
00:06:13,670 --> 00:06:15,140
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> just sit on the shelves because</font>

127
00:06:15,140 --> 00:06:17,200
ultimately it is up to the police and

128
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:19,910
their discretion to push the case

129
00:06:19,910 --> 00:06:24,740
forward yeah which actually protects

130
00:06:24,740 --> 00:06:28,790
rapists right because you know aid the

131
00:06:28,790 --> 00:06:31,700
rapist is free to go and see really<font color="#E5E5E5"> rape</font>

132
00:06:31,700 --> 00:06:35,510
others and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> women know about this</font>

133
00:06:35,510 --> 00:06:37,340
backlog they know about the existence of

134
00:06:37,340 --> 00:06:37,880
the back

135
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:40,010
and then knowing that knowledge becomes

136
00:06:40,010 --> 00:06:42,190
a deterrent<font color="#CCCCCC"> to want to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> come forward</font>

137
00:06:42,190 --> 00:06:45,920
themselves so it<font color="#E5E5E5"> just perpetuates itself</font>

138
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:49,430
and and you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know as I say and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> as you say</font>

139
00:06:49,430 --> 00:06:51,350
as well this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> very much connected with</font>

140
00:06:51,350 --> 00:06:54,890
this larger cultural problem if I may

141
00:06:54,890 --> 00:06:58,850
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> another question which is I know</font>

142
00:06:58,850 --> 00:07:01,190
you discuss both sides of the issue<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

143
00:07:01,190 --> 00:07:03,440
the article about whether after a

144
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:07,160
certain you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know lapse of time has</font>

145
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:09,860
occurred whether or not the victim

146
00:07:09,860 --> 00:07:12,140
should be given a choice to test the kid

147
00:07:12,140 --> 00:07:14,870
<font color="#CCCCCC">after you know after finally the backlog</font>

148
00:07:14,870 --> 00:07:17,660
is addressed after however many<font color="#CCCCCC"> X years</font>

149
00:07:17,660 --> 00:07:19,550
and you know you gave the case<font color="#E5E5E5"> of 20</font>

150
00:07:19,550 --> 00:07:22,070
<font color="#CCCCCC">years which is you know really just</font>

151
00:07:22,070 --> 00:07:24,050
unbelievable but you know should<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

152
00:07:24,050 --> 00:07:25,670
victim be given a choice<font color="#E5E5E5"> you give both</font>

153
00:07:25,670 --> 00:07:28,840
both sides i'm wondering what you think

154
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:32,660
well you know I it is an extremely

155
00:07:32,660 --> 00:07:34,660
difficult issue that one that

156
00:07:34,660 --> 00:07:36,620
authorities and law enforcement are

157
00:07:36,620 --> 00:07:39,070
working through right now I'm a when

158
00:07:39,070 --> 00:07:43,820
Wendy got her test<font color="#CCCCCC"> 20 years later she</font>

159
00:07:43,820 --> 00:07:46,070
was not happy to get that she fell to

160
00:07:46,070 --> 00:07:48,860
her knees was wailing like and her

161
00:07:48,860 --> 00:07:50,180
colleagues had never seen her before

162
00:07:50,180 --> 00:07:53,300
like that<font color="#CCCCCC"> and she was she told me at</font>

163
00:07:53,300 --> 00:07:55,310
that point<font color="#E5E5E5"> she was at one</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of the best</font>

164
00:07:55,310 --> 00:07:56,990
places<font color="#E5E5E5"> in her life she was running half</font>

165
00:07:56,990 --> 00:08:01,640
marathons chasing after kids and for

166
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:04,250
other women I had a<font color="#E5E5E5"> survivor tweet at me</font>

167
00:08:04,250 --> 00:08:06,110
last night that it was like rubbing salt

168
00:08:06,110 --> 00:08:09,440
in the wound and so for those women you

169
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:12,950
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> we can't reject that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> they're their</font>

170
00:08:12,950 --> 00:08:17,000
personal wishes to not have the kids

171
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,190
tested but on the other<font color="#E5E5E5"> hand as the</font>

172
00:08:19,190 --> 00:08:21,530
argument that<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you do test all kids</font>

173
00:08:21,530 --> 00:08:24,220
that there is a chance that you can get

174
00:08:24,220 --> 00:08:27,410
serial rapists off the street who often

175
00:08:27,410 --> 00:08:29,540
across state borders and everything else

176
00:08:29,540 --> 00:08:32,500
but I think this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> one of the very</font>

177
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:36,169
crucial issues that task forces and law

178
00:08:36,169 --> 00:08:37,789
enforcement are working towards

179
00:08:37,789 --> 00:08:39,890
resolving and there's still no<font color="#CCCCCC"> finite</font>

180
00:08:39,890 --> 00:08:44,150
answers to that I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think one of the</font>

181
00:08:44,150 --> 00:08:48,650
things that<font color="#E5E5E5"> they can do what Houston did</font>

182
00:08:48,650 --> 00:08:50,670
was actually send out a

183
00:08:50,670 --> 00:08:53,370
PSA announcement to all the women out

184
00:08:53,370 --> 00:08:57,630
there and said we're testing all these

185
00:08:57,630 --> 00:08:59,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">kids were finally clearing our backlog</font>

186
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:04,080
and you can choose to<font color="#E5E5E5"> come forward or</font>

187
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:06,660
<font color="#CCCCCC">not and that's one way of doing it but</font>

188
00:09:06,660 --> 00:09:09,390
<font color="#CCCCCC">so far this is a relatively new thing</font>

189
00:09:09,390 --> 00:09:11,760
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know that these backlogs are</font>

190
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:13,530
actually starting to get tested<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

191
00:09:13,530 --> 00:09:16,560
there's still such a long way to go but

192
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:19,140
these these issues will keep arising and

193
00:09:19,140 --> 00:09:22,080
to keep the discussion going is what's

194
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:25,890
important thank you so much less thank

195
00:09:25,890 --> 00:09:28,170
you for exposing this issue thank you

196
00:09:28,170 --> 00:09:30,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> coming on and asking some great</font>

questions yeah thanks<font color="#CCCCCC"> Sarah so Liz we</font>

198
00:09:33,780 --> 00:09:35,610

this morning I'm from<font color="#E5E5E5"> Oregon I want you</font>

201
00:09:40,770 --> 00:09:43,370
<font color="#CCCCCC">San Francisco and i would like to ask</font>

202
00:09:43,370 --> 00:09:46,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">for this on the line is that when it</font>

203
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:49,310
<font color="#CCCCCC">comes to the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> break the rape kit test is</font>

204
00:09:49,310 --> 00:09:52,980
there like I guess waiting list<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get</font>

205
00:09:52,980 --> 00:09:55,950
it actually tested like you know how

206
00:09:55,950 --> 00:09:57,570
there's an<font color="#CCCCCC"> organ donor</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> list is the same</font>

207
00:09:57,570 --> 00:09:59,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">thing like that and how would</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a woman</font>

208
00:09:59,550 --> 00:10:04,020
get kind of bumped up on this list if it

209
00:10:04,020 --> 00:10:07,110
is but uh you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know that's what I like to</font>

210
00:10:07,110 --> 00:10:09,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">know this week on on the line so thanks</font>

211
00:10:09,410 --> 00:10:12,480
that's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> great question Morgan and in</font>

212
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:16,080
short I would say no there is not a

213
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:20,730
waiting list the accrual of untested

214
00:10:20,730 --> 00:10:22,740
rape kits has been happening<font color="#CCCCCC"> over</font>

215
00:10:22,740 --> 00:10:27,210
decades and what is happening now<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

216
00:10:27,210 --> 00:10:29,190
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> finally we're starting to get</font>

217
00:10:29,190 --> 00:10:33,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">funding to test that backlog but it's</font>

218
00:10:33,150 --> 00:10:36,930
also inevitably as I mentioned before up

219
00:10:36,930 --> 00:10:41,070
to investigators to decide whether these

220
00:10:41,070 --> 00:10:43,140
kits will be tested and there there<font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font>

221
00:10:43,140 --> 00:10:45,990
a number of reasons why they don't think

222
00:10:45,990 --> 00:10:48,150
they can sort of push it forward to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

223
00:10:48,150 --> 00:10:50,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">prosecutor prosecution level because</font>

224
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:55,020
either of a lack of supporting evidence

225
00:10:55,020 --> 00:10:58,580
in other areas or whatnot so

226
00:10:58,580 --> 00:11:02,580
unfortunately you kind of sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of get</font>

227
00:11:02,580 --> 00:11:04,300
pushed to the front of

228
00:11:04,300 --> 00:11:09,820
kind of line but as more funding comes

229
00:11:09,820 --> 00:11:12,430
through we're hoping<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you know more</font>

230
00:11:12,430 --> 00:11:15,240
kids will be tested in different cities

231
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:20,020
so it's just a<font color="#E5E5E5"> matter of keeping and</font>

232
00:11:20,020 --> 00:11:22,230
getting survivors stories out there and

233
00:11:22,230 --> 00:11:25,110
putting this issue in the spotlight

234
00:11:25,110 --> 00:11:27,970
great so you know with<font color="#CCCCCC"> that let's say it</font>

235
00:11:27,970 --> 00:11:30,240
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> Danny i was calling</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> us on skype and</font>

236
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:35,590
your shoes Danny hi hi I really enjoyed

237
00:11:35,590 --> 00:11:38,440
<font color="#CCCCCC">your article and I could relate to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it to</font>

238
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:41,740
some extent my perpetrator was sentenced

239
00:11:41,740 --> 00:11:44,590
to jail for child sexual abuse on me

240
00:11:44,590 --> 00:11:46,750
that had happened 30 years ago so it<font color="#E5E5E5"> was</font>

241
00:11:46,750 --> 00:11:50,170
a case of later in life prosecution and

242
00:11:50,170 --> 00:11:53,800
um kind of resurrecting the crime and

243
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:55,810
all that came with it after several

244
00:11:55,810 --> 00:11:58,690
decades and my<font color="#CCCCCC"> experience with the</font>

245
00:11:58,690 --> 00:12:01,300
police department was astoundingly

246
00:12:01,300 --> 00:12:03,490
positive same goes for the<font color="#E5E5E5"> state's</font>

247
00:12:03,490 --> 00:12:05,410
attorney but one piece that was missing

248
00:12:05,410 --> 00:12:07,810
for me even<font color="#CCCCCC"> as a mental health counselor</font>

249
00:12:07,810 --> 00:12:10,390
was it I was not prepared for the

250
00:12:10,390 --> 00:12:12,250
emotional fallout associated with

251
00:12:12,250 --> 00:12:15,250
addressing these past crimes I thought I

252
00:12:15,250 --> 00:12:17,410
would<font color="#CCCCCC"> feel primarily relieved and happy</font>

253
00:12:17,410 --> 00:12:20,320
to have dealt<font color="#E5E5E5"> with it and instead it</font>

254
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:22,510
sent me into a tailspin so with mere

255
00:12:22,510 --> 00:12:24,310
speaking earlier about you know blendy

256
00:12:24,310 --> 00:12:27,130
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm sure this is common for a lot of</font>

257
00:12:27,130 --> 00:12:28,690
<font color="#CCCCCC">victims oh my goodness do I even want</font>

258
00:12:28,690 --> 00:12:31,840
this tested or in the case of a rape kit

259
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:34,660
I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> wondering about the mental health</font>

260
00:12:34,660 --> 00:12:36,370
angle I mean where it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not a binary oh</font>

261
00:12:36,370 --> 00:12:38,650
this is too upsetting so you can't do it

262
00:12:38,650 --> 00:12:42,190
our municipalities who are digging up

263
00:12:42,190 --> 00:12:44,650
these old crimes open to exploring the

264
00:12:44,650 --> 00:12:46,660
options of counseling and a different

265
00:12:46,660 --> 00:12:48,970
level of victim advocacy for people who

266
00:12:48,970 --> 00:12:51,370
experience crimes a long time ago mmhmm

267
00:12:51,370 --> 00:12:53,800
yeah you're absolutely right and that

268
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:55,450
does need to be a holistic<font color="#CCCCCC"> approach to</font>

269
00:12:55,450 --> 00:13:00,460
this and and one angle that law

270
00:13:00,460 --> 00:13:01,750
enforcement authorities have been

271
00:13:01,750 --> 00:13:05,290
pursuing is this victim-centered

272
00:13:05,290 --> 00:13:07,180
approach which means that<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're</font>

273
00:13:07,180 --> 00:13:09,370
helping like<font color="#E5E5E5"> in that in the case</font>

274
00:13:09,370 --> 00:13:11,560
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> Houston they brought in a special</font>

275
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:15,850
victims advocate to sort of hold their

276
00:13:15,850 --> 00:13:17,200
hand as they will through the whole

277
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:18,910
process that<font color="#CCCCCC"> they had someone that they</font>

278
00:13:18,910 --> 00:13:22,060
could rely<font color="#CCCCCC"> on and to speak with and and</font>

279
00:13:22,060 --> 00:13:25,510
seek other counseling services if they

280
00:13:25,510 --> 00:13:27,339
<font color="#E5E5E5">needed to because it is so intimidating</font>

281
00:13:27,339 --> 00:13:30,220
to go into<font color="#E5E5E5"> a police office I mean a</font>

282
00:13:30,220 --> 00:13:32,290
police department full of male offices

283
00:13:32,290 --> 00:13:34,060
and explain<font color="#CCCCCC"> to you exactly what happened</font>

284
00:13:34,060 --> 00:13:37,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">to there are also some great programs</font>

285
00:13:37,650 --> 00:13:40,570
like the same<font color="#E5E5E5"> nurse's program the sexual</font>

286
00:13:40,570 --> 00:13:43,240
assault<font color="#CCCCCC"> nurse examiners and they go</font>

287
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:44,830
through the whole process with you as

288
00:13:44,830 --> 00:13:47,020
well they need to be definitely more

289
00:13:47,020 --> 00:13:49,620
programs but there are some sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

290
00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:53,050
assistance like programs being provided

291
00:13:53,050 --> 00:13:56,140
at the moment I mean I and I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to ask</font>

292
00:13:56,140 --> 00:13:57,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">you more on that front like your</font>

293
00:13:57,940 --> 00:14:01,450
experience in and how you went through

294
00:14:01,450 --> 00:14:05,730
that and and what time this was actually

295
00:14:05,730 --> 00:14:09,160
yeah I just<font color="#E5E5E5"> I realized it goes it was</font>

296
00:14:09,160 --> 00:14:10,720
two years ago this summer that I had

297
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:13,510
been abused as a child and your article

298
00:14:13,510 --> 00:14:15,190
really resonated with<font color="#CCCCCC"> me because even</font>

299
00:14:15,190 --> 00:14:17,740
though there wasn't a rape kit I knew

300
00:14:17,740 --> 00:14:19,120
the crime had happened I knew my

301
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:21,310
perpetrator was out there and it was a

302
00:14:21,310 --> 00:14:23,770
question of finding evidence so in my

303
00:14:23,770 --> 00:14:25,510
case I went to the Montgomery<font color="#CCCCCC"> County</font>

304
00:14:25,510 --> 00:14:28,150
Maryland police department I had a

305
00:14:28,150 --> 00:14:30,400
wonderful detective there was a victim

306
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:32,620
advocate there for me as well and I

307
00:14:32,620 --> 00:14:35,440
reported<font color="#CCCCCC"> the crime and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I did not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font>

308
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:38,589
any linear memory of it as you addressed

309
00:14:38,589 --> 00:14:41,500
in your article just traumatic memories

310
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:43,630
aren't stored the same way as regular

311
00:14:43,630 --> 00:14:46,330
memories um so we did a phone sting and

312
00:14:46,330 --> 00:14:48,220
he confessed so that was the equivalent

313
00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:49,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">I was kind of like my rape kit where we</font>

314
00:14:49,930 --> 00:14:52,510
had definitive evidence that<font color="#E5E5E5"> my</font>

315
00:14:52,510 --> 00:14:55,420
perpetrator had indeed committed these

316
00:14:55,420 --> 00:14:58,870
crimes and<font color="#E5E5E5"> um I mean overall it was a</font>

317
00:14:58,870 --> 00:15:01,480
very positive experience but I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think the</font>

318
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:03,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">fact that I present as a very competent</font>

319
00:15:03,310 --> 00:15:06,760
high functioning adult kind of put<font color="#CCCCCC"> me in</font>

320
00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:09,160
a position where I didn't feel<font color="#CCCCCC"> like I</font>

321
00:15:09,160 --> 00:15:10,839
needed to avail myself of certain

322
00:15:10,839 --> 00:15:12,720
resources and they weren't necessarily

323
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:15,510
presented to me because I came in as a

324
00:15:15,510 --> 00:15:18,010
you know I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> I was 36 when I</font>

325
00:15:18,010 --> 00:15:20,230
reported it I didn't but I felt like<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

326
00:15:20,230 --> 00:15:22,040
was eight so that was the

327
00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:24,199
the issue<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I experienced in terms of</font>

328
00:15:24,199 --> 00:15:27,050
the delayed reporting and quest for

329
00:15:27,050 --> 00:15:29,990
justice mm-hmm and that's something I

330
00:15:29,990 --> 00:15:31,759
think<font color="#CCCCCC"> I tried to dress a little bit in</font>

331
00:15:31,759 --> 00:15:34,190
the article is that every survivors

332
00:15:34,190 --> 00:15:36,589
experience is so different and so unique

333
00:15:36,589 --> 00:15:41,360
and your mind from when it happened to

334
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:43,100
the point where you might end up

335
00:15:43,100 --> 00:15:45,740
prosecuting it will change like and

336
00:15:45,740 --> 00:15:47,600
emotional it's like a roller coaster

337
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:51,170
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> up and down and so it's difficult</font>

338
00:15:51,170 --> 00:15:54,680
at that time to get the exact kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

339
00:15:54,680 --> 00:15:57,980
help that you always need and and there

340
00:15:57,980 --> 00:16:00,139
are other people's assumptions I guess

341
00:16:00,139 --> 00:16:02,509
on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the way you should behave in the way</font>

342
00:16:02,509 --> 00:16:06,470
you should act which dictate how people

343
00:16:06,470 --> 00:16:10,160
respond to<font color="#E5E5E5"> you so all I can say is I</font>

344
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:11,779
think the more education the more voices

345
00:16:11,779 --> 00:16:15,079
we able<font color="#CCCCCC"> to get out there</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on this issue</font>

346
00:16:15,079 --> 00:16:17,600
can make people<font color="#E5E5E5"> more understand better</font>

347
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:20,709
exactly what survivors are going through

348
00:16:20,709 --> 00:16:23,060
yeah I completely agree i think there's

349
00:16:23,060 --> 00:16:25,040
definitely a piece of just awareness and

350
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:27,110
some people just don't understand and

351
00:16:27,110 --> 00:16:28,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">they assume it would be all positive or</font>

352
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:31,279
an adult always can access adult skills

353
00:16:31,279 --> 00:16:33,319
and coping mechanisms and in the case of

354
00:16:33,319 --> 00:16:35,810
trauma that's not always true so<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

355
00:16:35,810 --> 00:16:37,339
definitely agree that awareness and

356
00:16:37,339 --> 00:16:39,829
conversation and dialogue about sexual

357
00:16:39,829 --> 00:16:41,630
assault<font color="#E5E5E5"> and sexual abuse even though</font>

358
00:16:41,630 --> 00:16:43,130
it's so highly stigmatized is an

359
00:16:43,130 --> 00:16:47,360
important component anything else you

360
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:50,060

well first of all I wanted to thank<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

369
00:17:14,599 --> 00:17:19,400
<font color="#CCCCCC">for writing this piece I really really</font>

370
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:22,309
enjoyed how cognizant you were and like

371
00:17:22,309 --> 00:17:24,069
how<font color="#E5E5E5"> you were very intentional about</font>

372
00:17:24,069 --> 00:17:27,049
expressing how hard it is to go through

373
00:17:27,049 --> 00:17:30,020
the you know the<font color="#CCCCCC"> the rape kits and</font>

374
00:17:30,020 --> 00:17:32,720
trying to you know using<font color="#E5E5E5"> the criminal</font>

375
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:35,450
system to try and<font color="#E5E5E5"> get justice I think I</font>

376
00:17:35,450 --> 00:17:35,900
was

377
00:17:35,900 --> 00:17:37,880
really you know I connected with that

378
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:39,440
really well even<font color="#CCCCCC"> though I've never</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> gone</font>

379
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:43,880
through<font color="#E5E5E5"> that process so I personally I'm</font>

380
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:46,550
an activist and I do a lot of stuff

381
00:17:46,550 --> 00:17:49,180
around representation so it was really

382
00:17:49,180 --> 00:17:52,370
interested in hearing about the journey

383
00:17:52,370 --> 00:17:54,470
towards like finding the survivors and

384
00:17:54,470 --> 00:17:56,900
like how<font color="#CCCCCC"> many did you speak to what made</font>

385
00:17:56,900 --> 00:17:58,970
you decide to pick the two that were<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

386
00:17:58,970 --> 00:18:06,230
the Peace well on the record i spoke to

387
00:18:06,230 --> 00:18:10,280
five survivors off the record i spoke to

388
00:18:10,280 --> 00:18:13,160
dozens<font color="#CCCCCC"> i would have to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> say and this is a</font>

389
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:16,460
an issue i've been looking not only for

390
00:18:16,460 --> 00:18:17,950
the last few<font color="#CCCCCC"> months when</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i've actually</font>

391
00:18:17,950 --> 00:18:21,110
physically been writing it but for many

392
00:18:21,110 --> 00:18:24,650
years because as<font color="#E5E5E5"> i might have mentioned</font>

393
00:18:24,650 --> 00:18:28,160
before every two minutes a woman is

394
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:33,190
raped in this country so that there's no

395
00:18:33,190 --> 00:18:39,140
way you know every every person in this

396
00:18:39,140 --> 00:18:41,750
country has probably been affected by it

397
00:18:41,750 --> 00:18:44,060
in some capacity you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> I have close</font>

398
00:18:44,060 --> 00:18:45,860
friends and<font color="#CCCCCC"> family who have been</font>

399
00:18:45,860 --> 00:18:49,130
sexually abused produces in this room

400
00:18:49,130 --> 00:18:51,500
people<font color="#CCCCCC"> in the city people in this</font>

401
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:53,810
country<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know it affects everyone and</font>

402
00:18:53,810 --> 00:19:00,260
so I<font color="#E5E5E5"> guess choosing the survivor to</font>

403
00:19:00,260 --> 00:19:05,110
actually be in the piece was a matter of

404
00:19:05,110 --> 00:19:07,760
journalistically it came from a point of

405
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:08,930
view where I wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to speak with</font>

406
00:19:08,930 --> 00:19:10,910
someone who had recently gone through it

407
00:19:10,910 --> 00:19:12,320
who had actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> gone through the</font>

408
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:14,750
beginning and right to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> end of the</font>

409
00:19:14,750 --> 00:19:18,200
court case and I met Wendy I spoke<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

410
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:19,970
her over the first time a couple<font color="#E5E5E5"> of days</font>

411
00:19:19,970 --> 00:19:26,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">after her attacker had just pled guilty</font>

412
00:19:26,300 --> 00:19:29,750
in court and so<font color="#CCCCCC"> that was still a very</font>

413
00:19:29,750 --> 00:19:32,090
raw and emotional time for her and

414
00:19:32,090 --> 00:19:35,930
<font color="#CCCCCC">getting to know her and and being able</font>

415
00:19:35,930 --> 00:19:38,150
to speak with her about that

416
00:19:38,150 --> 00:19:42,500
she seemed like she was<font color="#E5E5E5"> finally ready to</font>

417
00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:45,050
open up because<font color="#E5E5E5"> for 22 years she was</font>

418
00:19:45,050 --> 00:19:47,390
physically not able to say<font color="#CCCCCC"> the words I</font>

419
00:19:47,390 --> 00:19:50,540
was raped and that is something I feel

420
00:19:50,540 --> 00:19:53,000
like a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of survivors I've spoken to</font>

421
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,070
have have gone through<font color="#E5E5E5"> that very same</font>

422
00:19:55,070 --> 00:19:59,420
experience and and while what I tried to

423
00:19:59,420 --> 00:20:01,010
highlight was that no survivors

424
00:20:01,010 --> 00:20:03,860
experiences universal at all there were

425
00:20:03,860 --> 00:20:06,550
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of points that she made that</font>

426
00:20:06,550 --> 00:20:10,910
directly related to issues of like

427
00:20:10,910 --> 00:20:14,480
police and the prosecution and

428
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:16,940
everything else she was sort of able to

429
00:20:16,940 --> 00:20:20,570
guide the narrative through that that's

430
00:20:20,570 --> 00:20:23,750
great so related to that<font color="#E5E5E5"> as well I</font>

431
00:20:23,750 --> 00:20:25,400
noticed you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know those pictures of the</font>

432
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:28,070
survivors and the pieces and I noticed

433
00:20:28,070 --> 00:20:29,510
that they<font color="#E5E5E5"> both looked white I don't know</font>

434
00:20:29,510 --> 00:20:31,880
if they<font color="#CCCCCC"> are not but I was really curious</font>

435
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:34,220
to think about like was it<font color="#E5E5E5"> hard to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> find</font>

436
00:20:34,220 --> 00:20:36,590
racial diversity amongst the survivors

437
00:20:36,590 --> 00:20:39,710
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you were speaking to and do you</font>

438
00:20:39,710 --> 00:20:41,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">think it's related to sort of the focus</font>

439
00:20:41,930 --> 00:20:43,610
on the piece just thinking about<font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font>

440
00:20:43,610 --> 00:20:45,470
using<font color="#E5E5E5"> the courts use justice if we're</font>

441
00:20:45,470 --> 00:20:48,110
thinking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about how you know many people</font>

442
00:20:48,110 --> 00:20:49,940
from communities of color don't feel

443
00:20:49,940 --> 00:20:52,940
comfortable going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the police or using</font>

444
00:20:52,940 --> 00:20:54,470
the courts to find any<font color="#CCCCCC"> sort of justice</font>

445
00:20:54,470 --> 00:20:55,580
just you know thinking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font>

446
00:20:55,580 --> 00:20:57,370
historically and even just very recently

447
00:20:57,370 --> 00:21:00,080
thinking about that like very tense

448
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:02,930
relationship between you know the police

449
00:21:02,930 --> 00:21:06,830
and people of color yeah I mean that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

450
00:21:06,830 --> 00:21:09,560
great question I definitely<font color="#E5E5E5"> did not have</font>

451
00:21:09,560 --> 00:21:11,510
any trouble finding women of different

452
00:21:11,510 --> 00:21:13,460
color who had gone through this

453
00:21:13,460 --> 00:21:16,370
experience women of every color creed

454
00:21:16,370 --> 00:21:18,550
race all around the world have

455
00:21:18,550 --> 00:21:23,540
experienced this very same issue as I

456
00:21:23,540 --> 00:21:25,190
said before I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> was more than</font>

457
00:21:25,190 --> 00:21:28,940
narrative arc that I chose to involve

458
00:21:28,940 --> 00:21:34,940
Wendy and Natasha as well but I<font color="#E5E5E5"> mean on</font>

459
00:21:34,940 --> 00:21:38,030
that I would love<font color="#CCCCCC"> to hear from you and</font>

460
00:21:38,030 --> 00:21:40,850
your experiences because I I think you

461
00:21:40,850 --> 00:21:43,340
would know probably better than I about

462
00:21:43,340 --> 00:21:46,670
the issues that sort of women of

463
00:21:46,670 --> 00:21:47,290
different

464
00:21:47,290 --> 00:21:49,030
the city's kind of facing the legal

465
00:21:49,030 --> 00:21:52,450
justice system so tell me a bit about

466
00:21:52,450 --> 00:21:58,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">that yeah I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> mean I tried very briefly</font>

467
00:21:58,510 --> 00:22:00,490
you know I was sexually<font color="#E5E5E5"> assaulted when I</font>

468
00:22:00,490 --> 00:22:04,060
was in college and I i I'd to report it

469
00:22:04,060 --> 00:22:05,740
to the police at school and they were

470
00:22:05,740 --> 00:22:08,740
very<font color="#E5E5E5"> resistant there was luckily one</font>

471
00:22:08,740 --> 00:22:10,660
officer there and she<font color="#E5E5E5"> was great but the</font>

472
00:22:10,660 --> 00:22:13,300
<font color="#CCCCCC">Chief of Police really wasn't having it</font>

473
00:22:13,300 --> 00:22:16,030
you know called me<font color="#CCCCCC"> crazy like befriended</font>

474
00:22:16,030 --> 00:22:19,210
my rapist just these sort of things and

475
00:22:19,210 --> 00:22:23,320
just you know as a<font color="#E5E5E5"> person who is who's</font>

476
00:22:23,320 --> 00:22:25,330
black in America<font color="#E5E5E5"> and just knowing about</font>

477
00:22:25,330 --> 00:22:26,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">that relationship between police and</font>

478
00:22:26,860 --> 00:22:29,440
like the court systems and knowing that

479
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:31,570
like finding justice just isn't as

480
00:22:31,570 --> 00:22:35,470
likely because people might you know see

481
00:22:35,470 --> 00:22:37,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">me as inherently a lawyer because of</font>

482
00:22:37,810 --> 00:22:40,770
whatever sort of stereotypes I

483
00:22:40,770 --> 00:22:43,530
definitely feel like my race definitely

484
00:22:43,530 --> 00:22:46,870
played a part in like not being able<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

485
00:22:46,870 --> 00:22:48,670
look the half be able to even think

486
00:22:48,670 --> 00:22:49,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">about getting justice through that</font>

487
00:22:49,690 --> 00:22:52,410
system because I know even<font color="#E5E5E5"> when I was</font>

488
00:22:52,410 --> 00:22:55,240
when I reported in college you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

489
00:22:55,240 --> 00:22:58,030
sort of saw a<font color="#E5E5E5"> very similar resistance</font>

490
00:22:58,030 --> 00:23:00,790
from the administration as well I think

491
00:23:00,790 --> 00:23:02,920
<font color="#CCCCCC">a great starting point is to provide</font>

492
00:23:02,920 --> 00:23:07,030
more training for police and in this

493
00:23:07,030 --> 00:23:09,520
matter and I asked Mary Lynn she who was

494
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:13,060
the assistant chief and in Houston who

495
00:23:13,060 --> 00:23:15,130
helped clear the backlog there recently

496
00:23:15,130 --> 00:23:19,510
and I asked her you know can you teach

497
00:23:19,510 --> 00:23:23,140
compassion to someone especially a

498
00:23:23,140 --> 00:23:27,910
police officer and her reply was you

499
00:23:27,910 --> 00:23:30,310
know some people<font color="#CCCCCC"> are obviously</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> better at</font>

500
00:23:30,310 --> 00:23:33,310
it than others but we<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to start from</font>

501
00:23:33,310 --> 00:23:35,920
a starting<font color="#E5E5E5"> point and yes people can get</font>

502
00:23:35,920 --> 00:23:38,740
better and they can<font color="#E5E5E5"> handle situations</font>

503
00:23:38,740 --> 00:23:43,870
better and just<font color="#E5E5E5"> the more that we can</font>

504
00:23:43,870 --> 00:23:48,490
help<font color="#E5E5E5"> people overcome their prejudices</font>

505
00:23:48,490 --> 00:23:50,790
about

506
00:23:50,809 --> 00:23:53,149
I don't know disbelieving survivors or

507
00:23:53,149 --> 00:23:55,720
slut-shaming or any of those other

508
00:23:55,720 --> 00:23:58,850
elements that come into well that

509
00:23:58,850 --> 00:24:01,639
basically hinder the further progress of

510
00:24:01,639 --> 00:24:06,049
cases and prosecution that that can<font color="#E5E5E5"> be a</font>

511
00:24:06,049 --> 00:24:11,120
good thing in<font color="#CCCCCC"> my opinion yeah yeah I</font>

512
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:13,039
definitely think that you know we even

513
00:24:13,039 --> 00:24:14,779
need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to start way before people decide</font>

514
00:24:14,779 --> 00:24:16,909
to be police officers if we create<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

515
00:24:16,909 --> 00:24:19,909
culture where we are you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> not where</font>

516
00:24:19,909 --> 00:24:22,009
rape myths are not the norm where we

517
00:24:22,009 --> 00:24:23,960
know the reality of it you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know that you</font>

518
00:24:23,960 --> 00:24:25,340
know<font color="#CCCCCC"> people don't lie about this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this is</font>

519
00:24:25,340 --> 00:24:27,679
not taken lightly I think it'd<font color="#CCCCCC"> be easier</font>

520
00:24:27,679 --> 00:24:31,429
to have people who<font color="#CCCCCC"> are in charge able to</font>

521
00:24:31,429 --> 00:24:35,210
be compassionate standing definitely

522
00:24:35,210 --> 00:24:37,100
thank you do you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have any other</font>
