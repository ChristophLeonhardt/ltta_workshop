tonight foreign-funded environmental charities are at it again breaking the income tax act by engaging in political campaigns it's May 23rd and you're watching the extra lavance show the viewer tax-free in your business imagine if you could say to your customers guess what you can now claim any money you paid to us you can claim that against your taxes your tax receipt it's actually a huge subsidy to your business and to your customers it's a subsidy from the rest of society to you and we all agree to that if you're doing something that is in the Latin legal phrase pro bono publico which means for the public good something for which there is no opposite point of view for example so a soup kitchen a homeless shelters training seeing-eye dogs you know helping out volunteering at a hospital we all agree that those are for the public good there's no other side to that argument being anti soup kitchen or anti food bank isn't the thing these are not controversies we all agree they're for the public good there is a special page on the Canada Revenue Agency website explaining how and why politics are banned from charities you can see in the top left corner I know if you can see that this was first published in 2003 when Jean chr√©tien was the Liberal prime minister and it's being tweaked a bit over the years but it's pretty much the same no politics and I mentioned 2003 and I mentioned Jacques reg m to point out that this is not a partisan thing it's just the legal definition of a charity and both liberal and conservative governments have implemented those rules through a nonpartisan civil service at the Canada Revenue Agency so let me read you a couple of sentences from this website this is not from the Income Tax Act itself this is a Revenue Canada explainer it's official it's on the website to help people understand the income tax act as an applies to charity so it's written in pretty plain English for normal humans to understand let me read this part it's the difference between political purposes and charitable purposes okay ready all registered charity are required by law to have exclusively charitable purposes okay well what does happen under the Act and common law an organization established for a political purpose cannot be a charity the courts have determined political purposes to be those that seek to further the interests of a particular political party or support a political party or candidate for public office and the second point they are very important retain oppose or change the law policy or decision of any level of government in Canada or a foreign country so for example you can't support Justin Trudeau or oppose Stephen Harper I mean you can fill your boots then then you can't be a charity and get free money from the government you can't oppose the Kinder Morgan pipeline and its approval process remember that's a policy that's a decision of a government I mean again you can oppose them but then you can't call yourself a charity and get free money let me just two more sentences that really turn on the light bulb for me this is the plain English in from the government which is very rare let me read it it says a political purpose such as seeking a ban on deer hunting requires a charity to enter into a debate about whether such a ban is good rather than providing or working towards an accepted public benefit it also means that in order to assess the public benefit of a political purpose a court would have to take sides in a political debate that's so clear isn't it so some people could think that banning deer hunting is a really good idea really noble you could think it's really for the public good and charitable but there is another side of the debate - there's another point of view that is legitimate it could be wrong but it's legitimate and therefore what you think is a public good someone else doesn't that's politics it's not charity food banks there's no other side to the story on food banks there's no legitimate anti food bank point of view an T Hospital point of view right Justin Trudeau Stephen Harper Kinder Morgan pipeline expansion those are all legitimate subjects for controversy and debate so you don't get to be a tax-free charity if you hate a pie plying or hate a politician because that's just lobbying or political chatter you're not housing the homeless that we all agree on which brings me to Canada's environmental charities given what I've just shown you from the Canada Revenue Agency's long-standing rules against politics what do you make of this it's a tweet have you heard our new radio ads calling on the federal government to cancel its plans to bail out Kinder Morgan's pipeline and oil tanker project give him a listen and visit our website to call your MP and stop this bailout today stop Kinder Morgan so that was a tweet from the Western Canada wilderness society here listen to the 30-second ad that they're running have you heard Justin Trudeau wants to waste billions of our tax dollars to bail out Kinder Morgan's pipeline and oil tankers public funds should pay for schools and hospitals not bailing out a project that puts the BC coast at risk of an oil spill disaster because it will be you and me not these Texas billionaires who will be on the hook for the cleanup we don't have much time to stop this so call your MP today and tell them to stop the Kinder Morgan bailout a message from Leadnow Sierra Club BC wilderness committee and some of us so that was also from the Sierra Club of BC hey well here's the CRA charities page for the Sierra Club of BC foundation it is a registered charity and if you click on their official website link on the CRA this is what you are taken to stop Kinder Morgan pipeline it's a big protest the first word you see on the website by definition a debate and dispute a political controversy with two different sides the main thing on their website of a charity and that tweeted stuff that was from the Western Canada wilderness committee sir LSATs society a moment ago well the wilderness committee is another registered CRA charity this is taken from revenue Canada's own page and look at this one make sure you join us in Montreal on May 27th to stop Kinder Morgan that's from something called climate reality you see that up there well that's a registered charity too linked to Al Gore the climate huckster who made almost a hundred million dollars in a business deal with the OPEC dictator ship of Qatar and here's their charity registration with the Canada Revenue Agency so what have we here well the left might say we see free speech well sure you do but it's illegal if you want free money from the rest of us you've got to make a choice you can't scam free money from the rest of taxpayers through the CRA by calling yourself a charity but then also engage in political campaigns that's just against the law now I can understand why they all think they can get away with it here's a David Suzuki of the David Suzuki Foundation literally starring in an old campaign ad for the Liberal Party with the disgraced former Premier of Ontario Dalton McGuinty and Gerald Butz was actually working for me McGinty he's now the principal secretary to Justin Trudeau he'll add another extremely political quote charity called the World Wildlife Fund Canada before he ran Trudeau's campaign in fact weirdly the world wildlife on Canada continued to pay but a six-figure salary long after he went to work for Trudeau how's that even legal so he was still being paid by the World Wildlife Fund when he worked for Trudeau maybe that's why these charities think they can get away with it now the Fox is in charge of the henhouse the guy who worked for Dalton McGuinty the guy who worked for Trudeau he's fine with this that's exactly why they think they can get away with it you might recall that a few years ago when I ran something called the ethical oil Institute we brought this law breaking to the attention of the public and to the CRA itself and dozens of illegal charity scams were investigated and these very groups were audited and they failed their audits I mean of course I read you the law here's a CBC news story totally torqued of course I mean look the CBC is where David Suzuki has worked for years and the Suzuki foundation was one of the groups being investigated so of course the CBC was giving you pure environmentalist propaganda here but let me quote from the facts buried within the CBC spin take a look political activity audits of charities suspended by Liberals and then look at the smaller text their panel report says charities should be free to engage in politics Minister suspends infamous audit program I love that the audits were infamous I'm sure every single tax cheat in history has said their audit was infamous whether Gretchen was running the government or Mulrooney or Harper or Trudeau in fact Greenpeace was audited both under Kretsch and and under Mulrooney although both audits were done by the neutral civil service auditor it wasn't politically the time it was Greenpeace it was political and it actually had his charity status revoked twice but look at this look at this from the same story National Revenue Minister Diane leboutillier quote has asked the CRA to suspend all action in relation to the remaining audits and objections that were part of the political activities audit program initiated in 2012 a release Thursday said and then they read one more a spokesman for the minister Chloe Luciana Gerrard said Thursday suspension affects 12 audits of which seven have resulted in an intention to revoke charitable status wouldn't that be nice having your liberal political friends interfere at the tax department and suspend your audits you failed your audits you broke the law a lot it's been on the books for many years you're about to have your charity status revoked and lose your ability to give out receipts but you've got geryl butts in high places and he'll get right in there LeBron owes style I wonder what other friends of the Liberals have infamous audits of their businesses canceled by the Prime Minister's Office and he's not even hot he's boasting that he's interfering with the audits so seven of these charities had broken the law so badly that they were in the process of having their charity status revoked for illegal conduct but then Trudeau's Minister more accurately Gerald butts is Minister came in and told the auditors to leave go away shoo shoo I'm sorry that's a form of corruption by the way and so they're back dad it registered CRA charities campaigning politically against pipelines just like Gerald wets himself did when he ran one of the quote charities that lobbied against pipelines the World Wildlife Fund oh and by the way each of the charities I've referred to above takes funding from foreign anti oil lobby groups so yeah you got the worst of both worlds you got the corruption of the lebra nose interfering in tax audits and you've got the environmental extremism of us leftist that's Justin Trudeau's Canada or more accurately that's Gerald but says Canada that's an excerpt from my daily TV show the Ezra Levant show normally it's behind a paywall but I thought you'd like this video so we put it on YouTube if you want to subscribe to watch
