1
00:00:01,124 --> 00:00:01,456
GUILTY.

2
00:00:01,457 --> 00:00:03,292
NOW FOR SOMETHING TOTALLY

3
00:00:03,293 --> 00:00:03,725
DIFFERENT.

4
00:00:03,726 --> 00:00:04,426
AINSLEY: THANK YOU, BRIAN.

5
00:00:04,427 --> 00:00:05,494
WE HAVE ALL SEEN THE WORK

6
00:00:05,495 --> 00:00:06,328
VICE PRESIDENT PENCE HAS

7
00:00:06,329 --> 00:00:08,130
DONE FOR OUR COUNTRY AND

8
00:00:08,131 --> 00:00:09,064
NEARLY TWO DECADES OF

9
00:00:09,065 --> 00:00:09,698
POLITICAL SERVICE.

10
00:00:09,699 --> 00:00:11,934
WHAT IS HE LIKE AS A FATHER?

11
00:00:11,935 --> 00:00:12,567
STEVE: GOOD QUESTION.

12
00:00:12,568 --> 00:00:14,169
BRAND NEW BOOK GIVES AN

13
00:00:14,170 --> 00:00:15,270
UPCLOSE AND PERSONAL LOOK AT

14
00:00:15,271 --> 00:00:16,538
THE PENCE FAMILY THROUGH THE

15
00:00:16,539 --> 00:00:17,806
EYES OF ONE OF THE VICE

16
00:00:17,807 --> 00:00:18,707
PRESIDENT'S CHILDREN.

17
00:00:18,708 --> 00:00:20,042
IT'S CALLED WHERE YOU GO.

18
00:00:20,043 --> 00:00:22,244
LIFE LESSONS FROM MY FATHER.

19
00:00:22,245 --> 00:00:24,680
THE AUTHOR CHARLOTTE PENCE

20
00:00:24,681 --> 00:00:26,415
JOINS US RIGHT NOW, LIVE.

21
00:00:26,416 --> 00:00:27,916
LET'S START WITH THAT

22
00:00:27,917 --> 00:00:28,250
PICTURE.

23
00:00:28,251 --> 00:00:30,452
WHERE IS IT.

24
00:00:30,453 --> 00:00:35,057
>> IT'S FROM.

25
00:00:35,058 --> 00:00:35,991
SANDRA: BELL FLORIDA.

26
00:00:35,992 --> 00:00:37,659
>> SO MANY BOOM THINGS TO

27
00:00:37,660 --> 00:00:38,226
TALK ABOUT.

28
00:00:38,227 --> 00:00:39,361
HOW DO YOU FACED A VERSE

29
00:00:39,362 --> 00:00:40,429
CITY BEING IN A POLITICAL

30
00:00:40,430 --> 00:00:42,397
FAMILY BECAUSE THERE IS SOME

31
00:00:42,398 --> 00:00:43,732
NASTY HEADLINES OUT THRNCHT

32
00:00:43,733 --> 00:00:44,032
YEAH.

33
00:00:44,033 --> 00:00:45,400
MY DAD HAS ALWAYS REALLY

34
00:00:45,401 --> 00:00:46,468
TAUGHT US THAT, YOU KNOW,

35
00:00:46,469 --> 00:00:47,869
WHEN WE SEE PROTESTERS, HE

36
00:00:47,870 --> 00:00:49,237
ALWAYS HAS THIS THING THAT

37
00:00:49,238 --> 00:00:50,505
HE SAYS THAT'S WHAT FREEDOM

38
00:00:50,506 --> 00:00:51,006
LOOKS LIKE.

39
00:00:51,007 --> 00:00:52,808
SO FROM A VERY YOUNG AGE WE

40
00:00:52,809 --> 00:00:54,142
ALWAYS KNEW THAT WAS PART OF

41
00:00:54,143 --> 00:00:54,776
THE JOB.

42
00:00:54,777 --> 00:00:56,645
PART OF PUBLIC LIFE WAS THAT

43
00:00:56,646 --> 00:00:58,347
YOU MIGHT TAKE CRITICISM BUT

44
00:00:58,348 --> 00:00:59,214
THAT MEANS THAT THE AMERICAN

45
00:00:59,215 --> 00:01:00,549
SYSTEM IS WORKING THE WAY

46
00:01:00,550 --> 00:01:02,517
IT'S SUPPOSED TO WORK.

47
00:01:02,518 --> 00:01:03,352
STEVE: SO WHEN YOU WERE

48
00:01:03,353 --> 00:01:05,587
GROWING UP, WHAT WERE SOME

49
00:01:05,588 --> 00:01:06,922
OF THE THINGS YOU DIDN'T

50
00:01:06,923 --> 00:01:07,756
REALIZE AT THE TIME MY DAD

51
00:01:07,757 --> 00:01:09,124
IS GIVING ME A LIFE LESSON

52
00:01:09,125 --> 00:01:10,559
BUT TURNS OUT IT WAS ADVICE

53
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:11,793
THEN THAT CAN HELP ANYBODY

54
00:01:11,794 --> 00:01:12,060
NOW.

55
00:01:12,061 --> 00:01:13,328
>> OH, YEAH, ABSOLUTELY.

56
00:01:13,329 --> 00:01:15,097
MY DAD ALWAYS TELLS PEOPLE

57
00:01:15,098 --> 00:01:16,465
TO SPEAK THEIR DREAMS.

58
00:01:16,466 --> 00:01:18,100
AND WHEN HE MEETS PEOPLE ON

59
00:01:18,101 --> 00:01:19,267
THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL AND EVEN

60
00:01:19,268 --> 00:01:21,370
WHEN I WAS A LITTLE KID, HE

61
00:01:21,371 --> 00:01:22,504
WAS ALWAYS TELLING US TO

62
00:01:22,505 --> 00:01:24,139
TELL PEOPLE WHAT OUR DREAMS

63
00:01:24,140 --> 00:01:24,439
WERE.

64
00:01:24,440 --> 00:01:25,340
SO HE WRITES THE FORWARD FOR

65
00:01:25,341 --> 00:01:26,975
THE BOOK AND IN IT HE TALKS

66
00:01:26,976 --> 00:01:28,110
ABOUT TELLING ME THAT I WAS

67
00:01:28,111 --> 00:01:29,711
A WRITER FROM A YOUNG AGE,

68
00:01:29,712 --> 00:01:31,113
WHICH WAS JUST VERY

69
00:01:31,114 --> 00:01:32,581
ENCOURAGING TO ME.

70
00:01:32,582 --> 00:01:33,315
AINSLEY: IN THE FORWARD HE

71
00:01:33,316 --> 00:01:34,383
TALKS ABOUT YOU BEING THE AT

72
00:01:34,384 --> 00:01:35,484
THIS

73
00:01:35,485 --> 00:01:35,517
TYIS

74
00:01:35,518 --> 00:01:37,953
TYPICAL MIDDLE CHILD

75
00:01:37,954 --> 00:01:38,353
THOUGHTFUL.

76
00:01:38,354 --> 00:01:39,521
I SAW YOU ON THE CAMPAIGN

77
00:01:39,522 --> 00:01:43,058
TRAIL TIME AND TIME AGAIN.

78
00:01:43,059 --> 00:01:43,825
STEVE: SQUASHING DAD IN THAT

79
00:01:43,826 --> 00:01:45,293
PICTURE OH, WOW.

80
00:01:45,294 --> 00:01:46,061
AINSLEY: WHAT'S IT LIKE TO

81
00:01:46,062 --> 00:01:47,396
BE A PART OF THE PENCE

82
00:01:47,397 --> 00:01:48,563
FAMILY.

83
00:01:48,564 --> 00:01:49,431
YOUR FAMILY SEEMS FROM THE

84
00:01:49,432 --> 00:01:50,499
OUTSIDE WORLD TO BE VERY,

85
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:51,166
VERY CLOSE.

86
00:01:51,167 --> 00:01:52,834
EVERY TIME I INTERVIEW YOUR

87
00:01:52,835 --> 00:01:54,302
DAD YOUR MOM IS WITH HIM

88
00:01:54,303 --> 00:01:57,506
EVEN ON THE BORDER.

89
00:01:57,507 --> 00:01:58,640
SHE TRAVELS EVERYWHERE WITH

90
00:01:58,641 --> 00:01:58,907
HIM.

91
00:01:58,908 --> 00:01:59,775
EVEN ON THE BORDER.

92
00:01:59,776 --> 00:02:00,809
EVAN IN YOUR HOUSE BEFORE.

93
00:02:00,810 --> 00:02:01,743
HAVE YOU SCRIPTINGS ON THE

94
00:02:01,744 --> 00:02:02,611
WALL THAT ARE FRAMED.

95
00:02:02,612 --> 00:02:03,645
WHAT'S IT LIKE TO BE WHEN

96
00:02:03,646 --> 00:02:05,947
THE DOOR CLOSES, WHAT'S IT

97
00:02:05,948 --> 00:02:07,215
LIKE TO BE INSIDE THE PENCE

98
00:02:07,216 --> 00:02:07,582
HOUSEHOLD.

99
00:02:07,583 --> 00:02:08,817
>> I TALK ABOUT IN THE BOOK

100
00:02:08,818 --> 00:02:10,385
THAT WE KIND OF REFER TO

101
00:02:10,386 --> 00:02:11,386
OURSELVES AS A CIRCLE.

102
00:02:11,387 --> 00:02:12,854
THAT KIND OF ONCE YOU ARE IN

103
00:02:12,855 --> 00:02:14,256
THE CIRCLE YOU ARE NEVER

104
00:02:14,257 --> 00:02:14,523
OUT.

105
00:02:14,524 --> 00:02:18,193
AND SO IT WAS A SPECIAL TIME

106
00:02:18,194 --> 00:02:18,894
ESPECIALLY ON THE CAMPAIGN

107
00:02:18,895 --> 00:02:20,429
TRAIL FOR US TO TEST THAT

108
00:02:20,430 --> 00:02:21,530
CIRCLE EVEN WHEN WE ARE

109
00:02:21,531 --> 00:02:23,031
PHYSICALLY SEPARATED.

110
00:02:23,032 --> 00:02:24,933
THE TITLE OF THE BOOK IS

111
00:02:24,934 --> 00:02:26,334
KIND OF THAT THEME OF WHERE

112
00:02:26,335 --> 00:02:29,604
YOU GO I WILL GO WITH YOU.

113
00:02:29,605 --> 00:02:31,139
AND SO.

114
00:02:31,140 --> 00:02:31,773
AINSLEY: THAT'S FROM THE

115
00:02:31,774 --> 00:02:32,274
BOOK OF RUTH.

116
00:02:32,275 --> 00:02:34,042
>> YEAH, I THINK OUR FAMILY

117
00:02:34,043 --> 00:02:35,510
STAYS CLOSE AND WE SUPPORT

118
00:02:35,511 --> 00:02:37,546
ONE ANOTHER FROM WHEREVER WE

119
00:02:37,547 --> 00:02:37,879
ARE.

120
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:38,613
STEVE: THERE IS EXCERPT FROM

121
00:02:38,614 --> 00:02:39,815
THE BOOK WE ARE GOING TO

122
00:02:39,816 --> 00:02:40,115
READ.

123
00:02:40,116 --> 00:02:41,583
THIS IS YOUR FATHER TALKING

124
00:02:41,584 --> 00:02:42,951
TO BARON TRUMP, THE

125
00:02:42,952 --> 00:02:44,419
PRESIDENT'S SON, AFTER THE

126
00:02:44,420 --> 00:02:45,320
ELECTION RESULTS CAME IN

127
00:02:45,321 --> 00:02:46,221
THAT NIGHT.

128
00:02:46,222 --> 00:02:48,423
AND YOU WRITE:  YOU WANT TO

129
00:02:48,424 --> 00:02:48,857
READ THIS.

130
00:02:48,858 --> 00:02:50,192
>> SURE, YEAH.

131
00:02:50,193 --> 00:02:51,526
I OVERHEARD DAD TALKING TO

132
00:02:51,527 --> 00:02:52,260
BARON RIGHT AFTER.

133
00:02:52,261 --> 00:02:54,429
IT WAS A MOVING EXCHANGE.

134
00:02:54,430 --> 00:02:55,931
DAD TOLD BARON HAD CASS GOOD

135
00:02:55,932 --> 00:02:57,399
FOR THE COUNTRY HIS DAD WAS

136
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:58,500
GOING TO BE PRESIDENT OF THE

137
00:02:58,501 --> 00:02:58,934
UNITED STATES.

138
00:02:58,935 --> 00:03:00,335
AND HE THANKED THE YOUNGEST

139
00:03:00,336 --> 00:03:02,370
TRUMP FOR LETTING US SHARE

140
00:03:02,371 --> 00:03:04,139
THIS WITH YOU.

141
00:03:04,140 --> 00:03:05,207
STEVE: DOES THAT SOUND

142
00:03:05,208 --> 00:03:05,574
FAMILIAR?

143
00:03:05,575 --> 00:03:06,942
>> YEAH.

144
00:03:06,943 --> 00:03:08,043
IT WAS GREAT.

145
00:03:08,044 --> 00:03:09,444
THAT NIGHT WAS AMAZING

146
00:03:09,445 --> 00:03:10,112
ELECTION NIGHT.

147
00:03:10,113 --> 00:03:11,480
GUY INTO DETAIL ABOUT IT IN

148
00:03:11,481 --> 00:03:11,980
THE BOOK.

149
00:03:11,981 --> 00:03:13,582
THAT WAS REALLY SPECIAL FOR

150
00:03:13,583 --> 00:03:15,183
US TO BE ABLE TO SHARE THAT

151
00:03:15,184 --> 00:03:16,451
EXPERIENCE WITH THE TRUMPS.

152
00:03:16,452 --> 00:03:17,953
AND THEY REALLY DID INCLUDE

153
00:03:17,954 --> 00:03:19,988
US IN THE SAME WAY MY DAD IS

154
00:03:19,989 --> 00:03:21,556
INCLUDED MY SIBLINGS AND I

155
00:03:21,557 --> 00:03:22,624
IN EVERYTHING WE WANT TO DO

156
00:03:22,625 --> 00:03:24,025
WITH THEM.

157
00:03:24,026 --> 00:03:24,759
STEVE: SURE, ON THE BIGGEST

158
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:25,894
NIGHT OF YOUR DAD'S

159
00:03:25,895 --> 00:03:27,028
POLITICAL LIFE HE SPENDS

160
00:03:27,029 --> 00:03:28,763
TIME TALKING TO THE

161
00:03:28,764 --> 00:03:30,132
PRESIDENT'S LITTLE CHILD,

162
00:03:30,133 --> 00:03:30,599
SMALLEST CHILD.

163
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:31,433
>> YEAH.

164
00:03:31,434 --> 00:03:32,901
WELL, YOU KNOW, THEIR FAMILY

165
00:03:32,902 --> 00:03:34,035
WAS SO INCLUSIVE AND

166
00:03:34,036 --> 00:03:35,837
SUPPORTIVE OF US THE WHOLE

167
00:03:35,838 --> 00:03:36,138
TIME.

168
00:03:36,139 --> 00:03:37,405
AND THEY WERE JUST REALLY

169
00:03:37,406 --> 00:03:38,240
AMAZING TO WATCH.

170
00:03:38,241 --> 00:03:39,774
THEY ARE A STRONG UNION

171
00:03:39,775 --> 00:03:41,476
REALLY INSPIRED ME.

172
00:03:41,477 --> 00:03:42,177
AINSLEY: WHAT'S SOMETHING WE

173
00:03:42,178 --> 00:03:43,078
DON'T KNOW ABOUT YOUR DAD

174
00:03:43,079 --> 00:03:43,945
THAT YOU WRITE ABOUT?

175
00:03:43,946 --> 00:03:45,347
>> I WRITE ABOUT I WANT

176
00:03:45,348 --> 00:03:47,182
PEOPLE TO SEE HOW GREAT OF A

177
00:03:47,183 --> 00:03:47,883
DAD HE IS.

178
00:03:47,884 --> 00:03:50,318
I THINK THAT, YOU KNOW, ONE

179
00:03:50,319 --> 00:03:51,319
OF THE THINGS HE SAYS ALL

180
00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:53,855
THE TIME IS KIND OF CORNY,

181
00:03:53,856 --> 00:03:55,123
BIGGEST TITLE HE WILL EVER

182
00:03:55,124 --> 00:03:56,391
HOLD IS THE TITLE OF DAD.

183
00:03:56,392 --> 00:03:58,193
AND I HOPE THAT THAT COMES

184
00:03:58,194 --> 00:03:59,694
ACROSS THAT HE HAS HELD THAT

185
00:03:59,695 --> 00:04:00,929
TITLE VERY WELL.

186
00:04:00,930 --> 00:04:01,630
AINSLEY: I LOVE THE IDEA OF

187
00:04:01,631 --> 00:04:02,998
WHAT YOU DID IN THE LAST

188
00:04:02,999 --> 00:04:03,331
CHAPTER.

189
00:04:03,332 --> 00:04:04,533
YOU WROTE A LETTER TO YOUR

190
00:04:04,534 --> 00:04:04,900
CHILDREN.

191
00:04:04,901 --> 00:04:06,635
>> YEAH.

192
00:04:06,636 --> 00:04:07,402
AINSLEY: READ THAT LETTER.

193
00:04:07,403 --> 00:04:08,570
GIVE YOU A GOOD IDEA.

194
00:04:08,571 --> 00:04:09,771
