Nigeria is a country going up against all sorts of hardship poverty corruption the resurgence of terrorist groups but there's an even more fundamental one water about 40% of the country's population almost 70 million people live without access to clean water for the 80,000 people who live here there's only one borehole for every 60 households used to walk miles to fetch water by the river now we fetch from this borehole nearby and have time to cook and wash we only use the water for cooking and them laundry of course it's not there we don't drink it so we had to look for it and it is like packaged water that's what we you know we drink because of how the water systems pipes have decayed now a quarter of all supplies literally seep through the cracks three major companies have been shortlisted to seize control of Nigeria's water by privatizing it healthy competition or so you'd think but actually it's a choice between the bad the ugly and their really ugly the first company I'm going to talk about is Frances Veolia it could be known for many things but it's notorious for just one it oversaw the quality of water in the US city of Flint Michigan which turned into a major disaster it's fascinating in its own way but in response Veolia shrugged it off saying some are just too sensitive competing with it is a company called abengoa which took a shot at facilitating water privatization in bolivia and let me just show you how that turned out not only did it triple the price of water abengoa imposed fees on collecting rainwater which well was the last straw and the final company I will look at is a Dubai based metal through its largest shareholder it's linked to the infamous Dakota access pipeline which was accused of ignoring heritage and putting business before people well frankly Nigerians don't stand to lose much when it comes to water supply it's so scarce activists have called for a state of emergency but with business sharks calling the shots the country's crisis conduct down the drain entirely you
