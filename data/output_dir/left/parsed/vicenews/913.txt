not for me mum not for me not for me
right looking good dad I kind of like it
oh you know I I'm not sure about this I
was hitting in a human form on planet
Earth where I was born that's a bit old
in it but I kind of like it oh you know
I it's a bit like Atari music in it got
ping pong it up and along it's a bit odd
I mean I'm sure the nice people in that
but it's bit odd but I didn't mind it
actually that is the blue good name good
name for a band
Kuki in it kookiness who was it that
would be sparks you know what I was
just thinking that the little guy would
attach the gun I used to sit there wait
on the piano I thought in my head I was
going sounds a bit like sparks
you're coming round too late
I've taken off my face and you won't lie
not for me no Ivan it's not for me it's
not my kind of music mom so she's a nice
person what kind of scene do you see
this music in you know the teacups in
Disneyland sitting on them in the brain
