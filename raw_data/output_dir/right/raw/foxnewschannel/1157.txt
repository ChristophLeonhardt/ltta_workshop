THEN WE DO FOR ADULTS.

192
00:05:32,996 --> 00:05:34,197
EVERY TIME SOMEBODY GETS

193
00:05:34,197 --> 00:05:36,400
PROSECUTED IN AMERICA FOR CRIME,

194
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:38,168
AMERICANS IN SIN, AND THEY GO TO

195
00:05:38,168 --> 00:05:39,603
JAIL, THEY ARE SEPARATED FROM

196
00:05:39,736 --> 00:05:42,372
WE DON'T WANT TO DO THIS AT ALL.

197
00:05:42,372 --> 00:05:43,373
IF PEOPLE DON'T WANT TO BE

198
00:05:43,373 --> 00:05:44,574
SEPARATED FROM THEIR CHILDREN,

199
00:05:44,574 --> 00:05:47,144
THEY SHOULD NOT BRING THEM WITH

200
00:05:47,144 --> 00:05:47,444
THEM.

201
00:05:47,444 --> 00:05:49,713
>> Bret: THE PRESIDENT

202
00:05:49,713 --> 00:05:52,549
TWEETING ALSO THIS MORNING:

203
00:05:52,549 --> 00:05:53,216
"SEPARATING FAMILIES AT THE

204
00:05:53,216 --> 00:05:53,850
BORDER IS THE FAULT OF BAD

205
00:05:53,850 --> 00:05:54,484
LEGISLATION PASSED BY THE

206
00:05:54,484 --> 00:05:54,851
DEMOCRATS.

207
00:05:54,851 --> 00:05:55,552
BORDER SECURITY LAWS SHOULD BE

208
00:05:55,552 --> 00:05:56,353
CHANGED BUT THE DEMS CAN'T GET

209
00:05:56,353 --> 00:05:56,887
THEIR ACT TOGETHER!

210
00:05:56,887 --> 00:06:05,595
STARTED THE WALL."

211
00:06:05,595 --> 00:06:06,329
MOLLIE, DON'T KNOW IF THAT'S IN

212
00:06:06,329 --> 00:06:07,998
LINE WITH WHAT WE KNOW.

213
00:06:07,998 --> 00:06:09,399
>> THE FACT REMAINS THAT IF

214
00:06:09,399 --> 00:06:10,367
CONGRESS WANTS TO CHANGE THE

215
00:06:10,367 --> 00:06:11,168
LOST WHERE THEY SHOULD.

216
00:06:11,168 --> 00:06:12,736
THERE'S A BIGGER ISSUE AT PLAY

217
00:06:12,736 --> 00:06:16,173
WHICH IS WE HAVE TO COPE

218
00:06:16,173 --> 00:06:16,773
COMPUTING IDEAS.

219
00:06:16,773 --> 00:06:18,775
YOU EITHER HAVE BORDERS AND LAWS

220
00:06:18,775 --> 00:06:22,979
THAT ENFORCE THE BORDERS OR YOU

221
00:06:22,979 --> 00:06:23,580
DON'T.

222
00:06:23,580 --> 00:06:25,148
IF YOU HAVE BORDERS AND HAVE

223
00:06:25,148 --> 00:06:26,616
LAWS TO ENFORCE THE BORDERS,

224
00:06:26,616 --> 00:06:27,751
DOESN'T MEAN ANYONE WHO WANTS TO

225
00:06:27,751 --> 00:06:30,587
COME IN GETS TO COME IN UNDER

226
00:06:30,587 --> 00:06:31,088
ANY CIRCUMSTANCES.

227
00:06:31,088 --> 00:06:32,989
THERE ARE VERY DIFFICULT

228
00:06:32,989 --> 00:06:34,024
SITUATIONS INVOLVING PEOPLE WHO

229
00:06:34,024 --> 00:06:35,459
WERE FLEEING COUNTRIES AND

230
00:06:35,459 --> 00:06:37,327
SEEKING REFUGEE STATUS, DOESN'T

231
00:06:37,327 --> 00:06:38,495
MEAN IT'S AUTOMATICALLY GRANTED

232
00:06:38,495 --> 00:06:39,329
OR AUTOMATICALLY QUALIFY.

233
00:06:39,329 --> 00:06:41,798
WE SHOULD STOP TALKING ABOUT

234
00:06:41,798 --> 00:06:43,633
THESE SORT OF EXTREME SITUATIONS

235
00:06:43,633 --> 00:06:45,168
AND DEAL WITH THE REALLY

236
00:06:45,168 --> 00:06:45,869
FUNDAMENTAL ISSUE OF OUR

237
00:06:45,869 --> 00:06:48,171
IMMIGRATION POLICY, WHETHER

238
00:06:48,171 --> 00:06:50,207
MEETS THIS COUNTRY'S NEEDS AND

239
00:06:50,207 --> 00:06:51,341
WHETHER IT'S SATISFYING WITH THE

240
00:06:51,341 --> 00:06:51,908
AMERICAN PEOPLE WANT.

241
00:06:51,908 --> 00:06:53,110
THEY ARE NOT GETTING A LOT OF

242
00:06:53,110 --> 00:06:53,810
GOOD DESCRIPTIONS OF THE

243
00:06:53,810 --> 00:06:56,346
CONGRESSIONAL.

244
00:06:56,346 --> 00:06:58,281
>> Bret: MARA, THERE'S NOT A

245
00:06:58,281 --> 00:06:59,015
SENSE CONGRESS IS MOVING QUICKLY

246
00:06:59,015 --> 00:07:01,184
OR AT ALL.

247
00:07:01,184 --> 00:07:02,652
>> NO, BUT WITH SO CONFUSING IF

248
00:07:02,652 --> 00:07:07,224
YOU HAVE JEFF SESSIONS SAYING WE

249
00:07:07,224 --> 00:07:08,558
ARE GOING TO SEPARATE FAMILIES

250
00:07:08,558 --> 00:07:09,392
FROM THEIR CHILDREN.

251
00:07:09,392 --> 00:07:12,429
IT IS MEANT TO BE A DETERRENT,

252
00:07:12,429 --> 00:07:12,929
LIKE YOU HEARD THE

253
00:07:12,929 --> 00:07:13,497
ATTORNEY GENERAL SAY.

254
00:07:13,497 --> 00:07:14,898
IF YOU DON'T WANT TO BE

255
00:07:14,898 --> 00:07:16,967
SEPARATED FROM YOUR KIDS, DON'T

256
00:07:16,967 --> 00:07:18,201
COME HERE.

257
00:07:18,201 --> 00:07:18,869
THEN YOU HAVE DONALD TRUMP,

258
00:07:18,869 --> 00:07:22,539
INSTEAD OF SUPPORTING THE POLICY

259
00:07:22,539 --> 00:07:23,273
OF THE ADMINISTRATION COMMITTEE

260
00:07:23,273 --> 00:07:25,142
IS SOMEHOW BLAMING IT ON

261
00:07:25,142 --> 00:07:26,376
DEMOCRATS.

262
00:07:26,376 --> 00:07:27,978
IT'S PRETTY CONFUSING.

263
00:07:27,978 --> 00:07:29,546
I THINK HE FEELS SENSITIVE ABOUT

264
00:07:29,546 --> 00:07:33,183
THE CRITICISM THE ADMINISTRATION

265
00:07:33,183 --> 00:00:00,000
HAS GOTTEN FOR SEPARATING KIDS
