00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,680
hi<font color="#E5E5E5"> everyone i read an article the other</font>

2
00:00:01,680 --> 00:00:03,030
day about<font color="#E5E5E5"> emma watson because i'm nearly</font>

3
00:00:03,030 --> 00:00:04,859
24<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm all I think about</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> every day is</font>

4
00:00:04,859 --> 00:00:06,899
still Harry Potter and I get Harold a

5
00:00:06,899 --> 00:00:08,670
Google Alert sent to my phone just in

6
00:00:08,670 --> 00:00:10,380
the event that JK Rowling a set<font color="#CCCCCC"> on some</font>

7
00:00:10,380 --> 00:00:12,030
tiny website on some tiny corner of the

8
00:00:12,030 --> 00:00:13,559
internet that she's writing Hogwarts a

9
00:00:13,559 --> 00:00:15,630
history anyway so this article<font color="#CCCCCC"> was kind</font>

10
00:00:15,630 --> 00:00:16,920
of on the cost of Poseidon since the

11
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:18,630
nature of my job has changed and also

12
00:00:18,630 --> 00:00:20,550
the nature of YouTube fame and celebrity

13
00:00:20,550 --> 00:00:22,560
has changed<font color="#E5E5E5"> and it's becoming this weird</font>

14
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:25,050
thing I found<font color="#E5E5E5"> myself really grossed out</font>

15
00:00:25,050 --> 00:00:27,449
by anything even slightly gotta pee and

16
00:00:27,449 --> 00:00:29,429
celeb news and celeb updates because

17
00:00:29,429 --> 00:00:31,140
just feels<font color="#E5E5E5"> really invasive and intrusive</font>

18
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:32,820
and I just makes me feel<font color="#E5E5E5"> a bit ill I</font>

19
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:34,530
can't like passively consumer anymore

20
00:00:34,530 --> 00:00:35,610
because I've started to see all these

21
00:00:35,610 --> 00:00:37,440
celebrities as people and it's just

22
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:39,360
horrifying if I could just go<font color="#CCCCCC"> back to</font>

23
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:41,309
see them as objects for my consumption

24
00:00:41,309 --> 00:00:43,050
in my enjoyment<font color="#E5E5E5"> that would be great</font>

25
00:00:43,050 --> 00:00:44,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">another part of this is getting to an</font>

26
00:00:44,430 --> 00:00:46,050
age<font color="#E5E5E5"> with so many my friends my English</font>

27
00:00:46,050 --> 00:00:47,520
degree<font color="#E5E5E5"> I have bylines absolutely</font>

28
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:48,840
everywhere in this whole range of

29
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:50,340
publications<font color="#E5E5E5"> as they build their career</font>

30
00:00:50,340 --> 00:00:51,809
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> the stories I've heard from behind</font>

31
00:00:51,809 --> 00:00:53,430
the scenes<font color="#CCCCCC"> of these got rags make me</font>

32
00:00:53,430 --> 00:00:56,219
want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> like build a hand out of plugs</font>

33
00:00:56,219 --> 00:00:58,590
and punch someone in the face with<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

34
00:00:58,590 --> 00:01:00,270
everyone knows that plugs are the most

35
00:01:00,270 --> 00:01:02,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">painful thing or actually what I would</font>

36
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:05,369
do is I would build a floor of plugs and

37
00:01:05,369 --> 00:01:07,170
then<font color="#E5E5E5"> just make them walk all over it I'm</font>

38
00:01:07,170 --> 00:01:09,090
a Dark Soul anyway I'm getting so far

39
00:01:09,090 --> 00:01:10,260
off the point<font color="#E5E5E5"> now</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that I'm basically a</font>

40
00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:11,700
candidate<font color="#CCCCCC"> for the US presidential</font>

42
00:01:13,110 --> 00:01:14,189
allowed to make those jokes in this

43
00:01:14,189 --> 00:01:15,509
article so ever wants<font color="#E5E5E5"> to break up with</font>

44

46
00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:20,729
me and she went<font color="#CCCCCC"> on a silent retreat and</font>

47
00:01:20,729 --> 00:01:21,600
that led me<font color="#E5E5E5"> to think about</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> my</font>

48
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:23,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">relationship with silence and also</font>

49
00:01:23,430 --> 00:01:25,140
recently with turning inwards I'm an

50
00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:26,460
extrovert and I know<font color="#E5E5E5"> that the internet</font>

51
00:01:26,460 --> 00:01:28,320
sometimes treats<font color="#E5E5E5"> extroverts of mythical</font>

52
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:29,850
creatures whose entire purpose in life

53
00:01:29,850 --> 00:01:31,890
<font color="#CCCCCC">is not understanding introvert but I'm</font>

54
00:01:31,890 --> 00:01:33,390
an extrovert I get my energy from

55
00:01:33,390 --> 00:01:35,009
spending time with other people it's how

56
00:01:35,009 --> 00:01:36,869
i recharge<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's my enough hardest and</font>

57
00:01:36,869 --> 00:01:38,670
it's just when happiness feels most real

58
00:01:38,670 --> 00:01:40,140
before<font color="#CCCCCC"> it slips through my fingers and</font>

59
00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:41,610
falls away and spending time<font color="#E5E5E5"> with other</font>

60
00:01:41,610 --> 00:01:43,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">people is still my energy source even on</font>

61
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:45,600
days when I feel isolated and it's

62
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:46,860
tempting to throw up my hands and say

63
00:01:46,860 --> 00:01:49,110
hey I'm alone<font color="#CCCCCC"> in this world</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm a brain</font>

64
00:01:49,110 --> 00:01:50,939
and of that everyone<font color="#E5E5E5"> I matched with has</font>

65
00:01:50,939 --> 00:01:52,590
a gun in their profile picture and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font>

66
00:01:52,590 --> 00:01:54,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">really weird online dating here but</font>

67
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:56,549
silence I've already good silence but

68
00:01:56,549 --> 00:01:58,049
Harry<font color="#CCCCCC"> what Emma Watson silent retreat</font>

69
00:01:58,049 --> 00:01:59,520
made me think that I've spent the last

70
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:02,100
few years kind of essentially silent at

71
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:04,799
various points if not in silence myself

72
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:06,479
silent when i was working remotely i

73
00:02:06,479 --> 00:02:08,220
wasn't talking to anyone for sweets the

74
00:02:08,220 --> 00:02:09,720
day and he's not with my own voice maybe

75
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:10,130
with my

76
00:02:10,130 --> 00:02:11,570
typing hands when you live by yourself

77
00:02:11,570 --> 00:02:13,340
you're silent except when you sing aloud

78
00:02:13,340 --> 00:02:14,750
to yourself and talk to yourself and

79
00:02:14,750 --> 00:02:16,070
tell yourself about your day<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then</font>

80
00:02:16,070 --> 00:02:17,210
what I've also found in the last few

81
00:02:17,210 --> 00:02:18,650
years is that when my brain is really

82
00:02:18,650 --> 00:02:20,810
tired and really stressed and chemically

83
00:02:20,810 --> 00:02:22,820
imbalanced as a default I'm also kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

84
00:02:22,820 --> 00:02:24,860
silent then two more than ever<font color="#CCCCCC"> before I</font>

85
00:02:24,860 --> 00:02:26,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">found myself hanging out with new</font>

86
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:28,610
friends old friends close friends people

87
00:02:28,610 --> 00:02:30,230
have just met and not really knowing

88
00:02:30,230 --> 00:02:32,540
what to say it I'm half Mexican so

89
00:02:32,540 --> 00:02:34,580
that's a big deal it's like my voice has

90
00:02:34,580 --> 00:02:36,170
<font color="#CCCCCC">been stolen by a sea witch or something</font>

91
00:02:36,170 --> 00:02:37,580
when I'm in those modes it's about

92
00:02:37,580 --> 00:02:38,930
waiting for<font color="#CCCCCC"> a topic to come up that I</font>

93
00:02:38,930 --> 00:02:40,550
feel comfortable<font color="#CCCCCC"> talking</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about so it's</font>

94
00:02:40,550 --> 00:02:42,740
often a really dire complex sort of

95
00:02:42,740 --> 00:02:44,930
issue about pain and suffering around

96
00:02:44,930 --> 00:02:46,970
the world and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's very</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> critical and it</font>

97
00:02:46,970 --> 00:02:48,890
also makes<font color="#CCCCCC"> me feel negative and quite</font>

98
00:02:48,890 --> 00:02:50,570
angry in a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> ways I may just be</font>

99
00:02:50,570 --> 00:02:51,890
misremembering here but I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't think</font>

100
00:02:51,890 --> 00:02:53,420
comfort<font color="#E5E5E5"> has ever come into it for me</font>

101
00:02:53,420 --> 00:02:54,920
before<font color="#CCCCCC"> I use just say whatever the</font>

102
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:56,990
I wanted to say on a day-to-day basis I

103
00:02:56,990 --> 00:02:59,030
spend so much my time loving things and

104
00:02:59,030 --> 00:03:00,230
me excited about things and being

105
00:03:00,230 --> 00:03:02,000
enthusiastic about things it does make

106
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,710
<font color="#CCCCCC">me sad that I've sort of lost the</font>

107
00:03:03,710 --> 00:03:05,480
ability to communicate you that in some

108
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:06,950
way it's like<font color="#E5E5E5"> I can't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> really jump start</font>

109
00:03:06,950 --> 00:03:08,240
anymore but if you got me on to the

110
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:10,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">topic of land mines or racism in the</font>

111
00:03:10,130 --> 00:03:12,230
film industry then here i am to converse

112
00:03:12,230 --> 00:03:13,820
I part of me thinks that so much has

113
00:03:13,820 --> 00:03:15,050
happened to me in the last four years

114
00:03:15,050 --> 00:03:17,000
that my brain is kind of forced me in on

115
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,830
a silent retreat but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm going to get</font>

116
00:03:18,830 --> 00:03:20,690
out of<font color="#CCCCCC"> that I'm not enjoying it anymore</font>

117
00:03:20,690 --> 00:03:22,670
i'm a lonely<font color="#CCCCCC"> Brit living in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> india for</font>

118
00:03:22,670 --> 00:03:24,830
those seeking friends and<font color="#E5E5E5"> i just can't</font>

119
00:03:24,830 --> 00:03:26,090
be like that anymore and i also gonna

120
00:03:26,090 --> 00:03:27,740
have a lot of common denominators i used

121
00:03:27,740 --> 00:03:29,120
to say anymore so i can't really be like

122
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:31,130
oh hey<font color="#CCCCCC"> that David Cameron what a wanker</font>

123

125
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:39,170
around me while I listen to music<font color="#CCCCCC"> while</font>

126
00:03:39,170 --> 00:03:41,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">I right and now what I work because I</font>

127
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:41,990
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> really like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the sound of air</font>

128
00:03:41,990 --> 00:03:43,340
<font color="#CCCCCC">conditioning it just gets into</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> my head</font>

129

and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it goes and I also can't sleep</font>

130
00:03:45,260 --> 00:03:46,730
without listening to<font color="#E5E5E5"> audiobooks because</font>

131
00:03:46,730 --> 00:03:48,650
Indianapolis is so silent I had the<font color="#E5E5E5"> same</font>

132
00:03:48,650 --> 00:03:50,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">problem when I was in Exeter and it was</font>

133
00:03:50,780 --> 00:03:53,390
so quiet I couldn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> hear anything I need</font>

134
00:03:53,390 --> 00:03:55,400
some<font color="#E5E5E5"> sirens and some traffic and just</font>

135
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:57,830
some general debauchery going on outside

136
00:03:57,830 --> 00:03:59,720
I just can't sleep<font color="#E5E5E5"> in this quiet</font>

137
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:01,400
environment without having an audio

138
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:02,690
because I made to listen to it<font color="#E5E5E5"> but I do</font>

139
00:04:02,690 --> 00:04:04,100
talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> to myself a lot i watch youtube</font>

140
00:04:04,100 --> 00:04:05,690
videos a lot The West Wing is on the

141
00:04:05,690 --> 00:04:07,070
background like seventy percent of the

142
00:04:07,070 --> 00:04:08,360
time and yeah I mean how can I be

143
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:09,620
expected to pay my bills about the

144
00:04:09,620 --> 00:04:11,810
soothing sounds of 1989 and vinyl I

145
00:04:11,810 --> 00:04:13,700
think what's my friend Ariana who told

146
00:04:13,700 --> 00:04:14,900
me a few<font color="#E5E5E5"> years ago there was actually</font>

147
00:04:14,900 --> 00:04:16,399
some sort of scientific biological

148
00:04:16,399 --> 00:04:17,089
reason for fear

149
00:04:17,089 --> 00:04:19,070
silence like actual pure silence because

150
00:04:19,070 --> 00:04:21,680
it means danger to animals or something

151
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:23,060
<font color="#CCCCCC">I don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know it just means that</font>

152
00:04:23,060 --> 00:04:24,530
something's<font color="#CCCCCC"> going wrong maybe it's like</font>

153
00:04:24,530 --> 00:04:26,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">a natural event going wrong or there's a</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">to die next unit that sort of thing with</font>

157
00:04:30,650 --> 00:04:32,000
the idea of silent retreat or the

158
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,560
analogy<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a sign retrieving my brain</font>

159
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:35,389
forcing itself to go on one really

160
00:04:35,389 --> 00:04:36,620
appeals to me because there's so much

161
00:04:36,620 --> 00:04:38,630
noise going on in my<font color="#E5E5E5"> head my inbox is</font>

162
00:04:38,630 --> 00:04:41,360
reaching capacity and Google is asked<font color="#CCCCCC"> me</font>

163
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:42,889
to upgrade but yeah I do kind of feel

164
00:04:42,889 --> 00:04:44,570
like I've<font color="#E5E5E5"> been on a silent retreat of</font>

165
00:04:44,570 --> 00:04:46,699
sorts the past six<font color="#E5E5E5"> months to a year or</font>

166
00:04:46,699 --> 00:04:48,530
so and it's like writing this big<font color="#E5E5E5"> wave</font>

167
00:04:48,530 --> 00:04:50,090
of going in and checking in with your

168
00:04:50,090 --> 00:04:51,590
friends and<font color="#E5E5E5"> your</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> day-to-day life and</font>

169
00:04:51,590 --> 00:04:52,940
then being pulled back out again to

170
00:04:52,940 --> 00:04:54,500
<font color="#CCCCCC">something different and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> then going in</font>

171
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:56,900
and out and in and out until you'll pull

172
00:04:56,900 --> 00:04:58,460
the way by the current sometimes and

173
00:04:58,460 --> 00:05:00,680
things get a bit serious and darker and

174
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:02,570
less pleasant but if it<font color="#CCCCCC"> is an emergency</font>

175
00:05:02,570 --> 00:05:04,820
coping mechanism or something how do you

176
00:05:04,820 --> 00:05:06,290
know when your brain has done enough

177
00:05:06,290 --> 00:05:08,270
emergency patch work how do you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know if</font>

178
00:05:08,270 --> 00:05:09,919
you're isolating yourself because it's

179
00:05:09,919 --> 00:05:11,270
easier or because you've had an

180
00:05:11,270 --> 00:05:13,010
experience that is so vastly different

181
00:05:13,010 --> 00:05:14,570
from your friends experiences that you

182
00:05:14,570 --> 00:05:16,220
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> really know how language functions</font>

183
00:05:16,220 --> 00:05:17,539
anymore none of the questions in<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

184

thoughts your answers your suggestions

etc and I'd also love to know whether

187
00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:23,810
you've gone through a quiet patch

188
00:05:23,810 --> 00:05:25,820
whether you're normally shy or sociable

189
00:05:25,820 --> 00:05:27,080
regardless of<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> something it just</font>

190
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:28,669
felt different in a way and whether it

191
00:05:28,669 --> 00:05:30,500
was ultimately<font color="#E5E5E5"> helpful or harmful at</font>
