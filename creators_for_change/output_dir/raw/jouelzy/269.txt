82
00:03:03,940 --> 00:03:05,140

83
00:03:05,140 --> 00:03:10,959
<font color="#E5E5E5">confused like so Papa Pope put Jake on</font>

84
00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:14,620
to fall in love<font color="#E5E5E5"> with Olivia to get her</font>

85
00:03:14,620 --> 00:03:20,500
away from the president from<font color="#E5E5E5"> Fitz so did</font>

86
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:23,079
what part did Olivia's mother having all

87
00:03:23,079 --> 00:03:25,570
this like how much of my suspension of

88
00:03:25,570 --> 00:03:27,280
disbelief and<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> roundabout like it's</font>

89
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:29,170
<font color="#CCCCCC">a storyline</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> even still congruent anymore</font>

90
00:03:29,170 --> 00:03:34,390
like I thought they the whole<font color="#CCCCCC"> Cyrus's</font>

91
00:03:34,390 --> 00:03:36,600
husband<font color="#E5E5E5"> James being killed and Jerry</font>

92
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:38,980
Harrison always connected to Olivia's

93
00:03:38,980 --> 00:03:42,220
mother but we know that Rowan Papa Pope

94
00:03:42,220 --> 00:03:45,010
has Olivia's mother back at<font color="#CCCCCC"> the b613</font>

95
00:03:45,010 --> 00:03:47,859
base so I'm like when is this gonna come

96
00:03:47,859 --> 00:03:49,000
full circle start to make sense again

97
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,040
because i am just five ways to<font color="#CCCCCC"> not like</font>

98
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:53,319
confused and I just<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't get it and I</font>

99
00:03:53,319 --> 00:03:56,170
feel<font color="#CCCCCC"> like you were trying to intelligent</font>

100
00:03:56,170 --> 00:03:58,269
elegance but my willing suspension of

101
00:03:58,269 --> 00:03:59,530
disbelief because in order to enjoy

102
00:03:59,530 --> 00:04:00,700
fiction you have to have a willing

103
00:04:00,700 --> 00:04:01,750
suspension of disbelief that is a

104
00:04:01,750 --> 00:04:03,400
literary<font color="#E5E5E5"> tire and I think you've</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> done</font>

105
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:04,750
jumped the shark on that shot and

106
00:04:04,750 --> 00:04:05,650
let<font color="#E5E5E5"> God</font>

107
00:04:05,650 --> 00:04:07,700
<font color="#CCCCCC">right and then how do you know what</font>

108
00:04:07,700 --> 00:04:09,290
murder I mean I really really really

109
00:04:09,290 --> 00:04:10,340
really really really really really

110
00:04:10,340 --> 00:04:11,450
really really really really really

111
00:04:11,450 --> 00:04:12,859
really really does take with you I

112
00:04:12,859 --> 00:04:14,060
really want<font color="#CCCCCC"> a life how to get away with</font>

113
00:04:14,060 --> 00:04:18,548
murder but<font color="#CCCCCC"> again oh I'll be now in Ike I</font>

114
00:04:18,548 --> 00:04:21,858
think that's why and end all other recap

115
00:04:21,858 --> 00:04:23,060
seems like the first episode because

116
00:04:23,060 --> 00:04:26,180
it's the between the flashbacks at who's

117
00:04:26,180 --> 00:04:29,030
sleeping with who and who get who fired

118
00:04:29,030 --> 00:04:31,130
and who having a relation it's just a

119
00:04:31,130 --> 00:04:33,440
whole lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of sexing and a whole whole</font>

120
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:35,090
lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of captain save a hoe and going on</font>

121
00:04:35,090 --> 00:04:37,009
right now and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I gave a murder and so I</font>

122
00:04:37,009 --> 00:04:38,360

123
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:41,330
season<font color="#E5E5E5"> ends because</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I'll</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be gets in it</font>

watching boardwalk empire which series

gaming I usually watch but chalky white

198

epic because they had<font color="#E5E5E5"> a daughter Matlin</font>

200
00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:34,160

whatevers but I am<font color="#CCCCCC"> interested in seeing</font>

203
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:40,400
how they wrap up this entire show

204
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:43,280
because it<font color="#E5E5E5"> is strongly based on real</font>

205
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:45,410
life and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it does follow a lot of story</font>

206
00:07:45,410 --> 00:07:47,570
lines of what has what happened during

207
00:07:47,570 --> 00:07:49,850
Prohibition with the kind of rise of the

208
00:07:49,850 --> 00:07:51,410
Moxie is specifically in Atlantic City

209
00:07:51,410 --> 00:07:53,780
area and Nucky Thompson is based off a

210
00:07:53,780 --> 00:07:55,550
real light real<font color="#CCCCCC"> life character who did</font>

211
00:07:55,550 --> 00:07:57,310
live to be 85 so it will be interesting

212
00:07:57,310 --> 00:07:59,300
with the progression that they're going

213
00:07:59,300 --> 00:08:00,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">with it they actually do kill off the</font>

331
00:12:11,269 --> 00:12:12,860
finally made it to New York and I really

332
00:12:12,860 --> 00:12:14,120
really really it was<font color="#CCCCCC"> going to happen</font>

333
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:16,759
<font color="#E5E5E5">eventually it's from one of the doctors</font>

who was in Doctors Without Borders I

335
00:12:18,949 --> 00:12:20,600
believe he came back from a mission trip

336
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:23,509
from West Africa and I have not<font color="#E5E5E5"> spoken</font>

337
00:12:23,509 --> 00:12:26,170
about Ebola much because honestly

338
00:12:26,170 --> 00:12:28,240
I just want to see how it's going to

339
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:30,639
spin out and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it really it's kind of hard</font>

340
00:12:30,639 --> 00:12:33,550
to talk about Ebola in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the context</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

341
00:12:33,550 --> 00:12:34,720
it needs to be caught talked about

342
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:36,459
<font color="#CCCCCC">because</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm really not concerned about</font>

343
00:12:36,459 --> 00:12:39,130
Ebola in America<font color="#CCCCCC"> Billy is the caregivers</font>

344
00:12:39,130 --> 00:12:41,740
disease that is largely how its spread

345
00:12:41,740 --> 00:12:43,540
is spread by people who are taking<font color="#E5E5E5"> care</font>

346
00:12:43,540 --> 00:12:45,519
of those<font color="#CCCCCC"> who are</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> impacted with Ebola</font>

347
00:12:45,519 --> 00:12:47,320
whether this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> medical professionals or</font>

348
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:51,070
family members and so I'm not<font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font>

349
00:12:51,070 --> 00:12:53,320
concerned about Ebola within the context

350
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:55,389
or landscape of America because we do

351
00:12:55,389 --> 00:12:58,660
have infrastructures to<font color="#E5E5E5"> take care and</font>

352
00:12:58,660 --> 00:13:01,269
cure the disease largely<font color="#CCCCCC"> because most</font>

353
00:13:01,269 --> 00:13:02,800
people in America who are contracting it

354
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:04,839
our<font color="#CCCCCC"> healthcare</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> professionals and so</font>

355
00:13:04,839 --> 00:13:07,240
their jobs and their insurance will fly

356
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:09,279
them out to the area to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the hospitals</font>

357
00:13:09,279 --> 00:13:12,579
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> have the proper wings to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> take care</font>

358
00:13:12,579 --> 00:13:14,529
<font color="#E5E5E5">of it with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the CDC</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> being in Atlanta the</font>

359
00:13:14,529 --> 00:13:16,329
NIH being in Maryland I actually used to

360
00:13:16,329 --> 00:13:19,959
work<font color="#E5E5E5"> for NIH they got it they find a few</font>

361
00:13:19,959 --> 00:13:21,459
hospitals in New York might kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of have</font>

362
00:13:21,459 --> 00:13:22,870
the care but I do hope they send the New

363
00:13:22,870 --> 00:13:24,519
York guy either to Atlanta or to

364
00:13:24,519 --> 00:13:26,560
Maryland for the proper care that's

365
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:28,570
largely why the Liberian Thomas Eric

366
00:13:28,570 --> 00:13:31,360
Duncan did pass away because Texas Texas

367
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:32,890
hospitals wasn't ready<font color="#CCCCCC"> for him like</font>

368
00:13:32,890 --> 00:13:34,990
bottom line the CDC lie it's really

369
00:13:34,990 --> 00:13:37,149
unfortunate I think Ebola in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the context</font>

370
00:13:37,149 --> 00:13:38,740
of America does highlight one thing

371
00:13:38,740 --> 00:13:40,570
which is young to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get out and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> vote and I</font>

372
00:13:40,570 --> 00:13:42,279
<font color="#E5E5E5">don't like I don't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> if y'all realize</font>

373
00:13:42,279 --> 00:13:45,339
but I think it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> great example that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

374
00:13:45,339 --> 00:13:47,800
were able to<font color="#E5E5E5"> elect a black president and</font>

375
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:50,829
that our votes mattered are as a people

376
00:13:50,829 --> 00:13:53,380
of color in America who typically do not

377
00:13:53,380 --> 00:13:55,510
go out to vote but then we went and

378
00:13:55,510 --> 00:13:56,860
voted<font color="#E5E5E5"> for the president what we didn't</font>

379
00:13:56,860 --> 00:13:58,630
get out for a<font color="#CCCCCC"> gue</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> banario our local or</font>

380
00:13:58,630 --> 00:14:00,610
county or a city elections and it's just

381
00:14:00,610 --> 00:14:03,220
unfair to put a president in office and

382
00:14:03,220 --> 00:14:04,779
with our own lack of understanding of

383
00:14:04,779 --> 00:14:06,550
how the government<font color="#E5E5E5"> really works not</font>

384
00:14:06,550 --> 00:14:08,110
understand that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we also need</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to elect a</font>

00:14:08,110 --> 00:14:10,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">Senate and a house that will support the</font>

president it's been very hard for<font color="#E5E5E5"> Obama</font>

387
00:14:12,699 --> 00:14:15,040
and these past going on<font color="#E5E5E5"> seven years to</font>

388
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:16,810
get anything done<font color="#CCCCCC"> because wipeout really</font>

389
00:14:16,810 --> 00:14:19,089
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't like them batting line and we</font>

390
00:14:19,089 --> 00:14:21,250
didn't come out for the Goulburn<font color="#CCCCCC"> ariel</font>

391
00:14:21,250 --> 00:14:23,529
and senate elections and there's a bunch

392

of<font color="#E5E5E5"> governors</font>

393
00:14:24,649 --> 00:14:26,300
<font color="#CCCCCC">set a a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> bunch of house representatives</font>

394
00:14:26,300 --> 00:14:28,579
who called the Tea Party in other

395
00:14:28,579 --> 00:14:30,740
conservatives who were downright is out

396
00:14:30,740 --> 00:14:33,499
to make Obama's presidency difficult

397
00:14:33,499 --> 00:14:35,300
case in point with the fact that there

398
00:14:35,300 --> 00:14:37,220
is currently no surgeon general because

399
00:14:37,220 --> 00:14:40,069
obama nominated a surgeon general and<font color="#E5E5E5"> i</font>

400
00:14:40,069 --> 00:14:42,829
forget<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> guy's name but he's been</font>

401
00:14:42,829 --> 00:14:46,100
nominated for almost a year and because

402
00:14:46,100 --> 00:14:49,639
<font color="#CCCCCC">he believes</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that gun control is a public</font>

403
00:14:49,639 --> 00:14:52,249
health policy the right wing has

404
00:14:52,249 --> 00:14:55,490
entirely blocked him from being able to

405
00:14:55,490 --> 00:14:58,610
push<font color="#CCCCCC"> through with</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> his ition for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Surgeon</font>

406
00:14:58,610 --> 00:15:00,470
<font color="#CCCCCC">General so to get him confirmed and</font>

407
00:15:00,470 --> 00:15:02,689
seated as Surgeon General typically<font color="#E5E5E5"> with</font>

408
00:15:02,689 --> 00:15:04,399
something like Ebola in America

409
00:15:04,399 --> 00:15:06,949
something with a lay person who's not a

410
00:15:06,949 --> 00:15:09,079
citizen eyes and Thomas Eric Duncan

411
00:15:09,079 --> 00:15:11,509
being in the country<font color="#CCCCCC"> with the highly</font>

412
00:15:11,509 --> 00:15:13,550
infectious disease the Surgeon General

413
00:15:13,550 --> 00:15:15,110
would overlook that that's not some of

414
00:15:15,110 --> 00:15:17,540
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> CDC does and so they in turn and I'm</font>

415
00:15:17,540 --> 00:15:19,279
not<font color="#E5E5E5"> trying to excuse their missteps but</font>

416
00:15:19,279 --> 00:15:22,699
I do think this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> a big example of how</font>

417
00:15:22,699 --> 00:15:27,139
our lack of activism<font color="#CCCCCC"> within continuing</font>

418
00:15:27,139 --> 00:15:29,600
to vote be honest the presidency will

419
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:33,139
impact things like this<font color="#E5E5E5"> it just matters</font>

420
00:15:33,139 --> 00:15:35,660
and so I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> with the elections coming</font>

421
00:15:35,660 --> 00:15:39,110
up<font color="#E5E5E5"> especially in the south I can't</font>

422
00:15:39,110 --> 00:15:41,480
stress to you how<font color="#E5E5E5"> much I really really</font>

423
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:45,470
really am over the ACA the Affordable

424
00:15:45,470 --> 00:15:47,660
Care Act otherwise known as Obamacare in

425
00:15:47,660 --> 00:15:50,179
a state that not that did not opt-in to

426
00:15:50,179 --> 00:15:52,790
Medicaid expansion I am one of those

427
00:15:52,790 --> 00:15:55,069
people<font color="#E5E5E5"> whose middle income and therefore</font>

428
00:15:55,069 --> 00:15:58,790
makes too much money to be on Medicare

429
00:15:58,790 --> 00:16:01,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">but I don't make</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> enough to pay for</font>

430
00:16:01,610 --> 00:16:03,470
actual insurance and so when I was

431
00:16:03,470 --> 00:16:05,329
<font color="#E5E5E5">living in DC I had great medical</font>

432
00:16:05,329 --> 00:16:06,709
insurance i was paying out of pocket for

433
00:16:06,709 --> 00:16:08,749
it and I basically lost my insurance

434
00:16:08,749 --> 00:16:11,209
when I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> to Texas I just don't I'm not</font>

435
00:16:11,209 --> 00:16:12,410
kind of medical insurance for the next

436
00:16:12,410 --> 00:16:15,889
year and because they did not opt Texas

437
00:16:15,889 --> 00:16:17,149
as a<font color="#E5E5E5"> Republican state and just out of</font>

438
00:16:17,149 --> 00:16:18,589
<font color="#E5E5E5">the spite of being a republican state</font>

439
00:16:18,589 --> 00:16:21,170
they did not<font color="#E5E5E5"> opt</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> into the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> expansion the</font>

442
00:16:25,339 --> 00:16:27,049

the board in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the south and the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> South has</font>

act and poor communities

446
00:16:33,510 --> 00:16:36,550
disproportionately located in the south

447
00:16:36,550 --> 00:16:40,000
and every<font color="#E5E5E5"> single southern state opted</font>

448
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,610
out of Medicaid expansion I mean I've

449
00:16:42,610 --> 00:16:43,810
been<font color="#E5E5E5"> very cautious about talking about</font>

450
00:16:43,810 --> 00:16:46,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">it because I think that Ebola really</font>

451
00:16:46,990 --> 00:16:49,540
kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of highlights the need for a</font>

452
00:16:49,540 --> 00:16:52,120
medical medical infrastructure in these

453
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:54,340
countries in West Africa and even though

454
00:16:54,340 --> 00:16:57,040
<font color="#CCCCCC">Nigeria is cured there's no more cases</font>

455
00:16:57,040 --> 00:16:59,560
currently of Ebola in Nigeria I think

456
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:00,790
across<font color="#E5E5E5"> the board they're just really</font>

457
00:17:00,790 --> 00:17:03,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">isn't any country in West Africa that</font>

458
00:17:03,610 --> 00:17:06,099
has a viable medical care system and

459
00:17:06,099 --> 00:17:08,829
that's why Liberia and Sierra Leone are

460
00:17:08,829 --> 00:17:10,240
getting hit so hard I do find it

461
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:12,069
interesting that the two hardest-hit

462
00:17:12,069 --> 00:17:16,990
countries are products of America or if

463
00:17:16,990 --> 00:17:18,130
you really want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to call a spade a spade</font>

464
00:17:18,130 --> 00:17:19,540
african-american attempts at

465
00:17:19,540 --> 00:17:21,970
colonization um and they've been hit the

466
00:17:21,970 --> 00:17:24,579
hardest but they I know there's kind of

467
00:17:24,579 --> 00:17:26,949
some contention about the<font color="#E5E5E5"> West coming in</font>

468
00:17:26,949 --> 00:17:28,720
to support and it's very polarizing

469
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:30,910
whether the West should go in and

470
00:17:30,910 --> 00:17:32,260
support or whether the<font color="#E5E5E5"> West knee still</font>

471
00:17:32,260 --> 00:17:33,550
allow these countries are<font color="#CCCCCC"> doing on their</font>

472
00:17:33,550 --> 00:17:35,890
own or whatever but I do feel like as

473
00:17:35,890 --> 00:17:38,350
Americans because of our history in

474
00:17:38,350 --> 00:17:41,830
Sierra Leone and Liberia we do owe them

475
00:17:41,830 --> 00:17:46,180
some support in this um epidemic and I

476
00:17:46,180 --> 00:17:47,620
specifically think the black community

477
00:17:47,620 --> 00:17:50,260
if you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have never looked up the history</font>

478
00:17:50,260 --> 00:17:52,120
of Liberia or Sierra Leone and why their

479
00:17:52,120 --> 00:17:54,430
capitals in Monrovia and Freetown you

480
00:17:54,430 --> 00:17:56,260
should understand our impact in those

481
00:17:56,260 --> 00:18:00,520
countries we are obligated to offer some

482
00:18:00,520 --> 00:18:02,680
sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of support now the question is is a</font>

483
00:18:02,680 --> 00:18:04,870
support once it I don't know I can't

484
00:18:04,870 --> 00:18:07,300
answer that for<font color="#E5E5E5"> you but I think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> more</font>

485
00:18:07,300 --> 00:18:09,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">than just throwing money at them I do</font>

486
00:18:09,130 --> 00:18:12,970
think there should be<font color="#E5E5E5"> some while we're</font>

487
00:18:12,970 --> 00:18:14,440
over here bickering about universal

488
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:15,820
healthcare they see the hospitals<font color="#CCCCCC"> in the</font>

489
00:18:15,820 --> 00:18:17,710
first place they don't have<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

490
00:18:17,710 --> 00:18:19,750
infrastructure to take care<font color="#E5E5E5"> of this and</font>

491
00:18:19,750 --> 00:18:22,720
I think Ebola has definitely made that

492
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:25,000
very very visible I'll let your own

493
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,070
