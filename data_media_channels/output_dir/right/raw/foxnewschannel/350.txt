BE CONFIRMED ANYWAY.

7
00:00:23,548 --> 00:00:25,149
THE QUESTION IS NOT WHETHER THEY

8
00:00:25,150 --> 00:00:26,984
WILL BE NICE TO HIM BUT WHETHER

9
00:00:26,985 --> 00:00:28,652
THE OTHER JUSTICES WILL CHANGE

10
00:00:28,653 --> 00:00:29,286
THEIR VOTING BEHAVIOR IN

11
00:00:29,287 --> 00:00:29,653
RESPONSE.

12
00:00:29,654 --> 00:00:32,723
>> THE COURT IS NOT ON THE LEVEL

13
00:00:32,723 --> 00:00:33,157

ALLIES THAT.

20
00:00:44,736 --> 00:00:51,542

THE CLOTURE DEBATE WILL BE

24
00:00:57,749 --> 00:00:58,315

KAVANAUGH.

32
00:01:13,164 --> 00:01:18,202

MORNING, LADIES.

37
00:01:25,143 --> 00:01:33,183

WE CANNOT MAKE ALLEGATIONS

43
00:01:45,830 --> 00:01:46,430
AGAINST SOMEONE WITHOUT

44
00:01:46,431 --> 00:01:47,331
EVIDENCE.

45
00:01:47,332 --> 00:01:47,965
YOU HAVE TO HAVE EVIDENCE.

46
00:01:47,966 --> 00:01:52,369
BRETT CAVANAGH, I SIT WITH HIM.

47
00:01:52,370 --> 00:01:53,003
THE STORY WAS COMPELLING.

48
00:01:53,004 --> 00:01:53,570
I BELIEVE DOCTOR FORD?

49
00:01:53,571 --> 00:01:56,607
SOMETHING HAPPENED BUT IT WASN'T

50
00:01:56,608 --> 00:01:57,174
BRETT KAVANAUGH.

51
00:01:57,175 --> 00:02:04,114
>> GOING TO BE A BIG DAY.

52
00:02:04,115 --> 00:02:04,781

00:02:04,782 --> 00:02:09,152
ABOUT THE ELECTION IS HE IS

54
00:02:09,152 --> 00:02:10,052
GOING TO TEACH HOW TO FIGHT.

55
00:02:10,054 --> 00:02:18,495
>> WHEN YOU WRITE YOU FIGHT.

56
00:02:18,496 --> 00:02:19,229
I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT THIS BODY

57
00:02:19,230 --> 00:02:21,164
BUT THE FACTS.

58
00:02:21,165 --> 00:02:21,899
HOLD ON, WAIT A MINUTE AND DON'T

59
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:22,366
HOLD US TO TASK.

60
00:02:22,367 --> 00:02:24,201
YOU HAVE TO DO THAT BECAUSE IT

61
00:02:24,202 --> 00:02:25,168
HAS ALWAYS BEEN A CULTURE WHERE

62
00:02:25,169 --> 00:02:29,172
YOU ARE RACIST OR THIS OR THAT

63
00:02:29,173 --> 00:02:29,740
AND REPUBLICANS FAULT.

64
00:02:29,741 --> 00:02:36,914
NEW REPUBLICANS, WE DON'T FAULT,

65
00:02:36,915 --> 00:02:37,481
WE KNOW HOW TO FIGHT.

66
00:02:37,482 --> 00:02:38,015
I WILL SHOW YOU HOW.

67
00:02:38,016 --> 00:02:42,152
>> WHEN SENATOR COLLINS WAS

68
00:02:42,153 --> 00:02:42,886
UNLIKELY TO FINALLY STARE DOWN

69
00:02:42,887 --> 00:02:47,858
THIS ANGRY MOB AND SAY THIS IS

70
00:02:47,859 --> 00:02:49,159
MORE THAN ONE POLITICAL FIGHT,

71
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:53,997
THIS IS ABOUT FAIRNESS.

72
00:02:53,998 --> 00:02:54,731
DO YOU BELIEVE THIS IS GOING TO

73
00:02:54,732 --> 00:02:57,167
BE THE MANTRA OF REPUBLICANS

74
00:02:57,168 --> 00:02:57,601
GOING FORWARD?

75
00:02:57,602 --> 00:03:00,003
>> IT SHOULD BE, IT HAS TO BE.

76
00:03:00,004 --> 00:03:00,704
>> TRYING TO TAKE OUR COUNTRY

77
00:03:00,705 --> 00:03:01,004
BACK.

78
00:03:01,005 --> 00:03:05,542
FOR SO LONG WE ALLOW DEMOCRATS,

79
00:03:05,543 --> 00:03:06,143
LIBERALS TO CONTROL THE

80
00:03:06,144 --> 00:03:06,777
NARRATIVE AND THE PROCESS.

81
00:03:06,778 --> 00:03:20,624
WE HAVE TO MAN UP AND STAND UP

82
00:03:20,625 --> 00:03:21,358
AND STOP ALLOWING THESE PEOPLE

83
00:03:21,359 --> 00:03:21,992
TO DISMANTLE THIS COUNTRY.

84
00:03:21,993 --> 00:03:22,626

COLLINS IS.

90
00:03:25,697 --> 00:03:26,396
SHE MADE A POWERFUL REASONED

91
00:03:26,397 --> 00:03:33,170
SPEECH AND THEY SAID SENATOR

92
00:03:33,171 --> 00:03:36,873
COLLINS IS A RAPE APOLOGIST.

93
00:03:36,874 --> 00:03:37,574
THAT IS HOW THEY VIEW SOMEONE

94
00:03:37,575 --> 00:03:38,308
WHO WAS VERY RESPECTFUL IN HER

95
00:03:38,309 --> 00:03:38,642
REMARKS.

96
00:03:38,643 --> 00:03:39,376
IS ANYTHING GOOD ENOUGH FOR THE

97
00:03:39,377 --> 00:03:40,644
LEFT?

98
00:03:40,645 --> 00:03:41,378
>> NOTHING EVER GOOD ENOUGH FOR

99
00:03:41,379 --> 00:03:42,079
THEM, NOTHING NOTHING NOTHING.

100
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:46,783
WHAT WE DO IS IGNORE THEM AND

101
00:03:46,784 --> 00:03:47,517
WHEN THEY ARE PROTESTING IN THE

102
00:03:47,518 --> 00:03:53,156
STREET WE NEED TO FORM A PROTEST

103
00:03:53,157 --> 00:03:53,857
AND VOTE THESE PEOPLE OUT AND

104
00:03:53,858 --> 00:03:58,862
VOTE FOR REPUBLICANS.

YOUR SON.

108
00:04:00,798 --> 00:04:01,498
I DON'T LIKE WHAT I SAW HERE.

109
00:04:01,499 --> 00:04:08,405
ANYBODY CAN BE ACCUSED OF

110
00:04:08,406 --> 00:04:09,106
SOMETHING AND IF THEY DEFEND

111
00:04:09,107 --> 00:04:09,806
THEMSELVES, THAT IS NOT RIGHT.

112
00:04:09,807 --> 00:04:10,540

00:04:15,113 --> 00:04:17,147
>> A RED TSUNAMI.

116
00:04:17,148 --> 00:04:21,151
DEMOCRATS ARE UPSET ABOUT WHAT

117
00:04:21,152 --> 00:04:21,718
HAPPENED TO THIS MAN.

118
00:04:21,719 --> 00:04:22,419
IF YOU ARE A MINORITY WE ARE

119
00:04:22,420 --> 00:04:25,155
PART OF THE MAJORITY BECAUSE WE

IF YOU ARE BLACK IN THIS COUNTRY

122
00:04:29,660 --> 00:04:30,327
YOU SHOULD BE STANDING WITH

SOMEBODY ACCUSES YOU OF

126
00:04:37,402 --> 00:04:37,768
SOMETHING.

127
00:04:37,769 --> 00:04:38,402

SHARPTON SAID.

130
00:04:41,672 --> 00:04:42,406
THESE PEOPLE WOULD GO TO CHURCH

131
00:04:42,407 --> 00:04:45,776
AND THEN GO TO THE LYNCHING.

132
00:04:45,777 --> 00:04:46,510
THAT IS WHAT WE ARE SEEING HERE
