<font color="#E5E5E5">church I mentioned these things because</font>

57
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,090
we often over

especially when it comes to the

65
00:02:30,580 --> 00:02:32,290
you a peek into how I look at the

overall presidency even in my absolute

00:02:35,349 --> 00:02:38,530
love for Barack Obama and mice tandem

00:02:46,989 --> 00:02:49,329
and my sisters and shadiness and smart

brown girl pneus Sasha and Malia Obama

73
00:02:51,910 --> 00:02:54,489
Barack Obama's approach to foreign

74
00:02:54,489 --> 00:02:55,959
policy does give me<font color="#CCCCCC"> a bit of</font>

75
00:02:55,959 --> 00:02:58,540
consternation because foreign affairs<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

76
00:02:58,540 --> 00:03:01,060
America is a complex and complicated

77
00:03:01,060 --> 00:03:02,650
matter that you really can't go to

78
00:03:02,650 --> 00:03:05,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">president on fully until like eight to</font>

ten years<font color="#E5E5E5"> after</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> his presidency I'm not</font>

80
00:03:07,540 --> 00:03:09,879
super well versed on this but whenever I

81
00:03:09,879 --> 00:03:13,120
dig into it I either love a president

82
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:15,400
for its foreign policy or love them for

83
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:18,400
their domestic social policy but never

84
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:20,889
for both I like the ideology of Woodrow

85
00:03:20,889 --> 00:03:22,209
Wilson and his approach to foreign

86
00:03:22,209 --> 00:03:25,060
policy who Obama could at least see them

87
00:03:25,060 --> 00:03:26,470
as being a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little similar in their</font>

88
00:03:26,470 --> 00:03:28,389
approach<font color="#E5E5E5"> but he was a flat-out racist</font>

89
00:03:28,389 --> 00:03:29,920
when it came to<font color="#E5E5E5"> this domestic</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> violence</font>

90
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:32,500
or FDR lyndon b johnson who ushered in

91
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:34,720
an era<font color="#E5E5E5"> of social reform and domestic</font>

92
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:37,000
policy but<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know waging and LU zhi</font>

93
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,250
wars in<font color="#E5E5E5"> asia or placing asians and</font>

94
00:03:39,250 --> 00:03:41,650
internment camps aren't really my thing

95
00:03:41,650 --> 00:03:44,980
either though FDR was anti-imperialist

96
00:03:44,980 --> 00:03:47,169
hmm over the course of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the last three</font>

97
00:03:47,169 --> 00:03:48,489
presidencies we have seen the

98
00:03:48,489 --> 00:03:50,590
Republicans focus on empowering States
