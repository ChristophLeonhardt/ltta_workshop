well what have you been singing about Michael Cohen that is the question you've got to imagine the White House is asking this morning after reports that the president's former lawyer has spent hours talking to special counsel prosecutors in the Russia investigation Robert mother's tight-lipped team well they remains mum but according to the reports Cohen was questioned about Trump's business dealings and possible campaign ties with you guessed it Russia he was also reportedly asked if Trump ever floated the idea of a pardon to his former confidante joining me now former assistant Watergate special prosecutor and pin aficionado Jill wine banks and former assistant US attorney for the Southern District of New York Eli Koenig all right Joe no surprise Rudy Giuliani president Trump's personal attorney has said Michael Cohen has a history of lying he does but so does the President and so does Rudy Giuliani if what he's telling Robert Muller simply corroborates what Muller already has that's a tough triangle it isn't I think that even if he's just corroborating the documents that have been seized from his office and his home that would be important a lot of times when you even have tapes of conversations which we know he had and you have emails they aren't as clear as you might think they would be and they need some testimony to explain what they mean he can be very valuable we know that he was in Russia for the Trump Tower Moscow we know that he has been involved in paying off women we know that he knows a lot about the business of Donald Trump in New York and so there are a lot of potential avenues of criminal conduct that might be revealed by him and that he yes is not the most trustworthy person but as you said neither is the president and it depends on where the circumstantial evidence and corroboration comes from I would trust him if his documents support him man he could be a very happen didn't happen no collusion collusions not a crime nbc's cynthia mcfadden she spoke exclusively with the guy who set up that infamous Trump Tower meeting in June 2016 you know it was between campaign aides and some Russians Rob Goldstone is his name and I want to share a bit of that interview I've always looked at it as a bait and switch and possibly a crime I'm possibly a crime but it was a dirty offer yes it was a dirty offer that they accept yes that is true what's your take care yes so came out of that Trump our meeting we've heard the defense of well we never we the Trump people never really got any dirt out of this it doesn't really matter legally speaking because you still have a crime of conspiracy so when that offer comes in by email but what if it was a bait and switch that they can say I didn't know what it was about I thought it was about the office still a conspiracy so long as the Trump people got together and said hey we have this offer on the table from the Russians and it looks like they did from the emails you know Trump juniors famous I love it if it is what you say it is now that as long as they internally agree with each other it's still a conspiracy to violate that law that prohibits taking for an election aid whether or not anything came of it even if it was a bait and switch show the president has been uncharacteristically quiet about this Michael Cohen news does that surprise you I mean it's got to be a good idea but it's very out of character it is so out of character that of course it's surprising it would maybe indicate that he has some new lawyer who's giving him advice and that he's actually following it he's been quiet about the Cavanagh controversy he's been quiet about Michael Kohn it's it's quite a surprise it's a good thing that he is doing that because his past history has only gotten him in much more trouble than he was in before he said anything so if he keeps quiet it's it's good maybe not for the news but it's a good thing for his legal case let's let's go back in time a moment I remember early on in the Russia investigation President Trump was furious when there was this notion that Robert Muller could start investigating his personal finances he said that was his redline well that's come and gone I remember speaking to a big Trump supporter here in New York after he won who said to me trunk better not go after the intelligence agencies he's run a pretty shaky business all these years he doesn't want them to look into that well now that we know Cohen is cooperating he's cooperating with New York state authorities and remember they've got an ongoing investigation into the Trump Organization meeting the company into the trunk foundation so that would directly impact Ivanka Don junior Eric how significant would that be yeah that could be huge I mean there's a couple different sort of scopes here right there's the scope that Muller was given by the Department of Justice which is fairly narrow right it's the Russia potential Russian investigation anything related but the New York AG and even the Southern District of New York which is part of DOJ is not limited to that and that's trumps everything Trump has been a politician for what three years his business empire his name that's his world yeah and there's nothing to prevent either of those offices from charging him and I think if they do end up developing charges financial fraud tax fraud on the Trump org on his children on Jared Kushner I think you're gonna see some pretty strong reactions but there's not a heck of a lot he can do in that case thank you both very much
