an NDP minister stood up in the legislature open up his Bible and started using it to criticize Jason Kenney for his Catholic faith and Old Testament Jewish laws on the record this bigotry happened two weeks ago when the mainstream media never really told you how bad it was Richard fian is another NDP social worker turned government minister he's the current MLA for Edmonton Rutherford and he is the Minister of indigenous relations and he did something truly disgusting that you didn't really hear about during the debate on bill 24 now bill 24 or as it's better known an act to support gay straight alliances passed on November 15th that bill makes it illegal for teachers to inform parents if their children are in a Gay Straight Alliance I've got so many problems with this law the intention of the bill is well-meaning I guess to protect kids from parents who are not accepting of their own LGBTQ child but it also seems all parents especially religious ones will be hostile instead and punishes and alienates good well-meaning parents from their children and I certainly don't like the idea that the Alberta government is not only encouraging but enforcing secrets between teachers and children apart from their parents it's creepy and it's a violation of my rights as a parent and secondly but probably my most pressing issue that I have with bill 24 is that it is commonly understood that children who are struggling with their sexual identities are at exponentially higher risk for suicide and self-harm in fact it's a statistic that's often cited by the left to justify the formation of gay straight alliances international research suggests that between 77 and 83 percent of trans people have seriously considered ending their lives and between 32 and 54 percent of trans people have attempted suicide and 44 percent of respondents to the same study admitted self-harm but now under bill 24 if a child is in a gay straight alliance and struck with their sexual identity it's a legal for a teacher to tell the parents of that child that their child is struggling with an issue that will make them at greater risk for suicide and self-harm stripping parents of the right and the ability to protect their own child from themselves it's an absolutely dangerous negligence on behalf of the Alberta government now that's why issue with the law let me tell you about my issue with Richard Feehan and his defense of this reprehensible law Feehan stood up in the legislature cracked open his Bible during the final debate on bill 24 and started attacking Jason Kenney for his Catholicism just watch this there are many things that are different between me and the Honorable Jason Kenney but I can tell you one of the things that's different is I actually finished my theology degree what is the basis for this kind of you know anger toward homosexuality and I realize that it has nothing to do with the New Testament take us back to the Old Testament and take us back to Leviticus where it is suggested in Leviticus 18:22 that one should not a quote do not have sexual relations with a man as one does with a woman might add in here Leviticus 19:27 in case you're following along in your own Bibles did you catch that part where Feehan told the opposition MLAs to follow along in their Bibles as though believing in a parent's right to know what the heck their kids are doing in a day is somehow Bible something craziness instead of just good old-fashioned responsible parenting the laughter and mockery from the NDP benches is revolting Feehan speech was grossly anti-catholic as it started off directed at Jason Kenney which should really come as no surprise from the NDP they have repeatedly attacked mainstream Catholics and mainstream Catholic beliefs for at least the last two years treating Catholics as though there's some sort of fundamentalist fringe wackos it's being attack after attack after attack on Catholic values the rights of Catholic parents over their own children and the rights of Catholic parents to dictate the sort of education their own children will receive it's a deep entrenched anti-catholic bigotry in the NDP government it's undeniable no other faith is on their radar this way but Feehan speech was also very anti-jewish in the way that Feehan mocked and laughed at the laws of the Jewish Old Testament not snickering laughing out loud like jackals in the legislature of all places it's anti-semitic let's do a little thought experiment here let's play replace the religion here for a second so we can get a better perspective on what just transpired in the legislature can you imagine the outrage from the left or the mainstream media if some can servant of politicians stood up in the legislature and opened up a Koran and started berating a Muslim politician for his private interpretation of his own holy book and now imagine the conservative MLAs laughing and mocking the Quran as it was read aloud it would be an Islamophobic hate crime obviously and there would be pitchforks torches apologies and actual resignations but since this was a Catholic being attacked for their Catholic faith and the Jewish laws of the Old Testament being mocked it's perfectly acceptable no one cares and no rightful accusations of bigotry are being leveled at Feehan for the from the usual defenders of supposed tolerance let's do one more little thought experiment imagine if that scary Catholic Jason Kenny stood up and started reading from his Bible as a defense for any law that adjacent can United conservative government wanted to pass the shrieking from the left about how we need to keep religion and politics separate would be deafening but when Feehan did it there was laughter and even applause from the NDP benches the left is always crying about how religion is private and how it needs to stay out of the houses of government but they don't really mean that I mean how could they feel that way when they feel justified to stand up in the legislature and use their own religion to attack another's with complete and total impunity the left and especially the NDP are perfectly fine with religion in public places and in government just not my religion or anyone elses that doesn't fall in line with their pick and choose cafeteria version of religious faith for the rebel media I'm Shiela gun reads it's the Christmas season and yet many Christians in former isis-held territories do not have a place to worship the birth of Christ their churches and villages destroyed by Islamic extremists but we're doing what we can we've already helped raise nearly a quarter of a million dollars for Christian relief efforts in the region if you can help us go to save the Christians calm
