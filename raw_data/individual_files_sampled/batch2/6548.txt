right-wing Christian pastor Hank Cunha Minh made some really creepy comments about God and Trump that I had to share with you if President Trump God spoke to me about him I said tell me about him he said Hank he's a work in progress I said what do you mean he said he's working at some things that you know not of and some is none of your business and he's progressing I said he's progressing he said that's right I know the heart you don't God is trying to put things in order and can I tell you something this you may not like I cried out to God I said God how long is this gonna last you said it's gonna last through the rest of this term and then you'll see in 2020 things will begin to shift things will begin to change and he said as David was a man of war so there are certain things that is on this president that I'm requiring nothing he's a man after God's heart I'm not saying that as we can him in God but I'm saying David was a man of war and David was always at war this president has been called and appointed by God whether you like it whether you agree with it to be at war with some of these cultural things like it's okay to have man with man woman with woman it's okay they say to push God out of our schools you forgot what we almost got elected in this land I always struggle to determine whether or not these people mean what they say and believe it or if their total charlatans and they're just playing a trick and playing a game and doing it to try to get rich it's hard to figure out I think you have to go on a case-by-case basis with these people but look at some of the arguments he made there it's always so mighty convenient because they say stuff like well God spoke to me about Trump and it turns out God tells me he totally agrees with my politics I mean that's anybody could play that game man what a stupid trick oh yeah I spoke to God and God told told me he wants Medicare for all and he wants to end the wars which by the way if we're talking about Jesus your God well most of that New Testament is all hippie dippie lovey-dovey stuff so he probably would want to end the wars and you probably would want Medicare for all but that's not the point because I don't need to use those stupid tricks to try to push for the policies I prefer because they're already popular and because they're really solid logical arguments in favor of doing those policies but these guys it's like what a massive shortcut in their arguments in the political sphere it's just like oh so I spoke to God and it turns out God says I'm awesome Trump is awesome and everything that we want to implement is what should be implemented and everything that the other side wants to implement it's like the devil that's behind that stuff so yeah we should do what I want to do it's so lazy and it's so disingenuous and it's so smug and do you really believe it I mean if you really believe it it's almost scary because it's borderline paranoid schizophrenia eyes I spoke out he was at mimicking like he had a conversation with God dude you're a dude you understand that you know what you do you fucking watch football on Sundays that's what you do you wake up you take a shit you fucking eat breakfast you're normal dude you're a normal dude yeah so I was talking to God they're just having a casual conversation what the fuck is wrong with you having a conversation you so you're speaking to somebody who's not there is that what you're doing a wizard in space that's what you're doing jigglypuff in space is who you're talking to and then the scariest part is oh just like David's a man of war for God Trump is a man of war for God Trump is a man of war for God that sounds dangerously close to Allahu Akbar I will wage a war for God we can have a term for that and call it say a jihad and he's saying oh yeah cuz he's got to fight back against the cultural fucking I mean abortion and engage getting married gross unbelievable man just take the abortion as you wish he go he goes on in that clip to give him more detail you didn't see it there but he does go on and talk about Hillary Clinton and abortion uh the Bible is not even against abortion there's a part of the Bible where they talk about how if your wife cheats on you she needs to take drink bitter water and that'll make her miscarry which is an abortion and so the Bible is prescribing that you get an abortion your wife gets an abortion if she cheats on you so they don't even know their own Bible but they make these arguments I know what God wants and gods so pro-life that he was for the Iraq war he's against universal health care but he's uh you know he's against abortion it's so stupid I mean I would expectedly some like consistency from this crowd but there's no consistency and their only argument is hey I might be parent a paranoid schizophrenic and I was speaking to hearing voices in my head and you expect people to take you seriously and be like oh yeah let's listen to this guy he sounds like he's nailing it dude the years not 1957 anymore you know we have the internet the people are reading different sources and trying to think more for themselves and you're out there still doing the old shtick of like God was talking me seriously I mean it totally totally totally just go away
