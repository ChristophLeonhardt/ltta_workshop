stop looking at it as me against you look at it as you are bringing out the very best in me the key thing here is to ask better questions rather than questioning yourself am I good enough and looking at the other person saying what do they have what opportunities are they taken from me a really good question is what can I learn from this individual that will set you up and I see this all the time i see with graduates i see it with somebody who's just got a promotion and they've go into a different level and i see it with let's say an academy players you've just gone into the first team the question is not am I good enough because you're there by default you put yourself in that situation here's a great perspective on this competition because competition in the business world and everywhere stop looking at it as me against you look at it as you are bringing out the very best in me it's almost like taking the pressure off you're not sat on the sideline metaphorically in the business arena go in I hope you make a mistake so I get my opportunity those people are put around you help you go to a different level
