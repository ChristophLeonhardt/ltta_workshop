WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT THESE

69
00:02:07,489 --> 00:02:08,990
KICKED IT IN ORBIT.

70
00:02:08,990 --> 00:02:11,159

00:02:11,159 --> 00:02:14,696
GIULIANI WAS BROUGHT IN TO BRING

72
00:02:14,696 --> 00:02:15,764
MUELLER INVESTIGATION, BROUGHT

73
00:02:15,764 --> 00:02:17,799
INTO CHANGE THAT KIND OF

74
00:02:17,799 --> 00:02:18,333
CAMPAIGN AGAINST THE

75
00:02:18,333 --> 00:02:19,034
WHITE HOUSE.

76
00:02:19,034 --> 00:02:20,268
I THINK THAT TY COBB HAD A VIEW

77
00:02:20,268 --> 00:02:21,403
THAT YOU DEALT WITH THE

78
00:02:21,403 --> 00:02:23,071
INVESTIGATION AND HE TRIED TO

79
00:02:23,071 --> 00:02:23,438
COOPERATE.

80
00:02:23,438 --> 00:02:25,373
YOU AGREED TO TESTIFY.

81
00:02:25,373 --> 00:02:27,375
AND THEN THE GIULIANI APPROACH

82
00:02:27,375 --> 00:02:28,076
SEEMS TO BE LET'S FIGHT IT IN

83
00:02:28,076 --> 00:02:29,678
THE STREETS AND NOT IN THE

84
00:02:29,678 --> 00:02:31,613
COURTROOM, LET'S FIGHT IT OUT ON

85
00:02:31,613 --> 00:02:32,481
CABLE TV AND PUBLIC OPINION.

86
00:02:32,481 --> 00:02:34,382
I THINK THAT THEY ARE LAYING THE

87
00:02:34,382 --> 00:02:35,851
GROUNDWORK FOR IF THERE IS A

88
00:02:35,851 --> 00:02:37,018
VERY NEGATIVE REPORT BY THE

89
00:02:37,018 --> 00:02:38,019
SPECIAL COUNSEL OR AN

90
00:02:38,019 --> 00:02:39,221
INDICTMENT, THAT THEY ARE GOING

91
00:02:39,221 --> 00:02:40,455
TO TRY TO UNDERLINE THE

92
00:02:40,455 --> 00:02:42,557
CREDIBILITY OF THE FBI OF THE

93
00:02:42,557 --> 00:02:44,025
COURT TO THE INVESTIGATION.

94
00:02:44,025 --> 00:02:46,361
>> John: I SPOKE TO HIM ABOUT

95
00:02:46,361 --> 00:02:47,095
THIS MIDNIGHT ON WEDNESDAY AFTER

96
00:02:47,095 --> 00:02:49,197
HE MADE THE COMMENTS, I SAID,

97
00:02:49,197 --> 00:02:50,031
WHY DID YOU DO THIS?

98
00:02:50,031 --> 00:02:52,200
I SAID TO YOU HAVE SOME

99
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:54,069
REASONABLE EXPECTATION THAT

100
00:02:54,069 --> 00:02:56,171
PROSECUTORS RATED MICHAEL

101
00:02:56,171 --> 00:02:57,172
COHEN'S HOME HAVE EVIDENCE?

102
00:02:57,172 --> 00:02:59,608
>> HE SAID, NO, NOBODY KNOWS

103
00:02:59,608 --> 00:03:01,610
WHAT WAS RECEIVED FROM MICHAEL

104
00:03:01,610 --> 00:03:03,111
COHEN'S OFFICE, BUT COHEN KNOWS.

105
00:03:03,111 --> 00:03:05,013
YOU HAVE TO WONDER IF THEY HAVE

106
00:03:05,013 --> 00:03:05,580
BANK RECORDS.

107
00:03:05,580 --> 00:03:09,150
>> OBVIOUSLY POLITICAL SPEAKING

108
00:03:09,150 --> 00:03:11,019
IT IS A FIRESTORM RIGHT NOW, BUT

109
00:03:11,019 --> 00:03:12,053
WE ARE NOT TALKING ABOUT

110
00:03:12,053 --> 00:03:12,587
POLITICS.

111
00:03:12,587 --> 00:03:13,288
I THINK THAT WE ARE TALKING

112
00:03:13,288 --> 00:03:16,825
ABOUT A LEGALLY, AND CLEARING

113
00:03:16,825 --> 00:03:18,994
THAT UP FROM A LEGAL STANDPOINT

114
00:03:18,994 --> 00:03:20,161
WAS VERY IMPORTANT FOR THE

115
00:03:20,161 --> 00:03:20,529
PRESIDENT.

116
00:03:20,529 --> 00:03:23,398
IN THE PRESIDENT'S TEAM.

117
00:03:23,398 --> 00:03:24,299
>> John: YOU THINK THIS CLEARS

118
00:03:24,299 --> 00:03:24,833
IT UP?

119
00:03:24,833 --> 00:03:26,768
>> THE FACT THAT HE PAID FOR IT

120
00:03:26,768 --> 00:03:27,502
AS OPPOSED TO SOMEBODY ELSE

121
00:03:27,502 --> 00:03:33,475
PAYING FOR IT AND FEELING TO

122
00:03:33,475 --> 00:03:34,609
FILE THE PROPER DOCUMENTATION,

123
00:03:34,609 --> 00:03:37,579
YES, THAT IS A GOOD THING FOR

124
00:03:37,579 --> 00:03:38,046
THE PRESIDENT.

125
00:03:38,046 --> 00:03:41,616
BUT I ALSO THINK THAT IT

126
00:03:41,616 --> 00:03:42,350
SUGGESTS THAT AT LEAST THE BEST

127
00:03:42,350 --> 00:03:44,185
INFORMATION THAT THE PRESIDENT

128
00:03:44,185 --> 00:03:48,990
HAS IS THE BEST CASE THEY HAVE

129
00:03:48,990 --> 00:03:50,959
AGAINST HIM IS AN FEC VIOLATION.

130
00:03:50,959 --> 00:03:54,095
IS THIS CASE, AND IF THAT IS THE

131
00:03:54,095 --> 00:03:55,697
BEST THAT MUELLER HAS AGAINST

132
00:03:55,697 --> 00:03:57,032
THE PRESIDENT, THAT IS NOT THAT

133
00:03:57,032 --> 00:03:57,299
BAD.

134
00:03:57,299 --> 00:03:59,334
>> John: THERE IS A LITTLE

135
00:03:59,334 --> 00:04:00,702
DETAIL OF OKAY, YOU ARE PAYING

136
00:04:00,702 --> 00:04:01,636
MICHAEL COHEN A RETAINER, DID

137
00:04:01,636 --> 00:04:04,372
YOU KNOW WHERE THE RETAINER WAS

138
00:04:04,372 --> 00:04:04,839
GOING?

139
00:04:04,839 --> 00:04:06,007
IN THE PRESIDENT ON THE WAY TO

140
00:04:06,007 --> 00:04:07,442
DALLAS GAVE US A LITTLE INSIGHT.

141
00:04:07,442 --> 00:04:09,277
LET'S LISTEN.

142
00:04:09,277 --> 00:04:10,979
>> WELL, YOU ARE GOING TO FIND

143
00:04:10,979 --> 00:04:12,013
OUT, BECAUSE WE ARE GOING TO

144
00:04:12,013 --> 00:04:14,916
GIVE A FULL LIST, AND PEOPLE

145
00:04:14,916 --> 00:04:17,851
KNOW, AND VIRTUALLY EVERYTHING

146
00:04:17,851 --> 00:04:18,786
SAID HAS BEEN SAID INCORRECTLY.

147
00:04:18,786 --> 00:04:20,488
AND IT HAS BEEN SAID WRONG OR IT

148
00:04:20,488 --> 00:00:00,000
HAS BEEN COVERED WRONG BY THE
