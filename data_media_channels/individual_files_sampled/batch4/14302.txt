I think you talked about it very well in the book when you are building a building words don't matter the building either stands up or it collapses and that seems to kind of explain a lot about Donald Trump he's not a great speaker he is not a great orator though I will say is a trial lawyer I would be adverse to going against a plaintiff's lawyer who could handle an audience or a jury like Donald Trump and because you know you see Donald Trump get out to get out there and he can connect with people who superficially you would not expect him to be able to connect with yeah I that he has a tremendous feel for the public and he made great efforts to to make himself accessible to the public and to get to know the public initial ones socio-economic Ashland's he would not normally see dealing with the wrestling industry and prizefighting and becoming a you know a reality television star and so on and the end he was you know for 15 years he led that top slot every week except two weeks when American I had led a particularly spectacular course not I mean right from the start he had over 25 million viewers and he never lost them but but when you see yes me have him as his talents as a presenter certainly those hilarious speeches he gives to the faithful in the hinterland are very effective but when he's standing at the podium being the president I think that he speaks actually very well I don't he's not a Roosevelt he's not a Reagan and and he may not be quite as fluent as Clinton or Obama or Nixon her Kennedy but he is a better speaker I'm just we're talking about speaking you're only better speaker than mr. Truman General Eisenhower the bushes Gerald Ford or Lyndon Johnson and and and he speaks with authority does not look or sound implausible as president the way and I don't want to be unkind but the way in science Jimmy Carter did I'm not I'm not discussing Jimmy Carter's merits as a president I personally don't think he was a successful president but that's not the point he did not have the bearing of a president of what you expect of a president of the United States but Donald Trump does he's big he's confident he has a an authoritative voice he's clearly an educated man and and he he is a very effective speaker when when he's in a formal occasion even this thing the other night of presenting his nominee for the position of Justice of the Supreme Court he it was a very elegant ceremony and he handled it well he's not an embarrassment to listen to he and he is look like all of us Kirk we get better at what we do and he's growing into the job and the country's getting used to him too you
