our house<font color="#CCCCCC"> Debra Lopez so from where I am</font>

the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Indy main square let me show you</font>

120
00:10:02,730 --> 00:10:04,920
this main square area so everyone over

121
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:06,180
here they're working on protest signs

122
00:10:06,180 --> 00:10:17,190
and flags sorry you can't<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually see</font>

123
00:10:17,190 --> 00:10:19,260
how big the campus because it's too big

124
00:10:19,260 --> 00:10:21,480
and straight ahead behind these trees on

125
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:23,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">this hill it just climbs this entire</font>

126
00:10:23,250 --> 00:10:26,040
Hill and it goes down straight until

127
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:28,470
another hill I can't see over it so it's

128
00:10:28,470 --> 00:10:30,000
it's seriously huge and one of the most

129
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,380
important things<font color="#CCCCCC"> to know is this isn't</font>

130
00:10:31,380 --> 00:10:33,390
the only protest camp in Brazil this

131
00:10:33,390 --> 00:10:36,870
actually I believe five one of which has

132
00:10:36,870 --> 00:10:39,300
around eight thousand families so you

133
00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:40,500
know what we're hearing they're calling

134
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:43,199
this the people's<font color="#CCCCCC"> Cup they're upset that</font>

135
00:10:43,199 --> 00:10:45,750
so much money is being poured into this

136
00:10:45,750 --> 00:10:48,750
sporting event and not actually going to

137
00:10:48,750 --> 00:10:50,790
the people who need it rent is really

138
00:10:50,790 --> 00:10:52,470
high here in Brazil compared to the

139
00:10:52,470 --> 00:10:55,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">minimum wage people could be spending 75</font>

140
00:10:55,230 --> 00:10:57,029
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> 80 percent of their monthly income</font>

141
00:10:57,029 --> 00:11:00,300
just to rent a place to live and this is

142
00:11:00,300 --> 00:11:02,250
you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> one of the contributing factor</font>

143
00:11:02,250 --> 00:11:04,830
to the favelas so what's what's

144
00:11:04,830 --> 00:11:06,110
interesting what we've learned so<font color="#CCCCCC"> far</font>

145
00:11:06,110 --> 00:11:08,040
shooting down here meeting all of these

146
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:09,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">people and going to these favelas is</font>

147
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:12,030
that they're they're sort of on their

148
00:11:12,030 --> 00:11:14,070
own they feel like they're not you know

149
00:11:14,070 --> 00:11:16,890
i should say<font color="#E5E5E5"> it seems like most parties</font>

150
00:11:16,890 --> 00:11:18,480
including the police the military and

151
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:20,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">the individuals don't feel like they are</font>

152
00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:22,380
a part of the government a part of the

153
00:11:22,380 --> 00:11:24,960
state and these favelas are actually run

154
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:28,830
by gangs the pacification program is

155
00:11:28,830 --> 00:11:30,240
where they're going in and weeding out

156
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:31,950
the gangs and taking off the crime and

157
00:11:31,950 --> 00:11:34,380
what we're told by a major with the

158
00:11:34,380 --> 00:11:35,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">military is that they're trying to make</font>

159
00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:37,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">the people closer to the state they're</font>

160
00:11:37,050 --> 00:11:38,790
trying to gentrify these neighborhoods

161
00:11:38,790 --> 00:11:40,560
and make them you know more official

162
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:44,280
more officially part of the country but

163
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:45,900
you know again<font color="#E5E5E5"> I can just I look from</font>

164
00:11:45,900 --> 00:11:47,400
here<font color="#CCCCCC"> and then I'm just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> speechless at how</font>

165
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:49,200
massive this is because<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know for</font>

166
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:50,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">those that are watching who know the</font>

167
00:11:50,850 --> 00:11:54,180
work that I've done with with covering a

168
00:11:54,180 --> 00:11:55,350
lot of these protests and seeing all

169
00:11:55,350 --> 00:11:57,120
these occupations from Occupy Wall

170
00:11:57,120 --> 00:12:00,150
Street to occupy gezi and even in Kiev

171
00:12:00,150 --> 00:12:02,730
I've never<font color="#E5E5E5"> seen</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> anything so large and</font>

172
00:12:02,730 --> 00:12:05,540
you know what's<font color="#CCCCCC"> interesting is that as</font>

173
00:12:05,540 --> 00:12:07,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">you know when you look at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> from the</font>

174
00:12:07,410 --> 00:12:09,270
surface<font color="#E5E5E5"> it seems a bit disorganized but</font>

175
00:12:09,270 --> 00:12:11,760
there's there's cleverly there's paths

176
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:15,089
you know the<font color="#CCCCCC"> the tents are numbered it's</font>

177
00:12:15,089 --> 00:12:16,860
seriously one of the most<font color="#E5E5E5"> interesting</font>

178
00:12:16,860 --> 00:12:18,420
things you know they've really put a lot

179
00:12:18,420 --> 00:12:20,730
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> work into this and you know if you</font>

180
00:12:20,730 --> 00:12:22,830
ask me personally I think it comes<font color="#E5E5E5"> from</font>

181
00:12:22,830 --> 00:12:24,450
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> work that's been done with the</font>

182
00:12:24,450 --> 00:12:27,030
favelas you know oftentimes the people

183
00:12:27,030 --> 00:12:28,440
who go there we'll just decide to<font color="#E5E5E5"> start</font>

184
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:30,540
building<font color="#CCCCCC"> it somewhere in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> some point in</font>

185
00:12:30,540 --> 00:12:31,560
the favela they'll start putting it

186
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:33,089
together and there are people with

187
00:12:33,089 --> 00:12:35,820
construction experience so they build on

188
00:12:35,820 --> 00:12:40,740
top of<font color="#E5E5E5"> each other yep they have a bit</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

189
00:12:40,740 --> 00:12:43,950
a experience with setting up you know

190
00:12:43,950 --> 00:12:47,130
<font color="#CCCCCC">basically low-cost living situations but</font>

191
00:12:47,130 --> 00:12:48,690
this is a protest camp and these people

192
00:12:48,690 --> 00:12:51,690
they feel<font color="#CCCCCC"> like the workers are being</font>

193
00:12:51,690 --> 00:12:54,000
left homeless meanwhile you've got the

194
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,500
world<font color="#E5E5E5"> cup</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the largest sporting event in</font>

195
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:56,730
the world happening<font color="#E5E5E5"> in their backyard</font>

196
00:12:56,730 --> 00:12:58,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">and I guess the general sentiment that</font>

197
00:12:58,830 --> 00:13:01,440
we've seen<font color="#E5E5E5"> from the people down here is</font>

198
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:04,560
that the world's biggest party is coming

199
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:05,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">to their back door and they're not</font>

200
00:13:05,490 --> 00:13:07,589
<font color="#CCCCCC">invited from</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the people being told they</font>

201
00:13:07,589 --> 00:13:10,589
can't sell you know concessions or have

202
00:13:10,589 --> 00:13:13,410
their stores run near the<font color="#E5E5E5"> stadiums to</font>

203
00:13:13,410 --> 00:13:15,330
the people who can't even<font color="#E5E5E5"> afford to</font>

204
00:13:15,330 --> 00:13:16,140
attend

205
00:13:16,140 --> 00:13:18,420
but now that we've got through that part

206
00:13:18,420 --> 00:13:20,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">I want to try and walk through but again</font>

207
00:13:20,310 --> 00:13:23,040
we might we might not be able to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get a</font>

208
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:24,450
strong signal once we go down into<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

209
00:13:24,450 --> 00:13:25,740
camp what I definitely want to give it a

210
00:13:25,740 --> 00:13:27,660
shot so for those that<font color="#E5E5E5"> are watching I</font>

would be pretty cool if i can show you

223
00:13:56,250 --> 00:13:58,080
what it's like to be down here on the

224
00:13:58,080 --> 00:14:00,120
ground but if it cuts out you know I

225
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:03,300
apologize<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're going to do it so so you</font>

226
00:14:03,300 --> 00:14:04,440
can see<font color="#CCCCCC"> that these are these are</font>

227
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:07,830
numbered and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm going to try to I don't</font>

228
00:14:07,830 --> 00:14:08,880
want I don't want to look<font color="#E5E5E5"> into any of</font>

229
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:10,860
these senses or people's homes but we

230
00:14:10,860 --> 00:14:12,930
were told by the organizers up here that

231
00:14:12,930 --> 00:14:14,280
they you know they welcome the press and

232
00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:15,690
they want everyone to see you know

233
00:14:15,690 --> 00:14:24,270
what's going on<font color="#E5E5E5"> here so they also</font>

234
00:14:24,270 --> 00:14:25,770
mentioned just second before their hope

235
00:14:25,770 --> 00:14:33,450
they're hoping for toilets I can see

236
00:14:33,450 --> 00:14:34,560
it's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> up and down a little bit but</font>

237
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:36,450
this is this is a this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is really amazing</font>

238
00:14:36,450 --> 00:14:38,670
and I think there's a there<font color="#E5E5E5"> are a lot of</font>

239
00:14:38,670 --> 00:14:40,500
<font color="#CCCCCC">people here</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> who you know are sort of</font>

240
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:43,800
being left in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the dust and and you know</font>

241
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:45,630
are just<font color="#E5E5E5"> sort of reclaiming space so</font>

242
00:14:45,630 --> 00:14:47,580
we've heard<font color="#CCCCCC"> that they want the world cup</font>

243
00:14:47,580 --> 00:14:52,290
to to you know by<font color="#E5E5E5"> the space and to let's</font>

244
00:14:52,290 --> 00:14:57,840
go<font color="#E5E5E5"> back the other way to you know</font>

245
00:14:57,840 --> 00:15:00,480
basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's about respect in some</font>

246
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:03,030
regards you know I guess it's hard<font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font>

247
00:15:03,030 --> 00:15:05,010
me to put it but this isn't the<font color="#E5E5E5"> only</font>

248
00:15:05,010 --> 00:15:06,960
camp there there are<font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot of people who</font>

249
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:10,340
are occupying spaces around the city

250
00:15:10,340 --> 00:15:13,530
because so much is being poured into a

251
00:15:13,530 --> 00:15:16,110
sporting event in public<font color="#E5E5E5"> funds you know</font>

252
00:15:16,110 --> 00:15:19,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">this stadium that we are not too far</font>

253
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:22,680
away from<font color="#E5E5E5"> the arena Corinthians is a 450</font>

254
00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:26,150
million dollar<font color="#CCCCCC"> stadium and in in Rio</font>

255
00:15:26,150 --> 00:15:30,040
similar problem so you know it's

256
00:15:30,040 --> 00:15:31,149
hard to imagine what<font color="#E5E5E5"> it would be like to</font>

257
00:15:31,149 --> 00:15:33,759
live in the country<font color="#E5E5E5"> where you need</font>

258
00:15:33,759 --> 00:15:35,529
resources the people need resources and

259
00:15:35,529 --> 00:15:36,880
government funding<font color="#CCCCCC"> is available for it</font>

260
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:38,529
tax money is being paid into it but you

261
00:15:38,529 --> 00:15:40,000
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> they go and fund</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this big sporting</font>

262
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,699
event<font color="#E5E5E5"> instead and it's it's easy to see</font>

263
00:15:42,699 --> 00:15:45,490
where a lot of the anger comes from so

264
00:15:45,490 --> 00:15:48,699
in about one month the world cup kicks

265
00:15:48,699 --> 00:15:52,930
off here in Brazil and a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> people</font>

266
00:15:52,930 --> 00:15:55,389
<font color="#E5E5E5">are trying to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> figure out what exactly is</font>

267
00:15:55,389 --> 00:15:57,699
going to happen no one really<font color="#CCCCCC"> knows for</font>

268
00:15:57,699 --> 00:16:01,180
sure but I guess a few things to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be said</font>

269
00:16:01,180 --> 00:16:02,730
are that there's a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of angry people</font>

270
00:16:02,730 --> 00:16:05,649
there are<font color="#CCCCCC"> likely to be protests there's</font>

271
00:16:05,649 --> 00:16:08,680
likely to be a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> fun it's like</font>

272
00:16:08,680 --> 00:16:10,300
likely to be a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of soccer games</font>

273
00:16:10,300 --> 00:16:12,459
playing everything<font color="#E5E5E5"> you'd expect from a</font>

274
00:16:12,459 --> 00:16:14,529
sporting event but when I talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the</font>

275
00:16:14,529 --> 00:16:16,839
locals and ask them will there be so

276
00:16:16,839 --> 00:16:19,690
much higher that protests and riots

277
00:16:19,690 --> 00:16:23,589
occur and I<font color="#E5E5E5"> said a few things a lot of</font>

278
00:16:23,589 --> 00:16:26,130
<font color="#CCCCCC">people love the Brazilian soccer team</font>

279
00:16:26,130 --> 00:16:28,930
when the World Cup happens you see

280
00:16:28,930 --> 00:16:32,290
Brazilian Flags everywhere but this<font color="#CCCCCC"> time</font>

281
00:16:32,290 --> 00:16:34,540
there's<font color="#CCCCCC"> no Brazilian Flags anywhere</font>

282
00:16:34,540 --> 00:16:37,389
that's sort of surprising a lot of the

283
00:16:37,389 --> 00:16:39,250
people we've spoken to because aside

284
00:16:39,250 --> 00:16:40,899
from the fact that they're not putting

285
00:16:40,899 --> 00:16:43,209
<font color="#E5E5E5">up flags no one else is either so I</font>

286
00:16:43,209 --> 00:16:46,089
asked them is it then you know will the

287
00:16:46,089 --> 00:16:47,620
people support the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Brazilian soccer team</font>

288
00:16:47,620 --> 00:16:51,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">you know will it will it end in in chaos</font>

289
00:16:51,160 --> 00:16:52,660
will there be you know protests and

290
00:16:52,660 --> 00:16:54,100
riots in the streets are people really

291
00:16:54,100 --> 00:16:57,970
going to get angry<font color="#CCCCCC"> and I guess the most</font>

292
00:16:57,970 --> 00:17:01,029
important thought is that everyone seems

293
00:17:01,029 --> 00:17:03,370
to joke that look if the Brazilian

294
00:17:03,370 --> 00:17:05,709
soccer team loses after all the money

295
00:17:05,709 --> 00:17:07,869
that was spent all the resources put

296
00:17:07,869 --> 00:17:10,569
into this if they lose people are going

297
00:17:10,569 --> 00:17:14,199
to riot but if the Brazilian soccer team

298
00:17:14,199 --> 00:17:18,490
wins people<font color="#CCCCCC"> should look on a riot so you</font>

299
00:17:18,490 --> 00:17:19,659
know it's hard<font color="#E5E5E5"> to say exactly</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> what will</font>

300
00:17:19,659 --> 00:17:21,069
happen but<font color="#CCCCCC"> that seems to be the joke and</font>

301
00:17:21,069 --> 00:17:24,010
as as difficult as it seems for a lot of

302
00:17:24,010 --> 00:17:27,099
<font color="#CCCCCC">the people who live here a lot of them</font>

303
00:17:27,099 --> 00:17:28,630
just<font color="#CCCCCC"> seem to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be living their lives and</font>

304
00:17:28,630 --> 00:17:31,480
living like people you know we went down

305
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:32,950
to the favelas we met a lot of really

306
00:17:32,950 --> 00:17:35,140
great people really nice people who you

307
00:17:35,140 --> 00:17:36,760
<font color="#CCCCCC">know showed us great hospitality and</font>

308
00:17:36,760 --> 00:17:39,700
took us in and I guess you know one of

309
00:17:39,700 --> 00:17:40,630
