here's the New York Times on this indictment the 37 page indictment handed up by a federal grand jury in Washington amounted to a detailed rebuttal of mr. Trump who has sowed doubts that Russia interfered in the election and dismissed questions about its meddling as fake news first of all that's it that's a half truth right there I mean whether what Trump has been saying repeatedly is this is a witch-hunt because there was no collusion while he was standing next to Putin he said well Putin does deny it but that's not the same as saying it's untrue what he has said his thing about a witch-hunt has been about his gluten all right goes on this is the Times mr. Muller has gathered extensive evidence of contacts between Russia and the Trump campaign this is the New York Times right mr. Trump's eldest son met with a Russian lawyer in hopes of receiving political dirt on mrs. Clinton okay we've gone through that extensively as far as Trump jr. knew this was not a agent of the Russian government it was a Russian but still it was a stupid meeting to took take he got out of it pretty fast one advisor has admitted being tipped off in advance to Russian hacking of democratic emails untrue this is Papadopoulos that they're talking about and he said he was not tipped off in advance he he just said that he knew that they had them and that went to the Australians and they're claiming that that began the investigation almost certainly untrue as well another was in contact with a twitter account used by russian hackers the hell does that mean we're all in contact with a twitter account used by russian hackers a federal judge found problem this is one I love a federal judge found probable cause that a third advisor was an unlawful Russian agent that's the federal that's the FISA guy who was shown the steeled dossier which we now know was complete garbage as Trump said in his press conference he said if the still dossier had anything they'd have released it by now so that's nonsense but again it's creating this noise it's creating this noise that if so much stuff is happening if I pound my fist on the table long enough we're having an earthquake if so much stuff is happening then there must be something going on there's all the smoke you've got the hammer the news media's got the hammer and they make all this noise
