so I'm going to try and convert you to be a conservative right here by basically saying that government is a secondary priority when it comes to creating better communities then when it comes to ensuring communities are safer and smarter and better most of that can be done through conversations between individuals who don't feel like the government is trying to force a particular perspective or trying to get into anybody's pocket or force anything from above the minute one side uses force things get really ugly I think one of the reasons that we've seen such polarization or politics is because people on both sides of the aisle expect government to solve all of their problems if there's a hurricane the Washington Post says it's Trump's fault and if the economy does great the Wright says that's Trump's that's Trump's benefit and in it feels to me like none of this is real but the reality is most of the relationships we have with other folks our relationships we do have one-on-one or in the context of a community that we share together and that doesn't require necessarily legislative input or guys with guns coming to your front door and trying to force you to do things sure well I'm gonna offer you my two cents sure nobody's the end of this you're gonna be a staunch liberal okay let's make it happen this to a rightists year by the way I'm very very thirsty right now my lips are very dry but I can try that if you give me one that says Alex Jones tears and it's pictures of Alex we might be able to agree on that you know it's an intellectual property issue was talked about but so I was in Chicago for a bit and Chicago I think is a strong example of the ways that that liberal idealism has failed in the ways that liberal idealism needs to be there and I'll explain so I was when I say I was in Chicago I was not visiting the bean I was an angle what I was in one of the most violent neighborhoods in the country and I was there with a lot of young people who live in Chicago and who have lost family members almost every friend I have in Chicago has directly lost at least one family member to to gun violence and whereas somebody who disagrees in my disagrees violence utilizing a gun yes yes and I saw I saw some interesting things I saw the negative results of gentrification which I believe can sometimes be positive and sometimes be very negative and I also saw the need for opportunity now my general view is the reason I identify as liberal is in this country to be successful you need to pull up your bootstraps but not everybody has access to the boots and I think that things need to be done in neighborhoods like Chicago where there are a lot of cultural issues but there are also a lot of issues that can't really be solved by fixing the culture there are people in neighborhoods there that have been pushed out of other neighborhoods the South and West Side have very little access to healthy food I know a friend who has to walk almost six miles every day to get food that is very often either expired or very unhealthy and that leads to a lot of obesity which limits certain job opportunities I've seen a lot of people who are on welfare and abuse and a lot of people who are on welfare and can't get a job I think that there are certain things that can be done to you to have the government aid these people and I think there are certain ways that government aid has failed these people so it's it's really something that I need to take an econ class or a finance class or any of those to really fully understand but through my eyes the government as long as we are such a strong country as long as we are a country that should really be serving as a beacon for the rest of the world not just morally but really in in in every sense I think that there are things we can do to help people out
