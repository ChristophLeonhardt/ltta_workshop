1
00:00:06,530 --> 00:00:08,932
>> THIS IS NOT A PARTISAN

2
00:00:08,933 --> 00:00:11,601
MOMENT, IT'S A MORAL MOMENT IN

3
00:00:11,602 --> 00:00:12,302
OUR COUNTRY.

4
00:00:12,303 --> 00:00:13,937
ULTIMATELY, NOT WHETHER HE IS

5
00:00:13,938 --> 00:00:14,904
INNOCENT OR GUILTY, THIS IS NOT

6
00:00:14,905 --> 00:00:18,174
A TRIAL, BUT ULTIMATELY HAS

7
00:00:18,175 --> 00:00:19,108
ENOUGH QUESTIONS BEING RAISED

8
00:00:19,109 --> 00:00:21,911
THAT WE SHOULD NOT MOVE ONTO

9
00:00:21,912 --> 00:00:22,412
ANOTHER CANDIDATE.

10
00:00:22,413 --> 00:00:23,746
>> Tucker: THAT WAS

11
00:00:23,747 --> 00:00:24,480
SENATOR SPARTACUS IN NEW JERSEY

12
00:00:24,481 --> 00:00:26,716
SAYING AS YOU JUST HEARD, IT

13
00:00:26,717 --> 00:00:28,451
DOESN'T REALLY MATTER IF BRETT

14
00:00:28,452 --> 00:00:30,153
KAVANAUGH IS INNOCENT OR GUILTY.

15
00:00:30,154 --> 00:00:32,322
DEMOCRATS SPENT SO LONG

16
00:00:32,323 --> 00:00:33,056
ATTACKING HIM WITHOUT TANGIBLE

17
00:00:33,057 --> 00:00:33,957
EVIDENCE THAT REALLY IS HIS

18
00:00:33,958 --> 00:00:34,691
OBLIGATION TO JUST SUBMIT AND

19
00:00:34,692 --> 00:00:37,327
LET HIS CAREER AND REPUTATION

20
00:00:37,328 --> 00:00:40,330
AND FAMILY BE DESTROYED FOR THE

21
00:00:40,331 --> 00:00:41,130
GOOD OF THE COUNTRY.

22
00:00:41,131 --> 00:00:43,733
ALAN DERSHOWITZ IS A RETIRED LAW

23
00:00:43,734 --> 00:00:45,368
PROFESSOR AND AUTHOR OF THE

24
00:00:45,369 --> 00:00:47,303
BEST-SELLING "THE CASE AGAINST

25
00:00:47,304 --> 00:00:49,639
IMPEACHING TRUMP."

26
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:51,140
DO YOU THINK, PROFESSOR, THAT

27
00:00:51,141 --> 00:00:52,775
THAT'S A FINE STANDARD, IT

28
00:00:52,776 --> 00:00:55,144
DOESN'T MATTER IF HE'S INNOCENT

29
00:00:55,145 --> 00:00:56,946
OR GUILTY, HE SHOULD JUST

30
00:00:56,947 --> 00:00:57,280
SUBMIT.

31
00:00:57,281 --> 00:00:58,181
>> IT SOUNDS VERY FAMILIAR.

32
00:00:58,182 --> 00:01:00,516
WHEN I WAS IN COLLEGE THAT'S

33
00:01:00,517 --> 00:01:02,685
WHAT THEY SAID ABOUT PEOPLE THAT

34
00:01:02,686 --> 00:01:06,656
WERE ACCUSED OF BEING COMMUNIST.

35
00:01:06,657 --> 00:01:08,491
AND IF YOU ANGRILY RESPONDED AND

36
00:01:08,492 --> 00:01:10,994
SAID, YOU ARE NOT, THEN IT'S

37
00:01:10,995 --> 00:01:15,598
JUST A JOB INTERVIEW AND WHAT'S

38
00:01:15,599 --> 00:01:17,333
THE DIFFERENCE IF YOU ARE

39
00:01:17,334 --> 00:01:17,934
INNOCENT OR GUILTY?

40
00:01:17,935 --> 00:01:19,102
THIS GOES ALL THE WAY BACK TO

41
00:01:19,103 --> 00:01:20,336
THE INQUISITION WHERE THEY WOULD

42
00:01:20,337 --> 00:01:22,372
CALL YOU IN FIRST AND MAKE YOU

43
00:01:22,373 --> 00:01:24,941
TESTIFY, AND THEN THEY WOULD

44
00:01:24,942 --> 00:01:26,009
PRESENT THE EVIDENCE.

45
00:01:26,010 --> 00:01:28,344
ONCE YOU ARE ACCUSED OF THE MOST

46
00:01:28,345 --> 00:01:29,979
HEINOUS CRIME IMAGINABLE, IT

47
00:01:29,980 --> 00:01:31,080
TURNS INTO A TRIAL WHERE YOU

48
00:01:31,081 --> 00:01:31,948
HAVE DUE PROCESS.

49
00:01:31,949 --> 00:01:33,950
WHERE THE BURDEN OF PROOF IS ON

50
00:01:33,951 --> 00:01:35,151
THE OTHER SIDE.

51
00:01:35,152 --> 00:01:36,586
WHERE THE EVIDENCE HAS TO BE

52
00:01:36,587 --> 00:01:37,353
CLEAR AND CONVINCING.

53
00:01:37,354 --> 00:01:39,956
IN AMERICA, WE DON'T ALLOW

54
00:01:39,957 --> 00:01:42,558
PEOPLE TO DESTROY OTHER PEOPLES

55
00:01:42,559 --> 00:01:43,960
REPUTATIONS AND CAREERS BASED

56
00:01:43,961 --> 00:01:46,162
UPON INFERENCE OF GUILT, THE WAY

57
00:01:46,163 --> 00:01:47,664
THE ACLU NOW SAYS.

58
00:01:47,665 --> 00:01:49,666
THE ACLU SAYS WE SHOULD PRESUME

59
00:01:49,667 --> 00:01:50,867
GUILT AND NOT INNOCENCE.

60
00:01:50,868 --> 00:01:53,202
>> SO YOU ARE A LIBERAL AND YOU

61
00:01:53,203 --> 00:01:55,104
HAVE LIVED YOUR LIFE IN A

62
00:01:55,105 --> 00:01:55,939
LIBERAL WORLD.

63
00:01:55,940 --> 00:01:58,708
DID ANY OF THEM EVER SAY, I

64
00:01:58,709 --> 00:02:00,743
DON'T AGREE WITH KAVANAUGH, I

65
00:02:00,744 --> 00:02:04,013
HATE TRUMP, BUT I AGREE WITH

66
00:02:04,014 --> 00:02:04,280
YOU.

67
00:02:04,281 --> 00:02:07,350
DUE PROCESS IS WORTH PRESERVING.

68
00:02:07,351 --> 00:02:10,586
>> FOR EXAMPLE TODAY 700 LAW

69
00:02:10,586 --> 00:02:13,156
PROFESSORS SIGNED A LETTER.

70
00:02:13,157 --> 00:02:14,123
AND I REFUSED TO SIGN IT.

71
00:02:14,124 --> 00:02:17,226
SAYING HE NOW NO LONGER HAS

72
00:02:17,227 --> 00:02:17,794
JUDICIAL TEMPERAMENT.

73
00:02:17,795 --> 00:02:19,929
CAN YOU IMAGINE IF THIS WERE A

74
00:02:19,930 --> 00:02:20,663
LIBERAL WHO HAD BEEN APPOINTED

75
00:02:20,664 --> 00:02:21,631
BY A LIBERAL PRESIDENT WHO HAD

76
00:02:21,632 --> 00:02:24,534
BEEN A KEY AND ACTED SIMILARLY?

77
00:02:24,535 --> 00:02:28,738
I DON'T THINK ANY OF THEM WERE

78
00:02:28,739 --> 00:02:29,138
PROFESSORS.

79
00:02:29,139 --> 00:02:31,341
SENATOR BOOKER WHO I LIKE AND

80
00:02:31,342 --> 00:02:33,242
KNOW WAS JUST DEAD WRONG, IT WAS

81
00:02:33,243 --> 00:02:37,513
ALL ABOUT PARTISANSHIP.

82
00:02:37,514 --> 00:02:39,515
IF IT WAS THE DEMOCRATS WHO

83
00:02:39,516 --> 00:02:41,918
OPENED UP THAT CANDIDATE,

84
00:02:41,919 --> 00:02:42,652
EVERYONE WOULD BE BEHAVING THE

85
00:02:42,653 --> 00:02:50,927
OPPOSITE WAY.

86
00:02:50,928 --> 00:02:52,695
AND, WE DEFENDED OUT AL FRANKEN

87
00:02:52,696 --> 00:02:54,030
ON THE SHOW, WHOM I DON'T LIKE

88
00:02:54,031 --> 00:02:55,164
PERSONALLY AND I HATE HIS

89
00:02:55,165 --> 00:02:57,166
POLITICS BUT I THINK YOU GOT

90
00:02:57,167 --> 00:02:58,401
SHAFTED FOR THE SAME REASON.

91
00:02:58,402 --> 00:03:01,037
>> AND HE WAS DEFENDED, TOO.

92
00:03:01,038 --> 00:03:03,706
>> HE DESERVE TO BE DEFENDED.

93
00:03:03,707 --> 00:03:04,841
YOU WERE QUOTED IN A RECENT

94
00:03:04,842 --> 00:03:09,345
PIECE SAYING THAT JULIE

95
00:03:09,346 --> 00:03:11,147
SWETNICK'S LAWYER HAD AN

96
00:03:11,148 --> 00:03:12,348
OPPORTUNITY TO WITHDRAW HIS

97
00:03:12,349 --> 00:03:12,915
STATEMENT.

98
00:03:12,916 --> 00:03:14,617
>> THERE ARE ETHICAL AND BAR

99
00:03:14,618 --> 00:03:16,185
RULES THAT SAY WHEN YOU SEND AN

100
00:03:16,186 --> 00:03:17,020
AFFIDAVIT EVEN TO CONGRESS AND

101
00:03:17,021 --> 00:03:18,187
HE LATER LEARNED THAT THERE ARE

102
00:03:18,188 --> 00:03:20,723
THINGS IN THE AFFIDAVIT THAT ARE

103
00:03:20,724 --> 00:03:22,725
FALSE, YOU HAVE A CONTINUING

104
00:03:22,726 --> 00:03:24,560
OBLIGATION TO WITHDRAW THE

105
00:03:24,561 --> 00:03:25,528
AFFIDAVIT.

106
00:03:25,529 --> 00:03:27,363
YOU CANNOT ALLOW AN AFFIDAVIT TO

107
00:03:27,364 --> 00:03:28,765
REMAIN ON THE RECORD, IF YOU

108
00:03:28,766 --> 00:03:30,867
HAVE INFORMATION SUGGESTING ITS

109
00:03:30,868 --> 00:03:32,702
CAUSE.

110
00:03:32,703 --> 00:03:35,338
IN ANY REASONABLE LAWYER, SAYS

111
00:03:35,339 --> 00:03:36,739
YOU CAN'T ANY LONGER ACCEPT

112
00:03:36,740 --> 00:03:39,142
WHAT'S IN THAT AFFIDAVIT.

113
00:03:39,143 --> 00:03:41,677
SHE HAS TO BE INVESTIGATED

114
00:03:41,678 --> 00:03:42,745
INDEPENDENTLY OF THE BACKGROUND

115
00:03:42,746 --> 00:03:44,347
CHECK, CRIMINALLY INVESTIGATED,

116
00:03:44,348 --> 00:03:45,948
TO SEE IF SHE DELIBERATELY AND

117
00:03:45,949 --> 00:03:48,317
WILLFULLY, WITH OR WITHOUT THE

118
00:03:48,318 --> 00:03:50,353
AID OF ANYONE ELSE MADE A

119
00:03:50,354 --> 00:03:51,287
DECISION JUST TO FRAME SOMEBODY

120
00:03:51,288 --> 00:03:53,156
FOR SOMETHING HE HAD NOTHING TO

121
00:03:53,157 --> 00:03:53,956
DO WITH.

122
00:03:53,957 --> 00:03:54,957
THE EVIDENCE SEEMS TO SUGGEST

123
00:03:54,958 --> 00:03:56,692
THAT THEY NEVER KNEW EACH OTHER,

124
00:03:56,693 --> 00:03:58,161
THEY WERE YEARS APART AND

125
00:03:58,162 --> 00:03:58,861
OPERATING IN DIFFERENT CIRCLES

126
00:03:58,862 --> 00:04:00,963
AND IT WOULDN'T SURPRISE ME IF

127
00:04:00,964 --> 00:04:02,165
THE FBI INVESTIGATION AND PROVED

128
00:04:02,166 --> 00:04:03,766
THAT THEY NEVER MET EACH OTHER.

129
00:04:03,767 --> 00:04:05,835
IF THAT TURNS OUT TO BE FACT,

130
00:04:05,836 --> 00:04:08,438
SHE BELONGS IN THE COURT OF LAW,

131
00:04:08,439 --> 00:04:10,406
BEING PROSECUTED WITH THE

132
00:04:10,407 --> 00:04:14,877
PRESUMPTION OF INNOCENCE AND A

133
00:04:14,878 --> 00:04:15,244
DEFENDER.

134
00:04:15,245 --> 00:04:15,945
BUT IF THE EVIDENCE SHOWS THAT

135
00:04:15,946 --> 00:04:18,614
SHE COMMITTED PERJURY, PRISON.

136
00:04:18,615 --> 00:04:19,715
>> Tucker: WHILE.

137
00:04:19,716 --> 00:04:21,084
>> YOU KNOW WHY?

138
00:04:21,084 --> 00:04:22,852
IT'S SO IMPORTANT TO PROTECT

139
00:04:22,853 --> 00:04:25,321
PEOPLE AGAINST BEING, BUT ALSO

140
00:04:25,322 --> 00:04:26,889
PROTECT THEM FROM BEING

141
00:04:26,890 --> 00:04:28,825
WILLFULLY AND FALSELY ACCUSED OF

142
00:04:28,826 --> 00:04:29,525
RATE.

143
00:04:29,526 --> 00:04:31,427
IT'S A VERY SERIOUS CRIME, AND

144
00:04:31,428 --> 00:00:00,000
WE HAVE TO PAY ATTENTION TO
