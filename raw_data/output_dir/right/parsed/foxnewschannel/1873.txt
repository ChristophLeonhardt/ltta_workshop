TODD: BACK WITH A FOX NEWS
ALERT, THE STAGE SET FOR THE
HIGH-STAKES SUMMIT WITH NORTH
KOREA WHICH WE KNOW IS HAPPENING
JUNE 12TH IN SINGAPORE.
THE PRES. SAYING THIS WON'T BE
ANOTHER IRAN DEAL.
WHAT DOES EACH SITE HAVE TO GIVE
TO GET WHAT THEY WANT?
JIM, YESTERDAY WAS A DAY OF
CELEBRATION, TODAY BACK TO
BUSINESS.
WHO WANTS WHAT?
>> Reporter: LET ME GET THE
CRYSTAL BALL OUT.
YOU NEVER MAKE A POLICY ON NORTH
KOREA THINKING YOU KNOW WHAT THE
NORTH KOREANS ARE DOING, THEY
TOLD PEOPLE WE DON'T KNOW WHAT
KIM IS GOING TO DO.
HE DOESN'T CONSULT FOREIGN
POLICY APPARATUS AND HE WILL GO
IN THE ROOM AND DO WHAT HE
WANTS.
WE DON'T KNOW IF THAT IS TRUE
BUT THE ADMINISTRATION WALKS IN
THE DOOR EXPECT EVERYTHING LIKE
A HANDSHAKE AND SMILED TO LET'S
DO REGULAR AND DO A BIG DEAL,
THEY HAVE TO BE PREPARED FOR ALL
OF THAT.
TODD: USING YOUR FOREIGN-POLICY
EXPERIENCE CAN YOU ESTIMATE WHAT
HE WANTS?
WHAT NORTH KOREA WILL DEMAND?
>> THE NORTH KOREAN COMMENTS
LIKE HIM COULD WALK IN BUT
EVERYTHING ON THE TABLE, BUT IF
YOU LISTEN TO THE RHETORIC IT IS
ALL STUFF WE HEARD BEFORE.
WE WENT THE US FORCES TO LEAVE
THE KOREAN PENINSULA AND WE WILL
GIVE UP NUCLEAR WEAPONS.
EVEN IF THAT HAPPENS, THE
PROBLEM IS YOU HAVE A
CONVENTIONAL FORCE PROBLEM, THE
NORTH KOREANS HAVE A BIGGER
MILITARY THAN THE SOUTH KOREANS.
IT WOULD BE AN IMBALANCE THAT
SOUTH KOREA WOULD NEVER ACCEPT.
THAT IS AN ISSUE.
A PEACE TREATY WITH THE US IS A
NOTHING BURGER.
AT THE END OF THE DAY DOES IT
CHANGE THE CORRELATION OF
FORCES?
I AM NOT SURE IF THAT IS
SOMETHING AT THE BEGINNING OR
END OF THE PROCESS.
THE UNITED STATES RECOGNIZING
NORTH KOREA COME A NOTHING
BURGER BECAUSE HERE IS THE DEAL.
IF YOU DON'T WANT ANOTHER IRAN
DEAL, MAXIMUM PRESSURE WITH
FORCES AND SANCTIONING UNTIL
NORTH KOREA IS NO LONGER A
THREAT.
A LOT OF THOSE THINGS YOU CAN'T
DO UNTIL THEY HAVE GIVEN UP
NUCLEAR WEAPONS.
TODD: THE PRES. WILL BE A
HARDLINER ON SO MANY ISSUES BUT
IS THERE ANY WIGGLE ROOM ON OUR
SIDE AND IF SO WHERE IS IT?
>> THERE IS ALWAYS WIGGLE ROOM,
DIPLOMATIC RECOGNITION, THE
PEACE TREATY, YOU CAN DO THOSE
THINGS AND NOT GIVE UP GROUND
AND WHERE NORTH KOREA AND IRAN
ARE BOOKENDS, SAY I'M WALKING
AWAY FROM THE TABLE WITH IRAN
BECAUSE THE DEAL IS NOT TOUGH
ENOUGH AND GIVE A SWEETHEART
DEAL TO NORTH KOREA.
TALK ABOUT CREDIBILITY
VAPORIZING IN A SECOND.
ON THE FLIPSIDE THE IRANIANS ARE
WATCHING, IF YOU ARE TOUGH ON
NORTH KOREA AND NORTH KOREA
COMES TO THE TABLE WITH A
CREDIBLE DEAL THAT PUTS PRESSURE
ON THE URANIAN'S.
TODD: I LOOKED AT PREDICTIONS,
THIS IS A MUCH MORE HIGHER STEAK
SITUATION.
ULTIMATELY AT THE END OF THE
DAY, JUNE 12TH AND BEYOND, WHAT
DO YOU THINK A POSSIBLE DEAL
BETWEEN THE US AND NORTH KOREA
LOOKS LIKE?
>> I'M A POLICY ANALYST.
ANYBODY WHO GIVES YOU A
PREDICTION ON THIS IS AN IDIOT.
THIS IS A BIG THING FOR MARKETS.
PEOPLE EXPECT A REYKJAVI
PEOPLE EXPECT A REYKJAV√çK
MOMENT, THE PRESIDENT COULD GO
AND THEY COULD EXTEND TALKING
INTO THE SECOND DAY AND COULD
TALK ABOUT BIG THINGS AND THEY
COULD WALK OUT OF THE DEAL AND
GET NOTHING, BUT THAT IS OKAY
BECAUSE WITH MAXIMUM PRESSURE,
WE DEALT WITH THE SECURITY
THREAT AND IF KIM IS WILLING TO
COME TO THE TABLE NOW HE WILL
COME BACK.
IF THEY WAKE AWAY WITH SOMETHING
CREDIBLE AND IF THEY WALK AWAY
WITH NOTHING IT PROVES WHAT WE
SAID, WE ARE NOT ON A PATH TO
WAR, THERE WILL BE ANOTHER DAY,
DON'T SELL YOUR STOCKS.
TODD: CAN'T BLAME ME FOR TRYING
TO GET
