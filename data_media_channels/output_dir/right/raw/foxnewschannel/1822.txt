1
00:00:07,345 --> 00:00:09,180
>>> IT IS CLEAR TO ME THAT WE

2
00:00:09,180 --> 00:00:12,517
CANNOT PREVENT AN IRANIAN

3
00:00:12,517 --> 00:00:14,719
NUCLEAR BOMB UNDER THE DECAYING

4
00:00:14,719 --> 00:00:17,355
AND ROTTEN STRUCTURE OF THE

5
00:00:17,355 --> 00:00:19,290
CURRENT AGREEMENT.

6
00:00:19,290 --> 00:00:22,827
THE IRAN DEAL IS DEFECTIVE AT

7
00:00:22,827 --> 00:00:24,295
ITS CORE.

8
00:00:24,295 --> 00:00:25,030
>> PAUL: PROM'S DECISION THIS

9
00:00:25,030 --> 00:00:26,998
WEEK TO LEAVE -- PRESIDENT TRUMP

10
00:00:26,998 --> 00:00:28,166
DECISION THIS WEEK TO LEAVE THE

11
00:00:28,166 --> 00:00:30,301
IRAN NUCLEAR ACCORD DRAWING A

12
00:00:30,301 --> 00:00:31,836
MIXED REACTION ON CAPITOL HILL

13
00:00:31,836 --> 00:00:33,838
WITH DEMOCRATS LARGELY

14
00:00:33,838 --> 00:00:34,939
CONDEMNING THE DECISION,

15
00:00:34,939 --> 00:00:37,375
CLAIMING IT COULD TRIGGER A

16
00:00:37,375 --> 00:00:39,477
NUCLEAR CRISIS AND LEAD TO

17
00:00:39,477 --> 00:00:40,812
GREATER TENSIONS IN THE MIDDLE

18
00:00:40,812 --> 00:00:41,112
EAST.

19
00:00:41,112 --> 00:00:42,313
REPUBLICAN RON JOHNSON IS A

20
00:00:42,313 --> 00:00:44,449
MEMBER OF THE SENATE FOREIGN

21
00:00:44,449 --> 00:00:45,050
RELATIONS COMMITTEE.

22

HE JOINS ME FROM MILWAUKEE,

WISCONSIN.

24
00:00:48,486 --> 00:00:50,622
SENATOR, GOOD TO HAVE YOU WITH

25
00:00:50,622 --> 00:00:50,922
US.

26
00:00:50,922 --> 00:00:51,990
THANKS FOR COMING IN.

27
00:00:51,990 --> 00:00:53,358
DO YOU AGREE WITH THE

28
00:00:53,358 --> 00:00:54,259
PRESIDENT'S DECISION ON IRAN?

29
00:00:54,259 --> 00:00:55,260
>> I DO.

30
00:00:55,260 --> 00:00:56,561
THE WORLD IS LESS SAFE BECAUSE

31
00:00:56,561 --> 00:00:59,597
OF THE IRANIAN AGREEMENT THAT

32
00:00:59,597 --> 00:01:01,800
FUNNELED ABOUT $100 BILLION PLUS

33
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:04,536
INTO NOT ONLY THE ECONOMY, BUT

34
00:01:04,536 --> 00:01:07,372
EVEN WORSE, THE MILITARY OF THE

35
00:01:07,372 --> 00:01:08,907
LARGEST STATE SPONSOR OF TERROR

36
00:01:08,907 --> 00:01:11,109
AND WE'VE SEEN HOW THEY USED

37
00:01:11,109 --> 00:01:13,945
THAT MONEY, TO DESTABILIZE

38
00:01:13,945 --> 00:01:16,448
YEMEN, DESTABILIZE SYRIA,

39
00:01:16,448 --> 00:01:19,584
PROVIDE HEZBOLLAH MORE SUPPORT,

40
00:01:19,584 --> 00:01:21,820
ROCKETS IN IS RAM AND THE

41
00:01:21,820 --> 00:01:21,853
ROCKETS IN ISRRAM AND THE

00:01:21,853 --> 00:01:21,886
ROCKETS IN ISRAEM AND THE

43
00:01:21,886 --> 00:01:22,620
ROCKETS IN ISRAEL AND THE DEAL

44
00:01:22,620 --> 00:01:25,156
DID NOTHING TO STOP THEIR

45
00:01:25,156 --> 00:01:28,993
BALLISTIC MISSILE TECHNOLOGY

46
00:01:28,993 --> 00:01:29,694
ADVANCEMENT EITHER.

47
00:01:29,694 --> 00:01:31,029
GETTING OUT OF THIS WILL GIVE US

48
00:01:31,029 --> 00:01:33,431
THE OPPORTUNITY TO RATCHET UP

49
00:01:33,431 --> 00:01:34,466
SANCTIONS AND HOPEFULLY COME UP

50
00:01:34,466 --> 00:01:35,900
WITH A BETTER DEAL.

51
00:01:35,900 --> 00:01:38,636
>> PAUL: ARE YOU RECORD WEED WOR

00:01:38,636 --> 00:01:38,670

>> PAUL: ARE YOU RECORD WEED WOD

58
00:01:40,505 --> 00:01:43,641
ABOUT THE -- WORRIED ABOUT THE

59
00:01:43,641 --> 00:01:45,376
RIFT WITH EUROPE.

60
00:01:45,376 --> 00:01:47,278
YOU COULD HAVE MORE

61
00:01:47,278 --> 00:01:50,882
TRANSATLANTIC TENSIONS.

62
00:01:50,882 --> 00:01:52,217
YOU'RE ALREADY FIGHTING OVER

63
00:01:52,217 --> 00:01:54,552
TARIFFS ON STEEL AND ALUMINUM.

64
00:01:54,552 --> 00:01:55,753
DOES THAT CONCERN YOU AT ALL?

65
00:01:55,753 --> 00:01:57,689
>> WE WANT TO HAVE A STRONG

66
00:01:57,689 --> 00:01:58,890
RELATIONSHIP WITH OUR NATO

67
00:01:58,890 --> 00:02:00,492
ALLIES AND EUROPEAN FRIENDS AS

68
00:02:00,492 --> 00:02:01,526
WELL.

69
00:02:01,526 --> 00:02:03,528
THE WESTERN DEMOCRACY HAS KEPT

70
00:02:03,528 --> 00:02:04,429
PEACE AND SECURITY THROUGHOUT

71
00:02:04,429 --> 00:02:05,163
THE WORLD.

72
00:02:05,163 --> 00:02:06,197
WE NEED TO HANG TOGETHER.

73
00:02:06,197 --> 00:02:07,899
THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS,

74
00:02:07,899 --> 00:02:09,366
THOUGH SAME COUNTRIES, BRITAIN,

75
00:02:09,366 --> 00:02:12,303
FRANCE, GERMANY, NEW FULL WELL

76
00:02:12,303 --> 00:02:13,638
WHEN PRESIDENT OBAMA ENTERED

77
00:02:13,638 --> 00:02:15,540
THIS UNILATERALLY, DID NOT

78
00:02:15,540 --> 00:02:17,475
CONSULT WITH CONGRESS, DID NOT

79
00:02:17,475 --> 00:02:20,111
RATIFY THIS THROUGH THE TREATY

80
00:02:20,111 --> 00:02:20,845
PROCESS, THAT AGREEMENT WAS

81
00:02:20,845 --> 00:02:22,413
WORTH NO MORE THAN THE PAPER IT

82
00:02:22,413 --> 00:02:23,648
WAS WRITTEN ON AND THEY'RE

83
00:02:23,648 --> 00:02:26,184
RECOGNIZING THAT RIGHT NOW.

84
00:02:26,184 --> 00:02:27,585
HOPEFULLY FRENCH PRESIDENT

85
00:02:27,585 --> 00:02:28,586
MACRON IS CERTAINLY TALKING

86
00:02:28,586 --> 00:02:30,021
ABOUT WORKING OUT A BETTER DEAL

87
00:02:30,021 --> 00:02:31,422
AND THAT'S THE BETTER ATTITUDE

88
00:02:31,422 --> 00:02:32,090
TO TAKE.

89
00:02:32,090 --> 00:02:33,858
>> PAUL: IF SUCH A DEAL DID COME

90
00:02:33,858 --> 00:02:36,361
TO FRUITION, ADDING A COUPLE OF

91
00:02:36,361 --> 00:02:37,095
THE PROVISIONS THAT YOU

92
00:02:37,095 --> 00:02:39,597
MENTIONED BEFORE, LIKE THE

93
00:02:39,597 --> 00:02:42,534
SUNSET PROVISION AND INTRUSIVE

94
00:02:42,534 --> 00:02:43,434
INSPECTIONS, DO YOU THINK YOU

95
00:02:43,434 --> 00:02:44,769
GUYS IN THE SENATE WOULD BE ABLE

96
00:02:44,769 --> 00:02:46,004
AND WILLING TO PUT THOSE

97
00:02:46,004 --> 00:02:48,006
PROVISION INTUSE YOUR

98
00:02:48,006 --> 00:02:49,207
LEGISLATION -- PROVISIONS INTO

99
00:02:49,207 --> 00:02:50,508
YOUR LEGISLATION THAT MONITORS

100
00:02:50,508 --> 00:02:53,144
AND CALLS FOR REVIEW OF THE IRAN

101
00:02:53,144 --> 00:02:53,978
NUCLEAR ACCORD?

102
00:02:53,978 --> 00:02:55,947
DO YOU THINK YOU COULD GET

103
00:02:55,947 --> 00:02:56,781
BIPARTISAN SUPPORT TO DO THAT?

104
00:02:56,781 --> 00:02:58,183
>> I GUESS WHAT I WOULD RATHER

105
00:02:58,183 --> 00:02:59,717
DO IS COME UP WITH A NEW DEAL

106
00:02:59,717 --> 00:03:01,419
AND SEND IT THROUGH ADD VOCATION

107
00:03:01,419 --> 00:03:03,454
OF THE SENATE.

108
00:03:03,454 --> 00:03:04,355
HAD PRESIDENT OBAMA DONE THAT,

109
00:03:04,355 --> 00:03:06,090
THE IRANIAN AGREEMENT WOULD HAVE

110
00:03:06,090 --> 00:03:07,592
BEEN FAR BETTER AND MIGHT HAVE

111
00:03:07,592 --> 00:03:08,593
STOOD THE TEST OF TIME.

112
00:03:08,593 --> 00:03:11,129
IT CERTAINLY WOULD HAVE HAD

113
00:03:11,129 --> 00:03:11,663
BIPARTISAN SUPPORT.

114
00:03:11,663 --> 00:03:13,531
THAT'S THE DANGER OF ANY

115
00:03:13,531 --> 00:03:17,368
PRESIDENT ACTING JUNE

116
00:03:17,368 --> 00:03:17,402
PRESIDENT ACTING UUNE

117
00:03:17,402 --> 00:03:17,435
PRESIDENT ACTING UNIE

118
00:03:17,435 --> 00:03:17,802
PRESIDENT ACTING UNILATERALLY

119
00:03:17,802 --> 00:03:19,304
AND NOT GOING THROUGH THE RAT

120
00:03:19,304 --> 00:03:20,505
PHI CASE PROCESS.

121
00:03:20,505 --> 00:03:22,240
-- RATIFICATION PROCESS.

122
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:23,541
I WOULD RATHER SEE PRESIDENT

123
00:03:23,541 --> 00:03:24,576
TRUMP COME UP WITH A NEW DEAL

124
00:03:24,576 --> 00:03:26,277
AND HAVE IT RATIFIED BY THE

125
00:03:26,277 --> 00:03:26,945
SENATE.

126
00:03:26,945 --> 00:03:27,745
>> PAUL: THE SENATE TREATY,

127
00:03:27,745 --> 00:03:31,349
YOU'VE GOT TO HAVE 67 VOTES.

128
00:03:31,349 --> 00:03:33,451
YOU WOULD HAVE TO GET PRESIDENT

129
00:03:33,451 --> 00:03:34,185
TRUMP -- PRESIDENT TRUMP WOULD

130
00:03:34,185 --> 00:03:37,121
HAVE TO GET AN ENORMOUS NUMBER

131
00:03:37,121 --> 00:03:39,691
OF DEMOCRATS TO SIGN ONTO THAT

132
00:03:39,691 --> 00:03:40,225
KIND OF DEAL.

133
00:03:40,225 --> 00:03:49,500
>> DURING THE CORKER CARD YENEN

134
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:51,102
DEBATE, THE FIRST THING WE WOULD

135
00:03:51,102 --> 00:03:53,338
HAVE VOTED ON WOULD HAVE BEEN A

136
00:03:53,338 --> 00:03:53,671
TREATY.

137
00:03:53,671 --> 00:03:56,574
IF THEY UP HELD THE OATH OF

138
00:03:56,574 --> 00:03:57,775
OFFICE, THAT AMENDMENT WOULD

139
00:03:57,775 --> 00:04:00,211
HAVE PASSED 100-0.

140
00:04:00,211 --> 00:04:01,613
WE HAD REPUBLICANS LOBBYING

141
00:04:01,613 --> 00:04:03,081
AGAINST IT, UNFORTUNATELY.

142
00:04:03,081 --> 00:04:05,049
FROM MY STANDPOINT, SOMETHING SO

143
00:04:05,049 --> 00:04:05,950
SIGNIFICANT CERTAINLY IS A

144
00:04:05,950 --> 00:04:08,553
TREATY AND IT SHOULD BE RATIFIED

145
00:04:08,553 --> 00:04:09,821
AND WE WOULD BE IN A BETTER

146
00:04:09,821 --> 00:04:12,890
PLACE TO I DO HAD HE DONE THAT.

147
00:04:12,890 --> 00:04:13,658
>> PAUL: WHAT'S THE MOOD

148
00:04:13,658 --> 00:04:16,461
GENERALLY SPEAKING IN THE SENATE

149
00:04:16,461 --> 00:04:18,062
ABOUT THIS WITHDRAWAL DECISION?

150
00:04:18,062 --> 00:04:19,764
THE DEMOCRATS -- I REMEMBER WHEN

151
00:04:19,764 --> 00:04:21,031
YOU HAD THIS DEBATE.

152
00:04:21,031 --> 00:04:22,834
THERE WAS BIPARTISAN OPPOSITION

153
00:04:22,834 --> 00:04:24,435
EVEN AMONG DEMOCRATS, SOME

154
00:04:24,435 --> 00:04:24,769
OPPOSED.

155
00:04:24,769 --> 00:04:26,170
I THINK CHUCK SCHUMER VOTED

156
00:04:26,170 --> 00:04:30,208
AGAINST IT OR HE WAS OPPOSED TO

157
00:04:30,208 --> 00:04:34,145
IT IN SOME OF THE CRUCIAL VOTES

158
00:04:34,145 --> 00:04:34,612
ON CAPITOL HILL.

159
00:04:34,612 --> 00:04:35,947
NOW DEMOCRATS SAY WE SHOULD STAY

160
00:04:35,947 --> 00:04:36,581
IN ANYWAY.

161
00:04:36,581 --> 00:04:38,149
WHAT'S CHANGED?

162
00:04:38,149 --> 00:04:41,219
>> WELL, THEY CIRCLED THE WAGONS

163
00:04:41,219 --> 00:04:42,553
EVEN BACK THEN TO END UP PASSING

164
00:04:42,553 --> 00:04:46,257
THE CORKER/CARDEN AGREEMENT ACT.

165
00:04:46,257 --> 00:04:48,393
BUT FROM MY STANDPOINT, I THINK

166
00:04:48,393 --> 00:04:50,895
A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE AMBIVALENT.

167
00:04:50,895 --> 00:04:53,464
I COULD HAVE ARGUED THIS BOTH

168
00:04:53,464 --> 00:04:54,799
WAYS, STAY IN THE AGREEMENT, TRY

169
00:04:54,799 --> 00:04:56,067
AND STRENGTHEN IT.

170
00:04:56,067 --> 00:04:57,168
WE'VE ALREADY GIVEN UP ALL OF

171
00:04:57,168 --> 00:05:01,306
OUR LEVERAGE.

172
00:05:01,306 --> 00:05:03,207
THE FICTION OF SNAPBACK

173
00:05:03,207 --> 00:05:04,008
SANCTIONS WAS JUST THAT.

174
00:05:04,008 --> 00:05:05,910
THERE WAS NO WAY TO GET THE

175
00:05:05,910 --> 00:05:06,577
$100 BILLION PLUS BACK.

176
00:05:06,577 --> 00:05:08,212
THERE WAS NO WAY TO PUT IRAN'S

177
00:05:08,212 --> 00:05:10,114
BEHAVIOR BACK IN THE BOTTLE.

178
00:05:10,114 --> 00:05:11,916
SO YOU COULD ARGUE THIS BOTH

179
00:05:11,916 --> 00:05:12,317
WAYS.

180
00:05:12,317 --> 00:05:13,918
BUT I HAVE NO PROBLEM WITH WHAT

181
00:05:13,918 --> 00:05:16,788
PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS DONE,

182
00:05:16,788 --> 00:05:19,090
PARTICULARLY IF WE START

183
00:05:19,090 --> 00:05:21,626
RATCHETING UP SANCTIONS AT THIS

184
00:05:21,626 --> 00:05:22,226
TIME.

185
00:05:22,226 --> 00:05:25,330
PRIME MINISTER NETANYAHU MADE A

186
00:05:25,330 --> 00:05:27,665
STRONG CASE, WHEN YOU SEE

187
00:05:27,665 --> 00:05:28,700
SPONTANEOUS DEMONSTRATIONS IN

188
00:05:28,700 --> 00:05:29,801
IRAN, OBVIOUSLY THE MONEY IS NOT

189
00:05:29,801 --> 00:05:31,402
