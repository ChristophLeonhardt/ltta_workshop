as tradition goes allow me to begin the briefing with the agenda of the Foreign Minister of the Russian Federation Sergei Lavrov on the 16th of March in the capital of the Republic of Kazakhstan the ministers of Foreign Affairs of three countries Russia Iran and Turkey will have a meeting and discuss the matters of coordinating the efforts of the guarantors of the Astana process on promoting the settlement in Syria the format of the event will be different from the classical international formula in Astana because they do not invite the representatives of the Syrian government or the opposition or external observers with the exception of the special representative of the UN general sector on Syria mr. de Mistura and of course we leave this matter on the consideration of Kazakhstan but the participants are supposed to be accepted by the president of Kazakhstan and the ministerial meeting will be preceded by a session of the joint work group and the first session of the work group on the liberation of detained hostages a transfer of bodies of the deceased and a search for those missing in action and if we get any additional information or Corrections on the agenda of the Minister we will inform you later and now let us move on to our main agenda on international relations and politics of the Russian Federation and the current international issues I would like to begin with the recently traditional topic and talk to you about the preparations for the upcoming presidential elections in Russia abroad in the zone of responsibility concerning the work of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and its foreign missions due to the upcoming presidential elections in Russia which as you all know will take place on the 18th of March we would like to draw the attention of the journalists and our citizens going abroad and who will be staying abroad during the vote yes in who will be there in the days of the vote rather because it will take place not only on the 18th of March a number of citizens have an opportunity to vote beforehand if they are brought we've told you about that and the website of the Central Election Committee of the Russian Federation has instructions on how to take part in the vote in case you are abroad and you are Russian citizen and who would like to take note of the information on the vote abroad the official website of the Russian Foreign Ministry has published instructions on voting for Russian citizens who permanent residence or temporary being outside of Russian Federation who leave on private invitations on business or tourist trips and Russians who are going as guests or tourists as well as Russian citizens who are planning to be in transit or run their way on the days of the vote you can find the list of the polling stations outside of the territory of the Russian Federation as well as their contact information including the addresses and phone numbers the hotlines everything has been verified and checked this was a very thorough work involving all our foreign missions the information has been verified and if that is not enough if you have any more questions we are always ready to answer them in a timely manner we call on all the voters who will be staying abroad in these days take a note of this information we always draw your attention to this because unfortunately social networks for some reason perhaps maliciously are not spread the information saying that if a person is on a short trip abroad they will have no opportunity due to the red tape to take part in the vote they say that they have to go to the consular register they have to apply a whole number of documents another myth is that in order to get all required paperwork to work they will spend up to three months this is all not true everything is being done in order to allow them to vote we don't talk about any weeks or months all the detailed instructions on how to vote abroad are published on the official website on the Russian Foreign Ministry and our foreign missions in relevant countries and the website of the Central Election Commission I have for example seen a post on social networks a man was promoting for one of the candidate and said that he would vote for them but on that day they would be in one of the European countries and so unfortunately keeping in mind that the paperwork would require according to some information after several weeks I won't be able to do that no you will everything can be done in a timely and quick manner you only need to have the passport of the Russian citizen I say once again the step-by-step instructions are published on our websites on the 18th of March our country will celebrate an important event the fourth anniversary of the reunification of Russia with Crimea as excuse me of course life has confirmed that the decision made by the people of Crimea during the Crimean referendum in 2014 was right and it was the only way to protect the interests of the population of Crimea and to protect them from the radicalism in Ukraine from those who came to power after a coup d'etat which is being hidden nowadays today the Republic of Crimea and the federal city of Sevastopol are integrated into the Russian political legal and economic space and we would like to emphasize the alizarin of the Western expectations that this reality would change through pressure against Russia the politicized nature of the information campaign confirms the estimations of more than 100 foreign delegations who visited the peninsula in 2017 and once again I say that the estimations and evaluations of the situation Crimea political economical as well as the human rights situation provided through international structures are given by those who have never been to Crimea and in spite of that they use these unverified data and indirect sources in order to publish reports which unfortunately become the basis for taking relevant decisions and declarations including official ones and we say once again and we will keep saying that you are welcome to visit Crimea we are not trying to smoothen the edges we are not trying to embellish the life of Crimea today we want an objective evaluation in particular by those who actually know the life of Crimea today I mean foreign delegations and foreign representatives they all say that the situation is stable and they notice obvious social and economic results in success and progress although much is yet to be done today Crimea has 14 regional national cultural autonomies including two Crimean Tatar autonomous Crimea has a program of Social and Economic Development and the program for Crimea and Sevastopol to 2020 on the sum of 700 billion rubles and there is growing interest in cooperation with Crimea from foreign business and public circles and the confirmation of this trend was the founding of the International Association of Friends of Crimea they were life in Crimea is very rich in 2018 Crimea will have more than 400 public events including official and religious holidays and anniversaries for the people living in the peninsula in January 2018 Crimea was visited by more than 120 thousand tourists and this year a road will open on the carriage bridge Republic of Crimea and the city of Sevastopol it is my opinion that they should be the ones talking about this but keeping in mind that I talk with the journalists who represent foreign audiences I will say this in the name of the foreign ministry the people of Crimea are eager to talk to you directly Crimea and the city of Sevastopol have a bright future they're open to those who want to visit these Russian regions and see for themselves what the situation is like we have had that televised communications with foreign journalists for you and your colleagues from Crimea representatives of NGOs we organize press tours and trips and we are ready to organize ad hoc events on your requests and the most important thing is that no one is willing to embellish the situation there we all want an objective look at the situation in Crimea and on the lives of the people there come there talk to them and draw your own conclusions but do not produce fakes and unverified information now moving on to the situation in Syria - the irregular information provided by the Defense Ministry we also have our own information to add in particular on the situation in East gouta in response to the daily shellings of the central districts of Damascus by terrorists who are in East gouta the Syrian army has began a large-scale offensive in this rural region in order to eliminate the security threat Russia does not consider this counter-terrorist operation as contradicting the recently adopted resolution 24:01 by the UN Security Council and suppose the fight against terrorists in East gouta by the actions of East's Air Force 0.2 of this resolution reaffirms that the cessation of hostilities does not concern the military operations against Isis al-qaeda al-nusra and other terrorist groups which are claimed as terrorist by the UN Security Council in coordination with the Syrian authorities the Russian military it takes all the necessary measures aimed at avoiding victims among the severe population which I used as a living shield by the terrorists we provide them with food and the medications through the UN humanitarian convoys we evacuate the victims and those who have injuries and help those who require medical aid and on the 5th of March we have assisted the Human Terrain convoy of the UN to the largest town of East guta the town of Duma the convoy has delivered food enough to provide living for 27,000 people during a month while the self-proclaimed representatives of the Opposition who are well beyond is good make their declarations on the supposed preparation of the armed groups in the Enclave to comply with the resolution 24:01 the terrorists working on the ground continue to undermine the humanitarian poles is established at the initiative of Russia and carried out by the Syrian military they continue shelling the humanitarian corridors meant for evacuating the injured and for escaping the population wishing to leave the counter-terrorist operation zone according to Russia's estimations the responsibility for the hostilities happening is tuta and the deaths and sufferings of people lies on the terrorists and dolls field commanders who instead of using these opportunities that have been opened after the establishment of the de-escalation zones and instead of complying with the agreements in Cairo in 2017 on the disengagement simply made an arrangement with al-nusrah turning into their own weapon and the criticisms from a number of Western capitals on this supposed indiscriminate strikes by the Syrian army in East guta once again as always have no proof their absurd from the point fear of logic and accusing Damascus of using poisonous substances do not serve the interests of seizing the hostilities and bloodshed and saving the civilians in the Enclave they only help those who conspired with the terrorists breeding contempt and helps that the Syrian government's this size earnest to stop the threat of terrorists can be broken that is not true that is a mistake that's a false evaluation their perverted impression of the resolution 2401 only shows that we should continue uncompromised fight against terrorism in all its manifestation their calculations are simply criminal in nature I would like to draw your attention to the consequences of the operation on conquering Raqqa the operation was carried out by the us-led coalition and we are still concerned about the situation in this city and within our contribution to the resolution 24:01 of the UN Security Council and that no active efforts to promote the improvement of human hair and situation in the whole territory of Syria Russia has put forth an initiative to create and establish an international valuation mission which would provide an independent and impartial estimation of the current situation and this Lodge Syrian City the city which is the center of the province with the same name from November 2016 to October 2017 Raqqa which had up to a million people back then eight hundred thousand to be precise including three hundred thousand people of the city population as well as those who found shelter I am talking about the temporary this displaced persons rocker was besieged by the us-led coalition the people were trapped in this city and they were used by ISIL simply has I used the comparison as a living shield as a human shield terrorists did not let them out and the coalition forces were not concerned about the creation of the humanitarian corridors in pterion ate through the UN or through any other international structures were not performed the city and knowledge in habitants were considered by the occupying forces as the capital of the ISIL Caliphate and the special notion which should be emphasized is that the relations between the ethnic Kurds and Arabs were escalated and raqqa was facing bombardments from the air and when the siege began American artillery began its howlings and most regions of the city were destroyed razed to the ground and the aerial frames published on the internet were likely made using a drone they show an atrocious picture but that which was destroyed can be rebuilt but some matters and some questions cannot be answered for example how many people are still in Raqqa what are their life conditions who is in power in the city who controls the situation in Raqqa and who as the so called Council of Raqqa reply to and respond to and what is it they access to the city from the regions under the control of the government of sea is non-existent even journalists are not allowed here simply not allowed to enter we often hear from our Western colleagues and journalists asking this question they ask us why we do not cover the situation in certain regions of Syria they all say that it is dangerous for their lives this is also an answer and in this case they are simply not allowed to come there perhaps this is due to the unwillingness of the liberators of Raqqa from Isis to show the price that was paid by the city's population for their liberation during the hostilities collateral damage is always present unfortunately this is a term coined term especially during them large-scale military operation to eliminate such a perverted enemy the international terrorism in the face of ISIL but we want the military tasks not to result in the destruction in the desolation of large regions we do not want it to doom the population to misery and humiliation by the winners on the other hand we should create the conditions for a quick restoration of economic and social infrastructure and to return the temporarily displaced persons and refugees to their homes no the not to tone the hardship filled lives of the people into real hell in our opinion who will be natural if this process was led by the official authorities in Syria remains a sovereign state and power and responsibility should cover the whole territory of the country and several more issues which also require an answer is anything being done for that in Raqqa what is the volume of the aid required for the people who remain in the city the answers should be given by the International evaluation mission and the prospects of his creation were welcomed by the government of Syria we must post for this week we have received a large number of questions from you and from your colleagues abroad these questions concern new systems of strategic weapons according to the foreign countries made with regard to the Vladimir Putin State of the Nation we have seen a large number of articles and official statements and statements made by political scientists and other experts they talk about the Russian new defense system but unfortunately this experts ignored the reasons for the development of such strategies they still ignore the fact that this is the step which should be regarded as a response to actions taken by the United States and NATO allies who continue to escalate the situation in military and in political situation Washington and its allies continue to impose their approaches in the circumvention of all the universally recognized mechanisms to maintain peace and security in the world the military domination runs like a golden thread in all the documents of the United States there are so many analytical documents written particularly than you u.s. nuclear doctrine there's a special attention to nuclear weapons they announced the creation of low-power warheads whose deployment will lower the threshold for the use of nuclear weapons he also announced about there will not to ratify the comprehensive nuclear-test-ban treaty and also about the intention to use all the means that they have to continue their full fledge to a nuclear test they use it from the position of force and this is a quote in line with the systems which President Putin announced we are shocked to hear any accusations of the fact that we violate all the international treaties and agreements the State Department mentioned the treaty on an intermediate-range missiles that tells that bans all the sides to deploy when based missiles with the range of five hundred and five thousand and five hundred kilometers but Lord Merton didn't didn't even mention that other countries also commented State of the Union address for example the Yamanashi officials said that Kremlin should make should do everything in order to to deny all everything they said and the ghrelin shouldn't be proud of for everything they are talking about we would like also to tell our German colleagues and say what particular international agreements and treaties on the control of armaments we are violating what so talking about exactly what Berlin what evidence Berlin has and why this evidence is not presented to the Russian Federation if Germany in their European allies as the official said view nuclear weapons at the direct threat to the security why are they not taking threats taking steps in order to not use all these weapons why there officials don't state that why articles and reviews not saying about this on the German TV why the German public is not bringing the toxin in this situation why are they not paying attention to the fact that there also are violations of all the agreements particularly when they give access to third countries to access to the third countries to use weapons this is the question that we have for the official representative of the Federal Republic of Germany and then we also have a question why Berlin is so concerned about the strategic stability since they are so concerned about the strategic stability why they're not commenting the not clear doctrine of the United States and stronger terms that they are doing as they're doing with the statement of the Russian president so maybe they the ignore the fact how these documents were compiled it still remains unclear why Berlin and other capitals were not concerned by the u.s. approach to the use of nuclear weapons that allows that is allowed to be used in emergency in emergency situation that are not limited to military scenarios such understanding of their role as guarantor of the global security could be fraught with nuclear strikes against those who the United States will you as aggressors the use of the use of low power nuclear warheads so will create dangerous situations so for all the states in the world even if there is a threat of even if there is a cybersecurity threat even if it's possible everything that was everything that seemed to us impossible it happened just to mention the girl in the asia-pacific or South Asia or in Africa will push the wrong button in and it's in her parents smartphone and well it's done already so we try to make our colleagues to discuss real problems that concern the Russian Federation and the international community as a whole particularly we offered our foreign partners to talk about the the limitations of the use of ABM systems but at the same time regardless of all their our calls they refused to talk with us but no one remembers that 99% of all articles don't mention it with that being a part of the US military potential potential this will be a threat to the world and in response to our arguments the United States talked about the Iranian nuclear threat and they said that they're not going to use the ABM system against the Russian Federation but all the rush initiatives to deploy the ABM systems were even ignored they have this agreements they stop this agreements with run but still they implement this agreements in the Eastern Europe I guess so the usest system to launch missiles that are prohibited by the inter intermediate-range missiles treaty for 3/4 the Russian Federation has decreased the number of missiles that prohibited by the act and treaty and so they will review all these statements and this is unprecedent in its scale at the same time around the russian non strategic nuclear weapons no strategic nuclear weapons we still see all the this big arranges speculations as if there is no reality there is no scenario scenario but there is a scenario that is written we see that the scenarios I used are used in the media but there are documents there are commitments taken by the United States and that are not respected by the United States I would like to strengthen once again that the development of new strategic weapons system is a response of the Russian Federation to the escalation of the military situation by the United States and their allies it's true that this response is symmetrical and no one expected that but I need to say once again that the Russian Federation hasn't been violated any treaty or convention we call on everyone to give a good examination to the Russian President State of the Nation Address and pay attention to the armaments that he mentioned because we create them in line with all the international conventions and treaties we're still open to the limitation and control of armaments in order to ensure the equitable and and non divisible security we're ready to still protect our national interests and to ensure a peaceful life for our citizens we believe that common sense will prevail and partners will find their strength to leave aside propagandists rhetoric and to start a fair and equal cooperation in the multipolar world let's together live in the real world don't let's let's not create a world virtual world and leave them let's talk about other relevant issues of the international agenda that we would like to comment the situation in the line of control between India in Pakistan the situation remains tense there we see that there were questions that are resulted in two casualties particularly among the civilian population we see we still we see that New Delhi and Islamabad have different positions on the reasons of the escalation of the situation we proceed from the fact from the fact that all the difference between India and Pakistan should be addressed through diplomatic channels and political channels based on the bilateral framework in line with similar agreement of 1972 in Lahore declaration 1999 Russian is interested to see the relation that relations between India and Pakistan should be developed in the principle in line with the principle of good nature neighborhood and that should continue their cooperation between them we would like also to provide commentary to the intra-syrian contacts that generates interests of journalists we have received many questions about that we welcome positive tendencies and there in the inter-korean dialogue that took place on the fifth sense sake of March when the special ambassador of the president of Republic of Korea visited Pyongyang he was he met with Kim Chang we believe that all the all the agreements reached between North and South Korea will be translated into practical steps and we call on all the stakeholders to facilitate this situation we're seeing that the result should be the stabilized situation and the establishment of the sustainable mechanism of peace and security in Asia and now let's talk about station and the Korean one of the aspects but particularly several days ago the Constitutional Court has made a decision that the adoption procedure of the Ukrainian law on the foundations of the state language policy of 2012 as non constitutional this qualification call all guaranteed national ethnic minorities of Ukraine to use their languages in various areas of the regions where ethnic minorities account for only 10 percent of the population of Ukraine it's evident that radical nationalists do not welcome this law that this law impedes them to impose in their country the so called Acron ization without taking into account various ethnic groups that live in ukraine who for people who speak different languages due to the fact that they were born in other countries this law is serves as an obstacle for radical nationalists to build the mono-ethnic State so we see that the Constitutional Court of Ukraine started helping them one of the decisions taking taken by the by them was devoting to abandon this law this was the first thing that they have done particularly mr. turchinov at that time didn't decide to support this decision and you know our Western colleagues have told us that that quite often particularly when the Russian delegation said that one of the reasons that provoked the situation in Ukraine this is an abnormal situation around the use of the Russian language and those who were in charge of the coup d'etat they decided they wanted to change the language policy in Ukraine that started to be developed they said that it was just to try and it wasn't successful that's it but now this the the actions were successful and what our colleagues from the OSCE and the EU will say what will the State Department say about that and what will other countries say about that particularly countries from the Western Europe or Canada bearing in mind their own experience of conducting language policy or maybe they won't find any words to comment the situation there particularly as they refused to comment their integration law what are the results in what are their future results you remember the results that we have seen in - and 2014 when the people living in Crimea decided to unify with Russia and the actions taken by radicals and political forces that supported radicals and their attempts to change the law this here has became a bit and mechanism for that and after that the civil war started in the eastern part of Ukraine I well I think that we will see in the future the consequences of the action taking by the Constitutional Court of Ukraine we see that Ukraine is not learning we still see that they continue to build mono-ethnic unitary state they don't want to recognize the fact that historically Ukraine a them multi-ethnic state with different ethnic groups lived there for centuries whose values whose interests and traditions should be respected the presence of various ethnic groups it's not a bad thing it's your legacy but I see that maybe they don't remember that or even are not to there of that fact and they receive what horrendous act they are taking this will only create new problems we would like to pay attention of our Western partners who help for their Ukrainian points that the support for this nationalist instinct will not result into positive consequences just look at the history the contemporary history and maybe the history of the 19th and 20th century I think that they contemporary story history will be enough we call on the UN OSCE and the Council of Europe to provide their evaluations of the discriminatory actions taken by Kiev who which violate all the international conventions and acts concerning human rights and language rights of ethnic minorities and ethnic groups another issue unfortunately it's a regrettable thing we receive another once again the information of the violation of the memorials and the in Vienna on in Vienna the memorial was did with black paint and due to that the Russian embassy in Austria sent the note to the European integration and Foreign Affairs Department in the Republic of Austria to eliminate this violation and to bring perpetrators to account and will shock by the fact that despite the our repeated calls to Austrian side to strengthen the security of the memorial to establish the security guards on the square or monitoring video monitoring our calls were not heard and the perpetrators were never held to account we hope that this case will be investigated by Austrian authorities and in the end they will solve this problem we'll take the necessary measures in accordance with their obligations the measures that would provide security for the memorials inadmissibility of the similar cases in the future especially in the situation when there are some upcoming events due to the liberation of the soldiers in the Second World War that will take place on this square will continue following the situation and I would like to add that we all understand pretty well that the installation of video cameras video monitoring on the square is not the issue of course of the budget its it is not that expensive for the availability of the video cameras especially in that places is necessary and we also have enough information and the video cameras will just easily solve this situation we do not know why they are not willing to do that there is no enough political will or availability of resources is add issue of fronts we do understand we all understand that it's not the issue of the financial resources maybe just political will the question that we received in our last briefing about the milk wars between Belarus and Russia I gave a short answer today I'm ready to provide you a more detailed one as I said last time I haven't identified any military activities between Russia and Belarus and the issue of Diaries and milk products the exchange of milk products continues between our countries because we're allies and according to the outcomes of the 2017 the import from Belarus of this type of products that is a significant part increased by 12 comma 2% and reached more than 4 billion u.s. dollars the dynamics is positive and of course in these volumes of experts sometimes there there are some problems and what is important is that these problems are being solved by the responsible agencies the Ministry of Agriculture they are in contact between each other and urgently solve all the problems and we are sure that they will be able to solve the problems that have been identified between them and this is the way we evaluate the situation we do not use this words that characterize the situation as a bad one but we can say that our Capetian is mutually beneficial in the area of trade another question that have been received recently before the briefing on the elections in Belgrade in particular we were asked how we evaluate the elections that took place on 4th of March in Serbia according to our evaluation the elections were carried out in accordance with all the democratic procedures multiple observers among which were six representatives of Russian embassy in Belgrade have not identified any violations the ruling Serbian Progressive Party won by majority and according to the preliminary information of the voting commission inscription and Belgrade the syrup the progressive party received 64 sets out of 110 and its partners social party received 10 and 9 nine dates we hope for to continue our multi-dimensional cooperation with new service authorities Serbian authorities also I would like to provide the answer considering that I see here the representatives of Italian media and I received a question from your colleagues just before the briefing asking to comment on the parliamentary elections in Italia and Italy I'm ready to do that last Sunday on 4th of March parameter and elections took place there and after that both chambers of Parliament started their operation with the participation of the President of the Republic of Italy material will be launched the process of establishment of new council of ministers in Italy we hope to continue our mutual beneficial cooperation with this country I would like to say that we received this answer but we received its question from the Italian journalist and finalizing my introductory part I would like to draw your attention to draw the attention of everyone who is going abroad the Russian citizens in the context of the upcoming elections presidential elections and additional to the information that have been given and considering the tendency to the every time more and more trips of our citizens abroad I would like to draw your attention to the medical insurance we do this procedure every year and it is not for nothing because this is a standard procedure to get the medical insurance it helps them in difficult situations and we always update the information necessary for our citizens abroad in case they need to refer to the to our embassies abroad and on our web page there is an updated information on these are free regime for Russian citizens and on this webpage you can also find all the necessary contact and information of the operation hours of our consulate departments on your smartphones you can install a special app that will help you when you are abroad and especially if you face a difficult situation there is an official web page for all embassies abroad of the Russian Federation the information is also published there and you can get all the answers to questions regarding political and consulate issues unfortunately when our citizens just do not pay enough attention to receiving medical insurance and they get into difficult situation extraordinary situations that requires the payment of some medical services some of them try to pay the to put the responsibility on our embassies abroad in accordance with the legislation the entrance and exit in and out of the our country in case of lack of medical insurance especially in some emergency situations versus the citizens that the person who needs the help our embassies are always available but medical insurance is still necessary to avoid any situations it could hurt you because the the medical insurance have not been received in a proper way just be vigilant and get the medical insurance and the last information we publish on a regular basis the interview of our ambassador in Argentina this is an interview of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs on cocaine issue the special operations that was carried out by Russia and Argentina to prevent illegal drug traffic and now we can state that since the operation is ongoing and there is a special campaign in social networks and the whole situation looks like the campaign to provide false information it's an attempt to give false information and I would like to draw your attention to defect to the material where we publish the right information and it is obvious that such speculations and such an information attacks of this level are not incidental who is the operator and who is trying to give false information and why they use social networks for 4 days to provide false information it's a question we also paid our attention that very often the materials the fake news are published on information resources financed by foreign governments directly and it's an issue of concern we analyzed such materials the trend of their development and appearance will is also being analyzed and will give them to this relevant agencies for analysis and further investigation we ask you to send us the questions and we will be ready to answer them and I would like to remind again that the investigation is ongoing in our I'm ready to answer your questions first of all I would like to add a little bit about the Italian elections it shows instability in Italy and not only in Italy because Italy is part of the European Union we appreciate that you give a positive assessment of what is going on in our country but you know we are always assess the elections that ongoing in different countries whether in Europe in European Union on other continents and we consider them an internal affair of the particular state its business of those people who live in this or that country and that is why this is the prerogative of those people who live in this country of the Parliament of the country to choose their leaders that we traditionally state that will respect the legitimate choice made by people and I can only confirm this Oh another question also about this issue about the meetings between lover of Antilles and Africa so American colleagues say it's quite a story the request to celebrate this meeting was sent through our ministries to Washington and the official representatives of this structure said that they haven't received any information any requests from us and they have no information at all this is not true we sent them a request and moreover we confirmed again this request during the discussions with our colleagues from the State Department and they confirmed and they said that they are working on this request we do not know why they said that they have not received anything from us because on Friday as the State Department informed they were closed due to wind and maybe some information were not received but there is no problems with wind anymore and they could start their operation and our embassy published a comment with full evaluation and assessment of what is going on the requests have been sent and we are now awaiting for the response from our American colleagues and I don't really want to give any further details on what is going on there I can assure you that the request has been sent and the confirmation has been received and they said that they are working on this issue they promised to give the answer but the answer was that no request received that is why I'm saying that unfortunately everything happens as usual yes please a meanie on TV last week Armenia know terminated the agreement signed in 1999 how Russia evaluatee actions by everyone within this treaty and where they adequate we didn't provide any assessment to all what was done because a representative was insu insu reef and we gave all the assessments there we proceed from the fact that it is important to normalize the relations between those countries which is in the interest of both countries and I would like to state again that insu reef at that time Russia was actively participated and effectively participated on on elaboration of the agreement reached and then we commented on this and our evaluation still remains the same BBC News London said that they will give a strong response in case just a second it is wrong it was defined it's not London who said it the minister said the foreign minister said Boris Johnson said when he was a Mayor of London we could say that London said but not anymore so if Russia has something to do with this story which is going on there with poisoning as you know yesterday we they were given some evaluations from the press secretary of the Russian Federation made three magnetic scoff I can his words and for today this information is adequate and this is the answer on the reasons what was the reason of what happened what happened was the person was used by foreign media for the purposes of anti Russian campaign the situation is being developed in a traditional way and there are traditional ideas that appear this campaign clearly shows the some made-up story and we can only call it a provocation to to make our relations even worse it was a country another question I would like to add one more thing proceeding from you evaluation of the situation you said that it's a story there were a lot of stories like like this what was the end of the story with very soft key what was the end of the story was revolutionary do you know of course not do we know nobody informed us neither through official channels between the minister ministries or through other channels nobody informed us and as you said this is a story you you're right and first they publish the story and develop the story in the media providing some accusations without facts and then another journalist nor publicity or authorities get the real information the scenario will repeat better policing and Berezovsky this they all had similar situation the scenario is still the same yes please did this creeper creeper renounced Russian citizenship I have no information on this issue but I know that he lives in London have you received any requests to support the investigation no official requests for today have been received yesterday there was made a statement and the comment as of today we have no haven't received any requests to joint or common work was Russia on investigation of this case yes please saveth McDouble the councillor for national security of Afghanistan has replied to Russia's concerns on the transport of Isis terrorists and using the helicopters and declared that at this point some of them are in Afghan and Afghan prison and he asked to send a group of Russian special services to investigate the case how can you comment on this you need to get more information I do not have it right now I will get to you later yes please he ordered to see my Japan Information Agency on the 1st of March President Putin during his speech declared that Russia has developed weapons and at this point the American Miss ballistic missile defense would be pointless and you said that this was a response but does that mean that we do not need to think about the global ballistic missile defense systems anymore including the systems in Northeast Asia and how about you is that your answer I think this is an answer you see we keep talking about this and we will repeat this we are talking about creating a global security system which would include the indivisible world world without safe or unsafe zones the world that does not concentrate strategic resources in order to make a certain country or a group of countries or regions safe and secure while making others unsecure we perceive from the understanding that we should establish international cooperation according to relevant agreements and doctrines and strategic papers and we have proposed such cooperation and such dialogue

only keep throwing in new and new fake information to fuel this candle and take note of the article that was published a day before the election a big enormous article with analytics what was the reason what was the point the point was to set up the Italian voters to inside fear and affect the elections that is an example of affecting and influencing the election we only declare that this was a free expression of the will of the people of Italy or any other country holding elections any more questions yes please Tim Ursula von Sputnik agency maria vladimirovna in December 2017 during the

question mr. solinsky's friends with Lavrov and he represents Russia on the world arena is there on this list can recording on the recording we hear the words of Slutsky so what does this have to do with the foreign ministry what is the link do you see any link Slutsky represents Russia on the world arena is the head of the committee for international affairs of the State Duma this does not concern the foreign ministry at all I will allow myself to say I will give myself the freedom to say that yesterday on air of the Russian radio station his topic was discussed and later we decided that we should talk about this problem before the 8th of March and tomorrow it will go live today we will record it and we will talk about it but I can only talk about this personally I do not see the reason for an official comment I think this is a matter to the relevant structure perhaps the Ethics Committee of the State Duma or to the parliamentarian himself I do not see the link with the foreign ministry and what can you say personally you will hear that on the radio yes please well Gary a medium reach maurice on some of the football fans of bulgaria asked to tell you that russia inspires them and we wanted to congratulate you on the upcoming holiday Maurice did you see what questions were asked some time later perhaps you'll also be accused of harassment we wanted to

candidacy to the honorable citizen and another organization yeah I see the procedure is very simple and another private organization said that they would discuss your candidacy and they give you the address registration in the city and you can choose from 1 to 60 options and the small present on this occasion from media most Bulgaria company by me oh now we're talking learn the lesson BBC thank you it's very beautiful I see this is a symbol of the Russian Bulgarian friendship these are the flags of Bulgaria and Russia the people of Bulgaria and Russia have always been together and recently I came back from Bulgaria but I see the colours of the Russian flag a bit confused everything is right there and all right let's agree that the presence of the colours is right and their positions can be argued and recently the Russian patriarch cyril returned from bulgaria and he was disappointed and i have to take matters in my own hands to show the closeness of our people so you're an unassigned minister so to speak and to show the closeness of our people i wanted to invite you to dance together we will discuss that any more questions or presence or gifts yes please hello on Syria the town of Goethe the reconciliation center in Syria has declared that it was ready to provide safe thanks ODIs or and escape for the armed groups and their families from east gouta was there any agreement reached on this occasion in order for these groups to leave is Goethe my only question is what is Russia's position Russia's position is that the terrorists who continue fighting and those who continue committing acts of terrorism should be eliminated those who want to surrender you know that it is possible to do and then this is also the civilians should have an opportunity to leave these regions which are currently in the hostilities zones any more questions yes please receive avoid any agency two questions the first on the first part of the briefing concerning Crimea senior Savchuk recently declared that she sent a letter to the Embassy of Ukraine saying that she has an intention of visiting Crimea through Ukraine and this situation has already been commented on the Parliament of Ukraine and they said that this situation was kids of phrenic and what would your common be and the second question the US has implementing new sections against North Korea for the use of chemical weapons and murder of Kim jong-un's brother and what do you think about the implementation of these sanctions and keeping in mind the dynamics between North Korea and South Korea you know our position on the sanction policy and sanction actions and we proceed from the fact that the sanctions which were introduced by the Security Council in particular concerning North Korea are absolutely legitimate as for other sanctions even though they are motivated by the situation in the Korean Peninsula and in North Korea in particular they are adopted in addition to the Security Council decisions but not through it and they are motivated my issues other than those discussed in the Security Council they have not been approved by the Security Council and we do not think they are legitimate and we think that the current situation and we have seen the picture developing in front of our eyes in a very dramatic fashion a couple of months ago in this hole we had questions on the prospects of full-scale hostilities on the peninsula that is why we should welcome everything that is being done in order to calm down the situation and in order to restore peace and talks we should be very careful in this situation and not get involved in the provocative actions which could aggravate the situation and throw it back and come back to what we started from this in enormous tension as for your first question you know I have seen the reports I think it was yesterday in the evening or rather this morning and this reminded me of the situation of the mid-2000s rather past 2005 I was working in New York back then in the rush and permanent mission at the UN and there was a Security Council session involving heads of state and from the Americans they had US President George Bush and it was a rather funny story he was sitting in the Security Council hall had a table and during the session he kept writing something down on the list of paper and later we found out that photographer of one of the agencies was trying to take a picture of him and then the photo was published online and in his notes the u.s. president george w bush was asking for permission from his counselor Condoleezza Rice if he could go to the toilet so everyone asks permission if they think it is required any more questions yes please hello Jeffrey's information agency my name is Anastasia recently after the President's speech much is being said about the new military power of Russia but we all know that we have most beautiful soft power it is you that's why I want to congratulate you on the 8th of March
