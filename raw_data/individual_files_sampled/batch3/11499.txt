hello and welcome to crosstalk where all things are considered I'm Peter LaBelle on this edition of crosstalk we discuss whether de contas possible even desirable why isn't it a good idea to get along with Russia and much much more crosstalking they taunt I'm joined by my guests here in Moscow Aric Krause he's an independent political risk analyst also we have Dmitry Babbage he's a political analyst Putin in international and in Cyprus we have Alex Christopher oh he's the director and writer for the duran dot-com all right gentlemen crosstalk rules in effect that means he can jump in any time you want and I always appreciate it let me go to Alex first in in Cyprus we have a new phrase that's popped up in the latest news cycle and that's criminalizing diplomacy and an esteemed expert probably the greatest living expert on Russia in the Western world Stephen Cohen was on CNN with well someone with a very dubious Road record when it comes to foreign policy mr. max boot before I go to you Alex let's have a watch at this clip I've been studying Russia for 45 years I've lived in Russia and I've lived here and you've literally was a taxi for Russia hasn't it right it excuse me what did you say to me I said you've been consistently an apologist for Russia in those last 45 years all right I don't do defamation to people I do serious analysis of serious national security problems when people like you call people like me and not only me but people more eminently apologists for Russia because we don't agree with your analysis you are criminalizing diplomacy okay Alex criminalizing diplomacy I think it really hits the nail on the head here because any kind of rational thought about what kind of foreign policy or bilateral relationship Russia in the United States should have is called into question by people like max boot that gets a lot of airtime for reasons that are is a mystery to me go ahead Alex yeah I find it strange that max boot is is calling Stephen Cohen a Putin apologist I'd like to call max boot a war machine apologist he's an apologist for the military-industrial complex he's an apologist for war criminals has this guy got in anything right ever in his career he pushed Iraq WMD he was wrong he pushed Libya he was wrong he pushed Syria he was wrong he push Ukraine he was wrong it's absolutely amazing that they give this guy any airtime whatsoever and we can remember I think was three or four months back Peter remember that Tucker Carlson had max boot on show and Tucker Carlson crushed olives he crushed him and he showed what an idiot max food max food is an apologist for stupid people around the world Dima but he's very popular okay because he says the right things to the right people well on that video Stephen Cohen also has to explain to Meg's boot that this so-called Russian Madeleine it's not Pearl Harbor well I think you know I was very impressed when several US senators and other prominent politicians when they compared 2016 election and they alleged Russian medal into Pearl Harbor one of the people just wrote hey you idiots you know my father survived Pearl Harbor he saw what it was please you know stop doing that you know these kind of comparisons are insulting to America in the first not only is that era Queen we have a new call for sanctions coming out of the US Senate now I they're on they're on vacation right now they're on leave so I don't think they're going to act upon it but it is it's really just virtuous signaling okay and I think we're going to continue to see this until the minute its one-upsmanship basically there is a large part of the American political establishment which is desperate to find something to beat Trump with and that is the Russia card and nobody loses points for beating up on Russia now that's the fact that this goes against American fundamental diplomatic and geopolitical interests which are really to avoid creating a coalition where between Russia and China isn't their problem their problem right now is to score quick political gain yes Alex let me go back to you in Cyprus quick political gain and of course they're they're getting it but the implications in the long term are fundamental because I think now that it's a generational thing I mean why in the world would Russia want to have better relations with the United States it doesn't have much trade okay the issues that that are the bringing them together Russia holds most of the cards here and you have a political establish a more with itself so I mean date on tea is possible but the Americans and the foreign policy Blom assumed that Russia wants that I don't think that's the case go ahead Alex and how can you have they taught when just the other day you had this bizarre White House press briefing that where all the guys were there you had Christopher Ryu had coats you had Bolton and once again they're pushing out the narrative of Russia election involvement keep in mind they're not saying meddling anymore they're not saying interference now its involvement and of course no one's defining what the hell this is they're just sitting there and they're getting together this Trump's deep State these these are the guys around the Trump administration or the deep state and they're pushing this narrative and they're scapegoating Russia because if the Democrats lose it's gonna be Russia exactly it's gonna be Russia's fault so Russia's is the ultimate scapegoat teammates it's the paranoia of not knowing what you don't know there's going to be some meddling but how and where the assumption that it's going to be let me remind you that the election has not yet it's going to be in November but then quotes is already saying the head of the National Intelligence he's already saying that there is evidence about Russians involvement and we'd have Lindsey Graham who has just advised President Trump to check the so COBOL that Putin gave to him a thousand t to check it for KGB bugs we have this very same person evaporating with other senators this new draft law which is called if I am not mistaken in the translation protect an American security from the Kremlin's aggression 2018 so these guys they can foresee the future they can see how Russia is mad and in turn you know this reminds me it's kind of a bad episode of The Twilight Zone okay the we've got to unfortunately have to take it seriously you are talking about well what is Russia want from the United States Russia wants to be left alone Russia has its own problems Russia is still undergoing a major restructuring and the Americans have managed to weaponize finance they can cause a lot of damage by blocking people from the international financial system they blocked them from the dollar system first but then the European banks are all running scared of the US Treasury so they can do substantial damage and yes the political dialogue in Washington is because there was already a sub that means there's the assumption that somehow under some circumstances Russia is going to buckle that is a wrong assumption buckle Russia is most certainly not going to buckle and Russia has survived very well everything they've thrown at it for the simple reason that Russia has had a very conservative fiscal and monetary policy the central bank has done an excellent job of insulating Russia from the shocks but it's still very inconvenient sir these draft law has not yet been published but Lindsey Graham has already and that's why I think when they proposed that they went on recess they have no intention right now of doing it it's just it's as part of the course yes the background go ahead but the things that we know about it are already very very sinister not only for Russians anyone who is suspected of influencing their American elections can be barred from entering the country maybe even a really good Alex I would deem a hit me I got to the punch line before me does that mean the FBI and the CIA and all the rest of them can again the end world when the Israelis always have an influence in American politics but the interesting thing is to say they are not addressing the real meddling in the 2016 election and that is in the DOJ in the FBI Alex as the corporate media don't forget yeah the DOJ the FBI let's not forget the real election battling was also against Bernie Sanders right and it was Hillary Clinton and the DNC ripped off Bernie Sanders from winning winning the Democratic nomination and the bill that they're proposing right now is very sinister indeed they're even asking Mike Pompeo Secretary of State to examine placing Russia on the state list of terrorist sponsors that's how hysterical this thing is becoming known as grandstanding here you know putting Russia on a list for probes state sponsors of terror that is that that's a little bit more than grandstanding okay and Erika you know me go to D me here it's hard to walk these things back my question to Eric earlier is this isn't working under the assumption that Russia is going to surrender that is a wrong assumption well it works on a lot of assumptions for example it's a suggest to penalize Russia for the production and use of chemical weapons you know who used chemical weapons okay there is the Duma thing you know where people who were shown on the video by the white helmets to be victims of a chemical attack later on these people healthy and the wife address the press conference in The Hague and told how this fake video was made that you just said happened but it's not only RT and a few other outlets reported the the backstory to this this a false flag operation all the others concentrated on who paid the air ticket for these people to come from Damascus to the hate well okay these people are on the video that you show to the whole world you said they were victims of a chemical attack why don't you want to listen to them Alex you go back to Cyprus Iran one more minute before we go to the break here so it looks like Russia Russia Russia is is going to be continued all the way to the midterms or in lieu of the Mueller report go ahead Alex yeah I think even when the Mueller report is is finalized and I think we are coming to an end it's very apparent that the whole Russia thing is just gonna last until probably a total Trump either wins re-election and that's going to go on for another four years or until they get rid of Trump because the Russia thing is not down you can see it in the White House press briefing they're gonna scapegoat Russia for everything but the most important point to all of this is that the American people don't care we've seen poll after poll Alex shows that Russia ranks very low just ripped just real quick do you think Paul Manafort will go to federal prison because Hank has good taste in clothes he definitely has thick good taste in clothes and I think when everything wraps up he will get aparted from Trump I think that's in the cards here gentlemen I'm gonna jump in here we're gonna go to a short break and after that short break we'll continue our discussion on some real news stay with our team welcome back to crosstalk where all things are considered on Peter LaBelle to remind you were discussing some real news okay let me go to Eric now we were talking about this new Senate bill that's going to sanction the Russian economy and individuals but this is a pattern and you alluded to it earlier this is warfare by different means it's sanctioned warfare and we see the u.s. applying it in particularly what's maybe what's nuanced here in the Trump administration that it's accused against quote unquote allies we could talk a little bit about Turkey on that too the problem basically is that the global financial system since basically 1945 has been very heavily dollarized and this was it wasn't it wasn't really a cup topic for discussion for a long time now more recently the Americans have decided that it's easier to throw sanctions than to shoot weapons and those issues missiles so basically what they can do and they've done in the case of Russia is cut off individuals from the control of their own assets some of these oligarchs were very close to the Kremlin others were very distant from the Kremlin major Russian companies have suddenly been become unable to do business on the global market they can do this and they can sort of like using snipers they can take out people on the streets of Moscow from a distance and it's relatively hard to fight against because you could say well yes people will use the euro but the European buckles of the secondary sanctions so it's really quite hard to fight against and if you take countries like Turkey they're doing the same thing they're not happy with Turkish policy so they're sanctioning individuals but this is all very unilateral here note not only people on the streets of Moscow but also their relatives yes because the law says the draft law says that you know not only the Russian businessman who have any relations with the Russian government will be checked but also their relatives this Israeli since then coming back to the Turkish thing it's the first president when one native country is applying sanctions against another NATO member country and it is doing that the United States is doing that in the framework of the so-called Magnitsky list now these two Turkish Minister Suleiman solo of the Interior and Abdul Hameed good of the Justice they are basically sanctioned they are attacked in the framework of the Magnitsky list why because of their of that parson from the United States who basically has been living in Turkey for twenty twenty-three years who hasn't been doing anything in the United States well if you tell me about it it's about freedom of religion I'm sorry I don't know Alex let me go do P I absolutely agree with deem it has nothing to do about freedom of conscience and religion here it's really about changing the behavior of air to one's regime this is a lot about Iran it's a lot about Syria and and Russia and then and the interesting thing is is that the European Union they will they will buckle and they will take a knee the Turks are not going to take a knee and we're gonna find this out fast and hard in November because they're not going to respect the sanctions imposed upon them by the United States visa vie Iran go ahead Alex yeah I think I think that the United States and the EU are going to be very surprised to see a very strong arrow on a very determined air the one to not buckle and what we saw in Turkey last week and we discussed this Peter what we saw in Turkey was a turkey that is exploring its options we saw them going to the BRICS meeting we saw China and Russia and all the BRICS members very happy to have Turkey on board and we're seeing turkey now even examining even examining and considering its NATO membership and this is huge is the geopolitical earthquake to see Turkey it's like brexit shifting it's like frenzy it's a brazen here deema that they it is is air21 flirting right now is he in the bazaar right now because I don't see them leaving NATO anytime soon but it's planting the seed we have options we have friends has already been excluded from the United States weapons program I mean it's serious you know that the rhetoric between Turkey and the EU was awful in the last few months so basically all this adventure in the Middle East that mr. Obama started in when he basically supported their insurgents against the Syrian government it backfired terribly because what did the United States want to do you know from their point of view of interests of the United States they wanted to take out one small regime which was basically not anti-american but which had a pro Soviet history the Syrian regime what was the net result they lost a much more important airway turkey in the process and they failed to oust the Syrian regime but I just want to return very quickly to this very important detail about the Magnitsky let us remind our listeners and our viewers what it came from you know in 2012 the United States supported a rogue businessman bill Browder you know his lawyer died in the Russian prison and Browder turned it against Russia there's an even though there is an excellent documentary on the internet on YouTube but catch you have to look for it because Browder and his people are having it taken down laughter just a few words you know Browdy came to Russia in the 1990s with 46 million of not his money he left Russia in 2005 with 2 billion you know he paid taxes on that well Paul Manafort is now been investigated for non paying taxes on the amounts which are one thousandth of the amount that Bill Brown debate but bill Browder shared his US citizenship on time so now we have Paul Manafort facing a possible sentence of 305 completely shed a lot more than that you know that's it stick with the Turkish theme here because I think you know I probably brought up with Alex here this is like a looming brigs it I mean everyone is a very difficult person to work with what he's handed but he's certainly sending very strong signals that he's not happy with the status quo turkeys never gonna be part of the European Union he's beginning to see his off he almost got into a shooting war with Russia we shouldn't forget about 18 months ago they patched this one over very nicely mr. Putin forgave and forgot the problem is if you look at Russian policy Russian economic policy Russia has been able to defy the Empire because they have been had it had a very careful and a very conservative debt in domestic policy turkey has not the lira is falling like a rock turkish businesses are very heavily indebted they have to refinance a huge amount but there are options aren't there not well I mean I'd be a good reason to join brigs women you would have access to international - not provide the kind of finance that turkey needs right now it's fine us trying to provide state-to-state finance they do not provide much private finance remember the RMB is still not convertible the Hong Kong banks are scared to death of the Americans they will not provide any support to any sanction to entity Chinese banks they can't because they don't have a convertible currency yet and but they have a whole lot of dollars Dima go ahead I don't think they want the Chinese currency the problem is that China has just imposed input tariffs on 200 billion dollars worth of Chinese inputs to the United States China responded by much smaller strike and tell me now who is hampering free trade here let me call Xi Jinping you know at the Davos forum just one year ago he said this we must promote trade and investment liberalisation and facilitation through opening up and say no to protectionism end of quote this is exactly the rhetoric that the United States has been using against our the countries for 50 years at least right using it whether is it we are waiting for the development of an alternative global financial system and because we want it we see it right around the corner the problem is this is a decade long process this takes a lot of time and I mean global commodities are priced in dollars most global capital flows from dollars so China can begin to replace this but they're gonna do it in their own way we've been we've already gotten a lot of examples here how the sanction warfare works but you know when the primary the hegemon with the almighty dollar you start antagonizing too many people at the same time then you know politics is always about odd bedfellows okay you're gonna have these odd bedfellows beginning to work together and this is going to be at the exclusion of the United States Alex go ahead yeah and especially when you antagonize leaders like err Diwan and when we can't forget that after the coup the failed coup aired Awad made sure that he purged the military of all its power and he solidified his power and and much like Trump in the US air Dolan has has a base in the middle of Turkey inside Turkey that's very very loyal to him yeah and no matter how bad the situation can get in Turkey aired Owen can always turn to his base and he can make sure that he's going to stay in power and that's the problem that the u.s. is antagonizing leaders that are very powerful that have a very strong base that will support them through thick and through thin yeah well I think it's very important that the Magnitsky Act was used against turkey because what what is it about the McGee's get it is against Western values people are included in that blacklist without them even knowing tents yeah without the trial it you know it's just enough that the New York Times or The Washington Post writes something bad about this person right and until now these were Russians targeted by this list now these are Turks tomorrow maybe Chinese so you have you have a coalition against this kind of policy from the United States which is basically defending Western values politically we can all agree is that the United States is going to eventually create a coalition of countries which is simply too uncomfortable with the system which has been shown to be very very dangerous recited to them and at some point they are going to begin to coalesce around China which is the elephant the elevator now this is something that Trump understood and Trump was very much desirous of pulling China a pulling Russia away from China we discussed this so many times here I think that raised I think the first test here generally we're almost out of timing the first test is going to be in November what countries are going to obey Washington when it comes to Iran's oil experts we are exports we already know that Turkey is not going to on earth that's going to be it's not going me is not going to do it China certainly is not so this is going to be very interesting litmus test at the same time we have a hot and cold rhetoric coming out of the White House when it comes to Iran so that will be a developing story all right gentlemen I'm gonna jump in here that's all the time we have for this part of our program any thanks to our guest in Moscow and in Cyprus this is the end of our broadcast segment stay with us for the extended version on our YouTube channel see you next time and remember crosstalk rules now for the extended version of our program when we have political potpourri all right Alex let me go to you first in Cyprus what's on your mind I tend to think it's a something to do with media and Jim Acosta and a few other folks go ahead yeah we have a media meltdown and what I like to consider a media unveiling a media revelation and the first one is that Jim Acosta when he was at the Trump rally and the the crowds were very hostile against him and of course Jim Acosta being the legal maniac yeah yeah yeah capitalized on it and then he played the victim card very well of course the entire mainstream media the liberal mainstream media you know found his backhand and they supported him of course it don't support Julian Assange good points a much reported story but they support Jim Acosta getting heckled by some audience members who actually after that that video there's numerous reports that say those very people were laughing with Jim Acosta asking him for his autograph talking to him so it was all pretty much in how its it was a show and Jim Acosta plays that show well we also the New York Times coming out and really revealing the liberal the radical liberal left outfit that it is and that comes through Sarah John the the person they hired to be unbelievable and her tweets that she sent out just three years ago were there's no other way to categorize them but as racist the the difference is that they were racist against white men white women and police officers and instead of the New York Times apologizing or issuing some sort of retraction they doubled down and say this support Sarah John because she is of Asian descent and thus she so that that's so that's why Roseanne Barr got fired and not this woman okay because she was bigoted against the the wrong people here so Peter no one knows what are the rules of the game what are they who are we allowed to criticize who are we not allowed to criticize who's a racist who's not a reality I know that I know the rule just nod your head and agree that's a demon Europe you know Facebook was basically forced by the government to disrupt a counter demonstration against white supremacists why because this counter demonstration was supposedly let me quote what what the US law protection people were saying it could possibly be inspired by the Russians as a part of a grandma campaign so dispensing in the United States so that is just hilarious course at this point has simply become whatever discord whatever disagreement there is the United States and the United States is in a low-intensity Civil War right now they have somehow managed to blame it all on the sternness if Putin wanted to get the gun lobby's going if you wanted to create the sort of street fighter you're getting in the city couldn't he does America when you're adversaries are in a circular firing squad what's the best strategy duck duck or stay away okay because that's exactly what's happening right it's become a bit of a caricature at this point the the everybody hates Russia the Democrats do because they're desperate for a fig leaf to explain why they lost the election and for something to beat Trump with the Republicans because I always did because the the right-wing the traditional Republican Party was always extremely anti-russian so it has become a very useful battle ax for just about everybody the factory they're cutting off their on the leg but that's like that's like supporting 31 flavors of jihad in Syria you never know how to turn it off okay and you never know what the outcome Alex let me go to you because I think was really interesting I wish I could remember the program I think was Meet the Press where they had some guests saying that well Facebook should be shut down until after the election and I'm just thinking that's it they want to shut down social media because the tricked the legacy media wants their monopoly back how many times have I said that on this program just shut it down okay that's what they want that's what they want because they want their monopoly back because you have people like Facebook and Twitter they did they have it they they do not understand what they have created and once you start censoring it you destroy your business model it's lose-lose go ahead and Alex go ahead and Peter and Peter going back to that Facebook case that that Dima was mentioning and the fact that they shut down this this demonstration against white supremacists you even had Chelsea Manning I mean you don't get more liberal left in Chelsea Manning come out and say that that the protest that was organized on Facebook the page that got shut down was indeed authentic so they have Chelsea Manning going up against my facebook and she's being banned by Facebook that's why I say just stand aside and let them all let the dragon eat its tail cuz that's exactly what's happening go ahead a created their own monster by allowing alternative we would not have drunk we would not have bricks it we would not have a lot of the alternative political parties in Europe without social media without social media because this has allowed a voice to those who do not I mean exactly growing up Peter you and I we would read the video and we would know that they were being lied to but was no way to talk back to them yes we could among our friends now we can sort of broadcast the world and you get competing narratives and the reason the establishment is so hysterical in the u.s. is right now is because they don't want people to hear competing narratives I'm not saying that arty is God's truth I'm simply saying oh it's one version whines one interpretation you have conclude there's a wide variety the only way you can get at the truth is to hear really widely well I mean if a facebook story okay Russia is supporting anti white supremacists demonstration it's bad but then we have this story with Maria boo Tina she supports the Second Amendment the Second Amendment she's bad and suddenly all the mainstream media not only in the United States but also in the UK they shared all their all their shenanigans about protecting the women suddenly the BBC has basically a story about Maria butanna which James judges rightly called kind of slut-shaming you know yeah they go after her they they say that she has a boyfriend who is 56 which is almost twice her age oh how awful that's a crime you know right she offers sex for a job they guys never happened they give no evidence but like it's a huge crime you know but then you know the most interesting thing is that the Guardian also in the UK they found a Russian female spy in the US Embassy in Moscow and here's what she did she had access to the most damaging database which is the schedules of the presidents and their spouses in Moscow including Hillary Clinton and of course well you know I was on the pool of of President Yeltsin and I remember that this was the Daoist part of it all the so-called diamond program you know that the the first lady's you know meeting with all of these you know activists this was usually the Daoist and they call it the most sensitive Alex Whittaker you mean you need to explain something to me okay I need some kind of sure / to explain liberalism okay and I'm not you're not I know I'm not saying that you are that so we have stormy Daniels it's given the key to the city in Hollywood and then we have this young Russian woman boo Tina she's a ashamed because of she had a relationship there was it was consensual okay so I mean where's the balance here what is a pornstar and one is someone that has not committed any crime go ahead and she's in jail no she's right geez a jail yeah the ones in jail and the other ones on CNN and MSNBC and she's loaded as a great humanitarian and a sales coach are called photographs like how could you achieve such greatness greatness exactly Peter I think liberalism the neoliberalism and the liberalism we're seeing today is all about power and as long as they have power it's just like you said earlier in our previous segment everyone else should just shut up and not and they'll lay out the rules of the game whatever they may be as long as they have the power was really those are pearls of wisdom and we're gonna end the program here we're going on vacation crosstalk we'll be back in September I hope you've enjoyed the program and remember crosstalk rules
