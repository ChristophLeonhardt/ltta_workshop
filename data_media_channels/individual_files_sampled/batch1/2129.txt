monogamy it's been around since the days of ancient Mesopotamia and for as long as monogamy has existed so is adultery and cheating society is always frowned on it from the Ten Commandments to the modern-day legal system where adultery is still considered a felony in five states but cheating still occurs what makes people cheat we'll start with men I talked to em Gary Numan he's a psychotherapist and author who conducted a survey of men who admitted they'd been unfaithful forty-eight percent said that the main reason they cheated was because of emotional dissatisfaction Newman says that men are much more sensitive than many people might think if they don't think they're getting enough praise or admiration from their current partner they'll seek it out from someone new it turns out that men find a lot of this praise and admiration in the workplace Newman said that 40% of the men he surveyed met the other woman at work where female colleagues are more likely to look up to them and compliment them on their accomplishments of course physical attraction plays a role when men stray but it's not as big as you might think Newman said that 88% of the cheating men said that the woman they cheated with was less physically attractive than their current partner another contributing factor for men who cheat in able errs 77 percent of the men who cheated said they also had a close friend who had been unfaithful Newman says that when men see someone else doing it it's easier for them to justify their behavior even if they know it's wrong and most of them do indeed know it's wrong according to Newman 68 percent of cheating men said they felt guilty about it so it's not all about sex after all it's about feelings men are sensitive and need to feel like they're wanted I know pretty sad right
