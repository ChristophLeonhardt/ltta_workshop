cNN has done an investigation into Morgan Freeman and unfortunately over a dozen women have come forward and alleged that he had sexually harassed them now these allegations don't go so far as to accuse him of anything like rape but the sexual harassment claims are pretty serious so let's get to that 16 people did speak to CNN about Morgan Freeman as part of this investigation eight of whom said they were victims of what some called harassment and others called inappropriate behavior eight said they witnessed Freeman's alleged conduct what I found interesting about these statements these women gave to CNN was that the majority of these sexual harassment instances happened in public they didn't happen behind closed doors well we talked about this a little bit off air I think that some folks from the old world right from older generations thought that some of this behavior was normal that didn't make it normal that didn't make it right but they grew up in that culture work guys especially if they were rich or powerful got through whatever they wanted and that's the culture we're trying to change but I think that's why they do it in public remember George HW Bush would whenever taking pictures would grab the ass of the woman he's taking the picture with and he joke around about it he publicly in front of his wife in front of everybody say you know my favorite comedian is David Copperfield and he would always use that joke and think yeah this is hilarious they love it yeah and so and you know I don't know what was it Morgan Freeman's head but it is interesting that he did it in public and I want to be clear that he hasn't denied these allegations he did release a statement I'll get to that in just a minute now I want to give you some specific examples of what the women are alleging so first there was a production assistant who said that Freeman subjected her to unwanted touching and comments about her figure and clothing on a near daily basis Freeman would rest his hand on her lower back and rub her lower back so it got worse though this this was in my pi√±on one of the more severe allegations against him oh the one that's coming out the one that's coming up which is by the same woman okay she says that Freeman kept trying to lift my skirt and asking if I was wearing underwear he never successfully lifted her skirt she said he would touch it and try to lift it she would move away and then he try again eventually she said alan arkin made a comment telling him to stop Morgan got freaked out and didn't know what to say good for alan arkin yeah I love that he called him out in that case another woman a woman who was a senior member of the production staff of the movie now you see me in 2012 told CNN that Freeman sexually harassed her and her female assistant on numerous occasions by making comments about their bodies the allegations against Freeman are not about things that happened in private they were in public in front of witnesses even in front of cameras and so he would make comments about whether or not their clothing was too form-fitting oh don't wear that it's too form-fitting which would not make me happy I would be very annoyed by that comment but he would sometimes according to some of these women just walk toward them stand in front of them and just to hurt their breasts in front of other people my guess as to why a lot of these stars do this is because in probably a huge percentage of cases it works so works not meaning that they lift lets you lift a skirt but they he probably thought it was flirting I'm not trying to make excuses for him you can't lift up a woman's skirts that's crazy right and probably in some of the cases it was flirting and and probably led to other things happening right that's why this movement is important because he apparently a lot of folks in this country have to be told no that's not kosher it's not cool to go and stare it with his breasts even if you're a star you know what does that remind you right now others like Trump have been accused of far far worse he says I just grabbed them I don't ask permission right and he's the president by the way and and he been accused of like throwing a woman up against the wall and grabbing her genitals just like he said in the famous Access Hollywood tapes in this case it's it's different it's what Ana just read you right we don't get too much into comparing what's worse etc etc it's of course disappointing and I don't know there's people who don't like Morgan Freeman and we don't really know him of course maybe we just know through movies and he seems so likable on the movies I remember when the Bill Cosby for the thing first happened it was heartbreaking we grew up with Bill Cosby by now I now have a different image of Bill Cosby but on day one its Dustin Hoffman Morgan Freeman etc don't do that why did you do that and it's and most importantly why'd you do that to those women you had to realize that I guess they didn't or maybe they didn't didn't care that that's gonna put them in a terrible spot you've got enormous power there on that movie set and it could affect their careers you absolutely positively can't do that to another human being and I just want to add one other thing look I don't like comparing the severity of allegations but I will say this for some it might seem like a man just simply staring at a woman's breasts in the workplace is not that big of a deal but it's incredibly degrading and demeaning especially when it's done in public where other colleagues see it happening it makes you feel like you're only there for one reason and one reason only and that you're just a piece of meat and it really does feel degrading so just keep that in mind it's not something small it's something that makes women feel pretty terrible so Morgan Freeman did respond to the allegations against him the sexual harassment allegations and he said the following anyone who knows me or has worked with me knows I am NOT someone who would intentionally offend or knowingly make anyone feel uneasy I apologize to anyone who felt uncomfortable or disrespected that was never my intent so he didn't deny anything but he did apologize so I think it's important to share that with you all two easy ways for the young turks want us hit the subscribe button down below then you're a
