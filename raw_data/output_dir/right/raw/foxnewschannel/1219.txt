1
00:00:11,065 --> 00:00:12,967
JUDGE JEANINE: WHAT DO PEOPLE

2
00:00:12,967 --> 00:00:17,638
THINK OF SAMANTHA BEE'S HATEFUL

3
00:00:17,638 --> 00:00:18,005
COMMENTS?

4
00:00:18,005 --> 00:00:22,243
TAKE A LOOK AT "STREET JUSTICE."

5
00:00:22,243 --> 00:00:25,713
SAMANTHA BEE CALLS PRESIDENT

6
00:00:25,713 --> 00:00:28,149
TRUMP'S DAUGHTER IVANKA A

7
00:00:28,149 --> 00:00:29,851
FECKLESS C WORD.

8
00:00:29,851 --> 00:00:31,185
WHICH MOST OF PEOPLE HAVE NEVER

9
00:00:31,185 --> 00:00:32,086
EVEN SAID.

10
00:00:32,086 --> 00:00:34,088
BUT SHE STILL HAS HER SHOW.

11
00:00:34,088 --> 00:00:36,424
SHOULD SHE BE ABLE TO KEEP HER

12
00:00:36,424 --> 00:00:36,724
SHOW?

13
00:00:36,724 --> 00:00:39,227
>> I DON'T THINK SHE'LL GET MUCH

14
00:00:39,227 --> 00:00:40,995
SUPPORT FOR USING LANGUAGE LIKE

15
00:00:40,995 --> 00:00:41,596
THAT.

16
00:00:41,596 --> 00:00:43,464
I KNOW I WOULDN'T WATCH IT.

17
00:00:43,464 --> 00:00:45,233
JUDGE JEANINE: IF THAT WERE SAID

18
00:00:45,233 --> 00:00:48,336
AGAINST A DEMOCRAT'S DAUGHTER.

19
00:00:48,336 --> 00:00:50,838
>> THE WORLD WOULD BE UPROAR.

20
00:00:50,838 --> 00:00:52,440
JUDGE JEANINE: AND SHE WOULD

21
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:53,341
LOSE HER SHOW?

22
00:00:53,341 --> 00:00:55,109
>> ABSOLUTELY.

23
00:00:55,109 --> 00:00:56,878
JUDGE JEANINE: ROSEANNE BARR

24
00:00:56,878 --> 00:00:58,646
LOST HER SHOW, WHAT SHOULD

25
00:00:58,646 --> 00:01:01,449
HAPPEN TO SAMANTHA BEE?

26
00:01:01,449 --> 00:01:06,153
>> I THINK SHE BETTER BE

27
00:01:06,153 --> 00:01:07,855
PREPARED FOR PEOPLE TO NOT PAY

28
00:01:07,855 --> 00:01:08,222
ATTENTION.

29
00:01:08,222 --> 00:01:10,391
>> SHE HAS THE RIGHT TO SAY

30
00:01:10,391 --> 00:01:13,628
SOMETHING, BUT SHE SHOULD BE

31
00:01:13,628 --> 00:01:15,663
HELD ACCOUNTABLE THE SAME WAY

32
00:01:15,663 --> 00:01:17,198
ROSEANNE HAS THE RIGHT TO SAY

33
00:01:17,198 --> 00:01:19,267
SOMETHING BUT SHOULD BE HELD

34
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:21,736
>> IT WAS PERSONAL.

35
00:01:21,736 --> 00:01:25,172
IT WASN'T RACIAL.

36
00:01:25,172 --> 00:01:26,741
JENNA: IT WAS WOMAN HATING.

37
00:01:26,741 --> 00:01:30,011
>> BUT A WOMAN SAID IT.

38
00:01:30,011 --> 00:01:31,579
JUDGE JEANINE: IS THERE A

39
00:01:31,579 --> 00:01:32,947
DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE WAY THEY

40
00:01:32,947 --> 00:01:36,617
TREAT LIBERALS AND THE WAY THEY

41
00:01:36,617 --> 00:01:37,818
TREAT REPUBLICANS.

42
00:01:37,818 --> 00:01:40,521
>> THERE IS A DOUBLE STANDARD

43
00:01:40,521 --> 00:01:41,889
ACROSS THE BOARD.

44
00:01:41,889 --> 00:01:47,528
A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE HYPOCRITIC.

45
00:01:47,528 --> 00:01:50,665
JUDGE JEANINE: SAMANTHA BEE SAYS

46
00:01:50,665 --> 00:01:52,033
SOMETHING TERRIBLE ABOUT

47
00:01:52,033 --> 00:01:54,669
PRESIDENT TRUMP'S DAUGHTER, SHE

48
00:01:54,669 --> 00:01:57,004
CALLS HER A FECKLESS C WORD.

49
00:01:57,004 --> 00:01:59,740
>> SHE SHOULD BE FIRED.

50
00:01:59,740 --> 00:02:01,943
JUDGE JEANINE: SHE IS NOT BEING

51
00:02:01,943 --> 00:02:02,243
FIRED.

52
00:02:02,243 --> 00:02:03,844
>> WHY NOT?

53
00:02:03,844 --> 00:02:04,312
FAIR IS FAIR.

54
00:02:04,312 --> 00:02:06,881
>> IT'S NOT APPROPRIATE TO SAY

55
00:02:06,881 --> 00:02:09,116
THESE THINGS ON TELEVISION IN

56
00:02:09,116 --> 00:02:09,584
PUBLIC.

57
00:02:09,584 --> 00:02:11,352
YOU SHOULD KEEP IT FOR YOURSELF

58
00:02:11,352 --> 00:02:15,156
AND NOT SUCH A BIG AUDIENCE.

59
00:02:15,156 --> 00:00:00,000
JUDGE JEANINE: WHAT SHOULD
