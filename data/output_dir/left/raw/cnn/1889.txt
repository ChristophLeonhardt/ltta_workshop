general Dunford Deputy Secretary Shannon
in Colonel Duggan most especially thank

3
00:00:18,150 --> 00:00:23,789
you to the men and women of Fort Myer
and every member of the United States

4
00:00:23,789 --> 00:00:31,199
military at home and abroad we send our
thoughts and prayers to the families of

5
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:36,260
our brave sailors who were injured and
lost after a tragic collision at sea as

6
00:00:36,260 --> 00:00:43,950
well as to those conducting the search
and recovery efforts I am here tonight

7
00:00:43,950 --> 00:00:50,969
to lay out our path forward in
Afghanistan and South Asia but before I

8
00:00:50,969 --> 00:00:55,829
provide the details of our new strategy
I want to say a few words to the service

9
00:00:55,829 --> 00:01:02,550
members here with us tonight to those
watching from their posts and to all

10
00:01:02,550 --> 00:01:10,320
Americans listening at home since the
founding of our Republic our country has

11
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:17,640
produced a special class of heroes whose
selflessness courage and resolve is

12
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:24,930
unmatched in human history American
patriots from every generation have

13
00:01:24,930 --> 00:01:31,070
given their last breath on the
battlefield for our nation and for our

14
00:01:31,070 --> 00:01:40,259
freedom through their lives and though
their lives were cut short in their

15
00:01:40,259 --> 00:01:48,990
deeds they achieved total immortality by
following the heroic example of those

16
00:01:48,990 --> 00:01:54,810
who fought to preserve our Republic we
can find the inspiration our country

17
00:01:54,810 --> 00:02:04,920
needs to unify to heal and to remain one
nation under God the men and women of

18
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:12,160
our military operators one team
with one shared mission and one shared

19
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:20,330
sense of purpose they transcend every
line of race ethnicity creed and color

20
00:02:20,330 --> 00:02:29,630
to serve together and sacrifice together
in absolutely perfect cohesion that is

21
00:02:29,630 --> 00:02:34,840
because all service members are brothers
and sisters

22
00:02:35,260 --> 00:02:44,210
they're all part of the same family it's
called the American family they take the

23
00:02:44,210 --> 00:02:53,060
same oath fight for the same flag and
live according to the same law they are

24
00:02:53,060 --> 00:02:59,510
bound together by common purpose mutual
trust and selfless devotion to our

25
00:02:59,510 --> 00:03:06,140
nation and to each other the soldier
understands what we as a nation too

26
00:03:06,140 --> 00:03:13,540
often forget that a wound inflicted upon
a single member of our community is a

27
00:03:13,540 --> 00:03:24,280
wound inflicted upon us all when one
part of America hurts we all heard and

28
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:33,020
when one citizen suffers and injustice
we all suffer together loyalty to our

29
00:03:33,020 --> 00:03:40,370
nation demands loyalty to one another
love for America requires love for all

30
00:03:40,370 --> 00:03:47,660
of its people when we open our hearts to
patriotism there is no room for

31
00:03:47,660 --> 00:03:56,240
prejudice no place for bigotry and no
tolerance for hate the young men and

32
00:03:56,240 --> 00:04:03,020
women we send to fight our wars abroad
deserve to return to a country that is

33
00:04:03,020 --> 00:04:10,000
not at war with itself at home we cannot
remain a force for peace in the world

34
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:17,209
but we are not at peace with each other
as we send our bravest to defeat our

35
00:04:17,209 --> 00:04:22,910
enemies overseas and we will always win
let us find the cur

36
00:04:22,910 --> 00:04:29,990
to heal our divisions within let us make
a simple promise to the men and women we

37
00:04:29,990 --> 00:04:35,660
asked to fight in our name that when
they returned home from battle they will

38
00:04:35,660 --> 00:04:42,140
find a country that has renewed the
sacred bonds of love and loyalty that

39
00:04:42,140 --> 00:04:49,010
unite us together as one thanks to the
vigilance and skill of the American

40
00:04:49,010 --> 00:04:53,770
military and of our many allies
throughout the world

41
00:04:53,770 --> 00:05:02,390
horrors on the scale of September 11th
and nobody can ever forget that have not

42
00:05:02,390 --> 00:05:09,860
been repeated on our shores but we must
acknowledge the reality I am here to

43
00:05:09,860 --> 00:05:16,100
talk about tonight that nearly 16 years
after September 11th attacks after the

44
00:05:16,100 --> 00:05:23,090
extraordinary sacrifice of blood and
treasure the American people are weary

45
00:05:23,090 --> 00:05:30,710
of war without victory nowhere is this
more evident than with the war in

46
00:05:30,710 --> 00:05:40,070
Afghanistan the longest war in American
history 17 years I share the American

47
00:05:40,070 --> 00:05:47,330
people's frustration I also share their
frustration over a foreign policy that

48
00:05:47,330 --> 00:05:54,530
has spent too much time energy money and
most importantly lives trying to rebuild

49
00:05:54,530 --> 00:06:00,860
countries in our own image instead of
pursuing our security interests above

50
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:09,680
all other considerations that is why
shortly after my inauguration I directed

51
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:15,650
secretary of defense mattis and my
national security team to undertake a

52
00:06:15,650 --> 00:06:23,320
comprehensive review of all strategic
options in Afghanistan and South Asia

53
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:32,240
my original instinct was to pull out and
historically I like following my

54
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:36,780
instincts but all my life I've heard
that decision

55
00:06:36,780 --> 00:06:43,680
are much different when you sit behind
the desk in the Oval Office in other

56
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:49,980
words when you're President of the
United States so I studied Afghanistan

57
00:06:49,980 --> 00:06:56,340
in great detail and from every
conceivable angle after many meetings

58
00:06:56,340 --> 00:07:03,720
over many months we held our final
meeting last Friday at Camp David with

59
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:08,820
my cabinet and generals to complete our
strategy

60
00:07:08,820 --> 00:07:13,800
I arrived at three fundamental
conclusion about America's core

61
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:21,360
interests in Afghanistan first a nation
must seek an honorable and enduring

62
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:26,630
outcome worthy of the tremendous
sacrifices that have been made

63
00:07:26,630 --> 00:07:34,320
especially the sacrifices of lives the
men and women who serve our nation in

64
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:41,040
combat deserve a plan for victory they
deserve the tools they need and the

65
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:49,169
trust they have earned to fight and to
win second the consequences of a rapid

66
00:07:49,169 --> 00:07:56,550
exit are both predictable and
unacceptable 9/11 the worst terrorist

67
00:07:56,550 --> 00:08:03,810
attack in our history was planned and
directed from Afghanistan because that

68
00:08:03,810 --> 00:08:11,120
country was ruled by a government that
gave comfort and shelter to terrorists a

69
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:18,060
hasty withdrawal would create a vacuum
the terrorists including Isis and

70
00:08:18,060 --> 00:08:26,729
al-qaeda would instantly fill just as
happened before September 11th and as we

71
00:08:26,729 --> 00:08:38,219
know in 2011 America hastily and
mistakenly withdrew from Iraq as a

72
00:08:38,219 --> 00:08:45,680
result our hard-won gains slipped back
into the hands of terrorists enemies our

73
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:50,790
soldiers watched as cities they had
fought for and bled to liberal

74
00:08:50,790 --> 00:08:58,230
and one were occupied by a terrorist
group called Isis the vacuum we created

75
00:08:58,230 --> 00:09:05,040
by leaving too soon gave safe haven for
Isis to spread to grow recruit and

76
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:12,270
launch attacks we cannot repeat in
Afghanistan the mistake our leaders made

77
00:09:12,270 --> 00:09:20,100
in Iraq third and finally I concluded
that the security threats we face in

78
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:28,500
Afghanistan and the broader region are
immense today twenty US designated

79
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:34,260
foreign terrorist organizations are
active in Afghanistan and Pakistan the

80
00:09:34,260 --> 00:09:42,410
highest concentration in any region
anywhere in the world for its part

81
00:09:42,410 --> 00:09:52,260
Pakistan often gives safe haven to
agents of chaos violence and terror the

82
00:09:52,260 --> 00:09:57,210
threat is worse because Pakistan and
Indian are two nuclear-armed States

83
00:09:57,210 --> 00:10:03,690
whose tense relations threatened to
spiral into conflict and that could

84
00:10:03,690 --> 00:10:09,450
happen no one denies that we have
inherited a challenging and troubling

85
00:10:09,450 --> 00:10:16,050
situation in Afghanistan and South Asia
but we do not have the luxury of going

86
00:10:16,050 --> 00:10:21,450
back in time and making different or
better decisions when I became president

87
00:10:21,450 --> 00:10:28,080
I was given a bad and very complex hand
but I fully knew what I was getting into

88
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:34,740
big and intricate problems but one way
or another these problems will be solved

89
00:10:34,740 --> 00:10:43,500
I'm a problem solver and in the end we
will win we must address the reality of

90
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:50,210
the world as it exists right now the
threats we face and the confronting of

91
00:10:50,210 --> 00:10:58,260
all of the problems of today and
extremely predictable consequences of a

92
00:10:58,260 --> 00:11:04,620
hasty withdrawal we need look no further
than last week's vial

93
00:11:04,620 --> 00:11:11,310
vicious attack in Barcelona to
understand that terror groups will stop

94
00:11:11,310 --> 00:11:19,710
at nothing to commit the mass murder of
innocent men women and children you saw

95
00:11:19,710 --> 00:11:26,610
it for yourself horrible as I outlined
in my speech in Saudi Arabia three

96
00:11:26,610 --> 00:11:31,860
months ago America and our partners are
committed to stripping terrorists of

97
00:11:31,860 --> 00:11:37,200
their territory cutting off their
funding and exposing the false allure of

98
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:44,310
their evil ideology terrorists who
slaughter innocent people will find no

99
00:11:44,310 --> 00:11:50,910
glory in this life or the next
they are nothing but thugs and criminals

100
00:11:50,910 --> 00:11:58,920
and predators and that's right losers
working alongside our allies we will

101
00:11:58,920 --> 00:12:03,900
break their will dry up their
recruitment keep them from crossing our

102
00:12:03,900 --> 00:12:10,500
borders and yes we will defeat them and
we will defeat them handily in

103
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:16,950
Afghanistan and Pakistan America's
interests are clear we must stop the

104
00:12:16,950 --> 00:12:22,170
resurgence of safe havens that enable
terrorists who threaten America and we

105
00:12:22,170 --> 00:12:26,760
must prevent nuclear weapons and
materials from coming into the hands of

106
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:33,530
terrorists and being used against us or
anywhere in the world for that matter

107
00:12:33,530 --> 00:12:40,410
but to prosecute this war we will learn
from history as a result of a

108
00:12:40,410 --> 00:12:45,750
comprehensive review American strategy
in Afghanistan and South Asia will

109
00:12:45,750 --> 00:12:52,920
change dramatically in the following
ways a core pillar of our new strategy

110
00:12:52,920 --> 00:13:00,450
is a shift from a time-based approach to
one based on conditions I've said it

111
00:13:00,450 --> 00:13:05,160
many times how counterproductive it is
for the United States to announce in

112
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:12,720
advance the dates we intend to begin or
end military options we will not talk

113
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:18,480
about numbers of troops where our plans
for further military

114
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:25,399
these conditions on the ground not
arbitrary timetables will guide our

115
00:13:25,399 --> 00:13:32,190
strategy from now on America's enemies
must never know our plans or believe

116
00:13:32,190 --> 00:13:39,329
they can wait us out I will not say when
we are going to attack but attack we

117
00:13:39,329 --> 00:13:46,920
will another fundamental pillar of our
new strategy is the integration of all

118
00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:53,399
instruments of American power diplomatic
economic and military toward a

119
00:13:53,399 --> 00:14:00,480
successful outcome someday after an
effective military effort perhaps it

120
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:04,500
will be possible to have a political
settlement that includes elements of the

121
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:13,170
Taliban and Afghanistan but nobody knows
if or when that will ever happen America

122
00:14:13,170 --> 00:14:19,110
will continue its support for the Afghan
government and the Afghan military as

123
00:14:19,110 --> 00:14:25,560
they confront the Taliban in the field
ultimately it is up to the people of

124
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:31,380
Afghanistan to take ownership of their
future to govern their society and to

125
00:14:31,380 --> 00:14:37,680
achieve an ever lasting peace we are a
partner and a friend but we will not

126
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:43,160
dictate to the Afghan people how to live
or how to govern their own complex

127
00:14:43,160 --> 00:14:51,660
society we are not nation-building again
we are killing terrorists the next

128
00:14:51,660 --> 00:14:59,480
pillar of our new strategy is to change
the approach and how to deal with

129
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:05,339
Pakistan we can no longer be silent
about Pakistan safe havens for terrorist

130
00:15:05,339 --> 00:15:11,490
organizations the Taliban and other
groups that pose a threat to the region

131
00:15:11,490 --> 00:15:17,579
and beyond Pakistan has much to gain
from partnering with our effort in

132
00:15:17,579 --> 00:15:24,170
Afghanistan it has much to lose by
continuing to harbor criminals and

133
00:15:24,170 --> 00:15:31,290
terrorists in the past Pakistan has been
a valued partner our militaries have

134
00:15:31,290 --> 00:15:35,339
worked together
against common enemies the Pakistani

135
00:15:35,339 --> 00:15:40,889
people have suffered greatly from
terrorism and extremism we recognize

136
00:15:40,889 --> 00:15:47,850
those contributions and those sacrifices
but Pakistan has also sheltered the same

137
00:15:47,850 --> 00:15:55,559
organizations that try every single day
to kill our people we have been paying

138
00:15:55,559 --> 00:16:01,889
Pakistan billions and billions of
dollars at the same time they are

139
00:16:01,889 --> 00:16:07,889
housing the very terrorists that we are
fighting but that will have to change

140
00:16:07,889 --> 00:16:13,800
and that will change immediately
no partnership can survive a country's

141
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:18,089
harboring of militants and terrorists
who target US service members and

142
00:16:18,089 --> 00:16:23,610
officials this time for Pakistan to
demonstrate its commitment to

143
00:16:23,610 --> 00:16:29,850
civilization order and to peace
another critical part of the South Asia

144
00:16:29,850 --> 00:16:35,550
strategy for America is to further
develop its strategic partnership with

145
00:16:35,550 --> 00:16:41,819
India the world's largest democracy and
a key security and economic partner of

146
00:16:41,819 --> 00:16:45,779
the United States
we appreciate India's important

147
00:16:45,779 --> 00:16:51,209
contributions to stability in
Afghanistan but India makes billions of

148
00:16:51,209 --> 00:16:57,120
dollars in trade with the United States
and we want them to help us more with

149
00:16:57,120 --> 00:17:04,289
Afghanistan especially in the area of
economic assistance and development we

150
00:17:04,289 --> 00:17:08,549
are committed to pursuing our shared
objectives for peace and security in

151
00:17:08,549 --> 00:17:15,449
South Asia and the broader Indo Pacific
region finally my administration won't

152
00:17:15,449 --> 00:17:21,898
sure that you the brave defenders of the
American people will have the necessary

153
00:17:21,898 --> 00:17:27,058
tools and rules of engagement to make
this strategy work and work effectively

154
00:17:27,059 --> 00:17:31,679
and work quickly
I have already lifted restrictions the

155
00:17:31,679 --> 00:17:35,429
previous administration placed on our
warfighters

156
00:17:35,429 --> 00:17:40,679
that prevented the Secretary of Defense
and our commanders in the field from

157
00:17:40,679 --> 00:17:45,740
fully and swiftly waging battle against
the enemy

158
00:17:45,740 --> 00:17:52,320
micromanagement from Washington DC does
not win battles there one in the field

159
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:59,299
drawing upon the judgment and expertise
of wartime commanders and frontline

160
00:17:59,299 --> 00:18:06,059
soldiers acting in real time with real
authority and with a clear mission to

161
00:18:06,059 --> 00:18:13,380
defeat the enemy that's why we will also
expand Authority for American armed

162
00:18:13,380 --> 00:18:17,130
forces to target the terrorists and
criminal networks

163
00:18:17,130 --> 00:18:23,159
that's so violence and chaos throughout
Afghanistan these killers need to know

164
00:18:23,159 --> 00:18:29,490
they have nowhere to hide that no place
is beyond the reach of American might

165
00:18:29,490 --> 00:18:36,630
and American arms retribution will be
fast and powerful as we lift

166
00:18:36,630 --> 00:18:41,669
restrictions and expand authorities in
the field we are already seeing dramatic

167
00:18:41,669 --> 00:18:47,820
results in the campaign to defeat Isis
including the liberation of Mosul in

168
00:18:47,820 --> 00:18:54,179
Iraq since my inauguration we have
achieved record-breaking success in that

169
00:18:54,179 --> 00:18:59,580
regard we will also maximize sanctions
and other financial and law enforcement

170
00:18:59,580 --> 00:19:06,559
actions against these networks to
eliminate their ability to export terror

171
00:19:06,559 --> 00:19:12,299
when America commits it's warriors to
battle we must ensure they have every

172
00:19:12,299 --> 00:19:19,799
weapon to apply swift decisive and
overwhelming force our troops will fight

173
00:19:19,799 --> 00:19:28,460
to win we will fight to win from now on
victory will have a clear definition

174
00:19:28,460 --> 00:19:35,400
attacking our enemies obliterating Isis
crushing al Qaeda preventing the Taliban

175
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:40,289
from taking over Afghanistan and
stopping mass terror attacks against

176
00:19:40,289 --> 00:19:46,440
America before they emerge we will ask
our NATO allies and global partners to

177
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:51,929
support our new strategy with additional
troop and funding increases in line with

178
00:19:51,929 --> 00:19:58,140
our own we are confident they will since
taking office I have made clear that our

179
00:19:58,140 --> 00:20:02,909
allies and partners
must contribute much more money to our

180
00:20:02,909 --> 00:20:11,909
collective defense and they have done so
in this struggle the heaviest burden

181
00:20:11,909 --> 00:20:16,469
will continue to be borne by the good
people of Afghanistan and their

182
00:20:16,469 --> 00:20:23,219
courageous armed forces as the Prime
Minister of Afghanistan has promised we

183
00:20:23,219 --> 00:20:29,940
are going to participate in economic
development to help defray the cost of

184
00:20:29,940 --> 00:20:35,700
this war to us Afghanistan is fighting
to defend and secure their country

185
00:20:35,700 --> 00:20:41,219
against the same enemies who threaten us
the stronger the Afghan security forces

186
00:20:41,219 --> 00:20:48,089
become the less we will have to do
Afghans will secure and build their own

187
00:20:48,089 --> 00:20:55,499
nation and define their own future we
want them to succeed but we will no

188
00:20:55,499 --> 00:21:00,929
longer use American military might to
construct democracies in faraway lands

189
00:21:00,929 --> 00:21:06,950
we'll try to rebuild other countries in
our own image those days are now over

190
00:21:06,950 --> 00:21:11,940
instead we will work with allies and
partners to protect our shared interests

191
00:21:11,940 --> 00:21:17,190
we are not asking others to change their
way of life but to pursue common goals

192
00:21:17,190 --> 00:21:23,909
that allow our children to live better
and safer lives this principled realism

193
00:21:23,909 --> 00:21:29,519
will guide our decisions moving forward
military power alone will not bring

194
00:21:29,519 --> 00:21:34,499
peace to Afghanistan or stop the
terrorist threat arising in that country

195
00:21:34,499 --> 00:21:39,269
but strategically applied force aims to
create the conditions for a political

196
00:21:39,269 --> 00:21:46,919
process to achieve a lasting peace
America will work with the Afghan

197
00:21:46,919 --> 00:21:53,960
government as long as we see
determination and progress however our

198
00:21:53,960 --> 00:22:01,529
commitment is not unlimited and our
support is not a blank check the

199
00:22:01,529 --> 00:22:07,889
government of Afghanistan must carry
their share of the military political

200
00:22:07,889 --> 00:22:12,960
and economic burden
the American people expect to see real

201
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:21,540
reforms real progress and real results
our patience is not unlimited we will

202
00:22:21,540 --> 00:22:28,080
keep our eyes wide open in abiding by
the oath I took on January 20th I will

203
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:34,350
remain steadfast in protecting American
lives and American interests in this

204
00:22:34,350 --> 00:22:40,799
effort we will make common cause with
any nation that chooses to stand and

205
00:22:40,799 --> 00:22:47,730
fight alongside us against this global
threat terrorists take heed America will

206
00:22:47,730 --> 00:22:54,049
never let up until you are dealt a
lasting defeat under my administration

207
00:22:54,049 --> 00:23:00,540
many billions of dollars more is being
spent on our military and this includes

208
00:23:00,540 --> 00:23:06,750
vast amounts being spent on our nuclear
arsenal and missile defense in every

209
00:23:06,750 --> 00:23:13,980
generation we have faced down evil and
we have always prevailed we prevailed

210
00:23:13,980 --> 00:23:20,970
because we know who we are and what we
are fighting for not far from where we

211
00:23:20,970 --> 00:23:25,049
are gathered tonight hundreds of
thousands of America's greatest Patriots

212
00:23:25,049 --> 00:23:33,919
lay in eternal rest at Arlington
National Cemetery there is more courage

213
00:23:33,919 --> 00:23:42,090
sacrifice and love in those hallowed
grounds than in any other spot on the

214
00:23:42,090 --> 00:23:48,450
face of the earth many of those who have
fought and died in Afghanistan enlisted

215
00:23:48,450 --> 00:23:55,020
in the months after September 11th 2001
they volunteered for a simple reason

216
00:23:55,020 --> 00:24:01,590
they loved America and they were
determined to protect her now we must

217
00:24:01,590 --> 00:24:07,470
secure the cause for which they gave
their lives we must unite to defend

218
00:24:07,470 --> 00:24:14,280
America from its enemies abroad we must
restore the bonds of loyalty among our

219
00:24:14,280 --> 00:24:22,140
citizens at home and we must achieve an
honorable and enduring outcome worthy of

220
00:24:22,140 --> 00:24:27,400
the enormous price
that so many have paid our actions and

221
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:32,530
in months to come
all of them will honor the sacrifice of

222
00:24:32,530 --> 00:24:39,160
every fallen hero every family who lost
a loved one and every wounded warrior

223
00:24:39,160 --> 00:24:46,630
who shed their blood in defense of our
great nation with our resolve we will

224
00:24:46,630 --> 00:24:53,140
ensure that your service and that your
families will bring about the defeat of

225
00:24:53,140 --> 00:25:00,130
our enemies and the arrival of peace we
will push onward to victory with power

226
00:25:00,130 --> 00:25:07,150
