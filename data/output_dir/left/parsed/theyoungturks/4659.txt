MARTIN SHKRELI, THE INFAMOUS
PHARMA BRO, IS ABOUT TO STAND
TRIAL, AND OF COURSE THE FIRST
PART OF THE TRIAL IS JURY
SELECTION.
HOWEVER, THEY ARE HAVING A
REALLY HARD TIME FINDING
THE RIGHT JURORS, BECAUSE
PEOPLE AREN'T CURRENTLY BIASED
AGAINST HIM.
IN FACT, PEOPLE DON'T EVEN KNOW
ANYTHING ABOUT HIM, SEE HIS
FACE AND THINK THAT HE LOOKS
LIKE A CROOK, AND THAT THEY
CANNOT GET PAST THAT IN ORDER TO
RULE IN AN UNBIASED FASHION.
TO GIVE YOU THE DETAILS; MORE
THAN 120 POTENTIAL JURORS WERE
DISMISSED MONDAY FROM THE
FEDERAL COURT TRIAL IN BROOKLYN,
WHERE HE FACES EIGHT COUNTS OF
SECURITIES AND WIRE FRAUD
RELATED TO HIS TWO HEDGE FUNDS,
AND HIS DRUG COMPANY.
THIS ISN'T EVEN RELATED TO HIS
DRUG COMPANY THAT HE HAD, KNOWN
AS TOURING PHARMACEUTICALS,
WHERE HE SAID THAT FAMOUS DRUG
PRICE HIKE, FROM THREE DOLLARS
FOR DESCENT RATE FELL TO $750 A
PILL, SO HE IS A BAD DUDE.
WHEN THE POTENTIAL JURORS WERE
QUESTIONED ABOUT HIM, HERE ARE
SOME OF THE QUOTES, OR
STATEMENTS THAT THEY MADE:
ONE JUROR SAID, "THIS IS THE
PRICE GOUGE OR OF DRUGS.
MY KIDS ARE ON SOME OF THESE
DRUGS.
THIS IMPACTS MY KIDS."
GONE.
GONE.
I LIKE THE JURY SYSTEM, I KNOW
THAT IT'S NOT OFTEN TIMES
POPULAR OPINION, BUT I LIKE
FACING A JURY OF MY PEERS,
BUT IT'S KIND OF A WEIRD
SITUATION WHERE, IF YOU ARE
PERSONALLY AFFECTED BY THIS, AND
HENCE UNDERSTAND IT BETTER
THAN ANYONE ELSE, YOU ARE NOT
ALLOWED ON THE JURY.
THEY CONSIDER IT BIAS.
I WOULD CONSIDER IT A VERY
LEGITIMATE PERSPECTIVE, BUT
THOSE GUYS ARE GONE.
LET ME GIVE YOU A FEW OTHER
EXAMPLES OF PEOPLE WHO WILL
NOT BE ON THE JURY.
MANY JURORS SEEM TO SEE SHKRELI
AS THE FACE OF CORPORATE GREED
IN AMERICA, THAT IS WHAT ONE
INDIVIDUAL SAID.
ANOTHER SAID, "I THINK HE'S A
VERY EVIL MAN.
I DON'T THINK I CAN BE FAIR.
MY OPINION IS PRE-WELL-INFORMED,
I WOULDN'T WANT TO SERVE ON THIS
JURY."
HE'S SAYING THAT HIS OPINION IS
FORMED.
I'M SORRY, FORMED.
I WOULD RELEASE HIM, ONE DUDE
THINKS HE IS EVIL BEFORE
THE TRIAL EVEN STARTS.
NOT EVERYONE WHO WAS A POTENTIAL
JUROR NEW WHO HE WAS, THEY
DON'T NECESSARILY FOLLOW THE
NEWS, BUT THEY SEEM ñ
BUT THEY SEEM TO HAVE A BIAS
AGAINST HIM BASED ON FACE ALONE,
AND THAT WAS A PRETTY CREDIBLE
COMPONENTS TO THIS STORY.
SO, ONE PERSON DIDN'T KNOW
ANYTHING ABOUT THIS STORY
SAID, "I LOOKED RIGHT AT HIM,
AND IN MY SAID THAT'S IN MY
HEAD I SAID, THAT'S A SNAKE ñ
NOT KNOWING WHO HE WAS."
SOME MIGHT SAY, ISN'T THAT A
LITTLE UNFAIR?
BUT HE CAN'T EVEN TAKE A SINGLE
PICTURE WITHOUT LOOKING LIKE A
SMUG PRICK.
IF YOU DON'T BELIEVE ME, LET'S
GO TO GRAPHIC 9.
LET'S GO TO GRAPHIC 10.
HE JUST ALWAYS HAS THIS ñ
YEAH, HE DOESN'T HAVE TO MAKE
THAT FACE.
LOOK AT THAT FACE, WHY DOES HE
MAKE THAT BASE?
IT'S LIKE HE WANTS PEOPLE TO
HATE HIM.
IT'S NOT THE CONTOURS OF HIS
FACE, IT'S THE LOOK THAT HE
CONSTANTLY HAS, LIKE HA HA, I'M
SCREWING YOU SOMEHOW.
IT'S THE EXPRESSION.
YEAH, AND THEN MY FAVORITE QUOTE
ñ
AGAIN, THIS WAS A PERSON WHO DID
NOT KNOW WHAT ABOUT HIM PRIOR TO
JURY SELECTION ñ ONE MAN SAID,
"HE KIND OF LOOKS LIKE A DICK."
HE WAS LET ONTO THE JURY
BECAUSE THE JUDGE FOUND THAT
STATEMENT TO BE ACCURATE.
NO, HE WASN'T.
SHKRELI MIGHT HAVE A TOUGH
TIME IN THIS CASE, PARTLY
BECAUSE HE IS WRONG.
I TOLD YOU, I BELIEVE IN THE
JURY SYSTEM, THEY CAN SENSE
THAT THIS GUY IS WHO HE ACTUALLY
IS.
YEAH, LOOK, WE OBVIOUSLY COVERED
HIM, AND WE KNOW THAT HE IS
NOT A GREAT PERSON; HOWEVER, I
THINK EVERYONE, REGARDLESS
OF WHO THEY ARE, DESERVES A
FAIR TRIAL, AND SO I DO HOPE
THAT THEY FIND JURORS WHO ARE
NOT IMMEDIATELY BIASED
AGAINST HIM, AND I HOPE JUSTICE
IS SERVED.
THAT'S MY TAKE ON IT.
IF YOU SAY SO.
NO, OF COURSE!
OF COURSE.
I KNOW SHKRELI MIGHT BE A UNIQUE
CASE, BUT OVERALL DON'T MAKE
JUDGMENTS ABOUT PEOPLE BASED ON
THEIR FACE.
BELIEVE ME, YOU WILL HAVE 20 OF
EVIDENCE 
TO DECIDE THAT HE IS A
DICK ANYWAY.
