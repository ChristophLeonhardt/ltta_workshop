just goes to show how you can leverage your fame beyond just the music about a decade ago The Economist interviewed the director of the company that makes Cristal champagnes one of the most expensive champagnes in the world favored by Russian Czars over history he was asked what did he think about all these rappers drinking Cristal champagne and he basically said well we can't forbid people from buying it not exactly a ringing endorsement of a new customer base he thought that rappers didn't read The Economist but he was wrong jay-z heard about his comments removed it from his 40/40 club but more importantly he started issuing this sort of directive to his fans not to drink it either and instead of rapping about Cristal and you put his money where his mouth was he ended up investing in and eventually taking over French Champagne brand called Armand de Brignac aka ace of spades you see this in his videos the gold bottles he raps about it all the time and this has now become one of his most valuable assets in his entire portfolio Diddy does not have his own champagne however he has something just as perhaps even more valuable which is his deal with Diageo's Ciroc vodka he started out with them in the late 2000s and at that point Ciroc was just a middling vodka brand being chilled by no-name former NFL players they decided to take a chance on Diddy and they didn't really have anything to lose because Ciroc wasn't doing very well it was about the 50th ranked vodka in the world and so did he came on and he applied his typical marketing panache and his shock and awe salesmanship this was around the time that Barack Obama was running for president he started calling himself Ciroc Obama given that free product placement within only a few years Ciroc was number two in the premium vodka category to only Greg goose doing about two million cases of a year there's a really fascinating connection between Diddy and jay-z in the spirits world between the two of them I mean you think you know same job description hip hop mogul two very different guys two very different approaches but born a month apart in the same city both named Shaun and they both use the same cheap grape as the base of two of the most important products that's the trivia no grape which is considered by wine officials to be you know sort of a nothing grape it's a filler it's table wine jay-z has a con yak called do se which is a joint venture with Bacardi of course if you're making con yak it doesn't really matter because they're grapes that you have to include in order to be officially called cognac as far as Diddy's Ciroc vodka goes using grapes is rather unorthodox vodkas typically made out of potatoes or grains or something like that so that was kind of his first philosophy with Ciroc is to Center on the sexiness of the grape one and a half ounces of Sirach Moffitt only make it was to rock bachlin other boxes don't work one thing that gets kind of lost in all of the promotion of Sirach and such is that Reb you know is actually a very cheap grape and not some super fancy thing at the end of the day jay-z and Diddy are both excellent savvy businessmen of course they're not going to get the most expensive great because in order to do well in a product you have to have a low cost you have to have a high price they've grasped that better than anybody and the success that they've had with Soraka do say certainly go to prove that as well
