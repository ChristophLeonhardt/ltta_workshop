we'll get your silly pink cat your obscenity ridden protest sign and gas up your friend's Prius because the feminists and women's rights activists are about to be marching in droves because a woman was actually arrested and put in jail for hugging in public wait you mean not a single protester March oh no sorry that actually happened in Saudi Arabia and that theocratic government is run by a religion of peace so they're not allowed to march against that I'm been days this is pure Hollywood as you know in Saudi Arabia women are not allowed to mix with men in public who are not related to them obviously and this poor woman actually hugged this man who I will not even try to pronounce his name but apparently he's a celebrity over there in Saudi Arabia and by the way this guy is totally fine for him this is completely ok and she was sent to jail now this may come as a surprise to some people living here but not to anyone who lives in Saudi Arabia Saudi Arabia is a theocratic monarchy and has one of the most tightly controlled governments in the world which is also why Saudi Arabia has a dress code for all women in the country including being one of seven countries in the area that still have the death penalty let me repeat the death penalty for being gay don't get that started about sexuality for women no one is above that including a Saudi princess who is 19 years old named Masha Hal who was publicly executed and shot in the back of the head in 1977 for doing what for committing adultery a prince says I wonder what happens to everybody else another thing these women should be marching for is probably the fact that Saudi Arabia is allowed to be on the Human Rights Council for the UN end quote as a member of the Human Rights Council Saudi Arabia is required to upload the highest standard of Human Rights unquote why are activists not marching in droves for these human rights violations well because Islam is a religion of peace and the mainstream media is sure to post glowing articles about how progressive they are becoming because as you remember all the articles about women now being allowed to drive in Saudi Arabia as long as their guardian or parent or her husband allowed them to but hey women are technically allowed to drive oh and remember this Saudi stadiums allow women in soccer game for the first time Thank You Chicago Tribune for pointing this out yes women were allowed to be in a stadium well gee whiz I guess these women who are supposed to be fighting for women's rights and in justices around the world can go back to marching for things like I don't know completely free abortions on demand whenever they want them because that's absolutely vital and important in the meantime I'll be sure to post and talk about these injustice happening all around the world hopefully I can shine a little bit of light on them including stories like this poor woman who is now in jail for hugging in public I'm Ben days this is pure Hollywood in awesome news like super awesome news you can now download the rebel media app and take me with you and have access to the entire rebel lineup you
