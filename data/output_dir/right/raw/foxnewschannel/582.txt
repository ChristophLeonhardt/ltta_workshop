1
00:00:01,650 --> 00:00:02,383
AND IN SEPTEMBER IN PYONGYANG,

2
00:00:02,384 --> 00:00:06,220
HIGH HOPES BECOMING MORE FIRM

3
00:00:06,221 --> 00:00:12,493
MIGHT COME FROM HIM.

4
00:00:12,494 --> 00:00:14,228
>> MILLIONS OF MIGRANTS TO STAY

5
00:00:14,229 --> 00:00:16,264
IN THE UK, LEADERS CAN'T MAKE A

6
00:00:16,265 --> 00:00:18,666
DEAL ON BREXIT.

7
00:00:18,667 --> 00:00:19,367
JILLIAN: WHAT IS THE POINT OF

8
00:00:19,368 --> 00:00:23,805
BREXIT TO STRENGTHEN BORDERS?

9
00:00:23,806 --> 00:00:24,539
REACTION, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR

10
00:00:24,540 --> 00:00:30,211
AND UK INDEPENDENCE PARTY LEADER

11
00:00:30,212 --> 00:00:32,246
NIGEL FARAGE.

12
00:00:32,247 --> 00:00:35,216
HOW DID IT GET TO THIS POINT?

13
00:00:35,217 --> 00:00:35,783
>> Reporter: SOMEBODY

14
00:00:35,784 --> 00:00:40,822
NEGOTIATING BREXIT WAS WEEK.

15
00:00:40,823 --> 00:00:42,190
THE IDEA WAS IF WE HAD A DEAL

16
00:00:42,191 --> 00:00:45,126
WITH THE EUROPEAN UNION ON

17
00:00:45,127 --> 00:00:45,860
TRADE, PEOPLE WOULD BE ALLOWED

18
00:00:45,861 --> 00:00:46,194
TO STAY.

19
00:00:46,195 --> 00:00:54,202
NOW WE ARE TOLD EVEN IF THERE IS

20
00:00:54,203 --> 00:00:54,936
NO DEAL NOT ONLY CAN 3.8 MILLION

21
00:00:54,937 --> 00:00:55,636
PEOPLE STAY BUT THEY WILL BE

22
00:00:55,637 --> 00:00:56,404
ALLOWED TO BRING THEIR EXTENDED

23
00:00:56,405 --> 00:00:57,171
FAMILIES, THEY HAVE FULL ACCESS

24
00:00:57,172 --> 00:00:59,907
TO SOCIAL SECURITY AND BENEFIT

25
00:00:59,908 --> 00:01:06,547
SYSTEM AND EVEN WORSE, THERE IS

26
00:01:06,548 --> 00:01:07,248
NO PROPOSED CUT OFF DATE FROM

27
00:01:07,249 --> 00:01:10,218
WHICH ANY OF THIS IS CHANGING.

28
00:01:10,219 --> 00:01:10,952
IT IS QUITE REMARKABLE BECAUSE

29
00:01:10,953 --> 00:01:11,486
THE BRITISH PUBLIC

30
00:01:11,487 --> 00:01:13,154
OVERWHELMINGLY VOTED WITH

31
00:01:13,155 --> 00:01:13,888
BREXIT, TAKE BACK CONTROL OF OUR

32
00:01:13,889 --> 00:01:18,192
BORDERS, REDUCE THE HUGE INFLOW

33
00:01:18,193 --> 00:01:18,960
COMING INTO THIS COUNTRY AND

34
00:01:18,961 --> 00:01:22,196
THEY ARE BEING WILLFULLY IGNORED

35
00:01:22,197 --> 00:01:22,897
BY THE BRITISH GOVERNMENT AND

36
00:01:22,898 --> 00:01:23,564
BRITISH PARLIAMENT.

37
00:01:23,565 --> 00:01:26,200
ROB: TERESA MAY WANTS TO WATER

38
00:01:26,201 --> 00:01:31,539
IT DOWN AS MUCH AS SHE CAN.

39
00:01:33,609 --> 00:01:34,308
UP WITH A PRIME MINISTER WHO

40
00:01:34,309 --> 00:01:38,212
VOTED IN MAY AND WHEN ASKED EVEN

41
00:01:38,213 --> 00:01:40,615
TODAY DOES SHE BELIEVE IN BREXIT

42
00:01:40,616 --> 00:01:42,216
CAN'T ANSWER THE QUESTION.

43
00:01:42,217 --> 00:01:46,420
I WALKED INTO A SHOP TO BUY

44
00:01:46,421 --> 00:01:47,155
SOMETHING AND THE ONE BEHIND THE

45
00:01:47,156 --> 00:01:47,889
COUNTER SAID OF DONALD TRUMP WAS

46
00:01:47,890 --> 00:01:48,656
NEGOTIATING FOR US WE WOULD HAVE

47
00:01:48,657 --> 00:01:51,659
IT ALL SORTED OUT BY NOW.

48
00:01:58,767 --> 00:02:06,174
EUROPE OVER THE PAST FOUR YEARS

49
00:02:06,175 --> 00:02:06,908
THAT RESULTED IN 182 DEATHS, AND

50
00:02:06,909 --> 00:02:08,876
814 INJURIES AND IN 2015 ISIS

51
00:02:08,877 --> 00:02:09,577
EXPLOITED REFUGEE ROOTS TO GO

52
00:02:09,578 --> 00:02:10,378
BACK AND FORTH FROM SYRIA TO

53
00:02:10,378 --> 00:02:18,219
GERMANY UNHINDERED.

54
00:02:18,220 --> 00:02:18,953
YOU GAVE SPEECHES ON THAT POINT

55
00:02:18,954 --> 00:02:22,190
IN THE PAST.

56
00:02:22,191 --> 00:02:24,692
>> IN APRIL AND MAY 2015 THE EU

57
00:02:24,693 --> 00:02:25,426
WERE BEGINNING TO SAY OUR DOORS

58
00:02:25,427 --> 00:02:26,127
ARE OPEN TO ANYONE WHO COMES,

59
00:02:34,203 --> 00:02:36,938
WILL USE THE MIGRANT CRISIS AS A

60
00:02:36,939 --> 00:02:37,672
MEANS OF GETTING OPERATIVES INTO

61
00:02:37,673 --> 00:02:38,339
EUROPE, PERHAPS WE OUGHT TO

62
00:02:38,340 --> 00:02:38,773
BELIEVE THEM.

63
00:02:42,811 --> 00:02:43,744
THE AUSTRALIANS DID WHEN THEY

64
00:02:43,745 --> 00:02:47,949
HAD A SIMILAR PROBLEM, NO ONE

65
00:02:47,950 --> 00:02:50,484
WILL BE ALLOWED TO STAY, NONE OF

66
00:02:50,485 --> 00:02:51,219
THAT HAPPENED AND WE DO NOT HAVE

67
00:02:51,220 --> 00:02:55,623
A CLUE HOW MANY BAD PEOPLE ARE

68
00:02:55,624 --> 00:02:56,791
BEING LET INTO EUROPE.

69
00:02:56,792 --> 00:03:01,863
IT IS MADNESS AND ANOTHER REASON

70
00:03:01,864 --> 00:03:02,597
WHY BREXIT IS THE COMMON SENSE

71
00:03:02,598 --> 00:03:03,331
AND SAFEST THING TO DO FOR OUR

72
00:03:03,332 --> 00:03:05,900
PEOPLE.

73
00:03:05,901 --> 00:03:11,239
ROB: THE ANTI-BREXITERS WILL

74
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:11,906
ADMIT YOU CAN'T KNOW WHO IS

75
00:03:11,907 --> 00:03:17,678
COMING IN IF YOU OPEN THIS PLACE

76
00:03:17,679 --> 00:03:18,379
UP TO ALL THIS MIGRATION, YOU

77
00:03:18,380 --> 00:03:19,113
CAN'T KNOW AND THE PROOF IS IN

78
00:03:19,114 --> 00:03:19,847
THOSE NUMBERS WE JUST GAVE AND

79
00:03:19,848 --> 00:03:22,216
PUT IT TO THE PEOPLE AGAIN, ARE

80
00:03:22,217 --> 00:03:26,220
WE COMFORTABLE BRINGING IN A LOT

81
00:03:26,221 --> 00:03:28,623
OF PEOPLE KNOWING SOME

82
00:03:28,624 --> 00:03:29,357
PERCENTAGE OF THEM WILL TRY TO

83
00:03:29,358 --> 00:03:30,191
DO HORRIBLE THINGS WHEN THEY ARE

84
00:03:30,192 --> 00:03:30,491
HERE?

85
00:03:30,492 --> 00:03:38,766
>> THE OTHER SIDE OF THE AISLE

86
00:03:38,767 --> 00:03:39,400
BELIEVE WE ARE ALL GLOBAL

87
00:03:39,401 --> 00:03:42,203
CITIZENS, LOVELY AND FLUFFY AND

88
00:03:42,204 --> 00:03:43,804
NICE, WE SHOULD GO WHEREVER WE

89
00:03:43,805 --> 00:03:44,538
WENT AND MOVE FREELY AROUND THE

90
00:03:44,539 --> 00:03:46,207
WORLD AND WHEN YOU LINK THIS

91
00:03:46,208 --> 00:03:50,211
DIRECTLY TO TERRORISM OF ANY

92
00:03:50,212 --> 00:03:51,612
KIND THEY SIMPLY SAY YOU ARE

93
00:03:51,613 --> 00:03:52,280
RACIST, TURNAROUND AND WALK

94
00:03:52,281 --> 00:03:54,215
AWAY.

95
00:03:54,216 --> 00:03:56,550
THEY ARE NOT PREPARED TO ENGAGE

96
00:03:56,551 --> 00:03:57,285
THIS CONVERSATION BUT PEOPLE IN

97
00:03:57,286 --> 00:03:59,587
THIS COUNTRY, PEOPLE IN MIDDLE

98
00:03:59,588 --> 00:04:00,288
ENGLAND, THEY KNOW WHAT THEY

99
00:04:00,289 --> 00:04:02,290
BELIEVE.
