then he's definitely Deborah Goldberg reported today on his attempted to find this so-called Trump doctrine of foreign policy he writes the best distillation of the Trump doctrine I heard though came from a senior White House official with direct access to the president and his thinking I was talking to this person several weeks ago when I said by way of introduction that I thought it might perhaps be too early to discern a definitive Trump doctrine no the official said there's definitely a Trump doctrine what is it I asked here's the answer I received the Trump doctrine is we're America expletive that's the Trump doctrine from why I'm drummer The Hardball roundtable Jonathan Swan is - the political reporter for Axios ginger Gibson's political correspondent for Reuters and he likes Douglas White House correspondent for the LA Times and MSNBC political analyst all of you thank you put that together Jonathan I'm not sure that relates this that language we just heard about it's basically us the heck with you and I mean that that's basically what it says in worst language how does that fit with this almost date that we're watching with Kim jong-un where he wants to be friends with this guy well I think very clearly you saw that doctorate and play out over the weekend which is Donald Trump effectively seeing the world as a group of countries that Oh America money and he looks at North Korea as an enemy but one that he is uniquely placed Donald J Trump as you know in his mind the greatest negotiator and deal maker in his it an honorable country in his eyes and trying to pull me an honorable people Trump doesn't see the world like that you know that Chris he says in the world he said this is honorable the guy's about me with his honorable tonight but because he uses adjectives doesn't mean that he sees the world in that in that way and and you know Chris from having observed Trump for a long time he doesn't sort of give countries a mental score based on their human rights record and and various other issues he sees America as a country that needs to defend itself and stand up for itself and get the best deal possible and again he you look at the transatlantic relationships these are long historical relationships that Donald Trump is reducing to things like a dispute over dairy tariffs so it is a completely different mindset than that we've ever seen from a u.s. president ginger ginger I wonder game talk about but I want you to get into this question of why so many people seem to want to get out of the White House it's another story tonight is / cleaning up their parking up why do people who have this privileged position of working in the White House the most treasured sort of event a space in America if you will the New York Times reporting that is Trump attempts his diplomatic gambit abroad back home he left behind a West Wing and the White House where burned-out aides are eyeing the exits as the mood in the White House was one of numbness and resignation that the president's growing only more embolden to act on instinct alone the report adds that last week chief of staff John Kelly told visiting senators that the White House says quote was quite a miserable place to work ginger that's where my guy who's over there representing our country back home there's something wrong in the White House we know that Donald Trump thinks that managing by chaos is a good tactic and I don't know about you but working in a place with chaos can become pretty miserable pretty quick the other thing that's important to remember is that people get into public service in the White House for two reasons one to serve their country but second and sometimes at the same time to cash out when they're done and it's becoming increasingly difficult to get that cash out if the White House is not functioning if you're not producing if your resume isn't getting a boost from having White House under Donald a Trump as the last line leaving sooner rather than later can help mitigate that problem really think there that many people in the White House are there just to get their resume punched absolutely not I think people go in for public service but you can't live on public service alone for the rest of your life you have to get a job somewhere else afterwards and when you've got a president we're talking about fighting with our allies it makes it harder to get that next job with someone that's gonna have to go be diplomatic with Congress or with those allies in the future you like you hearing that what are you hearing about this time story that they're really restive in the White House they're very unhappy yeah you're seeing that you're seeing positions using people leave and then positions not be filled I think the through line with all of this stories all these stories that we're talking about here the fact that Donald Trump can't bring new people into the White House that Donald Trump can't get along with long-standing US allies the through line here is that Donald Trump at the end of the day believes in nothing more than the primacy of Donald Trump that's why he's excited by these negotiations of possibility to sit down with Kim that's why he doesn't care about a values-based alliance that stretches back decades these things do not matter to a person who really thinks that he's smarter than everybody else doesn't need the advice of his top aides he tweeted just an hour or two ago that the only thing that will count today is when he sits down with Kim he specifically referenced the pre meetings of advisors and aides and said those are great but the only thing that what matter is when I sit down with Kim this is a person who doesn't listen to his chief of staff he didn't convene a single National Security Council meeting before going over there doesn't have an advisor who's an expert on chemical weapons he's doing this all on his own instinct he's saying as much and that makes him a very difficult person to deal with whether you're a long-standing US ally or a chief of staff or another staffer in the white chair and this is real put-down to people that are serving him a real put-down these things going to helping me here I don't need to have briefing books I don't need any help these people are a bunch of losers around here I'm the only winner that's an amazing statement for a leading it keep leaving a team how do you do that and then expect that team that performed for you well you saw it recently he it's not just sort of low-level staffers I mean he a sent a team of five of his senior most officials in the administration to China to negotiate trade it was the Treasury secretary Stephen manoosh in the economic adviser Larry Kudlow and Wilbur Ross the Commerce Secretary they come back and Trump says we've had no meetings there have been no meetings just wait until I do the deal well that was news to the group that was over there in you know very intense discussion so again this comes back to Donald Trump's theory of international relations which is a series of man-to-man contests around the world he's always seen himself as the only figure I mean he literally said at the Republican convention 2016 I alone can fix it hey there I'm Chris Hayes from MSNBC thanks for watching MSNBC on YouTube if you want to keep up to date with the videos
