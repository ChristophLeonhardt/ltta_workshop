it's gonna be tremendous in order on show in order to prove myself right I'm gonna take the day off getting better better know yesterday was bananas every story was made of boolean gold okay today's just oranges that's my I get to talk about Mick Mulvaney yeah finally the mick yeah there's there's stuff that we got to get to okay so when you do it in one sec I just want to already remember tonight's election night so that at 8 o'clock Eastern 8:05 we're gonna go on air it's gonna be me John and Ben and we got a bunch of really important states iron stashes up tonight okay so Willie win

Randy Gonzalez to tune in tonight to TYT calm /live after all these years well someone get Randy Gonzales to watch okay all right do you think anyone gets that reference anymore it is Sol golden days I know you know what that was that was the golden days of all right we move forward Casper Theodore yes recently Donald Trump signed the defense reauthorization act and in that signing ceremony and in his speech he applauded himself and his White House for doing more for our troops and for our veterans but the reality is that there are a number of regulations that are put in place in order to protect our troops from predatory lending that the Trump administration wants to do away with and recently they have done away with something that would protect them something known as the military Lending Act they have decided to stop supervising financial institutions that continuously prey on our soldiers okay so let me give you the details of what's going on first there's McMullen II he is the interim director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau that is the very bureau that is supposed to be supervising predatory lenders to ensure that they're not going after our troops and essentially pressuring them to take out loans that they can't afford loans that usually have incredibly high interest rates well the bureau's supervisory staff typically conducted these checks to make sure that the lenders aren't charging military members exorbitant interest rates pushing them into forced arbitration or otherwise not following guidelines outlined in the military Lending Act a 2006 law that protects active-duty military members and their families from financial fraud predatory loans and credit gouging so now the CFPB is saying yeah we're not really gonna supervise anymore you know like we're just gonna let these lenders to what they want to do it's true it's Omarosa has it on TV they sound exactly like that they don't have no I'm Rosa doesn't have it on tape but we do have tape featuring Mick Mulvaney very openly sharing what his thoughts are on the CFPB the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau remember he is the temporary head of the agency while the Trump administration looks for someone to take his place and so during Senate hearings here is what Mick Mulvaney had to say about the CFPB do you still believe that CFPB is a sad sick joke yes sir I do and I'll be happy to tell you why it is to me sir one of the most offensive concepts I think in a representative government which is almost completely unaccountable government bureaucracy so Mick Mulvaney goes to the CFPB again this is an agency that's incredibly important it was put together after the financial collapse in 2008 in order to protect consumers from predatory lending right and Mick Mulvaney goes in there and he's like yeah don't like any of this it's mantling it sorry and so that's what he's doing right now and so don't be fooled when you hear that the administration cares about our military cares about the troops cares about our veterans no they don't they care about the very financial institutions that fund their campaigns Mick Mulvaney stop donors include payday lenders and so of course he's gonna want to deregulate of course he's gonna want to stop supervising and protecting our troops from these predatory lenders I mean it's it's of course gonna happen so okay first of all the whole point is to protect consumers so if your republican are you proud or we're not protecting consumers anywhere okay if you say well the average american i don't give a damn about them let the bankers crush them I don't know what kind of conservative you are it's not really a conservative position but in this case it's veterans and these scumbags the predatory lenders that's what they are target veterans at four times the rate of in a vs. so when you see a veteran you see someone you respect and that sacrifice for their country when they see a veteran they see a target they see a mark and Mick Mulvaney just came in and said have at it Hoss you want to target veterans there are a lot of veterans that are livid over this and and army Colonel Paul Cantwell for example said why do you think we have people standing guard in the military and what he just did was he just took the people that were standing guard off the guard and just let people run in and and defraud our veterans any way they like basically and and that's his job and why is it his job who pays his bills the payday lenders the predatory lenders pay Mulvaney's campaign donations he works for them he doesn't work for you you think he cares about veterans you know he cares about his donors that's the only thing he cares about and it's not just better veterans are certainly included in you know these predatory tactics but this also involves active-duty members of our military who oftentimes are very young they're out of high school they have no credit history and so since they're so young and financially inexperienced they are a prime target of these payday lenders of these you know predatory lenders of these institutions and so this military Act of 2006 was so important and luckily it's still in place and the whole point of that was to ensure that these scumbags don't continuously target them with insanely high unaffordable interest rates and so in 2015 the Obama administration really did beefed up that regulation to ensure that the CFPB was supervising these organizations to to prevent them from you know just leeching off of our military by the way the bureau now says that it will only be able to take action against lenders when it receives a complaint so they're not gonna do anything unless you know you go through the insane bureaucracy of reaching out to them and filing a complaint yeah and by that time is some of the veterans are and their advocates are pointing out it's too late your life's already been ruined they've already foreclosed on your house they've already taken everything you have etc now I'm gonna tell you in a second how much money that the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau had saved veterans Anna's right active service members as well okay so it's a startling number that's the number that the bankers had ripped them off of and it Consumer Financial Protection Bureau gave them back okay and so I'm gonna say that for you in just a second but understand that's what they do they look out for the service members so the military Lending Act which was in place but actually when you proactively regulate as was happening in this case it helped you to enforce the military Lending Act and that's why the bankers hated it because they couldn't more effectively ripoff people who'd served in the military which again they found to be really easy marks so for whatever reason with the guidelines were you can't charge military members an annual interest rate of more than 36% so it's not a tough standard 36 percent interest rate is gigantic Donald Trump bankrupted Taj Mahal because he took an interest alone that had too high an interest rate you know what it was 14% and and it was totally unable and unsustainable but yeah they're willing to charge that to our service members and to average American citizens and we're keeping him down to 36 percent if we didn't have this law they sometimes to charge up to 300% so then the other provisions they can't push them into forced arbitration this forced arbitration is rigged in favor of corporations often times they can't require them to a lot portions of paychecks to pay back their loans so that means they would just start taking it out of the service members checks if they couldn't pay it back but they might need that money for family for their food for their family for rent otherwise they might be homeless etc but they would just grab their paychecks and the military lending I prohibited that okay and then the last one was creditors can't charge a penalty for early payment now that's mental if I have the money and I'm willing to pay you so I don't have to keep paying that ridiculous interest rate why can't I just pay you they said no I'm gonna charge you a penalty for being a good guy and paying you're headed you know why because they want their interest yes because they want to rob you blind so the military Lending Act is great and what is it it's regulation to protect veterans and servicemembers so then on top of that it was regulated in a way that they didn't wait for your life to be ruined they were proactive so what did that do how much does that save let's go to graphic six okay proponents of the system say that it worked out well and they say that the agency says it delivered more than a hundred and thirty million dollars in relief to servicemembers since 2011 and handled more than 71,000 consumer complaints from that and their families is also taking enforcement actions after discovering lenders that broke the law so several layers of regulation that you see there what the point of regulation it is just laws meant to protect you so you do regulation so that your local plant can't put toxic liquid into the nearby stream which your kids swim it that's a regulation in this case you regulate the predatory lenders so they don't prey on our service members that's the regulation you could do it before in the middle and after and there's different gradations of it and now make Mulvaney and the Trump administration said yeah don't worry about it let's see if they catch them afterwards they'll catch them for a lot less that's a hundred and thirty million dollars those lenders are gonna rob from our service members do you support the troops or don't you support the troops and the reality is progressives actually care about them they're American citizens and and and they signed up to protect us etc so we want to protect them and what do conservatives say and I don't think it's real conservatives to be fair to consumers hey I think it's the corrupt Republican politicians they go yeah I don't give a damn about those people it's a punch line for us that ribbon you put on your car support our trips don't care these guys pay our bills bankers pay my bills bankers go rob them go rob them so they save 130 million dollars for you guys you think bankers pay with all their army of lawyers you don't they pay a hundred thirty million dollars because they didn't do it so they're gonna do it again and they're gonna rob them again cuz they just took the cops off the street that's what these guys are Mick Mulvaney is one of the most corrupt people we've ever had in government trained to swap my ass this is exactly what the swamp is and by the way the military Lending Act is wonderful why doesn't apply to all of us yeah it's a great point that's a great point and look the whole point of the CFPB was to protect all of us but I got to give credit to Elizabeth Warren the CFPB was her idea and she did grill Mick Mulvaney rather aggressively during Senate hearings and what you're about to watch is an example of all the different ways Mulvaney has gone after the CFPB take a look in 2012 you voted in favor of a Republican budget that called for eliminating the agency see entirely is that right I don't have a specific recollection but that sounds familiar to me I'm familiar okay but that was only the beginning you also voted for Republican budgets that eliminated the CFPB in 2013 2014 and 2015 that sound right again yes ma'am there were occasional Republican budgets I didn't vote forward I don't know what was in them but Jimmy's hi can I see your point yes ma'am all right and in 2015 you'll also supported a standalone bill that would have killed off the CFPB is that right that's correct I think it was a co-sponsor of them yeah he is now the interim head of the CFPB which is fitting for the Trump administration why do you think they want to destroy the organization that protects consumers come on man get your head out of your ass if you're a maggot guy you're getting that Red Hat dirty okay get your head out of your ass they're not here to protect you they're here to protect their donors come on man it's brazen so you wanna protect consumers from bankers know we're the Republican party we love bankers there's no other explanation oh you think oh the banks are too regulated poor predatory lenders what if they can't rip off servicemembers and charge them 300 percent interest rate poor poor payday lenders does anyone in the country believe that anyone you think that the victims are the bankers and and the real thugs who shouldn't be protected our our servicemembers and veterans is that what you think okay fine then I guess you're that kind of animal so Mick Mulvaney one of the most corrupt guys Donald Trump who appointed him appointed him to be that corrupt and he's very happy with him to destroy any protection that weather service members or any US citizens get from the guys on Wall Street who want a rob you blind have done it before and now they're gonna get to do it even more yeah well let's go from one disastrous administration official to another one ben Carson has announced that he would like to rollback Obama era fair housing rules now Carson is the head of the Department of Housing and Urban Development and the whole point of that organization is to protect people in the United States and that they have fair housing affordable housing but Carson wants to do the opposite so he announced that a HUD had formally begun the process of revamping the affirmatively furthering fair housing rule a July 2015 regulation that had required communities and local governments receiving federal funding to identify and address any barriers to fair housing like racial segregation so there are racial segregation issues a lot of these issues do have a lot to do with socioeconomic status minorities tend to have less income than white individuals for instance so you'll see a segregation as a result of that in various communities and so the Obama administration wanted to address that and ensure that there were affordable housing options in all communities and Ben Carson wants to do away with that so HUD announced in January that it was suspending the obligation of most local governments to comply with the rule until 2020 or in many cases 2025 also the Trump administration plans to pivot away from the efforts to integrate lower-income housing into wealthier neighborhoods and instead push for an increase in housing supply overall so I want to stop right there this is an argument that I see all over the place from politicians both Democrat and Republican and the argument is there's low supply and as a result housing prices are skyrocketing but that is not what's happening oftentimes the new developments are not affordable housing developments oftentimes they are luxury condos they are luxury apartments places like downtown Los Angeles for instance have a very high vacancy rate because they've built all these luxury apartments that no one can afford right so it's it's a way that developers actually weirdly save money because they can claim that there was a loss or whatever it is in their taxes in California in Los Angeles specifically all new developments are expected to have some affordable housing integrated which is great do you know how many of those units have to be affordable 15 percent fifteen percent that's it fifteen percent 15 percent is not gonna help get people off the streets in Los Angeles we have a huge homeless issue in in this in this city but anyway just wanted to address that because it's all bs when they say oh we need new developments they're always luxury developments that no one can afford so along those lines I actually talked to a fairly wealthy businessman over the weekend and you know what he said in response to what Ana said she's a hundred percent right thank you okay yes yes okay so he said well well I see what's happening here they're building a whole bunch of housing and it's for people like me who could afford it and what do they get they get tax credits why are they getting tax credits for housing that we're going to buy or rent anyway so why do they need tax credits to build housing for wealthy people that doesn't make any sense and he said you know how many homeless people are on my block he said five they live there they live on the streets so where's their housing the problem isn't that rich people in Los Angeles don't have enough housing the problem is that poor people don't have enough housing so it's now what is the Trump administration do first of all of course they get an african-american guy to go and say do you really need fair housing it's a nice little trick right hide behind minorities so look the Democratic Party does it from time to time too okay but in this case it's the Republican Party at doing it fairly brazenly to me if he had made a case for look here's my economic model for why more housing is going to lower prices and let me show you three models where it worked right here's where it worked in Portland or San Antonio etc well I'd say okay you know I don't think that's a crazy idea now Ana it makes a good point that it hasn't worked out that way at all and but if you could show me cases I could see it conceivably working the problem is you can't show me cases of that working because it doesn't work and and that's not how its structured its structured so the politicians get rich from the guys who give them real estate is gigantic donors of politicians it is one of the most understated donors in the country they they don't get talked about that often they contributed a lot at the state and local level and in return they get billions of dollars of tax credits and don't actually have to give you enough of any affordable housing yes and finally that that quote that I read from you it read for you is is to me the most critical one that they plan to quote pivot away from efforts to integrate lower-income housing into wealthier neighborhoods yeah like it we're done with it we're not this is HUD is supposed to be for not for rich people it's supposed to be for working poor middle class to help you to get housing and here they are they're saying we're pivoting away from that what do you primitive do Carson is brazen in you know just his utter disregard for low-income communities let's go to graphic 12 this is another quote Carson has denounced government efforts to desegregate housing in America as quote failed socialist experiments yeah because you know in the South when there was segregation it probably would have worked out on its own you know I'm sure that at some point they would be like wait why are we keeping African Americans out of the pools and out of the diners and out of the homes and out of the schools Oh golly gee I don't know why don't we just change our mind out well you know we tried that for a couple hundred years we tried that on slaver for a couple hundred years it turns out they didn't change their mind we tried it on during the Jim Crow years sure and then throw all throughout a hundred years after slavery and it turns out they don't just change their mind and go hey you know what let's move into black neighborhoods and let's have blacks move into our neighborhoods no it turns out you did you do desegregation and this guy the puppet that he is gets hired to come out there and go um what he's awake um I don't think we should do desegregation notice that I am black so it's okay don't do desegregation anymore expect of housing that's also happening cities like LA as they as housing in leased building in revamping committees spray to South LA to our now Inglewood and Nexus Compton this is just local right now I'm George happening every other city so then usually what people considered was black and brown communities will get run by all these housing increases further pushing people out even further so it's actually the opposite effect is happening we're talking about how possibly they're slowing pivoting away from desegregation and it's not bringing anything is they'll talk about low-income housing the mindset is that all these are like these are projects or something whatever place people can just live in everyone's not just homeless on the streets and trying to get into a place and then squat which are just normal living situations because of all these jobs that Trump is town and then he's done for the black and brown committing his whole two years in office what does that do people being able to live where they are instead the opposite effect is happening people getting pushed further and further out transportation and get to these places is even harder to get to work everything is affected by where you live we know how that works but if the continuing advantages are given to people who have all the advantages already no one else and get anything else and it's their fault and not forgetting pushed out no you just made such a great point that I didn't even consider in the context of this article you know people like Ben Carson and you know the wealthy donors they're worried about low-income individuals infiltrating their rich neighborhoods but what's really happening throughout the country and especially in Los Angeles is that you know wealthier people are infiltrating poor neighborhoods and gentrifying it and pushing low-income people out of the neighborhoods that they've lived in their entire lives right now look gentrification is a difficult complex issue it's not all good or all bad but there is a housing crisis in the country right now and the way that they're handling it is only exacerbating this issue yeah and the chera and I had a great conversation about gentrification in one of the old school episodes if you're remembering it all those who episodes TYT calm /join to become a member get all of our shows and and it partly depends the reason and this is not all bad is if you are a home owner in place like Compton and no gentrification your prices went up if you're a renter you're in trouble you're gone and then you got to move hours away from LA to be able to afford any housing at all so it pushes poor people further and further away I remember we had affordable housing in there in East Brunswick the suburb that I grew up in in New Jersey nobody exploded there was no problems right and and and and it helped to create a diverse background where people were friends with each other from different you know we had middle class we had rich people there we had poor people and it was like it's fine but people are so obsessed with no oh mine oh mine and that's why they get guys like Ben Carson to do their bidding and and it's gross I'll reiterate again these poor housing people that can't afford housing is suddenly their community has houses that are eight hundred thousand dollars you're like oh I can't afford that in a gar you schlep that's the thought process we don't know the numbers behind it eight hundred thousand dollars time a minimum in these communities now it's not it's not the case it's not a case that you're you're a lazy ass and you don't know how to do anything it's that you're not able to afford nearly million dollar houses think about that across the country about how that works well has a 20% down payment for an eight hundred thousand dollar house from laying around who does it's in a lower income neighborhood it's it's preposterous so and and and that's how gentrification works and so but on the upside now we will get bankers who could now sing straight out of Compton on a Bentley all right we got to take a break when we come back more stories for you including Trump's recent attack on Jeff Sessions you're right in the middle of this podcast we got another great segment coming up for you if you'd like to full show which is actually five segments go to TYT Network com slice join you become a member you support the show you support independent media and you get the whole to our show ad free every day let's go do it now I'm back on a Young Turks plenty of comments here let me go to Twitter first dragon lady racer says the fact that we have a separate law to protect service people from these types of lenders besides the ones against all consumers shows just how bad these type of bankers are how is doing away with the Consumer Protection Bureau not a big deal for the Republican voters they have debt - yeah but that's the theme and they vote against their own self-interest all the time they have no idea I think it's the power of propaganda I mean you have to think about the bubble that you know people live in where they get their news you watch Fox News and all you hear is that the biggest threat to Americans are the others right and so that's a great distraction so people aren't paying attention to the people who are really screwing them over yep Carly win rights in that man in the Hat was mustache doing the monopoly man cosplay in the background they're hilarious thank you I mean we were worked up - worked up in that segment to note how funny that was but he was doing a great job and I am I papito rights in or is it I me anyway they're building these luxury apartments like we're getting paid a livable wage good point and we are unfortunately not that guy that does stuff writes in on YouTube super chat remember it that clip is classic gold yes who said that you should play that on old school this week can be used not only as a tool but as a weapon yes so those are great points and I'd like to note for the record that where is it I had it I can't I can't find it so I just played all right thank you that's right that's right what drastic okay that's what all right we'll break out more of that on old school okay so TYT dot-com slaves joined to become a member Steven Michael Davis says please put a setting on the app for one and a half speed we will look into that I'll put that on the list brother and then Zack Bennett says trumpet is cabin and act like they disdain poor people truth is they love poor people poor people are desperate and easier to control unfortunately there is some truth in that at least it within certain demographics in the country all right let's go forward all right the FBI has fired Peter struck he was the FBI agent who was caught sending text messages anti-trump text messages to a lawyer for the FBI by the name of Lisa Paige and so he did testify in front of our lawmakers and the Trump administration has been going after him aggressively an investigation found that his anti-trump bias played no role in the Russia investigation he was immediately taken off of that investigation as soon as Bob Muller knew about the text messages but Trump is capitalizing off of the whole Peter struck story and I believe is using this to further push for certain members of this investigation to get fired so let me give you some of the recent tweets and then also we'll talk a little bit about how he's attacking Jeff Sessions again so Trump had tweeted that fired FBI agent Peter struck is a fraud as is the rigged investigation he started there was no collusion or obstruction with Russia and everybody yada so bored Jesus I know stop tweeting the same thing you maniac he's treated that like a million goddamn times alright so by the way just this quick side note there has been a GoFundMe page for Peter struck and he was able to raise or at least this page was able to raise $300,000 in less than a day and a half I'm sure the number has increased since we last checked also Trump had tweeted they were all in on it meaning struck and all that Hillary Clinton and clear Hillary Clinton and frame Donald Trump four things he didn't do Gregg Jarrett on Fox and Friends if we had a real attorney general this witch-hunt would never have been started looking at the wrong people okay so that was his response to a fox news segment he's watching he's live tweeting you know he's not TYT live tweeting but he's tweeting so Fox won this yeah and so in that tweet he went after Jeff Sessions okay so there's two parts of the story one is the firing of Peters truck I think it's a terrible idea what does it do it encourages them so far Donald Trump is attacked James Comey and then fired him then he attacked deputy director Andrew McCain who was fired and now Peter struck attacked by Donald Trump fired what are you doing you're just encouraging the monster so everyone he's wrongly attacking you go okay yeah I don't want it to be a distraction I know what the President to tweet about it that's the reality you think Christopher Rae looked at this and was like oh I think what Peter struck did was so bad he had a political opinion alright great then why don't you fire almost everyone in the FBI well how many people in the FBI voted for Obama how many of them voted against Obama by all accounts the majority of FBI agents are Republicans so should we fire every Republican in the building did they ever say anything bad about Obama in their private lives instructed in his private life my guess is overwhelmingly so we're gonna go on a witch-hunt and fire everyone who says something bad about Obama or Hillary Clinton are you kidding me you'd have to fire most of the FBI probably at that point how about Bernie Sanders now Peter struck had terrible things to say about Bernie Sanders I think Bernie Sanders is a great candidate do I think struck should be fired for that no because of course they have political opinions so the old a did was a take those texts and they blew him out proportion and and it's it's so obviously brazenly political and the fact that we have to have these nonsense conversations as if we're not adults and we don't know what's going on and then they get encouraged by Christopher Rea you schmuck they're looking to fire and imprison you do you know that the director of the FBI is of course a Republican Chris Wright okay he's the one that just fired struck Jerry Falwell Jr is talking about how he should be imprisoned not not just fired imprisoned so go ahead and courage them like an idiot how many times have we gone has seen this movie now it's Republicans doing it usually it's Democrats who are like oh I'm so sorry I'm so sorry even though you're totally wrong and I'm totally right I'll fire the person I'll get rid of them because it's a distraction it's such cowardice and weakness so alright so it's the Republicans that are doing it now at the FBI they'll come for you next you idiot now let's go to the tweet not the same thing about collusion but the other one racism I wish we had a real attorney general I mean we've gotten used to a lunatic for president an absolute lunatic in my lifetime I've covered politics for several decades now no president it taxes own Attorney General in public that's insane that's insane and says you're not a real attorney general and what did he call he's called a week and I can ineffectual etc over the weekend who does that what kind of maniac does that and ok put aside the fact that he's clearly mentally unstable put that aside for a second we're putting that aside for the President of the United now the second part of it is hey come on man unless you're a totally dishonest actor or a sad pathetic brainwashed Magga dude okay why do you think if he hates session so much that he's not firing him if he was worried about sessions for other reasons not to cover his own ass but he is concerned that he's not doing a job good job as Attorney General does Donald Trump not know how to fire people I said that's how he got famous by firing people on apprentice he's fired plenty of people from the White House why does he just fire jeff Sessions he doesn't fire him because it's obviously to cover up first crimes and he would be charged with obstruction of justice if he fired his own attorney general that where the Justice Department was investigating I mean he would he would fire jeff Sessions simply because Jeff Sessions recused himself and so and that is why he keeps insulting him trying to get him to quit so that he could set off fraud in fire sessions okay he happened to quit so and I happened to find some Lackey I don't piece out of like these a lot of them have turned on him maybe Rudy Giuliani maybe it'll point what it was idiot sons or something okay that'll drop Junior's the new Attorney General guess what he Fire Service decided new fires Muller I'm cleared you can't see this as political if you can't see this is pathetic political you're in one of a couple of categories one is you're a magnet guy who just doesn't care you're a loser and all you care about is more good boy good boy good you don't care about facts at all you're pathetic or there's a lot of folks in the mainstream media we're like I'm sure he says this she says that I don't know why they fired struck I don't know I didn't want fire stations that look a lot of a point out a lot of them that there's a good reason why he's threatening sessions and trying to bully him etc but overall even they're pulling their punches it's super obvious what's happening and when they pull their punches we get into a false debate this isn't a debate Donald Trump clearly wants to end the investigation he says it every goddamn day it's an investigation of him if there were if the FBI was investigating you do you think you could just end it like hey you know what I'm tired of this yeah you could just fire the people doing the investigation enemy for what money laundering overall doing whatever other nefarious acts I fire you or you try to somehow get the prosecutor fired that would obviously be obstruction of justice and you go to prison for a long long time I'm so tired of it yeah me too you know what let's take a quick break when we come back an update on the whole Omarosa debacle she has a new tape and this time has to do with racial slurs
