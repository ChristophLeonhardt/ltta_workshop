day four five six of the Trump administration and we have new reporting out tonight from the Washington Post that attorney general Jeff Sessions recently told the White House he might quit if President Trump fired his deputy rod Rosenstein who's of course overseeing the Russian investigation The Post reports that according to people familiar with the exchange quote sessions made his position known in a phone call to White House Counsel Don McGann last weekend as Trump's fury at Rosenstein peaked after the Deputy Attorney General approved that FBI raid April 9 on the president's personal attorney Michael Cohen in the phone call with McGann sessions wanted details of a meeting Trump and Rosenstein held at the White House on April 12 according to a person with knowledge of the call sessions expressed relief to learn that their meeting was largely cordial sessions said he would have to have had to consider leaving as the Attorney General had Trump Houston Rosenstein this person said tonight's story says the president has derisive ly nicknamed Jeff Sessions mr. Magoo and rod Rosenstein mr. peepers and about sessions the president has been famously willing to publicly thrash his Attorney General ever since he recused himself from the Russia investigation and on the day of that raid involving Trump's attorney Michael Cohen he went at him again he should have certainly let us know if he was going to recuse himself and we would have used they put a different Attorney General in so he made what I consider to be a very terrible mistake for the country but you'll figure that out this new reporting on sessions reminds us that President Trump is facing a number of serious legal battles that could pose a grave danger to his presidency the FBI raid which as the Washington Post mentioned was approved by rod Rosen Stein was part of a larger criminal investigation into Michael Cohen by federal prosecutors in New York the Washington Post also reports tonight the former attorney for porn star stormy Daniels and Playboy model Karen McDougal who were both by the way paid to keep quiet about their alleged affairs with Donald Trump says he has been cooperating with those New York process Computers it's been reported that many of the president's allies fear that case may ultimately be more damaging to him the New York case then even the Muller investigation writ large and that some even believe that Cohen might start cooperating with the feds earlier on this network tonight Harvard Law Professor Alan Dershowitz told us that that could be why Trump recruited Rudolph Giuliani as counsel in the Russia case where I think the problems may lie are in the Southern District of New York where Rudy Giuliani used to be the United States Attorney I think this does send a powerful message to Michael Cohen the message is hey stay strong we have a really good lawyer in our team on our team to focus on the Southern District of New York where your problems are keep in mind that Michael Cohen and his client Donald Trump are also battling a lawsuit filed by pornstar stormy Daniels well today a federal judge in California refused to grant their request to delay that case until Cohen explains just how his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination could be an issue because of the criminal investigation also Trump has renewed his fight against Jim Comey whose memos detail the president's concern about the Russia investigation and his apparent effort to get the former FBI director to drop his inquiry into then national security adviser Michael Flynn which he denies today the White House unleashed its response what FBI director Comey has done is basically decide as he put in his own book in the beginning that he is driven by being prideful driven by being overconfident driven by his own ego James Comey has a lot of editorializing within these memos and no point within them and in frankly in his testimony last year before Congress both in March and in June after he was fired does he allege that the president asked him to do anything inappropriate when you look at James Comey he has a real credibility problem and the Democratic National Committee has launched a surprise leak attack on the president filing a multi-million dollar lawsuit in federal court alleging it the DNC was a victim of a conspiracy by the Trump campaign Russian officials and WikiLeaks to disrupt Hillary Clinton's campaign in favor of Donald Trump it's a lot to talk about we have the people for it let's bring in our leadoff panel for a Friday night Matt Apuzzo New York Times reporter MSNBC contributor and a man who was just awarded his second Pulitzer Prize Viviane Salama NBC News national political reporter covering the White House and Daniel Goldman former assistant US attorney for the Southern District of New York and since there are home team advantages around here counselor you get to go first what does this report in The Washington Post about sessions mean to you it really demonstrates the gravity of what would happen if Rosa Stein is fired Jeff Sessions has been under attack by his own president by the commander in chief by the head of the executive branch since the very beginning of his tenure as we heard in the clip you played earlier yet he has withstood all of the humiliation all of the embarrassing attacks and he has remained in his position he has not resigned and he's even ruled a contrary to some things that Trump wanted such as appointing another special counsel so this when people ask what will a constitutional crisis look like this starts to give some indication that if just Jeff Sessions is willing to resign over Rosen Stein's firing one can only imagine what else will follow out if that occurs some people on social media tonight instantly said well this is a huge favorite of the president who wants Rosenstein and sessions gone together though cooler heads have said what the president doesn't want is what this will do to the Justice Department and confirmation hearings that will necessarily come along not only the confirmation hearings but the reaction is going to be vociferous both I think from the Democrats obviously but also the Republicans and it is going to grind everything to a halt in Washington generally and it is going to prolong this investigation it is not going to end it any sooner if he does that let me ask you a decidedly uncomfortable question about Alan Dershowitz and here it is on another network as they say there's been an ongoing TV drama between Jeff Toobin author lawyer in his own right for murder sh wit student at Harvard Law School and Dershowitz mr. Tobin has said to professor Dershowitz he has accused him of carrying Donald Trump's water on a lot of TV appearances what we just saw Alan Dershowitz do could be construed as a message to Michael Cohen hang on the Cavalry's coming this is why we hired Rudy number one do you believe that's what's going on and number two does Rudy have that much charm in the Southern District of New York to derail an investigation like this I think Alan Dershowitz has some legitimate points but I think he goes too far in many of the things that he says by saying that everything is criminalized if you want to find it is wrong it's it's flat-out wrong I don't know that Alan Dershowitz is trying to send a message to Michael Cohen or otherwise I think the better message might have been the scooter libby pardon that if you stick around I'll take care of you like I did with scooter libby but at the end of the day the Southern District of New York is going to go forward with their investigation and they're gonna follow it to the end Rudy Giuliani is obviously a very well-respected former US Attorney there but when I was there I dealt with former US Attorney's I dealt with former executives and once you leave the government you're on the defense side you're no different than anyone else so either Muller or or the Southern District they're gonna finish their investigation and and Rudy Giuliani may be able to negotiate some agreement as to an interview or something but he's not going to be able to make the investigation evaporate fair enough and thank you for the honest answer hey Vivian how how does this look this sessions matter specifically politically and within the Trump White House well obviously sessions has been under fire since day one and so he has recused himself from the wrested investigation this is something that has gotten really under the skin of the president he has repeatedly expressed this frustration you just showed one of any clips where he did that but obviously when Jeff Sessions pushes back on these issues and if there's an incident where he says this compromises my integrity as an attorney as a prosecutor as the Attorney General and I I might have to quit as well obviously that just adds to this cloud that is hanging over the White House with regards to this Russia investigation where they are trying so hard to kind of carve some sort of a positive spin on this whole situation and unfortunately it's not really worked out for them they've tried very hard to make this look like Comey for example is leaking information and you have the Michael Cohen situation right now you have the situation with my Robert Muller's investigation where they assert that it's a witch hunt and that they are being framed for all these things when you have just sessions coming out and saying that he will actually step away - it really compromises everything that the White House is trying to achieve in terms of trying to make it look like this is not a legitimate investigation and so it really it was really a starting them startling revelation but something that plays well to Jeff Sessions in this whole entire episode mr. Pooh's oh where does mr. Cohen as we head into a weekend where does he stand legally and what's the anxiety level among intimates of the President as far as how much trouble he may be in but perhaps worse how much trouble he could represent for the president sure you know we could we could get a sense of the seriousness here from the the court hearings and from the filings the search warrant on on Cohen's office's his safe deposit box his computers phones they're looking for evidence of fraud campaign finance violations and they're and they're relatively far along in their investigation so I think it's it's pretty clear to say this is a serious investigation obviously there are people around president around mr. Cohen who who expected this will ultimately lead to some sort of charges and there is a growing sense around you know around Trump world that Cohen represents a threat because this is a guy who has always said I'll take a bullet for the president it's I guess it's sort of easy to say that in the abstract but when you know the Justice Department is the one you know pointing the gun do you really want to take the bullet my colleagues have a really interesting story out tonight about how over the years Cohen did you know did try to serve as this fixer and body man for the president but the president really really didn't treat him all that great you know would berate him or threatened to fire him and so I think the question now is for a president who has always really put a premium on loyalty how much loyalty has he engendered in Michael Cohen does Michael Cohen gonna really be loyal to the president if a threat of indictment or a threat of serious charges comes down or even just the threat of a long and protracted court fight that has a potential to bankrupt and just about anyone hey there I'm Chris Hayes from MSNBC thanks for watching MSNBC on YouTube if you want to keep up to date with the videos we're putting out you can click subscribe just below me or click over on this list to see lots of other great videos
