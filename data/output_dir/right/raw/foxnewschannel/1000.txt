00:00:18,899 --> 00:00:20,367
EXPRESSING A DESIRE TO

5
00:00:20,367 --> 00:00:22,302
EVENTUALLY BRING HOME THE

6
00:00:22,302 --> 00:00:23,604
THOUSANDS OF AMERICAN TROOPS

7
00:00:23,604 --> 00:00:24,738
STATIONED ON THE KOREAN

8
00:00:24,738 --> 00:00:25,105
PENINSULA.

9
00:00:25,105 --> 00:00:25,839
BUT ADMITTING YOU'RE NOT QUITE

10
00:00:25,839 --> 00:00:27,174
THERE YET.

11
00:00:27,174 --> 00:00:28,075
HERE ARE SOME OF WHAT THE

12
00:00:28,075 --> 00:00:28,842
PRESIDENT HAD TO SAY EARLIER

13
00:00:28,842 --> 00:00:31,812
TODAY IN SINGAPORE.

14
00:00:31,812 --> 00:00:33,447
>> WE WILL BE STOPPING THE WAR

15
00:00:33,447 --> 00:00:34,314
GAMES WHICH WILL SAVE US A

16
00:00:34,314 --> 00:00:36,550
TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF MONEY

17
00:00:36,550 --> 00:00:38,952
UNLESS AND UNTIL WE SEE THE

18
00:00:38,952 --> 00:00:43,190
FUTURE NEGOTIATIONS IS NOT GOING

19
00:00:43,190 --> 00:00:47,928
ALONG LIKE IT SHOULD.

20
00:00:47,928 --> 00:00:50,998
PLUS IT'S VERY PROVOCATIVE.

21
00:00:50,998 --> 00:00:51,865
>> Harris: LUCAS TOMLINSON IS

22
00:00:51,865 --> 00:00:52,866
LIVE AT THE PENTAGON WITH

23
00:00:52,866 --> 00:00:56,203
DETAILS ON THE DETAILS.

24
00:00:56,203 --> 00:00:57,771
GOOD TO SEE YOU.

25
00:00:57,771 --> 00:00:59,373
BECAUSE THE PENTAGON CALLS THESE

26
00:00:59,373 --> 00:01:00,040
JOINT EXERCISE OF THE

27
00:01:00,040 --> 00:01:02,175
SOUTH KOREA DEFENSIVE IN NATURE.

28
00:01:02,175 --> 00:01:03,977
THE TERM PROVOCATIVE IS LIKELY

29
00:01:03,977 --> 00:01:05,212
TO RAISE EYEBROWS HERE.

30
00:01:05,212 --> 00:01:06,446
PRESIDENT TRUMP SAYS FOR NOW,

31
00:01:06,446 --> 00:01:08,382
ALL U.S. TROOPS IN SOUTH KOREA

32
00:01:08,382 --> 00:01:09,483
WILL REMAIN DESPITE HIS CALLS TO

33
00:01:09,483 --> 00:01:12,586
SUSPEND THE DRILLS.

34
00:01:12,586 --> 00:01:14,221
>> I'M DOING SOME OF THAT I

35
00:01:14,221 --> 00:01:16,957
WANTED TO DO FROM THE BEGINNING.

36
00:01:16,957 --> 00:01:18,225
WE STOP PLAYING THOSE WAR GAMES

37
00:01:18,225 --> 00:01:20,561
THAT COST US A FORTUNE.

38
00:01:20,561 --> 00:01:22,796
EVERY MONTH WE ARE DOING

39
00:01:22,796 --> 00:01:23,964
WAR GAMES WITH SOUTH KOREA.

40
00:01:23,964 --> 00:01:25,966
I SAID WHAT IS THIS COSTING?

41
00:01:25,966 --> 00:01:28,302
WE ARE FLYING PLANES AND FROM

42
00:01:28,302 --> 00:01:29,570
GUAM AND BOMBING ANTI-MOUNTAINS

43
00:01:29,570 --> 00:01:30,304
FOR PRACTICE AND I SAID I WANT

44
00:01:30,304 --> 00:01:32,372
TO STOP THAT AND I WILL STOP

45
00:01:32,372 --> 00:01:34,641
THAT AND I THINK IT'S VERY

46
00:01:34,641 --> 00:01:35,976
PROVOCATIVE.

47
00:01:35,976 --> 00:01:38,278
ESPECIALLY SINCE WE ARE GETTING

48
00:01:38,278 --> 00:01:38,779
ALONG.

49
00:01:38,779 --> 00:01:42,883

68
00:02:13,981 --> 00:02:14,681
AMERICAN TROOPS IN SOUTH KOREA

69
00:02:14,681 --> 00:02:17,217
WOULD BE AN ISSUE FOR

70
00:02:17,217 --> 00:02:17,751
PRESIDENT TRUMP AND

71
00:02:17,751 --> 00:02:18,885

THEY WERE CANCELED IN THE
