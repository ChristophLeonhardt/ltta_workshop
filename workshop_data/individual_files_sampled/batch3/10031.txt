Russian biopic drama dull flat off hits screens on Thursday the film about Soviet dissident writer sergey da flat off premiered at the Berlin Film Festival where it won the Silver Bear for outstanding artistic contribution its director told us why he was surprised that the film was even shown there Esmond occurs to me pastor typically nyaka taurima's passed arrows colorado the position when you proposed of lotof to the Berlin Film Festival what did you the decisions would be obstructed by the political and particularly personal views of the jury and that's what happened there are a lot of films no worse than our movie and the German pictures all of them were left with no awards whatsoever and the outstanding movie about the brave ik events didn't get anything all of that is kind of hard to explain because I think there were other intentions than just fair competition but I was amazed that da vlaar Tov was even shown there when I walked by the Convention Center where the festival took place I saw a person with a book in German about da flat oaf and another with the same book in English and then a young German guy came up to me and started asking me who'd of lotof was about the culture the 1970s Leningrad culture what kind of struck me was how well our film was received how Universal and relatable it was to everyone women dominated this year's Berlin al with both of the top prizes awarded to female filmmakers nevertheless the lack of female representation generally in the film industry was discussed at a special Festival panel as was the topic of sexual harassment in the wake of the me2 movement Alexey Gutterman jr. again shared his views on those issues this is a tough one on the one hand we've got to treat the sexes absolutely equally there should be no gender preferences obviously on the other hand bearing in mind everything that's going on some sort of support for women is important the topic of sexual harassment was indeed brought up at the festival their culture differs from ours their outlook on things is different if they find it offensive they have every right to do so I think we have fewer problems with this in Russia I've heard some unpleasant stories but very few as strange as it may seem generally in Russia attitudes to women working in the film industry judging by my peers are more transparent and positive than in Hollywood maybe because we have less money the less money there is the less power the less temptation
