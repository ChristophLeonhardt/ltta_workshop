let me quote a bit from the ruling just to give you a few facts let me start with this part of the ruling relying upon the encouragement that they say they received from the highest levels of government the investors invested many years and millions of dollars in pursuing the project only to have the federal and provincial governments ultimately refused to approve it pretty simple and boring fact I guess but important bill Cohn was told come on in invest your money we believe in economic development we support this we'll treat you fairly here are the rules it sounds a lot like Justin Trudeau and Rachel Notley doesn't it but then the opposite was done to Bill Kahn let me quote some more the investors do not dispute that an environmental assessment was required in this case they do however take issue with the way that the assessment was carried out well the bureaucrats and governments and politicians studied the mine project for literally three years three years for a rock quarry of course because they all wanted to milk it for all they could I mean the miners the construction workers those jobs had to wait while the lawyers for the lobbyists feasted on their work and here's what they said according to the federal court ruling yesterday by the way I'm gonna use the word JRP that stands for a joint review panel which is the provincial and federal bureaucrats getting together to do one review jointly instead of two that's what JRP means the government bureaucrats so let me quote the primary conclusion underlying its recommendation that the project be rejected was that a quote would have a significant adverse effect on a valued environmental component represented by the core values of the affected communities as the JRP explained the injection of an industrial project into the region would undermine and jeopardize community visions and expectations and lead to irrevocable and undesired changes in quality of life unquote for the this wasn't the real study about safety or environmental pollution it was about feelings and visions seriously community visions I like that part undesired changes to quality of life yeah you've got 12.1 percent unemployment it would change that and that is desirable that's an excerpt from my daily TV show the Ezra Levant show no one leaves behind a paywall but I thought you'd like this video so we put it on YouTube if you want to subscribe to watch the daily show every day including always two interviews a day and I read my hate mail just click on this screen and become a Premium Member you
