the crime prevention research centers dr. John Lott is joining me we're gonna discuss gun bills pending before Congress that would address flaws in the next background check system and grant National reciprocity the concealed weapons license holders I always love talking to my next guests actually haven't done interviews in a while with the new show so I'm so glad that I was able to have them on as one of my first doctor John Lott runs the Crime Prevention Research Center he is my absolute go to authority on all things firearms and he joins me now dr. Lai thanks so much for being here oh great great to talk to you again yeah no this was great cuz there's so much going on so we've got two pretty important bills hitting the floor one with regards to fixing the next jack system the National instant criminal check system the background check system in short and the other is the reciprocity bill let's talk about the NICS check system first because we saw a really big flaw in that system when Devin Kelly got killed 26 people at a church in southern Springs Texas fell through the cracks he had convictions in a military court with the United States Air Force but he never made it into NICs why right well I mean there was a big flaw there he had done a couple things at least that should have put him on the list one of them that is he had committed a felony he'd served a year in prison for assault he had assaulted his wife and actually cracked the skull of his stepson but the Air Force hadn't put his name in the system that was there it's really it's really mind-blowing to me now what I haven't been able to get an answer on I actually reached out to the Department of Defense and they admitted his name hadn't been entered but what they've never really given us an answer on I don't know if you found out in your researches where the breakdown was was it the mistake of an Air Force employee was it mistake of a deal the employee or is there just not a robust system in place for the military courts to share information with the NCIC and NICs databases you know as far as I can tell the vast majority of people who have felony convictions in the military are put on the list why this one particular case wasn't I I have no idea I don't know any more than you do at this point but you know my concern with the bill that's coming up by the way they've just recently announced that they're combining both the nix fix bill with the reciprocity bill in the house my concern is that there are lots of problems with the NIC system you know we're focused on one right here and and the thing is it's extremely rare for criminals Colonels may be dumb but they're it's extremely rare that they're this stupid that they actually go to an FFL to try to buy a gun when they know they're prohibited yeah it didn't ever happen I mean I think I pulled one I had one incident there are my time on the street in the Bronx one incident with a law abiding gun owner it was a justifiable shooting he was a retired police officer stopping a robbery so I you're hundreds on right legally owned weapons are rarely using crimes right well so the concern that I have is you know when people talk about 3,000,000 dangerous prohibited people have been stopped from having guns because the background checks that's simply incorrect almost all that 3 million are what we refer to as false positives mistakes that were made yeah you can take the last year that there was an annual report put out on the Knicks system in 2010 there were about 73,000 denials only 44 of those cases were referred for prosecution's and they only got 13 convictions Wow a weight of the 73,000 they're saying is like 72,000 fifty six of them were miss IDs were false positives we don't know exactly but almost all the more plausible Wow it and and you also have some state prosecutions but those are about as small as the federal ones that are there right and and you know the issue is if you go and put more names in the system and you don't deal with why you have that many errors in the system you're gonna create a lot more false positives and so you know and but these are relatively easy things to fix when you go and you buy a gun you fill out the 4473 you have your name your race your height your social security number your address your birthday you kind of figure they must be using all that information but they're not they're using roughly phonetically similar names right and they're using your birthday and the problem is is that you can still get a fair number of matches there when you're talking about a country is of 320 million people and in particular you have problems in certain racial groups more because people tend to have names similar to others in their racial groups Hispanics have names some rather Hispanics blacks have names similar to other blacks and you know about 30% of black males in the United States for example are legally prohibited from owning guns because of past criminal history well whose names do you think they're most likely to be confused with other little body black males now let me ask you a question what would the fix be well in your opinion you research this maybe more than anybody else on the planet John I don't know if anybody does the research you do into these issues and firearms issues in a very holistic using a very holistic approach if you were tasked President the United States tomorrow called you up and said hey dr. lot you need to fix the NIC system for me where would you start right well what I would do is probably the simplest thing is require that the federal government have to meet the same standards for being doing background checks that we require private employers if private employers had an error rate that was one the error rate that the federal government has they be sued out of existence and the reason why they don't have that error rate is because they use all that information that's available on the 4473 form you know they use the person's exact name they use their social security number they use their address they use other things like that in order to try to narrow it down and make sure that they're actually getting the person that they're supposed to be get it we call that pedigree information and law-enforcement use as much detailed information as possible so that you know you've got the right person in the system but because the worst thing you can do is miss identify someone all right so now that the bills are combined the next fix is combined with reciprocity let's talk about reciprocity it appears to have enough votes in the house to pass I haven't really studied the Senate side what do you seen on the Senate side right well on the house side they have 213 co-sponsors yeah they need 218 to pass it for sure I mean it's unusually large number of co-sponsors that they have they easily have the votes in the house as you say right in the Senate though Democrats have promised to filibuster it they need to get eight Democrat votes and it's pretty clear that they're not going to get that you know based on past votes when this type of issues come up you would think that they should get at least six Democrats but even a couple of Democrats who have previously consistently supported this have now moved against it well they're just contrary in along party lines they may very well believe that let's talk about reciprocity for a second you know the cop and me has always despised the current system it has always been inconceivable to me that a law-abiding Pennsylvanian is turned into a felon if they make a wrong turn to New Jersey or or New York State or similarly having the gun in their belt we've seen it with the case of Cheney naland young mother Deborah Jersey we've seen it with military veterans but what really gets me what really gets me in the media doesn't talk about it is you have somebody that served multiple tours so there was a young marine that went into New York City right and he was he was locked up for his gun this is a guy who served multiple tours defending this nation a guy with extensive firearms experience the Murray put a lot of rounds downrange and he's being criminalized by some Councilwoman that's probably never seen the inside of a gun shop or a gun range that to me is a fundamental problem with government I mean I agree with you look it's not just the fact that sometimes people make mistakes and the examples that you've given in terms of kind of knowing the difference in laws in different places but you know I get emails all the time from truck drivers for example who may have to drive through a state like New Jersey or New York or Illinois and even though they have a permit and can carry most away and even though they're concerned about having items from their truck stolen if if they you know end up getting in trouble they may be disarmed on the whole trip because of the jurisdiction that they're having to drive through and we saw that we saw that with the Congressional baseball game right wasn't it five members had concealed weapons licenses but because they had to go through DC you get to the game and then back to work in DC they didn't have their firearms and by the grace of God representative Scalise and a security detail were there if not they would have been sitting on armed ducks on that field now you're it's a perfect example it's exactly right we just know that at least five of them have concealed carry permits not everybody most a monument answer the question whether they have them or not and some of the staff did one of the staff members who I talked to at a concealed carry permit and said he always carried when he was back in his home state was about 30 feet away from the killer there or the shooter in that case and he was behind him and he believes had active shooter training and he believes that he could have quickly taken him out but as it was the only thing that he could do basically was hide behind the car that was nearby him he wasn't able to go and stop him but no you're exactly right even though Virginia has very liberal rules they recognize permits from all the other states in the country because they had to go and travel through DC it's a perfect example of what we're talking about there yeah and the Maryland Maryland side is no better Maryland's just as bad as DC if not if not worse in many respects no that's exactly right so you have you have individuals who would normally be able to protect themselves who are disarmed as a result of not Virginia's law but other laws that are there and now what's the public's we know what the politicians sentiment is on this kind of thing they're gonna go along party lines they hate the president so much they'll block anything he supports and they see him as a friend of the NRA and other pro-gun groups but what are you seeing in your research with the American public I mean look anecdotally but then again my audience might be a bit of a right wing echo chamber but anecdotally I like to think I speak to people from across the aisle on social media on air most Americans except for those elitists who live in the cities the LA is the New York the DC's most Americans I talked to just think it's common sense many many and I was very surprised you know we get we we start to get a little comfortable in our little bubbles with the subject matter we know but I was surprised how many even Floridians we have a lot of concealed weapon licenses down here assumed they were like driver's license it just assumed that they drove to New York they were okay as long as they had their license in their wallet and I had to explain them no no when you hit a couple of states when you met Maryland Delaware is reciprocal with us when you at Maryland New Jersey than New York you were facing years in prison but I said so the most of the people I speak to are like well that's just kind of stupid I mean it's a common sense wouldn't it be this is a constitutional right driving is a privilege let's make this universal let's make it reciprocal we saw the politicians fighting but is your research bearing out scientifically what I'm seeing anecdotally I mean most states have reciprocity agreements with most other states the average state has reciprocity agreements with 32 other states but you have a real extreme you have basically seven states that don't have reciprocity agreements with anybody and and then you have most the other states that have reciprocity agreements with almost everybody else and but you know whether you look at the American public's view there are lots of surveys to indicate that a strong majority concealed-carry but you look at police also police one which has about four and fifty thousand members they their survey indicates that ninety-one percent of their members support concealed carry and reciprocity you have the National Association of Chiefs of Police about eighty six percent of their members support reciprocity so you know it's what makes it makes their job easier right and I say this on air often I've never seen a more pro-second amendment group than in three cops who work in bad neighborhoods because they learn very very quickly that when they're backed up five six jobs on their radio and that call for an armed robbery or rape comes over there now getting there in time their response at best is going to be reactive they're not gonna stop the crime in progress and then very quickly you learn when you hit the street that an armed victim tends not to be a victim and our victim tends to be and so those numbers don't surprise me now the number from the Chiefs of Police does because I found that appointed Chiefs tend to mirror the sentiments of the liberal bosses who appoint them so that's a very encouraging stat I hadn't heard that right you have two police organizations you have the International Association of Chiefs of Police and then you have the National Association the International Association is much smaller they have like a hundred members seventy five of them are from the United States the other organization has several thousand members the International Association is against concealed carry they lean literally yeah they've always leaned a bit left on their policies as well though I've never been a fan of the IACP right and the National Association is is very strongly supportive of it though but a much larger organization is and look I agree with your characterization of police look anybody who's read my research knows that I think police are the single most important factor for reducing crime but as you say the police themselves understand that they virtually always arrive on the crime scene after the crimes even committed and they know how important having a gun is for their own safety and they see it regularly how important it is for law-abiding citizens to be able to protect themselves you know I wrote an article for the NRA about two years ago two and a half years ago and I said exactly that it's interesting you bring that up I said you know when I my evolution of being such a vehement defender of the Second Amendment was when I was shot at and I my partner have a shot at eight times by somebody God was 15 feet in front of us I said man if he would do that to us no one were armed trained police officers what's he gonna do to the single mom on the bus stop trying to get to work common sense for me right look if my research convinces me of anything is that they're basically two groups who benefit the most from owning guns the people most likely to be victims of violent crime that overwhelmingly tends to be poor blacks who live in high crime urban areas and people were relatively weaker physically like the example that you gave women and the elderly you're almost always talking about a male criminal doing the attacking and when a man is attacking a female victim there's a larger strength difference than a man attacking another man and the presence of a gun represents a much bigger relative change in a woman's ability to go and resist the attack it's an equalizer it most certainly is and when women are trying to train people and I would just train women on a very simple tactic just get yourself in the far corner of your bedroom and you make a decision if that guy does that bedroom door you fired and when you when you train people and you put it into that context there like a light comes on and they say you know what this isn't an offensive dangerous object that's gonna murder my family while I sleep this makes a lot of sense I feel a lot better and the women I'm very good friends with I just down here in Florida where you can you know lend a friend a gun I just did I just did because you know there are two women they lived by themselves and they were nervous they're their vehicle was stolen from their driveway in a very nice gated area and they said well somebody could jump the fence and feel the car they could probably get into the house you were right we need to have a gun and right with regard to the reciprocity if she's traveling and her car breaks down someplace you know maybe she can't quickly get protection in those cases yeah you know somebody pulls up realizes that the person's helpless there so look you know be great if the police were everyplace all the time but we know that they're not questions what's the best advice so I mean there are lots of issues that are coming up that we're gonna be hearing over the next day or so in the debate in the house on concealed carry but you know they're gonna make claims that permit holders are a danger to others right that you you know you know the bizarre thing is a lot of these senators come from states where you know they already have reciprocity with other states you have like nine US Senate Democratic US senators who and one of those is an independent who come from states that recognize permits in 48 or 49 of the other state and in the you talk about Bernie Sanders yeah yeah and Vermont is a constitutional carry state you don't even need a license in Vermont right I mean they're not gonna vote for this you know despite the fact that they know from their own experience there's no examples of problems occurring in their very own states right now with people with even though they're essentially already have this National reciprocity with respect to their own state we have something like I think three million I could be off two or three million concealed weapons licenses issued now here in Florida it's one point one point over time from the beginning of when they've been issued it's about three million okay that's right the one point eight million about about what is that ten percent of our state is armed and centers in the population areas I live down in South Florida I home the news every morning just for content for the show right I can't remember the last time a legal gun owner it's something illegal with their gun that well we have one case where a police officer shot his ex-girlfriend and killed himself but that was just rage and psychological issues what I'm talking about in terms of wholesale crime you just don't see it it's just not happening and I speak to the law enforcement guys down here it's simply not happening I think Florida Texas even Virginia are great test beds for this so it seems to me the testimony being given by the Dems and the cherry pick witnesses they're going to bring in is really disingenuous how do you see this playing out so you think the household it'll pass in the house it'll die in the Senate well that's what it looks right now I guess the theory is if they can combine it with this NYX fix bill they can get around the filibuster because they'll pass the nyx fixed bill on the Senate they'll pass the kind of the combined bill in the house and then the hope is they'll go to conference and you can't filibuster bills that come out of conferences right but the problem is Democrats see that coming down the road and so they won't agree to go into conference they won't appoint members to be able to go and do that so you know all right unfortunately I don't think anything's gonna happen right now on this one coming up when is it coming up in the house tomorrow votes Wednesday at 5:00 p.m. so you know I guess if they can go and convince some some Democrats to vote for this maybe they'll put some pressure on the Senators to go and do the right thing well let's have you back on next week after this we'll do a post analysis see how it all shook out on the Senate side or if there's any chatter oh that would be great I mean surely be nice to educate people a little bit about the points they're gonna be raised during the debates yeah I don't be great I'm changing the format of the show where we're going a lot longer we're gonna expand the show and we're gonna have guests every day so the audience will be seeing you quite a bit this you know you know we've spoken quite a bit over the years it's a passionate topic for me so one issue of life and death for a lot of people and something more important than you know what people have to realize as you say is how incredibly law-abiding these concealed carry permit holders are and and the issue is what other options do they have when they're not able to defend themselves yet I want to leave the audience with one point and it's personal observation my friends who are concealed weapons license holders who aren't law enforcement trained and shoot far more than my friends who are law enforcement and who typically just undergo the others I have some friends who are fun guys who are cops but by and large the cops go and qualify when they have to my friends who are collectors and CCW concealed weapons holders tend to shoot every weekend if that every other weekend these people know how to handle their firearms they know the laws they know the rules they're incredibly proficient in use and safety of the guns and I know you've seen that as well yeah look I mean you see even in the state many states that don't require any training there's a lot of evidence that these individuals take a lot of time in and here's the reason these are very law-abiding citizens and they know how much they have to lose that's what they do something wrong yeah and so their life will it's very easy to cross the line to become a felon if you make a mistake and using your gun and so these individuals are reticent to use their guns they're not looking forward to going using maybe you use them in last resort and they're very careful in terms of the training you see I've seen states that have removed their training requirement and seen a big increase in the number of people who go to classes because you know more people are caring I know that the rate of caring has gone up and yet you know even though you're not mandating training we're seeing more people carrying as more more people getting training as caring goes up in those states and that for me that that really just sums up the entire argument and that really debunks everything that the left is trying to spew about gun control dr. la John is always an absolute pleasure such great information wouldn't be seeing you back next week have a great such a great interview with dr. lot he is a wealth of information I want to keep bringing imbues so please subscribe to our premium service a www dot
