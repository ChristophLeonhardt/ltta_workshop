this is not the first time we've seen a story like this far from it but reading now from the daily wire report a few days ago it says on Monday when Connecticut had its State Open Track and Field Championships at Willowbrook Park one person broke the state open records for girls in both the 100 and 200 meter runs that person was you guessed it twist ending a biological boy Terry Miller a transgender won the events in the 100-meter dash the runner up was Andreea Yearwood who's also a boy Yearwood won the class ends print titles last year so you may remember hearing about this guy last year and Miller competed not now listen so your your wood was on the girl was competing against the girls last year Miller who broke the record he competed on the boys team during the winter indoor season and then joined the girls for outdoor so he was a boy three months ago he was a boy just a few months ago he was a boy and now he decided that he's a girl what happened that caused this revelation where he suddenly realized oh you know what um yeah I think I'm a girl you know I thought I think that's actually what's happening here I'm a girl yeah okay what happened like that caused this revelation on his part well I I think I might have an answer to that but we'll get to in a second so Carissa neehoff who's the CIA C executive she was asked about you know what about all the girls who were deprived of a chance to compete because they were knocked out by these two boys as Chrissa says we do feel for them we fully agree it doesn't feel good the optic isn't good but we really do have to look at the bigger issues that speak to civil rights the fact that this is high school sports Hill House coach Jerry Moore said said that's the situation wasn't fair to the girls although he thinks that Miller the boys should have been able to compete so this is this is the kind of moral courage that we're dealing with here is he says yeah it's not fair to the girls but but yeah I'm a of course the boys should be able to compete yeah I mean I'm not saying yeah I'm just pointing out that it's not I mean don't look don't get mad at me don't hit me please don't hit me don't hit me no no yes yes it's okay this is okay I'm just saying that maybe it's a little bit unfair I don't know don't yell at me okay fine it's fair it's actually fair nevermind forget I said anything and then it goes on from there with some quoting some other some other other people as well now this guy by the way Miller he won the 100-meter and he set a record with a time of 11 72 which is a which is a good time for girls but he's not a girl just for comparison's sake and so that you understand in the state outdoor track and field championships for boys his 1172 would not have even placed okay so if you're wondering why this guy Miller decided after competing against the boys and the indoor competition why he decided that all of a sudden he's a girl now well III think this might have something to do it he broke a record against the girls if he'd raced against the men if he'd racing in cement he would have come in 20th place so it's its first place record breaker on one hand or 20th place non-qualifying on the other he chose the latter I wonder why now this is obviously madness I mean this is total madness and to think that we treat the use of steroids as some kind of unforgivable sin in sports yet we allow men with their testosterone and their muscular you know and and their advantages with their muscular structure skeletal structure and so on we allowed them to compete against girls I mean it's it's just crazy it's it's unfair to have people using steroids and competing but that is quite a bit more fair than to have boys competing against girls at least if you're competing if you're a girl competing against another girl on steroids I mean you could use steroids too I guess so that that possibility is open to you although I don't recommend it but if you're competing against boys there's nothing you can do you can't even cheat to beat him it's just he's gonna beat you there's nothing you can do especially when it comes to something like track and field when it comes to something like racing because there's nothing else involved in racing other than just who's stronger and faster that's all that matters there's no extra bit of athleticism and it by the way I ran track in high school so I say this with all due respect to the track and field this is one of the things I liked about track and field is that it's just it's what I liked about running what I still like about running is that it's just so kind of direct it's a very kind of raw and direct sport where I can I get there faster than you that's all so if you're a girl competing against a boy you just you've got no chance he's got he he's coming with physical equipment that you just don't have and so it's wrong and it's unfair but here's the thing I can't really explain why biological boys shouldn't compete against girls I can't really explain why it's wrong to steal these championships from girls who've been working so hard for them I can't really explain it it's it's not self-evident to you then there's not much I can do or say see the left with its with with this gender identity nonsense the left has come up with a position that is so wrong and so irrational that in a weird way it's impenetrable it is a bulletproof argument because it's so wrong and so crazy that there's nothing you can say to it it's a position that can't be defeated because it's already detached from reality and so anything that you any argument that you make is going to be based in reality so you're making arguments that are grounded in reality and they're floating out there in the ether in fantasy world well what can you can't there's nothing what are you gonna do so so I can make my point that biological boys should race against girls and then you can say well why not and I can say because they're boys that's why and if that's not enough for you well I got nothing I got nothing else that's it I just you shouldn't do that we we shouldn't do that because it's it's there boy that's a boy that's a girl they shouldn't race against each other is that is that not clear enough for you you do you need more than that that that is the end of the argument because that's the whole reason and if you won't accept that then there's nothing more to be said you see traditionally there's a reason you may be wondering why arguments and debates in our society are so fruitless and nobody ever wins an argument no debate ever goes anywhere and it's because I think we've we lot we've lost sight of the point of an argument and a point of a debate and there are people who say well you can never win an argument you know arguments can never be won well they can be won the problem arises when one of the people involved in the argument won't acknowledge the fact that the argument has been won so traditionally you win an argument by forcing your opponent to either abandon his position or by backing him into a corner where he has to work where he has to defend some kind of irrational indefensible proposition in order to maintain his position that's another way to women are and once that happens in the argument the argument is over you won even if it continues you've still won it's it's over so let's walk through the process when I say boys shouldn't race against girls and you say yes they should and I say no they shouldn't because boys are biologically different from girls and you say either no they aren't different or the differences don't matter well at that point I've won with your last statement there you have just said something irrational and indefensible and wrong and so I've won checkmate in two moves that's all that's the end there's nothing more that can be said you just claimed either that boys and girls are the same or that their differences aren't relevant to something like track and field and either of those positions are completely lacking in anything resembling reason coherence logic or scientific accuracy and so therefore the argument is over now I'm emphasizing this point for a reason because it's important for us to understand that that there is no way for us to win the argument after it's already been won and the people been defeated just simply refused to acknowledge that they've been defeated because at that point it's not really an argument anymore and when it comes to something like transgenderism particularly the issue of should boys be allowed in the girls restroom should boys be allowed to race against girls and so on the people who believe in this stuff they believe in it based on a religious faith it is a superstition for them they have not reasoned their way to this position so you can't reason them out of it either they haven't looked at the physical evidence and said to themself well yes I mean logically clearly a boy is just like a girl then there's no difference and so they should race against each other no that's not the process that's happened they have just accepted this as a matter of faith as a matter of ideology you know it might also be kind of an ideological expediency because they you know they realized that by supporting this transgender stuff they ideologically it benefits them in some way but either way this is not logical for them and so for those of us who oppose this and who recognize that it's just wrong and baseless well the main thing we can do and should do is simply put our foot down and resist it give it no room cede nothing to it at all that's what we need to do we've already won the argument it's an easy argument to win it's just scientifically these are different types of people boy girl they're not the same okay that's it argument is one right there of high of wanting so that that that's that part of the of the program is over the argument part is over it's one okay they still won't accept it because they have this this is a religious faith superstition for okay so now our next move just whatever they try to do next resist it oppose it do not allow it period that's what we have to do what does that mean in the case of boys racing against girls it means that the parents of the girls the girls who are the victims here the parents need to band together not to make arguments not to sign petitions not know they need to band together and refuse to participate in this kind of thing they need to say no this isn't gonna happen we will not accept this we're gonna pull our our daughters out of track out of the meets until this boy is kicked out they are so you know what you want to have a boy race we're gonna pull our girls out let them run around the track by himself okay let him do that let's let this track meet just devolve into total and coherence because we are not going to participate why isn't that happening where this one I always think in these situations where are the parents what are you doing why are you why are you having your daughter participate in this theater why are you having her humiliate herself by by racing against this boy that she clearly cannot beat four through no fault of her own and so now she has to go through the the humiliation of losing to someone who's cheating these boys are openly cheating you know it would be like if it was if you're if you're racing in a you know your daughters are lining up for a for a race and then a girl rolls up on a on a motorcycle and the people in charge of the race say yeah well we're gonna let her have a motorcy no one else can have one but she can have one well would you tell your daughter to go ahead and race anyway if Chris not that's not even a race anymore this is why I don't know what this is but it's not I know I'm not gonna participate in this that's what every parent should say every parent should absolutely refuse to have their daughters enrolled in these sports so long as this charade is going on and if that were to happen then the schools would be forced to make a choice they'd have to choose between effectively abolishing girls sports or kicking the boys out that's the choice they can make the parents the choice of the parents are giving the school is give us back our girls sports with just girls or we will not enroll our girls in this monstrosity that you have created this I don't even know it can't even call it girls sports anymore this this theater this charade we're not gonna roll our girls net and so we will blame you rightly so for depriving us of girls sports so you can appease the one or two confused boys in the school and honestly I'm not even sure that they are confused I think especially this guy who raced against the boys a couple months ago and is now a girl I simply don't believe that he's even confused about who he is I don't believe it I think he's just plain old cheating and we need to be able to call it what it is because that's what a lot of this stuff is now III fully believe that there's a certain number of so-called transgenders who are legitimately mentally ill which isn't to say that they're legitimately you know the transgenderism itself is not a legitimate phenomenon scientifically or medically but they obviously have some issues and so we should be compassionate to them and and I have a lot of pity for them and I pray for them but we still should not cede to their demands and we should not participate in their delusions or enforce them that's the worst thing we could do for them but that's one category okay I think these days especially you also have another category of people who are quote transgender especially when it comes to these boys that are competing us girls what I just I don't believe that they're even confused I think that they're just cheated they're just pretending plain and simple and so for them I have quite a bit less pity so anyway the schools can choose between appeasing these confused boys and these cheating boys they can appease them and thus alienate every girl and every parent in the school or they can do the opposite that's the choice that the schools have to be given like who are you going to alienate these one or two boys who want to cheat or you can alienate every girl in the school and actually it's not even alienating to tell a boy that he can't compete against girls you're not alienating him to be alienated is to be is to be excluded from some group that you ought to be a part of that's what it means to be alienate it to be alienated is to be deprived of something of your rightful place in a you know somewhere so boys who are told that they can't compete against girls or who are told they can't go in the girls restroom what have you they are not being alienated they're being the opposite of alienated they're being told no we're going to include you where you belong which is with the boys it's the girls who are being alienated when you allow boys to compete against them because they are being deprived of having that exclusive girls competition which is what they should have so they're the ones being alienated the only way that this you know this gender identity transgenderism all the stuff the only way that this stuff has been able to proliferate is because people who know better people who are rational people who are in the majority have been silent and compliant and obedient and I've just let it happen and so we've got to stop letting it happen and I just think this issue with the sports is a perfect example these parents like all you need to have is a little bit of courage just a little bit just a little tiny symbol full of courage that's all we need in our society right now there's a lot of there are a lot of lies that we all know are lies and yet have been able to to grab hold of our culture because we most of us we don't possess even the smallest little smidgen of courage to stand up and say anything about it that's really the great crisis in American society is cowardice we're just a nation of absolute cowards who will just won't say anything will it refuse to make any kind of stand whatsoever if we all had just the smallest tiniest little bit of courage then things would change overnight and that's all that's required to stand up against this transgenderism stuff it's just especially in this context of sports and so on it just requires the smallest amount of courage because with everybody if you stand up and say something almost everybody is going to agree with you now they may agree silently in their heads because they're cowards but they will agree with you you're only going to have to deal with a backlash from a small smattering of LGBT extremists and who cares what they say cares what they think cares so a little bit of courage is all that's needed in these times let's try that on for size and see what a what a difference it makes thanks for watching everybody thanks for listening Godspeed
