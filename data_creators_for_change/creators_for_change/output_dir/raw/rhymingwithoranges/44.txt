very short attention to that so in order

12
00:00:22,289 --> 00:00:24,630

13
00:00:24,630 --> 00:00:27,990
friends along to do challenges at me so

14
00:00:27,990 --> 00:00:29,519

16
00:00:31,590 --> 00:00:34,320
in terms of how you can register to vote

17
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:37,260

18
00:00:37,260 --> 00:00:39,660
that sound good excellent shall we begin

19
00:00:39,660 --> 00:00:44,129

time to fucking battle so<font color="#E5E5E5"> basically all</font>

27
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:06,990
of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the main reasons</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that you should</font>

28
00:01:06,990 --> 00:01:09,450
register to vote now because last year

29
00:01:09,450 --> 00:01:13,439
the government changed the way that

30
00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:16,080
people register to vote so essentially

31
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:18,780
that means that about million people

32
00:01:18,780 --> 00:01:21,299
have fallen<font color="#E5E5E5"> off the register and it</font>

33
00:01:21,299 --> 00:01:25,619
could<font color="#CCCCCC"> be you you need</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to make</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it bigger</font>

34
00:01:25,619 --> 00:01:28,140
than<font color="#CCCCCC"> that they can pick them out I can't</font>

00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:29,320
make your<font color="#E5E5E5"> mouth</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> finger</font>

36
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:30,940
nothing<font color="#E5E5E5"> can be an amazing figure</font>

37
00:01:30,940 --> 00:01:33,520

39
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:38,470
