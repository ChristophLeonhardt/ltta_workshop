the people who don't like the police are the criminals now sure some cops are heavy-handed but I worked in a very busy area we didn't have time to treat before I would never treat anybody unfairly or poorly I took my job seriously as did most of the cops I worked with because we knew who the bad people were and the good people were those guys who might have looked like the bad guys we got to know very quickly they weren't bad guys we didn't arrest them for no reason in fact a lot of these guys were actually good guys funny story we one of the guys became friendly with he would come by the precinct the drink with us afterward he'd meet us out of bars he wound up throwing in the military deployed to Iraq came back safely or attend a great career I'd probably he did his 20 years in the military you know you get to know the people in the neighborhood and become friendly with him doesn't matter what they wear how they dressed they look like how they speak you get to learn who the good guys are who the bad guys and this is so nonsensical because what this does is it creates the message that cops are heavy-handed with everybody and shame on on chief Monahan because he always had a very good reputation it's very very disappointing that he's towing this politically correct line especially at a time when the NYPD and other large agencies are softening the quality of their hires they're not bringing on street cops with the ability to be hard it was a hard job we were dealing with bad people you need a certain toughness to you you need a certain edge to you you need it you can't go in thinking you're a social worker you're not you're there to protect the innocent from the worst in society you're the only wall they've got especially in a city like New York where they can't be armed this is really disappointing and it and it it scares me because I feel like coddling bad guys is really the ultimate goal here because of chief Monahan been around a long time and he knows he knows that cops do their job right day in and day out he knows they respect the public he knows they understand the difference in good people and bad people enforcing this down their throats is demoralizing but even worse it's sending a message to criminals that cops are gonna get that much softer and like I always say the worst thing for society is to put political correctness ahead of Public Safety I want to keep bringing you this content every day so help me do it subscribe to our premium service at www.andyjenkins.com
