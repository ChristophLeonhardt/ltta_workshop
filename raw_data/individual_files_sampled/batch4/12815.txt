it's a new month and that means it's time for a visit to our favorite website everyday feminism now at this point I usually make some cheap stupid joke comparing our monthly visit to the website with a woman's menstrual cycle implying that reading everyday feminism is sort of like experiencing cramps and discomfort uncontrollable mood swings bordering on insanity that leave you feeling as if you're always angry at everyone all the time but today I'm going to refrain from degrading myself by stooping to that sort of low humor because I trust my audience is able to do that on their own so let's just get right to a post on everyday feminism called the differences between the terms gay and queer and why it matters and folks just to show you why I love this website so much I'm going to read the beginning of this article word-for-word so help me the author Harry's Ayad writes quote for for a while I thought I was gay and maybe I was for some of that time there's nothing wrong with being gay but I'm definitely not now I thought I was gay because I thought I was a man and I thought I was only and always attracted to other men I don't know what gender I am anymore if any I knew before coming to that particular realization that I'm also not only and haven't always been attracted to men additionally I realized I don't know what exactly attraction means word for word I swear the author continues quote I know for certain I'm not heterosexual without a stable gender I'm not even sure I could be and when I first began to have these self revelations I also like its space to explore all of these complications as I spend time figuring out what they meant I discovered that if I must have an identification that makes sense to others who need to see me with some sort of stability it would be queer unquote now I know what you're wondering does this tie have a job or does he just sit around with his head this card Vance and I can figure out what sexy is all day I mean come on is not rocket scientist science if you're watching baseball on TV and holding the remote you're probably a man and you're a woman would you please bring me another beer and some chips how tough is this hari's I had concludes quote gayness and queerness are two different things but sometimes gayness is a part of queerness and vice-versa so be queer be gay be both be neither but be you unquote actually I'm not sure bu is such great advice for this guy maybe you should try be someone who does something useful with your life or be someone who keeps your personal problems to yourself or just be quiet oh by the way I noticed that everyday feminism is struggling financially and asking for contributions I almost feel I should send the money by way of thanks for all the comedy after all I couldn't make this stuff up trigger warning I'm Andrew Clavin and this is the Andrew Clavin show showing me off the signal tsunami blows if it isn't it's someone haha I bet this night makes me feel guilty at this point like reading the stuff off the website I'm a guy I is it right to make fun of that guy yes I guess it is I mean it's just reading it out loud alright it smelled like day well

is this is a genuinely creepy story ok it may be it's like a week and a half ago I mean my wife is making dinner she's in the kitchen making dinner and I'm sitting at the kitchen table keeping her company drinking a glass of wine right and we're chatting and we get into one of those dopey you know meaningless conversations you have when you're just talking about I think we started talking about some super rich guy like B Zoe's from Amazon or something he was less rich than gates for a minute and then Gates was Richard and I I said you know the only thing is there's nothing I want that I could get by being super rich there's nothing I really want to buy except one thing I would like to have a private jet because flying commercial airlines is now such a pain and then that you know the and I said you know I wouldn't even have to be rich enough to get my own private jet I'd be happy to join one of those consortiums or one of those businesses where everybody chips in and has a jet you scheduled at at different times a day or two later I go online and there's an ad for a company that has private jets and do you know about this so so I'm like naive enough where I'm thinking this has got to be a coincidence because like I said it was one of those dopey conversations was not something I ever wrote anybody about or mused about online or blogged about or talked about on the show there's just things kind of popped into my head as we're talking and I'm thinking this has got to be a coincidence and shows up on all my devices ads for like you know private jet companies that you can so today I wake up and on insta pundit when Reynolds great blog it has an article that in fact if you have a specifically Facebook Messenger app this Facebook Messenger app which I don't use because I do that all that on my computer but if you have it on your phone it it's set to have a microphone on and they are listening I'm sitting in my kitchen with my wife talking and it is listening to me and then deciding what ads to send first I delete it the thing like as I'm leading that app but then you can go on the settings privacy settings and press microphone and turn off the microphone on all your because you don't need a microphone on most of these apps the one the only one I could think of that I would use is that when you sing to it and tells you what song it is you know that that I guess needs a microphone but jeepers that to me was a bridge too far cuz I didn't even like that when they were doing it in my email like I remember sending an email to somebody and saying whoa what am i doing I'm shopping for an elliptical machine six months like after I bought the machine they're still sending me these ads for the elliptical machine let's stop reading my email you know but at least I feel like when I'm online I just I just figure there is no no no it's creepy you know I just figure when I'm online you know replaying the nude scenes from Game of Thrones whatever the hell I'm doing if you're people people are watching that stuff the NSA I just figure I understand that I've sacrificed my privacy but in my kitchen when I'm not online just talking and then my phone is listening to me enough enough that was that was a privacy violation too far all right so I thought I'd share that you can go on on your settings just hit the privacy button go on microphone and turn it off and the specific one they mentioned was Facebook I found a bunch of them that had like I go ghoul Maps doesn't need a microphone from me I type things into it I don't talk to it do you talk to your math program yeah and so like turn that off and man it's like Oh anyway okay there they are listening to I suppose this is going to be a generation that just won't care but I ain't it I am not the one so you know I've now begun to feel that the news is just making us stupid now part of that is the summer not that much goes on it's been an interesting summer because of all the chaos at the White House of firing people and all this stuff but yesterday they have this quote scandal unquote that Donald Trump juniors first note about his meeting with the Russian babe who was telling him about the you know magnesia act and it never amounted to anything and this is now Trump said he had nothing to do with this but maybe he dictated the note and all this and Sarah Huckabee Sanders the spokeswoman for the White House says no he just kind of shipped in this as any dad would but I like the response not the first cut of Sarah Sanders but the second cut where she just basically said like please enough is enough here it is everybody wants to try to make this some story about misleading the only thing I've seen misleading is the years worth of stories that have been fueling a false narrative about this Russia collusion and based on phony scandal based on anonymous sources and I think that is if we're going to talk about misleading that's the only thing misleading I see in this entire process I was well you guys are focused on a meeting that Don junior had no consequence when the Democrats actually colluded with a foreign government like Ukraine the Democrat linked firm fusion GPS actually took money from the Russian government while it created the phony dossier that's been the basis for all of the Russia scandal fake news and if you want to talk further about a relationship with Russia look no further than the Clintons as we've said time and time again Bill Clinton was paid half a million dollars to give a speech to a Russian bank and was personally thanked by Putin for it Hillary Clinton allowed one-fifth of America's uranium to reserve to be sold to a Russian firm whose investors were Clinton foundation donors and the Clinton campaign Chairman's brother lobbied against sanctions on Russia's largest bank and failed to report it so so the reason this is okay with me because it's what about ISM you know I did this but what about it's because there's no still no story and I know I talked about when Robert Muller was made the Special Counsel in investigating this stuff I talked about what a big mistake I thought that was ridiculous I thought it was I've been sort of proved right already in that he's hiring all these Democrats he's obviously going to go off the reservation maybe he looks at something like this and says evidence of a guilty conscience that they lied about it but the story itself isn't there I mean all these things if you think of every look during the campaign people do all kinds of nefarious stuff they all of them they all do nefarious stuff I'm sure the Trump camp was meeting with people they should have met with I'm sure the Hillary camp was meeting with people it ain't beanbag it's politics or they're always doing this nefarious talk but think of each thing is kind of a dot the line that is connecting the dots here is the narrative and the narrative is that Russia hacked our elections and Donald Trump kept he helped them Donald Trump helped them mess up our elections but we know that they have no effect on our elections we know that they do this all the time and we do it back to them we know this is always happening and we know the Trump was not I mean we fairly reasonably certain the Trump was not sitting around going yes yes help me you know mess up the voting booths or whatever I mean the word collusion isn't even a legal word that they keep using so we and we know that the Clinton camp was so deep with the Russians through fusion GPS that investigates that freelance investigatory firm we know on so the narrative itself doesn't exist so they're getting narrative points on the storyline for a story that isn't there and it's just it's wearying at this point and 6% of the country say this is an important story seventy-five percent of the coverage or something like that goes to this story six percent of the people care about it why should they care about it why should they care if Skara Anthony scaramouche II has a job or not well you know it's it's a what is its staff change you know it's dramatic I get that it's news I get that it's like fun to watch and all this stuff and that Trump's weird outlandish style is fun and all but who cares I mean look you know you have a life I have a life these are the things that matter I can't I care when the next D'Souza gets sent to jail for making a movie about Barack Obama that makes me scared because you know he he did commit some minor you know now seasons with campaign funding laws which are already stupid laws to begin with some minor thing nobody else would have anybody else would have been fine slap on the wrist they were to wag the finger at him you know he was facing serious jail time because Barack Obama doesn't like people making movies about him that insult them you know the Hillary Clinton was trying to shut down citizens united trying to reverse that that just says you have the right to make movies about her vibrant because they made him citizens united made a movie attacking her she didn't like the fact that we had the First Amendment that stuff bothers me this scaramouche is that they you know I get that it's a minor flash-in-the-pan news story and it's funny and all that but really they're making us stupid and they're doing it on purpose all right we got to say goodbye to Facebook and YouTube which means you will be cast from the free video into the exterior darkness where there is great weeping and gnashing of teeth but if you come over to the Daily wire calm you can listen to the rest of the show or subscribe for a lousy ten bucks a month or a hundred bucks for an entire year like okay a hundred by and for a hundred bucks for the entire year you get the leftist tears mug plus you can be in the mail bag and you know you can ask anything we've got some very poignant questions in the mailbag and you can ask anything you want our answers are guaranteed 100 percent correct and will change your life possibly for the better and if you want to send them in live you can send them in live and we will catch them come on over to the daily wire.com so the thing the thing about this fall the panic and the you know always chaos and everybody is it does affect Washington DC and you'll notice that there are more and more stories about the Republicans going off the reservation they're going to ignore Trump you know they ignored for instance that transgender penalty tweeted about the military was like you know and make that an order and well you know you're the commander in chief but if it's a tweet we in my book it doesn't say tweet we have today you know it's kind of just disappeared they're still studying the issue I'm sure they'll come up with a result in like six months and do whatever they do about it and now the at times new york times which is used to be a newspaper i think they have a story congressional republicans moved on tuesday to defuse president Trump's threat to cut off critical payments to health insurance companies maneuvering around the president toward bipartisan legislation to shore up insurance markets under the Affordable Care Act so enough course senator Lamar Alexander of Tennessee the influential chairman of the Senate health education labor and pensions committee announced that his panel would begin work in early September on legislation to stabilize and strengthen the individual health insurance market for 2018 so in other words they're going to prop Obamacare up which is I mean if you want to lose the Republican majority that's it that that would happen like the next day I think they think they would hold like an election those elections that they have would like torches and pitchforks where they says come and toss you out you know and have you seen a few since calf Lake Senator Jeff like he wrote this book called the conscience of a conservative obviously a very very famous book by senator Barry Goldwater has become and it's become a sort of you know conservative guidebook basically so he writes he I'll tell you why this is funny in a minute he writes this book basically Ramin Trump and saying we've got to get back that and now here he is on Face the Nation and it's suddenly his term changes was the book I haven't read the book but I've just read a couple of excerpts it really goes after Trump calling him a demagogue and all this stuff and now he goes on Face the Nation suddenly butter wouldn't melt on in his mouth well I felt that just like Goldwater had felt in his time 56 years ago when he wrote the original conscience of a conservative that the party had lost sway and I think similarly today the party is lost its way we've given into nativism and protectionism and I think that if we're going to be a governing party in the future in a majority party we've got to go back to traditional conservatism limited government economic freedom individual responsibility respect for free trade those are the principles that made us who we are so she's looking he's got this kind of sincere look and all this stuff and he goes on Chris Matthews on MSNBC and Matthews is saying wait a minute where's the Trump attacks so you know in your book it's all Trump attacks where is it listen to this what's getting this book a lot of publicity and a lot of attention the reason I I stay with is how tough you are on Donald Trump not that sort of generalized critique you're offering about the world conditions are giving me here you have a different tone right now in this room well having this book this book is very hard-hitting very hard-hitting on Trump demagoguery is the word you use populism protectionism used to all the tough words and you don't like them you don't think there's presidents good for the country do well let me say well no in this book it says he's not talking I'll talk about what I talk about in the book okay good III say in the book that I've agreed with him on many things you know Supreme Court justice great one great you know cabinet picks worked with him on regulatory reform and where I think that he's profoundly unconservative is on things like free trade I mean that's something that we can't abandon as Republicans we are decidedly less conservative if we do so I think it's a tough well written book and I just wanted to keep you to it it wears my face you already liver with the hate here's the thing about this guy okay about Jeff Flake Brent Bozell who is a Chum and who runs the fantastic media Research Center website that I'm quoting all the time and we take some of their videos I don't always remember to credit them but they are a terrific one of my favorite websites truly because they just go after bias in the press and I just every time they catch him out line it's really it's a funny website but it's also just really useful useful website Brent Bozell father ghostwrote Goldwater's book okay so he ghostwrote it he Bozell puts out a statement he says on behalf of my late father and my family I am denouncing Senator Jeff Flake and his new book dishonestly titled conscience of a conservative since entering the Senate in 2013 Jeff Flake has time and again proven he is part of the indulgent hypocrisy in Washington while he waxes poetically about conservative principles his conservative review Liberty score is an abysmal 53% also known as F in 2013 I watched firsthand as flake refused to sign a letter pledging to defund Obamacare among his many betrayals to conservatism Jeff Flake is neither a conservative nor does he have a conscience I mean ouch and listen you know a 53% rating from a from the lib from the lib conservative Liberty score that stinks that stinks and he's and he goes out there and he might he talks about Mike Pence who's a genuine conservative I came in the same time as Mike Pence we thought you know it's so funny but this is what this is the thing the left loves I'd love to take these guys and say oh look it's bipartisan it's bipartisan everybody hates Trump Trump needs to do exactly one thing he needs to do one thing he needs to get rid of the rule that allows Congress not to be part of Obamacare as people people don't know this you know in Congress you don't have to be in Obamacare and the reason is Chuck Grassley you're a Republican good Republican passed a amendment to the Affordable Care Act that that made it so they did have to do it and Obama passed a rule he didn't go through he went to the Office of Personnel Management make a rule that says basically the House and the Senate are small businesses right because you have fewer than 50 full-time employees as note and it's a small business and so that way they can get out of they use that to get out of being on Obamacare I mean people don't know this stuff all Trump has to do is pull that rule that's not a law it's not part of the law because Obama knew if he tried to amend the law he'd have to give stuff to the Republicans and he never wanted to do stuff to the Republicans all you have to do is put them on Obama care and like the next day it'll be repealed I mean they do not want to do this and and this is you know this is in the Federalist Papers one of the Federalist Papers says you want to know when tyranny is coming it's when the people who make the laws don't obey the laws and you know Trump it is also I just want to say just want to remind you the Trump is doing good things the New York Times today I think Knowles is going to be talking about this on his show they had a report the Jeff Sessions may go after affirmative action of course in the New York Times they're horrified oh my god you know they're going to go after people for discriminating against a white people but affirmative action is really bad it's bad for black people it's bad for everybody it takes away takes away your dignity it takes away your accomplishments you know because people don't think oh yeah you have a medical agreement did you get it through affirmative action it also puts people in colleges where they can't succeed I mean even the Malcom Gladwell it talks about this that you know you put guys into college where you can't succeed it's actually worse for them than putting them somewhere where they can excel so that's a good thing the top and buyer one of the top environmental protection agency officials resigned because she's like with the EPA the EPA is going and she says this is all lies you know it's lies the truth is there is no war on coal there is no economic crisis caused by environmental protection climate change is caused by man's active activities I mean there is a war on coal Hillary Clinton said they were going and and Barack Obama said they were going to drive call out of business and yeah does mankind's activities contribute to the change of the climate almost certainly do we know how much no and while the press by the way and I'm going to get to the mailbag in a minute but while the press is navel-gazing on all this inside Washington stuff Venezuela is going up in flames through as the at in the endgame of socialism it is the endgame of socialism and do not forget Sean Penn Noam Chomsky Oliver Stone you know big names on the left supported this guy Michael Moore a congressman Jose Serrano from New York these guys really supported Hugo Chavez and this is on them and this is land now it's not only that it's it's leftist policy I think the thing that he was doing then ago shabbos was doing was leftist policy I mean I you know I don't want to stick it even to Obama to I mean I love to give it to Obama when I can but he congratulated the Venezuelan people when they reelected Hugo Chavez he did say a couple of times that this was not a good thing but he also supported you know Obama supported socialism when he was praising Bernie Sanders he said Bernie Sanders may be going too fast but you know this is basically a good thing and this is what who the left is you know there was a piece by Barry Weiss in the New York Times talking about the fact that leader finally in the New York Times and this Barry Weiss used to work for The Wall Street Journal so maybe that's why he's paying attention finally talking about the fact that the leaders of the feminist movement linda's are sure and and Carmen Perez and Tameka Mallory these people are terrible terrible people I mean Linda saucier you know is for Sharia law she's big Sharia law supporter I they all support this cop killer what's-her-name Assata Shakur who's a cop killer who's escaped into Cuba they support his name is just going out of my head for rockin for rocking the anti-semite black Muslim leader Farrakhan there it is Farrakhan you know these are terrible terrible people on the left so while the while the press is bobbling around about who wrote Donald Trump Jr's note you know while they're talking about this and what's happening to anthony scaramouche II the left you they are salting you know the stuff that makes the world work that makes the world better they're really doing it terrible well well Trump is actually doing good stuff I really like that Roger Kimball came on and talked about that yesterday because now you know the smart people are saying it too not just me it's actual people with it an education all right the mailbag that's just a second of dead air before you gather from Eric this is a very pointing question dear mr. Clavin is there an appropriate time to not honor your father I have recently moved back home with my parents now that I'm done with college and waiting to ship out to the Navy in my time away at school my dad's casual drinking has turned into a nightly routine of getting so drunk he can't talk despite the fact I have asked him to cut down his drinking on numerous occasions he continues his habits to the point that he is no longer his old self is there a point where he no longer deserves my respect well first of all Eric thank you for your service joining the Navy and I'm really sorry this is happening alcohol is obviously all these addictions they call them a disease they're not a disease you know you can't you can't give up cancer you know when you have a disease you know it's not the same thing but they are they are instruments of the enemy of mankind there's just no question about it when you see the end result as I have seen many times too many times because I'm a writer and an artist and a lot of people have known throughout my life of abused drugs and alcohol when you see the end result of this you know that basically if this stuff takes your soul away if you follow it down the road let me answer your question about honoring your father because it's something I know about I didn't get along with my dad he was a he could be a toxic personality with his kids I always felt certainly he was with NAT shouldn't speak for anybody else in my family but certainly he was a toxic influence on me so I do know about this that first theologically I am someone who believes that Jesus takes us beyond the laws of the Old Testament he himself refused to see his mother and his brothers when they came to take him away because they thought he might be out of his mind since he was going around making all these claims about himself and performing miracles and like when his mother and brothers and sisters came to get him he said my mother and my brothers my sisters my family are those who obey God who those who love God and basically rejected them there so he goes beyond the law but but the law to honor your father and your mother is written on the heart as well I mean as something that is not just written on the stone of the Ten Commandments it's also written on the heart here's the thing when you honor your father you're not honoring the man you're honoring his fatherhood you're honoring the fact like I said I didn't get along with my father but my father did feed me he did put a roof over my head he did create me and I always tried to be civil to him when I could I stayed away from him I never told him what I was going on in my life because his advice was always toxic and destructive when he was sick I went and visited him I was at his death bed when he died I did not walk up turn my back on him and walk away forever but even that sometimes is necessary I mean I know women who have been abused by their fathers more than one and I really do feel that at that point this guy is such it has done such a bad thing that he has forfeited his role as father and to honor his creation which is you to honor his creation as a father you have to walk away you have to walk away from him just just because the thing that he did as a father is you preserve that you you have to walk away so I would say in this situation where the guy is drinking too much and he won't listen and maybe he's depressed maybe you know he's got the he's got the you know an empty nest depression or something like this but whatever he's doing it's a bad thing you have to protect yourself first you are the creation of your father you are the prime his prime achievement as a father and to honor him you must protect yourself first and and keep not let him destroy you I would not you know punch him out I would not cut him out of your life if you can possibly keep him there I would honor him his fatherhood to that degree but protect yourself because you are his great you are his great creation as a father and to honor him you have to honor yourself so that is my answer of that from Jacob hello incomparable matchless unequal unsurpassed and top-shelf clayvin as yet that's that's what's on my actual desk my question to you is whether the denial of Peter destroys the concept of free will for Peter was told that he would what he would do and and when and still could not change the outcome I've spoken about this before I don't believe that God sees time the same way we do I think he sees it all at once and so we who live in time and cannot live outside of time do have free will but he sees everything that's going to happen I don't actually believe that Jesus while he was on earth I think he was living in time but he partook of the knowledge of the father's have knew some things that were going to happen but yes Peter did have free will it's just that God's view of time and our view of time is different so you just can't compare you can't think in terms of God dear energy with the daily wire had at a staff boxing tournament who would win Jeremy he's the boss right yeah hahaha you left the boss win as an easy question supreme galactic ruler Darth clay Venus I've been a Christian for pretty much my whole life and I've been living under the assumption that 2 Corinthians 6:14 is marital advice that says don't yoke yourself to an unbeliever I think which it's not actually about marriage but it's but he says having studied the Bible I've only just realized that this verse was not written for the context of marriage do you think it is still good to not marry outside the faith or have I been wrongly limiting my marriage prospects this whole time thanks your humble servant Sawyer okay so this is not a theological question there is nothing that I have ever seen in the in what Jesus says that would prevent you that says God doesn't want you to marry outside the faith there is nothing that I can find that Jesus says that does that so it's not a theological question it's a values question it is a question of you know you're going to be living with someone for a very long time you're going to be producing children you're going to want to agree about the education of the children and what the children's values are going to be you have to really look ahead I really think ahead no matter how much how attracted you might be to someone or how much it feels like love's sweet song you really have to look at and be practical about this at some level and say look you know if this is a woman who believes in abortion say that's correct be a problem then when we're teaching our children right from wrong if this is a person who is hostile toward God if this is a person who will never ever find faith and will always mock faith and make fun of faith that's going to be a problem when you when you have kids too if you bring your kid to church and he wants to know why you know mommy doesn't come and mommy is not going to be pleasant about that or kind and is going to destroy your child's chance of faith those are all real serious problems so all I would say is marriage can be tough marriage is a long haul it's a it's a marathon and and you want to be in as close and connected and in sync with your partner as you possibly can so it's it's just something you want to think about it is one of the things you want to think about but there's nothing that I have ever seen in in the Gospels that forbids it it's not a theological question it's a values question and a wisdom question so I would like be careful so somebody actually did send in a lot when how did you learn Greek I learned it from a book and you know I what was it we mounts we amounts as a workbook gee I'm so proud of myself remembering that I thought here I did it assiduously I only I don't have a lot of time so I did it 20 minutes every day I still now everyday I read four lines of the Gospels in Greek and translate them and and then I do a little vocabulary memorization so I do that every day probably going to push it to five lines but I won't push it past that because it's still very hard I could study more and get better but but right now I think this as far as I want to go I can read the Gospel and that's what I set out to do so William ouncer that did it totally out of a book and he had he has a website where he lets you go on and there were all kinds of tests you could take and occasionally you could look at a video if you pay more you can look at his videos and he'll just do the class and you can do an online class that worked for me so I was I was really happy Andrew Klavan no grandiose title necessary I take issue with that but I'll let it pass in this case I am currently enlisted in the army and I volunteered for Special Forces selection which I will be attending in about a year if I make it through the training and become a green beret I will abandon having a family and getting married for the fear of being an emotional burden on my potential wife and kids in the case of death great injuries psychological damage and being away on deployments for seven months every year especially so if I make a career out of it for 20 years people around me think this is a bad idea what's your take on it Thanks this is from Eric Eric thanks so much for volunteering to serve your country I hope you make it's a tough road to get that Green Beret I know and I have known people who do it and it is it's really tough on families here's what I would say about this you are a hero a hero's not everybody is a hero you are a hero just for trying to do this even you know even if you don't make it I think you will but if you don't you know you're still hero for trying to do this the wives of people who do this are also heroes and heroes are not everyday people I mean this is the thing you know in the our kind of everybody gets a trophy culture there's this idea that we're all were all heroes we're all special or we're not I mean if everybody's special then nobody's special special people are special Green Berets are special people the wives of Grey's are special people everything you bring up here is legit you know the long deployments the possibility of injury possibility of psychological damage your wife is going to have to be a hero I know Green Berets I know seals that's a very tough row to hoe for marriage and your right to be careful you can't marry just any woman you're going to have to marry somebody who is as big a hero as you and that's something you're going to have to look at when you're because I know believe me I know you get wrapped up in in attraction you get wrapped up in love you get wrapped up in romance and it's easy not to think about these things as marriage but a long-term commitment if you're a green beret you are going to have to marry a hero that's my answer I think if you find a hero marry her because you'll be you'll be well suited to one another dear Andrew from Francis this is not a life altering question but I hope you will address it what is your analysis of why while the feminism that arose in the 60s is outraged at the assumption that there might be differences between men and women at the same time our culture has hyper-sexualized women okay I think I understand that question both the feminism did not cause the hyper sexualization of women but both feminism and the hyper standby hyper sexualization I'm taking you to mean the fact that you know women are used to advertise everything from beer to cars and basically it's like if you like how sexy this girl is you know buy the beer if that women are basically you know you walk around LA and you see women dressed basically it's like a they I thought do I put this exactly they're not dressed modestly they're dressed to display themselves sexually in a billboard for warehouse yes yes I have work boots a yes you know I see that all the time it's over one of the gas stations I stopped at I mean they're there it's insane you know it doesn't say both feminism and this trend derive from a materialist view of life one of the things that feminism has done is it has embraced the the materialism of workaday culture in other words it has said that your value is measured in money your value is measured in promotion it used to be that a woman's value as a homemaker as a mother was incalculable you couldn't say what money went into that there's no there's no weight you know that words that a woman does somebody wants a tow if you paid a mother you'd be paying millions of dollars you probably wouldn't you probably wouldn't but it's in comfortable how can you calculate the value of having your mom at home when you come home I mean how can you calculate the value of someone who builds or makes a home for you I mean I wouldn't I wouldn't want to calculate the value of what my wife has done in my life and my children's like you know this it's priceless but both feminism and this culture have embraced a materialist view of what people are and so that view ultimately leads to erotomania ultimately means that sax and reven reproduction just pleasure physical pleasure becomes the purpose of a human being we've been talking a lot about purpose does an article I wanted to talk about today but I can't get to it we've been talking a lot about this lost idea that people have purpose I'll try and get to this article tomorrow because it says the universe has no purpose and that is basically what they've been selling us and both of these things feminism and and hyper sex come from the same well you know I will say this though that the transgenderism is all materialism makes no sense and so materialism always ends up in people saying things that don't make sense but transgenderism is ridiculous because first they save you you're just a body then they say well men and women are exactly the same it's just a difference in body they can do all the same things they have and then they say well I'm a man I'm a woman inside a man's body you think well how would you know if men and women are exactly the same how would you know if you're a woman inside a man's body you'd just be exactly the same you know so you are you just wearing a dress on the inside I mean what is what does that mean you know so it makes no sense the materialism but it leads to both of these things all right I'm going to end up there is there another one that came in live no okay stuff I like we're going to rejigger this show we're going to go beyond stuff I like but we'll do a couple more to end the week and I just noticed I was at the movies watching I can't remember what and they are remaking Murder on the Orient Express which was a wonderful movie based on an Agatha Christie novel really interesting Agatha Christie mystery thing about Agatha Christie is he wrote so many books but you can't pass we guess the killer in any of them because every one of them has a sheets used every possible trick there could be the only clue this ever in her books if she didn't believe that people killed each other over love she only believed they killed each other over money which isn't true but she believes in that that sometimes governs who the killer is really interesting a really fun movie the the old film which had Albert Finney is air-cool Perot and it was basically a cast of stars and this one has Ken Brannigan actually we do we have a little bit of the trailers play the film I see even on this train a passenger has died so I got him after all you asked you more skin no no no not it was in perfectly developed he had his enemies indeed it was mother of course murder he peaceful someone was rummaging around my cabin in the middle of the night no one is listening to me if there was a murder what is going on and there was another the murderer is with us and every one of you is a suspect and who are you my name is acute Powell and I'm probably the greatest detective in the world this can brag teaching the scenery a little bit is a good part Johnny Depp is Anna Penelope Cruz I thought I saw Judi Dench in there in the in the trailer I'm not a big egg of the Christie fan she's a little girly and domestic for me I got to admit but I have read a couple of them that I just loved this is one of them Murder on the Orient Express excellent novel aye it's a toss-up do you want to see the movie and you know get the ending there or do you want to read the book first I haven't read this one if you haven't read it then there were none sometimes called Ten Little Indians that they they had to change the title because it wasn't politically correct they call it and then there were none then there were none is a classic then there were none I have to say as a classic piece of mystery writing that is so good it kind of overwhelms my problems with Agatha Christie I she was a good writer and she was an excellent observer of the years between the wars in England now then there were not as a terrific one the secret of chimneys which is absolutely absurd although I did guess the ending of that when I was proud of myself I guess the onion secret of chimneys but it's really fun the secret of chimneys is really fun and some of these if you ever belonged to audible they make a really good listen their act actually excellent listening but they do make good beat reads Agatha Christie then there were non Murder on the Orient Express Murder on the Orient Express and secret of chimneys tomorrow we have a guest I think it's Christian toto but to talk about movies excellent I love talking to Christian Toto that will be the final show of the week already it's unbelievable and then who knows who's going to get fired at the Trump White House terima this very people just don't last long during the Clavin was weekend I'm Andrew Clavin this is the Andrew Clavin show we'll see you tomorrow
