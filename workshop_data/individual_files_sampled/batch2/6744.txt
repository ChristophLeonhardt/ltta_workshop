Homeland Security Secretary Kristin Nielsen was testifying in front of the Senate Judiciary Committee in regard to accusations against Donald Trump saying that certain countries were so-called shithole countries of course he was talking to about African countries Haiti and El Salvador now during that hearing she testified that she didn't remember that exact word being used and Cory Booker was not pleased with her answer take a look at their exchange now I've been in the Oval Office many times and when the commander and chief speaks I listened I don't have amnesia on conversations I had in the Oval Office going back months and months and months and I've had individual meetings with the president and I've had group conversations where there was as you said crosstalk dick Durbin to Lindsey Graham they seem to have a much better recollection of what went on you're under oath you and others in that room that suddenly cannot remember it was Martin Luther King that said there's nothing in this world more dangerous than sincere ignorant and conscientious stupidity King said a man dies when he refuses to stand up for that which is right a man dies when he refuses to stand up for justice a man dies when he refuses to take us down Elie Wiesel says we must take side neutral it neutrality helps the oppressor Gandhi said silence becomes cowardice cowardice when we occasion when the occasion demands speaking out like Lindsey Graham did and that you could even say in your testimony that Norwegians were were preferenced by him because they're so hard-working excuse me let me finish happy to okay so he was obviously very impassioned during his comments on her testimony and remember she said that she remembers tough language but she doesn't recall exactly what that tough language was and she said that she didn't recall the word shithole being used by Donald Trump so that's the reason why cory booker responded in that way now there's a follow-up to this story and the follow-up is accusations of sexism and mansplaining who is making those accusations it's actually the RNC chair woman her name is Rhonda McDaniel she goes on CNN and hear the case that she's trying to make take a look well Chris I just think it would have been covered differently if it were a Republican senator yelling or lecturing a woman coming before the Senate not giving her a chance to explain herself grandstanding I know he's auditioning for 20/20 I understand that but he was disrespectful and he did mansplain to her and she's an intelligent woman she's the Secretary of Homeland Security and she deserved an opportunity to answer well she was here for a time she was answering she just kept saying the same thing what what okay so she is saying that Cory Booker is mansplaining to her when in reality Cory Booker is talking to her communicating with her in the exact same way that you would expect you know senators or other politicians to communicate with one another when they disagree you see that type of rhetoric being used all the time to say that he was mansplaining is actually in my opinion insulting to women because she is essentially saying there well it's a woman and so you need to treat her differently you need to be softer with her you need to be gentler with her you can't treat her as if she's an adult who can handle you know some criticism or tough talk from another individual so I'm gonna break down what Ronald McDonald said a little bit better or a little bit more there so number one Cory Booker is not talking about women's issues he's talking about denigrating all African countries plus Haiti Plus El Salvador and first of all you don't understand why anybody be upset about that but Cory Booker is also african-american so I think it gets to be upset about that to any degree that he likes now she says he's grandstanding and running for 2020 he's a politician she left it at that I'd say okay you know he did make a political speech I think he gets to be pissed about that and you know we and if you're progressive and you're questioning it you really pissed who cares man he's on the right side of the issue and he's fighting good I want all the Democratic senators to fight so I'll take it okay now on to the to the mansplaining part so don't hide behind sexism when you are not in favor of women's rights when you are taking away reproductive rights from women including a story we did just yesterday okay and you're taking away all sorts of rights for women you don't believe in equal pay you don't believe in any of these things and the minute or a republican woman is criticized on any issue doesn't matter what the issues oh he's mansplaining no no now all of a sudden I care about sexism and I'm claiming that if you can dare criticize a Republican woman that that sexism and it's mansplaining to her Oh get the fuck out of here I'm sorry if you're gonna be offended cuz oh I forgot Ronald McDonald is a Republican woman I'm not allowed to criticize her as a progressive I'm not sure if you got the memo we don't give a shit about those rules you're totally full of shit you're not for women's rights so don't come in here on a completely different issue trying to subvert the topic but and claim the shield of sexism when in reality you guys are not don't give a damn about that issue Cory Booker responded to these accusations I want to give him an opportunity to respond and you an opportunity to take a look at it so let's let's see well first of all I'm glad they're finally attacking me they attack senators almost every single day but it's a little insulting to say that I should be treating cabinet secretaries one way or another depending upon their gender I'm standing here as a United States Senator in my official capacity challenging a cabinet secretary who's lying before the Senate on an issue that affects my state as well as this nation as well as us internationally something as serious as her lying about overt bigotry coming out of the out of the White House okay so I think that's a good that's a good response it is insulting I wouldn't want any guy to speak to me differently than his male colleagues simply because I'm a woman now she did respond to that so let's look at her response why would he have to treat Nielson differently she's so strong she's so competent she's so empowered why would he have to talk to her differently than he would to a man I don't think he should have to talk to her differently but I will say he was disrespectful to her as Secretary of Homeland Security and he was mansplaining to her and I do think there's always a man splaining just because she's a woman if they talk to people like that all the time or honor they talk to men like that all the time as to how Elizabeth Warren is treated versus how secretary Nielsen is treated my president calls her Pocahontas yeah but when Democrats interrupt little Lizabeth Warren the media goes crazy and when it just happened to didn't go crazy it happens almost impossible to interrupt Elizabeth Warren I know I have to jump in because she's make first of all she said Democrats interrupting Elizabeth Warren no no the the drama involving Elizabeth Warren had nothing to do with Democrats interrupting her it was during the confirmation hearings for Jeff Sessions and Elizabeth Warren wanted to bring up some concerns over Jeff Sessions racist past and racist statements and you know what Republicans in the Senate did they literally shut her up they shut her up by using some obscure rule that had never been used before so she wouldn't be able to continue on with that line of questioning they didn't mansplain to her they didn't interrupt her they literally stopped her from her line of questioning okay that's very different that was awesome by chris cuomo so she's like oh can you believe the sexism of cory booker mansplaining to nielsen that's the implication in Orono mcdonald's saying and so when when and she says and how about elizabeth warren and quote was like you ought to have a sex is a Trump calls Warren pocahontas yeah that might be the very worst person you could bring up as an example in this context and you work for Trump you work for Trump who brags about sexual assault being charged for 17 different women saying that he's done these terrible things to them I mean we don't even have to get into all that that cause as a United States Senator Pocahontas and now you're gonna come in here and say I am shocked and chagrined that a Republican woman wouldn't be treated with respect I find out that there's sexism in the world I mean come on you you are supportive of a president who has openly called women pigs who has talked about groping women without their consent who has talked about women's weight and how overweight he thinks certain women are who has gone after women who have accused him of sexual misconduct by discussing their physical appearance you want to talk about sexism take a good hard look at your own political party you just watch the video by The Young Turks home of the revolution if you'd like to get a lot more than that get the full show by
