I bought that for you much well the
house is on fire today we're at fire
station number four in the nets this is
the one that's closest to the airport
part of the city that gets shelled the
most and the firemen here have been
doing triple quadruple the amount of
work that they had to do in peacetime
not only that there's a lot less of them
because many have escaped the city to
other parts of the country artists

that's it essentially we look to the
Neos with the solution three slices so
long my ABC stop radio ha yes mr. Mike
was nibbling astonishing there's just
been an artillery barrage for the last
half hour 40 minutes or so so we're
expecting a call to come in for a fire
at any moment they're just waiting to
get that call then they're going to pile
into the trucks and drive away
meantime they're making an outhouse in
case the city water supply gets cut off
okay the outhouse is installed but now
they can't get the door open
so we've just got to enable them that's
just like next to the airport it's just
beyond those houses here this is where
the thick of it is my heart is pounding
they're about to put this fire out we've
just arrived
reporte
I am working from
yeah well the house is on fire
oh they're about to put it out but
it doesn't look like there's anybody
here so thank God for that
but there's pieces that are coming down
so we better get out of here
well they've almost put the fire out but
we don't want to stay here too long
anyways because near the airport is
where most of the fighting happens most
of the houses on this block have already
been blown up so we're going to stay
here as long as we have to and then head
straight back to the fire station
