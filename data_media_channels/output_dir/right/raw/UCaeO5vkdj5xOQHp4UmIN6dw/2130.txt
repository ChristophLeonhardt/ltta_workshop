unfeminine since feminists have never

75
00:02:33,270 --> 00:02:35,460
might cause some observers<font color="#CCCCCC"> to believe</font>

rights are being eroded by the deep

state by the administrative state but as

99
00:03:48,750 --> 00:03:50,970
it's sometimes called really interesting

100
00:03:50,970 --> 00:03:52,260
piece and we'll talk to<font color="#CCCCCC"> him about it</font>

101
00:03:52,260 --> 00:03:54,660
also we got to talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> about the the health</font>

102

care repeal and replace Obamacare with

103

it but but<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're actually let's step</font>

105
00:04:02,490 --> 00:04:03,930
back about on<font color="#E5E5E5"> this health care thing</font>

106
00:04:03,930 --> 00:04:06,660
okay this this is the<font color="#E5E5E5"> the proposal that</font>

107
00:04:06,660 --> 00:04:08,970
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> GOP has made for how they're going</font>

108
00:04:08,970 --> 00:04:10,530
to repeal Obama care what they're going

109
00:04:10,530 --> 00:04:12,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">to replace a bit and conservatives are a</font>

110
00:04:12,030 --> 00:04:14,670
little<font color="#E5E5E5"> concern that it's as as Rand Paul</font>

111
00:04:14,670 --> 00:04:18,180
<font color="#CCCCCC">is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> climate it's Obamacare light and and</font>

112
00:04:18,180 --> 00:04:19,440
I want to take a step<font color="#E5E5E5"> back because this</font>

113
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:20,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">is only the beginning is going to be all</font>

114
00:04:20,730 --> 00:04:22,770
<font color="#CCCCCC">these arguments and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you know amendments</font>

115
00:04:22,770 --> 00:04:24,300
and changes and then all this<font color="#E5E5E5"> stuff</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

116
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:26,490
so maybe it's a good thing I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

117
00:04:26,490 --> 00:04:28,320
it gets out in the open and the

118
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:30,810
arguments in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the debates begin but the</font>

119
00:04:30,810 --> 00:04:35,280
idea is that it's going to repeal let's

120
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:39,420
see it's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to repeal the demand date</font>

121
00:04:39,420 --> 00:04:41,370
the requirement<font color="#E5E5E5"> that Americans have</font>

122
00:04:41,370 --> 00:04:43,170
health coverage or pay a penalty so you

123
00:04:43,170 --> 00:04:45,090
won't be paying a penalty and it will

124
00:04:45,090 --> 00:04:47,070
even forgive I think backwards the

125
00:04:47,070 --> 00:04:48,720
penalty that you would have<font color="#E5E5E5"> paid for not</font>

126
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:52,500
having health care in 2016 and it's it's

127
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:55,440
also got keeps it gets rid<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the</font>

128
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:57,810
mandate that larger employers provide

129
00:04:57,810 --> 00:04:59,550
health insurance to workers and it also

130
00:04:59,550 --> 00:05:02,100
repeals most of the taxes that Obamacare

131
00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:05,790
imposes and and freezes funding after

132
00:05:05,790 --> 00:05:08,430
<font color="#CCCCCC">20-24 the states that expanded Medicaid</font>

133
00:05:08,430 --> 00:05:10,380
under<font color="#E5E5E5"> the law so it does do a lot of it</font>

134
00:05:10,380 --> 00:05:11,610
does do a lot of<font color="#CCCCCC"> good things I mean</font>

135
00:05:11,610 --> 00:05:13,169
these are you know these taxes are

136
00:05:13,169 --> 00:05:15,840
ridiculously the Medicaid expansion is

137
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:18,780
incredibly expensive but it also it

138
00:05:18,780 --> 00:05:21,030
retains the inquirer<font color="#CCCCCC"> Minh that insurance</font>

139
00:05:21,030 --> 00:05:21,780
cover people with pre-existing

140
00:05:21,780 --> 00:05:24,120
conditions which is<font color="#CCCCCC"> I keep pointing out</font>

141
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:26,610
is government<font color="#E5E5E5"> health care if insurers</font>

142
00:05:26,610 --> 00:05:28,380
have to ensure you<font color="#E5E5E5"> when you're</font>

143
00:05:28,380 --> 00:05:30,660
already sick that's not insurance that's

144
00:05:30,660 --> 00:05:32,370
not how insurance works insurance is a

145
00:05:32,370 --> 00:05:34,050
gamble that you make with the health

146
00:05:34,050 --> 00:05:35,670
company you are gambling that you will

147
00:05:35,670 --> 00:05:37,590
get sick and they are gambling that you

148
00:05:37,590 --> 00:05:38,940
will stay well long enough for them to

149
00:05:38,940 --> 00:05:40,770
collect enough money from from you to

150
00:05:40,770 --> 00:05:43,260
pay for<font color="#E5E5E5"> your being sick so the idea is</font>

151
00:05:43,260 --> 00:05:45,030
that you win either way because<font color="#CCCCCC"> if</font>

152
00:05:45,030 --> 00:05:46,920
you're well you don't care and if you're

153
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:49,410
sick you<font color="#E5E5E5"> get the money so they also has</font>

154
00:05:49,410 --> 00:05:53,880
this kind of weird first of all<font color="#E5E5E5"> it gives</font>

155
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:56,100
tax credits to people to<font color="#CCCCCC"> lower-income</font>

156
00:05:56,100 --> 00:05:59,550
<font color="#CCCCCC">people and older people for health care</font>

157
00:05:59,550 --> 00:06:03,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">so that's kind of a a that's kind of an</font>

158
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,770
entitlement right there and it also

159
00:06:04,770 --> 00:06:06,780
creates this kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of backdoor mandate</font>

160
00:06:06,780 --> 00:06:08,760
where if you let your insurance lapse

161
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:10,230
and you go<font color="#CCCCCC"> back and charges your thirty</font>

162
00:06:10,230 --> 00:06:12,150
percent but I want to talk about<font color="#E5E5E5"> I want</font>

163
00:06:12,150 --> 00:06:13,260
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> look at this from a bigger picture</font>

164
00:06:13,260 --> 00:06:14,370
because later on we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have the</font>

165
00:06:14,370 --> 00:06:15,660
Columbia professor come on and talk

166
00:06:15,660 --> 00:06:17,070
<font color="#CCCCCC">about the deep state and the way it's</font>

167
00:06:17,070 --> 00:06:20,190
roading are right and i want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to talk</font>

168
00:06:20,190 --> 00:06:22,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">about this the state and the growth of</font>

169
00:06:22,020 --> 00:06:23,580
the state because this is what this

170
00:06:23,580 --> 00:06:25,980
health care thing is all about okay now

171
00:06:25,980 --> 00:06:27,690
one of the reasons that people are

172
00:06:27,690 --> 00:06:29,220
always making<font color="#E5E5E5"> the jokes that they listen</font>

173
00:06:29,220 --> 00:06:30,390
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> shapiro show and they get depressed</font>

174
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:32,460
and they listen to me cheer them up

175
00:06:32,460 --> 00:06:34,770
that's recent the reason<font color="#CCCCCC"> i don't get</font>

176
00:06:34,770 --> 00:06:37,110
depressed oddly enough about politics is

177
00:06:37,110 --> 00:06:38,580
because i have a<font color="#E5E5E5"> tragic view of life</font>

178
00:06:38,580 --> 00:06:40,410
that sounds paradoxical but it's not i

179
00:06:40,410 --> 00:06:41,850
believe that freedom is a living thing

180
00:06:41,850 --> 00:06:44,820
and freedom dies at its best freedom in

181
00:06:44,820 --> 00:06:46,950
the past<font color="#E5E5E5"> i think has had maybe a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 400</font>

182
00:06:46,950 --> 00:06:48,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">year</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> lifespan</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> he usually is closer to</font>

183
00:06:48,780 --> 00:06:50,580
100 or 200 years we're doing pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> well</font>

184
00:06:50,580 --> 00:06:53,760
here<font color="#CCCCCC"> i think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and if you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> believe that</font>

185
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:55,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">things die every day is a good day right</font>

186
00:06:55,890 --> 00:06:57,540
<font color="#CCCCCC">i mean it's just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's just like getting</font>

187
00:06:57,540 --> 00:06:59,610
old you know i<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> getting</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> old</font>

188
00:06:59,610 --> 00:07:02,130
but I fight it every step of the way but

189
00:07:02,130 --> 00:07:04,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">I understand that getting old is better</font>

190
00:07:04,260 --> 00:07:06,270
than the alternative which is dying and

191
00:07:06,270 --> 00:07:08,430
also like that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> really I feel about the</font>

192
00:07:08,430 --> 00:07:09,480
government every day that we have

193
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:11,340
freedom is a good day and I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think of</font>

194
00:07:11,340 --> 00:07:13,200
conservatives like doctors you fighting

195
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:14,550
a losing battle to keep something alive

196
00:07:14,550 --> 00:07:16,590
it will ultimately<font color="#E5E5E5"> die but every day you</font>

197
00:07:16,590 --> 00:07:18,810
win you win and that's then that's why I

198
00:07:18,810 --> 00:07:21,030
find<font color="#E5E5E5"> myself rather cheerful</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and things</font>

199
00:07:21,030 --> 00:07:24,420
<font color="#CCCCCC">no</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> no so how do I feel I mean what kills</font>

200
00:07:24,420 --> 00:07:26,460
freedom ultimately is this desire<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

201
00:07:26,460 --> 00:07:29,220
make<font color="#E5E5E5"> things fair okay and that we</font>

202
00:07:29,220 --> 00:07:30,630
understand the desire to make<font color="#E5E5E5"> things</font>

203
00:07:30,630 --> 00:07:32,220
fair but it ultimately bleeds into

204
00:07:32,220 --> 00:07:34,350
equality and equality kills freedom why

205
00:07:34,350 --> 00:07:36,000
does equality kill freedom let's say

206
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,620
you've got<font color="#E5E5E5"> two guys who want to play</font>

207
00:07:37,620 --> 00:07:39,330
<font color="#CCCCCC">basketball one of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> them was LeBron James</font>

208
00:07:39,330 --> 00:07:40,249
and one of them is

209
00:07:40,249 --> 00:07:43,129
me<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay if I want to be equal to LeBron</font>

210
00:07:43,129 --> 00:07:44,659
James there's only one way to do it I

211
00:07:44,659 --> 00:07:46,819
<font color="#CCCCCC">have to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> hobble LeBron</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> James right i have</font>

212
00:07:46,819 --> 00:07:48,289
to make my bond<font color="#CCCCCC"> James worse because I</font>

213
00:07:48,289 --> 00:07:50,719
can't be as good as LeBron James because

214
00:07:50,719 --> 00:07:52,909
reality nature does<font color="#CCCCCC"> not create a quality</font>

215
00:07:52,909 --> 00:07:55,639
<font color="#CCCCCC">and people so you say well</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay you</font>

216
00:07:55,639 --> 00:07:57,559
can't be as good as LeBron James but at

217
00:07:57,559 --> 00:07:58,789
least you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can have as much money as</font>

218
00:07:58,789 --> 00:08:00,649
lebron james as why is it fair that he

219
00:08:00,649 --> 00:08:02,119
puts a ball through a hoop and gets to

220
00:08:02,119 --> 00:08:04,429
be a gazillionaire and you are witty and

221
00:08:04,429 --> 00:08:06,199
brilliant attractive sexually desirable

222
00:08:06,199 --> 00:08:07,939
and you're not you know you're just

223
00:08:07,939 --> 00:08:10,069
scraping by right so that's that<font color="#CCCCCC"> is the</font>

224
00:08:10,069 --> 00:08:11,449
problem so I and I agree with<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

225
00:08:11,449 --> 00:08:13,219
argument so the only way I can do that

226
00:08:13,219 --> 00:08:15,619
<font color="#CCCCCC">is I can take LeBrons money and give it</font>

227
00:08:15,619 --> 00:08:17,360
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> me and why does that get rid of his</font>

228
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:19,699
freedom what because he creates his

229
00:08:19,699 --> 00:08:21,499
money through his time and his hard work

230
00:08:21,499 --> 00:08:24,139
and his training and his talent<font color="#CCCCCC"> and all</font>

231
00:08:24,139 --> 00:08:26,419
those things<font color="#E5E5E5"> belong to him if they</font>

232
00:08:26,419 --> 00:08:28,489
belong to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the government why does the</font>

233
00:08:28,489 --> 00:08:30,679
government get to say<font color="#E5E5E5"> that these belong</font>

234
00:08:30,679 --> 00:08:32,688
to us we own your talent we own your

235
00:08:32,688 --> 00:08:34,669
time we own your training therefore if

236
00:08:34,669 --> 00:08:36,620
<font color="#CCCCCC">we think Clavin deserves the money we</font>

237
00:08:36,620 --> 00:08:38,120
can<font color="#E5E5E5"> give</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it to him why does the</font>

238
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:39,860
government have that right it doesn't so

239
00:08:39,860 --> 00:08:42,679
a quality is the enemy of freedom always

240
00:08:42,679 --> 00:08:44,839
you know we can<font color="#CCCCCC"> make</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> things a little bit</font>

241
00:08:44,839 --> 00:08:46,309
there we can say that Clavin doesn't

242
00:08:46,309 --> 00:08:47,959
have to die gasping in the street

243
00:08:47,959 --> 00:08:49,819
because he can't afford you know food

244
00:08:49,819 --> 00:08:52,160
maybe LeBron can put in a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit of</font>

245
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:54,230
<font color="#CCCCCC">money for that maybe you know but still</font>

246
00:08:54,230 --> 00:08:56,420
it's LeBrons money he worked for he<font color="#CCCCCC"> paid</font>

247
00:08:56,420 --> 00:08:58,939
his his his freedom depends on his being

248
00:08:58,939 --> 00:09:01,430
able to keep the sweat of his brow and

249
00:09:01,430 --> 00:09:03,529
that is why conservatives are always

250
00:09:03,529 --> 00:09:04,939
fighting the state you know they're

251
00:09:04,939 --> 00:09:07,939
fighting the state because<font color="#E5E5E5"> they know you</font>

252
00:09:07,939 --> 00:09:10,220
<font color="#CCCCCC">know here's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the thing if</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> healthcare were</font>

253
00:09:10,220 --> 00:09:12,500
free I would<font color="#CCCCCC"> support it if healthcare</font>

254
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:14,089
could be free I would<font color="#E5E5E5"> support it if</font>

255
00:09:14,089 --> 00:09:16,040
<font color="#CCCCCC">healthcare</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> could be free Ben Shapiro</font>

256
00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:18,110
would support it you know sean hannity

257
00:09:18,110 --> 00:09:19,399
was where all the conservatives would

258
00:09:19,399 --> 00:09:21,410
support we're not we're not mean but

259
00:09:21,410 --> 00:09:24,079
it's not free nothing is free somebody

260
00:09:24,079 --> 00:09:26,420
has to pay<font color="#CCCCCC"> for it and when somebody pays</font>

261
00:09:26,420 --> 00:09:28,370
for it his freedom is taken away the

262
00:09:28,370 --> 00:09:30,379
state never gives you anything it never

263
00:09:30,379 --> 00:09:32,480
gives you anything it only takes things

264
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:35,480
away it trades you freedom it trades you

265
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:38,449
stuff for your freedom for its power

266
00:09:38,449 --> 00:09:40,579
your freedom and that's built into the

267
00:09:40,579 --> 00:09:42,079
state that doesn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> mean that doesn't</font>

268
00:09:42,079 --> 00:09:43,550
mean the leftist is necessarily an

269
00:09:43,550 --> 00:09:45,199
evildoer he's probably just trying to

270
00:09:45,199 --> 00:09:46,730
help he may just<font color="#E5E5E5"> be trying to help it's</font>

271
00:09:46,730 --> 00:09:49,069
built into the system<font color="#E5E5E5"> that equality</font>

272
00:09:49,069 --> 00:09:51,769
takes away your freedom everything the

273
00:09:51,769 --> 00:09:53,120
government gives you takes away your

274
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:53,660
freedom

275
00:09:53,660 --> 00:09:55,790
so the problem<font color="#E5E5E5"> the Conservatives have</font>

276
00:09:55,790 --> 00:10:01,820
with Obamacare is that that it takes

277
00:10:01,820 --> 00:10:03,530
people's freedom away right if you give

278
00:10:03,530 --> 00:10:05,420
<font color="#CCCCCC">people health care what do you get well</font>

279
00:10:05,420 --> 00:10:07,430
not only are you taking somebody's money

280
00:10:07,430 --> 00:10:08,720
to pay for somebody else's health care

281
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:10,310
which is limiting their freedom but

282
00:10:10,310 --> 00:10:12,140
you're putting somebody into a system

283
00:10:12,140 --> 00:10:13,670
where the state now gets to make choices

284
00:10:13,670 --> 00:10:15,890
what if you smoke well should the state

285
00:10:15,890 --> 00:10:18,170
be<font color="#E5E5E5"> asked to pay for you for it if you</font>

286
00:10:18,170 --> 00:10:19,490
get<font color="#CCCCCC"> to lung cancer because you smoke</font>

287
00:10:19,490 --> 00:10:21,140
didn't you do something wrong didn't you

288
00:10:21,140 --> 00:10:22,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">cause your own lung cancer shouldn't be</font>

289
00:10:22,820 --> 00:10:24,650
able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to prevent you from smoking</font>

290
00:10:24,650 --> 00:10:25,850
shouldn't the state be able to say you

291
00:10:25,850 --> 00:10:27,770
can't smoke because we have to pay for

292
00:10:27,770 --> 00:10:30,680
the lung<font color="#CCCCCC"> cancer you get now because</font>

293
00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:32,540
liberals love that argument because they

294
00:10:32,540 --> 00:10:33,980
want to stop everybody from smoking but

295
00:10:33,980 --> 00:10:34,970
they don't love<font color="#CCCCCC"> it so much when you</font>

296
00:10:34,970 --> 00:10:36,410
start to say well you know illegitimate

297
00:10:36,410 --> 00:10:38,090
children cost the state money too

298
00:10:38,090 --> 00:10:39,500
because a lot of them end up in jail

299
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:41,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">single-parent homes cost the state money</font>

300
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:42,920
so should the state be able to say when

301
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:44,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">you can have sex with whom you can have</font>

302
00:10:44,420 --> 00:10:46,010
sex whether you have to be protected

303
00:10:46,010 --> 00:10:47,600
when you have sex I mean this state can

304
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:49,640
make all kinds<font color="#CCCCCC"> of decisions once it's</font>

305
00:10:49,640 --> 00:10:51,440
got a hold of healthcare healthcare is

306
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:54,410
the holy grail for leftist because it

307
00:10:54,410 --> 00:10:57,620
gives them<font color="#E5E5E5"> all this power now Obamacare</font>

308
00:10:57,620 --> 00:10:59,810
and this is the problem<font color="#E5E5E5"> the GOP has</font>

309
00:10:59,810 --> 00:11:03,170
Obamacare is an entitlement it's fun but

310
00:11:03,170 --> 00:11:05,690
it's unpaid for the idea of Obamacare is

311
00:11:05,690 --> 00:11:07,550
everybody is forced to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get health care</font>

312
00:11:07,550 --> 00:11:09,740
and so the healthy young people are

313
00:11:09,740 --> 00:11:13,160
paying for<font color="#E5E5E5"> the sick old people right but</font>

314
00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:14,480
the healthy young people are saying like

315
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:17,330
<font color="#CCCCCC">that I don't want to do it I don't want</font>

316
00:11:17,330 --> 00:11:18,800
to do I don't even care if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you put level</font>

317
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:20,570
of penalty on me I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> not going to do it</font>

318
00:11:20,570 --> 00:11:23,390
it was built to collapse was built to be

319
00:11:23,390 --> 00:11:26,240
unfunded and<font color="#CCCCCC"> collapsed because Hillary</font>

320
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:28,010
Clinton was going to be<font color="#CCCCCC"> president that</font>

321
00:11:28,010 --> 00:11:29,780
Democrats were going to own the Congress

322
00:11:29,780 --> 00:11:31,790
forever and when it collapsed they would

323
00:11:31,790 --> 00:11:33,410
be there<font color="#E5E5E5"> to make</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it a single-payer</font>

324
00:11:33,410 --> 00:11:34,940
system which basically means government

325
00:11:34,940 --> 00:11:36,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">health care and then they would have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> all</font>

326
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:38,390
that power all that control over every

327
00:11:38,390 --> 00:11:39,620
decision you make<font color="#E5E5E5"> because it would all</font>

328
00:11:39,620 --> 00:11:40,880
affect your health and we'd all have to

329
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:43,370
pay for<font color="#CCCCCC"> it so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> they get</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to say what you</font>

330
00:11:43,370 --> 00:11:46,520
do that was the plan<font color="#E5E5E5"> honk you know</font>

331
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:49,010
Donald Trump got elected things didn't

332
00:11:49,010 --> 00:11:51,560
work out and so<font color="#CCCCCC"> now the GOP is stuck</font>

333
00:11:51,560 --> 00:11:53,420
with<font color="#E5E5E5"> this thing and how do they get rid</font>

334
00:11:53,420 --> 00:11:55,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">of it here is the problem</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with getting</font>

335
00:11:55,520 --> 00:11:58,280
rid of it what do<font color="#E5E5E5"> we do about the poor</font>

336
00:11:58,280 --> 00:11:59,900
nobody wants<font color="#CCCCCC"> to say this is right</font>

337
00:11:59,900 --> 00:12:01,280
because they're all talking<font color="#E5E5E5"> about is</font>

338
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:02,630
making sure everybody has insurance

339
00:12:02,630 --> 00:12:05,300
that's that is<font color="#E5E5E5"> not the problem if you</font>

340
00:12:05,300 --> 00:12:05,900
may

341
00:12:05,900 --> 00:12:09,530
if you created a system in which all

342
00:12:09,530 --> 00:12:11,540
insurers were competing with all other

343
00:12:11,540 --> 00:12:14,240
insurers and people<font color="#E5E5E5"> could just get</font>

344
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:15,890
insurance that only cover them in case

345
00:12:15,890 --> 00:12:18,800
of the disaster right so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll pay for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> my</font>

346
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:21,140
checkups i'll pay for<font color="#CCCCCC"> my you know</font>

347
00:12:21,140 --> 00:12:23,600
whatever night hearing aid or whatever I

348
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:25,490
need you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'll pay for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> some some</font>

349
00:12:25,490 --> 00:12:29,060
meds prices drop television sets come

350
00:12:29,060 --> 00:12:31,190
out and they<font color="#E5E5E5"> cost a million dollars and</font>

351
00:12:31,190 --> 00:12:33,140
then within a year that cost you know

352
00:12:33,140 --> 00:12:35,060
five hundred dollars because this

353
00:12:35,060 --> 00:12:36,950
competition right the prices<font color="#CCCCCC"> go down</font>

354
00:12:36,950 --> 00:12:39,590
once everybody is buying in that would

355
00:12:39,590 --> 00:12:41,990
help happen with<font color="#E5E5E5"> health care</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> too except</font>

356
00:12:41,990 --> 00:12:44,090
in cases of catastrophic you know care

357
00:12:44,090 --> 00:12:45,410
where you need catastrophic care so you

358
00:12:45,410 --> 00:12:47,990
get insurance for that that's still

359
00:12:47,990 --> 00:12:51,070
still you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have the poor so every time</font>

360
00:12:51,070 --> 00:12:55,000
Republicans try to fix this system<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">nobody talks about is people talk about</font>

374
00:13:22,610 --> 00:13:25,340
these skyrocketing<font color="#CCCCCC"> cost of health care</font>

375
00:13:25,340 --> 00:13:26,750
that's not what is happening what is

376
00:13:26,750 --> 00:13:29,540
happening is until let's see what is

377
00:13:29,540 --> 00:13:32,690
this 2016 until about a hundred years

378
00:13:32,690 --> 00:13:34,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">ago health care we didn't have any help</font>

379
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:36,980
here you<font color="#E5E5E5"> couldn't do anything maybe 150</font>

380
00:13:36,980 --> 00:13:39,110
years ago doctors used to kill you you

381
00:13:39,110 --> 00:13:40,520
know they come over<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> bleed you you</font>

382
00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:42,260
know they come over<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> do this stuff</font>

383
00:13:42,260 --> 00:13:43,820
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> they was like magic it was like</font>

384
00:13:43,820 --> 00:13:45,590
witch doctor magic until the invention

385
00:13:45,590 --> 00:13:50,630
the discovery<font color="#E5E5E5"> of antibiotics by men such</font>

386
00:13:50,630 --> 00:13:53,270
as we recall from our opening it until

387
00:13:53,270 --> 00:13:54,860
the discovery of antibiotics you know

388
00:13:54,860 --> 00:13:56,360
they weren't really doing anything now

389
00:13:56,360 --> 00:13:57,530
they can<font color="#E5E5E5"> help you now they can do</font>

390
00:13:57,530 --> 00:13:59,120
amazing things that<font color="#E5E5E5"> can keep you alive</font>

391
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:00,650
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> get your limbs they can do all this</font>

392
00:14:00,650 --> 00:14:02,900
stuff and it all costs<font color="#E5E5E5"> money so the</font>

393
00:14:02,900 --> 00:14:06,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">question is what is going to happen to</font>

394
00:14:06,050 --> 00:14:09,650
the poor and personally I think there's

395
00:14:09,650 --> 00:14:10,760
going to have to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> an answer to this</font>

396
00:14:10,760 --> 00:14:12,680
one of the things<font color="#E5E5E5"> about understanding</font>

397
00:14:12,680 --> 00:14:14,270
that freedom dies is understanding you

398
00:14:14,270 --> 00:14:15,710
have to make little compromises as you

399
00:14:15,710 --> 00:14:17,240
go along just<font color="#CCCCCC"> like you do when you have</font>

400
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:17,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">when you get all</font>

401
00:14:17,820 --> 00:14:19,980
you know like<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> don't want to concede</font>

402
00:14:19,980 --> 00:14:21,750
anything to old age but eventually I

403
00:14:21,750 --> 00:14:24,000
stopped<font color="#CCCCCC"> doing martial arts because I was</font>

404
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,040
going to get catastrophic<font color="#CCCCCC"> Lee injured</font>

405
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:27,990
you know you give up little bit during

406
00:14:27,990 --> 00:14:31,830
<font color="#CCCCCC">the 30s you know conservatives lost the</font>

407
00:14:31,830 --> 00:14:33,930
argument over welfare we started to have

408
00:14:33,930 --> 00:14:37,140
a welfare state as all free nations

409
00:14:37,140 --> 00:14:38,910
start to have a welfare state and yes is

410
00:14:38,910 --> 00:14:41,100
it the beginning of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the end yes it is do</font>

411
00:14:41,100 --> 00:14:43,080
you have to do it yes you do why because

412
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:45,000
freedom creates wealth and wealth makes

413
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,890
people say well you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> how come people</font>

414
00:14:46,890 --> 00:14:47,880
are dying on the streets when our

415
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:49,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">country is so rich and all this stuff so</font>

416
00:14:49,650 --> 00:14:51,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">that is something that happens and then</font>

417
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:53,370
you know you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to fight the growth of</font>

418
00:14:53,370 --> 00:14:55,230
welfare but it slowly grows and the same

419
00:14:55,230 --> 00:14:57,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">thing is true of health</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> care the only</font>

420
00:14:57,510 --> 00:15:00,510
thing i would say before<font color="#CCCCCC"> we cut away and</font>

421
00:15:00,510 --> 00:15:01,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">bring on our guess the only thing i</font>

422
00:15:01,650 --> 00:15:03,840
would say is it it is<font color="#CCCCCC"> possible</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that the</font>

423
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:08,330
GOP should grasp the nettle este station

424
00:15:08,330 --> 00:15:11,010
understand that there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to have to</font>

425
00:15:11,010 --> 00:15:14,100
be<font color="#E5E5E5"> an entitlement for the poor the poor</font>

426
00:15:14,100 --> 00:15:16,050
can no longer go to their families and

427
00:15:16,050 --> 00:15:17,310
get the kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of health care that people</font>

428
00:15:17,310 --> 00:15:19,740
can<font color="#E5E5E5"> get there may have to be a separate</font>

429
00:15:19,740 --> 00:15:21,960
bill to deal with this may be trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

430
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:24,270
deal<font color="#CCCCCC"> with it all in this one bill is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

431
00:15:24,270 --> 00:15:25,620
big mistake they're making because

432
00:15:25,620 --> 00:15:27,480
essentially what this bill does so far

433
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:30,810
is it except the logic of Obamacare that

434
00:15:30,810 --> 00:15:32,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">the government has to do something for</font>

435
00:15:32,130 --> 00:15:34,110
everybody has to have health care to

436
00:15:34,110 --> 00:15:35,700
provide health care for everybody it

437
00:15:35,700 --> 00:15:38,060
accepts that logic which is the logic of

438
00:15:38,060 --> 00:15:40,710
equality government growth and

439
00:15:40,710 --> 00:15:42,450
ultimately the destruction of freedom so

440
00:15:42,450 --> 00:15:43,560
let's see<font color="#CCCCCC"> what happens</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I mean this is</font>

441
00:15:43,560 --> 00:15:44,970
not<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> time to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> panic not the time to</font>

442
00:15:44,970 --> 00:15:46,500
run around it is the time to watch the

443
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:49,320
fight the big big thing I'll conclude

444
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:51,870
with this is that Trump is Trump's

445
00:15:51,870 --> 00:15:53,970
reputation is riding on this because<font color="#E5E5E5"> up</font>

446
00:15:53,970 --> 00:15:56,400
till now everything has been executive

447

451
00:16:05,190 --> 00:16:07,380
supported this bill but we'll have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>
