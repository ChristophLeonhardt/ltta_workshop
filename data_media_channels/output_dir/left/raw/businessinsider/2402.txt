00:00:08,029 --> 00:00:10,530
welcome back<font color="#CCCCCC"> to you ask and we answer</font>

2
00:00:10,530 --> 00:00:13,170
let's start right in<font color="#E5E5E5"> Francis snoot has</font>

3
00:00:13,170 --> 00:00:15,240
asked us why don't you put posts on this

4
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:17,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">site through a spell check before you</font>

5
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:19,289
<font color="#E5E5E5">post them that is a great question and</font>

6
00:00:19,289 --> 00:00:20,550
that is<font color="#E5E5E5"> the question that we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ask</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> our</font>

7
00:00:20,550 --> 00:00:24,210
editors every day and I unfortunately

8
00:00:24,210 --> 00:00:26,160
think that the<font color="#E5E5E5"> truth is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that our editors</font>

9
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:30,179
are lazy la zy but fortunately we have

10
00:00:30,179 --> 00:00:32,308
<font color="#E5E5E5">given up trying to encourage spell</font>

11
00:00:32,308 --> 00:00:33,989
checking and we've actually put a copy

12
00:00:33,989 --> 00:00:35,610
editing system in place which should be

13
00:00:35,610 --> 00:00:36,750
<font color="#CCCCCC">in place</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> by the end of this week so</font>

14
00:00:36,750 --> 00:00:38,219
hopefully things will improve but if

15
00:00:38,219 --> 00:00:39,629
they don't please keep complaining

16
00:00:39,629 --> 00:00:41,820
because that's our only weapon in<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

17
00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:43,800
war against laziness on the part of our

18
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:47,070
editors<font color="#E5E5E5"> why is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Tim Armstrong the CEO</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

19
00:00:47,070 --> 00:00:49,739
AOL also going to be the chairman of the

20
00:00:49,739 --> 00:00:52,680
board in addition<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the CEO in my</font>

21
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:54,000
opinion and this is Gordon speaking

22
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,010
chairman should always be an outside

23
00:00:56,010 --> 00:00:58,920
director to minimize shenanigans usually

24
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:01,379
I would agree with that in this case AOL

25
00:01:01,379 --> 00:01:03,600
has a lot bigger problems to worry<font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font>

26
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:05,820
than whether<font color="#CCCCCC"> tim armstrong is also the</font>

27
00:01:05,820 --> 00:01:08,760
chairman of the company<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> really just</font>

28
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:10,860
retool the business but in any<font color="#E5E5E5"> event yes</font>

29
00:01:10,860 --> 00:01:12,510
probably would have been<font color="#CCCCCC"> a good idea</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i</font>

30
00:01:12,510 --> 00:01:14,400
<font color="#CCCCCC">think the other issue is that AOL</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> has</font>

31
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:17,549
elected a very safe board pretty boring

32
00:01:17,549 --> 00:01:20,040
actually but probably decent governance

33
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:21,210
in place so<font color="#CCCCCC"> i wouldn't worry about that</font>

34
00:01:21,210 --> 00:01:23,040
what<font color="#CCCCCC"> i would worry about is how AOL gets</font>

35
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:25,110
out and rebuilds its business with

36
00:01:25,110 --> 00:01:27,390
regard to former<font color="#E5E5E5"> goldman sachs alumni</font>

37
00:01:27,390 --> 00:01:29,640
literally taking over the government and

38
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:32,070
our financial system what can be done to

39
00:01:32,070 --> 00:01:34,530
extricate them that is a<font color="#E5E5E5"> tough question</font>

40
00:01:34,530 --> 00:01:37,680
from alert I don't know the<font color="#CCCCCC"> answer I</font>

41
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:39,479
think the<font color="#CCCCCC"> answer is we've got to hire</font>

42
00:01:39,479 --> 00:01:41,100
some people<font color="#E5E5E5"> from Morgan Stanley and I</font>

43
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:43,409
say<font color="#E5E5E5"> that seriously we've got to hire</font>

44
00:01:43,409 --> 00:01:45,060
from elsewhere in the economy but I

45
00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:47,189
don't see how you're ever going to fully

46
00:01:47,189 --> 00:01:49,200
eliminate this Washington Goldman

47
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:51,060
corridor that is developed I think what

48
00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:53,009
actually is a lot more<font color="#E5E5E5"> important is to</font>

49
00:01:53,009 --> 00:01:56,100
put in provisions where taxpayers simply

50
00:01:56,100 --> 00:01:57,750
do not<font color="#CCCCCC"> have to come to the rescue of</font>

51
00:01:57,750 --> 00:02:00,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">Goldman Morgan and all the other firms</font>

52
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:02,130
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> the simple solution there in my</font>

53
00:02:02,130 --> 00:02:05,070
opinion is to not just not have firms

54
00:02:05,070 --> 00:02:06,689
that are too big<font color="#E5E5E5"> to fail but to</font>

55
00:02:06,689 --> 00:02:08,910
construct ways to allow them to fail

56
00:02:08,910 --> 00:02:10,889
without destroying<font color="#E5E5E5"> the system and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this I</font>

57
00:02:10,889 --> 00:02:12,959
<font color="#E5E5E5">think is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> actually relatively easy</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to do</font>

58
00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:13,470
by

59
00:02:13,470 --> 00:02:16,230
a system whereby their debt converts to

60
00:02:16,230 --> 00:02:17,550
equity if they get to a point where

61
00:02:17,550 --> 00:02:19,680
their capital is low enough we<font color="#E5E5E5"> can set</font>

62
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:22,230
that up now you can not have such an

63
00:02:22,230 --> 00:02:23,550
issue that we had which is obviously

64
00:02:23,550 --> 00:02:25,590
<font color="#CCCCCC">Hughes moral hazard but I don't know how</font>

65
00:02:25,590 --> 00:02:27,000
we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to get away from Goldman</font>

66
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,800
Sachs actually being great training for

67
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:31,020
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> government if people can buy</font>

68
00:02:31,020 --> 00:02:32,610
affordable health insurance that<font color="#CCCCCC"> is not</font>

69
00:02:32,610 --> 00:02:34,260
tied to the workplace well that spur

70
00:02:34,260 --> 00:02:36,030
innovation and entrepreneurs in America

71
00:02:36,030 --> 00:02:38,070
I don't know if it's Spurs innovation

72
00:02:38,070 --> 00:02:39,600
and entrepreneurs but I think it's a

73
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:42,150
great<font color="#CCCCCC"> idea you go back in history why is</font>

74
00:02:42,150 --> 00:02:43,950
it that employers are supposed to pay

75
00:02:43,950 --> 00:02:45,360
for<font color="#CCCCCC"> health care and any company that</font>

76
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:47,850
doesn't offer health care is a greedy

77
00:02:47,850 --> 00:02:49,560
company that isn't looking out for its

78
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:51,600
employees that's because after<font color="#E5E5E5"> World War</font>

79
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:53,209
two when<font color="#E5E5E5"> we got into wage controls</font>

80
00:02:53,209 --> 00:02:55,920
companies want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to figure out some way of</font>

81
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:57,630
paying people more<font color="#E5E5E5"> without actually</font>

82
00:02:57,630 --> 00:02:59,310
raising their salary and that went to

83
00:02:59,310 --> 00:03:01,020
benefits they started offering health

84
00:03:01,020 --> 00:03:02,910
care and there we went that is sort of a

85
00:03:02,910 --> 00:03:05,459
silly system I think and ultimately<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

86
00:03:05,459 --> 00:03:07,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">would be nice to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> dlink employers and</font>

87
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:09,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">healthcare put it onto the government</font>

88
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:12,090
put it somewhere but change<font color="#E5E5E5"> the current</font>

89
00:03:12,090 --> 00:03:13,800
system and yes<font color="#E5E5E5"> hopefully that would free</font>

90
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:15,810
up capacity for people to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be more</font>

91
00:03:15,810 --> 00:03:18,780
entrepreneurial and so forth because one

92
00:03:18,780 --> 00:03:20,760
problem with being an entrepreneur<font color="#E5E5E5"> or a</font>

93
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:22,560
sole practitioner or a freelancer or

94
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:24,720
anything like that is that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you don't</font>

95
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:26,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">have any health care is the recent</font>

96
00:03:26,850 --> 00:03:28,650
influx of slide show posts more of a

97
00:03:28,650 --> 00:03:30,959
coincidence<font color="#CCCCCC"> or part of a plan it is part</font>

98
00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:33,000
of a plan and here at the<font color="#E5E5E5"> business</font>

99
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,769
decider we do not call<font color="#E5E5E5"> them slide shows</font>

100
00:03:34,769 --> 00:03:37,620
we call them features so please<font color="#E5E5E5"> ask us</font>

101
00:03:37,620 --> 00:03:40,080
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> features but in all seriousness I</font>

102
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:41,760
actually think that<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you look at</font>

103
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:45,150
different media each one has a way of

104
00:03:45,150 --> 00:03:47,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">telling stories that is endemic to that</font>

105
00:03:47,190 --> 00:03:49,320
media the media sort of is really

106
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:51,330
particularly good for that in this case

107
00:03:51,330 --> 00:03:52,980
when we want to write<font color="#CCCCCC"> a long post with a</font>

108
00:03:52,980 --> 00:03:54,420
lot of<font color="#CCCCCC"> different segments we have two</font>

109
00:03:54,420 --> 00:03:56,910
choices you can either scroll a long way

110
00:03:56,910 --> 00:03:59,010
which some people like and we will

111
00:03:59,010 --> 00:04:00,540
definitely<font color="#E5E5E5"> try to offer that option as</font>

112
00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:02,820
much as possible or you can simply click

113
00:04:02,820 --> 00:04:04,320
a button and go through as if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you were</font>

114
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:06,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">going through a presentation I think</font>

115
00:04:06,090 --> 00:04:07,290
there's a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be said</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to the ladder</font>

116
00:04:07,290 --> 00:04:08,820
and definitely it creates a lot more

117
00:04:08,820 --> 00:04:11,010
page views for us and lots of time<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

118
00:04:11,010 --> 00:04:12,570
creates<font color="#CCCCCC"> the opportunity for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> advertising</font>

119
00:04:12,570 --> 00:04:14,280
so it's certainly<font color="#E5E5E5"> good for us but</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i'd</font>

120
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:17,298
say that i actually prefer the slideshow

121
00:04:17,298 --> 00:04:20,100
motif a lot to having to scroll

122
00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:21,779
endlessly<font color="#E5E5E5"> i think it breaks it up and it</font>

123
00:04:21,779 --> 00:04:23,729
makes you an able to make a point and

124
00:04:23,729 --> 00:04:25,140
<font color="#CCCCCC">have an image</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> with a reveal and</font>

125
00:04:25,140 --> 00:04:27,060
everything else some of our<font color="#CCCCCC"> editors just</font>

126
00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:28,800
so if you<font color="#CCCCCC"> keep complaining about that</font>

127
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:31,020
you'll definitely get some hoes an as in

128
00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:32,340
the newsroom but we will<font color="#CCCCCC"> keep revisiting</font>

129
00:04:32,340 --> 00:04:34,410
it will try not<font color="#E5E5E5"> to completely data lose</font>

130
00:04:34,410 --> 00:04:36,360
you what are your<font color="#E5E5E5"> thoughts on senator</font>

131
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:38,370
Dodds proposal to create freeze credit

132
00:04:38,370 --> 00:04:40,320
card interest rates I think it's

133
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:42,360
terrible not because companies aren't

134
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:44,940
being absolutely outrageous in jacking

135
00:04:44,940 --> 00:04:46,830
up rates and we've had<font color="#E5E5E5"> some stories on</font>

136
00:04:46,830 --> 00:04:48,450
the site recently of Citigroup raising

137
00:04:48,450 --> 00:04:50,310
rates to thirty percent and so forth

138
00:04:50,310 --> 00:04:52,800
which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> just outrageous but the idea of</font>

139
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:54,060
again the government coming in and

140
00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:55,860
artificially saying you got to freeze

141
00:04:55,860 --> 00:04:58,650
rates that certainly goes too far for my

142
00:04:58,650 --> 00:05:00,120
point of view in terms of what the

143
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:01,830
government should be doing why have<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

144
00:05:01,830 --> 00:05:04,050
guys de-emphasize the green<font color="#E5E5E5"> sheet which</font>

145
00:05:04,050 --> 00:05:06,810
is our segment that is focused on

146
00:05:06,810 --> 00:05:09,360
infrastructure and green technology and

147
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:11,490
things like that we have emphasized it

148
00:05:11,490 --> 00:05:12,900
because the great editor of the green

149
00:05:12,900 --> 00:05:15,360
sheet jro is now moved over to media and

150
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:17,970
we need an excellent new editor on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

151
00:05:17,970 --> 00:05:19,500
green sheet so if this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is something you</font>
