PEOPLE ACROSS THE COUNTRY IN THE PAST THREE YEARS. ERIC: THANK YOU SO MUCH BEARD ARTHEL APPEARED ARTHEL: JOINING ME NOW IS WHILE THE FAIREST, NATIONAL SECURITY AND FOREIGN AFFAIRS. SOMEONE, LET'S JUMP RIGHT IN. THIS GUY WAS ON THE TERROR ATTACK IS SOMEWHAT DO THESE TYPES OF ATTACKS SIGNALED THE END OF ISOTOPIC COLLECTED TERROR GROUP IN THAT IT NO LONGER HAS THE COHESIVE INFRASTRUCTURE IT ONCE DID? I DON'T HAVE THE SECOND PART, MEANING THE LINKS BETWEEN THOSE JIHADIS WHO ARE IN THE WEST EUROPE NORTH AMERICA, AUSTRALIA AND OTHER PLACES IN ISIS PIC TWO DIMENSIONS. ONE IS ORGANIZATIONAL, MEANING IF ISIS NEW BUT THE PHONE CALLS, E-MAILS, THAT ORGANIZATIONAL, THEN YES THAT IS PART OF ISIS. BUT IF YOU ARE INSPIRED OR INDOCTRINATED IN AN ISIS CLAIMED THE DVD, DOESN'T HAVE TO BE A MEMBER OF ISIS. IT'S NOT MEMBER OF ANY ORGANIZATION. HE WAS KILLED. ISIS CLAIMED AS A MARTYR FOR THEIR OWN PROPAGANDA PURPOSES. AND STILL COME A LONE ATTACKS ARE DEADLY. THEY ARE MENACING. HOW CAN THE ANTI-TERROR AGENCY IS MINIMIZE THESE ATTACKS? UP THE BIG QUESTION OF THE DECADE NOW AT THIS POINT IN TIME. IF WE DEFEAT ISIS ON THE GROUND IN THE MIDDLE EAST AND WE ARE. BUT YOU MENTIONED EARLIER IN THE SHOW THAT ISIS OPERATIONAL IN INDONESIA AND AFGHANISTAN, NIGERIA AND OTHER PLACES. BUT SUPPOSE WE WILL BE ABLE TO BRING THEM DOWN. THE PROBLEM IS THAT ISIS HAS OR HE CREATED A IN THE WEST. HE WOULD NEED MANY YEARS BEFORE WE CAN COUNTER THEM. EVEN HERE AT HOME IN THE UNITED STATES, WHEN THE SOVIET UNION IT TOOK A FEW YEARS BEFORE THE MARK SAYS STARTED TO BE DISMANTLED. IT'S GOING TO TAKE SOME TIME. ERIC: MEANWHILE, THE U.S., EUROPE TO BE RESIGNED THAT THESE TYPES OF ATTACKS ARE JUST GOING TO KEEP HAPPENING? MOBILIZATION BEGINS BY EDUCATION. THE LEADERS OF THE NATION NEEDS TO DO MORE OF ADDRESSING THE PUBLIC IN OUR EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM START THEIR INTERMEDIA OBVIOUSLY.
