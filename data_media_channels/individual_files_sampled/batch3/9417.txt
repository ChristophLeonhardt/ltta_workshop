NARROWING DOWN THEIR CANDIDATES FOR GOVERNOR. JONATHAN HUNT HAS MORE. IT'S GOOD TO SEE YOU, DANA. WE HAD A FLOW OF VOTERS AT THIS PARTICULAR POLLING PLACE. THE TOUGHEST FIGHT ON THIS PRIMARY DAY, ON THE DEMOCRAT'S SIDE, WHERE 63-YEAR-OLD FORMER TEACHER, CHRIS G., AS SHE'S NONE, PAINTS HERSELF AS THE MORE PROGRESSIVE CANDIDATES. SHE'S THE ENDORSEMENT OF HILLARY CLINTON AND SHE SAYS SHE'S THE CANDIDATE THAT CAN BEST UNDERSTAND THE AVERAGE VOTER. IF YOU WANT TO GOVERN PEOPLE, KNOW HOW THEY LIVE, WHAT IS WHAT MAKES THEIR COMMUNITY, I'M THE ONLY ONE OUT THERE DOING IT. HER OPPONENT IS STEVE SCISSILAC. HE TOUTS HIMSELF AS HAVING THE EXPERIENCE TO GET THIS DONE. LIKE EVERY CANDIDATE, HE TOO IS TRYING TO WORK OUT HOW TO DEAL WITH THE SPECTOR OF PRESIDENT TRUMP. WE DISAGREE OPEN SOME ISSUES, BUT I'M STATING MY CASE. I'M NOT ARGUING SOMEBODY ELSE. I WANT PEOPLE TO UNDERSTAND WHAT I STAND FOR AND WHERE I WANT TO GO. ON THE REPUBLICAN SIDE, THE PRIMARY DOESN'T APPEAR TO BE CLOSE. THE LEADING CANDIDATE IS ADAM LAXEL, THE CURRENTLY ATTORNEY GENERAL. HE'S LOOKING TO NOVEMBER AND SAYING HE CAN BEAT WHATEVER DEMOCRAT WINS THE PARTY AND HE'S DISMISSING TALK OF A SO-CALLED BLUE WAVE. THERE IS NO BLUE WAVE HERE. DOESN'T EXIST. WE'RE LACKING FORWARD TO A RED WAVE. CONFIDENT YOU'LL BE THE NEXT GOVERNOR OF NEVADA? WE FEEL GOOD ABOUT THIS RACE. CLOSE POLLS AT 7:00 P.M. WESTERN TIME. WE EXPECT TO CALL THE REPUBLICAN PRIMARY RACE ALMOST IMMEDIATELY. LIKELY TO BE A GOOD BIT LONGER
