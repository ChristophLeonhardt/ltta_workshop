TODAY DRAMATIC NEWS INVOLVING THE SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE. CENK? [LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, WE GOT HIM] DOWN GOES RYAN! DOWN GOES PAUL RYAN! COME ON, YOU KNOW YOU LOOK FORWARD TO THAT. NO! I WANTED HIM TO GO DOWN IN NOVEMBER, I WANTED HIM TO LOSE. I KNOW. THAT'S GOING TO BE A HUGE PART OF THIS STORY AS WE BREAK IT DOWN, WHY HE IS LEAVING IN THE FIRST PLACE, AND PART OF THE REASON IS BECAUSE OF THE JUSTICE DEMOCRATS. I'D SAY IT'S A PRETTY HEALTHY PART OF THE REASON. AS I WILL EXPLAIN IN A BIT, IT'S ABOUT 80% OF THE REASON WHY. I ACTUALLY THINK IT'S THE OVERWHELMING REASON WHY HE'S LEAVING, AND I SAY JUSTICE DEMOCRATS BECAUSE RANDY BRYCE, HIS DEMOCRATIC OPPONENT THERE, IS A DEMOCRAT, ALSO KNOWN AS IRON STACHE. I WAS GOING TO SAY, I DIDN'T RECOGNIZE THE LAST NAME, USE HIS REAL NAME. IRON STACHE CHASED HIM OUT WITH A CROWBAR. WE WILL EXPLAIN ALL THAT, FIRST JOHN WITH THE STORY AND WE WILL RANK THE REASONS HE'S LEAVING. AS CENK SAYS WE ARE GOING TO GIVE YOU THE REAL REASONS WHY HE STEPPED DOWN, BUT BEFORE WE GET TO THAT, HERE ARE REASONS HE DID NOT STEP DOWN, DELIVERED BY PAUL RYAN. THE JOB PROVIDES INCREDIBLE OPPORTUNITIES, BUT THE TRUTH IS, IT'S EASY FOR IT TO TAKE OVER EVERYTHING IN YOUR LIFE, AND YOU CAN'T JUST LET THAT HAPPEN. BECAUSE THERE ARE OTHER THINGS IN LIFE THAT CAN BE FLEETING AS WELL. NAMELY, YOUR TIME IS A HUSBAND AND A DAD, WHICH IS THE OTHER GREAT HONOR OF MY LIFE. THAT'S WHY TODAY I'M ANNOUNCING THAT THIS YEAR WILL BE MY LAST ONE AS A MEMBER OF THE HOUSE. TO BE CLEAR, I AM NOT RESIGNING, I INTENDS TO SERVE MY FULL TERM AS I WAS ELECTED. MY KIDS WEREN'T EVEN BORN WHEN I WAS ELECTED, OUR OLDEST WAS 13 YEARS OLD WHEN I BECAME SPEAKER, NOW ALL THREE OF OUR KIDS ARE TEENAGERS, AND ONE THING I'VE LEARNED ABOUT TEENAGERS IS, UM, THEIR IDEA OF AN IDEAL WEEKEND IS NOT NECESSARILY TO SPEND ALL OF THEIR TIME WITH THEIR PARENTS. WHAT I REALIZE IS IF I'M HERE FOR ONE MORE TERM, MY KIDS WILL ONLY HAVE EVER KNOWN ME AS A WEEKEND DAD. I JUST CAN'T LET THAT HAPPEN. SOME OF YOU KNOW MY STORY, MY DAD DIED WHEN I WAS 16, THE AGE MY DAUGHTER IS, AND I JUST DON'T WANT TO BE ONE OF THOSE PEOPLE LOOKING BACK ON MY LIFE THINKING I COULD HAVE SPENT MORE TIME WITH MY KIDS THINKING IF I SPEND ONE MORE TERM THEY WILL ONLY KNOW ME AS A WEEKEND FATHER. THAT'S A GOOD ONE. BECAUSE OF THE FAMILY. I'VE NEVER HEARD IT BEFORE. I WROTE DOWN FOUR PRINCIPAL REASONS WHY PAUL RYAN IS LEAVING, I FORGOT TO PUT FAMILY DOWN. THAT'S NOT WHY. AND HE WILL SOON GET A JOB AS A LOBBYIST OR AN "CONSULTANT" OR "ADVISOR" THAT WILL PAY HIM AN UNBELIEVABLE AMONG THE MONEY AND BECAUSE OF THAT HE WILL BE GOING BACK BETWEEN WASHINGTON AND NEW YORK FAIRLY OFTEN ANYWAY, BY THE WAY THAT JOKE ABOUT HIS TEENAGE KIDS, THEY DON'T REALLY WANT TO SPEND TIME WITH THEIR PARENTS, THAT'S ALSO FLAT. ON MY GOD, THAT WAS AWKWARD. IF EVERY LEGISLATOR THAT HAD TEENAGE KIDS LEFT TO SPEND TIME WITH THEIR TEENAGE KIDS WE WOULD HAVE NO ONE IN CONGRESS. THAT'S CRAZY, THAT'S NOT WHY. THEY SAY THAT EVERY SINGLE TIME. NO SERIOUS PRESS PERSON SHOULD EVER TAKE, OH, "I LEFT BECAUSE OF MY FAMILY" SERIOUSLY UNLESS IT'S AN INCREDIBLY SPECIFIC CASE LIKE SANDRA DAY O'CONNOR, HER HUSBAND HAD ALZHEIMER'S, SHE WANTED TO SPEND A CERTAIN PERIOD OF TIME BEFORE HE LOST RECOGNITION OF HER, ETC., THAT MAKES SENSE. THIS, I GOT TEENAGE KIDS WHO DON'T WANT TO SEE ME ANYWAY? WHAT? NO, THAT'S NOT WHY. JESUS. WOW. AS I SAID, THAT WAS A PACK OF LIES, HE HAD OTHERS, WE WON'T GO INTO THEM, BUT LET'S TALK ABOUT SOME REASONS HE MIGHT HAVE FELT LIKE NOW WAS A GOOD TIME TO TRANSITION OUT. AS A SEGUE INTO THIS, HERE IS WHAT HE SAYS ARE HIS BIGGEST ACCOMPLISHMENTS IN HIS TIME IN CONGRESS SO HE'S TALKING ABOUT PASSING TAX CUTS, AND PASSING THE MASSIVE SPENDING BILL, BECAUSE HE'S A DEFICIT HAWK, THAT'S HIS REPUTATION, AND YOU WILL BE SHOCKED TO FIND OUT THAT THE CBO IS NOW PROJECTING AS OF THIS WEEK THAT THE DEFICIT WILL REACH $1 TRILLION BY 2020, THAT HAPPENED IN RECORD TIME UNDER HIS WATCH WITH DONALD TRUMP. LET'S BREAK THOSE TWO THINGS DOWN. HE HAS RAISED $54 MILLION IN JUST THIS ELECTION CYCLE. NOT HIS CAREER, JUST THIS ELECTION CYCLE, AND WE HAVEN'T EVEN WARMED UP YET FOR THIS CYCLE. WHY IS THAT? BECAUSE HE WAS ABOUT TO PASS TRILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN TAX CUTS. HE'S THE SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE, AN INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT POSITION, HE GOES TO THE TOP REPUBLICAN DONORS AND SAYS GIMME, GIMME. THEN HE DOES IT OUT TO THE OTHER REPUBLICANS AND THAT'S WHY WHEN DONORS SAY YOU BETTER PASS THE TAX CUTS OR ELSE WE WON'T GIVE YOU ANY MORE MONEY, PAUL RYAN SAYS ALL THESE BRIBES WILL END IN A SECOND IF WE DON'T GIVE THEM WHAT THEY BRIBED US FOR. HE'S INCREDIBLY PROUD TO BE A WATER BOY, I TAKE MONEY FROM THE DONORS AND GIVE THEM TO THE OTHER WATER BOYS IN CONGRESS WHO ALL WORK FOR THESE DONORS, AND THEN THE DONORS GET TRILLIONS IN TAX CUTS. PAUL RYAN HIS WHOLE LIFE, HIS MAIN THING HE DIDN'T SAY TAX CUTS WAS HIS MAIN THING, HE SAID I WANT TO MAKE SURE I GET THE DEFICIT UNDER CONTROL, I CARE ABOUT A BALANCED BUDGET. THAT TAX CUT COST THE BUDGET $1.9 TRILLION. THAT'S A DEFICIT. I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT THE OVERALL COST OF THE PACKAGE, I'M TALKING ABOUT IT ADDED TO TRILLION DOLLARS TO THE DEFICIT. SO PAUL RYAN'S ENTIRE CAREER WAS BASED ON A LIE, A TWO TRILLION DOLLAR LIFE. WHEN PUSH CAME TO SHOVE HE DIDN'T CARE ABOUT THE DEFICIT AT ALL, ALL HE CARED ABOUT WAS, HOW DO I DELIVER FOR THE DONORS? AND THEN THE DEFENSE CONTRACTORS ARE A NICE SECOND THOUGHT. OH, BY THE WAY, ARE WE SAFE FROM CANADA INVADING, OR WHATEVER FANTASIES THEY HAVE IN THEIR HEADS. THE MEXICANS ARE COMING, LIKE THEY ARE GOING TO TAKE OVER THE COUNTRY. SHARIA LAW. TOTAL NONSENSE. NO, IT'S TO GET LOCKHEED MARTIN AND BOEING AND ALL THOSE COMPANIES UNGODLY SUMS OF MONEY BECAUSE THEY ARE HUGE DONORS TO THE REPUBLICAN PARTY. AND THAT'S WHAT HE'S QUOTE UNQUOTE PROUD OF. THEY WILL ALSO NEED LOBBYIST AS WELL, I DON'T KNOW IF I WOULD PUT THAT IN THE TOP FIVE OF THE INDUSTRIES HE WILL END UP REPRESENTING IN A YEAR OR SO, BUT IT'S POSSIBLE, MENTIONING IT ON YOUR WAY OUT MIGHT BE A WAY TO GET A JOB WORKING FOR LOCKHEED OR ONE OF THOSE COMPANIES. NOW, AS TO HOW LONG AGO PEOPLE THOUGHT HE MIGHT BE LEAVING, THIS CAME OUT SO HE DOESN'T WANT TO BE INVOLVED IN THAT, NECESSARILY. AND THERE ARE SOME RELATED ISSUES TO THAT I THINK AS WELL, BUT A LOT OF THAT TURNED OUT TO BE TRUE, AND WHAT IS INTERESTING IS POLITICIANS ARE SO DISHONEST. LIKE, ARE YOU GOING TO RUN FOR SOMETHING? NO, I'M NOT GOING TO RUN FOR THAT, I'M HAPPY SERVING IN THE OFFICE I'M IN. ARE YOU GOING TO BE STEPPING DOWN? NO, DEFINITELY NOT. WESTERN TO A VIDEO JAYAR CUT FROM A COUPLE MONTHS AGO WHEN POLITICO REPORTED PEOPLE WERE SAYING HE WOULD BE STEPPING OUT, THIS IS HIS RESPONSE. THAT'S WHAT SURPRISES ME, THAT'S WHY I THOUGHT IT WAS AN IRRESPONSIBLE PIECE. THE IDEA THAT AFTER PASSING TAX REFORM, AS IF THAT THE ONLY THING I CARE ABOUT, I'M JUST GOING TO GET UP AND GO? IT'S RIDICULOUS, IT NEVER ENTERED MY MIND, LET ALONE DISCUSSED IT WITH ANYBODY, SO I REALLY SEE THIS AS SORT OF RANK SPECULATION ON THE DC BELTWAY PRESS SPECULATING THESE THINGS. I THINK IT WAS FAIRLY IRRESPONSIBLE SPECULATION, IT'S FAULTY SPECULATION, I'M NOT GOING TO GET UP AND LEAVE THIS CONGRESS IN THE MIDDLE OF THE TERM. THERE'S A LOT OF WORK TO DO, THAT'S WHY I'M NOT GOING ANYWHERE SOON. HE SAYS I'M NOT GOING TO PASS TAX REFORM AND JUST LEAVE, WHY ARE YOU ENGAGING IN RANK SPECULATION? HE DIDN'T SAY FAKE NEWS BUT HE WAS THINKING IT. AND THEN WITHIN A MONTH THEY PASS THE TAX LEGISLATION AND TWO MONTHS LATER HE STEPS DOWN. WHAT DID I TELL YOU? THE ONLY THING THEY CARED ABOUT WAS TAX CUTS FOR THE RICH, THAT WAS THEIR ONLY PRIORITY. SO YES, WHEN YOU GET INTO SPECIFIC SUBSIDIES FOR THE DIFFERENT INDUSTRIES, SURE, WONDERFUL, I GET SPECIFIC THE REGULATION FOR CERTAIN INDUSTRIES, YOU MAKE MORE MONEY POLLUTING RIVERS AND WATERS, GREAT, BUT THE TAX CUTS, THE TRILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN THE GOODIES, THAT WAS THE BIG TREASURE CHEST. THEY GOT THAT. NONE OF THEM CARE ANYMORE. AND I SAID THIS FROM DAY ONE, THE MOMENT TRUMP TOOK OFFICE, I SAID THERE OVERWHELMING PRIORITY WILL BE TAX CUTS, THEN THEY CAN IMPEACH HIM, DO WHATEVER THEY WANT WITH HIM, IT DOESN'T MATTER, THE ONLY THING THAT MATTERS IS TAX CUTS. OKAY. SO WHY IS PAUL RYAN ACTUALLY LEAVING? THERE ARE FOUR REASONS WHY. TO THE CREDIT OF THE MAINSTREAM PRESS, THEY DON'T REALLY GIVE A LOT OF TIME TO THE FAMILY REASON, THEY ALSO IGNORE THAT, THEY DON'T DISMISS IT LIKE I DO, BUT THEY IGNORE IT. NUMBER FOUR IS THE ONE THEY TALK ABOUT THE MOST, THIS CIVIL WAR WITHIN THE REPUBLICAN PARTY, CONSERVATIVES PRESSURING HIM, FRUSTRATING HIM, THE FREEDOM CAUCUS, IT'S A TOUGH JOB AND WHO WOULD REALLY WANT THIS JOB? GO READ ANY ARTICLE IN THE MAINSTREAM PRESS, THEY SPEND 80% OF THEIR TIME TALKING ABOUT THAT. THAT IS NOT THE REAL ISSUE, THAT IS ABOUT 2% OF HIS CONSIDERATION. ALL THESE THINGS ARE TOUGH JOB STOPPING POLITICIANS LOVE POWER. THEY AREN'T LIKE, GOLLY GEE, I'VE BEEN PRESSED A LITTLE BIT, THIS IS A TOUGH JOB, I HAVE TO GO. THAT'S NOT HOW IT WORKS. IT'S NOT TO SAY IT'S NOT A CONSIDERATION BUT IT'S A TINY CONSIDERATION. THAT'S REASON NUMBER FOUR. REASON NUMBER THREE IS CASHING IN. YOU THINK THAT MIGHT BE REASON NUMBER ONE, BUT HE'S ONLY 48, HE'S GOT A LOT OF YEARS TO CASH IN. AND THESE GUYS HAVE TROUBLE LETTING GO OF POWER. BUT HE'S GOING TO LEAVE AND HE'S GOING TO MAKE AN UNREAL AMOUNT OF MONEY. SO WHEN HE TALKS ABOUT HIS FAMILY AND TAKING CARE OF HIS FAMILY, THAT'S ACTUALLY WHAT HE'S TALKING ABOUT. LIKE, I'M GOING TO MAKE SO MUCH MONEY. THE KIDS ARE TEENAGERS, THEY ARE GOING TO COLLEGE SOON, I'VE GOT TO MAKE SOME SERIOUS MOOLAH HERE. BECAUSE HE'S GOING TO GO BACK INTO GOVERNMENT. THIS IS A REVOLVING DOOR. CENK, HE LITERALLY SAID TODAY HE'S NOT GOING TO RUN AGAIN. SURE, SURE. SO YOU HAVE JUST BEEN PROVEN WRONG, WE SHOULD HAVE BET. OKAY, SO THERE ARE RUMORS ON WHETHER HIS WANT TO CHALLENGE MIKE PENCE FOR THE NOMINATION IN 2020 WHEN THEY ASSUME TRUMP WON'T BE THERE ANYMORE, THOSE ARE AMONG THE SPECULATIONS, SOME SAY 2024, SOMETHING OTHER POSTS, BUT WHAT DO YOU DO? THIS IS THE M.O. OF ALMOST ALL POLITICIANS ESPECIALLY IF THEY ARE THE AGE OF PAUL RYAN, YOU CASH IN AND MAKE MILLIONS AND THEN YOU COME BACK INTO GOVERNMENT, WORST CASE SCENARIO IS A CABINET SECRETARY OR SOMETHING, AND LIKE SCOTT PRUITT YOU SAY THANK YOU TO THE INDUSTRY THAT MAYBE ALL THIS MONEY, AND I WILL DESTROY ALL REGULATIONS OF IT. REASON NUMBER TWO IS HE DOESN'T WANT ANY PART OF TRUMP, BECAUSE TRUMP IS GOING TO PUT HIM IN AN IMPOSSIBLE SITUATION. HE'S NOT GETTING OUT BEFORE THE NEXT CONGRESS, AS HE STATED, HE'S GETTING OUT BEFORE IMPEACHMENT. THAT'S WHAT HE THINKS, BUT HE'S NOT GOING TO MAKE IT. I THINK WHATEVER IS WANT TO HAPPEN WITH TRUMP WILL HAPPEN BEFORE THE MIDTERMS, AND HENCE BEFORE HE RETIRES, SO CHAFFETZ MADE THE RIGHT MOVE, GET OUT RIGHT NOW. IN FACT PAUL RYAN, FUN PREDICTION, IF IT SOUNDS LIKE IT'S GOOD TO HEAD TOWARD IMPEACHMENT AND A TOTAL BLOWOUT, MIGHT PULL THE CHUTE LIKE CHAFFETZ DID AND SAY I MEANT AT THE END OF MY TERM, BUT GOSH, TEENAGERS, GOTTA RUN. SOMEONE JUST TURNED 13, I'VE GOT TO GO. BECAUSE IF THEY ARE GOING TO DO IMPEACHMENT HE'S BETWEEN A ROCK AND A HARD PLACE, HE SAID ALL ALONG INCLUDING TODAY LET MUELLER DO HIS JOB, THE RULE OF LAW IN THIS COUNTRY IS IMPORTANT. THERE'S A REPUBLICAN CONGRESSMAN OFF THE RECORD TALKING TO ERICK ERICKSON TODAY ABOUT HOW WE ALL KNOW TRUMP IS AN IDIOT AND WE WOULD IMPEACH HIM IF HE COULD, IF IT COMES TO IT, IF HE FIRES MUELLER. NOW IF YOU GO TO IMPEACHMENT, THE SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE ABOUT AS RELEVANT A HUMAN BEING AS THERE IS ON THE PLANET. SO THAT IF HE BETRAYS TRUMP, THOSE REPUBLICAN VOTERS THAT ARE THE BASE OF TRUMP AND THE BASE OF THE NEW REPUBLICAN PARTY WILL HATE HIM FOREVER AND HE WILL NEVER GET REELECTED TO ANYTHING AGAIN IF HE GOES FOR IMPEACHMENT. IF HE DOESN'T GO FOR IMPEACHMENT, THAT'S THE MOST CRAVEN, RIDICULOUS THING IF TRUMP DID ALMOST THINGS, ETC. SO ALL OF HIS EITHER YOU LOSE ANY KIND OF SEMBLANCE OF BEING A SERIOUS PERSON. A SERIOUS PERSON WHO CARES ABOUT THE COUNTRY AND THE CONSTITUTION, ETC., YOU ARE SCREWED IF YOU ARE CAUGHT IN THAT TRAP. JESUS, THAT'S REASON NUMBER TWO? WHAT IS REASON NUMBER ONE? HE'S IN A DISTRICT THAT'S ONLY +5 REPUBLICAN, THEY JUST LOST A DISTRICT WHERE THEY WERE +19, THEY LOST ANYWAY. IN A +5 DISTRICT IN WISCONSIN, WISCONSIN, WHERE WE JUST HAD TWO ENORMOUS UPSETS, ONE THAT THE GOVERNOR SCOTT WALKER SAID WAS A HUGE RED FLAG FOR ALL REPUBLICANS ACROSS THE COUNTRY, AND ANOTHER ONE IN A JUDGE VACANCY WHERE ANOTHER SHOCKING VICTORY, BIG VICTORY FOR PROGRESSIVES, WISCONSIN IS GOING BLUE WAVE BIG TIME. SCOTT WALKER, THE GOVERNOR, IS LIKE, HELP, I NEED MORE MONEY, WE'RE DYING OUT HERE. FRANK LUNTZ, THE TOP REPUBLICAN POLLSTER, SAYS YOU DON'T GET IT, IT'S A TSUNAMI, THE HOUSE AND THE SENATE ARE GOING. WHETHER YOU BELIEVE THAT OR NOT, JOHN, THAT'S WHAT THE TOP REPUBLICAN POSTERS ARE SAYING, THAT'S WHAT ALL THE POLLS SAY. THAT'S WHAT SABADO IS SAYING. ANTONIO SABATO, JR.? NO. IF YOU ARE IN A +5 DISTRICT AND YOUR OPPONENT, RANDY BRYCE, HAS RAISED 2 MILLION IN JUST THE LAST QUARTER, AND SMALL DONATIONS, HE'S A JUSTICE DEMOCRAT, HE DOESN'T TAKE CORPORATE PAC MONEY, RANDY BRYCE IS COMING WITH A BLOWTORCH, YOU ARE IN A +5 DISTRICT. IF YOU AS THE SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE LOSE YOUR OWN SEAT YOU ARE HUMILIATED. IT WOULD BE LITERALLY AN UNPRECEDENTED LOSS. IT WOULD BE A HISTORIC LOSS. AND RIGHT NOW DASCHLE? THAT WAS THE SENATE, BUT A DASCHLE-LIKE LOSS, THAT'S RIGHT. SO RIGHT NOW HE'S LOOKING AT THE PRECIPICE, HE'S GOT TO GO. ARE YOU INSANE? WHY ARE WE HAVING A CONVERSATION ABOUT REPUBLICAN CIVIL WARS AND FAMILIES AND ALL THAT NONSENSE? HE HAS TO LEAVE BECAUSE HE HAS AT MINIMUM OF 50% CHANCE OF BEING HUMILIATED AND RUN OUT OF TOWN, TARRED AND FEATHERED. THAT'S WHY HE'S RESIGNING. AND BY THE WAY, RANDY BRYCE HAS A LOT OF SUPPORTERS AND A LOT OF HEALTH, A LOT OF GROUPS BACKING HIM, GREAT, STRONG PROGRESSIVE GROUPS, ETC., AND HE'S ALSO JUSTICE DEMOCRAT. SO I'M NOT SAYING JUSTICE DEMOCRATS ARE THE ONLY PEOPLE TO GET CREDIT, NOT REMOTELY. ALL THOSE GROUPS SHOULD GET CREDIT FOR ALL THE HELP THEY HAVE GIVEN, PCCC, ETC., TO RANDY BRYCE. BUT I REMEMBER WHEN JUSTICE DEMOCRATS STARTED, THE IDEA THAT THEY WOULD EVEN GET ONE DEMOCRAT IN CONGRESS WAS FUNNY. DEEPLY PROGRESSIVE CANDIDATES WHO DON'T TAKE ANY CORPORATE PAC MONEY? MAYBE YOU WILL GET ONE BY ACCIDENT. IT LOOKS LIKE A JUSTICE DEMOCRAT BACKED CANDIDATE IS ABOUT TO TAKE THE SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE'S JOB. WHAT NOW? BY THE WAY, WE WILL HAVE THE LINKS DOWN BELOW TO HELP RANDY BRYCE TAKE THAT SEAT, DON'T TAKE ANYTHING FOR GRANTED, AND LINKS TO JUSTICE DEMOCRATS AS WELL.
