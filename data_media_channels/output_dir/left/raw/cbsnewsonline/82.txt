00:04:01,507 --> 00:04:02,709
SELFISHNESS, GREED, AND 

4
00:04:02,709 --> 00:04:03,042

THIS GOOD NEWS IS NOT EASY. 

23
00:05:03,269 --> 00:05:04,070
YET THE CHALLENGES THAT

25
00:05:45,745 --> 00:05:49,482
THEY WERE DUE TO A HUMBLING 

26
00:05:49,482 --> 00:05:50,516
CONNECTION TO THE HOLY SPIRIT. 

27
00:05:50,516 --> 00:05:52,050
IT WAS THERE DAILY WITNESS OF 

28
00:05:52,050 --> 00:05:54,821

33
00:06:11,804 --> 00:06:12,705
THAT WITNESS REMAINS A 

34
00:06:12,705 --> 00:06:13,973
PERENNIAL SOURCE OF SPIRITUAL 

35
00:06:13,973 --> 00:06:16,209
AND MISSIONARY RENEWAL FOR 

36
00:06:16,209 --> 00:06:27,086
GOD'S HOLY AND FAITHFUL PEOPLE. 

37
00:06:27,086 --> 00:06:28,554
OF COURSE, THERE WILL ALWAYS BE 

38
00:06:28,554 --> 00:06:30,423
PEOPLE WHO RESIST THE GOOD NEWS 

39
00:06:30,423 --> 00:06:37,897

43
00:06:47,140 --> 00:06:48,474
MAY WE NEVER BE SWAYED OR 

44
00:06:48,474 --> 00:06:50,309
DISCOURAGED BY THE ICY STARE OF 

45
00:06:50,309 --> 00:06:53,179
INDIFFERENCE OR THE STORMY 

46
00:06:53,179 --> 00:07:01,687
WINDS OF HOSTILITY. 

47
00:07:01,687 --> 00:07:04,957
BUT LET US ALSO HUMBLY 

48
00:07:04,957 --> 00:07:06,158
ACKNOWLEDGE THAT IF WE ARE 

49
00:07:06,158 --> 00:07:08,261
HONEST WITH OURSELVES, WE CAN 

50
00:07:08,261 --> 00:07:10,930

DISAPPOINTMENT, REJECTION, OR 

59
00:07:31,183 --> 00:07:33,953
BETRAYAL. 

60
00:07:33,953 --> 00:07:35,854

REPUBLICANS TO DECLARE AMERICA 

314
00:22:06,124 --> 00:22:07,191

HE WAS THE DECIDING VOTE THAT 

343
00:22:52,070 --> 00:22:57,275
KILLED THE NEW PRESIDENT'S PLAN 

344
00:22:57,275 --> 00:22:58,176
