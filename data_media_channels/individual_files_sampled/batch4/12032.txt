in private schools and my son went and saw it and he said you know dad it's not that good and I said it's junior and senior year it's the best movie ever made so you ever see The Truman Show has anybody seen that with Jim Carrey yeah for those that haven't seen it very briefly Jim Carrey plays a guy named Truman whose whole life from birth is a reality TV show and so he lives in this town that he thinks but he doesn't know it's he lives in this town he thinks his real life and it's actually a TV set he's got all these friends and a wife and they're all actors just playing people and it's a a profitable show it's got a lot of sponsors so they got to keep it on the air but the only way they can keep it on the air is by keeping Truman from finding out that he's in a fake world and so the way they do this is they teach him to be afraid from the day's a baby till he grows up so they say like don't go over that bridge Truman because it's really dangerous don't go down that road you know don't go into the water don't even go on vacation because terrible things happen too I feel that this has become a perfect metaphor for the left in America it they are taught at your age to be afraid of any idea they disagree with you know don't listen to that idea Truman it's fascist don't listen to the idea it's white supremacist don't listen to that idea it so you don't war on women or whatever it is it's like training people to ignorance it's training people to ignorance it's keeping you the only way you can become wise over time is to listen to people who you disagree with now we on the right have an advantage which is that the Left owns the means of communication so we're constantly listening to what they have to say and the worst that what's the worst thing that happens to you maybe they convince you on a point or maybe you sharpen your argument against them and you become better your beliefs become more sound so what I really want to talk about I'm going to talk about Hollywood because I have a lot of experience in this it is pretty funny out there I'm gonna talk about but I want to just put it in a larger context talking about what the left that calls the narrative and the narrative is a real thing I mean the narrative is kind of the atmosphere we breathe sometimes they call it the Overton Window they call it the Overton Window is the things you're allowed to think and discuss what is reasonable to believe and it affects you without without your knowing it I mean we all we all are part of it the story I always like to tell about the narrative and how powerful it is about George Washington who if you you ever read he was a president it if you ever read about him he was a man of extraordinary virtue I mean he was an unbelievable human being who gave up a kingdom he gave away a kingdom because he believed believed in Liberty he ended the Revolutionary War with an army at his back they would have followed him into hell they had followed him into hell they were ready to promote him to be the king that people wanted him to be King instead he marched to the Capitol handed his sword to the civil authorities to the Congress as a symbol that this was going to be a free country when King George the 3rd heard that he was just going to go home he said if he does that he will be the greatest man in the world and he was he was an amazingly virtuous guy who believed in Liberty your Liberty comes from his virtue George Washington could not understand swear this is true he could not fathom why his slaves didn't work as hard on the land as he did he just couldn't figure it out he would complain about it all the time he said I work hard how are you gonna get anything out of the bland if you don't work hard why don't they work hard he had a slave named owner judge who was his wife Martha's home slave basically and they treated her really well really respectfully and they kind of put her made her part of the family she escaped he couldn't figure out why George Washington the father of Liberty the guy who basically invented modern Liberty could not figure out why she would escape you thought she must have been seduced you know some guy must have seduced her that's the narrative that's what the narrative does to the best of men to the best of people I mean why which Washington was but just to add this is off this topic but George Washington did figure it out by the end of his life and he did freeze the only slave holding founder who let his slaves go he freed them but that's the grip that narrative has and I think it it it hasn't changed at all I mean it hasn't changed at all for me I I think about abortion I think about the fact that 3,000 babies are aborted every day and we're sitting here we're talking even we if even those of us who feel that this is wrong don't really feel what is happening because of the narrative because the narrative has been has deadened our feelings about it and I know many people feel passionately on you know pro-abortion I know many of them I know many women who have had abortions but but within my lifetime which like it's like twenty minutes probably within my lifetime they'll invent wombs outside the womb you know non-natural wombs where you'll be able to see babies growing at that point at that point the same people who tear down statues of robert e lee because he couldn't step outside the narrative are going to be tearing down statues of us because they're gonna call the savages they're not gonna care that we invented the iphone they're gonna say look this is what you did and that's the narrative and it affects all of us so my concern is the fact that the left owns the narrative I'm a freedom guy I just want people to be free I want people to do whatever they want I know if I'm free you got to be free right but the left owns the narrative I here's my my quick resume I was a newspaper man I was a radio news man I became a novelist of best-selling novelist and I became a Hollywood screenwriter I've worked in the narrative business all my life I know how narrative is made and and I know what it does to people and how it controls people and I'm genuinely concerned genuinely concerned about the fact that the left owns the narrative and we on the right don't care we do not care I used to make speeches begging going to think tanks I used to beg them you know put your instead of putting a million dollars into a congressional race put it into a TV show put it into a movie by a women's magazine every women's magazine is is left-wing every comedian on TV in the news especially before I get to Hollywood let me just talk a little bit about the news because 7% you know people talk about Fox News all the time Fox News has 1/10 the viewership of the network's seven percent of journalists identify as Republicans 28% identify as Democrats the rest are lying and are Democrats I I have been in many many newsrooms they're all Democrats now I don't know if you've ever heard of the availability heuristic this is important for establishing narrative the availability heuristic is this is sometimes they just call it availability bias your picture of life your picture of what's happening in life naturally comes from those ideas that are most available to you right the ones that are easy to imagine and the ones you're confronted with most of the time this really affects us it really affects us big time so for instance the other day Tuesday a plane blew out an engine and a woman was killed brave woman pilot landed the plane whenever there's a plane crash you hear about it all day long and people are afraid to fly I know plenty of people who were afraid to get on a plane and everybody's a little nervous when they get on a plane people I've been in hurricanes on a plane and people start screaming and panicking that was the first person to die on an airplane since 2009 in America an American airplane okay you are safe in an airplane you're not safe in a car 40,000 people a year die in cars what would happen if every time somebody died in a car they reported it the way they report an airplane crash right you'd never get in a car because it would be happening every minute same thing with nuclear power they're shutting down nuclear power plants in Europe they're shutting him down the cleanest most efficient form of energy we have do you know that outside of Chernobyl in Russia where they couldn't do anything right nobody's ever died in a nuclear accident in Japan they had a they had a hurricane earthquake and a tsunami broke their nuclear power plant still nobody died they still nobody died from the nuclear radiation it's pretty safe stuff but anytime it happens anytime there's a leak it's horrific right so it's horrific so that's the way the availability heuristic works then you have a news industry dominated by Democrats now when when some when people are all together and they all believe the same stuff like maybe maybe the people in this room I don't know maybe there are people who disagree with me here and I hope if there are I hope you'll stay and ask questions afterwards because I'd like to talk to you when people agree with each other they become a little bit more radicalized when there's nobody to say you know that idea is going a little too far you know you might want to dial that back a little when there's nobody say you know that's that's that's really not true here are some facts you start to kind of reel off a little bit you know people who believe that America is racist vote for Democrats I think 78% of Democrats believe America is racist so you got Democrats running the news industry and you've got your mind shaped by the ideas that are available to you so let's talk about Starbucks okay couple days ago two guys walk into Starbucks and the lady there who's the manager who is a social justice warrior with buttons on her head you know I don't know why they always have to have more than one button more than one bumper sticker you know you know one you get one bumper sticker you know you don't need 15 bumper sticker she asked the two to leave because they're not buying anything they want to use the bathroom they refused to leave she calls the police the police come in the police asked them to leave and they refused to leave again okay and they're black and the police arrested they don't charge them with anything but they just take him out in cuffs just gets on the video the video goes viral protests begin people start threatening a boycott 8,000 Starbucks have now shut down so that people can be trained in what in what you know not throwing guys out when they use the bathroom without buying sighs you know I'm not sure is that a racial incident is it a new story I I would say that is not a new story there are 300 million people in this country when two guys refused to leave a Starbucks and get thrown out I'm sorry I am NOT sending the press that is not a story but but it is very hard to get when you talk to a leftist about racism and you tell them listen I'm gonna tell you something this is stone true I don't care what color you are I I do not care I don't care who you sleep with I really don't I am going to tell you your generation is gonna colonize Mars the last thing that you have to worry about is racism like I'm the oldest guy in this room that's living in the past that is living the if you are worried about I lived overseas a long time seven years this is the least racist country you want to prove it go look at a street sign a street scene of New York City then look at the street scene of Riyadh then look at the street scene of Shanghai or anywhere you know Beijing and anywhere you like this is the only place this is the only place where we look like the mutts we are okay where we all look different so it's not a racist country I don't believe it is I mean I don't believe it is but but how can you help but think it is when they cover stories like that and they cover it in that way and they basically let people play the press because the people playing the press are the same people reporting the stories and it gets violent when when Michael Brown was shot and they pushed that narrative that turned out to be untrue that he had his hands up and was saying don't shoot there were riots nobody has ever held the press to account for that Eric Holder's Justice Department found that that story wasn't true Eric Holder and Barack Obama's Justice Department that sort was no never true but nobody ever was held to account so now let's get the Hollywood and wife stupid I don't even know if they think you're super you know you know I once said to an agent in New York a book agent in New York you know she was arranging the publication my book and I said you know I think I can get on a brilliant woman by the way one of the best agents I ever worked with as smart as a whip I mean she just knew everything there was every time I talk to her I learn something about my own business and I said to her one day you know I think I can get on Hannity and she said who's Kennedy they I don't think Hollywood actually knows you're here so let's talk about what Hollywood does with the narrative that they get from their fellow Democrats and obviously you know Hollywood is a big Democrat city you watch the Oscars you heard him I I could tell you I could stand here for the rest of this time I'm here and just tell your stories about it but well I'll tell you a couple anyway you know like you when you walk in to sell a story in Hollywood which I've done a lot and it's very hard you know you're the odds are always against you you walk in and you make conversation and the conversation frequently starts with isn't George W Bush an idiot isn't Donald Trump the worst person who ever lived right and you're there to sell something and there's 15 other guys out there who are younger you know smarter better-looking than you who want to sell their thing and if you're a bigmouth like me you have to say you have to say you know I'm on the other side of this question and it's like don't let the door hit you on the way out like they throw you out so that's how Democrats liberals in Hollywood are so bold that I had a friend call up a showrunner got the showrunner is a guy who runs a TV show right there's most important person on the TV set she called up a showrunner with an idea she said I want to pitch you idea she said the showrunner said great I'm on my way to a Hilary fundraiser I'll pick you up on the way and you can pitch it to me so that's how bold they are we conservatives I swear this is true we had an organization that was secret it was called Friends of Abe the first rule is like Fight Club the first rule of Friends of a beauty could intok about Friends of Abe it was conservatives in Hollywood you know why we called it Friends of Abe because in the old days when it was would cost your job to be gay they used to call gay people friends of Dorothy like Dorothy and The Wizard of Oz so they would say Rock Hudson is he friend of Dorothy you know so we were friends of Abe Lincoln because you admitted you were a conservative so what did the conservative meeting look like in Hollywood a conservative meaning look like Nollywood get that we'd all sit around a lunch table and somebody would make a speech you know usually Gary Sinise and by the way the organization doesn't exist anymore if it did I would have to kill you after telling you this somebody would make a speech you know like Gary Sinise or you know once um there's like five big actors there and then they go around the table and each person would stand up and it was like an Alcoholics Anonymous meeting you know that people send out my name is Andrew I'm a conservative hi Andrew you know and you tell stories about what it was like to be a conservative in Hollywood the result of this okay now it's not that there are no conservative movies made that is not true I mean if you watch Christopher Nolan movies he's an obvious conservative The Dark Knight stories are obviously conservative stories all almost all conservative stories of fantasies and almost and and the the left what the left does is they solidify the narrative made in the news in his storica films they do this over and over again here's a story from my childhood when I was 10 the President of the United States was murdered right John F Kennedy John F Kennedy was a staunch anti-communist cold warrior right Democrat but he said we would bear any burden to defend freedom he was going to attack the Soviet you he was killed by a communist Lee Harvey Oswald that's who killed him it has now been established really beyond a shadow of a doubt the man who killed him was a guy who had he was nuts but he had effect tried to defect to the Soviet Union he was so crazy even they didn't want him you know they thought were like we're we're crazy we're communists but we're not that crazy they sent him back he was afraid Kennedy was going to overturn the Castro's cast the Castro regime in Cuba so he shot John F Kennedy the day Oswald was arrested the New York Times which at the time was a newspaper New York Times ran a front-page story talking about Lee Harvey Oswald right and the fact that he and and it ran a front-page story by a famous writer famous at the time in James Reston on the front page an op-ed it said hate kill John F Kennedy hate kill John F Kennedy what did that mean it meant the southern racists who did hate John F Kennedy because of his civil rights initiatives all Democrats by the way they that their hate had killed John F Kennedy now they were hateful they were racists and they were Democrats but but they didn't kill John F Kennedy okay they just didn't do it it's like he was killed by so and because the left was sympathetic to the Soviets they didn't want to report the story and this spun out into the famous John F Kennedy conspiracy right who killed Kennedy this went on for all of my adult life who killed Kennedy you know it was some conspiracy and finally in the 90s Oliver Stone a terrific director made a movie called JFK anybody seen JFK okay a couple not a couple people Kevin Costner plays a crusading da is a true story who puts on trial a massive conspiracy of conservatives who who killed John F Kennedy because he was trying to pull out of Vietnam and so they that so the Conservatives killed him and Kevin Costner's the hero putting forward this case now in real life the jury I think took under an hour to dump this case it was such a crazy stupid case right but in the movie Costner's the hero that's the story right this happens again and again and again Argo the Ben Affleck picture that just won the Oscar but like three four years ago five years ago was the story of the Iranian hostage crisis Jimmy Carter who mishandled that crisis from beginning to end such that people you know soldiers were dying in rescue missions people were quitting it was his fault that had happened to begin I mean obviously it was the hostage takers fault but it was his fault that the place erupted he's edited out of the story except in this noble role so Jimmy Carter is the noble hero the noble president in Argo they continually solidify this narrative one of the reasons my Hollywood career kind of got nailed was during the war on terror one film after another one film after another was made saying that when our soldiers were rapists our soldiers were killers that was the Valley of Elah and remember he comes home and he's a he's he's so upset by having been in Iraq that he starts killing people they were fools Lions for lambs with Tom Cruise that was where these the Republicans were manipulating wanted a war to manipulate the press and so they sent these poor foolish patriotic clowns off to war and they got killed one movie after another and I started to protest I started to write pieces about it because I didn't care whether they were for or against the war but I thought it was wrong to make anti-war propaganda while the soldiers were in the field that had never happened before so I started writing about it and of course now hard to get a job after that but but it was worthwhile so they're making one picture like this after another every one of them bombed every one of them bombed and so variety which is our trade paper the show business trade papers started to write pieces saying no people just don't want to see movies about the war on terror I mean that's how wrapped up in their narrative they are people don't want to see movies about the war on terror and then Clint Eastwood made American sniper and it became one of the biggest grossing r-rated films in history and they said gee that's that's strange you know why why did people go to this picture well it's because American soldiers weren't portrayed as rapists and killers and madmen when in fact our enemy were the bad guys we can be against the war but we weren't the bad guys right we might not maybe we shouldn't have been there but we weren't the bad guys and that's all American sniper showed and people showed up for it in droves so who cares okay the other day Donald Trump pardoned a guy named Scooter Libby and I'm not gonna go into the story cuz it's so long and boring but just in case you don't know before there was Donald Trump there was George W before Donald Trump was the worst person on earth Mitt Romney was the worst person on earth before Mitt Romney was the worst person on earth George W Bush was the worst person on earth I mean it was real it was not I'm not kidding around I mean this guy you know George W Bush may be not the brightest light in the chandelier but but not a bad man I mean a good man trying to do his best and he they just hated him and they went after him with everything they got guy named Joseph Wilson wrote an editorial after we went into Iraq claiming Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction which everybody said all our intelligence said that all the Democrats said it John Kerry Hillary Clinton Nancy Pelosi they all called for Sodom who's saying to be overthrown so we went in overthrew Sodom saying couldn't find the weapons of mass destruction and suddenly everybody was going at Bush he lied to us he lied he didn't lie those he had the same intelligence as everybody else so Joseph Wilson wrote this piece saying Saddam Hussein didn't have weapons it was debunked while they were debunking it they a journalist named Novak exposed the fact that Wilson's wife was a CIA agent he used to introduce her as my CIA agent wife okay so it wasn't a big secret but he that became the scandal same way as Russian collusion Russia collusion became the scandal after Trump was elected instead of the emails suddenly that became the scandal Valerie Plame was exposed oh my god special counsel just like now special counsel was appointed big investigation they found out it had nothing to do with Bush nothing to do with Cheney was all ridiculous but one guy this guy Scooter Libby Libby got caught telling two different stories to the FBI and was convicted and that's the guy he pardoned they made a movie about this called fair game right I'm sure you all seen fair game I think it's make me the lowest rated movie ever made except for mine in which Valerie Plame is suddenly a CIA hero and Dick Cheney and George W Bush are conspiring against her and they said to Joseph Wilson let me see I wrote down the quote let me see if I can find it they they said to Joseph Wilson nobody's gonna go see this movie you know nobody's gonna talk about it and Joseph Wilson said for people who have short memories or don't read this is the only way they will remember the period life is short art is long art lasts forever movies will be out there forever you one night at 3 o'clock in the morning will be channel surfing and you will see JFK on TV and if you don't know any better that's good what you think the story is going to be they own the narrative they own the narrative we are all living in Truman's world ok and the last way I want to talk about the the last part about the narrative I want to talk about is simply language and this is something I have studied my whole life the way people use language and the way they abused language and the universities I feel are the core of this problem and the generators of this problem the left has become unbelievable at using language to demonize normal human life ok we use phrases and we do it all the time we pick up their phrases and we argue about them like the objectification of women what is the objectification of women mean it means men like to look at women men like to look at pretty women everybody who is in this room is in this room today because men like to look at pretty women that's how you got here if anybody's shocked I'm sorry and don't report me now are some men louts yes - some men misuse their you know of a power and their sexuality of course this is the world right people are bad bad people are not nice but to say that the fact that men admire beauty and women is something inherently toxic inherently wrong is essentially to condemn the human condition you know it's essentially to condemn something that actually is beautiful something that actually is one of the main sources of comfort and joy for both men and women and to make us feel like we have to second-guess it all the time you know you could be talking about manners you could be talking about abuse of power you could be talking about respect but instead to be talking about the objectification of women is simply to toxify normal human life another one racial profiling you're a cop really I mean you're a TSA agent and a young Muslim male comes up down your line now here's the thing you are going to pay more attention to that guy you have to why not not because he's guilty he's you know chances are huge that he's innocent but the chances the guy who's gonna blow up the plane looks like him that's police work that's how police work works right he's gonna it's really uncomfortable it's really horrible that he has to go through that but the alternative is the guy ends up searching Barbara Bush just to pretend that he's not going to search Mohammed right let's just ask him to lie let's just ask him to not live in the real world that's just creating Truman's world so that we don't have to live with the uncomfortable fact that we are dealing with a portion of humanity that produces most of the terrorists it's a real world it's the real world it's uncomfortable and by the way I really feel for people who get pulled over in neighborhoods where they the police think you know the police have that spider sense right they think like I that guy doesn't belong here I feel bad when people get pulled over but I feel much worse when people get robbed and killed and finally my favorite one is cultural appropriation cultural appropriation is the best thing about America cultural appropriation is one of the best inventions ever ok America when we talk about American exceptionalism people think that means America is the best it doesn't it doesn't it means America is different every other country is invented was invented on a racial basis every single other one France is France because the Franks live there Germany is Germany because the Germans tribes live there English England is England because the angles lived here only this country was invented on an idea a Creed it's a cradle country come into our country legally adopt our Creed bring the spaghetti that's it that's it dot you know anybody can be an American five minutes after you're here I lived in England for seven years I could have lived there 107 years I never would have been an Englishman but you get off the boat here you sign the card you adopt you swear to the Constitution you're an American you know we want we you owe us your food you owe us your funny hats we get to dress up and as you on Halloween and you get to be free it's a great deal with cultural appropriation I mean it's nuts it is absolutely nuts is I mean does anybody want to live in a city like this one that doesn't have a Chinese restaurant there was an entire article in The New York Times a woman complaining about Asian salad I thought if you are completed Asian salad is what you have to complain about you are living on the greatest country on earth you know this is great you're complaining about Asian salad all of these things derive I'll wrap up because I really want to talk to you about all of these things derive from a notion on the left that is actually their central notion which is there is no moral reality and so if you win the narrative you win the world this is why they shout at you and you know they say they say I the reason I left the country I was with at a dinner party with my wife in New York this is in the late 80s ninety-eight 1980s and I said many boys and girls because we were all young parents I said boys and girls are really different and the dinner party shut down and went silent because that was like a rude thing to say there was the first wave right and I walked out the restaurant I turned to my wife and I said we are leaving the country um I'm not gonna live in a country where I can't speak the simplest truth right the simplest truth that men and women are different so the reason they have to shut you down is because they think if you win the narrative you win reality I mean the reality doesn't even make sense because then they'll tell you that a man is a woman in a man's body and you think if there's no difference between men and women how do you know how do you even know you're a woman the man's body if men and women are entirely the same you know we just be like having a man in a man's body they have to shut you down because they think if they win the narrative they win reality now in order to believe this that there is no moral there is no morality you have to think like this I mean this is the thing they say you have to respect all cultures as a billboard in Hollywood says respect all cultures it's just like an ad for jeans or something like this they really respect all cultures by our genes and I think really don't have to have to respect all cultures I mean in the South before the Civil War they held slaves that was their culture I don't respect that culture in Germany they murdered human beings by the carload I got to respect that culture but I got no respect for that culture Saudi Arabia woman can't go out doors without asking her male relative for permission got no respect for that culture in order to believe what they believe there was a time way back right before America before the in the ancient world when every single human being on earth thought slavery was normal and right even the slaves they may have thought it was bad for them they may have thought they shouldn't be slaves but there was nobody walking the planet Earth at that moment who thought that slavery was a bad thing or that it should even be argued about it just was it just was were they right there was nobody to say they were wrong were they right I don't think they were I think every single human being on earth could be a Nazi and he'd still be in the wrong and I think the left thinks that too they just won't admit it so there is another narrative that's our narrative which is the narrative of the truth you know I don't I'm not one of these guys who believe that facts are everything I think the internal world is a beautiful beautiful thing beauty is in the eye of the beholder that the Jaguar would not be swift unless we had the word Swift in our mind the Jaguar doesn't know it it is only we know you know the inner world matters but you gotta align it with the real world and that's what stories are for and the fact that the Wright doesn't know how to tell stories and the fact that it doesn't care and the fact that it doesn't pay attention to the arts except to complain about them and censor them he's a problem for me you know so I'll just leave you with this the truth will set you free but you got to know how to tell it you've got to know how to tell the story thank you very much I appreciate it all right if you have your questions for mr. Clavin come and go ahead and line up on this side here and we'll do them one by one and Atilla mr. Clavin drops dead from exhaustion so that's the plan hi mr. Clavin my name is Yosh thank you so much for coming here and talking to us we really appreciate it so my question is that in a lot of the Indian community specifically a lot of immigrant communities you have notice a lot of people just buy into the narrative and you know like when I go and I tell people you know oh I'm Republican they're like shocked you know even at the voting stations ask what party are you for I see Republican use you know their whole face shifts and so a lot of times when I've tried you know changing the narrative or telling the story it takes a long time they have to get to know me they have to trust me they have to see me as a good person or knowledgeable before they can even take my ideas at face value so in your experience is there a way to tell the story in a quicker manner to get those things out quicker to change the narrative around people like us to make a change in our communities I tell you what I try it doesn't work all the time but I tell you what I try one of the things that we tend to do is we tend to hit people with facts facts facts facts you see Paul Ryan's standing in front of the board with his point you know he just kind of doze off but the real question is this which is your best life right which is the best life is your best life to be a victim to go up to people and say oh you hurt me and therefore you should give me a job you should give me money or is your best life to walk in tall and say I am the best there is you don't like me because of the color of my skin you're an idiot you know this is me I'm gonna beat you out at your game I when I listen to two white people talk about the plight of black people I think you know what you should do for black people compete with them make them raise their game make them be excellent that's the dignity of life that's where'd all the dignity and beauty and fun of life come from so what I would say is facts are great but people know these things inherently and if you tell them the true story of human lives of what a human life is they recognize it and you might try that instead hi I'm Alexandra I was wondering do you think that the strength of the leftist narrative is mostly a result of the sort of democratic and tolerance of conservative ideas or conservatives failure to speak and express themselves I think it's a conservatives fault I think it is conservatives fault when I when I get up and give speeches and and I used to go to think tanks and beg them basically we need awards because artists work for love you know we need review venues we need studios we need money we need all these things and they used to look at me and I used to think they're looking at me just like my wife looks at me when I tell her that if something's on sale it still cost money you know they you know she looks at me it's like you're really cute guy but I don't know what you're talking about you know and that that's the way the right looks we let it go we let it go we let the universities go we let the news business go we let that Hollywood go and we should take it back Oh Lord of the multiverse flavor Thank You ver that my proper title I appreciate it I was wondering in a similar vein if you could elaborate on the problem of legitimacy that right wing right wing institutions such as say Hillsdale College or Fox News phase in that even though they are doing the work that you that you want of giving a conservative message of making a cultural of trying to make a cultural in packed in this left-wing narrative and in the mists of this left-wing narrative but it seems as though they're they're fighting an uphill battle because the entrenched left-wing institutions tried to deal Ajith amides I'm tried to say oh that's just a that's just a right-wing outlet you can't trust them they're there making up the facts or they're there completely unreliable how could you say or how would you say that conservatives could fight that best it's it's a brilliant tactic I mean I did a whole video once of just leftist slurs where they would say things like oh that's FoxNews you know that's that's Hillsdale College now all they say there's no argument you know that that's that's old news that's in the past you know they just these these phrases that they come up with to demonize right-wing outlets you know I've got all kinds of problems with Donald Trump but the one thing I really enjoy about him is that he goes after them for this stuff he goes after him for this stuff in some ways the thing I like least about Donald Trump the fact that he's a bore the fact that he has poor manners is sometimes the most effective thing because one of the things the left has done is they have colonized manners so that it has become impolite to speak simple truths so I think the answer here is you've got to fight back the same way like what Trump did to CNN was genius it's a left-wing operation CNN is a left-wing operation and he just pointed it out and I think that if we could do that with it maybe a little less of the the bullying maybe a little less of the boorishness I think that's the right thing to do I think that the idea that we don't fight back enough on these matters is true and we should fight back more what I really like that he talked about argue my I'm from Iran and stuff like that and my my dad says the second guy he hates after Khomeini is Jimmy Carter habit I'm not surprised Ben Affleck would be surprised but I'm that's I wouldn't be here you would have stayed in Iran well I'm talking about is I don't really talk politics with my friends and stuff like that and they really like far out there is that I feel like I may be taking the easy way out but what do you think do i press this stuff with my good friends so like that or just you the trick that I have learned because I've got still got a few left as friends who haven't like kicked me out is if you're gonna talk politics talk principled don't talk people because all people do bad things right and an argument that goes well Barack Obama did this well Trump does this is really not going anywhere but if you start talking about freedom and how you preserve it and if you start talking about what happens in communist countries and you start talking about what happens in socialist countries just the ideas why the ideas don't work I think you can have a civil conversation with your friends and not lose them when you hammer the people you just get into these endless endless arguments that really don't talk about what you're for they just talk about what you're against and we're all against people doing bad things hi drew thank you for coming I did watch your show today loved it my name is Mark and my question was how did the left originally gain such a strong foothold in the media today my theory I guess is it requires less morality and it's probably and it's probably a little easier well you know people have often asked me if left wingers are actually more talented than right wingers and maybe they're you know bringing more time the fact is by the way most of the really great writers were alive today a right wing Tom Stoppard who is I think my my favorite living writer Cormac McCarthy he would never admit it but he's clearly a right winger there's a lot of really good right-wing authors and artists around but one of the things that happened for instance Hollywood was built by a certain generation most of mostly Jewish immigrants and they loved this country because they knew what was out there right they had seen what was out there and they were thrilled to be here and all they wanted their liberalism consisted of include us let us be part of it so they were happy to make movies about good priests and Christian movies happy to make movies that appealed and there were businessmen they wanted to you know make up make money it for a long long boring story after a long boring story that system that studio system was destroyed partly by the government and at the same time the 60s came in and the artists were radicalized and that's pretty much what turned things around I mean the artists came in and they were all radicals all drug users all experimenting with the new sexual freedom and all the stuff and making those pictures you go back and watch those pictures most of them stink but there are a couple of them that are absolutely The Godfather and jaws and things like that they were absolutely spectacular and once that they were entrenched they just keep people out I mean the blacklist that they complain about this blacklist against communists in the in the 50s is nothing compared to what they do to Christians and conservatives today so I think that's where it where it happened I actually believe that there are plenty of talented conservatives but it's like in baseball when when they finally said that baseball that black people could be managers in baseball they opened the door and nobody's there why because the door had been closed with a big sign saying stay out so people went and did other things right it took a while for black people to come in and now that some of the great managers right if Hollywood opens its doors if somebody built a studio that was welcoming to conservatives it might take a while but we would take the culture back quickly I think because we tell better stories we have better stories to tell supreme overlord Clavin king of the multiverse thanks for coming I'm a big fan of your satire surrounding one Jim Acosta and I'm wondering if you could state your full opinions on him and anchors like him and what they could do to change your mind about them ha ha ha quit going to another business you know this is the Dan Rather syndrome you know what what happened during the Nixon era Nixon another one they hated they hated Nixon Nixon was kind of a dark character but the stuff he did was nowhere near as bad as stuff Obama did and Dan Rather used to basically shout at him and say things that at that time said dan Rather Sam Donelson used to shout and say things at at that time were shocking for a reporter to say to a president Jim Acosta is imitating that but to be honest I mean I Dan Rather is not the smartest guy I ever saw he's not the best reporter he made an utter fool of himself during the Bush administration but he was a journalist he did have practice he had been in in various places acosta has no talent he has no talent and really everything he does is an imitation of dan Rather who himself that was the worst thing rather did was the shouting the best thing he did was the journalism so I just think he it's foolish it makes it makes the entire place look bad and the only thing that's funny about it is it's actually not working I mean CNN now has ratings I'm really seriously CNN's ratings consist of people running to catch planes you know if they took skin and out of airports it would vanish if people cut their cable so that they you weren't getting CNN I mean I guess because I want the movie channels right and if the people that CNN would vanish so they've really marginalized themselves and it's kind of comical and fun to watch and Acosta's just a clown hi Andrew thanks for coming tonight I believe I have the answer to your question why Hollywood thinks you're stupid I it is because I am wearing camouflage more specifically I believe that they think that I am stupid people who look like me people who hunt who fish people who use firearms people who are different from them culturally people who are Christians like me people who they automatically assume are stupid several people in my family are farmers in different states in Oklahoma and in Iowa and throughout my life several times I have had people comment on the fact that members of my family are professional farmers and comment in a very derisive sense and that I find really amazing and I think that that is the answer to your question they really don't you know I lived I live in now in the Hollywood Hills my next-door neighbor when I moved in was one of the most famous women in Hollywood I'm not gonna tell you who it was but really really as top as it could be my house was down here she's kind of she trades houses so she was only there for a year but she was there for the first year was there my house was here her house was there I stand out on the patio with a phone screen I would scream about Obama how much I owe and I was at Obama I just could feel her up there you know like watching she is one of the biggest anti-gun campaigners in the country all day long men with guns walked in and out of that house to protect her they used to call they called me and said don't be afraid we're watching your house and I thought I'm glad you're watching my husband I got my own gun it never occurs to this woman one time that those of us who can't afford these bodyguards with guns need guns you know it just doesn't occur to it and it's almost a kind of they're like a kind of royalty they're so elevated above our lives that they really don't understand that you know you say they they think you're stupid I'm not sure they know you're alive you know and I just think it's that's how detach they are hi so I agree with you that as conservatives we do a poor job of fighting back against the leftward drift at the culture and that the left has this almost a monopoly on the culture but I was wondering if you had any ideas on how we could fight back without basically tearing the culture into two parts where the right consumes one set of media and left consumes another set of media and there's not much in common to talk about ya know I think that's a really really good question I mean I was watching yesterday when Barbara Bush died and Obama put out a good statement and Trump without a good statement I thought could we just enjoy this for like five minutes you know nah never mind let's go back to hating each other you know I really think the secret here is humor every age has its art form you know every age has its art form the Elizabethans had the plays the Victorians had the novels that 30s and 40s had the movies I think right now humor is the thing satire is the thing because it's it's easy to make fun of stupid ideas right right now they every single comedian on TV is a left winger and anti-trump ER every single one of those late-night comedians the other day in the New York Times a guy wrote an entire article about on the Roseanne show he said it was like being punched in the gut because it was an anti PC thing and I thought are you kidding me one joke one joke every single comedian on TV but the thing is we don't need TV you know my pal Steve Crowder who's a comedian he his ratings are bigger than theirs on his podcast we have we could still they trying to silence us on YouTube but we still have YouTube we still have the Internet we still have all these places and Twitter people like Twitter some of the funniest people I've ever seen they can stay sec them with humor and everybody likes to laugh and so they even though there's some people who are just are never gonna laugh at themselves that whole range of people in the middle are willing to hear when something is absurd and I think that's the secret and I think that's the kind of I think the two great forms that are coming down the pike are a certain kind of science fiction and humor and I think we should use humor to develop hello mr. Clavin thank you for coming in welcome to Texas thank you my name is Hagan I'm a senior who's graduated this year in May and I was thinking about how Hollywood kind of took over the culture like what caused that and what we can do to fight back against it and I think a big problem is lots of Millennials instead of going out and getting productive jobs once they graduate they're basically sitting home and eating Tide Pods all day so my question is is daily why are hiring I sometimes go on Knowles's shows a millennial you know and I went on it took a tight bot out of my mouth in the middle of a conversation yes they are the daily wire is amazing the daily wire started we started in a the guy who runs the place Jeremy boring has it had a pool he had a pool house where people would go in and change we started doing podcasts in his pool house that was a less than three years ago maybe maybe it was three years ago it is now virtually a TV station and it is just getting bigger and bigger and bigger and yes there I give you my business thank you sir sorry uh so I remember you're talking about how like Hollywood basically shapes Minds right like kind of like alluding to Ben Shapiro is propaganda or whatever so you know I'm more often than not I go to a classroom full of people who lean to the left or just have more liberal values and then sorry conservative should I be afraid to engage in conversation out of of course consideration for their hurt feelings or should I take every chance that I see and just pounce it and prove my teacher wrong with my I I'm so sorry sir right yeah that's that's it you you wouldn't you want to know did you take the chance you should you take the chance you know you're probably asking the wrong person because I've never been able to shut up in my life but I will I will tell you this I will tell you this I I I had a fairly big Hollywood career when I started protesting about what they were doing I was selling sometimes two and three scripts a year which is big money it's really good career and it it dried up I never lost a night's sleep not one night's sleep I never cared I mean I missed the money it was great money you know but there's something about speaking your mind civilly about I'm like one of the most polite people I even ann coulter admitted this about me she said you are really polite you were really polite but but politely politely to say what you have to say kindly civilly to say what you have to say is one of the most ennobling kinds of lives that you can live you know will it cost you it'll cost you you know and do you choose your fights yes do I open my mouth every single time I hear some stupid thing now of course not but I don't ever want to smile and pretend that I agree because once you do that they own you you know and so I'm terribly afraid I'm gonna open my door one day and your parents are gonna be outside and they're gonna kick me down a flight of stairs because you've got thrown out of school but but you know there's there's a statue in chapel in Yale that has written in Latin the words do right fear nothing I use this as a motto in a book and I think it's a great motto you know and I think to speak your mind honestly fairly decently civilly politely is just an ennobling experience and like I said it will cost you and if you like me you'll never lose a night's sleep thank you for coming out mr. Clavin you'd mention like a second ago about how like humor and satire would be our art form that we could work with and as we all know the left can't mean so me wait that's that's our strong point we should definitely work on that but I guess the greater issue at this point is a matter of censorship and how people kind of shut down these voices so since you're sort of in that field how do you see things progressing from here on out with kind of voices being shut up in like channels being demonetised and so on and so forth since that's our biggest like Avenue right now since Hollywood's already gone and so on and so forth it's it's an amazing problem it was completely planned you know it was actually this whole thing about fake news came from the left not from Donald Trump and it was a way of getting people getting Facebook and YouTube and Twitter to accept basically left-wing censors into their midst and they have been working on it media Research Center just did a study showing how badly they have been censoring us you know we have to keep fighting back we have to fight every way we can but but we also have to build our own stuff you know I mean this is the thing I cannot understand about the right this is what I was going around making speeches about why don't we build our own platforms and and you know our platforms shouldn't be conservative platforms our platforms should be open platforms because that's what conservativism is you know it's opening it's belief in free speech it's belief in argument it's belief in debate it's belief in not shutting people down so we should just demonstrate if we could just show them how it's done how America is done I think we could wipe them out you know I mean you look at Fox News look at Fox News how successful they are why isn't there a Fox comedy channel why isn't there a Fox you know drama channel why don't we do those things that are so successful and I just I I don't really know the answer but I think we have to start hello mr. Clavin thank you for coming so I believe in the statement that if you want to end racism then stop talking about race so the question is why does the left in Hollywood and focus so much on ray if it's not to end racism then what do they hope to achieve oh well I think power you know I mean I think it's it's a kind of it's a it's a philosophy of dividing us and basically telling each group of us that they're going to help us as a group so they put you in a grievance group and then they serve your grievance our philosophy is I agree with you the way the way you stop having injustice is to start being just right and the way you are just as you treat everybody fairly everybody who walks up to you is the same person you know the same just let just show me what you can do just show me who you are and that's how I'm gonna treat you and that is the way forward and it's the only way forward because we can't make the pass disappear so I really do believe that their philosophy is a is a power play you know why do you do it because people because there is a history of racism in this country people feel felt very guilty about it and the left manipulates it and uses it I think Barack Obama was a past master at this I think his presidency was a failure and I think he used race to basically shut people up about it and I think that it's to me it's a slimy thing to do you know I mean I just think this is the beautiful thing about this country it really is I mean walk into any airport look around you know the world doesn't look like there's only America still looks like this you know and and we pulled it off and they're trying to move us back everything they call it progressiveness progressive but everything they do is regressive you know it's tribal it is separating people you know we we had this great new idea which is e pluribus unum out of the many will make one their ideas let's take that apart again like nobody's ever tried that before but it works it works it gets them the power they need thank you mr. Clavin I'm a huge fan all thanks so I'm a high school senior and on Friday there's gonna be a walkout that is an anti-gun walkout and it is mandated by the school that I walk out to do it Wow yay Lee I have to do it despite my political beliefs so I'm gonna say given that this is true how can the left claim the moral high ground in the liberal arts and history departments and claim moral subjective is and post-modernism and that all views are equal if they hold these kinds of standards well there their point of view about all views and cultures being equal makes absolutely no sense because what they're actually saying is there's no right or wrong and therefore if you judge somebody else you're wrong and you say well if there's no right or wrong how can I be wrong to judge somebody else that's my thing I like to judge people you know so it makes no no sense which is why they have to mandate why they have to silence because the minute you start arguing back everything falls apart I hope you will go to some news agency and tell them that this is being done because I think that that's a good story you know and I think that people should know that that shouldn't happen to anybody hey you mentioned the need for conservatives to get out and create alternative storytelling venues and get into the arts and the culture more and I'm curious if you have any thoughts or knowledge about why Glenn Beck's attempt to do just that collapsed as spectacularly as it seems to have well you know I have I loved one glen is a great guy Gunn is one of these people who everybody who works for him has been working for him for like thirty years you know and when you see that that's not true of all these big stars right I think that there's a lot of things that happened and some of them I'm not going to talk about because there's none of my business but but but one of the things I think that happened was he made a bet on a subscription model and the subscription model just didn't quite take off he has a huge subscription base but what he didn't count on I think is that it took him out of the general conversation and this is one of the problems we have and breaking through that's still a Stephen Colbert going on TV in the middle of the night it's more powerful than a YouTube video that gets even 10 million hits right these these alternative venues haven't quite garnered the cultural power that they have and he took a really brave step he did a really brave thing and I think it didn't work because that that subscription model doesn't quite have the the cultural heft you know that it has but but I wouldn't be surprised if he comes back he's an enormous ly talented guy and you know he took a big stand against Trump and that probably hurt him with his audience too but he is just an enormous ly talented guy and and he's a real you know he's like been he's a real broadcast talent you know I mean he's one of those guys in a minute you hear him with a microphone you think oh that's what you're born to do you know and like so I wouldn't count them out yet all right one more round of applause for mr. Andrew Clavin so before we wrap up lily is going to take a group picture for us so she'll sit on the stage everyone can stay in their seats and we'll just do a quick picture all together and we'll do one with our cult symbol please so at this time we would like to invite YC team members to stay for a meet and greet with mr. Clavin if you're not a YC team member and you're interested in joining come talk to me or sir Rob or Lily or any of the members afterwards we would love to talk to you about it thank you so much
