00:00:04,257 --> 00:00:04,724
STATE.

2
00:00:04,724 --> 00:00:05,525
GRANTED AN EMERGENCY INJUNCTION

3
00:00:05,525 --> 00:00:06,726
AGAINST THE LAW.

4
00:00:06,726 --> 00:00:08,528
THE CASE CONTINUES IN A LOWER

5
00:00:08,528 --> 00:00:08,828
COURT.

6
00:00:08,828 --> 00:00:10,330
THE PRESIDENT FRESH OFF A RALLY

7
00:00:10,330 --> 00:00:11,097

MARSHA BLACKBURN.

10
00:00:14,267 --> 00:00:15,101
SHE IS HOPING TO REPLACE

11
00:00:15,101 --> 00:00:17,203
OUTGOING SENATOR BOB CORKER IN A

12
00:00:17,203 --> 00:00:18,872
RACE THAT IS CONSIDERED FOR NOW

13
00:00:18,872 --> 00:00:19,973
A TOSS-UP.

14
00:00:19,973 --> 00:00:20,974
>> SHE LOVES YOUR STATE.

15
00:00:20,974 --> 00:00:22,008
SHE LOVES HER COUNTRY.

16
00:00:22,008 --> 00:00:23,743
SHE'S GOING TO WIN.

17
00:00:23,743 --> 00:00:26,212
MARSHA BLACKBURN.

18
00:00:26,212 --> 00:00:26,846
>> Shannon: FRESH OFF THE

19
00:00:26,846 --> 00:00:30,016
STAGE WITH THE PRESIDENT

20
00:00:30,016 --> 00:00:32,652
CONGRESSWOMAN MARSHA BLACKBURN.

21
00:00:32,652 --> 00:00:33,920
THANK YOU FOR JOINING US TODAY.

22
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:35,155
>> GOOD TO BE WITH YOU.

23
00:00:35,155 --> 00:00:35,655
THANK YOU.

24
00:00:35,655 --> 00:00:37,057
>> Shannon: YOU'RE FACING A

25
00:00:37,057 --> 00:00:38,491
MAN WHO WAS A DEMOCRAT, A VERY

26
00:00:38,491 --> 00:00:40,560
POPULAR FORMER GOVERNOR.

27
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:41,962
SCOTT AND PRAISES FROM ONE OF

28
00:00:41,962 --> 00:00:42,696
YOUR REPUBLICAN COLLEAGUES ON

29
00:00:42,696 --> 00:00:44,164
THE SENATE SIDE, THE MAN YOU

30
00:00:44,164 --> 00:00:45,532
HOPE TO REPLACE, SENATOR BOB

31
00:00:45,532 --> 00:00:45,865
CORKER.

32
00:00:45,865 --> 00:00:47,968
A LOT OF FOLKS HAVE NICE THINGS

33
00:00:47,968 --> 00:00:48,535
TO SAY.

34
00:00:48,535 --> 00:00:51,338
WHERE DO YOU GO FROM HERE?

35
00:00:51,338 --> 00:00:52,739
>> WHERE WE GO IS RIGHT TO WORK.

36
00:00:52,739 --> 00:00:54,274
THAT IS WHAT WE HAVE BEEN DOING

37
00:00:54,274 --> 00:00:56,109
EVERY DAY, SHANNON.

38
00:00:56,109 --> 00:00:58,912
JUST WORKING HARD TO GET OUT OUR

39
00:00:58,912 --> 00:01:00,914
MESSAGE AND TO EARN EVERY SINGLE

40
00:01:00,914 --> 00:01:01,214
VOTE.

41
00:01:01,214 --> 00:01:03,083
AND TODAY WAS A GREAT DAY FOR

42
00:01:03,083 --> 00:01:03,350
US.

43
00:01:03,350 --> 00:01:03,917
WE HAD A FUND-RAISER.

44
00:01:03,917 --> 00:01:09,122
WE HAD A RALLY THAT WAS A PACKED

45
00:01:09,122 --> 00:01:10,690
HOUSE AT NASHVILLE'S MUNICIPAL

46
00:01:10,690 --> 00:01:11,491
AUDITORIUM AND WE ARE LOOKING

47
00:01:11,491 --> 00:01:15,128
FORWARD TO CONTINUING TO BUILD

48
00:01:15,128 --> 00:01:17,130
THAT ENERGY AND BUILD THAT

49
00:01:17,130 --> 00:01:17,931
NETWORK THAT IS NECESSARY TO WIN

50
00:01:17,931 --> 00:01:19,466
THIS RACE.

51
00:01:19,466 --> 00:01:20,767
>> Shannon: I KNOW YOU'VE BEEN

52
00:01:20,767 --> 00:01:22,135
CONFRONTED BY WOMEN ON THE

53
00:01:22,135 --> 00:01:22,736
CAMPAIGN TRAIL WHO DON'T

54
00:01:22,736 --> 00:01:25,338
UNDERSTAND YOUR SUPPORT OF

55
00:01:25,338 --> 00:01:26,139
PRESIDENT TRUMP.

56
00:01:26,139 --> 00:01:27,474
THEY DON'T SUPPORT HIM.

57
00:01:27,474 --> 00:01:28,608
THE GOVERNOR, HE ACTUALLY PULLS

58
00:01:28,608 --> 00:01:29,642
BETTER WITH WOMEN IN THIS RACE

59
00:01:29,642 --> 00:01:31,444
THAN YOU DO.

60
00:01:31,444 --> 00:01:33,646
WHAT A   DO YOU ATTRIBUTE THAT Y

61
00:01:33,646 --> 00:01:33,880
WHAT A   DO YOU ATTRIBUTE THAT U

62
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:35,615
AND HOW WE TRY TO CLOSE THAT

63
00:01:35,615 --> 00:01:36,349
GAP?

64
00:01:36,349 --> 00:01:37,117
>> THE WAY TO CLOSE THAT GAP IS

65
00:01:37,117 --> 00:01:39,052
POINTING TO THE FACT THAT WOMEN

66
00:01:39,052 --> 00:01:40,086
EVERY DAY, DONALD TRUMP'S

67
00:01:40,086 --> 00:01:42,155
NUMBERS EVERY DAY IMPROVED WITH

68
00:01:42,155 --> 00:01:43,323
WOMEN BECAUSE WOMEN KNOW HE IS

69
00:01:43,323 --> 00:01:44,657
WORKING HARD TO MAKE THEIR LIVES

70
00:01:44,657 --> 00:01:45,592
BETTER.

71
00:01:45,592 --> 00:01:47,127
LOOK AT WHAT HAS HAPPENED WITH

72
00:01:47,127 --> 00:01:50,964
THE ECONOMY, WITH WAGE

73
00:01:50,964 --> 00:01:51,498
INCREASES, WITH JOB

74
00:01:51,498 --> 00:01:52,332
OPPORTUNITIES.

75
00:01:52,332 --> 00:01:53,066
THESE ARE ALL THINGS THAT ARE

76
00:01:53,066 --> 00:01:53,433
IMPORTANT.

77
00:01:53,433 --> 00:01:57,137
THE ECONOMY, JOBS.

78
00:01:57,137 --> 00:01:57,904
THAT ECONOMIC SECURITY ISSUE IS

79
00:01:57,904 --> 00:02:02,042
THE NUMBER ONE ISSUE WITH WOMEN.

80
00:02:02,042 --> 00:02:03,176
WOMEN ALSO ARE INCREDIBLY

81
00:02:03,176 --> 00:02:04,811
SUPPORTIVE OF WHAT HE IS DOING

82
00:02:04,811 --> 00:02:06,980
WHEN IT COMES TO THE ISSUE OF

83
00:02:06,980 --> 00:02:09,014
IMMIGRATION, SECURING THE

84
00:02:09,014 --> 00:02:11,551
BORDER, ENDING ILLEGAL ENTRY OF

85
00:02:11,551 --> 00:02:15,121
GANGS, OF DRUGS, OF TRAFFICKING.

86
00:02:15,121 --> 00:02:16,723
THOSE ARE PLACES OF FOCUS.

87
00:02:16,723 --> 00:02:19,926
IT IS A WAY FOR US TO BUILD

88
00:02:19,926 --> 00:02:22,162
BRIDGES WITH MANY WOMEN WHO ARE

89
00:02:22,162 --> 00:02:23,730
INDEPENDENT AND DEMOCRATS, AND I

90
00:02:23,730 --> 00:02:26,132
WILL TELL YOU I HAVE

91
00:02:26,132 --> 00:02:26,933
REPUBLICANS, INDEPENDENTS AND

92
00:02:26,933 --> 00:02:28,735
DEMOCRATS ALL WHO ARE ACTIVE IN

93
00:02:28,735 --> 00:02:30,370
OUR CAMPAIGN AND WHO ARE

94
00:02:30,370 --> 00:02:30,870
SUPPORTING ME.

95
00:02:30,870 --> 00:02:31,571
>> Shannon: LET'S TALK ABOUT

96
00:02:31,571 --> 00:02:33,139
ANOTHER BIG ISSUE.

97
00:02:33,139 --> 00:02:34,140
I JUST TALKED TO THEIR ABOUT THE

98
00:02:34,140 --> 00:02:34,874
SUPREME COURT DECIDING IT WOULD

99
00:02:34,874 --> 00:02:37,343
NOT GET IN THE WAY OF THIS

100
00:02:37,343 --> 00:02:38,478
ARKANSAS LAW THAT REQUIRES ANY

101
00:02:38,478 --> 00:02:40,580
CLINICS WHO ARE USING THIS TO

102
00:02:40,580 --> 00:02:41,681
CODRUG PROTOCOL TO PERFORM

103
00:02:41,681 --> 00:02:42,348
ABORTIONS TO HAVE SOME

104
00:02:42,348 --> 00:02:44,317
CONNECTION WITH THE DOCTOR THAT

105
00:02:44,317 --> 00:02:46,319
WITH AND HAVE HOSPITAL ADMITTING

106
00:02:46,319 --> 00:02:48,254
PRIVILEGES IN THE CASE THAT

107
00:02:48,254 --> 00:02:49,556
THERE WAS SOME KIND OF

108
00:02:49,556 --> 00:02:49,989
COMPLICATION.

109
00:02:49,989 --> 00:02:51,925
TWO PLANNED PARENTHOOD CLINICS

110
00:02:51,925 --> 00:02:53,760
BASICALLY SAY THEY WON'T BE ABLE

111
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:54,561
TO PERFORM ABORTIONS IN

112
00:02:54,561 --> 00:02:54,928
ARKANSAS.

113
00:02:54,928 --> 00:02:56,529
I KNOW YOU HEADED UP THE HOUSE

114
00:02:56,529 --> 00:02:58,665
SELECT PANEL THAT WAS LOOKING

115
00:02:58,665 --> 00:02:59,399
INTO ALLEGATIONS AGAINST PLANNED

116
00:02:59,399 --> 00:02:59,799
PARENTHOOD.

117
00:02:59,799 --> 00:03:00,800
WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF THEIR

118
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:01,768
ALLEGATION THAT WOMEN ARE GOING

119
00:03:01,768 --> 00:03:03,670
TO BE LEFT WITH BASICALLY ALMOST

120
00:03:03,670 --> 00:03:06,372
NO OPTION THERE IN ARKANSAS

121
00:03:06,372 --> 00:03:07,107
BASED ON WHAT HAPPENED AT THE

122
00:03:07,107 --> 00:03:09,142
SUPREME COURT?

123
00:03:09,142 --> 00:03:11,211
>> I FEEL LIKE PART OF WHAT YOU

124
00:03:11,211 --> 00:03:11,845
WERE HEARING FROM PLANNED

125
00:03:11,845 --> 00:03:14,447
PARENTHOOD IS A LITTLE BIT OF A

126
00:03:14,447 --> 00:03:15,014
REACH.

127
00:03:15,014 --> 00:03:17,117
WHAT ARKANSAS HAS DONE AND WHAT

128
00:03:17,117 --> 00:03:20,353
THE COURT HAS AGREED WITH IS

129
00:03:20,353 --> 00:03:22,188
THAT THERE SHOULD BE ADDITIONAL

130
00:03:22,188 --> 00:03:25,758
PROTECTIONS FOR WOMEN AND FOR

131
00:03:25,758 --> 00:03:27,393
UNBORN CHILDREN AND THIS IS

132
00:03:27,393 --> 00:03:30,663
SOMETHING THAT ARKANSAS DECIDED

133
00:03:30,663 --> 00:03:33,399
THEY WANTED TO PUT IN PLACE IN

134
00:03:33,399 --> 00:03:36,336
THEIR STATE LAWS AND IT WILL GO

135
00:03:36,336 --> 00:03:36,870
INTO EFFECT.

136
00:03:36,870 --> 00:03:37,537
>> Shannon: THIS IS WHAT

137
00:03:37,537 --> 00:03:38,671
PLANNED PARENTHOOD TWEETED

138
00:03:38,671 --> 00:03:38,972
TODAY.

139
00:03:38,972 --> 00:03:41,341
THE FIGHT IS FAR FROM OVER.

140
00:03:41,341 --> 00:03:42,509
THIS LAW CANNOT AND MUST NOT

141
00:03:42,509 --> 00:03:42,942
STAND.

142
00:03:42,942 --> 00:03:43,877
WE WILL NOT STOP FIGHTING FOR

143
00:03:43,877 --> 00:03:46,513
EVERY PERSON'S RIGHT TO HAVE

144
00:03:46,513 --> 00:03:50,150
ACCESS TO SAFE AND LEGAL

145
00:03:50,150 --> 00:03:50,550
ABORTIONS.

146
00:03:50,550 --> 00:03:51,885
IT'S CLEAR THEY PLAN TO CONTINUE

147
00:03:51,885 --> 00:03:54,154
THE LEGAL FIGHT.

148
00:03:54,154 --> 00:03:54,921
A NUMBER OF SIMILAR LAWS AROUND

149
00:03:54,921 --> 00:03:56,556
THE COUNTRY ARE BEING CHALLENGED

150
00:03:56,556 --> 00:03:57,457
THE COUNTRY ARE BEING CHALLENGE

151
00:03:57,457 --> 00:03:57,857
CHALLENGED.

152
00:03:57,857 --> 00:03:58,591
THERE ARE SPLIT DECISIONS WITH

153
00:03:58,591 --> 00:03:58,958
THE COURT.

154
00:03:58,958 --> 00:03:59,759
WHERE DO YOU THINK WE ARE GOING

155
00:03:59,759 --> 00:04:01,794
AS FAR AS THIS ISSUE ENDING UP

156
00:04:01,794 --> 00:04:02,529
AT THE SUPREME COURT AGAIN ON A

157
00:04:02,529 --> 00:04:06,166
LARGER SCALE?

158
00:04:06,166 --> 00:04:07,167
>> THAT'S EXACTLY THE RIGHT WAY

159
00:04:07,167 --> 00:04:08,034
TO LOOK AT IT.

160
00:04:08,034 --> 00:04:10,436
WHERE DOES IT TAKE US FROM HERE?

161
00:04:10,436 --> 00:04:13,206
AND WHAT WE HEAR IS IF THESE

162
00:04:13,206 --> 00:04:17,744
GROUPS ARE FOR SAFE, LEGAL,

163
00:04:17,744 --> 00:04:19,812
RARE, THEN THEY SHOULD WANT SOME

164
00:04:19,812 --> 00:04:20,779
PROTECTIONS AND RESTRICTIONS

165
00:04:20,779 --> 00:04:21,981
THAT ARE GOING TO BE THERE TO

166
00:04:21,981 --> 00:04:23,683
HELP INFORM WOMEN, TO HELP

167
00:04:23,683 --> 00:04:26,986
EDUCATE WOMEN, TO PROTECT WOMEN

168
00:04:26,986 --> 00:04:27,787
AND TO MAKE CERTAIN THAT THEY

169
00:04:27,787 --> 00:04:30,390
ARE GOING TO BE SAFE, TO MAKE

170
00:04:30,390 --> 00:04:33,526
CERTAIN THAT THERE IS THAT

171
00:04:33,526 --> 00:04:35,361
RELATIONSHIP WITH A PHYSICIAN,

172
00:04:35,361 --> 00:04:36,396
WITH A HEALTH CARE PROVIDER.

173
00:04:36,396 --> 00:04:37,697
TO ME THAT JUST MAKES SENSE THAT

174
00:04:37,697 --> 00:04:41,267
YOU WOULD WANT THAT FOR IT TO BE

175
00:04:41,267 --> 00:04:42,869
THE SAFEST POSSIBLE CONDITION

176
00:04:42,869 --> 00:04:45,338
FOR THESE WOMEN.

177
00:04:45,338 --> 00:04:46,039
>> Shannon: NOT LONG AGO THE

178
00:04:46,039 --> 00:04:48,875
SUPREME COURT STRUCK DOWN SOME

179
00:04:48,875 --> 00:04:50,076
SIMILAR REGULATIONS IN THE STATE

180
00:04:50,076 --> 00:04:50,543
OF TEXAS.

181
00:04:50,543 --> 00:00:00,000
WE WILL CONTINUE TO TRACK THIS
