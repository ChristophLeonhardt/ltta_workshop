USA TODAY CONDUCTED A SURVEY FEATURING LAWMAKERS REPUBLICAN LAWMAKERS IN THE MAIN QUESTION WAS WHETHER OR NOT THEY SUPPORT INCREASED FUNDING TO BUILD TRUMP'S BORDER WALL. NOW WHILE TRUMP WAS CAMPAIGNING THERE WERE MANY REPUBLICANS WHO STOOD BY HIM ON THAT VERY ISSUE, AND NOW IT TURNS OUT THAT THE MAJORITY OF THE GOP IS NOT IN FAVOR OF SPENDING TAXPAYER MONEY TO CONSTRUCT THE WALL. LET ME GIVE YOU THE DETAILS I FIND THIS SURVEY SO INTERESTING. BY THE WAY, THERE WERE SOME LAWMAKERS WHO REFUSED TO ANSWER OR JUST DIDN'T TAKE PART IN THE SURVEY, THREE REPUBLICANS SAID THEY OPPOSED THE MONEY, SEVERAL EVADED A DIRECT ANSWER, AND THE REST SIMPLY REFUSED TO RESPOND TO THE QUESTION. AGAIN, A PRETTY SMALL NUMBER OF LAWMAKERS BEHIND FUNDING THIS BORDER WALL. ANYTHING TO GET A REPUBLICAN TO THE WHITE HOUSE. WE WILL SAY ANYTHING, AGREE WITH ANYTHING, TACITLY SUPPORT ANYTHING HE'S SAYING HE IS RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT. BUT ONCE IT GETS THERE IT'S DIFFERENT. AND WILL HURD FROM TEXAS, FROM A DISTRICT MADE UP OF A LOT OF HISPANIC AMERICANS, HE'S SOMEONE WHO IS EYEING LEADERSHIP, SOMEONE WHO WANTS TO A) WIN REELECTION BUT B) MOVE UP IN THE HOUSE, HE SEES THIS STEVE PEARCE FROM NEW MEXICO, THESE ARE BORDER STATES, AND JEFF FLAKE, OF COURSE, WHO IS NO FAN OF THE PRESIDENT'S TO BEGIN WITH. SO HEARING THESE VOICES, I THINK INSIGHT IS WHAT WE BELIEVE, THAT NOBODY REALLY BELIEVED THIS WAS A GREAT PIECE OF POLICY. TRUMP'S BASE DID. THE REPUBLICANS WHO WENT ALONG, THE DYED IN THE WOOL REPUBLICANS WENT ALONG WITH HIM, THE POLITICAL VETERANS WHO WENT ALONG WITH HIM, YOU NEVER BELIEVE THEY REALLY BELIEVED IN HIM, THEY JUST DIDN'T WANT THEY WANTED A REPUBLICAN IN THE WHITE HOUSE AT ALL COSTS, AND THAT'S WHAT THEY GOT. THAT'S WHAT THEY GOT. SORT OF. SORT OF, RIGHT. I DON'T EVEN THINK TRUMP HAS A REAL IDEOLOGY. I THINK HE GOES BACK AND FORTH AND JUST IS THAT WILDCARD THAT WE EXPECTED HIM TO BE. HE'S INCREDIBLY UNPREDICTABLE. AND SWITCHING GEARS FOR ONE SECOND TO MAKE MY POINT, A LOT OF REPUBLICANS STOOD BEHIND HIM BECAUSE THEY BELIEVE IN PARTY POLITICS. THAT IS THE PRIORITY, RIGHT? AND NOW THERE ARE PEOPLE BEING IMPLICATED IN THIS RUSSIA INVESTIGATION, THEY ARE CONCERNED ABOUT THAT. BUT HERE'S THE THING, IF YOU ARE GOING TO PUT YOUR NAME BEHIND A PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE, IF YOU ARE GOING TO TAKE A POSITION AS A WHITE HOUSE STAFFER, AND YOU KNOW THIS INDIVIDUAL IS SHADY, THAT YOU WILL BE INVOLVED IN SHADY DEALINGS. YOU MIGHT GET INVESTIGATED. IF TRUMP MADE SOME SORT OF FINANCIAL DEAL WITH THE RUSSIANS, AND THE SPECIAL COUNSEL OR THE PENTAGON WANTS TO DO AN INVESTIGATION TO FIND OUT WHAT'S GOING ON, WHETHER THERE WAS COLLUSION OR OBSTRUCTION OF JUSTICE, THERE ARE THINGS IN LIFE THAT ARE MORE IMPORTANT THAN YOUR POLITICAL IDENTITY. AND WHAT I MEAN BY THAT IS, WHAT ARE YOUR PRINCIPLES? IF YOUR PRINCIPAL IS I'M JUST GOING TO SUPPORT EVERY REPUBLICAN NO MATTER WHAT, THEN YOU DON'T REALLY STAND FOR ANYTHING. YOU HAVE TO STAND FOR ACTUAL IDEAS AND STICK BY THAT. AND IF LAWMAKERS ABANDON YOU WHEN IT COMES TO THOSE IDEAS THEN YOU SHOULDN'T CONTINUE SUPPORTING THEM. YOU ARE 1000% RIGHT, AND THAT IS WHAT IS LACKING IN THIS COUNTRY, AND IN MOST COUNTRIES TOO I THINK. IF YOU PICK A PATH, YOU GO DOWN THAT PATH. BUT THESE PEOPLE SUPPORTED DOLL TRUMP BECAUSE OF NEIL GORSUCH, BECAUSE OF OBAMACARE REPEAL. THAT LITTLE SILLY THING ABOUT THE WALL AND THESE THINGS HE SAID ABOUT WOMEN, FORGET THAT, WE WILL GET NEIL GORSUCH ON THE SUPREME COURT AND THEN WE WILL GET WHAT WE WANT IN TERMS OF SOCIAL CONSERVATISM. THERE IS HYPOCRISY THERE. EVERYONE HAS TO SWALLOW A LITTLE HYPOCRISY WHEN YOU VOTE FOR SOMEONE FOR PRESIDENT. YOU VOTED FOR HILLARY CLINTON FOR PRESIDENT, YOU WEREN'T WILD ABOUT HER. NOT AT ALL. BUT THE RNC FOR ME WAS A HUGE WAKE-UP CALL. WHAT I'M SAYING IS AT ANYTIME, IF I'M WILD ABOUT THE CANDIDATE, IF I CAN'T WAIT TO VOTE FOR HILLARY CLINTON, THERE ARE MISGIVINGS ALL THE TIME, EVERYONE I VOTED FOR. I KNOW THERE'S NO SUCH THING AS A PERFECT CANDIDATE, BUT TRUMP WAS NEVER SPECIFIC ABOUT ANYTHING. OKAY, HE WAS SPECIFIC ABOUT BUILDING A BORDER WALL AND HAVING MEXICO PAY FOR IT. BUT WHEN IT CAME TO THE NITTY-GRITTY, THE DETAILS OF HOW HE WOULD GET MEXICO TO PAY FOR IT HE NEVER HAD AN ANSWER. AND NO REPUBLICAN REALLY HELD HIS FEET TO THE FIRE WHEN IT CAME TO THOSE THINGS. TOTALLY TRUE. ALTHOUGH YOU COULD ARGUE THAT 16 OF THEM DID DURING THE CAMPAIGN, AND THAT WENT NOWHERE, AND AT A CERTAIN POINT, WHAT DO WE DO NOW? BUT YOU ARE RIGHT IN THEORY. NOBODY COULD PENETRATE, IRONICALLY, THE WALL OF TRUMP. AND THAT'S WHAT HAPPENED THIS LAST TIME OUT.
