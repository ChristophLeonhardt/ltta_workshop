RUSSIA WILL BE HOLDING ELECTIONS
VERY SOON AND THERE ARE SOME
VIDEOS THAT ARE GOING VIRAL ON
SOCIAL MEDIA, ONE OF WHICH
HAS A HOMOPHOBIC MESSAGE FOR
VOTERS.
THE WHOLE POINT OF THIS VIDEO IS
TO ENCOURAGE PEOPLE TO VOTE
EVEN THOUGH IT DOES NOT REALLY
MATTER.
PUTIN IS GOING TO WIN:
LET ME SET THIS UP FOR YOU AND
GIVE YOU A LITTLE CONTEXT
WHAT YOU ARE ABOUT TO SEE.
AT THAT POINT THE HOMOPHOBIC
FEAR MONGERING BEGINS 
TO
TAKE A LOOK.
SO THE POINT OF THE VIDEO IS IF
YOU DO NOT GET OUT THERE AND
VOTE, THE POLITICIAN YOU DO NOT
LIKE IS GOING TO PASS LAWS
THAT ALLOW GAY PEOPLE TO STAY IN
YOUR HOME?
I DO NOT GET IT BUT WHAT DOES
NOT SURPRISE ME IS THAT
THERE WAS A HOMOPHOBIC MESSAGE
BECAUSE FOR EVERYONE WHO
THINKS RUSSIA IS THIS GREAT
PLACE AND DOESN'T EVER
DESERVE ANY CRITICISM, IF YOU
CAN REMEMBER JUST BACK IN
2012 THEY HAD STARTED PASSING
LAWS THAT ESSENTIALLY
PERSECUTED GAY PEOPLE SO THIS IS
JUST A SYMPTOM OF THAT.
BY THE WAY, HOMOPHOBIA IS NOT
THE ONLY ISSUE IN THAT AD.
I DO NOT KNOW IF YOU CAUGHT IN
THAT LITTLE SNIPPET THERE
AT A DIFFERENT PORTION OF THE
ADDED, THE MILITARY GENERAL
SHOWS UP WHAT YOU SEE HIM AND
THE TWO GUARDS.
ONE OF THE GUARDS WHO SHOWS UP
WITH THE GENERAL IS BLACK
DOT IN RUSSIA.
THEY ARE GOING TO SEND BLACK
PEOPLE TO YOUR HOUSE TO
ENFORCE THE LAW IN RUSSIA.
AND THEN THEY'RE GOING TO PUT
GAY PEOPLE IN YOUR HOUSE AND
IN THE AD EVENTUALLY ENDS WITH A
GAY GUY IN BED WITH THAT GUY.
HE SEEMS LIKE HE IS WAKING UP
FROM A DREAM BUT IT IS A
GAY GUY IN HIS BED.
WHY BOTHER IS A GOOD QUESTION
BECAUSE YOU THINK WE HAVE
RIGGED ELECTIONS?
YOU SHOULD GET A LOAD OF RUSSIA.
WILL LITERALLY NOT ALLOW THE
MOST POPULAR OPPONENTS OF
HIM TO RUN IN THE ELECTION.
HE JUST SAYS YOU ARE BANNED AND
I'M DONE WITH THAT.
THAT MUST BE CONVENIENT.
THEY WILL MAKE UP NONSENSE
CRIMINAL CHARGES AGAINST
HIS OPPONENT, THE OPPONENT WHO
ACTUALLY HAVE A SHOT AT
WINNING AND THEN THAT PERSON IS
UNABLE TO RUN AGAINST PUTIN.
AND SOMETIMES THEY DON'T EVEN
BOTHER MAKING UP CHARGES,
THEY JUST SAY YOU ARE NOT
ALLOWED TO RUN.
MOST OF TIMES THE POLITICAL
OPPONENTS ARE IMPRISONED.
SOMETIMES THEY ARE KILLED
MYSTERIOUSLY.
I'M SURE PUTIN HAS NOTHING TO DO
IT.
JOURNALISTS COVERING THE
MYSTERIOUS DISAPPEARANCES
ALSO ARE KILLED OR DECIDE TO
COMMIT SUICIDE BY DROPPING
A PIANO ON THEIR OWN HEADS.
SO WHY BOTHER DOING THIS AD?
PUTIN WANTS TO HAVE BIG NUMBERS
SO HE CAN GO OUT THERE AND GO,
BY THE WAY, HIS MAIN OPPONENT
WHO IS NOT ALLOWED IN THE RACE,
THE LEADER OF THE PROGRESS
PARTY IS URGING VOTERS TO, HIS
SUPPORTERS, NOT TO VOTE.
IT IS A SHAM ELECTION, DON'T
EVEN BOTHER.
SO THEN PUTIN WANTS ALL OF HIS
SUPPORTERS GOT THERE AND
SAY WHAT, 80% OF THE COUNTRY IS
ON MY SIDE.
TOTAL NONSENSE GARBAGE.
I GET WHY THE RIGHT-WINGERS LIKE
THIS DICTATOR.
HE IS FRIENDS WITH TRUMP AND HE
LIKES TO FIX OUR ELECTIONS
LIKE HE LIKES TO FIX HIS
ELECTIONS BUT THERE ARE
SOME PROGRESSIVES WHO STILL
DEFEND THIS GUY.
WHAT I WANT TO KNOW ABOUT
THOSE PROGRESSIVES IS, DID
THEY DEFEND HIM WHEN HE SENT
MEMBERS OF PUSSY RIOT TO PRISON
BECAUSE THEY HAD THE AUDACITY TO
PROTEST AT THE CATHOLIC CHURCH?
WERE YOU SUPPORTIVE OF HIM BACK
THEN?
ARE YOU SUPPORTIVE OF HIM WHEN
HIS ALLIES RUN ADS LIKE THIS?
CREATING DEMAGOGUERY TO RILE UP
HIS BASE TO HATE OTHERS
LIKE GAY PEOPLE IN THE COUNTRY.
WHAT PART OF THIS RIGHT WING
DICTATOR DO YOU ENJOY AS A
PROGRESSIVE?
NO, LET'S IMMEDIATELY
DISTRACT FROM THE
CONVERSATION BY TALKING ABOUT
EVERYTHING THE U.S. DOES THAT
WE DON'T LIKE EVEN THOUGH IT IS
COMPLETELY UNRELATED TO
THIS STORY.
BY THE WAY, YOU CAN TELL THAT
WE ARE A LITTLE FRUSTRATED
ABOUT THIS ISSUE.
AGAIN, REPUBLICANS I GET, I
UNDERSTAND.
THEY WOULD LOVE A STRONGMAN LIKE
THIS THAT BLAMES BLACKS AND
GAYS IN THIS COUNTRY FOR THEIR
PROBLEMS.
THEY WOULD CELEBRATE IT AND SO I
UNDERSTAND THEIR MOTIVATION
COMPLETELY.
IF YOU ARE A PROGRESSIVE YOU ARE
ALLOWED TO DO AND THINK TWO
THINGS AT ONCE.
YOU ARE ALLOWED TO SAY THE U.S.
HAS DONE A LOT OF TERRIBLE
THINGS
AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO FIXING
THEM AND HERE'S THE POLICY
POSITIONS TO FIX THEM AND AT THE
SAME TIME SAY HEY, MAYBE PUTIN
AND THIS CURRENT RUSSIAN
GOVERNMENT DOESN'T HAVE THE
BEST OF INTENTIONS FOR ITS OWN
PEOPLE, FOR US, FOR ANYONE ELSE.
THE GUY MURDERS POLITICAL
OPPONENTS AND JOURNALISTS.
HOW COULD ANY PROGRESSIVES SAY
THAT THEY ARE IN SUPPORT OF
THIS GUY?
HE IS NOTHING BUT PURE EVIL.
OH NO, YOU GUYS ARE DOING RED
SCARE, FEAR MONGERING.
LET ME GUESS, SOME RUSSIAN
BOT TOLD YOU THAT THE AD
IS ACTUALLY NOT RUN BY PUTIN
ALLIES EVEN THOUGH IT SEEMS
TO SUPPORT PUTIN 100%, IT IS
ACTUALLY RUN BY HILLARY CLINTON.
WHATEVER.
AND BY THE WAY, THE PERSON WHO
PROBABLY CONVINCED YOU OF
THAT ONLINE WAS PROBABLY A
ROBOT.
ENJOY THAT.
IF YOU TAKE OFFENSE, IF YOU DO
NOT THINK ANY OF THAT STUFF
THEN DON'T TAKE OFFENSE.
SAY YOU KNOW WHAT, WHETHER PUTIN
IS A BAD GUY OR NOT IS NOT
RELATED TO THE DIFFERENT ISSUES
THAT I CARE ABOUT.
NOTHING WRONG WITH THAT STANCE.
IT IS NOT RELATED, A GROUP WITH
YOU.
THOSE ISSUES ARE MONUMENTALLY
IMPORTANT.
USUALLY THE MAINSTREAM MEDIA
DOESN'T COVER THEM ENOUGH.
THE DEMOCRATS ARE USING IT
AS AN AXIS OR LOSING THE
ELECTION, ABSOLUTE RIGHT THAT IF
YOU ARE IN THAT CAMP, WE
HAVE NO BEEF AT ALL.
IF YOU ARE IN THE WEIRDO CAMP
THAT YOU THINK PUTIN IS A
GOOD GUY AND THAT ANY CRITICISM
OF HIS GOVERNMENT IS
SOMEHOW AGAINST THE RUSSIAN
PEOPLE AND IS MEANT TO
DISTRACT BECAUSE WE CAN ONLY
FOCUS ON ONE THING AT A
TIME, MEANT TO DISTRACT FROM ALL
THE OTHER THINGS THAT ARE GOING
WRONG IN THE WORLD, THEN WE DO
NOT AGREE AND 
THAT IS THAT.
