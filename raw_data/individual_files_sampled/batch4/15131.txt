Michelle Wolf's Netflix show is cancelled after three months Netflix has been desperately trying to launch a successful talk show the online television network that's basically what it is has had huge success in the airing of classic shows and producing its own new shows and movies but it's never been able to crack the talkshow market I suspect it's probably something to do with the fact that most people who watch talk shows don't use Netflix they're more likely to tune in with a remote control and on a television in the living room whereas the younger generation will watch TV on their iPhones and iPads anywhere in the house so Netflix decided to produce talk shows for younger people appealing to the far left crowd and in the process failing miserably from the Bill Nighy signs show that denied basic science surrounding biological gender to Chelsea Handler's show that was axed after two seasons Netflix has tried to appeal to the far left but it just keeps going wrong and instead of changing course big double down when dumb people double down on a dumb idea I've heard it being called tumbling down and I think that sums this up quite well Netflix Dumble down and gave Michelle wolf her own show what could go wrong right well at the launch of her show she performed a salute to abortion one of the most distasteful jokes I've ever seen I think even some pro-choicers Winstead it abortion isn't something to laugh about no matter what side of the argument you're on it's a sad and emotionally traumatic thing but there was Michelle wolf on stage dressed up like some baton twirler from a marching band saluting abortion on the 4th of July she probably thought being shocking and sticking her finger up to what she probably thinks is the old white man's Republican establishment would have won her favors with viewers but it didn't her show has been canceled only after three months three I mean at least that nasty piece of work Chelsea Handler got a couple of seasons under her belt but viewers I couldn't even stomach wilt show for a few months no viewership figures have been released and the National Review rightly points out that the network has the unique ability to see how many people really watch their shows they don't have Nielsen ratings they see exactly how many people watch each show and with their millions of subscribers their net income of reportedly two hundred and ninety point 1 million in just the first quarter this year means they have more than enough to spend the relatively cheap production of her talk show so why would they get rid of her it all points to low ratings and who can blame the viewers I think this makes a wider point about society as well audiences were vocal about it they shout it from the rooftops how funny she was but in reality nobody watched it in the real world the left shout from the rooftops and tries to claim the moral high ground but they utterly fail in convincing the general public that they're right about things this is exactly why Trump won the far-left doesn't have the same numbers as the same decent people of America these people are just making TV terrible they use their loud voices to scream and shout about shows like Roseanne which did incredibly well with the ratings but ultimately got cancelled they use that same voice to put people like Michelle wolf on television only for the show's to prove so unpopular they have to be taken back off the air the left ruin fun they ruin art they ruin a popular culture and they ruin lives if you want to see more from me and the rest of the rebel team like and subscribe you
