00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:21,930
to listen<font color="#E5E5E5"> to everyone in my high school</font>

135
00:06:21,930 --> 00:06:24,720
and my high school<font color="#CCCCCC"> was small you know</font>

136
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:26,160
there were only like a hundred<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

137
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:27,479
twelve people in my graduating class

138
00:06:27,479 --> 00:06:29,460
because it was a magnet<font color="#CCCCCC"> school like a</font>

139
00:06:29,460 --> 00:06:31,919
specialty school so everyone knew

140
00:06:31,919 --> 00:06:34,140
everyone and it was just like everyone

141
00:06:34,140 --> 00:06:35,330
saw that<font color="#E5E5E5"> and there</font>

142
00:06:35,330 --> 00:06:41,870
yeah it was so great what are my hopes

143
00:06:41,870 --> 00:06:47,270
and dreams mmm that's tough I mean hopes

144
00:06:47,270 --> 00:06:48,800
and dreams<font color="#CCCCCC"> wise i think i just want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

145
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:53,270
live the best life I can with the means

146
00:06:53,270 --> 00:06:55,610
that i have had and a hope and a dream

147
00:06:55,610 --> 00:06:59,210
is to become you know that next level

148
00:06:59,210 --> 00:07:01,639
financially secure like millionaire

149
00:07:01,639 --> 00:07:07,460

<font color="#CCCCCC">it money does really make the world go</font>

151
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:11,810
round in my personal opinion and if I

152
00:07:11,810 --> 00:07:16,039
had an obscene amount of wealth I feel

153
00:07:16,039 --> 00:07:18,860
like I would really<font color="#CCCCCC"> want to give it away</font>

154
00:07:18,860 --> 00:07:20,629
