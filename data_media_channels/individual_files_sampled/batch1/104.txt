from the moment Brett Kavanaugh sat down for his confirmation hearing to become a US Supreme Court justice out first after outburst at least 30 people were arrested on Tuesday for disorderly conduct then it was the Democratic senators turned to disrupt the hearing mr. chairman we have been denied we have been denied real access to the documents we need to advisor 'men regular orders calls which turns this hearing into a charade and a mockery of our norms well mr. chairman I therefore move to adjourn this hearing the Democrats and progressive groups are trying whatever they can to stop Cavanaugh from joining the High Court they accused the appeals court judge of wanting to outlaw abortion of favoring businesses over employees unions and consumers and of wanting to end all restrictions on firearms ownership Democrats are also accusing Republicans of trying to rush through Cavanaugh's confirmation for political purposes namely to protect President Donald Trump the interruptions and accusations angered Republicans who run the Judiciary Committee this is the first confirmation hearing for a Supreme Court justice I've seen basically according to mob rule can I ask my colleagues on the other side of the aisle how long you want to go on with this because I'm not going to entertain any of the motions you're making do you want this to go on all day because I have been patient at the end of the day Cavanaugh finally had a moment to speak and he addressed the question about his ability to be fair over the past 12 years I've ruled sometimes for the prosecution and sometimes for criminal defendants sometimes for workers and sometimes for businesses sometimes for environmentalists and sometimes for coal miners despite the protests and the parliamentary maneuvers it does appear that Judge Brett Kavanaugh will be joining the US Supreme Court Republicans control the Senate as well as the Judiciary Committee and they're convinced that they have the vote as well as the confidence to get there man on the high court Rosalind Jordan al-jazeera Capitol Hill
