HE DECLINED.

37
00:00:57,492 --> 00:00:59,327
OF COURSE HE DID, THEY ALWAYS

HAS THE SMOKING GUN.

44
00:01:06,101 --> 00:01:06,835
THREE MONTHS AGO WE MADE THIS

00:01:06,835 --> 00:01:09,337
OFFER TO CONGRESSMAN OF

GIVE US EVIDENCE, REAL EVIDENCE

60
00:01:30,125 --> 00:01:32,861
OF RUSSIAN COLLUSION FOR TRUMP'S

61
00:01:32,861 --> 00:01:34,029
CAMPAIGN AND TO HIS CREDIT,

62
00:01:34,029 --> 00:01:34,763
TONIGHT HE IS TAKING US UP ON

63
00:01:34,763 --> 00:01:36,865
THAT OFFER.

64
00:01:36,865 --> 00:01:37,799
THERE'S NOTHING STAGED ABOUT

65
00:01:37,799 --> 00:01:39,067
THIS CONVERSATION, THE ONE YOU

66
00:01:39,067 --> 00:01:39,901
ARE ABOUT TO SEE.

67
00:01:39,901 --> 00:01:42,437
IF THE CONGRESSMAN HAS PROVED

68
00:01:42,437 --> 00:01:43,671
THE TRUMP PEOPLE COLLUDED WITH A

69
00:01:43,671 --> 00:01:45,473
FOREIGN POWER WILL BE THE FIRST

70
00:01:45,473 --> 00:01:46,274
TO CALL FOR INDICTMENTS.

71
00:01:46,274 --> 00:01:48,076
BUT IF HE DOESN'T HAVE THAT

72
00:01:48,076 --> 00:01:50,078
PROOF, IF AFTER ALL THIS TIME

73
00:01:50,078 --> 00:01:51,246
THERE IS STILL NO REAL EVIDENCE

74
00:01:51,246 --> 00:01:52,881
OF COLLUSION THEN WE WILL KNOW

75
00:01:52,881 --> 00:01:53,915
FOR CERTAIN THAT THIS WHOLE

76
00:01:53,915 --> 00:01:55,884
THING IS A LIE THAT HAS BADLY

77
00:01:55,884 --> 00:01:56,451
DAMAGED OUR COUNTRY.

78
00:01:56,451 --> 00:01:57,886
WE ARE GOING TO FIND OUT IN JUST

79
00:01:57,886 --> 00:02:00,255
A MINUTE.

80
00:02:00,255 --> 00:02:01,122
MEANWHILE, THE RUSSIAN

81
00:02:01,122 --> 00:02:02,690
INVESTIGATION CONTINUES TO

82
00:02:02,690 --> 00:02:03,691
EXPOSE DEEP AND TERRIFYING

83
00:02:03,691 --> 00:02:05,093
CORRUPTION IN WASHINGTON, NOT IN

84
00:02:05,093 --> 00:02:07,062
THE WAYS PEOPLE WHO LAUNCHED IT

85
00:02:07,062 --> 00:02:07,896
EXPECTED.

86
00:02:07,896 --> 00:02:10,632
ON FRIDAY, "THE NEW YORK TIMES"

87
00:02:10,632 --> 00:02:11,366
AND "WASHINGTON POST" REPORTED

88
00:02:11,366 --> 00:02:12,067
THAT THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION

89
00:02:12,067 --> 00:02:13,535
EMPLOYED A SPY WHO POSED AS AN

90
00:02:13,535 --> 00:02:15,303
ADVISOR TO THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN

91
00:02:15,303 --> 00:02:18,106
DURING THE 2016 ELECTION.

92
00:02:18,106 --> 00:02:20,008
HE WAS A LONGTIME CIA ASSET WHO

93
00:02:20,008 --> 00:02:22,277
FED INFORMATION BACK TO FEDERAL

94
00:02:22,277 --> 00:02:22,844
INTELLIGENCE AGENCIES.

95
00:02:22,844 --> 00:02:24,879
THE OBAMA PEOPLE LIED ABOUT

96
00:02:24,879 --> 00:02:25,313
DOING THIS.

97
00:02:25,313 --> 00:02:27,082
AS FAR AS WE KNOW NOTHING LIKE

98
00:02:27,082 --> 00:02:29,284
THAT HAS EVER HAPPENED IN

99
00:02:29,284 --> 00:02:29,884
AMERICAN HISTORY.

100
00:02:29,884 --> 00:02:30,585
RICHARD NIXON WAS ACCUSED OF

101
00:02:30,585 --> 00:02:32,487
LESS THAN THAT AND HE LEFT

102
00:02:32,487 --> 00:02:33,088
OFFICE.

103
00:02:33,088 --> 00:02:33,955
YOU WOULD THINK THE

104
00:02:33,955 --> 00:02:35,457
SELF-DESCRIBED GUARDIANS OF

105
00:02:35,457 --> 00:02:37,692
DEMOCRACY IN THE MEDIA WOULD BE

106
00:02:37,692 --> 00:02:38,526
HORRIFIED BY THE SUGGESTION OF

107
00:02:38,526 --> 00:02:39,928
PARTISAN SPYING NO MATTER WHAT

108
00:02:39,928 --> 00:02:41,096
THEY THINK OF TRUMP PERSONALLY.

109
00:02:41,096 --> 00:02:43,131
BUT THEY ARE NOT HORRIFIED.

110
00:02:43,131 --> 00:02:43,898
INSTEAD THEY ARE AGGRESSIVELY

111
00:02:43,898 --> 00:02:45,533
DEFENDING IT LIKE THE CRATE AND

112
00:02:45,533 --> 00:02:47,302
LACKEYS THEY ARE.

113
00:02:47,302 --> 00:02:48,036
"THE WASHINGTON POST" OVER THE

114
00:02:48,036 --> 00:02:49,137
WEEKEND ACTUALLY RAN AN OP-ED

115
00:02:49,137 --> 00:02:50,505
WITH THIS HEADLINE, WE ARE NOT

116
00:02:50,505 --> 00:02:51,706
MAKING THIS UP.

117
00:02:51,706 --> 00:02:53,475
"THE FBI DIDN'T USE AN INFORMANT

118
00:02:53,475 --> 00:02:55,276
TO GO AFTER TRUMP, THEY USED ONE

119
00:02:55,276 --> 00:02:58,480
TO PROTECT HIM."

120
00:02:58,480 --> 00:02:59,180
AMAZINGLY "THE NEW YORK TIMES"

121
00:02:59,180 --> 00:02:59,747
AGREED WITH THAT.

122
00:02:59,747 --> 00:03:01,483
HERE WAS IT STORY ON THE

123
00:03:01,483 --> 00:03:02,183
SUBJECT.

124
00:03:02,183 --> 00:03:02,984
"FBI USED INFORMANT TO

125
00:03:02,984 --> 00:03:04,953
INVESTIGATE RUSSIA TIES TO

126
00:03:04,953 --> 00:03:07,288
CAMPAIGN, NOT TO SPY."

127
00:03:07,288 --> 00:03:08,656
IN OTHER WORDS, DONALD TRUMP

128
00:03:08,656 --> 00:03:13,294
SHOULD BE GRATEFUL THAT OBAMA'S

129
00:03:13,294 --> 00:03:14,162
SPIES SPYING ON HIM.

130
00:03:14,162 --> 00:03:14,896
IT'S FOR THEIR OWN GOOD.

131
00:03:14,896 --> 00:03:15,930
THE PEOPLE WHO WROTE THIS SHOULD

132
00:03:15,930 --> 00:03:18,733
BE ASHAMED.

133
00:03:18,733 --> 00:03:19,434
IT'S PARTISAN CHEERLEADING AND

134
00:03:19,434 --> 00:03:20,969
EMBARRASSINGLY CREDULOUS.

135
00:03:20,969 --> 00:03:21,936
JUST TRANSCRIBE WHATEVER SPIN

136
00:03:21,936 --> 00:03:23,204
YOU GOT FROM YOUR FBI SOURCE AND

137
00:03:23,204 --> 00:03:25,273
CALL IT A NEW STORY.

138
00:03:25,273 --> 00:03:26,307
HOW WITH THESE IDIOT REPORTERS

139
00:03:26,307 --> 00:03:28,276
FEEL IF THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION

140
00:03:28,276 --> 00:03:29,544
READ THEIR EMAILS OR TAPPED

141
00:03:29,544 --> 00:03:30,311
THEIR CELL PHONES WERE SENT A

142
00:03:30,311 --> 00:03:31,679
SPY TO SPY ON THEM AND THEN

143
00:03:31,679 --> 00:03:34,082
CLAIMED IT WAS ALL FOR THEIR OWN

144
00:03:34,082 --> 00:03:34,716
GOOD?

145
00:03:34,716 --> 00:03:35,517
OBVIOUSLY THEY WOULD BE OUTRAGED

146
00:03:35,517 --> 00:03:38,553
AND SO WOULD WE, BECAUSE WE ARE

147
00:03:38,553 --> 00:03:41,089
NOT HACKS.

148
00:03:41,089 --> 00:03:41,756
OBAMA'S CIA DIRECTOR JOHN

149
00:03:41,756 --> 00:03:43,625
BRENNAN BY CONTRACT IS A HACK.

150
00:03:43,625 --> 00:03:45,126
HE'S ALSO A LIAR WHO HAS DONE

151
00:03:45,126 --> 00:03:46,127
MORE TO EMBARRASS AND DISCREDIT

152
00:03:46,127 --> 00:03:47,428
THE INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY THAN

153
00:03:47,428 --> 00:03:48,930
ANY OTHER SINGLE PERSON.

154
00:03:48,930 --> 00:03:50,632
BRENNAN HAS BEEN ON TWITTER

155
00:03:50,632 --> 00:03:51,366
ATTACKING TRUMP AND ANYONE ELSE

156
00:03:51,366 --> 00:03:53,902
WHO WANTS TO KNOW MORE THE ABOUT

157
00:03:53,902 --> 00:03:54,769
THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION'S

158
00:03:54,769 --> 00:03:56,104
SPYING EFFORTS IN THE LAST

159
00:03:56,104 --> 00:03:56,971
CAMPAIGN AS IF AMERICANS DON'T

160
00:03:56,971 --> 00:03:58,473
HAVE A RIGHT TO KNOW WHEN THE

161
00:03:58,473 --> 00:03:59,174
GOVERNMENT WAS SPYING ON THEM

162
00:03:59,174 --> 00:04:01,075
AND WHY.

163
00:04:01,075 --> 00:04:01,943
A RULING CLASS IS COMPLETELY OUT

164
00:04:01,943 --> 00:04:04,846
OF CONTROL, THAT THE REAL LESSON

165
00:04:04,846 --> 00:04:06,381
OF THIS RUSSIAN NONSTATUS.

166
00:04:06,381 --> 00:04:08,917
BYRON YORK FROM THE

167
00:04:08,917 --> 00:04:09,884
"WASHINGTON EXAMINER" AND

168
00:04:09,884 --> 00:04:10,685
JONATHAN TURLEY.

169
00:04:10,685 --> 00:04:12,320
PROFESSOR, FIRST TO YOU.

170
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:13,721
DOES THE PUBLIC, DO AMERICANS

171
00:04:13,721 --> 00:04:15,123
HAVE A RIGHT TO KNOW IF THEY

172
00:04:15,123 --> 00:04:17,125
WERE SPIED ON AND WHY?

173
00:04:17,125 --> 00:04:18,927
>> I THINK THAT THEY DO.

174
00:04:18,927 --> 00:04:20,361
THESE ARE VERY SERIOUS

175
00:04:20,361 --> 00:04:21,062
ALLEGATIONS AND THEY ARE

176
00:04:21,062 --> 00:04:21,495
UNPRECEDENTED.

177
00:04:21,495 --> 00:04:22,764
WE DON'T KNOW WHAT THE TRUTH IS.

178
00:04:22,764 --> 00:04:24,899
MAYBE THERE WAS A VALID REASON

179
00:04:24,899 --> 00:04:25,767
FOR THE INVESTIGATION.

180
00:04:25,767 --> 00:04:27,235
MAYBE THEY USED VALID MEANS, BUT

181
00:04:27,235 --> 00:04:29,938
WE SHOULD WANT TO KNOW.

182
00:04:29,938 --> 00:04:32,874
WHAT I THINK IT IS BEING A CASE

183
00:04:32,874 --> 00:04:33,975
OF WILLFUL BLINDNESS HERE IS

184
00:04:33,975 --> 00:04:35,076
THAT WE HAVE CONFIRMATION THAT

185
00:04:35,076 --> 00:04:36,644
TRUMP APPARENTLY WAS CORRECT

186
00:04:36,644 --> 00:04:39,280
WHEN HE SAID OVER A YEAR AGO

187
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:40,582
THAT HE HAD PEOPLE IN HIS

188
00:04:40,582 --> 00:04:42,083
CAMPAIGN THAT WERE UNDER

189
00:04:42,083 --> 00:04:43,484
SURVEILLANCE AND IT TURNS OUT

190
00:04:43,484 --> 00:04:45,486
THAT IT WAS MUCH BROADER THAN WE

191
00:04:45,486 --> 00:04:47,522
THOUGHT EVEN THOUGH PEOPLE LIKE

192
00:04:47,522 --> 00:04:49,224
CLAPPER AND OTHER IN THE OBAMA'S

193
00:04:49,224 --> 00:04:50,291
ADMINISTRATION DON'T MAKE IT

194
00:04:50,291 --> 00:04:50,858
ADMINISTRATION TO 90.

195
00:04:50,858 --> 00:04:52,493
IT DOES APPEAR TO BE A

196
00:04:52,493 --> 00:04:53,194
SURVEILLANCE PROGRAM, IT DOES

197
00:04:53,194 --> 00:04:54,229
APPEAR TO BE AN INVESTIGATION

198
00:04:54,229 --> 00:04:56,231
AND NOW YOU HAVE AN INDIVIDUAL

199
00:04:56,231 --> 00:04:57,832
WHO REPORTEDLY OFFERED TO BE AN

200
00:04:57,832 --> 00:05:01,169
ADVISOR IN A CAMPAIGN WHEN HE

201
00:05:01,169 --> 00:05:04,505
WAS AN ASSET FOR THE FBI OR THE

202
00:05:04,505 --> 00:05:05,506
CIA OR BOTH.

203
00:05:05,506 --> 00:05:06,941
I CAN'T IMAGINE WHAT JUSTICE

204
00:05:06,941 --> 00:05:14,849
OFFICIAL WOULD SIGN OFF ON THAT.

205
00:05:14,849 --> 00:05:15,617
YOU CAN TRY TO SPLIT THIS AS YOU

206
00:05:15,617 --> 00:05:15,883
MAY.

207
00:05:15,883 --> 00:05:16,651
WHETHER THIS IS AN INVESTIGATION

208
00:05:16,651 --> 00:05:18,286
OR SURVEILLANCE.

209
00:05:18,286 --> 00:05:19,287
BUT FROM A TRUMP STANDPOINT

210
00:05:19,287 --> 00:05:20,121
THERE IS A LEGITIMATE ISSUE.

211
00:05:20,121 --> 00:05:22,190
YOU CAN TELL A VICTIM THIS ISN'T

212
00:05:22,190 --> 00:05:24,292
A MUGGING, IT'S JUST A FORCE

213
00:05:24,292 --> 00:05:25,293
DIVESTITURE BUT IT SURE FEELS

214
00:05:25,293 --> 00:05:26,394
LIKE A MUGGING AND LESS YOU CAN

215
00:05:26,394 --> 00:05:28,496
PROVE TO THE CONTRARY.

216
00:05:28,496 --> 00:05:29,297
>> Tucker: IF BUSH HAD DONE

217
00:05:29,297 --> 00:05:31,366
THIS TO OBAMA I WOULD WANT TO

218
00:05:31,366 --> 00:05:33,868
KNOW WHY AND I THINK IT'S FAIR

219
00:05:33,868 --> 00:05:37,305
TO WANT TO KNOW.

220
00:05:37,305 --> 00:05:39,140
WHEN DID THIS START?

221
00:05:39,140 --> 00:05:39,774
>> THE EMERGENCE OF THIS

222
00:05:39,774 --> 00:05:41,743
INFORMANT HAS KIND OF THROWN

223
00:05:41,743 --> 00:05:42,343
INTO DOUBT OUR PREVIOUS

224
00:05:42,343 --> 00:05:44,112
TIMETABLE OF THIS.

225
00:05:44,112 --> 00:05:45,880
WE'VE ALWAYS BEEN TOLD THAT THE

226
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:48,149
FBI INVESTIGATION FORMALLY

227
00:05:48,149 --> 00:05:50,318
STARTED ON JULY 31ST.

228
00:05:50,318 --> 00:05:51,085
THE ROAD UP SOMETHING CALLED THE

229
00:05:51,085 --> 00:05:53,354
ELECTRONIC COMMUNICATION AND

230
00:05:53,354 --> 00:05:54,088
STARTED THIS INVESTIGATION, BUT

231
00:05:54,088 --> 00:05:56,524
NOW WE HEAR THAT THE INFORMANT

232
00:05:56,524 --> 00:05:58,192
WAS ACTUALLY REACHING OUT AND

233
00:05:58,192 --> 00:06:00,461
TALKING TO TRUMP CAMPAIGN PEOPLE

234
00:06:00,461 --> 00:06:02,930
WELL BEFORE THAT, AT LEAST WEEKS

235
00:06:02,930 --> 00:06:05,066
BEFORE THAT, MAYBE LONGER BEFORE

236
00:06:05,066 --> 00:06:06,634
THAT AND I THINK WHAT YOU ARE

237
00:06:06,634 --> 00:06:08,536
SEEING ON CAPITOL HILL IS SOME

238
00:06:08,536 --> 00:06:10,405
INVESTIGATORS, REPUBLICAN

239
00:06:10,405 --> 00:06:11,539
INVESTIGATORS ARE LOOKING EVEN

240
00:06:11,539 --> 00:06:12,407
FURTHER BACK THAN THAT.

241
00:06:12,407 --> 00:06:13,341
>> Tucker: WHAT WOULD THAT

242
00:06:13,341 --> 00:06:13,708
MEAN?

243
00:06:13,708 --> 00:06:15,043
THAT HE WAS DOING IT LATERALLY

244
00:06:15,043 --> 00:06:16,311
BECAUSE HE WAS INTERESTED OR

245
00:06:16,311 --> 00:06:17,645
THAT HE WAS DOING IT AT THE

246
00:06:17,645 --> 00:06:19,914
DIRECTION OF ONE OF THE OBAMA

247
00:06:19,914 --> 00:06:20,281
AGENCIES?

248
00:06:20,281 --> 00:06:21,716
>> THAT HE WAS DOING IT AT THE

249
00:06:21,716 --> 00:06:23,751
DIRECTION OF AN AGENCY BEFORE

250
00:06:23,751 --> 00:06:26,888
THEY HAD A PRETENSE, A PRETEXT

251
00:06:26,888 --> 00:06:27,722
TO ACTUALLY DO THIS.

252
00:06:27,722 --> 00:06:28,890
SO THAT WOULD BE A BIG ISSUE

253
00:06:28,890 --> 00:06:32,293
INSIDE THE FBI.

254
00:06:32,293 --> 00:06:33,528
ALSO, WE ARE SEEING SOME

255
00:06:33,528 --> 00:06:35,330
INVESTIGATORS LOOKING EVEN

256
00:06:35,330 --> 00:06:37,899
FURTHER BACK TO MARCH.

257
00:06:37,899 --> 00:06:40,101
ON MARCH 21ST TRUMP GOES TO

258
00:06:40,101 --> 00:06:40,768
"THE WASHINGTON POST," MEETS

259
00:06:40,768 --> 00:06:42,136
WITH THEIR EDITORIAL BOARD.

260
00:06:42,136 --> 00:06:43,604
>> Tucker: I REMEMBER VERY

261
00:06:43,604 --> 00:06:44,339
WELL.

262
00:06:44,339 --> 00:06:45,373
>> A LOT OF CRITICISM FOR NOT

263
00:06:45,373 --> 00:06:47,342
HAVING A FOREIGN POLICY

264
00:06:47,342 --> 00:06:48,076
ADVISORS.

265
00:06:48,076 --> 00:06:50,111
IN PART BECAUSE THE ENTIRE

266
00:06:50,111 --> 00:06:52,013
FOREIGN POLICY ESTABLISHMENT HAD

267
00:06:52,013 --> 00:06:52,413
SHUNNED HIM.

268
00:06:52,413 --> 00:06:53,448
THEY ASK HIM WHO ARE YOUR

269
00:06:53,448 --> 00:06:55,516
ADVISORS?

270
00:06:55,516 --> 00:07:00,254
PEOPLES OF PULLS OUT A PIECE OF

271
00:07:00,254 --> 00:07:01,522
PAPER SAYS HERE THEY ARE.

272
00:07:01,522 --> 00:07:03,791
AND ON THE LIST HE SAYS CARTER

273
00:07:03,791 --> 00:07:05,893
PAGE AND GEORGE PAPADOPOULOS.

274
00:07:05,893 --> 00:07:08,162
WE KNOW NOW THAT JAMES COMEY AND

275
00:07:08,162 --> 00:07:09,731
ANDREW McCABE PERSONALLY

276
00:07:09,731 --> 00:07:11,899
BRIEFED LORETTA LYNCH ABOUT

277
00:07:11,899 --> 00:07:12,333
THEM.

278
00:07:12,333 --> 00:07:13,701
AND THEN SHORTLY THEREAFTER THEY

279
00:07:13,701 --> 00:07:15,837
WERE DISCUSSED AT WHAT IS CALLED

280
00:07:15,837 --> 00:07:17,739
THE NATIONAL SECURITY COUNCIL

281
00:07:17,739 --> 00:07:18,706
PRINCIPALS COMMITTEE, WHICH IS

282
00:07:18,706 --> 00:07:20,541
SECRETARIES OF STATE, TREASURY

283
00:07:20,541 --> 00:07:22,910
AND DEFENSE, CIA, ALL THESE

284
00:07:22,910 --> 00:07:23,911
PEOPLE ARE TALKING ABOUT CARTER

285
00:07:23,911 --> 00:07:24,278
PAGE THEN.

286
00:07:24,278 --> 00:07:25,346
>> Tucker: TOTALLY SHOCKING

287
00:07:25,346 --> 00:07:27,415
FOR A PROFESSOR, QUICKLY SINCE

288
00:07:27,415 --> 00:07:28,049
YOU'VE GOT MORE HISTORICAL

289
00:07:28,049 --> 00:07:30,718
PERSPECTIVE ON THIS, THEN MOST

290
00:07:30,718 --> 00:07:32,487
PEOPLE, IT IS ANYTHING LIKE THIS

291
00:07:32,487 --> 00:07:33,554
EVER HAPPENED THAT WE KNOW OF?

292
00:07:33,554 --> 00:07:36,190
>> I KNOW OF NO PRESIDENT.

293
00:07:36,190 --> 00:07:38,126
THEY HAVE A CASE TO MAKE.

294
00:07:38,126 --> 00:07:39,761
THE POINT THOUGH IS FOR THOSE

295
00:07:39,761 --> 00:07:40,962
PEOPLE THAT ARE OBJECTING, WHAT

296
00:07:40,962 --> 00:07:42,930
ARE YOU OBJECTING TO?

297
00:07:42,930 --> 00:07:44,298
THIS IS A SERIOUS MATTER.

298
00:07:44,298 --> 00:07:45,566
NO MATTER HOW YOU FEEL ABOUT

299
00:07:45,566 --> 00:07:46,768
TRUMP, WE NEED TO FIND OUT THE

300
00:07:46,768 --> 00:07:48,469
TRUTH ABOUT THIS.

301
00:07:48,469 --> 00:07:51,773
IF THERE WAS AN INVESTIGATION,

302
00:07:51,773 --> 00:07:53,307
IF THERE WAS AN ASSET WHO TRIED

303
00:07:53,307 --> 00:07:55,309
TO BECOME AN ADVISOR IN THE

304
00:07:55,309 --> 00:07:55,977
CAMPAIGN, THOSE ARE SERIOUS

305
00:07:55,977 --> 00:07:57,311
MATTERS FOR ALL OF US.

306
00:07:57,311 --> 00:07:59,881
AND I THINK THAT TRUMP IS RIGHT.

307
00:07:59,881 --> 00:08:02,016
HE WON ABOUT IT I THINK IN THE

308
00:08:02,016 --> 00:08:04,485
WRONG WAY, BUT HE HAS A

309
00:08:04,485 --> 00:00:00,000
LEGITIMATE OBJECTION HERE THAT
