the United States,
here in Jerusalem,
the capital of Israel.
Thank you.”
 “Hallelujah.”
“As we have seen from the
protests of the last month
and even today, those
provoking violence
are part of the problem
and not part of the solution.”

Isaac and Jacob.
We gather here today
to thank you for the joy
of living and seeing this
glorious and historic day.”
