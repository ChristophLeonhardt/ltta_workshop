what is it this has to be one of the most bizarre lawsuits in Hollywood history an author is suing the studio behind the super successful conjuring franchise for nine hundred million dollars which is just slightly more than the films made at the box office the conjuring movies and the spin-off Annabelle tout themselves as being based on the true case files of the warrants warrants were a married pair of paranormal investigators gerald brittle wrote a book about them in 1980 called the demonologist brittle said the warren signed an agreement with him in 1978 stating that they aren't allowed to make or contract any works based on the same subject as Brittles book with anyone but him but in 1997 warner brothers signed an agreement with the Warrens for the rights to make movies based on their case files which brittle says violates his pre-existing contract with the warrants in 2015 brittle sent a cease-and-desist letter trying to fight the release of the conjuring 2 saying that he had the exclusive rights to the warrens case files warner brothers responded by saying the films weren't based on the demonologist but instead on historical facts that's where brittle and his legal team think they have a chance to beat Warner Brothers brittle says there's nothing factual about the Warrens Case Files because ghosts and witches aren't real and neither are dolls and murder people brittle and many other skeptics claim that the Warren's perpetuated a hoax for years Brittles lawyer said this to the extent the defendants movies are not based on historical facts they cannot claim they are protected by the fair use doctrine exemption to copyright in order to prove that the warrants findings are indeed historical facts warner brothers would have to make the biggest paranormal breakthrough in history and prove that a witch killed herself outside a farmhouse that evil spirits are real and that Annabelle is coming to get you we reached out to Warner Brothers but they declined to comment and at this point the lawsuit has been filed the Warner Brothers has yet receive it now
