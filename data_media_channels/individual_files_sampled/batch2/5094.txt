I won this district like by 22 points it's a lot that's why I'm here look at all those red hats Rick this guy should win easily and he's gonna win he's like Donald Trump wasn't satisfied with having won that district by 20 points so he had to exaggerate it to 22 but enough Trump voters in that district turned against Donald Trump Tuesday night to give the win in that special congressional election to the Democrat Connor Lam that's what happened in Alabama in the special Senate election in December when Donald Trump campaign for Roy Moore in the Democrat Doug Jones beat the Trump candidate Republicans have to be much more careful about inviting Donald Trump to campaign for them because in many states and districts Donald Trump is capable of doing more harm than good former New York Times executive editor Howell Raines who is from Alabama was an invaluable contributor to our coverage of the Alabama Senate race today in an NBC dot-com article Howell Raines wrote this about the Alabama and Pennsylvania special elections Connor lamb and Doug Jones come at Trump's political foundation the celebrated 40% base from different angles but they both demonstrate an important fact Trump's core voters are not as secure as he may hope indeed even in deep red Alabama key elements of the Trump base fell away like chips from a hammered block of stone if the base slides slides into the low 30s Trump's fragile coalition of angry white swing voters and habituated GOP loyalists loses its magic Howell Raines ends his piece with the question Republicans are surely asking after this week's loss if Trump's endorsements won't work in Alabama or Pittsburgh where will they work Howell Raines would be a great and invaluable political analyst even if he didn't now have homes in both Pennsylvania and Alabama but he does split his time these days between Pennsylvania and Alabama and so he is the perfect person to get the last word on this week's special election joining us now is Howell Raines former executive editor of the New York Times in an MSNBC contributor how what did you see happening Tuesday night in Pennsylvania well Lauritz taken together with the Alabama result I think it's brought us to a remarkable moment in the 2018 political year it's possible to place too much emphasis on off-year elections but these two taken together sent a powerful center signal I think one is first the drift among suburban Republicans who have since the Reagan days been reliably habitually voting for Republican candidates drifted away from the Trump base and I think that is a very important development the other thing that I think is equally important in Connor Lam and Doug Jones we have two young men who contrasted themselves with Trump in a number of ways and I think they are showing a way to that the Democratic Party has to look at as the kind of candidates they have to to recruit that is people who are calm who are empathic who seem more concerned with going to Washington as Connor Lam said to work on things like infrastructure in health care than to fight and these these types of candidates also tap into what I call the role model issue in my piece these young Democrats that we've seen in Alabama Pennsylvania before that the governor's race in Virginia our role models for young people and with all respect to President Trump there are many Americans who look at him and say is this the kind of person I want my son or daughter to grow up to be so I think we're really really at a if you like political drama if you like political theater indeed if you'd like to study the American presidency we won at one of the most fascinating points in my life town of covering politics howl in these districts and states where the Trump voter might swing back as we saw this week in Pennsylvania swing back to a Democrat some of them by the way swinging back to the first Democrat they voted for in over 20 years in some instances exactly but but if they are going to do that do you think it will be based more on what they're hearing on the policy side of what the Democratic candidates are saying or will it be more on the behavioral side just a tiring of the Donald Trump stage performances and looking for something like you say that is more of a role model someone who they can let their kids watch and without any worry about what the person might say yeah I think that there is rage fatigue in the country I think it's probably more important in Pennsylvania which is a more balanced political state than in Alabama where there was the odd business of the child molestation charge against the other candidate but I think in in both cases there's a policy element that goes hand-in-hand with the personality element it's it's completely wrong as Paul Ryan said and as the president said that Connor Lamb is some sort of trumpian in democratic clothing he he made it very clear he's for Obamacare he's not for the tax cut he's unhappy about the deficit that Trump is running up he is more moderate on the prospect of gun buying regulation and particularly he and Doug Jones both found a way to handle the hot-button issue of abortion by saying we personally do not have like the practice of abortion but we affirm the right of women to make their own healthcare decisions so I think that cluster of issues along with the behavior drama that we watch everyday in in the white ass and indeed are watching this evening as you were just saying I think those those things make a cluster of the concerns that that if I were trying to plan the Republican campaign in 2018 I would be worried about how all as you know there has been gerrymandering of congressional districts as long as there have been congressional districts just about and so but some are way crazier than others and this one the Pennsylvania 18th was jerem and gerrymandered to the point of illegality to the point of just gross illegality so found by the United States Supreme Court and so that means that the Republicans created a district in which was supposed to be impossible for a Democrat to win it's supposed to be candidate proof it doesn't matter how good the Democratic candidate is doesn't matter how bad the Republican candidate is and yet the Republican story on Wednesday morning was oh we had a bad candidate yeah yeah well I must say I'm have been around politics long enough to remember back in the years of the Kennedys and Nixon where there was even among these fierce competitors the kind of good sportsmanship now there's this grasping to find the reasons for defeat even if it means eating your own young so there's a graceless 'no smart that i think again i think its erosive from trump standing and i think the thing we need to watch closely is whether white independence in that basic we're talking about begin to show some signs of fracturing how arranged thank you very much for joining us again tonight really appreciate it always great
