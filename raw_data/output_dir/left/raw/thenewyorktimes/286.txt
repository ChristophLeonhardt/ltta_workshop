1
00:00:05,170 --> 00:00:07,560
“... I hope you will listen to many
brave and outspoken supporters

2
00:00:07,560 --> 00:00:08,970
of movements
like #MeToo

3
00:00:08,970 --> 00:00:10,830
and Time’s Up
and Never Again.

4
00:00:10,830 --> 00:00:11,999
It is positive change.

5
00:00:11,999 --> 00:00:13,160
This is a night for positivity.

6
00:00:18,290 --> 00:00:19,700
“A few years ago,
people were saying

7
00:00:19,700 --> 00:00:21,870
that Oscars were so white.

8
00:00:21,870 --> 00:00:24,230
And since then, some real
progress has been made.”

9
00:00:24,230 --> 00:00:26,730
“Mm-hmm. But when we
came out together,

10
00:00:26,730 --> 00:00:28,000
we know some of you
were thinking:

11
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,900
Are the Oscars too black now?”

12
00:00:36,040 --> 00:00:38,070
“From the 1960s to the present,

13
00:00:38,070 --> 00:00:42,240
we have both witnessed and
experienced so many changes.”

14
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:43,890
“The changes we
are witnessing

15
00:00:43,890 --> 00:00:46,710
are being driven
by the powerful sound

16
00:00:46,710 --> 00:00:51,750
of new voices, of different
voices, of our voices,

17
00:00:51,750 --> 00:00:53,880
joining together in
a mighty chorus

18
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:57,280
that is finally saying
Time’s Up.”

19
00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:01,470
“If I may be so honored to
have all the female nominees

20
00:01:01,470 --> 00:01:04,910
in every category stand
with me in this room tonight.

21
00:01:04,910 --> 00:01:09,060
The actors — Meryl if you do it,
everybody else will — come on.

22
00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:10,286
The filmmakers,

23
00:01:10,286 --> 00:01:11,353
the producers,

24
00:01:11,353 --> 00:01:12,840
the directors,

25
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:14,420
the writers,

26
00:01:14,420 --> 00:01:16,420
the cinematographers,

27
00:01:16,420 --> 00:01:18,010
the composers,

28
00:01:18,010 --> 00:01:19,860
the songwriters,

29
00:01:19,860 --> 00:01:22,050
the designers ...”

30
00:01:22,050 --> 00:01:24,240
“I have two words to
leave with you tonight,

31
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:28,180
ladies and gentlemen:
‘inclusion rider.’ ”

32
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:31,740
“I’m from Kenya.”

33
00:01:31,740 --> 00:01:34,110
“And I am from
Pakistan and Iowa.”

34
00:01:39,525 --> 00:01:44,505
♪ “It’s time we put our
differences aside ...” ♪

35
00:01:48,860 --> 00:01:51,050
“To my husband, Ryan ...”

36
00:01:51,050 --> 00:01:54,040
“... and most especially
my wife, my rock, Kori Rae.”

37
00:02:01,370 --> 00:02:03,040
“I stopped writing this movie
about 20 times

38
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:04,354
because I thought
it was impossible.

39
00:02:04,354 --> 00:02:05,770
I thought it wasn’t
going to work.

40
00:02:05,770 --> 00:02:07,930
I thought no one would
ever make this movie.

41
00:02:07,930 --> 00:02:09,788
But I kept coming
back to it,

42
00:02:09,788 --> 00:02:11,920
because I knew if someone
let me make this movie,

43
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:13,170
that people would hear it.

44
00:02:13,170 --> 00:02:14,170
And people would see it.”

45
00:02:14,170 --> 00:02:17,210
“The Oscar goes to ... [laughs]”

46
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:35,190
“I am an immigrant,

47
00:02:35,190 --> 00:02:37,000
like Alfonso and Alejandro,
my compadres,

48
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
and like many, many of you.

49
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,570
And in the last 25 years,
I’ve been living in a country

50
00:02:42,570 --> 00:02:44,250
all of our own.

51
00:02:44,250 --> 00:02:46,500
Part of it is here.
Part of it is in Europe.

52
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:47,500
Part of it is everywhere.

53
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:48,730
Because I think that
the greatest thing

54
00:02:48,730 --> 00:02:51,040
our art does
and our industry does

55
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:53,470
is to erase the
lines in the sand.

56
00:02:53,470 --> 00:02:54,960
We should continue
doing that,

57
00:02:54,960 --> 00:00:00,000
when the world tells us
to make them deeper.”
