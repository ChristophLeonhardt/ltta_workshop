1
00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:01,210
- Hey, YouTube world.

2
00:00:01,210 --> 00:00:02,043
It's me, Evelyn.

3
00:00:02,043 --> 00:00:03,220
I'm excited for this one.

4
00:00:03,220 --> 00:00:04,180
I'm excited.

5
00:00:04,180 --> 00:00:05,943
I'm a little nervous,

6
00:00:06,870 --> 00:00:08,115
and I don't know why.

7
00:00:08,115 --> 00:00:11,350
I thoroughly enjoy reading memoirs.

8
00:00:11,350 --> 00:00:14,195
The art and the skill of telling

9
00:00:14,195 --> 00:00:17,620
your own story is very powerful.

10
00:00:17,620 --> 00:00:20,640
How does one tell one's own story?

11
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:23,487
How does one talk about oneself?

12
00:00:23,487 --> 00:00:24,891
And I have many memoirs,

13
00:00:24,891 --> 00:00:26,800
and I think all of y'all watching this

14
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:28,840
also have lots of memoirs.

15
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:31,713
I have Tumblr posts from when I was 19.

16
00:00:31,713 --> 00:00:34,183
I have cassette tapes of me

17
00:00:34,183 --> 00:00:37,840
and my mom singing Sunday
school songs together.

18
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:40,750
I told her to hush though,
'cause it was my solo.

19
00:00:40,750 --> 00:00:41,619
Photographs.

20
00:00:41,619 --> 00:00:45,130
I have albums and albums of photos

21
00:00:45,130 --> 00:00:46,670
that my parents have taken

22
00:00:46,670 --> 00:00:49,765
that really just show my personality.

23
00:00:49,765 --> 00:00:53,185
Hit, hit, hit, hit.

24
00:00:53,185 --> 00:00:54,743
Pizza.

25
00:00:55,640 --> 00:00:57,470
I even have this YouTube channel.

26
00:00:57,470 --> 00:01:00,571
Hours and hours of footage
that represent years

27
00:01:00,571 --> 00:01:02,976
and years of my life and my thoughts.

28
00:01:02,976 --> 00:01:06,170
I can see, like, oh my gosh,
I used to be a skinny neck,

29
00:01:06,170 --> 00:01:09,130
big forehead, no eyebrow having girl,

30
00:01:09,130 --> 00:01:10,765
and now I'm just like a thick neck,

31
00:01:10,765 --> 00:01:14,540
still got a forehead,
illustrate my eyebrows woman.

32
00:01:14,540 --> 00:01:15,373
You feel me?

33
00:01:15,373 --> 00:01:16,206
Progress.

34
00:01:16,206 --> 00:01:18,930
And I also have my diary.

35
00:01:18,930 --> 00:01:20,333
Journal.

36
00:01:20,333 --> 00:01:22,350
Book of secrets.

37
00:01:22,350 --> 00:01:25,798
But I think in a fit of teenage angst,

38
00:01:25,798 --> 00:01:30,798
I threw away a lot of
my childhood diaries.

39
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:33,290
What was I thinking?

40
00:01:33,290 --> 00:01:36,698
But what I did find was ripped out pages

41
00:01:36,698 --> 00:01:40,200
from one of my earliest journals.

42
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:43,740
I was maybe nine years old, maybe 10,

43
00:01:43,740 --> 00:01:48,740
and I don't know why
Rage Evelyn saved these.

44
00:01:50,382 --> 00:01:52,119
But it's what I have.

45
00:01:52,119 --> 00:01:54,833
And in this video I would like to

46
00:01:54,833 --> 00:01:59,661
read these diary entries aloud to you.

47
00:01:59,661 --> 00:02:01,659
Let's begin.

48
00:02:01,659 --> 00:02:05,840
October 11th, 1999.

49
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:08,669
I was nine.

50
00:02:08,669 --> 00:02:11,321
Dear Diary, today was good.

51
00:02:11,321 --> 00:02:13,780
I had a good day.

52
00:02:13,780 --> 00:02:14,613
We get it!

53
00:02:14,613 --> 00:02:17,747
The history test was moved to next week.

54
00:02:17,747 --> 00:02:19,053
Amen?!

55
00:02:19,053 --> 00:02:22,653
I had a stomachache all through PE.

56
00:02:22,653 --> 00:02:24,547
Lunch was good.

57
00:02:24,547 --> 00:02:27,238
Catherine's parents came today.

58
00:02:27,238 --> 00:02:29,334
Who is Catherine?

59
00:02:29,334 --> 00:02:31,360
I had homework.

60
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:32,193
Bible.

61
00:02:32,193 --> 00:02:35,370
I went to a private
Christian elementary school.

62
00:02:35,370 --> 00:02:38,110
Bible, math and spelling.

63
00:02:38,110 --> 00:02:39,486
Mom made dinner.

64
00:02:39,486 --> 00:02:40,779
Yum.

65
00:02:40,779 --> 00:02:43,228
I had to repeat homework.

66
00:02:43,228 --> 00:02:44,697
Damn.

67
00:02:44,697 --> 00:02:46,480
I played.

68
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:47,810
I'm in bed.

69
00:02:47,810 --> 00:02:49,232
Well, bye.

70
00:02:49,232 --> 00:02:50,880
Signed, Evelyn.

71
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:53,560
Hold up, I signed it, hold up.

72
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:55,090
Alright, we're nine years old.

73
00:02:55,090 --> 00:02:56,926
We're using very basic sentences.

74
00:02:56,926 --> 00:03:01,600
We are not offering any
sort of descriptive...

75
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:03,534
no adjectives.

76
00:03:03,534 --> 00:03:07,855
We jump to November 28th, 1999.

77
00:03:07,855 --> 00:03:09,773
Dear Diary, I had a good day.

78
00:03:09,773 --> 00:03:11,759
At least I be having good days.

79
00:03:11,759 --> 00:03:13,503
I went to church.

80
00:03:15,140 --> 00:03:16,573
David was there.

81
00:03:16,573 --> 00:03:17,406
Ah!

82
00:03:18,350 --> 00:03:20,090
Oh no!

83
00:03:20,090 --> 00:03:21,390
Did I like David?

84
00:03:21,390 --> 00:03:22,223
Oh no.

85
00:03:22,223 --> 00:03:23,812
Okay, hold up.

86
00:03:23,812 --> 00:03:24,700
Who is David?

87
00:03:24,700 --> 00:03:26,600
I ate a big lunch.

88
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:28,040
Steve went to sleep.

89
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:29,893
Okay, so Steve is my younger brother.

90
00:03:29,893 --> 00:03:34,450
So if this is 1999, he's four years old.

91
00:03:34,450 --> 00:03:37,270
So maybe it's relevant that

92
00:03:37,270 --> 00:03:39,420
I'm saying the baby finally asleep.

93
00:03:39,420 --> 00:03:41,030
Steve went to sleep.

94
00:03:41,030 --> 00:03:42,600
I went outside.

95
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:45,305
We played professors.

96
00:03:45,305 --> 00:03:48,343
I made my own software.

97
00:03:50,110 --> 00:03:51,310
Look at us playing pretend.

98
00:03:51,310 --> 00:03:52,340
Okay.

99
00:03:52,340 --> 00:03:54,843
In the morning, I wrote a story.

100
00:03:58,095 --> 00:03:59,728
I was always me.

101
00:03:59,728 --> 00:04:02,440
Dad went out to buy something.

102
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:04,635
Probably RadioShack, to be honest.

103
00:04:04,635 --> 00:04:06,122
Remember RadioShack?

104
00:04:06,122 --> 00:04:07,960
We had dinner.

105
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:08,793
Yum.

106
00:04:08,793 --> 00:04:11,740
I had a hole in my school shorts.

107
00:04:11,740 --> 00:04:13,082
We had uniforms.

108
00:04:13,082 --> 00:04:14,484
Ah!

109
00:04:14,484 --> 00:04:17,192
Mom sewed it back together.

110
00:04:17,192 --> 00:04:20,762
I still have to pick a book.

111
00:04:20,762 --> 00:04:22,895
I know God.

112
00:04:22,895 --> 00:04:24,611
I underlined it.

113
00:04:24,611 --> 00:04:29,126
I know God will help me with the report.

114
00:04:29,126 --> 00:04:30,494
(gospel music)

115
00:04:30,494 --> 00:04:32,510
(speaking in tongues)

116
00:04:32,510 --> 00:04:33,343
Watch.

117
00:04:33,343 --> 00:04:34,176
I underlined God.

118
00:04:35,948 --> 00:04:36,781
Mhm.

119
00:04:36,781 --> 00:04:37,642
God!

120
00:04:37,642 --> 00:04:38,475
Shondo!

121
00:04:39,659 --> 00:04:41,428
(laughing)

122
00:04:41,428 --> 00:04:44,880
July 17th, 2000.

123
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:47,038
Alright, so we survived Y2K,

124
00:04:47,038 --> 00:04:48,980
and I am still nine.

125
00:04:48,980 --> 00:04:51,107
I turn 10 the next month.

126
00:04:51,107 --> 00:04:51,940
(menacing classical music)

127
00:04:51,940 --> 00:04:55,010
Dear Diary, I have to tell you something.

128
00:04:55,010 --> 00:04:58,053
Steve is a crybaby.

129
00:05:00,890 --> 00:05:02,113
He's a baby.

130
00:05:03,430 --> 00:05:05,177
He was jumping on my bed,

131
00:05:05,177 --> 00:05:07,586
and I told him to get down.

132
00:05:07,586 --> 00:05:10,665
He just jumped higher.

133
00:05:10,665 --> 00:05:12,171
(laughing)

134
00:05:12,171 --> 00:05:15,420
I don't want to say the rest.

135
00:05:15,420 --> 00:05:17,320
Signed, Evelyn.

136
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:22,320
And then in crayon, Steve is a baby.

137
00:05:22,900 --> 00:05:25,110
I said I don't wanna say the rest, okay?

138
00:05:25,110 --> 00:05:26,883
And incriminate myself.

139
00:05:28,700 --> 00:05:30,840
March 22nd, 2001.

140
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:32,724
Dear Diary, wuz up?

141
00:05:33,816 --> 00:05:34,773
Wuz. Up.

142
00:05:34,773 --> 00:05:37,722
I feel bad right now, so
I'm gonna make this fast.

143
00:05:37,722 --> 00:05:40,349
I forgot my assignment tablet at school.

144
00:05:40,349 --> 00:05:42,844
Now my dad is going to be angry with me,

145
00:05:42,844 --> 00:05:46,001
and I will have to write
stuff a million times.

146
00:05:46,001 --> 00:05:47,260
(laughing)

147
00:05:47,260 --> 00:05:49,030
I know I shouldn't forget stuff,

148
00:05:49,030 --> 00:05:51,371
but it happens, you know?

149
00:05:51,371 --> 00:05:54,040
Now I'll get a mark too.

150
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:56,455
Will I ever get anything right?

151
00:05:56,455 --> 00:05:58,796
I just cried before I started writing.

152
00:05:58,796 --> 00:06:03,169
Everyone thinks of me
as a happy, smart girl,

153
00:06:03,169 --> 00:06:07,390
but sometimes I feel like nothing.

154
00:06:07,390 --> 00:06:09,145
Well, bye.

155
00:06:09,145 --> 00:06:11,990
Bad day, Evelyn.

156
00:06:11,990 --> 00:06:13,440
Evelyn.

157
00:06:14,490 --> 00:06:16,590
You are a happy, smart girl.

158
00:06:16,590 --> 00:06:20,847
On the back here, I have
something, I think a pledge

159
00:06:20,847 --> 00:06:24,180
that says I promise not
to eat any ice cream

160
00:06:24,180 --> 00:06:29,092
or junk of any kind except
when it's meal time.

161
00:06:29,092 --> 00:06:32,187
Signed, my full, I put my full name.

162
00:06:32,187 --> 00:06:34,393
I think I was feeling a
little self-conscious.

163
00:06:34,393 --> 00:06:36,070
I think this was around the time

164
00:06:36,070 --> 00:06:38,399
I was eating way too many Pop-Tarts.

165
00:06:38,399 --> 00:06:40,222
I was feeling a little bit fluffy.

166
00:06:40,222 --> 00:06:44,713
Feel like a little like I
need to make a resolution.

167
00:06:44,713 --> 00:06:47,033
So that doesn't have a date on it.

168
00:06:48,690 --> 00:06:51,650
June 6th, 2001.

169
00:06:51,650 --> 00:06:53,610
And I put a scale of the day.

170
00:06:53,610 --> 00:06:56,283
I rated the day an 82.

171
00:06:58,570 --> 00:07:01,523
Dear Diary, how's everything going?

172
00:07:02,767 --> 00:07:05,450
I got an...

173
00:07:05,450 --> 00:07:06,849
invitation.

174
00:07:06,849 --> 00:07:08,730
Woo, I spelled that wrong.

175
00:07:08,730 --> 00:07:12,203
I got an invitation to Amy's glamor party.

176
00:07:13,170 --> 00:07:14,159
I might go,

177
00:07:15,017 --> 00:07:17,420
but right now, I'm crying.

178
00:07:17,420 --> 00:07:19,339
It's just not fair.

179
00:07:19,339 --> 00:07:22,099
This is one of the reasons why.

180
00:07:22,099 --> 00:07:23,510
Quotes.

181
00:07:23,510 --> 00:07:25,689
"Evelyn, make your bed now."

182
00:07:25,689 --> 00:07:29,173
"Oh, Steve, I made your bed for you."

183
00:07:30,850 --> 00:07:32,511
That is what my mom says.

184
00:07:32,511 --> 00:07:36,073
Sometimes when he calls me dumb,

185
00:07:38,590 --> 00:07:43,590
and I go tell on him, I
have to apologize to him.

186
00:07:44,275 --> 00:07:46,260
I underlined that.

187
00:07:46,260 --> 00:07:49,505
It seems like I did something wrong,

188
00:07:49,505 --> 00:07:52,880
but you have to remember, I didn't.

189
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:55,471
I am so angry right now.

190
00:07:55,471 --> 00:07:57,580
I'll write later.

191
00:07:57,580 --> 00:07:59,275
Signed.

192
00:07:59,275 --> 00:08:01,130
And I signed my middle name.

193
00:08:01,130 --> 00:08:03,860
My brother, five, calling me dumb.

194
00:08:03,860 --> 00:08:05,080
That's rude.

195
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:07,170
I'm mad all over again.

196
00:08:07,170 --> 00:08:09,080
Ooh, love it.

197
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:11,970
June 12th, 2001.

198
00:08:11,970 --> 00:08:15,250
Dear Diary, hi.

199
00:08:15,250 --> 00:08:18,027
It's 10:16 p.m.

200
00:08:18,027 --> 00:08:20,068
and I'm heading to bed.

201
00:08:20,068 --> 00:08:22,160
Is that a late bedtime?

202
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:23,793
I feel like that's a little late.

203
00:08:25,140 --> 00:08:26,840
I had a wonderful day.

204
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:29,583
Mom let me spend my money.

205
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:33,293
I bought four packs of gum,

206
00:08:34,730 --> 00:08:39,203
chips, soda and a notebook.

207
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:41,489
Well, that's my day.

208
00:08:41,489 --> 00:08:43,100
Bye.

209
00:08:43,100 --> 00:08:45,600
Signed, reclaiming my middle name.

210
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:47,910
I stand by those purchases, I do.

211
00:08:47,910 --> 00:08:50,450
Ooh, speaking of chips and soda,

212
00:08:50,450 --> 00:08:55,040
I found another weight
loss pledge, unfortunately.

213
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:57,282
I will go on a diet

214
00:08:57,282 --> 00:09:01,388
and do as many sit-ups
as I can in one day.

215
00:09:01,388 --> 00:09:02,497
Aw.

216
00:09:02,497 --> 00:09:07,471
Tomorrow, July 26th, I will run from

217
00:09:07,471 --> 00:09:10,862
my house

218
00:09:10,862 --> 00:09:11,854
and back.

219
00:09:11,854 --> 00:09:13,046
To where?

220
00:09:13,046 --> 00:09:17,286
I am determined to lose weight.

221
00:09:17,286 --> 00:09:21,431
I want to be skinny again,

222
00:09:21,431 --> 00:09:24,140
but not so skinny.

223
00:09:24,140 --> 00:09:25,441
Signed, me.

224
00:09:26,941 --> 00:09:30,360
Is it bad that I still wanna lose weight?

225
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:33,179
And now that I have shared
with you the vulnerable

226
00:09:33,179 --> 00:09:36,355
inner workings of baby Evelyn's mind,

227
00:09:36,355 --> 00:09:38,370
a word from our sponsor.

228
00:09:38,370 --> 00:09:40,310
Shout-out to Audible for
sponsoring today's video.

229
00:09:40,310 --> 00:09:43,095
Audible has the largest
selection of audiobooks.

230
00:09:43,095 --> 00:09:45,584
They got audio fitness programs now.

231
00:09:45,584 --> 00:09:48,562
And Audible Originals,
which are exclusive titles

232
00:09:48,562 --> 00:09:51,551
brought to you by storytellers
from different industries

233
00:09:51,551 --> 00:09:55,170
like theater, journalism and literature.

234
00:09:55,170 --> 00:09:56,718
Right now for a limited time you can get

235
00:09:56,718 --> 00:09:59,445
three months of Audible for $6.95,

236
00:09:59,445 --> 00:10:02,246
which is more than half the original cost.

237
00:10:02,246 --> 00:10:04,811
So give the gift of listening
to a great book to yourself

238
00:10:04,811 --> 00:10:07,264
or to someone else on your list this year.

239
00:10:07,264 --> 00:10:09,297
Visit Audible.com/Evelyn

240
00:10:09,297 --> 00:10:12,700
or text Evelyn to 500-500 to get started.

241
00:10:12,700 --> 00:10:14,096
Members get one audiobook,

242
00:10:14,096 --> 00:10:17,090
plus two Audible Originals per month now.

243
00:10:17,090 --> 00:10:18,584
Y'all already know I use Audible

244
00:10:18,584 --> 00:10:21,733
almost exclusively to listen to memoirs.

245
00:10:21,733 --> 00:10:25,490
I love hearing people
tell their own life story.

246
00:10:25,490 --> 00:10:28,309
I suggest you listen to
The Last Black Unicorn

247
00:10:28,309 --> 00:10:29,800
by Tiffany Haddish.

248
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:32,570
Yes, girl, she narrates her own book.

249
00:10:32,570 --> 00:10:33,980
She ready.

250
00:10:33,980 --> 00:10:35,900
All of that is in there, okay?

251
00:10:35,900 --> 00:10:38,456
The things this woman has been through

252
00:10:38,456 --> 00:10:42,302
and is still somehow able to laugh

253
00:10:42,302 --> 00:10:45,420
and crack jokes is beyond.

254
00:10:45,420 --> 00:10:49,750
Did y'all know she couldn't
really read until high school?

255
00:10:49,750 --> 00:10:52,863
I'm writing my own
story as a nine year old

256
00:10:52,863 --> 00:10:53,696
and--

257
00:10:55,555 --> 00:10:56,971
*mind blown*

258
00:10:56,971 --> 00:10:58,597
I usually got Audible
running in the background

259
00:10:58,597 --> 00:11:01,430
as I am stuck in traffic or doing chores,

260
00:11:01,430 --> 00:11:03,936
and there were a couple times
listening to Tiffany Haddish

261
00:11:03,936 --> 00:11:06,087
where I had to stop what I was doing,

262
00:11:06,087 --> 00:11:09,243
rewind, like, run it back.

263
00:11:09,243 --> 00:11:11,546
Did that really just happen to you?

264
00:11:11,546 --> 00:11:13,943
So to get started on your
three months of Audible,

265
00:11:13,943 --> 00:11:18,780
visit Audible.com/Evelyn
or text Evelyn to 500-500.

266
00:11:18,780 --> 00:11:20,520
You can select my pick,

267
00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:22,590
Tiffany Haddish's The Last Black Unicorn,

268
00:11:22,590 --> 00:11:24,420
or you can choose whichever
audiobook you wanna read.

269
00:11:24,420 --> 00:11:26,700
And the dope thing is, it's yours to keep,

270
00:11:26,700 --> 00:11:28,930
even if you don't
continue your membership.

271
00:11:28,930 --> 00:11:30,160
'Cause Audible ain't trifling.

272
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:32,460
In the comments below, let me know.

273
00:11:32,460 --> 00:11:34,455
Do you keep a dairy or nah?

274
00:11:34,455 --> 00:11:35,892
Why or why not?

275
00:11:35,892 --> 00:11:38,037
And I will see you on
the Internet somewhere.

276
00:11:38,037 --> 00:11:39,140
Bye.

277
00:11:39,140 --> 00:00:00,000
(upbeat electronic music)
