1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,190
I guess I'll start<font color="#E5E5E5"> off by expressing my</font>

2
00:00:02,190 --> 00:00:04,440
view on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> British national party the</font>

3
00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:07,830
BMP I find them racist I find them

4
00:00:07,830 --> 00:00:11,010
repulsive and I would never ever vote

5
00:00:11,010 --> 00:00:13,019
for them so having<font color="#E5E5E5"> such a stance it</font>

6
00:00:13,019 --> 00:00:14,790
could be<font color="#E5E5E5"> therefore assumed that I would</font>

7
00:00:14,790 --> 00:00:17,190
never take sides with this political

8
00:00:17,190 --> 00:00:19,949
party I'd like<font color="#E5E5E5"> to say so but this year I</font>

9
00:00:19,949 --> 00:00:22,470
found myself doing so for the first time

10
00:00:22,470 --> 00:00:25,230
and it's all thanks to the anti BNP

11
00:00:25,230 --> 00:00:27,630
protesters who have angered me with

12
00:00:27,630 --> 00:00:30,000
their hypocrisy it started earlier this

13
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,610
year when<font color="#CCCCCC"> Nick Griffin the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> BNP leader</font>

14
00:00:32,610 --> 00:00:35,219
held a news conference at Westminster

15
00:00:35,219 --> 00:00:38,460
after<font color="#E5E5E5"> being elected as a member of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

16
00:00:38,460 --> 00:00:41,579
European Parliament the<font color="#CCCCCC"> uaf the united</font>

against fascism group swarm the area

18
00:00:44,219 --> 00:00:47,670
during<font color="#E5E5E5"> this talk he was giving and began</font>

19
00:00:47,670 --> 00:00:49,980
pelting him with eggs this<font color="#E5E5E5"> forced the</font>

20
00:00:49,980 --> 00:00:52,230
BMPs who flee the area but<font color="#E5E5E5"> even when</font>

00:00:52,230 --> 00:00:54,390
getting<font color="#E5E5E5"> in their cars the protesters</font>

22
00:00:54,390 --> 00:00:56,850
felt it necessary to smack the cars with

23
00:00:56,850 --> 00:00:59,370
their placards to see exactly<font color="#E5E5E5"> what</font>

24
00:00:59,370 --> 00:01:01,050
happened<font color="#E5E5E5"> that day then just click this</font>

25
00:01:01,050 --> 00:01:03,930
annotation to view the video what got me

26
00:01:03,930 --> 00:01:06,090
taking sides with the BMP was that they

27
00:01:06,090 --> 00:01:08,220
<font color="#CCCCCC">actually were democratically elected</font>

28
00:01:08,220 --> 00:01:11,180
which is to their credit and then this

29
00:01:11,180 --> 00:01:14,100
protest group comes along being

30
00:01:14,100 --> 00:01:16,500
aggressive being violent<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you know</font>

31
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:18,360
what example are they showing with the

32
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:20,159
way they're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to what what is your</font>

33
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:22,560
attitude<font color="#E5E5E5"> towards free speech well we</font>

34
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:24,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">don't believe in free speech for fashion</font>

35
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:25,770
and then when they<font color="#CCCCCC"> were questions on</font>

36
00:01:25,770 --> 00:01:27,689
<font color="#E5E5E5">their own actions I just heard nothing</font>

37
00:01:27,689 --> 00:01:30,090
compelling about it whatsoever so if you

38
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:32,430
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to hear some wise words from Donna</font>

39
00:01:32,430 --> 00:01:35,130
Guthrie from the<font color="#CCCCCC"> uaf then click this</font>

40
00:01:35,130 --> 00:01:37,470
annotation to see that video where she's

41
00:01:37,470 --> 00:01:39,750
interviewed on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the BBC the way I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> see it</font>

42
00:01:39,750 --> 00:01:41,820
is if they want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do the right thing</font>

43
00:01:41,820 --> 00:01:43,229
they<font color="#E5E5E5"> should be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> doing something</font>

44
00:01:43,229 --> 00:01:45,570
constructive which is giving the people

45
00:01:45,570 --> 00:01:48,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">that would normally vote for the BMP to</font>

46
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:50,610
have a better alternative if they're

47
00:01:50,610 --> 00:01:52,979
preaching about democracy then surely

48
00:01:52,979 --> 00:01:54,420
they should be exercising it within

49
00:01:54,420 --> 00:01:56,430
their own argument because as soon as

50
00:01:56,430 --> 00:01:59,100
you go<font color="#CCCCCC"> into hypocricy your argument</font>

51
00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:01,920
falls tonight on question time the BNP

52
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:03,689
leader<font color="#CCCCCC"> nick griffing will be appearing</font>

53
00:02:03,689 --> 00:02:06,180
and already it's made a lot of

54
00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:09,239
controversy in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the press because</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> many</font>

55
00:02:09,239 --> 00:02:11,310
<font color="#CCCCCC">people believe he doesn't have a right</font>

56
00:02:11,310 --> 00:02:13,050
to be<font color="#CCCCCC"> there</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> unless you're someone who is</font>

57
00:02:13,050 --> 00:02:13,600
against

58
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:15,820
ma cracy then you should accept that for

59
00:02:15,820 --> 00:02:18,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">someone who is democratically elected</font>

60
00:02:18,100 --> 00:02:20,440
that he has a right to go on there and

61
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:23,230
take questions from the public in terms

62
00:02:23,230 --> 00:02:25,780
of the VMP now<font color="#E5E5E5"> next week on your program</font>

other views and communities across the

then have a negative impact creating

88
00:03:12,220 --> 00:03:15,340
tension creating for the babies what

89
00:03:15,340 --> 00:03:17,350
frustrates<font color="#CCCCCC"> me most about people like</font>

90
00:03:17,350 --> 00:03:19,630
this guy is that they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing their own</font>

91
00:03:19,630 --> 00:03:21,700
cause of disservice and I mean this

92
00:03:21,700 --> 00:03:24,160
frustration that he then create some

93
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:27,580
people like me is someone who would not

94
00:03:27,580 --> 00:03:29,500
actually usually want to be associated

95
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:32,950
with taking sides with the BMP is now

96
00:03:32,950 --> 00:03:35,260
doing so because I'm defending him with

97
00:03:35,260 --> 00:03:36,730
making the points that I've been<font color="#E5E5E5"> making</font>

00:03:36,730 --> 00:03:39,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">in this video so if you're someone who</font>

doesn't like the BMP try doing st.

100
00:03:41,550 --> 00:03:43,960
constructive and stop giving<font color="#CCCCCC"> me a reason</font>

101
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:46,630
for taking their side ever again and i'm

102
00:03:46,630 --> 00:03:47,800
sure this conversation will continue

103
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:49,930
after the show has taken place tonight

104
00:03:49,930 --> 00:03:51,970
