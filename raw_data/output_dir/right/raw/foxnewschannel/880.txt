1
00:00:00,171 --> 00:00:04,042
IS COOPERATING AND KEEP HIM

2
00:00:04,042 --> 00:00:05,476
HERE.

3
00:00:05,476 --> 00:00:08,646
THANKS FOR BEING WITH US.

4
00:00:08,646 --> 00:00:11,716
JOINING US WITH MORE ARE THE

5
00:00:11,716 --> 00:00:13,985
AUTHORS OF THE BOOK, LET TRUMP

6
00:00:13,985 --> 00:00:16,354
BE TRUMP, THE INSIDE STORY OF

7
00:00:16,354 --> 00:00:21,025
HIS RISE TO THE PRESIDENCY.

8
00:00:21,025 --> 00:00:23,795
FOX NEWS NEW CONTRIBUTOR AND

9
00:00:23,795 --> 00:00:25,563
FORM TRUMP CAMPAIGN MANAGER.

10
00:00:25,563 --> 00:00:27,332
THE INSPECTOR GENERAL'S REPORT

11
00:00:27,332 --> 00:00:28,533
WAS SAD.

12
00:00:28,533 --> 00:00:30,668
I HAD SEEN AND FOLLOWED CLOSELY

13
00:00:30,668 --> 00:00:32,403
FOR SO MANY MONTHS ALL OF THE

14
00:00:32,403 --> 00:00:34,172
WRONGS AND ALL OF THE BIASES

15
00:00:34,172 --> 00:00:36,407
THAT WERE SO OBVIOUS.

16
00:00:36,407 --> 00:00:39,310
THEN IN THE END, AFTER THE HUGE

17
00:00:39,310 --> 00:00:41,279
REPORT WE GOT.

18
00:00:41,279 --> 00:00:42,814
THEY KEPT THEIR PERSONAL BIASES

19
00:00:42,814 --> 00:00:43,481
AT THE DOOR.

20
00:00:43,481 --> 00:00:44,949
I DON'T WANT TO SPEND A LOT OF

21
00:00:44,949 --> 00:00:45,383
TIME ON.

22
00:00:45,383 --> 00:00:46,784
THIS BECAUSE I WANT TO TALK

23
00:00:46,784 --> 00:00:47,752
ABOUT THE GOOD STUFF THE

24
00:00:47,752 --> 00:00:49,621
PRESIDENT IS DOING.

25
00:00:49,621 --> 00:00:51,956
DAVID YOUR TAKE?

26
00:00:51,956 --> 00:00:54,692
>> WELL, FIRST OF ALL, AGENT

27
00:00:54,692 --> 00:00:56,761
STRZOK NEEDS TO BE FIRED

28
00:00:56,761 --> 00:00:58,296
IMMEDIATELY.

29
00:00:58,296 --> 00:00:59,931
HE WAS INVOLVED IN THE HILLARY

30
00:00:59,931 --> 00:01:05,970
CLINTON INTERVIEW AND IN HUMA

31
00:01:05,970 --> 00:01:07,905
ABEDIN'S INTERVIEW AND MIKE

32
00:01:07,905 --> 00:01:08,439
FLYNN'S INTERVIEW.

33
00:01:08,439 --> 00:01:09,774
THIS IS OUTRAGEOUS HE IS THE

34
00:01:09,774 --> 00:01:12,543
CENTER OF THIS.

35
00:01:12,543 --> 00:01:15,980
HE IS CLEARLY BIASSED AND HATED

36
00:01:15,980 --> 00:01:17,515
THIS PRESIDENT AND STILL DOES TO

37
00:01:17,515 --> 00:01:18,049
THIS DAY.

38
00:01:18,049 --> 00:01:19,917
IT'S OUTRAGEOUS HE IS STILL

39
00:01:19,917 --> 00:01:20,852
EMPLOYED BY THE FBI.

40
00:01:20,852 --> 00:01:23,054
DID THE JUDGE WHO SHOULD THE

41
00:01:23,054 --> 00:01:25,957
FISA WARRANT KNOW HE WAS

42
00:01:25,957 --> 00:01:26,557
INVOLVED?

43
00:01:26,557 --> 00:01:30,561
WAS HE INVOLVED WITH LEAKING THE

44
00:01:30,561 --> 00:01:32,263
MANAFORT INFORMATION?

45
00:01:32,263 --> 00:01:33,431
2 YEARS AGO -- THIS

46
00:01:33,431 --> 00:01:34,332
INVESTIGATION HAS BEEN GOING ON

47
00:01:34,332 --> 00:01:35,967
2 YEARS IN AUGUST.

48
00:01:35,967 --> 00:01:37,101
HE WAS INVOLVED.

49
00:01:37,101 --> 00:01:38,369
11 DAYS LATER.

50
00:01:38,369 --> 00:01:40,972
WE KNOW THAT THERE WAS A LEAK OF

51
00:01:40,972 --> 00:01:43,341
THE MANAFORT INFORMATION.

52
00:01:43,341 --> 00:01:45,677
THIS IS A VERY BAD GROUP WITHIN

53
00:01:45,677 --> 00:01:48,413
THE FBI THAT HAS GIVEN THEM

54
00:01:48,413 --> 00:01:48,713
THIS.

55
00:01:48,713 --> 00:01:53,584
>> WE ALL KNOW THIS.

56
00:01:53,584 --> 00:01:56,888
WHAT DAVID SAID IS NOTHING THAT

57
00:01:56,888 --> 00:01:58,589
NOT OBVIOUS.

58
00:01:58,589 --> 00:02:00,558
YET TONIGHT PAUL MANAFORT WAS

59
00:02:00,558 --> 00:02:01,259
ORDERED TO JAIL.

60
00:02:01,259 --> 00:02:04,495
THIS GUY DID NOT WORK FOR THE

61
00:02:04,495 --> 00:02:04,762
FBI.

62
00:02:04,762 --> 00:02:07,732
HE WAS NOT BIASSED OR HANDLING

63
00:02:07,732 --> 00:02:08,366
HILLARY CLINTON AND THE

64
00:02:08,366 --> 00:02:10,368
ANTI-TRUMP AND EXPOSING HIS

65
00:02:10,368 --> 00:02:11,068
BIASES.

66
00:02:11,068 --> 00:02:12,503
MANAFORT IS GOING TO JAIL.

67
00:02:12,503 --> 00:02:14,806
HE HAS A $10 MILLION BOND.

68
00:02:14,806 --> 00:02:18,810
HOW DO YOU LEVEL THIS OUT IN

69
00:02:18,810 --> 00:02:22,180
YOUR MIND THAT WE'VE GOT SUCH A

70
00:02:22,180 --> 00:02:22,847
GREAT SYSTEM?

71
00:02:22,847 --> 00:02:24,716
>> THE REAL PROBLEM WE HAVE.

72
00:02:24,716 --> 00:02:25,817
THE INSPECTOR GENERAL'S REPORT

73
00:02:25,817 --> 00:02:28,252
WAS VERY CLEAR ABOUT ONE THING

74
00:02:28,252 --> 00:02:30,555
WHICH THE MAINSTREAM MEDIA

75
00:02:30,555 --> 00:02:32,990
REFUSES TO COVER.

76
00:02:32,990 --> 00:02:35,760
HILLARY CLINTON TOOK CLASSIFIED

77
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:40,064
EMAILS ON AN UNCLASSIFIED SERVER

78
00:02:40,064 --> 00:02:42,633
AND THEY WERE HACKED OR

79
00:02:42,633 --> 00:02:47,805
ACCESSIBLE BY A FOREIGN ENTHIT.

80
00:02:47,805 --> 00:02:48,906
-- ENTITY.

81
00:02:48,906 --> 00:02:49,841
THINK EVERYTHING YOU WANT ABOUT

82
00:02:49,841 --> 00:02:50,308
PAUL MANAFORT.

83
00:02:50,308 --> 00:02:55,913
WE ARE NOT THE BEST OF FRIENDS

84
00:02:55,913 --> 00:02:58,116
BUT THE FACT THAT PAUL MANAFORT

85
00:02:58,116 --> 00:03:00,585
WENT OFF TO JAIL WHEN HILLARY

86
00:03:00,585 --> 00:03:01,119
CLINTON WALKS FREE.

87
00:03:01,119 --> 00:03:03,788
IT SAYS IN THE REPORT SOMEONE

88
00:03:03,788 --> 00:03:05,857
ACCESSED THAT SERVER FROM A

89
00:03:05,857 --> 00:03:06,791
FOREIGN COUNTRY.

90
00:03:06,791 --> 00:03:12,130
WHY IS THAT NOT A CRIMINAL ACT?

91
00:03:12,130 --> 00:03:13,097
>> BECAUSE I DON'T THINK IT

92
00:03:13,097 --> 00:03:14,732
WOULD MAKE A DARN BIT OF

93
00:03:14,732 --> 00:03:15,133
DIFFERENCE.

94
00:03:15,133 --> 00:03:17,235
I WANT TO KNOW WHO WILL

95
00:03:17,235 --> 00:03:18,202
PROSECUTE HER?

96
00:03:18,202 --> 00:03:21,472
LET ME GO NOW TO DAVID.

97
00:03:21,472 --> 00:03:22,740
WE HAVE THE WORLD CUP.

98
00:03:22,740 --> 00:03:27,645
THE PRESIDENT HAD A GREAT WEEK.

99
00:03:27,645 --> 00:03:29,747
KIM JONG-UN AGREED TO

100
00:03:29,747 --> 00:03:30,248
DENUCLEARIZATION.

101
00:03:30,248 --> 00:03:32,016
OBAMA SAID I WILL GET THE WORLD

102
00:03:32,016 --> 00:03:34,318
CUP AND I WILL GET THE OLYMPICS

103
00:03:34,318 --> 00:03:34,719
HERE.

104
00:03:34,719 --> 00:03:36,421
HE COULD NOT DO ANYTHING.

105
00:03:36,421 --> 00:03:38,423
>> LOOK, HE HAD A GREAT WEEK.

106
00:03:38,423 --> 00:03:40,291
THE PRESIDENT IT'S ONE OF THE

107
00:03:40,291 --> 00:03:43,461
GREAT WEEKS OF HIS

108
00:03:43,461 --> 00:03:43,928
ADMINISTRATION.

109
00:03:43,928 --> 00:03:46,931
JOB NUMBERS TODAY UNBELIEVABLE.

110
00:03:46,931 --> 00:03:48,800
LOWEST IN 44 YEARS.

111
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:53,271
OUR ECONOMY IS HUMMY.

112
00:03:53,271 --> 00:03:54,972
-- HUMMING.

113
00:03:54,972 --> 00:03:56,774
THE PRESIDENT GOT ELECTED

114
00:03:56,774 --> 00:04:03,347
BECAUSE HE SAID JOBS, JOBS, JOBS

115
00:04:03,347 --> 00:04:03,815
BECAUSE HE SAID JOBS, JOBS, JO S

116
00:04:03,815 --> 00:04:06,017
JOBS, AND HE MEANT IT.

117
00:04:06,017 --> 00:04:09,754
A GREAT WEEK ON THE ECONOMIC AND

118
00:04:09,754 --> 00:04:13,558
DEALING WITH NORTH KOREA ON

119
00:04:13,558 --> 00:04:14,058
DENUCLEARIZATION.

120
00:04:14,058 --> 00:04:15,259
THE WORLD CUP, THE GUY WHO USED

121
00:04:15,259 --> 00:04:17,595
TO BE THE HEAD OF THE AMERICAN

122
00:04:17,595 --> 00:04:21,966
WORLD CUP SAID OH BOB, OBAMA

123
00:04:21,966 --> 00:04:23,100
WILL GET THIS NOW.

124
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:25,937
IN 2016, OH, WE CAN'T HAVE

125
00:04:25,937 --> 00:04:27,171
DONALD TRUMP.

126
00:04:27,171 --> 00:04:31,108
THE CUP WILL NEVER COME HERE.

127
00:04:31,108 --> 00:04:33,244
HE PROVES EVERYBODY WRONG.

128
00:04:33,244 --> 00:04:37,315
>> SO, CORY, LET'S TALK ABOUT

129
00:04:37,315 --> 00:04:41,052
THOSE PEOPLE WHO PREDICTED

130
00:04:41,052 --> 00:04:44,322
NUCLEAR WAR AND THAT PRESIDENT

131
00:04:44,322 --> 00:04:45,523
TRUMP DOESN'T KNOW WHAT HE IS

132
00:04:45,523 --> 00:04:45,823
DOING.

133
00:04:45,823 --> 00:04:47,091
ASIDE FROM ALL OF THAT, I WANT

134
00:04:47,091 --> 00:04:49,093
TO ASK YOU A QUESTION.

135
00:04:49,093 --> 00:04:51,195
I WILL VEER OFF FOR A SECOND.

136
00:04:51,195 --> 00:04:53,798
HOW DOES THIS GUY FLY BACK AND

137
00:04:53,798 --> 00:04:55,533
FORTH TO SINGAPORE AND DO ALL OF

138
00:04:55,533 --> 00:04:57,034
THE NEGOTIATIONS AND HE IS

139
00:04:57,034 --> 00:04:58,703
WALKING OUTSIDE OF THE WHITE

140
00:04:58,703 --> 00:05:00,104
HOUSE TODAY JUST GREETING A

141
00:05:00,104 --> 00:05:02,740
PUNCH OF PRESS PEOPLE AND

142
00:05:02,740 --> 00:05:03,441
ANSWERING PRESS PEOPLE.

143
00:05:03,441 --> 00:05:05,977
ON TOP OF HIS GAME.

144
00:05:05,977 --> 00:05:06,911
HOW DOES HE DO?

145
00:05:06,911 --> 00:05:07,845
>> DONALD TRUMP IS A MACHINE.

146
00:05:07,845 --> 00:05:09,914
I MEAN THAT.

147
00:05:09,914 --> 00:05:11,449
I SPENT THOUSANDS OF HOURS WITH

148
00:05:11,449 --> 00:05:11,749
HIM.

149
00:05:11,749 --> 00:05:13,251
HE NEVER SLEEPS.

150
00:05:13,251 --> 00:05:15,086
HE CONTINUES TO WORK.

151
00:05:15,086 --> 00:05:16,721
THAT'S WHY THE FIRST 18 MONTHS

152
00:05:16,721 --> 00:05:17,855
OF THIS ADMINISTRATION, HE'S

153
00:05:17,855 --> 00:05:19,023
BEEN SO SUCCESSFUL.

154
00:05:19,023 --> 00:05:21,926
LOOK AT WHAT HE TALKED ABOUT.

155
00:05:21,926 --> 00:05:22,660
4% GROWTH.

156
00:05:22,660 --> 00:05:24,529
THEY SAID YOU WILL NEVER GET

157
00:05:24,529 --> 00:05:24,829
THERE.

158
00:05:24,829 --> 00:05:28,132
NOW THE FED SAYS 4.8%.

159
00:05:28,132 --> 00:05:31,068
HE NEVER GIVES UP.

160
00:05:31,068 --> 00:05:34,038
WE WALKED OUT AND DID THAT PRESS

161
00:05:34,038 --> 00:05:35,006
CONFERENCE WITH FOX.

162
00:05:35,006 --> 00:05:37,174
I AM SURE THE STAFF SAID DON'T

163
00:05:37,174 --> 00:05:37,742
DO THAT.

164
00:05:37,742 --> 00:05:39,010
DONALD TRUMP IS HIS BEST WHEN HE

165
00:05:39,010 --> 00:05:41,379
IS DONALD TRUMP.

166
00:05:41,379 --> 00:05:42,914
THE BOOK THAT DAVE AND I WROTE

167
00:05:42,914 --> 00:05:45,349
IS WHY HE IS SUCCESSFUL.

168
00:05:45,349 --> 00:05:46,517
HE DOES THINGS OUTSIDE OF THE

169
00:05:46,517 --> 00:05:46,918
NORM.

170
00:05:46,918 --> 00:05:48,619
STAYED UP FOR 25 HOURS STRAIGHT

171
00:05:48,619 --> 00:05:49,520
ON THAT AIRPLANE.

172
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:51,656
GOT OFF THE PLANE AND KEPT ON

173
00:05:51,656 --> 00:05:51,989
WORKING.

174
00:05:51,989 --> 00:05:55,860
HE DIDN'T GO TO BED FOR A WEEK

175
00:05:55,860 --> 00:05:57,795
LIKE HILLARY CLINTON DID BEFORE

176
00:05:57,795 --> 00:05:58,462
THE DEBATE.

177
00:05:58,462 --> 00:06:00,197
>> SHE WAS IN BED FOR LONGER

178
00:06:00,197 --> 00:06:01,332
THAN THAT.

179
00:06:01,332 --> 00:06:02,433
HE DOESN'T DRINK COFFEE?

180
00:06:02,433 --> 00:06:04,602
>> NO, YOU KNOW DONALD TRUMP.

181
00:06:04,602 --> 00:06:05,536
NO COFFEE.

182
00:06:05,536 --> 00:06:07,371
>> DIET COKES.

183
00:06:07,371 --> 00:06:13,711
>> IT'S RAW ADRENALINE AND DIET

184
00:06:13,711 --> 00:06:14,679
COAX.

185
00:06:14,679 --> 00:06:15,713
-- COKES.

186
00:06:15,713 --> 00:06:17,214
HE WEARS OUT THE STAFF.

187
00:06:17,214 --> 00:06:19,717
>> HE HAS A DIFFERENT GEAR THAN

188
00:06:19,717 --> 00:06:20,484
EVERYBODY ELSE.

189
00:06:20,484 --> 00:06:22,420
INCLUDING THE STAFF.

190
00:06:22,420 --> 00:06:24,655
THIS GUY WORKS 20 HOURS A DAY, 7

191
00:06:24,655 --> 00:06:26,090
DAYS A WEEK.

192
00:06:26,090 --> 00:06:29,226
THAT'S WHY OUR ECONOMY IS

193
00:06:29,226 --> 00:06:29,560
MOVING.

194
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:32,496
PEOPLE WONDER HOW COULD HE DO SO

195
00:06:32,496 --> 00:06:33,464
MANY DIFFERENT THINGS?

196
00:06:33,464 --> 00:06:35,833
IT'S BECAUSE HE NEVER STOPS.

197
00:06:35,833 --> 00:06:37,435
A SMART AND DILIGENT GUY.

198
00:06:37,435 --> 00:06:40,037
DOING AN INCREDIBLE JOB AS

199
00:06:40,037 --> 00:06:40,404
PRESIDENT.

200
00:06:40,404 --> 00:06:42,173

203
00:06:46,944 --> 00:06:49,747
>> JUDGE, THE PRESS NEVER

204
00:06:49,747 --> 00:06:50,715
COMPLAINS THAT THIS PRESIDENT IS

205
00:06:50,715 --> 00:06:52,149
NOT DOING ENOUGH.

206
00:06:52,149 --> 00:06:53,951
THEY COMPLAIN THEY CAN'T KEEP UP

207
00:06:53,951 --> 00:06:54,652
WITH THEM.

208
00:06:54,652 --> 00:06:57,688
A FAR CRY FROM OBAMA WHO DID

209
00:06:57,688 --> 00:06:58,589
NOTHING FOR 8 YEARS.

210
00:06:58,589 --> 00:00:00,000
