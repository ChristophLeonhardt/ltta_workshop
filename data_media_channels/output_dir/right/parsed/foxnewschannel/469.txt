LIBERALS" WHICH I SHAMELESSLY
TRY TO ADVANCE ON THIS SHOW.
JOINING ME NOW IN A "JUSTICE"
EXPLOSIVE, WE HAVE A LOT TO GET
TO, CALIFORNIA CONGRESSMAN HOUSE
INTEL COMMITTEE CHAIRMAN DEVIN
NUNES.
IT'S A PLEASURE TO HAVE YOU HERE
IN NEW YORK.
I WANT TO GO TO WHAT THE
PRESIDENT WAS SAYING.
HE HAD A LOT TO SAY ABOUT THE
LETTER THAT WAS LEAKED ON
DR. FORD.
ONE FEINSTEIN HAD.
LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT THIS FOR A
SECOND.
PRESIDENT TRUMP: REMEMBER DIANNE
FEINSTEIN.
DID YOU LEAK?
PRESIDENT TRUMP: WEB HER ANSWER?
DID YOU LEAK THE DOCUMENT?
UH, UH, WHAT?
NO, UH, NO, I DIDN'T LEAK --
WELL, WAIT ONE MINUTE.
OH, OH, NO, WE DIDN'T LEAK.
JUDGE JEANINE: YOUR TAKE ON
THAT.
>> WHAT YOU ARE SEEING IS THE
COLLAPSE OF INSTITUTIONS IN THIS
COUNTRY.
IT'S REALLY CONCERNING.
WHEN YOU TAKE A SUPREME COURT
JUSTICE AND YOU HAVE SENATORS
TALKING ABOUT HIGH SCHOOL
YEARBOOKS, YOU ARE WATCHING THE
COLLAPSE OF THE SENATE.
COLLAPSE OF THE REPUBLIC.
IT'S REALLY DANGEROUS.
JUDGE JEANINE: WHAT ABOUT
FEINSTEIN AND HER ROLE.
ALL THIS STUFF IS SUPPOSE TO BE
HANDLED.
SHE QUESTIONED HIM.
THE SENATE HAD THE OPPORTUNITY.
>> SHE HAD A RESPONSIBILITY TO
SHARE THAT WITH REPUBLICANS.
AND SECOND SHE SHOULD HAVE MADE
SURE THAT THE FBI KNEW ABOUT
THAT IF THEY WERE DOING AN
ADDITIONAL BACKGROUND CHECK.
JUDGE JEANINE: IS THERE A
KICKBACK FOR HER, A POLITICAL
KICKBACK BEFORE SHE RELEASES IT
TO CHAIRMAN GRASSLEY, THE SENATE
JUDICIARY, SHE GETS A LAWYER FOR
THE WOMAN.
>> JUDGE KAVANAUGH SAID IT BEST.
HE AMERICAN SHOULD LOOK AT HIS
TESTIMONY.
HIS TESTIMONY WAS AMAZING.
EVERY AMERICAN SHOULD WATCH IT.
HE TALKED ABOUT THE SCHEME THAT
THEY ALL HAD WORKING TOGETHER.
IT WAS CLEAR YOU HAD OUTSIDE
GROUPS FUNDING AN ATTACK ON HIM.
AND THEY KNEW MANY OUTSIDE
GROUPS KNEW THEY WERE GOING TO
DROP THIS BOMB BECAUSE IT WAS
THEIR LAST-SECOND CHANCE TO STOP
KAVANAUGH FROM BECOMING A
SUPREME COURT JUSTICE.
IF THAT HAPPENS AND YOU HAVE GOT
ALL KIND OF ACCUSATIONS AND
GONLD KNOWS WHAT WILL COME OUT
IN THE NEXT WEEK HERE.
JUDGE JEANINE: THE INSISTENCE
THAT THE FBI INVESTIGATE.
IF THE FIRST SIX FBI
INVESTIGATIONS DIDN'T INDICATE
ANYTHING, HOW IS THIS ONE GOING
TO BE A BETTER ONE?
>> I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHERE THE
FBI WOULD START.
SHE GAVE HER TESTIMONY, SO I
DOUBT THERE IS ANY MORE THAN
THAT.
ALL THE PEOPLE HAVE SWORN WHICH
WOULD BE A CRIME.
SO YOU HAVE NO WITNESSES, YOU
DON'T KNOW THE LOCATION.
HOW DO YOU EVEN START TO
INVESTIGATE THIS.
JUDGE JEANINE: SHE HASN'T ASKED
THE MARYLAND POLICE FOR WHICH
THERE IS NO A CUTE OF
LIMITATIONS, TO INVESTIGATE IT.
WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THAT?
>> HOW WILL THE POLICE
INVESTIGATE IT?
NO ONE CAN INVESTIGATE THIS.
JUDGE JEANINE: SHE DOESN'T WANT
IT VERSUS QUITED.
>> SUPPOSEDLY SHE DIDN'T WANT
HER NAME OUT IN THE PUBLIC.
THERE IS A WHOLE GROUP OF PEOPLE
COORDINATING THIS EFFORT INSIDE
THE SENATE WITH THE DEMOCRATS
AND ON THE OUTSIDE WITH THE LEFT
WING GROUPS WITH THE MEDIA
TRAILING BEHIND.
JUDGE JEANINE: WHAT'S GOING TO
HAPPEN WITH HEIDI HEIGHT CAM AND
MURKOWSKI AND COLLINS?
>> I BELIEVE THE SENATORS IN
THE RED STATES, IF THEY DON'T
VOTE TO CONFIRM KAVANAUGH, I
THINK THEY WILL BE IN TROUBLE
FROM THIS ELECTION.
REPUBLICANS ARE HAPPY WITH THE
ECONOMY.
EVERY AMERICAN SHOULD BE HAPPY
WITH THE ECONOMY.
BUT WHAT YOU ARE SEEING IS
FINALLY REPUBLICANS ARE WAKING
UP -- EVERYBODY THOUGHT THIS WAS
A JOKE.
BUT THEY ARE STARTING TO SEE NOW
BECAUSE OF THE SITUATION JUDGE
