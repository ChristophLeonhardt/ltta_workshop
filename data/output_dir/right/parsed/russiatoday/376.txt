so is the very structure of our society
in the council's of government we must
guard against the acquisition of
unwarranted influence whether sought or
unsought by the military-industrial
complex the potential for the disastrous
rise of misplaced power exists and will
persist we must never let the weight of
this combination endanger our liberties
or democratic processes we should take
nothing for granted
only an alert and knowledgeable
citizenry can compel the proper meshing
of the huge industrial and military
machinery of Defense with our peaceful
methods and goals so that security and
Liberty may prosper together
