how do you think the sports media pull out of this or do they pull out of this because right now everybody's cutting the cord on ESPN ESPN is just nose-diving I mean they've had a serious problem with people not watching their stuff anymore and it seems like they're doubling down on the worst strategy humanly possible which is to add just more extraordinarily polarizing content with nobody to even counter the other side Mike did cut losses his job over there because Mike Ditka happens to be slightly right of center but you've got everybody over there who's wildly to the left yeah well they just rehired Keith or exact exact so it I think the market is starting to speak and I think that their brand has been damaged because if you understand who sports fans are they tend to lean a bit more conservative and so they've irritated the largest segment of the and so let's say you're a sports fan but you're not really political but if you understand the values taught in sports they're not political but they are conservative the values taught in sports again I go back to what I said earlier we fix the problems from inside this locker room we don't blame Outsiders you know it's a pull yourself up by the bootstraps it's American it's awesome their towers yeah you're not getting on the field two-hand play yes and so I think even if you're not polluting you're kind of like where's all this victimhood coming from LeBron James is now on TV and at press conferences say oh my god and I don't want to I do want to mock it because it was silly LeBron James on TV he compared someone allegedly riding on a gate of his 20 million dollar mansion in Brentwood someone allegedly wrote on his garage gate the n-word and he analogized that to Emmett Till and Emmett Till's mother sharing the pain of Emmett Till being lynched and assassinated he analogized that to him having the n-word written on his 20 million dollar mansion out here in Britt wood when he's lived at the time in Akron so a home that he's not in allegedly has the n-word written on it we never see a picture of it it's it's he says it was cleaned it was on there in the morning then his staff cleaned it up he never saw it his kids weren't there there was no danger he analogize it to Emmett Till and and so I'm just sports fans people with common sense alike how you're living one of the greatest wealthiest privilege lives in the history of America you gotta put him in the top 1,000 I think I mean worth about a half billion he celebrated all over the planet anywhere he goes they rush him in to get seated and gets preferential treatment and he's on TV yeah I can have if it can happen to me if someone could write the n-word I mean it could happen it it just doesn't ring true and I think most sports fans are like this is back now LeBron James is a victim
