ROB: OKAY, WELCOME BACK,
NEWLY-MINTED MIKE POMPEO NORTH
KOREA WITH PEACE AND PROSPERITY
IF THE COUNTRY QUICKLY GIVES UP
NUCLEAR WEAPONS.
>> IF WE ARE GOING TO GET TO
THIS HISTORIC OUTCOME BOTH SIDES
HAVE TO BE PREPARED TO TAKE
MEASURES TO ACHIEVE IT.
IT IS OUR HOPE THAT KIM WANTS TO
MAKE STRATEGIC CHANGE IN
DIRECTION OF HIS COUNTRY AND HIS
PEOPLE AND IF HE'S PREPARED TO
DO THAT, PRESIDENT TRUMP IS
PREPARED TO ASSURE THAT THIS
COULD BE A SUCCESSFUL
TRANSITION.
CARLEY: WITH LESS THAN A MONTH
UNTIL HISTORIC SUMMIT BETWEEN
TWO LEADERS, WHAT TYPES OF
NEGOTIATIONS CAN WE EXPECT TO
SEE?
JOINING US NOW IS NATIONAL
SECURITY ANALYST REBECCA,
REBECCA, THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR
BEING WITH US THIS MORNING.
NOW, KIM JONG UN IS SOMEBODY WHO
HAS ESSENTIALLY BENEFITED FROM
THE FACT THAT HIS COUNTRY POOR
BECAUSE WHEN YOU ARE POOR YOU
CAN'T RISE AND OVERTHROW BRUTAL
DICTATOR, DOES HE HAVE SOME SORT
OF ULTERIOR MOTIVE THAT WE MIGHT
KNOW KNOW ABOUT?
>> HE WANTS TO BE TREATED AS THE
DELEGATE MATE POWER, HE WANTS TO
RESPECT FROM WORLD LEADERS, HE
WANTS THE RESPECT FROM THE
UNITED STATES, HE WANTS PROMISES
OF ASSURANCES THAT THE UNITED
STATES ISN'T GOING TO THREATEN
FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT NORTH
CAROLINA.
HE DOES WANT ECONOMIC GAINS
THERE BUT THIS IS NOT A GUY WHO
CARES ABOUT THE WELL-BEING OF
HIS CITIZENRY, IF HE DOES CARE
NOW THIS WILL BE A CHANGE IN HIS
MIND.
I THINK IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT
THAT THE POINT THAT SECRETARY OF
STATE POMPEO MADE THAT THEY WANT
TO SEE AN ACTUAL STRATEGIC
CHANGE ON THE PART OF KIM JONG
UN, THAT IS EXACTLY RIGHT,
THAT'S WHAT'S NECESSARY AND WHAT
POMPEO HAS LAYED OUT AS
NECESSARY CONDITIONS FOR THE
UNITED STATES TO GIVE THEM
ECONOMIC GAINS AND ECONOMIC
PROSPERITY AND GET THEM BACK ON
ECONOMIC FOOTING IS EXACTLY
RIGHT.
THAT'S THE COMPLETE VERIFIABLE
DENUCLEARIZATION OF NORTH KOREA,
IT'S GOING TO BE HARD TO PULL
OFF.
ROB: THIS IS COMING UP ON
JUNE 12TH, AT THIS POINT A LOT
OF SPACE BETWEEN THE TWO ON
EXACTLY WHAT THEY ARE WILLING TO
GIVE AND, I THINK, WHAT THEY
WANT AND SHE MAKES A GREAT POINT
ABOUT WHY WHY WOULD YOU WANT TO
COMP AN ECONOMY.
EVERYBODY IS SKEPTICAL OF THIS,
IT SEEMS HARD TO THINK THAT
IT'LL WORK OUT.
>> YOU KNOW, PRESIDENT TRUMP IS
GOING TO TRY TO DETERMINE IF KIM
JONG UN IS BEING SINCERE AND
THEY ARE GOING TO BE SEVERAL
THINGS TO TELL IF HE IS OR NOT.
ONE IF HE DOESN'T AGREE TO FULL
DENUCLEARIZATION, I MEAN, IT'S
REALLY IMPORTANT THAT THIS IS
COMING ON THE HEELS OF PRESIDENT
TRUMP GETTING OUT OF THE IRAN
DEAL.
SO HE'S DETERMINED NOT TO MAKE
THE MISTAKES TO HAVE IRAN DEAL
WHICH MEANS THE BAR IS HIGH.
IT MEANS TOTALLY DISMANTLING THE
NORTH KOREAN PROGRAM.
I MEAN, IN THE IRANIAN THEY WERE
ALLOW TODAY KEEP LOW ENRICHMENT
LEVELS THAT.
WILL NOT HAPPEN WITH NORTH
KOREA.
PRESIDENT TRUMP AND HIS TEAM
WANT TO MAKE SURE MISSILES ARE
REMOVED.
THAT'S SOMETHING THAT THE OBAMA
ADMINISTRATION KEPT WITH IRAN
AND REMEMBER MISSILES GO HAND IN
GLOVE WITH THE NUCLEAR PROGRAM
BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT'S NECESSARY
TO DELIVER THE NUCLEAR WAR HEADS
AND SO THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION
IS EXACTLY RIGHT THAT THAT IS
PART OF THE PROGRAM AND WE ARE
NOT GOING TO LEAVE THEM AND GIVE
THEM ECONOMIC BENEFIT UNTIL THE
WHOLE THING IS DISMANTLED IN
LEAVING THE COUNTRY.
CARLEY: CERTAINLY A TRICKY
SITUATION TO NAVIGATE.
THE U.S. MOVING EMBASSY, HOW
SIGNIFICANT IS THAT TO THE
PEOPLE OF ISRAEL?
>> IT'S INCREDIBLY SIGNIFICANT.
JERUSALEM HAS BEEN THE CAPITAL
OF THE JEWISH PEOPLE FOR 3,000
YEARS, IT'S BEEN THE CAPITAL OF
THE STATE OF ISRAEL SINCE IT'S
INCEPTION 70 YEARS AGO, IT IS A
HISTORICAL FACT AND THE FACT
THAT PRESIDENT TRUMP IS
RECOGNIZING THIS FACT MEANS THE
WORLD TO OUR ALLIES, THE
ISRAELIS AND PALESTINIANS OF THE
NOTION THAT ANYTHING OTHER THAN
THE CAPITAL OF ISRAEL.
IT'S ALSO INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT
TO PRESIDENT TRUMP'S BASE
BECAUSE THIS IS SOMETHING THAT
HE PROMISED HE WOULD DO AS HAND
DATE AND ONCE AGAIN DELIVERING
ON IT.
IT'S BEEN AN AMERICAN LAW SINCE
1995 TO MOVE EMBASSY TO
JERUSALEM AND EVERY PRESIDENT
SINCE 1995 HAS USED WAIVER
AUTHORITY NOT TO DO IT.
PRESIDENT TRUMP, HE'S LISTENING
TO THE WILL OF THE PEOPLE AND
NOT DIFFERING TO THE UN ON IT.
ROB: THEY AVOID IT BECAUSE IT
COULD BE MESSY, ALSO END OF
TWO-STATE SOLUTION, A LOT OF
