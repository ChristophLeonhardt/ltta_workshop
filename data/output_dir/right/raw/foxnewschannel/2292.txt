1
00:00:13,321 --> 00:00:18,326
HOWIE: BILL COSBY'S RETRIAL WAS

2
00:00:18,326 --> 00:00:20,061
GETTING LITTLE ATTENTION UNTIL A

3
00:00:20,061 --> 00:00:21,762
VERDICT WAS ANNOUNCED.

4
00:00:21,762 --> 00:00:25,166
>> BILL COSBY HAS BEEN FOUND

5
00:00:25,166 --> 00:00:26,500
GUILTY ON ALL CHARGES AGAINST

6
00:00:26,500 --> 00:00:26,767
HIM.

7
00:00:26,767 --> 00:00:29,570
>> WE ARE UNDER KAITD,

8
00:00:29,570 --> 00:00:31,939
VALIDATED, AND WE ARE NOW PART

9
00:00:31,939 --> 00:00:35,243
OF THE TSUNAMI OF WOMEN, POWER

10
00:00:35,243 --> 00:00:35,743
AND JUSTICE.

11
00:00:35,743 --> 00:00:37,912
WE ARE NOT SHUTTING UP, AND WE

12
00:00:37,912 --> 00:00:39,513
ARE NOT GOING AWAY.

13
00:00:39,513 --> 00:00:40,381
GET OVER IT.

14
00:00:40,381 --> 00:00:42,950
>> I THANK YOU ALL IN THE MEDIA.

15
00:00:42,950 --> 00:00:45,419
YOU ARE THE PILLARS OF

16
00:00:45,419 --> 00:00:45,820
DEMOCRACY.

17
00:00:45,820 --> 00:00:47,688
WITHOUT YOU NONE OF THIS WOULD

18
00:00:47,688 --> 00:00:50,858
HAVE HAPPENED.

19
00:00:50,858 --> 00:00:55,029
HOWIE: JOINING US IS CARLEY

20
00:00:55,029 --> 00:00:55,763
SHIMKUS.

21
00:00:55,763 --> 00:01:00,401
THERE HAS BEEN ALMOST A

22
00:01:00,401 --> 00:01:02,336
UNIVERSAL MEDIA COVERAGE OF

23
00:01:02,336 --> 00:01:02,937
THIS.

24
00:01:02,937 --> 00:01:06,307
WHAT MAKES THIS SUCH A CULTURAL

25
00:01:06,307 --> 00:01:06,641
MOMENT?

26
00:01:06,641 --> 00:01:09,277
CARLEY: SYMBOLICALLY THIS TRIAL

27
00:01:09,277 --> 00:01:11,445
IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE BILL COSBY

28
00:01:11,445 --> 00:01:14,348
IS THE FIRST FAMOUS MAN TO BE

29
00:01:14,348 --> 00:01:17,485
FOUND GUILTY OF SEXUAL

30
00:01:17,485 --> 00:01:19,553
MISCONDUCT FOLLOWING THE

31
00:01:19,553 --> 00:01:20,755
#metoo MOVEMENT.

32
00:01:20,755 --> 00:01:22,590
I WOULD LIKE TO THINK HE WOULD

33
00:01:22,590 --> 00:01:24,525
HAVE BEEN FOUND GUILTY

34
00:01:24,525 --> 00:01:25,059
REGARDLESS.

35
00:01:25,059 --> 00:01:28,262
BUT EVERYTHING THAT HAPPENED

36
00:01:28,262 --> 00:01:31,265
WITH HARVEY WEINSTEIN AND KEVIN

37
00:01:31,265 --> 00:01:34,602
SPACEY WAS IN THE BACK OF THEIR

38
00:01:34,602 --> 00:01:34,902
MINDS.

39
00:01:34,902 --> 00:01:37,605
HOWIE: HE WASN'T FOUND GUILTY

40
00:01:37,605 --> 00:01:40,608
THE LAST TIME.

41
00:01:40,608 --> 00:01:42,343
THERE WAS A DIFFERENT THIS TIME.

42
00:01:42,343 --> 00:01:44,445
IT'S A DIFFERENT CLIMATE.

43
00:01:44,445 --> 00:01:47,448
BUT ALSO THERE WAS SEVERAL OTHER

44
00:01:47,448 --> 00:01:50,151
COSBY ACCUSERS WHO WERE ALLOWED

45
00:01:50,151 --> 00:01:55,056
TO TESTIFY AS OPPOSED TO JUST

46
00:01:55,056 --> 00:01:57,725
ANDREA CONSTAND WHO WAS THE

47
00:01:57,725 --> 00:02:00,127
FOCUS OF THE PROSECUTION.

48
00:02:00,127 --> 00:02:02,863
CARLEY: THE D.A. CALLED THOSE

49
00:02:02,863 --> 00:02:05,599
WOMEN THE DIFFERENCE MAKERS.

50
00:02:05,599 --> 00:02:08,102
PROSECUTORS COULD CREATE THE

51
00:02:08,102 --> 00:02:11,572
NARRATIVE THAT ANDREA CONSTAND

52
00:02:11,572 --> 00:02:15,242
WAS PART OF A BEHAVIOR COSBY

53
00:02:15,242 --> 00:02:16,978
USED.

54
00:02:16,978 --> 00:02:21,415
COSBY USED A DIFFERENT LEGAL

55
00:02:21,415 --> 00:02:23,451
TEAM WHERE THEY ATTACKED THE

56
00:02:23,451 --> 00:02:26,454
WITNESSES.

57
00:02:26,454 --> 00:02:27,121
SUGGESTING ANDREA CONSTAND

58
00:02:27,121 --> 00:02:29,590
WASSED A GOLD DURING AND CALLING

59
00:02:29,590 --> 00:02:32,393
ANOTHER WITNESS AS A WOMAN WHO

60
00:02:32,393 --> 00:02:34,495
SLEPT AROUND.

61
00:02:34,495 --> 00:02:40,968
HOWIE: AN HAD MADE A SETTLEMENT

62
00:02:40,968 --> 00:02:42,169
WITH ANDREA CONSTAND.

63
00:02:42,169 --> 00:02:44,505
THERE WAS LITTLE ATTENTION, WAS

64
00:02:44,505 --> 00:02:46,574
THAT BECAUSE IT WAS SEEN AS OLD

65
00:02:46,574 --> 00:02:49,276
NEWS OR WAS IT A MISJUDGMENT BY

66
00:02:49,276 --> 00:02:50,711
THE PRESS.

67
00:02:50,711 --> 00:02:52,847
CARLEY: THERE IS SO MUCH NEWS

68
00:02:52,847 --> 00:02:54,515
COMING OUT OF WASHINGTON.

69
00:02:54,515 --> 00:02:57,585
THIS IS A RETRIAL.

70
00:02:57,585 --> 00:03:01,255
ALSO BILL COSBY IS 80 YEARS OLD,

71
00:03:01,255 --> 00:03:02,623
HE'S IN POOR HEALTH.

72
00:03:02,623 --> 00:03:04,925
HIS LEGACY HAS ALREADY BEEN

73
00:03:04,925 --> 00:03:05,893
DESTROYED.

74
00:03:05,893 --> 00:03:08,896
THE IMPACT OF A GUILTY VERDICT

75
00:03:08,896 --> 00:03:12,433
IS MUCH LESS THAN AT THE PEAK OF

76
00:03:12,433 --> 00:03:13,034
HIS CAREER.

77
00:03:13,034 --> 00:03:15,503
HOWIE: LOOKING AT THIS, I THINK

78
00:03:15,503 --> 00:03:19,673
THERE HAS BEEN A TENDENCY TO

79
00:03:19,673 --> 00:03:20,975
THINK THAT THIS IS NOW THE

80
00:03:20,975 --> 00:03:23,177
PRECEDENT FOR OTHER KINDS OF

81
00:03:23,177 --> 00:03:25,746
CASES WHEN IT MAY BE RATHER

82
00:03:25,746 --> 00:03:29,350
UNIQUE TO COSBY AS OPPOSED TO

83
00:03:29,350 --> 00:03:31,919
WHEN YOU HAVE A DEFENDANT WHO IS

84
00:03:31,919 --> 00:03:34,188
NOT PARTICULARLY FAMOUS.

85
00:03:34,188 --> 00:03:38,025
CARLEY: I DO THINK EVERY TRIAL

86
00:03:38,025 --> 00:03:40,494
WILL BE JUDGED FAIRLY AND

87
00:03:40,494 --> 00:03:41,062
EQUALLY.

88
00:03:41,062 --> 00:03:43,030
PEOPLE CALL THIS A PRECEDENT.

89
00:03:43,030 --> 00:03:44,632
I DON'T THINK YOU CAN MAKE THAT

90
00:03:44,632 --> 00:03:45,499
CASE.

91
00:03:45,499 --> 00:03:48,269
BUT I'M SURE HARVEY WEINSTEIN

92
00:03:48,269 --> 00:03:50,905
DID LOOK AT THIS VERDICT.

93
00:03:50,905 --> 00:03:52,940
THERE ARE SO MANY SIMILARITIES

94
00:03:52,940 --> 00:03:55,976
BETWEEN THESE TWO MEN IN HOW

95
00:03:55,976 --> 00:03:58,412
OFTEN THEY USED THEIR POWER TO

96
00:03:58,412 --> 00:00:00,000
ASSAULT WOMEN.
