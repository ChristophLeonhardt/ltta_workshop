THIS IS "THE FIVE." Jesse: PRESIDENT TRUMP HAMMERING DEMOCRATS WITH A STERN MID-TERM MESSAGE. President Trump: COME ELECTION DAY, AMERICANS WILL REMEMBER KAVANAUGH AND THEY WILL REMEMBER ALL SORTS OF OTHER THINGS, BECAUSE THAT WAS A SHAMEFUL ACT. THIS WILL BE AN ELECTION OF KAVANAUGH, THE CARAVAN, LAW AND ORDER, AND COMMON SENSE. BUT THE CHOICE COULD NOT BE MORE CLEAR, DEMOCRATS PRODUCE MOBS. REPUBLICANS PRODUCE JOBS. Jesse: DEMOCRATS DON'T SEEM TO BE ABLE TO GET ON THE SAME PAGE. FOR EXAMPLE, TEXAS SENATE HOPEFUL BETO O'ROARKE IS DOUBLING DOWN ON IMPEACHING TRUMP. I WOULD LIKEN IMPEACHMENT TO AN INDICTMENT. THERE IS ENOUGH THERE TO PROCEED WITH A TRIAL FOR A FULL VETTING OF THE FACTS, AND MAKES THE BEST INFORMED DECISION IN THE INTERESTS OF THIS COUNTRY. AND OUR FUTURE. Jesse: SENATOR SPARTACUS, COREY BOOKER, MAKING THIS BIZARRE CLAIM, CANADA IS MORE AMERICAN THAN AMERICA. EVERY COUNTRY WE ARE COMPETING WITH, IS DRIVING DOWN THE COST OF COLLEGE. GERMANY COST IS 0 AND 4% MEDIAN INCOME GOING TO COLLEGE. CANADA, I CAN'T STAND HOW AMERICAN CANADA IS, TRUDEAU, HE'S GREAT. COST ABOUT 6% OR 7% OF MEDIAN INCOME FOR COLLEGE. IN AMERICA 5, 2% MEDIAN INCOME. WHY ARE OTHER NATION MORE AMERICAN? Jesse: AND NANCY PELOSI, EXPLAINING WHY SHE DOESN'T REALLY CARE ABOUT SOCIALIST POLICIES HURT AMERICANS. I THINK THAT WE OWE THE AMERICAN PEOPLE TO BE THERE FOR THEM, FOR THEIR FINANCIAL SECURITY, RESPECTING THE DIGNITY AND WORK OF EVERY PERSON IN THAT COUNTRY. AND IF THERE'S SOME COLLATERAL DAMAGE, FOR OTHERS WHO DO NOT SHARE OUR VIEW, SO BE IT. BUT IT SHOULDN'T BE OUR ORIGINAL PURPOSE. Jesse: ALL RIGHT, DANA, SMORGAS BORG OF DEMOCRATIC DEMOCRATS TRYING TO GRASP AT ANYTHING TO GET THE MESSAGE BEFORE THE ELECTION. Dana: TWO OF THOSE, COREY BOOKER AND BETO O'ROARKE ARE RUNNING FOR 2020. NANCY PELOSI PROBABLY THE MOST MESSAGE DISCIPLINED, REMEMBER SHE'S THE ONE SAYING WE'RE NOT GOING TO DO IMPEACHMENT, EVERYBODY STOP THAT, BETO O'ROARKE IS ACTUALLY, SAYING THAT AN INDICTMENT AND IMPEACHMENT ARE THE SAME THING. WHICH IS JUST LEGALLY NOT TRUE. AND HE SHOULD KNOW THAT IF HE'S RUNNING FOR SENATE. I THINK IF HE ENDS UP LOSING IN TEXAS, YOU WILL SEE HIM ON ALL OF THE SHOWS FOR THE NEXT WEEK, WHERE THE HOST WILL BEG HIM TO RUN IN 2020. PRESIDENT TRUMP SHOULD WANT THAT TO HAPPEN. THAT IS NOT A STRONG MESSAGE. COREY BOOKER, WHERE IS HE GIVING IN A SPEECH? IN SOUTH CAROLINA. IS HE IN SOUTH CAROLINA? HE'S HELPING CONGRESSIONAL DEMOCRATS WHO ARE WANTING TO CHALLENGERS TO REPUBLICANS, THEY WANT TO WIN. THAT'S NOT HAPPENING IN SOUTH CAROLINA. UNLIKE LINDSAY GRAY MAM, FOR EXAMPLE, GOING OUT ON A 12-STATE TOUR AFTER KAVANAUGH SO HE CAN DO ALL THOSE THINGS. PRESIDENT TRUMP SAID HIS CLOSING ARGUMENT IS GOING TO BE KAVANAUGH, THE CARAVAN, LAW AND ORDER AND COMMON SENSE. 2 1/2 WEEKS UNTIL THE ELECTION IN THIS NEWS CYCLE IS RISKY, BY SATURDAY WE COULD HAVE A NEW CLOSING ARGUMENT, IF YOU THINK ABOUT IT, KAVANAUGH WAS JUST TWO WEEKS AGO. BUT THE DEMOCRATS ARE BAILING OUT OF THREE IMPORTANT RACES TODAY. DOWN IN TEXAS 23rd, WILL HERD, THAT WAS A DISTRICT THAT HILLARY CLINTON WON BUT HE'S PULLING AHEAD, DEMOCRATS ARE GOING TO TAKE MONEY OUT OF THAT, PUT SCHMIDT WHERE ELSE. ALSO IN NEBRASKA 2 AND MINNESOTA 8. PLACES WHERE THE DEMOCRATS THINK THEY HAVE PICKUPS, THOSE ARE OUT OF REACH FOR THEM. POSSIBLY, OF COURSE IT DEPENDS ON TURNOUT. IF THEY AREN'T GOING TO PUT MONEY IN IT SHOWS SOMETHING. THE DEMOCRATS' CLOSING MESSAGE, HEALTHCARE, SPECIFICALLY PRE-EXISTING CONDITIONS, WHICH WE CAN TALK ABOUT MORE IF YOU WANTED. IF YOU SEE THEIR ADS, THEY'RE STARTING TO SAY, CHECK ON PRESIDENT TRUMP. VOTE FOR A CHECK ON PRESIDENT TRUMP. IF YOU ARE A CHALLENGER TO A REPUBLICAN IN CONGRESS, THE AD WOULD SAY, JESSE WATTERS VOTES WITH PRESIDENT TRUMP 98% OF THE TIME. YOU DON'T WANT THAT, DO YOU? THAT'S HOW THEY'RE TRYING TO MOTIVATE THE BASE. REPUBLICANS Jesse: JUST 98%? Dana: WELL THE IF YOU HEDGE A LITTLE, ON A COUPLE OF THINGS. REPUBLICANS, YOU SEE THEIR ADS, IT'S IMMIGRATION, AND SUPPORT FOR PRESIDENT TRUMP. THIS IDEA THAT THIS IS NOT ABOUT PRESIDENT TRUMP, IT REALLY IS. HE SHOULD EMBRACE IT, BASICALLY, OUT ON THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL ALL WEEKEND. AND I THINK THAT THE REPUBLICANS, IF THEY CAN KEEP FOCUS, A 4R0689 RACES THAT DEMOCRATS A LOT OF THE RACES DEMOCRATS THOUGHT THEY COULD WIN WILL BE OUT OF THEIR REACH. Jesse: WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT THE MID TERMS, GREG? Greg: I TRY NOT TO THINK ABOUT IT THAT MUCH. Jesse: IT'S YOUR JOB. Greg: WEEKEND COMING UP, HAVING FUN. WHEN YOU WATCH THE RALLY, YOU KNOW WHAT TRUMP'S MESSAGE IS. IT'S REALLY SIMPLE, YOU KNOW, IT'S NATIONAL SECURITY, CRIME, BORDERS. IT'S LAW AND ORDER. IT'S REALLY HARD TO FIND OUT WHAT THE DEMOCRATS ARE FOR. YOU ONLY KNOW WHAT THEY'RE AGAINST. HIM, AND THEY'RE ALSO AGAINST BEING OUT OF POWER. THAT LEADS YOU INTO THE ARENA OF WHAT NANCY PELOSI SAID, PARTICULARLY LOATHSOME, THAT COLLATERAL DAMAGE IS ACCEPTABLE. WE KNOW THIS, WE KNOW THAT THE END JUSTIFIES THE MEANS BY ANY MEANS POSSIBLE, THEY NEED THEIR POWER. YOU SAW WITH KAVANAUGH, HIS FAMILY, COLLATERAL DAMAGE. IF YOU LOOK AT WHAT'S HAPPENING NOW WITH THE CARAVAN, THE COLLATERAL DAMAGE ARE THOSE PEOPLE WHO MAY SUFFER GRAVE INJURY TRYING TO CROSS A RIVER OR BEING SEXUALLY ABUSED. THEY WANT THAT SPECTACLE, THEY WANT THAT. THAT'S COLLATERAL DAMAGE. THEY WANT TO RAISE TAXES, INCREASE REGULATION THAT, HURTS BUSINESSES, COLLATERAL DAMAGE. YOU GO BACK TO OBAMACARE, COLLATERAL DAMAGE, YOU LOST YOUR DOCTOR, YOUR RATES WENT UP. THAT WAS COLLATERAL DAMAGE. BECAUSE THE IDEA OF GOVERNMENT RUNNING HEALTHCARE, SUCH A BIG IDEA, DIDN'T MATTER IF YOU LOST YOUR DOCTOR. THEIR MESSAGE, IT'S NOT ABOUT IDEAS, NOT ABOUT PROGRESS, IT'S ABOUT POWER BY ANY MEANS NECESSARY. WHEN YOU HAVE THAT IDEOLOGY, THAT MEANS COLLATERAL DAMAGE IS NOT JUST ACCEPTABLE, IT'S PRACTICALLY THE ONLY THING YOU HAVE, THEY'RE NOT DEMOCRATS, THEY'RE DAMAGE-CATS. Jesse: OH, JUAN. YOU RESPOND TOO THAT. Juan: THE SHOCKING POINT IS THAT REPUBLICANS DON'T HAVE A MESSAGE RIGHT NOW. THE PRESIDENT COMES OUT AND SAYS THE MESSAGE IS KAVANAUGH AND CARAVAN. HE COULD HAVE THROWN IN THERE KAEPERNICK AND KANYE, JUST GO FULL RAPPER. Jesse: 3Ks, 4Ks. Juan: HE'S STRUGGLING WITH THE ABSENCE OF A MESSAGE. LOOK AT THE ADVERTISING PUT ON THE AIR, EVERYBODY THOUGHT IT WAS GOING TO BE ALL ABOUT TAX CUTS FOR THE REPUBLICANS, WE DELIVERED ON THE TAX CUT TO THE FORGOTTEN MAN. WHAT YOU SEE IS REPUBLICANS ARE NOT RUNNING COMMERCIALS ABOUT TAX CUTS BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT HAVING ANY TRACTION WITH THE VOTERS. SO THAT MEANS YOU GO BACK TO RED MEAT, YOU GO BACK TO THE MOST KIND OF CULTURAL WAR ISSUES YOU CAN FIND. FOR TRUMP, YOU KNOW, HIS NUMBER ONE HIT ON THE ROAD IS ALWAYS IMMIGRATION, BUILD THE WALL, GO AFTER 'EM. AND THAT'S WHAT HE'S TRYING TO DO. TRYING TO GET HIS BASE REVVED UP FOR THE MID TERMS, WITH THESE RED MEAT ISSUES. IT'S SO FAR THAT THE BIG ABSENCE IS THAT REPUBLICANS DON'T HAVE A STRONG MESSAGE. WHEN THEY THOUGHT THEY WERE GOING TO HAVE A MESSAGE. I TELL YOU Jesse: THE ECONOMY. Juan: EVEN ON THE IMMIGRATION ISSUE, AT THE WHITE HOUSE THEY'RE HAVING BIG FIGHTS BETWEEN JOHN BOLTEN AND JOHN KELLER, CHIEF KELLY, WITH THE RHETORIC, A SPIKE, MEAN MANY COMING AND CROSSING. THEY CAN'T FIGURE OUT WHAT THE RIGHT POLICY WOULD BE AT THE KWHOUS. BUT THEY WANT TO SAY AT THE WHITE HOUSE. THEY WANT TO SAY IT'S THE DEMOCRATS. TRUMP SAYS IT'S THE DEMOCRATS WHO ARE PAYING TO HAVE THE CARAVAN COME, JESSE. THIS IS RIDICULOUS, ABSURD, BUT I GUESS SOME PEOPLE MIGHT BE SUCKERS OUT THERE AND BUY THAT FOOLISHNESS. Jesse: PEOPLE ARE GOING DOWN THERE FROM AMERICA TO HELP THE CARAVAN COME NORTH. Juan: OH, COME ON. Jesse: THAT'S IN AN ARTICLE, I'LL SHOW YOU. BEFORE WE GET TO KENNEDY, I WANT TO ADDRESS THE TAX CUTS. YOU DON'T HAVE TO SAY TAX CUTS. WHEN HE SAYS JOBS, WHEN HE SAYS THE ECONOMY, WHEN HE SAYS GDP, THAT'S UNDER THE UMBRELLA OF EVERYTHING HE'S DONE ECONOMICALLY. THAT'S INCLUDING GETTING ACROSS. Juan: DOES THAT INCLUDE DRIVE UP THE DEFICIT 17% IN ONE YEAR? Dana: THAT IS LAUGHABLE, A DEMOCRAT TALKING ABOUT THE DEFICIT. Juan: REPUBLICANS SAYING DEFICITS DON'T WATER BECAUSE DEMOCRATS AREN'T IN THE WHITE HOUSE. Jesse: THE U.S. IS COMING FROM THE LEFT. AS OON INDEPENDENT VOTER AND WOMAN WHO DOESN'T FIT NEATLY INTO ANY CATEGORY OR BOX I LOOK AT FREEDOM-KILLING DEFICIT SPENDING AND IT IS ATROCIOUS. FROM BOTH PARTIES. THEY'RE SO SIMILAR IN THAT REGARD, IT REALLY IS, THIS IS A THING THAT IS GOING TO HAMSTRING GENERATIONS AND CURTAIL ECONOMIC MOBILITY, WHICH IS CRITICAL FOR THINGS LIKE HIRING NEW EMPLOYEES AND GOING OUT AND SPENDING MONEY. WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT CONSUMER OPTIMISM, ONE OF THE BIG DRIVERS FOR THE ECONOMY, AND FOR THE STOCK MARKET, THAT IS COMPLETELY STIFLED WHEN WE FINALLY GET THE BILL FOR THIS OUTRAGEOUS MONEY THAT WE'RE SPENDING ON EVERYTHING. AND NO ONE, PAUL RYAN CAME INTO POWER AS THIS WONKY SPENDING, YOU KNOW, HE WAS A PERSON OF NEUTRALIZED SPENDING AND TALKED ABOUT CUTTING COSTS. AND THE DEBT IS NOW $21 TRILLION. WHEN NANCY PELOSI GOES OUT, AND WHEN SHE IS THE MOUTHPIECE FOR THIS PARTY, WHEN SHE TALKS ABOUT THE HOUSE IS GOING TO ONCE AGAIN REST IN DEMOCRAT HANDS, THAT RILES UP REPUBLICANS MORE THAN ANYTHING, AND INDEPENDENTS, BECAUSE SHE'S NOT A LIKABLE PERSON. SHE'S NOT ONLY UNLIKABLE, SHE'S A PERSON WHO DOESN'T HAVE A MESSAGE. YOU CAN JOKE THAT REPUBLICANS DON'T HAVE A MESSAGE, AND YOU MAY NOT AGREE WITH IT, BUT SOMETHING IS SIMPLE, AS JOBS NOT MOBS THAT, RESONATES. PEOPLE WOULD MUCH RATHER HAVE JOBS AND MONEY FOR THEIR KIDS THAN RUN UP AGAINST A WALL OF PROTESTERS WHO ARE GOING TO CALL THEM NAMES AND SPIT ON THEM AND STOP THEIR CAR AND VANDALIZE NICE CITIES. Greg: COREY BOOKER, WE SKIPPED OVER IT, HE SAID CANADA IS MORE AMERICAN. IS HE AWARE THEY DON'T HAVE A FIRST AMENDMENT? HE SHOULD LOOK IT UP. THEIR FREEDOM OF SPEECH IN CANADA IS NOT ABSOLUTE. THEIR GOVERNMENT CAN PASS LAWS THAT THEY FEEL ARE REASONABLE TO LIMIT YOUR SPEECH. HE SHOULD PROBABLY TAKE THAT. TRUDEAU, TRUE DAT. Jesse: SPARTA KAS WANTS TO RUN ON CANADA FIRST, LET HIM. Juan: PELOSI ISN'T POPULAR WITH REPUBLICANS, THEY CAN USE HER IN THE ADS. MITCH McCONNELL SAYING IF THE REPUBLICANS GET RETAIN CONTROL WE'RE GOING AFTER SOCIAL
