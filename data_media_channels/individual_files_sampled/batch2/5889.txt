and of course a former Trump political adviser categorically denying that he had any contact with Russians during the 2016 campaign and now Roger stone and another former campaign advisor Michael Caputo are reversing their accounts saying that they did have contact with at least one Russian who was trying to sell them dirt on Trump's 2016 opponent Hillary Clinton according to stones account to the Washington Post he met with a man who called himself Henry Greenberg who offered damaging information about Hillary Clinton in late May of 2016 however Greenberg did not reveal the information he claimed to possess Caputo who was working with the campaign at the time says he spoke with Greenberg by phone and arranged the meeting for stone text messages show that after the meeting Caputo asked Stone how crazy is the Russian stone said he wants big money for the info waste of time Caputo replied the Russian way anything at all interesting and stone said no neither disclosed that meeting and their testimonies to the House Intelligence Committee at the time completed I said he specifically told them he had no contact with any Russians I spent my time from the committee detailing the fact that I had no contact with Russians that I never heard have anyone in the Trump campaign talking with Russians that I never was asked questions about my time in Russia that I never even spoke to anybody about Russia I never heard the word Russia and we did not use Russian dressing well both stone and Kabuto say they had forgotten about the meeting for almost two years and so their memories were refreshed by text messages last month but they're also now claiming that they were set up because court documents show Greenberg said he'd worked as an informant to the FBI the post notes however that there's no evidence that Greenberg was working with the FBI and his interactions with stone I'm joined now by Michael Caputo the former Trump campaign advisor at the center of the latest development Michael thank you this if you were a juror on a jury and someone said they forgot in the midst of this Russian thing we've been talking about every night here and everywhere else for the last couple years and didn't remember for hearing from a guy who called himself Henry Greenberg pretty much the name of an American baseball player with a heavy Russian accent and you forgot that he not only got that call you forgot you told Roger stone about the call you forgot that you called Roger stone after he had this meeting with the guy you've read all three incidents forgot them all under testimony and only when your memory was sort of pricked by something that went in terms of texts did you remember it do you think you'd believe such a claim well if I believe if I heard what you just said I probably wouldn't believe it but you're categorically incorrect on a couple of items number one this was about two minutes of my life in 2016 I forgot about it and I recalled it in preparation for the meeting with the Senate Intelligence Committee on May 1st and the mulher meeting on May 2nd that's about it two years later two years later right and Waller asked me the same question precisely that was asked of me at the house in fact the the Muller investigator seemed to be reading it from my testimony from my house testimony he said the exact same question did any Russian ever offer you any information about Hillary Clinton approximately and I revealed immediately yes a man named Henry Bert Greenberg came to me and offered me negative information about Hillary Clinton and yadda-yadda and he was extremely disappointed that I answered it with full disclosure which I had not done in front of the house permanent Select Committee on Intelligence in July of 2017 we then got into some back-and-forth on this issue which made me believe very clearly that the mother team knew exactly when xx ting and after I left I started an investigation which is up now with Democrat dossier org and proved that Henry Greenberg is not his name he's got four Dame's and he worked as an anti informant for 17 years so tell me exactly the moment when it clicked on you that you had had two contact with this so-called self-identified Henry Greenberg the Russian when did it click on you oh yeah when that happened while I was preparing for the house I'm sorry for the Senate and the years later the mauler investigation probably about mid to the second week or late early third week what do you think I was in charge but in the midst of all this talk about the Russian influence on the 2016 election it did not jog your memory this memory did not come to the surface of your mind even in preparing for sworn testimony of the House Intelligence Committee it didn't come didn't occur to you did that's something like it didn't at all but first of all the only approach I got it do you think Rogers don't forgot all those three incidents you had shared with him that telling him about it be getting any reaction from both you guys forgot at all indeed in fact Roger didn't know until I reminded him when I figured it out before my move to the Muller team on May 2nd so you know Roger had the same inability to remember it for me it was a total of two minutes of my life and if we weren't reminded by those texts those texts were presented to me after I disclosed the meeting press so that's at categorically incorrect those of those texts are texts from Rogers telephone now frankly how they got away of Rogers text I don't know when you heard about the offer of the two for two million bucks you're gonna get some dirt on Hillary Clinton it was it made sense because it was early in the campaign Hillary is the favorite why did you decide or Roger decide that it wasn't worth the money even it would turn the election around if there was some real dirt there like money coming from Russia to Hillary or something like that I imagine that's what they were selling something to with finance what else could they be selling yeah according to the Washington Post this Henry Greenberg actually henry oginski which is actually Henry etc etc he's got four different names none of them are his birth name he told The Washington Post he was offering information from a Ukrainian friend who was employed by the Clinton Foundation and was fired and angry and had damning information that's why I would have find that alluring as well do you think you broke the law of course Chris I didn't hear any of this at all I didn't hear anything about money being two million dollars if you read the text that ended the whole thing with me and Roger it was about big money that's all I heard I didn't know about two million I didn't know about Ukraine and as far as I know but nobody knew about Ukraine until Henry Greenberg talked to the Washington Post last week it was were you aware at the time they're taking something from a value from another country would be illegal did you sense even that you sense even now it would be illegal to take dirt which it has campaign value from another country well first of all Henry Greenberg is an individual not a nation if he was a representing any nation he was representing the Federal Bureau of Investigation because he worked for 17 years as an FBI informant but in addition at the same time it doesn't matter if was a French Canadian who called me a German who called me at the time late May nobody's antennae were up about Russia well I wouldn't it wouldn't have even crossed my mind but if they were coming from a government I would have reported to the general counsel of the campaign immediately but it wasn't a government it was a crackpot as far as Roger figured out and we found out later after I got really interested in the questioning that proved that the mauler investigation knew more about it than me when I proved its up a Democrat Democrat dossier org the guy's been a an FBI informant for 17 years you know that mission he was working on a lunch break that day when he met for rock with Roger we're gonna have was no longer an agent for the FBI but let me ask you mitt how many how do we know have you we don't know we don't know proved without beyond a shadow of a doubt because he filed an affidavit with a an escort in California that he swore under oath that he was an FBI informant for 17 years but Chris he's an illegal alien only in this country on an FBI informant visa but you have your own credibility problems here I wouldn't be shooting arrows at anyone else because when you forget you had a Russian connection for two years that's astounding to people when they say Myka Foreman Chris well you're making that argument now B Foreman did why didn't you bring it to our attention the country's attention two years ago even if it was an FBI Informer shouldn't the country have known that you were dealing with the Russians we weren't dealing with the Russians we were dealing with God even us Berg you are connecting it with Roger you were the intermedia to get into nobody comes to this within listen Chris here's the facial on the phone with our chick you're fixed listen I know you're fixed on whether or not Roger and I were honest to the house permanent Select Committee on Intelligence I know that's where MSNBC is fixed right well I think that exposure we have no criminal exposure because we fulfilled our commitment and our responsibility to hypsi that's a fact but what you want to know is why you don't care if an FBI in front let you say is well Helen Russian criminal was sent into a white-collar investigation by James Comey because this whole thing that you're coming out with it this convenient time two years later the whole thing you're doing smacks of something like John Dean and the Nixon cover-up it's max they're bringing out information at your convenience because you're gonna make the case that you were used because you've well you know why did this convenient to me I'd let you a distinctly twice you're saying you were said I'll figure out but because it's part of a set of scenario twice I know what you didn't figure out what can you we have a delay here apparently because I keep getting interrupted I know that's not your normal thing so like me to answer now you've already told me that you remember all this two years late thank you Mike
