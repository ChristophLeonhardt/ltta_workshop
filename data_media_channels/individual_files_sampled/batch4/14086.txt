North Korea is threatening to cancel its summit with the United States but it doesn't look like we're taking them seriously North Korea is starting to saber-rattling n him jong-un is saying that he might cancel the summit with the United States next month if we continue joint military exercises with South Korea he's also saying via spokesman that if we keep demanding he denuclearize which was the whole reason he agreed to the summit in the first place as did we he might cancel it as well North Korea is this from a Newsmax story North Korea's first Vice foreign minister Kim kye-gwan that the regime was disappointed by provocative comments from the United States according to a statement published Wednesday Wednesday by the state-run Korean Central News Agency here's what they said what's this guy's name again Kim kye-gwan said quote if the Trump administration comes to the summit with a sincere intent who improved DPRK Democratic People's Republic of Korea us relations that it will deserve a good response but if it forces us into a corner by pushing for the abandonment of our nukes only in a one-sided demand and we won't have an interest in such talks anymore and we will consider whether to respond to an upcoming summit well that doesn't make much sense that seems to me to just be posturing for the North Korean people in other words we've already said to North Korea if you denuclearize we'll help you feed your people we'll help you expand your economy we'll bring in trade partners industrial partners like South Korea clearly and Japan and now Japan is is a major trading partner in the region to japan's the gdp is approaching five trillion dollars it's three times greater that of Russia so this means a sea change a whole new world literally in many respects for North Korea a statement added from Kim kye-gwan if Donald Trump that Donald Trump will remain as a failed president quote unquote failed president if he follows in the footsteps of his predecessors now earlier this morning North Korea time today Wednesday as North Korea abruptly canceled talks with South Korea and warned the u.s. to quote/unquote think twice about a trump summit with North Korean leader leader Kim jong-un scheduled Singapore there they're just trying to say faced with their own people now the State Department doesn't seem to care faith Department said quote we have not heard anything from that government meaning North Korea or the government of South Korea to indicate we would not continue conducting these exercise or would not continue planning for our meeting between president Trump and kim jeong-hoon next month that's from State Department spokesman folks person Heather Knauer hmm South Korea's a Yonhap news agency report yesterday that Pyongyang had cancelled high-level talks uh because of the what they called the max Thunder military exercises between the u.s. and South Korea now these exercises are planned long long in advance this isn't something that you know popped up and what was a slight on North Korea you don't just move ships and troops into a region in a week okay these were planned years in advance and we should undergo them because North Korea is not the only threat in the region we shouldn't not conduct our joint military exercises with South Korea a vital prety check and economic partner so that's what's gonna make North Korea leave the table good riddance uh the South Korean outlet Yonhap said quote what we read about this a little bit earlier but this is from the North Korean news agency quote the US will have to undertake careful deliberations about the fate of the planned North Korea u.s. summit in light of this provocative military ruckus ruckus ruckus just a bunch of a bunch of hooligans out there making a ruckus in the South China Sea I mean it's like I don't know who writes this stuff for North Korea is it 1952 now the these drills have been going on for a long time and what they really are they're a training exercise in the event north invade South Korea and if there were ever a time to conduct this drill not to he's conducting and to conduct this drill is now show North Korea that were using the Reagan doctrine of trust but verify that this is about peace through strength this is about peace through a guarantee that be might in wheat of the United States military will destroy you if you cross us and and we've you know the United States as a nation despite what the Liberals want you to believe they want you to believe China is more powerful and Russia's more powerful China's GDP as a GDP is almost half that of ours it's about ten to eleven trillion ours is 1718 trillion dollars Russia's is 1.5 trillion dollars our GDP is more than ten times greater than Russia's so we do your own research because it left in the left-wing media loves to fear monger he loved when Obama made it seem like the United States was weak and the United States needed to be a doormat and an appeaser and capitulate but we don't we're economically the strongest nation in the history of the world it will continue to be that GDP will grow as our oil and oil and natural gas exploration and production rise peaking in 2023 Russia's will continue to fall I'm gonna be talking on my other show today about new satellite imagery that indicates Russia and China are actually lying about their respective GDP s and so now the State Department responded to this North Korean statement and said quote there these military exercises are certainly not provocative Kim jong-un has said he understands the importance to the United States that we conduct these joint exercises they continue to go on and I love the Pompeo State Department I really really do because the Tillerson State Department would have insulted Trump the John Kerry State Department would have begged North Korea for forgiveness and told them we were gonna drydock our ships and the Hillary Clinton State Department would have been absent for comment because Hillary would've been out there looking for her next pay off but the Pompeo State Department says hey Kim told us something else we don't care about his internal propaganda the exercises are going on with our friends South Korea and if Kim doesn't like it too bad and he better he'd better get to the summit whether he likes it or not and this is exactly the way you have to handle bad guys in the world I predict this team this foreign policy team of Donald Trump Mike Pompeo and John Bolton will be delivering great winning results for years to come this is all really
