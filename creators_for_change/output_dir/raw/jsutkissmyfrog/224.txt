really mature to release and for such a

28
00:01:01,890 --> 00:01:05,430
kind of commercial age group that

36
00:01:17,729 --> 00:01:19,380
discussions in class about what's

37
00:01:19,380 --> 00:01:20,670
appropriate<font color="#E5E5E5"> for kids and what</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> people</font>

38
00:01:20,670 --> 00:01:22,860
think it's good<font color="#CCCCCC"> first certain age groups</font>

39
00:01:22,860 --> 00:01:24,000
and what<font color="#E5E5E5"> other people think isn't good</font>

40
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,049
for certain age group so it's a very

41
00:01:25,049 --> 00:01:27,360
little kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> space because you don't</font>

42
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:29,369
you know after the age of<font color="#CCCCCC"> eighteen year</font>

43
00:01:29,369 --> 00:01:33,689
eh and books to like<font color="#E5E5E5"> 40 to 45 year olds</font>

44
00:01:33,689 --> 00:01:37,890
or 30 year olds to 32 year old it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind</font>

45
00:01:37,890 --> 00:01:40,829
of a weird space because you know and in

46
00:01:40,829 --> 00:01:42,000
the same way<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you wouldn't assume</font>

47
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,649
adults horn food same things are at the

48
00:01:43,649 --> 00:01:45,390
same level of maturity or interested<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

49
00:01:45,390 --> 00:01:46,229
the same things you wouldn't really

50
00:01:46,229 --> 00:01:48,659
assume that of children so it's a weird

51
00:01:48,659 --> 00:01:52,439
weird publishing kind of sector to think

52
00:01:52,439 --> 00:01:53,939

00:05:33,210 --> 00:05:34,710
who gets taken to the<font color="#CCCCCC"> New World to</font>

157
00:05:34,710 --> 00:05:36,330
America and is in one of the first

158
00:05:36,330 --> 00:05:38,970
settlements and near Boston which is a

159
00:05:38,970 --> 00:05:41,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">really cool premise but I just felt like</font>

160
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:43,650
this was very factual and it it was kind

161
00:05:43,650 --> 00:05:45,570
<font color="#CCCCCC">of the narratives all about facts and</font>

162
00:05:45,570 --> 00:05:46,650
what was happening and not<font color="#E5E5E5"> really what</font>

163
00:05:46,650 --> 00:05:47,700
she<font color="#E5E5E5"> was feeling which</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is obviously</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

164
00:05:47,700 --> 00:05:49,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">know if you're younger you can't really</font>

165
00:05:49,020 --> 00:05:51,390
filter words you can't you can't always

166
00:05:51,390 --> 00:05:52,920
filter feelings into very good

167
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:55,200
adjectives but I felt we needed a few

168
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:56,670
more of those to make this a kind of

169
00:05:56,670 --> 00:05:59,970
good read and even though the<font color="#E5E5E5"> storyline</font>

170
00:05:59,970 --> 00:06:01,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">was interesting and kind of followed the</font>

171
00:06:01,350 --> 00:06:02,790
same kind<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> storylines the crucible</font>

172
00:06:02,790 --> 00:06:05,610
kind of thing and with which front

173
00:06:05,610 --> 00:06:07,740
trials and like people shouting at each

174
00:06:07,740 --> 00:06:09,180
other in villages saying that there are

175
00:06:09,180 --> 00:06:10,560
which<font color="#E5E5E5"> and these which and Tschida may be</font>

176
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:13,290
doing was my dollar yeah I love the

177
00:06:13,290 --> 00:06:14,520
packaging for this and I like<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

178
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:16,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">premise but I didn't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think it really</font>

179
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:20,220
worked and which is sad because I really

180
00:06:20,220 --> 00:06:21,900
wanted it<font color="#CCCCCC"> to last as</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> when I was invested</font>

181
00:06:21,900 --> 00:06:24,210
and really liking and but I don't know

182
00:06:24,210 --> 00:06:25,830
if<font color="#CCCCCC"> it was just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the kind of diary form</font>

183
00:06:25,830 --> 00:06:27,300
that kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> limited it I don't know if</font>

184
00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:29,100
it should have been told him in first

185
00:06:29,100 --> 00:06:31,230
person I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> this could have been a</font>

186
00:06:31,230 --> 00:06:33,630
third person but simplified language

187
00:06:33,630 --> 00:06:36,870
kind of thing might work better and but

188
00:06:36,870 --> 00:06:38,760
I<font color="#E5E5E5"> didn't feel the heart was in it and it</font>

189
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:40,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">was very</font>

190
00:06:40,030 --> 00:06:41,530
a lot of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> characters the characters</font>

191
00:06:41,530 --> 00:06:44,200
very distinctive and real and<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

192
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:46,270
language<font color="#E5E5E5"> is good enough to convince me</font>

193
00:06:46,270 --> 00:06:48,310
that she was writing from this time<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

194
00:06:48,310 --> 00:06:50,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">not from our time and pretending</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to be</font>

195
00:06:50,110 --> 00:06:52,930
from<font color="#E5E5E5"> that time that make sense and I</font>

196
00:06:52,930 --> 00:06:54,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">just I just I wasn't convinced</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> by this</font>

197
00:06:54,310 --> 00:06:58,150
then we go to sold sold oh my god I

198
00:06:58,150 --> 00:06:59,260
didn't think<font color="#CCCCCC"> I was gonna like this</font>

199
00:06:59,260 --> 00:07:00,370
because it had the kind of amnesty

200
00:07:00,370 --> 00:07:02,290
international sign on the back and it

201
00:07:02,290 --> 00:07:04,540
had this you know sold can she ever be

202
00:07:04,540 --> 00:07:06,400
free and this kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of imagery on the</font>

203
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:07,990
front<font color="#CCCCCC"> Reese it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> nice cover but also</font>

204
00:07:07,990 --> 00:07:09,700
made me<font color="#E5E5E5"> think oh this is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just gonna</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

205
00:07:09,700 --> 00:07:10,900
really tragic and it's gonna make me

206
00:07:10,900 --> 00:07:12,010
feel really bad but probably ain't gonna

207
00:07:12,010 --> 00:07:13,180
be a very<font color="#CCCCCC"> good piece of literature and</font>

208
00:07:13,180 --> 00:07:14,500
<font color="#CCCCCC">I'm gonna</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> want to hate</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it but not be</font>

209
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:15,760
able to hate<font color="#CCCCCC"> it because I'll feel bad</font>

210
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:17,110
because I'm white middle-class person

211
00:07:17,110 --> 00:07:19,990
living in the first world and it wasn't

212
00:07:19,990 --> 00:07:22,200
like<font color="#CCCCCC"> that at all it's about girl who and</font>

213
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:24,580
lives in<font color="#CCCCCC"> Nepal in a very poor village</font>

214
00:07:24,580 --> 00:07:26,950
and has<font color="#CCCCCC"> a very horrible stepfather and</font>

215
00:07:26,950 --> 00:07:29,260
trying to care for her mother<font color="#E5E5E5"> care for a</font>

216
00:07:29,260 --> 00:07:31,750
baby and family and deal with poverty

217
00:07:31,750 --> 00:07:34,210
and but in a really real way that's

218
00:07:34,210 --> 00:07:35,980
still like she has a character and she

219
00:07:35,980 --> 00:07:37,990
has a culture and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's all it's all very</font>

220
00:07:37,990 --> 00:07:40,090
vivid as a really vivid book even<font color="#E5E5E5"> though</font>

221
00:07:40,090 --> 00:07:41,770
this the woman who wrote it didn't live

222
00:07:41,770 --> 00:07:43,030
through it she just<font color="#CCCCCC"> did research which</font>

223
00:07:43,030 --> 00:07:46,120
is amazing because it<font color="#E5E5E5"> feels so real she</font>

224
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:47,520
gets what she thinks<font color="#CCCCCC"> is she's going to</font>

225
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:50,680
go and work and clean and stuff in India

226
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:52,210
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> she's not she gets kind of put over</font>

227
00:07:52,210 --> 00:07:54,100
the border and then sold into the sex

228
00:07:54,100 --> 00:07:56,800
slave trade really horrible and it's

229
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:59,530
quite graphic but also I think just

230
00:07:59,530 --> 00:08:04,410
about suitable for maybe 12 and up and

231
00:08:04,410 --> 00:08:07,420
just because it's it's awful in graphic

232
00:08:07,420 --> 00:08:10,210
and emotion and you know kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of scary</font>

233
00:08:10,210 --> 00:08:12,670
but also tasteful enough for it to be

234
00:08:12,670 --> 00:08:14,650
literature and not some kind of like

235
00:08:14,650 --> 00:08:16,270
ridiculous<font color="#CCCCCC"> painting that's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just going to</font>

236
00:08:16,270 --> 00:08:18,640
give people<font color="#E5E5E5"> nightmares so yeah I think</font>

237
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:20,560
<font color="#CCCCCC">it's as good vivid enough to understand</font>

238
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:22,480
this couldn't happen<font color="#E5E5E5"> to you right now</font>

239
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:25,110
<font color="#CCCCCC">and you're going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to hide in feel really</font>

240
00:08:25,110 --> 00:08:27,340
intimidated and scared but the same time

241
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:29,980
vivid enough to also have<font color="#E5E5E5"> a matter of</font>

242
00:08:29,980 --> 00:08:31,570
empathy with the main character even

243
00:08:31,570 --> 00:08:34,390
<font color="#CCCCCC">though and yeah the main</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> character also</font>

244
00:08:34,390 --> 00:08:36,220
not a master she's not completely a

245
00:08:36,220 --> 00:08:38,590
victim she is a victim obviously but

246
00:08:38,590 --> 00:08:40,360
like she's also a person and she has

247
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:41,980
characteristics<font color="#CCCCCC"> what sometimes doesn't</font>

248
00:08:41,980 --> 00:08:43,150
happen in<font color="#E5E5E5"> these kind of novel sometimes</font>

249
00:08:43,150 --> 00:08:44,770
they don't mean how many all there is

250
00:08:44,770 --> 00:08:46,150
there as their characters that are

251
00:08:46,150 --> 00:08:48,220
<font color="#CCCCCC">they're abused and that to me Frank</font>

252
00:08:48,220 --> 00:08:50,620
quite rude to people you who are victims

253
00:08:50,620 --> 00:08:52,600
because there are also characters with

254
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:53,270
facet

255
00:08:53,270 --> 00:08:54,890
and so I was really really<font color="#E5E5E5"> pleased</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with</font>

256
00:08:54,890 --> 00:08:57,110
this and I thought the language was and

257
00:08:57,110 --> 00:08:59,960
the language used was really<font color="#E5E5E5"> poetic and</font>

258
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:02,270
beautiful and very true to the style<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

259
00:09:02,270 --> 00:09:04,820
it was kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the pace of it was it</font>

260
00:09:04,820 --> 00:09:06,200
felt like even though it was really

261
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:08,270
eloquent in English and<font color="#CCCCCC"> offices written</font>

262
00:09:08,270 --> 00:09:10,760
in English it used a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of kind of</font>

263
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:13,910
really rich English language it also had

264
00:09:13,910 --> 00:09:16,520
the pace of something that was not of

265
00:09:16,520 --> 00:09:19,180
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> language and had had a very</font>

266
00:09:19,180 --> 00:09:21,680
different linguistic pace that made you

267
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:22,970
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay she</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is from a different</font>

268
00:09:22,970 --> 00:09:25,340
country and and<font color="#E5E5E5"> that was that made it</font>

269
00:09:25,340 --> 00:09:28,850
feel a more authentic and and beautiful

270
00:09:28,850 --> 00:09:31,040
be like I like when English doesn't roll

271
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:33,230
with the normal paces of an English

272
00:09:33,230 --> 00:09:35,420
person speaking it it's beautiful it's

273
00:09:35,420 --> 00:09:37,910
just this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> all ages in it I really</font>

274
00:09:37,910 --> 00:09:39,590
I was surprised by this I<font color="#E5E5E5"> wasn't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> going</font>

275
00:09:39,590 --> 00:09:42,230
<font color="#CCCCCC">to read this so glad I did unless</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> these</font>

276
00:09:42,230 --> 00:09:44,900
red tears by Joanna Kendrick and this is

277
00:09:44,900 --> 00:09:47,990
a book it from the back I'm gonna tell

278
00:09:47,990 --> 00:09:49,310
you what's about because the knee stirs

279
00:09:49,310 --> 00:09:51,050
<font color="#CCCCCC">jessica's discuss it if you don't want</font>

280
00:09:51,050 --> 00:09:52,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">else about it's okay but if you do want</font>

281
00:09:52,850 --> 00:09:53,750
<font color="#CCCCCC">to know it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about it's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> not going to</font>

282
00:09:53,750 --> 00:09:55,070
ruin the book for<font color="#E5E5E5"> you it's kind of</font>

283
00:09:55,070 --> 00:09:56,780
obvious if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you think about it but it's</font>

284
00:09:56,780 --> 00:09:59,420
called red tears and I think it's

285
00:09:59,420 --> 00:10:00,410
packaged really well because it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

286
00:10:00,410 --> 00:10:01,700
packaged like it's a book<font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font>

287
00:10:01,700 --> 00:10:02,840
self-harm but it is a book<font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font>

288
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:04,850
self-harm and on the back it's kind of

289
00:10:04,850 --> 00:10:06,740
like how this girl's life<font color="#CCCCCC"> is perfect but</font>

290
00:10:06,740 --> 00:10:08,900
then she had a secret it's not too

291
00:10:08,900 --> 00:10:10,610
obvious but it<font color="#E5E5E5"> is obvious to do with</font>

292
00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:12,410
blood so but I think that's good i think

293
00:10:12,410 --> 00:10:13,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's good</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that it's not packaged like</font>

294
00:10:13,790 --> 00:10:16,280
that because<font color="#E5E5E5"> i think it would reach more</font>

295
00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:18,140
people who aren't going to instantly

296
00:10:18,140 --> 00:10:20,390
reach for a book about self-harm because

297
00:10:20,390 --> 00:10:23,420
they're curious about it or and because

298
00:10:23,420 --> 00:10:24,860
they are self<font color="#E5E5E5"> harm me because this needs</font>

299
00:10:24,860 --> 00:10:26,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">to reach people who aren't self-harming</font>

300
00:10:26,210 --> 00:10:27,380
and people<font color="#E5E5E5"> aren't interested in it</font>

301
00:10:27,380 --> 00:10:29,450
because it breaks down a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the faux</font>

302
00:10:29,450 --> 00:10:31,730
paws about self-harm and it's a very

303
00:10:31,730 --> 00:10:33,650
educational book it's a good book I

304
00:10:33,650 --> 00:10:35,660
think it's a good book to give to people

305
00:10:35,660 --> 00:10:37,250
in schools and also to teachers in

306
00:10:37,250 --> 00:10:39,050
schools to tell to kind of show teachers

307
00:10:39,050 --> 00:10:41,420
not how<font color="#E5E5E5"> to not treat people who are self</font>

308
00:10:41,420 --> 00:10:42,800
harming because there are small for

309
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:44,810
teachers<font color="#E5E5E5"> in this you really don't get it</font>

310
00:10:44,810 --> 00:10:47,150
until you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> very bad training I don't</font>

311
00:10:47,150 --> 00:10:48,380
know why teachers don't have to do more

312
00:10:48,380 --> 00:10:50,780
kind of sociology and like social

313
00:10:50,780 --> 00:10:52,730
practice really<font color="#E5E5E5"> because they are</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> also</font>

314
00:10:52,730 --> 00:10:54,140
youth workers when you're working in

315
00:10:54,140 --> 00:10:55,400
school you deal with issues you don't

316
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:57,440
just teach anyway in seminar<font color="#E5E5E5"> we also</font>

317
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:58,310
talked about how it's really<font color="#E5E5E5"> good</font>

318
00:10:58,310 --> 00:11:00,140
because it's not about somebody who has

319
00:11:00,140 --> 00:11:01,550
massive problems in their life because

320
00:11:01,550 --> 00:11:02,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">sometimes there are books about</font>

321
00:11:02,660 --> 00:11:05,649
self-harm or suicide and and

322
00:11:05,649 --> 00:11:07,629
anorexic you and Stefan and the

323
00:11:07,629 --> 00:11:10,329
<font color="#E5E5E5">characters in them have anorexia will do</font>

324
00:11:10,329 --> 00:11:12,009
so hard because they are gonna be used

325
00:11:12,009 --> 00:11:13,600
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> their lies something really big</font>

326
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:14,559
happen in their life that's like

327
00:11:14,559 --> 00:11:16,389
something<font color="#CCCCCC"> that they can say look this is</font>

328
00:11:16,389 --> 00:11:17,379
what happen and this is why I'm

329
00:11:17,379 --> 00:11:19,269
self-harming but this<font color="#E5E5E5"> girl nothing that</font>

330
00:11:19,269 --> 00:11:21,399
bad happens to her that bad and that

331
00:11:21,399 --> 00:11:22,869
<font color="#E5E5E5">she's just going through her GCSEs and</font>

332
00:11:22,869 --> 00:11:24,100
she's finding it really hard and her

333
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:25,959
friends are being really<font color="#E5E5E5"> bitchy and her</font>

334
00:11:25,959 --> 00:11:27,399
parents are putting a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of pressure or</font>

335
00:11:27,399 --> 00:11:29,619
even though they love her and it<font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font>

336
00:11:29,619 --> 00:11:30,939
kind of builds up and it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> something</font>

337
00:11:30,939 --> 00:11:33,399
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's just kind of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> self-deprecating cycle</font>

338
00:11:33,399 --> 00:11:35,019
that builds to the self-harm it's not

339
00:11:35,019 --> 00:11:37,209
anything that you can really<font color="#E5E5E5"> speak up so</font>

340
00:11:37,209 --> 00:11:39,490
but I think that's good because<font color="#E5E5E5"> that is</font>

341
00:11:39,490 --> 00:11:41,019
what a lot of self-harm kind of is and

342
00:11:41,019 --> 00:11:43,240
that needs<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be represented in a non</font>

343
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:45,819
sensational non<font color="#CCCCCC"> epic kind of way</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

344
00:11:45,819 --> 00:11:47,649
saying<font color="#CCCCCC"> that I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> don't think it was a</font>

345
00:11:47,649 --> 00:11:48,819
well-written book I don't think<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's a</font>

346
00:11:48,819 --> 00:11:51,429
<font color="#CCCCCC">great piece of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> literature and it's iam</font>

347
00:11:51,429 --> 00:11:53,949
it's very bare in its language and not

348
00:11:53,949 --> 00:11:55,929
in a way that's true to the voice<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

349
00:11:55,929 --> 00:11:59,649
also the<font color="#CCCCCC"> characters seems to what I felt</font>

350
00:11:59,649 --> 00:12:01,660
was lacking is she literally interact

351
00:12:01,660 --> 00:12:03,699
doesn't interact<font color="#E5E5E5"> with any social media</font>

352
00:12:03,699 --> 00:12:07,779
<font color="#E5E5E5">or books or films or anything outside of</font>

353
00:12:07,779 --> 00:12:10,059
her periphery which is kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of like you</font>

354
00:12:10,059 --> 00:12:11,199
know that's what character does she just

355
00:12:11,199 --> 00:12:12,360
studies and stuff but there's no

356
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:14,559
reference<font color="#E5E5E5"> to a fact that she is thinking</font>

357
00:12:14,559 --> 00:12:17,860
bigger than her day and which I'm sure

358
00:12:17,860 --> 00:12:19,899
that she does in some ways like it's not

359
00:12:19,899 --> 00:12:22,209
I know you kind of get into<font color="#CCCCCC"> a cycle but</font>

360
00:12:22,209 --> 00:12:23,860
there's literally no reference to her

361
00:12:23,860 --> 00:12:26,529
having any kind of histological or out

362
00:12:26,529 --> 00:12:29,079
of body kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> thoughts at all which I</font>

363
00:12:29,079 --> 00:12:30,990
thought was a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little bit unrealistic and</font>

364
00:12:30,990 --> 00:12:33,610
yeah also it's just<font color="#CCCCCC"> very it's very</font>

365
00:12:33,610 --> 00:12:35,319
clinical in the way it's told which is

366
00:12:35,319 --> 00:12:37,870
good and it makes<font color="#E5E5E5"> it more immediate and</font>

367
00:12:37,870 --> 00:12:39,040
I was<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of addicted to this book to</font>

368
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:41,139
be honest I was going on in action wrong

369
00:12:41,139 --> 00:12:42,910
and I felt kinda stressed and I was

370
00:12:42,910 --> 00:12:43,990
reading it so<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's a kind of good</font>

371
00:12:43,990 --> 00:12:46,420
effect of it and at the<font color="#E5E5E5"> same time I</font>

372
00:12:46,420 --> 00:12:49,179
<font color="#E5E5E5">don't think it was a great piece</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

373
00:12:49,179 --> 00:12:51,339
literature but it is a<font color="#E5E5E5"> good</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> book and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm</font>

374
00:12:51,339 --> 00:12:52,990
glad<font color="#E5E5E5"> it exists and it exists very well</font>

375
00:12:52,990 --> 00:12:55,329
it also took me back to like when I was

376
00:12:55,329 --> 00:12:58,299
<font color="#CCCCCC">like 14 and 15 it gave really really</font>

377
00:12:58,299 --> 00:13:00,999
stressed about you know GCC's or before

378
00:13:00,999 --> 00:13:02,829
that fats and just like everything<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

379
00:13:02,829 --> 00:13:04,389
feeling<font color="#CCCCCC"> like everybody</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is telling me</font>

380
00:13:04,389 --> 00:13:05,439
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's the most important</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> thing in the</font>

381
00:13:05,439 --> 00:13:06,910
world and that's a horrible feeling i

382
00:13:06,910 --> 00:13:07,990
wish they hadn't all been saying that

383
00:13:07,990 --> 00:13:09,759
was<font color="#E5E5E5"> also from you know every adult you</font>

384
00:13:09,759 --> 00:13:12,009
meet thinks that the other adult hasn't

385
00:13:12,009 --> 00:13:13,299
said it nobody said<font color="#CCCCCC"> that to you today</font>

386
00:13:13,299 --> 00:13:15,009
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're like i know i have juice it</font>

387
00:13:15,009 --> 00:13:18,400
like leave me<font color="#E5E5E5"> that help maybe angry</font>

388
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:20,050
but so yeah that kind of made me stress

389
00:13:20,050 --> 00:13:22,060
and also made me<font color="#E5E5E5"> think about</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> low times</font>

390
00:13:22,060 --> 00:13:25,390
when I was like a teenager which is<font color="#CCCCCC"> week</font>

391
00:13:25,390 --> 00:13:28,210
<font color="#CCCCCC">I remember them until I get told about</font>

392
00:13:28,210 --> 00:13:29,590
them other people have them and then I'm

393
00:13:29,590 --> 00:13:31,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">like oh yeah I had really hard times</font>

394
00:13:31,420 --> 00:13:33,970
during GCC's and before that especially

395
00:13:33,970 --> 00:13:35,410
with friends sometimes in the SF and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

396
00:13:35,410 --> 00:13:37,630

398
00:13:39,130 --> 00:13:40,480
things which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is what was coming really</font>

399
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:43,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">sad but yeah I don't know yeah good and</font>

412
00:14:11,950 --> 00:14:13,660
