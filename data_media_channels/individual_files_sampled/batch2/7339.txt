Donald Trump held a rally in Billings Montana and it was really something he brought up the topic of impeachment which is interesting because many of the the Dems running in these races especially the leadership don't want to talk about impeachment doesn't mean anybody they isn't but they don't really want to focus on in terms of the campaigns but that's not the impression that Donald Trump is getting and so he spoke about this argument over his potential impeachment and also who would be to blame if he were to be impeached which you'll see in this clip they like to use the impeach would impeach Trump Maxine Waters we will impeach him but he didn't do anything wrong it doesn't matter we will impeach him you know I was thinking if that happened every time a Republican or a Democrat opposite got elected president so let's say a Democrat gets elected someday hopefully it's a long time but let's say a Democrat gets elected and let's say we have a Republican House we will appease that Democrat right and then the Republican and you do then what you're going to have is you have a country that's going to turn in to a third-world country because if the opposite party becomes president every time before it even starts before you've even found out whether or not he or she is going to do a great job they'll say we want to impeach them and you lap HM it's so ridiculous but worry about that if it ever happens but if it does happen it's your fault because you didn't go out to vote didn't go out that's what I'll give him or he did appear to be joking at least yeah so I my favorite part of this is can you imagine a scenario where a Democrat is president and the Republicans try to impeach him over something silly like maybe a consensual affair oh right that already happened did we forget that that already happened and he said throughout the rally he's like I mean how do you impeach a guy who's doing really well well first of all those two things are not at all connected so if you killed someone while the economy was doing well you still get impeached right and the Democrat who was in office when the Republic is impeached him over and something incredibly incredibly minor was presiding over an enormous ly successful economy stock market booming unemployment down the deficits down turned into surpluses so apparently it can be done and it was done by your party but he didn't do anything wrong who cares I do hear them say that a lot the Democrats he didn't do anything wrong but we're gonna impeach him no that was you so bad because I've never heard that and considering all that he's done from day one emoluments not you know divesting all of that there's I would say very little talk about impeachment honestly yeah Elizabeth yeah Elizabeth Warren brought up the 25th amendment but only as a result of someone inside of his White House bringing it up that's what it took I'm shocked that it's not more have an argument yeah I mean there there's a lot that you can focus on when you're crafting a message for change and I really am gravitating over to people who are buying the impeach shirts I like the impeach shirts I think they're great I think they're funny you should totally get one from the TYT store because they're fantastic but also I like all of the candidates who are just focusing on issues that people generally can support get behind agree with and that will benefit a lot of Americans and a lot of the people like the better O'Rourke's of the world are are focusing on the issues and I'm fine with that so Trump is just setting up a straw man of all these people who are like oh it's immediately gonna be an impeach it's that you know this the punchline was a joke but the setup was even more ridiculous that's what got me wait he could have taken the time he could have absolutely broken down everyone who has mentioned impeach and their reasons why and he could have come up with an argument against what they're saying but instead he just wraps it all up and something that isn't true they just want to do it for the sake of doing it I'd never did anything wrong or they're not saying I did anything wrong which is not yeah and so to the to the point of it not being true a couple things one Nancy Pelosi is literally fighting against impeachment every time they ask her about it she's like that's not what we're gonna do that's not a priority of ours we're not gonna talk about it in fact I think she's panicking in the in the wrong direction I don't need them to run their campaigns on impeachment I agree 100% with Brett wrote it on health care run it on economic dignity better wages that said that's what the American people care about on the impeachment is a responsibility if somebody if the president has done something wrong you can't shirk that responsibility because there's an election coming up and you think that all might energize Republican voters to vote against you and that actually seems to be Democratic strategy so Trump is actually saying the exact opposite of what the Democratic strategy is though over there are some Democrats that he mentioned like Maxine Waters and others who say yeah impeachment but overall Democratic leadership so no not impeachment not impeachment cuz they're afraid to rile up Trump's pace now I think that's silly but that is the that's the strategy that they're doing so it's the opposite of what Trump is saying and and then like his defense of the Republican Party as if like they would never do that like could you imagine if they back and forth I mean other than the fact that I just explained they did do it my god now imagine if Hillary Clinton had won but she wouldn't divest her money and then did some self-dealing and made deals with countries where she had personal investments and then she wouldn't release her tax returns so nobody ever knew what was in her tax returns on what other monies she could be making and then she did a deal with Indonesia and China and ZTE and then somebody wrote an op-ed saying I'm inside her administration as she's lost her mind and you should use the 25th amendment and I can go on for half a day you any idea how quickly the Republicans would have Beach two easy ways follow Young Turks want us hit the subscribe button down below then you're a TYT subscriber and second is ring the bell and when you do
