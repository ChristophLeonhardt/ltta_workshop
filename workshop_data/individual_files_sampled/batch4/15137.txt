here on campus unmasked we spend a lot of time talking about the assault on free speech on campus but it's important to remember that that's not the only First Amendment right under attack while it's not a public university and therefore doesn't have to uphold it Harvard University has led the charge on freedom of association punishing students who join frats and sororities let's take a look here are some ladies from Harvard University's Delta Gamma sorority or at least they were from the school's Delta Gamma sorority you see this month Delta Gamma became the first single gender group at Harvard to close because of the school's new rules prohibiting students in single gender groups from holding office in recognized student groups receiving Harvard's endorsement for prestigious accolades like the Rhodes Scholarship or even captaining varsity athletic teams at the school Delta Gamma Snell president Wilma Johnson Wilbanks said we respect the chapters decision and understand that the university sanctions resulted in an environment in which Delta Gamma could not thrive we sincerely hope this changes in the future so why penalize students he joined single gender groups in the first place well Harvard spokeswoman Rachel Dane had this to say Harvard College seeks to build a community in which every student can thrive and it does so on the foundation of a set of shared values including belonging inclusion and non-discrimination okay so this is super ironic coming from Harvard one of the most discriminatory and exclusionary institutions probably on the face of the planet and it's that lack of inclusion that makes it so distinguished it wouldn't exactly be Harvard anymore if they let's say diversify their admission process by picking an equal number of people with 2.0 GPA s as 4.0 GPA s now would it actually that might be exactly what the school is doing if it is in fact discriminating against Asian American applicants which I guess we'll find out in October and while Delta Gamma is the first Harvard single gender group to disband entirely because of these new rule the school has coerced others into accepting both guy and girl members Harvard students Russian sororities increased from 250 in 2012 to 286 in 2017 but plunged all the way down to only 100 this year listen fraud and sorority members do get access to advantages like exclusive parties and an exclusive networking pool for jobs after college but this holds for people from any group you might be able to outlaw meetups featuring the annoying little Greek letters Harvard but hopefully hopefully you and the media Hollywood and all the other progressive institutions won't be able to stop people with similar interests from coming together entirely for campus unmasked i'm rob from shocked if you like this video and support our mission please make sure to comment and subscribe if something happens on your campus and you'd like us to investigate send us details used in the forum on campus on mass comm
