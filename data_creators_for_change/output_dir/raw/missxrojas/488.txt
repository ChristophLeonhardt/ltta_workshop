00:00:01,620 --> 00:00:02,939
or who know me in the sense that you've

3
00:00:02,939 --> 00:00:04,440
spent more than five minutes with me

4
00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:05,850
will know that i<font color="#CCCCCC"> absolutely love</font>

chocolate here is a Venn<font color="#CCCCCC"> diagram</font>

00:00:07,290 --> 00:00:09,420
illustrating my love for things for

<font color="#CCCCCC">example books and chocolate are joined</font>

8
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:13,410
by the common theme<font color="#CCCCCC"> of things I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> love</font>

9
00:00:13,410 --> 00:00:14,700
more<font color="#E5E5E5"> than anything else in the universe</font>

10
00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:16,260
with the exception of vampire fiction

11
00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:18,119
and American chocolate which by the way

12
00:00:18,119 --> 00:00:20,490
is absolutely disgusting sorry you get

13
00:00:20,490 --> 00:00:21,900
to a certain<font color="#E5E5E5"> age I think when you made</font>

14
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:24,029
very aware of where things came from for

20
00:00:32,219 --> 00:00:34,770
preceded that with fiction with a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little</font>

28
00:00:48,030 --> 00:00:49,820

Cadbury's chocolate factory in

37
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:05,580
Birmingham and that was the source of

00:01:05,580 --> 00:01:07,619
much of his inspiration for Charlie

potter merchandising to fair trade you

50
00:01:26,670 --> 00:01:28,320
can sign a petition in support and<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

make the switch to<font color="#E5E5E5"> fair trade it doesn't</font>

57
00:01:39,299 --> 00:01:40,979
guarantee that all their ingredients are

58
00:01:40,979 --> 00:01:43,680
fair trade for example while the cocoa

59
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:45,869
beans in a chocolate<font color="#E5E5E5"> would be fair trade</font>

60

source cocoa beans the sugar in it might

61
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,560
not be from fair trade sources so it's

62
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:51,659
still a very murky area then there's

63
00:01:51,659 --> 00:01:53,250
lots<font color="#E5E5E5"> of other factors because everything</font>

64
00:01:53,250 --> 00:01:54,960
could be fair trade for the company you

65
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:56,969
buy your oil from might be cutting down

66
00:01:56,969 --> 00:01:58,580

68
00:02:01,370 --> 00:02:03,560
it's an important step and for those of

petitions never solve anything at least

71
00:02:07,190 --> 00:02:08,840
it gets the issue<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the table as harry</font>

72
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:10,758
potter fans we are the target consumer

of harry potter merchandising if we

00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:15,110
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> say who's going to in reality it's</font>

75
00:02:15,110 --> 00:02:16,970
in Time Warner's best interest in as

76
00:02:16,970 --> 00:02:18,980
much less practical change in people's

77
00:02:18,980 --> 00:02:20,630
lives it's also very symbolic it's

78
00:02:20,630 --> 00:02:21,980
showing<font color="#E5E5E5"> that they won't associate</font>

79
00:02:21,980 --> 00:02:23,990
themselves with exploitation with

80
00:02:23,990 --> 00:02:26,480
inhumane working conditions so<font color="#E5E5E5"> people</font>

81
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:28,610
get properly compensated for their work

82
00:02:28,610 --> 00:02:30,710
and not forgotten about by the wayside

83
00:02:30,710 --> 00:02:33,530
not treated as a mask as arguably the

84
00:02:33,530 --> 00:02:35,630
emblems are the fair trade allows people

85

to continue<font color="#E5E5E5"> working in their labor</font>

environment but in a veteran environment

87
00:02:40,340 --> 00:02:42,350
in a better structure<font color="#E5E5E5"> more viable</font>

structure of<font color="#CCCCCC"> ferrous structure honestly</font>

89
00:02:44,450 --> 00:02:46,220
no it's not going to solve the problem

90
00:02:46,220 --> 00:02:47,900
overnight<font color="#E5E5E5"> if Time Warner do decide to</font>

91
00:02:47,900 --> 00:02:49,340
make that shift to fair trade products

92
00:02:49,340 --> 00:02:51,830
but it's going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be a very very decent</font>

93
00:02:51,830 --> 00:02:53,540
step to getting a fairer system overall
