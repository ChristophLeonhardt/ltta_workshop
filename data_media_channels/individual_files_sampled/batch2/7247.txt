last night Donald Trump jr. was grilled by Sean Hannity for his apparent interest in working with the Russian government to help get his father elected I'm sorry I'm just having some fun it was Sean Hannity show which is a safe space for the Trump family and Trump went there and nowhere else because he knew he would be treated with kid gloves fit for him so we've got some videos of him explaining why he thinks that he didn't do anything wrong here's the first if there was something that came from it that was shady if it was a danger to national security I would obviously bring it right to someone but I didn't know what anything was it turns out it was nothing and therefore there's nothing to be able to actually talk the whole contact took how long how long was the meeting about 20 minutes or so about 20 minutes and Jared left after five or ten yes like she said and Paul Manafort was on his on his own the whole time pretty much pretty much it wasn't like I said it was nothing pretty apparent that this was not what we were in there talking about a lot of people gonna want to know this about your father hmm did you tell your father anything about that oh all right it was such a nothing there was nothing to tell yeah I wouldn't even remembered it until we start scouring through the stuff it was it was literally just a wasted 20 minutes which was a shame there's so there's two awesome things one is you have not committed a crime if you were on your cell phone while doing it if you ever murder someone hold the gun in one hand with the phone in the other yeah and the second one is that he really seems to think that if if it's proven that he didn't get anything from him and that has not been proven because we've seen the emails that he chose to leak we didn't see but the emails that came before that or after that which are probably gonna be very interesting but if he didn't find anything then he is in the clear that is not the case he expressed a clear desire after learning that this was a representative of the Russian government using information given by the Russian government he said I want it doesn't matter if you end up getting it that is the crime right there so that's part of conspiracy and so it was to take out Russia which is an an adversary of ours you know I they don't necessarily have to be but they kind of happened to be right but even if it was an ally it's a foreign government that you can't it takes so and goods from or stolen information from a value that brings two different laws so but imagine that it was al-qaeda and he's like look I just want to hear them out I went to al-qaeda said they had secret information on Hillary Clinton that could really hurt her campaign so I went and met with her because I wanted to hear them out that's not an excuse right now take out al-qaeda and put in Canada you actually have the same thing and and Russia's somewhere in between so it's a terrible excuse yeah and and then at the end there if you noticed he did not answer the question he asked now you didn't tell your dad did you like which is all these Hannity softballs now let's get you on record here saying all the right things done but he couldn't so he was kept looking away when he's asked a question that the classic lying thing yeah and look they're gonna keep saying that Trump didn't know about it there's some small chance at that that that is the case again it's really hard to say that this was an unimportant meeting to you when you decided to not only go without knowing the person as the son of the president but you decided to bring his son-in-law and chief adviser and his campaign manager for some reason you felt you needed to bring all those people even though it was a nothing meeting that you don't even remember that makes no sense but as Keith Olbermann has pointed out about a thousand times now in Twitter it's weird that within 10 minutes of the end of your meeting with this person that produced nothing your father began tweeting about the 33,000 emails of Hillary Clinton that have gone missing that is possibly just a coincidence but that's an interesting one so yesterday we showed you the video of Trump making this speech between the time that his son set up the meeting but before he actually had the meeting an image in in that interim period Trump did his feature is I go we're gonna get some information on Hillary you're gonna love it yeah and then it turns out they didn't get the information on Hillary and hence right after the meeting he starts saying and tweeting hey does anybody have those 30,000 emails that because they thought they were gonna get the 30,000 emails that Hillary Clinton deleted from the Russians yeah and so when they didn't get it from the Russians they're like damn it okay let's just ask for it publicly exactly let's turn to the video again just a little bit more from yesterday's interview did you hand over any and all documents well I will I've said it publicly I said it yesterday more than happy to cooperate with everyone I just want the truth to get out there that's part of why I released all the stuff today I wanted to get it all this is they're trying to drag out the story in all fairness you know they have it they want to drip a little bit today drip a little bit then so I was like here it is I'm more than happy to be transparent about it and I'm more than happy to cooperate with everyone so as far as you know as far as this incidents concerned this is all of it this is everything this is everything started by saying there are more documents being clear there then saying they want to drag it out in drip and drip and drip and thank God that they did because each time they did that he had to revise his story showing that he was lying from the beginning first of all that he didn't remember that it happened then that it was about adoption supposedly then that it was just about information was offered but I had no idea who is from and then it became clear that he knew exactly who was from it was from the Russian government if they had just done the whole thing at once we would not have gotten the clear trail of Lies from Donald Trump jr. so one of the things that I'm pissed about this story is that we made a master graphic here that accidentally makes Sean Hannity and Eric Trump look cool yeah okay Donald Donald Trump you really can't make it look cool Trump has never looked that cool yeah Hannity's never looked that cool so but yes to the to what you said John clearly I mean he's such a bad liar he says have you released everything I will yeah later it's everything dude keep your lies straight you're so dumb but by the way also and I know that the right-wingers watching this or hate this look at the like II don't call it white privilege if you want call it rich privilege you're facing potentially multiple criminal issues right there I'm happy to work together to resolve this issue no you have to work to resolve this issue because you might well have broken the law it's like I would love to talk to the police about that's if necessary no you need to because you're an idiot and you got yourself in this situation however there's more to this prevent defense than just Donald Trump going on state media last night you also have these reports being released by The Washington Post about what's gonna happen to the journalists that leaked this story or that that sorry I should say broke this story this is coming out of the White House their plan as one member of the team describes it is to research the reporters previous work in some cases going back years and to exploit any mistakes or perceived biases they tend to demand corrections trumpet errors on social media and feed them to conservative outlets such as Fox News although one admits that there is an issue with this the strategy saying the meeting happened it's tough to go to war with the facts but some people do some people have been engaged in a war on info for quite awhile you can maintain that for years yeah I actually disagree with that last advisor the concerns have been going to war with facts for a long long time and it's not just conservatives it's it's a very one of the oldest propaganda tricks which is that if you're attacked on something that is true counter-attack the messenger it doesn't like the substance of what happened the meeting with the Russians that collusion was that a crime not a crime was a conspiracy instead of don't worry about that if you can just attack the messenger and and smear them it will create it will confuse the audience you know I don't know but is that guy trustworthy the guy who broke the story now in this case Donald Trump jr. actually leaked the him emails himself she would have bet she knew the New York Times was going to imminently I know but my point is that the person who wrote the New York Times story then is irrelevant yeah because if you if you said oh you can't trust him to have accurately quoted the emails yeah and then you show other things he did wrong at least you'd have a leg to stand on but in this case the person who they got the information from is that much Trump jr. so you'd have to attack his credibility with which him to release in the information that yeah oh yeah but but but they will and they will muddy the waters and will work great well let's look at a little bit of that muddying the waters so not just Sean Hannity but let's look at the way Fox News decided to break some of this incredibly interesting information to their audience so far our review has identified key sections the crown prosecutor of Russia met with his father and in their meeting offered to provide the Trump campaign with some official documents and information that would incriminate Hillary and her dealings with Russia and will be very useful to your father it continues this is obviously very high-level and sensitive information I can also send this info to your father via Rhona but it is ultra sensitive so wanted to send to you first so that last paragraph there had the the classic dot dot dot that means there was something that didn't matter and you just you needed to fit all the words on one page they take it out but what they took out in that dot dot dot was that this information was coming from Russia and was part of the Russian government's plan to get your father elected weird that that's what they chose to take out of that paragraph and so you can have watched that as a Fox News viewer and have basically missed the entirety of that story thanks to their creative use of ellipses yeah they mentioned Russia only once but in the context of was Russia helping Hillary yeah I was in the emails they took out every other reference to Russia where Goldstone said this is from the Russian government and that they're supporting your father yes weird yeah this is why we call state media and that's exactly what how they Monte the waters so if you're watching Fox News you will scream to your friends and family no that doesn't do wrong choice or no Fox News or do you Milton Sarah shakes approach she's open you know right and and then later they'll attack the writers for the New York Times is there plan to do now and you'll go Paul did you know that go do once out of traffic ticket and - smoke weed when he was in seventh grade did you know that did you know that okay and I have family members and friends who come and say that stuff to us right because they hear that propaganda and they just put it out there until people go ah I don't know I can't tell who's right and who's wrong yeah and I know which team I'm on so I guess I'll just go with that support independent media
