49
00:01:22,089 --> 00:01:22,956

50
00:01:22,957 --> 00:01:24,824

00:01:32,299 --> 00:01:33,967

WEEKS.

56
00:01:34,268 --> 00:01:36,569
ONE IS KAVANAUGH AND THE OTHER

57
00:01:36,570 --> 00:01:40,440
IS CARAVAN.

58
00:01:40,441 --> 00:01:41,408
AND THE COMBINATION OF ANGER

59
00:01:41,409 --> 00:01:42,909
OVER HOW THE LEFT SMEARED,

60
00:01:42,910 --> 00:01:44,778

61
00:01:44,779 --> 00:01:46,846
ASSASSINATION, LIVE, USED

00:01:46,847 --> 00:01:48,214
BULLYING TACTICS WITH JUDGE

63
00:01:48,215 --> 00:01:50,417
KAVANAUGH IS GOING TO BE ONE

64
00:01:50,418 --> 00:01:51,117
PART OF THIS AND THE DEGREE TO

65
00:01:51,118 --> 00:01:55,355
WHICH THE LEFT IS EAGER TO HAVE

66
00:01:55,356 --> 00:01:58,725
3,000 PEOPLE IN A CARAVAN ACROSS

67
00:01:58,726 --> 00:02:00,026
THE AMERICAN BORDER, BREAK

68
00:02:00,027 --> 00:02:00,760
AMERICAN LAW, RECOGNIZING THAT

69
00:02:00,761 --> 00:02:03,830
IF THAT HAPPENS, THE NEXT

70
00:02:03,831 --> 00:02:05,231
CARAVAN WILL BE EVEN BIGGER IN

71
00:02:05,232 --> 00:02:07,033
THE CARAVAN AFTER THAT WILL BE

72
00:02:07,034 --> 00:02:08,601
EVEN BIGGER AND I THINK THE

73
00:02:08,602 --> 00:02:09,436
AMERICAN PEOPLE ARE GOING TO

74
00:02:09,437 --> 00:02:11,204
REJECT BOTH THE WAY THEY TREATED

75
00:02:11,205 --> 00:02:12,038
KAVANAUGH IN THE WAY THEY ARE

76
00:02:12,039 --> 00:02:15,008
DEALING WITH BORDER AND I THINK

77
00:02:15,009 --> 00:02:16,576
THOSE WILL END UP BEING THE

78
00:02:16,577 --> 00:02:19,412
REASONS THE REPUBLICANS KEEP THE

79
00:02:19,413 --> 00:02:20,180
HOUSE AND DRAMATICALLY INCREASE

80
00:02:20,181 --> 00:02:22,949
THE NUMBER OF SENATORS THEY HAV

81
00:02:22,950 --> 00:02:23,249
HAVE.

82
00:02:23,250 --> 00:02:24,617
>> Sean: MR. SPEAKER,

83
00:02:24,618 --> 00:02:25,285
ELECTIONS ARE USUALLY ABOUT

84
00:02:25,286 --> 00:02:27,020
PEACE AND PROSPERITY.

85
00:02:27,021 --> 00:02:30,623

EVERY MEASURE WE ARE DOING

87
00:02:31,992 --> 00:02:32,325
BETTER.

88
00:02:32,326 --> 00:02:34,127

89
00:02:34,128 --> 00:02:35,695
DEMOCRATS, IMPEACHMENT, BUT

90
00:02:35,696 --> 00:02:36,830
DON'T SAY IT.

91
00:02:36,831 --> 00:02:39,432
OPEN BORDERS, BUT DON'T SAY IT.

92
00:02:39,433 --> 00:02:40,834
WANT THEIR CRIMES BACK, THEY

93
00:02:40,835 --> 00:02:43,570
WANT OBAMACARE AND THEY WANT

94
00:02:43,571 --> 00:02:44,471
ENDLESS INVESTIGATIONS INTO

95
00:02:44,472 --> 00:02:44,771
TERM.

96
00:02:44,772 --> 00:02:46,206
I DON'T HEAR ONE THING THAT THEY

97
00:02:46,207 --> 00:02:48,675
ARE RUNNING ON THAT WOULD

98
00:02:48,676 --> 00:02:50,410
BENEFIT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE.

99
00:02:50,411 --> 00:02:50,777
OBAMACARE?

100
00:02:50,778 --> 00:02:55,415
A DISASTER.

101
00:02:55,416 --> 00:02:57,584
>> IF YOU LOOK AT THEIR

102
00:02:57,585 --> 00:02:59,452
PROPOSALS FOR GOVERNMENT RUN

103
00:02:59,453 --> 00:03:01,454
HEALTH CARE, WHICH WOULD BE

104
00:03:01,455 --> 00:03:04,991
IMPOSSIBLE TO PAY FOR, WOULD

105
00:03:04,992 --> 00:03:06,192
BANKRUPT THE SYSTEM, CRUSH THE

106
00:03:06,193 --> 00:03:09,229
ENTIRE HEALTH CARE DELIVERY

107
00:03:09,230 --> 00:03:09,963
SYSTEM AND DESTROY MEDICARE, YOU

108
00:03:09,964 --> 00:03:11,297
LOOK AT ALL THOSE THINGS, YOU

109
00:03:11,298 --> 00:03:13,066
HAVE TO WONDER WHAT ARE THESE

110
00:03:13,067 --> 00:03:15,635
PEOPLE THINKING?

111
00:03:15,636 --> 00:03:17,804
AND YET DEMOCRAT AFTER DEMOCRAT

112
00:03:17,805 --> 00:03:19,205
HAS SIGNED UP FOR A PROGRAM

113
00:03:19,206 --> 00:03:23,777
WHICH I THINK ABSOLUTELY WOULD

114
00:03:23,778 --> 00:03:24,978
COLLAPSE MEDICARE AND ABSOLUTELY

115
00:03:24,979 --> 00:03:29,015
WOULD ELIMINATE ALL OF THE

116
00:03:29,016 --> 00:03:29,616
EMPLOYER-BASED INSURANCE

117
00:03:29,617 --> 00:03:30,283
SYSTEMS, WHICH IS WHAT

118
00:03:30,284 --> 00:03:32,252
BERNIE SANDERS SAYS HE WANTS TO

119
00:03:32,253 --> 00:03:32,519
DO.

120
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:35,255
HE WANTS TO FORCE YOU AND ME AND

121
00:03:35,256 --> 00:03:37,824
EVERYONE ELSE INTO A SINGLE

122
00:03:37,825 --> 00:03:39,025
GOVERNMENT SYSTEM THAT HE GETS

123
00:03:39,026 --> 00:03:39,392

124
00:03:39,393 --> 00:03:41,795
>> Sean: LET ME ASK YOU THIS.

125
00:03:41,796 --> 00:03:42,829
I'M VERY HOPEFUL.

126
00:03:42,830 --> 00:03:44,330
I THINK THERE'S A REALLY GOOD

127
00:03:44,331 --> 00:03:46,599
SHOT -- RICK SCOTT, A GREAT

128
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:46,966
GOVERNOR.

129
00:03:46,967 --> 00:03:49,402
I REALLY FEEL CONFIDENT IN THE

130
00:03:49,403 --> 00:03:49,903
PEOPLE OF FLORIDA.

131
00:03:49,904 --> 00:03:50,670
I REALLY BELIEVE THAT JOSH

132
00:03:50,671 --> 00:03:54,607
HAWLEY WILL WIN, WHO WE JUST HAD

133
00:03:54,608 --> 00:03:55,408
ON FOR MISSOURI AS CLAIRE

134
00:03:55,409 --> 00:03:56,810
McCASKILL HAS BEEN EXPOSED AND

135
00:03:56,811 --> 00:03:57,777
THE SAME WITH BLACKBURN AFTER

136
00:03:57,778 --> 00:04:00,613
BRETT IS AND HAS BEEN EXPOSED

137
00:04:00,614 --> 00:04:01,614
AND I'M HOPING DEAN HELLER, THE

138
00:04:01,615 --> 00:04:03,383
LATEST POLLS HAVE HIM UP.

139
00:04:03,384 --> 00:04:04,217
HE'S ALWAYS IN A TOUGH RACE IN

140
00:04:04,218 --> 00:04:06,786
NEVADA AND I THINK HE'S IN

141
00:04:06,787 --> 00:04:09,622
TROUBLE IN MONTANA.

142
00:04:09,623 --> 00:04:10,824
HEIDI HEITKAMP IS NOW IN DOUBLE

143
00:04:10,825 --> 00:04:13,393
DIGITS, AS SHOULD BE IN

144
00:04:13,394 --> 00:04:14,294
NORTH DAKOTA, JOE DONNELLY IN

145
00:04:14,295 --> 00:04:14,994
INDIANA.

146
00:04:14,995 --> 00:04:16,863
I THINK WE CAN WIN EVERYONE OF

147
00:04:16,863 --> 00:04:17,396
THOSE RACES.

148
00:04:17,398 --> 00:04:19,399
THE ONLY THING THAT WORRIES ME

149
00:04:19,399 --> 00:04:21,033
TONIGHT, I DON'T KNOW ABOUT THE

150
00:04:21,035 --> 00:04:21,601
HOUSE.

151
00:04:21,601 --> 00:04:25,605
DON'T HAVE A BIG MARGIN THERE.

152
00:04:25,606 --> 00:04:27,140
>> LET ME ADD TO YOUR HAPPINESS.

153
00:04:27,141 --> 00:04:29,375
I THINK WE HAVE A REAL SHOT IN

154
00:04:29,376 --> 00:04:29,742
MINNESOTA.

155
00:04:29,743 --> 00:04:31,644
I THINK WE HAVE A REAL SHOT IN

156
00:04:31,645 --> 00:04:32,045
NEW JERSEY.

157
00:04:32,046 --> 00:04:34,614
THE SENATE COULD BECOME -- YOU

158
00:04:34,615 --> 00:04:37,150
REMEMBER IN 1980 WHEN I WAS

159
00:04:37,151 --> 00:04:38,818
WORKING WITH THE REAGAN TEAM, WE

160
00:04:38,819 --> 00:04:42,222
ENDED UP PICKING UP 12 SENATE

161
00:04:42,223 --> 00:04:44,757
SEATS, CONTROL OF THE SENATE,

162
00:04:44,758 --> 00:04:45,425
NOBODY EXPECTED.

163
00:04:45,426 --> 00:04:46,359
WE PICKED UP 12 SENATE SEATS IN

164
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:47,994
ONE NIGHT.

165
00:04:47,995 --> 00:04:50,630
SO THIS COULD BECOME A BIG

166
00:04:50,631 --> 00:04:50,964
BLOWOUT.

167
00:04:50,965 --> 00:04:51,998
THE HOUSE IS A LITTLE BIT OF

168
00:04:51,999 --> 00:04:52,732
TROUBLE BUT I THINK WHAT KEVIN

169
00:04:52,733 --> 00:04:54,567
McCARTHY IS DOING IN

170
00:04:54,568 --> 00:04:56,569
INTRODUCING A BILL TO GAIN

171
00:04:56,570 --> 00:04:58,071
CONTROL OF THE SOUTHERN BORDER

172
00:04:58,072 --> 00:05:03,276
AND I WOULD URGE KEVIN TO

173
00:05:03,277 --> 00:05:04,677
CHALLENGE NANCY TELL MIKE

174
00:05:04,678 --> 00:05:05,812
NANCY PELOSI TO A NATIONAL

175
00:05:05,813 --> 00:05:06,279
DEBATE.

176
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:08,615
LET HER DEFEND THE TOTAL FAILURE

177
00:05:08,616 --> 00:05:10,016
TO CONTROL THE AMERICAN BORDER,

178
00:05:10,017 --> 00:05:12,452
TO PROTECT AMERICAN SOVEREIGNTY,

179
00:05:12,453 --> 00:05:13,786
TO DRAW A LINE IN THE SAND AND

180
00:05:13,787 --> 00:05:17,624
SAY NO MORE, TO WELCOME CARAVANS

181
00:05:17,625 --> 00:05:19,659
AND ALSO A DELIBERATE EFFORT TO

182
00:05:19,660 --> 00:05:20,393
UNDERMINE THE AMERICAN SYSTEM

183
00:05:20,394 --> 00:05:22,262
AND LET KEVIN EXPLAIN THE BILL

184
00:05:22,263 --> 00:05:23,396
HE'S GOT THAT HE WANTS TO BRING

185
00:05:23,397 --> 00:05:25,932
UP IN DECEMBER THAT CONTROLS THE

186
00:05:25,933 --> 00:05:27,634
SOUTHERN BORDER.

187
00:05:27,635 --> 00:05:29,502
I THINK IF THE CHOICE IS THAT

188
00:05:29,503 --> 00:05:31,237
CLEAR, IF OVER HERE YOU'VE GOT

189
00:05:31,238 --> 00:05:35,041
SANCTUARY CITIES, MS-13,

190
