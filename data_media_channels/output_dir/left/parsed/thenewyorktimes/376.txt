Some people, they
just don't want
to leave their property behind.
There's a lot of looting
going on, and they're afraid.
They already lost a good
part of their belongings.
I really have had no use
prior on these trucks.
I had purchased them, pretty
much, for a customer of mine,
and basically got stuck
with them unwillingly.
But they came in pretty handy.
Saturday, Sunday,
all these past days,
we've been running
back and forth
in the southeast
side of Houston,
taking out a good amount
of people, families, kids,
elderly people.
Everybody out here
needs some help,
and we have the means to do it.
So we're going to stay at it.
