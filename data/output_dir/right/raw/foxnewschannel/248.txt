SANDERS, TED CRUZ.

19
00:00:40,645 --> 00:00:42,680
THIS IS A MOB THAT IS BEING

00:00:42,681 --> 00:00:46,150
INCITED BY PEOPLE LIKE MAXINE

IF ANY CONSERVATIVE DID TO A

DEMOCRATIC WOMAN WHO WAS DONE TO

26
00:00:53,992 --> 00:00:55,192
YOU, PAM, THERE WOULD BE FIRE

27
00:00:55,193 --> 00:00:58,362
AND FURY TO USE A PHRASE.

28
00:00:58,363 --> 00:01:00,531
>> THERE CERTAINLY WOULD, SEAN.

29
00:01:00,532 --> 00:01:01,765
AND IT'S THE CLASSIC DEFINITION

30
00:01:01,766 --> 00:01:02,666
OF A MOB.

31
00:01:02,667 --> 00:01:04,969
IF YOU LOOK UP WHAT A MONIES IN

00:01:04,970 --> 00:01:06,070
THE DICTIONARY, IT'S INCITING

33
00:01:06,071 --> 00:01:07,171
VIOLENCE.

34
00:01:07,172 --> 00:01:09,940
AND THAT'S WHAT THEY'RE DOING.

00:01:09,941 --> 00:01:11,408
I WAS BOOED AGAIN THE OTHER

00:01:11,409 --> 00:01:13,377

YELLED MY NAME LIKE THEY HAD WON

00:01:14,546 --> 00:01:16,413
THE LOTTERY, THE LOTTERY OF

00:01:16,414 --> 00:01:19,116
GETTING TO BE MEAN TO A HUMAN

40
00:01:19,117 --> 00:01:19,416
BEING.

41
00:01:19,417 --> 00:01:20,284
YOU KNOW THAT'S WHAT THE WORLD

42
00:01:20,285 --> 00:01:22,486
IS TURNING INTO.

43
00:01:22,487 --> 00:01:24,722
>> Sean: BUT THEY'RE DOING IT TO

44
00:01:24,723 --> 00:01:26,991
WOMEN, VT PEOPLE THAT SAY THAT

45
00:01:26,992 --> 00:01:29,193
THEY HAVE A MONOPOLY,

46
00:01:29,194 --> 00:01:29,894
COMPASSION, AND CONSERVATIVES

47
00:01:29,895 --> 00:01:30,728
DON'T.

48
00:01:30,729 --> 00:01:33,063
>> EXACTLY.

49
00:01:33,064 --> 00:01:34,164
>> Sean: I'M SORRY YOU HAD TO GO

50
00:01:34,165 --> 00:01:35,833
THROUGH THAT.

51
00:01:35,834 --> 00:01:36,500
OH, I'M NOT GOING TO BE A

52
00:01:36,501 --> 00:01:37,534
VICTIM.

53
00:01:37,535 --> 00:01:38,335
>> Sean: THIS IS NOW WHAT

54
00:01:38,336 --> 00:01:39,503
THEY'RE SAYING TO DO.

55
00:01:39,504 --> 00:01:41,105
WE'RE SEEING IT DAILY.

56
00:01:41,106 --> 00:01:43,574
AND IT IS A MOB.

57
00:01:43,575 --> 00:01:46,510
DEMOCRATS ARE INCITING THIS WITH

58
00:01:46,511 --> 00:01:47,745
THEIR WORDS IN MANY WAYS.

59
00:01:47,746 --> 00:01:49,146
>> THEY ARE.

60
00:01:49,147 --> 00:01:50,014
BUT I THINK THIS IS HAPPENING

61
00:01:50,015 --> 00:01:51,682
FOR A REASON.

62
00:01:51,683 --> 00:01:53,918
I THINK IN THIS TRUMP ERA WHERE

63
00:01:53,919 --> 00:01:56,487
NOW TRUMP JUST REFUSES TO BACK

64
00:01:56,488 --> 00:01:57,788
DOWN, TO THIS POLITICAL

65
00:01:57,789 --> 00:01:59,456
PRESSURE, THROUGH THE MEDIA, THE

66
00:01:59,457 --> 00:02:01,091
LIBERAL SWAMP, AND THESE

67
00:02:01,092 --> 00:02:01,825
ACTIVIST GROUPS, IT'S ENRAGED

68
00:02:01,826 --> 00:02:02,826
THEM.

69
00:02:02,827 --> 00:02:04,428
SHAWN, THE LEFT, FOR AS MUCH AS

70
00:02:04,429 --> 00:02:06,630
I DISAGREE WITH THEM

71
00:02:06,631 --> 00:02:07,998
IDEALOGICALLY, THEY'RE USUALLY

72
00:02:07,999 --> 00:02:10,334
TACTICALLY SMARTER THAN THIS.

73
00:02:10,335 --> 00:02:11,869
TRUMP HAS THEM MOVING IN

74
00:02:11,870 --> 00:02:12,770
SCATTERED, THEY DON'T KNOW WHAT

75
00:02:12,771 --> 00:02:14,772
TO DO ANY MORE, THEY'RE NOT USED

76
00:02:14,773 --> 00:02:17,875
TO A REAL POLITICAL FIGHT.

77
00:02:17,876 --> 00:02:19,910
REPUBLICANS -- ELECTED

78
00:02:19,911 --> 00:02:20,811
REPUBLICANS WOULD HAVE BACKED

79
00:02:20,812 --> 00:02:25,149
DOWN AND TRUMP REFUSES TO DO IT.

80
00:02:25,150 --> 00:02:26,216
>> Sean: LOOKING AT TED CRUZ

81
00:02:26,217 --> 00:02:29,954
WITH HIS WIFE, HE HAS TO ESCORT

82
00:02:29,955 --> 00:02:31,422
HIS WIFE AND ACT AS PROTECTION

83
00:02:31,423 --> 00:02:33,324
TO GET HER OUT OF THE

84
00:02:33,325 --> 00:02:35,659
RESTAURANT, DR. GORE KASHGS THEY

85
00:02:35,660 --> 00:02:38,095
CAN'T LET -- GORECA, THEY CAN'T

86
00:02:38,096 --> 00:02:41,031
LET PEOPLE SIT FOR FIVE MINUTES

87
00:02:41,032 --> 00:02:41,799
IN PEACE.

88
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:44,168
>> THINK ABOUT THE METRIC, THAT

89
00:02:44,169 --> 00:02:46,236
YOU RISK BODILY HARM IF YOU PUT

90
00:02:46,237 --> 00:02:48,505
ON A RED MAGA HAT IN MANY PARTS

91
00:02:48,506 --> 00:02:50,207
OF THE UNITED STATES.

92
00:02:50,208 --> 00:02:51,175
THAT'S ACTUALLY AN ACT OF

93
00:02:51,176 --> 00:02:52,576
COURAGE.

94
00:02:52,577 --> 00:02:55,713
THE LEFT WALKS AROUND IN

95
00:02:55,714 --> 00:03:00,184
T-SHIRTS, WITH CHE GUEVAR.

96
00:03:00,185 --> 00:03:02,152
A MASS MURDERER ON THEIR CHEST.

97
00:03:02,153 --> 00:03:03,787
WE DON'T DO ANYTHING TO THEM.

98
00:03:03,788 --> 00:03:06,123
THE MID TERMS ARE CRUCIAL.

99
00:03:06,124 --> 00:03:08,292
DO YOU WANT THE MOB TO RUN

100
00:03:08,293 --> 00:03:08,625
AMERICA?

101
00:03:08,626 --> 00:03:10,394
DO YOU WANT PEOPLE WHO WILL

102
00:03:10,395 --> 00:03:12,062
INTIMIDATE YOU IF YOU DO NOT TOE

103
00:03:12,063 --> 00:03:13,964
THEIR LINE?

104
00:03:13,965 --> 00:03:14,732
THAT'S WHAT THE NEXT 26 DAYS ARE

105
00:03:14,733 --> 00:03:17,901
WITH.

106
00:03:17,902 --> 00:03:18,569
ARE ABOUT.

107
00:03:18,570 --> 00:03:20,571
>> Sean: PAM, WHEN KANYE SAID

108
00:03:20,572 --> 00:03:23,674
TODAY THAT IT'S FREEING, REALLY

109
00:03:23,675 --> 00:03:25,943
IT IS A SIGN OF COURAGE, I'M NOT

110
00:03:25,944 --> 00:03:27,644
GOING TO -- I'M NOT GOING TO LET

111
00:03:27,645 --> 00:03:29,646
ANYBODY TELL ME HOW TO THINK AND

112
00:03:29,647 --> 00:03:32,249
WEAR MY "MAKE AMERICA GREAT

113
00:03:32,250 --> 00:03:34,151
AGAIN" HAT, HE COULD HAVE PULLED

114
00:03:34,152 --> 00:03:35,519
BACK ON THE CURSING IN THE OVAL

115
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:37,521
OFFICE, BUT WE'LL PUT IT ASIDE.

116
00:03:37,522 --> 00:03:39,056
MOST PEOPLE HAVE CURSED IN THEIR

117
00:03:39,057 --> 00:03:40,124
LIVES.

118
00:03:40,125 --> 00:03:42,292
BUT IT'S SAD THAT WE HAVE THE

119
00:03:42,293 --> 00:03:43,927
BEST, THE LOWEST UNEMPLOYMENT,

120
00:03:43,928 --> 00:03:46,330
FOR AFRICAN-AMERICANS, HISPANIC

121
00:03:46,331 --> 00:03:48,399
AMERICANS, ASIAN-AMERICANS.

122
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:49,533
AND SOMEBODY SAY GOOD JOB.

123
00:03:49,534 --> 00:03:51,769
LET DOZEN MORE OF THIS.

124
00:03:51,770 --> 00:03:53,037
>> AND KANYE IS A BUSINESSMAN,

125
00:03:53,038 --> 00:03:53,971
SEAN.

126
00:03:53,972 --> 00:03:55,072
HE'S A CAPITAL INTEREST.

127
00:03:55,073 --> 00:03:56,774
AND HE UNDERSTANDS THAT.

128
00:03:56,775 --> 00:03:57,775
HE'S SAYING LET'S MAKE MORE

129
00:03:57,776 --> 00:03:59,176
PRODUCTS IN THE UNITED STATES.

130
00:03:59,177 --> 00:04:00,844
HE GETS IT.

131
00:04:00,845 --> 00:04:03,013
HE KNOWS ALL OF THE GOOD THAT

132
00:04:03,014 --> 00:04:03,747
THE PRESIDENT HAS DONE FOR THE

133
00:04:03,748 --> 00:04:05,282
COUNTRY.

134
00:04:05,283 --> 00:04:07,151
AND KANYE WEST IS BRAVE.

135
00:04:07,152 --> 00:04:09,119
HE'S HIS OWN MAN, NOT SCARED TO

136
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:13,090
SPEAK HIS MIND AND WEAR HIS MAKE

137
00:04:13,091 --> 00:04:13,690
AMERICA GREAT AGAIN HAT.

138
00:04:13,691 --> 00:04:14,358
NONE OF US ARE GOING TO BE

139
00:04:14,359 --> 00:04:15,292
VICTIMS.

140
00:04:15,293 --> 00:04:16,293
TED CRUZ WAS OUT THERE

141
00:04:16,293 --> 00:04:17,727
PROTECTING HIS WIFE.

142
00:04:17,728 --> 00:04:19,195
EVERYONE IS GOING TO CONTINUE TO

143
00:04:19,197 --> 00:04:20,831
DO WHAT'S RIGHT.

144
00:04:20,832 --> 00:04:22,032
DESPITE WHAT THE FORMER CHIEF

145
00:04:22,033 --> 00:04:24,034
LEGAL OFFICER OF OUR ENTIRE

146
00:04:24,035 --> 00:04:24,802
COUNTRY SAID TO KICK PEEP WHEN

147
00:04:24,803 --> 00:04:25,769
THEY'RE DOWN.

148
00:04:25,770 --> 00:04:27,404
IT'S DESPICABLE.

149
00:04:27,405 --> 00:04:28,372
I KNOW ERIC HOLDER, HE SHOULD BE

150
00:04:28,373 --> 00:04:29,506
ASHAMED.

151
00:04:29,507 --> 00:04:32,409
>> Sean: I'M SURE I DON'T AGREE

152
00:04:32,410 --> 00:04:34,044
ON EVERYTHING WITH KANYE WEST, I

153
00:04:34,045 --> 00:04:37,781
DISAGREE ON STOP AND FRISK, IT

154
00:04:37,782 --> 00:04:38,115
WORKED.

155
00:04:38,116 --> 00:04:39,917
BUT I AGREE ON SAFER CITIES, I

156
00:04:39,918 --> 00:04:41,618
AGREE ON PRISON REFORM, MAKE

157
00:04:41,619 --> 00:04:42,519
PRODUCTS IN AMERICA AND CREATE

158
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:43,187
JOBS FOR AMERICANS.

159
00:04:43,188 --> 00:04:45,422
I'M ALL IN.

160
00:04:45,423 --> 00:04:46,557
>> SEAN, I HAVE BEEN VOCAL ABOUT

161
00:04:46,558 --> 00:04:47,724
THIS.

162
00:04:47,725 --> 00:04:49,860
I WISH A LOT OF ESTABLISHMENT

163
00:04:49,861 --> 00:04:51,128
TYPE REPUBLICANS WHO ARE SELLING

164
00:04:51,129 --> 00:04:52,696
THIS MOMENT SHORT WOULD TAKE A

165
00:04:52,697 --> 00:04:54,264
TIME-OUT AND THINK ABOUT THIS.

166
00:04:54,265 --> 00:04:54,998
WHERE HAVE WE FELL SHORT OVER

167
00:04:54,999 --> 00:04:56,266
THE YEARS.

168
00:04:56,267 --> 00:04:58,869
CULTURAL CAPITAL.

169
00:04:58,870 --> 00:05:00,637
DEMOCRATS BUILT UP A BANK

170
00:05:00,638 --> 00:05:02,339
ACCOUNT OF CULTURAL CAPITAL

171
00:05:02,340 --> 00:05:03,874
THROUGH HOLLYWOOD, AND WE HAVE

172
00:05:03,875 --> 00:05:05,576
PEOPLE SAYING HEY, THESE

173
00:05:05,577 --> 00:05:06,643
REPUBLICANS AREN'T CRAZY, SEE

174
00:05:06,644 --> 00:05:07,444
WHAT THEY HAVE TO SAY.

175
00:05:07,445 --> 00:05:10,114
IT'S A BIG DEAL.

176
00:05:10,115 --> 00:05:11,582
>> Sean: DR. GORKA, YOU CLEANED

177
00:05:11,583 --> 00:05:15,085
UP REALLY WELL.

178
00:05:15,086 --> 00:05:15,552
[LAUGHING]

179
00:05:15,553 --> 00:05:17,754
WE'LL GIVE YOU THE LAST WORD.

180
00:05:17,755 --> 00:05:20,624
>> LOOK, IT'S VERY, VERY SIMPLE.

181
00:05:20,625 --> 00:05:22,726
THEY HAVE NO POLICIES, THEY HAVE

182
00:05:22,727 --> 00:05:24,328
NO ARGUMENT, ALL THEY HAVE IS

183
00:05:24,329 --> 00:05:25,863
INTIMIDATION.

184
00:05:25,864 --> 00:05:26,663
AND WE WILL NOT LET THEM GET

185
00:05:26,664 --> 00:00:00,000
AWAY WITH IT.
