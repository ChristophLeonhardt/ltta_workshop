SHANNON.
>> Shannon: GARRETT TENNEY,
THANK YOU.
LET'S BRING IN REPUBLICAN
SENATOR FROM FLORIDA MARCO
RUBIO.
HE'S IN MARIETTA FLORIDA.
ONE OF THOSE CITIES CAUGHT RIGHT
IN HURRICANE MICHAEL SPAFFORD
SENATOR, THANK YOU FOR JOINING
US.
CAN YOU TELL US WHAT YOU SAW?
>> IT'S ABOUT AS BAD AS IT GETS.
I WAS THERE FRIDAY, PANAMA CITY.
HERE IN JACKSON COUNTY, YOU SEE
TREMENDOUS DEVASTATION IN THE
MAIN STREET, DOWNTOWN.
I WAS IN ANOTHER ROOM.
FIREFIGHTERS CAME OVER TO BE
HELPFUL.
THERE'S A LOT OF WORK THAT LIES
AHEAD.
PEOPLE NEED TO POWER BACK.
IT'S ABOUT REBUILDING THE ENTIRE
GRID.
A LOT THAT NEEDS TO BE DONE.
>> Shannon: ENCOURAGING TO SEE
CREWS FROM AROUND THE COUNTRY
AND THE SOUTHEAST GET IN THERE
AS QUICKLY AS THEY CAN.
LOOKS FROM THE IMAGES WE'VE SEEN
THERE ARE AREAS WHERE IT WILL
TAKE WEEKS, MONTHS, MAYBE YEARS
FOR THEM TO GET BACK ON THEIR
FEET.
>> TALKING ABOUT POWER, USUALLY
IN THE STORMS, LINES ARE DOWN
AND HE PUT THEM BACK UP AND YOU
START TO GET POWER ROLLING IN.
IN THIS PARTICULAR CASE COMMITS
A TOTAL REBUILD OF THE SYSTEM.
THERE IS STUFF EVERYWHERE.
MANY OF THESE STRUCTURES, YOU
CAN EVEN TURN THE POWER ON
BECAUSE IT COULD START A FIRE
AND HURT SOMEBODY.
YOU'VE GOT A CLEAR IT ALL OUT
FIRST.
IT'S A MULTIPLE WEEK EVENT,
MULTIPLE MONTHS AND IT WILL GET
BETTER EVERY DAY.
RIGHT NOW, IF THEY CAN GET POWER
AND BETTER COMMUNICATIONS UP AND
RUNNING, CELL PHONES WORKING AND
THE LIKE, EVERYTHING ELSE STARTS
TO FLOW.
THERE CREWS HERE FROM ALL OVER
THE COUNTRY THAT ARE HELPING.
OVER 200 PEOPLE WORKING ALMOST
ROUND-THE-CLOCK TO GET POWER
RESTORED AND THEN LONG-TERM, YOU
WORRY ABOUT FOR EXAMPLE THE
AGRICULTURE INDUSTRY.
FORESTRY INDUSTRY, PEANUTS,
COTTON CROP THAT WAS WIPED OUT.
THESE ARE PEOPLE THAT AREN'T
GOING TO MAKE ANY MONEY THIS
YEAR IN MANY CASES.
THE ECONOMIC DAMAGE THAT WILL BE
HERE LONG AFTER THE POWER IS
RESTORED AND EVEN SOME
STRUCTURES ARE REBUILT.
>> Shannon: ITS ENCOURAGING.
THOSE ARE MY FOLKS IN THE
PANHANDLE.
WATCHING THOSE COMMUNITIES COME
TOGETHER, THEY ARE TOUGH AND
THEY WILL ASSIST EACH OTHER.
NEIGHBORS WILL STEP IN BUT THEY
HAVE A LONG, HARD PATH TO GO.
I WANT TO ASK YOU PUT THE OTHER
TOP STORY ABOUT SAUDI ARABIA.
THINGS ARE CHANGING.
THE PRESIDENT TODAY, AFTER A
CALL WITH THE KING, SAID HE
ABSOLUTELY DENIED IT.
HE HAS SENT SECRETARY OF STATE
POMPEO THERE.
TRYING TO GET TO THE TRUTH.
THE PRESIDENT MADE MENTION OF
POTENTIALLY ROGUE KILLERS.
IT'S LANGUAGE THE PEOPLE THINK
THEY HE MAY HAVE GONE DIRECTLY
FROM THE SAUDI ADMINISTRATION.
YOUR DEMOCRATIC COUNTERPART IN
THE SENATE, CHRIS MURPHY SAID
"HEARING THE RIDICULOUS QUOTE
ROOM KILLER THEORY WHERE THE
SAUDIS WOULD GO WITH IT,
ABSOLUTELY EXTRAORDINARY THEY
WERE ABLE TO ENLIST THE
PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES
AS THEIR P.R. AGENT TO FLOAT
IT."
THE PRESIDENT HAS HAD SOME TOUGH
TALK.
I KNOW YOU HAVE AS WELL.
HOW DO WE GET THE VIOLENCE WAS
ON EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENED TO
JAMAL KHASHOGGI?
>> HERE'S WHAT WE KNOW.
HE WALKED INTO THAT BUILDING AND
THERE'S NO VIDEO OF HIM WALKING
OUT.
EITHER HE IS STILL IN THERE
SOMEWHERE OR HE'S DEAD.
THAT'S REALLY THE ONLY
EXPLANATION FOR IT.
IF THERE IS VIDEO OF HIM LEAVING
THE FACILITY, I THINK COMMON
SENSE TELLS YOU THE SAUDIS WOULD
HAVE PRODUCED IT.
WHO DID IT AND HOW THEY DID IT,
WHAT I THINK WE HAVE TO ASSUME
THE WORSE AND WE WILL SEE
THROUGH THE INVESTIGATION AND
INSIGHT THEY ARE PROVIDING
OTHERS WILL PROVIDE, WE WILL
KNOW MORE.
THE TURKS CLAIM THEY HAVE AUDIO
AND POTENTIALLY VIDEO.
IF THAT'S TRUE, WE WILL KNOW
ABOUT IT.
THE MOST IMPORTANT THING TO DO
IN THESE CASES IS TO WAIT FOR
THE TRUTH TO COME OUT AND WAIT
FOR THE EVIDENCE TO BE PRESENTED
AND WAIT FOR THE FACTS TO BE OUT
THERE BEFORE WE MAKE ANY
PRONOUNCEMENTS.
WE ARE DEALING WITH FOREIGN
GOVERNMENTS HERE, NOT JUST
INDIVIDUALS.
WHAT I HAVE SAID AND I WILL SAY
AGAIN, IF, IN FACT, THE SAUDIS
LURED HIM IN THERE AND THEN
KILLED HIM AND THEN DISPOSED OF
HIM AND HAVE BEEN BASICALLY
SITTING ON IT, IT'S GOING TO
HAVE AN IMPACT ON THE U.S.-SAUDI
RELATIONSHIP.
I CAN TELL YOU FROM A
CONGRESSIONAL PERSPECTIVE, IT
MOST CERTAINLY IS AND IT'S
UNFORTUNATE BECAUSE THEY ARE AN
IMPORTANT PART OF OUR
MIDDLE EASTERN STRATEGY TO
CONSTRAIN IRAN.
THAT CANNOT ALLOW US TO OVERLOOK
SOMETHING AS HORRIFIC AS THIS
IF, IN FACT, THAT'S WHAT
HAPPENED.
I DO BELIEVE EVENTUALLY WE ARE
GOING TO KNOW ONE WAY OR THE
OTHER.
>> Shannon: DAVID FRENCH
TWEETING "IT'S A REMARKABLE
EXTENT TO WHICH THE SAUDIS HAVE
ENGINEERED A STRATEGIC DYNAMIC
BY WHICH AMERICAN POLICYMAKERS
ACROSS MULTIPLE PRESIDENCIES
SEEM TO PRESUME WE NEED THEM
MORE THAN THEY NEED US."
THEY HAD HINTED THIS WEEKEND
THERE WILL BE REPERCUSSIONS
AGAINST ANYBODY WHO CAME TO
FALSELY ACCUSE THEM IN THE
SITUATION COME AS A WAY TO FIND
OUT THE FACTS.
THERE'S BEEN TALK OF HIKING OIL
PRICES AND THOSE KINDS OF
THINGS.
YOU KNOW HOW INTERTWINED WE ARE.
I ASKED THE PRESIDENT LAST WEEK
ABOUT STOPPING ARMS SALES.
IF SOMETHING THERE'S BEEN
BIPARTISAN SUGGESTION ON.
WHAT CAN CONGRESS DO IF IT TURNS
OUT THE SAUDIS ARE RESPONSIBLE:
>> THE ONE THING WE HAVE DONE IS
WE HAVE TRIGGERED A GLOBAL
MAGNITZKY INVESTIGATION.
IT'S NOT INSIGNIFICANT.
PEOPLE IN THE SAUDI GOVERNMENT
ENJOY ACCESS TO THE U.S. AND
GLOBAL MARKETS IN ORDER TO ENJOY
THEIR WEALTH.
THE ARMS SALES GETS A LOT OF
ATTENTION AND THAT MAY NEED TO
HAPPEN.
LIMITING THEM OR CUTTING THEM
OFF BUT ULTIMATELY THE SAUDIS
CAN BUY WEAPONS FROM SOMEONE
ELSE.
THE PRESIDENT IS RIGHT WHEN HE
SAYS THAT.
THAT MAY BE ANOTHER THING WE
LOOK AT.
THE DEEPER DYNAMIC IN ALL THIS,
IT'S NOT FOR THE OIL.
AMERICA PRODUCES OIL AS WELL AND
WE ARE ABOUT TO BE THE WORLD'S
LARGEST PRODUCER IF WE AREN'T
ALREADY.
I THINK THE BIGGER ISSUE HERE
BECOMES WITH THE ROLE THEY PLAY
IN OUR MIDDLE EASTERN STRATEGY.
THE ADMINISTRATION I THINK
WISELY HAS BUILT THEM AS A KEY
LINCHPIN AGAINST IRAN IN THEIR
OMISSIONS IN THEIR EXPANSION IN
THE REGION.
THAT'S ENDANGERED NOW.
IF THEY DID THIS, IT MAKES IT
IMPOSSIBLE FOR US TO WORK WITH
THEM IN THE SHORT TERM UNTIL
SOMETHING IS DONE ABOUT IT.
THAT'S A FACT.
OTHERWISE, HOW DO WE CRITICIZE
OUR ADVERSARIES AROUND THE WORLD
FOR MURDERING AND JAILING PEOPLE
IF WE OVERLOOK IT WHEN OUR
ALLIES DO IT?
IT IS A MESS ALL THE WAY AROUND.
I WISH IT HADN'T HAPPENED FOR
THAT MAN AND HIS FAMILY BUT ALSO
FOR GEOPOLITICAL REASONS.
BUT IT IS WHAT IT IS.
WE'LL HAVE TO ADDRESS IT.
>> Shannon: WE WILL STAND BY
AS WE WAIT TO GET THOSE FACTS.
WE WISH YOU ALL THE BEST IN THE
