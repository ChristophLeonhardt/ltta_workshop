1
00:00:00,229 --> 00:00:04,390
APPLE IS APOLOGIZING AFTER
CONFESSED TO SLOWING DOWN OLDER

2
00:00:04,390 --> 00:00:09,400
PHONES AFTER THEY UPDATE WITH
NEW SOFTWARE.

3
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:12,429
APPLE SAYS THEY DON'T DO THIS
INTENTIONALLY SO YOU ARE FORCED

4
00:00:12,429 --> 00:00:14,110
TO BUY A NEW PHONE, THEY SAY

5
00:00:14,110 --> 00:00:22,650
THEY DO IT IN ORDER FOR AN OLD
BATTERY TO BE ABLE TO POWER

6
00:00:22,650 --> 00:00:23,800
THE PROCESSOR.

7
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:24,920
I DON'T KNOW IF THAT
MAKES ANY SENSE.

8
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:27,149
I AM NOT A TECHNOLOGY PERSON.

9
00:00:27,149 --> 00:00:31,379
>> REALLY, I COULDN'T TELL?

10
00:00:31,379 --> 00:00:40,100
>> LET ME GIVE YOU AN
EXPERT'S REPORTING.

11
00:00:40,100 --> 00:01:11,860
SO BASICALLY IF YOU HAVE AN OLD
PHONE IT WILL HAVE AN OLDER

12
00:01:11,860 --> 00:01:17,880
BATTERY IN THAT OLDER BATTERY
MIGHT NOT BE ABLE TO KEEP UP

13
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:20,240
WITH THE NEW SOFTWARE.

14
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:23,681
THE IDEA IS IT KIND OF SLOWS
DOWN SOME OF THE FEATURES OF

15
00:01:23,681 --> 00:01:28,670
THE PHONE IN ORDER FOR THE
BATTERY TO KEEP UP.

16
00:01:28,670 --> 00:01:34,420
PEOPLE WERE IRRITATED TO SAY THE
LEAST BECAUSE EVERYONE SUSPECTED

17
00:01:34,420 --> 00:01:39,180
THAT AFTER YOU UPDATE THE NEW
SOFTWARE IT WILL SLOW DOWN AND

18
00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:40,390
SO SINCE SO MANY PEOPLE WERE

19
00:01:40,390 --> 00:01:45,970
UPSET AND SINCE SO MANY LAWSUITS
HAVE BEEN FILED APPLE SAYS THAT

20
00:01:45,970 --> 00:01:48,090
BATTERIES ARE CONSUMABLE

21
00:01:48,090 --> 00:02:04,750
COMPONENTS – NO.

22
00:02:04,750 --> 00:02:08,000
NOT GOOD ENOUGH.

23
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,989
THEY ARE ALSO GOING TO BE MORE
TRANSPARENT MOVING FORWARD.

24
00:02:10,989 --> 00:02:15,159
THAT WAS ONE OF THE BIGGEST
COMPLAINTS PEOPLE HAD.

25
00:02:15,159 --> 00:02:20,430
PEOPLE SAID BE TRANSPARENT
WITH THE CONSUMER.

26
00:02:20,430 --> 00:02:23,560
THEY SAY BEGINNING IN
2018 THEY WILL.

27
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:26,280
>> MY MAIN QUESTION IS DO YOU
BELIEVE THEM?

28
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:27,709
DO YOU BELIEVE

29
00:02:27,709 --> 00:02:31,359
THEY ARE PLAYING DOWN WITH
SLOWING DOWN YOUR PHONE JUST SO

30
00:02:31,359 --> 00:02:36,510
THAT IT WILL SAVE ENOUGH ENERGY
SO YOUR PHONE FUNCTIONS BETTER?

31
00:02:36,510 --> 00:02:39,499
OR SLOWING IT DOWN SO YOU
WILL BY ANYONE?

32
00:02:39,499 --> 00:02:41,109
>>I DON'T KNOW.

33
00:02:41,109 --> 00:02:45,940
I FEEL LIKE A CLOWN GIVING YOU
ANY TYPE OF SPECULATION.

34
00:02:45,940 --> 00:02:49,329
WHAT I DO KNOW IS THAT IF I GIVE
THEM THE BENEFIT OF THE DOUBT

35
00:02:49,329 --> 00:02:52,860
AND THEY ARE BEING HONEST THE
LACK OF TRANSPARENCY REALLY

36
00:02:52,860 --> 00:02:54,120
DOES IRRITATE ME AS WELL.

37
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:57,069
I WAS FORCED TO GO OUT AND
BUY A NEW PHONE.

38
00:02:57,069 --> 00:03:02,139
IF I HAD KNOWN ALL HAVE TO DO IS
REPLACE THE BATTERY, THEN I

39
00:03:02,139 --> 00:03:07,079
WOULD'VE DONE THAT INSTEAD OF
PURCHASING THIS IPHONE 10

40
00:03:07,079 --> 00:03:10,349
SITUATION THAT I DESPISE.

41
00:03:10,349 --> 00:03:16,180
I HATE IT.

42
00:03:16,180 --> 00:03:27,769
>> WE TALKED ABOUT THIS A WHILE
AGO, THERE WAS THIS ONLINE

43
00:03:27,769 --> 00:03:32,430
ANIMATED SERIES CALLED –

44
00:03:32,430 --> 00:03:35,900
SHE INTRODUCED THIS TERM TO
ME, OBSOLESCENCE.

45
00:03:35,900 --> 00:03:40,329
THESE COMPANIES HAVE ALREADY
BUILT IN PROGRAMMING AND PARTS

46
00:03:40,329 --> 00:03:42,269
THAT ARE SUPPOSED TO EITHER

47
00:03:42,269 --> 00:03:46,909
DESTROY THEMSELVES OR NOT
FUNCTION SUSTAINABLY FOR AN

48
00:03:46,909 --> 00:03:50,819
EXTENDED PERIOD OF TIME SO THAT
WE CAN REPLACE IT WITH THEIR NEW

49
00:03:50,819 --> 00:03:54,349
PRODUCT SO THAT THEY CAN
CONTINUOUSLY PUT PRODUCTS ON

50
00:03:54,349 --> 00:03:55,349
THE MARKET.

51
00:03:55,349 --> 00:04:01,549
IT SOUNDS THE WAY SHE DESCRIBED
PLANNED OBSOLESCENCE.

52
00:04:01,549 --> 00:04:04,169
BUT AGAIN I AM NOT A TECH
PERSON.

53
00:04:04,169 --> 00:04:07,599
I DON'T KNOW IF THEY ARE TRULY
BEING HONEST ABOUT THESE

54
00:04:07,599 --> 00:04:13,889
OPTIMIZATION APPROACHES TO MAKE
THE NEW PHONES RUN FASTER AT THE

55
00:04:13,889 --> 00:04:19,450
MERCY OF THE OLDER PHONES.

56
00:04:19,450 --> 00:04:23,410
BUT LIKE YOU I AM FRUSTRATED
THAT THIS HAS TO COME OUT

57
00:04:23,410 --> 00:04:27,160
THROUGH A THIRD PARTY REVEALING
THIS ABOUT APPLE AND APPLE NOT

58
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:29,660
COMING FORWARD AND SAYING THAT'S
WHAT OUR PHONES HAVE SLOWED

59
00:04:29,660 --> 00:04:33,070
DOWN, YOU HAVE FELT IT.

60
00:04:33,070 --> 00:04:37,500
LET'S WORK TOGETHER TO COME UP
WITH SOME SORT OF RESOLUTION

61
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:40,450
FOR PEOPLE TO MAINTAIN THEIR
RELATIONSHIP WITH US AS

62
00:04:40,450 --> 00:04:41,450
CUSTOMERS.

63
00:04:41,450 --> 00:04:44,910
>> I KNOW APPLE IS A COMPANY
THAT WANTS TO REMAIN

64
00:04:44,910 --> 00:04:48,760
PROFITABLE AND I RESPECTED.

65
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:51,760
EVEN WITH THEIR TRANSPARENCY
THEY WILL REMAIN PROFITABLE

66
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:55,140
BECAUSE NO MATTER WHAT THERE ARE
APPLE FANATICS ARE WILLING TO

67
00:04:55,140 --> 00:04:59,160
WAIT IN A LINE THAT IS FIVE
HOURS LONG JUST TO GET THE

68
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:00,700
NEWEST IPHONE.

69
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:08,620
I DON'T GET IT, I JUST WANT TO
KEEP MY OLD PHONE AS LONG AS I

70
00:05:08,620 --> 00:05:09,750
CAN.

71
00:05:09,750 --> 00:05:16,030
BUT OUR PHONES ARE NOW MORE
THAN JUST PHONES.

72
00:05:16,030 --> 00:05:20,590
OUR ENTIRE LIVES ARE ON
THIS DEVICE.

73
00:05:20,590 --> 00:05:23,960
I HAD TO GO TO A WORK-RELATED
TRIP ON THE EAST COAST WHEN I

74
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:26,420
STILL HAD MY IPHONE SIX AND IT

75
00:05:26,420 --> 00:05:28,170
JUST KEPT SHUTTING DOWN.

76
00:05:28,170 --> 00:05:32,030
I WOULD HAVE 40%
BATTERY AND IT WOULD SHUT DOWN.

77
00:05:32,030 --> 00:05:34,860
THEN I COULDN'T CHARGE IT.

78
00:05:34,860 --> 00:05:38,160
I AM NOT IN MY HOMETOWN AND
NOWHERE NEAR HOME.

79
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:41,920
I AM TRAVELING, MY PHONE IS NOT
WORKING, I HAVE ALL THE DATA I

80
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:45,940
NEED TO MAKE THIS TRAVEL
SITUATION RUN SMOOTHLY AND MY

81
00:05:45,940 --> 00:05:47,300
PHONE IS SHUTTING DOWN.

82
00:05:47,300 --> 00:05:49,840
THE TRANSPARENCY IS REALLY
IMPORTANT FOR ME.

83
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:52,910
THAT IS ME TALKING ABOUT A
PRIVILEGED PERSON WHO CAN

84
00:05:52,910 --> 00:05:55,500
AFFORD TO GO OUT AND BUY
A NEW PHONE.

85
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:58,930
WHAT ABOUT PEOPLE WHO CAN'T?

86
00:05:58,930 --> 00:06:02,680
THAT IS OUTRAGEOUS?

87
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:07,380
>> ALL THIS – YOU ARE NOT THE
ONLY PERSON, THERE WAS A CIRCLE

88
00:06:07,380 --> 00:06:08,670
OF PEOPLE AROUND ME WHO WERE

89
00:06:08,670 --> 00:06:10,830
EXPRESSING THEIR FRUSTRATION.

90
00:06:10,830 --> 00:06:18,090
IS THIS COLLECTIVE DETRACTION
FROM APPLE BEING A COMPELLING

91
00:06:18,090 --> 00:06:19,090
PRODUCT.

92
00:06:19,090 --> 00:06:22,820
THEY ARE LOSING CUSTOMERS AND
POTENTIAL PROFITS BY NOT

93
00:06:22,820 --> 00:06:26,460
SATISFYING YOU GUYS.

94
00:06:26,460 --> 00:06:29,710
THANKFULLY I GOT THE PHONE
BEFORE THIS WHOLE SHUTDOWN

95
00:06:29,710 --> 00:06:30,790
SITUATION HAPPENED.

96
00:06:30,790 --> 00:06:35,490
I SAW TONS OF PEOPLE EXPRESSING
OUTRAGE OVER HAVING TO DEAL WITH

97
00:06:35,490 --> 00:06:38,160
A NON-FUNCTIONING PHONE.

98
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:42,630
>> I LIKE APPLE.

99
00:06:42,630 --> 00:06:52,280
I HAVE AN IPHONE.

100
00:06:52,280 --> 00:07:01,020
BUT I AM WITH YOU, LUCKILY FOR
US I AM A TECH EXPERT.

101
00:07:01,020 --> 00:07:04,820
>>WRONG AGAIN.

102
00:07:04,820 --> 00:07:09,470
>> HERE IS THE OVERALL THING,
THEY TELL US THE HARDWARE, YOU

103
00:07:09,470 --> 00:07:13,070
HAVE TO KEEP BUYING NEW ONES.

104
00:07:13,070 --> 00:07:22,250
WE HAVE ALL THESE ENGINEERS.

105
00:07:22,250 --> 00:07:25,800
ON THE OTHER HAND, THE SOFTWARE
THAT YOU ARE HOOKED ON, YOU

106
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:33,550
HAVE YOUR MUSIC ON ITUNES, THAT
IS SOLID AS A ROCK.

107
00:07:33,550 --> 00:07:38,222
SO WHATEVER IS IN THE CLOUD OR
THE INFORMATION ATTACHED TO YOUR

108
00:07:38,222 --> 00:07:42,000
PHONE, THAT WORKS PERFECTLY
BECAUSE THAT IS WHAT HAS YOU

109
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,280
HOOKED.

110
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:50,990
IF YOU MOVE TO A KIND OF PHONE,
YOU HAVE TO GET ALL THE NEW

111
00:07:50,990 --> 00:07:56,220
NUMBERS, YOU HAVE TO GET
NEW MUSIC.

112
00:07:56,220 --> 00:08:03,780
BUT WHEN IT COMES TO THE
HARDWARE, OH DIDN'T SLOW DOWN?

113
00:08:03,780 --> 00:08:05,680
WHAT AN UNLUCKY BREAK.

114
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:12,840
AND 
SO I HAVE THIS GUT INSTINCT

115
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:15,140
WHICH A LOT OF YOU DID, EVEN IF

116
00:08:15,140 --> 00:08:26,340
YOU'RE NOT A TECH EXPERT.

117
00:08:26,340 --> 00:08:31,280
I DID THE UPDATES THAT EVERYBODY
WAS TELLING ME TO DO, BUT THE

118
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:36,489
UPDATES WERE PART OF THE
PROBLEM.

119
00:08:36,489 --> 00:08:37,490
>> IT HAS SECURITY FEATURES.

120
00:08:37,490 --> 00:08:40,899
THAT IS ONE OF THE GOOD THINGS
ABOUT APPLE PRODUCTS.

121
00:08:40,899 --> 00:08:45,100
I'M NOT GOING TO SIT HERE AND
SAY THEY ARE NOT TRACKABLE, BUT

122
00:08:45,100 --> 00:08:48,180
THEIR SECURITY UPDATES ARE
IMPORTANT.

123
00:08:48,180 --> 00:08:49,999
>>I KNOW.

124
00:08:49,999 --> 00:08:52,560
AND I JUST DID IT.

125
00:08:52,560 --> 00:09:09,990
NOW I HAVE 

126
00:09:09,990 --> 00:09:15,740
TO GO BUY A NEW
BATTERY BUT I HAVE TO WAIT UNTIL

127
00:09:15,740 --> 00:09:18,440
THE END OF JANUARY.

128
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:21,110
THEY ARE CHOOSING NOT TO FIX IT.

129
00:09:21,110 --> 00:09:24,750
I HAD THE SAME KIND OF EPIPHANY
YOU DID WHEN I READ THE STORY

130
00:09:24,750 --> 00:09:30,999
ABOUT THE AIRLINES AND HOW THEY
HAVE CALCULATED MISERY?

131
00:09:30,999 --> 00:09:35,309
>>THAT SOUNDS SO MUCH WORSE.

132
00:09:35,309 --> 00:09:38,910
>> TO MAKE YOU MORE MISERABLE
UNTIL YOU WANT TO GET ON THE

133
00:09:38,910 --> 00:09:43,149
PLANE FIRST AND THEN YOU NEED TO
GET ON THE PLANE FIRST.

134
00:09:43,149 --> 00:09:53,880
AND I THOUGHT THAT WAS WHAT I
WAS FEELING IN MY GUT.

135
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:58,009
AND IT IS NOT JUST APPLE, ALL
THESE GUYS ARE DOING IT TO

136
00:09:58,009 --> 00:09:59,149
MAKE MORE MONEY.

137
00:09:59,149 --> 00:10:06,889
WE ALL UNDERSTAND THAT, BUT THE
OFFICE PATIENT ABOUT IT AND ALL

138
00:10:06,889 --> 00:10:10,420
OF HER FRUSTRATIONS, OVERALL AT
SOME POINT IT WILL BE A BAD

139
00:10:10,420 --> 00:10:11,820
LONG-TERM STRATEGY BECAUSE OUR

140
00:10:11,820 --> 00:00:00,000
BATTERIES WILL START TO RUN OUT.
