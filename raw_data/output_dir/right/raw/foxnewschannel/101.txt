42
00:01:44,525 --> 00:01:47,127
MEXICO HAS ITS OWN INTEREST IN

65
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:27,267
THE ELECTION OF KAVANAUGH AND

66
00:02:27,268 --> 00:02:28,468

MEN FEEL LIKE THEY'RE BEING

70
00:02:34,809 --> 00:02:36,443
TARGETED UNFAIRLY.

71
00:02:36,444 --> 00:02:37,911
WHY IS THIS CARAVAN IMPORTANT

72
00:02:37,912 --> 00:02:40,814
BOTH TO MEXICO AND THE UNITED

00:02:53,194 --> 00:02:57,931
SUCH BIG DANGERS ABOUT THE

79
00:02:57,932 --> 00:02:58,265
COUNTRY.

80
00:02:58,266 --> 00:03:00,200
AND THERE ARE 179 MILLION PEOPLE

81
00:03:00,201 --> 00:03:02,068
WHO WOULD LIKE TO COME TO THE

00:03:20,421 --> 00:03:22,188
THEY DON'T LIKE TO CONTROL THE

93
00:03:22,189 --> 00:03:24,658
BORDER AND STOP IMMIGRATION.

94
00:03:24,659 --> 00:03:28,728
IN FACT, STACY ABRAMS, THE

GOVERNOR OF A GAH --

97
00:03:41,442 --> 00:03:44,210

JOBS.

105
00:03:54,055 --> 00:03:55,455
YOU'RE SEEING EXACTLY THE KIND

106
00:03:55,456 --> 00:03:56,690
OF MOB BEHAVIOR THAT THE

00:03:56,691 --> 00:03:57,891
DEMOCRATS HAVE LED TO.

108
00:03:57,892 --> 00:03:59,859

ANY GIVEN NIGHT, THERE ARE

112
00:04:04,332 --> 00:04:05,732
INDIVIDUALS OUTSIDE WAITING TO

00:04:05,733 --> 00:04:06,466
GET IN.

114
00:04:06,467 --> 00:04:08,134
THERE ARE NOT ENOUGH BEDS.

115
00:04:08,135 --> 00:04:09,436
THEY'RE ON THE STREETS.

116
00:04:09,437 --> 00:04:10,503

ISSUES, SOME NOT.

121
00:04:19,346 --> 00:04:21,213
THEY'RE JUST DOWN ON THEIR LUCK.

THEY SAY, LOOK, WE HAVE A LOT OF

00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:34,260
PROBLEMS HERE.

130
00:04:34,261 --> 00:04:35,628
WE'RE COMPASSIONATE PEOPLE.

131
00:04:35,629 --> 00:04:37,931
WE DO NOT WANT TO FEEL LIKE

00:04:37,932 --> 00:04:39,232
WE'RE BAD OR HORRIBLE PEOPLE

133
00:04:39,233 --> 00:04:40,800
BECAUSE WE DON'T WANT TO SAY,

00:04:54,015 --> 00:04:54,514
EVEN BLAME THEM.

143
00:04:54,515 --> 00:04:57,017
THEY KNOW IF THEY GET A FOOTHOLD

>> THIS IS AN INVASION.

147
00:05:02,390 --> 00:05:06,559
THIS IS AN ACT OF ATTACKING THE

THEY ARE PUTTING WOMEN AND

CHILDREN IN FRONT OF THE CARAVAN

174
00:05:59,380 --> 00:06:02,615
TO USE AS SHIELDS AS THEY MAKE

175

THEIR WAY THROUGH.

176
00:06:04,351 --> 00:06:07,153

191
00:06:36,817 --> 00:06:38,051
OTHER THE YEARS.

192
00:06:38,052 --> 00:06:40,153
IT KEEPS WAGES DOWN AND A LOT OF

193
00:06:40,154 --> 00:06:42,555
BUSINESSES ARE HAPPY WITH THAT.

194
00:06:42,556 --> 00:06:44,958
THEY GET CHEAP LABOR, PAY THEM

195
00:06:44,959 --> 00:06:45,258
CASH.

196
00:06:45,259 --> 00:06:47,193
AND IT'S GOOD FOR SOME OF THESE

197
00:06:47,194 --> 00:06:49,729
CONSTRUCTION WORK CREWS IN D.C.,

198
00:06:49,730 --> 00:06:53,166
MOST OF THEM SPEAKING SPANISH,

199
00:06:53,167 --> 00:06:55,034
HARDWORKING PEOPLE.

200
00:06:55,035 --> 00:06:57,237
BUT IT HAS HURT AMERICAN

201
00:06:57,238 --> 00:07:00,540
INDUSTRIES FROM LANDSCAPING AND

202
00:07:00,541 --> 00:07:02,275
PLUMBING, THE LIST GOES ON.

203
00:07:02,276 --> 00:07:05,311
>> I THINK THE WHOLE IMAGERY

204
00:07:05,312 --> 00:07:08,414
THAT YOU NOW HAVE THESE PEOPLE,

205
00:07:08,415 --> 00:07:11,050
FIRST OF ALL, THEY'RE POLITICAL

206
00:07:11,051 --> 00:07:11,417
ACTIVISTS.

207
00:07:11,418 --> 00:07:13,253
THEY'RE NOT REFUGEES.

208
00:07:13,254 --> 00:07:15,121
YOU RAISED THE QUESTION LAST

209
00:07:15,122 --> 00:07:17,857
WEEK, WHO'S PAYING FOR ALL THIS?

210
00:07:17,858 --> 00:07:20,293
THIS HAS GONE FROM 3,000 TO NOW

211
00:07:20,294 --> 00:07:23,663
WE THINK 5,000 PEOPLE.

212
00:07:23,664 --> 00:07:27,033
IT TAKES $7,000 A PERSON.

213
00:07:27,034 --> 00:07:27,767
WHO'S PAYING FOR IT?

214
00:07:27,768 --> 00:07:30,970
AND BY THE WAY, IF IT'S AN

215
00:07:30,971 --> 00:07:31,738
AMERICAN GROUP PAYING SOMEBODY

216
00:07:31,739 --> 00:07:33,573
TO BREAK THE LAW, THAT'S CALLED

217
00:07:33,574 --> 00:07:35,909
AIDING AND ABETTING AND THAT'S A

218
00:07:35,910 --> 00:07:36,209
CRIME.

219
00:07:36,210 --> 00:07:38,178
>> THE LUTHERAN AND CATHOLIC

220
00:07:38,179 --> 00:07:40,113
CHURCH DOES GET ABOUT $90

221
00:07:40,114 --> 00:07:41,447
MILLION TO RESETTLE MIGRANTS IN

222
00:07:41,448 --> 00:07:41,981
THE UNITED STATES.

223
00:07:41,982 --> 00:07:45,585
SO A LOT OF THE MIGRANTS ACROSS

224
00:07:45,586 --> 00:07:47,954
THE BORDER, WE CAN'T KEEP THEM,

225
00:07:47,955 --> 00:07:50,490
WE DON'T HAVE ANY HOUSING.

226
00:07:50,491 --> 00:07:53,393
THEY DID A GREAT REPORT ON THIS

227
00:07:53,394 --> 00:07:53,760
YESTERDAY.

228
00:07:53,761 --> 00:07:57,330
AND THEN THEY'RE TRANSPORTED ALL

229
00:07:57,331 --> 00:07:59,032
ACROSS THE UNITED STATES,

230
00:07:59,033 --> 00:08:01,234
SHELTERS PAID FOR BY THE

231
00:08:01,235 --> 00:08:02,702
CATHOLIC CHURCH, LUTHERAN

232
00:08:02,703 --> 00:08:04,571
CHURCH, OTHER ORGANIZATIONS.

233
00:08:04,572 --> 00:08:06,573
SO THERE'S AN INTERESTING

234
00:08:06,574 --> 00:08:09,375
REVOLVING DOOR OF CASH FROM THE

235
00:08:09,376 --> 00:08:12,946
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO THESE

236
00:08:12,947 --> 00:08:18,151
NGO'S AND 501C3'S.

237
00:08:18,152 --> 00:08:20,386
LET'S WATCH THE PRESIDENT IN

238
00:08:20,387 --> 00:08:20,687
MESA.

239
00:08:20,688 --> 00:08:22,956
>> RIGHT NOW, AS YOU KNOW,

240
00:08:22,957 --> 00:08:25,458
MEXICO IS ON THEIR SOUTHERN

241
00:08:25,459 --> 00:08:25,792
BORDER.

242
00:08:25,793 --> 00:08:27,460
THEIR SOUTHERN BORDER.

243
00:08:27,461 --> 00:08:28,795
AND THEY'RE FIGHTING.

244
00:08:28,796 --> 00:08:29,696
AND THEY'RE FIGHTING SOME BAD

245
00:08:29,697 --> 00:08:30,630
PEOPLE IN THAT GROUP.

246
00:08:30,631 --> 00:08:32,332
YOU SEE THE PEOPLE COME UP AND

247
00:08:32,332 --> 00:08:33,799
YOU LISTEN TO THE FAKE NEWS BACK

248
00:08:33,801 --> 00:08:37,737
THERE AND YOU THINK THEY'RE ALL

249
00:08:37,738 --> 00:08:39,973
--

250
00:08:39,974 --> 00:08:41,908
YOU THINK THEY'RE ALL WONDERFUL

251
00:08:41,909 --> 00:08:43,176
PEOPLE, RIGHT?

252
00:08:43,177 --> 00:08:43,977
NO, NO.

253
00:08:43,977 --> 00:08:45,678
YOU THINK -- I'M SERIOUS.

254
00:08:45,679 --> 00:08:47,380
YOU THINK THEY'RE ALL WONDERFUL

255
00:08:47,381 --> 00:08:47,714
PEOPLE.

256
00:08:47,715 --> 00:08:49,215
YOU'VE GOT SOME BAD PEOPLE IN

257
00:08:49,216 --> 00:08:50,650
THOSE GROUPS.

258
00:08:50,651 --> 00:08:52,118
YOU'VE GOT SOME TOUGH PEOPLE IN

259
00:08:52,119 --> 00:08:52,685
THOSE GROUPS.

260
00:08:52,686 --> 00:08:55,255
AND I'LL TELL YOU WHAT, THIS

261
00:08:55,256 --> 00:08:57,657
COUNTRY DOESN'T WANT THEM.

262
00:08:57,658 --> 00:08:57,957
OKAY?

263
00:08:57,958 --> 00:08:59,993
>> AND I THINK, AGAIN, AMERICA

264
00:08:59,994 --> 00:09:01,961
IS A WELCOMING COUNTRY.

265
00:09:01,962 --> 00:09:05,031
WE LOVE MERIT-BASED LEGAL

266
00:09:05,032 --> 00:09:05,431
IMMIGRATION.

267
00:09:05,432 --> 00:09:07,734
TRUE REFUGEES, A LOT OF

268
00:09:07,735 --> 00:09:09,335
CHRISTIANS IN THE MIDDLE EAST

269
00:09:09,336 --> 00:09:10,737
WHO HAVE A HARD TIME GETTING

270
00:09:10,738 --> 00:09:13,573
HERE, TRYING TO GET THE VISA

271
00:09:13,574 --> 00:09:15,475
LOTTERY, WHICH A LOT OF US WANT

272
00:09:15,476 --> 00:09:17,610
TO DO AWAY WITH.

273
00:09:17,611 --> 00:09:20,013
BUT HE'S RIGHT.

274
00:09:20,014 --> 00:09:20,880
AMERICA SEES THIS HAS GOTTEN

275
00:09:20,881 --> 00:09:21,914
TOTALLY OUT OF CONTROL AND IT'S

276
00:09:21,915 --> 00:09:23,616
JUST A QUESTION OF FAIRNESS TO

277
00:09:23,617 --> 00:09:24,717
THE AMERICAN WORKER.

278
00:09:24,718 --> 00:09:26,953
>> IT'S ALSO A QUESTION OF

279
00:09:26,954 --> 00:09:27,754
FAIRNESS TO PEOPLE WHO HAVE

280
00:09:27,755 --> 00:09:29,956
OBEYED THE LAW.

281
00:09:29,957 --> 00:09:32,558
>> WE ACCEPT MORE ILLEGAL

282
00:09:32,559 --> 00:09:33,893
IMMIGRANTS THAN ANY COUNTRY IN

283
00:09:33,894 --> 00:09:34,927
THE WORLD.

284
00:09:34,928 --> 00:09:37,397
THOSE FOLKS OBEYED THE LAW.

285
00:09:37,398 --> 00:09:38,631
THEY LOOK AT SOMEBODY WHO'S

286
00:09:38,632 --> 00:09:39,265
BREAKING THE LAW.

287
00:09:39,266 --> 00:09:42,435
AND THERE'S A RESENTMENT OF WHY

288
00:09:42,436 --> 00:09:44,637
ARE THESE PEOPLE ABLE TO BREAK

289
00:09:44,638 --> 00:09:46,539
THE LAW.

290
00:09:46,540 --> 00:09:48,508
>> FORMER OBAMA ADMINISTRATION

291
00:09:48,509 --> 00:09:49,976
OFFICIAL ON CNN TALKING ABOUT

292
00:09:49,977 --> 00:09:50,443
JOB GROWTH.

293
00:09:50,444 --> 00:09:53,813
SPEAKING OF THE MIDTERMS, I WANT

294
00:09:53,814 --> 00:09:55,715
TO PLAY THIS.

295
00:09:55,716 --> 00:09:58,351
>> THE JOB GROWTH HAS BEEN THE

296
00:09:58,352 --> 00:10:00,553
CASE FOR SIX YEARS.

297
00:10:00,554 --> 00:10:02,522
THE JOB GROWTH WAS ACTUALLY

298
00:10:02,523 --> 00:10:04,157
BETTER IN THE LAST YEAR OF THE

299
00:10:04,158 --> 00:10:07,460
OBAMA PRESIDENCY THAN THE FIRST

300
00:10:07,461 --> 00:10:09,996
YEAR OF THE TRUMP POLICY.

301
00:10:09,997 --> 00:10:12,498
SO HE'S BENEFITING FROM THAT.

302
00:10:12,499 --> 00:10:14,133
>> IT WAS BETTER UNDER OBAMA.

303
00:10:14,134 --> 00:10:16,135
>> SHE HAD A BETTER JOB UNDER

304
00:10:16,136 --> 00:10:16,436
OBAMA.

305
00:10:16,437 --> 00:10:19,472
LET'S START WITH HER.

306
00:10:19,473 --> 00:10:23,776
I THINK SHE HAD A BETTER JOB.

307
00:10:23,777 --> 00:10:27,280
LOWEST AFRICAN-AMERICAN

308
00:10:27,281 --> 00:10:29,182
UNEMPLOYMENT IN HISTORY.

309
00:10:29,183 --> 00:10:31,617
LOWEST LATINO EMPLOYMENT IN

310
00:10:31,618 --> 00:10:32,085
HISTORY.

311
00:10:32,086 --> 00:10:34,587
IT'S PRETTY HARD NOT TO BELIEVE

312
00:10:34,588 --> 00:10:36,055
THAT PRESIDENT TRUMP AND HIS

313
00:10:36,056 --> 00:10:38,057
POLICIES HAVE MADE A VERY

314
00:10:38,058 --> 00:10:40,193
POSITIVE IMPACT.

315
00:10:40,194 --> 00:10:41,361
THE ONLY MAJOR ECONOMY THAT'S

316
00:10:41,362 --> 00:10:42,729
GROWING RIGHT NOW IS THE UNITED

317
00:10:42,730 --> 00:10:43,062
STATES.

318
00:10:43,063 --> 00:10:44,464
NONE OF THE OTHERS ARE GROWING.

319
00:10:44,465 --> 00:10:45,732
AND I THINK THAT WE'RE DOING

320
00:10:45,733 --> 00:10:46,599
SOMETHING RIGHT.

321
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:48,301
BUT I ALSO THINK IT COMES BACK

322
00:10:48,302 --> 00:10:50,336
TO THIS QUESTION, WE WANT TO BE

323
00:10:50,337 --> 00:10:52,705
A COUNTRY THAT IS WELCOMING TO

324
00:10:52,706 --> 00:10:54,240
PEOPLE WHO WANT TO BECOME

325
00:10:54,241 --> 00:10:54,607
AMERICANS.

326
00:10:54,608 --> 00:10:56,476
AND WE WANT TO BECOME A COUNTRY

327
00:10:56,477 --> 00:10:57,877
THAT'S WELCOME

328
00:10:57,878 --> 00:11:00,113
THAT'S WELCOING TO PEOPLE WHO

329
00:11:00,114 --> 00:11:02,081
WANT TO OBEY THE LAW AND PLAY BY

330
00:11:02,082 --> 00:11:03,182
THE RULES.

331
00:11:03,183 --> 00:11:04,984
AND I THINK THIS WHOLE NOTION OF

332
00:11:04,985 --> 00:11:07,220
JOBS VERSUS MOBS IS REAL.

333
00:11:07,221 --> 00:11:10,189
AND YOU'VE SEEN IT HERE AT HOME

334
00:11:10,190 --> 00:11:11,190
WITH DEMOCRATIC MOBS.

335
00:11:11,191 --> 00:11:13,893
YOU'RE SEEING IT NOW WITH A MOB.

336
00:11:13,894 --> 00:11:16,696
AND THIS IS A VERY SERIOUS

337
00:11:16,697 --> 00:11:17,063
QUESTION.

338
00:11:17,064 --> 00:11:19,232
YOU'VE HAD SOME VERY STRANGE

339
00:11:19,233 --> 00:11:19,599
COMMENTS.

340
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:21,401
THE SENATOR FROM VIRGINIA WHO

341
00:11:21,402 --> 00:11:23,069
SAID WE OUGHT TO BE PUNCHING AND

342
00:11:23,070 --> 00:11:24,470
FIGHTING IN THE STREETS.

343
00:11:24,471 --> 00:11:26,038
THE FORMER ATTORNEY GENERAL SAID

344
00:11:26,039 --> 00:11:28,341
WE OUGHT TO BE KICKING

345
00:11:28,342 --> 00:11:28,741
REPUBLICANS.

346
00:11:28,742 --> 00:11:30,576
>> HILLARY SAYING WE CAN'T BE

347
00:11:30,577 --> 00:11:32,745
CIVIL UNTIL WE WIN AGAIN.

348
00:11:32,746 --> 00:11:34,080
BECAUSE THEY WERE SO CIVIL BACK

349
00:11:34,081 --> 00:11:34,380
THEN.

350
00:11:34,381 --> 00:11:35,915
>> WE NEED TO RECOGNIZE THAT

351
00:11:35,916 --> 00:11:37,917
PEOPLE NEED TO TAKE A DEEP

352
00:11:37,918 --> 00:11:39,419
BREATH AND ASK THEMSELVES WHAT

353
00:11:39,420 --> 00:11:40,319
KIND OF AMERICA DO YOU WANT TO

354
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:42,121
LIVE IN, AND YOU REALLY WANT TO

355
00:11:42,122 --> 00:11:44,657
LIVE IN AN AMERICA WHERE MOBS

356
00:11:44,658 --> 00:11:45,858
ARE GOING TO COME INTO YOUR

357
00:11:45,859 --> 00:11:47,760
RESTAURANT TO DRIVE YOU OUT OF

358
00:11:47,761 --> 00:11:48,060
IT.

359
00:11:48,061 --> 00:11:49,662
IS THAT REALLY WHAT YOU'RE

360
00:11:49,663 --> 00:11:50,797
COMFORTABLE WITH?

361
00:11:50,798 --> 00:11:51,998
>> I'M BEGGING THEM TO DO THAT

362
00:11:51,999 --> 00:11:52,598
TO ME.

363
00:11:52,599 --> 00:11:53,332
BRING IT.

364
00:11:53,333 --> 00:11:55,701
THAT'S ALL I CAN SAY.

365
00:11:55,702 --> 00:11:57,136
THIS IS PRESIDENT TRUMP TONIGHT

366
00:11:57,137 --> 00:11:58,938
SPEAKING ABOUT WHAT AMERICA

367
00:11:58,939 --> 00:12:01,140
ULTIMATELY OVER TIME TURNS INTO

368
00:12:01,141 --> 00:12:01,774
IF THIS CONTINUES.

369
00:12:01,775 --> 00:12:03,843
LET'S WATCH.

370
00:12:03,844 --> 00:12:05,778
>> THEY WILL TRY TO PLUNGE OUR

371
00:12:05,779 --> 00:12:08,781
COUNTRY INTO A NIGHTMARE OF

372
00:12:08,782 --> 00:12:09,315
POVERTY AND CHAOS.

373
00:12:09,316 --> 00:12:09,882
YOU KNOW THAT.

374
00:12:09,883 --> 00:12:12,218
IT'S GOING TO BE A MESS.

375
00:12:12,219 --> 00:12:15,321
DEMOCRATS WANT TO RAISE YOUR

376
00:12:15,322 --> 00:12:17,757
TAXES, IMPOSE SOCIALISM ON OUR

377
00:12:17,758 --> 00:12:21,761
COUNTRY, TURN US INTO A

378
00:12:21,762 --> 00:12:24,363
VENEZUELA, TURN US INTO ANOTHER

379
00:12:24,364 --> 00:12:24,730
VENEZUELA.

380
00:12:24,731 --> 00:12:28,201
>> NOW, THAT'S JUST AN

381
00:12:28,202 --> 00:12:28,634
OVERSTATEMENT?

382
00:12:28,635 --> 00:12:29,735
>> NO, I DON'T THINK SO.

383
00:12:29,736 --> 00:12:31,471
FOR EXAMPLE, THE DEMOCRATS SAY

384
00:12:31,472 --> 00:12:33,439
THEY WANT TO HAVE UNIVERSAL

385
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:36,542
HEALTHCARE FOR EVERYBODY.

386
00:12:36,543 --> 00:12:38,644
AND IN CALIFORNIA, THE GOVERNOR

387
00:12:38,645 --> 00:12:40,880
SAYS HE WOULD GIVE IT AWAY TO

388
00:12:40,881 --> 00:12:42,281
EVERY ILLEGAL IMMIGRANT THAT

389
00:12:42,282 --> 00:12:43,683
SHOWED UP.

390
00:12:43,684 --> 00:12:45,284
WELL, IF WORD WENT OUT

391
00:12:45,285 --> 00:12:46,319
WORLDWIDE, GET TO CALIFORNIA AND

392
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:47,787
THEY'LL TAKE CARE OF YOUR

393
00:12:47,788 --> 00:12:49,222
HEALTHCARE, THE SHEER COST OF

394
00:12:49,223 --> 00:12:50,790
THAT WOULD BREAK THE AMERICAN

395
00:12:50,791 --> 00:12:51,123
SYSTEM.

396
00:12:51,124 --> 00:12:52,825
AND I THINK WE NEED TO

397
00:12:52,826 --> 00:12:54,494
UNDERSTAND, THESE ARE FOLKS WHO

398
00:12:54,495 --> 00:12:57,463
DON'T HAVE A CLUE ABOUT THE REAL

399
00:12:57,464 --> 00:12:57,763
WORLD.

400
00:12:57,764 --> 00:12:59,565
WHAT THEY'RE FOCUSED ON IS

401
00:12:59,566 --> 00:12:59,866
POWER.

402
00:12:59,867 --> 00:13:01,634
THEY WANT POWER OVER YOU AND ME.

403
00:13:01,635 --> 00:13:03,903
THEY WANT POWER TO DEFINE HOW

404
00:13:03,904 --> 00:13:06,072
WE'RE ALLOWED TO BEHAVE, NOTHING

405
00:13:06,073 --> 00:13:07,440
ABOUT CREATING JOBS AND NOTHING

406
00:13:07,441 --> 00:13:08,474
ABOUT ECONOMIC GROWTH.

407
00:13:08,475 --> 00:13:10,142
>> THE DEMOCRATS TODAY ARE ALL

408
00:13:10,143 --> 00:13:12,411
UP IN ARMS BECAUSE OF PRESIDENT

409
00:13:12,412 --> 00:13:15,381
TRUMP'S COMMENTS LAST NIGHT

410
00:13:15,382 --> 00:13:18,484
ABOUT THE FORTE, HE'S MY KIND OF

411
00:13:18,485 --> 00:13:19,018
POLITICIAN.

412
00:13:19,019 --> 00:13:20,887
THIS IS AT A TIME WHEN KHASHOGGI

413
00:13:20,888 --> 00:13:23,389
WAS MURDERED AT THE CONSULATE IN

414
00:13:23,390 --> 00:13:25,324
TURKEY AND THE PRESIDENT IS

415
00:13:25,325 --> 00:13:27,793
SENDING A TERRIBLE MESSAGE ABOUT

416
00:13:27,794 --> 00:13:29,562
FREEDOM OF THE PRESS AT A TIME

417
00:13:29,563 --> 00:13:31,464
WHERE THE PRESS WAS ATTACKED

418
00:13:31,465 --> 00:13:32,164
OBVIOUSLY IN THIS MURDER.

419
00:13:32,165 --> 00:13:33,900
>> YES, AND I THINK THAT THE

420
00:13:33,901 --> 00:13:35,468
PRESS WILL ALWAYS BE HIGHLY

421
00:13:35,469 --> 00:13:35,868
SENSITIVE.

422
00:13:35,869 --> 00:13:37,203
YOU DON'T NOTICE WHEN WE TALK

423
00:13:37,204 --> 00:13:38,971
ABOUT HOW DANGEROUS IT GETS, HOW

424
00:13:38,972 --> 00:13:41,240
OFTEN THE PRESS ARE PREPARED TO

425
00:13:41,241 --> 00:13:43,342
SAY THERE WAS THE REPUBLICAN

426
00:13:43,343 --> 00:13:50,816
WHIP STEVE SCALISE WHO WAS SHOT,

427
00:13:50,817 --> 00:13:51,884
THAT IT WAS A REPUBLICAN

428
00:13:51,885 --> 00:13:54,120
HEADQUARTERS IN NEW YORK THAT

429
00:13:54,121 --> 00:13:56,355
ANTIFA DESTROYED.

430
00:13:56,356 --> 00:13:57,990
YOU DON'T SEE MUCH UNDERSTANDING

431
00:13:57,991 --> 00:14:00,359
IN THE PRESS ABOUT THE LEVEL OF

432
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:02,461
OPPRESSION FROM THE LEFT.

433
00:14:02,462 --> 00:14:04,230
>> CASIN

434
00:14:04,231 --> 00:14:10,903
>> CASTRO IS A CONGRESSMAN FROM

435
00:14:10,904 --> 00:14:11,804
SAN ANTONIO.

436
00:14:11,805 --> 00:14:14,307
HE SAID THIS ABOUT KUSHNER.

437
00:14:14,308 --> 00:14:18,377
>> THE REPORTING THAT KUSHNER

438
00:14:18,378 --> 00:14:19,645
MAY HAVE WITH U.S. INTELLIGENCE

439
00:14:19,646 --> 00:14:22,615
DELIVERED A HIT LIST, AN ENEMIES

440
00:14:22,616 --> 00:14:24,717
LIST TO A CROWNED PRINCE AND

441
00:14:24,718 --> 00:14:26,786
THAT THE PRINCE MAY THEN HAVE

442
00:14:26,787 --> 00:14:28,521
ACTED ON THAT AND ONE OF THE

443
00:14:28,522 --> 00:14:31,023
PEOPLE THAT HE TOOK ACTION

444
00:14:31,024 --> 00:14:33,192
AGAINST IS MR. KHASHOGGI.

445
00:14:33,193 --> 00:14:35,161
>> SO HE ORDERED A HIT?

446
00:14:35,162 --> 00:14:36,963
>> THAT COMMENT IS INSANE,

447
00:14:36,964 --> 00:14:38,030
LITERALLY INSANE.

448
00:14:38,031 --> 00:14:40,466
THE FACT IS KHASHOGGI IS A

449
00:14:40,467 --> 00:14:41,801
PUBLIC FIGURE.

450
00:14:41,802 --> 00:14:42,702
EVERYBODY IN SAUDI ARABIA KNEW

451
00:14:42,703 --> 00:14:43,703
WHO HE WAS.

452
00:14:43,704 --> 00:00:00,000
THE IDEA THAT AN AMERICAN HAD TO
