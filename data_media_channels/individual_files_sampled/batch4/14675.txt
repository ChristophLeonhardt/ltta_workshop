look up in the sky it's a bird it's a plane it's black Superman well because it's 2018 apparently it's time to racially rebrand the Man of Steel holy schizophrenia Alaska Bell is hanging up his cape and now the hunt is on for a new actor to play Superman enter the dastardly Lex Luthor or I mean to say the despicable social justice warrior Brigade who are clamoring to have Superman portrayed by a black actor even though he's being portrayed by a Caucasian since his comic-book debut in 1938 you know I especially loved the inflammatory headline advice quote Superman shouldn't be white end quote still waiting for that follow-up story you know black panther shouldn't be black I won't hold my breath on that one now the deck to the Vice pieces especially Ludacris namely quote because it never completely made sense to begin with end quote yeah it never made sense for Superman to be white what the hell let's follow the convoluted logic here the author notes that Superman's original creators Joe Shuster and Jerry Siegel were both children of Jewish immigrants and they allegedly embraced the goal that was not to just create some pale Christianized hero by the way the writer spells Christianized with a lowercase e which I find very revealing anyway according to this writer the idea was to create a Hebrew like Moses that would have been labeled a foreigner in his time within an American context Superman's characterization was an ideal wrapped in a possibility that anyone could become something great in America but given Shuster and Siegel's own experience with prejudice in the 1930s I mean we're talking about a time frame here in which Nazi Germany was in power pursuing the goal of cleansing Jews from the planet Jews were indeed the persecuted underdog some 80 years ago and as Caucasians themselves y-1 Shuster ccall depict their superhero creation in their own image it actually made perfect sense now having said that I wholeheartedly agree that the comic book industry has not been a model of diversity for much of its history in fact black characters did even come into prominence until the 1970s and those attempts seemed more like an exercise in blaxploitation for example it became downright goofy for a while that every new black superhero had the word black as part of his name such as black Goliath and black lightning but why we can see their skin color surely just plain old Goliath and garden-variety Lightning would have sufficed after all that guy in the red jumpsuit isn't called Caucasian daredevil yet these days instead of changing the race and even the gender of established iconic comic book characters how about we introduce new and interesting non-white and female characters or at least pay more attention to developing the Kulin diverse characters that already exists such as Black Panther and Luke Cage and storm also it's worth noting that when DC temporarily killed off Superman in 1993 he was later resurrected as four different supermen including steel who is a black Superman there was even a steel movie released in 1997 in which the titular character was played by Shaquille O'Neal the point is we already have a black Superman oh and for a short time there was even a Chinese Superman called new Superman which went over about as well as New Coke given that title was canceled earlier this year after just 24 issues by the way methinks DC really outsmarted itself with Chinese Superman I'm sure the launch strategy was like this hey boss China has a population of 1.4 billion people if we can get just 1% to buy Chinese Superman this will be the best-selling comic ever but talk about failure to launch not even the Chinese were buying what DC was selling in the weeks ahead it will be interesting to see if Warner Brothers caves into the demands of the SJW said who are also by the way clamoring for the next James Bond to be either black and/or female and if Warner does acquiesce to the demands of the PC crowd well then I say in for a penny in for a pound so how about we go all-in when it comes to an all new cinematic Superman in addition to skin colour let's change your sexual orientation and his religion in fact let's drop the super part of his moniker I mean super that kind of hints at American exceptionalism we can't have that these days right so how does a affirmative action person grab you holy rainbow or the rebel dot media I'm David the men's I'd Menzies hey folks the rebel has a brand new app please download that app and take the rebel with you wherever you go you
