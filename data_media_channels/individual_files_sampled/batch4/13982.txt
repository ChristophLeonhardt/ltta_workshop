the fake news media breathlessly reported over the weekend that the Trump administration has banned the Center for Disease Control and Prevention from using the words fetus transgender vulnerable science-based entitlement diversity and evidence-based the story predictably is not true but it should be true because that is the essential Trump project we will analyze the left's insidious abuse of language then at leisure crafts and Amanda press DiGiacomo joined the panel of deplorable x' to discuss how expensive it would be to legalize these so-called dreamers has that for euphemistic language Pope Francis's condemnation of fake news and speaking of fake news Al Franken's possible unrest Ignatian I'm Michael Knowles and this is the Michael Nolt show I have not slept in about 17 days I am coming in from a flight last night I had a red-eye on Thursday and then I had a red-eye last night so I got in at about 1:00 a.m. and I'm just I it's so nice the two things are so nice President Trump his administration and the news media because just when you think oh god what kind of show are we gonna have today I haven't been paying great attention to the news last day or so you get a big whopper like this this CDC story is the essential donald trump project but before we can get to that and there is a lot to analyze with then we have to talk about safety we got to talk about your neighborhood we have to talk about 21st century technology and thank our sponsors over at ring so rings mission is to make neighborhoods safer you know ring because they came out with a video doorbell that all of the cool guys got right away and then you thought of what is that oh you can see there's a little video doorbell and you can see who's at your door from anywhere so you can be in the studio you can be at work you can be on vacation sitting at the beach and it'll pop up on your phone and you can talk to them you can see when someone's trying to break into your house to see you doctor delivery man you know you see what's actually happening and they know that home security begins at the front door but it doesn't end there so now they're extending that same level of security to the rest of your home with the ring floodlight camera so it's just like the doorbell the doorbell allows you to see who is there and you know whether you want to go let them in or not the floodlight cam is a motion-activated camera and floodlight that connects right to your phone with HD video and to wait audio and lets you know the moment anyone steps onto your property now for some of my listeners is gonna help you secure your home and make sure that no one breaks in and for some of my listeners it's gonna scare you away because you know when you go to try to break into someone's house that light is gonna come on they're gonna see you even if you take the floodlight camera even if you take the ring doorbell it is all uploaded to the cloud so they're gonna get you this is really amazing in the old days they used to have neighborhood watches and they said more burglaries - and and this is just 21st century technology so they did a little experiment ring in Los Angeles and I'm not great neighborhood of LA ring gave out a bunch of its project product and within six months they noticed a 55% reduction in home burglaries I think that's the number that is pretty amazing so you can see and speak to visitors even set off an alarm right from your phone with the floodlight camera with the doorbell when things go bump in the night you'll immediately know what it is whether you're home or away it lets you keep an eye on your home from anywhere it's the ultimate in home security seriously this is the 21st century it is unbelievable how affordable this technology is this would have been unheard of even just a few years ago go out and get it it is a really really cool product and you can save up to $150 off of a ring home security kit right now when you go to ring.com slash Noles that's KO wles just like beyonce ring.com slash Knowles what is it that is ring comm / Knowles okay we have got to get into this CDC thing because this is what PC is all about and it's largely why Donald Trump was elected president The Washington Post ran a fake story over the weekend which is not exactly manned by its dog is it but the headline goes like this CDC gets list of forbidden words fetus transgender diversity that is fake news that headline is not true no words have been banned for used by the Trump administration but that makes sense when the Washington Post runs a headline assume the opposite is true now at most there is some kernel of truth here at most agencies like the CDC had been directed to avoid a certain language in budget proposals to facilitate funding from the republican-controlled Congress which makes sense the you want certain language to make it easier to pass these bills but the story itself is absurd so what happened to Nancy Pelosi and typically untrue and hysterical fashion tweeted out danger all caps Trump admin is going further down a dangerous and unamerican path of word and thought control POTUS has no respect for and has banned words this is that is truly unbelievable this is total projection it's Nancy Pelosi looking in the mirror and then throwing that on to Donald Trump now federal officials former Obama appointees they've shrieked that the imaginary band was Orwellian and stupid but it doesn't end there here is for comment President Trump I know words I had the best words I have to but there's no better words than stupid well said absolutely right unfortunately though unfortunately there is no government-wide language recommendation this is just a directive regarding certain budget documents the words in question by the way our fetus transgender vulnerable science-based entitlement diversity and evidence-based and by the way it's too bad that there are no government-wide language recommendations here because all of those words that I just said are empty slogans their insidious they are politically correct euphemisms intended to obscure what they really mean so let's start with fetus what does fetus we use fetus to mean something that isn't a human being so we can kill it but fetus comes from the latin for offspring that's all the word means why not call it an unborn baby why not call it offspring because the word fetus allows you to make the baby seem clinical seem not human seem not alive we know two things about unborn babies they're human and they're alive but we need to wash over that we need to obscure that language with muddy latin at words so we don't really know it's a fetus don't worry we can kill it it's just a fetus thing with trans gender now the the modifier trans means across or beyond right doesn't so it actually doesn't even make sense in the way they're using it which is a man who thinks he's a woman or vice versa or really wants to be one that isn't even very precise it would really mean transcending gender overall going beyond the categories of gender you know as might happen in heaven right there is no male or female in Christ that would be the transcendence it's funny if you look in CS Lewis I forget which book of his it is and it might be a miracles he uses the word transsexual to refer to how in heaven we don't we're not lusty and we don't have sexuality as much that's not how they use it they use it in because we don't want to say a man who thinks he's a woman or a woman who thinks she's a man or someone suffering from a psychological condition that makes them confused about their biological sex you're just transgender is much easier voll neural what is vulnerable mean we're all vulnerable we're all gonna die no one here gets out of live but what vulnerable is used to do is take slice people up into little demographics and demagogue on them and use them as political fodder to achieve political goals how about science base or evidence-based these two are totally demagogic political words of course things are science-based it's used by the left to say that anyone who doesn't go along with their crazy plans to disrupt the economy or to add more government spending or add more to the federal deficit they're ignoring science they seem to forget that you can't derive an ought from an is you can't derive ideas about what we should do from things that are but they try to lied over that and so they'll say well this is science-based the science tells me we have to raise taxes on everybody and spend a lot of money that's the science I know it's not my political point of view or my ideology so those two is whether they're used to mean the opposite of what they really do how about entitlement what's an entitlement well one entitlements are bad because you know it leads to much more economic or rather a much more federal growth the entire deficit nation that is driven by these entitlement programs Medicare Medicaid and Social Security but also one isn't entitled to anything it what it really means is welfare what it really means is a handout it means going on the dole but entitlement that's the way that we polish it or diversity diversity is probably the most abused one diversity should mean different differences right but the way it's used on campuses here we say we have diversity and that's why we need to ban anyone from speaking who thinks anything a contrary to what we think in the university orthodoxy or diversity means race discrimination so using the university example you might say we need more diversity and that's why we need to discriminate against Asian applicants to universities because we need diversity you know that's how we get diversity it's in it never remains diversity of thought usually what it means is homogeneity so apparently the CDC was told to replace you know science based for example in these documents with quote the CDC bases its recommendations on science in consideration with community standards and wishes good that is more precise because science based is so vague science based is a euphemism what we really mean by science based especially what the left means is there is the aspect of our thought which is scientific and then we are reading that through our ideological lens with our values and our community guidelines or whatever but science isn't the be-all and end-all because policy doesn't come from science we can't just have technocrats telling us what to do because men aren't machines there's a value in the world there's moral weight there's moral value and so we can use science in the scientific method as much as it's useful for and it's very useful but it isn't sufficient because there's another component to the world there's more between heaven and earth that's dreamed of in our philosophy there's a there's a metaphysical component to the world too and we have to take that into consideration because government because politics is the relation of people to one another and government is how we rule ourselves now this directive is very limited but it should expand this is the essential Trump project he shatters these gooey awful euphemisms and empty language which is what political correctness is to get to the heart of the matter in his own fairy Trumpy cough FA way watch him expertly take on the euphemism army you mean it's not politically correct and yet everybody is is it I say you know what give me a different time give me a different time what else would you like to say you want me to say that okay I'll use the word anchor baby excuse me I'll use the word anchor baby it's brilliant this was by the way one of the moments in the campaign where I started to think that Donald Trump maybe wasn't just a complete lunatic ignoramus but maybe he knows what he's doing because what he's saying there's anchor baby that's it paints a picture we know what we meet we're talking about children who were born in the United States as a pathway to citizenship for themselves and their families and it's very hard to hear what that reporter is saying but it's something to the effect of well you should call them future undocumented American citizens without the blah-blah-blah-blah-blah securing the whole thing and Trump says yeah you know what I'm gonna stick with anchor baby I'm gonna stick with the clear language because that's how I'm going to convince people about these issues I can't convince them on your terms on your crazy abusive language I'm gonna use reality you terms the better correspond with reality and that's gonna break your stranglehold on thought in politics George Carlin the late comedian talked about this himself here is we're using that soft language that language that takes the life out of life and it is a function of time it does keep getting worse get another example sometime during my life sometime during my lifetime paper became bathroom tissue sneakers became running shoes false teeth became dental appliances medicine became medication information became directory assistance the dumped became the landfill car crashes became automobile accidents partly cloudy became partly sunny motels became motor lodges house trailers became mobile homes used cars became previously owned transportation room service became guest room dining and constipation became occasional irregularity by the way this is like decades ago that he's talking about this it's gotten so much worse since then but it's that soft language it takes the life out of the words it takes what's convincing out of the words so that the people who are using this deceptive language they so that they can deceive us euphemisms are insidious you know people often say oh it's just semantics you're or you're just arguing over semantics and of course these people don't know what semantics means semantics means meaning it's the study of meaning it's how signs and words and symbols relate to one another and to reality this is why they're euphemisms are so insidious they just proceed by subtly deceiving us by painting at just a little bit off an untrue picture of reality at Christopher Hitchens wrote for the sake of argument then one must never let a euphemism or a false consolation pass uncontested the truth seldom lies but when it does lie it lies somewhere in between it lies it's oh it's just a little off it's a little we're just gonna push you slightly a little bit off the mark until we see a vision of reality that bears no relation to the truth Winston Churchill mockingly admit it a quote perhaps we have been guilty of some terminological inexactitude he's really saying as we lied we lied to you but he's mocking even that accountant concept in that phrase terminological inexactitude have you heard that if some lefty went on television and said terminological inexactitude you guys would glaze over and they would get away with the deception but really it's a lies that PC and euphemisms like this are lies language is the medium of our consciousness it's how we view the world that's why the left is so insistent on political correctness on everybody using their terms and looking at the world on their terms this is why they're so insistent over these pronouns virtually nobody in the country suffers from psychological gender confusion there are like five of these people there not a lot of these people they're suffering and we can be compassionate to them but the left has invested countless funds countless hours energy into a national campaign to make everyone refer to men as she and women as e we have why are we talking about this all the time doesn't that strike you as a little odd if this campaign of language we're really about the vanishingly small minority of people clinically confused about their biological sex wouldn't it be a smaller conversation but of course not it's part of a larger project of language to get us to buy their premises their relativistic premises their debased and barbaric view of politics where we're just different competing interest groups that have no relation to the truth rather than civilized people who look at the world in different ways and debate it and try to get to reality the truth is arrogant they try to use reason to get to that truth here are some other examples this is unbelievable we no longer have criminals according to Obama's Department of Justice we have justice involved youth justice involved youth is the terminology that Obama's DOJ started using to refer to criminal kids justice and but now ironically their injustice involved right they're committing injustice as they're committing crime but justice involved we can't even say that they their offenders they're not offenders they're just involved you know I'm involved in justice right pay my taxes so we have a criminal justice system I give my legitimacy to a government I admit to its credibility that would be involved in justice these kids are criminals but we have we can't say that that's that's that's too mean that gives us the wrong picture we don't have Wars anymore we just have overseas contingency operations whatever it isn't it isn't that so a vivid doesn't really paint a vivid picture the the government forcing you to buy a product from a private company is not a mandate it's not an unprecedented mandate it's a quote individual shared responsibility payment oh go okay in that case take my money here's my check the estate tax is used to refer to what is a death tax what is the death tax when you die you have to pay a tax it's unbelievable what that has been taxed at the corporate level at the income level of the capital gains level they but they've got to get you on the estate there rather on the death tax by calling it the estate tax oh well it's an estate it's no big deal illegal aliens became undocumented workers the most absurd version of this is the dreamers the dreamers these are illegal aliens this is a clear term but no they're just dreamers what do you do you don't like the dreamers you hate dream we want to kill dreams you monster women's health now means killing a baby in the womb that is women's health you know and you you call up your grandmother and you say are you doing gee goes oh well I can still kill babies in the womb so I have that at least I have that I don't think so but that is the euphemism we've even gone past pro-choice which in itself is ridiculous if of course it's a choice the question is what choice is it we have choices or free people the public option or the single-payer system that those are those two euphemisms instead of government control health care we have affirmative action instead of racial discrimination but what is affirmative action it's giving some people privileges based on their race and hurting some people based on their race so I don't think that there's anything terribly affirmative for Asian students who are applying to American universities what that is by their view and by any serious view is racial discrimination but that sounds too icky mmm terror attacks or man-caused disasters get gay marriage was lost on these grounds so the term gay marriage which then became marriage equality even a more outrageous euphemism it presumed a premise so the conservative opposition to gay marriage is not that gay people should be discriminated against or not have certain rights or whatever it's that marriage does not include same-sex unions it's just not what marriage is it would be like it's just a nonsense it's like saying what's the color of seven it doesn't have a logical meaning but and they left knew this so they used the term the minute they use the term it totally shifted the debate it skipped the step of what is marriage what do we think marriage is in 2017 in our culture what does what does it mean for society for individuals for the institution no it became marriage can include same-sex unions and will they have those rights this is where we got to marriage equality because if it's a question of rights and equality they have to win you can't oppose right civil rights and equality and it totally skipped over too dishonestly and disingenuously skipped over the real question which is what is marriage and if we and if marriage can include monogamous same-sex unions for the first time ever why would we exclude polygamous people are polyamorous arrangements from marriage that is just as bigoted by all of that logic now there's raising revenue we always have to raise revenue that's confiscating well through taxation there is giveaway for the wealthy that means allowing people to keep more of their own money that's the giveaway for them when you let them keep what's theirs government spending has become investment doesn't invest in anything just spends but that's investment global cooling became global warming which became the unfold so file climate change that's hard to beat that climate change we noticed that it changes we noticed that there are ups and downs so that's how they they want an argument they're obviously obviously we have the holiday that must not be named you know the holiday you're getting ready for the holiday season to welcome that big holiday man with the big beard and and really refer back to the incarnate birth of the holiday guy yeah that's the the this is what the war on Christmas is about it's a same argument holds for the war on Christmas who cares about the words who cares just semantics right they care there's a reason they care even the word liberal became a liberal we used to be liberals we're liberal now they're not liberal they're completely illiberal they're intolerant of anyone else's views and we should take care to follow presidents trump president drums lead on this and avoid euphemistic language at every turn I know it's tempting I know I was just in New York it's very tempting to try to make the New York Times like us or sophisticated fancy people like cocktail parties like us just say who cares about the pronouns who cares about these silly terms it's just language they can have it if they want it who cares the left cares we should care to the left cares a lot about it we should not cede to them a syllable because euphemistic language gives away whole premises it in turn concedes the culture ultimately it concedes our politics and our government and our Liberty words matter ideas matter reject PC gobbledygook and only use the best words folks come on we have them Lee got the best words let's bring on our panel to discuss we have Alicia crass and Amanda presto Giacomo and all-female panel of deplorable they had an all-day Lee Weyer panel hey the best kind it is the best kind very nice to see you both two aspects on this story Alicia as far as the directive itself is there is there an actual story here is this a news story or were they just getting very excited to knock Trump on something of course they're they're super excited to not Trump on something I mean Ben has said it over and over and over again that being our boss ben shapiro so i'll say something nice about him now because it is the christmas season is that he no christmas christmas season come on michael no war on christmas here stuff with that political correctness it is the christmas season and ben is right so i'll let him have that he's right that the mainstream media often jumps just right to anything that trump says or anything that anyone within the administration does and just blows it up for no reason and sometimes it's hard that if he ever gets to attend to say that everything is a ten when some of the things that he does or maybe a level four or five but that's not it's this just too much for them everything they take and run with that's absolutely right and you know there i guess there's this little directive who who really cares we're talking about budget proposal documents but they got it they're gonna run democracy dies in darkness now speaking of George Carlin Carlin said famously when fascism comes to America it will not be in brown and black shirts it will not be with Jack boots it will be Nike sneakers and smiley shirts smiley smiley and the smiley is the issue this is the issue here Amanda when we refer to men who think they're women or wish very much to be women as as she or rather as he or him rather than she or her we look like jerks is there any way to avoid this well well that's kind of the whole as you deconstructed that's kind of the whole point of them reconstructing language and using euphemisms and and being so adamant that we use these pronouns or whatever the is that task for that day that's why it's so important because then the opposite side like how could you possibly be against you know equality or diversity or we know insert buzzword here that's that's the whole point of the left deconstructing language so when it comes to things like gender and how they're just deconstructing gender it paints the right to be bigots right they hate trans people how dare you not call this grown man and address you know she or whatever so I mean this is all by plan and as you said I think the Conservatives need to really push back on this deal they're gonna call you a big anyways they're going to call you transphobic anyway just say what is truth like you just have to stick to the truth because otherwise they win like we can't kick him see conceding round as we do so often so they're gonna call you names anyway and as we've seen from this past election speak truth but is there is there any way not to look like a jerk I'm worried that we don't look good to a voting public even though we're saying a true thing that a man is a man and a woman as a woman and you can't magically become one by wishing very much Alicia you're much nicer than I am is there any way to like smiley smiley and look good on this I don't know I mean I keep reading disturbing things in the news today about quote-unquote fetuses and what the UK with their national health care socialist you know system is doing and not helping babies born early and I'm gonna call them baby so the Trump administration's decision to change language with the CDC is it's like fine it's fine by me I mean if they want us to call them what they want to be called then maybe they should show us some respect and call babies and your neuro actually babies and not this fetuses and and I just think it's really disturbing I think that the the broader it's on one hand they want to have a hashtag me two women are always victims movement but then on the other hand they want to change the narrative of what the nuclear family is or the roles that men and women play in society and I just every single time I try to look at it every single time I try to think of like the leftist perspective it just doesn't make sense to me and there and I don't know what their long game is here well you you're so right on the fetus bit that is so smart of them they've found a demographic that doesn't vote you know Reagan used to say that he notices everyone who's in favor of abortion has already been born and those those little babies don't have a voice in any of this they they have the least voice of anybody so if you call them by a ridiculous euphemism they won't get angry and vote you out of office but we do we do run that risk and I think you're both right I think we just have to put the truth above all things and if you state the truth in good faith and not trying to just be a jerk about it I think you'll get some credit for it and people might come around but you know there is that Bible it says people hate the truth they're gonna run away from you so I beware of what you're doing caveat emptor okay I've got to say goodbye to Facebook and YouTube we have much more to talk about today we got a lot of great news out there Pope Francis is saying things about fake news and probably damning CNN to hell we've got the dreamers we've got al franken done resigning I know you want to see it we appreciate everybody who already subscribes you help us keep the lights on after my two red eyes in three days I need the cough fa in my cup and you help fill it up if you are not already subscribed go to daily wire.com and you can see the rest of the show it's $10 a month $100 for an annual membership what do you get for it you get me you got Andrew Clavin you get the Ben Shapiro show yeah yeah yeah I know Michael get to the good stuff here it is now you know as well as I do you've been reading the news we might get a tax reform bill when that tax reform bill comes down may God help you you better be ready for this we know not the time or the hour when the tax reform bill will be passed we need that you need that Lapidus tears tumbler otherwise you're gonna drown and all those salty salty tears so go to daily wire.com right now you can have them hot or cold always salty and delicious we'll be right back okay on egregious abuses of language meant to manipulate our heartstrings and deceive us it turns out that legalizing the so-called dreamers the younger illegal aliens would cost payers 26 billion dollars that's according to the Congressional Budget Office reporting Friday that legalizing these 2 million illegal aliens characterized by Obama's dreamers would cost twenty five point nine billion dollars now Alisha Democrats are so generous with other people's money that sounds like a nightmare is there any economic or political argument to give these people legal status to give them amnesty I don't know and I was starting to read the breakdown of it which is why my head was down and my eyes were glazed over when we started that's usually the reaction I get from women apathy impatience it wasn't you it was the numbers and I was trying to break them down and I was trying to understand them they're saying that oh it's over a decade so it's not as big of a deal but you just mentioned that's 2 million dreamers I mean I'm not that good at math but that's way too much money per immigrant that would become you know legalized under this potential plan that of course Democrats are pushing I I think that there is an argument that tug at the heartstrings kind of Marco Rubio Mitt Romney argument that they made of like some of these people are not here at the fault of their own so can we give them a path to citizen citizenship that kind of enables them to be a part of the American Dream and but you know since it wasn't their fault if they were born here or their parents brought him legally across the border on an airplane from Asia you know when they were like 2 years old right and actually the the biggest number of these people I think that are potentially gonna cost us are the people that come here on a travel or a student visa and then just ride it out it isn't these dreamers so that's a separate part of immigration that we have to take care of but I just that is a lot of money to cover two million people and I don't know what argument the Democrats can make that to say well they're gonna end up paying this back to society because that's a lot of responsibility for those two million dreamers to have on their own backs I mean couldn't we send them to like Harvard Law School PhD buy them a house in a car for all that money where they spending all this money oh I thought you were suggesting Ivy League's and I mean everyone ivy-league I can't stand well we certainly shouldn't send them there we I'm all for saying they can stay if they promise to vote Republican but that will not be achieved because there's lots of Republicans as we saw aka Alabama that I'm not okay with I mean I'm all for people staying that are going to contribute to the fundamentals of of you know what our Constitution stands for what the Bill of Rights stands for and gonna you know provide for themselves and for their family and I just this is one of those areas that when you get in the weeds and when you get in the numbers it is kind of hard to have a very clear cut and dry example but the numbers that they're coming up with out of this report are just astonishing and it's way too much I know and you're right on Alabama it was awful when those Republicans stayed home and gave it to Doug Johnson it was awful Amanda you know Nana there has long been a pro-immigration strain in the GOP that's what Alicia's talking about that Mitt Romney thing it's even in the conservative movement though I mean there are plenty of good arguments for immigration in particularly from immigration from Latin America they work hard and they go to church so maybe we should adjust to them you know you should take a page or two out of their book but is that now finished is that open borders you know come in and all that really matters is GDP and who cares what happens to political institutions if we don't bring these people over and Americanize them quickly enough is that over and if so what killed it I think this past election shows that Pete and this is a cross I would say political parties as well people want a secure sovereign nation they don't want people flowing through this country we saw that I mean Donald Trump's number one platform was immigration and it wasn't just illegal immigration it was that too but people want a strong sovereign country and you know I just I don't see how these dreamers or chain migration or any of these things are wins for the left I mean their whole goal of course is to bring over these these dreamers or these illegals and give amnesty because then they will vote a certain way and that 80 percent for democrat yeah 100% so that's their incentive but the American people don't want that like I said we saw that in the election so I don't see how it's especially with these dreamers I don't understand how we're just gonna I just I don't think this makes any political sense so they're gonna contribute I think it was estimated in 900 million dollars but you know both are gonna cost us 20 26 or 29 billion dollars and that's just them right we have like I think it's estimated 12 million illegals in the country now and then with chain migration if we don't get that clamp down on they're gonna bring those two million dreamers are gonna bring over 800,000 other family members so this just compounds in compounds we're already in massive debt I just don't see how this is politically viable and I think the election showed that so we need to actually focus on the border focus on the illegals already half here and then dreamers should be like last and we can maybe you know use that as you know as a collateral to get what we want on the right but I just I don't see how it's a politically advantageous thing to do for the Republicans well it's funny because well Barack Obama and the left and Democrats were advocating spending twenty six billion dollars presumably giving these particular illegal aliens gold-plated Lamborghinis he ended Barack Obama ended the wet foot dry foot policy that allowed Cubans who were fleeing Cuban slavery to have legal status in America and it is I can't help but notice that one of those immigrants vote for Democrats and those Cubans are pretty reliably Republican what a coincidence huh he was even attacked by some immigration activists right here in California in Los Angeles he had protesters standing up during speeches and up in the Bay Area as well he had Asian protesters immigrant protesters stand up certain during some of his speeches because it was kind of the do as I say not as I do it was one of those campaign promises that he had made about similar to I'm gonna close down Gitmo he had made promises to immigrants and to dreamers and toward the end of his second term his own base started to get frustrated with him when they realized he wasn't gonna keep those promises that he had made yeah it's very hard and and get most still open that's okay not so bad having a four lefty president is sometimes okay if he's also incompetent Pope Francis came out swinging against fake news on Saturday he said presumably an Italian in his very nice Pope Francis way we must not fall prey to the sins of communication disinformation that is giving just one side of the argument slander which is sensationalistic or defamation looking for outdated and old things and bringing them to light today interesting in the wake of me to Amanda has the Holy Father just condemned CNN to hell it looks like it I mean he's putting his foot down on fake news and and the number one people disseminating fake news happens to be CNN in Washington Post not far behind but CNN is the main purveyor yeah yeah definitely I mean I know I know Pope Francis leans left on some things I mean not unlike Church doctoring but but like just like climate change and things like that but but this did seem like a slap in the face to the the mainstream media so it's very welcome actually it's a good sorry go ahead I think Pope Francis was victims of fake news himself so I think he's a little he might be to the left I don't think anyone would deny that but if you compare the number of things he has said with the number of things that the mainstream media say that he has said they're very different lists now so what do you make of the Pope's argument is he essentially because it cuts both ways it hits CNN but it also hits those of us who have points of views as well is he essentially saying that public relations is inherently sinful that communications for a campaign or a company you should have thought that like reading hits to his detailed statement and I was like oh snap like I guess depending on what side of the aisle you are your candidate is screwed in the Pope thinks that you're spewing disinformation or trying to make things look better than they are but I think to actually journalists as a whole there's probably I can count on one hand the journalist that I actually respect one of them would be Amy Parnes who wrote that book about the fallout of Hillary Clinton's campaign and how from the inside she saw it all going to threads to shreds and part of the reason I trust her is that she does not talk about her political she's not even registered to vote and so reading the Pope's quote I think you could potentially construe it as a word commentary politics and he's kind of pooh-poohing on us but then who could also read it as an encouragement to true journalists to go out and do their journalistic duty which is to get to the truth which is to get to the bottom line and to not offer their political opinion or their side - it should truly be to steal a Fox News of grace fair and balanced but I think it could apply to you know the Fox News is of the world and also the cnn's of the world here and we're very we always drink also is that you're like favorite is this your favorite news story of the week it's like your Pope and fake news like in the things it really is like a Christmas present what made me feel very good because obviously I always try to order this show to be very balanced give both sides equal weight because that's what we do here we I will say there are at least more serious journalists at the panel of deplorable z than CNN or the New York Times or The Washington Post so maybe that'll get me just like two thousand years in purgatory instead of you know going straight to hell cigars like what is the Catholic Church well the body is a temple in the temple needs incense GH estrogen southern Catholic Church is a thick steak it's like a thick steak a glass of red wine and a good cigar and I believe him and you know even if the Pope doesn't watch the Michael Nolt show perhaps he does but even if he doesn't you know the Pope is only infallible when he is infallible that's not all the time so who knows if he's speaking ex cathedra I don't think so let's move on to senators who are now calling on Al Franken not to resign that's so funny who could have predicted this Oh me Joe Manchin Pat Leahy both think he should not have resigned Manchin said what they did to Nell was atrocious the Democrats they groped him during photo ops no that's not what he said said I hope they have enough guts and enough conscience and enough heart to say al we made a mistake asking you prematurely to leave you're good enough you're smart enough and gosh darn er people like you he presumably added later pat leahy added I think we acted prematurely before we had all the facts amber Phillips writes today in Washington Post could Al Franken unreason sure of course he could because he hasn't resigned yet I knew it I told you when it happened I knew it when I heard this clip today I am announcing that in the coming weeks I will be resigning as a member of the United States Senate you know I I am announcing to you at some point something will change at some point I brave bold stay some point Ben Shapiro is gonna finally fire you who's that yeah that's like a hundred percent drew the question is when you know Alicia was the fix in this whole time was this always a fake resignation mix was in I think and I think that it had all had to do with Alabama that they wanted to set it up as they were holier-than-thou they were the righteous people they're the ones who stand for women and all that jazz that they like to stout all the time but now that their guy won in Alabama they're gonna be like dang it the the GOP the voters in Alabama didn't fall for our racist southern bigoted you know Pro child molester vote thing and so now we have to make sure that we can maintain this vote in the Senate and keep good a while in here I'm really disappointed I mean I know that mansion has addy after his name but on some things he votes pretty you know more independently than the Democratic Party he could be doing it to save his own seat but I'm really disappointed in him for this I thought that he was potentially a better human being than that well you know Andrew Klavan does describe these guys accurately as the four city politicians right this is the all-star league of politicians and so joe Manchin's good on gun control why is he good on gun control cuz he's from West Virginia if he lived in New York he might have a different position I'd be more schumer like yeah right they're very good at being politicians and that's what you're seeing here from Joe Manchin I I mean he's better than Nancy Pelosi certainly but then again Nancy Pelosi doesn't live in West Virginia Amanda what should Republicans be hoping for here with Al Franken should we be encouraging him to resign and setting this precedent that if anyone accuses you years later of getting a little handsy with no real possible evidence that you can just resign obviously there was that photo of him getting weird at the USO tour but a lot of these allegations are totally unverifiable they're saying well he slipped a hand and was never on camera and yada yada yada should we be hoping for that or do we want Franken to stay so that we can hang it around Democrats necks well not not to hang around their necks but I don't I don't think you should go because I don't think like you said none of these allegations were fully proven I know there was that picture but if I mean if you look at the well I'm not I'm not going to sit here and defend al franken like that picture was grow she was sleeping I'm not gonna defend that but a lot of these other allegations were not you know he denied them and they weren't proved I mean that so again like we have to be really careful to just take an accusation and then you know ruin someone's life or ruin someone's career like I said before we've seen this on college campuses and it's really really bad stuff so let's think of due process and not just like you know crush anyone who has an allegation especially when it's a you know 20 or 40 years ago like we saw before and then also one another point is that so I think without Franken they were they were just you know having him hang on there and then we're gonna see like as you said Michael that they were gonna if for more one you know they could probably find a way to get him back in there but but also I think it's they're realizing it's taking him so long that the act that this whole thing was set up to go after Trump like they re bringing up these meet these allegations against President Trump that we all heard during the election he this is already been litigated this is already been lit again like they had megyn kelly last week you know trying to relitigate this she had all these accusers on nobody cared nobody watched we already knew this yeah and I mean more information about Lisa bloom that attorney and she apparently was procuring money for women who were coming forward and saying that President Trump accused most sexual assault we start to harassment that's troublesome we already knew it but there it isn't in a report from the hill and that's the hill that's not from you know some right-wing site how much is she offering not because you know the blank book money is kind of running out and to say a lot of things I have the best folks no you're you're absolutely right there is this mania there is this hysteria that's going on where if someone's career and life can be ruined because someone said something happened 40 years ago clearly we've reached a point beyond justice we've reached a point beyond due process but there's another consideration for why we should keep Franken which is that it's totally cost-free for Democrats to bump him it actually helps them because there's a Democrat governor of Minnesota a Democrat will likely replace him even at the next election so it doesn't really matter where as Al Franken House damaged goods keep him in there that is absolutely fine I'm not gonna let Democrats get a free pass when it doesn't matter give me Bob Menendez then we'll talk
