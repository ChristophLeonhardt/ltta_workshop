here's one thing we know about some of Donald Trump's closest advisors they have mixed business politics and crime to create great wealth and greater risk so you can't grasp this era without understanding those forces and how a Hustler's mindset applies to the laws of power so tonight we turn to an expert in the game Grammy award-winning hip-hop artist and businessman 50 cent who's rapped that friends can call him by his government name Curtis Jackson he sold over 30 million albums working with artists like Eminem dr. Dre his hit into club was number one on Billboard's Hot 100 for over two months it made Rolling Stones list of the greatest songs of all time across all genres he is a producer and an actor in the hit Starz show power he's also starring in the movie den of thieves with Gerard Butler Jackson grew up in Queens surviving a nine-shot gun attack and took on the music industry itself with early controversial songs like ghetto Quran and how to rob a fearlessness that clearly paid off which he explores in the 50th law book he co-wrote with Robert Greene it all made him rich and he's established deals and recording book publishing energy drinks a champagne that retails for over three hundred dollars and Jackson made an estimated 50 million dollars or more when his vitaminwater steak was sold to coke in 2007 Forbes has named him one of the top 5 wealthiest artists in hip-hop 50 cent so excited to have you here I'm a happy PR you know business you know politics you know power and you know Donald Trump a little bit you even had him on your g-unit radio show in 2005 let's look at that well you know I have some kids and myself included but I have kids they think you are the best the absolute best that's pretty cool I'll tell you my little daughter Ivanka and my son Eric these people they just love your they love your music Wow you're gonna keep making it you better keep making a lot of laughs back then what's changed Wow I mean a lot of change you know I didn't know the he said the view that he kind of show people over the period that he's been I did learn from his behaviour that they have personalized things personalized he will take it personal mm-hmm I mean I'm thinking about that book I mentioned by Robert Greene and he describes you in it he says 50 Cent's lack of fear is displayed by his attitude and his actions he lived through too many dangerous encounters to be remotely fazed by anything in the corporate world right and he wrote that you'd walk away and not care and I want to ask you about that because that really overlaps with some of your analysis about Donald Trump being an accidental president and not fearing anything when he was a candidate take a look his presidency is accident if you were president by accident you might do some of the things Donald Trump is doing yeah I think he was doing that to build his profile for a bigger deal on television and everything else how did you come to that view because a lot of people agree with that and that's kind of scary if that's the reason he became president yeah I think it was a surprise to him when he actually won you know because he said things that were really graphic in the campaign just generally people were into the idea of someone who was non politician now people know you for your art and I think for your business they may not know that like the rest of us you've been following the news in the Trump era I want to show a little bit of something people may not have seen that you posted to your followers on on the internet right when if when the news first broke the Michael Cohen Trump's lawyers home an office was raided you had no doubt what was gonna happen next let's take a look at this you were proven right because he did flip why is it that you you were so sure he would flip well I know the federal guidelines that is saying to my wig are okay Michael was is a still straight-laced guy still an attorney I can't do that kind of pressure can't bear the pressure you mentioned the federal guidelines that's something people talk about in the street it's something lawyers talk about a lot of people may not know this so I'm gonna quote 50 to 50 if that's okay in one of your older songs I'm a hustler you said when the feds come in the game loyalty is limited with the feds you do 85 percent of your time Duke you get 10 you'll damn near do 9 and this is from the federal guidelines themselves that you're quoting all federal prisoners must spend a minimum of 85 percent of their sentences behind bars before becoming eligible for release it doesn't sound like I'm telling the truth because I'm using the slang in fact tell them more than they need to know you know it definitely definitely not over I want to ask you about guns because you know this is very controversial let's start again with your lyrics from high all the time which is an interesting song you say look you don't want me to be your kids role model I'll teach them how to buck them 380s and load up them hollows in power of the dollar another classic you said look parents warned their kids about people like me and you have that persona but anyone watching this now sees you here as a very professional successful businessman at this point in your life but you still post online a lot you say get the strap right talking about these guns do you ever worry that that the kids who look up to you so much might get the wrong impression about that do you think you're supporting gun use I think people are smart enough to understand the things that you say versus the things that you do it to two different things mm-hmm you know they understand the difference between entertainment and the reality of your lifestyle or what you live what your dog has you wouldn't be able to be as successful as I've been to this point if I was living exactly the way the lyrics so when you say get the strap does that mean go get a gun and kill someone well actually when I when I originally started using the catchphrase it was like whenever I seen something shocking I would say good dish rattling what are you doing this happens there's nothing else because there's when there's a point of confusion and the environment that I grew up in there's there's points where there's nothing left to do but get this rap a couple other lines I want to ask you about this is one of yours you said here's the jewel love your enemies and hate your friends the enemies remain the same friends always change what does that mean that means you know like that when a person becomes the enemy or is this this in order to believe someone that you have differences with they stay in the same position you keep your distance from watch oh and it's they designed the friends the people to allow closer to you they have the ability to to have the the seeds that don't require water to grow mm-hmm of entitlement so you may do some things for them but it may never be enough another lyric from one of your softer songs 21 questions which is a great karaoke song cuz it's got a slow beat if I went back to a hoopty from a Benz would you poof and disappear like some of my friends what does that mean would you disappear fell off of a set peg which would you disappear like some of my friends so if you stay on top how do you how do you ever know who those people are time I'll show you you know some of these people have expiration dates they spoil like no you know I'm a big fan very saying I appreciate you coming on the beat I love seeing you every time just you start talking I see you won't flip to the news and stuff we stop immediately because we know something's coming we said this cooler than usual well thank you very much that means a lot hey I'm already Melbourne from MSNBC you can see more of our videos right here or better yet subscribe to our You Tube channel below you could have been anywhere in the
