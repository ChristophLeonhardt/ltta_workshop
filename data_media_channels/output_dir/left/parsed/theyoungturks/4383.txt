DONALD TRUMP HAS DECLARED
THAT TRANSGENDER INDIVIDUALS
WILL NOT BE ALLOWED TO JOIN THE
MILITARY.
HE ADVISED EVERYONE
ABOUT THIS THROUGH TWITTER,
WHICH IS HIS FAVORITE FORM OF
COMMUNICATING WITH THE AMERICAN
PEOPLE, AND IT WAS A SERIES OF
TWEETS, LET ME GO AHEAD AND READ
THEM TO YOU.
HE SAID --
>>OKAY.
THERE IS NO TREMENDOUS
MEDICAL COSTS, IN FACT THERE
HAVE BEEN STUDIES THAT LOOK INTO
THIS, ONE OF THOSE STUDIES WAS
RELEASED IN MAY 2016 BY THE RAND
CORPORATION, IN FACT THE
PENTAGON COMMISSIONED THAT
STUDY, AND WHAT THEY FOUND, I
THINK THIS IS RELEVANT TO THE
DISCUSSION, WAS THAT LETTING
TRANSGENDER PEOPLE SERVE OPENLY
WOULD HAVE A MINIMAL IMPACT ON
READINESS AND HEALTHCARE COSTS,
LARGELY BECAUSE THERE ARE SO FEW
IN THE MILITARY.
THERE ARE 1.3
MILLION MEMBERS OF THE MILITARY,
AND THE TRANSGENDER COMPONENT IS
ABOUT 1300 TO 6000 INDIVIDUALS.
IT'S HARD TO HAVE EXACT NUMBERS
BECAUSE IT'S BASED ON SELF
REPORTING AND THINGS LIKE THAT,
BUT IT WOULD NOT BE A HUGE COST
BURDEN AT ALL.
I THINK THIS IS
JUST A WAY TO DISTRACT FROM ALL
THE NEGATIVE PRESS HE'S BEEN
GETTING IN REGARD TO RUSSIA
AND THAT INVESTIGATION.
>>OF COURSE.
>>HE'S SUCH A CLOWN.
>>LET ME DIVE FURTHER INTO THE
FACTS.
OF THE PEOPLE WHO NEED
ANY KIND OF HEALTHCARE RELATED
EXPENSES, WHETHER IT'S HORMONE
TREATMENT OR OTHERWISE, IN THE
MILITARY IN ANY GIVEN YEAR, IT
WOULD RANGE FROM A WHOPPING 25
PEOPLE TO ALL THE WAY TO 140
PEOPLE, IN A FORCE OF, AS ANA
POINTED OUT, 1.3 MILLION PEOPLE.
THE RAND STUDY WAS MORE
SPECIFIC, AND AT RAND
CORPORATION NOBODY IS LIBERAL --
THE PENTAGON SAYS RAND, GIVE US
A STUDY, THEY CRUNCH THE
NUMBERS, AND THEY SAID THAT THE
AMOUNT THAT WOULD GO TO DEALING
WITH TRANSGENDER HEALTHCARE
COSTS WOULD BE, QUOTE, AN
EXCEEDINGLY SMALL
PROPORTION OF TOTAL HEALTH
EXPENDITURES.
>>YOU WANT TO HAVE A
CONVERSATION ABOUT WASTING MONEY
IN THE MILITARY, WE JUST DID A
STORY THIS WEEK ABOUT HOW THE
PENTAGON WASTED $28 MILLION ON
PROVIDING UNIFORMS TO AFGHAN
SOLDIERS THAT WERE ONLY MEANT TO
BE USED IN A FOREST SETTING.
THEY DON'T FIGHT IN THE FOREST,
THEY FIGHT IN THE DESERT.
SO
THEY WERE COMPLETELY USELESS
UNIFORMS.
AND THERE IS NEVER ANY
CONVERSATION ABOUT THAT $28
MILLION THAT WAS WASTED, AND BY
THE WAY I KNOW THAT IS A DROP IN
THE BUCKET CONSIDERING HOW MUCH
MONEY WE FUNNEL TO THE DEFENSE
DEPARTMENT, BUT IT'S JUST ONE
EXAMPLE OF HOW MUCH WASTE THERE
IS IN THE MILITARY, AND YOU HAVE
THE AUDACITY TO TALK ABOUT THE
COUPLE THOUSAND TRANSGENDER
PEOPLE WE HAVE WHO ARE RISKING
THEIR LIVES TO FIGHT FOR THIS
COUNTRY, WE CAN'T TAKE CARE OF
THEM?
TOO EXPENSIVE?
>>ONLY 2% OF AFGHANISTAN IS
FOREST, IT WAS A PREPOSTEROUS
DECISION AND SINCE 2007 HAS COST
US $71 MILLION, THROWN IN THE
GARBAGE.
BUT WAY LESS THAN THAT
FOR TRANSGENDER PEOPLE, WE CAN'T
HAVE IT.
THINK ABOUT WHAT ANA
JUST TOLD YOU, LET THAT SINK IN.
THEY ARE READY TO DIE FOR THIS
COUNTRY, THEY SIGNED UP, THEY
MIGHT HAVE THEIR ARMS AND LEGS
BLOWN OFF IN PLACES LIKE IRAQ
AND AFGHANISTAN, AND THAT HAS
HAPPENED TO A LOT OF FOLKS THAT
HAVE SERVED, THERE ARE MEMBERS
OF NAVY SEAL SIX WHO ARE
TRANSGENDER, YOU WANT TO TELL
THEM THEY ARE NOT PATRIOTIC
ENOUGH?
YOU DON'T WANT THEM IN
THE ARMED FORCES?
BUT DONALD
TRUMP, YOU NEVER SIGNED UP AND
YOU HAD EVERY CHANCE IN THE
WORLD.
VIETNAM WAS HAPPENING
WHEN YOU WERE OF AGE, YOU GOT
FIVE DEFERMENTS, NOW YOU TELL
TRANS PEOPLE THEY CAN'T SERVE?
THEY CAN'T RISK THEIR LIVES FOR
THEIR COUNTRY?
HE PRETENDED HE
HAD BONE SPURS IN HIS FOOT, IT
WAS SUCH A BAD LIFE THAT WHEN
ASKED DURING CAMPAIGNING WHICH
WHAT IT WAS IN, HE WAS LIKE, I
DON'T REMEMBER.
I SEE IT WAS A
DEVASTATING INJURY.
NOW TO SCORE
CHEAP POLITICAL TRICKS YOU WILL
GO AFTER PATRIOTIC AMERICANS
LOOKING TO DEFEND ALL OF OUR
FREEDOMS?
THEY SIGN UP TO DEFEND
OUR FREEDOMS, AND YOU STRIP
THEIR FREEDOMS AWAY.
THIS ISSUE
IS ABOUT MORE THAN JUST TRANS
PEOPLE, THE EFFECT IT HAS ON THE
LGBT COMMUNITY IS IMPORTANT, I
DON'T WANT TO MINIMIZE IT, BUT
IT'S ABOUT ALL OF US.
IT'S ABOUT
SAYING NO, WE DON'T BELIEVE
FREEDOM APPLIES TO EVERYONE, WE
DON'T BELIEVE WE SHOULD BE
EQUAL.
SO SOME PEOPLE IN THIS
COUNTRY SAY THERE ARE CERTAIN
PEOPLE, THAT USED TO BE BASED ON
RACE, STILL IS FOR SOME FOLKS,
NOW WE ARE SWITCHING IT TO
SEXUAL IDENTITY, TO RELIGION.
IF
YOU ARE A CERTAIN RELIGION OR
SEXUAL PREFERENCE YOU ARE NOT
EQUAL.
YOU HAVE LESS RIGHTS THAN
US, YOU ARE LESS AMERICAN.
NO, I
THINK THEY ARE WAY MORE AMERICAN
THAN YOU BECAUSE WE UNDERSTAND
THE PRINCIPLES OF THIS COUNTRY.
SO TRUMP AND THE PEOPLE WHO
APPLAUD THIS DECISION ARE
GROTESQUE AND HAVE NO IDEA WHAT
IT MEANS TO BE AMERICAN.
>>TO GIVE YOU MORE CONTEXT,
DURING THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION
THE DON'T ASK, DON'T TELL POLICY
WAS FIRMLY IN PLACE UNTIL OBAMA
DID SOMETHING ABOUT IT.
THAT
WOULD ALLOW MEMBERS OF THE LGBT
COMMUNITY, NOT JUST TRANS
INDIVIDUALS, BUT ANYONE IN THAT
COMMUNITY, TO JOIN THE MILITARY
AND NOT WORRY ABOUT BEING
DISCRIMINATED AGAINST.
A
COMPONENT OF OBAMA'S DIRECTIVE
WOULD ALLOW TRANSGENDER MILITARY
MEMBERS TO JOIN WITHOUT FEAR OF
DISCRIMINATION JULY 1.
JAMES
MATTIS GETS INVOLVED, THIS IS
DURING THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION,
AND DECIDES TO POSTPONE THAT
JULY 1 DECISION, WHAT WAS
SUPPOSED TO GO INTO EFFECT JULY
1, AND THEN ALL OF A SUDDEN WE
GET THESE TWEETS FROM TRUMP.
I
FIND IT ALL SUPER INTERESTING
CONSIDERING THE FACT THAT WHEN
TRUMP WAS RUNNING, HE CLAIMED
THAT HE WAS VERY PRO-LGBT.
HE
WAS SO MUCH MORE PRO-LGBT
THAN HILLARY CLINTON.
IF YOU DON'T BELIEVE ME, HERE IS
WHAT HE HAD TO SAY ABOUT THAT.
>>I REFUSE TO ALLOW AMERICA TO
BECOME A PLACE WHERE GAY PEOPLE,
CHRISTIAN PEOPLE, JEWISH PEOPLE,
ARE TARGETS OF PERSECUTION AND
INTIMIDATION BY RADICAL ISLAMIC
PREACHERS OF HATE AND VIOLENCE.
REMEMBER THIS -- RADICAL ISLAM
IS ANTI-WOMAN, ANTI-GAY, AND
ANTI-AMERICAN.
IF WE WANT TO
PROTECT THE QUALITY OF LIFE FOR
ALL AMERICANS, WOMEN AND
CHILDREN, GAY AND STRAIGHT, JEWS
AND CHRISTIANS, AND ALL PEOPLE,
THEN WE NEED TO TELL THE TRUTH
ABOUT RADICAL ISLAM, AND WE NEED
TO DO IT NOW.
IT'S A STRIKE AT
THE HEART AND SOUL OF WHO WE ARE
AS A NATION.
IT'S AN ASSAULT ON
THE ABILITY OF FREE PEOPLE TO
LIVE THEIR LIVES, LOVE WHO THEY
WANT, AND EXPRESS THEIR
IDENTITY.
IT'S AN ATTACK ON THE
RIGHT OF EVERY SINGLE AMERICAN
TO LIVE IN PEACE AND SAFETY IN
THEIR OWN COUNTRY.
HILLARY
CLINTON CAN NEVER CLAIM TO BE A
FRIEND OF THE GAY COMMUNITY AS
LONG AS SHE CONTINUES TO SUPPORT
IMMIGRATION POLICIES THAT BRING
ISLAMIC EXTREMISTS TO OUR
COUNTRY, AND WHO SUPPRESS WOMEN,
GAYS, AND ANYONE ELSE WHO
DOESN'T SHARE THEIR VIEWS OR
VALUES.
AND BY THE WAY THE LGBT
COMMUNITY, WHAT HAS HAPPENED TO
THEM IS SO SAD, AND TO BE
THINKING ABOUT WHERE THEIR
POLICIES ARE CURRENTLY WITH THIS
ADMINISTRATION IS A DISGRACE TO
THAT COMMUNITY, I WILL TELL YOU
RIGHT NOW.
SHE CAN'T HAVE IT
BOTH WAYS, SHE CAN'T CLAIM TO BE
SUPPORTIVE OF THESE COMMUNITIES
WHILE TRYING TO INCREASE THE
NUMBER OF PEOPLE COMING IN WHO
WANT TO OPPRESS THE SAME
COMMUNITIES.
ASK YOURSELF WHO IS
REALLY THE FRIEND OF WOMEN AND
THE LGBT COMMUNITY.
DONALD FROM
WITH ACTIONS, OR HILLARY CLINTON
WITH HER WORDS?
I WILL TELL YOU
THE BETTER FRIEND IS, AND
SOMEDAY I BELIEVE THAT WILL BE
PROVEN OUT BIG LEAGUE.
>>WHO NEEDS RADICAL ISLAMIC
EXTREMISTS WHEN YOU HAVE SOMEONE
LIKE DONALD TRUMP, WHO DOES
EXACTLY WHAT HE JUST CRITICIZED
RADICAL ISLAMIC EXTREMISTS FOR
DOING?
VIOLATING THE RIGHTS OF
WOMEN, VIOLATING THE RIGHTS OF
THE "LBGT" COMMUNITY, HE CAN'T
EVEN GET IT --
>>HE CAN'T EVEN GET IT RIGHT,
HE'S READING FROM A PROMPTER AND
HE STILL SAYS YOU WILL FIND OUT
WHO IS A TRUE FRIEND OF THE BLT
COMMUNITY.
BIGLY.
WE FOUND OUT
TODAY.
HE'S PRETENDING TO BE ON
THE LGBT COMMUNITY'S SIDE SO HE
CAN AND LIST THEM ON HATING
MUSLIM PEOPLE.
HE IS LIKE, LET'S
HATE THESE GUYS ONE AT A TIME.
AND YOU THINK HE'S NOT GOING TO
TURN ON YOU?
CREDIT TO THE
LEADERS IN THAT COMMUNITY, THEY
DIDN'T BELIEVE HIM FOR A SECOND.
BACK THEN THE PRESIDENT OF THE
HUMAN RIGHTS CAMPAIGN SAID LGBT
Q PEOPLE, WE ARE MUSLIMS, WE ARE
WOMEN, WE ARE LATINO, WE ARE AS
DIVERSE AS THE FABRIC OF THIS
NATION AND ANY ATTACK ON ONE OF
US IS AN ATTACK ON ALL OF US.
GOD BLESS HIM FOR SAYING THE
RIGHT THING BACK THEN, AND
OBVIOUSLY THE LGBT COMMUNITY
ALONG WITH ALL OF US ARE
OUTRAGED AT THE LATEST ACTIONS
OF DONALD TRUMP TO DISCRIMINATE
AGAINST THAT COMMUNITY AS HE WAS
LOOKING FORWARD TO DISCRIMINATE
AGAINST THE MUSLIMS EARLIER IN
THAT STATEMENT.
AND BY THE WAY,
COME ON, EVEN IF YOU ARE A
DONALD TRUMP SUPPORTER, YOU KNOW
HE IS A PATHOLOGICAL LIAR.
DID
YOU REALLY BELIEVE HIM WHEN HE
SAID HE WOULD BE A BIGGER FRIEND
TO THE GAY COMMUNITY THAN
HILLARY CLINTON AND THE
DEMOCRATS?
DIDN'T BELIEVE HIM,
YOU KNOW HE WAS LYING THROUGH
HIS TEETH, BECAUSE YOU ARE
CELEBRATING SOME OF HIS
ACTIONS TODAY.
>>AND THEY DIDN'T EVEN CARE THAT
HE WAS LYING, BECAUSE THAT'S
SOMETHING THE RIGHT WING WANTS.
THEY LIKE TO DIFFERENTIATE
THEMSELVES FROM OTHER
FUNDAMENTALISTS, BUT HOW ARE YOU
DIFFERENT IF YOU ARE FIGHTING
TOOTH AND NAIL TO TAKE AWAY
REPRODUCTIVE RIGHTS FOR WOMEN,
FIGHTING TOOTH AND NAIL TO DO
AWAY WITH THE PROTESTING RIGHTS
OF AMERICANS THAT DISAGREE WITH
YOU, FIGHTING TO AND MAIL TO DO
AWAY WITH ANY TYPE OF PROGRESS
WE'VE HAD FOR THE LGBT
COMMUNITY?
THEY THINK THEY ARE
SO MUCH BETTER AND SO MUCH MORE
SELF-RIGHTEOUS -- IT'S ALL B.S.
AND IT'S SO INCREDIBLY
DISHEARTENING AND SAD TO SEE
THAT HE WILL GO TO THIS EXTREME
JUST TO DISTRACT EVERYONE FROM
THE FACT THAT HE IS A CLOWN,
THAT HE'S FACING A SERIOUS
INVESTIGATION, AND HE JUST WANTS
PEOPLE TO FOCUS ON SOMETHING
DIFFERENT, HERE'S A SHINY
OBJECT YOU CAN FOCUS ON SO YOU
DON'T TALK ABOUT OTHER ISSUES.
