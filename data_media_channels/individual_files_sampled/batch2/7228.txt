Anthony's scrum Moochie is the new White House communications right there ah I already miss John Spencer but this guy's got a bag of tricks to which I'm greatly amused by here's one of my favorite tweets of all time sir Moochie writes full transparency I'm deleting old tweets pass views evolved it shouldn't be a distraction I serve POTUS agenda and that's all that matters I'm not sure you know what the word transparency means it does not mean you delete everything you've ever written before see full transparency could mean the opposite that you would leave up the things that you wrote before but open the trunk White House is a woman obviously we got full transparency here burned everything don't leave anything behind okay so why is he gonna and by the way you're the communications director for the White House thing you don't know that we can access your old tweets it's gonna help you at all let alone all the other things they've said in the past he's called Trump quote on American dan and then he said about climate change the science of climate change is pretty much irrefutable at this point that's also true let's go to the next one because he said it on many occasions the science of climate change is pretty much your futile at this point and I find it tragic there's so many people in this country believe global warming is some sort of elaborate hoax perpetrated by every credible scientist on the planet in addition to the whole humanity angle investing the sustainable energy makes sense for an American national security perspective so who has called climate change of global hoax before all right President Trump he said it was a hoax invented by the Chinese to try to get an economic advantage even his own communications director thinks that's insane he also said I don't on the issue of gun control square Moochie said I don't support that legislation never had I have always been for his strong gun control laws damn we're gonna come back to that in a second when he's asked about it he's got a great excuse for it don't miss that on another issue said I am NOT in a for gay marriage against the death penalty and pro-choice I'm for social inclusion fiscal responsibility well have that Trump specifically he said I don't like the way he talks about women this were all of course before he was hired by Trump what did he see his new approach to Trump you're gonna love it all right one last one he said I voted for Obama oh no I voted for Obama I think most who have our disappointed he should have focused on jobs and not health care all right like at this point he appears to be the most liberal guy in the country trust me he's not he's for all about Wall Street tax cuts so he's one of those guys that are in the financial community we're like look dude I don't hate gay people or black people I just want all the money in the world okay so I want all the advantages to go to the rich the top of the financial industry and which monster do I have to support to make that happen oh you hate gays and blacks and women well that's unfortunate but yeah I'm voting for you and I'm working for you as long as you give me my goddamn tax cuts so that's Skrull Moochie in a nutshell but wait now let's be fair let's let him speak for himself let's go to why he deleted tweets in the first place but the truth be told on this threesome high deleted the tweets Chris it's a total distraction it's total nonsense when I made the decision to take this job my politics and my political ideas do not matter at all what matters is I am supporting all subordinating all of that to the President's agenda so basically by the way that's a the kernel of a fair answer look I'm not my own communications director I'm Trump's communications director so I'm serving him in that role so my opinions are not relevant they're only the pains of the president so I said well that would have been a perfectly fine answer but deleting the old tweets doesn't make any sense so he's basically saying look you know it's all this nonsense I just want to get rid of the nonsense but as with the pardon issue you're the one who started the nonsense nobody else is starting nonsense you wrote all that stuff so look these guys cover up for no damn reason sometimes they cover for very good reason but in this case just say like yeah those are my positions they're not the president's positions I can't delete them from the record nor do I want to but I'm gonna represent the president why can't you just say something so simple like that no instead he has to turn around and pretend he loved the president all along when he called him unamerican earlier and he didn't like the way that he talked about women let alone to screw with him on all those issues his new stance is this the last 18 months supporting him unyieldingly my lovely guys let me New Yorkers and this is my point I want to finish my point I love the guy because he's a great person and he's gonna be a phenomena is a phenomenal president he's even gonna be a better president I'm gonna be missile locked on focusing on the President's agenda and helping people to understand the president the way I know I'm in the way I love him I delete all that stuff about how I don't like him and now that it's to my financial benefit I love the guy Oh daily hug from him can't get enough of him I am missile lock on the president alright lastly a gun control issue he apparently didn't mean that stuff about being for gun control listen to how he frames it though was this when I wanted to put one of them on 2012 you tweeted we the USA has 5% of the world's population but 50% of the world's guns and nothing's enough it is just common sense to apply more controls question do you still believe that well okay so the answer the question is I'm a pro Second Amendment person my dad was a hunter I've got no problem with that what I would I what I was worried about in 2012 in urban centers if you don't have a little level of gun control it could it could lead to more violence yeah yeah yeah in other words when I was saying I was for gun control I meant for black people so I mean oh my dad loved to hunt I've come all for guns guns are great for white people but the urban centers is where we need gun control don't worry Republicans I'm on your side gun control only for them and not for us so now we get a sense of whose score Moochie really is and nobody's progressive and he didn't support Trump all along he's just thinking where do I get paid and what terrible thing do I have to say to make sure that money keeps coming in okay now we're very clear on who you are if you like this clip of The Young Turks you know there's a whole live two-hour show 6 to 8 p.m. Eastern every day and you
