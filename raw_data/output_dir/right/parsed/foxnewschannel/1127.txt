THE PRIMARIES AND IT'S THAT
LOYALTY TO THE PRESIDENT IS KEY.
BACK TO YOU.
>> Neil: AND IT PAID OFF.
THANKS VERY MUCH.
SO WHAT DOES THAT MEAN RIGHT NOW
AND WHAT DOES IT PORTEND ABOUT
HOW AGGRESSIVELY REPUBLICANS,
REPUBLICAN CANDIDATES USE THE
COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF, THE
PRESIDENT?
KARL ROVE WITH THOUGHTS ON THAT.
WHAT DID YOU THINK, KARL?
>> LOOK, CALIFORNIA IS GOOD NEWS
FOR REPUBLICANS.
THE DEMOCRATS TARGETED SEVEN
REPUBLICAN DISTRICTS THAT WERE
WON BY HILLARY CLINTON AND WERE
OCCUPIED BY REPUBLICAN.
A COUPLE OF THOSE RETIREMENTS.
IN SIX OF THE SEVEN, THE
COMBINED REPUBLICAN VOTE WAS
BIGGER THAN THE DEMOCRATIC VOTE
BY MARGINS OF FOUR POINTS TO 22
POINTS.
BECAUSE OF THE JUNGLE PRIMARY
DRAWS MORE OF WHAT LOOKS LIKE A
GENERAL ELECTORATE OUT,
EVERYBODY RUNS IN A BIG MESS AND
THE TWO TOP VOTE GETTERS GO INTO
A GENERAL ELECTION, SO THE
TURNOUT IS HIGHER 21% IN
CALIFORNIA VERSUS 11% IN
NEW JERSEY TURNOUT.
THE SAME NIGHT.
THIS IS GOOD NEWS FOR THE
REPUBLICANS.
THEY HAVE LOOKED LIKE THEY GOT
IN THESE DISTRICTS THAT THE
DEMOCRATS HOPED TO WIN.
THERE'S NOT A BLUE WAVE THAT IS
SINKING THEM.
REPUBLICAN ENTHUSIASM IS AS GOOD
OR HIGHER THAN THE DEMOCRATS IN
SEVEN OF SEVEN DISTRICTS.
>> Neil: WHAT IS INTERESTING,
WE'VE GONE THE DOUBLE DIGIT
DIFFERENTIAL BETWEEN VOTERS AND
WHAT SHOULD CONTROL CONGRESS IN
FAVOR OF DEMOCRATS TO NOW WITHIN
THE MARGIN OF ERROR A FEW SINGLE
POINTS.
DOES THAT MEAN TO YOU -- AND I
KNOW THINGS CAN CHANGE IN THE
MONTHS AHEAD -- THAT EVEN IF THE
DEMOCRATS ARE TO GAIN SEATS IN
THE HOUSE IT WILL NOT BE NEARLY
ENOUGH TO TIP THE BALANCE OF
POWER?
>> WELL, IF THE ELECTION WERE
TODAY, THE DYNAMIC IS THAT I
THINK THAT THAT MIGHT BE THE
CASE.
THEY WOULD TAKE IT VERY NARROWLY
BY ONE OR TWO SEATS OR LOSE IT.
THINK ABOUT IT.
THINK ABOUT IT, SINCE DECEMBER
21, THE GAP WAS 13 POINTS.
NOW IT'S 3.
THE PRESIDENT'S JOB APPROVAL IN
DECEMBER WAS IN THE -- WAS 37,
38, TODAY IT'S 43, 44.
NOT GREAT BUT BETTER THAN IT WAS
BEFORE.
WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT
EARLIER, THE UNDERLYING VIEW OF
THE ECONOMY.
THE PRESIDENT EXAGGERATES IT'S
THE BEST ECONOMY WE'VE EVER HAD.
PEOPLE ARE FEELING GOOD ABOUT
THE ECONOMY AND THEIR OWN
PERSONAL CIRCUMSTANCES.
SO ALL THREE OF THOSE THINGS
PLUS FOREIGN POLICY.
PEOPLE HAVE LOOKED IN THE LAST
COUPLE MONTHS AND REALIZED
THINGS CAN CHANGE DRAMATICALLY.
THEY LOOK AT SYRIA, THE TOUGH
ACTION THERE, GETTING OUT OF THE
IRAN NUCLEAR DEAL, THE NORTH
KOREA SO FAR, IT'S BEEN RAGGED
BUT LOOKS LIKE HE'S MAKING
PROGRESS.
NOW, YOU'RE RIGHT.
FIVE MONTHS BETWEEN NOW AND THE
ELECTION IS LIKE AN ETERNITY IN
POLITICS.
BUT GOING IN THE RIGHT
DIRECTION.
PRESTAGING THAT THIS IS NOT
LIKELY TO BE A YEAR WITH A BIG
BLUE WAVE.
IT'S LIKE TO BE THE
ANNIVERSARY -- THIS LOOKS LIKE
TRENCH WARFARE.
RACE BY RACE, DISTRICT BY
DISTRICT.
HOW GOOD IS YOUR CANDIDATE AND
