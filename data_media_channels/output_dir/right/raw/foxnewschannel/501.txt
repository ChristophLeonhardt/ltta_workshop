1
00:00:00,255 --> 00:00:01,189
IMPACTFUL, PASSIONATE

2
00:00:01,189 --> 00:00:02,724
SPEECHES EVER IN THAT

3
00:00:02,724 --> 00:00:03,091
COMMITTEE.

4
00:00:03,091 --> 00:00:04,393
TOM FITTON WAS IN THE ROOM

5
00:00:04,393 --> 00:00:04,893
AT THE TIME.

6
00:00:04,893 --> 00:00:06,728
HE WAS THE PRESIDENT OF

7
00:00:06,728 --> 00:00:08,063
JUDICIAL WATCH.

8
00:00:08,063 --> 00:00:11,233
TOM, WE DIDN'T HEAR ANY NEW

9
00:00:11,233 --> 00:00:11,833
DETAILS, REALLY.

10
00:00:11,833 --> 00:00:12,768
NO NEW EVIDENCE.

11
00:00:12,768 --> 00:00:15,137
SO WHERE ARE WE THIS

12
00:00:15,137 --> 00:00:15,470
MORNING?

13
00:00:15,470 --> 00:00:17,072
>> WELL, YOU KNOW, DESPITE

14
00:00:17,072 --> 00:00:18,974
THIS BIG CIRCUS OF A

15
00:00:18,974 --> 00:00:20,209
HEARING, IT DIDN'T ADVANCE

16
00:00:20,209 --> 00:00:21,410
THE BALL IN TERMS OF

17
00:00:21,410 --> 00:00:23,679
PROVIDING OH MY GOSH, HE

18
00:00:23,679 --> 00:00:25,047
CERTAINLY DID IT OR ANYTHING

19
00:00:25,047 --> 00:00:27,182
THAT WOULD SUGGEST THAT YOU

20
00:00:27,182 --> 00:00:29,017
CAN'T TRUST ANYTHING THIS

21
00:00:29,017 --> 00:00:30,319
WOMAN SAID, YOU KNOW, OTHER

22
00:00:30,319 --> 00:00:32,788
THAN THE FACT SHE HAD NO

23
00:00:32,788 --> 00:00:33,555
CORROBORATING EVIDENCE AND

24
00:00:33,555 --> 00:00:35,023
NO ONE SUPPORTED HER.

25
00:00:35,023 --> 00:00:36,091
OF COURSE WE KNEW THAT THE

26
00:00:36,091 --> 00:00:37,559
DAY BEFORE THE HEARING AND

27
00:00:37,559 --> 00:00:38,927
WE DIDN'T NEED A HEARING TO

28
00:00:38,927 --> 00:00:40,362
NOW KNOW WHAT WE KNOW TODAY

29
00:00:40,362 --> 00:00:42,064
WHICH IS WHY HIS CASE OR HIS

30
00:00:42,064 --> 00:00:43,265
CONFIRMATION IS GOING TO GO

31
00:00:43,265 --> 00:00:45,033
TO A VOTE LATER TODAY

32
00:00:45,033 --> 00:00:46,335
BECAUSE NOTHING NEW HAPPENED

33
00:00:46,335 --> 00:00:48,604
YESTERDAY OTHER THAN THE

34
00:00:48,604 --> 00:00:48,937
CIRCUS.

35
00:00:48,937 --> 00:00:50,039
AND I'M GLAD THE REPUBLICANS

36
00:00:50,039 --> 00:00:52,241
ARE SHUTTING THE CIRCUS

37
00:00:52,241 --> 00:00:52,541
DOWN.

38
00:00:52,541 --> 00:00:53,475
I DON'T THINK THEY HAVE

39
00:00:53,475 --> 00:00:54,576
MOVED TO THE COMMITTEE VOTE

40
00:00:54,576 --> 00:00:55,711
IF THEY DIDN'T THINK THEY

41
00:00:55,711 --> 00:00:57,413
HAD THE VOTES TO MOVE HIM

42
00:00:57,413 --> 00:00:58,580
OUT OF COMMITTEE AND

43
00:00:58,580 --> 00:00:59,815
ULTIMATELY TO CONFIRMATION.

44
00:00:59,815 --> 00:01:01,383
SO, DESPITE THE TORTURE AND

45
00:01:01,383 --> 00:01:03,953
IT WAS TORTURE AND IT WAS

46
00:01:03,953 --> 00:01:05,054
REALLY UNETHICAL WHAT THE

47
00:01:05,054 --> 00:01:07,489
SENATE DEMOCRATS PUT HIM

48
00:01:07,489 --> 00:01:09,258
THROUGH IN LEAGUE WITH HEIR

49
00:01:09,258 --> 00:01:10,760
LEFTIST ALLIES IT, LOOKS

50
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:11,660
LIKE JUDGE KAVANAUGH WILL BE

51
00:01:11,660 --> 00:01:12,661
THE NEXT SUPREME COURT

52
00:01:12,661 --> 00:01:14,296
JUSTICE BY THE MIDDLE OF

53
00:01:14,296 --> 00:01:14,730
NEXT WEEK.

54
00:01:14,730 --> 00:01:15,398
AINSLEY: TOM, YOU WERE IN

55
00:01:15,398 --> 00:01:17,633
THE ROOM, WE CAN SIT HERE ON

56
00:01:17,633 --> 00:01:18,634
THE COUCH AND TALK ABOUT

57
00:01:18,634 --> 00:01:19,769
THIS, BUT WE WEREN'T

58
00:01:19,769 --> 00:01:20,369
ACTUALLY IN THE ROOM.

59
00:01:20,369 --> 00:01:21,704
WHAT WAS IT LIKE TO BE IN

60
00:01:21,704 --> 00:01:23,339
THE ROOM WHEN LINDSEY GRAHAM

61
00:01:23,339 --> 00:01:24,273
MADE THOSE STATEMENTS?

62
00:01:24,273 --> 00:01:26,275
>> OH, IT WAS HIGH DRAMA.

63
00:01:26,275 --> 00:01:28,144
I COULD SEE SENATOR GRAHAM

64
00:01:28,144 --> 00:01:29,879
EVEN BEFORE THAT WAS

65
00:01:29,879 --> 00:01:31,781
REACTING QUITE STRONGLY.

66
00:01:31,781 --> 00:01:32,915
YOU ARE SITTING THERE AND

67
00:01:32,915 --> 00:01:34,350
CAN YOU SEE HIM ALMOST

68
00:01:34,350 --> 00:01:35,751
POPPING OUT OF HIS CHAIR IN

69
00:01:35,751 --> 00:01:36,886
RESPONSE TO SOME OF WHAT WAS

70
00:01:36,886 --> 00:01:37,553
GOING ON.

71
00:01:37,553 --> 00:01:39,288
AND GOING BACK TO THE

72
00:01:39,288 --> 00:01:40,222
BEGINNING OF THE HEARING

73
00:01:40,222 --> 00:01:42,491
BEFORE DR. FORD TESTIFIED,

74
00:01:42,491 --> 00:01:44,093
GUYS THAT TENSION IN THAT

75
00:01:44,093 --> 00:01:46,128
ROOM WAS INCREDIBLE.

76
00:01:46,128 --> 00:01:47,630
AND YOU COULD CUT IT WITH A

77
00:01:47,630 --> 00:01:47,930
KNIFE.

78
00:01:47,930 --> 00:01:49,332
AND EVERYONE WAS PAYING VERY

79
00:01:49,332 --> 00:01:50,933
CLOSE ATTENTION TO WHAT SHE

80
00:01:50,933 --> 00:01:51,267
SAID.

81
00:01:51,267 --> 00:01:52,735
AND THEN LATER IN THE DAY

82
00:01:52,735 --> 00:01:55,771
JUDGE KAVANAUGH CAME IN, AND

83
00:01:55,771 --> 00:01:58,407
DEFENDED HIMSELF QUITE ABLY

84
00:01:58,407 --> 00:02:01,310
AND WENT AT THE HEARING, THE

85
00:02:01,310 --> 00:02:03,813
SENATORS THERE FROM THE

86
00:02:03,813 --> 00:02:04,880
DEMOCRATIC SIDE QUITE

87
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:05,248
DIRECTLY.

88
00:02:05,248 --> 00:02:06,249
YOU DON'T NECESSARILY GET

89
00:02:06,249 --> 00:02:07,617
THAT FROM THE CAMERAS, THEY

90
00:02:07,617 --> 00:02:08,818
WERE HELD TO ACCOUNT.

91
00:02:08,818 --> 00:02:10,419
I HAVE TO SAY, I THOUGHT THE

92
00:02:10,419 --> 00:02:13,789
DEMOCRATS HAD THE ADVANTAGE,

93
00:02:13,789 --> 00:02:14,690
EVEN THROUGH JUDGE

94
00:02:14,690 --> 00:02:16,059
KAVANAUGH'S OPENING

95
00:02:16,059 --> 00:02:16,426
TESTIMONY.

96
00:02:16,426 --> 00:02:18,928
IT WAS DRAMATIC BUT THE

97
00:02:18,928 --> 00:02:20,363
DEMOCRATS LOST WHEN THEY

98
00:02:20,363 --> 00:02:22,298
BEGAN OPENING THEIR MOUTHS

99
00:02:22,298 --> 00:02:23,266
QUESTIONING HIM BECAUSE THE

100
00:02:23,266 --> 00:02:24,534
VALE WAS LIFTED.

101
00:02:24,534 --> 00:02:27,804
YOU COULD SEE THEY WERE

102
00:02:27,804 --> 00:02:28,238
DISHONEST.

103
00:02:28,238 --> 00:02:29,072
STEVE: FBI, FBI, FBI.

104
00:02:29,072 --> 00:02:31,307
>> ONE OF THE WORST THINGS

105
00:02:31,307 --> 00:02:33,309
IS HAVING HIM I FORGET WHO

106
00:02:33,309 --> 00:02:33,943
WAS QUESTIONING HIM ABOUT

107
00:02:33,943 --> 00:02:35,144
THE YEARBOOK.

108
00:02:35,144 --> 00:02:36,112
GIANTS POSTERS OF THE

109
00:02:36,112 --> 00:02:39,649
YEARBOOK AND YOU SAW THE

110
00:02:39,649 --> 00:02:40,083
ABSURDITY.

111
00:02:40,083 --> 00:02:40,717
BRIAN: SENATOR WHITEHOUSE.

112
00:02:40,717 --> 00:02:41,384
>> ALL THE CREDIBILITY THEY

113
00:02:41,384 --> 00:02:43,319
THOUGHT THEY HAD JUST WENT

114
00:02:43,319 --> 00:02:44,587
OUT THE DOOR WHEN YOU HAVE

115
00:02:44,587 --> 00:02:46,356
THIS POOR MAN'S YEARBOOK

116
00:02:46,356 --> 00:02:48,091
BEING RAISED AS IF IT WAS A

117
00:02:48,091 --> 00:02:49,025
PIECE OF EVIDENCE AGAINST

118
00:02:49,025 --> 00:02:49,292
HIM.

119
00:02:49,292 --> 00:02:51,327
IT WAS ABSURD.

120
00:02:51,327 --> 00:02:52,795
BRIAN: TOM, THE WHOLE IDEA

121
00:02:52,795 --> 00:02:54,097
IS THIS DO YOU BELIEVE TO

122
00:02:54,097 --> 00:02:57,066
BELIEVE FORD OR KAVANAUGH'S

123
00:02:57,066 --> 00:02:57,500
AUTHENTICITY.

124
00:02:57,500 --> 00:02:59,068
IF FORD WANTED TO KEEP

125
00:02:59,068 --> 00:03:00,136
ANONYMITY THAT WAS THROWN IN

126
00:03:00,136 --> 00:03:01,671
THE STREET AGAINST HER WILL

127
00:03:01,671 --> 00:03:04,073
IF WE ARE TO BELIEVE WHAT WE

128
00:03:04,073 --> 00:03:04,374
HEAR.

129
00:03:04,374 --> 00:03:05,308
DIANNE FEINSTEIN HAD IT,

130
00:03:05,308 --> 00:03:06,643
HELD IT AND SUDDENLY OUT

131
00:03:06,643 --> 00:03:06,943
THERE.

132
00:03:06,943 --> 00:03:08,078
WHY WAS IT OUT THERE AND WHY

133
00:03:08,078 --> 00:03:09,913
WAS HER NAME RELEASED?

134
00:03:09,913 --> 00:03:11,147
SHE COULD HAVE BEEN HONEST

135
00:03:11,147 --> 00:03:12,749
AND GOTTEN TO THE BOTTOM OF

136
00:03:12,749 --> 00:03:13,049
THIS.

137
00:03:13,049 --> 00:03:14,384
ONE ON ONE THEY COULD HAVE

138
00:03:14,384 --> 00:03:15,552
GOTTEN ALLEGATIONS OUT AND

139
00:03:15,552 --> 00:03:16,786
THEY DIDN'T DO IT.

140
00:03:16,786 --> 00:03:19,022
HERE IS SENATOR DIANNE

141
00:03:19,022 --> 00:03:19,856
FEINSTEIN DENYING THAT SHE

142
00:03:19,856 --> 00:03:20,356
LEAKED THE LETTER.

143
00:03:20,356 --> 00:03:23,259
>> MR. CHAIRMAN, LET ME BE

144
00:03:23,259 --> 00:03:25,528
CLEAR, DID I NOT HIDE

145
00:03:25,528 --> 00:03:27,497
DR. FORD'S ALLEGATIONS.

146
00:03:27,497 --> 00:03:29,299
I DID NOT LEAK HER STORY,

147
00:03:29,299 --> 00:03:32,469
SHE ASKED ME TO HOLD IT

148
00:03:32,469 --> 00:03:33,503
CONFIDENTIAL, AND I KEPT IT

149
00:03:33,503 --> 00:03:36,106
CONFIDENTIAL AS SHE ASKED.

150
00:03:36,106 --> 00:03:39,443
SHE APPARENTLY WAS STALKED

151
00:03:39,443 --> 00:03:41,011
BY THE PRESS, FELT THAT WHAT

152
00:03:41,011 --> 00:03:43,013
HAPPENED, SHE WAS FORCED TO

153
00:03:43,013 --> 00:03:45,916
COME FORWARD, AND HER

154
00:03:45,916 --> 00:03:48,652
GREATEST FEAR WERE

155
00:03:48,652 --> 00:03:49,786
REALIZED -- WAS REALIZED.

156
00:03:49,786 --> 00:03:50,721
SHE HAS BEEN HARASSED.

157
00:03:50,721 --> 00:03:51,989
SHE HAS HAD DEATH THREATS

158
00:03:51,989 --> 00:03:54,358
AND SHE HAS HAD TO FLEE HER

159
00:03:54,358 --> 00:03:54,725
HOME.

160
00:03:54,725 --> 00:03:56,426
BRIAN: WHY WAS SHE STALKED

161
00:03:56,426 --> 00:03:57,194
BY THE PRESS?

162
00:03:57,194 --> 00:03:59,696
BECAUSE HER NAME LEAKED OUT.

163
00:03:59,696 --> 00:04:00,530
>> THROUGH THE DEMOCRATIC

164
00:04:00,530 --> 00:04:01,865
SIDE OF THE AISLE THERE.

165
00:04:01,865 --> 00:04:03,433
YOU KNOW WHAT I THINK CAME

166
00:04:03,433 --> 00:04:05,836
OUT YESTERDAY WAS SENATOR

167
00:04:05,836 --> 00:04:06,370
FEINSTEIN'S CORRUPT

168
00:04:06,370 --> 00:04:07,204
OPERATION WHERE THEY

169
00:04:07,204 --> 00:04:08,338
WITHHELD THE FACT THAT THEY

170
00:04:08,338 --> 00:04:10,307
KNEW ABOUT THESE ALLEGATIONS

171
00:04:10,307 --> 00:04:12,943
WHILE THEY WERE QUESTIONING

172
00:04:12,943 --> 00:04:13,844
JUDGE KAVANAUGH, SO THEY

173
00:04:13,844 --> 00:04:15,345
KNEW THEY HAD THIS HERE.

174
00:04:15,345 --> 00:04:16,846
THEY COULD HAVE ASKED THE

175
00:04:16,846 --> 00:04:18,281
FBI TO DO A QUICK INTERVIEW

176
00:04:18,281 --> 00:04:19,182
WEEKS AGO.

177
00:04:19,182 --> 00:04:21,418
AND, ON TOP OF THAT

178
00:04:21,418 --> 00:04:22,619
FEINSTEIN'S STAFF IS

179
00:04:22,619 --> 00:04:23,754
RECOMMENDING HER LAWYERS

180
00:04:23,754 --> 00:04:26,290
FURTHER UNDERMINING HER

181
00:04:26,290 --> 00:04:28,725
CREDIBILITY TO THE DETRIMENT

182
00:04:28,725 --> 00:04:30,727
OF THE ACCUSER.

183
00:04:30,727 --> 00:04:31,828
SINCE THE CORRUPTION OF THE

184
00:04:31,828 --> 00:04:32,863
DEMOCRATIC SIDE HERE WAS

185
00:04:32,863 --> 00:04:34,765
EXPOSE YOU HAD, AND, YOU

186
00:04:34,765 --> 00:04:37,467
KNOW, WE HAVE TO REMEMBER

187
00:04:37,467 --> 00:04:39,036
THEY ARE ALSO PUSHING OUT

188
00:04:39,036 --> 00:04:40,170
FALSE ALLEGATIONS THAT CAME

189
00:04:40,170 --> 00:04:42,072
OUT SUBSEQUENTLY AGAINST

190
00:04:42,072 --> 00:04:43,206
JUDGE KAVANAUGH THAT WERE

191
00:04:43,206 --> 00:04:46,710
ABSURD ON THEIR FACE AND I'M

192
00:04:46,710 --> 00:04:48,211
NOT GOING TO REPEAT THEM

193
00:04:48,211 --> 00:04:49,546
BECAUSE THEY DON'T DESERVE

194
00:04:49,546 --> 00:04:49,947
REPETITION.

195
00:04:49,947 --> 00:04:51,982
THIS MAN HAS HAD HIS

196
00:04:51,982 --> 00:04:52,783
REPUTATION DRAGGED THROUGH

197
00:04:52,783 --> 00:04:53,951
THE MUD ENOUGH.

198
00:04:53,951 --> 00:04:56,587
AGAIN, THE DEMOCRATS LOST

199
00:04:56,587 --> 00:04:58,155
YESTERDAY, THANKFULLY, NOT

200
00:04:58,155 --> 00:04:59,323
BECAUSE ANYONE OPPOSES THEM

201
00:04:59,323 --> 00:05:01,258
IN A PARTISAN WAY, IT'S

202
00:05:01,258 --> 00:05:02,693
BECAUSE THIS PROCESS WOULD

203
00:05:02,693 --> 00:05:04,695
HAVE RUINED THE SENATE IF IT

204
00:05:04,695 --> 00:05:06,096
WAS ALLOWED TO GO THROUGH

205
00:05:06,096 --> 00:05:07,965
THE WAY THEY WANTED TO GO

206
00:05:07,965 --> 00:05:09,833
THROUGH, WHICH IS TO RAISE

207
00:05:09,833 --> 00:05:10,968
ALLEGATIONS WITHOUT

208
00:05:10,968 --> 00:05:11,368
EVIDENCE.

209
00:05:11,368 --> 00:05:12,836
THIS WOMAN THEY BELIEVE WHAT

210
00:05:12,836 --> 00:05:13,904
SHE SAYS THEY BELIEVE.

211
00:05:13,904 --> 00:05:16,106
YOU CAN BELIEVE HER AND HAVE

212
00:05:16,106 --> 00:05:16,940
SYMPATHY FOR HER.

213
00:05:16,940 --> 00:05:18,408
IT ISN'T ENOUGH TO DERAIL

214
00:05:18,408 --> 00:05:20,210
THIS MAN'S NOMINATION,

215
00:05:20,210 --> 00:05:21,311
DESTROY HIS REPUTATION.

216
00:05:21,311 --> 00:05:22,413
THIS IS WHY IT SHOULD HAVE

217
00:05:22,413 --> 00:05:23,580
BEEN HELD PRIVATELY.

218
00:05:23,580 --> 00:05:25,382
YOU COULD HAVE EVALUATED HER

219
00:05:25,382 --> 00:05:27,051
AND SAID YOU KNOW WHAT?

220
00:05:27,051 --> 00:05:29,286
WE APPRECIATE YOU THINK THAT

221
00:05:29,286 --> 00:05:30,087
HAPPENED 35 YEARS AGO.

222
00:05:30,087 --> 00:05:32,122
THERE IS NOT ENOUGH EVIDENCE

223
00:05:32,122 --> 00:05:33,290
TO DERAIL THIS NOMINATION.

224
00:05:33,290 --> 00:05:36,594
WE ARE NOT GOING TO TORTURE

225
00:05:36,594 --> 00:05:39,263
YOU BY GOING THROUGH PUBLIC

226
00:05:39,263 --> 00:05:40,397
RECITATION AND HIM.

227
00:05:40,397 --> 00:05:41,565
BOTH WERE ABUSED.

228
00:05:41,565 --> 00:05:43,234
THE SENATE OWES JUDGE

229
00:05:43,234 --> 00:05:44,268
KAVANAUGH AN APOLOGY.

230
00:05:44,268 --> 00:05:46,070
THE BEST APOLOGY WOULD BE TO

231
00:05:46,070 --> 00:05:47,271
CONFIRM HIM AS QUICKLY AS

232
00:05:47,271 --> 00:00:00,000
POSSIBLE THOUGH.
