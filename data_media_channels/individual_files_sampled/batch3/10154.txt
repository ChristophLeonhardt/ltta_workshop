WikiLeaks is claiming that the CIA's created a computer program that impersonates the software of the Russian antivirus company Kaspersky Lab let's get more details on this story while correspondent caleb mopping caleb good to see you what else then is in these revelations well we've got a new batch of documents from the vault eight of wikileaks this new batch of documents that's been released showing some of the internal workings of the CIA particularly in relation to software now what was released as a program called hive and essentially this is a major component of CIA infrastructure and malware and it provides covert communications about how the CIA operates and what kind of software and malware that they're using now one thing that was revealed in these in these documents is that essentially the CIA had a program to imitate Kaspersky laboratory now this is a huge popular Russian software company and it's recently been subject to scandal US authorities have actually banned any government agencies from using Kaspersky laboratories citing concerns about national security this happened back in September and it was recently reported by The Wall Street Journal that Russian hackers had stolen u.s. cyber secrets from the National Security Agency by using software that was developed by Kaspersky Laboratory this is actually what was said by Elaine Duke of the Homeland Security Department of the United States the risk that the Russian government whether acting on its own or in collaboration with Kaspersky could capitalize on access provided by Kaspersky products to compromised federal information and information systems directly implicates u.s. national security now there has been a response to these allegations from Kaspersky laboratory they said quote the company has never helped nor will help any government in the world with its cyber espionage or offensive efforts they made clear they had nothing to do with any hacking or stealing of information to that effect and now we see revealed in this backup batch of WikiLeaks documents that the CIA specifically has a program developed for the purpose of imitating this popular Russian software company essentially making activities look like they're being done by Kaspersky Laboratory in fact there are three examples of source code that's used to build a fake certificate for antivirus software to make it look like it originated with Kaspersky laboratory so quite an interesting development all these allegations have been leveled against Kaspersky laboratory this very popular and very large Russian software company and we now see that the CIA had a specific program designed to make it look like activities were being done by Kaspersky to imitate and leave essentially false digital fingerprints for Kaspersky laboratory a very interesting development yeah absolutely and we'll we'll stick with the story a little bit more money thanks for now Kayla more pin they're in New York now vault eight is a new series of WikiLeaks publications on a huge tranche of leaked CIA files it details the revelations in the previous batch called vault seven which revealed the agency had its own malware exploited vulnerabilities in phones and TVs and had the ability to bypass encryption on messaging apps that's springing forward British intelligence officer Annie mash on hmm I think safe to say most people won't be trusting the CIA anytime soon but we shouldn't be surprised should we this is kind of what they do there's spy agency are you surprised by any of this or the scope of their operations not at all no I mean intelligence agencies have had this level of capability even in the analog era it was just much more targeted much more resource intensive of course with the internet it's opened up huge new opportunities for them to master the Internet which is one of the phrases that came out of the Snowden leaks a few years ago but in this case of course the WikiLeaks CIA vault 7 and vaults 8 revelations are fascinating because the vault 7 revelations last year revealed that for example the CIA actually make a hack look at it like it had come from Russia under the codename umbrage from China under marble and under many many other countries so it's actually really mucked up to a whole concept of forensic ating any hack attacks that go on around the world so I suppose it was inevitable it would move on to looking at corporations that were had a gold standard of providing protection around the world for companies and also the American government by the way Kaspersky is a highly reputable it's been operating for a couple of decades it has about four hundred million users around the world including until very recently the American government so you know if they're going to do that to whole countries of course they're going to do it to competitive and competitor corporations around the world - okay the thing I will glean from all of that is if anybody accuses anyone else of having carried out a hack I won't believe it because you just never know how much smoke is involved in a smokescreen why would the CIA choose Kaspersky Lab and it's been a fascinating few months with Kaspersky in the doghouse big scandal over them and now we've got the CIA revealed as being able to impersonate Kaspersky but but why then there seems to be quite a lot of history I mean obviously the CIA will be interested in a very successful Russian based company that offers protection on the Internet but it goes back a bit further because I think it was 2010 the very first proven cyber warfare weapon was deployed and this was against the Iranian domestic civilian nuclear development capability and this was at the time when the Americans were drumming drumming up against the war against Iran and there was an attack made against their civilian nuclear capability and in this case this virus which was called stunner Stuxnet was deployed against the centrifuges that that enriched uranium and nobody knew where it came from it seemed to be very weaponized a state level and it was actually Kaspersky that unveiled who had developed it and it was the Americans and the Israeli intelligence agencies so ever since then there's been sort of daggers drawn between these two competing sides and kaspersky has been very much in the crosshairs of both the American and the Israeli intelligence agencies and so it has evolved since then where we have Kaspersky saying you know we can do this we can prove that some of these hacks are not Russian they're American when it comes to Russia gate in America and the presidential elections so they needed to discredit them and I think that this new application of a virus a state level very aggressive virus that will discredit a very proven brand around the world is exactly what the Americans would want and the Israelis as what also would want fascinating insights there I think much appreciated your time that former British intelligence officer Annie Machon is my guest Thank You Annie
