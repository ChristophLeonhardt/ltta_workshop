now some police were worried about this not the top brass they're politically correct of course but regular cops who didn't go to the police academy to be bellhops they went to protect Canada so they saw this stream of unvetted self-selected young men walking across the border to Canada many of them clearly Muslim and they thought yeah we're in the age of Isis Isis terrorists have embedded themselves in waves of refugees to Europe Europe then had a terrorist attack almost every week from Muslim terrorists who just walked in maybe we should ask a few gentle questions of these illegal immigrants foreign citizens whose first act on Canadian Scarlets to break Canadian law these are not Canadian citizens of course they're not law-abiding people at all of course they're tricksters they're schemers they're gaming the system many are fleeing Trump not just for being illegal immigrants but for committing other crimes too so some Canadian police started asking very gentle questions of these illegal Muslim migrants about their views on Canadian society gentle questions like you okay with we women being free here are you okay with that are you okay with equality of men and women with gay rights with women not being covered by burkas are you part of a terrorist group pretty basic questions easy enough to lie about I guess but I suppose asking something is better than asking nothing well when the Toronto Star heard about that they went ballistic and when the Liberals read about that Bay went ballistic and they all bullied the police ordered them to stop asking such mean questions of these lawbreakers you see being a feminist to Justin Trudeau and the Liberals it means virtue signaling and scolding conservatives for not being woke enough it's about stopping people from man spreading on the subway you know when you sit with your legs too far apart sitting with their legs too far apart but but it doesn't actually mean you know seeing if some men believe in polygamy or honor killings if they come to Canada has too many Muslims do so Justin Trudeau canceled the questionnaire we know that but look at today's news 5,000 interviews with Muslim migrants 5,000 records about Islamic illegal immigrants the illegals by the way have been ordered deleted deleted so we have intelligence about possible Islamic extremists Muslims who perhaps say they don't like the separation of mosque and state who perhaps say they don't believe that women should have equal rights who express other on Canadian ideas perhaps even violent ideas and we're just deleting those records that's an excerpt from my daily TV show the Ezra Levant show no one leaves behind a paywall but I thought you'd like this video so we put it on youtube if you want to subscribe to watch the daily show every day including always two interviews today and I read my hate mail just click on this screen and become a Premium Member you
