1
00:00:01,768 --> 00:00:03,770
OF AMERICANS PRETTY STRONGLY 

2
00:00:03,770 --> 00:00:04,270
AGAINST THIS POLICY. 

3
00:00:04,270 --> 00:00:06,072
THAT SAID, I THINK REPUBLICANS, 

4
00:00:06,072 --> 00:00:07,340
YOU KNOW, WOULD LOVE TO MOVE ON 

5
00:00:07,340 --> 00:00:09,175
FOR THE MOST PART AND TALK 

6
00:00:09,175 --> 00:00:09,842
ABOUT PRETTY MUCH ANYTHING ELSE 

7
00:00:09,842 --> 00:00:12,245
AT THIS POINT, I GUESS WITH THE 

8
00:00:12,245 --> 00:00:12,946
EXCEPTION OF MAYBE ROBERT 

9
00:00:12,946 --> 00:00:13,246
MUELLER. 

10
00:00:13,246 --> 00:00:14,848
BUT EVEN THAT I THINK KIND OF 

11
00:00:14,848 --> 00:00:18,485
IS LESS UPSETTING  TO A LOT OF 

12
00:00:18,485 --> 00:00:20,887
THE COUNTRY THAN THESE REPORTS 

13
00:00:20,887 --> 00:00:21,320
FROM TEXAS. 

14
00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:23,890
>> JAMES, THE PRESIDENT TODAY 

15
00:00:23,890 --> 00:00:24,991
SAID HIS ACTION WAS PRE-EMPTIVE 

16
00:00:24,991 --> 00:00:26,493
BUT WOULD BE BACKED BY 

17
00:00:26,493 --> 00:00:26,960
LEGISLATION WHICH IS 

18
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:28,394
INTERESTING ON ANOTHER POINT 

19
00:00:28,394 --> 00:00:29,796
BECAUSE HE WAS AGAINST D.A.C.A. 

20
00:00:29,796 --> 00:00:31,197
APPARENT BECAUSE IT WAS AN 

21
00:00:31,197 --> 00:00:33,199
EXECUTIVE ACTION BY PRESIDENT 

22
00:00:33,199 --> 00:00:34,501
OBAMA, BUT THAT'S A SEPARATE 

23
00:00:34,501 --> 00:00:34,734
ISSUE. 

24
00:00:34,734 --> 00:00:36,069
THE HOUSE WILL VOTE AGAIN 

25
00:00:36,069 --> 00:00:38,238
TOMORROW ON ANOTHER BILL, 

26
00:00:38,238 --> 00:00:40,740
PREVIOUS REPUBLICAN EFFORTS TO 

27
00:00:40,740 --> 00:00:41,374
PASS COMPREHENSIVE IMMIGRATION 

28
00:00:41,374 --> 00:00:41,974
BILLS HAVE FAILED. 

29
00:00:41,974 --> 00:00:43,877
SO WHAT MAKES THEM CONFIDENT 

30
00:00:43,877 --> 00:00:45,010
THAT THEY CAN GET THROUGH? 

31
00:00:45,010 --> 00:00:47,247
AND WHAT HAPPENS IF IT GETS TO 

32
00:00:47,247 --> 00:00:47,880
THE SENATE? 

33
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:49,048
>> THEY'RE NOT CONFIDENT THAT 

34
00:00:49,048 --> 00:00:50,549
THEY CAN GET THIS THROUGH. 

35
00:00:50,549 --> 00:00:51,484
THEY CURRENTLY DON'T HAVE THE 

36
00:00:51,484 --> 00:00:51,717
VOTES. 

37
00:00:51,717 --> 00:00:52,351
AND THE MEETING WHERE THE 

38
00:00:52,351 --> 00:00:54,287
PRESIDENT ANNOUNCED THAT HE'S 

39
00:00:54,287 --> 00:00:57,090
GOING TO BE SIGNING SOMETHING 

40
00:00:57,090 --> 00:00:58,157
LATER TODAY, THAT WAS A MEETING 

41
00:00:58,157 --> 00:00:59,192
WITH PEOPLE -- THE HOUSE 

42
00:00:59,192 --> 00:00:59,893
REPUBLICAN LEADERSHIP GAVE A 

43
00:00:59,893 --> 00:01:01,094
LIST TO THE WHITE HOUSE AND 

44
00:01:01,094 --> 00:01:02,495
SAID THESE ARE THE PEOPLE WHO 

45
00:01:02,495 --> 00:01:04,096
ARE ON THE FENCE, THESE ARE 

46
00:01:04,096 --> 00:01:06,299
PEOPLE WHOSE VOTES WE NEED FOR 

47
00:01:06,299 --> 00:01:07,100
THIS COMPROMISED IMMIGRATION 

48
00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:08,301
BILL, OTHERWISE IT'S GOING TO 

49
00:01:08,301 --> 00:01:08,568
FAIL. 

50
00:01:08,568 --> 00:01:09,502
SO THE IDEA OF BRINGING TRUMP 

51
00:01:09,502 --> 00:01:11,437
TO THE CAPITOL LAST NIGHT AND 

52
00:01:11,437 --> 00:01:12,037
THEN BRINGING THOSE LAWMAKERS 

53
00:01:12,037 --> 00:01:13,773
TO THE WHITE HOUSE TODAY WAS TO 

54
00:01:13,773 --> 00:01:15,641
TRY AND TWIST SOME ARMS TO GET 

55
00:01:15,641 --> 00:01:18,578
TO 218 VOTES WHICH IS HOW MANY 

56
00:01:18,578 --> 00:01:19,646
THEY NEED TO PASS THE BILL. 

57
00:01:19,646 --> 00:01:20,780
I THINK PAUL RYAN HAS PROMISED 

58
00:01:20,780 --> 00:01:22,048
MODERATES THAT HE'S GOING TO 

59
00:01:22,048 --> 00:01:25,185
BRING THE BILL UP FOR A VOTE, 

60
00:01:25,185 --> 00:01:25,819
AN UP-OR-DOWN VOTE, WHETHER 

61
00:01:25,819 --> 00:01:27,187
THEY HAVE THE SUPPORT THEY NEED 

62
00:01:27,187 --> 00:01:28,288
TO GET IT TO PASS. 

63
00:01:28,288 --> 00:01:30,590
AND SO THERE IS SOME CHANCE 

64
00:01:30,590 --> 00:01:31,991
THAT IT COULD STILL GO DOWN. 

65
00:01:31,991 --> 00:01:32,659
NOW, WHAT'S HAPPENED 

66
00:01:32,659 --> 00:01:34,194
INTERESTINGLY WITH THIS ORDER, 

67
00:01:34,194 --> 00:01:36,496
ALTHOUGH, AS I MENTIONED, IT'S 

68
00:01:36,496 --> 00:01:37,563
NUANCED, IS THIS DOES TAKE SOME 

69
00:01:37,563 --> 00:01:38,698
PRESSURE OFF CERTAIN LAWMAKERS 

70
00:01:38,698 --> 00:01:41,600
WHO FELT LIKE THEY HAD TO VOTE 

71
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:43,303
FOR SOMETHING TO SHOW 

72
00:01:43,303 --> 00:01:44,870
OPPOSITION TO FAMILY 

73
00:01:44,870 --> 00:01:45,170
SEPARATION. 

74
00:01:45,170 --> 00:01:46,973
NOW THEY WON'T FEEL THAT KIND 

75
00:01:46,973 --> 00:01:47,874
OF SAME PRESSURE. 

76
00:01:47,874 --> 00:01:49,542
AND IN SOME WAYS IT TAKES AWAY 

77
00:01:49,542 --> 00:01:52,145
SOME OF THE LEVERAGE THAT THE 

78
00:01:52,145 --> 00:01:53,847
WHITE HOUSE AND LEADERSHIP HAD 

79
00:01:53,847 --> 00:01:56,449
TO GET CERTAIN REPUBLICANS TO 

80
00:01:56,449 --> 00:01:57,349
VOTE FOR THE BILL TOMORROW. 

81
00:01:57,349 --> 00:01:57,683
>> ABSOLUTLY. 

82
00:01:57,683 --> 00:02:00,019
JAMES HOHMANN, THANK YOU FOR 

83
00:02:00,019 --> 00:02:00,720
YOUR TIME. 

84
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:01,153
>> MY PLEASURE. 

85
00:02:01,153 --> 00:02:02,288
>>>  AMERICAN AIRLINES IS 

86
00:02:02,288 --> 00:02:04,490
TELLING THE GOVERNMENT NOT TO 

87
00:02:04,490 --> 00:02:06,392
USE IT TO TRANSPORT IMMIGRANT 

88
00:02:06,392 --> 00:02:07,994
CHILDREN TORN FROM THEIR 

89
00:02:07,994 --> 00:02:08,261
FAMILIES. 

90
00:02:08,261 --> 00:02:09,628
THE AIRLINE RELEASED A 

91
00:02:09,628 --> 00:02:10,597
STATEMENT SAYING, QUOTE, THE 

92
00:02:10,597 --> 00:02:12,198
FAMILY SEPARATION PROCESS THAT 

93
00:02:12,198 --> 00:02:14,400
HAS BEEN WIDELY PUBLICIZED IS 

94
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:16,803
NOT AT ALL ALIGNED WITH THE 

95
00:02:16,803 --> 00:02:18,437
VALUES OF AMERICAN AIRLINES. 

96
00:02:18,437 --> 00:02:20,473
WE BRING FAMILIES TOGETHER, NOT 

97
00:02:20,473 --> 00:02:20,740
APART. 

98
00:02:20,740 --> 00:02:22,275
WE HAVE THEREFORE REQUESTED THE 

99
00:02:22,275 --> 00:02:22,875
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO 

100
00:02:22,875 --> 00:02:24,877
IMMEDIATELY REFRAIN FROM USING 

101
00:02:24,877 --> 00:02:26,079
AMERICAN FOR THE PURPOSE OF 

102
00:02:26,079 --> 00:02:27,580
TRANSPORTING CHILDREN WHO HAVE 

103
00:02:27,580 --> 00:02:29,148
BEEN SEPARATED FROM THEIR 

104
00:02:29,148 --> 00:02:29,415
FAMILIES. 

105
00:02:29,415 --> 00:02:32,585
WE HAVE NO DESIRE TO BE 

106
00:02:32,585 --> 00:02:33,185
ASSOCIATED WITH SEPARATING 

107
00:02:33,185 --> 00:02:34,787
FAMILIES OR WORSE, TO PROFIT 

108
00:02:34,787 --> 00:02:35,054
FROM IT. 

109
00:02:35,054 --> 00:02:36,689
>>>  THE CHILDREN WERE LIKELY 

110
00:02:36,689 --> 00:02:38,591
BEING BOOKED ON SCHEDULED 

111
00:02:38,591 --> 00:02:39,792
FLIGHTS AS REGULAR PASSENGERS. 

112
00:02:39,792 --> 00:02:41,694
THEY ARE LIKELY AROUND 12 YEARS 

113
00:02:41,694 --> 00:02:42,261
OLD AND UP. 

114
00:02:42,261 --> 00:02:44,697
SOME REPORTS SAID THEY MAY HAVE 

115
00:02:44,697 --> 00:02:47,200
BEEN AS YOUNG AS 6 YEARS OLD. 

116
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:48,001
AMERICAN AIRLINES DISPUTES 

117
00:02:48,001 --> 00:02:48,201
THAT. 

118
00:02:48,201 --> 00:02:49,802
>>> COMING UP AFTER A BREAK, 

119
00:02:49,802 --> 00:02:51,771
THE PRESIDENT HEADS TO 

120
00:02:51,771 --> 00:02:53,005
MINNESOTA FOR A RALLY. 

121
00:02:53,005 --> 00:02:54,674
WE WILL LOOK AT WHY. 

122
00:02:54,674 --> 00:02:56,742
>>>  PLUS TRAGEDY IN INDONESIA 

123
00:02:56,742 --> 00:03:01,280
AFTER A FERRY SINKS WITH 

124
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:01,847
HUNDREDS ON BOARD. 

125
00:03:01,847 --> 00:03:02,248
YOU'RE STREAMING CBSN. 

126
00:05:31,798 --> 00:05:33,899

WEEK. 

130
00:05:39,672 --> 00:05:41,474
THE BOAT WAS FIVE TIMES OVER

ITS PASSENGER CAPACITY OF 43

SO FAR ONLY 18 SURVIVORS HAVE 

135
00:05:49,582 --> 00:05:49,915
BEEN FOUND. 

136
00:05:49,915 --> 00:05:52,518

137
00:05:52,518 --> 00:05:53,586
TWO EVENTS IN MINNESOTA

TONIGHT.

HE WILL PARTICIPATE IN WHAT'S 

140
00:05:56,322 --> 00:06:00,092
BEING BILLED AS A ROUNDTABLE ON

00:06:00,092 --> 00:06:01,694
PROTECTING AMERICAN WORKERS

00:06:01,694 --> 00:06:03,296
BEFORE HOLDING A CAMPAIGN-STYLE 

143
00:06:03,296 --> 00:06:04,430
RALLY IN DULUTH. 

144
00:06:04,430 --> 00:06:06,599
THE PRESIDENT LOST MINNESOTA TO

00:06:06,599 --> 00:06:08,401
HILLARY CLINTON IN 2016 BY 

146
00:06:08,401 --> 00:06:09,535
NEARLY 45,000 VOTES.
