1
00:00:00,312 --> 00:00:01,847
COMMENTS OF ONE OR TWO

2
00:00:01,847 --> 00:00:02,848
COMMISSIONERS COULD SHOULD BE

3
00:00:02,848 --> 00:00:04,416
TAKEN TO OVERCOME PHILLIPS

4
00:00:04,416 --> 00:00:07,786
REFUSAL TO SELL A WEDDING CAKE."

5
00:00:07,786 --> 00:00:09,588
>> Shannon: TOOK A BIG

6
00:00:09,588 --> 00:00:11,189
DECISIONS DEALING WITH TWO HOT

7
00:00:11,189 --> 00:00:12,624
BUTTON ISSUES, RELIGIOUS

8
00:00:12,624 --> 00:00:13,825
FREEDOM, AND ABORTION FOR

9
00:00:13,825 --> 00:00:15,627
UNDERAGED TEENS IN THE U.S.

10
00:00:15,627 --> 00:00:16,027
ILLEGALLY.

11
00:00:16,027 --> 00:00:17,829
LET'S TALK ABOUT THE POLITICAL

12
00:00:17,829 --> 00:00:20,632
IMPACT WITH TYLER DEATON, SENIOR

13
00:00:20,632 --> 00:00:21,833
ADVISOR OF THE AMERICAN UNITY

14
00:00:21,833 --> 00:00:23,368
FUND AND TONY PERKINS, PRESIDENT

15
00:00:23,368 --> 00:00:25,404
OF THE FAMILY RESEARCH COUNCIL.

16
00:00:25,404 --> 00:00:26,838
GENTLEMEN, WELCOME TO YOU BOTH.

17
00:00:26,838 --> 00:00:27,806
>> THANK YOU.

18
00:00:27,806 --> 00:00:28,840
>> Shannon: OBVIOUSLY, JUSTICE

19
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:30,909
KENNEDY POINTED BACK TO THOSE

20
00:00:30,909 --> 00:00:31,910
COMMENTS BY COMMISSIONER AT THE

21
00:00:31,910 --> 00:00:33,245
LOWEST LEVEL WHO WAS THE FIRST

22
00:00:33,245 --> 00:00:35,080
TO LOOK AT THIS CASE.

23
00:00:35,080 --> 00:00:36,681
LIKENING THE BACON OR DON MIKE

24
00:00:36,681 --> 00:00:37,949
BAKER'S RELIGIOUS CONVICTIONS TO

25
00:00:37,949 --> 00:00:41,620
PEOPLE WHO SUPPORTED SLAVERY OR

26
00:00:41,620 --> 00:00:44,956
TO NAZIS, THAT WAS ENOUGH FOR

27
00:00:44,956 --> 00:00:47,192
THEM TO SAY COME ON THAT BASIS

28
00:00:47,192 --> 00:00:49,161
ALONE, HE SHOULD NOT OF BEEN

29
00:00:49,161 --> 00:00:50,662
SUBJECTED TO THAT DISCRIMINATION

30
00:00:50,662 --> 00:00:51,596
AGAINST HIS RELIGIOUS

31
00:00:51,596 --> 00:00:51,930
BELIEFS.

32
00:00:51,930 --> 00:00:54,399
>> THAT ATTITUDE IS OUT OF

33
00:00:54,399 --> 00:00:56,201
BALANCE AND SINCE THEN, THAT

34
00:00:56,201 --> 00:00:57,302
COMMISSIONER IS NO LONGER ON THE

35
00:00:57,302 --> 00:00:58,236
COLORADO CIVIL RIGHTS

36
00:00:58,236 --> 00:00:58,837
COMMISSION.

37
00:00:58,837 --> 00:01:00,472
I THINK WHAT IT POINTS TO IS,

38
00:01:00,472 --> 00:01:02,074
THOSE WERE HURTFUL STATEMENTS TO

39
00:01:02,074 --> 00:01:03,975
MAKE ABOUT PEOPLE OF FAITH.

40
00:01:03,975 --> 00:01:05,811
I THINK THERE ARE A LOT OF LGBT

41
00:01:05,811 --> 00:01:07,412
AMERICANS WHO ARE ALSO HEARING

42
00:01:07,412 --> 00:01:09,247
SOMETIMES HURTFUL THINGS SAID

43
00:01:09,247 --> 00:01:10,549
ABOUT THEM, AND I THINK THAT ALL

44
00:01:10,549 --> 00:01:11,483
OF US IS POINTING TO THE NEED

45
00:01:11,483 --> 00:01:13,452
FOR US TO COME TOGETHER, COME

46
00:01:13,452 --> 00:01:15,387
AND FIND SOME SORT OF A MIDDLE

47
00:01:15,387 --> 00:01:17,389
GROUND, WHERE PEOPLE OF FAITH

48
00:01:17,389 --> 00:01:18,223
AND LGBT PEOPLE CAN BOTH BE

49
00:01:18,223 --> 00:01:21,393
RESPECTED BY THE LAWS AND CAN BE

50
00:01:21,393 --> 00:01:22,427
OUT ON THE FREE MARKETPLACE

51
00:01:22,427 --> 00:01:23,195
DOING THEIR BUSINESS AND KNOW

52
00:01:23,195 --> 00:01:24,162
THAT THEY ARE FREE TO PURSUE

53
00:01:24,162 --> 00:01:26,798
THEIR AMERICAN DREAM REGARDLESS

54
00:01:26,798 --> 00:01:27,833
OF THEIR VALUES ARE REGARDLESS

55
00:01:27,833 --> 00:01:29,768
OF WHO THEY ARE MARRIED TO.

56
00:01:29,768 --> 00:01:31,436
>> Shannon: TODAY, JUSTICE

57
00:01:31,436 --> 00:01:32,471
KENNEDY, HE ACKNOWLEDGED THAT

58
00:01:32,471 --> 00:01:33,605
THE COURTS HAVE TO DECIDE THE

59
00:01:33,605 --> 00:01:34,873
MEAT OF THIS CASE, HE SAID THERE

60
00:01:34,873 --> 00:01:36,608
HAS TO BE TOLERANCE ON BOTH

61
00:01:36,608 --> 00:01:37,342
SIDES FOR PEOPLE WITH GENUINE

62
00:01:37,342 --> 00:01:38,810
RELIGIOUS BELIEFS AND AS YOU

63
00:01:38,810 --> 00:01:41,012
SAID, FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE GAY AND

64
00:01:41,012 --> 00:01:42,347
LESBIAN, WHO WANT TO BE IN

65
00:01:42,347 --> 00:01:43,348
COMMERCE AND BUSINESS.

66
00:01:43,348 --> 00:01:44,282
HE SAID IT WILL BE A DELICATE

67
00:01:44,282 --> 00:01:46,384
QUESTION TO ANSWER.

68
00:01:46,384 --> 00:01:47,819
WE KNOW ON THURSDAY, AND A

69
00:01:47,819 --> 00:01:49,554
PRIVATE CONFERENCE, THEY WILL

70
00:01:49,554 --> 00:01:50,122
CONSIDER THE CASE FOR

71
00:01:50,122 --> 00:01:52,390
WASHINGTON'S FLORISTS, WHO

72
00:01:52,390 --> 00:01:54,359
BASICALLY HAS BEEN PUT IN RUIN

73
00:01:54,359 --> 00:01:55,994
BY WHAT SHE HAS FACED, A

74
00:01:55,994 --> 00:01:56,995
LONG-TIME CUSTOMER OF HERS CAME

75
00:01:56,995 --> 00:01:59,364
TO HER AND SAID, I WANTED TO DO

76
00:01:59,364 --> 00:02:01,800
THE FLOWERS FOR MY SAME-SEX

77
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:03,168
WEDDING, SHE DECLINED.

78
00:02:03,168 --> 00:02:03,835
THREE OTHERS, ACTUALLY.

79
00:02:03,835 --> 00:02:05,670
THE FACT THAT THEY WILL CONSIDER

80
00:02:05,670 --> 00:02:08,073
THAT CASE SAYS THAT THE COURT

81
00:02:08,073 --> 00:02:11,343
ISSUE IS NOT DECIDED.

82
00:02:11,343 --> 00:02:12,811
>> WITHOUT QUESTION.

83
00:02:12,811 --> 00:02:14,880
NOBODY SHOULD BE SURPRISED BY

84
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:15,313
THIS, SHANNON.

85
00:02:15,313 --> 00:02:19,551
THREE YEARS AGO, AND THEN A

86
00:02:19,551 --> 00:02:20,152
CASE --

87
00:02:20,152 --> 00:02:22,387
>> Shannon: WHICH LEGALIZED

88
00:02:22,387 --> 00:02:23,355
SAME-SEX MARRIAGE.

89
00:02:23,355 --> 00:02:23,822
>> RIGHT.

90
00:02:23,822 --> 00:02:25,190
JUSTICE ALITO SAID THAT THIS

91
00:02:25,190 --> 00:02:27,692
WILL LEAD TO THE VILIFICATION OF

92
00:02:27,692 --> 00:02:29,094
THOSE WHO REFUSE TO ASCEND TO

93
00:02:29,094 --> 00:02:29,794
THE NEW ORTHODOXY.

94
00:02:29,794 --> 00:02:31,096
SO WE ARE SEEING THIS.

95
00:02:31,096 --> 00:02:32,898
THIS IS EXACTLY WITH THE

96
00:02:32,898 --> 00:02:34,232
COLORADO SO-CALLED CIVIL RIGHTS

97
00:02:34,232 --> 00:02:36,568
COMMISSION DID, AND THAT WAS IN

98
00:02:36,568 --> 00:02:38,170
THE OBAMA ERA, WHEN IT WAS

99
00:02:38,170 --> 00:02:39,437
OPEN SEASON ON CHRISTIANS, AND

100
00:02:39,437 --> 00:02:40,205
TO BE GREAT IF PEOPLE WOULD GET

101
00:02:40,205 --> 00:02:42,374
ALONG BUT THAT IS NOT GOING TO

102
00:02:42,374 --> 00:02:43,175
HAPPEN BECAUSE OF A COURT

103
00:02:43,175 --> 00:02:44,209
DECISION.

104
00:02:44,209 --> 00:02:45,377
IT WILL HAPPEN BECAUSE PEOPLE

105
00:02:45,377 --> 00:02:47,379
DECIDE THAT, HEY, PEOPLE HAVE

106
00:02:47,379 --> 00:02:48,079
DIFFERENT VIEWS ON THIS, BUT

107
00:02:48,079 --> 00:02:50,549
WHAT WE ARE SEEING THESE WEDDING

108
00:02:50,549 --> 00:02:54,186
VENDORS, LIKE JACK PHILLIPS, IS

109
00:02:54,186 --> 00:02:55,587
THAT THESE ACTIVIST, LGBT

110
00:02:55,587 --> 00:02:56,855
ACTIVISTS, ARE TARGETING THEM TO

111
00:02:56,855 --> 00:02:58,256
MAKE EXAMPLES OUT OF THEM.

112
00:02:58,256 --> 00:03:00,025
AS LONG AS THAT IS OCCURRING,

113
00:03:00,025 --> 00:03:01,393
THESE THINGS WILL BE CHALLENGED,

114
00:03:01,393 --> 00:03:02,627
YOU WILL SEE PEOPLE OF FAITH

115
00:03:02,627 --> 00:03:03,762
PUSHING BACK AND IT WILL BE IN

116
00:03:03,762 --> 00:03:06,398
THE COURTS, AND YOU ARE RIGHT.

117
00:03:06,398 --> 00:03:08,300
UNDER THE ROBERTS COURT, THEY

118
00:03:08,300 --> 00:03:11,169
HAVE HAD VERY NARROW DECISIONS

119
00:03:11,169 --> 00:03:12,270
WITH LIMITED APPLICATION OF

120
00:03:12,270 --> 00:03:13,805
THEIR DECISIONS, SO THIS IS NOT

121
00:03:13,805 --> 00:03:14,406
SURPRISING.

122
00:03:14,406 --> 00:03:15,407
BUT THIS THING IS GOING TO BE

123
00:03:15,407 --> 00:03:16,274
BACK BEFORE THE COURTS AND

124
00:03:16,274 --> 00:03:18,510
YOU'RE RIGHT, IT COULD BE

125
00:03:18,510 --> 00:03:19,010
DECIDED THURSDAY.

126
00:03:19,010 --> 00:03:22,414
THEY WILL BE LOOKING AT THE

127
00:03:22,414 --> 00:03:22,981
FLORIST CASE.

128
00:03:22,981 --> 00:03:23,648
>> Shannon: SOMETHING TELLS

129
00:03:23,648 --> 00:03:25,383
ME, IF THEY VOTE YES ON THIS,

130
00:03:25,383 --> 00:03:26,251
JUSTICE KENNEDY WON'T GO

131
00:03:26,251 --> 00:03:26,618
ANYWHERE.

132
00:03:26,618 --> 00:03:27,552
I THINK HE WOULD LIKE TO STICK

133
00:03:27,552 --> 00:03:28,787
AROUND OR BE A PART OF THE

134
00:03:28,787 --> 00:03:31,056
CONSIDERATION OF A CASE IF THEY

135
00:03:31,056 --> 00:03:31,489
MOVE FORWARD.

136
00:03:31,489 --> 00:03:32,290
I WANT TO ASK YOU ALL ABOUT

137
00:03:32,290 --> 00:03:33,592
SOMETHING THAT HAS FLOWN UNDER

138
00:03:33,592 --> 00:03:33,992
THE RADAR.

139
00:03:33,992 --> 00:03:36,995
WE'VE BEEN FOLLOWING THE CASE OF

140
00:03:36,995 --> 00:03:37,996
UNDERAGE ILLEGAL WOMEN WHO COME

141
00:03:37,996 --> 00:03:40,198
ACROSS THE BORDER, HERE IN THE

142
00:03:40,198 --> 00:03:41,666
STATES, AND SEEKING AN ABORTION.

143
00:03:41,666 --> 00:03:43,168
THE ACLU AND OTHER GROUPS HAVE

144
00:03:43,168 --> 00:03:44,236
RALLIED FOR THEM TO SAY IT

145
00:03:44,236 --> 00:03:45,370
SHOULD MATTER WHERE THEY ARE,

146
00:03:45,370 --> 00:03:47,005
THEY SHOULD GET HELP WITH THESE

147
00:03:47,005 --> 00:03:48,373
ABORTIONS, WHETHER THEY ARE HERE

148
00:03:48,373 --> 00:03:49,808
ILLEGALLY OR NOT.

149
00:03:49,808 --> 00:03:50,709
TODAY, THE SUPREME COURT VACATED

150
00:03:50,709 --> 00:03:52,410
THE LOWER COURT RULING THAT

151
00:03:52,410 --> 00:03:53,178
ESSENTIALLY SAID, YES, THE

152
00:03:53,178 --> 00:03:54,846
ADMINISTRATION HAS TO HELP THEM

153
00:03:54,846 --> 00:03:55,814
WITH THAT, OR WHEN THEY ARE IN

154
00:03:55,814 --> 00:03:57,649
FEDERAL CUSTODY, IT HAS TO BE

155
00:03:57,649 --> 00:03:57,983
ALLOWED.

156
00:03:57,983 --> 00:03:59,017
BUT IT'S MOOT BECAUSE THE YOUNG

157
00:03:59,017 --> 00:04:00,418
WOMAN WHO WAS AT THE CENTER OF

158
00:04:00,418 --> 00:04:02,454
THAT CASE DID GET AN ABORTION.

159
00:04:02,454 --> 00:04:03,955
THE ACLU SAYS THEY WANT TO STOP

160
00:04:03,955 --> 00:04:05,390
FIGHTING ON THIS.

161
00:04:05,390 --> 00:04:07,792
TWO SIDES HAVE WAITED FOR THE

162
00:04:07,792 --> 00:04:08,793
DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE SAID, "WE

163
00:04:08,793 --> 00:04:12,797
ARE PLEASED WITH THE SUPREME

164
00:04:12,797 --> 00:04:14,032
COURT'S DECISION THAT SET ASIDE

165
00:04:14,032 --> 00:04:17,369
A LOWER COURT'S DECISION."

166
00:04:17,369 --> 00:04:18,103
THE SUPREME COURT AS HER.

167
00:04:18,103 --> 00:04:20,071
WE MADE CLEAR THAT THE FEDERAL

168
00:04:20,071 --> 00:04:21,539
GOVERNMENT IS NOT REQUIRED TO

169
00:04:21,539 --> 00:04:22,574
SEVILLA STATE ABORTIONS FOR

170
00:04:22,574 --> 00:04:25,644
MINOR.

171
00:04:25,644 --> 00:04:28,513
NARAL SAYS "EVERY WOMAN

172
00:04:31,116 --> 00:04:32,417
I WANT TO GET A REACTION FOR

173
00:04:32,417 --> 00:04:33,418
BOTH OF YOU.

174
00:04:33,418 --> 00:04:35,153
TYLER, I WILL START WITH YOU.

175
00:04:35,153 --> 00:04:37,389
>> THIS IS REALLY INTERESTING.

176
00:04:37,389 --> 00:04:40,258
I THINK THAT MY ORGANIZATION,

177
00:04:40,258 --> 00:04:41,593
BECAUSE WE ARE CONSERVATIVE

178
00:04:41,593 --> 00:04:42,294
GROUP THAT DOES ADVOCATE FOR

179
00:04:42,294 --> 00:04:43,728
LGBT ISSUES, I THINK THAT A LOT

180
00:04:43,728 --> 00:04:45,363
OF PEOPLE END UP WONDERING IF WE

181
00:04:45,363 --> 00:04:46,498
ARE WORKING ON OTHER SOCIAL

182
00:04:46,498 --> 00:04:47,699
ISSUES, AND HOW WE FEEL ABOUT

183
00:04:47,699 --> 00:04:49,701
THESE OTHER THINGS.

184
00:04:49,701 --> 00:04:51,169
I HAVE TO TELL YOU, THIS IS

185
00:04:51,169 --> 00:04:52,404
SOMETHING I'M NOT AN EXPERT ON.

186
00:04:52,404 --> 00:04:55,373
BUT I DO THINK THAT HERE, IT'S

187
00:04:55,373 --> 00:04:57,208
IMPORTANT TO TAKE A FULL AND

188
00:04:57,208 --> 00:04:57,942
CONSISTENT PRO-LIFE POSITION.

189
00:04:57,942 --> 00:04:59,878
IT WASN'T UNTIL THE LAST YEAR

190
00:04:59,878 --> 00:05:02,747
THAT OUR GOVERNMENT BEGAN TO

191
00:05:02,747 --> 00:05:03,448
DETAIN PREGNANT UNDOCUMENTED

192
00:05:03,448 --> 00:05:03,748
WOMEN.

193
00:05:03,748 --> 00:05:05,216
I THINK THAT AT THE CORE OF

194
00:05:05,216 --> 00:05:07,552
THIS, WE ARE DETAINING PREGNANT

195
00:05:07,552 --> 00:05:08,186
UNDOCUMENTED WOMEN.

196
00:05:08,186 --> 00:05:09,587
WE SHOULD REVERSE THAT POLICY.

197
00:05:09,587 --> 00:05:10,989
I THINK THE MOST PRO-LIFE THING

198
00:05:10,989 --> 00:05:12,123
THAT WE COULD DO RIGHT NOW AND

199
00:05:12,123 --> 00:05:14,993
THIS HAS BEEN ADVOCATED BY THE

200
00:05:14,993 --> 00:05:15,727
CATHOLIC BISHOPS, SOUTHERN

201
00:05:15,727 --> 00:05:17,362
BAPTIST CONVENTION, WE SHOULD

202
00:05:17,362 --> 00:05:18,697
NOT BE DETAINING PREGNANT WOMEN,

203
00:05:18,697 --> 00:05:19,831
AND WE WOULDN'T HAVE THIS

204
00:05:19,831 --> 00:05:20,699
PROBLEM TO BEGIN WITH.

205
00:05:20,699 --> 00:05:21,733
>> Shannon: TONY KIM A PART OF

206
00:05:21,733 --> 00:05:23,268
THE PROBLEM THAT STEMS FROM

207
00:05:23,268 --> 00:05:25,170
THESE CASES, THESE ARE

208
00:05:25,170 --> 00:05:27,806
MINORS, IN MANY CASES, THIS

209
00:05:27,806 --> 00:05:30,008
LEADS OFFICIALS WITH NO OTHER

210
00:05:30,008 --> 00:05:30,342
CHOICE.

211
00:05:30,342 --> 00:05:32,544
YOUR REACTION?

212
00:05:32,544 --> 00:05:34,979
>> FIRST OFF, I COMMEND THE

213
00:05:34,979 --> 00:05:35,680
DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE, WE'VE

214
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:38,016
BEEN WORKING WITH THEM ON THIS.

215
00:05:38,016 --> 00:05:38,583
THEY WERE WORKING VERY

216
00:05:38,583 --> 00:05:42,921
DILIGENTLY TO FIND SPONSORS FOR

217
00:05:42,921 --> 00:05:45,223
SOME OF THESE UNACCOMPANIED

218
00:05:45,223 --> 00:05:45,790
MINORS.

219
00:05:45,790 --> 00:05:46,424
THIS IS STILL AN ISSUE.

220
00:05:46,424 --> 00:05:48,593
IT'S ONGOING.

221
00:05:48,593 --> 00:05:49,894
OTHER COURTS, I THINK THERE IS

222
00:05:49,894 --> 00:05:52,297
CONCERN THAT THEY WILL BE FORCED

223
00:05:52,297 --> 00:05:53,498
TO FACILITATE THESE ABORTIONS IT

224
00:05:53,498 --> 00:05:54,566
IN OTHER CASES.

225
00:05:54,566 --> 00:05:55,333
I THINK THIS COURT DECISION IS A

226
00:05:55,333 --> 00:05:57,736
VERY GOOD ONE.

227
00:05:57,736 --> 00:05:58,336
I LOOK FOR THE JUSTICE

228
00:05:58,336 --> 00:05:59,938
DEPARTMENT TO MAKE MOST OF THIS

229
00:05:59,938 --> 00:06:01,840
BECAUSE THIS IS AN

230
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:03,742
ADMINISTRATION THAT IS VERY

231
00:06:03,742 --> 00:06:05,377
COMMITTED TO UPHOLDING THE

232
00:06:05,377 --> 00:06:06,711
SANCTITY OF HUMAN LIFE, ALL

233
00:06:06,711 --> 00:06:07,779
HUMAN LIFE, REGARDLESS OF WHAT

234
00:06:07,779 --> 00:06:09,381
SIDE OF THE BORDER, TRACKS, IT'S

235
00:06:09,381 --> 00:06:10,382
CONCEIVED ON.

236
00:06:10,382 --> 00:06:13,351
I THINK THIS IS A GOOD DECISION.

237
00:06:13,351 --> 00:06:14,986
I LOOK FORWARD TO THE DEPARTMENT

238
00:06:14,986 --> 00:06:16,421
OF JUSTICE MAKING THE MOST OF

239
00:06:16,421 --> 00:06:16,688
IT.

240
00:06:16,688 --> 00:06:18,123
>> Shannon: TONY AND TYLER,

241
00:06:18,123 --> 00:00:00,000
THANK YOU BOTH ARE A VERY
