It’s almost formulaic.
It starts with the emotional
music:
Then the text:
The message: “I was diagnosed
with pediatric cancer
when I was 14 years old.”
“Millions of people in
the developing world
walk up to six hours
every day for water.”
Then the grand finale:
the brand.
Companies continue
to use the Super Bowl platform
to promote humanitarian causes
either initiated or
supported by their brands.
It’s a type of marketing that
promotes feelings over facts.
The ads are light on product
details and heavy on emotion.
“You helped save my child’s
life and the life
of so many children.”
“So I’d like to say thank you.
Except I would like
to say it in person.”
“Can I hug you?”
And so there’s Hyundai,
a South Korean
car maker that has
decided to donate
a portion of sales
to childhood cancer research.
Stella Artois
donated $3.13
to water.org for every
limited edition chalice sold.
Are these companies aiming
for philanthropy or profits?
The average cost of a 30-second ad during the Super Bowl
was more than $5
million this year.
And that doesn’t
count the expenses
tied to making and
promoting it, like the star power.
Critics argue that if
companies really cared
they’d donate money
directly to the cause
instead of a $5 million
ad promoting it.
