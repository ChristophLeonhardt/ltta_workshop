letter dated 13th of March 2018 from the Shahadah Fair II of the permanent mission of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland to the United Nations address to the president of the Security Council s / 2018 / 218 the agenda is adopted the Security Council will now begin its consideration of item 2 of the agenda I wish to draw the attention of council members to document s 2018 to 18 the letter dated 13th of March 2018 from the Shahadah fair data fair I now give the floor to those council members who wish to make statements I give the floor to representative of the United Kingdom Thank You mr. president and thank you for arranging this urgent meeting of the Security Council today to give the United Kingdom the opportunity to update Council colleagues on our investigation into a nerve agent attack in Salisbury on Sunday the 4th of March Sergei scribble were found in the town centre slipping out of consciousness on a public bench and were taken to hospital by our emergency services where they remain in a very serious condition investigations by world leading experts at the defense Science and Technology Laboratory at Porton Down accredited by the organisation for prohibition of chemical weapons OPCW discovered that they had been exposed to a nerve agent British police officer Nick Bailey was also exposed and remains in hospital in a serious condition hundreds of British citizens have been potentially exposed to this nerve agent in what was an indiscriminate and reckless act against the United Kingdom we have deployed our military to secure and decontaminate numerous sites the police continue an exhaustive wide scale investigation through those investigations we have concluded that mr. scribble and his daughter were poisoned with a Navi shock a military-grade nerve agent of a type developed by Russia it is not a weapon which can be manufactured by non-state actors it is so dangerous that it requires the highest-grade state laboratories and expertise based on the knowledge that Russia has previously produced this agent and combined with Russia's record of conducting state-sponsored assassinations including against former intelligence officers whom they regard as legitimate targets the UK government concluded that it was highly likely that Russia was responsible for this reckless act we saw only two plausible explanations either this was a direct attack by Russia on my country or Russia had lost control of a military-grade nerve agent which they had developed we requested the Russian government to provide an explanation by the end of Tuesday the 13th of March on how this Russian produced nerve agent could have been deployed in Salisbury they provided no credible explanation which could suggest they lost control of their nerve agent mr. president we therefore have no alternative but to conclude that the Russian state was responsible for the attempted murder of mr. su cripple and his daughter and police officer Nick Bailey and for threatening the lives of other British citizens in Salisbury mr. president this was no common crime it was an unlawful use of force a violation of article 2 of the United Nations Charter the basis of the international legal order mr. president the UK is proud to have been one of the states which played an integral role in drafting the Chemical Weapons Convention a landmark piece of international law we are therefore dismayed that Russia has suggested that our response fails to me the requirements of the convention article 7 of the convention calls on state parties to implement the convention under their own legislation the United Kingdom has enacted the Chemical Weapons Act in order to fully comply with this obligation that legislation together with relevant criminal law is now guiding our investigation into this incident as the convention was designed this was an attack on UK soil under the convention we have the right to lead our response engaging the OPCW and others as appropriate on the 8th of March the UK formally notified the OPCW Technical Secretariat that a chemical attack had taken place on UK soil the Russian Federation has complained that we are not using article 9 of the Convention on the contrary on the 12th of March once it became clear to us that the United Kingdom had been attacked my foreign secretary summoned the Russian ambassador and sought an explanation from his government as article 9 is clear we have the right to do we have received no meaningful response it is therefore Russia which is failing to comply with the provisions of the Convention and this council should not fall for their attempt to muddy the waters in addition the United Kingdom has welcomed the offer of technical assistance from the director-general of the OPCW and we have invited the Technical Secretariat to independently verify our analysis we are making every effort to expedite this process mr. president that has now turned to the part of the Chemical Weapons Convention which Russia is not talking about the part which requires state parties to declare chemical weapons stockpiles and facilities which have been used at any time since 1946 to produce chemical weapons chemical weapons would be verifiably destroyed and production facilities destroyed or converted subject to approval within 10 years of entry into force of the convention Russia completed destruction of its declared stockpile in September 2017 ten years later than required by the Convention and five years beyond the single five-year extension period Russia did not declare in Navi shock agents or production facilities associated with them as it was required to do under the convention no development facilities were declared yet we know from testimony by the russian scientist vilnius ani off that navi chocks were developed as part of the soviet union's offensive chemical web or fair program and inherited by the russian federation such facilities associated with that program should have been declared under the CWC even today a Russian politician has said that Russia has destroyed the Navi chopped nerve gas mr. president from all of this we can conclude that Russia is in serious breach of the Chemical Weapons Convention through its failure to declare the Navi shock program this fact alone means you should discount any arguments you hear about the possibility of other countries having inherited this technology had Russia declared and destroyed their own program there might have been some truth to this mr. president on the 4th of March a weapon so horrific that it is banned from use in war was used in a peaceful City in my country this was a reckless act carried out by people who disregard the sanctity of human life who are indifferent to whether innocents are caught up in their attacks they either did not care that the weapon news would be traced back to them or mistakenly believed that they could cover their traces Russian officials and media channels have repeatedly threatened those they consider traitors even after the full March attack Russia has a history of state-sponsored assassinations including that of Alexander Litvinenko poisoned by radioactive materials in my country a decade ago Russia has a history of interfering in other countries whether the botched coup in Montenegro repeated cyber attacks on other states or seeking to influence others democratic processes Russia has a history of flouting international law most egregiously in Crimea eastern Ukraine and Georgia Russia shows disregard for civilian life we all remember flight mh17 shot down by Russian proxies supplied with Russian weapons and Russia has shown in its repeated protection of Assad's chemical weapons use that it has different standards when it comes to the use of these terrible substances we have not jumped to conclusions we have carried out a thorough careful investigation which continues we are asking the OPCW to independently verify the nerve agent used we have offered Russia the chance to explain but Russia has refused we have therefore concluded that the Russian state was involved and we have taken certain measures in response in taking these measures we have been clear that we have no disagreement with the people of Russia who have been responsible for so many great achievements throughout history it is the reckless acts of their government that we oppose mr. president we are grateful for the support of so many countries around the world we will come back to this council as the investigations make more progress and continue to keep you informed we have already heard the attacks and threats that Russia has made over the past few days we know that there will be more to come this is how Russia has acted in every other case where it has been caught flouting international law denial distraction and threats it is what Russia does but we will not let such threats deter us we will not weaken our resolve we will stand firm confident in our democracy our rule of law and the freedom of our people we will stand by the values which are shared by the overwhelming majority of those in this council in this United Nations and we ask you today to stand by us Thank You mr. president I thank the representative of the United Kingdom for his statement I now give the floor to the representative of the United States Thank You mr. president and I thank my British colleagues for calling this important meeting we're here today to discuss the use of a chemical weapon by one council member in the territory of another council member let me make one thing clear from the very beginning the United States stands in absolute solidarity with Great Britain the United States believes that Russia is responsible for the attack on two people in the United Kingdom using a military-grade nerve agent dozens of civilians and first responders were also exposed police officer Nick Bailey was the first to arrive on the scene and remains hospitalized in serious condition our thoughts and prayers go out to the victims of this atrocious crime no two nations enjoy a stronger bond than that of the United States and the United Kingdom ours is truly a special relationship when our friends in Great Britain faced a challenge the United States will always be there for them always alone Russia's crime is worthy of this Council's action but this is not an isolated incident the assassination attempt in Salisbury is part of an alarming increase in the use of chemical weapons last year the North Korean regime used the nerve agent VX to publicly assassinate Kim Jong Un's brother in a Malaysian airport in Syria the Assad regime continues to kill its own people with chemical weapons years after this council passed resolution 2118 to remove the threat from Syria's chemical weapons program when the Security Council created a mechanism to investigate chemical weapons attacks that mechanism was targeted when it began to shine a spotlight on Assad's role in killing his own people a growing concern in all of this dangerous and destabilizing activity is Russia Russia failed to ensure Syria destroyed its chemical weapons program Russia killed the joint investigative mechanism when it found Assad liable for chemical attacks Russia used its veto to shield aside five times last year it has also provided cover for Syria in The Hague at the organization for the prohibition of chemical weapons the Russians complained recently that we criticize them too much if the Russian government stopped using chemical weapons to assassinate its enemies and if the Russian government stopped helping its Syrian allies to use chemical weapons to kill Syrian children and if Russia cooperated with the organization for the prohibition of chemical weapons by turning over all information related to this nerve agent we would stop talking about them we take no pleasure and having to constantly criticize Russia but we need Russia to stop giving us so many reasons to do so Russia must fully cooperate with the UK's investigation and come clean about its own chemical weapons program Russia is a permanent member of the Security Council it is entrusted in the United Nations Charter with upholding international peace and security it must account for its actions if we don't take immediate concrete measures to address this now Salisbury will not be the last place we see chemical weapons used they could be used here in New York or in cities or of any country that sits on this council this is a defining moment time and time again Member States say they oppose the use of chemical weapons under any circumstance now one member stands accused of using chemical weapons on the sovereign soil of another member the credibility of this council will not survive if we fail to hold accountable thank you I think the representative of the United States for his statement I now give the floor

Sweden on the event which took place in Salisbury thank you I thank the representative of God device for his statement I now give the floor to the representative of Kazakhstan mr. president Kurdistan is known for its clear and consistent position of an uncompromising opponent of all types of weapons of mass destruction including chemical weapons we condemn any use of weapons of mass destruction as immoral inhuman and contrary to the principles of humanity we express our deep concern over the tragic incident was the possible use of chemical chemical warfare agent of the territory of the United Kingdom it is impermissible to use the chemical agents against anyone and anywhere at the same time since it is a very politically sensitive issue we should be extremely cautious and careful enjoying hastily conclusions without credible and convincing facts on the ground the incident should be carefully investigated and any conclusions should be substantiated we believe that any international response to this incident should be considered only after the exhaustive transparent objective and impartial investigation in accordance with the existing norms of international law primarily on the basis of the provisions of the Convention on the prohibition of chemical weapons we hope that two parties will be able to resolve all the contradictions and disputes between them by diplomatic means

you very much I thank the representative of Bolivia for his statement and I now give the floor to the representative of Ethiopia Thank You mr. president we have been following the news about the nerve agent attacked in Salisbury UK we express our sympathy for and solidarity with the families of the victims as well as with the people in government of the United Kingdom we have noted the letter by the prime minister of the youtubes addressed the secretary-general on the incident circulated yesterday and we appreciate the UK delegation for the briefing that we have received while ago our position on the use of chemical weapons is well known respond to condemn any use of chemical weapons by any state for non-state actor use of chemicals and weapons is unacceptable and it constitutes a serious violation under international rule this said we hope the necessary independent investigation will be conducted and also waited from the Sally Sainsbury incident including by undertaking presentation and exchange of information on the basis of available provisions for the Chemical Weapons Convention with a view to bringing those responsible to justice we believe cooperation between Russia and the UK in good faith is very critical to ensure that this issue will not get out of hand and undermine even further relations between the two countries in this regard we are hopeful and trust that given the very justified concern of the UK will be addressed in a way that in the UK on this incident Thank You mr. president opening this issue into the genuine experts on chemical the new begins in the hague and those experts will not be convinced they are afraid of having a real topic the old shows record your sentence the initiators of this meeting completely different we do not we do not allow to in that language used non transparent to ask whether this applies to the UN as well and they are trying to influence the public which is very easy to influence because that's what people do to of the convention which they're provided over the allegedly found Russian trace in this truth is not something that we do lightly until now we have not seen anything besides stating that this is highly likely and authorities have not destroyed their name in this in this including in the US and the UK in the West are classified and reflected in more than 200 open sources NATO countries and we do have reference to that and we stand ready to provide you with them vacation including intensive research including the opinion of a professional chemist and not any other kind the standard it needs to be compared to the standard means in other words they have a collection is the most important that means that they have no samples of this and they have the formula for this and they're capable of manufacturing that mr. president very very special is incredible things are happening due process but replacing the result of innocence with a presumption of guilt is taking place is now being transferred into international relations what's your new possible today ambassador Hey as an experienced chemist and an expert in Spain talked today about the crimes committed by Russia in order to determine who is a guilty party no investigation is needed stated that this is highly likely but even in this you have exceeded your reliable Secutor Wyszynski saw their confession was the best kind of proof using what is the best kind of proof is suspicion was on you three boots that you must declare it is no longer necessary to show to the council test tubes with unknown white substance which contains an egregious attitude towards towards a sovereign state we are witnessing the same when it comes to Syria he purchased one little sweet liquor massive the purchase of a suggestion now Russia is is being pushed towards the the number of those who violate in illegal attacks on independent states in including using unsubstantiated proof Yugoslavia Yugoslavia Iraq Libya this led to numerous suffering against among users targeted assassinations by listening referring from you invectives against us is something that is odd because lately and when there is no proof behind them it's all the more odd Judas prevents the in general there is a principle we warn them Bono use press in other words look for those whose benefit this is being done with Luigi well what do you think we're that's benefits on the and the world a number of countries by the principle of from this incident and accusing Russia of it for the attempt and given over to the British was no longer for any kind of threat to my country he is a perfect victim justify any unbelievable lie any kind of dirt or any kind of black PR tarnishing Russia provocation before a certain events could happen try to tarnish Russia stooping to any low one blue school classic our pool of Conan Conan Doyle the British classic lastly are no receive for fame for his country and very popular in Russia and he has a hapless character in in those stories Inspector Lestrade from Scotland Yard it doesn't have the method of deduction he is not particularly smart you know would you be through special crowd for the extraordinary detective powers of Sherlock Holmes one based in the country latches on something that is all the time and is an imperative to be overturned by Sherlock Holmes who always finds what is behind the crime and what is the motive for it no question my team of course not trying to say that those who work in Scotland Yard today are not professional gardeners from that why do you think that we could all stand to benefit from having a Sherlock Holmes with us today with egregious superficial and unsupported organizations which have far-reaching consequences ultimatums and threats of bernal supported and accusations give up with in colonial habits and get back to the to to the area which is governed by law situations similar letter by Teresa may normally would be done using instruments once again London is something that we consider a attention to and we expect investigation is for joint investigations since you are saying that they are Russian in origin difficult at Yumi's this is not optional this is a mandatory requirement under the we have nothing to fear we have nothing to hide we can we'll turn to the governing body of the OPCW realized way of settling the issue accused of violating the convention without any justification well there is no other way with specialists from from other m in specialist in this area is something that we cannot avoid to an open and constructive cooperation within the framework of conventions are mentioned and we hope and expect that all members of the council will support this thank you I think the representative of the Russian Federation for his statement I shall now make a statement in my capacity as representative of the game of the Netherlands the Kingdom of the Netherlands supports remarks by the representative of the United Kingdom who brought to our attention the urgent met before us today I would like to underline three points first solidarity with the United Kingdom second concern of the use of a chemical weapon and third the need for accountability my first point solidarity until the beginning of this month it was hard to imagine a more peaceful place in the world in Salisbury a quiet historic town among the rolling hills of southern hang England then the peace was brutally disturbed a man and his daughter were poisoned with the use of a nerve agent United Kingdom was shocked the world was shocked in the Kingdom of the Netherlands was shocked on behalf of my government our Minister of Foreign Affairs step block has strongly condemned the attack and has expressed a solidarity with the United Kingdom people in the Netherlands feel free Yuliya and Sergei screep are and we hope for the recovery of all the victims we fully understand the outrage of the UK authorities we also understand why this new incident is particularly painful for the people of the United Kingdom who still have vivid memories of the brutal murder of missile it Venango with the use of radioactive polonium in the heart of London now the United Kingdom finds itself confront confronted with a new and different case of which the full details are yet to be determined but one thing is beyond doubt already the no state can or should accept attacks taking place on a sovereign territory the United Kingdom can count on the full solidarity of the Kingdom of the Netherlands my second point in the use of a chemical weapon we express a grave concern of the type of weapon that was used in this attack the military-grade nerve agent a substance that no regular criminal could easily get his hands on this is the first time since the end of the Second World War that a nerve agent has been used in Europe the recklessness of this act is beyond words this nerve agent was used in a public space with many unsuspecting civilians around it could have had even more horrible effects than has been the case and I would also like to reiterate that any use of chemical weapons is abhorrent ghena muffin Ellen's regards this as a threat to international peace and security therefore it should be a matter of concern for this council and we commend the United Kingdom for bringing it to our attention after the recent chemical weapons attacks in Syria the attack in the UK is another warning to the world that we must step up our vigilance to prevent the use of these weapons of mass destruction and we underline the important role of the OPCW in The Hague in this regard this brings me to my third and final point accountability there can be no impunity for this crime our government stated that the Kingdom of the Netherlands fully supports the UK in its quest for the truth and we call on all other countries to do so as well UK authorities had urged the Russian Federation to provide answers to the questions that they have by yesterday we can understand why after Russia's failure to do so Prime Minister may announced bilateral measures earlier today we say we see no reason for Russia to continue to refuse the UK's request nor do we see any legitimate reason why anyone should try to delay sidetrack second-guess or discredit the investigation carried out by the UK authorities the international community cannot shrug its shoulders of this crime as if nothing happened the United Nations this council and all Member States should cooperate with the United Kingdom as it further investigates this gruesome act the perpetrators should be brought to justice I will now resume my function as president of the Council the representative of the United Kingdom has asked for the floor to make a further statement before Pease Thank You mr. president my Russian colleague asked some questions and I thought I would answer he asked why did we come to the United Nations Security Council isn't the Security Council where countries come when there's been a threat to international peace and security when there has been an unlawful attack on them he asked if we'll work with Russia here of course we will work with Russia here we believe in the United Nations and its Security Council we believe in the international rules-based system we want this council to work together to uphold international peace and security and to resolve conflict together of course we will work with Russia to achieve those aims here in this council I set out in detail how the conventional chemical weapons works and in particular its article 9 council members have heard from me you've heard from the Russian colleague I won't go into it in great detail again I will simply say that under article 9 we have asked Russia for an explanation Russia's response was to say they considered our request to be null and void we have also asked the OPCW to support us with an independent verification of our analysis the Russian colleague talked about samples but again this is a misunderstanding of the convention there are no preventive provisions in the convention which require the UK to share samples collected as part of a criminal investigation the Chemical Weapons Convention does provide inspected State Parties with a right to have duplicate copies of samples taken for the purposes of an inspection but Russia is not an inspected state party in this case we're asked why we were so keen to ask for a quick answer that comes from our past experience one of the key tactics in the Russian playbook is to delay delay delay distract to Meyer in procedural delay and we know that of course from the sad tragic Litvinenko case in 2006 we waited for months in the hope that Russia would cooperate with our requests to extradite and investigate the known suspects we waited in vain we will not make the same mistake again and finally my Russian colleague quotes fiction let me quote the Russian president when we think about who benefits in 2010 he said quote traitors will kick the bucket believe me those other folks betrayed their friends their brothers in arms whatever they got in exchange for those 30 pieces of silver they were given they will choke on them and once again in which we will not respond to unsubstantiated allegations which were launched against us before any kind of answer received from us we are ready to cooperate with the British government in order to investigate unfortunately incidentally I do not think that anything that I said earlier is in contradiction with this statement of mine right now thank you I thank the representative of the Russian Federation for his statement there are no more names inscribed on the list of speakers the meeting is adjourned
