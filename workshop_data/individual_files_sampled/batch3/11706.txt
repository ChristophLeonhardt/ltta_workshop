it's early morning but the office of this human rights group in Grozny is packed with women all desperate to find out any news about their loved ones many have come here from other regions of Russia's North Caucasus in almost all cases their relatives left Russia to join ISIL in Syria often taking their young children with them these women are United and their quest to have one simple question answered are their family members still alive there are over 600 women and children reported missing at this Human Rights office alone and these are just some of the photos that their family members have left in a bit to locate them now every picture has the name date of birth and some general information on the back now this is a four year old sumaya and this child has left Russia when he was less than a year but there so many more of them but ISA doesn't miss a single meeting held at the office she says she has already accepted that she will never see her only son again but she just hopes that her grandchildren are still alive she brought pictures of her son's wife Miriam one taken before she went to Syria and another when she was over there with her son let ISA has never even seen her grandchildren in person both of them were born in Syria and communication was lost long ago so much so that she doesn't even know the name of her granddaughter we all hope that it will be okay that somehow it will all be okay I just feel so sorry for the children it's so difficult when you don't know where exactly you I hadn't heard anything from my daughter-in-law in the past eight months day and night I cried I will turn fixes this year it is so difficult I don't think I can last much longer bangs arena tries to spend almost all her free time at this office coming here after work she listens to the women's stories fills out forms and registers the newcomers her own personal tragedy brought her here to this place three years ago her brother left home and never returned his phone was last tracked in Turkey but not a trace since almost three years of silence it is very difficult for me now because we were so close since we were kids always together went to school together aboard the University together we work together he was always around I guess after he left I feel like part of me is gone I don't live a normal life now I just exist while serena still believes that one day she will see her brother alive she has dedicated her life to helping others find their families 21 russian women are currently in prison in iraq all of them were sentenced to life behind bars but they are there in prison with their children so now we are trying to bring back these children it is going to be such a joy it's just one child returns if I help these children maybe this might somehow help me bring my brother back home for job garage her surge has come to its conclusion but there was a no fairytale ending she found out that her older sister Aida is among a group of Russian women convicted and sentenced to life in prison in Iraq for joining and supporting ISIL she is in jail with her 12 year old daughter so while Jeff got out knows she will probably never see her sister again she is doing everything possible to get her niece back home and give her the childhood she's so clearly lost Jeff guard says that she still can't fully come to terms with her sister's decision she's on the new scallop a toaster I don't think she was looking for her butts alive there we were built in your house together our brothers gave us land we had so many plans we planted trees they arose it we wanted to do so much you had so much plans for the future and suddenly this happened all these stories are tragically familiar had the Sarat Eva who leads the search for missing people says that the real number of families affected is catastrophic she says their database comprises over 2,000 people whispers I feel irritated when I hear people say you're saving terrorists I'm deeply disturbed by that what is this child's fault what's the fault of these children only the fact that their parents took them there and they became victims of this war when you start to deal with this problem you understand that these are human lives we're talking about and they are all our citizens it's easy to just ignore these people there are only two official employees working at the surface the others are volunteers that help when there is time had a says there is not enough manpower to deal with the vast amount of people affected and every second counts we can't afford to lose time every minute cost the lives of one or two children since efforts began to reunite families nine planes have arrived back in Russia carrying a little over a hundred people just a fraction of the thousands transits and the war-torn region might in equation of arty reporting from Russia's Republic of Chechnya earlier this week we had the first two episodes of that series about two Russian
