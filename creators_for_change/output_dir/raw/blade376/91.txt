00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,890
hey<font color="#E5E5E5"> everyone I've done quite a few</font>

2
00:00:01,890 --> 00:00:03,840
videos in the past about mainstream

3
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:05,910
media but in this video I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to cut</font>

4
00:00:05,910 --> 00:00:08,760
straight to the chase I understand there

5
00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:10,800
are a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> people out there who are</font>

6
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:12,420
very overwhelmed by<font color="#CCCCCC"> the amount of</font>

7
00:00:12,420 --> 00:00:15,929
information that is available online you

8
00:00:15,929 --> 00:00:17,520
know there's that question of which

9
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:19,980
sources are reliable which news networks

10
00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:24,359
do you trust so I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to give an</font>

11
00:00:24,359 --> 00:00:27,320
example which I feel will really explain

12
00:00:27,320 --> 00:00:30,359
well my ethos of becoming your own

13
00:00:30,359 --> 00:00:32,369
journalist let's take three countries

14
00:00:32,369 --> 00:00:34,800
and three news networks that exist

15
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:39,629
within them so the BBC which is in the

16
00:00:39,629 --> 00:00:43,260
UK CNN which is in the US and Russia

17
00:00:43,260 --> 00:00:45,390
today which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is in yes you guessed it</font>

18
00:00:45,390 --> 00:00:48,660
Russia who would<font color="#E5E5E5"> have thought there</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font>

19
00:00:48,660 --> 00:00:49,829
a lot of people<font color="#CCCCCC"> that wouldn't trust</font>

20
00:00:49,829 --> 00:00:53,550
these news networks because of agendas

21
00:00:53,550 --> 00:00:55,199
that they may<font color="#E5E5E5"> have whether it's to do</font>

22
00:00:55,199 --> 00:00:57,180
with the funding or the countries they

23
00:00:57,180 --> 00:00:59,489
are a part<font color="#E5E5E5"> of Russia today has ties with</font>

24
00:00:59,489 --> 00:01:04,409
<font color="#CCCCCC">the Kremlin in Russia BBC has ties with</font>

25
00:01:04,409 --> 00:01:06,900
the British government and CNN is a part

26
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:10,320
of America and possibly has ties<font color="#CCCCCC"> within</font>

27
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:14,220
the American<font color="#CCCCCC"> government but for me it's</font>

28
00:01:14,220 --> 00:01:16,380
not<font color="#CCCCCC"> a question about who is telling the</font>

29
00:01:16,380 --> 00:01:19,710
<font color="#CCCCCC">truth whenever you're looking at any</font>

30
00:01:19,710 --> 00:01:23,040
news network or information source it's

31
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:26,460
about what truths exist because if you

32
00:01:26,460 --> 00:01:28,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">straight away just tarnish them with</font>

33
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:31,200
it's all lies you may actually be

34
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:34,290
turning down decent information and with

35
00:01:34,290 --> 00:01:37,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">these three news networks let's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font>

36
00:01:37,530 --> 00:01:40,049
think about<font color="#CCCCCC"> how they would act Russia</font>

37
00:01:40,049 --> 00:01:43,470
today would probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> be more willing to</font>

38
00:01:43,470 --> 00:01:45,450
criticize stuff happening in the US and

39
00:01:45,450 --> 00:01:47,820
in the UK than it would in its own

40
00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:50,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">country same with BBC more willing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

41
00:01:50,850 --> 00:01:53,159
criticize the<font color="#CCCCCC"> US although that's</font>

42
00:01:53,159 --> 00:01:55,890
questionable and<font color="#E5E5E5"> Russia as opposed to</font>

43
00:01:55,890 --> 00:01:58,770
the UK and with America morning to

44
00:01:58,770 --> 00:02:02,070
question the UK and Russia then its own

45
00:02:02,070 --> 00:02:05,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">country</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> but that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> doesn't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> mean that you</font>

46
00:02:05,490 --> 00:02:08,399
should just<font color="#E5E5E5"> write them off because if I</font>

47
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:09,810
was to do it as a diagram it would be a

48
00:02:09,810 --> 00:02:13,130
circle like an<font color="#CCCCCC"> information war zone</font>

49
00:02:13,130 --> 00:02:14,030
what you do is you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have all this</font>

50
00:02:14,030 --> 00:02:16,700
crossfire you know all these different

51
00:02:16,700 --> 00:02:18,680
news networks you know targeting

52
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:20,360
pointing the finger at each other and

53
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:23,990
actually if you pick the shrapnel if we

54
00:02:23,990 --> 00:02:26,480
use that metaphor the information

55
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:29,320
shrapnel off the ground in that circle

56
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:32,150
you will<font color="#E5E5E5"> find</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that truth lies somewhere</font>

57
00:02:32,150 --> 00:02:34,610
in the middle and I<font color="#E5E5E5"> just hope that</font>

58
00:02:34,610 --> 00:02:36,650
really makes sense because I know a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot</font>

59
00:02:36,650 --> 00:02:38,300
of people that write off news networks

60
00:02:38,300 --> 00:02:41,360
even Fox News I will sometimes see stuff

61
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:43,160
on fox news I won't completely write it

62
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:45,470
off but I will look at it and go right

63
00:02:45,470 --> 00:02:47,870
that's what they're saying by also know

64
00:02:47,870 --> 00:02:50,840
what<font color="#E5E5E5"> their agendas and political stances</font>

65
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:53,120
are usually you know so you<font color="#E5E5E5"> look at the</font>

66
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:55,160
information and actually the background

67
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:57,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">of where is coming from and that's why I</font>

68
00:02:57,470 --> 00:03:00,440
say<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's not about who is telling the</font>

69
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:02,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">truth although it is partly that but</font>

70
00:03:02,630 --> 00:03:05,720
which truths are they telling we are

71
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:08,720
living in an information war zone right

72
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:10,910
now corporations trying to<font color="#E5E5E5"> influence the</font>

73
00:03:10,910 --> 00:03:13,610
media to influence people especially

74
00:03:13,610 --> 00:03:15,410
with the military<font color="#E5E5E5"> the military</font>

75
00:03:15,410 --> 00:03:17,480
industrial complex is going on in the

76
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:19,550
<font color="#CCCCCC">world and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> also we've got government's</font>

77
00:03:19,550 --> 00:03:21,350
trying to censor the internet and

78
00:03:21,350 --> 00:03:23,780
because they're very worried about<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

79
00:03:23,780 --> 00:03:25,520
free-flowing of information<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

80
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:29,870
transparency so<font color="#E5E5E5"> hopefully that made</font>

81
00:03:29,870 --> 00:03:32,660
sense and I'd be interested to hear your

82
00:03:32,660 --> 00:03:34,970
thoughts<font color="#E5E5E5"> on how you deal with mainstream</font>

83
00:03:34,970 --> 00:03:37,550
media thank you and a days till<font color="#E5E5E5"> next</font>

84
00:03:37,550 --> 00:03:39,670
time

85
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:48,830
we just have to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be realistic all news</font>

86
00:03:48,830 --> 00:03:51,620
networks have an agenda even the BBC

87
00:03:51,620 --> 00:03:53,720
which claims<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be impartial has an</font>

88
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:55,520
agenda there has to be<font color="#CCCCCC"> some who calls</font>

89
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:58,100
the shots on what to report and what not

90
00:03:58,100 --> 00:04:00,500
to report and by becoming our own

91
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:03,890
journalist we can be smarter than<font color="#E5E5E5"> them</font>

92
00:04:03,890 --> 00:04:06,950
and I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's why we live</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in very</font>

93
00:04:06,950 --> 00:04:10,430
exciting times people are wising up to

94
00:04:10,430 --> 00:04:13,900
the traditional ways and realizing that

95
00:04:13,900 --> 00:00:00,000
truth is what's important
