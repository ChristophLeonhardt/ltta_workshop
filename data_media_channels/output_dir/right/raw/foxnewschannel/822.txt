1
00:00:01,567 --> 00:00:02,869
Champion.

2
00:00:11,477 --> 00:00:12,178
>> Sandra: WE HAVE A LOT MORE

3
00:00:12,178 --> 00:00:13,746
TO DO AND WE CAN'T RISK LOSING

4
00:00:13,746 --> 00:00:14,947
OUT ON THESE MIDTERMS SO

5
00:00:14,947 --> 00:00:17,049
COMPLACENCY WILL BE OUR ENEMY,

6
00:00:17,049 --> 00:00:19,385
AND ANYONE WHO DOESN'T EMBRACE

7
00:00:19,385 --> 00:00:20,153
THE TRUMP AGENDA AND RECOGNIZED

8
00:00:20,153 --> 00:00:22,955
THE ISSUES THAT PROPELLED US TO

9
00:00:22,955 --> 00:00:24,190
VICTORY IN THE WHITE HOUSE IS

10
00:00:24,190 --> 00:00:29,128
GOING TO BE MAKING A MISTAKE.

11
00:00:29,128 --> 00:00:30,963
>> Sandra: THAT WAS RONNA

12
00:00:30,963 --> 00:00:32,665
McDANIEL, ON OUR SISTER

13
00:00:32,665 --> 00:00:34,167
NETWORK, FOX BUSINESS.

14
00:00:34,167 --> 00:00:35,768
LAST WEEK THOSE COMMENTS SENT

15
00:00:35,768 --> 00:00:38,571
OFF A THEORY OF CRITICISM AND

16
00:00:38,571 --> 00:00:40,139
COME UP HERE TO EXCLUSIVELY

17
00:00:40,139 --> 00:00:43,142
EXPLAIN THOSE WORDS IS RONNA

18
00:00:43,142 --> 00:00:43,709
McDANIEL, CHAIR OF THE

19
00:00:43,709 --> 00:00:46,412
REPUBLICAN NATIONAL COMMITTEE.

20
00:00:46,412 --> 00:00:47,146
GOOD EVENING TIO.

21
00:00:47,146 --> 00:00:49,615
>> Ronna: GOOD EVENING, GREAT

22
00:00:49,615 --> 00:00:52,652
TO BE HERE.

23
00:00:52,652 --> 00:01:00,526
AND, IF YOU COULD CLARIFY, AND

24
00:01:00,526 --> 00:01:01,227
IT'S PROBABLY THE LEAST

25
00:01:01,227 --> 00:01:02,628
THREATENING PERSON YOU ARE GOING

26
00:01:02,628 --> 00:01:04,197
TO FIND BUT, IT'S SOMETHING I'M

27
00:01:04,197 --> 00:01:05,698
SEEING AND HEARING AS I TRAVEL

28
00:01:05,698 --> 00:01:08,134
AROUND THE COUNTRY.

29
00:01:08,134 --> 00:01:11,571
I WANT TO SEE OUR CANDIDATES

30
00:01:11,571 --> 00:01:13,573
SUPPORTING OUR PRESIDENT BECAUSE

31
00:01:13,573 --> 00:01:14,240
OUR PRESIDENT SUPPORTS US.

32
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:17,376
HE'S HELPED USHER IN 3 MILLION

33
00:01:17,376 --> 00:01:19,545
NEW JOBS, RECORD UNEMPLOYMENT.

34
00:01:19,545 --> 00:01:22,348
ISIS IS ON THE RUN, AND YOU ARE

35
00:01:22,348 --> 00:01:23,549
SEEING OUR ECONOMY BOOMING.

36
00:01:23,549 --> 00:01:25,985
THAT'S WHY THEY VOTED TO PUT HIM

37
00:01:25,985 --> 00:01:27,253
IN OFFICE AND THAT'S WHY THEY

38
00:01:27,253 --> 00:01:28,988
WANT TO SEE HIM KEEP THESE

39
00:01:28,988 --> 00:01:31,390
MAJORITIES AND HAVE CANDIDATES

40
00:01:31,390 --> 00:01:32,358
THAT ARE SUPPORTING THE AGENDA.

41
00:01:32,358 --> 00:01:34,393
>> Sandra: IT SO IT IS THAT

42
00:01:34,393 --> 00:01:36,195
THE WINNING STRATEGY HEADING

43
00:01:36,195 --> 00:01:38,164
INTO NOVEMBER TO EMBRACE THE

44
00:01:38,164 --> 00:01:40,700
PRESIDENT AND HIS POLICIES?

45
00:01:40,700 --> 00:01:45,137
>> AND, TO EMBRACE THE POLICIES.

46
00:01:45,137 --> 00:01:49,141
GOOD THINGS ARE HAPPENING IN

47
00:01:49,141 --> 00:01:49,742
THIS COUNTRY.

48
00:01:49,742 --> 00:01:51,344
WE HAVE MORE PEOPLE ENTERING THE

49
00:01:51,344 --> 00:01:53,613
WORKFORCE AND VETERANS ARE BEING

50
00:01:53,613 --> 00:01:54,747
TAKEN CARE OF.

51
00:01:54,747 --> 00:01:55,948
LOTS TO RUN ON FOUR REPUBLICANS

52
00:01:55,948 --> 00:02:00,186
AND THESE ARE THINGS THAT

53
00:02:00,186 --> 00:02:01,354
PROPELLED DONALD TRUMP.

54
00:02:01,354 --> 00:02:03,356
WE ARE TALKING ABOUT ISSUES THAT

55
00:02:03,356 --> 00:02:03,990
ARE REALLY IMPORTANT TO

56
00:02:03,990 --> 00:02:06,926
AMERICANS AND EVERY REPUBLICAN

57
00:02:06,926 --> 00:02:07,693
SHOULD EMBRACE THAT BECAUSE

58
00:02:07,693 --> 00:02:08,761
THAT'S HOW WE WILL WIN AND KEEP

59
00:02:08,761 --> 00:02:11,163
THE MAJORITY.

60
00:02:11,163 --> 00:02:13,032
>> Sandra: IT SEEMS SOME STILL

61
00:02:13,032 --> 00:02:14,800
ON THE LEFT, DEMOCRATS, ARE

62
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:19,505
CHOOSING THAT ANTI-       ANTI-R

63
00:02:19,505 --> 00:02:19,539
CHOOSING THAT ANTI-       ANTI-M

64
00:02:19,539 --> 00:02:20,640
CHOOSING THAT ANTI-       ANTI-P

65
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:20,673
CHOOSING THAT ANTI-       ANTI-M

66
00:02:20,673 --> 00:02:20,706
CHOOSING THAT ANTI-       ANTI-S

67
00:02:20,706 --> 00:02:20,740
CHOOSING THAT ANTI-       ANTI-A

68
00:02:20,740 --> 00:02:21,140
CHOOSING THAT ANTI-       ANTI-E

69
00:02:21,140 --> 00:02:21,807
CHOOSING THAT ANTI-       ANTI-

70
00:02:21,807 --> 00:02:23,543
MESSAGE.

71
00:02:23,543 --> 00:02:25,945
HE ALSO HAPPENS TO BE

72
00:02:25,945 --> 00:02:27,113
GEORGE W. BUSH'S FORMER ETHICS

73
00:02:27,113 --> 00:02:27,547
LAWYER.

74
00:02:27,547 --> 00:02:29,782
HE HAS PUT TOGETHER THIS AD

75
00:02:29,782 --> 00:02:32,285
DEPICTING TRUMP AS A DUMPSTER

76
00:02:32,285 --> 00:02:32,985
FIRE.

77
00:02:32,985 --> 00:02:33,553
WATCH THIS.

78
00:02:33,553 --> 00:02:35,688
>> SOME PEOPLE SEE A DUMPSTER

79
00:02:35,688 --> 00:02:37,023
FIRE AND DO NOTHING BUT WATCH

80
00:02:37,023 --> 00:02:38,391
THE SPECTACLE.

81
00:02:38,391 --> 00:02:39,725
SOME ARE TOO SCARED TO FACE THE

82
00:02:39,725 --> 00:02:41,193
DANGER OR THEY THINK IT WILL

83
00:02:41,193 --> 00:02:45,031
BENEFIT THEM IF THEY LET IT KEEP

84
00:02:45,031 --> 00:02:46,198
ON GOING.

85
00:02:46,198 --> 00:02:51,237
OTHERS SHRUG AND SAY, ALL THIS

86
00:02:51,370 --> 00:02:52,572
FAKE NEWS.

87
00:02:52,572 --> 00:02:57,610
THERE IS AN INFERNO RAGING IN

88
00:02:57,610 --> 00:03:01,948
WASHINGTON.

89
00:03:01,948 --> 00:03:08,120
WE WOULD KNOW HOW TO PUT OUT A

90
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:10,156
FIRE.

91
00:03:10,156 --> 00:03:12,158
>> Ronna: THEY HAVE FOCUSED ON

92
00:03:12,158 --> 00:03:13,759
THIS REALIST AND STAND UP TO THE

93
00:03:13,759 --> 00:03:14,560
PRESIDENT.

94
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:16,028
THEY ARE RESISTING BETTER PAY,

95
00:03:16,028 --> 00:03:17,330
AND A STRONGER ECONOMY, SO MANY

96
00:03:17,330 --> 00:03:19,765
GOOD THINGS OR HAVE BEEN AT THIS

97
00:03:19,765 --> 00:03:21,267
COUNTRY, THE DEMOCRATS ARE

98
00:03:21,267 --> 00:03:22,768
REFUSING TO ACKNOWLEDGE IT.

99
00:03:22,768 --> 00:03:24,470
THEY SHOULD BE EMBRACING THESE

100
00:03:24,470 --> 00:03:24,804
THINGS.

101
00:03:24,804 --> 00:03:27,573
SO ARE YOU GOING TO VOTE FOR THE

102
00:03:27,573 --> 00:03:29,208
PARTY OF NO, RESIST AND OBSTRUCT

103
00:03:29,208 --> 00:03:31,410
OR ARE YOU GOING TO GO TO THE

104
00:03:31,410 --> 00:03:32,678
DEPARTMENT THAT HAS ACTUALLY

105
00:03:32,678 --> 00:03:35,982
DONE THINGS FOR THIS COUNTRY?

106
00:03:35,982 --> 00:03:36,749
WE HAVE SEEN REPUBLICANS TURNING

107
00:03:36,749 --> 00:03:41,354
OUT IN HIGHER NUMBERS AND

108
00:03:41,354 --> 00:03:45,257
DEMOCRATS ON THESE VARIOUS

109
00:03:45,257 --> 00:03:46,325
CURRENT POLICIES IN OHIO AND

110
00:03:46,325 --> 00:03:46,759
NORTH DAKOTA.

111
00:03:46,759 --> 00:03:47,560
BUT BEYOND THAT WE ARE

112
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:49,061
DELIVERING AND MAKING PEOPLE'S

113
00:03:49,061 --> 00:03:51,998
LIVES BETTER.

114
00:03:51,998 --> 00:03:53,232
>> Sandra: REALLY QUICK I WANT

115
00:03:53,232 --> 00:03:59,372
TO PLAY THIS, CORY STEWART,

116
00:03:59,372 --> 00:03:59,939
REPUBLICAN CANDIDATE.

117
00:03:59,939 --> 00:04:06,579
>>  >> THOSE OF US WHO HAVE TIED

118
00:04:06,579 --> 00:04:07,980
OURSELVES TO PRESIDENT TRUMP.

119
00:04:07,980 --> 00:04:09,048
WE ARE GOING TO INCREASINGLY WIN

120
00:04:09,048 --> 00:04:10,983
AS WE GET CLOSER TO NOVEMBER.

121
00:04:10,983 --> 00:04:13,986
I THINK THAT BY THAT POINT WE

122
00:04:13,986 --> 00:04:16,956
WILL HAVE A RED TIDE BECAUSE OF

123
00:04:16,956 --> 00:04:18,391
THE POPULARITY OF

124
00:04:18,391 --> 00:04:18,858
PRESIDENT TRUMP.

125
00:04:18,858 --> 00:04:19,791
>> Sandra: CLEARLY EMBRACING

126
00:04:19,791 --> 00:04:20,926
THE PRESIDENT AND HIS POLICIES,

127
00:04:20,926 --> 00:04:23,996
AND HE HAS WHAT SOME SEE AS

128
00:04:23,996 --> 00:04:24,997
CONTROVERSIAL PAST.

129
00:04:24,997 --> 00:04:26,866
I HADN'T SEEN WHETHER OR NOT THE

130
00:04:26,866 --> 00:04:29,802
RNC IS SUPPORTING HIM AS A

131
00:04:29,802 --> 00:04:30,403
CANDIDATE.

132
00:04:30,403 --> 00:04:31,971
SO OBVIOUSLY, WE SUPPORT THE

133
00:04:31,971 --> 00:04:33,406
NOMINEES OF STATES ACROSS THE

134
00:04:33,406 --> 00:04:36,008
COUNTRY, BUT WE ARE GOING TO BE

135
00:04:36,008 --> 00:04:38,844
IN THE MOST BATTLEGROUND STATES,

136
00:04:38,844 --> 00:04:41,580
THE STATES WHERE WE CAN PICK UP

137
00:04:41,580 --> 00:04:42,648
SENATE SEATS.

138
00:04:42,648 --> 00:04:49,388
WE ALSO ARE LOOKING AT STATES

139
00:04:49,388 --> 00:04:53,559
AND OTHER STATES THAT

140
00:04:53,559 --> 00:04:56,762
PRESIDENT TRUMP WANTED.

141
00:04:56,762 --> 00:04:59,565
>> SO AS YOUR SUPPORT FORCE CORY

142
00:04:59,565 --> 00:04:59,899
STEWART?

143
00:04:59,899 --> 00:05:04,470
>> WE ARE NOT IN A STATEWIDE FOR

144
00:05:04,470 --> 00:05:05,705
A VIRGINIA OR NEW JERSEY OR

145
00:05:05,705 --> 00:00:00,000
MINNESOTA, WE ARE GOING TO BE
