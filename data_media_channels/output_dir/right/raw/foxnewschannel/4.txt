00:00:38,049 --> 00:00:41,385
BE AT.

27
00:00:41,386 --> 00:00:43,320
>> IF I WAS OUTSIDE OF THE

UNITED STATES I WOULD DO

29
00:00:44,222 --> 00:00:45,522
EVERYTHING I COULD TO GET HERE.

CARAVAN IS FILLED WITH BAD

35
00:00:55,066 --> 00:00:56,066
PEOPLE AND HOMBRES.

36
00:00:56,067 --> 00:00:59,903
BUT WE CAN'T HAVE A BUNCH OF

00:00:59,904 --> 00:01:00,971
PEOPLE CROSSING THE BORDER.

38
00:01:00,972 --> 00:01:02,339
>> THERE SHOULD BE SOME AMNESTY

39
00:01:02,340 --> 00:01:04,775
GRANTED TO THEM BECAUSE OF THE

40
00:01:04,775 --> 00:01:05,441
TRAVESTIES OCCURRING IN THE

41
00:01:05,443 --> 00:01:05,776
COUNTRY.

00:01:05,777 --> 00:01:07,845
>> WE TAKE CARE OF THE AMERICAN

43
00:01:07,846 --> 00:01:08,779
PEOPLE FIRST AND FOREMOST BEFORE

44
00:01:08,780 --> 00:01:10,881
WE DEAL WITH ANYONE ELSE IN THE

45
00:01:10,882 --> 00:01:11,248
COUNTRIES.

00:01:11,249 --> 00:01:12,583
>> WHAT DO YOU THINK WE SHOULD

47
00:01:12,584 --> 00:01:14,184
HAVE A WALL ON THE SOUTHERN

48
00:01:14,185 --> 00:01:16,453
BORDER TO STOP PEOPLE FROM

49
00:01:16,454 --> 00:01:16,820
COMING IN?

50
00:01:16,821 --> 00:01:20,791
>> THERE SHOULD NO    BE IN A WL

51
00:01:20,792 --> 00:01:21,625
>> THERE SHOULD NO    BE IN A W.

52
00:01:21,626 --> 00:01:23,460
>> A WALL, BERIA IS THE

53
00:01:23,461 --> 00:01:24,995
STUPIDEST THING.

54
00:01:24,996 --> 00:01:26,430
LOOK AT THE WALL OF CHINA.

55
00:01:26,431 --> 00:01:28,766
>> THERE SHOULD BE NO WALL IN

56
00:01:28,767 --> 00:01:29,433
OUR PLANET.

57
00:01:29,434 --> 00:01:30,467
IT'S JUST WRONG.

58
00:01:30,468 --> 00:01:32,102
IMAGINE EVERY COUNTRY HAD OUR

59
00:01:32,103 --> 00:01:34,204
WALL, HOW WOULD WE EVER MOVE

60
00:01:34,205 --> 00:01:35,839
AROUND?

61
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:36,907
>> DOESN'T MAKE YOU NERVOUS

62
00:01:36,908 --> 00:01:38,008
ABOUT WHO WOULD BE COMING OVER

63
00:01:38,009 --> 00:01:40,444
HERE SINCE WE DON'T KNOW WHO

64
00:01:40,445 --> 00:01:40,978
THESE PEOPLE ARE?

65
00:01:40,979 --> 00:01:42,846
>> KNOW BECAUSE I DON'T KNOW WHO

66
00:01:42,847 --> 00:01:44,415
MOST OF THE PEOPLE ALREADY ARE

67
00:01:44,416 --> 00:01:45,883
THAT ARE HERE.

68
00:01:45,884 --> 00:01:47,184
