I'm not asking you to call this woman guilty or innocent but do you think it should be investigated that there was public mischief here I I sent as much after day as well I was very surprised that the Toronto Police Service issued a statement saying the investigation is over just like that there's obviously more to this you can tell them just because we're having this conversation there was a level of orchestration here that just doesn't make sense for the sequence of events - to be as they were described and I'm sure that's one of the reasons that the police came to the conclusion that they did but and and certainly the girl is too young to charge even though clearly she she lied and even what also appeared to me to be almost very structured and very dare I say rehearsed you know clearly somebody was coaching her yeah I really did seem rehearsed especially when her lines about I I really my heart goes out who is this man why is like the I forget the exact words she used they did not sound like an 11-year olds were words they sounded like a forty year olds words go ahead exactly children children at that age as you know as you know that there the world revolves around them you know and they are not concerned about their fellow man and what happened here why is this happening it's all about what happened to me I mean for god sake somebody tweeted at me yesterday said the average 11-year old girl is still crying an hour after she spends her nice camping yeah you know to have her up and say the things that she was saying in - - in front of the assembled media and if you saw that one shot from over her shoulder looking at the media and then how many there were there yeah you know it just none of it made sense to me it all sounded - poor castrated - too scripted to be true and and my obviously my my sixth sense told me that it was it was a made-up thing and then when I started seeing all of the prepared statements being released by mayor by the Premier of Ontario by the defense minister that one really sent me off yeah it's actually where I started tweeting was after he after new defense minister said what he did especially because he's a next time Coover police officer I mean his warning bell should have been going off just in the same way mine where that's an excerpt from my daily TV show the Ezra Levant show normally it's behind a paywall but I thought you'd like this video so we put it on YouTube if you want to subscribe to watch the daily show every day including always two interviews today and I read my hate mail just click on this screen and become a Premium Member you
