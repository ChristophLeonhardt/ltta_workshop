1
00:00:00,819 --> 00:00:01,152
QUICKLY.

2
00:00:01,152 --> 00:00:02,887
LELAND: AS YOU KNOW, WE'VE GOT A

3
00:00:02,887 --> 00:00:04,356
LONG, LONG WAY TO GO.

4
00:00:04,356 --> 00:00:06,091
GILLIAN TURNER ON THIS, THANK

5
00:00:06,091 --> 00:00:07,425
YOU.

6
00:00:07,425 --> 00:00:07,692
LIZ.

7
00:00:07,692 --> 00:00:11,296
>> A NUCLEAR CAPABLE RUSSIAN

8
00:00:11,296 --> 00:00:12,764
BOMBER WAS INTERCEPTED BY U.S.

9
00:00:12,764 --> 00:00:18,837
JETS OFF THE COAST OF ALASKA.

10
00:00:18,837 --> 00:00:20,505
THIS IS THE FIRST SUCH

11
00:00:20,505 --> 00:00:24,476
PROVOCATION SINCE LAST YEAR.

12
00:00:24,476 --> 00:00:27,212
GENERAL, THIS CAUGHT OUR

13
00:00:27,212 --> 00:00:28,480
ATTENTION NOT BECAUSE WE SAW

14
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:31,650
THIS ALMOST A YEAR AGO TO DAY

15
00:00:31,650 --> 00:00:34,419
AND ALMOST COMES ON AN

16
00:00:34,419 --> 00:00:34,819
ANNIVERSARY.

17
00:00:34,819 --> 00:00:38,757
>> TO PUT THIS IN A STRATEGIC

18
00:00:38,757 --> 00:00:39,724
TIME FRAME.

19
00:00:39,724 --> 00:00:41,693
WE'RE COMING TO BIG POWER ONCE

20
00:00:41,693 --> 00:00:45,463
AGAIN, BETWEEN UNITED STATES AND

21
00:00:45,463 --> 00:00:46,765
RUSSIA AND UNITED STATES AND

22
00:00:46,765 --> 00:00:48,967
CHINA AS WE LEARNED FROM THE

23
00:00:48,967 --> 00:00:51,102
COLD WAR, THESE ARE TESTS OF

24
00:00:51,102 --> 00:00:51,436
WILLS.

25
00:00:51,436 --> 00:00:54,806
WHAT THE RUSSIANS ARE DOING,

26
00:00:54,806 --> 00:00:57,876
PENETRATING OUR ZONE AND TESTING

27
00:00:57,876 --> 00:01:00,011
OUR RESPONSES AND WE GET TO

28
00:01:00,011 --> 00:01:00,845
PRACTICE HERE.

29
00:01:00,845 --> 00:01:02,981
THE LESS WE MAKE ABOUT THIS IN

30
00:01:02,981 --> 00:01:04,683
TERMS OF FANFARE, THE BETTER IT

31
00:01:04,683 --> 00:01:04,983
IS.

32
00:01:04,983 --> 00:01:06,618
IT'S KIND OF ROUTINE, THEY

33
00:01:06,618 --> 00:01:08,787
HARASS OUR SHIPS AND AIRPLANES,

34
00:01:08,787 --> 00:01:10,855
USUALLY WHERE THEY'RE FORWARD

35
00:01:10,855 --> 00:01:12,190
DEPLOYED, MAINLY TO INTIMIDATE

36
00:01:12,190 --> 00:01:13,692
OUR ALLIES, BUT THIS IS GOING TO

37
00:01:13,692 --> 00:01:15,827
BE A THING THAT IS GOING TO BE

38
00:01:15,827 --> 00:01:17,462
ROUTINE, AND WE'RE JUST GOING TO

39
00:01:17,462 --> 00:01:19,164
REACT NORMALLY DO IT, AND TRY TO

40
00:01:19,164 --> 00:01:20,865
KEEP THE LID ON IT AND DON'T

41
00:01:20,865 --> 00:01:23,168
GIVE THEM ANY MORE PUBLICITY

42
00:01:23,168 --> 00:01:24,536
THAN WHAT THEY DESERVE TO HAVE.

43
00:01:24,536 --> 00:01:28,707
ELIZABETH: SPEAKING OF

44
00:01:28,707 --> 00:01:29,574
PUBLICITY, WE SAW HEADLINES

45
00:01:29,574 --> 00:01:30,608
INVOLVING IRAN AND ISRAEL, TWO

46
00:01:30,608 --> 00:01:33,344
COUNTRIES WHERE THEY KNOW A

47
00:01:33,344 --> 00:01:34,112
DIRECT WAR WOULD BE ULTIMATELY

48
00:01:34,112 --> 00:01:34,879
DESTRUCTIVE SO THEY OBVIOUSLY

49
00:01:34,879 --> 00:01:36,815
TRY TO MAKE IT SORT OF A PROXY

50
00:01:36,815 --> 00:01:38,550
WAR WHICH WE'RE SEEING IN SYRIA.

51
00:01:38,550 --> 00:01:42,387
WHAT IS IRAN'S END GOAL IN

52
00:01:42,387 --> 00:01:42,821
SYRIA?

53
00:01:42,821 --> 00:01:45,323
IS IT THE PROXIMITY TO ISRAEL,

54
00:01:45,323 --> 00:01:46,491
INTIMIDATE THEM AND GET CLOSER

55
00:01:46,491 --> 00:01:48,226
TO THEM?

56
00:01:48,226 --> 00:01:49,794
AND HOW SHOULD ISRAEL BE

57
00:01:49,794 --> 00:01:50,662
RESPONDING, AS THEY ARE?

58
00:01:50,662 --> 00:01:52,864
>> WHEN IRAN LOOKS AT IT, THEY

59
00:01:52,864 --> 00:01:54,365
WANT STRATEGIC DEPTH AND ALL THE

60
00:01:54,365 --> 00:01:56,968
DEPTH THEY WANT IS WEST BECAUSE

61
00:01:56,968 --> 00:02:00,805
THAT'S LARGELY WHERE THEIR

62
00:02:00,805 --> 00:02:04,542
ADVERSARIES ARE, THE SUNNIS, AND

63
00:02:04,542 --> 00:02:06,311
THEY WANT A CANVASS THROUGH.

64
00:02:06,311 --> 00:02:07,979
AND THEY WANT TO DRIVE THE U.S.

65
00:02:07,979 --> 00:02:09,514
OUT OF THE REGION AND TRYING TO

66
00:02:09,514 --> 00:02:11,750
KILL US AND BEEN SUCCESSFUL AT

67
00:02:11,750 --> 00:02:13,752
THAT, BUT WE HAVEN'T LEFT THE

68
00:02:13,752 --> 00:02:14,119
REGION.

69
00:02:14,119 --> 00:02:16,588
THEY SEE SYRIA AS THEIR

70
00:02:16,588 --> 00:02:17,489
STRATEGIC ANCHOR POINT BECAUSE

71
00:02:17,489 --> 00:02:18,790
FROM THERE THEY CAN DO SO MANY

72
00:02:18,790 --> 00:02:19,190
THINGS.

73
00:02:19,190 --> 00:02:20,792
ONE IS ISRAEL AND TWO ALSO THE

74
00:02:20,792 --> 00:02:22,193
ARAB STATES.

75
00:02:22,193 --> 00:02:24,929
THEY'VE BEEN CONDUCTING A

76
00:02:24,929 --> 00:02:27,599
SIGNIFICANT MILITARY BUILDUP IN

77
00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:28,433
SOUTHERN SYRIA SINCE THEY

78
00:02:28,433 --> 00:02:30,101
PROPPED UP THE REGIME AND

79
00:02:30,101 --> 00:02:33,154
MOTIVATED THE RUSHES

80
00:02:33,154 --> 00:02:33,338
MOTIVATED THE RUSHE

81
00:02:33,338 --> 00:02:33,371
MOTIVATED THE RUSSI

82
00:02:33,371 --> 00:02:33,404
MOTIVATED THE RUSSIAN

83
00:02:33,404 --> 00:02:33,438
MOTIVATED THE RUSSIANS

84
00:02:33,438 --> 00:02:33,471
MOTIVATED THE RUSSIANS T

85
00:02:33,471 --> 00:02:33,538
MOTIVATED THE RUSSIANS TO

86
00:02:33,538 --> 00:02:33,571
MOTIVATED THE RUSSIANS TO C

87
00:02:33,571 --> 00:02:33,605
MOTIVATED THE RUSSIANS TO COM

88
00:02:33,605 --> 00:02:34,139
MOTIVATED THE RUSSIANS TO COME

89
00:02:34,139 --> 00:02:37,175
AND JOIN THEM AND THAT'S BEEN

90
00:02:37,175 --> 00:02:38,576
ONGOING, AND PRESIDENT NETANYAHU

91
00:02:38,576 --> 00:02:41,179
SAYS I'VE GOT A RED LINE HERE.

92
00:02:41,179 --> 00:02:43,014
NO IRANIAN TROOPS OR PROXIES

93
00:02:43,014 --> 00:02:44,182
CLOSE TO MY BORDER.

94
00:02:44,182 --> 00:02:45,884
IF THAT HAPPENS I'M GOING TO

95
00:02:45,884 --> 00:02:47,585
ATTACK THEM.

96
00:02:47,585 --> 00:02:49,087
MILITARY INFRASTRUCTURE THAT MAY

97
00:02:49,087 --> 00:02:52,157
ENDANGER OR ENCOACH ON ISRAEL

98
00:02:52,157 --> 00:02:52,590
SOVEREIGNTY.

99
00:02:52,590 --> 00:03:01,866
SO SOLNANI, HE DOESN'T REPORT TO

100
00:03:01,866 --> 00:03:03,201
THE GUARD CORPS, HE REPORTS TO

101
00:03:03,201 --> 00:03:05,503
THE AYATOLLAH, THE SUPREME

102
00:03:05,503 --> 00:03:06,004
LEADER.

103
00:03:06,004 --> 00:03:07,705
THINK OF HIM LIKE A CIA AND

104
00:03:07,705 --> 00:03:08,873
SPECIAL OPS TOGETHER, ALL THE

105
00:03:08,873 --> 00:03:10,208
TERRORISM GOES AROUND THE WORLD,

106
00:03:10,208 --> 00:03:12,644
HE'S IN CHARGE OF IT.

107
00:03:12,644 --> 00:03:14,946
ALL THE PROXIES, WHATEVER

108
00:03:14,946 --> 00:03:17,415
THEY'RE DOING, HE DIRECTS IT.

109
00:03:17,415 --> 00:03:19,818
HE WAS DIRECTED THE ROCKET IN

110
00:03:19,818 --> 00:03:20,618
GOLAN HEIGHTS.

111
00:03:20,618 --> 00:03:24,289
THE ISRAELIS RESPONDED WITH A--

112
00:03:24,289 --> 00:03:25,990
NOT A PROPORTIONED ATTACK LIKE

113
00:03:25,990 --> 00:03:28,793
WE DID OVER THE CHEMICAL ATTACK.

114
00:03:28,793 --> 00:03:31,129
THEY TOOK CAPABILITY FROM THEM.

115
00:03:31,129 --> 00:03:35,433
THEY HIT MOST OF THE IRANIAN

116
00:03:35,433 --> 00:03:35,900
THEY HIT MOST OF THE IRANIA

117
00:03:35,900 --> 00:03:35,934
THEY HIT MOST OF THE EYANIA

118
00:03:35,934 --> 00:03:35,967
THEY HIT MOST OF THE EYE IA

119
00:03:35,967 --> 00:03:36,000
THEY HIT MOST OF THE EYE RA

120
00:03:36,234 --> 00:03:36,968
THEY HIT MOST OF THE EYE RIN

121
00:03:36,968 --> 00:03:39,237
INFRASTRUCTURE IN SYRIA.

122
00:03:39,237 --> 00:03:47,912
THAT'S THE MOST SINCE YOM KIPPUR

123
00:03:47,912 --> 00:03:49,981
WAR IN 1973.

124
00:03:49,981 --> 00:03:52,650
HE SENT A MESSAGE, THERE'S A RED

125
00:03:52,650 --> 00:03:55,053
LINE HERE AND WE'RE NOT GOING TO

126
00:03:55,053 --> 00:03:55,520
TOLERATE THIS.

127
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:56,855
ELIZABETH: AND IRAN, THIS IS THE

128
00:03:56,855 --> 00:03:58,556
SAME WEEK WE'RE LEARNING THAT

129
00:03:58,556 --> 00:04:00,925
THE U.S. IS PULLING OUT OF THE

130
00:04:00,925 --> 00:04:02,493
IRAN AGREEMENT.

131
00:04:02,493 --> 00:04:04,162
I'M CURIOUS WHAT'S THE GOAL

132
00:04:04,162 --> 00:04:04,462
HERE?

133
00:04:04,462 --> 00:04:05,330
>> THAT'S A GREAT QUESTION.

134
00:04:05,330 --> 00:04:07,031
THEY WANT TO DESTROY THE STATE

135
00:04:07,031 --> 00:04:07,699
OF ISRAEL FOR SURE.

136
00:04:07,699 --> 00:04:08,233
ELIZABETH: RIGHT.

137
00:04:08,233 --> 00:04:10,468
>> THAT'S A STRATEGIC GOAL VERY

138
00:04:10,468 --> 00:04:12,871
DIFFICULT TO ATTAIN.

139
00:04:12,871 --> 00:04:13,872
WHAT THEIR MORE IMMEDIATE

140
00:04:13,872 --> 00:04:15,440
OPERATIONAL GOAL, THE IRANIANS

141
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:18,009
KNOW THEY'RE GOING TO MAKE FOR A

142
00:04:18,009 --> 00:04:20,778
NUCLEAR WEAPON SOMETIME AND I

143
00:04:20,778 --> 00:04:22,313
THINK IT'S LESS LIKELY NOW THAT

144
00:04:22,313 --> 00:04:23,715
PRESIDENT TRUMP IS IN POWER.

145
00:04:23,715 --> 00:04:24,716
AND THEY KNOW THE COUNTRY THAT'S

146
00:04:24,716 --> 00:04:27,085
GOING TO COME FIRST TO THEM WHEN

147
00:04:27,085 --> 00:04:28,253
THEY DEVELOP THAT NUCLEAR WEAPON

148
00:04:28,253 --> 00:04:28,786
IS ISRAEL.

149
00:04:28,786 --> 00:04:30,555
THEY WANT TO BE RIGHT THERE, AT

150
00:04:30,555 --> 00:04:31,623
ISRAEL WITH THOUSANDS OF ROCKETS

151
00:04:31,623 --> 00:04:34,926
THAT THEY CAN ENCROACH AND FIRE

152
00:04:34,926 --> 00:04:36,494
INTO TEL AVIV AND JERUSALEM TO

153
00:04:36,494 --> 00:04:37,495
DISCOURAGE THE ISRAELIS FROM

154
00:04:37,495 --> 00:04:39,831
EVER DOING THAT ATTACK.

155
00:04:39,831 --> 00:04:41,232
THEY'VE GOT 130,000 ROCKETS IN

156
00:04:41,232 --> 00:04:43,167
LEBANON RIGHT NOW THAT ALL CAN

157
00:04:43,167 --> 00:04:44,669
REACH TEL AVIV AND JERUSALEM.

158
00:04:44,669 --> 00:04:47,105
THEY WANT TO DO THE SAME KIND OF

159
00:04:47,105 --> 00:04:47,839
INFRASTRUCTURE ACROSS THE 45

160
00:04:47,839 --> 00:04:54,312
MILE BORDER INTO SYRIA, WHICH

161
00:04:54,312 --> 00:04:57,215
WOULD OVERWHELM THE OPERATIONAL

162
00:04:57,215 --> 00:04:58,917
SYSTEM AND NETANYAHU IS ONTO IT

163
00:04:58,917 --> 00:05:01,019
AND HE'S NOT GOING TO LET IT

164
00:05:01,019 --> 00:05:01,386
HAPPEN.

165
00:05:01,386 --> 00:05:02,186
I DON'T BELIEVE IT WILL LEAD TO

166
00:05:02,186 --> 00:05:03,922
WAR WITH IRAN BECAUSE IRAN DOES

167
00:05:03,922 --> 00:05:06,090
NOT WANT TO FIGHT A CONVENTIONAL

168
00:05:06,090 --> 00:05:08,259
WAR AGAINST ISRAEL WHICH THEY

169
00:05:08,259 --> 00:05:09,594
WOULD LOSE.

170
00:05:09,594 --> 00:00:00,000
GENERAL JACK KEANE, THANK YOU,
