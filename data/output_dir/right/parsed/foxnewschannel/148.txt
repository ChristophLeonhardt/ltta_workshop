HOW DID IT GO LAST NIGHT?
>> IT WAS PRETTY LIVELY.
THAT'S THE FINAL TIME LIKELY
THAT THEY'LL SHARE THE STAGE
BEFORE VOTERS HEAD TO THE POLLS
IN A COUPLE OF WEEKS.
SOME NAME CALLING AS YOU HEARD
AND ALSO SPARRING ON ISSUES,
EVERYTHING FROM TARIFFS TO
IMMIGRATION.
LISTEN.
>> THAT LED THE FIGHT TO SECURE
THE BORDER BUILDING A WALL,
USING TECHNOLOGY, INCREASING
BOOTS ON THE GROUND.
WE CAN KEEP OUR COMMUNITIES
SAFE.
CONGRESSMAN O'ROURKE NOT ONLY
OPPOSES A WALL, BUT HE HAS SAID
WE HAVE TOO MANY FENCES AND
WALLS ALREADY ON THE BOARD AND
WANTS TO TEAR DOWN THE ONES WE
HAVE.
>> SENATOR JOHN CORNYN AND I,
WE'RE ON POLICY TOGETHER TO
INVEST IN OUR PORTS OF ENTRY
WHERE MORE THAN 90% OF EVERYONE
AND EVERYTHING THAT COMES INTO
THE UNITED STATES FIRST CROSSES.
HAVING A BETTER IDEA OF WHO AND
WHAT COMES INTO OUR COUNTRY
MAKES US SAFER.
>> REPUBLICAN INCUMBENT SENATOR
TED CRUZ IS FIGHTSING TO KEEP
HIS SENATE SEAT.
HIS MESSAGE APPEARS TO BE
RESONATING.
HE IS PULLING AHEAD IN MOST OF
THE POLLS AHEAD BY AS MUCH AS
NINE POINTS ACCORDING TO SOME.
CONGRESSMAN O'ROURKE CAME OUT
OF NOWHERE, JUNIOR CONGRESSMAN
STARTED GIVING HIM A RUN FOR
HIS MONEY AND HAS BEEN SETTING
RECORDS WITH HIS FUNDRAISING
TOTALS BRINGING IN $38 MILLION
ALONE IN THE LAST QUARTER.
PRESIDENT TRUMP EVEN TWEETING
ABOUT THIS THIS MORNING BILL
SAYING HE WATCHED THE DEBATE
SAYING THAT HE SUPPORTS SENATOR
