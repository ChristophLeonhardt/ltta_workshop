AMERICANS HEAD TO THE POLL. WE ARE IN COUNT-DOWN MODE. JOINING ME IS THE HOUSE MAJORITY LEADER KEVIN MCCARTHY. THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME BACK. HERE WE ARE, 23 DAYS A WAY FROM THE MIDTERM ELECTION. YOU HAVE BEEN TRAVELING THE COUNTRY TO SUPPORT YOUR COLLEAGUES IN DIFFERENT RACES AS WELL AS RAISING A HUGE AMOUNT OF MONEY FOR YOUR COLLEAGUES IN THE REPUBLICAN PARTY. WHERE DO YOU SEED THE MIDTERMS HEADED? I THINK THEY HAVE CHANGED IN THE LAST MONTH. THE INTENSITY LEVEL, THERE WAS AN ADVANTAGE ON THE DEMOCRATIC SIDE. THAT HAS CHANGED AFTER WHAT THEY DID TO KAVANAUGH. THERE IS A REAL CONCERN BECAUSE MICHEAL BLOOMBURG WHO REREGISTERED A DEMOCRAT IS TRYING TO BUY THE NOMINATION TO RUN AGAINST DONALD TRUMP. HE'S PUT IN 80 MILLION DOLLARS TO WIN THE HOUSE. THE PRESIDENT WAS JUST THERE IN KENTUCKY. THAT'S ONE OF THE FIRST RACES YOU WILL WANT TO WATCH. AMY IN HER OWN WORDS. THIS IS HOW SHE DESCRIBES HERSELF. THE MOST LIBERAL DEMOCRAT IN KENTUCKY. THIS WILL BE A BATTLE BECAUSE OF THE RESOURCES THEY HAVE AGAINST US BUT THE NUMBER OF OUR CANDIDATES ARE DOING WELL AND GOTTEN A BUMP IN THE LAST FEW WEEKS. IT'S INTERESTING WHEN YOU LOOK AT THAT. THE DEMOCRATS SAID THEY WERE THE PARTY OF THE AMERICAN WORKER. WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE DONATIONS INTO THE REPUBLICAN PARTY YOU ARE BEATING THE DEMOCRATS IN THAT REGARD. THEY HAVE A HANDFUL OF BIG DEEP POCKETED DONORS LIKE MICHEAL BLOOMBURG. JUST THINK, THE THREE INDIVIDUALS FUNDING THE INDIVIDUAL PARTY. YOU HAVE MICHEAL BLOOMBURG, IT'S NOT JUST 80 IN THE HOUSE BUT 20 MILLION TO WIN THE SENATE. THEN TOM, MORE THEN $120 MILLION HE SPENT TRYING TO WIN. HIS GOAL IS TRYING TO IMPEACH PRESIDENT TRUMP. HE BRAGS THAT HIS IMPEACHMENT LIST IS BIGGER THAN AN NRA LIST. THOSE THREE INDIVIDUALS ARE TRYING TO BUY OUR GOVERNMENT IN THE PROCESS. IT'S VERY DISTURBING. I WANT TO GET TO YOUR BILL. BUILD THE WALL AND ENFORCE THE LAW, YEAH. LET ME ASK YOU ABOUT THE IMPORTANT RACES YOU ARE WATCHING. YOU MENTIONED KENTUCKY. WHAT RACES SHOULD WE WATCH? FIRST, WATCH, WHERE COULD THE REPUBLICANS DEFEAT A DEMOCRAT. I LIKE AT MINNESOTA. THOSE ARE TWO SEATS DEMOCRATS CURRENTLY HOLD THAT WE ARE IN A GOOD FIGHT TO WIN. YOU ALSO WANT TO WATCH, FOR YOUR VIEWERS, WHERE COULD THEY HELP IN THE PROCESS THIS BLOOMBURG MONEY COMING IN. IN CALIFORNIA THEY ARE SPENDING $10 MILLION. LOOK AT THE OPEN SEAT. THERE IS YOUNG KIM RUNNING AGAINST GILL WHO WAS ACCUSED EARLIER OF THIS YEAR FROM A DEMOCRAT OF SEXUAL HAAR HAASMENT. YOUNG KIM IS LEADING. WE HAVE SEVEN SEATS IN CALIFORNIA. I'VE NEVER SEEN SO MUCH MONEY BEING SPENT. GO TO BARBARA WHO IS STILL IN THE LEAD AND BEEN A BIG FIGHTER. THEN, THINK OF THIS, BLOOMBURG SENT $1 MILLION AGAINST KAREN HANDLE OUTSIDE OF ATLANTA. SHE WON THE BIG SPECIAL ELECTION EARLIER THIS YEAR. SHE'S ONE OF THE HARDEST WORKING FRESHMAN AND MOST SUCCESSFUL LEGISLATIVELY WE'VE HAD. LOOK AT THE OPEN SEAT IN MIAMI THAT'S AN HIGHLY SPANISH SPEAKING DISTRICT THAT DEMOCRATS THOUGHT THEY WOULD PICK UP EASILY. THEY NOMINATED DONNA, REMEMBER HER FROM THE CLINTON ADMINISTRATION. WE HAVE MARIA SALAZAR. SHE WAS A REPORTER ON UNIVISION AND TELEMONDO. WE NEED THE INTENSITY LEVEL. WE HAVE A DISADVANTAGE WITH MONEY. WE'LL BEAT HISTORY, WHY? LOOK AT WHAT WE'VE DONE WITH THE ECONOMY AND V.A. REBUILDING THE MILITARY RE.
