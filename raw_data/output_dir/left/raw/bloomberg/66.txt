1
00:00:00,780 --> 00:00:04,019
There is no one in India more powerful than this man.

2
00:00:04,019 --> 00:00:08,740
Victory to India!

3
00:00:08,740 --> 00:00:13,400
Four years after leading his party to a spectacular general election win, Indian prime minister

4
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:17,420
Narendra Modi remains a favorite to win again
in 2019.

5
00:00:17,420 --> 00:00:22,280
Modi travels the globe promoting a new modern
India, bear hugging world leaders along the way.

6
00:00:22,280 --> 00:00:25,600
He tweets regularly to his 40 million followers

7
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:28,060
and even connects with supporters through an app named after him.

8
00:00:28,060 --> 00:00:33,860
Prime Minister Modi and I are world leaders
in social media.

9
00:00:33,860 --> 00:00:36,000
Still, Modi’s record is mixed.

10
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,710
There are questions about whether the ground
reality has changed much under his leadership.

11
00:00:40,710 --> 00:00:44,860
And some of his biggest economic reforms have
caused confusion and disrupted the economy.

12
00:00:44,860 --> 00:00:49,960
This is the story of how Narendra Modi is
trying to rebrand India as a modern economy

13
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:52,720
and how the reality does not always match
the rhetoric.

14
00:00:56,900 --> 00:01:01,740
Since taking office in 2014, Modi has become
India’s “salesman in chief”.

15
00:01:01,740 --> 00:01:04,400
He’s largely singing the same tune,

16
00:01:04,420 --> 00:01:08,020
Iain Marlow covers Indian politics for Bloomberg
News in New Delhi.

17
00:01:08,020 --> 00:01:09,430
Come invest in India.

18
00:01:09,430 --> 00:01:10,900
Come start a business here.

19
00:01:10,900 --> 00:01:12,320
Trade with us.

20
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:14,860
Buy Indian goods. Do yoga.

21
00:01:14,860 --> 00:01:19,460
He openly courts countries like Japan, Israel
and Saudi Arabia and he’s gotten closer

22
00:01:19,460 --> 00:01:23,440
to the US, even addressing a joint session
of congress in 2016.

23
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:29,100
To all of these countries, his message is
the same.

24
00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:36,400
India is now the fastest growing large economy
with the most open investment climate.

25
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:42,400
It’s not just a dusty place where people
hang off the sides of trains.

26
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:45,530
It's a new modern economy.

27
00:01:45,530 --> 00:01:49,330
It's the skyscrapers in Bombay. it's the start-ups
in Bangalore.

28
00:01:49,330 --> 00:01:53,210
Modi came into power with the reputation
of being a pro-business reformer.

29
00:01:53,210 --> 00:01:58,150
For 13 years he was the chief minister of
the western state of Gujarat where he presided

30
00:01:58,150 --> 00:02:01,180
over more than a decade of rapid economic
growth.

31
00:02:01,180 --> 00:02:04,820
His policies became known as the ‘Gujarat
model” and they were the promise of what

32
00:02:04,820 --> 00:02:06,900
he might do for India.

33
00:02:08,199 --> 00:02:11,180
But his economic policies have gotten mixed
reviews.

34
00:02:11,180 --> 00:02:14,879
On the plus side he’s opened millions of
bank accounts for the poor, attracted more

35
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:21,320
foreign direct investment and India has eclipsed
China as the world’s fastest growing major economy.

36
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:24,320
He’s also seen a number of setbacks.

37
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:29,980
In November 2016 Modi surprised the nation
by banning 86 percent of India’s cash overnight.

38
00:02:29,989 --> 00:02:42,059
The 500 rupee and 1,000 rupee currency notes
presently in use will no longer be legal tender

39
00:02:42,059 --> 00:02:43,840
from midnight tonight.

40
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:48,459
It was as if the US banned the $20 and $100
bills overnight.

41
00:02:48,460 --> 00:02:54,200
The idea was to tackle so-called black money,
a local term for cash stashed away to avoid taxes.

42
00:02:54,209 --> 00:02:59,740
A lot of poor people thought he was hitting
the rich and then you had his critics who

43
00:02:59,749 --> 00:03:02,269
said, oh my god, what are you doing?

44
00:03:02,269 --> 00:03:10,390
You just eliminated the vast majority of cash
in a country that basically only operates on cash.

45
00:03:10,390 --> 00:03:13,560
The day after people lined up outside banks
to deposit their money.

46
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:16,239
And small businesses didn’t know how to
pay their workers.

47
00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:19,790
It caused India’s expansion to slow to a
three-year low.

48
00:03:19,790 --> 00:03:27,300
Then in June 2017 Modi introduced a national
sales tax, called the goods and services tax, or GST.

49
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:31,600
The goal of the GST was to unify India’s
complicated tax structure and make it easier

50
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:33,120
to do business, but …

51
00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:35,940
In some cases, the tax rates were really confusing.

52
00:03:35,940 --> 00:03:43,559
Say one nut, a cashew, would attract a different
tax than an almond or a peanut.

53
00:03:43,559 --> 00:03:47,439
So, if you had a bag of mixed nuts, what was
the tax rate?

54
00:03:47,439 --> 00:03:49,590
Nobody knew how to do business.

55
00:03:49,590 --> 00:03:50,900
People stopped buying things.

56
00:03:50,900 --> 00:03:53,750
The economy basically seized up.

57
00:03:53,750 --> 00:03:58,569
While the cash ban and GST have not been economically
beneficial in the short term, they still helped

58
00:03:58,569 --> 00:04:01,329
build Modi’s reputation as an authoritative
leader.

59
00:04:01,329 --> 00:04:05,809
There’s no single reason for Modi’s enduring
popularity.

60
00:04:05,809 --> 00:04:10,940
On the political side, the Hindu nationalist
agenda of his Bharatiya Janata party, or BJP

61
00:04:10,940 --> 00:04:16,350
has made him electorally successful but
it also makes him controversial.

62
00:04:16,350 --> 00:04:20,670
There are parts of the population that will
never forgive Modi for his handling of the

63
00:04:20,670 --> 00:04:24,940
2002 gujarat riots which killed as many as
2000 people, mostly Muslims.

64
00:04:24,940 --> 00:04:31,440
A lot of human rights organizations accused
the government at the time, which was run by Modi.

65
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:36,610
It actually Lead to Modi being denied a US
visa.

66
00:04:36,610 --> 00:04:38,820
But he was eventually cleared of any wrongdoing.

67
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:44,060
More recently, he has come under fire for
failing to quickly condemn attacks by Hindu nationalists on Muslims.

68
00:04:44,060 --> 00:04:50,280
Members of his own party have even supported
people accused of raping and killing a young Muslim girl.

69
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:55,080
So while India has moved up 30 places in the
World Bank's ease of doing business ranking

70
00:04:55,090 --> 00:04:57,250
since Modi became prime minister,

71
00:04:57,250 --> 00:04:59,280
Many of the problems that India is known for:

72
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:05,570
lack of infrastructure, poverty, malnutrition,
bad education system, bad health system

73
00:05:05,570 --> 00:05:07,140
haven’t changed much.

74
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:12,760
What has changed to some extent, is the momentum
that people see around India.

75
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:20,090
Modi is trying to create an India that people
can believe in, that people can be hopeful about.

76
00:05:20,090 --> 00:05:22,740
Modi remains India’s most popular leader.

77
00:05:22,740 --> 00:05:26,810
Many Indians are likely to re-elect him in
2019 with the hope that changes will come

78
00:05:26,810 --> 00:00:00,000
and it just takes time.
