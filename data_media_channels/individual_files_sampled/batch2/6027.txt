the US Immigration and Customs Enforcement Agency or ice has come under a lot of additional scrutiny in recent weeks especially due to reports of mass mistaken arrests we're talking about that a little bit later on overreaches in its investigations moving into areas to try to track people down that they hadn't previously they seemed to be emboldened and aggressive in a way they hadn't been previously and thankfully the response to them has been strong as well there have been a number of anti ice protests ice was actually put on trial in a DC protest about a month ago and people are starting to think about ice in a whole new way thanks to their terrible recent moves and now we have senator Kirsten Gillibrand who's introduced a new bill to attempt to pump the brakes a little bit on ice the Department of Homeland Security accountability and transparency Act would require border patrol and immigration enforcement agency agents to document every instance when they stop search or interrogate people the bill is currently co-sponsored by Elizabeth Warren Tom Udall and Jeff Merkley the law applies to all stops by agents who work for a CBP and ice now under current law agents from both departments have broad authority to stop and question people about their immigration status especially inside of the 100-mile border zone agents can pull over cars and board vehicles to ask passengers about their citizenship if they suspect a person is not in the country legally and then by the way that data doesn't really exist afterward they can do that we don't necessarily have any idea of how often they're doing it or what the result of it is who they're actually targeting how much reason they had to do the stop Gillibrand's bill would require the agencies to start collecting data every single time officers question someone about their immigration status when they're not at an airport or border crossing so in certain formal circumstances that have become much more common they would need to report the the time date and place of each stop the basis for questioning someone and the duration of the stop among other details the agents would also need to report information about permanent and temporary immigration checkpoints set up in the border zone this would then be reported annually to Congress and made available to the public and it's my belief that this is to serve two purposes one that after a year or two of getting this data we'd have some idea of what's actually going on because it's been perfectly it's been purposefully hidden the shadows up until now but - if you require them to document all this stuff they're gonna do a lot less of it because that sounds like a B yeah so look I know that it this country probably most countries everything's black and white and one side is always right and the other side is always wrong and that's how people perceive it but in the real world it's not actually like that so does this create more of a bureaucracy yes it does right but there's a reason for it because if you don't track things well then folks are allowed to do things that are outside the scope of the law far easier and we don't want them doing things outside the scope of the law we don't want them pulling people over base for example on race so for example two-thirds of the country is covered by this 100-mile zone next to the board which I'm amazed by two-thirds of the population is at least and and so they can go into the middle of New York or the middle of Los Angeles saying and they could say all right I'm pulling over all the Latinos now that's not legal and as you're not supposed to do that but if they never documented you'll never have evidence of it so there's a reason why they create that bureaucracy to make sure that all Americans are protected and by the way the other benefit of that is that then if they are following those procedures when ice boards a bus and ask for people for their papers then you have a little bit more confidence that they might actually have a reason to suspect someone on the bus and that their actions are more legitimate which gives you more comfort in the rule of law so you don't look at that and go oh they must be harassing people they must be racist they must be doing the wrong things it might be because they really had someone that they were looking for where there was a fugitive or they a good reason to believe that they had crossed the border illegally yeah I completely agree with this legislation and I love the fact look I think that the legislation itself is fantastic and when you look at a broader context consider the fact that on a county level right municipal level social workers who work for cash have to do an insane amount of paperwork if they work for let's say the Department of Child Protective Services right and there's a reason for that it's because you have this huge responsibility and you want to make sure that you're doing your job correctly that you're treating people fairly and you're following the law and the same type of logic should be applied to something like ice and you know stopping people and in some cases harassing them based on their physical appearance which i think is happening and people are concerned about it but the larger picture is the fact that people like Gillibrand are now proposing super progressive legislation and while some people are hesitant to support them and skeptical about their intentions it's still a good thing that we're moving the conversation to the left which honestly over the last couple decades hasn't really happened much in the country things have moved so far to the right or ever hate I mean the last 20 years this moving to the left was not a thing it just almost never ever happened and but now it is that's not like where they're gonna win on this the Trump can be to it there's still more Republicans in Congress but this is how you begin to move the Overton Window how you begin to make progress and to me one other part of it that I really liked was that Gillibrand was being responsive to the Press report about it on Vox vo X Box right and you know whether you consider the progressive outlet or not that's really positive because normally what happens in American politics is Republican legislators will be super responsive to anything said on Fox News they say diamond and silk and and there's congressional hearings both the house listen diamond is silk what happened to them on Facebook oh my god and that is it's a preposterous and as we've shown totally not factual claims about how the facebook discriminate against them etc right another hand if you're a progressive media you couldn't move a Democratic senator if your life depended on it I mean they got great joy out of spitting on progressives the most famously rahm emanuel calling progressives you know retarded and with an adjective thrown in and and so they hate the Democratic politicians historically have hated progressives and hated progressive media so for a progressive media organization to write a story then have a senator who was considered pretty establishment until recently go hey you know what that's such a good point I'd like to introduce legislation about it whoa that is fairly unprecedented it made my lifetime yeah I look the reason I wanted to cover this is one I think that this would be a positive change and I do think that it would help stop some of the the worst excesses to is that I think for the most part ninety-nine out of a hundred bills that are proposed that are actually interesting don't get any coverage I'm at least partially because of what you said it's unlikely to actually become law they don't have any government powers so there's nothing they can do about it but very often like we can get frustrated about the lack of like policy specifics proposed plans having an agenda and all that and that's 100% legitimate so long as it's true but if the media isn't reporting on it then how the hell would the people watching the shows actually know they might well think that nothing is being proposed what actually is now well that said well I think this is perfectly good changes I mean I would certainly go a lot farther it's one thing to document what they're doing it's another to rein it in specifically and say here are things you are no longer allowed to do that's certainly there there are limitations in terms of how much the legislature can constrain this executive branch department but they could they could do more I think so I would say this is this is a good jumping-off point I'm glad that it starts the conversation but I think there's a lot more that can actually be done against ice and by the way should be no to Lizabeth Warren's a co-sponsor on this as well and they're both fighting hard on it and if you were understandably skeptical about Gillibrand motives in the past I I hear you and in a lot of ways I'm with you on that but sometimes facts on the ground changed so much that they begin to change reality and the more she introduces progressive legislation after progressive legislation the more she becomes progressive and the harder it is to unwind those things and then when she takes real actions like saying she's not taking corporate Packman anymore well then she gets to some degree untethered from the corporations and becomes an actual progressive right exactly like we have like carrots and sticks at our disposal right so let's use the carrots when it makes sense let's use the sticks when it makes sense yeah so once again congratulations to Elizabeth Warren and Kirsten Gillibrand on great legislation proposed two easy ways for the young turks want us hit the subscribe button down below
