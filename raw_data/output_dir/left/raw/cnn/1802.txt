1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:07,060
mr. president welcome to the program you
are here on your first ung a president

2
00:00:07,060 --> 00:00:11,800
Trump is also making his first address
to the to the world you have many areas

3
00:00:11,800 --> 00:00:15,850
of disagreement with the current
president amongst them the Iran nuclear

4
00:00:15,850 --> 00:00:18,130
deal where you think that you should
stay in it

5
00:00:18,130 --> 00:00:22,570
president Trump has told the UN in his
first global speech that this is the

6
00:00:22,570 --> 00:00:28,140
worst deal that he's ever seen in
history and that one way or another they

7
00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:31,720
the deal is an embarrassment to the
United States and I don't think you've

8
00:00:31,720 --> 00:00:35,620
heard the last of it believe me in a
sign that he's preparing to weaken the

9
00:00:35,620 --> 00:00:39,370
deal what do you take from that do you
think he's gonna pull out you've spoken

10
00:00:39,370 --> 00:00:43,329
to him about it
I helped know and I think it would be a

11
00:00:43,329 --> 00:00:48,100
big mistake
I think if Prison III I don't say that

12
00:00:48,100 --> 00:00:54,479
this Iran deal it's a nuclear deal with
Iran is the Alpha and Omega of

13
00:00:54,479 --> 00:01:00,280
everything about how to deal with Iran
if present rams considers it's not

14
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:07,420
sufficient I do agree with that we have
this deal I think that the outcome of

15
00:01:07,420 --> 00:01:11,110
this deal is that now we have a
monitoring process with the

16
00:01:11,110 --> 00:01:17,140
international agency following the
situation and I think that it's it's

17
00:01:17,140 --> 00:01:23,200
better than nothing okay why because if
we stop with this dough if we just stop

18
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:29,950
with the nuclear agreement so we will
enter into a situation very similar to

19
00:01:29,950 --> 00:01:34,600
the Korean sea to North Korean situation
before what happens this summer so I

20
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:40,329
think it would be a big mistake now this
deal has to be completed and probably I

21
00:01:40,329 --> 00:01:46,119
will try to convince President Frank
that's the best way to address its

22
00:01:46,119 --> 00:01:52,630
concerns regarding Iran is to work into
that direction first we have to work in

23
00:01:52,630 --> 00:01:57,969
order to have a monitoring process on
ballistic missiles and ballistic

24
00:01:57,969 --> 00:02:03,100
activity of Iran that's a concern is
that a concern for the whole region we

25
00:02:03,100 --> 00:02:07,240
have to work on it and we need a new
agreement and we can we can work on

26
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:11,830
sanctions and agreements on this
ballistic side and second we have to

27
00:02:11,830 --> 00:02:16,450
complete the 2015 new
their agreement with Iran for the period

28
00:02:16,450 --> 00:02:22,690
past 2025 because this agreement just
cover still 2025 the situation but on

29
00:02:22,690 --> 00:02:26,250
the balance it makes the world a safer
place to have this nuclear deal

30
00:02:26,250 --> 00:02:32,319
definitely you know you have today some
governments not compliant with

31
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:38,319
international rules and trying to get
nuclear weapons that's it that's the

32
00:02:38,319 --> 00:02:42,400
situation we have with North Korea and
there's a situation we have with some

33
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:47,410
other countries okay the more you you
contain the situation the more you

34
00:02:47,410 --> 00:02:50,829
monitor is the more you put
international agents and you follow the

35
00:02:50,829 --> 00:02:54,940
situation very carefully the more you
can intervene and contain their

36
00:02:54,940 --> 00:02:59,379
influence I want to follow this line and
I think if we just stop with the deal

37
00:02:59,379 --> 00:03:04,780
because it was a deal negotiated by mr.
president Obama I mean it's not a good

38
00:03:04,780 --> 00:03:09,370
reason to stop with the 2015 deal and
what about President Trump at this

39
00:03:09,370 --> 00:03:15,040
moment of maximum global crisis over
North Korea calling him at the UN

40
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:20,950
Rocketman talking about destroying you
know the capabilities but very very

41
00:03:20,950 --> 00:03:27,970
provocative language look I think what
we have to do and what we we need is to

42
00:03:27,970 --> 00:03:35,980
be efficient I think that North Korean
president is probably not very sensitive

43
00:03:35,980 --> 00:03:40,840
to what happened to the UN he's not a
great client of the city and the United

44
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:47,290
Nations the guys in his own world my
point is not to increase pressure and

45
00:03:47,290 --> 00:03:54,190
words against words what we have to do
is to find the appropriate answer to

46
00:03:54,190 --> 00:03:59,200
decrease tension and protect people
people in the region and I want to think

47
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:06,280
of South Korean people living in big
anxiety I want to think about so all

48
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:10,630
region and our Japanese friends friends
and I will see a Japanese Prime Minister

49
00:04:10,630 --> 00:04:17,019
during this trip in New York and I think
the Hutt's the whole word because we I

50
00:04:17,019 --> 00:04:25,150
mean we speak about a global threat
today so for me it's how to decrease the

51
00:04:25,150 --> 00:04:30,430
tension has to contain
the North Korean situation and how to

52
00:04:30,430 --> 00:04:36,130
increase the pressure to dis is Khalid
do you think there's a military solution

53
00:04:36,130 --> 00:04:39,070
I mean sometimes the president seems to
indicate that there's a military

54
00:04:39,070 --> 00:04:44,470
solution to North Korea look at the map
if you think there is a military

55
00:04:44,470 --> 00:04:49,870
solution you speak about a lot of
victims I do believe in multilateralism

56
00:04:49,870 --> 00:04:54,310
because I do believe in negotiation I do
believe in how to control I do believe

57
00:04:54,310 --> 00:04:59,380
in building peace and I think that's
what we exactly what we have to do in

58
00:04:59,380 --> 00:05:03,639
this region the president told the
United Nations in his speech that he

59
00:05:03,639 --> 00:05:08,350
wants a tougher better deal he's very
concerned also about North Korea I spoke

60
00:05:08,350 --> 00:05:13,479
to the Iranian president who says the US
will pay if they pull out of this deal

61
00:05:13,479 --> 00:05:17,949
what is your view on that and what have
you said to mr. Trump I know you

62
00:05:17,949 --> 00:05:22,210
discussed it last night sure and I
discussed successively with President

63
00:05:22,210 --> 00:05:26,620
Trump and president rouhani about this
issue first of all our main anxiety

64
00:05:26,620 --> 00:05:32,470
today regarding nuclear weapon is about
North Korea and this situation is to be

65
00:05:32,470 --> 00:05:37,930
handled very carefully we have to avoid
military answer we have to increase

66
00:05:37,930 --> 00:05:42,010
pressure on North Korea especially
coming from China and Russia because

67
00:05:42,010 --> 00:05:47,289
North Korea is very dependent from these
two countries and we have to decrease

68
00:05:47,289 --> 00:05:51,550
the pressure and stabilize the situation
but North Korea is a very good

69
00:05:51,550 --> 00:05:57,820
illustration of a what-if scenario from
nuclear deal with Iran why because we

70
00:05:57,820 --> 00:06:03,610
stopped everything with North Korea
years and years ago we stopped any

71
00:06:03,610 --> 00:06:08,830
monitoring any discussions with them and
what's the result they will probably get

72
00:06:08,830 --> 00:06:16,030
nuclear weapon so my position for ayrenn
deserve a president ramp was to say look

73
00:06:16,030 --> 00:06:19,240
at the situation on North Korea I don't
want to replicate the security situation

74
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:23,860
with Iran let me ask you about how you
deal with President Trump because he

75
00:06:23,860 --> 00:06:29,050
says some things in person he says some
things on Twitter his ministers say

76
00:06:29,050 --> 00:06:34,690
other things how do you deal with the
leader of the free world in this kind of

77
00:06:34,690 --> 00:06:38,440
situation some have described it as kind
of chaotic some say they don't quite

78
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:40,520
know who to listen to
what

79
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:45,530
does president Macomb use to deal with
the President of the United States

80
00:06:45,530 --> 00:06:49,849
I have very direct discussions with
President Trump I do appreciate him we

81
00:06:49,849 --> 00:06:54,259
have a very good personal relationship
and and I have very direct discussion

82
00:06:54,259 --> 00:06:57,919
with them
I don't interfere in in domestic poses

83
00:06:57,919 --> 00:07:04,099
and what you describe as interferences
or discrepancies between different

84
00:07:04,099 --> 00:07:07,909
members for me there is one voice your
presence you elected your present and

85
00:07:07,909 --> 00:07:13,639
and this is the voice I consider and the
man icepick with and and it's always the

86
00:07:13,639 --> 00:07:20,569
same thing we we share our views he's
very direct and I think I think listen

87
00:07:20,569 --> 00:07:25,819
to what I propose what are the main
areas of disagreement right now I think

88
00:07:25,819 --> 00:07:31,490
the very first these disagreements is
very well known is about climate and as

89
00:07:31,490 --> 00:07:37,219
president Trump decided to leave Paris
agreement I mean that's his choice and I

90
00:07:37,219 --> 00:07:42,289
do respect his choice and he was elected
on the basis of such a decision but I do

91
00:07:42,289 --> 00:07:47,780
regret this decision and and I do want
to convince him to come back to this

92
00:07:47,780 --> 00:07:54,080
agreement because for me that's the core
agreements for climate and I I do

93
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:56,539
believe that especially after the serie
Kings

94
00:07:56,539 --> 00:08:04,370
we just had both in the US and in France
we do see the direct consequences of co2

95
00:08:04,370 --> 00:08:10,009
emissions and and all this climate
change we have to fight against this

96
00:08:10,009 --> 00:08:14,029
climate change and we need the global
mobilization for that so we have a

97
00:08:14,029 --> 00:08:18,770
disagreement on this issue but I will
keep pushing we have direct discussion

98
00:08:18,770 --> 00:08:23,449
yesterday we will implement Paris
agreement on our own at the French level

99
00:08:23,449 --> 00:08:27,830
but the European level as well we have a
strong agreement with the Chinese and

100
00:08:27,830 --> 00:08:31,699
the older pours and I think it's very
important to preserve this multilateral

101
00:08:31,699 --> 00:08:37,849
approach and now is that an issue for
the u.s. itself to see what they want to

102
00:08:37,849 --> 00:08:42,979
do and what President Trump wants to do
with his climate but we have to deal

103
00:08:42,979 --> 00:08:46,640
with that the president says this is a
bad deal we can get a better deal it's

104
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:51,170
bad for the economy it's bad for the
climate it's bad for the United States

105
00:08:51,170 --> 00:08:55,320
what do you say when he says that to you
I mean first of all it's not bad for the

106
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:58,920
climate for climate and environment
definitely and especially if he decides

107
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:04,500
to leave it will be worse because the
u.s. is a very great contributor in

108
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:09,000
terms of co2 emission so that's an issue
and if you don't fix the situation in

109
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:13,770
the US you aren't credible to tell the
others what they have to do and you have

110
00:09:13,770 --> 00:09:18,510
direct consequences of the situation so
no this agreement is not bad for climate

111
00:09:18,510 --> 00:09:25,500
it's wrong on them on them even the
short mid and long run is that a good

112
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:30,150
agreement for the US and for all of us
why because it's true that in order to

113
00:09:30,150 --> 00:09:34,170
deal with climate change you will have
to change a lot of things in our

114
00:09:34,170 --> 00:09:38,970
economies I mean you will have to stop
certain activities regarding fossil

115
00:09:38,970 --> 00:09:43,830
fuels regarding classical industrial
activities because we know that they

116
00:09:43,830 --> 00:09:49,380
pollute a lot but you will create new
jobs to reduce emissions it means more

117
00:09:49,380 --> 00:09:56,360
innovation more jobs in cleaner sectors
which brings me then to the very major

118
00:09:56,360 --> 00:10:01,770
philosophical point that you're making
which is continue the historical

119
00:10:01,770 --> 00:10:06,930
relationship continue multilateralism be
really part of the world you know

120
00:10:06,930 --> 00:10:09,720
president Trump has said make America
great again

121
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:14,010
he sort of kind of shifts between being
part of the world and being you know

122
00:10:14,010 --> 00:10:20,370
protectionist and isolationist
what gave you the courage to go against

123
00:10:20,370 --> 00:10:24,930
that trend during your election campaign
I remember before the election you said

124
00:10:24,930 --> 00:10:28,140
this is a great moment for France to go
in the opposite direction of the

125
00:10:28,140 --> 00:10:34,560
prevailing trends you know take on
anti-globalization take on populism what

126
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:39,030
made you do that and believed that you
could win doing that because I know the

127
00:10:39,030 --> 00:10:45,930
outcome of this trend it's wrong I do
know the outcome of this turn a tional

128
00:10:45,930 --> 00:10:54,270
ism is all about war we experienced that
80 years ago in Europe so at the end of

129
00:10:54,270 --> 00:11:01,050
the day if if you believe that there is
nothing to change this trend and we have

130
00:11:01,050 --> 00:11:06,990
to accept anti-globalization anti
materialism problem nationalism what

131
00:11:06,990 --> 00:11:11,490
action ISM and so on it's all about at
the end of the day it's all about how to

132
00:11:11,490 --> 00:11:15,890
fight against each other and it's all
about war

133
00:11:21,459 --> 00:00:00,000
you
