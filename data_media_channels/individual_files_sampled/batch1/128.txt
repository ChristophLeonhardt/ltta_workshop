Hamas is military wing the kasam brigades are burying their dead three of their members were killed on Friday afternoon Israel struct various Hamas monitoring posts along the border soon after an Israeli soldier was shot from Gaza he later died of his wounds 60 sites belonging to Hamas were attacked by Israeli forces late into the night a few rockets were fired from Gaza in response the ceasefire was announced hours later it's the second ceasefire in a week I don't think the city's fire would last for the long time a long period I think it is very fragile II unfortunately and we will have just a couple of days to truce or calm situation and after that we'll have the same situation because many problems of the people in Gaza Strip Gaza community are still not solved the pattern of escalation ceasefire escalation ceasefire between Israel and Hamas well let me continue unless there was a long-term plan to alleviate the situation for the people here almost two million people are living under this blockade and everyone says the same thing how impossible life has become here look I can't afford anything to work as a tailor in Israel before the blockade I made around $1,300 a month at the moment I can't even make $300 a month exchanging money I work two shifts a day morning and night malla the meaning of humanity is missing in Gaza most people are educated but can't find work people are frustrated and depressed people are willing to die those who are married cannot feed their children patients can't get medication and there's no electricity this is really painful and sad Palestinians here have little power to influence the political decisions made either in Gaza or Israel no one wants another war but as one woman asked us what do we need to do to be able to live like everyone else it's definitely Decker al Jazeera Gaza
