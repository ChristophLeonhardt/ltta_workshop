COMMITTEE. NEXT STOP, A FULL SENATE CONFIRMATION VOTE AS EARLY AS TOMORROW. BRET? Bret: PETER DOOCY, LIVE ON THE HILL. LET'S GET MORE NOW FROM OKLAHOMA SENATOR JAMES LANKFORD WHO SITS ON THE INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE IN THE SENATE. SENATOR, THANKS FOR BEING HERE. YOU ARE ASSESSMENT OF THIS REPORT THAT CAME OUT OF YOUR COMMITTEE TODAY, I HAD LOT OF RIGHT UP SAYING, IT GOES REALLY AGAINST THE HOUSE COMMITTEE ON THIS VERY TOPIC. Senator Lankford: IT'S AN INTERESTING SPIN TO SAY IT GOES AGAINST THE HOUSE COMMITTEE. ALL WE DID WAS LOOK AT THE ASSESSMENT FROM THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION THAT THEY DID IN DECEMBER, LITERALLY THE FINAL MONTH FOR THE PRESIDENT. HE PUT OUT A QUICK RUN THROUGH OF WHAT INTELLIGENCE THEY HAD AT THAT POINT, WE LOOKED AT IT AND EVALUATED WHAT THEY HAD AT THAT POINT INSIDE A "YES," THAT'S WHAT THEY HAD. THEY EVALUATED IT AND SET FOR THE RUSSIANS TRYING TO HELP PRESIDENT TRUMP AT THE END? YES. THE BIGGER QUESTION WAS NOT OUT THERE, WHERE THEY ALWAYS TRYING TO HELP THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN? NO. THAT'S NOT IN THE REPORT. THE RUSSIAN STARTED WORKING ON CAMPAIGN ISSUES IN THE UNITED STATES IN 2014, THEY DIDN'T EVEN KNOW THE CANDIDATES AT THAT POINT. THEY WERE DETERMINED TO FIND SOME WAY TO MEDDLE IN THE CAMPAIGN AND WORKED FOR MULTIPLE CAMPAIGNS THROUGHOUT THE PROCESS. SO THAT WAS THROUGH THE FINAL MONTHS. WERE THEY TRYING TO ENGAGE WITH AND THE FINAL MONTHS? SURE. WERE THEY IN THERE THE WHOLE CAMPAIGN, NO THEY WERE NOT. Bret: HERE IS THUS IN A MINORITY REPORT ABOUT THAT TRUMP TOWER MEETING. SENATE REPUBLICANS INTERVIEWED ONLY 12 WITNESSES IN TOTAL. AN INFAMOUS KREMLIN CONNECTED LAWYER WAS ALLOWED TO PROVIDE ONLY WRITTEN ANSWERS. OUR REPUBLICAN FRIENDS DECIDED NOT TO EVEN INTERVIEW TWO OF THE OTHER KEY PARTICIPANTS IN IN OTHER KEY PARTICIPANTS IN INH OTHER KEY PARTICIPANTS IN INE MEETING. JARED KUSHNER, AND PAUL MANAFORT. TO CALL THE SENATE JUDICIARY COMMITTEES TRUMP RUSSIA INVESTIGATION HALF-HEARTED IS TOO GENEROUS. Bret: YOUR THOUGHTS? Senator Lankford: THAT IS A SAD DESIGNATION OF WHAT HAPPENED IN THE SENATE JUDICIARY. HE KNOWS FULL WELL THAT THE SENATE JUDICIARY AND SENATE INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE HAS GONE THROUGH THIS. I KNOW DEMOCRATS ARE TRYING TO MAKE SOMETHING OF THIS BUT THIS IS A RABBIT HOLE FOR THEM. THEY ARE CONSTANTLY TRYING TO ACCUSE AND SAYING THERE MUST BE SOMETHING HERE THAT WE CAN STIR UP OR AT LEAST CREATE AN ACCUSATION THAT HAS THE APPEARANCE OF IT. WE INTERVIEWED EVERYONE WITH THAT WAS THERE AND WENT THROUGH ALL THE DOCUMENTS. EVERYONE'S STORY HAS BEEN CONSISTENT AND THERE WAS NO COLLUSION THAT WAS PART OF THAT MEETING. IT WAS A DECEPTIVE REACH OUT FROM AN INDIVIDUAL THAT THEY HAD CONNECTED TO DURING ONE OF THE PAGEANTS. IT WAS A MUSIC PERSONALITY THAT THEY MET WITH AS A PERSONAL FAVOR. WHEN YOU GO THROUGH ALL THE INTERVIEWS, IT'S OBVIOUS THERE'S NOTHING THERE AND THERE IS NO REASON EVEN FOR THEM TO GO THROUGH IT. MY FEAR IS THAT DEMOCRATS CONTINUE TO MAKE SOMETHING OUT OF NOTHING AND IF YOU LOOK AT THE FACTS INCLUDING ALL THE TESTIMONY TODAY, YOU WILL SEE THERE WAS NOTHING TO THAT MEETING. Bret: WHERE DOES THIS GO NEXT? OBVIOUSLY WE ARE WAITING FOR THE NEXT SHOE TO DROP WITH A BOB MUELLER INVESTIGATION BUT WHERE DOES THIS ALL GO NEXT? Senator Lankford: THE HOUSE INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE RELEASES THE REPORT AND WE RELEASED THE SECOND PART OF OUR REPORT IN THE DAYS AHEAD. WE ARE TRYING TO GET OUT OF THAT AS WELL AND WE ARE WRAPPING UP OUR REPORTS AND TRYING TO GET THROUGH ALL THE FINAL DOCUMENTS. OUR HOPE IS THAT THE MOLAR INVESTIGATION IS ALSO DRAWING TO A CLOSE TO BE ABLE TO FINISH OUT THEIR INVESTIGATION. MY FEAR IS IF YOU GO BACK TO IRAN-CONTRA AND INVESTIGATIONS DONE BY THE SPECIAL COUNSEL AND PRESIDENT REAGAN, THAT WAS SIX YEARS THEY DRUGGED THAT OUT. WE WANT TO HAVE THEM DO THEIR WORK, FINISH THEIR WORK AND BE ABLE TO GET IT DONE. Bret: WHAT ABOUT THE CONCERN THAT RUSSIA IS GOING TO DO IT AGAIN IN THE MIDTERMS OR 2020? Senator Lankford: WE SHOULD BE AWARE IN ALL LIKELIHOOD, RUSSIA WILL TRY SOMETHING AGAIN. THIS IS SOMETHING THAT EUROPEAN COUNTRIES FACE EVERY SINGLE YEAR AND WESTERN EUROPEAN COUNTRIES FACE MULTIPLE TIMES. I ASSUME IF THEY DO IT ONCE THEY WILL WILL DO IT AGAIN. IT WILL JUST NEED TO BE AWARE THAT IF THEY SEE THINGS ON SOCIAL MEDIA, THAT'S NOT ALWAYS AN AMERICAN TRYING TO PUT OUT INFORMATION ON EITHER SIDE OF AN ISSUE. AMERICANS ARE FREQUENTLY SEEING SOCIAL MEDIA AND ASSUMING IT'S A FELLOW CITIZEN, AND IT'S NOT. Bret: THERE OBVIOUSLY A LOT OF DEMOCRATS AND SOME OTHERS THAT SAY THEY ARE NOT HAPPY WITH WHAT THEY SAW FROM DONALD TRUMP JR. IN THE COMMITTEE, AND AS THE TRANSCRIPT OF THE INTERVIEWS ARE BEING RELEASED, HERE IS SENATOR BLUMENTHAL ON ALL OF THAT AND WHAT HE'S GOING FORWARD. HE NEEDS TO COME BACK AND TESTIFY IN PERSON UNDER OATH. THERE IS A LOT THAT NEEDS TO BE EXPLAINED, THE CONTRADICTIONS ARE APPARENT ON THE RECORD, BUT EVEN MORE SO WHEN I ATTENDED THIS INTERVIEW. I HAVE NO CONFIDENCE THAT HE HAS THAT. Bret: DO YOU THINK HE NEEDS TO COME BACK? Senator Lankford: I DON'T THINK HE NEEDS TO COME BACK. HE'S APPEARED BEFORE THE SENATE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE, HE'S DONE HOURS AND HOURS OF TESTIMONY AND THAT HAS BEEN CONSISTENT. THEY ARE JUST DIGGING AND HOPING THEY CAN FIND SOMETHING OR LEAVE AND INNUENDO, THAT MAYBE THERE IS A SECRET QUESTION THEY CAN ASK TO FIND SOMETHING. THE HARD PART IS AFTER MONTHS AND MONTHS OF THIS INVESTIGATION, THEY ARE NOT FINDING ANYTHING. MAYBE I COULD BRING HIM BACK ONE MORE TIME, I WILL. BUT IT'S JUST NOT THERE. Bret: RUDY GIULIANI HAS SAID THAT MUELLER HAS TOLD HIM THAT HE WILL ADHERE TO THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT GUIDANCE, AND THERE WILL NOT BE AN INDICTMENT OF THE PRESIDENT. Senator Lankford: QUITE FRANKLY, THAT'S THE SAME THING THAT JIM COMEY TOLD THE PRESIDENT. HE TOLD THE PRESIDENT OUT THREE TIMES IN THEIR MEETINGS. EITHER THAT HAS COME UP, OR THEY HAVE BOTH SAID THAT OVER AND OVER AGAIN. SO I WOULD BE SURPRISED BY THAT BUT I DIDN'T HEAR IT FIRSTHAND THAT THERE WASN'T GOING TO BE AN INDICTMENT, BUT THAT WOULDN'T SURPRISE ME AS THAT HASN'T BEEN THE CENTER OF THE INVESTIGATION NOR HAS THE ROLE OF THE SPECIAL COUNSEL TO TRY TO GET AN INDICTMENT BY THE PRESIDENT. HIS ROLE WAS VERY CLEAR TO SEE IF THERE WAS CRIMINAL ACTIVITY AMONGST THE CAMPAIGN. THE PRESIDENT HAS EVER BEEN LISTED AS THE SOURCE OF THIS ACTIVITY, OR THAT THESE ACTIVITIES EVEN EXISTED. HE WAS DOING RESEARCH TO SEE IF ANYTHING DID OCCUR. TO BE ONE LAST THING, HOW LONG DO YOU THINK THIS IS GOING TO TAKE BEFORE WE KNOW A CONCLUSION ONE WAY OR THE OTHER? Senator Lankford: THE NEXT FEW MONTHS, THE SENATE INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE WILL WRAP UP YOUR WORK AND GET THEIR INFORMATION OUT THERE SO EVERYONE CAN SEE IT AND AS MUCH POSSIBLE DETAIL AS WE CAN GET OUT IN CLASSIFIED FORM. THE HOUSE INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE IS ALREADY WRAPPING UP AND WE WOULD HOPE THE SPECIAL COUNSEL WILL DO THE SAME. OBVIOUSLY WE DON'T CONTROL SPECIAL COUNSEL, WE ARE INDEPENDENT OF US BUT WE HAVE GONE THROUGH A LOT INDEPENDENT OF US BUT WE HAVE GONE THROUGH A LOT OF INTERVIEWS
