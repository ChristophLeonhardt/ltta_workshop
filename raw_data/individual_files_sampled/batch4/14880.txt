oh man what's up guys I gotta admit this was kind of tough to pick the very first project to review so I want to pick something that was both classic and relevant with the movies coming out and the political climate going on and what better films review then the classic 1982 Blade Runner let's get into it I think some of the biggest questions with these classic classic that a lot of movies just are not that good when you go back and watch them but do they hold up and does this revolutionary project still hold up this day is it's still relevant and do the themes apply to what's going on today literally today because I'm in Los Angeles and it's set in 2019 which is right around the corner you haven't seen it I don't know we I don't know where you've been but spoiler now the original Blade Runner was released in 1982 directed by Ridley Scott the original box of a score was about 27 million but was made for 35 million however there have been seven different versions of this movie released because once it came out in theaters and people were able to step back and appreciate it it was unbelievably inspiring for so many creative artists in the industry so what is this movie about the big concern going on in this world as mankind has now blurred the lines between man and technology man and machine but machine in the sense of these new humanoid creatures they created called replicants identical to humans and most every single way even physically superior what he did was he gave them four year lifespans so they would not be able to fully take over if that would ever happen and they were banned from planet Earth the movie follows detective Decker a Blade Runner and Blade Runner has nothing to do with sexual job which is really cool and they throw into his job is to retire these replicas to hunt down any rogue replicants that are still on earth his job is to hunt them down and kill them or retire them now Dec a retired Smith's job however he's called back in the line of duty when full replicants escaped from their offworld planets and make it down to earth for reasons unknown and that is the general plot start of Blade Runner let me give you my critic review of Blade Runner it's a 5 out of 5 I mean it is absolutely spectacular to see what Ridley Scott was able to accomplish I mean every single shot is a work of art I mean honestly to the point of when you're watching the movie a lot of times you'd get distracted from the conversations going on just to take in the world that he's created around it the meticulous detail is unprecedented it is you can see the strokes of a master crafts what truly makes this movie great as a film is the script it does a great job of discussing some macro problems and then struggles that people have such as meaning and purpose every single one of the main characters in the movie are struggling with this however you can see a heightened version of it in the replicates because they only have four years to live so you get to see people like Deckard who was a retired Blade Runner who is at one of the top food chain positions even says in the movie that if you're not copy or little people he had a job that he was great at and he had a lot of admiration for it however his job but he could not find his meaning his purpose in it likewise Tyrell who's designed these replicants who in essence is playing God with these people who were still ending up being flawed because we're putting herself in it he is also shown to be a very unhappy lonely isolated person he would one find the movies not even sleeping he's just alone this tower by himself checking stocks I think it's a call from his apparent only friend who's just a sick employee who he plays chess with it's not exactly what you think the you know hierarchy would be living this lavish lifestyle it's the same struggles that are universally experienced by everyone now as a viewer if you're gonna go into this movie just to buy it ticket sit down know nothing about it you're actually not gonna like it as much I'm gonna give it a three out of five the characters are actually very unlikable for example the lead Deckard is actually a very depressed drunk who is somewhat bad at his job either they say he's a good believer but he seems to have really struggled every single person he encounters likewise the lead girl rachel has this air of superiority talking down people about her and when she comes crashing down to earth she still kind of maintains that and is very cold and standoff it's through most of the movie also these two have a love interest that seems to spark almost out of nowhere ending with a romance borderline on sexual assault and the replicants themselves the villains the antagonist of the movie you do latch on to a little bit but then you see the unbelievable horrors that they do trying to accomplish their goal in the movie that it's hard to really care and latch on them as well but faith is where it gets really interesting and I'm gonna talk about this movie through the lens of faith or the biblical truths or principles that I think I control from it also though are there any values that I think are universal and needed and appreciated right now that we could talk about and you see this happened to so many people in life when they this is all do they have this this world around me so why don't I just die full force in all these relationships or orb use this or try to just focus on money or focus on material things constantly cuz all I want to do is just overdose on life and you get to see this in a condensed version with badi when he's trying to go after Deckard and in his last moments were like that even releases a white dub which is a clear symbol to of the Holy Spirit in the Bible it's as if it finally took and he finally understood after all this crazy life experience what was going on then Deckard is just sitting back seeing this micro compressed version of his own life and from him the he himself was trying to be self-destructive and destroy everything about and killed himself with alcohol another and other like crazy advances going on however these replicas came to earth just to get a few more seconds of the light that he was just piddling away you give him a whole new perspective on life I think it's a great example too of it doesn't matter what your situation or class is you're not gonna find true purpose or meaning just because of the situation job or money that you have in the movie like I said all the main players are somewhat miserable throughout the entire movie they're all looking for something more they're trying to find that meaning that purpose I'm so happy to say that Blade Runner does hold up and it is not something that can be taken out of context to push any political weird agenda going on right now this isn't its Universal struggles that people are always gonna be dealing with no matter what culture your problem matter what background you're from there's something from the movie you could definitely take away from and I am so happy the nostalgia was not faked it really is that good of a movie but does the sequel hold up gotta check out the next video and that is my rebel real review you
