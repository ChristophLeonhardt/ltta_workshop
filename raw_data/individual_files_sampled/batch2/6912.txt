rodrick tally is a black man who used to live in Little Rock Arkansas but he has moved to Mississippi following a no-knock raid that happened in his home years ago he is now suing the authorities as a result of this raid because they lied in an affidavit and she actually has the evidence to prove it so he recalled how police used explosives to enter his apartment actually last August and ultimately unsuccessfully searched for cocaine so they were looking for cocaine they found no cocaine and the way that they did this was through something known as a no-knock arrest warrant and it was obtained under false pretenses so what were those false pretenses so let's go to the police affidavit all right in this affidavit officers filed to searched Ali's apartment police say that they sent an informant to his door with $100 to buy cocaine now the three officers said they observed the door open and saw the informant have a conversation with someone in the apartment later the informant explained that he purchased cocaine from two black men at Tally's address except none of that happened and we know that based on the surveillance that tally has he has a camera set up just outside his door and if you look at the next video you will see that no one opens the door okay so this is the time that he theoretically did the deal according to the informant and what they say is that the cops witnessed this happening okay but as you're seeing in this video he never opens the door okay it goes unanswered and and the informant starts to talk to himself and a cop later writes down oh yeah I saw the deal happen but there is no deal there was no deal wait till you see the video what he's got recorded inside okay he and there's a great irony to why he was recording both outside and inside his house okay so let's go to the next video we and by the way just to be clear with you guys full disclosure the videos long so we did speed it up but we didn't edit anything out of it you're seeing everything in college like we need we didn't edit out the part where he actually does talk to him exactly like we're not being misleading or anything we just want to speed up the video so you can see the full context let's go to the next one okay so as you can see again surveillance outside of his door someone with the authorities takes a photo of the outside of his door but no one opens the door inside the apartment no one sells drugs nothing like that happens okay so the cop did not see any transaction he comes and takes a picture anyway he's like we're gonna bust this guy's door open but they don't just ran the door wouldn't they don't know I said no knock by a definition they blow the door open with an explosive yep in fact all right again there there was no transaction okay so there was no probable cause they had no right to a no-knock warrant but it didn't matter they made things up in that affidavit in order to get the no-knock warrant and it resulted in this and it's terrifying so they used an explosive device to get into the apartment 11 cops show up and they raid the apartment and guess what they found they found no cocaine no cocaine but I mean they could have easily killed him and luckily they didn't he's under the door by the way he was sleeping on the couch and they blew the door off onto him and what's amazing is if these I mean this looks like Fallujah right these guys come in heavily militarized and they don't find anything they actually find the guy under the door and they don't care well I thought you were in big danger well why you've actually found the so-called suspect why aren't you then taking precautions they said hey want to have fun they want to bust people they want to meet their quotas etc and they want to blow people's doors off you know that afterwards they don't pay for the doors even if the guy's innocent so it cost them like $1500 to replace ters one lady had her front door and her back door blown off and she doesn't have enough money she replaced the front door but now the back door it just has cardboard on it okay which by the way encourages crime exactly and now you wanna hear the irony of why Roger Talley was taping even inside his own house because robbers had come in and he wanted to catch the robbers so he actually needed the cops but the cops didn't care to actually do their job and protect them and said they blew his door off and they could have easily killed him at the door it hit him in the wrong way and then even though they knew they had the wrong guy they arrested him they said oh we found marijuana in his apartment so attorney Benjamin Crump is the individual representing Roderick Talley in this lawsuit you might remember him because he was also the lawyer for Trayvon Martin's family following his death at the hands of Zimmerman George Zimmerman so Benjamin Crump actually shared some statistics they did a Freedom of Information requests and they found some pretty interesting statistics regarding no-knock warrants in Little Rock Arkansas and they said that officers used boilerplate language on most of the 133 no-knock warrants of which 110 were for black citizens many of the rates again this is according to the attorney in which the police used explosives to blow up doors turned up nothing but residents were left to pay for the damages so if you don't know with that boilerplate language means is that they copied and pasted it so they don't care what's inside they just want to blow some doors off make some arrests they don't care that they're innocent and the judge what are you doing this is look is there I had Benjamin Crump here yesterday he's we did an interview with him on T YT interviews at which you should check out and and he explained and I asked him specifically is there a circumstance where a no-knock warrant is warranted yes yes a judge can give a no-knock warrant and it would make sense if you've got a drug kingpin like a Pablo Escobar and you don't want to not because he's got 12 guys inside that are you know I armed and that's why you blow the door off right but it's supposed to be really really rare in in Little Rock on it's a tiny little town they've done it over 200 times and in this case the same language is used in 133 cases yeah whatever who cares there's no specific hey I know this guy did X Y & Z I'm just copying and pasting let's go to blow the guy's throw it off and then quiz to that layout of 133 times they use the same language 110 were blacks guys poor black people who have no power and so it's easy to blow their doors oh and then some right-wingers will turn around and go well it didn't happen to me so I don't believe it and that's the point they target poor black people because they know that they're having trouble fighting back and Benjamin Crump was very honest he said look when Roger tally reached out to me I was skeptical he's like cuz you know because he's and a lot of high profile cases thousands of people reach out to me every day say I was framed and he's like it's often not true okay we we take very few cases but what we saw the evidence it was absolutely clear that the cops lied about seeing a trans drug transaction that did not happen he owes a barber shop so and and we know what Roderick did he's in a lot of ways an American Hero initially he didn't get a Crump to represent him because he and he's and so he did it himself he found a way to find a file a lawsuit hold him accountable he found more people that they had done it to then Crump sees the video and he goes okay wait a minute oh my god you're absolutely right he comes in and and starts defending this guy how often do they do this throughout the country and you never hear about him the thing that sticks out to me is that this man is obviously someone who's willing to fight back to a large degree to go through all the work that he did without a lawyer and to file the case and to find other examples of it and yet he still felt compelled to leave Little Rock and move back home to family and Mississippi because he's too scared to live there I would be terrified I would be tense I mean someone can suffer a serious heart attack I mean you could have died just from the door yeah exactly from projectiles and by the way one other thing you know you talked about the reaction of some people in the country when the issue of police brutality or so forces brought up one other way that people react to it or respond to it is by slandering the actual victim as someone who hates the cops but Tali said this and I thought this quote was telling I'm not against the police at all I call the police when stuff happens to me but bad police I'm very against and innocent people going to jail I'm completely against from now I would call that the tally principle who could possibly be against that quote right I mean it's the moats I can't believe we have to explain the most obvious things to people and that's why this saying is black lives matter because it's black folks across this country go I can't believe I have to say this but you know our lives matter too it's not too much to ask for you to care about our lives in fact he said look I remember he had called the cops of protected from the robbers in another instance that's why he was recording and he said but he was disappointed to find out he showed them the video of how they had they did the guy that had come had never talked to him right he said the cops looked at that video and looked at the video of the door getting blowed off and they started laughing and he said that's when he realized they don't care my life means nothing despite that particular incident which is you know sad I still believe that most cops are good cops despite you know growing up in New York in the 70s and with movies like Serpico but I knew a lot of cops in New York but I think it the the the the inherent issue is what comes down from the top and the systemic incarceration of minorities in this country especially young black men and the feeding of the private prison systems and so this seems to be systemic where the falsified affidavits were a matter of course a matter of normal process yeah that it happens all the time let's figure out a way we can justify busting in this guy's door and these cops are if they were accountable for that wouldn't be doing it so it's coming down from from higher up and it's a systemic issue all across this country well I'll add a second me to it and we talked about this on the show whole time it's in the training it's in what they teach the cops are cops different than human beings I think of course not right we're all human and so what are they teaching them so in this case so you saw the video they're teaching them to be the military but they're not the military they're cops cocaine like over as what was supposed to be a small cocaine transaction which they knew was not actually a cocaine transaction and let's be fair to even those guys in the video there's 11 guys in there they don't necessarily all know that it was fake they might think it's real the original cop who took the picture of the door he knows his fake right now his bosses know it's fake but they still keep on doing it and by the way a lot of those guys who were framed they're still in prison so that's part of what Crump's doing he's trying to get them out of prison well if you guys have this informant who's an obvious liar and you use the informant and all these different times and you've got these but the boilerplate language you're copying pasting how many of these guys are innocent of course not every one of them is innocent but you got to look at all those cases very very seriously and we've militarized our police and and overall I think the number one problem is we've taught them be afraid of everything everything is a threat and whatever you do don't don't say freeze like you know when we're grown up they'd say freeze put your hands up you're under arrest no just blow their doors off with an explosive go in there and and it like like it's Romana and and and mess him up right yeah used to be a thing in New York I got busted in two and my rehearsal that I was in we were we were rehearsing a play that that was about a war it was oh it took place in a war and we were down a little Italy and apparently some cops were driving by and they thought there was some something real happening they busted into us and and and and took control of that room so professionally that it didn't endanger us that's that's the way it can be done on the go don't worry we got you covered you still listen to TYT at our new podcast network find us on Apple podcast at Google Play Store or at TYT
