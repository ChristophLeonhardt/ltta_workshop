in the times of Trump mainstream media just lives for leaks three people familiar with the intelligence ultimately people familiar with the component sources close to McCain who former officials knowledgeable about the situation tell CNN but are the leaks all just part of a bigger game now according to Republican Senator Mark Meadows he has proof that there was a coordinated effort by FBI agents and members of the DOJ to leak information regarding the alleged Trump rush at collusion this is the letter he sent to the Department of Justice our review of these new documents raises grave concerns regarding an apparent systemic culture of media leaking by high-ranking officials of the FBI and DOJ related to ongoing investigations so what's the documentation well we've gotten messages from Peters Strock former FBI special agent to his mistress Lisa Paige an FBI attorney who just happened to be working on the Bob Muller investigation Peter struck actually lost his job after messages he sent to Lisa Paige were made public those messages were politically charged and revealed that the couple wasn't exactly fond of Donald Trump Trump's not ever going to become president right right no no he won't we'll stop it now here are some glaring examples from those messages that were included in Meadows letter to the DOJ Peter strong contacts Lisa Paige to discuss a media leak strategy specifically the text says I had literally just gone to find this phone to tell you I want to talk to you about media leak strategy with DOJ before you go Peter strop congratulates Lisa Paige on a job well done while referring to two derogatory articles about Carter page in the text stroke warns Paige to articles are coming out one which is worse than the other about Lisa's namesake stroke added well-done page a media strategy interesting now the attorneys representing Peter Strock say it's not what it sounds like it's actually simply a strategy for stopping the leaking of unauthorized information from the administration but the FBI has been caught leaking information to reporters before they've been caught red-handed let's not forget that former FBI director James Comey actually admitted to the Senate Intelligence Committee that he leaked information about a conversation he had with Donald Trump to a reporter I understood this to be my recollection recorded of my conversation with the president as a private citizen I felt free to share that thought it very important to get it out and there's James Comey second-in-command Andrew McCabe now he also got the can he was fired for leaking information to the Wall Street Journal about the Clinton Foundation investigation so is this leaking strategy actually intentional in hurting the administration there's certainly some information that points in that direction who have the worst case scenario where the government's own security agency the police department of the government is trying to maintain the power of the current administration and even after they've lost that power they're trying to undermine the new administration so the next time you hear the words persons close to the investigation or informed sources think where this media leaking strategy might lead next kaleb Maupin RT New York you
