1
00:00:00,088 --> 00:00:02,423
NEVER ENTERED U.S. AIRSPACE

2
00:00:02,423 --> 00:00:06,461
BUT CAME WITHIN 55 MILES.

3
00:00:06,461 --> 00:00:08,530
PETE: PETE,

4
00:00:08,530 --> 00:00:08,563
PETE: EDTE,

5
00:00:08,563 --> 00:00:08,796
PETE: ED,E,

6
00:00:08,796 --> 00:00:09,631
PETE: ED, I LIKE WHAT YOU

7
00:00:09,631 --> 00:00:12,100
DID WITH STAIRWAY WALK.

8
00:00:12,100 --> 00:00:12,767
CHALLENGING PRESIDENT TRUMP

9
00:00:12,767 --> 00:00:13,835
TO BE WATERBOARDED.

10
00:00:13,835 --> 00:00:14,135
WATCH.

11
00:00:14,135 --> 00:00:15,169
THIS REMEMBER HOW THE

12
00:00:15,169 --> 00:00:15,970
GENTLEMAN IN THE WHITE HOUSE

13
00:00:15,970 --> 00:00:17,405
TALKED ABOUT TORTURE ON THE

14
00:00:17,405 --> 00:00:17,872
CAMPAIGN TRAIL.

15
00:00:17,872 --> 00:00:19,741
WHAT I WOULD LIKE TO SAY IS

16
00:00:19,741 --> 00:00:20,775
I WOULD LIKE YOU TO TRY IT I

17
00:00:20,775 --> 00:00:21,876
THINK PEOPLE WHO HAVE

18
00:00:21,876 --> 00:00:23,578
ACTUALLY BEEN TORTURED, WHO

19
00:00:23,578 --> 00:00:24,946
ARE SAYING THIS IS NOT A

20
00:00:24,946 --> 00:00:25,813
GOOD THING, YOU SHOULD

21
00:00:25,813 --> 00:00:27,382
LISTEN TO THEM BECAUSE YOU

22
00:00:27,382 --> 00:00:29,484
HAVE NEVER BEEN TORTURED.

23
00:00:29,484 --> 00:00:32,954
AND NEITHER HAS DICK CHENEY.

24
00:00:32,954 --> 00:00:34,489
PETE: THAT WAS WHOOPI.

25
00:00:34,489 --> 00:00:36,157
BRING IN THE AUTHOR OF

26
00:00:36,157 --> 00:00:38,059
ENHANCED INTERROGATION

27
00:00:38,059 --> 00:00:38,826
DR. JAMES MITCHELL HELPED

28
00:00:38,826 --> 00:00:40,461
DEVELOP THE CIA'S INTEAR

29
00:00:40,461 --> 00:00:46,267
CONGRATULATION PROGRAM AND

30
00:00:46,267 --> 00:00:47,201
INTERROGATED KHALID SHEIKH

31
00:00:47,201 --> 00:00:47,569
MOHAMMED.

32
00:00:47,569 --> 00:00:48,836
WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF WHOOPI'S

33
00:00:48,836 --> 00:00:50,071
COMMENTS AND HOW THEY

34
00:00:50,071 --> 00:00:52,674
REFLECT THE MEDIA'S VIEW OF

35
00:00:52,674 --> 00:00:54,409
WHAT YOU HAD TO DO TO KEEP

36
00:00:54,409 --> 00:00:54,976
OUR COUNTRY SAFE?

37
00:00:54,976 --> 00:00:57,545
>> WELL, HONESTLY WHO THINKS

38
00:00:57,545 --> 00:00:58,947
WHAT WHOOPI GOLDBERG THINKS.

39
00:00:58,947 --> 00:01:01,382
I'M TEMPTED TO COMPLETELY

40
00:01:01,382 --> 00:01:01,950
DISMISS IT.

41
00:01:01,950 --> 00:01:03,251
ON SECOND THOUGHT, MAYBE SHE

42
00:01:03,251 --> 00:01:04,751
COULD SHOW US HOW IT'S DONE.

43
00:01:04,751 --> 00:01:06,187
THE NEXT TIME THERE IS

44
00:01:06,187 --> 00:01:07,388
CREDIBLE INTELLIGENCE OF

45
00:01:07,388 --> 00:01:10,892
ANOTHER CATASTROPHIC ATTACK

46
00:01:10,892 --> 00:01:12,293
WITH THE POTENTIAL TO KILL

47
00:01:12,293 --> 00:01:12,994
THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE IN THE

48
00:01:12,994 --> 00:01:13,695
UNITED STATES, MAYBE SHE

49
00:01:13,695 --> 00:01:15,229
COULD GO TO UNSAFE PLACE IN

50
00:01:15,229 --> 00:01:16,598
THE WORLD AND INTERROGATE

51
00:01:16,598 --> 00:01:17,732
THE TERRORISTS AND I WILL

52
00:01:17,732 --> 00:01:18,266
STAY BACK HOME.

53
00:01:18,266 --> 00:01:19,567
I WILL STAY SAFE WITH MY

54
00:01:19,567 --> 00:01:20,702
FAMILY AND CRITICIZE HER

55
00:01:20,702 --> 00:01:22,537
LIKE SHE CRITICIZED US.

56
00:01:22,537 --> 00:01:26,207
I THINK WHAT SHE IS DOING

57
00:01:26,207 --> 00:01:29,377
REALLY IS VALUE SIGNALING.

58
00:01:29,377 --> 00:01:30,645
PREENING IN FRONT OF AN

59
00:01:30,645 --> 00:01:32,146
AUDIENCE THAT LIKES HER TO

60
00:01:32,146 --> 00:01:34,582
SHOW HOW MUCH MORE MORALLY

61
00:01:34,582 --> 00:01:35,950
SUPERIOR SHE IS TO US.

62
00:01:35,950 --> 00:01:36,851
I WOULD SAY AS A

63
00:01:36,851 --> 00:01:37,685
PSYCHOLOGIST THAT SHE NEEDS

64
00:01:37,685 --> 00:01:41,889
TO BE CAREFUL THE REASON FOR

65
00:01:41,889 --> 00:01:44,158
THAT IS A STRONG WILLED MAN

66
00:01:44,158 --> 00:01:45,560
LIKE DONALD TRUMP, IF HE IS

67
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:46,494
EXPOSED TO THE WATER BOARD,

68
00:01:46,494 --> 00:01:48,863
HE IS NOT GOING TO THINK

69
00:01:48,863 --> 00:01:50,064
LIKE WHOOPI GOLDBERG SEES.

70
00:01:50,064 --> 00:01:51,966
HE MAY SEE HIS HARSHNESS AND

71
00:01:51,966 --> 00:01:53,334
THINK THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT WE

72
00:01:53,334 --> 00:01:53,635
NEED.

73
00:01:53,635 --> 00:01:55,003
WE MAY NEED TO BE DOING MORE

74
00:01:55,003 --> 00:01:56,270
OF THAT REMEMBER, WHEN THEY

75
00:01:56,270 --> 00:01:57,171
WERE TRYING TO DECIDE

76
00:01:57,171 --> 00:01:58,306
WHETHER OR NOT WATERBOARDING

77
00:01:58,306 --> 00:02:01,042
WAS LEGAL, I WATERBOARDED AN

78
00:02:01,042 --> 00:02:01,709
ASSISTANT ATTORNEY GENERAL

79
00:02:01,709 --> 00:02:03,277
OF THE UNITED STATES.

80
00:02:03,277 --> 00:02:05,146
HE GOT UP OFF THE WATERBOARD

81
00:02:05,146 --> 00:02:06,180
AND DECIDED THAT NOT ONLY

82
00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:07,181
WAS IT LEGAL.

83
00:02:07,181 --> 00:02:09,484
NOT ONLY WAS IT NOT TORTURE.

84
00:02:09,484 --> 00:02:12,253
BUT IT DIDN'T VIOLATE OUR

85
00:02:12,253 --> 00:02:13,554
TREATIES WITH OTHER

86
00:02:13,554 --> 00:02:13,988
COUNTRIES.

87
00:02:13,988 --> 00:02:15,890
SO, I THINK SHE JUST NEEDS

88
00:02:15,890 --> 00:02:17,392
TO BE CAUTIOUS.

89
00:02:17,392 --> 00:02:18,993
PETE: WHEN YOU WATER BOARED

90
00:02:18,993 --> 00:02:20,461
THAT ASSISTANT A.G.

91
00:02:20,461 --> 00:02:21,729
THE IDEA WAS YOU WANT THIS

92
00:02:21,729 --> 00:02:23,131
TO SEE WHAT THIS FEELS LIKE.

93
00:02:23,131 --> 00:02:24,832
HE OR SHE STOOD UP AND SAID

94
00:02:24,832 --> 00:02:26,034
IT BROUGHT ME TO THE

95
00:02:26,034 --> 00:02:28,302
PRECIPICE, I PROBABLY WOULD

96
00:02:28,436 --> 00:02:29,937
ULTIMATELY I'M SAFE AND JUST

97
00:02:29,937 --> 00:02:31,105
FINE AFTERWARDS.

98
00:02:31,105 --> 00:02:31,906
>> ACTUALLY, IT WAS THE

99
00:02:31,906 --> 00:02:32,607
OTHER WAY AROUND.

100
00:02:32,607 --> 00:02:34,108
HE DEMANDED THAT WE

101
00:02:34,108 --> 00:02:34,976
WATERBOARDED HIM SO HE COULD

102
00:02:34,976 --> 00:02:36,310
DECIDE WHETHER OR NOT IT WAS

103
00:02:36,310 --> 00:02:36,644
TORTURE.

104
00:02:36,644 --> 00:02:37,912
AND THEN IN THE RUN UP TO

105
00:02:37,912 --> 00:02:39,814
DOING THAT I WATERBOARDED A

106
00:02:39,814 --> 00:02:42,183
CIA ATTORNEY, A WOMAN, WHO

107
00:02:42,183 --> 00:02:44,052
WOULD NOT ALLOW US TO

108
00:02:44,052 --> 00:02:45,453
WATERBOARD THE ATTORNEY

109
00:02:45,453 --> 00:02:46,154
GENERAL, THE ASSISTANT

110
00:02:46,154 --> 00:02:46,921
ATTORNEY GENERAL UNTIL SHE

111
00:02:46,921 --> 00:02:47,655
WAS WATERBOARDED.

112
00:02:47,655 --> 00:02:49,090
AND BOTH OF THEM SAID

113
00:02:49,090 --> 00:02:50,224
ESSENTIALLY THE SAME THING.

114
00:02:50,224 --> 00:02:51,025
IT SUCKED.

115
00:02:51,025 --> 00:02:53,127
I WOULDN'T WANT TO DO IT

116
00:02:53,127 --> 00:02:53,461
AGAIN.

117
00:02:53,461 --> 00:02:54,595
BUT I DON'T THINK IT'S

118
00:02:54,595 --> 00:02:55,063
TORTURE.

119
00:02:55,063 --> 00:02:56,931
NOW, THE LAWS HAVE CHANGED.

120
00:02:56,931 --> 00:02:57,799
AND THAT'S THE OTHER THING

121
00:02:57,799 --> 00:02:59,701
THAT I THINK YOUR VIEWERS

122
00:02:59,701 --> 00:03:00,535
PROBABLY SHOULD BE AWARE OF.

123
00:03:00,535 --> 00:03:03,037
THIS IS A TEMPEST AND A

124
00:03:03,037 --> 00:03:03,371
TEAPOT.

125
00:03:03,371 --> 00:03:04,739
THE LAWS HAVE CHANGED.

126
00:03:04,739 --> 00:03:06,941
THE MORAL LANDSCAPE HAS

127
00:03:06,941 --> 00:03:07,275
CHANGED.

128
00:03:07,275 --> 00:03:07,909
WATERBOARDING IS OFF THE

129
00:03:07,909 --> 00:03:08,810
TABLE NOW.

130
00:03:08,810 --> 00:03:10,645
SO, FUSSING AND GETTING

131
00:03:10,645 --> 00:03:12,046
HYSTERICAL ABOUT

132
00:03:12,046 --> 00:03:12,947
WATERBOARDING IS AN

133
00:03:12,947 --> 00:03:16,484
IRRELEVANT WASTE OF TIME.

134
00:03:16,484 --> 00:03:20,088
IT'S SIMPLY VALUE SIGNALING.

135
00:03:20,088 --> 00:03:21,756
>> DR. MITCHELL COULD THERE

136
00:03:21,756 --> 00:03:23,758
BE A WORLD AGAIN WHERE

137
00:03:23,758 --> 00:03:25,326
WATERBOARDING ISN'T OFF THE

138
00:03:25,326 --> 00:03:25,626
TABLE?

139
00:03:25,626 --> 00:03:26,994
HAVE WE FORGOTTEN WHAT OUR

140
00:03:26,994 --> 00:03:27,862
ENEMY ALSO DO TO US?

141
00:03:27,862 --> 00:03:28,963
>> I ACTUALLY DON'T THINK

142
00:03:28,963 --> 00:03:30,631
IT'S NECESSARY RIGHT NOW,

143
00:03:30,631 --> 00:03:31,733
GIVEN OUR CURRENT THREAT

144
00:03:31,733 --> 00:03:32,767
SITUATION AND THE

145
00:03:32,767 --> 00:03:33,935
CAPABILITIES OF OUR

146
00:03:33,935 --> 00:03:34,368
ORGANIZATION.

147
00:03:34,368 --> 00:03:37,672
BUT FUTURE BAD GUYS EVER GET

148
00:03:37,672 --> 00:03:39,073
A NUCLEAR WEAPON, CAN YOU

149
00:03:39,073 --> 00:03:40,241
BET YOUR AS IT'S GOING TO BE

150
00:03:40,241 --> 00:03:41,309
ON THE TABLE AGAIN.

151
00:03:41,309 --> 00:03:41,976
NO PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED

152
00:03:41,976 --> 00:03:44,045
STATES IS GOING TO ALLOW A

153
00:03:44,045 --> 00:03:45,446
TERRORIST TO SET OFF A

154
00:03:45,446 --> 00:03:46,647
NUCLEAR BOMB IN NEW YORK

155
00:03:46,647 --> 00:03:48,549
CITY OR LOS ANGELES OR

156
00:03:48,549 --> 00:03:51,252
CHICAGO OR SEATTLE OR

157
00:03:51,252 --> 00:03:52,520
PORTLAND BECAUSE THEY WANT

158
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:53,988
TO MAINTAIN THE MORAL HIGH

159
00:03:53,988 --> 00:03:54,322
GROUND.

160
00:03:54,322 --> 00:03:55,990
IF THEY DO, THEY OUGHT TO BE

161
00:03:55,990 --> 00:03:57,358
RAN OUT OF TOWN ON A RAIL

162
00:03:57,358 --> 00:03:59,794
BECAUSE THAT'S JUST

163
00:03:59,794 --> 00:04:00,461
DESPICABLE.

164
00:04:00,461 --> 00:00:00,000
PETE: DR. JAMES MITCHELL,
