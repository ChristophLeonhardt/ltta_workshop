talking about the Kavanaugh effect now for two weeks meaning the well we've been doing about the effect of Democrats on the Cavanaugh confirmation which is shameful in too graceful but now we're seeing the Cavanaugh effect on the midterm elections and this is hurting Democrats in races across the country not just the swing states but races that we were pretty certain that we were gonna lose are now looking like they might flip for reaction we turn to Cory Spartacus Booker I hurt where dick durbin called me I had tears of rage when I heard about this experience in that meeting and for you not to feel that hurt and that pain mmm Wow could we I'm sorry could we just one more time before we really get into the show here could you could you tell me a senator Spartacus what did you feel I hurt where dick durbin called me I had tears of rage when I heard about this experience in that meeting and for you not to feel that hurt and that pain mmm very good thank you thank you very much tears of rage that's what Democrats are feeling all around the country hear the Cavanaugh effect is affecting a lot of races so we've got Dean Heller in Nevada that race is turning around martha mcsalley right now in Arizona has a six-point lead over her Democrat opponent Kyrsten Sinema so this is the race at you know with the Jib we thought Arizona was probably going to flip with John McCain dying with you know flake stepping down and right now martha mcsalley is leading there's also in that race a Green Party candidate Angela green the bet coincidence is just too much right she was she must have just it's just probably like some random street person she thought I know what I can do I know how I can make some money for the next two months the Green Party Angela green so she she's gonna play a role too she's gonna pull some votes away from the Democrat it seems why is that the case why aren't the democrats united because they overplayed their hand on Brett Kavanaugh you know it's it's very easy to separate people by race it's much harder to separate people by gender because the genders are constantly unified and together we all have mothers many of us have lives and girlfriends you know women have fathers and sons and husbands and boyfriends so it's it's much harder if you overplay your hands if it if it seems that you're being unfair and assassinating the character of a guy just for being a guy just because you can that's a that's a real problem so and we're seeing that you know we're seeing this play out not just in the Senate we're seeing it on campuses as well we'll get to that a little bit later Marsha Blackburn is up 18 points on Democrat Phil Bredesen in Tennessee a little note of warning on this this is according to the New York Times that she's up 18 points I don't really believe this before the race showed her up just I think six points according to even the most ambitious polls right now they have polls in real time and the New York Times you're seeing numbers come in as they are contacting people I don't know this is obviously about the entertainment aspect of Elections but I am a little skeptical still 18 points is pretty pretty good so even if she's really only up 8 points or 9 points or even 6 points pretty good and and those numbers were not looking that way before in Texas remember we were told that beta O'Rourke the robert Francis overworked he goes by beto or Beto but he's is colloquially known among Republicans as Beta Beta O'Rourke is now down to 44 points Cruz looks at he's up at 53 I mean that's a that's a sizable lead again it's it's still close he's still within striking distance but those numbers that that gap really widened because of Cavanaugh right now Nate Silver has dropped his prediction that Democrats will take the Senate down to nineteen point four percent likelihood so that's the this is an all-time low for this midterm cycle really not looking good now a word of caution I don't want Republicans to get complacent the Democrats according to silver have a 78% chance of taking the house which you know historically speaking they're likely to take the house they probably as a as a matter of trends they should take the house but their chances to take this at the Senate are much lower now and then that brings us to North Dakota this race is one of the most beautiful ones Heidi Heitkamp ever since this Cavanaugh thing has dragged on her numbers have been falling and then she finally decided she was gonna vote no on Cavanaugh and you know Joe Manchin ended up voting yes another swing state Democrat a Democrat in a state that voted for Trump Heidi Heitkamp said no why because she's got a lot of pressure on her from the left money is gonna go away donor donor money of course also foundations organizations that are donating to her that money will dry up those activists will dry up those ground game supporters will dry up if she voted for what she thinks about you know if she voted for what is just and also what probably would be politically right in a general election that would have all gone away so look the Cavanaugh thing was exposed as a total farce and Heidi Heitkamp however now is trying to have it both ways she was always trying to have it both ways we'll talk about politicians who try to have it both ways now so she votes no on Kavanagh here's Heidi trying to explain this away make sure I understand you listen to his testimony yeah I listen to his testimony and then I went back and watched his testimony with the sound turned off what does that do for you because I think that there's so many different ways that you communicate and you learn a lot by doing that it's it's a it's an it's an old trick that I use to really try and understand what's being communicated the old trick that I try to you this is the old trick that I so when reality doesn't agree with my preconceived idea logical convenient notions this is a little trick that I use I take my two fingers and I plug them into my ear and then I close my eyes really tight and I make this out la la la la la I can't hear you la la la la la that's the heidi heitkamp trick this is the worst excuse she could have possibly come up with it says you know you heard Kavanaugh and you found his testimony compelling right yes yo yeah totally know what he said when he said what he said then I believed it so Dan I did this little trick I you did him I put I muted him I listened with the sound off okay this is something by the way so sometimes at night sweet little ELISA will will say to me I'll mention something and I'll say you know I talked about this on the show today she goes Oh Mac I listen to your show every day on mute I everyday I've got to take it up on my iTunes and I click the mute button and I listened to the whole show that's less heidi heitkamp talking back brick Avenue I listened to brick Kevin all the time on you okay really sad it's the best that they've got this this obviously is an emperor has no clothes moment I mean she was just totally caught with it the best she could say is yeah well I listen to him and he was compelling so then I forgot then I tried to forget but also it you know it shows the difference between conviction politicians and convenience politicians and this is an important distinction because when you look throughout history history has a probably many more convenience politicians than conviction ones but history doesn't look kindly on convenience politicians people who just go with the wind don't stand for anything at all just want people to like them just want to grand eyes as to self-aggrandizement World War II you've got Lloyd George or Lloyd George Neville Chamberlain these squishy wishy wishy-washy people and then you've got Winston Churchill who look Winston Churchill had major election losses he had major victories for civilization but he was a conviction politician he knew what he believed he knew what he believed about the Soviet Union what he believed about Hitler what he believed about Nazi Germany all these other guys squishy wishy Neville Chamberlain Lloyd George history looks on them like total cowards in modern parlance they'd be called Kuck you know it's just nobody wants to be that Addante it puts the apathetic in in the first first circle of hell when he when dante goes into hell when he passes through the gates of hell the first people he encounters or the apathetic the people the angels who didn't rebel against god but they didn't defend god they just were always in it for themselves they'd kind of were a little wishy-washy they didn't have any convictions those guys he sometimes is misquoted you know there's that quote all it takes for evil to succeed is for good men to do nothing and this is variously attributed to Edmund Burke and and Dante and all of these people none of whom said those precise words but that's where it comes from and Dante it's the first souls that he encounters and they're damned mercy doesn't want them justice doesn't want them heaven doesn't want them hell doesn't want them they're just they're just in it for themselves and that is politicians like Heidi Heitkamp there and it's so pathetic I mean nobody why would you put yourself through this why would you put yourself through the grueling awful experience of running for office sitting in office going to all those spaghetti dinners going to constituent town halls what why would you do that if it's for nothing other than yourself what is the point of that you know the convenience politician par excellence is Bill Clinton he of course he is the one he's back in the news now as well but you know that Bill Clinton actually had a basically good presidency you know a lot of good things come out of his presidency not in the first couple years but only after Newt Gingrich and the Republicans won the Congress and Clinton went along with them but there were there were many achievements of welfare reform tax reform free trade deals there were a lot of good things that came out of the Clinton presidency his wife is a little less so you know his wife too goes along with the spirit of the age you remember in 2008 she said abortion should be safe legal and rare then she came around and said abortion you know should be a sacrament basically she's running in 2016 and she just you know a safe legal and rare never made any sense if abortion is just some meaningless medical procedure why should it be rare if it's tantamount to murder why should it be illegal and you know just trying to be mealy-mouthed have their cake and eat it too Bill Clinton would say this I think he was asked about the Gulf War what he would have done with regard to sending in American troops in the Gulf War the first Gulf War and he I I'm only slightly misquoting him when he said well I would have gone along with the opinion of the majority but I would have felt empathy with the feeling of the minority uh I feel your pain I feel your pain that's the that's his campaigner I feel your pain and so now the Clintons are back in the news because history doesn't look kindly on those people who stand for nothing and the other problem by the way with people who stand for nothing is they can really become radicalized Hillary more than her husband had leftist convictions she wrote her whole College thesis on Saul Alinsky on rules for radicals she'd loved the guy should write to him all the time and the trouble is when the spirit of the age moves far left moves in a radical direction they are there they become radicals and Hillary more than her husband tried to push the spirit of the age in that direction as well so now they're going on big stadium tour to do I don't know to do a two-man show to do a little vaudeville act probably a bad idea though during the me to age because do you outlook I don't know if you're a history buffs or not but Bill Clinton had a few accusations thrown against him and they were much more credible than Brett Kavanaugh so Christiane Amanpour to her credit she's a terrible journalist but to her credit she asks Hillary Clinton what about the allegations against your husband here's what she has to say you're gonna be prepared to have questions about that moment in 1998 the impeachment the allegations of sexual harassment against your own husband are you prepared to answer those questions is he prepared to answer them and how do you see that similar or different from what President Trump is being accused of and Cavanagh and others today well there's a very significant difference and that is the intense long-lasting partisan investigation that was conducted in the 90s if you know the Republicans starting with President Trump on down want a comparison they should welcome such an investigation themselves excuse me what we you were asked about the allegations you were asked about the elegant she says oh it's the difference is that darn monster Ken Starr that's the difference the vast right-wing conspiracy so well maybe you could talk about the allegations first also if you want an investigation Brett Kavanaugh just testified more than all other Supreme Court nominees combined and he he also had a seventh FBI investigation into him so even that doesn't make any sense but just look at that she learns nothing first of all she doesn't believe anything that's why for her it always just goes back to this investigation and they wronged me and me me me me me but she she was singing this exact same tune in the 1990s here is Hillary Clinton could have been yesterday though it was actually 20 years ago talking to Matt Lauer on The Today Show about the allegations against her husband First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton candidly answered questions with NBC's Matt Lauer on The Today Show this morning she wasted no time in slow special prosecutor Kenneth Starr accusing him of being behind the allegations that have rocked the presidency we get a politically motivated prosecutor who is allied with the right-wing opponents of my husband who has literally spent four years looking at every telephone a million dollars and more than that now but looking at every telephone call we've made every check we've ever written scratching for dirt intimidating witnesses doing everything possible to try to make some accusation against my husband if he were to be asked today mrs. Clinton do you think he would admit that he again has caused pain in this marriage no absolutely not and he shouldn't the great story here for anybody willing to find it and write about it and explain it is this vast right-wing conspiracy that has been conspiring against my husband since the day he announced for president that's that's the story the vast right-wing conspiracy that was her phrase by the way I had to change the clip there at the end talk about conspiracies when you watch that first clip on YouTube the audio cuts out when you get to the money line when you get to the vast right-wing conspiracy I don't know there might be a vast left-wing conspiracy there but that's what she said it's all about the vast right-wing conspiracy forget the allegations she was singing that same tune then she doesn't learn anything she doesn't learn that you can't call half the country deplorable and irredeemable she's still doing it two years later she doesn't learn any of these things she's unable to see the hypocrisy two of the investigations you heard there you know Matt Lauer chiming and Owen spends 30 million dollars all it's been so and now I wonder what Hillary Clinton thinks about the Muller investigation into Trump I wonder what she thinks about special counsels independent counsels obviously it would have flipped and she can't see the hypocrisy because of the defining feature of the Clintons which is shamelessness and pride hubris they go hand in hand if you're very very prideful you can't you can't see your own flaws you and you can't feel any shame so that the defining feature of the Clintons they could look you in the face and say I do not have sex with that woman two seconds later yeah I think I might have had sex with that woman but listen you should still believe me no shame at all and and that's what's motivating this tour look it's gonna be a stadium tour all of the questions are gonna be highly vetted of course they're not no one's gonna be able to get in their face with a camera or anything like that but even so they can't see that in the me2 era in the era that was made possible because Hillary Clinton lost they were finally Democrats were finally able to talk about the sexual misconduct it typifies by the Clinton administration in the me2 era maybe it's not a great idea Hillary for you and Bill to be out there doing a little soft-shoe on stage they can't see it it's so much pride and it's so dishonest and and speaking of conspiracies speaking of the vast right-wing conspiracy I will point out at least our conspiracy is honest at least the vast right-wing conspiracy not that not what she's talking about and not the left-wing conspiracy but the actual right-wing conspiracy you know that we're all a part of here welcome to the conspiracy at least we're honest about it were not pretending we're not being sanctimonious cocaine Mitch was really excellent about this he's turned the the cough fa up to like pablo escobar's levels here's cocaine Mitch explaining why he's completely ready to confirm a Supreme Court justice or implying he's completely ready to confirm a Supreme Court justice even in the election year of 2020 if Donald Trump were to name somebody in the final year of his first term in 2020 are you saying that you would go ahead with that nomination well I understand your question and what I told you was what the what the history of the Senate has been you have to go back to the 1880 to find the last time a vacancy created in a presidential election year on the Supreme Court was confirmed by a Senate of a different party than the president's that's the hizzle in if you can't answer that question are you saying that well the answer to your question is we'll see whether there's a vacancy in 2020 I love that answer so don't you think it's a little hypocritical well you know I just do I'm just well do you remember in 1492 Christopher Columbus sailed the ocean blue it's actually even less deceptive than that because what he would McConnell is saying is yeah this that just that's not how it works truck and nobody knows how the Senate works better than Mitch McConnell this guy knows how the machinery of the Senate works and he's saying yet and of course in an election year when the Senate is controlled by the party by a different party than the White House of course they're not going to confirm a nominee why would they they haven't done it since 1880 he's not saying he's not coming up with some sanctimonious hubbub he's not dragging out women and and you know manipulating women who may or may not have suffered any assaults and putting them on TV and using them as tearful human shields he's saying no that's just the way politics works I'll be very honest about it I love it and but you know he doesn't quite answer the question so then chris wallace says well don't you think it's hypocrite or are you gonna confirm somebody in 2020 and mitch mcconnell's well just one second Christie would excuse me for one second oh and and he's exactly right that's exactly the right answer chuck Grassley is kind of playing games and being a little deceptive but mitch is being spot-on honest about it and honestly political great I'll take that any day the president Trump is honestly political he's honestly political in what he says and I think people like that they you know some sanctimonious people want to pretend that there's something unpleasant about it I don't think I find that much more pleasant than Hillary Clinton smearing her husband's victims and her husband's accusers and then quote talking about vast right-wing conspiracy z' and being so sanctimonious quivering lip on unmanned tower absolutely speaking of why we fight I have got the great Sebastian Gorka coming on the show today he's got a wonderful book why we fight defeating America's enemies with no apologies he is it gives us a great insight having worked in the White House with the administration without further ado dr. Gore can we got a lot more coming up after that dr. Gorka thank you for being here my pleasure Michael my pleasure you know I mean you know I'm a big fan of yours I'm a big fan of everything you write and tweet and when you're on television I really like the book why we fight and in this moment this Cavanagh moment I'm thinking not just of why we fight abroad but why we fight at home as well this was a brutal fight you you're an insider you've been in the administration what lessons do you think conservatives can take away from this bloody Kavanagh battle very very simply that the Democrats have made their Faustian bargain when they want power they will do whatever it takes to get the power they take a man I mean look this is not an insult I love the Matt he's a godly man but he's actually a boring Boy Scout a milquetoast decent guy then Brett Kavanaugh and they're prepared to accuse him of serial rape and attempted murder it means they have no morals I mean it's not immoral Michael it's a moral yes it's it's it's a sociopathic level of greed for power and and it also demonstrates that they've never given up they lost the election but they will grasp at anything to maintain power and if that means turning the Supreme Court into a legislating radical body then that's what they're going to do but I have to say one thing I know he's my old boss and we stay in touch what the president did yesterday was epic to the hill with terrific I mean just to the whole world to say he is innocent in front of his mother his wife his daughters it was the right thing to do and it's pure Trump it was it was total moral clarity as well this is something I'm constantly surprised by his people say Oh President Trump he never has read a book he doesn't go to church he doesn't I say okay regardless of any conjecture you might have he is able to identify clear moral issues his tweet about Christopher Columbus was excellent I mean even from that even from these issues he really does seem to cut through the fog a do we elect the President to give us a pistol a logical discourse ontological debate no we'll leave that to Drew Clavin I mean seriously that's right and I would like to know - speaking of epistemological debate we're even reading the tea leaves you know ambassador nikki Haley has stepped down at the UN everybody is rending their garments gnashing their teeth I think I'm the only person who like doesn't really care that much you did a good job and now she'll do something else we'll get another guy in there the UN doesn't matter as an insider what is your take on this it's so funny so I'm in New York because why we fight came out today I'm doing back-to-back media I went on a conservative radio show that was trying to hypothesize is she the author of anonymous is that one and I said on live radio cigars take the tinfoil hat and seriously look look at the body language of the President and Nicky in that oh this is the Oval Office presser you don't get prep I mean Rex Tillerson finds out from a tweet that he's been can okay Nicky gets the Oval Office presser the body language is I respect you I like you you like me you've been a great trooper I got teenage kids I'm gonna take a break now it's look sometimes I know you like them a cigar is just a cigar right it's a very good point it's a very good and you know on the role of the UN which I can't wait until that becomes the Donald Trump residential condominiums in six more years but before they knock it to rubble just tweet it to me they should turn this is turning into a veteran's over VA veteran so the nice that would be so beautiful yeah our veterans deserve water front front news in Manhattan I think certainly more than Iran and China and when you look around at the geopolitical threats one thing I've always loved about you is you speak very bluntly you don't pull your punches and then you you can back it all up and I love it the end of why we fight or the end of why we fight you dedicate a chapter to Whittaker Chambers and I think Young Conservatives don't even know who Whittaker Chambers is they've never read witness why include chambers and what what should conservatives remember from our not so distant past so I put three heroes in there who wore uniforms and their Avena so the books about strategic threats what Donald Trump's going to do about them and then stories about real heroes and I thought to myself hang on you don't have to wear a uniform or carry a gun to be a hero and.and Whittaker Chambers is that man and and and justice Kavanaugh is that man and the really fat I mean I didn't plan this because the book was went to the printers before you know this ordeal he went through but when a kid chambers speaks to what we've just witnessed over the last month because the Democrats have done this before right 1948 this man stood up for the truth he was accused of being homosexual a drunk he was accused of killing his brother all of it were lies total and utter Democrat lies why because the man he accused of being a Soviet agent was a a darling of the Democrat Party Alger Hiss Alger had to be defended at all cost we now have the proof because after chambers died we have the Venona decrypt that his was a Soviet agent but this was 1948 Michael so you know Whittaker Chambers is important because he was Cavanaugh before Cavanaugh was born and it tells you everything you need to know about the Democrats it's so true and that history in particular is so important I'm so glad you included chambers in there because so much of what happened to Richard Nixon comes out of that moment because Nixon believed chambers opposed hiss and I think that's just been lost even to Young Conservatives so I've got to let you go I know you're doing a ton of media you know right now back to back media what should we take away now forgetting about the inner personnel fights in the administration looking at the United Nations looking at all of our geostrategic threats what should we be paying attention to especially as we go into the midterms okay this isn't meant to be flipped but the Donald will take care of all the international stuff I mean he'll just deal with it doesn't matter Russia North Korea China China he'll deal with it I mean the guy is just his strategics intuitive sense is spooky my one message is never give up on him and never give up on on the country he is taking the the brickbats for us he heat stood up for Cavanaugh because he's been through it he's walked through the valley in the last two years everything they've accused him of so the president will never be a neoconservative he's doing what he's doing for love of country my one message is really simple if you like what you've seen in the last two years if you were shocked by what the Democrats did to Cavanaugh get out and vote and get everybody you know who's gonna sit at home to vote because the stakes it's not an exaggeration exaggeration the stakes are more important than anything else you could do in your lifetime right now and while you're going out to vote you should also stop at a bookstore I actually don't think bookstores exist anymore but you know at least stop in your car and order on Amazon or something why we fight it's really terrific it's great to read you should read it before the midterms as you getting your subscription to the other Kingdom that's right that's very important you have to well you're on your phone open up to Windows subscribe another Kingdom coming out this week and why we fight a wonderful book good luck in the media blitz dr. Gork always good to have you here and we'll have to have you back soon don't bless I love talking to that guy you also just want his voice I want to say if I can't do his voice unfortunate work it up I'm I finally been able to do my Mitch McConnell impression so maybe I'll have to work at my doctor Gorka voice still a lot more get to before I do that before we talk about Rand Paul's predictions that someone's gonna be assassinated in this insane hysterical leftist climate and Kanye West prompting CNN to do a minstrel show I've got a second byte of Facebook and YouTube go to daily wire calm why you get me you get the end replevin sure you have a bunch of bureaus show you test questions in the mailbag none of that matters there there are tears of rage that are coming across this country tears of rage tears of rage and if you don't have your fda-approved leftist tears vessel you're gonna drown take precautions now I can only do so much I can only warn you I can't save you if you won't help yourself go to daily wire comm get the pumpkin spice Cory Booker Spartacus spice leftist ears tumblr and we'll be right back Rand Paul is predicting that this insane climate ginned up by the left by Democrats I don't want there to be any confusion I don't think there is any moral equivalence I don't think both sides are to blame I think the left is to blame I think the people who fund the left are to blame like George Soros and others I think the hysterical elected officials of the Democratic Party like Maxine Waters who calls for violence against Republicans and Trump supporters I think the leaders of the Democrat Party who encourage people to chase down Republicans in their restaurants and public spaces in their homes for their children's sleep I think they are to blame they're the ones who are creating this awful climate and Rand Paul is suggesting that somebody might get hurt or killed from this here is people need to realize that when people like Cory Booker's say get up in their face he may think that that's okay but what he doesn't realize is that for about every thousand person that might want to get up in your face one of them's gonna be unstable enough to commit violence when I was at the ball field when Steve Scalise was nearly killed the guys shooting up the ball field and shooting I think five or six people were shot these Glee's was almost killed he was yelling this is for health care he had a list in his pocket of conservative Republicans that he wanted to kill you know when I was attacked in my yard and had six of my ribs broke and pneumonia lung contusion all of that these are people that are unstable we don't want to encourage them we have to somehow ratchet it down and say we're not encouraging that violence is ever okay ever a reason for or a means for trying to resolve things I feel that there's going to be an assassination I really worry that someone is going to be killed and that those who are ratcheting up the the conversation those who are ratcheting up saying getting their face we have to realize that they bear some responsibility of this elevates to violence absolutely right 100% right and it's not I think some people are hearing what Rand Paul is saying they're saying oh well that's hyperbolic rhetoric it's not when it's coming from Rand Paul I mean this guy talk about bad place wrongful at the wrong time this guy was at the Congressional baseball shooting when that lefty tried to shoot up the game he was at we was just mowing his lawn when his neighbor broke six of his ribs really put him down for the count for a long time this is not idle chatter the guy's been attacked twice and his life has been threatened both times and this is a this is a real problem you know there there have been assassinations in this country presidents had been assassinated many presidents have been assassinated have been shot just in the 1960s people were getting shot major political figures were getting shot presidents were being killed there's no reason to think that this can't happen again you know we're in this complacent moment because everything is so easy and our culture is so decadent and everything is so convenient we don't ever have to even leave our couches if we don't want to things can go south real fast you know everything stays pretty nice until it all plummets south real fast and and people are careless with their rhetoric I'm not saying that you shouldn't be strong that you shouldn't say exactly what you think that you shouldn't be perfectly blunt I think you should I'm advocating that much more than mealy-mouthed milquetoast echo not a voice politics but you've got to know what you're talking about you've got to be precise in your language the left wants to be imprecise in its language so that it can encourage hysterical little children to go out and shriek and scream in the gallery of the Senate well Brett Kavanaugh is being confirmed to the court Wow Cavanaugh what have you to do with us Brett of Maryland rah-rah know nobody you shouldn't be doing that you should be act like an adult I mean it is a real immaturity it's a it's a true immaturity here that word hasn't even really been used to describe the left but that's what it is it's an intellectual immaturity a political immaturity and a spiritual immature moral immaturity they don't know that much they're not educated meaning they haven't been brought up the right way and they're not behaving like adults and they really should because children can be can do really reckless things and I hope I hope it doesn't come to that but Rand Paul might have a good point before we end here this is my favorite story of the entire de CNN de basing itself as as best it can and I know that that's a really high bar they have a panel on on Don lemons show and here is look you know Kanye West has stated his political views he likes the president he likes him for a number of reasons he as far as pop musicians and actors and actresses go Kanye West is one of the more thoughtful and articulate of them you know I mean when you listen to like she was who's the girl not a Jap no not Apatow I forget one of those girls though she was gonna run for the Senate I mean she's like screeching and screaming nobody wants that I mean how do you narrow it down to just one Kanye West on the whole actually is in the probably the upper 50% of the pack here is how CNN treats him what happens when Negroes don't read and and we have this now and now Donald Trump is going to use it and pervert it and he's gonna have somebody who can stand with him and take pictures listen black folks are about to trade Kanye West and the racial draft okay they've had it with him and he's an attention whore like the president he's all of a sudden now the the model spokesperson he's the token negro of the of the Trump administration this is ridiculous and no one should be taking Kanye West seriously he's clearly has issues he's already been hospitalized this is what happens when Negroes don't read books that's Don Lemon and then the other people on the panel just going right along with it oh yeah he's the token negro he's the hehehe ha ha and what this amounts to what CNN amounts to is a is a modern-day minstrel show that's what it is that's that's what they're doing they are because what does a minstrel show a minstrel shows when you go on camera you go on stage and you perform a caricature of what your audience expects you to look because of your race because of your gender because if someone else's raise someone else's gender and you play that caricature and you do that soft-shoe well that's what a Negro looks like when he doesn't read books ha ha ha teehee that's what that is it's really it's really despicable because it's so it's so Narrows what people are not just as individuals not just within their communities it it narrows what whole races are it shrinks them it makes them shallow I had this experience I was in New Orleans when I was moving out from New York to Los Angeles and I stopped in New Orleans and I got tricked by some hustler on the street and the guy says he comes up he actually comes up to my buddy and he says hey man I'll bet you ten dollars that I can tell you where you got your shoes both city and state so my buddy I think he bought his shoes in Maine or something he said oh there's no West an easy ten dollars okay yeah okay fine I'll uh yeah you can tell me where I got these shoes city and state I'll give you ten dollars he said you got him in New Orleans Louisiana said no I actually got him in Maine he said no you got him on your feet right now in New Orleans Louisiana ha ha ha you know and my buddy had to pay him 10 bucks and so I was a funny joke so later on were walking through walking down Bourbon Street or something and some guy turns to us and he does this same stick he goes hey man I'll bet you ten dollars that you can't tell me where you got the shoes New Orleans we try blah blah and I cut him off I was like yeah I know where I got my shoes I got him in New Orleans Louisiana no money and and then he dropped the whole show he said okay all right no worries and he starts behaving like a normal person and it was really jarring because the line is pretty funny I'm probably gonna use the line myself you know that I tell you where you got your shoes but it was the it was the performance of it that because this guy you know he's hanging out on the streets of New Orleans he looks a certain way he's a certain age he's in a certain place that he's got to put on a show he's got a he's got a kowtow to a certain line that we expect him to to behave like and that's exactly what CNN is demanding of Kanye West that's exactly what Democrats are demanding that's exactly and it's not a race thing either Oh white white Democrats are demanding this as well they're saying who was it some actress tweeted out a picture and said make Kanye Kanye again he's got to stop being Republican he's got to start he's got to stop being independently minded he's got to start kowtow to the line he black people are supposed to be Democrats that's what we're telling you you have to perform this way it's really narrow it's really shallow and I'm really pleased that a no less a pop icon a pop star that word is abused Icahn but popstar Kanye West is the one who's breaking out of that it was yeah it was Alyssa Milano that's right who's Alyssa Milano who said make Kanye Kanye again he's got to behave a certain way he said he's misbehaving do what we tell you to do behave the way we tell you to behave and CNN is doing the same thing it's a minstrel show it's really really despicable but that CNN isn't it we don't have time for this day in
