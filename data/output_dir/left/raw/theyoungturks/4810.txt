1
00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:01,380
A YEAR AGO

2
00:00:01,380 --> 00:00:03,250
TODAY 49 PEOPLE WERE KILLED IN

3
00:00:03,250 --> 00:00:05,020
THE PULSE NIGHTCLUB IN ORLANDO.

4
00:00:05,020 --> 00:00:07,400
IT WAS THE UNITED STATES MOST

5
00:00:07,400 --> 00:00:14,940
DEADLIEST KILLING EVER.

6
00:00:14,940 --> 00:00:17,730
>> I MISS PULSE.

7
00:00:17,730 --> 00:00:21,759
I MISS
EVERYTHING IT STOOD FOR.

8
00:00:21,759 --> 00:00:22,759
I MISS

9
00:00:22,759 --> 00:00:28,800
SERVING THE LGBTQ COMMUNITY
IN A WAY THAT ONLY A GAY BAR

10
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:30,740
CAN.

11
00:00:30,740 --> 00:00:34,912
I AM GRATEFUL AND COMFORTED
WHEN I SEE YOUR PICTURES OF THE

12
00:00:34,912 --> 00:00:37,720
BEST TIMES OF YOUR LIVES.

13
00:00:37,720 --> 00:00:39,710
IT BREAKS MY HEART THAT YOUR
SANCTUARY WAS

14
00:00:39,710 --> 00:00:42,330
TAKEN FROM YOU, BUT I KNOW WE

15
00:00:42,330 --> 00:00:46,290
ARE RESILIENT AND I KNOW WE
WILL NOT LET HATE WIN.

16
00:00:46,290 --> 00:00:47,630
>> THAT WAS EXTREMELY MOVING.

17
00:00:47,630 --> 00:00:57,579
SHE ALSO HELD A MEMORIAL SERVICE

18
00:00:57,579 --> 00:01:06,119
AT 
THE NIGHTCLUB.

19
00:01:06,119 --> 00:01:09,490
YOU CAN SEE
HERE A PICTURE OF THE LARGE

20
00:01:09,490 --> 00:01:12,329
GROUP THAT MADE A CIRCLE OUTSIDE
THE CLUB.

21
00:01:12,329 --> 00:01:13,659
PULSE HAS BEEN BOARDED

22
00:01:13,659 --> 00:01:21,509
UP SINCE THE EVENT LAST YEAR.

23
00:01:21,509 --> 00:01:25,350
THE SHOOTING LAST YEAR WAS

24
00:01:25,350 --> 00:01:27,329
DEVASTATING BUT IT WAS NOT THE

25
00:01:27,329 --> 00:01:32,560
ONLY TIME THAT THE LGBTQ
COMMUNITY FACED A VIOLENT

26
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:33,560
BACKLASH.

27
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:48,209
LAST 

28
00:01:48,209 --> 00:01:52,039
YEAR WAS ACTUALLY
THE DEADLIEST YEAR FOR MEMBERS

29
00:01:52,039 --> 00:01:57,729
OF THE LGBTQ COMMUNITY.

30
00:01:57,729 --> 00:02:00,229
THIS IS
A TIME WHEN WE ARE SUPPOSED TO

31
00:02:00,229 --> 00:02:05,479
BE MORE TOLERANT AND ACCEPTING,
AND IT IS UNFORTUNATE AND SAD

32
00:02:05,479 --> 00:02:17,200
THAT WE ARE STILL FACING THESE
HATE CRIMES.

33
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:18,200
OBVIOUSLY PEOPLE

34
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:25,110
WITH THE LGBTQ COMMUNITY
ARE TWICE AS LIKELY AS WHITES

35
00:02:25,110 --> 00:02:26,200
AND ABLE BODIES TO BE THE

36
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:37,830
VICTIMS OF HARASSMENT.

37
00:02:37,830 --> 00:02:41,810
JUNE IS
PRIDE MONTH, THAT IS WHY THE

38
00:02:41,810 --> 00:02:45,660
ATTACKER TARGETED PULSE THAT

39
00:02:45,660 --> 00:02:47,430
NIGHT.

40
00:02:47,430 --> 00:02:52,960
AS A WAY TO REMEMBER WHAT
HAPPENED I LIKE THAT SHE IS

41
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:56,660
COMING OUT AND SAYING THAT SHE
WILL MAKE A MUSEUM AND

42
00:02:56,660 --> 00:03:00,049
MEMORIAL FOR THOSE MEMBERS
THAT PASSED AWAY.

43
00:03:00,049 --> 00:03:04,770
>> I WENT BY THE PULSE NIGHTCLUB
A FEW MONTHS AGO, IT IS WEIRD.

44
00:03:04,770 --> 00:03:05,770
I

45
00:03:05,770 --> 00:03:08,640
WAS ON MY WAY TO A PORT TO CATCH

46
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:09,640
A BOAT.

47
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:14,250
IT WAS LATE AT NIGHT,
MAYBE 11 OR MIDNIGHT.

48
00:03:14,250 --> 00:03:15,250
WHILE

49
00:03:15,250 --> 00:03:16,250
BOARDED UP IT WAS SURROUNDED BY

50
00:03:16,250 --> 00:03:21,600
FLOWERS AND A LIVING MEMORIAL AS
TO WHAT HAPPEN THERE.

51
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:22,600
THAT

52
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:23,600
COMMUNITY IS STILL VERY

53
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:26,720
CONNECTED TO THAT PLACE AND
REMEMBERING THAT HISTORY.

54
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:27,720
THE

55
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:28,720
OTHER THING THAT STRIKES ME IS

56
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:45,970
THAT THIS IS A TIME WHEN THE
LGBTQ COMMUNITY IS ñ

57
00:03:45,970 --> 00:03:49,600
NOW WE FIND OURSELVES IN A
SITUATION WHERE THE COMMUNITY

58
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:52,640
IS ON THE DEFENSIVE A BIT.

59
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:55,670
>> I THINK MEMBERS OF THAT
COMMUNITY HAVE ALWAYS BEEN ON

60
00:03:55,670 --> 00:03:56,670
THE DEFENSIVE.

61
00:03:56,670 --> 00:04:07,700
I THINK THAT IS
WHAT WE ARE SEEING IN THE

62
00:04:07,700 --> 00:04:13,560
REPORTING, OR LACK THEREOF.

63
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:15,210
DESPITE THE FACT THAT WITH PULSE

64
00:04:15,210 --> 00:04:21,720
WE SEE THAT PEOPLE OF COLOR WERE
DISPROPORTIONATELY AFFECTED,

65
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:28,910
EVEN IN CERTAIN PRIDE MARCHES WE
STILL SEE LGBTQ FOLKS TO

66
00:04:28,910 --> 00:04:36,620
DE-CENTER WHITENESS, DESPITE THE
FACT THAT INSTANCES OF VIOLENCE

67
00:04:36,620 --> 00:04:39,210
DISPROPORTIONATELY AFFECT PEOPLE

68
00:04:39,210 --> 00:04:43,750
OF COLOR AND FOLKS WHO ARE NOT
ABLE-BODIED OR ARE DIFFERENT.

69
00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:56,600
I THINK THAT IS 
KIND OF

70
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:59,800
WHAT THE RECORD OR REPORT IS

71
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:02,550
GETTING AT.

72
00:05:02,550 --> 00:05:05,560
I THINK IF WE HAVE
MORE COVERAGE WE ALSO FORCE A

73
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:12,130
CONVERSATION AROUND SEXUAL
IDENTITY, RACE AND THINGS THAT

74
00:05:12,130 --> 00:05:15,880
WE NEED TO TALK TO ABOUT.

75
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:27,220
>> I THINK THE PROBLEM IS THAT
THERE IS A CONVERSATION BUT ON

76
00:05:27,220 --> 00:05:32,690
THE WRONG SIDE.

77
00:05:32,690 --> 00:05:34,750
TRUMP IS PASSING
THESE RELIGIOUS LIBERTY

78
00:05:34,750 --> 00:05:36,030
EXECUTIVE ORDERS.

79
00:05:36,030 --> 00:05:43,890
HE IS ALSO NOT
PROTECTING PEOPLE OF COLOR, AND

80
00:05:43,890 --> 00:05:47,370
THE LGBTQ COMMUNITY,
DISABLED PEOPLE ñ THERE IS SO

81
00:05:47,370 --> 00:05:49,389
MUCH OF THIS RHETORIC OUT THERE

82
00:05:49,389 --> 00:05:54,000
THAT I THINK THERE IS MORE OF AN
ACCEPTANCE FOR VIOLENCE AGAINST

83
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:57,390
THEM OR HATE SPEECH AGAINST
PEOPLE WITHIN THESE COMMUNITIES

84
00:05:57,390 --> 00:06:00,220
THAN EVER BEFORE.

85
00:06:00,220 --> 00:06:07,130
WE NEED TO SHIFT IT BACK TO
TOLERANCE AND ACCEPTANCE.

86
00:06:07,130 --> 00:06:10,070
>> BUT THOSE LEGISLATIVE
ROLLBACKS ARE SIGNIFICANT.

87
00:06:10,070 --> 00:06:11,070
IT IS

88
00:06:11,070 --> 00:06:13,230
NOT JUST THE RHETORIC, IT'S THE
FACT THAT THEY ARE REALLY

89
00:06:13,230 --> 00:06:16,230
ROLLING BACK LEGISLATIVE GAINS.

90
00:06:16,230 --> 00:06:19,820
THIS IS A TURNING POINT.

91
00:06:19,820 --> 00:06:20,820
BECAUSE

92
00:06:20,820 --> 00:06:25,730
OF THE RHETORIC AND THOSE MOVES
YOU NEED TO HAVE ANY KIND OF

93
00:06:25,730 --> 00:06:28,290
DIALOGUE OR CONVERSATION, AND IT

94
00:06:28,290 --> 00:06:33,710
IS HARDER TO HAVE IT.

95
00:06:33,710 --> 00:06:37,540
I AM
ACTUALLY EMBARRASSED TO SAY I

96
00:06:37,540 --> 00:06:40,230
HAVEN'T EVEN CONSIDERED THAT
WITHIN AN OPPRESSED COMMUNITY

97
00:06:40,230 --> 00:06:43,760
THERE IS EVEN A MORE OPPRESSED
COMMUNITY.

98
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:45,020
THERE IS A LOT THAT

99
00:06:45,020 --> 00:06:48,320
IS NEGATIVE AT THIS MOMENT IN

100
00:06:48,320 --> 00:00:00,000
TIME.
