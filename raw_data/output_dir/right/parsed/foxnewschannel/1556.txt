MEETING.
IT ALL GOES TOGETHER WITH TRADE
AND CHINA.
>> Neil: BEN, IS HERE WITH US.
WHAT HAPPENED?
>> I'M HERE.
>> Neil: LET ME GET YOUR READ
THEM.
WHERE ARE WE GOING HERE?
WHAT IS HAPPENING?
>> PRESIDENT TRUMP STRUCK THE
RIGHT TONE.
HE'S NOT JUST SPEAKING TO THE
AMERICAN PEOPLE OR THE
JOURNALISTS, HE WAS SPEAKING TO
KIM JONG-UN AND HE WAS SPEAKING
TO THE CHINESE.
THE PRESIDENT UNDERSTAND THE
CARDS, WHETHER THE SUMMIT GOES
THROUGH OR NOT.
KIM JONG-UN IS TRYING TO SEIZE
THE P.R. NARRATIVE.
THAT'S WHAT'S TAKING PLACE NOW.
>> Neil: YOU THINK SOMETHING
HAPPENED WITH THE CHINESE
PRESIDENT TO CHANGE THE STRATEGY
HERE?
>> THE CHINESE ARE ALWAYS
PLAYING GAMES.
LAST FRIDAY THEY LANDED A LONG
RANGE STRATEGIC BOMBER IN SOUTH
CHINA SEA.
>> Neil: AND LAUNCHED A ROCKED
ROCKET TO THE MOON.
>> AND THEY'RE OUTSPENDING US IN
QUANTUM COMPUTING.
THIS IS DANGEROUS STUFF.
I LIKE THE SECRETARY STATE.
ONE THING THAT HAS NOT BEEN
WIDELY REPORTED, AS SOON AS HE
GOT IN THERE, HE PUT A MECHANISM
IN PLACE TO OPEN UP THE BACK
CHANNEL DIALOGUE WITH NORTH
KOREA, THIS IS A SOLID SECRETARY
OF STATE AND IS PACED TO BE ONE
OF THE GREATEST SECRETARY OF
STATES OF ALL TIME.
>> Neil: WHATEVER YOU MAKE OF
THE SECRETARY OF STATE, IF THE
MEETING DOESN'T HAPPEN ON THE 12
MEETING DOESN'T HAPPEN ON THE  2
12th FOR WHATEVER REASON, THEN
WHAT?
>> THAT'S WHAT THE PRESIDENT
SAID TO CONDITIONAL.
I'M GOING TO GUARANTEE YOUR
SAFETY.
YOU CAN BE A RICH COUNTRY.
WE HAVE NOT LOST AN
INFORMATIONAL WAR CAMPAIGN WITH
THE LIKES THAT KIM JONG-UN CAN
NEVER SEEN.
WE CAN TURN OUR ARMY
PSYCHOLOGICAL OPERATIONS LOOSE.
THIS ADMINISTRATION UNDERSTANDS,
LESS THAN A YEAR AGO, KIM
JONG-UN HAD TO HIRE KGB AGENTS
TO TRAIN BODY GUARDS.
HE'S SPEAKING TO THE HOME TEAM.
HE'S HAD PROBLEMS ON THE HOME
FRONT.
>> SO THE PRESIDENT, WOULD YOU
JUST DESCRIBE IT AS LOW BALLING
EXPECTATIONS?
MAYBE THINGS GOT AHEAD OF ITSELF
AND WE WERE GOING
OVEROPTIMISTIC?
>> I THINK HE'S KEEPING THEM
GUESSING.
IT'S GOING FORWARD.
REAL PROBLEM HAS BEEN MADE.
THERE'S NO QUESTION ABOUT IT.
IT'S AMERICAN STRENGTH THAT HAS
GOTTEN HIM TO THE TABLE AT THIS
POINT.
WHAT WE DO OR DON'T DO IS GOING
TO DETERMINE WHETHER OR NOT THIS
PRESIDENT CAN CLOSE WHAT I CALL
THE BIGGEST DEAL OF ALL TIME.
I WANT TO HIGHLIGHT SINGAPORE.
WHEN WE SAY THAT KIM JONG-UN,
YOU'VE GOT A CHANCE TO BE A RICH
COUNTRY, WE SAY YOU CAN BE
SINGAPORE.
IT'S A SHINING CAPABLE OF WHAT
CAPITOLISM CAN DO.
AMERICAN VESTMENT IS FLOWING
THERE NOW.
DUKE MEDICAL UNIVERSITY HAS A
BRANCH CAMPUS.
LET'S PLAY THAT UP AND SEIZE
THAT P.R. INITIATIVE.
>> Neil: OBVIOUSLY THIS LEADER
DOESN'T WANT TO END UP LIKE
MOAMMAR QADDAFI.
WE'VE MADE ASSURANCES THAT
YOU'LL BE FINE, YOUR COUNTRY
WILL BE FINE.
HOW MUCH IS BEING DRIVEN BY KIM
JONG-UN AND WORRIED ABOUT
WHETHER WE MEAN THAT?
>> IT'S REAL.
THE FACT THAT HE HAD TO HIRE TEN
EX-KGB AGENTS TO TRAIN BODY
GUARDS.
>> Neil: ON ANY LEVEL, IF HE
PLAYS HIS CARDS RIGHT, HE WILL
STAY IN POWER, HE'S A KNOWN
MURDER AND BUTCHER BUT THE ONLY
LEADER THEY GOT AND HE WILL
CONTINUE TO LEAD.
>> IF HE REALLY DENUCLEARIZES.
THAT'S WHAT IT'S ABOUT.
>> Neil: DENUCLEARIZE MEANS WHAT
TO YOU?
>> GETTING RID OF THAT
CAPABILITY TO WHERE THEY COULD
HAVE A NUCLEAR DEVICE WITH THE
SUFFICIENT RANGE WITH BALLISTIC
CAPABILITY TO HIT THE UNITED
STATES.
ALSO LET'S SAY THAT THEY DO --
>> Neil: DO THEY HAVE A
DIFFERENT DEFINITION?
>> BIG TIME.
EXPERTS THINK THERE'S 10,000
NUCLEAR EXPERTS AND TECHNICIANS
IN NORTH KOREA.
EVEN IF YOU DO DENUCLEARIZE,
THEY HAVE THE CAPABILITY.
ONLY AN OLD RONALD REAGAN MAN.
TRUST BUT VERIFY.
IT'S GOING TO BE A PHASED
APPROACH.
>> Neil: LET ME ASK YOU, YOU
MENTIONED RONALD REAGAN.
HE WAS WILLING TO WALK AWAY FROM
THE TALKS, IN THE MIDDLE OF THE
TALKS.
HE CAME BACK AND GOT WHAT HE
WANTED.
IS THAT SOMETHING THAT YOU CAN
SEE PRESIDENT TRUMP DO
SOMETHING.
>> CERTAINLY CAN.
HE CONVEYED THAT MESSAGE TODAY.
IF IT DOES HAPPEN, IT DOES.
THIS PRESIDENT UNDERSTANDS ONE
THING.
HIS MOST IMPORTANT
RESPONSIBILITY IS PRESIDENT OF
THE UNITED STATES IS AS
COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF.
KEEPING THE AMERICAN PEOPLE
SAFE.
THAT'S HIS FIRST AROUND FOREMOST
RESPONSIBLE TIP.
HE GETS IT.
>> Neil: WHEN YOU'RE AT A AN
ARMY NAVY GAME, WHO DO YOU ROOT
FOR?
>> I'M AN ARMY GUY.
MANY YEARS AGO, I WAS TRAINING
FOR DRILL SERGEANT.
>> Neil: I CAN BELIEVE THAT MY
MISTAKE.
THANKS FOR SEEING YOU.
