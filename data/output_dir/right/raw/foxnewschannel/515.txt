1
00:00:00,798 --> 00:00:02,766
WE HAVEN'T HEARD THAT YET, SO WE

2
00:00:02,766 --> 00:00:04,001
HAVE TO BE FAIR TO YOU THAT AS

3
00:00:04,001 --> 00:00:04,301
WELL.

4
00:00:04,301 --> 00:00:06,437
LET'S GO BACK TO OUR PANEL

5
00:00:06,437 --> 00:00:08,305
QUICKLY.

6
00:00:08,305 --> 00:00:11,008
CHRIS.

7
00:00:11,008 --> 00:00:13,777
>> WHEN WE SAID THAT SHE WAS

8
00:00:13,777 --> 00:00:17,481
GRILLED BY RACHEL MITCHELL, IT

9
00:00:17,481 --> 00:00:19,450
WAS PRETTY MILD AND A GENTLE,

10
00:00:19,450 --> 00:00:21,585
AND FRANKLY SEEM TO IN A LOT OF

11
00:00:21,585 --> 00:00:21,986
PLACES.

12
00:00:21,986 --> 00:00:23,053
I THINK THE POINT SHE WAS TRYING

13
00:00:23,053 --> 00:00:24,455
TO MAKE AT THE END WHEN SHE WAS

14
00:00:24,455 --> 00:00:27,158
SAYING THE REAL WAY TO DO THIS

15
00:00:27,158 --> 00:00:30,194
IS A LONG COGNITIVE HEARING AND

16
00:00:30,194 --> 00:00:31,829
A CONVERSATION, SHE WAS

17
00:00:31,829 --> 00:00:32,630
BASICALLY SAYING AND YOU DIDN'T

18
00:00:32,630 --> 00:00:34,332
ALLOW US TO DO THAT BECAUSE YOU

19
00:00:34,332 --> 00:00:35,066
ARE GIVEN THE OPPORTUNITY THAT

20
00:00:35,066 --> 00:00:38,269
THE STAFF COULD HAVE, AND MET

21
00:00:38,269 --> 00:00:39,937
WITH YOU AND TALKED IT TO YOU AT

22
00:00:39,937 --> 00:00:42,040
LENGTH, AND YOU DIDN'T DO THAT.

23
00:00:42,040 --> 00:00:43,207
NOW BLASEY FORD SAID I DIDN'T

24
00:00:43,207 --> 00:00:45,043
KNOW THAT YOU ARE OFFERING THAT,

25
00:00:45,043 --> 00:00:46,077
BUT THE WHOLE WORLD KNOWS THAT

26
00:00:46,077 --> 00:00:47,278
SHE WAS OFF FOR THAT.

27
00:00:47,278 --> 00:00:50,081
THAT WAS MADE VERY CLEAR BY THE

28
00:00:50,081 --> 00:00:51,215
MAJORITY, THE REPUBLICAN

29
00:00:51,215 --> 00:00:51,582
MAJORITY.

30
00:00:51,582 --> 00:00:53,151
EITHER SHE OR HER LAWYERS DIDN'T

31
00:00:53,151 --> 00:00:55,853
WANT THAT TO HAPPEN, AND SEEM TO

32
00:00:55,853 --> 00:00:57,021
PERFECTLY HAPPY WITH THIS

33
00:00:57,021 --> 00:01:01,826
FORMAT, WHICH REALLY -- I THINK

34
00:01:01,826 --> 00:01:04,828
THE CHOICE OF THIS LAWYER, THIS

35
00:01:04,828 --> 00:01:05,763
PROSECUTOR, MITCHELL, WHO JUST

36
00:01:05,763 --> 00:01:08,332
DIDN'T SEEM TO UNDERSTAND THAT

37
00:01:08,332 --> 00:01:12,036
YOU CAN SOME BRING UP -- YOU

38
00:01:12,036 --> 00:01:14,372
HAVE TO BASICALLY GO WITH YOUR

39
00:01:14,372 --> 00:01:16,441
HIGH, HARD FAST ONE RIGHT AT THE

40
00:01:16,441 --> 00:01:18,409
START, AND TO TRY TO SHAKE HER.

41
00:01:18,409 --> 00:01:20,778
SHE REALLY NEVER SHOOK HER BASIC

42
00:01:20,778 --> 00:01:21,446
ARGUMENT.

43
00:01:21,446 --> 00:01:22,747
SHE SPENT A LOT OF TIME ON OUR

44
00:01:22,747 --> 00:01:25,216
YOU DEMOCRATIC OPERATIVE?

45
00:01:25,216 --> 00:01:27,018
KIND OF BELIED BY THE FACT THAT

46
00:01:27,018 --> 00:01:29,187
SHE SENT A LETTER TO HER

47
00:01:29,187 --> 00:01:30,455
DEMOCRATIC CONGRESSWOMAN, THERE

48
00:01:30,455 --> 00:01:33,458
ARE A LOT OF REPUBLICANS IN

49
00:01:33,458 --> 00:01:34,225
CALIFORNIA AS IT IS.

50
00:01:34,225 --> 00:00:00,000
BEFORE, AND I WAS EVEN NAMED, I
