Maria: WELCOME BACK. VALORIE JARRETT IS SPEAKING OUT ON WHAT ROSEANNE TWEETED OUT. SHE SAID THAT ROSEANNE IS NOT THE ONLY ONE THAT DESERVES THE BLAME. TAKE A LISTEN. DO YOU FEEL LIKE THIS PRESIDENT HAS SET A TONE THAT HAS MADE PEOPLE FEEL INCREASINGLY EMPOWERED TO SAY THOSE KINDS OF THINGS? THIS IS WHAT I THINK. I THINK TONE DOES START AT TOP AND WE LIKE TO LOOK UP TO OUR PRESIDENT AND FEEL HE REFLECTS THE VALUES OF OUR COUNTRY. EVERY INDIVIDUAL CITIZEN HAS THE RESPONSIBILITY, TOO. Maria: SHE SAID SOME OF IT COMES FROM THE TOP, INCLUDING PRESIDENT TRUMP. WHAT DO SOCIAL MEDIA STARS DIAMOND AND SILK THINK ABOUT THAT? YOU HEARD VALORIE JARRETT. WHAT DO YOU THINK? OF COURSE, I DON'T AGREE WITH WHAT SHE SAID ABOUT BLAMING OUR PRESIDENT FOR WHAT SOMEONE TREATED. FIRST OF ALL, ROSEANNE, SHE'S NOT A RACIST. SHE MADE BAD JUDGMENT WHEN SHE TWEETED OUT SOMETHING THAT WAS A LITTLE OFF-THE-CUFF. SHE APOLOGIZED FOR IT. WHERE IS THE APOLOGY FROM ALL OF THE OTHER PEOPLE LIKE THE JOY BEHAR, WHOOPI GOLDBERG, JIMMY KIMMEL? WHERE ARE THE APOLOGIES FROM THOSE PEOPLE THAT WORK FOR ABC AS WELL? YOU KNOW, WHY HAVEN'T THEIR SHOWED BEEN CANNED? THEY SAID SOME OFF-THE-CUFF STUFF ABOUT OUR PRESIDENT. ABOUT CONSERVATIVES. ABOUT PEOPLE THAT SUPPORT OUR PRESIDENT. Maria: I WAS READING THE KEITH OBERHMAN TWEETS. I COULDN'T BELIEVE THE THINGS HE SAID WITH THE F BOMBS AND THE PUSH-BACK ON PRESIDENT TRUMP. YOU HEARD HOWIE KURTZ MENTION JOY BEHAR. WE HAD TO BLOCK KEITH ON TWITTER BECAUSE HE'S SO NASTY. VERY NASTY. I DON'T GET THE HYPOCRISY. WE'RE GOING TO OPEN THE CONVERSATION. I KNOW VALORIE SAID THIS IS A TEACHABLE MOMENT. IF THIS IS A TEACHABLE MOMENT, HOW ABOUT WE OPEN UP OPEN IT UP. TALK ABOUT RACISM, TALK ABOUT IT ON ONE SIDE. THE WORD "MONKEY", BLACK PEOPLE CALL US THAT. WE NEED TO TALK ABOUT IT ON BOTH SIDES. THIS IS NOT ONE-SIDED. IT'S NOT ONE SIDED. IT'S BOTH SIDES. WE'RE CALLED MONKEYS, COONS, ALL KINDS OF DEROGATORY NAMES. YOU TEACH PEOPLE HOW TO TREAT YOU. EVERYBODY WANT TO BE MAD AT ROSEANNE WHO HAPPENS TO BE A WHITE WOMAN. YOU CALL HER RACISM. WHAT ABOUT OUR BLACK BROTHERS AND SISTERS CALLING OTHERS ALL KINDS OF DEROGATORY NAMES. LET'S TELL THE TRUTH ABOUT THE WHOLE CONVERSATION AND NOT JUST BE ONE SIDED. Maria: SO WHAT DO WE DO ABOUT IT? STOP CALLING EACH OTHER NAMES AND COME TO THE TABLE AND TALK ABOUT IT. I DON'T THINK HER SHOW SHOULD HAVE BEEN A TEACHABLE MOMENT. LET THIS PLAY OUT ON THE SHOW SO WE KNOW HOW TO TREAT EACH OTHER. Maria: FEELS LIKE IF YOU'RE A TRUMP SUPPORTER, THERE'S NO ROOM FOR ERROR. SHE OBVIOUSLY MADE A BIG MISTAKE. AND SHE APOLOGIZED. Maria: THERE'S NO ROOM FOR AIRFER YOU HAVE A CONSERVATIVE MENTALITY. THAT'S NOT FAIR. THAT'S WHAT THE HYPOCRISY COMES IN. THAT'S IT'S GOT TO STOP. SHE'S APOLOGIZED FOR IT. THAT'S THE NUMBER ONE THING. SHE WAS WOMAN ENOUGH TO APOLOGIZE IT. WHEN SHE SAW THE JOKE FELL FLAT, SHE APOLOGIZED FOR IT. WE STILL HAVE YET TO WAIT ON OTHER PEOPLE FROM THE LEFT. WITH WERE ASTOUNDED THEY'RE BEATING THIS LADY UP ABOUT RACISM WHEN THEY'RE THE ONES THAT DOES THE RACISM. YOU'LL SEE SO MANY DEROGATORY REMARKS MADE ABOUT US FROM OTHER BLACK PEOPLE SPEAKING OUT, TALKING ABOUT THIS PERSON IS RACIST. ONE TWEET DON'T MAKE YOU A RACIST. Maria: SO WAS IT APPROPRIATE? WHAT DO YOU THINK HAPPENS WITH ROSEANNE NOW? WAS IT APPROPRIATE THAT THE SHOW WAS CANCELLED AND DO YOU THINK IT GETS PICKED UP BY SOMEBODY ELSE? THE SHOW IS INCREDIBLY SUCCESSFUL. A VERY SUCCESSFUL SHOW. I HOPE IT GETS PICKED UP BY SOMEBODY ELSE IF ABC DOESN'T WANT TO DEAL WITH IT. LISTEN, I THINK EVERYBODY DESERVES TO BE FORGIVEN. YOU CANCEL HER SHOW, THERE'S MORE SHOWS THAT NEED TO BE CANCELLED. WE CAN CANCEL "THE VIEW" AND JIMMY KIMMEL. THEY SAY DEROGATORY THINGS. YOU WANT TIT FOR TAT THAT'S A POINT. JIMMY KIMMEL SAYS I'M A COMEDIAN. SHE'S A COMEDIAN, TOO. SHE WASN'T MAKING A JOKE SHE SAID SHE WAS MAKING A JOKE. I WANT TO GIVE HER THE BENEFIT OF THE DOUBT. THAT'S RIGHT. SHE WAS MAKING A JOKE. SHE APOLOGIZED FOR IT, A COMEDIAN JUST CALLED US BOOT LIQUORS AND COONS. WE TOLD HIM TO TAKE IT DOWN. HE DID. IT HAPPENS. Maria: YOU HAD YOUR CHALLENGES WITH TWITTER IN ITSELF. ABSOLUTELY. TWITTER. YES. YOU THINK THAT'S BECAUSE YOUR CONSERVATIVES? AND WE SUPPORT THIS PRESIDENT. YOU HAVE TO REALIZE HOW HE WON THIS, THROUGH SOCIAL MEDIA. WE USED SOCIAL MEDIA. NOW HE'S THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. THEY DON'T LIKE THAT. THEY'RE GOING TO DO EVERYTHING THEY CAN TO BLOCK US AND STOP US. AND LOOK AT US AS A DOUBLE THREAT. WE'RE TWO BLACK WOMEN, WE LOVE OUR PRESIDENT. WE'RE A TRIPLE THREAT. Maria: IN TERMS OF SOCIAL MEDIA, PEOPLE ARE MOVING SO FAST. THEY SAY THINGS LIKE THIS. YOU KNOW, I HAVE SEEN IT MYSELF. YOU SAY THINGS AND IT'S OH GOSH, WHY DID I SAY THAT? WE SHOULD HAVE MORE FORGIVENESS FOR THAT. HAVING SAID THAT, THERE'S NO ROOM. THERE'S NO TOLERANCE FOR RACIST. THERE'S NO TOLERANCE FOR THAT. ANY KIND OF RACISM ON EITHER SIDE. WE CAN'T ALWAYS POINT THE FINGER AT EVERY WHITE PERSON WHEN MY BLACK BROTHERS AND SISTERS ARE CALLING US OUT. BEN CARSON WAS JUST CALLED A PORCH MONKEY NOBODY SAID NOTHING ABOUT THAT JOURNALIST. EVERYBODY WANTS TO GO OFF ON ROSEANNE. Maria: A JOURNALIST CALLED HIM THAT. YES. DIDN'T APOLOGIZE. YOU'RE RIGHT. CAN'T BE A DOUBLE STANDARD. RACISM IS NOT JUST ABOUT WHITE. IF YOU ARE SPEWING UP, THEN YOU NEED TO STOP DOING IT. Maria: IT'S IGNORANCE ACROSS THE BOARD. ABSOLUTELY. Maria: COMES IN MANY FORMS. ABSOLUTELY. Maria: SO HAVE YOU HEARD FROM ROSEANNE? WHAT DO YOU THINK OF HER RESPONSE? LISTEN, IF IT WAS ME, I WOULD GET OFF AND GIVE IT A BREAK. YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE ON THE DEFENSE ABOUT EVERYTHING. Maria: THE PRESIDENT RESPONDING, JUST TALK TO HOWIE KURTZ ABOUT THIS IS GIVING MORE PEOPLE AMMUNITION TO ATTACK PRESIDENT TRUMP. YOU KNOW THAT. HERE'S THE DEAL. HE MADE PERFECT SENSE WHEN HE SAID IT. ALL OF THESE PEOPLE OF ABC ATTACKS HIM. THAT PRODUCER, WHOEVER THAT WAS, THEY DIDN'T SAY, YOU KNOW WHAT, MR. PRESIDENT? WE ARE SORRY. WE APOLOGIZE ABOUT THAT. THE HYPOCRISY. IT CANNOT BE ONE SIDED AND IT'S ONE-SIDED. I'M HAPPY THAT THE PRESIDENT WEIGHED IN THE WAY HE WEIGHED IN. Maria: BUT THE PRESIDENT IS NOT AFRAID TO SAY, YOU KNOW, LYING TED OR THAT WAS DURING A PRIMARY. CHUCK TODD, SLEEPY EYES. HE'S NOT AFRAID TO THROW IT. THESE PEOPLE HAVE THROWN IT TO HIM. Maria: THAT'S TRUE. THEY HAVE SAID THE MOST DAMNED THINGS. PRESIDENT. IMAGINE IF HE DID THAT TO OBAMA. EVERYTHING WOULD HAVE BROKE LOOSE. AND THE CRAZY THING, THEY DO IT DAILY. ROSEANNE I SHOW CAME ON ONCE A WEEK. THEY DO IT DAILY AND NO APOLOGY. THEY CALL HIM A HOMOPHOBE, XENOPHOBE. THEY DON'T HAVE A PROBLEM SAYING HE'S A RACIST. DONALD TRUMP, OUR PRESIDENT IS NOT A RACISTIC AND THE ONLY COLOR HE SEE IS GREEN AND HE WANTS EVERYBODY TO HAVE SOME. HE'S WANTS US TO BE PROSPEROUS. Maria: BY THE WAY, IT'S HAPPENING. THE ECONOMY IS GROWING. LET ME ASK YOU, BECAUSE OF YOUR CONSERVATIVE VIEWS, YOU'RE LIKE OUT THERE AND YOU'RE UP FOR ATTACK. I'VE WATCHED THIS. HAVE YOU ALWAYS BEEN CONSERVATIVE? WE'VE ALWAYS BEEN CONSERVATIVES IN OUR THOUGHT AND THINKING PROCESS. WE TENDED TO VOTE DEMOCRAT BECAUSE WE WERE CONDITIONED. WE FOUND THAT JUST BECAUSE YOU'RE BLACK DIDN'T MEAN YOU HAVE TO VOTE DEMOCRAT. WE SAY YOU CAN GET OFF OF THAT, THE DEMOCRAT PLANTATION AND VOTE FOR SOMETHING DIFFERENT. WHEN WE SAW DONALD TRUMP NOW PRESIDENT TRUMP, WE WANTED SOMETHING DIFFERENT AND THAT'S WHY WE VOTED FOR HIM. Maria: REALLY INTERESTING. SO YOU SORT OF WENT WITH THE HERD. CONDITIONED. THAT'S RIGHT. WE WERE LIFE-LONG DEMOCRATS. BEING LIFE-LONG DEMOCRATS, THEY TELL YOU THAT YOU HAVE TO VOTE DEMOCRAT. WHOEVER THE HEAD OF THE TICKET IS, THAT'S WHO YOU VOTE FOR. Maria: EVEN IF YOUR LIFE HASN'T CHANGED, IF YOU WEREN'T LIKING THE POLICIES, IF THE POLICIES WERE WORKING AGAINST YOU. THEY SAY STUFF LIKE YOU MAY NOT BE ABLE TO EAT UNDER A REPUBLICAN. THAT GOES ALL THE WAY BACK TO THE JIM CROW DAYS CREATED BY THE DEMOCRATS. YOU HAVE TO KNOW YOUR HISTORY. WHEN WE DID OUR HISTORY ABOUT THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY, IT WAS TIME TO DITCH THEM. THAT'S WHY WE STARTED THE DITCH AND SWITCH MOVEMENT IN SEPTEMBER OF 2015 BECAUSE WE WANT EVERYBODY TO SWITCH TO REPUBLICAN TO VOTE FOR DONALD TRUMP. Maria: YOU MAKE A LOT OF GOOD POINTS, LADIES. YOU THINK THE MID-TERMS WILL BE SUCCESSFUL FOR THE REPUBLICANS? I'M LOOKING FOR THEM TO BE SUCCESSFUL FOR THE REPUBLICAN PARTY. THEY WERE TALKING ABOUT THIS BLUE WAVE AND SEEMS TO BE SORT OF IN THE BACK SEAT RIGHT NOW. BECAUSE OF THE POLICIES COMING OUTS OF THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION, THAT HAS HAD AN IMPACT. VOTE RIGHT OR YOU'RE GOING TO
