“Monster” Cyclone Pam battered the islands
of Vanuatu for almost 24 hours.
Winds nearing 200 miles per hour uprooted
large trees and took down power lines.
Up to 90% of housing in the capital city of
Port Vila is severely damaged.
According to the United Nations, at least
13 people were killed with thousands left
homeless.
Vanuatu’s President says that global warming
“contributed” to the storm.
Other island nations also worry that climate
change will put their entire countries under
water.
