so the reporting restrictions of the case in Leeds have now been lifted this is the case that I was sent to prison for reporting on I'll just point out they haven't been lifted because they were automatically going to be lifted these reporting restrictions would have been on for another possibly 12 to 18 months they've been lifted because the media finally and the only reason why is because I'm in court and Tuesday and they want to be able to report it the media challenged the reporting restriction on the case and I've seen some journalists already already coming out saying this is the one that we couldn't report on though there's no logical reason why you couldn't report on what happened to those young girls there is a logical reason where you couldn't report on the verdict because that could prejudice the next the next group who were facing trial I didn't report on the verdict so I knew the verdicts stay in the case there's like that does not cause any prejudice now what when people this is the breaking news from this case the breaking news from this case that was on Friday afternoon when Judge Marcin automatically sent me to prison he allowed the ten men who have all now been found guilty her all now serving with 220 years he allowed those ten men to go home he had heard a full trial of evidence from 15 children that said the horrific and torturous crimes these men committed against them Judge Marcin let those men go home one of those men sergeant hossain packed his suitcase and is currently in Pakistan sentenced to 17 years in his absence so we've all seen her the judge after hearing evidence against these 10 men after seeing that there was not one witness not one statement but 15 children gave statements the judge made the decision that these men pose no risk to the Brees public not a flight risk or one of them's gone one of them has escaped justice my point on each one of these cases is why are these men with all their links to criminality to drugs to weapons to prostitution to trial trafficking their life of crime why are they allowed to be walking the streets for a year walking in and out court big smiles on their faces awaiting trial why are the victims still left fearful of these men whilst they roam the streets and what now this proves my my can every court case where I was given a suspended sentence was because five Muslim men left their DNA after gang raping a child they know all of their DNA was found at the scene why were they on bail for you why were they still running the same chicken shop still having close contact with children that was my point and my issue with it as a father and as a member of the priests public they are a danger to young girls get them off the street the judge made the decision not to but he quickly locked up pull golden and Jada friends Frandsen yeah he let them one of those men from the canterbury case guess what he went off to Afghanistan okay now this case again this one here judge marcin the case that i was locked up for that the case where i was immediately put in prison with no bail you know no time to go home to my family no time to prepare anything well one of the men Sarge's are saying packed his suitcase and i've known this for weeks by having a neighbor say cuz i've got the transcripts from the court trial and the police say sergeant the same as last steve seen leaving his house with two big suitcases he's been convicted of 17 years in prison and he's escaped justice but turn the turn the table i they acted like he was the danger everyone acted like it the press the media the establishment that the judge i he was the problem i was the danger I needed to take it off the street meanwhile all these men have been convicted they have all been convicted of raping 11 year-old children upwards 15 young girls that's 15 that come forward they have been have been convicted and now the media saying see this is why all acting like they've done a great job this is why we didn't report now you didn't even challenge the restriction you've only challenged the restriction now and I bet my life that there will be no future case that has such a blanket reporting restriction in that way because I hope that the media will challenge it or people will challenge it because why were the public for the last year not allowed to be told their ins and outs and the crimes of this case why couldn't it be publicized why not why not if you don't give the verdicts which I never done which is what they're all saying now the only thing they were allowed to give was the verdict okay so why can't anyone talk about it why can't you even open your mouth without breaking a law that's not freedom that's not freedom of the press that's not free society my my concern lays with preventing these crimes to prevent these crimes every young child and their mum and their dads and this their sisters everyone must understand the complexities of these trials they must understand the common links between every single one of these trials they must understand the signs that their children have been targeted by these gangs they must and it would help if they were publicized to the whole entire world as much as possible not being hidden not all you're gonna get they now you'll get one day's news that's what you'll gain you'll get one day's news bang all the newspapers will think we've done our job we've reported now you could have reported throughout that trial if you challenge the reporting restriction you can avoid the horrific crimes the racial motives the religious motives that they'll come up in all of these trials the comments they make to these children all of the tell-tale signs how they meet the children how they groom the children the signs they play the way they torture them the way they manipulate men manipulate them the way they separate them from their families there's it's a process that happens in every single one of them and there are telltale signs that you you think you can recognize if this was happening to your daughter at the start of it when they've all been nice for the first six months they're being nice Nick buying them new TN trainers and they're buying them presents and new mobile phones all of these signs but anyway the reporting restriction has been lifted and the only reason has been lifted it's because I'm in court on Tuesday that's it nothing else has changed that's it it's not like we can't say again I can't say because there are still certain things people can't say but that's it's been lifted because they want us to try me on Tuesday and send me to prison it's been lifted because then they want to be able to report everything about that but they only challenged it today I ask yourself why the journalists only challenged this reporting restriction today why didn't they why have they challenged it before now and I'll see all the journalists jumping up like oh look up can we done our job no you did them no you did it and no you haven't and you're still trying to bend the fact and again out of those 20 men out the 20 men convicted just just as fits in with the actual facts of all of these grooming trials 90% were Muslim men okay and again 20 or 30% were called Mohammed I'm pretty sure go through the list of names yourself I think there's two non-muslims in the group of 20 okay this is it which is the facts the facts one that this is one of the facts I'm actually being prosecuted by a judge by on Tuesday for stating out that fact unfortunate fact but it's a bloody fact so it winds me up because I think one of these men has gone why was he on bail the briefs public the press why are you know I have you seen any of the press they've all started run their stories have you seen any headlines about how one of these men is escaped justice how one of these men who sentenced to 17 years in prison on the day on the day that I got remanded from that court he was allowed to walk out of court go home pack his suitcase after Judge Marcin had heard six weeks of evidence from 15 victims not one it's not like if there was one girl she could be lying 15:15 evident evidence from 15 women and he was allowed to pack his suitcase and go and I got and go back to Pakistan well done judge Marsden well done and that's my point entirely my point on all of this has been the protection of the British public and the protection of young girls as I said I sent out so I caught one of those men who's just been sentenced of 228 years was still in contact with young English girls young girls anyway he was still in contact in a business he was still working in a business that had direct contact with schoolchildren that's my point so anyway and we'll stop running cuz I'm gonna be having a weekend around my kids but I've just seen it all breaking on the news and I thought why are none of them why none of them making a massive deal out of the fact one of these men they shouldn't have bail why are they owned by a walking the streets I don't get bail we've all seen I didn't get given bail how many other people don't get given bail as so many people don't give given bail these men are have been raping children okay not a bit of crime not selling a bit of gear so I'm not not do anything that raping kids and torturing them and you give them bail and you continue to give them bail and that's my point if you if you hadn't give them bail in both cases let me know need two people to be warned in the public outside your courthouses because they'd be in prison one day where they belong and anyway the report price will be jumping over each other to report probably when I'm convicted on Tuesday but again you all read my statement that I'll read out in court that day you
