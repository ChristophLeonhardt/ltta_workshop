of big news stories out the gate today so we will get to what happened in Pennsylvania's 18th congressional district last night because that actually I have a lot of notes on that but we begin today but this massive walkout that's happening at supposedly 2,500 schools all over America where a bunch of kids astroturfed by pee who organized the women's March have decided to walk out of school for 17 minutes to honor the victims at Parkman it's rather the Parkland school shooting the victims in Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in parkland Florida and of course what this really is is not a call for an agenda right it's not actually a agenda driven march rebel you actually don't know what they want and if you read what the women's March say they are marching for nobody agrees with their actual agenda I'll get to their actual agenda in a second what it really is about is about having a lot of pictures of a lot of young people standing around and saying that they hate gun violence so that a bunch of leftist politicians can claim they are standing with the children in pushing for vast gun confiscation regimes that's what this is all about and that's essentially what the New York Times admits in their editorial today they say the children should lead us which we wish I say fine then what the children take over your editorial board they can't do a worse job than you have fine you just let the kids run all your op eds and they can decide whether they want to run op eds on whether homework is necessary or not it's really funny all the adults at the New York Times we're all in their 50s there they always talked about how wonderful ingenious these seventeen year olds are but I don't see them giving up their jobs anytime soon to high school juniors who are attending Marjory Stoneman Douglas high school but here's what they write in their in their editorial they say adults are supposed to take care of children not only keep them safe but make them feel safe weird I don't hear this from from the New York Times on issues like abortion that adults are supposed to take care of children I don't hear about them with regard to single motherhood that line seems to go out the window but now of course the adults are supposed to take care of children according to the New York Times not by defending kids with guns but by letting kids decide policy which is a weird way of protecting them they say schools are essentially an extension of the home in that sense providing sanctuaries of learning of nurturing and care but after years of attacks by people with weapons of war students cannot feel safe and are demanding that adults end years of complacent and act okay first of all it is the these school shootings are actually on the decline not on the uptick statistically speaking and your chances of being killed in a school shooting are significantly worse than your chances of being killed in virtually any other sort of accidents in the United States and these are acts of terror really say they're not asking for their schools to become armed Garrison's well some would like for there to be more armed guards you say rather they want those weapons to be brought under control I like how the New York Times has a direct link into the minds of all young people it's amazing it's like Russo's general will they just look at young people they magically know that all of Chuck Schumer's proposals on guns I have embedded themselves in the minds of young folks but what is this smack of its max in the New York Times basically taking a child putting the child out front and saying this child demands that you do what I say you do are you going to say no to this very cute child it's like the Pinky and the brain episode where they decide to take over the world by becoming small children with big puppy eyes rather the way to actually become leaders is to show something really cute well that's what the New York Times is basically doing here they say at Stoneman Douglas junior Florence Garrett said at the Florida State Capitol late last month you adults have failed us by not creating a safer place for your children to go to school so we the next generation will not fail our own kids we will make this change happen if not today then tomorrow if not tomorrow next year take it from us you created a mess with us but we will make this world safer for our children again you know I understand that this girl went through something absolutely horrible but the world is significantly safer for kids growing up today than it has been at any time literally in human history and if she thinks that she's gonna be able to ram through gun control because something bad happened to her I have another thing coming for her she was with Wednesday's demonstration and there marched for our lives movement on March 24th in Washington young voices are being heard how will the nation's adult respond hopefully by amplifying their demand never again so first of all I love the use of the Holocaust terminology never again to describe what are rare instances of horrific terrorism and not quite the same thing but as opposed to you know like an organized government effort to slaughter six million Jews not quite the same thing as people who being allowed to own guns because it is their right to do so and then a couple of bad people going and doing really horrific things with those guns not quite the same thing as the Holocaust but all right and then they quote a bunch of high school juniors right and we're supposed to believe that all of these high schoolers are the wisest and greatest among us now again tragedy does not confer expertise I've said this about Jimmy Kimmel and his son just because something bad happened to you in your life does not make you an expert on the underlying issue hi Jimmy Kimmel had a surgeon perform the surgery on his son he didn't perform the surgery himself because he understands that just because he was suffering doesn't mean that expertise goes out the window the same holds true of gun control just because you witnessed something awful happen at your school does not mean you know what you are talking about when it comes to the best public policy to stop such shootings but the New York Times again they want to use these kids as as political human shields and so here is what this is they turn over their editorial page to these and then they quote them right Alfonzo called her own junior no clue no kid should be afraid to go to school no kid should be afraid to walk outside and no kid should have to worry about being shot now that's why I'm marching ok no kid should have to worry about leukemia no kid should have to worry about disease no kid should have to worry about murder no kid should have to worry about anything terrible that's true I mean now that would be great unfortunately we live in a world where there are evil people the question is how do you stop them we all want to stop those evil people okay how about Ali she he not Ally Sheedy right how is she the children of the senior in high school the children you pissed off will not forget this in the voting booth don't doubt the power of the younger generation because we are a force to be reckoned with yeah every young generation says this sometimes they are sometimes they're not but again the idea that everybody who's young is solidly behind a particular gun proposal is just not true my polling emma gonzalez is one of the people who's been featured the most in the media and and subsequently the media have been just enamored of her twitter followers because she has gotten this big twitter bump she went from like nothing to 1.1 million because she was featured on ellen and a bunch of other shows so they quote her maybe the adults have gotten used to saying it is what it is but if US students have learned anything if well first of all if we students have learned anything emma right if you maybe should learn some grammar but if US students have learned anything it's that if you don't study you will fail you should study grammar or you'll fail and in this case if you actively do nothing people continually continually end up dead so it's time to start doing something we are going to be the kids you read about in textbooks not because we're gonna be another statistic about mastery in america but because we're going to be the last mass shooting i fervently wish that this were true I fervently hope that this is true but just because we all want to stop mass shootings doesn't mean I agree with them a Gonzalez's prescription I mean all of this is basically Bernie Sanders style politics I've ripped on Bernie Sanders's Twitter account for a long time because Bernie Sanders his Twitter account is largely Bernie Sanders just saying things like there are rich people and poor people the would should not be like this is it well okay fine but you can do about it and this is the same thing it's there shouldn't be shootings of children yes we all agree now your proposal please I mean Jacqueline Corrine junior high school shouldn't be hashtags every other day Jose Iglesias senior more prayer Jesus God and compassion won't bring back the victims that sadly lost their lives I'm not sure anyone was making the contention that more God was going to bring back children who died it won't bring back the sense of security that my fellow peers and I lost the only way to get that back is through gun control starting now weird because there is significant gun control all over Chicago and people don't feel particularly secure hey gun control doesn't make people feel secure lack of being shot makes people feel secure the only reason that you would embrace gun control over for example more armed security guards is for political reasons so make an argument I love this madison leo the children will become leaders as the leaders have become children I don't even know what that means again and again it's it's it's always selective so the New York Times did turn over one of the one of the editorials on their editorial page to a sophomore at Randolph high school a junior at Toms River North High School and a senior at Marlborough High School all new jersey again this is just political human shield stuff right they're going to bring out a bunch of young kids and then suggest these kids know something better because they are kids which is weird and they right we are generation Zetas in the New York Times the generation after Millennials we outnumber them by nearly 1 million and maybe the largest cohort of future American spenders since the baby boomers we have more than 30 billion in spending power and wield enormous influence and family spending our spending power will only increase as we begin to earn our own wages we will flex our muscles at the ballot box too many high school seniors will cast their first ballots this November and in 2020 a majority of today's high school students will most likely be able to vote in their first presidential election let us remind politicians like Donald Trump Paul Ryan Mitch McConnell who accept donations from the NRA and oppose efforts to restrict gun purchases that we are the future leaders and voters of this country well I'm sure that some of you are and some of you or not I mean there are lots of people who vote there are lots people they don't vote there lots of people who lead there are lots of people who don't there are lots of people who are young who will join the NRA there are lots of people who won't let us remind corporations like FedEx that provide discounts to NRA members and we are their future customers again this is not an argument this is a moral appeal right it's an emotional appeal now the reason that I'm reading all of this from the New York Times is to demonstrate that they're rather selective in the folks that they choose to feature because there are a lot of young listeners to venture pyroshow there a lot of young people who listen to the show something like 70 to 75% of our audience is under the age of 35 with a very disproportionately young audience of which we're very proud and we have tons and tons of high schoolers who listen to this show and I've been getting overwhelmingly one message from my emailers over the last two weeks and they I mean this I'm talking about scores of emails I'm talking about probably more than a hundred emails from high schoolers over the last week alone and today many many more after I wrote this piece Corner saying that they are that they are upset with the media coverage of this mass walkout and asking for advice on how to deal with it I've gotten lots and lots of emails from from these folks so here are some of the emails and I want to read the emails from some of these students who are not going to be featured in the New York Times I want to read some of the emails from these students who are not going to be shown on network news tonight I'll read the emails from some of the students who are going to be ignored and castigated and told that they are worse that they are worse human beings because they disagree with gun control I want to give them a voice because the media the rest of media certainly are not giving these kids a voice and I am speaking with these kids I promise you far more often than the Editorial Board of the New York Times as the editorial the New York Times hasn't talked to a person under the age of 40 except for like this last couple days in years I'm talking to people under the age of 20 every single day because I want to read some of the things that they've been sending to me and let them speak okay so I'm gonna turn over my show to them in just one second but first I want to say thank you to our sponsors over at wonder ease new show this is war okay so there's a new podcast out there from Wonder a podcast network it's

are deeply upset and and deeply angry that there are so many people who are castigating them as bad people because they disagree I mean I'm looking at just in the last hour in the last hour I've received 15 separate emails in one hour before the show from various high school students who are asking about what they should do during these walk outs because they're frustrated and they're upset they feel like they're being ignored here's a high school junior today quote honestly it's like the women's March there's no single consolidated argument just a loose collection of rants that obscure the main point from a sixteen-year-old high school girl quote I was planning on not participating in the walkout I do not see the point in leaving class to simply walk outside stand and talk with peers for 17 minutes and return to class the act of walking out of class to protest school violence does not seem to have a target audience even though they may have a news crew it is doubtful the students in Florida will see the actions of our schools walk out as a stand with solidarity I also support the Second Amendment and I see this walkout as another opportunity for students and their parents to attack that Amendment and I support again my and my opposition to gun control I do see that my refusal to participate may be seen as unsympathetic or cruel my brother who's a freshman is being pressured in class to participate from a 17 year old high school student tomorrow my school is having a walkout at 10 a.m. for the 17 students who were killed in parkland Florida shooting the walkout however here at my school is not really about that it is being promoted by an anti-gun leftist political agenda that I just don't and can't support especially using the 17 kids that were my age as a platform I was wondering what you would say to people who want to call me insensitive and a terrible person I mean my initial response to that is anybody who calls you insensitive and a terrible person because you disagree on political matters is insensitive and a terrible person hey here's from another 17 year old high school student the reason I'm emailing is because my school is having a walkout on March 14th they say in an e-mail that this walkout is to advocate for gun reform but they also say that we are walking to honor the victims of the Parkland massacre I'm in favor of walking to honor the victims but not in favor of promoting gun reform I feel like I have to choose between going against my political values or looking like a bad person I need help what do I do I'm getting emails like this literally minute by minute now from another high school or my high school is participating in the walkout on Wednesday I am unsure what to do I'm very against gun control I don't want to protest Congress for something they're doing right if that makes sense however I don't want to be singled out by students as someone who quote doesn't care about the students who died should I participate and conform to avoid humiliation and honor the students or should I remain in class alone I don't know if the walkout is more about gun control or honoring the students I mean I could literally do this all day I could really do this all day here's one that came in in the last four minutes okay hello my name is I'm gonna leave out his name and and his class because I don't want to get in trouble is I saw your tweet about the unheard conservative students and it is very relatable there was a walk out of my school today a large majority of the students sat in the gym instead of walking out this is school about 1800 people fortunately my school would not allow protests of liberal students had to mascot as a memorial but the motives were still very much apparent the local media only covered the minority of the students participating in the walkout I have a question as to how to get my own and my conservative peers voices heard can you post about that or something related to that sometime please I'm happy to talk about it right now this is in the last 10 minutes okay these are all emails from the last 10 minutes alone I'm not even screening them I'm just pulling them up from my mailbag right now this guy this guy is an in Anthony's has been first let me say I'm a big fan of the show on the website second I'm a 16 year old sophomore in Philadelphia our scoot student council in collaboration with our school administration organized and walk out today to remember and pray for the victims of the recent shooting however in my opinion this walkout quickly shifted into a walkout for gun control similar to the walk outs occurring across the nation we thankfully had the option to choose to change died which I did as a Catholic I stayed inside and said a prayer for the victims of the shooting however I refused to go outside to protest gun control because I'm a proud Second Amendment supporter I believe we have the constitutional right to bear arms and therefore it shall not be infringed upon just thought I would share my story regarding this walkout again thanks for your mail I'm getting these things like they're coming in faster than I can actually read all of them because there are tons of them coming in over and over and over and all this and and here is the thing right and here's the thing the media won't read you any of these emails because the media wants to promote this agenda the media wants to suggest that the only reason in the world that you would not walk out with these students is because you hate the students and you don't care about the students and by the way we support gun control now in a second I'm gonna talk about the suppose it agenda of this gun control walkout in a second I'm gonna talk about that so let's let's jump right on the women's March is organizing this first of all the women's March is organized by some of the worst people on earth three of the four people who are women's March co-chairs are open supporters of Louis Farrakhan and still the women's March has not really disciplined them the women's March is not to motive them though these these three people have not come out and apologized for their support of Lewis Farrakhan the women's March put out sort of a ridiculously vague statement about how they want to be tolerant but they didn't go any further than that the women's March is a group of radicals who like to obscure their message by suggesting that you have to walk out in support of women or have to walk out in support of children but here's what they're actually something for so if you actually go to the women's march website and they have something called hashtag enough national school walk out our demands hey you can't demands anything it's a democracy you can elect people who do what you want but your demands are going to fall on deaf ears because it's just you shouting at the wind with media support here are their demands quote demand one banning assault weapons and high-capacity magazines in this country there's a fine line between wanting to be protected and wanting to intimidate others it's all in the title assault weapons don't protect they harm and too easily these deadly weapons can be bought sold and distributed within the borders of our nation how can we enjoy freedom if our own country condones the selling of deadly military-grade reference weapons which threaten our very existence the right to bear arms should not be the right to kill no one says you have the right to kill you idiots and the notion that assault weapons are even a definable category is ridiculous you know what a military-grade arm is any rifle ever hey those are all military-grade because at some point in history all rifles have been used for military purposes but I guess that we're supposed to pretend that this makes any sense demand to expanding background checks to all gun sales with one in five gun purchases being a no-questions-asked purchase dangerous people have the ability to easily purchase guns from private sellers at gun shows over the internet and even through magazines in states that don't require background checks well this is again I'm a statement of law the statement is that if you're going to buy from a federally licensed firearms dealer over the internet at a gun show or anywhere else you have to go through a federal background check the well-researched connection between a history of domestic violence and gun violence combined with expanded background checks could have prevented much of the gun violence we experience in this country we know states that required background checks on all handgun sales or permits had 35% fewer gun deaths per capita than states without that background check requirement well I don't know where you are getting that particular statistic and I would like to I haven't had a chance to actually vet that's this is that comes from the Giffords Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence but I think that you know these statistics do not bear out that one factor in a multifactorial analysis explains the states that have fewer gun deaths per capita right that that background check on handgun sales is that you'd have to explain that there are a bunch of people buying privately and then shooting people again those statistics are not available as a general rule the Man three passing gun violence restraining order to law made this one I actually support right this one they say time and time again we hear people commenting on how they saw it coming or always knew it be him gun violence restraining orders would provide a consistent and localized system for people to provide reasonable suspicion to local courts resulting in the expeditious removal of guns from those showing signs of potential to harm themselves or others followed by due process okay nothing first of all that is a wild misstatement of the law at the very end that the the due process comes after the seizure of the guns no the new process comes before the seizure of the guns and then the due process continues after the seizure of the guns oh yeah but the then they get to the final one and this undermines all their others right demand for stop militarizing law enforcement act in 2017 there were only 14 days when police didn't kill someone so it's important that when we talk about gun violence we not forget state sanctioned gun violence that disproportionately impacts black or brown communities black people make up 13% of the US population yet constitute one-quarter of those killed by police hey now I mentioned here black people also constitute one half of all murder victims in the United States and approximately half of all murderers in the United States this is not a statement about race being implicitly tied with violence but so long as you are citing race in connection with violence statistics it's important to note that police actually statistically undershoots minority people they don't overshoot minority people if you actually connect that with the levels of violence occurring in the minority community this act would slow the process of turning our neighborhoods into war zones by preventing the police from having the weaponry and equipment of invading armies so here's the hilarious parts they want to disarm everyone presumably leaving all of our safety in the hands of the police and then they want to disarm the police who do you think is actually gonna disarm all those people do you think that it's gonna be a bunch of unarmed people who walk up to two armed people in Texas and take away their guns do you think that when a school shooter shows up if the police don't have weapons they're gonna go in we've been told by these same people that a guy with a handgun can't even go up with a guy against the guy with the ar-15 if that's the case then why would you possibly want to disarm the cops but this is what the women's March is it's a radical radical group and it gets even better I mean at some point in here they actually talk about how they want to oppose international violence or something like that this is an agenda driven March masquerading as a as a broad statement of sympathy for students I hate that sort of conflation because it's just not true okay in a second I'm gonna move on to Pennsylvania 18th and I want to also give a piece of advice to all the students who are experiencing the walk outs today but first I want to say thank you to our sponsors over at helix leap so as I've said many many times I am very bad at sleeping there's particularly true when I'm on the road because I miss my helix sleep mattress helix sleep gives you something that does not exist anywhere else a mattress personalized to your unique preferences and sleeping style that won't set you back thousands of dollars you go to helix sleep comm /ban when you take their simple two to three minutes sleep quiz they build you a custom mattress and that will be the it's the best thing you've ever slept on it really is fantastic with a more fantastic mattress in our room we moved it out because the helix sleep mattress is better for couples they'll even personalize each side of the mattress and here's the best part you can try it for a hundred nights and if you don't love it they will pick it up and refund you in full okay the custom mattress arrives so right to your door in the week shipping is completely free unpack it from package it automatically inflates it and it's ready to go go to Hilux sleep calm / bed right now you got fifty dollars toward your custom mattress that's helix sleep calm / Ben 50 bucks order custom mattress again helix sleep calm / Ben for 50 bucks off your order there's a lot of more expensive mattresses out there and they're not as good helix sleep calm / Ben make sure that it's personalized make sure that it is made just for you that's what helix does helix sleep comm / menus that / Ben you get 50 bucks toward your custom mattress plus it lets them know that we saw you okay so for all those students who are asking what they should do during this walkout given all the propaganda that's surrounding the walkout here is my answer right my answer is that the my answer is that you should go to the walkout so that you're not perceived as uncaring and you should bring with you a sign and the shine should say my and the sign should say something like I care about I care about children's lives I care about my life protect my life arm teachers right protect my life arm law-abiding people protect my life more school security right put your message right out there show that you can do both it's like I said at CPAC everybody in the room at CPAC most of the vast majority from her second amendment support is very strong you know I said to them raise your hand if you care about what happened in parkland every hand goes up and I said raise your hand if you care about the Second Amendment every hand goes up the media seem to want to believe that these two things cannot coexist they do coexist show that they coexist go to the walkout and carry us saying he stand with the Second Amendment and you stand with the kids the media will ignore you but at least you'll have made your point I think that's sort of important ok so last night the other big news aside from the impending school walkout was the results from the pennsylvania 18th congressional district so Connor lamb apparently has won that seat or apparently it looks like he's going to win that seat he is the Democrat in that district that district went to Donald Trump by 20 points 20 okay and it has flipped all the way Democrat this makes just another data point in a dataset that is really really bad for conservatives according to fivethirtyeight.com in the seven special elections that have taken place since 2016 there's been an average swing in favor of Democrats of 16 points hey the way they're measuring that swing is they average the differences between how this constituencies in these particular districts voted and how the country overall voted in the last two presidential elections so the average swing has been 16 points there was a thirty one point swing for example in the Alabama US Senate race in which doug jones ended up becoming the senator the democrat ended up becoming the senator the same thing happened in Pennsylvania last night there's a 20-point swing in that race okay this is not good news for Republicans it's actually very bad news for Republicans pretty obviously and Republicans are trying to make all sorts of excuses for this they're trying to explain why this is not such a big deal one of the explanations is put forward by Kaley mcenany who's a big Trump fan big Trump acolyte and she says listen Conor lamb won because he was basically running as a Republican Connor Lam has essentially run as a Republican he's pro-gun he says he's personally pro-life he says he's Pro coal he's Pro tariffs he's anti Nancy Pelosi imagine that the Democratic candidate who's against Nancy Pelosi the Minority Leader he has made himself into essentially a Republican so you have a Republican and named and a Republican and truth running against one another okay so you know this is the argument is that it's really not a big deal because Connor Lam is basically Republican McConnell M is not a Republican he's a pro-abortion Democrat he says he's personally pro-life but he is in favor of abortion being legalized all the way across the board he is not pro gun control so he opposes gun control this is not an argument that Republicans are gonna do well in 2018 it's an argument that if Democrats are not stupid and they run people tailored to their districts they will do better right if they're on John Assaf in the Georgia sixth District if they run a Nancy Pelosi fan who's not from inside the district they're going to lose if they're on Doug Jones who is perceived as moderate in Alabama even though he is not if they were on Connor lamb who's perceived as moderate in the Pennsylvania 18th then they will win so the argument here is not that Republicans are doing fine because this Democrat ran a conservative campaign the point is a Democrat just one who caucus with Democrats in a district that no Republican has lost no Republican has lost in 20 years and no Republican has won by fewer than 15 points in the last 20 years they just lost that district now listen there were some factors moving against the Republicans in this district Tim Murphy was the former congressman who stepped down he stepped down specifically because he had knocked up his mistress and then he had told her to get an abortion then he had to step down that's never good for the Republican who's gonna have to step in but in their art +20 district that really should not make a difference there are a lot of bad signs for Republicans here the reason I'm saying this is not god forbid celebrit ory I don't want Republicans to lose the house I think it'd be terrible as I've said many times on the show for Republicans to lose the house because I think the Democrats would then start passing all sorts of bills and I think President Trump would be sorely tempted to sign a lot of those bills I'm not sure that Trump is gonna stand between the Democrats and their policy priorities if he thinks he's gonna get some good headlines out of it particularly if he can swivel to the middle I think and give Democrats a bunch of things they want and get about I don't you're good headlines Trump likes pleasing the people who are in the room with him is I'm very perturbed by the possibility of a Democratic Congress but and it's fairly obvious at this point the Democrats do have a major enthusiasm advantage again in those seven special elections in 2017 Democrats gains an average of 16 percent last night they gain 20% just over 2016 so in a year like one year that district shifted by 20 points and one of the reasons for that is obviously the Republican enthusiasm is really low there's only 60 percent of the turnout that they got in 2016 Trump isn't on the ballot this time so you know off your elections are usually bad for the president in power but there's sort of regression to the mean that said Trump's unpopularity doesn't help right Trump actually went and campaign for Rick Ciccone didn't make one bit of difference not one and here's a war statistic for Republicans this is an hour plus 20 district they're 118 seats held by Republicans that Trump won by fewer than 20 points there were closer districts than this district now does that mean Republicans are gonna lose 100 seats no it doesn't mean that Republicans will win the vast majority of those seats but Democrats only need to pick up 24 seats in order to win the house so you have to say at this point that statistically speak in a data-driven way they are the favourites to pick up the house which means House Speaker Nancy Pelosi god help us okay second point here Trump's popularity does actually matter so there's been a lot of talk a lot of loose talk about the idea that Trump can be as unpopular as he wants to be polls don't matter his base will support him his base will get out there and vote his base is not big enough to win congressional elections it just isn't his base was not big enough to win a popular vote and congressional elections are gonna look a lot more like a popular vote than they are like the electoral college because again they're within smaller districts right the electoral college means that if you win the state of Florida by one vote you win all of their electoral votes but congressional districts are much more localized so that means that national polling you know these sort of generic congressional ballots they do matter all right if there's a generic congressional ballot that shows the Democrats are up by about nine which is where they're saying it is right now Democrats win back the house in a pretty easy walk Trump's popularity is a drag here my presidents with low popularity ratings depress turnout for their own side and from as a gift for increasing turnout on the other side at least now the Democrats realized that he could be President the reason that the Democrats instructable for Hilary's because Hillary was awful but also because they believed it was a foregone conclusion that Hillary's gonna win and they believe that if they stay at home it would make a difference Hillary was gonna walk over Trump by 10 points but they were wrong and I don't think they're gonna make that mistake again so Trump had better pull his pull his plummeting popularity ratings out from out from the sewer Democrats are also as I say running better candidates Connor lamb is a much better candidate than John Asaf like rent lamb ran it is true as a soft Republican but you know the fact that he ran is a soft Republican demonstrates the Democrats may not be quite as stupid as the intersectionality Laden politics they've been promoting would suggest which is you know devastating for Republicans we've been hoping that Democrats are going to basically you know cave in on themselves they will they will run the worst candidates in human history again and again and again and again they will in some districts but not in all districts and you can't count on them making this many mistakes you just can't so you know all of this is bad news I want to talk a little bit more about that in just a second I also want to talk about my friend steven crowder being suspended from Twitter and apparently from YouTube also which is just absurd I'm gonna talk about all that in just a second but first you're

subscribe please leave us a review we are the largest fastest growing conservative podcast in the nation all righty so there are a lot of people who just want to ignore the data in Pennsylvania 18 there are a lot of people who want to believe that everything is going to be fine there are a couple factors cutting against this Trump actually has got one pretty well but his actual governance has been pretty decent for the first year we got a big tax cut the economy is doing pretty well all those things are true he still just lost a district right seconded just lost a district that was our plus 20 and from visited that district all of which is to suggest that things are not going to get better for president Trump and not unless President Trump makes a market shift and how he approaches politics which is very unlikely at this point because the economy is booming like what could get better at this point really what what could what policy wise for all those policy wonks who think that everything's gonna get better this was supposed to be one of the districts that was going to love president Trump's tariffs right this is a Pittsburgh suburb this is the area that Trump was going to bring back steel manufacturing with tariffs and Republicans just lost it so what does that say it says that Trump is about at the high-water mark of what he can do politically to help himself the economy is doing really well there isn't any major foreign crisis on the map we're not involved in a long-lasting war outside of Afghanistan which has been going on at low levels for the last 20 years nothing has happened that would drive from Sapru Ville writing into the toilet right there hasn't been an economic collapse like killed george w bush's last term and there hasn't been anything like that so what is Trump supposed to do policy-wise the answer is nothing which means a lot of this is personality it means that Trump is going to have to stop kind of emitting this odor of chaos he's gonna have to stop with the with the troll Lorie I think he's gonna have to unite from proceeded into the background if Trump just became part of the part of the wall the part of the wall paper I think the Democrats would have a harder time getting their turnout out the reason they're getting their turnout up is because people dislike Trump in the same way that Republicans disliked Obama but probably more so it helps Republicans in 2010 that Obama that Obama was the president and it will help Democrats since once he 18 that Trump is that is the President of the United States again I can like a lot of what Trump is doing and also recognized that he is a political liability in a lot of these districts there's a report out today that only two Republicans across the country actually want Trump to campaign with them again that's not unique to Trump and people who are saying well look that's just cuz Trump's terrible there were a lot of Democrats who didn't want Obama anywhere near them in 2010 in 2012 and 2014 in 2016 right didn't want Obama putting the stink of his presidency on them then what Obama you know spending his days blathering about gun control and health care reform and then coming to their districts where they were running a really narrow race well the same thing can hold true for Trump that a lot of Republicans may not want the the stench of Trump on them and so they're trying to avoid him but Trump demands loyalty and so if you don't show enough loyalty like they're stuck between a rock and a hard place at least Obama had the brains to recognize that if Democrats didn't want to campaign with him that was probably because they thought they were gonna lose and he needed them in the Congress Trump is the kind of guy who if you say I don't mr. president love you I don't need you in my district it's gonna be a problem for me if you say that's a president Trump there's a solid shot that within five minutes he's on Twitter blasting you as disloyal and suggesting that you be primary so Republicans are sort of stuck between a rock and a hard place on Trump but listen not all of this is about Trump again there's an average loss of you know 20-plus seats in these congressional off year elections but it does not help when people insist that data doesn't matter that polls don't matter then nothing matters I did just because the polls were off on the state level in 2016 does not mean that all polls are fake the national polls in 2016 were actually pretty close to the money the polls last night in Pennsylvania were very very close they said this was a dead heat it wasn't dead heat the races separated for like a thousand votes so before we just start ignoring data because it is convenient to us to ignore data then you know I think that we should probably look at that data and analyze whether or not any of this is is a good idea okay so quick note on my friend Stephen Connor so my friend steven crowder has now been suspended from Twitter for violating its hateful conduct terms he's apparently also been suspended from YouTube which is insane right so now they they posted an X out by Southwest video of spend computer infiltrating a gender-fluid panel when Twitter suspended Stephens account so they've said that he needs to delete the tweets that violate the rules they've suspended the account for 12 hours okay here's what what Crowder's website is saying here's what we think happened the original video that went out didn't have the word bleep it's it's the the F word for forgave people soft bleep the original video was immediately pulled from YouTube Twitter and Facebook as the studio team added bleeps for the offensive content after the bleeps were added into the video the studio reuploaded the south by south southwest undercover video back to YouTube and Facebook when knocking Jared shared the video with the bleeps added an information blurred he was also suspended which means Twitter didn't find that word offensive they've found the general concept of the video offensive so what what exactly is the video so apparently the video is fun computer right a fake character who is forced to crash an LGBTQ gender nonconformity meetup at South by Southwest ok this this tape has now been removed from YouTube it's just a comedy video alright it's typical Crowder alright Crowder's the guy does tranny Bane alright this is his shtick he's a comedian comedians do lots of stuff that walks right up to the edge and sometimes crosses over the edge this is a reason that you're gonna be banned from Twitter suspended from Twitter Louis Farrakhan is tweeting openly and Lewis Farrakhan is tweeting openly and he's met a crap on Twitter every single day he's not been suspended and his counterparts on the right people like Richard Spencer who I even hesitate to call of the right you know Richard Spencer who is who is you know so the white version of Louis Farrakhan inverse right Richard Spencer has been suspended from Twitter I don't think he's on Twitter anymore I think he's been banned from Twitter the same thing holds true of my lowly innopolis now I'm not in favor of any of these people being banned from Twitter even though I despise all but I think that it is completely absurd that steven is getting knocked off these platforms because Steven happens to be a conservative comedian where if you were a left-wing comedian and you said exactly the same words about Christians everything would be totally fine you said the same words about Jews everything would be totally fine this double standard that exists in social media is really dangerous it's one of the reasons why Facebook YouTube Twitter and Google all of these outlets seem to be targeting conservative content right now conservatives better get on their horse I mean we better start building some of our line outlets because the reality is that if we don't build some open thread outlets if we don't build some open source outlets that allow people to post what they want to post with some very very minut restrictions then the left will simply castigate everything as hate speech okay this is one of the things that's been so funny in the recent couple of weeks but left keep saying well you know no you know you're worried about crackdowns on free speech on college campuses you're worried about intolerant leftist but if you look at the polls people on campus say they're for free speech right but those same polls show that these people say that they are against what they call racist speech but the problem is they then define racist is anything they disagree with so you have a definitional problem that's very serious yeah the same thing is happening to Crowder here lumping in Crowder with milo gianopolous or lumping in christina hoff sommers with Richard Spencer and some people on the Left are trying to do is just absurd it's insane it's happened to me also it's disgusting if you're not gonna make any sort of honest intellectual distinction between these categories then you don't deserve to have a platform your platform should fall apart right jack over its Twitter get on here and get on your game dude I mean this is just it's just ridiculous there's no excuse for it whatsoever all right so I mean while President Trump is is he decided to inspect the border yesterday so he comes and he inspects the border wall here is what it looked like when he inspected border wall prototypes in San Diego president Trump there in San Diego California taking a look at the border wall prototypes in the meantime I just want to let you know that more than 400 firms submitted proposals to be included here six companies built a total of eight prototypes the prototypes you can see a lot of them there in the background are 18 to 30 feet high okay so Trump goes and visits the prototypes the purpose of this of course is to show the Democrats that he's serious about building the wall even though we have not had one foot yet built of the wall the president then talked a little bit about the wall and for some odd reason it started talking about the Jamaican bobsled team or the Mexican mountain climbing team like really this is the thing that happened the larger it is the better it is because it's very hard to get over the top it's really deterrent from getting over the top who would think who would think but getting over the top is easy these are like professional mountain climbers you're incredible climbers they can't climb some of these walls some of them they can those are the walls were not using okay mr. president thank you for that dissertation on the climbing capacity of Mexican illegal immigrants just just well done don't even know what's happening there that was not the only weird thing that Trump said yesterday he also pushed what he called the space for so he he floated the idea of creating a new military branch to fight wars in space now to be fair to President Trump he's not the only person who has actually mentioned this before this has been mentioned by a number of legislators the idea of creating a space force but it is kind of funny when Trump says it so here he is space is a war fighting domain just like the land air and sea we may even have a space force develop another one space force we have the Air Force while the space force we have the army the Navy you know I was saying it the other day cuz we're doing a tremendous amount of work in space I said maybe we need a new force we'll go with the space force and I was not really serious and then I said what a great idea maybe we'll have to do that that could happen that could be the big breaking story look at all those people back there look at that what exactly is happening I'm what now a space force well the good news is the President Trump is already cut a commercial for space force here's what it looks like young people from all over the globe are joining up to fight for the future I'm doing my part they're doing their part are you join the mobile infantry and save the world service guarantees citizenship there it is bed of course is from a starship trooper so the President of the United States promoting space force okay fine whatever it it's probably not the worst idea in the world actually so there's that okay meanwhile the president is breaking news in the last few minutes the president the United States about to appoint as the head of his National Economic Council I the the the famed free trader Larry Kudlow which just goes to show you that Trump really doesn't have policies he just has people he likes so Larry Kudlow is basically Gary Cohn except his name is Larry Kudlow so Gary Cohen you're recall was ousted from the National Economic Council head he was supposed to be the guy who stood up to Trump's anti-free trade agenda and he stepped down after Trump said that he was going to push forward with his steel and aluminum tariffs Kudlow has been an ardent fruit trader for years he says that free trade is the bulwark of the international system Trump's appointing him to replace cone which is a really weird pick i listen i like larry cudlow i think that larry cudlow is correct about all of this here's the report from CNBC president Donald Trump plans to name Kudlow as his top economic adviser sources told CNBC Trump could announce his decision is to choose Kudlow as his National Economic Council director as soon as Thursday the CNBC senior contributor and honored personality will replace Gary Cohen who left the White House earlier this month amid disagreements about tariffs on steel and aluminum imports now I can't imagine that Larry is gonna go in there and that he's immediately going to turn into a tariff fanatic that he's suddenly going to turn it into Peter Navarro it is good news I mean this is this means the Peter Navarro isn't the head of the NEC which would just be a disaster but it is pretty astonishing when the Trump is willing to appoint somebody who disagrees with him on all the policy because he saw him on TV which basically is what it sounds like here it sounds like that that's exactly what it sounds like it sounds like there is some sort of there's some sort of personal relationship between Trump and Kudlow and so he's gonna have Kudlow as part of his team which is again not the best way to foreign policy this just breaking and that Kudlow has accepted the job and the alert is out on the Washington Post so that is pretty that is pretty hilarious okay another hilarious news Katy Perry is responsible for a me-too moment so Katy Perry is a judge on the new American Idol and there's a guy who sang for her he is a virgin who's never been kissed his name is Benjamin glaze he's a 19 year old kasher from Enid Ohio and apparently he and apparently he sang beautifully on American Idol and Katy Perry loved it so much that she came over and kissed him right on the lips right moments before his audition and said instead it came to Sochi it wasn't even after he sang he said it was a tad bit uncomfortable his first kiss was rite-of-passage he didn't put him off with consideration he said I wanted to save it for my first relationship I want it to be special what I have done it if she said would you kiss me no I would have said no I know a lot of guys would be like heck yeah but for me I was raised in a conservative family I was uncomfortable immediately I wanted my first kiss to be special the scene with the kiss was part of a two-night season opener for the new American Idol which is now on ABC after it was kicked off of Fox and the new panel of celebrities is a Katy Perry Lionel Richie and Luke Bryan and it's hosted by Ryan Seacrest in the segments that featured mr. glaze he was shown waiting around anticipation for his audition with other hopefuls as he entered the studio guitar slung over his shoulder lookin a bit starstruck he said he enjoyed his work as a cashier because it let him eat cute girls and have you kissed a girl and liked it asked Mr Bryan making a quite reference to Miss Perry's first hit single I kissed a girl mr. glaze said that he had not and he said I've never been in relationship I can't kiss a girl without being in a relationship and then she stood up and she said come here right now and then she said one on the cheek and she and she smiled and then she asked for another kiss complaining he had even made the smush sound as he moved toward her cheek again miss Perry swung her face toward him and kissed him quickly on the lips and then she raised her arms and victory okay a me-too moment that no one will care about because obviously even though the contestant was not into it even though he didn't want it Katy Perry is a hot liberal so we're allowed to pretend that that's all okay yep that's the way that it works imagine that had been a conservative dude doing that to a virginal feminist and imagine how that would have gone the answer is it would it would not have gone okay time for a couple of things that I like and then we'll get to some things that I hate so things that I like today there is a brand new book out called the escape artist from my friend Brad Meltzer and and Brad Meltzer is a is a terrific author I mean he's written thrillers before it's been several years since he wrote a thriller so this is first thriller in quite a long while he's also the author of bunch of books I've recommended on the program for kids I am George Washington I am Jackie Robinson I'm Martin Luther King these are really great books for children my four-year-old loves them so I had the opportunity to sit down with Brad the other day and and here's what it sounded like so joining us on the line in a rare things I like interviews Brad Meltzer Brad is the author of a number of best-selling thrillers as well as books that I've recommend on the shows many times actually the I M George Washington I am Abraham Lincoln children's series all about historical American figures he has a new book coming out its first new thriller in years and it's called the escape artist Brad thanks so much for joining us appreciate it thank you my friend so Brad what exactly is the escape artist about yeah you know the escape artist opens with NOLA Brown one of my favorite characters I've created years and Nola's dead government says she's dead she's a staff sergeant who died in a military accident a plane crash but at Dover Air Force Base when our hero Zig is laying the body to rest he opens it up and sees that there's a hidden note inside her stomach and the note says NOLA you were right keep running and he realizes Nola's not dead she's alive she's on the run and she's the escape artist and for me that's the fictional plot that's what drives the book but what I love is that it's based on real details so I was on a USO tour a number of years ago entertaining our troops and found out about Dover Air Force Base of course knew that Dover was where our soldiers are fallen soldiers are laid to rest what I didn't know is Dover is home to our absolute top biggest cases so whether it's 9/11 and the Pentagon flight or the Space Shuttle going down or our top spies around the world they go to Dover - and that means Dover is a place that's built on secrets and mysteries and you'd originally apparently heard the story that there were actual notes found in the bodies correct so this is this is so that's based on actually a true thing that you'd heard yeah no I was I always take my plot and I give it to the real person and the people at Dover they just blew me away I was humbled I mean I've done research at the White House and with Presidents Bush and it you know it's been an amazing experience but when I went to Dover I'd seen nothing like it they will spend 14 hours rewiring someone's jaw because they want them to see their son or daughter one last time they'll rebuilding an entire hand because a mother specifically says I want to hold my son's hand one more time and so I gave these amazing people my heroes I was like we need heroes like this in the world I wanted to make them the heroes of this book of the escape artist and I gave them the plot I said could you hide her note in a body and they told me that if a plane was going down this is true that if you ate the note at the right time and the note went down into your stomach the liquids in your stomach would actually protect the note and I thought no that's a cool story and what they said was it's not just a story it happened on 9/11 and I said what are you talking about they said on 9/11 this is true one of the victims on the Pentagon flight when they opened up their stomach there was actually a note inside and I said you know Ben let's be honest what's the question right there what he gotta ask ya what in what what snow and I mean that's crazy what's the note right I mean that's it we've never been closer I was like what's the note and of course they couldn't tell me and I respect the privacy of it I thought it had to be someone in the military because who else would have the wherewithal to do such a thing but as I look back on it I realized that person was doing what we all do and we all want is seeking connection right we all want to love and be loved and to me one of my parents died the one good thing that happened was I got to say goodbye and I remember they said to me this is like the ultimate message in a bottle and the reason I take hope from that note is that when you put that message out there you're gonna be heard and that's the plot of the book I literally all I did was just change the fact of what was on the note and said you know you're alive keep running and I made it sexy for a thriller but I always base my books on real research well the book is the escape artist the author is Brad Meltzer again I highly recommend the escape artist I also recommend all of his children's books as my daughter does she is actually even a bigger fan of Brad Meltzer than I am Brad thanks so much for joining us and thanks for taking the time out I really appreciate it thank you brother really appreciate it all righty so there is a thing I like go out and check out Brad Meltzer's a new book again it's called the escape artist and it is well worth the read it's really interesting and quite a good book okay other things that I other things that I like today so there's a book that is very popular in term conservative intellectual circles but is not well-known called the revolt of the masses called abaya Jose Ortega y Gasset now this is written in 1926 I believe and it was all about the problem of having an undifferentiated population that is interested in overthrowing the established order and it was specifically written about the rise of Marxism it's a pretty sophisticated book it also talks a lot about the balance between democracy and a republic and balance between you know elites and and the masses and whether you actually do need people who know what they're talking about at the top but how do you avoid tyranny if that's the case so check it out revolt to the masses by Ortega ego set okay time for a quick thing that I hate alrighty so Eminem found it necessary to go off on the NRA I don't know what Eminem is trying to do at this point I know he's trying to escape being irrelevant and so I guess the way he thinks he's gonna do that is ripping into the NRA all this all these people clutching their guns etc etcetera etcetera I have a bit of bad news for mister mm what is actual name is Marshall Mathers correct yeah so yes I have some I have some bad news for mr. Eminem in 2001 he was sentenced to probation for gun charges right he was apparently he the gun was not loaded nor was it directed at anyone but the rapper pled guilty to a concealed weapons count on February 14th 2001 and also he had had all sorts of problems with run-ins with the law including weapons he got two years probation on gun charges back in 2001 so well done mm yeah just just well done it again all the virtue signaling by all these artists who are running out of steam and so now they're looking for the approval of the critics in the hope that this will boost their profile a little bit they need to make a headline again it's it's sort of pathetic and it demonstrates though like when was the last time that Beethoven when Beethoven was alive was he like you know what I need to make a political statement now in order for people to like my art was this true of Brahms as it's true of Mozart was this true of the big band swingers in the 1940s this is true for any of the great jazz artists I don't think so it's only now when pop culture and politics have completely emerged that we're supposed to pretend that pop artists have something deep to say about the nature of politics and then we cheer for them and then we're supposedly supposed to go by their their crappy records if they say something nasty about the NRA okay we'll be back here tomorrow the news is breaking fast and furious and we will have all of the updates I'm Ben Shapiro this is the Ben Shapiro show the Ben Shapiro show is produced by Mathis lover executive producer Jeremy boring senior producer Jonathan hey our technical producer is austin stevens edited by alex and Garo audio is mixed by Mike Carmina hair and makeup is by Jesuit Oliveira the Ben Shapiro show is a daily wire for word publishing production copyright for publishing 2018
