1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:01,360
We need to get the hell out of here.

2
00:00:03,820 --> 00:00:07,519
The premise of the movie Gravity is that
space debris hits the International

3
00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:11,340
Space Station, it causes utter
destruction which is a little unrealistic,

4
00:00:11,340 --> 00:00:15,620
but that scenario is
actually what people are scared of.

5
00:00:21,260 --> 00:00:24,560
My name is Amber Yang I am 19 years old.

6
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:27,320
And I am a physics major college student

7
00:00:27,329 --> 00:00:31,660
at Stanford University, I'm also the
founder of Seer Tracking.

8
00:00:31,660 --> 00:00:32,369
So we take the

9
00:00:32,369 --> 00:00:36,059
data of current satellites and
spacecraft and try to predict if there

10
00:00:36,060 --> 00:00:38,100
will be any collisions with space debris.

11
00:00:38,660 --> 00:00:42,260
So space debris is any defunct man-made

12
00:00:42,260 --> 00:00:47,260
space part or spacecraft, that is
orbiting in low-earth orbit right now.

13
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:52,320
They can be as small as a paint fleck to
as big as a completely dead satellite.

14
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:57,980
And they often travel as fast as 17,500
miles per hour and you can only imagine

15
00:00:57,989 --> 00:01:02,519
with something traveling that quickly
that its impact on another orbiting

16
00:01:02,519 --> 00:01:04,160
object will be extremely large

17
00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:05,500
and will cause lots of damage.

18
00:01:05,780 --> 00:01:06,720
This space debris

19
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:10,799
could have such a big impact on
essentially the success of the American

20
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:15,380
space program and mankind's advancement
into space technologies.

21
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:17,640
I watched this

22
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:20,775
series of videos that astronaut Scott
Kelly published,

23
00:01:20,775 --> 00:01:22,110
he would have to duck into

24
00:01:22,110 --> 00:01:27,040
the Soyuz capsule which is an adjacent
capsule to the International Space Station,

25
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:31,380
because there was fear that the
spacecraft that he was in might be hit

26
00:01:31,380 --> 00:01:32,360
by space debris.

27
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:34,050
We're just inside one minute from the

28
00:01:34,050 --> 00:01:35,780
time of closest approach.

29
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:39,860
It first became like an issue around the

30
00:01:39,860 --> 00:01:45,420
1950's and really in the past few decades,
that number has only skyrocketed.

31
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:51,650
There is a concept that, as the space debris
collide with other space debris and

32
00:01:51,650 --> 00:01:52,500
other objects,

33
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:56,280
that fragmentation will
cause even more space debris to occur.

34
00:02:00,180 --> 00:02:08,380
Currently the method for tracking space
debris is extremely inaccurate at times,

35
00:02:08,380 --> 00:02:11,700
because the orbit of space debris
changes so quickly.

36
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:12,880
The method that I

37
00:02:12,890 --> 00:02:17,209
have introduced is using artificial
neural networks and artificial

38
00:02:17,209 --> 00:02:19,340
intelligence to track space debris.

39
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:28,240
It will provide a prediction, it will say

40
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:32,500
I think this is where the space debris
will be in this future point in time.

41
00:02:32,820 --> 00:02:37,540
And if we find the actual point in time in
the future where the space debris is and

42
00:02:37,550 --> 00:02:41,180
there is an error metric between the
artificial neural network and where the

43
00:02:41,180 --> 00:02:42,480
space debris actually is,

44
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:45,769
we can tell the
neural network that oh you're wrong by

45
00:02:45,769 --> 00:02:47,000
this amount.

46
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,630
I am basically allowing the
artificial intelligence to learn the

47
00:02:50,630 --> 00:02:55,160
patterns of how the space debris
positions are changing over time and it

48
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:59,820
will keep training itself until its
predictions are actually very very accurate.

49
00:03:01,020 --> 00:03:04,360
The primary concern would be
for things already orbiting in space and

50
00:03:04,370 --> 00:03:09,739
trying to allow these things orbiting in
space to have enough time to move out of a

51
00:03:09,739 --> 00:03:10,520
collision's way,

52
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:13,440
If my software predicts
that there would be a future collision.

53
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:17,290
Another thing that it could be readily
used for is predicting when is the best

54
00:03:17,290 --> 00:03:20,719
optimal launch time for things like NASA
and SpaceX,

55
00:03:20,719 --> 00:03:22,500
when they're trying to find

56
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:28,049
a time window where to launch their
rockets and other space cargo. They want

57
00:03:28,049 --> 00:03:30,980
to look at a window where there isn't a
lot of space debris.

58
00:03:30,980 --> 00:03:32,430
Right now a lot

59
00:03:32,430 --> 00:03:36,180
of people are putting space debris on
the back burner, they're saying it could

60
00:03:36,180 --> 00:03:40,230
be potentially very dangerous someday,
but right now it's not that big of a

61
00:03:40,230 --> 00:03:44,120
concern because we haven't really had
any casualties yet.

62
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:45,750
But the very

63
00:03:45,750 --> 00:03:50,609
terrifying version of the Kessler
syndrome would be a space atmosphere so

64
00:03:50,609 --> 00:03:54,419
trashed, that you couldn't launch
anything up without it being hit by

65
00:03:54,419 --> 00:03:55,580
space debris.

66
00:03:55,580 --> 00:03:59,099
The whole goal is that
we're trying to preserve our Earth, our

67
00:03:59,099 --> 00:04:02,970
atmosphere for future generations in
front of us and in order to keep

68
00:04:02,970 --> 00:04:05,820
developing technologies that will
succeed and go to space,

69
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:15,800
Thanks for watching.

70
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:17,960
