announcement but first some context back

3
00:00:06,210 --> 00:00:09,269
in 2006<font color="#E5E5E5"> I first discovered that YouTube</font>

4
00:00:09,269 --> 00:00:10,800
was more than just a platform for

5
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:13,710
uploading video<font color="#E5E5E5"> between the fabric of</font>

6
00:00:13,710 --> 00:00:16,199
these audio visual experiences was an

7
00:00:16,199 --> 00:00:19,859
online community small but vibrant and

8
00:00:19,859 --> 00:00:22,260
so for the next<font color="#E5E5E5"> 10 years I began</font>

9
00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:24,210
experimenting increasingly becoming

10
00:00:24,210 --> 00:00:26,010
enthusiastic about this tool that

11
00:00:26,010 --> 00:00:28,289
connected people globally where ideas

12
00:00:28,289 --> 00:00:30,330
could<font color="#E5E5E5"> be discussed and creation shared</font>

13
00:00:30,330 --> 00:00:32,579
having helped organize<font color="#CCCCCC"> the first UK</font>

14
00:00:32,579 --> 00:00:34,680

15
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:36,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">that online get-togethers could become</font>

passion because I truly believe that

<font color="#E5E5E5">online community is one of the best</font>

there who<font color="#E5E5E5"> supported me over the years I</font>

have been<font color="#E5E5E5"> possible but during</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font>

51
00:01:51,750 --> 00:01:53,189
period I have often been asked by

52
00:01:53,189 --> 00:01:56,490
friends colleagues and viewers miles why

53
00:01:56,490 --> 00:01:57,990
don't you make videos more often and

54
00:01:57,990 --> 00:02:01,259
honestly it's because of time when I

55
00:02:01,259 --> 00:02:02,790
worked<font color="#CCCCCC"> for the YouTube network channel</font>

56
00:02:02,790 --> 00:02:05,100
flip I thought my time was better spent

57
00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:07,200
using my knowledge of the platform to

58
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:09,690
help hundreds of youtubers as opposed to

59
00:02:09,690 --> 00:02:13,379
helping just one ie me and when I was at

60
00:02:13,379 --> 00:02:13,830
the media

61
00:02:13,830 --> 00:02:16,320
<font color="#CCCCCC">zation</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> guardian they were saying why</font>

62
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:17,700
aren't you making videos if you're

63
00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:19,920
interested<font color="#E5E5E5"> in journalism and education</font>

64
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:22,530
and it was because I'd rather<font color="#E5E5E5"> help the</font>

65
00:02:22,530 --> 00:02:24,420
organization and hundreds of journalists

66
00:02:24,420 --> 00:02:27,090
transition to the video platform well my

67
00:02:27,090 --> 00:02:28,980
time at the Guardian recently came to an

68
00:02:28,980 --> 00:02:31,260
end and so I find myself<font color="#E5E5E5"> at a crossroads</font>

69
00:02:31,260 --> 00:02:33,960
in life a moment to reflect on what's

70
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:36,210
important to me what do I want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do</font>

71
00:02:36,210 --> 00:02:37,890
next and the answer to<font color="#E5E5E5"> that first</font>

72
00:02:37,890 --> 00:02:40,140
question<font color="#E5E5E5"> I could probably break into</font>

73
00:02:40,140 --> 00:02:43,530
three<font color="#E5E5E5"> categories there's activism online</font>

74
00:02:43,530 --> 00:02:47,100
community and being an educator the last

75
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:48,750
10<font color="#CCCCCC"> years on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> YouTube has been a difficult</font>

76
00:02:48,750 --> 00:02:50,970
transition for me I guess you could<font color="#CCCCCC"> call</font>

77
00:02:50,970 --> 00:02:53,340
it growing up but as I became more aware

78
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:55,290
of the potential of this platform I

79
00:02:55,290 --> 00:02:57,630
steered away from entertainment videos

80
00:02:57,630 --> 00:02:59,970
and more towards one's about serious

81
00:02:59,970 --> 00:03:02,910
issues and projects and consequently I

82
00:03:02,910 --> 00:03:04,740
became less included in the mainstream

83
00:03:04,740 --> 00:03:07,110
YouTube community I helped build<font color="#E5E5E5"> from</font>

84
00:03:07,110 --> 00:03:09,630
the start but that's just life things

85
00:03:09,630 --> 00:03:11,940
move on unfortunately over the recent

86
00:03:11,940 --> 00:03:14,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">years i have made new connections with</font>

87
00:03:14,490 --> 00:03:17,190
people that make me<font color="#CCCCCC"> feel like i'm home</font>

88
00:03:17,190 --> 00:03:19,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">again so thank you and so today</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

89
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:21,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">consider returning as a regular video</font>

90
00:03:21,900 --> 00:03:24,209
blogger but to do that I need your help

91
00:03:24,209 --> 00:03:26,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">and so I'm launching a patreon account</font>

92
00:03:26,370 --> 00:03:28,950
for this YouTube channel that doesn't

93
00:03:28,950 --> 00:03:30,900
mean a<font color="#CCCCCC"> pay wall for my video content I</font>

94
00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:33,030
always<font color="#E5E5E5"> want that to remain free to view</font>

95
00:03:33,030 --> 00:03:35,160
and share but what it does mean is for

96
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:36,780
any of you out<font color="#CCCCCC"> there who believe in the</font>

97
00:03:36,780 --> 00:03:38,820
work I do that you have<font color="#CCCCCC"> an opportunity</font>

98
00:03:38,820 --> 00:03:41,519
to support<font color="#CCCCCC"> me directly in the last</font>

99
00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:43,290
couple of years I've had a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> people</font>

100
00:03:43,290 --> 00:03:45,720
on my videos on live streams even when

101
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:48,120
I've been gaming saying can i donate to

102
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:49,590
you somehow and I've always said no

103
00:03:49,590 --> 00:03:51,150
because it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> just been on such a random</font>

104
00:03:51,150 --> 00:03:53,670
occurrence and so I thought why not

105
00:03:53,670 --> 00:03:56,040
organise something like this so<font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

106
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:58,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">how it works in a nutshell you can visit</font>

107
00:03:58,170 --> 00:04:00,780
my patreon page and pledge five ten

108
00:04:00,780 --> 00:04:03,330
twenty dollars a month however much or

109
00:04:03,330 --> 00:04:05,070
little you'd like and you become a

110
00:04:05,070 --> 00:04:07,709
Patrian every week<font color="#CCCCCC"> I will produce a</font>

111
00:04:07,709 --> 00:04:10,140
video for this YouTube channel and I

112
00:04:10,140 --> 00:04:11,670
will<font color="#E5E5E5"> also host a live stream for my</font>

113
00:04:11,670 --> 00:04:14,010
patrians where we can discuss upcoming

114
00:04:14,010 --> 00:04:17,010
video ideas and concepts issues

115
00:04:17,010 --> 00:04:19,680
discussed on previous videos and world

116
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:21,839
events and causes I am someone who

117
00:04:21,839 --> 00:04:23,729
believes no one has a monopoly on good

118
00:04:23,729 --> 00:04:25,650
ideas and so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a fantastic</font>

119
00:04:25,650 --> 00:04:27,490
opportunity for

120
00:04:27,490 --> 00:04:29,319
me to work closely with those of you out

121
00:04:29,319 --> 00:04:32,289
there who support what I do I have some

122
00:04:32,289 --> 00:04:34,360
<font color="#CCCCCC">very ambitious plans for the future and</font>

123
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:37,690
trust me I mean ambitious but we need to

124
00:04:37,690 --> 00:04:39,759
<font color="#E5E5E5">take this one</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> step at a time so right</font>

125
00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:42,220
now I'm trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> figure out how much</font>

126
00:04:42,220 --> 00:04:44,169
time<font color="#E5E5E5"> I can afford to dedicate to this</font>

127
00:04:44,169 --> 00:04:46,569
channel each<font color="#E5E5E5"> week I've not yet set many</font>

128
00:04:46,569 --> 00:04:48,220
goals or rewards because I driver

129
00:04:48,220 --> 00:04:50,370
build-up to this just one step at a time

130
00:04:50,370 --> 00:04:54,340
but may 27th will be my 10-year<font color="#E5E5E5"> YouTube</font>

131
00:04:54,340 --> 00:04:56,199
anniversary and I'm going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> use that as</font>

132
00:04:56,199 --> 00:04:58,270
a date to review how this Patrian

133
00:04:58,270 --> 00:05:00,490
project is going and determine whether

134
00:05:00,490 --> 00:05:02,050
or<font color="#CCCCCC"> not this is something</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> am</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> able to</font>

135
00:05:02,050 --> 00:05:04,240
continue I have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> admit it does feel</font>

136
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:05,860
we're discussing this but I have to be

137
00:05:05,860 --> 00:05:07,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">honest with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you and logistically</font>

138
00:05:07,690 --> 00:05:10,330
speaking if I<font color="#CCCCCC"> could just get 50 of you</font>

139
00:05:10,330 --> 00:05:12,250
out there<font color="#E5E5E5"> to donate ten dollars a month</font>

140
00:05:12,250 --> 00:05:14,680
I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that this could be the start of</font>

141
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:17,080
something very very special and I hope

142
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:18,759
many of you out there will join me on

143
00:05:18,759 --> 00:05:21,039
this journey however if you are<font color="#E5E5E5"> not able</font>

144
00:05:21,039 --> 00:05:23,560
to or don't agree with that I completely

145
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:25,360
respect that but<font color="#CCCCCC"> hopefully you can</font>

146
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:27,159

154
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:46,810
