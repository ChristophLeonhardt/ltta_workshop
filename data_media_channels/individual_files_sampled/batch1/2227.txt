hilary is so corrupt she got kicked off the Watergate Commission how corrupt you have to be to get kicked off the Watergate Commission Michelle Obama gives a speech and everyone loves it it's fantastic my wife Melania gives the exact same speech and people get on her case and I don't get it Hillary accidentally bumped into me and she very civilly said pardon me and I very politely replied let me talk to you about that after I get into office I wasn't really sure if Hillary was going to be here tonight because I guess you didn't send her invitation by email or maybe you did and she just found out about it through the wonder of WikiLeaks we've learned so much from WikiLeaks for example Hillary believes that it's vital to deceive the people by having one public policy and a totally different policy in private that's okay I don't know who they were angry at Hillary you arrived but Donald really is as healthy as a horse you know the one bladder more potent rides around down looking back I've had to listen to Donald for three full debates and he says I don't have any stamina that is four and a half hours I have now stood next to Donald Trump longer than any of his campaign managers people look at the Statue of Liberty and they see a proud symbol of our history as a nation of immigrants a beacon of hope for people around the world Donald looks at the Statue of Liberty and sees a four maybe a five if she loses the torch and tablet and changes her hair
