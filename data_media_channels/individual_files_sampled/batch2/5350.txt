they decide for money power politics today we're talking about something that impacts yours truly every day the disconnect that directly affects American families a recent article from the Atlantic asks the question why does the school day end two hours before the work day / each according to that report the mismatch in schedules for parents and their kids which is to the two hours between 3:00 and 5:00 p.m. could be costing the United States economy fifty five billion dollars in lost productivity carabao joins me now she wrote that article for The Atlantic Kara I can't tell you how many mothers sent that to me I sent it to them it was a wild circle because not only does school end at 3 p.m. if you are a working mother there is basically no one out there for you to hire who wants a job for two hours to watch your kid so walk me through the balance here is it a simple shift of changing schedules because when you look at school budgets you could say man schools can't possibly to afford to stay open another two hours but when I think about all of those families out there with a parent that can't afford to go to work that's a really good point and I think that one of the people I spoke with for this story Katherine brown at the Center for American Progress she talked a little bit about talking about town tax bases and thinking about you know if we had a program after school that pretty much everyone needed and everyone wanted to participate in I'm sure we could try to offset a cost that way the family I spoke with for this story the wenzels they ended up having to pay somewhere around 300 to 400 dollars a month in private childcare and trying to find someone to watch their kid after school when they weren't able to get into an after-school program that was provided by their town they're trying to find someone who taught yoga in the morning and who was flexible during those really weird hours of the day so in terms of a solution I think you know there's a lot of factors at play I think a lot of schools have busing schedules they have to accommodate they have to accommodate after-school programs like sports but I think you know in terms of finding a financial solution certainly something that takes into account the fact that most families need a solution is something that everyone should consider let's stay on that after-school program issue because according to the nonprofit group after school Alliance the 19 million kids in this country not enrolled in after-school programs because there's not enough spots and if you think about what many of those programs are Sports extra extra school help creative arts those are things that would really help so many kids so is the issue we've got to find the funding for more programs I think funding is certainly a big piece of it and also space the problem in the South Windsor town in Connecticut that I profiled for this piece they had plenty of people who are interested in the program plenty who are willing to pay there wasn't enough physical space in the town to host these kids safely the solution they ended up finding was they asked two local religious institutions if they would be able to take the kids and have a YMCA program operate out of them so I think that costs for a lot of communities especially communities in urban areas it's a big concern and I think that there's a lot of grant funding available that doesn't necessarily find its way to the right people but also just the ability to have kids safely run around after school in a supervised place I mean there has to be a way to accommodate them you also quote a researcher who believes this is contributing to the wage gap because so many mothers cannot go back to full-time work and we haven't even factored in the fact that kids have off the entire summer exactly in lost wages is a huge piece of this in this in my piece I mentioned that this is a problem for you know 75 percent of mothers work with school-aged children seventy-five percent and trying to figure out a way to have you know a full-time job a career to advance in one's career and to do all of the things that one wants to do as a parent as a mother you know already I think it's a tremendous amount of stress but I think you know a lot of families make the choice to have a parent not work in half of families even in 2018 that's a choice a lot of families make I know for the family I spoke with to this story the woman chooses to skip her lunch so that she can accommodate picking her kids up off the bus and dropping them off at school so you know I I think that we're gonna see a lot of people you know doing more and more to help accommodate parents in the future well thank you so much I know a lot of women who leave the workforce simply because childcare in this country is so expensive and they can't make enough money and at the same time pay someone to help care for their children after school it's a complicated issue I certainly don't know the answer but I know that when people say hey it's just about maternity leave and now we've added paternity leave we got this kids at home for at least 18 years it's more than 18 weeks hey there I'm Chris Hayes from MSNBC thanks for watching MSNBC on YouTube if you want to keep up to date with the videos we're putting out you can click subscribe just below me or click over on
