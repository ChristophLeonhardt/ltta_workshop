THANKFULLY NO ONE INJURED.
THEIR KIDS.
THE AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT TAKING
AWAY ABOUT 21 U.S. DOLLARS EVERY
TWO WEEKS FOR EACH CHILD NOT UP
TO DATE WITH THEIR REQUIRED
VACCINATIONS.
BUT HOW SHOULD WE REGULATE
VACCINES IN THE U.S.?
MOTHER AND ATTORNEY, THANK YOU
FOR BEING HERE.
AS A FATHER I HAVE DECIDED TO
VACCINATE ON THE BASIC STUFF.
I RECOGNIZE THE RIGHT FOR
PARENTS TO HAVE THAT RIGHT FOR
THEIR CHILD.
WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THIS
POLICY?
>> THERE ARE REASONS PARENTS CAN
OPT-OUT, RELIGIOUS REASONS,
MEDICAL REASONS OR PHILOSOPHICAL
REASONS.
AUSTRALIA IS DOING.
WE DON'T WANT TO WAIT UNTIL WE
HAVE A LARGE OUTBREAK OF SOME
DEADLY DISEASE LIKE MEASLES OR
SOMETHING THAT COULD AFFECT THE
POPULATION AS A WHOLE.
I UNDERSTAND THE PARENTS
CONCERNS BUT DON'T WANT MY CHILD
GOING TO SCHOOL WITH KIDS THAT
AREN'T VACCINATED.
I THINK THE UNITED STATES SHOULD
>> CARLA, FINES, MAKING IT
ILLEGAL IN AUSTRALIA?
FAMOUSLY AMERICA IS A PLACE OF
FREEDOM, OF CHOICE.
I BELIEVE IT IS A DEBATE OVER
GOVERNMENTAL CONTROL.
I BELIEVE AS A PARENT I HAVE THE
RIGHT TO DECIDE TO VACCINATE OR
NOT TO VACCINATE MY CHILDREN.
I DECIDED TO VACCINATE MY THREE
VACCINE CALLE
VACCINE CALL E
VACCINE CALL ED
VACCINE CALL E
VACCINE CALLED
VACCINE CALLED GA
VACCINE CALLED GARD
VACCINE CALLED GARDAS
VACCINE CALLED GARDASIL
VACCINE CALLED GARDASIL.
I'M THANKFUL I HAVE THE PARENTAL
RIGHT TO OPT-OUT OF THAT.
I BELIEVE LIMITED GOVERNMENT IS
REALLY BEST.
I THINK WHEN GOVERNMENT PLAYS
THE ROLE OF THE PARENT, THEY
PLAY A TERRIBLE ROLE IN
PARENTING.
WE'VE SEEN THAT HISTORICALLY
AND I'M MORE CONCERNED ABOUT THE
THAT.
WE NEED TO PROTECT OUR CHILDREN
FROM A LOT OF THE OUTBREAKS THAT
WE'RE SEEING THAT HAVEN'T BEEN
HERE FOR DECADES.
YOU LOOK AT IT FROM SORT OF A
PHYSICIAN'S VIEW, HOW IMPORTANT
ARE VACCINATIONS, AND DO YOU
HAVE TO MANDATE THEM FOR THEM TO
BE EFFECTIVE?
>> I DO BELIEVE WE HAVE TO
MANDATE THEM.
WHAT HAPPENED IN OUR COUNTRY IS
WE HAVE ABSOLUTE FAILURE OF OUR
RATES DROPPED IMMENSELY,
OUTBREAK OF MEASLES IN
CALIFORNIA IN 2015.
THESE BECAUSE PARENTS WERE
MAKING DECISIONS THEY WEREN'T
PREPARED TO MAKE.
SOMETIMES YOU HAVE TO TRUST YOUR
PHYSICIAN.
CHOOSING YOUR DOCTOR IS A BOND
OF TRUST.
IF YOU COME TO ME AND SAY YOU
BUT THE VACCINES BECAUSE I DON'T
REALLY THINK YOU ARE RIGHT ABOUT
VACCINES THEN YOU DON'T TRUST ME
AS A PHYSICIAN.
A LOT OF IT CAN BE VERY
CLINICAL, DIFFERENT PERSON EVERY
TIME.
SUDDENLY YOUR BABY IS THERE,
THERE ARE FOUR NEEDLES GOING
INTO THEM AND YOU DON'T KNOW
WHAT IT IS AND YOU CAN
UNDERSTAND --
>> THAT'S OUR JOBS AS PHYSICIANS
TO EDUCATE OUR PATIENTS.
HISTORICALLY THE U.S. HAS ALWAYS
FAVORED OVER PUBLIC HEALTH AS
BACK IN 1905, A CASE OF JACOBSON
VERSUS MASSACHUSETTS WHERE THE
PREVAILS.
>> STATISTICALLY IF YOU LOOK AT
THE STATES AND YOU LOOK AT THE
PERCENTAGES, THE LOWEST STATES,
90% ARE VACCINATED, SO THAT
MEANS ONLY 10% ARE NOT
VACCINATED OF OUR CHILDREN.
SO 90% ARE PROTECTED.
10% ARE AT RISK.
>> AND WE NEED TO ENFORCE THAT
MORE SO THAT THE NUMBER DOESN'T
DROP BECAUSE LIKE THE DOCTOR
SAYS, THERE'S ALL THESE, YOU
KNOW, OUTBREAKS OF DISEASES SUCH
AS MEASLES AND WE DON'T WANT
INNOCENT CHILDREN TO BE
AFFECTED.
PETE: OUR HEALTHCARE, EDUCATION
SYSTEM, THIS IS SOMETHING THAT
