00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:22,709
Höller is one of very few 
artists who have introduced

2
00:00:22,709 --> 00:00:30,060
the idea of play as an active element
of a work of art.

3
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:48,000
The "Revolving Doors" sculpture
have large handlebars,

4
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,070
which is really an invitation
to the public to engage with it.

5
00:00:59,150 --> 00:01:05,790
Seven huge models of flying agaric 
mushrooms, which is a sort of mushroom

6
00:01:05,790 --> 00:01:11,570
that you eat it, you have a trip, 
a kind of hallucinogenic trip.

7
00:01:11,570 --> 00:01:17,720
These mushrooms as you push this machine, 
the mushrooms literally start to fly.

8
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:20,060
And live up to their botanical name.

9
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:30,590
Carsten Höller is a unique artist
because he came

10
00:01:30,590 --> 00:00:00,000
from a completely different field,
which was the field of biological science.
