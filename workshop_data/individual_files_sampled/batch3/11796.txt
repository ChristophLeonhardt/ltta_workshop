the online technology blockchain is not only making waves in the banking world it could also be the foundation of our future cities just to surmise blockchain is where sensitive data such as financial transactions are held on a network of computers rather than in one central place and that potentially makes such info more secure and easier to verify well for our teens online series crypto Liam Miguel Francis Santiago has been meeting some of its biggest proponents in Silicon Valley and finding out how it could see a whole new type of city be built in the Caribbean the D 10 e world's leading conference on decentralization brought all the stars of blockchain together once again this time in Silicon Valley we caught up with our friend from Singapore founder of ever coin me komak Zamora view from Silicon Valley is absolutely amazing I mean I'm talking to general partners of venture capital firms they're renegotiating their LP agreements they want to hold crypto they want to have custody they're starting to buy tr√©sor wallets it's unbelievable what's happening here you know I think as well we're starting to see the movement of institutional gray capital it's a very very large institutional capital sorry you take an interest in crypto and I think that's really a positive trip we also got to take on crypto from Bob McDermott the original manufacturer of the mousepad who apparently have been in crypto and mining for five years now but most people think that bitcoin is like the core and is the essence of the blockchain in reality the block changed the magic and that will affect I think in the next 10 or 15 years virtually every major industry from pharmaceuticals to law enforcement record-keeping accounting everything will be tied into that the Bitcoin is really more a symptom or a child of the block chamber the block chains the mother I think if the banks allow us to survive and are not too threatened by the competition I think we're going to do very well imagine a city that's fully operated by blockchain technology what could a place like that show the world currently Brock and crystal rose beers of detainee and blockchain unbound are under negotiation with the Puerto Rican mayor for the purchase of several thousand hectares of land for the creation of such a place the idea is to expose the power of blockchain on a global scale by taking a place that's been devastated by a natural disaster and held that we build with crypto and blockchain infrastructure the first step is rebuild what is thereby using better technology more sustainable energy renewable resources and just really bring bring life to the place that exists I think phase 2 is find our ability to build something new and bring all of the the ethos that we have that are surrounding watching see the local government see the local population and really yes build a new type of city stay tuned for portal crypto a unique blockchain city built together with the Puerto Rican government which will showcase to the world the full scale of what crypto can do to post devastated State I'm Miguel Frances Santiago
