1
00:00:00,499 --> 00:00:03,030
“Hello, and welcome to
‘Internetting After Dark.’

2
00:00:03,030 --> 00:00:04,700
If you don’t know
already, I’m Amanda.”

3
00:00:04,700 --> 00:00:05,300
“I’m Shane.”

4
00:00:05,300 --> 00:00:07,800
“And we are here to give you a
closer look inside the making

5
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:09,810
of ‘Internetting
With Amanda Hess.’”

6
00:00:09,810 --> 00:00:11,200
“Should we get started?”

7
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:11,850
“Let’s do it.”

8
00:00:11,850 --> 00:00:14,070
“Let’s do it.”

9
00:00:14,070 --> 00:00:15,732
“So, we just launched
the second season

10
00:00:15,732 --> 00:00:17,940
of ‘Internetting,’ and we
had a big party in New York

11
00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:18,795
to celebrate.”

12
00:00:18,795 --> 00:00:21,639
“We also set up two
anonymous question boxes

13
00:00:21,639 --> 00:00:23,430
so that people who were
attending the event

14
00:00:23,430 --> 00:00:26,040
could ask Amanda
questions. So ...

15
00:00:26,040 --> 00:00:28,440
‘When raccoon
revolution start date?

16
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:30,735
As specific as
possible, please.'"

17
00:00:30,735 --> 00:00:33,630
“So, we made a video that’s
about cats versus dogs

18
00:00:33,630 --> 00:00:35,880
on the internet,
and them fighting

19
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:37,787
for dominance over our feeds.

20
00:00:37,787 --> 00:00:39,120
And a lot of the
comments we got

21
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:41,790
were like asking what all
of these other animals

22
00:00:41,790 --> 00:00:43,730
represent in that ecosystem.

23
00:00:43,730 --> 00:00:45,110
And we heard a lot —

24
00:00:45,110 --> 00:00:46,740
a lot — about
raccoons, which I think

25
00:00:46,740 --> 00:00:49,890
makes sense because they
are right on the border

26
00:00:49,890 --> 00:00:52,920
between like wild animal and
domesticated animal,

27
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:55,470
because they hang outside
of our houses all the time,

28
00:00:55,470 --> 00:00:58,500
and they like eat our
discarded foods.

29
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:01,260
And so the idea
of like bringing them

30
00:01:01,260 --> 00:01:04,680
just a step closer like
inside our houses, I think,

31
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:06,744
is really fascinating.”

32
00:01:06,744 --> 00:01:08,160
“I feel like the
metaphor, though,

33
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:11,760
of feasting on garbage is
very apropos for how we all

34
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:13,350
exist on the
internet right now.

35
00:01:13,350 --> 00:01:16,910
So the idea of someone who’s
gleefully consuming trash

36
00:01:16,910 --> 00:01:18,900
is like a really good
survival mechanism.”

37
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:20,880
“Like maybe we can all
be like the raccoons.”

38
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:22,430
“As you can imagine,
cats versus dogs

39
00:01:22,430 --> 00:01:24,000
is always a hot-button issue.

40
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,670
Jonathan Evans on YouTube
wrote, ‘Cats will always

41
00:01:26,670 --> 00:01:28,620
eat the face of
their owners first

42
00:01:28,620 --> 00:01:30,210
after food sources deplete.

43
00:01:30,210 --> 00:01:32,730
The face!' I have
a cat named Wanda.

44
00:01:32,730 --> 00:01:35,139
Wanda is also pictured
directly behind us.

45
00:01:35,139 --> 00:01:36,930
I’m well aware that
Wanda would eat my face

46
00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:38,990
if I stop feeding her.

47
00:01:38,990 --> 00:01:41,620
And I think that
that’s her prerogative.

48
00:01:41,620 --> 00:01:44,880
And frankly, after
all she’s given me,

49
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:46,260
she has every right to.”

50
00:01:46,260 --> 00:01:48,176
“I don’t think we can
air this without getting

51
00:01:48,176 --> 00:01:49,353
a comment from Wanda.”

52
00:01:49,353 --> 00:01:51,090
“Ooh.”

53
00:01:51,090 --> 00:01:51,750
“Hello, Wanda.”

54
00:01:51,750 --> 00:01:52,710
“Hi, Wanda.

55
00:01:52,710 --> 00:01:54,840
O.K., I have a question.

56
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:59,064
If you were really hungry,
would you eat Shane’s face?”

57
00:02:01,900 --> 00:02:04,490
“I feel like as long as I
keep feeding her, she won’t.”

58
00:02:04,490 --> 00:02:07,310
“We also released
two other videos.

59
00:02:07,310 --> 00:02:10,114
One is about hands, and the
other is about fembots.”

60
00:02:10,755 --> 00:02:12,360
“Bring in the fembots!”

61
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:14,470
“This one garnered
probably the most response

62
00:02:14,470 --> 00:02:16,060
that we had online.

63
00:02:16,060 --> 00:02:19,570
This is from Monty
Cantsin on YouTube.

64
00:02:19,570 --> 00:02:22,660
‘The male-robot-as-evil-threat
narrative is just as prolific

65
00:02:22,660 --> 00:02:25,720
as the fembot, and to sculpt
your narrative to avoid that

66
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:27,130
is disingenuous.

67
00:02:27,130 --> 00:02:29,800
Here’s some evil male-bots
since I can back up

68
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:31,735
my critique off the
top of my head.’”

69
00:02:31,735 --> 00:02:33,232
“That’s actually
a great point.

70
00:02:33,232 --> 00:02:34,690
And I think it’s
really interesting

71
00:02:34,690 --> 00:02:38,650
to actually contrast how we
construct feminine robots

72
00:02:38,650 --> 00:02:41,290
and how we construct
masculine robots.

73
00:02:41,290 --> 00:02:45,730
So if we’re making like techno-women
to be hyper-feminine,

74
00:02:45,730 --> 00:02:49,810
we also seem to be making like
techno-men to be hyper-masculine

75
00:02:49,810 --> 00:02:54,670
and specifically
to be killing machines, which

76
00:02:54,670 --> 00:02:56,230
I think probably
also says something

77
00:02:56,230 --> 00:03:00,010
interesting about how we do
that sometimes to real men,

78
00:03:00,010 --> 00:03:02,410
like particularly during war.

79
00:03:02,410 --> 00:03:04,780
But if you’re
interested in more

80
00:03:04,780 --> 00:03:08,240
about how the internet
is affecting masculinity,

81
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:12,265
we actually have a video about
that coming out real soon.”

82
00:03:12,265 --> 00:03:14,134
“This is from Rob from Kansas.

83
00:03:14,134 --> 00:03:15,550
‘I was surprised
you did not cover

‘Westworld’s’ strong
female robot AI characters.

85
00:03:18,850 --> 00:03:20,436
I particularly
enjoyed the series

86
00:03:20,436 --> 00:03:22,060
because it confronted
the harsh reality

87
00:03:22,060 --> 00:03:24,280
of the kinds of purposes
the male gaze will have

88
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:26,710
for robots in the
future, sexual objects

89
00:03:26,710 --> 00:03:28,630
and violent aggression toys.

90
00:03:28,630 --> 00:03:30,520
The female robot
characters surprise us

91
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:33,310
in their nongender
robot normative agency.’”

92
00:03:33,310 --> 00:03:36,250
“There was one version
of the video where we did

93
00:03:36,250 --> 00:03:40,090
end with this montage
of female robots

94
00:03:40,090 --> 00:03:43,930
rising up and like destroying
their male creators.”

95
00:03:43,930 --> 00:03:48,290
“In pop culture, fembots
have a narrative.

96
00:03:48,290 --> 00:03:50,290
They’re either destroyed
to protect society

97
00:03:50,290 --> 00:03:52,810
from their sexual
danger, or they destroy

98
00:03:52,810 --> 00:03:55,840
to protect themselves.

99
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:59,200
Hey, Siri, what will we do?”

100
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:00,696

Amanda, best thing

101
00:04:00,696 --> 00:04:02,320
you’ve seen on the
internet this week?"

102
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:04,320
“‘Terrace House’ is
currently airing on Netflix,

103
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:06,140
Japanese reality show.

104

It’s like crack.”

105

“For me, I would
say ‘Defunctland.’

106
00:04:09,014 --> 00:04:10,930
Specifically their episode
about the limousine

107
00:04:10,930 --> 00:04:12,475
ride is incredible.”

108
00:04:12,475 --> 00:04:14,050
“Next week we will
have a new episode

109
00:04:14,050 --> 00:04:15,410
of ‘Internetting’ for you.

110
00:04:15,410 --> 00:04:17,798
This one is about
mysticism on the internet.”

111
00:04:17,798 --> 00:04:20,200
“And if you have any questions
or comments or want to say

anything else about
