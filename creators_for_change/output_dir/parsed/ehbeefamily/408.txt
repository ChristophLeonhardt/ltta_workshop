hard work is its own reward
there is no substitute for hard work
carpe diem seize the day a dream does
not become reality through magic it
takes sweat determination and hard work
fall down seven times get back up eight
times Martin Luther King jr. once said
if you can't fly then run if you can't
run then walk if you can't walk then
crawl but whatever you do you have to
keep moving forward do you two have any
questions about working hard and never
being lazy I'm glad we had this talk
yeah y'all this is good
