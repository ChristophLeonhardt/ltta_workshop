John Cleese is back in the news again and this time they're calling him a homophobe I did a show recently about John Cleese about how he's leaving the country and he's trying to get away from the lying press and you know what I don't blame him they've been calling him racist for years John Cleese racist but now of course he's also a homophobe so Kelis was asked during a radio 4 interview the other day about Monty Python not being diverse and he responded by explaining that his former Python colleague terry gilliam now identifies as a black lesbian to get away from all the accusations of white privilege and so forth which I just think is brilliant sue the fact that he spoke directly to the press and said yes I identify as a black lesbian is brilliant no no modern comic would do something like that but then he went on to talk about his late friend and colleague Graham Chapman who was a gay man a gay rights activist and a member of Monty Python and Cleese being a close friend of Chapman when he was alive joked about him being a poof and dead poof now there's an insult I've not heard in a few years so he was saying Chapman being poo a poof and dead may make the team reasonably diverse now he's poking fun at is dead may it's just a stupid joke that you do with your mates even when they're dead and it's a joke that Chapman would have laughed out let's not forget he was in Monty Python for God's sake but the faux outrage to this the faux outrage of the fact that Cleese said the word poof on Radio 4 is so tedious I mean look at some of these tweets this one he really is quite embarrassing Lee gastrin about this one here bad case of homophobia look at these look at this I mean give it a rest give our it's so tedious and boring the virtues signaling that's coming not just from the the leftist er on the street but celebrities you know we said proof on great old dreadful homophobe I mean for God's sake the man is a comedy genius he's one of the greatest of the greats a living comedy legend that I'm really proud of I'm proud that Britain created or such a comedy genius the fact that we can say that he's one of our own but instead we've just steamed ahead written steamed ahead and left geniuses like him behind the left and now the Pearl clutching church ladies and Cleese is essentially a punk at this point think about it that way the left are clutching their pearls while John Cleese is on the radio saying what outdated insults from what 10 20 years ago and even that's offensive poof who says poof anymore John Cleese is doing a damn good job a real good job of proving his point about the cumulus politically correct brigade and I know he's doing it on purpose and I'm glad he's doing it on purpose because before he leaves for the Caribbean where he's going to have a new life of sunshine and relaxation he's exposing the lunacy the real genuine lunacy and insanity of the far left as he leaves and I think him doing that is just as important as the great work he's given us through comedy if you want to see more from me and the rest of the rebel team remember to Like and subscribe you
