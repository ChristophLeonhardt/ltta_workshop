00:00:10,349 --> 00:00:13,110
we<font color="#CCCCCC"> have a special secret collaboration</font>

5
00:00:13,110 --> 00:00:14,460
video that we've been<font color="#CCCCCC"> working with</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> them</font>

6
00:00:14,460 --> 00:00:16,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">on on the last week now if you've been</font>

7
00:00:16,590 --> 00:00:18,330
following them on their social<font color="#CCCCCC"> media on</font>

8
00:00:18,330 --> 00:00:20,039
there<font color="#E5E5E5"> I believe on their Facebook and</font>

9
00:00:20,039 --> 00:00:21,660
their Twitter and been watching their

10
00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:22,980
vlogs you'll know that we've been

11
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:26,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">working on the super secret hush hush</font>

12
00:00:26,330 --> 00:00:30,210
super like our kids<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't even know that</font>

13
00:00:30,210 --> 00:00:32,790
we did this<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's how secret it is so</font>

14
00:00:32,790 --> 00:00:34,110
we've been making this video and

15
00:00:34,110 --> 00:00:35,520
essentially what<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're doing we have</font>

16
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:38,640
challenged we have challenged Nick and

17
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:41,250
<font color="#CCCCCC">Vicky to a number of minute to win it</font>

18
00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:44,730
games now these games we picked two

19
00:00:44,730 --> 00:00:46,950
games they picked two games so there was

20
00:00:46,950 --> 00:00:50,039
no real advantage you know no you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font>

21
00:00:50,039 --> 00:00:51,930
there weren't ringers in certain games

22
00:00:51,930 --> 00:00:54,899
so we did four games now<font color="#CCCCCC"> the way the</font>

23
00:00:54,899 --> 00:00:56,489
scoring works is that if<font color="#CCCCCC"> we each</font>

24
00:00:56,489 --> 00:00:57,899
complete a challenge we each get a point

25
00:00:57,899 --> 00:01:00,719
so if we<font color="#E5E5E5"> do one game we have a potential</font>

26
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:02,309
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> two points back you get a point I get</font>

27
00:01:02,309 --> 00:01:04,319
a point so we are going to see how we do

28
00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:08,250
we did four games and here they all

29
00:01:08,250 --> 00:01:10,040
right so this is our first challenge

30
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:13,409
that we're going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be doing it is</font>

31
00:01:13,409 --> 00:01:15,479
called paper dragon the goal of the game

32
00:01:15,479 --> 00:01:18,060
is we have two streamers one for each

33
00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:20,759
<font color="#E5E5E5">hand and like he's got one</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for each and</font>

34
00:01:20,759 --> 00:01:21,960
we're going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> put them on the ground</font>

35
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:23,790
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> the goal is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> within a minute we</font>

36
00:01:23,790 --> 00:01:25,530
are going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to wrap them around our arms</font>

37
00:01:25,530 --> 00:01:26,970
<font color="#CCCCCC">who can only use our hands and our arms</font>

38
00:01:26,970 --> 00:01:28,500
we're gonna wrap around as fast you can

39
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:29,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">where I see if we can do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it within a</font>

40
00:01:29,790 --> 00:01:32,130
minute if we<font color="#CCCCCC"> do it with a minute I get a</font>

41
00:01:32,130 --> 00:01:34,259
point she gets a point well obviously<font color="#E5E5E5"> if</font>

42
00:01:34,259 --> 00:01:36,960
she does it I don't like she's got two

43
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:40,549
one go

44
00:01:50,659 --> 00:01:53,530

called bobblehead the goal of the game

49
00:02:38,170 --> 00:02:40,780
is to put a pedometer on your head and

50
00:02:40,780 --> 00:02:45,040
you need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get 125 steps steps in one</font>

51
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:48,790
minute so by shaking your head now we

52
00:02:48,790 --> 00:02:50,440
don't have pedometers so we have to put

53
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:53,050
