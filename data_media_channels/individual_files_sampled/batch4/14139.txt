I love when I have the opportunity to recommend a film and it doesn't happen often because well Hollywood you know but this one is an exception I will tell you all about it coming up today on the Hollywood conservative for the rebel hi everybody hope you had a great weekend and I have a movie to recommend to all of you a lot of us leading up to the 2016 election heard about Mark Taylor he's a retired firefighter who prophesied that Donald Trump would win the election his videos were shared all over social media and his story went viral I remember hearing about it but I didn't really remember a lot of the details of it or the circumstances surrounding it I checked out this movie earlier this month full disclosure they sent me a screener so that I could take a look it is very well-made and provides a lot of background to what led to Mark Taylor's vision for our country and the details of his journal writings and ultimately his prophecy that Donald Trump would become president no I don't want to give you any spoilers so I will just fill you in on some of the information on the website if you want to go on the web site for the film you can find theaters in your area where the film will be showing a lot of films of this nature have limited release and often times they don't even appear in the theaters here in Liberal Los Angeles but even here in LA we have numerous theaters showing the film so I'm really excited about that the website for the film is the Trump prophecy movie calm so go check it out and see if it's showing near you regarding the content of the film the website says this Mark Taylor a recently retired fireman had this experience around 2:00 a.m. on the night of April 28 2011 unable to sleep he was channel surfing when he clicked on c-span the man on the screen was Donald Trump and Mark had the premonition that he heard God say you were hearing the voice of the next president little did Mark know several dozen video recordings of other documented of others documented that they also got the same messages and were equally couldn't convinced that it came from God the Trump prophecy is an inspirational message of hope highlighting the vast beauty and greatness of the United States its electoral process and concludes by asking a panel of world leaders to respond to a few questions like what does it mean to make America great again how does a healthy American economy affect world economies what does the Korean US administration mean to the Middle East and specifically Israel how does a strong US military affect the world climate for peace so in light of the midterms coming up in five weeks and 2020 we'll be here before we know it it's a good film to see we need to return to Christian values in this country and if Democrats regain control of either the house or the Senate they will block nearly every single thing the president Trump tries to do from November going forward do not let that happen look at what's happening with Brett Kavanaugh that will be our constant reality if Democrats take back their power which as we have seen they are willing to do anything even immoral unethical and disgusting things to get that power back president Trump winning in 2016 was a major win of course but without control of the upper and lower legislative houses he might as well not have even won so go check out the film again their website is the Trump prophecy movie calm thanks for watching everybody I'm Amanda head the Hollywood conservative for the ruffle if you enjoyed my commentary and want to hear more from all of us here at the rebel subscribe to our premium content at www.affordablecomm.com
