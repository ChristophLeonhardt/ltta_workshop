THE PHILIPPINES, UNDER DUTERTE, IS OF COURSE DEALING WITH SOME VIDEO BUFFERING ñ AND WHETHER OR NOT PEOPLE SING IT WITH ENOUGH ENTHUSIASM. IN FACT, THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES IN THE PHILIPPINES HAS JUST APPROVED LEGISLATION THAT WOULD GIVE PEOPLE A FINE, OR PRISON TIME IF THEY ARE NOT SINGING THE NATIONAL ANTHEM ENTHUSIASTICALLY ENOUGH. IF THE BILL, WHICH WILL BE CONSIDERED BY THE SENATE, IS APPROVED AND PUT INTO LAW, INDIVIDUALS WHO FAILED TO SING THE ANTHEM WITH SUFFICIENT ENERGY WOULD BE PUNISHABLE BY UP TO A YEAR IN PRISON, AND A FINE OF 2000 TO 100,000 PESOS. A SECOND OFFENSE WOULD INCLUDE BOTH A FINE AND PERSON TIME. VIDEO BUFFERING ñ THE NATIONAL ANTHEM IN THE PHILIPPINES IS ACTUALLY REALLY DIFFICULT TO SING, IT IS HIGH-PITCHED. I AM ON SOME PEOPLE SINGING, UNLESS I'M ON THE SHOW, THEN I SING ALL THE TIME, BUT YEAH, WHAT IF YOU JUST CAN'T SING? AND WHO IS THE ARBITER OF WHETHER OR NOT YOU ARE ENTHUSIASTIC ENOUGH? IT GETS WORSE. IT MANDATES ñ THE BILL DOES ñ THAT THE TEMPO OF ANY PUBLIC PERFORMANCE OF THE ANTHEM MUST FALL BETWEEN 100, AND 120 BPM. I WOULD IMMEDIATELY BE ARRESTED. I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT BEATS PER MINUTE IS. I DON'T KNOW ANY ñ THERE'S ñ I COULDN'T BEGIN TO TELL YOU IF SOMETHING IS WITHIN 100, AND 120 BPM IS LITERALLY MY LIFE DEPENDED ON IT, AND IN THE PHILIPPINES IT MIGHT. I JUST DEFINED IT FOR YOU. IT'S UNTZ UNTZ UNTZ UNTZ. HOW MANY UNTZ'S IN A MINUTE, THAT'S LITERALLY WHAT IT IS. THAT'S WHAT IT SOUNDS LIKE. YOU ARE SPEAKING CHINESE TO ME. NOW, YOU MIGHT BE TENDED TO MAKE FUN OF THE PHILIPPINES, AND YOU WOULD BE RIGHT ñ AND, BY THE WAY, NOT THE PEOPLE, BUT OBVIOUSLY THE GOVERNMENT ñ BUT THEY ARE NOT ALONE, IN INDIA YOU MUST ALSO STAND FOR THE NATIONAL ANTHEM, AND THEY PLAY BEFORE MOVIES, WHICH IS NICE AND ANNOYING. AND THEY ARE NOT PLAYING, TWO DIFFERENT INCIDENTS, THEY ARRESTED 19 DIFFERENT PEOPLE FOR NOT STANDING FOR THE INDIAN NATIONAL ANTHEM IN MOVIE THEATERS. SO THEY WENT TO PRISON. IN THAILAND, THE NATIONAL ANTHEM IS PLAYED ALL ACROSS THE COUNTRY, IN GOVERNMENT BUILDINGS, PARKS AND TRAIN STATIONS, AT 8 AM AND 6 PM. PEOPLE ARE EXPECTED TO STAND AND BE SILENT. SO YOU ARE LIKE, RUSHING TO WORK, YOU HAVE TO STAND AND BE SILENT. BUT THEN THEY CONSIDERED HAVING CARS ALSO STOP. AND THEN THEY WERE LIKE, THAT'S A REALLY BAD IDEA. THAT'S A REALLY BAD IDEA. THAT WOULD BE MISERABLE. COULD YOU IMAGINE? 8 AM, SLAMS ON THE BRAKES, ON THE FREEWAYS. I MEAN, WHO IS THE CLOWN WHO CAME UP WITH THAT IDEA? AND THEN THERE IS ñ YOU CANNOT OFFEND THE DIGNITY OF THE MONARCH IN THAILAND, IT'S LIKE THE STORY WE TALKED ABOUT BEFORE. IN THIS CASE, NOT STANDING AT AN ANTHEM BEING PLAYED IN A MOVIE THEATER, IN 2007 SOMEONE WAS ARRESTED FOR THAT, THEY FACED UP TO 15 YEARS IN PRISON. FOR OFFENDING THE DIGNITY OF THE MAJESTY THERE. THE CHINESE ALSO HAVE A LAW ON THIS. DEROGATORY PROMISES OF THE ANTHEM, BUT THEY ARE FAR MORE MERCIFUL, YOU ONLY GET 15 DAYS IN DETENTION. AND NOW, WE ARE ALL LAUGHING, THE CHINESE, THE INDIANS, THE PHILIPPINES, HERE IN AMERICA WE REALIZE THE NATIONAL ANTHEM, YOU SHOULDN'T PUNISH PEOPLE FOR THAT. UNLESS OF COURSE THEY PLAY IN THE NFL. THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT I WAS GOING TO BRING UP. WE MIGHT NOT HAVE A PERMIT THAT PUNISHES US FOR NOT STANDING UP DURING THE NATIONAL ANTHEM, YET, BUT WE DO HAVE A COURT OF PUBLIC OPINION, AND THAT COURT OF PUBLIC OPINION HAS BEEN BRUTAL AGAINST PEOPLE WHO HAVE USED THE NATIONAL ANTHEM IN SOME FORM OF PROTEST. SO, COLIN KAEPERNICK, IT HAS BEEN MUCH DESTROYED HIS CAREER. IT IS NOT JUST THE COURT OF PUBLIC OPINION, WHICH IS ALWAYS MIXED. THERE'S A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO LOVE COLIN KAEPERNICK, IT'S A MIXED BAG. NO, THE PEOPLE WHO REALLY CAN'T STAND COLIN KAEPERNICK ARE THE PEOPLE WHO ARE IN POWER, THE ACTUAL NFL OWNERS. THEY ARE CLAIMING THAT YOU CAN GO THREE QUARTERBACKS DEEP, ON EACH TEAM, 32 TEAMS, AND COLIN KAEPERNICK STILL WOULDN'T MAKE ANY OF THOSE TEAMS. THAT IS A PREPOSTEROUS CLAIM. SO, IN AMERICA, IF YOU DON'T STAND FOR THE NATIONAL ANTHEM, YOU COULD LOSE MILLIONS OF DOLLARS. YOU ARE TALKING OF A COUPLE THOUSAND DOLLARS FINE IN THE PHILIPPINES, AND WE MAKE FUN OF THEM? OF COURSE KAEPERNICK WAS IN A UNIQUE SITUATION WHERE HE WAS MAKING MILLIONS, SO WE CAN LOSE MILLIONS, BUT THAT IS WHAT HAPPENED. NOW, THIS JUST HAPPENED TO BE IN THE NEWS, WE DIDN'T DO IT BECAUSE OF KAEPERNICK, IT WAS JUST A LAW THAT WAS PROPOSED IN THE PHILIPPINES RECENTLY, BUT WE SHOULD LOOK INTERNALLY AS WELL. I HAVE SAID IT A MILLION TIMES ON THIS SHOW; I LOVE AMERICA, I BELIEVE WE SHOULD NOT RUN FROM THE IDEA OF AMERICA, THE FLAG OF AMERICA, WE LOVE IT, AND WE FEEL LIKE WE SHOULD LIVE UP TO THAT IDEA. BUT THE BEAUTY IS THAT EVERYONE HAS THEIR OWN OPINION, AND YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE TO SING THE NATIONAL ALBUM, OR STAND FOR THE NATIONAL ANTHEM WITH THE SAME FERVOR THAT YOU DO, SO DON'T BE A WEIRDO DICTATOR WANT TO BE, OR A MONARCH WANT TO BE, WE ARE SUPPOSED TO BE A FREE COUNTRY. SO, AS MUCH AS I WOULD SAY TO THE KING OF THAILAND, AS THE CLOWN IN THE PHILIPPINES, DUTERTE, I WOULD SAY EQUALLY TO THE NFL OWNERS, YOU SHOULD ACTUALLY BELIEVE ENOUGH IN YOUR COUNTRY THAT YOU HAVE TO MANDATE PATRIOTISM.
