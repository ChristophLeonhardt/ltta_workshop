11
00:00:24,224 --> 00:00:24,557
PROCESS.

12
00:00:24,558 --> 00:00:25,224
CHUCK GRASSLEY.

13
00:00:25,225 --> 00:00:28,661
SENATOR, FIRST OFF, TODAY WE

14
00:00:28,662 --> 00:00:29,696

16
00:00:30,931 --> 00:00:31,898
DUPE ALREADY HOW IT'S GOING

17
00:00:31,899 --> 00:00:37,036
TO GO?

18
00:00:37,037 --> 00:00:38,071
OUR LEADER SAID YESTERDAY

19
00:00:38,072 --> 00:00:39,205
THIS IS ONE OF THE FEW TIMES

20
00:00:39,206 --> 00:00:40,506
IN THE UNITED STATES SENATE

21
00:00:40,507 --> 00:00:42,709
WE WON'T KNOW HOW IT'S GOING

22
00:00:42,710 --> 00:00:44,177
TO GO UNTIL EVERYBODY HAS

23
00:00:44,178 --> 00:00:47,013
CAST THEIR VOTE.

24
00:00:47,014 --> 00:00:51,484
SO WE DON'T AS OF NOW I

25
00:00:51,485 --> 00:00:53,086
DON'T KNOW AND I DON'T THINK

26
00:00:53,087 --> 00:00:54,921
ANYBODY ELSE DOES.

27
00:00:54,922 --> 00:00:55,788
BRIAN: THE CLOTURE VOTE WILL

28
00:00:55,789 --> 00:00:56,723
THAT LIKELY PASS BECAUSE

29
00:00:56,724 --> 00:00:57,590
THAT'S NOT THE FINAL VOTE

30
00:00:57,591 --> 00:00:58,992
AND THE ONE UP FOR GRABS IS

31
00:00:58,993 --> 00:00:59,692
THE BIG ONE?

32
00:00:59,693 --> 00:01:02,028
>> I THINK YOU ARE GOING TO

33
00:01:02,029 --> 00:01:03,096
FIND BOTH VOTES ABOUT THE

34
00:01:03,097 --> 00:01:05,298
SAME FOR EVERYBODY.

35
00:01:05,299 --> 00:01:06,265
AINSLEY: SENATOR, HOW DO WE

36
00:01:06,266 --> 00:01:07,934
NOT KNOW HOW JEFF FLAKE AND

37
00:01:07,935 --> 00:01:10,970
SUSAN COLLINS, MURKOWSKI AND

38
00:01:10,971 --> 00:01:12,205
MANCHIN ARE GOING TO VOTE?

39
00:01:12,206 --> 00:01:12,905
I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY THEY

40
00:01:12,906 --> 00:01:13,706
ARE NOT SAYING?

41
00:01:13,707 --> 00:01:15,208
ARE THEY WAITING UNTIL THE

42
00:01:15,209 --> 00:01:16,342
VERY END BECAUSE THEY DON'T

43
00:01:16,343 --> 00:01:18,077
WANT TO BE SWAYED BY THEIR

44
00:01:18,078 --> 00:01:18,411
VOTERS?

45
00:01:18,412 --> 00:01:19,045
WHAT MORE INFORMATION DO

46
00:01:19,046 --> 00:01:19,912
THEY NEED?

47
00:01:19,913 --> 00:01:21,047
WE ALREADY HAVE THE FBI

48
00:01:21,048 --> 00:01:21,381
REPORT.

49
00:01:21,382 --> 00:01:22,682
WHY DON'T WE KNOW HOW THEY

50
00:01:22,683 --> 00:01:23,216
ARE GOING TO VOTE?

51
00:01:23,217 --> 00:01:25,084
>> BECAUSE THEY ARE VERY

52
00:01:25,085 --> 00:01:26,052
PERSONAL, VERY QUIET ABOUT

53
00:01:26,053 --> 00:01:31,024
IT AND I THINK THAT THEY

54
00:01:31,025 --> 00:01:32,091
WANT -- LEGITIMATELY I FOUND

55
00:01:32,092 --> 00:01:33,092
MYSELF IN THE SAME POSITION.

56
00:01:33,093 --> 00:01:34,794
YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE BEFORE

57
00:01:34,795 --> 00:01:36,329
YOU MAKE A FINAL DECISION,

58
00:01:36,330 --> 00:01:38,164
YOU WANT YOUR CONSTITUENTS

59
00:01:38,165 --> 00:01:39,999
TO KNOW THAT YOU ARE VERY

60
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,769
THOUGHTFUL ABOUT IT AND WHAT

61
00:01:42,770 --> 00:01:43,670
MIGHT COME UP NEW.

62
00:01:43,671 --> 00:01:44,704
THEY ARE GOING TO WAIT IN

63
00:01:44,705 --> 00:01:45,638
THE LAST MINUTE.

64
00:01:45,639 --> 00:01:46,706
I HAVE BEEN IN THAT SAME

65
00:01:46,707 --> 00:01:47,073
POSITION.

66
00:01:47,074 --> 00:01:48,441
SO I'M NOT GOING TO HOLD IT

67
00:01:48,442 --> 00:01:49,776
AGAINST THEM FOR NOT

68
00:01:49,777 --> 00:01:52,311
ANNOUNCING AHEAD OF TIME.

69
00:01:52,312 --> 00:01:53,813
BRIAN: WE WILL SEE WHERE

70
00:01:53,814 --> 00:01:54,280
THAT GOES.

71
00:01:54,281 --> 00:01:55,481
MURKOWSKI WANTS TO GO BACK

72
00:01:55,482 --> 00:01:56,549
AND SEE MORE.

73
00:01:56,550 --> 00:01:57,650
DOESN'T FEEL AS THOUGH SHE

74
00:01:57,651 --> 00:01:59,085
HAD ENOUGH TIME.

75
00:01:59,086 --> 00:02:00,753
SO DOES MANCHIN, I THINK.

76
00:02:00,754 --> 00:02:01,487
WHEN YOU LOOK AT THIS.

77
00:02:01,488 --> 00:02:03,089
THE DEMOCRATS ARE LINED UP

78
00:02:03,090 --> 00:02:04,791
ALMOST IN UNISON OUTSIDE OF

79
00:02:04,792 --> 00:02:06,759
MANCHIN SAYING THIS IS A

80
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:07,060
SHAM.

81
00:02:07,061 --> 00:02:09,295
MENENDEZ USES AN EXPLICATIVE

82
00:02:09,295 --> 00:02:11,029
SAYING IT'S ALL B.S.

83
00:02:11,031 --> 00:02:11,698
DESPITE THE THOUSAND PAGES

84
00:02:11,699 --> 00:02:13,433
AND THE MULTIPLE INTERVIEWS.

85
00:02:13,434 --> 00:02:15,435
ARE YOU SURPRISED THAT THE

86
00:02:15,436 --> 00:02:16,569
PEOPLE THAT DEMANDED ONE

87
00:02:16,570 --> 00:02:18,304
WEEK FOR AN EVALUATION LAST

88
00:02:18,305 --> 00:02:19,572
WEEK ARE SAYING IT'S NOT

89
00:02:19,573 --> 00:02:20,773
ENOUGH THIS WEEK?

90
00:02:20,774 --> 00:02:22,775
>> NOT ONLY THAT BUT DURING

91
00:02:22,776 --> 00:02:25,311
OUR LAST HEARING, THEY SAID

92
00:02:25,312 --> 00:02:26,512
WE OUGHT TO BE HAVING THE

93
00:02:26,513 --> 00:02:28,915
FBI LOOK AT ONE PERSON, ONLY

94
00:02:28,916 --> 00:02:29,615
ONE PERSON.

95
00:02:29,616 --> 00:02:31,250
ENDED UP LOOKING AT ABOUT 12

96
00:02:31,251 --> 00:02:31,584
PEOPLE.

97
00:02:31,585 --> 00:02:33,586
BUT THEY NEED TO LOOK AT

98
00:02:33,587 --> 00:02:35,922
THIS GUY, HIS LAST NAME IS

99
00:02:35,923 --> 00:02:36,322
JUDGE.

100
00:02:36,323 --> 00:02:37,790
THEY WENT WAY BEYOND THAT

101
00:02:37,791 --> 00:02:38,858
THEY AREN'T SATISFIED.

102
00:02:38,859 --> 00:02:40,393
THEY ARE ALWAYS MOVING THE

103
00:02:40,394 --> 00:02:41,060
GOAL POST.

104
00:02:41,061 --> 00:02:42,295
I THINK YOU HAVE GOT TO GO

105
00:02:42,296 --> 00:02:43,730
BACK TO JULY THE 10TH.

106
00:02:43,731 --> 00:02:44,897
WHEN SCHUMER SAID HE IS

107
00:02:44,898 --> 00:02:46,232
GOING TO DO ANYTHING UNDER

108
00:02:46,233 --> 00:02:49,435
THE SUN TO DEFEAT THIS

109
00:02:49,436 --> 00:02:49,836
NOMINATION.

110
00:02:49,837 --> 00:02:50,703
I HAVE BEEN TRYING TO HAVE A

111
00:02:50,704 --> 00:02:52,004
FAIR AND THOROUGH AND OPEN

112
00:02:52,005 --> 00:02:53,973
HEARING AND I THINK WE HAVE

113
00:02:53,974 --> 00:02:57,243
DONE EXACTLY THAT TO GET

114
00:02:57,244 --> 00:03:00,113
EVERYTHING OUT ON THE TAPE.

115
00:03:00,114 --> 00:03:01,147
AND I HAVE BEEN DEALING WITH

116
00:03:01,148 --> 00:03:03,382
A DEMOLITION DERBY ON THE

117
00:03:03,383 --> 00:03:04,851
PART OF THE DEMOCRATS WHERE

118
00:03:04,852 --> 00:03:06,052
THEY HAVE BEEN OUT TO DO

119
00:03:06,053 --> 00:03:07,086
EVERYTHING THEY CAN TO

120
00:03:07,087 --> 00:03:08,187
DEFEAT HIM.

121
00:03:08,188 --> 00:03:09,222
AND ONE OF THE THINGS YOU

122
00:03:09,223 --> 00:03:11,023
WOULD THINK THAT THEY WOULD

123
00:03:11,024 --> 00:03:12,825
BE CONCENTRATING ON IS HE

124
00:03:12,826 --> 00:03:15,561

00:03:16,563 --> 00:03:19,098
12 YEARS ON THE D.C.

132
00:03:19,099 --> 00:03:20,533
CIRCUIT.

133
00:03:20,534 --> 00:03:21,033
307 DECISIONS.

134
00:03:21,034 --> 00:03:22,535
WHAT IS THERE ABOUT THIS

135
00:03:22,536 --> 00:03:23,770
PERSON THAT HE SHOULDN'T BE

136
00:03:23,771 --> 00:03:25,138

EVERYTHING THAT'S BEEN AT

140
00:03:29,676 --> 00:03:33,813
ISSUE IS SECONDARY THINGS.

141
00:03:33,814 --> 00:03:34,480
AINSLEY: SENATOR, WHAT DO

142
00:03:34,481 --> 00:03:35,448
YOU THINK ABOUT PROTESTERS

143
00:03:35,449 --> 00:03:37,517
ATTACKING YOUR COLLEAGUES IN

144
00:03:37,518 --> 00:03:38,584
ELEVATORS.

>> I THINK IT'S A REFLECTION

154
00:03:43,524 --> 00:03:45,191
OF THE INCIVILITY OF

155
00:03:45,192 --> 00:03:47,226
AMERICAN SOCIETY GENERALLY

156
00:03:47,227 --> 00:03:51,831
AND I THINK IT'S ALSO

157
00:03:51,832 --> 00:03:53,266
EVIDENCE THAT PEOPLE WILL GO

158
00:03:53,267 --> 00:03:54,667

159
00:03:54,668 --> 00:03:57,870
ENCOURAGED BY PEOPLE ON

SAYING GET IN THEIR FACE.

166
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:08,614
WE AS SENATORS OUGHT TO BE

167
00:04:08,615 --> 00:04:09,949
SETTING EXAMPLES FOR

168
00:04:09,950 --> 00:04:12,552
CIVILITY, NOT ENCOURAGING

169
00:04:12,553 --> 00:04:12,952
INCIVILITY.

170
00:04:12,953 --> 00:04:16,756
YOU'VE HEARD ABOUT THE

171
00:04:16,757 --> 00:04:18,024
RESISTANCE SINCE

172
00:04:18,024 --> 00:04:18,456
NOVEMBER 2016.

YOU ARE SEEING THE REISIS

174
00:04:23,063 --> 00:04:23,663
RESISTANCE HEADQUARTERS

176
00:04:24,798 --> 00:04:26,165
ALL AMONG DEMOCRATS.

177

PETE: WOULD ANY OF YOUR

178
00:04:27,167 --> 00:04:28,868
DEMOCRATIC COLLEAGUES ADMIT

179
00:04:28,869 --> 00:04:29,168
THAT?

180
00:04:29,169 --> 00:04:31,137
YOU SAY WE HAVE GONE TOO

181
00:04:31,138 --> 00:04:31,404

HALLWAYS.

186
00:04:41,315 --> 00:04:42,515
>> DON'T FORGET, THERE ARE

187
00:04:42,516 --> 00:04:43,316
SOME PEOPLE ON THE RIGHT

188
00:04:43,317 --> 00:04:48,054
THAT GET OVERLY AMBITIOUS

189
00:04:48,055 --> 00:04:50,690
AND VICIOUS AS WELL.

190
00:04:50,691 --> 00:04:51,891
WE HERE ON CAPITOL HILL,

191
00:04:51,892 --> 00:04:53,693
HAVE TO SET AN EXAMPLE FOR

192
00:04:53,694 --> 00:04:55,895
CIVILITY.

193
00:04:55,896 --> 00:04:56,529
BRIAN: RIGHT.

194
00:04:56,530 --> 00:04:57,997
SENATOR, CHAIRMAN,

195
00:04:57,998 --> 00:04:59,532
UNDERSTAND THAT LEE LAND

196
00:04:59,533 --> 00:05:04,604
KAISER, THE FORMER FRIEND OF

197
00:05:04,605 --> 00:05:05,838
DR. FORD FEELS PRESSURE TO

198
00:05:05,839 --> 00:05:08,941
REVISIT OTHER DENIAL OF

199
00:05:08,942 --> 00:05:11,644
KNOWING ABOUT THE ALLEGED

200
00:05:11,645 --> 00:05:13,913
ASSAULT BACK IN 10TH GRADE.

201
00:05:13,914 --> 00:05:14,847
HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT HER

202
00:05:14,848 --> 00:05:16,449
SAYING THAT SHE FEELS

203
00:05:16,450 --> 00:05:17,416
PRESSURED BY DEMOCRATS TO

204
00:05:17,417 --> 00:05:19,252
CHANGE HER STORY?

205
00:05:19,253 --> 00:05:21,754
>> THERE IS EVIDENCE -- I

206
00:05:21,755 --> 00:05:22,889
CAN'T SPEAK ABOUT IT BECAUSE

207
00:05:22,890 --> 00:05:24,090
IT'S IN THE FBI REPORT.

208
00:05:24,091 --> 00:05:26,192
BUT THERE IS EVIDENCE ABOUT

209
00:05:26,193 --> 00:05:27,960
OTHER PEOPLE THAT HAVE BEEN

210
00:05:27,961 --> 00:05:30,997
QUESTIONED THAT THEY WERE

211
00:05:30,998 --> 00:05:31,998
LED INTO IT AS WELL.

212
00:05:31,999 --> 00:05:33,699
THIS IS ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF

213
00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:35,067
HEADQUARTERS FOR THE

214
00:05:35,068 --> 00:05:35,935
RESISTANCE BEING RIGHT HERE

215
00:05:35,936 --> 00:05:37,570
ON CAPITOL HILL.

216
00:05:37,571 --> 00:05:39,105
>> AND DO YOU BELIEVE THAT

217
00:05:39,106 --> 00:05:42,008
THERE IS A PROBLEM WITH

218
00:05:42,009 --> 00:05:44,243
DEBRA -- DR. FORD'S

219
00:05:44,244 --> 00:05:45,111
COLLABORATION WITH THE

220
00:05:45,112 --> 00:05:46,145
DEMOCRATIC PARTY.

221
00:05:46,146 --> 00:05:46,913
WHAT PAPERWORK DO YOU WANT

222
00:05:46,914 --> 00:05:48,247
TO SEE THAT YOU HAVEN'T SEEN

223
00:05:48,248 --> 00:05:48,514
YET?

224
00:05:48,515 --> 00:05:50,249
WHAT DO YOU NEED TO SEE IN

225
00:05:50,250 --> 00:05:51,684
TERMS OF THE COMMUNICATION?

226
00:05:51,685 --> 00:05:52,618
>> POLYGRAPH.

227
00:05:52,619 --> 00:05:54,720
OTHER THINGS THAT SHE TALKED

228
00:05:54,721 --> 00:05:55,421
ABOUT TO "THE WASHINGTON

229
00:05:55,422 --> 00:05:55,721
POST."

230
00:05:55,722 --> 00:05:56,822
IF SHE CAN TALK TO THE "THE

231
00:05:56,823 --> 00:05:57,456
WASHINGTON POST" ABOUT IT,

232
00:05:57,457 --> 00:05:58,858
SHE OUGHT TO TALK TO US.

233
00:05:58,859 --> 00:06:00,293
BUT, LET'S GET BACK TO THE

234
00:06:00,294 --> 00:06:01,560
WILL

235
00:06:01,561 --> 00:06:01,594
LELL

236
00:06:01,595 --> 00:06:02,929
LEGITIMACY OF FORD COMING

237
00:06:02,930 --> 00:06:03,262
FORWARD.

238
00:06:03,263 --> 00:06:05,197
IF SHE WAS -- SHE WAS

239
00:06:05,198 --> 00:06:07,433
ASSAULTED, I BELIEVE SHE WAS

240
00:06:07,434 --> 00:06:07,800
ASSAULTED.

241
00:06:07,801 --> 00:06:11,504
THERE IS NO CORROBORATION

242
00:06:11,505 --> 00:06:15,441
ABOUT HER JUDGMENT THAT IT

243
00:06:15,442 --> 00:06:16,776
WAS JUDGE KAVANAUGH, BUT

244
00:06:16,777 --> 00:06:18,077
HAVE YOU GOT TO TAKE SEXUAL

245
00:06:18,078 --> 00:06:20,012
ASSAULT ACCUSATIONS VERY

246
00:06:20,013 --> 00:06:20,413
SERIOUSLY.

247
00:06:20,414 --> 00:06:23,482
WE DON'T DO THAT ENOUGH IN

248
00:06:23,483 --> 00:06:24,150
AMERICAN SOCIETY.

249
00:06:24,151 --> 00:06:26,052
AND THIS -- WHETHER FORD IS

250
00:06:26,053 --> 00:06:27,186
RIGHT ABOUT JUDGE KAVANAUGH

251
00:06:27,187 --> 00:06:32,625
OR NOT, THE FACT THAT WE HAD

252
00:06:32,626 --> 00:06:34,994
A BRINGING TO PEOPLE'S

253
00:06:34,995 --> 00:06:36,395
ATTENTION THE MAJOR SOCIAL

254
00:06:36,396 --> 00:06:38,564
PROBLEM WE HAVE ABOUT SEXUAL

255
00:06:38,565 --> 00:06:40,499
ASSAULT, THAT IS AT LEAST

256
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:42,168
ONE GOOD ACCOMPLISHED BY

257
00:06:42,169 --> 00:06:45,838
DR. FORD COMING FORWARD EVEN

258
00:06:45,839 --> 00:06:47,473
EVEN THOUGH SHE WANTED

259
00:06:47,474 --> 00:06:49,342
ANONYMITY AND EVEN THOUGH

260
00:06:49,343 --> 00:06:50,176
SENATOR FEINSTEIN OR OTHER

261
00:06:50,177 --> 00:06:51,177
DEMOCRATS ON THE COMMITTEE

262
00:06:51,178 --> 00:06:54,847
DIDN'T PROTECT HER

263
00:06:54,848 --> 00:06:55,381
CONFIDENTIALITY.

264
00:06:55,382 --> 00:00:00,000
AINSLEY: THANK YOU FOR
