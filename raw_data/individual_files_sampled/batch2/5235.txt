big story that sort of rolled through yesterday late into the night Trump's top attorney on Russia doubt out and Trump's national security adviser HR McMaster has been fired he's been replaced we have a new national security adviser to look forward to this morning I believe he starts on April 9th John Bolton and Andrea Mitchell describe him in 10 seconds or less a bomb thrower a knife fighter a bureaucratic in fighter really smart super hawk okay so we have that to look forward to in terms of the international implications as it pertains to our place in the world and our national security but what matters to trump seems to be from my knowledge of him over the past decade or so is money and sex and the lawyer for former porn star stormy Daniel is turning up the heat on President Trump ahead of his clients highly anticipated 60 minutes interview Michael avenatti is now demanding that the Trump Organization preserve all records related to his client he says he plans to subpoena them citing quote unmistakable links between Donald Trump's company and a secrecy agreement that she signed is now and is now suing to get nullified that was followed up by this cryptic tweet a photo of a disc and a caption implying that he has evidence quote if a picture is worth a thousand words how many words is this worth president Trump denies any and all affairs including the allegations from former Playboy Playmate Karen McDougal she claims she had a 10-month affair with Trump also beginning in 2006 McDougal is currently suing the parent company of the National Enquirer for the rights to her story she claims she was mislead when she entered into contract with American media in the months before the 2016 election joining us now the attorney representing Karen McDougal Peter stris and attorney stress what exactly is your client alleging pertaining to the efforts to keep her silent well I think I'll start by saying that Karen finally got to tell her story last night with Anderson Cooper right and I think you know I'll let the American public judge but in my view she was authentic she was credible and were just pleased that she was able to do that and that we could accomplish that with the lawsuit I think there's some confusion as to the the point of the lawsuit right but it's actually quite simple Karen wants to be able to defend herself in her own words in her own voice just like he did last night without American media essentially using this contract to try and manipulate threatened and silencer and that's effectively what they've done for for the better part of a year so if the contract Peter is still in place why was Karen able to go on with Anderson Cooper last night and tell that story that's a great question so the contract was amended basically starting with the election it was formally amended a few weeks later to allow Karen to respond to legitimate media requests but for the past year there's been a pattern of behavior and you know we have plenty of evidence that we're going to show in court that American media has essentially said well you know is this a legitimate media request are you responding you know frightening her with either financial ruin or you know other consequences if she did precisely what you did last night was unacceptable so when you say she was threatened she was threatened by American media Inc yes and when I say threatened I don't mean physically this is not a stormy Daniel situation where we have any situation has said they're gonna hurt her I don't want to suggest that it was threatened in a sense you're in violation with contract and there could be punitive damages yeah they're the exact words are it something that's massive you know a massive financial injury or and she's your client has said that Michael Cohen she believes was involved that's the personal attorney for President Trump in the negotiation with American media Inc that suggested someone representing the president the United States is in the middle of this has he been in touch with your client at any point in the last year along the way no I the situation is actually pretty simple from our perspective she thought she was negotiating with the publishing company right and she thought she was doing a legitimate deal and when they said we're not going to publish the story they said we're not going to publish it because we don't want to damage your reputation you're our partner and then she comes to find out that her attorney was having direct discussions with Michael Cohen I mean it's it's deeply troubling as we as we enter kind of stormy Sunday we we see this pattern and Michael Cohen is at the center of all of it we saw that cryptic photo posted by Michael avenatti the attorney for stormy Daniels of a disc suggesting perhaps there's a photograph does your client have physical evidence of a relationship with President Trump whether it's text messages or photographs or anything else so I don't want to answer that and and I want to tell you why the Karan's truth I think as she made very clear last night is she didn't want to talk about this she doesn't want to make this about her relationship with Donald Trump the only reason she came forward is because she needs to be able to defend herself that's the point of our lawsuit if if people are gonna lie and say that she's a gold digger her story is incredible she has to be able in her own words and and in her own voice to be able to respond and that's what this contract is prohibiting her from doing will she be able to prove in court that she had a real physical relationship with President Trump well the point I think there is clear evidence but that's not the point of the lawsuit the point of the lawsuit is that this contract is the result of fraud is that this contract is illegal and if this contract is voided she doesn't have to prove anything she can go back to living a private life and and respond to suggestions when she sees fit John one more question and then I'll turn it over to although this was a negotiation of contract between your client and American media Inc does she have reason to believe that any pressure was placed on America Media Inc by the President or someone representing the president in other words does she believe this was a two-person deal or that it involved someone representing Donald Trump well so the irony of it is that the information that she getting is the kind of information the American public is getting she's finding this out from reporting by the New York Times The Wall Street Journal etc here's what we know for sure we know that when she went to AMI she was brought there by Keith Davidson a lawyer who now it's it's publicly reported has a close relationship with Michael Cohen right she know we know that ami immediately went and reported this back to trump people now they claim it's because they wanted to check and confirm the story but look let's be honest here they say that they didn't run the story because it's not credible this is a National Enquirer I mean they publish stories about people giving birth to aliens and yet her story was incredible I mean the the public can decide they saw her last night I think the truth is going to come out in court some of those stories about giving birth the aliens are pretty compelling just be honest about that I want to ask you I know that I know that you're saying that the the substance of the relationship is not the point in some ways but it is in fact Minh in the sense that it it goes to the the nature of the relationship and it also goes to what is now a huge political issue that relates to the president's conduct and the kinds of things he's tried to cover up so there was been reporting on this in The New Yorker and elsewhere about the about how their relationship came to be I just want you to talk a little bit about the ways in which she encountered what seems to have been a pretty well worked out system by which the now presidents conducted relationships of this kind she was not alone she didn't perceive herself to Abby to be unique in her relationship just talk a little bit about the way in which it seemed to be there was a whole kind of architecture of trying to keep these these relationships out of the public eye well I think there's a few things in that regard that are that are fairly uncontroversial so one of them is that she was represented by an attorney and Keith Davidson who has clear ties to Michael Cohen and that's that's important because she had no idea that wasn't disclosed by him she thought he was representing her and looking out for her and you know he brought her he brought her to ABC and when she was talking to ABC there was no money in it she wasn't going to be paid she was gonna go on like she did last night with Anderson Cooper and tell her story so she had no reason to believe that there was some sort of three-part collusion between him and and people in the Trump administration she thought that he was advancing her interest but yet he took her to AMI and you know I think we know where that went does she have anything interesting to say about the role in the rush to be she had with or with President Trump she have anything interesting to say about the role of Keith's killer well I mean it depends on what you mean by interesting I think she was pretty honest yesterday that Keith Schiller picked her up and took her to Donald Trump and he didn't do it once he didn't do it twice he did it dozens of times and so you know I don't want to put anyone on trial here but if this becomes kind of a question about who's telling the truth then I think there's these difficult questions to ask about you know who's protecting who and and people can judge you know they saw her last night I think I think it's pretty clear that she's she's authentic and we should remind people Keith Schiller is the longtime bodyguard and personal confidant of President Trump one last question before we let you go he has anyone from the White House has anyone from President Trump's camp reached out to her in recent weeks not only is the answer to that no nobody from American media has reached out and so I think I find it ironic that they issue statements and they say that she was always free to talk and that this is a matter of of contractual negotiation when that's not you know what what they what they say and how they behave are actually quite different and that's why we were forced to bring this lawsuit and at a minimum at least you know we have the light of day the American public was able to to see in her words and and in her voice what her experience were all right Peter stris attorney for Karen McDougal who alleges a 10-month relationship with Donald Trump thanks for being with us we appreciate it thank you for having me cut yeah I mean you look at all of this big picture that president has relationship issues whether it's Vladimir Putin and his inability to have a relationship that's based on honesty and with our national security front-and-center whether it's with the people closest to him inside the White House as president of the United States he can't keep a national security adviser more than a few months he can't keep a relationship going with the people helping him run this country who were supposed to be working for the country he has fired so many people the list is too long he obviously if you believe the allegations that are being put forward here can't handle women he has to have lawyers clean up his messes in doing so might they have threatened to these women stormy Daniels will be appearing on 60 minutes this Sunday claims the president tried to threaten her and there are claims from her attorney that there is evidence of a lot of different things that went wrong in the relationship and it's not about the sex here Karen McDougal the former Playboy Playmate says she's being defamed says she wants the right to the story of her life back she doesn't want to be called a liar she doesn't want to be called a gold digger she wants the rights to her story and yet there seems to be some sort of deal between President Trump or president Trump's lawyer and the head of a media organization that owns the Enquirer which I have a little experience with as it pertains to Trump and I've seen this pattern before it appears there was a deal to silence her and that woman now wants the rights to her story back she wants to speak out he is a problem with relationships
