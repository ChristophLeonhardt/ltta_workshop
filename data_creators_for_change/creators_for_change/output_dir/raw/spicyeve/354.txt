124
00:06:12,030 --> 00:06:13,259
<font color="#CCCCCC">nice trick would be to follow that a</font>

125
00:06:13,259 --> 00:06:15,080
straight and see what it talks about and

126
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:18,780
Asterix says contains only USDA

127
00:06:18,780 --> 00:06:22,139

basic oils<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know avocado oil a hobo</font>

130
00:06:31,949 --> 00:06:34,020
oil a quick look to look into some

131
00:06:34,020 --> 00:06:37,400
products that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> yet to try would be</font>

132
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:39,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">afro beta</font>

136
00:06:49,030 --> 00:06:52,030
other oils and just all around me yummy

137
00:06:52,030 --> 00:06:54,669
sounding things another important<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing</font>

138
00:06:54,669 --> 00:06:56,409
to remember when you're looking at

139
00:06:56,409 --> 00:06:59,379
buying natural or organic you know

140
00:06:59,379 --> 00:07:01,659
mother earth friendly hair products is

141
00:07:01,659 --> 00:07:04,599
<font color="#CCCCCC">that it's very easy to apply</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the rule if</font>

142
00:07:04,599 --> 00:07:08,169
I can't read it it's not natural that

143
00:07:08,169 --> 00:07:11,099
that's not necessarily true because some

144
00:07:11,099 --> 00:07:14,050
products list their ingredients by their

145
00:07:14,050 --> 00:07:18,300
scientific name booty<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> beauty Rose</font>

146
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:23,349
permanent<font color="#E5E5E5"> parka that's shea butter the</font>

147
00:07:23,349 --> 00:07:27,039
name for vitamin E<font color="#CCCCCC"> hmm is tocopheryl</font>

148
00:07:27,039 --> 00:07:31,029
acetate another tidbit if you buy a

149
00:07:31,029 --> 00:07:33,460
manufactured product chances are there's

150
00:07:33,460 --> 00:07:35,229
some<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of preservative in that</font>

151
00:07:35,229 --> 00:07:37,240
product or else it would spoil

152
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:40,229
relatively fast

153
00:07:42,220 --> 00:07:45,130
just keep that<font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> mind as well that was</font>

154
00:07:45,130 --> 00:07:47,950
a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of information and I left a lot</font>

155
00:07:47,950 --> 00:07:50,610
open you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's a really wide</font>

156
00:07:50,610 --> 00:07:54,220
ranging topic but hopefully this you

157
00:07:54,220 --> 00:07:56,260
know gave you a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little taste and maybe</font>

158
00:07:56,260 --> 00:07:58,930
encourage you to you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> dive in to the</font>

159
00:07:58,930 --> 00:08:01,170
research<font color="#CCCCCC"> maybe making</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> your own products</font>

160
00:08:01,170 --> 00:08:04,840
that both helps reduce down on packaging
