it's been 15 years since the US invasion of Iraq and what they have to show for it is a Baghdad looking every day more towards Iran just a year ago it didn't look like Washington was losing ground in Iraq at all taking credit for helping to defeat ISIL having the country's prime minister as a close friend our armed forces have cleared the last pockets of ISIL controlled areas we have just absolutely decimated Isis just absolutely obliterated Isis in Iraq looks like a victory for the red white and blue but times are a-changing Iraq is struggling to form a government and so far they've agreed on sunni lawmaker Mohammad Ali Abu c4 parliament speaker the main thing you need to know about him is that his support comes from a pro Iranian bloc the man in charge even fought for Iran in its war against Iraq it's probably easy to find out where his loyalties reside but what about Washington's yes-man Abadi surely he'll seek a second term and continue business as usual right wrong he's already declared he won't touch a second term with a ten-foot pole I do not want a second term I don't cling to second term will rotate Powell peacefully and the political unrest under his administration hasn't been very encouraging since July riots have ravaged the city of Basra where the government can't even provide basic public services things weren't looking too good for the us's Iraqi friend in power but the protesters are by no means fond of Iran either hundreds attacked Tehran's Embassy in Basra chanting Iran out leaving an inferno in their wake some shifts in Parliament have meant good news for Tehran though a once anti-iranian cleric moqtada al-sadr suddenly had a change of heart an increasingly influential figure in Iraqi politics who initially agreed to support a body is all for a government with a pro I rain block now but what was Trump's special envoy Brett McGurk up to in Iraq there sure were a lot of meetings and talks to win Iraqis back to the right side even his boss Mike Pompeo praised his work just spoke with Brett McGurk who's on the ground in Baghdad representing me and POTUS doing a great job forming a strong Iraqi government or national basis is essential to the enduring defeat of Isis except he didn't do that great of a job as you can see the score still 2/3 Iran Middle East expert Paul Haru believes Iran seeking any potential support to combat the US sanctions Iraqi government basically has access to a lot of the rest of the world's markets in a way that Iran doesn't have and this puts Iraq and the United States in a really difficult situation where you know Iraq you know has been an ally of the United States you know for a number of years but Iran is now seeking to gain more influence in the region the Iranian government is looking for any number of allies that can muster in order to basically work its way around the sanctions that the US has reposed after the joint comprehensive plan of agreement was the United States withdrew from that but this is a big victory strategically for Iran to have both the and the Prime Minister being supportive of the Iranian government you
