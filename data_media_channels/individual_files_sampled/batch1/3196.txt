Rock Paper Scissors shoot you've been using rock-paper-scissors to settle middling disputes for years but winning is all random right oh now RPS strategy is for real let's take a trip to China this is jajang University where a man named Jean Wang has unlocked the game theory behind winning rock-paper-scissors mathematically the best way to play the game is choosing your action randomly in game theory that's called Nash equilibrium but Wang found that players have tendencies based on winning or losing a previous round this is called a conditional response and understanding it lets you exploit your opponent's here's how it works the first round of the best of three is up for grabs each player chooses one of the three options but then things get really interesting there's two simple things you have to know about how people play one if a player wins they'll usually pick the same thing again two if a player loses they'll usually change their strategy and move to the next action in the sequence for example if someone loses with rock they'll most likely play paper next if they lose with paper they'll usually play scissors and so on those two pieces of information are the key to crushing your opponent let's say you find yourself in a heated match everything is on the line round one you play rock your opponent plays paper you're off to a rough start but since they won you know they're likely to play the exact same thing again paper so to win you place scissors boom now it's all knotted at one time to bring it home since they lost last time with paper they're probably going to change actions now to the next in the sequence and what comes after Paper Scissors which means your perfect play is rock congratulations you're now ready to dominate you'll never have to wash the dishes or walk the dog again good luck things they know make you a target one of them is bacteria
