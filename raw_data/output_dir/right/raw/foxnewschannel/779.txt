1
00:00:08,225 --> 00:00:10,628
>> Neil: THEY SAY YOU'RE DEFINED

2
00:00:10,628 --> 00:00:12,229
IN LIFE BUT NOT THINGS THAT GO

3
00:00:12,229 --> 00:00:13,864
WELL BUT THINGS THAT ARE NOT.

4
00:00:13,864 --> 00:00:15,332
THINGS YOU DIDN'T SEE COMING.

5
00:00:15,332 --> 00:00:16,265
FOR CHARLES KRAUTHAMMER, IT WAS

6
00:00:16,265 --> 00:00:17,334
A DIVING ACCIDENT.

7
00:00:17,334 --> 00:00:20,170
HE WAS A 22-YEAR-OLD HARVARD

8
00:00:20,170 --> 00:00:21,238
MEDICAL SCHOOL STUDENT AND HE

9
00:00:21,238 --> 00:00:23,574
TOLD MY COLLEAGUE, BRET BAIER

10
00:00:23,574 --> 00:00:25,542
THAT HE KNEW THE MOMENT THAT HIS

11
00:00:25,542 --> 00:00:28,312
HEAD HIT THE BOTTOM OF THE POOL

12
00:00:28,312 --> 00:00:29,613
HE WAS PARALYZED FOR LIFE.

13
00:00:29,613 --> 00:00:31,315
YOU KNOW THIS STORY.

14
00:00:31,315 --> 00:00:33,651
SO MANY STORIES TOLD BY SO MANY

15
00:00:33,651 --> 00:00:35,552
THAT KNEW CHARLES FAR BETTER

16
00:00:35,552 --> 00:00:36,687
THAN ME AND WORKED WITH CHARLES

17
00:00:36,687 --> 00:00:38,222
FAR LONGER THAN ME.

18
00:00:38,222 --> 00:00:40,457
SO I CAN'T SPEAK FOR THEIR

19
00:00:40,457 --> 00:00:40,924
MEMORIES.

20
00:00:40,924 --> 00:00:43,560
ALLOW ME NOW TO SPEAK FOR MINE.

21
00:00:43,560 --> 00:00:46,930
FEWER BUT JUST AS POWERFUL.

22
00:00:46,930 --> 00:00:49,400
NOTICE AS PERSONAL BUT FOR ME

23
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:50,367
VERY PERSONAL.

24
00:00:50,367 --> 00:00:53,137
WHEN IT CAME TO CHARLES, I

25
00:00:53,137 --> 00:00:55,873
WASN'T JUST A VIEWER.

26
00:00:55,873 --> 00:00:56,807
I WAS A VOYEUR.

27
00:00:56,807 --> 00:00:58,008
THAT'S WHAT WE DO.

28
00:00:58,008 --> 00:01:00,644
WE WATCH OTHERS DO WHAT THEY DO,

29
00:01:00,644 --> 00:01:02,479
ESPECIALLY THOSE THAT ARE GOOD

30
00:01:02,479 --> 00:01:04,081
AT WHAT THEY DO OR SHOULD DO.

31
00:01:04,081 --> 00:01:05,416
CHARLES WAS REALLY GOOD AT WHAT

32
00:01:05,416 --> 00:01:06,283
HE DID.

33
00:01:06,283 --> 00:01:10,854
WHAT AMAZED ME IS HOW HE DID IT.

34
00:01:10,854 --> 00:01:13,624
I MARVELLED AT HIS MANNER.

35
00:01:13,624 --> 00:01:17,361
BUT MORE, I MARVELLED AT HIS

36
00:01:17,361 --> 00:01:17,695
MANNERS.

37
00:01:17,695 --> 00:01:20,764
HE NEVER SCREAMED OR NEVER

38
00:01:20,764 --> 00:01:21,098
YELLED.

39
00:01:21,098 --> 00:01:27,571
HE NEVER IMPUGNED THE INTEGRITY

40
00:01:27,571 --> 00:01:28,372
OF ANYBODY.

41
00:01:28,372 --> 00:01:33,010
JUST A ZEAL THAT IMPRESSED BOTH

42
00:01:33,010 --> 00:01:33,310
SIDES.

43
00:01:33,310 --> 00:01:35,112
HE GOT YOUR ATTENTION BECAUSE HE

44
00:01:35,112 --> 00:01:35,813
GOT LIFE.

45
00:01:35,813 --> 00:01:37,047
MAYBE BECAUSE HE GOT THE

46
00:01:37,047 --> 00:01:38,515
FRAGILITY OF LIFE.

47
00:01:38,515 --> 00:01:41,085
IN A WAY MOST CONSERVATIVES

48
00:01:41,085 --> 00:01:43,153
COULD NOT AND CANNOT AND MOST

49
00:01:43,153 --> 00:01:44,955
LIBERALS INSIST THEY ARE BUT ARE

50
00:01:44,955 --> 00:01:45,255
NOT.

51
00:01:45,255 --> 00:01:46,924
THAT WAS THE CHARLES KRAUTHAMMER

52
00:01:46,924 --> 00:01:48,058
THAT I KNEW.

53
00:01:48,058 --> 00:01:50,094
THAT WAS GOOD ENOUGH FOR ME.

54
00:01:50,094 --> 00:01:51,962
THAT WAS INSPIRING ENOUGH FOR

55
00:01:51,962 --> 00:01:52,296
ME.

56
00:01:52,296 --> 00:01:54,198
IT WAS POSSIBLE TO MAKE A POINT

57
00:01:54,198 --> 00:01:56,800
WITHOUT MORPHING INTO A SHORT

58
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:58,268
FEST THAT TURNED POINTLESS.

59
00:01:58,268 --> 00:01:59,570
THAT WAS HIS SECRET.

60
00:01:59,570 --> 00:02:01,171
HE HAD NO SECRET.

61
00:02:01,171 --> 00:02:02,139
THAT WAS HIS GAME.

62
00:02:02,139 --> 00:02:04,241
HE PLAYED NO GAMES.

63
00:02:04,241 --> 00:02:05,509
EVERYONE HAS BEEN SAYING WHAT

64
00:02:05,509 --> 00:02:07,745
YOU SAW IS WHAT YOU GOT WITH

65
00:02:07,745 --> 00:02:08,078
CHARLES.

66
00:02:08,078 --> 00:02:09,947
A MAN WHO HAD BEEN THROUGH SO

67
00:02:09,947 --> 00:02:11,615
MUCH, BUT YOU WOULDN'T KNOW IT

68
00:02:11,615 --> 00:02:12,382
UNLESS YOU ASKED.

69
00:02:12,382 --> 00:02:16,720
HE WOULDN'T TELL YOU MUCH EVEN

70
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:17,421
IF YOU PUSHED.

71
00:02:17,421 --> 00:02:20,257
IT'S HOW HE HANDSELED THE THINGS

72
00:02:20,257 --> 00:02:23,694
THAT WENT WELL JUST LIKES THE

73
00:02:23,694 --> 00:02:25,262
THINGS THAT DID NOT.

74
00:02:25,262 --> 00:02:26,530
HE WAS DEALING WITH THE CARDS

75
00:02:26,530 --> 00:02:27,231
THAT HE WAS DEALT.

76
00:02:27,231 --> 00:02:28,832
THE MAN THAT REFUSED TO BE

77
00:02:28,832 --> 00:02:31,201
DEFINED BY THE LEGS HE COULDN'T

78
00:02:31,201 --> 00:02:33,637
USE BUT THE REMARKABLE BRAIN

79
00:02:33,637 --> 00:02:35,172
THAT HE DID.

80
00:02:35,172 --> 00:02:36,640
BRIT HUME SAID CHARLES WAS AN

81
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:39,209
UNLIKELY MEDIA MEGASTAR.

82
00:02:39,209 --> 00:02:40,778
IT'S HIS UNLIKELINESS THAT MADE

83
00:02:40,778 --> 00:02:43,046
HIM A MEDIA MEGASTAR.

84
00:02:43,046 --> 00:02:44,615
HE SPOKE VOLUMES SOMETIMES

85
00:02:44,615 --> 00:02:46,049
WITHOUT SPEAKING MUCH AT ALL.

86
00:02:46,049 --> 00:02:48,952
THE QUIET MAN AT THE TABLE THAT

87
00:02:48,952 --> 00:02:49,686
RULED THE TABLE.

88
00:02:49,686 --> 00:02:52,990
NOW LIKE YOU, ALL I CAN FOCUS ON

89
00:02:52,990 --> 00:02:55,826
IS THE EMPTY SPACE AT THE TABLE

90
00:02:55,826 --> 00:00:00,000
AND THE SILENCE IS DEAFENING.
