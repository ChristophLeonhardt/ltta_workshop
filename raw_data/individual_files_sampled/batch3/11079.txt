hello and welcome to crosstalk where all things are considered I'm Peter labelled with the appointment of John Bolton is the new National Security Advisor should we expect more stupid Wars of choice Trump says he wants success but everything associated with Bolton's name is a failure the war party is again in charge crosstalking the war party I'm joined by my guest mark sloboda he's an international affairs and security analyst we also have Victor Levesque is a political analyst as well as a leading expert at the center for actual politics and of course we have Dimitri Babaji is a political analyst with Sputnik International all right gentlemen as always cross dr. rules in effect that means you can jump in anytime you want and I always appreciate it John Bolton two words that I never thought would be associated with a position of power again considering his legacy Victor your reaction to this news that's a ripples through the foreign policy establishment and what we call international diplomacy five years ago everybody would be shocked if they were told that John Bolton would get a respectable position in government again he was a Fox News analyst commentator and that actually played a significant role in his new hire Donald Trump truly seems to like to hire those people that see nice things about him on Fox News or some other networks at the same time I mean Bob Bolton is it in trouble at odds on almost just everything possible if you look at it policy well smart it's certainly there at odds with what Trump indicated he wanted his foreign policy to be when he was running his campaign now when he spoke against regime change against nation-building against democracy promotion but the the Trump that we've seen in office we've seen an increasing tilt not only to Awards Warhawks right as evidenced by the cabal of generals running the government but now right into the the laps of the neo cons and if this is in the okan regime right now with Pompeo the volcano at Secretary of State bloody Gina Gina Haspel whom even supposedly in the CIA because of her role hands-on in the torture of detainees they call her bloody Gina and and now the walrus is back John Bolton the circle is it's like we're at we're at neocon regime it could only mean if this Dino team at me but Bolton really isn't a neocon and it would makes him more interesting if not more terrifying is that he doesn't care about democracy he doesn't care about human rights he doesn't see he doesn't use all of the packaging for for military adventures okay he believes he doesn't want to make America great again he believes in the military that's his and he's very straightforward about it that's what makes him slightly different than his cohort go ahead well I just loved his coat all international Wars are meaningless attempts to constrain American power and of Poland he was the UFO represented the United States at the United Nations I mean if anyone could explain to me the difference between neoconservatives and the neoliberals I mean does it make any difference for a person in Afghanistan or in Iraq if he is killed by a missile that missile came from someone who just believes in American power or it came from Hillary Clinton who believes in American power at the service of universal liberal values okay so make any difference DeMuth neoliberal is an economic policy it has nothing to do with foreign policy okay specifically here I mean we have Trump making an overture to meeting the North Korean leader both in his gonna advise him against that I mean is this going to be the first test look I think we started talking about this meeting proposed meeting between Trump and and Kim jong-eun we said one of the things we said was that the meeting may not even take place it may be a rhetorical exercise for various political purposes and when we talk about Bolton and Trump well they were on the same wavelength on at least one issue and that's the issue dealing with Iran and Bolton and had said had been very aggressive considering Iran he had openly advocated attacks when they run military aggression exist in one month ago he said it wouldn't be it would not be illegal under international first strike against not in fact what separated Tillerson McMaster from the rest of terms military and security team was that Tillerson and McMaster actually believed that again the u.s. Union a unilateral withdrawal from the nuclear deal with Iran would hurt the mood here at American diplomacy in the long run because who would trust American diplomacy if a new administration could just erase that signature and then the very possibility on any kind of deal with North Korea is off the table because if you make an agreement and you break it you break exactly you're not gonna be yes your word isn't gonna be trusted here market Trump is never I mean from what we've seen of him during the campaign and his presidency he never allow us anyone to outshine him his bolton's ego too big to fit into this position does he want to be a Kissinger or Brzezinski well certainly he does have an ego but I think we actually present more of his ego he presents a larger-than-life figure for us than he does he displays he is a bureaucrat he doesn't know his place he knows when to kiss whose but in order to get to literally spit out he has a history of don't agree that he's nude on me not a neocon I don't think that the O'Neal cons have ever believed in democracy or promotion that was simply a useful point that's why I don't call him in neo come because the neo cons have their propaganda space he doesn't have any pretense to that I think he supposedly promised drama the CNN is reporting that he wouldn't start any new Wars I mean Obama has already got nine of them going the bombing nine countries at least so I mean Trump already inherited that but I find that extremely hard isn't that an amazing way to announce to the public don't start a war you know new Texas he's obviously through his career he has contempt for diplomacy and I've been saying this all along it's part of the genetic code of foreign policy right now is it you just need an administrator at Foggy Bottom you don't need to have a diplomat and the kind of options that Bolton is going to be giving Trump I have to believe it's going to be a reflection if it's an entire outlook on the world and it's a you say well would it I think political call him you know he's a hammer in search of nails absolutely well I just picture this situation Boulton and the room the negotiating room of Donald Trump and Kim jong-nam and he says to kim general i am the person who just suggested killing your bump in you but don't pay any attention to that but going to have a nice conversation here but you know the problem is whatever you call it libero interventionism neoconservatism the bad thing about this ideology is that it doesn't value in any way the lives of the people who don't agree with it you know just recently this you know in Damascus the missile killed at a market place 37 people you know the car school traffic explosion there was almost no reaction from the Western media will remember how Sarajevo was was bombed by the by the by the Serb military forces and you know all the hysteria about marketplaces you know being destroyed you know bodies littering the floor at these marketplaces the same thing happened in Damascus and and no one paid attention from the rebels from the revenue so that missile came from Sirius been brought up here and III think that there in many ways is there's some kind of ambiguity in this white Trump White House about Syria do you think that's gonna get much more focused right now that you know Bolton is going to be you know may pull the CIA back in officially and other thing what's what the new national security team in Washington has in common is their common approach to Iran and of course that is going to be a major part in what happens in Syria because Russia and Iran are allies in their fight to stabilize Syria to remove radical Islamist elements from Syria and the United States will do the utmost to keep those elements in as long as possible there was a an interesting intelligence analysis an open one a public one done in the u.s. a couple of months ago which stated that the so-called moderate opposition is she has about a year to go so if the United States and its allies are able to put more energy into them more funds and so forth maybe a year maybe a year and a half more so they will try to use that time to destabilize here as much as possible with those resources that they still have left now one short comment about the comparison between John Bolton and Kissinger and Brzezinski Kerry Kissinger and Brzezinski were known as foreign policy intellectuals John Bolton is usually not he is a high-flying diplomat military stick very aggressive diplomat who is not an Kennedy met Khrushchev Kennedy's response was Khrushchev negotiates what's mine is mine is what's yours is negotiable mark I want to go to you because you brought this up a number of times since the election we have the US State Department putting pressure on the Europeans particularly Germany for the Nord Stream to pipeline now we have the the the Iran deal the Europeans were being pressured to change it now it looks like the Americans gonna walk away from a completely why would that Europeans want to be involved in that I mean this is the two example I just run still pushing the division is growing growing yeah the Europeans don't like Bolton and I mean they don't like this treatment of the UN international law anything there so this is actually not only enemies that will grow but I don't think that concerns the u.s. the u.s. under you know this this new triumvirate of Bolton bloody Jena and Pompeyo the volcano will be happy start well I think he's on his way him and Kelly he's got a nickname I think they're on their way out there to sane and moderate on military matters it may take six months but I think they're both gone so I Iran Iran Iran this is what Bolton will push all right he it in a celebration of the terrorist former terrorist group now recycled by the u.s. they've removed their terrorist designation the m EK mu jihad the next part of the program i want to ask you is this also wedge against russia using iran is that part of the equation sure that's part of the equation and and certainly russia simply existing the United States and Syria Boulton is is a cult of American supremacy exceptionalism he cannot tolerate that some Democrats have suggested that Bolton is too soft on Russia for them which is a is amazing that's pretty amazing but it both never met a an exercise of US military power and foreign power that he doesn't like hold that thought gentlemen we're gonna go to a short break and after that short break we'll continue our discussion on the war party stay with RT welcome back to crosstalk where all things are considered I'm Peter Lavelle to remind you we're discussing some real news okay Mike I want to go back to you right before we went to the break you were talking about Boulton Iran and regime change go ahead yeah the Mujahideen a calque is is a terrorist group it was formerly formerly designated by the United States as a terrorist group it targets Iran they are they have extremely extremist views they were sheltered in Iraq then the u.s. took them under its wing after its invasion and occupation of rack of Iraq and rehabilitated them and now they openly hold meetings and they've got a million dollar war chest the lobbying Washington's and John Bolton is one of their favorite advocates right he recently spoke at a gathering of the MEA in in the United States and he he promised two things first he wanted to make sure that the the government the Iranian government that was put in place during the Islamic Revolution doesn't reach its 40th birthday yeah and also he promised them that we will celebrate 2019 meaning him and these terrorists in Tehran which you know like some kind of valve curse is this pattern of regime change I still have said it so many times so many years it's the genic genetic code of American foreign policy it doesn't matter who's in office but with Bolton you're gonna he doesn't hold any punches here victory you know the United States has already chosen decided who will be ruling Iran by the end of next year amazing Bolton's exhortations remind me of a piece from Robert Gates memoirs where he talks about having a one person victory parade in the red square in 1991 but but Bolton's dreams are not about to come true he may become the national security adviser to trump which was really seemed unlikely just a few years ago but Iran's government is going to be chosen by Iran's people just like before and not by the Hawks in Washington DC let's change gears here Dima let's talk about what's going on in the UK we have with this alleged poisoning incident I would still like to see some kind of public evidence made to the public so we could start drawing some real situation apology yeah and I guess so because I really believe 500 years of Western Europe jurisprudence okay you're innocent until proven guilty but that is different it's always different you know you should have spectacles as Nabokov would have sent you know the UK has that excellent agent his name is highly likely you know like highly Wyclef set on the wall highly likely had a great fall and the problem is that the EU believes it too because if we read the you statement taken two days ago it is the Union agrees with the UK government assessment that it's highly likely that the Russian Federation is responsible and that there is no plan there's no possible 12 explanation we wished so we stirred in and qualified solidarity with the UK no plausible alternative explanation even the Holy Inquisition I have to wonder then with this confab of your European Union leaders were they presented with evidence to come up with that kind of language I doubt it in our world perception is reality and with the Russa phobic anti-russian massive campaign in the Western media with the information sphere being flooded with anti-russian MEMS and information this type of response is to be expected because now you don't have to present any evidence whatsoever to to have a conclusion that Russia responsible for anything and that is the great danger in this that anything could happen tomorrow the next day the week so now all the president when the British and they make it work is straight you think and then blame Russia for you know not only Russia Slovakia you know crazy idea came into my head here mister SME using this to avoid brinson breaks it sure there's I think there is a whole host of of domestic uses whether that is the actual reason that this has occurred or whether she's simply using on to yet scene she's distracting from brexit it's not going well the country half the country never wanted it and the negotiations aren't going well for her plus far more dangerous because of all of this you have this leftist labor leader who has resisted all attempts by new Labor's elite to overthrow him who would dramatically shift the United Kingdom's foreign and possibly much of its domestic policy as well and this seems tailor-made we've seen the propaganda photoshop's from from the the the British propaganda corporate I mean British Broadcasting Corporation in order to defame Jeremy Corbyn and present him as some kind of Russian agent really tells me I want to say this to all of you is that this is desperation this is a mode of desperation no evidence is provided there is a no interest in finding the truth because the truth has already been established because well Russia did it here I mean this is that it shows a level of desperation of the political elites that will grab on to anything go ahead but the victim of this desperation is the relationship between Russia and Europe and Russia and the rest of the West because we we are seeing that already more than a dozen countries is contemplating exploring Russian diplomats next week in the United States the National Security Council has presented its recommendations to Donald Trump about expelling dozens of Russian diplomats from Washington DC and of course if that happens this Monday you know in Russia a lot of people had this perception that the United States is bad it makes Europe behave badly towards Russia well this week has shown the EU is bad enough on its own they can do it and let me tell you you know from history all the disastrous things that Europe did were done collectively look the Napoleonic Wars two invasions of Russia the colonial wars the stewards crisis they were all done collectively so when they say now that we need strong collective action on scrip our case that reminds me of the worst pages in European history whole Inquisition was done collectively look the EU of course please part of getting them all together getting the European powers together and forcing them to make decisions that are very frequently not in their national sanctions of course if we talk about specific European countries the number of European countries are not interested in worsening relations with Russia when push come to shove it is um how many countries would come least one maybe five or six but it's not that they're being railroaded and you've seen a lot of statements macron evidently initially resisted this whole thing saying that there had to be evidence then turned around the next day when the screws mamon for the German Foreign Minister you know it is on record saying that this is a bilateral issue it's not an EU issue it's something for Britain and Russia to rule yeah because they're exiting the EU general I wanted talking about a very important topic here we have a massive budget passed and signed into law in the United States a huge military budget here they thank you what is the side of the mantra is that Obama degraded the military I'm sure all those countries that were bombed by the United States wouldn't agree with that statement here but now this is going to be a massive buildup as usual the Pentagon doesn't usually spend very well but it's important at the same time Victor our viewers should know is that Russia has decided over the next five years to decrease military spending Russia is going the different way Russia understands that it does not need to keep on a military presence around the world in dozens and dozens of countries like the United States does Russia does not have a dream of world domination or being the single superpower then Russia has no such motives so it doesn't have unlike the United States it doesn't have to spend trillions and trillions of dollars today is to death yes so Russia understands that it has to give asymmetrical answers to the American threats to it and that is what it does defense is a good offense yes in a lot of ways this is simply because Russia does have very limited geopolitical horizons and uses worse military it's primarily defensive with some limited role for the the interventions like we've seen Russia in defense of the Syrian government in Syria Putin set out a program Putin and the Russian Defense Minister should go set out a program of modernization and that modernization has largely been achieved now that it has been achieved Russia has the luxury to sit back and say we've met our purposes we can sit back and put some more on domestic spending and will reduce military spending down to 3 percent of GDP so we continuing the reform process a few figures here right now right now Russia is spending on his defense in excess of 5 percent of the GDP and all of the candidates for the presidency agreed that it was too much you know we need to cut it and and when did Putin decide to cut it after we got the capacity to hit the United States not by many missiles three or four would be enough you know because Russia doesn't want to invade anyone it works to dissuade the capacity to neutralize the anti-ballistic missile shield or build torrent exactly it's like you know a cold war saying many maybe we'll miss Minneapolis so what we're not going to get all the cities two or three would be enough because we are not going to hit them we don't want to hit them we want security not not domination forty seconds well I I think that what what this indicates first of all it's being read as Russia trying to step back from an arms race again like I said I think this has already been planned Russia never really wanted an arms race it has been pushed to this now that it has recovered its strategic deterrent it sees the strategic balance returned with American a mystic ballistic missile defense at least for the time being having neutralized Russia is confident it can return the priorities the biggest priority that Putin laid out is Education Science and Technology I think Russia wants to avoid an arms race because it doesn't want to be outspent so why get into a competition where you can't win Russia is not in the competition with the United States were actually simply trying to provide security for its citizens and to take away opportunities for the United States to attack it without that is all the great powers are in competition it's our point you run out of time many thanks my guests here in Moscow this is the end of our broadcast segment stay with us for the extended version on our YouTube channel see you next time and remember crosstalk rules now for the extended version of our program we have political popery Dima Europe first well I think even Alexander Dumas would not have invented the story that we have witnessed this week with President Sarkozy former president of France and the allegations of his campaign being financed by Qaddafi so he took it off his money and then had him killed well exactly even Alexander Dumas would not have invented it because we all remember count Monte Cristo went after his enemies he didn't go after the country where his enemies lived you know and and the problem is that the story looks more and more possible Sarkozy was interrogated for more than 24 hours with a break for sleep and and the whole story actually was broken back in 2011 by Gaddafi's son sy food Islam who is now probably going to be the president of Libya he gave them all the facts but the mainstream media ignored it why because they needed Sarkozy at the time to topple Qaddafi to destroy Libya now that the war is over Sarkozy is no longer in power they went after this totally amazing how they just this you know dispensed with rank the people they don't drop they serve the Empire and then when you're no longer of service they let me give you a comparison I think they dispense with idea what we just dispensed with persons very easily so the problem is that they treat the people like Sarkozy excuse me like birth control devices or rather state control devices as soon as they don't need them as soon as they don't need Sarkozy media power you know that investigative journalism went after him as soon as Hillary Clinton lost the election she crept up to be a bad candidate you know it was not her ideology that was it was Hillary Clinton herself so that same story repeats itself in the United States in Europe everywhere Europe Europe victory Europe so the futility of the massive anti-gun law protests in the United States that went on in the last couple days hundreds of thousands of people taking part irrespective of the position whether your program or anti-gun rights the the protests will accomplish nothing for two reasons first of all it is very difficult to change the US Constitution especially the amendments that are part of the Bill of Rights in second of all there are so many guns that are owned by America's right now some own dozens of weapons it is simply impossible now to control the weapons that are already that have already been deployed and distributed a no matter how harsh the gun laws are going to be it is going to be impossible to take those weapons of what I find really peculiar about all of this is it's what these protests end up doing is challenging and insulting law-abiding citizens that have done nothing wrong that birthday and they and there is the Second Amendment you have there were the right to bear arms I know I know the literal interpretation of it when it was written with everything but but the Supreme Court has repeatedly upheld the second demand whatever the interpretations against it is realistically it is impossible to get millions and millions and millions of guns of people's that's the ultimate aim in if that's going to be the aim you will have a repeat of the Civil War okay well you know Confucius said that usually the subjects imitate things if John Bolton says that all those are meaningless attempts to limit to constrain the American power then why shouldn't individual citizens behave in the same way as the slave that's certainly how American foreign policy works and restraint you know politicians comment that you know what do we care if Americans use their guns to kill each other we're not going to institute a similar a similar disaster response it could gun control laws in this country in Russia very sensible you have to have a psych test you have the medical test I mean you have to have a clean record I mean it works it works here in a way shift gears the the tragic comedy horror farce that is the Ukraine since it was an update since the us-backed pooch overthrew the government in 2014 Nadia Savchenko she was a former Ukrainian military pilot who then joined the the as the even the Western press and the US government once admitted the the Azoff neo-nazi battalion she joined that to attack the citizens of Donbass after the government was overthrown in the attempt to subjugate East Ukraine to this new regime as well she was a part of this she was captured by the military forces in the don boss when she was doing some sabotage activities possibly involving the death of Russian journalists there she was heralded as the Joan of Arc of Ukraine by Western media she was she was discussed and in the EU everywhere as some kind of feminist role model some some regional here yeah well she two stories lastly because she's a crook versus kook first she has she then she became an MP a member of parliament in the Ukrainian push Rada she in the last few weeks has admitted one that she knows that some of the madhan's neo-fascist leaders whether it was Peru B Andhra of Peru B who is now the Speaker of the Parliament a speaker of the Rada or someone else but snipers in right to kill both members of the police the BIR coats and the protesters in order to inflame the situation the the expected false flag that we all talked about that it completely ignored by the Western press now Joan of Arc has been arrested by the same government that she helped put in power this time supposedly for plotting a coup a terrorist coup to overthrow the government which she admitted she says I'd like to over that's no actually the the accusations that were made against here are completely implausible what dissidents to make sure to make sure of viewers understand what she's been accused of by here on government of wanting to come to the building to blow up the top then come in with grenades and kill the deputies essentially by herself so if that sounds possible to you pretty actually is that she wants the government removed of course she nobody really could believe that if you just step back okay we have the regime in camp now they got there through illegal means so that gives legitimacy to other people to continue accidentally maseeh and illegality this is and then this is where it sits you know the the the zero hour for that regime that's a very dangerous precedent for it's it's a continuation there is a one interesting twist to that story she's still a member of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe she was elected there when she was still in the Russian jail and now the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe is asking Russia why don't you want to be a part of us why we deprive you of your vote in that Parliamentary Assembly we have that excellent deputy who is accidentally now in the Ukrainian jail but why aren't you part of us is upset the thrush isn't paying its dues even though Russia has no voice absolutely but the problem is then why Russian the Western media is she's your Joan of Arc of Ukrainian are you so quiet almost out of time here a big brouhaha Trump called Putin and congratulated him God I'm in a lot of hot water again why did he do it alright why did he do it that's that that's his his own foreign policy his ideas of date on have you or simply expected congratulations to another great power leader but supposedly it was leaked all across the media his national security policy his own national security adviser instructed him this is the words the press used at first the AP and others instructed Trump do in big capital bold letters do not congratulate Vladimir Putin first of all there are certainly allowed to give him that advice he chose not to follow it but to me it what inflamed him and what possibly led to his immediate he already had it long planned but immediate dismissal of McMasters and replacing him with a Bolton is this this wording instructed the President of the United States this is this is deep straight instructions they said this is a really good point that's why I have to wonder if Trump will have a very different national security adviser by the end of the year beginning of next year because I don't he doesn't take the kind of it he doesn't accept that kind of advice from anyone there is an interesting twist to the story also I'm given Mirko congratulate at Putin and was not lambasted for that Trump was lambasted by what four times Putin was elected four times why why why I can tell you again the United States and the European Union are ruled by the same ultra liberal ideology Merkel Express she kind of inspires no doubt about her religion she's the leader of the free world so she can that congratulate Putin right Trump has never been certified as the leader of the free world so he could not congratulate Putin and if he can graduates Putin then John Brennan the former X you know ex CIA chief he has suspicions that the president could be compromised by Moscow and become an asset for the Kremlin look anything Russia is immediately interpreted by the American mass media and by parts of the security apparatus as being pro-russian against the national interests of the United States the truth of the matter is Putin congratulate the trampled he got elected president and term simply returned protocol there is nothing special about it there was no deterrent under a trump and there isn't going to be done between the US and Russia and their attempt so the final outrage of the week back to the United Kingdom and Russia spat Boris Johnson the the Foreign Minister of the United Kingdom compared Russia holding the World Cup this year to Hitler holding the Olympics in 1936 it was disgusting I think perhaps he might have missed out in history class or or maybe they just don't teach it in the UK where the Soviet Union boycotted the 36 Olympics and the United Kingdom not only did not but the Tory government in power then had the British football team and you know you can find the pictures out there dude Kayal to Hitler along with the German team to congratulate Hitler there so so Bojo yeah epic fail okay you know you shouldn't play hooky when it comes to history classes can they can help you some time here all right that's all the time we have for our extended version I hope you enjoyed it we'll see you next week and remember crosstalk rules
