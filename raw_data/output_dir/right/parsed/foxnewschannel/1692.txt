>> MAKE NO MISTAKE.
HAMAS IS PLEASED WITH THE
RESULTS FROM YESTERDAY.
I ASK MY COLLEAGUES HERE IN
THE SECURITY COUNCIL WHO
AMONG US WOULD ACCEPT THIS
TYPE OF ACTIVITY ON YOUR
BORDER?
NO ONE WOULD.
NO COUNTRY IN THIS CHAMBER
WOULD ACT WITH MORE
RESTRAINT THAN ISRAEL HAS.
IN FACT, THE RECORDS OF
SEVERAL COUNTRIES HERE TODAY
SUGGEST THEY WOULD BE MUCH
LESS RESTRAINED.
THOSE WHO SUGGEST THAT THE
GAZA VIOLENCE HAS ANYTHING
TO DO WITH THE LOCATION OF
THE AMERICAN EMBASSY ARE
SORELY MISTAKEN.
RATHER THE VIOLENCE COMES
FROM THOSE WHO REJECT THE
EXISTENCE OF THE STATE OF
ISRAEL IN ANY LOCATION.
STEVE: THERE HAVE YOU GOT
THE UNITED STATES AMBASSADOR
TO THE UNITED NATIONS NIKKI
HALEY YESTERDAY AT AN
EMERGENCY SESSION OF THE
SECURITY COUNCIL CALLED FOR
BY THE COUNTRY OF KUWAIT
AFTER 60 PALESTINIANS WERE
KILLED A DAY BEFORE IN THIS
STAND OFF BETWEEN GAZA AND
ISRAEL.
ALAN DERSHOWITZ WAS ACTUALLY
IN GAZA LAST WEEK.
HE ALSO MET WITH BENJAMIN
NETANYAHU THE LAST COUPLE OF
DAYS.
AND HE JOINS US LIVE FROM
TEL AVIV.
PROFESSOR, THANK YOU VERY
MUCH FOR JOINING US.
YOU KNOW, ISRAEL HAS BEEN
PAINTED BY THE MEDIA AS HAVE
BEEN THE AGGRESSOR IN THIS.
>> WELL, THAT'S THE HAMAS
TACTIC.
IT'S CALLED THE DEAD BABY
STRATEGY.
YOU USE CHILDREN AND WOMEN.
YOU DELIBERATELY PUT THEM ON
THE FRONT LINES.
YOU MAKE IT IMPOSSIBLE FOR
ISRAEL TO DEFEND ITSELF
WITHOUT OCCASIONALLY KILLING
A WOMAN OR CHILD OR ELDERLY
PERSON.
EVERY TIME ISRAEL ACCIDENTLY
KILLS SOMEBODY LIKE THAT.
ISRAELIS GRIEVE.
ISRAEL LOSES.
HAMAS CHEERS AND CELEBRATES
BECAUSE THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT
THEY WANT.
THEY WANT THE MEDIA TO SHOW
THE BODY COUNT.
THEY WANT THE MEDIA TO SHOW
THE DEAD BABY EVEN THOUGH
ISRAEL TRIED EVERYTHING IN
ITS POWER TO AVOID CIVILIAN
CASUALTIES.
AMBASSADOR HALEY WAS
ABSOLUTELY CORRECT WHEN SHE
SAID THAT EVERY ONE OF THOSE
DEATHS IS ATTRIBUTEDDABLE TO
HAMAS AND EVERY COUNTRY IN
THE WESTERN WORLD WOULD HAVE
DONE EXACTLY THE SAME.
I WAS DOWN THERE IN GAZA.
I MET WITH PEOPLE AND I MET
WITH THE SOLDIERS.
THEY ARE TERRIFIED ABOUT
40,000 PEOPLE WITH ARMS AND
WITH MOLOTOV COCKTAILS
BREAKING DOWN THE FENCE.
MURDERING ISRAELI CHILDREN.
TAKING HOSTAGES AND TAKING
PEOPLE WHO THEY CAN THEN
EXCHANGE FOR PRISONERS.
ISRAEL DID EXACTLY WHAT
AMERICA IS DOING AND THE
WORLD OUGHT TO CONDEMN A,
HAMAS AND ALSO THE MEDIA
THAT INCENTIVIZES AND
ENCOURAGES HAMAS TO DO THIS
BY REPORTING IN SUCH A
BIASED MANNER.
ABBY: UNFORTUNATELY WE SEE
THAT ALL TOO OFTEN TODAY
WITH THE MEDIA'S REPORTING
SHOWS A MUCH DIFFERENT
REALITY FROM WHAT'S GOING ON
ON THE GROUND.
YOU MET ABOUT B. NETANYAHU
AS STEVE SAID.
WHAT DID YOU TWO TALK ABOUT
YESTERDAY.
WHAT DID HE SAY?
>> WELL, HE IS DESPERATELY
TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WAYS TO
REDUCE THE NUMBER OF
AND EVERYBODY KNOWS THAT
EVERY TIME ISRAEL
INADVERTENTLY KILLS AN
INNOCENT PERSON, IT LOSES.
IT LOSES THE MORAL HIGH
GROUND.
IT LOSES AMONG ITS OWN
PEOPLE.
AND, YET, THE MEDIA
ENCOURAGES THIS AND HE IS
TRYING TO DEVELOP NONLETHAL
WAYS OF DOING THIS.
AND THERE ARE MANY IN THE
WORKS BUT THEY WILL TAKE
SOME TIME.
WE ALSO TALKED ABOUT, YOU
KNOW, THE IRAN DEAL, WE
TALKED ABOUT THE MOVING OF
THE EMBASSY TO JERUSALEM.
I WAS THERE.
IT WAS A GREAT EVENT.
THE EMBASSY SHOULD HAVE BEEN
MOVED TO JERUSALEM 70 YEARS
AGO.
EVERY COUNTRY BUT ISRAEL HAD
THE RIGHT TO NAME ITS OWN
CAPITAL.
BUT FOR YEARS AMERICA WOULD
NOT ALLOW ISRAEL TO NAME ITS
OWN CAPITAL.
FINALLY THEY HAVE DONE THAT
AND THAT WAS A GOOD THING.
BRIAN: ALAN, THERE IS A LOT
OF PEOPLE HERE, PRETTY
STUNNED THAT THEY'RE
CRITICIZING IVANKA FOR
SMILING DURING THE OPENING
OF THE EMBASSY WHILE THERE
ARE RIOTS ON THE GAZA
BORDER.
I FIND THAT UNTHINKABLE AND
TOTALLY DISTASTEFUL THAT
THEY WOULD SAY YOU CAN'T
SMILE AT THIS HISTORIC EVENT
WHEN YOU ARE REPRESENTING
AMERICA?
I SMILED, JOE LIEBERMAN WHO
WAS SITTING NEXT TO ME
SMILED.
PEOPLE BOTH FROM ALL SIDES
OF THE POLITICAL SPECTRUM
SMILED.
IT WAS A GREAT EVENT.
IT WAS AN HISTORIC EVENT.
FINALLY AMERICA RECOGNIZES
THAT JERUSALEM HAS BEEN AND
ALWAYS WILL BE ISRAEL'S
CAPITAL.
IT WAS A WONDERFUL EVENT.
OBVIOUSLY MANY OF US WERE
THINKING ABOUT THE TRAGEDIES
OCCURRING IN GAZA AND IN
SYRIA.
I WAS ALSO UP AT THE SYRIA
BURDEN.
I WAS AT THE BARB WIRE.
I COULD HEAR THE BOMBS GOING
OFF JUST MILES AWAY.
I WAS JUST 100 YARDS AWAY
FROM THE IRON DOME WHICH
STOPPED ROCKETS FROM IRAN
COMING AND KILLING ISRAELI
CIVILIANS ON THE GOLAN.
ISRAEL FACES ENEMIES ALL
OVER.
IT WAS ABOUT TIME THERE WAS
A CELEBRATION IN JERUSALEM
IN WEST JERUSALEM WHICH IS
THE JEWISH NEIGHBORHOOD OF
JERUSALEM FINALLY MOVING THE
EMBASSY THERE.
IT WAS THE RIGHT DECISION BY
PRESIDENT TRUMP.
IT WAS THE RIGHT EVENT.
THE EVENT WAS WONDERFUL.
I'M GLAD IVANKA SMILED.
I'M GLAD JARED KUSHNER GAVE
A WONDERFUL SPEECH TALKING
ABOUT HOW THIS DOESN'T
REDUCE THE PROSPECTS FOR
PEACE.
IT ONLY MAKES THE PROSPECTS
OF PEACE GREATER BECAUSE
THERE IS NOW AN INCENTIVE ON
BOTH SIDES TO COME TO THE
BARGAINING TABLE.
THE PALESTINIANS CAN HAVE
THEIR OWN CAPITAL IN EAST
JERUSALEM.
THEY CAN'T GET A STATE
UNLESS THEY COME TO THE
BARGAINING TABLE.
AND I HOPE THEY WILL FINALLY
NOT MISS ANOTHER
OPPORTUNITIES TO MISS AN
OPPORTUNITY AS THEY DID IN
1938 AND 1948 AND 2000, 2001
AND 2008.
THEY NEVER COME TO THE
BARGAINING TABLE.
THEY ARE NOT GOING TO GET A
STATE THROUGH VIOLENCE.
THROUGH SECURITY COUNCIL
RESOLUTIONS.
THROUGH B.B.S.
THEY WILL GET A STATE BY
COMING IN AND NEGOTIATING
AND I HOPE THEY DUAL THAT.
BRIAN: NOT WITH HAMAS.
STEVE: NOBODY KNOWS THE
TOPIC BETTER THAN ALAN
