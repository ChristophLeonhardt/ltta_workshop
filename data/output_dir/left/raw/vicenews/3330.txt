17
00:00:47,070 --> 00:00:49,289
it's excusable<font color="#E5E5E5"> for a person to act that</font>

00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:20,700
person<font color="#CCCCCC"> based</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> his show which you</font>

00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:24,799
<font color="#E5E5E5">assume is him because it's sort of</font>

34
00:01:24,799 --> 00:01:26,759
<font color="#E5E5E5">presenting the light that's about him</font>

35
00:01:26,759 --> 00:01:33,659
but this specifically<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's two sides to</font>

36
00:01:33,659 --> 00:01:36,450
every you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> story and I think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> there's</font>

37
00:01:36,450 --> 00:01:38,430
a lot more<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be said</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I think it's</font>

00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:43,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">from this</font>

40
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:49,170
I was kind of curious<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know therapy's</font>

41
00:01:49,170 --> 00:01:52,560
some sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of awkward you know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> here in</font>

42
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:53,970
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> theater or something like that</font>

43
00:01:53,970 --> 00:01:56,880
<font color="#CCCCCC">because of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the the lingering you know</font>

44
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:58,890
the question<font color="#E5E5E5"> but there</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> wasn't and I</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">there's been enough time between the</font>

48

00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:16,620
with waiting to<font color="#E5E5E5"> have shows until now to</font>
