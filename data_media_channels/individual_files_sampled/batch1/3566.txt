before you buy the new iphone you should decide which version is right for you do you want the iphone 6 or 6 plus and you need 16 64 or 128 gigabytes let's start with the differences between the six and the six plus the biggest difference here is size the iPhone 6 has a 4.7 inch screen it's larger than the 5s the 6 plus has a 5.5 inch screen which is obviously way bigger so keep in mind the six plus probably won't fit in your pants pocket the larger screen is also better quality but it weighs more the cameras on the 6 and the 6 plus are the same except the 6 plus has a stabilizer so if you're like my mom Joyce the queen of the fuzzy iphone pic you may want to spring for the six plus the hardest decision for most people is trying to figure out how much storage they need the best place to start first consider how much storage you already use if you have an iPhone go to settings and you can see how much storage your pictures video and music take up but here are some general estimates a 64 gigabyte device can hold about 28,000 photos or 7,000 songs or 32 hours of video but apps take up space to the average app maybe only about 30 megabytes but there are some apps that take up a lot of space particularly intense gaming apps where some are over 1 gigabyte each now for the big news you used to have to pay two hundred dollars more to get a 64 gigabyte iphone now 64 gigabytes only costs one hundred dollars more plus you can store some of your content on the cloud and Apple has lowered its iCloud prices the first five gigabytes of iCloud storage is free but if you need more you can get 200 gigabytes for forty-eight dollars a year of course deciding between the six and the sixth plus comes down to a personal preference for me I want something I can fit in my pocket so I'm going with an iPhone 6 as for size the 128 gigabyte device is the best value per byte but it's only a good value for you if you need the space so this is only necessary for hardcore gamers and anyone that wants to keep their entire video collection on their actual device for me 64 gigabytes is a sweet spot I won't run out of space but even if I do I can move some of my stuff to the cloud the 16 gigabyte version is really only for people who are good about keeping their phone squeaky clean this might be enough space if you regularly delete apps and content store on the cloud word of warning just don't store your naked pictures on the cloud keep those on your actual device or don't take them at all what flights are both me
