Vikram Gandhi went to Africa<font color="#CCCCCC"> and Vietnam</font>

2
00:00:02,100 --> 00:00:04,470
to see what's<font color="#E5E5E5"> behind the huge demand for</font>

3
00:00:04,470 --> 00:00:07,710
illegally poach rhino horn this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> his</font>

4
00:00:07,710 --> 00:00:19,140
debrief as far as<font color="#E5E5E5"> I know poachers are</font>

5
00:00:19,140 --> 00:00:21,960
always killing rhinos and<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> reason is</font>

6
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:24,720
because<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's so much harder to actually</font>

7
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:27,570
tranquilizer<font color="#CCCCCC"> rhino have it lie down and</font>

8
00:00:27,570 --> 00:00:29,730
then to cut the horn off it's much

9
00:00:29,730 --> 00:00:31,199
harder to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do that than it is to just</font>

10
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:34,680
shoot a rhino and therefore poachers who

11
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:37,230
are looking to sell rhino horn to

12
00:00:37,230 --> 00:00:41,309
traders to trade in Southeast Asia they

13
00:00:41,309 --> 00:00:43,469
are often shooting them with rifles and

14
00:00:43,469 --> 00:00:45,899
then<font color="#E5E5E5"> using machete to cut off the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> rhino</font>

15
00:00:45,899 --> 00:00:47,399
horn I<font color="#E5E5E5"> would imagine the very few</font>

16
00:00:47,399 --> 00:00:49,530
poachers would actually be keeping no

17
00:00:49,530 --> 00:00:51,030
rhinos alive because it's nearly

18
00:00:51,030 --> 00:00:52,949
impossible to remove the rhino horn

19
00:00:52,949 --> 00:00:54,660
without killing<font color="#E5E5E5"> it who are having it</font>

20
00:00:54,660 --> 00:00:58,590
fully try poised rhino horn is normally

21
00:00:58,590 --> 00:01:02,010
consumed in a powder form and usually

22
00:01:02,010 --> 00:01:05,519
it's ground up in a rhino horn grinding

23
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:07,619
plate which you can buy in places like

24
00:01:07,619 --> 00:01:11,100
Hanoi and it's not snorted which some

25
00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:14,100
people imagine it might be it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> usually</font>

26
00:01:14,100 --> 00:01:16,500
poured into a glass of<font color="#E5E5E5"> water or some</font>

27
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:18,330
other kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of liquid but normally water</font>

28
00:01:18,330 --> 00:01:21,330
and then people<font color="#E5E5E5"> do shots or sip it I did</font>

29
00:01:21,330 --> 00:01:23,220
not taste rhino horn and so I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't know</font>

30
00:01:23,220 --> 00:01:25,350
the specific<font color="#E5E5E5"> taste but I hear if</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

31
00:01:25,350 --> 00:01:27,780
grind up fingernails or toenails and put

32
00:01:27,780 --> 00:01:29,240
them into water you'll have a similar

33
00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:32,130
taste because rhino horn is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the same</font>

34
00:01:32,130 --> 00:01:35,289
material as the human finger now

35
00:01:35,289 --> 00:01:38,990
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> Vietnam there is a lot of fake right</font>

36
00:01:38,990 --> 00:01:40,880
and we're in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> market and we did go to</font>

37
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:42,950
a testing facility where they test it if

38
00:01:42,950 --> 00:01:45,380
rhino horn was real or fake just the

39
00:01:45,380 --> 00:01:47,810
existence of that facility self made it

40
00:01:47,810 --> 00:01:50,719
seem that this was actually a problem

41
00:01:50,719 --> 00:01:53,299
people are<font color="#E5E5E5"> trying to sell horns from</font>

42
00:01:53,299 --> 00:01:56,390
oxen and other<font color="#E5E5E5"> animals and passing it</font>

43
00:01:56,390 --> 00:01:58,670
off as rhino horn<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think that people</font>

44
00:01:58,670 --> 00:02:00,590
are even using other materials some even

45
00:02:00,590 --> 00:02:02,689
like wood that's treated to make it seem

46
00:02:02,689 --> 00:02:04,700
<font color="#CCCCCC">like that's rhino horn I think there is</font>

47
00:02:04,700 --> 00:02:06,619
<font color="#CCCCCC">a noticeable difference but because</font>

48
00:02:06,619 --> 00:02:08,568
people aren't in constant contact with

49
00:02:08,568 --> 00:02:10,639
rhinos or<font color="#E5E5E5"> probably have never seen one</font>

50
00:02:10,639 --> 00:02:12,739
in their whole life it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> hard for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> many</font>

51
00:02:12,739 --> 00:02:16,010
people in Vietnam to tell the whole

52
00:02:16,010 --> 00:02:19,430
feeling of buying rhino horn is absurd

53
00:02:19,430 --> 00:02:22,489
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> it mirrors a drug deal you know</font>

54
00:02:22,489 --> 00:02:24,079
we were in a hotel<font color="#E5E5E5"> room and someone with</font>

55
00:02:24,079 --> 00:02:26,239
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> package came in and their secrecy</font>

56
00:02:26,239 --> 00:02:28,250
around it and it just seems so crazy

57
00:02:28,250 --> 00:02:30,349
because we're trading in something<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

58
00:02:30,349 --> 00:02:33,530
is a placebo effect if they're dangerous

59
00:02:33,530 --> 00:02:35,360
i'm not sure we were told that<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

60
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:37,280
person that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we were buying rhino horn</font>

61
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:39,920
from are attempting to was from a crime

62
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:41,600
syndicate<font color="#E5E5E5"> that was known to have</font>

63
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:44,450
dealings in other illicit activities

64
00:02:44,450 --> 00:02:47,180
there is a testing facility as<font color="#CCCCCC"> i said so</font>

65
00:02:47,180 --> 00:02:48,680
there<font color="#E5E5E5"> are people who are paying</font>

66
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:51,319
<font color="#E5E5E5">attention to this issue but in vietnam</font>

67
00:02:51,319 --> 00:02:53,930
very few<font color="#CCCCCC"> people i think less than 10</font>

68
00:02:53,930 --> 00:02:55,819
people have ever been prosecuted on a

69
00:02:55,819 --> 00:02:57,590
rhino horn and very few people are<font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font>

70
00:02:57,590 --> 00:03:00,410
to jail so once it's in the country it's

71
00:03:00,410 --> 00:03:02,630
safe<font color="#E5E5E5"> to say you're</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> not gonna get in</font>

72
00:03:02,630 --> 00:03:06,709
trouble for having it<font color="#E5E5E5"> I definitely think</font>

73
00:03:06,709 --> 00:03:09,530
that legalizing rhino horn is an

74
00:03:09,530 --> 00:03:12,139
effective way<font color="#CCCCCC"> of keeping rhinos alive I</font>

75
00:03:12,139 --> 00:03:15,260
mean if our goal is to<font color="#E5E5E5"> continue</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to have</font>

76
00:03:15,260 --> 00:03:17,450
rhinos on this planet if it is made

77
00:03:17,450 --> 00:03:19,819
legal the price<font color="#CCCCCC"> may go down and also</font>

78
00:03:19,819 --> 00:03:22,190
perhaps the interest in rhino horn and

79
00:03:22,190 --> 00:03:24,019
because the illicit nature I think it

80
00:03:24,019 --> 00:03:25,790
may make it more attractive so I do

81
00:03:25,790 --> 00:03:27,889
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's a it's a temporary solution</font>

82
00:03:27,889 --> 00:03:30,230
that the real<font color="#CCCCCC"> solution is just people</font>

83
00:03:30,230 --> 00:03:32,269
realizing that there's absolutely no

84
00:03:32,269 --> 00:03:33,470
reason<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have a rhino</font>

85
00:03:33,470 --> 00:00:00,000
horn or to consume right
