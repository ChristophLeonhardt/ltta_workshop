00:00:01,898 --> 00:00:03,132
TO FoxNews.com.

2
00:00:03,132 --> 00:00:07,070
>> Tucker: WELCOME BACK.

3
00:00:07,070 --> 00:00:09,572
INSIDE THE ISSUE, SPECIAL

4
00:00:09,572 --> 00:00:10,206
EDITION OF TUCKER CARLSON

5
00:00:10,206 --> 00:00:10,807
TONIGHT.

6
00:00:10,807 --> 00:00:12,008
UNTIL RECENTLY BRETT WEINSTEIN

7
00:00:12,008 --> 00:00:13,943
WAS A BIOLOGY PROFESSOR AT

8
00:00:13,943 --> 00:00:15,979
EVERGREEN STATE COLLEGE IN

9
00:00:15,979 --> 00:00:16,312
OREGON.

10
00:00:16,312 --> 00:00:17,981
LAST YEAR THOUGH A TARGET MOM

11
00:00:17,981 --> 00:00:19,349
TARGETED HIM WHEN HE REFUSED TO

12
00:00:19,349 --> 00:00:21,184
LEAVE CAMPUS BECAUSE OF THE

13
00:00:21,184 --> 00:00:22,185
COLOR OF HIS SKIN.

14
00:00:22,185 --> 00:00:23,786
HE TOOK A PRINCIPAL POSITION AS

15
00:00:23,786 --> 00:00:25,788
A LIBERAL BY THE WAY.

16
00:00:25,788 --> 00:00:27,023
LATER HE FELT HE HAD TO RESIGN

17
00:00:27,023 --> 00:00:27,957
AND HE DID.

18
00:00:27,957 --> 00:00:29,826
HE TESTIFIED TO CONGRESS ABOUT

19
00:00:29,826 --> 00:00:31,094
FREE SPEECH ON CAMPUS AND AFTER

20
00:00:31,094 --> 00:00:36,766
HE DID THAT, HE SPOKE WITH US.

21
00:00:36,766 --> 00:00:37,467
PROFESSOR, THANKS FOR JOINING

22
00:00:37,467 --> 00:00:37,734
US.

23
00:00:37,734 --> 00:00:41,037
>> THANKS FOR HAVING ME BACK ON.

24
00:00:41,037 --> 00:00:41,838
>> Tucker: AMAZINGLY, IT'S

25
00:00:41,838 --> 00:00:44,073
BEEN A YEAR SINCE ALL OF THIS

26
00:00:44,073 --> 00:00:44,440
HAPPENED.

27
00:00:44,440 --> 00:00:46,376
WE TALK TO YOU IN THE MIDDLE OF

28
00:00:46,376 --> 00:00:47,310
IT, WHAT ARE THE LESSONS THAT

29
00:00:47,310 --> 00:00:48,678
YOU ARE TAKING FROM THE

30
00:00:48,678 --> 00:00:50,980
EXPERIENCE THAT YOU WENT THROUGH

31
00:00:50,980 --> 00:00:51,681
EXPERIENCE THAT YOU WENT THROUG

32
00:00:51,681 --> 00:00:52,548
THROUGH?

33
00:00:52,548 --> 00:00:54,417
>> IT'S HARD TO IMAGINE THAT IT

34
00:00:54,417 --> 00:00:56,552
HAS BEEN A YEAR BUT IT HAS BEEN

35
00:00:56,552 --> 00:00:58,955
ALMOST EXACTLY A YEAR, AND MUCH

36
00:00:58,955 --> 00:01:00,390
HAS CHANGED.

37
00:01:00,390 --> 00:01:01,591
ONE OF THE THINGS THAT'S MOST

38
00:01:01,591 --> 00:01:02,392
IMPORTANT IS THAT THE

39
00:01:02,392 --> 00:01:03,593
CONVERSATION IS IN A VERY

40
00:01:03,593 --> 00:01:05,394
DIFFERENT PLACE THAN IT WAS LAST

41
00:01:05,394 --> 00:01:05,661
MAY.

42
00:01:05,661 --> 00:01:08,531
WE ARE NOW ABLE TO DISCUSS

43
00:01:08,531 --> 00:01:11,367
ISSUES OF IDENTITY POLITICS, AND

44
00:01:11,367 --> 00:01:12,568
PEOPLE ARE STILL IN FLAMES ON

45
00:01:12,568 --> 00:01:14,771
BOTH SIDES OF THAT DIALOGUE.

46
00:01:14,771 --> 00:01:16,606
WE ARE ABLE TO HAVE THOSE

47
00:01:16,606 --> 00:01:17,907
DISCUSSIONS IN A WAY THAT IS

48
00:01:17,907 --> 00:01:19,776
VIRTUALLY IMPOSSIBLE LAST MAY.

49
00:01:19,776 --> 00:01:22,478
IT SEEMS TO ME THAT THERE IS

50
00:01:22,478 --> 00:01:23,379
ACTUALLY A RECOGNITION THAT THE

51
00:01:23,379 --> 00:01:26,516
COUNTRY IS IN DANGER, AND IT IS

52
00:01:26,516 --> 00:01:28,384
BEING PLACED IN DANGER BY

53
00:01:28,384 --> 00:01:29,419
IDENTITY POLITICS BOTH ON THE

54
00:01:29,419 --> 00:01:32,989
FAR RIGHT AND THE FAR LEFT.

55
00:01:32,989 --> 00:01:35,158
SO I SEE A MOVEMENT LED IN PART

56
00:01:35,158 --> 00:01:37,360
BY THE INTELLECTUAL DARK WEB AND

57
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:40,963
FIRE TOWARDS WHAT I WOULD CALL A

58
00:01:40,963 --> 00:01:42,999
PATRIOTIC CENTER, WHERE PEOPLE

59
00:01:42,999 --> 00:01:44,434
WHO DISAGREE OVER MANY ISSUES OF

60
00:01:44,434 --> 00:01:47,336
POLICY FIND THEMSELVES ALIGNED

61
00:01:47,336 --> 00:01:50,206
OVER BASIC AMERICAN PRINCIPLES.

62
00:01:50,206 --> 00:01:51,174
>> Tucker: YES.

63
00:01:51,174 --> 00:01:53,376
SO AS I RECALL, YOU ARE KIND OF

64
00:01:53,376 --> 00:01:55,578
CAUGHT UNAWARE BY THIS, YOU ARE

65
00:01:55,578 --> 00:01:56,612
ABSORBED IN YOUR ACADEMIC

66
00:01:56,612 --> 00:01:57,013
DISCIPLINE.

67
00:01:57,013 --> 00:01:59,182
YOU WERE KIND OF A TRADITIONAL

68
00:01:59,182 --> 00:02:00,716
FREE-SPEECH LIBERAL, YOU DIDN'T

69
00:02:00,716 --> 00:02:01,451
FULLY APPRECIATE WHAT HAD BEEN

70
00:02:01,451 --> 00:02:04,987
HAPPENING ON CAMPUS UNTIL YOU

71
00:02:04,987 --> 00:02:05,988
STOOD UP AND TOOK THE

72
00:02:05,988 --> 00:02:06,789
TRADITIONALLY LIBERAL POSITION

73
00:02:06,789 --> 00:02:07,623
THAT YOU SHOULDN'T ATTACK PEOPLE

74
00:02:07,623 --> 00:02:09,258
ON THE BASIS OF THEIR SKIN

75
00:02:09,258 --> 00:02:09,559
COLOR.

76
00:02:09,559 --> 00:02:13,496
AND YOU GOT COUNTED OFF CAMPUS

77
00:02:13,496 --> 00:02:15,398
AND THREATENED WITH VIOLENCE.

78
00:02:15,398 --> 00:02:17,033
HAVE YOU RECONCILED WITH

79
00:02:17,033 --> 00:02:17,900
EVERGREEN YOURSELF, HAVE YOU

80
00:02:17,900 --> 00:02:19,335
SPOKEN TO THE PRESIDENT OR HAVE

81
00:02:19,335 --> 00:02:22,805
THEY APOLOGIZE TO YOU?

82
00:02:22,805 --> 00:02:24,073
WHERE DOES THAT STAND NOW?

83
00:02:24,073 --> 00:02:27,009
>> THEY HAVE DONE QUITE THE

84
00:02:27,009 --> 00:02:28,010
OPPOSITE OF APOLOGIZING.

85
00:02:28,010 --> 00:02:30,980
THEY HAVE HIRED A P.R. TEAM THAT

86
00:02:30,980 --> 00:02:32,882
QUITE OFTEN DEMONIZES MYSELF AND

87
00:02:32,882 --> 00:02:35,952
MY WIFE IN THE OLYMPIAN WHICH IS

88
00:02:35,952 --> 00:02:37,787
THE LOCAL PAPER.

89
00:02:37,787 --> 00:02:38,821
THINGS ON CAMPUS HAVE ACTUALLY

90
00:02:38,821 --> 00:02:41,390
GROWN, AS MUCH AS IT'S HARD TO

91
00:02:41,390 --> 00:02:42,125
IMAGINE, MUCH WORSE THAN THEY

92
00:02:42,125 --> 00:02:45,595
WERE DURING THE RIOTS OF

93
00:02:45,595 --> 00:02:45,962
MAY 2017.

94
00:02:45,962 --> 00:02:47,597
SO EVERGREEN STATE COLLEGE HAS

95
00:02:47,597 --> 00:02:48,998
TAKEN A TURN TOWARDS THE

96
00:02:48,998 --> 00:02:50,533
AUTHORITARIAN THAT IS NOTHING IF

97
00:02:50,533 --> 00:02:52,602
NOT BREATHTAKING.

98
00:02:52,602 --> 00:02:54,570
PEOPLE ARE BEING FIRED FOR THEIR

99
00:02:54,570 --> 00:02:55,905
WILLINGNESS TO OFFER ANY SORT OF

100
00:02:55,905 --> 00:03:00,209
CHALLENGE TO THE ADMINISTRATION.

101
00:03:00,209 --> 00:03:01,577
THOSE WHO SUPPORT THE

102
00:03:01,577 --> 00:03:02,411
ADMINISTRATION AND ITS RECKLESS

103
00:03:02,411 --> 00:03:05,781
QUEST FOR WHAT IS FALSELY CALLED

104
00:03:05,781 --> 00:03:07,583
EQUITY ARE BEING PROMOTED, AND

105
00:03:07,583 --> 00:03:09,185
THE COLLEGE FACES A TERRIBLE

106
00:03:09,185 --> 00:03:11,254
FINANCIAL CRISIS AS A RESULT OF

107
00:03:11,254 --> 00:03:15,057
THE FACT THAT STUDENTS ARE NOT

108
00:03:15,057 --> 00:03:16,392
SHOWING UP.

109
00:03:16,392 --> 00:03:18,194
HAVING SEEN WHAT THE CAMPUS IS

110
00:03:18,194 --> 00:03:19,996
DESCENDING INTO, PEOPLE HAVE

111
00:03:19,996 --> 00:03:20,663
DECIDED TO GO ELSEWHERE TO

112
00:03:20,663 --> 00:03:22,465
COLLEGE WHICH HAS PUT THE

113
00:03:22,465 --> 00:03:25,101
COLLEGE $6 MILLION IN THE RED.

114
00:03:25,101 --> 00:03:27,270
>> Tucker: THAT IS ALSO SAD

115
00:03:27,270 --> 00:03:31,941
AND CRAZY.

116
00:03:31,941 --> 00:03:34,043
SO ALL YOU DID WAS SAY, I'M NOT

117
00:03:34,043 --> 00:03:35,511
GOING TO LEAVE BECAUSE I'M THE

118
00:03:35,511 --> 00:03:37,547
WRONG SKIN COLOR.

119
00:03:37,547 --> 00:03:39,582
I THINK THAT'S THE TRADITIONAL

120
00:03:39,582 --> 00:03:43,019
CIVIL RIGHTS POSITION, AND ON

121
00:03:43,019 --> 00:03:45,154
WHAT GROUNDS ARE THEY ATTACKING

122
00:03:45,154 --> 00:03:46,956
YOU?

123
00:03:46,956 --> 00:03:48,457
>> IRONICALLY THE CHALLENGE, THE

124
00:03:48,457 --> 00:03:51,093
ONE THAT APPEARS TO RESONATE

125
00:03:51,093 --> 00:03:54,497
WITH PEOPLE FROM THE FAR RIGHT

126
00:03:54,497 --> 00:04:08,144
AND LEFT, AND IT'S NOT IT'S NOT

127
00:04:08,144 --> 00:04:09,779
A THREAT PHONED IN FROM A MAN IN

128
00:04:09,779 --> 00:04:12,014
NEW JERSEY WHO CLAIM TO HAVE A

129
00:04:12,014 --> 00:04:15,418
GUN AND AT ANY RATE, IT WAS IN

130
00:04:15,418 --> 00:04:17,587
NEW JERSEY.

131
00:04:17,587 --> 00:04:19,188
BUT THE ARGUMENT IS EFFECTIVELY

132
00:04:19,188 --> 00:04:21,023
THAT STANDING UP AND SPEAKING

133
00:04:21,023 --> 00:04:23,392
ABOUT WHAT WAS TAKING PLACE WAS

134
00:04:23,392 --> 00:04:24,794
BREAKING RANKS IN A WAY THAT

135
00:04:24,794 --> 00:04:25,828
DAMAGE THE COLLEGE, BUT WHAT WAS

136
00:04:25,828 --> 00:04:28,764
NEVER SAID WAS THAT, YOU INVITED

137
00:04:28,764 --> 00:04:31,367
ME TO TALK TO YOU AND YOUR

138
00:04:31,367 --> 00:04:32,902
AUDIENCE AT A TIME WHEN THE REST

139
00:04:32,902 --> 00:04:35,137
OF THE PRESS WAS LOOKING THE

140
00:04:35,137 --> 00:04:37,240
OTHER WAY, AND WHAT IS HARD FOR

141
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:44,180
PEOPLE TO APPRECIATE, WHEN I WAS

142
00:04:44,180 --> 00:04:46,349
ON YOUR PROGRAM, THE PRESIDENT

143
00:04:46,349 --> 00:04:48,384
OF THE COLLEGE, GEORGE BRIDGES,

144
00:04:48,384 --> 00:04:49,085
HAD LITERALLY STOOD DOWN THE

145
00:04:49,085 --> 00:04:50,720
POLICE FORCE SO THEY WERE UNABLE

146
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:53,789
TO INTERVENE BETWEEN WRITERS AND

147
00:04:53,789 --> 00:04:54,824
MEMBERS OF THE COMMUNITY LIKE

148
00:04:54,824 --> 00:04:56,192
MYSELF.

149
00:04:56,192 --> 00:04:57,760
AND THE RIOTERS TOOK UP CARRYING

150
00:04:57,760 --> 00:05:02,398
BASEBALL BATS AND BATONS AND

151
00:05:02,398 --> 00:05:03,032
THEY CHALLENGE PEOPLE THAT

152
00:05:03,032 --> 00:05:08,004
DISAGREED WITH THEM PHYSICALLY.

153
00:05:08,004 --> 00:05:10,172
IT WAS QUITE A DANGEROUS

154
00:05:10,172 --> 00:05:15,578
SITUATION.

155
00:05:15,578 --> 00:05:17,780
I WAS APPARENTLY BEING HUNTED

156
00:05:17,780 --> 00:05:18,781
FROM CAR TO CAR BY PROTESTERS, I

157
00:05:18,781 --> 00:05:20,816
DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY HAD IN MIND

158
00:05:20,816 --> 00:05:22,218
BUT, AT A TIME THAT THAT WAS

159
00:05:22,218 --> 00:05:24,020
TAKING PLACE IN MY OWN

160
00:05:24,020 --> 00:05:25,121
NEIGHBORHOOD, GOING ON A PROGRAM

161
00:05:25,121 --> 00:05:27,056
WITH AN AUDIENCE UNDERSTOOD TO

162
00:05:27,056 --> 00:05:28,758
BE RIGHT OF CENTER WAS LIKE SOME

163
00:05:28,758 --> 00:05:31,193
KIND OF SIN.

164
00:05:31,193 --> 00:05:31,694
>> Tucker: THAT IS

165
00:05:31,694 --> 00:05:33,396
UNBELIEVABLE.

166
00:05:33,396 --> 00:00:00,000
I THOUGHT THEN AND I THINK NOW,
