1
00:00:02,360 --> 00:00:29,569
I've already lost close to 2 million
dollars but at least I'm alive

2
00:00:31,310 --> 00:00:37,260
my family had already gotten out of here
so I decided it'd be best to shelter in

3
00:00:37,260 --> 00:00:43,350
place here on the island and I was
making watermarks along my wall as the

4
00:00:43,350 --> 00:00:47,940
water rose up and I figured I was just
gonna have to write goodbye to my wife

5
00:00:47,940 --> 00:00:56,120
and kids at the top mark this is our
hurricane party specials that we had

6
00:00:56,120 --> 00:01:04,370
there's hell no Harve tropical storm
burger this is the water line right here

7
00:01:04,370 --> 00:01:11,010
take a look at this this boat floated
through and tried to go out the back

8
00:01:11,010 --> 00:01:17,460
door look at that
the amount of response from the people

9
00:01:17,460 --> 00:01:23,760
is just incredible and at first I was
totally broken without any hope at all

10
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:32,420
but now that I've seen the the actions
of people I know my hope is restored

11
00:01:32,420 --> 00:01:37,649
friend of mine took pictures of my house
and sent him to me and I was very

12
00:01:37,649 --> 00:01:43,320
optimistic I thought it's gonna be okay
it's gonna be okay and then when I saw

13
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:51,350
the picture it was sad it was so many
different emotions you go through

14
00:01:51,350 --> 00:01:55,980
this was our living room right here you
could tell they had one recliner here I

15
00:01:55,980 --> 00:02:01,470
had a green leather couch against this
wall we can't find it and then this room

16
00:02:01,470 --> 00:02:09,690
here was our spare bedroom where the
vacuum cleaner is and it's standing

17
00:02:09,690 --> 00:02:16,860
there it's standing there I I don't
think I can cry anymore I've gone

18
00:02:16,860 --> 00:02:24,600
through a lot of emotions a lot of anger
a lot of you know sadness a lot of you

19
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:29,790
know even Envy you know why did my house
after not why did it make it I'm a good

20
00:02:29,790 --> 00:02:36,960
person you know but anyway it's it's
gonna be okay here's the car that

21
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:51,959
doesn't belong to me it is this is the
kitchen see how beautiful it is of

22
00:02:51,959 --> 00:02:57,330
course it's all a mess right now but
it's a beautiful place so we would sit

23
00:02:57,330 --> 00:03:03,420
out here every day the Ducks would come
around and I feed them birdseed but

24
00:03:03,420 --> 00:03:07,520
we'll we'll be back

25
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:20,180
I just moved in last year yeah now
Harvey so many homes spared live spared

26
00:03:20,180 --> 00:03:26,840
neighbors helping neighbors community
helping the people our town is wonderful

27
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:32,569
that the city's been great

28
00:03:32,569 --> 00:03:37,219
it was probably this whole street was
flooded you know all the way almost past

29
00:03:37,219 --> 00:03:42,290
those barriers and as you can see that
car right there you know I have a ex

30
00:03:42,290 --> 00:03:45,469
coworker who lives over there on the
west side of warden she called me and

31
00:03:45,469 --> 00:03:49,159
said you know I need you to bring a boat
over here and then as time progressed I

32
00:03:49,159 --> 00:03:52,370
realized other people's houses were
going underwater and that you know I had

33
00:03:52,370 --> 00:03:55,370
to help them so I went around the
neighborhood and saw who needed help and

34
00:03:55,370 --> 00:04:00,739
one by one I started taking people out
family about family you know Wharton we

35
00:04:00,739 --> 00:04:04,549
all come together in Texas I mean as
soon as the call went out after that

36
00:04:04,549 --> 00:04:09,799
night the next night I saw 15 boats
coming to Wharton with any natural

37
00:04:09,799 --> 00:04:13,040
disaster there's gonna be anger and
sadness but at the same time there's

38
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:16,789
happiness they may have lost everything
but they still have their family and you

39
00:04:16,789 --> 00:04:19,399
know that's all that counts you can
replace a house but you can't replace a

40
00:04:19,399 --> 00:00:00,000
family
