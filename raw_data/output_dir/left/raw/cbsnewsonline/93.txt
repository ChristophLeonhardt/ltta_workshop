. 

2
00:00:02,201 --> 00:00:05,438
>>> GETTING BIG NEWS OUT OF THE 

3
00:00:05,438 --> 00:00:05,771
WHITE HOUSE. 

4
00:00:05,771 --> 00:00:08,141
THE FORMER CIA DIRECTOR HAS HAD 

5
00:00:08,141 --> 00:00:09,508
HIS CLEARANCES REVOKED. 

6
00:00:09,508 --> 00:00:11,044
WE WILL TAKE YOU THERE LIVE. 

7
00:00:11,044 --> 00:00:13,513
>>  COURTESY THAT MAY HAVE BEEN 

8
00:00:13,513 --> 00:00:13,913
DUE TO HIM. 

9
00:00:13,913 --> 00:00:19,818
HE HAS A HISTORY THAT CALLS IN 

10
00:00:19,818 --> 00:00:21,287
TO QUESTION HIS CREDITABILITY. 

11
00:00:21,287 --> 00:00:24,824
IN 2014 HE DENIED TO CONGRESS 

12
00:00:24,824 --> 00:00:25,925
THAT CIA OFFICIALS HAD 

13
00:00:25,925 --> 00:00:28,027
IMPROPERLY ACCESSED THE 

14
00:00:28,027 --> 00:00:29,362
COMPUTER FILES OF CONGRESSIONAL 

15
00:00:29,362 --> 00:00:29,629
STAFFERS. 

16
00:00:29,629 --> 00:00:31,030
HE TOLD THE COUNSEL OF FOREIGN 

17
00:00:31,030 --> 00:00:34,033
RELATION THAT THE CIA WOULDN'T 

18
00:00:34,033 --> 00:00:35,201
DO SUCH A THING. 

19
00:00:35,201 --> 00:00:38,138
THE CIA'S INSPECTOR GENERAL 

20
00:00:38,138 --> 00:00:40,073
WENT AGAINST HIM DIRECTLY, 

21
00:00:40,073 --> 00:00:44,077
SAYING THAT AGENCY OFFICIALS 

22
00:00:44,077 --> 00:00:46,179
HAD INDEED ACCESSED 

23
00:00:46,179 --> 00:00:46,779
CONGRESSIONAL STAFFER FILES. 

24
00:00:46,779 --> 00:00:47,813
MORE RECENTLY HE TOLD CONGRESS 

25
00:00:47,813 --> 00:00:49,716
THAT THE INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY 

26
00:00:49,716 --> 00:00:54,220
DIDN'T MAKE USE OF THE SO-

27
00:00:54,220 --> 00:00:57,023
CALLED STEEL DOSSI, ER ABOUT 

28
00:00:57,023 --> 00:00:57,623
THE 2016 ELECTION. 

29
00:00:57,623 --> 00:00:59,058
THE ASSERTION THAT GOES AGAINST 

30
00:00:59,058 --> 00:00:59,959
TWO OTHER OFFICIALS IN THE 

31
00:00:59,959 --> 00:01:04,864
INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY AND ALL 

32
00:01:04,864 --> 00:01:05,197
OF THE FACTS. 

33
00:01:05,197 --> 00:01:07,634
ADDITIONLY HE HAS RECENTLY 

34
00:01:07,634 --> 00:01:09,602
LEVER AGED HIS STATUS AS A 

35
00:01:09,602 --> 00:01:10,737
FORMER HIGH RANKING OFFICIAL 

36
00:01:10,737 --> 00:01:11,938
WITH ACCESS TO HIGH RANKING 

37
00:01:11,938 --> 00:01:17,043
INFORMATION TO MAKE A SERIES OF 

38
00:01:17,043 --> 00:01:17,844
UNFOUNDED ALLEGATIONS, WILD 

39
00:01:17,844 --> 00:01:20,346
OUTBURSTS ON THE TELEVISION 

40
00:01:20,346 --> 00:01:21,247
ABOUT THIS ADMINISTRATION. 

41
00:01:21,247 --> 00:01:25,051
HIS LYING AND CONDUCT SHOWED BY 

42
00:01:25,051 --> 00:01:26,252
INCREASINGLY FRENZIED COMMENTS 

43
00:01:26,252 --> 00:01:31,257
ARE NOT CONSISTENT WITH ACCESS 

44
00:01:31,257 --> 00:01:34,427
TO THE NATION'S MOST CLOSELY 

45
00:01:34,427 --> 00:01:34,794
HELD SECRETS. 

46
00:01:34,794 --> 00:01:37,997
MORE BROADLY THE ISSUE OF HIS 

47
00:01:37,997 --> 00:01:39,065
SECURITY CLEARANCE RAISES 

48
00:01:39,065 --> 00:01:40,466
LARGER QUESTIONS ABOUT THE 

49
00:01:40,466 --> 00:01:42,302
PRACTICE OF FORMER OFFICIALS 

50
00:01:42,302 --> 00:01:43,369
PLAIN TAKENNING ACCESS TO 

51
00:01:43,369 --> 00:01:44,871
SENSITIVE SECRETS LONG AFTER 

52
00:01:44,871 --> 00:01:47,173
THEIR TIME IN GOVERNMENT HAS 

53
00:01:47,173 --> 00:01:47,440
ENDED. 

54
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:48,775
SUCH ACCESS IS PARTICULARLY 

55
00:01:48,775 --> 00:01:51,644
INAPPROPRIATE WHEN FORMER 

56
00:01:51,644 --> 00:01:52,378
OFFICIALS HAVE TRANSITIONED 

57
00:01:52,378 --> 00:01:55,080
INTO HIGHLY PARTISAN POSITIONS 

58
00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:58,051
AND SEEK TO USE REAL OR 

59
00:01:58,051 --> 00:01:59,218
PERCEIVED ACCESS TO VALIDATE 

60
00:01:59,218 --> 00:02:00,119
THEIR POLITICAL ATTACKS. 

61
00:02:00,119 --> 00:02:01,654
ANY ACCESS GRANTED TO THE 

62
00:02:01,654 --> 00:02:03,356
SECRETS SHOULD BE IN 

63
00:02:03,356 --> 00:02:04,857
FURTHERANCE OF NATIONAL, NOT 

64
00:02:04,857 --> 00:02:05,290
PERSONAL INTERESTS. 

65
00:02:05,290 --> 00:02:06,559
FOR THIS REASON I HAVE ALSO 

66
00:02:06,559 --> 00:02:07,760
STARTED TO REVIEW THE MORE 

67
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:10,797
GENERAL QUESTION OF THE ACCESS 

68
00:02:10,797 --> 00:02:12,265
TO CLASSIFIED INFORMATION BY 

69
00:02:12,265 --> 00:02:12,732
GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS. 

70
00:02:12,732 --> 00:02:14,067
AS PART OF THIS REVIEW I'M 

71
00:02:14,067 --> 00:02:18,571
LOOKING AT ACTION WITH RESPECT 

72
00:02:18,571 --> 00:02:20,105

STRZOK, LISA PAGE AND BRUCE 

77
00:02:28,148 --> 00:02:28,348
ORR. 

78
00:02:28,348 --> 00:02:29,582
CLEARANCES FOR THOSE WHO STILL 

79
00:02:29,582 --> 00:02:32,452
HAVE THEM MAY BE REVOKED AND 

80
00:02:32,452 --> 00:02:33,253
THOSE WHO HAVE LOST THEIR 

81
00:02:33,253 --> 00:02:36,356
CLEARANCES MAY NOT BE ABLE TO 

82
00:02:36,356 --> 00:02:39,993
HAVE IT REINSTATED. 

83
00:02:39,993 --> 00:02:45,999
IT'S FOR THOSE REASON THAT I 

84
00:02:45,999 --> 00:02:46,932
HAVE EXERCISED MY AUTHORITY AND 

85
00:02:46,932 --> 00:02:50,170
I WILL DIRECT STAFF TO MAKE THE 

86
00:02:50,170 --> 00:02:51,304
NECESSARY ARRANGEMENTS WITH THE 

87
00:02:51,304 --> 00:02:52,272
APPROPRIATE AGENCIES TO PUT IN 

88
00:02:52,272 --> 00:02:52,739
THIS DETERMINATION. 

89
00:02:52,739 --> 00:02:55,408
WITH THAT I WILL TAKE YOUR 

90
00:02:55,408 --> 00:02:55,708
QUESTIONS.

JONATHAN. 

92
00:02:55,975 --> 00:02:57,009

IS -- IT SEEMS LIKE EVERYBODY

00:03:02,882 --> 00:03:04,784
THAT YOU MENTIONED HAS BEEN A 

97
00:03:04,784 --> 00:03:06,586
POLITICAL CRITIC OF THE 

98
00:03:06,586 --> 00:03:06,986
PRESIDENT. 

99
00:03:06,986 --> 00:03:09,389
IS HE GOING AFTER HIS OPPONENTS 

100
00:03:09,389 --> 00:03:09,689
WITH THIS? 

101
00:03:09,689 --> 00:03:10,155
>>  NO. 

102
00:03:10,155 --> 00:03:11,691
IF THERE WERE OTHERS THAT

AND REVIEW THOSE AS WELL. 

106
00:03:15,895 --> 00:03:20,199
>>  I WANT TO ASK YOU ABOUT 

107
00:03:20,199 --> 00:03:22,302
SOMETHING THAT THE PRESIDENT'S 

108
00:03:22,302 --> 00:03:23,236
ATTORNEY SAID. 

109
00:03:23,236 --> 00:03:24,470
HE SAID OF THE SPECIAL COUNSEL 

110
00:03:24,470 --> 00:03:25,905
-- THEY NEEDS TO WRITE THE DAM 

111
00:03:25,905 --> 00:03:27,273
REPORT SO WE CAN SEE IT AND 

112
00:03:27,273 --> 00:03:29,809

00:03:37,149 --> 00:03:37,416
BRICKS. 

117
00:03:37,416 --> 00:03:38,985

OF SPEECH BY PENA LIZING THEM? 

141
00:04:18,791 --> 00:04:20,526
THE PRESIDENT HAS A 

142
00:04:20,526 --> 00:04:21,226
RESPONSIBILITY TO PROTECT 

143
00:04:21,226 --> 00:04:23,730
CLASSIFIED INFORMATION AND WHO

UNDER REVIEW. 

151
00:04:36,175 --> 00:04:38,845
>>  IS THIS THE KIND OF 

152
00:04:38,845 --> 00:04:40,646
PRESIDENT WHO -- PRECEDENT WHO 

153
00:04:40,646 --> 00:04:41,647
WANTS TO SET FOR FUTURE 

154
00:04:41,647 --> 00:04:43,616
PRESIDENTS AND WHY ARE THERE NO 

155
00:04:43,616 --> 00:04:44,183
REPUBLICANS ON THAT LIST? 

156
00:04:44,183 --> 00:04:46,786
>>  ONCE AGAIN IF WE DEEMED IT 

157
00:04:46,786 --> 00:04:49,522
NECESSARY WE WOULD LOOK INTO 

158
00:04:49,522 --> 00:04:50,623

159
00:04:50,623 --> 00:04:53,926

TURKEY BUT JUST -- I GUESS -- 

161
00:04:55,895 --> 00:04:57,730
THE REASON PEOPLE WOULD SAY 

162
00:04:57,730 --> 00:04:59,065
THIS ARGUMENT IS STRAINING 

163
00:04:59,065 --> 00:05:00,933
CREDITABILITY IS THERE ARE 

164
00:05:00,933 --> 00:05:01,867
EXAMPLES EVEN FROM THIS 

165
00:05:01,867 --> 00:05:02,769
ADMINISTRATION, YOUR FORMER

ADMITTED TO LYING TO THE FBI. 

168
00:05:06,739 --> 00:05:09,242
WHY IS THIS ONLY A LIST OF 

169
00:05:09,242 --> 00:05:11,144
DEMOCRATS WHO HAVE BEEN 

170
00:05:11,144 --> 00:05:12,545
CRITICAL OF THE ADMINISTRATION 

171
00:05:12,545 --> 00:05:13,446
AND WHY SHOULD AMERICANS HAVE 

172
00:05:13,446 --> 00:05:14,847
CONFIDENCE THAT YOU ARE TAKING 

173
00:05:14,847 --> 00:05:16,449
THIS SERIOUSLY IF THERE IS NOT 

174
00:05:16,449 --> 00:05:18,551
A SINGLE REPUBLICAN ON THAT 

175
00:05:18,551 --> 00:05:18,751
LIST? 

176
00:05:18,751 --> 00:05:20,153
>>  AGAIN CERTAINLY WE WOULD 

177
00:05:20,153 --> 00:05:22,255
LOOK AT THOSE IF WE DEEMED IT 

178
00:05:22,255 --> 00:05:24,190
NECESSARILY AND WE WILL KEEP 

179
00:05:24,190 --> 00:05:26,759

AMERICAN GOODS, IS THERE A 

185
00:05:35,101 --> 00:05:37,003
RESPONSE TO THAT AND IS THERE 

186
00:05:37,003 --> 00:05:37,470
ANY DISCUSSION ABOUT 

187
00:05:37,470 --> 00:05:39,172
RETALIATION ABOUT THAT AND 

188
00:05:39,172 --> 00:05:42,275
CONTINUING TO ESCALATE THIS? 

189
00:05:42,275 --> 00:05:43,676
>>  THE TARIFFS ARE REGRETTABLE 

190
00:05:43,676 --> 00:05:45,978
AND A STEP IN THE WRONG 

191
00:05:45,978 --> 00:05:46,278
DIRECTION. 

192
00:05:46,278 --> 00:05:48,080
THE TARIFFS THE UNITED STATES 

193
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:50,383
PUT ON TURKEY WERE OUT OF 

194
00:05:50,383 --> 00:05:52,485
NATIONAL SECURITY INTERESTS. 

195
00:05:52,485 --> 00:05:53,318
THEIRS ARE OUT OF RETALIATION. 

196
00:05:53,318 --> 00:05:54,687
I'M NOT GOING TO GET AHEAD OF 

197
00:05:54,687 --> 00:05:57,089
ANYTHING ON WHAT WE MAY OR MAY 

198
00:05:57,089 --> 00:05:59,558
NOT DO IN EFFORT TO RESPOND. 

199
00:05:59,558 --> 00:06:02,462
WE -- WE DON'T SUPPORT TURKEY'S 

200
00:06:02,462 --> 00:06:03,296
DECISION TO RETALIATE AGAINST 

201
00:06:03,296 --> 00:06:04,497
US PROTECTING OUR NATIONAL 

202
00:06:04,497 --> 00:06:04,964
SECURITY INTERESTS. 

203
00:06:04,964 --> 00:06:09,067
>>  AN APPEALS COURT IN TURKEY 

204
00:06:09,067 --> 00:06:10,703
DENIED THE PASTOR'S APPEAL TO 

205
00:06:10,703 --> 00:06:11,470
TRY TO BE RELEASES. 

206
00:06:11,470 --> 00:06:12,905
DOES THE ADMINISTRATION SEE 

207
00:06:12,905 --> 00:06:18,511
THAT AS A NEW SET BACK? 

208
00:06:18,511 --> 00:06:22,081
>>  WE FEEL THAT TURKEY AND 

209
00:06:22,081 --> 00:06:23,182
SPECIFIC THE PRESIDENT OF 

210
00:06:23,182 --> 00:06:25,151
TURKEY HAVE TREATED PASTOR 

211
00:06:25,151 --> 00:06:26,886
BRUNSON WHO WE KNOW TO BE A 

212
00:06:26,886 --> 00:06:28,387
VERY GOOD PERSON AND A STRONG 

213
00:06:28,387 --> 00:06:31,089
CHRISTIAN WHO HAS DONE NOTHING 

214
00:06:31,089 --> 00:06:32,158
WRONG, VERY UNFAIRLY, VERY 

215
00:06:32,158 --> 00:06:32,391
BADLY. 

216
00:06:32,391 --> 00:06:35,595
IT'S SOMETHING THAT WE WON'T 

217
00:06:35,595 --> 00:06:38,097
FORGET IN THE ADMINISTRATION.  

218
00:06:38,097 --> 00:06:38,297
JAKE. 

219
00:06:38,297 --> 00:06:38,564
GO HEAD. 

220
00:06:38,564 --> 00:06:39,832
>>  SO, THE ADMINISTRATION HAS 

221
00:06:39,832 --> 00:06:41,734
PUT UP A DEFENSE OF PASTOR 

222
00:06:41,734 --> 00:06:43,236
BRUNSON BUT THERE ARE TENS OF 

223
00:06:43,236 --> 00:06:45,071
THOUSANDS OF CHRISTIANS IN 

224
00:06:45,071 --> 00:06:50,410
NORTH KOREA WHO HAVE BEEN IN 

225
00:06:50,410 --> 00:06:51,811
PRISON BECAUSE OF THEIR 

226
00:06:51,811 --> 00:06:52,111
RELIGION. 

227
00:06:52,111 --> 00:06:53,646
THEY ARE CONSIDERED TO BE THE 

228
00:06:53,646 --> 00:06:57,450
NUMBER ONE COUNTRY WHEN IT 

229
00:06:57,450 --> 00:06:57,917
COMES TO PERSECUTING 

230
00:06:57,917 --> 00:06:58,250
CHRISTIANSS. 

231
00:06:58,250 --> 00:06:59,018
THIS SOMETHING THE 

232
00:06:59,018 --> 00:07:01,120
ADMINISTRATION IS SHOOING INTO? 

233
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:05,825
>>  WE WOULD LIKE TO SEE ANY 

234
00:07:05,825 --> 00:07:06,425
ANYONE PERSECUTED FOR THEIR 

235
00:07:06,425 --> 00:07:06,826
BELIEFS RELEASED. 

236
00:07:06,826 --> 00:07:07,927
WE HAVE BEEN WORKING WITH NORTH 

237
00:07:07,927 --> 00:07:09,261
KOREA ON A NUMBER OF FRONTS. 

238
00:07:09,261 --> 00:07:11,431
THAT'S SOMETHING WE WOULD LIKE 

239
00:07:11,431 --> 00:07:12,798
TO SEE THEM CHANGE THEIR 

240
00:07:12,798 --> 00:07:13,065
BEHAVIOR. 

241
00:07:13,065 --> 00:07:14,367
I KNOW ITS BEEN DISCUSSED AND 

242
00:07:14,367 --> 00:07:15,000
AGAIN CERTAINLY SOMETHING WE 

243
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:18,905
WOULD LIKE TO SEE THEIR 

244
00:07:18,905 --> 00:07:19,639
BEHAVIOR CHANGE. 

245
00:07:19,639 --> 00:07:20,206
I HAVE TO KEEP. 

246
00:07:20,206 --> 00:07:20,473
GO HEAD. 

247
00:07:20,473 --> 00:07:22,308
>>  THOUGH TERRITORY HELD HAS 

248
00:07:22,308 --> 00:07:25,711
BEEN REDUCED BY OVER 90% A 

249
00:07:25,711 --> 00:07:28,247
REPORT SUGGESTS THAT AS MANY AS 

250
00:07:28,247 --> 00:07:29,481
30,000ISIS MEMBERS STILL EXIST. 

251
00:07:29,481 --> 00:07:30,516
WHAT'S THE ADMINISTRATION'S 

252
00:07:30,516 --> 00:07:32,618
TAKE ON THIS REPORT AND WHAT 

253
00:07:32,618 --> 00:07:33,886
WOULD THE ADMINISTRATION 

254
00:07:33,886 --> 00:07:35,421
INTEREST A VICTORY AGAINST 

255
00:07:35,421 --> 00:07:35,621
ISIS? 

256
00:07:35,621 --> 00:07:38,724
>>  WE WOULD LIKE TO SEE EVERY 

257
00:07:38,724 --> 00:07:40,092
SINGLE MEMBER OF ISIS DEFEATED 

258
00:07:40,092 --> 00:07:40,959
ACROSS THE GLOBE. 

259
00:07:40,959 --> 00:07:44,864
I THINK THAT WOULD BE THE 

260
00:07:44,864 --> 00:07:45,264
ULTIMATE VICTORY. 

261
00:07:45,264 --> 00:07:45,531
GO HEAD. 

262
00:07:45,531 --> 00:07:47,266
>>  THANK YOU. 

263
00:07:47,266 --> 00:07:49,568
CLOSING ARMS ARE TAKING PLACE 

264
00:07:49,568 --> 00:07:52,371
ACROSS THE RIVER FOR THE TAX 

265
00:07:52,371 --> 00:07:53,905
FRAUD TRIAL OF PAUL MANAFORT. 

266
00:07:53,905 --> 00:07:56,142
IN MID-JUNE THE PRESIDENT SAID 

267
00:07:56,142 --> 00:07:58,010
THAT HE FELT BADLY FOR MR. 

268
00:07:58,010 --> 00:08:00,746
MANAFORT AND THAT HE BELIEVES 

269
00:08:00,746 --> 00:08:02,214
HE IS BEING TREATED UNFAIRLY. 

270
00:08:02,214 --> 00:08:04,250
IS THE PRESIDENT STILL FRIENDS 

271
00:08:04,250 --> 00:08:04,617
WITH MANAFORT? 

272
00:08:04,617 --> 00:08:07,153
WHEN WAS THE LAST TIME HE SPOKE 

273
00:08:07,153 --> 00:08:07,386
TO HIM? 

274
00:08:07,386 --> 00:08:10,523
>>  I'M NOT AWARE OF ANY 

275
00:08:10,523 --> 00:08:12,558
CONVERSATIONS THAT THEY HAVE 

276
00:08:12,558 --> 00:08:12,858
HAD. 

277
00:08:12,858 --> 00:08:15,461
>>  I THINK THAT THE PRESIDENT 

278
00:08:15,461 --> 00:08:17,229
HAS MADE THAT CLEAR IN HIS 

279
00:08:17,229 --> 00:08:17,663
PREVIOUS COMMENTS. 

280
00:08:17,663 --> 00:08:18,998
I HAVE NOTHING TO ADD. 

281
00:08:18,998 --> 00:08:20,199
>>  THANK YOU. 

282
00:08:20,199 --> 00:08:24,070
YOU JUST SAID THAT -- A COUPLE 

283
00:08:24,070 --> 00:08:28,174
EVER MINUTES AGO THAT THE 

284
00:08:28,174 --> 00:08:28,975
INCREASED TARIFF LEVELS WITH 

285
00:08:28,975 --> 00:08:30,176
TURKEY WAS IN NATIONAL SECURITY 

286
00:08:30,176 --> 00:08:30,876
INTERESTS BUT WHEN THE 

287
00:08:30,876 --> 00:08:32,311
PRESIDENT ANNOUNCED IT HE SAID 

288
00:08:32,311 --> 00:08:34,280
AT THE TIME OUR RELATION WAS 

289
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:37,450
TURKEY ARE NOT GOOD AT THIS 

290
00:08:37,450 --> 00:08:37,650
TIME. 

291
00:08:37,650 --> 00:08:38,284
THE SUGGESTION BEING THAT THIS 

292
00:08:38,284 --> 00:08:41,787
HAS TO DO WITH THE PASTOR THAT 

293
00:08:41,787 --> 00:08:43,956
IS BEING HELD IN TURKEY. 

294
00:08:43,956 --> 00:08:46,392
IF PASTOR BRUNSON IS ALLOWED TO 

295
00:08:46,392 --> 00:08:51,397
LEAVE TURKEY DO THE TARIFF 

296
00:08:51,397 --> 00:08:52,798
LEVELS GO AWAY? 

297
00:08:52,798 --> 00:08:53,799
>>  NO. 

298
00:08:53,799 --> 00:08:55,835
THE TARIFFS THAT ARE IN PLACE 

299
00:08:55,835 --> 00:09:00,106
ON STEEL WOULD NOT BE REMOVED 

300
00:09:00,106 --> 00:09:01,907
WITH THE RELEASE OF PASTOR 

301
00:09:01,907 --> 00:09:02,308
BRUNSON. 

302
00:09:02,308 --> 00:09:06,712
THEY ARE SPECIFIC TO NATIONAL 

303
00:09:06,712 --> 00:09:06,978
SECURITY. 

304
00:09:06,978 --> 00:09:07,713
THE SANCTIONS ARE SPECIFIC TO 

305
00:09:07,713 --> 00:09:10,182
PASTOR BRUNSON AND OTHERS THAT 

306
00:09:10,182 --> 00:09:12,018
WE FEEL ARE BEING HELD 

307
00:09:12,018 --> 00:09:12,285
UNFAIRLY. 

308
00:09:12,285 --> 00:09:13,686
WE WOULD CONSIDER THAT AT THAT 

309
00:09:13,686 --> 00:09:14,320
POINT. 

310
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:17,390
>>  IN THE INTEREST OF NATIONAL 

311
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:18,925
SECURITY WHAT'S CHANGED OVER 

312
00:09:18,925 --> 00:09:21,060
THE LAST MONTH OR SO WITH 

313
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:21,927
TURKEY THAT YOU ARE JUSTIFYING 

314
00:09:21,927 --> 00:09:22,361
NATIONAL SECURITY? 

315
00:09:22,361 --> 00:09:24,463
>>  AGAIN THE PRESIDENT HAS 

316
00:09:24,463 --> 00:09:30,769
BEEN CLEAR ABOUT THE STEEL. 

317
00:09:30,769 --> 00:09:34,273
WE MUST HAVE THE ABILITY TO 

318
00:09:34,273 --> 00:09:34,973
REACH CERTAIN LEVELS OF 

319
00:09:34,973 --> 00:09:37,175
MANUFACTURING OF THOSE PRODUCTS 

320
00:09:37,175 --> 00:09:40,613
HERE IN THE UNITED STATES FOR 

321
00:09:40,613 --> 00:09:41,714
THE PURPOSES OF NATIONAL 

322
00:09:41,714 --> 00:09:42,014
SECURITY. 

323
00:09:42,014 --> 00:09:42,515
>>  THANK YOU. 

324
00:09:42,515 --> 00:09:45,918
I WAS GOING TO ASK ABOUT TURKEY 

325
00:09:45,918 --> 00:09:46,919
BUT BASED ON YOUR OPENING 

326
00:09:46,919 --> 00:09:49,121
STATEMENT, I HAVE TO POINT OUT 

327
00:09:49,121 --> 00:09:51,424
THAT THE ATTORNEYS FOR FORMER 

328
00:09:51,424 --> 00:09:53,926
DIRECTOR COMEY AND FORMER 

329
00:09:53,926 --> 00:09:57,930
DEPUTY DIRECTOR MCABB SAY THEIR 

330
00:09:57,930 --> 00:09:59,131
PASSES WERE AUTOMATICALLY 

331
00:09:59,131 --> 00:10:03,269
DEMAGNETIZED THE DAY THEY WERE 

332
00:10:03,269 --> 00:10:03,902
SEPARATED FROM THEIR OFFICES, 

333
00:10:03,902 --> 00:10:06,939
TWO OTHERS, MR. CLAPPER AND 

334
00:10:06,939 --> 00:10:09,642
GENERAL HAYDEN SAID THEY DON'T 

335
00:10:09,642 --> 00:10:14,146
USE THE PASS AT ALL AND ALSO 

336
00:10:14,146 --> 00:10:14,847
IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING FROM A 

337
00:10:14,847 --> 00:10:16,716
HISTORIC STANDPOINT THIS WOULD 

338
00:10:16,716 --> 00:10:19,752
BE THE FIRST TIME THE PRESIDENT 

339
00:10:19,752 --> 00:10:21,754
HIMSELF REMOVED THE PASSES FROM 

340
00:10:21,754 --> 00:10:23,522
ANYONE THAT IS NORMALLY BEEN 

341
00:10:23,522 --> 00:10:26,525
DONE BY AGENCY HEADS OR 

342
00:10:26,525 --> 00:10:27,860
IMMEDIATE SUPERIORS TO PEOPLE. 

343
00:10:27,860 --> 00:10:29,528
HAVE YOU CONSIDERED ALL OF 

344
00:10:29,528 --> 00:10:30,963
THESE THINGS IN THE PROCESS OF 

345
00:10:30,963 --> 00:10:34,400
YOU SAY YOU ARE GOING THROUGH? 

346
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:37,837
>>  THE OTHER INDIVIDUALS, 

347
00:10:37,837 --> 00:10:38,803
THOSE ARE BEING REVIEWED. 

348
00:10:38,803 --> 00:10:41,140
THAT WILL BE MADE AT A LATER 

349
00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:41,340
DATE. 

350
00:10:41,340 --> 00:10:42,942
THOSE THAT HAVE BEEN REVOKED IT 

351
00:10:42,942 --> 00:10:47,646
WOULD BE FOR THE PURPOSE OF 

352
00:10:47,646 --> 00:10:49,749
REVIEWING IF THEY SHOULD BE 

353
00:10:49,749 --> 00:10:50,750
REINSTATED OR NOT. 

354
00:10:50,750 --> 00:10:54,553
>>  YOU OUTLINED TO TWO AREAS 

355
00:10:54,553 --> 00:10:56,221
OF TESTIMONY FROM BRENNON. 

356
00:10:56,221 --> 00:10:57,656
IS THIS THE ONLY STANDARD BY 

357
00:10:57,656 --> 00:11:02,595
WHICH THIS ADMINISTRATION IS 

358
00:11:02,595 --> 00:11:03,562
SAYING HE SHOULD HAVE HIS 

359
00:11:03,562 --> 00:11:04,664
SECURITY CLEARANCE REVOKED IN. 

360
00:11:04,664 --> 00:11:07,833
>>  I LAID OUT THE REASONS IN 

361
00:11:07,833 --> 00:11:08,801
THE OPENING STATEMENT. 

362
00:11:08,801 --> 00:11:09,834
SPECIFIC TO THE DIRECTOR. 

363
00:11:09,834 --> 00:11:10,803
THE OTHERS ARE CURRENTLY UNDER 

364
00:11:10,803 --> 00:11:11,070
REVIEW. 

365
00:11:11,070 --> 00:11:12,571
I DON'T HAVE ANY SPECIFICS ON 

366
00:11:12,571 --> 00:11:15,074
THIS. 

367
00:11:15,074 --> 00:11:15,607
>>  IS THAT THE STANDARD? 

368
00:11:15,607 --> 00:11:16,208
YOU -- YOU SAY SOMETHING AND 

369
00:11:16,208 --> 00:11:17,777
HAVE TO CORRECT IT IN THE 

370
00:11:17,777 --> 00:11:18,044
FUTURE. 

371
00:11:18,044 --> 00:11:19,145
IF YOU WORK FOR THIS 

372
00:11:19,145 --> 00:11:20,079
ADMINISTRATION FOR EXAMPLE, 

373
00:11:20,079 --> 00:11:21,380
DOES THAT MEAN YOU COULD LOOSE 

374
00:11:21,380 --> 00:11:22,047
YOUR SECURITY CLEARANCE? 

375
00:11:22,047 --> 00:11:24,383
>>  THIS IS BEING LOOKED AT ON 

376
00:11:24,383 --> 00:11:27,453
A CASE BY CASE BASIS WHICH IS 

377
00:11:27,453 --> 00:11:28,220
WHY THEY ARE BEING REVIEWED. 

378
00:11:28,220 --> 00:11:30,222
>>  IS THIS ADMINISTRATION HAVE 

379
00:11:30,222 --> 00:11:31,590
ANY REASON TO BELIEVE OR 

380
00:11:31,590 --> 00:11:35,561
EVIDENCE TO SUGGEST THAT HE HAS 

381
00:11:35,561 --> 00:11:37,663
MISUSED CLASSIFIED INFORMATION 

382
00:11:37,663 --> 00:11:38,730
OR MONETIZED HIS ACCESS TO IT? 

383
00:11:38,730 --> 00:11:41,167
>>  I HAVE LAID OUT THE REASONS 

384
00:11:41,167 --> 00:11:43,502
FOR THE DECISION THAT WAS MADE 

385
00:11:43,502 --> 00:11:43,802
ON THIS. 

386
00:11:43,802 --> 00:11:45,971
I WILL CONTINUE TO REVIEW THE 

387
00:11:45,971 --> 00:11:46,338
OTHER ACTIONS. 

388
00:11:46,338 --> 00:11:46,571
ANDREW. 

389
00:11:46,571 --> 00:11:48,074
>>  THE ABSENCE OF YOU NOT 

390
00:11:48,074 --> 00:11:50,776
SAYING THOSE THINGS YOU DIDN'T 

391
00:11:50,776 --> 00:11:54,480
FIND EVIDENCE OF THAT? 

392
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:55,714
>>  I'M TELLING YOU WHAT THE 

393
00:11:55,714 --> 00:11:56,548
DECISION WAS BASED OFF ON. 

394
00:11:56,548 --> 00:11:59,685
>>  I WANT TO FOLLOW UP ABOUT A 

395
00:11:59,685 --> 00:12:00,285
QUESTION ABOUT AFGHANISTAN. 

396
00:12:00,285 --> 00:12:01,954
THERE WAS ROAD SUICIDE ATTACK 

397
00:12:01,954 --> 00:12:03,589
IN KABUL THAT KILLED 37 IN A 

398
00:12:03,589 --> 00:12:03,889
SCHOOL. 

399
00:12:03,889 --> 00:12:05,224
A MILITARY BASE IN THE NORTH 

400
00:12:05,224 --> 00:12:07,893
HAS BEEN OVER RUN BUT THE 

401
00:12:07,893 --> 00:12:08,193
TALIBAN. 

402
00:12:08,193 --> 00:12:10,996
THEY HAVE ALSO TAKEN PARTS OF 

403
00:12:10,996 --> 00:12:12,163
EASTERN CAPITOL. 

404
00:12:12,163 --> 00:12:13,465
WHY DO YOU THINK THE 

405
00:12:13,465 --> 00:12:13,966
PRESIDENT'S STRATEGY IN 

406
00:12:13,966 --> 00:12:14,633
AFGHANISTAN IS WORK SOMETHING. 

407
00:12:14,633 --> 00:12:17,068
>>  AS ALWAYS WE ARE GOING TO 

408
00:12:17,068 --> 00:12:18,838
CONTINUE TO REVIEW AND LOOK AT 

409
00:12:18,838 --> 00:12:20,106
THE BEST WAYS TO MOVE FORWARD. 

410
00:12:20,106 --> 00:12:22,675
I WILL LEAVE IT TO THE 

411
00:12:22,675 --> 00:12:26,278
DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE TO GET 

412
00:12:26,278 --> 00:12:27,680
INTO SPECIFICS ABOUT TACTICAL 

413
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:28,180
SITUATIONS. 

414
00:12:28,180 --> 00:12:29,415
WE ARE COMMITTED TO FINDING A 

415
00:12:29,415 --> 00:12:31,884
POLITICAL SITUATIN TO END THE 

416
00:12:31,884 --> 00:12:32,617
CONFLICT IN AFGHANISTAN. 

417
00:12:32,617 --> 00:12:35,287
WE ARE LOOKING AT ALL AVENUES 

418
00:12:35,287 --> 00:12:36,889
OF DIALOGUE AND CLOSE 

419
00:12:36,889 --> 00:12:37,790
COORDINATION WITH THE 

420
00:12:37,790 --> 00:12:38,290
AFGHANISTAN GOVERNMENT. 

421
00:12:38,290 --> 00:12:39,692
WE WILL CONTINUE TO DO THAT. 

422
00:12:39,692 --> 00:12:41,260
IF WE HAVE ANNOUNCEMENTS OR 

423
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:42,394
CHANGES WE WILL LET YOU KNOW. 

424
00:12:42,394 --> 00:12:45,497
>>  FOLLOW UP ON THE TURKEY 

425
00:12:45,497 --> 00:12:46,732
QUESTION IF I MAY.

00:12:46,732 --> 00:12:49,735
ARE YOU GUYS SHALL DID HAVE YOU 

427
00:12:49,735 --> 00:12:52,004
ASSESSED IF THE SITUATION IN

TURKEY AND THEIR FINANCIAL 

429
00:12:54,006 --> 00:12:57,576
SECTOR IS -- IS A RISK IN LIGHT 

430
00:12:57,576 --> 00:12:59,912
OF THE FALL OF THE LIRA. 

431
00:12:59,912 --> 00:13:01,280
IT'S FALLEN LIKE A QUARTER IN 

432
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:02,114
THE LAST FEW DAYS. 

433
00:13:02,114 --> 00:13:05,885
>>  WE ARE MONITORING THE 

434
00:13:05,885 --> 00:13:08,187
SITUATION WITH RESPECT TO THE 

435
00:13:08,187 --> 00:13:08,587
TURKISH ECONOMY. 

436
00:13:08,587 --> 00:13:09,221
THEIR ECONOMIC PROBLEMS -- 

437
00:13:09,221 --> 00:13:11,790
THOSE ARE A PART OF A LONG TERM 

438
00:13:11,790 --> 00:13:12,091
TREND. 

439
00:13:12,091 --> 00:13:13,993
SOMETHING OF ITS OWN MAKING NOT 

440
00:13:13,993 --> 00:13:16,862
THE RESULT OF ANY ACTIONS THE 

441
00:13:16,862 --> 00:13:18,330
UNITED STATES HAS TAKEN. 

442
00:13:18,330 --> 00:13:19,298
>>  THANK YOU. 

443
00:13:19,298 --> 00:13:20,633
ONE OF THE INDIVIDUALS THAT YOU 

444
00:13:20,633 --> 00:13:22,534
LISTED ON THAT LIST, THAT OF 

445
00:13:22,534 --> 00:13:24,036
CLEARANCE THAT IS UNDER REVIEW 

446
00:13:24,036 --> 00:13:24,736
IS BRUCE ORR. 

447
00:13:24,736 --> 00:13:27,106
HE IS A CURRENT EMPLOYEE OF THE 

448
00:13:27,106 --> 00:13:27,739
DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE. 

449
00:13:27,739 --> 00:13:28,908
INSTEAD OF PUTTING HIM UNDER 

450
00:13:28,908 --> 00:13:30,176
THE REVIEW IS THE PRESIDENT 

451
00:13:30,176 --> 00:13:31,443
BELIEVE HE SHOULD BE FIRED? 

452
00:13:31,443 --> 00:13:34,180
>>  I DON'T HAVE ANY 

453
00:13:34,180 --> 00:13:36,148
ANNOUNCEMENTS ON THAT FRONT. 

454
00:13:36,148 --> 00:13:39,251
>>  WHY PUT A SECURITY 

455
00:13:39,251 --> 00:13:40,119
CLEARANCE UNDER REVIEW AND NOT 

456
00:13:40,119 --> 00:13:41,720
JUST FIRE HIM? 

457
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:44,123
>>  I DON'T HAVE ANY 

458
00:13:44,123 --> 00:13:46,292

459
00:13:46,292 --> 00:13:48,427
WE ARE LOOKING IN THAT. 

460
00:13:48,427 --> 00:13:50,129
>>  THANK YOU. 

461
00:13:50,129 --> 00:13:53,332
IF PEOPLE WHO CRITICIZE THE 

462
00:13:53,332 --> 00:13:54,934
PRESIDENT ON TV OR PUBLIC 

463
00:13:54,934 --> 00:13:59,138
CRITICISMS ARE THEY AT GREATER 

464
00:13:59,138 --> 00:14:00,339
RISK OF LOSING THEIR CLEARANCE? 

465
00:14:00,339 --> 00:14:01,840
>>  THIS IS A CASE BY CASE 

466
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:04,844
BASIS AND WE WILL DO A REVIEW 

467
00:14:04,844 --> 00:14:05,811
AND MAKE THAT DETERMINATION. 

468
00:14:05,811 --> 00:14:08,948
>>  A QUESTION ABOUT THE RETURN 

469
00:14:08,948 --> 00:14:10,049
OF LAWMAKERS ON CAPITOL HILL 

470
00:14:10,049 --> 00:14:11,216
AND THEN -- NOW THAT THEY ARE 

471
00:14:11,216 --> 00:14:13,919
BACK CAN YOU SORT OF LAY OUT 

472
00:14:13,919 --> 00:14:15,587
THE WHITE HOUSE STRATEGY FOR 

473
00:14:15,587 --> 00:14:17,556
MOVING FORWARD WITH THIS 

474
00:14:17,556 --> 00:14:17,789
AGENDA. 

475
00:14:17,789 --> 00:14:18,390
WE HAVE TALKED ABOUT WALL 

476
00:14:18,390 --> 00:14:23,262
FUNDING, WE HAVE -- A LOT OF 

477
00:14:23,262 --> 00:14:25,364

478
00:14:25,364 --> 00:14:25,864
KAVANAUGH NOMINATION. 

479
00:14:25,864 --> 00:14:26,798
DACA AND OTHER ISSUES. 

480
00:14:26,798 --> 00:14:29,201
IS THERE A STRATEGY IN PLACE TO 

481
00:14:29,201 --> 00:14:30,703
BEGIN TO WORK WITH LAWMAKERS 

482
00:14:30,703 --> 00:14:32,771
NOW THAT THEY ARE BACK? 

483
00:14:32,771 --> 00:14:35,074

FRONTS WITH LAWMAKERS EVEN 

486
00:14:41,447 --> 00:14:42,481
WHILE THEY WEREN'T HERE IN 

487
00:14:42,481 --> 00:14:42,881
WASHINGTON. 

488
00:14:42,881 --> 00:14:44,850
WE ARE HAPPY THAT THE HEARING 

489
00:14:44,850 --> 00:14:46,852
DATES HAVE BEEN SET FOR JUSTICE 

490

496
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:57,196
IS THAT STILL SOMETHING THAT 

497
00:14:57,196 --> 00:14:58,063
THE PRESIDENT IS CONTINUING AND 

498
00:14:58,063 --> 00:14:59,965

THE U.S.D.A.

505
00:15:07,373 --> 00:15:08,540
IS TRYING TO PUT IN. 

506
00:15:08,540 --> 00:15:09,575
SOMEPLACES THEY HAVE IT. 

507
00:15:09,575 --> 00:15:11,777
THEY SAY HAVE YOU TO WORK AND 

508

OTHER AREAS YOU DON'T HAVE THAT 

509
00:15:13,212 --> 00:15:13,779
REQUIREMENT. 

510
00:15:13,779 --> 00:15:15,447
IS THAT SOMETHING THAT THE 

511
00:15:15,447 --> 00:15:17,582
WHITE HOUSE STILL -- SUPPORTS?

THINGS HAPPEN. 

518
00:15:26,825 --> 00:15:28,293
WE WOULD LOVE FOR CONGRESS TO 

519
00:15:28,293 --> 00:15:29,395
ACTUALLY DO ITS JOB, 

520
00:15:29,395 --> 00:15:30,763
PARTICULARLY WHEN IT COMES TO 

521
00:15:30,763 --> 00:15:31,096
IMMIGRATION. 

522
00:15:31,096 --> 00:15:31,864
WE HAVE A COMPLETELY BROKEN

AFRICAN AMERICAN. 

559
00:16:35,227 --> 00:16:38,230
>>  AND WE WOULD LOVE TO 

560
00:16:38,230 --> 00:16:38,964
DIVERSIFY OUR STAFF. 

561
00:16:38,964 --> 00:16:41,967
WE WILL CONTINUE TO MAKE THAT 

562
00:16:41,967 --> 00:16:42,768
HAPPEN. 

563
00:16:42,768 --> 00:16:44,369
>>  THANK YOU VERY MUCH. 

564
00:16:44,369 --> 00:16:46,305
ABOUT THE ELECTION LAST NIGHT. 

565
00:16:46,305 --> 00:16:52,077
WE ARE SEEING THE DEMOCRATS 

566
00:16:52,077 --> 00:16:53,345
EMBRACING A MORE DIVERSE, 

567
00:16:53,345 --> 00:16:54,880
PICKING MUSLIMS, ALSO 

568
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:55,948
CANDIDATES, TRANSGENDER 

569
00:16:55,948 --> 00:16:56,481
CANDIDATES, REJECTING THE 

570
00:16:56,481 --> 00:16:56,915
PRESIDENT'S AGENDA. 

571
00:16:56,915 --> 00:16:57,850
MY QUESTION IS WHAT DO YOU 

572
00:16:57,850 --> 00:17:02,020
THINK WILL BE THE IMPACT OF HIS 

573
00:17:02,020 --> 00:17:03,355
AGENDA AND ALSO THIS RECENT 

574
00:17:03,355 --> 00:17:04,489
CONTROVERSIES ABOUT RACE AND 

575
00:17:04,489 --> 00:17:05,457
MINORITIES ON THE ELECTION IN 

576
00:17:05,457 --> 00:17:05,723
NOVEMBER? 

577
00:17:05,723 --> 00:17:07,059
>>  AGAIN I THINK PEOPLE ARE 

578
00:17:07,059 --> 00:17:09,528
LOOKING AT THE POLICIES THAT 

579
00:17:09,528 --> 00:17:10,729
THE INDIVIDUALS ARE DOING AND 

580
00:17:10,729 --> 00:17:11,729
HOW THEY WILL AFFECT THE 

581
00:17:11,729 --> 00:17:13,464
COMMUNITIES AND WHETHER OR NOT 

582
00:17:13,464 --> 00:17:15,467
IT'S ACTUALLY GOING TO HELP 

583
00:17:15,467 --> 00:17:15,834
INDIVIDUALS. 

584
00:17:15,834 --> 00:17:16,468
PEOPLE ACROSS THIS COUNTRY. 

585
00:17:16,468 --> 00:17:17,803
THAT'S WHAT WE ARE LOOKING AT. 

586
00:17:17,803 --> 00:17:19,371
THAT'S WHAT WE ARE FOCUSES ON 

587
00:17:19,371 --> 00:17:21,339
AND WILL CONTINUE TO DO. 

588
00:17:21,339 --> 00:17:21,973
I WILL TAKE ONE LAST QUESTION. 

589
00:17:21,973 --> 00:17:24,309
>>  I WANT TO ASK YOU A COUPLE 

590
00:17:24,309 --> 00:17:26,478
OF QUESTIONS ABOUT THE 

591
00:17:26,478 --> 00:17:26,944
PRESIDENT'S COMMENTS. 

592
00:17:26,944 --> 00:17:28,113
ONE IS ON HARLEY DAVIDSON. 

593
00:17:28,113 --> 00:17:28,747
THE PRESIDENT COMMENTED EARLIER 

594
00:17:28,747 --> 00:17:31,617
IN THE WEEK THAT MANY HARLEY 

595
00:17:31,617 --> 00:17:34,052
DAVIDSON OWNERS PLAN TO BOYCOTT 

596
00:17:34,052 --> 00:17:35,387
THE COMPANY AT MANUFACTURER 

597
00:17:35,387 --> 00:17:35,754
MOVES OVERSEAS. 

598
00:17:35,754 --> 00:17:35,987
GREAT. 

599
00:17:35,987 --> 00:17:39,758
IS THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED 

600
00:17:39,758 --> 00:17:41,160
STATES ENDORSING A BOYCOTT OF 

601
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:41,894
AN ICONIC COMPANY HERE? 

602
00:17:41,894 --> 00:17:44,763
>>  THE PRESIDENT HAS MADE HIS 

603
00:17:44,763 --> 00:17:45,664
FEELINGS ON THAT CLEAR. 

604
00:17:45,664 --> 00:17:47,499
HIS FOCUS IS ON MAKING SURE 

605
00:17:47,499 --> 00:17:49,534
THAT WE GET GOOD TRADE DEALS 

606
00:17:49,534 --> 00:17:51,937
AND THAT WE KEEP BUSINESS AND 

607
00:17:51,937 --> 00:17:53,172
INDUSTRY HERE IN THE UNITED 

608
00:17:53,172 --> 00:17:53,405
STATES. 

609
00:17:53,405 --> 00:17:55,007
>>  DOES HE WANT TO SEE A 

610
00:17:55,007 --> 00:17:55,974
BOYCOTT? 

611
00:17:55,974 --> 00:17:57,109
>>  HE WOULD RATHER SEE THEM 

612
00:17:57,109 --> 00:17:58,710
PUT THEIR COMPANIES BACK IN THE 

613
00:17:58,710 --> 00:18:00,612
UNITED STATES AND BUILD THEIR 

614
00:18:00,612 --> 00:18:03,649
GREAT MACHINES HERE IN THIS 

615
00:18:03,649 --> 00:18:04,183
COUNTRY. 

616
00:18:04,183 --> 00:18:06,852
THANK YOU. 

617
00:18:06,852 --> 00:18:07,920
HAVE A GREAT DAY. 

618
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:11,122
>>  IF YOU ARE TIRED OF HEARING 

619
00:18:11,122 --> 00:18:12,824
ABOUT OMAROSS AND THOSE TAPES 

620
00:18:12,824 --> 00:18:15,094
THE WHITE HOUSE DISHED OUT A 

621
00:18:15,094 --> 00:18:16,095
NEW HEADLINE TALKING ABOUT 

622
00:18:16,095 --> 00:18:18,697
REVOKING THE SECURITY 

623
00:18:18,697 --> 00:18:21,166
CLEARANCES OF FORMER CIA 

624
00:18:21,166 --> 00:18:22,467
DIRECTOR JOHN BRENNON AND A 

625
00:18:22,467 --> 00:18:24,670
HOST OF OTHERS WHOSE CLEARANCE 

626
00:18:24,670 --> 00:18:25,904
THE WHITE HOUSE HAS NOW UNDER 

627
00:18:25,904 --> 00:18:28,107
-- UNDER INVESTIGATION LOOKING 

628
00:18:28,107 --> 00:18:28,707
INTO IF THEY SHOULD REVOKE. 

629
00:18:28,707 --> 00:18:30,576
MANY OF THEM -- IT'S HARD TO 

630
00:18:30,576 --> 00:18:31,977
IGNORE ARE PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN 

631
00:18:31,977 --> 00:18:33,445
CRITICAL OF THE PRESIDENT OF 

632
00:18:33,445 --> 00:18:33,878
THE UNITED STATES. 

633
00:18:33,878 --> 00:18:35,414
WHEN ASKED WHY THERE ARE NO 

634
00:18:35,414 --> 00:18:36,281
REPUBLICANS ON THE LIST THE 

635
00:18:36,281 --> 00:18:39,451
WHITE HOUSE SAID THIS IS A CASE 

636
00:18:39,451 --> 00:18:39,951
BY CASE BASIS. 

637
00:18:39,951 --> 00:18:41,453
THY ARE LOOKING INTO AND THEY 

638
00:18:41,453 --> 00:18:44,256
WILL UPDATE THE LIST AS IT 

639
00:18:44,256 --> 00:18:44,623
WARRANTS. 

640
00:18:44,623 --> 00:18:45,624
WHEN -- WHAT WAS THE STANDARD 

641
00:18:45,624 --> 00:18:47,659
EXACTLY THAT THE WHITE HOUSE 

642
00:18:47,659 --> 00:18:51,430
USED TO REVOKE THE FORMER CIA 

643
00:18:51,430 --> 00:18:51,930
CORRECT ARE DIRECTOR'S 

644
00:18:51,930 --> 00:18:52,230
CLEARANCE? 

645
00:18:52,230 --> 00:18:53,365
IT WAS ERRATIC CONDUCT AND 

646
00:18:53,365 --> 00:18:54,032
BEHAVIOR. 

647
00:18:54,032 --> 00:18:56,001
I WANT TO BRING IN MAJOR 

648
00:18:56,001 --> 00:18:56,234
GARRET. 

649
00:18:56,234 --> 00:18:58,937
WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF THIS? 

650
00:18:58,937 --> 00:18:59,204
>>  WELL. 

651
00:18:59,204 --> 00:19:03,242
THIS WAS SET UP A COUPLE OF  

652
00:19:03,242 --> 00:19:03,542
WEEKS AGO. 

653
00:19:03,542 --> 00:19:05,144
IT STRIKES ME AS SIGNIFICANT 

654
00:19:05,144 --> 00:19:07,613
THAT THE ONE PERSON NAMED FOR A 

655
00:19:07,613 --> 00:19:09,014
REVOKING OF SECURITY CLEARANCE 

656
00:19:09,014 --> 00:19:11,650
IS THE ONE MEMBER OF THE FORMER 

657
00:19:11,650 --> 00:19:13,051
NATIONAL SECURITY AND -- TO 

658
00:19:13,051 --> 00:19:14,953
ACCUSE THE PRESIDENT OF TREASON 

659
00:19:14,953 --> 00:19:18,590
WHICH JOHN BRENNON DID RIGHT 

660
00:19:18,590 --> 00:19:21,660
AFTER THE HELSINKI SUMMIT AND 

661
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:22,360
PRESS CONFERENCE. 

662
00:19:22,360 --> 00:19:26,765
IT'S WORTH NOTING A COUPLE OF 

663
00:19:26,765 --> 00:19:28,267
OTHERS NAMED, ANDREW MCABB, 

664
00:19:28,267 --> 00:19:31,470
JAMES COMEY HAVE ALREADY HAD 

665
00:19:31,470 --> 00:19:32,938
THEIR CLEARANCES REVOKED SO 

666
00:19:32,938 --> 00:19:36,541
IT'S A NONISSUE. 

667
00:19:36,541 --> 00:19:38,577
JAMES CLAPPER AND MICHAEL 

668
00:19:38,577 --> 00:19:40,979
HAYDEN HAVE SAID THEY DON'T 

669
00:19:40,979 --> 00:19:42,581
NEED IT, DON'T WANT IT. 

670
00:19:42,581 --> 00:19:44,850
THIS SEEMS TO BE FOCUSED ON TWO 

671
00:19:44,850 --> 00:19:45,484
PEOPLE. 

672
00:19:45,484 --> 00:19:46,485
ONE A FORMER MEMBER OF THE 

673
00:19:46,485 --> 00:19:48,186
OBAMA ADMINISTRATION AND ONE A 

674
00:19:48,186 --> 00:19:50,555
CURRENT MEMBER OF THE JUSTICE 

675
00:19:50,555 --> 00:19:52,057
DEPARTMENT BRUCE ORR WHO THE 

676
00:19:52,057 --> 00:19:56,762
PRESIDENT HAS TAKEN OUT AGAINST 

677
00:19:56,762 --> 00:19:58,463
ON TWITTER FOR HIS ALLEGED 

678
00:19:58,463 --> 00:20:00,666
INCORRECT HANDLING OF HIS 

679
00:20:00,666 --> 00:20:02,167
RESPONSIBILITIES WITH IN THE 

680
00:20:02,167 --> 00:20:03,302
JUSTICE DEPARTMENT RELATED TO 

681
00:20:03,302 --> 00:20:06,338
THE HILLARY CLINTON E-MAIL 

682
00:20:06,338 --> 00:20:06,972
INVESTIGATION AND OTHER RELATED 

683
00:20:06,972 --> 00:20:07,239
MATTERS. 

684
00:20:07,239 --> 00:20:09,508
SO, IF YOU SORT OF TAKE A LOOK 

685
00:20:09,508 --> 00:20:11,877
AT THESE NAMES, SEPARATE THE 

686
00:20:11,877 --> 00:20:14,579
WHEAT FROM THE CHAFF YOU SEE 

687
00:20:14,579 --> 00:20:17,182
AROUND IT A VERY DEFINITE 

688
00:20:17,182 --> 00:20:18,584
POLITICAL ANGLE AGAINST JOHN 

689
00:20:18,584 --> 00:20:20,919
BRENNON AND BRUCE ORR AND THEN 

690
00:20:20,919 --> 00:20:22,554
NO EXPLANATION IF SOMEBODY WHO 

691
00:20:22,554 --> 00:20:23,955
IS SERVING IN THE JUSTICE 

692
00:20:23,955 --> 00:20:26,758
DEPARTMENT IS UNDER REVIEW FOR 

693
00:20:26,758 --> 00:20:27,626
HAVING THEIR SECURITY CLEARANCE 

694
00:20:27,626 --> 00:20:29,895
REVOKED WHY AREN'T THEY UNDER A 

695
00:20:29,895 --> 00:20:31,396
SPECIAL INVESTIGATION AND OR 

696
00:20:31,396 --> 00:20:32,898
FIRED IN NO EXPLANATION FROM 

697
00:20:32,898 --> 00:20:35,334
THE WHITE HOUSE ON THAT. 

698
00:20:35,334 --> 00:20:40,272
IT SEEMS LESS FOCUSED TOWARD A 

699
00:20:40,272 --> 00:20:44,076
SECURITY MATTER AND MORE 

700
00:20:44,076 --> 00:20:45,711
REINFORCING A POLITICAL 

701
00:20:45,711 --> 00:20:46,111
ARGUMENT. 

702
00:20:46,111 --> 00:20:47,779
>>  WHAT ABOUT MICHAEL FLYNF 

703
00:20:47,779 --> 00:20:50,916
WHO ADMITTED LYING TO THE FBI. 

704
00:20:50,916 --> 00:20:53,018
WHAT ABOUT HIS CLEARANCE? 

705
00:20:53,018 --> 00:20:55,620
>>  THAT IS SOMETHING THAT IS 

706
00:20:55,620 --> 00:20:57,489
-- WAS NOT DISCUSSED HERE 

707
00:20:57,489 --> 00:20:57,722
TODAY. 

708
00:20:57,722 --> 00:20:59,457
I'M NOT SURE WHAT IT IS AS 

709
00:20:59,457 --> 00:21:04,029
SOMEONE WHO HAS ADMITTED LYING 

710
00:21:04,029 --> 00:21:04,329
TO THE FBI. 

711
00:21:04,329 --> 00:21:07,899
I'M RATHER CERTAINLY THAT IT'S 

712
00:21:07,899 --> 00:21:10,401
-- EITHER UNDER REVIEW OR A 

713
00:21:10,401 --> 00:21:11,403
NONISSUE OR REVOKED. 

714
00:21:11,403 --> 00:21:15,207
THAT IS -- SOMETHING WORTH 

715
00:21:15,207 --> 00:21:16,908
POINTING OUT THAT -- THE 

716
00:21:16,908 --> 00:21:20,078
HANDLING OF INFORMATION, ACCESS 

717
00:21:20,078 --> 00:21:23,515
TO IT AND TRUTHFULNESS HAS BEEN 

718
00:21:23,515 --> 00:21:24,816
A PROBLEM FOR THIS 

719
00:21:24,816 --> 00:21:25,183
ADMINISTRATION. 

720
00:21:25,183 --> 00:21:27,853
MICHAEL FLYNN IS WORTH NOTING 

721
00:21:27,853 --> 00:21:31,089
IN ANY CONTEXT TALKING ABOUT 

722
00:21:31,089 --> 00:21:31,656
SOMEONE MISS HANDING THEIR 

723
00:21:31,656 --> 00:21:32,124
ACCESS. 

724
00:21:32,124 --> 00:21:33,825
IT'S ALSO WORTH NOTING WHEN I 

725
00:21:33,825 --> 00:21:36,028
ASKED SARAH SAND AFTERS 

726
00:21:36,028 --> 00:21:38,497
SPECIFICALLY DO YOU HAVE ANY 

727
00:21:38,497 --> 00:21:41,733
EVIDENCE TO SUGGEST OR PROVE 

728
00:21:41,733 --> 00:21:44,903
THAT JOHN BRENNON HAS MISUSED 

729
00:21:44,903 --> 00:21:46,237
CLASSIFIED INFORMATION OR 

730
00:21:46,237 --> 00:21:47,572
MONETIZED HIS USE OF CLASSIFIED 

731
00:21:47,572 --> 00:21:50,309
INFORMATION SHE DID NOT SAY 

732
00:21:50,309 --> 00:21:50,676
THAT THERE WAS. 

733
00:21:50,676 --> 00:21:52,110
SHE DIDN'T SAY ABSOLUTELY THEY 

734
00:21:52,110 --> 00:21:55,680
COULDN'T FIND IT BUT SHE DIDN'T 

735
00:21:55,680 --> 00:21:57,649
LAY THAT AS A JUSTIFICATION FOR 

736
00:21:57,649 --> 00:21:58,249
HAVING A SECURITY CLEARANCE 

737
00:21:58,249 --> 00:21:58,516
REVOKED. 

738
00:21:58,516 --> 00:21:59,818
>>  ONE OF MY FAVORITE 

739
00:21:59,818 --> 00:22:02,988
QUESTIONS TO YOU WHEN 

740
00:22:02,988 --> 00:22:04,422
TRANSLATING TRUMP IS WHY NOW? 

741
00:22:04,422 --> 00:22:07,159
>>  WHY NOW? 

742
00:22:07,159 --> 00:22:08,392
IS THAT THE QUESTION? 

743
00:22:08,392 --> 00:22:08,727
>>  YEAH. 

744
00:22:08,727 --> 00:22:09,027
WHY NOW? 

745
00:22:09,027 --> 00:22:12,531
>>  I ALWAYS HAVE A HARD TIME 

746
00:22:12,531 --> 00:22:13,397
ANSWERING THAT QUESTION. 

747
00:22:13,397 --> 00:22:14,966
>>  FAIR ENOUGH. 

748
00:22:14,966 --> 00:22:18,603
>>  IN THE SENSE -- OF -- YOU 

749
00:22:18,603 --> 00:22:21,506
HAVE ONE ASPECT OF THIS WHICH 

750
00:22:21,506 --> 00:22:28,180
IS VERY TOUGH CRITICISM OF 

751
00:22:28,180 --> 00:22:29,614
PRESIDENT TRUMP AND LOOK. 

752
00:22:29,614 --> 00:22:31,316
JOHN DOES HAVE ANABLE GAZE, I 

753
00:22:31,316 --> 00:22:33,752
THINK EVERYBODY WOULD AGREE TO 

754
00:22:33,752 --> 00:22:35,854
PICK HIS WORDS CAREFULLY. 

755
00:22:35,854 --> 00:22:37,022
TO ACCUSE THE PRESIDENT OF 

756
00:22:37,022 --> 00:22:38,857
TREASON AFTER A PRESIDENT 

757
00:22:38,857 --> 00:22:41,860
CONFERENCE IS A HEAVY, HEAVY 

758
00:22:41,860 --> 00:22:42,227
WEIGHT CHARGE. 

759
00:22:42,227 --> 00:22:47,666
IT IS OF A DIFFERENT LEVEL OF 

760
00:22:47,666 --> 00:22:51,470
INTENSITY AND VELOCITY IF YOU 

761
00:22:51,470 --> 00:22:51,837
WILL. 

762
00:22:51,837 --> 00:22:52,504
NOBODY ELSE HAS USED THAT SORT 

763
00:22:52,504 --> 00:22:57,509
OF TERM WHO HAD A POSITION LIKE 

764
00:22:57,509 --> 00:22:57,742
HIM. 

765
00:22:57,742 --> 00:23:00,078
SO, THERE IS THIS ONGOING GRIPE 

766
00:23:00,078 --> 00:23:01,613
THE PRESIDENT HAS WITH 

767
00:23:01,613 --> 00:23:02,748
CRITICISM OF THAT KIND. 

768
00:23:02,748 --> 00:23:04,950
AS FAR AS BRUCE ORR AS I SAID A 

769
00:23:04,950 --> 00:23:06,918
MOMENT AGO HE WORKS IN THE 

770
00:23:06,918 --> 00:23:07,652
JUSTICE DEPARTMENT. 

771
00:23:07,652 --> 00:23:08,753
THE PRESIDENT HAS BEEN HIM 

772
00:23:08,753 --> 00:23:10,555
APPLY INDICATING HIM ALONG WITH 

773
00:23:10,555 --> 00:23:11,589
OTHERS HE BELIEVES HAVE MISUSED 

774
00:23:11,589 --> 00:23:13,758
THEIR ROLE OR INFLUENCE WITH IN 

775
00:23:13,758 --> 00:23:16,161
THE FBI AND SHOULD HAVE 

776
00:23:16,161 --> 00:23:17,462
SOMETHING DONE ABOUT THAT. 

777
00:23:17,462 --> 00:23:21,566
TO PLACE HIS NAME ON THIS LIST 

778
00:23:21,566 --> 00:23:23,402
OF REVIEWED SECURITY CLEARANCES 

779
00:23:23,402 --> 00:23:26,471
SEEMS TO BE LARGELY IN THE 

780
00:23:26,471 --> 00:23:28,073
ARENA OF REINFORCING THAT 

781
00:23:28,073 --> 00:23:29,540
POLITICAL ARGUMENT CARRIED OUT 

782
00:23:29,540 --> 00:23:31,176
BY THE PRESIDENT ON AT WHICH 

783
00:23:31,176 --> 00:23:32,377
TIMER NOT SOMETHING THAT YOU 

784
00:23:32,377 --> 00:23:33,478
COULD OR SHOULD HANDLE 

785
00:23:33,478 --> 00:23:34,479
ADMINISTRATION WISE IF YOU 

786
00:23:34,479 --> 00:23:36,648
BELIEVED SOMEONE IN A SENIOR 

787
00:23:36,648 --> 00:23:37,415
POSITION AT THE JUSTICE 

788
00:23:37,415 --> 00:23:39,184
DEPARTMENT SHOULD HAVE OR 

789
00:23:39,184 --> 00:23:40,252
SHOULD BE INVESTIGATE FOR 

790
00:23:40,252 --> 00:23:43,054
HAVING THEIR SECURITY CLEARANCE 

791
00:23:43,054 --> 00:23:43,321
REVOKED. 

792
00:23:43,321 --> 00:23:44,989
>>  VERY GOOD POINT. 

793
00:23:44,989 --> 00:23:45,557
MAJOR GARRET. 

794
00:23:45,557 --> 00:23:46,324
GRATEFUL YOU COULD JOIN US. 

795
00:23:46,324 --> 00:23:50,462
I WANT TO TURN NOW AND BRING IN 

796
00:23:50,462 --> 00:23:51,395
CBS NEWS SENIOR NATIONAL 

797
00:23:51,395 --> 00:23:53,498
SECURITY ANALYST FRAN TOWNSEND. 

798
00:24:01,706 --> 00:24:02,340
WHAT ARE YOU ENTITLED TO WHEN 

799
00:24:02,340 --> 00:24:03,375
YOU LEAVE THE WHITE HOUSE AND 

800
00:24:03,375 --> 00:24:05,677
WHAT ARE YOU ABLE TO GET WHEN 

801
00:24:05,677 --> 00:24:08,079
IT COMES TO TOP SECRET AND 

802
00:24:08,079 --> 00:24:08,579
SENSITIVE INFORMATION? 

803
00:24:08,579 --> 00:24:09,280
>>  SURE. 

804
00:24:09,280 --> 00:24:10,915
THANK YOU FOR ASKING. 

805
00:24:10,915 --> 00:24:13,184
WE SHOULD BE HONEST ABOUT, YOU 

806
00:24:13,184 --> 00:24:16,121
KNOW A SECURITY CLEARANCE IS A 

807
00:24:16,121 --> 00:24:16,688
PRIVILEGE, IT'S NOT A RIGHT 

808
00:24:16,688 --> 00:24:18,590
WHEN YOU ARE IN GOVERNMENT OR 

809
00:24:18,590 --> 00:24:20,391
WHEN YOU LEAVE GOVERNMENT. 

810
00:24:20,391 --> 00:24:20,925
NORMALLY FOLKS AT SENIOR 

811
00:24:20,925 --> 00:24:22,294
LEVELS, WHETHER IT'S THE WHITE 

812
00:24:22,294 --> 00:24:24,095
HOUSE OR AGENCY HEADS MAINTAIN 

813
00:24:24,095 --> 00:24:25,997
THE CLEARANCES AFTER THEY LEAVE 

814
00:24:25,997 --> 00:24:28,900
IN ORDER TO ADVISE THE WHITE 

815
00:24:28,900 --> 00:24:29,200
HOUSE. 

816
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:29,934
SOMETIMES THE CLEARANCES 

817
00:24:29,934 --> 00:24:31,636
MAINTAINED BECAUSE YOU HAVE A 

818
00:24:31,636 --> 00:24:33,772
CONSULTING CONTRACT OR YOU ARE 

819
00:24:33,772 --> 00:24:36,274
WORKING WITH A CLASSIFIED 

820
00:24:36,274 --> 00:24:36,908
CONTRACTOR IN WASHINGTON. 

821
00:24:36,908 --> 00:24:39,110
SO, DIFFERENT PEOPLE HAVE 

822
00:24:39,110 --> 00:24:39,811
DIFFERENT REASONS FOR 

823
00:24:39,811 --> 00:24:41,212
MAINTAINING THEIR CLEARANCE. 

824
00:24:41,212 --> 00:24:44,449
REGARDLESS OF YOUR REASONS FOR 

825
00:24:44,449 --> 00:24:46,818
MAINTAINING YOUR CLEARANCE YOU 

826
00:24:46,818 --> 00:24:48,520
HAVE AN OBLIGATION TO SAFE FEUD 

827
00:24:48,520 --> 00:24:49,053
CLASSIFIED INFORMATION. 

828
00:24:49,053 --> 00:24:51,056
IF THERE IS A CONCERN ABOUT 

829
00:24:51,056 --> 00:24:52,356
YOUR ABILITY TO DO THAT THERE'S 

830
00:24:52,356 --> 00:24:53,925
USUALLY A PROCESS BY WHICH IT'S 

831
00:24:53,925 --> 00:24:56,628
CONSIDERED WHETHER OR NOT TO 

832
00:24:56,628 --> 00:24:57,195
REVOKE YOUR CLEARANCE. 

833
00:24:57,195 --> 00:25:00,098
THIS -- IT DOESN'T APPEAR THAT 

834
00:25:00,098 --> 00:25:01,332
ANY OF THAT HAPPENED HERE. 

835
00:25:01,332 --> 00:25:03,168
FRANKLY IT APPEARS FROM THE 

836
00:25:03,168 --> 00:25:06,538
OUTSIDE LOOKING IN THAT THE 

837
00:25:06,538 --> 00:25:08,440
PRESIDENT IS ANGRY WITH WHAT 

838
00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:12,744
JOHN BRENNON SAID IN PUBLIC AND 

839
00:25:12,744 --> 00:25:13,144
ON TWITTER. 

840
00:25:13,144 --> 00:25:16,081
JOHN HAS MADE CAUSTIC REMARKS 

841
00:25:16,081 --> 00:25:17,616
AND CAST ASPERSIONS ON THE 

842
00:25:17,616 --> 00:25:20,151
PRESIDENT BUT HE HAS A RIGHT TO 

843
00:25:20,151 --> 00:25:21,152
HAVE AN OPINIONABLE ABOUT THE 

844
00:25:21,152 --> 00:25:22,454
PRESIDENT AND IS I'MS THE 

845
00:25:22,454 --> 00:25:23,521
PRESIDENT IS ANGRY ABOUT THAT. 

846
00:25:23,521 --> 00:25:25,857
YOU WOULD HOPE THAT HE WASN'T 

847
00:25:25,857 --> 00:25:27,959
USING THE SECURITY CLEARANCE 

848
00:25:27,959 --> 00:25:29,160
PROCESS TO PENALIZE ANYONE 

849
00:25:29,160 --> 00:25:29,961
BECAUSE HE DIDN'T LIKE THEIR 

850
00:25:29,961 --> 00:25:30,228
OPINIONS. 

851
00:25:30,228 --> 00:25:32,063
>>  I WANT TO ASK YOU ABOUT 

852
00:25:32,063 --> 00:25:34,466
THAT APPEARANCE THAT IT SEEMS 

853
00:25:34,466 --> 00:25:35,600
THAT THE PRESIDENT HAS 

854
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:36,267
PENALIZED HIS CRITICS. 

855
00:25:36,267 --> 00:25:37,902
WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF THIS 

856
00:25:37,902 --> 00:25:40,672
ANNOUNCEMENT BY THE WHITE 

857
00:25:40,672 --> 00:25:40,905
HOUSE? 

858
00:25:40,905 --> 00:25:41,172
>>  LOOK. 

859
00:25:41,172 --> 00:25:42,907
I THINK THAT THE PRESS 

860
00:25:42,907 --> 00:25:44,542
SECRETARY SAID SOMETHING TO THE 

861
00:25:44,542 --> 00:25:46,444
EFFECT THAT HIS COMMENTS WERE 

862
00:25:46,444 --> 00:25:48,246
CAUSING CHAOS WITH IN THE 

863
00:25:48,246 --> 00:25:48,613
ADMINISTRATION. 

864
00:25:48,613 --> 00:25:49,681
THAT'S UNFORTUNATE BUT THAT'S 

865
00:25:49,681 --> 00:25:56,187
NOT AIR VIOLATION OF HIS OATH 

866
00:25:56,187 --> 00:25:57,521
IN TERMS OF KEEPING SECRETS. 

867
00:25:57,521 --> 00:25:58,756
IT'S JUST -- IT'S DISTURBING. 

868
00:25:58,756 --> 00:26:02,160
I THINK THEY WILL HAVE TO 

869
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:04,396
EXPLAIN HOW DID THEY DECIDE 

870
00:26:04,396 --> 00:26:06,498
WHAT HE IS DOING VERSES GENERAL 

871
00:26:06,498 --> 00:26:12,871
MIKE HAYDEN WHO IS ALSO A PRIOR 

872
00:26:12,871 --> 00:26:13,571
DIRECTOR OF THE CIA? 

873
00:26:13,571 --> 00:26:15,373
IT'S -- WHY HIM VERSES NOT 

874
00:26:15,373 --> 00:26:15,606
OTHERS. 

875
00:26:15,606 --> 00:26:17,208
WHAT WAS THE REASON AND IF 

876
00:26:17,208 --> 00:26:20,078
THERE WAS ANY FORMAL REVIEW 

877
00:26:20,078 --> 00:26:22,714
PROCESS BEFORE REVOKING HIS 

878
00:26:22,714 --> 00:26:23,014
CLEARANCE. 

879
00:26:23,014 --> 00:26:26,618
>>  THE WHITE HOUSE SAID IT WAS 

880
00:26:26,618 --> 00:26:27,986
ERRATIC CONDUCT AND BEHAVIOR 

881
00:26:27,986 --> 00:26:29,521
THAT LED HIM TO THIS 

882
00:26:29,521 --> 00:26:29,821
ASSESSMENT. 

883
00:26:29,821 --> 00:26:32,290
THE FACT THIS REALLY -- I JUST 

884
00:26:32,290 --> 00:26:35,493
DON'T REMEMBER FROM BUSH, 

885
00:26:35,493 --> 00:26:36,126
CLINTON TO THIS ADMINISTRATION, 

886
00:26:36,126 --> 00:26:38,630
OBAMA, EVER -- THIS IS SUCH A 

887
00:26:38,630 --> 00:26:40,599
MOMENT IN NATIONAL SECURITY AND 

888
00:26:40,599 --> 00:26:41,099
INTELLIGENCE GATHERING. 

889
00:26:41,099 --> 00:26:43,234
IS THERE ANY WAY FOR THE 

890
00:26:43,234 --> 00:26:44,469
INTELLIGENCE AND FORMER 

891
00:26:44,469 --> 00:26:45,170
INTELLIGENCE OFFICIALS LIKE 

892
00:26:45,170 --> 00:26:46,738
YOURSELF WHO SERVED IN PREVIOUS 

893
00:26:46,738 --> 00:26:49,240
ADMINISTRATIONS TO PUSH BACK? 

894
00:26:49,240 --> 00:26:51,309
IS THERE ANY PUSH BACK? 

895
00:26:51,309 --> 00:26:53,511
>>  I DON'T THINK IT'S -- I 

896
00:26:53,511 --> 00:26:54,713
DON'T KNOW THAT IT'S EVER 

897
00:26:54,713 --> 00:26:55,113
HAPPENED BEFORE. 

898
00:26:55,113 --> 00:26:56,081
I THINK PEOPLE ARE GOING TO 

899
00:26:56,081 --> 00:26:58,917
HAVE TO THINK LONG AND HARD 

900
00:26:58,917 --> 00:27:02,153
ABOUT IS THERE A WAY TO HAVE A 

901
00:27:02,153 --> 00:27:03,221
PUBLIC CONVERSATION ABOUT THIS? 

902
00:27:03,221 --> 00:27:04,856
YOU KNOW ONE I THINK IT'S TO 

903
00:27:04,856 --> 00:27:07,125
THE COUNTRY'S BENEFIT TO HAVE 

904
00:27:07,125 --> 00:27:08,359
JOHN AND OTHERS HAVE THEIR 

905
00:27:08,359 --> 00:27:09,661
CLEARANCES AND BE AVAILABLE TO 

906
00:27:09,661 --> 00:27:12,130
THE ADMINISTRATION EVEN IF THEY 

907
00:27:12,130 --> 00:27:13,264
DECIDE NOT TO CONSULT WITH 

908
00:27:13,264 --> 00:27:13,665
FOLKS. 

909
00:27:13,665 --> 00:27:16,034
THERE IS A LOT OF DATE TO DAY 

910
00:27:16,034 --> 00:27:17,102
ISSUES ON WHICH SOMEONE WITH 

911
00:27:17,102 --> 00:27:17,535
JOHN'S EXPERIENCE. 

912
00:27:17,535 --> 00:27:20,171
LET'S REMEMBER BEFORE HE WAS A 

913
00:27:20,171 --> 00:27:21,439
POLITICAL APPOINTEE IN THE 

914
00:27:21,439 --> 00:27:25,076
OBAMA ADMINISTRATION JOHN WAS A 

915
00:27:25,076 --> 00:27:25,676
CAREER INTELLIGENCE OFFICER. 

916
00:27:25,676 --> 00:27:26,644
HE HAS DECADES OF EXPERIENCE 

917
00:27:26,644 --> 00:27:28,446
THAT MAY BE USEFUL NOT JUST TO 

918
00:27:28,446 --> 00:27:30,949
THE HEADS OF AGENCIES BUT TO 

919
00:27:30,949 --> 00:27:31,950
HIS FORMER COLLEAGUES. 

920
00:27:31,950 --> 00:27:35,120
>>  IT'S TRUE AND AS YOU SAID 

921
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:36,588
SO MANY FORMER PEOPLE CONTINUE 

922
00:27:36,588 --> 00:27:38,056
TO MAINTAIN RELATIONSHIPS WITH 

923
00:27:38,056 --> 00:27:38,990
OTHER TOP LEVEL INTELLIGENCE 

924
00:27:38,990 --> 00:27:40,058
SECRET PEOPLE IN OTHER 

925
00:27:40,058 --> 00:27:43,695
COUNTRIES AND WHAT DOES THIS 

926
00:27:43,695 --> 00:27:44,562
SAY TO THE CREDITABILITY AND 

927
00:27:44,562 --> 00:27:45,563

COUNTRIES FOR SO LONG? 

930
00:27:47,899 --> 00:27:49,901
WHERE DO YOU SEE THIS HEADED AT 

931
00:27:49,901 --> 00:27:50,235
THIS POINT? 

932
00:27:50,235 --> 00:27:52,269
>>  THIS IS JUDGE I SAY. 

933
00:27:52,269 --> 00:27:55,173
I THINK BOTH TO OUR FOREIGN 

934
00:27:55,173 --> 00:27:57,175
ALLIES WHO WATCH THIS FROM AFAR 

935
00:27:57,175 --> 00:27:58,977
AND WONDER WHAT THIS MEANS AS 

936
00:27:58,977 --> 00:28:00,779
WELL AS THE NATIONAL -- FORMER 

937
00:28:00,779 --> 00:28:02,247
NATIONAL SECURITY OFFICIALS 

938

HERE IN THE UNITED STATES. 

939
00:28:02,814 --> 00:28:05,884
ITS BOUND TO HAVE A CHILLING 

940
00:28:05,884 --> 00:28:06,117
EFFECT. 

941
00:28:06,117 --> 00:28:07,285
REGARDLESS OF WHAT OF THE 

942
00:28:07,285 --> 00:28:08,920
REASONS THE WHITE HOUSE STATES 

943
00:28:08,920 --> 00:28:09,687
FOR REVOKING HIS CLEARANCE. 

944
00:28:09,687 --> 00:28:12,290
EVERYBODY OUT THERE WHO IS A 

945
00:28:12,290 --> 00:28:14,292
FORMER OFFICIAL WITH THE 

946
00:28:14,292 --> 00:28:14,859
SECURITY CLEARANCE, MYSELF 

947
00:28:14,859 --> 00:28:16,094
INCLUDED HAS TO WONDER WHETHER 

948
00:28:16,094 --> 00:28:18,329
OR NOT IF YOU SAY SOMETHING 

949
00:28:18,329 --> 00:28:19,697
CRITICAL YOU WILL BE THE TARGET 

950
00:28:19,697 --> 00:28:20,798
OF SUSPICIOUS BY THE WHITE 

951
00:28:20,798 --> 00:28:24,636
HOUSE AND HAVE YOUR -- PUT YOUR 

952
00:28:24,636 --> 00:28:25,103
CLEARANCE AT RISKER. 

953
00:28:25,103 --> 00:28:27,906
SO, I DO -- IT'S -- IT'S SORT 

954
00:28:27,906 --> 00:28:28,273
OF DISTURBING. 

955
00:28:28,273 --> 00:28:32,110
WHEN YOU GET A SECURITY 

956
00:28:32,110 --> 00:28:35,313
CLEARANCE YOU VOLUNTEER TO GIVE 

957
00:28:35,313 --> 00:28:36,514
UP THINGS. 

958
00:28:36,514 --> 00:28:37,114
I CAN'T DISCLOSE CLASSIFIED 

959
00:28:37,114 --> 00:28:37,448
INFORMATION. 

960
00:28:37,448 --> 00:28:38,650
I VOLUNTEER -- I VOLUNTARILY 

961
00:28:38,650 --> 00:28:41,486
DID THAT FOR THE PRIVILEGE OF 

962
00:28:41,486 --> 00:28:41,953
HAVING MY CLEARANCE. 

963
00:28:41,953 --> 00:28:43,188
THAT DOESN'T MEAN I'M NOT 

964
00:28:43,188 --> 00:28:46,391
ENTITLED TO HAVE AN OPINION 

965
00:28:46,391 --> 00:28:48,426
ABOUT POLICY ISSUES AND AS YOU 

966
00:28:48,426 --> 00:28:52,230
KNOW I'M OFTEN ON GIVING 

967
00:28:52,230 --> 00:28:52,730
OPINIONS ABOUT THINGS. 

968
00:28:52,730 --> 00:28:55,300
IT'S SORT OF WHERE -- IN A 

969
00:28:55,300 --> 00:28:57,535
COUNTRY WHERE WE PRIZE OUR 

970
00:28:57,535 --> 00:28:58,903
FIRST AMENDMENT RIGHT AND WE 

971
00:28:58,903 --> 00:29:01,206
STRIKE A BALANCE IN TERMS OF 

972
00:29:01,206 --> 00:29:02,540
OUR SECURITY CLEARANCE I DO 

973
00:29:02,540 --> 00:29:05,009
THINK THAT PEOPLE WILL FIND 

974
00:29:05,009 --> 00:29:09,314
THIS SORT OF PUNITIVE ACTION TO 

975
00:29:09,314 --> 00:29:09,681
BE DISTURBING. 

976
00:29:09,681 --> 00:29:11,115
>>  AND HIGHLY UNUSUAL. 

977
00:29:11,115 --> 00:29:14,385
THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR JOINING 

978
00:29:14,385 --> 00:29:15,019
US. 

979
00:29:15,019 --> 00:29:16,654
>>> THE JURY IN THE PAUL 

980
00:29:16,654 --> 00:29:18,723
MANAFORT TRIAL WILL SOON START 

981
00:29:18,723 --> 00:29:19,223
TO DELIBERATE. 

982
00:29:19,223 --> 00:29:19,823
THE PROSECUTION HAS FINISHED 

983
00:29:19,823 --> 00:29:22,160
IT'S CLOSING ARGUMENTS AND THE 

984
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:24,862
DEFENSE IS SET TO FINISH THEIRS 

985
00:29:24,862 --> 00:29:25,096
TODAY. 

986
00:29:25,096 --> 00:29:25,797
THE PRESIDENT'S FORMER CAMPAIGN 

987
00:29:25,797 --> 00:29:30,969
CHAIRMAN COULD FACE HUNDREDS OF 

988
00:29:30,969 --> 00:29:32,070
YEARS IN PRISON IF CONVICTED. 

989
00:29:32,070 --> 00:29:36,641
I WANT TO TURN NOW TO PAULA 

990
00:29:36,641 --> 00:29:36,841
REID. 

991
00:29:36,841 --> 00:29:38,042
SHE IS OUTSIDE THE COURTHOUSE. 

992
00:29:38,042 --> 00:29:41,713
HOW DID THE DEFENSE HANDLE THE 

993
00:29:41,713 --> 00:29:42,246
CLOSING ARGUMENTS TODAY? 

994
00:29:42,246 --> 00:29:43,047
>>  IT'S INTERESTING. 

995
00:29:43,047 --> 00:29:43,948
THE DEFENSE HAS TWO THEMES. 

996
00:29:43,948 --> 00:29:45,049
THE FIRST IS THAT THE 

997
00:29:45,049 --> 00:29:46,651
GOVERNMENT HAS FAILED TO MEET 

998
00:29:46,651 --> 00:29:47,551
THEIR BURDEN OF PROOF. 

999
00:29:47,551 --> 00:29:48,853
THEY REMINDED THE JURY THAT THE 

1000
00:29:48,853 --> 00:29:49,554
GOVERNMENT HAS TO PROVE ITS 

1001
00:29:49,554 --> 00:29:51,122
CASE BEYOND A REASONABLE DOUBT 

1002
00:29:51,122 --> 00:29:52,924
AND THEY SAID THAT THE 

1003
00:29:52,924 --> 00:29:53,591
GOVERNMENT HASN'T DONE THAT. 

1004
00:29:53,591 --> 00:29:54,826
THAT'S THE SAME THING THEY SAID 

1005
00:29:54,826 --> 00:29:55,727
YESTERDAY WHEN THEY DECIDED NOT 

1006
00:29:55,727 --> 00:29:58,830
TO PUT ON A DEFENSE OR CALL 

1007
00:29:58,830 --> 00:29:59,330
THEIR OWN WITNESSES. 

1008
00:29:59,330 --> 00:30:00,231
ONE OF MANAFORT'S ATTORNEYS 

1009
00:30:00,231 --> 00:30:02,133
CAME OUT AND MADE A STATEMENT 

1010
00:30:02,133 --> 00:30:04,168
