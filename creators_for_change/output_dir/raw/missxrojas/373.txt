00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,040
hey<font color="#CCCCCC"> Piz micronus baby directional</font>

2
00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:04,350
because it's really<font color="#E5E5E5"> noisy today where I</font>

3
00:00:04,350 --> 00:00:07,620
am I'm I said like a part of being the

4
00:00:07,620 --> 00:00:09,929
area that my secondary school was which

5
00:00:09,929 --> 00:00:12,389
<font color="#CCCCCC">is really fun but nostalgic and most of</font>

6
00:00:12,389 --> 00:00:14,700
my friends as to a university finishing

7
00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:16,020
everything awful still got<font color="#E5E5E5"> another year</font>

8
00:00:16,020 --> 00:00:17,910
to go so kind of just<font color="#CCCCCC"> like wandering</font>

9
00:00:17,910 --> 00:00:20,490
around by myself just<font color="#E5E5E5"> very very weird</font>

10
00:00:20,490 --> 00:00:22,320
apologies<font color="#CCCCCC"> for not making video yesterday</font>

11
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:25,320
the water was exactly at<font color="#CCCCCC"> my head today i</font>

12
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:26,849
wanted to talk a little bit about

13
00:00:26,849 --> 00:00:28,890
lethargy feeling of being<font color="#E5E5E5"> really like oh</font>

14
00:00:28,890 --> 00:00:31,289
oh<font color="#CCCCCC"> i don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> want to do anything today I'd</font>

15
00:00:31,289 --> 00:00:33,450
rather just stay in bed in my pajamas

16
00:00:33,450 --> 00:00:35,579
cover myself in that duvet and listen to

17
00:00:35,579 --> 00:00:37,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">that song it's called a lazy song</font>

18
00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:38,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">refreshed tumblr and then give a couple</font>

19
00:00:38,550 --> 00:00:39,989
<font color="#E5E5E5">of creative things give up about a</font>

20
00:00:39,989 --> 00:00:41,280
quarter of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the way through and that is a</font>

21
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:43,500
bad bad feeling I<font color="#E5E5E5"> always try to attack</font>

22
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:45,450
when it rears its ugly head I looked up

23
00:00:45,450 --> 00:00:47,039
the etymology of the word lethargic

24
00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:48,629
because that's what<font color="#CCCCCC"> I do and found</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

25
00:00:48,629 --> 00:00:50,100
originates from a combination<font color="#CCCCCC"> of leather</font>

26
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:52,050
which is the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Greek forgetfulness and the</font>

27
00:00:52,050 --> 00:00:53,399
word our growth which is finally enough

28
00:00:53,399 --> 00:00:55,260
a chain here in the UK which means idol

29
00:00:55,260 --> 00:00:56,879
so of<font color="#E5E5E5"> course the use of words changes</font>

30
00:00:56,879 --> 00:00:58,050
over time I do you think not

31
00:00:58,050 --> 00:00:59,730
forgetfulness has a keen role to play in

32
00:00:59,730 --> 00:01:01,320
lethargy it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not until you get up and</font>

33
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:02,640
<font color="#CCCCCC">start moving and doing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> something that</font>

34
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:04,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">you remember why you enjoy getting up</font>

35
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:06,630
and moving and doing things definitely

36
00:01:06,630 --> 00:01:08,670
the case of me so next time I use word

37
00:01:08,670 --> 00:01:09,990
lethargic I think it<font color="#CCCCCC"> will</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of be</font>

38
00:01:09,990 --> 00:01:12,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">like a remember for me it won't tell me</font>

39
00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:13,650
exactly what I've forgotten but it will

40
00:01:13,650 --> 00:01:15,060
remind me<font color="#CCCCCC"> that there is something</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that I</font>

41
00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:16,530
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> forgotten not of course if there's</font>

42
00:01:16,530 --> 00:01:17,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">anything wrong with taking a couple of</font>

43
00:01:17,850 --> 00:01:19,049
days off especially when you've been

44
00:01:19,049 --> 00:01:20,790
working really hard but it's taking days

45
00:01:20,790 --> 00:01:22,020
off in the name of lethargy that's

46
00:01:22,020 --> 00:01:23,729
perhaps not the best thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> in the world</font>

47
00:01:23,729 --> 00:01:25,920
so from here on<font color="#E5E5E5"> out I pledge to fight it</font>

48
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:27,630
like the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Gryffindor I am there's a lot</font>

49
00:01:27,630 --> 00:01:29,040
<font color="#CCCCCC">of harry potter references in today's</font>

50
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:30,900
video continuing<font color="#E5E5E5"> the trend of this month</font>

51
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:32,970
being all<font color="#E5E5E5"> about self realization that</font>

52
00:01:32,970 --> 00:01:34,229
sort of thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> i always thought you</font>

53
00:01:34,229 --> 00:01:36,630
either<font color="#E5E5E5"> a creative person or a sporty</font>

54
00:01:36,630 --> 00:01:38,640
person or I<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't even know a</font>

55
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:40,530
mathematical person I suppose because

56
00:01:40,530 --> 00:01:42,090
the way schools designed their kind of

57
00:01:42,090 --> 00:01:43,829
how you learn to categorize yourself and

58
00:01:43,829 --> 00:01:45,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's a trend that swallowed through in</font>

59
00:01:45,030 --> 00:01:46,229
the books<font color="#E5E5E5"> you read and films you watch</font>

60
00:01:46,229 --> 00:01:48,030
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> everything like that for me being</font>

61
00:01:48,030 --> 00:01:49,740
created in exercising have really come

62
00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:51,540
to rely on<font color="#E5E5E5"> one another just the exercise</font>

63
00:01:51,540 --> 00:01:53,070
i did this morning<font color="#CCCCCC"> i have so many ideas</font>

64
00:01:53,070 --> 00:01:54,540
running through my brain and I'm so much

65
00:01:54,540 --> 00:01:56,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">more willing to be creative and to put</font>

66
00:01:56,250 --> 00:01:57,869
in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> time into my work I'm starting to</font>

67
00:01:57,869 --> 00:01:59,820
think of creativity in exercising like

68
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:01,409
that movement between up and<font color="#E5E5E5"> down</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> on a</font>

69
00:02:01,409 --> 00:02:03,060
seesaw there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> always times when one's</font>

70
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:04,710
higher and one<font color="#E5E5E5"> to lower but it's always</font>

71
00:02:04,710 --> 00:02:07,759
a new furnace never in stasis ow

72
00:02:07,759 --> 00:02:10,199
crouching is hard I mean that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not to</font>

73
00:02:10,199 --> 00:02:11,880
say that there's no virtue in the

74
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:13,290
still but I've come to think of being

75
00:02:13,290 --> 00:02:14,880
still the different kind of movement a

76
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:16,710
sort of isolated movement that allows

77
00:02:16,710 --> 00:02:18,510
you to notice the extent of movement

78
00:02:18,510 --> 00:02:20,190
going on around you always movement

79
00:02:20,190 --> 00:02:22,740
always energy never lethargy not<font color="#E5E5E5"> anymore</font>

80
00:02:22,740 --> 00:02:24,780
although I have to say I did just<font color="#E5E5E5"> find</font>

81
00:02:24,780 --> 00:02:26,940
this at the charity shop do you feel

82
00:02:26,940 --> 00:02:28,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">like when</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you go home you become more</font>

83
00:02:28,290 --> 00:02:30,030
static I definitely become more of a

84
00:02:30,030 --> 00:02:32,160
child we also have<font color="#CCCCCC"> a TV</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> licence at home</font>

85
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:34,050
so I actually watch TV I drink more cups

86
00:02:34,050 --> 00:02:35,490
of tea even though I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's a</font>

87
00:02:35,490 --> 00:02:36,690
difference<font color="#CCCCCC"> between the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> way I had to</font>

88
00:02:36,690 --> 00:02:38,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">university the way I act at home I don't</font>

89
00:02:38,580 --> 00:02:39,870
think either of those is more real or

90
00:02:39,870 --> 00:02:41,730
less real but I meant you to<font color="#E5E5E5"> know what</font>

91
00:02:41,730 --> 00:02:43,440
you guys<font color="#E5E5E5"> think where you think you kind</font>

92
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:44,690
of put an actual at one of those places

93
00:02:44,690 --> 00:02:47,010
whether we are always putting out some

94
00:02:47,010 --> 00:02:48,990
<font color="#CCCCCC">whether we all are just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> actors holding a</font>

95
00:02:48,990 --> 00:02:50,670
mirror up to nature I'm gonna go run

96
00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:51,930
