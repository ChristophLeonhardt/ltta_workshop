now we turn to some new disclosures that offer a window into how closely the Trump world coordinates its potential attacks on law enforcement now while this is somewhat relevant to the Malheur probe the story actually focuses on the recently ousted Democratic Attorney General of New York who had battled with Trump but was separately exposed for allegations of horrific repeated domestic abuse and just about everyone agrees that man Eric Schneiderman should be out of office and held accountable for those accusations against him some are asking how it took so long for that particularly story to break though The New Yorker detailed that Shai durman's own threats against these women accusers clearly account for part of the delay now the Los Angeles Times is reporting none other than yes Trump lawyer Michael Cohen was allegedly told about some of these very accusations and that's not because Cohen was seen as an advocate for potentially abused women it is because allegedly this was the kind of information that Trump's team might have been able to use against Eric Schneiderman who had accused Trump of defrauding thousands of people in 2013 through Trump University a claim that Trump would ultimately settle by paying many of those people back but Trump did not just deny wrongdoing he attacked Schneiderman saying is he a crook wait and see and then very interestingly saying he was quote worse than Spitzer or Weiner who of course had their own public scandals of a certain similar nature now that could have been hyperbole at the time or did Donald Trump know something then those are of course the questions the new report raises and there's more the man who Roger stone says was his back channel to WikiLeaks Randi credito is now saying tonight that he was asked specifically by Roger stone to promote a separate but explosive accusation against the same Trump fo Eric Schneiderman there was a gossip item back in 2014 source to credit Co that accused Schneiderman of snorting coke in the back of a bar credit Co saying quote I saw him Sneiderman put it up his nose a white powder in the back room of a bar while he was state senator now this long-forgotten piece of gossip does look different tonight and especially when you add this which we found at the time of course he was just a reality store but reality star but Donald Trump basically called in to Fox & Friends the same morning of that gossip item and plucked out of the air that same claim by saying they some people are now saying Schneiderman took coke police sued me and I could have sued they wanted to settle so bad I could have settled so easily and instead I'm winning the case like easily tonight amidst a total lightweight a real dope and yeah now they're saying he took coke and you know as far as I'm concerned he probably still does now they're saying it took coke no spider-man denied that account but based on the newly released allegations Schneiderman's credibility itself is in doubt I want to note that but the other thing that's coming up here is these same people the Trump defenders claim are just random former advisors people like stone and credit go who Trump defenders dismiss by saying look they go rogue or they're just seeking attention they now appear involved in this very high priority clash with the top prosecutor in New York who was suing Trump and they were hitting the exact message that Trump wanted at the same time while he called in TV to push it so was that a coincidental synchronization or something more formal more collusion II we're not just exploring a theory here this is also based on reporting and I have a new response from both credit go and ston credit go telling MSNBC that stone emailed him at the time urging him to continue those very attacks on Schneiderman credit go says that he resisted going further and that indeed he had wanted his original accusation to be off the record so we also asked Roger stone about that and tonight he sent in this reply Randi credit Co told me he snorted cocaine with Eric Schneiderman in the back room of a Manhattan comedy club I urged him to go public with this during the election for attorney general now that's interesting because it's more of a confirmation than a denial it does put responsibility back on credit Co which makes sense credit go was the original source but put aside all those weird details in the larger revelation is that some attacks on law enforcement which benefit Donald Trump could be far more coordinated than disclosed at the time and one of the central questions in the Malheur probe is whether people who may appear quote distant people like Michael Cohen or Roger stone were they going rogue were they acting on their own behalf or were they making moves explicitly on behalf of Donald Trump and we don't have all the answers tonight especially when it comes to the complex history with Eric Schneiderman or who was paying into those Michael Cohen slush funds and why but we do know Bob Muller is investigating all this and only Donald Trump knows how much real evidence on this is really out there hey there arm Chris Hayes from MSNBC thanks for watching MSNBC on
