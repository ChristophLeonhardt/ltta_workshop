you along with with comscore and others are widely known for your measurement offerings last summer you launched your media program what is that qualcast you're right did start as a measurement company and measurement was really the foundation to get to where we ultimately have the vision to take the company which is to really connect buyers and sellers of media in a way that is defined around audiences and people really ask a lot of times what does that really mean well what it means is if you think about search search is all about audiences it's people typing in keywords and people building out audiences based on the keywords that those consumers are are essentially typing into the box in display you don't have that and so what we've done is we've developed a way for advertisers to define their own audiences by placing a pixel on their website capturing what's unique about that person and then finding more people like them across the web and the media program essentially joins the two sides the market and advertiser builds an audience segments and a publisher can then sell that exact audience segments to them what it does is it reduces friction it gives the advertisers the ability to have confidence in the audience that they're buying it gives the publisher the ability to speak in the advertisers language so that they can specifically deliver the audience's that they're looking for and this is a real departure from traditional media buying which has been typically based on essentially indexes I want to buy this property because this property index is high from my audience what we're doing this we're flipping that model on that's head and being able to enable the advertiser to say these are the this is the audience I want to go for it here or here are the people the users that we want to reach and here's across the entire web where those people exist and that was really if you think about what's really revolutionary about quantcast is because we see both sides of that marketplace we give the advertiser the ability to find the audience and then because we have that measurement service in place we can tell the advertiser exactly where those those people are so that they know who to go talk to now to buy their audiences and they do that at an impression by an impression level versus just Brown broadly on the sites in its totality now is this what differentiates you from your competition yeah I mean I would say this is really what puts quantcast very unique in the marketplace there are people that do various different kind of portions of the quantcast offering so for example there are measurement companies out there that provide measurement data about properties problem with those is that they have a very what I would say antiquated way in which they provide measurement they provide measurement using panel safe right which don't connect back to impression by impression level address ability because they are panel based there are only a small component of the total audience out on the web our model goes a little bit deeper than that and gives you census level understanding what people are doing you have data companies that provide data but those companies when you provide just single source data you typically have very small audiences because data is not available you know in its entirety for every single person in the US and our model which is all inference based gives you the ability to create predictions it's a predictive model that enables you to push out and make predictions about everyone and what that now does is it gives a marketer scale and when marketers have scaled they have confidence if you think about what's happened in television marketers have confidence in buying audiences across television because there is a currency for audiences they rely on Nielsen to do that digital is very different it's an individual impression my impression addressability and that really distances us from our competition because we excuse me we do have this massive footprint over 10 million publishers carry our measurement pixels that gives us comprehensive visibility of the Internet we have machine learning that creates those predictions about about the consumers and then give the advertisers and publishers access to that on an anonymous basis so that they can then leverage that information to better target the advertising so you talked a little bit about you know the legacy earth at this store achill way to measure audiences panel based are the new ways of measuring and defining target segments is that becoming a little bit more valid than new methodology there was a problem that needed to be solved and the problem was mass the mass amount of the internet was becoming highly fragmented and what needed to happen was a solution needed to come in that could measure the preponderance of the internet panel base were really only able to handle the largest companies and then at that level could not go very granular Lee within those they could measure at a total site level so when we extended down and now can measure individual web assets as small as 500 consumers you now opened up an understanding the internet that you never had before so that was the start right and then what happened after that was really very simply we were able to extend into marketers marketers could never get an understanding other than doing kind of market fielded market research they could never get a real time understanding of who their consumers are now an automotive company can understand precisely the audience that is engaging and configuring a particular car for them and they can then take that and use that to build greater audiences at scale that they can target within their ad servers so we're connecting the essentially that measurement planning buying and delivery process all into one single product 18 months ago when I joined the company we had no marketers that we're using podcasts and even as early as six months ago we hadn't launched yet our product for marketers within the last six months we have hundreds of marketers now that are using the product right and nice when you look at when I say hundreds i'm talking about the top hundred bite marketers that are using the product now the everything from CPG to Pharma to auto to retail and really understanding those nuances about customers you know can you understand what's different about the people consuming a particular diaper product then the people consuming a particular liquid detergent all of a sudden now the CPG manufacturer has very granular information consumer so we have now every major agency is using our product understand audiences are you also helping them a better understand better you the data that they have in-house yes yeah great question so one unique piece about quantcast is we always start with the marketers data so we always start with an event right and the marketer thinks of events in different ways someone might think of it as a click on an ad but the majority of people think about it as tional level right who downloaded a brochure who configured a car who downloaded a coupon and then we have some marketers that work with us and actually pass us data so they passes data anonymously out of their CRM database and now they can get really interesting metrics like what was the shopping cart like for this particular consumer right show me what's they have audience profile someone who purchases five hundred dollars versus someone who purchases a hundred dollars because what people are looking for is we all know there's a there's a very sharp distribution curve when you look at consumption patterns there's a small amount of people that are highly profitable for companies and they want to find and replicate and find more people right that are in that highly profitable customer segment so we do allow marketers to bring in their own data leverage that then against the entire data set that we have you know that that data set then enables them to really create massive extension of audiences but only the audience's that matter only those audiences that are the most profitable for that should having to pay to count your traffic property be illegal illegal that's a strong term I think that quantcast we view that markets are efficient right we've announced a solution into the marketplace that does provide free data for everyone right you can come in and a self-service basis and use that so we think that over time right data is going to become something that is ubiquitous we believe that's important to have out in the marketplace so that people can make better decisions we then take the approach that we will then charge for the use of that data right when you actually want to action you can take an action with a think of it very similar to a stock market data is free in the stock market you can go find a stock quote pretty much from any website but when you want to take action to actually purchase a stalker you want to take action to engage in some sort of transaction you pay for the right to do that and so we think of that similarly in terms of our business right we provide data out to the market because that makes a more intelligent market creates a more efficient market and then we charge for the transaction level activity that happens and you know will our competitors follow suit I don't know you know I think it'll be difficult than active right I think it's one of those things that the market will tell us you know whether our model one that that ultimately prevails but I think that's the great thing about competition is that everyone can put out there they're offering in the market will judge what's the better software for them
