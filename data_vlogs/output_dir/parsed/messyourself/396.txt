so that he wanted to tell me I can't get
involved in this Kate you know what I do
hello everyone how is everyone doing it
is measure selfie at the day lace Jemma
we have got something very special store
because we are going back all the way to
2009 because we are playing Mirror's
Edge babe it now we are going back to
Mirror's Edge for one very special
reason now something that I only just
discovered now it's been here for a very
long time leizerman but you can modify
the game files on this game ok to enable
a third-person view on Mirror's Edge now
just the sound that makes my mind blown
okay because I play this game so much
when it came out ok so just a thought of
a third person view okay I cannot wait
to do this shit okay here we are
we research goddammit this game it gives
me the heebie jeebies Chile whinnies now
I believe I had key binded the third
person of you to f4 wait what's this
I can move what whoa whoa whoa whoa okay
so the first view is sort of like this
noclip view Jesus grass like a fade oh
my goodness what what what's wrong with
our arms is it just me but her arms look
really weird
III don't know okay if I press f4 again
oh oh my goodness it locked it like a
favor
she's buddy head banging
okay so I can move but it seems to
unlock the view up oh my goodness
hey hey why are you dying okay it's come
back the first person but oh so this
view gives you like a still shot oh my
goodness imagine that the cool
cinematics of shit I fell again
oh okay in the last view it seems it's
just a normal third-person view
okay ladies gentlemen now this feels
very weird okay this feels so weird I
played so oh okay got stuck I played so
much Mirror's Edge and it feels so good
just look at things in this few uh I'm
not sure I can make this job okay okay
now I've done a little bit of research
Oh swing okay now I've done a little bit
of research in this but apparently they
they did not like care at all about the
third-person view because obviously it's
a first-person game so there's like a
lot of bugs when it comes to
third-person view
haha roly-poly look at you faith all
right now I believe as a cutscene right
now okay now the cutscene is in third
person if that person does stick but
apparently it's like really buggy so I
can't wait to see that all right fight
stop bloody head banging okay oh okay
cutscene here we go oh oh my god what
hey put your bloody legs Oh
oh my goodness okay okay haha
Jesus Christ it's just me oh wait she's
got mad - normal she looked like she was
bloody disabled or something oh this is
really weird so usually the view is like
this okay but we can then change it see
I can like noclip this bloody cutscene
ah man man I know oh wait were fake what
Oh faith um what happened to your bloody
arm look at how pretty fingers okay then
say what's wrong with your hand look it
up ho bloody arm it is bloody scarier so
that you wanted to tell me I can't get
involved in this Kate
you know what I do what about you
hahahaha oh my goodness uh uh uh guys
I'm getting scared okay okay okay okay
okay I do not like this third-person
view anymore thank you thank you

I think the poop who asked me that what
I love before oh shit this is fact oh my

PC I think I played this game when it
first launched on the ps3 I was this a
ps3 launch tile I can't remember but oh
my goodness now that I'm all grown up
playing this game I played this game
oh look at that buddy Baltic ah look how
she gets over of ledges okay I'm getting
too excited but er yeah this definitely
brings back a whole lot of memories okay
I never thought I would be able to see
things like this it's so weird if you
haven't played the game you're like
Brennan okay okay
it's third-person all right who cares
about that shit wait what's the help but
if you played this game okay and put as
many hours as I have okay this looks so

before
oh god fate buddy jump that shit oh okay
this is so weird to control okay
helicopter can you bloody well piss off
I wonder what bloody uh um oh wow
so like I was gonna say before I wonder
what bloody combat is gonna look like a
third-person okay cuz the combat

first-person doesn't look all that great
to be totally honest okay I don't know
where I'm going now Oh Rollie pollie uh

when I die in by the train okay we're at
the train level now now what I really
want to see oh wait now let's go first
for the third person okay what I really
want to see okay it's me getting hit by
a train can I reverse this guy quickly
