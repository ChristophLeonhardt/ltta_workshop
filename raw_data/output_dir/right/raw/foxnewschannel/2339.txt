00:02:52,774 --> 00:02:54,276

THEY ARE LAYING THE GROUND WORK

85
00:03:08,197 --> 00:03:10,797
HERE FOR SOMETHING REALLY

86
00:03:10,797 --> 00:03:11,199
SIGNIFICANT.

87
00:03:11,199 --> 00:03:11,617
>> YES.

88
00:03:11,617 --> 00:03:15,397
LOOK, THIS IS ALL GOOD NEWS.

89
00:03:15,397 --> 00:03:16,856
THE PRESIDENT DESERVES ALL OF

90
00:03:16,856 --> 00:03:18,407
THE CREDIT FOR WHATEVER HE DID

91
00:03:18,407 --> 00:03:19,707
TO PUSH THE CHINESE TO THE TABLE

92
00:03:19,707 --> 00:03:23,505
IN TERMS OF ENFORCEMENT AND GET

93
00:03:23,505 --> 00:03:27,464
THE SANCTIONS PASSED THROUGH THE

94
00:03:27,464 --> 00:03:31,069
U.N. THAT ARE INFLICTING PAIN ON

95
00:03:31,069 --> 00:03:33,423
THE REGIME IN NORTH KOREA.

96
00:03:33,423 --> 00:03:35,617
THE MEETING LAST NIGHT, IT WAS

97
00:03:35,617 --> 00:03:38,293
NOT UNPRECEDENTED THAT THE 2

98
00:03:38,293 --> 00:03:39,545
SIDES WOULD TALK.

99
00:03:39,545 --> 00:03:41,378
BUT THE PHYSICAL MEETING AND

100
00:03:41,378 --> 00:03:42,332
EVERYTHING BODES WELL.

101
00:03:42,332 --> 00:03:43,797
THEY DIDN'T GET SPECIFIC.

102
00:03:43,797 --> 00:03:45,533
THEY DIDN'T PROMISE TO END THE

103
00:03:45,533 --> 00:03:46,983
KOREAN WAR.

104
00:03:46,983 --> 00:03:49,885
WE DON'T KNOW WHAT -- THEY

105
00:03:49,885 --> 00:03:51,506
DIDN'T COMMIT TO ANY PLEDGES.

106
00:03:51,506 --> 00:03:52,508
IT'S HOPEFUL.

107
00:03:52,508 --> 00:03:54,436
I THOUGHT IT WAS VERY

108
00:03:54,436 --> 00:03:56,344
INTERESTING THAT THE PRESIDENT

109
00:03:56,344 --> 00:04:00,448
TOOK PAINS TO CREDIT PRESIDENT

110
00:04:00,448 --> 00:04:03,066
XI FOR ENFORCING THE SANCTIONS

111
00:04:03,066 --> 00:04:08,807
AND BEING A CREDIBLE PARTNER.

112
00:04:08,807 --> 00:04:10,207
SOUTH KOREAS AND NORTH KOREAS

113
00:04:10,207 --> 00:04:12,654
WOULD LIKE TO SEPARATE US.

114
00:04:12,654 --> 00:04:14,831
THE JAPANESE ARE SKEPTICAL.

115
00:04:14,831 --> 00:04:17,466
A POSSIBLY SCENARIO IS HE

116
00:04:17,466 --> 00:04:18,216
DEVELOPED HIS NUCLEAR WEAPONS

117
00:04:18,216 --> 00:04:19,361
PROGRAM SO FAR HE CAN GET TO THE

118
00:04:19,361 --> 00:04:22,169
TABLE AND SAY, GUESS, WHAT IT'S

119
00:04:22,169 --> 00:04:23,621
BEEN GREAT MEETING WITH YOU.

120
00:04:23,621 --> 00:04:32,179
I MIGHT TALK ABOUT A FREE FREEZE

121
00:04:32,179 --> 00:04:39,981
BUT I DON'T DISMANTLE.

122
00:04:39,981 --> 00:04:40,282
.

123
00:04:40,282 --> 00:04:41,283
>> Bret: THEN THE PRESIDENT SAID

124
00:04:41,283 --> 00:04:44,543
HE WOULD WALK AWAY.

125
00:04:44,543 --> 00:04:45,544
>> YES.

126
00:04:45,544 --> 00:04:47,495
PEOPLE SAY KIM CAN'T BE TRUSTED

127
00:04:47,495 --> 00:04:49,214
AND THE U.S. HAS TO ALWAYS

128
00:04:49,214 --> 00:04:50,898
REWARDS ONLY ACTIONS AND NEVER

129
00:04:50,898 --> 00:04:51,393
PROMISES.

130
00:04:51,393 --> 00:04:52,350
ON THE OTHER HAND, THIS IS A BIG

131
00:04:52,350 --> 00:04:52,694
DEAL.

132
00:04:52,694 --> 00:04:55,497
THERE IS ONE PERSON WHO IS MORE

133
00:04:55,497 --> 00:04:57,204
RESPONSIBLE THAN ANYBODY ELSE

134
00:04:57,204 --> 00:05:00,774
AND THAT IS PRESIDENT TRUMP.

135
00:05:00,774 --> 00:05:03,859
THE SANCTIONS AND THIS ATTITUDE

136
00:05:03,859 --> 00:05:06,311
I MIGHT BE CRAZY ENOUGH TO DO

137
00:05:06,311 --> 00:05:07,633
SOMETHING WHICH SEEMS TO HAVE

138
00:05:07,633 --> 00:05:08,215
MADE SOMETHING HAPPEN.

139
00:05:08,215 --> 00:05:09,668
>> HE IS RIGHT.

140
00:05:09,668 --> 00:05:11,069
WE HAVE NORTH AND SOUTH

141
00:05:11,069 --> 00:05:13,270
AGREEMENTS BEFORE AND SUMMITS

142
00:05:13,270 --> 00:05:16,299
AND JOINT DECLARATIONS.

143
00:05:16,299 --> 00:05:17,519
THE FACT IS THE NORTH KOREA

144
00:05:17,519 --> 00:05:19,621
CONSTITUTION CALLS FOR THE END

145
00:05:19,621 --> 00:05:21,079
OF SOUTH KOREA.

146
00:05:21,079 --> 00:05:22,781
IT HAS SINCE 1953 AND STILL

147
00:05:22,781 --> 00:05:23,125
DOES.

148
00:05:23,125 --> 00:05:24,450
WE HAVE NO SPECIFICS ON.

149
00:05:24,450 --> 00:05:26,083
THAT WE HAVE NOTHING ON HUMAN

150
00:05:26,083 --> 00:05:26,628
RIGHTS HERE.

151
00:05:26,628 --> 00:05:28,735
THE MOST REASSURING THING I HAVE

152
00:05:28,735 --> 00:05:30,232
HEARD IS WHAT YOU JUST REFERRED

153
00:05:30,232 --> 00:05:30,532
TO.

154
00:05:30,532 --> 00:05:32,915
PRESIDENT TRUMP SAID HE IS

155
00:05:32,915 --> 00:05:34,336
WILLING TO WALK AWAY.

156
00:05:34,336 --> 00:05:35,857
I HOPE THE PRESIDENT DOESN'T

157
00:05:35,857 --> 00:05:37,547
FEEL IF HE GETS INTO THESE

158
00:05:37,547 --> 00:05:38,746
MEETINGS, I HAVE TO CUT A DEAL

159
00:05:38,746 --> 00:05:41,650
OR I WILL LOOK LIKE A FAILURE.

160
00:05:41,650 --> 00:05:41,943
NO.

161
00:05:41,943 --> 00:05:44,801
UNLESS YOU GET SOMETHING OF

162
00:05:44,801 --> 00:05:46,548
SUBSTANCE, WALK AWAY.

163
00:05:46,548 --> 00:05:48,857
NORTH KOREA CAN'T BE TRUSTED.

164
00:05:48,857 --> 00:05:51,353
>> Bret: THE PRESIDENT TODAY ON

165
00:05:51,353 --> 00:05:53,461
THE HOUSE INTEL REPORT.

166
00:05:53,461 --> 00:05:57,459
IT SAID NO COLLUSION ON THE

167
00:05:57,459 --> 00:05:58,160
RUSSIAN INVESTIGATION.

168
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:00,442
>> HE WAS HONORED BY THE REPORT.

169
00:06:00,442 --> 00:06:02,764
IT WAS CONCLUSIVE.

170
00:06:02,764 --> 00:06:05,171
NO COLLUSION WITH RUSSIA.

171
00:06:05,171 --> 00:06:11,678
>> THE COMMITTEE DID NOT USE ITS

172
00:06:11,678 --> 00:06:12,997
SUBPOENA POWER FOR BANK AND

173
00:06:12,997 --> 00:06:14,832
PHONE RECORDS.

174
00:06:14,832 --> 00:06:16,633
IT WAS A KINDERGARTEN REPORT.

175
00:06:16,633 --> 00:06:19,286
>> Bret: DEMOCRATS NOT HAPPY

176
00:06:19,286 --> 00:06:23,690
WITH THE REPORT.

177
00:06:23,690 --> 00:06:28,990
THE FINDINGS OF THE RUSSIA CYBER

178
00:06:28,990 --> 00:06:29,293
ATTACKS.

179
00:06:29,293 --> 00:06:30,492
NO EVIDENCE OF COLLUSION BETWEEN

180
00:06:30,492 --> 00:06:35,951
THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN AND RUSSIA.

181
00:06:35,951 --> 00:06:38,500
OPPOSITION RESEARCH MAKES ITS

182
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:42,412
WAY FROM RUSSIA AND THE CLINTON

183
00:06:42,412 --> 00:06:43,523
CAMPAIGN AND THE MEDIA.

184
00:06:43,523 --> 00:06:44,712
ONE OF THE OTHER THINGS THAT

185
00:06:44,712 --> 00:06:47,513
COMES OUT OF IT IS ABOUT MIKE

186
00:06:47,513 --> 00:06:47,835
FLYNN.

187
00:06:47,835 --> 00:06:51,316
I ASKED JIM COMEY ABOUT THAT.

188
00:06:51,316 --> 00:06:56,318
>> DID YOU TELL LAWMAKERS THAT

189
00:06:56,318 --> 00:06:59,621
THE FBI DID NOT BELIEVE THAT

190
00:06:59,621 --> 00:07:03,225
MICHAEL FLYNN WAS LYING

191
00:07:03,225 --> 00:07:03,651
INTENTIONALLY?
