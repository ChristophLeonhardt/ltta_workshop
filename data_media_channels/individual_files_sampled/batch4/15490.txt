the FBI is about to take another major credibility hit and they only have themselves and their partners at the Department of Justice to blame the story is absolutely unbelievable the FBI is now saying they've lost five months of text messages to and from Trump hating senior agent Peter stroked five months of text messages Aman I give you the dates you're gonna understand why that's terrifying now you watch my show you know I'm not a hyperbolic guy I don't exaggerate if I say it's terrifying it's because I genuinely find it terrifying let me say this Anton this number really got to me this morning I thought about it I have been either an active law enforcement officer a partner of law enforcement a law enforcement contractor or an on-air analyst of law enforcement and intelligence issues for 25 years I know my boyish good looks betray that but yeah since 1993 I've been doing this I strap down a gun and a badge and in 1993 and I've been working around it ever since and needless to say I have a lot of experience with this stuff and I have never never in those 25 years I was a little kid a little kid running around I got in a badge in those 25 years I have never seen anything this egregious and I've certainly never seen this many coincidences surrounding the same investigation so what happened here well the FBI is claiming they failed to preserve this is from an excellent Daily Caller story by Chuck Ross they failed to preserve five months worth of text messages to and from Peter Stroeve many with Lisa page they failed to preserve hers as well you know his mistress they were conspiring against Trump and their text messages weren't gray text messages that said Trump was an idiot others said F Trump and the famous one that said quote I want to believe the path you throw out for consideration and Andy's office and the presumably being FBI number two Andrew McCabe a big Democrat the guy whose wife took seven hundred thousand dollars from longtime Clinton ally and fixer then Governor Terry McAuliffe or her state Senate race in Virginia both there's no way Trump gets elected but I'm afraid we can't take that risk it's like an insurance policy in the unlikely event you die before you're 40 so now we have senior FBI officials conspiring against the election of Donald Trump and that's why those terrifying dates are gonna become very very important in just a second I mean they they're mind-blowing ly important and Andy being a reference to Makeev the FBI number two who was complicit in all this well why are the date simple well the dates during which the messages of the the records of those messages failed to be preserved for December 14 2016 the May 17 27 t now why are these two seemingly innocuous dates critically important and why do they scare me as much as they do about this investigation well December 14 2016 was smack dab in the middle of Trump being elected and inaugurated he was president elect Trump but what was being plotted frantically in the weeks before his inauguration even more important even more terrifying may 17th 2017 why is this seemingly innocuous date in the middle of spring May of 2017 important is May 17th 2017 yet ready for this May 17 27 teen was the exact calendar day that Robert Muller was appointed special counsel so text messages from prior to December 14th prior to the election are there text messages between strokin page after Muller's appointment are there while stroke was working with Muller investigating team Trump but in the period right before the inauguration until the day Muller was appointed they're missing and he you believe that that's a coincidence I don't I don't do you believe that that time period is insignificant and coincidental not at all I don't buy it it's not as I tweeted yesterday it's not in the ballpark's parking lot in the parking lot of the ballpark of believability and let me read you what a guy named Ron Stephen Boyd Assistant Attorney General for legislative affairs wrote to the Senate committee it's the Senate Homeland Security and government affairs committee this is what he wrote to that and and this one really makes my blood boil because this guy wow this guy is uh working overtime to cover for the FBI look I've been doing this work a long time I know and I'm reading a spin statement he said that the reason the evidence wasn't preserved was due to quote miss configuration issues related to rollouts provisioning and software upgrades that conflicted with the FBI's collection capabilities now you're telling me at the FBI that has put thousands of people in prison the FBI that leads our nation's cybercrime efforts had bad software installed that deleted their text messages there are thousands of people sitting in in federal prison today as I'm here bringing this to you because of the FBI's meticulous world-renowned evidence preservation protocols especially digital and cyber evidence people are sitting in prison as a result yet the FBI couldn't preserve their own text messages of two of their most senior people people with the most sensitive security clearances communicating on FBI devices the FBI lost that but they can go to wall street and find a 10 year old email in which one guy was cc'd and convict them and said in the federal prison on insider trading they really want you to believe that this guy Boyd goes on to say quote the result was that data that should have been automatically collected and retained for long-term storage and retrieval was not collected I don't believe it I do not believe it for one second a time period the players involved the fact that the FBI does not lose data and and and even worse do you notice that every time the FBI loses something it benefits teams Hillary and Obama they lose a laptop it benefits Hillary they lose emails it benefits Hillary they lose stroke text it benefits Hillary and now the NSA is saying it didn't preserve information from 2016 and 2017 that benefits Hillary the Democrats and team Obama do you believe for a second this is accurate cuz I don't I don't believe anything the FBI is saying anymore I know that's a bold statement but there are simply not this many coincidences in life and there are never this many coincidences with a federal law enforcement agencies at the agency that has the rigid protocols of the FBI coincidences that only benefit one side teams Obama and Hillary who appear apparently weaponized the Department of Justice and the FBI on behalf of Hillary's campaign now I'm also not impressed with senator Johnson because he should be fuming he should be calling for heads to roll he and every other senator every congressman the president and an attorney general Jeff Sessions should be standing on a podium saying to Americans you're gonna have accountability people are gonna go to jail but no senator Johnson typically writes quote the loss of Records for this from this period is concerning he writes that FBI director Ray how about director ray hold people accountable put him in jail or resign or you'll be fired same for you attorney General Sessions this is one of the most egregious political scandals in American history if not be worst it is Obama gate I do not believe for a second that the FBI only coincidentally and innocently loses incriminating evidence on Hillary Clinton Oh Brock Obama but but somehow is able to find reams of evidence on team Trump by the way that can't be corroborated in the phony steel dossier and this all seems to tie into this hashtag released a memo campaign that refers to homeland he houses permanent Select Committee on Intelligence report this memo that shows FISA abuses within the FBI and DOJ this is the memo we're talking about Devon u Nia's the chairman of the House Select Committee on Intelligence permanent Select Committee on Intelligence has compiled a memo that apparently proves proves that the FBI and DOJ used the steel dossier and that's the speculation that's what's starting to slowly leak even though James Comey called it salacious and unverified they presented it to a FISA Court as vetted fact which would be jailable vailable if they lied under oath will be prosecutable if they lied to the judge and they obtained warrants to surveil Donald Trump's and his campaign team this was the weaponization of American law enforcement and intelligence to help a rival political campaign a rival party that's how bad this is and I honestly now believe what Nunez is claiming I believe representative Matt Gaetz I believe representative Ron de santis I believe representative Jim Jordan of Ohio they're always infuriated as I am there are not this many coincidences people need to go to jail heads need to roll because we are really witnessing what I do consider to be one of the worst if not the worst scandal in American political history this is critically important content and I want to bring it to you every day but
