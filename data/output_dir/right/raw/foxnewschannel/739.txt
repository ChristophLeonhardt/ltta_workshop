1
00:00:12,307 --> 00:00:12,907
>> Laura: WE RECENTLY

2
00:00:12,908 --> 00:00:14,375
WITNESSED THAT WEIRD SPECTACLE

3
00:00:14,376 --> 00:00:17,845
OF ALLEY THEY'LL SEE READING

4
00:00:17,846 --> 00:00:19,247
SCRIPTURE TO ATTACK THE

5
00:00:19,248 --> 00:00:20,848
ADMINISTRATION'S IMMIGRATION

6
00:00:20,849 --> 00:00:21,249
POLICY.

7
00:00:21,250 --> 00:00:23,451
THEN JEFF SESSIONS QUOTING THE

8
00:00:27,856 --> 00:00:28,189
DEBATE.

9
00:00:28,190 --> 00:00:29,757
LET'S DISCUSS THAT NOW WITH A

10
00:00:29,758 --> 00:00:31,793
PAIR OF VERY DISTINGUISHED

11
00:00:31,794 --> 00:00:32,493
RELIGIOUS LEADERS AND I'M

12
00:00:32,494 --> 00:00:34,896
DELIGHTED THEY ARE BOTH WITH US.

13
00:00:36,765 --> 00:00:43,471
COUNCIL AND DR. ENGEL.

14
00:00:43,472 --> 00:00:45,239
DR. ENGEL, LET'S START WITH YOU.

15
00:00:45,240 --> 00:00:47,442
YOU ARE ACTUALLY, I THINK A

16
00:00:47,443 --> 00:00:49,444
SUPPORTER OF THE PRESIDENT BUT

17
00:00:49,445 --> 00:00:51,312
YOU DISAGREE WITH HIS POLICY

18
00:00:51,313 --> 00:00:53,414
THAT IT INITIALLY, AT LEAST,

19
00:00:53,415 --> 00:00:55,883
SEPARATED FAMILIES, CHILD IN ONE

20
00:00:55,884 --> 00:00:58,853
AREA, PARENTS MORE AND A FORMAL

21
00:01:03,859 --> 00:01:07,295
AND HE IS TRYING TO DO THE RIGHT

22
00:01:07,296 --> 00:01:08,696
THING HE WANTS TO UPHOLD THE LAW

23
00:01:08,697 --> 00:01:10,865
OF THE LAND, NO DOUBT ABOUT

24
00:01:10,866 --> 00:01:11,332
THAT.

25
00:01:11,333 --> 00:01:13,167
I THINK THE ISSUE THERE WAS TO

26
00:01:13,168 --> 00:01:14,502
PROVIDE PROTECTION WHICH HE

27
00:01:14,503 --> 00:01:19,340
WANTS TO DO AS IT RELATES TO

28
00:01:19,341 --> 00:01:20,908
BORDERS.

29
00:01:20,909 --> 00:01:22,643
AND YOU HAVE TO LOOK AT

30
00:01:22,644 --> 00:01:24,545
PROTECTION, AND HOW DO YOU BRING

31
00:01:24,546 --> 00:01:26,848
THE HUMAN ELEMENT INTO THIS

32
00:01:26,849 --> 00:01:28,249
SITUATION, SO YOU CAN PROVIDE

33
00:01:28,250 --> 00:01:30,818
HUMAN DIGNITY AND RESPECT AND

34
00:01:39,161 --> 00:01:42,897
OUR PRESIDENT WILL STEP UP, IN A

35
00:01:45,467 --> 00:01:47,668
OUR LEADERS WILL DO THE RIGHT

36
00:01:47,669 --> 00:01:49,303
THING AND PROVIDE THAT

37
00:01:49,304 --> 00:01:51,906
PROTECTIVE AND COMPASSIONATE

38
00:01:51,907 --> 00:01:53,708
PIECES TO THIS LEGISLATION.

39
00:01:53,709 --> 00:01:55,977
>> Laura: PASTOR SCOTT, THIS

40
00:01:55,978 --> 00:01:58,713
IS BISHOP MICHAEL CURRY WHO IS

41
00:01:58,714 --> 00:02:00,581
JUST SLAMMING JEFF SESSIONS OR

42
00:02:00,582 --> 00:02:01,716
INVOKING THE BIBLE.

43
00:02:01,717 --> 00:02:02,884
LET'S WATCH.

44
00:02:02,885 --> 00:02:05,920
>> TO OUR CHRISTIANS TO QUOTE

45
00:02:05,921 --> 00:02:08,523
ROMANS 13 OVER JESUS OF NAZARETH

46
00:02:08,524 --> 00:02:11,425
AS IF JESUS OF NAZARETH DOESN'T

47
00:02:11,426 --> 00:02:13,628
EXIST, THAT IS HIGHLY

48
00:02:13,629 --> 00:02:14,662
PROBLEMATIC.

49
00:02:14,663 --> 00:02:18,733
IT'S FLAT OUT HIGHLY UNBIBLICAL,

50
00:02:18,734 --> 00:02:20,234
UNCHRISTIAN AND UN-AMERICAN.

51
00:02:20,235 --> 00:02:21,469
>> Laura: YOUR REACTION TO

52
00:02:21,470 --> 00:02:21,869
THAT?

53
00:02:21,870 --> 00:02:23,304
AND I HAVE SOMETHING TO SAY

54
00:02:29,444 --> 00:02:31,445
ESPECIALLY IF YOU ARE A BIBLE

55
00:02:31,446 --> 00:02:31,846
BELIEVER.

56
00:02:31,847 --> 00:02:33,247
IT'S NOT UNUSUAL TO REFER TO

57
00:02:33,248 --> 00:02:34,882
SCRIPTURE AS A BASIS TO VALIDATE

58
00:02:34,883 --> 00:02:36,717
ANY ACTIONS THAT YOU ENGAGE IN.

59
00:02:36,718 --> 00:02:39,153
ONCE AGAIN, IF YOU ARE A BIBLE

60
00:02:39,154 --> 00:02:40,688
BELIEVER, WE OFTENTIMES USE

61
00:02:40,689 --> 00:02:42,490
SCRIPTURE TO VALIDATE ACTIONS OR

62
00:02:42,491 --> 00:02:44,292
ACTIVITIES THAT WE ENGAGE IN.

63
00:02:47,829 --> 00:02:48,496
SCRIPTURE, BECAUSE THAT

64
00:02:52,100 --> 00:02:54,869
OBEY THE CIVIL AUTHORITIES.

65
00:02:54,870 --> 00:02:56,237
JESUS NOR THE APOSTLE PAUL

66
00:02:56,238 --> 00:02:58,439
ENDORSED SEDITION OR REBELLION

67
00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:00,441
OR A VIOLENT UPRISING AGAINST

68
00:03:00,442 --> 00:03:01,442
ROME AND USING THAT SCRIPTURE,

69
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:06,247
NOT THE WAY.

70
00:03:06,248 --> 00:03:07,481
OBEY THE LAWS OF THE LAND SO

71
00:03:07,482 --> 00:03:09,650
THEY DON'T HAVE A REASON TO

72
00:03:09,651 --> 00:03:10,718
ACCUSE US OF ANY WRONGDOING.

73
00:03:10,719 --> 00:03:12,220
OBEY THE LAWS OF THE LAND AND

74
00:03:12,221 --> 00:03:14,121
PUT OTHER MATTERS INTO THE HANDS

75
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:20,895
WELCOME A STRANGER AND IT'S VERY

76
00:03:20,896 --> 00:03:21,662
POWERFUL.

77
00:03:21,663 --> 00:03:23,164
WELCOME INTO YOUR TABLE, INVITE

78
00:03:23,165 --> 00:03:25,299
A STRANGER TO YOUR HOME FOR

79
00:03:35,377 --> 00:03:36,110
WALL, REALLY NICE WALL.

80
00:03:36,111 --> 00:03:37,878
BUT THAT MEANS ANYONE WHO STEPS

81
00:03:37,879 --> 00:03:39,580
FOOT OVER THE BORDER HAS TO BE

82
00:03:39,581 --> 00:03:42,683
PROCESSED INTO THE COUNTRY AND

83
00:03:42,684 --> 00:03:43,451
RELEASED.

84
00:03:43,452 --> 00:03:46,621
HOW IS THAT WELCOMING THE

85
00:03:49,958 --> 00:03:50,992
THAT DOES NOT MEAN TO BE DEVOID

86
00:03:50,993 --> 00:03:53,861
OF ALL LAWS OF THE LAND TO COME

87
00:03:53,862 --> 00:03:54,762
UP DOES IT?

88
00:03:54,763 --> 00:03:55,663
>> ABSOLUTELY.

89
00:03:55,664 --> 00:03:58,266
AND I GO BACK TO THAT PASSAGE

90
00:03:58,267 --> 00:03:59,934
THE ATTORNEY GENERAL REFERRED TO

91
00:03:59,935 --> 00:04:02,136
IN ROMANS 13 TALKING ABOUT, OBEY

92
00:04:02,137 --> 00:04:03,471
THE LAWS OF THE LAND.

93
00:04:03,472 --> 00:04:06,274
WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT THE CONTEXT

94
00:04:06,275 --> 00:04:09,944
OF GOD'S LAW, GOD'S LAW ALWAYS

95
00:04:09,945 --> 00:04:12,246
FOR PROTECTION, ALWAYS FOR PEACE

96
00:04:14,483 --> 00:04:16,917
ISSUES THAT WE ARE FACING WITH

97
00:04:16,918 --> 00:04:18,185
IMMIGRATION REFORM, ALL THE

98
00:04:18,185 --> 00:04:19,185
ISSUES AND CHALLENGES THAT WE

99
00:04:19,187 --> 00:04:23,924
HAVE SEEN OVER THE LAST COUPLE

100
00:04:23,925 --> 00:04:26,661
WEEKS, YOU HAVE TO HAVE A COME

101
00:04:30,599 --> 00:04:31,632
LOOK AT THE ISSUES OF

102
00:04:31,633 --> 00:04:32,466
COLLABORATING ON PROVIDING

103
00:04:32,467 --> 00:04:33,134
SECURITY AT THE WALL.

104
00:04:38,940 --> 00:04:39,307
FAMILIES.

105
00:04:39,308 --> 00:04:41,475
>> WE ALL DO WHAT WE CAN TO

106
00:04:41,476 --> 00:04:42,176
DONATE TO ORGANIZATIONS THAT

107
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:52,253
CENTRAL AMERICA, SOUTH AMERICA,

108
00:04:52,254 --> 00:04:53,954
AFRICA AND AROUND THE WORLD,

109
00:04:53,955 --> 00:04:55,289
THAT'S WHERE WE AS INDIVIDUALS

110
00:04:55,290 --> 00:04:56,991
CAN MAKE A DIFFERENCE THROUGH

111
00:04:56,992 --> 00:04:59,460
OUR FAITH, OUR CHURCHES AND

112
00:04:59,461 --> 00:04:59,894
ORGANIZATIONS.

113
00:04:59,895 --> 00:05:02,263
IT DOESN'T MEAN WE COMPLETELY

114
00:05:02,264 --> 00:05:03,664
HAVE TO SMASH OUR OWN RULE OF

115
00:05:03,665 --> 00:05:03,931
LAW.

116
00:05:03,932 --> 00:05:05,533
IF YOU HAVE A REALLY SAD LIFE

117
00:05:05,534 --> 00:05:07,201
AND I UNDERSTAND IT'S HORRIBLE,

118
00:05:09,771 --> 00:05:14,475
YOU COME IN.

119
00:05:14,476 --> 00:05:17,978
AND I WANT TO GET PASTOR SCOTT

120
00:05:20,182 --> 00:05:23,317
KNOWN AS FATHER JAMES MARTIN.

121
00:05:23,318 --> 00:05:25,252
HE'S NOT A BIG FAN OF TRUNK TO

122
00:05:25,253 --> 00:05:26,487
PUT IT LIGHTLY.

123
00:05:26,488 --> 00:05:27,755
THAT'S WHAT HE SAID.

124
00:05:27,756 --> 00:05:29,490
>> NO ONE WANTS TO BE A REFUGEE

125
00:05:32,728 --> 00:05:33,861
THEY HAVE LOTS OF GUTS TO DO IT

126
00:05:33,862 --> 00:05:35,763
AND IT'S UP TO US TO WELCOME

127
00:05:37,599 --> 00:05:38,599
OF THESE CHRISTIANS WHO SAY THEY

128
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:40,101
READ THE BIBLE, I DON'T KNOW

129
00:05:40,102 --> 00:05:41,736
WHAT BIBLE THEY ARE READING

130
00:05:41,737 --> 00:05:43,904
BECAUSE THE BIBLE I READ HAS

131
00:05:43,905 --> 00:05:45,306
JESUS REACHING OUT TO THOSE ON

132
00:05:45,307 --> 00:05:48,609
THE MARGINS, INCLUDING AND MOST

133
00:05:48,610 --> 00:05:50,244
ESPECIALLY, MIGRANTS AND

134
00:05:50,245 --> 00:05:50,878
REFUGEES.

135
00:05:50,879 --> 00:05:52,680
>> Laura: PASTOR SCOTT, A LOT

136
00:05:52,681 --> 00:05:53,581
OF AMERICANS FEEL LIKE THEY ARE

137
00:05:53,582 --> 00:05:54,482
ON THE MARGINS.

138
00:05:54,483 --> 00:05:58,753
LIKE TWO BLOCKS FROM WHERE WE

139
00:06:01,990 --> 00:06:05,693
>> THERE IS A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN

140
00:06:05,694 --> 00:06:06,427
MIGRANTS, REFUGEES AND ILLEGAL

141
00:06:06,428 --> 00:06:06,894
IMMIGRANTS.

142
00:06:12,801 --> 00:06:13,901
CRIME WHEN THEY ENDEAVOR TO

143
00:06:13,902 --> 00:06:16,137
SNEAK INTO THIS COUNTRY.

144
00:06:16,138 --> 00:06:17,872
THERE IS A ZERO-TOLERANCE POLICY

145
00:06:20,542 --> 00:06:23,477
BUT THEY TRY TO SNEAK IN

146
00:06:23,478 --> 00:06:23,878
ANYWAYS.

147
00:06:23,879 --> 00:06:26,280
NOW ANYONE, AN AMERICAN CITIZEN

148
00:06:28,650 --> 00:06:30,317
IF THEY DON'T LIKE YOU ARE

149
00:06:30,318 --> 00:06:31,318
ENGAGED IN THE COMMISSION OF A

150
00:06:31,319 --> 00:06:33,354
CRIME AND YOU ARE CAUGHT,

151
00:06:33,355 --> 00:06:35,156
APPREHENDED, AND YOU HAVE A

152
00:06:35,157 --> 00:06:37,124
CHILD IN YOUR CUSTODY, THAT

153
00:06:37,125 --> 00:06:38,259
CHILD WILL BE REMOVED FROM YOUR

154
00:06:38,260 --> 00:06:39,860
CUSTODY AND BE PLACED INTO CHILD

155
00:06:39,861 --> 00:06:40,861
SERVICES UNTIL SOMEONE EITHER

156
00:06:46,635 --> 00:06:50,237
TAKING ANY CULPABILITY FROM THE

157
00:06:50,238 --> 00:06:52,540
CRIME BEING COMMITTED AWAY FROM

158
00:06:52,541 --> 00:06:54,141
THE PARENTS AND MAKE IT JUST

159
00:06:54,142 --> 00:06:56,343
GRABBING KIDS AND PUTTING THEM

160
00:06:56,344 --> 00:06:57,978
INTO CONCENTRATION CAMPS,

161
00:06:57,979 --> 00:06:58,679
BECAUSE THAT'S NOT THE CASE AT

162
00:06:58,680 --> 00:06:58,946
ALL.

163
00:06:58,947 --> 00:07:00,815
THERE IS A CRIME BEING COMMITTED

164
00:07:00,816 --> 00:07:05,753
AND THE CHILDREN ARE IN THE

165
00:07:05,754 --> 00:07:13,260
CUSTODY.

166
00:07:13,261 --> 00:07:13,761
>> Laura: AND ITS

167
00:07:13,762 --> 00:00:00,000
DONALD TRUMP'S FAULT.
