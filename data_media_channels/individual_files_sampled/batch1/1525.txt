hi I'm for me okay what caused anti-government sentiment to flare up in Iran one week after protesters call for an end to high prices and in some cases the removal of iran's clerical elite hundreds rallied this weekend in support of the nation's leadership so what do these demonstrations tell us about what's happening in the country that's today on the stream we're live on al Jazeera and YouTube I'm in the stream some argue the recent uprising in Iran was fueled by president Hassan rouhani's economic policies this video highlights the economic grievances of some Iranians but its authenticity has been clouded by reports the production was backed by Iran's Revolutionary Guards Corps and released just days after protests erupted Reza Marashi of the National Iranian American Council tweeted facts matter with little data and verifiable evidence how do we even know that Iranians believe based on slogans chanted in protests Mohsen Milani says I am skeptical of those who have more answers than questions about the Iran protests others noted the irony of u.s. President Donald Trump tweeting his support for the protesters his administration's travel ban prevents most Iranians from entering the US the protests also drummed up support from leaders who could capitalize on the anti-government sentiment like the last heir to the Iranian monarchy Reza Pahlavi so what my message to the outside world is don't let the Iranian people down yet again don't make the same mistakes as some administration before have done today the people are risking their lives but what they want is to know that the voices have been heard that's my resort and the president-elect of the National Council of resistance of Iran who some say he's a controversial Iranian cult shared a video praising the protesters activist Linda Sarsour wrote in a Facebook post we must also remember as we watch what's unfolding on social media and TV that Iranians are not a monolith so what's really fueling the protests in Iran with hundreds arrested more than 20 killed and a leaderless movement do we know what's behind the recent unrest here with us to discuss in Iran Hamid Mousavi is a professor of political science at the University of Tehran on said we have who sander action is a media analyst and also negaal Mortazavi is a journalist and commentator who will also be bringing us purpose perspective from Farsi speakers online thank you everybody for joining us so much talk about what actually happened in the last two weeks nigga if you could sum it up what happened in Iran what these protests didn't come out of the blue economic protests against austerity measures have been going on for months if not years people have been gathering here and there in front of government buildings and they were scattered there was smaller sometimes even cracked down but this time it was organized and it all started in the religious city of Mashhad which is the second largest city in Iran and like you said reformist activists on the ground believed that this was actually started by the hardliners or the conservative who's at the base for one of the major contenders of their in the previous election against president rouhani is actually in Mashhad but then it escalated it got out of hand and it spread like wildfire into dozens of cities across Iran I've got here a tweet from Syed massive a professor let me just share this with you Syed says because of all the different camps the dynamics are very vague these protests don't even have an artificial personality as a leader the protests directions are sent through telegram app a crowd shows up no manifesto no clear message rights emerge and then everyone goes back home professor how did you see what happened in the last couple of weeks well I would agree that it started with economic grievances now I think whether the hardliners were involved in organizing these protests I think the question is still open you really don't know but nevertheless people have real economic grievances the official unemployment rate in Iran is around 12 percent but when you study the details the unemployment rate for people aged 15 to 29 is actually over 26 percent and this is the official rate perhaps it's even higher than this and as you can imagine young people without jobs are unhappy regardless of this whole issue of hardliners and reformers and we have to consider the fact that Hassan rouhani came into power five years ago on a mandate to improve the economy via a nuclear deal with the West now he was successful in getting the nuclear deal energy economy has arguably improved likely but we haven't really experienced the kind of improvement people were hoping for so so I think there are real grievances regarding the presidency mm-hmm Hussein what just happened from your perspective I actually think it had three phases the first phase was organized by hardliners who actually when defeated a few months ago in the in the last presidential elections from rouhani and actually interestingly enough they were running on a very very serious platform of economic you know grievances and injustice and unemployment and they lost in a landslide so those same people who probably have longer longer longer term plans and they have different things that maybe we're getting to they organised these protests because they wanted to put pressure on rouhani to for different reasons that we might actually get into later and then you keep teasing a deep dive anytime you wanted all right so the second phase was when some people young very young people unemployed men dominated by men and this is a very important point to make came to the street and joined these organized protests that were organized by hardliners a specific group of art miners who were close to the candidate who lost the elections in Mashhad Ibrahim Gracie is his name and then the third phase was when it became violent and I think it was a result of probably media support by hawks us Hawks who have always thought of regime change as the best scenario for Iran so we have to analyze this in three phases and we can't really make any judgments as a whole certain opportunities them then seems to be going on it's like oh people are out in the streets maybe we can join them yeah they always have that yeah we should never forget that the grievances are genuine like the professor was saying and it's not just economic these slogans are now very political they're targeting the entire establishment it started by death to rouhani a chance in Mashhad it went all the way up to the Supreme Leader death to dictator which is another code for supreme leader who's seen as the symbol of the mismanagement in the political and economic situation of the system not just in this administration over a decade and this is something that FIFA people feel angry about and now have a platform to vent it out professor you are professor the universities Tehran yeah it's going if yeah if I can add to that I think we should really distinguish between the protesters and the rioters when the protesters first started about ten days ago in Mashhad for the first few days they were very very peaceful and I think there was a lot of normal people involved regardless of you know if the Conservatives were involved or not but after a while we had some sort of riots in in especially smaller cities the burning of banks the looting of shops yeah the attempt to take over a police station and this is the time when the number of protesters started to decline because of the violence and at the same time the number of casualties started to increase and perhaps I think because of that violence that was one of the reasons why the protests died away otherwise I think if they had been peaceful than they would have perhaps continued interesting hey Hamid here on Twitter says I'd separate protests from unrest which is Ali well the professor says but n what about dad the difference between this time and 2009 was that the middle class didn't joined these this protest and this is a huge huge aspect of the dynamic here because and actually it's another sign that I don't think it was about economy I mean people have problems but this specific protests were not about work was not an organic protest about economy - what I was you know what I was postponing was that this protest was organized by a group of hardliners who wanted to secure the succession - I - how many as the supreme leader rouhani now has a high chance of being the successor to him especially now that another ground another senior ala has been apparently diagnosed as as having cancer this rumoured so now even I mean since last year before the elections that was the the concern because they knew that this would probably be a happening soon the the the the establishment should decide about the successor so I thought oh how many so they groomed their candidate Ibrahim RAC not only for another four years of presidency but actually for a few decades of supreme leadership so with rouhani 'he's victory these plans were shattered and so now they're trying to do other things to bring down rouhani and to take the possibility of the succession title a hominid from him economic reasons potentially for why people would be miserable in Iran have a look at these hotspots people talking about their standard of living how look I'm John Burkhart I'm working but in this society I'm always stressed about the possibility of getting fired the next day always being worried about my job my family the security of my family the main problems people are grappling with are their security the economy and their livelihood there are some who are poor and cannot make ends meet what should they do life is really difficult we're tenants I have a daughter and son both at school the high prices really put me under pressure at home ago solid grievances right there I think so I think what to just actually Hussein was saying the hard line line is to push that all of these economic grievances have to do with the presidency of Hassan rouhani which is not true these are many of them are holdovers from the previous administration there is a high level of corruption there's inequality there's even environmental factors that have led wrong environmental policies that have led to grievances there is serious air pollution in some of the cities where you see the unrest to the level that people can't leave their houses on certain days for health reasons there's shortage of water there's drought so there's a mishmash of all kinds of policies that people are upset but at the end of the day it is their livelihood and everyday situation of the economy that has made them most angry you also have the ability to tap into what people are saying on social media various different networks and when you're looking at what reformists are talking about right now what do you think I actually had a couple of comments I talked to an Iranian journalist a reformist journalist Reihana Tabata buddy in Tehran and she had two main points one is that the dissent has always been going on but along with us amy was saying it's usually not violent that's when you see the majority that's when you see the millions that's when you see the 2009 type of movement happening people participate in election to show a form of dissent they vote for someone like Hassan rouhani who's the furthest from the Supreme Leader to show their dissent but in a peaceful manner without risking their lives the other point she was making was about the react of the Trump administration she was saying that this administration is trying to use sanctions to weaken the central government in Iran sanctions are not going to bring democracy look at the countries around the around Iran in the region where the US has invaded and has or has somehow meddled in and this is not the situation that the Iranians would want to be especially the middle class or the political elite that have kind of stayed away from the streets in these protests what kind of pressure do you feel that these recent protests have put on the government in Iran here let me just share this quote from you here we've protests initially emerging from the middle and the lower class Iranians government is now under a serious demand for reforming economic policies creating job opportunities reforming banking systems etc should the government ignore these demands people will lose trust in rouhani more than ever of course not these are but these but we have to be aware that these are the heritage of two things the previous very corrupt government of Ahmadinejad in - in eight years and then the fact that us Hawks are preventing Iran from benefiting from the the opening that the nuclear agreement was supposed to bring about so the economy I mean the foreign investment has not happened as much as everybody expected for that reason so then we get into a very interesting tacit alliance between the u.s. Hawks and Iran hardliners when it comes to nuclear deal because both sides wants to get rid of it for their own benefits and they also against rouhani or any kind of moderate or reformist because obviously they have another interest because of their plans and their larger goals for for Iran the Americans want regime change the Iran hardliners want a very isolated closed military society so then the same groups of people they do two kinds of exaggerations they exaggerate about two things one is the impact of social media and telegram in inciting violence and in organizing the protest which is an interesting thought topic especially for this program and then the economy they also exaggerate about the impact of economy because the Iranian hardliners want to bash rouhani for that without excuse and then Trump and the US Hawks want to get rid of the nuclear program because of that that's what the US Hawks are focusing on and Iran's support for outside groups instead of spending their money on internal issues if I say if you notice any change since the protesters hit the streets in terms of how the government is reacting to the protests yes so there has been some changes I should point out that one of the reasons perhaps there was a little bit of concern and it's it resulted in the protests to begin with is that the government of rouhani is trying to form its budget for next year and there was a lot of discussion regarding increasing gas prices by 50 percent now in that sort of an increase would have effects on all sorts of prices and they have actually backed away from that proposal in the discussion right now is maybe to increase it by only 10 to 15 percent and also the one other interesting thing that the rouhani government did a few days ago is they have actually banned the import of cars worth over 40 thousand dollars to Iran so it will no longer be able to import mercy this is and you know BMWs and all that and I think this is partly because of they don't want this sort of economic gap to you know for the poorer classes to feel pressured and to become angry also I would regarding the previous discussion if I may add that it is very true that the rouhani government has had actually some successes for example when rouhani came into office the inflation rate was about 40 percent and right now it's about 10 percent nevertheless I think the expectation of the nuclear deal was much higher in Iran people were expecting to you know the economy to improve significant and one of the mechanisms for that was the attraction of foreign direct investment in in reality especially in the past year during the administration of Donald Trump Donald Trump this kind of investment especially from the Europeans has dried up because people become concerned about what the future of Iran u.s. relations will be and as a result they will not invest in Iran resulting in a degradation of the economy basically so I think the Americans are actually partly responsible for this mess to begin with hmm you know I think the Americans are responsible the promises of the nuclear deal these are all issues but also another point about the budget this budget has been one of the most transparent budgets put out by the administration and what people see is these foundations organizations institutions religious entities that don't answer to the elected government that have high budgets whether it be cultural social like I said religious or even economic and they soak up parts of the facts of the finances of the country without being part of the administration or the elected body and basically directly respond to the Supreme Leader that's also something that makes people angry together with the foreign policy with the presidency and everything it's it's like I said a mix of of all these policies and everybody in establishment is seen responsible from the viewpoint of the protesters it's interesting we saw at the very top of the show Reza Pahlavi he's the son of the former Shah of Iran he taught just a few days ago about Iranian authorities not really caring about the people of Iran have a little the core issue is the dismal economic situation that forces people to voice out their anger but it's beyond that now it's going to a point of knowing that the result the reason why you're in such a mess is because of a total not only mismanagement of the system but it's basic non care for the people so this brings me to some of the student activists who were imprisoned omed shares this tweet here talking about the dozens of activists who were imprisoned some of their names as well let me just scroll down so you can seed and then the girl you shared with me a tweet from a member of parliament so here it is in the Farsi and then we translated it tell us more about that and why you wanted to share that with her so this is my mother he's a reformist Member of Parliament from Tehran he's been very vocal not just around around these protests but even before that as far as people's grievances and he has confirmed that one of the protesters who was arrested has died in Evin prison now the reasons are so unclear some point to suicide but he basically is urging or alerting the president his system to prevent another caries Act which is the present prison in 2009 where some of the protesters were arrested and then what they died in their custody I think one very important aspect to this is that the middle class the urban middle class in Iran is not economically that bad in terms of conditions yet that they would you know they would that would bring them into the streets what they care more about is accountability and personal social cultural freedoms and unless there is a huge radical violation of these things in a very abrupt way I don't think the minute they're the middle class would become you know provoked as some other people we're in this in this recent protest and this is what is the core of the problem of the Islamic Republic now you know which is very systematic violations of personal social cultural freedoms which is really I think reaching to a boiling point so this recent protest was I hope that it would be a warning for the rulers of Iran to realize that if next time this if the middle class patience is over then nothing and no one can stop them interesting guess what's really clear from this conversation is that there are so many reasons for the people of Iran to want better from their leadership many many reasons not just one not just about reform not just economics pollution you ever mentioned post earthquake recovery and then on top of all of that international players come into the mix as well I'm sure you've seen this from President Donald Trump such respect for the people of Iran as they tried to take back their corrupt government you will see great support for the United States at the appropriate time professor what do you make of that I I would say the Donald Trump support for the protesters is actually very ridiculous to be honest with you he recently called the Iranian nation and I should emphasize nation and not just the state a terrorist nation perhaps something that made people in Iran actually more angry is that he called the Persian Gulf the Arabian Gulf and I mean he has been trying to sanction the country during the past year relentlessly so to come out and say that he supports the protesters eyes I would say ridiculous but I would say I don't think the protesters really care about Donald Trump that much I mean we've even heard calls of support from a person like Benjamin Netanyahu and I know that you know everyone knows that Iran is real relations for terrible but I think those kind of supports actually hurt the protesters because it creates an image of these protesters being organized or perhaps supported by the enemies of Iran and I I mean Donald Trump is not a very popular person even in the United States so you can imagine how popular he is in Iran and I don't think I don't think those are genuine supports so we have the anniversary of the Iranian Revolution coming up is that another point where people may well take to the streets say I don't think so because the middle class should get involved in the next any kind of next massive protest and I'm there not of that unhappy you go for establishment will definitely be on the street but I think middle class has just six months ago short there descend by participating in election I just wanted to add to the Donald Trump point the travel ban which is severely impacting and also the fact that he's against a nuclear deal which was very popular in Iran all right yes thank you so much for adding complexity to something that seemed quite simple when you watched the international headlines but digging deeper there's so much more so thank you to her saying the GAR professor really appreciate your insight and your analysis today
