IN AMERICA'S ELECTION HEADQUARTERS ON THIS MEMORIAL DAY A QUOTE OFTEN CITED IN MATTERS OF MILITARY CONFLICT. THOSE WHO DO NOT LEARN FROM HISTORY ARE DOOMED TO REPEAT IT TONIGHT A POLITICAL CORONARY HAS TO DO WITH REPEATING MISTAKES OF REPUBLICAN RIVALS. THAT COULD EFFECT THE MID TERMS. FROM THE GOVERNOR'S RACE. WE ARE WRITING THE NEXT CHAPTER OF GEORGIA'S FUTURE. GOVERNOR'S RACE IN TEXAS. TOGETHER WE ARE GOING TO MAKE IT HAPPEN. TO THE CONGRESSIONAL CONTEST IN KENTUCKY SIXTH DISTRICT. CAN YOU BELIEVE THIS? RACE AFTER RACE. PROGRESSIVE BEAT OUT ARE IN DEMOCRATIC PRIMARY. A WIN FOR THE PARTY'S LIBERAL WING BUT SOME DEMOCRATS SAY THOSE CANDIDATES WON'T STAND A CHANCE IN THE GENERAL ELECTION. JUST LIKE TEA PARTY CONSERVATIVES IN YEARS PAST WHO WON THE REPUBLICAN PRIMARY BUT ULTIMATELY LOST AGAINST A DEMOCRAT. THINK TODD ACHIN' THE PRO-LIFE SENATE CANDIDATE FROM MISSOURI WHO ONCE SAID. IF IT'S A LEGITIMATE RAPE, THE FEMALE BODY HAS WAYS TO TRY SHUT THAT WHOLE THING DOWN. HOW ABOUT RICHARD MURDOCK WHO RAN FOR SENATE IN INDIANA AND DESCRIBED PREGNANCY FROM RAPE. SOMETHING THAT GOD INTENDED TO HAPPEN. NOW MANY DEMOCRATIC STRATEGISTS WORRY THESE MID TERMS COULD BE THEIR TEA PARTY MOMENT. DEMOCRATS ARE DEEPLY WORRIED THAT THEIR BEST CHANCE SINCE 2010 TO TAKE THE HOUSE COULD BE EVAPORATING. NOT EVERY STRATEGIST SEES IT THAT WAY. I AM BAFFLED BY THE LEFT IS WINNING NARRATIVE THAT IS OUT THERE RIGHT NOW. I BELIEVE WHAT'S HAPPENED IN THIS ELECTION IS THE QUIET VOICE IN THE MIDDLE HAS COME BACK WITH A VENGEANCE. DOUG SCHOEN SAYS WHAT THOSE STRATEGISTS ARE SAYING PRIVATELY AND SAYING PUBLICLY ARE TWO DIFFERENT THINGS. LOOK AT THE DATA. LOOK AT THE NUMBERS. AND MOST OF ALL LOOK AT THE REAL PANIC THAT IS GOING ON AMONG DEMOCRATS. TALKING POINTS ARE ONE THING. THE STATISTIC CALL TRUTH QUITE ANOTHER. HIS PRESCRIPTION FOR THE PARTY WITH SIX MONTHS TO GO. UNIFY, DEVELOP A MODERATE AGENDA THAT EMPHASIZES GROWTH AND OPPORTUNITY, DOWN PLAY IMPEACHMENT, FIND ANOTHER LEADER OTHER THAN NANCY PELOSI AND TALK ABOUT HOW WE CAN BUILD ALTERNATIVE VERSION OF AMERICA THAN THE TRUMP REPUBLICAN COALITION HAS OFFERED. THE NEXT BIG TEST WILL BE NEXT TUESDAY, JUNE 5TH WITH PRIMARIES IN 8 STATES, INCLUDING CALIFORNIA AND NEW JERSEY. TWO CRITICAL STATES WHERE DEMOCRATS WILL TRY TO SWING
