1
00:00:01,020 --> 00:00:03,810
The hearing to
confirm Judge Brett Kavanaugh

2
00:00:03,810 --> 00:00:06,030
to the Supreme
Court has been long

3
00:00:06,030 --> 00:00:08,900
and at times quite
contentious.

4
00:00:08,900 --> 00:00:11,910
It has also raised a series of legal
questions from our readers

5
00:00:11,910 --> 00:00:14,600
and I’m going to try to
answer some of them.

6
00:00:14,600 --> 00:00:17,640
One theme has been the issue
of Roe v. Wade,

7
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:20,880
the landmark 1973
Supreme Court decision

8
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:22,770
that established a
constitutional right

9
00:00:22,770 --> 00:00:24,210
to abortion.

10
00:00:24,210 --> 00:00:26,080
Senators are
interested, of course,

11
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:28,290
in how Judge
Kavanaugh might vote

12
00:00:28,290 --> 00:00:30,570
should the question of
overturning Roe v. Wade

13
00:00:30,570 --> 00:00:32,240
reach the Supreme Court.

14
00:00:40,720 --> 00:00:42,420
In contemporary American politics,

15
00:00:42,420 --> 00:00:45,000
it’s of course perfectly
fine to ask questions

16
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,690
about faith and Judge
Kavanaugh was asked.

17
00:00:48,690 --> 00:00:51,030
“I am religious
and I am Catholic

18
00:00:51,030 --> 00:00:53,459
and I grew up attending
Catholic schools.”

19
00:00:53,459 --> 00:00:54,750
But it’s a very
different thing

20
00:00:54,750 --> 00:00:56,580
to connect up those
questions of faith

21
00:00:56,580 --> 00:00:58,870
to how a judge might
rule.

22
00:00:58,870 --> 00:01:00,900
Then a number of you
asked about documents

23
00:01:00,900 --> 00:01:02,120
that were released ahead
of the hearing.

24
00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:04,260
Democratic
senators complained

25
00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:06,480
that they’d been denied
access to various kinds

26
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:07,380
of documents —

27
00:01:07,380 --> 00:01:11,950
“We should have a thorough
understanding of the nominee

28
00:01:11,950 --> 00:01:14,947
that’s put before us
so that we can vet them.” —

29
00:01:14,947 --> 00:01:16,530
or that some of the
documents had only

30
00:01:16,530 --> 00:01:18,840
been provided to them
on a so-called committee

31
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:21,700
confidential basis,
making it impossible,

32
00:01:21,700 --> 00:01:23,820
they said, for them to
ask sensible questions

33
00:01:23,820 --> 00:01:25,200
of the nominee.

34
00:01:37,620 --> 00:01:39,330
There’s a lot of
mystery and frustration

35
00:01:39,330 --> 00:01:41,664
about which
documents are where.

36
00:01:41,664 --> 00:01:43,080
The laws governing
these documents

37
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:44,500
are quite complicated.

38
00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:47,359
And whether it’s legal or
not is maybe not exactly

39
00:01:47,359 --> 00:01:48,150
the right question.

40
00:01:48,150 --> 00:01:50,850
The Senate controls
its own processes

41
00:01:50,850 --> 00:01:53,730
and the majority in the
Senate, currently Republican,

42
00:01:53,730 --> 00:01:55,780
for the most part gets to make
the rules.

43
00:01:55,780 --> 00:01:56,910
“Without objection.”

44
00:01:56,910 --> 00:02:00,180
Lastly, people were wondering
how unusual this hearing is.

45
00:02:06,900 --> 00:02:09,270
It’s not at all
unusual for the Senate

46
00:02:09,270 --> 00:02:11,790
to ask nominees to
the Supreme Court

47
00:02:11,790 --> 00:02:14,550
for all of the information
senators can gather

48
00:02:14,550 --> 00:02:17,190
and most nominees turn
over just about everything.

49
00:02:17,190 --> 00:02:19,680
What’s unusual about
Judge Kavanaugh is

50
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:21,100
that in his life

51
00:02:21,100 --> 00:02:24,210
he has generated millions
and millions of documents.

52
00:02:24,210 --> 00:02:26,740
It’s unusual that
he’s not turning over

53
00:02:26,740 --> 00:02:29,201
every single document
that a nominee typically does.

54
00:02:29,201 --> 00:00:00,000
But there are extenuating
circumstances.
