1
00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:05,350
To understand the twists and
turns of doing business in Iran,

2
00:00:05,350 --> 00:00:08,240
look no further
than the Peugeot 405.

3
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:11,610
This boxy, mid-sized
car is everywhere in Iran.

4
00:00:11,610 --> 00:00:13,360
But it’s had a bumpy ride.

5
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:16,195
That’s because doing business
there can be unpredictable.

6
00:00:19,100 --> 00:00:20,460
Peugeot’s a French company

7
00:00:20,460 --> 00:00:22,980
that’s been making cars
for over 100 years.

8
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:24,190
“Because you don’t
get to be

9
00:00:24,190 --> 00:00:26,430
the second-oldest
carmaker in the world

10
00:00:26,430 --> 00:00:28,270
by making second-rate cars.”

11
00:00:28,270 --> 00:00:32,790
But it didn’t start in Iran
until the 1990s.

12
00:00:32,790 --> 00:00:35,370
In Tehran it partnered
with Iran Khodro,

13
00:00:35,370 --> 00:00:38,520
an automaker that’s partly
owned by the Iranian government.

14
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:40,110
It was a huge success.

15
00:00:40,110 --> 00:00:46,070
By the beginning of 2012,
Peugeot was all in on Iran.

16
00:00:46,070 --> 00:00:48,680
It had 30 percent of the
automobile market

17
00:00:48,680 --> 00:00:51,470
and Iran was a major source
of revenue for Peugeot,

18
00:00:51,470 --> 00:00:53,090
second only to France.

19
00:00:56,860 --> 00:00:59,780
And among Iran’s middle class,
owning a Peugeot

20
00:00:59,780 --> 00:01:01,970
meant that you had made it.

21
00:01:01,970 --> 00:01:04,468
But all that changed when
the U.S., European Union

22
00:01:04,468 --> 00:01:06,758
and United Nations imposed
tough sanctions

23
00:01:06,758 --> 00:01:09,660
to make Iran curb
its nuclear program.

24
00:01:09,660 --> 00:01:11,210
International companies
were blocked

25
00:01:11,210 --> 00:01:14,270
from working in Iran,
and Peugeot was forced out.

26
00:01:18,020 --> 00:01:20,920
“Our company was also
a victim of the sanctions.”

27
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:21,890
Seeing an opening,

28
00:01:21,890 --> 00:01:24,610
Chinese car makers leapt
to take Peugeot’s place.

29
00:01:24,610 --> 00:01:28,050
And back home in France,
Peugeot is in decline,

30
00:01:28,050 --> 00:01:31,010
partly because it lost access
to the Iranian market.

31
00:01:31,010 --> 00:01:34,110
By 2014, the company
was slashing jobs

32
00:01:34,110 --> 00:01:36,410
and scrambling
for new financing.

33
00:01:36,410 --> 00:01:37,700
Then this happened.

34
00:01:37,700 --> 00:01:40,070
“Breaking overnight,
a historic deal.”

35
00:01:40,070 --> 00:01:41,570
“We have a real opportunity
to achieve

36
00:01:41,570 --> 00:01:43,310
a comprehensive
peaceful settlement.”

37
00:01:43,310 --> 00:01:46,730
Iran signed a historic
nuclear deal in 2015.

38
00:01:46,730 --> 00:01:49,040
As long as the country
met stringent restrictions

39
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:50,510
on its nuclear program,

40
00:01:50,510 --> 00:01:52,520
foreign investment
could restart.

41
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:54,660
It was a big opportunity
for Peugeot

42
00:01:54,660 --> 00:01:57,780
and the company quickly
moved to take advantage.

43
00:01:57,780 --> 00:02:01,170
In 2016, Peugeot began
investing hundreds of millions

44
00:02:01,170 --> 00:02:05,080
of dollars as part of a renewed
partnership with Iran Khodro.

45
00:02:06,820 --> 00:02:11,000
“It is a real comeback
of PSA in Iran.”

46
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,160
And business was
booming once again.

47
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:16,610
These new deals helped double
sales in the region that year.

48
00:02:16,610 --> 00:02:17,360
But then —

49
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:20,720
“We will be instituting
the highest level

50
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:23,090
of economic sanction.”

51
00:02:23,090 --> 00:02:25,850
Now that the U.S. is pulling
out of the nuclear deal,

52
00:02:25,850 --> 00:02:30,000
Peugeot may be going back
to where it started.

53
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,470
This country, which has been
tied to so many of

54
00:02:32,470 --> 00:02:36,410
the company's ups and downs, 
might be off limits again.

55
00:02:36,410 --> 00:02:38,360
It’s a cautionary
tale for investors

56
00:02:38,360 --> 00:00:00,000
looking to cash in on Iran.
