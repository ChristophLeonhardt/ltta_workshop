1
00:00:01,370 --> 00:00:05,120
You may think you know exactly what race you
are, but how would you prove it if somebody

2
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:10,340
disagreed with you? The fact is, even though
race drives a lot of social and political

3
00:00:10,340 --> 00:00:15,469
outcomes, race isn't real. One of the first
people to attempt to categorize humans according

4
00:00:15,469 --> 00:00:21,570
to race was a german scientist in around 1776.
He came up with 5 different groups according

5
00:00:21,570 --> 00:00:26,240
to physical appearance and geographic origin
of their ancestors. American's of European

6
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:30,890
descent eagerly bought into this type of thinking
around the same time. Some historians have

7
00:00:30,890 --> 00:00:35,070
said the idea that there are different races
helped them resolve the contradiction between

8
00:00:35,070 --> 00:00:40,089
a natural right to freedom and the fact of
slavery. If whites were their own distinct

9
00:00:40,089 --> 00:00:43,820
category, then they could feel a lot better
about denying freedom to people who they labeled

10
00:00:43,820 --> 00:00:49,519
black and decided were fundamentally different.
But as political priorities change, definitions

11
00:00:49,519 --> 00:00:54,699
of race in America adjust right along with
them. For example, if were of Mexican birth

12
00:00:54,699 --> 00:00:59,579
or ancestry in the United States in 1929,
you were considered white. Then, the 1930

13
00:00:59,579 --> 00:01:04,050
census changed that to non-white to limit
immigration. Later, when the US needed to

14
00:01:04,050 --> 00:01:08,060
increase its labor force during World War
II, these people were switched back to white.

15
00:01:08,060 --> 00:01:12,820
And what it took to be "black" once varied
so widely throughout the country, from one

16
00:01:12,820 --> 00:01:18,410
quarter, to one sixteenth, to the infamous
"One drop" of African ancestry, that people

17
00:01:18,410 --> 00:01:24,960
could actually change races just by crossing
state lines. Then, suddenly, in 2000, the

18
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:29,170
government decided that Americans could be
more than one race and added a multi-racial

19
00:01:29,170 --> 00:01:34,070
category to the census. This has left many
Americans scratching their heads when it comes

20
00:01:34,070 --> 00:01:40,000
to selecting who they are. As many as 6.2%
of census respondents selected "Some other

21
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:45,560
race" in the 2010 survey. The idea that someone
might look one way, and identify another way,

22
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:49,820
or that they might be really hard to place
in a racial category, is not new. This is

23
00:01:49,820 --> 00:01:54,560
why there was a public debate about whether
MSNBC's Karen Finney could say she was black,

24
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:59,560
or how we can't even agree on the racial label
assigned to the President of the United States.

25
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:03,960
Of course many people feel their racial identity
is very clear and very permanent, but the

26
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:07,840
fact that some people have changed theres,
and that nobody can really argue with them,

27
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:13,670
shows how shaky the very idea of race is.
This is all because there isn't a race chromosome

28
00:02:13,670 --> 00:02:18,909
in our DNA that people can point to. It simply
doesn't exist. When the medical community

29
00:02:18,909 --> 00:02:23,019
links race to health outcomes, it's really
just using race as a substitute for other

30
00:02:23,019 --> 00:02:27,620
factors, such as where your ancestors came
from, or the experiences of people who may

31
00:02:27,620 --> 00:02:31,989
have been put in the same racial group as
you. Dorothy Roberts explains that sickle-cell

32
00:02:31,989 --> 00:02:37,249
anemia is a prime example of this. The disease
is linked to areas with high rates of malaria,

33
00:02:37,249 --> 00:02:41,639
which includes some parts of Europe and Asia
in addition to Africa. It's not actually about

34
00:02:41,639 --> 00:02:46,680
race at all. This of course does not mean
that the concept of race isn't hugely important

35
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:52,060
in our lives. The racial categories to which
we're assigned can determine real life experiences,

36
00:02:52,060 --> 00:02:55,299
they can drive political outcomes, and they
can even make the difference between life

37
00:02:55,299 --> 00:03:00,920
and death. But understanding that racial categories
are made up can give us an important perspective

38
00:03:00,920 --> 00:00:00,000
on where racism came from in the first place.
