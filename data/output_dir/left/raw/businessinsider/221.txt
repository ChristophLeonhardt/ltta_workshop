1
00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:04,130
- Tax day is April 17th,
but the sooner you file,

2
00:00:04,130 --> 00:00:06,160
the sooner you can get your tax refund.

3
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:09,750
The IRS actually recommends
that American tax payers

4
00:00:09,750 --> 00:00:12,880
file their taxes online and they also say

5
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:15,730
you should request your
refunds via direct deposit.

6
00:00:15,730 --> 00:00:18,720
So we decided to take a closer look at the

7
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:22,250
two most popular online tax filing systems

8
00:00:22,250 --> 00:00:24,050
to see which one is better.

9
00:00:29,250 --> 00:00:32,070
So I'm here with Anya who
beat us all to the punch

10
00:00:32,070 --> 00:00:33,420
when it comes to doing your taxes.

11
00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:36,530
She is a true early bird
and has already filled out

12
00:00:36,530 --> 00:00:40,300
her tax return on not just
one online filing service,

13
00:00:40,300 --> 00:00:42,650
but two and we're here
to find out which one

14
00:00:42,650 --> 00:00:43,940
she liked better.

15
00:00:43,940 --> 00:00:47,270
So what type of taxpayer
would you say you are?

16
00:00:47,270 --> 00:00:49,540
I'm filing one income this year.

17
00:00:49,540 --> 00:00:52,500
Last year, I was filing
two for my business insider

18
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:55,450
internship and from my freelancing gig.

19
00:00:55,450 --> 00:00:57,470
So that was a little more complicated.

20
00:00:57,470 --> 00:01:00,120
This year, I'd say I'm a much
more streamlined taxpayer

21
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:02,150
because I only have one
income to worry about

22
00:01:02,150 --> 00:01:03,160
as opposed to two.

23
00:01:03,160 --> 00:01:06,070
- [Interviewer] Why did you
use Turbo Tax last year and

24
00:01:06,070 --> 00:01:07,460
are there certain taxpayers you think

25
00:01:07,460 --> 00:01:08,620
that it might be better for?

26
00:01:08,620 --> 00:01:11,780
- So last year I started
off using H&R Block.

27
00:01:11,780 --> 00:01:13,330
It was going very well at first,

28
00:01:13,330 --> 00:01:16,570
then when it came time to
file my freelancer income,

29
00:01:16,570 --> 00:01:18,870
I found it much more complicated.

30
00:01:18,870 --> 00:01:21,030
It was quite unclear how to move forward,

31
00:01:21,030 --> 00:01:23,600
so I ended up going to Turbo Tax.

32
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:24,433
It was a breeze.

33
00:01:24,433 --> 00:01:28,030
I just filed, you know, my
regular business insider income

34
00:01:28,030 --> 00:01:30,820
and my freelancer income and
it was not an issue at all.

35
00:01:30,820 --> 00:01:33,040
If you are somebody who has side projects,

36
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:35,430
side hustles, you're a freelancer,

37
00:01:35,430 --> 00:01:37,200
Turbo Tax is probably better.

38
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:39,520
It really allows you
to skip back and forth

39
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:42,270
between different stages of the process.

40
00:01:42,270 --> 00:01:44,610
Seems a bit more acclimated to people who

41
00:01:44,610 --> 00:01:46,260
have multiple sources of income.

42
00:01:46,260 --> 00:01:48,530
- [Interviewer] Which service was easier

43
00:01:48,530 --> 00:01:50,480
to go through the process?

44
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:52,930
- So they were both very
similar in that they both had

45
00:01:52,930 --> 00:01:55,480
very intuitive interfaces that kind of

46
00:01:55,480 --> 00:01:58,180
keep the process flowing
and also answer questions

47
00:01:58,180 --> 00:02:00,300
along the way as you're going through it.

48
00:02:00,300 --> 00:02:02,650
I found H&R Block more streamlined,

49
00:02:02,650 --> 00:02:05,330
a little bit more intuitive than Turbo Tax

50
00:02:05,330 --> 00:02:07,840
but they're both pretty
similar in terms of

51
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:09,320
how you use them.

52
00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:11,750
- [Interviewer] Which
one had something that

53
00:02:11,750 --> 00:02:13,230
really stood out as a pain point?

54
00:02:13,230 --> 00:02:14,630
Something that was kind of annoying.

55
00:02:14,630 --> 00:02:17,300
- Turbo Tax because
they're very pushy about

56
00:02:17,300 --> 00:02:21,440
trying to get you to upgrade
to their paid services.

57
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:23,840
They keep taking you back to the screen

58
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:26,290
where you're able to
select different options

59
00:02:26,290 --> 00:02:28,210
and just basically asking are you sure

60
00:02:28,210 --> 00:02:30,300
you want to do this for
free and it's kind of like,

61
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:32,784
yes, I am sure, and they basically

62
00:02:32,784 --> 00:02:34,910
show you all your information saying,

63
00:02:34,910 --> 00:02:36,570
we did your taxes last year.

64
00:02:36,570 --> 00:02:39,540
You're 50% complete if
you upgrade to plus now.

65
00:02:39,540 --> 00:02:42,460
And when I declined and went
to the free service instead,

66
00:02:42,460 --> 00:02:44,170
it kind of makes a point of showing you

67
00:02:44,170 --> 00:02:47,440
losing all your information
and I felt that was

68
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:48,700
a bit passive aggressive.

69
00:02:48,700 --> 00:02:50,990
And it's a stark contrast to H&R Block

70
00:02:50,990 --> 00:02:53,410
which was very much
easier to use in the sense

71
00:02:53,410 --> 00:02:55,750
it doesn't make you set
up an account right away.

72
00:02:55,750 --> 00:02:57,030
You can kind of go through it.

73
00:02:57,030 --> 00:02:59,310
It does ask you if you want to upgrade,

74
00:02:59,310 --> 00:03:01,010
but it just feels less insistent,

75
00:03:01,010 --> 00:03:02,530
less, you know, making you

76
00:03:02,530 --> 00:03:04,540
second guess yourself essentially.

77
00:03:04,540 --> 00:03:05,880
- [Interviewer] What was
one of the major differences

78
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:08,480
you noticed between the
two different services?

79
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:11,470
- So, H&R Block's service
is incredibly linear

80
00:03:11,470 --> 00:03:13,130
which I liked personally because it just

81
00:03:13,130 --> 00:03:14,490
takes you from beginning to end

82
00:03:14,490 --> 00:03:16,950
and it's a very straight
forward march to the end.

83
00:03:16,950 --> 00:03:19,010
In terms of Turbo Tax,
it really allows you

84
00:03:19,010 --> 00:03:22,010
to jump around more, I felt,
in terms of its interface.

85
00:03:22,010 --> 00:03:25,570
You could start one thing,
leave it, go to something else.

86
00:03:25,570 --> 00:03:27,350
That might appeal to
different personalities

87
00:03:27,350 --> 00:03:28,940
based on how you like to work.

88
00:03:28,940 --> 00:03:29,970
- [Interviewer] Given your experience,

89
00:03:29,970 --> 00:03:33,220
which service would you
ultimately recommend?

90
00:03:33,220 --> 00:03:35,320
- I'd say, if you're like me, and you are

91
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:37,890
filing for one income, both are good.

92
00:03:37,890 --> 00:03:40,110
H&R Block, for me, was
better just in terms

93
00:03:40,110 --> 00:03:42,270
of its interface and the way I was able to

94
00:03:42,270 --> 00:03:44,310
kind of breeze through it essentially.

95
00:03:44,310 --> 00:03:46,880
So if you don't have to worry about other

96
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:49,170
free lancing or side gig income,

97
00:03:49,170 --> 00:03:51,750
I would say H&R Block is probably best.

98
00:03:51,750 --> 00:03:54,830
- Okay cool, so H&R Block is your pick?

99
00:03:54,830 --> 00:03:57,050
- Actually, this year
I'll be using Turbo Tax

100
00:03:57,050 --> 00:03:58,340
to file my taxes.

101
00:03:58,340 --> 00:04:02,280
- That seems like it goes against
what you just said though.

102
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:04,650
- Well, I already have
an account on there.

103
00:04:04,650 --> 00:04:05,483
I'm all set up.

104
00:04:05,483 --> 00:04:07,130
They have all my
information even though they

105
00:04:07,130 --> 00:04:09,130
made a point of stripping it all away

106
00:04:09,130 --> 00:04:11,070
when I didn't upgrade.

107
00:04:11,070 --> 00:04:14,380
I'm used to it and they're
both so similar that

108
00:04:14,380 --> 00:04:16,790
you now, I just feel like
might as well start an

109
00:04:16,790 --> 00:04:18,399
ongoing relationship with one of them

110
00:04:18,399 --> 00:04:21,509
as opposed to switching back and forth.

111
00:04:21,510 --> 00:04:22,343
- That makes sense.

112
00:04:22,343 --> 00:04:24,080
I mean it is nice when you
have all of your tax returns

113
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:26,980
in one place, but if you do
want to switch back and forth

114
00:04:26,980 --> 00:04:29,250
every year, you can just download the PDF

115
00:04:29,250 --> 00:04:31,290
and keep your own digital copy.

116
00:04:31,290 --> 00:04:32,990
Thanks so much for doing your taxes early

117
00:04:32,990 --> 00:04:35,550
so the rest of us could heed your advice.

118
00:04:35,550 --> 00:00:00,000
- Thanks for having me. (laughing)
