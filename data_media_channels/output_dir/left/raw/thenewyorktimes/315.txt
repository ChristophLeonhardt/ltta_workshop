1
00:00:00,580 --> 00:00:05,500
I'm single this year for
the very first time.

2
00:00:05,500 --> 00:00:09,720
All I want is a man who's
not committed a crime.

3
00:00:09,720 --> 00:00:10,860
Oh boy.

4
00:00:10,860 --> 00:00:15,460
But that feels very unlikely
in this landscape we're in

5
00:00:15,460 --> 00:00:18,460
Much to my chagrin.

6
00:00:18,930 --> 00:00:20,890
And so I’m going
on dates

7
00:00:20,890 --> 00:00:22,860
And I'm truck'n along

8
00:00:22,860 --> 00:00:28,530
But then all of these dudes,
they say a million things wrong.

9
00:00:28,530 --> 00:00:32,890
So here's some examples
of the straight dating scene

10
00:00:32,890 --> 00:00:38,410
In two thousand and eighteen.

11
00:00:39,150 --> 00:00:40,160
Hey.

12
00:00:40,290 --> 00:00:41,120
Hey.

13
00:00:41,720 --> 00:00:44,130
Have you
been reading the news?

14
00:00:44,130 --> 00:00:47,400
Yeesh! Maybe let's order some booze?

15
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:50,300
Well, I’d really like
to hear about your views.

16
00:00:50,300 --> 00:00:54,240
This movement's gotten
just a touch out of hand.

17
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:57,750
Well, change only
happens after taking a stand.

18
00:00:57,750 --> 00:01:02,610
Hey! Would you ever want to
come see my band?

19
00:01:03,450 --> 00:01:05,176
What did you say? Ugh!

20
00:01:05,176 --> 00:01:07,670
That's not ok!

21
00:01:07,670 --> 00:01:10,220
I'm feeling triggered
and you've ruined my day.

22
00:01:10,220 --> 00:01:12,140
Hey hey ho ho!

23
00:01:12,140 --> 00:01:14,570
Donald Trump's gotta go!

24
00:01:14,570 --> 00:01:17,740
Join the resistance,
you tone deaf Joe Schmoe.

25
00:01:17,740 --> 00:01:19,620
Singing ooh,
This guy's garbage

26
00:01:19,620 --> 00:01:22,930
Ooh, this guy's clearly a foe.

27
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:27,620
You see we’re victims
of systemic oppression.

28
00:01:27,620 --> 00:01:31,920
Yeah, but thank God we’re in
a time of progression.

29
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:35,320
Your deflection is
a microaggression.

30
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:37,740
I didn’t mean it.
Please don't be mad.

31
00:01:37,740 --> 00:01:40,870
Aw, buddy. Do you have more to add?

32
00:01:40,870 --> 00:01:45,470
Hashtag
not all men are that bad.

33
00:01:46,810 --> 00:01:48,440
What did you say?

34
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:50,300
That's not ok!

35
00:01:50,300 --> 00:01:53,300
I'm feeling triggered in
every which way.

36
00:01:53,300 --> 00:01:55,160
Doesn't that plant look great?

37
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:57,200
Go ahead masturbate

38
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:00,520
While I call Ronan Farrow
to break up this date.

39
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:02,960
Singing ooh,
men are toxic.

40
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:06,200
Oooh,
Why on earth am I straight?

41
00:02:07,210 --> 00:02:10,830
So I think time is up,
I'm done with this

42
00:02:10,830 --> 00:02:13,650
Even though I'm a white feminist

43
00:02:13,650 --> 00:02:16,690
I still need to complain.

44
00:02:16,690 --> 00:02:20,915
Oprah, please save my brain.

45
00:02:21,910 --> 00:02:24,490
So I assume you've roofied my beer.

46
00:02:24,490 --> 00:02:27,100
Geez, that joke is
way too severe.

47
00:02:27,100 --> 00:02:29,590
Well, we’ve had a terrible year.

48
00:02:29,590 --> 00:02:32,260
I swear I sympathize
with your plight.

49
00:02:32,260 --> 00:02:35,730
How? You're a straight
cisgendered man who is white.

50
00:02:35,730 --> 00:02:39,660
Wow, can I say anything right?

51
00:02:41,510 --> 00:02:42,950
What did you say?

52
00:02:42,950 --> 00:02:44,990
That's not ok!

53
00:02:44,990 --> 00:02:48,260
My cat person doesn't exist anyway.

54
00:02:48,260 --> 00:02:49,650
Unless it's my cat.

55
00:02:49,650 --> 00:02:50,640
That's it!

56
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:53,060
I'll marry my cat!

57
00:02:53,060 --> 00:02:55,950
He wouldn't hurt me
because he's not like that.

58
00:02:55,950 --> 00:02:57,050
Singing ooh,

59
00:02:57,050 --> 00:02:59,050
Everyone meet Trent.

60
00:03:01,370 --> 00:03:04,690
Actually, cats can’t consent.

61
00:03:07,343 --> 00:00:00,000
Fair enough.
