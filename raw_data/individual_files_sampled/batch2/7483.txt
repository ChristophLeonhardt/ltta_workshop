Charles Manson is dead he was 83 years old he is a mass murderer back when it was a big deal to be a mass murderer that was back in 1979 and as Huff Post reports Manson was trying to precipitate a race war people often forget about that but he was deeply racist and then put a swastika on his forehead too he was trying to precipitate a race war when he ordered his followers to kill seven people including Sharon Tate a pregnant actress married to famed director Roman Polanski I wanted to just make two quick points about this first of all he originally got death penalty and so did his co-conspirators but then when the Supreme Court overruled the death penalty for some period of time their convictions became life sentences so some people were feared the death penalty says oh it's not good enough for them to rot in jail well Manson rotted in jail for decades and decades and you know the ravings of a lunatic mind in a room by himself going around and around and around the what they did was horrific but that is a pretty significant punishment and I am super glad that he got it so sometimes there is something worse than the death penalty and and he obviously did not belong out in the free world so I'm glad that he served his last days in prison and I think we did the right thing by putting him in prison for life but I wanted also make a second point everybody knows Charles Manson oh you know everybody talks about Charles Manson now stop there's even you know as you know of course Marilyn Manson is named partly after Charles Manson and partly after Marilyn Monroe I mean there's he's in pop culture non-stop because oh my god seven people died well that's now become commonplace so you know some of the other names of the people who did worst massacres in America you might not remember all of them and we certainly don't talk about him at the at the great magnitude that we do with Manson but I want to give you some numbers between 1982 so we try to go back to 1969 when he when these murders happen but there's the data back to 69 it's not as reliable so let's just stick to 1982 2017 there have been 38 incidents where seven or more people were killed so all 38 of those folks are not as famous as Charles Manson you want to know why because back then it was a big deal to kill seven people that was a gigantic deal now we've kind of become accustomed to it here before I show you the names and we don't like to show the names but I wanted to give you that to you in this context because Charles Manson is so famous do you remember who did the Orlando shooting you remember his name maybe some of you do and maybe some of you don't do you even remember the guy who just did the Texas First Baptist Church shooting do you remember the name of the Virginia Tech shooter do your name to remember the name of the Sandy Hook shooter you don't why because we're now used to mass shootings we're now used to massacres that's what they are they're massacres so I'll just remind you of some of the more famous ones davon Kelly was the guy who did the Texas First Baptist Church killing 26 dead Stephen paddock did Las Vegas shooting fifty-eight at Omar Martine the door Orlando shooting 49 Dead Dylan roof also wanted to start a race war did the Charleston shooting nine dead Adam Lanza this Sandy Hook 27 dead James Holmes the Douro theater shooting in Colorado twelve dead soon who each o that the Virginia Tech massacre 32 dead Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold did Columbine 13 dead the reason I give you this story is because I don't want us to get use to the massacres it should be a giant event it should be something extraordinary unfortunately in today's America has become far too ordinary if you like this video you'll love the whole TYT Network check it out at TYT Network comm slash join
