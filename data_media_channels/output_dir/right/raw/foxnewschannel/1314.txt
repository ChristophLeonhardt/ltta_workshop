LISTEN.

14
00:00:18,086 --> 00:00:20,288

INVESTIGATE IT.

20
00:00:27,161 --> 00:00:28,229
AND IT SOUNDS TO ME LIKE

21
00:00:28,229 --> 00:00:32,633
THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT THE FBI

22
00:00:32,633 --> 00:00:33,134
DID.

CAMPAIGN AND SPY ON THE

NO EVIDENCE FOR THAT

PRESIDENT THROUGH AND

HE CALLED THE PRESIDENT'S

THE COMMENTATORS WE JUST

64
00:01:27,822 --> 00:01:28,756
SHOWED THAT YOU ARE CALLING

65
00:01:28,756 --> 00:01:30,157
OUT THE PRESIDENT AND

66
00:01:30,157 --> 00:01:31,692
BASICALLY DEBUNKING HIS

67
00:01:31,692 --> 00:01:32,560
THEORY OF SPY GATE.

68
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:34,261
>> I'M RELYING ON THE

69
00:01:34,261 --> 00:01:35,763
ACCURACY OF WHAT TREY GOWDY

70
00:01:35,763 --> 00:01:37,031
REPORTED TO YOU AND WHAT

71
00:01:37,031 --> 00:01:37,998
CANDIDLY HE TOLD ME ABOUT

72
00:01:37,998 --> 00:01:38,933
BEFORE THE SHOW STARTED

73
00:01:38,933 --> 00:01:39,967
BECAUSE HE KNEW I WAS GOING

74
00:01:39,967 --> 00:01:41,802
TO BE ON LAST NIGHT TO

75
00:01:41,802 --> 00:01:42,136
COMMENT.

76
00:01:42,136 --> 00:01:44,205
HE HAS A TOP SECRET SECURITY

77
00:01:44,205 --> 00:01:44,572
CLEARANCE.

78
00:01:44,572 --> 00:01:46,273
HE SAW ALL THESE DOCUMENTS.

79
00:01:46,273 --> 00:01:47,842
ASSUMING HE SAW THE RIGHT

80
00:01:47,842 --> 00:01:49,777
DOCUMENTS AND WASN'T MISLEAD

81
00:01:49,777 --> 00:01:51,245
BY DEPUTY ATTORNEY GENERAL

82
00:01:51,245 --> 00:01:53,581
ROSENSTEIN OR FBI DIRECTOR

83
00:01:53,581 --> 00:01:55,216
WRAY, WHICH I THINK IS

84
00:01:55,216 --> 00:01:56,417
EXTREMELY UNLIKELY THAT THEY

85
00:01:56,417 --> 00:01:57,718
WOULD HAVE MISLEAD HIM AND

86
00:01:57,718 --> 00:02:00,054
HE BASICALLY SAID YES, THE

87
00:02:00,054 --> 00:02:03,057
FBI USED AN INFORMANT AND BY

88
00:02:03,057 --> 00:02:04,625
THE BOOK, NO, FBI DID NOT

89
00:02:04,625 --> 00:02:07,027
HAVE A SPY INSIDE THE

90
00:02:07,027 --> 00:02:07,962
CAMPAIGN THE PRESIDENT AND

91
00:02:07,962 --> 00:02:10,197
HIS MOST ARTICULATE

92
00:02:10,197 --> 00:02:11,365
SPOKESPERSON THESE DAYS ON

93
00:02:11,365 --> 00:02:13,434
THE LEGAL SIDE, FORMER MAYOR

94
00:02:13,434 --> 00:02:14,902
GIULIANI HAS BEEN CLAIMING.

95
00:02:14,902 --> 00:02:17,338
SO, YES, I DO AGREE.

96
00:02:17,338 --> 00:02:18,072
>> Martha: YOU AND EVERYBODY

97
00:02:18,072 --> 00:02:19,306
ELSE TALKED ABOUT THIS AND

98
00:02:19,306 --> 00:02:20,941
HAVE SAID THAT A SPY AND

99
00:02:20,941 --> 00:02:22,142
INFORMANT ARE BASICALLY THE

100
00:02:22,142 --> 00:02:23,043
SAME THING DEPENDING ON

101
00:02:23,043 --> 00:02:24,244
WHICH SIDE OF THE FENCE YOU

102
00:02:24,244 --> 00:02:24,645
ARE ON.

103
00:02:24,645 --> 00:02:26,447
>> YES, YES.

104
00:02:26,447 --> 00:02:27,081
>> Martha: WHY ARE THEY

105
00:02:27,081 --> 00:02:27,615
DIFFERENT HERE.

106
00:02:27,615 --> 00:02:30,351
>> SPY IS ANOTHER GUY'S

107
00:02:30,351 --> 00:02:32,753
INFORMANT.

108
00:02:32,753 --> 00:02:35,322
INFORMANT IS YOUR GUY.

109
00:02:35,322 --> 00:02:37,224
COMEY SAID FBI AGENT UNDER

110
00:02:37,224 --> 00:02:39,960
COVER IF BY SPYING THEY MEAN

111
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:42,162
A HUMAN BEING GOVERNMENT

112
00:02:42,162 --> 00:02:43,130
AGENT PRETENDING TO BE

113
00:02:43,130 --> 00:02:43,964
SOMEBODY ELSE ON THE INSIDE

114
00:02:43,964 --> 00:02:45,432
OF THE CAMPAIGN WHETHER

115
00:02:45,432 --> 00:02:46,867
RIGHT TO PRIVACY IS

116
00:02:46,867 --> 00:02:47,234
PROTECTED.

117
00:02:47,234 --> 00:02:48,402
WHERE THE 40 AMENDMENT

118
00:02:48,402 --> 00:02:49,036
PROTECTS THE CONVERSATION

119
00:02:49,036 --> 00:02:50,804
THEY WOULD BE THE FIRST ONE.

120
00:02:50,804 --> 00:02:52,339
>> Martha: YOU THINK THE

121
00:02:52,339 --> 00:02:53,373
TRUMP CAMPAIGN BELIEVES FBI

122
00:02:53,373 --> 00:02:54,374
HIRED PERSON WORKING IN THE

123
00:02:54,374 --> 00:02:55,075
CAMPAIGN?

124
00:02:55,075 --> 00:02:56,643
>> PRETENDING TO BE SOMEBODY

125
00:02:56,643 --> 00:02:56,944
ELSE.

126
00:02:56,944 --> 00:02:58,378
AN AGENT OF THE GOVERNMENT.

127
00:02:58,378 --> 00:02:59,980
FOR THAT THEY NEED A SEARCH

128
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:00,314
WARRANT.

129
00:03:00,314 --> 00:03:02,349
AND THAT'S WHAT TREY GOWDY

130
00:03:02,349 --> 00:03:04,151
SAYS THERE IS ZERO EVIDENCE

131
00:03:04,151 --> 00:03:04,484
OF.

132
00:03:04,484 --> 00:03:05,385
>> Martha: I'M NOT SURE THAT

133
00:03:05,385 --> 00:03:06,320
THEY HAVE CLEARLY SAID THAT

134
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:07,321
THEY BELIEF THAT IT WAS

135
00:03:07,321 --> 00:03:08,555
SOMEONE WHO WAS BEING PAID

136
00:03:08,555 --> 00:03:09,957
BY THE FBI AND WHO WAS

137
00:03:09,957 --> 00:03:12,860
WORKING IN THE CAMPAIGN.

138
00:03:12,860 --> 00:03:13,694
ARE THEY TALKING ABOUT THE

139
00:03:13,694 --> 00:03:14,628
SAME PERSON THAT WE'RE ALL

140
00:03:14,628 --> 00:03:16,029
TALKING ABOUT?

141
00:03:16,029 --> 00:03:17,231
SOMEONE WHO IS ON THE

142
00:03:17,231 --> 00:03:17,898
PERIPHERY OF THE CAMPAIGN

143
00:03:17,898 --> 00:03:19,499
WHO WAS, YOU KNOW, BASICALLY

144
00:03:19,499 --> 00:03:23,303
EMAILING OUT OF THE BLUE,

145
00:03:23,437 --> 00:03:24,938
PAPADOPOULOS AND SAYING HEY,

146
00:03:24,938 --> 00:03:25,906
LET'S MEET UP.

147
00:03:25,906 --> 00:03:27,241
I WOULD LIKE TO TALK TO YOU.

148
00:03:27,241 --> 00:03:28,108
CLEARLY FISHING TO SEE IF

149
00:03:28,108 --> 00:03:29,243
THE RUSSIANS WERE GOING

150
00:03:29,243 --> 00:03:30,043
AFTER THEM.

151
00:03:30,043 --> 00:03:30,978
AND THERE IS NO PROBLEM WITH

152
00:03:30,978 --> 00:03:32,045
THAT BUT AREN'T WE ALL

153
00:03:32,045 --> 00:03:33,280
TALKING ABOUT THE SAME

154
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:33,580
THING?

155
00:03:33,580 --> 00:03:34,681
>> NOT ONLY IS THERE NO

156
00:03:34,681 --> 00:03:36,316
PROBLEM WITH THAT, IT IS

157
00:03:36,316 --> 00:03:37,050
UNREMARKABLE THAT WE ARE

158
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:38,185
TALKING ABOUT IT, BECAUSE

159
00:03:38,185 --> 00:03:39,286
THE GOVERNMENT DOES THIS ALL

160
00:03:39,286 --> 00:03:40,287
THE TIME.

161
00:03:40,287 --> 00:03:41,388
RUDY GIULIANI PERFECTED THIS

162
00:03:41,388 --> 00:03:42,589
WHEN HE WAS THE U.S.

163
00:03:42,589 --> 00:03:44,191
ATTORNEY AND WAS UPHELD BY

164
00:03:44,191 --> 00:03:45,192
THE COURTS.

165
00:03:45,192 --> 00:03:48,729
YOU SEND WHO PRETEND TO BE

166
00:03:48,729 --> 00:03:49,629
SOMEBODY OTHER THAN THEY ARE

167
00:03:49,629 --> 00:03:50,630
TO HAVE A CONVERSATION IN A

168
00:03:50,630 --> 00:03:51,231
PUBLIC PLACE.

169
00:03:51,231 --> 00:03:52,366
THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT.

170
00:03:52,366 --> 00:03:53,433
BECAUSE, IN A PUBLIC PLACE,

171
00:03:53,433 --> 00:03:54,501
THE FOURTH AMENDMENT DOES

172
00:03:54,501 --> 00:03:55,402
NOT PERTAIN.

173
00:03:55,402 --> 00:03:56,837
IF SOMEBODY SHOWS UP AND

174
00:03:56,837 --> 00:03:58,271
SAYS I WANT TO WORK FOR THE

175
00:03:58,271 --> 00:03:59,506
CAMPAIGN AND MAKES HIS WAY

176
00:03:59,506 --> 00:04:00,507
TO THE INSIDE AND THAT

177
00:04:00,507 --> 00:04:02,509
PERSON IS REALLY AN

178
00:04:02,509 --> 00:04:04,378
UNDERCOVER FBI AGENT?

179
00:04:04,378 --> 00:04:04,945
>> Martha: SOME THESE

180
00:04:04,945 --> 00:04:05,779
PERIPHERAL FOLKS ON THE

181
00:04:05,779 --> 00:04:07,481
CAMPAIGN WERE BEING

182
00:04:07,481 --> 00:04:10,851
APPROACHED BY RUSSIANS DID

183
00:04:10,851 --> 00:04:12,352
RUSSIANS COME UP TO SAY AND

184
00:04:12,352 --> 00:04:13,286
I HAVE DIRT ON HILLARY

185
00:04:13,286 --> 00:04:14,354
CLINTON AND DID THEY GO BACK

186
00:04:14,354 --> 00:04:15,188
AND FORTH ON THAT?

187
00:04:15,188 --> 00:04:16,957
>> THOSE ARE LAWFUL

188
00:04:16,957 --> 00:04:17,624
CONVERSATIONS.

189
00:04:17,624 --> 00:04:18,257
>> Martha: ABSOLUTELY.

190
00:04:18,257 --> 00:04:19,593
HERE'S WHAT'S DIFFERENT IN

191
00:04:19,593 --> 00:04:20,459
THIS SITUATION.

192
00:04:20,459 --> 00:04:21,962
THIS IS THE MIDDLE OF A

193
00:04:21,962 --> 00:04:23,230
PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN,

194
00:04:23,230 --> 00:04:23,930
RIGHT?

195
00:04:23,930 --> 00:04:25,999
DO ANY DIFFERENT RULES APPLY

196
00:04:25,999 --> 00:04:27,701
GIVEN THE FACT THAT THE

197
00:04:27,701 --> 00:04:29,469
OUTCOME OF THIS MOMENT IS

198
00:04:29,469 --> 00:04:32,406
GOING TO PRODUCE A NEW

199
00:04:32,406 --> 00:04:33,073
PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED

200
00:04:33,073 --> 00:04:33,407
STATES?

201
00:04:33,407 --> 00:04:35,542
DID THEY HAVE AND YOU SAID

202
00:04:35,542 --> 00:04:36,643
LAST NIGHT THAT'S A JUDGMENT

203
00:04:36,643 --> 00:04:37,711
CALL WHEN I ASKED YOU ABOUT

204
00:04:37,711 --> 00:04:38,245
THAT.

205
00:04:38,245 --> 00:04:40,013
DID THEY HAVE THE ONUS ON

206
00:04:40,013 --> 00:04:42,516
THEM TO SAY AND AS TREY

207
00:04:42,516 --> 00:04:43,884
GOWDY POINTED OUT THE

208
00:04:43,884 --> 00:04:44,785
PRESIDENT SAID LOOK, IF

209
00:04:44,785 --> 00:04:45,786
THERE IS SOMEBODY I OBJECT

210
00:04:45,786 --> 00:04:47,254
FILL TRADING THE CAMPAIGN.

211
00:04:47,254 --> 00:04:48,021
SOMEBODY TRYING TO SPEAK TO

212
00:04:48,021 --> 00:04:49,756
MY FOLKS FROM RUSSIA, I WANT

213
00:04:49,756 --> 00:04:52,125
TO KNOW ABOUT IT.

214
00:04:52,125 --> 00:04:52,759
>> Judge: I REALLY DON'T

215
00:04:52,759 --> 00:04:53,059
KNOW.

216
00:04:53,059 --> 00:04:54,060
I TOLD YOU LAST NIGHT IF I

217
00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:55,028
WERE MAKING THE CALLS, I

218
00:04:55,028 --> 00:04:56,830
WOULD HAVE TOLD YOU THE

219
00:04:56,830 --> 00:04:57,264
CANDIDATE.

220
00:04:57,264 --> 00:04:57,931
>> Martha: WHY DIDN'T THEY.

221
00:04:57,931 --> 00:04:58,899
>> OR THE CAMPAIGN MANAGER.

222
00:04:58,899 --> 00:05:00,567
THEY MADE A JUDGMENT NOT TO.

223
00:05:00,567 --> 00:05:01,501
>> Martha: WHAT'S THE

224
00:05:01,501 --> 00:05:03,136
MOTIVATION NOT TO?

225
00:05:03,136 --> 00:05:03,803
>> Judge: THEY HAVEN'T SAID.

226
00:05:03,803 --> 00:05:05,639
EITHER THEIR PRESENCE WAS

227
00:05:05,639 --> 00:05:07,507
ILLICIT OR THEY THOUGHT BY

228
00:05:07,507 --> 00:05:08,508
TELLING MORE PEOPLE THAN

229
00:05:08,508 --> 00:05:10,076
NECESSARY THE WORD WOULD GET

230
00:05:10,076 --> 00:05:10,410
OUT.

231
00:05:10,410 --> 00:05:11,044
>> Martha: HOW ABOUT THIS

232
00:05:11,044 --> 00:05:12,545
IDEA THAT IT DRIVES UP YOUR

233
00:05:12,545 --> 00:05:14,680
LEAD INTO THE CAMPAIGN?

234
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:15,548
>> Judge: IT MAY VERY WELL

235
00:05:15,548 --> 00:05:17,950
DO THAT THAT WOULD BE A VERY

236
00:05:17,950 --> 00:05:19,318
LEGITIMATE LAW ENFORCEMENT

237
00:05:19,318 --> 00:05:20,620
BASED REASON FOR NOT

238
00:05:20,620 --> 00:05:22,321
ANNOUNCING YOUR PRESENCE.

239
00:05:22,321 --> 00:05:25,458
THAT'S A JUDGMENT CALL.

240
00:05:25,458 --> 00:05:26,125
>> Martha: JAMES COMEY SAID

241
00:05:26,125 --> 00:05:27,093
HE WAS COMPELLED HE HAD TO

242
00:05:27,093 --> 00:05:27,994
TELL THE PRESIDENT ABOUT

243
00:05:27,994 --> 00:05:28,594
THAT PIECE.

244
00:05:28,594 --> 00:05:29,862
BUT NOT ANY OF THE OTHER

245
00:05:29,862 --> 00:05:30,596
STUFF.

246
00:05:30,596 --> 00:05:31,697
SO DO THEY MAKE THAT

247
00:05:31,697 --> 00:05:32,899
JUDGMENT CALL AND NOT THE

248
00:05:32,899 --> 00:05:34,233
REST OF THE STORY?

249
00:05:34,233 --> 00:05:35,635
>> YOU ARE ASKING THE WRONG

250
00:05:35,635 --> 00:05:36,402
PERSON.

251
00:05:36,402 --> 00:05:37,703
YOU WILL HAVE TO ASK COMEY

252
00:05:37,703 --> 00:05:38,604
IF HE EVER WAS WILLING TO

253
00:05:38,604 --> 00:05:39,272
SIT HERE.

254
00:05:39,272 --> 00:05:40,640
AS I TOLD YOU LAST NIGHT, I

255
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:41,441
DISAGREE WITH THEIR DECISION

256
00:05:41,441 --> 00:05:42,842
NOT TO TELL TRUMP.

257
00:05:42,842 --> 00:05:44,477
PAUSE, IF I WERE THE

258
00:05:44,477 --> 00:05:45,311
CANDIDATE, I WOULD WANT TO

259
00:05:45,311 --> 00:05:45,611
KNOW.

260
00:05:45,611 --> 00:05:46,779
WAIT A MINUTE, MY CAMPAIGN

261
00:05:46,779 --> 00:05:47,980
IS SURROUNDED BY THE FBI AND

262
00:05:47,980 --> 00:05:49,182
THEY CLAIM THEY ARE HERE TO

263
00:05:49,182 --> 00:05:49,582
PROTECT ME?

264
00:05:49,582 --> 00:05:51,117
I WOULD WANT TO KNOW ABOUT

265
00:05:51,117 --> 00:05:51,551
IT.

266
00:05:51,551 --> 00:05:52,251
>> Martha: REASON IT RAISES

267
00:05:52,251 --> 00:05:53,052
ALL THESE QUESTIONS FOR THE

268
00:05:53,052 --> 00:05:53,953
PRESIDENT BECAUSE HE KNOWS

269
00:05:53,953 --> 00:05:54,921
THE PEOPLE RUNNING THE

270
00:05:54,921 --> 00:05:56,389
INVESTIGATION WERE SAYING

271
00:05:56,389 --> 00:05:57,590
ALL THESE NASTY THINGS ABOUT

272
00:05:57,590 --> 00:05:59,559
HIM IN A TEXT MESSAGES.

273
00:05:59,559 --> 00:06:01,561
>> RIGHT.

274
00:06:01,561 --> 00:06:02,395
>> Martha: MORE THAN THAT.

275
00:06:02,395 --> 00:06:03,563
>> AGAIN, WE ARE TALKING

276
00:06:03,563 --> 00:06:04,497
ABOUT THE PROFESSOR, WHOSE

277
00:06:04,497 --> 00:06:05,731
NAME WE ARE NOT SUPPOSED TO

278
00:06:05,731 --> 00:06:07,400
USE HERE, HAVING

279
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:08,067
CONVERSATIONS IN PUBLIC

280
00:06:08,067 --> 00:06:09,602
PLACES WITH CARTER PAGE,

281
00:06:09,602 --> 00:06:11,971
WITH SAM CLOVIS, WITH GEORGE

282
00:06:11,971 --> 00:06:12,471
PAPADOPOULOS.

283
00:06:12,471 --> 00:06:13,105
>> Martha: NOTHING ILLEGAL

284
00:06:13,105 --> 00:06:13,806
ABOUT THAT.

285
00:06:13,806 --> 00:06:14,340
>> CORRECT.

286
00:06:14,340 --> 00:06:15,208
TALKING ABOUT A HUMAN BEING

287
00:06:15,208 --> 00:06:16,409
WHO MADE IT TO THE INSIDE OF

288
00:06:16,409 --> 00:06:17,643
THE CAMPAIGN.

289
00:06:17,643 --> 00:06:18,344
>> Martha: THAT'S DIFFERENT.

290
00:06:18,344 --> 00:06:19,745
>> THEY THOUGHT IT WAS A

291
00:06:19,745 --> 00:06:20,680
CAMPAIGN WORKER AND THOUGHT

292
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:21,747
IT WAS AN FBI AGENT.

293
00:06:21,747 --> 00:06:22,548
THEY NEED A SEARCH WARRANT

294
00:06:22,548 --> 00:06:23,716
FOR THAT AND FOR THAT THERE

295
00:06:23,716 --> 00:06:25,151
IS NO EVIDENCE.

296
00:06:25,151 --> 00:06:25,785
>> Martha: JEFF SESSIONS,

297
00:06:25,785 --> 00:06:27,186
THE PRESIDENT SAYS YOU KNOW

298
00:06:27,186 --> 00:06:27,587
WHAT?

299
00:06:27,587 --> 00:06:28,454
I SHOULDN'T HAVE HIRED HIM

300
00:06:28,454 --> 00:06:29,555
THERE ARE A LOT OF GOOD

301
00:06:29,555 --> 00:06:30,089
LAWYERS OUT THERE.

302
00:06:30,089 --> 00:06:31,324
>> THE PRESIDENT IS RIGHT.

303
00:06:31,324 --> 00:06:32,558
IT PAINS ME TO SAY IT

304
00:06:32,558 --> 00:06:33,459
BECAUSE HE HAS BEEN A FRIEND

305
00:06:33,459 --> 00:06:34,994
OF MINE FOR 20 YEARS.

306
00:06:34,994 --> 00:06:35,828
THE PRESIDENT IS RIGHT.

307
00:06:35,828 --> 00:06:37,330
THE PRESIDENT IS ENTITLED TO

308
00:06:37,330 --> 00:06:37,964
AN ATTORNEY GENERAL WITH

309
00:06:37,964 --> 00:06:40,399
WHOM HE HAS AN OPEN

310
00:06:40,399 --> 00:06:41,400
CONVERSATION, AN OPEN LEVEL

311
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:42,835
OF COMMUNICATION WITH GREAT

312
00:06:42,835 --> 00:06:43,269
CONFIDENCE.

313
00:06:43,269 --> 00:06:45,004
SORT OF LIKE BOBBY AND JACK

314
00:06:45,004 --> 00:06:46,839
KENNEDY HAD.

315
00:06:46,839 --> 00:06:48,975
ALMOST -- MITCHELL WENT TO

316
00:06:48,975 --> 00:06:49,275
JAIL.

317
00:06:49,275 --> 00:06:51,711
LIKE NIXON AND MITCHELL HAD.

318
00:06:51,711 --> 00:06:52,311
INFINITE LEVEL OF

319
00:06:52,311 --> 00:06:52,745
COMMUNICATION.

320
00:06:52,745 --> 00:06:53,579
NOT ONE WHERE THE PRESIDENT

321
00:06:53,579 --> 00:00:00,000
IS AFRAID OF WHAT HE IS
