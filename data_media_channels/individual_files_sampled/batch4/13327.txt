all right Steve bannon's in trouble again at a gathering in Florida the Breitbart firebrand claimed that there's a special room in hell for never Trump Republicans than Charles Manson died and reported that no it's all just one big lake of fire Bannon has yet to retract the statement speaking of special rooms in hell Michael Knowles will be in this room with us to discuss Thanksgiving trigger warning I'm Andrew Clavin and this is the Andrew Clavin show so if if there are special rooms in hell are they better than the other rooms in hell they're worse like do you get you have to reserve like a special and it's like are all the like the rapists and murders in one place and then the the never Trump Republicans get a kind of nice slightly nicer room in hell I don't you know I just I just whose wondered how that works why are there always special rooms and how I seems like you could cover that anyway never mind the clay villas weekend has come to an end for those of you who are listening to another kingdom it wasn't quite as bad for Charles Manson he wasn't listening that's the way it goes he is our podcast that Knowles and I are doing over at iTunes and ricochet it is a fantasy thriller we'll talk more about it when Knowles gets here but you know while I was doing this when we were dudes I had no idea this sounds silly but I have no idea how to do a podcast it's absolutely true you know when you have to be the guy putting it up and getting it all together it becomes very complicated and Knowles and I have talked about the fact that we felt that Satan was working against us because every single thing went wrong but I actually I went on Skillshare this collection of classes online classes that teaches you about different things so you go on Skillshare

because it really does teach you all kinds of things even like calligraphy crazy stuff like that photography things that you you might not have tried before that you might learn a lot about so I got to talk about it I'm gonna talk about the sex skills I love the fact that the Glen thrush the New York Times White House reporter has now caught up he's women saying that he got him drunk and started mashing them and all this stuff and I the only reason I like that is cuz thrush is one of the guys who was exposed in some of the WikiLeaks emails as sharing his material with the Clinton campaign and he said you know oh I'm it just a hack so you tell me what to write basically I'm a hack and the New York Times hired him to cover the White House along with Maggie Haberman who is also identified by the Clinton campaign so the fact that he's now actually you know who would who would have believed that a guy who declares himself a hack also had some other problems that it might be a problem for the I think he's been suspended by the times while they investigate but before we get to I have to talk about Charles Manson obviously the mass murderer cult leader who died at 83 in prison and the reason I want to talk about you know I spent my life as a crime writer room a crime novelist I write crime novels and I started out very early on that I wanted to write novels that had meaning that were rich that were visionary that had a vision included a vision and weren't just about who killed who and what action scene and all that I wanted to do all that stuff so you would get so wrapped up in the story and it would only be later as you were kind of coming back out of the story that you would start to think yeah there was also a kind of a rich idea of what life is like and if you're listening to another Kingdom you'll see it's not just a story about like ogres and and monsters and murder it's also a story this presents a vision of the world it's not just political it's also personal and religious and all kinds of things but it's all but it's all kind of wrapped up in the story and as I was looking at Charles Manson's story reminding myself of what it was it came to me like a crime novel and I started to realize you know this was in some ways a meaningful a meaningful story I mean Manson Manson was just a complete loser from the beginning I mean it's if you could have pity for somebody who did so much evil you would have to have pity for him he was the child the bastard child of a prostitute he was born when he was born this is kind of awful it's kind of heartbreaking on his birth certificate it said no name Maddox that was his name no name Maddox because nobody knew whose father was nobody knew you know he's just this this hooker basically gave birth to him obviously I think he was sexually abused obviously he was psychopathic he was in the system so much he was imprisoned so much of his life even before the murders and everything that he begged them to keep him in prison he said he didn't know how to live outside of prison he wished they would keep him but they but they didn't send him out and then I don't know how else to put this Manson got his big break and his big break was the 60s and in the 60s you know people don't remember now how things fell apart they see the hippies they see Woodstock but they don't remember that the very fabric of American life kind of deteriorated in certain segments of society in certain segments of society if you looked at it it was still going on as if it were still the 50s but certain segments of society college campuses you know places where the young people gathered the underground artistic life they really came apart at the seams it's hard you know it's hard to tell you what it was like to live through some of that as a little kid or I really I was a teenager I shouldn't say a little kid that you know we had a when I was a kid we had a health class and it was taught by Miss Rose from Florida I'm sure she's passed away by now but like Miss Rose was the like a nice southern lady who came in and she came in and this was her first year and she came in to teach us about health it was called health but is really sex ed that's what it was and so she would come in and she would teach us how to be proper ladies and gentlemen and meanwhile things had so fallen apart and I grew up in a very pleasant nice suburb things had so fallen apart that I've been sitting next to a girl I was sleeping with the the girl another girl that right down the row had had an abortion guys were taking drugs everybody was screwing everybody else I mean it and if you had asked us a year before we would have told you that we would be virgins when we were married I mean that's how fast it fell apart it was really like if you'd been talking yeah I think it would be the right thing to do too and we weren't religious or anything was just a way everybody sort of felt you know yeah you know maybe maybe you'd have a fling with a bad girl or something like that and then you'd get married that was kind of the way you thought and the next year you know like I was 15 you were sleeping with nice girls and everybody was doing it it was just what was being done so it was a complete unraveling if it was unraveling where I was and a fairly staid well-put-together suburbs just think of what was happening in you know in other places now Manson wanted to be a singer-songwriter that was kind of the dream he had and by just by chance he kind of bumped into Dennis Wilson of the Beach Boys and The Beach Boys actually recorded one of his songs which was just awful it's oh it's just a terrible terrible song but it I don't think they released it until after he became famous with the murder that plays just a little bit it was just terrible it's called something like never learned not to love or something like this but you know the other thing I want to point out about this about the sixties of course is it's also hard for people now who didn't live through it to understand that we thought even I for about six months although I was so cynical even as a kid that I didn't really buy into it but people thought that the new world had come upon us a new paradise there was not going to be any war it was gonna be the Age of Aquarius we're all gonna love one another the sexual freedom and a lot of times people say people say oh it was the pill the pill brought all the sexual freedom but that's only half true you know the the idea of sexual freedom has been in the Western consciousness from the beginning the idea that marriage is prison the idea that marriage strangles the soul and our sexual life should be free that's been with us for hundreds and hundreds of years the pill just made it more possible that you would you know that you could sleep with somebody she wouldn't get immediately pregnant that was the only big difference there so yeah you know it's funny I'm thinking about Forrest Gump you know the if you if you've seen the film farce come Forrest Gump is about the idea that America has this essentially stupid decency that goes through all these changes in life and sort of past as far as come kind of represents an America that is stupid but also smart it's stupid but virtuous and this virtue is as smartness and and yet I can't help but thinking that Forrest Gump passes through that picture in some ways with his virtue unscathed but I'm not sure that is what happened to America anyway so Manson fell in with Dennis Wilson and the Beach Boys and the recorded some of the songs and all this and they and there was also a producer Terry Melcher but Meltzer refused to give Manson a record contract so Manson is now in California and he sets up this cult and what's fascinating about this cult okay is that it's largely white middle-class girls who come and become like his sex slaves and it's these girls who are some of them well brought up you know from or at least from nice homes who knows what they were had gone through but a lot of them it was the drugs you know you started taking I did anything good come out of that culture I remember being told oh man if you want to be a writer you have to LSD and I kept thinking like a head that doesn't it's not making sense to me you know if you ever want to be a writer your brain is all you got why would I take something's gonna turn it to glue and I never did I never did I smoked a little dope we all smoked dope but I I must have smoked up like five times and I thought like it's boring you know but like but everybody won it was pushing LSD on your mushrooms cocaine all that stuff and I just kind of stayed away from it but but like nothing good came out of so one of these women started and they started taking drugs they started taking hallucinogens and and Manson manipulated them and he would have sex with all of them and he would tell them who they could have sex with and he would tell them when they could have sex and he developed this cult that was largely based on these white middle-class women here is one of them van van Leslie Van Houten Van Houten was one of the murderers in the in the taped LaBianca murders that are the big murders that Manson was put away for but she has received parole pending I think Jerry Brown's approval I don't think she's gotten out yet but here she is explaining to the parole board this an actual tape of her parole hearing now and she's much older now right this is many many years of 69 when the murders were committed so we're talking like almost 40 years later more than 40 years later he or she is telling the parole board how she felt about Manson at the time I believe that because I believe that Manson was Jesus Christ and that it was something that had to be done and that follow is not something that I felt good about or the it was like war and we were going through combat training at the ranch and nothing perhaps like that a new belief system led you to believe that someone who was Jesus Christ would instigate racial wars between blacks and whites yeah he said that it was the blacks turn that the white had been on top for too long and all they ever did was put harm on other people that were not like them and that the last time he came he had been crucified and this time he would have to make himself known so Henson was Jesus Christ he was bringing about a race war for the sake of the blacks the blacks had been oppressed so he what he had this crazy idea called it helter skelter based on the Beatles song and the race war was going to be called helter skelter and that he had some idea that these murders were going to start this race war which would then elevate black people and he would be their their savior I can't help but be fascinated with the fact that women were taken in by this guy and we're attracted to this guy and we all know that when some of these sex killers and serial killers who go to prison they get fan mail and love letters from women there's something about them that that women find obviously not all women some women find appealing and this guy used that and just I just want to play a little bit of this interview with Manson because when I look at Manson I see like a street person I see like a guy I mean just an absolute psychopath he's nothing he says makes sense I picked this little cut because it's where the interviewer asks him if he has any remorse for the terrible terrible things he did and this is what he said from your words as mr. Evans quotes him in this book it's clear that you were guilty of murder and yet he says in all his conversations with you he never heard you express remorse have you never felt it remorse for what you people have done everything in the world to me doesn't that give me equal right I could do anything I want to you people at any time I want to because that's what you've done to me if you spit in my face and smack me in the mouth and throw me in solitary confinement for nothing thinks gonna happen when I get out of here guilty hmm I wouldn't do anything that I felt guilty about you don't feel guilty at all there's no need to feel guilty I haven't done anything I'm ashamed of maybe I haven't done enough I might be ashamed of that for not doing enough for not giving enough for not being more perceptive for not being aware enough for not understanding for be stupid maybe I should have killed for 500 people then I would have felt better I'm gonna felt like a really offered society something so I look at a guy like that and I just see you know I mean I just a guy who's ranting and raving obviously should be in prison forever I mean the only reason he got off without the death penalty's of the Supreme Court ruled that the death penalty was was illegal in California and so he didn't get the death penalty you spend his life but he keep kept coming up for parole with his swastikas like carved into his forehead so you know I mean at least we can have enough faith in the system that he was kept in prison his whole life but but there is something about this there's something about the fact that this was magnetic to people and that people went for this you know the the people who surrounded him he became a cult figure to this people there was a woman who just about two years ago said she was gonna marry him in prison a beautiful beautiful 25 year old now I should say before I play this clip of her I should say that there is some talk that it was all a con that she was just trying to get possession of his body so she could use his body as a museum piece or himself you know tickets a lot look at his body or something like this but here is she has been asked Ashton you know I don't meet the lation laughs but I mean it is just the depravity of humanity is quite amazing her name was Ashton Burton and Manson called her star and she's asked why she is marrying this guy well because I love him and I've somehow I've got half a brain that I can see that he is the one that knows what's going on he's the one that that is in the truth whenever nobody else is and what is it about him compared to other people you've met in your lifetime that makes him so unique and different Charlie always tells the truth no matter what so I'm talking about this as a crime rate or a crime novelist which is what I am I've been what I've been most of my life I'm even another Kingdom even though it's a fantasy story that is a crime story too I'm talking about what this story means and what kind of vision it presents and I'm gonna get back to that in a minute but first let's talk about sleeping now when I talk about sleeping it's always theoretical because I haven't slept for 20 years wait I'm awake so much I mean I really I just was thinking about this the other day I like I don't live an ordinary life I I woke up this morning at 5:00 because I had to do an interview usually

twenty bucks you get a whole year plus you get the leftist tiers tumbler which magically fills up every time I speak so let me just I want to wrap this up and I just talked about why I'm talking about it when all the sex stuff is coming up all these sex acts musicians what happened was Manson finally decided to the the people in his cult would do anything he told them to do and a lot of people don't know this he wasn't not the murders he wasn't at the murders he just commanded them to commit the murders and he sent his minions out like winged monkeys and they did commit the murders and this record producer Terry Melcher that he had known had refused to give him a record contract and so he was angry at him so he sent his minions to Terry Melcher's house even though he knew that Meltzer no longer lived there he knew they didn't live there who did live there was this very beautiful actress named Sharon Tate she was a b-movie actress she was married to a budding director Roman Lansky and the only thing that has ever in any way mitigated in my mind the fact that Roman Polanski drugged and raped a little girl has been this trauma in his life I mean I think this would have done it to anybody I this is a little grim but I really have to tell you because I think it's an important part of the story but you know let's take a quick look at Sharon Tate I mean you can see exactly what kind of actresses this valley of the dolls it was a soft core there was no nudity in it in those days but it was kind of a soft core sexy story by Jacqueline Susann who was a soft core sexy novelist and here's just a scene with Sharon Tate in it yes I'll accept the call hello mother well I just kidding I thought it was today to call you but I just sent you $50 last week mother okay I'll send you $50 as soon as I get my paycheck you told me Gran's been sick mother and I know about the oil burner okay I'll take the mink danke wires again he'll give me a couple hundred for it mother I know I don't have any talent and I know all I have is a body and I am doing my best exercises goodbye mother I'll wire you the money first thing in the morning goodbye how to hell with him huh so that's a very pomo scene because she obviously doesn't have any talent and she does have this body and she's dressed with it you know so you can see as much of it is as was at that time possible but here's the thing and this is gruesome but I talking about because it is part of the meaning of all is that she was eight-and-a-half months pregnant and when these guys burst in with this insane mission to kill everybody in the room they killed eight people if you include the kilts six people one night and two people the next night in another house but it's eight people altogether if you include the unborn child she was eight and a half months pregnant she pleaded with them to let her live just long enough to have the baby to deliver the baby and that their some of the story is that when she died she was still trying to explain to him that she was going to be a mother that she shouldn't kill them all right so really terrible but but it speaks to something to where we are right now because this dream this dream of sexual liberation which has been with us forever doesn't take into account as feminism doesn't take into account as most commentary doesn't take into account how deep and human and dangerous and exciting and creative the sexual impulse is the sexual impulses that are the heart of our physical humanity and it is a vortex of both creation and destruction and one of the things that drives me crazy when we're talking about the sexuality is people expect everything to go fairly everything to go nicely everyone to behave politely that's never happened in all of human history and so when some visionary clown or group of visionary clowns comes along and tells you that we're gonna take the shackles off we're gonna take the shackles off we're gonna get rid of these norms like marriage and all these imprisoning structures that people have built it's like it's like getting rid of a wall before you know what's on the other side of the wall you know it's like what do I need this shark cage for I need this protective structure for this protective structure that we were so quick to throw away and it was so desperately throw away because it feels like our humanity is being shackled was built for a reason and when they came along in the sixties and told us that was gonna be the Age of Aquarius now everyone's gonna sleep together and everyone's gonna be fine and it's gonna be free love baby you know we're all it's all gonna be Woodstock all the time Charles Manson was created in that moment Charles Manson was created by people with their dreams of utopian humanity with their dreams of an Age of Aquarius Charles Manson was the Age of Aquarius he was the Age of Aquarius the way it really looks because that's that's what happens when you let people free our souls our bodies are machines built to do things that our mind and souls know that they shouldn't always be doing and we have built these structures to protect ourselves from the vortex of our own brokenness and sin and you know it's just so so when me and and the women and the women flock to him the women who flock to him are also behaving in a way that is is natural to them you know I mean this is also part of our humanity so when I see all these people being accused of things and how we're gonna handle this and how it's all going to change it's not going to change it's not gonna change and and we've reached this point now with all this sexual malfeasance we've reached this point where it really is all about our political points of view people are saying well yeah well throw Clinton under the bus because we don't need him anymore what about Al Franken no no no we don't nod when I throw Al Franken we need that vote but what about Roy Moore you know he was banging on the on the Ten Commandments and aren't we gonna not support him if it's true that he was messing around with a fourteen-year-old no no no we got to support ruin more because we hate the other side so much all I can say is that you can't we can't live where only one side is following the rules right we can't live where Clinton gets off and and Roy Moore has to be penalized so it's not gonna work I know a lot of people are saying oh this is terrible the Conservatives are giving up their morals the left has already given up their morals but look this is a political fight we can't live where both we're only one side follows the rules I think that we're gonna have to start thinking really about what the rules are and in order to do that we have to stop get rid of why's we have to stop but you can't regulate a society through lies we can't tell ourselves that men and women are the same we can't tell ourselves they have the same proclivities we can't tell ourselves they have the same vision of life we can't tell ourselves they have the same sexuality we can't tell ourselves that you can magically become a woman by wishing it so or having pieces of your body cut off you can't it can't be done and until we look at ourselves truthfully until we look at ourselves freely we have no idea what the rule should be anymore we do not know what the rule should be anymore and all I'm telling you is that the structures that were put in place we may need new structures they may have to be modernized but the structures that were put in place were put in place because underneath it all is Manson and his followers that is that's what's waiting there it is not paradise it is not sexual you know love and peace and Woodstock forever that's what it is that's who that's who Charlie Manson was all right we got Knowles the star of another Kingdom not to mention the Michael Moore show come on it is pretty cool we get a bunch of tweets over the weekend it was a tough one for Charles Manson he didn't listen but you know obviously the new episode came out a lot of people listened to it and you can get it on stitcher Google Play or iTunes wherever fine narrative podcasts from the right-wing conspiracy are downloaded I saw I looked at it and it had 700 over 700 five-star reviews this was the shocking point yes I do like the one that Hillary Clinton gave us that said I don't like Michael Knowles get him out of there you know that's fine Hillary is entitled to her free speech even though she wanted to curtail our free speech she's entitled to her own no the reviews have been great and reviews for even you have been have been great of course they don't know you personally or they wouldn't be did you know people keep saying are you putting up the reviews and I thought I don't know anybody would say it's anything nice of that if it were Dru right like sweet little Elise or somebody it all be like three stars you know five for you one for me anyway it's been it's been a tremendous success and it's been just a joy doing it so like the really nice thing about it is that it means that it means two things one conservatives aren't Philistines when it comes yes it's possible is great yeah and the other is that conservatives can produce art that Hollywood can they can keep the gates closed they can keep the blacklist they can keep conservatives out but we can still make art that will be listened to by 20,000 30,000 people per episode you know one of the reasons I keep pleading with my audience and your audience to sign up for this thing to subscribe is because if we get enough success with it I will push the I swear I will push this down Ally which throat I will force them to make it but I need I need a lot of support a lot of more you know audience and then like I'll just cram it down it would be for a year its target we're at Thanksgiving I have a lot to be thankful for this year that's very nice year to me and to begin the year by shoving a blank book mocking Democrats down New York Publishing's throat yes and then to end the year by shoving a conservative written by conservatives a non politically correct fantasy down Hollywood's throat it would be the perfect bookend we got to do it we got to make it happy have a parade all right let's talk about your show comes on after wine you will be talking about Thanksgiving at length but I want to give people a preview because one of the thing I've been wondering about there all these myths about Thanksgiving and every year Rush Limbaugh tells the story about how it was to celebrate the end of communism or something like this I've always wondered is there any truth to this is that is that a true story I mean I know Rush everything you watch says is true it is by the very fact of it comes true when he says he yes I wondered this too obviously I repeated the story blindly for years without really looking into it but I've wondered too is that is that the true story so I looked into it and the short answer is yes it is true the left has tried to attack this version of the story they point out that the first Thanksgiving that we think of as Thanksgiving was in 1621 one year after the pilgrims sailed and you know the Indians came and there were a lot of Indians who showed up that they everybody ate turkey and duck and goose and the Indians brought some deer that they had just killed and they had a nice time but this was just a regular Harvest Festival it happened around this time of year late September early October it was a regular Harvest Festival they had these in England and in many ways this wasn't a thanks for the abundance that they've gotten from their harvest it was the last meal of a condemned man this winter was going to be brutal gah they didn't have enough food to live and it ended up being a very difficult winter it became a very difficult winter for a few reasons one of which is that the pilgrims tried communism they when they got there and that's not an exaggeration by the way I was reading William Bradford governor Bradford's of Plymouth Plantation last night the definitive account of the Plymouth era written by the governor of the colony and he talks at length about the communal plan the common course a frequently referred to as communism and he says quote at length after much debate of things the governor gave way that they should set corn every man for his own particular and in that regard Trust to themselves in all other things they would do it as they did before but instead of dividing up the land for everybody they would give each man his own parcel of land that he had to work they had this problem where a lot of people were saying I'm sick I'm tired I'm coming down with under some you mean they people wouldn't work they wouldn't work they was they wouldn't work the fields people started to get a little angry so so Bradford writes this had very good success for it made all hands very industrious so as much more corn was planted than otherwise would have been by any means the governor or any other could use and saved him a great deal of trouble and gave far better consent the women now willingly went into the field and took their little ones with them to set corn which before would allege weakness and inability they'd say they didn't want to go out and he Bradford so as we don't miss the point so he's nothing he's talk about someone else he gets very explicit he says the experience that was had in this common course and condition tried sundry years and that amongst godly and sober men may well events the vanity of that conceit of Plato's and other ancients applauded by some of later times applauded by choral marks of even later times Bradford is writing yeah that the taking away of property and bringing in community into a Commonwealth would make them happy and flourishing as if they were wiser than God oh wow even talks about how you know the bread discontent everywhere because you'd have a few women left in the colony and they would be forced to do all the work for all of the men and for men's wives to be commanded to do service for other men as dressing their meat washing their clothes etc they deemed it a kind of slavery neither could many husbands well Brooke it so the husbands didn't like their wives being used either and I take special interest in this because I'm descended from four of these people you are so yeah believe it or not I know it looks worthy in Sicilian yeah but I also descended from one pilgrim a guy named dr. Samuel fuller the doctor of the colony and three of the strangers so they were not separatists they were not religious zealots they just wanted to come and have a new life and make a little bit of money and those those guys were Stephen Hopkins who had earlier been on a shipwreck in Bermuda which is what Shakespeare's The Tempest is based on yeah yeah he was a mutineer yeah you're related to one of the guys that they based the temperature lab at but he was a mutineer and he caused a lot of trouble on the Mayflower then this there was another guy Francis Eaton he was fine and then John Billington who Bradford said was one of the most profane esteem and he'd ever met that was the direct line and I think he was thrown into the stalks a number of times almost killed yeah so that that's the the group that we come from okay so they did try they did try communism and find it didn't work so they said it didn't work and and to Russia's point yeah this was the first time it was called Thanksgiving okay there was a second gunman from governor Bradford that said we will celebrate Thanksgiving which was really I suppose the third Thanksgiving was the third year in 1623 rush as always absolutely right and there you know there's so much disinformation about Thanksgiving I'm gonna go into it I'm gonna do a full show on it on Wednesday and and will air it Thursday - okay but there's there's this idea that we came here the the Indians were very nice to us they gave us corn they were all United they were just just charitable taught us how to eat and then we just butchered all of them that was our thank you to them and it really it's so paternalistic it's so condescending - first of all it's anti historical to say that these were United tribes they were weren't United for more than 30 mile stretches right and but it's so condescending to say that they were all peaceful and naive there was nothing naive about these people they dealt with Europeans a little bit before and especially that they'd massacred some French and some Englishmen and they were smart though and they were relatively sophisticated statesmen and so they used the arrival of the English to get an advantage over one tribe or to consolidate power in this area and the English used them to some advantage - it was so there were people there were people there were people there were political actors who went to war and were diplomatic and gave each other considerable respect and the you know the real story is just much more complicated than the the ridiculous left-wing narrative about it and by the way there was a relative peace for well over 50 years right there was a relative peace for a long time until poor decisions were made particularly by the child of NASA so 'it who was our ally and who benefited greatly from the english in english benefited greatly from him he this indian made a bad calculation and it didn't work ever well for his drive but this piece and ORD for half of the century is it true that when the when the pilgrims arrived they found an indian who spoke english talk about the divine and robbery has always struck me as a divine problem it's really bizarre it's but it's even more bizarre than you think it is so they were aiming for new york for the mouth of the Hudson River they get blown way off course and the master of the ship knew they were blown off course but they weren't blown off course enough to end up at Boston Harbor they weren't blown off course enough to end up at a nice Harbor they ended up off of Cape Cod they get off the boat and some Indians start to attack them base the police have found huge stores of corn just right where they're just beautiful stores of corn where they were and not a lot of people but they end up getting attacked they go a little bit further end up at Plymouth the thing they notice is that the fields are completely clear they're totally clear they're ready for agriculture but all they find are the whitened bones of the dead excuse me because a plague had wiped out virtually the entire tribes of this area just within the previous two years so the land is cleared for them all is peaceful all is nice they're waiting for the sad little skirmish with the Indians they then see one Indian boldly walk toward them alone they get their muskets ready they don't know what to do he just keeps walking toward them and he says two words welcome Englishman his name is Samoset possibly Somerset the in English version he happened to be visiting from Maine where he had run into a couple of English fishermen in a couple years previously so he's he was just visiting the rest of the tribe did not speak English but then out comes Squanto who was a prisoner of the chief massa so it Squanto had been taken by John Smith the English explorer brought to Spain escaped somehow it might have been smuggled out by monks ends up in London then makes it back on another ship to the new world ends up exactly where the pilgrims land accidentally lands accidentally land not at the place they wanted to not at the place they should have but exactly where they do land and he comes out and speaks basically perfect English to them and converses talks to them about Spain talks to them about various neighborhoods in London and and and also then uses them to for his own political machinations but though basically the one guy in the hemisphere that speaks fluent English ends up exactly where the pilgrims accidentally land unbelievable it is an unbelievable story Michael Knowles the Michael mole show is coming up after this it's always good talking to you know as well talk to you soon you know I was in church this Sunday the reading was the parable of the talents and if you don't know the parable it sounds where we get the word talent a talent was a block of silver and black yeah a block of silver and is it so a parable about a guy who gives each of his servants a certain number of talents when he gives one talent when he gives to when he gives five I don't know I can't remember it and he goes away and when he comes back one of them has invested his five talents and made five more and he says well done you know you've done a great job and the others invested his two talents and made two more he says great good job you did what you could with what you had and the guy with one talent was so afraid of losing it he buried it in the ground and the master who kind of represents God in the story says that's that was the wrong thing to do you know I want and you could have at least invested it and given me interest on this and I was thinking gee God is a capitalist you know he says he's obviously a capital so when they tried communism said we thought were wiser than God they were actually right God as a capitalist invests in us to use our talents and that's like I said that's where you get the word talent as we use it he invests in us our talents he expects a return on his money he doesn't work for it he just gives us the dough just like any capitalist all right our crappy culture so so many years ago the a an exhibit came it came to New York I think he traveled all around the country and it was the tomb of Tutankhamen King Tutankhamun the Egyptian pharaoh child king and it became a huge huge smash so that they were selling t-shirts cuttin common King Tut you know King Tut was everywhere and you know how these cultural things take off sometimes and it just became this big big deal so Steve Martin and a hilarious absolutely hilarious Saturday Night Live routine came out and said this was to commercial and I'm going to sing a little song to bring us all back to our senses so here's just a minute of that routine I'd like to talk seriously just for a moment one of the great art exhibits ever to tour the United States is the treasures of Tutankhamen or King Tut but I think it's a national disgrace the way we have commercialized it with trinkets and toys t-shirts and posters and about three months ago I was up in the woods and I wrote a song I tried to use the ancient modalities and melodies I would like to do it for you right now maybe we can all learn something from this ain't modalities he says my favorite line is as long as later on where he says he's dancing on the Nile the ladies love his style anyway at Reed College a small liberal arts school I'm reading from News Buster's PJ gladdening and Reed College a small liberal arts school in Portland Oregon a 39 year old Saturday Night Live skit this one recently caused an uproar over cultural appropriation in the classic Steve Martin skit he performs a goofy song Kim cut meant to satirize a tuck in common exhibit during the US and to criticize the commercialization of Egyptian culture this is a guy writing in the Atlantic about this he says you could say that his critique is weak that his humor is lame his dance moves are unintentionally offensive or downright racist all of that and more was debated in a humanities course at Reid but many students found the video so egregious that they opposed his very presence in class says one student that's like somebody making a song just littered with the n-word everywhere this is a member of Reedy's against racism he told the student newspaper when asked about Martin's performance she said the Egyptian garb she told the Atlantic the Egyptian garb of the backup dancers and singers many of whom were African Americans is racist as well the gold face of the saxophone dancer leaving its tomb is an exhibition of blackface you know what gets me about identity politics though it struck me about this as I was reading this is identity politics they call themselves progressives but you ever noticed that everything progressives say is actually the opposite of the truth progressive is a demitasse six is going back to an old idea of tribalism identity part we were going past this and it isn't keeping with it's in keeping with the tattoos and the piercing and these women who go out in protests that they're not allowed to bare their breasts in public and all this stuff it's as if it's as if they want to return to a primitive state this is when I was in Afghanistan this is all the people in Afghanistan do is fight over things that happen 300 years ago your tribe member raped a woman in my tribe I'm going to kill you you know 400 years ago doesn't matter it's still alive today and this this identity politics is just a throwback to this the progressivism is progressing right back to primitivism basically as progressing right back into the past all right tomorrow we have a guest tomorrow don't oh yeah this is where the Scott Adams great interview got it listen to this absolutely great the Dilbert guy has also become a big really fascinating an original observer of Donald Trump and we had a really interesting talk be there for that I'm Andrew Clavin this is the Andrew Clavin show I'll see you tomorrow
