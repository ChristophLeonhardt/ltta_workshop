anything but so what<font color="#CCCCCC"> can we do as</font>

81
00:03:53,650 --> 00:03:55,330

00:03:55,330 --> 00:03:56,709
hopeless you know saying we're not

83
00:03:56,709 --> 00:03:59,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">professional activists we don't read</font>

89
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:14,560
revolutionary love and what<font color="#CCCCCC"> that means</font>

90
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:19,870
is you make a point to UM correct people

91
00:04:19,870 --> 00:04:21,850
I don't care if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you do it nicely or not</font>

92
00:04:21,850 --> 00:04:24,990
I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> know your style but</font>

93
00:04:24,990 --> 00:04:28,289
change the way people talk about black

94
00:04:28,289 --> 00:04:30,449
people so for me revolutionary love

95
00:04:30,449 --> 00:04:33,720
sometimes looks like me verbally<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

96
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:37,050
openly and publicly correcting an older

97
00:04:37,050 --> 00:04:40,650
African person an adult when they talk

98
00:04:40,650 --> 00:04:45,050
shady sideways about an african-american

99
00:04:45,050 --> 00:04:47,639
you all know<font color="#CCCCCC"> that my family is not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> from</font>

100
00:04:47,639 --> 00:04:51,360
the US and if you are also from an

101
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:54,389
African family but<font color="#E5E5E5"> you were born or</font>

102
00:04:54,389 --> 00:04:56,160
raised in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> US you know there</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is some</font>

103
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:59,240
like some clash between

104
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:02,659
african-americans and Africans from

105
00:05:02,659 --> 00:05:06,300
Africa closely in the generation you

106
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:08,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">know like immigrants basically i will</font>

107
00:05:08,370 --> 00:05:11,479
always correct you please do<font color="#E5E5E5"> not talk</font>

108
00:05:11,479 --> 00:05:14,900
sideways about my brothers and sisters

109
00:05:14,900 --> 00:05:18,090
do this<font color="#E5E5E5"> African American children or</font>

110
00:05:18,090 --> 00:05:21,120
they do is that<font color="#E5E5E5"> enough I will stop it's</font>

111
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:22,889
<font color="#E5E5E5">not okay what is that that's why I</font>

112
00:05:22,889 --> 00:05:25,289
supremacy that's them<font color="#CCCCCC"> you're black</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> also</font>

113
00:05:25,289 --> 00:05:30,810
feeding into that idea<font color="#CCCCCC"> that but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you're</font>

114
00:05:30,810 --> 00:05:33,419
lazy they only<font color="#CCCCCC"> care about looking good</font>

115
00:05:33,419 --> 00:05:34,969
<font color="#E5E5E5">they don't care about working hard</font>

116
00:05:34,969 --> 00:05:37,530
they're suspicious they are threat

117
00:05:37,530 --> 00:05:39,300
they're violent they always be in a

118
00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:42,539
crime etc etc that's them feeding into

119
00:05:42,539 --> 00:05:44,400
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> well I got</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to correct them and</font>

120
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:46,680
that's how I show my revolutionary love

121
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:49,860
so sometimes it's scary because you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font>

122
00:05:49,860 --> 00:05:51,659
you don't want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get thrashed by an</font>

123
00:05:51,659 --> 00:05:54,599
African grown up but um that's all I<font color="#E5E5E5"> can</font>

124
00:05:54,599 --> 00:05:56,370
do as a regular girl living in this

125
00:05:56,370 --> 00:05:59,669

00:05:59,669 --> 00:06:02,880
say whatever you want to say um and I'll

127
00:06:02,880 --> 00:00:00,000
read them<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay have a good day</font>
