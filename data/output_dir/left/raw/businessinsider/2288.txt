1
00:00:04,589 --> 00:00:07,359
first off tell us what anyclip is it's

2
00:00:07,359 --> 00:00:09,010
the byproduct of a dream that<font color="#CCCCCC"> made</font>

3
00:00:09,010 --> 00:00:11,139
westheimer and I had our my co-founder

4
00:00:11,139 --> 00:00:13,179
that you could see any moment from any

5
00:00:13,179 --> 00:00:15,730
film ever made and the way we came up

6
00:00:15,730 --> 00:00:17,110
with the idea is we noticed that<font color="#CCCCCC"> there</font>

7
00:00:17,110 --> 00:00:18,520
was a tremendous amount of this behavior

8
00:00:18,520 --> 00:00:20,410
already on the internet and a lot of

9
00:00:20,410 --> 00:00:22,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">that is on YouTube and it's hard to do</font>

10
00:00:22,750 --> 00:00:24,970
on YouTube so we<font color="#CCCCCC"> thought well if people</font>

11
00:00:24,970 --> 00:00:26,770
<font color="#CCCCCC">are doing it anyway and it's hard to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> do</font>

12
00:00:26,770 --> 00:00:28,869
maybe we could make a service that would

13
00:00:28,869 --> 00:00:30,969
make it<font color="#E5E5E5"> much easier to do Google's had a</font>

14
00:00:30,969 --> 00:00:33,070
really hard to enter the publishers so

15
00:00:33,070 --> 00:00:34,870
you can't have<font color="#CCCCCC"> that kind of bad</font>

16
00:00:34,870 --> 00:00:36,640
relationship how they did good release

17
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:39,340
yeah well<font color="#CCCCCC"> our I would say we've made a</font>

18
00:00:39,340 --> 00:00:41,110
decision<font color="#CCCCCC"> to talk to the people who own</font>

19
00:00:41,110 --> 00:00:44,020
the content first that's a slightly

20
00:00:44,020 --> 00:00:45,940
different sequencing<font color="#E5E5E5"> we don't quite</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font>

21
00:00:45,940 --> 00:00:48,370
Google's I guess we're not as well known

22
00:00:48,370 --> 00:00:50,470
as Google right on in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> process but</font>

23
00:00:50,470 --> 00:00:53,230
there's a set of<font color="#CCCCCC"> reasons why anyclip is</font>

24
00:00:53,230 --> 00:00:55,840
possible the first one is the<font color="#E5E5E5"> history of</font>

25
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:58,989
the movie industry<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a history of new</font>

26
00:00:58,989 --> 00:01:01,090
technologies coming along and generally

27
00:01:01,090 --> 00:01:03,520
doing one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> two things creating a new</font>

28
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:07,380
opportunity to repurpose the content and

29
00:01:07,380 --> 00:01:10,179
sometimes that leads to big new revenue

30
00:01:10,179 --> 00:01:12,100
streams is the case<font color="#CCCCCC"> of home video and</font>

31
00:01:12,100 --> 00:01:14,229
video on the DVD<font color="#E5E5E5"> business box office has</font>

32
00:01:14,229 --> 00:01:16,210
grown so<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's home video historically</font>

33
00:01:16,210 --> 00:01:17,609
and sometimes it leads to

34
00:01:17,609 --> 00:01:20,619
cannibalization as it has with<font color="#E5E5E5"> netflix</font>

35
00:01:20,619 --> 00:01:22,990
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> video on demand relative to those</font>

36
00:01:22,990 --> 00:01:26,139
very same<font color="#CCCCCC"> DVDs yeah so in our case</font>

37
00:01:26,139 --> 00:01:28,899
there's no cannibalization we show short

38
00:01:28,899 --> 00:01:31,810
moments from films and we're just

39
00:01:31,810 --> 00:01:33,700
additive the short moments lead to an

40
00:01:33,700 --> 00:01:35,799
opportunity to buy or rent those films

41
00:01:35,799 --> 00:01:37,869
and so that's something that's very

42
00:01:37,869 --> 00:01:39,609
important to the industry that's one

43
00:01:39,609 --> 00:01:41,020
thing and I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think the second one is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

44
00:01:41,020 --> 00:01:43,509
<font color="#E5E5E5">historical moment we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are at a big time</font>

45
00:01:43,509 --> 00:01:45,789
of transition last year was the first

46
00:01:45,789 --> 00:01:49,380
year theatrical surpassed home video in

47
00:01:49,380 --> 00:01:52,899
over 20 years amazing so home video

48
00:01:52,899 --> 00:01:55,270
revenues are declining and there's a big

49
00:01:55,270 --> 00:01:57,159
need for transition today<font color="#CCCCCC"> and need</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> all</font>

50
00:01:57,159 --> 00:01:59,709
<font color="#E5E5E5">the help they can get correct we're here</font>

51
00:01:59,709 --> 00:00:00,000
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> help</font>
