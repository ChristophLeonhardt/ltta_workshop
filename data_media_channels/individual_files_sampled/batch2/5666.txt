and now to an NBC News exclusive report and who may be responsible for the medical mystery that sickened 26 diplomats and intelligence officials all Americans in Cuba almost two years ago intelligence officials now believe Russia is the leading suspect and that was no accident according to three US officials and two others briefed on the investigation backing up their suspicions highly secret communication intercepts joining me now to experts Devon Zarate former deputy national security adviser to President George HW Bush and MSNBC senior national security analyst and NBC's national political reporter Josh Lederman who did a lot of this reporting Josh you and the team have been working on this for quite a long time I was down in Havana last October talking to intelligence officials there there have been suspicions all along but you really honed in on Russia being the prime suspect according to these officials no evidence no proof no ability to accuse Russia diplomatically but they are the real suspects that's right Russia had been a suspicion from the start due to their large presence on the island of Cuba their advanced military capabilities and as you first reported from Havana even the Cubans had acknowledged that was a possibility but now Andrea this is really more than a theory this is the main suspect and it's backed up with at least some information from some communications intercepts known as signals intelligence that officials tell NBC News that the US government has developed but injury it's not yet conclusive enough for the u.s. to take what would be a very dramatic step of formally accusing Russia of being behind these attacks so the United States will continue to develop evidence try to hunt this down both who was behind it and exactly what the technology was used that has affected these diplomats in Josh and Juan I talked to former Secretary John Kerry about this yesterday as to how Russia would be involved and this is what he had to say just been there the whole time Andrea that's not new that Russia is in Cuba or involved with Cuba Russia has been a lifeline for them in many ways the entire period of time so that is not going to change either and when he said is that Russia is there but what's happened one is that - first of all safeguard our people they were pulled back but it also fit let's say coincidentally or conveniently with the Trump administration's desire to change the Obama opening to Cuba and to basically shut down relations and that's what's happened and that we've left the field to Russia so Russia is now all over the island in terms of intelligence gathering and the u.s. is basically without any real weapons yeah I think the reality Andrea is that the Cold War never ended for many in the Cuban government as well as parts of the Russian government including President Putin and I think the Russians have never really left Cuba and they've sent signals to the United States that they were not going to be absent not just from Cuba but also Venezuela in the region and this also comes at a time when Russia is much more aggressive acting with impunity around the world you have the nerve agent attacks in London you have the cyber attacks on our electoral system on systems in Eastern Europe you have provocative military exercises happening now as we speak the largest in recent modern memory in eastern Russia and so this is a another demonstration if it proves to be right if Josh's reporting is correct that the Russians have taken yet another step to use asymmetric attacks to affect US interests whether it's sonic weapons electromagnetic weapons microwave weapons whatever you have you have the u.s. now having to confront yet another vector of attack from the Russians and one other thing that comes out of our new reporting is that this is not an accident this is not a microwave listening device gone bad this is an attack yeah against American diplomats and intelligence officers and it was targeting them absolutely I think they're number of factors you look at Andrea as you know any investigator or intelligence officer would look at one you have the the number of attacks so this happened in 2016 it also began to recur in 2018 and so this isn't just random this also isn't just part of some rogue operation we have indications it may have happened in China as well you have the number of officials targeted the facilities that are targeted diplomatic facilities intelligence officials and so this is not an accident and those who who think this is some sort of rogue operation I think are operating in a fantasy world this is targeted this is led by a sophisticated likely state actor and if josh is reporting is right all roads lead back to Moscow on this and Josh one of the things that you and I both seen in covering Cuba for these years and the US diplomacy or lack of it is that after that opening there may well have been some hardliners and even secretary Tillerson was saying basically we're not blaming Cuba but that Cuba being the kind of government it is must have known and so they could have had some help it could have been an inside job from some people in Havana we're not happy with the Obama role Castro opening that's right Andrea officials who have been working on this investigation for the last year plus now tell us that they still don't think it would be possible for Russia to carry this out entirely on its own without at least some cooperation or some tacit consent from the Cuban government given the fact that it's a small island they have their own heavy surveillance on the island and the fact that you know this would have to have been pretty really with the knowledge of the Cuban government for it to take place in hotels such as Hotel Nacional essentially run by the Cuban government and other facilities like that Cuba has denied it Russia hasn't commented overnight one quick question one where were you on 9/11 I was in the Treasury Department in the fourth floor looking south over the Potomac River watching the smoke rise from the Pentagon we were watching what was happening in New York on the TV and we were evacuated from the Treasury Department we raced there's a core group of us race to the Secret Service headquarters and frankly we're watching the sky praying to God that another plane wasn't heading toward the Capitol or toward the White House and as we later learned of course one would have been had it not been for the heroism of the crew and passengers on the flight nine of 93 thank you so much thank you Andrea thank you one Thank You Josh hey there I'm Chris Hayes from MSNBC thanks for watching MSNBC on YouTube if you want to keep up to date with the videos we're putting out you can click Subscribe just below me or click over on this list to see lots of other great videos
