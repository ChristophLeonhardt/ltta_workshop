have very very special people you were
here long before any of us were here
although we have a representative in
Congress who they say was here a long
time ago
they call her Pocahontas but you know
what I like you because you are special
you are special people you are really
incredible people and I have from the
heart from the absolute heart we
appreciate what you've done how you've
done it the bravery that you displayed
and the love that you have for your
country Tom I would say that's as as
good as it gets wouldn't you say
