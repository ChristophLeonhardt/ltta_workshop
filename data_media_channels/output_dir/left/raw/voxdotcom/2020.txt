1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,540
The problem with calling Trump a...

2
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:04,019
is that we have a really

3
00:00:04,019 --> 00:00:08,940
narrow idea of what it looks like when
democracies fail. We imagine democratic

4
00:00:08,940 --> 00:00:14,490
failure as being some spectacular event
a military coup or an illegal power grab

5
00:00:14,490 --> 00:00:16,620
or the declaration of martial law.

6
00:00:16,620 --> 00:00:18,740
To protect the Republic of the Philippines

7
00:00:18,740 --> 00:00:19,840
and our democracy.

8
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:22,300
We don't really
imagine it looking like this.

9
00:00:23,020 --> 00:00:24,900
This is a child's desk, but that's okay.

10
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:26,580
It's the smallest desk I've ever seen.

11
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:30,920
But political scientists do, because in a
country like the US, the death of

12
00:00:30,929 --> 00:00:34,440
democracy is going to start off looking
kind of normal.

13
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:36,059
So normal, you might not

14
00:00:36,059 --> 00:00:38,420
even notice it's happening until it's
too late.

15
00:00:38,420 --> 00:00:39,960
Well I respect the group but

16
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:43,760
the entire thing has been a witch hunt and
there is no collusion.

17
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:46,289
Trump's firing of former FBI

18
00:00:46,289 --> 00:00:50,550
director James Comey has gotten a lot of
media attention, in part because it's

19
00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:53,120
really easy to explain why it matters.

20
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:54,690
If Trump fired Comey over the Russia

21
00:00:54,690 --> 00:00:58,320
investigation that would be obstruction
of justice, which is a crime but a lot of

22
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:02,219
what worries political scientists about
Trump is tougher to explain in a

23
00:01:02,219 --> 00:01:06,119
soundbite like that. Because for the most
part it's stuff that's totally legal.

24
00:01:06,119 --> 00:01:11,820
It turns out that government officials can
exploit weaknesses in the law in ways

25
00:01:11,820 --> 00:01:15,880
that are destructive to the rule of law as
a whole.

26
00:01:15,880 --> 00:01:18,240
This bearer of bad news is Aziz Huq.

27
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:21,240
He's a law professor at the
University of Chicago and he's written a

28
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:24,040
lot about a concept called "democratic
backsliding",

29
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:24,750
which kind of sounds like

30
00:01:24,750 --> 00:01:26,580
something Hillary Clinton does at a
wedding.

31
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:30,900
Backsliding is what happens when

32
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:35,009
a democratically elected government,
starts attacking the institutions that

33
00:01:35,009 --> 00:01:36,200
make democracy work.

34
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:37,800
I know the dance
thing was cooler.

35
00:01:38,780 --> 00:01:39,560
And Huck argues that

36
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:44,040
what makes backsliding so dangerous is
that it's really hard to know when it starts.

37
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:48,360
In many other countries the way
that we see democratic backsliding

38
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:53,100
happening is through a series of
discrete legal changes, each of which is

39
00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:55,820
on their own completely lawful.

40
00:01:55,820 --> 00:01:57,840
A great
example of what backsliding looks like

41
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:00,500
is Venezuela's former President Hugo
Chavez.

42
00:02:03,220 --> 00:02:04,120
Ah, the 90s.

43
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:08,280
Chavez was elected as a
democratic populist, but over time he

44
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:08,900
changed.

45
00:02:08,900 --> 00:02:12,620
And while remaining popular Chavez
has been anything but democratic.

46
00:02:12,620 --> 00:02:17,160
He got frustrated with opposition from courts
and the media, so he started doing things

47
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:22,260
like firing judges, using anti-defamation
laws to silence journalists, and even

48
00:02:22,260 --> 00:02:26,200
describing unfriendly news organizations
as quote "enemies of the homeland".

49
00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:35,180
What's scary about Chavez's story,

50
00:02:35,180 --> 00:02:39,320
is that he didn't need a military coup
to screw up Venezuela's democracy.

51
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:44,440
The man who came to office by democracy, he's
doing everything he can just snuff it out.

52
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:48,690
He did it legally, by slowly turning
his supporters and political allies

53
00:02:48,690 --> 00:02:51,420
against the country's democratic
institutions.

54
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:05,900
Autocrats in other parts of the world
have gone after those institutions very

55
00:03:05,910 --> 00:03:08,360
early on in the process of backsliding.

56
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:10,110
And that's what worries political

57
00:03:10,110 --> 00:03:11,420
scientists about Trump.

58
00:03:11,420 --> 00:03:14,910
Trump shows a
deep distrust of America's democratic

59
00:03:14,910 --> 00:03:18,840
institutions. He lashes out at judges,
calls journalists, the enemy of the

60
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:22,600
people, accuses watchdog agencies of
conspiring against him.

61
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:23,549
He questions the

62
00:03:23,549 --> 00:03:25,700
legitimacy of an election that he won.

63
00:03:25,700 --> 00:03:27,959
His White House stonewalls reporters to

64
00:03:27,959 --> 00:03:29,240
avoid answering questions.

65
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:33,120
Off. It's off-camera. Off. It's off.

66
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:35,420
He's suspicious of the mechanisms that

67
00:03:35,430 --> 00:03:36,460
limit his authority.

68
00:03:36,460 --> 00:03:41,160
This is an unprecedented judicial overreach.

69
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:41,700
And he

70
00:03:41,700 --> 00:03:43,460
encourages his supporters to be too.

71
00:03:43,460 --> 00:03:47,790
that is a catastrophic thing to be happening

72
00:03:47,790 --> 00:03:52,560
in a democracy. It's how democratic backsliding starts, but the thing is none of

73
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:53,680
this is illegal.

74
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:56,549
As long as Republicans
in Congress go along with it, there's

75
00:03:56,549 --> 00:03:59,790
nothing to stop Trump from publicly
criticizing basic democratic

76
00:03:59,790 --> 00:04:01,000
institutions.

77
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,450
Our Constitution just
doesn't do a very good job of protecting

78
00:04:03,450 --> 00:04:07,160
us against certain
kinds of democratic failure.

79
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:08,430
Whether you're in a

80
00:04:08,430 --> 00:04:13,560
moment of democratic backsliding really
depends upon the character of our

81
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:14,800
political leaders.

82
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:17,728
Which brings us back
to Comey and why it's so hard to talk

83
00:04:17,728 --> 00:04:20,759
about Democratic backsliding without
sounding paranoid.

84
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:21,570
We live in a media

85
00:04:21,570 --> 00:04:25,440
environment that is really bad at
putting things in context, that is

86
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:29,430
designed to bombard us with breaking
news and discrete pieces of information

87
00:04:29,430 --> 00:04:33,389
and that makes it hard to identify
democratic backsliding when it starts.

88
00:04:33,389 --> 00:04:37,680
Because unless it clearly breaks the law,
it's really tough to explain why any one

89
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:41,070
Trump tweet or scandal poses a threat to
democracy.

90
00:04:41,070 --> 00:04:45,599
Wo when Trump calls a federal judge a "so
called judge", it's just a one-off comment.

91
00:04:45,599 --> 00:04:49,440
Does anyone honestly believe President
Trump is going to ignore this judge's

92
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:51,680
order because he's a quote so-called judge?

93
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:53,400
When Trump calls the press the enemy of

94
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:55,620
the American people, it's all talk.

95
00:04:55,620 --> 00:04:57,389
He sounds like a broken record it's just

96
00:04:57,389 --> 00:04:59,200
kind of like what else you got Donald Trump?

97
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:02,130
I don't think that new media are well designed

98
00:05:02,130 --> 00:05:07,800
to tell this kind of story, because those
media are designed to convey

99
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:09,800
information in very small chunks.

100
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:12,150
The real story is not the discrete action in

101
00:05:12,150 --> 00:05:15,020
a particular moment in time, there's some
bigger picture.

102
00:05:15,020 --> 00:05:16,349
Democratic backsliding is one

103
00:05:16,349 --> 00:05:19,400
of those things that you can't really
see from up close.

104
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:20,310
It is only when you

105
00:05:20,310 --> 00:05:25,530
when you look at changes in the
aggregate that one sees the effect

106
00:05:25,530 --> 00:05:29,760
upon democracy after, a set of
institutions and practices.

107
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:31,860
That doesn't mean the Comey stuff isn't important.

108
00:05:31,860 --> 00:05:33,630
Obstruction of justice is obviously a

109
00:05:33,630 --> 00:05:38,070
big deal. But some of the biggest threats
to democracy are way less dramatic, way

110
00:05:38,070 --> 00:05:39,760
more normal looking.

111
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:42,389
And if you're
waiting for the CNN chyron announcing

112
00:05:42,389 --> 00:05:43,680
that it's time to panic,

113
00:05:43,680 --> 00:00:00,000
you're going to be waiting for a long time.
