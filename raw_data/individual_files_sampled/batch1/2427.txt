why is it refreshes or make false statements well look I don't know that that is a false statement Georgia neither do you why is it responsible to make it well I think I think the president-elect just wants a call to call to attention the fact that that that there has been evidence over over many years of it's not bad and and and expressing that reality the Pew Research Center found evidence of that four years ago it certainly certainly his right but you know it's his right to make false statements well it's it's his right to express his opinion as a president like to the United States I think one of the things that's refreshing about our president-elect and the it's one of the reasons why I think he made such an incredible connection with people all across this country is because he he tells you what's on his mind but why make false statements well look I don't know that that is a false statement Georgia neither to you the simple fact is that there there's no evidence there is there is evidence historic evidence from the Pew Research Center of voter fraud that's taken place we're in the process of investigating irregularities in the state of Indiana that we're leading up to this election that's the fact that voter fraud exists is but you can say they said and as a facts in this country we provide any a votes to back up that state well look I think he's expressed his opinion on that he's worried he's entitled to express his opinion on that and I think the American people I think the American people find it very refreshing that they have a a president who will tell them what's on his mind and I I think I think the connection that he made in the course whether it's true or not collective that they're gonna tell him what he's gonna say what he believes to be true and I and I and I know that he's always going to speak speak in that way as president
