WELCOME BACK.
THE BATTLE OVER BRETT
KAVANAUGH CONFIRMATION HAS
DIVIDED THE U.S.
I SHOULD NEVER SAY POLITICAL
OPPONENTS SHOULD ROT IN HELL
OR WHATEVER THE PHRASE WAS BUT
IT IS HARD TO MAINTAIN
STABILITY IN THE WAY THAT THE
DEMOCRATIC PARTY HAS BEHAVED
IN THIS.
JOINING US NOW, HE HAS A
BRILLIANT BOOK OUT LATER WHICH
WE WILL BE TALKING ABOUT, BUT
I WOULD LOVE YOUR TAKE ON ALL
THIS BECAUSE YOU'RE SUCH AN
INTERESTING COMMENTATOR.
WHERE YOU THINK THIS LEAVES
US, THIS WHOLE LAST FEW WEEKS
TWO I THINK IT LEAVES US
BROAD, ANGRY AND MORE DIVIDED
THAN EVER.
ONE OF THE IRONY OF THE STORY,
SOMETHING WE HAVEN'T HEARD
MUCH TALK ABOUT IS THAT BRETT
KAVANAUGH IS A CONSERVATIVE
WHO FLOURISHED IN LIBERAL
INSTITUTIONS AT YALE, AT YELL
LAW SCHOOL, HE IS SOMEONE WHO
HAD NUMEROUS DEMOCRATS COME
OUT AND DEFEND HIM EARLY ON
THIS PROCESS.
HE ROUTINELY HIRED LIBERAL
STUDENTS WHO PRAISE HIM AND
WORKED TO SUPPORT HIS
NOMINATION TO THE SUPREME
COURT.
HE IS VERY MUCH AN
ESTABLISHMENT CONSERVATIVE,
SOMEONE WHO IS ALWAYS WORKING
ACROSS THE AISLE, TRYING TO
BUILD BRIDGES.
HIS PHILOSOPHY IS BASED ON THE
IDEA THAT WE MUST ALLOW
DEMOCRATIC LEGISLATORS TO TAKE
THE LEAD.
FRED WHAT DID HE GET?
HE WAS TRYING TO BUILD BRIDGES
AND DOING SO MUCH.
HE WAS LITERALLY HIRED AS A
LECTURER BY ELENA KAGAN,
ANOTHER SUPREME COURT
JUSTICE.
SHE HIRED HIM AND WENT OUT OF
HER WAY BECAUSE SHE SO
RESPECTED HIM AS A JOURNALIST
AND A THINKER.
THEN SUDDENLY SOMEONE WHO
DEVOTED SO MUCH OF HIS LIFE TO
BUILDING THESE BRIDGES, THIS
IS WHERE WE FIND OURSELVES.
IT'S AN EXTRAORDINARY
TESTAMENT.
WHEN YOU LOOK TO BRETT
KAVANAUGH TESTIMONY, IN A WAY
YOU SEE SOMEONE WHO SAID
ENOUGH IS ENOUGH.
I THOUGHT THAT I WAS SOMEONE
WHO BUILT GENUINE FRIENDSHIP.
I THOUGHT I WAS SOMEONE WHO
BUILT AND CULTIVATED THIS
TRUST WITH FOLKS ON THE
LIBERAL LEFT.
INSTEAD YOU HAVE THIS
EXPERIENCE THAT FOR HIM
MUST'VE BEEN SO FEARING YOU
SEE THIS HAPPENING TOO SO MANY
CONSERVATIVES RIGHT NOW.
PEOPLE WHO FELT THEY HAND
BRIDGE THESE DIVIDES AND NOW
FEELING PERHAPS THAT'S NOT THE
CASE.
>> I HAD THAT FEELING THIS
WEEK.
I HAD THAT FEELING THIS WEEK.
>> LOOK.
STEVE, OBVIOUSLY, I AM MAD.
I'VE BEEN HONEST ABOUT THIS
ALL WEEK AND THE ONLY THING I
AGREE WITH WHAT RICHARD SAID
IS THIS IS ABOUT MERRICK
GARLAND AND POLITICAL
RETRIBUTION FOR DEMOCRATS AND
WHAT DISTURBS ME IS THEY ARE
WILLING TO DRIVE SOMEONE'S
NAME AND HIS FAMILY THROUGH
THE MUD WITHOUT ZERO EVIDENCE
OF OR ANY CORROBORATING
EVIDENCE AND THAT DOESN'T
MATTER TO THEM.
DEMOCRATS WERE ALREADY AGAINST
HIM BEFORE HE WAS NAMED FRED
WHAT ABOUT DUE PROCESS?
WHAT ABOUT HIS FAMILY?
I FIND IT DISTURBING AND
DESPICABLE THE MY CLIENTS ARE
WILLING TO DO THIS.
DON'T TRY TO SAY THEY HAVE
POLITICS, THE TERM BOARDGAME
COMES FROM THE DEMOCRATIC
PARTY.
I'VE SEEN THIS IN MY OWN TIME
WORKING ON CAMPAIGNS AND THE
LENGTHS THEY ARE WILLING TO GO
TO TRY TO HURT SOMEONE
CLINICALLY.
WE ARE TALKING ABOUT SOMEONE'S
LIFE WITH TWO YOUNG GIRLS AT
HOME AND A WIFE WHOSE HE HAD
TO EXPLAIN THIS TO END THE
STORIES THAT WERE BROUGHT TO
THE SURFACE, THE ZERO
CORROBORATING EVIDENCE.
THERE'S NOT A SINGLE WITNESS
THAT WILL STEP FORWARD AND SAY
IS TRUE.
>> DOCTOR FORD ALSO HAS A
FAMILY.
>> WHY WAS SHE IN THE
SPOTLIGHT.
THAT'S A RIDICULOUS POINT.
THE REASON DOCTOR FORD AND HER
FAMILY HAS TO SUFFER WAS THE
CHOICE OF THE DEMOCRATS.
>> STEVE, WAIT A MINUTE.
>> THEY COULD'VE MADE IT, THEY
COULD'VE HANDLED ALL THIS
PRIVACY.
>> YOU HAVE EVERY REASON TO BE
ANGRY TWO DOCTOR FORD HAS
EVERY REASON TO BE ANGRY AT
YOUR PARTY.
>> CAN I FINISH.
BOTH OF YOU HAVE REASON TO BE
ANGRY.
>> AM I GOING TO BE ABLE TO
MAKE A POINT QUEST MARK.
>> WITH YOUR PARTY.
>> YOU HAVE EVERY REASON TO BE
ANGRY BECAUSE YOU GUYS ARE.
WE HAVE HAD HUNDRED 13
DIFFERENT SUPREME COURT
JUSTICES GO THROUGH THIS
PROCESS AND MAKE IT AND NOT
ONE, NOT EVEN CLARENCE THOMAS
INVOKED POLITICS AS MUCH AS
BRETT KAVANAUGH DID IN THIS.
>> IN RESPONSE TO WHAT
HAPPENED TO HIM FROM YOUR
PARTY.
>> CLARENCE THOMAS DIDN'T EVEN
INVOKED POLITICS.
THE SUPREME COURT SHOULD BE
ABOVE POLITICAL APPROACH NO
MATTER WHOSE IN CHARGE OF THE
SENATE OR THE HOUSE.
>> HOW CAN YOU SAY THAT.
IT'S NOT EVEN WORTH HAVING A
DISCUSSION.
THAT'S RIDICULOUS.
>> THAT'S WHERE THE MIDDLE OF
AMERICA IS SPREAD.
THIS IS AMERICA.
THAT'S THE REASON WHY TWO
THAT'S RIDICULOUS.
>> THE PROBLEM ISN'T WITH
DEMOCRATS.
>> IN RESPONSE TO MARTHA'S
INTERVIEW, HE SEEMED HE WAS
GUILTY AND NOW BECAUSE HE'S
ANGRY BECAUSE THE DEMOCRATS
PARTY HAS DRAGGED HIS NAME
THROUGH THE MUD WITHOUT ANY
