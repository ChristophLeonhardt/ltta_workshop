DHS IS NO LONGER IGNORING THE LAW. WE ARE ENFORCING THE LAWS AS THEY EXIST ON THE BOOKS. AS LONG AS ILLEGAL ENTRY REMAINS A CRIMINAL OFFENSE, DHS WILL NOT LOOK THE OTHER WAY. DHS WILL FAITHFULLY EXECUTE THE LAWS ENACTED BY CONGRESS AS WE ARE SWORN TO DO. AS I SAID EARLIER TODAY, SURELY IT IS THE BEGINNING OF THE UNRAVELING OF DEMOCRACY WHEN THE BODY WHO MAKES THE LAWS, INSTEAD OF CHANGING THEM, TELLS THE ENFORCEMENT BODY NOT TO ENFORCE THE LAW. I ASKED CONGRESS TO ASK THIS WEEK SO WE CAN SECURE OUR BORDERS AND UPHOLD OUR HUMANITARIAN IDEAS. THESE TWO MISSIONS SHOULD NOT BE PITTED AGAINST EACH OTHER. IF WE CLOSE THE LOOPHOLES, WE CAN ACCOMPLISH BOTH. Bret: THE PICTURES ARE HORRIBLE. THE EMOTIONS ARE HIGH. THE CRITICISM IS ALL OVER THE PLACE, AND THE BLAME GAME HAS BEGUN IN EARNEST. WE CAN DO THIS VERY QUICKLY IF THE DEMOCRATS COME TO THE TABLE. EVERYBODY WANTS TO DO IT. WE WANT TO DO IT MORE THAN THEY DO. THEY WILL TRY TO MAKE US CHOOSE BETWEEN THESE CHILDREN AND DREAMERS. OUR DEMOCRATIC FRIENDS, EVERY TIME THEY HAVE HAD A CHANCE TO VOTE FOR A SOLUTION, THEY HAVE VOTED AGAINST IT. SO I HOPE THEY CHANGE THEIR APPROACH. PUT IT ON THE FLOOR AND LET THE PEOPLE'S HOUSE VOTE. AND YET THEY SLUMBER STILL. Bret: WITH THAT, LET'S BRING IN THE PANEL. FORMER CA ANALYST BUCK SEXTON. MARA LIASSON, NATIONAL POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT AT NATIONAL PUBLIC RADIO. MOLLIE HEMINGWAY, SENIOR EDITOR AT "THE FEDERALIST." SEEMS LIKE THIS IS COMING TO A HEAD. IT'S BEEN CONFUSING BECAUSE THIS WAS A POLICY THAT WAS MEANT AS A DETERRENT AND DESCRIBED AS A DETERRENT BY JEFF SESSIONS AND OTHERS. DON'T BRING YOUR KIDS HERE BECAUSE YOU'RE GOING TO GET SEPARATED FROM THEM IF YOU CROSS ILLEGALLY. BUT IT TURNS OUT I THINK BEING TOUGH ON IMMIGRATION. TODAY HE SAYS WE DON'T WANT OUR COUNTRY TO TURN INTO A MIGRANT CAMP OR A HOLDING PEN FOR REFUGEES. BUT HE DOESN'T WANT TO TAKE HER SPOTS ABILITY FOR THE UNPOPULAR PART OF THE POLICY WHICH IS THE SEPARATION OF KIDS FROM THEIR MOTHERS. SO HE IS BLAMING THE DEMOCRATS. IT'S BEEN TALKED OF A DETERRENT IN PARTS BECAUSE OF WHAT HAPPENED. IN PREVIOUS ADMINISTRATIONS COME ON PEOPLE CROSS THE BORDER ILLEGALLY AND CLAIMED AFTER THEY WERE CAUGHT THEY WERE ASYLUM-SEEKERS, THEY WOULD BE LET GO AND ASKED TO REPORT BACK AT A LATER DATE. PEOPLE FIGURED OUT IT WAS A GOOD WAY TO GET INTO THE COUNTRY. HE WOULD BE ABLE TO PASS THROUGH IF YOU BROUGHT CHILDREN. IT INCREASED THE NUMBER OF CHILDREN USED AS YOU WERE CROSSING THE BORDER. HE STARTED TO SEE THE NUMBER OF CASES PEOPLE CROSSING THIS WAY SKYROCKET. THEY NEED TO MAKE A DETERRENT. PEOPLE FIGURED OUT IT'S A GOOD WAY TO CROSS. THERE IS A MORAL COST CANNOT FOLLOWING THE NATION'S LAWS AND A MORAL COST TO SEPARATING CHILDREN FROM THEIR FAMILIES. IT'S IMPORTANT THAT THEY COME TOGETHER TO RESPECT THE LAWS OF THE LAND AND KEEP FAMILIES TOGETHER. Bret: SECRETARY NIELSEN ON THOSE FRAUDULENT CLAIMS GOING OUT. IN THE LAST FIVE MONTHS, WE HAVE A THREE-HEADED 14% INCREASE IN ADULTS AND CHILDREN ARRIVING AT THE BORDER FRAUDULENTLY CLAIMING TO BE A FAMILY UNIT. THIS IS OBVIOUSLY OF CONCERN. SEPARATION CAN OCCUR WHEN THE PARENT IS CHARGED WITH HUMAN SMUGGLING. UNDER THOSE CIRCUMSTANCES, WE WOULD DETAIN THE PARENT IN AN APPROPRIATE SECURED DETENTION FACILITY SEPARATE FROM THE CHILD. Bret: BOX, NO MATTER HOW YOU EXCITING, THEY SAY THEY'RE GOING TO SEEK ASYLUM, THEY CHOOSE TO SEPARATE, WITH THEIR PERCENTAGES THREE AND A 1% THEIR PERCENTAGES THREE AND A 1, THE IMAGES AND THE EMOTION AROUND THE ISSUE ARE A POLITICAL DYNAMITE. TRUMP UNDERSTANDS THIS HAS TO BE HANDLED. YOU CAN'T HAVE MOTHERS BEING SEPARATED FROM INCREDIBLY YOUNG CHILDREN. I THINK THERE WILL BE A GOOD FAITH EFFORT TO SOLVE THAT PART. THERE'S A LEGACY OF LAWLESSNESS HERE AND I THINK IT BECOMES TOO APPARENT THAT NOT JUST THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION BUT THE CURRENT DEMOCRAT PARTY WOULD PREFER A SITUATION WHERE ESSENTIALLY ANYBODY WHO CAN GET IN THE COUNTRY CAN STAY. AT SOME POINT, THEY HAVE TO BE WILLING TO ANSWER THE QUESTION WHICH ILLEGAL ALIENS ARE NO LONGER ALLOWED TO STAY IN THE COUNTRY? THEY CREATED THIS LOOPHOLE, A MASSIVE FRONT DOOR ENTRYWAY BY BRINGING A CHILD WITH YOU, THAN IT BECAME EASY TO STAY IN THE COUNTRY. YOU WANT TO FIX THE ISSUE OF SEPARATING PARENTS AND CHILDREN WHILE BEING PROCESSED. BUT YOU ALSO DO HAVE TO ENFORCE THE LAW BY PEOPLE COMING HERE ILLEGALLY. IN MANY CASES, CLAIMING ASYLUM IN BAD FAITH. THEY ARE SAYING WITH A BUNDLED ESSAY. THE WORD IS OUT. SECRETARY NIELSEN HAS BEEN ADDRESSING THAT. YOUNG PEOPLE UNACCOMPANIED, THEY ARE IN JEOPARDY. MANY THOUSANDS OF ON THE COMPANY OF MINORS ARE SO SHORT OF THE BORDER WITH ANYBODY. THAT IS DANGEROUS FOR THEM TOO. THE INCENTIVE PUT IN PLACE BY THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION HAS TO STOP. IT HAS TO END. Bret: PROSPECTS OF FORCING A BIPARTISAN SOLUTION, DOES IT CHANGE? LAST WEEK THE PROSPECT OF IMMIGRATION LAW GETTING INTO LAW, BILL GETTING INTO LAW, WAS PRETTY SMALL. IT LOOKED BAD. THEY HAVE BEEN SO MANY ATTEMPTS OVER THE PAST YEAR. ONE WAS THE DEAL, WE WILL GIVE YOU FULL FUNDING FOR THE WALL IF YOU LEGALIZE THE DREAMERS. NOW IT IS SOMETHING AKIN TO THAT BUT ALSO WE WANT TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT SEPARATING KIDS FROM THEIR FAMILIES. DONALD TRUMP IS ASKED FOR A 44% DECREASE IN LEGAL IMMIGRATION WHICH THE DEMOCRATS HAVE BALKED AT. I THINK IF YOU'VE GOT IT DOWN TO A PRETTY SKINNY BILL, WALL, DREAMERS, KIDS AND FAMILY POLICIES, MAYBE YOU COULD GET SOMETHING BUT I DON'T KNOW IF THAT'S WHERE CONGRESS IS HEADING. Bret: THE DREADED "SKINNY BILL." SENATOR TED CRUZ INTRODUCED LEGISLATION THAT WOULD DEAL WITH THIS. THE BIG ISSUE IS THAT YOU CAN'T DETAIN CHILDREN FOR MORE THAN 20 DAYS. IT TAKES LONG TO DEAL WITH ADJUDICATING THE ILLEGAL BORDER CROSSINGS THAT THEN CLAIM ASYLUM THEN ENDS UP IN FAMILY SEPARATION. HIS BILL WOULD REQUIRE THAT YOU ADJUDICATE THIS WITHIN TWO WEEKS AND IF YOU FAIL TO PASS TEST, YOU'RE DEPORTED AS OF FAMILY AND OTHERWISE YOU CAN BE REUNITED AT THAT POINT. Bret: WE SHOULD SAY SECRETARY NIELSEN MADE A POINT TO SAVE YOU GO TO A PORT OF ENTRY, THEN YOU CAN CLAIM ASYLUM AND STAY TOGETHER AS A FAMILY IF THERE'S ROOM. AND IF THEY THINK YOU ARE A REAL FAMILY. Bret: HERE IS A BLAST FROM THE PAST, IF YOU WILL. HILLARY CLINTON ON THIS ISSUE. THE PRESIDENT'S ATTEMPT TODAY TO STOKE FEAR OF IMMIGRANTS NOT ONLY AN HOUR COUNTRY BUT AROUND THE WORLD BY CLAIMING THAT MIGRANTS IN GERMANY ARE CAUSING CRIME. IN FACT, CRIME IN GERMANY IS AT ITS LOWEST LEVEL SINCE 1992. NOR ARE THESE POLICIES ROOTED IN RELIGION. IN FACT, THOSE WHO SELECTIVELY USE THE BIBLE TO JUSTIFY THIS CRUELTY ARE IGNORING A CENTRAL TENET OF CHRISTIANITY. Bret: IT'S BEEN A LONG TIME ON THIS ISSUE, AS YOU CAN IMAGINE, TOUCHING ALL ELEMENTS. VERY DISHONEST IN TERMS OF WHAT MRS. CLINTON IS PRESENTING AS WHAT IS HAPPENING IN GERMANY. SINCE 1982, WHAT HAS HAPPENED DOESN'T MATTER. WHAT HAS HAPPENED SINCE THE MASSIVE MIGRANT WAVE AND IT'S CLEAR YOU HAD A 10% INCREASE IN VIOLENT CRIME, HOMICIDE, RAPE, THE CRIMES PEOPLE CARE ABOUT AND NOTICE. ONE SLOW START TO HIT THE AIRWAVES. THERE IS A HESITATION IN THE EUROPEAN COUNTRIES TO SPEAK OPENLY ABOUT THESE CRIMES. WE SEE IT IN SWEDEN AND GERMANY. THE PRESS DOESN'T WANT TO DEAL WITH IT. SHE'S WRONG ON THE FACTS. RATHER, SHE IS MISCONSTRUING THE REALITY OF WHAT'S HAPPENING, PICKING WHAT HAPPENED SINCE 1992. THEY DO HAVE SERIOUS PROBLEMS IN GERMANY WITH THE MIGRANT WAVE. SERIOUS PROBLEMS IN OTHER PARTS OF EUROPE AS WELL. MRS. CLINTON KNOWS THAT BUT RIGHT NOW IT'S BETTER TO PLAY TO THE EMOTIONS. Bret: WHEN YOU HAVE HILLARY CLINTON AND LAURA BUSH ON THE SAME ISSUE, DOES IT CREATE A BIGGER FORCE? LAURA BUSH WAS AN EXTRA ORDINARY ENTRY INTO THE DEBATE. SHE DOESN'T EVER COMMENT ON THINGS LIKE THIS, AND SHE DID. THE OTHER ASPECT OF THE TWEET, HE WENT AFTER ANGELA MERKEL. SUGGESTING THAT HER HOLD ON POWER WAS TEETERING ON THE BRINK BECAUSE OF THIS. IT WAS LIKE HE WAS ISSUING HIS AMBASSADOR TO GERMANY, ENCOURAGING CONSERVATIVE PARTIES TO TAKE OVER. THE KIND OF MEDDLING I DON'T THINK YOU WOULD LIKE IF A FOREIGN LEADER DID. ANGELA MERKEL IS HAVING POLITICAL TROUBLE.
