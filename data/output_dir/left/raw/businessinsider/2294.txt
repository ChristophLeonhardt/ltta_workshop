00:00:06,410 --> 00:00:08,429
wikipedia has become total global

2
00:00:08,429 --> 00:00:10,440
phenomenon fifth biggest website in the

3
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:14,009
world absolutely huge integral two

4
00:00:14,009 --> 00:00:15,420
cultures everything else but when you

5
00:00:15,420 --> 00:00:17,039
started it<font color="#E5E5E5"> it sounds like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a lot of other</font>

6
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:18,869
entrepreneurs you had a different

7
00:00:18,869 --> 00:00:21,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">concept that then evolved into this yeah</font>

8
00:00:21,060 --> 00:00:24,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">I originally had the idea for freely</font>

9
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,680
licensed encyclopedia written<font color="#CCCCCC"> by</font>

10
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:27,180
volunteers and all the<font color="#CCCCCC"> language of the</font>

11
00:00:27,180 --> 00:00:29,580
world back in nineteen ninety<font color="#CCCCCC"> nine but I</font>

12
00:00:29,580 --> 00:00:31,050
didn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> really know how to make it happen</font>

13
00:00:31,050 --> 00:00:32,630
<font color="#CCCCCC">you know I was watching the growth of</font>

14
00:00:32,630 --> 00:00:35,370
open-source software free software and

15
00:00:35,370 --> 00:00:39,000
seeing amazing things happening so our

16
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,890
first concept of how<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do it was very</font>

17
00:00:40,890 --> 00:00:43,500
top-down<font color="#E5E5E5"> I was called new pedia it had</font>

18
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:45,950
set we have seven<font color="#E5E5E5"> stage review process</font>

19
00:00:45,950 --> 00:00:48,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">people actually for a while had to fax</font>

20
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,010
in their diplomas to prove they were

21
00:00:50,010 --> 00:00:52,949
qualified to write something and as you

22
00:00:52,949 --> 00:00:55,440
might expect it<font color="#E5E5E5"> was complete failure we</font>

23
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:57,270
really got very little work done because

24
00:00:57,270 --> 00:00:58,980
it was very intimidating<font color="#CCCCCC"> for people to</font>

25
00:00:58,980 --> 00:01:01,620
participate so then when I heard<font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font>

26
00:01:01,620 --> 00:01:03,420
the wicking concept which had actually

27
00:01:03,420 --> 00:01:06,240
been around<font color="#E5E5E5"> since 95 and we launched</font>

28
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:08,369
that it was a completely radical change

29
00:01:08,369 --> 00:01:09,810
of direction take us through that

30
00:01:09,810 --> 00:01:12,780
process because obviously wikipedia has

31
00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:15,270
been shot at forever bio anybody can

32
00:01:15,270 --> 00:01:16,710
edit it so forth<font color="#E5E5E5"> having to be credible</font>

33
00:01:16,710 --> 00:01:18,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">that kind of thing so right when you</font>

34
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,590
were conceiving of it it must have

35
00:01:19,590 --> 00:01:21,330
sounded<font color="#E5E5E5"> like it would have been a good</font>

36
00:01:21,330 --> 00:01:23,970
idea Utley insane right this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> the most</font>

37
00:01:23,970 --> 00:01:25,560
insane thing ever you're going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> open a</font>

38
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:27,750
website let anybody edit it and expect

39
00:01:27,750 --> 00:01:29,369
it to be anything other than complete

40
00:01:29,369 --> 00:01:31,890
rubbish so the real key to understanding

41
00:01:31,890 --> 00:01:34,049
<font color="#E5E5E5">Wikipedia is what are the pieces behind</font>

42
00:01:34,049 --> 00:01:36,750
that how does<font color="#CCCCCC"> that work and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's a mix</font>

43
00:01:36,750 --> 00:01:39,659
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> things it's the software meaning the</font>

44
00:01:39,659 --> 00:01:41,490
tools that we give to the volunteers so

45
00:01:41,490 --> 00:01:43,500
people have things like recent changes

46
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:44,820
where they can check what's changed

47
00:01:44,820 --> 00:01:46,770
<font color="#CCCCCC">recently they've watched list so they</font>

48
00:01:46,770 --> 00:01:48,420
can monitor things we have the ability

49
00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:50,030
to block people if they're misbehaving

50
00:01:50,030 --> 00:01:52,229
also we keep the history of every

51
00:01:52,229 --> 00:01:53,909
version so if somebody does come in and

52
00:01:53,909 --> 00:01:55,829
make a mess we just<font color="#CCCCCC"> fix</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it we just</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> go</font>

53
00:01:55,829 --> 00:01:57,240
back<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the previous versions one click</font>

54
00:01:57,240 --> 00:01:58,890
to do that so it's all<font color="#E5E5E5"> of those things</font>

55
00:01:58,890 --> 00:02:02,280
on the one<font color="#E5E5E5"> hand the software but then</font>

56
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:04,680
it's also the social aspect of thing so

57
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:06,509
it's really bringing together a

58
00:02:06,509 --> 00:02:08,520
passionate community of volunteers who

59
00:02:08,520 --> 00:00:00,000
really care about quality
