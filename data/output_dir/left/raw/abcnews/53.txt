18
00:00:28,694 --> 00:00:30,897
SIGNIFICANT INCIDENT.

I 5 CONTINUES TO BE SHUT DOWN.

23
00:00:41,207 --> 00:00:44,844
THESE IMAGES WE SEE OF THIS 

24
00:00:44,844 --> 00:00:47,647
TRAIN CAR, ONE DANGLING OVER 

25
00:00:47,647 --> 00:00:49,048

THE SHERIFF SAID THEY'RE RUSHING

27
00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:52,452

THERE ARE MANY PERSONNEL THERE 

29

TRYING TO ATTEND TO THE WOUNDED.

30
00:00:55,788 --> 00:00:56,556
THERE ARE CASUALTIES.

31
00:00:56,556 --> 00:00:57,657
IN ADDITION TO THAT PICTURE WE 

32
00:00:57,657 --> 00:01:00,359
SEE OF THAT ONE CAR DANGLING 

33
00:01:00,359 --> 00:01:01,560
OVER THE OVERPASS THERE ARE 

34
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:04,030
OTHER CARS THAT APPEAR TO BE 

35
00:01:04,030 --> 00:01:05,265
DERAILED.

36
00:01:05,265 --> 00:01:06,899
UNCLEAR WHERE THE INJURIES ARE 

37
00:01:06,899 --> 00:01:09,502
OR THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THESE 

38
00:01:09,502 --> 00:01:15,541
CASUALTIES AT THIS EVENT. 

39
00:01:15,541 --> 00:01:18,545

41
00:01:18,945 --> 00:01:26,386
I WANT TO GO TO DAVID KERLEY.

42
00:01:26,386 --> 00:01:29,789
>> THIS IS I 5 AND THE AMTRAK

00:01:32,392 --> 00:01:33,960
VANCOUVER, SEATTLE AND PORTLAND.

45
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:35,895
A LOT OF TRAFFIC IN THIS AREA.

46
00:01:35,895 --> 00:01:38,664
IT'S UNCLEAR -- THIS IS 

47
00:01:38,664 --> 00:01:41,734
SUPPOSEDLY A NEW LOCK MOTIVE.

48
00:01:41,734 --> 00:01:44,704
I'M NOT SURE IF IT'S THE 

49
00:01:44,704 --> 00:01:45,939
INAUGURAL TRIP.

50
00:01:45,939 --> 00:01:47,573
IT'S NOT CLEAR WHETHER THIS 

51
00:01:47,573 --> 00:01:51,511
DERAILED BY ITSELF OR IT HIT 

52
00:01:51,511 --> 00:01:52,612
SOMETHING.

53
00:01:52,612 --> 00:01:56,482
WE'VE SEEN CRASHES IN THE PAST A

54
00:01:56,482 --> 00:01:58,718
TRAIN RAN INTO A TRUCK OR A 

55
00:01:58,718 --> 00:02:00,486
VEHICLE CROSSING THERE.

56
00:02:00,486 --> 00:02:02,221
TOO EARLY TO KNOW WHAT HAS 

57
00:02:02,221 --> 00:02:05,257
HAPPENED WITH THIS AMTRAK TRAIN.

58
00:02:05,257 --> 00:02:07,393
TO SEE A CAR LIKE THAT HANGING 

59
00:02:07,393 --> 00:02:12,465
OVER THE BRIDGE ON TO ONE OF THE

60
00:02:12,465 --> 00:02:16,603
BUSIEST PIECES OF REAL ESTATE IS

61
00:02:16,603 --> 00:02:16,870
DRAMATIC. 

62
00:02:16,870 --> 00:02:18,705
>> DAVID, AS YOU SAY IT'S A 

63
00:02:18,705 --> 00:02:20,706
MAJOR, MAJOR ARTERY. 

64
00:02:20,706 --> 00:02:21,407
>> YES.

65
00:02:21,407 --> 00:02:23,009
MOST OF THE TRAFFIC IN THAT PART

66
00:02:23,009 --> 00:02:25,044
OF THE COUNTRY IN THE NORTHWEST 

67
00:02:25,044 --> 00:02:26,845
IS THIS NORTH SOUND CORRIDOR OF 

68
00:02:26,845 --> 00:02:27,847
I 5.

69
00:02:27,847 --> 00:02:30,349
THE TRAINS ARE GOING TO GO DOWN 

70
00:02:30,349 --> 00:02:32,819
TO CALIFORNIA OR INTO VANCOUVER.

71
00:02:32,819 --> 00:02:34,687
THIS IS THE LIFE LINE ALONG THE 

72
00:02:34,687 --> 00:02:35,221
WEST COAST. 

73
00:02:35,221 --> 00:02:37,189
>> THIS WAS A TRAIN THAT LEFT 

74
00:02:37,189 --> 00:02:38,858
SEATTLE AROUND 6:00 A.M.

75
00:02:38,858 --> 00:02:42,195
APPARENTLY THE INCIDENT HAPPENED

76
00:02:42,195 --> 00:02:43,096
AROUND 8:01.

77
00:02:43,096 --> 00:02:46,232
MATT GUTMAN EMERGENCY RESPONDERS

78
00:02:46,232 --> 00:02:47,000
REPORTING TO THE SCENE?

79
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,468
>> ABSOLUTELY.

80
00:02:48,468 --> 00:02:52,071
WE SEE THEM STREAMING IN THERE.

81
00:02:52,071 --> 00:02:53,806
AMBULANCE AFTER AMBULANCE.

82
00:02:53,806 --> 00:02:55,908
THEY'RE HAVING TO NAVIGATE 

83
00:02:55,908 --> 00:02:57,877
THROUGH THE MASSIVE TRAFFIC JAM.

84
00:02:57,877 --> 00:02:59,178
IT'S ALREADY MILES LONG.

85
00:02:59,178 --> 00:03:00,479
WE HAVE UNDERSTAND THEY'RE AT 

86
00:03:00,479 --> 00:03:00,780
THE SCENE.

87
00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:04,050
I ASSUME THEY'RE DOING TRIAGE.

88
00:03:04,050 --> 00:03:06,385
AS YOU AND DAVID MENTIONED, NOT 

89
00:03:06,385 --> 00:03:09,622
ONLY IS THE I5 CORRIDOR FROM THE

90
00:03:09,622 --> 00:03:11,324
BORDER OF MEXICO AND SAN DIEGO 

91
00:03:11,324 --> 00:03:18,197
TO THE BORDER OF CANADA, BUT 

92
00:03:18,197 --> 00:03:26,039
THIS IS ONE OF THE BUSIEST 

93
00:03:26,039 --> 00:03:26,239
TIMES.

94
00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:27,773
IT WAS THE ENTER SINTERSECTION  

95
00:03:27,773 --> 00:03:30,209
MAJOR RAILROAD ROUTE IN THE 

96
00:03:30,209 --> 00:03:31,344
NORTHWEST.

97
00:03:31,344 --> 00:03:32,311
TREMENDOUS NUMBER OF PEOPLE IN 

98
00:03:32,311 --> 00:03:33,713
THE CONFLUENCE OF ALL THESE 

99
00:03:33,713 --> 00:03:35,248
PEOPLE AT ONE TIME.

100
00:03:35,248 --> 00:03:36,716
I IMAGINE IT'S GOING TO BE 

101
00:03:36,716 --> 00:03:38,484
DIFFICULT FOR LAW ENFORCEMENT 

102
00:03:38,484 --> 00:03:40,520
AND FOR MEDICAL PERSONNEL TO GET

103
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:41,421
THERE.

104
00:03:41,421 --> 00:03:43,089
WE'RE SEEING NEW IMAGES COMING 

105
00:03:43,089 --> 00:03:43,890
ACROSS NOW.

106
00:03:43,890 --> 00:03:46,359
THERE APPEARS TO BE MEDICAL 

107
00:03:46,359 --> 00:03:47,827
PERSONNEL TENDING TO WHAT SEEM 

108
00:03:47,827 --> 00:03:50,162
TO BE WOUNDED OR AT LEAST 

109
00:03:50,162 --> 00:03:53,866
WORKING ON WRECKAGE ON I5, 

110
00:03:53,866 --> 00:03:55,434
WORKING ON DEBRIS FROM WHERE 

111
00:03:55,434 --> 00:03:58,871
THAT TRAIN SEEMS TO BE DANGLING 

112
00:03:58,871 --> 00:04:00,373
OFF THE OVERPASS.

113
00:04:00,373 --> 00:04:02,842
WE SEE PEOPLE ABOVE THE TRAIN 

114
00:04:02,842 --> 00:04:04,677
TRACK, ABOVE THE INTERSTATE AND 

115
00:04:04,677 --> 00:04:07,079
ON THE INTERSTATE ITSELF.

116
00:04:07,079 --> 00:04:11,718
THIS IS A SIGNIFICANT EVENT.

117
00:04:11,718 --> 00:04:13,686
THERE'S DOZENS OF AMBULANCES 

118
00:04:13,686 --> 00:04:16,656
MOVING TO THE SCENE.

119
00:04:16,656 --> 00:04:18,656
>> DAVID KERLEY SEVERAL 

120
00:04:18,656 --> 00:04:21,060
INCIDENTS WITH TRAINS OVER THE 

121
00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:22,862
PAST YEARS.

122
00:04:22,862 --> 00:04:29,502
SOMETIMES OPERATOR ERROR, 

123
00:04:29,502 --> 00:04:31,270
SOMETIMES PROBLEMS WITH THE 

124
00:04:31,270 --> 00:04:31,503
TRAIN. 

125
00:04:31,503 --> 00:04:33,906
>> ABSOLUTELY GEORGE.

126
00:04:33,906 --> 00:04:35,374
IT'S A LITTLE EARLY TO BE 

127
00:04:35,374 --> 00:04:38,745
TALKING ABOUT THIS.

128
00:04:38,745 --> 00:04:40,146
IN THE PHILADELPHIA DERAILMENT 

129
00:04:40,146 --> 00:04:43,850
BECAUSE THE ENGINEER WAS DRIVING

130
00:04:43,850 --> 00:04:47,186
TOO FAST, THAT DERAILMENT WERE 

131
00:04:47,186 --> 00:04:49,355
LESSONS LEARNED FOR AMTRAK AND 

132
00:04:49,355 --> 00:04:51,090
REGULATORS THAT THE RAIL CARS 

133
00:04:51,090 --> 00:04:53,359
WE'RE TRAVELING IN DON'T ALWAYS 

134
00:04:53,359 --> 00:04:55,828
STAND UP TO THESE HIGH IMPACT 

135
00:04:55,828 --> 00:04:56,095
ACCIDENTS.

136
00:04:56,095 --> 00:04:57,730
I DON'T KNOW WHAT KIND OF CARS 

137
00:04:57,730 --> 00:04:59,532
THIS TRAIN WAS CARRYING AND 

138
00:04:59,532 --> 00:05:01,334
ROLLING DOWN THE RAILS.

139
00:05:01,334 --> 00:05:03,703
THAT'S GOING TO BE SOMETHING DID

140
00:05:03,703 --> 00:05:04,970
WE LEARN OUR LESSON FROM 

141
00:05:04,970 --> 00:05:11,077
PHILADELPHIA SEVERAL YEARS AGO.

142
00:05:11,077 --> 00:05:11,911
HAVE THESE CARS BEEN IMPROVED?

143
00:05:11,911 --> 00:05:15,448
>> DAVID, EXPLAIN WHAT KIND OF 

144
00:05:15,448 --> 00:05:17,016
IMPACT THIS WILL HAVE ON TRAIN 

145
00:05:17,016 --> 00:05:19,485
TRAVEL ACROSS THE NORTHWEST AT 

146
00:05:19,485 --> 00:05:22,188
THIS TIME OF YEAR?

147
00:05:22,188 --> 00:05:24,857
>> IT'S GOING TO BE VERY, VERY 

148
00:05:24,857 --> 00:05:25,391
PROBLEMATIC.

149
00:05:25,391 --> 00:05:26,892
IT WILL DEPEND ON HOW MUCH 

150
00:05:26,892 --> 00:05:29,161
DAMAGE WAS DONE TO THE RAILS 

151
00:05:29,161 --> 00:05:31,831
BECAUSE YOU WOULD BE SURPRISED 

152
00:05:31,831 --> 00:05:33,732
AT HOW QUICKLY THESE RAIL 

153
00:05:33,732 --> 00:05:35,401
WORKERS AND RAIL COMPANIES DEAL 

154
00:05:35,401 --> 00:05:37,737
WITH AN ACCIDENT LIKE THIS.

155
00:05:37,737 --> 00:05:41,073
WE'RE STILL DEALING WITH THOSE 

156
00:05:41,073 --> 00:05:43,075
POTENTIALLY INJURED IN THOSE 

157
00:05:43,075 --> 00:05:43,743
CARS.

158
00:05:43,743 --> 00:05:45,411
THEY'LL BE ABLE TO CLEAR THE 

159
00:05:45,411 --> 00:05:47,713
TRAIN PRETTY QUICKLY IF THERE'S 

160
00:05:47,713 --> 00:05:49,982
NOT SERIOUS DAMAGE TO THE RAILS.

161
00:05:49,982 --> 00:05:51,818
IT COULD BE OPENED FAIRLY 

162
00:05:51,818 --> 00:05:52,385
QUICKLY.

163
00:05:52,385 --> 00:05:54,720
IF THERE'S SERIOUS DAMAGE, 

164
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:55,855
THAT'S PROBLEMATIC.

165
00:05:55,855 --> 00:05:58,191
WHEN YOU'RE TRAVELING ON THESE 

166
00:05:58,191 --> 00:06:00,125
MAIN ARTERIES OF RAIL LINES 

167
00:06:00,125 --> 00:06:03,129
THERE ARE OFTEN TWO OR THREE 

168
00:06:03,129 --> 00:06:03,463
SETS.

169
00:06:03,463 --> 00:06:04,930
CAN THEY MOVE SOME OF THE 

170
00:06:04,930 --> 00:06:05,965
TRAFFIC OVER?

171
00:06:05,965 --> 00:06:07,533
IT'S GOING TO BE A CONCERN.

172
00:06:07,533 --> 00:06:09,168
WE'RE GETTING TO THE PEAK 

173
00:06:09,168 --> 00:06:10,236
SEASON.

174
00:06:10,236 --> 00:06:12,004
HUNDREDS AND THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE

175
00:06:12,004 --> 00:06:16,174
TRAVEL HOME FOR THE HOLIDAYS ON 

176
00:06:16,241 --> 00:06:17,409
AMTRAK ALONG THAT ROUTE. 

177
00:06:17,409 --> 00:06:20,847
>> WE SEE THAT CAR HANGING OFF 

178
00:06:20,847 --> 00:06:23,316
THE OVERPASS, MATT, ON TO THE 

179
00:06:23,316 --> 00:06:23,549
HIGHWAY.

180
00:06:23,549 --> 00:06:26,219
ANY IDEA THE NUMBERS ON THE OVER

181
00:06:26,219 --> 00:06:28,921
ALL TRAIN, WHETHER CARS SLAMMED 

182
00:06:28,921 --> 00:06:30,490
INTO ANY PART OF THE TRAIN?

183
00:06:30,490 --> 00:06:32,491
>> IT'S HARD TO TELL AT THIS 

184
00:06:32,491 --> 00:06:33,125
POINT, GEORGE.

185
00:06:33,125 --> 00:06:35,227
THERE SEEMS TO BE SOME DEBRIS ON

186
00:06:35,227 --> 00:06:36,963
THE ROADWAY.

187
00:06:36,963 --> 00:06:39,465
I CAN'T TELL AT THIS POINT 

188
00:06:39,465 --> 00:06:41,267
WHETHER IT IS VEHICLES OR BUSES.

189
00:06:41,267 --> 00:06:43,001
IT ACTUALLY LOOKS LIKE ONE OF 

190
00:06:43,001 --> 00:06:47,806
THE RAIL CARS ACTUALLY CAREENED 

191
00:06:47,806 --> 00:06:51,777
OFF THE TRACKS AND LANDED IN THE

192
00:06:51,777 --> 00:06:52,512
I5 ROADWAY.

193
00:06:52,512 --> 00:06:56,916
IT APPEARS SIGNIFICANTLY 

194
00:06:56,916 --> 00:06:58,684
DAMAGED, PERHAPS EVEN FLIPPED 

195
00:06:58,684 --> 00:06:58,884
OVER.

196
00:06:58,884 --> 00:07:00,786
YOU SEE MEDICAL PERSONNEL AND 

197
00:07:00,786 --> 00:07:02,688
FIRST RESPONDERS WORKING ON 

198
00:07:02,688 --> 00:07:02,888
THAT.

199
00:07:02,888 --> 00:07:04,657
THIS SEEMS TO BE A VERY 

200
00:07:04,657 --> 00:07:06,025
SIGNIFICANT CRASH.

201
00:07:06,025 --> 00:07:08,961
WHATEVER HAPPENED TO DERAIL THIS

202
00:07:08,961 --> 00:07:11,363
TRAIN, THAT'S GOING TO COME 

203
00:07:11,363 --> 00:07:12,365
SECOND.

204
00:07:12,365 --> 00:07:13,566
FIRST FIGURING OUT HOW MANY 

205
00:07:13,566 --> 00:07:15,200
PEOPLE HAVE BEEN HURT AND 

206
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:18,570
WHISKING THEM OFF TO SAFETY AND 

207
00:07:18,570 --> 00:07:20,172
EVACUATE THEM TO HOSPITAL IF 

208
00:07:20,172 --> 00:07:22,842
THAT'S POSSIBLE.

209
00:07:22,842 --> 00:07:24,644
CLEARLY MEDICAL PERSONNEL ARE 

210
00:07:24,644 --> 00:07:24,844
THERE.

211
00:07:24,844 --> 00:07:26,946
THE SHERIFF IS ON IT.

212
00:07:26,946 --> 00:07:29,381
THEY SET UP A MEDIA STAGING 

213
00:07:29,381 --> 00:07:29,649
POINT.

214
00:07:29,649 --> 00:07:32,284
THEY CREATED A PERIMETER AND 

215
00:07:32,284 --> 00:07:34,186
TAKE CONTROL OF THE SITUATION.

216
00:07:34,186 --> 00:07:35,120
UNCLEAR HOW MANY PEOPLE HAVE 

217
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:36,188
BEEN AFFECTED.

218
00:07:36,188 --> 00:07:41,360
IT SEEMS LIKE THIS IS A MASS 

219
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:42,361
CAS

220
00:07:42,361 --> 00:07:42,894
CAS

221
00:07:42,894 --> 00:07:44,296
CASUALTY EVENT. 

222
00:07:44,296 --> 00:07:45,764
>> DAVID THE NATIONAL 

223
00:07:45,764 --> 00:07:47,099
TRANSPORTATION AND SAFETY BOARD 

224
00:07:47,099 --> 00:07:49,235
WILL TAKE CONTROL OF THIS 

225
00:07:49,235 --> 00:07:49,602
INVESTIGATION. 

226
00:07:49,602 --> 00:07:51,904
>> THEY WILL BE LAUNCHING A TEAM

227
00:07:51,904 --> 00:07:52,738
TO INVESTIGATE.

228
00:07:52,738 --> 00:07:54,806
THE OFFICIAL STATEMENT FROM 

229
00:07:54,806 --> 00:07:58,276
AMTRAK IS THAT THEY'RE AWARE OF 

230
00:07:58,276 --> 00:07:59,878
THE INCIDENT OF THE TRAIN WHICH 

231
00:07:59,878 --> 00:08:02,114
WAS RUNNING FROM SEATTLE TO 

232
00:08:02,114 --> 00:08:02,515
PORTLAND.

233
00:08:02,515 --> 00:08:06,018
IT SAYS THEY HAVE REPORT OF SOME

234
00:08:06,018 --> 00:08:06,953
INJURIES.

235
00:08:06,953 --> 00:08:09,322
AND SERVICE IS TEMPORARILY 

236
00:08:09,322 --> 00:08:10,256
SUSPENDED.

237
00:08:10,256 --> 00:08:15,995
IT SEEMS MORE SERIOUS THAN THE 

238
00:08:15,995 --> 00:08:17,129
STATEMENT REFLECTS.

239
00:08:17,129 --> 00:08:19,398
THE ANSWER THAT IS WILL COME OUT

240
00:08:19,398 --> 00:08:22,001
OF THE INVESTIGATION ALL AIMED 

241
00:08:22,001 --> 00:08:24,437
AT SOMETHING LIKE THIS HAPPENING

242
00:08:24,437 --> 00:08:24,670
AGAIN. 

243
00:08:24,670 --> 00:08:28,407
>> THE INCIDENTS WE'VE DEALT 

244
00:08:28,407 --> 00:08:30,142
WITH HAVE BEEN ON THE EAST 

245
00:08:30,142 --> 00:08:30,342
COAST.

246
00:08:30,342 --> 00:08:32,077
THIS IS THE FIRST MAJOR ON THE 

247
00:08:32,077 --> 00:08:33,111
WEST COAST. 

248
00:08:33,111 --> 00:08:34,679
>> THERE HAVE BEEN SOME ON THE 

249
00:08:34,679 --> 00:08:36,649
WEST COAST AND MORE LIKE METRO 

250
00:08:36,649 --> 00:08:39,650
TYPE REGIONAL CARRIERS HAVE HAD 

251
00:08:39,650 --> 00:08:43,222
SOME ISSUES AS WELL.

252
00:08:43,222 --> 00:08:46,125
RAIL TRAFFIC STILL CONSIDERABLY 

253
00:08:46,125 --> 00:08:46,492
STAVE.

254
00:08:46,492 --> 00:08:49,094
IT'S STILL SAFER TO GET ON A 

255
00:08:49,094 --> 00:08:51,497
TRAIN THAN DRIVE AROUND IN YOUR 

256
00:08:51,497 --> 00:08:51,697
CAR. 

257
00:08:51,697 --> 00:08:54,600
>> MATT GUTMAN, I HAVEN'T SEEN 

258
00:08:54,600 --> 00:09:05,578
ANYTHING TO INDICATE

259
00:09:05,578 --> 00:09:06,779
THIS POINT, GEORGE.

260
00:09:06,779 --> 00:09:08,580
ALL WE CAN SAY IS WHAT WE SEE 

261
00:09:08,580 --> 00:09:12,051
AND REPEAT WHAT OFFICIALS ARE 

262
00:09:12,051 --> 00:09:12,351
TELLING US.

263
00:09:12,351 --> 00:09:15,187
THEY E'RE ON THE SCENE.

264
00:09:15,187 --> 00:09:16,555
DOZENS OF AMBULANCES THERE.

265
00:09:16,555 --> 00:09:20,092
IT APPEARS TO BE A PRETTY 

266
00:09:20,092 --> 00:09:21,160
SIGNIFICANT CRASH.

267
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:22,995
THE PICTURES WE'RE SEEING IS 

268
00:09:22,995 --> 00:09:25,030
THAT ONE RAIL CAR DANGLING OFF 

269
00:09:25,030 --> 00:09:26,431
THE OVERPASS.

270
00:09:26,431 --> 00:09:29,268
ANOTHER SEEMS TO HAVE CRASHES 

271
00:09:29,268 --> 00:09:30,870
UNDERNEATH IT, FLIPPED OVER.

272
00:09:30,870 --> 00:09:33,239
THERE ARE FIRST RESPONDERS ON 

273
00:09:33,239 --> 00:09:36,042
THE SCENE AND LADDERS ON THE TOP

274
00:09:36,042 --> 00:09:38,944
LEADING TO THE FLIPPED OVER RAIL

275
00:09:38,944 --> 00:09:40,046
CAR.

276
00:09:40,046 --> 00:09:42,681
ONE THAT DISTINGUISHES THE EAST 

277
00:09:42,681 --> 00:09:46,218
COAST FROM WEST COAST.

278
00:09:46,218 --> 00:09:47,953
THERE'S A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF 

279
00:09:47,953 --> 00:09:50,555
CARGO, OIL, CHEMICALS MOVED 

280
00:09:50,555 --> 00:09:52,958
AROUND AND TRANSPORTED.

281
00:09:52,958 --> 00:09:58,897
THE EAST COAST ESPECIALLY THAT 

282
00:09:58,897 --> 00:10:02,568
CORRIDOR IS WHERE PEOPLE TRAVEL.

283
00:10:02,568 --> 00:10:07,940
THIS LINE NOT SOMETHING AS 

284
00:10:07,940 --> 00:10:08,407
FREQUENTLY TRAVELLED.

285
00:10:08,407 --> 00:10:10,609
WE ASSUME THERE WERE MANY PEOPLE

286
00:10:10,609 --> 00:10:12,211
ON THIS TRAIN WHEN IT TRAVELLED.

287
00:10:12,211 --> 00:10:15,314
IT SEEMS A SIGNIFICANT INCIDENT.

288
00:10:15,314 --> 00:10:17,850
WE'RE STARTING TO GET SOME NEW 

289
00:10:17,850 --> 00:10:18,083
IMAGES.

290
00:10:18,083 --> 00:10:20,319
SEE CARS LINED UP.

291
00:10:20,319 --> 00:10:21,320
FLASHERS THERE.

292
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:24,256
THEY'RE INTERMINGLED WITH FIRST 

293
00:10:24,256 --> 00:10:26,592
RESPONDERS RUSHING TO THE SCENE.

294
00:10:26,592 --> 00:10:28,527
CARS HAVE TRIED TO MOVE TO THE 

295
00:10:28,527 --> 00:10:30,262
SIDE TO CREATE A PATHWAY FOR 

296
00:10:30,262 --> 00:10:33,765
FIRST RESPONDERS TO GET THROUGH.

297
00:10:33,765 --> 00:10:36,202
THIS IS I5 DURING RUSH HOUR.

298
00:10:36,202 --> 00:10:38,337
IT'S A MAJOR CORRIDOR LEADING 

299
00:10:38,337 --> 00:10:39,605
FROM THE BORDER WITH MEXICO TO 

300
00:10:39,605 --> 00:10:44,609
THE BORDER WITH CANADA. 

301
00:10:44,609 --> 00:10:47,513
>> WE'RE RIGHT NEAR TACO MA, 

302
00:10:47,513 --> 00:10:50,448
WASHINGTON AND SEATTLE. 

303
00:10:50,448 --> 00:10:54,119
>> DAVID KERLEY, WE CAN SEE 

304
00:10:54,119 --> 00:10:55,788
AMTRAK CASS KADS.

305
00:10:55,788 --> 00:10:57,523
WHAT DOES THAT TELL YOU?

306
00:10:57,523 --> 00:11:00,326
>> THAT'S THE SERVICE.

307
00:11:00,326 --> 00:11:02,995
IT RUNS FROM VANCOUVER DOWN 

308
00:11:02,995 --> 00:11:05,030
THROUGH SEATTLE AND PORTLAND AND

309
00:11:05,030 --> 00:11:07,032
GOES THROUGH OTHER CITY NESS 

310
00:11:07,032 --> 00:11:07,733
OREGON.

311
00:11:07,733 --> 00:11:10,936
THE CASCADE MOUNTAINS RUN NORTH 

312
00:11:10,936 --> 00:11:11,136
SOUTH.

313
00:11:11,136 --> 00:11:14,206
THEY RUN THE WEST SIDE OF THE 

314
00:11:14,206 --> 00:11:15,407
CASCADE MOUNTAINS.

315
00:11:15,407 --> 00:11:17,142
GEORGE, IT'S WAY TOO EARLY TO 

316
00:11:17,142 --> 00:11:18,377
TALK ABOUT WHAT ACTUALLY CAUSED 

317
00:11:18,377 --> 00:11:18,577
THIS.

318
00:11:18,577 --> 00:11:23,248
AS I MENTIONED EARLIER, COULD IT

319
00:11:23,248 --> 00:11:24,350
HAVE BEEN SOMETHING AT A 

320
00:11:24,350 --> 00:11:29,522
CROSSING WE'RE NOT SEEING OR WAS

321
00:11:29,522 --> 00:11:30,623
IT SOMETHING THAT HAPPENED WITH 

322
00:11:30,623 --> 00:11:33,058
THE TRAIN GOING TOO FAST OR WAS 

323
00:11:33,058 --> 00:11:35,628
IT SOMETHING WITH THE RAILS.

324
00:11:35,628 --> 00:11:38,130
SO FAR FEDERAL OFFICIALS TELLING

325
00:11:38,130 --> 00:11:39,865
US THEY HAVE NO INDICATION THIS 

326
00:11:39,865 --> 00:11:40,866
COULD BE TERRORISM RELATED.

327
00:11:40,866 --> 00:11:43,302
I HAVE TO TELL YOU JUST A COUPLE

328
00:11:43,302 --> 00:11:44,837
WEEKS AGO WE DID A STORY ABOUT 

329
00:11:44,837 --> 00:11:49,575
THE FACT THAT IN THE LATEST 

330
00:11:49,575 --> 00:11:54,012
"INSPIRE" MAGAZINE FROM AL 

331
00:11:54,012 --> 00:11:55,948
QUAEDA THE COVER STORY WAS 

332
00:11:55,948 --> 00:11:57,550
SUGGESTING TERRORIST DERAIL 

333
00:11:57,550 --> 00:11:58,918
TRAINS.

334
00:11:58,918 --> 00:11:59,552
FEDERAL AUTHORITIES SAID THEY 

335
00:11:59,552 --> 00:12:01,086
HAVE NO INDICATION OF THIS.

336
00:12:01,086 --> 00:12:02,821
IT IS SOMETHING THAT LOCAL, 

337
00:12:02,821 --> 00:12:04,790
FEDERAL AUTHORITIES, AMTRAK AND 

338
00:12:04,790 --> 00:12:06,292
THE FREIGHT RAIL PEOPLE ARE 

339
00:12:06,292 --> 00:12:07,193
CONCERNED ABOUT.

340
00:12:07,193 --> 00:12:11,730
WE HAVE A COUPLE HUNDRED 

341
00:12:11,730 --> 00:12:13,832
THOUSANDS MILES OF RAIL LINE 

342
00:12:13,832 --> 00:12:16,969
MUCH IS UNSECURED AND SECURED, 

343
00:12:16,969 --> 00:12:17,536
UNSECURED.

344
00:12:17,536 --> 00:12:18,971
IT'S A PROBLEM THAT THEY'RE 

345
00:12:18,971 --> 00:12:19,304
LOOKING AT. 

346
00:12:19,304 --> 00:12:21,273
>> DAVID, THANKS.

347
00:12:21,273 --> 00:12:28,814
I WANT TO BRING IN GREG MAKAI 

348

UNDARE PASS WE CAME TO A STOP 

353
00:12:38,790 --> 00:12:42,794
TRYING TO AVOID COLLIDING INTO 

354
00:12:42,794 --> 00:12:43,796
ONE ANOTHER.

355
00:12:43,796 --> 00:12:45,497
WE SAW THE TRAIN CAME OFF THE 

356
00:12:45,497 --> 00:12:48,300
TRACK ON TO THE FREEWAY HANGING 

357
00:12:48,300 --> 00:12:48,500
THERE.

358
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:50,703
LOTS OF FOLKS INCLUDING A LOT OF

359
00:12:50,703 --> 00:12:52,905
GOOD MILITARY PERSONNEL RAN TO 

360
00:12:52,905 --> 00:12:55,241

DOWN?

364
00:12:59,245 --> 00:13:00,445
BY THE TIME YOU SAW WHAT 

365
00:13:00,445 --> 00:13:02,114
HAPPENED THE TRAIN WAS DOWN?

366
00:13:02,114 --> 00:13:03,048
>> RIGHT.

367
00:13:03,048 --> 00:13:07,185
WE WERE FOCUSSED ON NOT RUNNING 

368
00:13:07,185 --> 00:13:08,487
INTO ONE ANOTHER.

369
00:13:08,487 --> 00:13:11,223
WHEN WE LOOKED UP, SMOKE 

370
00:13:11,223 --> 00:13:11,790
EVERYWHERE.

371
00:13:11,790 --> 00:13:13,391
EVERYONE WAS CURIOUS HAPPENED. 

372

00:13:16,128 --> 00:13:18,397
PASSENGERS ON THAT CAR THAT WAS

HANGING OFF THE BRIDGE?

375
00:13:21,901 --> 00:13:23,435
>> FROM WHERE I WAS, NO.

376
00:13:23,435 --> 00:13:24,836
THERE'S NO WAY TO SEE IF 

377
00:13:24,836 --> 00:13:26,505
ANYTHING WAS IN IT.

378
00:13:26,505 --> 00:13:28,173
HONESTLY IT'S THE FIRST TIME 

379
00:13:28,173 --> 00:13:29,808
I'VE EVER SEEN A PASSENGER TRAIN

380
00:13:29,808 --> 00:13:31,110
ON THAT TRACK.

381
00:13:31,110 --> 00:13:34,947
IT RUNS PARALLEL TO I5 GOING 

382
00:13:34,947 --> 00:13:35,581
SOUTH THERE.

383
00:13:35,581 --> 00:13:38,316
IT WAS A SURPRISE TO SEE IT.

384
00:13:38,316 --> 00:13:39,718
THERE WAS NOBODY COMING OUT OF 

385
00:13:39,718 --> 00:13:41,619
THE TRAIN AFTER THE INCIDENT. 

386
00:13:41,619 --> 00:13:43,489
>> YOU DIDN'T HEAR ANYTHING 

387
00:13:43,489 --> 00:13:46,425
BEFORE THE TRAIN CAME DOWN 

388
00:13:46,425 --> 00:13:46,658
EITHER?

389
00:13:46,658 --> 00:13:48,159
>> NO, I DIDN'T HEAR ANYTHING. 

390
00:13:48,159 --> 00:13:52,197
>> HOW ABRUPTLY DID THIS ALL 

391
00:13:52,197 --> 00:13:53,165
HAPPEN?

392
00:13:53,165 --> 00:13:54,400
HOW ABRUPTLY DID YOU HAVE TO 

393
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:54,767
STOP?

394
00:13:54,767 --> 00:13:58,437
>> IT WAS SLAMMING ON THE BREAKS

395
00:13:58,437 --> 00:14:00,572
AND SWERVING TO THE SIDE OF THE 

396
00:14:00,572 --> 00:14:01,941
ROAD TO AVOID ONE ANOTHER.

397
00:14:01,941 --> 00:14:05,010
IT'S WET AND WINDY HERE TODAY IN

398
00:14:05,010 --> 00:14:05,310
WASHINGTON. 

399
00:14:05,310 --> 00:14:07,780
>> AS FAR AS YOU CAN TELL, WERE 

400
00:14:07,780 --> 00:14:09,315
THERE ANY TRAFFIC ACCIDENTS IN 

401
00:14:09,315 --> 00:14:10,783
ADDITION TO WHAT HAPPENED WITH 

402
00:14:10,783 --> 00:14:12,518
THE TRAIN?

403
00:14:12,518 --> 00:14:15,020
>> NO, NOT FROM JUST NORMAL 

404
00:14:15,020 --> 00:14:16,922
TRAFFIC OR ANYBODY TRYING TO 

405
00:14:16,922 --> 00:14:17,122
STOP.

406
00:14:17,122 --> 00:14:19,692
I THINK EVERYTHING -- THEY ACTED

407
00:14:19,692 --> 00:14:21,727
PRETTY WELL TO AVOID ONE 

408
00:14:21,727 --> 00:14:21,960
ANOTHER.

409
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:23,695
THE TRAIN DID APPEAR TO COME 

410
00:14:23,695 --> 00:14:25,030
INTO CONTACT WITH VEHICLES ON 

411
00:14:25,030 --> 00:14:25,864
THE FREEWAY. 

412
00:14:25,864 --> 00:14:27,899
>> YOU SAID YOU SAW MILITARY 

413
00:14:27,899 --> 00:14:29,267
RESPONDERS AND OTHERS RUSH 

414
00:14:29,267 --> 00:14:30,569
QUICKLY TO THE SCENE.

415
00:14:30,569 --> 00:14:34,273
WHAT EXACTLY WERE THEY DOING?

416
00:14:34,273 --> 00:14:36,375
>> THEY WERE FOLKS THAT -- THEY 

417
00:14:36,375 --> 00:14:38,510
LOOKED LIKE THEY WERE JUST DONE 

418
00:14:38,510 --> 00:14:40,879
WITH THEIR PHYSICAL MORNING.

419
00:14:40,879 --> 00:14:44,817
THEY WERE IN THAT AYE TIRE.

420
00:14:44,817 --> 00:14:46,352
THEY WERE GRABBING ANYTHING THEY

421
00:14:46,352 --> 00:14:49,355
COULD, TOWELS, FIRST AID KITS.

422
00:14:49,355 --> 00:14:53,692
I DID MY BEST TO STAY OUT OF THE

423
00:14:53,692 --> 00:14:53,959
WAY.

424
00:14:53,959 --> 00:14:56,795
I'M NOT SKILLED IN THAT MANNER. 

425
00:14:56,795 --> 00:14:58,697
>> DID YOU SEE ANY INJURED ON 

426
00:14:58,697 --> 00:15:00,265
THE GROUND?

427
00:15:00,265 --> 00:15:02,201
>> I DIDN'T SEE ANY INJURED FROM

428
00:15:02,201 --> 00:15:03,435
MY VANTAGE POINT WHEN I FIRST 

429
00:15:03,435 --> 00:15:04,703
GOT THERE.

430
00:15:04,703 --> 00:15:06,138
AS I WAS STUCK IN TRAFFIC DUE TO

431
00:15:06,138 --> 00:15:08,474
THE EMERGENCY VEHICLES -- THEY 

432
00:15:08,474 --> 00:15:11,043
WERE BRINGING FOLKS OUT ON 

433
00:15:11,043 --> 00:15:12,010
STRETCHERS AND BACK BOARDS. 

434
00:15:12,010 --> 00:15:15,013
>> SO YOU DEFINITELY SEE PEOPLE 

435
00:15:15,013 --> 00:15:18,150
WHO WERE INJURED AND MAYBE 

436
00:15:18,150 --> 00:15:24,022
SERIOUSLY BEING TAKEN FROM THE 

437
00:15:24,022 --> 00:15:24,690
SCENE?

438
00:15:24,690 --> 00:15:25,457
>> SABSOLUTELY. 

439
00:15:25,457 --> 00:15:26,992
>> WHERE ARE YOU NOW?

440
00:15:26,992 --> 00:15:29,628
>> THEY TURNED US AROUND AND 

441
00:15:29,628 --> 00:15:30,629
HEADING HOME.

442
00:15:30,629 --> 00:15:33,665
I'M ON MY HANDS FREE DEVICE. 

443
00:15:33,665 --> 00:15:35,501
>> THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

444
00:15:35,501 --> 00:15:37,402
IT'S IMPORTANT INFORMATION.

445
00:15:37,402 --> 00:15:39,471
I WANT TO GO BACK TO DAVID.

446
00:15:39,471 --> 00:15:41,339
DAVID, ONE OF THE THINGS WE'RE 

447
00:15:41,339 --> 00:15:42,741
LEARNING IS THE TRAIN WAS 

448
00:15:42,741 --> 00:15:47,446
RUNNING DOWN A NEW BYPASS.

449
00:15:47,446 --> 00:15:49,415
DO WE HAVE ANY IDEA HOW FAST THE

450
00:15:49,415 --> 00:15:50,582
TRAIN WAS GOING?

451
00:15:50,582 --> 00:15:52,584
>> WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO CONFIRM 

452
00:15:52,584 --> 00:15:55,754
FROM AM TRAM'S REAL TIME 

453
00:15:55,754 --> 00:15:59,391
TRACKING IT WAS TRAVELING AT 81 

454
00:15:59,391 --> 00:16:00,092
MILES AN HOUR.

455
00:16:00,092 --> 00:16:01,527
DEPENDING ON THE PIECE OF TRACK 

456
00:16:01,527 --> 00:16:02,861
THAT'S NOT NECESSARILY SPEEDING 

457
00:16:02,861 --> 00:16:05,764
OR GOING OVER THE LIMIT.

458
00:16:05,764 --> 00:16:06,898
SO THAT -- 

459
00:16:06,898 --> 00:16:09,401
>> WHAT SPEED DO THEY GENERALLY 

460
00:16:09,401 --> 00:16:10,502
TRAVEL AT?

461
00:16:10,502 --> 00:16:12,304
>> BECAUSE THESE TRACKS -- YOU 

462
00:16:12,304 --> 00:16:14,206
KNOW WE BUILT THESE TRACKS A 

463
00:16:14,206 --> 00:16:15,641
LONG TIME AGO.

464
00:16:15,641 --> 00:16:16,908
BECAUSE THEY HAVE CURVES AT 

465
00:16:16,908 --> 00:16:23,281
TIMES YOU'VE SEEN IT, THERE ARE 

466
00:16:23,281 --> 00:16:26,318
TIMES THEY HAVE TO SLOW DOWN 

467
00:16:26,318 --> 00:16:28,320
BECAUSE OF CURVES.

468
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:30,288
IF THEY HAVE A STRAIGHT LINE 

469
00:16:30,288 --> 00:16:33,958
THEY CAN GO 80 OR 90 MILES AN 

470
00:16:33,958 --> 00:16:35,127
HOUR.

471
00:16:35,127 --> 00:16:35,927
THAT DOESN'T SUGGEST IT WAS 

472
00:16:35,927 --> 00:16:37,696
GOING TOO FAST.

473
00:16:37,696 --> 00:16:39,832
GEORGE, YOU MENTIONED THE CASS 

474
00:16:39,832 --> 00:16:40,065
KADS.

475
00:16:40,065 --> 00:16:41,967
YOU CAN SEE THAT OUTSIDE OF THE 

476
00:16:41,967 --> 00:16:43,869
AMTRAK RAIL CAR.

477
00:16:43,869 --> 00:16:47,138
THE COLORING AND PAINT SCHEME IS

478
00:16:47,138 --> 00:16:50,742
HARKENING BACK -- I'M USING SOME

479
00:16:50,742 --> 00:16:53,679
OF MY OLD TIME MODEL TRAINS.

480
00:16:53,679 --> 00:16:57,182
THOSE WERE THE COLORS USED FOR 

481
00:16:57,182 --> 00:16:59,184
TRAINS IN THE PACIFIC NORTHWEST 

482
00:16:59,184 --> 00:17:00,018
100 YEARS AGO.

483
00:17:00,018 --> 00:17:01,586
THIS IS A THROW BACK OF THIS 

484
00:17:01,586 --> 00:17:06,657
SERVICE THAT RUNS ALONG THE CASS

485
00:17:06,657 --> 00:17:08,393
KADS ON THE WEST SIDE BETWEEN 

486
00:17:08,393 --> 00:17:11,863
PORTLAND AND UP TO VANCOUVER. 

487
00:17:11,863 --> 00:17:14,965
>> THIS TRAIN LEFT SEATTLE AND 

488
00:17:14,965 --> 00:17:19,204
WAS SCHEDULED TO ARRIVE IN 

489
00:17:19,204 --> 00:17:19,737
POR

490
00:17:19,737 --> 00:17:22,540
PORTLAND AROUND 9:00 A.M.

491
00:17:22,540 --> 00:17:24,742
I WANT TO BRING IN PIERRE 

492
00:17:24,742 --> 00:17:24,976
THOMAS.

493
00:17:24,976 --> 00:17:30,448
WE KNOW THE NATIONAL 

494
00:17:30,448 --> 00:17:35,720
TRANSPORTATION SAFETY BOARD IS 

495
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:36,054
INVESTIGATING.

496
00:17:36,054 --> 00:17:39,758
HAVE THE FBI PICKED UP ANY 

497
00:17:39,758 --> 00:17:40,058
INFORMATION?

498
00:17:40,058 --> 00:17:43,795
>> GEORGE, IT'S NOT UNUSUAL WHEN

499
00:17:43,795 --> 00:17:46,198
THERE'S NO CLEAR CAUSE FOR THE 

500
00:17:46,198 --> 00:17:48,901
FBI TO ASSIST THE NTSB TO TRY TO

501
00:17:48,901 --> 00:17:49,968
FIND OUT WHAT HAPPENED.

502
00:17:49,968 --> 00:17:51,002
BECAUSE OF WHAT HAPPENED, THE 

503
00:17:51,002 --> 00:17:53,805
LEVEL OF THIS EVENT, THE FEDERAL

504
00:17:53,805 --> 00:17:55,139
AUTHORITIES WILL BE CURIOUS TO 

505
00:17:55,139 --> 00:17:56,775
KNOW WHAT HAPPENED AND THEY WILL

506
00:17:56,775 --> 00:17:59,044
OFFER SUPPORT, GEORGE. 

507
00:17:59,044 --> 00:18:00,412
>> NO INDICATION YET THIS WAS 

508
00:18:00,412 --> 00:18:03,749
ANYTHING OTHER THAN AN ACCIDENT.

509
00:18:03,749 --> 00:18:05,250
NO INDICATION THERE WAS 

510
00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:06,818
TERRORISM RELATED OR 

511
00:18:06,818 --> 00:18:11,190
DELIBERATELY INSPIRED?

512
00:18:11,190 --> 00:18:11,823
>> THAT'S CORRECT, GEORGE.

513
00:18:11,823 --> 00:18:14,193
WE'LL CONTINUE TO CHECK WITH OUR

514
00:18:14,193 --> 00:18:15,394
SOURCES THROUGHOUT THE MORNING.

515
00:18:15,394 --> 00:18:17,929
LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICIALS WILL 

516
00:18:17,929 --> 00:18:21,399
BE AVAILABLE IF NEEDED. 

517
00:18:21,399 --> 00:18:26,104

518
00:18:26,104 --> 00:18:26,404
DERAILMENT.

519
00:18:26,404 --> 00:18:28,607

PORTLAND AMTRAK 501.

521
00:18:30,609 --> 00:18:32,210
YOU SEE THAT CAR DANGLING OFF 

522
00:18:32,210 --> 00:18:36,281
THE OVERPASS INTO THE HIGHWAY, 

523
00:18:36,281 --> 00:18:36,682
