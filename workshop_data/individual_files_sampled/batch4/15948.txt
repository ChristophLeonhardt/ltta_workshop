but one of our most popular guess is my friend many Montenegrin know a former senior partner of a national law firm and a candid visor to former Prime Minister Stephen Harper he now has his own think tank called Fink Sharpe where he's the president and he's one of my favorite people to follow on chatter because he brings a lawyers mind to the BS of political and public life and I'm delighted to have Manny back on now to talk about the Toronto shooting Manny welcome back to the show Thank You Israel glad to be here well you know what I like is you approach the news like a lawyer in cross-examination you look at the words you look at people wiggling around and you ask clear questions and I'm a fan Manny and I tell you your segments on trade and the NAFTA battle have gone viral I'd like to bring in your expertise on the Toronto shooting of course it's a tragedy an 18 year old girl and a 10 year old girl murdered more than a dozen others injured and we don't want to rush to judgment before the facts are out but what's been frustrating to me Manning is how the media seems to want to stop the facts from coming out bury the facts spin the facts because it looks like it was an Isis terrorist attack that's what it looks like as of when we're taping this you know Isis has claimed responsibility the man's name is flies insane known to police etc I'd like your thoughts on this whole story Manny well I spent 32 years cross-examining experts and and and to do so you always have to start with the premise I don't accept what you are going to say I don't accept your expertise and you've got to learn to question and that's all I do on Twitter it started with me the very first thing and I thought it was very concerning to me why is the new minister bill Blair I in Toronto why was he sent there it is not a border issue and it is not a organized crime issue that's his new portfolio and I found it very odd the bill bear was there holding court with the mayor and the Chief of Police of Toronto now if you recall bill Blair was the ex Chief of Police why was he there and that was a bit so that started the questioning and then I questioned why did it take 24 hours to name the the the perpetrator the killer why did the press release come at the same time as naming the murderer you talking about his release that was purport not a family a family but it was it turns out it was written by a Muslim political activist affiliated with care can so and that was kept that was kept hidden to where I actually wrote the thing there were a lot of curious details sorry I interrupted you man you keep going yeah no so so when when those backs started popping up it just seemed irregular it seemed improper so then you start looking for more and asking more questions and the more questions I asked on Twitter the more I became concerned I I must say I didn't think that it was looked like it was orchestrated there are too many hands involved in in not having the right story out that got me concerned and and and and and so I asked for questions and then as I asked questions a day or so later we find out the truth that the family is connected to a lot of violence the brother is in fact his brothers in fact was a drug dealer knows a good friend that has access to guns so there's a lot of information that of course wasn't in the press release and of course wasn't given to the public so it got me concerned and then you ask yourself what is the overarching point why is this happening and there has to be a broader sense of I mean people don't conspire to do things unless there's a broader purpose and the broader purpose is to give a message and I think that's what concerns me and the message is be damned to the innocent victims that were killed be damned to the people that were injured be damned to the truth let's a message out there to keep people happy and that's when I became very concerned yeah you know I think the facts are coming out slowly but surely the fact that they were sort of a pause on releasing the key detail that the identity of the the killer these days when I see that my spider senses start tingling I'm thinking if the name is released quickly we know what the facts are but if it is known to police and withheld these days it makes me think perhaps a jihadist they don't want a Muslim sounding name to be released because politicians are trying to tamp this down and that seems to be what's going on here the fact that like you mentioned contemporaneously the same moment the name was released a pre-written well-sculpted you know well the argument was presented by a Muslim activist but the fact it was written by him as captain see there's just too many shenanigans well it's think you think at the time he took I mean first of all the the killer was known to the police he's had two interactions with the police the killers brother is known to the police so at the moment of the time that the killer was shot and and and and they knew who he was why the delay and then you you have to ask yourself to craft a document like that and I have crafted documents like that it takes first of all you've got to contact the individual the family or someone and I'd like to know who contacted the individual certainly let the family the family doesn't have the presence of mind when they when their son has committed murders to sit there and say oh I'm gonna call an expert someone called that expert for them right who'd who called them because I know I mean I think of my time as an immigrant like he's from familiy my father my mother they could hardly even know who anybody was of any expertise so who called them how long did it take him to get there how long did he produce did he even talk to the parents did he even know so that must have taken hours to produce and that was what the delay was and why were the government officials cooperating with the delay to get this press release oh because they knew who the the the murderer was they certainly knew the family but there was this conspiracy of creating a narrative that in my view and Ezra here's what upsets me the most I mean I've seen politics and I've seen the worst of worse and the best of best but there's this beautiful ten-year-old girl that was killed and and and you know I have a beautiful daughter that and I remember when she was ten years old and to have these people forget that victim to get to drive a narrative breaks my heart and I'm very upset and I'm I'm distraught with what's happened I want to know every detail as to why the delay who caused of the way how would it work out but you know I don't think we're gonna get that information yeah and not only have those real victims being forgotten but the CBC in particular and the Toronto Star has tried to rebrand the terrorist as you know he tried to humanize him the CBC really said he had a million-dollar smile the CBC said he was humble and polite that doesn't look to be true not I mean but the fact is well I mean I mean that all doesn't matter I mean if you know everyone has a positive human side and everyone and this person had an evil side I'm not interested in that person I'm not interested I'm only interested in that the innocent daughter as our the story that broke my heart and I don't know if your if you if your followers have read it but the father and daughter were having an ice cream cone right the father was shot and the daughter was tried the daughter was sent to the Children's Hospital the father went to another hospital in Toronto and I'm not familiar it might be st. Mike's they were nowhere near it the they told the father that the daughter was going to die the ambulance took him from his spot at his hospital to his daughters to hold his her hand while she died that is Ezra there is nothing more vile and sinister to have now perpetrated this false narrative over this poor family I tell you there is nothing that breaks my heart more when I heard that story and she is forgotten he's forgotten and the only interested of what I'll call the liberal bias media and the government officials is to drive this narrative this Muslim narratives which is which is trampling on this poor father and daughter's lives it just breaks my heart yeah you know I think this is a national story in some ways if that if they claimed by Isis that this was an Isis terrorist is true and we've seen police reports that Faisal has sayings online activities came to their attention so that seems to lend some credence to it Isis is not saying they directed it Isis is right he was inspired by them because they they really want do-it-yourself people who were watch the videos and get revved up and so they they're not claiming they ordered the hit from Iraq or Syria but they're saying he was inspired by them that rings true and yet our Prime Minister is still on vacation in BC Monday Tuesday Wednesday every day if you look at his official calendar on his website it says personal day he hasn't broken off his sand castle vacation to even make a public appearance a public statement if this were george w bush and hurricane katrina it could be almost a career ender I haven't seen a single mainstream journalist even mainstream media cbc toronto star journalist even mentioned the Trudeau's a wall yeah I know I don't judge Justin Trudeau with George W Bush I judge him for himself yeah when there was that false fake hijab story and it was that a minor incident if it were true and it was proven to be false Justin Trudeau tweeted and not only did he tweet within hours but he tweeted the victim's name who she was not a victim it was all perpetrator it's all fraud here we have another innocent girl ten years old killed and no tweet no heartfelt discussion about her on holidays ignoring so I judge Justin Trudeau the prime minister Trudeau to his own standards if he did not do that that tweet with that fake hijab story and move within hours and here day have gone by and he's done nothing I judge him to his action much like we do with with what's what we did with his girl thing incident he speaks virtuous about about about his feminism I vote the me to movement but when it comes to himself he doesn't act and that's the same so we've got a pattern here and the pattern is in almost everything he does many I want to ask you one last question about journalism we've been trying our best to cover this story at the rebel I mean we're a small operation where we don't have hundreds of staff like the CBC but I think we've been doing a good job it's a great job well thank you David Menzies is being great and I've but we're small outfit the Toronto Sun has been very good anthony fury broke the news about who actually wrote that family's letter fragile Warmington broke the news about Faisal Husseini links to Isis and a possible trip to Afghanistan and Pakistan so let me give full credit to the Toronto Sun but so much of the rest of the media Manning has not only been a part of this narrative building operation but they've actually criticized Anthony fury suanne Levy and Joe Warmington of the Sun and of course they hate us at the rebel so what's strange to me man I mean I'm not looking for praise from my competitors and rivals but for them to focus their rage at us and a Jill Warmington for for trying to cover the news that to me gives away their game these journalists a lot more range for us than they do for the terrorists exactly and and what I'm surprised about is why am I not being contacted by any other media I have listed really reasonable questions that really put the issue to test right from the beginning I'm not contacted I've been proven right on the eshop story the ballsy shot and I've been proven right on this I asked detailed questions I get attacked for asking the questions this is a country where you're supposed to be asking questions you're supposed to be and and I'm saddened that the media itself is they want a narrative everyone moves to the same narrative and investigative journalism is dead the only place you see it mamie is on Twitter and certainly with you I mean I mean and what do you do with someone who investigates you try to you try to diminish him you try to destroy them that's what happens to me I ask simple questions and the Liberals attack me I'm saying I'm just asking a question and the same happens with you and Ezra it's very clear if you could knock Ezra and rubble out then there is a one voice one non investigative journalism in Canada and and and we become much closer to those countries we deplore like North Korea and and Russia we need to have people asking questions from all sides and I'm dismayed that the media doesn't even ask the questions and you know the like the question as to who created the press release the family press release how long did it take who penned it who called the person was it immediate person that called this this the the person that did the press release like that's important to know if the family didn't even know who he was that's an alarming fact why don't we know that yeah yeah we still don't know that well Manny it's great to talk with you I hope we keep in touch and I thank you for questions you're always welcome on the rebel I appreciate your who what why where when approach that's journalism and we're glad to have you
