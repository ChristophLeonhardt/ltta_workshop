currently in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the middle of deep</font>

00:00:06,420 --> 00:00:08,820
conditioning my fellow naturals you know

4
00:00:08,820 --> 00:00:12,269
what that means um so I'm behind on<font color="#CCCCCC"> veda</font>

5
00:00:12,269 --> 00:00:16,560
again no surprise there<font color="#E5E5E5"> but we're going</font>

6
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:19,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">to go back and do the last few Vedas the</font>

7
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:21,750
<font color="#CCCCCC">Vedas we're going to cover today are if</font>

8
00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:23,130
I was<font color="#CCCCCC"> on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the Olympic Committee what</font>

9
00:00:23,130 --> 00:00:25,680
sport would i add and the next<font color="#E5E5E5"> one</font>

10
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:28,439
something I'm still angry about and also

11
00:00:28,439 --> 00:00:31,949
<font color="#E5E5E5">for today vlogging like it's 2003 so</font>

12
00:00:31,949 --> 00:00:33,200
we're gonna start<font color="#E5E5E5"> with the most</font>

13
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:35,309
depressing one first you can probably

14
00:00:35,309 --> 00:00:37,350
hear<font color="#E5E5E5"> my dog panting in the background I</font>

15
00:00:37,350 --> 00:00:39,890
just took her out for the<font color="#E5E5E5"> day but</font>

16
00:00:39,890 --> 00:00:41,700
starting with the<font color="#E5E5E5"> most depressing one</font>

17
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:43,500
first the thing I'm still<font color="#E5E5E5"> angry about is</font>

18
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:47,820
definitely more the thing I'm so angry

19
00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:49,050
about is definitely the Trayvon Martin

20
00:00:49,050 --> 00:00:52,440
case um was i surprised by the verdict

21
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:56,219
no<font color="#E5E5E5"> I wasn't surprised but it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> still hurt</font>

22
00:00:56,219 --> 00:00:59,609
just as much I think for me<font color="#E5E5E5"> as an</font>

23
00:00:59,609 --> 00:01:04,049
african-american it hurt because you

24
00:01:04,049 --> 00:01:06,840
know I love this country I love being an

25
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:10,650
african-american and i love the ideals

26
00:01:10,650 --> 00:01:13,920
of this country being that you can no

27
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:16,409
matter where you're from supposedly you

28
00:01:16,409 --> 00:01:19,979
can you know start from nothing and make

29
00:01:19,979 --> 00:01:22,380
something of yourself and do it

30
00:01:22,380 --> 00:01:25,200
completely on your own and whether

31
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:26,640
you're born into royalty or not that

32
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:29,250
doesn't matter you can be anything and

33
00:01:29,250 --> 00:01:31,740
everything that you want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be here as</font>

34
00:01:31,740 --> 00:01:34,320
long as you are honest and good hearted

35
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:40,079
and you know work hard and as an

36
00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:43,290
african-american seeing that case

37
00:01:43,290 --> 00:01:47,340
unfolded um it hurt me because while I

38
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:49,290
do feel that we as a country have come

39
00:01:49,290 --> 00:01:54,180
so far it was also just a blatant

40
00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:57,360
reminder of how far we<font color="#E5E5E5"> still have to go</font>

41
00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:02,759
and what I made it you know more

42
00:02:02,759 --> 00:02:04,860
considerably harder for me was realizing

43
00:02:04,860 --> 00:02:07,829
that you know the<font color="#E5E5E5"> potential that my</font>

44
00:02:07,829 --> 00:02:09,369
future<font color="#E5E5E5"> son</font>

45
00:02:09,369 --> 00:02:13,390
might is going to have to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be taught to</font>

46
00:02:13,390 --> 00:02:15,980
<font color="#CCCCCC">presents himself in a certain way all</font>

47
00:02:15,980 --> 00:02:18,860
the time that<font color="#E5E5E5"> maybe his fellow friends</font>

48
00:02:18,860 --> 00:02:21,470
of other races will not have to think

49
00:02:21,470 --> 00:02:23,060
about well think not even<font color="#E5E5E5"> think twice</font>

50
00:02:23,060 --> 00:02:25,909
about and having that conversation with

51
00:02:25,909 --> 00:02:30,170
my hispanic husband was tough because it

52
00:02:30,170 --> 00:02:32,480
basically made him realize<font color="#CCCCCC"> that there</font>

53
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:34,970
are things that our<font color="#E5E5E5"> future children are</font>

54
00:02:34,970 --> 00:02:37,040
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> rely on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> me to teach</font>

55
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:40,010
them as an african-american because nine

56
00:02:40,010 --> 00:02:41,870
times out of ten they will<font color="#E5E5E5"> probably look</font>

57
00:02:41,870 --> 00:02:47,049
more of<font color="#E5E5E5"> african descent than hispanic so</font>

58
00:02:47,049 --> 00:02:49,010
you know that<font color="#CCCCCC"> was a tough conversation</font>

59
00:02:49,010 --> 00:02:50,599
to have with my husband too and<font color="#E5E5E5"> i think</font>

60
00:02:50,599 --> 00:02:51,500
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> really put things into perspective</font>

61
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:55,310
for him as well um you know being in an

62
00:02:55,310 --> 00:02:58,340
interracial relationship so yeah that

63
00:02:58,340 --> 00:03:00,409
verdict really hurt and it's gonna hurt

64
00:03:00,409 --> 00:03:04,519
for some time<font color="#CCCCCC"> I think it's it's um it'll</font>

65
00:03:04,519 --> 00:03:07,450
be<font color="#E5E5E5"> interesting to see the aftermath</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

66
00:03:07,450 --> 00:03:10,370
the verdicts<font color="#E5E5E5"> long-term aftermath I mean</font>

67
00:03:10,370 --> 00:03:13,519
the immediate aftermath has been you

68
00:03:13,519 --> 00:03:16,370
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> interesting but it'll be</font>

69
00:03:16,370 --> 00:03:17,959
interesting to see the long-term effects

70
00:03:17,959 --> 00:03:20,150
of what this trial means for this

71
00:03:20,150 --> 00:03:22,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">country so that's what I'm still mad</font>

72
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:24,949
about and yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's not going away</font>

73
00:03:24,949 --> 00:03:28,220
anytime soon so we got rid<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the very</font>

74
00:03:28,220 --> 00:03:29,599
<font color="#E5E5E5">very sad one that's why I wanted to do</font>

75
00:03:29,599 --> 00:03:30,889
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> one first to get it out of the way</font>

76
00:03:30,889 --> 00:03:33,079
I hate I just get<font color="#E5E5E5"> the bad news out of</font>

77
00:03:33,079 --> 00:03:36,799
the way first um the second one if I

78
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:38,980
were part of the Olympic Committee mmm

<font color="#CCCCCC">sit here and try to explain the rules to</font>

82
00:03:45,889 --> 00:03:50,750

it would<font color="#E5E5E5"> be fun but see i would add</font>

84

up a flying broom but we make that

88
00:04:04,819 --> 00:04:06,409
<font color="#CCCCCC">happen quick so that Quidditch can be a</font>

89
00:04:06,409 --> 00:04:08,629
real sport because that would<font color="#CCCCCC"> be super</font>

90
00:04:08,629 --> 00:04:12,019
exciting and I would totally watch that

96
00:04:29,980 --> 00:04:33,100
most was go to the movies because
