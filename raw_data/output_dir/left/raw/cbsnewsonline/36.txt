35
00:01:02,729 --> 00:01:03,530
IMPORTANT ANNOUNCEMENT 

36
00:01:03,530 --> 00:01:05,230
REGARDING THE PRESIDENT'S 

37
00:01:05,230 --> 00:01:06,699
DECISION TO TERMINATE THE 1955 

38
00:01:06,699 --> 00:01:08,668
TREATY OF AMITY WITH IRAN, A 

39
00:01:08,668 --> 00:01:12,338
TREATY IRAN MADE A MOCKERY OF 

40
00:01:12,338 --> 00:01:15,041
WITH ITS SUPPORT FOR TERRORISM, 

41
00:01:15,041 --> 00:01:15,775
PROVOCATIVE BALLISTIC MISSILE 

42
00:01:15,775 --> 00:01:16,843
PROLIFERATION AND MALINED

00:01:16,843 --> 00:01:18,311
BEHAVIOR -- MA LINED BEHAVIOR 

44
00:01:18,311 --> 00:01:18,878
THROUGHOUT THE MIDDLE EAST. 

45
00:01:18,878 --> 00:01:19,412
TODAY'S DECISION BY THE 

46
00:01:19,412 --> 00:01:20,713
INTERNATIONAL COURT OF JUSTICE 

47
00:01:20,713 --> 00:01:22,815
WAS A DEFEAT FOR IRAN. 

48
00:01:22,815 --> 00:01:24,317
IT CORRECTLY REJECTED NEARLY 

49
00:01:24,317 --> 00:01:26,319
ALL OF IRAN'S REQUESTS, BUT WE 

50
00:01:26,319 --> 00:01:27,887
ARE DISAPPOINTED THAT THE 

51
00:01:27,887 --> 00:01:29,789
I.C.J. 

52
00:01:29,789 --> 00:01:30,857
FAILED TO RECOGNIZE THAT IT HAS 

53
00:01:30,857 --> 00:01:33,092
NO JURISDICTION TO ISSUE ANY 

54
00:01:33,092 --> 00:01:34,861

55
00:01:34,861 --> 00:01:35,928

00:01:38,565 --> 00:01:39,532
SECURITY UNDER THE TREATY. 

58
00:01:39,532 --> 00:01:41,968
INSTEAD THE COURT ALLOWED IRAN 

59
00:01:41,968 --> 00:01:46,739
TO USE IT AS A FORM FOR 

60
00:01:46,739 --> 00:01:47,039
PROPAGANDA. 

61
00:01:47,039 --> 00:01:48,508
THE IRANIAN REGIME HAS 

62
00:01:48,508 --> 00:01:49,609
SYSTEMICALLY PURSUED A POLICY 

63
00:01:49,609 --> 00:01:50,944
OF HOSTILITY TOWARDS THE UNITED 

64
00:01:50,944 --> 00:01:52,078

66
00:01:55,914 --> 00:01:57,217
THE REGIME CANNOT PRACTICE 

67
00:01:57,217 --> 00:01:59,886
ANIMOSITY IN ITS CONDUCT AND 

68
00:01:59,886 --> 00:02:02,956
THEN ASK FOR AMITY UNDER 

69
00:02:02,956 --> 00:02:03,389
INTERNATIONAL LAW. 

70
00:02:03,389 --> 00:02:04,958

OUR ACTIONS TODAY ARE

TREATY WITH NICARAGUA. 

106
00:03:04,484 --> 00:03:06,886
IT IS ALSO CONSISTENT WITH THE 

107
00:03:06,886 --> 00:03:08,655

THOSE BECAUSE WE WANT TO 

157
00:04:29,969 --> 00:04:31,104
EMPHASIZE THE STEPS THAT THE 

158

REGIME, IT HAS BEEN A THREAT 

163

THE CENTRAL BANKER OF

00:04:50,923 --> 00:04:51,557

HOSTILE AND AGGRESSIVE MILITARY 

170
00:04:52,892 --> 00:04:55,328
BEHAVIOR IN THE REGION TODAY IS 

171
00:04:55,328 --> 00:04:57,330

00:05:35,168 --> 00:05:35,735
INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY TO 

188
00:05:35,735 --> 00:05:36,402
BEING A ROGUE STATE, OUR 

189
00:05:36,402 --> 00:05:37,970
DISPUTE HAS NEVER BEEN WITH THE 

190
00:05:37,970 --> 00:05:39,539
PEOPLE OF IRAN. 

191
00:05:39,539 --> 00:05:41,674
WE ONLY WISH THEY HAD THE 

192
00:05:41,674 --> 00:05:42,809
ABILITY TO CONTROL THEIR OWN 

193
00:05:42,809 --> 00:05:43,142
GOVERNMENT. 

194
00:05:43,142 --> 00:05:44,343
>>REPORTER:  AND THEN ON THE 

195
00:05:44,343 --> 00:05:44,776
INTERSECTION PART? 

196
00:05:44,776 --> 00:05:48,848
>> NO, IT WON'T HAVE ANY EFFECT 

197
00:05:48,848 --> 00:05:49,215
ON THAT. 

198
00:05:49,215 --> 00:05:49,415
SIR. 

199
00:05:49,415 --> 00:05:50,750
>>REPORTER:  MR. AMBASSADOR, 

200
00:05:50,750 --> 00:05:51,350
CANCELING THOSE TWO TREATIES, 

201
00:05:51,350 --> 00:05:54,954
I'M TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT 

202
00:05:54,954 --> 00:05:56,421
ARE THE OPEN PATH FOR POTENTIAL 

203
00:05:56,421 --> 00:05:59,459
TALKS YOU STILL HAVE WITH IRAN 

204
00:05:59,459 --> 00:06:00,092
AND ACTUALLY THE PALESTINIANS? 

205
00:06:00,092 --> 00:06:01,060
>> THIS IS REALLY -- THIS 

206
00:06:01,060 --> 00:06:04,397
REALLY HAS LESS TO DO WITH IRAN 

207
00:06:04,397 --> 00:06:06,833
AND THE PALESTINIANS THAN WITH 

208
00:06:06,833 --> 00:06:08,267
THE CONTINUED CONSISTENT POLICY 

209
00:06:08,267 --> 00:06:10,603
OF THE UNITED STATES TO REJECT 

210
00:06:10,603 --> 00:06:11,770
THE JURISDICTION OF THE 

211
00:06:11,770 --> 00:06:14,540
INTERNATINAL COURT OF JUSTICE 

212
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:15,441
WHICH WE THINK IS POLITICIZED 

213
00:06:15,441 --> 00:06:15,875
AND INEFFECTIVE. 

214
00:06:15,875 --> 00:06:18,177
IT RELATES OBVIOUSLY IN PART TO 

215
00:06:18,177 --> 00:06:19,879
OUR VIEWS ON THE INTERNATIONAL 

216
00:06:19,879 --> 00:06:24,283
CRIMINAL COURT AND THE NATURE 

217
00:06:24,283 --> 00:06:24,783
OF SO-CALLED PURPORTED 

218
00:06:24,783 --> 00:06:26,118
INTERNATIONAL COURTS TO BE ABLE 

219
00:06:26,118 --> 00:06:27,019
TO BIND THE UNITED STATES. 

220
00:06:27,019 --> 00:06:27,219
SIR. 

221
00:06:27,219 --> 00:06:28,321
>>REPORTER:  IT IS CLOSING 

222
00:06:28,321 --> 00:06:28,988
DOORS IN THE END. 

223
00:06:28,988 --> 00:06:30,456
YOU WON'T BE ABLE TO -- 

224
00:06:30,456 --> 00:06:32,658
>> IT'S CLOSING DOORS THAT 

225
00:06:32,658 --> 00:06:33,759
SHOULDN'T BE OPEN TO 

226
00:06:33,759 --> 00:06:35,795
POLITICIZED ABUSE WHICH IS WHAT 

227
00:06:35,795 --> 00:06:37,429
WE'VE CONSISTENTLY SEEN IN THE 

228
00:06:37,429 --> 00:06:38,831
I.C.J. 

229
00:06:38,831 --> 00:06:39,031
JOHN. 

230
00:06:39,031 --> 00:06:41,300
>>REPORTER:  THANK YOU, MR. 

231
00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:41,600
AMBASSADOR. 

232
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:46,305
AS YOU KNOW, YESTERDAY THE 

233
00:06:46,305 --> 00:06:47,473
FRENCH GOVERNMENT DENOUNCED THE 

234
00:06:47,473 --> 00:06:49,242
IRANIAN GOVERNMENT OR A TERROR 

235
00:06:49,242 --> 00:06:52,945
PLOT IN PARIS AGAINST THE 

236
00:06:52,945 --> 00:06:54,881
NATIONAL COUNCIL OF IRANIAN 

237
00:06:54,881 --> 00:06:56,482
RESISTANCE, LEADING GROUP 

238
00:06:56,482 --> 00:06:57,015
OPPOSING THE AYATOLLAHS. 

239
00:06:57,015 --> 00:06:57,750
YOU'RE AWARE -- WAS THAT A 

240
00:06:57,750 --> 00:07:00,753
FACTOR IN ANY OF THE DECISION 

241
00:07:00,753 --> 00:07:02,522
THAT YOU'VE MADE WITHDRAWING 

242
00:07:02,522 --> 00:07:03,089
FROM THESE TWO PROTOCOLS? 

243
00:07:03,089 --> 00:07:03,322
>> NO. 

244
00:07:03,322 --> 00:07:04,123
THESE DECISIONS WERE MADE 

245
00:07:04,123 --> 00:07:06,759
BEFORE WE WERE AWARE OF THE 

246
00:07:06,759 --> 00:07:07,159
FRENCH DECISION. 

247
00:07:07,159 --> 00:07:10,096
BUT I HAVE TO SAY WHAT THE 

248
00:07:10,096 --> 00:07:13,666
FRENCH HAVE DONE IS EXACTLY THE 

249
00:07:13,666 --> 00:07:14,367
RIGHT THING. 

250
00:07:14,367 --> 00:07:16,669
THEY ARRESTED AND OTHER 

251
00:07:16,669 --> 00:07:19,872
EUROPEAN GOVERNMENTS ARRESTED 

252
00:07:19,872 --> 00:07:22,008
ACCREDITED IRANIAN DIPLOMATS, 

253
00:07:22,008 --> 00:07:23,342
ACCREDITED IRANIAN DIPLOMATS 

254
00:07:23,342 --> 00:07:26,813
FOR CONSPIRACY TO CONDUCT THIS 

255
00:07:26,813 --> 00:07:28,547
ATTEMPTED ASSAULT ON THE RALLY 

256
00:07:28,547 --> 00:07:28,847
IN PARIS. 

257
00:07:28,847 --> 00:07:30,583
SO THAT TELLS YOU I THINK 

258
00:07:30,583 --> 00:07:31,784
EVERYTHING YOU NEED TO KNOW 

259
00:07:31,784 --> 00:07:35,788
ABOUT HOW THE GOVERNMENT OF 

260
00:07:35,788 --> 00:07:37,290
IRAN VIEWS ITS RESPONSIBILITIES 

261
00:07:37,290 --> 00:07:38,524
IN CONNECTION WITH DIPLOMATIC 

262
00:07:38,524 --> 00:07:40,793
RELATIONS, AND I HOPE IT'S A 

263
00:07:40,793 --> 00:07:42,094
WAKEUP CALL ACROSS EUROPE TO 

264
00:07:42,094 --> 00:07:46,399
THE NATURE OF THE REGIME AND 

265
00:07:46,399 --> 00:07:47,600
THE THREAT THAT THEY POSE. 

266
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:47,833
MA'AM. 

267
00:07:47,833 --> 00:07:49,335
>>REPORTER:  ARE THESE ACTIONS 

268
00:07:49,335 --> 00:07:50,703
RAMPING UP TENSIONS BETWEEN THE 

269
00:07:50,703 --> 00:07:51,370
UNITED STATES AND IRAN? 

270
00:07:51,370 --> 00:07:53,773
AND WHAT IS OUR INTELLIGENCE 

271
00:07:53,773 --> 00:07:55,508
WHEN IT COMES TO THEIR SYSTEMS 

272
00:07:55,508 --> 00:07:57,076
THERE, THEIR NUCLEAR WEAPONS, 

273
00:07:57,076 --> 00:07:58,077
ET CETERA, AT THIS MOMENT? 

274
00:07:58,077 --> 00:08:00,813
>> WELL, I'M NOT GOING TO GET 

275
00:08:00,813 --> 00:08:03,182
INTO WHAT OUR INTELLIGENCE 

276
00:08:03,182 --> 00:08:06,686
STATES, BUT THE ISSUE IS 

277
00:08:06,686 --> 00:08:07,753
PROTECTING THE UNITED STATES 

278
00:08:07,753 --> 00:08:10,756
AGAINST THE POLITICIZED USE OF 

279
00:08:10,756 --> 00:08:12,124
THESE INTERNATIONAL 

280
00:08:12,124 --> 00:08:12,457
INSTITUTIONS. 

281
00:08:12,457 --> 00:08:14,193
AS I'VE SAID, THIS GOES BACK 

282
00:08:14,193 --> 00:08:15,661
NOW CLOSE TO OVER 30 YEARS 

283
00:08:15,661 --> 00:08:20,333
REALLY IN CONNECTION WITH U.S. 

284
00:08:20,333 --> 00:08:21,334
POLICY OF REJECTING 

285
00:08:21,334 --> 00:08:21,934
JURISDICTION OF THESE COURTS, 

286
00:08:21,934 --> 00:08:23,002
AND IT'S A CONTINUATION I THINK 

287
00:08:23,002 --> 00:08:26,072
IN THE INTEREST OF THE AMERICAN 

288
00:08:26,072 --> 00:08:26,372
PEOPLE. 

289
00:08:26,372 --> 00:08:27,773
>>REPORTER:  SO DOES THIS 

290
00:08:27,773 --> 00:08:31,443
PROVIDE ANY KIND OF ATTEMPT TO 

291
00:08:31,443 --> 00:08:34,480
TRY TO COME TOGETHER ON WHAT 

292
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:35,715
WAS TRYING TO WORK WITH THEM IN 

293
00:08:35,715 --> 00:08:36,015
CLOSING -- 

294
00:08:36,015 --> 00:08:38,484
>> THEY'RE BRINGING A LAWSUIT 

295
00:08:38,484 --> 00:08:39,818
AGAINST US IN IN THE I.C.J., IT 

296
00:08:39,818 --> 00:08:42,255
HAS NOTHING WHATEVER TO DO WITH 

297
00:08:42,255 --> 00:08:43,456
A DIPLOMATIC EFFORT TO RESOLVE 

298
00:08:43,456 --> 00:08:43,856
OUR DIFFERENCES. 

299
00:08:43,856 --> 00:08:45,924
IT WAS A POLITICIZED USE OF THE 

300
00:08:45,924 --> 00:08:48,027
COURT THAT EXACERBATED THE USE 

301
00:08:48,027 --> 00:08:48,560
OF THE DIFFERENCES. 

302
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:48,794
MA'AM. 

303
00:08:48,794 --> 00:08:50,830
>>REPORTER:  CAN YOU RESPOND TO 

304
00:08:50,830 --> 00:08:52,131
THE IRANIAN FOREIGN MINISTER 

305
00:08:52,131 --> 00:08:53,933
THAT THE U.S. IS DRIVEN BY 

306
00:08:53,933 --> 00:08:54,300
REGIME CHANGE? 

307
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:55,801
>> I'LL SAY IT AGAIN, MAYBE 

308
00:08:55,801 --> 00:08:56,569
LISTEN THIS TIME. 

309
00:08:56,569 --> 00:08:58,037
OUR POLICY IS NOT REGIME 

310
00:08:58,037 --> 00:08:59,839
CHANGE, BUT WE DO EXPECT 

311
00:08:59,839 --> 00:09:01,574
SUBSTANTIAL CHANGE IN THEIR 

312
00:09:01,574 --> 00:09:01,874
BEHAVIOR. 

313
00:09:01,874 --> 00:09:04,076
THAT'S WHY THE PRESIDENT HAS 

314
00:09:04,076 --> 00:09:06,646
DIRECTED ALL OF US IN THE 

315
00:09:06,646 --> 00:09:09,015
GOVERNMENT TO COME UP WITH 

316
00:09:09,015 --> 00:09:10,983
STEPS TO REIMPOSE THE ECONOMIC 

317
00:09:10,983 --> 00:09:12,685
SANCTIONS AND TO DO WHATEVER 

318
00:09:12,685 --> 00:09:15,855
ELSE IS NECESSARY TO ENSURE WE 

319
00:09:15,855 --> 00:09:18,924
BRING MAXIMUM PRESSURE ON THE 

320
00:09:18,924 --> 00:09:19,658
REGIME TO STOP ITS MALIGNED 

321
00:09:19,658 --> 00:09:21,160
BEHAVIOR ACROSS THE BOARD, NOT 

322
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:24,630
JUST IN THE NUCLEAR FIELD, BUT 

323
00:09:24,630 --> 00:09:25,063
ACROSS THE BOARD. 

324

>>REPORTER:  THE E.U. 

325
00:09:25,564 --> 00:09:26,666

PART OF THE NUCLEAR DEAL, DOES 

327
00:09:28,567 --> 00:09:30,469
IT MAKE THE UNITED STATES' 

328
00:09:30,469 --> 00:09:33,472
EFFORTS TO TRY TO FORCE IRAN TO 

329
00:09:33,472 --> 00:09:37,343
ABANDON OR AT LEAST TRY TO 

330
00:09:37,343 --> 00:09:39,245
DISMANTLE IGHTS NUCLEAR PROGRAM 

331
00:09:39,245 --> 00:09:39,845
ANY WEAKER -- ITS NUCLEAR 

332
00:09:39,845 --> 00:09:41,180
PROGRAM ANY WEAKER? 

333
00:09:41,180 --> 00:09:44,650
>> I DON'T THINK IRAN IS 

334
00:09:44,650 --> 00:09:45,751
DSMANTLING ITS NUCLEAR 

335

PROGRAM. 

336
00:09:46,018 --> 00:09:47,219
IF ANYTHING, RECENT REPORTS 

337
00:09:47,219 --> 00:09:49,722
THAT ARE PUBLIC INDICATE IT'S 

338
00:09:49,722 --> 00:09:50,289
INCREASING THEIR ACTIVITY. 

339
00:09:50,289 --> 00:09:51,223
>>REPORTER:  HOW DO YOU 

340
00:09:51,223 --> 00:09:52,625
CONVINCE YOU DON'T HAVE THE 

341
00:09:52,625 --> 00:09:52,825
E.U. 

342
00:09:52,825 --> 00:09:53,259
PARTNERS ON BOARD. 

343
00:09:53,259 --> 00:09:54,594
>> WELL, I THINK WE'RE GOING TO 

344
00:09:54,594 --> 00:09:56,062
APPLY THE MAXIMUM AMOUNTOF 

345
00:09:56,062 --> 00:09:57,863
LEVERAGE THAT WE CAN. 

346
00:09:57,863 --> 00:09:59,599
WE'RE WORKING WITH OUR EUROPEAN 

347
00:09:59,599 --> 00:10:00,866
PARTNER, THE BRITISH, THE 

348
00:10:00,866 --> 00:10:02,201
FRENCH, THE GERMANS AND THE 

349
00:10:02,201 --> 00:10:02,434
OTHERS. 

350
00:10:02,434 --> 00:10:04,570
THEY HAVE CHOSEN TO REMAIN IN 

351
00:10:04,570 --> 00:10:05,404
THE IRAN NUCLEAR DEAL. 

352
00:10:05,404 --> 00:10:06,839
BUT AS I'VE SAID TO THEM, IT 

353
00:10:06,839 --> 00:10:09,275
WAS LIKE A BOOK THAT WAS 

354
00:10:09,275 --> 00:10:10,776
WRITTEN SEVERAL DECADES AGO AND 

355
00:10:10,776 --> 00:10:11,444
THIS COUNTRY WAS SOMETHING 

356
00:10:11,444 --> 00:10:12,878
CALLED LIKE THE SIX STAGES OF 

357
00:10:12,878 --> 00:10:13,111
GRIEF. 

358
00:10:13,111 --> 00:10:15,347
FIRST YOU HAVE DENIAL, THEN YOU 

359
00:10:15,347 --> 00:10:16,849
HAVE ANGER, EVENTUALLY YOU GET 

360
00:10:16,849 --> 00:10:17,216
TO ACCEPTANCE. 

361
00:10:17,216 --> 00:10:18,350
I THINK THAT'S THE DIRECTION 

362
00:10:18,350 --> 00:10:19,684
THE EUROPEANS ARE MOVING IN. 

363
00:10:19,684 --> 00:10:24,557
I CAN TELL YOU EUROPEAN 

364
00:10:24,557 --> 00:10:25,257
COMPANIES IN DROVES ARE 

365
00:10:25,257 --> 00:10:25,958
FORESWEARING BUSINESS 

366
00:10:25,958 --> 00:10:27,526
OPPORTUNITIES IN IRAN BECAUSE 

367
00:10:27,526 --> 00:10:30,863
THEY DON'T WANT TO BE CAUGHT UP 

368
00:10:30,863 --> 00:10:33,866
IN THE PRESSURE CAMPAIGN THAT 

369
00:10:33,866 --> 00:10:34,700
WE'RE APPLYING. 

370
00:10:34,700 --> 00:10:36,569
>>REPORTER:  MR. AMBASSADOR, 

371
00:10:36,569 --> 00:10:37,336
YOU JUST ADDRESSED PALESTINE 

372
00:10:37,336 --> 00:10:39,438
AND SAID IT IS A SO-CALLED 

373
00:10:39,438 --> 00:10:39,672
STATE. 

374
00:10:39,672 --> 00:10:42,341
IS THAT LANGUAGE PRODUCTIVE IN 

375
00:10:42,341 --> 00:10:45,144
ACHIEVING THE PRESIDENT'S -- 

376
00:10:45,144 --> 00:10:46,979
BUT THE PRESIDENT RECOMMITTED 

377
00:10:46,979 --> 00:10:49,448
TO -- THE PRESIDENT IN NEW YORK 

378
00:10:49,448 --> 00:10:51,817
CITY AS YOU KNOW RECOMMITTED 

379
00:10:51,817 --> 00:10:53,986
HIS GOAL TO ACHIEVING A TWO-

380
00:10:53,986 --> 00:10:54,353
STATE SOLUTION. 

381
00:10:54,353 --> 00:10:54,753
>> THAT'S RIGHT. 

382
00:10:54,753 --> 00:10:56,989
>>REPORTER:  SO IS USING THAT 

383
00:10:56,989 --> 00:10:58,724
SORT OF LANGUAGE PRODUCTIVE IN 

384
00:10:58,724 --> 00:10:58,991
HIS GOAL? 

385
00:10:58,991 --> 00:10:59,892
>> YEAH, SURE, OF COURSE. 

386
00:10:59,892 --> 00:11:01,861
IT'S NOT A STATE NOW. 

387
00:11:01,861 --> 00:11:04,263
IT DOES NOT MEET THE CUSTOMARY 

388
00:11:04,263 --> 00:11:05,931
INTERNATIONAL LAW TEST OF 

389
00:11:05,931 --> 00:11:06,231
STATEHOOD. 

390
00:11:06,231 --> 00:11:07,900
IT DOESN'T CONTROL DEFINED 

391
00:11:07,900 --> 00:11:10,035
BOUNDARIES, IT DOESN'T FULFILL 

392
00:11:10,035 --> 00:11:10,568
THE NORMAL FUNCTIONS OF 

393
00:11:10,568 --> 00:11:10,869
GOVERNMENT. 

394
00:11:10,869 --> 00:11:11,871
THERE ARE A WHOLE HOST OF 

395
00:11:11,871 --> 00:11:13,238
REASONS WHY IT'S NOT A STATE. 

396
00:11:13,238 --> 00:11:18,544
IT COULD BECOME A STATE AS THE 

397
00:11:18,544 --> 00:11:19,745
PRESIDENT SAID, BUT THAT 

398
00:11:19,745 --> 00:11:20,946
REQUIRES DIPLOMATIC 

399
00:11:20,946 --> 00:11:22,647
NEGOTIATIONS WITH ISRAEL AND 

400
00:11:22,647 --> 00:11:23,048
OTHERS. 

401
00:11:23,048 --> 00:11:25,651
SO CALLING IT THE SO-CALLED 

402
00:11:25,651 --> 00:11:26,752
STATE OF PALESTINE DEFINES 

403
00:11:26,752 --> 00:11:28,821
EXACTLY WHAT IT HAS BEEN, A 

404
00:11:28,821 --> 00:11:31,791
POSITION THAT THE UNITED STATES 

405
00:11:31,791 --> 00:11:33,526
GOVERNMENT HAS PURSUED 

406
00:11:33,526 --> 00:11:34,860
UNIFORMLY SINCE 1988 WHEN THE 

407
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:35,895
PALESTINIAN AUTHORITY DECLARED 

408
00:11:35,895 --> 00:11:37,029
ITSELF TO BE THE STATE OF 

409
00:11:37,029 --> 00:11:37,329
PALESTINE. 

410
00:11:37,329 --> 00:11:39,799
WE DON'T RECOGNIZE IT AS THE 

411
00:11:39,799 --> 00:11:43,803
STATE OF PALESTINE, WE HAVE 

412
00:11:43,803 --> 00:11:47,873
CONSISTENTLY ACROSS DEMOCRATIC 

413
00:11:47,873 --> 00:11:52,378
AND REPUBLICAN ADMINISTRATIONS 

414
00:11:52,378 --> 00:11:54,513
OPPOSED THE ADMISSION OF 

415
00:11:54,513 --> 00:11:54,813
PALESTINE. 

416
00:11:54,813 --> 00:11:55,948
IT'S NOT A STATE. 

417
00:11:55,948 --> 00:11:57,049
>> THE I.A.E.A. 

418
00:11:57,049 --> 00:11:59,051
IS SAYING IT DOESN'T TAKE ON 

419
00:11:59,051 --> 00:12:00,753
FACE VALUE THAT NETANYAHU'S 

420
00:12:00,753 --> 00:12:03,022
CLAIMS THAT IRAN IS HARBORING A 

421
00:12:03,022 --> 00:12:04,623
SECRET ATOMIC WAREHOUSE. 

422
00:12:04,623 --> 00:12:05,924
DO YOU AGREE WITH THE ISRAELI 

423
00:12:05,924 --> 00:12:07,293
PRIME MINISTER THAT THIS SHOULD 

424
00:12:07,293 --> 00:12:11,197
-- THERE SHOULD BE AN 

425
00:12:11,197 --> 00:12:12,231
INSPECTION AND WHAT'S YOUR 

426
00:12:12,231 --> 00:12:12,965
REACTION TO THE COMMENTS? 

427
00:12:12,965 --> 00:12:14,967
>> WELL, I HAVEN'T SEEN THOSE 

428
00:12:14,967 --> 00:12:15,234
COMMENTS. 

429
00:12:15,234 --> 00:12:18,637
I WILL SAY WE HAVE BEEN -- OUR 

430
00:12:18,637 --> 00:12:23,776
INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY HAS BEEN 

431
00:12:23,776 --> 00:12:24,977
REVIEWING THE MATERIAL THAT 

432
00:12:24,977 --> 00:12:26,212
ISRAEL EXTRACTED FROM IRAN AND 

433
00:12:26,212 --> 00:12:28,914
GOING OVER IT IN QUITE SOME 

434
00:12:28,914 --> 00:12:30,482
DETAIL, AND I'LL SAY IT'S 

435
00:12:30,482 --> 00:12:31,884
EXTREMELY IMPRESSIVE, AND WE'VE 

436
00:12:31,884 --> 00:12:34,286
BEEN VERY SUPPORTIVE OF THE 

437
00:12:34,286 --> 00:12:35,287
ISRAELI EFFORT AND SUPPORTIVE 

438
00:12:35,287 --> 00:12:35,788

439
00:12:35,788 --> 00:12:38,757
TAKING NEW STEPS TO FOLLOW UP 

440
00:12:38,757 --> 00:12:38,990
ON IT. 

441
00:12:38,990 --> 00:12:42,561
THE SENATE JUST CONFIRMED A FEW

RETAIN SECURITY CONTROL OF THE 

458
00:13:11,257 --> 00:13:12,324
WEST BANK UNDER ANY WHITE HOUSE 

459
00:13:12,324 --> 00:13:12,557
PLAN. 

460
00:13:12,557 --> 00:13:13,993
IS THAT CORRECT, OR ARE YOU 

461
00:13:13,993 --> 00:13:15,794
OPEN TO A PALESTINIAN STATE 

462
00:13:15,794 --> 00:13:17,630
WITH NO SECURITY PRESENCE FROM 

463
00:13:17,630 --> 00:13:18,230
ISRAEL INSIDE THEIR BORDER? 

464
00:13:18,230 --> 00:13:21,066
>> WE'VE BEEN WORKING, AS YOU 

465
00:13:21,066 --> 00:13:23,903
WELL KNOW, ON A PEACE PLAN 

466
00:13:23,903 --> 00:13:25,170

00:15:25,157 --> 00:15:27,026
THE KITCHEN SINK AT THE JUDGE 

554
00:15:27,026 --> 00:15:28,927
WITH NO REGARD FOR THE PROCESS, 

555
00:15:28,927 --> 00:15:29,728
DECENCY OR STANDARDS. 

556
00:15:29,728 --> 00:15:31,730
THEY'RE NOT OPPOSED TO JUDGE 

557
00:15:31,730 --> 00:15:32,497
KAVANAUGH'S JUDICIAL VIEW, 

558
00:15:32,497 --> 00:15:33,499
THEY'RE LITERALLY TRYING TO 

559
00:15:33,499 --> 00:15:34,999
UNDERCUT THE VOICE OF THE 

560
00:15:34,999 --> 00:15:36,869
AMERICAN PEOPLE WHEN THEY 

561
00:15:36,869 --> 00:15:38,037
ELECTED DONALD TRUMP. 

562
00:15:38,037 --> 00:15:39,772
THEY HAVE QUESTIONED HIS 

563
00:15:39,772 --> 00:15:41,840
LEGITIMACY AND CASUALLY TOSSED 

564
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:43,742
AROUND VICIOUS ACCUSATIONS OF 

565
00:15:43,742 --> 00:15:44,709
PERJURY, ALL FALSE AND 

566
00:15:44,709 --> 00:15:44,976
BASELESS. 

567
00:15:44,976 --> 00:15:47,780
BUT NOW THEY'VE SUNK LOWER AS 

568
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:48,847
THEY SPRANG THESE 11th-HOUR 

569
00:15:48,847 --> 00:15:51,517
ACCUSATIONS AND A FULL-SCALE 

570
00:15:51,517 --> 00:15:52,117
ASSAULT ON JUDGE KAVANAUGH'S 

571
00:15:52,117 --> 00:15:52,985
INTEGRITY. 

572
00:15:52,985 --> 00:15:54,787
THIS IS A COORDINATED SMEAR 

573
00:15:54,787 --> 00:15:55,053
CAMPAIGN. 

574
00:15:55,053 --> 00:15:56,455
NO EVIDENCE, NO INDEPENDENT 

575
00:15:56,455 --> 00:15:57,022
CORROBORATION, JUST SMEARS. 

576
00:15:57,022 --> 00:15:59,391
HERE ARE JUST A FEW OF THE 

577
00:15:59,391 --> 00:15:59,792
EXAMPLES. 

578
00:15:59,792 --> 00:16:02,094
CHUCK SCHUMER SAID, AND I 

579
00:16:02,094 --> 00:16:03,729
QUOTE, THERE'S NO PRESUMPTION 

580
00:16:03,729 --> 00:16:04,296
OF INNOCENCE OR GUILT. 

581
00:16:04,296 --> 00:16:06,131
CHRIS WHO SITS ON THE COMMITTEE 

582
00:16:06,131 --> 00:16:07,833
SAID KAVANAUGH, AND I QUOTE, 

583
00:16:07,833 --> 00:16:09,901
NOW BEARS THE BURDEN OF 

584
00:16:09,901 --> 00:16:11,903
DISPROVING THESE ALLEGATIONS, 

585
00:16:11,903 --> 00:16:13,672
RATHER THAN DR. FORD AND MS. 

586
00:16:13,672 --> 00:16:13,939
RAMIREZ. 

587
00:16:13,939 --> 00:16:15,140
MAZIE HIRONO WHO ALSO SITS ON 

588
00:16:15,140 --> 00:16:18,043
THE COMMITTEE SAID THAT JUDGE 

589
00:16:18,043 --> 00:16:18,844
KAVANAUGH DOES NOT DESERVE THE 

590
00:16:18,844 --> 00:16:20,245
PRESUMPTION OF INNOCENCE 

591
00:16:20,245 --> 00:16:21,646
BECAUSE OF HIS JUDICIAL VIEWS. 

592
00:16:21,646 --> 00:16:23,482
ONE THING IS CLEAR, DEMOCRATS 

593
00:16:23,482 --> 00:16:24,883
WANT TO BLOCK KAVANAUGH AND 

594
00:16:24,883 --> 00:16:27,152
HOLD THIS SEAT OPEN UNTIL THE 

595
00:16:27,152 --> 00:16:27,519
2020 ELECTION. 

596
00:16:27,519 --> 00:16:30,422
THIS IS ABOUT POLITICS AND THIS 

597
00:16:30,422 --> 00:16:32,925
IS ABOUT POWER, PURE AND 

598
00:16:32,925 --> 00:16:33,325
1EU6R7LE. 

599
00:16:33,325 --> 00:16:35,260
AND THEY'VE DESTROYED JUDGE 

600
00:16:35,260 --> 00:16:35,793
KAVANAUGH'S REPUTATION, 

601
00:16:35,793 --> 00:16:39,064
UNDERMINED DR. FORD'S PRIVACY 

602
00:16:39,064 --> 00:16:39,965
AND TRIED TO UPEND OUR 

603
00:16:39,965 --> 00:16:41,266
TRADITIONS OF INNOCENT UNTIL 

604
00:16:41,266 --> 00:16:41,967
PROVEN GUILTY IN THE PROCESS. 

605
00:16:41,967 --> 00:16:43,569
IT'S A COMPLETE AND TOTAL 

606
00:16:43,569 --> 00:16:43,836
DISGRACE. 

607
00:16:43,836 --> 00:16:46,238
WE WILL RECEIVE AND SUBMIT THE 

608
00:16:46,238 --> 00:16:47,372
F.B.I.'S SUPPLEMENTAL 

609
00:16:47,372 --> 00:16:49,975
BACKGROUND INVESTIGATION ON HIS 

610
00:16:49,975 --> 00:16:50,542
NOMINATION TO THE SENATE. 

611

úAS L 

612
00:16:51,443 --> 00:16:52,444
KAVANAUGH DESERVES A PROMPT 

613
00:16:52,444 --> 00:16:53,979
VOTE AND WE EXPECT HIM TO GET 

614
00:16:53,979 --> 00:16:54,346
ONE. 

615
00:16:54,346 --> 00:16:56,381
AND WITH THAT I'LL TAKE YOUR 

616
00:16:56,381 --> 00:16:56,681
QUESTIONS. 

617
00:16:56,681 --> 00:16:56,881
JOHN. 

618
00:16:56,881 --> 00:16:57,783
>>REPORTER:  SARAH, THE THREE 

619
00:16:57,783 --> 00:16:59,885
PEOPLE WHO WERE MOST IMPORTANT 

620
00:16:59,885 --> 00:17:02,755
IN THIS WHOLE PROCESS ARE 

621
00:17:02,755 --> 00:17:04,056
SENATORS MURKOWSKI, COLLINS AND 

622
00:17:04,056 --> 00:17:04,289
FLAKE. 

623
00:17:04,289 --> 00:17:06,892
THIS MORNING TWO OF THOSE 

624
00:17:06,892 --> 00:17:08,527
SENATORS, FLAKE AND COLLINS 

625
00:17:08,527 --> 00:17:11,195
WERE EXTREMELY UPSET ABOUT HOW 

626
00:17:11,195 --> 00:17:11,829
THE PRESIDENT DESCRIBED 

627
00:17:11,829 --> 00:17:14,599
CHRISTINE BLASEY FORD AT THAT 

628
00:17:14,599 --> 00:17:15,099
RALLY IN MISSISSIPPI. 

629
00:17:15,099 --> 00:17:15,968
KNOWING HOW SENSITIVE THIS 

630
00:17:15,968 --> 00:17:18,837
ISSUE IS AND HOW IMPORTANT IT 

631
00:17:18,837 --> 00:17:21,573
WOULD BE IF THE F.B.I. 

632
00:17:21,573 --> 00:17:22,173
INVESTIGATION SHOWS NO OTHER 

633
00:17:22,173 --> 00:17:22,773
COMPELLING EVIDENCE TO KEEP 

634
00:17:22,773 --> 00:17:24,443
JUDGE KAVANAUGH FROM THE COURT 

635
00:17:24,443 --> 00:17:27,112
THAT THESE PEOPLE NEED TO BE 

636
00:17:27,112 --> 00:17:27,744
COMFORTABLE WITH VOTING FOR, 

637
00:17:27,744 --> 00:17:30,182
WHY DID THE PRESIDENT SAY WHAT 

638
00:17:30,182 --> 00:17:31,750
HE DID LAST NIGHT IN THE WAY 

639
00:17:31,750 --> 00:17:33,352
THAT HE SAID IT? 

640
00:17:33,352 --> 00:17:35,787
>> THE PRESIDENT WAS STATING 

641
00:17:35,787 --> 00:17:39,124
THE FACTS, AND, FRANKLY, FACTS 

642
00:17:39,124 --> 00:17:41,326
-- AND, FRANKLY, FACTS THAT 

643
00:17:41,326 --> 00:17:42,060
WERE SHOWN IN MITCHELL'S 

644
00:17:42,060 --> 00:17:42,293
REPORT. 

645
00:17:42,293 --> 00:17:44,163
THE SENATE HAS TO MAKE A 

646
00:17:44,163 --> 00:17:45,864
DECISION BASED ON THOSE FACTS 

647
00:17:45,864 --> 00:17:48,333
AND WHETHER OR NOT THEY SEEN 

648
00:17:48,333 --> 00:17:49,600
JUDGE KAVANAUGH TO BE QUALIFIED 

649
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:51,870
TO HOLD THE POSITION ON THE 

650
00:17:51,870 --> 00:17:52,237
SUPREME COURT. 

651
00:17:52,237 --> 00:17:53,205
EVERY SINGLE WORD JUDGE 

652
00:17:53,205 --> 00:17:55,107
KAVANAUGH HAS SAID HAS BEEN 

653
00:17:55,107 --> 00:17:56,175
PICKED APART, EVERY SINGLE 

654
00:17:56,175 --> 00:17:58,142
WORD, SECOND BY SECOND OF HIS 

655
00:17:58,142 --> 00:17:59,678
TESTIMONY HAS BEEN PICKED 

656
00:17:59,678 --> 00:18:01,580
APART, YET IF ANYBODY SAYS 

657
00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:03,081
ANYTHING ABOUT THE ACCUSATIONS 

658
00:18:03,081 --> 00:18:04,449
THAT HAVE BEEN THROWN AGAINST 

659
00:18:04,449 --> 00:18:06,151
THEM, THAT'S TOTALLY OFF LIMITS 

660
00:18:06,151 --> 00:18:07,119
AND OUTRAGEOUS. 

661
00:18:07,119 --> 00:18:08,554
THIS ENTIRE PROCESS HAS BEEN A 

662
00:18:08,554 --> 00:18:09,621
DISGRACE AND THE ONLY REASON 

663
00:18:09,621 --> 00:18:11,723
THAT IT'S BEEN THAT WAY IS 

664
00:18:11,723 --> 00:18:12,390
BECAUSE SENATE DEMOCRATS DIDN'T 

665
00:18:12,390 --> 00:18:14,860
DO THIS THE WAY THAT IT SHOULD 

666
00:18:14,860 --> 00:18:17,129
HAVE BEEN DONE, AND THEY CIRCUM 

667
00:18:17,129 --> 00:18:19,197
VENTED THE ENTIRE SYSTEM, AND, 

668
00:18:19,197 --> 00:18:19,864
FRANKLY, THEY'VE UNDERMINED AN 

669
00:18:19,864 --> 00:18:22,601
ENTIRE JUDICIAL BRANCH BY THE 

670
00:18:22,601 --> 00:18:26,839
WAY THEY'VE ACTED AND THE 

671
00:18:26,839 --> 00:18:27,773
INAPPROPRIATENESS THEY'VE 

672
00:18:27,773 --> 00:18:29,641
CONDUCTED THEMSELVES. 

673
00:18:29,641 --> 00:18:30,742

THING, BUT THE TONE THE 

676
00:18:33,178 --> 00:18:35,313
PRESIDENT DID IT LAST NIGHT 

677
00:18:35,313 --> 00:18:39,885

KEY SWING VOTES FOR HIS 

679
00:18:42,688 --> 00:18:42,988

IS THE PRESIDENT --

682
00:18:45,157 --> 00:18:46,592
CONFIDENT IN HIS NOMINEE, AS HE 

683
00:18:46,592 --> 00:18:47,759
STATED TIME AND TIME AGAIN, AND 

684
00:18:47,759 --> 00:18:49,795
WE EXPECT THE SENATE TO VOTE 

685
00:18:49,795 --> 00:18:51,963
AND WE HOPE THEY DO THAT SOON. 

686

FIRST, DOES THE WHITE HOUSE 

690

HAVE ANY RESPONSE TO THE 

691

BEEN BRIEFED? 

694
00:19:03,842 --> 00:19:04,776
>> THE PRESIDENT HAS CERTAINLY 

695
00:19:04,776 --> 00:19:05,844
BEEN MADE AWARE, BUT AS WE 

696
00:19:05,844 --> 00:19:08,380
STATED YESTERDAY, I WOULD REFER 

697
00:19:08,380 --> 00:19:11,383

698
00:19:11,383 --> 00:19:11,950

IF THERE'S A MEETING WE'LL LET 

707
00:19:21,727 --> 00:19:23,328
YOU KNOW, BUT AT THIS POINT 

708

TAKING PLACE IF DEMOCRATS HAD 

723

DONE THIS IN A NORMAL ORDER AND 

724
00:19:59,865 --> 00:20:01,133
NOT EXPLOITED DR. FORD AND 

725
00:20:01,133 --> 00:20:01,967
ATTACKED JUDGE KAVANAUGH IN 

726
00:20:01,967 --> 00:20:02,834
SUCH A PUBLIC MANNER. 

727
00:20:02,834 --> 00:20:06,371
ALL OF THIS COULD HAVE BEEN 

728
00:20:06,371 --> 00:20:07,105
HANDLED COMPLETELY DIFFERENTLY 

729
00:20:07,105 --> 00:20:11,476

736
00:20:17,082 --> 00:20:18,450
OUTRIGHT TAX FRAUD THROUGHOUT 

737
00:20:18,450 --> 00:20:19,685
THE '90s WITH SUSPECT TAX 

738
00:20:19,685 --> 00:20:21,353
SCHEMES AND BASICALLY GETTING 

739
00:20:21,353 --> 00:20:23,789
MORE MONEY FROM HIS PARENTS 

740
00:20:23,789 --> 00:20:26,057
THAN HE SAID IN THOUSANDS OF 

741
00:20:26,057 --> 00:20:26,458
DOCUMENTS. 

742
00:20:26,458 --> 00:20:27,258
HE REBUTTED THE STORY. 

743
00:20:27,258 --> 00:20:28,994
CAN YOU EXPLAIN WHAT'S 

744
00:20:28,994 --> 00:20:30,295
INACCURATE ABOUT THAT STORY IF 

745
00:20:30,295 --> 00:20:31,897
THERE IS ACTUALLY ANYTHING 

746
00:20:31,897 --> 00:20:32,864
THAT'S INACCURATE ABOUT IT? 

747
00:20:32,864 --> 00:20:34,399
>> IT'S A TOTALLY FALSE ATTACK 

748
00:20:34,399 --> 00:20:36,501
BASED ON AN OLD RECYCLED NEWS 

749
00:20:36,501 --> 00:20:36,734
STORY. 

750
00:20:36,734 --> 00:20:38,436
I'M NOT GOING TO SIT AND GO 

751
00:20:38,436 --> 00:20:40,505
THROUGH EVERY LINE OF A 14,000-

752
00:20:40,505 --> 00:20:40,805
WORD STORY. 

753
00:20:40,805 --> 00:20:42,107
THE ONLY THING -- I WILL SAY 

754
00:20:42,107 --> 00:20:43,675
ONE THING THE ARTICLE DID GET 

755
00:20:43,675 --> 00:20:45,544
RIGHT IS IT SHOWED THAT THE 

756
00:20:45,544 --> 00:20:46,278
PRESIDENT'S FATHER ACTUALLY HAD 

757
00:20:46,278 --> 00:20:47,779
A GREAT DEAL OF CONFIDENCE IN 

758
00:20:47,779 --> 00:20:47,979
HIM. 

759
00:20:47,979 --> 00:20:49,014
IN FACT, THE PRESIDENT BROUGHT 

760
00:20:49,014 --> 00:20:49,982
HIS FATHER INTO A LOT OF DEALS 

761
00:20:49,982 --> 00:20:52,451
AND THEY MADE A LOT OF MONEY 

762
00:20:52,451 --> 00:20:53,585
TOGETHER, SO MUCH SO, THAT HIS 

763
00:20:53,585 --> 00:20:54,853
FATHER WENT ON TO SAY THAT 

764
00:20:54,853 --> 00:20:56,521
EVERYTHING HE TOUCHED TURNED TO 

765
00:20:56,521 --> 00:20:57,022
GOLD. 

766
00:20:57,022 --> 00:20:57,555
THE PRESIDENT'S LAWYER 

767
00:20:57,555 --> 00:20:58,657
ADDRESSED SOME OF THE SPECIFIC 

768
00:20:58,657 --> 00:21:00,626
CLAIMS AND WALKED THROUGH HOW 

769
00:21:00,626 --> 00:21:03,128
THE ALLEGATIONS OF FRAUD AND 

770
00:21:03,128 --> 00:21:04,696
TAX EVASION ARE 100% FALSE AND 

771
00:21:04,696 --> 00:21:05,230
HIGHLY DEFAMATORY. 

772
00:21:05,230 --> 00:21:07,899
THERE WAS NO FRAUD OR TAX 

773
00:21:07,899 --> 00:21:08,433
EVASION BY ANYONE. 

774
00:21:08,433 --> 00:21:09,901
HE WENT ON MUCH FURTHER, AND I 

775
00:21:09,901 --> 00:21:12,704
WOULD ENCOURAGE YOU TO READ 

776
00:21:12,704 --> 00:21:14,806
EVERY WORD OF HIS STATEMENT 

777
00:21:14,806 --> 00:21:15,574
WHICH COMPLETELY UNDERCUTS THE 

778
00:21:15,574 --> 00:21:17,576
ACCUSATIONS MADE BY THE "NEW 

779
00:21:17,576 --> 00:21:17,909
YORK TIMES." 

780
00:21:17,909 --> 00:21:19,311
>>REPORTER:  THE PRESIDENT'S 

781
00:21:19,311 --> 00:21:19,911
TAXES STILL UNDER AUDIT? 

782
00:21:19,911 --> 00:21:22,814
>> I KNOW THAT A NUMBER OF HIS 

783
00:21:22,814 --> 00:21:23,915
TAXES ARE STILL UNDER AUDIT. 

784
00:21:23,915 --> 00:21:25,684
>>REPORTER:  FROM THE '90s AND 

785
00:21:25,684 --> 00:21:25,984
THE 2000s? 

786
00:21:25,984 --> 00:21:29,354
>> I'LL HAVE TO GET BACK TO 

787
00:21:29,354 --> 00:21:29,554
YOU. 

788
00:21:29,554 --> 00:21:32,224
>>REPORTER:  IS HE RELEASING 

789
00:21:32,224 --> 00:21:33,358
ANY OF HIS TAX RETURNS? 

790
00:21:33,358 --> 00:21:34,426
>> I'M NOT AWARE OF ANY. 

791
00:21:34,426 --> 00:21:35,827
>>REPORTER:  IT WAS JUST A WEEK 

792
00:21:35,827 --> 00:21:36,795
AGO THAT PRESIDENT TRUMP CALLED 

793
00:21:36,795 --> 00:21:41,600
CHRISTINE BLASEY FORD A VERY 

794
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:42,667
CREDIBLE WITNESS, VERY 

795
00:21:42,667 --> 00:21:43,267
CREDIBLE, VERY COMPELLING. 

796
00:21:43,267 --> 00:21:44,269
NOW HE'S BASICALLY MAKING HER 

797
00:21:44,269 --> 00:21:46,505
OUT TO BE A LIAR, SO WHICH IS 

798
00:21:46,505 --> 00:21:46,671
IT? 

799
00:21:46,671 --> 00:21:47,873
>> CERTAINLY THE TESTIMONY BY 

800
00:21:47,873 --> 00:21:49,007
DR. FORD WAS COMPELLING, BUT 

801
00:21:49,007 --> 00:21:50,909
YOU CAN'T MAKE THIS DECISION 

802
00:21:50,909 --> 00:21:51,342
BASED ON EMOTION. 

803
00:21:51,342 --> 00:21:54,613
IT HAS TO BE BASED ON FACT. 

804
00:21:54,613 --> 00:21:56,548
THEY HAVE TO DETERMINE WHAT THE 

805
00:21:56,548 --> 00:21:57,248
FACTS ARE OF THIS CASE. 

806
00:21:57,248 --> 00:21:59,718
THAT'S ONE OF THE REASONS THAT 

807
00:21:59,718 --> 00:22:01,386
THEY ASKED AND BEGGED FOR THE 

808
00:22:01,386 --> 00:22:01,619
F.B.I. 

809
00:22:01,619 --> 00:22:03,088
AND DELAYED A HEARING VOTE IS 

810
00:22:03,088 --> 00:22:04,756
SO THEY COULD GET MORE FACTS ON 

811
00:22:04,756 --> 00:22:05,056
THIS CASE. 

812
00:22:05,056 --> 00:22:06,057
WE EXPECT THE F.B.I. 

813
00:22:06,057 --> 00:22:07,893
TO TURN THOSE FACTS OVER TO THE 

814
00:22:07,893 --> 00:22:10,295
SENATE AND THEY CAN MAKE A 

815
00:22:10,295 --> 00:22:10,895
DETERMINATION BASED ON THAT. 

816
00:22:10,895 --> 00:22:11,496
THAT'S ALL WE'RE ASKING FOR. 

817
00:22:11,496 --> 00:22:13,732
>>REPORTER:  YOU SAID THAT HE 

818
00:22:13,732 --> 00:22:15,400
WAS STATING THE FACTS OF AT 

819
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:16,268
THAT CAMPAIGN RALLY, BUT THIS 

820
00:22:16,268 --> 00:22:19,804
WAS SO MUCH MORE THAN STATING 

821
00:22:19,804 --> 00:22:21,273
THE FACTS. 

822
00:22:21,273 --> 00:22:22,540
THIS WAS A FULL-SCALE CAMPAIGN 

823
00:22:22,540 --> 00:22:24,776
RALLY ASSAULT ON A WOMAN WHO 

824
00:22:24,776 --> 00:22:27,345
SAYS SHE'S THE VICTIM OF SEXUAL 

825
00:22:27,345 --> 00:22:27,612
ASSAULT. 

826
00:22:27,612 --> 00:22:30,348
WHAT DO YOU GET OUT OF THAT? 

827
00:22:30,348 --> 00:22:31,983
IS THAT TO HELP KAVANAUGH'S 

828
00:22:31,983 --> 00:22:32,283
NOMINATION? 

829
00:22:32,283 --> 00:22:33,084
IS THIS TO RALLY THE BASE? 

830
00:22:33,084 --> 00:22:34,953
IS THIS GOING TO HELP WITH THE 

831
00:22:34,953 --> 00:22:35,720
MIDTERMS? 

832
00:22:35,720 --> 00:22:38,356
LIKE WHAT'S THE POINT IN DOING 

833
00:22:38,356 --> 00:22:38,556
THAT? 

834
00:22:38,556 --> 00:22:39,858
>> AGAIN, I DISPUTE THAT IT 

835
00:22:39,858 --> 00:22:41,359
WASN'T ANYTHING OTHER THAN THE 

836
00:22:41,359 --> 00:22:42,894
PRESIDENT STATING FACTS. 

837
00:22:42,894 --> 00:22:44,963
IN FACT, FACTS THAT WERE LAID 

838
00:22:44,963 --> 00:22:46,031
OUT IN THE PROSECUTOR'S MEMO 

839
00:22:46,031 --> 00:22:47,265
THAT SHE PUT FORWARD TO THE 

840
00:22:47,265 --> 00:22:47,666
SENATE. 

841
00:22:47,666 --> 00:22:48,900
EACH OF THE THINGS THAT HE 

842
00:22:48,900 --> 00:22:50,535
CALLED OUT WERE THINGS THAT 

843
00:22:50,535 --> 00:22:52,804
WERE LAID OUT IN THAT MEMO. 

844
00:22:52,804 --> 00:22:53,538
>>REPORTER:  THANKS, SARAH. 

845
00:22:53,538 --> 00:22:54,706
THERE IS CONFLICTING FEELINGS 

846
00:22:54,706 --> 00:22:56,475
ON CAPITOL HILL RIGHT NOW OVER 

847
00:22:56,475 --> 00:22:57,275
WHETHER THE F.B.I. 

848
00:22:57,275 --> 00:22:57,808
INVESTIGATION INTO JUDGE 

849
00:22:57,808 --> 00:22:59,377
KAVANAUGH SHOULD BE MADE PUBLIC 

850
00:22:59,377 --> 00:22:59,945
OR NOT. 

851
00:22:59,945 --> 00:23:01,446
DOES THE WHITE HOUSE COMMIT TO 

852
00:23:01,446 --> 00:23:04,382
TRANSPARENCY ON THIS EFFORT AND 

853
00:23:04,382 --> 00:23:06,084
LET THE AMERICAN PEOPLE SEE THE 

854
00:23:06,084 --> 00:23:07,452
FULL REIGN OF THIS 

855
00:23:07,452 --> 00:23:09,321
INVESTIGATION REGARDLESS OF THE 

856
00:23:09,321 --> 00:23:09,654
FINDINGS? 

857
00:23:09,654 --> 00:23:10,922
>> LOOK, WE'VE BEEN VERY OPEN 

858
00:23:10,922 --> 00:23:11,957
AND TRANSPARENT THROUGH THE 

859
00:23:11,957 --> 00:23:12,224
PROCESS. 

860
00:23:12,224 --> 00:23:15,127
THE PRESIDENT IS THE ONE THAT 

861
00:23:15,127 --> 00:23:15,594
ORDERED THE F.B.I. 

862
00:23:15,594 --> 00:23:17,329
INVESTIGATION TO TAKE PLACE AND 

863
00:23:17,329 --> 00:23:18,330
HAS ALLOWED THE SENATE TO 

864
00:23:18,330 --> 00:23:20,832
ACTUALLY CONTROL AND DICTATE 

865
00:23:20,832 --> 00:23:22,267
THE TERMS AND SCOPE OF THE 

866
00:23:22,267 --> 00:23:22,667
INVESTIGATION. 

867
00:23:22,667 --> 00:23:24,703
WE'RE CONTINUING TO DO THAT AND 

868
00:23:24,703 --> 00:23:25,136
ALLOWING THE F.B.I. 

869
00:23:25,136 --> 00:23:27,606
TO ACTUALLY DO IT AS THEY DO 

870
00:23:27,606 --> 00:23:28,840
BEST, AND THAT'S THEIR JOBS TO 

871
00:23:28,840 --> 00:23:29,875
DO THIS INVESTIGATION. 

872
00:23:29,875 --> 00:23:31,343
>>REPORTER:  ANOTHER QUESTION 

873
00:23:31,343 --> 00:23:32,544
FOR YOU, IF I MAY, ON 

874
00:23:32,544 --> 00:23:33,311
DECLASSIFICATION SINCE WE 

875
00:23:33,311 --> 00:23:34,545
HAVEN'T SPOKEN IN A WHILE. 

876
00:23:34,545 --> 00:23:35,580
THE PRESIDENT HAS SAID -- 

877
00:23:35,580 --> 00:23:36,681
>> YOU GUYS TOO. 

878
00:23:36,681 --> 00:23:38,583
>>REPORTER:  THE PRESIDENT SAID 

879
00:23:38,583 --> 00:23:41,253
THAT HE WOULD REFER THE 

880

DECLASSIFICATION PROCESS TO THE 

881

D.O.J. 

882

INSPECTOR GENERAL, BUT HE WANTS 

883
00:23:43,588 --> 00:23:44,622
TO SEE THAT HAPPEN QUICKLY. 

884
00:23:44,622 --> 00:23:45,457
WHAT DOES QUICKLY MEAN? 

885
00:23:45,457 --> 00:23:47,625
ARE WE GOING TO SEE THESE 

886
00:23:47,625 --> 00:23:48,292
DOCUMENTS BEFORE THE MIDTERM 

887
00:23:48,292 --> 00:23:48,593
ELECTIONS? 

888
00:23:48,593 --> 00:23:50,095
>> I'M NOT GOING TO WALK 

889
00:23:50,095 --> 00:23:51,296
THROUGH A TIMELINE, BUT WE'RE 

890
00:23:51,296 --> 00:23:52,197
CONTINUING TO WORK THROUGH THAT 

891
00:23:52,197 --> 00:23:53,665
PROCESS, AND WHEN WE HAVE AN 

892
00:23:53,665 --> 00:23:55,267
UPDATE ON IT, WE'LL CERTAINLY 

893
00:23:55,267 --> 00:23:55,600
LET YOU KNOW. 

894

EARLIER THIS YEAR MICHAEL COHEN 

897

WAS -- THIS YEAR THAT MICHAEL 

898
00:24:02,407 --> 00:24:03,875
COHEN WAS ACTING ON HIS OWN IN 

899
00:24:03,875 --> 00:24:05,377
AN ARBITRATION PROCEEDING TO 

900
00:24:05,377 --> 00:24:06,611
KEEP STORMY DANIELS FROM DOING 

901
00:24:06,611 --> 00:24:07,645
A TELEVISION INTERVIEW WHEN THE 

902
00:24:07,645 --> 00:24:08,480
PRESIDENT ACTUALLY DIRECTED 

903
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:08,813
THAT MOVE? 

904
00:24:08,813 --> 00:24:10,782
>> AS YOU KNOW, I'M NOT GOING 

905
00:24:10,782 --> 00:24:12,217
TO GET INTO A BACK AND FORTH. 

906
00:24:12,217 --> 00:24:13,385
THAT'S AN ISSUE FOR THE 

907
00:24:13,385 --> 00:24:15,053
PRESIDENT'S OUTSIDE COUNSEL. 

908
00:24:15,053 --> 00:24:19,824
I DIRECT YOU THERE TO ANSWER 

909
00:24:19,824 --> 00:24:19,990
IT.

OF THE PRESIDENT'S COMMENTS IN

MISSISSIPPI NOTWITHSTANDING, IT 

915
00:24:31,803 --> 00:24:35,273

VOTES CRITICAL TO THE

NOMINATION, ARE THERE ANY PLANS 

920
00:24:39,778 --> 00:24:41,413
FOR THE PRESIDENT TO CALL ANY 

921
00:24:41,413 --> 00:24:43,214
OF THEM BETWEEN NOW AND NEXT 

922
00:24:43,214 --> 00:24:44,615
WEEK AND MAKE ONE FINAL PITCH,

924
00:24:46,551 --> 00:24:46,951
LITTLE BIT MORE? 

925
00:24:46,951 --> 00:24:49,086
>> I'M NOT AWARE OF A SPECIFIC 

926
00:24:49,086 --> 00:24:50,121
SCHEDULED CALL, BUT WE 

927
00:24:50,121 --> 00:24:51,890
CERTAINLY HAVE BEEN IN CLOSE 

928
00:24:51,890 --> 00:24:52,724
CONTACT WITH A NUMBER OF 

929
00:24:52,724 --> 00:24:53,725

931
00:24:56,394 --> 00:24:56,627
BLAKE. 

932
00:24:56,627 --> 00:24:57,062
SORRY. 

933
00:24:57,062 --> 00:24:58,663
GO AHEAD. 

934
00:24:58,663 --> 00:25:01,066
>>REPORTER:  I WAS GOING TO ASK 

935
00:25:01,066 --> 00:25:02,200
WAS TWO OF THE PRESIDENT'S 

936
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:04,336
EARLY SUPPORTERS IN THE HOUSE 

937
00:25:04,336 --> 00:25:06,504
COLLINS OF NEW YORK AND DUNCAN 

938
00:25:06,504 --> 00:25:09,274
HUNTER OF CALIFORNIA ARE 

939
00:25:09,274 --> 00:25:09,807
RUNNING UNDER INDICTMENT. 

940
00:25:09,807 --> 00:25:11,876
THERE ARE RULES OF THE NATIONAL 

941
00:25:11,876 --> 00:25:12,844
REPUBLICAN CONGRESSIONAL 

942
00:25:12,844 --> 00:25:14,980
COMMITTEE BARRING SUPPORT FOR 

943
00:25:14,980 --> 00:25:15,513
MEMBERS WHO ARE UNDER 

944
00:25:15,513 --> 00:25:15,814
INDICTMENT. 

945
00:25:15,814 --> 00:25:16,982
DOES THE PRESIDENT STILL 

946
00:25:16,982 --> 00:25:18,182
SUPPORT BOTH OF THEM FOR RE-

947
00:25:18,182 --> 00:25:18,449
ELECTION? 

948
00:25:18,449 --> 00:25:23,255
>> I CAN'T GET INTO A LOT OF 

949
00:25:23,255 --> 00:25:23,922
DETAILS, ONE, FOR HATCH ACT 

950
00:25:23,922 --> 00:25:25,223
VIOLATION, BUT ALSO WITH AN 

951
00:25:25,223 --> 00:25:26,258
ONGOING INVESTIGATION I'M NOT 

952
00:25:26,258 --> 00:25:28,025
GOING TO BE ABLE TO COMMENT ON 

953
00:25:28,025 --> 00:25:28,326
THAT HERE. 

954
00:25:28,326 --> 00:25:30,929
>>REPORTER:  YES, SARAH, THANK 

955
00:25:30,929 --> 00:25:31,129
YOU. 

956
00:25:31,129 --> 00:25:32,931
AS THIS BRIEFING WAS BEGINNING, 

957
00:25:32,931 --> 00:25:34,532
BLOOMBERG PUT OUT AN ARTICLE 

958
00:25:34,532 --> 00:25:35,600
ABOUT THE F.B.I. 

959
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:36,668
BACKGROUND INVESTIGATION AND 

960
00:25:36,668 --> 00:25:38,036
BLOOMBERG IS REPORTING RIGHT 

961
00:25:38,036 --> 00:25:38,903
NOW THA THE F.B.I. 

962
00:25:38,903 --> 00:25:41,172
HAS AN -- HASN'T INTERVIEWED 

963
00:25:41,172 --> 00:25:42,440
JUDGE KAVANAUGH OR DR. FORD 

964
00:25:42,440 --> 00:25:44,009
BECAUSE THE WHITE HOUSE HASN'T 

965
00:25:44,009 --> 00:25:45,010
GIVEN INVESTIGATORS CLEAR 

966
00:25:45,010 --> 00:25:47,545
AUTHORITY TO DO SO. 

967
00:25:47,545 --> 00:25:48,813
IS THAT INDEED THE CASE? 

968
00:25:48,813 --> 00:25:51,783
>> AS WE'VE SAID SEVERAL TIMES, 

969
00:25:51,783 --> 00:25:53,151
THE PRESIDENT HAS INDICATED 

970
00:25:53,151 --> 00:25:54,419
THAT WHOEVER THE F.B.I. 

971
00:25:54,419 --> 00:25:55,053
DEEMS NECESSARY TO INTERVIEW 

972
00:25:55,053 --> 00:25:56,621
HE'S FINE WITH THAT, BUT HE'S 

973
00:25:56,621 --> 00:25:58,523
ALSO ASKED THAT THE SENATE BE 

974
00:25:58,523 --> 00:25:59,590
THE ONES THAT DETERMINE THE 

975
00:25:59,590 --> 00:26:00,792
SCOPE OF WHAT THEY NEED IN 

976
00:26:00,792 --> 00:26:02,961
ORDER TO MAKE A DECISION ON 

977
00:26:02,961 --> 00:26:05,530
WHETHER THEY VOTE KAVANAUGH UP 

978
00:26:05,530 --> 00:26:05,796
OR DOWN. 

979
00:26:05,796 --> 00:26:08,667
I CAN ALSO TELL YOU THAT BOTH 

980
00:26:08,667 --> 00:26:10,168
KAVANAUGH, JUDGE KAVANAUGH AND 

981
00:26:10,168 --> 00:26:13,104
DR. FORD WERE QUESTIONED IN THE 

982
00:26:13,104 --> 00:26:13,972
MOST PUBLIC WAY POSSIBLE BY THE 

983
00:26:13,972 --> 00:26:15,774
MEMBERS OF THE SENATE WHO WERE 

984
00:26:15,774 --> 00:26:18,577
ULTIMATELY THE ONES WHO HAVE TO 

985
00:26:18,577 --> 00:26:19,144
MAKE THE DETERMINATION ON 

986
00:26:19,144 --> 00:26:20,779
WHETHER OR NOT THEY VOTE FOR 

987
00:26:20,779 --> 00:26:21,179
JUDGE KAVANAUGH. 

988
00:26:21,179 --> 00:26:21,680
IF THEY HAD ADDITIONAL 

989
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:23,381
QUESTIONS FOR EITHER ONE OF 

990
00:26:23,381 --> 00:26:25,183
THEM, THEY HAD A TIME AND AN 

991
00:26:25,183 --> 00:26:25,783
OPPORTUNITY CERTAINLY TO ASK 

992
00:26:25,783 --> 00:26:26,017
THOSE. 

993
00:26:26,017 --> 00:26:27,852
>>REPORTER:  DOES THE WHOIS 

994
00:26:27,852 --> 00:26:29,053
BELIEVE IT IS APPROPRIATE THEN? 

995
00:26:29,053 --> 00:26:30,889
DOES THE WHITE HOUSE BELIEVE IT 

996
00:26:30,889 --> 00:26:31,856
IS APPROPRIATE FOR THESE TWO -- 

997
00:26:31,856 --> 00:26:33,124
>> WE'RE GOING TO ALLOW THE 

998
00:26:33,124 --> 00:26:33,357
F.B.I. 

999
00:26:33,357 --> 00:26:37,295
TO MAKE THE DETERMINATION OF 

1000
00:26:37,295 --> 00:26:37,829
THE SCOPE. 

1001
00:26:37,829 --> 00:26:39,096
>>REPORTER:  IESHA, GO AHEAD. 

1002
00:26:39,096 --> 00:26:39,731
>>REPORTER:  THANK YOU. 

1003
00:26:39,731 --> 00:26:40,832
PRESIDENT TRUMP TALKED 

1004
00:26:40,832 --> 00:26:42,300
YESTERDAY A LOT ABOUT THIS 

1005
00:26:42,300 --> 00:26:46,438
ISSUE OF BEING CONCERNED ABOUT 

1006
00:26:46,438 --> 00:26:47,806
MEN BEING GUILTY BEFORE -- 

1007
00:26:47,806 --> 00:26:49,207
BEING FOUND GUILTY BEFORE 

1008
00:26:49,207 --> 00:26:52,477
PROVEN INNOCENT AND THIS IDEA 

1009
00:26:52,477 --> 00:26:53,510
OF DUE PROCESS. 

1010
00:26:53,510 --> 00:26:54,846
BUT IN THE PAST WELFARE THE 

1011
00:26:54,846 --> 00:26:56,414
CENTRAL PARK FIVE, HE PUT OUT 

1012
00:26:56,414 --> 00:26:57,949
AN AD BASICALLY CALLING FOR THE 

1013
00:26:57,949 --> 00:26:59,217
DEATH PENALTY BEFORE THEY HAD 

1014
00:26:59,217 --> 00:27:02,220
BEEN FOUND CONVICTED AND EVEN 

1015
00:27:02,220 --> 00:27:04,089
AFTER THEY WERE EXONERATED, HE 

1016
00:27:04,089 --> 00:27:06,791
STILL BASICALLY SAID THAT THEY 

1017
00:27:06,791 --> 00:27:08,659
MAY BE GUILTY, AND EVEN AS 

1018
00:27:08,659 --> 00:27:10,395
PRESIDENT HE HAS TALKED ABOUT 

1019
00:27:10,395 --> 00:27:12,363
-- PRESIDED OVER RALLIES WHERE 

1020
00:27:12,363 --> 00:27:13,865
PEOPLE SAY LOCK HER UP TALKING 

1021
00:27:13,865 --> 00:27:15,333
ABOUT HILLARY CLINTON. 

1022
00:27:15,333 --> 00:27:16,868
SO I GUESS IS THERE A 

1023
00:27:16,868 --> 00:27:18,837
DISCONNECT BETWEEN WHEN THE 

1024
00:27:18,837 --> 00:27:20,905
PRESIDENT IS INTERESTED IN DUE 

1025
00:27:20,905 --> 00:27:22,373
PROCESS FOR SOME BUT NOT FOR 

1026
00:27:22,373 --> 00:27:23,241
OTHERS? 

1027
00:27:23,241 --> 00:27:23,875
>> NOT AT ALL. 

1028
00:27:23,875 --> 00:27:25,510
THE PRESIDENT ACTUALLY 

1029
00:27:25,510 --> 00:27:26,578
ENCOURAGED THE SENATE TO HEAR 

1030
00:27:26,578 --> 00:27:28,846
DR. FORD'S SENATE IN THE SAME 

1031
00:27:28,846 --> 00:27:31,216
WAY HE ENCOURAGED THEM TO HEAR 

1032
00:27:31,216 --> 00:27:31,649
JUDGE KAVANAUGH'S. 

1033
00:27:31,649 --> 00:27:32,650
HE IS SIMPLY STATING THE FACT 

1034
00:27:32,650 --> 00:27:34,452
THAT WE ARE A COUNTRY OF LAW 

1035
00:27:34,452 --> 00:27:36,254
AND ORDER, WE ARE A COUNTRY 

1036
00:27:36,254 --> 00:27:36,988
THAT STILL BELIEVES THAT YOU'RE 

1037
00:27:36,988 --> 00:27:38,957
INNOCENT UNTIL PROVEN GUILTY, 

1038
00:27:38,957 --> 00:27:40,425
AND WE WANT TO SEE THAT PROCESS 

1039
00:27:40,425 --> 00:27:41,793
GO THROUGH IN ITS ENTIRETY AND 

1040
00:27:41,793 --> 00:27:44,562
IT SHOULD BE ON A FAIR PLAYING 

1041
00:27:44,562 --> 00:27:44,896
FIELD. 

1042
00:27:44,896 --> 00:27:46,431
THAT'S SIMPLY THE ONLY CLAIM 

1043
00:27:46,431 --> 00:27:46,764
HE'S MAKING. 

1044
00:27:46,764 --> 00:27:48,800
>>REPORTER:  THE CRIME IS 

1045
00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:49,934
GUILTY, DOES HE FEEL THAT NOW? 

1046
00:27:49,934 --> 00:27:52,570
>> I'D HAVE TO LOOK BACK AT THE 

1047
00:27:52,570 --> 00:27:53,003
SPECIFIC COMMENTS. 

1048
00:27:53,003 --> 00:27:53,203
DAVE. 

1049
00:27:53,203 --> 00:27:53,771
>>REPORTER:  THAT'S A REAL 

1050
00:27:53,771 --> 00:27:55,673
QUESTION IN THE MIDST OF THIS. 

1051
00:27:55,673 --> 00:27:56,107
>> I'M SORRY. 

1052
00:27:56,107 --> 00:27:56,574
DAVID, GO AHEAD. 

1053
00:27:56,574 --> 00:27:57,575
>>REPORTER:  THE PRESIDENT HAS 

1054
00:27:57,575 --> 00:27:59,778
TAKEN THIS MOMENT TO SAY HE'S 

1055
00:27:59,778 --> 00:28:02,580
BEEN AFFECTED PERSONALLY BY ALL 

1056
00:28:02,580 --> 00:28:03,280
OF THESE ALLEGATIONS, AND HE'S 

1057
00:28:03,280 --> 00:28:05,382
PICKING AND CHOOSING JUST AS 

1058
00:28:05,382 --> 00:28:05,816
THE QUESTION WAS. 

1059
00:28:05,816 --> 00:28:07,886
HE SAID THE CENTRAL PARK FIVE 

1060
00:28:07,886 --> 00:28:09,387
WAS GUILTY, AND THEN HE HAS 

1061
00:28:09,387 --> 00:28:10,622
MADE BILL CLINTON GUILTY. 

1062
00:28:10,622 --> 00:28:12,157
HAS HE DECIDED TO CHANGE HIS 

1063
00:28:12,157 --> 00:28:14,125
MIND ON THE CENTRAL PARK FIVE 

1064
00:28:14,125 --> 00:28:15,292
AS THEY HAVE BEEN EXONERATED? 

1065
00:28:15,292 --> 00:28:16,528
>> IT'S INTERESTING THAT YOU 

1066
00:28:16,528 --> 00:28:18,295
BRING UP BILL CLINTON. 

1067
00:28:18,295 --> 00:28:19,697
NOBODY WANTS TO HEAR THOSE 

1068
00:28:19,697 --> 00:28:20,832
ACCUSERS' VOICES BE HEARD, BUT 

1069
00:28:20,832 --> 00:28:22,967
YOU'RE CERTAINLY HAPPY TO HEAR 

1070
00:28:22,967 --> 00:28:23,701
ALL THE OTHERS. 

1071
00:28:23,701 --> 00:28:24,135
DAVID, GO AHEAD. 

1072
00:28:24,135 --> 00:28:24,602
I'VE ADDRESSED THIS. 

1073
00:28:24,602 --> 00:28:26,137
I DON'T HAVE ANYTHING ELSE TO 

1074
00:28:26,137 --> 00:28:26,337
ADD. 

1075
00:28:26,337 --> 00:28:27,872
>>REPORTER:  IS HE STILL 

1076
00:28:27,872 --> 00:28:28,506
TALKING TO THEM? 

1077
00:28:28,506 --> 00:28:29,174
>>REPORTER:  SARAH, SEVERAL 

1078
00:28:29,174 --> 00:28:30,708
TIMES IN THE LAST WEEK THE 

1079
00:28:30,708 --> 00:28:32,877
PRESIDENT HAS TRIED TO REASSURE 

1080
00:28:32,877 --> 00:28:34,646
VOTERS THAT PROTECT PEOPLE WITH 

1081
00:28:34,646 --> 00:28:36,481
PRE-EXISTING CONDITIONS FROM 

1082
00:28:36,481 --> 00:28:37,115
LOSING THEIR HEALTH INSURANCE. 

1083
00:28:37,115 --> 00:28:39,751
DOES THAT -- IS THAT A SIGN 

1084
00:28:39,751 --> 00:28:40,384
HE'S WORRIED THAT REPUBLICANS 

1085
00:28:40,384 --> 00:28:41,653
ARE LOSING THE ARGUMENT ON 

1086
00:28:41,653 --> 00:28:42,253
HEALTHCARE IN THIS ELECTION? 

1087
00:28:42,253 --> 00:28:44,189
>> I THINK IT'S A SIGN THAT 

1088
00:28:44,189 --> 00:28:46,023
PEOPLE WANTS TO PROTECT PEOPLE 

1089
00:28:46,023 --> 00:28:46,991
WITH PRE-EXISTING HEALTH 

1090
00:28:46,991 --> 00:28:47,291
CONDITIONS. 

1091
00:28:47,291 --> 00:28:48,292
I THINK IT'S PRETTY SIMPLE. 

1092
00:28:48,292 --> 00:28:49,761
HE SAID HE SUPPORTS THAT AND HE 

1093
00:28:49,761 --> 00:28:52,263
WANTS TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT'S 

1094
00:28:52,263 --> 00:28:53,364
NOT SOMETHING THAT GETS LOST. 

1095
00:28:53,364 --> 00:28:53,665
JIM. 

1096
00:28:53,665 --> 00:28:54,899
>>REPORTER:  WE GO BACK TO THIS 

1097
00:28:54,899 --> 00:28:56,501
-- I MEAN, IT WAS PRETTY 

1098
00:28:56,501 --> 00:28:58,736
OBVIOUS THAT THE PRESIDENT WAS 

1099
00:28:58,736 --> 00:28:59,771
MOCKING CHRISTINE BLASEY FORD 

1100
00:28:59,771 --> 00:29:00,071
LAST NIGHT. 

1101
00:29:00,071 --> 00:29:01,539
HE SAID HOW DID YOU GET HOME? 

1102
00:29:01,539 --> 00:29:02,173
I DON'T REMEMBER. 

1103
00:29:02,173 --> 00:29:04,308
HOW DID YOU GET THERE? 

1104
00:29:04,308 --> 00:29:06,878
I DON'T REMEMBER. 

1105
00:29:06,878 --> 00:29:07,512
WHERE IS THIS PLACE? 

1106
00:29:07,512 --> 00:29:07,912
I DON'T REMEMBER. 

1107
00:29:07,912 --> 00:29:09,948
HE SEEMED TO BE TO THE DELIGHT 

1108
00:29:09,948 --> 00:29:12,350
OF THE CROWD THERE IN 

1109
00:29:12,350 --> 00:29:13,751
MISSISSIPPI MOCKING HER 

1110
00:29:13,751 --> 00:29:14,051
REPEATEDLY. 

1111
00:29:14,051 --> 00:29:14,853
ISN'T THERE SOMETHING WRONG 

1112
00:29:14,853 --> 00:29:16,354
WITH THE PRESIDENT OF THE 

1113
00:29:16,354 --> 00:29:17,789
UNITED STATES MOCKING SOMEBODY 

1114
00:29:17,789 --> 00:29:18,922
WHO SAYS SHE WAS SEXUALLY 

1115
00:29:18,922 --> 00:29:19,223
ASSAULTED? 

1116
00:29:19,223 --> 00:29:21,059
>> IT SEEMED TO ME THAT HE WAS 

1117
00:29:21,059 --> 00:29:23,895
STATING FACTS  THAT DR. FORD 

1118
00:29:23,895 --> 00:29:26,130
HERSELF LAID OUT IN HER 

1119
00:29:26,130 --> 00:29:26,531
TESTIMONY. 

1120
00:29:26,531 --> 00:29:27,398
ONCE AGAIN, EVERY SINGLE WORD 

1121
00:29:27,398 --> 00:29:30,268
THAT JUDGE KAVANAUGH HAS SAID 

1122
00:29:30,268 --> 00:29:30,868
HAS BEEN LOOKED AT, EXAMINED, 

1123
00:29:30,868 --> 00:29:33,071
PICKED APART BY MOST OF YOU IN 

1124
00:29:33,071 --> 00:29:34,973
THIS ROOM, BUT NO ONE IS 

1125
00:29:34,973 --> 00:29:36,441
LOOKING AT WHETHER OR NOT THE 

1126
00:29:36,441 --> 00:29:37,542
ACCUSATIONS MADE ARE 

1127
00:29:37,542 --> 00:29:39,577
CORROBORATED, WHETHER OR NOT 

1128
00:29:39,577 --> 00:29:40,445
THERE'S EVIDENCE TO SUPPORT 

1129
00:29:40,445 --> 00:29:40,645
THEM. 

1130
00:29:40,645 --> 00:29:41,980
EVERY PERSON THAT SHE NAMED HAS 

1131
00:29:41,980 --> 00:29:43,882
COME OUT AND SAID EITHER THEY 

1132
00:29:43,882 --> 00:29:46,317
DIDN'T RECALL IT OR IT DIDN'T 

1133
00:29:46,317 --> 00:29:47,185
HAPPEN OR THEY WEREN'T THERE. 

1134
00:29:47,185 --> 00:29:48,920
EVERY SINGLE BIT OF EVIDENCE 

1135
00:29:48,920 --> 00:29:50,588
AND FACTS  THAT WE'VE SEEN IN 

1136
00:29:50,588 --> 00:29:53,291
THIS MOMENT HAVE SUPPORTED 

1137
00:29:53,291 --> 00:29:54,058
JUDGE KAVANAUGH'S CASE, AND THE 

1138
00:29:54,058 --> 00:29:55,260
PRESIDENT SIMPLY POINTING OUT 

1139
00:29:55,260 --> 00:29:56,394
THE FACTS OF THE MATTER AND 

1140
00:29:56,394 --> 00:29:57,662
THAT'S WHAT THE SENATE WILL 

1141
00:29:57,662 --> 00:29:58,496
HAVE TO USE TO DETERMINE 

1142
00:29:58,496 --> 00:29:59,964
WHETHER OR NOT THEY SUPPORT HIM 

1143
00:29:59,964 --> 00:30:00,197
OR NOT. 

1144
00:30:00,197 --> 00:30:00,999
>>REPORTER:  ARE YOU SAYING 

1145
00:30:00,999 --> 00:30:03,802
JUDGE KAVANAUGH IS THE VICTIM 

1146
00:30:03,802 --> 00:30:04,169
IN ALL THIS? 

1147
00:30:04,169 --> 00:30:05,603
>> I THINK BOTH DR. FORD AND 

1148
00:30:05,603 --> 00:30:07,372
JUDGE KAVANAUGH ARE VICTIMS AT 

1149
00:30:07,372 --> 00:30:08,706
THE HANDS OF THE DEMOCRATS. 

1150
00:30:08,706 --> 00:30:10,575
I THINK IT IS ABSOLUTELY 

1151
00:30:10,575 --> 00:30:13,344
DISGRACEFUL WHAT THEY'VE DONE 

1152
00:30:13,344 --> 00:30:13,911
AND EXPLOITED THIS PROCESS. 

1153
00:30:13,911 --> 00:30:14,445
THEY EXPLOITED DR. FORD, 

1154
00:30:14,445 --> 00:30:15,379
THEY'RE EXPLOITING ALL OF THE 

1155
00:30:15,379 --> 00:30:18,116
WOMEN THAT HAVE COME OUT TO 

1156
00:30:18,116 --> 00:30:18,716
MAKE ANY TYPE OF ACCUSATION. 

1157
00:30:18,716 --> 00:30:19,884
THIS ISN'T THE PROCESS THAT 

1158
00:30:19,884 --> 00:30:21,119
SHOULD HAVE BEEN DONE, AND 

1159
00:30:21,119 --> 00:30:22,854
CERTAINLY EVERYBODY DESERVES TO 

1160
00:30:22,854 --> 00:30:23,654
BE HEARD, BUT THAT INCLUDES 

1161
00:30:23,654 --> 00:30:25,490
JUDGE KAVANAUGH, AND THAT 

1162
00:30:25,490 --> 00:30:26,590
SHOULD BE PART OF THIS PROCESS, 

1163
00:30:26,590 --> 00:30:28,226
AND THE FACTS HAVE TO BE LOOKED 

1164
00:30:28,226 --> 00:30:30,295
AT AND I THINK YOU HAVE TO LOOK 

1165
00:30:30,295 --> 00:30:30,895
AT THE PROSECUTOR'S MEMO. 

1166
00:30:30,895 --> 00:30:32,263
THOSE ARE WHERE YOU SEE ALL OF 

1167
00:30:32,263 --> 00:30:34,299
THOSE FACTS LAID OUT AND I 

1168
00:30:34,299 --> 00:30:36,334
THINK SHE MAKES A VERY 

1169
00:30:36,334 --> 00:30:36,734
COMPELLING CASE. 

1170
00:30:36,734 --> 00:30:37,168
JOHN, GO AHEAD. 

1171
00:30:37,168 --> 00:30:38,803
>>REPORTER:  YOU DON'T HAVE ANY 

1172
00:30:38,803 --> 00:30:39,270
PROBLEM DEFENDING -- 

1173
00:30:39,270 --> 00:30:41,672
>> I DON'T HAVE ANY PROBLEM 

1174
00:30:41,672 --> 00:30:42,439
STATING FACTS, NO. 

1175
00:30:42,439 --> 00:30:42,941
JOHN. 

1176
00:30:42,941 --> 00:30:43,641
>>REPORTER:  THANK YOU, SARAH. 

1177
00:30:43,641 --> 00:30:44,442
>> I KNOW THAT'S PROBABLY 

1178
00:30:44,442 --> 00:30:46,110
SOMETHING YOU DO HAVE A PROBLEM 

1179
00:30:46,110 --> 00:30:46,744
WITH, BUT I DON'T. 

1180
00:30:46,744 --> 00:30:47,612
>>REPORTER:  ACTUALLY, SARAH, 

1181
00:30:47,612 --> 00:30:48,680
WE DO STATE THE FACTS. 

1182
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:50,014
I THINK THERE HAVE BEEN MANY 

1183
00:30:50,014 --> 00:30:50,949
OCCASIONS WHERE YOU DON'T STATE 

1184
00:30:50,949 --> 00:30:52,650
THE FACTS, IF I MAY RESPOND. 

1185
00:30:52,650 --> 00:30:53,818
>> JOHN, GO AHEAD. 

1186
00:30:53,818 --> 00:30:54,819
>>REPORTER:  THANK YOU, SARAH. 

1187
00:30:54,819 --> 00:30:57,455
JUST FIVE DAYS AGO ON FRIDAY 

1188
00:30:57,455 --> 00:30:59,657
THE PRESIDENT WHEN ASKED ABOUT 

1189
00:30:59,657 --> 00:31:01,392
DR. FORD'S TESTIMONY BEFORE THE 

1190
00:31:01,392 --> 00:31:03,962
SENATE SAID THAT SHE WAS A VERY 

1191
00:31:03,962 --> 00:31:06,130
CREDIBLE WITNESS AND WE SAW A 

1192
00:31:06,130 --> 00:31:08,599
DIFFERENT TONE, A DIFFERENT 

1193
00:31:08,599 --> 00:31:10,768
SUBSTANCE LAST NIGHT IN THOSE 

1194
00:31:10,768 --> 00:31:12,236
REMARKS TO THAT CAMPAIGN RALLY 

1195
00:31:12,236 --> 00:31:13,170
AUDIENCE IN MISSISSIPPI. 

1196
00:31:13,170 --> 00:31:14,072
WHY THE CHANGE IN TONE? 

1197
00:31:14,072 --> 00:31:15,807
AND DOES THE PRESIDENT STILL 

1198
00:31:15,807 --> 00:31:18,309
BELIEVE WHAT HE SAID ON FRIDAY 

1199
00:31:18,309 --> 00:31:19,944
THAT SHE WAS A VERY CREDIBLE 

1200
00:31:19,944 --> 00:31:20,545
WITNESS? 

1201
00:31:20,545 --> 00:31:22,380
>> I'VE ADDRESSED THIS A NUMBER 

1202
00:31:22,380 --> 00:31:22,713
OF TIMES. 

1203
00:31:22,713 --> 00:31:25,249
THE PRESIDENT ALSO SAID SHE HAD 

1204
00:31:25,249 --> 00:31:26,484
A VERY COMPELLING STORY. 

1205
00:31:26,484 --> 00:31:28,453
AND NOBODY DISAGREES WITH THAT. 

1206
00:31:28,453 --> 00:31:28,720
HOLD ON. 

1207
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:29,553
>>REPORTER:  CREDIBLE -- 

1208
00:31:29,553 --> 00:31:30,888
>> NOBODY DISAGREES WITH THAT. 

1209
00:31:30,888 --> 00:31:31,889
BUT THE PRESIDENT IS SIMPLY 

1210
00:31:31,889 --> 00:31:33,958
STATING THE FACTS THAT SHE LAID 

1211
00:31:33,958 --> 00:31:35,360
OUT IN HER OWN TESTIMONY AND 

1212
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:36,527
THAT THE PROSECUTOR LAID OUT IN 

1213
00:31:36,527 --> 00:31:36,794
HER MEMO. 

1214
00:31:36,794 --> 00:31:38,096
AT THE END OF THE DAY, THE 

1215
00:31:38,096 --> 00:31:42,500
SENATE HAS TO MAKE A DECISION 

1216
00:31:42,500 --> 00:31:43,234
ON WHERE THEY STAND. 

1217
00:31:43,234 --> 00:31:43,634
TAKE ONE MORE. 

1218
00:31:43,634 --> 00:31:46,437
>>REPORTER:  DOES HE STILL -- 

1219
00:31:46,437 --> 00:31:47,472
DOES THE PRESIDENT STILL 

1220
00:31:47,472 --> 00:31:48,873
BELIEVE THAT DR. FORD'S 

1221
00:31:48,873 --> 00:31:50,274
TESTIMONY WAS CREDIBLE WHEN SHE 

1222
00:31:50,274 --> 00:31:50,975
TESTIFIED UNDER OATH? 

1223
00:31:50,975 --> 00:31:51,876
>> THE PRESIDENT BELIEVES THAT 

1224
00:31:51,876 --> 00:31:52,777
JUDGE KAVANAUGH SHOULD BE 

1225
00:31:52,777 --> 00:31:53,344
CONFIRMED. 

1226
00:31:53,344 --> 00:31:54,746
HE HAS A LOT OF CONFIDENCE IN 

1227
00:31:54,746 --> 00:31:56,614
HIM AND HE'D LIKE TO SEE A VOTE 

1228
00:31:56,614 --> 00:31:57,114
TO SEE THAT HAPPEN. 

1229
00:31:57,114 --> 00:31:58,449
>>REPORTER:  JUST A COUPLE 

1230
00:31:58,449 --> 00:31:58,749
QUESTIONS. 

1231
00:31:58,749 --> 00:31:59,751
PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS SEEMED TO 

1232
00:31:59,751 --> 00:32:03,254
LINK THE CREDIBILITY OF A CLAIM 

1233
00:32:03,254 --> 00:32:05,189
WITH HOW MUCH TIME HAS PASSED 

1234
00:32:05,189 --> 00:32:06,924
SINCE THE INDIVIDUAL MADE IT. 

1235
00:32:06,924 --> 00:32:07,892
PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS ALSO CALLED 

1236
00:32:07,892 --> 00:32:09,761
THE SEX ABUSE SCANDAL IN THE 

1237
00:32:09,761 --> 00:32:12,797
CATHOLIC CHURCH VERY SAD, BUT 

1238
00:32:12,797 --> 00:32:14,932
MANY OF THOSE VICTIMS WAITED 

1239
00:32:14,932 --> 00:32:17,401
DECADES BEFORE COMING FORWARD. 

1240
00:32:17,401 --> 00:32:19,504
WHY DOES THE PRESIDENT SEEM TO 

1241
00:32:19,504 --> 00:32:21,005
ASSUME MEN WHO ARE CLAIMING 

1242
00:32:21,005 --> 00:32:24,776
ABUSE BUT WAIT TO COME FORWARD 

1243
00:32:24,776 --> 00:32:27,945
ARE TELLING THE TRUTH BUT NOT 

1244
00:32:27,945 --> 00:32:28,178
WOMEN? 

1245
00:32:28,178 --> 00:32:30,248
>> THAT'S JUST COMPLETELY 

1246
00:32:30,248 --> 00:32:30,481
UNTRUE. 

1247
00:32:30,481 --> 00:32:32,183
THE PRESIDENT HAS SUPPORTED, 

1248
00:32:32,183 --> 00:32:34,085
AGAIN, THROUGHOUT THIS ENTIRE 

1249
00:32:34,085 --> 00:32:35,553
PROCESS DR. FORD'S ABILITY TO 

1250
00:32:35,553 --> 00:32:36,520
COME FORWARD AND TELL HER 

1251
00:32:36,520 --> 00:32:36,821
STORY. 

1252
00:32:36,821 --> 00:32:38,723
HE'S THE ONE THAT ORDERED THE 

1253
00:32:38,723 --> 00:32:39,891
F.B.I. 

1254
00:32:39,891 --> 00:32:41,225
TO DO A BACKGROUND -- FURTHER 

1255
00:32:41,225 --> 00:32:42,894
SUPPLEMENTAL BACKGROUND CHECK 

1256
00:32:42,894 --> 00:32:45,229
TO LOOK INTO EACH OF THE 

1257
00:32:45,229 --> 00:32:46,664
ACCUSATIONS AND ALLEGATIONS 

1258
00:32:46,664 --> 00:32:49,166
THAT THE SENATE DEEMS NECESSARY 

1259
00:32:49,166 --> 00:32:49,901
 

1260
00:32:49,901 --> 00:32:51,502
HE'S ALSO BEEN MORE THAN HAPPY 

1261
00:32:51,502 --> 00:32:54,872
TO GIVE A PLATFORM TO THE 

1262
00:32:54,872 --> 00:32:56,441
ACCUSERS THAT HAVE COME OUT 

1263
00:32:56,441 --> 00:32:57,041
AGAINST THEN PRESIDENT BILL 

1264
00:32:57,041 --> 00:32:57,308
CLINTON. 

1265
00:32:57,308 --> 00:32:59,310
TO SAY THAT HE'S NEVER SIDED 

1266
00:32:59,310 --> 00:33:00,511
WITH WOMEN IS JUST RIDICULOUS. 

1267
00:33:00,511 --> 00:33:01,980
>>REPORTER:  HE HAS IMPLIED 

1268
00:33:01,980 --> 00:33:02,947
THAT THEY'RE COMING OUT OF THE 

1269
00:33:02,947 --> 00:33:06,284
WOODWORK ALL OF A SUDDEN AND 

1270
00:33:06,284 --> 00:33:07,485
CITED THAT AS A REASON WHY -- 

1271
00:33:07,485 --> 00:33:09,387
EVEN THOUGH HE HAS CALLED FOR 

1272
00:33:09,387 --> 00:33:10,054
AN INVESTIGATION -- 

1273
00:33:10,054 --> 00:33:10,788
>> HE'S SAYING THAT BECAUSE 

1274
00:33:10,788 --> 00:33:11,455
AFTER JUDGE KAVANAUGH HAS BEEN 

1275
00:33:11,455 --> 00:33:14,258
IN PUBLIC SERVICE AND IN THE 

1276
00:33:14,258 --> 00:33:15,693
PUBLIC EYE FOR OVER 26 YEARS, 

1277
00:33:15,693 --> 00:33:16,627
BEEN THROUGH SIX BACKGROUND 

1278
00:33:16,627 --> 00:33:17,762
INVESTIGATIONS, NOW PART OF A 

1279
00:33:17,762 --> 00:33:19,831
SEVENTH THAT THIS IS THE FIRST 

1280
00:33:19,831 --> 00:33:22,066
TIME THAT YOU'RE EVER HEARING 

1281
00:33:22,066 --> 00:33:22,766
OF ANY OF THESE ALLEGATIONS, 

1282
00:33:22,766 --> 00:33:25,136
THE FACT THAT THROUGH ALL OF 

1283
00:33:25,136 --> 00:33:25,770
THOSE BACKGROUND CHECKS, NOT 

1284
00:33:25,770 --> 00:33:27,772
EVEN AN INKLING OF ANY OF THOSE 

1285
00:33:27,772 --> 00:33:28,605
THINGS HAS EVER COME UP, 

1286
00:33:28,605 --> 00:33:30,641
DESPITE THE FACT HE WAS ONE OF 

1287
00:33:30,641 --> 00:33:31,976
THE TOP PROSECUTORS FOR KEN 

1288
00:33:31,976 --> 00:33:32,743
STARR AND IN A MAJOR PUBLIC 

1289
00:33:32,743 --> 00:33:34,145
POSITION, NONE OF THESE THINGS 

1290
00:33:34,145 --> 00:33:34,412
CAME UP. 

1291
00:33:34,412 --> 00:33:35,946
WHEN HE WAS NOMINATED TO BE ON 

1292
00:33:35,946 --> 00:33:37,115
THE FEDERAL BENCH, NONE OF 

1293
00:33:37,115 --> 00:33:37,848
THESE THINGS CAME UP. 

1294
00:33:37,848 --> 00:33:39,984
HE HAS BEEN A PUBLIC FIGURE AND 

1295
00:33:39,984 --> 00:33:41,219
THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF 

1296
00:33:41,219 --> 00:33:43,488
OPPORTUNITY FOR PEOPLE TO RAISE 

1297
00:33:43,488 --> 00:33:44,455
THIS ISSUE AND IT NEVER HAS. 

1298
00:33:44,455 --> 00:33:46,858
AND NOW AT THE 11th HOUR THE 

1299
00:33:46,858 --> 00:33:47,825
DEMOCRATS HAVE EXPLOITED THIS 

1300
00:33:47,825 --> 00:33:49,760
PROCESS AND DONE SO PUBLICLY 

1301
00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:51,028
AND IT'S A SHAME, AND HE'S 

1302
00:33:51,028 --> 00:33:51,896
SIMPLY CALLING THAT OUT. 

1303
00:33:51,896 --> 00:33:57,401
THANKS SO MUCH, GUYS. 

1304
00:33:57,401 --> 00:33:57,901
WE'LL SEE YOU SOON. 

1305
00:33:57,901 --> 00:33:59,370
>> THE PRESIDENT IS JUST 

1306
00:33:59,370 --> 00:33:59,871
STATING THE FACTS. 

1307
00:33:59,871 --> 00:34:01,139
THAT COMES FROM SARAH HUCKABEE 

1308
00:34:01,139 --> 00:34:03,875
SANDERS, PRESS SECRETARY THERE 

1309
00:34:03,875 --> 00:34:04,809
WHEN ASKED ABOUT THE 

1310
00:34:04,809 --> 00:34:05,543
PRESIDENT'S COMMENTS OVERNIGHT 

1311
00:34:05,543 --> 00:34:07,745
REGARDING -- EXCUSE ME, THE 

1312
00:34:07,745 --> 00:34:10,214
PRESIDENT'S COMMENTS AT A RALLY 

1313
00:34:10,214 --> 00:34:12,382
CRITICIZING AND COMING OFF AS 

1314
00:34:12,382 --> 00:34:14,118
MOCKING DR. CHRISTINE BLASEY 

1315
00:34:14,118 --> 00:34:15,018
FORD AND HER TESTIMONY. 

1316
00:34:15,018 --> 00:34:17,221
WE ALSO HEARD FROM AMBASSADOR 

1317
00:34:17,221 --> 00:34:19,891
BOLTON WHO SPOKE ABOUT NORTH 

1318
00:34:19,891 --> 00:34:21,958
KOREA AND IRAN AND ALSO THE 

1319
00:34:21,958 --> 00:34:22,592
PALESTINIAN-ISRAELI CONFLICT AS 

1320
00:34:22,592 --> 00:34:22,793
WELL. 

1321
00:34:22,793 --> 00:34:24,462
WE'LL GET TO ERROL BARNETT WITH 

1322
00:34:24,462 --> 00:34:24,661
THAT. 

1323
00:34:24,661 --> 00:34:27,398
BUT A LOT OF THIS FOCUSED ON 

1324
00:34:27,398 --> 00:34:29,867
KAVANAUGH AND EXACTLY WHAT THE 

1325
00:34:29,867 --> 00:34:31,869
PRESIDENT HAD TO SAY WHEN HE 

1326
00:34:31,869 --> 00:34:34,472
DID MOCK DR. CHRISTINE BLASEY 

1327
00:34:34,472 --> 00:34:35,106
FORD IN THAT RALLY YESTERDAY. 

1328
00:34:35,106 --> 00:34:36,007
AND WE HEARD FROM SARAH 

1329
00:34:36,007 --> 00:34:36,806
HUCKABEE SANDERS SAYING THAT 

1330
00:34:36,806 --> 00:34:41,212
SHE WAS -- HE WAS JUST STATING 

1331
00:34:41,212 --> 00:34:41,745
THE FACTS, POINTING OUT 

1332
00:34:41,745 --> 00:34:43,880
DISCREPANCIES IN HER STORY AND 

1333
00:34:43,880 --> 00:34:44,313
STATING THE FACTS. 

1334
00:34:44,313 --> 00:34:44,982
THAT WAS SORT OF THE BOTTOM 

1335
00:34:44,982 --> 00:34:48,820
LINE THAT SHE HAD TO SAY. 

1336
00:34:48,820 --> 00:34:50,321
DOES THIS JEOPARDIZE REPUBLICAN 

1337
00:34:50,321 --> 00:34:50,554
VOTES? 

1338
00:34:50,554 --> 00:34:51,889
SARAH HUCKABEE SANDERS SAID I 

1339
00:34:51,889 --> 00:34:53,891
DON'T THINK SO. 

1340
00:34:53,891 --> 00:34:54,759
WHEN WE HEARD FROM BOLTON, HE 

1341
00:34:54,759 --> 00:34:56,025
ALSO TALKED ABOUT NORTH KOREA, 

1342
00:34:56,025 --> 00:34:59,063
HE WAS ASKED POINT BLANK BY A 

1343
00:34:59,063 --> 00:35:00,198
REPORTER IF HE TRUSTS KIM JONG-

1344
00:35:00,198 --> 00:35:01,465
UN AS MUCH AS THE PRESIDENT 

1345
00:35:01,465 --> 00:35:02,233
DOES, AND HE DODGED THAT 

1346
00:35:02,233 --> 00:35:04,402
QUESTION AND CHOSE NOT TO 

1347
00:35:04,402 --> 00:35:04,768
ANSWER IT. 

1348
00:35:04,768 --> 00:35:07,438
BUT WHY DON'T WE TALK ABOUT 

1349
00:35:07,438 --> 00:35:08,172
KAVANAUGH, JUDGE KAVANAUGH WITH 

1350
00:35:08,172 --> 00:35:09,072
CBS NEWS WHITE HOUSE 

1351
00:35:09,072 --> 00:35:10,941
CORRESPONDENT WEIJIA JIANG WHO 

1352
00:35:10,941 --> 00:35:11,875
WAS AT THE BRIEFING. 

1353
00:35:11,875 --> 00:35:13,811
WEIJIA, WE WERE JUST TALKING 

1354
00:35:13,811 --> 00:35:15,413
ABOUT HOW SHE WAS ASKED -- 

1355
00:35:15,413 --> 00:35:18,448
SARAH HUCKABEE SANDERS WAS 

1356
00:35:18,448 --> 00:35:19,082
ASKED IF THIS WOULD JEOPARDIZE 

1357
00:35:19,082 --> 00:35:19,316
VOTES? 

1358
00:35:19,316 --> 00:35:20,585
I DON'T THINK SO WAS HER 

1359
00:35:20,585 --> 00:35:20,851
RESPONSE. 

1360
00:35:20,851 --> 00:35:22,987
WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF WHAT WE 

1361
00:35:22,987 --> 00:35:23,588
HEARD TODAY? 

1362
00:35:23,588 --> 00:35:24,488
>>REPORTER:  WELL, YOU KNOW, 

1363
00:35:24,488 --> 00:35:25,389
REENA, WHAT ELSE WAS SHE GOING 

1364
00:35:25,389 --> 00:35:29,160
TO SAY IN THIS IS A VERY TOUGH 

1365
00:35:29,160 --> 00:35:30,694
POSITION HAVING TO DEFEND 

1366
00:35:30,694 --> 00:35:32,563
PRESIDENT TRUMP AFTER HE WENT 

1367
00:35:32,563 --> 00:35:33,097
THERE LAST NIGHT. 

1368
00:35:33,097 --> 00:35:35,099
AND EVEN THOUGH SARAH SANDERS 

1369
00:35:35,099 --> 00:35:35,800
AND OTHER ADMINISTRATION 

1370
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:39,003
OFFICIALS INSIST THAT HE WAS 

1371
00:35:39,003 --> 00:35:40,037
NOT MOCKING DR. FORD, THAT 

1372
00:35:40,037 --> 00:35:42,873
CERTAINLY WAS THE TONE THAT 

1373
00:35:42,873 --> 00:35:45,576
MANY PEOPLE ARE PERCEIVING THIS 

1374
00:35:45,576 --> 00:35:47,545
TO BE, INCLUDING THOSE CRITICAL 

1375
00:35:47,545 --> 00:35:48,879
REPUBLICANS WHO WILL 

1376
00:35:48,879 --> 00:35:50,715
ESSENTIALLY DECIDE WHETHER 

1377
00:35:50,715 --> 00:35:51,682
JUDGE KAVANAUGH IS CONFIRMED. 

1378
00:35:51,682 --> 00:35:54,185
AS WE KNOW SENATORS COLLINS AND 

1379
00:35:54,185 --> 00:35:55,886
FLAKE WHO ARE ON THE FENCE CAME 

1380
00:35:55,886 --> 00:35:59,056
OUT THIS MORNING AND, YOU KNOW, 

1381
00:35:59,056 --> 00:36:01,058
CALLED WHAT HE SAID IN HIS TONE 

1382
00:36:01,058 --> 00:36:01,358
APPALLING. 

1383
00:36:01,358 --> 00:36:03,794
AND SO THE BIG QUESTION FOR 

1384
00:36:03,794 --> 00:36:06,230
SARAH SANDERS TODAY WAS IS IT 

1385
00:36:06,230 --> 00:36:06,496
WORTH IT? 

1386
00:36:06,496 --> 00:36:09,700
IS IT WORTH USING THAT SORT OF 

1387
00:36:09,700 --> 00:36:10,867
RHETORIC TO TALK ABOUT DR. 

1388
00:36:10,867 --> 00:36:13,471
FORD, AND SHE MAINTAINED THAT 

1389
00:36:13,471 --> 00:36:16,641
HE WAS SIMPLY POINTING OUT THE 

1390
00:36:16,641 --> 00:36:17,541
FACTS, POINTING OUT 

1391
00:36:17,541 --> 00:36:18,609
INCONSISTENCIES IN HER STORY 

1392
00:36:18,609 --> 00:36:21,045
BASED ON WHAT OTHER PEOPLE HAVE 

1393
00:36:21,045 --> 00:36:25,182
SAID AS WELL SO FAR IN THE 

1394
00:36:25,182 --> 00:36:25,549
INVESTIGATION. 

1395
00:36:25,549 --> 00:36:26,751
BUT POINTING OUT DISCREPANCYIES 

1396
00:36:26,751 --> 00:36:29,453
AND WHAT WE HEARD FROM THE 

1397
00:36:29,453 --> 00:36:30,755
PRESIDENT ARE TWO VERY 

1398
00:36:30,755 --> 00:36:31,355
DIFFERENT THINGS, RIGHT? 

1399
00:36:31,355 --> 00:36:32,723
AND SO SHE DIDN'T GIVE AN 

1400
00:36:32,723 --> 00:36:34,325
ALTERNATIVE TO THE CLAIMS THAT 

1401
00:36:34,325 --> 00:36:37,395
HE WAS MOCKING HER, BUT SHE WAS 

1402
00:36:37,395 --> 00:36:38,295
VERY FIRM THAT HE WASN'T 

1403
00:36:38,295 --> 00:36:41,032
MOCKING HER, THAT HE WAS SIMPLY 

1404
00:36:41,032 --> 00:36:42,966
TRYING TO POINT OUT THE FACTS. 

1405
00:36:42,966 --> 00:36:43,901
BUT TO YOUR ORIGINAL QUESTION, 

1406
00:36:43,901 --> 00:36:45,469
REENA, I THINK, YOU KNOW, THIS 

1407
00:36:45,469 --> 00:36:47,104
IS THE LINE OF DEFENSE RIGHT 

1408
00:36:47,104 --> 00:36:47,304
NOW. 

1409
00:36:47,304 --> 00:36:48,239
YOU KNOW, WE TALK TO SOURCES 

1410
00:36:48,239 --> 00:36:49,840
THIS MORNING AS WELL WHO SAY 

1411
00:36:49,840 --> 00:36:51,742
THE SAME THING THAT THE 

1412
00:36:51,742 --> 00:36:54,412
PRESIDENT DIDN'T DO ANYTHING 

1413
00:36:54,412 --> 00:36:56,514
WRONG BECAUSE HE JUST WANTS TO 

1414
00:36:56,514 --> 00:36:57,715
PRESENT THE MOST ACCURATE 

1415
00:36:57,715 --> 00:36:58,916
VERSION OF THIS STORY, WELL, 

1416
00:36:58,916 --> 00:37:00,918
THEN WHY NOT WAIT? 

1417
00:37:00,918 --> 00:37:03,954
WHY NOT WAIT FOR THE F.B.I. 

1418
00:37:03,954 --> 00:37:05,656
úTO 

1419
00:37:05,656 --> 00:37:08,259
PRESENT WHAT IT FOUND BEFORE 

1420
00:37:08,259 --> 00:37:08,959
DECIDING ON HIS OWN? 

1421
00:37:08,959 --> 00:37:10,027
OF COURSE THE PRESIDENT HAS 

1422
00:37:10,027 --> 00:37:12,897
SEEMED TO DECIDE ON HIS OWN 

1423
00:37:12,897 --> 00:37:16,133
SINCE THE VERY BEGINNING HERE 

1424
00:37:16,133 --> 00:37:17,134
ABOUT WHETHER HE BELIEVES DR. 

1425
00:37:17,134 --> 00:37:18,436
FORD, EVEN THOUGH HE SAYS THE 

1426
00:37:18,436 --> 00:37:18,669
F.B.I. 

1427
00:37:18,669 --> 00:37:20,905
OUGHT TO INVESTIGATE AND THAT 

1428
00:37:20,905 --> 00:37:21,872
HE WANTS TO HEAR HER TESTIMONY, 

1429
00:37:21,872 --> 00:37:25,509
ON THE OTHER HAND MANY TIMES HE 

1430
00:37:25,509 --> 00:37:29,613
HAS SAID THAT, YOU KNOW, IT IS 

1431
00:37:29,613 --> 00:37:32,015
HER BURDEN TO PROVE THAT. 

1432
00:37:32,015 --> 00:37:33,584
AND SO -- 

1433
00:37:33,584 --> 00:37:33,851
>> SORRY. 

1434
00:37:33,851 --> 00:37:35,886
BOTTOM LINE THE SENSE FROM THE 

1435
00:37:35,886 --> 00:37:37,355
WHITE HOUSE, IS IT OPTIMISM 

1436
00:37:37,355 --> 00:37:38,556
THAT THIS NOMINATION WILL 

1437
00:37:38,556 --> 00:37:39,757
ULTIMATELY GO THROUGH WHEN IT 

1438
00:37:39,757 --> 00:37:42,126
GOES DOWN FOR A VOTE? 

1439
00:37:42,126 --> 00:37:43,427
>>REPORTER:  YES, ABSOLUTELY. 

1440
00:37:43,427 --> 00:37:44,228
THEY BELIEVE THAT DESPITE THESE 

1441
00:37:44,228 --> 00:37:48,932
HANDFUL OF REPUBLICAN SENATORS 

1442
00:37:48,932 --> 00:37:49,367
 

1443
00:37:49,367 --> 00:37:51,802
BELIEVE THAT HE WILL IN FACT BE 

1444
00:37:51,802 --> 00:37:52,102
CONFIRMED. 

1445
00:37:52,102 --> 00:37:53,237
AT LEAST THAT'S THEIR MESSAGE, 

1446
00:37:53,237 --> 00:37:57,541
BUT CERTAINLY, YOU KNOW, THERE 

1447
00:37:57,541 --> 00:37:58,709
IS A CONCERN HERE BECAUSE, 

1448
00:37:58,709 --> 00:38:00,911
AGAIN, THE WHOLE REASON WHY THE 

1449
00:38:00,911 --> 00:38:03,848
SENATE HAS NOT VOTED ALREADY IS 

1450
00:38:03,848 --> 00:38:06,050
BECAUSE OF THIS UNCERTAINTY AND 

1451
00:38:06,050 --> 00:38:07,251
THIS UNCERTAINTY WILL NOT BE 

1452
00:38:07,251 --> 00:38:08,386
RESOLVED UNTIL THEY HEAR FROM 

1453
00:38:08,386 --> 00:38:09,320
THE F.B.I. 

1454
00:38:09,320 --> 00:38:10,888
SO I THINK THEY ARE GETTING 

1455
00:38:10,888 --> 00:38:13,924
AHEAD OF THEMSELVES IN ASSUMING 

1456
00:38:13,924 --> 00:38:15,493
THAT EVERYTHING WILL BE JUST 

1457
00:38:15,493 --> 00:38:16,861
FINE BECAUSE OTHERWISE THOSE 

1458
00:38:16,861 --> 00:38:18,596
SENATORS WOULD HAVE AGREED TO 

1459
00:38:18,596 --> 00:38:20,164
VOTE ALREADY, BUT THEY ARE 

1460
00:38:20,164 --> 00:38:23,768
STANDING FIRM AND THEY WANT TO 

1461
00:38:23,768 --> 00:38:24,902
HEAR WHATEVER THE F.B.I. 

1462
00:38:24,902 --> 00:38:26,604
FINDS AND DESPITE THE OPTIMISM 

1463
00:38:26,604 --> 00:38:29,607
HERE THAT IS BEING PRESENTED, I 

1464
00:38:29,607 --> 00:38:30,941
DO THINK THAT THERE'S AN 

1465
00:38:30,941 --> 00:38:31,876
UNDERCURRENT OF CONCERN, 

1466
00:38:31,876 --> 00:38:34,445
ESPECIALLY GIVEN THE FACT THAT, 

1467
00:38:34,445 --> 00:38:35,912
YOU KNOW, THOSE KEY REPUBLICANS 

1468
00:38:35,912 --> 00:38:36,846
REACTED IN THAT WAY TO WHAT 

1469
00:38:36,846 --> 00:38:38,883
PRESIDENT TRUMP SAID LAST NIGHT 

1470
00:38:38,883 --> 00:38:39,250
AT THAT RALLY. 

1471
00:38:39,250 --> 00:38:40,951
>> INTERESTING TO SEE WHETHER 

1472
00:38:40,951 --> 00:38:42,819
OR NOT THEY WILL FALL IN LINE 

1473
00:38:42,819 --> 00:38:44,922
AND VOTE WITH THE PRESIDENT AS 

1474
00:38:44,922 --> 00:38:45,122
WELL. 

1475
00:38:45,122 --> 00:38:47,792
WEIJIA, I WANT TO THANK YOU SO 

1476
00:38:47,792 --> 00:38:48,992
MUCH FOR JOINING US. 

1477
00:38:48,992 --> 00:38:50,194
>>REPORTER:  THANKS, REENA. 

1478
00:38:50,194 --> 00:38:51,795
>>>  WELL, AS WE HEARD EARLIER, 

1479
00:38:51,795 --> 00:38:54,865
NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER JOHN 

1480
00:38:54,865 --> 00:38:55,633
BOLTON REFERRED TO THE UNITED 

1481
00:38:55,633 --> 00:38:56,267

JUSTICE THAT RULED THIS MORNING 

1483
00:38:58,703 --> 00:39:01,505
THAT THE UNITED STATES MUST 

1484
00:39:01,505 --> 00:39:02,005
EASE SANCTIONS ON IRAN. 

1485
00:39:02,005 --> 00:39:02,840
WELL, HERE'S WHAT SECRETARY OF 

1486
00:39:02,840 --> 00:39:05,876
STATE MIKE POMPEO HAD TO SAY 

1487
00:39:05,876 --> 00:39:06,543
ABOUT THE COURT'SDECISION. 

1488
00:39:06,543 --> 00:39:09,013
>> I'M ANNOUNCING THAT THE 

1489
00:39:09,013 --> 00:39:10,848
UNITED STATES IS TERMINATING 

1490
00:39:10,848 --> 00:39:14,518
THE 1955 TREATY OF AMITY WITH 

1491
00:39:14,518 --> 00:39:14,718
IRAN. 

1492
00:39:14,718 --> 00:39:17,021
THIS IS A DECISION, FRANKLY 

1493
00:39:17,021 --> 00:39:18,154
THAT IS 39 YEARS OVERDUE. 

1494
00:39:18,154 --> 00:39:21,192
>> THE DECADES-OLD TREATY DEALT 

1495
00:39:21,192 --> 00:39:23,294
WITH ECONOMIC AND CONSULAR TIES 

1496
00:39:23,294 --> 00:39:24,361
BETWEEN THE U.S. AND IRAN. 

1497
00:39:24,361 --> 00:39:25,796
CBS NEWS CORRESPONDENT ERROL 

1498
00:39:25,796 --> 00:39:26,664
BARNETT WAS AT SECRETARY 

1499
00:39:26,664 --> 00:39:29,133
POMPEO'S BRIEFING AND HE JOINS 

1500
00:39:29,133 --> 00:39:29,767
US NOW FROM WASHINGTON. 

1501
00:39:29,767 --> 00:39:31,134
SO, ERROL, WHAT WAS THE REASON 

1502
00:39:31,134 --> 00:39:32,403
THAT POMPEO GAVE FROM PULLING 

1503
00:39:32,403 --> 00:39:34,171
OUT OF THIS TREATY AND WHAT DO 

1504
00:39:34,171 --> 00:39:36,540
YOU THINK IT MEANS WHEN IT 

1505
00:39:36,540 --> 00:39:38,309
ULTIMATELY COMES DOWN TO 

1506
00:39:38,309 --> 00:39:38,809
U.S./IRANIAN RELATIONS? 

1507
00:39:38,809 --> 00:39:39,643
>>REPORTER:  WELL, THE BOTTOM 

1508
00:39:39,643 --> 00:39:40,845
LINE HERE IS THAT DIPLOMATIC 

1509
00:39:40,845 --> 00:39:41,712
RELATIONS BETWEEN THE UNITED 

1510
00:39:41,712 --> 00:39:43,681
STATES AND IRAN ARE BAD AND 

1511
00:39:43,681 --> 00:39:44,181
THEY'RE GETTING WORSE. 

1512
00:39:44,181 --> 00:39:45,216
SECRETARY OF STATE POMPEO 

1513
00:39:45,216 --> 00:39:48,886
PULLING OUT OF THIS TREATY 

1514
00:39:48,886 --> 00:39:50,521
WHICH EFFECTIVELY ESTABLISHES 

1515
00:39:50,521 --> 00:39:51,155
DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS AND, YOU 

1516
00:39:51,155 --> 00:39:53,190
KNOW, BENEFICIAL ECONOMIC TRADE 

1517
00:39:53,190 --> 00:39:54,592
BETWEEN THE TWO NATIONS AT A 

1518
00:39:54,592 --> 00:39:56,994
TIME WHEN SANCTIONS ARE ABOUT 

1519
00:39:56,994 --> 00:39:58,162
TO HIT ON IRAN ON NOVEMBER 4th 

1520
00:39:58,162 --> 00:39:59,897
BECAUSE OF PRESIDENT TRUMP'S 

1521
00:39:59,897 --> 00:40:03,267
DECISION TO PULL OUT OF THE 

1522
00:40:03,267 --> 00:40:03,700
IRAN NUCLEAR DEAL. 

1523
00:40:03,700 --> 00:40:04,468
THE NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER 

1524
00:40:04,468 --> 00:40:07,037
JOHN BOLTON AT THE WHITE HOUSE 

1525
00:40:07,037 --> 00:40:09,273
THIS AFTERNOON REITERATING THE 

1526
00:40:09,273 --> 00:40:10,541
SECRETARY'S POINTS AND 

1527
00:40:10,541 --> 00:40:11,809
EFFECTIVELY SAYING THAT, LOOK, 

1528
00:40:11,809 --> 00:40:13,644
ALL OF THESE MULTI-NATIONAL 

1529
00:40:13,644 --> 00:40:18,315
BODIES, NOT JUST AT THE U.N. 

1530
00:40:18,315 --> 00:40:18,849
BUT ELSEWERE ARE BIASED, 

1531
00:40:18,849 --> 00:40:21,685
INEFFECTIVE AND HAVE NO REAL 

1532
00:40:21,685 --> 00:40:23,888
JURISDICTION WHEN IT COMES TO 

1533
00:40:23,888 --> 00:40:25,021
THE UNITED STATES DOMESTIC AND 

1534
00:40:25,021 --> 00:40:25,388
FOREIGN POLICY. 

1535
00:40:25,388 --> 00:40:26,323
THE NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER 

1536
00:40:26,323 --> 00:40:27,491
JOHN BOLTON ALSO SAYING THAT 

1537
00:40:27,491 --> 00:40:30,861
THE U.S. IS PULLING OUT OF THE 

1538
00:40:30,861 --> 00:40:32,863
VIENNA CONVENTION ON DIPLOMATIC 

1539
00:40:32,863 --> 00:40:33,797
RELATIONS BECAUSE PALESTINIANS 

1540
00:40:33,797 --> 00:40:36,000
BROUGHT A COMPLAINT TO THAT 

1541
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:39,136
ENTITY BECAUSE THE U.S. MOVED 

1542
00:40:39,136 --> 00:40:42,406
ITS JERUSALEM AND ISRAEL FROM 

1543
00:40:42,406 --> 00:40:43,273
TEL AVIV TO JERUSALEM. 

1544
00:40:43,273 --> 00:40:45,409
SO THIS IS A FEW HITBACKS FROM 

1545
00:40:45,409 --> 00:40:47,611
THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION IN THE 

1546
00:40:47,611 --> 00:40:50,347
WAKE OF PRESIDENT TRUMP'S U.N. 

1547
00:40:50,347 --> 00:40:51,849
GENERAL ASSEMBLY SPEECH WHICH 

1548
00:40:51,849 --> 00:40:53,384
WAS ABOUT SOVEREIGNTY AND THE 

1549
00:40:53,384 --> 00:40:54,819
LIMITS OF MULTI-NATIONAL BODIES 

1550
00:40:54,819 --> 00:40:56,921
AND THE U.S. IS SHOWING THAT IT 

1551
00:40:56,921 --> 00:40:59,623
DOES NOT FIND A LOT OF THESE 

1552
00:40:59,623 --> 00:41:00,891
ENTITIES TO BE EFFECTIVE, TO BE 

1553
00:41:00,891 --> 00:41:03,227
LEGITIMATE, AND IT IS NOW 

1554
00:41:03,227 --> 00:41:03,894
PULLING OUT OF THEM. 

1555
00:41:03,894 --> 00:41:05,696
SECRETARY OF STATE POMPEO 

1556
00:41:05,696 --> 00:41:06,630
SAYING THE RELATIONSHIP WITH 

1557
00:41:06,630 --> 00:41:08,732
IRAN IS NOT POSITIVE AND 

1558
00:41:08,732 --> 00:41:09,599
NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER 

1559
00:41:09,599 --> 00:41:11,902
BOLTON SAYING THE SAME THING, 

1560
00:41:11,902 --> 00:41:14,171
BUT THEIR BEEF IS WITH THE 

1561
00:41:14,171 --> 00:41:15,205
AYATOLLAHS, WITH THE 

1562
00:41:15,205 --> 00:41:15,940
GOVERNMENT, WITH THE 

1563
00:41:15,940 --> 00:41:16,240
LEADERSHIP. 

1564
00:41:16,240 --> 00:41:16,907
THEY BOTH MADE POINTS TODAY TO 

1565
00:41:16,907 --> 00:41:19,243
SAY IT IS NOT WITH THE IRANIAN 

1566
00:41:19,243 --> 00:41:19,710
PEOPLE. 

1567
00:41:19,710 --> 00:41:20,811
>> YOU KNOW, POMPEO WE KNOW, 

1568
00:41:20,811 --> 00:41:21,979
ERROL, IS ALSO TRAVELING TO 

1569
00:41:21,979 --> 00:41:22,579
NORTH KOREA LATER THIS WEEK. 

1570
00:41:22,579 --> 00:41:25,482
WHAT DID HE HAVE TO SAY ABOUT 

1571
00:41:25,482 --> 00:41:26,016
THAT UPCOMING VISIT? 

1572
00:41:26,016 --> 00:41:27,384
>> THAT'S RIGHT.  

1573
00:41:27,384 --> 00:41:27,951
BE HEADING TO JAPAN, NORTH 

1574
00:41:27,951 --> 00:41:29,954
KOREA, SOUTH KOREA AND CHINA AS 

1575
00:41:29,954 --> 00:41:33,224
HE TRIES TO PULL TOGETHER U.S. 

1576
00:41:33,224 --> 00:41:35,359
ALLIES IN THE REGION TO MAKE 

1577
00:41:35,359 --> 00:41:39,129
PROGRESS TOWARD THIS TRACK FOR 

1578
00:41:39,129 --> 00:41:41,332
A FULL VERIFIABLE AND 

1579
00:41:41,332 --> 00:41:41,932
IRREVERSIBLE DENUCLEARIZATION 

1580
00:41:41,932 --> 00:41:43,300
OF THE NORTH KOREAN PENINSULA. 

1581
00:41:43,300 --> 00:41:44,234
BUT HERE'S WHAT WE KNOW. 

1582
00:41:44,234 --> 00:41:45,235
THE DEADLINE FOR THIS LOFTY 

1583
00:41:45,235 --> 00:41:48,872
GOAL IS THE END OF PRESIDENT 

1584
00:41:48,872 --> 00:41:50,273
TRUMP'S FIRST TERM IN JANUARY 

1585
00:41:50,273 --> 00:41:50,473
2021. 

1586
00:41:50,473 --> 00:41:52,743
AND WE KNOW THAT NORTH KOREA IN 

1587
00:41:52,743 --> 00:41:54,712
THE SHORT TERM WANTS THE U.S. 

1588
00:41:54,712 --> 00:41:56,580
TO OFFICIALLY DECLARE AN END TO 

1589
00:41:56,580 --> 00:41:59,783
THE KOREAN WAR BY THE END OF 

1590
00:41:59,783 --> 00:42:00,551
THIS YEAR. 

1591
00:42:00,551 --> 00:42:01,919
THERE'S NO SIGNS YET FROM THE 

1592
00:42:01,919 --> 00:42:02,720
TRUMP ADMINISTRATION THAT WILL 

1593
00:42:02,720 --> 00:42:03,320
HAPPEN. 

1594
00:42:03,320 --> 00:42:07,291
WE KNOW THAT THE U.S. WANTS A 

1595
00:42:07,291 --> 00:42:08,024
FULL I10ARY FROM NORTH KOREA. 

1596
00:42:08,024 --> 00:42:09,626
-- ITINERARY FROM NORTH KOREA. 

1597
00:42:09,626 --> 00:42:10,861
WHAT KIND OF NUCLEAR ASSETS DO 

1598
00:42:10,861 --> 00:42:13,364
YOU HAVE, WHERE ARE THEY IN THE 

1599
00:42:13,364 --> 00:42:15,165
COUNTRY, SO THEN THEY CAN 

1600
00:42:15,165 --> 00:42:16,066
EFFECTIVELY MEASURE HOW CLOSE 

1601
00:42:16,066 --> 00:42:16,800
KOREA IS GETTING TO 

1602
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:18,035
DENUCLEARIZE OR OPEN UP THESE 

1603
00:42:18,035 --> 00:42:19,770
SITES FOR INTERNATIONAL 

1604
00:42:19,770 --> 00:42:21,271
INSPECTORS AND THAT HAS YET TO 

1605
00:42:21,271 --> 00:42:21,505
HAPPEN. 

1606
00:42:21,505 --> 00:42:23,274
SO SECRETARY OF STATE POMPEO AT 

1607
00:42:23,274 --> 00:42:24,875
THIS STAGE IS PAINTING DIALOGUE 

1608
00:42:24,875 --> 00:42:27,077
AS SUCCESS, THE FACT THAT THE 

1609
00:42:27,077 --> 00:42:28,479
U.S. AND NORTH KOREA'S TOP 

1610
00:42:28,479 --> 00:42:29,212
DIPLOMAT, POMPEO AND HIS 

1611
00:42:29,212 --> 00:42:30,714
COUNTERPART SPOKE TO EACH OTHER 

1612
00:42:30,714 --> 00:42:32,049
AT THE U.N. GENERAL ASSEMBLY, 

1613
00:42:32,049 --> 00:42:33,417
HE SAYS THAT'S PROGRESS. 

1614
00:42:33,417 --> 00:42:35,185
THE FACT THAT YOU DON'T HAVE 

1615
00:42:35,185 --> 00:42:36,020
PRESIDENT TRUMP CALLING KIM 

1616
00:42:36,020 --> 00:42:37,855
JONG-UN ROCKET MAN ANY MORE, HE 

1617
00:42:37,855 --> 00:42:39,256
SAYS THAT IS PROGRESS, AND HE 

1618
00:42:39,256 --> 00:42:42,359
HOPES IT WILL RESULT IN 

1619
00:42:42,359 --> 00:42:42,960
SOMETHING TANGIBLE SOON. 

1620
00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:44,695
WE'LL HAVE TO WAIT AND SEE, YOU 

1621
00:42:44,695 --> 00:42:46,096
KNOW, WHAT THAT IS UNTIL AFTER 

1622
00:42:46,096 --> 00:42:48,699
HE DOES HIS ASIAN TOUR THIS 

1623
00:42:48,699 --> 00:42:48,966
WEEKEND. 

1624
00:42:48,966 --> 00:42:49,667
>> IT'S INTERESTING, THOUGH, 

1625
00:42:49,667 --> 00:42:51,468
THE WHITE HOUSE PRESS BRIEFING 

1626
00:42:51,468 --> 00:42:54,238
AMBASSADOR BOLTON STOPPED SHY 

1627
00:42:54,238 --> 00:42:55,606
OF ACTUALLY DIRECTLY SAYING 

1628
00:42:55,606 --> 00:42:56,640
THAT HE TRUSTS KIM JONG-UN. 

1629
00:42:56,640 --> 00:42:58,208
WHAT'S THE MOOD, ERROL, IN THE 

1630
00:42:58,208 --> 00:42:59,442
WHITE HOUSE, DO THEY TRUFTZ? 

1631
00:42:59,442 --> 00:43:01,011
DO YOU THINK POMPEO TRUSTS KIM 

1632
00:43:01,011 --> 00:43:02,646
JONG-UN THE WAY THE PRESIDENT 

1633
00:43:02,646 --> 00:43:02,879
DOES? 

1634
00:43:02,879 --> 00:43:03,981
>>REPORTER:  WELL, LOOK, IF YOU 

1635
00:43:03,981 --> 00:43:04,748
LISTEN TO PRESIDENT TRUMP'S 

1636
00:43:04,748 --> 00:43:06,650
MOST RECENT COMMENTS AT ONE OF 

1637
00:43:06,650 --> 00:43:07,951
HIS RALLIES, HE AND KIM JONG-UN 

1638
00:43:07,951 --> 00:43:09,954
FELL IN LOVE AND KIM JONG-UN 

1639
00:43:09,954 --> 00:43:11,755
SENT TWO BEAUTIFUL LETTERS TO 

1640
00:43:11,755 --> 00:43:14,558
HIM THAT HE SAYS ARE WORKS OF 

1641
00:43:14,558 --> 00:43:14,758
ART. 

1642
00:43:14,758 --> 00:43:16,026
THAT'S ON THE PRESIDENTIAL 

1643
00:43:16,026 --> 00:43:16,260
FRONT. 

1644
00:43:16,260 --> 00:43:18,429
BUT WHEN YOU LOOK AT NATIONAL 

1645
00:43:18,429 --> 00:43:19,029
SECURITY ADVISER JOHN BOLTON 

1646
00:43:19,029 --> 00:43:21,398
AND HIS HISTORY, HE HAS BEEN A 

1647
00:43:21,398 --> 00:43:24,902
HAWK HERE IN WASHINGTON WHEN IT 

1648
00:43:24,902 --> 00:43:27,171
COMES TO CONFRONTING EITHER 

1649
00:43:27,171 --> 00:43:28,372
NUCLEAR POWERS OR POTENTIAL 

1650
00:43:28,372 --> 00:43:29,139
NUCLEAR POWERS AROUND THE 

1651
00:43:29,139 --> 00:43:29,372
WORLD. 

1652
00:43:29,372 --> 00:43:30,607
AND SO HIS VIEWS ON IRAN ARE 

1653
00:43:30,607 --> 00:43:32,409
QUITE FIRM, AND I THINK THAT'S 

1654
00:43:32,409 --> 00:43:34,945
WHAT YOU HEARD HIM DODGE 

1655
00:43:34,945 --> 00:43:35,879
ANSWERING THAT QUESTION OF 

1656
00:43:35,879 --> 00:43:37,247
TRUSTING KIM JONG-UN BECAUSE 

1657
00:43:37,247 --> 00:43:39,783
THAT FAMILY HAS NOT PROVED 

1658
00:43:39,783 --> 00:43:42,986
ITSELF TO BE TRUSTWORTHY WITH 

1659
00:43:42,986 --> 00:43:44,388
ANY U.S. ADMINISTRATION IN 

1660
00:43:44,388 --> 00:43:44,721
DECADES PAST. 

1661
00:43:44,721 --> 00:43:45,889
BUT HE'S CERTAINLY SOMEONE TO 

1662
00:43:45,889 --> 00:43:47,625
WATCH BECAUSE SINCE BOLTON CAME 

1663
00:43:47,625 --> 00:43:49,793
ON BOARD, THE ADMINISTRATION, 

1664
00:43:49,793 --> 00:43:51,895
YOU'VE SEEN A MUCH MORE 

1665
00:43:51,895 --> 00:43:53,430
AGGRESSIVE POSTURE WHEN IT 

1666
00:43:53,430 --> 00:43:54,297
COMES TO THE INTERNATIONAL 

1667
00:43:54,297 --> 00:43:54,631
STAGE. 

1668
00:43:54,631 --> 00:43:55,765
IT'S SOMETHING TO KIND OF WATCH 

1669
00:43:55,765 --> 00:43:58,168
CLOSELY HERE IN THE WEEKS AND 

1670
00:43:58,168 --> 00:44:01,171
MONTHS AHEAD AS THE U.S. DEALS 

1671
00:44:01,171 --> 00:44:02,338
WITH TWO, YOU KNOW, ALMOST 

1672
00:44:02,338 --> 00:44:03,474
NUCLEAR POWERS WITH IRAN AND 

1673
00:44:03,474 --> 00:44:04,841
NORTH KOREA AND WHAT TO DO 

1674
00:44:04,841 --> 00:44:05,142
ABOUT THEM. 

1675
00:44:05,142 --> 00:44:07,177
>> WE'LL HAVE TO WAIT AND SEE 

1676
00:44:07,177 --> 00:44:07,911
EXACTLY HOW THIS GOES DOWN. 

1677
00:44:07,911 --> 00:44:09,579
ERROL BARNETT, GRATEFUL YOU 

1678
00:44:09,579 --> 00:44:10,547
