IT'S UN-AMERICAN TO DO WHAT HAS
BEEN DONE.
>> ALL OF THOSE UGLY BIGOTED
RULINGS USUALLY FIND THE DUSTPAN
AND I THINK THIS WILL TOO.
>> Martha: HERE NOW PATRICK
MORRISSEY, WHO SUPPORTS THE BAN
AND IS ALSO RUNNING AGAINST
DEMOCRAT JOE MANCHIN IN THE
SENATE RACE THERE AND MY GERMAN,
MUSLIM AMERICANS IMPACTED BY THE
TRAVEL BAN.
JUST TO GO BACK TO THE PRESIDENT
SIMPLE QUESTION.
WE HAVE TO KNOW WHO'S COMING OR
ANY ARGUMENT FROM THESE FIVE
COUNTRIES AT THIS MOMENT THEIR
VETTING SYSTEM ISN'T EFFECTIVE
ENOUGH TO ENSURE THAT THEY ARE
NOT ALLOWING PEOPLE TO WISH US
HARM TO COME.
>> AS YOU MENTIONED, THIS IS THE
THAT HIS PURPOSE FOR INSTITUTING
THIS POLICY WAS TO BAN MUSLIMS
FROM COMING INTO THE
UNITED STATES.
>> Martha: THERE'S A HUGE
MUSLIM POPULATION, MANY
COUNTRIES THAT ARE NOT INCLUDED
IN THIS BAN.
>> ABSOLUTELY.
>> Martha: IF HE REALLY WANTED
TO DO THAT HE WOULD HAVE TO BAN
ALL OF THEM.
WAY OF DOING IT BUT IT'S
INEFFECTIVE TO ACCOMPLISH WHAT
HE WANTS AND ALSO INEFFECTIVE
SECURITY AND DOZENS OF NATIONAL
SECURITY PROFESSIONALS SIGNED ON
ACKNOWLEDGING NOT JUST THAT THIS
WOULD NOT IMPROVE SECURITY BUT
IT WOULD ACTUALLY HARM SECURITY.
>> Martha: THE PRESIDENTS WILL
TAKE CARE, AND THE SUPREME COURT
RULED THAT WHATEVER THE
PRESIDENT SET ALONG THE WAY IS
NOT AN ISSUE TO THEM.
THEY LOOK AT THE LETTER OF THE
WAY THIS IS LAID OUT AND THEY
SEE IT AS FIVE COUNTRIES THAT
ARE ON A TEMPORARY BAN UNTIL
THEY CAN PROVE THAT THEIR
VETTING SYSTEM WORKS.
>> I THINK IT'S VERY CLEAR THAT
THE PRESIDENT ACTED WITHIN HIS
AUTHORITY ALL ALONG BECAUSE HE
HAS THE ABILITY UNDER BOTH THE
CONSTITUTION AND STATUTES TO
ENGAGE IN A PROCESS TO VET
ALIENS THAT COME INTO THE
COUNTRY AND AS YOU PROPERLY
POINTED OUT ON THIS RECENT
TRAVEL BAN, ONLY FIVE AND THERE
ARE PROBABLY ANOTHER 45 OR 50
MUSLIM COUNTRIES THAT WERE
ACTUALLY NOT PART OF THAT
PROCESS BECAUSE THEIR PROCEDURES
WERE DETERMINED TO BE STRONG.
THE PRESIDENT I THINK HAS ACTED
CONSISTENTLY ALL ALONG.
THE DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND
SECURITY HAS GONE THROUGH AN
EXTENSIVE VETTING PROCESS AND
THEY WERE NOT ABLE TO POKE HOLES
IN IT.
THIS IS THE RIGHT DECISION.
PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS STOOD UP FOR
THIS COUNTRY SAFE, DO YOU FEEL
CONFIDENT THAT YEMEN, FOR
EXAMPLE, HAS AN AIRTIGHT SYSTEM
OF VETTING PEOPLE TO MAKE SURE
THAT PEOPLE WHO WANT TO COME
HERE FROM YEMEN OR SUDAN THAT
>> I WOULD NEVER ARGUE THAT
THERE IS ANY COUNTRY THAT HAS A
PERFECT SYSTEM OR ANYWHERE NEAR
A PERFECT SYSTEM BUT IF WE LOOK
AT WHO HAS ACTUALLY BEEN A
ENGLAND.
RICHARD REID, THE SHOE BOMBER.
PEOPLE WHO HAVE COME FROM OTHER
COUNTRIES THAT HAVE NOTHING TO
DO WITH THIS BAN.
IF WE ARE TALKING ABOUT
SECURITY, LET'S FOCUS ON THOSE
VERY FEW PEOPLE WERE ACTUALLY
POSING A PROBLEM AND NOT IMPOSE
A HARDSHIP ON THE MANY
THOUSANDS, HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS
OF PEOPLE WHO ARE TOTALLY
INNOCENT THAT AREN'T TRYING TO
HARM AMERICA AND ARE ACTUALLY
TRYING TO HELP AMERICA.
>> Martha: YOUR MAIN ARGUMENT
IS THAT IT'S NOT EFFECTIVE.
THAT IT DOESN'T MAKE US SAFER?
>> THE MAIN ARGUMENT IS THAT
IT'S UNCONSTITUTIONAL IN THAT IT
HAS A NEGATIVE IMPACT ON OUR
RELIGIOUS LIBERTY AND THE RIGHTS
OF AMERICANS TO HAVE THEIR
FAMILY MEMBERS -- GO
>> I THINK YOU GO BACK TO WHAT
WE TALKED ABOUT A LITTLE BIT
EARLIER.
A SMALL SUBSET OF MUSLIM
COUNTRIES AND ONE THING YOU ARE
SEEING IS THAT IF COUNTRIES GET
BETTER VETTING SYSTEMS AND
INFORMATION SHARING THEY GET
REMOVED FROM THE LIST.
>> Martha: IRAQ IS THE
EXAMPLE.
IT WAS IN THE ORIGINAL ORDER,
IT'S NOT IN THIS ORDER.
>> THAT'S JUST THOUGHTFULNESS ON
THE PART OF THE EXECUTIVE TO
MAKE SURE THAT IT'S IMPLEMENTING
A LAW FOCUSED ON NATIONAL
SECURITY INTERESTS.
I THINK THAT SHOULD BE WHAT
PEOPLE TALK ABOUT TODAY, THIS
ADMINISTRATION HAS BENT OVER
BACKWARDS TO DO THIS THE RIGHT
WAY.
THIS IS THE THIRD ITERATION.
THERE'S NO SURPRISE THAT THE
SUPREME COURT UPHELD WHAT THEY
DID TODAY.
I THINK IT WOULD HAVE BEEN
DRAMATIC IF THEY HAD ACTUALLY
GONE THE OTHER WAY BECAUSE IF
YOU THINK ABOUT THE PLAINTIFF'S
ARGUMENTS, THEY WOULD LITERALLY
EPIDEMIC OR A POTENTIAL NATIONAL
SECURITY RISK WHICH YOU KNOW IS
EMANATING FROM A COUNTRY.
THEIR APPROACH WOULD LIMIT THE
PRESIDENT'S AUTHORITY TO PROTECT
OUR NATION AND THAT'S NOT
PROPER.
>> Martha: THE JUSTICES HAVE
VOTED IN FAVOR OF THIS WENT BY
THE WORDS THAT WERE IN THIS
DOCUMENT AND APPLIED THEM AS
THEY SAW.
I'VE GOT TO LEAVE IT THERE.
PLEASE COME BACK.
