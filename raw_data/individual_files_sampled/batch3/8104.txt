APPEARS EVERYONE IS NOW READY FOR IT TO END. MARTHA. Martha: HERE NOW TAMMY BRUCE PRESIDENT OF THE INDEPENDENT WOMEN'S VOICE AND FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR AND FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTER FATHER JONATHAN MORRIS AND ENRIQUE. WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE PICTURES AND HISTORY OF THIS LAW, IT HAS BEEN IN PLACE FOR A VERY LONG TIME. PHIL I THINK WE CAN AGREE FAMILY SEPARATION IS CRUEL, INHUMANE AND IN THIS CASE COMPLETELY UNJUSTIFIABLE. THERE IS NO LAW IN OUR IMMIGRATION BOOKS THAT SAYS THAT CHILDREN CAN BE SEPARATED OR SHOULD BE SEPARATED FROM THEIR PARENTS. THAT'S JUST NOT THE CASE. RIGHT NOW, WHAT WE HAVE A POLICY IMPLEMENTED BY THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION ZERO TOLERANCE THAT IS HAS RESULTED IN OVER 1900 KIDS BEING SEPARATED FROM THEIR PARENTS. Martha: LET ME ASK YOU THIS. WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF JEFF SESSIONS EXPLANATION WHEN HE SAYS, YOU KNOW, WHEN A PARENT COMMITS A CRIME, THE CHILD CANNOT GO TO JAIL WITH THEM IN ORDER TO KEEP THE FAMILY TOGETHER. AND THEY ARE SAYING, CROSSING THE BORDER ILLEGALLY IS BREAKING THE LAW. SO WHEN THAT HAPPENS, UNFORTUNATELY, TEMPORARILY WHILE THE PARENTS GO THROUGH THE PROCESS BECAUSE THEY ARE NOT GOING TO BE CAUGHT AND RELEASED. THEY HAVE TO FIND SAFE PLACES TO HOLD THESE CHILDREN. HAVE YOU IMAGES OF SOME OF THOSE AREAS. OBVIOUSLY IT'S A TERRIBLE SITUATION FOR FAMILIES TO BE SEPARATED. BUT, YOU KNOW, WHEN YOU LOOK AT IT THAT WAY, DOES THAT MAKE A SENSE TO YOU. THERE IS DISCRETION. NOT PUTTING SHOPLIFTERS IN EVERY CASE AND NOT SEPARATING THEM. WE ARE NOT PUTTING POSSESSION BEHIND BARS IN EVERY CASE AND SEPARATING THEM FROM THEIR CHILDREN. AND THEY ARE ALSO BREAKING THE LAW. THERE IS SUCH A THING AS DISCRETION. BEFORE ZERO TOLERANCE IMPLEMENTED THAT WAS THE CASE WOMEN GRANT FAMILIES. WE DON'T NEED TO SEPARATE IMMIGRANT FAMILIES AND ALMOST 2,000 KIDS FROM THEIR PARENTS JUST TO MAKE A POINT AND USES THAT A DETERRENT. CHIEF OF STAFF ATTORNEY GENERAL JEFF SESSIONS HAS SAID. Martha: OTHER THING THEY SAID SINCE THEY BECAME LAX IN THIS PROGRAM IT WAS SORT OF UNDERSTOOD BY SOME PEOPLE WHO WANTED TO GET INTO THE COUNTRY THAT IF YOU COME AS A FAMILY THEY WILL LET YOU THROUGH. BETTER WAY TO COME AND BRING YOUR KIDS AND NOW OBVIOUSLY THAT'S CHANGED. THAT'S ONE OF THE PROBLEMS WITH THE POLICY FOR YEARS IS THAT WE EFFECTIVELY SUBSIDIZE THIS KIND OF APPROACH THAT PEOPLE FOUND OUT THAT IF YOU HAVE A CHILD YOU WILL BE CAUGHT AND RELEASED. VERSUS NOT HAVING A CHILD. THE "NEW YORK TIMES" REPORTED IN APRIL THAT IN FACT, PEOPLE ARE ADMITTING THIS FAMILIES BROUGHT CHILDREN KNOWING THERE WAS A BETTER CHANCE THEY WOULD GET THROUGH AND BE RELEASED AND OTHERS, THIS IS THE SERIOUS DYNAMIC WITH UNACCOMPANIED MINORS, AND MINORS IN CHILDREN ARE PEOPLE POSING AS PARENTS. SO HERE WE HAVE THE OUTRAGES OVERCOMING THE FACTS. I WILL GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE. THREE REASONS WHY ADULTS OR PARENTS ARE SEPARATED FROM CHILDREN. ONE, THEY ARE POSING AS THE PARENT AND THEY'RE NOT THE PARENT. THEY ARE A THREAT TO THE CHILD. OR THEY ARE PUT INTO CRIMINAL PROCEEDINGS. THIS IS IT'S NOT A WHOLE SCALE. ZERO TOLERANCE. AND SO THIS IS ALSO, AGAIN, SOMETHING THAT WAS HAPPENING THROUGHOUT THE OBAMA REGIME AS WELL. BUT IT COMES DOWN TO CATCH AND RELEASE. BUT WE HAVE FACILITATED THE PARENTS BRING ACROSS THE BORDER IN A WAY GAME THE SYSTEM. THIS IS WHAT THE PRESIDENT WANTS TO STOPPED. HE STATED HE WANTS IT STOPPED. ALL OF US ARE OUTRAGED THAT WE ARE EVEN IN THIS DYNAMIC AND IT COMES DOWN TO AN OR DID HELY IMMIGRATION DYNAMIC AND SECURITY AT THE BORDER WHERE WE CAN TREAT EVERYONE WITH DIGNITY AND PEOPLE ARE NOT ENCOURAGED TO MOVE INTO THE COUNTRY IN THIS FASHION. Martha: LET ME BRING IN FATHER JONATHAN. HAVE YOU CATHOLIC BISHOPS AND FRANKLY GRAHAM ARGUING THESE FAMILIES NEED TO BE HELD TOGETHER. CATHOLIC BISHOP ARGUE GOING ANYONE IS HELPING TO IMPLEMENT THIS PROGRAM AND IS CATHOLIC THEY COULD POTENTIALLY BE EXCOMIEWRN INDICATED FOR BEING PART OF IT. OKAY. THAT. WAS ONE BISHOP WHO ACTUALLY SUGGESTED THAT I DON'T THINK IT REPRESENTS ALL OF THEM. THE FACT IS THAT WE HAVE 20% MORE CHILDREN IN THIS SITUATION SEPARATED FROM THEIR CHILDREN THIS YEAR COMPARED TOO LAST YEAR. IT'S A BIG DEAL. WE HAVE TO SOLVE. THIS WE'RE NOT THAT FAR AWAY FROM SOLVING IT. BOTH PRESIDENT TRUMP AS WELL AS THE REPUBLICAN AND THE DEMOCRATS ALSO THIS IS AN OUTRAGEOUS SITUATION. WHOSE FAULT IS IT? OF COURSE THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO ARE FAKING BRINGING CHILDREN OVER AND SAYING THAT THEY ARE THEIR CHILDREN THAT'S NOT. OF COURSE THERE ARE PEOPLE BREAKING THE LAW COMING OVER ILLEGALLY. ALL OF THAT IS BAD. THE GOVERNMENT HAS TO BE BIGGER THAN THAT TO SAY WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO ABOUT IT? THERE ARE CHILDREN THERE ALONE. IT'S TRAUMATIC FOR THEM. TRAUMATIZING FOR THEM. SAY THIS NOT FROM A THEORETICAL PERSPECTIVE. I LIVE IN THE SOUTH BRONX. I SEE WHAT'S HAPPENING TO THESE FAMILIES WITH THESE CHILDREN. I SEE CHILDREN WHO ARE HERE WITHOUT PARENTS. OKAY. THE PARENTS ARE DEFINITELY NOT PERFECT AND THEY SHOULDN'T BE CROSSING ILLEGALLY BUT THE GOVERNMENT HAS TO FIGURE OUT WHAT WE ARE GOING TO DO FOR THE SAKE OF THESE CHILDREN. Martha: WHAT DO THEY DO? DO THEY CHANGE THE LAW? DO THEY INCARCERATE FAMILIES TOGETHER? ENRIQUE, WHAT'S THE SOLUTION? YOU HAVE THE FOLKS WHO ARE BREAKING THE LAW. AND THERE SALAH THERE IS A BORDER. YOU ARE NOT ALLOWED TO CROSS THE BORDER ILLEGALLY AND THEN YOU HAVE, I THINK EVERYONE HERE IN THIS CONVERSATION AND OUTSIDE OF IT WHO REALLY UNDERSTANDS THAT THIS IS NOT AN IDEAL SITUATION. THE PRESIDENT MADE THAT CLEAR HIMSELF. I APPRECIATE THE QUESTION, MARTHA. WE SHOULD BE FOCUSING ON SOLUTIONS. I THINK THE SOLUTION IS NOT SEPARATING FAMILIES. THERE ARE VERY FEW EXAMPLES OF GOVERNMENT USING FAMILY SEPARATION THROUGHOUT HISTORY. WE DON'T WANTS TO BE PART OF THAT THE SOLUTION IS JUST NOT BUILDING WALLS AND REDUCING THE LEGAL PATH FOR IMMIGRANTS TO COME INTO THIS COUNTRY AND, AGAIN, SEPARATING CHILDREN FROM THEIR PARENTS. I THINK THE SOLUTION HAS TO DO WITH FINDING THE ROOT CAUSES OF IMMIGRATION. HAVING A WIDER LEGAL PATH PEOPLE COME HERE AND DO THE JOBS WE NEED THEM TO DO. A LOT OF SOLUTIONS THAT WEEKEND, YOU KNOW, AGREE ON IN CONGRESS. BUT EXTREMES TAKING OVER THE DEBATE AND NO SPACE FOR COMPREHENSIVE IMMIGRATION. Martha: YOU HAVE A COUPLE OF THOSE GOING TO BE CONSIDERED EVENTUALLY IT LOOKS LIKE WOULD ALLOW $25 BILLION TO BUILD THE WALL AS WELL AS A SOLUTION TO THIS PROBLEM TO KEEP FAMILIES TOGETHER. SO IS THAT A WORKABLE SOLUTION? TAMMY AND FATHER JONATHAN. WE DEFINITELY WANT, ESPECIALLY IF THIS DYNAMIC WHERE YOU CAN KEEP A FAMILY TOGETHER WITHIN A SEPARATE KIND OF FACILITY SO, YOU DON'T HAVE TO SEPARATE THEM. AND THEN THAT PROCESS IS VERY QUICK, AS A MATTER OF FACT, THEN THEY BECOME HOME AS A UNIT. COULD THEY GO BACK HOME TO THEIR HOME COUNTRY AND OTHERS WANT THEM RELEASED HERE THAT CAN BE VERY QUICK FRAMEWORK. KEEPING FAMILIES TOGETHER ONCE A CRIMINAL PROCEEDING IS OVER USUALLY WITHIN THE SAME DAY AND THEN SENT HOME. THE OTHER FRAMEWORK, THIS IS HOW WE HANDLE KEEPING FAMILIES TOGETHER WHILE ALSO RESPECTING OUR LAWS HERE AT HOME. MARTHA, WE CAN'T FORGET THAT THERE IS TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF HYPOCRISY OVER MANY DIFFERENT ADMINISTRATIONS. THE FACT THAT WE HAVE WE ARE RIGHT NOW ALLOWING PEOPLE TO COME IN, GIVING THEM WORK, NO DOUBT, GIVING THEM WORK AND THEN SAYING HEY, LISTEN, BUT YOU CAN'T BE FULL MEMBERS OF OUR SOCIETY. BECAUSE WE DO NOT WANT TO DO EVERIFY SYSTEM. IN OUR SYSTEM WE DO NOT WANT TO ACTUALLY FIND OUT WHO IS ILLEGAL. WE CAN'T FORGET THAT WE ARE TAKING ADVANTAGE AND THERE ARE CHILDREN WHO ARE GROWING UP RIGHT NOW WHO HAVE BEEN HERE IN THE COUNTRY FOR THEIR WHOLE LIVES OR WITH FAMILIES WHO SIMPLY, THE PARENTS ARE WORKING BUT THEY CANNOT BECOME FULL MEMBERS OF OUR SOCIETY AND IT'S NOT HELPFUL. Martha: POLITICS DON'T GET IN THE WAY OF A SOLUTION. BOTH SIDES WOULD REALLY RATHER NOT HAVE THE OTHER SIDE INVOLVED TO COME UP WITH A SOLUTION IT SEEMS WITH THIS VERY HOT DEBATE.
