Fe Peter Miller gum / Co FFA we have got to get to the anti-catholic bigotry that has just bubbled up in the last two weeks before that though before we get to Catholicism I have to talk about an Orthodox Jew Ben Shapiro said something really shocking on his show today it was broadly about Yale Law School just play the clip and we can talk about it so Yale Law School is let's face it a second-rate law school I mean I went to Harvard so I should know and the Yale Law Students are proving themselves to be inferior law students just as Yale proved itself an inferior College by accepting my friend Michael Knowles into its school the reality is yale law students seem not to know exactly how judicial appointments work i know it's absolutely shocking to say that sort of thing publicly on air he called me his friend can you believe this my jaw dropped when I saw that clip incredible it is you know the story that Ben is referencing is that these Yale Law students these very recent yale law students the last few years are very upset that a Yale Law graduate Brett Kavanaugh is now going to be on the Supreme Court and they're very upset that Yale Law issued a press release and said hey we're proud that one of our graduates has been nominated to the Supreme Court that's pretty good and they said how dare you it's people are gonna die Rober and it is really sad because a number of the people on that list were contemporaries and classmates of mine in undergraduate so I do know a bunch of them and they're pretty they were eccentric they were not at parties you know that kind of like my I don't know nothing's fun everything's terrible I mean really far left radical left people so you know okay guys you signed your name to the petition I bet that'll stop Cavanaugh I bet that'll stop him from going to the court very funny and and Ben called me a friend okay so let's move on to the main story which is the anti-catholic bigotry and it really is bubbling up like crazy here this is not a new experience in the United States CNN ran this piece today the question is why do Catholics hold a strong majority on the Supreme Court simple enough question there are a lot of Catholics on the Supreme Court Byron Wolfe wrote this piece in the crystal is a section of CNN the point he says quote there's only ever been one Catholic president and Catholics or a declining portion of the u.s. population but they're holding a strong majority in the US Supreme Court when President Donald Trump nominated Brett Kavanaugh of the Supreme Court Tuesday night Cavanaugh described his Catholic faith and the importance of the church in his life from the high school he attended to the Catholic Youth Organization basketball teams he now coaches ooh Catholic Youth Organization basketball ooh right you're getting very nervous as you read this if confirmed Cavanaugh will replace Anthony Kennedy who is Catholic ish Trump's other nominee now justice Neal Gorsuch replaced Catholic Antonin Scalia Gorsuch attends Episcopal churches now but was raised Catholic CNN's Daniel Burke has written that that about Gorsuch his faith which he keeps private and it is a complicated matter so all right oh he's got faith he might believe in God oh this is complicated this is scary aren't you afraid every other Republican appointed justice he writes on the court is Catholic and Democrat appointed Sonia Sotomayor was raised Catholic during her nomination she described herself as a cultural Catholic so let's just take that part for a second it's all this insinuation and this is what the left has been adding to the conversation for weeks now I'm not being anti-catholic but isn't it strange isn't it strange all of these Catholics show up on the court he go he actually goes on in this piece a justice this religion does not nor should it matter but it is certainly a curiosity of modern politics that Catholic and Jewish justices have found such success yeah it's a very curiosity on the courts that said have so many Catholic and Jewish justices yeah yeah I was doing that was did my Martin Luther impression by the way I don't know what you thought that was but there is a perception he goes on that male Catholics on the court are more likely to vote against abortion and perhaps plays a role among conservatives looking to chip away at roe v wade just that language there is a perception that says it all this is the mainstream media trick it was a critics say that George W Bush is a terrible mean monster critics say some people say and that's the reason there is a perception there's a perception among whom what perception what do you mean there's a perception no you think that you are insinuating that there is an insinuation by CNN that Catholics are going to throw away the Constitution and judge cases based on what the Pope tells them to do that's what CNN is saying that's what there is there is a perception that's there is a perception and of course justices religion should not matter and how they read the Constitution but very often the the fastest-growing religion in the country atheism does affect how people view it there the final piece of this he says Anna Pew survey from 2014 the fastest growing religious group is unaffiliated which grew from sixteen point one percent in 2007 to twenty two point eight percent eclipsing Catholicism in the u.s. in the process so he's saying he's saying on the one hand these kind of ask personal aspects of our character they shouldn't affect how we interpret the text we should interpret the text as it's written on the other hand the Supreme Court should reflect the population broadly but the Supreme Court's not a popular institution the Supreme Court isn't the legislature it's not supposed to represent the people you're supposed to interpret the law it's the the logos the logic of the country not the pathos not the spirit of the emotion of the country and so he wants to have asked a community to and it's all just insinuation this is nothing new anti-catholic bigotry in the United States has always been this way or if they're Schlessinger the the 20th century historian he said that anti-catholicism he's a quote the deepest bias in his three of the American people we don't think of it that way popularly we think the biases racism or sexism or anti American Indian or whatever anti-catholicism from the very beginning has been a defining feature of the United States but it's kind of taken different forms and now it is bubbling up on the Left a Thomas Nast the great political cartoonist he drew a cartoon in the nineteenth century of Catholics little bishops as crocodile's on the American Ganges it was Catholic crocodiles climbing up the river Ganges to subvert the United States but we actually got public schools in America because of anti-catholicism that's where a lot of our public education comes from because there was a senator from Maine I believe James Blaine who was so worried about the proliferation of Catholic schools in the United States you know for all of Western history just about the Catholic schools have played a role in educating the the elite and have educated so many people in the last two millenium so he was worried about the proliferation of them in the US and he said that we need public schooling that is non-sectarian u.s. grant same thing was afraid of Catholic schooling so he came out and he said he feared a future where patriotism and intelligence was on one side and superstition ambition and greed was on the other all of that referring to Catholics he said he wanted schools unmixed with quote atheistic pagan or sectarian teaching the u.s. grant this a you know good general good president and sectarian was the euphemism used for Catholic so you see this even on the Republican side bubbling up for a while before we get to where it's going now on the Left it's got to make a little money

institution in America public schooling because there was a fear of Catholics this used to be a big issue among the Republicans you actually had this this Reverend Samuel Bouchard who is a Republican he had this quote he said we are Republicans and don't propose to leave our party and identify ourselves with the party whose antecedents have been rum Romanism and rebellion and I only like two of those three by the way I only like two of those three rum rum anism and rebellion now this it wasn't only Republicans there what the KKK was anti-catholic that was the terrorist wing of the Democrat Party and now the Democrats are the anti-catholic ones but they've been the subject of a lot of a lot of bigotry in the u.s. in 1891 the largest mass lynching in American history was against Sicilians was against Catholic Sicilians in 1921 father James Coyle was assassinated in Birmingham by a Methodist minister talking about fire and brimstone minister goes that there actually kills a Catholic priest and where this really came to a head the last time we had a real bubbling of aunty Catholicism in America was JFK and JFK being just a crass degenerate Democrat politician it took exactly the wrong approach on this the question when JFK was running for president 1960 was if you have a Catholic in the White House is he just gonna take his orders from the Pope what if the Pope tells him to do something is he gonna do that does the Pope then control the United States and we laugh at that now but this was the anti-catholic fear then the way JFK approached this really has poisoned religion in American politics in many ways since here's JFK I believe in an America where the separation of church and state is absolute I believe in a president whose views on religion are its own private a fail neither imposed upon him by the nation nor imposed by the nation upon him as they condition to holding that office so what he says is look I'm I'm a Catholic running for president the way that I'm going to catholic catholicism is going to inform my presidency is not at all whatsoever i'm don't even really think about it that much seriously I'm not that Catholic that's his response but that's crazy of course our views our religious views inform our views of other things in the world politics is downstream of culture culture comes from the cult it comes from what we worship so this shouldn't affect how we view the Constitution we shouldn't want to rewrite the Constitution into the catechism of the Catholic Church but of course it affects our views on the world we view the world in a certain way through this lens we think that human life has dignity and purpose because of our religious views some religions don't believe that some people think human life doesn't have any dignity that we can kill it and it doesn't matter at all that life doesn't have a purpose is just about giving ourselves pleasure all the time that we don't really have any sort of free will we're just a bunch of bumbling sacks of cells and neurons walking around like zombies pretending that were individual people your religion informs how you think about everything there's this ridiculous canard they say well you can't legislate morality all legislation legislates morality what what do you think Obamacare does what do you think forcing certain people off their health care plans and taking money from them to pay for other people's health care plans if they don't what do you think that does that's let of course that's legislating a moral point what do you think low taxes or what do you think raising taxes is that's a moral point they say we need to take from the 1% and give it to the 99% that's a moral statement what do you think foreign policy is you're making moral claims about which people were going to protect which people were not going to protect what interests we're going to fight for though these are all moral questions to all politics is the affairs of men and men or moral agents so you know when we interact with each other those are moral transactions of course legislation has a moral component it's just a lie from people who take a very shallow view of religion and that shallow view of religion is where this anti Catholicism is coming from because by the way it's not just anti-catholicism we're seeing that with the Supreme Court nominees it's really anti Christianity it's really anti Western religion and so you've seen it in the media a lot recently for priests showed up to a Donald Trump rally great moves great work Padres really like it sometimes there are a couple streams in public Catholic life there's the one that like believes in Catholicism and then there's the one that's like a little more hippy dippy and it gets a little little more heterodox in their views so good job Padres I really liked like he's sticking up there but when Amy Barrett was being considered for this seat on the Supreme Court there were major news stories that said she was in a cult is that the Catholic Church is a cult now right or she was you know she was in this little religious group that killed each other accountable and you know read the Bible and stuff he said that's a cult because they have a shallow view of religion daily beast writer Michael Jay Michaelson said that Donald Trump is quote carrying out the agenda of a small secretive network of extremely conservative Catholic activists the secret agenda the Opus Dei is coming and he's referring to leonard leo the head of the federalist society and the guy he doesn't first of all what's so incredible is that The Daily Beast writer doesn't know he doesn't know anything about Catholicism he said this guy Leonard Lee he's so crazy he goes to Mass every day and he actually he didn't even say he just goes to Mass he says he says Mass which isn't true priests say Mass so he just doesn't even even the very basic thing of what the masses this guy has no idea whatsoever is in that crazy goes to myth she's probably prays to hey I heard he even reads his Bible right now I mean that he goes on to be sure none of this is to repeat the odious claims of anti-catholicism of papist conspiracies and dual loyalty of course though you know when you say it's like when you follow a sentence with but when you say but it negates the sentence that's reason is I don't want to do negate I don't want to repeat any of that anti-catholic papist conspiracy stuff but he goes to mass boom be afraid you know CNN's Dean Obeidallah said that there are these this cabal of people trying to push Christian Sharia law and obviously when it comes to the Supreme Court this is anti-catholicism they're talking about and of course there is the irony right because they're saying that Christianity is so terrible because it's like Islam and meanwhile they're telling us how great Islam is where all of this comes from is an interview that Antonin Scalia gave to the New York Magazine a number of years ago this actually highlights all of it very well and what it highlights is that people are biblically illiterate in this country and because you have a whole a whole generation out which has been raised without religion they it's just utterly other to them they can't engage in religious questions they don't understand how religion works because they've been raised by postmodern superstition rather than a traditional religion in this interview I'll just read you a fair little chunk of this interview this girl at the New York Magazine she she asks him about his views on religion do you believe in Hell oh yeah I believe in Hell and he is so Scalia's very charming and funny and he's so surprised that she is asking these questions he leans in with a stage whisperin says you know even believe in the devil and the New York magazine lady goes isn't it terribly frightening to believe in the devil and he this is the line the take away you're looking at me as though I'm weird my god are you so out of touch with most of America most of which believes in the devil I mean Jesus Christ believed in the devil it's in the Gospels you travel in circles that are so so removed from mainstream America that you were appalled that anybody would believe in the devil most of mankind has believed in the devil for all of history many more intelligent people than you or me have believed in the devil and that line when I read that that really stuck with me many more intelligent people than you or me have believed in the devil at the time I wasn't even I probably wouldn't have called myself Christian I wouldn't have really thought of myself in a religious sense but that really stuck with me because obviously that's true and and this really gets to the heart of what this new anti Catholicism is it's it's a defense of modernity the reason that this anti Catholicism is bubbling up is because antiochus Catholicism opposes modernity you know theoretically all of our churches should be opposing modernity but we've seen these stories in recent weeks where churches are getting getting a little weak-kneed aren't they the Episcopalian Church which has been crumbling for a long time now they're they have women priests they you know fly gay pride flags outside of the church now the Episcopalian Church in the u.s. that wants to give God a different gender so they're gonna God's gender-neutral now they're trying to neuter God good luck buddy if you read the Old Testament it doesn't go very well when that happens but so that's fallen away a lot of sort of mainstream evangelical protestant churches in America have become left-wing have become a little social justice II have become a little soft have become very modern and in sport this makes sense because paratus the Protestant revolution is what began the modern era and that followed a certain logical course the Catholic Church ate modern it is now even though there we have some acoustic guitar churches here it is pretty rock-solid and you know it's defending 2000 year old dogma that is why the left absolutely despises at the left is a jealous God leftism is a jealous God when when Dianne Feinstein looked at Amy Coney Barrow and she's being nominated for the federal court and she said I'm very afraid of this because the dogma lives loudly within you all of the religious conservatives thought that's up crazy that's a religious test you can't do that well you know blah blah blah what Dianne Feinstein's fear was wasn't that the Catholic dogma lives loudly within Amy Barrett it's that leftist modern Dogma therefore does not live within Amy Barrett because if you if you were a flick news you're rejecting in no small part modern views that the views that came up in a counter been in response to the Catholic Church in opposition to the Catholic Church and they don't like that so you're allowed to be a JFK Catholic you're allowed to say oh um I go to church I like the smells in the bells you know I like the kind of silly hats and the clothing and everything but I would never reject modern orthodoxies I would never reject I don't know the redefinition of marriage or abortion or I would never reject those things are one of those are those are the modern sacraments but the minute that you come out you say no I actually believe in the dogma then they hit you and it's gonna come back I mean right now we're seeing a huge backlash to modernism we're seeing it fall apart in many ways because of its illogical ends because of the craziness of choosing your own gender just a few years ago I'm old enough to remember there were only two genders now there are 56 and they're multiplying a few years ago it was lesbian gay and bisexual now it's LGBTQ PA and LMNOP WXYZ and it goes on and on and on and it gets crazy there is a reaction that's going on to this and and you're gonna see a lot of the same themes of anti-catholicism that are coming back you know a Hilaire Belloc they create a French English Catholic writer he said that to reject the faith the Catholic faith is to write yourself down forever as suburban peace that's very elitist sort of snobbish statement but there is something to it the analogy could be in political conservatism as well there is this kind of rock-ribbed bedrock that hasn't been brought off onto the the rails and modernity too much and that's what the left is reacting to and that's what some people on the right are reacting true as well unfortunately people like Tommy Lara and I've been very mean to Tommy Lauren recently and I'm gonna have to be a little bit mean in my last few minutes of this segment today without further ado I feel so bad hitting on Tommy well I wouldn't feel bad hitting on Tommy you know when I was single but I feel bad attacking Tommy because she's on the right I think to hit rightward is basically grave mortal sin but sometimes you got to do it here is Tommy Lauren doubling down on her pro-abortion fanaticism on Fox News I think that it's important to clarify it my statements there because first and foremost I believe that Judge Cavanaugh is a constitutional conservative not a religious judicial activist which is exactly what we want my problem is with some of my fellow conservatives who have put it out there that we are quote coming for roe v wade that is a mistake because we are putting it out there and implying that we are sending a justice a justice to the bench to carry out religious judicial activism which is a mistake and is unconstitutional and if we as conservatives are going to imply that if that's going to be our messaging we might as well spit on the Constitution that is not what we stand for if we are not going to uphold the Constitution on its merit who will that is up to us to do so that my real problem here regardless of my views on abortion pro-life pro-choice is the messaging of our Supreme Court justice and how he will handle roe v wade if it comes to that point she just doesn't know anything she just doesn't know if she is saying words which we recognize so we are mistaking that for an opinion but that isn't as just words mashed together conveying nothing to take her main point I'm gonna you know I actually invited Tommy on the show to see if she wanted it so that I could correct some things but she she responded with something of a firm no so I don't know maybe if people don't Witter want to try to get her to come on the show that might be nice because really what she's saying now can't go without a response it's so wrong and stupid that it needs to be responded to because she's got these millions and millions of viewers on Fox News where she's regularly spouting this nonsense so it does demand a response I fear well she's spouting things like this I fear that she's going to end up just becoming one of these ex Republican lefties like or on every other news channel you know the Steve Schmidt types and Anna Navarro's and David Fromm and whatever you know they go on and they bash the Republican Party I fear that because what she's saying doesn't make any sense the religious judicial activism what is the judicial activism the question is on Roe vs. Wade and cases that immediately preceded it in cases that followed from it Oh duh is roe v wade decided constitutionally is there a constitutional right to an abortion is there more broadly a constitutional right a general right to privacy what do you think Tommy Lauren is there no the answer is no and most lefties will even admit that to you so if the Constitution does not enshrine a right to abortion if the framers in Philadelphia didn't think that they were saying okay and thank goodness we fought that bloody Revolutionary War against the Brits so we can finally kill our babies hooray hip hooray General Washington if that wasn't what the framers were thinking which I don't think they were then that case was unconstitutionally decided if we want to overturn an obviously anti-constitutional case that's not judicial activism that's returning the judiciary to interpreting the law as it says to interpreting the words of the law by what they mean that's the opposite of judicial activism I suppose you could call it activist in the sense that you're you're actively undoing something that was act activists achill II done there reminds me of the chesterton quote there's a thought that stops thought that's the thought that ought to be stopped oh she uses the phrase religious though she attaches that here you she thinks there's no non-religious reason to overturn roe v wade you regardless of anyone's religious views we should overturn roe v wade it's not constitutional it's anti-constitutional it rips apart it spits on the constitution and then she's hung up on this religious thing says when people because some people do have just motivations for overturning roe v wade a million babies die a year in the united states and that number is down i mean that's a that's a relatively lower number million babies die a year in the united states because of that decision so there are religious motivations people who don't like worship Moloch or something or Baal you know want want to see that stop but overturning roe v wade first of all wouldn't be a lies abortion everywhere they'd be a lot of states that still preserve abortion laws it's a it's a constitutional question and just because there are religious motivations that doesn't negate the merits of the argument plenty of good overturning of cases have been motivated for religious reasons how about Dred Scott the Dred Scott decision was motivated for religious reasons wasn't it Dred Scott which said the black people can't be citizens in the United States they're not entitled to rights even free blacks that that decision in 1857 was that I was motivated by almost exclusively Christian abolitionists to have returned that is that does that negate it they say oh you have religious motivation so no okay black people should still be barred from citizenship in any protections in the United States how about buck V Bell buck V Bell is a lesser known among the general population Supreme Court case from 1927 that allowed for the forcible sterilization of the mentally unfit and of criminals is that and there was one dissent there was a lone dissent on that it was the Catholic judge in that case there was the lone dissent it was motivated the dissent in that the overturn that ruling was motivated in in part by some religious views does that mean that we should still forcibly sterilized the mentally unfit I don't think so how about Plessy of you Ferguson separate but equal how about all all of the abolition movements in history and the movements for liberty have been in in large part motivated by Christian feeling does that mean we should get rid of them I don't think so I don't think so at all it's it's so it's a bias I think of coastal Republican types the ones who want to be cool the socially liberal but fiscally conservative you know that's like that's the only way that you can get along go along to get along now but it's crazy because politics is downstream of culture and to go on television and try to spout this stuff is so I don't blame her for being ignorant a lot of people are ignorant what I blame her for is not having the curiosity to even look into this to crack the spine of a book the humility to maybe not shout this ignorant on national television that's the trouble here I wasn't always pro-life I wasn't I didn't always realize how awful abortionist in fact I remember vividly had a conversation while I was in college I was doing a summer fellowship with some bioethicists and I had a conversation with a female bioethicists at lunch I said well I think abortion I don't think it's that big a deal people are so worried about it I don't know and she she said well why is that Michael I I repeated all of the Freakonomics argument so you know which are largely bogus anyway it lowers crime and it's this and it's they're not morally significant blah blah blah and she said okay so which which of those arguments doesn't also apply to kill ethnic minorities in the inner cities young young male ethnic minorities because they commit a crime you know it's a law they were disproportionately on welfare shouldn't we just kill them and I thought oh yeah okay and I'd like cracked the spine of a book I thought about this for more than five seconds and I realized the moral gravity of it she hasn't done that and so if it's fine she doesn't have to I'm not gonna make Tommy Lauren read but if she's other than my but I recommend she does read my book is that that is a good starter you know on the path of political philosophy but but if she's not going to do that she she really should stop spouting this ignorance nobody's trying to shut her up we're trying to educate her and and stop the spread of such nonsense really frustrating but I only I only attack because I love because I want I want the people who go on Fox News to be better and stop spouting such nonsense i attack CNN because I don't love this great clip you got to say do we have time before we go we have maybe a little bit of time before we go you've got to see this clip a pal of mine who has to remain anonymous because this career will get ruined he was watching this live on CNN and they were translating CNN was talking to the relatives of you know illegal aliens who came over and the kids were detained or whatever and they were asking what how are the kids doing what's going on with the kids and here is what CNN played he says he wants me to be with him she says and prays to God to make the day shorter so we can be together and I don't know how many of you speak Spanish out there my Spanish isn't great I mostly have Italian a little touch of French but I think what I heard is the woman said de se que esta muy bien which roughly translates to yeah he says he's doing very well but what did see me play that clip again what did CNN say she said come again it's like in this you know in those movies like with the bad dubbings it'll be a Japanese movie you know and they'll say like you see the mouth moving like and then they'll dump it over and I'll just say like yes you know he said wait does it sound like you said more than that did he you know this is the opposite ear that disa kissed um we bien he says that he's doing terribly and Trump's a criminal and hashtag resists and Brett Kavanaugh was a Catholic and so he shouldn't be on the court what all right are you sure about that unbelievable stuff and somehow no nobody caught this I think it's cuz nobody watches CNN so yeah it's like one conservative every everyday like one conservative in the country has to sell flagellate and watch CNN to pull all the stupid clips so I guess today that's me now maybe other people play it too it's really egregious but that is how dishonest these people are I mean that is how that when you turn on CNN which only exists because of airports because they made a deal with the devil and with airports sometime in the 1990s so CNN is played there all the time if they're not reporting news they are a fiction company making a narrative there is somebody who was writing the script to this and there was like the background it's a DC case time we BN it's like okay well what there's no way to translate that cockamamie language how are we how are we ever gonna find that it's like okay well I think it sounds a little bit like Donald Trump is a monster and I hate him and you should and Hillary should have been elected hashtag me too so just wanted to call that dear attention any time you're tempted to think that we should watch or listen to CNN don't do it I've got a second bite of Facebook in YouTube we've got a great this day in history coming up today and it really ties back into our theme of federalism for only $9.99 per month you can get a subscription to the daily wire you got to go over from Facebook and YouTube you'll get me you get the under Clavin sure you get the Ben Shapiro show you ask questions in the mailbag that's coming up get your mailbag questions in for tomorrow because it is coming up I'm gonna start answering those questions right after this show today and you'll be able to ask questions in conversation none of that matters mmm mmm decoe que esta muy bien de coca ston muy bien these leftist tears mm-hmm-hmm no no I'm certain that grammar was completely wrong but the leftist Jews are really good these days that really Pope ish papist papist variety you just smelly they catch a whiff of that potpourri and they just start pouring out all their tears go to daily we're calm we'll be right back with this day in history we're back to federalism we're back because on this day in history in 1804 the Federalist Alexandre Hamilton was killed in a duel by Aaron Burr what do we take from this this is such an American story by the way Alexander Hamilton is so good even though you know I I know when people think of Alexander Hamilton now they think of like a millennial hip-hop star because that's just that's the cultural representation now but he was unbelievable he was so so good he was born on a Caribbean island of Nevis in either 18 1755 or 1757 we don't know because he was this orphan kid from this Caribbean island he makes it to the mainland of America in 1773 he joins the Continental Army almost immediately and he rises up quickly I mean this is a kid you know an orphan from a Caribbean island and he and he rises up he becomes aid to camp to President Washington Jenner then General Washington so he's with them at Valley Forge he's he's all over then after the Revolutionary War he becomes a delegate to the Constitutional Convention and crafts our Constitution he writes the Federalist Papers he crafts our idea of what the country should be and at all times all these like whenever kind of crazy Radical factions come up he swoops in and just makes it all better he then is appointed first secretary of the Treasury by President Washington and he crafts a monetary system for us that basically prevented us prevented the government from collapsing early on prevented the economy and the government from collapsing really brilliant in his spare time he founded the Federalist Party he founded the Coast Guard and he founded the New York Post talked about a wide variety of one of the best tabloids in America founded by the great Federalists Alexander Hamilton he also this poor kid from the Caribbean was educated at King's College which is what now would be at Columbia University in Aaron Burr it's really hard to deny the existence of God and Providence in history because you get these bizarre coincidence these bizarre parallel stories Aaron Burr born around the same time 1756 so either a year after a year before Alexander Hamilton he he has like the opposite light story he's born into wealth he's born into privilege he's you know he just grows up as a rich kid in New Jersey he attends what is now Princeton then called the College of New Jersey and he too joins the Continental Army kid comes from nothing goes to Columbia kid comes from everything goes to Princeton they joined the Continental Army after that though he didn't distinguish himself in the way that Alexander Hamilton did so he goes back to New York not New Jersey but New York and because is elected to the New York State Assembly and this is how I know that Aaron Burr is a is a monster and a sociopath because with few exceptions people that go to the New York State Assembly are just totally corrupt there are a few exceptions I've actually have a pal who's in the New York State Assembly he's one of the most honorable people I've ever met in politics Kevin Bern everyone else up there it's just a devil you know I think by the time of the indictments finally end in the New York State Assembly the New York State Senate Kevin is gonna be the only one left up there see the only one with any dignity it's really of right now you've got one of the heads of the New York State Assembly is like throwing his son under the bus and an indictment and an investigation just the most corrupt place in the country so that's where Aaron Burr goes he's then elected state attorney and and then their lives intersect when Aaron Burr beats Hamilton's father-in-law for a US Senate seat so now you've got Aaron Burr in the US Senate you've got Alexander Hamilton leading the Federalists crafting our Constitution and in Secretary of Treasury Hamilton early on he had a good gut and he realized that Burr was a monster he hated him with a fiery passion he viewed Burr is a dangerous opportunist and he said quote I feel it is a religious duty to oppose his career which really brings us back to religion too but he just saw this early on Alexander Hamilton was a busy guy he was doing a lot of things starting our monetary system founding parties writing the Constitution winning the Revolutionary War he was a very busy guy he took time out of his very busy schedule to try to destroy Aaron burrs career why did he do that so Adams wins the presidency and after George Washington and at this point Aaron Burr who had run for vice president he was a running mate of Thomas Jefferson with the anti-federalists he left the Senate and returned to the New York Assembly leaves the federal the US Senate goes back to the New York State Assembly isn't that good then Burr to destroy Hamilton leaks documents of Hamilton criticizing fellow Federalist John Adams this may have played a role in John Adams losing re-election in the Federalists losing and Thomas Jefferson coming to power just a you know talk about the deep state this is Aaron Burr the first deep state leak this damaging document on Alexander Hamilton helps him win helps Jefferson win the 1800 race so in those days it's not the the president and vice president were elected were not elected as they are today the guy who got the most electoral votes would be President the second most to be vice president Jefferson and burr each received 73 electoral votes so they should have decided this pretty technically easily it goes to the House of Representatives but the Federalists you know in a move to try to screw everything up and get back at Jefferson through their support behind Aaron Burr so you ended up in the situation where the that running made the VP nominee could have become the president over Thomas Jefferson at this point in Hamilton has no great love for the anti-federalists led by Jefferson Alexander Hamilton gets a bunch of Federalists to throw their support behind Jefferson and break the deadlock and prevent Aaron Burr from being president why because he viewed Aaron Burr is a dangerous demagogue so at this point Aaron Burr has a falling-out with Jefferson they don't get along that well and so he goes back to New York again and seeks the Federalist nomination for the governor of New York he wasn't anti federalists now he's a federalist and an how many of the last governors of New York haven't just gone to prison I don't know is there like a you've got all these awful governors you had Spitzer you know the sex pervert criminal Spitzer you had Cuomo definitely has a ton of skeletons in his closet you've got Patterson wasn't great so all of these guys he goes there he once he wants that job to it really fits his character he loses the race for governor he loses the nomination race he loses the independent race for governor at this point he's extremely angry and he and Hamilton duel they do will be as Hamilton has destroyed his entire life's career now they at these do very often you'd fire into the air you'd resolve it peacefully Hamilton was a fiery guy he'd been in multiple duels in his life nobody ever died it was very Court of decided among gentlemen Aaron Burr was having none of it he aims right in the center of Alexander Hamilton's body blows him away shoots him through the stomach hits his spinal cord kills Alexander Hamilton there was a public outcry at this point because duels were common but killing a man like Alexander Hamilton is a big deal so what is Aaron Burr do the little coward he goes back and stays and as vice president he's immune from prosecution he then flees because he doesn't want to be prosecuted goes go west young man and plots with James Wilkinson who is the commander in chief of the army to try to take over a part of the continent take over part of the country and start their own empire because Aaron Burr apparently proved Alexander Hamilton right at this point then they try to get help from the British that's despicable they then tried to take over part of Spanish America when it didn't work out to take over other parts of America and then Burr leads an army charging into New Orleans into the Louisiana territory and he's put down and he flees to Europe now why do I bring all of this up well one it's an interesting story from a merit early American history but the real takeaway that you have to remember is always listen to the Federalists listen to the Federalist Society listen to the Federalists of the founding of the country they have got it right read the Federalist we were talking about how it's important for people who are conservative to read books they should read the Federalist the Federalists are always right and people who oppose the Federalists are murderous traitors I guess that's is that the take away let's let's make that to take away get your mailbag questions in we will take on all of them tomorrow in the meantime I'm Michael moles this is the Michael Nolt show I'll see you then the michael noland is produced by seniya Villarreal executive producer Jeremy boring senior producer Jonathan
