1
00:00:01,383 --> 00:00:02,216
POINT, IN MORE WAYS THAN WE CAN

2
00:00:02,217 --> 00:00:03,117
EVEN BEGIN.

3
00:00:03,118 --> 00:00:06,120
WITHOUT FURTHER ADO, WE ARE IN

4
00:00:06,121 --> 00:00:09,257
THE STUDIO OF RUSH LIMBAUGH.

5
00:00:09,258 --> 00:00:10,358
FIRST, I WANT TO CONGRATULATE

6
00:00:10,359 --> 00:00:11,893
YOU.

7
00:00:11,894 --> 00:00:13,194
30 YEARS, TALK RADIO, THE KING

8
00:00:13,195 --> 00:00:16,497
OF TALK RADIO, AND GOING

9
00:00:16,498 --> 00:00:17,065
STRONGER THAN EVER.

10
00:00:17,066 --> 00:00:18,466
>> Rush: IT IS AMAZING, IT

11
00:00:18,467 --> 00:00:19,267
REALLY IS.

12
00:00:19,268 --> 00:00:20,134
I AM ENJOYING IT AS MUCH AS I

13
00:00:20,135 --> 00:00:22,403
EVER HAVE, IF NOT MORE SO.

14
00:00:22,404 --> 00:00:24,205
I GET MORE THRILLS FROM IT, I

15
00:00:24,206 --> 00:00:24,939
GET MORE SATISFACTION FROM IT,

16
00:00:24,940 --> 00:00:26,474
THAT I EVER HAD.

17
00:00:26,475 --> 00:00:28,076
IF YOU WOULD'VE TOLD ME 30 YEARS

18
00:00:28,077 --> 00:00:30,078
AGO, OR EVEN 40, WHEN I WAS

19
00:00:30,079 --> 00:00:31,179
DREAMING ABOUT THIS, BY THE TIME

20
00:00:31,180 --> 00:00:34,115
I REACHED 65, THAT IT WOULD BE

21
00:00:34,116 --> 00:00:34,882
MORE COMPETITIVE THAN EVER, THAT

22
00:00:34,883 --> 00:00:36,651
IT WOULD BE MORE INVOLVED -- I

23
00:00:36,652 --> 00:00:40,254
THOUGHT 65, YOU HAVE TO TAKE IT

24
00:00:40,255 --> 00:00:41,656
EASY, GO TO THE BEACH, DO A

25
00:00:41,657 --> 00:00:43,057
COUPLE HOURS A WEEK, THAT IS

26
00:00:43,058 --> 00:00:44,292
THAT, LIKE JOHNNY CARSON DID.

27
00:00:44,293 --> 00:00:46,661
I CAN'T IMAGINE NOT DOING THIS.

28
00:00:46,662 --> 00:00:49,530
LARGELY BECAUSE OF YOU -- AS YOU

29
00:00:49,531 --> 00:00:50,999
JUST LAID OUT, WE ARE SCARCELY

30
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,067
AT A TIPPING POINT.

31
00:00:53,068 --> 00:00:54,669
I DON'T KNOW HOW MANY PEOPLE

32
00:00:54,670 --> 00:00:56,804
ACTUALLY ARE AWARE OF HOW CLOSE

33
00:00:56,805 --> 00:01:01,275
WE ARE TO LOSING OUR COUNTRY IS

34
00:01:01,276 --> 00:01:02,643
FOUNDED.

35
00:01:02,644 --> 00:01:03,511
WHAT IS IT GOING TO BE?

36
00:01:03,512 --> 00:01:07,715
IT REALLY IS AT STAKE.

37
00:01:07,716 --> 00:01:09,650
I'VE BEEN TRYING AND I DON'T HOW

38
00:01:09,651 --> 00:01:12,453
MANY WAYS TO EXPLAIN TO MY

39
00:01:12,454 --> 00:01:14,022
AUDIENCE WHY IT IS DIFFERENT NOW

40
00:01:14,023 --> 00:01:16,257
THAN IT WAS 15 YEARS AGO, OR 20.

41
00:01:16,258 --> 00:01:18,993
AND I DO IT BY TRYING TO ANALYZE

42
00:01:18,994 --> 00:01:19,527
WHO THE LEFT IS.

43
00:01:19,528 --> 00:01:23,064
WHAT THEY HAVE BECOME.

44
00:01:23,065 --> 00:01:26,834
I AM NAIVE IN MANY WAYS.

45
00:01:26,835 --> 00:01:29,470
>> Sean: I MIGHT TAKE AN

46
00:01:29,471 --> 00:01:30,238
OBJECTION TO RUSH BEING NAIVE.

47
00:01:30,239 --> 00:01:30,938
>> Rush: YOU TELL ME IF THIS

48
00:01:30,939 --> 00:01:32,874
IS NAIVE.

49
00:01:32,875 --> 00:01:33,674
I LOOK AT WHAT HAPPENED DURING

50
00:01:33,675 --> 00:01:35,410
THE KAVANAUGH HEARING.

51
00:01:35,411 --> 00:01:36,411
YOU DESCRIBED RICIN ON THE STUFF

52
00:01:36,412 --> 00:01:37,712
TO SUSAN COLLINS.

53
00:01:37,713 --> 00:01:41,382
WE LOOKED AT THE LITERAL MOB

54
00:01:41,383 --> 00:01:42,917
BEHAVIOR, THAT WAS INSPIRED,

55
00:01:42,918 --> 00:01:46,054
BOUGHT AND PAID FOR, BY THE

56
00:01:46,055 --> 00:01:47,021
DEMOCRAT PARTY, THE MEDIA

57
00:01:47,022 --> 00:01:48,856
ENCOURAGED IT.

58
00:01:48,857 --> 00:01:53,594
IN MY NAIVE WORLD, THAT BEHAVIOR

59
00:01:53,595 --> 00:01:55,630
WOULD SECURE THE BIGGEST

60
00:01:55,631 --> 00:01:57,098
LANDSLIDE DEFEAT A POLITICAL

61
00:01:57,099 --> 00:01:57,832
PARTY HAS EVER HAD.

62
00:01:57,833 --> 00:02:00,234
IN A SANE WORLD, WHERE DECENT

63
00:02:00,235 --> 00:02:02,136
PEOPLE ARE THE MAJORITY, THAT

64
00:02:02,137 --> 00:02:04,072
WOULD BE REJECTED OUT OF HAND.

65
00:02:04,073 --> 00:02:05,273
IT WOULDN'T EVEN BE CONSIDERED

66
00:02:05,274 --> 00:02:05,640
RELEVANT.

67
00:02:05,641 --> 00:02:06,841
AND THE PEOPLE OF THIS COUNTRY

68
00:02:06,842 --> 00:02:09,277
WOULD WANT TO GET RID OF THAT AS

69
00:02:09,277 --> 00:02:11,412
QUICKLY AS THEY COULD.

70
00:02:11,413 --> 00:02:13,648
YET, IT MAY BE CLOSE TO 50% OF

71
00:02:13,649 --> 00:02:14,082
THE COUNTRY.

72
00:02:14,083 --> 00:02:15,850
I DON'T THINK IT IS, AND I HOPE

73
00:02:15,851 --> 00:02:17,852
NOT, BUT THE FACT THAT IT

74
00:02:17,853 --> 00:02:19,454
CONTINUES TO SURVIVE, I HAVE

75
00:02:19,455 --> 00:02:20,188
EVOLVED A BUNCH OF THEORIES TO

76
00:02:20,189 --> 00:02:22,256
EXPLAIN IT.

77
00:02:22,257 --> 00:02:23,624
AND I REALLY THINK -- BY THE

78
00:02:23,625 --> 00:02:25,493
WAY, INTERRUPT ANY TIME WITH

79
00:02:25,494 --> 00:02:26,094
QUESTIONS.

80
00:02:26,095 --> 00:02:27,462
>> Sean: NOW, YOU ARE DOING

81
00:02:27,463 --> 00:02:27,762
GREAT.

82
00:02:27,763 --> 00:02:30,565
>> Rush: I REALLY THINK THAT

83
00:02:30,566 --> 00:02:32,934
ALL OF THIS -- THE VAST MAJORITY

84
00:02:32,935 --> 00:02:35,136
OF IT, STILL, SEAN, REVOLVES

85
00:02:35,137 --> 00:02:38,039
AROUND ONE OF THE AGE-OLD

86
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:39,273
ARGUMENTS THAT LEFT VERSUS RIGHT

87
00:02:39,274 --> 00:02:40,875
HAS HAD, THAT IS ROLE OF

88
00:02:40,876 --> 00:02:41,275
GOVERNMENT.

89
00:02:41,276 --> 00:02:42,376
IN THEIR LIVES.

90
00:02:42,377 --> 00:02:45,446
THE PEOPLE ON THE LEFT, I READ

91
00:02:45,447 --> 00:02:46,647
SOME OF WHAT JIM GARRITY AND

92
00:02:46,648 --> 00:02:47,882
NATIONAL REVIEW, ABOUT A MONTH

93
00:02:47,883 --> 00:02:49,016
AGO NOW, AND IT JUST STRUCK ME,

94
00:02:49,017 --> 00:02:51,252
BECAUSE I THINK IT IS DEAD ON.

95
00:02:51,253 --> 00:02:53,020
I WILL PARAPHRASE WHAT HE SAID.

96
00:02:53,021 --> 00:02:54,956
HE SAID, WHAT HAS HAPPENED, IN

97
00:02:54,957 --> 00:02:56,157
HIS VIEW -- I ENDORSE THIS EVEN

98
00:02:56,158 --> 00:02:57,158
MORE THAN HE DOES PETER THINK IT

99
00:02:57,159 --> 00:02:58,960
IS A BIGGER POINT THAT HE MADE

100
00:02:58,961 --> 00:02:59,227
IT.

101
00:02:59,228 --> 00:03:01,362
THESE PEOPLE ON THE LEFT, THE

102
00:03:01,363 --> 00:03:04,899
MOB BEHAVIOR, IS REALLY A SERIES

103
00:03:04,900 --> 00:03:07,135
OF PSYCHOLOGICAL DISORDERS THAT

104
00:03:07,136 --> 00:03:10,538
HAVE TAKEN OVER POLITICS.

105
00:03:10,539 --> 00:03:14,242
WE HAVE POLITICIZED

106
00:03:14,243 --> 00:03:14,976
PSYCHOLOGICAL DISORDERS TO THE

107
00:03:14,977 --> 00:03:17,245
POINTING OUT THAT THEY HAVE

108
00:03:17,246 --> 00:03:18,446
BECOME THE OBJECTIVE OF THE

109
00:03:18,447 --> 00:03:18,946
DEMOCRATIC PARTY.

110
00:03:18,947 --> 00:03:21,849
ASSAULTING ALL OF THESE

111
00:03:21,850 --> 00:03:22,450
DISPARATE, SEPARATE

112
00:03:22,451 --> 00:03:23,184
PSYCHOLOGICAL DISORDERS, HAVING

113
00:03:23,185 --> 00:03:25,219
THE GOVERNMENT DO IT,

114
00:03:25,220 --> 00:03:27,788
BASICALLY DETERMINED OUTCOMES.

115
00:03:27,789 --> 00:03:30,558
AND GET EVEN WITH OPPRESSORS,

116
00:03:30,559 --> 00:03:31,459
THE FOUNDING MAJORITY OF THE

117
00:03:31,460 --> 00:03:31,792
COUNTRY.

118
00:03:31,793 --> 00:03:33,261
THAT IS WHAT WE ARE DEALING

119
00:03:33,262 --> 00:03:34,428
WITH.

120
00:03:34,429 --> 00:03:35,029
IF WE DON'T DEFINE THIS

121
00:03:35,030 --> 00:03:36,631
PROPERLY, WE ARE NEVER GOING TO

122
00:03:36,632 --> 00:03:37,498
BE ABLE TO OPPOSE IT.

123
00:03:37,499 --> 00:03:39,967
IF WE CONSIDER THE STUFF LEGIT,

124
00:03:39,968 --> 00:03:40,468
WHICH IT ISN'T.

125
00:03:40,469 --> 00:03:42,003
THAT IT KIND OF BEHAVIOR IS NOT

126
00:03:42,004 --> 00:03:42,637
LEGITIMATE.

127
00:03:42,638 --> 00:03:43,371
WE DO NOT WANT TO COUNTRY BASED

128
00:03:43,372 --> 00:03:45,439
ON THAT KIND -- WE DON'T WANT

129
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:48,676
PEOPLE WINNING ELECTIONS BASED

130
00:03:48,677 --> 00:03:50,845
ON MOBS AND VIOLENCE.

131
00:03:50,846 --> 00:03:52,180
THINK IF THAT HAPPENS.

132
00:03:52,181 --> 00:03:53,114
IF THEY WIN THE ELECTION BASED

133
00:03:53,115 --> 00:03:55,650
ON THIS KIND OF BEHAVIOR --

134
00:03:55,651 --> 00:03:59,153
EXACTLY RIGHT.

135
00:03:59,154 --> 00:04:01,989
WHAT DO DECENT PEOPLE DO?

136
00:04:01,990 --> 00:04:04,058
DECENT PEOPLE DO NOT SPEND ALL

137
00:04:04,059 --> 00:04:05,660
DAY TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO

138
00:04:05,661 --> 00:04:06,060
BATTLE THIS.

139
00:04:06,061 --> 00:04:08,229
DECENT PEOPLE ARE LIVING THEIR

140
00:04:08,230 --> 00:04:08,963
LIVES.

141
00:04:08,964 --> 00:04:12,266
WE'VE GOT PERVERSION, INDECENCY,

142
00:04:12,267 --> 00:04:13,668
CORRUPTION COME UP AGAINST WHAT

143
00:04:13,669 --> 00:04:16,037
USED TO BE CALLED NORMALCY.

144
00:04:16,038 --> 00:04:19,640
>> Sean: HILLARY CLINTON -- WE

145
00:04:19,641 --> 00:04:21,175
CAN'T BE CIVIL UNLESS YOU GIVE

146
00:04:21,176 --> 00:04:22,443
US POWER BACK.

147
00:04:22,444 --> 00:04:24,245
ERIC HOLDER, THEY GO LOW, WE

148
00:04:24,246 --> 00:04:24,612
KICK THEM.

149
00:04:24,613 --> 00:04:28,049
MAXINE WATERS, IF YOU SEE THEM,

150
00:04:28,050 --> 00:04:31,852
CREATE A CROWD.

151
00:04:31,853 --> 00:04:33,854
GO TELL THEM, FOLLOW THEM INTO

152
00:04:33,855 --> 00:04:34,555
DEPARTMENT STORES AND GROCERY

153
00:04:34,556 --> 00:04:36,390
STORES AND GAS STATIONS.

154
00:04:36,391 --> 00:04:39,660
YOU ARE NOT WANTED ANYWHERE

155
00:04:39,661 --> 00:04:39,994
ANYMORE.

156
00:04:39,995 --> 00:04:43,030
AND WE SAW PAM BONDI, SECRETARY

157
00:04:43,031 --> 00:04:45,466
NIELSEN, AND WE SAW SARAH

158
00:04:45,467 --> 00:04:48,236
SANDERS, TED CRUZ AND HIS WIFE,

159
00:04:48,237 --> 00:04:49,637
HEIDI, MITCH McCONNELL, I

160
00:04:49,638 --> 00:04:50,571
THINK RAND IS RIGHT.

161
00:04:50,572 --> 00:04:51,739
SOMEBODY IS GOING TO GET HURT

162
00:04:51,740 --> 00:04:52,039
HERE.

163
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:54,842
IN THE END.

164
00:04:54,843 --> 00:04:56,978
LOOK AT, I BLAME THE PEOPLE FOR

165
00:04:56,979 --> 00:04:59,647
THEIR ACTIONS, BUT THERE IS

166
00:04:59,648 --> 00:05:01,449
CERTAINLY MARCHING ORDERS HERE.

167
00:05:01,450 --> 00:05:02,450
CONFRONT, ATTACK, GET IN THEIR

168
00:05:02,451 --> 00:05:02,850
FACES.

169
00:05:02,851 --> 00:05:03,718
>> Rush: ALL OF IT IS MARCHING

170
00:05:03,719 --> 00:05:04,652
ORDERS.

171
00:05:04,653 --> 00:05:06,254
ALL OF IT IS BOUGHT AND PAID

172
00:05:06,255 --> 00:05:06,520
FOR.

173
00:05:06,521 --> 00:05:08,823
LOOK AT THIS CARAVAN.

174
00:05:08,824 --> 00:05:10,424
WHERE IS IT?

175
00:05:10,425 --> 00:05:11,425
HONDURAS, GUATEMALA, DOESN'T

176
00:05:11,426 --> 00:05:11,759
MATTER.

177
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:13,628
SOMEBODY IS PAYING FOR THIS.

178
00:05:13,629 --> 00:05:15,062
WHERE ARE THESE PEOPLE GOING TO

179
00:05:15,063 --> 00:05:15,496
THE BATHROOM?

180
00:05:15,497 --> 00:05:18,165
WHO IS FEEDING THEM?

181
00:05:18,166 --> 00:05:21,335
2,000, 4,000 PEOPLE, KIDS, THAT

182
00:05:21,336 --> 00:05:21,769
IS THE MAGIC.

183
00:05:21,770 --> 00:05:23,004
AND THEY PUT THE CHILDREN IN

184
00:05:23,005 --> 00:05:24,772
THERE.

185
00:05:24,773 --> 00:05:26,641
WE CAN'T SEND THEM AWAY, IT IS

186
00:05:26,642 --> 00:05:28,109
SO HORRIBLE.

187
00:05:28,110 --> 00:05:31,879
IT IS ALL DESIGNED AND IT IS ALL

188
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:32,980
DESIGNED DURING THE ELECTION

189
00:05:32,981 --> 00:05:35,650
PAIRED WE HAVE THIS, WORRY ABOUT

190
00:05:35,651 --> 00:05:37,118
RAISING INTEREST RATES TO JAM

191
00:05:37,119 --> 00:05:38,252
DOWN THE ECONOMY, WAY OVER

192
00:05:38,253 --> 00:05:41,389
THERE, GUESS WHAT JUST HAPPENED?

193
00:05:41,390 --> 00:05:43,190
ROBERT MUELLER IS ABOUT READY TO

194
00:05:43,191 --> 00:05:46,560
SUBMIT HIS REPORT.

195
00:05:46,561 --> 00:05:48,929
WELL, JUSTICE DEPARTMENT RULES

196
00:05:48,930 --> 00:05:49,630
AND GUIDELINES SAY THEY SHOULD

197
00:05:49,631 --> 00:05:53,167
NOT DO IT TO IMPACT THE RESULTS

198
00:05:53,168 --> 00:05:53,634
OF AN ELECTION.

199
00:05:53,635 --> 00:05:56,537
BUT THAT DIDN'T -- COMEY DID,

200
00:05:56,538 --> 00:05:57,238
DIDN'T HE?

201
00:05:57,239 --> 00:05:58,739
HE WAS DOING EVERYTHING HE COULD

202
00:05:58,740 --> 00:05:59,473
TO HELP HILLARY, PEOPLE DON'T

203
00:05:59,474 --> 00:06:02,843
UNDERSTAND THIS.

204
00:06:02,844 --> 00:06:03,611
THESE THINGS ARE ALL PLANNED AND

205
00:06:03,612 --> 00:06:06,447
THEY ARE ALL GETTING FOCUSED

206
00:06:06,448 --> 00:06:07,248
LEADING UP TO THE ELECTION.

207
00:06:07,249 --> 00:06:08,849
PEOPLE ASK ME, WHAT CAN I DO?

208
00:06:08,850 --> 00:06:10,618
I WANT TO DO MORE THAN VOTE.

209
00:06:10,619 --> 00:06:13,054
RIGHT NOW, THAT IS THE ANSWER.

210
00:06:13,055 --> 00:06:13,821
I KNOW PEOPLE THINK THEIR VOTE

211
00:06:13,822 --> 00:06:17,058
IS NOT ENOUGH, BUT IT IS.

212
00:06:17,059 --> 00:06:20,628
TURNOUT IS EVERYTHING.

213
00:06:20,629 --> 00:06:21,929
THIS IS ALMOST AN IDENTICAL

214
00:06:21,930 --> 00:06:23,998
SCENARIO TO 2016.

215
00:06:23,999 --> 00:06:26,467
THEY THINK, SEAN, THEY REALLY

216
00:06:26,468 --> 00:06:30,071
DO -- SOME OF THIS IS HOPE, BUT

217
00:06:30,072 --> 00:06:31,972
A LOT OF AMERICANS THAT VOTED

218
00:06:31,973 --> 00:06:34,175
FOR TRUMP REGRET IT.

219
00:06:34,176 --> 00:06:36,677
TO APOLOGIZE FOR THE MISTAKE OF

220
00:06:36,678 --> 00:06:39,914
VOTING -- THEY CAN'T WAIT TO GO

221
00:06:39,915 --> 00:06:40,815
OUT AND APOLOGIZE.

222
00:06:40,816 --> 00:06:44,819
THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS, SINCE

223
00:06:44,820 --> 00:06:45,653
BARACK OBAMA, THE

224
00:06:45,654 --> 00:06:46,821
DEMOCRATIC PARTY HAS BEEN LOSING

225
00:06:46,822 --> 00:06:47,588
ELECTION PAIRED STARTING IN 2010

226
00:06:47,589 --> 00:06:49,290
COME ALL THE WAY UP TO 2016, THE

227
00:06:49,291 --> 00:06:52,760
DEMOCRAT PARTY HAS LOST 1200

228
00:06:52,761 --> 00:06:53,094
SEATS.

229
00:06:53,095 --> 00:06:54,829
NATIONAL, STATE, LOCAL.

230
00:06:54,830 --> 00:06:56,030
YOU HAVE TO COUNT ALL THE WAY

231
00:06:56,031 --> 00:06:57,298
DOWN TO THE DOG CATCHER, THEY

232
00:06:57,299 --> 00:06:58,232
HAVE LOST.

233
00:06:58,233 --> 00:06:59,633
THEY HAVE THE LEAST AMOUNT OF

234
00:06:59,634 --> 00:07:01,168
ELECTORAL POLITICAL POWER IN

235
00:07:01,169 --> 00:07:04,038
WASHINGTON SINCE THE '20s.

236
00:07:04,039 --> 00:07:05,439
WHERE IS THIS BLUE WAVE?

237
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:07,174
WHERE'S THE EVIDENCE THAT PEOPLE

238
00:07:07,175 --> 00:07:08,242
CAN'T WAIT TO VOTE DEMOCRAT?

239
00:07:08,243 --> 00:07:09,043
THE EVIDENCE AS THEY ARE ARE

240
00:07:09,044 --> 00:07:11,412
DOING THE EXACT OPPOSITE.

241
00:07:11,413 --> 00:07:12,646
TRUMP IS OUT THERE CONTINUING TO

242
00:07:12,647 --> 00:07:14,648
DO THE THINGS HE DID THAT WON

243
00:07:14,649 --> 00:07:15,750
HIM THE ELECTION IN 2016, ALL OF

244
00:07:15,751 --> 00:07:17,852
THESE RALLIES.

245
00:07:17,853 --> 00:07:19,320
THEY HAVE BEEN UNABLE TO GET RID

246
00:07:19,321 --> 00:07:20,454
OF HIM.

247
00:07:20,455 --> 00:07:21,856
THEY HAVE THROWN EVERYTHING AT

248
00:07:21,857 --> 00:07:23,357
US BEFORE THAT USUALLY GETS RID

249
00:07:23,358 --> 00:07:24,191
OF REPUBLICAN OPPONENTS, AND

250
00:07:24,192 --> 00:07:27,027
NOTHING HAS WORKED.

251
00:07:27,028 --> 00:07:28,295
AND THEY'RE JUST FRUSTRATED AS

252
00:07:28,296 --> 00:07:30,064
THEY CAN BE, AND I THINK THEY

253
00:07:30,065 --> 00:07:30,798
ARE SO OVERPLAYING THIS, AND

254
00:07:30,799 --> 00:07:33,567
THEY ARE GOING WAY BEYOND THE

255
00:07:33,568 --> 00:07:35,236
BOUNDS OF ANYWHERE NEAR

256
00:07:35,237 --> 00:07:36,237
PROPRIETY.

257
00:07:36,238 --> 00:07:37,171
WHAT THEY THINK, MOST AMERICANS

258
00:07:37,172 --> 00:07:41,242
WANT TO BE ENCOURAGED TO DO

259
00:07:41,243 --> 00:07:41,876
MOB-LIKE BEHAVIOR, GETTING

260
00:07:41,877 --> 00:07:42,410
PEOPLE'S FACES.

261
00:07:42,411 --> 00:07:43,177
I DON'T THINK PETE WE HAVE LOST

262
00:07:43,178 --> 00:07:46,280
THE COUNTRY TO THAT EXTENT

263
00:07:46,281 --> 00:07:48,249
THAT THAT WINS ELECTIONS.

264
00:07:48,250 --> 00:07:49,817
>> Sean: HOW BIG AN IMPACT --

265
00:07:49,818 --> 00:07:55,623
OHR TO ME A TIPPING POINT.

266
00:07:55,624 --> 00:07:56,824
I THINK MOST PEOPLE

267
00:07:56,825 --> 00:07:57,491
FUNDAMENTALLY BELIEVE IN THE

268
00:07:57,492 --> 00:07:59,026
RULE OF LAW, THE CONSTITUTION,

269
00:07:59,027 --> 00:08:00,961
DUE PROCESS, PRESUMPTION OF

270
00:08:00,962 --> 00:08:01,328
INNOCENCE.

271
00:08:01,329 --> 00:08:06,634
THERE WAS NONE OF THAT.

272
00:08:06,635 --> 00:08:07,568
>> Rush: LOOK HOW CLOSE THEY

273
00:08:07,569 --> 00:08:09,103
WERE TO GETTING AWAY WITH THAT,

274
00:08:09,104 --> 00:08:09,837
THOUGH.

275
00:08:09,838 --> 00:08:11,439
YOU AND I WATCHED THIS FROM A

276
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:13,207
DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVE THAN A LOT

277
00:08:13,208 --> 00:08:14,074
OF PEOPLE.

278
00:08:14,075 --> 00:08:14,809
SADLY, THERE ARE STILL A LOT OF

279
00:08:14,810 --> 00:08:16,043
PEOPLE THAT ONLY GET THEIR NEWS

280
00:08:16,044 --> 00:08:17,611
FROM WHAT WE CALL THE MAINSTREAM

281
00:08:17,612 --> 00:08:19,213
MEDIA.

282
00:08:19,214 --> 00:08:19,713
IF DONALD TRUMP --

283
00:08:19,714 --> 00:08:20,481
PRESIDENT TRUMP HAD NOT COME AT

284
00:08:20,482 --> 00:08:26,921
THAT RALLY, EXPOSED CHRISTINE --

285
00:08:26,922 --> 00:08:28,389
>> Sean: NO CORROBORATION.

286
00:08:28,390 --> 00:08:29,657
>> Rush: NON!

287
00:08:29,658 --> 00:08:33,461
THE FOUR PEOPLE SHE SAYS WHERE

288
00:08:33,462 --> 00:08:35,362
THERE -- THEY GET MAD AT TRUMP

289
00:08:35,363 --> 00:08:36,230
FOR MOCKING HER.

290
00:08:36,231 --> 00:08:37,431
HE DIDN'T MARK HER PAIRED TO

291
00:08:37,432 --> 00:08:38,666
MOCK HER, HE WOULD HAVE TO

292
00:08:38,667 --> 00:08:40,334
IMPERSONATE HER.

293
00:08:40,335 --> 00:08:41,635
BUT I CAN DO, BUT I WILL NOT.

294
00:08:41,635 --> 00:08:44,672
>> Sean: YOU ARE SHOWING GREAT

295
00:08:44,673 --> 00:08:45,639
RESTRAINT.

296
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:46,106
HE EXPOSED HER.

297
00:08:46,107 --> 00:08:48,742
TO A BUNCH OF AMERICANS WHO

298
00:08:48,743 --> 00:08:50,144
DIDN'T KNOW, BECAUSE THE

299
00:08:50,145 --> 00:08:52,046
MAINSTREAM MEDIA HAD NOT

300
00:08:52,047 --> 00:08:54,048
REPORTED ALL OF THE HOLES IN HER

301
00:08:54,049 --> 00:08:54,348
STORY.

302
00:08:54,349 --> 00:08:56,617
SO TRUMP DOES, AND IN GETTING

303
00:08:56,618 --> 00:08:57,985
TRUMP, THEY END UP REPORTING

304
00:08:57,986 --> 00:08:59,653
WHAT TRUMP SAID PAIRED THAT WAS

305
00:08:59,654 --> 00:09:00,621
THE TIPPING POINT, PLUS WHAT

306
00:09:00,622 --> 00:09:01,755
KAVANAUGH DID TO SAVE HIMSELF

307
00:09:01,756 --> 00:09:03,224
PAIRED BUT YOU ARE RIGHT,

308
00:09:03,225 --> 00:09:04,058
PERCEPTION OF INNOCENCE GONE

309
00:09:04,059 --> 00:09:05,993
PAIRED THEY WERE CLOSE TO

310
00:09:05,994 --> 00:09:06,994
KILLING MATT BY INTIMIDATING

311
00:09:06,995 --> 00:09:09,897
REPUBLICAN ON THAT COMMITTEE

312
00:09:09,898 --> 00:09:10,264
COMMITTEE.

313
00:09:10,265 --> 00:09:12,032
BUT IT DIDN'T WORK AGAIN BECAUSE

314
00:09:12,033 --> 00:09:13,167
I BELIEVE THE PRESIDENT CAME IN

315
00:09:13,168 --> 00:09:14,101
AND SAVE THE DAY.

316
00:09:14,102 --> 00:09:16,270
>> Sean: LOOK, I DON'T HAVE A

317
00:09:16,271 --> 00:09:17,238
CRYSTAL BALL.

318
00:09:17,239 --> 00:09:19,373
I ALWAYS THOUGHT AND BELIEVED IN

319
00:09:19,374 --> 00:09:22,743
MY HEART THE MEDIA IS WRONG,

320
00:09:22,744 --> 00:09:23,244
TRUMP CAN WIN.

321
00:09:23,245 --> 00:09:25,679
YOU CAN SEE IT, YOU CAN FEEL IT.

322
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:28,015
I DON'T KNOW WHO IS GOING TO RUN

323
00:09:28,016 --> 00:09:28,782
AGAINST OBAMA AND '08.

324
00:09:28,783 --> 00:09:31,619
YOU SAW THE CROWDS, HE SAW THE

325
00:09:31,620 --> 00:09:32,319
ENTHUSIASM, IN THAT CASE, I

326
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:35,222
THINK IT WAS A LOT OF HYPE AND

327
00:09:35,223 --> 00:09:37,191
NO CHANGE, TYPICAL LEFT-WING

328
00:09:37,192 --> 00:09:37,558
POLICIES.

329
00:09:37,559 --> 00:09:38,592
YOU PREDICTED TO ME THAT IT

330
00:09:38,593 --> 00:09:41,629
WOULD FAIL, AND IT DID FAIL.

331
00:09:41,630 --> 00:09:42,296
BUT SOMETHING IS DIFFERENT

332
00:09:42,297 --> 00:09:43,998
PAIRED PRESIDENT TRUMP -- YOU

333
00:09:43,999 --> 00:09:46,834
COULD SEE BUILDING MOMENTUM.

334
00:09:46,835 --> 00:09:50,237
AND NOW WE HAVE THESE MIDTERMS.

335
00:09:50,238 --> 00:09:51,639
FLORIDA, THEY COULD PICK UP A

336
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:52,106
SENATE SEAT.

337
00:09:52,107 --> 00:09:54,041
I THINK YOU COULD PICK ONE UP IN

338
00:09:54,042 --> 00:09:54,608
MISSOURI.

339
00:09:54,609 --> 00:09:56,410
I THINK HE WILL HOLD NEVADA.

340
00:09:56,411 --> 00:10:01,015
I THINK HE WILL WIN IN ARIZONA.

341
00:10:01,016 --> 00:10:02,483
NORTH DAKOTA, INDIANA, ALL

342
00:10:02,484 --> 00:10:04,118
POTENTIAL PICKUPS, WHERE I WOULD

343
00:10:04,119 --> 00:10:04,985
WORRY ABOUT MORTGAGE THE HOUSE.

344
00:10:04,986 --> 00:10:07,421
I DON'T HAVE A FEEL.

345
00:10:07,422 --> 00:10:09,223
>> Rush: IT IS HARD, SO MANY

346
00:10:09,224 --> 00:10:09,790
SEATS THERE.

347
00:10:09,791 --> 00:10:12,026
SO MANY VARIABLES AND VICTORIES.

348
00:10:12,027 --> 00:10:16,030
BUT LET'S LOOK AT THIS IN THE

349
00:10:16,031 --> 00:10:16,730
MACRO WAY.

350
00:10:16,731 --> 00:10:17,798
LET'S COMPARE THIS -- YOU WANT

351
00:10:17,799 --> 00:10:20,534
TO GO TO 2008 -- LET'S GO BACK

352
00:10:20,535 --> 00:10:22,570
TO 2016.

353
00:10:22,571 --> 00:10:25,806
I KNOW YOU WERE, EARLY ON, VERY

354
00:10:25,807 --> 00:10:26,907
CONFIDENT THAT TRUMP WAS GOING

355
00:10:26,908 --> 00:10:27,608
TO WIN PAY MY STAFF HERE WILL

356
00:10:27,609 --> 00:10:30,644
TELL ME THAT TO GO DAYS -- WHEN

357
00:10:30,645 --> 00:10:32,212
I FIRST SAW THE FIRST POLLING

358
00:10:32,213 --> 00:10:32,947
AFTER TRUMP AND MILANI I WENT

359
00:10:32,948 --> 00:10:34,281
DOWN THE ESCALATOR, I SAID, HE

360
00:10:34,282 --> 00:10:36,250
IS THE NOMINEE.

361
00:10:36,251 --> 00:10:37,618
IT IS GOING TO HAPPEN, I FELT

362
00:10:37,619 --> 00:10:38,252
IT.

363
00:10:38,253 --> 00:10:39,353
YOU KNOW WHY?

364
00:10:39,354 --> 00:10:41,422
BECAUSE I KNOW THE BOND, I SAW

365
00:10:41,423 --> 00:10:42,556
THOSE RALLIES.

366
00:10:42,557 --> 00:10:43,290
I SAW THE BOND THAT TRUMP HAD

367
00:10:43,291 --> 00:10:45,826
WITH HIS VOTERS.

368
00:10:45,827 --> 00:10:47,127
THE MEDIA DIDN'T CREATE THAT.

369
00:10:47,128 --> 00:10:49,630
HE DID.

370
00:10:49,631 --> 00:10:51,865
I DID VERSIONS OF THAT WHEN MY

371
00:10:51,866 --> 00:10:53,167
SHOW STARTED TRAVELING AROUND,

372
00:10:53,168 --> 00:10:54,768
48 WEEKENDS A YEAR FOR THE FIRST

373
00:10:54,769 --> 00:10:55,970
TWO YEARS, TRYING TO GET MY

374
00:10:55,971 --> 00:10:57,371
RADIO SHOW ESTABLISHED.

375
00:10:57,372 --> 00:11:00,407
I SAW SIMILAR SUCCESS TRACK.

376
00:11:00,408 --> 00:11:01,408
AND NOBODY CAN BLOW UP THAT BOND

377
00:11:01,409 --> 00:11:04,411
THAT TRUMP VOTERS HAVE, BUT

378
00:11:04,412 --> 00:11:06,180
WASHINGTON ESTABLISHMENT, TO

379
00:11:06,181 --> 00:11:07,581
THIS DAY, DOES NOT UNDERSTAND

380
00:11:07,582 --> 00:11:08,649
DONALD TRUMP HERE THEY DON'T

381
00:11:08,650 --> 00:11:09,783
UNDERSTAND HIS VOTERS, AND THEY

382
00:11:09,784 --> 00:11:11,485
ARE NOT CURIOUS TO FIND OUT WHY.

383
00:11:11,486 --> 00:11:13,787
THEY JUST RESENTED.

384
00:11:13,788 --> 00:11:14,989
AND THEY ARE STILL OPERATING

385
00:11:14,990 --> 00:11:16,090
UNDER THE SAME RULES THEY

386
00:11:16,091 --> 00:11:19,259
OPERATED UNDER IN 2016, AND THE

387
00:11:19,260 --> 00:11:20,394
PARALLELS ARE IDENTICAL HERE.

388
00:11:20,395 --> 00:11:22,796
THEY THINK I'M IN 2016, HILLARY

389
00:11:22,797 --> 00:11:24,431
IS GOING TO WIN.

390
00:11:24,432 --> 00:11:25,666
MASSIVE LANDSLIDE, MEASURING THE

391
00:11:25,667 --> 00:11:27,267
CURTAINS, HILLARY PLANNING ALL

392
00:11:27,268 --> 00:11:28,002
OF THESE THINGS.

393
00:11:28,003 --> 00:11:29,803
THE DEEP STATE GUYS BACK THEN

394
00:11:29,804 --> 00:11:30,638
ARE CONFIDENT NOBODY WILL EVER

395
00:11:30,639 --> 00:11:32,439
KNOW WHAT THEY DID, THEIR JOBS

396
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:36,443
AND CAREERS WILL BE SAFE.

397
00:11:36,444 --> 00:11:37,745
STRZOK AND ALL OF THEM, BUT THEN

398
00:11:37,746 --> 00:11:41,015
A TRUMP COMES ALONG AND WINS.

399
00:11:41,016 --> 00:11:42,816
SAME THING NOW, THEY THINK THEY

400
00:11:42,817 --> 00:11:44,018
HAVE WON THE HOUSE A MONTH AGO.

401
00:11:44,019 --> 00:11:45,219
IT IS IN THE CAN.

402
00:11:45,220 --> 00:11:46,487
THEY ARE JUST WAITING FOR THE

403
00:11:46,488 --> 00:11:49,990
CALENDAR AND THE DAYS TO GO BY.

404
00:11:49,991 --> 00:11:52,693
WHEN ALL OF THEIR OWN POINT

405
00:11:52,694 --> 00:11:55,262
DATA SHOWS THE BLUE WAVE

406
00:11:55,263 --> 00:11:55,863
SHRINKING AND SHRINKING.

407
00:11:55,864 --> 00:12:00,267
NOW YOU FIND LESS CONFIDENCE IN

408
00:12:00,268 --> 00:12:02,202
ALL OF THE REPORTING ABOUT THE

409
00:12:02,203 --> 00:12:05,005
BLUE WAVE, SO NOW WE HAVE THE

410
00:12:05,006 --> 00:12:06,407
CARE OF ON, THEY TRY KAVANAUGH

411
00:12:06,408 --> 00:12:08,842
PAIR LOOK AT ALL OF THE OCTOBER

412
00:12:08,843 --> 00:12:10,611
SURPRISES.

413
00:12:10,612 --> 00:12:11,011
POCAHONTAS.

414
00:12:11,012 --> 00:12:11,812
ELIZABETH WARREN, HOW ABOUT

415
00:12:11,813 --> 00:12:12,446
THIS, FOLKS.

416
00:12:12,447 --> 00:12:14,248
WE USED TO BE JUDGED BY THE

417
00:12:14,249 --> 00:12:15,015
CONTENT OF OUR CHARACTER.

418
00:12:15,016 --> 00:12:16,984
NOW IT IS THE CONTENT OF OUR

419
00:12:16,985 --> 00:12:17,251
DNA.

420
00:12:17,252 --> 00:12:19,086
IS THAT WITH THE DEMOCRATIC

421
00:12:19,087 --> 00:12:24,958
PARTY -- TALK ABOUT BASTARDIZING

422
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:27,561
MARTIN LUTHER KING.

423
00:12:27,562 --> 00:12:28,095
FEINSTEIN BOMBS OUT.

424
00:12:28,096 --> 00:12:29,763
AND ALL OF THESE -- BALL FOUR

425
00:12:29,764 --> 00:12:31,665
WERE ATTEMPTED, WERE PURPOSE TO,

426
00:12:31,666 --> 00:12:33,600
TO BLOW TRUMP UP, AND HE JUST

427
00:12:33,601 --> 00:12:35,035
KEEPS BEATING THEM BACK.

428
00:12:35,036 --> 00:12:36,103
AND THEY DON'T KNOW HOW TO DEAL

429
00:12:36,104 --> 00:12:36,637
WITH IT.

430
00:12:36,638 --> 00:12:38,005
THEY GET MORE AND MORE

431
00:12:38,006 --> 00:12:39,773
FRUSTRATED, MORE AND MORE ANGRY.

432
00:12:39,774 --> 00:12:42,342
>> Sean: SOME ICE AT THE END

433
00:12:42,343 --> 00:12:46,714
OF THE SHOW WILL TAKE A CLIP AND

434
00:12:46,715 --> 00:12:49,016
RUN IT.

435
00:12:49,017 --> 00:12:50,084
MY AUDIENCE LOVES TO SEE YOU,

436
00:12:50,085 --> 00:12:52,486
THANKS FOR DOING THE SHOW.

437
00:12:52,487 --> 00:12:55,389
AS DO I.

438
00:12:55,390 --> 00:12:56,423
WHAT IF THEY WIN?

439
00:12:56,424 --> 00:12:59,993
WHAT IF THE DEMOCRATS WIN?

440
00:12:59,994 --> 00:13:02,629
YOU LOVE THAT QUESTION.

441
00:13:02,630 --> 00:13:03,530
>> Rush: THE PROBLEM HERE IS I

442
00:13:03,531 --> 00:13:05,399
AM ON TELEVISION, AND I'M REALLY

443
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:06,100
TRYING TO BE PERSUASIVE, I DO

444
00:13:06,101 --> 00:13:08,001
NOT WANT TO DRAMATIZE IT.

445
00:13:08,002 --> 00:13:09,336
I DO NOT WANT TO LIE TO PEOPLE

446
00:13:09,337 --> 00:13:13,140
AND I DID NOT WANT TO FILL

447
00:13:13,141 --> 00:13:14,975
PEOPLE WITH PHONY, MANIPULATIVE,

448
00:13:14,976 --> 00:13:17,611
EMOTIONAL THINGS.

449
00:13:17,612 --> 00:13:18,946
BUT IT MIGHT SERVE TO ANSWER

450
00:13:18,947 --> 00:13:20,280
THAT QUESTION TO GO BACK -- WHAT

451
00:13:20,281 --> 00:13:22,950
IF HILLARY HAD WON IN 2016?

452
00:13:22,951 --> 00:13:25,319
STOP AND THINK OF THAT.

453
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:27,354
THERE WOULDN'T BE A ROARING

454
00:13:27,355 --> 00:13:27,788
ECONOMY.

455
00:13:27,789 --> 00:13:28,956
THERE WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN ANY CAT

456
00:13:28,957 --> 00:13:30,791
TAX CUTS, THERE WOULD NOT HAVE

457
00:13:30,792 --> 00:13:31,892
BEEN ROLLED BACK ON REGULATIONS,

458
00:13:31,893 --> 00:13:36,196
NO SWEARING OF THE DEAL WITH

459
00:13:36,197 --> 00:13:36,497
NATO.

460
00:13:36,498 --> 00:13:37,297
THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION TOLD

461
00:13:37,298 --> 00:13:38,799
THE AMERICAN PEOPLE, GET USE TO

462
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:40,801
IT, THERE IS A NEW AMERICAN

463
00:13:40,802 --> 00:13:41,568
ECONOMY, AND IT IS FLAT LINE OR

464
00:13:41,569 --> 00:13:43,203
IN DECLINE.

465
00:13:43,204 --> 00:13:45,506
AMERICA'S PAST, WE DID NOT

466
00:13:45,507 --> 00:13:47,007
DESERVE THAT.

467
00:13:47,008 --> 00:13:48,942
AMERICA WAS FOUNDED BY A WHITE

468
00:13:48,943 --> 00:13:51,578
PATRIARCHY TO SET ITSELF UP --

469
00:13:51,579 --> 00:13:52,746
PEOPLE DISCRIMINATED AGAINST,

470
00:13:52,747 --> 00:13:56,016
BUT THOSE DAYS ARE OVER.

471
00:13:56,017 --> 00:13:57,351
THE DAYS BEHIND US, DID WE

472
00:13:57,352 --> 00:13:59,620
DIDN'T DESERVE THOSE ANYWAY.

473
00:13:59,621 --> 00:14:02,422
WE HAVE A FLAT LINE ECONOMY, WE

474
00:14:02,423 --> 00:14:04,424
WERE TOLD -- OBAMA IS OUT THERE

475
00:14:04,425 --> 00:14:05,192
IN INDIANA TELLING THESE PEOPLE

476
00:14:05,193 --> 00:14:06,593
THEIR JOBS ARE NEVER COMING

477
00:14:06,594 --> 00:14:07,127
BACK.

478
00:14:07,128 --> 00:14:10,130
AND SOME IN THE AUDIENCE,

479
00:14:10,131 --> 00:14:12,633
"MR. TRUMP SAYS."

480
00:14:12,634 --> 00:14:13,700
AND OBAMA SAYS "WHAT IS HE GOING

481
00:14:13,701 --> 00:14:17,204
TO DO, WAVE A MAGIC WAND?"

482
00:14:17,205 --> 00:14:18,438
LOOK WHAT WE DID, THEY DO NOT

483
00:14:18,439 --> 00:14:20,307
WANT TO MAKE AMERICA GREAT.

484
00:14:20,308 --> 00:14:22,009
THEY RESENT THE WHOLE IDEA OF

485
00:14:22,010 --> 00:14:22,709
AMERICA BECOMING GREAT.

486
00:14:22,710 --> 00:14:24,311
THEY RESENT THE IDEA OF AMERICA

487
00:14:24,312 --> 00:14:25,379
AS A SUPERPOWER, RUNNING THE

488
00:14:25,380 --> 00:14:25,846
WORLD FOR GOOD.

489
00:14:25,847 --> 00:14:33,420
WE ARE THE GOOD GUYS.

490
00:14:33,421 --> 00:14:35,289
IF HE HAD AN WON, SEAN, I

491
00:14:35,290 --> 00:14:36,690
SHUDDER TO THINK, WITH

492
00:14:36,691 --> 00:14:37,291
HILLARY CLINTON IN THE

493
00:14:37,292 --> 00:14:38,392
WHITE HOUSE AND ALL OF HER

494
00:14:38,393 --> 00:14:40,327
CRONIES IN THE CABINET

495
00:14:40,328 --> 00:14:44,131
POSITIONS, AND THE VALIDATION OF

496
00:14:44,132 --> 00:14:49,236
ALL OF THESE ON BALL, WEIRD,

497
00:14:49,237 --> 00:14:50,704
PERVERTED, LEFT-WING BEHAVIORS

498
00:14:50,705 --> 00:14:51,271
BECOMING MORE AND MORE

499
00:14:51,272 --> 00:14:53,073
NORMALIZED, AND POLITICS AND

500
00:14:53,074 --> 00:14:54,341
GOVERNMENT ALL BEING ADDRESSED

501
00:14:54,342 --> 00:14:56,376
IN THEIR GRIEVANCES -- WE HAVE

502
00:14:56,377 --> 00:14:57,144
BECOME A COUNTRY OF NOTHING BUT

503
00:14:57,145 --> 00:15:00,414
A BUNCH OF VICTIMS CONSTANTLY

504
00:15:00,415 --> 00:15:01,815
ANGRY, DEMANDING THAT SOMEBODY

505
00:15:01,816 --> 00:15:03,116
DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT, INSTEAD

506
00:15:03,117 --> 00:00:00,000
OF ALL OF US -- AS WE USED TO
