amidst the confusion of Monday night's Israeli air strikes inside Syria there was an unforeseen consequence Syria's air defense units trying to hit Israeli s 16 fighter jets instead hit a Russian electronic surveillance plane the ill xx like the one shown here fell into the Mediterranean killing all 15 Russian servicemen on board Russia's Defense Ministry is furious blaming Israel for what it is calling hostile actions the Israeli pilots were using the Russian aircraft as a shield and pushed it into the line of fire of the Syrian defences as a result the aircraft which has a much more effective reflecting surface than the Israeli Jets was brought down by the missile defense system Israeli aviation management and the pilots of the f16 jets must have seen the Russian aircraft as it was landing from the height of 5 kilometers however they have done a provocation deliberately in Moscow Israeli diplomats were summoned to the foreign ministry and defense minister shoyu protested to his Israeli counterpart having door Lieberman on the phone but asked about the incident at a news conference with the Hungarian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin took a softer line in this case of course I would like to offer my deep condolences to the relatives of those who died speaking of your comparison to the case when a Turkish fighter jet downed our plane this was a different situation then the Turkish jet deliberately downed our plane in this case on the other hand it looks like a chain of tragic random events because in Israeli jet did not down ours the difference in tone between the Russian Ministry of Defense and Vladimir Putin suggests that the Russian president is satisfied that the point has been made and that this chain of tragic circumstances as he put it shouldn't risk what has hitherto been a pretty good working relationship between Russia and Israel the Israeli Prime Minister's office said in a statement that Prime Minister Netanyahu expressed his sorrow over the death of Russian soldiers and said that Syria was responsible for the downfall of the plane he so noted the significance of the continuation of security coordination between Israel and Russia that has prevented many losses of lives on both sides over the last three years at the moment neither leader seems willing to allow this incident to upset the status quo or reach allens al jazeera Moscow
