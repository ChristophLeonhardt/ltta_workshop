since being deported to Guatemala two months ago Ava Ordonez Lopez's lifeline has been her telephone each ring brings hope she'll hear the voice of her 17 year old son Jordan calling from 2000 kilometres away I always ask if he's okay he says yes but has his mother I know that's not true because he tells me mom my experience has been very difficult I never thought he'd be so far from me and he's hurting mother and son had left Guatemala together in May at the US border they used a raft to cross into the country then they turned themselves in to u.s. Border Patrol I thought I would find help but instead I found this very cruel law the Trump administration's zero-tolerance policy resulted in the separation of almost 3,000 children from their parents Ava was prosecuted for illegal entry and deported while her son remained in detention in the US it was very painful my intention wasn't to leave him in the United States my intention was to fight for him to fight together if a son is behind the gates of this government-funded shelter near the us-mexico border the children here are cared for they're fed they're even educated but they are not allowed to leave Jordan has been here for nearly three months despite a judge's order that all children separated from their parents at the border be reunited with their families earlier this summer the government says the delayed reunifications are due to the difficulty of tracking down more than 400 parents who like Ava had been deported without their children in Washington a democratic member of Congress called the operation a colossal mistake I know the president's policies systematically separating infants and toddlers from their families seemed to me to be a profoundly betrayal of American values the government says it has no parental information of at least five children in its care effectively rendering orphans ava's worst fear is to never see her son again letter bentham what do you think mobile I regret all of this because of the pain I've suffered all I had was my house I lost it but more important than that I lost my son the US government has yet to say when or how her son will be returned to her until then she says she thinks of nothing else Heidi Joe Castro al-jazeera
