Job interviews in Japan are an etiquette minefield
for foreigners and locals alike
what to wear?
uniformity is paramount
Plain black suit, white shirt, black bag,
tie that's any color other than black or white
always knock three times on the interviewer's
door
two knocks is for checking if a toilet cubicle
is vacant
Occupied
say "excuse me," bow and walk to the left
side of the chair
Make sure you're bowing correctly
bend forward from the hips with a straight
back
30 degrees upon entering, and 45 degrees when
you leave
sit straight and don't lean back in your chair
men, put one hand on each knee - women, keep
them in your lap
and never, ever be late.
or you may as well have stayed home
