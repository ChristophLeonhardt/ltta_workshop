1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,500


2
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:03,020
- We're pushing forward our
highly promising Strategic

3
00:00:03,020 --> 00:00:07,460
Defense Initiative, a security
shield that may one day protect

4
00:00:07,460 --> 00:00:10,312
us and our allies
from nuclear attack.

5
00:00:10,312 --> 00:00:12,770
NARRATOR: President Reagan's
vision for a Space Age missile

6
00:00:12,770 --> 00:00:15,045
shield never made it beyond
the realm of video games.

7
00:00:15,045 --> 00:00:18,535


8
00:00:18,535 --> 00:00:23,050
And that's still how people
often tend to picture it.

9
00:00:23,050 --> 00:00:26,200
Even in real life, anti-missile
systems often sound like

10
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:27,295
impenetrable forcefields.

11
00:00:27,295 --> 00:00:30,190
REPORTER: The system spotted
a missile and quickly fired.

12
00:00:30,190 --> 00:00:33,080
- 42 scuds engaged,
41 intercepted.

13
00:00:33,080 --> 00:00:37,570
- A 90% success rate in
neutralizing the missile

14
00:00:37,570 --> 00:00:38,172
threat.

15
00:00:38,172 --> 00:00:40,630
NARRATOR: But the reality is
that intercepting a supersonic

16
00:00:40,630 --> 00:00:43,600
ballistic missile hurling
through the sky is anything

17
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:46,120
but simple, let alone foolproof.

18
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:49,960
For starters, how far and how
fast a missile can go varies

19
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:51,290
widely.

20
00:00:51,290 --> 00:00:56,470
There's short range, medium
range, intermediate range,

21
00:00:56,470 --> 00:00:58,960
then, of course, the
Intercontinental Ballistic

22
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:00,940
Missile, or ICBM.

23
00:01:00,940 --> 00:01:03,790
All of them go through
multiple stages of flight.

24
00:01:03,790 --> 00:01:06,010
First is the boost phase.

25
00:01:06,010 --> 00:01:09,340
That's followed by the midcourse
phase and the final descent

26
00:01:09,340 --> 00:01:12,340
before detonation,
the terminal phase.

27
00:01:12,340 --> 00:01:15,400
To take out a ballistic missile,
you need sensors that can track

28
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:18,100
the incoming warheads
and launchers that fire

29
00:01:18,100 --> 00:01:20,880
interceptors-- special missiles
that can destroy warheads

30
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:22,960
simply by colliding into them.

31
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:25,540
But not all missile
defense is created equal.

32
00:01:25,540 --> 00:01:28,240
The US uses two different
categories to counter North

33
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:29,170
Korea.

34
00:01:29,170 --> 00:01:32,710
There's theater defense, and
there's homeland defense.

35
00:01:32,710 --> 00:01:34,540
Theater defense is regional.

36
00:01:34,540 --> 00:01:37,390
It includes the anti-missile
systems in places like South

37
00:01:37,390 --> 00:01:41,260
Korea, Japan, and Guam
that shield American troops

38
00:01:41,260 --> 00:01:44,440
and allies from short and
medium-range missiles.

39
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:47,920
For example, US bases across the
region are armed with a Patriot

40
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:52,270
PAC-3, which intercepts tactical
warheads at close range just

41
00:01:52,270 --> 00:01:54,070
before impact.

42
00:01:54,070 --> 00:01:57,850
There are also 19 US warships in
the Pacific mounted with Aegis

43
00:01:57,850 --> 00:02:00,640
naval defense radar
and launchers.

44
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:03,880
The ships can fire SM3
interceptors into space to take

45
00:02:03,880 --> 00:02:07,310
out warheads in the
midcourse phase of flight.

46
00:02:07,310 --> 00:02:10,479
And there are high-tech
truck-mounted launchers in Guam

47
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:13,345
and South Korea, part of the
Terminal High Altitude Area

48
00:02:13,345 --> 00:02:15,220
of Defense, or THAAD.

49
00:02:15,220 --> 00:02:18,460
Designed to be agile and mobile,
each truck launcher carries

50
00:02:18,460 --> 00:02:22,240
eight interceptors capable of
destroying missiles 125 miles

51
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:26,130
away, inside or
outside the atmosphere.

52
00:02:26,130 --> 00:02:28,860
Experts say that the theater
defense systems are not likely

53
00:02:28,860 --> 00:02:31,650
to intercept every missile
in a real life attack,

54
00:02:31,650 --> 00:02:34,170
but they've fared
well in field tests.

55
00:02:34,170 --> 00:02:36,780
It's an entirely different
story when it comes to homeland

56
00:02:36,780 --> 00:02:38,690
defense.

57
00:02:38,690 --> 00:02:41,350
The system protecting the
continental US is called

58
00:02:41,350 --> 00:02:43,440
Ground-Based Midcourse Defense.

59
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:46,830
It has between 36 and 44
interceptors in Alaska

60
00:02:46,830 --> 00:02:50,280
and California, and so far, a
track record that might keep

61
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:51,200
you up at night.

62
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:55,560
In 18 test launches since 1999,
target missiles have been hit

63
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:57,540
only 10 times.

64
00:02:57,540 --> 00:02:58,800
What's the problem?

65
00:02:58,800 --> 00:02:59,850
A tough target.

66
00:02:59,850 --> 00:03:02,370
The system aims
to destroy ICBMs,

67
00:03:02,370 --> 00:03:06,750
which fly far higher and faster
than lower-range missiles.

68
00:03:06,750 --> 00:03:09,930
Experts say it's like trying
to hit a bullet with a bullet--

69
00:03:09,930 --> 00:03:12,810
bullets that may be flying 20
times faster than the speed

70
00:03:12,810 --> 00:03:15,330
of sound, three times higher
than the International Space

71
00:03:15,330 --> 00:03:16,770
Station.

72
00:03:16,770 --> 00:03:19,650
The task is further complicated
by the flurry of debris

73
00:03:19,650 --> 00:03:22,170
released when the nuclear
warhead separates from the rest

74
00:03:22,170 --> 00:03:24,300
of the missile in space.

75
00:03:24,300 --> 00:03:27,420
Differentiating the warhead from
the debris in the threat cloud

76
00:03:27,420 --> 00:03:31,350
is difficult. Experts say
even a rising nuclear power,

77
00:03:31,350 --> 00:03:34,950
like North Korea, is capable of
using simple decoys or multiple

78
00:03:34,950 --> 00:03:37,380
missiles to confuse the sensors.

79
00:03:37,380 --> 00:03:39,840
And this system is not even
designed to defend against

80
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:43,800
advanced ICBMs from
China or Russia.

81
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:47,380
Ground-based Midcourse Defense
is far from a magic shield.

82
00:03:47,380 --> 00:03:51,410
But right now, it's the only
system protecting the US.

83
00:03:51,410 --> 00:00:00,000
