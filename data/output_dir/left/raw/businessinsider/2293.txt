00:00:04,530 --> 00:00:07,300
welcome back Justin thanks for<font color="#E5E5E5"> coming by</font>

2
00:00:07,300 --> 00:00:09,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">thank you for having me tell us what is</font>

3
00:00:09,250 --> 00:00:11,889
hot potato so a<font color="#E5E5E5"> high level hot potato is</font>

4
00:00:11,889 --> 00:00:13,900
focused on aggregating audience around

5
00:00:13,900 --> 00:00:15,460
shared<font color="#CCCCCC"> interest</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> especially large</font>

6
00:00:15,460 --> 00:00:16,810
audiences around things that are

7
00:00:16,810 --> 00:00:18,880
happening at fixed points in time so as

8
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:20,020
a consumer you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> think of this as</font>

9
00:00:20,020 --> 00:00:22,029
saying you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> answering the question</font>

10
00:00:22,029 --> 00:00:24,910
what are you doing and hot potato makes

11
00:00:24,910 --> 00:00:26,380
it very easy to connect to other people

12
00:00:26,380 --> 00:00:27,460
who<font color="#E5E5E5"> are doing the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> same thing at the same</font>

13
00:00:27,460 --> 00:00:29,410
at<font color="#E5E5E5"> the same time you might be watching</font>

14
00:00:29,410 --> 00:00:31,509
lost you might be attending a baseball

15
00:00:31,509 --> 00:00:35,079
game you know really sports concerts

16
00:00:35,079 --> 00:00:38,079
events politics conferences all fit

17
00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:39,190
really really nice<font color="#E5E5E5"> and what am</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I doing</font>

18
00:00:39,190 --> 00:00:41,590
<font color="#CCCCCC">with it am I just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> saying what I saying</font>

19
00:00:41,590 --> 00:00:43,329
what I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> about what's going on or am</font>

20
00:00:43,329 --> 00:00:44,710
i yeah you can do a number<font color="#E5E5E5"> of things you</font>

21
00:00:44,710 --> 00:00:46,149
can ask<font color="#CCCCCC"> questions of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the audience you</font>

22
00:00:46,149 --> 00:00:48,219
can post<font color="#E5E5E5"> photos you can post videos you</font>

23
00:00:48,219 --> 00:00:49,629
can comment it's really a great<font color="#E5E5E5"> way to</font>

24
00:00:49,629 --> 00:00:51,219
feel connected to<font color="#E5E5E5"> other people who share</font>

25
00:00:51,219 --> 00:00:53,230
your interests in real time so in the

26
00:00:53,230 --> 00:00:54,699
business this<font color="#E5E5E5"> has kind of been called</font>

27
00:00:54,699 --> 00:00:56,199
the back channel for a while and

28
00:00:56,199 --> 00:00:58,179
traditionally at least over the past few

29
00:00:58,179 --> 00:00:59,829
years this is somewhere that twitter has

30
00:00:59,829 --> 00:01:02,829
actually had a really<font color="#E5E5E5"> nice advantage</font>

31
00:01:02,829 --> 00:01:04,330
getting people<font color="#CCCCCC"> to talk during</font>

32
00:01:04,330 --> 00:01:06,430
conferences at events about<font color="#E5E5E5"> TV shows</font>

33
00:01:06,430 --> 00:01:08,470
about sporting events what do<font color="#CCCCCC"> you do</font>

34
00:01:08,470 --> 00:01:10,420
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> Twitter does not do and where do</font>

35
00:01:10,420 --> 00:01:12,970
you kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of add more so Twitter you know</font>

36
00:01:12,970 --> 00:01:14,860
is a very very persistent use case it

37
00:01:14,860 --> 00:01:16,090
was one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the reasons we got excited</font>

38
00:01:16,090 --> 00:01:17,080
about about starting the business

39
00:01:17,080 --> 00:01:20,200
historically you could use a hashtag or

40
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:21,940
a pound sign and in a word to kind of

41
00:01:21,940 --> 00:01:23,950
classify a tweet as fitting into a

42
00:01:23,950 --> 00:01:26,050
particular<font color="#E5E5E5"> category so could say I'm at</font>

43
00:01:26,050 --> 00:01:28,690
you know at Ted I could put pound<font color="#E5E5E5"> Ted in</font>

44
00:01:28,690 --> 00:01:30,820
my tweet and then that didn't sort of

45
00:01:30,820 --> 00:01:32,620
implies that's a tweet about Ted from a

46
00:01:32,620 --> 00:01:35,350
person who's there we kind of switch

47
00:01:35,350 --> 00:01:36,640
that around a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little bit with hot potato</font>

48
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:38,800
we think it's sort of might be a bit

49
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:41,500
easier<font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a user to find that event Ted</font>

50
00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:44,230
and then go<font color="#CCCCCC"> into a stream of commentary</font>

51
00:01:44,230 --> 00:01:46,570
and media that's focused on Ted

52
00:01:46,570 --> 00:01:48,550
explicitly so one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the one of the</font>

53
00:01:48,550 --> 00:01:50,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">challenges with with twitter is when</font>

54
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:52,150
<font color="#CCCCCC">you're say watching</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> superbowl and</font>

55
00:01:52,150 --> 00:01:53,110
you want to see all the tweets about a

56
00:01:53,110 --> 00:01:54,730
<font color="#CCCCCC">superbowl becomes very difficult to</font>

57
00:01:54,730 --> 00:01:56,680
filter that based on your friends your

58
00:01:56,680 --> 00:01:58,360
location and<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> number</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of another of</font>

59
00:01:58,360 --> 00:02:00,460
other aspects that you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know we think are</font>

60
00:02:00,460 --> 00:02:02,440
so you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> bringing me that message is</font>

61
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:04,210
based on what sort of things based<font color="#E5E5E5"> on</font>

62
00:02:04,210 --> 00:02:05,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">your interests we're going to filter and</font>

63
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:07,120
give you the most relevant messages for

64
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:09,038
you based on your<font color="#E5E5E5"> social graph based on</font>

65
00:02:09,038 --> 00:02:10,508
your location based on a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit of</font>

66
00:02:10,508 --> 00:02:12,129
demographic data about you potential so

67
00:02:12,129 --> 00:02:14,130
<font color="#CCCCCC">I'll see stuff that my friends that</font>

68
00:02:14,130 --> 00:02:15,990
actually friends with are saying exactly

69
00:02:15,990 --> 00:02:17,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">or you'll see stuff that the audience</font>

70
00:02:17,460 --> 00:02:19,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">thinks is really interesting so if a</font>

71
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:21,060
particular message has received a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

72
00:02:21,060 --> 00:02:23,700
commentary around it in<font color="#E5E5E5"> response to it</font>

73
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:25,350
or a lot of likes will distribute that

74
00:02:25,350 --> 00:02:26,970
more widely amongst<font color="#E5E5E5"> the audience too</font>

75
00:02:26,970 --> 00:02:28,650
obvious places where this could be very

76
00:02:28,650 --> 00:02:30,720
strong mobile and you have an<font color="#CCCCCC"> iPhone app</font>

77
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:32,280
and you could<font color="#E5E5E5"> tell me how strong mobile</font>

78
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:34,680
is doing but also the iPad which is new

79
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:37,710
and still not in a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of poems but you</font>

80
00:02:37,710 --> 00:02:39,150
know I've found in the last few<font color="#CCCCCC"> weeks</font>

81
00:02:39,150 --> 00:02:41,130
using one that when I'm sitting on the

82
00:02:41,130 --> 00:02:43,020
couch<font color="#CCCCCC"> watching TV or basically</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> doing</font>

83
00:02:43,020 --> 00:02:45,060
anything that's what is on my<font color="#E5E5E5"> left</font>

84
00:02:45,060 --> 00:02:47,760
absolutely you and me both so we have an

85
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:49,470
iphone app today and actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

86
00:02:49,470 --> 00:02:51,570
universal binary that runs on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the iPad</font>

87
00:02:51,570 --> 00:02:53,820
as well which we rolled out just a

88
00:02:53,820 --> 00:02:55,710
couple<font color="#E5E5E5"> of weeks</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ago and it's been a</font>

89
00:02:55,710 --> 00:02:57,300
really really great use case for it

90
00:02:57,300 --> 00:02:59,190
we're doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> mobile web still a bit of a</font>

91
00:02:59,190 --> 00:03:01,320
work in progress right now but over the

92
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:02,790
next few weeks we're going to be doing a

93
00:03:02,790 --> 00:03:04,890
pretty big release totally new iphone

94
00:03:04,890 --> 00:03:07,350
app mobile web interface and<font color="#E5E5E5"> a new web</font>

95
00:03:07,350 --> 00:03:08,670
interface as<font color="#CCCCCC"> well which we're pretty</font>

96
00:03:08,670 --> 00:03:10,230
excited about really just focused on

97
00:03:10,230 --> 00:03:12,600
making the whole experience<font color="#E5E5E5"> simpler</font>

98
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:14,490
easier and more fun for<font color="#E5E5E5"> our users and</font>

99
00:03:14,490 --> 00:03:16,950
this is one of those things that is a

100
00:03:16,950 --> 00:03:18,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">great tool if you remember to use it and</font>

101
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:21,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">it seems to me</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that this is also a tool</font>

102
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,490
that TV networks<font color="#CCCCCC"> sports sports leagues</font>

103
00:03:23,490 --> 00:03:26,220
other live event companies could really

104
00:03:26,220 --> 00:03:27,780
they've always been looking<font color="#CCCCCC"> for a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> back</font>

105
00:03:27,780 --> 00:03:29,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">channel this could solve a need with</font>

106
00:03:29,550 --> 00:03:31,020
them so how do you kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of link up with</font>

107
00:03:31,020 --> 00:03:33,030
big media companies sports leagues and

108
00:03:33,030 --> 00:03:34,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">you know have them promote you and also</font>

109
00:03:34,740 --> 00:03:37,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">act as a service for them I think it's</font>

110
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:38,790
really straightforward you get it for a

111
00:03:38,790 --> 00:03:40,860
large media company or<font color="#CCCCCC"> sports league for</font>

112
00:03:40,860 --> 00:03:43,590
example this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> an opportunity for you</font>

113
00:03:43,590 --> 00:03:46,110
to really better reach communicate with

114
00:03:46,110 --> 00:03:48,660
and hopefully entertain your audience

115
00:03:48,660 --> 00:03:51,150
during your event you could set up a

116
00:03:51,150 --> 00:03:53,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">Facebook page or you know a Twitter</font>

117
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:54,360
account we<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't really get</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

118
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:56,130
visceral response people who are

119
00:03:56,130 --> 00:03:57,810
immediately they're reacting to two

120
00:03:57,810 --> 00:03:59,400
what's going<font color="#CCCCCC"> on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I think that the use</font>

121
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:00,870
case for it fits into two great

122
00:04:00,870 --> 00:04:03,240
categories one<font color="#E5E5E5"> of which is leveraging</font>

123
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:04,530
the fact you have access to this

124
00:04:04,530 --> 00:04:06,120
audience as a consumer you might ask a

125
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:07,680
question and get responses back from a

126
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:09,240
number<font color="#CCCCCC"> of people</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> who are interested</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font>

127
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:12,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">the same thing and two is really this</font>

128
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:14,220
shared context and reaction when you<font color="#E5E5E5"> get</font>

129
00:04:14,220 --> 00:04:15,420
excited<font color="#CCCCCC"> about something</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that's happened</font>

130
00:04:15,420 --> 00:04:16,738
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> first thing you want to do</font>

131
00:04:16,738 --> 00:04:17,790
is share that with somebody

132
00:04:17,790 --> 00:04:19,260
that you know is interested in<font color="#E5E5E5"> so how do</font>

133
00:04:19,260 --> 00:04:21,300
you convince these big companies that

134
00:04:21,300 --> 00:04:23,790
you the new guy is worth doing business

135
00:04:23,790 --> 00:04:25,530
with you know we build a product that

136
00:04:25,530 --> 00:04:27,270
distributes<font color="#CCCCCC"> the distributes itself you</font>

137
00:04:27,270 --> 00:04:28,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">know we don't fundamentally believe will</font>

138
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:31,440
ultimately be successful if we don't

139
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:33,570
have a<font color="#E5E5E5"> product that users just want to</font>

140
00:04:33,570 --> 00:04:36,240
use independent<font color="#CCCCCC"> of any actual promotion</font>

141
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:39,060
of it via via media brand but you know

142
00:04:39,060 --> 00:04:41,310
we so far have we've done<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> couple of</font>

143
00:04:41,310 --> 00:04:42,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">things we did a promotion with AT&T</font>

144
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:44,310
around march madness which which went

145
00:04:44,310 --> 00:04:45,990
really nicely and working on some new

146
00:04:45,990 --> 00:04:48,510
stuff actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ipad specifically</font>

147
00:04:48,510 --> 00:04:50,820
with some potential partners that<font color="#CCCCCC"> were</font>

148
00:04:50,820 --> 00:04:52,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">excited</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about i think the premise really</font>

149
00:04:52,530 --> 00:04:55,320
is you know if<font color="#CCCCCC"> people are interested in</font>

150
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:56,610
sharing what they're doing with their

151
00:04:56,610 --> 00:04:58,590
friends and potentially with with brands

152
00:04:58,590 --> 00:05:00,660
as well this it's a really really nice

153
00:05:00,660 --> 00:05:02,160
intersection so you know the product
