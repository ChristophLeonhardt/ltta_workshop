3
00:00:04,290 --> 00:00:06,420
course<font color="#E5E5E5"> now I want to talk about it so</font>

4
00:00:06,420 --> 00:00:07,980
sorry if you didn't get<font color="#E5E5E5"> to go or if you</font>

00:00:09,750 --> 00:00:13,019
otherwise<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> promises the last time so</font>

7
00:00:13,019 --> 00:00:14,730
this was my very<font color="#E5E5E5"> first vid con and I</font>

8
00:00:14,730 --> 00:00:17,250
also went completely alone all by myself

9
00:00:17,250 --> 00:00:21,060
and I had kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of an amazing time I got</font>

10
00:00:21,060 --> 00:00:23,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">to go to some really inspiring panels</font>

11
00:00:23,130 --> 00:00:26,789
say some fantastic music I stayed in a

12
00:00:26,789 --> 00:00:28,619
hotel with strangers and I didn't get

13
00:00:28,619 --> 00:00:31,349
taken I ate a<font color="#CCCCCC"> doughnut too much claim</font>

14
00:00:31,349 --> 00:00:33,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">one that later I also got to meet a</font>

15
00:00:33,870 --> 00:00:35,610
bunch<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> people whose work I really</font>

16
00:00:35,610 --> 00:00:38,550
admire and meet people that I'd<font color="#E5E5E5"> only</font>

17
00:00:38,550 --> 00:00:41,219
found through<font color="#CCCCCC"> Facebook groups or Twitter</font>

18
00:00:41,219 --> 00:00:43,890
or tumblr so for<font color="#CCCCCC"> all of the top what's</font>

19
00:00:43,890 --> 00:00:46,110
going on about VidCon just being way too

20
00:00:46,110 --> 00:00:49,289
big this year<font color="#CCCCCC"> I disagree i think there</font>

21
00:00:49,289 --> 00:00:52,289
are still really small and quiet and

22
00:00:52,289 --> 00:00:55,710
intimate places and just genuine

23
00:00:55,710 --> 00:00:57,989
authentic connection to be had at VidCon

24
00:00:57,989 --> 00:00:59,670
would<font color="#CCCCCC"> it probably have been more</font>

25
00:00:59,670 --> 00:01:01,170
comfortable<font color="#E5E5E5"> if there are fewer people</font>

26
00:01:01,170 --> 00:01:03,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">there yes would it have been better if</font>

27
00:01:03,090 --> 00:01:05,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">there weren't fans there that we're</font>

28
00:01:05,670 --> 00:01:07,770
behaving inappropriately and harassing

29
00:01:07,770 --> 00:01:10,680
faders obviously but this<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of event</font>

30
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:14,040
still has so so<font color="#E5E5E5"> many good</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> things to</font>

31
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:16,640
offer or something so special about

32
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:19,110
getting to interact with people and talk

33
00:01:19,110 --> 00:01:20,820
about the creative process and about

34
00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:23,509
things that you like and enjoy and just

35
00:01:23,509 --> 00:01:26,970
everywhere I went I saw little pockets

36
00:01:26,970 --> 00:01:30,720
of people either sharing food or playing

37
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:33,659
card games or board games together or

38
00:01:33,659 --> 00:01:35,610
sharing a power strip so that other

39
00:01:35,610 --> 00:01:37,140
people can charge their phones and

40
00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:38,440
talking that way

41
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:40,540
and there were<font color="#E5E5E5"> all sorts of little</font>

42
00:01:40,540 --> 00:01:42,610
unofficial meet up so that people

43
00:01:42,610 --> 00:01:44,860
tweeted out or tumbled and just got

44
00:01:44,860 --> 00:01:46,600
together to<font color="#CCCCCC"> share a common interest</font>

45
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:49,450
outside of all the big crowds one of

46
00:01:49,450 --> 00:01:51,220
those that I'm actually really bummed

47
00:01:51,220 --> 00:01:53,740
that i missed was a storytelling circle

48
00:01:53,740 --> 00:01:55,540
that was called together<font color="#E5E5E5"> by a buzz</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> lee</font>

49
00:01:55,540 --> 00:01:58,120
of lovely founder<font color="#E5E5E5"> grail / the Creator</font>

50
00:01:58,120 --> 00:02:00,760
one time and people<font color="#E5E5E5"> just got together</font>

51
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:02,620
and sat<font color="#CCCCCC"> in a circle and told stories</font>

52
00:02:02,620 --> 00:02:04,090
about their own<font color="#CCCCCC"> lives in their</font>

53
00:02:04,090 --> 00:02:06,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">experience and I mean this was two</font>

54
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:08,470
strangers so you share and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I shared and</font>

55
00:02:08,470 --> 00:02:10,990
<font color="#CCCCCC">fondle with</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that that's really genuine</font>

56
00:02:10,990 --> 00:02:13,360
human connection and the best<font color="#E5E5E5"> part of</font>

57
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:17,080
all<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think is that every single night</font>

58
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:19,210
of VidCon seems to end and a dance party

59
00:02:19,210 --> 00:02:22,150
is there a better metaphor for going to

60
00:02:22,150 --> 00:02:24,700
one<font color="#E5E5E5"> of these giant cons because dancing</font>

61
00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:27,390
can be at<font color="#E5E5E5"> the same time really</font>

62
00:02:27,390 --> 00:02:30,310
terrifying and embarrassing but also

63
00:02:30,310 --> 00:02:34,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">just so exhilarating and fun and free</font>

64
00:02:34,390 --> 00:02:39,520
and so essentially unpretentiously human

65
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:41,320
and so while it feels big<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

66
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:44,170
overwhelming I think that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the beauty</font>

67
00:02:44,170 --> 00:02:46,510
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> the brilliance of VidCon because at</font>

68
00:02:46,510 --> 00:02:49,000
the end of the day even<font color="#CCCCCC"> us internet kids</font>

69
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,630
even<font color="#E5E5E5"> us introverts all we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> really want is</font>

70
00:02:52,630 --> 00:02:56,950
to connect and<font color="#CCCCCC"> to share and to hug and</font>

71
00:02:56,950 --> 00:02:59,739
to be all in<font color="#CCCCCC"> something together so</font>
