Michael Cohen's attorney Lanny Davis told NBC News last night quote Cohen is trying to reset his life as not being Donald Trump's bullet taker or worse a punching bag for Donald Trump's defense strategy where he takes the bullets this is a turn for him it's a new resolve to tell the truth no matter what even if it endangers him the White House declined comment and referred questions to Rudy Giuliani who disputed the Cohen team's claim on Trump's use of the word cache major point is it's outrageous that someone would take his client surreptitiously it's also foolhardy for them to try to kind of yell and scream and make believe what's on the tape I agree with you the tape it's a little bit hard to hear but I assure you that we listen to it numerous numerous times and the transcript makes it quite clear at the end that President Trump says quote don't pay with cash Jonathan Lanier you also spoke to Rudy Giuliani last night what did he tell you and is it actually clear that the president's saying don't pay with cash what Giuliani told me late last night is that they have a recording and they have enhanced it he said this is a tactic that he would do as a prosecutor if he said that well I would go after the Mafia we did the same thing we would have a muffled recording and we try to bring the better sound out of it he says in that recording it was clear that the president is saying don't pay with cash of course and then they released a transcript that seems to back that up they of course have not released that actual enhanced recording so we have not heard that yeah we're just relying on the recording that Lenny Davis put out but Giuliani's argument to me was that this is still backs up the president's argument there their camp's argument but he didn't do anything wrong that he was trying to do this above board he makes the point that earlier in this conversation he heard in the tape there that they discussed maybe say they have a corporation to pay it and they're saying well that must mean that Julian's argument is that is showing if the Donald Trump then candidate Trump Michael Cohen are trying to obscure this they wouldn't have set up a corporation they wouldn't be discussing it by cheque they believe that this is a the Coens camp is trying to you know muddy the waters here and change the argument to try to attack the president and they feel very comfortable that it's but that's not the case there also said that they have 12 other tapes that they're going through they don't believe that Trump is on them but rather it's Cohen talking about Trump with third parties they have said that they will just they're debating whether to release them join hayamin and listening to that tape I don't know what you glean from it other than the fact that there are a lot of names mentioned one of the most important probably is our friend David and the question if why does the tape and so abruptly clearly the tape must be in the in control of Michael Cohen but I don't know what else you find out in that tape if you're a prosecutor neither do i and I think there's the larger could the largest questions revolve around in context exactly what what what's happening before and after who's Donald Trump talking to when he seems to be having a telephone conversation with someone before the thing starts who's in and out of the room at various times what's the reference to the Charlottesville issue that comes up twice both in the telephone conversation and then also with Michael Cohen there are a lot of questions about all of this and I'll say though that to me from the from 30,000 feet what is interesting about this most of all is that for a long time among Donald Trump's adversaries in the legal realm you had mob Muller who doesn't speak and then you had Michael avenatti who does speak a lot Michael Cohen did not have a representative who got involved in the kind of gamesmanship he now does whatever you think of Blaney Davis we're gonna give his motivations whatever you think of why he's doing this he's back and he liked Michael avenatti is a skilled practitioner of the dark arts and the garish arts of media lawyering so the president now we now are in that place and we had this back in the Clint administration we've had this another at other times where we now have Rudy Giuliani Michael avenatti Lanny Davis all engaged in nuttin all of it I don't have a problem with any of it but all of them have obscure motivations all of them are not telling precisely the truth all of them are advocating and jesting on their client's behalf and it takes us into the new and a kind of a carnival legal carnival kind of element of this story that is gonna is gonna raise we're gonna see a lot of stories like this that are gonna come out in dribs and drabs and the interpretive prisms that each side put on are gonna be in stark conflict and you're not gonna know exactly what to believe until we get into a court if we ever do right well and Rudy Giuliani has they'd already been doing that on 4th on the president yes yes so to a certain extent Michael Cohen would have been at a disadvantage yes for sure sure Betsy Woodruff my as we're trying to kind of sort through you know all of the the details of this in the context etc Jonathan was talking about exactly you know who who said that cash and and this and that the other thing my question is still why did the president's team want that out there perhaps they really do believe at the end of the day that what is that whatever they have been able to enhance on this recording is clear enough that it clears the president that's right Giuliani asserted last week that there was material on this tape that was going to be exculpatory just from listening to the tape a couple times that doesn't seem to be quite nearly as clear as Giuliani was claiming and I think that's part of the reason that the coen camp was so willing to go out on a limb last night and put this tape out there it's really interesting that both sides are sort of alleging that this tape is somehow going to be a magic bullet that clears their name that clearly isn't the case one thing I can tell you though is that Cohen's camp is increasingly aggressive that's what we're seeing from from Lanny Davis additionally from talking to a person close to Cohen last week another thing I can tell you is that people in Cohen's circle are increasingly encouraging him to affirmatively go to Robert Muller they don't know for a fact that Cohen has anything that could potentially be relevant to the Moller Pro but there's a lot of hope especially among critics of the president who are close to Cohen that he might have something that could be relevant to that investigation and they would like to see him sort of circumvent or perhaps a hopscotch over his negotiations with a Southern District of New York and go directly to the special counsel so no ratham there are a couple interesting elements of this there's the content of the tapes as we're talking about and then there's the act of releasing the tapes as John says you have Lanny Davis now out and he said quote Michael Cohen is on a new path it's a reset button to tell the truth and let the chips fall where they may so all this question about Mike Michael Cohen turn on Donald Trump well this looks like the beginning of that yeah it does so we saw in the press a couple of months ago quotes from friends attributed to you know people close to Michael Cohen who are saying he wants his legal fees paid he's willing to talk to Muller sort of what seemed like an effort to strong-arm the none of the United States through the media which is a very fraught strategy but we're beginning to see I guess the fruits of that strategy sort of materialize again back to the 30,000 foot perspective you know the cash no cash thing seems like terrain that the White House thinks is more favorable it's weeds it's difficult to navigate and it seems sort of irrelevant you know ascending to a broader perspective you see the president who denied through a spokesperson when the story came out quote the president says he never had a relationship with mcdougal that's five out wrong you know that what rests what really solidifies the fake news narrative is your ability to suspend disbelief to appeal to negative partisanship say I don't like the media I'm gonna believe the president over the media this is really asking you to believe the president over your ears and I you also have no hope Hicks as we point out four days before the election saying quote we have no knowledge of this Donald Trump on that tape two months before the election does not sound like a man who had no knowledge of this no they called it again this is an old story that is just more fake news that is a quote from an unnamed spokesperson when the story broke in February this isn't about news anymore this is about the president speaking on tape to his attorney the media is removed from this equation you know really maybe the ultimate value of this tape and there are other tapes that we haven't heard obviously maybe as many as 13 altogether it part of this tape that we just heard gets to what investigators slash prosecutors continually try to get to and in this case try to get to with the president added States and its state of mind what's his state of mind during the ongoing course of action in this case trying to figure out what to do about Karen McDougal and is there going to be a payment how much is the payment going to be what's your state of mind well yes and and again to go to to a number of points that's been made here there's a there's a conversational familiarity between the two that's clear this is an ongoing conversation that these two people are having about problems the president has in this case the fact that he's implicitly acknowledging that Karen McDougal is potentially a problem and when he says all we got to do is get through the next couple weeks there's a clear indication here that he recognizes the political peril if a relationship that he has denied having were to become public regardless of whether it's paid with cash or a check or to a vehicle or not so when I asked Michael Schmidt Michael it's a good question that was just raised a second ago this is obviously all interesting it points out ways in which the president lied toward the end of the campaign it points to potential campaign finance violations but to raise the question that Betsy would rephrase is there a place in which this story and where we think this story is headed exist in some tapes how is there a place where this story starts to overlap and cross over into the realms that Bob Muller cares about well Muller took the whole issue of Michael Cohen and his relationship with the president nice payments and that was given by rod Rhodes I'm the Deputy Attorney General to these prosecutors in New York so Muller does not own that I don't see any direct nexus between this tape and that payment and what Muller is doing but what it is is that Cohen has a General Justice Department problem and will the Justice Department allow him to deal with them together will he be able to go to the Justice Department say look I know I have this exposure in New York I may have this exposure in this Russia investigation I may not here's what I can offer what can you give me in exchange for that so that would mean that Muller would really really to complete his investigation needs to talk to Michael Cohen Michael Cohen's name is in the dossier Michael Cohen tried to arrange a business deal in Russia during the campaign if Muller is going to complete his investigation he needs to talk to Cohen so does Cohen go to the prosecutors in New York or go to Muller and say look I'm ready to make a deal to sort of settle all of this to do this all together and sort of make a global cooperation deal with the Justice Department that's the question that we have to see Emily Jane Fox as we wrap up here your sense of what Michael Cohen's team wants now Jonathan Lemire is reporting that at Giuliani said there's 12 other tapes that they're reviewing they're trying to decide whether to waive privilege on those tapes is that something that that team Cowan wants out in the open I think that there is going to be a calculated strategy about what serves Michael Cohen best going forward whether that means withholding some things so that he has cards to show in to Gators if he does decide to cooperate or if there is going to be more of this kind of drip drip drip leaking then perhaps it serves them best to set the record straight but what you have to understand is we're having this conversation about less than two minutes of an audio recording there were almost four million documents and files and electronic devices seized from Michael Cohen's home hotel room and office in April and that's not even to say what was not seized in what Michael Cohen knows and someone close to Cohen said to me over the weekend it's not what's on this recording it is the back story so this this squirmish that we're seeing between the two of them is dominating the news cycle for 24 hours imagine what's going to happen when all of those documents start getting leaked out in drips and drabs the fights will just continue and I think we're really just at the beginning of this it's the tip of the iceberg Emily Jane Fox great reporting as always you too Michael Schmidt thanks for being
