they've already brought up the timing coincidence that as we went into this hour of television I believe that our are hotter breaking news tonight was going to be about the president's attempt to move stormy Daniels lawsuit into federal court I want to switch focus to that because I it's hard to believe that the timing is coincidental tonight that the President did was was not paying attention to what was happening in this news cycle and how this announcement could change that the President of the United States is actually asking a federal court in California to take jurisdiction of stormy Daniels lawsuit against Donald Trump the President of the United States is asking the federal court to take the lawsuit away from a California state court and tonight's legal filing in federal court in California by a California lawyer representing the President of the United States claims that stormy Daniels lawsuit against Donald Trump should be moved from state court to federal court because stormy ganz is a resident of Texas Donald Trump is a resident of Washington DC in New York City and because of the multi-state locations of the parties the case should not be heard in a California state court since none of the parties live in California the legal filing says that President Trump and his lawyers are quote aware of at least 20 violations by Clifford that stormy Daniels real name of the confidential confidentiality provisions of the settlement agreement Clifford expressly agreed in these settlement agreements to liquidated damages in the amount of 1 million dollars for each breach of the confidentiality provisions which is approximated to already be in excess of 20 million dollars we are joined by phone now by stormy Daniels attorney Michael avenatti and mr. avenatti I know you learned about this when you were on a plane tonight what is your reaction to the president trying to move this case into federal court well thanks for having me I'm not at all surprised we anticipated that the president mr. Cohen might attempt to do this it's really a prelude it's an interim step if you will to where they really want to go which is arbitration they want this matter decided by a private arbitrator in a conference room in a private office building as opposed to a public courthouse that's open to the people where people can actually judge for themselves the facts and the evidence this is just more the same I mean it is consistent with the way they've treated my client for some time now they has attempted to bully her and and intimidate her and ultimately they do not want this matter public it's just that it's just that simple this is more of the same their attempts to gag and muzzle my client we're not going to stand for it it's a really striking legal filing 2cb because there you see the name of the President of the United States on the title page of this pleading in federal court and the name of the president the United States typed in there by his lawyer also has an alias beside it typed in there by his lawyer the President of the United States has a lawyer who refers to him as Donald J Trump also known as David Dennison that is how the president's lawyer represents Donald Trump in this case a client with an alias trying to to keep everything that stormy Daniel's knows about him secret well I think I think what is truly remarkable about this if we just take a step back and and really think about this for a moment I actually think this is a remarkable moment in our nation's history I don't think that there has ever been an instant and I know that's a big statement but I stand behind it I don't think there's ever been an instance in the history of the United States where you had a sitting president who undertook a personal vendetta against a private US citizen who merely was who merely was looking for an opportunity to tell her version of events and it's seeking 20 million dollars worth of damages I don't think that's ever happened before in the history of the United States it's it's fright quite honestly now your client has already spoken to 60 minutes 60 minutes has announced that they intend to broadcast that interview on I believe March 25th that presumably by the president's definition will constitute what he considers another breach or another several breaches of this agreement so according to the president's reading of the situation do you expect at the end of the broadcast of the sixty minutes interview for stormy Daniels in the president's view to be liable for another twenty or a hundred million dollars no we don't I mean the president also thinks he won the ocular vote so you know I don't know what to say but look this twenty million dollar demand or twenty million dollar claim of damages it's laughable and and you know next I guess we'll hear 50 or 100 or 200 million dollars it's it's an absolute joke we don't believe the agreement is going to be upheld and even if the agreement is upheld that liquidated damages clause it will never be upheld because it is what is called legally unconscionable which means even if the parties agreed to it and even if they read it and understood it on the pick of absolutely confident that no court will enforce a million dollar liquid is especially when the consideration monetarily was only 130 thousand dollars so this is pie in the sky it's a bullying tactic it's designed to intimidate my client and I and clearly they haven't been paying attention over the last two weeks we're not gonna pack up and go home we're not going to dismiss the case she's not going to she's not going to prevent the 60 minutes piece from airing we're gonna let the chips fall where they may we're gonna continue to strive to tell the American people what happened here and we're going to allow them to make a determination on who is shooting straight with them and who is not and it's that simple and mr. avenatti i just will go over one more point before you go and you know you got a lot of attention this morning on this network on Morning Joe well when in answer to questions you said that stormy Daniels has been threatened and that she has been physically threatened has she been threatened by anyone representing or connected to the president again I'm not at liberty to discuss that I'm confident that when people tune in to 60 minutes on the 25th of March they're gonna learn the details surrounding that threat or the threats and they are going to judge for themselves as to whether she's telling the truth and whether she's credible and at some point mr. Cohen and the president are going to have to account for their various actions associated with attempting to silence my client and I am counting the days did Michael Cohen threaten stormy Daniels I'm gonna stand by my same answer and when were those threats when were the most recent threats I'm not at liberty to discuss the details of the threats again I think when people tune in to the interview they're going to learn about Michael Evan I D really appreciate you calling in I know this was difficult for you to do I really appreciate it thank you very much hey there I'm Chris Hayes from MSNBC thanks for watching MSNBC on YouTube if you want to keep up to date with the videos we're putting out you can click Subscribe just below me or click over on this list to see lots of other great videos
