Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov has given an exclusive interview to RT speaking with Sophie Sheva Nancy he talked about some of the key issues facing Russia ranging from nuclear deterrence to the scrip out poisoning case you can watch the full interview on Friday on Sophie & Co first we we we have to remember and the starting point is the words of President Putin that Russia has nothing to do with this accident this is number one number two we're not speaking about attempt to murder to murder a Russian spy in Great Britain we're speaking about attempt to murder a British spy in Great Britain he was a British spy and he is a British spy he's not a Russian spy well he is a Russian citizen but he's not the Russian spy he was handed in to Britain as a result of exchange so why should Russia hand in a man that is of any importance or that is of any value it's unimaginable so if if he's handed in so Russia quits with him he's of zero value of zero importance go ahead so this is number one number two words of President Putin so we're not as crazy as - as to even to think about something of that kind before presidential elections and before such important that a global event as football championship number three the first blaming x' came from politicians just couple of hours after the accident a couple of hours after the accident we heard first blaming of Russia that highly likely Russia was responsible of that murder of attempted murder and now what we see we see words of experts and experts of organization four four four OPCW that say that the preliminary examining of this agent will take about three weeks as a contradictory yes it is when the United States abandoned the Treaty of anti-missile defense that was a very very serious threat for mutual nuclear deterrence and this is a basic basic element of international stability and security and since then Russia found itself as a state being under siege of attempts of neutralizing its nuclear potential nuclear capabilities thus endangering the existence of nuclear deterrence the only way and despite sending sending signals of an acceptance of this process proposing various compromises proposing cooperation in ensuring international stability unfortunately our country failed to meet reciprocity and as a result as a result the only way was to show that in any case in any case despite all the efforts of our counterpart and counterparts in this story despite their continuous efforts to build the entire entire missile shield Russia will be capable of ensuring a mutual deterrent system what happened during let's say last three or four decades anglo-saxon media they started to rule the world economically commercial media and but also political media I mean media from the United States Great Britain they are most powerful they are most influential and they have the widest possible reach in the world globally and of course this feeling of monopoly so it brings it brings a will to manipulate this monopoly so you can you can use this monopoly as a tool of delivering your point of view whether it is right or wrong it doesn't matter you can adjust it in accordance with situation to simply to manipulate the brains of people throughout the world and this is why they strongly oppose appearance of any rivals even small rivals like RT in comparison with this huge machine I sincerely believe that size doesn't matter here you can be small but you can do much much let's see more influential things that is what you are doing and that is what makes them very nervous because you are pretending you are pretending to be a rival for them and this rivalry can ruin the system of brainwash
