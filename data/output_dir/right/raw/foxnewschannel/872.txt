00:00:19,536 --> 00:00:20,237
VOTERS.

6
00:00:20,237 --> 00:00:21,071
ABBY: UNIDENTIFIED BUREAU

7
00:00:21,071 --> 00:00:22,005
SUPPORTERS SAY TRUMP

8
00:00:22,005 --> 00:00:22,839
SUPPORTERS ARE ALL POOR TO

9
00:00:22,839 --> 00:00:25,609
MIDDLE CLASS, UNEDUCATED

00:00:25,609 --> 00:00:27,377
LAZY, POS THINK HE WILL

11
00:00:27,377 --> 00:00:28,178
MAGICALLY GRANT THEM JOBS

12
00:00:28,178 --> 00:00:28,945
FOR DOING NOTHING.

13
00:00:28,945 --> 00:00:29,746
THEY PROBABLY DIDN'T WATCH

14
00:00:29,746 --> 00:00:30,447
THE DEBATES.

15
00:00:30,447 --> 00:00:32,115
AREN'T FULLY EDUCATED ON HIS

16
00:00:32,115 --> 00:00:32,849
POLICIES AND STUPIDLY

17
00:00:32,849 --> 00:00:36,853
WRAPPED UP IN HIS UNMERITED

00:00:36,853 --> 00:00:37,320
ENTHUSIASM.

19
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:37,954
PETE: JOINING US NOW TO

20
00:00:37,954 --> 00:00:40,223

GODFATHER'S PIZZA AND 2012

22
00:00:42,859 --> 00:00:43,693
PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE

23
00:00:43,693 --> 00:00:44,594
HERMAN CAIN.

24
00:00:44,594 --> 00:00:45,195
MR. KAINE, THANK YOU FOR

25
00:00:45,195 --> 00:00:46,096
BEING HERE THIS MORNING.

26
00:00:46,096 --> 00:00:47,430
>> GOOD MORNING.

27
00:00:47,430 --> 00:00:48,298
PETE: HOW DO YOU REACT TO

28
00:00:48,298 --> 00:00:49,766
THE REVELATION THAT TOP

29
00:00:49,766 --> 00:00:52,469
LEVEL FBI AGENTS CLASSIFIED

30
00:00:52,469 --> 00:00:54,170
NOT JUST THE PRESIDENT BUT

31
00:00:54,170 --> 00:00:55,105
HIS SUPPORTERS THAT WAY.

32
00:00:55,105 --> 00:00:55,972
HOW COULD THEY HAVE BEEN

33
00:00:55,972 --> 00:00:56,740
FAIR IN THE PROCESS?

34
00:00:56,740 --> 00:00:58,608
>> THIS IS AN INSULT BELOW

35
00:00:58,608 --> 00:01:03,413
THE BELT; I HAVE BEEN POOR

36
00:01:03,413 --> 00:01:04,214
BEFORE I WAS POOR.

37
00:01:04,214 --> 00:01:05,915
I KNOW WHAT POOR LOOKS LIKE.

38
00:01:05,915 --> 00:01:08,351
AND SO DID MY DAD.

39
00:01:08,351 --> 00:01:10,320
MY DAD WASN'T AROUND TO VOTE

40
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:10,820
FOR DONALD TRUMP.

41
00:01:10,820 --> 00:01:14,357
BUT HE WOULD HAVE BECAUSE MY

42
00:01:14,357 --> 00:01:16,092
DAD BELIEVED IN LESS TAXES,

43
00:01:16,092 --> 00:01:17,961
LESS GOVERNMENT.

44
00:01:17,961 --> 00:01:23,366
AND MORE INDIVIDUAL

45
00:01:23,366 --> 00:01:23,833
RESPONSIBILITY.

46
00:01:23,833 --> 00:01:24,601
MY DAD WORKED THREE JOBS

47
00:01:24,601 --> 00:01:25,535
WHEN HE HAD TO.

48
00:01:25,535 --> 00:01:26,803
I DON'T CONSIDER THAT LAZY.

49
00:01:26,803 --> 00:01:28,672
AND WE EVENTUALLY WENT FROM

50
00:01:28,672 --> 00:01:30,707
POOR TO POOR TO WHERE WE

51
00:01:30,707 --> 00:01:31,541
WEREN'T SO POOR.

52
00:01:31,541 --> 00:01:32,208
SO I DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY

53
00:01:32,208 --> 00:01:32,909
ARE TALKING ABOUT.

54
00:01:32,909 --> 00:01:35,412
ALLOW ME TO MAKE ONE OTHER

55
00:01:35,412 --> 00:01:35,712
POINT.

56
00:01:35,712 --> 00:01:37,614
I'M SURE THAT MOST OF THE

57
00:01:37,614 --> 00:01:39,783
PEOPLE IN THE FBI ARE GOOD,

58
00:01:39,783 --> 00:01:41,151
DEDICATED PROFESSIONALS.

59
00:01:41,151 --> 00:01:42,419
YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE A FEW

60
00:01:42,419 --> 00:01:43,920
BAD APPLES LIKE THE ONES WHO

61
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:45,488
MAKE THESE KIND OF

62
00:01:45,488 --> 00:01:46,022
STATEMENTS.

63
00:01:46,022 --> 00:01:47,791
I BELIEVE SOMEONE WITH THIS

64
00:01:47,791 --> 00:01:50,126
INSULTING OUGHT TUESDAY SEES

65
00:01:50,126 --> 00:01:52,629
THE WORLD ONLY THROUGH THE

66
00:01:52,629 --> 00:01:55,298
NARROW LENS OF WHAT THEY

67
00:01:55,298 --> 00:01:56,966
CAPTURE IN LIBERAL NEW YORK,

68
00:01:56,966 --> 00:01:58,802
LIBERAL D.C. AND LIBERAL

69
00:01:58,802 --> 00:01:59,235
HOLLYWOOD.

70
00:01:59,235 --> 00:02:00,870
IT DOESN'T REPRESENT THE

71
00:02:00,870 --> 00:02:01,905
LENS OF THE MEDIA FOR

72
00:02:01,905 --> 00:02:02,472
REGULAR PEOPLE.

73
00:02:02,472 --> 00:02:03,873
SO I THINK THAT THEY ARE

74
00:02:03,873 --> 00:02:05,041
LIVING IN A BUBBLE THAT THEY

75
00:02:05,041 --> 00:02:08,277
NEED TO GET OUT OF.

76
00:02:08,277 --> 00:02:09,312
GRIFF: HER MAN, THERE WERE

77
00:02:09,312 --> 00:02:11,014
FIVE AGENTS OUT OF THE IG

78
00:02:11,014 --> 00:02:12,382
REPORT REFERRED FOR

79
00:02:12,382 --> 00:02:12,949
ADMINISTRATIVE ACTION.

80
00:02:12,949 --> 00:02:14,751
THERE IS CLEARLY A CULTURE

81
00:02:14,751 --> 00:02:16,453
OF PER VASK BIAS EXISTING AT

82
00:02:16,453 --> 00:02:16,953
THE HEADQUARTERS.

83
00:02:16,953 --> 00:02:18,054
I ASK YOU THIS QUESTION.

84
00:02:18,054 --> 00:02:22,359
DO YOU DRAW NOW INTO

85
00:02:22,359 --> 00:02:23,360
QUESTION THE BIAS IN THE

86
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:25,628
MUELLER INVESTIGATION?

87
00:02:25,628 --> 00:02:26,629
>> ABSOLUTELY.

88
00:02:26,629 --> 00:02:28,598
RUDY GIULIANI SAID IT BEST.

89
00:02:28,598 --> 00:02:31,901
THE BASIS FOR GETTING THE

90
00:02:31,901 --> 00:02:35,305
AUTHORITY, THE FISA ORDER IN

91
00:02:35,305 --> 00:02:36,740
ORDER TO START THAT WAS

92
00:02:36,740 --> 00:02:37,907
FLAWED IN ITSELF.

93
00:02:37,907 --> 00:02:40,877
IF THE BASIS IS FLAWED AND

94
00:02:40,877 --> 00:02:41,244
BIASED.

95
00:02:41,244 --> 00:02:42,379
THEY REALLY SHOULDN'T BE

96
00:02:42,379 --> 00:02:44,347
ABLE GOAT IT SO, YES, IT

97
00:02:44,347 --> 00:02:45,648
DOES BRING INTO QUESTION THE

98
00:02:45,648 --> 00:02:47,117
VALIDITY OF THIS WITCH-HUNT

99
00:02:47,117 --> 00:02:48,218
CALLED THE MUELLER

100
00:02:48,218 --> 00:02:48,718
INVESTIGATION.

101
00:02:48,718 --> 00:02:49,552
ABBY: YOU KNOW, GOING BACK

102
00:02:49,552 --> 00:02:51,154
TO THAT TEXT EXCHANGE,

103
00:02:51,154 --> 00:02:52,489
CALLING TRUMP SUPPORTERS

104
00:02:52,489 --> 00:02:53,323
STUPID AND LAZY.

105
00:02:53,323 --> 00:02:54,491
IT REMINDS ME OF HILLARY

106
00:02:54,491 --> 00:02:55,525
CLINTON ON THE CAMPAIGN

107
00:02:55,525 --> 00:02:56,559
TRAIL REFERRING TO SOME OF

108
00:02:56,559 --> 00:02:58,161
THE SUPPORTERS AS A BASKET

109
00:02:58,161 --> 00:02:59,095
OF DEPLORABLES.

110
00:02:59,095 --> 00:03:01,097
WE ALL REMEMBER THAT MOMENT.

111
00:03:01,097 --> 00:03:02,899
WHAT MESSAGE DO YOU HAVE FOR

112
00:03:02,899 --> 00:03:04,701
PEOPLE TO BETTER UNDERSTAND,

113
00:03:04,701 --> 00:03:06,503
MAYBE, THE TRUMP SUPPORTERS?

114
00:03:06,503 --> 00:03:07,404
YOU ARE ONE YOURSELF.

115
00:03:07,404 --> 00:03:09,205
MANY OF THEM YOU ARE FRIENDS

116
00:03:09,205 --> 00:03:09,506
WITH.

117
00:03:09,506 --> 00:03:12,275
WHO ARE THESE PEOPLE?

118
00:03:12,275 --> 00:03:13,843
HOW BETTER DESCRIBE WHO THEY

119
00:03:13,843 --> 00:03:14,110
ARE?

120
00:03:14,110 --> 00:03:16,413
>> DEPLORABLES UNITE.

121
00:03:16,413 --> 00:03:20,150
THAT'S MY MESSAGE TO THEM.

122
00:03:20,150 --> 00:03:22,719
HERE'S WHO THOSE TRUMP

123
00:03:22,719 --> 00:03:23,319
SUPPORTERS ARE.

124
00:03:23,319 --> 00:03:25,321
I GIVE A LOT OF SPEECHES

125
00:03:25,321 --> 00:03:26,423
ACROSS THE COUNTRY I SPOKE

126
00:03:26,423 --> 00:03:28,725
TO A GROUP IN FLORIDA,

127
00:03:28,725 --> 00:03:29,526
JACKSONVILLE JUST YESTERDAY.

128
00:03:29,526 --> 00:03:32,262
HAVE YOU TWO LENSES OUT

129
00:03:32,262 --> 00:03:32,896
THERE, ABBY.

130
00:03:32,896 --> 00:03:35,865
ONE IS THAT VERY NARROW LENS

131
00:03:35,865 --> 00:03:37,867
THAT PREVENTS AMERICA AS

132
00:03:37,867 --> 00:03:39,469
DECIDED AND ALL THE NEGATIVE

133
00:03:39,469 --> 00:03:41,037
STUFF THAT GOES ON.

134
00:03:41,037 --> 00:03:43,706
THEN YOU HAVE THAT WIDE LENS

135
00:03:43,706 --> 00:03:47,243
OF THE PERSONAL PEOPLE WHO

136
00:03:47,243 --> 00:03:48,678
SUE THEM THROUGH THEIR DAILY

137
00:03:48,678 --> 00:03:48,978
LIVES.

138
00:03:48,978 --> 00:03:50,180
THOSE ARE THE PEOPLE THAT

139
00:03:50,180 --> 00:03:50,947
ELECTED DONALD TRUMP.

140
00:03:50,947 --> 00:03:52,015
THOSE ARE THE PEOPLE THAT

141
00:03:52,015 --> 00:03:52,715
ARE GOING TO CONTINUE TO

142
00:03:52,715 --> 00:03:54,751
SUPPORT HIM AND SUPPORT SOME

143
00:03:54,751 --> 00:03:56,019
OF THE REPUBLICANS, MOST OF

144
00:03:56,019 --> 00:03:57,086
THEM IN NOVEMBER.

145
00:03:57,086 --> 00:03:58,321
THAT'S THE AMERICA THAT MOST

146
00:03:58,321 --> 00:00:00,000
OF US SEE.
