I like this bunch I gotta tell you you're not gonna be backing down go get them go get them rather than molding what's our RAM a rat I heard that a long time over the last campaign its Attorney General Jeff Sessions laughing and briefly joining in on the lock her up chant that broke out during his remarks to high school students at a leadership summit yesterday hosted by a national conservative group of course echoing the lock her up chance that we heard her throughout the 2016 campaign in reference to Hillary Clinton Jeana Robin just of all the things that happened yesterday and there were many to me that's just the most obscene I mean is this just the Attorney General of the United States a chief law enforcement officer of the United States to do that in front of high school students in front of a dinner party in front of anywhere for it it just shows how unserious this administration is and this Attorney General is you know Pollyanna or whatever thank you but don't you take it seriously don't you take seriously the fact that that you're supposed to be the the the top law enforcement official of the United States of America you take it no more he's supposed to be an example to the kids in that room here's the thing it's not clear to me whether he joins in the chin well what is 100% clear is delighted oh yeah it's just the light that that's the kind of this this this the smiling giggling kind of sniggering they seems to be really just kind of really into this moment we're living the that glorious memory of the times when he was able to stand up on stage and lead the chant not just kind of giggle along with it well that's the thing though it's become one of the greatest hits it doesn't mean anything anymore exactly he's not gonna prosecute Hillary Clinton we don't believe but you go to an event you go to a trump event somewhere across the country you're gonna hear you know the value of this chant and others like it is that it really annoys the right people it's provocative and it frustrates them and it's transgressive but it isn't substantive and this is actually the turning point USA event which is a very provocative conservative group and Jeff Sessions was preceded by nikki Haley who said the precise opposite she said you aren't persuading anyone you're just making a fool of yourself didn't she say specifically this owning the libs correct yeah is what we should get rid of owning the libs and then Jeff Sessions gets up and owns the libs yeah and that's what generates the change that's where the parties I'm glad you brought that up now let me just read right here what nikki Haley said to that same group just before that she said I know it's fun and it can feel good but step back and think about what you're accomplishing when you do this talking about owning the libs being provocative real leadership is about persuasion it's about movement it's bringing people around to your point of view not by shouting them down but by showing them how it is in their best interest to see things the way you do the thing about owning the lives is that's a political strategy is it works as long as you're approaching it from position of strength if you're winning elections it can kind of work it frustrates your adversary it makes you look rational by comparison if you're losing elections and you're being provocative it just looks pathetic am i reading too much noah rothman into seeing these moments where nikki Haley it carves out some space for herself she doesn't owe anyone a thing she's happy where she is she's happy to make the points that she's making and she's positioning herself for something perhaps but she is has been a dutiful soldier and has been a very effective UN ambassador so she has nothing to prove she can say whatever she wants so meanwhile President Trump just weighed in on the Michael Cohen tape we've been talking about all morning the president tweeting moments ago what kind of a lawyer would tape a client so sad is this a first never heard of it before question mark why was the tape so abruptly terminated cut while I was presumably saying positive things I hear there are other clients and many reporters that are taped can this be so too bad let's bring in now former US attorney and former aide to Robert Muller now an NBC News law enforcement analyst Chuck Rosenburg and in Washington White House correspondent for Bloomberg News Shannon petty piece so Chuck we've been playing all morning that the part of the tape at least that we have the landing day was provided to CNN last night and played on the air what did you glean from that tape yeah so first let me answer one of the president's questions what kind of lawyer would tape his client presumably a lawyer that doesn't trust its client right now it's unusual I've not heard of it I've never done it I don't recommend it that's the kind of lawyer that might do not best practices not a best practice but if you're dealing with somebody you can trust John you know maybe it is but again not not a way to learn that I didn't learn much in law school I certainly didn't learn that to plant in the state of New York within his rights Michael Cohen hit one party to tape that commerce that's exactly right for people who don't understand your reference New York is a one-party consent state in some states you need both parties to a conversation to agree to be taped in New York you only need one so as you listen to that conversation or the the what we heard of it between then candidate Donald Trump two months before Election Day in 2016 talking with Michael Cohen what did you take away from it so it's interesting as a prosecutor and I was one for a long time I think it's relevant I don't think it's incriminate ori willie i don't think it's exculpatory at least not on its face this is something that prosecutor you know you don't just go into a courtroom and hit play you need a witness to authenticate the tape to explain that you know that's my voice Willie that's your voice I made the tape on such-and-such a day and such in such a way and it wasn't edited it's not missing anything why is there a cut at the end well I can explain that the equipment failed or the conversations stopped or somebody else walked into the room so you need context so as a prosecutor if you're if this piece of evidence to all this falls into your lap and you're looking at essentially making a case against either one of these people microc owner donald trump what are the questions the the big questions you have about context about other things what would you want to know as a prosecutor to be able to turn that into a piece of evidence oh that's a great question the first thing I'd want to do John is corroborated so they're talking about payments perhaps are their payments in what amounts and to whom right if I have bank records if I have checked if I have deposit slips all that stuff helps corroborate what's on the tape but the tape in and of itself is seldom enough right it's not a smoking gun second point I think there are a lot more tapes nobody Rob's one Bank nobody makes one tape these things tend to happen in batches or bunches and so I want to hear all the tapes and then I want a witness to tell me not just what the words are because sometimes they're hard to hear but what they mean sherman petty piece you spoke to rudy giuliani about this tape and they are you know making this very specific argument they're focusing in on the word cash and what the president intended there what else did you learn in your conversation with the president's lawyer and does this not just serve to kind of distract from this broader thing that we have learned here which is that the president did seem to know about this and realize it was and discuss it in the context of winning the election well I definitely got a sense of the defense that they're trying to lay out if this does go into a court of law or just if this is going to be something in the court of public opinion he emphasized that we don't really know what's happening just from this tape we can make inferences what they're talking about but that it doesn't signal anything one way or another but Rudy Giuliani and the rest of trumps legal team know what's on the rest of these tapes they know what's out there document wise because they have been able to go through and review it as part of this process true to flag items that are privileged they know that there were 12 tapes that involve the president that they flagged they cited privilege on this is one of them there's 11 others that I've been told our third party and Michael Cohen talking about the president but does not have the president's audio on it but they the lawyers know what is on those tapes as well and they do not have technically the ability to release those but Michael Cohen could since he is in the position of those so they definitely know that that's another shoe that could come out but those 12 tapes those are just the ones the legal team flagged as being privileged conversations there could be many many other tapes even involving the president or his audios on it that are outside the realms of privilege that they can't make any claim on so yes there could be a lot more taste out here and when the president in his tweet says I hear there's recordings he could have very easily heard those from his own legal team which has reviewed many if not all the documents that were seized in this Cowan raid to look for any privileged material and if it wasn't already clear became clear last night that with Lanny Davis representing him Michael Cohen is now on offense and all of this meanwhile potential jurors in Paul manna for its upcoming federal trial are being asked what they know about the case and if they can put all that aside to determine a verdict the group of about 70 possible jurors filled out questionnaires yesterday morning and met with the presiding judge judge TS Ellis told the group it will be asked what they have seen know and heard as well as about their law-enforcement ties prosecutors say they're calling planning called witnesses from the IRS FBI and financial crimes enforcement network the Washington Post reports manna forts attorneys had hoped to ask jurors whether they voted in the 2016 election and for other signs of their political views but the judge rejected the questions as political theater the trial is set to begin on Tuesday and is expected to last three weeks Chuck this is one of our first real windows into the Muller investigation what are you expecting from it well I'm expecting a fairly dry trial and this is a document case so we're talking about IRS agents and tax returns and bank records it's not going to be sort of a big sexy case it's gonna be interesting there's gonna be a lot of details that come out but it's not going to be sexy and it's gonna be documented after document methodically put into evidence by very very talented prosecutors also one quick comment Willy on what judge Ellis is doing in selecting a jury all you have to do is find the jury that can be fair right they don't have to be ignorant they just have to be fair so who they voted for whether they've ever heard of manna fort is sort of meaningless it's whether they can put aside any predispositions they may have and be fair remember this is the district in which the 9/11 case was tried and the Pentagon was just three miles from the federal courthouse in Alexandria and we were eight and I was the US attorney at the time we were able to find a jury that could be fair we weren't looking for people who never heard of 9/11 that would be crazy and so wouldn't you expect this to be a pretty crisp run trial yes well the federal courthouse in Alexandria is known as the rocket docket you know I mean they move right along they move with some dispatch Eugene and I've tried cases in front of Judge Ellis it's no-nonsense its next witness next witness you know 30 minute launch means a 30 minute lunch and I think folks should expect to see even though it's somewhat dry that it will move with dispatch Shannon as you cover the White House every day what's your sense of the level of concern in the Trump administration as it keeps an eye on the manna for trial I don't think the manna for trials gonna be that big of an issue for the president but stepping back here the president is the middle of a legal hurricane you have the manna for trial you have the Moller investigation you have his lawyer Michael Cohen now in public warfare with him don't forget stormy Daniels and a smaller case summers their votes this Apprentice contestant who is suing him this is a lot of legal battle friends this president is fighting and still with a relatively small bare-bones legal team so that is gonna be a major issue going forward John Heilemann final thought this morning as we wrap up I'm thinking that 30-minute lunch the checks talking about if they're not gonna work for you of me I don't think so yeah you don't stretch it out a little bit a court that moves with a little less than a batch so right stretch it out you're positioning for some of your legal troubles guys thank you all for being with Laurie on another busy
