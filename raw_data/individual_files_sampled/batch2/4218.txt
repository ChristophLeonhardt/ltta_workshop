and thanks to you at home for joining us this hour happy to have you with us all right playing the part of United States federal district court judge Tanya Tanya s Atkin playing that part will be me playing the part of Thomas and Saunders federal prosecutor in the National Security section of the DC US Attorney's Office that part will will be played also by me and playing the part of Robert Driscoll who represents accused Russian secret agent Maria boo Tina as her defense attorney that part will also be played by me and I know that sounds cheap it's a delicate balance here though I mean what we're saving on the salaries of actors with speaking roles we're making up for in terrible acting by me so what's going on here is that accused Russian secret agent Maria boo Tina has been in jail now for a week and a half she was arrested last weekend right before the Trump Putin summit in Helsinki she was actually arrested before the summit started even though we didn't find out about it at the time the court didn't unseal the case against her until a few hours after the summit was concluded now the coincided sub this two events is potentially interesting because she's accused of being an agent of the Russian Federation right secretly mounting an influence operation in this country on behalf of the Russian government to influence the Republican Party around the 2016 presidential election right since they unsealed her case right after the summit ended we have learned a lot of interesting stuff about what exactly the government is accusing her of and it's all fascinating right I think we are hardwired as humans to think that secret agent stuff is just inherently fascinating otherwise there wouldn't be you know books with shiny covers for sale and airport bookstores we love this stuff but in terms of the news in terms of the country in terms of this presidency in terms of the big scandal that has followed the president home from that summit with Putin in Helsinki last week there does remain one really big as yet unanswered question about the murray abou tina case does her case stand alone or does it link into the larger russia scandal the other prosecutions the the Russian government's effort to swing the election does it link in to the crucial question of whether the president and his campaign were somehow in on that Russian operation to influence the election so today court hearing for Murray abou Tina and I should tell you the bottom line here is that part of what came out in this court hearing today is that prosecutors say her case is connected to the larger story at least the evidence in her case is connected they say two other ongoing cases and investigations I should warn you in advance there's also a little argument about sex and her personal diary I swear it is relevant to the larger questions here but you should know what happens okay here goes so this is the initial discussion in court starts right away and it's about discovery it's about the evidence and materials the prosecution has seized in their case against Murray abou Tina and the this question is now being litigated in court as to whether and when and how her defense lawyer is going to be allowed to see all that stuff that the government has seized okay so here we go mr. Saunders the prosecutor good morning your honor thank you very much the judge good morning prosecutor we've had some preliminary discussions about discovery I think that where we are right now is that the government has substantial discovery that they're ready to turn over right away right now we already have about four to six terabytes of data the equivalent of over one and a half million files that we're ready to turn over just as fast as it can be loaded onto a portable hard drive there's another batch of data approximately four to six terabytes and then the judge jumps in let me stop you with regard to that first batch how long do you think that will take to transfer prosecutor well barring the issue of a protective order which I'll get to in a moment it shouldn't take more than a couple days the judge says all right okay prosecutors the second batch of data I think should be ready in maybe two weeks and again once it's ready it shouldn't take more than a couple of days to put it on a hard drive and providing to defense counsel the judge says okay prosecutor so the bottom line is the government wants to provide this to the defense right away immediately so that they can begin to prepare their defense in the courtroom the problem we're having is your honor agreeing on a protective order and a protective order from the government's position is essential not just for the normal reasons of protecting third parties personal identifying information but also to protect potential ongoing investigations and just given the sensitive nature of this case and in our discussions the question that seems to be overlying the conflict between the two parties to put it frankly is whether or not the defense counsel wants this information right away so he can prepare for a defense in this court or if defense counsel wants this information so that they can use it on cable news the reason I put it that way your honor is that we've proposed a basic protective order that says the information can be used for their defense in this case it gives the defense wide latitude to use it in this case including showing it to the appropriate witnesses showing it to those witnesses attorneys the defense rejected that offer and the defense's response is no we should have free reign to use that material however we want now our protective order says that you can use it for this case but you can't use it for other purposes including public disclosure like going on the press and the defense says no no no we should have free reign that's an exact quote from defense counsel now our concerns about protecting this information would be and then the judge jumps in other than the personal identifying information what are your other security concerns prosecutor our concerns are about protecting the integrity of potential ongoing investigations not just related to this case but potential other cases as well and the judge says all right potential other cases as well that might be affected by the disclosure of the evidence in the Morea butene a case so the prosecutors here are telling the judge it's bad that murid betina's defense lawyer has been going on dreaded cable news and talking about her case defending her in the court of public opinion and over the course of this hearing today they go on to fight with him about why that is bad in and of itself the judge at one point says to Marie abou Tina's defense lawyer do you think it's in your clients interest to have her case tried in the press she later tells boo Tina's defense lawyer bluntly quote I certainly don't want to have to impose a gag order as other judges have in other cases in this court but I will entertain a motion or a request to do so if I think that your statements cross the line and violate our local rules so I am cautioning you so there's this this fight in court today over the defense lawyer for Maria Bettina talking to the press about her case and the prosecution is pressing their argument and the judge seems to basically agree that patinas defense lawyer shouldn't be doing that the blood the judge bluntly Lauren warns her defense lawyer that that basically he should watch it in terms of him talking to the press she also later tells the defense counsel that there will be a protective order in this case at least for some material which means the judge said today in open court that she will set limits on what Betina can do and can't do with the evidence against her that the government has turned up once the government has to hand that over to them so they can prepare their defense so they have this fight today it definitely lands in a very one-sided way but for us watching this case and thinking about the national significance in this case and how this fits into the bigger existential scandal that looms over to this presidency right on the big question of does this dramatic case against this accused Russian agent play into the larger scandal involving Russia and the election and all the other other indictments that have come out I mean the the prosecutors today said yeah they said yeah this case is connected it's connected to other ongoing cases and other potential cases as well and they're saying that's related to why we need to stop her attorney from putting the evidence against her out in the press that stuff is sensitive it relates to ongoing cases and potentially other cases as well the judge goes with that here's the defense letter quote Your Honor the government's theory is that the documents and items that were possessed by my client before they were seized by the government somehow become confidential once they're seized by the government and when the government gives them back they can restrict their they can protect them under a protective order judge Thompson but Mr Driscoll if material that was seized that was in the possession of the defendant concerns material for example on her computer that the government is using in connection with an ongoing investigation well merely because it was in the possession of your client doesn't mean that it doesn't need to be kept confidential because there are ongoing investigations the fact that it was in your clients possession doesn't give it some kind of talismanic protection and so I'm not clearly understanding your position defense lawyer I mean it's my position that it's the government's burden to say what needs to be protected and why for example my clients diary my clients notes all those kinds of things are just simply documents of my client my clients immigration papers all those things simply because they come into the position simply because they came into the possession of the government she doesn't lose her First Amendment rights or her ability to do with those documents what she wants the judge well this is a pending criminal case I'm sort of curious as to what you would be planning to do with her immigration documents or her diary in advance of the trial defense lawyer well I mean they might be evidence at the trial but there might be other purposes for which they would be used there are ongoing congressional investigations for example that we've been dealing with a lot of these same documents have already been produced to the Senate Intelligence Committee judge well certainly if those documents are subjects of a subpoena you can go to the government and say that these documents are these items have been subject to subpoena so this is the judge whittling the defense lawyer down to a toothpick here right he's saying hey this was her stuff that the government seized we should be able to do whatever we want with it you can't stop us from giving it to the press the judge basically says seriously it's evidence in a criminal trial and if what was seized from her is relevant to other ongoing open investigations then of course you can't do anything you want with it and on that last point from the transcript there about how his client has already been questioned by other parts of the government where he raises congressional investigations and stuff that actually ends up being important - we'll come back to that in a second but there's just this one last thing you should see from the hearing today I mentioned that there was a discussion about sex related allegations this is that part it does not go well for the defense lawyer but remember where this came from last week the prosecutors laid out a case for the judge that Maria boo Tina shouldn't be released on bail they were arguing that she's a flight risk that she might basically go back to Russia they said there was no reason to expect that she'd feel bound to stay in the United States and face this trial and in order to make that case the prosecutors argued that what appeared to be her personal ties even her emotional ties to the United States they argued that those ties weren't real this is what they filed with the court last week under the headline boo Tina's quote tie to the United States is a duplicitous relationship this is prosecutors a few days ago quote during the course of this investigation the FBI has determined that Maria boo Tina gained access through u.s. person one to an extensive network of us persons in positions to influence political activities in the United States boo Tina age 29 and us person one age 56 are believed to have cohabitated and been involved in a personal relationship during the course of boo Tina's activities in the United States but this relationship does not represent a strong tie to the United States because Maria Bettina appears to treat it as simply a necessary aspect of her activities for example on at least one occasion boo Tina offered an individual other than us person one sex in exchange for a position within a special interest organization further in papers seized by the FBI Betina complained about living with us person 1 and expressed disdain for continuing to cohabitate with us person 1 so that was the prosecution last week they're saying listen she's a spy she's only involved with this guy because it's part of her cover as a spy today boo Tina's defense lawyer went off on that he and his client are absolutely not gonna stand for that from the prosecution he went after that them on this specific issue in court today and it it it didn't go well defense allure we did make a special request with the government to receive on an expedited basis any evidence they had to back up their claim that MS boo tina traded sex for a job that has become unfortunately a big issue in the media it was proffered you know as proffered in the bond hearing before we have no idea what the government's talking about we don't believe it's true and the government has we presume they could just give that part of it to us so we could see what it is and the government is not agreed to do that they said we can wait till discovery to do that and then the judge jumps in mr. Saunders she's speaking to the prosecutor now mr. Saunders prosecutor what's your position with regard to the information that mr. Driscoll just requested prosecutor our position is twofold one is we want to make sure the protective order is in place before giving over anything and second we're concerned about to what use anything will be put and if the defense is seeking particular pieces of evidence so they can take them to the news media we don't want that violation of the local rules the judge right I mean I think mr. Driscoll you're certainly entitled to discovery you're certainly entitled to know the basis of the charges against your client in accordance with our local rules but I'm not sure you're entitled to specific pieces of evidence to rebut media reports you know I'm sure it's not pleasant to read incorrect things about your client no lawyer likes that but my obligations here are to get this case resolved whether that be through trial or any other way in an expeditious and fair manner so to the extent that you'll get that information you'll get it as you would any other information in this trial so no I'm not helping you figure out why the government said that thing about your client and trading sex for a job the prosecution has said that part of Maria boo Tina's secret cover for her operation in this country on behalf of the Russian government is that she was supposedly romantically involved with this older man a Republican political activist in South Dakota now the government is making that public case because they say that relationship isn't an earnest relationship it wasn't real they're saying that was part of her cover story as a secret agent carrying out this influencer operation on behalf of the Russian government now whether or not it turns out to have been true left this ends up being sort of a key element in how the Maria butene s secret agent case relates to the rest rest of the Russia scandal and and potentially to the president's campaign I mean there's a few of these connections actually this is one of them one of the links that's already established is that prosecutors say Maria booty know was funded for this US operation by a Russian billionaire The Washington Post has since named that Russian billionaire they have also reported that that Russian billionaires son worked on the Trump campaign we have contacted the Trump campaign to ask them about whether that's true and if so what role was played on the campaign by the son of the man whose alleged to have funded this Russian influenced operation during the campaign so far we have not heard back from the campaign on that we will let you know when we do another potential link to the Trump campaign is through this guy us person one the the unnamed American citizen who Maria boo Tina was involved with in this potentially airs ATS personal relationship he lives in South Dakota and I am here to sing the praises of a local hero South Dakota journalist named Seth Tupper from the Rapid City Journal because mr. Tupper today tracked down a proposed order of cooperation between Maria boo Tina and federal prosecutors in South Dakota an offer that dates back to May of this year Maria boo Tina was apparently at least considering offering testimony or evidence to prosecutors to federal prosecutors for their investigation of her supposed boyfriend in South Dakota she was offering the US attorney in South Dakota she was considering an offer from the US attorney in South Dakota that she would cooperate with them in their investigation of her supposed boyfriend now depending on how things worked in that particular relationship that would seem to bolster the prosecution's case that maybe this wasn't true love right if she was talking to prosecutors about what evidence she might be give them against her guy well her guy this American man has not been charged with anything as far as we know but he is described in court filings it's basically a a co-conspirator helping her with her efforts to influence the Republican Party in large part through the NRA it is I just have to say just stepping back from this for a second it is remarkable that the NRA has had no comment on this case at all no comment on this indictment since it was first unsealed I mean this is federal prosecutors including veteran counterespionage prosecutors now saying in court and offering evidence in court that the NRA was used extensively by the Russian government in an illegal intelligence operation really no comment on that at all and all right none at all for more than a week now in January McClatchy reported that the FBI was investigating whether the Russian government funneled money through the NRA to help Trump win the election and that might have seemed nuts at the time when McClatchy published that report but you know what that was before we got this indictment about how else Russia was using the NRA to try to influence the election that was before boo Tina's defense lawyer said in court that Maria boo Tina was contacted by the FEC in March about quote whether or not certain donations had been made to political campaigns that was before the Washington Post reported today that Maria boo Tina testified to the Senate Intelligence Committee that one of her sources of funding in the United States in 2016 was a $5,000 a month consulting deal she had with the Outdoor Channel television network to provide advice on a planned program on hunting in Russia how did she get hooked up with the Outdoor Channel quote the Outdoor Channel's chief executive Jim Lipitor accompanied an NRA delegation that was hosted by Maria patina in Moscow in December 2015 and indeed red arrow there's the guy from the Outdoor Channel and a whole bunch of officials from the NRA in Moscow in December 2015 with accused Russian agent mariya boo Tina December 2015 that's exactly the same time that trump National Security Advisor Mike Flynn was also in Moscow sitting next to Vladimir Putin at a banquet dinner for Russian state TV it's the same time period December 2015 right before the Republican presidential primary started what was the NRA all doing in Moscow right before then what was Mike Flynn up doing in Moscow before then the Outdoor Channel would not confirm to the Washington Post today that they did have this accused Russian agent on their payroll for $5,000 a month in 2016 but we actually were able to reach them late in the day today and they did confirm to us that yes they did they had her on the payroll $5,000 a month now there's no reason to think that the Outdoor Channel knew at the time that the person they had put on their payroll was a secret agent who is now accused of running a Russian government influence operation to influence our election there's no indication that they knew that's what they were doing at the time but that is what they did and so last point here were these gun rights folks potentially a conduit for Russian money alongside other forms of Russian government influence on our 2016 campaign I mean McClatchy was on that story first honestly they took tons of heat for that story and they stood by it throughout but now I mean I don't think they take heat for that story today right now it is a much more open question it would be really really good to find that out the NRA according to federal prosecutors was a conduit for a secret Russian government influence operation designed to hit the campaign were they the conduit for another kind of influence from Russia to McClatchy reports that the FBI has been looking into Russian money flowing through the NRA to benefit Trump did that happen on the day we learned that Maria boo Tina was arrested on the day her arrest warrant the criminal complaint against her the FBI affidavit against her when the day that was all unsealed on the day of the trumpet and summit in Helsinki the Trump administration that day unveiled a new rule they announced they would be dropping the requirement which has existed for nearly 50 years in this country they would be dropping the requirement that organizations like the NRA have to disclose their major donors to the IRS on the day the Morea butene a case was unsealed they dropped that requirement seriously why that new rule and why that day hey there are sales from MSNBC thanks for watching MSNBC on youtube if you want to keep
