run bar Yoshi fought the deputy director of Israel's Colette Policy Forum which campaigns for Israel's future as the nation-state of the Jewish people and must have a bar gucci who is the general secretary of the palestinian national initiative party you're both welcome gentlemen Ron can we start with you and we've just been listening to some of the criticisms there from self-determination to downgrading the Arabic language the use of flags public holidays I suppose the point is how can non Jews in Israel feel anything other than marginalized by this law well this law actually doesn't change anything for the citizens of Israel it does not discriminate or take any rights from you and no does it give special rights to anyone the law simply says that Israel is the nation-state of the Jewish people it which is being long overdue the status of the Arabic language has not changed Arabic was an official language under the British Mandate not under the State of Israel so that is mainly declarative most countries in Europe have an official language what I find shocking is the fact that people are demanding for equality while they're holding another entity's flag in this case a terrorist flag must of fight just dealing with some of what Ron was speaking it but there is this over-the-top reaction to what we're seeing I suppose in another way does the law really have any practical implications after all Israel's Declaration of Independence insists on equality and rights for all inhabitants irrespective of religion or race well I am really shocked that your guest calls the Palestinian flag a terrorist flag I mean the Palestinian state is recognized by 134 countries of the world and Israel concluded an agreement with the PLO which has this flag so I don't know why he's using this language which is very dangerous but more than that he is right he is right and saying that did not change much because actually Israel has been a racist country a nationalistic chauvinistic state that is practicing apartheid in the worst form of apartheid much worse than what South African apartheid system wants this law is not anything but this law is a basic law and that means it's constitutional which means it makes Israel officially a chauvinist apartheid racist State for Jewish people only it does not identify the borders of Israel which means that this system of discrimination includes not only Palestinians inside Israel but also Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza Strip which are occupied since 51 years also it includes Syrian people who are living in the Golan Heights it also includes the Druze community which is part of the Palestinian population that has been cooperating with this Israeli regime and now it is discriminated against this is not nothing but a serious violation of all basic human rights it's a very serious violation of the claim that Israel is a democracy this is a confirmation that Israel is a chauvinist country it's an apartheid system and what they have done is very dangerous just just one point it says now today there are six million Palestinians and six million Jewish people living on the land of historic Palestine this law says that this land is only for half of the population and the other half would be discriminated against run we will let you maybe respond to some of those accusations in a moment but I just want to also get your take and what Benjamin Netanyahu said he said that without the law quote it will be impossible to ensure for generations the future of Israel as a Jewish national state what does that actually mean because by any measure the Israeli government has the upper hand by some distance doesn't it well I think that what you just heard is the exact example why we need it you have a person who's not an Israeli citizen it is bashing my country in Israel all citizens are equal under the law the third biggest party in the parliament is the air party and Arab Supreme Court judge send my Jewish president to jail now in Judea Samaria which sometimes people mistakenly called the West Bank it's a hidden Ryan it's a Jew Free State I has a dream not allowed to be there it's amazing that someone that their their government pays four hundred million dollars per year for terrorists is saying that Israel is an apartheid state in Israel every citizen has full equal rights we are saying that it's the nation-state not most countries in Europe most countries that are members in the United Nations are member states it means that you are sorry our nation safe it means that you have an official language in an official flag and an anthem in most countries have new symbols including countries who are members of the EU when I find shocking is that people who condemn the bare existence of the State of Israel in any border are saying that we are in apartheid state which i think is just appalled we have to understand this law does nothing about Judea and Samaria unfortunately if it were up to me we would implement Israeli law over Judea Samaria they just doesn't touch it that's not true I guess for people who say that have not read the bill it's actually a very short bill it's only 11 short clauses okay Israel is the most vibrant democracy in the villages I just want to finish it 6 most vibrant democracy in the Middle East under the PA what what my my colleague here is saying basically the country in the world has it and I do and I do hope that we will stop the occupation the illegal occupation and I do you are occupied okey but there is never stable there's never said called Palestine this is again you are to be worried but people you know after Twitter by international law I'm not occupying authorities verify what's your currency who was the Prime Minister what was it should be and there's also historical facts excuse me do you agree that we should have a ballot or not now I definitely not but I think when we have a musing is that you want another state but you also I why not right why not Israel and what I was saying yes exactly if you but within Israel off you say welcome back to must defer Arabs and Jews as we've seen marched together on Saturday they've marched together before but there are those even in minorities in Israel who have publicly stated I'm just looking at a piece an opinion piece of the minute if Israel's position as a Jewish state is eroded people living in the country would no longer get to enjoy the freedoms and security that Israel currently provides the people who might not necessarily receive those protections in for instance nearby muslim-majority nations you're saying that listen we have to see it to know the history properly there was a Palestine in which Palestinians and Jewish people lived together in one state and as Jewish people were very small minority then there were immigrations and Israel was established after displacing no less than 750,000 Palestinians which were 70 percent of the population who became refugees today that they are denying the right of to come back to their homelands Palestinians and Israel is reached a compromise in 1993 which is called two-state solution according to which there should be a state palestinian independent state and West Bank and Gaza including East Jerusalem and Israel would exist as a country now Israeli saying no you can't have two-state solution we and he they are even saying we don't have a right to a homeland of our own and at the same time they say this this land is Jewish only so practically they are jackin us to a system of apartheid he says I am a person who was born in Jerusalem I worked as a medical doctor in Jerusalem for 15 years and now Israel prohibits me from entering this Jerusalem which is considering when they consider it a state of capital of the State of Israel denying me the right to be in the city where I was born so what is that if it is not a system of apartheid the most important core are here which mature guests should understand if they kill two-state solution the only solution will be one state one democratic state with total equal rights and we will have the same rights to Jaffa Erica Negev every other place in Israel as it is part of historic Palestine and if they won't be in jacket it's as simple as that run just Park on this law the government has been working on the bill and now law for seven years is that not an indication of the the depth of feeling from it looks across the board that the law is in century to his release from what we're seeing here all walks of life oh no the exact opposite because Israel doesn't have a written constitution our Constitution is written chapter by chapter why should I let you speak when you said complete nonsense with no historical facts so please let me finish state run go ahead can you tell me the currency of the Palestine can you tell me one mare that lived in Palestine you're a fake people that were created in 1964 when Israel had no control of Judea Samaria and Jordan it was in charge of that area and the whole goal of the PLO will have a Palestinian state Israel allows to have a person instead will have one state solution if you want everyone having quality equality and for democracy and for liberation are you talking about right that he feels ashamed I can he said that he is ashamed of being an Israeli after this law was passed you have to listen all these I wish is very strong I want Israel to 32 death sentence if you sell your house to a Jew the Palestinian Authority pays 400 million dollars per year to terrorists let's can we get back to the topic instead oh come on are you Israel according to opinion why Israel is the only country in the water not identified it has nothing why the bill but to answer your question I hope I hope that the implemented yes yes here both of you okay most of I want to put the point to you that if Arab MPs in the Knesset describe the law as apartheid and racist and you've just said the same words do you think that that is going to make conservative or right-of-center people in Israel come more around to your way of thinking or simply put them further apart by using such language is it helping the case in any way Mustapha it does help because let me tell you a very well-known very well-known Israeli musician Daniel Barenboim was respected all over the world for a long time his it to use the word apartheid after this law he wrote an article in which he said he is ashamed of being an Israeli and he said this is a system of apartheid many Jewish people demonstrated with us against this law because it is contradictive to the future of both Palestinians and Israelis and as I said if he wants to annex us and prevent us from having our own state we will be six million people in the land of historic Palestine we will have a majority in any democratic would that means he has to accept me as the prime minister of that country if I win the elections will he accept that no they say we will annex your land we will keep your occupation we will keep the system of apartheid and we do not have equal rights to the Jewish Israelis okay this is apartheid I cannot find a different word to describe it as President Carter did describe it before he said this is apartheid rands not my opinion this is let me also put the point you you can also respond to what's just been said there I want to just get your thoughts there because it hasn't really been clear on what do you say - num juris release who believe that they're now lesser citizens in the eyes of the law how do you respond to their fears and concerns with today's development it's simply not true and I'll say it again the law does not take any rights of any group of people regardless of any any topic the thing is this one cannot say I want equal rights in a country didn't I'm not a member of another citizen of so we have an Arab living in Ramallah nor does he want to mean he's saying I don't have the same earth I let you say all of your nonsense sorry Yui doc you paying what am I paying you because you're not there was never a state called Palestine but we can go back to the bill the bill is not implemented over Judea and Samaria in fact the whole conservation but Deuteronomy is yes anything to do with the two-state solution has nothing to do with it actually the only reason why the PA is still in control is because sometimes the Israeli army is helping the Palestinian Authority otherwise Hamas will butcher them like the in Gaza Israel in Judea and Samaria no could you please let me finish my sentence I let you say all of your nonsense again and again which you mentioned apartheid this it's a brand new shoes are not allowed to dove and it's the only place where you don't you have to will ever you have I'm sorry a nice can I have you can I enjoy each spoke you said enough son you said enough nonsense please let me finish two sentences number one under hundred Israeli yeah you're saying what a nonsense under the Israeli law all citizens are equal under the law in June this is doesn't matter people who are not Israeli citizens nor did they wanna be don't have Israeli rights because they're not citizens but these are two complete different topics one is about the nation state bill I'm not occupying you you are not relent do you want I wouldn't mind implemented an you said what I said before I don't mind implementing the Israeli law over Judea and Samaria and giving you full equal rights but you keep ignoring it the thing is where you don't have Israel's sovereignty you in Gaza which is controlled under Hamas can you please stop interrupting me this is the this is what will happen if we're just running mobs here on sentence right right go ahead beat be brief because I want to bring in a piece to most of it most of it just let run finish thank you please give me a chance once and it's in Israel the fact that we have different the fact that we have different people saying different voices in Israel it's because we're democracy you're unable to say different voices to express these different voices and different opinions under the Palestinian 30 or under Hamas the fact that there's such a protest in Israel just shows how much of a strong democracy we are we're able to to absorb all of these non like we just heard in this in this debate thank you okay mr. part what happens now do you expect repercussions doesn't expect as a result of this law and would you would you say categorically that no violence should be carried out in its name I am totally against violence I am an advocate of non-violence actually I'm an advocate of popular nonviolent resistance which is successful and which most part is now adopt but what I am saying here is that this guy is telling me I can't have citizenship but he wants to continue to occupy me and occupy my land and he says I cannot have steps just like in the air you can react is that it is a democracy this is not a democracy a democracy does not mean that you have the right today's a democracy your democracy is me and you cannot have the right to suppress me and do not have the right to prevent me from having equal rights and this law is very dangerous for the future of both Palestinians and Israelis because it means this conflict would be protracted instead of a solution instead of a two-state solution you are advocating no solution you are advocating the continuation of occupation and the consolidation of a system of your pain we are it's been a very spirited discussion since we appreciate both your thoughts Israel and mr. we have to finish it there we've been speaking to run bar Yasha fat from the KOA LED Policy Forum on Mustafa Barghouti leader of the Palestinian national initiative party thank you both you
