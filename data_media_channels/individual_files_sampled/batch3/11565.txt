lengthy litigation and a seemingly unilateral decision by the US Justice Department saw blueprints for 3d printable guns made briefly available on the web and in the short time they were online it's thought the files were downloaded thousands of times on Wednesday a texas-based a gun rights grip published blueprints for 3d printable guns openly online but eight states went to court on a seattle judge then ordered the plans be taken down the battle is not over though with the man behind the blueprints comparing his mission to anti-establishment activism like WikiLeaks you could cause digital radicals we believe that the internet will perfectly preserve the Second Amendment and help to be its expansion what is WikiLeaks for guns this was our idea our kind of seed you know like our immediate purpose like wow could we be WikiLeaks for guns what would that look like we found a 3d printer we said what if you could 3d print a gun and then share the file on the Internet that would be like WikiLeaks Cody Wilson who you just saw there started his quest back in 2013 when he first developed a weapon that could be printed at home until recently the federal government especially the State Department made sure those blueprints did not make it onto the web but earlier this year the Justice Department decided to drop litigation against 3d gun plans from being posted online putting it at odds with the State Department the reason that the State Department got involved are only equity in this is because of our role in controlling foreign access to US defense technology in simpler words the State Department wants to prevent the wrong people from acquiring weapons overseas so there's an extraordinary story so we need an extrordinary man to put some meat on the bones of it and we have got one legal analyst and commentator Lionel welcome back Lionel does it surprise you that these two key departments of government aren't even on the same page and such well let's call it as it is an emotive issue guns for the American people has that happened before even happens all the time and Noah does not surprise me and what will perhaps surprise you or shouldn't is that there has always been provision on the internet for blueprints to make plastic guns via 3d printing let me repeat it's always been there it's nothing new so what do you ask is the source of this brouhaha next Trump is doing nothing new it's already been there there was also a First Amendment right to the dissemination of information now the only thing which is on the books today ours and I don't want to go with two too much but as a lawyer I can tell you as a former prosecutor it gets a little sticky when we talk about that which is sent overseas which really doesn't apply here and also it deals with there is a law that prohibits undetectable guns that cannot be picked up through conventional say Airport types of of detection devices that being said gunsmithing there is a right that I have to make a gun now weather-wise sell it distributed that's a different story that's not in here let me give you another a little bit of a reference in 1971 in this country there was a famous Anarchist Cookbook the Anarchist Cookbook told people how to make potions and how to poisons how to kill people and it was information that was gleaned and collated from army manuals information that was already made available the issue that our courts have dealt with is if I provide information to you or data or a thought or a passage or a song or instructions the same thing with weaves to have rules or instructions on how to make a nuclear bomb you find the fissile material great and if you think you're gonna go home and plug one of these things to your HP 3d computer or that al-qaeda is gonna mass-produce plastic guns I mean this does it none of this makes any sense but sense has something to do with it it's all as you say emotive and emotion let me just pick up on something he said there Donald Trump's spokesperson said on Wednesday that the Justice Department went ahead without the president's approval how can something like this get past his desk without meeting signing off we have right now a Department of Justice and its subsidiary the FBI that is acting completely independent of the President and is in a parallel universe there is there are what is referred to often times some may see too much is this thing called the deep state I'm not suggesting that's here but this dissociation this the schizoid connection between the president and the Department of Justice is is typical but what this is is if you read the Attorney General for Massachusetts who you would think would know about the law it seems that right now the message of this is that Donald Trump because of this this crazed Donald Trump that we're gonna have plastic guns that nobody knows anything about what is a gun the federal definition of what a gun is the laws that are already here this is complete hysteria not based in fact or reality just briefly putting your legal hat on again line know that these blueprints have been on the web albeit briefly in reality they're out there aren't they so isn't the protect protracted court battle a waste of time absolutely it's moot let me also repeat they've been on there I implore anybody go online in Google how the the blueprints for a plastic gun and also remember you can say go online and say all right I don't want a gun which is defined as something which is cabled to capable of expelling a projectile through an explosive that's all a gun is under federal law but I can go and say let me make a facsimile no harmless plastic gun and then the second blueprint is how do I convert that that's there as well I have been able to before the Republic this Grand Republic we have been making guns weapons it is protected speech and moreover extracting it the mere information that data not the dissemination of the gun think about this the implications of free speech it's not the gun that I'm providing it's the information how does one do it if I write a book about how people fashion knives in prisons a real-life Shawshank Redemption emphasis on the word shank am i telling people how to do this Lionel legal analyst on political commentator we always appreciate your time thank you you
