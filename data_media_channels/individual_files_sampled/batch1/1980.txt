we knew that we wanted to be with each other for the rest of our lives and we knew that there was no reason to wait so we decided if we are married then they can't separate us I've been jobless for one year and a half just because I'm sayin I've been like I'm here legally I'm not a refugee I have like I should have all the foreigners rights but I really don't really and I don't have the refugees right because I'm not a refugee so it's like really hard and now we I mean when the band came it really just it was a big disappointment because for so long we thought we can escape this you know it's gonna go away like there's all these legal challenges to it and I was it was giving me a lot of hope but then when the Supreme Court made their decision to support it I was I mean I could I could cry like it it really made me have a loss of faith and hope in our legal system there is no reason for them to ban me or to deny me or to eject me and last day when I look that I am a Syrian Muslim guy there's no other way at the end of the day we have a home there we have a family there and yes it's in war and yes the economy there is is not in a good position but what's more important in this world than being around people you love
