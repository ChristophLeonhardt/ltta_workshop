TO SAY TIME FOR TONIGHT'S EXTREMELY IMPORTANT IG REPORT OPENING MONOLOGUE. â™ª Sean: I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT BEFORE WE GET INTO THE CONTENTS OF THIS REPORT THAT WE'RE ALL GOING TO BREAK DOWN NUT COURSE OF THIS HOUR. IT'S VERY IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTAND SOMETHING. THIS IS SADLY A SWAMP DOCUMENT. NOW, THE SWAMP ALWAYS PROTECTS THE SWAMP. UNFORTUNATELY AND IN REALITY, BEFORE WE EVEN GET STARTED, LET ME JUST REMIND YOU OF SOMETHING I SAID LAST NIGHT. THE FACTS IN THIS CASE ARE NOT IN DISPUTE. THE EVIDENCE IS OVERWHELMING AND CONVERTIBLE. HILLARY VIOLATED THE ESPIONAGE ACT. THAT'S A FACT. SHE MISHANDLED. SHE DESTROYED CLASSIFIED-TOP SECRET SPECIAL ACCESS PROGRAMMING INFORMATION. IT'S A FACT. SHE DELETE YOU HAD 33,000 SUBPOENAED EMAILS. SHE ACID WASHED HER HARD DRIVE WITH BLEACH BIT SO THEY COULDN'T GET FACTS. SHE HAD AIDES DESTROY HER MOBILE DEVICES WITH HAMMERS ALSO A FACT. HERE IS ANOTHER FACT CHRISTIAN KRRISTIAN KRISSTIAN KRISTIIAN KRISTIANN KRISTIAN SAUCIER SPENT A YEAR IN PRISON FOR, WHAT, SIX PICTURES ON A CELL PHONE AT A SUBMARINE THAT HE WAS PROUD HE WORKED ON. HE NEVER SHARED IT WITH ANYBODY. SO, IN TERMS OF SEVERITY, IT DOESN'T COMPARE TO WHAT WE KNOW HILLARY CLINTON DID. WE ALSO KNOW THAT COMEY AND TRUMP HATER PETER STRZOK STARTED WRITING HER EXONERATION IN EARLY MAY OF 2016. THAT'S A FACT. THEY WILL DIDN'T INTERVIEW HER UNTIL JULY 2ND 2016 AND THEN JULY 5TH THEY EXONERATED HER WE KNOW THEY PULLED THE LEGAL DEFINITION OF GROSS NEGLIGENCE, THEY PULLED IT RIGHT OUT OF DOCUMENT. THEY PULLED OUT IN ONE OF THEIR EARLIER WRITINGS IN THIS THAT, IN FACT, FOREIGN INTELLIGENCE SERVICES HAD HACKED INTO THAT BATHROOM CLOSET. ALL A FACT. EVERY SINGLE AMERICAN TONIGHT YOU SHOULD BE SHOCKED, YOU SHOULD BE DISAPPOINTED, YOU SHOULD BE CONCERNED ABOUT WHAT WE'RE LEARNING. WE'RE TALKING ABOUT ABUSE OF POWER AND CORRUPTION AT THE HIGHEST LEVELS OF THE FBI. AND HOW THE FBI WAS POLITICIZED. IT'S ALL TRUE AND WE HAVE A LOT OF NEW EVIDENCE WE'LL SHARE WITH YOU TONIGHT. I WANT TO BE VERY CLEAR AT THE START. I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT RANK AND FILE FBI GUYS. I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT THEM. I PREDICT BY THE TIME THIS STORY ENDS, THEY WILL END UP BEING THE HEROES WHEN THEY'RE FINALLY SUBPOENAED AND ALLOWED TO TESTIFY AND TELL THEIR STORIES ABOUT WHAT THEY SAW THEIR BOSSES WERE DOING. AND TONIGHT WE'LL HIGHLIGHT THE STARK DIFFERENCE BETWEEN TWO INVESTIGATIONS. YOU GET THE WHITE GLOVE SPECIAL TREATMENT FOR HILLARY CLINTON AND THEN THE HEAVY HANDED TACTICS ALL IN AGAINST DONALD TRUMP. IT SHOULD SHOCK YOU. IF YOU BELIEVE IN EQUAL JUSTICE UNDER THE LAW. EQUAL APPLICATION OF OUR LAWS AND OUR CONSTITUTION. NOW, WITH HILLARY CLINTON, EVERYONE WAS GIVEN IMMUNITY. WITH DONALD TRUMP, IT'S SEARCH WARRANTS, SUBPOENAS, BREAKING DOWN DOORS AT 6:00 A.M., GUNS ABLAZED. THE HATRED OF DONALD TRUMP FROM THE LEFT IN THE MEDIA IN THIS COUNTRY KNOWS NO BOUNDS. THERE REALLY WAS A SCHEME TO PROTECT HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON FROM BEING INDICTED AND SMEAR AND SLANDER THEN CANDIDATE, THEN PRESIDENT-ELECT DONALD TRUMP AND NOW PRESIDENT AT ALL COSTS. NOW THE CONTEMPT FOR YOU, THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. THE THING THAT SOME OF THESE PEOPLE SAID ABOUT US, YOU, THE AMERICAN PEOPLE IS REPUGNANT, IT'S APPALLING. IT SHOULDN'T HAPPEN IN THIS COUNTRY. NOW, TO THE REPORT. AS I JUST SAID, IT'S AS I JUST SAID, ITSS AS I JUST SAID, ITS FINDINGS CONFIRM PRETTY MUCH EVERYTHING WE HAVE BEEN TELLING YOU HERE ON HANNITY FOR MONTHS AND THAT MANY IN THE MEDIA HAVE IGNORED. WE HAVE TREY GOWDY SUMMED IT UP VERY WELL. HE SAID, QUOTE: I AM ALARMED, ANGERED AND DEEPLY DISAPPOINTED BY THE INSPECTOR GENERAL'S FINDINGS OF NUMEROUS FAILURES BY THE DUONG AND FBI IN INVESTIGATING POTENTIAL ESPIONAGE ACT VIOLATIONS BY THE FORMER SECRETARY OF STATE HILLARY CLINTON. WITHOUT FURTHER DISCUSSION, HERE'S WHAT GOWDY IS TALKING ABOUT. FIRST AND FOREMOST, WE START WITH DISGRACED FORMER FBI DIRECTOR JAMES COMEY. NOW, PRESIDENT TRUMP FIRED COMEY FOR MISHANDLING THE CLINTON SERVER INVESTIGATION AMONG OTHER REASONS. HE WILL DESERVED TO BE FIRED. TONIGHT, THE PRESIDENT IS VINDICATED. THE INSPECTOR GENERAL FINDS IN THIS REPORT JAMES COMEY'S ACTIONS WERE BOTH EXTRAORDINARY AND INSUBORDINATE. HIS INVESTIGATION INTO HILLARY CLINTON DEVIATED FROM WELL-ESTABLISHED DEPARTMENT POLICIES. NOW, THIS INCLUDES COMEY AND OTHER FBI AGENTS ALLOWING CLINTON AIDE AND WITNESSES TO THE INVESTIGATION, CHERYL MILLS, TO ACTUALLY SIT IN DURING HILLARY CLINTON'S FBI INTERVIEW. AN INTERVIEW THAT TOOK PLACE AFTER COMEY HAD ALREADY DRAFTED A LETTER EXONERATING HILLARY OF ALL CHARGES. AND THERE'S MORE. THE REPORT ALSO FINDS THAT WHILE INVESTIGATING HILLARY CLINTON FOR CONDUCTING OFFICIAL GOVERNMENT BUSINESS, WITH A PRIVATE EMAIL ACCOUNT, WHOA, JAMES COMEY WAS ALSO USING A PRIVATE EMAIL ACCOUNT TO CONDUCT OFFICIAL GOVERNMENT BUSINESS. AND BY THE WAY COMEY RESPONDED ON TWITTER WRITING, QUOTE: I RESPECT THE DOJ IG OFFICE. WHICH IS WHY I URGED THEM TO DO THIS REVIEW. THE CONCLUSIONS ARE REASONABLE, EVEN THOUGH I DISAGREE WITH SOME. PEOPLE OF GOOD FAITH CAN SEE AN UNPRECEDENTED DECISION. I PRAY NO DIRECTOR FACES IT AGAIN. THANKS TO IG'S PEOPLE FOR HARD WORK. LET'S BREAK THIS DOWN. JAMES COMEY, THE FBI DIRECTOR WENT ROGUE. THERE IS NO OTHER CONCLUSION. HE BROKE LONG STANDING DEPARTMENT POLICY LITERALLY WRITING THE EXONERATION OF HILLARY CLINTON BEFORE EVER INTERVIEWING HER OR 17 OTHER KEYENS WITHS. CLOSED UP THE INVESTIGATION. AND IMMEDIATELY THE SAME PEOPLE THIS HATED TRUMP THAT WE NOW KNOW AND WE'LL PROVE IT IN MORE DETAIL, THE SAME PEOPLE LITTLELY BEGIN THE EXONERATION OF DONALD TRUMP. THEY EXONERATED HER BACK IN MAY. INTERVIEW HER JULY 2ND, JULY 5TH SHE IS EXONERATED. SAME PEOPLE THAT COMMITTED THE SAME MISDEEDS AS CLINTON THEY WERE INVESTIGATED AND PUT IN JAIL. THAT'S WHY COMEY WAS FIRED AROUND SHOULD BE INVESTIGATED FURTHER. THAT'S NOT ALL. NOW WE HAVE EVEN MORE EVIDENCE TO SHOW HOW FBI AGENTS MISHANDLED THE CLINTON INVESTIGATION. LET'S GO BACK TO THE IG REPORT. AGENTS INVOLVED IN THE CLINTON FOUNDATION INVESTIGATION, GET THIS: THEY WERE INSTRUCTED TO TAKE NO OVERT INVESTIGATIVE STEPS PRIOR TO THE ELECTION. AND THE REPORT ALSO CONFIRMED THAT WHILE THE FBI WAS TIPTOEING AROUND THEIR FAVORITE CANDIDATE, HILLARY CLINTON, WHO THEY FULLY THOUGHT WOULD WIN THE ELECTION, CLINTON'S PRIVATE SERVER WAS BEING ACCESSED BY FOREIGN ACTORS. OH, THAT'S SOMETHING ELSE THAT THEY TOOK OUT. AND, REMEMBER THE FBI TRUMP HATING LOVE BIRDS STRZOK AND PAGE. THEY ARE BACK AND BACK IN A BIG WAY TONIGHT. HEAVILY FEATURED IN HOROWITZ'S REPORT HOROWITZ UNBELIEVABLY, THIS IS OUTRAGEOUS DID, NOT FIND THAT BIAS IMPACTED THE FBI INVESTIGATION U LOOK AT THIS UNCOVERED TEXT MESSAGE. THE DATE, AUGUST 8TH, 2016, PAGE IT CLAIMS TRUMP IS NEVER GOING TO BECOME PRESIDENT, RIGHT? RIGHT? AND STRZOK RESPONDS, QUOTE: NO. NO, HE'S NOT. WE'LL STOP IT. IN CASE YOU ARE WONDERING WHAT STRZOK IS TALKING ABOUT. HE'S MAKING IT CRYSTAL CLEAR IN THIS TWEET FROM A MONTH EARLIER IN JULY OF 2016. DAMN, THIS FEELS MOMENTOUS BECAUSE THIS MATTERS. THE OTHER ONE DID, TOO. MEANING THE INVESTIGATION INTO CLINTON. BUT THAT WAS TO ENSURE WE DIDN'T BLEEP SOMETHING UP. THIS MATTERS BECAUSE THIS MATTERS. SO SUPER GLAD TO BE ON THIS VOYAGE WITH YOU. AND OF COURSE STRZOK IS TALKING ABOUT THE IMPENDING RUSSIA INVESTIGATION INTO THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN AND COMPARING IT TO THE CLINTON INVESTIGATION WHICH HE TRIED SO HARD NOT TO SCREW UP BECAUSE IT WAS HIS EFFORT TO CLEAR HILLARY CLINTON OF ALL CHARGES SO SHE COULD REMAIN A CANDIDATE. THE FAVORED CANDIDATE. DON'T FORGET ABOUT THE INSURANCE POLICY THAT WAS WITH RETH REFERENCED IN PREVIOUS PAGE STRZOK TEXTS IF IN FACT TRUMP WON THE ELECTION. IT'S ALSO IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER THAT ALL OF THIS TOOK PLACE AROUND EXTREME LEVELS OF APPEAR AT THIS TRUMP BIAS AT THE HIGHEST LEVELS OF FBI. SOME OF IT SHOULD SHOCK THE CONSCIENCE. PAGE CALLING TRUMP ENORMOUS D BAG AND ADD THAT THE TO LIST OF INSULTS BOTH PAGE AND STRZOK WERE LOBBYING AGAINST DONALD TRUMP CALLING HIM AN IDIOT. A MENACE, A LOATHE SOME HUMAN BEING AND SO MUCH MORE. STRZOK IS THE GUY LEADING ALL OF THIS INVESTIGATION. THEN THE REPORT CONCLUDED ABOUT THESE TEXTS, QUOTE: NOT ONLY INDICATIVE OF A BIASED STATE OF MIND, BUT EVEN MORE SERIOUSLY IMPLIES A WILLINGNESS TO TAKE OFFICIAL ACTION TO IMPACTED THE PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE'S ELECTORAL PROSPECTS. YEAH, THAT'S POLITICAL. LISA PAGE BY THE WAY CALLED TRUMP AS WE SAID BEFORE, WE WON'T GO BACK TO THAT AND THEN THE IG FOUND EVIDENCE OF SO MUCH MORE BIAS AMONG FBI OFFICIALS, FOR EXAMPLE, LOOK AT THIS MESSAGE FROM ONE UNNAMED AGENT, QUOTE: TRUMP SUPPORTERS BY THE WAY THAT'S YOU. ARE ALL POOR TO MIDDLE CLASS, UNEDUCATED, LAZY, POSS, WE KNOW WHAT THAT IS THAT THINK HE WILL MAGICALLY GRANT THEM JOBS FOR DOING NOTHING. ON OCTOBER 28TH, 2016, SHORTLY AFTER COMEY'S LETTER TO CONGRESS, THAT ANNOUNCED THE REOPENING OF THE CLINTON INVESTIGATION, ONE UNNAMED FBI ATTORNEY SENT AN INSTANT MESSAGE TO A FELLOW FBI EMPLOYEE, LOOK AT THIS. I'M CLINGING TO SMALL POCKETS OF HAPPINESS IN THE DARK TIMES OF THE REPUBLICAN'S DESTRUCTION. AND FOLLOWING THE ELECTION, THE SAME FBI ATTORNEY SENT AN INSTANT MESSAGE THAT SAID, QUOTE: I'M NUMB WITH A FELLOW EMPLOYEE RESPONDING I CAN'T STOP CRYING. NOW, PRIMARY TO THE ELECTION IN SEPTEMBER OF 2016, ONE FBI AGENT INVOLVED IN AN INSTANT MESSAGE CONVERSATION WHERE THEY ATTACKED PRESIDENT TRUMP'S SUPPORTERS, THEIR WORDS, NOT MINE, I DON'T USE IT RETARDED. AND BY THE WAY THAT'S ONLY THE TIP OF THE ICEBERG. IG IS REFERRED FIVE FBI EMPLOYEES FOR INVESTIGATION AFTER UNCOVERING THEIR EXTREME POLITICAL BIAS AND GET THIS: HOROWITZ'S OVERALL CONCLUSION SAID NO PREVAILING BIAS AT THE FBI AND ITS ACTIONS IN THE CLINTON AND TRUMP INVESTIGATIONS REALLY, MR. HOROWITZ? YOU DON'T SEE THAT AS POLITICAL BIAS? WHAT DO YOU CALL EVERYTHING YOU JUST ROUTERRED? IT'S ALL POLITICAL AND LOOK AT THIS IN THE IG REPORT ALSO FOUND THAT FBI EMPLOYEES RECEIVED OH, FREE TICKETS TO SPORTING EVENTS FROM WHO? THE DESTROY TRUMP MEDIA. SO-CALLED JOURNALISTS THEY WENT ON GULF OUTINGS WITH MEDIA REFS. THEY WERE TREATED TO DRINKS AND FOOD BY REPORTERS. BECAUSE OF EVERYTHING WE JUST SHOWED YOU, THAT REPORT CONCLUDED THE COMEY, PAGE, STRZOK AND OTHERS SEVERELY DAMAGED THE REPUTATION OF THE FBI. HERE IS WHAT CURRENT FBI DIRECTOR CHRISTOPHER WRAY SAID ABOUT ALL OF THESE DAMNING FINDINGS, TAKE A LOOK. I TAKE THIS REPORT VERY SERIOUSLY AND WE ACCEPT ITS FINDINGS AND RECOMMENDATIONS. IT'S ALSO IMPORTANT THOUGH TO NOTE WHAT THE INSPECTOR GENERAL DID NOT FIND. THIS REPORT DID NOT FIND ANY EVIDENCE OF POLITICAL BIAS OR IMPROPER CONSIDERATIONS ACTUALLY IMPACTING THE INVESTIGATION UNDER REVIEW THE REPORT DOES IDENTIFY ERRORS OF JUDGMENT, VIOLATIONS OF OR EVEN DISREGARD FOR POLICY AND DECISIONS THAT AT THE VERY LEAST WITH THE BENEFIT OF HINDSIGHT WERE NOT THE BEST CHOICES. WE HAVE ALREADY START STARTED TAKING STEPS TO DIRECT THOSE ISSUES. DIRECTOR WRAY READ THE DOCUMENT. THERE IS POLITICS ALL OVER THAT DOCUMENT AND FOR YOU TO SAY OTHERWISE IS NOT FAIR TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE NOR IS IT FAIR TO ALL THE GOOD, HONEST HARD WORKING FBI INDIVIDUALS RANK AND FILE THAT PROTECT US EVERY DAY THAT YOU DID RIGHTLY TALK ABOUT TODAY. A GOOD START, ALL RIGHT, DIRECTOR WRAY. WELL THAT WOULD BE FIRING PETER STRZOK. DOES HE STILL HAVE A JOB DESPITE EVERYTHING YOU JUST SAW? PETER STRZOK REMAINS ON THE PAYROLL OF THE FEDERAL BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION? ARE YOU KIDDING ME? AND MEANWHILE THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION WAS ALSO FEATURED IN THE REPORT. FOOTNOTE PAGE 89 READS, QUOTE: PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA WAS ONE OF 13 INDIVIDUALS WITH WHOM CLINTON HAD DIRECT CONTACT USING HER CLINTON MAIL.COM ACCOUNT. THAT INFORMATION BREAKS WITH OBAMA'S INITIAL CLAIMS THAT HE LEARNED OF CLINTON'S PRIVATE EMAIL FROM THE MEDIA REPORTS. WHAT WERE THEY PROTECTING? REMEMBER THEY CHANGED THAT TO SAY HIGH RANKING OFFICIAL AND THE ATTORNEY GENERAL AT THIS TIME LORETTA LYNCH WAS ALSO TAKING TO TASK IN THE REPORT FOR INFAMOUS TARMAC MEETING WITH BILL CLINTON JUST BEFORE THEY CAME TO A DECISION IN JUNE OF 2016. THE REPORT STATES, QUOTE: LYNCH'S FAILURE TO RECOGNIZE THE APPEARANCE PROBLEM CREATED BY FORMER PRESIDENT CLINTON'S VISIT AND ERROR IN JUDGMENT. OKAY, 45 MINUTES TALKING ABOUT GRANDCHILDREN, I WILL BUY THAT FIRST, HERE IS HOW CHAIRMAN GOWDY AND GOODLATTE RESPONDED TO THIS ENTIRE REPORT EARLIER TODAY. TAKE A LOOK. WHAT A DARK DAY IT IS FORTH FBI AND DOJ, TWO INSTITUTIONS OUR COUNTRY DESPERATELY NEEDS. WE DESPERATELY HAVE TO BE ABLE TO HAVE CONFIDENCE IN THEM. AND THIS LEVEL OF BIAS AND ANIMUS NOT ONLY DID THEY WANT TO STOP THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN, HE WANTED TO STOP YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT PETER STRZOK. PETER STRZOK THE FBI AGENT WHO WAS ON HILLARY CLINTON'S INVESTIGATION AND ARGUABLY THE LEAD RUSSIA INVESTIGATOR. NOT ONLY WANTED TO STOP HIS CAMPAIGN BUT ONCE HE WON GOT ON THE MUELLER PROBE BECAUSE HE WANTED TO IMPEACH HIM. THIS REPORT SHOWS THAT THERE WAS SPECIAL TREATMENT GIVEN TO HILLARY CLINTON IN THE INVESTIGATION OF HER CASE. THERE IS NOT STANDARD PROCEDURES FOLLOWED IN INVESTIGATING HER AND THERE WAS SPECIAL TREATMENT GIVEN. THERE IS NO DOUBT THAT THIS WAS NOT PROPER PROCESS AND THE REPORT SHOWS TIME AND TIME AGAIN HOW DIRECTOR COMEY AND OTHERS MADE MISTAKES, ERRORS IN JUDGMENT WERE DELIBERATE. PEOPLE CAN DRAW THEIR OWN CONCLUSIONS, BUT IT WAS IMPROPERLY HANDLED. Sean: LET ME SUM IT UP. HILLARY CLINTON COMMITTED FELONIES AND SHE SHOULD HAVE BEEN CHARGED AND THESE PEOPLE RAN INTERFERENCE FOR HER. WE HAVE AMPLE EVIDENCE OF BIAS CORRUPTION, POLITICS, MISCONDUCT AT THE HIGHEST LEVELS OF THE FBI. THE DOJ AND NOW THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION YET WON'T CALL THIS FOR WHAT IT IS MR. HOROWITZ? YOU CAN'T CONCLUDE THE OBVIOUS BIAS IMPACTED SOME AT THE YOU WERE ECHELON OF THE FBI AND THEIR WORK AND THEIR SO-CALLED INVESTIGATION? WHY? BECAUSE THAT WOULD TAINT THE PHONY RUSSIA CO-COLLUSION INVESTIGATION WE CANNOT HAVE A TWO TIERED JUSTICE SYSTEM IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA ONE FOR THE CLINTONS AND ONE FOR TRUMP AND ONE FOR EVERYBODY ELSE. WHILE THE FINDINGS OF THIS REPORT ARE IMPORTANT, WE MUST NOW DEMAND MORE. THIS IS A FIRST STEP. THERE HAS GOT TO BE ACCOUNTABILITY. WE HAVE GOT TO HAVE A BETTER SYSTEM OF GOVERNMENT OR THE
