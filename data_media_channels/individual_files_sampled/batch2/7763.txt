lately the koch brothers just can't stop making the case for the left a couple of weeks ago as we reported the sign they funded a study of medicare for all the likely costs of it what would actually cost to do and obviously they went into that with a particular goal in mind but unfortunately it turned out that they discovered that you know it looked like it would actually save trillions of dollars over our current system while at the same time providing better health care to more people and now we come to this week where they're just covering all the rest of the ground basically they have this new group that they set up I believe less than a year ago called in pursuit of which is mildly threatening yeah entirely know what that's about but they polled Americans about a number of different issues and going into it obviously the Koch brothers are hoping to show that Americans are you know like song capitalists and you know they they support certain libertarian principles to give an idea of one example of that one of the things the survey found was that eighty six percent of Americans said the right to personal property is key to a free and just society can you ask a question that more people are just going to answer yes to that really thinking about it that means virtually nothing no it means that fourteen percent of America might be communist there's fourteen percent of Americans that are either opposed to or not sure that we should have personal property that is interesting I'm not sure I agree but okay I didn't know that the country had that big a percentage of super left-wing idea anyway that's basically that's one of the very top level sort of like libertarian capitalist things that they were pulling about but they also pulled about a lot of particular policies as well and that's where yeah they might not have gotten exactly the result that they wanted I guess to their credit they still release the information as they did with their medicare-for-all study a couple of weeks ago so let's talk about some of the other findings from this coke funded study poll found that 66% of Americans would find quote government paid college tuition as either a very effective or somewhat effective solution to social barriers and fully half of all Americans said it would be very effective oops I did it again so I'm waiting for The Associated Press to write a story about no they didn't yeah hey so when the Koch brothers had this study about medicare-for-all and it turns out they liked it cost thirty two point six trillion dollars which is actually less than what health care costs today in fact according to that own study their own study if Medicare paid the doctors and the hospitals what they pay now so I actually did Medicare we would save two trillion dollars The Associated Press had to go do damage control for other Koch brothers by saying well but Bernie Sanders putting that out it's it's not fair not fair how and then they had to do a fact check after we sent them videos showing how wrong they were and the fact chick said yeah that's what the study says but we still don't like Bernie Sanders right so I can't wait for the Associated Press to fact-check this and go even though two thirds the country says they would like government-funded public education we're gonna pretend they said otherwise Associated Press you you're up people like private property remember that yeah go back to the property stuff I think the Koch brothers are just doing this to like make sure they're not in touch with the American people there's like oh cool running things got it like let's keep moving the opposite way of where everyone says we should be going yeah it may be maybe they were like are we sure are the wrong side of things all right what else are they on the wrong side okay well here's the big one you might have heard of this in in a number of different primary elections and a cycle that we're in a $15 minimum wage was almost as popular with 35% saying it would be a very effective solution 30% saying it would be a somewhat effective solution so again a big chunk higher than a majority of the country saying not just the minimum wage or a good minimum wage but a $15 an hour minimum wage wait but isn't that something like only straight white Bernie bros like and like no one else likes that and to support stuff like that you have to be a misogynist racist homophobe yeah yeah we but it turns out 65 percent of the country are apparently Bernie bros so people want higher wages of course of course they do the fact that that surprising is amazing but people in Washington in New York and the power centers have convinced themselves enough people do not want higher wages the Koch brothers are right Koch brothers by the way actually not only fight against higher wages and higher minimum wage all across the country they lobby against it they spend money to do it probably just paid less money if they just paid higher minimum wage than spending all that money a lot right actually of course they've done the math I mean it's not but but but not only that the at times have argued there should be no minimum wage at all okay so this is exactly counter to their things but they do the study and they're like totally opposed to our philosophy but that's that's actually kind of that gets into why I think it's at least somewhat surprising because of the power of propaganda in this country and how right workers have been beaten down after decade after decade after decade we had the head of Missouri's afl-cio on the damage report this morning to talk about proposition a being take him down and and he talked about this campaign that's been ongoing for a half century or so to convince workers that unions are their enemies and the thing is so the Koch brothers they everything you said about them is true but a lot of Republican politicians say the exact same thing they advocate for lower or no minimum wage Donald Trump twice in debate said that wages are too high and these politicians keep getting reelected didn't seem to hurt Donald Trump I didn't see in a lot of ads or anything like that and so I would not be surprised if more people have bought into some of the propaganda about minimum wage I mean I think two things one the numbers on this like are them least generous right like I mean they're they're trying to do everything they can to make sure this is as small as possible and and to it's still breaking through it's still you see the majority people do support some universal health care minimum wage yes assistance with attending college and affordable college tuition like and despite all the propaganda despite all this the state policy network which is like an anti-union union-busting there's quite a like all the money that is you know the American Legislative Exchange Council that funnels legislation to all different states to rollback workers rights that the brothers finance despite all that this is peeking through crap which means like I want another study like I want we should cross study this cuz I bet the numbers are even more staggering I actually am thankful to the coast that they did this study because they're this doesn't it's not in congruence with any other poll that's ever been done Medicare for all polls incredibly well so do all these positions including $15 minimum wage etcetera but the mainstream media doesn't pay attention to those polls they immediately ignore them this might actually get their attention because they're like oh these are our friends the Koch brothers that funded this and it and besides that maybe I'm beyond just you know tweaking the mainstream media but it is a little bit of dog man bites dog right so they're like oh wow that's a coke study and they might but it shows the Koch so wrong so that might get their attention the reality is these are massively popular positions in every single poll but yet when you turn on cable news you hear the exact opposite as if it's true and so there is a little bit of truth in the whole you know the fact that the the mainstream media is not representative of the American and I will say that having worked in in news and a lot of friends who are journalists that they go out of their way when they see a study that is positive in terms of Medicare for all that polt and positive in terms of minimum wage and they go out of their way to find the opposite so you won't go and you'll get your Heritage Foundation study you'll go and all these other right-wing think tanks in order to sort of create some sort of balance the cover is blown I mean it's 2018 and people I mean were more unequal than we were during the Roaring Twenties right before the you know the Great Depression and it's like can we stop pretending that there's any kind of balance if there's a wall I'm gonna get our right-wing studies in no stop it like yeah but that's an assault on the truth in favor of neutrality right and so the calendar yeah no no it's real neutrality but it's not objectivity right neutrality is 70 percent of Americans saying the wall street should be regulated that's that is I'm sorry that's objective lead this poll shows in almost every poll shows in this case is 69 percent of Americans say they want Wall Street to be tightly regulated neutrality says some want Wall Street to be regulated as some don't wait a minute you're calling it even when it's not it's 7 to 3 call it what it actually is but they do go out of their way to do that because they're cowed by Republicans who constantly attack them so they help right-wing framing by pretending things are neutral when they are not the American people are not unclear so 70% of them say god damnit regulate Wall Street 71% of them according to this coke funded study and again almost every poll say we want guaranteed child care you say that on cable news I guarantee you you will be attacked this is all radical so how we're gonna afford it it's not practical that seems like a radical position are 70% of Americans radical can I ask you a question do you think that these kinds of polls matter I mean sure they matter to people like us who care and you know we believe in that democracy should ultimately work but like when it comes to I mean do we have to make the economic argument which I know we have at the Koch brothers sponsored other data that showed that it was more affordable to have Medicare for all than the current system we have like a moral framing and then there's a pragmatic framing but I think why this is so useful is that it shows that when people try to hide behind pragmatism and pretend the cokes don't do this but I mean liberals do this all the time they pretend it's not that we're opposed to single-payer medicare-for-all $15 minimum wage it's just that they're not viable share not doable because America isn't ready yet good luck passing that and you anywhere outside of the coasts and now we know that that's not true right I mean you can't support that it does have support and it's not a radical idea and so when people say the opposite we know that they are actually ideologically committed to stopping something like single-payer or they're uninformed yeah by the way can we just mention because we've we've talked around this just a little bit but inside of this study as well of sort of burying the lede I guess 55 percent said a government-run health care system would be very or somewhat effective policy response so in 92 percent said that they are having problems with the cost of health care which is unsurprising what a focus on that a little bit but look at the framing to Francesca's point earlier government-run health care is a way of framing it so you get a negative response instead of Medicare with a popular Medicare for all okay so they frame it in what they think is gonna get the most negative response is still yeah give me government-run health care government guaranteeing child care well they're mean government-funded public education the answer is yes how many times do I have to say yes and when you do say yes again here's what they will say on cable news well I mean of course an American if they caught and they are faced with actual facts they cannot deny although they almost never get caught because they almost never let progressives on air so they're never caught in a situation where they are confronted by the fact that they are basically look I don't think that they're doing it with intended or with malice but they are in essence lying to the American people when they say that people don't want it when they clearly clearly do want any if you shove the poll in their face on the air which again it almost never happens so if you do do that they go well I mean yeah they might want it but they don't really know how much your cause wait a minute though you never said that about the wars and you never said that about the tax cuts did you certainly say that about the current health care system yeah right that's the other issue right so there's this which you brought up Francesca which is regardless kind of this poll and we all know and Nicasio Cortes brought this up the other day to Chris Cuomo which is that we all know no one ever asks people where they're gonna find the money to fund a war no one's gonna ever ask people where they're gonna find the money to offer the rich a tax cut it's only when there are things that actually help most people yeah that were supposed to scratch our heads and scramble and figure out where we're gonna find the money for it could you imagine after 9/11 and I mean in that case it's incredibly egregious because we had to war with the wrong country but if when the Republicans said hey we need to go to war because of 9/11 and the at a bare minimum what the reporter should have said is well Iraq didn't attack us though but they didn't even say that but getting beyond like could you imagine if they said well you say the American people want war but does they know how much it costs that's not very practical man could you imagine they would never dare say that but what something that helps your family they said immediately it's almost as if they have an Establishment bias hmm a war that is still not over by the way the one that was started after 9/11 I also um I think that I think that what bothers me about this also is that the left is always called ideological right and that I think that was sort of the takeaway from this week's election was that when sort of progressive insurgents did not win it was like well we see that Democrats are not motivated by ideology it's like I'm sorry one of all this which are part of the planks of these progressive Dems one of this is ideological there's nothing ideological there's not a fringe or radical about it it's fairly mainstream and when people on the Left progressives insurgent socialists whatever people who run the gamut when they win it's a fluke when they lose it's because their ideas just aren't popular to the framing as though is very convenient yeah the press is a massive massive establishment bias yeah so I mean to guess what guys Jane don't admit so if you don't is that they're like but I'm not establishment okay thanks for clearing that up yeah self-identifying establishment so Jessica's point when a somebody on the Left argues for position they go oh that's so ideological as if it's like an insult right whereas if a constructor does they're like that's principled see he's fighting on principle whereas the left is just being ideological hence now that's the kind of guy right so and I want to just say I I'm now interviewed I think hundreds of candidates across the country and unravelled headquarters another show that we have and what they say is overwhelmingly the three issues that everyone is bringing up by the way Democrat Republican or independent is one is health care killing us we're in constant stress over am I gonna have insurance am I gotta be able to pay for it am I gonna get bankrupt etc there is health care is destroying our health okay this the state like people in walk again on TV have no idea how bad it is right now in the country you knock on people so that's the first thing they say secondly is wages wages for God's sake wages third thing which was actually a little bit surprising to me not college for all which I advocate for but student they're rushing it's an albatross around the neck of the whole country so these are the issues that actual Americans care about and how often are they talked about on television almost never and if you dare do it they call you a radical go knock on any Americans or and see if they're a radical look at any polling see if they're radical who's the radical one if 70% of Americas are on our side two easy ways follow young turks want us hit the subscribe
