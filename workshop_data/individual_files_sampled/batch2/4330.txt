Peter I have to go to you first because you called Cavanaugh as spectacular pick why well because I think that he has intellectual and moral integrity he's extremely smart very well-qualified his opinions are outstanding I'll give Donald Trump credit he picked someone who was the antithesis of himself he is he's a person that is as I said intellectually and morally outstanding I knew Brett in the White House he was staff secretary before that he was worked in the legal counsel's office he's meticulous he's calm he's temperamentally conservative he's reliable everybody who worked with Brett had a very very high opinion of him and so I really do think he's a spectacular pick I am a fierce critic of Donald Trump but I'm capable of I'm saying when he does something right I think in this case he did something right Brett I want to ask you about politico's reporting that Justice Kennedy favored Cavanaugh not a I'll leave if you give him the seat but do you does it surprise you that that could have influenced President Trump who truly likes to go his own path look Cavanaugh was a clerk for Kennedy and it must have pleased Kennedy to know that Cavanaugh would have been a likely likely successor and by the way Cavanaugh is I suspect will if he's if he's confirmed look like a justice in the mold of Kennedy which is he's not going to be a doctrinaire conservative he's capable of thinking for himself he was not the most but he's not always the most conservative judge on on every single panel and some of his rulings some of his thinking but one of the one that keeps coming up which is his belief the president should be immune from certain investigations in civil suits that was written in 2009 when President Obama was president that may be a diol thinking that will serve a Democratic president far into the future once Donald Trump is in the past so I agree with what Pete Waner just said I think he's a terrific pick and I think he's not the hill but the Democratic Party wants to die on I want stay on that point because you know Democrats are going to push it I have a quote from it in 2009 when he wrote we should not burden a sitting president with civil suits Criminal Investigations or criminal prosecutions the president's job is difficult enough as it is and the country loses when the president's focus is distracted by the burdens of civil litigation or criminal investigation and possible prosecution Democrats have already made it clear that this is going to be an issue in Cavanaugh's hearing I want to share what Cory Booker said you picked the one guy who has specifically written that a president in fact should not be the subject of a criminal investigation which the president is right now so this seems to be them of all the people the most self-serving person he could choose in order to protect himself from this criminal investigation Jennifer I'd love for you to weigh in here to say this about a civil suit is one thing but that the president shouldn't be subjected to a criminal investigation if he broke the law does this not make Cavanaugh pretty vulnerable right so I think one of the interesting things about that article is he's talking about this as a matter of policy so he's basically saying Congress should pass a law that exempts the president but what that means by implication is that there's no constitutional bar and right now there's no law that prohibits the president from being prosecuted so there is a way to read this as potentially leaving open the possibility although he's clearly urging Congress to do something that would protect the president I don't think anybody should be surprised that that we have a president who who is nominating a very conservative justice this is why elections really matter and there is a lot that hangs in the balance here obviously roe v wade the future of the Affordable Care Act and the ability for the requirement that insurers continue to ensure those with pre-existing conditions privacy rights in the digital age environmental regulations gun the the ability of Congress and States to impose reasonable regulations on the use of guns all of these things hang in the balance and and I think we have a conservative president who nominated a conservative justice and I don't think anybody should be surprised about that all right Matt let's look at the big picture because here's what Kavanagh wrote about his judicial philosophy a judge must interpret statutes as written and a judge must interpret the Constitution is written informed by history and tradition and precedent is that good enough for conservatives oh yeah I mean you don't see a lot of conservatives getting mad this morning right John McCain came out pretty quickly and said this is a pretty great pick there's not a lot of the lukewarm is from one senator right now is Rand Paul and I don't think it really has anything to do towards W Bush I think it has to do with Cavanaugh's sense of the Fourth Amendment and the collection of metadata he ruled basically on the opposite side of the where the carpenter' court was saying that the government doesn't have access to your third party data out there but no conservatives are very happy but what I would add and this is an important one he came up in an early Obamacare challenge and he talked about the philosophy of deference and he said that we should the courts should avoid the temptation to get into big weighty constitutional issues on big weighty laws like have a sense of restraints going into a place well this is this is a in a 2011 case here whose name escapes me he was in the dissent and said we should not get into this case because we should basically hang back and let the legislative process on such a big thing which affects so many people's lives the judicial branch shouldn't be getting involved in that right away we should wait back and defer to the legislative and political process this speaks to temperament this is a much more John Roberts approach than it is a Scalia approach it is saying that we shouldn't jump into something we should defer to the majorities that isn't that I think could have some implications on all kinds of things including his potential approaches to roe versus oh well that's exactly at an in its 2006 confirmation for the DC Circuit Court he said explicitly Roe is the law of the land that it was reaffirmed in the Casey case Casey versus Planned Parenthood in 1992 I mean conservative judges believe in originalism but they but also believe in what Scalia one's called faint-hearted originalism which means a great deal of deference to start decisis to judicial precedents so I don't think I think it is unreasonable to think that Kavanagh will be the deciding vote to overturn Roe versus Wade there might be decisions at the margins of abortion law but this conservative judges in in his tradition understand the court should not be in the business of social engineering and Peter are we gonna learn more about Cavanaugh in the confirmation hearings you know his views on specific issues or is it far too political to get specific and he's just trying to get through this process well I think it's both I mean you are gonna learn something about him both in terms of the analysis that goes on but you're going to see him testify and he's going to be grilled and you're gonna see how he handles himself and what his temperament is and and how quick he is on his feet and and and all that but he's gonna follow the PlayBook that really every justice has since Bork which is he's not going to go too far or go into specific cases I think that's a reasonable position to to to have Democrats won't be happy about it but in the end it won't really matter because the Republicans have have the votes I don't imagine that any Republicans are going to break away and I and I'm guessing the several of the red state Democrats are going to vote for him this is a storm a political time but I think that the bread Cavanaugh is going to is going to sail through and I think by the end of this process people will be more encouraged by by what they see even than they and they are and they are now you can't go through a Supreme Court confirmation hearing and not reveal some of who you are jennipher the federalist society is organized they have got a list at the ready for the president whether it's for this pick or lower courts there's the left I'm a similar organization so the left the left is is organized the left does have equivalent vetting procedures in place but it's but it's true the Federalist Society is effective they are incredibly well-heeled and they've done a really good job of presenting President Trump with a lot of very conservative justices that will change the future of the judiciary and rulings for a very very long time it's why elections matter so much this was huge on the agenda in the presidential election last time around and it should be on people's minds when they go to the polls in November for the midterms and and the future of the Senate right now who's the equivalent on the left so so there's there's a the American Constitution Society which does a lot of work in terms of looking at the the kind of liberal approaches there's other organizations as well that do vetting of judges that send names up as well Brett you said this is not the hill that Democrats want to die on you don't want to fight this so what do they do they win on elections on on issues where where Democrats can make a difference and where they're going to be popular look I think Kavanagh should be confirmed a hundred to zero just as I think someone like Elena Kagan should be confirmed a hundred to zero the point is if you have a well-qualified judge who's within the broad mainstream of the American movement doesn't have any moral disqualifiers you should go back to the tradition we had as recently as Sandra Day O'Connor she was confirmed 9999 to zero but looked a Democrats are gonna lose on this issue and it's gonna make them seem extreme and petty there are a lot of issues there's a lot there's a lot immigration is one of them foreign policy is another economic policy is a third a lot of issues where Democrats can win elections but they're not gonna win it on this one they're just going to remind they're gonna remind conservatives and independent voters that maybe the Democrats are too far to the left for their tastes and it's actually going to help Donald Trump in the election if they make a federal case or if they if they try to die on this hill it's going to help them Republicans in the midterm if this is such a strong pick what does this do for president Trump's legacy this is the thing that Republicans who hold their nose about Trump this is the but Gorsuch you know analysis of Trump so they got him that tax cuts they got in the Supreme Court picks and they got some deregulation and I would point out that this also backs up the deregulatory effort as does Gorsuch those two justices potentially have some of the strongest kind of anti deference to regulatory agencies out there so they're going to be very skeptical of EPA going out there and making their own law but they're also going to be skeptical we've already seen this with Gorsuch of immigration enforcement claims by the federal government you might find that on this side holding the fort against Donald Trump is Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh hey there I'm Chris Hayes from MSNBC thanks for watching MSNBC on YouTube
