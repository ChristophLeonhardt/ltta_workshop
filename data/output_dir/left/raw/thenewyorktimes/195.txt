1
00:00:00,830 --> 00:00:03,320
This is the person that police
say killed 10 people

2
00:00:03,320 --> 00:00:05,960
at a Texas high school.

3
00:00:05,960 --> 00:00:08,170
And this is his Facebook
page.

4
00:00:08,170 --> 00:00:10,340
Since the shooting,
it’s been taken down.

5
00:00:10,340 --> 00:00:12,650
But one thing notable
about the photos

6
00:00:12,650 --> 00:00:14,910
is the appearance
of several symbols,

7
00:00:14,910 --> 00:00:17,570
some seeming to
contradict others.

8
00:00:17,570 --> 00:00:19,070
Here’s what we know
about them.

9
00:00:19,070 --> 00:00:21,400
On his hat is this heart pin.

10
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:23,360
It’s sold on numerous
websites labeled

11
00:00:23,360 --> 00:00:26,210
as a bisexual pride pin.

12
00:00:26,210 --> 00:00:28,340
Next, on the jacket.

13
00:00:28,340 --> 00:00:30,760
This hammer and sickle pin
with a red star

14
00:00:30,760 --> 00:00:32,970
is a common symbol of communism.

15
00:00:32,970 --> 00:00:35,890
It was most notably
on the Soviet flag.

16
00:00:35,890 --> 00:00:39,830
The suspect writes that to
him, it symbolized rebellion.

17
00:00:39,830 --> 00:00:41,570
And, indeed, on some websites

18
00:00:41,570 --> 00:00:44,400
the pins are marketed 
as symbols of anarchy.

19
00:00:44,910 --> 00:00:46,470
On the opposite lapel

20
00:00:46,470 --> 00:00:49,080
is what looks to
be a Japanese flag.

21
00:00:49,080 --> 00:00:50,640
The suspect
apparently believed

22
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:53,090
it symbolizes
kamikaze tactics.

23
00:00:53,380 --> 00:00:55,530
Those were the tactics
of Japanese pilots

24
00:00:55,530 --> 00:00:58,380
who intentionally crashed
their planes into enemy ships

25
00:00:58,380 --> 00:01:00,540
during World War II.

26
00:01:00,540 --> 00:01:04,830
Here is the German iron cross,
an award for military heroism,

27
00:01:04,830 --> 00:01:07,780
not issued since World War II.

28
00:01:07,780 --> 00:01:11,150
It’s now often used as a hate
symbol by white supremacists

29
00:01:11,150 --> 00:01:13,130
but not exclusively.

30
00:01:13,130 --> 00:01:16,490
The suspect writes that the
cross symbolizes bravery.

31
00:01:16,910 --> 00:01:19,900
This symbol is associated
with a satanic idol.

32
00:01:19,900 --> 00:01:22,970
Pins with this symbol are
often marketed

33
00:01:22,970 --> 00:01:24,770
as endorsed 
by the Church of Satan.

34
00:01:24,770 --> 00:01:27,710
The suspect writes 
that it symbolizes evil.

35
00:01:27,710 --> 00:01:30,650
The Cthulhu here
is a creature that’s often

36
00:01:30,650 --> 00:01:33,930
found in science fiction
and described as dead,

37
00:01:33,930 --> 00:01:34,850
but dreaming.

38
00:01:34,850 --> 00:01:37,310
There are several ways people
interpret the Cthulhu,

39
00:01:37,310 --> 00:01:41,540
but the suspect writes that
to him, it symbolizes power.

40
00:01:41,540 --> 00:01:43,370
Finally, in total
contradiction

41
00:01:43,370 --> 00:01:45,590
to the suspect’s
alleged actions,

42
00:01:45,590 --> 00:00:00,000
we see him wearing
the peace symbol.
