Hello Everybody... This is just a regular Friday night.. At the Eh Bee household.
Tonight, we become.. The stick family. Tell me– does it– is that gonna hurt if I press it? Mama Bee: No. Papa Bee: Oh my god.
You're good.
Monkey Face, you're up.
Ladies and gentlemen, this is the Stick Figure Family.
*electronic music*
Thanks for watching everybody!
Oh my god,  this is so cool.
Are we doing lunges?
Wow
