The Fairly New York Times and they're
inventing for all slaves without any
evidence no witnesses no nothing
connected supposedly years and years ago
I never met these people I don't even
know who they are they made up stories
filed right before the election
the largest shareholder in The Times is
Carlos Slim now Carlos Slim is you know
comes from Mexico he's given many
millions of dollars to the Clintons and
their initiative so Carlos Slim largest
owner of the paper from Mexico reporters
at the New York Times they're not
journalists they're corporate lobbyists
for Carlos Slim and for Hillary Clinton
