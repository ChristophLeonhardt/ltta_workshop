IT'S EXCEEDINGLY UNLIKELY THAT 
-- 
>>> ALL RIGHT. 
RIGHT NOW SENATE MAJORITY 
LEADER MITCH McCONNELL IS 
HOLDING A NEWS CONFERENCE ON 
THE CONFIRMATION OF JUSTICE 
KAVANAUGH. 
LET'S LISTEN. 
>> THE OFFICIAL SWEARING IN OF 
JUSTICE KAVANAUGH. 
WITH THAT I WILL BE HAPPY TO 
THROW IT OPEN. 
>> SENATOR, YOU SAID ON FOX 
NEWS, ASKED ABOUT MERRICK 
GARLAND, DO YOU SEE A SITUATION 
IN WHICH ONE PARTY CONTROLS THE 
WHITE HOUSE AND ONE PARTY 
CONTROLS THE U.S. SENATE WE 
COULD GET A SUPREME COURT 
JUSTICE THROUGH? 
>> OF COURSE. 
BUT LET'S TALK ABOUT EXACTLY 
WHAT THE TRADITION IS IN A 
PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION YEAR WHEN 
YOU HAVE A SENATE IN THE HANDS 
OF ONE PARTY AND THE WHITE 
HOUSE IN THE HANDS OF ANOTHER. 
PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION YEAR IS 
WHAT WE HAD IN 202016 -- 2016. 
YOU WOULD HAVE GO BACK TO THE 
1880s A VIRGINIA CAN ANY OKAY 
-- VACANCY WAS FILLED BY A 
DIFFERENT PARTY FROM THE 
PRESIDENT. 
YOU RECALL FROM 2016 THAT JOE 
BIDEN VOLUNTEERED. 
WE DIDN'T HAVE A VACANCY IN 
1992, A PRESIDENTIAL YEAR IN 
WHICH THERE WAS A PARTY IN 
CONTROL OF THE WHITE HOUSE, A 
DIFFERENT PARTY IN CONTROL OF 
THE SENATE BUT JOE VOLUNTEERED 
THAT IF A VACANCY OCCURRED THEY 
WOULDN'T FILL IT. 
YOU PLAY RECALL FROM OUR 
DISCUSSIONS IN 2016 THAT CHUCK 
SCHUMER AND HARRY REID SAID 18 
MONTHS BEFORE THE END OF THE 
BUSH 43 PRESIDENCY THAT IF A 
VACANCY OCCURRED THEY WOULDN'T 
FILL IT. 
THAT'S BECAUSE THERE WAS A 
DEMOCRATIC SENATE AND A 
REPUBLICAN PRESIDENT. 
SO, WHAT I DID WAS ENTIRELY 
CONSISTENT WITH AMERICAN 
HISTORY GOING BACK TO THE 1800s 
OF WHAT HAPPENS WHEN A VACANCY 
OCCURS IN THE MIDDLE OF A 
PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION YEAR AND 
YOU HAVE ONE PARTY IN THE WHITE 
HOUSE AND ANOTHER PARTY IN 
CONTROL OF THE SENATE. 
>> ARE YOU FEARFUL AT ALL ONE 
DAY DEMOCRATS TAKE BACK THE 
SENATE THAT THEY COULD SAY TO A 
REPUBLICAN PRESIDENT, WE WON'T 
DO ANY NOMINATIONS IN ANY YEAR? 
>> THEY COULD. 
I DON'T THINK THAT WOULD BE 
SUSTAINABLE POLITICALLY. 
IT WOULDN'T BE A GOOD ARGUMENT 
TO MAKE. 
I NOTICE ONE OF THE DEMOCRATIC 
SENATORS SAID IF THEY GOT THE 
SENATE BACK THIS YEAR, THEY 
COULD NOT DO ANY JUDGES FOR THE 
NEXT TWO YEARS. 
I DON'T THINK THAT WORKS POLL 
-- WORKS POLITICALLY. 
EVERYBODY KNEW IF THE SHOE WAS 
ON THE OTHER FOOT THEY WOULDN'T 
FILL THE VACANCY. 
EVERYBODY SMILED BECAUSE YOU 
KNEW IF IT WAS A DEMOCRATIC 
PRESIDENT AND -- I MEAN A 
REPUBLICAN PRESIDENT AND A 
DEMOCRATIC SENATE THEY WOULDN'T 
HAVE FILLED THE VACANCY. 
>> SENATOR, WHAT IS YOUR 
MESSAGE TO THE PEOPLE THAT ARE 
ANGRY ABOUT THIS CONFIRMATION, 
THE PEOPLE BANGING ON THE DOORS 
OF THE SUPREME COURT, PEOPLE 
THAT YOU SAY ARE IN YOUR FACE. 
WHAT DO YOU SAY TO THEM? 
>> LOOK. 
I HAVE ZERO TOLERANCE FOR THE 
KIND OF BEHAVIOR THAT JUSTICE 
KAVANAUGH WAS ACCUSED OF BUT I 
THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO REMIND 
EVERYBODY THAT THERE WAS NO 
CORROBORATING EVIDENCE. 
I WAS CHAIRMAN OF THE ETHICS 
COMMITTEE IN 1995. 
WHEN I INVESTIGATED AND LATER 
MADE THE MOTION TO EXPEL FROM 
THE SENATE SENATOR BOB PACKWOOD 
CHAIRMAN OF THE FINANCE 
COMMITTEE OF MY PARTY ON THESE 
KINDS OF ALLEGATIONS. 
I SAID DURING THE ROY MOORE 
SPECIAL ELECTION, I BELIEVED 
THE WOMEN. 
THERE WERE MULTIPLE -- AMPLE 
EVIDENCE, MULTIPLE EXAMPLES 
OVER AND OVER AND OVER. 
SO, I DON'T THINK THIS MEANS IN 
ANY WAY THAT THE REPUBLICANS OR 
AMERICANS IN GENERAL CONDON 
THIS KIND OF BEHAVIOR BUT IT 
MUST BE PROVEN. 
AFTER ALL, THIS IS AMERICA. 
>> WOULD YOU SAY THE COUNTRY IS 
OVERLY DIVIDED? 
>> LOOK, WE GO THROUGH THESE 
PERIODS. 
WE HAD BIG FIGHTS OVER OTHER 
THINGS AND THE COUNTRY WILL BE 
JUST FINE. 
>> WHAT IS THE PROSPECT FOR THE 
MIDTERMS NOW POST KAVANAUGH. 
WHAT DOES IT MEAN? 
>> THAT IS AN INTERESTING 
QUESTION. 
WE HAVE NOTICED, BY THE WAY, 
SOME ENERGY PICK UP ON OUR 
SIDE. 
I MEAN, EVERYBODY KNOWS THAT 
THE DEMOCRATS ARE QUITE 
ENERGIZED AND HAVE BEEN FOR 
SOME TIME. 
THEY ARE ANXIOUS TO SEND THE 
PIPELINE A MESSAGE. 
THEY ARE ENERGIZED. 
WHAT I THINK THIS HAS DONE FOR 
US IS PROVIDE THE KIND OF 
ADRENALIN SHOT THAT WE HAVE NOT 
BEEN ABLE TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO 
ACHIEVE IN ANY OTHER WAY. 
SO, WE SEE THAT MOVEMENT. 
I NOTICED ON CBS YESTERDAY 
THEIR BATTLEGROUND TRACKER POLL 
HAD OUR CANDIDATE IN TENNESSEE 
UP BY EIGHT POINTS. 
I HAD NEVER SEEN A SURVEY LIKE 
THAT IN TENNESSEE IN RECENT 
WEEKS. 
WE THINK THERE IS EVIDENCE, 
LAWRENCE, THAT THIS WILL BE 
HELPFUL TO US NEXT MONTH. 
>> DO YOU THINK THIS WILL 
PREVENT YOU FROM FACING ANOTHER 
PRIMARY CHALLENGE IN 2020? 
>> LOOK. 
I DID JUST FINE IN THE PRIMARY 
THE LAST TIME. 
I WOULD REMIND YOU GUYS I 
CARRIED 118 OUT OF 119 
COUNTIES. 
I'M NOT AFRAID OF A PRIMARY. 
I THINK I HAVE DEMONSTRATED 
AGAINST A CREDIBLE CANDIDATE. 
I KNOW HOW TO HANDLE IT. 
>> NOT AFRAID BUT SOLIDIFIES 
SUPPORT. 
>> ANYBODY CAN FILE. 
IT'S A FREE COUNTRY. 
AND I'M SURE I WILL HAVE -- ONE 
THING ABOUT BEING IN THE JOB 
I'M IN, YOU GET A LOT OF SLINGS 
AND ARROWS. 
YOUR APPROVAL RATING TAKES A 
BEATING FROM TIME TO TIME AND 
THAT IS A GOOD RECRUITMENT TOOL 
FOR THE OTHER SIDE. 
I'M SURE THAT THEY WILL BE ABLE 
TO GET A CREDIBLE CANDIDATE AND 
I WILL BE READY TO DEAL WITH 
IT. 
>> WHAT TOUCHING THIS MEANS 
FOUR LEGACY. 
WE LOOKED AT A SITUATION WHERE 
THE COURT COULD HAVE BEEN A 
LIBERAL COURT INTO 2016. 
YOU MADE A BIG GAMBLE ON 
HOLDING UP PRESIDENT OBAMA'S 
VACANCY PICK. 
WHAT DO YOU THINK THIS MEANS 
FOR YOU? 
I TALKED TO PEOPLE THAT SAID 
THIS PUTS YOU IN CONSERVATISM 
TO ENSURE THAT THE SUPREME 
COURT IS CONSERVATIVE FOR 
GENERATIONS TO COME. 
HOW DO YOU THINK HISTORY JUDGES 
YOU. 
>> HARD TO JUDGE YOUR OWN 
LEGACY BUT I THINK IT'S THE 
SINGLE MOST IMPORTANT THING 
THAT I HAVE BEEN INVOLVED IN IN 
MY CAREER. 
THE COURT IS THE SINGLE BIGGEST 
WAY YOU CAN HAVE A LONG-TERM 
IMPACT ON THE COUNTRY. 
THE ONLY THING WE DO WITH 
LIFETIME APPOINTMENTS. 
I LIKE THE TAX BILL. 
I LIKE WHAT WE DID ON 
DEREGULATION. 
BUT AS SOON AS THE POLITICAL 
WINDS SHIFT WE WILL BE BACK ON 
THE TAX CODE. 
I REMIND PEOPLE THAT THE '86 
TAX REFORM ACT LASTED FOUR 
YEARS. 
AND, SO, IF YOU WANT TO HAVE A 
LONG-TERM IMPACT AND ALL OF US 
WOULD LIKE TO DO THAT, THE 
SINGLE MOST SIGNIFICANT WAY TO 
DO IT IS JUDICIAL APPOINTMENTS. 
MY PARTY HAS NOT BEEN IN THAT 
POSITION ALL THAT LONG. 
GO BACK 100 YEARS. 
20 OF THE LAST HUNDRED YEARS 
HAVE REPUBLICANS HAD THE 
PRESIDENCY, HOUSE AND SENATE AT 
THE SAME TIME. 
THESE OPPORTUNITIES HAVE NOT 
COME ALONG THAT OFTEN FOR US. 
I DO THINK IT'S THE MOST 
CONSEQUENTIAL THING THAT I HAVE 
BEEN INVOLVED IN. 
>> SOME ARE BLAMING YOU FOR 
BREAKING THE SENATE AND KILLING 
DEMOCRACY. 
WHAT ABOUT THOSE WHO HAVE THE 
OTHER VIEW OF WHAT YOU HAVE 
DONE? 
>> THEY CAN SPEAK FOR 
THEMSELVES. 
THERE IS NOTHING DONE BROKEN IN 
OUR DEMOCRACY. 
YOU HAVE SEEN IT ON DISPLAY. 
JOHN MEACHAM WROTE A WONDERFUL 
BOOK WITHIN THE LAST YEAR I 
RECOMMEND CALLED THE SOUL OF 
AMERICA. 
WHAT HE DOES IS -- DID YOU READ 
IT? 
YOU SHOULD. 
I MEAN, IT TAKES US THROUGH OUR 
LOW POINTS AND ONE OF MINE THAT 
I WOULD CITE BECAUSE IT WAS THE 
DEMOCRATS, WOODROW WILSON 
DEBUTED BIRTH OF A NATION IN 
THE WHITE HOUSE WHICH LED TO 
THE RESURGENCE OF THE CLAN IN 
THE 1920s HERE IN AMERICA. 
SO, HE KIND OF GOES THROUGH THE 
VARIOUS LOW POINTS IN AMERICAN 
HISTORY AND HOW WE RECOVERED. 
THE COUNTRY WILL BE FINE. 
JUSTICE SCALIA SAID EVER TEN 
HORNED DICTATOR IN THE WORLD 
HAS A BILL OF RIGHTS. 
WHAT PROTECTS AMERICA IS THE 
SEPARATION OF POWERS. 
AND THE GENIUSES WHO FOUNDED 
THIS COUNTRY ASSUMED THAT 
PEOPLE WOULD DO THE WORST 
THING. 
THAT'S WHY WE HAVE ALL THESE 
DIFFERENT CHECKS AND BALANCES 
IN PLACE. 
SO, THE COUNTRY WILL BE JUST 
FINE. 
I THINK A LOT OF YOUNG PEOPLE 
WHO HAVE NOT EXPERIENCED OTHER 
LOW POINTS THINK THAT WHATEVER 
PROBLEMS WE ARE HAVING AT ANY 
GIVEN MOMENT ARE UNIQUE. 
LISTEN, THIS IS NOWHERE NEAR AS 
SIGNIFICANT AS WHAT WAS GOING 
ON IN THE '60s, FIGHTING 
THROUGH THE WHOLE CIVIL RIGHTS 
ISSUE AND COMING OUT IN THE 
RIGHT PLACE. 
I'M POSITIVE AND UPBEAT ABOUT 
THE COUNTRY. 
I KNOW EVERYBODY ISN'T BUT WE 
WILL BE FINE. 
>> THE "NEW YORK TIMES" SAID 
YOU DIDN'T WANT TO WAIVER FROM 
BRETT KAVANAUGH, QUOTING THAT 
YOU ARE TOUGHER THAN MULE  . 
>> THAT IS STRONG. 
>> LET ME TELL YOU WHY I FELT 
STRONGLY ABOUT IT. 
>> YOU HAD A PERSON'S LIFE 
BEING DESTROYED HERE BY 
UNSUBSTANTIATED ALLEGATIONS. 
I THOUGHT WE OWED IT TO JUDGE 
KAVANAUGH TO VOTE. 
HE WANTED A VOTE. 
IMAGINE WHAT WITHDRAWAL WOULD 
HAVE LOOKED LIKE. 
IT WOULD HAVE LOOKED LIKE 
CONCEDING THE ALLEGATION. 
SO, I FELT LIKE WE OWED IT TO 
HIM AND TO THE COUNTRY TO WORK 
OUR WAY THROUGH THIS AND I WAS 
ALWAYS OPPOSED TO WITHDRAWAL. 
I'M NOT SUGGESTING THAT THE 
PRESIDENT WAS IN FAVOR OF 
WITHDRAWAL EITHER, BUT THE 
MOMENT THAT EVERYBODY WOULD 
HAVE HAD SECOND THOUGHTS 
OBVIOUSLY WAS AFTER DR. FORD 
TESTIFIED. 
SHE WAS VERY CREDIBLE. 
I DID TALK TO THE PRESIDENT 
AFTER THAT AND MY SUGGESTION 
WAS WE BOTH AGREED SHE WAS VERY 
CREDIBLE. 
MY SUGGESTION WAS THAT THIS IS 
HALFTIME. 
LET'S SEE WHAT IT LIKES LOOK AT 
THE END OF THE GAME. 
I THINK AFTER JUDGE KAVANAUGH'S 
TESTIMONY EVERYBODY FELT BETTER 
ABOUT HIM AND OUR ABILITIES TO 
PREVAIL AND WE HAD THE FBI 
INVESTIGATION AND THE 
PARAMETERS WERE DETERMINED IN 
MY OFFICE FRIDAY A WEEK AGO. 
I HAD THE SENATE REPUBLICAN 
MEMBERS OF THE JUDICIARY 
COMMITTEE THERE AND SENATOR 
COLLINS, SENATOR MURKOWSKI AND 
SENATOR MURKOWSKI, SENATOR 
COLLINS AND SENATOR FLAKE 
BASICALLY AGREED AMONG THE 
THREE OF THEM WHAT THEY THOUGHT 
THE SCOPE OF THE FBI 
INVESTIGATION OUGHT TO BE. 
THREE POINTS. 
NUMBER ONE, IT NEEDED TO BE 
DONE WITHIN A WEEK BECAUSE HE 
HAD BEEN INVESTIGATED SIX TIMES 
IN THE COURSE OF HIS CAREER. 
TALK TO ANYBODY THAT DR. FORD 
MENTIONED AND NUMBER 3, 
RAMIREZ, TALK TO RAMIREZ AND 
ANYBODY RAMIREZ MENTIONED. 
ALL OF THAT WAS DONE WITHIN THE 
SEVEN DAY PERIOD. 
AND LAST THURSDAY THE THREE OF 
THEM AND LOTS OF OTHER MEMBERS 
WENT DOWN AND LOOKED AT THE FBI 
FILES. 
IT'S ONE FILE. 
THE REASON THOSE AREN'T COPIED 
IS THEY ARE NOT THE PROPERTY OF 
THE SENATE. 
THEY ARE THE PROPERTY OF THE 
EXECUTIVE BRANCH AND IT'S 
HIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL. 
EVERYBODY WHO WANTED TO READ 
THE FBI REPORT COULD AND MANY 
DID. 
WE STAYED IN ALL NIGHT 
THURSDAY. 
ANYBODY WHO WANTED TO READ THE 
FBI REPORT COULD. 
THAT LED TO FRIDAY'S VOTE. 
TWO OF THE THREE MEMBERS AGREED 
TO SUPPORT -- DECIDED TO 
SUPPORT JUDGE KAVANAUGH BECAUSE 
THEY FOUND THE SUPPLEMENTAL FBI 
REPORT, NUMBER 7, THE 7th FBI 
REPORT CONVINCING THAT THERE 
WAS NO CORROBORATING EVIDENCE. 
>> YOU HAVE TALKED ABOUT THE IN 
YOUR FACE PROTESTERS. 
ARE YOU CONCERNED ABOUT YOUR 
SECURITY OR THAT OF YOUR 
COLLEAGUES. 
>> I WOULD RATHER NOT TALK 
ABOUT SECURITY. 
ITCHING THE TACTICS WERE 
HELPFUL TO ME IN UNIFYING OUR 
SIDE. 
I THINK THERE WERE TWO THINGS 
THAT INSPIRED OUR PEOPLE TO 
CONFIRM THIS NOMINEE. 
ONE, PRESUMPTION OF INNOCENCE. 
THERE WAS NO CORROBORATING 
EVIDENCE. 
NUMBER TWO, THE TACTICS WERE 
DESIGNED TO INTIMIDATE. 
I KNOW THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN 
PEACEFUL PROTESTERS AND PEOPLE 
TRYING TO GET IN YOUR FACE AND 
TRY TO INTIMIDATE YOU AND SCARE 
YOU. 
WE HAD A FEW EXPERIENCES HERE 
IN LOUISVILLE. 
I THINK THOSE WERE THE TWO 
THINGS THAT HELPED US SUCCEED. 
AND I THINK IT WAS AN IMPORTANT 
MOMENT FOR THE COUNTRY. 
I KNOW EVERYBODY DOESN'T SEE IT 
THE SAME WAY BUT THAT'S THE WAY 
I SEE IT. 
>> SENATOR, YOU SAID THAT SHE 
WAS CREDIBLE. 
THE PRESIDENT THOUGHT SHE WAS 
CREDIBLE. 
THEN THE PRESIDENT MOCKED DR. 
FORD ON ONE OF HIS SPEECHES. 
MANY SAY THAT SENDS A BAD 
MESSAGE FOR WOMEN ACROSS THE 
COUNTRY. 
>> I'M TRYING TO THINK OF HOW 
MANY TIMES YOU HAVE TRIED TO 
GET ME TO COMMENT ON 
PRESIDENTIAL COMMENTS. 
GOOD TRY. 
IN 2016 I BELIEVE YOU SAID WE 
WILL HOLD THIS OPEN BECAUSE 
IT'S A PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION 
YEAR, WE WILL LET THE PEOPLE 
DECIDE, GIVE THEM A CHANCE. 
NOW, AM I CORRECT IN SAYING 
THAT, WELL, SINCE WE HAVE A 
REPUBLICAN PRESIDENT AND 
REPUBLICAN SENATE WE COULD 
CONFIRM A NOMINEE IN 2020 -- 
>> I JUST WALKED YOU THROUGH 
THAT. 
I WILL GO THROUGH IT AGAIN. 
>> THE TRADITION GOING BACK TO 
THE 1880s HAS BEEN THAT IF A 
VACANCY OCCURS IN A 
PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION YEAR AND 
THERE IS A DIFFERENT PARTY IN 
CONTROL OF THE SENATE, THAN THE 
PRESIDENCY, IT IS NOT FILLED. 
I WALKED YOU THROUGH THAT A 
MINUTE AGO. 
SO, WE DON'T KNOW IF THERE WILL 
BE A VACANCY IN 2020. 
WE DON'T KNOW WHO WILL BE IN 
CHARGE OF THE SENATE. 
>> BUT THE KEY THERE IS THAT -- 
>> THAT HAS BEEN THE TRADITION 
GOING BACK TO THE 1880s AND DO 
I NEED TO QUOTE JOE BIDEN, 
CHUCK SCHUMER AGAIN? 
>> YOU THINK THAT IS FAIR? 
>> IT'S PRACTICAL. 
THINK ABOUT IT. 
THERE IS NO CHANCE THAT AN 
OPPOSITION PARTY IS GOING TO -- 
IN CONTROL OF THE SENATE WILL 
FILL A SUPREME COURT VACANCY 
INCURRING IN THE MIDDLE OF A 
PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION YEAR. 
THAT'S WHY IT HADN'T HAPPENED 
SINCE THE 1880s. 
I WILL TAKE ONE MORE. 
>> THE MOST CONSEQUENTIAL THING 
YOU HAVE BEEN INVOLVED IN. 
IS THIS YOUR GREATIST VICTORY 
YOUR TIME IN THE SENATE? 
>> I THINK OTHER PEOPLE HAVE TO 
MAKE THOSE KIND OF 
OBSERVATIONS. 
I THINK THE COURT PROJECT HAS 
BEEN MY NUMBER ONE PROJECT FOR 
THE LAST TWO YEARS, TWO SUPREME 
COURT JUSTICES, 26 CIRCUIT 
COURT JUSTIZE MY NUMBER ONE 
PRIORITY AND, SO, OBVIOUSLY I 
FEEL IT'S GOOD FOR THE COUNTRY, 
THE RIGHT THING TO DO AND I DO 
FEEL GOOD ABOUT IT. 
>> Reporter: DID YOU WATCH THE 
FOOTBALL GAME, SENATOR? 
LOUISVILLE -- 
>> OH, GOODNESS GRACIOUS. 
WE ARE OFF THE RECORD NOW, 
RIGHT? 
REMINDED ME OF RON COOPER, OH, 
NO. 
NOBODY IS FILMING RIGHT? 
>> THEY ARE STILL ROLLING. 
>> I WATCHED IT ON TV. 
I WAS STILL IN WASHINGTON. 
>> ALL RIGHT. 
YOU HAVE BEEN LISTENING TO 
SENATE MAJORITY LEADER MITCH 
McCONNELL TAKING QUESTIONS FROM 
LOCAL REPORTERS. 
THE QUESTION IS DIRECTED AT THE 
SPEAKER RANGED ON JUDGE 
KAVANAUGH ALTHOUGH YOU HEARD 
HIM JOKING WITH SOME OF THE 
REPORTS ABOUT FOOTBALL BUT 
QUESTIONS SURROUNDING JUDGE 
KAVANAUGH AND WHAT COULD 
POTENTIALLY HAPPEN IN 2020 
DURING A PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION 
YEAR DEPENDING ON WHICH PARTY 
IS IN CONTROL OF THE CONGRESS 
AND WHICH PARTY IS IN CONTROL 
OF THE PRESIDENCY. 
IN 2020, LEADING UP TO THE 
ELECTION THE REPUBLICAN 
PRESIDENT WILL BE IN CHARGE OF 
THE PRESIDENCY. 
IT WILL BE INTERESTING TO SEE 
WHAT HAPPENS IN THE UPCOMING 
MIDTERMS TO SEE WHERE WE END UP 
AT THE OTHER END OF THAT. 
MITCH McCONNELL SUGGESTING THAT 
REPUBLICANS ARE MORE GALVANIZED 
THAN EVER BECAUSE OF THE WAY 
THAT THEY FEEL, REPUBLICANS, 
THE MAJORITY LEADER FEEL THE 
WAY JUNG KAVANAUGH WAS TREATED. 
SO, HE SAYS THAT WHILE THERE IS 
A LOT OF ENTHUSIASM ON THE 
DEMOCRATIC SIDE HE BELIEVES 
THERE IS A LOT OF ENTHUSIASM 
GENERATED OVER THIS BATTLE OVER 
JUSTICE KAVANAUGH. 
WE WILL CONTINUE TO FOLLOW WHAT 
HAPPENS WITH THE SPEAKER AND 
WITH THE MAJORITY LEADER AND 
WITH PRESIDENT TRUMP WHO IS ON 
HIS WAY, AS WE SPEAK, TO 
FLORIDA. 
MEANWHILE, IN FLORIDA, THE 
NATIONAL HURRICANE CENTER SAYS 
TROPICAL STORM MICHAEL IS NOW A 
HURRICANE. 
FORECASTERS PREDICT THE STORM 
WILL STRENGTHEN AS IT MOVES 
INTO THE GULF OF MEXICO. 
IT IS EXPECTED TO MAKE LANDFALL 
BY MIDWEEK IN THE PANHANDLE OF 
FLORIDA OR BIG BEND. 
THE STATE'S GOVERNOR DECLARED A 
STATE OF EMERGENCY IN TWO DOZEN 
COUNTIES. 
NATIONAL GUARD SOLDIERS ARE ON 
ALERT.
