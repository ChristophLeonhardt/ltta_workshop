not the rule of law but the law of the strongest that was the damming assessment of French national security by the country's outgoing interior minister before his resignation earlier this week but some of the measures that have been tabled to improve the situation have ultimately been slammed by France's police force a Charla Dubinski investigates as Frances interior minister resigned this week he shone a spotlight on the state of the country security and it was stark I went to all these neighbourhoods the situation there is very bad it's time to restore the rule of law there because today it's rather the law of the strongest there the rule of narco-traffickers radical Islamists who have taken the place of the Republic France has been on a high terror alert since a wave of Islamist attacks in 2015 which killed more than a hundred and forty people and the atrocities kept coming in a bid to keep France safe 250,000 security personnel are deployed every day but forces say they're being stretched too thin and have reached a breaking point they've worked almost 22 million hours in overtime without any extra pay but MPs from macron zone party have a simple solution to the problem private security forces are a component which we must now take into account everyone recognizes that their NOAA key partner their report suggests guards in places like supermarkets and shops should essentially become another arm of the security services it suggests that they could all be equipped with Tasers have the right to carry concealed weapons and even get a distinct uniform police unions are furious secured Kupa it's privatizing security there's a real problem with the risk of private security agents being more of a risk to our citizens than an advantage right now few private security agents can carry firearms but that could also change up to 3,000 could be granted the right to carry guns and rifles a situation which could cause a small revolution in homeland security again making police unions uneasy there's a real risk for these agents not having enough training having a weapon in your hand means the possibility of taking a life it's out of the question and he says the changes could also lead to a clear divide between the protection available to those who can afford it and those who can't so could only force it all French people have an equal right to security we want the public service missions to effectively protect French people from the privatization of security because if it's privatized security will depend on the purchasing power the French to defend themselves and protect themselves also the officers are worried it will move France closer to the US model a country all too familiar with gun violence so far this year there have been more than 270 mass shootings in the u.s. mass shooting mass shooting in Florida another mass shooting in a year of mass shootings these shootings continued unabated people are dying that more people have been killed at schools this year that have been killed while serving in the military we're the mass shooting generation well France understandably wants to make tragedies on its streets a thing of the past police have slammed the new plans and say there's a far simpler solution just give better backup to existing officers who are accountable to the very people they're meant to protect you
