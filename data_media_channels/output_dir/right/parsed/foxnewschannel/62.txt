LOT OF QUESTIONS.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR DIGGING
IN.
IN A NEW OP-ED TONIGHT
"THE WALL STREET JOURNAL"
EDITORIAL BOARD AGREES AND SAID
THAT PRESIDENT TRUMP'S RIGHT TO
TURN BACK THE CARAVAN, PARTLY
BECAUSE IT'S ORGANIZED AND NOT
NECESSARILY TO THE BENEFIT OF
THE MIGRANTS.
PLUS, THERE'S THIS HISTORICAL
NOTE, "NOT SINCE THE 1980s
BOATLIFT FROM CUBA HAS THERE
BEEN A SIMILAR ATTEMPT TO
OVERWHELM U.S. IMMIGRATION LAW
ON THE PRETEXT OF CELEBRATING
AMERICAN FREEDOM."
IT GOES ON TO SAY THAT CASTRO
SOUGHT TO AT THE CRIMINALS AND
MENTALLY ILL ALSO CLIMBED ABOARD
THOSE BOATS.
NO ONE DOUBTED THE CUBAN HUNGER
TO ESCAPE THE UNINTENDED
CONSEQUENCES OF THE MAYHEM WERE
COSTLY.
TONIGHT'S POWER PANEL ON
IMMIGRATION, DEMOCRATIC
STRATEGIST DAVE BROWN.
FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR LISA BOOTHE
AND FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR, FORMER
ACTING AS DIRECTOR, THOMAS HOMAN
WELCOME TO ALL OF YOU.
I WANT TO START WITH SOMETHING
THAT NANCY PELOSI HAD TO SAY IN
A JOINT STATEMENT WITH
CHUCK SCHUMER.
SHE SAID THIS.
THE PRESIDENT IS DESPERATE TO
CHANGE THE SUBJECT FROM
HEALTH CARE TO IMMIGRATION
BECAUSE HE KNOWS THAT
HEALTH CARE IS THE NUMBER ONE
ISSUE AMERICANS CARE ABOUT.
LISA, YOUR RESPONSE?
>> I WOULD SAY THE DEMOCRATS ARE
DESPERATE TO NOT TALK ABOUT
IMMIGRATION.
THE CENTER FOR
AMERICAN PROGRESS, A LIBERAL
THINK TANK PUT OUT A MEMO TO
DEMOCRATS IN COMPETITIVE RACES T
DEMOCRATS IN COMPETITIVE RACES L
DEMOCRATS IN COMPETITIVE RACES E
DEMOCRATS IN COMPETITIVE RACES X
AND TO AVOID IMMIGRATION BECAUSE
REPUBLICANS HAVE BEEN ON THE
OFFENSE ON IMMIGRATION ON ISSUES
LIKE SANCTUARY CITIES, ON ISSUES
LIKE DEMOCRATS CALLS TO ABOLISH
ICE AND WHAT THIS DOES IS
PUTTING IMMIGRATION IN THE
CENTER AND THE FOCUS OF THE
NATIONAL DEBATE, WHICH IS
EXACTLY WHAT PRESIDENT TRUMP
WANTS, IT'S EXACTLY WHAT
REPUBLICANS WANT AND REPUBLICANS
AND PRESIDENT TRUMP SHOULD BE
OUT THERE HAMMERING IT BECAUSE
WHEN YOU SEE VISUALS LIKE THESE
MIGRANTS BREAKING DOWN THE GATES
INTO MEXICO IT JUST DEMONSTRATES
AND UNDERSCORES CALLS FOR
INCREASED BORDER SECURITY.
THEY COULDN'T ASK FOR A BETTER
POLITICAL GIFT TO BE HONEST.
>> Shannon: THIS IS WHAT
PRESIDENT TRUMP SAID, EVERY TIME
YOU SEE A CARAVAN OR PEOPLE
ILLEGALLY COMING OR ATTEMPTING
TO COME INTO OUR COUNTRY
ILLEGALLY, THINK OF AND BLAME
THE DEMOCRATS WERE NOT GIVING US
THE VOTES TO CHANGE OUR PATHETIC
IMMIGRATION LAWS.
OR MEMBER THE MIDTERMS, SO
UNFAIR TO THOSE WHO COME IN
LEGALLY, WHAT YOU MAKE OF THIS
ASSERTION THAT THIS IS A HUGE
POLITICAL GIFT TO THE PRESIDENT
AT JUST THE RIGHT TIME?
>> I AGREE THAT IT'S A POLITICAL
GIFT TO THE PRESIDENT BECAUSE
THIS IS A WEDGE ISSUE THAT HE'S
BEEN VERY EFFECTIVE AT USING
DATING ALL THE WAY BACK TO WHEN
HE RAN FOR PRESIDENT IN 2016.
BUT I DISAGREE, VERY MUCH
DISAGREE WITH THE FACT THE
DEMOCRATS HAVEN'T BEEN AT THE
TABLE AND TRYING TO WORK IN GOOD
FAITH.
I SERVED IN THE SENATE AS 2013
AS AN AIDE.
THAT YEAR WE PASSED
COMPREHENSIVE BIPARTISAN
IMMIGRATION REFORM.
DEMOCRATS AND REPUBLICANS CAME
TOGETHER.
THERE IS A PROVEN PATH.
THERE IS A WAY TO FIND A PATH
FORWARD FOR BIPARTISAN
IMMIGRATION REFORM.
IF ANYTHING I WAS REALLY STRUCK
AT THE FOX AND FRIENDS PANEL OF
INDEPENDENT VOTERS.
I THINK IT WAS THIS MORNING.
TO A PERSON, I DON'T WANT TO PUT
WORDS IN HER MOUTH BUT TO A
PERSON THEY RECOGNIZED THE
HUMANITARIAN CRISIS THAT'S AT
THE BORDER, THE PLIGHT OF THESE
PEOPLE BUT THEY ALSO SAID THEY
WANT DEMOCRATS AND REPUBLICANS
TO COME TOGETHER, THEY ARE TIRED
OF THE UNNECESSARY PARTISANSHIP
AND SO IS UNFORTUNATE THAT THE
PRESIDENT GET ENGAGES IN THE
KIND OF RHETORIC IS ENGAGING IN
WHERE HE ESSENTIALLY MAKES
IMMIGRATION REFORM A ZERO-SUM
GAME.
I DON'T THINK THAT'S BEST FOR
THE COUNTRY.
>> Shannon: HE PUT OUT HIS
FOUR PILLARS, GET THESE THINGS
DONE, INCLUDING GENEROUS
ALLOCATIONS FOR SO-CALLED
DREAMERS WHO ARE ALREADY HERE IN
THE COUNTRY AND OTHERS CONNECTED
TO THEM THAT HE WOULD SIGN THE
BILL.
REPUBLICANS COULDN'T GET IT
TOGETHER SO THAT HASN'T HAPPENE
HAPPENED.
NO ONE KNOWS BETTER ABOUT THAT
THAN FORMER ICE DIRECTOR THOMAS
HOMAN.
WE ARE GLAD TO HAVE YOU WITH US
TONIGHT.
I WANT TO PLAY SOMETHING THAT
PRESIDENT TRUMP SAID AT HIS
RALLY TONIGHT AND GET YOUR
REACTION, THOMAS.
>> THAT IS AN ASSAULT ON OUR
COUNTRY.
THAT'S AN ASSAULT.
AND IN THAT CARAVAN YOU HAVE
SOME VERY BAD PEOPLE, YOU HAVE
SOME VERY BAD PEOPLE, AND WE
CAN'T LET THAT HAPPEN TO OUR
COUNTRY.
>> Shannon: THOMAS, YOU WOULD
KNOW MORE ABOUT THIS PROBABLY
THAN THE REST OF US PUT TOGETHER
ABOUT EXACTLY WHO IS SHOWING UP
AT THE BORDER.
>> WE TAKE CUSTODY -- ICE TOOK
CUSTODY OF EVERYONE -- YOU LOOK
AT WHO THEY ARREST THE LAST FEW
YEARS BETWEEN 18 AND 20% HAVE A
CRIMINAL HISTORY.
THEY FED CRIMINAL CONVICTIONS.
THIS IS THE FIRST TIME THEY COME
TO THE UNITED STATES SO THERE
ARE A LOT OF CRIMINALS COMING
ACROSS THE BORDER.
I'M NOT SAYING EVERY CRIMINAL
BUT AS FAR AS WHAT THE
PRESIDENT, THE COMMENTS HE MADE,
WE HAVE EVERY RIGHT TO PROTECT
OUR BORDERS.
I'VE SEEN THE COVERAGE ALSO AND
SOMETIMES IT'S SAD TO SEE WHAT
YOU SEE BUT I CAN'T BLAME THESE
PEOPLE THAT WANT TO COME TO THE
UNITED STATES, WHERE THE
GREATEST COUNTRY ON EARTH BUT
YOU CAN'T BE A PART OF THE
GREATEST COUNTRY ON EARTH AND
NOT RESPECT ITS LAWS.
YOU CAN'T HAVE IT BOTH WAYS.
I AGREE 100%.
AS FAR AS THE SECOND SPEAKER,
YOU'RE SECOND-GUESSED TALK ABOUT
WORKING ON THE HILL AND
DEMOCRATS AT THE TABLE,
APPARENTLY HE WASN'T ON THE HILL
LAST YEAR BECAUSE I WAS THE ICE
DIRECTOR AND THEY WEREN'T AT THE
TABLE.
I MET A LOT OF LAWMAKERS UP
THERE, WE TRY TO SHUT DOWN THE
LOOPHOLES, THEY REFUSE TO SHUT
DOWN THE POLES.
WHEN I TALK ABOUT SANCTUARY
CITIES IN THE ABOLISHMENT OF
ICE, YOU WON'T LIVE FIXED
LOOPHOLES, YOU ARE ENTICING, YOU
ARE ENTICING OTHERS TO MAKE THAT
DANGEROUS JOURNEY AND IT'S JUST
NOT PEOPLE ENTERING THE COUNTRY
ILLEGALLY.
NATIONAL SECURITY ISSUE BECAUSE
THEY ARE RUNNING FAMILIES
THROUGH ONE SECTOR, THEY ARE
RUNNING DRUGS AND BAD PEOPLE
THROUGH ANOTHER SECTOR TO KEEP
MORE OF US TIED UP.
IT'S A FACT.
YOU CAN LIKE OR NOT LIKE THE
PRESIDENT, BUT HE'S 100%
ACCURATE ON THIS ISSUE.
>> Shannon: I WANT TO PLAY
SOMETHING THAT ONE OF THE
MEMBERS OF THIS CARAVAN TOLD US
TODAY.
THIS IS WHAT HE SAID ABOUT THE
STRATEGY.
>> THIS IS NOT GOING TO BE EASY.
A LOT OF PEOPLE.
I DON'T THINK HE'S GOING TO BE
ABLE TO STOP EVERYBODY.
>> Shannon: WHAT ABOUT THAT?
>> I THINK PRESIDENT TRUMP
SHOULD TRY BECAUSE WHAT WE HAVE
HERE ARE PEOPLE THAT ARE
INTENTIONALLY TRYING TO EXPLOIT
OUR LAWS AND THEY ARE DOING
THAT -- YOU LOOK AT LOOPHOLES IN
THE 2008 ANTIHUMAN TRAFFICKING
LAWS THAT MAKES IT VERY
DIFFICULT TO SEND CENTRAL
AMERICAN FAMILIES -- CENTRAL
AMERICAN INDIVIDUALS BACK.
YOU ALSO LOOK AT THINGS LIKE THE
FOREST DECREE WHICH BASICALLY
MEANS THAT MINORS CAN'T BE
DETAINED FOR LONGER THAN 20
DAYS, WHICH MAKES IT DIFFICULT
WHEN YOU HAVE THESE INDIVIDUALS
COMING OVER AS FAMILY UNITS.
SO THE CENTRAL AMERICAN MIGRANTS
KNOW WHAT THEY ARE DOING AND
THEY ARE INTENTIONALLY TRYING TO
EXPLOIT THE UNITED STATES LAWS
AND AS I MENTIONED BEFORE, WHEN
YOU SEE THE VISUAL OF THEM
BREAKING THROUGH THE GATE INTO
MEXICO, THIS JUST UNDERSCORES
PRESIDENT TRUMP'S CALLS FOR
BORDER SECURITY AND THIS IS
GOING TO DRIVE PEOPLE TO THE
POLLS, PARTICULARLY THE FACT
THAT IMMIGRATION IS THE NUMBER
ONE ISSUE FOR REPUBLICANS.
>> Shannon: I WANT TO MAKE
SURE WE GET DAVE AND THOMAS IN
HERE FOR A FINAL WORD.
DATE AND THEN ONTO THOMAS.
>> THIS IS A HEART ISSUE.
NO ONE WHO HAS WORKED ON THIS
ISSUE WOULD SAY IT'S AN EASY
ISSUE.
BOTTOM LINE, AND I THINK I'M
PROBABLY A BROKEN RECORD ON THIS
WITH YOU, SHANNON.
THIS IS AN ISSUE THAT REQUIRES
GOOD PEOPLE TO COME TOGETHER AND
COMPROMISE AND BE REASONABLE.
AND THE PROBLEM -- ONE OF YOUR
SPEAKERS TALKED ABOUT IT, HOW
DEMOCRATS WERE IN AT THE TABLE
IN THE HOUSE, THAT'S NOT TRUE, I
DISAGREE WITH THAT BUT PART OF
THE CHALLENGES VENDORS THAT
SPEAK OR WRITE IN HOUSE
REPUBLICANS LEADERSHIP HAVE
ALLOWED MEMBERS OF THEIR CAUCUS
TO DICTATE TERMS.
THERE'S ACTUALLY BROUGHT
BIPARTISAN CONSENSUS IN THIS
COUNTRY FOR IMMIGRATION REFORM.
SMART PEOPLE NEED TO COME TO THE
TABLE, THEY NEED TO COMPROMISE,
WE NEED TO FIND A WAY FORWARD.
>> Shannon: FINAL WERE TO YOU.
>> I WAS ON THE HILL AND I MET
WITH A LOT OF LAWMAKERS.
YOU CAN'T HAVE SOMEONE LIKE
NANCY PELOSI SAY I.C.E. AGENTS
ARE OUT TERRORIZING IMMIGRANT
COMMUNITIES.
YOU CAN HAVE PEOPLE LIKE
SENATOR GILLIBRAND TALK ABOUT
ABOLISHING ICE.
YOU CAN'T HAVE ALL THOSE LEADERS
ON THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY SAYING
THE THINGS THEY SAY AND ENTICING
FURTHER ILLEGAL ENTRY.
THIS ISN'T JUST ABOUT
LAW ENFORCEMENT.
THIS ISN'T JUST -- WHEN YOU
ENTICE PEOPLE TO MAKE THAT
JOURNEY PEOPLE WILL DIE ENTERING
THIS COUNTRY.
WOMEN WILL BE RAPED AND WE
ARE -- THE CRIMINAL ORGANIZATIO
ORGANIZATION, BANKROLLING A
CRIMINAL ORGANIZATION BY
ENTICING ILLEGAL ENTRY AND
HAVING OPEN BORDERS.
ABOLISHING ICE EQUALS OPEN
BORDERS.
NOT FIXING THE LOOPHOLES IN THE
LAW IS OPEN BORDERS.
EVERY PERSON ON THE HILL WHETHER
YOU ARE DEMOCRAT OR REPUBLICAN,
NUMBER ONE RESPONSIBILITY TO
