1
00:00:00,623 --> 00:00:08,096
LOOK HERE AT WHAT A KIM-TRUMP

2
00:00:08,096 --> 00:00:09,899
SUMMIT MIGHT LOOK LIKE.

3
00:00:09,899 --> 00:00:11,667
>> Reporter: THE UNCERTAINTY

4
00:00:11,667 --> 00:00:13,335
OF PLANNING A MEETING BETWEEN

5
00:00:13,335 --> 00:00:14,303
TWO UNPREDICTABLE USERS.

6
00:00:14,303 --> 00:00:17,173
>> IT MAY NOT HAPPEN QUICKLY, IT

7
00:00:17,173 --> 00:00:20,776
MAY HAPPEN LATER, BUT THE

8
00:00:20,776 --> 00:00:21,477
PRESIDENT IS READY.

9
00:00:21,477 --> 00:00:24,280
>> THEY ARE STILL TARGETING A

00:00:28,083 --> 00:00:28,884
KIM JONG UN.

13
00:00:28,884 --> 00:00:30,886
THEY ARE COORDINATING WITH THE

14
00:00:30,886 --> 00:00:31,654
U.S. ON PLANNING DESPITE THREATS

15
00:00:31,654 --> 00:00:34,089
TO CANCEL THE SUMMIT.

16
00:00:34,089 --> 00:00:35,090
U.S. AND NORTH KOREAN OFFICIALS

17
00:00:35,090 --> 00:00:37,927
WILL TRY TO AGREE ON HOW KIM

18
00:00:37,927 --> 00:00:39,628
SURRENDERS HIS NUCLEAR PROGRAM,

19
00:00:39,628 --> 00:00:40,930
WHAT NORTH KOREA RECEIVES IN

20
00:00:40,930 --> 00:00:42,898
RETURN AND WHEN IT WILL RECEIVE

21
00:00:42,898 --> 00:00:43,766
IT.

22
00:00:43,766 --> 00:00:44,934
A TOP STATE DEPARTMENT DIPLOMAT

23
00:00:44,934 --> 00:00:46,702
HAS JUST FLOATED A PLAN WHERE

24
00:00:46,702 --> 00:00:48,103
NORTH KOREA WOULD OFFER A BIG

25
00:00:48,103 --> 00:00:49,138
DOWN PAYMENT.

26
00:00:49,138 --> 00:00:52,274
ACCORDING TO SUSAN THORTON, THE

27
00:00:52,274 --> 00:00:53,709
ACTIVE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR

28
00:00:53,709 --> 00:00:54,910
EAST PACIFIC AFFAIRS, THE

29
00:00:54,910 --> 00:00:56,879
QUESTION IS, WHAT COULD BE

30
00:00:56,879 --> 00:00:57,880
FRONTLOADED IN THE PROCESS THAT

31
00:00:57,880 --> 00:00:59,748
IS INEVITABLY GOING ON FOR

32
00:00:59,748 --> 00:01:00,282
SOMETIME?

33
00:01:00,282 --> 00:01:02,484
AND WHAT WOULD BE ACCEPTABLE TO

34
00:01:02,484 --> 00:01:03,319
THE NORTH KOREAN SIDE IN

35
00:01:03,319 --> 00:01:07,590
RESPONSE TO THAT OFF-LOADING?

36
00:01:07,590 --> 00:01:11,327
THIS IS WHY I WILL DO ALL I CAN

37
00:01:11,327 --> 00:01:13,095
TO PREVENT SUSAN THORTON FROM

38
00:01:13,095 --> 00:01:14,964
BEING SECRETARY OF STATE.

39
00:01:14,964 --> 00:01:17,700
SHE'S IN TOKYO, UNDERMINING

40
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:20,302
POTUS BY ADVOCATING FOR PARTIAL

41
00:01:20,302 --> 00:01:21,103
NUKES IN NORTH KOREA.

42
00:01:21,103 --> 00:01:23,405
THE STATE DEPARTMENT SAYS

43
00:01:23,405 --> 00:01:26,542
THORNTON'S FULL COMMENTS MATCH

44
00:01:26,542 --> 00:01:27,710
SECRETARY OF STATE MIKE POMPEO'S

45
00:01:27,710 --> 00:01:28,077
POSITION.

46
00:01:28,077 --> 00:01:29,345
>> WHAT SUSAN THORTON IS TALKING

47
00:01:29,345 --> 00:01:31,113
ABOUT IS VERY SIMILAR AND THE

48
00:01:31,113 --> 00:01:32,414
SAME THING THAT SECRETARY POMPEO

49
00:01:32,414 --> 00:01:33,582
SPOKE ABOUT, AND THAT IS, WE

50
00:01:33,582 --> 00:01:36,752
WOULD LIKE TO SEE A BIGGER,

51
00:01:36,752 --> 00:01:38,287
BOLDER, DIFFERENT, FASTER DEAL

52
00:01:38,287 --> 00:01:40,522
THAN THE KIND OF DEALS THAT HAVE

53
00:01:40,522 --> 00:01:43,559
BEEN PROPOSED BEFORE.

54
00:01:43,559 --> 00:01:45,227
>> THE UNITED STATES WANTS AN

UPFRONT DEMONSTRATION, BEYOND

56
00:01:46,495 --> 00:01:47,563
PROMISES FROM KIM JONG UN THAT

57
00:01:47,563 --> 00:01:50,165
HE IS WILLING TO SURRENDER HIS

58
00:01:50,165 --> 00:01:51,901
NUCLEAR WEAPONS.

59
00:01:51,901 --> 00:01:53,469
THE SOUTH KOREAN GOVERNMENT,

60
