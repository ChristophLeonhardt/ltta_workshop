brand felt our was home to hundreds of people in the early hours it turned into a deadly inferno lots of people were just trapped they told us to stay in and they're coming to get us when I saw the children and they were screaming for help and then their room went up in fire and I just saw Birds alive and there's nothing left of them there's nothing left to tell us that don't lie to us in my 29 years of being a firefighter I have never ever seen anything of this scale adding and that was reported is also not in accordance with UK building regulation this is the biggest tragedy in British history since the war but it's not being treated like that they actually just don't care most of the community have come to conclusion that they don't I believe social murders occurred in this instance help them there was no one in charge and there was nobody willing to accept responsibility we are ensuring that support is put in place for people what austerity really means and what poverty really means in Britain look at the disaster of Granville Tower time action retention you're watching a special edition of going underground on the eve of the one-year anniversary of Britain's worst ever tower block fire we're in front of the Grenfell tower but instead of social murder what is on the Grenfell tower today is the phrase forever in our hearts coming up in the show why was the Grenfell tower atrocity seen as emblematic of post-2008 crash austerity Britain we talk to those helping the poorest community in one of the richest areas on earth first up is the organizer of the silent marches which have commemorated the dead on the 14th of every month he grew up in Kensington and Chelsea the so called royal borough and his name is aired Craig said how powerful do you believe these silent marches that have been happening every month of been and when it comes to galvanizing consciousness in this area let alone around Britain in the world I mean the numbers of kind of explain that showed us what it's doing to this community and when it's doing to communities surrounding the area as well I mean to start from the first walk of about fifty people to move on to a few thousands by the six-month anniversary just goes to show it's it's keeping it relevant and it's giving people an option to to be counted in to come and be united and stand with the communities had such a tough year and I understand that you'd learn from previous uprisings in Tottenham and other places in Britain that they had to be peaceful marches because otherwise people might start to attack the community in the breasts exactly because you look here in the early days of what happened after the tower and you look at the reaction outside the first protest at the town hall and that went viral the reaction to people trying to storm the Town Hall was big news we didn't really get much news coverage into about the six-month anniversary for the sign of water it just goes to show how quick bad news travels and if we reacted in there or then escalated that protest at the town hall into something greater into something more catastrophic or violent then that's the news that the rest of the world will see and we need to make sure that the message is being shown to what's actually happening here at the moment and we're not violent we have we have the capability to to be you know angry and to come together in in times of need there's a flipside to that though isn't there the reason perhaps they didn't cover you for six months is because a silent March is not news as considered by as it is hidden in the media and in fact if there had been more of more flames as it were then the media would have covered it and people we're always going to sympathize with this community my question to you and that would then be why is it not news to to the media outlets why is the gathering of a community who suffered the biggest trauma or the biggest tragedy in British history since the war why is the gathering and the growth of a community and the morning of the community and the fact that different organizations and different groups are coming together as one that's my question I'd much rather see something uplifting about what's happening around the world then necessarily just what what's deemed as popular news which is violence and tragedy take us back a year to when you were walking around here it's your community you had expectations that there'd be some sort of relief centre and there was a relief centre you were a bit shocked that everyone was just told to go home at sunset it was um it was very disappointing in a time what on the night of Graham throw itself I mean the tragedy like that couldn't have been planned for so I can understand the difficulties in in putting an emergency plan into place but when I say the community were left to pick up all the pieces for at least four to five solid days before any form of official organization started filtering down towards us you'd have to be here to believe that I suppose I've tried to explain to people before and you know we live in in England one of the most richest countries in the world and people can't seem to understand the fact or to believe the fact that a community was left to pick up the tragedy to themselves and that's the case that's what happened we have one road that separates social housing to multi-million pound homes now when I expressed the fact that I live in this part of London I tend to get the most common answer or the most common response with me I was lucky man you must be a millionaire or you're a lucky man and to be honest I think people don't understand the difficulty of growing up in an area where money isn't of immediate option however 30 seconds down the road we have multimillion-pound homes and that confusion growing up is is a big factor but also that confusion I think has blessed the poorer people of this community myself and and the others to kind of appreciate what we have the last years really showed me I've always known that what this community is capable of and I've always been proud to live here amongst my neighbors but to see how we've carried ourselves and we've supported each other over the last 12 months is is incredible and I just hope it continues the Prime Minister didn't meet the survivors she came under big criticism at the time for that in the immediate aftermath I don't know what the community thought about that do they care if the Prime Minister came or not yeah I mean most definitely not because of who she is as a person but as the Prime Minister the person who runs this country that support that that need that compassion that empathy was very much needed and it was non-existent she now says in the past 48 hours she says she regrets not meeting survivors it seemed as though I didn't care but that was never the case there's there's your apology I suppose what do you think about the fact that her a chief of staff her adviser is the former housing minister who's alleged to have sat on the fire safety reports on previous tower block fires I mean look this just sums up the state we're living in at the moment and it's a reaction because we're talking about about these points and these apologies that have come out look the truth is we were a year on to the anniversary so everyone wants a story now everybody wants a story everybody wants to hear what our community feels about the government or the prime minister or the council like I said for for myself and for this community the last 12 months have been the difficult time I can't dwell we can't dwell on what had happened or how someone had felt emotionally or how someone had reacted to it it's about going forward and making sure that these things don't happen again and that answers are made and people are held accountable for the tragedies that had happened is it thousands of people have needed mental health treatment since that since that fire some people believe that actually organizers not sure those like you are D politicizing what is in fact something very very at its core about politics of the rich and poor in this country how would you answer that I mean the biggest answer is everything's about politics unfortunately whether it's Grantha or whether it's school fees or whether it's society and social housing I mean everything stems from politics so in a time like this it's it's very hard and very draining if we focus all our attention on the political struggle we need justice and we need to make money or marches they shout no justice no peace actually we only chant for Justice actually well I've been on the marches and I've definitely had no justice no peace as well and it doesn't say forever in our hearts that that's not what people are talking about people there people are angry these people you can sense the anger on your marches is there a danger that there is a sort of corporatization of the tragedy and the reaction to the trance I don't agree and even that question I'd rather you move on to another question because you're you're mentioning we're on camera and you're mentioning now that the marches there are people angry now I'm telling you there are people suffering with trauma there are people who've experienced and gone through experiences and lost friends and lost family and lost neighbors mums don't daughters sons and then you want to fix on the point that people while walking angry now in the silent walk has there been any violence and just in general players we have to be very careful when the words we use using the word angry of course there were people that are angry but show me where that has filtered into the silent marches you're making an assumption based on someone's facial expression I think anyone would say there's a dignity in those well exactly the silent walk itself has remained silent from the first one to the last one so for you to be able to tell me that people are angry without hearing the voices of people during the silent March means your basic nap on the on the way people look or on body language laughing I have talked as well I mean the shadow chancellor of the exchequer john mcdonald he called this an act of social murder now in in just what a mainstream political party said you can sense anger on labor benches the same with many of the other parties and did some backbench conservatives who know it's that anger I mean naturally like I said we've with the disaster as big as what happened here naturally there's going to be anger again like I said for the last year we've carried us off in a way where we allow our anger to filter in to each other in which you know we carry each other's burdens we carry through some other stresses and traumas and I can't explain to you and I get defensive when we talk about the community so apologies if I'm if I'm coming across quite defensive but like I said I've I've seen people come together in ways that can never experienced or never explained and hopefully never have to go through again and again the questions of politics and the questions of the Labour Party being outraged and conservatives potentially being outraged and like I said the community want justice we want people to be held accountable and in the long term whether your labor or whether you're conservative we want to make sure that there's things and measures put in place to make sure people are safe in their homes we don't want people to ever have to go through what we've gone through because what we've gone through will last with us forever and talking on the number of people suffering with mental health I mean the thousands is not a random random number from children 512 hundreds of children according to the children kids who've gone into school and no longer have friends sitting in the class with them now I'm a 13 year old man and I have nightmares I've suffered trauma I find it difficult to talk or to open up sometimes to two people and as a 30 year old man if I'm feeling like this then what are our kids feeling like what are our elderly feeling like in the area it's the the sad truth of sad reality of of what's going on and I just have to keep focusing on giving this community something to be proud of and making sure that those lives weren't lost for for no reason if you show that we can make change in that you know like I said these things never happen again and will the marchers just go on and do you expect justice they'll continue I mean the March is it would be a shame to stop them not just for the call for justice but the therapy it brings there's people you won't see for most of the month until the 14th and you know us holding the walk on the actual 14th of the month subconsciously is helping a lot of people because it gives someone an event it gives someone a place together it gives someone a community to be around rather than you know if we didn't have the silent walk happening on the 14th of them every month on potentially have a lot of people sitting at home depressed or you know alone suffering with depression and I think that's that's the most worrying the most scary factor about about this and just making sure that people have the option to come together and all the welcome on Thursday and future March of course no matter what skin tone what race what belief you are what political party you represent as long as you come as a human being and you drop everything on arrival and you respect the silence we welcome everybody from all faiths and wages to come and join us there Greg thank you after the break Scotland Yard instead of investigating the socio-economic sparks that may have led to the Grenfell atrocity are now investigating those who risked their lives to save the fallen we talk to the emergency services that's coming up in part two of this special edition of going underground welcome back you're watching a special edition of going underground on the eve of the one-year anniversary of the worst tower fire in British history the grenfell fire I'm joined now by the London regional official of the Fire Brigades Union Lucy Mercer Lucy thanks for coming on the show before actually we get to the Grenfell Tower 5000 jobs gone 1300 dead in the fire blazes over that six years and a 25% cut from central government what is the state of Fire Brigades Union and the Fire Brigades one year since grandfa well we are in a worrying situation my Union the fire brigade Union have been saying this you know for a long time for the last three years our former mayor now foreign secretary Boris Johnson imposed major cuts on the fire service three to four years ago that include included 29 fire engines being removed from front-line service over a thousand job losses in London alone and 10 fire stations in London closed down including ones very close to Grenfell Tower now my union warned at the time that these cuts not only in London but across the country would lead to an increase an increase in fire deaths and unfortunately what we've seen in the year 2016 to 2017 even before grenfell we've seen a 30% rise in fire deaths in this country your officials have been on this program actually warning all that but more than 70 people died over there a year ago tomorrow the news is here that Scotland Yard are going to be investigating the fire brigades and your members what was your reaction when you heard that news I mean what they're investigating is a stay-put policy the stay-put policy is not the London the fire brigade unions policy that's the London Fire Brigades you'd really have to speak to them about that what I can say about my members my members who attended that fire on the 14th of June last year is they put their lives on the line those brave men and women who went into that building who are absolutely devastated to this day about what happened and to have people go on TV and and to talk about what they could have done or what they should have done is really not helpful I know fault any one of those firefighters who went into that building their work was absolutely astonishing and amazing and had it not been for the actions of those firefighters on that night many more people would have died you see I mean there's lots of reports about failures of your members surprised that there may be more emphasis on that than the companies involved in say the engineering of that building and the development of that building I do find it very concerning and very upsetting that there seems to be a narrative now especially from the right-wing media to try and shift the blame onto the fire brigade on to the firefighters what we should be doing is looking at a system that for decades has cut funding to the fire service has deregulated fire regulations you know a system over decades where we really haven't looked after people in social housing that's I believe what caused the incident on the 14th of June last year not the actions of the firefighters the firefighters who went into that building and nothing more than heroes and anyone who says anything else really and not you know not good enough to lace our boots I speak to my members who went into that fire many of them are my friends you should understand I'm based at Chelsea fire station not not far from here and my station were one of the first on the scene so these are my friends I talked to they're absolutely heartbroken about what happened they literally were having to make the choice between who they were going to save and who they had to leave behind the control workers who had to listen to people die on the other end of the phone you know these people did an amazing job there's an inquiry going on at the end of this inquiry we may get some answers we need to listen to the evidence we need to find out from the people on the scene from the victims from the firefighters from the emergency services what took place for people to come out and make these accurate accusations is really unhelpful is it going too far to say that elites are basically blaming your members instead of austerity which has been the excuse the usual the usual accusation by your members as to why they aren't as able as they might be to put out fires and I think it's to be expected you know anything of this magnitude where the government is you know put under focused where Stara tea is looked at where cuts to the fire service deregulation of fire safety when those things are put under microscope of course people are going to come out and try and push for a different narrative and unfortunately you know if that narrative involves putting the blame on the people who really the only people who went in there and save lives then there's not much we can do about that I think the public won't be fooled though the public knows exactly what went on on that night and the survivors the relatives of the victims they know the work that those brave men and women did on that night you know as they were running away from the danger we were running in and I don't think anyone can question the actions of those firefighters or maybe that confident though I mean obviously to resume was elected as Minority Leader in the in the British government after it and she said only the other day for those who thought she should have maybe met survivors in the aftermath of the fire it seemed as though I didn't care but that wasn't the case and she regrets it I mean to be honest what the treasom a came down and and and and met the firefighters and staged a photo what that's that's not important you know what's important to us is justice just justice for every one of those seventy-two men women and children who burned in the building not too far behind me that's what is important you know Teresa may standing in front of a camera whether she smiles or not it's irrelevant the victims don't care about that we want justice we want this inquiry to deliver loss justice we want the questions that we have to be answered and like I say ultimately we just need justice if those victims do not get justice for what happened on the 14th of June 2017 there's going to be anger there's already anger at the moment but people are keeping it contained you know it's it's you can feel it just walking around this area I mean I'm on site you know at least once a week almost every other day I'm on site here and you walk around and there's this feeling in the community it's it's bubbling away there under the surface and everyone's having hope for this inquiry so this inquiry has to the deliver those answers it has to give justice to those 72 people and if it doesn't I think there's to be a lot of anger using wizzard thank you thank you now to the so called forth emergency service on that night in Kensington and Chelsea I'm joined by Alan Everett he's the vicar of st. Clements a church in the shadow of the Grenfell tower he's also the author of after the fire finding words for grant fell millions of words will be found arguably at the inquiry that Teresa may has launched what's your sense of what the community feel about what their expectations of the millions of words they'll be written about that night I think most people appreciate the need to document and to highlight the issues I think the frustration and difficulty for people is simply the time it's going to take before we get results and so people are in this situation where they feel very helpless where they're just waiting and here we are a year on and we're still waiting the inquiry has an effect only really just begun Granville Tower has recently been covered but it's still up there we've no clear formal process for carrying forward the next stage with the tower it's demolition will be dirty and noisy we don't know what's going to be put in its place as a memorial site so the whole is a year old and none of these things know exactly and then obviously there are still outstanding issues to do with housing so people are in a state of waiting abeyance and they feel powerless and helpless and we're now in the middle of the anniversary week and it's just that sense of we are on a long journey when is it going to end I mean one of the assistant priests in your church st. Clements Robert Thompson said those on the lowest incomes do you not feel listened to for years by those in power in the context of grenfell is that a feeling that is echoed by your parishioners well I think he all have been speaking about the performance of the tenant management organization for many years when I first arrived in the parish from 2010 those issues were alive including the issue of fire safety including the issue of emergency access of fire engines the base of the tower were the developments that took place around there so yes these are issues which have been outstanding for very very many years I think the arms-length approach which the borough adopted working through the TMO had very negative implications for people who live on the estates and they felt they had a very poor level of service and so people definitely did feel neglected and this is you know no matter what shade of people's political beliefs how politically active they were pretty much everybody felt very very disgruntled and frustrated by the performance of the TMO and so one of the things that yes a tent measurement organization so one of the one of the natural consequences was that for some people a narrative has emerged that this was a deliberate policy to run down the estate's to pave the way for regeneration to change the character of the area I suppose the inquiries meant to deal with those things but it is quite interesting how people from all faiths helped on the night were saviors that night I in some might have been surprised certainly those in the government when the archbishop the head of the Anglican Church Justin Welby said in the same breath almost he talked about Grenville and then about corporations nor paying tax how much is this sense of that this is not just about Granville this is about a sense of inequality through out the country it's definitely the case that people in this northern tip of the raw Borough of Kensington Chelsea feel marginalized marginal to the life of the borough the main issue at the heart of all this I think really is housing and that is clearly an absolutely huge issue but I think the bigger problem was that North Kensington was really not known about before the fire if you'd have said Kensington to people they would automatically have assumed that the entire borough was extremely wealthy and this was just a forgotten corner and I think that's been the basic problem underlying everything do you think that some some critics who said the story of Grenfell could really be a story of generation people talking about social cleansing gentrification is that an element in the story of grandfa there were fears of that the states were going to be regenerated and that would include a good thing well reg regeneration evoke the specter I think of private housing coming into spaces previously designated for social housing so I think there were very very strong concerns about that my understanding is that all those plans have been put on hold and the head of the Anglican Church actually that's probably the Queen does the archbishop did Archbishop well we consult to you when he said and some people might have been shocked by this said the inadequate response to the grenfell fire was ultimately a failure of values what did you what do you think he made meant by that I don't know whether he'd talk to you about saying if he didn't talk to me about that I did see the Archbishop of Canterbury at st. Clements Church music after the fire he didn't talk to me I think for me if we're talking about failure of values we're talking about the fact that people living in poor areas people living in social housing are taken for granted people were told that shoddy repairs shoddy work to the building they should be grateful for what they'd been given because they didn't own the property and I think that attitude that people should be grateful for what they've got even though it was shoddy even though it was probably dangerous I think that is a failure of value I think that's a failure of compassion I think that's treating people different people however thank you that's it for this special edition of going underground we're back on Saturday though to fathom what the Singapore summit all meant for the future of the world till then keep in touch with us via social media we'll see on Saturday when British workers mark the bat of all grieve now Ceylon is a seminal fight to social democracy against the Thatcherite forces of neoliberalism
