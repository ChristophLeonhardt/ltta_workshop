1
00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:02,640
Just hours before his
State of the Union address

2
00:00:02,640 --> 00:00:03,640
on Tuesday —

3
00:00:03,640 --> 00:00:07,490
“North Korea’s reckless pursuit
of nuclear missiles

4
00:00:07,490 --> 00:00:10,620
could very soon
threaten our homeland.”

5
00:00:10,620 --> 00:00:12,920
— President Trump’s administration
dropped its plan

6
00:00:12,920 --> 00:00:14,380
to nominate Victor D. Cha

7
00:00:14,380 --> 00:00:16,530
for the ambassador
to South Korea.

8
00:00:16,530 --> 00:00:19,290
Cha had a fallout with the
administration over a plan

9
00:00:19,290 --> 00:00:21,440
to carry out a preventive
military strike

10
00:00:21,440 --> 00:00:22,650
against North Korea.

11
00:00:22,650 --> 00:00:25,170
He’s against what he called
a “bloody nose” strategy

12
00:00:25,170 --> 00:00:28,140
in a Washington Post op-ed.

13
00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:31,390
He argues the administration
is pushing for it.

14
00:00:31,390 --> 00:00:34,500
As part of a reoccurring
annual military exercise,

15
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:36,840
the U.S. and South
Korea conducted drills

16
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:39,480
that simulated strikes on North
Korean nuclear

17
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:41,020
and missile testing sites.

18
00:00:41,020 --> 00:00:42,870
And the
U.S. military itself

19
00:00:42,870 --> 00:00:45,030
has been quietly prepping
for a last resort

20
00:00:45,030 --> 00:00:46,770
war with North Korea.

21
00:00:46,770 --> 00:00:49,080
The idea behind the
bloody-nose strategy

22
00:00:49,080 --> 00:00:51,780
is to use military force
against North Korea,

23
00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:53,610
but not so destructive
that it would

24
00:00:53,610 --> 00:00:56,280
trigger a retaliatory strike.

25
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:59,100
The most obvious target
would be a nuclear site,

26
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:01,200
but many of North Korea’s
missile-building sites

27
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:04,019
are unknown and others are
buried too deep underground

28
00:01:04,019 --> 00:01:05,250
to reach.

29
00:01:05,250 --> 00:01:08,070
Proponents argue that
an early limited strike

30
00:01:08,070 --> 00:01:10,530
could make North Korea
think twice about continuing

31
00:01:10,530 --> 00:01:12,180
its nuclear program.

32
00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:15,240
On the other hand, it could
be that floating an airstrike

33
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:17,270
combined with
saber-rattling rhetoric

34
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:21,600
is just an elaborate
psychological operation

35
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:24,090
designed to get inside
Kim Jong-un’s head.

36
00:01:24,090 --> 00:01:26,100
But Cha and other
experts have previously

37
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:29,280
contended that a military
confrontation is ill advised.

38
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:32,410
“This is not firing
59 Tomahawk missiles

39
00:01:32,410 --> 00:01:35,910
at an air base in Syria,
or dropping a bomb

40
00:01:35,910 --> 00:01:39,150
on a set of bunkers
in Afghanistan.

41
00:01:39,150 --> 00:01:44,820
This would be — this would be a
conflict like we have not seen.”

42
00:01:44,820 --> 00:01:47,130
His fear is that a
bloody nose could quickly

43
00:01:47,130 --> 00:00:00,000
turn into a full-blown war.
