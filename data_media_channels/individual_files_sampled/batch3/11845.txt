now to pharmacy chains in the German city of Frankfurt who have been labeled racist a municipal union representing foreigners says that their centuries-old name offends migrants from Africa as they contain the word more Arty's Peter Oliver reports what is in a name well for Frankfurt Council the name of two of the city's pharmacies was enough to demand that they be changed this is one of them the zeal Aperta codes are morin and it's that final part of the name that the City Council here in Frankfurt have a problem with it translates as the Moorish pharmacy now traditionally what that meant is that this was a pharmacy that would have stocked alternative medicines or medicines from the east as well as Western medicine this building here you can see originates from 1900 however there are campaigners that say that this type of name has no place in modern Germany the reason for the complaint was that people said this using the term Moorish was racist and offensive against people from North Africa we spoke to people here on the streets of Frankfurt engaged their opinion about the proposed name change I think it's a shame because it's part of maybe our culture too and it it doesn't have any more to do with maybe with origin we shouldn't change our traditions for me if something is to be racist it has to either diminish or belittle people in this case it has more to do with recognizing cultural heritage it didn't even appear to me that you know it's offensive because it is a historic it's simply a historic term and and the pharmacy doesn't for sure it doesn't use it to be to be offensive the owners of both pharmacies politely declined to appear on camera saying that being used that they were going to be forced to change their name that brought nothing but unwanted publicity interestingly enough the name a Patek heads or mourn is much more commonplace in the state of North rhine-westphalia but the integration council in that state were asked if they'd be following Frankfurt's example where they said no they had far better things to be doing Peter Oliver Artie Frankfort
