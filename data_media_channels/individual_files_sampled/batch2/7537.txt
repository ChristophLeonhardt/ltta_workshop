WE ARE ABOUT TO DO A GREAT STORY ON LARRY FLYNT, BUT WE MADE THAT GRAPHIC ANYWAY. THAT IS LARRY FLYNT IN THERE AND I HATE TO COMPARE HIM TO DOG THE BOUNTY HUNTER BUT HE'S PUT A BOUNTY ON INFORMATION ABOUT DONALD TRUMP AND THAT I LOVE. HE'S AN AMERICAN HERO, HE OFFERS FREEDOM OF SPEECH AND FREEDOM OF THE PRESS AND HE HAS DONE SOME GREAT SERVICE BEFORE IN GOING AFTER HYPOCRITICAL POLITICIANS. I'LL TELL YOU ABOUT THAT IN A SECOND. NOW HE IS GOING AFTER DONALD TRUMP. SO HE HAS PUT OUT A $10 MILLION BOUNTY FOR INFORMATION LEADING TO THE IMPEACHMENT AND REMOVAL FROM OFFICE OF DONALD TRUMP. SO HE PUT OUT A TIP LINE BOTH ON THE PHONE AND ONLINE. IF YOU KNOW ANY INFORMATION THAT COULD LEAD TO THE IMPEACHMENT OF DONALD TRUMP AND HE IS LIKELY, HIS BILLIONAIRE FRIENDS PROBABLY WON'T DO IT. BY THE WAY, THIS IS THE EMAIL. HE SAID HIS BILLIONAIRE CRONY CAPITALIST FRIENDS PROBABLY WON'T BUT THERE'S GOTTA BE SOMEBODY IN TRUMP UNIVERSITY WHO COULD USE $10 MILLION AND THEY HAVE NO PRINCIPLES OR CONSCIOUS ANYWAY. THEY WENT AND CIRCLED THEIR WAGONS AROUND DONALD TRUMP. THOSE ARE NOT PEOPLE WITH A DEEP DEGREE OF PRINCIPLE. THEY ARE IN IT FOR THE MONEY AND IN FACT, FLYNT SAYS: HE IS NOT KIDDING. HE IS A MAN OF HIS WORD SO IF YOU ARE ONE OF THOSE MORALISTS WHO SAY HUSTLER MAGAZINE, THAT HAS DIRTY PICTURES OF PEOPLE DOING REALLY FUN THINGS. OKAY, THEN GO AWAY. ENJOY YOUR MORALISM AND JUDGMENT OF OTHER PEOPLE IN A CORNER. BUT LARRY FLYNT IS NOT HAVING ANY OF THAT. HE IS ACTUALLY PUTTING HIS MONEY WHERE HIS MOUTH IS, SAYING THIS GUY'S A DANGER TO THE WORLD AND I'M GOING TO DO MY BEST TO GET HIM OUT. HE HAS DONE THIS BEFORE AND IT HAS WORKED BEFORE. FIRST HE OFFERED A MILLION-DOLLAR BOUNTY ABOUT MITT ROMNEY'S UNRELEASED TAX RETURNS AT THE TIME OR ANY DETAILS ON HIS OFF SHORE ASSETS OR BUSINESS PARTNERSHIPS. AS IT TURNED OUT, ROMNEY WOUND UP RELEASING HIS TAX RETURNS UNLIKE DONALD TRUMP. I DON'T KNOW IF IT WAS PARTLY DUE TO THE PRESSURE LARRY FLYNT PUT ON BUT THERE'S ANOTHER INSTANCE WHERE HE ABSOLUTELY DELIVERED. HE PUT ON A $1 MILLION BOUNTY BACK IN THE LATE 1990S SAYING: HE DID THAT BECAUSE HE WAS DISGUSTED WITH THE HYPOCRISY OF THE REPUBLICANS WHO WERE GOING AFTER BILL CLINTON AT THE TIME FOR IMPEACHMENT BASED ON SEX CHARGES AND HE SAID LOOK, HE LIED ABOUT SEX. EVERYBODY DOES, ESPECIALLY IF THEY ARE MARRIED. AND YOU COULD AGREE OR DISAGREE WITH HIM BUT HE SAID, THESE MORAL HYPOCRITES THAT ARE PROSECUTING HIM AND PRETENDING TO BE FOR FAMILY VALUES, HE SAID I CAN'T WAIT TO BUST THEM AND HE DID. NEWT GINGRICH ,WHO BY THE WAY WAS ALSO HAVING AN AFFAIR THE SAME TIME AS HE WAS TRYING TO PROSECUTE BILL CLINTON, WAS STEPPING DOWN SO THE NEXT SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE WAS GOING TO BE BOB LIVINGSTON, A REPUBLICAN FROM LOUISIANA AND LARRY FLYNT GOT HIM. HE GOT INFORMATION ABOUT HIS AFFAIRS AND HE WAS GOING TO PUBLISH IT. ROB LIVINGSTON PREEMPTED IT BY IMMEDIATELY RESIGNING. BOB LIVINGSTON AND NEWT GINGRICH WERE HYPOCRITES. LIVINGSTON AT LEAST HAD THE DECENCY TO CRAWL INTO A CAVE AND NOT BOTHER US ANYMORE. HIS WIFE EVENTUALLY BEGGED LARRY FLYNT NOT TO PUT UP ACTUAL INFORMATION AND HE DID NOT PUT OUT THE CD DETAILS BECAUSE HE IS A DECENT GUY. THE WHOLE POINT WAS TO BE THERE' AND IT WAS MISSION ACCOMPLISHED. HE DID PAY THE AMOUNT. SO WHEN HE SAYS HE IS GOING TO PAY $10 MILLION, IF HISTORY IS ANY GUIDE, HE WILL BUT IT HAS TO BE REAL INFORMATION AND IT HAS TO LEAD TO DONALD TRUMP'S IMPEACHMENT AND I HOPE TO GOD HE IS SUCCESSFUL BECAUSE AS I HAVE SAID 1000 TIMES ON THE SHOW, DONALD TRUMP IS A DANGER TO THE REPUBLIC, TO THE CONSTITUTION, TO THE COUNTRY, INTO THE WORLD WHETHER IT'S THE 25TH AMENDMENT IMPEACHMENT OR CHARGES BASED ON HIS DEALINGS WITH RUSSIA, I'M HAPPY TO GET HIM OUT OF OFFICE IMMEDIATELY. LARRY FLYNT IRONICALLY, ONCE AGAIN, DOING GOD'S WORK.
