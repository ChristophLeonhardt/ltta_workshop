1
00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:02,178
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

2
00:00:02,179 --> 00:00:03,646
REPUBLICANS ARE LOOKING TO

3
00:00:03,647 --> 00:00:05,381
KEEP THEIR MAJORITIES DESPITE

4
00:00:05,382 --> 00:00:06,682
THE POLLS SHOWING THEM UNDER

5
00:00:06,683 --> 00:00:08,117
WATER WITH THE FEMALE LIKELY

6
00:00:08,118 --> 00:00:08,751
VOTERS.

7
00:00:08,752 --> 00:00:09,785
HEADLINES LIKE THIS FROM THE

8
00:00:09,786 --> 00:00:11,253
"ASSOCIATED PRESS" AIMED AT

9
00:00:11,254 --> 00:00:13,656
THE PRESIDENT.

10
00:00:13,657 --> 00:00:14,056
"HORSEFACE."

11
00:00:14,057 --> 00:00:16,392
DOES IT MATTER WHAT TRUMP

12
00:00:16,393 --> 00:00:17,660
RIDICULES WOMEN?

13
00:00:17,661 --> 00:00:19,295
LAURA TRUMP IS CAMPAIGNING FOR

14
00:00:19,296 --> 00:00:20,796
TRUMP AND THERE ARE A LOT OF

15
00:00:20,797 --> 00:00:21,363
OTHER RACES.

16
00:00:21,364 --> 00:00:22,698
THANK YOU FOR TAKING THE TIME

17
00:00:22,699 --> 00:00:23,666
TO VISIT WITH US.

18
00:00:23,667 --> 00:00:24,800
LET'S TALK ABOUT THIS.

19
00:00:24,801 --> 00:00:26,101
THE PRESIDENT GOT A LOT OF

20
00:00:26,102 --> 00:00:27,203
ATTENTION FOR THE BACK AND

21
00:00:27,204 --> 00:00:28,671
FORTH FOR STORMY DANIELS THIS

22
00:00:28,672 --> 00:00:29,038
WEEK.

23
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:29,772
THE "WASHINGTON POST" SAYS

24
00:00:29,773 --> 00:00:31,607
DESPITE THE MULTIPLE POLLS

25
00:00:31,608 --> 00:00:32,808
SHOWS THAT THE G.O.P. IS DOING

26
00:00:32,809 --> 00:00:34,109
POORLY WITH THE WOMEN OVERALL

27
00:00:34,110 --> 00:00:35,511
AND THE PARTY IS LOSING SOME

28
00:00:35,512 --> 00:00:36,946
OF THE FEMALE VOTERS WHO

29
00:00:36,947 --> 00:00:38,514
SUPPORTED TRUMP IN 2016, THE

30
00:00:38,515 --> 00:00:40,149
PRESIDENT CONTINUED TO SAY

31
00:00:40,150 --> 00:00:41,517
THINGS THAT MANY PREDICT WILL

32
00:00:41,518 --> 00:00:42,852
KEEP THE WOMEN VOTING FOR

33
00:00:42,853 --> 00:00:43,853
REPUBLICANS IN THE NOVEMBER

34
00:00:43,854 --> 00:00:44,553
MIDTERM ELECTION.

35
00:00:44,554 --> 00:00:47,122
HOW DO YOU RESPOND TO THAT

36
00:00:47,123 --> 00:00:47,523
CONCERN?

37
00:00:47,524 --> 00:00:48,524
>> I WAS IN NORTH CAROLINA

38
00:00:48,525 --> 00:00:48,891
YESTERDAY.

39
00:00:48,892 --> 00:00:50,159
AND THE NUMBER OF WOMEN THAT

40
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:51,493
TURNED OUT AT ALL THE PLACES

41
00:00:51,494 --> 00:00:53,262
THAT I WENT, ALL THE EVENTS

42
00:00:53,263 --> 00:00:54,463
SUPPORTING THE PRESIDENT,

43
00:00:54,464 --> 00:00:56,265
SUPPORTING THE MIDTERM

44
00:00:56,266 --> 00:00:57,666
CANDIDATES, IT WAS -- I MEAN

45
00:00:57,667 --> 00:01:00,202
PRETTY AMAZING.

46
00:01:00,203 --> 00:01:01,770
IT IS SAD THAT THE MEDIA

47
00:01:01,771 --> 00:01:03,005
FOCUSES ON THIS SORT OF THING

48
00:01:03,006 --> 00:01:04,206
INSTEAD OF WHAT THE PRESIDENT

49
00:01:04,206 --> 00:01:05,173
HAS DONE.

50
00:01:05,175 --> 00:01:06,408
INSTEAD OF THE REASON THAT

51
00:01:06,409 --> 00:01:07,643
PEOPLE WILL VOTE FOR HIM AGAIN

52
00:01:07,644 --> 00:01:08,711
IN 2020.

53
00:01:08,712 --> 00:01:09,912
I THINK MORE PEOPLE WILL VOTE

54
00:01:09,913 --> 00:01:11,480
FOR HIM IN 2020 THAN EVEN DID

55
00:01:11,481 --> 00:01:12,281
IN 2016.

56
00:01:12,282 --> 00:01:13,515
WOMEN IN THIS COUNTRY WANT TO

57
00:01:13,516 --> 00:01:14,917
KNOW THE COUNTRY IS HEADED IN

58
00:01:14,918 --> 00:01:16,452
THE RIGHT DIRECTION.

59
00:01:16,453 --> 00:01:17,453
THEY WANT TO KNOW THEIR

60
00:01:17,454 --> 00:01:18,654
CHILDREN ARE BEING TAKEN CARE

61
00:01:18,655 --> 00:01:20,089
OF, THAT THE FUTURE IS GOOD

62
00:01:20,090 --> 00:01:21,824
FOR THEM, THAT THE COUNTRY IS

63
00:01:21,825 --> 00:01:22,191
SAFER.

64
00:01:22,192 --> 00:01:24,026
AND UNDER TRUMP, THEY CAN SAY

65
00:01:24,027 --> 00:01:25,361
ALL THE THINGS ARE TRUE.

66
00:01:25,362 --> 00:01:26,662
THE ECONOMY IS BOOMING.

67
00:01:26,663 --> 00:01:28,097
MANY TIMES PEOPLE HAVE MONEY

68
00:01:28,098 --> 00:01:30,199
NOW TO SEND THEIR CHILDREN TO

69
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:32,401
COLLEGE POSSIBLY, THEY DIDN'T

70
00:01:32,402 --> 00:01:32,768
BEFORE.

71
00:01:32,769 --> 00:01:33,802
THESE ARE THINGS THAT WOMEN

72
00:01:33,803 --> 00:01:35,004
CARE ABOUT MORE THAN TWEETS

73
00:01:35,005 --> 00:01:36,639
FROM THE PRESIDENT.

74
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:37,273
>> Shannon: WHAT DO YOU

75
00:01:37,274 --> 00:01:39,975
THINK OF THE POLLS THAT SHOW

76
00:01:39,976 --> 00:01:41,110
18-POINT DEFICIT AMONG THE

77
00:01:41,111 --> 00:01:42,411
GENDER GAP FOR THE REPUBLICANS

78
00:01:42,412 --> 00:01:43,779
WITH WOMEN?

79
00:01:43,780 --> 00:01:45,214
DO YOU THINK THE MESSAGE IS

80
00:01:45,215 --> 00:01:47,149
NOT GETTING THROUGH OR IS IT

81
00:01:47,150 --> 00:01:48,417
OVERSHADOWED IN THE TWEETS AND

82
00:01:48,418 --> 00:01:49,685
THE BACK-AND-FORTH?

83
00:01:49,686 --> 00:01:50,719
>> I HAVE NEVER BELIEVED

84
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:51,053
POLLS.

85
00:01:51,054 --> 00:01:52,855
WE SAW POLLS IN 2016 WERE NOT

86
00:01:52,856 --> 00:01:53,622
ACCURATE AT ALL.

87
00:01:53,623 --> 00:01:54,957
I STILL THINK THAT IT CARRIES

88
00:01:54,958 --> 00:01:55,891
OVER NOW A BIT.

89
00:01:55,892 --> 00:01:58,827
I WILL TELL YOU AFTER WHAT I

90
00:01:58,828 --> 00:02:00,562
CALL THE KAVANAUGH EFFECT,

91
00:02:00,563 --> 00:02:02,464
HONESTLY AFTER THE KAVANAUGH

92
00:02:02,465 --> 00:02:03,499
CONFIRMATION THE NUMBER OF

93
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:04,733
WOMEN THAT ARE MORE INSPIRED

94
00:02:04,734 --> 00:02:05,901
ON THE REPUBLICAN END NOW TO

95
00:02:05,902 --> 00:02:07,836
GET OUT AND VOTE IS REALLY

96
00:02:07,837 --> 00:02:08,237
ASTONISHING.

97
00:02:08,238 --> 00:02:09,705
I FOUND WOMEN COMING UP TO ME

98
00:02:09,705 --> 00:02:11,307
TO TELL ME HOW FRUSTRATED THEY

99
00:02:11,308 --> 00:02:12,942
WERE WITH THAT AND HOW MUCH IT

100
00:02:12,943 --> 00:02:14,243
MAKES THEM WANT TO VOTE FOR

101
00:02:14,244 --> 00:02:14,643
REPUBLICANS.

102
00:02:14,644 --> 00:02:15,911
I DON'T KNOW THAT THE POLLS

103
00:02:15,912 --> 00:02:17,212
ARE REFLECTING THE SENTIMENTS

104
00:02:17,213 --> 00:02:20,282
OF THE WOMEN IN THIS COUNTRY.

105
00:02:20,283 --> 00:02:21,750
>> Shannon: POLLS ASIDE.

106
00:02:21,751 --> 00:02:23,452
A WOMAN WHO WAS SPEAKER OF THE

107
00:02:23,453 --> 00:02:24,687
HOUSE AND HOPES TO BE AGAIN.

108
00:02:24,688 --> 00:02:26,121
THE HOUSE MINORITY LEADER

109
00:02:26,122 --> 00:02:27,623
NANCY PELOSI.

110
00:02:27,624 --> 00:02:28,857
>> IF THE ELECTION WERE TODAY

111
00:02:28,858 --> 00:02:30,459
WE WOULD WIN THE MAJORITY.

112
00:02:30,460 --> 00:02:37,066
I DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH WOULD BE

113
00:02:37,067 --> 00:02:41,136
INVOLVED BUT WE WOULD WIN THE

114
00:02:41,137 --> 00:02:41,503
MINORITY.

115
00:02:41,504 --> 00:02:44,139
WAVE OR TSUNAMI, WE'LL SEE IN

116
00:02:44,140 --> 00:02:44,673
THREE WEEKS.

117
00:02:44,674 --> 00:02:45,441
>> Shannon: SHE SAID IT

118
00:02:45,442 --> 00:02:47,343
WOULD BE A BLUE WAVE OR BLUE

119
00:02:47,344 --> 00:02:47,710
TSUNAMI.

120
00:02:47,711 --> 00:02:49,645
HOW RIGHT DO YOU THINK SHE IS?

121
00:02:49,646 --> 00:02:50,913
>> I'M GOING TO HOPE SHE IS

122
00:02:50,914 --> 00:02:52,815
REALLY WRONG AND I THINK THAT

123
00:02:52,816 --> 00:02:54,416
WE ARE GOING TO ALL HAVE TO

124
00:02:54,417 --> 00:02:54,883
WAIT AND SEE.

125
00:02:54,884 --> 00:02:56,819
I WILL TELL YOU EVERYWHERE I

126
00:02:56,820 --> 00:02:58,020
HAVE TRAVELED, THE NUMBER OF

127
00:02:58,021 --> 00:02:59,521
THE WOMEN THAT ARE COMING OUT,

128
00:02:59,522 --> 00:03:00,889
THAT ARE NOT JUST EXCITED TO

129
00:03:00,890 --> 00:03:02,424
VOTE IN THE MIDTERMS BUT THAT

130
00:03:02,425 --> 00:03:03,692
ARE VOLUNTEERING AND WORKING

131
00:03:03,693 --> 00:03:05,327
THE POLLS -- MY MOM IS

132
00:03:05,328 --> 00:03:07,096
ACTUALLY WORKING THE POLLS IN

133
00:03:07,097 --> 00:03:07,863
NORTH CAROLINA.

134
00:03:07,864 --> 00:03:09,765
IT'S PRETTY INCREDIBLE.

135
00:03:09,766 --> 00:03:11,133
I THINK THAT WOMEN ARE

136
00:03:11,134 --> 00:03:12,368
EXCITED.

137
00:03:12,369 --> 00:03:14,269
THE MEN ARE EQUALLY HAS

138
00:03:14,270 --> 00:03:15,571
EXCITED ACROSS THE COUNTRY.

139
00:03:15,572 --> 00:03:18,307
I THINK THE REPUBLICANS AS A

140
00:03:18,308 --> 00:03:20,642
WHOLE ARE GALVANIZE AND

141
00:03:20,643 --> 00:03:21,010
UNIFIED.

142
00:03:21,011 --> 00:03:23,912
IF FOR NO OTHER REASON THAN

143
00:03:23,913 --> 00:03:25,647
THE DEMOCRATS ARE ACTING SO

144
00:03:25,648 --> 00:03:26,515
CRAZY PEOPLE IN THE REPUBLICAN

145
00:03:26,516 --> 00:03:27,916
PARTY ARE COMING TOGETHER TO

146
00:03:27,917 --> 00:03:30,119
SAY WE CAN'T ALLOW THIS TO

147
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:30,686
OVERTAKE OUR COUNTRY.

148
00:03:30,687 --> 00:03:33,188
IF WE HAVE A SPEAKER NANCY

149
00:03:33,189 --> 00:03:35,657
PELOSI, OR A SENATE MAJORITY

150
00:03:35,658 --> 00:03:37,526
LEADER CHUCK SCHUMER, THAT

151
00:03:37,527 --> 00:03:38,594
WILL SPELL DISASTER FOR THE

152
00:03:38,595 --> 00:03:38,961
COUNTRY.

153
00:03:38,962 --> 00:03:39,895
THE PRESIDENT'S AGENDA WILL

154
00:03:39,896 --> 00:03:41,096
NOT GET ACCOMPLISHED.

155
00:03:41,097 --> 00:03:42,264
EVERYTHING WE HAVE SEEN

156
00:03:42,265 --> 00:03:44,199
POSITIVE HAPPEN IN THIS

157
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:45,000
COUNTRY UNDER PRESIDENT TRUMP

158
00:03:45,001 --> 00:03:46,135
WILL COME TO A SCREECHING

159
00:03:46,136 --> 00:03:46,468
HALT.

160
00:03:46,469 --> 00:03:47,503
PEOPLE UNDERSTAND THEY WILL

161
00:03:47,504 --> 00:03:49,071
TRY TO IMPEACH HIM.

162
00:03:49,072 --> 00:03:50,339
AND ALL THE FORWARD PROGRESS

163
00:03:50,340 --> 00:03:51,273
WILL STOP.

164
00:03:51,274 --> 00:03:52,207
I THINK PEOPLE UNDERSTAND THAT

165
00:03:52,208 --> 00:03:53,809
IT IS SO IMPORTANT TO GET OUT

166
00:03:53,810 --> 00:03:55,077
AND VOTE IN THE MIDTERMS.

167
00:03:55,078 --> 00:03:56,412
>> Shannon: WHAT ABOUT THE

168
00:03:56,413 --> 00:03:58,247
CONVERSATION ABOUT CIVILITY

169
00:03:58,248 --> 00:03:58,614
NOW?

170
00:03:58,615 --> 00:03:59,715
WE SEE THERE ARE SUGGESTIONS

171
00:03:59,716 --> 00:04:01,150
TO GET IN PEOPLE'S FACES AND

172
00:04:01,151 --> 00:04:02,117
FIND THEM IN PUBLIC.

173
00:04:02,118 --> 00:04:03,419
WE SEE IT HAPPENING.

174
00:04:03,420 --> 00:04:04,887
THEN PEOPLE AGITATE ON SOCIAL

175
00:04:04,888 --> 00:04:05,988
MEDIA, MAKE SURE YOU GET OUT

176
00:04:05,989 --> 00:04:06,422
THERE.

177
00:04:06,423 --> 00:04:07,489
I DON'T KNOW IF IT HAPPENS TO

178
00:04:07,490 --> 00:04:07,856
YOU.

179
00:04:07,857 --> 00:04:09,491
IT'S PRETTY WIDESPREAD.

180
00:04:09,492 --> 00:04:10,926
BUT THOSE THAT WILL SAY THE

181
00:04:10,927 --> 00:04:12,361
PRESIDENT STARTED THIS BY

182
00:04:12,362 --> 00:04:15,230
CARRIAGING NAME CALLING AND

183
00:04:15,231 --> 00:04:16,265
EN -- BY ENCOURAGING NAME

184
00:04:16,266 --> 00:04:17,366
CALLING AND ENCOURAGING PEOPLE

185
00:04:17,367 --> 00:04:19,068
TO GET ROUGH WITH PROTESTERS

186
00:04:19,069 --> 00:04:20,002
AT THE RALLIES.

187
00:04:20,003 --> 00:04:21,136
WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF THE

188
00:04:21,137 --> 00:04:22,237
CONVERSATION?

189
00:04:22,238 --> 00:04:24,306
>> THAT IS RIDICULOUS.

190
00:04:24,307 --> 00:04:25,407
THE REPUBLICANS ARE THE PARTY

191
00:04:25,408 --> 00:04:26,608
OF JOBS AND THE DEMOCRATS ARE

192
00:04:26,609 --> 00:04:27,976
THE PARTY OF MOBS.

193
00:04:27,977 --> 00:04:29,311
IT'S DISGUSTING THAT THERE IS

194
00:04:29,312 --> 00:04:33,115
ANYONE CALLING FOR VIOLENCE OR

195
00:04:33,116 --> 00:04:34,450
ANYTHING AS AGREESIVE AS WHAT

196
00:04:34,451 --> 00:04:36,118
WE HAVE SEEN COME OUT OF SOME

197
00:04:36,119 --> 00:04:37,453
DEMOCRAT LEADER'S MOUTH.

198
00:04:37,454 --> 00:04:39,555
YOU ARE HEARD MAXINE WATERS

199
00:04:39,556 --> 00:04:40,856
CALLING FOR THIS STUFF.

200
00:04:40,857 --> 00:04:42,357
IT'S HAPPENED TO SO MANY

201
00:04:42,358 --> 00:04:43,058
PEOPLE.

202
00:04:43,059 --> 00:04:43,792
IT'S DISGUSTING.

203
00:04:43,793 --> 00:04:45,094
THIS IS NOT AMERICA.

204
00:04:45,095 --> 00:04:46,395
WE ARE ALL AMERICANS.

205
00:04:46,396 --> 00:04:48,430
WE CAN DISAGREE AND WE CAN BE

206
00:04:48,431 --> 00:04:49,965
CIVIL ABOUT IT.

207
00:04:49,966 --> 00:04:52,734
ALL I WILL SAY IS THAT IF YOU

208
00:04:52,735 --> 00:04:55,170
HAVE NOT SEEN THE NONSENSE

209
00:04:55,171 --> 00:00:00,000
FROM THE REPUBLICAN SIDE.
