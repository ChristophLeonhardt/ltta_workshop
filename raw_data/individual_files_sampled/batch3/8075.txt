♪ ♪ YOU SEE WHAT IS HAPPENING WITH CHINA. WE HAVE NO CHOICE. THAT SHOULD'VE BEEN DONE YEARS AGO. WE HAVE NO CHOICE. OPERATING AGAINST THE REST OF THE WORLD. WE WANT A CONSTRUCTIVE RELATIONSHIP WITH THE GOVERNMENT OF CHINA. IN ORDER TO DO THAT, WE NEED TO REPAIR, MAKE SOME PROGRESS ON SOME ISSUES RELATED TO TRADE. WE ADVISE THE U.S. TO REMAIN RATIONAL AND STOP SUCH WARS TO HARM ITSELF AND OTHERS. THIS IS THE ONLY VIABLE WAY OUT. Bret: THE THREAT OF $200 BILLION OF ADDITIONAL TARIFFS AGAINST CHINA SENT THE MARKETS REELING NOT ONLY HERE BUT AROUND THE WORLD, ESPECIALLY ASIA. THE DOW DROPPING 400-POINT. DOWN AT 270 AT THE END. IT MADE THINGS ROCKY AND THERE WERE A LOT OF PEOPLE ON CAPITOL HILL WEIGHING IN ON ALL SIDES. BACK WITH THE PANEL. JONAH, WHAT ABOUT THE STRATEGY, AND CAN THE PRESIDENT AND THE ADMINISTRATION FORCED CHINA TO BUCKLE? AND PRETTY SKEPTICAL. CHINA HAS A LONG HISTORY OF CHINA HAS A MUCH BIGGER NATIONALISM PROBLEM THAN ALMOST ANYTHING ELSE IN THE IDEA OF INVESTING THEIR NATIONAL PRIDE IN BEING SEEN AS LOSING FACE TO THE WEST OR TO AMERICANS IS A REAL PROBLEM POLITICALLY. BUT ALSO, IT'S WORTH POINTING OUT THAT THE DOW IS DOWN, NEGATIVE FOR THE YEAR. THE DOW USED TO BE THE TALKING POINT ABOUT THE INDICATOR OF HOW WELL THINGS ARE GOING. THEY NOW POINTED BETTER ONES LIKE UNEMPLOYMENT AND WHATNOT. TRADE WARS ARE NOT EASY TO WIN AND THEY ARE VERY HARD TO END. RIGHT NOW, STILL PRICES IN THE UNITED STATES ARE UP 40%. WE HAVE A LOT MORE PEOPLE EMPLOYED BY FIRMS THAT USE STEEL AND MAKE THEM. THIS COULD GO SOUTH VERY QUICKLY AND IT MAKES ME VERY NERVOUS. Bret: TRADE REPRESENTATIVE ROBERT LIGHTHIZER RUNNING POINT ON THIS. WHAT WE NEED FOR THE AMERICAN PEOPLE IS UNENFORCEABLE, ACCOUNTABLE SYSTEMATIC CHANGE STRUCTURAL IN NATURE SO WE CAN HAVE FREE, FAIR, AND BALANCED TRADE NOT JUST WITH CHINA BUT WITH THE REST OF THE WORLD. WE ARE LOOKING FORWARD TO THAT DAY, BUT THAT IS NOT THIS DAY. I'VE NEVER BEEN A BIG FAN OF PETER NAVARRO. THE PRESIDENT HIMSELF IS, IS KIND OF GOING ALONG WITH IT. I THINK THAT PRESIDENT HAS GOT TO WAKE UP AND REALIZE THAT'S NOT THE WAY TO GO. Bret: A LOT PEOPLE SAY IT'S THEY DON'T KNOW, AS JONAH SAID, HOW IT'S GOING. THERE'S OTHERS WHO SAY THIS NEEDS TO BE SHAKEN UP IN THE WORLD ORDER OF THINGS. I AM ONE OF THEM. I THINK ORRIN HATCH NEEDS TO WAKE UP. HE AND THE OTHER MEMBERS OF THE CONSENSUS THAT'S BEEN BUILDING AROUND CHINA EVER SINCE THE LATE '90s THAT WE NEED TO ENGAGE AND BE OPEN ALL THE REST AND IT WILL IMPROVE THEIR BEHAVIOR, IT'S PROVED TO BE COMPLETELY WRONG. EVER SINCE WE'VE BEEN ENGAGING ECONOMICALLY WITH CHINA, THEIR BEHAVIOR HAS GOTTEN MORE AND MORE AUTHORITATIVE. THEY HAVE SET OUT A PLAN FOR WORLD DOMINATION, ECONOMICALLY AND MILITARILY. THEY HAVE A PLAN TO BEAT US. WE NEED A PLAN TO BEAT THEM. I THINK IT'S GREAT WHERE STANDING UP TO THEM BUT FRANKLY I DON'T THINK THESE MEASURES GO FAR ENOUGH. I WOULD SAY WE NEED A COMPLETE ECONOMIC BOYCOTT OF CHINA. THAT'S THE ONLY WAY TO FACE DOWN THIS THREAT. IF THE WORLD IS RUN ACCORDING TO THE VALUES OF THE AUTHORITARIAN COMMUNIST DICTATORSHIP LED BY XI JINPING, IT'S NOT A WORLD WE WANT Bret: WHAT HAPPENS TO ALL THE COMPANIES THEY DO BUSINESS WITH CHINA? THE WORKERS WOULD FILL IN ON THE THIS ARGUMENT I MADE THIS ARGUMENT. THERE'S A WORLD OF OPPORTUNITY BEYOND CHINA. AFRICA, SOUTH AMERICA, INDIA, THE GREATEST DEMOCRACY. THAT'S WHERE WE SHOULD BE PUTTING OUR PARTY. TO SUCK UP TO CHINA HAS BEEN A COMPLETE DISASTER. Bret: A.B., HOW DOES IT PLAY POLITICALLY? STRANGE BEDFELLOWS. YOU HAVE DEMOCRATS APPLAUDING THE MOVES FROM INCLUDING SENATOR SCHUMER. YOU HAVE DEMOCRATS LIKE THE ONE IN OHIO OWNING THE TARIFFS SAYING HE HAS BEEN IN THE BERNIE SANDERS WING ON THE FAR LEFT. IN UNISON WITH TRUMP ON THIS FOR A LONG TIME. YOU HAVE OTHER REPUBLICANS IN STATES WITH FARMERS. I READ YESTERDAY THAT THE HIT TO SOYBEAN FARMERS IN IOWA ALONE WILL EXCEED $600 MILLION. ALL THE PLANNING HAS TO HAPPEN NOW. WHETHER OR NOT WE CAN DETERMINE OR THE MARKET CAN DETERMINE OR THEIR POOR REPUBLICAN CONGRESSMAN RUNNING FOR REELECTION CAN DETERMINE WHAT TRUMP IS REALLY GOING TO FINALLY DO, ALL OF THE PLANNING THAT'S TAKING PLACE NOW, DISRUPTION IS UNDERWAY DOMESTICALLY AND IN A NATIONALLY THROUGH PORTS, PEOPLE PLANNING THEIR INVENTORY, IT'S ALL RIPPLING OUT. THE POOR MEMBERS OF CONGRESS WHO THINK THEY ARE GOING TO GET AN ANSWER FROM PRESIDENT TRUMP AND WHETHER IT'S A TACTIC OR DEFINITELY A TRADE WAR THAT'S GOING TO BE EASY TO WIN ARE GOING TO BE SITTING AROUND WAITING TO SEE THE MARKET RESPONSE AND THE VOTER RESPONSE. IT'S REALLY SCARING THEM. THEY WON'T BRING IT UP WITH HIM. BUT AS YOU KNOW IT'S ALL THE TALK. Bret: THAT'S WHAT HE STARTED WITH IN THE MEETING. QUICKLY, JONAH, TEND EVENTUALLY YOU HAVE CHINA WORKING ON THE NORTH KOREA ISSUE WHETHER THEY ARE HELPING ARE NOT AND IT FACTORS IN AS WELL. IT DOES AND IT'S ONE OF THE QUESTIONS WE DON'T KNOW. IT'S IN CHINA AND NORTH KOREA'S INTERESTS TO RUN OUT THE CLOCK AS LONG AS POSSIBLE ON THESE NEGOTIATIONS. I THINK IS WHAT CHINA WANTS TO DO. I THINK NORTH KOREA IS STILL ESSENTIALLY AN UNRULY VASSAL STATE OF CHINA AND HOW YOU NEGOTIATE THIS TRADE WAR STUFF WHILE AT THE SAME TIME FIGURING OUT HOW YOU KEEP NORTH KOREA ON THE PATH THROUGH THIS ELEGY TO DO LOCALIZATION SEEMS TO ME IT'S
