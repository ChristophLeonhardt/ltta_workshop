interesting purge going on at the DNC now when Tom Perez won he was backed by the entirety of the establishment mainly pushed by Barack Obama they wanted to make sure that keith ellison didn't win keith ellison had support of Bernie Sanders and he was a progressive and they didn't want that so they sent in Tom Perez and they said oh you know I mean he's done some things at Labor he's fine he's a good progressive don't worry about it and it was a hard-fought battle and they played super dirty and they had some terrible charges that they put out about keith ellison I don't want to repeat them now they never do that for Republicans but when I was progressives they knew how to fight dirty against progressives obviously if you're there because they're the Democratic establishment now at the time though after he won this all kumbaya keith ellison is gonna join his vice chair it's okay we got a unity reform commission it's gonna do reforms we're gonna unify we're gonna bring in some bernie sanders people not as much as hillary clinton people okay i get it she won the primary and but and and so whatever you do don't worry okay it were this is all together all together hold hands not anymore now all of a sudden it looked like it was a fun wedding until they took out the daggers and it turned into a red wedding or in this case maybe a blue wedding so let me tell you what happened next NBC news reporting a shake-up is underway at the Democratic National Committee as several key longtime officials have lost their posts exposing a still raw rift in the party and igniting anger among those in the progressive wing hmm now look this is they're gonna get rid of a bunch of Allison and Bernie supporters I'm gonna tell you all about that but the most important thing is why NBC News report did not report that but I will okay but let me give you more details about what happened here complaints began immediately after party officials saw list of Perez's appointments the DNC committees and his roster of 75 at-large members were chosen by the chair so he has a new list gets rid of a bunch of people and very important and it gives it new people okay the removal and demotion of a handful of veteran operatives stood out as did what critics charges the over-representation of Clinton backed members on the rules and bylaws committee which helped set the terms for the party's presidential primary uh here we go so when everybody was looking and there was a big interesting race going on Oh kumbaya now people are not looking as much and so now all of a sudden the Rules Committee gets to make the decisions on what the Unity Reform Commission suggests so the way that they work is to oh unity unity where you bring it together but it's okay we're gonna do reform now they're about to make their recommendations they just had a meeting in Vegas but their recommendations goes to the Rules Committee the Rules Committee now has nothing but Clinton supporters so they could take those recommendations ago oh I'm so glad you helped us do that Kabuki theater about unity oh look at these yeah no we're not doing that okay so let me tell you who got purged at these different committees and and and and summit that were at-large members ray Buckley the New Hampshire Democratic Chairman and longtime DNC official who ran against Perez for chair before backing representative Keith Ellison Buckley lost his spots on the executive committee and the DNC Rules Committee oh you backed Ellison now we can't have you on the Rules Committee they're gonna make the decisions now one of those decisions is really important again NBC great job in reporting this but they don't have the next layer as to why okay the one of the decisions is then affects the executive committee so the Rules Committee makes the decisions about what the rules are going to be but it might turn out that the Unity Reform Commission suggests that the budget actually be seen by the executive committee now this is unbelievable if you don't know how the DNC works and honestly I didn't until recently until after the election and we began to dive into this it turns out that there's only two people who are allowed to see the tired of the DNC budget so you guys all give money and you know you think it's gonna go to a good cause and then tom has the chair the chair that's why they needed the chair the chair can see the budget the chair controls the budget and the treasurer and that's it nobody else is allowed to see the budget what okay now they might say okay hey listen man we can't have the riffraff looking at our budget I don't know that I agree with that but at least you there's some logic into hey wait I don't want this to be public okay but at least some other folks should look at it at the DNC right not okay I would argue all the DNC members but they say no no no it can leak and we don't want a public uh center but at least the executive committee right and right now the answer is no so some folks on the reform commission are saying let the executive committee see the budget why do they care about the budget because it's about the money Lebowski so the guys who are actually controlling the Democratic Party when we say Clinton people it's largely Democratic consultants they're the ones making all the money they're the ones that take your money decide where it goes and you're gonna be shocked to find out that a lot of it goes straight into their pockets gee I wonder why they don't want anybody else to see the budget so the Reform Commission suggested to the Rules Committee the Rules Committee is now all Clinton people and it might kill it but if it doesn't kill it and it passes it and and and has them then all of a sudden Perez the chair has to show the budget and how the money is spent to the executive committee well then I got to get rid of the people in the executive committee who are Elson people so all of a sudden they're gonna get purged ray Buckley you ran for head of the whole organization you've been part of this for twenty years you're you're the chair of the New Hampshire Democratic Party which is enormous ly important gone unity my ass you're gone we can't have you people looking at the real numbers James Zogby the President of the arab-american Institute and prominence Sanders backer is no longer co-chair of the resolutions committee and is also off the executive committee a spot he has held since 2001 you've been there for decades you've been there for the Democratic Party but you made one mistake you back Bernie Sanders now the executive committee if they're gonna look at the budget we can't have anybody from Bernie's team looking at the budget you're gone it's gonna be fascinating to see what keith ellison does here cuz keith Ellison will still be part of the executive committee because he's this he's in the vice-chair role a role that they made up for him so is he gonna say oh okay I guess you took out all my guys that's fine Keith won when they came for James and they came for a ray and they came for all these other people what did you do so I don't nobody's gonna play ball I don't know I have no idea I didn't talk to him I don't know it on the one hand he could stay and he would have access to the budget and maybe if there are issues he could tell us on the other hand it doesn't look like anyone is left on those committees that the Clinton people don't trust I can't believe the Clintons are still running the Democratic Party she lost the Donald Trump and he's still have a lock on it why cuz it's about the money okay now more people who were taken out a lustrum on the party's longtime former secretary in a vocal Elson Becker who was removed from her large apartment to the DNC she's gone Barbara Casper sipper Steen who supported Ellison and Buckley was tossed from the executive committee man lots of people leaving the executive committee what a coincidence now Alice Ramon says it's quite unusual for a former party officer who's been serving on the DNC for forever to just be left out in the cold without even a call from the Chairman so I assume it has something to do with myself support for Keith so yeah if all the people that were removed were Ellis and his Sanders people and all the people who replaced them were Clinton backers gee I wonder if that had something to do with it I can't quite tell and what is the one thing that the DNC the Democratic establishment loves to do they love to hide behind minorities so they said oh nobody talking about we've got a black millennial transgender person and we got some other and I got all this diversity diversity diversity wait is there diversity of opinions I mean if they're Millennials you would most of the Millennials are Bernie Sanders supporters are they Bernie Sanders supporters well no but they're transgender etc so which brings us back to supercede she made a good point Silverstein the DNC's first transgender member said I can't speak for Tom but you talk about diversity I'm extremely diverse Jewish veteran transgender lesbian grandparent and small-business owner so maybe it wasn't really about diversity maybe they're actually hiding behind diversity because they don't want diversity of ideas unity only if you bow your head and if you don't there's a red wedding in your future so all these folks got invited in to what seemed like was a unity event and come to find out that the Clintons send their regards the DNC I swear this yesterday they're considering a resolution within the the committee to get angus King from Maine and Bernie Sanders both independents since they caucus with Democrats to run as Democrats stop talking about this independent stuff so part of it says this should be resolved the dancing recognizes the important contributions that the independent senators these two and the draft also says they call on candidates and voters who share common goals and beliefs with Democrats to register or affiliate with the Democratic Party in 2017 18 and beyond so they can purge all of the people who support them within the committee but then when they want them to run and have the heads in the faces not have an I mix their name but a D so that they can continue to say these diverse people that are behind them in voting blocs are with us but within the within the committee we don't really care what's actually happening with their values in the people that support that's right and another huge vote is coming and that is on whether they're going to accept corporate cash or not progressives are saying no we should be uncorrupted you want to guess what the Tom Perez Clinton wing thinks you know what they think so they got to get ready for those votes and they got to keep that money flowing in and then out the door to those consultants we're gonna run those TV ads so we're gonna take their 15 percent we're gonna take your hard-earned money that you gave to the Democrats and run inefficient terrible campaigns that loose it Republicans over and over again but hey at least their kids went to private school support independent media come join us the Young Turks TYT net calm /join
