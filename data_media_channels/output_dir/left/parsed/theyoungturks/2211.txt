DONALD TRUMP WAS IN PENNSYLVANIA
DOING A RALLY FOR HIS REELECTION
WHICH IS STRANGE BECAUSE HE'S
ALREADY PRESIDENT AND THE
GENERAL ELECTION IS MORE
THAN TWO YEARS AWAY.
DURING HIS RALLY HE DECIDED TO
GO BACK TO THE SAME ANTICS WHERE
HE SAYS TERRIBLE THINGS ABOUT
FEMALES.
THE LATEST EXAMPLE IS MAXINE
WATERS.
TAKE A LISTEN.
>> MAXINE WATERS, A VERY LOW IQ
INDIVIDUAL, EVER SEE HER?
WE
WILL IMPEACH HIM, WE WILL
IMPEACH – BUT HE HASN'T
DONE ANYTHING WRONG – IT IS A
MATTER WE WILL IMPEACH HIM.
SHE IS A LOW IQ INDIVIDUAL.
>> THE WORST THING ABOUT IT IS
IF YOU LOOK BEHIND HIM
THERE ARE A BUNCH OF KIDS.
AND IT IS JUST SAD TO ME, I JUST
DON'T THINK THAT SOMETHING A KID
SHOULD LOOK AT AS A GOOD EXAMPLE
OF HOW PEOPLE SHOULD BEHAVE.
>> I AM LESS WORRIED ABOUT HIM
BEING RUDE THAN I AM AT THE
GREAT IRONY OF DONALD TRUMP
CALLING ANYONE ELSE LOW IQ.
>> I HAVE SOME FUN IN STORE FOR
YOU TO BUTTRESS YOUR POINT.
>>MAXINE WATERS HAS BEEN CALLED
A LOT OF THINGS AND SOME
JUSTIFIED CRITICISM ON SOME
ISSUES, SHE HAS BEEN A CHAMPION
ON OTHERS, BUT LOW IQ HAS NOT
BEEN A CRITICISM OF MAXINE
WATERS.
SHE IS VERY SAVVY, A POLITICAL
PLAYER IN WASHINGTON FOR A
LONG TIME.
FOR A CERTIFIABLE MORON TO CALL
ANYONE LOW IQ LET ALONE
MAXINE WATERS IS BOTH DISTURBING
AND I HAVE TO ADMIT HILARIOUS.
>>MAXINE
WATERS DID RESPOND TO THE
CRITICISM, LET'S TAKE A LOOK.
>> HE IS EXPERT AT NAME-CALLING,
I UNDERSTAND THAT IN ADDITION TO
CONTINUING HIS NAME-CALLING OF
ME REFERRING TO MY IQ AND
CALLING ME LOW IQ THAT HE
CONTINUED TO ATTACK ELIZABETH
WARREN, NANCY PELOSI, MADE SOME
REFERENCES TO OPRAH WINFREY AND
IT SEEMS THAT HE IS IDENTIFYING
AND PICKING UP MORE WOMEN THAN
HE IS ATTACKING, THIS IS NOT
ONLY TYPICAL OF HIM, THIS IS
WHAT THIS CONMAN DOES, HE
DIVERTS ATTENTION FROM HIMSELF
BY ATTACKING OTHERS.
THIS BUSINESS ABOUT STORMY IS
NOT GOING TO GO AWAY.
HE CAN CALL US ALL THE NAMES HE
WANTS TO BUT OUR SPECIAL COUNSEL
IS CONNECTING THE DOTS AND LAST
NIGHT IN A SPEECH I SAID THAT IF
FOR SOME REASON MUELLER DOES NOT
GET HIM, STORMY WILL.
I'M NOT INTIMIDATED BY HIM SO HE
CAN KEEP CALLING NAMES.
I'VE GOT PLENTY FOR HIM.
AS A MATTER OF FACT EVERYBODY
KNOWS HE'S A CONMAN, HE'S BEEN
A CONMAN ALL OF HIS LIFE, LONG
BEFORE HE EVER RAN FOR OFFICE
AND SO THIS CONMAN, CONMAN DON
IS GOING TO KEEP IT UP AND
AGAIN HE'S COMING FOR ME, I'M
COMING FOR HIM.
>>I LOVE THAT LAST SENTENCE.
>>YEAH, SHE IS NOT INTIMIDATED.
BY THE WAY YOU MENTIONED THE
IRONY.
WE'RE GOING TO GET TO HIM IN A
SECOND, BUT THE PEOPLE
BEHIND HIM WERE CHEERING HIM ON
AS HE SAYS THOSE THINGS
ABOUT MAXINE WATERS.
THERE HOLDING SIGNS THAT SAY
DRAIN THE SWAMP TO A PRESIDENT
THAT HAS REX TILLERSON, FORMER
CEO OF EXXON MOBIL SITTING THERE
IN HIS CABINET.
SIGMUND NGUYEN, WALL STREET
BANKER, GOOD JOB DRAINING
THE SWAMP.
LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT WHO LACKS
IQ.
IT'S DEFINITELY NOT MAXINE
WATERS.
>>YOU NOT SUPPOSED TO INSULT
REPUBLICAN VOTERS BECAUSE
MAINSTREAM MEDIA HATES THAT, ON
THE OTHER HAND FOR 40 YEARS
THEY'VE BEEN INSULTING LIBERALS
ON THE RADIO AND TV NONSTOP BUT
NOBODY EVER SAID THAT WAS NOT
ACCEPTABLE.
LAMY, THE CROWD FOR WHO THEY
ARE, THEY ARE THE CAST FOR THE
NEXT GOONIES THAT'S BEING SHOT.
DID YOUR FEELINGS GET HURT?
YOU
WENT TO AN IDIOTIC DONALD TRUMP
RALLY AND YOU CHEERED IT ALL THE
STUPID THINGS HE SAID AND I'M
SUPPOSED TO BE POLITE TO YOU?
THERE IS A GUY SEEMING TO WEAR A
TURTLE NECK 
BUT IT IS NOT A
NECK.
>>MAYBE THEY HAVE A POINT, LET'S
TAKE A LOOK AT HOW SMART
DONALD TRUMP IS.
>>THEY'RE GOING TO TAKE OUT
CLEAN COAL MEANING THEY ARE
TAKING OUT CALL, THEY ARE GOING
TO CLEAN IT.
LAMB THE SHAM, HE'S TRYING TO
ACT LIKE A REPUBLICAN SO HE GETS
– HE WILL GIVE ME ONE VOTE.
I DON'T KNOW IT LOOKS LIKE A
NICE GUY, I HEAR HE'S
NICE-LOOKING, I THINK I'M BETTER
LOOKING THAN HIM.
I DO.
AND HE IS SLIGHTLY YOUNGER THAN
ME.
NOBODY HAS MORE RESPECT 
FOR
WOMEN THAN I DO, NOBODY.
>> IT'S AN UNBELIEVABLY COMPLEX
SUBJECT.
NOBODY KNEW HEALTHCARE
COULD BE SO COMPLICATED?
WILL ROSIE O'DONNELL IS
DISGUSTING BOTH INSIDE AND OUT.
YOU TAKE A LOOK AT HER, SHE'S A
SLOB.
SHE TOXIC A TRUCK DRIVER.
WELL YOUR FATHER IS LOOKING DOWN
AND IS VERY PROUD 
OF YOU.
>>WELL, HE STILL ALIVE.
>> THEN HE'S EVEN MORE PROUD.
>> WE DON'T MAKE MISTAKES.
GO AHEAD KEN.
>>CHUCK HERE.
>>THAT IS OUR HIGH IQ PRESIDENT.
>> THE 
MINUTE YOU KNEW DONALD
TRUMP CAME INTO THE ROOM
SCREAMING HOW HE IS A SMART
PERSON WE COULD HAVE NOW SAID
THAT HE EVEN WROTE IT IN A TWEET
AND SCREAMED IN A TWEET THAT I
AM A VERY STABLE GENIUS.
YOU
SHOULD THOUGHT HE THINKS HE DOTH
PROTEST TOO MUCH.
