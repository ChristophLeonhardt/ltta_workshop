1
00:00:06,190 --> 00:00:11,399
We now have a crisis, an antibiotic
resistant crisis, you know, on our hands.

2
00:00:11,399 --> 00:00:17,620
Lots of bacteria, basically, became
resistant and became harder to kill.

3
00:00:19,950 --> 00:00:23,740
I would like to look at the
type of bacteria that lives

4
00:00:23,740 --> 00:00:27,939
in very rare
and extreme habitats.

5
00:00:27,940 --> 00:00:32,210
And I would like to see whether these
type of bacteria could be

6
00:00:32,220 --> 00:00:36,070
our new drug producers.

7
00:00:39,170 --> 00:00:45,120
From our experience studying a number
of different caves in western Canada,

8
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:48,899
this cave is very unique in the fact

9
00:00:48,899 --> 00:00:53,489
that the mineral content
in the bedrock is iron.

10
00:00:57,820 --> 00:01:02,579
To find a truly new and effective
molecule that can fight against

11
00:01:02,579 --> 00:01:05,629
these antibiotic resistant bacteria,

12
00:01:05,629 --> 00:01:08,879
you need to find a different
source of the bacteria.

13
00:01:15,870 --> 00:01:19,849
We looked at the different types
of decorations or speleothems

14
00:01:19,849 --> 00:01:23,990
to see whether we can find
rare bacteria from these.

15
00:01:23,990 --> 00:01:27,369
Because when you think about
it, these structures they

16
00:01:27,369 --> 00:01:30,379
are just purely mineral
and might have

17
00:01:30,379 --> 00:01:33,579
organic nutrients
for microbial life.

18
00:01:35,770 --> 00:01:41,750
If we don't have new drugs, people can
just have these unnecessary deaths

19
00:01:41,750 --> 00:01:45,770
from infections that used
to be treatable before.

20
00:01:47,300 --> 00:01:52,750
What we are doing right now can take 
a minimum of 10 years and up to 25 years

21
00:01:52,750 --> 00:01:57,310
and can take a billion dollars
for one antibiotic.

22
00:01:58,140 --> 00:00:00,000
So right now, basically, it's just
the first step of drug discovery.
