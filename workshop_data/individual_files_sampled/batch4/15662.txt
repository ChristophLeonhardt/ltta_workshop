when the Turks seized this American pastor very just recently they thought they were living in the pre Trump era they weren't after cash they were after the deportation of that guy I mentioned I think I'm saying the same right fethullah gulen I mentioned him before he's a former ally of air21 he's a Muslim preacher but they had a falling out and and now Gulen lives in the u.s. has for about 20 years but that made him actually the perfect enemy for erawan a real live enemy but hiding out in a foreign land undermining Turkey from abroad obviously in the pocket of evil America any conspiracy theory you like he was the perfect scapegoat for everything that went wrong in Turkey like I said everyone even blamed those pilots who shot down the Russian fighter jet they blamed them of acting on the behest of that Gulen fella in America in the fake coup of 2016 that air21 use just to smoke out all his enemies and kill him really Turkey used the Menace of Gulen as an excuse to sack hundreds thousands of people in public life from the Army from the courts even journalists it was the perfect perfect stag fire as you could say and I think that was pretty clearly what this kidnapping what pastor Brunson was about it was part of the same crazy scheme kidnap a pastor and then pull it trying to pull an iran bargain with trump to swap the pastor for this Turkish leader Gulen I mean hadn't Barack Obama basically done exactly that for a prisoner named Bowe Bergdahl remember him he was a US soldier in Afghanistan who just deserted just one day he got up left his base and walked over to the Taliban he just walked over to the enemy it sounds a lot like that Canadian kook Joshua Boyle who took his pregnant wife hiking in Taliban controlled Afghanistan and was captured and she was raped Bergdahl was captured almost immediately and I kept this a prisoner and Obama finally got him back by releasing five very senior Taliban generals they don't have that rank but these are senior Taliban they were all deemed high risk by the Pentagon they were all in Guantanamo Bay which is where the worst of the worst terrorists are kept and Obama sat those five senior terrorist free in return for getting Bowe Bergdahl the deserter back that's an excerpt from my daily show the Ezra Levant show weekdays at 8:00 p.m. Eastern every day I do a monologue interview a guest and read my fan mail and my hate mail to subscribe go to the rebel on media slash shows you
