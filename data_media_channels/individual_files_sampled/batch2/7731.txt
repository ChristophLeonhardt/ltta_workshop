today at the White House Donald Trump and some of both the students and parents involved in the tragic shooting last week as well as some others were involved in a listening session which is getting a lot of news and might lead to some action all done and that not necessarily the action that the students have been pushing for we're gonna play some videos for you now in this first video you're gonna see students Samuel zyf who is going to push for what he thinks is necessary to make students safe based on his experience at that shooting it's it's difficult footage but we want you to watch this and then see how it's responded to by the president to feel like this ever I can't I can't feel comfortable in my country knowing that people have will have ever gonna feel like this I want to feel safe at school you know senior year and junior big years for me when I turn my academics around started connecting with teachers and I started actually enjoying school and now I don't know how I'm ever gonna step foot on that place again or go to a public park after school or be walking anywhere me and my friends we get scared when a car drives by anywhere I don't understand I turned 18 the day after woke up to the news that my best friend was gone and I don't understand why I could still go in a store and buy a weapon of war an AR I was reading today that a person 20 years old walked into a store and bought an ar-15 in five minutes with an expired ID how is it that easy to buy this type of weapon it how do we not stop this after Columbine after City I'm sitting with a mother that lost her son it's still happening in Australia there was a shooting out of school in 1999 you know after that they took a lot of ideas they put legislation together and they stopped it can anyone here guess how many shootings there have been in two schools since then in Australia zero we need to do something that's why we're here yeah super powerful I'm so glad someone finally said it and you know god help us on what the Republicans are gonna say about the kid but how would you react if you saw your best friend getting shot and and it's a great question and it's a question the whole country's asking why are we letting people buy weapons of war and and let alone kids under 21 you can't buy a beer but you could buy an assault weapon and murder 17 people in a school madness so let's see how the president responds yeah okay when the next one the president was responding there's many people in the listening session victims of different tragedies families so people had also the next person who won't hear from brought up arming teachers as a potential thing and there was things about guarding the school putting um extra security measures but this just sir president's responding after hearing that student someone else that what about arming teachers and then the president goes in with this your concept and your idea about school concealed carry and it's it only works where you have people very adept at using firearms of which you have many and it would be teachers and coaches if the coach had a firearm in his locker when he ran at this guy coach was very brave saved a lot of lives I suspect but if he had a firearm he wouldn't had a run he would have shot and that would have been the end of it and this would only be obviously for people that are very adept at handling a gun and it would be it's called concealed carry where a teacher would have a concealed gun on them they'd go for special training and they would be there and you would no longer have a gun-free zone gun-free zone to a maniac because they're all cowards a gun-free zone is let's go in and let's attack because bullets aren't coming back at us you'd have a lot of people that be armed they'd be ready they're professionals there may be Marines that left the Marines left the army left the Air Force and they're very adept at doing that you'd have a lot of them and they'd be spread evenly throughout the school so the other thing I really believe that if these cowards knew that that was that the school was you know well guarded from the standpoint of having pretty much professionals with great training I think they wouldn't go into the school to start off with I think it could very well solve your problem so we'll be doing the background checks we'll be doing a lot of different things but we'll certainly be looking at ideas like that so he hears that impassioned plea from that student about are you do anything about the guns the guns that are killing us literally and he says yeah more guns the OK Corral was you know it's legendary because we hear about Western folklore in in the in US the shoot-out at OK Corral it was miniscule compared to the massacre in Florida let alone Vegas let alone Orlando little you know and and the list goes on and on so now the conservative and Donald Trump idea for school shootings is let's let's shoot back let's have more guns let's have the teachers carry weapons because you know when you get angry I'm sure that nothing will ever go wrong right this is the same idea they have like oh let's start to bring guns into bars oh that's a great idea and and so I've shown you over and over again or over this last week that the number of guns is the not only the main thing almost the only thing that correlates to more gun homicides in every country so it's a hundred and thirty studies have proven it out so if you have more guns in a school you will have more people dying from guns so it might be that somebody grabs the teachers gun maybe he leaves it out maybe he doesn't lock his locker maybe somebody got angry that is it accidentally accident we have lady I'll give you context now where's three times the size of Japan but Japan had 13 gun homicides in one year where we had 505 accidental discharge deaths from guns in that same year so even if you multiply two by three they'd be a 39 we'd be 505 just on accidents okay so they're gonna get more people killed here and then their idea for protecting your kids is oh don't worry we'll have shootouts inside the school yeah I mean we know there's a million studies that people with guns are more likely to escalate conflicts if you have a gun in your car you're more likely to flip people off follow them in your car I mean we still have the exact same conversation about gun-free zones so we always have these I don't know if that thing that he just said was more offensive or more stupid he seems to believe these students go to their school to shoot it up not because it has some special connection to them but purely because that's the place that there are no guns forget the fact of course that there was an armed guard at the school when this happened that's irrelevant doesn't matter if you don't have a hundred Marines doesn't count and he thinks that like if he knew they were guns there they wouldn't go there because you go there with the ar-15 to shoot up people because you think you're gonna get out can you name a single school shooter that escaped it is it large the vast majority are shot and killed everyone knows that everyone knows what happened at the end of Columbine the vast majority of these shooters are either captured or more likely killed none of them get out none of them go to the school because it's a safe place to shoot people they usually end up blowing their brains out or getting captured by police or shot in a shootout but how do you reason with a who is that stupid who doesn't understand the very foundation of the act that we're talking about if you want to get the whole young turks show every single day become a member TYT Network comm slash join and once you do you'll be saying you know I'm like a smart person or you might
