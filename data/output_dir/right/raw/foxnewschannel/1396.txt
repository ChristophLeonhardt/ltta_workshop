I ALWAYS SAY THAT I HOPE THAT

29
00:00:54,872 --> 00:00:56,040
PEOPLE UNDERSTAND THAT THEY TAKE

30
00:00:56,040 --> 00:00:58,208

OURSELVES BECAUSE OF THE

34
00:01:05,114 --> 00:01:06,383
SACRIFICES THAT THESE MEN AND

35
00:01:06,383 --> 00:01:06,784
WOMEN MADE.

36
00:01:06,784 --> 00:01:11,221
>> TELL US WHY RYAN WAS SO

37
00:01:11,221 --> 00:01:12,256
SPECIAL TO YOU AND EVERYBODY.

38
00:01:12,256 --> 00:01:14,024
>> HE WAS MY BROTHER AND BEST

39
00:01:14,024 --> 00:01:14,792
FRIEND.

40
00:01:14,792 --> 00:01:16,193
BUT TRAVIS SAID SOMETHING BEFORE

41
00:01:16,193 --> 00:01:17,995
LEAVING FOR HIS SECONDDY

42
00:01:17,995 --> 00:01:18,829
EMPLOYMENT TO IRAQ.

43
00:01:18,829 --> 00:01:21,065
AND MY HUSBAND ASKED HIM WHY HE

44
00:01:21,065 --> 00:01:23,434
HAD TO GO BACK AND HE SAID FIVE

45
00:01:23,434 --> 00:01:26,170
WORDS, IT'S NOT ME, THEN WHO.

46
00:01:26,170 --> 00:01:28,105
AND THOSE FIVE WORDS HAVE BECOME

47
00:01:28,105 --> 00:01:29,239
A MOVEMENT THROUGHOUT THIS

48
00:01:29,239 --> 00:01:30,708
ENTIRE COUNTRY.

49
00:01:30,708 --> 00:01:32,376
AND I THINK IT RESONATES.

50
00:01:32,376 --> 00:01:35,179
NOT JUST WITH THE MEN AND WOMEN

51
00:01:35,179 --> 00:01:38,082
WHO SERVE, THEY'RE ALL EXAMPLES

52
00:01:38,082 --> 00:01:39,750
OF THIS IDEA OF LIVING THIS

53
00:01:39,750 --> 00:01:41,385
IDEAL BUT ALSO BEING ABLE TO

54
00:01:41,385 --> 00:01:44,054
PASS IT DOWN TO THE NEXT

00:01:44,054 --> 00:01:44,455

TELL US WHAT YOU WANT TO DO WITH

62
00:01:59,003 --> 00:01:59,303

63
00:01:59,303 --> 00:02:00,471

TO MAKE THAT HAPPEN.

70
00:02:10,913 --> 00:02:12,950
WE GO OUT AND TRAIN VETERANS AND

71
00:02:12,950 --> 00:02:14,685

YOU WORKED WITH 40,000 YOUTH?

77
00:02:25,462 --> 00:02:28,766

78
00:02:28,766 --> 00:02:28,799

55% OF THEM WERE AT-RISK YOUTH.

84
00:02:31,635 --> 00:02:34,371
THEY ARE THE CATALYST TO

85
00:02:34,371 --> 00:02:35,873
CHANGING THE CHARACTERSHIP NP

86
00:02:35,873 --> 00:02:36,640
OUR COUNTRY.

87
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:40,244
>> YOUR DAD HAS WRITTEN AN

88
00:02:40,244 --> 00:02:42,980
AMAZING BOOK ABOUT TRAVIS' LIFE.

89
00:02:42,980 --> 00:02:45,315

YOU SEE PHOTOS OF HIM AND HE'S

91
00:02:47,484 --> 00:02:49,053
SO FULL OF LIFE.

92
00:02:49,053 --> 00:02:50,654
HE SEEMED SO HAPPY AND HONORED

93
00:02:50,654 --> 00:02:52,523
TO BE SERVING THIS COUNTRY.

94
00:02:52,523 --> 00:02:54,458
IF HE WERE HERE TODAY, WHAT

95
00:02:54,458 --> 00:02:55,693
MESSAGE WOULD HE GIVE THE

96
00:02:55,693 --> 00:02:57,327
MILITARY, THOSE WHO ARE IN THE

97
00:02:57,327 --> 00:02:58,796
POSITION THAT HE WAS THAT ARE

98
00:02:58,796 --> 00:02:59,129
SERVING.

99
00:02:59,129 --> 00:03:01,198
>> I THINK WHEN I TALK ABOUT

100
00:03:01,198 --> 00:03:04,101
BRENDON AND TRAVIS AND WHAT THEY

101
00:03:04,101 --> 00:03:04,468
REPRESENT.

102
00:03:04,468 --> 00:03:07,237
TO ME, TRAVIS WAS MY BROTHER,

103
00:03:07,237 --> 00:03:09,173
BRENDAN WAS MY FRIEND, THEY WERE

104
00:03:09,173 --> 00:03:10,741
BEST FRIENDS, AMAZING

105
00:03:10,741 --> 00:03:11,175
INDIVIDUALS.

106
00:03:11,175 --> 00:03:13,210
BUT I ALSO THINK THAT THEY

107
00:03:13,210 --> 00:03:14,645
REPRESENT THIS GENERATION OF MEN

108
00:03:14,645 --> 00:03:19,083
AND WOMEN WHO HAVE STEPPED UP TO

109
00:03:19,083 --> 00:03:20,050
SELFLESSLY SERVE.

110
00:03:20,050 --> 00:03:22,052
TO THANK THEIR NAME AND USE THEM

111
00:03:22,052 --> 00:03:23,287
AS AN EXAMPLE TO REPRESENT ALL

112
00:03:23,287 --> 00:03:25,055
OF THE MEN AND WOMEN IS THE WAY

113
00:03:25,055 --> 00:03:26,690
THAT WE CAN CONTINUE TO BRIDGE

114
00:03:26,690 --> 00:03:28,125
THE DIVIDE, MAKE SURE THAT

115
00:03:28,125 --> 00:03:29,259
PEOPLE UNDERSTAND THE SERVICE

116
00:03:29,259 --> 00:03:30,527
AND THE SACRIFICE OF THESE MEN

117
00:03:30,527 --> 00:03:30,928
AND WOMEN.

118
00:03:30,928 --> 00:03:32,362
>> ONE OF THE THINGS THAT'S COOL

119
00:03:32,362 --> 00:03:34,231
ABOUT THE FOUNDATION IS YOU'RE

00:03:34,231 --> 00:03:37,067
GOING RIGHT AT THE HEART OF THE

121
00:03:37,067 --> 00:03:38,502
BIG ISSUES WITH OUR COUNTRY BUT

122
00:03:38,502 --> 00:03:42,072
DOING IT WITH EVERY INDIVIDUAL

123
00:03:42,072 --> 00:03:42,840
AT A TIME.

124
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:45,142
IF OUR SCHOOLS AREN'T DOING IT,

125
00:03:45,142 --> 00:03:47,144
YOU'RE SAYING WE BETTER TRAIN

00:03:51,215 --> 00:03:51,682
GETTING AFTER.

129
00:03:51,682 --> 00:03:53,317
>> ABSOLUTELY.

130
00:03:53,317 --> 00:03:55,185
NOT ONLY THAT BUT THEY WANT TO

131
00:03:55,185 --> 00:03:56,186
DO IT

132
00:03:56,186 --> 00:03:57,421
THE VETERANS ARE RETURNING AND

133
00:03:57,421 --> 00:03:58,689
THEY WANT TO CONTINUE TO GIVE

134
00:03:58,689 --> 00:03:58,989
BACK.

135
00:03:58,989 --> 00:04:01,058
THEY'RE TAKING OFF THE UNIFORM

136
00:04:01,058 --> 00:04:03,193
BUT THEY'RE NOT NOT READY TO

137
00:04:03,193 --> 00:04:03,494
SERVE.

138
00:04:03,494 --> 00:04:04,962
WE WANT TO MAKE SURE WE'RE

139
00:04:04,962 --> 00:04:05,863
GIVING THEM THE OPPORTUNITY.

140
00:04:05,863 --> 00:04:07,364
>> THANK YOU FOR WHAT YOU FAMILY
