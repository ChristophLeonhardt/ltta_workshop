Tesla has come to the rescue in Puerto Rico in fact they have created a power infrastructure in order to allow a Children's Hospital in Puerto Rico to finally operate again now Tesla has used its solar panels and batteries to restore reliable electricity at San Juans hospital del Nino it's Children's Hospital in what company founder Elon Musk calls the first of many solar battery Tesla projects going live in Puerto Rico now remember earlier this week we did a story about how unfortunately Puerto Rico agreed to a 300 million dollar contract with a company a small utility company called white fish based out of Montana and it seems like there was some corruption that led to that deal but in this case Tesla is donating the solar power solar panels and the batteries necessary to allow this hospital to operate again now the hospital's new system allows it to generate all the energy it needs no fossil fuels no waste its renewable energy they're donating it for the time being and it's awesome yeah and so until they get back up on their feet and then they're gonna decide if they're gonna do a long term contract because it's not free forever but it is free for now and it allows them to serve 35 permanent residents with chronic conditions 3000 young patients that use the hospital and after the energy crisis over then they're gonna discuss whether there should be permanent but I love it for a number of reasons one is you know as Trump is going around going like nobody knew that things were gonna be this complicated right I mean I'd give myself an A+ an A+ for this but you know he's bumbling around and doing the corruption with white fish etc meanwhile out musk comes in and goes I got this dog okay yeah and boom they're right back up and and by the way look from time to time I say on the show I'm a capitalist this is outside of capitalist yep and now look I don't get too deep into it economic conversation about uh you know companies are structured but here's a company who's won innovated and done a great job of of doing innovation that might actually save the planet at some point and then and even if you're gonna be cynical about it he's there sophisticated enough to know it's great PR and it is you know what helping people is good PR and I and that's not a criticism that's great if you want to get more good PR by actually helping people in need that's a wonderful thing yeah I love this I love the fact that they utilized renewable energy which is to be expected with Tesla considering you know their entire business models based on you know saving the planet and doing doing better without using fossil fuels but I just I just like that there's some degree of humanity here which I feel like is lacking in all conversations that we've been having on the show recently and to finally see like an uplifting positive story makes me happy yeah by the way they're not the only company Google's parent company alphabet has also deployed balloons in an unfortunately named Project loon - and the reason is there that is providing both phone and internet connections so that people can get in touch with their family members that they were separated from and so that's also good PR good humanitarian thing to do good technology etc and look at some point this renewable energy stuff I hope saves the planet and I think there's a good chance that it will and not only just it's good for the planet but it's also great for the economy the renewable energy industry is adding jobs at a rate 12 times the rest of the country so if a lot of subsidies go to fossil fuel companies which is maddening and and they're not creating new jobs coal companies are not creating new jobs the renewable energy is creating new jobs and doing right or for the world so it's a rare win/win and thrilled to see it support independent media come join us to the Young Turks TYT Network comm / join
