Gary Cohn who served as an executive at Goldman Sachs and then later was an economic advisor for Donald Trump gave an interview to Reuters where he defended the big banks in the economic collapse that took place in 2008 he argued that no top bankers should have gone to jail for their role in the crisis because they did not necessarily do anything illegal in fact we have a clip for you from that very interview take a look what do you think about especially on the left this pronouncement that we we have intended too big to fail and you know some of your colleagues should have gone to jail at the time that no one was held accountable we haven't ended too big to fail we've created - we've created too big we've made rules and regulations that make the bigger bigger congratulations they have actually created legislation that says you have to be big to survive on your second question what laws were broken well people lost their homes people you know the banks took all the risk what laws were broken well that's what I'm asking you know asking him you said no you said no you said no one was indicted I thought the US criminal system to work that you had to break a law I didn't think you could be indicted for just because someone didn't like what you did well I guess it's you know is is being in some place in some cases reckless or stupid was the waitress in in Las Vegas who had six houses leveraged at a hundred percent with no income where she reckless and stupid was the banker regulus and stupid who broke the law I just want to know who you think broke the law no I know but you can understand you know people's anger so look again I love this I love this question that you and the media loved the answer no I love the 10-page supplement in the New York Times this week and when you got that number ten it was a blank page I would love someone to answer what laws were broken but you understand people anger I love the justice system this country it's one of our biggest competitive advantages that we have one most robust legal systems in the world so tell me what laws were broken again I don't know where you would say they were misled because the banks were marked the market the banks had their margin the banks had their security again I don't know what law was broken so I'll be your huckleberry and and I wish she was better prepared and she framed it as the left says this she didn't say that she thought laws were broken but I think laws were broken so I can it clearly explained to you simplest one is fraud financial fraud committed at a mass scale in fact they had congressional hearings about this and senator Levin from Michigan talked about it at length and then they had emails from by the way Goldman Sachs where you worked Gary Cohen and so they explained that they were suckering their own customers and they were selling for example 1 CDO called it called timber wolf and Tom Montague who was a senior executive of Goldman Sachs wrote in an email boy that timber wolf was one crappy deal so they knew here is a report from howl post back in 2010 in March 20 2007 memo the firm noted that it was game over for subprime as there was an accelerating meltdown for subprime lenders such as Fremont a new sentry an email the same month remarked that overall as a business we are selling our lungs and covering our shorts I'll explain what that means in a second part of the problem Levin said was that Goldman didn't tell its clients it was shorting the market throughout the year it waited until the end of the year so shorting something means that you're betting against it going along means that you're betting in favor of it so they were telling their customers oh timber wolf is great you should buy timber wolf etc meanwhile they were betting against a lot of those same securities so that is fraud your Tom people it's wonderful go buy it when you were betting against it and you knew it was junk and we have the emails to prove it those are the laws that were broken by you and your colleagues Gary Cohn for which you all should have gone to jail but what happened Obama covered your ass so Eric Holder in another congressional hearing the Attorney General at the time said that well if we put the bankers in jail it could upset the economic situation the financial well-being of the banks and the banks are simply too important to the global economic order we don't want to endanger that that is why we are not enforcing the laws against the bankers that is an amazing admission yeah it's ridiculous because the fact of the matter is that massive bailout that we gave to these too big to fail banks was meant to you know prevent the the chaos of them going under right there why should we protect the same executives who fueled the economic collapse that doesn't make any sense at all they need to be prosecuted they should be brought to justice and I wanted to just quickly comment on an example that Gary cone gave in that long rant protecting the banks and and blaming the consumers so he mentioned the Las Vegas waitress who has six homes and and you know six houses and and what was it hundred percent a leveraged at a hundred percent with no income okay so let me ask you something first of all I don't believe that story I don't believe that a Las Vegas waitress had six homes leveraged at a hundred percent but even if I give you the benefit of the doubt and that happened right because there were certainly people who took out mortgages who had no business taking out mortgages there's no question but it was the banks that encouraged them to take out those mortgages so you have the big banks who have the funds to give out these loans they are the deciders they're the decision makers right so the ball is in their court and they purposely gave out these subprime mortgages to people who would not be able to afford them as soon as the interest rates went up and then they went off and they bet against those consumers so now this is really important and and I want to explain it because he brought it back up so let's address what he's saying so why would a bank want to give a loan to someone that clearly can't afford it if it's a waitress and that she couldn't possibly have the ability to pay for those six homes why would the bank do something against their own interest well there is a reason why because they were using derivatives so the more mortgages there were the more they can gamble on them so this is was a fundamental misunderstanding that exists to this day the housing crisis was the trigger for the collapse but it wasn't a gun the gun was derivatives derivatives are what bankers like Gary Cohn used to gamble on different securities including the housing market so they wanted to have as many mortgages out there as possible to make money off of them and and here's a really important part because they make the bonuses in the short term and the costs are in the long term so they make money when they sell the mortgage they get commissions they get interest etc then they package up the mortgages into instruments they make money off of that then they do the derivatives which is betting on those sometimes a ten or a hundred times the value of the package of mortgages they make crazy money off of that now but that's set to blow because if you set up something that is that leveraged it will almost in every instance collapse but once they collapse their plan was it doesn't matter we're gonna turn around and that's exactly what Goldman Sachs did before it collapses we're gonna bet against it and we know how badly it's gonna collapse because we're the ones who built it so they made money on the way up and they made money on the way down and oftentimes by defrauding their own customers and their counterparties that was revealed by the way some of the fraud was so obvious that of most of the banks a lot of the banks admit it including the one that Steve minuchin our current Treasury secretary were worked out and ran and the one that was his colleague in the Trump administration and what do they do they paid billions of dollars in fines but less money than they made from the fraud in the first place and then they had Obama protect them and said they're too big to jail so Gary Cohn you know exactly how that works you're the one who built that in the first place he was among the top two executives at goldman sachs but he sits on that stage smug knowing that most people don't know what happened so he said oh please what laws were broken we did nothing wrong it was the waitresses fault he had the temerity to say that it was the waitresses fault yep no you set her up to fail and you knew it you made money off of both her the rise up and her demise and all of our demise as who lost eight million jobs but you kept all the bonuses you kept all the bonuses and you would have all gone bankrupt except the taxpayer bailed you out but Bush did Obama did Trump did and now you sit there all smug like a fat cat going suckers we got away with it we put the bill on you and now I get to pretend that I'm a genius who did everything right and it was the common man's fault for the problems that he created so this because one more thing that's important about this Gary Cohen topic and I'm advisor to Donald Trump he quit because of the tariffs he got his dilute that he wanted he went in there to rob the American people one more time through that giant multi trillion dollar tax cut for the rich and for corporations that Gary Cohen is friends with has worked for etc right and then when Trump started doing some crazy stuff with the tariffs he bailed so that he can then later be a hero say oh I stole papers off his desk I didn't let him do stupid things and hey I left early you could have left after charlottesville but you didn't you didn't you chose to stay why for the same reason as always Gary you're insatiable greed because you had to get that tax cut for you and your friends that's what you stayed for like what you see click this subscribe button below and don't forget to ring the bell to never miss another video from the Young
