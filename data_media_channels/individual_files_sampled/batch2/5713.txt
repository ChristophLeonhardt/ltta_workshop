today wraps up two of the most stressful weeks of Trump's presidency the international condemnation of his bizarre embrace of Putin followed by one of his most loyal fixtures warning that he'll tell Muller the Trump did okay the infamous Russia meeting at Trump Tower now those two stresses are linked they pose more intricate questions than the daily news cycles sometimes can handle which brings us actually to our new segment with a special friend of the beat Tony Schwartz this is called state of mind and we aim to get to the root of some of the bigger issues in our society here now many people hesitate to admit how stress and emotion impact decisions especially if they fear it could look weak or irrational and Tony Schwartz argues that kind of blind spot is even larger for Trump who insists he has a flawless temperament I also have a much better temperament than she has well I think I have a great temperament I have a great temperament I have one of the great temperaments I have a winning temperament we need a strong temperament and that's all it is that temperament of course being tested and Trump's own aids our coddling at at times trying to limit the news and negative info that reaches him Schwartz writes in a new piece today Trump's grip on reality will likely continue to diminish as he faces increasing criticism accusations and potential criminal indictments and what happens to a leader who embraces this kind of bunker mentality to avoid stress is Trump seeking a kind of a narrow-minded cocoon of a say a tortured snowflake deluding himself to believe that all critics are just haters and accountability is just what his enemies want I'm reminded of something Canadian philosopher Aubrey Drake Graham once said I got enemies got a lot of enemies got a lot of people trying to drain me on my energy we turn to Tony Schwartz CEO of the energy project Drake of course is known as an emotional celebrity and the problem in that line which reflects the real thing is over identifying any criticism as trying to destroy you rather than deal with it this Trump also have that problem this piece I have done with the psychiatrist and Ely and Politico today is really about the note that people who have Trump psychological disposition Bandys interviewed a thousand of them in her role as a forensic psychiatrist have this vast emptiness that is filled only by external praise and adulation and when they begin to feel that they're not getting enough of it it's a catastrophic internal experience that's what Trump is having right now what's striking about that is we often talk about how different he is from other presidents that's something other politicians have and when I worked in Congress you would see them maybe they don't make it all the way the White House people who were antisocial sometimes tortured and seem to need to be on the go in the action getting praise while maybe other parts of them were were as you put it less full yeah it's why they say Washington and Hollywood have a lot in common the people who seek most intensely public attention are very frequently the people who don't have any inner resources they don't have a sense of themselves absent the external world applauding right it's like these freaks who want to work on TV every day or host of TV's hard to imagine people on little items I don't really I've even MIT haven't even met those what is wrong with your psyche in your life if you need to be on TV hosting a TV show VI was something I've wondered but and then I have no self-awareness either turning back to Donald Trump let me play for you how he dealt with a security analyst in his previous life that was a pretty interesting time I loved security analyst the chairman of the company I worked for was faxed a letter written by Donald Trump what he wanted was a public apology or the firm to dismiss me immediately or he would Institute a major lawsuit against the phone they escorted me to the door I've been a security on us for over 50 years why is that public apology so important who apologized the Donald Trump demanding he didn't get he wants a public apology why because he is so thin-skinned and if a person criticizes him it feels like an inner explosion imagine what he's feeling right now as these walls close around him as the people who have been most loyal to him start to turn on him it's just got to be a feeling of extraordinary fear that is unacceptable to him because he can't stand the experience of weakness or vulnerability and so what he does in its face is to act even more aggressively so does that make him obsessive and emotional in dealing with these open legal probes well yes indeed he's clearly an obsessive guy he's obsessive sometimes strategically sometimes reactively we give you give you an example of the obsessiveness strategically is when he says no collusion no collusion no collusion what is he doing he is hoping he has learned that if he repeats it often enough even if it's totally false visibly false people or a significant number of people will start to believe it right state of mind state of mind state of mind is is what we'll take from that because this is a series we're gonna continue and try to go a little bit deeper so Tony Schwartz I appreciate you being here and being a part of it hey I'm already Melvin from MSNBC you can see more
