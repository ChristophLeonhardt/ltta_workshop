you see that little spike up so it is back to essentially where it was when the president took office just it's such a weird position from my perspective to be like i want to disagree with the president i hate that he's using these like these stats but at the end like i am kind of it's it's it's worse for black people out there than it was a month ago right I think presidents yeah no no please presidents always want to take credit for good news and you know Democratic presidents have done that Republican presidents have done that Bill Clinton did that in the 90s but the reality is you just can't take credit full credit for positive economic growth I think that at the very least we could say that the president might be responsible for some of the positive overall economic growth that we've seen but I mean this is a trend that definitely started under Obama and I think you you run the risk of having egg on your face when you come out and say something like he did during the State of the Union and and also it's just really hard to measure and track these things on a month-to-month basis that's another pitfall and the White House came out and called it a blip that's that was their explanation for it the blip of the of the uptick in unemployment yeah yeah I mean and this is the thing and that's how the economy works it's not like an immediate impact it's like actually we've seen over the years that when you expand when you expand taxes on corporations for example there are windfall benefits but not immediately over you know over a period of years I mean tribes are trying to take credit for everything that Obama did of course if he can't undermine it he'll spin it to make it look like it was really him and also take credit for anything good that happened in 2017 so it's like listen the dollar menu came back no escaped zoo animal California a huge problem here for a long time six dimes in my cat this week alone Oh BOM I didn't find six dime he did not this is this really art this is him fully articulating the strategy behind like trying to reach out to black voters this tweet that he did in January which was african-american unemployment is the lowest ever record in our country the Hispanic unemployment rate dropped a full point the last year and is close to the lowest in recorded history Dems did nothing for you but get your vote this is his entreaty this is what he's trying to do it's like it's bad for you under Democrats you keep voting for them I made unemployment go down vote for me the reaction is like what policies has he put in place to benefit you that's that's the major question in his tweet he said because of my policies this is why we're seeing these low unemployment numbers but what are those actions what are those specific actions that would have a direct correlation to low black unemployment and low unemployment in the Latino community I mean this is a president who is against raising the minimum wage that would disproportionately help people of color working-class people of color in this country is the president who's got the racist Keebler Elf as his Attorney General who is recrimination marijuana across the country like what are you talking like Dems haven't done anything for you and I have its total it is just like it's please don't complain and be happy with your you know your own oppression like you know cuz I'm gonna throw you some crumbs that aren't even my crumbs a claim yeah but like and at the same time he's already that party has already been systematically marginalizing your ability to make a difference with your vote like severe gerrymandering works against you the changes of health care trying to get people off health care who need it the only tangible difference that has been made that can be tracked is the tax cut which has put more money in the hands of corporations which they have used to buy back stocks and and hasn't net and maybe give a quick bonus in the short term but when it comes to to unemployment we're seeing maybe this is the effect of what we have seen under covered which is essentially the letting go of ever of a portion of the workforce that you know received a bonus which now just seems like severance if you want to get the whole young turks show every single day become a member TYT Network calm slash join and once you do you'll be saying get home like a smart person or you might say I think it's weird or you might say oops no that won't be that one it won't be that one it'll be great trust me tu IT Network calm slash joy
